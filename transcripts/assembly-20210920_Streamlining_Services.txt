TO ENSURE THAT SURVIVORS RECEIVE THE BEST CARE AND SUPPORT POSSIBLE THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO EXAMINE INTERPERSONALVIOLENCE DURING THE CALL WITH NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WALL ST HOME ORDERS HAVE SLOWED THE SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEEN THEY HAVE INADVERTENTLY AND UNFORTUNATELY CREATED IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR INTER PERSONAL OR INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE TO INCREASE. AND AS THE PANDEMIC HAS CONTINUED ON SO TOO HAS THE ABUSE. THE PANDEMIC CREATED SOCIAL AND LIVELIHOOD STRESSES SUCH AS INCOME LOSS HOUSING INSTABILITY AND FOOD AND SECURITY WHICH HAS EXASPERATED THE SILENT EPIDEMIC OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE. THIS SELECT COMMITTEE. HEARING WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE CRISIS AMID THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IT WILL ASSESS AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND CURRENT OBSTACLES FOR SUPPORT AND LASTLY DISCUSS STRATEGIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LET FOR THE LEGISLATURE OUR GOAL IS TO SHINE A SPOTLIGHT ON THE PERSISTENT AND GROWING CRISIS OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA HEAR FROM SURVIVORS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND POLICY ADVOCATES AND WERE AND WHAT THE STATE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE WAYS THAT WE SUPPORT VICTIMS.

I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING TODAY'S TESTIMONY AND BEING FURTHER EDUCATED ON THE INTERPERSONAL PROVIDED CRISIS AND WORKING WITH YOU ALL AS YOU CONTINUE THE IMPORTANT WORK YOU DO EVERY DAY ON FIGHTING THIS CRIME AND WORKING TO PROTECT SURVIVORS.

THAT BEFORE- BEFORE CHAIRMAN NAVA STARTS I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM COOPER AND OPEN IT UP FOR- MISTER COOPER TO MAKE. OPENING COMMENTS THANK YOU CHAIRMAN I PLEDGE FOR BEING- YOU KNOW A GOING ON OBVIOUS WITH COBRE- YOU THINK ABOUT LAST YEAR AND A HALF- INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE HAS SKYROCKETED DRAMATICALLY YOU SEEN OUR CHILDREN ABUSED. AND WHAT'S FRUSTRATING FOR MYSELF MISTER GRAYSON AS A LOT AS LEGISLATORS- IS THE BILLS THAT. CONTINUE CUTS THIS LEGISLATURE AND WE NEVER TALK ABOUT THE VICTIMS IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE STATE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND- PAYS MONEY OUT TO VICTIMS. 25% GO TO WOMEN AND CHILDREN ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION A YEAR FOR THAT MONEY. AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GIVEN SOME THAT VICTIMS COMPENSATION MONEY TO OTHER FOLKS THAT- YOU KNOW MY OPINION OR JUST- DON'T DESERVE IT. AND YOU KNOW IT'S IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW A DOMESTIC BUT IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A VIOLENT CRIME. IN THE PENAL CODE RIGHT NOW TODAY'S WE SPEAK SO. IF YOU BEAT YOURSELF UP YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER- YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RELEASE BUT I THINK WHEN YOU IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE ABUSIVE. TO YOUR SPOUSE WE'RE TALKING WITH A FELONY ON THAT. THEY MAYBE SHOULD DO A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THAT AND THAT THAT'S A REALLY BIG ISSUE WHAT WE'RE SAYING WE'RE SEEING VICTIMS GROUPS- THAT ARE AFRAID TO COME FORWARD AND TALK ABOUT SOME THESE ISSUES. BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF FUNDING BEING CUT. AND I SEEN THAT DURING THE PAST YEAR. SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED NEED TO BE TALKED ABOUT IT GOES ON A REGULAR BASIS I SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I'M WHEN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WASN'T TREATED. AS A CRIME AND WHEN THE CHANGES CAME ABOUT. AND I'M RESPONDING TO A CALL AT THE HOSPITAL THIS ONLY BEEN BEATEN WITH JUMPER CABLES BY HER HUSBAND. IN EVERY PORTION OF HER BODY WAS BLACK AND BLUE NUMBER THE EVIDENCE TECHNICIAN TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE HOSPITAL TO DOCUMENT THAT. BUT WE SEE CASES TIME AND TIME AGAIN- IT IT'S FRUSTRATING- HELICOPTERS IN THIS BUILDING THAT SUPPORTS TO- ADDRESS WOMEN. AND CHILDREN'S ISSUES. AND YET ON THE ISSUE OF DOMESTIC- FULL TO SIGN ON IT- WITH THAT WAS PULLED THE YEAR THE BILL FOR BILL MONEY TO. IN UNDER- YOU'RE OF A SUSPECT. THE PERPETRATOR MYSTIC VIOLENCE YOUR PRICE HIS. IF IT INVOLVED MYSTIC VIOLENCE CANNOT CONSIDERED FOR YOUR RELEASE. SO IF YOU'RE ABUSER AND YOU HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF ABUSE- DATA GOING THAT JUST DECISION WHETHER YOU SHOULD GET OUT- ON A LOWER BILL ARE R. O. R. BUT IT'S NOT- SO IT'S THIS IS TIMELY IS GOING ON OUR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ABUSED- THE CHAIR CAME TO BE THE- AND I KEPT THE INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN- ABUSE OF CHILDREN OF HAS GONE UP AS- WELL AS CHILD **** AND THAT. THE CHAIRMAN CAME OUT THERE AND WITH THE END OF THE CAPITOL AND TALKED ABOUT SOME THE INVESTIGATOR STATEWIDE SO- LIKE I SAID WE SEEN SO MANY WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN ABUSED THIS PAST YEAR AND A HALF OF COVERT. AND A LOT OF THEM CAREFULLY THEY CAN GOING TO THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO TURN TO THERE'S SOME GREAT GROUPS OUT THERE BUT NO IT'S TOUGH TO BREAK AWAY FROM YOUR VIEWS OR ITS IT'S HARD. AND SOMETHING GOOD BEGUN SLUG LOOK FORTY HEARING TESTIMONY FROM VICTIMS IN THE PANEL TO HEAR HOW WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB BUT- PART OF THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND IF IT IS IT IS REAL AND IT IS IT'S LIKE SINCE. IT'S FRUSTRATING BUT IT'S FUNNY WHAT NOT FORTIES AND WANTED TO TELL SOMEONE THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT CONSIDERED A VIOLENT FELONY THERE LIKE IT'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS VIOLENCE IN THE NAME. IN EVERY PERSON YOU TALK TO. BUT WE IT SHOULD BE. S. OF IRAQ. IF YOU INFLICT GREAT BALL INJURY BUT IS NOT AN WHICH TO REPEAL TO GET THAT CHANGED THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE CAN'T A CHANGE. SO ITS FIRST HOPEFULLY TO FRUSTRATION VOICE- WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT YOU AND YOUR SUPPORT YOU AND OTHER FOR THE HEARING THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER COOPER AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WE ARE HONORED TO HAVE YOU- WITH YOUR EXPERTISE ON THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE SUPPORT THAT YOU PROVIDE. WITH THAT I WILL NOW TURN BACK TO OUR PANELISTS AND SHERMAN NOT IF YOU WOULD BEGIN. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS PEDRO NAVA AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN OVERSIGHT AGENCY CHARGED WITH MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE GOVERNMENT. IN THE PAST YEAR WE ISSUED TWO REPORTS EXAMINING CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE TO INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. THE SERVICE COULD USE CAN TAKE MANY FORMS PHYSICAL SEXUAL PSYCHOLOGICAL OR FINANCIAL. IT AFFECTS CALIFORNIANS OF ALL-BACKGROUNDS AGES AND GENDER IDENTITIES TRAGICALLY. THE PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED ALREADY DISTRESSING RATES OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE DECLINED EVEN HIGHER. IN OUR MAY TWENTY TWENTY REPORT INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE GETTING THE MONEY TO THE OILS ON THE FRONT LINE WE FOUND THAT RATES OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE INCREASED DURING TIMES OF STRESS. PARTICULARLY ECONOMIC STRESS AND WHEN FAMILIES GATHERED TOGETHER GOLD IN NINETEEN SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES COMBINED BOTH. AFTER GOVERNOR NEWSOM ISSUED A STATEWIDE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY LOCAL OFFICIALS AND SHELTER STAFF ACROSS CALIFORNIA. REPORTED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE COMPARED TO MARKEDLY NINETEEN. ONE CRISIS SHELTER IN SACRAMENTO REPORTED A 17% INCREASE IN CALLS WHILE ONE IN LOS ANGELES. AND A 20% INCREASE. THE FRESNO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT REPORTED FILING 77% MORE DOMESTIC RELATED REPORTS IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY. COMPARED TO THE SAME TIME IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THE IMPACT OF THIS VIOLENCE OFTEN FALL HARDEST ON THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US MANY OF WHOM ARE BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. OUR REPORT FOUND THAT FAMILIES EXPERIENCING ECONOMIC STRESS ARE PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS ABUSE AND THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN MALE UNEMPLOYMENT AND RATES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. BOTH WOMEN AND MEN WHO ARE AMERICAN INDIAN BLACK OR MULTIRACIAL REPORT HIGHER RATES OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE THAN THEIR PEERS OF OTHER RACES. WOMEN WHO LIVE IN SMALL RURAL TOWNS ARE SIMILARLY VULNERABLE TO INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. AND ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER EXTENSIVE PROPERTY DAMAGE AND BE MURDERED BY THEIR PARTNER THAN WOMEN IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS. SADLY THE CALL WITH NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF THIS ABHORRENT ABUSE TO ACCESS LIFE SAVING RESOURCES. THE FEAR OF CATCHING CALL THE NINETEEN HAS PREVENTED SOME VICTIMS FROM SEEKING EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE HOSPITAL. AND WHILE MANY HEALTH PROVIDERS IN TURN TO TELL HEALTH AS A WAY TO PROVIDE SOCIALLY DISTANCE CARE TO THEIR PATIENTS THOSE LIVING IN ABUSIVE HOUSEHOLDS CAN STRUGGLE TO FIND THE PRIVACY NECESSARY. TO SPEAK WITH THEIR DOCTORS OR THERAPISTS. ACCESSING HELP IS DIFFICULT WHEN ABUSERS ALSO ISOLATE THEIR PARTNERS FROM SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORKS ABUSERS USE NUMEROUS TACTIC TO PREVENT OUR PARTNER FROM REACHING THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND THE RESOURCES THAT WILL HELP THEM. ESCAPE DURING OUR STUDY ON INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE THE COMMISSION HEARD STORIES OF SURVIVORS WHOSE ABUSERS PREVENTED THEM FROM LEAVING THE HOUSE TO GO TO WORK OR TO SCHOOL. PLACES WHERE THEY COULD RECEIVE HELP FROM FROM THEIR FRIENDS OR CO WORKERS OR TEACHERS. WE HEARD OF ABUSERS TO TAKE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE FAMILY RESOURCES. METICULOUSLY TRACKING THE VICTIM'S USE OF MONEY AND PREVENTING THEM FROM ACCESSING FUNDS IN A SHARED BANK ACCOUNT. THIS BEHAVIOR IS COMMON AMONG ABUSERS ONE STUDY ON SURVIVOR FINANCIAL INSECURITY FOUND THAT 1100% OF SURVIVORS IN THE SAMPLE EXPERIENCE SOME FORM OF ECONOMIC ABUSE DURING THE RELATIONSHIP. WHEN SURVIVORS ARE ABLE TO ESCAPE THEIR ABUSERS OFTEN WITH NO MONEY AND NO WAY TO MAKE AN INCOME FOR THEMSELVES. THEY STRUGGLE. TO SURVIVE ON THEIR OWN. SOME GO BACK TO ABUSER BECAUSE THEY AFFORD TO STAY AWAY. NOW MORE THAN EVER IT'S CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT SURVIVORS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. THE RESOURCES THEY NEED NOT ONLY TO ESCAPE THEIR ABUSER BUT TO ESTABLISH A LIFE ON THEIR OWN. IN OUR JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT BEYOND THE CRISIS A LONG TERM APPROACH TO REDUCE PREVENT AND RECOVER FROM THE PARTNER VIOLENCE THE COMMISSION PROVIDES A ROAD. FOR MORE EFFECTIVELY PREVENTING THIS APPEARS HELPING SURVIVORS AND REHABILITATING PERPETRATORS. FIRST CALIFORNIA MUST ADOPT A STATE WIDE STRATEGY FOCUSED ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND APPOINT A LEADER WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE. FOR SUN STRATEGY WE NEED TO MAKE HELP AVAILABLE BE FOR VICTIMS ARE IN SIX SECONDS THE STATE MUST AND FUND PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. ANTI VIOLENCE INITIATIVES SUCH AS- BATTERER INTERVENTION PROGRAMS MUST BE MORE ACCESSIBLE AND DIVERSE SO THAT THE STATE CAN HELP MORE PEOPLE. THIRD CALIFORNIA MUST INCREASE ENFORCEMENT. OF THIS EXISTING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATED FIREARM LOS TO IMMEDIATELY REMOVE WEAPONS FROM PEOPLE. FROM OWNING THEM. THE STATE CAN BETTER ENFORCE THESE LAWS BY MODERNIZING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FIREARMS DATABASES. AND REWORKING THE SPECIAL AGENT CLASSIFICATION TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE AND FINALLY THE STATE MUST EXPAND PROMOTE AND DEDICATE FUNDING. THE RESOURCES THAT HELP SURVIVORS ESTABLISH FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE SECURE HOUSING AND. GAIN VALUABLE JOB EXPERIENCE. SUCH RISKS LOOKING INCLUDE CONNECTING SURVIVE WITH APPRENTICESHIP. THEY CAN EARN A LIVING THEY CAN THEIR EDUCATION. CREATE STABLE SUSTAINABLE TO EXPAND DOMESTIC. HOUSING FIRST PROGRAM IN HELPING THE HELPERS THE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ASSIST SURVIVORS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE BY REQUIRING ITS STATE GRANTS PROVIDE A LIVING WAGE AND COST OF LIVING INCREASES AWARDEES WE MUST PROVIDE FOR. THOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS TODAY CONTINUE THEIR CRUCIAL WORK. GREATER ACTION MUST BE TAKEN TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA RESPONDS. RIGOROUSLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO THE HORRIFIC ABUSE THAT IS INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS WILL HELP THE STATE CREATE A COORDINATED COHESIVE STRATEGY TO PREVENT DISOBEDIENCE AND SUPPORT SURVIVORS WITH THEIR LONG TERM NEEDS YEAH IT'S AN HONOR TO BE A PART OF THIS PANEL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING. COMMENTS QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES FROM THOSE ARE PART OF THE SCHOOLS WELL THANK. AND THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THAT GREAT TESTIMONY AND WE WILL NOW MOVE TO THE HONORABLE DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY. SANDUSKY'S MICROPHONES YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON AND COOPER FOR HAVING THIS HEARING I REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE ONE MOMENT THANK- MISTER NAVA FOR THE ALL THE WORK THAT THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION IS DOING I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM ON THE LABOR TRAFFICKING ISSUES AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF THINK TANK REALLY HELP GUIDE US. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- TIE WANNA TALK ABOUT INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE AT THE TIME OF CODED. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT IS VERY VERY HIDDEN PERVASIVE EXPLOITATION OF INDIVIDUALS. ON SO MANY LEVELS. THE VERY TOOLS THAT WE USED TO KEEP PEOPLE COBIT FREE HAVE NOW IMPACTED VICTIMS OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE IN THE MOST DEVASTATING WAY. COVETOUS CAUSE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STRESS ON FAMILIES. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT SOMEONE WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE AN ABUSER HAS BECOME AN ABUSER GIVEN THE STRESSORS THAT EXISTS IN OUR SOCIETY. UNEMPLOYMENT OF LACK OF RESOURCES BEING CONFINED IN THE HOME. AND I AND SO THERE ARE FAMILIES THAT WERE REALLY ILL EQUIPPED. A BECAUSE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. WE ALSO SEE THAT- THAT WITH THE SHELTER IN PLACE THAT FOR THOSE THAT HAVE A VIOLENT TENDENCY OR HAVE BEEN VIOLENT PAST. HAVE ONLY ESCALATED AND NOT ONLY AGAINST THE ADULT VICTIM THEIR PARTNER BUT ALSO AGAINST CHILDREN. AND ONE OF THE STATE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE NOTICED IS THAT WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER. REFERENCE IN THAT IS THAT AN ABUSER GETS ARRESTED THEY'RE BROUGHT TO JAIL THEY'RE BOOKED AND THEN THEY'RE RELEASED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE EMERGENCY BELL SCHEDULE WITHOUT EVEN TIME FOR THE VICTIM TO FIND. TO TRY TO SEEK RESOURCES TO GET AWAY FROM THAT TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT HOUSE. BUT MANY OF THE WE ALSO FOUND DO TO COPE IS THAT VICTIMS OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE. HAD NO ACCESS TO HOSPITALS THEY COULD GO TO THE HOSPITAL BUT THERE WAS NO THERE WERE NO ADVOCATE RESOURCES THERE. BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ALLOWING OTHER PEOPLE INTO THE HOSPITAL. AND FOR MANY THE HOSPITAL WAS NOT EVEN A SAFE PLACE BECAUSE HOSPITALS ARE DEALING WITH COBIT. AND SO GOING TO THE HOSPITAL AND HAVING AT LEAST A MANDATORY REPORT. MADE TO THE POLICE SO THERE COULD BE SOME FOLLOW UP. A LOT OF THAT WAS DROPPING OFF THE WAYSIDE BECAUSE OF THE- CONDITIONS THAT CODE HAD. MANY OF THE SERVICES AS YOU MENTIONED ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON BECAME REMOTE OUR MEDICAL SERVICES BECAME REMOTE. WHICH IS. CAN BE EFFECTIVE AFTER BUT NOT FOR THE IMMEDIATE. INTERVENTION SHELTERS ALSO HAD TREMENDOUS- CHALLENGES THIS YEAR BECAUSE IF A SHELTER HAD A POSITIVE COBIT TEST THEY HAD TO CLEAR OUT THE SHELTERS SO I KNOW IN MY COUNTY THEY PURCHASE HOTELS. AND WE'RE READ THE OUR SHELTER PARTNERS WERE USING HOTELS TO BE ABLE TO HOUSE PEOPLE BUT IT WAS NOT OPTIMAL FOR SURE- AND PEOPLE WERE TO ME IN HOTEL ROOMS DON'T HAVE IN MOTEL ROOMS DON'T HAVE KITCHENS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE WAY TO GET HEALTHY EATING IF OR EVEN. BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF KIDS I PERSONALLY SAW WOMEN WHO WERE LIVING IN CARS WITH THEIR CHILDREN WHO FLED THEIR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I KNOW HERE WITH US TODAY AND THE AUDIENCE IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MY FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER SABRINA FERAL. AND THERE'S SO MANY WOMEN THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HELP OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE THEIR ONLY OTHER OPTION IS TO LIVE IN THE CAR THAT HAD TO BE AWAY FROM THE VIOLENT ENVIRONMENT. BUT IN L. AS GOING ALONG WITH THAT THERE'S IT AS IT WAS POINTED OUT BY MR NOT AT THAT THE LACK OF HOUSING. OF AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR EMERGENCY HOUSING POSE GREAT CHALLENGES FOR US. ESPECIALLY WHAT WE SEE WHICH IS. BEEN EXACERBATED THROUGH COVERED IS THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE PETS. WHAT I OFTENTIMES NOT LEAVE UNLESS THEY COULD BRING THEIR PET WITH THEM. BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT IF THEY LEFT THE PET BACK THE PET WAS LIKELY TO BE KILLED. OR ABUSED ITSELF. CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS HAVE BECOME VERY MUCH MORE VULNERABLE- BECAUSE AGAIN EVERYBODY WAS SHELTERED IN HOME AND THEY WERE SHELTERED IN HOME WITH WITH ABUSIVE PEOPLE. SO THE A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES ALSO HAD TO GO REMOTE I KNOW IT OUR FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER MANY OF OUR PARTNERS WORK OFF SITE- WE DID WHEN CO WITH FIRST HIT IS THAT WE CLOSED DOWN FOR THREE DAYS TO DO A DEEP CLEAN OF THE AND- TIRE FACILITY- BUT  LOT OF THOSE. A LOT OF THE SERVICES ARE BEING DONE REMOTELY WHICH IS NOT THE SAME ESPECIALLY IN THAT CRITICAL TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER THE VICTIM SURVIVORS COME FORWARD TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HER. OR HIM IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THERE WAS PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS THERE WERE NO OPTIONS AND SO WHAT WE STARTED TO DO WAS TO CREATE POSTERS WORK WITH THE GROCERS ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALLOWED US TO GIVE THEM POSTERS FOR EACH COUNTY WITH RESOURCE NUMBERS THEY WERE IN ALL THE GROCERY STORE SO SOMEBODY EITHER A PERSON WHO IS BEING ABUSED OR SOMEONE WHO KNEW A PERSON BEING ABUSE COULD NO HELP WAS OUT THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS A GREAT LACK OF COMMUNICATION DURING COVERT EVERYTHING WAS ABOUT COBIT. AND EVERYTHING WAS ABOUT STAY HOME AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S THERE WAS HELP AVAILABLE TO THEM. THE- A CENTURY PEOPLE BECAME PRISONERS IN THEIR OWN HOME AND IT WAS GREAT BIG CHALLENGES FOR THEM BEING ABLE TO SEEK HELP. THE. SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AS I SAID IS THAT WE CREATED OUR STRATEGY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE BEING NOT JUST STRATEGIC BUT COMPREHENSIVE SO OUR FIRST STRATEGY WAS THAT WE NEEDED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THERE WAS HELP AND THAT THERE WAS A WAY TO GET AWAY FROM THAT ENVIRONMENT THAT VIOLENT ENVIRONMENT. WE TRIED TO ENGAGE YOUTH ALSO WE WORKED WITH COMCAST TO BECAME A GREAT PARTNER FOR US TO PUT COMMERCIALS AND PSAS ON WE WORKED WITH A SOCIAL MEDIA WE WORK WITH RADIO STATIONS WE JUST GOT THE WORD OUT THAT HELP WAS AVAILABLE. AND WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT PEOPLE STARTED COMING TO THE JUSTICE CENTER. NOW OF COURSE WE ARE VERY CAREFUL ALSO BECAUSE WE HAD STAFF ON SITE. SO WE HAD BIG BIG BASKETS OF MASKS AND HAND SANITIZER EVERYWHERE. GLASS PUT UPPER FOUNDED THE BARRIERS SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY SEE PEOPLE ADDITIONALLY AND THEN EVENTUALLY WE COULD TRANSITION THEM TO BEING HELPED REMOTELY. OF THE COUNT THE KEY WAS TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THERE WAS HELP SO. WE WORKED AT THE GROCERY STORES WHAT WE REALIZED WAS THAT WE HAD A LOT OF OUR OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE ALSO SERVICING BEING SERVICED BY THE FOOD BANK. SO WE TOOK THOSE BIG POSTERS AND MADE HIM SMALL AND WE PUT HIM IN EVERY SIX EVERY SINGLE FOOD BANK BAG. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE REALLY STARTED TO SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING THE HAVING THE COURAGE TO MAKE THE PHONE CALL. OR TO COME AND SEE US- IT WAS ALSO HAPPENING IN- IN FAMILIES THAT WE STARTED SEEING AN INCREASE BOTH IN THE INTENSITY OF THE VIOLENCE MUCH MORE INTENSE INJURY HOSPITALS ARE CALLING US AT THE JUSTICE CENTER ASKING US TO HAVE MORE IMMEDIATE HELP- THAT WE SAW LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORTING A STRONGER AND MORE SEVERE INJURIES. AND WE SAW WE REMINDED OURSELVES THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE MEANS HAD THE ABILITY TO LEAVE IF THEY COULD PSYCHOLOGICALLY BUT THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO GO TO A HOTEL OR GO STAY WITH FAMILY OR FRIENDS- WE WERE REALLY FOCUSING ON PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE THAT OPTION. WE ALSO IN ADDITION TO OUR PSAS AND ARE OUT REACHES WE TALK TO CHILDREN. WE TALK TO CHILDREN ABOUT THE DANGERS OF AND HOW THEY COULD THAT TELL SOMEONE IF SOMETHING WAS SOMEBODY WAS HURTING HIM I KNOW HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD BANNERS ON THE SCREEN FOR THE KIDS THEY WERE THEY WERE IN SCHOOL REMOTELY SAYING. IF SOMEONE'S HURTING YOU YOU CAN CALL SOMEONE YOU CAN CALL THE NUMBER. THE AND THEN WE WORK WITH TEACHERS WHO ARE ONLINE WITH THE KIDS TO THAT THEY COULD PAY ATTENTION IF THEY WERE SAYING SOMETHING THAT WAS OUT OF. OUT OF SORTS. AS I SAID BECAUSE OF THE SHELTER BECAUSE OF A CODE IN THE SHELTERS THAT WE HAD TO DO WE STARTED USING HOTEL ROOMS. AND WE WERE VERY CLOSE TO PURCHASING A NINETY ROOM HOTEL THAT WOULD HAD SIX FLOORS THAT WE WERE GOING TO CONVERT INTO. A SAFE AND- HOW SAFE HOUSING FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN- BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT. BUT SO FAR SINCE KOBE TO SAP HAS STARTED IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE- HOUSED OVER SIX HUNDRED WOMEN. BOTH THROUGH EMERGENCY HOUSING. SOME HAVING TO GOING TO HOTEL ROOMS WE'VE HAD TO PIVOT. TO HAVE FOOD ON SITE TO GIVE THEM FOOD THAT CAN BE COOKED IN A MICROWAVE. BECAUSE AGAIN WE ASSUME HERE YOU'RE SAFE IN THE ROOM. BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO EAT. AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FEED YOUR CHILDREN. SO WE BUY% FOOD AND OUR FOOD BANK TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT FOOD THAT'S EXCEPT THAT IT. IS ACCEPTABLE FOR. DURING HOTEL ROOMS. THE BUT WE ALSO HAD TO WE ALSO HAVE A STRATEGY OF MOVING PEOPLE AWAY FROM THEIR HOME BASE. IN SO THEY'LL BE OUT IN THE EAST PART OF OUR COUNTY AS OPPOSED TO NORTH PART OF THE COUNTY AND VICE VERSA. WE WORK WITH PARTNERS THEN TO FIND PERMANENT HOUSING AND WE'VE BEEN A RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING MORE PERMANENT HOUSING. BUT THE RESOURCES AREN'T THERE FOR VICTIM SURVIVORS TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES. AND THAT'S A BIG THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE IS I LIKE WHAT THE RECOMMENDATION WAS FROM THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION TO HAVE A- YOU KNOW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FIRST HOUSING. INITIATIVE SO THAT PEOPLE AT LEAST HAVE A WAY TO GET INTO. LIVING I KNOW THAT THROUGH THE VICTIMS OF CRIME. THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO PAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RENT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S HAD TO BE. EMERGENCY RELOCATED AND WE UTILIZE ALL OF THOSE SERVICES FOR VICTIMS- BUT THE KEY IS MAKING SURE THAT VICTIMS KNOW THAT THAT'S AVAILABLE. FOR US AT THE END OF THE DAY. COBIT IS GIVEN US THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GIVE MORE FOCUS TO EMPOWERING VICTIMS. BECAUSE WE CAN HELP THEM IN A RECENT BY RESPONDING WE CAN HELP THEM WITH INITIAL RESOURCES WE CAN DO A LOT OF THAT. BUT OUR GOA IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT VICTIM SURVIVOR WALKS AWAY. OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN. SO AT THE JUSTICE CENTER WE HAVE A FOOD HUB WE THOUGHT THAT WE'D BE GIVING OUT FOOD AS FOOD AS MEDICINE WHICH IS A GREAT INITIATIVE OF KALAMAZOO COUNTY. IT'S NOT JUST GO GET YOUR MEDICINE FOR YOUR DIABETES AND THEN GO TO YOUR FRESH VEGETABLES SO THAT YOU CAN USE FOOD AS MEDICINE AS WELL. DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT SO NOW WE HAVE GIFT CARDS THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME FOR ANY SESSION WE GIVE THEM GIFT CARDS TO. TO A DIFFERENT PLACES TARGET I HAVE TO SAY HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE PARTNER TO US. AND HELPING PROVIDE RESOURCES TO US SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THEM TO THE VICTIMS AND THE CLIENTS OF SURVIVORS. WE HAVE ONGOING HEALTH CLASSES NOW. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO SHOP ECONOMICALLY HOW TO. MAKE FOOD WE HAVE COOKING CLASSES ONLINE. WE HAVE WE PROVIDED WITH SUPPLIES- WE ENGAGE WITH THE TRADES WITH THE UNIONS WE NOW HAVE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY WOMEN. WHO HAVE. BEEN ABLE TO BECOME CODE WRITERS. BECAUSE OF ONE OF OUR PARTNERSHIPS WE HAVE WOMEN THAT ARE NOW CARPENTERS. AND ELECTRICIANS ENTERING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. AND THESE ARE ALL WAYS THAT WE'RE HELPING TO END THAT CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. BECAUSE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND NOT BE DEPENDENT. ON A PERSON WHO'S ABUSING THEM. WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO THROUGH GRANTS THAT WE RECEIVED WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE CHROMEBOOKS FOR THOSE. WHO ARE WORKING WITH US AND OTHERS I MEAN FOR MANY OF THE FAMILIES THEY DIDN'T HAVE pCOMPUTERS. SO WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE. A AND I WILL SAY THAT- THANKFULLY BECAUSE WE'VE GOTTEN ALL THE THESE GRANTS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. DO MUCH MOREIN TERMS OF PROVIDING SUPPORT AND RESOURCES. WITH THE CHILDREN WE DID CONTINUE OUR CAMPO. AT BUT WE DID IN OUR PARKING LOT. INSTEAD OF AWAY CAMP ALTHOUGH THIS SUMMER WE DID HAVE A WAY CAMPS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES AS THE COURTS CLOSED. AND YOU THERE IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A PROTECTIVE ORDER ESPECIALLY AN EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER. WHEN THE COURTS CLOSE DOWN. THAT OR THEY WERE BECAME REMOTE THERE WAS IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TECHNOLOGY YOU COULD NOT. IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT SO. THAT'S BEEN A HUGE PROBLEM FOR US ALSO WITH TRYING TO PROCESS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES THROUGH COURT. IS ACCUSED HUGE ISSUE AND THE COURTS ARE NOW STARTING TO OPEN BACK UP. BUT OF COURSE A BIG BIG CHALLENGES WITH CODED WHO CAN ACTUALLY COME INTO A COURT ROOM. HOW CAN THEY DO IT SO AT THE JUSTICE CENTER WE'VE SET UP A SYSTEM. WHERE THEY CAN COME THERE WE CAN HELP THEM GET THEIR MERCY ORDERS. AND THEN HELP THEM ONE OF OUR PARTNERS HELPS IN IN THE COURTROOM WE SEND OUR NAVIGATORS TO BE WITH PEOPLE IN COURT. OR AT LEAST ONLINE IN COURT. WE WANT TO THE SURVIVORS TO COME OUT OF THIS EXPERIENCE. EMPOWERED AND STRONGER. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE WE'VE JUST REALLY BY WE REALLY HAVE GIVEN FOCUS WHERE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF. DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER. THEY GET OUT OF BED THAT EXPERIENCE. OUR PROGRAM IS CALLED STEP UP. OF WHICH IS ABOUT. FINANCIAL LITERACY AND OTHER OTHER- AWARENESS PROGRAMS. WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WHERE WOMEN ARE LEARNING HOW TO. TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN NEEDS TAKEN. CHANGE ELECTRICAL OUTLETS THEY CAN FIX OUR OWN CARS. IT'S QUITE AMAZING WHAT THEY'RE DOING. WE'VE GOT HOW TO SHOP SMART. WE HAVE A WORKING WITH DIG DEEP FARMS WHERE WOMEN ARE LEARNING HOW TO GROW THEIR OWN FOOD. AND ESPECIALLY WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING THE CHILDREN WITH HAVE HOMEWORK HELPER. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANY OF THESE YOUNG KIDS TO HAVE ACTUALLY GOTTEN AN EDUCATION BY A COMPUTER SCREEN. AND WE'RE SO CONCERNED. THAT THESE CHILDREN HAVE MISSED A YEAR. PLUS OF EDUCATION. WHICH WE KNOW THAT. THAT PUTS THEM ALREADY AT A DISADVANTAGE AS THEY GROW INTO ADULTHOOD. AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THE LAST THING IS THAT- WE ARE TRUMP RECOVERY CENTER AS WELL. AND THAT WE HAVE A PHD IN FIVE THERAPISTS WHO WORK AT THE TRUMP RECOVERY CENTER. SOME OF THOSE ARE BEING DONE REMOTELY QUITE EFFECTIVELY WE'VE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE THAT WE'VE SERVED IN THE LAST YEAR. AT THE JUSTICE CENTER TEN THOUSAND CLIENTS HAVE COME TO THE IT JUST SINCE JANUARY WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE. THAN WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST. AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS- IN DUE IN LARGE PART DUE TO. BOTH THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AS WELL AS THE ON GOING SUPPORT THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND ANY AND MEN WE SERVE ABOUT A THOUSAND MANY YEAR. WHO ARE ON THEMSELVES VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- IF I COULD JUST SAY ONE MORE THING AND THAT IS THAT- I JUST. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE BUT WE'RE ALSO SEEING A HUGE INCREASE IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING VIOLENCE AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS. AND NO ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT'S BEEN A VERY STRONG FOCUS OF YOURS. WE HAD WE LOOKED AT ONLINE ADS. FOR ONE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD IN MY COMMUNITY AND THERE WERE ELEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE AD SELLING WOMEN AND GIRLS FOR SEX. WE WHAT WE COULD NARROW THAT DOWN TO NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE SEPARATE WOMEN. AND OUR ANALYTICS TOLD US THAT AT LEAST TWENTY. AND THERE'S SO MUCH VIOLENCE ON THE STREET BOTH FROM TRAFFICKERS WHO ARE TRYING TO CONTROL THE VICTIM FROM PURCHASERS WHO ARE. DOING THIS AND IT'S SO FRIGHTENING THAT THIS IS ALL STILL HAPPENING IN THE TIME OF COBIT WHICH MAKES ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUALS SO INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE. AND THEN WE SEEING MORE VIOLENCE BETWEEN THE- THE TRAFFICKED INDIVIDUALS. SO THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE'RE DOING NOW OUT ON THE STREET AND TRYING TO PRY BRING THESE RESOURCES TO TRAFFICKED VICTIMS WE'RE TRYING A LOT OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES. WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP OF TWENTY PARTNER AGENCIES JUST TRYING TO ADDRESS THE VIOLENCE OF TRAFFICKED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON THE STREETS ARE ON THE INTERNET IN AT LEAST ALAMEDA COUNTY AND BEYOND- AND SO. YOU KNOW ANYTHING WITH THAT WE CAN DO TO FURTHER BOTH FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT OR FROM ANY OTHER STANDPOINT- WE'RE WE'RE ALWAYS STAND READY TO HELP. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU DIEGO O'MALLEY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR THE PASSION THAT YOU HAVE BEEN. THE EFFORT AND ENERGY YOU PUT INTO THIS NOW WE WILL TURN TO MICHAEL READY. SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL.

THE TOTAL CALLS- DATA WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED IN THE CRIME IN CALIFORNIA PUBLICATION THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL RELEASED IN JULY. AND IT'S WORTH NOTING OF COURSE THAT THIS DATA. IS BASED ON REPORTING FROM LOCAL ENTITIES AND MAY VERY WELL BE INCOMPLETE. AS YOU CAN SEE LOOKING ON THE SLIDE THE TWENTY TWENTY SHE'S ME IN TWENTY TWENTY WE SAW THE BIGGEST YEAR TO YEAR DROP IN CALLS ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS AS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR TWO YEAR DATA OF THE PRECEDING FIVE YEARS. IF WE COMPARE THE AVERAGE OF THE FIVE YEARS PRECEDING TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ITSELF REPORTING CALLS DECREASED BY TWO POINT NINE PERCENT. REPORTED ARRESTS DECREASED BY THIRTEEN POINT 6% AND REPORTED CONVICTIONS DECREASED BY THIRTY SEVEN POINT TWO PERCENT. WHILE SOME OF THE DRUG COULD BE EXPLAINED BY FEWER ACTUAL ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS DELAYS IN REPORTING DATA TO THE DEPARTMENT LIKELY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE REDUCED NUMBERS. AND WE CAN MOVE TO THAT SECOND SLIDE. THE SECOND SLIDE WAS COMPILED BY DOJ RC IT'S BASED ON THE DATA FROM A C. H. S. PROVIDING ARREST DATA WHICH IS REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED TO US AT THE TIME OF ARREST MUHAMMAD IS ARRESTED AND BOOKED ON A PARTICULAR CHARGE. THE DATA IS SENT TO US THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE DATA THROUGH AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON HERE. AS YOU CAN SEE LOOKING AT THE CHART THAT SHOWS AVAILABLE DATA ON ARRESTS BY MONTH FROM TWENTY TWENTY SHE'S ME FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. JUST LOOKING AT JANUARY AND FEBRUARY ARRESTS STATE ABOUT THE SAME BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY PRE PANDEMIC THERE WERE ABOUT 1-000-020-0210 THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED ARRESTS PER MONTH EACH YEAR IN THE PRECEDING FIVE YEARS AND ABOUT TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THREE AND TWENTY TWENTY RIGHT MIDDLE. SAME WITH FEBRUARY THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS AVERAGED IN THE HIGH NINE THOUSANDS AND LOW TEN THOUSANDS IN THE PRECEDING FIVE YEARS AND FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY CAME IN RIGHT AT NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY NINE. HOWEVER STARTING IN MARCH WE START TO SEE A NOTABLE DROP THE FIRST FULL MONTH OF THE PANDEMIC APRIL TWENTY TWENTY SIDE DECREASE IN ARRESTS FROM ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN THOUSAND A MONTH IN THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS DOWN 280-004-0070 THAT TREND CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF TWENTY TWENTY AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS PER MONTH AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS CLOSER TO THE PANDEMIC MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY. THAN ANY PRECEDING YEAR. THIS IS OF COURSE AN EXTREMELY LIMITED SNAPSHOT AND AS I SAID BEFORE IT'S BASED ON IN MANY INSTANCES DATA THAT'S REPORTED FROM FROM LOCAL AGENCIES. THIS IS THAT SAID THE DATA THAT WE HAVE. THE DATA OF COURSE DOES NOT AND CANNOT TELL THE FULL STORY IT DOES NOT TELL THE STORIES OF INDIVIDUAL VICTIMS THESE VICTIMS ARE NOT NUMBERS AND THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCES CANNOT BE REPRESENTED NEARLY THREE CHARTS. LIKEWISE IT DOES NOT TELL THE FULL STORY THE PANDEMIC WE KNOW FROM STUDIES STORIES HAVING BEEN THERE AND FROM THE TESTIMONY THAT WILL HEAR AND HAVE HEARD TODAY. THAT CLOSED COURTS DELAYED REPORTING TO DOJ AND CHANGES IN THE LOCAL DATA SYSTEMS MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE CLIENT TO SEE AND THE TWENTY TWENTY DATA. TO EXPLAIN THIS DATA WE NEED TO HELP THE VICTIMS ADVOCATES LAW ENFORCEMENT'S AND EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. FORTUNATELY THIS ROMAN THIS PANEL HAS PLENTY OF THOSE. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THEM AND HOPE THAT TOGETHER WE CAN WORK TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH YOU ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU OUR PARTNERS TO FACE THESE CHALLENGES HEAD ON. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER REDDING AND I- WANT TO DEFER TO MY- COMMITTEE MEMBER IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS AND I ALSO HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION AS WELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANNA THINK THE MAIL YOU FOR ALL YOU DO I HAVE THE PASSION YOUR VOICE AND ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE. IN SUPPORT OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN IS IT'S FANTASTIC AND JUST KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK- IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY LAST YEAR. WE HAD ME PULLS UP REAL QUICK. WITH TWELVE THOUSAND PLUS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES REPORTED DURING COVERT. NUMBER TEN- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOMICIDES. THAT'S A LOT- THE BIG PART REFER THE VICTIMS BUT THIS BETTER INTERVENTION AND ONE THING WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. IS WITH COVERT- FOLKS GET RELEASED- THE ABUSERS. AND THEY HAVE PROGRAMS THAT OBVIOUSLY WITH YOUR INCARCERATED YOU'RE GOING TO MAYBE ALCOHOLISM OR SUBSTANCE ABSE PROGRAMS. AND ALSO ANGER MANAGEMENT THEN ONCE THEY GO OUTSDE- IF THEY DON'T CONTINUE THE COURSES- NOTHING HAPPENS AND THAT'S. REALLY A BIG ISSUE IS TRYING TO GET THEM. DOES A LOT OF THESE FOLKS BILLION TO BE THERE LIVE. AND GET THEM BACK ON. THE RIGHT TRACK. YES WE'VE BEEN BECAUSE END OF PAROLE. SPECIFIC PAROLE. IF YOU DON'T ATTEND YOUR PROGRAMS. YOU'RE NOT THERE'S NOTHING NOTHING HAPPENS TO YOU. ALSO SELECT OUT THERE SO SOMEHOW WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT- TO CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR WITH THAT. BUT YOU FOLKS THAT HAVE MISTER PROGRAMS IN THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT I'M- MISSING THOSE PROGRAMS WERE IN. THE FACILITY YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER OVER. THE OLD DAYS IT WAS FLASHING CARCERI SOMEONE FOR THIRTY DAYS. TO GET BACK ON THAT TRACK SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE MAYBE. DEAL MILITANTS THAT DOT SUGGESTION. TO HOW WE HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT. WELL I KNOW THAT. FOR SOME OF THE COUNTY SO WE'RE NOT UNDER THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S EMERGENCY ORDER ANYMORE. BUT FOR SOME OF THE COUNTIES THEY ARE. AS SOMEBODY WHO VIOLATES THEY CAN COME BE BROUGHT BACK IN AND THEY'LL PUT A BELL ON THEM. SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY CAN MEET NEED TO STAY AND I THINK THAT YOUR POINT IS THAT THERE HAS TO BE A CONSEQUENCE FOR THE ACTION. AND IF THERE'S NO CONSEQUENCE IN THERE'S NO DETERRENT TO. STOP ENGAGING IN THE CONDUCT. SO HAVING THE FLASHING CORPORATION YOU TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER THING THAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT WE IT IS MANDATED IN CALIFORNIA THAT AND- SOMEONE WHO'S CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. MUST PARTICIPATE IN A FIFTY TWO WEEK DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAM. BUT THAT IS- THERE'S ALL THAT REALLY ENFORCED. AND TO THE SAME TO THE SAME POINT THAT. IF SOMEBODY IS ORDER TO GO TO A TREATMENT PROGRAM. THAT AND THEY JUST DON'T SHOW UP. OR IN MY COUNTY WE HAD ONE WHERE THEY WERE JUST GOING AND PAYING A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND LEAVING. OUT WE HAVE TO HAVE I BELIEVE MORE TEETH. TO THAT SO THE COURT WILL ACTUALLY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY IT'S REPORTED BACK TO THEM THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL. IS NOT ATTENDING THE PROGRAM- THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH AROUND THE PROGRAM'S A FIFTY TWO WEEK PROGRAM IS. SET WITH THE STANDARD CURRICULUM. AND THERE'S SOME MOVEMENT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED MORE DID MORE DIRECTLY ABOUT WHAT THEIR ISSUES ARE BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY IS. BEING DRIVEN BY THE SAME BEHAVIOR OR THE SAME- ISSUES AND- I DO SUPPORT THAT I KNOW WITH OUR SEX OFFENDER MANAGEMENT BOARD. THAT YOU'RE LEGISLATURE PASSED LEGISLATION THAT WE PUT A SPONSORED. TO INDIVIDUALIZE THE TREATMENT TO HAVE PEOPLE ASSESSED. AND THAT REALLY IS ABOUT A RISK ASSESSMENT AND I THINK IF WE LOOK AT. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE LOOK AT OTHER CRIMES OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE. LOOKING AT RISK IS REALLY THE KEY. AND IF WE CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF RE OFFENDING THEN. WE HAVE THE ENGAGEMENT HAS BEEN WORTH IT. UP BUT I AND THAT'S ONE AREA WHERE I THINK WE SHOULD WE COULD EXPLORE MORE. WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FIRST TO MATCH IT STILL LOOK AT THIS FAMILY MATTER. AND WE WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT OF THAT REALM AND RECOGNIZES THE VIOLENT CRIME THAT IT IS. THANK YOU THE EVER MISTER READING ON YOU TALK ABOUT THE REPORTS DOJ GETS THIS EVERY CITY REPORT THEIR DATA ARE ONLY CITIES OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION I BELIEVE THIS IS EVER AND IT SHOULD COME FROM THE COUNTY'S I BELIEVE BUT IT IT IT SHOULD NOT BE- JUST THE COUNTIES ARE JUST THE CITIES THAT ARE UNDER A CERTAIN POPULATION IT IT'S EVERYBODY COULD YOU ARE SOMETIMES WITH WITH WITH FBI UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING WHATEVER THAT IS- THE ONLY GET REPORTS OF CITIES OVER HER THOUSANDS POPULATION. SO THAT SKEWS NUMBERS FOR A LOT OF TALK ABOUT ASSAULT AND THE THINGS THAT WE SKEWS NUMBER SO I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT NO THAT'S IT YOU BRING UP A VERY GOOD POINT AND THE REALITY IS THAT- ARE THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN THE FBI HAS IN PLACE TO TRACK SOME OF THIS- WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW WASTE WASTE TO IMPROVE IT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS CERTAINLY LOOKING AT AND LOOKING TO- MOVE FORWARD ON THAT JUST AS A MATTER OF A FACT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION FROM WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION FROM TWENTY TWENTY SEP FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT MOST OF THE DATA THAT WE HAVE IS FROM A YEAR AGO AND MOST OF THE DATA WE HAVE- AS I SAID IT IT MAY WELL BE THAT THERE'S MORE INFORMATION THAT HAS YET TO COMMENT ALL OF WHICH IS TO SAY AS WE'RE SITTING HERE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION TODAY WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE BEST DATA ON HAND WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING. TO I BELIEVE IS OFTEN. AT THE PRESS TIME. WHEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT MAYBE THE ASSAULTS WERE IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA WHAT FBI DOES OR WHAT SOME OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DONE. HAS TAKEN A SAMPLING. OF SOME LARGER CITIES WHAT THEY REPORT OUT AND THEN TRIED TO EXTRAPOLATE BASED ON THAT. I DON'T HAVE ANY OPINION AN APARTMENT CERTAINLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY PAIN- ON THAT THE POINT IS JUST THAT WE DON'T HAVE COMPLETE DATA. AND WE DON'T REALLY HAVE COMPLETE DATA AND TELL SOME TIME. ACT AFTER THE DATE IN QUESTION. THANK YOU SO FIRST THE FOLKS THAT MAYBE DIDN'T CATCH THAT SO THE FBI REPORTS. INFORMATION USING UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING. AND THE ONLY DEAL WITH CITIES OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION. WAS A LOT OF CALIFORNIA CITIES THAT HAVE BELOW HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION. JUST THINK ABOUT ALL THE CITIES OF LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND. PEOPLE CITIZENS. NOT CATCHING INFORMATION. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT STATS IN IN CRIME STATS. IT'S KIND OF CUTE BECAUSE YOU LIVING OUT A BIG. THAT CAN pSTATISTICS THAT'S. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER AND- JUST REAL QUICK I KNOW WE'RE WAY OVER TIME FOR THE FIRST PANEL. BUT I. I'M IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO FIND OUT- ESPECIALLY IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. HOW MUCH OF THAT IS MY FACTOR NUMBERS WERE STAGGERING. HOW MUCH OF THE LACK OF REPORTING OR THE LACK OF A REST OR OR CONVICTIONS. OUR WHOLE FOOD RELATED VERSES POLICY THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AND PASSING AT THE SAME TIME. AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS TO BE BOTH COVERT AND THIS POLICY HAPPENING. BUT IF COVERT WASN'T IN EXISTENCE. WITH THE POLICY THAT WE WE'VE BEEN.PUSHING THROUGH IN PASSING. WHAT KIND OF RESULTS WOULD YOU HAVE SUSPECTED- SO MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD GET INFORMATION- FROM EACH OF YOU ON WHAT YOU THINK WAS STRICTLY COVERT RELATED AND I'VE COVERED WASN'T HERE. THAT WITH- DISPARITY WOULD NEVER EXISTED VERSES- POLICY WISE AND WHAT WE'RE FACING. AND HOW WE'RE TRENDY- WITH POLICY I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO HEAR FROM YOU ALL ON THAT. AND WE CAN DO THAT AT A LATER TIME- THANK YOU SO VERY VERY MUCH TO CHAIRMAN- NAVA TO DISTRICT. ATTORNEY VALLEY AND TO MR READING- SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. IT WAS INCREDIBLE- I WOULD LIKE TO NOW INVITE OUR SECOND PANEL- TO THE DYESS. OR REMOTELY JIM JUST MORE QUESTIONS MR READING JERSEYS. ON THE REPORTING REPORT. IN MY ROOM RIGHT A WRONG THE REPORTING NOT MEANT IS. IT IS REPORT YEAH THAT IS IT IS MANDATORY. AND AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT'S MANDATORY THAT THE YES OKAY. THANKS IT'S ACTUALLY MANDATORY GET LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS THE HOSPITALS REQUIRED TO REPORT THE- I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF PEOPLE ARE MANDATED REPORTER FOR. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCORRECT BUT DID DO THE STATS ALWAYS GET THE LESS I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S ON FORSMAN I THINK THAT THAT'S THE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MY HESITATION IS THAT THERE IS- THERE'S LOTS OF DATA. AND SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY THE DATA IS REQUIRED TO BE. REPORTED THAT THERE IS SOME DATA THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED WHEN WE GET INTO MORE SPECIFICS NOT NECESSARILY- BUT AS A GENERAL MATTER THE CITIZENS THAT I PROVIDED TODAY. BOTH COME FROM AUTOMATIC REPORTING SOMEONE SOMEBODY'S BOOKED AND SO THE ECHS DATA'S WHEN SOMEBODY'S BOOKED AND- THAT PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATICALLY COMES TO US. AND THEN THE REMAINING- I HAVE. A RECIPE CALLS AND CONVICTIONS DATA IS REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE WILL NOW INVITE OUR SECOND PANEL TO THE DYESS.

THE PASSION THAT YOU HAVE WE WILL NOW GO TO KALEENA FOWLER IS PRESENT IN PERSON WITH THIS AS A SURVIVOR. HELLO MY NAME IS CLEANER FOWLER AND I'M CURRENTLY A SENIOR AND TENDING COLLEGE PARK HIGH SCHOOL IN PLEASANT HILL WHICH IS IN THE COSTA COUNTY DISTRICT. I AM HONORED TO BE SELECTED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENTS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF PROBE IN NINETEEN ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. I ENJOY ADVOCATING FOR THE COMMUNITY HENCE WHY I AM AN ACTIVE MEMBER IN THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB OF MARTINEZ. AS WELL AS I'M THE PRESIDENT OF MY SCHOOL'S BLACK STUDENT UNION. THE BOX UNION I'VE CREATED CLOSE KNIT COMMUNITY. WITH THE HELP OF MY CLUB LEADERS. WE ADVOCATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE EQUALITY AND EQUITY IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. NOT ONLY HAS THE BOXING UNION. OPEN UP SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME BUT AS HELP ME INSPIRED TO GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY IMMENSELY. IN ADDITION TO THE BOXING IN A MEMBER OF MANY CLUBS SUCH AS BE THE CHANGE IN IRAQ ROTARY AN ENVIRONMENTAL CLUB. FURTHERMORE I AM MY SCHOOL STUDENT BOARD MEMBER. MY DUTIES REPRESENT AND SPEAK ON BEHALF THE STUDENTS AS WELL AS TO MAKE SURE THEIR DESIRES ARE BROUGHT TO LIFE. AFTER HIGH SCHOOL I PLAN TO GO STRAIGHT TO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE AND STUDY POLITICAL SCIENCE PUBLIC POLICY. FOLLOWING LAW SCHOOL. MY ULTIMATE GOAL IN LIFE IS ALWAYS ADVOCATE FOR VOICES IN NEED. I WOULD COVER NINETEEN HAS IMMENSELY IMPACTED THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS- SPECIFICALLY STUDENTS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE PEOPLE'S ARE EITHER EXCELLED IN THIS IS RUNNING FOR COMPLETELY FELL APART. NOT HAVING THE HANDS ON RESOURCES TO GROWN SCHOOL PLUMMETED THE MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS THAT TURNED OUR LIFE UPSIDE DOWN. LEADING TO DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE RATES GOING UP LOSS OF SLEEP AND APPETITE. FEELING ISOLATED ALONE. I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE THE ABILITY OF TIME MANAGEMENT I WAS ABLE TO THRIVE IN THIS AND STARTING. AS WELL AS MY GREAT FAMILY HELPED ME. REGARDING RESOURCES SOME OF MY TEACHERS NOT VERY ACCOMMODATING TO STUDENTS. FOR EXAMPLE GETTING POP QUIZZES NOT BEING ABLE TURN IN LATE WORK. THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY HAVE FOR US. WAS TERRIBLE. ON THE OTHER HAND SO MY TEACHERS RIVER ACCOMMODATING THAT OFFICE HOURS HELP US CALM LET US RETAKE TEST THEY UNDERSTOOD HOW HARD IT WAS IN THIS LIFE OF CHAOS. I BELIEVE THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY REALLY BENEFITTED. THE STUDENTS MORE PACIFIC RESUME I'M NOT SURE HOW WE WOULD HAVE LEARNED WITHOUT ZOOM AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. LEARNING THROUGH SCREEN WAS IMMENSELY DIFFICULT BUT- THE TEACHERS SOME WERE COMING HAVE OFFICE HOURS AND HAVING VISUALS AND POSTING THEIR LECTURES TO LOOK BACK ON WAS VERY. APPRECIATIVE AS ALSO PHONE COMMUNICATIONS WITH FRIENDS I FEEL HELPED TOUCH KEEP US IN TOUCH WITH OUR COMMUNITY. I GAVE US A TOUCH OF THE REAL WORLD WHILE THE- WELL THE ROLE WAS IN CHAOS. I BELIEVE SERVICE PROVIDERS SUCH AS SOON. WE'RE GREAT WE- EXCUSE ME I BELIEVE SERVICE PROVIDERS SUCH AS YOU HAVE AG STRAINS MORE CRISIS BECAUSE DURING THIS TIME. JIM PUBLIC TUTORING- ON ALL MY TEXTBOOKS. ARE MENTAL HEALTH- GREATLY BENEFITED FROM IT THE COMMUNICATION WAS AMAZING. IT PROVIDED US WITH A SENSE OF REALISM. I BELIEVE COUNSELORS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS THERE'S EXTREME SHORTAGE IN MY DISTRICT MY DISTRICT. TEACHERS AND TO BE MORE UNDERSTANDING AND ACCOMMODATING TO STUDENTS UNDERSTAND PLANNING LESSONS MUSEUM. IT'S BEYOND CHALLENGING BY HAVING POP QUIZZES NOT BEING ABLE TRANSLATE WORK AND HAVING FILES IS JUST AND JUST. THE WORK WE'RE DOING DISTANCE LEARNING WAS TREMENDOUS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANY STUDENTS TO KEEP UP WITH INCLUDING MYSELF. I BELIEVE THE BARRIERS THOUGHT- EXISTED BUT LIMITED OUR EFFORTS TO SUPPORT SURVIVORS FOR COMMUNICATION. COMMUNICATION IS KEY WHEN SUPPORTING SURVIVORS AND THE BEST WAY TO REACH OUT STUDENTS AND MY DISTRICT WE DO A LOT OF RESOURCES BUT LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT EDUCATED ABOUT THEM. FOR INSTANCE OUR SCHOOL ID CARDS DO YOU HAVE THE- THEY DO OF THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE. THE DISTRICT HEALTH SERVICE USE OUR HOTLINE AND THE CRISIS HOTLINE. AS WELL SOCIAL MEDIA IS A GREAT WAY TO SPREAD THE INFORMATION FOR THOSE IN NEED. I'VE DONE MY RESURGENT ON INSTAGRAM THERE ARE SOME ACCOUNTS SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH AMERICA LET'S TALK MENTAL HEALTH IN ADVOCATING FOR MENTAL HEALTH. AS WELL AS WATER THE PSYCH CENTRAL RETHINK AND NONSTICK MONTHS. I WE SOCIAL MEDIA REALLY HELP STUDENTS IN NEED. IT WAS A SENSE THAT WE'RE ALL THERE AND CONNECTED GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING AND I WAS REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IT. DURING THIS TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU POLLINA VALOR AND NEXT WE HAVE WILLIAM BUT SOME BURKE SURVIVOR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR GRAYSON AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE MY NAME IS WILLIAM WATSON BURKE I'M A PROUD RESIDENT OF TRACY AND A FORMER CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATE- COUNCILMEMBER CANDIDATE AND A PROUD KOREAN AMERICAN. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ORGANIZING THIS HEARING AND ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS MYSELF TO SPEAK ON THE INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND HOW IT'S IMPACTED US. WHEN THE WORLD SHUT DOWN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO TO COVER NINETEEN. NEVER COULD I HAVE IMAGINED THE HATE AND VITRIOL THAT WOULD BE DIRECTED ASIAN AMERICANS. IT SEEMS LIKE DAY AFTER DAY YOU SEE ON TWITTER. TICK TOCK. INSTAGRAM AND CABLE TELEVISION STORIES OF PEOPLE OF ASIAN DESCENT BEING ATTACKED. THEY WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING THEY WERE HURTING ANYONE. BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP INDIVIDUALS FROM BELIEVING THAT THEY HAD A RIGHT TO HURT THEM. EARLIER THIS YEAR I WITNESSED A VIDEO OF AN ELDERLY CHINESE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN ATTACKED IN SAN FRANCISCO. SHOULD A LARGE PURPLE BRUISE OVER HER EYE AND WAS CRYING WHILE HER ASSAILANT WAS RECEIVING MERIT MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE CRIES I HEARD IN THE VIDEO STRUCK ME. I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF MY GRANDMOTHER A KOREAN AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS AND NOW IN OUR EIGHTIES AND I COULDN'T BEAR IMAGINING HER WALKING DOWN THE STREET OR COMING OUT OF CHURCH TO BE ATTACKS SIMPLY BECAUSE SOMEONE SOCCER ASIAN FEATURES. WHEN THE SHOOTING IN ATLANTA HI. WHEN THE SHOOTING IN THE ATLANTASUBURBS HAPPENED I AGAIN HAD A SIMILAR RESPONSE THIS TIME I THOUGHT OF MY MOM. THOSE THE ONES WITH THE SHOOTINGS OCCURRED LEVINE OR OPERATED BY WOMEN OF ASIAN DESCENT. WHO KNOWS OF ANOTHER SHOOTING OR ANOTHER ATTACK COULD OCCUR IN SIMILAR LOCATIONS. AT AN ASIAN SUPERMARKET. AT AN ASIAN RESTAURANT. TO HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE COULD HAPPEN TO MY FAMILY OR MYSELF. SIMPLY BECAUSE WE LOOK DIFFERENT OR THAT WE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH OF IN NINETEEN. IS DRAMATIC. IN THE WAKE OF THAT SHOOTING I HELPED ORGANIZE A VIGIL WITH FELLOW ADVOCATES IN MY HOMETOWN OF TRACY. TO RECOGNIZE THE VIOLENCE BEING PERPETRATED AGAINST PEOPLE OF ASIAN DESCENT. WE HAD A SHOWING OF NEARLY FIFTY PEOPLE AND PUTTING SOME OF OUR MEMBERS OF OUR CITY COUNCIL INTENDED. TO SHOW THAT WE WOULD STAND UP TO ACCESS. THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE. AND THEN WE ALSO SAW THE SHOOTING AT THE BEAUTY CENTER IN SAN JOSE. WHERE THE WHERE TO RESIDENTS OF SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY LOST THEIR LIVES. INCLUDING A SICK MAN FROM TRACY. WELL THE VCA INCIDENT MAY NOT BE CLASSIFIED A HATE CRIME WHEN I HEARD THIS. ME AND MANY OTHERS IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF WHEN A SICK MAN WAS MURDERED IN TRACY I ONE OF OUR PARKS TWO YEARS AGO. I CAME OUT TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY MOURNING THE LOSS OF ONE OF OUR OWN AND HEARD FROM LEADERS. FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS TO COMMUNITY LEADERS ON THE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THE RISING VIOLENCE. THE TROUBLE WE FACE AS INDIVIDUALS AS A RESULT OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE. IS ALSO FELT AS A COMMUNITY. WE LIVE IN A CONNECTED WORLD WHERE WE SEE AND EXPERIENCE WHAT OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILIES AND EVEN STRANGERS SHARE. WE NO LONGER CAN IGNORE THAT THE WORLD IS IN SILENT. BUT WHEN AND THAT THE TRAUMA ONE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES IN ONE PART OF THE WORLD CANNOT RICOCHET AND TSUNAMI IN TOMORROW. WE HAVE BEEN ILLIQUID TO HANDLE THE IMPACTS THESE DRAMATIC EVENTS HAVE ON US. WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON HOW TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN THESE EVENTS. BUT EVEN AFTER YOU TURN EIGHTEEN DRAMATIC EVENTS STILL IMPACT US. AT THE VIGIL HONORING THE LIVES OF THE SENATE THEY SHOOTING. WE HAD ELECTED OFFICIALS COME UP AND SPEAK ON HOW THESE INCIDENTS NEED TO STOP. BUT I BELIEVE THERE WAS AN ABSENCE IN THE RESOURCES WE CAN TURN TO HANDLE HOW WE FEEL AND HOW THESE EVENTS IMPACT US. ESPECIALLY IN THIS WORLD IMPACTED BY COVE IN NINETEEN. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE STARTING ON HOW INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE AFFECTS US AND OUR COMMUNITIES. ALL THE TESTIMONY HERE TODAY REFLECTS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE LIKE ME WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY WHAT WE'VE WITNESSED AND EXPERIENCED. AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE CAN STREAMLINE AND MAKE IT EASIER TO ACCESS RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN HEAL FROM THESE WOUNDS. OR MENTAL HEALTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BURKE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO NOW HEAR FROM THE CENTER DIRECTOR. FOR THE CENTRAL CONTRA COSTA COUNTY FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER BADLY ONLY. HELLO MY NAME. HOW YOU DOING. I'M DOING MY NAME IS NOT ILLEGALLY S. I AM THE CENTRAL CENTER DIRECTOR FOR THE CONTRA COSTA FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER. THE FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER IS A ONE STOP CENTER FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT CHILD ABUSE ELDER ABUSE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. I'D LIKE YOU. TO IMAGINE SOMETHING WITH ME. IMAGINE A WOMAN NAMED HANNAH AND HAS TWO CHILDREN AND SHE LIVES WITH HER BOYFRIEND IN A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT. IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. AND IT WORKS AT A LOCAL RESTAURANT MAKING MINIMUM WAGE AND HER BOYFRIEND FREDDIE IS UNEMPLOYED THEY HAVE ADDED A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP HISTORY BUT I'VE NEVER GOTTEN INTO ANY PHYSICAL ALTERCATIONS. CAN YOU IMAGINE THEM. NOW IT'S MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AND THE PANDEMIC HITS AND EVERYTHING SHUTS DOWN THE RESTAURANT WHERE HANNAH IS WORKING THE SCHOOL WHERE THE KIDS GO EVERYTHING OVER THE COURSE OF THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF THE SHELTER IN PLACE AND I'M FRED GET INCREASINGLY MORE STRESSED SHE ISN'T WORKING FOR IT ISN'T WORKING THE KIDS ARE AT HOME ALL THE TIME GOING TO SCHOOL. ONZM ALL IN THEIR TINY APARTMENT IN FROM THE STRESS OF THE SITUATION FRED BECOMES PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE TOWARDS YEAH. IN AN EARLY THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES ARE WITNESSING THIS ABUSE BECAUSE THEIR HOME ALL THE TIME. IN EARLY APRIL AND IT DECIDES THAT IT'S NO LONGER SAFE FOR HER OR HER CHILDREN TO REMAIN IN THE HOME. AND SHE TRIES TO REACH OUT TO THE COURT TO FILE A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER. BUT THE COURT IS SHUT DOWN TO THE PUBLIC SHE CAN'T GET A HOLD OF ANYONE. SHE TRIED CALLING A FEW OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO MEET IN A SAFE PLACE WITHIN ADVOCATE. BUT MOST SERVICES ARE BEING OFFERED REMOTELY AND SHE DOES NOT HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO HAVE A PHONE CONVERSATION. CANISTER DURATION SEEMS HOPELESS WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT THE CONTRA COSTA FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER MADE THE DECISION TO REMAIN OPEN TO THE PUBLIC FOR CLIENTS LIKE ANNA. THE PANDEMIC EXACERBATED THE VIEWS HANNAH WAS EXPERIENCING AND IT MADE IT MORE CHALLENGING FOR HER TO ACCESS RESOURCES. OFFICIALS WERE TELLING THE COMMUNITY TO SHELTER IN PLACE BUT HOW CAN YOU DO THAT IF YOUR HOME IS NOT A SAFE PLACE. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS CONTRA COSTA FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER HAS GROWN TO THREE LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT CONTRA COSTA AND IS PARTNERED WITH OVER SIXTY ORGANIZATIONS. AND THAT'S THE KEY TO GETTING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC IN GETTING SURVIVORS THE HELP THEY NEED COLLABORATION BETWEEN COMMUNITY AGENCIES. A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WERE ALL INVOLVED AB ONE GOAL. REDUCING INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE. HOLDEN HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BOTH OUR CLIENTS AND THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEM IN TWENTY TWENTY THE FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER SO ON INCREASE OF CLIENTS BY 14% WE ALSO SAW AN INCREASE IN THE SEVERITY OF THE ABUSE THEY WERE EXPERIENCING. CHILDREN AND MAKE UNDER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. OVER CRITICAL NEEDS THAT WE SAW DURING THE PANDEMIC FROM OUR CLIENTS RESTRAINING ORDER ASSISTANCE MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELLING SUPPORT AND HOUSING AND IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AYE LAWYERS FOR FAMILY JUSTICE PROGRAM HASASSISTED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY BRIAN'S WITH RESTRAINING ORDERS WE'VE CONNECTED SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE CLIENTS MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. AGENCIES WORKING WITH SURVIVORS NEED TO THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO RUN PROGRAMS UCH AS THESE THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF SURVIVORS THANKS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TIM GRAYSON EFFORTS FAMILY JUSTICE CENTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WILL BE RECEIVING A MUCH NEEDED FUNDING NEXT YEAR TO SUPPORT THESE ONGOING PROGRAMS. PANDEMIC HAS IMPACTED IN A PERSONAL BUYERS SURVIVORS IN THE WAY WE COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED. WE MUST REMEMBER THE INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. WHEN VIOLENCE HAPPENS IN THE HOME IT IMPACTS ALL SECTORS HEALTHCARE AGENCIES THE LEGAL SYSTEM EDUCATION. IS CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AGENCIES THAT SERVE INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE SURVIVORS THROUGH FUNDING AND ADVOCACY MEASURES I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE WITH INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE SURVIVORS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. AND I HOPE TO COLLABORATE MORE CLOSELY IN THE FUTURE WITH OUR STATE REPRESENTATIVES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. NOT NEARLY AS THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE WILL NOW GO TO JOANNA RUSS'S PROJECT SISTER FAMILY SERVICES. HELLO EVERYONE MY NAME IS JOHN A ROAST US IN NINE HOTLINE START. UP PROJECTS INSTAGRAM SERVICES. WE ARE LOCAL RAPE CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA MISTER PART OF ELLIE AND SAM REGIONAL COUNTY. A MAJORITY OF THIS MISTER COME ONE OF ALL AND WE'RE COMMUNITIES THAT INCLUDES ALL CHILDREN WANT. UNDOCUMENTED SURVIVORS LGBTQ RIGHTS MR. ALL HAD A DIFFICULT TIME. FOR IT TO WORK DISCLOSE THAT THEY HAVE SO. BUT BECAUSE OF COMMON. HADN'T EVEN MORE TO TIME. ORDING AND ACCESS RESOURCES AND IS JOHN TIMES. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT PRO MR BROWN'S. HAS STOPPED PROVIDING PERSON TO SUPPORT SURVIVORS ONE REPORTING TO LINE. WHEN GOING TO COURT. WHEN TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF MEDICAL WORK FOR. NOT ONLY THAT BUT OUR OUTREACH DEPARTMENT HAS FOUND WAYS TO PROVIDE PRESENTATIONS ON SEXUAL ASSAULT RESOURCES TO THE COMMUNITY EVEN THROUGHOUT CORPORATE NINETEEN. WE HAVE HAD CAMPUS ADVOCATE WHO HAS STILL PROVIDE SERVICES WITH STUDENT SURVIVORS AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE SURVIVORS MARC NEEDY. ARE BEING HEARD AND ARE BEING SUPPORTED. BECAUSE OF COMMON NINETEEN WE HAVE SEEN A DECREASE OF VOLUNTEER ADVOCATES. BUT WE STILL HAVE SEEN INCREASED NEED FOR ADVOCATES IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE HAVE TEAMED UP WITH FRIENDS NURSE SPECIALIST TO RESPOND TO CASES ON FOR THE SUPPORT INCREASING SUPPORT FOR SURVIVORS DURING THE FRIENDS OF MEDICAL EXAM HAVING ADVOCATE DURING THE FRIENDS GOAL MEDICAL EXAM IS CRUCIAL IT'S THE FIRST STEP IN HEALING. AND HAVING ADVOCATE THERE TO HELP. GUIDE A SURVIVOR IS ESSENTIAL. OTHER CHALLENGES WE HAVE SEEN OUR DURING THE COLD NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ARE WHAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER HELPING SURVIVORS. IN RESTRAINING ORDERS. OUT THE NEW FOR PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS DURING COVERT NINETEEN SO MANY SURVIVORS GO OUT WITH RESTRAINING ORDERS BECAUSE THE PROCESS JUST TO COMPLICATED. MORE COMPLICATED THAN USUAL. NOT ONLY THAT ARE SURVIVORS HAVE ALSO HAD A DIFFICULT TIME IN AXIS OF THE COMPENSATION THE COMPENSATION WAS CRUCIAL IN GETTING THE ONES THAT THEY NEED IN A TIMELY MANNER TO BE LUCKY. TO HAVE OUR SAFETY. OUR CAMERAS THEIR HOME AND OTHER NEEDS IS JUST AND- NINETEEN SURVIVORS HAD TO AND WHAT DID TIME. NOW MORE THAN EVER SOME FOR BIG. AND SUPPORTERS ISN'T. AS WE SEE THESE NUMBERS. AND SEEN SURVIVORS BASICALLY COMPORT AND START RECORDING AGAIN KEEPS THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO AYE ROSES FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND I THINK WE HEARD SOMETHING OF A VERY A THEME THROUGHOUT AND THAT WAS THAT TECHNOLOGY PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE. IN PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO MAKE A CONNECTION- HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW AND HAVE EXPERIENCE THIS THAT THAT- IN PERSON CANNOT BE REPLACED. AND THERE'S SOMETHING THERE'S A DYNAMIC THAT COMES WITH IN PERSON WHETHER IT'S A MEDICAL EXAM AND HAVING AN ADVOCATE PRESENT OR WHETHER IT'S THAT AND MISSIONAL ENGAGEMENT OR CONTACT TO- TO PROVIDE SERVICES. THAT IN PERSON- ENGAGEMENT OF CONTACT IS IRREPLACEABLE SO I'M GLAD FOR THE TELEHEALTH I'M GLAD FOR REMOTE ACCESS HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME ASPECTS OF IN PERSON THAT JUST CANNOT BE REPLACED SO WITH THAT. WELL EITHER JOANNA WHAT VERY. CURRENTLY EXIST THAT LIMIT OR IMPEDE YOUR EFFORTS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT- TO VICTIMS OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE OR INTIMATE. PARTNER VIOLENCE AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUALS WHO EXPERIENCE IPV TO REACH OUT. AND JOANNA OR OR NATALIE EITHER ONE OF YOU. YES SURE SO OF PERSONALLY I HAVE SEEN THAT SURVIVORS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BASIC NEEDS LIKE. THEY DON'T HAVE A LAPTOP I OFTENTIMES ONE ON SOON TO SHOW THEM HOW TO- FIVE GREAT THINGS LIKE. COMPENSATION HOUSING RESOURCES THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE BASIC NEEDS RIGHT WHY FIGHT- COMPUTERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT I'M STILL. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT JUST INNOVATIVE WAYS OF MEETING WITH SURVIVORS WHILE STILL MEETING- OPENING TEAM SAFETY PROCEDURES IN PLACE HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE BUT I THINK AGENCIES LIKE PROJECTS AND STERN OTHERS ARE REALLY COMING TOGETHER TO FIND OUT HOW TO BRIDGE. THOSE GAPS AND SUPPORT SURVIVORS. THANK YOU. MADLY YEAH I'M NOT I WOULD SAY THERE WERE A COUPLE THINGS THAT HAVE REALLY IMPUTED IN BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT SURVIVORS DURING THE PANDEMIC IT'S A LITTLE LESS SO NOW BUT I THINK ONE MAJOR WHICH WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT IS ESPECIALLY IF YOU RUN A NONPROFIT IS FUNDING RIGHT. ALL THE FUNDING THAT KIND OF STOPPED WE HAD SOME LOCAL FUNDS THAT YOU CAN KINDA COLLECTOR S. RIGHT THERE WERE SOME ACTION NEED FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NOT RECEIVING STIMULUS TRACKS TO BE ABLE TO PAY RENT- THERE WAS WHEN THE COURT SHUT DOWN OUR COURT SYSTEM ISN'T ONLINE YET AND SO THEY HAD TO KIND OF SCRAMBLE TO CREATE A WAITED. FILE RESTRAINING ORDERS WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE THE PUBLIC COME IN PERSON SO THERE WERE SEVERAL DIFFERENT ASPECTS SYSTEM WIDE THAT NEED TO BE LOOKING AT LOOKED AT IN ORDER TO TRY AND MAKE REMOTE- SERVICES EASIER TO ACCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS BUT AGAIN I THINK THE ONE THING THAT WAS ESSENTIAL IS THAT DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND COUNTY AGENCIES LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTINUE TO CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER TO GET UPDATES ON WHAT WAS GOING ON- AND I THINK THAT HAD THE MOST IMPACT IN TRYING TO CONNECT SURVIVORS TO RESOURCE JUST BECAUSE- IF WE ALL HAVE THE SAME MESSAGING OF. YOU CAN STILL REACH OUT TO US REGARDLESS OF WHAT AGENCY YOU YOU CONNECT WITH THAT'S THE CHEAP YOU'RE GETTING THE SAME MESSAGING AND THEN SOME MORE SURVIVORS ARE GONNA BE. ABLE TO KNOW THEIR SUPPORT SERVICES. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND I DO WANT TO THANK MISTER HILL MISS VALOR. MISTER MUTTS AND BERG FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORIES AS WELL AS MISCELLANEOUS AND MISS ROSES FOR YOUR AMAZING SUPPORT- THAT YOU AND YOUR ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE EVERY DAY TO SURVIVORS. OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE AND FOR PROVIDING TESTIMONY AT TODAY'S HEARING I DO WANT TO TRY TO OUR OUR THIRD AND FINAL PANEL- JANET SAID LEAGUE COMMISSIONER AN INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE OF THE SUB COMMITTEE CHAIRED. LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION VANESSA RUSSELL FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR LOVE NEVER FAILS. MONICA WILSON MAYOR PRO TEM CITY OF ANTIOCH. CHRISTIAN COLON PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND TINA ROSE AULUS POLICY ADVOCATE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY.

ONE THAT IS IN PERSON. AND SO WE WILL AGAIN THIS PANEL WILL EXPLORE STRATEGIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS GIVEN BY THE RISE OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE DURING THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND WE WILL HAVE COMMISSIONER SAID LEE BEGAN. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN- MY NAME AGAIN IS JOANNE ASSEMBLY I AM THE CHAIR OF THE LITTLE HARD WORK AT LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION INTERNET PARTNER VIOLENCE. COMMITTEE FIRST I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO HAS APPEARED AT THE HEARING- WITH US TODAY I THINK THE TESTIMONY HAS BEEN INVALUABLE AND VERY HELPFUL AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO TRY TO ADDRESS ANY OF THESE ISSUES. SO- WITH THAT I ALSO- AS STATED BY CHAIRMAN ALTHOUGH WHO- TESTIFIED ON YOUR FIRST HAND ALL. THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING EIGHT OPERATIONS AND MAKING OF THE- RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS. OF STATE GOVERNMENT. MISSION ISSUE TO WORK AND PAST YEAR AND- THIS FIRST TO IN PARTNER VIOLENCE. TRAGICALLY THIS IMPORTANT TO BE USED IT CALLED IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS. THIRD OF WOMEN AT A CORNER OF MEN IN CALIFORNIA WILL EXPERIENCE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE IN THEIR LIFETIME WE CAN'T EVEN HIGHER FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THOSE WHO ARE TRANSGENDER. STATE BANK OF THIS HORRIFIC VIOLENCE ALL OF IT GOES FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. IN OUR REPORT BE ON THE CRISIS A LONG TERM APPROACH TO REDUCE PREVENT AND RECOVER FROM INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. WE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL BARRIERS THAT PREVENT HELP FROM REACHING INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED BY THIS HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE. FIRST CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE TO INTIMATE PARTNER PARTNER VIOLENCE IS MINISTERED FRAGMENTOS. THERE ARE DOZENS OF STATE AGENCIES THAT ADDRESSES VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS CRISIS BUT THERE IS NO SINGLEAGENCY NOR SINGLE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS OR LACK THEREOF ON REDUCING OR PREVENTING THIS TYPE OF CRIME. THIS SILO APPROACH CREATES CRITICAL GAPS IN THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO PREVENT THAT THE B. S. AND THE BIGGEST PAY A PRICE. THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY OUR GREATEST INTERVENTION WHICH MEANS HELP IS OFTEN TOO LATE. OR TOO LITTLE. EXISTING REHABILITATION PROGRAMS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO EVERYBODY. BATTERER INTERVENTION PROGRAMS WERE CONVICTED ABUSERS MUST PARTICIPATE AS A CONDITION OF PROBATION ARE NOT ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE NOR ARE THEY DIVERSE. WE'VE BEEN RURAL AREAS WHERE SPEAK LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH YOU KNOW I HAVE MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO FIND SUITABLE PROGRAMS. AND NO TAXPAYER FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR THESE PROGRAMS. THE REQUIRED TO PAY APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED DOLLARS OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER PROGRAM DEPENDING ON THEIR INCOME SLIDING SCALE. THOSE WHO CANNOT PAY TOO MANY CLASSES ARE OFTEN RE ARRESTED AND SPENT TEN TO THIRTY DAYS IN JAIL FOR VIOLATING PROBATION OFTEN LOSING THEIR JOBS AND ACCRUING EVEN MORE FINE AND MORE DEBT IN THIS PROCESS. THIRD CALIFORNIA'S GOT ALONG. WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO DO A MEDIUM WE REMOVE FIREARMS FROM ABUSE FROM ABUSERS. LACKING FOR SMITH. DECADES OLD USED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO TRACK INDIVIDUALS PROHIBITED FROM YOU OWNING GUNS ARE UNABLE TO AUTOMATICALLY CROSS REFERENCE EACH OTHER AN OLDER AGENT INTERNATIONAL PHONE- SO MAY NO LONGER BE ELIGIBLE. VOTER WEAPON. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE DOJ FACES A CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF SPECIAL AGENTS TO CARRY OUT WHAT IS VERY VERY DANGEROUS WORK OF LOCATING AND RETRIEVING THESE WEAPONS. IT IS A LOT OF THEIR STATE A WOMAN IS FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE KILLED BY AN ABUSIVE PARTNER. IF THAT GENTLEMAN HAD ACCESS TO FIREARMS. THAT IS NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE. LASLEY A LACK OF LONG TERM SUPPORT FIRST MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ESTABLISH A LIFE ON THEIR OWN. ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE IS THE KEY FOR SURVIVORS TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY LEAVE AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP BUT SADLY MANY COULD NOT AFFORD TO STAY AWAY FROM THEIR ABUSER. SURVIVORS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR OWN BANK ACCOUNTS OR VITAL DOCUMENTS THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO TRAVEL FOR SECURITY JOB HOUSING OR FINANCIAL AID. CURRENTLY STATE RESOURCES ARE NOT AS HELPFUL TO SURVIVORS AS THEY SHOULD BE WELL THE VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD REIMBURSES CRIME VICTIMS FOR DIRECTING THE DENNIS EXPENSES RELATED TO THIS CRISIS MANY SURVIVORS DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO PAY FIRST FOR THE SERVICES. AND WAIT. UNTIL THEY CAN BE REIMBURSED. AN EMERGENCY A- WELCOME. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO HELP SURVIVORS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE ACHIEVE LONG TERM STABILITY. SURVIVORS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE CAN BE BETTER HELP IF CALIFORNIA ACTS NOW JUST OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS. IN THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION'S REPORT. THAT OUTLINED KEY STEPS THAT THE STATE CAN TAKE COULD YOU JEFF THAT. CALIFORNIA MUST FIRST BE TRANSFORMED ITS RESPONSE TO INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE FROM A FOCUS ON CRISIS INTERVENTION IS TO ONE OF PREVENTION. AND EARLY INTERVENTION. WELL CRISIS IS A CRITICAL ASPECT OF RESPONDING TO INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. IT COULD NOT. PURSUED IT ALONE. THE STATEMENT ALSO FOCUS ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES TO MAKE TO MAKE AVAILABLE HELP AVAILABLE FOR THE CRISIS ARRIVED. FURTHER THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE MUST APPOINT A LEADER WHO ILL NOT ONLY ONLY ISSUE AREA ADVANCEMENT PARTNER VIOLENCE BUT WILL ALSO STEER THE STATE TOWARDS A NEW APPROACH. THE LEGISLATURE MUST ALSO ENSURE THE CREATION AND FUNDING OF PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM IS INITIATIVE SHOULD BE INCLUDED AND ALL APPLICABLE STATEWIDE STRATEGIC PLANS RANGING FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION YOUR REDUCING. HOMELESSNESS EXISTING WAY OF. PRO THAT BETTER URBAN PROGRAMS SHOULD BE A- ON WHETHER THEY ARE ACTUALLY. REHABILITATION OR NOT. YEAH THE LEGISLATURE MUST ENFORCE THE STATE'S FIREARMS LAWS- SPEEDING UP BY G. MODERNIZATION AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND BOLSTERING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF SPECIAL AGENT. WILL HELP TOWARDS THIS REALITY. FINALLY RESOURCES THAT HELP SURVIVORS ESTABLISH FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE MUST BE EXPANDED AND PROMOTED THIS INCLUDES CREATING A ONE STOP SHOP WHERE SURVIVORS CAN RECEIVE COPIES OF THEIR VITAL RECORDS AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON HOW TO RECOVER- AND THAT RECOVER AND PREVENT IDENTITY BACK. TRANSITIONING THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD MODEL FROM A STATE FUNDED ONE OF REIMBURSEMENT SO REAL TIME PAYMENTS WILL BE VERY HELPFUL AND- ADVERTISING HOUSING ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE TO SURVIVORS- TO SURVIVORS MORE FULLY AND EJECTING THAT FLEXIBLE- TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE TWO SURVIVORS NEEDS ALL THE HELP TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ONCE IMPLEMENTED WILL HELP CALIFORNIA TO CREATE A MORE HOLISTIC STRATEGIC AND COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO COMBAT INTERNET PARTNER VIOLENCE AND HELPING SURVIVORS THEREBY THE SURVIVING. ON THEIR OWN. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU DO YOU THANK YOU JEFF SAID LEE AND WILL NOW GO TO VANESSA. FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR LOVE NEVER FAILS. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR FOR A CHAIRMAN GRAYSON AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER AND THE YELLOW HIGH COURT LEADERSHIP TEAM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- I AM THE FOUNDER OF LOVE NEVER FAILS AN ANTI TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR TEN YEARS. I WE PROVIDED HOUSING FOR A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO WOMEN MEN AND CHILDREN AND WE ALSO HAVE A STATE CERTIFIED CYBERSECURITY AND NETWORKING PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS AND OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS- DURING THE PANDEMIC WE TRAINED OVER THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS- USING OUR I. T. CURRICULUM. AND OUR STUDENTS ARE 56% WOMEN AND ALSO MENTION I'M ALSO THE CO CHAIR OF OAKLAND'S VIOLENCE PREVENTION COALITION GENDER BASED VIOLENCE COMMITTEE. AND ALSO A PROFESSOR ANDREFERRAL TO COLLEGES IN OAKLAND AND VERY ADAMANT ABOUT WORKING WITH. VICTIMS OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE GENDER BASED VIOLENCE AND PROVIDING THEM ACCESS TO SUSTAINABLE CAREERS IN THE IT WORLD. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LACK OF HOUSING SUSTAINABLE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES ARE THE GREATEST BARRIERS THAT WE HAVE AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED- THAT TO OVER COMMON PREVENT. AND INTERVENE IN THE LIVES OF. HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS AND- A QUICK STORY IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY I RECEIVED A CALL FROM VALLEJO PD AND LETTING ME KNOW THAT THEY HAD A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD IT WAS A RAINY NIGHT AND SUNDAY NIGHT. MIDNIGHT ARE THEY HAD A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO TAKE HER ON SHE HAD BEEN TRAFFICKED OUT OF CARS. AND FOR SIX MONTHS AND THERE SHE WAS AND NEEDED SOMEWHERE TO GO. I WENT TO GO PICK HER UP. AND AND I STARTED CALLING AROUND TO MY CONTACTS DURING THE THIS IS YOUR AGAIN MAY TWENTY TWENTY IN THE MIDDLE THE PANDEMIC. STARTED CALLING THE PLACES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE CHILDREN AND THAT I HAD LOOKED TO FOR AS FOR PARTNER HAS ME AS A PARTNER IN THIS DIFFICULT SITUATION. AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAD ALL CLOSED. AND SO I FOUND MYSELF IN A REALLY ON A HARD PLACE. FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. AND ALSO WITH THE YOUTH SHELTER IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND THEY WERE ABLE TO HOUSE HER FOR NINETY DAYS. USUALLY IT'S A TWENTY ONE DAY HOLD BUT I'M FOR YOUTH AND HOMELESS YOUTH BUT IT HAD BEEN EXTENDED TO NINETY DAYS DURING THAT THE CAN DAMAGE. AS I LOOKED AROUND- JUST AROUND THE STATE. AFTER THAT WE REPLACED HER I. WAS LOOKING FOR PLACES THAT SHE COULD GO THAT WEREN'T LONG TERM AND AGAIN COULD NOT FIND ANY PLACES FOR TRAFFICKED GIRL TO GO. AND THAT WAS THAN WE WERE WHEN WE MADE THE PLANS TO OPEN OUR HOME. IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY FOR GIRLS AGES THIRTEEN TO SEVENTEEN- AND THIS PLACE THIS HOME THAT WE'VE OPENED. A WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HOUSE FIVE GIRLS AND PROVIDE THEM SAFETY. AND A PLACE FOR HEALING AND ALSO A PLACE WHERE THEIR PARENTS CAN RECEIVE COUNSELING AND REUNIFICATION SUPPORT- AND THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS- WE HAVE NOTICED A AN EXTREME SHORTAGE OF HOUSING FOR ADULTS. FOR WOMEN I'M FOR- LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR MEN AND FOR GIRLS AND FOR BOYS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY. A GENDER BASED VIOLENCE IMPACTED BY HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND THIS GIRL WAS JUST ONE OF MANY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED PERHAPS RIGHT BACK OUT ON THE STREET IF A PARENT DIDN'T PICK THEM UP. OR PERHAPS MAYBE A PARENT WOULD CALM BUT A PARENT WHO WAS LIVING IN CAR POVERTY APPARENTLY WAS TRAUMATIZED APPARENTLY WAS ILL EQUIPPED. TO DEAL WITH THE CHILD HAD BEEN SEXUALLY TRAUMATIZED IN THAT WAY. AND SO. WE BELIEVE AGAINST THEM EARLY IN OUR XIN ISN'T MUCH NEEDED- AT AS WE GO FOR. AND LOOK AT THE IMPACTS OF THINGS LIKE THE PANDEMIC AND JUST IN GENERAL. FINDING WAYS TO HOUSE TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. FOR THESE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IS KEY TO PREVENTING. THE EXTENSION OF A GENDER BASED VIOLENCE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT- VERY QUICKLY I WANT TO THANK BOTH CHAIR PERSON- GRAYSON AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER FOR YOUR ABSTAINED. AND OR OPPOSE BOTH FOR THE SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN WHICH IS AN ATTEMPT TO DECRIMINALIZE LOITERING FOR PROSTITUTION ACROSS THE STATE. I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU'RE LISTENING TO SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHO ARE SAYING. THAT LEGISLATION LIKE THIS- THAT IS SEEMS TO BE A POSITIVE THING FOR VICTIMS- IS ACTUALLY. GOING TO BE QUITE DETRIMENTAL TO THEM- BECAUSE ON ONE HAND SURVIVORS WANT TO SEE THE DECRIMINALIZATION. OF HIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING- AND BECAUSE THEY ARE VICTIMS THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CRIMINALIZED BUT- BILLS LIKE THIS TO DECRIMINALIZE IT THE CRIME FOR BUYERS. AND FOR EXPLOITERS AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE VERY ADAMANT ABOUT I'M KIND OF ADVOCATING AGAINST WE ALSO WANT TO SEE. BILLS LIKE THIS COM COUPLED WITH NOT PROVIDING SERVICES LIKE THE HOUSING LIKE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES LIKE THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES THAT. THAT WE OFFER AND MANY OTHER NONPROFITS IN ADVOCATES OFFER WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE OFFERED AS- AS- REASONABLE EXIT SERVICES. FROM HUMAN TRAFFICKING- IF THERE'S EVEN A POSITION OF REMOVING LAW ENFORCEMENT OR REMOVING THE CURRENT PROTECTION AND GATES THAT ARE IN PLACE. THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE PUT IN PLACE AND SO VERY ADAMANT THAT- AS WE LOOK AT NOT ONLY THE- SERVICES LANDSCAPE BUT WE LOOK AT THE POLITICAL. AND POLICY LANDSCAPE THAT WE KEEP THE SURVIVOR VOICE. FRONT. AND CENTER AND I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU HAD SOME VIRUS ON EARLIER TODAY PRIORITIZING THEIR FOR. THEIR THEIR NEEDS AND- LASTLY I WILL SAY THAT DURING THE PAN TAPE BAND TO MAKE WE HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK IN THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY. FOR EXPLOITING CHILDREN- I BELIEVE I HEARD DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY SITE THAT THERE WERE YOU KNOW ELEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE ADDS THAT SHE WHERE SHE AN- ENTERTAINMENT AND SERVE THAT 70% OF WHOM WERE UP OR UP ADS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY. WE KNOW THAT- TECHNOLOGY IS BEING USED IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY AS WITH- HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER TO- CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN SAFETY PRECAUTIONS PUT IN PLACE WITH TECHNOLOGY- SUCH AS- WHAT WE'RE SEEING COMING UP HERE VERY QUICKLY WITH THE ONLY FANS- ONLINE PLATFORM WHICH IS BEING USED TO TRAFFIC CHILDREN. AND VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS THAT THOSE TYPES OF A- PLATFORMS BE CAREFULLY MONITORED AND CAREFULLY- CAREFULLY MANAGED AND- AND THAT. THE ONLINE WORLD AS WE BRING MORE CHILDREN ON TO THE ONLINE WORLD AND WE BRING MORE VULNERABLE PEOPLE ON THERE THAT THEY'RE NOT PREYED UPON THAT THEY HAVE THE PROPER TRAINING AND THAT THERE IS A PROPER. SAFETY PROTOCOLS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DIGITAL WORLD IS A SAFE PLACE FOR THEM AS WELL SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF SURVIVORS. AND- THANKS FOR THIS FOR THIS TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY VANESSA RUSSELL AND WE WILL NOW. GO TO SENATE OR TO- MONICA WILSON MAYOR PRO TEM. FOR CITY OF ANTIOCH. YES THANK YOU CHAIRPERSON GRAYSON- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION- THIS AFTERNOON AFTER THAT ACTUALLY THIS MORNING SO I'M GONNA KEEP MY COMMENTS. BRIEF BECAUSE A LOT OF IT IS REPETITIVE BUT I'M I'M JUST GONNA GET STRAIGHT O THE POINT. MY NAME IS MONICA WILSON AND I'M THE MAYOR PRO TEM OF ONE OF THE LARGEST ONE OF THE LARGEST CITIES IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. THE CITY OF ANTIOCH. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPACE TO TESTIFY AND PROVIDE A VOICE FOR THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT FEEL THAT THEY ARE NOT HEARD. BY BEING HERE TODAY WE'RE LETTING SURVIVORS KNOW THAT THEY THAT THEY MATTER AND THAT THEY ARE NOT ALONE. THROUGHOUT MY CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE I'VE DEVOTED MYSELF TO THE VOCATION. OF PROVIDING SUPPORT TO SURVIVORS. OF BOTH DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL SEXUAL VIOLENCE. FOR MANY OF US THE IDEA OF BEING AN ABUSIVE PARTNER MAKES ABSOLUTELY BEING WITH AN ABUSIVE PARTNER MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WE PRIDE OURSELVES ASKING WHY THEY STAY. IF ONLY THAT WERE TRUE AND THAT SIMPLE. HOWEVER THE REASON THAT MANY SURVIVORS REMAIN SILENT AND IN THE SHADOWS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IS BECAUSE THE ABUSE ISN'T JUST PHYSICAL IS ALSO EMOTIONAL. IT IS TO THAT EMOTIONAL SKEWS ME ABUSE THAT ABUSER CAN CREATE A CAGE BY WHICH THE VICTIM FEELS THAT SHE OR HE CANNOT ESCAPE- MY WILL DO MY WORK I'VE LEARNED THAT THE KEY TO GETTING A SURVIVOR TO LEADER SITUATION IS CREATING A SUPPORT SYSTEM. AROUND THEM THAT GIVES THEM THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL BE PROTECTED ONCETHEY LEAVE THEIR SITUATION. EMPIRE PROTECTED I DO NOT JUST MEAN MORAL SUPPORT. I MEAN LONG TERM HOUSING WHICH SEEMS TO BE A CONSTANT COMING UP DUE OUT TODAY LEARNING SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN TO OBTAIN CAREERS THAT PAY A LIVABLE WAGE. LEGAL SUPPORT AND COUNSELING TO HELP SURVIVORS REHABILITATE THEIR INNER SELF AND DO THAT REHABILITATION BEGIN THE PROCESS OF REGAINING THEIR VOICE. YOU CAN ARREST AND YOU YOU CAN ARREST AN ABUSER EVERY SINGLE TIME BUT IT WILL NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE THE MOMENT THE ABUSER IS RELEASED THEY WERE RELY ON THE MENTAL HOLD THEY HAVE ON THE VICTIM TO REGRETREGAIN CONTROL OVER THAT PERSON'S LIFE. BY BREAKING THE METAL HOLD WE CAN BREAK THE ENTIRE CYCLE AND ALLOW VICTIMS THE CONFIDENCE THEY NEED TO BREAK AWAY AND THRIVE I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM MIKE WILSON AND I KNOW PERSONALLY FIRSTHAND. YOUR PASSION IN THE SUBJECT AREA AND THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR GOOD WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY- WITH THAT WE WILL GO TO CHRIS TO COLON- POLICY. DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER PRECIADO YOU HOSTING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT SESSION. OF MY NAME IS KRISTA COLOGNE I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIPS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WE ARE THE STATEWIDE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COALITION WHICH MEANS THAT I HAVE THE TREMENDOUS PRIVILEGE IN HONOR OF WORKING EVERY DAY WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICE PROVIDERS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. WE'VE HEARD FROM THE- PREVIOUS PAST. MANY MONTHS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT KOBE AND AS PRESENTED IN THEIR WORK SOME OF WHICH YOU HAVE HEARD HIGHLIGHTED ALREADY BY STATE SPEAKER- SO I'LL IRATE. NO MOVE INTO SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ONE. OF ON THE GROUND US AN INSIGHT. VIOLENCE IS A PANDEMIC IN THE STATE LONG BEFORE CO EFFORT BY- THE NEEDS AND CHALLENGES. OF SURVIVORS PREDATE. AND WELCOME TO ON PAST THE FANDOM WITH ACTION WHICH WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AS THE STATE TO BE ABLE. I'M COMING HOUSE OF COURSE EXACERBATED MANY OF THE IS NEEDED HIGHLIGHTED DISPARITIES- HERE WITH OUR STATE THAT DEMAND OUR ATTENTION AND THE URGENCY OF OUR ACTION. FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT US TO KEEP IN MIND AND THE STATE THAT I WAS BE HOPEFULLY COME TO AN END OF CONVINCING. AS VACCINATION RATES INCREASE IF THIS CONTINUES TO DECLINE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AT THE END OF COALBED ON SURVIVORS WILL BE FELT LONG AFTER. WE KNOW THAT THE TRAUMA SURVIVORS ARE EXPERIENCING DURING THIS TIME WILL TAKE TIME TO HEAL FROM THE- UNCERTAIN DEMAND FOR SUPPORT AND SERVICES AND HOUSING AND ACCESS. TO OUR COURTS WILL CONTINUE. I'M JUST THE SUMMER WHEN WE THOUGHT WE HAD TURNED A CORNER AND SEE A REAL CHANGE- ONE OF LOCAL PROGRAM SHARED WITH ME THAT IN THE FIRST FIVE DAYS OF THE MONTH THEY DID AS MANY LEGAL IN TEXAS THAT WOULD TYPICALLY DO IN A FULL THIRTY DAY AND- I'M SO WE KNOW THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOSEN RESTRICTIONS SURVIVORS ARE COMING FORWARD LOOKING FOR. SUPPORT SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE AT THE STATE LEVEL ARE THERE TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT SURVIVORS FOR THE DURATION. AND OF COURSE ONE OF THOSE KEY AREAS OF SUPPORTER IS IN THE REALM OF HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. YOU HEARD ALREADY FROM SO MANY OF THE SPEAKERS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HOUSING SO I'M NOT GOING TO REITERATE THAT. BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS IN WHICH WE HAVE THE STATE CAN DO BETTER. I'M TOO OFTEN WHEN THE STATE CONVERSATIONS CENTER ON HOMELESSNESS AND THE INCREDIBLE NEED TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE. A DISCUSSION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FRANKLY ON WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS IS LEFT OUT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. ALTHOUGH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF WOMEN'S HOMELESSNESS AND ALTHOUGH BY DEFINITION DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS ARE HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS. ARE HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM CAN CONTINUE TO DO BETTER AT RECOGNIZING. SECTION INCLUDING ENSURING EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE PROGRAM SERVING SURVIVORS IN ANY OF OUR BUDGETS AND FUNDING- APPLICATIONS. OUT FROM THE STATE- INCLUDING DEDICATED FUNDING EXPLICITLY WITHIN THE HOMELESSNESS BUDGET- FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I WAS SAYING THAT WHEN REALIZE D. WITH THE HOMELESSNESS. WHICH WAS SO OFTEN- THE PHONE SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE PER. FROM PROVIDE PERSON DONE AND- IN ORDER TO PROTECT SURVIVORS WE PROTECT SURVIVOR CONFIDENTIALITY BY NOT PROVIDING INTENDS PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT THEM IS MASSIVE DATABASE. AND SO FOR OUR CITY IS COUNTY IS THAT OUR STATE LEVEL TO WORK WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO DO COLLECTS TREMENDOUS INFORMATION THAT IS HELPFUL IN DEMONSTRATING HOW THEY ARE MEETING OUR HOMELESSNESS SCHOOLS. HOW THEY ARE SERVING A KEY PORTION OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. I'M TO MAKE SURE THE BACK CORPORATE AND BECAUSE WE KNOW WITH THE DATA BECAUSE COUNTY BUT AT. WHAT WE FOCUS ON AND SO IF WE LEAVE OUT THE NEEDS OF VICTIMS SERVICE PROVIDERS SURVIVORS THIS ORDER. WILL CONTINUE TO BEST. THIS CONGRESS ON HOW ON THE INTERNATIONAL ONE OF SHARE SOME DEEP. TO THE- I'M FUNDED THROUGH VICTIMS FOR TO HELP WE HAVE ONE OF THE MANY PROGRAMS CALLED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOUSING FIRST WHICH IS PROVIDING FLEXIBLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM ALMOST AS PREVENTION RAPID RE HOUSING FOR SURVIVORS AND HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL. FORTUNATELY IT'S LARGELY FULLY FUNDED THROUGH FEDERAL DOLLARS WHICH HAD BEEN DECLINING PRECIPITOUSLY AND THIS YEAR THE STATE BUDGET COMMITTEE REALLY HEARD US AS WE REACTED TO NEWS THAT- SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY BE FACING SIGNIFICANT COSTS OF US DOLLAR. AND THE STATE BUDGET THAT WAS PASSED THE SUMMER INCLUDED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO HOLD BACK FILL THOSE CUTS WHICH HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS BREATH OF FRESH AIR IN THE SERVICE PROVIDERS BROUGH THE LITTLE EASIER KNOWING THAT THIS MODEL THEIR MERGING SEA SHELTERS SO MANY OTHER PIECES OF THEIR WORK WE'RE NOT GOING TO. BE THE ONE REALLY APPRECIATE- BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON AND THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE. UP WORK. BUT OF COURSE WE CAN'T ABOUT HOW- OR NOT ANNOUNCER TALK ABOUT PART. AND THE CHAO OF IF HOUSING THE STATE. AND ECONOMIC. HUGE CAR OF THE THAT DO CONTINUE TO HEAR AND SEE. RIGHT HEARD FROM SPEAK ALL. ABOUT THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. AND THEIR WAYS FOR US TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER THE LEGISLATURE HAS A PENDING TO YOUR BILL WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS THAT SB THREE SEVENTY THREE BY SENATOR DAVE VAN WHICH ADDRESSES DEBT COLLECTION AGAINST SURVIVORS FOR DEBTS THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW WERE TAKEN OUT THEIR NAME OR POLITICAL WORST INTO TAKING OUT- BECAUSE OF THE ABUSE THEY WERE EXPERIENCING. REDUCING THAT. AS THE FORD BASICALLY. BUT WE CAN ALSO DO MORE TO IMPROVE OUR CALVET SYSTEM AND HOW IT RESPONDS TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGUIAR-CURRY AND ALSO TO ALL CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING PROPERTY INCLUDING SURVIVORS WHO MAY NOT SELF IDENTIFY WITH THE COLORS PROCESS WITHIN A IN FACT ARE GOING. TO BE. I'M CONTINUE ATTENTION ONIONS LIKE CHILD CARE WHICH IS A TREMENDOUS NEED FOR SURVIVORS ESPECIALLY CHILD CARE THAT'S AVAILABLE OUTSIDE OF THE NINE TO FIVE MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WORK WEEK. WE CAN ALSO DO MORE TO EMPHASIZE THINGS LIKE FLEXIBLE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS DIRECTLY TO SURVIVORS TO HELP THEM MEET THEIR FINANCIAL NEEDS. AND INCREASING GENERAL BENEFITS THROUGH THINGS LIKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE- IT SIX STATUS BROAD RANGE. FOR THOSE THAT SUPPORTS CAN NOT ONLY HELP TO SUPPORT SURVIVORS WHO ARE HEALING FROM THE PACIFIC EXPERIENCE BUT ALSO CAN GENERALLY WORK TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF VIOLENCE EVER OCCURRING. AS WE REDUCE ECONOMIC STRESS AND OUR FAMILY IS REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF YOU. I LOVE. YOU START TO WRAP UP TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO REALLY PROVIDE SOME DEEP APPRECIATION OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE. THERE ARE THE EPITOME OF AN ESSENTIAL WORK FOR. THEIR WORK NEVER STOPPED THE CRISIS LINE CONTINUED TO RING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN- AND THEY HAVE PROVIDED SERVICES BOTH REMOTELY AS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE ADAPTATION BUT ALSO IN PERSON DESPITE THE RISKS THAT IN PERSON SERVICES CONTINUES TO BRING TO THEIR OWN PERSONAL HELP AND SEE. I FOR PROGRAM OF THEIR STRONG RIGHT NOW THEY'RE STRUGGLING BURNOUT AND STRUGGLING WITH THE VICARIOUS TRAUMA THEIR EXPERIENCING. THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH THE LOW OKAY THAT THEY ARE CONSTRAINED BY BECAUSE OF THEIR BUDGETS GRANTS ABOUT. STRUGGLING WITH HIGHER- AND WE KNOW WE CAN'T SUPPORT SURVIVORS WITHOUT THE STAFF THERE YES PROGRAM. FINALLY FOR ALL THAT WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE HARMS OF THE IMMENSE TRAUMA THAT SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING. WE BELIEVE OUR BELIEF THAT THIS IS NOT AVAILABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THAT IT IS TIME FOR US TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS AND ON PREVENTION. RIGHT FOR EVERY EVERY HARM THAT THIS HAPPENED WE KNOW THAT WE CAN PREVENT US FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS- I WANT TO APPRECIATE AGAIN IN THIS YEAR'S STATE BUDGET THERE WAS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION. WHICH IS THE HIGHEST I'VE EVER SEEN. AND IT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT IS NOT GOING. SO WELL THAT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WILL SUPPORT PROGRAMS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. OF GRAHAM WHAT WE NEED AS LONG TERM ONGOING- PREVENTION AT. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO SUPPORT PREVENTION BY HELPING SUPPORT SOME SHIFTS IN SOCIETY OF ALL CONDITIONS SUCH AS CONTINUING TO SUPPORT CHANGE IN OUR SOCIAL NORMS THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS MENTION OF POSSIBLE WE'RE COMING UP ON OCTOBER WHICH IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THIS ISSUE. WE CAN CAN TO SITE A LEVEL CHANGE STRENGTH AFTER SUPPORT FOR- ANDERSON. THE FLOW THOSE. PART ATHLETES THAT LEAD TO VIOLENCE SUCH AS EARLY CHILDHOOD IN HOME VISITATION PARENTING SKILLS AND MARK. AND WITH ALL OF THIS THAT I'VE SHARED BARELY SCRATCH THE SURFACE I HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND WE HAVEN'T TALKED. MUCH ABOUT CHILDREN SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES SO MUCH MORE AND NEED FOR EVERY AGENCY WITH AND OUR STATE GOVERNMENT FOCUSED ON DOMESTIC- IS REALLY IMPERATIVE. AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL RIGHT NOW ORDERED PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATIONS WORKING ON THE NATIONAL ACTION PLAN TO ADDRESS GENDER BASED FINAL. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT HERE AND HARPER OF I THINK THE CALIFORNIA LOCAL I. WITH EACH AND EVERY STATE AGENCY THAT IS TOUCHING THE SURVIVORS THERE NEEDS. REALLY INCORPORATING THE NEEDS. OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SO THEREFORE. SO THERE'S CLEARLY CHEN BUT WORKS TO BE. I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THAT WORK AS A PARTNER WITH ALL OF YOU. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HOSTING THIS CONVERSATION. CHRYSOCOLLA THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INSIGHTFUL TESTIMONY AND WE WILL NOW GO TO A TEAM THAT RESOLVES. WESTERN MAKE IT AFTERNOON YES GO AHEAD YEAH. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE I'M AT I AM WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY I AM ONE OF THEIR POLICY ADVOCATE. WESTERN CENTER IS A STATE WIDE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW FIRM THAT REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF LOW INCOME AMERICANS IN NEED OF HOUSING HEALTH CARE AND PUBLIC BENEFITS. PRIOR TO JOINING WESTERN CENTER I WAS EIGHT TENANTS RIGHT TO THE BEACH AND DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND LOCK ANGELA RYE FRESH ALIVE IN THE PICTURE AS WELL AS WORKING WITH SURVIVORS ANYTHING EVICTION. AND ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE PROVIDED IN SECTIONS THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE A VERY TOUGH DECISION BETWEEN FACING HOMELESSNESS OR ABUSE AND OFTEN TIME BECAUSE THEY HAD THE DECISION- THEY EITHER FELL INTO HOMELESSNESS. OR THEY WENT BACK TO THE YEAR. AND SO WE KNOW THAT HOW IS. IN HOW MUCH ARE IN. LEAN BACK WE THAT NINE TWO PER. OF WOMEN WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED SOME FORM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND 50% OF WOMEN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WE'RE EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THEIR HOMELESSNESS. AND ANOTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IN THE DISCUSSION IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT INTERPERSONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DID NOT IMPACT ALL SURVIVORS THE SAME WAY THAT THOSE SURVIVORS WORK FROM MARGINALIZED IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES OFTEN FACE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO SERVICES AND THAT BE LANGUAGE BARRIERS DISCRIMINATION BASED ON THEIR STATUS. OR OTHER TYPES OF HOUSING BARRIERS- FOR EXAMPLE RACIAL OR ETHNIC BARRIERS TO ACCESSING HOUSING. FOR IMMIGRANT WOMEN THERE IN THE VIOLENCE AFTER THEY EMIGRATE TO THE UNITED STATES BUT WE DID WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE AND REPORTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES FOR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN REPORTS OF ICE ARRESTING SURVIVORS REPORT THEIR RECEIPT. AND OTHER VIBER TO SEEK RELIEF THROUGH PROTECTIONS SUCH AS BALLOT OR TRIED TO ENGAGE IN AND BENEFIT THAT THEY MAY HAVE BETTER LEAVE. THERE'S A POWER DYNAMIC BECAUSE THEIR ISSUES ARE HAVE TO BE A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES SOMETIME BUT JUST TO BE. AT THE STATE. I ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATION THAT IDEA IS THE BILL WESTERN CENTER BECAUSE- CALLED EIGHTY FOUR. SIXTY ONE RIGHT THEN WE MEMBERS. WHICH YOU MAY. PASSED JUST. AND BILL WILL CREATE EQUITY IN UNDOCK AND WORK. I GOT TO FORM FEDERAL IN THE WITH THE FOR THE PRIVATE I THINK YOU. KNOW HAPPEN MANAGED. BURDEN OR ADMINISTER PROCESS THE FOR THAT. TO ACT SERVICES. THEY CAN DO SO WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY ADMINISTRATIVE. DELAYS BUT I WANT TO CENTER AT MY CONVERSATION MAINLY ON. THAT IS MY SPECIAL. AND REMAIN RECOGNIZE. RATHER EIGHT DO BETTER AND PROVIDING HOUSING SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS. AND SO THE FIRST ONE IN BY ENGAGING AND- AND IMPROVING SURVIVOR SERVICES. AND THE SURVIVOR SERVICES THAT WERE DEFECTING THE SECOND TO THE STATE HAVE TO BE TRAUMA INFORMED AND THEY HAVE TO BE SURVIVOR CENTERED AND THEY SHOULDN'T EXCLUDE PROVIDER RATE BASED ON STANDING. AND THEY SHOULD ALSO PRIVATE ACT THE THING UP BUT THERE IS. FOR EXAMPLE AND THE ADULT VALLEY AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT RIGHT IT. WELL ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IS THAT THE SURVIVOR GOES TO THE ACTUAL BRICK AND MORTAR AREA. AND IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY IT'S A PRETTY LARGE AREA MANY SURVIVORS MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A CAR IN ORDER TO GET THE BRICK AND MORTAR AREA. AND SO THAT PROVIDE THE BARE YEAR FOR THEM TO ACCESS THE SERVICES. ONE WAITED. THAT WOULD NEED TO INVEST IN LOW BARRIER MOBILE THIRD THING. THAT WILL NEED TO MEET THE SURVIVOR IN AN AREA WHERE THEY FELT UNCOMFORTABLE THAT COULD BE LIKE A COFFEE SHOP OR PARK OR WHEREVER THEY FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE. SO THAT THERE IS THAT- BUT THEY CAN MEET THE SURVIVOR AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES. THERE'S ALSO PROGRAMS THAT HAVE I KNOW LANGUAGE ACCESS OR BECAUSE THEY ARE WORKING REMOTE IT'S YOU ACCESS EACH TRANSLATOR. AND WE WANT TO WORK PROGRAMS THAT USE LANGUAGE BARRIER. AND ALTHOUGH THING FOR THE I'M ACCESS TO SERVICE. AND WE DO FIND IN SOME AREAS THAT- THERE IS. NOT A GREAT UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE LINK OF HOUSING SERVICES. PROVIDERS AND THOSE EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. BECAUSE THEY DO YOU FACE. DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS COMPARED TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT OF YET. EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ANY HOUSING PROVIDERS OR ANY SERVICES THAT OFFER HOUSING SERVICES. MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE THOMAS INFORMED AND VERY UNIQUE TO PROVIDE FOR. AND THAT'S AREA THAT WE WOULD TO BOOK ON THAT LIKE THE STATE OKAY ON IS. TRUMP THE THIRD. DID YOU WHAT DID FOR THEM AND FOR THE UNIQUE SITUATION AND ONE OF THE BEST WAY THEY CAN DO THAT BY PROVIDING UNRESTRICTED. I'M CAPS DIRECT FUNDING TO THE SURVIVOR THEMSELVES. NOW CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAVE NINETEEN ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO YOU HAVE FEDERAL FUNDING OUR FEDERAL PRACTICAL FINDING MORE SURVIVORS. BUT THE SURVIVOR OFTEN HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM RATHER THAN THE PROGRAM GIVING THE FUNDING DIRECTLY TO THE PROVIDER. AND NUMBER EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I SAW- WELL LITIGATING A PARTICULAR IN THE- YOU CAN'T THEM OFF AND TO LIVE IS THAT. FEEDS SURVIVOR HAD IT THE ABUSER ARRESTED AND REMOVED FROM THE HOME. BUT THE FACT THE RUBBER COULDN'T PAY FOR THE RENT BECAUSE- YOU. YOU'RE CONTROLLING ALL OF THE FINANCES AND THE SURVIVOR DIDN'T HAVE ECONOMIC SECURITY. FOR THE ORGANIZATION THAT WE WORK WITH OFFERED TO PROVIDE THE LANDLORD WHERE. THE RENT THE LANDLORD REFUSED TO TAKE IT IN THE LANDMARK DID NOT WANT TO FINE. INVADE THEIR TAX DOCUMENTS. I KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE OPTION FOR THE PROVIDER. THEY CAN EITHER CONTINUE WITH THE ADDICTION AND ADDICTION PROTECTION FOR SURVIVORS ARE NOT VERY STRONG IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE- SOME OF. THE LARGE. OR THEY CAN I HAVE A SETTLEMENT OF AND OUT AND HOMELESSNESS TEMPORARY SHELTERS. AND UNFORTUNATELY MY- AND HAD TO GO IT OPTION AND SHE- ALMOST NEXT. BUT THIS NOT HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM A VERY IN SHE THE FUNDING TO GIVEN TO. BECAUSE SHE COULD HAVE. THE RENT GOING FORWARD AND THE- AND THERE WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT. DOCUMENT REQUIRE NAY FROM THE PROGRAM. AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT PROVIDE VERY- YOU NEED SOME FOR DATE WE HAVE TO TRUST THAT THEY WILL USE IT FOR THEIR NEEDS YEAH KNOW WHETHER THAT- I HAD ONE MOM WHO HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE RENT OR PAYING. FOR THE ON HER CAR. AND BUT THE LAST THING THAT I DO WANT TO FOCUS ON IS AS DEVELOPING AND FINDING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT WORKING CONTENT INJECTION WITH COMMUNITY TO BUILD LASTING RELATIONSHIPS AND WORK THE PRIVATE FACILITY. AS WE'VE HEARD THERE IS A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PARTICULARLY FOR SURVIVORS. AND THERE IS A WAY THAT WE CAN TRY TO COME BACK SOME OF THAT ONE OF BY DEVELOPING. OUT OF. HOUSING. AND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. RIGHT OKAY AND THAT DON'T WORK IN CHEN IN THE CASE AND BROWN. BUT THE OTHER THING THAT WE CAN DO AND WITH OUR LOCAL LANDLORDS ARE LOCAL PH A IS THAT OUR LOCAL ORGANIZATION TO DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION AND THE LANDLORD THAT WILL. SPECIFIC NEEDS AFTER FIVE OR THREE EIGHT. SOME TIMES WE ALSO HEAR THAT SURVIVOR CAN FADE. YEAH DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE OR THEY MAKE A PROACTIVE. LANDLORD OR THEY NEED SOME SORT OF INTERVENTION SERVICES. AND BY WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS AND THE HOUSING PROVIDERS. WE CAN TRY. TO BUILD SOME OF THAT GAP. LASTLY DO TO- SAY THAT THEY'RE ALSO HAVE TO BE A **** AND THEN- AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OR SURVIVORS FROM TEN AND EMERGENCY SHELTER TO WIN AND A VARIETY OF STATE STABLE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR SURVIVORS FOR A MINUTE SO WE NEED TAKE FILLED- I'M IN A WAY THAT. CENTER SURVIVOR VOICES AND ALSO SHIP THEM TOWARD HAVING ABLE AFFORDABLE PERMANENT HOUSING. THE ONE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU AND THE MEMBERS FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT MEETING AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH TINA RESOLVES AND WE CLEARLY HAVE HEARD A FROM. MESSAGE THROUGHOUT THE TESTIMONIES TODAY HOUSING IS TOP PRIORITY TO BE ABLE TO FIND SAFE PLACES AND ENVIRONMENTS FOR VICTIMS TO BE ABLE TO GO AND BEGIN THE RECOVERY PROCESS. AS WELL AS- JOBS AND BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP THAT INDEPENDENT ENVIRONMENT AWAY FROM THE ABUSER. AND INCLUDING THE IN THAT WOULD BE- EDUCATION AND JOB TRAINING- AND THEN- ACCESS ACCESS TO EFFICIENT PROGRAMS OR SHALL I SAY AFFECT OR OFFICIAL ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS. SO THOSE ARE ALL VERY VERY IMPORTANT HOUSING ALSO BEING AN ADDITIONAL PASSION OF MINE. AND- I REALLY HAVE A I'VE I'VE LEARNED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF NOT JUST AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT ACCESS TO THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE. BUT FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO KNOW ABOUT THEM FIRST AND THEN BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE AND BE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO THEM IS ALSO JUST AS IMPORTANT. I DO HAVE AND WE HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES LEFT- BEFORE CLOSING I DO HAVE A QUESTION THAT JANET SAID LEE HAD MADE REFERENCE TO. SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT WAS. WE IT THERE'S ME REAL- A REAL SHARP AND THAT WAS- PREVENTION. AND WE'VE ALWAYS HEARD THE PHRASE AND AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN A POUND OF CURE. AND MY QUESTION WOULD BE AND THIS IS FOR ANY OF THE PANELISTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK BUT- JANET SAID LEE HAD MADE REFERENCE TO IT. HOW CAN WE DISRUPT THE DEVELOPMENTAL PATHWAYS TOWARD INTERPERSONAL INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE THAT PIPELINE ENDS I BELIEVE SEVERAL SPEAKERS AND PANELISTS SPOKE OF IT AS A CYCLE- BUT HOW CAN WE DISRUPT THAT CYCLE AND HOW CAN WE- DISRUPT THE PIPELINE. THAT LEADS INTO- IN A PERSONAL INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. AND I DID NOTE GEN I HAD INSIDE SAID SHE HAD MADE REFERENCE TO IT OR IF ANY OTHERS SPEAKERS ON THE PANEL WANTED TO SPEAK AS WELL. SINGLE PANELIST TWENTY TWO I THINK GO AHEAD. RIGHT I THINK THAT JANET IS ACTUALLY ON MUTE AND THEN I'M HAPPY TO OF FOLLOW UP. COMMENTS YOU. GOING OKAY YEAH I WOULD GONNA I THAT COULD ACTS IS AN ERC IN THE AREA I'M GOING TURN OKAY GRIFFIN LET HER SPEAK BUT I WILL TELL YOU IT DOES GO VERY TO EDUCATE EARLIER OUR- KNOW AND ALSO WHERE I DID SPEAK ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE FOR- BATTERS THAT THEY NEED TO GET INTO THESE PROGRAMS AND SO THAT THEY DON'T SHE SHE'S VIOLENCE TO THEIR CHILDREN AND THAT THAT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO END THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE WHICH IS. PERVASIVE THROUGH THIS PROBLEM AND SO- IT DOES REQUIRE AN EARLY INVESTMENT AND EDUCATION BUT CHRIS I TURN TO YOU BECAUSE I DO KNOW THAT YOU WORK IN THIS. AREA- QUITE A BIT. JUST WE HAVE A MORE I'M JUST A MAN LEFT. IF YOU CAN. GIVE US A BEST ANSWER QUICK IS A CAN. HEY A QUICK FIRST BILL IN. CAN KIND TO. AT LOCAL PER TO THIS WORK AND THERE CAN AND THEY'RE IN. INFLUENTIAL AND- IS EMBARKING ON CHANGING CULTURE AND NORMS AND THINGS LIKE OUR SPORTS- AND THEY'RE DOING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS- AND BEERS ARE ESSENTIAL WAYS WE CAN'T ASSUME THAT FOLKS GROW UP. KNOWING AND SEEING WHAT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS LOOK LIKE THAT'S SADLY NOT THE NORM AND ALL OF OUR HOMES NOR ARE ALL PERRANCE EQUIPPED TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT. SOME OF THE OTHER WAYS I THINK THOSE LAKE IN HOME VISITATION PROGRAMS FOCUS ON TEACHING CONSENT AND BOUNDARIES FROM YOU KNOW PRE K. LEVELS ON OCT. PARENTING CLASSES ENGAGING WITH COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES THAT MAY BE AT RISK- AND AGAIN SOME OF THOSE FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC SUPPORTS THAT CREATE- THE BROADER REDUCTION OF STRESSORS. THAT MAY OCCUR IN FAMILY. THANK YOU CHRISTOPHER THAT AND- I REALLY WANT TO THANK COMMISSIONER SAID LEE MISS RUSSELL VICE MAYOR WILSON AND MISS COLOGNE AND MISS WAS ALMOST AND MISTER SANCHEZ WITH THE AMAZING WORK. THAT YOU ALL DO ON- ON BEHALF OF SURVIVORS FOR INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE I WOULD ALSO. LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE IS PUBLIC COMMENT IN HERE. AND IF WE COULD. PLEASE- DISTANCE UP HERE AT THE MIKE. M. THEN WE WILL ALSO GO TO THE MODERATOR IF THERE ARE ANY- CALLS COMING IN AND JUST ONE MOMENT PLEASE GO AHEAD. YOU HEAR ME YES HI I'M INDIA JOHNSON I AM THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF YELLOW HEART COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FIRST AND FOREMOST FOR EVEN HOLDING THIS HEARING IT IS VERY IMPORTANT SPECIAL THAT WE'RE HOLDING THIS AND SPEAKING AND ADVOCATING FOR SURVIVORS. I WANT TO KEEP THIS BRIEF AND JUST WANT TO SAY THAT HIGHLIGHT ALL THE ISSUES OF VIOLENCE ARE CONNECTED HATE CRIMES AND STRESS FROM ONLINE SCHOOLING INCARCERATION AND MORE ALL FROM LACK OF RESOURCES IN EXACERBATING THE PERSONAL VIOLENCE. PHIL SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE WHITES THE SURVIVORS THAT SPOKE BRIEFLY TODAY WHICH THEY ARE SURVIVORS COULD THEY SURVIVE A MENTAL TRAUMA SO I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT LANGUAGE CHOICE IN USING AND WHY WE HAD BEEN SPEAK TODAY. BUT THESE TESTIMONIES ARE ALL CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF COPING NINETEEN IS SPACES THAT ARE NOT TYPICALLY SEEN AS YOU KNOW FINALLY SO WITH THIS WE NEED TO ALWAYS REMEMBER THE MENTAL POTENTIAL PHYSICAL IMPACT THAT THIS CAN HAVE A CONTRIBUTED A PERSONAL VIOLENCE. WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE ADDITIONAL FORMS THAT CAMINO WALTER AND WILLIAM ALL BRAVELY STATED AND THAT IS A CRITICAL THAT ONE OF THE FACETS OF VIOLENCE WILL ALWAYS CONTRIBUTE TO ANOTHER FACET OF VIOLENCE WHICH THEN INCREASES HATE CRIMES LACK MOBILITY DEPLETED RESOURCES AND MORE ALL OF THAT IS TIED TO COMMUNICATION TROM OF MENTAL HEALTH AND EVERYTHING. SO WITH THAT WE MUST MAKE SURE ALWAYS HELPING OUT ALL ASPECTS OF VIOLENCE INCLUDING WHAT THEY SPOKE ON TODAY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE YOUTH AND STUDENTS THAT ARE HERE PRESENT THEY ARE OUR FUTURE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IS BEING TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE THE SAME THING THE SAME ISSUES OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE WILL ONLY CONTINUE.

TO TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE- AND HOW IT IMPACTS FAST FOOD WORKERS ORGANIZING WITH SEIU LOCAL TEN TO ONE. AND THE FIGHT FOR FIFTEEN AT FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS ARE INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS PLACES TO WORK. IN VALLEJO ALONE FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY A SINGLE MCDONALD'S HAD THIRTY FOUR ASSAULTS INCLUDING TWO SEXUAL ASSAULTS. IN THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN POTENTIALLY VIOLENT IN INCIDENTS. IN A SINGLE STORE AT THIRTY TWO EIGHTY NINE CINEMA WHERE POLICE HAD TO GET INVOLVED. WORKERS NEED TO BE EMPOWERED TO HELP PREVENT VIOLENCE AND MAKE THEIR STORE SAFER FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CUSTOMERS. ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FIFTY SEVEN LORENA GONZALEZ. WOULD ENABLE WORKERS TO HAVE THAT VOICE WORKERS HAVE CALLED FOR SECURITY OFFICERS DURING DANGEROUS PARTS OF THE DAY. BETTER LIGHTING TRAINING ON DE ESCALATION AND HOW TO MANAGE POTENTIALLY VIOLENT SITUATIONS AND THEPHYSICAL LAYOUT CHANGES TO MAKE THE STORE SAFER FOR THEM. THE MAJORITY OF FAST FOOD WORKERS ARE WOMEN AND WORKERS OF COLOR. AT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I THINK YOU ALL ADD FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING PLEASE SUPPORT WORKER EMPOWERMENT EFFORTS LIKE AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN. AS PART OF THE ANSWER TO DECREASE VIOLENCE AT WORK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SABRINA FERAL I'M GONNA TURNING IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND CURRENTLY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ALAMEDA COUNTY FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER. I'M THRILLED AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS SPACE. FOR HAVING A CONVERSATION TO RECOGNIZE VICTIMS SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. I'VE BEEN A PROSECUTOR FOR. TWENTY ONE YEARS NOW. AND DURING THAT TIME I'VE OBTAINED JUSTICE. IN THE CRIMINAL COURT ROOM. FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME SPECIFICALLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ELDER PROTECTION AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND NOW AS I SAID AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER. I AM DEFINITELY ABLE TO SEE HOW. A DRAMATIC INCIDENT LIKE OF VIOLENT CRIME. TRICKLED DOWN THROUGHOUT THE FAMILY SO IT'S NOT JUST THE MOTHER. THAT'S BEING AFFECTED IT'S THE CHILDREN AND THEY CARRY THAT THROUGH AND YOU SEE THAT THEY NEED THERAPY THEY NEED HELP WITH SCHOOL AND WHEN THEIR TEACHERS ON UNDERSTANDING WHY THEY ARE UNABLE TO GET A LESSON OR OR PROGRESS IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE LIVING WITH VIOLENCE WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT AND IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED HERE TODAY THAT BATTERERS ARE PART OF THE- THE WHOLE SOLUTION AND GETTING PREVENTIVE HEALTH FOR THEM.

THANK YOU SO MUCH. EMCEEING THE WITH THE PUBLIC- COMMENT. DO WE HAVE ANY- PUBLIC COMMENT THAT HAS COME IN OVER THE PHONE LINE MODERATOR. AT HI MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND IT LOOKS LIKE. WE HAVE ONE ONE IN PERSON LEFT. PLEASE HI MY NAME IS ALLEY I AM A SENIOR AT COLLEGE PARK HIGH SCHOOL CONTRA COSTA COUNTY- I'M A SURVIVOR OF TRAUMA AND I EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND THE MISHANDLING OF LAWN- OF MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE SO MUCH MORE REFORM AND HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TREATS ESPECIALLY SUICIDAL PEOPLE. AND THOSE LIKE CRISIS CALLS- I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SO MUCH MORE FORM AND BE LIKE MENTAL HOSPITAL- HOSPITALIZATION OF MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA I KNOW THERE IS A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE MENTALLY ILL. BUT I FEEL LIKE THAT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR SOMEONE TO LIKE. TO HEAL FROM WHAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED AND RECEIVE WHAT THEY NEED- I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE A LOT MORE. THOUGHT INTO HOW PEOPLE ARE TREATED ESPECIALLY THOSE VULNERABLE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT OPERATE THE SAME AS SOMEONE WHO IS LIKE DEEMED NORMAL- YEAH I THINK THAT ESPECIALLY WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN OR EVEN UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE THE BRAIN DOESN'T STOP DEVELOPING UNTIL TWENTY FIVE. THERE SHOULD BE MORE- AND SO THERE SHOULD BE MORE TRAINING BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COUNSELORS AND THERAPISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SOCIAL WORKERS ON HOW TO TREAT THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE WHAT I'VE SEEN I PERSONALLY LIKE IT HELPED ME A LOT TO GO THERE BUT I SAW KIDS REALLY STRUGGLING THAT'S ALL PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE OF HOW POORLY THEY WERE TREATED. AND THESE CHILDREN ARE USE YOUNG IS SEVEN YEARS OLD THEY ARE VERY MUCH STRUGGLING AND THEY- EVEN LIKE THEY CAN'T EVEN GO BACK HOME BECAUSE OF HOW TERRIBLE THEIR HOME LIFE IS AND I FEEL LIKE AS LIKE A STATE I KNOW YOU'RE PUT CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF THE BEST SUITS TO BE AN- BUT WE CAN DO BETTER. AND THE IMPACT THE- WE AS A STATE HAVE ON THESE LIKE YOUNG CHILDREN CAN SHAPE THEM FOREVER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING ME OUT AND I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS ARE TRYING YOUR BEST TO CHANGE EVERYTHING.
