SO THAT'S PROBABLY MOST

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:49.721
FRUSTRATING THING -- I WAS OTHER

NEIGHBORHOOD OVER THERE AND HAS

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:57.522

00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:07.899
THAT.

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:08.399
SO HOW DO WE CHANGE THAT

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:09.934
NARRATIVE.

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:11.636

BUT AS FAR AS THE CHILDREN GO

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:21.746
THAT PIPELINE IS STILL WIDE OPEN.

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:22.680
KIDS ARE FLOWING IN THE SYSTEM

00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:23.514
HOW DO YOU STOP THAT.

00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:25.250
HOW DO YOU STOP THAT IT'S A LOT

00:31:25.316 --> 00:31:27.919

AND EDUCATE THEM AND GIVE THEM

00:31:28.886 --> 00:31:29.921
WHAT THEY NEED.

THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT

00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:49.073
POLITICIANS HAVE DONE THAT NO

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.475
ONE'S DONE THAT.

00:31:50.541 --> 00:31:52.110

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:54.912
SOME AMOUNT. FOR FOR PROGRAMS

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:56.648
WILL THIS PROGRAM SHOULD IN

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:57.482
EARLIER.

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:59.717
LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THAT.

00:31:59.784 --> 00:32:01.586
SO HOPEFULLY THROUGH THIS --

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:02.220
COMMITTEE WE CAN COME UP WITH

00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:04.255
SOME IDEAS AND AND REALLY CHANGE

00:32:04.322 --> 00:32:06.190
THE NARRATIVE BECAUSE GUNS ARE

00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:07.925
GONNA BE AROUND GUNS ARE GOING

00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:09.494
AWAY LOT OF GUNS OUT THERE.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.195
ILLEGAL ILLEGAL GUNS.

00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:12.563
SO HOW TO STOP PEOPLE FROM

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.766
SHOOTING EACH OTHER.

00:32:14.832 --> 00:32:17.535
IN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ALSO THE

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:18.903
WAY YOU STOP THAT IS.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.204
TO GIVE THOSE KIDS NEIGHBORHOODS

00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:21.739
A CHANCE.

00:32:21.806 --> 00:32:22.674
EDUCATE THEM.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:23.975
THERE'S ONLY TOOLS WE CAN DO WE

00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:25.576
TALK ABOUT NUMBERS FOR NOT

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:27.045
READING A THIRD GRADE LEVEL.

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:28.446
BUT TIME IN THIRD GRADE IS A

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:29.380
GOOD CHANCE YOU'RE NOT GONNA

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:31.182
SUCCEED HOW WE CHANGE THAT

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:32.350
NARRATIVE.

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:33.251
THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO WITH SO

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:34.786
MANY BALLS IN THE AIR SO I I'M

00:32:34.852 --> 00:32:35.620
EXCITED.

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:36.287
THEY'RE GOING TO GET UP TO LEAVE

00:32:36.354 --> 00:32:37.522

INVITATION TO SPEAK HERE TODAY --

00:35:48.279 --> 00:35:50.348
AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THINK --

00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:52.149
CORNELIUS BOWSER AND TASHA

00:35:52.216 --> 00:35:53.951
WILLIAMS IN IN SAN DIEGO FROM

00:35:54.018 --> 00:35:55.620
COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE.

00:35:55.686 --> 00:35:57.288
SUPPORT TEAM -- THEY'VE BEEN AT

00:35:57.355 --> 00:35:59.156
THE FOREFRONT OF ADDRESSING

00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:01.092
VIOLENCE IN SAN DIEGO AND I'VE

00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:02.260
BEEN A FEEDER GREATLY FROM MY

00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:04.262
PARTNERSHIP WORKING WITH THEM AS

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:05.129
WELL.

00:36:05.196 --> 00:36:06.797
I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:08.866
THIS SESSION IS CRITICAL BECAUSE

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:11.002
THERE IS VERY LITTLE RESEARCH

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:12.336
EVEN AMONG ACADEMICS.

00:36:12.403 --> 00:36:14.605
ON GUN VIOLENCE THAT'S TROUBLING

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:16.274
BUT WHAT'S MORE TROUBLING IS

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.508
THAT THERE'S LITTLE RESEARCH

00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:19.610
CONDUCTED BY BLACK AND LATINO

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:21.812
SCHOLARS AND RARELY DO WE HEAR

00:36:21.879 --> 00:36:24.515
THE VOICES FROM PEOPLE OF COLOR --

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:26.050
FROM THE COMMUNITIES WHAT THE

00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:27.585
GUN VIOLENCE IS CONCENTRATES OF

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:28.953
THIS HEARING I THINK IS VERY

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.824
IMPORTANT -- IN BADLY NEEDED.

00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:34.625
TODAY I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT WERE

00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:35.226
FOR THIS PORTION OF THE OF THE

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:37.361
DISCUSSION I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:38.296
THREE THINGS TODAY.

00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:40.765
I'M GONNA START BY DEFINING WHAT

00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:41.999
IS GUN VIOLENCE IT'S A TERM

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:43.534
THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE USE I

00:36:43.601 --> 00:36:44.402
THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SOME

00:36:44.468 --> 00:36:44.936
CLARITY.

00:36:45.002 --> 00:36:46.904
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:49.507
USE THE TERM GUN VIOLENCE --

00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:51.475
THEN I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY LOOK

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:54.478
AT SOME DATA FROM SAN DIEGO FROM

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:56.180
THE CORONER'S OFFICE.

00:36:56.247 --> 00:36:58.983
IN TRYING TO EXPLORE HOW MUCH OF

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.419
THE HOMICIDES IN SAN DIEGO ARE

00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:05.022
TRIBUNE HERBAL TO FIREARMS.

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:06.457
AND THEN IN THE THIRD PART OF MY

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:08.726
DISCUSSION HERE TODAY I'M GONNA

00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:10.227
TALK ABOUT THE LINK.

00:37:10.294 --> 00:37:12.763
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.532
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND AND AS

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:16.334
A PRESSING ISSUE THAT SOME OF

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:16.934
YOU MENTION ALREADY I'M GONNA

00:37:17.001 --> 00:37:17.902
TRY.

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:19.370
TO BRING IT TO THE FOREFRONT OF

00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:20.771
OUR DISCUSSION TODAY.

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:23.240
SO LET ME START WITH WHAT IS GUN

00:37:23.307 --> 00:37:25.743
VIOLENCE.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.478
IN THE LITERATURE ON GUN

00:37:27.545 --> 00:37:28.946
VIOLENCE AND IN SOCIOLOGY

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:30.214
THERE'S A TERM.

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:32.183
KNOWN AS THE AVAILABILITY

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.952
HYPOTHESIS IN THIS IS THE IDEA

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:36.821
THAT DANGEROUS PEOPLE WILL FIND

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:39.924
IT EASIER TO GET A FIREARM.

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:44.261
IN GUN RICH ENVIRONMENTS -- AND

00:37:44.328 --> 00:37:45.896
THERE'S LOTS OF STUDIES THAT

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:48.099
SUPPORT THIS -- AND WHAT I WANT

00:37:48.165 --> 00:37:49.934
TO EMPHASIZE THOUGH IS THE

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:52.870
CONCLUSION IS NOT THAT MORE GUNS

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:55.773
PRODUCES MORE CRIME IT'S A

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.942
LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED -- WHAT

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:59.777
THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONSISTENT

00:37:59.844 --> 00:38:01.846
IN DEMONSTRATING IS THAT GUN

00:38:01.912 --> 00:38:04.749
PREVALENCE IS UNRELATED TO RATES

00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:05.916
OF ASSAULT?

00:38:05.983 --> 00:38:08.052
AND ROBBERY WHY BECAUSE THAT

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:12.056
THOSE ARE FORMS OF VIOLENCE.

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:14.492
SO THE STRONG FINDING IS THE GUN

00:38:14.558 --> 00:38:17.928
USE INTENSIFIES VIOLENCE MAKING

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:19.730
IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE VICTIM

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.532
OF AN ASSAULT OR ROBBERY WILL

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:23.267
DIE IN THE MEAT I THINK THE

00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:24.335
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS PROBABLY

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:25.636
THE BEST EXAMPLE.

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:27.605
THERE ARE SOME -- INDIVIDUALS

00:38:27.672 --> 00:38:29.674
THAT ARE PREDISPOSED TO DOMESTIC

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.541
VIOLENCE AND THEY WILL COMMIT

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:31.375
VIOLENCE.

00:38:31.442 --> 00:38:33.344
BUT YOU PUT A GUN IN THEIR HAND

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:36.280
THEN A PERSON IS MORE LIKELY TO

00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:37.715
DIE AND THAT'S THE SORT OF WAY

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:39.216
WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT.

00:38:39.283 --> 00:38:40.584
GUN VIOLENCE.

00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:42.253
SO IT FOLLOWS THAT IF WE COULD

00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:43.854
CURTAIL THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF

00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:46.090
CRIMINAL VIOLENCE THAN GUNS

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:47.725
WOULD DO LESS DAMAGE. FOR

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:49.193
EXAMPLE A DROP IN THE OVERALL

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.494
RATES OF VIOLENCE AS BEEN

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:52.496
COUPLED WITH AN EQUALLY SHARP

00:38:52.563 --> 00:38:54.932
DROP IN GUN VIOLENCE ROBBERIES.

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:58.169
RAPES AND ASSAULTS DECLINED 75%

00:38:58.235 --> 00:39:00.871
BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IN.

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:02.139
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AT TWENTY

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:04.542
NINE POINT ONE PER ONE HUNDRED

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:07.445
THOUSAND TO SEVEN POINT NINE PER.

00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:08.379
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND END GUN

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:11.382
VIOLENCE DECLINED LOCK STEP WITH

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:14.118
THE OVERALL VIOLENCE PROBLEM.

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:15.453
SO LET ME TRY TO GET TO THE

00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:16.921
POINT HERE WHAT WE MEANBY GUN

00:39:16.987 --> 00:39:17.855
VIOLENCE.

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:19.824
THE PROBLEM ISN'T JUST THE

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.926
AVAILABILITY OF GUNS BUT THE

00:39:21.992 --> 00:39:24.829
OVERALL AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE.

00:39:24.895 --> 00:39:28.099
IT'S THE COMBINATION OF GUNS AND

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:30.968
VIOLENCE THAT PRODUCES HIGHER

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:32.103
MURDER RATES AND THAT'S THE WAY

00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:33.871
THAT I'M GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:34.772
GOVERNMENTS I THINK IT'S

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:37.475
IMPORTANT. FOR PEOPLE TO KIND OF

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:38.909
YOU WHERE THOSE TWO COMPONENTS --

00:39:38.976 --> 00:39:40.311
SO WITHOUT A DOUBT THE ONE

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:41.679
STRATEGY FOR REDUCING GUN

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:43.347
VIOLENCE IS TO REDUCE CRIMINAL

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:45.282
VIOLENCE GENERALLY -- TAKING

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:47.651
STEPS TO REDUCE ALCOHOL AND DRUG

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:48.619
ABUSE.

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:50.387
BETTER TREATMENT FOR MENTAL

00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:52.523
ILLNESS REDUCE SCHOOL DROPOUT

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.458
RATES AND DEPLOYED POLICE

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:56.093
RESOURCES MORE STRATEGICALLY.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.595
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IS ALSO

00:39:57.661 --> 00:39:59.497
IMPORTANT AND WHAT I'M GOING TO

00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:00.931
EMPHASIZE TODAY.

00:40:00.998 --> 00:40:03.868
IS THE IMPORTANCE OF POLICE

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:05.536
COMMUNITY RELATIONS THAT

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:07.938
PARTICULAR FACTOR HASN'T BEEN

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:09.907
EMPHASIZED ENOUGH IN THE

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:10.908
LITERATURE AND I'M GONNA SAY

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:13.444
MORE ABOUT THAT IN JUST A BIT.

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:14.745
SO IF YOU DIFFERENTLY GUN

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:16.781
VIOLENCE IS ABOUT ACCESS THE

00:40:16.847 --> 00:40:17.882
SUPPLY.

00:40:17.948 --> 00:40:19.850
AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE

00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:21.252
MOTIVATIONS.

00:40:21.318 --> 00:40:22.887
THROW GUN VIOLENCE RESEARCH

00:40:22.953 --> 00:40:26.423
SHOULD FOCUS ON BOTH.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:31.929
OKAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- SO

00:40:31.996 --> 00:40:34.799
I'M USING THE THE DATA FROM SAN

00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:36.934
DIEGO TO TRY TO SAY SOMETHING

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:38.769
ABOUT A BIGGER PROBLEM IN THE

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:40.271
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:41.772
AND IN THE UNITED STATES EVEN

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:42.473
THOUGH WE'RE LOOKING AT SAN

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.775
DIEGO I THINK WHAT WE SEE IN SAN

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:46.710
DIEGO WE CAN SORT OF GENERALIZED

00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:48.512
TO LOTS OF CITIES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:50.014
AND TO THE COUNTRY.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.715
SO THE QUESTION THAT I'M TRYING

00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:54.251
TO EXPLORE HERE IS HOW MUCH DO

00:40:54.318 --> 00:40:57.254
GUNS ACCOUNT. FOR THE OVERALL

00:40:57.321 --> 00:40:59.223
SHARE OF HOMICIDES SO I'D LIKE

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.458
TO EXPLORE THIS ISSUE IN HERE WE

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:04.061
HAVE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DEATHS.

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:05.563
THIS IS DATA FROM THE CORONER'S

00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:07.898
OFFICE AND FROM THE SAN DIEGO A

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:09.533
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.101
ROUGHLY ABOUT THREE THOUSAND

00:41:11.168 --> 00:41:14.605
PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR -- IN

00:41:14.672 --> 00:41:16.507
ABOUT ACCIDENTS ACCOUNT FOR THE

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:19.510
LARGEST PERCENTAGE BUT 46%.

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:23.180
OF NATURAL CAUSES OR NEXT AT 34%

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:26.283
SUICIDE. 14% NOW JUST TO BE%

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:27.651
CLEAR I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

00:41:27.718 --> 00:41:28.686
SUICIDE TODAY.

00:41:28.752 --> 00:41:31.288
BUT ONE IMPORTANT SEEM RELATED

00:41:31.355 --> 00:41:33.557
TO GUN VIOLENCE IS SUICIDE AND

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:35.059
USUALLY SUICIDE.

00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:37.494
IS AT LEAST TWO TIMES HIGHER

00:41:37.561 --> 00:41:40.865
THAN -- HOMICIDES AS A RESULT OF

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:42.566
INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE.

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:43.934
OKAY SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.402
PICTURE LOOKS LIKE HOMICIDES

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:48.372
ACCOUNT 44%.

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:51.442
OF A MOST DEATHS EACH YEAR IN

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:54.044
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:54.345
[inaudible]

00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:55.946
OKAY.

00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:56.847
SO.

00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:58.382
LET'S LOOK AT THE HOMICIDE

00:41:58.449 --> 00:42:01.352
METHODS.

00:42:01.418 --> 00:42:02.987
JUST TO SORT OF ESTABLISH WHY

00:42:03.053 --> 00:42:04.722
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS ON

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:07.091
FIREARMS WHEN WE'RE TALKING

00:42:07.157 --> 00:42:08.859
ABOUT HOMICIDES IN COMMUNITIES

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.461
OF COLOR.

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:12.563
IN WHAT WE SEE HERE AND THIS IS

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.431
A CONSISTENT PATTERN THAT OF ALL

00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:16.834
THE HOMICIDES IN SAN DIEGO WE

00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:18.135
HAD NINETY THREE CASES WERE

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:19.937
MISSING SOME CASES BUT I THINK

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:21.772
THIS PATTERN GENERALLY HOLDS

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:24.775
TRUE -- OF ALL THE HOMICIDES IN

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:29.413
SAN DIEGO. 48% WERE FIREARM

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.115
RELATED.

00:42:31.181 --> 00:42:33.751
CUTTING STABBING KNIVES --

00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:36.620
CONSTITUTE ABOUT 21% AND BLUNT

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:40.190
FORCE ABOUT 16% SO WHAT'S THE

00:42:40.257 --> 00:42:42.793
TAKE AWAY FROM HERE FIREARM IS

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.228
THE LEAST FIREARMS ARE LEADING

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:47.831
SOURCE OF HOMICIDE JUST WANNA

00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:49.667
THAT.

00:42:49.733 --> 00:42:52.569
IN WE SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR IN

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:53.203
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN JUST SOLD

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.271
SO WE KNOW THIS ISN'T JUST A

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:57.308
TREND IT'S A CONSISTENT PATTERN --

00:42:57.374 --> 00:43:00.544
IT THE SAME STORY IN -- TWO

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:01.946
THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE HAD ROUGHLY

00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:04.581
THREE THOUSAND DEATHS. 47% OF

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:06.083
ARM OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.786
ACCIDENTS. 33% WERE NATURAL

00:43:08.852 --> 00:43:12.122
CAUSES SUICIDE 14% AGAIN

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:15.659
HOMICIDE -- WAS 4%.

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:19.596
AND IT'S THE SAME STORY IN.

00:43:19.663 --> 00:43:20.264
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN NEARLY HALF

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:22.066
THE HOMICIDES PRODUCED WERE

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:25.069
PRODUCED BY FIREARMS.

00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:28.238
CUTTING AGAIN STABBING WAS 22%

00:43:28.305 --> 00:43:29.707
BLUNT FORCE 19%.

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:32.943
IN A SIXTY ASIAN 7% SO WHY WHY

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.345
IS THIS IMPORTANT.

00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:36.680
SAN DIEGO IS A WINDOW INTO A

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:38.182
CONSISTENT PATTERN WHERE

00:43:38.248 --> 00:43:40.851
FIREARMS OVERWHELMINGLY ARE

00:43:40.918 --> 00:43:42.386
RESPONSIBLE.

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:43.554
FOR HOMICIDES.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.589
US IN WE SEE THE SAME PATTERN IN

00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:47.057
MOST CITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND WE

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:47.958
SEE.

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:49.593
A SIMILAR PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.995
COUNTRY SO THIS IS WHEN I SAY

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:52.629
STANDING AS A WINDOW INTO THE

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:53.998
COUNTRY I THINK THIS IS A IT

00:43:54.064 --> 00:43:55.499
MAKES ANNUAL RELEVANT IT'S NOT

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.801
JUST ABOUT.

00:43:57.868 --> 00:43:58.669
IT'S NOT JUST A LOCAL ISSUE.

00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:00.137
ALL RIGHT NOW I WANT TO TURN TO

00:44:00.204 --> 00:44:02.339
PART THREE OF MY TALK HERE.

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:04.041
AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:05.709
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:07.811
COMMUNITY.

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:09.279
AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO A

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:11.682
PRESSING ISSUE -- REGARDING

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:13.817
POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS FROM

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:17.054
MY RESEARCH.

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:18.589
POLICE USE OF FORCE.

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:21.158
IS THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE

00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:22.893
FACING BLACK AND LATINO

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.462
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:26.964
WE SEE THIS.

00:44:27.031 --> 00:44:30.501
AND MICHAEL BROWN -- WE SEE WHAT

00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:32.036
HAPPENED TO ERIC GARDNER.

00:44:32.102 --> 00:44:33.670
OF FULL LANDAU CASTEEL IN

00:44:33.737 --> 00:44:35.906
RECENTLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:37.941
STEFAN CLARK.

00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:40.677
THE QUESTION IS HOW IS POLICE

00:44:40.744 --> 00:44:43.347
USE OF FORCE RELEVANT TO GUN

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:45.349
VIOLENCE.

00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:47.518
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET

00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:48.952
ME TRY.

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.888
TO INVESTIGATE OR SAY LITTLE

00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:51.789
SOME PROVIDE LITTLE INSIGHT ON

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:53.223
THIS ISSUE FROM A QUOTE.

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:54.758
FROM A CRIMINOLOGIST NAME

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:57.261
RICHARD ROSENFELD HE'S THE

00:44:57.327 --> 00:44:58.495
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL

00:44:58.562 --> 00:44:59.930
INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE.

00:44:59.997 --> 00:45:02.566
AND HE WROTE A PAPER RECENTLY TO

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:04.134
EXPLAIN THE RECENT SPIKE IN

00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:06.537
HOMICIDE IN AMERICA.

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:09.139
AND HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:10.674
HE SAID WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:12.609
AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE MUCH LESS

00:45:12.676 --> 00:45:14.411
CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE THEN TO

00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:15.512
WHITES.

00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:18.348
COMPROMISED POLICE LEGITIMACY IS

00:45:18.415 --> 00:45:20.818
INSTITUTIONALIZE FEATURE.

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:22.219
OF DISADVANTAGED BLACK

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:24.088
COMMUNITIES.

00:45:24.154 --> 00:45:25.222
IT HELPS TO EXPLAIN THE

00:45:25.289 --> 00:45:26.957
PERSISTENCE THE PERSISTENCE OF

00:45:27.024 --> 00:45:28.258
RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF

00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:32.329
VIOLENCE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:33.764
AND WHAT I WANT TO SUGGEST HERE

00:45:33.831 --> 00:45:36.166
HERE'S THE CONNECTION WITH USE

00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:37.701
OF FORCE AND GUN VIOLENCE.

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:40.337
IS THAT AFTER HIGH PROFILE USE

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:42.172
OF FORCE INCIDENTS.

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:44.908
TRUST OF POLICE IN BLACK AND

00:45:44.975 --> 00:45:46.643
BROWN COMMUNITIES.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.745
DECREASES.

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:50.781
SOME IN THE MEDIA AND SOME

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:52.616
ACADEMICS HAVE REFERRED TO THIS

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:54.218
AS THE FERGUSON EFFECT SO THERE

00:45:54.284 --> 00:45:57.554
IS A TERM FOR THIS -- AND LOW

00:45:57.621 --> 00:45:59.356
TRUST IN POLICE HAS BEEN A

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:01.291
FEATURE HOWEVER IN BLACK

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:02.860
COMMUNITIES FOR SOME TIME BUT

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:04.428
THE POINT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:05.996
THAT THESE USE OF FORCE.

00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:10.534
INCIDENTS ONLY DEEPEN MISTRUST.

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:12.936
AND WHERE THE GUN VIOLENCE FITS

00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:14.905
INTO THE PICTURE IS IT PEOPLE

00:46:14.972 --> 00:46:17.641
ARE LESS INCLINED TO COOPERATE

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:19.009
WITH THE POLICE WHEN THERE IS A

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:20.444
SHOOTING.

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.946
AND THIS IS WHAT DRIVES UP.

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:24.148
GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS IS NOT A

00:46:24.214 --> 00:46:26.483
TRIVIAL FACTOR -- ROSENFELD WAS

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:27.651
DIRECTOR OF AN AYE JAYE

00:46:27.718 --> 00:46:29.153
SUGGESTED THAT THIS WAS ONE OF

00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:30.387
THE TOP THREE REASONS THAT MAY

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:33.257
BE DRIVING HOMICIDES IN THE

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:35.259
UNITED STATES BUT WE DON'T TALK.

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:38.362
ANOTHER ABOUT IT.

00:46:38.428 --> 00:46:40.164
THE BEATING OF FRANK JUDE'S A

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.431
TWELVE YEAR OLD BY AN OFF DUTY

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:43.133
MILWAUKEE POLICE OFFICER WROTE

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.768
ROCK THE CITY LEADING TO THE

00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:46.370
LARGEST NUMBER OF FIRINGS AND

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:47.738
DEPARTMENT HISTORY.

00:46:47.804 --> 00:46:49.540
FEDERAL CONVICTION OF SEVEN

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:52.509
OFFICERS IN A SERIES OF REFORMS.

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:55.012
A NEW STUDY PUBLISHED IN TWO

00:46:55.078 --> 00:46:55.546
THOUSAND SIXTEEN REVEALED

00:46:55.612 --> 00:46:56.947
ANOTHER ON SCENE BUT FAR

00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:58.882
REACHING IMPACT RESIDENTS IN

00:46:58.949 --> 00:46:59.550
PREDOMINATELY BLACK

00:46:59.616 --> 00:47:00.851
NEIGHBORHOODS IN MILWAUKEE WERE

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:04.288
FAR LESS LIKELY TO CALL.

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:06.623
911- AFTER BEATINGS THE DROP IN

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.691
NINE ONE ONE CALL SUGGESTS THAT

00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:09.960
THE INCIDENT ERODED TRUST IN

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:12.429
SHARPLY DAMAGE THE RELATIONSHIP.

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:14.131
BETWEEN THE POLICE AND

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:16.366
NEIGHBORHOODS -- AFTER USE OF

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:17.935
FORCE INCIDENTS SO THIS IS THE

00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:21.505
KEY HERE IS USE OF FORCE ISN'T

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:23.840
JUST ABOUT -- MISTREATMENT OF

00:47:23.907 --> 00:47:26.143
PEOPLE BUT IT HAS THE EFFECT OF

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:28.912
POTENTIALLY DRIVING UP GUN

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:32.182
VIOLENCE -- AS WELL.

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:33.850
AND SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME

00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:35.219
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:36.453
IN SACRAMENTO WITH TALKED ABOUT

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.788
OTHER CITIES BUT WE DON'T HAVE

00:47:37.854 --> 00:47:39.990
TO LOOK VERY FAR. TO SAVE MORE

00:47:40.057 --> 00:47:43.060
ABOUT THIS -- AND SO WHAT I WANT

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:44.828
TO DO IS BRIEFLY TAKE A LOOK AT

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:46.196
SOUTH SACRAMENTO THE MEADOW VIEW

00:47:46.263 --> 00:47:47.497
AREA.

00:47:47.564 --> 00:47:50.133
AND I ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THE

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.301
DEL PASO HEIGHTS AREA.

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:53.170
WHAT THESE TWO AREAS HAVE IN

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:53.804
COMMON LET'S START WITH MEADOW

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:56.106
VIEW IS IT THEY HAVE SOME OF THE

00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:58.408
HIGHEST POVERTY IN THE CITY OF

00:47:58.475 --> 00:48:00.077
SACRAMENTO SO WHERE THAT CIRCLES

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:01.211
DRAWN THERE?

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:03.280
THAT'S A ONE MILE RADIUS AROUND

00:48:03.347 --> 00:48:05.249
WERE STAFF ON CLARK WAS KILLED

00:48:05.315 --> 00:48:06.516
BY THE POLICE.

00:48:06.583 --> 00:48:09.386
AND THE AREAS WITH A HIGH YOUR

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:11.788
OF RED SHADINGS THE RED AREAS

00:48:11.855 --> 00:48:14.825
HAVE HIGHER RATES OF POVERTY.

00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:17.527
WE ALSO SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR --

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:19.229
WHEN WE LOOK AT DEL PASO HEIGHTS

00:48:19.296 --> 00:48:21.431
SO THAT CIRCLE AT THE TOP OF THE

00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:24.167
CITY THERE IS WHERE JOSEPH MAN?

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:25.602
WAS KILLED BY POLICE.

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:28.171
I BELIEVE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

00:48:28.238 --> 00:48:29.072
SIXTEEN AND LIKE.

00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:30.641
THE SOUTH SACRAMENTO AREA IT

00:48:30.707 --> 00:48:33.076
ALSO HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST

00:48:33.143 --> 00:48:36.013
POVERTY IN THE CITY AS WELL AND

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.648
THERE'S THERE'S THREE THINGS.

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:40.317
THAT THESE TWO PLACES HAVE IN

00:48:40.384 --> 00:48:40.951
COMMON THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:41.251
[inaudible]

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:43.086
FIRST.

00:48:43.153 --> 00:48:45.188
THESE ARE PLACES WERE THERE ARE

00:48:45.255 --> 00:48:46.556
THERE HAS BEEN A HIGH PROFILE

00:48:46.623 --> 00:48:48.392
USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS MENTIONED

00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:49.760
JOSEPH MANA MENTIONED STEP ON

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:51.962
CLARK -- THESE ARE ALSO AREAS

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:53.697
THAT ARE AMONG THE POOREST AND

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:55.499
MOST SEGREGATED BLACK AND LATINO

00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:57.534
COMMUNITIES IN THE CITY OF

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:58.935
SACRAMENTO.

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:01.772
THEY ALSO HAVE HIGHER RATES OF

00:49:01.838 --> 00:49:03.840
GUN VIOLENCE.

00:49:03.907 --> 00:49:05.909
MAC ROAD IN THE SOUTH IF YOU'RE

00:49:05.976 --> 00:49:07.944
FAMILIAR WITH SACRAMENTO -- IS

00:49:08.011 --> 00:49:09.680
AN AREA THAT CONSISTENTLY HAS

00:49:09.746 --> 00:49:10.914
SOME OF THE HIGHEST COMBINES IN

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:12.482
SACRAMENTO AND ONE IT'S NOT MAC

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:13.417
ROAD.

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:15.819
IT'S USUALLY THE DAHLE PASO

00:49:15.886 --> 00:49:18.288
HEIGHTS AREA -- IN THESE TWO

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:19.589
AREAS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF

00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:21.325
GUN VIOLENCE AND THE THIRD THING

00:49:21.391 --> 00:49:22.893
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:24.428
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE SOME OF

00:49:24.494 --> 00:49:26.797
THE LOWEST LEVELS OF PERCEIVED

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:27.898
TRUST.

00:49:27.964 --> 00:49:30.867
TOWARDS THE POLICE.

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:31.735
I CAN'T ELABORATE ON THIS

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:34.271
FURTHER BUT I RECENTLY COLLECTED

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:36.006
LARGE SCALE SURVEY DATA WE GET

00:49:36.073 --> 00:49:37.474
REGARDING THE PERCEPTIONS OF

00:49:37.541 --> 00:49:38.975
NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS WHICH I

00:49:39.042 --> 00:49:40.344
WHICH I PLAN TO RELEASE.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.546
AT A LATER DATE BUT LET ME JUST

00:49:42.612 --> 00:49:45.182
SAY ANECDOTALLY THAT THESE AREAS

00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:46.116
WE WE'VE I'VE.

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:47.651
COLLECTED SOME.

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:50.120
GOOD DATA IN THESE AREAS HAVE

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:52.422
NOTICEABLY LOWER RATES OF TRUST

00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:53.857
THAT QUANTITATIVE DATA ON THIS

00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:55.025
THEN THE REST.

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:57.594
OF THE CITY SO THE KEY POINT.

00:49:57.661 --> 00:50:00.097
IS THAT BOTH GEOGRAPHY AND RACE

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:01.965
MATTER WHEN IT COMES TO PERCEIVE

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:03.667
TRUST TOWARDS POLICE.

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:05.001
AND POOR BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:06.370
THAT HAVE LOWER RATES OF TRUST

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:08.839
TEND TO HAVE HIGHER RATES OF GUN

00:50:08.905 --> 00:50:09.906
VIOLENCE IN THIS IS I THINK

00:50:09.973 --> 00:50:12.209
SOMETHING.

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:14.044
THAT WE NEED TO EXPLORE FURTHER.

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:15.712
ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA SAY ONE LAST

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:18.548
THING HERE -- I THINK I'M DOING

00:50:18.615 --> 00:50:19.683
OKAY TIME RIGHT NOW YEAH YOU'RE

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:23.186
FINE -- AND THAT IS WHEN WE TALK

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:23.987
ABOUT.

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:25.622
COMMUNITY GUN VIOLENCE IS

00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:26.923
TYPICALLY THE TURN IT'S USED TO

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:28.392
EXPLAIN GUN VIOLENCE IN BLACK

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:30.594
AND LATINO COMMUNITIES -- WE

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:33.397
ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW IT

00:50:33.463 --> 00:50:34.664
AFFECTS POLICING.

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:36.700
AND SO -- COMMUNITY VOIGTS ALSO

00:50:36.767 --> 00:50:39.169
HAS AN EFFECT ON THE POLICE.

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:41.071
THE RECENT UNPROVOKED SHOOTING

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:42.539
OF NATALIE CORONA AND TORRENT

00:50:42.606 --> 00:50:43.607
TERRORIST.

00:50:43.673 --> 00:50:45.275
ARE THE CLEAREST EXAMPLES OF

00:50:45.342 --> 00:50:47.043
WRIST OFFICERS FACE GIVEN THE

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:48.979
LARGE NUMBER OF HAND GUNS IN

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:50.414
CIRCULATION.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.115
COMMUNITY VIOLENCE AFFECTS

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:55.685
POLICE AND THIS MUST BE PART OF

00:50:55.752 --> 00:50:57.721
THE DISCUSSION AS WELL.

00:50:57.788 --> 00:51:00.123
A CENTRAL QUESTION IS HOW MUCH

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:03.226
RISK DO POLICE FACE REGARDING

00:51:03.293 --> 00:51:04.594
GUN VIOLENCE.

00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:05.729
AND THE ASSUMPTION IS IF THEY'RE

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:07.564
EXPOSED TO A LOT OF RISK MAYBE

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:09.099
THE USE OF FORCE IS JUSTIFIED.

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:10.066
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M NOT

00:51:10.133 --> 00:51:11.268
GOING TO COMMENT ON BUT IT'S

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:13.937
CERTAINLY -- WORTH EXPLORING LOT

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:15.105
OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT THAT

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:17.007
IT'S NOT JUSTIFIED BUT IT STILL

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:18.809
NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED. TO ADDRESS

00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:20.076
ISSUES RELATED TO BUILDING TRUST

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:22.078
WE MUST ASK WHAT TYPE OF RHYS

00:51:22.145 --> 00:51:23.847
OFFICERS FACE ON PATROL IN DOES

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:26.016
IT JUSTIFY USE OF FORCE.

00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:28.585
ADDITIONALLY HOW DOES EXPOSURE

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:29.953
TO THE POTENTIAL COMBINES A

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.322
AFFECT THE WAY POLICE PATROL

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:34.825
THEIR BEATS AND HOW DOES THAT

00:51:34.891 --> 00:51:36.660
AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO TRUST TO

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:37.494
BUILD TRUST.

00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:40.263
IN AREAS THAT WE NEED TO REDUCE

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:41.898
GUN VIOLENCE AS WELL.

00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:43.467
AND I WANT TO SUGGEST IF THEY'RE

00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:44.768
NOT PART OF THE DISCUSSION.

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:47.337
POLICE FATALITIES CAN WIDEN

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:49.606
MISTRUST EVEN MORE WITH THE

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:50.807
COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES WHO SUFFER

00:51:50.874 --> 00:51:52.342
FROM GUN VIOLENCE AND POOR

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:54.511
RELATIONS.

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:55.745
WITH THE POLICE.

00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:57.247
OKAY LET ME -- TRY TO WRAP THIS

00:51:57.314 --> 00:51:59.516
UP HERE I HAVE A COUPLE OF

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:01.852
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS -- THAT

00:52:01.918 --> 00:52:05.155
MAYBE WE CAN CIRCLE BACK TO YOU --

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:07.224
SO THE MESSAGE HERE TODAY THAT

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:08.191
I'VE GIVEN IN THE SHORT AMOUNT

00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:10.160
OF TIME IS THAT POLICE USE OF

00:52:10.227 --> 00:52:11.862
FORCE UNDERMINES TRUST.

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:13.864
AND RESIDENTS THEREFORE SETTLE

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.499
CONFLICT OUTSIDE THE LAW OR

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:18.401
DON'T CALL THEM AT ALL.

00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:20.003
IN THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.438
WOULD BE.

00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:24.241
TO LIMIT POLICE USE OF FORCE.

00:52:24.307 --> 00:52:26.209
I KNOW THE BILL PASSED AB THREE

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:26.843
NINETY TWO I THINK WHAT'S GOING

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.311
TO BE IMPORTANT IS TO LOOK AT

00:52:28.378 --> 00:52:30.347
HOW THIS IS ENFORCED WE SAW THAT

00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:33.083
SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE PASSED

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:34.017
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE.

00:52:34.084 --> 00:52:35.752
TRANSPARENCY TO THE POLICE BUT

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:37.053
NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.855
RECORDS TO FIND OUT WHAT KIND OF

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:41.057
POLICE MISCONDUCT HAS OCCURRED

00:52:41.124 --> 00:52:42.626
SO IT'S NOT JUST PASSING THE LAW.

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:45.262
BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:45.929
THREE NINETY TWO THAT I THINK IS

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:46.763
GOING TO BE CRITICAL.

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.498
SECOND POLICY RECOMMENDATION IS

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:50.534
TO HAVE MORE DEMOCRATICALLY

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.435
CONTROLLED POLICING.

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:54.271
AND POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY VIA

00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:57.941
ENHANCE COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION.

00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.276
AND THEN THE THIRD THING THAT I

00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:01.778
WOULD RECOMMEND IS MORE FUNDING

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.680
FOR PROGRAMS SUCH AS CAST OF

00:53:03.747 --> 00:53:04.581
THESE ARE VIOLENCE INTERVENTION

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:08.652
PROGRAMS -- TO BUILD TRUST FOR

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:10.687
THE TO BUILD TRUST BETWEEN THE

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:11.955
COMMUNITY AND THE POLICE.

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:13.356
AND THEN THE LAST THING I WANT

00:53:13.423 --> 00:53:14.691
TO SAY TO KIND OF WRAP IT UP.

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:17.294
IS WE NEED MORE FUNDING FOR GUN

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.963
VIOLENCE RESEARCH THE FOCUS IS

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.932
NOT JUST ON GUN VIOLENCE BUT HOW

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:23.066
IT AFFECTS.

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:25.001
BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES ARE

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:27.971
IS RESEARCH THE PEOPLE -- JUMP

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:30.006
ON WHEN THERE'S A MASS SHOOTING.

00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:32.275
OF VOTE IN THEIRS THE LARGE

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:33.376
AMOUNT OF GUN RIGHTS AS IN

00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:34.477
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT

00:53:34.544 --> 00:53:37.113
LARGELY GOES IGNORED ON A DAILY

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.748
BASIS AND THAT SHOULD BE A

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:40.350
PRIMARY FOCUS.

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:41.618
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:42.619
DOCTOR MARTIN IS A VERY

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:45.055
INFORMATIVE PRESENTATION --

00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:46.723
QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.191
FOCUSED ON WAS THERE IS A SECOND

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:48.825
WILL MEADOW VIEW AND DAHLE PASO

00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:52.195
HEIGHTS.

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:53.830
SO IF YOU GO BACK. FOR FORTY OR

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:55.966
FIFTY YEARS RIGHT THAT IS BEEN

00:53:56.032 --> 00:53:57.968
THE SAME IN ALL THE AREAS.

00:53:58.034 --> 00:53:59.669
THEY PLAY PRETTY MUCH BEEN

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:01.137
PROVERBS FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:04.641
SO WE HAVE NUMBERS FROM SAN

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:05.308
DIEGO FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE THEM

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:07.410
FROM THE CORNERS OFFICE HAVE YOU

00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:09.079
HAVE YOU GONE BACK THOSE AREAS

00:54:09.145 --> 00:54:10.647
THAT WERE SEVERELY IMPACTED. TO

00:54:10.714 --> 00:54:12.082
SEE WITH THOSE NUMBER WORK

00:54:12.148 --> 00:54:13.416
NUMBERS WERE BACK THEN.

00:54:13.483 --> 00:54:15.785
THERE'S THERE'S A HISTORY OF LOW

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:17.787
TRUST.

00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:19.422
IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ME I

00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:20.657
THINK WE'RE JUST SORT OF

00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:21.992
STARTING TO SEE THROUGH SOCIAL

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:24.461
MEDIA WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE.

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:27.197
BUT IT'S EXISTED. FOR A LONG

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:29.099
TIME AND I THINK NOW WITH SOCIAL

00:54:29.165 --> 00:54:30.400
MEDIA.

00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:32.869
IT'S SORT OF SHEDDING LIGHT ON

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:35.372
HOW EXTENSIVE THE PROBLEM REALLY

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:36.773
IS FAR AS NUMBERS GO SO.

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.975
DO YOU THINK I I AGREE WITH A

00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:41.811
LOT OF YOUR POINTS THAT YOU SAID

00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:43.113
HERE BUT ALSO.

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:44.714
WHEN IT COMES DOWN THOSE AREAS

00:54:44.781 --> 00:54:46.449
ARE SO IMPOVERISHED RIGHT?

00:54:46.516 --> 00:54:48.284
WHAT THE POLITICIANS DONE TO

00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:50.220
HELP WITH THAT THAT TO ME THAT

00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:51.287
PLAYS A PART IN IT TOO NOT

00:54:51.354 --> 00:54:52.989
INVEST THOSE COMMUNITIES WHEN

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:54.157
THE SCHOOLS ARE IN PERFORMING?

00:54:54.224 --> 00:54:56.326
I HAVE NO SUPERMARKETS NO BANKS

00:54:56.393 --> 00:54:57.460
NO SPORTS PROGRAMS DOORS

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:58.795
PROGRAMS FOR KIDS.

00:54:58.862 --> 00:55:00.430
THAT THAT PLAYS IN THE FACTOR

00:55:00.497 --> 00:55:01.398
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THAT

00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:03.266
SECOND THE PICTURE YOU ADD

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:03.933
THERE'S OTHER AREAS WE DON'T SEE

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.335
THAT AT WELL THERE IS A WILL

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:06.503
MORE WEALTHIER.

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:11.341
SO IT COMES BACK STILL DO.

00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:12.175
PART IS THAT INCOMING CALL

00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:14.110
ANYTHING ELSE I MEAN WE'VE DONE

00:55:14.177 --> 00:55:14.644
A LOT WE PASSED THROUGH.

00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:15.178
NINETY TWO LIKE I SAID THE

00:55:15.245 --> 00:55:15.779
SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE IS

00:55:15.845 --> 00:55:18.982
STILL WIDE OPEN SO NO ONE SINCE

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:20.316
I'VE BEEN HERE FIVE YEARS AND

00:55:20.383 --> 00:55:20.984
I'VE BEEN SACRAMENTO NO ONE EVER

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:22.485
TALKS ABOUT REVIVING THOSE

00:55:22.552 --> 00:55:23.420
NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:24.054
YES WE WILL BRING YOU READ IT

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.823
OUT DOWN THERE THROWING A TON OF

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:28.024
MONEY DOWNTOWN.

00:55:28.091 --> 00:55:28.625
I WILL SAY NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:30.527
THE PROBLEMS ARE THERE IS ZERO

00:55:30.593 --> 00:55:31.995
MONEY GOING TOWARDS THEIR AND

00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:33.430
THAT'S SOMETHING WE AS DEMOCRATS

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:35.465
WORKS WE'RE SUPERMAJORITY HERE

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:36.900
SIXTY ONE OUT OF EIGHTY ASSEMBLY.

00:55:36.966 --> 00:55:38.201
NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT THAT

00:55:38.268 --> 00:55:39.502
PUTTING MONEY THERE THEY WANNA

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:41.371
PUT MONEY EVERYWHERE ELSE.

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:43.106
EXCEPT RULES NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:44.307
SO I MEAN CAN YOU CAN YOU JUST

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:45.642
ADDRESS THAT PART OF IT YEAH SO

00:55:45.709 --> 00:55:46.810
I MEAN I ONLY HAVE FIFTEEN

00:55:46.876 --> 00:55:48.044
MINUTES I HAD TO FOCUS ON YOUR

00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:49.379
SHIRT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:50.680
WHICH IS THE USE OF FORCE AND

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:52.549
ITS ROLE IN POLICING BUT THERE

00:55:52.615 --> 00:55:52.716
IS.

00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:55.518
RESEARCH AMONG SOCIOLOGISTS I

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.053
GIVE EXAMPLE IN PHILADELPHIA FOR

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.888
EXAMPLE THERE WERE HIGH A

00:55:58.955 --> 00:56:00.890
NUMBERS OF HOMICIDES IN PARTS OF

00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:02.525
PHILADELPHIA THAT HAD.

00:56:02.592 --> 00:56:05.428
ABANDONED EMPTY LOTS AND SO WHAT

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:07.263
PEOPLE STARTED DOING IS -- THEY

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.798
STARTED IN EMBARKING ON

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.300
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PUTTING

00:56:10.366 --> 00:56:12.202
HOUSING PUTTING BUSINESSES IN

00:56:12.268 --> 00:56:15.105
THOSE WANTS AND LO AND BEHOLD.

00:56:15.171 --> 00:56:17.407
OF GUN VIOLENCE WENT DOWN SO

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:19.075
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THERE IS

00:56:19.142 --> 00:56:20.510
SOME RESEARCH TO SHOW THAT IT

00:56:20.577 --> 00:56:22.579
MATTERS IT ABSOLUTELY MATTERS

00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:24.247
AND I THINK THAT HAS BEEN

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:25.849
OVERLOOKED BY A LOT OF GUN

00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:27.751
VIOLENCE RESEARCHERS AND POLICY

00:56:27.817 --> 00:56:29.652
MAKERS AS WELL AND IT HAS TO BE.

00:56:29.719 --> 00:56:30.820
AT THE FOREFRONT AS WELL WE'RE

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:34.824
PUTTING SIX OR FIFTY BILLION

00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:35.859
TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS.

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:36.726
BUT WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:37.827
SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUE OR THE

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:38.728
MIDDLE HEALTH ISSUE THAT'S A BIG

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:41.564
ISSUE I CAN SCRATCH MY KNEE.

00:56:41.631 --> 00:56:42.398
ARGUED A COUGH AND GO TO MED

00:56:42.465 --> 00:56:43.366
CLINIC AND GET FIXED UP OF

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:44.734
SOMEONE'S HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.469
CRISIS THERE'S REALLY NO PLACE

00:56:46.536 --> 00:56:47.904
TO GO.

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:49.439
AND IT THE STATE.

00:56:49.506 --> 00:56:50.774
AND LOCALS DON'T REALLY FUND

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.075
SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT OR

00:56:52.142 --> 00:56:53.476
MENTAL HEALTH WITH THAT.

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:55.478
CAN YOU SPEAK ON THAT.

00:56:55.545 --> 00:56:57.814
SO YES OVER TALKING ABOUT -- GUN

00:56:57.881 --> 00:56:59.949
VIOLENCE YOU KNOW -- THAT THAT

00:57:00.016 --> 00:57:01.284
TENDS TO BE KIND OF A SMALLER

00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:02.485
PERCENT OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN

00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:04.220
GUN VIOLENCE BUT COMMUNITY

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.955
DEVELOPMENT AND SERVICES ARE

00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:07.223
CRITICAL FOR ANY HEALTHY

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:08.658
COMMITTEE THAT'S REALLY.

00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:10.527
I THINK THE ANECDOTE TO IN

00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:12.128
ADDITION TO BUILDING TRUST IS

00:57:12.195 --> 00:57:13.830
BUILDING BUILDING UP HEALTHY

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:15.165
COMMUNITIES SO.

00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:16.733
THAT I THINK ABSOLUTELY -- THERE

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.234
IS SOME RESEARCH THAT SHOWS A

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:19.769
BUILDING COMMUNITIES UP.

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:23.540
OF MAKE SOME MORE RESILIENT.

00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:25.341
TO VIOLENT CRIME AND MAYBE AT

00:57:25.408 --> 00:57:25.909
ANOTHER TIME I CAN COME AND

00:57:25.975 --> 00:57:28.611
SPEAK MORE TO THAT ISSUE BUT I

00:57:28.678 --> 00:57:29.779
ABSOLUTELY AGREE AND AND THERE

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:31.447
IS RESEARCH.

00:57:31.514 --> 00:57:32.749

BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS I

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:21.110
TRIED -- TO CREE SOMETHING

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:22.945

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:39.629
ABOUT FIVE DECADES OR SO AGO WAS

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:41.364
THE FACT THAT.

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:42.932
AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS.

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.034
OF WERE IMPOVERISHED AND THEY

WERE POVERTY PRIMARILY BECAUSE

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:48.671
OF INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM --

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:49.372
PRETTY MUCH IN THE KERNEL

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:50.540
JUSTICE SYSTEM SO ONE OF THE

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:51.541
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE COUPLE

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:52.341
RECOMMENDATIONS THEY TALKED

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:53.743

ALSO TO GET THEM A JOB IS ALL

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.318
ABOUT ECONOMICS WE LIVE IN A

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.286
CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY SO THESE

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:04.987
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN NEED

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:07.790
EMPLOYMENT AND THEY SAID.

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:09.092
IF YOU'RE IN THE PRIMARY.

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:10.460
MARKET WE'RE AS FAR AS MAKING

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:12.028
WAGES YOU'RE GONNA DO OKAY IF

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:13.296

AND THEN OF COURSE THOSE PERSONS

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.402
WHO DON'T MAKE AS MUCH AND DON'T

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:20.103
DO AS WELL.

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:22.105

IS GOING TO FIND THEM.

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:27.643
SO ONE OF THINGS THAT I WAS

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:28.878
LOOKING.

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:30.246

SIXTY EIGHT IT TALK ABOUT THE

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:37.386
RECOMMENDATIONS WE NEED TO DO

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:38.154
BETTER FOR THESE YOUNG MEN AN

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:40.056
WOMEN IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:41.424
AS WE DID HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:42.525
BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.327
WITH THE MASTER PLAN WHICH IS

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:45.962
WHY COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:47.630
A WHILE AGO WERE FREE -- THEY

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.866
ALSO TALK ABOUT AGAIN EMPLOYMENT

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.667
SOLD RECOMMENDATIONS WERE TO

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:53.503
FIND THESE FOLKS ARE JOB

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:54.871
PARTICULARLY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:55.805
TO GIVE THEM A JOB IN LAW

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:57.473
ENFORCEMENT THE LIKELIHOOD OF

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.142
ANOTHER PERSON OR PERSONS OF

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.576
COLOR.

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:02.345
BEING INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:03.746
ACTIVITY IS GONNA LESSEN BECAUSE

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:05.548
THE ALL THE ARTICLE OR SOME OF

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.083
THE REPORT ALSO TALKED ABOUT AN

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:09.452
OCCUPATION OF ARM -- OFFICERS

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:10.987
PARTICULARLY -- WHITE OFFICERS

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:12.588
WERE INVOLVED IN PRIMARILY --

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:13.990
RACING AT THE MINORITY --

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:15.825
NEIGHBORHOODS TO SAY WE NEED TO

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:17.093
DO SOMETHING AGAIN TO DEFUSE THE

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.427
TENSIONS WE NEED TO CREATE

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:19.996
GREATER DIVERSITY WILL ALSO NEED

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.664
TO CREATE A GREATER PUBLIC IMAGE

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:22.565
THOSE OF THE MAIN

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:23.566
RECOMMENDATIONS THEY TALKED

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:24.267
ABOUT.

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:25.301
BUT MANY OFFICES BACK IN THE

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:27.270
PAST TALKED ABOUT IS NOT OUR

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:28.471
PROBLEM NOW IS THE MANTRA WE

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:29.739
CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ARE

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.507
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PROPERTY

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:33.242
WHEN A RESPONSE OF RADICALISM.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:37.146
WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE -- FOR

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:37.613
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THOSE

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:37.947
COMMUNITIES.

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:38.347
SO.

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:39.448
I STARTED LOOKING AT FROM THAT

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:40.616
ASPECT OF HOW I WAS GOING TO

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:42.018
CREATE THE PROGRAM SO I STARTED

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:45.154
TALKING -- TO MANY OF MY

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:47.523
STUDENTS -- AND AND I WAS WONDER

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.492
WHY THEY WERE NOT GETTING JOBS.

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:51.160
IN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:52.528
WEREN'T GETTING JOBS WAS THAT.

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:54.530
THOSE WHO TRIED THEY STILL

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:55.765
DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD GRASP OF THE

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:57.633
LAW THE LEGAL SYSTEM THE LAW

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.234
ENFORCEMENT A CARAMEL JUSTICE

01:03:58.301 --> 01:03:59.168
COMMUNITY.

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:00.670
SO LOOK TO THAT SAME WE NEED TO

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.004
DO A LOT BETTER WE NEED TO NOT

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:03.005
JUST HAVE THEM GO THROUGH THE

01:04:03.072 --> 01:04:04.473
CLASSES THEN TRY TO APPLY TO

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.608
BECOME AN OFFICER.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:06.676
THEN THERE LACK IN CERTAIN

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:08.477
SKILLS ALSO TALKED TO OFFICERS

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:10.880
ARE ALSO ON THE DEPARTMENT

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:11.514
CURRENTLY ON THE DEPARTMENT THEY

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:12.081
TALKED ABOUT.

01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:14.317
OF THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ARE

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:15.551
NOT READY OR PREPARE FOR THE

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:17.787
RIGORS OF THE JOB -- THEY MAY

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:18.988
PASSED THE CLASSES THEY STILL

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.523
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WERE THE

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.124
IMPORTANT SOCIAL AND CULTURAL

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:23.526
THINGS HAPPENING.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:24.594
IN LHASA TALK TO ME IN THE

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.928
COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THEY WERE

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.029
TELLING ME THAT THE OFFICES IT

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:31.033
DID PASS AND DO WELL.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.134
THEY DO NOT HAVE CULTURAL

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:32.969
COMPETENCY ONE OF THINGS I LIKE

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.704
TO SAY THEY DIDN'T HAVE NOT HAVE

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:36.138
THE CULTURE HUMILITY.

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:38.007
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:40.176
CULTURAL AND EMOTIONAL ASPECTS

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:41.410
OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR PERSONS

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:43.079
PARTICULAR OF COLOR -- TO

01:04:43.145 --> 01:04:44.213
WORKING THERE SO THAT THAT'S

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.548
WERE PRETTY MUCH GOT THE IMPETUS

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:46.816
TO CREATE THE PROGRAM THAT I

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:48.684
HAVE TODAY SO WHAT THE LAW FOR

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:50.253
SOME KIND OF SCHOLARS PROGRAM IS.

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:52.622
IT IS A A PATHWAY PROGRAM TO

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:54.423
CREATE GREATER ACCESS AND

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.959
AWARENESS. TO THESE YOUNG FOLKS

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:58.961
SO CREATED A COMBINATION OF TENT

SHE WILL TEST THEM ON HOW TO

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:15.077
PASS THE EXAM WE HAVE LEADERS

FROM ALL OVER THE STATE OF

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:17.213
CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.014
TO COME IN AND TELL THEM ABOUT

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.482
THE NOBILITY OF POLICING AND

01:05:19.548 --> 01:05:20.583
WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:21.984
AND WHAT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF LAW

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:23.419
ENFORCEMENT IS MONEY MANY OF

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:24.854
THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN THAT

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.788
IDEA WITH PARTICULARLY IN

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:27.123
COLLEGE BUT ALSO GO TO THE HIGH

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:28.257
SCHOOLS.

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:31.093
AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AS WELL.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.195
THEY'VE GOTTEN A SOME SOMEWHAT

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:34.463
OF THE NOT THE GREAT THE

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:36.032
GREATEST NEAR TO THE LAW FOR SIN

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:37.466
AS YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HEAR.

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:39.101
SO IF YOU ASK MANY PEOPLE AND

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:40.369
REYES WHETHER MINORITY COMMUTE

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:42.405

IMPACT THEM AS BEST I CAN TO

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:53.449

01:05:58.988 --> 01:05:59.955
WHEN I ATTENDED?

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:01.590
SOME SCHOOLS IN THE PAST ONE OF

01:06:01.657 --> 01:06:03.159
THE THINGS I TALKED AS YOUNG MEN

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:04.694

8090% OF CLASS RAISE OUR HANDS

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:12.868
BUT THEN I ASK THEM HOW MANY OF

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:14.236
YOU HAVE BEEN APPROACHED BY A

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:16.205

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:25.915
NOTHING AFTER THAT.

01:06:25.981 --> 01:06:27.350
AND THIS IS WHAT THE PROGRAM

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:28.684
DOES IT CONNECTS.

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:31.320
THESE YOUNG FOLKS TO MAKE THEM

WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AS ONE

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:05.020
OF THINGS WE DO WE WORK ON A LOT

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:17.833
DISADVANTAGES WHETHER THEY BE

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.301
SOCIAL CULTURAL ADVANTAGES

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:20.236

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS ATKINS --

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:56.906
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HISTORY WE

01:07:56.972 --> 01:07:59.074
SHOULD DEFINITELY GET DEEPER

01:07:59.141 --> 01:08:00.443
INTO THE HISTORY OF POLICING?

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:02.211
IN AMERICA FIRST ALL LIKE TO SAY

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:03.546
THAT POLICING IN AMERICA.

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:07.082
IS A PUBLIC EPIDEMIC OF KILLING.

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:09.985
OF GENOCIDE ALL OF ONE WARRANTED

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:12.855
ARRESTS -- BIAS.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:18.794
pGUILTY.

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:19.962
BOB OFFICERS THAT KILL.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:22.031
BLACK PEOPLE.

01:08:22.097 --> 01:08:24.066
THIS LABEL TROLL.

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:25.534
IF WE LOOK AT OUR HISTORY THE

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:26.969
SLAVE PATROL WAS ORGANIZED AN

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:28.304
ORGANIZED GROUP OF WHITE MEN WHO

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.505
MONITORED AND ENFORCED

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:32.141
DISCIPLINE UPON BLACK SLAVES.

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:34.577
THEIR MAIN FUNCTION WAS POLICE

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:35.811
THE SLAVING FOR SLAVE COLDS

01:08:35.878 --> 01:08:36.812
PREVENT.

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:39.348
LARGE GATHERINGS INSTALL FEAR

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:40.649
AND CATCH ONE WAYS.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:43.853
SLEEPER TROLLS LED DIRECTLY INTO

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:45.387
THE KKK.

01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:48.257
AND NOW AS WE SEE OR MARTIN DAY.

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:49.859
POLICE SYSTEM.

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:51.861
SEOUL IF WE'RE GOING TO DIVE

01:08:51.927 --> 01:08:54.029
INTO THE HISTORY OF POLICING

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:55.831
LET'S NOT FORGET THE ORIGIN OF

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:57.366
POLICING AND I THINK THAT'S

01:08:57.433 --> 01:09:00.469
WHERE WE KIND TO DEFER.

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:02.805
IN A SENSE OF UNDERSTANDING THAT.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.940
TRAINING.

01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:06.709
OVER AND OVER AND HAVING A

01:09:06.775 --> 01:09:08.410
DIVERSE POLICE FORCE WOULD ALL

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:10.913
OF A SUDDEN CREATE THIS CHANGE

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:12.681
WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT.

01:09:12.748 --> 01:09:14.517
WE'VE HEARD IT OVER AND OVER

01:09:14.583 --> 01:09:16.485
AGAIN MATTER OF FACT A LOT OF

01:09:16.552 --> 01:09:18.120
OUR FUNDING GOALS INTO EXTRA

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:19.188
POLICE TRAINING.

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:20.723
AND TO NO AVAIL.

01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:22.091
AS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE MORE

01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:24.560
BLACK BODIES LAY DOWN DEAD IN

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.095
THE STREET.

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:27.696
SO I ASKED THIS QUESTION WHAT IS

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.532
REALLY TRAINING.

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:31.767
AND WHO WAS DOING THE TRAINING.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:34.036
AND WHY DO WE CONSIDER TO THINK

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:37.139
THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:39.074
BLACK OFFICERS THINGS WILL

01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:40.042
CHANGE.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.545
I POINT THIS DIRECTION BECAUSE

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:45.881
EVERY TIME. FIVE I'VE WOKEN UP.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.683
IN THE LAST WEEK.

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.219
I'VE HEARD THIS THING.

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:52.121
AND IT CONFUSES ME.

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:55.124
IT SAYS A BLUE LIVES MATTER.

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.825
SO THAT RIGHT THERE PARTICULARLY

01:09:56.892 --> 01:09:59.428
TELLS ME THAT ANY OFFICER BLACK

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:01.297
WHITE OR IN DIFFERENT WHO PUTS

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:02.665
ON A UNIFORM.

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:04.767
IS NOW CONSIDERED A BLUE LIFE IS

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:06.635
NO LONGER CONSIDERED A BLACK MAN

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:09.238
OR BLACK WOMEN OR LATINO MAN A

01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:11.040
LATINO WOMAN THEY'RE CONSIDERED

01:10:11.106 --> 01:10:11.907
BLUE.

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:13.208
AND THIS SAME NOTION OF BLUE

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:15.110
LIVES MATTER CAME IN A DIRECT

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:16.912
CORRELATION OF ATTACKING THE

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:19.448
MOVEMENT A CAMPAIGN THAT SAID

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:21.884
BLACK LIVES MATTER BECAUSE BLACK

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:23.686
LIVES MATTER BUT IT WAS NOT

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:25.921
BEING SHOWN ACROSS AMERICA WHEN.

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:28.424
NUMEROUS KILLINGS ACROSS THE

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:29.825
COUNTRY WHAT'S HAPPENING.

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:34.563
FROM THE TIME OF TWO THOUSAND

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:35.097
FOURTEEN TO CURRENTLY IN.

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:35.764
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO WHEN WE

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.700
DECIDE TO HAVE THE REAL

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:39.735
CONVERSATION ABOUT POLICING IN

01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:41.403
AMERICA LET'S GO BACK TO OUR

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:43.105
HISTORY.

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:46.275
POLICE WERE CONSIDERED SLAVE

01:10:46.342 --> 01:10:49.211
PATROL ACHEI A SLAVE CATCHERS.

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:51.113
THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED AS BLACK

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.481
PEOPLE.

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:53.882
BY THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN TO BE

01:10:53.949 --> 01:10:56.018
TARGETS.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:58.087
NO KIND OF TRAINING.

01:10:58.153 --> 01:10:59.021
CAN DEVELOP THE CHANGEABLE

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:01.390
CULTURE.

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:02.658
FILLED WITH BIAS.

01:11:02.725 --> 01:11:05.728
PREJUDICE AND LED BY CERTAIN

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:07.863
STEREO TYPES SO YOU CAN BE A

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.198
BLACK MAN TRAINING.

01:11:09.264 --> 01:11:10.466
YOU COULD BE A BLACK POLICE

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:12.234
OFFICER BUT AS SOON AS YOU PUT

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:13.535
THAT BACK I JOIN YOU CONSIDER TO

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:15.137
BE BLUE.

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:18.374
AS A BLUE LIFE WHO LOSES THEIR

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.443
LIFE IN THE CALL OF THEIR DUTY.

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:23.479
IS CONSIDERED A HERO.

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:25.581
NOT MATTER IN IF THEY HAVE BEEN

01:11:25.648 --> 01:11:27.850
WORKING IN THE FIELD FOR TWO

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:31.353
WEEKS OR BEEN A A A A PRODUCTIVE

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:34.590
OFFICER FOR TWENTY YEARS.

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:35.691
THEY'RE CONSIDERED A HERO.

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:37.526
BUT WHEN A BLACK LIFE IS TOOK IT

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:40.262
AWAY BY A POLICE OFFICER FOR

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:42.865
KNOLL REASON WHATSOEVER BECAUSE

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:45.567
OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN.

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:46.568
AUTOMATICALLY IN MEDIA.

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:49.238
BECAUSE OF WHAT THE POLICE HAVE

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:50.973
NOW REPORTED TO MEDIA OR

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.841
WHATEVER THE MEDIA DECIDES TO

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:53.809
PUT OUT THEY ARE CALLED.

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:56.345
CRIMINALS.

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:57.479
AND THEIR SUSPECTS.

01:11:57.546 --> 01:12:00.049
WHAT IN ONE REGARD ON OFFER

01:12:00.115 --> 01:12:01.550
SERVERS ALWAYS CALL THE HERO?

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:03.352
AND EVEN OFFER SO WE DON'T EVEN

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:05.454
KNOW IF THEY REALLY WERE HERE --

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:06.155
IN OUR COMMUNITY.

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:08.557
SO WHEN WE LOOK.

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:11.126
AND WE WE CHALLENGED THESE IDEAS

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:13.262
THESE CONTENT IDEAS OF TRAINING

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:15.130
MORE TRAINING DIVERSE CITY

01:12:15.197 --> 01:12:17.566
DIVERSE CITY WE HAVE PLENTY.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:19.635
BLACK POLICE CHIEFS.

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:22.004
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE BLACK MARKS.

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:23.272
AND IF WE LOOK AND SAY

01:12:23.338 --> 01:12:23.572
[inaudible]

01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:25.274
WELL.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.710
MAYBE IN BALTIMORE.

01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:29.211
THAT HAS A BLACK POLICE CHIEF

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:30.979
THERE WEREN'T THAT MANY MURDERS

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:33.115
OF BLACK PEOPLE I CHALLENGE THE

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.316
FACT THAT.

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:36.418
ANY MURDER OF A BLACK PERSON ON

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:39.655
ARM IS MORE THAN WE NEED THERE

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:42.458
SHOULD NOT BE ONE MURDER.

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:43.392
SO THE FACT THAT WE ARE

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:45.394
CHALLENGING OURSELVES A FIGURE

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:48.163
THAT WE'VE HAD LESS.

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:50.299
MURDERS IN CERTAIN CITIES AND

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:51.800
APPLAUDING OURSELVES IS

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:54.002
RIDICULOUS.

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:55.904
IT'S FRUSTRATING AND IT ANGERS

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:57.606
ME THAT WE HAVE JUST

01:12:57.673 --> 01:12:58.907
CONTINUOUSLY HAD THESE

01:12:58.974 --> 01:13:01.710
COMMITTEES THESE CONVERSATIONS

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:04.680
AND ONE THING HASN'T BEEN DONE.

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:07.082
WHEN POLICE VIOLATE THE COLDER

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:08.183
PROTECTING AND SERVING WHEN THE

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:09.384
POLICE?

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:11.687
USED EXCESSIVE FORCE WHEN POLICE

01:13:11.754 --> 01:13:13.822
DO NOT HAVE THEIR BODY CAMERAS

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:17.593
INDIVIDUALS THIRTY SOME ODD

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.995
TIMES AND DON'T HAVE A REAL

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:21.330
REASON OF WHY THEY SHOT AN

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:23.766
UNARMED BLACK PERSON THIRTY ALL

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:24.767
TIMES.

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:27.336
WE HAVE THAT POLICE OFFICER

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:29.304
CONTINUING TO WALK OUR STREETS.

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:31.740
WE HAVE NO GUILTY VERDICTS.

01:13:31.807 --> 01:13:34.743
WE HAVE NO TRANSPARENCY.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:36.478
AND POLICE RARELY SEE A NIGHT IN

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:38.547
JAIL.

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:40.349
THE FUNNY THING IS POLICE

01:13:40.415 --> 01:13:42.584
ACTUALLY GET CELEBRATED WHEN

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:44.953
THEY'RE KILLED ON ON OFFICER

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.789
THEY GET GOAL FUNDING THESE.

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:48.657
DAVE BASICALLY HAVE BEEN TOLD

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:50.125
THAT THEY ARE HEROES AND THEY

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:51.260
DID THE RIGHT THING THEY PUT

SERVE THEM BE PROTECTED THE

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:54.062
COMMUNITY.

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:56.131
THE SAME COMMUNITY THAT THESE

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:59.201
POLICE OFFICERS CONTINUE

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:01.670
[inaudible] TO REGULATE.

01:14:01.737 --> 01:14:03.906
CONTINUE TO TERRORIZE.

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:04.907
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DEALING

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:06.074
WITH IS POLICE TERROR IN OUR

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:07.643
COMMUNITIES.

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:09.778
AS I'VE WORKED WITH.

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:12.080

SHE HAS NO IDEA.

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:31.300
AND FOR HER TO WATCH

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:31.600
[inaudible]

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:32.901
THE CELEBRATING [inaudible]

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:35.537
THIS OFFICER.

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:36.138
WHO WAS KILLED IN THE LINE OF

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:38.407

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:40.509
ED FOR HER SON.

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:48.617
SUSPECT.

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:50.786
AND OUR SON CAN NEVER COME BACK.

01:14:50.853 --> 01:14:52.754
I THINK ABOUT A MARSHALL MILES.

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:55.324
WHOSE MOTHER PLAYED.

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:57.860

BROUGH REALIZE IN HIS CELL IS

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.143
THIS WHAT WE CALL GOOD TRAINING.

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:17.145
THIRTY SECONDS I THINK ABOUT

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:17.446
[inaudible]

01:15:17.512 --> 01:15:20.082
STEFAN CLARK.

01:15:20.148 --> 01:15:21.516
GOING BACK HOME TO HIS

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:23.585
GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE.

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:25.120
BEING CALLED A SUSPECT IN BEING

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.923

DEFICIT UP ON CLARK I THINK

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:49.444
ABOUT BRANDON SMITH.

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:51.413

MANDATORY DRUG TESTING TWO

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:26.548
POLICE OFFICERS WHO USE THEIR

OF THIS TIME.

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:31.980
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:33.148
PICTURES.

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:36.018
IT WAS POLICE WHO WAS OFTENTIMES

SO TO CULTURAL POLICING IS NOT

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:44.493
BEING TALKED ABOUT A POLICE ARE

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:46.461
NOT BEING TRAINED ON THEIR OWN

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:47.496
CULTURE.

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:48.997
I WAS ACTUALLY WANTED PEOPLE WHO

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:51.366

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:56.738
HE WAS WITH ME MY YOUNGER

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:57.939
BROTHER AND I BY SOME NOT TO

01:17:58.006 --> 01:17:58.874
TALK TO THE POLICE BECAUSE WHEN

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:01.043
YOU SAY THINGS SOMETIMES THE USE

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:01.443
THAT AGAINST YOU.

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.578
IN A COURT OF LAW BUT HE CAME

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:04.913
OUT HE KEPT TRYING TO EDUCATE

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.615
THE POLICE ON WILL YOU KNOW THE

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:08.216
THE ORIGINS OF POLICE ARE RIGHT.

01:18:08.283 --> 01:18:09.551
YOU KNOW THAT YOU STARTED AS

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:11.053
LAKE CATCHES YOU NOTICE COOL AND

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:13.522
THE POLICE WERE OBLIVIOUS TO

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:14.790
THIS KNOWLEDGE.

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:15.924
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:18.226
FOUNDATION OF POLICING.

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:18.994
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:21.029
HISTORY OF THEIR RELATIONS

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:23.131
WITHIN BLACK COMMUNITIES AND

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:24.466
BROWN COMMUNITIES.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:27.969
SO WHERE BLACK PEOPLE REAL

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:29.337
PEOPLE TRUST THE POLICE.

01:18:29.404 --> 01:18:29.971
WHAT ARE THE POLICE LOOKING AT

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:32.040
IT IS ALWAYS A NEGATIVE CULTURE?

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:32.607
DON'T HAVE A CULTURE OF NOT

01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:35.644

MANDATORY TRAINING ON YOUR

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:41.516
CONTRIBUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:43.819
NOW I REALLY APPRECIATE IT WOULD

01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:44.853
THAT THE MARTINEZ SAID TO SAY

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:45.387
BECAUSE HE BROUGHT UP SOME

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.955
REALLY GOOD POINTS.

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:48.723
SOME OF WEEKS.

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:49.825
HE TALKED ABOUT.

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.026
GUN VIOLENCE REALLY BEING A

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:53.261
PRODUCT THE LOW RESOURCES

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:55.163
ALCOHOL DRUG ABUSE -- POOR

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:57.332

RELATIONS AND MENTAL HEALTH.

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:00.936
AND SO AGAIN WE FOLLOW THE

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:03.605
TIMELINE AND WE LOOK AT THE

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:04.940
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICE AND

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:06.141
COMMUNITY.

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.343
GUN VIOLENCE WITH THEIR POLICE

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.312

01:19:18.787 --> 01:19:21.022
RELATIONSHIP WITH BLACK AND

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:22.757

WHATEVER OF CULT AND I'M SURE

01:27:26.708 --> 01:27:27.675
THE SAME THING HAPPEN TO YOU TOO

SO YOU HAVE A ROLE I HAVE I'M

01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:33.114
TRYING TO DO WITH OTHERS AS WELL

01:27:33.181 --> 01:27:34.382

01:27:34.449 --> 01:27:36.951
THESE YOUNG MEN TO DO THE RIGHT

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:38.019
THING SO THE CHIEF.

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:39.287
HIS POLICIES ARE HER POLICIES

01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:40.855
AND THEN IT'S THE RANK AND FILE

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:42.156
THE RANK AND FILE DO WHATEVER

01:27:42.223 --> 01:27:43.224
THE CHIEF SAYS.

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:45.927
SO IF WE CAN CHANGE THE CULTURE

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:48.029
OF THE CHIEF OKAY AND GET HIM

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:50.765
NOT MY PROBLEM.

01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:51.666
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.034
THE DATA THAT WE HEARD FROM --

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:55.436
DOCTOR MARTINEZ AND OTHERS TO

01:27:55.503 --> 01:27:56.971
TELL ABOUT THEIR STORES NO ONCE

01:27:57.038 --> 01:27:58.640
ELIMINATE THE STORES THAT'S NOT

01:27:58.706 --> 01:27:59.741
THE POINT THE POINT IS TO SAY

01:27:59.807 --> 01:28:01.242
WHAT WE DO WITH THIS INFORMATION

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:02.477
HOW WE'RE GONNA GO FOR IT AND

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:03.411
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:05.013
WITH THE PROGRAM THAT'S WHY SAID

01:28:05.079 --> 01:28:06.914
WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL THUS FAR

01:28:06.981 --> 01:28:09.050
BECAUSE THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THEY

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:09.917
COULD THEY READ THESE YOUNG

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:12.420
PEOPLE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:12.854
TWENTY YEARS OF AGE.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.088
THEY COULD EASILY SAY.

01:28:14.155 --> 01:28:15.623
I DON'T LIKE HOPS WITH THESE

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:16.691
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE

01:28:16.758 --> 01:28:18.026
COME FROM LOW ECONOMIC

01:28:18.092 --> 01:28:19.494
BACKGROUNDS MOST IN THE IN THE

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.095
PROGRAM THEY SAID.

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.563
I WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:23.231
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO

01:28:23.297 --> 01:28:24.766
IS CHANGE THE OUTCOME AND HOPE

01:28:24.832 --> 01:28:27.068
AND THEY DO THE SAME THING.

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:27.635
WHO YOU TRYING TO CHANGE THE

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:28.803
OUTCOME?

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:29.103
FOR I'M NOT.

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:30.605
I'M JUST SAYING.

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:32.273
I JUST I KNOW I I KEEP WE KEEP

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.808
ON HEARING THE SAME KINDA LIKE.

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:34.942
IT'S GOING BACK TO TRAINING

01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:37.145
TRAINING TRAINING THE OUTCOME

01:28:37.211 --> 01:28:38.680
HAS TO BE.

01:28:38.746 --> 01:28:41.015
OUR MY BOTTOM LINE SOLUTION IS

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:43.251
YOU HAVE TO FIRE THE OFFICERS --

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:44.986
WHEN THEY'RE BEING TRAINED THEY

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:46.254
HAVE TO KNOW?

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.722
THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN POLICY OF

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:49.857
YOU BREAK YOU WILL GET FIRED YOU

01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:51.192
GET TERMINATED.

01:28:51.259 --> 01:28:52.960
AND THAT'S NOT BEING DONE

01:28:53.027 --> 01:28:53.861
BECAUSE OF THE POWERFUL POLICE

01:28:53.928 --> 01:28:55.596
UNION BECAUSE THE POLICE BILL OF

01:28:55.663 --> 01:28:57.165
RIGHTS THESE THINGS THAT ARE IN

01:28:57.231 --> 01:28:58.800
PLACE THIS POLICIES THAT ARE IN

01:28:58.866 --> 01:29:00.668
PLACE THAT PROTECT POLICE.

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:02.036
SO WE KEEP ON TALKING ABOUT

01:29:02.103 --> 01:29:04.105
TRYING TO TRAIN PEOPLE TO NOT BE

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:05.073
RACIST.

01:29:05.139 --> 01:29:07.709
TRYING TO REPROGRAM A CULTURE

01:29:07.775 --> 01:29:09.243
THAT HAVE PROBABLY BEEN THERE

01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:11.579
BEFORE CHIEF WE HAD ARMED POLICE

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:14.348
SUMMERS THAT WAS HERE BEFORE --

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:16.150
CHIEF HAN WAS HERE CHIEF HAN

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:17.952
JUST CAME INTO ANOTHER QUOTE TO

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:20.588
ARE THE CULTURAL SUMMERS HE HAS

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:22.590
TO TAKE YEARS TO CREATE THE

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:24.125
CULTURE HE'S TRYING TO IDENTIFY

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.893
WHICH THE REALITY IS WHAT WE'RE

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:26.694
DEALING WITH.

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:28.529
IS IF THERE IS NO ALL

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:30.832
CONSEQUENCES POLICE CONTINUE TO

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:31.933
RUN ROLE.

01:29:31.999 --> 01:29:33.935
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE WE HAD A

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:35.470
LAW THAT WOULD BE THE PLACE FOR

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:38.106
THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHO

01:29:38.172 --> 01:29:40.942
ARE THE OFFICERS THAT HAVE HAD --

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:42.844
YOU'LL MISCONDUCT AND IT WAS A

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:44.412
FIGHT FOR EVEN THAT TO COME OUT

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:45.913
AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:47.181
BEING PLACED IN LAW FORGET WHAT

01:29:47.248 --> 01:29:48.249
THE LAW WAS.

01:29:48.316 --> 01:29:49.717
BUT IT WAS JUST PASSED LAST YEAR

01:29:49.784 --> 01:29:51.519
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE

01:29:51.586 --> 01:29:54.789
OFFICERS THAT HAD MISCONDUCT ON

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:58.893
THAT WERE MISPLACED WITH THIS

01:29:58.960 --> 01:29:59.093
THAT.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.028
I FORGET.

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:01.696
OKAY YOU SAID THANK YOU SO THESE

01:30:01.763 --> 01:30:02.363
KIND OF THINGS WHEN YOU HAVE A A

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:04.866
WHOLE COLLECTION OF OFFICERS

01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:05.867
THROUGHOUT AMERICA NOT JUST HERE

01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:08.503
IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE WILLING

01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:10.204
TO PROTECT THEIR OWN.

01:30:10.271 --> 01:30:12.240
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SERVICE

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:13.775
SINGING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:30:13.841 --> 01:30:15.510
BETTER TRAINING THIS IS NOT

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:17.411
GOING TO WORK IT'S EASY FOR

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:19.080
POLICE OFFICER TO TO GIVE OUT

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:21.115
TURKEYS AT ON THANKSGIVING IT'S

01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:22.884
EASY FOR POLICE OFFICERS TO GIVE

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:24.952
OUT BIKES ON CHRISTMAS WHEN

01:30:25.019 --> 01:30:26.287
THESE KIDS ARE FIVE YEARS OLD.

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:28.589
WHEN THAT KID NOW BECOMES

01:30:28.656 --> 01:30:29.490
THIRTEEN YEARS OLD WHAT ARE WE

01:30:29.557 --> 01:30:30.625
GOING TO DEAL WITH THAT NUMBER

01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:32.493
TO BE PUSHED BACK ON ON

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:33.861
SOMETHING YOU SAID?

01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:35.029

BECAUSE BY YOUR THE OFFICERS

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:40.802
THAT COULD MEET.

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:44.038
VIS A NEUTRAL SHOES THINGS THAT

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:45.306
HAPPEN TO OUR COMMUNITY IF AN

01:30:45.373 --> 01:30:47.842
OFFER SIR HOLD ON IF AN OFFICER

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:49.944

OFFICER KILLS AN UNARMED BLACK

PERSON OR ANY PERSON.

01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:57.051
AND THERE WAS NO THREAT THEY USE

01:30:57.118 --> 01:30:58.419
EXCESSIVE FORCE.

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:00.154
THAT OFFICER SHOULD BE DRUG

01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:01.589
TESTED SO WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:03.424
IN THE OFFICES SYSTEM BECAUSE I

01:31:03.491 --> 01:31:04.492
UNDERSTAND POLICING IS A

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:06.194
DIFFICULT DO WE WE HAVE OFFICES

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:07.228

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:07.728
SHIPS.

01:31:07.795 --> 01:31:09.363
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ALL

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:10.731
OFFICERS ARE JUST DRINKING

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:12.300
COFFEE SO LIFT.

SHADOW OF DOUBT TO FIGURE OUT

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:18.306
THE MINDSET AND IF THERE WAS NO

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:21.108
REASONABLE RESENTFUL OFFER SIR

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:23.077
FORCE.

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:25.279
THE OFFICER SHOULD BE FAR

01:31:25.346 --> 01:31:26.180
WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT.

01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:29.317
SO A PERSON CAN BE TERMINATED

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:29.951

THERE'S NO MANDATORY THING GOV

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:12.106
OKAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LET

01:35:12.173 --> 01:35:13.607
YOU GO MOST TIMES.

01:35:13.674 --> 01:35:15.543
WE ACTUALLY KEEP GOING TO FORCE

01:35:15.609 --> 01:35:16.777
YOU GET PAID LEAVE THINGS OF

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:18.012
THAT NATURE SO THERE'S NO TYPE

01:35:18.079 --> 01:35:19.046
OF PUNITIVE.

01:35:19.113 --> 01:35:21.582
PUNITIVE CONSEQUENCE FOR IT OR

01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:23.084
NO INCENTIVE I MEAN BECAUSE WHEN

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:25.319
IT COMES TO CREATE SOME TYPE OF

01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:26.754
SOCIAL BEHAVIOR THAT'S DESIRABLE

01:35:26.821 --> 01:35:27.621
THERE'S REALLY TWO WAYS TO LOOK

01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:28.956
AT IT RIGHT YOU CAN CREATE A

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:30.791
SENTENCE TO IT OR YOU CAN CREATE.

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:32.226

SO I THINK THAT TRAINING IS

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.366
IMPORTANT BUT I THINK THAT WHEN

01:35:39.433 --> 01:35:41.368
TRAINING FALL SHORT WE HAVE TO

01:35:41.435 --> 01:35:43.337

ANALYZING THE PROBLEM WITHIN

01:35:51.445 --> 01:35:53.247

ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDES

01:36:45.065 --> 01:36:47.368
LOS ANGELES -- SOME PARTS OF

01:36:47.434 --> 01:36:52.106
INGLEWOOD AND ALL OF CULVER CITY --

01:36:52.173 --> 01:36:54.275
WHY IS THIS ISSUE IMPORTANT TO

01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:57.678
ME AND MY DISTRICT -- WELL IT'S

01:36:57.745 --> 01:37:00.447
IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE I AM THE

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:03.284
WIFE OF A BLACK MAN AND THE STEP

01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:05.753
MOTHER OF TWO BLACK CHILDREN.

01:37:05.819 --> 01:37:09.490
AND I WANT TO SEE THEM GROW OLD

01:37:09.557 --> 01:37:11.091
AND FEEL SAFE.

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:13.194
IN ANY COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:18.032
TRAVEL -- AND FROM WATCHING

01:37:18.098 --> 01:37:20.434
MOVIES ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE FROM

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:24.905
HEARING STORIES -- WHEN I'M AT

01:37:24.972 --> 01:37:27.708
HOME ABOUT VICTIMS OF GUN

01:37:27.775 --> 01:37:29.343
VIOLENCE AND ABOUT THE

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:31.312
RELATIONSHIP THAT ARE BLACK AND

01:37:31.378 --> 01:37:32.780
ARE BROWN AND ARE ASIAN BROTHERS

01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:34.915
HAVE -- WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:37.451
WITH GUNS WE SHOULD BE TALKING

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:39.119
ABOUT IT AND I THINK IT'S

01:37:39.186 --> 01:37:41.355
EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:43.357
ABOUT THOSE SPECIFIC

01:37:43.424 --> 01:37:45.125
RELATIONSHIP.

01:37:45.192 --> 01:37:47.127
THAT BLACK AND BROWN MEN AND

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:48.862
WOMEN IN COMMUNITIES HAVE WITH

01:37:48.929 --> 01:37:53.100
GUNS IN GUN VIOLENCE -- AND THAT

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:54.268
IS BOTH.

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:55.970
AT THE INTERACTION THAT FOLKS

01:37:56.036 --> 01:37:57.638
HAVE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT

01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:59.873
THEN JUST THE INTERACTION WE

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:01.442
HAVE WITH GUNS.

01:38:01.508 --> 01:38:02.443
I TALKED TO FOLKS ALL THE TIME

01:38:02.509 --> 01:38:03.877
BECAUSE WE HAVE AN INORDINATE

01:38:03.944 --> 01:38:05.980
NUMBER OF GUN BILLS THAT COME

01:38:06.046 --> 01:38:07.581
THROUGH PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:09.483
AND PART OF THE CONVERSATION WE

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:10.918
HAVE TO BE HAVING IS IS

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:12.653
INHERENTLY RACIST AND

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.388
DISCRIMINATORY SYSTEM THAT

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:17.057
FOCUSES HEAVILY ON PROFILING.

01:38:17.124 --> 01:38:18.792
AND IT IS VERY HARD TO CREATE

01:38:18.859 --> 01:38:21.462
GOOD POLICY ON TOP OF QUICKSAND.

01:38:21.528 --> 01:38:22.963
AND TO ASSUME THAT THAT GOOD

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:25.099
POLICY IS GOING TO SOMEHOW

01:38:25.165 --> 01:38:27.868
SUPERSEDE THIS INHERENTLY RACIST

01:38:27.935 --> 01:38:30.204
FOUNDATION UPON WHICH WERE

01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:31.338
PLACING THESE NEW LAWS.

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:32.740
AND SO WHY DON'T WE BEGIN TO

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:35.209
UNRAVEL ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND

01:38:35.276 --> 01:38:36.977
HAVE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

01:38:37.044 --> 01:38:40.214
A SPECIFIC VERY GENDER SPECIFIC

01:38:40.281 --> 01:38:41.649
VERY TRAUMA SPECIFIC

01:38:41.715 --> 01:38:44.551
CONVERSATIONS AROUND TRAUMA AND

01:38:44.618 --> 01:38:46.987
VIOLENCE IN COMMUNITIES.

01:38:47.054 --> 01:38:48.289
PEOPLE LIKE TO ASSUME THAT BLACK

01:38:48.355 --> 01:38:49.256
AND BROWN PEOPLE LIKE TO SHOOT

01:38:49.323 --> 01:38:50.924
FOLKS UP EVERY DAY AND EVERY

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:51.959
NIGHT.

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:53.327
BUT I WILL ALSO ARGUE THAT BLACK

01:38:53.394 --> 01:38:54.595
AND BROWN COMMUNITIES ARE SOME

01:38:54.662 --> 01:38:56.497
OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE WHEN IT

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:58.432
COMES TO CERTAIN PRINCIPLES AND

01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:00.267
VALUES SYSTEMS AND SO THERE IS A

01:39:00.334 --> 01:39:02.236
DISCONNECT WITH HOW WE ARE

01:39:02.303 --> 01:39:03.304
TREATED.

01:39:03.370 --> 01:39:05.773
AND HOW WE ARE PROFILED IN HOW

01:39:05.839 --> 01:39:06.974
WE ACTUALLY ACT.

01:39:07.041 --> 01:39:08.075
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE

01:39:08.142 --> 01:39:10.244
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE TREAT

01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:12.079
EACH OTHER AND ABOUT HOW WE

01:39:12.146 --> 01:39:13.414
HANDLE CONFLICT.

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.115
AND HOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRAINED

01:39:15.182 --> 01:39:16.050
TO DO.

01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:17.484
WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD WE SHOULD

01:39:17.551 --> 01:39:20.421
DO AND WHAT IS PART OF WHO WE

01:39:20.487 --> 01:39:21.622
ACTUALLY ARE IN OUR CULTURE AND

01:39:21.689 --> 01:39:22.856
WHAT WE WANT TO DO?

01:39:22.923 --> 01:39:23.957
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE

01:39:24.024 --> 01:39:25.893
THAT WE AS A CULTURE ONE AT A

01:39:25.959 --> 01:39:27.428
RADIC KATE.

01:39:27.494 --> 01:39:28.796
ARE OUR FUTURE.

01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:30.364
BY KILLING.

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:32.700
YOU KNOW OUR NEXT GENERATION WE

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:34.768
ARE FOCUSED NOW ON TRYING TO

01:39:34.835 --> 01:39:35.803
HEAL.

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.371
AND TO MOVE OURSELVES INTO THE

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:39.840
SPOTLIGHT TO SAY WE ARE HERE.

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:41.575
AND WE ARE HOLE.

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:43.510
WE ARE HURTING.

01:39:43.577 --> 01:39:44.645
BUT WE ARE HOLE.

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:46.547
I'M NOT LESS OF A HUMAN BECAUSE

01:39:46.613 --> 01:39:49.917
I'M A BLACK MAN -- SO WHY DON'T

01:39:49.983 --> 01:39:50.951
WE HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:39:51.018 --> 01:39:52.052
VIOLENCE IN BLACK AND BROWN

01:39:52.119 --> 01:39:53.654
COMMUNITIES.

01:39:53.721 --> 01:39:55.456
BECAUSE IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT

01:39:55.522 --> 01:39:57.024
THREE WEEKS AGO A GENTLEMAN IN

01:39:57.091 --> 01:39:59.393
BEL AIR.

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:00.494

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:02.696
THOUSAND GUNS.

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:04.298
IN HIS HOME.

01:40:04.365 --> 01:40:06.533
THAT WAS ON THE NEWS FOR THIRTY

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:08.035
FIVE SECONDS AND THEN NO ONE

01:40:08.102 --> 01:40:09.603
TALKED ABOUT HIM.

01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:11.271
NO ONE TALKED ABOUT THOSE GUNS

01:40:11.338 --> 01:40:12.406
NO ONE TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE WAS

01:40:12.473 --> 01:40:15.209
DOING WITH THEM [inaudible]

01:40:15.275 --> 01:40:17.678
WHY NOT?

01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:19.146

IS BASED IN SAN DIEGO IT HAS

01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:29.710
BROADER IMPLICATIONS FOR THE

STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S A

01:42:31.178 --> 01:42:33.347
LOT OF PARALLELS WHAT WE SEE IN

01:42:33.413 --> 01:42:36.083
SAN DIEGO -- THAT WE SEE AN LOS

01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:38.018

SO STARTING IN THE FALL OF TWO

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:48.362
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I CONDUCTED.

01:42:48.428 --> 01:42:49.796

01:42:49.863 --> 01:42:52.299
DIFFERENT POLICE GAIN UNITS IN

01:42:52.366 --> 01:42:53.667
SAN DIEGO COUNTY THIS IS THE WAY

01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:56.837
THAT I GATHERED MOST OF MY DATA --

01:42:56.904 --> 01:43:00.073
I RODE WITH UNITS FOR ABOUT FOUR

01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:02.142
TO FIVE HOURS ON THURSDAYS AND

01:43:02.209 --> 01:43:03.310
FRIDAYS.

01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:05.445
AND ADDITIONALLY I SPENT CLOSE

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:06.980
TO TWO YEARS OBSERVING THE CITY

01:43:07.047 --> 01:43:08.115
OF SACRAMENTO'S POLICE

01:43:08.181 --> 01:43:09.683
DEPARTMENT GANG UNIT.

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:11.218
RIDING WITH THEM TWO TO THREE

01:43:11.285 --> 01:43:14.021
TIMES PER WEEK EVERY. SIX SIX TO

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:15.822
EIGHT WEEKS I KNOW THE OFFICERS

01:43:15.889 --> 01:43:17.324
ARE THE GANG UNITS PRETTY WELL

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:18.959
HERE IN SACRAMENTO AS WELL.

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:20.994
SO THESE FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS

01:43:21.061 --> 01:43:22.930
OBSERVING PLEASE GANG UNITS

INFORM MY WORK TODAY.

01:43:24.698 --> 01:43:25.899
AND GIVEN THE SEEM OF GUN

01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:27.668
VIOLENCE IN GANGS I THOUGHT IT

01:43:27.734 --> 01:43:33.040
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DISCUSS --

01:43:33.106 --> 01:43:34.641
WHAT MY FINDINGS WERE?

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:35.475
AND WHEN I WAS COLLECTING DATA

01:43:35.542 --> 01:43:35.976
WAS TRYING TO ANSWER TWO

01:43:36.043 --> 01:43:37.044
QUESTIONS.

01:43:37.110 --> 01:43:38.478
THE FIRST QUESTION IS -- WHERE

01:43:38.545 --> 01:43:40.747
DO GUNS COME FROM USED IN

01:43:40.814 --> 01:43:42.883
HOMICIDES OR SHOOTINGS AND

01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:45.185
SECOND WHY DO PEOPLE CARRY THEM

01:43:45.252 --> 01:43:46.620
WHAT ARE THE MOTIVATIONS FOR

01:43:46.687 --> 01:43:47.721
KAREN SO?

01:43:47.788 --> 01:43:48.822
IF THIS SOUNDS FAMILIAR ON

01:43:48.889 --> 01:43:50.057
BUILDING ON THE TALK I GAVE

01:43:50.123 --> 01:43:52.392
EARLIER TALKING ABOUT ACCESS AND

01:43:52.459 --> 01:43:56.029
MEANINGS -- FOR HAVING GUNS --

01:43:56.096 --> 01:43:58.966
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FINDINGS.

01:43:59.032 --> 01:44:01.768
SO -- MY FINDINGS ARE.

01:44:01.835 --> 01:44:04.304
BASED ON PATROL OBSERVATIONS

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:05.706
WERE PART OF THE DATA CAME FROM

01:44:05.772 --> 01:44:07.207
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

01:44:07.274 --> 01:44:08.408
DISCOVERED.

01:44:08.475 --> 01:44:12.579
WAS ABOUT 3240% OF ALL WEAPONS

01:44:12.646 --> 01:44:15.115
RECOVERED FROM SHOOTINGS -- FROM

01:44:15.182 --> 01:44:16.683
SHOOTINGS IN HIGH HOMICIDES WERE

01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:18.251
TRAFFICKED [inaudible]

01:44:18.318 --> 01:44:21.388
FROM ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO SO

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:22.656
HERE ARE MOSTLY TALKING ABOUT

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:24.958
SAN DIEGO -- AND SO THESE ARE

01:44:25.025 --> 01:44:27.194
JUST -- INTERVIEWS I DID WITH

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:28.695
POLICE OFFICERS FROM THE GANG

01:44:28.762 --> 01:44:29.796
UNIT.

01:44:29.863 --> 01:44:31.565
AND I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED TO

01:44:31.632 --> 01:44:33.433
HEAR THAT THAT LARGE PERCENT

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.069
PERCENTAGE OF HAND GUNS CAME

01:44:36.136 --> 01:44:37.304
FROM OUT OF STATE PRIMARILY

01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:41.475
ARIZONA -- THE REMAINING GUNS.

01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:43.744
WERE STOLEN -- AND WEIRD WHEN

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:45.646
WERE TAKEN FROM FAMILY MEMBERS

01:44:45.712 --> 01:44:47.681
WHO OWNED FIREARMS MOST OF THE

01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:49.082
WEAPONS USED WERE SMALL HAND

01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:52.219
GUNS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:44:52.285 --> 01:44:52.819
THIRTY EIGHT TWENTY TWOS FORTY

01:44:52.886 --> 01:44:55.188
FIVES AND NOT TYPICALLY THE

01:44:55.255 --> 01:44:58.358
ASSAULT WEAPONS THAT WE HEAR

01:44:58.425 --> 01:45:01.962
ABOUT IN MASS SHOOTINGS.

01:45:02.029 --> 01:45:03.997
SO SOME OF THE OTHER DAY THE

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:04.665
THAT I HAVE THEM WITH TALK ABOUT

01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:06.066
TODAY WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:08.235
DA'S OFFICE AS WELL AS WE

01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:09.369
ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH SOME OF

01:45:09.436 --> 01:45:11.171
THE THEIR HOMICIDE FILES.

01:45:11.238 --> 01:45:12.939
NOT SO I WAS ABLE TO GET THE THE

01:45:13.006 --> 01:45:14.975
DATA ON THE TYPES OF HANDGUNS

01:45:15.042 --> 01:45:15.709
USE.

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:16.977
SO THE POINT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:45:17.044 --> 01:45:18.478
FIRST IS IT WE SHOULDN'T LOSE

01:45:18.545 --> 01:45:20.914
SIGHT OF THE NEED TO REGULATE

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:23.250
SMALL HAND GUNS SINCE THEY ARE

01:45:23.316 --> 01:45:25.419
LARGELY RESPONSIBLE. FOR MOST

01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:27.788
HOMICIDES BUT THAT STILL BUT IT

01:45:27.854 --> 01:45:28.321
DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T

01:45:28.388 --> 01:45:29.923
REGULATE ASSAULT WEAPONS BUT

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.657
MOST OF THE GUN ONCE IN

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:32.025
COMMITTEES OF COLOR ARE

01:45:32.092 --> 01:45:34.761
COMMITTED BY SMALL HANDGUNS AND

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:35.595
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:38.265
THAT -- MY FINDINGS NEED TO GO

01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:39.566
FURTHER AND WE NEED TO

01:45:39.633 --> 01:45:41.034
INVESTIGATE WE WHAT WE NEED TO

01:45:41.101 --> 01:45:42.536
DO IS INVESTIGATE NOT ONLY THE

01:45:42.602 --> 01:45:44.071
SECONDARY SOURCES.

01:45:44.137 --> 01:45:45.405
BUT THE PRIMARY SOURCES WHEN I

01:45:45.472 --> 01:45:47.274
SAY PRIMARY SOURCES WE NEED TO

01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:50.077
NOTE DIRECTLY WHICH GUN DEALERS.

01:45:50.143 --> 01:45:51.978
IN PLACES LIKE ARIZONA WHERE

01:45:52.045 --> 01:45:53.647
THESE GUNS ARE COMING FROM SO

01:45:53.714 --> 01:45:55.749
THAT WE CAN PROSECUTE -- THOSE

01:45:55.816 --> 01:45:58.218
BUSINESSES FOR SELLING THEM OR

01:45:58.285 --> 01:45:59.653
TRY TO INVESTIGATE HOW THEY

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.555
ENDED UP IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE

01:46:01.621 --> 01:46:05.158
WHO USE THEM -- FOR HOMICIDES.

01:46:05.225 --> 01:46:06.059
SO WHAT MY OBSERVATIONS

01:46:06.126 --> 01:46:08.095
SUGGESTED THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF

01:46:08.161 --> 01:46:10.597
GUNS USED TO COMMIT MURDER IN

01:46:10.664 --> 01:46:13.133
BLACK AND BROWN NEIGHBORHOODS --

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.668
THERE ARE USING GANG RELATED

01:46:14.735 --> 01:46:18.038
ACTIVITY COME FROM OUT OF STATE.

01:46:18.105 --> 01:46:20.307
SO THIS SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A

01:46:20.373 --> 01:46:24.010
NEED FOR FEDERAL POLICY REFORM

01:46:24.077 --> 01:46:27.214
TO DEAL WITH GUN VIOLENCE.

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:29.149
SO -- HERE'S AN ILLUSTRATION

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:30.784
THIS IS FROM -- THE NEW YORK

01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:33.120
TIMES -- IN RESEARCHERS HAVE

01:46:33.186 --> 01:46:34.654
PICKED UP ON THIS FIRST FOR

01:46:34.721 --> 01:46:36.923
QUITE SOME TIME -- BUT IF YOU

01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:38.825
LOOK OVER TO CALIFORNIA IF YOU

01:46:38.892 --> 01:46:43.263
pINTO SAN DIEGO YOU CAN SEE HOW A

01:46:43.330 --> 01:46:44.765
LOT OF THE ERROR WAS GOING FROM

01:46:44.831 --> 01:46:46.900
ARIZONA TO CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:49.269
BECAUSE A GUN LAWS TEND TO BE.

01:46:49.336 --> 01:46:53.106
MORE LAX IN PLACES LIKE ARIZONA

01:46:53.173 --> 01:46:54.674
END OF THAT AND SO IT'S A LOT

01:46:54.741 --> 01:46:56.276
EASIER TO GET.

01:46:56.343 --> 01:46:57.043
HAND GUNS [inaudible]

01:46:57.110 --> 01:46:58.912
LEGALLY.

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:01.281
AND THEN TO TRANSPORT THEM INTO

01:47:01.348 --> 01:47:02.516
PLACES.

01:47:02.582 --> 01:47:05.552
LIKE -- SAN DIEGO [inaudible]

01:47:05.619 --> 01:47:08.388
SO -- THE GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATES

01:47:08.455 --> 01:47:10.023
THE TRAIN WE SEE IN SAN DIEGO

01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:11.691
FARMS BEING TRAFFICKED TO

01:47:11.758 --> 01:47:13.693
CALIFORNIA FROM ARIZONA BECAUSE

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:14.928
OF THE WEEK LAWS.

01:47:14.995 --> 01:47:16.930
IN MANY OF THE GUNS ARE LEGALLY

01:47:16.997 --> 01:47:18.632
PURCHASED ACCORDING TO THE

01:47:18.698 --> 01:47:20.100
OFFICERS THAT I SPOKE WITH.

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:22.469
AND IF GOING TO SORT OF RELATE

01:47:22.536 --> 01:47:23.970
THIS TO GANG VIOLENCE OR GANG

01:47:24.037 --> 01:47:25.772
VIOLENCE IS A PROBLEM BUT IT IS

01:47:25.839 --> 01:47:27.207
FURTHER FUELLED.

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:29.442
WHEN GAINING WHEN GANGS ARE ABLE

01:47:29.509 --> 01:47:32.112
TO GAIN ACCESS TO WEAPONS?

01:47:32.179 --> 01:47:33.980
AND THERE'S IT'S NOT A SERIOUS

01:47:34.047 --> 01:47:35.882
IMPEDIMENT SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS --

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:38.218
THE ACCESS TO GUNS AS WELL FOR

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:39.252
GONNA TALK ABOUT GANG VIOLENCE

01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:40.954
AND HOW PEOPLE GET THESE HAND

01:47:41.021 --> 01:47:43.690
GUNS -- I ALSO DID SOME HAVE

01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:44.724
BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH IN

01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:46.059
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ON A RELATED

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:48.061
PROJECT -- AND A IT HERE IN

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:49.629
SACRAMENTO DID GETTING

01:47:49.696 --> 01:47:50.931
ENFORCEMENT TEAM PEOPLE THAT

01:47:50.997 --> 01:47:52.199
I'VE TALKED TO AN INTERVIEW THAT

01:47:52.265 --> 01:47:53.300
TOLD ME THAT.

01:47:53.366 --> 01:47:54.835
MOST OF THE HAND GUNS USED IN

01:47:54.901 --> 01:47:55.902
HOMICIDES IN SHOOTINGS IN

01:47:55.969 --> 01:48:00.307
SACRAMENTO COME FROM NEVADA.

01:48:00.373 --> 01:48:01.708
SO THAT'S ALSO ONE OF THE FLOW

01:48:01.775 --> 01:48:02.576
CHARTS YOU SEE THERE ARE THERE'S

01:48:02.642 --> 01:48:04.644
AN ARROW COMING FROM THE VADA

01:48:04.711 --> 01:48:05.812
BUT FROM THE OFFICERS I TALK TO

01:48:05.879 --> 01:48:06.379
YOU.

01:48:06.446 --> 01:48:08.014
THERE'S A LOT OF HAND GUNS

01:48:08.081 --> 01:48:09.783
COMING FROM THE VET -- INTO

01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:11.184
SACRAMENTO AND FEELING A LOT OF

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:13.620
THE VIOLENCE IN THE PLACES THAT

01:48:13.687 --> 01:48:15.455
I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER -- IN

01:48:15.522 --> 01:48:18.425
SOUTH SACRAMENTO AND IN -- DEL

01:48:18.491 --> 01:48:19.559
PASAL HEIGHTS.

01:48:19.626 --> 01:48:20.760
NOW LET ME JUST SAY THIS NOW

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:21.862
BECAUSE I KNOW POLICIES

01:48:21.928 --> 01:48:24.231
IMPORTANT -- FOR FOR THE

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:25.765
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND IT FOR YOUR

01:48:25.832 --> 01:48:26.766
OFFICE SO WHAT ARE THE

01:48:26.833 --> 01:48:29.536
IMPLICATIONS FOR OF MY FINDINGS

01:48:29.603 --> 01:48:30.904
HERE.

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:33.740
WELL WHAT CAN BE DONE SO THE ATF

01:48:33.807 --> 01:48:35.275
TRACES THE SERIAL NUMBER TO FIND

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:36.610
OUT THE SOURCE OF THE

01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:38.511
MANUFACTURER IN DEALER. TO THE

01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:40.280
WEAPON WAS PURCHASED FROM BUT AS

01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:41.548
MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW OR MAYBE

01:48:41.615 --> 01:48:43.416
SOME OF YOU DON'T KNOW THERE IS

01:48:43.483 --> 01:48:44.784
NO FEDERAL.

01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:47.754
DATABASE THAT KEEPS TRACK OF

01:48:47.821 --> 01:48:50.523
GUNS THAT ARE PURCHASED SO I

01:48:50.590 --> 01:48:52.692
THINK THAT'S AN ONGOING --

01:48:52.759 --> 01:48:54.828
PROBLEM -- PEOPLE THINK IT'S SO

01:48:54.895 --> 01:48:56.196
YOU CAN JUST TYPE THE NUMBER

01:48:56.263 --> 01:48:57.597
INTO A COMPUTER IT'S NOT THE WAY

01:48:57.664 --> 01:48:59.132
IT WORKS ARE LITERALLY.

01:48:59.199 --> 01:49:00.734
YOU HAVE TO USE LIKE A CARD

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.369
INDEX I WAS JUST FROM THE AT THE

01:49:02.435 --> 01:49:03.904
CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY REALLY

01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:05.672
HAVE TO GO TO A CARD INDEX.

01:49:05.739 --> 01:49:07.173
AND MAKE A REQUEST AND IT TAKES

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:10.210
MONTHS SOMETIMES FOR THE A TF --

01:49:10.277 --> 01:49:11.945
TO GET THE SERIAL NUMBER ON

01:49:12.012 --> 01:49:13.647
THESE WEAPONS.

01:49:13.713 --> 01:49:15.515
WHAT ABOUT THE LOCAL LEVEL --

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:17.250
STRAYS DATA FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:49:17.317 --> 01:49:19.452
OFFICIALS IS COLLECTED BUT IT'S

01:49:19.519 --> 01:49:20.854
NOT DONE IN A SYSTEMIC

01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:22.989
SYSTEMATIC ORGANIZED HUESO

01:49:23.056 --> 01:49:23.823
THAT'S ONE THING THAT CAN BE

01:49:23.890 --> 01:49:24.824
DONE.

01:49:24.891 --> 01:49:27.460
IS -- TO HAVE A CALL FOR LOCAL

01:49:27.527 --> 01:49:29.262
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO HAVE

01:49:29.329 --> 01:49:31.798
A DEVELOPED DATABASE TO TRACK

01:49:31.865 --> 01:49:33.133
WEAPONS COMING INTO THE CITY

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:34.834
HOMICIDE DETECTIVES ALREADY DO

01:49:34.901 --> 01:49:35.969
THAT BUT THEY DON'T IT'S NOT

01:49:36.036 --> 01:49:37.103
REALLY FULLY DEVELOPED.

01:49:37.170 --> 01:49:38.571
DATABASE THAT'S MEANT TO BE

01:49:38.638 --> 01:49:39.773
SHARED.

01:49:39.839 --> 01:49:42.008
WITH OTHER POLICYMAKERS AND THEN

01:49:42.075 --> 01:49:43.076
AT THE STATE LEVEL MY

01:49:43.143 --> 01:49:44.110
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE STATE OF

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:46.346
CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A DATABASE.

01:49:46.413 --> 01:49:48.048
I'M NOT SURE HOW FULLY DEVELOPED

01:49:48.114 --> 01:49:49.649
IT IS BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:49:49.716 --> 01:49:50.283
WORTH.

01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:52.085
REVSITING WHAT THE STATE OF

01:49:52.152 --> 01:49:54.921
CALIFORNIA'S DATABASE LOOKS LIKE.

01:49:54.988 --> 01:49:57.157
FOUR SERIAL NUMBERS -- AND HOW

01:49:57.223 --> 01:49:58.992
THE STATE CAN COOPERATE WITH

01:49:59.059 --> 01:50:00.660
CITIES TO TRY TO FIND OUT THE

01:50:00.727 --> 01:50:03.163
ORIGINS OF GUNS USED.

01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:04.931
IN SHOOTING SO THOSE ARE THOSE

01:50:04.998 --> 01:50:06.967
ARE THREE THINGS.

01:50:07.033 --> 01:50:08.368
THE POLICY IN.

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.203
THE SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE I

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:11.271
THINK FURTHER EXPLORED THAT

01:50:11.338 --> 01:50:13.807
MIGHT BE A TAKE AWAY -- FROM THE

01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:14.040
STOCK.

01:50:14.107 --> 01:50:16.209
SO -- FOR THIS PORTION OF THE

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:17.544
TALK WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS

01:50:17.610 --> 01:50:21.247
CLEARLY STRICTER GUN REGULATIONS

01:50:21.314 --> 01:50:22.716
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ARE NEAT

01:50:22.782 --> 01:50:23.750
ARE NEEDED.

01:50:23.817 --> 01:50:24.884
AND THERE'S A TAKE AWAY FROM

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:27.454
THIS AND THAT IS RED STATES AND

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.723
THEIR GUN LAWS ARE PARTIALLY

01:50:29.789 --> 01:50:32.592
RESPONSIBLE FOR GUN VIOLENCE IN

01:50:32.659 --> 01:50:34.361
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

01:50:34.427 --> 01:50:35.662
AND IT'S NOT THE OTHER WAY

01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:36.763
AROUND WE GET A BAD RAP IN

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.231
CALIFORNIA IS BEING A VIOLENT

01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:40.734
PLACE -- YOU KNOW FULL OF KINGS

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:41.634
BUT IT TURNS OUT A LOT OF THE

01:50:41.701 --> 01:50:43.536
VIOLENCE ITS FUEL THAN IN THE

01:50:43.603 --> 01:50:45.505
STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONS FROM

01:50:45.572 --> 01:50:48.942
GUNS IN NEIGHBORING RED STATES

01:50:49.009 --> 01:50:49.542
THAT HAVE.

01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:52.278
WEAK GUN LAWS SO I THINK THAT'S

01:50:52.345 --> 01:50:54.147
DEFINITELY SOMETHING -- THAT

01:50:54.214 --> 01:50:55.315
NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED A PROGRAM

01:50:55.382 --> 01:50:57.317
TALK ABOUT GANGS IN GUN VIOLENCE

01:50:57.384 --> 01:50:58.952
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

01:50:59.019 --> 01:51:00.353
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEREFORE

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:02.455
IS CONTRIBUTING TO GUN VIOLENCE

01:51:02.522 --> 01:51:08.128
IN AREAS OF DISADVANTAGE.

01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:08.728
RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY

01:51:08.795 --> 01:51:09.029
TALK ABOUT.

01:51:09.095 --> 01:51:11.464
WHERE HOW GUNS ARE REQUIRED ON

01:51:11.531 --> 01:51:13.366
THE STREETS THAT ARE USED?

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:15.068
IN HOMICIDES.

01:51:15.135 --> 01:51:16.569
SO THE SECOND LEADING WAY

01:51:16.636 --> 01:51:18.405
FIREARMS ARE REQUIRED IS THROUGH

01:51:18.471 --> 01:51:20.240
THEFT.

01:51:20.306 --> 01:51:21.608
BASED ON INTERVIEWS AND FIELD

01:51:21.674 --> 01:51:22.509
OBSERVATIONS WITH LAW

01:51:22.575 --> 01:51:23.977
ENFORCEMENT STAFF THAT THIS IS

01:51:24.044 --> 01:51:26.112
THE SECOND MOST COMMON WAY IN

01:51:26.179 --> 01:51:27.747
THIS USUALLY HAPPENS.

01:51:27.814 --> 01:51:29.315
IN HOME ROBBERIES OF TALK TO

01:51:29.382 --> 01:51:30.850
POLICE OFFICERS INTERVIEWED THEM

01:51:30.917 --> 01:51:32.252
IN WHAT PEOPLE DO IS I'LL TRY TO

01:51:32.318 --> 01:51:34.054
GAIN INTEL ON PEOPLE IN A VERY

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.889
DELIBERATE WAY. ONE EXAMPLE I

01:51:35.955 --> 01:51:38.024
WAS GIVEN -- IS SOMETIMES PEOPLE

01:51:38.091 --> 01:51:39.826
WILL GO TO SHOOTING RANGE.

01:51:39.893 --> 01:51:40.527
THEY'LL SEE WHO HAS THE

01:51:40.593 --> 01:51:41.828
EXPENSIVE GUN LOOKS LIKE THEY

01:51:41.895 --> 01:51:43.563
HAVE MONEY AND PEOPLE FOLLOW

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:45.298
THESE INDIVIDUALS HOME THE CASE

01:51:45.365 --> 01:51:46.232
THEIR HOME.

01:51:46.299 --> 01:51:47.700
AND WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT THEY

01:51:47.767 --> 01:51:49.702
MIGHT ROB THAT HOUSE FOR THAT

01:51:49.769 --> 01:51:51.171
GUN OR IT COULD BE SOMEBODY

01:51:51.237 --> 01:51:52.505
DOING SOME WORK IN YOUR HOME IF

01:51:52.572 --> 01:51:54.274
THEY HEAR THERE'S A GUN THERE.

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:56.009
THEY'LL ROB THAT HOUSE -- THE

01:51:56.076 --> 01:51:57.677
SECOND MOST COMMON WAYS WHAT'S

01:51:57.744 --> 01:51:59.846
KNOWN AS A SMASH AND GRAB -- SO

01:51:59.913 --> 01:52:01.448
IN SACRAMENTO THERE WAS A RASH

01:52:01.514 --> 01:52:03.283
OF ROBBERIES AT GUN STORES WERE

01:52:03.349 --> 01:52:05.251
PEOPLE WOULD BACK THEIR CARS UP

01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:06.853
INTO A GUN STORE.

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.721
AND THEN JUST A PILE OF PEOPLE

01:52:08.788 --> 01:52:09.322
WOULD JUMP OUT AND THEY WOULD

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:11.324
TRY TO JUST PACK AS MANY GUNS AS

01:52:11.391 --> 01:52:12.492
A KIDS OF THEFT.

01:52:12.559 --> 01:52:14.794
IS A VERY COMMON WAY THAT GUNS

01:52:14.861 --> 01:52:17.697
GET IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO

01:52:17.764 --> 01:52:19.232
SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM -- THEN THE

01:52:19.299 --> 01:52:21.935
THIRD MOST COMMON WAY IN THIS IS.

01:52:22.001 --> 01:52:23.970
GONNA BE THE CHALLENGE FOR THE

01:52:24.037 --> 01:52:26.339
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:27.607
COUNTRY NOW IT WHAT'S KNOWN AS

01:52:27.674 --> 01:52:29.609
THE GHOST GUNS.

01:52:29.676 --> 01:52:32.245
GHOST GUNS -- ARE INCREASINGLY

01:52:32.312 --> 01:52:34.247
USED IN HOMICIDES IN IN GAME

01:52:34.314 --> 01:52:37.016
VIOLENCE AS WELL -- IN THE FIRST

01:52:37.083 --> 01:52:38.518
THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT WAYS OF

01:52:38.585 --> 01:52:39.619
THREE VERSIONS OF GOES GUNS I'LL

01:52:39.686 --> 01:52:40.787
SHARE WITH YOU THAT I'VE

01:52:40.854 --> 01:52:41.988
DISCOVERED IN MY RESEARCH THE

01:52:42.055 --> 01:52:43.223
FIRST.

01:52:43.289 --> 01:52:44.757
IS THE THREE D. PRINTERS.

01:52:44.824 --> 01:52:46.326
SO -- THREE D. PRINTERS ARE NOW

01:52:46.392 --> 01:52:47.894
BECOMING MORE COMMON YOU CAN

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:49.562
PRETTY MUCH PRINT ANYTHING WITH

01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:50.897
A THREE D. PRINTER.

01:52:50.964 --> 01:52:53.633
AND GUNS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING

01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:55.468
USED IN THE BLACK MARKET AND AND

01:52:55.535 --> 01:52:58.071
THERE'S NO WAY OF TRACING SERIAL

01:52:58.138 --> 01:53:00.240
NUMBERS BACK BECAUSE THERE ISN'T

01:53:00.306 --> 01:53:01.674
ONE RIGHT SO THAT'S THAT'S THIS

01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:03.343
IS GONNA BE A CHALLENGE I THINK

01:53:03.409 --> 01:53:04.410
FOR POLICY MAKERS.

01:53:04.477 --> 01:53:06.546
THE SECOND TYPE OF GOES GUN IS

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:09.015
WHERE MAYBE A PERSON HOUSE THE

01:53:09.082 --> 01:53:10.750
BOTTOM PART OF A GUN.

01:53:10.817 --> 01:53:11.951
AND THEY'RE ABLE TO PURCHASE THE

01:53:12.018 --> 01:53:14.087
OTHER PART ONLINE SO YOU CAN BUY

01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:15.855
GUNS IN PIECES -- THIS IS A

01:53:15.922 --> 01:53:17.290
PROBLEM FOR THE GANG IT WAS

01:53:17.357 --> 01:53:19.225
ACTUALLY THE TYPE OF GUN THE

01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:21.161
KILLED TERRIBLE SOLD IN I THINK

01:53:21.227 --> 01:53:22.295
IT WAS AN A. R. HE WAS AN

01:53:22.362 --> 01:53:23.596
ASSAULT RIFLE THAT HAD DIFFERENT

01:53:23.663 --> 01:53:24.631
PARTS.

01:53:24.697 --> 01:53:26.199
THAT WERE PURCHASED ONLINE IS A

01:53:26.266 --> 01:53:27.333
HOMEMADE GUN.

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:28.835
AND THEN THE THIRD TYPE OF GOES

01:53:28.902 --> 01:53:31.070
GUN -- ARE THESE ARE GUNS THAT

01:53:31.137 --> 01:53:33.239
ARE STOLEN IN BULK FROM

01:53:33.306 --> 01:53:35.375
FACTORIES THEY GET IN BEFORE --

01:53:35.441 --> 01:53:36.209
SERIAL NUMBERS ARE PRINTED ON

01:53:36.276 --> 01:53:38.578
THEM -- AND THERE'S NO WAY TO

01:53:38.645 --> 01:53:39.979
TRACE THEM BACK SO ALL THESE ARE

01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:41.447
VERSIONS OF GOES GUNS THEY'RE

01:53:41.514 --> 01:53:43.082
VERY PROBLEMATIC THEY CAN'T BE

01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:44.150
TRACED BACK AND THEY ARE

01:53:44.217 --> 01:53:49.155
BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMMON --

01:53:49.222 --> 01:53:50.557
AMONGST -- GANGS.

01:53:50.623 --> 01:53:51.457
OKAY LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:53:51.524 --> 01:53:53.459
ABOUT THE MOTIVATIONS NOW SO I

01:53:53.526 --> 01:53:55.094
TALKED ABOUT THE ACCESS ONE TALK

01:53:55.161 --> 01:53:57.597
ABOUT WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON

01:53:57.664 --> 01:53:58.398
TYPES.

01:53:58.464 --> 01:54:01.935
OF GUN RELATED HOMICIDES AND

01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:03.736
AGAIN GOING BACK TO SAN DIEGO

01:54:03.803 --> 01:54:04.604
AGAIN.

01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:06.839
AS A WINDOW INTO THE INTO THE

01:54:06.906 --> 01:54:08.308
REST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:54:08.374 --> 01:54:10.076
AND INTO THE COUNTRY.

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:14.380
AND AS TALK ABOUT CRIME -- SO

01:54:14.447 --> 01:54:16.482
ABOUT 10% AND THIS IS JUST BE

01:54:16.549 --> 01:54:18.651
JUST PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM.

01:54:18.718 --> 01:54:21.854
THE CORONER'S OFFICE FILES I GOT

01:54:21.921 --> 01:54:23.223
FROM OTHER QUARTERS OFFICE IN

01:54:23.289 --> 01:54:24.424
THE DA'S OFFICE.

01:54:24.490 --> 01:54:26.526
ABOUT 10% OF GUNS USED IN

01:54:26.593 --> 01:54:28.361
HOMICIDES WERE A RESULT OF A

01:54:28.428 --> 01:54:30.496
ROBBERY.

01:54:30.563 --> 01:54:32.098
AND 3%.

01:54:32.165 --> 01:54:33.866
WERE.

01:54:33.933 --> 01:54:36.469
DRUG MOTIVATED AND LOW ALSO GIVE

01:54:36.536 --> 01:54:40.840
YOU A VERY COMMON TYPE OF DRUG

01:54:40.907 --> 01:54:42.875
RELATED -- ROBBERY THANK YOU SEE

01:54:42.942 --> 01:54:44.210
HERE IN SACRAMENTO SO

01:54:44.277 --> 01:54:46.346
INCREASINGLY IN SACRAMENTO THEY

01:54:46.412 --> 01:54:47.680
HAVE WHAT'S KNOWN AS WE TRIPS --

01:54:47.747 --> 01:54:49.282
EVEN THOUGH MARIJUANA IS LEGAL

01:54:49.349 --> 01:54:50.750
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S

01:54:50.817 --> 01:54:51.951
A LOT CHEAPER TO BUY IT ON THE

01:54:52.018 --> 01:54:54.220
BLACK MARKET BECAUSE OF THE TAX

01:54:54.287 --> 01:54:54.854
BECAUSE YOU GET IT BECAUSE IT

01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:55.922
GETS TAX.

01:54:55.989 --> 01:54:58.057
SO THERE'S A HUGE UNDERGROUND OF

01:54:58.124 --> 01:54:59.859
MARIJUANA INFORMAL MARKET IN

01:54:59.926 --> 01:55:01.628
SACRAMENTO AND LOTS OF PEOPLE

01:55:01.694 --> 01:55:03.129
WILL GET ROB WILL SET UP OF A

01:55:03.196 --> 01:55:04.831
FAKE DEAL.

01:55:04.897 --> 01:55:06.032
PEOPLE WILL WILL GET ROB THEN

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:07.333
WHEN PEOPLE DON'T COOPERATE TO

01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:08.334
GET KILLED SO CORPS IN THE SACK

01:55:08.401 --> 01:55:11.304
PD THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF

01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:13.139
GUN RELATED HOMICIDE THAT WE SEE

01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:14.307
IN PLACES LIKE.

01:55:14.374 --> 01:55:17.477
DEL PASO HEIGHTS OR IN CELL

01:55:17.543 --> 01:55:20.947
SACRAMENTO -- OKAY MOVING ALONG --

01:55:21.014 --> 01:55:22.715
GANG RELATED THIS SECTION IS ON

01:55:22.782 --> 01:55:24.717
GAMING'S.

01:55:24.784 --> 01:55:27.754
AND SO -- A SIGNIFICANT PERCENT.

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:31.257
OF GUN RELATED HOMICIDES -- OR

01:55:31.324 --> 01:55:34.494
GANG RELATED 39% OF HOMICIDES

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.229
INVOLVING HOMICIDE OR FARMS WERE

01:55:36.296 --> 01:55:37.297
GANG RELATED.

01:55:37.363 --> 01:55:38.598
AT WERE IN THIS THE WAY THAT

01:55:38.665 --> 01:55:39.732
THEY DETERMINE WHETHER WAS

01:55:39.799 --> 01:55:41.968
GETTING THAT WAS THE SHOOTER AND

01:55:42.035 --> 01:55:43.369
OR VICTIM IS DOCUMENTED

01:55:43.436 --> 01:55:44.937
DOCUMENTED.

01:55:45.004 --> 01:55:47.073
AS A GANG MEMBER GANG RIVALRIES

01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:49.742
CONSTITUTED ABOUT 13% IN AGAIN

01:55:49.809 --> 01:55:52.779
WHY WORRY WAS 8% LET ME JUST

01:55:52.845 --> 01:55:54.714
PAUSE HERE FOR A SECOND -- WHEN

01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:57.116
WE USE THE GANG THE THE TERM

01:55:57.183 --> 01:55:58.818
GAINING -- IT'S I THINK IT'S

01:55:58.885 --> 01:56:00.486
VERY PROBLEMATIC WE HAVE TO

01:56:00.553 --> 01:56:02.722
APPROACH THIS CONCEPT WITH A

01:56:02.789 --> 01:56:04.957
LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION.

01:56:05.024 --> 01:56:07.093
WHY DO WE NEED TO PROCEED IN A

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.428
CAUTIOUS WAY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT?

01:56:08.494 --> 01:56:10.096
GANGS.

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:11.698
WELL FIRST OF ALL GETTING IS A

01:56:11.764 --> 01:56:14.267
FLUID CONCEPT THAT USE USE FOR

01:56:14.334 --> 01:56:15.835
PROTECTION -- IN ITS

01:56:15.902 --> 01:56:18.271
INCREASINGLY LESS IMPORTANT

01:56:18.338 --> 01:56:19.439
SENSE NEIGHBORHOOD IDENTITY

01:56:19.505 --> 01:56:20.640
OFTEN TRUMP'S GETTING A JENNY SO

01:56:20.707 --> 01:56:22.608
USEFUL USES I'M GONNA GAME BUT

01:56:22.675 --> 01:56:23.943
THEY'RE NOT REALLY JUST KIND OF

01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:24.477
USE IT TO KIND OF PROTECT

01:56:24.544 --> 01:56:25.578
THEMSELVES.

01:56:25.645 --> 01:56:27.213
SO THAT'S A PROBLEM.

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:28.781
THE BIGGER PROBLEM THOUGH IS THE

01:56:28.848 --> 01:56:30.683
TENDENCY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:33.953
SEE COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE GANG

01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:36.289
LANDS AND I THINK WE NEED TO IT

01:56:36.356 --> 01:56:37.390
REQUIRES.

01:56:37.457 --> 01:56:40.159
GREATER - INVESTIGATION TO TRY

01:56:40.226 --> 01:56:42.295
TO FIND OUT IF A SHOOTING WAR

01:56:42.362 --> 01:56:46.733
CRIME IS IN FACT -- GANG RELATED --

01:56:46.799 --> 01:56:47.834
AND SO THE CHALLENGE FOR LAW

01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:49.335
ENFORCEMENT AND POLICY MAKERS IS

01:56:49.402 --> 01:56:51.838
TRY TO UNPACK THE UNIQUENESS OF

01:56:51.904 --> 01:56:53.473
GUN RELATED HOMICIDE AND WE

01:56:53.539 --> 01:56:55.241
SHOULDN'T BE QUICK JUST TO SAY.

01:56:55.308 --> 01:56:59.612
THAT IT'S GANG RELATED -- AND OF

01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:01.214
COURSE WE KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:02.515
WE NEED TO ADDRESS GAINES THAT

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:05.118
AS A AS A PROBLEM -- AS WELL.

01:57:05.184 --> 01:57:08.955
OKAY SO THAT'S A GANG RELATED.

01:57:09.021 --> 01:57:10.923
HOMICIDES.

01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:12.992
AND THEN THE LAST MOTIVATION

01:57:13.059 --> 01:57:15.294
THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS --

01:57:15.361 --> 01:57:17.930
WHAT I'M CALLING INTERPERSONAL --

01:57:17.997 --> 01:57:20.933
GUN RELATED HOMICIDES. 40% OF A

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.936
FIREMAN HOMES INVOLVED

01:57:24.003 --> 01:57:27.507
INTERPERSONAL CONFLICT. 21%.

01:57:27.573 --> 01:57:30.843
OF THAT 40% WERE DOMESTIC -- AND

01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:33.045
SO.

01:57:33.112 --> 01:57:34.514
IF YOU'RE FOR POLICE OFFICER I'M

01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:35.715
SURE I'M SURE YOU'VESEEN WHAT

01:57:35.782 --> 01:57:37.450
HAPPENS WHEN POLICE OFFICERS GO

01:57:37.517 --> 01:57:39.185
ON A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALL.

01:57:39.252 --> 01:57:40.319
THESE ARE SITUATIONS IT CAN

01:57:40.386 --> 01:57:43.856
ESCALATE VERY QUICKLY -- THIS IS

01:57:43.923 --> 01:57:46.125
ACTUALLY THE THE INCIDENT THAT --

01:57:46.192 --> 01:57:47.126
TERRACE ALL SOLVING THE MENTION

01:57:47.193 --> 01:57:48.528
A NAME AGAIN WAS EXPOSED TO WIND

01:57:48.594 --> 01:57:52.064
WHEN SHE WAS SHOT -- SO --

01:57:52.131 --> 01:57:56.636
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A OFTEN OF

01:57:56.702 --> 01:57:58.337
COMMON WAY IN WHICH GUN BY ITS

01:57:58.404 --> 01:58:00.173
CAN ESCALATE VERY QUICKLY IN IN

01:58:00.239 --> 01:58:01.574
IT COMES UP IN A LOT OF THE DATA.

01:58:01.641 --> 01:58:03.042
THAT I'VE SEEN AND THEN FINALLY

01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:04.811
RELATED TO INTERPERSONAL

01:58:04.877 --> 01:58:07.013
CONFLICT WE HAVE INCIDENTS --

01:58:07.079 --> 01:58:08.481
THAT ARE NOT INTERPERSONAL OR

01:58:08.548 --> 01:58:10.950
NOT DOMESTIC -- AND THEY'RE JUST

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:12.585
A RESULT OF PERSONAL BEEF SO

01:58:12.652 --> 01:58:16.422
THOSE ARE THE THREE MOST COMMON --

01:58:16.489 --> 01:58:19.625
MOTIVATIONS. FOR GUN VIOLENCE

01:58:19.692 --> 01:58:21.694

GO TO THE OTHER PANELISTS OKAY --

01:58:28.901 --> 01:58:29.902
IT'S DIFFICULT TO EXAMINE GUNS

01:58:29.969 --> 01:58:31.237
AND BUY IT SEPARATELY FROM GUN

01:58:31.304 --> 01:58:33.072
VIOLENCE -- AGAIN JUST TO KIND

01:58:33.139 --> 01:58:34.140

HELPING ME GET THROUGH THE

01:59:58.524 --> 01:59:59.825
CONFUSION THAT THAT ENVIRONMENT

01:59:59.892 --> 02:00:01.160
BRINGS.

02:00:01.227 --> 02:00:02.528
SO I GREW UP ANGRY.

02:00:02.595 --> 02:00:04.297
BITTER AND FELL INTO THE SAME

02:00:04.363 --> 02:00:06.165

FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE STEP IN

02:00:06.832 --> 02:00:07.733

I GREW UP DEPRESSED.

02:00:09.035 --> 02:00:10.870
ISOLATED AND FULL OF RAGING

02:00:10.937 --> 02:00:11.771
CONTENT.

02:00:11.837 --> 02:00:13.005
AND BECAUSE OF MY ADOLESCENT

02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:14.206
MIND EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE

02:00:14.273 --> 02:00:15.608
SHOWED ME THAT NO ONE CARED

02:00:15.675 --> 02:00:18.010
ABOUT ME AND MY OBLIGATION WAS

02:00:18.077 --> 02:00:19.078
TO FEND FOR MYSELF.

02:00:19.145 --> 02:00:20.479
IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING OR AT

02:00:20.546 --> 02:00:22.181
LEAST BELIEVE IN THIS I BECAME

02:00:22.248 --> 02:00:23.316
VERY SELFISH.

02:00:23.382 --> 02:00:24.517
I BELIEVE NO ONE CARED ABOUT ME

02:00:24.584 --> 02:00:25.785
SO WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT

02:00:25.851 --> 02:00:27.186
ANYONE ELSE.

02:00:27.253 --> 02:00:28.487
AND I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR

02:00:28.554 --> 02:00:30.823
THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE

02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:32.024
FOR A YOUNG PERSON TO BE.

02:00:32.091 --> 02:00:34.060
IN BREACH LONELINESS NO SENSE OF

02:00:34.126 --> 02:00:35.895
BELONGING AND SECURITIES AND LOW

02:00:35.962 --> 02:00:36.896
SELF ESTEEM.

02:00:36.963 --> 02:00:39.031
IT LITERALL CREATE SUICIDAL

02:00:39.098 --> 02:00:39.966
THOUGHTS AND TENDENCIES.

02:00:40.032 --> 02:00:41.801
AND THEY'RE VERY CLEAR BY THE

02:00:41.867 --> 02:00:42.868
WAY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LIVING

02:00:42.935 --> 02:00:44.370
THEIR LIFE LIKE THEY ARE NOT

02:00:44.437 --> 02:00:45.838
PLANNING FOR FUTURE.

02:00:45.905 --> 02:00:47.740
IN A PUT IT PLAINLY -- LITTLE

02:00:47.807 --> 02:00:48.941
WING SAYS IT THE BEST.

02:00:49.008 --> 02:00:51.077
WAS THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF

02:00:51.143 --> 02:00:53.412
SOMEONE WHO HAS NO EXPECTATIONS.

02:00:53.479 --> 02:00:55.081
THIS IS THE STATE OF MOST URBAN

02:00:55.147 --> 02:00:56.449
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE.

02:00:56.515 --> 02:00:57.249
AND AS I'M SURE YOU ARE ALL

02:00:57.316 --> 02:00:58.751

THE INCEPTION OF THIS COUNTRY.

02:01:03.122 --> 02:01:04.390

AND HOPEFULLY YOU WILL HAVE

02:01:16.802 --> 02:01:17.903
OTHER SENATE COMMITTEES.

02:01:17.970 --> 02:01:19.505
HEARINGS ON THOSE THINGS --

02:01:19.572 --> 02:01:21.207
BECAUSE OF WHAT IT IS DONE IS

02:01:21.273 --> 02:01:23.542
DAMAGE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

02:01:23.609 --> 02:01:25.077
AND TO BE CLEAR ALL OF THESE AND

MUCH MORE PLAYED A VERY

02:01:25.911 --> 02:01:27.246
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE STATE OF

02:01:27.313 --> 02:01:28.581
URBAN COMMUNITIES.

02:01:28.648 --> 02:01:30.116
AND SADLY MOST OF THE VICTIMS OF

02:01:30.182 --> 02:01:31.817
THESE GOVERNMENT POLICIES AREN'T

02:01:31.884 --> 02:01:33.319
EVEN AWARE OF THEIR EXISTENCE.

02:01:33.386 --> 02:01:35.688
ALL THEY'RE AWARE OF HIS THIS IS

02:03:28.434 --> 02:03:30.402
THREE SHOOTING HOMICIDES IN THAT

02:03:30.469 --> 02:03:32.738
CITY -- SO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

02:03:32.805 --> 02:03:34.039
ALL OF OUR ENERGY WAS DEPLOYED

02:03:34.106 --> 02:03:35.541
TO THAT AREA AND IS SEEN THREE

02:03:35.608 --> 02:03:36.976
SHOOTING DEATHS IN TWO THOUSAND

02:03:37.042 --> 02:03:39.779
AND THE CITY LOOK AT IT IS

02:03:39.845 --> 02:03:41.647
SUCCESS SPREAD THE FOR OUTREACH

02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:43.149
WORKERS TO THE WHOLE CD AND LOW

02:03:43.215 --> 02:03:44.850
BEHOLD.

02:03:44.917 --> 02:03:45.384
WE ENDED UP RIGHT WHERE WE

02:03:45.451 --> 02:03:46.519
STARTED.%

02:03:46.585 --> 02:03:48.387
SO IN THIS LEADERSHIP REALIZED

02:03:48.454 --> 02:03:48.954
THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A

02:03:49.021 --> 02:03:50.489
LOOK.

02:03:50.556 --> 02:03:51.791
AND DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE A

02:03:51.857 --> 02:03:53.092
LITTLE DIFFERENTLY TO MAXIMIZE

02:03:53.159 --> 02:03:54.460
OUR IMPACT WITH LIMITED

02:03:54.527 --> 02:03:56.962
RESOURCES -- DURING THAT TIME WE

02:03:57.029 --> 02:03:58.497
ALSO REALIZE THAT ALTHOUGH THERE

02:03:58.564 --> 02:04:00.299
WERE MANY PEOPLE IMPACTED IN

02:04:00.366 --> 02:04:01.000
THESE COMMUNITIES BY GUN

02:04:01.066 --> 02:04:02.401
VIOLENCE IS A VERY SMALL

02:04:02.468 --> 02:04:04.236
PERCENTAGE OF THEM WHO ARE

02:04:04.303 --> 02:04:06.305
ACTUALLY CREATING THE STATISTICS --

02:04:06.372 --> 02:04:07.640
IN THE COMMUNITY.

02:04:07.706 --> 02:04:08.908
SO IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND

02:04:08.974 --> 02:04:09.842
TEN WE TOOK A DIFFERENT APPROACH

02:04:09.909 --> 02:04:12.411
AND WE CREATED WHAT WE CALL THE

02:04:12.478 --> 02:04:14.513
OPERATION PEACEMAKER FELLOWSHIP.

02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:16.215
THE FELLOWSHIP IS A NON MANDATED

02:04:16.282 --> 02:04:17.716
INTENSIVE MENTORING INTERVENTION

MOST IMPACTED BY GUN VIOLENCE IN

02:04:22.922 --> 02:04:24.123
THE CITY OF RICHMOND.

02:04:24.190 --> 02:04:25.124
THE LAST MINIMUM OF EIGHTEEN

02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:26.625
MONTHS AND CONSIST OF SEVENTY

02:04:32.464 --> 02:04:33.232
LIVES.

02:04:33.299 --> 02:04:34.400
WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO TRUST

02:04:34.466 --> 02:04:35.868
US ENOUGH TO PARTNER WITH US ON

02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:37.670
THIS JOURNEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL

02:04:37.736 --> 02:04:38.971
WITH DAILY CONTACTS.

02:04:39.038 --> 02:04:40.172
WE WILL CONTINUOUSLY PROVIDE

02:04:40.239 --> 02:04:42.041
HEALTH INFORMATION AND THEY

02:04:42.107 --> 02:04:44.009
CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN HAVE

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:45.411
A PRODUCTIVE FUTURE.

02:04:45.477 --> 02:04:46.812
THEY CAN PLAN FOR THEIR FUTURE

02:04:46.879 --> 02:04:48.514
AND GET CASTING HELP FEEDBACK

02:04:48.581 --> 02:04:49.882

02:05:05.564 --> 02:05:06.966
INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSFERS OF

02:05:07.032 --> 02:05:09.468
INFORMATION TO OUR ELDERS CIRCLE.

02:05:09.535 --> 02:05:10.703
IN IN BEING REWARDED FOR YOUR

02:05:10.769 --> 02:05:12.004
HARD WORK AND DEDICATION TO YOUR

02:05:12.071 --> 02:05:13.839
PERSONAL PROCESS CAN CREATE HOLE

02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:16.642
IN WHAT SOME WOULD CONSIDER A

02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:18.677
HOPELESS SITUATION.

02:05:18.744 --> 02:05:20.379
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE PUT.

02:05:20.446 --> 02:05:21.780
THE ONUS HAS LIMITED RESOURCES

02:05:21.847 --> 02:05:22.748
SO IN ORDER TO BE THE MOST

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:25.084
EFFECTIVE OUR FELLOWS MUST BE

02:05:25.150 --> 02:05:25.584
SELECTED WITH THE UTMOST

02:05:25.651 --> 02:05:26.619
PRECISION.

02:05:26.685 --> 02:05:28.053
OF THE NCAA'S PUBLIC SAFETY

02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:29.622
ORGANIZATION CBO'S AND COMMUNITY

02:05:29.688 --> 02:05:30.956
MEMBERS ARE KEY TO PROVIDING

02:05:31.023 --> 02:05:32.691
INFORMATION TO HELP WITH THIS

02:05:32.758 --> 02:05:34.260
SELECTION PROCESS.

02:05:34.326 --> 02:05:35.828
THE ONUS HAS A LASER FOCUS WHEN

02:05:35.895 --> 02:05:37.129
DECIDING WHOM TO ENGAGE FOR THE

02:05:37.196 --> 02:05:38.564
FELLOWSHIP AND ONE DONE RIGHT

02:05:38.631 --> 02:05:40.032
CITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND

02:05:40.099 --> 02:05:42.101
COUNTRY CAN CREATE THE RESULTS

02:05:42.167 --> 02:05:43.435
THAT WE HAVE SEEN AND REYES.

02:05:43.502 --> 02:05:44.637
WE STARTED THIS PROCESS IN TWO

02:05:44.703 --> 02:05:46.505
THOUSAND TEEN.

02:05:46.572 --> 02:05:48.374
AND WE HAVE COMPLETED FIVE COAL

02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:51.176
WORDS SINCE THE OF THOSE FIVE

02:05:51.243 --> 02:05:52.544
COURSE WE'VE HAD A HUNDRED AND

02:05:52.611 --> 02:05:55.581
SIX FELLOWS. 96% OF THOSE

02:05:55.648 --> 02:05:57.950
FELLOWS ARE STILL ALIVE. 80% OF

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:58.951
THOSE FELLOWS HAD NOT BEEN

02:05:59.018 --> 02:06:00.252
INJURED BY FIREARMS IS BECOMING

02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:01.420
A FELLOW.

02:06:01.487 --> 02:06:03.022
AND 70% OF THOSE FELLOWS HAVE

02:06:03.088 --> 02:06:05.457
NOT BEEN SUSPECTED OF A FIREARM

02:06:05.524 --> 02:06:06.058
RELATED CRIME SINCE BECOMING A

02:06:06.125 --> 02:06:07.126
FELLOW.

02:06:07.192 --> 02:06:08.427
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROCESS HAS

02:06:08.494 --> 02:06:10.162
ALLOWED YOUNG MAN IN THE CITY OF

02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:11.664
RICHMOND TO BEGIN QUESTIONING.

02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:13.132
HOW THE OF NORMALLY DEALT WITH

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:14.566
THEIR CONFLICT AND GIVEN THEM

02:06:14.633 --> 02:06:16.335
COURAGE TO CHALLENGE THAT AND

02:06:16.402 --> 02:06:17.670
DEAL WITH IT IN A MORE HEALTHY

02:06:17.736 --> 02:06:18.871
AND PRODUCTIVE WAY?

02:06:18.938 --> 02:06:20.072
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THESE YOUNG

02:06:20.139 --> 02:06:21.473
MAN'S BETTER DECISION MAKING HAS

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:23.242
BEEN A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE

02:06:23.309 --> 02:06:25.277
MASS OF DECLINING SHOOTINGS IN

02:06:25.344 --> 02:06:28.447
THE CITY OF RICHMOND.

02:06:28.514 --> 02:06:30.683
IN SKEWS ME LAST YEAR -- TWO

02:06:30.749 --> 02:06:31.417
THOUSAND EIGHT WE RECORDED THE

02:06:31.483 --> 02:06:32.384
LOWEST AMOUNT OF SHOOTINGS

02:06:32.451 --> 02:06:33.485
LEADING TO INJURY OR DEATH IN

02:06:33.552 --> 02:06:34.553
OVER FORTY YEARS.

02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:37.289
RECORDING A 73% REDUCTION

02:06:37.356 --> 02:06:37.856
COMPARED TO THE YEAR OFFICE

02:06:37.923 --> 02:06:39.491
OPENED.

02:06:39.558 --> 02:06:40.059
CAN I WANT TO PUT THAT INTO

02:06:40.125 --> 02:06:41.193
PERSPECTIVE.

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:42.962
THAT'S TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN

02:06:43.028 --> 02:06:44.697
PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T GET SHOT IN

02:06:44.763 --> 02:06:48.000
OUR COMMUNITY LAST YEAR COMPARED.

02:06:48.067 --> 02:06:48.634
TO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THIS IS A

02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:49.301
PROCESS THAT CAN HELP

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:51.203
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE

02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.837
HELP REDUCE THEIR GUN VIOLENCE

02:06:51.904 --> 02:06:52.671
ISSUES.

02:06:52.738 --> 02:06:54.506
SACRAMENTO IS WELL STOCKED AND

02:06:54.573 --> 02:06:55.474
HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED THIS

02:06:55.541 --> 02:06:57.443
PROCESS IN OUR THEIR PATH TO THE

02:06:57.509 --> 02:06:59.945
SUCCESS -- THE ONLY PROBLEM IS

02:07:00.012 --> 02:07:02.381
TO CREATE THE POLITICAL WILL. TO

02:07:02.448 --> 02:07:03.816
TREAT THESE YOUNG MAN HIS ASSETS

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:05.217
AND VIABLE PARTNERS IN THIS

02:07:05.284 --> 02:07:07.186
ENDEAVOR INSTEAD OF THE ANIMALS

02:07:07.252 --> 02:07:09.154
THAT HAVE CREATED THE RISK.

02:07:09.221 --> 02:07:10.889
THAT ALL OF US ARE DEALING WITH.

02:07:10.956 --> 02:07:13.258
AND I SAY THIS [inaudible]

02:07:13.325 --> 02:07:15.327
EXCUSE ME.

02:07:15.394 --> 02:07:16.662
ANDI SAY THIS BECAUSE THERE'S

02:07:16.729 --> 02:07:17.763
MANY THERE'S BEEN MANY SPEAKERS

02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:19.164
THAT HAVE THAT HAVE COME UP AND

02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:21.633
SO I ALWAYS -- BRING THIS TO

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:23.235
LIGHT.

02:07:23.302 --> 02:07:24.336
LAST YEAR THERE WAS A YOUNG

02:07:24.403 --> 02:07:25.738
WOMAN WHO WAS KILLED OVER

02:07:25.804 --> 02:07:27.439
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUE SHE HAD

02:07:27.506 --> 02:07:29.008
AN ABUSER IT WAS STALKING HER.

02:07:29.074 --> 02:07:31.477
AND HE CAUGHT HER ON THE WAY TO

02:07:31.543 --> 02:07:32.077
DROP HER TWO CHILDREN OFFICE

02:07:32.144 --> 02:07:34.813
SCHOOL -- KILLING HER IN FRONT

02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:37.016
OF THOSE TWO CHILDREN.

02:07:37.082 --> 02:07:37.549
IN THE FIRST THING THAT I

02:07:37.616 --> 02:07:38.384
THOUGHT ABOUT.

02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:40.285
WAS IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T GET A

02:07:40.352 --> 02:07:42.187
HOLD OF THOSE TWO CHILDREN.

02:07:42.254 --> 02:07:43.555
RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY'S LOOKING AT

02:07:43.622 --> 02:07:45.457
THEM AS VICTIMS AND GIVE PT IN

02:07:45.524 --> 02:07:46.859
SORROW FOR THEM.

02:07:46.925 --> 02:07:48.127
BUT IN FIFTEEN YEARS IF IT

02:07:48.193 --> 02:07:49.461
HASN'T BEEN ADDRESSED IN THEIR

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:50.996
RESPONDING IN THIS WAY THEN

02:07:51.063 --> 02:07:51.964
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ANIMALS

02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:54.166
CRIMINALS TO DESERVE PUNISHMENT

02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:57.069
AND INCARCERATIONS.

02:07:57.136 --> 02:07:57.636
SO THAT IS A FAILURE ON THE

02:07:57.703 --> 02:07:58.504
COMMUNITY.

02:07:58.570 --> 02:08:00.239
RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEN THESE THESE

02:08:00.305 --> 02:08:03.542
DETAINMENT CAMPS AND A. O. C.

02:08:03.609 --> 02:08:04.777
BECAUSE IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS.

02:08:04.843 --> 02:08:05.711
WITH THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN BEING

02:08:05.778 --> 02:08:09.581
MISTREATED -- DONALD TRUMP HIS

02:08:09.648 --> 02:08:11.016
HIS ARGUED THAT THESE ARE IN

02:08:11.083 --> 02:08:13.552
MISTER TEEN DRUG DEALERS RAPISTS

02:08:13.619 --> 02:08:15.020
KILLERS THEY'RE COMING INTO THIS

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:16.955
COUNTRY AND HE HAS TO PROTECT US

02:08:17.022 --> 02:08:18.857
FROM THEM.

02:08:18.924 --> 02:08:20.125
IF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DEALT

02:08:20.192 --> 02:08:21.760
WITH CORRECTLY THEY WILL TURN

02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:23.362
INTO EXACTLY WHAT HE'S ACCUSING

02:08:23.429 --> 02:08:25.464
THEM OF IN AND WHAT HE'S GOING

02:08:25.531 --> 02:08:26.832
TO BE SAYING TO SEE I TOLD YOU

02:08:26.899 --> 02:08:27.466
SO.

02:08:27.533 --> 02:08:29.068
BUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IS THEY

02:08:29.134 --> 02:08:31.403
ARE CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR

02:08:31.470 --> 02:08:33.105
THESE THINGS TO TAKE PLACE.

02:08:33.172 --> 02:08:37.709
<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;G AND IT'S IT'S A TRAGEDY&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:38.277
BUT IT'S ALSO A SHAME ON US

02:08:38.343 --> 02:08:40.679
MOMENT -- OUR OUR APPROACH IS

02:08:40.746 --> 02:08:41.980
WHAT IS CONSIDERED A CRIME

02:08:42.047 --> 02:08:43.482
INFORMED IN TRAUMA RESPONSE OF

02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:44.483
APPROACH.

02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:46.018
ANY WORKABLE WILL CONTINUE TO

02:08:46.085 --> 02:08:47.519
STAY BUSY IF WE ARE TREATING THE

02:08:47.586 --> 02:08:49.188
YOUTH IN THESE COMMUNITIES LIKE

02:08:49.254 --> 02:08:50.322
THERE ARE FUTURE.

02:08:50.389 --> 02:08:51.924
AND NOT THE FUTURE TO KEEP LAW

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:53.058
ENFORCEMENT INCARCERATION

02:08:53.125 --> 02:08:54.726
BUDGETS THE STATUS QUO.

02:08:54.793 --> 02:08:56.929
BUT FUTURE SCIENTISTS INVENT

02:08:56.995 --> 02:08:58.630
INVENTORS ENGINEERS UTILITY

02:08:58.697 --> 02:09:00.966
WORKERS AND EVERYTHING IN

02:09:01.033 --> 02:09:02.167
BETWEEN.

02:09:02.234 --> 02:09:02.935
WE HAVE TO TREAT OUR OUR

02:09:03.001 --> 02:09:04.970
CHILDREN HUMANELY THROUGH LOVE

02:09:05.037 --> 02:09:06.572
WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO GIVE THEM

02:09:06.638 --> 02:09:08.173
BLANK IS FULL OF SMALLPOX IN THE

02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:09.775
IN THE QUEUES THEM AND BLAME

02:09:09.842 --> 02:09:11.810
THEM AND PUNISH THEM.

02:09:11.877 --> 02:09:13.345
FOR GETTING SICK.

BUT IT'S STILL THERE -- IN A

02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:23.535
COUPLE YEARS AGO I HAD TWO

FRIENDS I GREW UP WITH.

02:12:25.871 --> 02:12:27.773
VERY CLOSE TO THEM.

02:12:27.839 --> 02:12:28.940
AND THE TWO GUYS WERE VERY CLOSE

02:12:29.007 --> 02:12:30.942
TO EACH OTHER.

02:12:31.009 --> 02:12:33.578

02:12:46.792 --> 02:12:47.926
YOU KNOW.

02:12:47.993 --> 02:12:49.628
GOING TO A FUNERAL ONE GOING TO

02:12:49.695 --> 02:12:52.764
COURT FOR THE OTHER.

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:53.398
THOSE FAMILIES WILL NEVER BE THE

02:12:53.465 --> 02:12:54.900
SAME.

02:12:54.966 --> 02:12:57.369
ARE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU

02:12:57.436 --> 02:12:57.936
WANT TO RAISE UP IN HERE IS

02:12:58.003 --> 02:12:59.438
TRAUMA.

YOU KNOW SERVICE TRAUMA.

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:03.475

USUALLY HAPPENS CAR WASH RIGHT.

02:13:06.378 --> 02:13:09.748
TO RAISE MONEY.

02:13:09.815 --> 02:13:10.282
THEN THEY HAVE THE CANDLES

02:13:20.759 --> 02:13:22.761
THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

02:13:22.828 --> 02:13:24.062
AND WHEN YOU GO TO WORKING YOU

02:13:24.129 --> 02:13:25.297
KIDS GO TO SCHOOL THEY SEE

02:13:25.364 --> 02:13:27.099
CANDLES OUT THERE AND PICTURES

02:13:27.165 --> 02:13:28.433

02:13:34.072 --> 02:13:34.573
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT

02:13:34.639 --> 02:13:36.842
MURDER.

02:13:36.908 --> 02:13:39.211
IT IT HURTS EVERYBODY

02:13:39.277 --> 02:13:39.511

02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:47.719
INSTITUTIONS.

02:13:47.786 --> 02:13:49.654
I THINK HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ARE

02:13:49.721 --> 02:13:51.556
FRAGMENTED INSTITUTIONS.

02:13:51.623 --> 02:13:53.925
WHERE OUR FAMILY?

02:13:53.992 --> 02:13:56.695
OUR CHURCHES ARE COMMUNITIES.

02:13:56.762 --> 02:13:58.930
AND IN MOST SENSES ARE FAMILIES

02:13:58.997 --> 02:14:02.300
HAVE LET DOWN OUR KIDS.

02:14:02.367 --> 02:14:02.734
THOSE ARE FRAGMENTED

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:04.403
INSTITUTIONS.

02:14:04.469 --> 02:14:05.003
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO HEAL

02:14:05.070 --> 02:14:06.972
THEM.

02:14:07.038 --> 02:14:08.240
WE REALLY NEED TO FIND A WAY HOW

02:14:08.306 --> 02:14:10.675
TO HEAL THEM.

02:14:10.742 --> 02:14:11.376
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEALTHY

02:14:11.443 --> 02:14:13.044
COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW.

02:14:13.111 --> 02:14:16.515
I LISTEN TO THIS YOUNG MAN.

02:14:16.581 --> 02:14:21.453
TWICE YOU KNOW ABOUT -- GUNS

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:23.722
ACCESS TO GUNS.

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:25.690
LOT OF THE COMMUNITIES IN YOUR

02:14:25.757 --> 02:14:29.594
WEIGHT WHERE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE.

02:14:29.661 --> 02:14:31.663
FOR ARM ARE VERY POOR.

02:14:31.730 --> 02:14:33.031
THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS

02:14:33.098 --> 02:14:35.667
ON HOW MUCH FOOD THEY PUT ON THE

02:14:35.734 --> 02:14:37.402
TABLE.

02:14:37.469 --> 02:14:38.503
HOW MUCH GAS THEY PUT THE CARD

02:14:38.570 --> 02:14:41.840
TO PAY THE REST OF THE BILLS?

02:14:41.907 --> 02:14:44.776
HOW CAN A FAMILY LIVE LIKE THAT

02:14:44.843 --> 02:14:46.445
BUT A KID IN THAT FAMILY CAN GET

02:14:46.511 --> 02:14:48.113
ACCESS TO A GUN?

02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:49.448
WHETHER IT'S HANDED DOWN TO HIM

02:14:49.514 --> 02:14:51.616
OR THE HOUSES OF TWO THREE FOUR

02:14:51.683 --> 02:14:52.217
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GET A

02:14:52.284 --> 02:14:53.285
GUN.

02:14:53.351 --> 02:14:54.986
IT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS.

02:14:55.053 --> 02:14:56.922
HOW ARE THESE GUYS GET INTO THE

02:14:56.988 --> 02:14:58.490
HANDS OF OUR KIDS?

02:14:58.557 --> 02:15:00.559
AND AS I'VE I'VE BEEN WHERE I

02:15:00.625 --> 02:15:04.229
WAS AT FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS.

02:15:04.296 --> 02:15:06.865
IN IN THE BEGINNING -- HOUSE A

02:15:06.932 --> 02:15:08.467
FIREFIGHTER.

02:15:08.533 --> 02:15:10.469
JUST GOING TO ONE INCIDENTS

02:15:10.535 --> 02:15:11.570
AFTER ANOTHER YOU KNOW ABOUT

02:15:11.636 --> 02:15:12.938
THAT.

02:15:13.004 --> 02:15:16.475
BE ENOUGH -- BY THIS BY CENTER

02:15:16.541 --> 02:15:16.741
UP THERE.

02:15:16.808 --> 02:15:18.376
SO WE'RE DOING.

02:15:18.443 --> 02:15:19.878
GOING TO ONE INCIDENT PUT IT OUT

02:15:19.945 --> 02:15:20.712
MEDIATING BACK AND FORTH BACK

02:15:20.779 --> 02:15:22.714
AND FORTH.

02:15:22.781 --> 02:15:23.682
BUT THAT'S ALL WE WERE FOR

02:15:23.748 --> 02:15:24.649
THAT'S ALL I WAS FOR AWHILE TO

02:15:24.716 --> 02:15:25.984
MY KIND OF STARTED FIGURING OUT

02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:26.384
THINGS [inaudible]

02:15:26.451 --> 02:15:28.420
IN ALL.

02:15:28.487 --> 02:15:29.488
BEING REACTIVE.

02:15:29.554 --> 02:15:32.858
IT'S NOT HAPPENING -- WE HAVE TO

02:15:32.924 --> 02:15:34.125
BE IN A STATE WHERE WERE MORE

02:15:34.192 --> 02:15:35.594
PROACTIVE.

02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:37.262
I HAD TO LEARN YOU KNOW I

02:15:37.329 --> 02:15:39.531
THERE'S A CITY ATTORNEY YOU

02:15:39.598 --> 02:15:40.632
MIGHT NOR EVE SHADY.

02:15:40.699 --> 02:15:42.601
SHE'S A CITY ATTORNEY THAT WAS

02:15:42.667 --> 02:15:44.536
WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES.

02:15:44.603 --> 02:15:46.705
AND SHE BASICALLY RUNS THE

02:15:46.771 --> 02:15:48.406
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

02:15:48.473 --> 02:15:50.675
YOU KNOW SHE OVERSEEING THAT.

02:15:50.742 --> 02:15:52.244
I HAD TO LEARN A LOT FROM HER

02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:53.845
ABOUT THE V..

02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:54.946
NOT THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:15:55.013 --> 02:15:56.781
COMPONENT YES.

02:15:56.848 --> 02:15:58.116
BUT ABOUT VIOLENCE IN THE CYCLE

02:15:58.183 --> 02:16:00.385
OF VIOLENCE AND HOW KIDS GROW UP

BUT THEY COME HOME AND STILL DO

02:22:39.317 --> 02:22:40.218
WHAT THEY DO IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT

02:22:55.033 --> 02:22:56.734
SO DEEP BUT DO YOU SEE THAT

02:22:56.801 --> 02:22:57.402
THERE ARE MANY NOT YOU KNOW I I

02:22:57.468 --> 02:22:59.404
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE WHO'VE GOTTEN

02:22:59.470 --> 02:23:00.838
SHOT AT THEIR JOB.

02:23:00.905 --> 02:23:02.807

BUT I'M STILL GETTING BACK AT IT

02:23:12.450 --> 02:23:15.153
SO IT'S IT'S IT'S THE MIND SAID

02:23:15.219 --> 02:23:16.154
NOT JUST THE EMPLOYMENT YES

02:23:16.220 --> 02:23:17.488
POVERTY -- DEPRESSION AND

SUBSTANCE ABUSE ALL OF THESE

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:21.993
THINGS HAVE PLAYED A ROLE -- BUT

02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:40.445
OTHERS WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE

02:23:40.511 --> 02:23:41.346

BUT I GET INVOLVED.

02:23:54.459 --> 02:23:55.693
I HAVE THAT KIND OF AUTHORITY I

GOT YOU STUCK MORE TEARS RATE

02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:05.303
YOU RAISE A POINT WHEN YOU GAVE

02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:06.971

OF MY WORK THE ANYWAY -- BECAUSE

02:24:10.775 --> 02:24:12.643
WE STILL HAVE NO FEDERAL GUN

02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:14.712
LAWS INTERVENING CALIFORNIA

02:24:14.779 --> 02:24:16.381
CONTINUES LEAD THE WAY WHEN IT

02:24:16.447 --> 02:24:18.149
COMES DOWN TO GUN CONTROL AND

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:19.517
YOU DEMONSTRATE THROUGH YOUR

02:24:19.584 --> 02:24:22.653
ANALYSIS TO SHOW THAT YOU KNOW

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:23.988
GUNS COMING FROM ARIZONA.

02:24:24.055 --> 02:24:25.089
COMING IN FROM THE BATTER INTO

02:24:25.156 --> 02:24:26.858
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF OUR GUN

02:24:26.924 --> 02:24:28.192
LAWS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET HIM

02:24:28.259 --> 02:24:29.260
HERE AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO

02:24:29.327 --> 02:24:30.395
THE INTERNET.

02:24:30.461 --> 02:24:32.030
OR THE GOING THROUGH THE THE

02:24:32.096 --> 02:24:34.265
THREE D. PRINTER AND MAKING A WE

02:24:34.332 --> 02:24:35.700
CALLED GOALS GUNS HAVE A BILL A

02:24:35.767 --> 02:24:37.935
A. B. -- EIGHT SEVENTY NINE TO

02:24:38.002 --> 02:24:40.304
HOPEFULLY ADDRESS -- THIS

02:24:40.371 --> 02:24:40.938
PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE WE SEE

02:24:41.005 --> 02:24:41.372
IT.

02:24:41.439 --> 02:24:43.474
A HUSBAND WIFE WAS MANUFACTURING

02:24:43.541 --> 02:24:45.610
GOES GUNS MY IN MY DISTRICT AND

02:24:45.676 --> 02:24:46.811
BOTH OF THOSE ARRESTED OF OPEN

02:24:46.878 --> 02:24:48.946
PLED GUILTY BUT THEN YOU ALSO

02:24:49.013 --> 02:24:50.515
HAVE ANOTHER GERMAN WHO WAS

02:24:50.581 --> 02:24:51.849
MAKING GHOST GUNS.

02:24:51.916 --> 02:24:58.356
WHO PLED NOT GUILTY WHO WAS

02:24:58.423 --> 02:24:58.890
SELLING GUNS THE CRIPS AND

02:24:58.956 --> 02:25:00.525
BLOODS?

02:25:00.591 --> 02:25:01.793
SO THROUGH THROUGH THAT I JUST

02:25:01.859 --> 02:25:02.960
WANT TO RESPOND THAT WE'RE DOING

02:25:03.027 --> 02:25:04.595
EVERYTHING WE CAN BUT A LESSON

02:25:04.662 --> 02:25:05.863
OF A NERVE THAT NEVADA OR

02:25:05.930 --> 02:25:07.799
ARIZONA HAVE STRICT DRUNK YOU

02:25:07.865 --> 02:25:08.166
KNOW GUN LAWS.

02:25:08.232 --> 02:25:08.699
THEY WILL STILL HAVE THE

02:25:08.766 --> 02:25:09.734
PROLIFERATION OF THAT COMING

02:25:09.801 --> 02:25:11.636
INTO CALIFORNIA BUT THE REAL

02:25:11.702 --> 02:25:13.638
ISSUE IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:25:13.704 --> 02:25:15.306
REFUSED TO ACT IN THIS SPACE

02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:16.474
YOUR COMMENTS YEAH.

02:25:16.541 --> 02:25:19.544
THAT'S A SEVERE LIMITATION OF

02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:20.912
OFFERS ON THE BACK TO YOUR POINT

02:25:20.978 --> 02:25:22.246
TO THE THE THE NORMS ARE.

02:25:22.313 --> 02:25:23.648
PART OF WHAT I'VE BEEN TALKING

02:25:23.714 --> 02:25:25.550
ABOUT TODAY TO THE MOTIVATION.

02:25:25.616 --> 02:25:26.851
TO HAVE THE GUN RIGHT IF YOU

02:25:26.918 --> 02:25:28.853
HAVE IF YOU'RE BROKEN PERSON

02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:30.088
YOU'RE ANGRY LIKE YOU SAID RIGHT.

02:25:30.154 --> 02:25:31.689
THAT'S THAT'S A FACTOR SO THEN

02:25:31.756 --> 02:25:32.824
THE ACCESS PART.

02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:34.292
IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO TALK

02:25:34.358 --> 02:25:35.193
ABOUT TO BE.

02:25:35.259 --> 02:25:36.727
AND SO DESPITE THE FEDERAL

02:25:36.794 --> 02:25:40.364
LIMITATIONS RIGHT OF NOT HAVING.

02:25:40.431 --> 02:25:43.434
A UNIVERSAL -- STANDARDIZE --

02:25:43.501 --> 02:25:46.437
STRICT SET OF LAWS IN PLACE WHAT

02:25:46.504 --> 02:25:48.406
WE CAN DO WE HAVE TO KIND OF

02:25:48.473 --> 02:25:49.507
THINK ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO.

02:25:49.574 --> 02:25:54.011
AND I REALLY THINK THAT HAVING A

02:25:54.078 --> 02:25:55.113
DATABASE.

02:25:55.179 --> 02:25:56.848
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:25:56.914 --> 02:25:58.783
AND AT THE STATE LEVEL.

02:25:58.850 --> 02:26:00.852
WHAT AT LEAST ALLOW US TO HAVE

02:26:00.918 --> 02:26:03.988
BETTER DATA? TO GO AFTER THESE

02:26:04.055 --> 02:26:07.525
DEALERS IN PLACES LIKE NEVADA.

02:26:07.592 --> 02:26:09.160
OR ARIZONA BECAUSE WHY BECAUSE

02:26:09.227 --> 02:26:11.229
THAT'S A FEDERAL CRIME

02:26:11.295 --> 02:26:12.597
TRAFFICKING GUNS.

02:26:12.663 --> 02:26:15.233
OVER STATE LINES RIGHT.

02:26:15.299 --> 02:26:17.502
AND SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE

02:26:17.568 --> 02:26:19.036
PLACE TO START.

02:26:19.103 --> 02:26:20.605
DESPITE THE LIMITATIONS AND LAW

02:26:20.671 --> 02:26:22.140
ENFORCEMENT WHEN THERE'S A

02:26:22.206 --> 02:26:23.341
HOMICIDE THESE DETECTIVES.

02:26:23.407 --> 02:26:25.810
DATE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

02:26:25.877 --> 02:26:27.044
THAT THEY WANT TO DO THIS WHAT

02:26:27.111 --> 02:26:28.513
THEY'LL LONG FOR SIZE TALK TO ME.

02:26:28.579 --> 02:26:31.149
IS -- GETTING THE GUN.

02:26:31.215 --> 02:26:32.183
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY

02:26:32.250 --> 02:26:34.085
PROSECUTE ANYONE IN A COURT OF

02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:35.920
LAW RIGHT SO THEY GET THE GUN.

02:26:35.987 --> 02:26:37.355
AND THEN THEY WANT TO FIND OUT.

02:26:37.421 --> 02:26:38.856
WHOSE GUN IS IT WHERE DID THE

02:26:38.923 --> 02:26:40.224
GUN.

02:26:40.291 --> 02:26:41.792
COME FROM HOW DID END UP IN YOUR

02:26:41.859 --> 02:26:43.561
HAND SO THAT INFORMATION IS

02:26:43.628 --> 02:26:44.962
COLLECTED.

02:26:45.029 --> 02:26:45.997
WHEN THEY DO GET THE GUN AND BY

02:26:46.063 --> 02:26:47.431
THE WAY LAW ENFORCEMENT TOLD ME

02:26:47.498 --> 02:26:49.133
THEY ONLY GET THE GUNS IN

02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:51.435
HOMICIDES ABOUT 40% OF THE TIME

02:26:51.502 --> 02:26:52.336
MAYBE THIRTIES THEY DON'T ALWAYS

02:26:52.403 --> 02:26:53.204
GET HIM?

02:26:53.271 --> 02:26:54.505
BUT IF THEY KEPT BETTER DATA AT

02:26:54.572 --> 02:26:57.208
THE STATE REQUIRED THEM TO KEEP

02:26:57.275 --> 02:27:00.044
BETTER DATA AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:27:00.111 --> 02:27:01.445
AND IF THE STATE MAINTAINED A

02:27:01.512 --> 02:27:03.948
BETTER DATABASE OF THESE GUNS

02:27:04.015 --> 02:27:05.383
AND WERE ABLE.

02:27:05.449 --> 02:27:06.751
TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH

02:27:06.817 --> 02:27:08.452
OTHER CITIES.

02:27:08.519 --> 02:27:09.687
THAT WOULD EMPOWER THE STATE OF

02:27:09.754 --> 02:27:12.223
CALIFORNIA. TO PROSECUTE THE

02:27:12.290 --> 02:27:14.625
STATE'S AND BRING THE ISSUE.

02:27:14.692 --> 02:27:16.160
ELEVATE THE ISSUE AT THE FEDERAL

02:27:16.227 --> 02:27:17.361
LEVEL BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE

02:27:17.428 --> 02:27:21.365
TECHNICALLY A FEDERAL CRIME.

02:27:21.432 --> 02:27:22.733
SO THERE IS THAT SO THAT WAS THE

02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:24.702
FIRST ANSWER THE GHOST GUNS --

02:27:24.769 --> 02:27:25.970
THAT'S A REAL CHALLENGE LIKE TO

02:27:26.037 --> 02:27:27.371
HEAR MORE ABOUT YOUR BILL

02:27:27.438 --> 02:27:28.472
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO SERIAL

02:27:28.539 --> 02:27:29.740
NUMBERS I GUESS SO THEN THE

02:27:29.807 --> 02:27:31.209
ISSUE WOULD BE THE THREE D.

02:27:31.275 --> 02:27:33.177
PRINTER BUT ALL ALL ALL ALL I

02:27:33.244 --> 02:27:34.645
WANNA LEARN FROM YOU ON THAT BUT

02:27:34.712 --> 02:27:36.414
THAT'S MY ANSWER TO THE FIRST

02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:37.114
PART OF YOUR QUESTION.

02:27:37.181 --> 02:27:40.318
THANK YOU REVISED YOU KNOW EVERY

02:27:40.384 --> 02:27:42.753
TIME MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT THE

ACROSS THE AISLE -- AND DOES NOT.

02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:47.625
A LET IT -- THEY HAVE ALWAYS

02:27:47.692 --> 02:27:49.360
PUSHED BACK AND THEY SAID.

02:27:49.427 --> 02:27:52.430
PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE GUNS DOESN'T

02:27:52.496 --> 02:27:54.165
KILL PEOPLE WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE

02:27:54.232 --> 02:27:55.032
TO THAT.

02:27:55.099 --> 02:27:57.101
GO BACK TO MY DEFINITION OF GUN

02:27:57.168 --> 02:27:58.603
VIOLENCE AT THE BEGINNING RIGHT.

02:27:58.669 --> 02:28:00.438
VIOLENCE THE PROPENSITY THE

02:28:00.504 --> 02:28:04.642
VIOLENCE IS WHAT DRIVES -- GUN

02:28:04.709 --> 02:28:05.543
VIOLENCE RIGHT THAT'S THAT YOU

02:28:05.610 --> 02:28:06.811
HAVE TO HAVE VIOLENCE YOU HAVE

02:28:06.877 --> 02:28:08.112
TO HAVE THIS VIOLENCE WE HAVE TO

02:28:08.179 --> 02:28:09.647
ADDRESS VIOLENCE.

02:28:09.714 --> 02:28:11.115
IN SO WHAT GUNS DO IS THEY

02:28:11.182 --> 02:28:13.150
INTENSIFY THE VIOLENCE GO BACK

02:28:13.217 --> 02:28:14.252
TO MY THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:28:14.318 --> 02:28:15.820
ISSUE YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT'S

02:28:15.886 --> 02:28:17.121
PREDISPOSED.

02:28:17.188 --> 02:28:18.556
TO COMMIT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:28:18.623 --> 02:28:20.157
AGAINST THEIR PARTNER IT'S GOING

02:28:20.224 --> 02:28:21.425
TO GET VIOLENT BE PUT A GUN IN

02:28:21.492 --> 02:28:22.426
THEIR HANDS.

02:28:22.493 --> 02:28:24.328
AND THEN DOUBTS WOULD THAT'S THE

02:28:24.395 --> 02:28:26.831

AND YOU NEED TO AND THAT'S HOW

02:28:29.133 --> 02:28:30.501
WE GET HIGHER HOMICIDE RATES

02:28:30.568 --> 02:28:32.403
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT --

02:28:32.470 --> 02:28:33.738
WITH POINT ONE TWO FINAL

02:28:33.804 --> 02:28:35.106

THEY WE GOT TO REALIZE THAT

02:30:17.241 --> 02:30:19.677

LIKE THAT THE BRING A MAN --

02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:54.231
ALSO WITH THE RISE OF

02:32:54.298 --> 02:32:55.866
AUTHORITARIANISM THE RISE OF

02:32:55.933 --> 02:32:57.868
FASCISM IN THIS COUNTRY AND

02:33:05.809 --> 02:33:07.177
GOVERNMENT TO BECOME A MORE

02:33:07.244 --> 02:33:09.280
AUTHORITARIAN -- SO AS

BUT ANYWAYS I THINK FOR SOME

02:33:17.288 --> 02:33:20.190
SOLUTIONS -- TO COME BACK ON

02:33:20.257 --> 02:33:21.458
VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE

02:33:21.525 --> 02:33:22.793
FIRST THING I THINK WOULD BE TO

END THE WARRING GANGS SO I MEANS

02:33:24.695 --> 02:33:26.463
ENDING GANG INJUNCTIONS ENDING

02:33:26.530 --> 02:33:28.032

EVERYBODY HERE ALREADY KNOWS.

02:51:13.930 --> 02:51:15.064
THE FIRST THING TO KNOW IS THAT --

02:51:15.131 --> 02:51:16.933
LA COUNTY HAS BEEN EPICENTER OF

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:18.067
HANDGUN MANUFACTURING AND

02:51:18.134 --> 02:51:19.702
DISTRIBUTION FOR THE WORLD FOR A

02:51:19.769 --> 02:51:20.703
LONG TIME.

02:51:20.770 --> 02:51:22.171
UNTIL JUST A FEW YEARS AGO THERE

02:51:22.238 --> 02:51:23.539
THAT AREA OF THE ORANGE COUNTY

02:51:23.606 --> 02:51:25.308
LA COUNTY AND I'M RIVERSIDE

02:51:25.375 --> 02:51:25.975
COUNTY WAS KNOWN AS THE RING OF

02:51:26.042 --> 02:51:26.876
FIRE.

02:51:26.943 --> 02:51:29.245
EVEN THE FBI SAID THAT ABOUT 86%

02:51:29.312 --> 02:51:30.847
OF THE HANDGUN CRIMES IN UNITED

02:51:30.913 --> 02:51:32.181
STATES WERE ATTRIBUTED BACK TO A

02:51:32.248 --> 02:51:33.449
GUN CREATED RIGHT THERE.

02:51:33.516 --> 02:51:34.117
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

02:51:34.183 --> 02:51:35.118
INTERNAL DOCUMENTS OF THOSE

02:51:35.184 --> 02:51:37.453
COMPANIES MANY OF THEM HAD --

02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:38.988
DOCUMENTS THAT STATED THAT A LOT

02:51:39.055 --> 02:51:40.256
OF THEIR GUNS DISAPPEARED ON THE

02:51:40.323 --> 02:51:42.458
WAY TO THE TRAIN YARDS -- IN THE

02:51:42.525 --> 02:51:43.760
EAST SIDE OR ON THE WAY TO THE

02:51:43.826 --> 02:51:46.162
ON PORTS ON THE SOUTH SIDE.

AND YET WHO GOT BLAMED FOR GUN

02:51:47.830 --> 02:51:49.198
VIOLENCE IN LOS ANGELES IN THE

02:51:49.265 --> 02:51:50.867
NATION YOUNG BLACK AND BROWN

02:51:50.933 --> 02:51:52.869
YOUTH ESPECIALLY MEN -- THOSE

02:51:52.935 --> 02:51:55.104
COMPANIES MADE HUGE PROFITS AND

02:51:55.171 --> 02:51:56.372
STILL HAVE YET TO PAY A PEACE

02:51:56.439 --> 02:51:57.774
DIVIDEND BACK TO THE COMMUNITY

02:51:57.840 --> 02:52:00.376

WHITE COMING UP KNOWS CAN USE

02:52:01.511 --> 02:52:03.012
ALL THE LEAST IMPACTED BUT GUN

02:52:03.079 --> 02:52:04.747
VIOLENCE IN IN MY FAMILY AND IN

02:52:04.814 --> 02:52:05.682
MY COMMUNITY WAS AN EVERYDAY

02:52:05.748 --> 02:52:07.016
REALITY SO.

02:52:07.083 --> 02:52:09.085
WHETHER IT WAS RUNNING FROM GUNS --

02:52:09.152 --> 02:52:10.319
BEING ONE TIME IN A CAR WHERE

02:52:10.386 --> 02:52:12.221
SOMEONE PUT A GUN OUTSIDE TO MY

02:52:12.288 --> 02:52:13.956
FOREHEAD AND THEN -- CHASED US

02:52:14.023 --> 02:52:16.259
FOR BLOCKS OR FINDING MY OWN

02:52:16.325 --> 02:52:17.660
FAMILY'S GUN BEHIND THE LIQUOR

02:52:17.727 --> 02:52:19.696
BOTTLES -- BECAUSE IT WAS REAL

02:52:19.762 --> 02:52:21.664
CLEAR IN OUR HOUSE THAT -- AND

02:52:21.731 --> 02:52:22.799
IN MOST HOUSES THAT WHEN

02:52:22.865 --> 02:52:24.300
VIOLENCE HAPPENS IS USUALLY

02:52:24.367 --> 02:52:25.702
LIQUOR INVOLVED AND THAT'S THE

02:52:25.768 --> 02:52:29.672
WORST PLACE TO PUT A GUN BUT

02:52:29.739 --> 02:52:30.273
OFTEN A COMMON PLACE TO PUT A

02:52:30.339 --> 02:52:31.407
GUN.

02:52:31.474 --> 02:52:32.241
THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY IS

02:52:32.308 --> 02:52:33.509
THAT -- LA COUNTY ALSO HAS BEEN

02:52:33.576 --> 02:52:34.043
THE EPICENTER FOR POLICE

02:52:34.110 --> 02:52:34.877

02:52:34.944 --> 02:52:36.979
BUT THE WORLD -- WE HAD POLICE

02:52:37.046 --> 02:52:38.247

THAT THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE.

02:52:48.324 --> 02:52:49.625
AND THAT THAT'S WHERE THE

02:52:49.692 --> 02:52:51.094
ORIGINAL TERMS AROUND GANG

02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:52.462
VIOLENCE CAME FROM.

02:52:52.528 --> 02:52:54.030
SOMEONE BROWN PEOPLE FOUGHT BACK

IMMEDIATELY LABELED AS BANDITS

02:52:58.234 --> 02:52:58.768
AND THAT'S WHERE THAT LYNCHING

02:52:58.835 --> 02:52:59.602
RAY CAME FROM.

02:52:59.669 --> 02:53:01.604
WHEN CHINESE PEOPLE WERE SEEN AS

02:53:01.671 --> 02:53:02.371
A THREAT BECAUSE THEY WERE

02:53:02.438 --> 02:53:03.439
MOVING INTO LA COUNTY USED IN

WAS ACCIDENTALLY KILLED.

02:53:10.413 --> 02:53:11.614
THAT WAS USE AN EXCUSE TO TO

02:53:11.681 --> 02:53:14.050
BURN DOWN CHINATOWN AND STILL BY

02:53:14.117 --> 02:53:15.151
MATT ELIAS MASS LYNCHING IN US

02:53:15.218 --> 02:53:17.019
HISTORY EIGHTEEN PEOPLE LYNCHED

02:53:17.086 --> 02:53:18.387
AND AS MANY AS EIGHTY THREE

02:53:18.454 --> 02:53:19.355
PEOPLE KILLED THAT NIGHT.

02:53:19.422 --> 02:53:21.090
AND SO LAW ENFORCEMENT LED THOSE

02:53:21.157 --> 02:53:22.859
EFFORTS IN LA COUNTY AND IN

02:53:22.925 --> 02:53:25.461
CALIFORNIA -- IT WAS ALSO THE

02:53:25.528 --> 02:53:26.662
TIME OF THE MORE THE HIGHEST

02:53:26.729 --> 02:53:27.697
EXTERMINATION NATIVE PEOPLE IN

02:53:27.764 --> 02:53:29.198
THE UNITED STATES NOT TO SAY IT

02:53:29.265 --> 02:53:31.000
DIDN'T HAPPEN EVERYWHERE BUT 90%

02:53:31.067 --> 02:53:31.834
THE NATIVE POPULATION WAS WIPED

02:53:31.901 --> 02:53:32.802
OUT.

02:53:32.869 --> 02:53:34.537
AND ALL OF THAT HAPPENED RIGHT

02:53:34.604 --> 02:53:36.072
BEFORE THE CREATION OF OUR USE

02:53:36.139 --> 02:53:37.840
OF FOR STANDARD SO ARE YOU SO

02:53:37.907 --> 02:53:39.108
FOR STANDARD WAS USED AS A AS A

02:53:39.175 --> 02:53:41.611
OPPORTUNITY OR IS A RESOURCE TO

02:53:41.677 --> 02:53:42.879
EXCUSE ALL THOSE ACTIONS BY LAW

02:53:42.945 --> 02:53:43.613
ENFORCEMENT.

02:53:43.679 --> 02:53:45.081
AND WE'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THAT

02:53:45.148 --> 02:53:46.516
CULTURE OF VIOLENCE EVER SINCE

02:53:46.582 --> 02:53:47.917
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOUNG

02:53:47.984 --> 02:53:48.951
PEOPLE OR COMMUNITIES BEING

02:53:49.018 --> 02:53:51.053
VIOLENT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHERE

02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:52.321
THE VIOLENCE COMES FROM -- THE

02:53:52.388 --> 02:53:53.523
SECOND THING I THINK IS REALLY

02:53:53.589 --> 02:53:55.191
ESSENTIAL TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW

02:53:55.258 --> 02:53:56.559
MILITARIZATION OF POLICE STILL

02:53:56.626 --> 02:53:57.994
EXISTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I

02:53:58.060 --> 02:53:59.395
UNLIKE ANTHONY I DON'T THINK

02:53:59.462 --> 02:54:00.897
THAT WE SHOULD BE ARMED I DON'T

02:54:00.963 --> 02:54:02.398
WANT ANY OF US HAVE GUNS HAVING

02:54:02.465 --> 02:54:03.099
HAD GUNS PULLED ON ME.

02:54:03.166 --> 02:54:04.433
I'M VERY AFRAID OF GUNS AND I'M

02:54:04.500 --> 02:54:05.968
ALSO VERY RESPECTFUL OF WHAT

02:54:06.035 --> 02:54:07.937
THEY CAN DO AND I PERSONALLY

02:54:08.004 --> 02:54:09.505
DON'T TRUST ANYBODY WITH A GUN --

02:54:09.572 --> 02:54:11.674
SO I I WOULD BE HAPPY OF ALL

02:54:11.741 --> 02:54:13.743
GUNS REMOVED FROM THE PLANET AND

02:54:13.810 --> 02:54:14.777
I I AND I'M GLAD FOR TOUGH GUN

02:54:14.844 --> 02:54:15.578
CONTROL.

02:54:15.645 --> 02:54:16.913
BUT THAT BEING SAID WE'RE NOT

02:54:16.979 --> 02:54:18.581
DOING ANYTHING TO ADDRESS THE

02:54:18.648 --> 02:54:19.148
INCREASED MILITARIZATION OF

02:54:19.215 --> 02:54:20.016
POLICING.

02:54:20.082 --> 02:54:22.018
SO FOR EXAMPLE -- OUR SCHOOLS

02:54:22.084 --> 02:54:23.753
LOOK AND OPERATE A LOT MORE LIKE

02:54:23.820 --> 02:54:25.321
PRISONS -- THAN THEY USED TO

02:54:25.388 --> 02:54:31.961
WITH SECURITY FENCING

02:54:32.028 --> 02:54:33.296
SURROUNDING THEM WITH YOUNG

02:54:33.362 --> 02:54:33.863
PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH METAL

02:54:33.930 --> 02:54:34.463
DETECTORS WITH POLICE TAKING

02:54:34.530 --> 02:54:35.198
OVER SCHOOL SECURITY.

02:54:35.264 --> 02:54:36.432
MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOW HAVE

02:54:36.499 --> 02:54:38.301
POLICE SCHOOL DEPARTMENTS -- LOS

02:54:38.367 --> 02:54:39.202
ANGELES UNIFIED AS A LARGEST

02:54:39.268 --> 02:54:39.836
SCHOOL POLICE DEPARTMENT IN THE

02:54:39.902 --> 02:54:40.937
NATION WE HAVE MORE POLICE AND

02:54:41.003 --> 02:54:42.038
PROBATION OFFICERS ON OUR

02:54:42.104 --> 02:54:42.638
SCHOOLS THAN WE DO GUIDANCE

02:54:42.705 --> 02:54:43.306
COUNSELORS.

02:54:43.372 --> 02:54:44.841
AND CALIFORNIA BEING THE RICHEST

02:54:44.907 --> 02:54:47.543
STATE IN THE COUNTRY AND THE

02:54:47.610 --> 02:54:48.611
FIFTH WHAT IS THE FIFTH LARGEST

02:54:48.678 --> 02:54:50.479
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD NOW -- WE

02:54:50.546 --> 02:54:52.048
HAVE THE LOWEST RATIO -- SCHOOL

02:54:52.114 --> 02:54:54.350
COUNSELORS TO STUDENTS WITH ONE

02:54:54.417 --> 02:54:56.719
COUNSELOR FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND

02:54:56.786 --> 02:54:58.087
SIXTEEN STUDENTS THEN YET WHERE

02:54:58.154 --> 02:54:59.789
THE MOST MILITARIZED SCHOOLS.

02:54:59.856 --> 02:55:01.324
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY TO

02:55:01.390 --> 02:55:02.658
THAT A LOT OF THIS CAME AFTER

02:55:02.725 --> 02:55:05.261
COLUMBINE -- BUT IN CALIFORNIA

02:55:05.328 --> 02:55:06.829
IT CAME PRE COLUMBINE.

02:55:06.896 --> 02:55:08.030
WE WERE ALREADY MILITARIZE IN

02:55:08.097 --> 02:55:10.032
OUR SCHOOLS LONG BEFORE THERE

02:55:10.099 --> 02:55:11.400
WAS A SCHOOL VIOLENCE CRISIS.

02:55:11.467 --> 02:55:12.768
AND THEN EVEN IF YOU TALK ABOUT

02:55:12.835 --> 02:55:14.737
COLUMBINE AS A SCHOOL SHOOTING

02:55:14.804 --> 02:55:16.072
EPICENTER LIKE A BEGINNING OF A

02:55:16.138 --> 02:55:18.274
CONVERSATION ABOUT LOCKING DOWN

02:55:18.341 --> 02:55:18.841
SCHOOLS WE LOOK MORE LIKE

02:55:18.908 --> 02:55:19.742
PRISONS.

02:55:19.809 --> 02:55:20.843
IF YOU LOOK AT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

02:55:20.910 --> 02:55:22.178
GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE

02:55:22.245 --> 02:55:22.812
SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS IN THE UNITED

02:55:22.879 --> 02:55:25.114
STATES 98% THE SHOOTERS WERE

02:55:25.181 --> 02:55:27.850
WHITE 9896% OF THE VICTIMS WERE

02:55:27.917 --> 02:55:29.652
WHITE ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE

02:55:29.719 --> 02:55:30.553
SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS.

02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:32.121
YET THE SCHOOL THEY GET LOCKED

02:55:32.188 --> 02:55:33.756
DOWN OUR COMMUNITY IN INCOME IS

02:55:33.823 --> 02:55:34.924
A COLOR COMBINE STILL DOESN'T

02:55:34.991 --> 02:55:37.193
HAVE FENCING AROUND IT STILL HAS

02:55:37.260 --> 02:55:38.427
ONLY ONE METAL DETECTORS SANDY

02:55:38.494 --> 02:55:39.128
HOOK THOSE SCHOOLS IN THAT

02:55:39.195 --> 02:55:39.695
DISTRICT.

02:55:39.762 --> 02:55:41.397
STILL HAVE NO METAL DETECTORS

02:55:41.464 --> 02:55:42.865
AND FENCING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

02:55:42.932 --> 02:55:44.300
THAT KIND OF CLIMATE IS NOT

02:55:44.367 --> 02:55:45.368
CONDUCIVE TO LEARNING.

02:55:45.434 --> 02:55:47.637
AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES NEVER

02:55:47.703 --> 02:55:49.038
GET TO NEVER INDOOR THOSE KIND

02:55:49.105 --> 02:55:50.406
OF QUALITIES AND SO THESCHOOLS

02:55:50.473 --> 02:55:52.275
THAT HAVE NOT HAD POLICE

02:55:52.341 --> 02:55:53.342
VIOLENCE HE'S HUGE MASS

02:55:53.409 --> 02:55:54.210
SHOOTINGS.

02:55:54.277 --> 02:55:56.646
HAVE GOTTEN ALL THE LOCKDOWN --

02:55:56.712 --> 02:55:57.980
POLICE IN SCHOOLS SO WE NEED TO

02:55:58.047 --> 02:55:59.081
MAKE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO

02:55:59.148 --> 02:56:01.183
REMOVE POLICING FROM SCHOOLS AND

02:56:01.250 --> 02:56:02.852
TO DEMILITARIZE OUR SCHOOLS AND

02:56:02.919 --> 02:56:04.086
OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:56:04.153 --> 02:56:06.055
SIMILARLY OUT OF LA COUNTY CAME

02:56:06.122 --> 02:56:08.024
MILITARIZED POLICING SO THE

02:56:08.090 --> 02:56:09.191
FIRST CREATION OF SWAT OUT OF LA

02:56:09.258 --> 02:56:10.826
COUNTY THE FIRST USE OF

02:56:10.893 --> 02:56:11.827
HELICOPTERS BY THE SHERIFF'S

02:56:11.894 --> 02:56:15.531
AGAINST A CIVILIAN POPULATION --

02:56:15.598 --> 02:56:18.935
TAKE DOWN DOORS AND THOSE THOSE.

02:56:19.001 --> 02:56:19.735
THOSE ARE MECHANISMS OF POLICING

02:56:19.802 --> 02:56:20.770
HAVE NOW SPREAD NATIONWIDE AND

02:56:20.836 --> 02:56:22.071
WORLDWIDE IT'S WHAT WE'VE

02:56:22.138 --> 02:56:23.005
EXPORTED TO THE REST OF THE

02:56:23.072 --> 02:56:24.006
WORLD.

02:56:24.073 --> 02:56:25.775
SIMILARLY YOU KNOW LA COUNTY IS

02:56:25.841 --> 02:56:31.480
CALLED LIKE THE YOU KNOW THE

02:56:31.547 --> 02:56:33.716
BEGINNING A GANG ACTIVITIES CALL

02:56:33.783 --> 02:56:34.984
GANG ACTIVITY WOULD I WAS A

02:56:35.051 --> 02:56:35.484
NEIGHBORHOOD ACTIVITY.

02:56:35.551 --> 02:56:36.585
BUT FOR DEPORTATION WE NOW HAVE

02:56:36.652 --> 02:56:37.820
TAKEN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS

02:56:37.887 --> 02:56:38.955
INTERNATIONAL TO ALL BECAUSE

02:56:39.021 --> 02:56:39.588
WE'VE DEPORTED PEOPLE OUT OF ALL

02:56:39.655 --> 02:56:40.623
THE COUNTY INSTEAD OF DEALING

02:56:40.690 --> 02:56:41.490
WITH OUR VIOLENCE AT HOME --

02:56:41.557 --> 02:56:42.992
LASTLY I WOULD SAY THAT THERE IS

02:56:43.059 --> 02:56:43.559
A MYTH THAT KEEPS GIVING POP

02:56:43.626 --> 02:56:44.794
PROMOTED EVERY TIME WE BRING UP

02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:46.262
POLICEVIOLENCE -- WITH LAW

02:56:46.329 --> 02:56:47.330
ENFORCEMENT OR OTHERS IN LA

02:56:47.396 --> 02:56:49.865
COUNTY HAS BY FAR THE HIGHEST

02:56:49.932 --> 02:56:51.300
USE OF FORCE RESULTING IN

02:56:51.367 --> 02:56:52.902
HOMICIDE IN THE NATION -- IT

02:56:52.969 --> 02:56:54.603
WITH AT LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED AND

02:56:54.670 --> 02:56:55.771
SEVENTY FOUR PEOPLE KILLED IN LA

02:56:55.838 --> 02:56:58.674
COUNTY BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND

02:56:58.741 --> 02:56:59.875
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BETWEEN

02:56:59.942 --> 02:57:01.610
200-020-0017 EIGHT HUNDRED AND

02:57:01.677 --> 02:57:03.379
FIFTY FOUR AT LEAST KILLED -- WE

02:57:03.446 --> 02:57:04.613
HAVEN'T EVEN DONE THE NUMBERS AS

02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:05.381
WELL WE CAN'T GIVE AN EXACT

02:57:05.448 --> 02:57:07.183
ESTIMATE EXACT NUMBER FOR THE

02:57:07.249 --> 02:57:08.684
LAST YEAR -- SO WE'RE NOT EVEN

02:57:08.751 --> 02:57:11.287
CLOSE TO NEW YORK NOT EVEN CLOSE --

02:57:11.354 --> 02:57:12.755
TO CHICAGO AND OTHER CITIES

02:57:12.822 --> 02:57:13.422
WHERE THEY HAVE POLICE VIOLENCE

02:57:13.489 --> 02:57:14.256
PROBLEMS.

02:57:14.323 --> 02:57:15.124
AND I THINK ONE OF THE KEY

02:57:15.191 --> 02:57:17.226
REASONS FOR THAT IS BECAUSE WE

02:57:17.293 --> 02:57:18.861
HAVE THE WARRING GANGS IN THE

02:57:18.928 --> 02:57:19.662
WAR ON DRUGS CAME OUT OF LA

02:57:19.729 --> 02:57:21.764
COUNTY THAT WAS SPREAD WORLDWIDE.

02:57:21.831 --> 02:57:23.032
AND IT CREATES A CULTURE OF

02:57:23.099 --> 02:57:24.900
LOCKDOWN CONTAINMENT AND CONTROL

02:57:24.967 --> 02:57:26.402
WHICH IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS

02:57:26.469 --> 02:57:27.770
FOR COMMUNITIES.

02:57:27.837 --> 02:57:28.971
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:57:29.038 --> 02:57:29.839
HAVE TO DO IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:57:29.905 --> 02:57:31.307
CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE IS CHANGE

02:57:31.374 --> 02:57:33.275
THE NARRATIVE ABOUT BLACK ON

02:57:33.342 --> 02:57:33.809
BLACK AND BROWN AND BROWN

02:57:33.876 --> 02:57:36.479
VIOLENCE -- BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE

02:57:36.545 --> 02:57:37.513
IS A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE THAT

02:57:37.580 --> 02:57:38.814
COMES FROM OUR GOVERNMENT AND

02:57:38.881 --> 02:57:40.016
THE WAY THAT COMMUNITIES ARE

02:57:40.082 --> 02:57:40.850
PATROLLED.

02:57:40.916 --> 02:57:44.020
AND THEN THAT THAT -- CREATES A

02:57:44.086 --> 02:57:45.755
DESPERATION THAT THAT FEEDS INTO

02:57:45.821 --> 02:57:46.255
THE VANS WE HAVE IN OUR

02:57:46.322 --> 02:57:48.290
COMMUNITIES -- AND IF WE LOOKED

02:57:48.357 --> 02:57:50.159
AT VIOLENCE ACROSS THE SECTOR

02:57:50.226 --> 02:57:50.926
MORE WHITE PEOPLE KILL WHITE

02:57:50.993 --> 02:57:52.762
PEOPLE MORE ASIAN PEOPLE KILL

02:57:52.828 --> 02:57:54.163
ASIAN PEOPLE BUT YOU NEVER HEAR

02:57:54.230 --> 02:57:56.332
THE TERM WHITE ON WHITE VIOLENCE --

02:57:56.399 --> 02:57:58.567
SO I THINK THAT REALLY AGAIN --

02:57:58.634 --> 02:57:59.769
APPLIED THIS HEARING.

02:57:59.835 --> 02:58:01.270
AND HOPE IT COMES WITH -- REAL

02:58:01.337 --> 02:58:03.105
LEGISLATION TO FOLLOW AND

02:58:03.172 --> 02:58:08.611
APPRECIATE YOUR COURAGE AND IN

02:58:08.677 --> 02:58:10.112
HAVING.

02:58:10.179 --> 02:58:11.013
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:12.314
FIRST OF ALL -- LET'S GIVE

02:58:12.381 --> 02:58:14.183
EVERYONE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR

02:58:14.250 --> 02:58:18.387
ONE BEING HERE AFTER SEPARATING.

02:58:18.454 --> 02:58:19.989
LET ME JUST SAY THIS THAT -- I

02:58:20.056 --> 02:58:20.890
RECEIVE YOU KNOW A LOT OF

02:58:20.956 --> 02:58:23.059
INFORMATION I APPRECIATE THE

02:58:23.125 --> 02:58:25.194
VERY ROBUST CONVERSATION I DON'T

02:58:25.261 --> 02:58:27.763
WANT THIS JUST TO BE A A ONE

02:58:27.830 --> 02:58:29.899
NIGHT WONDER KIND OF SELECT

02:58:29.965 --> 02:58:31.033
COMMITTEE I WANTED TO BE IN.

02:58:31.100 --> 02:58:33.169
A SELECT COMMITTEE -- THAT IS

02:58:33.235 --> 02:58:35.271
ACTIVE BUT IS PRO ACTIVE IN

02:58:35.337 --> 02:58:36.939
TERMS OF TRYING TO CREATE REAL

02:58:37.006 --> 02:58:39.608
SOLUTIONS SO THAT -- ONE THAT WE

02:58:39.675 --> 02:58:41.844
CAN BRING A WHITE PAPER -- THAT

02:58:41.911 --> 02:58:43.612
MAKES SENSE THAT A SIGNIFICANT

02:58:43.679 --> 02:58:44.780
TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEM TO

02:58:44.847 --> 02:58:46.282
PONDER OVER AND HOPEFULLY

02:58:46.348 --> 02:58:49.752
IMPLEMENT POLICIES -- ACT AS A

02:58:49.819 --> 02:58:51.220
WAY IN A VOICE TO CREATE
