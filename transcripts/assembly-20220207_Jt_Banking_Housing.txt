THE GOAL OF THIS HEARING IS TO HEAR FROM EXPERTS AND PRACTITIONERS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES HOMEOWNERS FACE WHEN BUILDING AN EIGHTY YOU IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN STREAMLINING AND PROMOTING THE USE OF ANY USE WHICH IS ACTUALLY A KEY TOOL TO BOOST HOUSING SUPPLY PROMOTE DENSITY AND IMPROVE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY BUT I REPEATEDLY FROM ADVOCATES AND ALSO FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT FINANCING REMAINS A KEY STICKING POINT. WE'VE REMOVED A LOT OF BARRIERS FOR HOMEOWNERS BUT ONE KEY STILL REMAINS HOW DO THEY PAY FOR IT BUILDING AN EIGHTY YOU IS EXPENSIVE IT OFTEN COST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SO WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS AND WHAT KIND OF OPTIONS DO HOMEOWNERS HAVE IF THEY DO NOT HAVE MUCH EQUITY OR IF THEY ARE LOWER IN INCOME. AND WHAT WHAT DO LENDERS ARE WHAT CAN LEADERS DO THAT THEY ARE DOING AND WHAT CAN THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO TO HELP THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE WILL EXPLORE TODAY AND HOPEFULLY TODAY'S HEARING WILL HELP GUIDE US TO SOME SOLUTIONS TOWARD SOLUTIONS. TO HELP OWNERS ACT- ACCESS SAFE AND AFFORDABLE FINANCING OPTIONS.

I DO WANT TO HAND IT OFF TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WICKS HOUSING- SIMPLY HOUSING CHAIR FOR OPENING COMMENTS AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR SAFE. THANK YOU FIRST I WANT TO THANK OUR BANKING CHAIR- MY FRIEND IS A MEMBER TIM GRAYSON- AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP IN ORGANIZING TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON EIGHTY FINANCING AND HIS COMMITMENT TO. REALLY BEING PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE AND I THINK THE IDEA OF BANKING COMMITTEE HOUSING COMMITTEE WORKING TOGETHER TO THINK THROUGH HOW WE CAN. PROVIDE CREATIVE IDEAS FOR FINANCING FOR EIGHTY YEARS AND OTHER THINGS IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE SOLUTION. AS SHARED HOUSING COMMITTEE ENCOURAGED ENCOURAGED BY THE RECENT GROWTH THAT WE'VE SEEN IN EIGHTY YOU CONSTRUCTION ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP ON EIGHTY YEARS IS GETTING NATIONAL ATTENTION TO. AND WAS HIGHLIGHTED LAST WEEK AT THE WHITE HOUSE EVENT ON MAKING IT EASIER TO BUILD EIGHTY USED. THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE'S EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE AND EXPEDITE THE LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IT'S NOW EASIER FOR HOMEOWNERS TO BUILD EIGHTY USE. AND JD IS. AND WE'VE SEEN A DRAMATIC RISE IN THE NUMBER OF EIGHTY USED IN CONSTRUCTING EACH YEAR. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY FOURTEEN LESS THAN EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY YEARS WERE PERMITTED ANNUALLY ACROSS THE STATE AND THEY MADE UP ABOUT. 1% OF OUR NEW HOUSING SIX YEARS LATER IN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHTY YOU PRODUCTION SAW. A MORE THAN TEN FOLD INCREASE WITH OVER TWELVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NEW ADS REPRESENTING ELEVEN POINT SIX. PERCENT OF ALL THE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION FOR THAT YEAR. AND WHILE THAT INCREASES GREAT WE STILL NEED TO BUILD A LOT MORE OF THEM. AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL HOUSING- BUT FINANCING THESE EIGHTY YEARS IS THE QUESTION WE WILL TACKLE TODAY. ARE STILL TOO MANY HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT TO BUILD AN EIGHTY LACKED THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO BUILD ONE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR SENIORS LOWER INCOME HOMEOWNERS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO RECENTLY PURCHASED THEIR HOMES AND HAVEN'T YET HAD THE TIME. TO BUILD UP THE EQUITY. WE KNOW THAT EIGHTY YEARS CAN BE AND WILL BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR ADDRESSING THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS IN TODAY'S CONVERSATION. IT'S JUST A STARTING POINT FOR THE ONGOING EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND THE FINANCING LANDSCAPE FOR HOMEOWNERS. SEEKING TO BUILD EIGHTY YEARS. TODAY WE HAVE THREE PANELISTS PRESENTING AND WE'LL HEAR FIRST FROM KORAN CALLED FROM THE URBAN INSTITUTE. I'M HERE I'M TRYING TO JUST SHARE MY- MY SCHOOL THERE WE GO SECOND GRADE WE CAN HEAR YOU WE SEE OF. AND EVERYONE SEE MY SCREEN. YEAH WE CAN WE CAN SEE YOUR SCREEN. OKAY TANK YOU THANKS A LOT THANKS COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND OUR THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. ON VARIOUS TO EIGHTY WITH FINANCING MINUS GROUNDHOG I'M A PRINCIPAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE WITH THE HOUSING FINANCE POLICY CENTER AT THE URBAN INSTITUTE OF MAKEUP WOULD NOW IS A NONPARTISAN RESEARCH THINK TANK BASED IN WASHINGTON DC. BEFORE I BEGAN I MUST STATE MY STANDARD DISCLAIMER RICHES THAT EVEN ABOUT EXPRESS IT TODAY ON MY VIEWS AND MY OWN AND NOT NECESSARILY THOSE ARE- A BIT INSECURE PARTS TRUSTEES ARE FUNDERS. SO LET ME START WITH A QUICK. BACKGROUND ON EACH. AS YOU ALL KNOW IT'S GLOWING UNIT ALREADY LOSE OUR SENSE THESE. SECOND COUNTING YOUR ON THE LINE AND A SINGLE HOME- CAN IF. YOUR HOUSE BACK CARNEGIE IN LAST WEEK FROM. AND YOU ALSO NOTICE MOST FAMILY DOES ZONE IN THE LAST PROHIBITED EIGHTY CONSTRUCTION BUT TODAY AS WE AS JUST MY- MANY STATES AND STATE MANY CITIES THAT STATES ARE INCREASINGLY PERMITTING THE USE OF UNITS ARE TO BE BET ON SINGLE FAMILY LOTS TO EASE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY. UNCOMFORTABLE HOUSING SITUATION AROUND THE COUNTRY. DESPITE THIS CHANGE IS POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE FINE AS AS WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER MAJOR HURDLE TO BE OVERCOME THAT COMES JACK INSTRUCTING IT TO USE AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH FINANCING OF THREE IT JUST DOESN'T IS AN EFFICIENT MECHANISM. NATIONWIDE DEALS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF EIGHTY YEARS. AT ADAM AT MASSIVE SCALE. SO GET INTO THE OF THE- I'M GOING TO BE ANSWERING FOR. DIFFERENT BUT- RELATED QUESTIONS FIRST WOULD TALK ABOUT- WHAT YOU FINANCING OPTIONS ARE TYPICALLY AVAILABLE FOR MOST HOMEOWNERS TODAY. ARE WHY DID YOU FINANCE IT IS SO DIFFICULT. AND WE TALKED. BRIEFLY ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY AND RENOVATION FINANCING ON THAT ORDER HAS PLACED AND THIS SEGMENT AND IN THE RECENT PAST. FINALLY I'LL CLOSE IT OUT WITH A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW. TO IMPROVE IF YOU FINANCE. FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OPTIONS THAT MOST HOMEOWNERS- CONSTRUCTING A- I WANTED TO QUICKLY CONSTRUCT EIGHTY WAS AND IF YOU RAISE. ONE WHICH SEEMS TO BE BY FAR THE MOST COMMON IS TO USE A UNIT WITH THE HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS AND CASH. ORDER CAPE COD OTHER HIGH INTEREST DEBTS SUCH AS PERSONAL LOANS AND EVEN HARD CREDIT CARDS ARE BEING USED AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE REALLY SHORT TERM LOAN OPTIONS. TYPICALLY NO MORE THAN A YEAR OR SO. THE SECOND- WE FINANCING PARTY USE IS TO. HOME EQUITY AND ARE THREE WELL KNOWN PRODUCTS ON MY COMPUTER. WHICH IS BASICALLY ECHOES AND SEX PRODUCT HOME EQUITY LINE OF. AND A CASH OUT REFINANCE. AND THEN THE THIRD PREDOMINANT EIGHTY YOU ARE EIGHTY FINANCING RATE IS TO ACT WHAT IS KNOWN AS A RENOVATION. AND THAT TO MAIN BUCKETS OF RENOVATION FINANCING THAT AVAIL AGENCIES SUCH AS FANNIE MAE FREDDIE MAC FHA AND VA- AND THEY PROVIDED THAT YOU KNOW THEY WORK WITH LENDERS TO FINANCE OUR RENOVATION FINANCING AND THEN YOU HAVE NON FEDERAL FINANCING AVAILABLE FROM. PRIVATELY HELD BANKS THREE GENES. AND STATE HOUSING FINANCE BEGINS. THE ISSUE IS. ALL OF THE PROGRAMS ARE EITHER IN SCOPE OR HAVE OTHER ACTS THAT MAKE EXTREME DIFFICULT TO USE THEM AT. IT'S LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT DETAILS. CUSTOMERS HOME LENDING AND THIS INCLUDES GENERALLY SPEAKING HOME EQUITY LOANS HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT AS WELL AS CASH OUT YEAH. THE ISSUE HERE FAR ESPECIALLY FOR A HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT IS THAT THE UNDERWRITING REQUIREMENTS ARE EXTREMELY STRINGENT THAT IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND FIND THAT AVERAGE. MICHAEL SCORE THAT IS NEEDED TO QUALIFY FOR A HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT AS WELL IN EXCESS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE HIGH ENOUGH INCOME TO QUALIFY FOR SUCH A LONG. SECOND HOME EQUITY LENDING WHETHER IT'S CASH OUT REFINANCE YOUR LOCKS OR HOME EQUITY. LOANS ARE USUALLY CAPPED AT 80% OF THE CURRENT MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. AMINO ACIDS GET OUT AGAIN R. AS PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN THEIR HOMES. THEY'RE ALSO GETTING MORE AND MORE PRIMARY MORTGAGE DEBT IN FACT FOR MANY SENIORS DOWN. THE FRONT THE VOLUME UP THE PRIMARY MORTGAGE DEBT THAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO RETIREMENT HAS ON THE GROUND. SO THIS 80% CAP ON ON. ON ON THE FOLLOWING. ACTUALLY IT'S A HUGE BARRIER FOR MANY OF THOSE FOLKS. AND THEN THE THIRD MAJOR ISSUE WITH HOME EQUITY LENDING IS THAT IT SIMPLY DOES NOT CONSIDER THE INCOME. THE EIGHTY YOU ARE WILL LIKELY GENERATE AND UP IN THE FUTURE SO IT SEEMS PERFECTLY LOGICAL TO ME YOU ACT- YOU'LL SHOULD GET SOME CREDIT. HE'S PARTIAL CREDIT FOR THE RENTAL INCOME BUT YOU WOULD GENERATE IN THE FUTURE. SO THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE OF THE HOME EQUITY LENDING. AND THEN AS FAR AS THE APPRAISAL IS CONCERNED WE HAVE ANOTHER BIG ISSUE THERE WHICH IS- THE BACK HOME EQUITY LENDING IS SIMPLY NOT OPTIMIZED FOR. FINANCING. USE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONSIDER. THAT IS THE LOAN THAT YOU CAN GET IS BASED ON PROPERTY VALUE AT THE TIME OF THE APP WITH. NOT GONNA LET YOU OFF THE- ONE THE EIGHTEENTH AND IS COMPLETE MAJOR SEEMS VERY BACKWARDS TO MAKE. ABOUT GENGHIS ARE SOME WITH OUR- FOR MOSTLY A WOULD BE WORTH SECOND. IS GO ON THE SOME ISSUES NEED TO BE WORKED OUT THERE. AGAIN ANOTHER HUGE. THAT LET ME HOW MUCH MONEY ARE CAN I BORROW TO FINANCE YOU CAN SEE. LONG AND SHORT ON OF ALL THE THIS IS. THAT CORRECT AND IN I A PRODUCT OF FINANCE ET INCOME WELL MIDDLE IN FOLKS- ONLY WORKS BY FOR THE PROPER OWNERS. LOTS OF YOU CAN GET HOME THAT'S THE STAND OF SAVE. AND HIGH ENOUGH INCOMES TO QUALIFY FOR THIS TYPE OF MY. FOR THE REST. OF THE WHO WON TO GET AN EIGHTY BED THEY- TO GET ON. A KIND OF A RANDOM I AM. BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY. TYPE OF. OUT THERE. THAT TAKES ACCOUNT THE POST CONSTRUCTION- WE CALL THE AFTER REPAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. INTO CONSIDERATION. AND WHAT COMES TO RENOVATION FINANCING THERE IS PRODUCTS AVAILABLE- YOU KNOW TO FHA THEY HAVE TO DO PROGRAMS THAT LIMIT FOR MANY STANDARD FORM AND THEN THERE. ARE PRODUCTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC LET'S TALK ABOUT IT FIRST THAT'S WHAT YOU GET PROGRAM AS A RESPONSE- IT HAS A LIMITED FORM WHICH ARE UNDER WHICH THE MAXIMUM LOAN AMOUNT THAT CAN BE BARKLEY'S THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND STUPID HE WAS FROM MINOR REMODELING AND CONSTRUCTION. YES IT'S OBVIOUSLY. DOES NOT WORK. MUCH FOR HER EVEN. AND THEN THERE IS A SIGN FORM THE AVERAGE FINANCING. WHICH I YOU TO BORROW MUCH THAN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND BUT IT HAS SOME SERIOUS BETTER JUST THAT LET COM. FIRST LETTER THATWANTS TO PROVIDE THE FINANCE. AS TO GONE CONVENTIONAL X. THAT. AND THE LENDER TO GROUP PROJECT PLAN. AGAINST PLAN COSTS ESTIMATE DONE AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES ALONG WITH CONSTRUCTION PROJECT ON TOP OF THAT THE LETTER HAS TO INSURE- THAT THE QUALITY OF THE FINAL PRODUCT IS IN LINE WITH WHAT THE ETHICS EXPECTS. ALL OF THIS WHAT IT DOES IS IT ADDS YES THE SUBSTANTIAL COST THE LENDER FOR MAKING EIGHTY ALONE BUT ALSO EXPOSES THEM TO A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND RISK HEY GUYS IF GET OUT IF. THE JOB IS NOT DONE TO THE SATISFACTION OF OXYGEN REQUIREMENTS AND THE LENDERS. SO IN MY LENDERS SIMPLY ARE YOU KNOW THE FACT WANTED IT TURNS LAND SCHOOL A BONA THAT'S ON THERE. AND MANAGEMENT LET US. I HAVE NO ABILITY TO DO THAT ONE SKILLS AND NO WAY FOR THEM TO BUILD THIS THAT. UP COST MOST OF THE THEY ESTABLISH FROM THE PROGRAM WHICH MIGHT. AND THEN THERE ARE THE- BUT THIS TO THE ATHLETIC. SUCH AS THE REPAIRS START WITH AN DAYS CLOSING. I MUST BE. IN SIX MONTHS IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND THERE'S A PROCESS FOR THAT THAT THE LENDER HAS TO FOLLOW- THE BORROWER MUST IN ADDITION FIRE RESTAURANT CONSULTANT OVERSEE THE RENOVATION PROCESS YEAH ORDINATING. WITH A HARD CONSENT AND PUT IT IN THAT THE LENDER OUR WATER MIGHT HAVE BETTER RELATED DELAYS ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW INTRODUCES SO MANY ARRESTS INSTRUCTION FOR THE PROCESS. IN FACT MOST LENDERS ARE SIMPLY DON'T WANT. TO- THE END THIS. IN ANY MEANINGFUL. FINALLY THE CORNER PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT MUST BE SET ASIDE AS A- AND JUST AS A AND YOU KNOW AND THE DATA. I WANTED TO OUT THEIR- TOOK CONTRAST THE FHA WILL TO LIMIT FORM- LIMIT DOCTOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS MEDIAN OF WHICH IS THEM OUT TWENTY TWO. AND THIS IS NOT A USER QUITE A SUGGESTS AND YOUR RUN AWAY. I WAS ABOUT SEVENTY. THOUSAND THE. AND EIGHTY WHAT ARE THE- COST MORE THAN THE- IN THIS TIME OF- GENERALLY. RENOVATION LOAN THE IS AVAILABLE SEVEN TO MAE THEY CALL IT THE HOME ROAD AND THAT FREDDIE MAC THEY CALL IT THE CHOICE NOW PRODUCT PRODUCT- THESE PROGRAMS ARE SLIGHT MORE- IN THE BEYOND SLIGHTLY MORE RELAXED WITH. A I DOES INSTANCE YOU HAVE CALLED US TO COME THE- STILL TO SET US AND THE GST THANK AND FREDDIE. I DO NOT REQUIRE- WHAT ARE OUTSIDE A CONSULTANT WHICH IS THE- BUT HIS ONE OF THE- THAT LET THIS- DATACORE THE GST THAT'S- OUR TRANSPORT ALL THE RISKS RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION DELAYS AND WORKMANSHIP ON THE LAND THAT IS. BEST TO THE LANDER AT THE TIME OF THE MAKING AT THAT TIME THE LONGER MAKES THIS LOAN THE LENDER IS EFFECTIVELY AGREEING TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR ANY DELAYS COST OVERRUNS FOR QUALITY WORKMANSHIP SECTOR. AND AGAIN. IT BRINGS US TO THE SAME ISSUE WITH FHA WHICH IS THAT MOST LENDERS ARE SIMPLY NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS RISK BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY FOR THEM TO MANAGE THE STRESS AND SO AGAIN. DATE. STAMP OUT FROM THE PROGRAM. I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT IN OF TWENTY THIRTY NINE DAY. AT A SORT A LIMIT- I TRIED A NEW GENERATION LONG FROM. WHICH DOES NOT. WHICH LENDERS OF THESE BUT IT'S A LIMIT PROGRAM YEAH THE AMOUNT THAT THE BAR CAN BORROW. THIS LIKE THAT- FIFTEEN FOR OF THE VOTE OF THE PROPERTY BUT IT'S STILL AN INCH FROM. WHERE WE USED. AND SO YOU'RE LEFT WITH A RENOVATION- LANDS. BETTER DENIAL EXCITED HIGH. WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS CHART IS THE MORTGAGE DENIAL RATES FOR RENOVATION LOANS. THAT WERE MADE. IN SOME TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY. AND YOU CAN SEE I. THE MEN HOME AT LOANS TEND TO- KNOW PRIMARILY ACROSS FOR- INFO. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS CHART BY THAT SHOWS UP PER AND I RATE FOR- HOME EQUITY. DURING THIS PERIOD. FOLLOW BY THAT LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT OF NOW I JUST WITH 35% AGAIN TWO PRODUCTS HOME YOU. ARE THAT. HIGHEST RATES AMONG OUR- LOAN PRODUCTS THERE. SO JUST TO SUMMARIZE THE KEY AT THE VERY IF YOU- SINGLE BARRIER IS THE FACT THAT FEDERAL. BUT IT'S A- THANK YOU MA'AM FREDDIE MAC ONE LENDERS COSTS. DON'T HAVE ANY WAY TO MITIGATE THE REST OFTEN DELAYS AND COST OVERRUNS BUT EVEN THE RESPECT PROJECT MIGHT NEVER BE- COMPLETE IT- THE SECOND BARRIER IS THAT MOST OF THESE LENDING PROGRAMS DO NOT CONSIDER THAT RENTAL INCOME THE EIGHTY YOU WILL GENERATE AND EVEN THE RENOVATION PROGRAMS OUT THERE. TODAY I DO NOT- INCIDENTAL INCOME. AGAIN THIS IS THIS ISSUE FOR LOW INCOME- AND SENIOR SWIMMER TO CONSIDER AND USE BUT JUST DON'T HAVE COMES ARE HIGH IN. ON AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ISSUE AROUND THE LENDING CAP WHICH IS SET AT EIGHTY PERCENT- THE APPRAISAL ISSUE AND THEY DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AFTER REPAIR VALUE OFF THE- INTO ACCOUNT. AFTER REPAIR VALUE OF THE HOME AND FOUND. AND THEN AS NOW A- H. I THINK THAT DOES GET I MEANT ALARM. IS THAT. EIGHTY LOANS ARE RENOVATION LOANS IN GENERAL ARE SMALLER IN SIZE THAN MENTIONED EARLIER. THE AVERAGE VENTILATION LOAN IN TWENTY TWENTY WHAT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR LENDERS LOOKING AT THAT COLOGNE AND COMPARING IT TO A HOME PURCHASE LOAN THAT COULD EASILY BE YOU KNOW 400-500-6000 DOLLARS. A LENDER HAS EVERY INCENTIVE TO MAKE. A LOAN TO A BAR WENT BACK ONCE YOU GET A BIGGER LOAN BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THAT DOES GET COMPENSATED THE LAUNCH OF THE LOAN AMOUNT. I HAD THAT COMPENSATION ITSELF I THINK THERE'S ALSO A SMALL LOAN. AT ASPECT TO THE RENOVATION FINANCING. ISSUE BECAUSE IT JUST MEANS- LET US DO NOT HAVE THE SAME INCENTIVE TO MAKE A RENOVATION LOAN. AS THAT WOULD HAPPEN YOU KNOW FIVE. IS THAT LIKE A MEDICARE. LOAN OR HOME PURCHASE OR OR. IT MIGHT SEEM THAT WITH ALL THESE ISSUES GOING WITH FEDERAL FINE. AND ALL THESE HURDLES. THAT WE SHOULD SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD THINK OF WHAT PRIVATE MARKETS. YOU MIGHT LOOK AT OR YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GOOD THE STATE LEVEL. BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM. THIS CHART SHOWS YOU. ARE AGAIN FOR THE THREE YEAR PERIOD FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. A TOTAL OF FIFTY BILLION AND RENOVATION LENDING- WAS ORIGINATED DURING THIS PERIOD. AND FORTY FIVE OUT OF THAT FIFTY BILLION 90% UP BACK WHAT'S FEDERALLY BACKED- THROUGH FANNIE MAE FREDDIE MAC FHA AND BE. ONLY FIVE. BILLION WISE NON FEDERALLY BACKED THE REASON I. SHOW THE SLIGHTEST DIGEST. OUR DRIVES. HOME THE POINT THAT. YEAH IS THE ARTIST. RENOVATIONS THE ARTIST. EIGHTY FINANCE ISSUE. JUST BECAUSE OF THIS SCALE OF THE FIVE DOT GOVERNMENT SPACE THE SOLUTION TO THE EIGHTY FINANCE PROBLEM HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE- FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE. INFRASTRUCTURE JUST BECAUSE OF THE SCALE AND A HALF THAT THE FEDERAL AGENCIES. BACK TO THE SPACE. AND I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE- YOU KNOW ONE SLIDE ON HOLD PRESERVATION THIS IS NOT STRICTLY YOU USE BUT WHAT THIS IT WAS SHOWS. IS THAT DISTRIBUTION ARE THE NATIONWIDE HOUSING STOCK UP ABOUT FORTY MILLION BASED ON THE YEAR YOUR PET AND CAN SEE HERE IS. THAT ABOUT 12% OFF OUR HOUSING STOCK NATIONALLY WAS BETTER- IN THE YEAR NINETEEN THIRTY NINE OR- FORTY AND NINETEEN. FIFTY NINE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND THE VERY LAST CALL AND YOU CAN SEE THE CUMULATIVE SHARE FOCUS ON THAT THIRD ROW FROM THE TOP- YOU CAN SEE THAT. ABOUT 50% OF. THE NASH NATION'S HOUSING STOCK. OR JUST OVER HALF OF IT WAS- IS MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OLD. A QUARTER OF NATIONAL STOCK IS MORE THAN. YEARS OLD NOW WHY DO I BRING THIS UP ON ANY- FINANCING HEARING. BECAUSE HOUSING. FINANCING IS ALSO FINANCE YOU CAN. IT USING RENOVATION FINANCING WHICH WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOT WORKING AS OPTIMALLY AS IT SHOULD BE. SO THE POINT IS IF HE CAN FIX RENOVATION FINANCING B. YOU WILL NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE PROSPECTIVE EIGHTEEN FINANCING. BUT WILL ALSO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOLKS TO PRESERVE HOUSING BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. HOUSING UNIT THAT IS KEPT FROM GOING OBSOLETE IN THE HOUSING UNIT THAT'S BASICALLY ADDED BACK TO THE HOUSE AND STACK AND WE DESPERATELY NEED THAT IN THIS- IRAQ. YOU KNOW RAPIDLY ESCALATING HOUSE PRICES. AND RENTS ACROSS THE NATION. SO ASK SLIDE JUST ARE YOU BUT THE THING WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ANIMATION FINANCING. ARE FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK WE HAVE TO ABSOLUTELY OVERCOME. THAT RISK THAT THAT WINDOW STAYS THAT IS THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE NO EASY WAY OF MITIGATING RISK. CONSTRUCTION AND SO THEY NEED SOME ASSURANCE THAT CONSTRUCTION WOULD BE COMPLETED ON TIME AND WITHIN BUDGET IN THIS CABINET MEETING AND A COUPLE OF MINUTES I THINK. NOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT REMEMBER BACK IN TWENTY. FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CITY OF DETROIT BUT IT WAS- YOU KNOW FACING THAT COLLECT OFF- ABANDONED HOMES- THAT HAD FALLEN INTO DISREPAIR- THAT JUST ALL THAT FROM. WHAT THEY DID IS THAT THE SAME. TEAMED UP WITH DEPOT TO THE BATH HOUSE IN SOUTH ABANDONED HOMES. AND A MASSIVE MASSIVE SCALE AND SO THEY MANAGED VANTAGE OF THIS APPROACH BUT AT HOME PEOPLE WAS ABLE TO HIRE CONTRACTORS FROM ITS EXISTING APPROVED VENDOR LIST. AND SO THAT MADE SURE THAT GAVE THE CITY OF DETROIT CONFIDENCE THAT THE WORK WOULD BE DONE IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER. AND THE CONTRACTORS THAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT ON THIS LIST ARE SUBJECT TO QUALITY STANDARDS BACKGROUND CHECKS AND A LOT OF OTHER READING. BRAIN SURE A CERTAIN. MINIMUM LEVEL OF QUALITY. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT. THE BEST LIST. LOGIC THE- LABOUR BACK IT'S THE PAINT WAS MATTER .COM ACCOUNTS WITH. CARPET STAND SO COULD. HI YOU TO BRING THESE NICKI YEAH AND YOU KNOW AT MY BY THE THAT YOU HAVE AND BUGS AND THEN. TRY THE LABOR MANNER AND BENEFIT FROM THE LARGE ECONOMY OF SCALE. THE FOR THIS MODEL MUST ADVISE OPTED OUT SHOPPING. BUT A DATE. BEYOND A REASONABLE. THAT THE MOUNTAIN CAN ABSOLUTELY WORK. SO THAT'S ONE APPROACH THAT- ONE CAN THINK OFF SOMETHING THAT'S MARKET AROUND THAT- ARE THEN THERE IS ANOTHER YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO THROW OUT THERE. AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH- ACTIVITY. EIGHTY UNITS- WHAT THE THINGS THE STATE COULD DO AS SORT OF MY TO SEE DAY AND SEND TO HELP. THAT CAN START ACTUALLY BUT USE. AN ADVANTAGE OBVIOUSLY IS THE IF YOU ARE THIS YEAR THAT IS. BE ASSEMBLED OR PARTIALLY IN A FACTORY THEN YOU ARE TAKING OUT OF THE QUESTION A LOT THE CONSTRUCTION. DRESS THAT LINGERS ON THE HOPE FOR TODAY YOU ALSO HAVE A STANDARD PRODUCT AGAIN IT'LL CUT CODE SO. WELL THAT IS NOT AN ISSUE. AND SO IN IN A MOMENT SOUNDS A LOT OF PROBLEMS- THAT ONE SEES WITH THE SITE. USING GOOGLE ACCORDING SOME SORT OF A TAX INCENTIVE FOR HOMEOWNERS THAT DO THIS BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER. FOR LENDERS TO PROVIDE FINANCING. AND THEN YOU COULD ALSO LOOK AT. CENTRES FOR HOMO THAT EIGHTY YOU. THE SECTION EIGHT HOLDERS AND THAT MAN THAT SHE HAD A IT'S YOU WANT TO MOVE WORLD THERE. WE WANT TO. DENTAL AND TO BE CORPORATE INTO UNDER. SECTION EIGHT MIGHT GIVE LAND SOME SUCH RISK OF THAT AND- NOT. HANK YOU IMPROVEMENTS TO LAND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER- YOU UNDERWRITING IN MY- PROVIDER MEANS THAT THE PERSON CREDIT FOR FUTURE RENTAL INCOME. BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS NOT- THIS IS NOT A NICE TO HAVE THIS IS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE ABSOLUTELY NEED. IF WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE MORE LOWER INCOME HOMEOWNERS AND SENIOR HOMEOWNERS ARE LIVING ON FIXED INCOMES TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THIS TYPE OF FINANCING. YOU HAVE TO FIX THAT PRETZELS. AND I'D GET TO A WORLD WHERE WE'RE DOING APPRAISALS ON AFTER THE PAIR BASES. TODAY THIS IS DIFFICULT IN OUR BECAUSE OF LACK OF COUNTS BUT OVER TIME. AS MORE AND MORE EASE GET. AND THEN YOU HAVE AND ACCOUNTS OF THEIR OPEN A NEW. THEY SHARED BE A PROBLEM THE MESSED WITH- CITY AGAIN TODAY IS THAT MAJOR FERRY AMONG. LIMITS AMOUNT OF MY THEY CAN- WE HAVE TO RAISE THAT ON MAXIMUM LOAN TO BUY AFTER EIGHTY. EIGHTY PER OF HIGHER NUMBER NINETY MAYBE 95% AND YOU CAN. CONSIDER OF MOTIVATE DO WITH THIS SPECIFICALLY. AS LONG AS THE FUNDS ARE USED TO FINANCE EIGHTY WAS BECAUSE AGAIN 80% CAP WAS LARGELY PUT IN PLACE AFTER THE LAST RECESSION TO. PREVENT HOMEOWNERS FROM GETTING OVER LEVERAGED AND SO WHAT IS WHAT THE CAP YOU COULD THINK OF WERE FUNDS ARE USED TO FINANCE IT USED. AND THEN THE FINAL THING ON THE SECOND THING- IS JUST A LITTLE- YOU KNOW CORPORATE OBJECTIVES. FOR A- REAL- YOU KNOW EIGHTY YOU'LL FIND A APPROACH. AND YOU KNOW AGAIN YOU GOT RIGHT NOW THAT IS THAT HE- PUSH. IN THE INDUSTRY AMONG THE REGULATORS IN WASHINGTON DC ON INCORPORATING MORE NONTRADITIONAL- DATA- MORTGAGE APPLICANTS AND THIS INCLUDES YOU KNOW SOMEONE'S RENT PAYMENT HISTORY. INCLUDES EAGLES HAITIAN PAY PAYING THAT TELECOM BILLS THAT BANK CASH. ALTHOUGH NOT STILL THERE SEVEN DAYS EARLY STAGES OF THIS. LONGER TERM I THINK THERE'S NO REASON YOU COULD INCORPORATE SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE APPROVED HOMEOWNERS. OR EVEN FINANCING AS WELL. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO MAY JUST GO MAYBE APPROACH- MAYBE DISAPPROVE OR FINANCE TODAY AT THE MARKET. AND THE LAST SECOND YOU'RE ON IT YOU'RE IS. I GUESS I MENTIONED EARLIER A LOT OF HOMEOWNERS USE THEIR CASH AND SAVINGS AND OTHER HIGH INTEREST DEBTS PERSONAL LOANS ARE. CONSTRUCT EIGHTY WE I THINK WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE A WAY FO THESE HOMEOWNERS TO REFINANCE THESE PRODUCTS AND PAY OUT THESE HAD INTEREST. IN SUSTAINABLE- BUT THAT- BY THE FINANCE M. TRADITIONAL REACH NANCY. PRODUCT THAT'S AVAILABLE IF IT'S WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES OR EVEN FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR. SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY AND WILL TURN IT BACK OVER HERE. THANK YOU SO VERY VERY MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION CON AND WE ARE NOW GOING TO GO TO OUR NEXT PANELIST. FRANCESC MARTI WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SHARES GRACE AND HELLO PANELISTS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. MY NAME IS FRIENDS ASK MARTY AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATION AND POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY KNOWN AS COLLEGE AFFAIR. I AM JOINED TODAY BY HELLO MARTIN OUR DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND STAKEHOLDER RELATIONS AND ALSO BY. CHERYL SILVA WHO IS THE PROJECT LEAD FOR NEAL EIGHTY YOU GRANT PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC OF- FINANCING EXCESS REDOING UNITS ALREADY USED ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WE LAUNCH OUR NEW EIGHTY YOU GRANT PROGRAM. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. HFA IS THIS OR OF THE HOUSE LENDER WITH US QUITE RATING AND THIS THING GOVERNANCE. WE ARE. A MULTI THOUGHT LOANS- AND ALSO THIS TIME THE LARGEST RELY OF DOWN US FOR FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS COMBINATION OF EXPERIENCE IN HOME OWNERSHIP AND DEVELOPMENT FINANCE MEANS THAT COLLECTOR FACE PARTICULARLY WELL POSITIONED. TO STAR IN THE STATES. FIRST DIRECT I NEED YOU PROVIDE YOU- WITH TOUCH BASE PERSPECTIVE ON THE EIGHTY YOU. FINANCE LANDSCAPE FOLLOWED BY AN UPDATE ON WHERE OUR PROGRAM A NEW PROGRAM IS AND WHERE IT IS GOING NEXT. IN ANALYZING THE EIGHTY YEAR HIGH ESCAPE AS WE WERE DESIGNING THE PROGRAM. FOR MADE BARRIERS TODAY AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF OVERLAP WITH ONE MY- FELLOW PANELISTS JUST DESCRIBED. THE FIRST BATTERY IS THAT THE EIGHTY YEAR LET MARKET ISN'T A MERE AS A OF THIS FAMILY. LENDING NUMBERS THERE ARE FAR PARTICIPANTS I'M NINETY PRODUCTS IN THIS SPACE- KENNISON IN MY PREVIOUS FINALIST- ALLUDED TO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS FOR THIS- FOR INSTANCE SOME TRADITIONAL MORTGAGE LENDERS ARE RESISTANT TO TAKING ON. THE CONSTRUCTION MONITORING AND VERIFICATION PROCESS THAT IS OFTEN REQUIRED IN EIGHTY YOU CONSTRUCTION LOANS- ANOTHER IMPORTANT REASON IS THE LACK OF GOOD APPRAISALS APPARATUS DO NOT YET HAVE A RELIABLE AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY FOR VALUING. AT U. S. THEY CONTINUE TO RELY UPON. HARD TO FIND COMPARABLES. THE SECOND MAIN BARRIER THESE BORROWERS ACCESS TO IT YOU STICK THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE. FOR MIDDLE AND MODERATE INCOME BORROWERS HOLLAND FOR BORROWERS WITH LIMITED HOME EQUITY. BOOK AND NOT ACCESS A HOME EQUITY LOAN OR HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT. I WENT TO THIS CHALLENGE AND AS WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY AS WELL MOREOVER SKATING I USED EIGHTY YOU FUTURE RENTAL INCOME TO QUALIFY FOR A CONSTRUCTION WORKER- ALONE ANIMATION ALONG OR EVEN TO REFINANCE AFTERWARDS AND THAT IS FOR FANNIE. MAE AND FHA RULES. A THIRD BARRIER THE HYPE COSTS THE CALIFORNIA IT IS NUMBER FORTY CENTS TO SEE AN EIGHTY YOU COSTING UPWARDS OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUILD. IF THE HOMEOWNER INTENDS TO RENT A UNIT. RENTAL INCOME NEEDS TO BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. PROPERTY TAXES INSURANCE AND MAINTENANCE AT A MINIMUM AND WHILE CERTAIN AREAS CERTAINLY COMMAND RENTS THAT ARE SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY THESE HIGH CONSTRUCTION COSTS COSTS. HOMEOWNERS IN LOWER RENT AREAS MAY STRUGGLE TO JUSTIFY THE COST. OF AN- ACCIDENT. ON THE FOURTH OF RECENT. IS RISING INTEREST RATES ARE SEVERAL OTHER LENDERS AND WE WORK WITH AT COLLEGE OF FATE I EXPECT NEW HOME RENOVATION LOANS TO SLOW DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY AS INTEREST RATES ISE AND THIS IS BECAUSE THESE PRODUCTS REQUIRE. HOMEOWNERS TO REFINANCE OUT OF THEIR EXISTING HISTORICALLY LOW RATE FIRST MORTGAGE RIGHT. OFF. SO AS WE DISCUSSED. OUR NEW LOOK AT PROGRAM IT ISN'T FOR THE COMMITTEE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT SUSTAINABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP IS AT- SHUTTLE BELLER- IN HELLO COLLEGE IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THROUGH SOUND UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND I'M DOING ANOTHER GUARD RAILS. PARTICIPATING HOMEOWNERS HAVE THE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND THE SUPPORT. TO AVOID THAT EIGHTY PROTECTION ON. AND SO ALEX PLAYED ALL THESE ISSUES INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN DESIGNING OUR BROAD STRATEGY TO TACKLE. FINANCING ON OUR MULTI PRONGED APPROACH HAS TO BE MADE COMPONENTS THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THE FIRST PROBLEM IS STANDING UP THIS STATE EIGHTY YOU. RIGHT THIS SECOND HE'S EXPANDING THE BLOOD BANKERS AND THAT INCLUDES THE TALKING TO LOCALITY CDFI. AND OTHERS AND FINALLY THE THIRD PROBLEM IS PARTNERING WITH EIGHTY YOU MANUFACTURERS AND TO CONSUMERS. SO TO IS DOING WORK ON ALL THREE TRACKS SIMILAR TENUOUSLY AND WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT TIME IN CONSTRUCTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT HIS FIRST PROBLEM THAT PROGRAM THAT THE GRANT PROGRAM. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT LENDING CAPACITY. TO FULLY SCALED UP AROUND. THE FIRST PHASE IS BECOMING FULLY OPERATIONAL AS WE SPEAK HI WHICH WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD ROUNDS OF THE STRATEGY TO COME TO FRUITION LATER IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. HANDLE SOME TINY THREE. SO ARE ABOUT PROGRAM IS. TO BE A STRONG INCENTIVE BUT WITH AN IMPORTANT SOCIAL EQUITY FOCUSED HANNITY'S DELIVER. MILLION REQUEST SYSTEM SIMILAR TO COLLEGE A FACE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH IS A PROVEN. I'M SEASON METHOD ALSO SALEABLE FINANCING SO IN A NUTSHELL. OUR NEW PROGRAM DEPLOYED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TO PROVIDE HOMEOWNERS WITH. THE FIVE THOUSAND. DOLLARS TO HELP THEM BUILD AN EIGHTY AND IT IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE FOUR THOUSAND. EIGHT USE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. OUR SOCIAL MEDIA OBJECT OBJECTIVES ARE REFLECTED HOW WE DESIGN THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. TO PARTICIPATE A HOUSEHOLD HAS TO BE OVERCOME WHICH IS A IT'S A 100% THERE MIGHT. BE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME AND HAVE LESS THAN 20% IN HOME EQUITY. ALREADY LONG MODERATE INCOME QUALIFIED CENTER TRACK WHICH. ARE IS A CONCENTRATED POVERTY. THESE WERE THE REAL WHERE THEY WOULD ENSURE THAT WILL FOLK ON THOSE WHO CAN NOT SIMPLY GET. AS I'M BEFORE. INSURING THE LONG TERM ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS THESE PROJECTS IT IS AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY OF THAT PROGRAM. AND SO COLLEGE IF THEY WILL DEPLOY FINDS THE BEGINNING OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS TO HAVE. THE MOST IMPACT HOMEOWNERS WHILE ENSURING THAT THE EAGLES ARE BUILT SO PAIRING THESE RATS WITH WHEN A PATIENT FINANCING. IS KEY TO MAKING SURE THAT THE BORROWER IS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE LENDERS ARE ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK IS NOT. INITIALLY ARE ANY OF MASS- MAINLY DEPLOYED THROUGH CULTIVATE EXISTING LENDER NETWORK WHICH HAS A BROAD GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS HOW THE PARENTAL WORK A HOMEOWNER FIRST APPLIES FOR RENOVATION LOAN THROUGH ACKNOWLEDGES. WITH CENTER DOWN THE LEFT THEIR ROLES THREE DEVELOPMENT COST INDICATES PERMIT FEES DESIGN SITE PREP WORK INTO THE LONG AND THEN SEND THE APPLICATION OVER TOUCH A THING THE CARD TO PAY APPROVED WIRES THAT KATIE ROCK FUNDS DIRECTLY TO THE CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AND THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS THE VENDOR TO REDUCE. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT DUE ON THE- HI WITH ONE PAGE INFOGRAPHIC THAT DESCRIBES SCHOOL. A JOKE OUT OF IT HAS BEEN ALSO. MEETING WITH MAE TO A- JULIE DATA YOU FINANCE OPTIONS AND WAYS TO INCREASE. AWARENESS FOR CUTS PAGE IN YOUR PROGRAM AND ON THAT NOTE WE WERE REALLY PROUD TO ADD THAT OUR PARTNERSHIP AND CONSERVATION PROGRAM WAS RECENTLY. RECOGNIZED AT THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE CALL ON EIGHTY THIS WEEK. THE FIRST GRANT WE FUNDED- WITH THIS PROGRAM- ONCE COMBINED WITH A FANNIE MAE HOMESTYLE RENOVATION LOAN AND WE'RE USING THIS AS A CASE STUDY. TO SHOWCASE HOW OUR PROGRAM. AND FINALLY MAY WORK TOGETHER. SO IN THE LAST MONTHS COLLEGE IF THEY DATA BECAUSE YOU ITS PROGRAM HAS BEEN- IT THE LENDER ONBOARDING. WHICH IS CRITICAL IN BUILDING THE DELIVERY NETWORK FOR IT TO DELIVER THIS ASSISTANCE. WE NOW HAVE A CRITICAL MASS OF SIX FULLY ONBOARDED LANDERS AND INCLUDE BIG NAMES LIKE ALONE PEOPLE GUILD. AND HOME RICH AND THAT ALSO PROVIDES A REALLY ROBUST GEOGRAPHIC BRANCH COVERAGE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF AWARDING AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT LETTERS FOR A TOTAL OF UP TO FORTY PARTICIPATING LENDERS EXPECTED. IN THIS FIRST PHASE TRY THIS VERY MOMENT IN TIME WE'RE ALSO STARTING A FULL SCALE MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS PAID MICROTARGETINGDIGITALIZED SO CAN SOCIAL MEDIA AND SHARON COMPLICATION TOOL KITS WITH A RANGE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS. OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT. HOMER APPLICATION WILL START SCALING UP SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NEXT IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS. AS I EXPLAINED PREVIOUSLY COLLAGEN FACE STRANGULATED ROACH THAT ALSO SEEKS TO EXPAND THE LENDER. NETWORK AND BUILD PARTNERSHIPS LONG TERMS. OKAY ALREADY MEETING WITH ORIGINAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OAKLAND VENUS VEHICLE AND HOW DO YOU. IN THE- WILL PAY PHASE AND OUR INTEREST. INTERESTED IN. ARE YOU PRO ARRIVED WITH THEIR PROBLEMS. AND WE HAVE ALSO BEEN TALKING TO SEVERAL CREDIT UNIONS. AS I MENTIONED THERE IS ALSO A THIRD PROMPTED THE STRATEGY OR WE'LL GONNA BE COLLABORATING WITH EIGHTY YOU MANUFACTURERS AND BUILDERS AND BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS HOW TO REACH TWO WELL KNOWN AT MANUFACTURERS SUCH AS PERPETUAL HOMES IS ALREADY UNDER WAY. IN THE FUTURE WE ALSO EXPECT TO PARTNER WITH SOME OF THESE MANUFACTURERS LENDING PARTNERS. TO CREATE A TRUE ONE STOP SHOPPING EXPERIENCE SO. THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN ACCESS ET YOUR CONSTRUCTION AND FINANCING HI AND CONSERVATION. IN ONE SINGLE PLACE. SO WE HOPE THAT THIS BROUGHT YOU AN OVERVIEW OF OUR THOUGHTS ARE CALLING IF THEY HAVE THE UNIT ALIGNS PLAZA AS I DO SUMMER OF OUR- EIGHTY YOU OVER EIGHTY YOU. GRANT PROGRAM THANK AGAIN FOR THE UPPER TO STEP TODAY. HI I'M FROM THE MIDWEST IN IN EIGHTY YOU. WE ARE A- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO FRIENDS OF MARTI OF YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION VERY INFORMATIVE. AND NOW WE WILL GO TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER. TRISH ELLINGSON THAT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT CHIEF LENDING OFFICER FOR SAN MATTEO CREDIT UNION. HI GOOD MORNING EVERYONE- I AM REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING ON THIS BEAUTIFUL DAY- TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT EIGHTY FINANCING. I DO HAVE A PRESENTATION- THAT I BELIEVE- THERE WE GO HERE IT IS GOT EVERYBODY SEE THAT. YEAH WE CAN SEE A PERFECT OKAY GOOD GOOD- I ALSO WANT TO THANK GOD CHAIRMAN'S- GRAYSON AND WHISK- AND ALSO THAT WEEKS AND ALSO THE COMMITTEE TO FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- EIGHTY YOU FINANCING COMING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A PRODUCT THAT WE ACTUALLY CREATED AT SAN MATTEO CREDIT UNION. AND KIND OF TALK THROUGH A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER OPTIONS THAT THE TWO PANELISTS ALSO AHEAD OF ME SPOKE TO- WITH A LITTLE BIT OF REDUNDANCY MAYBE BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT JUST TO TALK THROUGH THAT- AND GIVE A LITTLE. BIT OF BACKGROUND ON WHY SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS WOULD WORK FOR AT SOME OF THE BORROWERS AND NOT FOR ALL OF THEM BECAUSE I THINK IT HELPS US- YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IRAQ ACTUALLY- REALLY ALIGNED SO. I THINK WE'LL LOVE GET STARTED HERE WILL GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THANK YOU I'M AT FINANCING OPTIONS WE DID TALK THROUGH A MINUTE BRIEFLY GO OVER SOME CASH CASH OUT REFINANCES- TALK ABOUT WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT WANTING TO REFINANCE AND- ONE OF THE- PANELISTS ALSO SPOKE TO THAT. A BECAUSE OF THE INTEREST RATES AND SO WE'LL TALK THROUGH WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE- I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT SOME HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT. A FIXED RATE SECOND MORTGAGES WHY SOMEONE WOULD CHOOSE THAT MAYBE OVER A LINE OF CREDIT. TO DO AN EIGHTY YOU- PROJECT AND BUILD AND THEN ALSO. I WANT TO FINISH UP WITH TALKING ABOUT AS SAM A TEAR CREDIT UNIONS AT U. CONSTRUCTION. HE WALKED PRODUCT THAT WE- CREATED- WITH WORKING WITH ONE OF OUR MUNICIPALITIES- STARTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND WHAT IT CAN BRING TO. SOME OF THE LOWER INCOME- YOU KNOW BORROWERS THAT ALSO DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EQUITY SO ALL. SHARE ALL THAT WITH YOU TOO AS WE KEEP GOING FORWARD HERE. BACKSIDE SO OPTIONS THE FINANCE WE HAVE CASH RIGHT THAT OFFERS LOTS OF FLEXIBILITY TO BUILD BASED ON YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON YOUR LIQUID FUNDS- THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS IS THE BARS WOULD PAY THE CONTRACTOR DIRECTLY THEY COULD HIRE A PROJECT MANAGER IF THEY WANT TO ALSO IT'S NOT NECESSARY OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE CASH YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT BECAUSE CASH IS KING- AND THERE'S NO LOAN CLOSING COSTS ON THIS SO IT SAVES THE PERSON OF BUILDING THE EDIE YOU A LOT OF MONEY UP FRONT VERSUS TRYING TO GET A LOAN SO. CASH IS KING IN MANY WAYS BUT THEN WE LOOK AT THE CASH OUT REFINANCES AND THEY ARE THE RESTRICTED 280% OF THE LOAN TO VALUE- YOU CAN GET A FIXED OR ADJUSTABLE RATE PRODUCTS WE HAVE SOME OPTIONS THERE BARBARA GETS INSTANT CASH THOUGH DIFFERENCE IN THIS VERSE IS DOING LIKE A HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT THEY START TO PAY BACK ON THAT- LOAN AS SOON AS IT'S FUNDED AT PERSONALLY- MANAGE THE COST OF BUILDING THEIR OWN EATING YOU SO THEY THEY AGAIN CAN THEY'LL HIRE A CONTRACTOR THEY CAN ALSO HIRE A PROJECT MANAGER. TO HELP OVERSEE THAT BUT YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS FOR ABOUT THIRTY TWO YEARS AND I'VE DONE A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION LOANS AND FOR ANYBODY THAT'S NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT IT'S NOT AN EASY ENDEAVOR TO TAKE ON BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AND THERE'S LOTS OF MOVING PARTS TOO INCLUDING YOU KNOW THE SPECS ON YOUR PROPERTY WHICH YOU CAN'T CAN'T BUILD ON AND- ALL THE COSTS THAT THEY'RE IN IN THAT GO ALONG WITH IT SO FINDING A PROJECT MANAGER ACTUALLY IS REALLY HELPFUL AND SOMETHING LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO- DO CONSTRUCTION LENDING. BECAUSE OF THE MANY MOVING PARTS THAT ARE THERE SO SOME PEOPLE DO OPT TO DO THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST DOING CASH OR CASH OUT REFINANCE AND I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT LATER TOO WIDE FOR THAT ACTUALLY IS REALLY GOOD AND HELPS THE BAR WORDS BECAUSE IT'S- IT HELPS PROTECT THEM ACTUALLY TO HAVE SOMEBODY AS A PROJECT MANAGER ALONG THE LINE I'M IN IN THE CLOSING COSTS OF COURSE- CLOSING BECAUSE AVERAGE ABOUT 1% OF THE LOAN AMOUNT SO AGAIN IF YOU DO CASH OUT REFINANCES THERE'S A COST TO THAT PERSON IS ACTUALLY. USING CASH IF YOU HAVE A LIQUID FUNDS AND- IF YOU YOU KNOW YOU WERE. YOU'RE RIGHT LOCKED SO YOUR RATES LOCKED ON A CASH. REFINANCE TYPE OF A LOAN. WHICH OFFERS PEOPLE A LOT OF SECURITY SO IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT MOVEMENT IN THERE. WHERE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THAT THAT RATE GOING UP WHICH WOULD ALSO MAKE THE PAYMENT GO UP TO. SO NOW WE TALK ABOUT A HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT FOR ANYBODY WHO'S NOT FAMILIAR WITH THEM. THEY WORK A LOT LIKE A CREDIT CARD. THANK YOU YOU GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT YOU ARE GIVEN FOR YOUR LOAN AND WHATEVER YOU DRAW ON THAT THAT'S WHEN YOU START TO PAY BACK ON IT. SO AGAIN WE DID SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ADD TO THIS WITH THE TWO OTHER PANELISTS THAT IT ONLY GOES TO AN 80% LOAN TO VALUE. SO THAT DEFINITELY IS A LOOK AT RESTRICTING FOR. BORROWERS THAT MIGHT NEED MORE EQUITY IN AND- WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT YOU'RE TO. INTEREST ONLY PAYMENTS DURING THE DRAW PERIOD TYPICALLY YOUR HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT. THEY HAVE A DROP. OF ANYWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN YEARS. AND THEN AFTER THAT IT BECOMES A FULLY AMORTIZED LOAN FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM. SO BUT FOR THE BEGINNING PIECE OF IT YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY INTEREST ONLY DURING THAT DROP PERIOD AND YOU CAN PAY DOWN PRINCIPAL ANYTIME YOU WANT TO SO THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE. IT ALSO MAKES FOR LOWER PAYMENTS ON AN INTEREST ONLY PERIOD. THAT PAYMENT PERIOD- PAYMENTS ARE BASED AGAIN ONLY AGAINST THE DRAWN AMOUNT SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN. A PERSON IS TRYING TO DO A HOME EQUITY. LINE OF CREDIT TO BUILD. A AN EIGHTY YOU- BASED ON SOME OF THE OTHER TOPICS THAT WERE ROUGHT UP EARLIER. WHICH COULD BE THAT IT MAY NOT. AND IT MAY NOT BECOME. IN TWELVE MONTHS AND IF YOU HAVE A SHORTER TERM LOAN THAT MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING. THAT WOULD WORK IN CASE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE UNIT GOES LONGER. IT IS AN ADJUSTABLE RATE SO THERE'S ANOTHER PART OF THIS LONG THAT. SOME PEOPLE AREN'T COMFORTABLE WITH BECAUSE THE RATES CAN MOVE ON THEM IT'S NOT A FIXED RATE. ALONE ITHAS A TWENTY FIVE YEAR REPAYMENT TERM THE MAJORITY OF THEM DO WHETHER THEY HAVE A TEN YEAR DROP OR A FIFTEEN YEAR DRAWN. AND THE BORROWER MANAGE THE PAYMENT MANAGES THE PAYMENTS TO THE CONTRACTORS ON THESE TYPES OF LOANS. SO ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES FOR THAT WOULD BE THAT IF THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH. INSTRUCTION OR HOW THE CONSTRUCTION PART OF IT WORKS. UP BASED ON WHAT THE CONTRACTOR IS SAYING IS COMPLETED ON THEIR PROPERTY- IT'S REALLY ANOTHER OPTION TO FOR THEM TO DO A PROJECT MANAGER WHO IS SEPARATE FROM. THE CONTRACTOR. THAT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW PROTECTS HOW THE DRAWS ARE REQUESTED. BASED ON THE ACTUAL WORK THAT'S FINE. SO THAT'S THAT'S HOW A HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT WORKS. ON THE FIXED RATE SECOND MORTGAGES. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE BETWEEN A FIVE TEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR TERM THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE. IT'S A SHORTER TERM LOANS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE HIGHER PAYMENTS SO THAT'S ALSO THE DOWNSIDE TO THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS EASY TO QUALIFY FOR THESE LOANS. ARE BECAUSE THE PAYMENTS ARE HIGHER SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE PERSON'S DEBT TO INCOME RATIO IS AND- AND THIS MAY OR MAY NOT WORK FOR THEM. FIXED RATE SECOND MORTGAGES TYPICALLY HAVE- A LOWER RATE TWO BUT BECAUSE THE TERM IS LONGER AGAIN THAT THE QUALIFYING IS A LITTLE HARDER- AND THESE ALSO GO. UP TO AN 80% LOAN TO VALUE ONLY. THANK THE PAYMENTS BE. RIGHT WHEN THE LOAN FUNDS SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN A HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT WHERE YOU'RE ONLY EIGHTEEN. AS THE LOAN. PROCEEDS ARE DRAWN. BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DO A FIXED RATE SECOND YOU GET THE MONEY RIGHT AWAY SO YOU PAY BACK ON IT STARTING FROM THE DAY THAT IT FINDS. A BORROWER WOULD ALSO MANAGE THE PAYMENTS TO THE CONTRACTORS ON THIS TYPE OF A LOAN. AT THE END OR HIRE A PROJECT MANAGER TO HELP THEM ALONG THE LINES TO. SO NOW I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. OUR HISTORY WITH. THIS PRODUCT THAT WE CREATED IT'S CALLED V. ET YOU. ARE KEY LOCK CONSTRUCTION LOAN AND WE STARTED ACTUALLY WE MET WITH THE- WITH CEMETERY COUNTY. OF HOUSING IN MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND THEY'VE REALLY BROUGHT US TO THE TABLE TO SAY THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY CAN HELP ASSISTANCE PEOPLE WITHIN THE COUNTY. TO BUILD AN EIGHTY YOU WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO HELP THEM WITH THE FINANCING OF IT AND- AND WE HAD SORT OF TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MAYBE DOING SOME TYPE OF EIGHTY YOU FINANCING BUT HADN'T REALLY. COME UP WITH A PRODUCT OR PROGRAM YET SO WE MET WITH THEM IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THEN WE WENT BACK TO THE OFFICE AND SAT DOWN AND REALLY. PUT PEN TO PAPER TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW COULD WE DO THIS SO THAT. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP NOT JUST THOSE THAT WOULD QUALIFY WITH THE HIGHER RATES. AND THE HIGH VALUES BUT- I'M SORRY HIGHER INCOME AND HIGH VALUES BUT SOME OF THOSE ALSO THAT WERE IN OUR BACKYARD THAT DEFINITELY DIDN'T FALL INTO EITHER OF THOSE CATEGORIES SO WE WANTED TO- AS A CREDIT UNION AS WE ALWAYS DO HELP OUR COMMUNITY AND- WE CAME UP WITH A PRETTY ROBUST PRODUCT THAT I THINK- IS. IT'S HELPING OUT PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE OPTION NOW THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THIS AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE BUT- WE ALSO WORK WITH HELLO HOUSING WHICH IS A NONPROFIT THAT SUPPORTS HOMEOWNERS IT'S A- IT'S A ONE STOP SHOP AND IT HELPS WITH. ALL PHASES OF BUILDING AN EIGHTY YOU AND INCLUDING THE DESIGN- THE COSTS THEY ACTUALLY REFER BUILDERS. AND THEY ARE THE PROJECT MANAGERS SO THEY WALK THE BAR WORSE THROUGH EVERYTHING FROM THE INITIAL PLANS TO PERMITTING. WHICH IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS FOR- PEOPLE THAT AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH CONSTRUCTION LENDING AND PATENT CONSTRUCTION BUILDING AND HOW TO. HOW TO ACTUALLY MANAGE THE WHOLE PROJECT SO. THEY'VE BEEN A REALLY GREAT SOURCE WITH US THEY ALSO. CREATED A PILOT. WHERE THEY BELIEVE THEIR- SERVICES TO SIXTEEN PEOPLE. IN A LOTTERY WERE ABLE TO- WINS THE LOTTO FOR FURTHER SIR. WHICH RUN. TWENTY DOLLARS. FOR WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO SO THEY DID THAT FOR FREE. I'M IN A PILOT PHASE THAT THEY WENT THROUGH AND NOW THEY HAVE EXTENDED IN THERE NOT ONLY IN SAN MATEO COUNTY THERE UP IN ALAMEDA AND- A FEW OTHER PLACES TOO I THINK IN SAN FRANCISCO SO. THAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL AND BENEFICIAL FOR. THE COLLABORATION TO WORK WITH THEM TO TALK THROUGH. WHAT OTHER OPTIONS CAN WE DO TO OFFER TO OUR BORROWERS THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THIS BUT- BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER. OPTION AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WAS. PRESENTED IN AND THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB- WE DID END UP LAUNCHING THE PRODUCT IN TWENTY TWENTY. AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE ONLY FUNDED THREE HE LARK CONSTRUCTION LOANS WHICH- WHICH DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT BUT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF- PEOPLE APPLYING FOR THESE LOANS THAT DIDN'T. NEED THIS TYPE OF A LOAN. AND WHAT WE DO IS WE LOOK AT THE- THE- THE APPLICATION AND THE APPLICANT THEMSELVES TO SEE IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BENEFIT THEM. OR IF ANOTHER OPTION OPPORTUNITY WOULD BE BETTER FOR THEM AND SO WHATEVER. WHATEVER TYPE OF LOAN FITS THEIR NEEDS FOR THEIR FAMILY. IS WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO PUT PEOPLE INTO AND- THIS IS JUST AN OPTION THAT WILL HELP THOSE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR SOME ADDITIONAL HELP TO ACTUALLY QUALIFYING. AND WE'VE CONVERTED BAR WAS TO MANY OTHER DIFFERENT PRODUCTS WE NOT NECESSARILY THE CASH ONES BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE CASH TO DO THIS BUT WE'VE DEFINITELY DONE SOME CASH OUT REFINANCES. WE'VE DONE HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT. AND ALSO- A COUPLE OF SIX SECONDS ACTUALLY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD- WE OFFER- THE OTHER PART OF IT THAT WE LEARN TO WAS. IT THE PIECE OF THIS THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS TO THE CREDIT UNION AND BANKS IN GENERAL IS. EDUCATING FARMERS AND YOU KNOW WE'RE OFFERING COMES WITH SOME EIGHTY FINANCING VIRTUAL SEMINARS ARE GONNA START THOSE THIS YEAR. YEAH THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A SLOW DOWN IN THE PROCESS FOR US TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING AT HOME LIKE PROBABLY SOME OF YOU AND MYSELF THAT ARE LOOKING AT THEIR KITCHEN AND THE BATHROOMS NEEDING TO BE REMODELED. AND SO THE CONTRACTORS ARE REALLY STRETCHED RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT AS MANY OUT THERE AND THEY'RE NOT AS AVAILABLE. AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T EVEN COME OUT TO START LOOKING AT BUILDING YOUR PROPERTY FOR THREE TO SIX MONTHS AND SO. THAT'S ACTUALLY SLOW THIS DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT ON ON THAT LEVEL TOO SO- WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE AND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION HE LIKE IT'S- IT'S A TEMPORARY SHORT TERM LOAN. I IS DESIGNED TO HELP THE BORROWERS FINANCE IN EIGHTY YOU ON THEIR OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTY ONLY- WE ACTUALLY ALLOW YOU TO USE YOUR YOUR FUTURE VALUE AND FUTURE RENTAL INCOME AND I'LL SHARE THAT WITH YOU IN A MINUTE YOU'RE ABOUT HOW THAT WORKS WITH OUR GUIDELINES ARE- AND IT'S REALLY FOR. YOU TO YOU. THE PURPOSE OF REALLY PRINT PRODUCING INCOME ON YOUR HOME OR TO PROVIDE A REDUCED AROUND THREE. AM YOU KNOW HOME ON THEIR PROPERTY A LOT OF EASY TO USE OR- LIKE STUDENTS COMING BACK HOME- THAT ARE LIVING HOME NOW BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE BAY AREA OR YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEN OTHERS THAT ARE ASKING. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE SOMEBODY THAT THAT THEY NEED TO LIVE ON THEIR PROPERTY TO HELP THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR DAY TO DAY FUNCTIONS AND WE'VE SEEN OTHERS THAT I. HAVE HAD THEM. BUILT THAT ARE HAVING PEOPLE THAT. WERE HELPING THEM. LIVING IN THE EIGHTY YOU NOW SWITCH OVER WHEN THE. HOMEOWNER IS YOU KNOW. AS HIS AGE OUT OF THE HOME. AND THEY NEED A SMALLER PLACE LIVE BUT THEY STILL NEED SOMEBODY. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GO INTO A- CONVALESCENT HOME SO WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN TO WHERE THE- THE HEALTH CARE PERSON. WAS LIVING IN THE EIGHTY WAS ACTUALLY MOVED INTO THE- MAIN HOME AND THE HOMEOWNERS HAVE MOVED INTO THE EIGHTY YOU SO. THEY CAN STILL STAY ON THE PROPERTY SO THAT'S ALSO ANOTHER BENEFIT OF THIS TO PRESS THAT WERE SEEN THAT WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT IT EVERY DAY ACTUALLY- NEXT LINE. SO THE CONSTRUCTION HE LOCK SO WHAT IS IT IT'S A TWELVE MONTH LINE OF CREDIT. IT'S IN SECOND LIEN POSITION IT HAS AN INTEREST ONLY PAYMENTS. IT IS A VARIABLE RATE. AND ITS ADVANCE MONTHLY SO WE DO THE DRAWS ON THIS LOAN. EACH MONTH AND- WE SET IT UP AS A TWELVE MONTH LINE OF CREDIT THE REASON WHY WE DID THE- THE TERM ON THIS IS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS. A AN END PERIOD. FOR THE R. WORD TO KNOW THAT ONCE THIS PHONE ENDS ONCE THE LOAN ENDS IN TWELVE MONTHS THE CONSTRUCTION HAS TO BE COMPLETED. AND THAT'S REALLY THE END FOR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO FOR THEM TO COMPLETED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND HAVE THE pPROPERTY TYPE AGAIN IT'S A- EXISTING SINGLE FAMILY HOME IT'S- OWNER UP. OCCUPIED AS THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE. OF THE DRAWS ARE PAID OUT MONTHLY WITH A 10% RETAINED EDGE- THERE'S- THERE SUBMITTED BY THE PROJECT MANAGERS SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY DO REQUIRE AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT- INTERNET LATER SLIDE- AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE A TEN PERCENT. RETAINED EDGE THAT'S RELEASED ON THE LAST DRAW REQUESTS SO. WE NEED TO SEE A- CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION FROM THE CITY AND THEN ONCE WE RECEIVE THAT BUT THE LAST STRAW THEN WE PAY OUT THE CONTRACTORS THAT THE REMAINING. MONEY THAT'S OWED TO THEM ALSO. GOOD IN THE NEXT FIVE. SO SOME OF THIS. ON THIS LOAN WHICH IS EXCITING FOR US IS THAT THE BORROWER CAN BORROW UP SO WE ACTUALLY OFFER THAT FUTURE VALUE WHICH- THE PANELISTS EARLIER WERE TALKING ABOUT- AND WE CAN ALSO USE THE FUTURE POTENTIAL THREATS AND SO WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE THE APPRAISER- GO OUT. AND DO AN ASK COMPLETED VALUE INCLUDING THE EIGHTY YOU. AND THEN THEY ALSO DO A RENTAL SURVEY ON TOP OF THAT FOR WHATEVER TYPES OF- COMPATIBLE SO THEY CAN GET IN THE AREA. THAT ALSO INCLUDE AN EIGHTY YOU FOR WHATEVER THE RATS ARE ON THERE. AND WE ALLOW THEM TO USE THAT TO QUALIFY. OUR MAXIMUM LOAN AMOUNT IS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND- YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN THESE. THESE MODULAR HOMES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TO THAT THEY CAN BUILD AND YOU KNOW THEY GO UP TO START SOME OF MY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND THEY GO UP TO I'VE SEEN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ACTUALLY- BUT YOU KNOW FORTY THOUSAND IS THE MAXIMUM THAT WE'RE COMFORTABLE DOING RIGHT NOW. AND WAIT THE MAJORITY OF THE ONES THAT WE'VE DONE I'VE BEEN ALL UNDER THAT LIKE AROUND THREE TWENTY IS KIND OF WHAT OUR AVERAGE- COST HAS BEEN. THE SCENE. OF THE LAWN CAN ACTUALLY INCLUDE THE FEES FOR THE PLANS. AND THE PERMITS THE TITLE UPDATES- THE APPRAISAL. AND THEN WE ALSO OFFER- IN THERE YOU CAN PUT SIX MONTHS OF YOUR PAYMENTS ON YOUR INTEREST. FOR THE LOAN YOU CAN BUILD THAT INTO THE LOAN SO WILL ACTUALLY PAY YOUR- MONTHLY PAYMENT FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OUT OF YOUR LOAN PROCEEDS. OUR LOAN REQUIREMENTS- WE HAVE TO HAVE A FULL OF MORTGAGE LOAN APPLICATIONS JUST LIKE APPLYING FOR ANY OTHER- HOME LOAN- WE UTILIZE A PROJECT MANAGER- WE- WE DON'T USE THE LIES WE REQUIRED THAT THE BAR WOULD UTILIZE. A PROJECT MANAGER THAT IS NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF THE CONTRACTOR. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THERE YOU KNOW A THIRD PARTY ESSENTIALLY AND THEY ARE THERE TO PROTECT THE- BAR WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE CONTRACTOR TO STAYS ON TIME AND THEY COMPLETE YOU KNOW THE PHASES THAT THERE SAID THEY SAID THEY WOULD DURING THAT. SAYS SCHEDULE THAT WE GET AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS OF THE LOAN APPLICATION. SO THEY KEEP THEM ON TRACK TO CLOSE WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS. AND THEY ALSO HAVE TO CONFIRM THE CONSTRUCTION PLAN- IN THAT IT CAN BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE BUDGET AND THE SCHEDULE SO. THAT'S WHY WE'VE RECORDED THAT- IN OUR- PROJECT FOR THE IN OUR IN OUR CONSTRUCTION SHE LOCKED WE ARE REQUIRING A PROJECT MANAGER ON ANY OF THE OTHER ONES THAT WE DO WE DON'T REQUIRE THAT WE JUST TALK THROUGH THAT WITH THE MEMBER TO EDUCATE THEM THAT THERE'S ANOTHER OPTION THAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT. IF THEY'RE DOING A CASH CASH OUT REFINANCE HE BARKER A FIX SECOND MORTGAGE- BECAUSE IT'S NOT REQUIRED BUT THIS WE FEEL LIKE PROTECTS OUR MEMBERS BY DOING THAT WITH THIS ONE- THE BORROWER COMPLETES THE HE LOCK BUILD LOAN AGREEMENT. WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ARE SIGNING IN THAT- THEY ARE. GREEN TO HIRE A PROJECT MANAGER USE A CONTRACTOR THAT HAS A LICENSE WITH THE STATE- AND- THAT THEY ARE VERIFYING THE COST BASED ANALYSIS THAT THEY AGREE TO THAT. THAT'S THE COST OF THEIR- PROJECT TO BE BUILT. BUT WE DO REQUIRE PRE CONSTRUCTION AS COMPLETED APPRAISAL SO WE DON'T WANT TO GO IN AND DO THIS LOAN FOR ANYBODY THAT'S ALREADY STARTED CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE THERE'S HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS BEHIND THAT AND SO WE CAN'T LOAN TO ANONE UNLESS THEY ACTUALLY- HAVE THE PRE CONSTRUCTION- AS- COMPLETED APPRAISAL DONE. AND THEN WE REQUIRE A FINAL- RECERTIFICATION OF THAT APPRAISAL SO AFTER TWELVE MONTHS WHETHER THEY REFINANCE INTO A FIXED SECOND MORTGAGE IF THEY'RE GOING TO REFINANCE INTO A NEW FIRST MORTGAGE- WE WOULD JUST NEED A RESTART OF THE APPRAISAL SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK AND PAY FOR A FULL APPRAISAL. YEAH I NEXT I. AM GUIDELINES SORGE. LOAN VALUE GOES UP 290% AS I SAID. AND 75% OF THE POTENTIAL RENTS USED TO QUALIFY OR- WE ALLOW FOR THE FOR THE BORROWERS SO. THOSE TWO ITEMS ALONE- HAVE HELPED THE THREE THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. THAT THEY HAD TAKEN OUT A HOME EQUITY LINE OF. CREDIT CONSTRUCTION LOAN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH- EQUITY IN THE PROPERTY AND THEY NEEDED THAT SO. THAT THE DIFFERENCE FOR WHAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT ON THESE IS THAT ARE THE FIRST MORTGAGE HAS TO BE KEPT AT EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE VALUE OF THE HOME AND THEN THE SECOND MORTGAGE COULD BE THE ADDITIONAL 10% SO WE GO UP 290% OF THE FUTURE VALUE BUT THE FIRST MORTGAGE STILL HAS TO STAY AT EIGHTY PERCENT. OUR MAXIMUM DEBT TO INCOME RATIO WAS FORTY EIGHT PERCENT. ARE ON OUR MEDICAL MINIMUM FIGHT GO SCORE ACTUALLY SIX EIGHTY SO I WOULD GO A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN WHAT AS SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS WERE. WERE SATING THAT- WHAT WAS ON THERE SO- BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE IT'S DEFINITELY. ARE AT 40% WITH A SIX EIGHTY CREDIT SCORE YOU KNOW WERE ABLE TO HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THAT- THAT THAT MEDIUM RANGE RIGHT THERE. IN OUR RATE IS ACTUALLY THE BUT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL PRIME INDEX MINUS ONE AND A QUARTER. SO RIGHT NOW TODAY OUR FLOORS AT PRIME RATE IS AT THREE POINT TWO FIVE. AND SO WE'RE DOWN AT THE FLOOR AT TWO SO. WE FEEL THAT IT'S A PRETTY. AGGRESSIVE RATE FOR OUR MEMBERS- IN ITS INTEREST ONLY PAYMENTS TO DURING THIS TIME PERIOD THAT THEY HAVE THE LOAN. AND THEY CAN PAY PRINCIPAL DOWN ANYTIME THEY WANT SO IT THERE'S NO WAY THAT PREPAYMENT PENALTY OR ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE THEY CAN'T. TO FOR SURE. ALTHOUGH THE NEXT LINE. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE STEPS THAT WE- THAT WE SHARED WITH THE POTENTIAL BORROWERS LIKE EXPLORE YOUR FINANCING OPTIONS LIKE SEE WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE THAT MIGHT BE MORE BENEFICIAL TO YOU. VERSUS YOU DOING A CASH OUT REFINANCE BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE REFINANCED OVER THE LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS AND I'VE GOTTEN THOSE GREAT LOW RATES ON THEIR FIXED MORTGAGES AND- THEY DON'T WANT TO TOUCH THOSE. SO WHAT'S ANOTHER OPTION FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WHERE THEY COULD BUILD. AND- ALSO STILL HAVE A DECENT. MORTGAGE PAYMENT THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO. BENEFIT FROM SOMEBODY RENTING SO THEY WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND INSURANCE AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL ON THE LOANS. AT CONTACT YOUR CITY PLANNING DEPARTMENT. YOU'LL FIND OUT WHAT THE PERMITTING IS HOW HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE YOU TO GET PERMITS TO GO THROUGH. LOOK AT WHAT THE SIZE EIGHTY YOU IS THAT YOU CAN BUILD ON YOUR PROPERTY AND- AND CAN YOU DO A MODULAR HOME NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO THAT BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE THE SPACE TO GET. THE MODULAR PIECES IN AND THEY'D HAVE TO USE A CRANE TO GO OVER THE BACKYARDS WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THAT AND PALO ALTO BECAUSE THE- THE PROPERTY LINES ARE SO CLOSE. I DISCUSS RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO HELP WITH. YOUR EYES I SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT- USING- THAT WE WORKED WITH HELLO HOUSING AND THEY DESIGNED THEY TOOK THE THEY TELL YOU WHAT THE COSTS ARE THEY HELP YOU WITH THE PERMITS. THEY DEFINITELY MANAGE THE PROJECT. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY ALSO OFFER LANDLORD TRAINING SO. THERE'S PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEVER YOU KNOW HAD OWNED A RENTAL PROPERTY BEFORE AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE A TENANT HOW DO YOU SEARCH FOR IT TENANTS HOW DO YOU FIND QUALIFIED TENANTS. YOU KNOW ALONG THOSE LINES SO THAT'S- WHAT SOME OF THOSE OTHER RESOURCES CAN HELP WITH THAT- EFFORT ALSO. EPA CAN'T DO EAST PALO ALTO CAN'T IT WAS ANOTHER- GROUP THAT'S DOING THE SAME THING AS HELLO HOUSING AND IT'S DONE IN EAST PALO ALTO. AND THEY'RE WORKING NOT ONLY WITH- YOU KNOW WE DO THIS ON. A REGULAR EATING YOU WE DO THIS ON A JUNIOR IN YOU. BUT THEY'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THE THOSE THAT HAVE HAPPENED. PROPERTIES THAT ARE ALREADY BUILT- THAT HAVE- IN EIGHTY WHEN THERE THAT MAY NOT BE. UP TO CODE AND UP TO STAY. AND SO THEY'RE TRYING TO HELP WITH- WORK WITH THEM ALL. SO THERE THEY'RE MANAGING THOSE PROJECTS PROJECTS ALSO SO THERE'S OTHER RESOURCES OUT THERE TO HELP OUR BORROWERS. AND THEN AGAIN IDENTIFY THE TYPE OF UNIT AS THEY SAID YOU WANTED YOUR MODULAR A STICK BUILT. A MODULAR DEFINITELY CAN GO UP A LOT QUICKER. AND THEY'RE YOU KNOW BUILT TO STANDARD YOU DON'T HAVE AS IT DOESN'T TAKE AS LONG SO THEY CAN START TO ACTUALLY. EARN THEIR THEIR RENTAL INCOME FASTER- PUTTING UP A MODULAR UNIT AND- THERE ARE SO MANY OF THESE NEW MODULAR. UNIT BUILDERS THAT ARE OUT IN THE BAY AREA THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TALKING TO ALL THE TIME ABOUT DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM TO. AND THEN MEET WITH CONTRACTORS TO GET THEIR VOTES THAT'S THE OTHER THING WE WANT TO SHARE WITH THEM THAT. IT'S NOT JUST THE ONE PERSON THAT YOU CAN TALK TO THERE'S DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND- YOU KNOW RESOURCES HELP. WITH FINDING OUT GOOD CONTRACTORS ALSO BECAUSE THEY ARE DEFINITELY TIED IN WITH THOSE. WITH THE RESOURCES- LIKE HELLO HOUSING THEY KNOW A LOT OF THE CONTRACTORS AND THEIR GENERAL CONTRACTORS THEMSELVES ALSO. SO THAT'S THEM THAT'S PART OF THE STEPS THAT WE SHARE WITH EVERYBODY AND THEN I THINK. OUR LAST FLIGHT YES SO. YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I'M I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THIS. OPPORTUNITY FOR JUST EIGHTY YEAR GROWTH ALL OVER CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW THAT. THAT WHERE WE'RE LOCATED IN THE BAY AREA IT'S DEFINITELY WARRANTS DAMAGING- COUNTY. YEAH THERE'S NOT A LOT OF. HOUSING PROSPECTS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT YOU KNOW HIGH COST THAT. THAT IN OUR BACKYARD WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP SO. REALLY REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY AND JUST HAVING THE CHANCE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. WITH EVERYONE TODAY SO THANKS A LOT. DRIZZLING SOME. YOUS VERY MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION AND IT SOUNDS LIKE- YOU ALL AT CEMETERY CREDIT UNION. ARE REALLY GOING ABOVE AN BEYOND TO. HELP WITH THE HOUSING AND ESPECIALLY IN THE- IN THE AREA OF EIGHTY USE I DO WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO BOTH COMMITTEES. FOR QUESTIONS. DO ANY OF THE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OF ANY OF THE PANELISTS AND I. KNOW THAT- FELLOW CHAIR- CHAIR WICKS HAS A QUESTION AND THEN WE'LL GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD. THANK YOU SHARE GRAYSON- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP WAS THE CONCERN THAT LENDERS CAN EASILY MITIGATE THE RISK THAT CONSTRUCTION WILL GET DELAYED- IN THIS THIS IS A CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF LENDING- OR EVEN HALT AT SOME POINT NOT COMPLETED- YOU KNOW I KNOW WE'VE DONE QUITE A BIT OF LEGISLATION YOU'RE DOING SURE RADIOS ARE STREAMLINED AND THEY CAN GET THROUGH THE PROCESS- BUT FROM. AN ANYONE FEEL FREE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION I HAVE A SECOND ONE AS WELL BUT WE'LL START WITH THIS ONE- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU THINK WE CAN DO LEGISLATIVELY TO ENSURE TAT STREAMLINING HAPPENS YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD AGAIN SOME BILLS HAVE GONE INTO EFFECT THAT HOPEFULLY WILL NOT MITIGATE AGAINST THAT BUT- ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN DO ON OUR END TO ENSURE THE STREAMLINING. IS CONSISTENT I THINK I'D MENTIONED EARLIER AND WHEN WILL YOU GET THAT STREAMLINING IS ODD TO HAVE- YOU KNOW HOW TO INCENTIVISE IN SOME FASHION THESE FACTORY ROAD IN OUR HOMES ARE ANALYZED- HOMES THAT YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES I REALIZE THAT WE JUST MENTIONED MIGHT NOT BE FEASIBLE TO HAVE A FACTOR BUT- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE YOU OUT. IF YOU HAVE TO GET INTO ONE OF ACCURACY OFFENSE RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW YOU MAY LOOK AT FINALIZED ON GIVE ME A LOOK AT OTHER AREAS THAT AFFECT YOU BUT HOMES MIGHT BE USEFUL AND MIGHT WORK BETTER SO I THINK THAT IS ONCE ONE AVENUE THAT YOU CAN TAKE TO MINIMIZE THAT RISK ONLINE FIRST. AND FOR YOU KNOW ANY PRETTY ENOUGH THAT J. AND SPEND MORE AID YOU CONSTRUCTION. I THINK THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF- PROMISED- YOU KNOW THE BEACH PROGRAM THAT MAY. EARLIER I HAVE AND YOUR COMPANY BUT YOU AT PEOPLE COME IN AND THEY USE THAT NETWORK OFF YOU KNOW APPROVED CONTRACTORS. TO DO THE WORK AND THAT GAVE THE CITY OF DETROIT AND THE PHILANTHROPIC PARTNER THE CONFIDENCE AND THE COMFORT. THEY NEEDED TO YOU KNOW. COMMITTED THIS PRICE AND YOU KNOW WHAT DONE. ACTUALLY SOLVE THE- PROBLEM THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO SOLVE WHICH WAS IN A PRISON YEAH. BEGIN AGAIN. IS NINE YOU KNOW GUYS COULD THINK ABOUT POSSIBLY DOING SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES STATE ARE TO HAVE MAYBE A CENTRAL REPOSITORY THE CONTRACTORS CENTRAL CLEARING HOUSE FOR- YOU KNOW CONTRACTORS THE POOL SO EVERY LETTER DOES NOT HAVE TO DO IT ON THEIR OWN AND GIVE YOU THE BEST TIME TO GET MORE STANDARDIZATION INTO THE PROCESS. AND MAKE IT MAD AND REDUCE COSTS AND UNCERTAINTY OR LETTERS TO THE LITTLE THINGS THAT WORKED OUT THERE AS POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW WHAT SOLUTION MIGHT WANT. THANK YOU I AM THAT M. WELL NOT QUITE THIS IS A- I THINK IT SHOULD BE NOTED CIVIL ONE- TO MISS ELLINGTON- EDITING YOUR PRESENTATION YOU SAID THAT SO FAR YOU ALL FUNDED THREE HE LOT CONSTRUCTION LOANS. I'M JUST CURIOUS THE NUMBER SEEMS LOW OBVIOUSLY THE PROGRAM JUST STARTED IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY BUT IS IT. IS THE CHALLENGE YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH APPLICATIONS OR THAT IT'S JUST STARTING DO YOU FORESEE IT GETTING BIGGER. YEAH GREAT QUESTION SO WE HAVE YOU KNOW AGAIN I. FEEL LIKE THE- PANDEMIC SLOWED DOWN THE CONSTRUCTION. AT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY START THAT THE CONSTRUCTION BUILDING BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE. WITH US WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD QUITE A FEW- THAT WE'VE HAD. AND APPLY FOR THE LOAN IT'S JUST WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONVERT THEM TO A DIFFERENT TYPE OF LOAN THAT SUITED THEM BETTER SO IT WAS MORE COST EFFECTIVE. TO DO A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR THEM SO WE ACTUALLY HAD PROBABLY LIKE. I THINK CLOSE TO NINETEEN I THINK OR TWENTY FIVE. NINETEEN OF TWENTY IS SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE LOAN APPLICATIONS THAT HAVE COME IN. BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY CONVERTED THE MEMBERS OVER BECAUSE IT JUST MADE MORE SENSE TO THEM FINANCIALLY NOT TO DO THIS LOAN AND THEY DIDN'T NEED THE- ADDITIONAL RENTAL- AND THEY DID NOT NEED THAT RENTAL INCOME THEY DIDN'T NEED THE ADDITIONAL FOR THE LOAN TO VALUE SO DIDN'T NEED TO GO 290% SO WE WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY MOVE THEM INTO A BETTER PROGRAM WHICH- IS PART OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO ANYWAY WE DON'T WANT TO PUT SOMEBODY IN THIS LONG THAT'S A TWELVE MONTH LONG TERM BECAUSE- IT DOES COST THEM AT THE END TO DO A REFINANCE AGAIN SO OUR GOAL FOR OUR MEMBERS IS TO. SAVE THEM AS MUCH MONEY AND HELP THEM WITH THEIR FINANCES. YOU KNOW ALONG THE WAY INCLUDING- JUST DOING A ONE ONE ONE IF WE CANNOT FRONT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER WORK YOU'RE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU CHAIRS- THANK YOU FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING TODAY REALLY HELPFUL AS WE'VE SEEN ESPECIALLY IN MY COMMUNITY USE BE A VERY ATTRACTIVE AND INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT OF HOUSING STARTS AS WE EXPEDITED IN. THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. THE SUN. I THINK- THE- AS WE'VE EXPEDITED THE STREAMLINING FOR BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE THE- HEAVY USE CONSTRUCTED- JUST. THROUGH BASE CITY PERMITTING PROCESS HE'S WE SAW A RAPID INCREASE IN THE TRACKING THIS- OF THIS HOUSING TYPE AND THEN I ALSO WANNA GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO THE SAN DIEGO. HOUSING COMMISSION THAT ALSO HAS WORKED FOR MODEL TYPES OF EDU CONSTRUCTION SO YOU CAN HAVE SORT OF A MENU OF SIX DIFFERENT- SORT OF PRE NOT DEAD. EVEN EVEN BEFORE PREFABRICATED HOME TYPES BUT AS THE MODELS ARE RIGHT THERE AND IF YOU LIKE ONE OF THOSE IF IT'LL FIT NICELY ON YOUR PROPERTY. IT HELPS YOU OVER THE CITY- FINANCING CITY PERMITTING PROCESS BUT ALSO I THINK MAKES A LITTLE TRACK OF LESS RISKY FOR A LENDER TO GET IN THERE KNOWING THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE. REALLY EXPEDITED THROUGH- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WORKS IS- NEW YORK NOTICE IS WELL ABOUT YOU KNOW THE KEY LOCK- UTILIZATION THERE AND I GUESS I WANTED TO ACT. AS LITTLE MORE BROADLY I'M PROUD FOR MR CALL- YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE SEEING RIGHT NOW MAYBE OVER THE PAST YEAR OR EIGHTEEN MONTHS. IN THE AGGREGATE OF THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THESE DIFFERENT HOUSING FINANCING MECHANISMS SO. HAVE WE LEARNED AND NOT FROM THE LAST- YOU KNOW- TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS TO BE ABLE TO SAY. THAT IT IS YOU KNOW JUST A DIRECT SECOND MORTGAGE OR THE HE LOCK FOR REFINING YOU KNOW THAT THE MARKET OR THESE POTENTIAL HOMEOWNERS ARE GRAVITATING TOWARDS ONE PRODUCT OVER ANOTHER. AND MAYBE THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO TRAIN OUR LEGISLATIVE AND BUDGET DECISIONS AS WELL. TO HELP- HELP WITH SOME OF THOSE OUT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SO. UNFORTUNATELY THE LAST TWO OR THREE OF US HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN THE ONE LATER DESCRIBED TO BE OUR MORTGAGE MARKET THE LAST WHAT'S YOURS IS VITAL. BECAUSE OF THE YOU KNOW THE INTEREST RATE THE SUBSTANTIAL MOVEMENT IN INTEREST RATES THE STOCK ON THE PENDING STARTED TWENTY TWENTY. WHEN YOU HAVE A GREAT SPOT ALL TIME LOW OF. WHAT THAT BEFORE IF YOU LOOK AT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC YOU KNOW WE HAD A HOME EQUITY LINE OF VIOLENCE ACT. WERE GROWING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT THE PLUS UNECONOMICAL FOR PEOPLE TO GO CASH OUT REFINANCE BECAUSE RATES HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN GOING UP. AND THEN RATES FELL IN SUDDENLY. ARE YOU SAW THE REVERSE HAPPENING THAT IS PEOPLE WHO- YOU KNOW PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN HE LOCKS. WERE NOW GRAVITATING TOWARDS CASH OUT REFINANCES TO REFINANCE. THEIR PRIMARY MORTGAGE. I OUT AND IN THE PROCESS HAS OPPOSED TO A FOR US. WEEK AND NOW. SO THAT AND THEN ORDER OF ONE TWENTY AND THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THE FED IS GOING TO BE INCREASING RATES. THIS YEAR AND THAT'S GOING TO PUSH UP BORROWING COSTS SO CASH OUT REFINANCE AGAIN WE EXPECT ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY PULL BACK AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY HAVE. ALREADY IMPLEMENTED A LOT FROM THE FEET. AND SO I THINK I THINK THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT IS THAT I THINK FOR AS FAR AS POLICY MAKING IS CONCERNED- YOU KNOW. WE CAN'T CONTROL INTEREST RATES OBVIOUSLY AND SO I WOULD ACTUALLY SUGGEST LOOKING AT A SOLUTION THAT ALLOWS. THAT CAN REDUCES FRICTION IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO THAT IF THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT IS MORE CONDUCIVE FAR SAY HOME EQUITY LENDING A HOMEOWNER THAT WANTS TO GO THAT ROUTE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT. BECAUSE AN INTERNSHIP IN MY MIND THAT YOU'RE AFTER MIGHT BE MORE CONDUCIVE FOR CASH OPS OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING ELSE I THINK. WE HAVE TO THINK BROADLY AND REDUCE THESE FRICTIONS ACROSS THESE PRODUCTS AND MAKE THEMSELVES SO THAT THEY CAN BECOME YOU KNOW WHY APPLE INTRACTABLE MOTORS REGARDLESS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING- TO INTEREST RATES. OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL I'M HEARING IS THAT YOU KNOW CHANGING MARKET DYNAMICS ARE PROBABLY ALSO GOING TO INFLUENCE YOU KNOW SORT OF THE- RELATIVE ATTRACTIVENESS OF ONE- PRODUCT TYPE OVER ANOTHER HOPEFULLY WE CONTINUE THAT PUT THE WORD OUT THERE AND GET THIS IS A MODEL- FROM HOMO HOMEOWNERS TO CONSIDER AND ACTUALLY UTILIZE- INTO THAT AND I'M WONDERING FOR MR MARTINI- AND HOW HAS IT BEEN GOING FOR THE- OUTREACH FOR YOUR PROGRAM TO. KNOW THAT YOU CAN GET A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR- AND BONUS OR OR SORT OF YOU KNOW- RIGHT OFF THE TOP- REIMBURSABLE GRANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP. SOME OF THOSE INITIAL COSTS- THAT THAT SHOULD BE VERY ATTRACTIVE I HOPE THAT THE- OUT REACHES THERE TO YOU KNOW MEET THE POTENTIAL- HOMEOWNERS THAT THAT MAY NOT BE AWARE OF IT BUT THAT MIGHT BE THE- THE DIFFERENCE IT ACTUALLY MAKES HEM. DECIDE TO GO AHEAD AND HIT THE GO BUTTON. THANK YOU FOR THE CALL- LET'S HAVE A NUMBER- YES WE BEEN IT MARK AND HOW WE TO THE AWARENESS ACTUALLY SO LAST SEPT. AND THIS HAS INCLUDED BUILDING UP PRESS RELEASE DEDICATED WEBSITE VIRUS EMAIL BLASTS TO ARE OVER TEN THOUSAND PERSONNEL MAINLY- LAST WEEK ALSO DOING A SHOW ON WHICH TO EIGHTY YOU GROUPS SUCH AS THE INDIAN HAWTHORNE AGASSI AND QUALITY CHECKS HAD ARRIVED- WE MENTIONED PART OF ORLANDO TRAININGS WHICH YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING THIS COUPLE OF OUR EXISTING DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PLATFORM SO. WHEN WE DO TRAINING SOME DATA. WE MAY NEED BE DONE INCREASE AWARENESS. WITH A- THAT WERE IN. THANK MAI SMARTEST. IN AND PARTNERSHIP. INCREASING ALL WHITE WEB OR ANY USE. AND NOW THIS WOULD POINT IN TIME WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW WHO ARE WE BUILDABLE LAND NOVEL TUNABLE BOSS- LEVEL WE ARE LOOKING. TO A NEW KIND OF THE NEXT STEP THE NEXT PHASE IN DATA COVERAGE AND MARKETING CAMPAIGN WITCHING IT'S GOING TO INCLUDE MORE TARGETED EMAIL SOCIAL MEDIA GEO FENCING. AND DIGITAL ADS TO HOMEOWNERS ADAM DID IT PARTICULARLY LIKE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO THEY KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM IS. NOT AVAILABLE SO WE'RE ALSO BUILDING. ARE YOU TOOL KIT. WITH MESSAGING ALSO SOCIAL. THAT WE- AND ALSO BECAUSE THEM FLY SIX AND AROUND THEM GONNA BE THIS. TO PARTNER. AND THEN IN ADDITION EIGHTY YOU SPECIFIC BUILDERS BOTH PRE FAB COSTUME WELL I'VE ALREADY JUMPED INTO THIS SPACE- AND- ALTHOUGH MANY DO HAVE PRE EXISTING FINANCING PARTNERS AND WE AND WE ARE AWARE THAT. SOME COULD BE SOMETHING. ON THE GROUND WITH THE FINANCING SO THESE ARE ALL THE STEPS WE'RE TAKING TO. INCREASE AWARENESS AND WERE VERY CRITICAL POINT IN TIME RIGHT NOW THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY TO TARGET HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES OR- YOU KNOW LOWER MIDDLE INCOME- FAMILY COMMUNITIES THAT. MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE OF THIS BUT YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT- BEFORE THE FUNDING RUNS OUT AND THEY'VE MISSED THAT OPPORTUNITY AND TO THAT AND I'M WONDERING. HOW MUCH OF YOUR INITIAL ALLOCATION FOR THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN DRAWN DOWN- SORT OF WHAT WHAT'S. THE STATUS OF THE- THE POOL OF FUNDING. YES YES AFTER OF YOUR- WIFE. OUR THE NET FACE STARTS IN- RIGHT NOW THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST LENDING NETWORK THAT FACE US ARE SOMEHOW. DOES INCLUDE A VERY TARGETED. AND GEO FENCED I'LL BE A SOCIAL MEDIA I'LL REACH. A REACH COMMUNITY OUTREACH SO WE ARE PARTNERING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS GIVING THEM TOOL KITS. TO SPREAD THE WORD BY NOW VERY KIND OF YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WE FOCUSED. OUR OWN WAY TOWARDS- ALTHOUGH LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF HOMEOWNERS THAT MAY BENEFIT FROM THIS RIGHT- OUR PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY IS DESIGNED. WITH A SOCIAL EQUITY FOCUS IN MIND RIGHT SO THAT AND THAT KIND OF TIES INTO THAT- AND TO. YOUR SECOND QUESTION ABOUT WHERE- WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NW IN THE IN THE- PROGRAM SO OUR OUR PROGRAM. IS ACTUALLY LITERALLY NOW. TRANSITIONING FROM THE STAND UP FACE. WHILE WE WERE ON BOARD LATER CALENDAR STRONG PHASE WHERE WE QUITE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. FOR A LONG AMOUNT OF CALIFORNIA TO APPLY. SO AS I SAID IN LAST FEW WEEKS REACHED A CRITICAL MASS OF SIX LENDERS AND SOME OF THEM IS ACTUALLY A REALLY BIG PLAYERS LIKE LOAN DEPOT HOME BRIDGE. AND GUILT SO WE'RE ACTUALLY IN A VERY GOOD POSITION TO STOP RIGHT NOW BECAUSE- STARTLING HER PRODUCT- SO I TREAT IS DISCOURAGED BY WELL TIMED AND- WE EXPECT THE APPLICATION. OF ALL INSIGNIFICANT LATE. SCALE AND THEN IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THANK YOU DOT MEMBERS PAMELA PLEASE KEEP YOUR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS PRECISE WE'RE COMING CLOSE TO THE END OF OUR JOINT HEARING- SOME REMEMBER C. R. TO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT. THIS QUESTION IS FOR OUR- MISS ELLING SEND IF SHE'S STILL ON. STILL ON MA'AM YES I'M HERE OKAY YOU KNOW. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE'S 90% RATIO WHEN YOU GET ATTACHED TO THAT TRIGGER A PMI WHEN THEY FORMALLY DID NOT HAVE ANY PMI. GREAT QUESTION NO YOU KNOW WHAT SO BECAUSE WE HOLD THE FIRST MORTGAGE AT EIGHTY PERCENT- IF YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST MORTGAGES ABOVE 80% THAT'S WHEN YOU GET A MORTGAGE INSURANCE ADDED ON BUT WE ARE HOLDING THE FIRST AT 80% AND THEN WE'RE DOING THE SECOND UP 210% SO. THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY MORTGAGE INSURANCE ON THAT SIR WOULD TRIGGER THE FIRST TO GO DO IT PMI SITUATION. NOW HAVE NOT AT ALL SO I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT WHATEVER WE DO. I'M TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY HAS TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE BURDENS OF. NOT ONLY THE LOANS ON THE PROPERTY AS WELL AS ALL OF THE OTHER COSTS AND THAT'S LONG TERM. AND- YOU KNOW RESTRICTIONS ON LANE LANDING THAT WE SEE THAT ARE CAUSING OUR OUR PROBLEMS. ARE BASED ON MASSIVE COLLAPSES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE PAST. IN OTHER WORDS WE NEED TO LEARN A LESSON WHAT HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT- I KNEW PEOPLE THAT WERE BUYING HOMES FOR. EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN AN EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLAR- SALARIES THERE'S JUST NO WAY YOU CAN A YOU CAN MAKE THAT WORK. AND YET SOMEHOW WE PUSH THEM OVER THAT LINE. SO THERE'S THREE THINGS WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS. ONE OF THEM IS IT'S KIND OF THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH FIRST DO NO HARM. WE NEED TO HELP WHERE WE CAN BUT WE CAN'T FORCE A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE. SECOND FOCUS ON LONG TERM SUCCESS BECAUSE- THE SHORT TERM NAVIGATION OF GETTING APPROVED. WE CAN TURN AND THIS IS A BIG FEAR OF MINE IS WE CAN TURN THESE HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE STRAPPED. INTO RENTER'S AGAIN. AND WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. SO I APPRECIATE ALL THESE- THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVED TODAY AND THAT'LL BE THE END OF MY COMMENTS THANK THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK SILVA. YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU TO ALL THE PRESENTERS- VERY GOOD INFORMATION I'VE BEEN KIND OF. REALLY HYPER FOCUSED ON EIGHTY USE AN INDIVIDUALLY HAVE ACTUALLY GONE DOWN A FEW PATHWAYS OF LOOKING INTO IT FOR OUR OWN HOME. I WILL SAY. THERE IS INDIFFERENT COMMUNITIES VERY DIFFERENT RESPONSES TO EIGHTY USE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRIS WARD WHERE THEY ALREADY HAVE PRE APPROVED PLANS- IT VARIOUS- OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO CHOOSE FROM A MENU. THAT'S REALLY THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THERE'S ALSO OTHER PLACES ARE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO HOLD BACK- AD USE- BUT- I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T CONTROL HERE AT ALL. HIS PEOPLE AND THEIR OWN PARTICULAR INTEREST SO FOR EXAMPLE IN MY OWN AREA- MY DAUGHTER WHO'S THIRTY TWO JUST TOLD ME ABOUT IT A. D. U. FACEBOOK GROUP. IN OUR OWN AREA OF THE CITY THAT I LIVE IN. AND THEY'VE ACTUALLY STARTED THIS FACEBOOK GROUP OF THAT KIND OF ORGANICALLY AND THEY'RE PUTTING CONTRACTORS THERE AND PRICES AND IN ESSENCE STEP ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE. I AND IT THAT'S REALLY COME OUT OF THE CITY. ITSELF DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO BLOCKADE TO USE SO IT IS INTERESTING IN THAT FACT BUT MY QUESTION IS AFTER ALL OF THAT- TO- MRS ELLINGTON IS ON YOUR- HE LOCK LOANS IT'S- SAN MATTEO- AT THIS POINT. DO YOU INTERFACE WITH OTHER CREDIT UNIONS ACROSS THE STATE IN A COALITION THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO. AN ESSENCE- AT THAT KIND OF SHOW THEM WHAT YOU WERE DOING AND BRING. THAT MODEL TO OTHER LOCATIONS- GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT YOU KNOW WE WERE ALWAYS COLLABORATIVE IN THE CREDIT UNION SPACE- WITH EACH OTHER- WE JUST HAVE NOT ACTUALLY. GONE OUT AND PROMOTED THIS WITH OTHER CREDIT UNIONS NOT FOR ANY. AT THAT POINT IN TIME BUT WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO IT BY ANY MEANS YEAH THE WHOLE POINT IS LIKE. THE CREDIT UNION WORLD IS AND IN BANKS IN GENERAL TOO BUT THE CREDIT UNION WORLD MORE SO. IS THERE FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND TO HELP YOU KNOW WITH EVERY ASPECT OF TRYING TO HELP SOMEBODY WITH THEIR FINANCES AND YOU KNOW THE EDUCATION PIECE FOR US IS HUGE. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AND YOU KNOW WE'RE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY TALKING ABOUT FINANCES WITH OUR MEMBERS ALL THE TIME FROM FROM ALL DIFFERENT ARENAS. AND PART OF THAT TOO CAN BE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS PRODUCT I A MUST WHAT IT OFFERS AND- YOU KNOW IN OUR INDUSTRY- THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF BEING INTO CREDIT UNIONS WE DO SHARE SO- YEAH WE'RE OPEN TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHERS FOR SURE ABOUT IT. THE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER CAREER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING TO ALIGN THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE AND BUDGET WITH REGARDS TO A POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS- CREATING A PATHWAY FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM AS WELL AS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS- MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT AND SPEAKING TO YOUR POINT ASSEMBLYWOMAN WITH REGARDS TO THESE FACEBOOK GROUPS IN MY COMMUNITY. THERE'S A TWO BEDROOM LITTLE BUNGALOW HOME RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO ME THAT AT SOME POINT MAYBE FIVE YEARS AGO MAY HAVE COST THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PURCHASE IT SOLD FOR ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT KIND NO ONE CAN AFFORD IN MY COMMUNITY AND IT'S CAUSING ALL KINDS OF A HOUSING SHORTAGES BUT ONE OF THE LARGEST CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAVE HEARD. IS FOREIGN INVESTMENT. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DIRECT THIS QUESTION OR WHO CAN ANSWER WHO CAN PROVIDE SOME KIND OF REPORT IN TERMS OF. HOW MUCH FOREIGN INVESTMENT IS BEING- IS BEING CREATED IN CALIFORNIA THAT DOESN'T ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO ACTUALLY BUY HOMES HERE. BECAUSE SO MUCH OF IT IS COMING FROM. THE OUTSIDE. AND THE FLIPPING AND THEN WE JUST HAVE LIKE A POPULATION OF RENTERS. AND SO I THINK ABOUT THAT IN A POLICY PERSPECTIVE WHAT CAN WE POSSIBLY DO TO UNDERSTAND THAT TREND. TO ENSURE THAT IT IS ACTUALLY CALIFORNIANS WHO LIVE THERE ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY BUY THESE HOMES. AT AFFORDABLE PRICES SO THAT FAMILIES CAN BE SAFE IN THEIR CALL ON IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT COMMENT. ON ON AT ALL IS THERE DATA OR INFORMATION ON ANY TYPE OF- EIGHTY YOU APPLICANT- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE TO BE A HOMEOWNER. THERE WOULD BE APPLYING FOR THE DEAL. IF THERE ARE NO COMMENTS ON THAT AS OF RIGHT NOW THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN GO AND LOOK INTO AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND DATA ON THAT- THROUGH- BOTH COMMITTEES. AND SO WITH THAT WE WILL NOW OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AS A REMINDER PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION AND PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF MEETING- AROUND A HALF A MINUTE FIRST THE IS THERE ANYONE PRESENT HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM THAT WAS JUST TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT.
