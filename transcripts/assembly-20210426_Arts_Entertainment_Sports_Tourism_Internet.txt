SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ARE YOU WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS- WHAT'S DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE WORKING WITH MY OFFICE- THE AMENDMENT WOULD CLARIFY THAT. AN INTERNET BASED SUBSCRIPTION STREAMING STREAMING SERVICES NOT A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. AB THIRTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO DISCLOSE WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE A POLICY IN PLACE TO ADDRESS ONE. THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION THAT COULD LEAD TO PHYSICAL HARM TO VERIFIABLE IN AUTHENTIC CONTENT. AND THREE PRACTICES THAT DECEPTIVELY MANIPULATE OR DISRUPT THE BEHAVIOR OF USERS. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS FORM AN INTEGRAL PART OF HOW U. S. ADULTS CONSUME NEWS. ACCORDING TO THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER IN 202053% OF U. S. ADULTS. GOT THEIR NEWS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. ALTERNATIVELY ARE STATISTICALLY ARE REPORTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT APPOXIMATELY 50% OF PEOPLE SHARED A NEW STORY ONLY TO FIND OUT LATER THAT THE NEW STORY WAS FALSE. RESEARCHERS AT UC SAN FRANCISCO FOUND THAT AFTER ALL FORMER PRESIDENT TWEETED THE TERM CHINESE VIRUS WHEN TALKING ABOUT COVERT NINETEEN THE NUMBER OF TWEAKS THAT USED THE PHRASE. ROSE BY. TWENTY TWENTY VIOLENT ATTACKS AGAINST THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER AMERICANS. COMMUNITY HAS SKYROCKETED IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF MISINFORMATION. SOME MAJOR PLATFORMS HAVE MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT IN COMMUNICATING WITH THEIR USERS AND THE PUBLIC. ON THEIR EFFORTS IN COMBATING THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION HOWEVER IT IS NOT CLEAR IF ALL PLATFORMS ARE DOING THIS AS WELL. AB THIRTEEN WOULD REQUIRE THAT PLATFORMS MAKE THOSE DISCLOSURES TO THEIR CONSUMERS THE BILL DOES NOT DIRECT HOW PLATFORM SHOULD CURATE THEIR CONTENT IT ONLY REQUIRES THE PLATFORM TO GIVE A DISCLOSURE. AND MAKE IT EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND ALSO THE COUNTY COUNCIL OR THE CITY ATTORNEY WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THIS STATUTE. IF AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE THE PLATFORM DOESN'T POST A POLICY THE WILL BE. A SUBJECT TO A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE A DAY. AB THIRTY FIVE IS NOT AN ONEROUS REQUIREMENT ON PLATFORMS BUT IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO STOPPING THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. I HAVE- TWO WITNESSES SO FIRST OF ALL PROFESSOR- EMERGE AMERICA SAID JOHN SIMS FROM MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW. AN EXPERT ON CONSTITUTIONAL LAW HERE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY I ALSO HAVE THE SUBPOENA TECH OR LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL FROM CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA TO TESTIFY. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GO TO THE PHONES. ALL. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS JOHN SAM'S DOT COM EMERITUS PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY THE PACIFIC MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW MY TESTIMONY TODAY IS THAT AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT AS BACKGROUND I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT I WAS A MEMBER OF THE LAW SCHOOL FACULTY BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MIGHT KILL THE SPECIALIZATION HAS BEEN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND IN PARTICULAR THE FIRST AMENDMENT. IN MY VIEW NO SUBSTANTIAL CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION CAN BE RAISED ABOUT EIGHTY THIRTY FIVE. THE BILL DOES NOT REGULATE SPEECH IT'S A CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTE IT MERELY REQUIRES PROVIDERS OF THE SERVICE TO INFORM USERS ABOUT IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS OPERATED. THERE ARE MANY DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLE TO THOSE PROVIDING GOODS AND SERVICES AT FIRST AMENDMENT LAW ACCEPTS THIS EVERYDAY PROCESS OF REGULATION WHICH PROTECTS AGAINST FRAUD EXPLOITATION AND OTHER INJURIES. AB THIRTY FIVE IS LIKE A REQUIREMENT THAT ONE SELLING A NEWSPAPER OR MAGAZINE HAVE TO PRINT THE SALE PRICE ON THE CAR OR THE FIRST PAGE. SIMILARLY ONE SELLING SOFTWARE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR PURCHASERS ABOUT WHETHER THERE WAS A WARRANTY. IN DEALING WITH EXPRESSION PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMEN THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THE LAW TO BE MORE PRECISE THAN WHAT IS EXPECTED FROM ONE OF THE BILL LEGISLATION. BUT THIS WILL HI IS QUITE DETAILED. ESPECIALLY AFTER THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENT. ARE OVER AT THIRTY FIVE DOES NOT REGULATE THE CONTENT OF SPEECH AT ALL IT DOESN'T EVEN TOUCH UPON THE TIME PLACE AND MANNER OF EXPRESSION. THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT PREVENT SHOULD CIVIL PROTECTION DISCLOSURES OF HESE TIGHTS. AND I AM CONFIDENT. THAT AB THIRTY FIVE WOULD EASILY SURVIVE THE FIRST AMENDMENT CHALLENGE IF ANYONE WOULD RAISE SUCH AN ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING TO MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU OUR NEXT WE HAVE SAVANNAH TO KERR FOR- FROM THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA BY TELEPHONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS BEGIN ATTACK OF THE CONSUMER DURING THE CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY FIVE THE TOPIC OF MISINFORMATION HAD BEEN HOTLY DEBATED ISSUE FOR SOME TIME NOW A DATA SHOWS AMERICANS ROUTINELY RELY UPON NEWS THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. THE FORMAT AS SOCIAL MEDIA REPOSE IN CLICKBAIT ALLOWS AND ENCOURAGES FOX NEWS STORY TO REACH MASS AUDIENCES. SMALL BIG NEWS ORIGINALLY ORIGINATED AND ELECTION NEWS NOW STARTED. BUT CAN DEMOCRATS DIRE CONSEQUENCES. ASIA OF HOW COULD AT BRAD THE NUMBER CASES. OF THE VIRUS CAME THAT ONLY BE CAN START TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD BUT IT BUDGET. A CRIME AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS. AT THIRTY FIVE IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TOWARDS TACKLING THE ISSUE BUT THE REASON COULD BE RETURNING TO THE STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND ALL ASKER COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MOTHER EARTH DAY. THANK YOU- I DO JUST HAVE A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF CLARIFICATION FOR WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY DOES AND WHO. AND HOW IT IS APPLIED I'M SOUL WOULD THIS JUST REQUIRE. A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. TWO ONE SEND THAT MSSAGE TO ITS USERS THOUGHT THEY HAVE A POLICY IN PLACE AND OR WOULD HAVE TO BE ATTACHED TO EVERY ARTICLE AND HOW ARE THEY DOES THE LANGUAGE DECIPHER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ARTICLE AND A POST FOR INSTANCE IF SOMEBODY WERE TO POST AN ARTICLE- AND LINK THE ARTICLE YOU CAN CLICK ON THAT. LINK AND IT GOES TO WHATEVER ARTICLE FROM WHATEVER MEDIA DOES AND MEDIA MEDIUM- BUT IF SOMEBODY WERE TO CUT AND PASTE AN ARTICLE ON TO THEIR OWN POST THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT SO WITHOUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION CAN YOU ADD SOME CLARIFICATION FOR ME SURE THANKS WE QUESTIONED THE LAW WILL REQUIRE THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM ITSELF TO POSE. SOME KIND OF A NOTICE TO THE USER OF THAT PLATFORM SO- IF YOU SAY THAT IS A ONE TIME- A SITUATION THAT IS THE CASE BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE OF NOTICEABLE IT HAS TO BE DISPLAYED ARE VISIBLE WAY TO THE USER SO IT COULD BE- THAT'S A ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE WEBSITE THE END UP YOU KNOW DOESN'T HELP YOU KNOW THE ARTICLE WAS RECEIVED OUR ARTICLES THAT. WOULD BE LINKED UP FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT THOSE ARTICLES HAVE TO BE- YOU KNOW GIVEN NOTICE AT THE REQUIREMENTS ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM ITSELF THAT'S A TWITTER OR OTHERWISE HAVE A FACEBOOK YOU KNOW THEY USUALLY HAVE A PIZZA OR COME YOU KNOW THE OF THE FIRST PAGE OF THE COVER PAGE. SO THERE HAS TO BE POST THERE ONCE. THE YOU FOR. AND I THINK THIS ALSO INCORRECT REFORM WRONG BUT IT ALSO BUILDS ON WHAT IS ALREADY BEING ESTABLISHED- IN THE LAST- IF YOU WANT TO SAY YEAR OR LONGER WHERE I KNOW THAT ON SOME OF SOCIAL MEDIA STORIES AND SO FORTH SOMETHING MAY COME OUT AND THEN YOU CLICK IT IT SAYS THE CONTENTS NO LONGER AVAILABLE BECAUSE EITHER THEY'VE ALREADY PUT OUT THAT IT'S FALL SO SOME OF THE PLATFORMS ARE ALREADY STARTING TO DO THIS EVEN WITHOUT THIS SO THIS JUST FOLLOWS THAT IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT I THINK. MANY OF THE MAJOR- SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE ALREADY DOING IT SOME DO MORE THAN OTHERS AND SOME ACTUALLY- YOU KNOW I'LL TELL YOU MORE INFORMATION THAN JUST YOU KNOW THE BUTTON SAYING THEY DO WHAT THEY DO NOT HAVE SUCH A POLICY SO BUT THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED OF THESE PLATFORMS OUT THERE AND ONLY CERTAIN MAJOR ONES ARE DOING TO US SO WE ARE ASKING THAT ALL PLATFORMS TO THE SAME. AND AGAIN WE ALSO HAVE TO BE DILIGENT OURSELVES TO DO YOUR RESEARCH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER- CHAU THANK YOU I THINK I KINDA UNDERSTAND YOUR ORIGINAL INTENT THE WHOLE WHENEVER IN ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION LIKE YOU ARE SAYING- THE MAJORITY THE MAJOR- SOCIAL PRODUCTS- PLATFORM SAID TO HAVE- THEIR DISCLOSURE- STATEMENT SIR- AND- YOUR INTENT IS SELF FOR OUR TO- DISCLOSER THERE ARE POLICY. ORGANIZERS OUR MY OWN ALICE'S SYSTEM MECHANISM TO ADDRESS SPREAD ALL WILL. MISS IN FORMATION- EVEN THOUGH. BY REQUIRING ALL DAHLE- PLATFORM SO TO HAVE TO DISCLOSE AVAIL POLICY. ONCE THE- DISCLOSE. DOES THAT. ALLOW THEM TO THIS COMMITTEE ON DEAL OWN DEFINITION WHAT THE MISINFORMATION OR BE HOW CAN YOU DEFINE WHAT I CAN DEFINE THEM WHAT IS A MISINFORMATION SO IN OTHER WORDS SO THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR MIND ANYTIME. THE AGENCY I TREAT THE ASSESSORS FOR MISINFORMATION. YOU MENTIONED- NAY TURN OF IRIS. HALL HALL HALL CAN YOU'LL RULED IT THAT DOES SOME MISINFORMATION IN ALL SAW THAT WORRIES ME I THINK THERE IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION WE WANT TO MAKE OF THE BILL ONLY REQUIRES THE PLATFORMS TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE SUCH A POLICY IT DOES NOT ACTUALLY REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF THE POLICY- SILVA SO THERE IS IT'S A MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO. BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT ASKING THESE PLATFORMS TO TELL US WHAT THE POLICIES FAR WE JUST ASKING THEM WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE SUCH A POLICY. AND AS FAR AS THE DEFINITION ITSELF IT'S THE IT'S LISTED IN IN THE LAW ITSELF HOW YOU KNOW HOW WE DEFINE A MISINFORMATION IT PASSED TO MEET ONE OF THE ACT ACTUALLY HAS TO MEET THE THREE CRITERIA THAT THAT'S LISTED IN THE LAW- I MEAN JUST READ HIM OFF LAW SO THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION THAT THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE RISK OF IMMINENT VIOLENCE. OR PHYSICAL HARM OR TO REDUCING THE SPREAD OF HARMFUL VERIFIABLE IN AUTHENTIC CONTENT IT WAS A DIFFICULT STORIES AND NUMBER THREE PRACTICES THAT ARE INTENDED TO DECEPTIVELY AND SUBSTANTIALLY MANIPULATE OR DISRUPT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE USERS SO IT WOULD HAVE TO MEET THOSE THREE CRITERIA ARE YOU KNOW TO CONSTITUTE A MISINFORMATION IN THIS CONTEXT. BUT BUT ONCE AGAIN THAT THE MAJOR DISTINCTION IS THAT WE'RE NOT ASKING THE PLATFORMS TO TELL US WHAT THOSE POLICIES ARE BUT WHICH THIS ASKING THEM TO TELL US WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE SUCH A POLICY. ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES AND THEY HAVE TO MEET THIS OF THREE CRITERIA THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING WHAT ARE THE POLICIES THAT WOULD ADDRESS THOSE THREE- ALL CONDITIONS CORRECT BUT WE'RE NOT WE DON'T NEED TO WE DON'T NEED. TO KNOW WHAT THOSE POLICIES ARE UNDER THIS LAW. AND BY THE WAY THE DEFINITION OF FOR MISINFORMATION WAS A PRODUCT OF- THE- THE LAST YEAR YOU KNOW THE- LAST YEAR'S WORK IN FACT WE WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN COMING UP WITH A DEFINITION THAT WOULD COVER. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE- THE ACTUAL PRACTICE. OF THE INDUSTRY. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO WE HAVE A QUORUM WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD AND- TAKE ROLE IN RICK SILVA HERE QUIKSILVER HERE ABOUT THE DENNIS NOT MANY. MATHIS WILL TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE. CALAVERAS HERE BLOOM. BLOOM HERE TO.

AB THIRTY FIVE CHAU DO YOU PASS AS AMENDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUICK SILVA A QUICK SILVA I ABOUT THE DENNIS. THE LATEST NOT VOTING BLOOM BLOOM ONLINE TO. CHOI CHOI NO FRIEDMAN. NAZARIAN THE BILL PHONE CALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE ON FILE AND I AM TO AB. THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. USE ADULT ATHLETICS CHRONIC DRAMATIC. THE FOUR. THE SERVICE HELLO THE P. I NEVER GET IT RIGHT SO I'LL JUST SAY C. T. E. K. I WOULD SAY THAT I WAS GOING TO SUBJECT FOR THAT. SO THIS IS ABOUT THE ISSUE YOUTH TACKLE FOOTBALL NOT YOUTH FLAG FOOTBALL BUT YOUTH TACKLE FOOTBALL. IN THE ISSUE OF C. T. YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THE LAST DECADE OR SO MORE AND MORE RESEARCH ON THE DANGERS. OF REPETITIVE TRAUMA TO THE HEAD. AND YOUTH ESPECIALLY PLAYING TACKLE FOOTBALL STARTING AT A YOUNG AGE WE ALL KNOW COMMONSENSE GETTING HIM THE HEAD. OVER AND OVER IS NOT A GOOD THING FOR ANYBODY ESPECIALLY LITTLE KIDS COME WITH KIND OF LIKE WE HEAR THE ISSUE WITH. SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME- KIDS BRAINS AREN'T FULLY DEVELOPED AND SO HAVING REPETITIVE HITS TO THE HEAD. IMPACTS THE YOU KNOW THE BRAIN. AND LATER IN LIFE- COULD HAVE BOB HURRICANE TAXES SOME OF THESE IN ADULTS WHO GET C. T. E. SO. JUST AS THERE IS RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT SMOKING IS BAD FOR EXAMPLE WE ALL KNOW THAT BUT THE YOUNGER YOU START SMOKING THE GREATER YOUR RISK OF GETTING. CANCER AND OTHER LUNG DISEASE- IT IS THERE IS THERE IS NO CRYSTAL CLEAR- YOU KNOW. GOTCHA TYPE RESEARCH HAS THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AS A STATE BUT THERE IS. A LEADING RESEARCH OVER AND OVER AND OVER I'M TALKING ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THE AGE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE START PLAYING TACKLE FOOTBALL. AND THE IMPACTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH ITSELF DOWN THE LINE THESE THESE COULD LEAD TO INCREASED HEADACHES DEPRESSION ANXIETY POOR MEMORY YOUR ABILITY CONCENTRATION- ISSUES- SUICIDE AND SO FORTH. SO WHAT WHAT THIS BILL- WOULD DO IT WOULD ASK OUR STATE SURGEON GENERAL TO CONVENE A COMMISSION. ON CTP AND YOUTH TACKLE FOOTBALL. TO INVESTIGATE ISSUES RELATED TO THE RISKS OF BRAIN INJURY. AND TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ANY FINDINGS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE WHETHER OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE A MINIMUM AGE. TO PARTICIPATE IN YOUTH TACKLE FOOTBALL. YOU KNOW THERE IS A MINIMUM AGE TO PER. AND USED IN SMOKING FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T HAVE. A TWELVE YEAR OLD SMOKE BY LAW WE ONE HAVE START SMOKING FOR PREFERRED LET NO ONE SHOULD SMOKE BUT- LAW WE HAVE A CERTAIN HE'S DOING THAT- THEY'RE NOT SAYING THERE SHOULD BE A MINIMUM AGE THAT CERTAINLY. HAS BEEN DEBATED BEFORE IN THE PAST THIS WOULD ASK OUR STAR SURGEON GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA. TO RESEARCH THE ISSUE AND GET BACK TO US- THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION WITH US TODAY I HAVE A PARENT WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THIS- WITH- HER- FAMILY MEMBER PLAYING YOUTH TACKLE FOOTBALL. AS WELL AS A LEADING RESEARCHER WITH THE CONCUSSION LEGACY. FOUNDATION AND- IN MASSACHUSETTS THANK YOU BASS SPEAKER MADAM CHAIR. OKAY SO WE WILL GO AHEAD AND GO TO THE WITNESSES AND ON THE PHONES. FOR SHOULD I START I'M YES I WILL JUST START WITH OK. OKAY IS THAT OKAY- GOOD AFTERNOON YEAH MY NAME IS JAN FRANKLIN. MY SON AND ONLY CHILD JASON DIED BY SUICIDE ON JULY FOURTEENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX. MY FRIEND WITH THE LIFE OF THE PARTY HE HAD PERSONALITY AND CHARM GALORE AND HE LOVED LIFE. I GRADUATED COLLEGE AND WAS JUST BEGINNING HIS MEDIA CAREER WHEN THINGS STARTED TO GO AWRY. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. HE WAS HAVING HEADACHES HE COULDN'T SLEEP HE SUDDENLY BECAME WITHDRAWN HE WAS THREATENING AND SHOW THE RAGE I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE. I TRIED TO HELP THEM BUT THINGS HAPPEN TO THAT. GESTURE AFTER HIS DEATH THE CORONER IN ARIZONA WHO WAS AWARE OF JASON'S FOOTBALL HISTORY SUGGESTED WE SENATE'S BRAIN. THE BOSTON UNIVERSITY TO BE ANALYZED PROCEEDING. JASON WAS DIAGNOSED I'M SORRY GIPSON GRAYSON WAS DIAGNOSED TO HAVE C. T. E. STAGE TO. THE CITY IN DAMAGE WAS ANALYZED AND WAS FOUND TO BOTH BE MOSTLY IN THE ENVELOPE OF THE BRAIN TO CONTROL IMPORTS JUDGMENT BEILEIN'S AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR DEPRESSION AND SUICIDALITY. EVERYTHING WE EXPERIENCE. SO WHY THIS HAPPENED. MY SON STARTED PLAYING TACKLE FOOTBALL AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN SOME BOYS STARTED AS YOUNG AS FIVE. LITTLE BOYS CRASHING THERE HAD BEEN EACH OTHER IN FACT THE FIVE YEAR OLD TO BE THE HEAD FIVE HUNDRED TIMES THIS SEASON FIVE HUNDRED TIMES. AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WOULD DAMAGE HIS BRAIN UNTIL YEARS LATER. IN HONOR OF MY SON WE CREATED A FIVE POUND ISSUE BECAUSE I GOT YOU. TO HELP THOSE IN NEED. UNDER THIS PROGRAM WE'VE REACHED OUT TO PLAYERS AND JASON TO LET THEM KNOW THAT WE'RE HERE TO HELP THEM. WE'VE HAD A FEW CONTACTED. ONE PLAYER XANDER IS STRUGGLING NOW WITH HEADACHES AND DEPRESSION. HE STARTED PLAYING TACKLE THE YOU. TO OTHERS ONE OF MICHAEL ALSO HAVE CONTACTED ME AS THEY ARE CONCERNED THEY HAVE BUT THEY ALSO STARTED ISSUES. THEY'RE ALSO STRUGGLING WITH DEPRESSION. WE NEED TO STOP THIS. IF I KNEW THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW I WOULD NEVER NEVER HAVE LET MY SON PLAY YOUTH TACKLE FOOTBALL. PLEASE SUPPORT AB THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT. THE SURGEON GENERAL COMMISSION CONFIDE LEGISLATORS. AND PARENTS WITH THE ISSUE INFORMATION I WISH I HAD. YOU WANT TO SEE HOW BY PROVIDE SON WAS GO TO JASON FRANKLIN FIFTY FIVE .COM WE'LL SEE. WHAT WE LOST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE. CHRIS NOWINSKI PHD CO FOUNDER AND C. E. O. OF CONCUSSION LEGACY FOUNDATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HE SAID MY NAME IS DR CHRIS NOWINSKI CO FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE CONCUSSION LEGACY FOUNDATION ALSO A CO FOUNDER OF THE BOSTON UNIVERSITY CTE CENTER FOR ELITE EDUCATION IN PUBLIC POLICY EFFORTS. I HAVE A PHD IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE FROM BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE PRODUCT TO OFFER MY ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT. OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS ROBUST SCIENCE HAS DISCOVERED A STRONG RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN PLAYING TACKLE FOOTBALL AND DEVELOPING THE DGENERATIVE BRAIN DISEASE CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY. THE DISEASE THAT CAUSES PROBLEMS WITH COGNITION AND YOUR BEHAVIORAL DYSREGULATION AND EVENTUALLY RESULT IN DEMENTIA. BOSTON UNIVERSITY IN US DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SCIENTISTS RECENTLY PUBLISHED AN EX FOOTBALL PLAYERS ODDS OF DEVELOPING CTP INCREASE. 2230% PER YEAR. THAT MEANS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOOTBALL AND DEVELOPING CTE MAY BE AS STRONG AS THE LINK BETWEEN SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER. AND TO ME THAT MEANS THAT WE MAY WANT TO THINK TWICE ABOUT EXPOSING MORE CHILDREN TO THIS HARM. JUST OF THE SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT HELP TO STOP UNNECESSARY HARM FROM CIGARETTES I BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA SURGEON GENERAL'S COMMISSION ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUTH TACKLE FOOTBALL C. T. WILL HELP US CUT THROUGH. INDUSTRY PROMOTED BAD SCIENCE AND TALKING POINTS TO BUILD A CONSENSUS REQUIRED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO YOU ALL TO PROTECT CHILDREN. I'M NOT AGAINST FOOTBALL I'M A FORMER ALL IVY HARM FOOTBALL PLAYER WHO KNOWS THE BENEFITS OF TEAM SPORTS. BUT THE FACT IS HUMAN BRAINS ARE NOT MEANT TO TAKE THOUSANDS OF ITS OF ITS TO THE HEAD. ESPECIALLY NOT THE BRAINS OF CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE DEVELOPING. THE LAST DECADE EVERY OTHER MAJOR TEAM SPORTS AMERICA HAS REFORM TO THEIR GAMES TO ELIMINATE PREVENTABLE REPETITIVE HEAD IMPACTS FOR KIDS. SOCCER'S BAND HEADING ICE HOCKEY FAN CHECKING. WHAT FOOTBALL IS STOCK PUTTING FOUR POUND HELMETS ON FORTY POUND CHILDREN BECAUSE THERE'S NO NATIONAL GOVERNING BODY TO ENFORCE REFORMS. THAT WERE UP TO ME WHO HAS SEEN THE HARM THAT FOOTBALL. CAN BRING TO THE BRAINS OF NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED FOOTBALL PLAYERS INCLUDING JASON FRANKLIN WHO STARTED. AT OUR BRAVE BACK THE SPORT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED THREE YOUNG CHILDREN. I BELIEVE THE SURGEON GENERAL'S COMMISSION WILL HELP INFORM BOTH PARENTS AND LEGISLATORS ON THE RIGHT WAY TO CHANGE YOU FOOTBALL TO PROTECT. THE BRAINS AND FUTURES SHE ALL. THANK THANK YOU BUT I WILL ASK FOR ANY OR FOR THE COMMITTEE. FROM AMERITRADE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARC MCCARTHY THANK YOU ALL FOR THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE YOU BRING UP- TEAM OVERALL THE CONCEPT DISCUSS RB SUPPORTING BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION- I YOU KNOW- THE ESPECIALLY YOUNG CHILDREN NOW- OF CLASHING DEBATE HEADS TOGETHER OBVIOUSLY IT'LL IMPACT OF. I WONDER- THAT THERE HAS BEEN KNOWN SEVENTY AT ALL SO THIS IS TO ESTABLISH A COMMISSION TO STUDY SUCH AN IMPACT ON THE PLANET GOT YOU KNOW A DRAMATIC IMPACT THE WHOLE OF THE CHILDREN WHEN. ANNA K. F. A YOUNG US AFTER LISTS ARE ARE INVOLVED- OBVIOUSLY THERE WOULD BE I MEAN I I'M ASSUMING THIS- THROUGH ALL THE NEW SITE HERE AT THAT THE BIG NEGATIVE IMPACT IS THERE. BUT THE- IF AND WHEN IT IS SET TURNED OUT TO BE- DRAMATIC THE IMPACT- AND A SUBSTANTIAL- PERCENTAGE OF- HE HIGH SCHOOLER FOOTBALL PLAYERS SELL WILL TURN OUT TO BE- NOT IMPACT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. SEOUL ARE IS THERE ANY POTENTIAL THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL MAY BE BANNED IF ASSIST TO FINDING A SAID DISCLOSED. THANK YOU OUT I JUST LIKE TO KNOW DOCTOR CHOI THAT MY NEPHEW IS AN OUTSTANDING HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYER IN ORANGE COUNTY HE PLAYS FOR. IN IRAN TO START SANTA MARGARITA FOR- IS COPPER LAMA HIGH SCHOOL. AND- HE- HE STARTED PLAYING TACKLE FOOTBALL WHEN HE WAS IN THE EIGHTH GRADE. AND SO IF YOU WATCH THE SUPERBOWL A FEW WEEKS AGO THIS THE WINNING QUARTERBACK THE BEST QUARTERBACK IN HISTORY AN NFL. TOM BRADY DIDN'T START PLAYING TACKLE FOOTBALL UNTIL HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL SO IF I HAD MY WAY AND I'M NOT SAYING AT THIS BILL IS NOT THAT- YOU CAN YOU CAN PLAY FOOTBALL AND LEARN ABOUT. PASSING CATCHING BLOCKING IN OTHER STUFF WITHOUT HAVING A HELMET ON WHEN YOU'RE EIGHT NINE TEN SOMETIMES SIX SEVEN YEARS OLD UP TO THIRTEEN AND START PLAYING TACKLE ONCE YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL SO THAT'S WHAT I WOULD PREFER BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT. IT JUST SAYS SHOULD THE SURGEON GENERAL STUDY THIS ISSUE AND COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ON- APPROPRIATE AGE FOR YOUTH PARTICIPATION. AND I THINK I THINK THE SURGEON GENERAL- IS A TALENTED INDIVIDUAL AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE PLATTER OF RESEARCH IT'S OUT THERE ARE READY. TO COME UP WITH SOME EVALUATIONS BUT THE ANSWER QUESTIONS NOW IS NOT GOING TO- I DON'T THINK BANTOCK FOOTBALL MANY PARENTS ARE WALKING WITH THEIR FEET RIGHT NOW ANYWAY AND THERE IS. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER THIS MORE KIDS UNDER TWELVE PLAYING FLAG FOOTBALL THAN TACKLE AND THEN THEY CAN SWITCH TO TALK WHEN THEY'RE LITTLE OLDER BECAUSE- THEY'RE THEY'RE MORE MATURE KIDS REACH PUBERTY THEY HAVE THAT THE HEAD NECK SHOULDERS THAT CAN HANDLE THE HELMET THAT CAN HANDLE. THE REPETITIVE HITS SO. FERIA THANKS NOT IS A TOUGH DIGEST DATA WILL HELP THROUGH OUR SET UP BUT DIFFERENT- PRACTICE POLICIES ASSESS ETCETERA SO I THINK THAT THERE MAY BE SOME. IN A MODIFIED THE PRACTICE THAT DEPEND UPON THE DATA THAT IS BEING COLLECTED I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT A STUDY. AT THE UPPER PORTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOMED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND TO THANK YOU MR MCCARTY FOR BRINGING US SO WHAT I THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL AND IT- RELATES TO- SOMETHING I THINK THE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR- AMERICANS AND CALIFORNIANS AND THAT'S EFFECTIVE WE- ON A VARIETY OF FRONTS DO NOT. DO A VERY GOOD JOB ON THE ISSUE OF PREVENTION. OF WE DON'T DO ENOUGH ON PREVENTION FOR EXAMPLE OF PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS OF WE DON'T DO ENOUGH TO PREVENT WILDFIRE. AND WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE. OF ISSUES. LIKE DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE SENT TO MANY OTHER DISEASES- OF THAT IN MANY CASES ARE ENTIRELY FOR PREVENTABLE. WE DON'T DO MUCH THIS IS YET ANOTHER- AND VERY IMPORTANT AREA- WHERE THESE HEAD INJURIES- ARE. ALMOST ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE- AND- SO THIS THIS BILL. AS YOU JUST A VERY ELOQUENTLY- STATED ASSEMBLY MEMBER- GOES A LITTLE BIT IN THAT DIRECTION- IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH AND IN MY VIEW BUT- I THINK IT IS GOOD THAT IT ASKS THE SURGEON GENERAL WHO ARE CLEARLY IS VERY CAPABLE OF- PUTTING TOGETHER- THAT THE MINES THAT ARE NEEDED TO LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE MORE DEEPLY AND COME OUT WITH A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND I HOPE THAT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL. LEAD US TO A DAY WHERE WE DON'T TO SEE THE KINDS OF TRAGEDY- THAT OUR WITNESS SPOKE UP IN THE- MANY OTHER CHILDREN WHO HAVE SUFFERED AND IN MANY CASES LOST THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF OUR FAILURE TO TAKE ACTION ON THIS VERY PREVENTABLE- CIRCUMSTANCE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM AND I'M OF THE BILL. WE'VE GOT A MOTION AND A SECOND AND THEY BELIEVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND NAZARIAN DID YOU WANNA MAKE A PROMISE I JUST WANTED TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR'S WORK I THINK IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS WHEN YOU BROUGHT OF THE DIFFERENT BILL BUT SIMILARLY. ORIENTED IN TARGETING WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH- I HAD AUTHORED CO AUTHORED IT WITH YOU OR AND I KNOW THAT I SUPPORTED IT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR STEADFAST WORK ON THIS ISSUE I THINK IT'S CRITICAL AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT. AS MANY THINGS HERE THAT WE WORK ON WE NEED TO CONTINUOUSLY BE THE ADVOCATES TO EDUCATE OUR CONSTITUENCIES AS WELL SO THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT IS EXACTLY WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH- AND HOW WE'RE TRYING TO HELP- ARE CONSTITUENCIES IN SPECIALLY THOSE AMONGST US THAT- MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT IS GOING TO BE FOR THEIR- BEST. INTEREST IN THE FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES. THANK YOU AGAIN. AND THIS BILL IS A DO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BY TWO AS THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AM VERY. MUCH INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC ON NOT ONLY ON THE SURGEON GENERAL CONVENING A COMMISSION ON CHRONIC DRAMATIC- BONTA SAID THAT WORD AGAIN AS- SIMPLE. AS A FOLLOW UP THE P. AT BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS AS AN EDUCATOR MYSELF. IS WE DO THINGS. AS EDUCATORS THAT WERE TAUGHT TO DO AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO UNDO THINGS AS WE LEARN MORE INFORMATION SO I THINK THIS WILL BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HEAR WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL. HAS TO SAY ALONG WITH THE COMMISSION AND TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND- PERHAPS THERE WILL BE A CHANGE I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR IS AT ALL IS TRYING TO STATE. THAT THERE WILL BE A BAN ON CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL- BUT I THINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND- MADAM SECRETARY CAN YOU.
