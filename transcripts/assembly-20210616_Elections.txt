SB THIRTY FIVE PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED CLARITY AND AFFORDS DROP BOXES WILL BUCK PROTECTIONS AGAINST ELECTION NEARING. IT ALSO MAKES CLEAR THAT ELECTION OFFICIALS ESTABLISH DROP BOXES. AND NO ONE ELSE. DURING THE EARLY PERIOD LAST YEAR I SATURDAY POOL OF THE RALLY OF AROUND HUNDRED TRUMP TO. GATHER IN THE PARKING LOT GOOD PRINCIPLES BLOCK ACCESS TO THE DROP BOX IN OUR PARKING LOT WHICH AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE CURRENT ONE HUNDRED FOOT ELECTIONEERING BOPPERS OF. ALL ADVOCATE HAD ENGAGED IN SOME FORM OF PROHIBITED ELECTION. SUCH AS LARGE FLAGS WITH THE CANDIDATE'S NAME AND LIKENESS DECORATING NEARLY EVERY CAR ARE HAPPY T.

WILL BE REVIEWED HOW THE ELECTION WENT IN IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL ISSUES WE SAW IN THE FIELD DURING THE VOTING PERIOD. WE DISCUSSED WITH SENATOR- BURKE IN THE CONFUSION AT VARIOUS VOTING LOCATIONS REGARDING THE ELECTIONEERING BUFFER. AT THE HONDA CENTER WHICH WAS THE BOAT CENTER SUPERSITE- THAT WAS ONE LOCATION WHERE THE ISSUE OF ELECTION BUFFER NEEDED MUCH CLARITY. THERE WAS A LOCAL CANDIDATE THAT WAS UNCLEAR ABOUT ELECTIONEERING INTERPRETER THE LONG AS MEANINGFUL FOR ONE HUNDRED FEET FROM THE ENTIRE VENUE. NOT FROM THE ENTRANCE TO THE VOTING GROWN. AT SOME VOTE PRINTERS WE ALSO WITNESSED ISSUES WITH LONG LINES DUE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING PROTOCOLS.

BY THE GOOD CENTER NEWMAN. THANK YOU AGAIN SO THAT THAT WAS THE SHOW BEFORE THE MAIN. FEATURE AND THIS WILL I SUSPECT NOT BE NEARLY AS PRETTY SO MISTER MEMBERS AYE I AM HERE BEFORE YOU DID ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF SB SIX SIXTY. IT'S PROVISIONS WILL PROHIBIT COMMON PRACTICES IN THE GATHERING SIGNATURES FOR BALLOT MEASURES WHICH INCENTIVIZE THE WILLFUL DECEPTION VOTERS IN SO DOING SB SIX SIXTY WILL TAKE NECESSARY AND IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARDS SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF CALIFORNIA'S INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL PROCESSES- BEFORE I BEGIN PLEASE KNOW THAT I'M ACCEPTING ALL OF THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS- WITH PARTICULAR APPRECIATION FOR THE EAGLE EYED PERSON WHO SPOTTED THE MISPLACED APOSTROPHE- IN THE CAGED ON PAGE THREE LINE THIRTY NINE IS. A SUSPECT WAS EVEN THAT WHICH SHOULD HAVE READ AS THE POSSESSIVE FORM OF IT OF THE PLEURAL ATTORNEYS NOT THE SINGULAR- BUT BACK TO THE BILL NOW AS YOU MAY BE AWARE% AND IF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES. CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF A NUMBER OF STATES WHOSE CONSTITUTIONS EXPRESSING PROVIDED CITIZENS WITH TOOLS TO DIRECTLY REDRESSED ABUSES OF GOVERNMENT OR MALFEASANCE BY PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN OUR CASE IN THE FORM OF THE INITIATIVE THE REFERENDUM AND RECALL- FIRST HISTORICAL BACKGROUND CONTEXT. THESE ADMIRABLE AND USEFUL CONSTITUTION DIRECTOR MARK TO PROVISIONS DATE BACK MORE THAN A CENTURY AND ARE THE LEGACY OF A GROUP OF PROGRESSIVE REFORMERS LED BY THEN GOVERNOR HIRAM JOHNSON. WHO WENT ON TO BECOME CALIFORNIA'S LONGEST SERVING REPRESENTED UNITED STATES SENATE. THOUGH HIS TWENTY YEARS IN OFFICE WAS RECENTLY ECLIPSED BY OUR OWN CENTER DIED FEINSTEIN. AS A RESULT OF THE EFFORTS OF GOVERNOR JOHNSON AND HIS SUPPORTERS CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION THROUGH THE INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL MAKES EXPLICIT PROVISIONS THROUGH THE UNIT THAT MAKES EXPLICIT REYES THAT ALLOW FOR THE CITIZENRY TO TAKE ACTIONS. OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL ELECTION LEGISLATIVE PROCESS USED IN ORDER TO ENACT OR REPEAL LEGISLATION OR TO REMOVE A CORRUPT OR MALFEASANCE ELECTED OFFICIAL FROM OFFICE. TO THE ORIGINAL FRAMERS WAY OF THINKING THE INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL REPRESENTING MEANS FOR THE LITTLE GUY TO ACHIEVE DIRECT CURATIVE AND REFORMIST ACTIONS THAT ELECTED INVESTED INTEREST MIGHT OTHERWISE SUPPORT. BECAUSE THE FRAMERS OF THE INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL REGARD THESE PROCESSES AS POPULIST ACTIONS OF LAST RESORT THEY DELIBERATELY PROVIDED THAT IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT THE PROPONENTS OF ANY OF. THESE DIRECT TO THE VOTERS PLAY BESIDES WOULD FOR FIRST BE RE. TO GET A SHIFT NUMBER OF VOTERS. IN IN SO DOING VALIDATE THE LEGITIMACY AND POPULAR SUPPORT FOR SUCH AN ACTION. OVER THE YEARS ESPECIALLY IN RECENT DECADES HOWEVER SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. THAN THE FRAMERS INTENDED HAS TRANSPIRED THESE TOOLS OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY. HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVELY CO OPTED. BY THE VERY MONEYED INTERESTS THEY WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO OFFSET. AS WELL FUNDED GROUPS WITH INCREASINGLY EXPLICIT SELF AND MOTIVATIONS. HAVE BECOME EVER MORE ADEPT AT USING THE INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL PROCESS IS TO THEIR BENEFIT. SOMETHING OF AN ARMS RACE AROUND THESE PROCESSES HAS ENSUED ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO SIGNATURE GATHERING. AT THE CENTER OF THESE EFFORTS THE SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIALIZED FIRMS WITH EXPERTISE IN SECURE GATHERING. HAVE RISEN TO THE FORE OFFERING THEIR SERVICES TO PROPONENTS. SEEKING TO PLACE A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL TACTIC USED BY THE SPECIALIZED TOGETHER INFERENCE IS THE DEPLOYMENT OF WELL TRAINED. PROFESSIONAL SIGNATURE GATHERERS. TYPICALLY THE SIGNATURE GATHERS ARE PAID ON A PER SIGNATURE OR COMMISSION BASIS. ALSO KNOWN AS THE BOUNTY. AT A RATE DETERMINED BY THE MARKET AS IT IS AS IT IS SAYS AT THE TIME. DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE INITIATIVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DISTRICT. THE TIME OF YEAR COMPETITION WITH OTHER NATIONS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. THE COST PER SIGNATURE FOR A- PARTICULAR ISSUE CAN VARY WIDELY FROM AS LOW AS TWO DOLLARS PER SIGNATURE. GATHERED TO AS HIGH AS TWENTY DOLLARS PER SIGNATURE. AND BECAUSE BOUNTY PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS ARE INCENTIVIZED OPTIMIZE. THEIR YIELD BASED ON HOW RAPIDLY THEY CAN SECURE SIGNATURES FOR SIGNATURE FROM VOTERS. THEY FRANKLY TRAFFIC AND MISDIRECTION MEETING MISLEADING INFORMATION AND OUTRIGHT FALSEHOODS. IN ORDER TO INDUCE AS MANY VOTERS AS POSSIBLE TO SIGN. IN THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP THE DETERMINING FACTOR GETTING A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT TOO OFTEN HAS LESS TO DO WITH ITS POLICY MERITS. THEN THE DEPTH OF A PROPONENTS POCKETS OF COURSE THIS IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. OF WHAT THE FRAMERS HAD MINE. AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THESE PERVERSE INCENTIVES THE PAPER SIGNATURE SYSTEM. HAS IN FACT SUBVERTED IN MANY CASES THE ORIGINAL IDEALISTIC CONTENT OF CALIFORNIA FOUNDERS. WHO ENVISION A PEOPLE POWERED SYSTEM OF REFERENDA AND PROPOSITIONS VALIDATED BY DEMONSTRATED PUBLIC SUPPORT. AND WHICH X. OR FAIL ON THERE MAY. NOT ON HOW WILL THE YSTEM CAN GAMED. THE INITIAL REFERENDUM A RECALL PROCESS HE'S CAN AND SHOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT VALUE ROLE IN CALIFORNIA POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT. IT HAS BECOME CLEAR HOWEVER THAT UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM. DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE BOUNTIES. THERE ARE SCANT PROSPECTS FOR DETERRING BAD ACTORS WHO WILLFULLY MISLEAD VOTERS AT THE EXPENSE. OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. SB SIX SIXTY ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY PROHIBITING THE PRACTICE OF PAYING SIGNATURE GATHERS ON A PER SIGNATURE BASIS. WHEN COLLECTING SIGNATURES TO PLACE A STATE. OR LOCAL INITIATIVE REFERENDUM A RECALL ON THE BALLOT. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS CORRECTLY NOTES THIS MEASURE WOULD NOT PROHIBIT PAYMENT FOR SIGNATURE GATHERING OTHER WEIGHTS TOGETHER STILL CULD BE PAID AN HOURLY WAGE. OR SALARY OR OFFER BONUSES BASED ON PERFORMANCE. THIS GOOD GOVERNMENT MEASURE WILL SERVE TO STRENGTHEN OUR RECALL REFERENDUM ISSUE PROCESS BY ENSURING THAT VOTERS ARE AWARE. OF EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE SIGNING AND NOT BEING DECEIVED ULTIMATELY SB SIX SIXTY WILL HELP TO RESTORE INTEGRITY. AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN CALIFORNIA'S PROVISIONS. FOR DRAMATIC DIRECT DEMOCRACY THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE ASSURANCE. AND TRANSPARENCY THE VOTERS AND IT'S ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS WILL PERMIT BOTH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ANY PERSON. TO BRING A CIVIL CLAIM UNDER THE SECTION FOR PROCEDURE PAYMENT PRACTICES. EMPLOYERS VIOLATE THE PROVISIONS OF SB SIX SIXTY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A FINE OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. OR FIFTY DOLLARS PER SIGNATURE FRAUDULENT GET THIRD WHICHEVER AMOUNT IS GREATER. OTHER STATES SUCH AS COLORADO MONTANA AND OREGON HAVE ALREADY EXAMINING ISSUES SURROUNDING PAID SIGNATURE GATHERS. AND HAVE IT PLEDGES CAN PROHIBIT PERSINGER BOUNTY PAYMENTS. REQUIRING INSTEAD THE PAYMENT PROCEDURE GETTING MAY ONLY BE MADE ON AN HOURLY OR SALARY BASIS. IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO DO THE SAME. OUR DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE WILL BE THE BETTER FOR IT I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THIS MORNING. THANK YOU CENTER. AND YOUR PRESENT LAWCENTER ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT HE'S OUT CLEARLY- NEXT TIME I WILL BE BRIEF FOR. SO WE HAVE A- ONE NOW MOVES TO- PRIMARY WITNESSES WE DO NOT HAVE ANY PRIMER WHEN THIS ISN'T SUPPORT- SO WE WILL MOVE TO POWER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE DO HAVE- SHOW OF MUHAMMAD. FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. VIA PHONE- MISTER MUHAMMAD IF YOU'RE THERE. YES I AM YOU WEREN'T READY WHEN YOU ARE- JUST A REMINDER YOU HAVE. TO BELIEVE IT'S TWO MINUTES- LET ME CONFIRM THAT SOMEONE GETS THAT YEP TWO MINUTES PERFECT. THANK YOU THANK YOU HONORABLE CHAIR AND- AND MEMBERS- MY NAME'S WHAT MOM TO THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB SIX SIXTY WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL TO ADDRESS ELECTION INTEGRITY THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL DUE OUT WAY OUT OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT ARE CONTEMPLATED BY LANGUAGE. SB SIX SIXTY INTENDS TO ADDRESS ELECTION INTEGRITY BY PROHIBITING SIGNATURE COLLECTION ON A PARTICULAR BASIS FOR STATE OR LOCAL INITIATIVES REFERENDUMS THE RECALL PETITIONS BY THE GREATER BOB- TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR FIFTY DOLLARS FOR EVERY SIGNATURE GATHERED. BY BANNING SIGNATURES GATHERING ON A PER SIGNATURE BASIS THIS BILL FORCES PEOPLE TO BEAR THE COST OF HIRING OUR EMPOWER EXCUSE ME HOURLY EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS WITH HOURLY EMPLOYEES TO COLLECT SIGNATURES AND DISINCENTIVE BY THOSE WORKERS FROM COLLECTING THOSE SIGNATURES BY DOING THAT SB SIX SIXTY NOT ONLY SLOWS DOWN THE GATHERING PROCESS BUT- MAKES A PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE. TO CIRCULATE INITIATIVE OR RECALL NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO PROPOSE A REFERENDUM BUT IN ADDITION TO CIVIL PENALTIES IN ADDITION TO THE INCREASED COST OF CIRCULATING A PETITION. SB SIX SIXTY ALSO MAKE CALIFORNIA BALLOT BOXES WITH THE RISK OF FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION BY CREATING A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO ENFORCE ITS PROVISIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE BALLOT PROCESS WITH THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THERE IS A TANGIBLE THREAT. THAT WELL FUNDED LITIGATION DESIGNED TO STRATEGICALLY TO PRESS PUBLIC PARTICIPATION COULD SLOW THE PROCESS ERODE THE PUBLIC TRUST AND INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE CITIZEN LEVEL AFTER IT'S BECOME BURDENED WITH PREDATORY LAWSUITS AND JUDICIAL INTERVENTION. THAT'S THE COST OF EVERY INITIATIVE REFERENDUM A RECALL PETITION WOULD NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR SEPARATE FUNDING TO DEFEND AGAINST THE POTENTIAL FOR LAWSUITSBASED ON THIS BILL. SB SIX SIXTY WOULD LEAVE THE INITIAL PROCESS TO THE DOMINION OF THOSE WHO HAVE THE MONEY TO EMPLOYER AND CONTRACTOR HOURLY WORKERS TO COLLECT SIGNATURES AND WHO CAN AFFORD TO DEFEND OR PROSECUTE LAWSUIT REGARDING THE SAME. FINALLY THE BILL ONCE FOR DEMONSTRABLE PROOF OF FRAUD STEMMING SPECIFICALLY FROM THE PAYMENT PER SIGNATURE NOT THE COLLECTION INDEED COMMITTEE AND OUT OF SIGHT AND PERMISSION. AND MAY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE APPROXIMATELY LAST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS THE OFFICE IS OPEN LOOKING THREE HUNDRED CASES FOR POTENTIAL PETITION FRAUD OF WHICH ONLY FIFTY FIVE WORK FOR THE PROSECUTION DOES WELL WE APPRECIATE THAT SB SIX SIXTY IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS ELECTION INTEGRITY WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL AND WE THINK- FOR ALLOWING US TO HER THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MUHAMMAD.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF CARE- SEND NEWMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING A SPORT I HOPE YOU'LL ADD ME AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE LEGISLATION I'M WITH THE BILL. GOT A MOTION BUT TO. GOT A SECOND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISMAS. SO I'VE- THERE'S BEEN A COULE OF BILLS- IN THE PAST- THAT- I DID NOT BUT THE NOT SUPPORT- AND I'M STILL NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT I'M GONNA DO WELL WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE ABOUT TO TAKE A VOTE. ON THIS BILL- THE REASON- THERE'S A COUPLE REASONS THAT I'M- THE FIVE ONE QUESTION IN THE MAYBE WE GOT A STATEMENT HERE TO IS- WHY PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WHY IS THAT NECESSARY AND SO IT'S I THINK IT'S A GOOD QUESTION SO WE HAVE ADDED THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION I TO ADDRESS PRECISELY- WHAT MR MAHAMA NOTED THAT THEY HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN RELATIVELY FEW- COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATION OF THE EURASIAN AND WE ATTRIBUTE THAT FACT. TO THE TRUE THAT MOST OF THOSE WHO ARE IN POWER RIGHT NOW TO ENFORCE EXISTING ELECTION CODE WHICH MAKES IT EXPRESS ILLEGAL MAKES IT A MISDEMEANOR TO ATTENTION MISLEAD A VOTER AS TO THE NATURE INTENT OF A CENTURY RATIONS ABOUT MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POWER TO ENFORCE THE LAW OR THEMSELVES ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE THEMSELVES POLITICAL ACTORS. AS A RESULT THEY ARE THOROUGHLY DISINCLINED TO INSERT THEMSELVES INTO THIS PROCESS- AND SO ALTHOUGH ANECDOTALLY WE KNOW THE NUMBER OF. VIOLATIONS IS OF A MAGNITUDE HIGHER- THERE'S BEEN A LACK OF ENFORCEMENT- INTO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO REALIGN THE SYSTEM. SO THAT WE GET A GREATER LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY. I THERE'S BEEN TO BE- A. B. NINETY FORTY SO AND ALSO AB FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE THAT- THAT THE TIME TO DO THIS VERY SAME THING ONE WAS. A VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN THE OTHER ONE WAS- VETOED BY GOVERNOR SOME WISE THIS BILL DIFFERENT. RIGHT YEAH I CAN I THINK OF SOME OF THESE THINGS TAKE TIME I THINK IS WORTH NOTING THAT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER LOWE'S IS THE AUTHOR OF MOBILIZATION MADE THROUGH. THE LEGISLATURE. AT THE EVIDENCE OVER TIME HAS I THINK- A CREW THAT DID THAT THIS IS NECESSARY AND TWO MISSED SOME MISTER HOBBS COMMENTS. IT IS NOT TRUE OR CERTAINLY NOT TO MOST WHICH- THAT THIS WOULD INCREASE THE COST OF ELECTIONS- WHAT IT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD INCREASE THE ACCOUNTABILITY WITHIN. YOU KNOW SINGS GETTING PROCESS- THAT IS A GOOD THING AND I SUSPECT THIS GOVERNOR HAS SEEN FIRST HAND. HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND- I AM HOPEFUL THAT IF AND WHEN THIS BILL NEXT TO HIS DESK ON THIS OCCASION- THAT HE'S INCLINED TO SIGN I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT AS I'VE DONE. INVESTMENT HEARINGS THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT. ON THE CURRENT RECALL EFFORT AGAINST THIS GOVERNMENT SERVICES MEANT. TO MOVE FORWARD- MATTER- TO THE AS I SAID TO IMPLEMENT A BETTER INTEGRITY ACCOUNTABILITY. OKAY I DO NOT BUT THE REASON WHY I'M- INSTEAD OF JUST A JUST OPPOSE THIS OUT RIGHT NOW I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS A BIT- IS SAID RECENTLY- I WAS. INFORMED ABOUT- A GENTLEMAN DOWN IN. I ONE OF MY TO COUNTIES- WHO WAS OUT COLLECTING- A TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO REGISTER FOR A NEW POLITICAL PARTY. AND- WHEN- MY FRIEND WALKED IN- TO THE STORE. THIS GENTLEMAN HAD SAID- YOU KNOW WOLD YOU PLEASE- EVERY REGISTRY NEED TO RE REGISTER- AND SO- I THIS PART IN BACK OUT AGAIN. I FOUND ANOTHER A LADY WHO WAS- RE REGISTERING AND- I WONDER THEY RE REGISTERING ACTUALLY- MY CHECK. CHECK THE BOX- OTHER. UNDER THE PARTY AND THEN IT WAS GOING TO WRITE IN THE NAME. OF THIS NEW UP PUT POLITICAL PARTY- AND WAS TELLING US. THAT THIS LADY THAT THIS WAS REQUIRED AND THERE ACTUALLY WAS WITH RAGING IS INDEPENDENT. THE INDIVIDUAL GETTING PAY. ON A PER RIDE REGISTRATION REGISTRATION BASIS SO TO YOUR PROBLEM TO THE PROBLEM THAT'S HERE THERE'S A LOT OF BAD ACTORS THAT ARE. THAT ARE OUT THERE AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU FIX THAT- AND- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE ANSWER A BUT THERE CERTAINLY DOES NEED TO BE. BE A FIX BECAUSE THERE ARE BAD ACTORS THAT ARE OUT THAT ARE- THAT ARE TELLING PEOPLE- ONE THING- AND- I JUST SO THAT THEY CAN GET GET GET PAID AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOUR- INTENT IS BUT I JUST THINK THERE'S SOME ISSUES. I'M HERE WITH THIS AT THIS BILL SO I APPRECIATE THAT ASSEMBLY MINNESOTA THAT IS PRECISELY. MY INTENT- AND I THINK THAT YOU'VE- WELL ARTICULATED A TYPICAL USE CASE- WORKWHERE THAT SIGNATURE GATHER. IF THEY WERE NOT BEING PAID PER SIGNATURE GATHERED. WOULD NOT BE ACTING IN THAT FASHION- AND IF YOU CAN REMOVE THAT DISTORTING INCENTIVES. FROM THE SINGER GETTING PROCESS. YOU CAN YOU CAN RETURN THE ASSURANCE TO VOTERS THAT IF AND WHEN WE MEET THE THRESHOLD RIGHT FOR ANY OF THE THREE. PLAY BESIDES THE RECALL THE INITIAL RUN RUN RUN. WHEN WE MEET THAT THRESHOLD THAT IS THAT WAS MEANT TO BE THE PROOF. OF THE VALIDITY OF THE ACTION WHERE YOU INTRODUCE YOU KNOW THIS IS SYSTEMIC INCENTIVES- AND HOT YOU KNOW HIRE PROFESSIONALS TO GATHER SIGNATURES AND THEY THEY THEY ALIGN THEIR WORK WITH THOSE INCENTIVES. YOU YOU LOSE THAT LEGITIMACY. WITH THE MEETING OF THE THRESHOLD. I DIE SAID IS TRUE PROBLEM- AND I AND I LIKE POINT OUT THE NINETY TWELVE WHEN HIRAM JOHNSON AND HIS FOLKS GOT THIS PAST. NOBODY WENT TO THE DRY GOOD STORE WITH A CLIPBOARD. AND NOBODY USED DIGITAL MEDIA TO COLLECT MONEY TO PAY PROFESSION SO YOU GOT THIS. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ALIGNED YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THE MODERN WORLD WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE REFORMERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ON.
