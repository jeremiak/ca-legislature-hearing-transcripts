MORE THAN JUST 1100% OF THE

FOLKS IN OPPOSITION.

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:52.850
CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE

00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:54.452

COUNTIES RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:57.955
UNLESS AMENDED AND I DO WANT TO

00:35:58.022 --> 00:35:59.223
POINT OUT FIRST THAT THERE ARE

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:00.725
ACTUALLY SEVERAL PROVISIONS OF

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:01.959
THIS BILL THAT WE SUPPORT AND

00:36:02.026 --> 00:36:03.194
SEE TAX SUPPORTS.

00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:04.829
LOOKING AT THE RENO PROCESS AND

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:06.564
PUTTING SOME GUARDRAILS TO MAKE

00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:07.865
SURE THAT WE'RE ALLOCATING THE

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:09.133
HOUSING PLANNING AND

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.601
REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:12.770
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE JOBS AND

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:14.205
TRANSIT AND OVERCROWDING AND

00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:15.506
UNMET DEMAND.

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:17.141
AND SO WE THINK THE SECTIONS OF

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:19.210
THIS BILL FOR FIVE OR SORRY FIVE

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:21.145
AND SIX BETTER RELATED TO THAT

00:36:21.212 --> 00:36:22.580
PROCESS AND IMPROVING NOT

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:24.482
PROCESS ARE LEGITIMATE AND WE

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:26.083
WOULD BE HAPPY TO REMOVE OUR

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.552
OPPOSITION IF THAT WERE ALL THAT

00:36:27.618 --> 00:36:28.586
THE BILL THAT.

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:30.021
THE PARTS OF THE BILL THAT WE

00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:31.355
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOWEVER

00:36:31.422 --> 00:36:32.957
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:33.824
THE RINA ALLOCATION OR

00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:35.760
ASSESSMENT PROCESS BUT RATHER

00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:37.295
WITH THE HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS

00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:38.629
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

00:36:38.696 --> 00:36:42.066
SO FOR INSTANCE SECTION ONE A

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:44.302
REQUIREMENT THAT IF YOU CAN'T

00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:46.037
HIT ALL OF YOUR ADEQUATE SITES

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:47.605
IN TERMS OF LAND THAT'S ALREADY

00:36:47.672 --> 00:36:49.206
ZONED FOR HOUSING.

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:50.608
IT PUTS FURTHER RESTRICTIONS

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:52.443
BEYOND WHAT'S ALREADY INCLUDED

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.312
IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT LAW ON

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:55.846
WHERE THAT LEE AND THAT CAN BE

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:57.381
DEDICATED FOR HOUSING HOUSE TO

00:36:57.448 --> 00:36:58.382
BE LOCATED.

00:36:58.449 --> 00:36:59.884
SO CURRENTLY THE DEFINITION

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:01.852
THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE BILL IS

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:03.187
LITERALLY UNWORKABLE FOR

00:37:03.254 --> 00:37:04.922
COUNTIES AND WHILE WE'VE BEEN

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:06.223
TALKING TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.259
ABOUT POTENTIALLY INCLUDING

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:09.126
OTHER.

00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:10.928
AND LIMITATIONS ARE PEOPLE ARE

00:37:10.995 --> 00:37:12.663
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT NOT BEING

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.131
ABLE TO MEET THE ADEQUATE SITES

00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:16.133
UNDER THE THRESHOLDS FROM

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.034
THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN LAST YEAR.

00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:18.703
AND THEN BEING PUT IN A BOX IN

00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:20.171
TERMS OF ALSO NOT HAVING ENOUGH

00:37:20.237 --> 00:37:22.873
SITES FOR WHERE THEY CAN REZONE

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:23.608
IT ALSO MEET THESE NEW

00:37:23.674 --> 00:37:25.176
REQUIREMENTS.

00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:26.911
I AM FOR SECTION TWO AND THREE

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.245
WHICH IS THE REQUIREMENT TO ZONE

00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:30.548
FOR A 125% OF YOUR ADEQUATE

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:32.683
SITES AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.919
WITH THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN AND

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:35.753
ONE SIXTY SIX LAST YEAR.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.488
WHICH BOTH ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS

00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:38.589
THIS PROBLEM AND WHICH REALLY

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:39.690
HAVEN'T BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:41.092
BECAUSE FOLKS HAVEN'T DONE THEIR

00:37:41.158 --> 00:37:42.793
FIRST HOUSING ELEMENTS UNDER

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.161
THOSE NEW STANDARDS.

00:37:44.228 --> 00:37:46.163
SO THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN INSURES

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.632
THAT THE SITES THAT ARE INCLUDED

00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:50.067
IN THE INVENTORY ARE THE MOST

00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:52.303
EASILY DEVELOP ALL POLL SITES

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:55.439
AND SO THEY'RE GOOD SITES AN SP

00:37:55.506 --> 00:37:56.173
ONE SIXTY SIX REQUIRES THAT

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.142
THERE ALWAYS BE AN ADEQUATE

00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:00.177
SUPPLY OF SITES. TO MEET YOUR

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:02.413
REMAINING THAT RINA ALLOCATION

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.715
SO WE DID A NEW THRESHOLD THAT

00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:06.217
SAYS THE SITE HAVE TO BE EASY TO

00:38:06.283 --> 00:38:07.918
DEVELOP AND WE ALWAYS HAVE TO

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:09.520
HAVE ENOUGH SITE SO WE THINK

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:11.088
WE'VE ALREADY FIX THIS PROBLEM.

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.723
AS RELATED TO RUNNING OUT OF

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:13.958
ADEQUATE SITES DURING THE

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:15.626
PLANNING PERIOD WITH LAST YEAR'S

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:17.194
LEGISLATION AND WE DON'T THINK

00:38:17.261 --> 00:38:18.462
IT'S APPROPRIATE TO ADD A NEW

00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:21.298
THRESHOLD AND AND REQUIRE --

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:24.168
THAT HUNDRED AND 25% A LEVEL

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:26.037
FINALLY WITH AND SECTION FOUR OF

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:27.271
THE BILL WE ARE A LITTLE BIT

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:28.806
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS LANGUAGE

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:30.307
IT'S KIND OF LIKE STATUTORY

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:31.709
INTENT LANGUAGE.

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:33.277
BUT IT DESCRIBES WHAT RINA

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:35.246
REALLY IS AND SO WE'RE VERY

00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:36.313
CONCERNED WITH STRIKING THE

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.248
LANGUAGE THAT REALLY DOES

00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:39.550
RECOGNIZE THAT DESPITE ALL THE

00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:40.818
BEST EFFORTS OF CITIES AND

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:42.920
COUNTIES SOMETIMES DEVELOPMENT

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:44.455
BECAUSE OF THE MARKET BECAUSE OF

00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:45.389
WHATEVER.

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:46.857
DOESN'T MEET THOSE THRESHOLDS

00:38:46.924 --> 00:38:48.759
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO REVISE

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:50.161
THAT LANGUAGE TO AT LEAST.

00:38:50.227 --> 00:38:51.862
MAINTAINED SOME RECOGNITION OF

00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:53.064
THE FACT THAT THERE'S PARTS OF

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.799
THE MARKET THAT ARE JUST BEYOND

00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:56.801
GOVERNMENT CONTROL AND SO WITH

00:38:56.867 --> 00:38:58.169
THOSE AMENDMENTS WILL BE ABLE TO

00:38:58.235 --> 00:39:00.104
REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION BUT FOR

00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:00.971
NOW WE ARE OPPOSE LET'S AMENDED

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:02.773
THANK YOU.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.709
A GOOD MORNING BILL HIGGINS WITH

00:39:04.775 --> 00:39:05.876
THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:07.745
COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENTS WE HAVE

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:08.813

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:11.982
APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT

HAVE BEEN TAKE AND RIGHT NOW IN

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:16.654
TERMS OF THAT THE STATEWIDE

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:17.922
FACTORS.

00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:18.956
WERE THE THING THAT WE'RE DOING

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.324
RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE CHECKING TO

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:22.727
MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS WITH OUR

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:25.129
SMALLER COGS BECAUSE IT WAS

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:26.564
PROBABLY INFLUENCE WITH YOUR

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.164
WORK WITH ONE OF OUR LARGER

THAT IT WORKS ACROSS THE BOARD.

00:39:31.836 --> 00:39:33.537
BUT THE SECOND THING AND I IS

00:39:33.604 --> 00:39:35.406
THAT WE HAVE THIS COMMITTEE

00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:39.643
PISSED UP PASSED OUT A BILL AB

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.511
SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE BLOOM.

00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:41.746
THAT DEALS WITH SOME OF THE SAME

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:42.947
ISSUES.

00:39:43.013 --> 00:39:44.148
AND WE CAN'T REMOVE OUR

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:46.550
OPPOSITION UNTIL THOSE TWO ARE

00:39:46.617 --> 00:39:48.919
IN SYNC BECAUSE THAT RIGHT NOW

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:50.521
THEY'RE APPROACHING THE SAME

00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:51.155
PROBLEM AND DIFFERENT WAYS AND

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:53.624

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:55.059
THAT.

00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:56.427
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TO BILLS

00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:58.129
AT THE END OF THE THE THING THEN

00:39:58.195 --> 00:39:59.463
THE LAST ISSUE.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.265
IS AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE DO

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:03.134

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:27.892
S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE TARGETS.

00:40:27.958 --> 00:40:28.692
AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.094
SITUATION THAT IF THIS BILL

00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:31.662

TWELVE TWENTY SIX AUTHORED BY

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:12.663
OUR STATE SENATOR PAT BATES

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.965
THANK YOU.

00:47:15.032 --> 00:47:16.767
OTHER CURRENTLY WE ESTIMATE THAT

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:18.335
IN THE CITY OF ENCINITAS THERE

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:19.770
ARE AT LEAST A THOUSAND

00:47:19.836 --> 00:47:20.971
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS THAT

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:22.739
ARE ON PERMITTED.

00:47:22.806 --> 00:47:24.007
BUT ARE A VITAL PART OF OUR

00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:25.642
EXISTING HOUSING STOCK AND WE

00:47:25.709 --> 00:47:26.677
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY

00:47:26.743 --> 00:47:27.945
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALSO IN

00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:29.146
THIS POSITION.

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:30.380
MANY OF THE OWNERS OF THESE

00:47:30.447 --> 00:47:32.382
UNITS LIVE IN THE SHADOWS AND

00:47:32.449 --> 00:47:33.550
THEY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE THAT

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:35.085
THEIR NEIGHBOR COULD TURN THE

00:47:35.152 --> 00:47:36.553
MEN WITH ONE PHONE CALL.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:37.921
BUT THEY'RE ALSO UNABLE TO

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:39.690
PERMIT THE UNIT BASED ON IN

00:47:39.756 --> 00:47:41.258

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.993
HIGH COST.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.361
AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES S. B.

00:47:44.428 --> 00:47:45.662
TOLD TWENTY SIX IS THAT

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:47.497
CLARIFIES THAT A LOCAL BUILDING

00:47:47.564 --> 00:47:49.066
OFFICIAL HAS THE AUTHORITY TO

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:51.001
PERMIT THESE ALREADY OCCUPIED

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:51.969
HOMES.

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:53.237
BASED ON THE BUILDING STANDARD

00:47:53.303 --> 00:47:55.105
THAT WAS IN A FACT WHEN THE UNIT

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:57.140
WAS CONSTRUCTED.

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:58.609
I'VE HEARD FROM RESIDENTS THAT

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:00.277
THEY'RE VERY OLD ACCESSORY UNITS

00:48:00.344 --> 00:48:01.411
SOME OF THEM ARE MORE THAN

00:48:01.478 --> 00:48:02.613
THIRTY YEARS OLD PRE DATING OUR

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:04.114
CITIES AND CORPORATION.

00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:05.582
ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PERMIT

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:07.317
UNDER OUR CURRENT CODES.

00:48:07.384 --> 00:48:08.552
AND SO THEIR ONLY OPTION WOULD

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:09.953
BE REMOVAL OF THIS YEAR THESE

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.089
UNITS WHICH IS NOT IDEAL FOR

00:48:12.155 --> 00:48:14.558
THEM AS THE LANDOWNER OR FOR THE

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:15.425
CITY AND THE STATE AND A HOUSING

00:48:15.492 --> 00:48:17.227
CRISIS.

00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:18.595
SO AS A GOVERNMENT WORK

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:19.663
CONCERNED ABOUT MAINTAINING IN

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.065
CREATING A SAFE HOUSING STOCK.

00:48:22.132 --> 00:48:23.367

WHATEVER WE CAN TO PROVIDE MORE

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:27.337
HOUSING IN OUR CITY NOT LESS.

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:28.705
SO THIS BILL WILL LEAD TO MORE

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:30.474
PERMITTED HOMES AND THEREFORE AN

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.576

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:42.065
AS THEY WERE SAYING --

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:44.034
HAVING THEM ATTENDED TO CODE

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.268
COMPLIANCE VETERAN BASICALLY

00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:47.304
FINANCIALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:48.104
TO CODE AND THEN THE UNIT JUST

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:49.973
COMES OFF THE THE INVENTORY

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:50.707
THINK THAT'S WHAT.

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:53.510
THE THE AUTHOR THAT CITY BATES

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:54.744
TRYING TO DEAL WITH CRAP --

00:51:54.811 --> 00:51:56.279
SO I'D THAT SUBJECTIVITY I THINK

00:51:56.346 --> 00:51:57.414
YOU MAY HAVE SOME JURISDICTIONS

00:51:57.481 --> 00:51:58.348
WITH A BILL IN OFFICIALS WILL

00:51:58.415 --> 00:51:59.416
PROBABLY.

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:00.350
APPROACH WITH MORE CAN DO

00:52:00.417 --> 00:52:02.686
CUSTOMER SERVICE ATTITUDE IN

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:04.754
RIGHT I'M DEPEND ON THEIR THEIR

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.656
VIEW ON EIGHTY IS AYE I THINK

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:09.192
THAT'S THE VALUE OF THIS BILL --

00:52:09.259 --> 00:52:10.427
AND SILLY NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:11.394
IS TO MAKE SURE SOME OF ITS

00:52:11.461 --> 00:52:12.896
HOUSING IS BROUGHT UP FROM

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:13.530
WHATEVER CURRENT STANDARDS THAT

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:14.464
MAY BE.

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:15.665
HOMEOWNER MAY WANNA MAKE AN

00:52:15.732 --> 00:52:16.466
IMPROVEMENT BUT THEY'RE NOT

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:17.567
GOING TO HELP CONVERT PERMITS

00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:19.269
FOR IT IF IT'S ON PERMITTED IN

00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:20.737
THE FIRST PLACE CRACK RIGHT.

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:21.972
SO THAT WE TO THE ONE QUESTION I

00:52:22.038 --> 00:52:24.274
HAD A ONE MAYBE OF AS AS LOOKING

00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:25.108
AT THE BILL --

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:26.877
CONCERN IS THEORETICALLY IF

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:27.911
THERE ARE IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:30.146
BE MADE THAT MAY REQUIRE

00:52:30.213 --> 00:52:30.981
RELOCATION.

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:32.115
OF THE EXISTING TENET AND THE

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:33.083
BILL DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK TO

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:34.451
WHAT HAPPENS THAT TENET IF AND

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:35.852
WHEN THAT HAPPENS I REALIZE THAT

00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:37.320
THAN THAT ADJUSTMENTS COULD BE

00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:38.355
FAIRLY MINOR THAT COULD BE

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:40.357
FAIRLY MAJOR --

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:41.858
IF IF GIVING A A PROPERTY OWNER

00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:43.093
WHO THEORETICALLY MAYBE DIDN'T

00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:44.494
QUITE FOLLOW RULES OF WHEN THIS

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:45.729
WAS CREATED --

00:52:45.795 --> 00:52:47.364
I'M I'M A LITTLE HESITANT ABOUT

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:48.732
PUTTING THAT BURDEN ON THE ON A

00:52:48.798 --> 00:52:50.700
TENANT WHO.

00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:52.335
MAYBE IF THE FED COMFORTABLE

00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:52.903
LIFE -- BUT

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:53.703
MAY SUDDENLY BE DISRUPTED

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:54.538
BECAUSE WE GRANTED THIS

00:52:54.604 --> 00:52:56.106
AUTHORITY CAN YOU SPEAK.

00:52:56.172 --> 00:52:57.207
TO I SENATORS FOR YOU AS THE

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:57.774
AUTHOR --

00:52:57.841 --> 00:52:59.009
WHAT YOUR VIEW IS ON ON WHAT

00:52:59.075 --> 00:53:00.110
SHOULD HAPPEN TO THE TENANTS

00:53:00.176 --> 00:53:01.611
THAT ARE IN THESE UNITS THAT'S

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:02.712
INTERESTING YOU BRING THAT

00:53:02.779 --> 00:53:05.615
FORWARD TO THE SONY MEN ARE

00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:06.182
GLORIA BECAUSE?

00:53:06.249 --> 00:53:07.384
SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN WE

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:08.552
INCORPORATED IN SOUTH ORANGE

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:10.587
COUNTY THE CITY OF LAGUNA BEACH

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:12.222
SOUTH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:13.790
OF THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES.

00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:15.392
WHAT WAS MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS

00:53:15.458 --> 00:53:16.793
SAW CERTAINLY WITH THIS

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.962
PARTICULAR BILL THE FIRE SAFETY

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:20.931
STANDARDS ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE

00:53:20.997 --> 00:53:23.066
TO BE ENFORCED WHATEVER?

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:24.067
YOU KNOW I WE HAVE BEEN IN AN

00:53:24.134 --> 00:53:25.869
INDIVIDUAL YOU THOSE UNITS AT

00:53:25.936 --> 00:53:28.672
THAT TIME THERE WAS A RELOCATION

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:29.339
PROBLEMS.

00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:30.640
FOUND THE CITY ACTUALLY TOOK

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:32.475
THAT ON AND I THINK THAT THAT

00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:34.110
WOULD BE CERTAINLY SOMETHING --

00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:36.646
THAT WOULD LIVE WOULD BE LOOKED

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.081
AT IN A DISCRETIONARY FASHION

00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:40.050
BUT OTHER THAN THAT I NEED TO

00:53:40.116 --> 00:53:41.251
GET ON SO THE CITY RELOCATED

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:43.219
YEAH WELL THEY HAD THE DID HAVE

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:46.690
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OF VOUCHERS --

00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:49.025
FOR YOU KNOW HOTELS Y. AT THAT

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:50.927
TIME AND WE'RE TALKING. TWENTY

00:53:50.994 --> 00:53:52.529
FIVE YEARS AGO I THINK THIRTY

00:53:52.596 --> 00:53:53.930
YEARS AGO --

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:55.298
WHEN ALL THAT HAPPENED AND IT

00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:57.100
WAS SPREE MOB PRETTY MAJOR AT

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:58.101
THAT TIME?

00:53:58.168 --> 00:53:59.469
THAT I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT

00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:00.570
THE CITY WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:02.205
IN TERMS OF HOW MANY AND YOU

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:03.473
KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM WOULD BE

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.774
AN ESPECIALLY WITH SENIORS.

00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:06.676
THAT CAN BE A REAL ISSUE BUT

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:08.078
CHAO SOMETHING THAT I THINK GOES

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:09.279
BACK TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:10.947
DISCRETION AND CERTAINLY THE WAY

00:54:11.014 --> 00:54:11.915
THEY LOOK AT TAKING CARE OF

00:54:11.982 --> 00:54:13.083
THEIR THEIR RESIDENTS.

00:54:13.149 --> 00:54:15.485
WHO MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES IN

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:17.654
THAT DIFFICULT POSITION?

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:18.254
WHY WOULD YOU SAY HE THERE'S

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:19.356
THERE'S VALUE CAN CONVEY TO THE

00:54:19.422 --> 00:54:20.590
PROPERTY ON RIGHT BY THE OUT OF

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.325
BRING SOMETHING INTO COMPLIANCE

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:23.627
MAKE IT LEGAL IMPROVE THEIR

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:24.928
PROPERTY VALUE THEY --

00:54:24.995 --> 00:54:26.863
IT'S ALL UPSIDE FOR THE FOR THE

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:27.631
PROPERTY OWNER.

00:54:27.697 --> 00:54:29.032
I'M OFTEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:31.001
TENANT INVOLVED IN I'D YOU KNOW

00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:31.968
I'M I REALIZE IT'S NOT A

00:54:32.035 --> 00:54:32.602
QUESTION OF MISSILE BEFORE US

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:33.703
TODAY AND CERTAINLY YOUR BILL TO

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.271
DO WITH WHAT YOU AS YOU SEE FIT

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:37.374
PASS MAYBE GONNA GO FOR BASIS TO

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.908
GIVE SOME CONSIDERATION. TO WHAT

00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:40.877
OUGHT TO BE DONE FOR THE TENANTS.

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.345
WHO THEORETICALLY WILL GET NO

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:43.813
UPSIDE TYPICALLY IF HAVE TO BE

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:44.781
RELOCATED AND?

00:54:44.848 --> 00:54:47.183
I'M ANYONE IS OUT ON THAT ON THE

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.953
MIDDLE MARKET RIGHT NOW COULD I

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:50.620
AND IN YOUR QUESTION A LITTLE OR

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:50.920
SO.

00:54:50.987 --> 00:54:52.922
I THINK THE THE MAIN BENEFIT IS

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:54.257
THAT FOR THE TENANTS THAT

00:54:54.324 --> 00:54:55.692
THEY'RE LIVING IN A PLACE THAT'S

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:56.826
ACTUALLY SAFE.

00:54:56.893 --> 00:54:58.094
SO THERE IS A CONCERN THAT

00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:59.429
PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN PLACES THAT

00:54:59.496 --> 00:55:00.797
ARE NOT SAFE AND THEY'RE NOT UP

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:02.298
TO FIRE STANDARDS OR OR OTHER

00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:03.266
STANDARDS.

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:05.201
AND AT LEAST FROM MY EXPERIENCE

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:07.170
OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME IN AND

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:07.671
MEET WITH ME ABOUT THEIR

00:55:07.737 --> 00:55:08.505
CONCERNS.

00:55:08.571 --> 00:55:09.506
THEY'D THEY WOULDN'T BE

00:55:09.572 --> 00:55:11.541
PROACTIVELY KICKING SOMEBODY OUT

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:13.076
TO MAKE THESE IMPROVEMENTS WHAT

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.511
THEY WOULD BE DOING AT THE TIME

00:55:14.577 --> 00:55:15.111
WHEN IT WOULD NATURALLY TURN

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:17.380
OVER WHETHER SOME OTHER TYPE OF

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:18.381
REASON THAT THE TENANT MOVES OUT

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:20.483
ON THEIR OWN.

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:21.084
OR IT INVOLVES A FAMILY MEMBER

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:22.519
MULTI GENERATIONAL AND SO IT'S A

00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:25.155
WAY TO TO TO HELP THAT PROCESS

00:55:25.221 --> 00:55:27.057
MOVE ALONG AND PROVIDE CLARITY

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:28.258
TO THE BUILDING OFFICIAL.

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:29.793
BUT ITS I I DON'T SEE THERE AS

00:55:29.859 --> 00:55:32.362
BEING I'M OF A MAD RUSH TO KICK

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:33.363
OUT PEOPLE GET THESE PERMITS

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.931
COULD I JUST SEE IT AS ANOTHER

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:36.466
OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM BE

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:37.600
PERMITTED BUT I I WOULD BE

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.636
SURPRISED IF WE ACTUALLY SOLVE

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:41.371
THAT PROBLEM.

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:42.172
BUT I I AGREE WITH YOU IT'S A

00:55:42.238 --> 00:55:43.273
CONCERN --

00:55:43.339 --> 00:55:45.008
BUT BUT I I DO I DO THINK THAT

00:55:45.075 --> 00:55:47.043
IT'S IT'S THE HIGHEST GOOD IS

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:48.712
THE SAFETY OF RESIDENTS IN ALL

00:55:48.778 --> 00:55:52.015
OF OUR COMMUNITIES AGREE --

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:53.783
WHAT DE I'VE AND I APPRECIATE

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.652
THAT INPUT ON THAT --

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:57.187
THIS CHAIR I BELIEVE THIS ENJOYS

00:55:57.253 --> 00:55:59.723
DO PASS RECOMMENDATION I'M I'M

00:55:59.789 --> 00:56:01.458
LIVE THAT'S WITH THE RATE THIS

00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:02.092
MOTION MOVE IT AND A SECOND ANY

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:03.526
FURTHER DISCUSSION.

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:04.627
BUT MR GLORIA THINK CAPTURED MY

00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:05.895
OWN PERSPECTIVE ON THIS WHICH IS

00:56:05.962 --> 00:56:07.030
WHILE.

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:09.733
NOT THESE RULES ARE IN THE CODE --

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:12.235
THERE CLEARLY ARE SOME A LACK OF

00:56:12.302 --> 00:56:14.003
CLARITY ARE AS I THINK WE'VE ALL

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:16.372
DISCOVERED AND I ALSO DO NOT SEE

00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:18.208
THE HARM IN IN PUTTING THIS --

00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:21.811
INTO STATUTES OF THAT THERE'S

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:23.313
SPORTS SO --

00:56:23.379 --> 00:56:25.148
THAT'S WHY THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:27.317
RECEIVE MY SUPPORT AND WITH THAT

00:56:27.383 --> 00:56:28.351
ANY FINAL COMMENTS FROM THE

00:56:28.418 --> 00:56:30.053
CENTER RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:30.920
I BILLION APPRECIATE THE

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:31.855
CONVERSATION.

00:56:31.921 --> 00:56:33.356
THINK THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:34.958
POINT THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WHEN

00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:37.227
WE SEE WE HAVE THE RENTAL CRISIS

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:38.828
GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME THAT.

00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:40.630
THINK A WITH A HUMANITARIAN

00:56:40.697 --> 00:56:41.965
APPROACH THAT WE NOW HAVE IN OUR

00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:43.433
CITIES WITH REGARD SOME HOMELESS

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.400
FOR ALL THAT.

00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:45.969
I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:56:46.035 --> 00:56:46.903
SOMETHING CITIES WOULD TAKE

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:49.172
UNDER SERIOUS CONSIDERATION THAT

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:50.440
YOU WOULD WANT TO DISPLAY SOME

00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:52.175
MONEY AND LET'S SAY BANANA UNIT

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:54.043
FOR TWENTY YEARS AND YOU KNOW --

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:56.513
ACTUALLY RENTING OR PERHAPS EVEN

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.348
WHERE THEY HAVE A A RELATIVE SO

00:56:58.414 --> 00:56:59.816
I THINK THAT CAN BE SOLVED ARE

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:00.650
VERY.

00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:02.018
EASILY MAYBE NOT QUICKLY BUT

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:05.355
EASILY I ASK THE COUNCIL'S LOOK

00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:07.056
AT INDIVIDUAL CASES.

00:57:07.123 --> 00:57:08.958
WELL THANK YOU GREAT AND WITHOUT

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:10.326
OF MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL

PURSUANT TO THE LANGUAGE RIGHT

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:17.805
NOW IS IF --

01:26:17.872 --> 01:26:19.974
THROUGH ITS BYLAWS THE

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:20.942
ASSOCIATION I ADDED THIS

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:23.444
LANGUAGE WHEN UNDERSTAND WHY

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.113
THAT'S EVEN NECESSARY AS JUST AN

01:26:25.179 --> 01:26:26.948
UNNEEDED COSTS THAT EVERY

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:28.816
ASSOCIATION FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:26:28.883 --> 01:26:29.617
ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE OF

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:30.919
CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE TO MOVE

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:32.186
FORWARD AND DO.

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:35.590
IN ORDER TO DO A BYLAW AMENDMENT

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:36.391
YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY HAVE THOSE

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:38.660
BY LAW MINUTES DRAFTED MOSTLY BY

01:26:38.726 --> 01:26:40.161
AN ATTORNEY AND THEN ELECTION

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:41.496
HAS TO TAKE PLACE.

01:26:41.563 --> 01:26:42.830
IF IN FACT THESE ARE GOING TO BE

01:26:42.897 --> 01:26:44.432
THE REQUIREMENTS THEN WHY NOT

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:45.700
JUST MAKE THOSE STATUTORY

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:47.435
REQUIREMENTS AND RELIEVE THESE

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:49.070
ASSOCIATIONS OF HAVING TO DO THE

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:50.505
BYLAWS.

01:26:50.572 --> 01:26:52.240
WE HAVE SAID ARE ALL ALONG THAT

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:53.341
WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:55.677
OTHER AREAS OF THAT SHOULD BE

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:57.979
ALLOWED FOR AND THAT ASSOCIATION

01:26:58.046 --> 01:26:59.981
SHOULD HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY. TO

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.616
PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:27:01.683 --> 01:27:03.084
DISQUALIFICATION.

01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:05.954
IN THAT AREA WE WOULD BE OPEN TO

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.889
ALLOWING THAT TO BE DONE BY A

01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:10.391
BYLAW CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S A

01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:11.392
HIGHER BAR THERE'S GREATER

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:13.094
TRANSPARENCY THERE.

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:13.728
THERE ARE ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:16.164
STATE --

01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:17.532
SOME BOARDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:19.667
HAVE THAT SPOUSES CANNOT SERVE

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:21.102
ON THE BOARD AT THE SAME TIME

01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:22.036
THERE'S OTHER CONFLICTS OF

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:23.471
INTEREST THAT MAY OCCUR MAYBE

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:25.406
SOMEONE IS AN ACTIVE LITIGATION

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:27.208
WITH THE ASSOCIATION. TO CREATE

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:28.977
A SIGNIFICANT CONFLICT FOR THEM

01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:30.511
TO BE ON THE BOARD WE THINK

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:32.080
THOSE TYPES OF SITUATION SHOULD

01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:34.048
BE ALLOWED AT A LOCAL LEVEL AND

01:27:34.115 --> 01:27:35.483
THAT THE ASSOCIATION SHOULD BE

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:36.751
ABLE TO DO THOSE.

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:38.252
THROUGH A CHANGE IN THE BYLAWS

01:27:38.319 --> 01:27:41.222
NOT NECESSARILY A RULE.

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:42.690
WE AGREE THAT THE IDEA OUR ISSUE

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:45.893
A NEED TO BE ADDRESSED --

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:46.928
THEY PROVIDE THAT FOR A MEMBER

01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:48.730
IN GOOD STANDING WOULD JUST BE

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:50.632
REGULAR ASSESSMENTS ARE NOTHING

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:52.800
ABOUT SPECIALIST US ASSESSMENTS

01:27:52.867 --> 01:27:54.035
WHICH OCCUR.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.670
HOT THROUGHOUT ASSOCIATIONS ARE

01:27:55.737 --> 01:27:57.505
IN THE STATE.

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:59.374
NOW WRAP UP ON THE WHY WE THINK

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.809
THIS WILL SUPPRESS OUR ACTUAL

01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:03.645
PARTICIPATION IN IN THESE

01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:05.313
ELECTIONS THESE VOTE SIMPLY

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.914
BECAUSE THE WAY THE BILL IS RED

01:28:06.981 --> 01:28:08.816
NOW --

01:28:08.883 --> 01:28:10.485
MEMBERS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:12.520
VOTER REGISTRATION LIST THAT

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:14.522
HAVE ACCESS TO THE BALLOTS THAT

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:15.857
HAVE ACCESS TO THE SIGNED

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:18.092
ENVELOPES BASICALLY HAVE ACCESS

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:19.727
TO EVERY PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:22.096
BE ALLOWED TO COPY THAT.

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:23.798
MOST ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE

01:28:23.865 --> 01:28:25.199
AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT ARE

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:27.802
LESS THAN FIFTY UNITS.

01:28:27.869 --> 01:28:29.671
I THESE ARE SMALL COMMUNITIES IT

01:28:29.737 --> 01:28:30.738
DOES NOT TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF

01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:33.107
EFFORT TO PUT THOSE BALLOTS

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:33.941
TOGETHER.

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.743
WITH ASSIGNED ENVELOPES AND

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:37.011
REALLY START TO CREATE AN

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:39.247
INVASION OF PRIVACY IN FACT

01:28:39.313 --> 01:28:40.481
THERE IS LITIGATION THERE'S

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:41.149
COURT.

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:43.351
CASE OUT THERE THAT HAS HELD

01:28:43.418 --> 01:28:45.386
THAT IN AN OWNER'S INTEREST

01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:47.422
PRIVACY CONSTITUTIONAL INTERESTS

01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:49.290
TO PRIVACY IS ACTUALLY A HIGHER

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:51.459
BAR AND ALLOWING SOMEONE ACCESS

01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:52.493
TO THE COPYING OF THESE THESE

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.029
DOCUMENTS WE THINK AT A MINIMUM.

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:57.498
THAT PASSED TO BE A REMOVED TO

01:28:57.565 --> 01:28:59.634
PROTECT THE PRIVACY INTERESTS A

01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:01.269
OF THESE OWNERS THAT PARTICIPATE

01:29:01.335 --> 01:29:02.670
WITHOUT THAT.

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:03.938
SIMPLY WILL SEE A WHOLE A WHOLE

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:05.807
HOST OF VOTERS.

01:29:05.873 --> 01:29:07.542
NOT PARTICIPATE IN THESE

01:29:07.608 --> 01:29:08.309
ELECTIONS BECAUSE OF THE FEAR

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:09.711
PRIVACY [inaudible]

01:29:09.777 --> 01:29:12.213
WE SUPPORT.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.915
UNBIASED ELECTIONS WE SUPPORT

01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:16.551
CLEAR AND CONCISE RULES ARE

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:17.685
CONCERNED WITH THIS BILL RIGHT

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:19.587
NOW IS IT IS SO CONVOLUTED.

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:21.289
SO COMPLEX IT'S JUST GONNA

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:23.091
RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS

01:29:23.157 --> 01:29:24.792
ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND MORE

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:27.195
LIKELY MORE NON COMPLIANCE A BY

01:29:27.261 --> 01:29:28.463

01:39:11.445 --> 01:39:12.946
THAT'S DON IS OFTENTIMES

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:14.181
DIFFICULT AND DON TEAM AND JUST

01:39:14.248 --> 01:39:15.549
A WHOLE OTHER LANGUAGE NOT TO

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:16.550
MENTION EXPENSIVE.

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:17.951
EXPENSE UPS ARE EIGHTY YOU

01:39:18.018 --> 01:39:19.286
PROGRAM THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING

01:39:19.353 --> 01:39:21.455
INCLUDES WORKSHOPS FOR EDUCATION.

01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:22.823
AS WELL AS WE'RE COMING UP WITH

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:24.491
THE FINANCIAL PROGRAM TO HELP

01:39:24.558 --> 01:39:26.560
PEOPLE GET THROUGH WHAT THE

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:27.961
SENATOR WAS TALKING ABOUT THESE

01:39:28.028 --> 01:39:30.097
PERMIT FEES ARE A HUGE BARRIER

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:31.565
FOR HOMEOWNERS HOMEOWNERS.

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:33.000
STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN THE

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.335
HOMEOWNERS ARE VERY EXCITED TO

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:35.769
BUILD EIGHTY YOU BECAUSE ALL OF

01:39:35.836 --> 01:39:37.004
THESE BENEFITS AND THAT CAN BILL

01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:38.539
WELL FOR THEM.

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:40.074
BUT ONCE THEY GET THROUGH THE

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:40.674
PROCESS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:44.078
PULL HE WOULD YOU BILL --

01:39:44.144 --> 01:39:45.646
OFTENTIMES BE --

01:39:45.713 --> 01:39:47.348
AS HIGH AS 10% OF THE TOTAL

01:39:47.414 --> 01:39:48.749
DEVELOPMENT COST AND SO IT'S A

01:39:48.816 --> 01:39:50.250
HUGE BURDEN NOT JUST

01:39:50.317 --> 01:39:51.552
ECONOMICALLY BUT I THINK ALSO

01:39:51.618 --> 01:39:53.487
PSYCHOLOGICAL --

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:54.355
TO GET THROUGH THIS I THINK

01:39:54.421 --> 01:39:55.756
THERE'S THROUGH OUR PROGRAM

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:56.924
WOULD BE TALKING TO HOMEOWNERS

01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:58.292
WHO WE FOUND MORE AND MORE OFTEN

01:39:58.359 --> 01:39:59.693
THAT WHEN I ASK HOMEOWNER WHY

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.627
THEY WANT TO BUILD.

01:40:00.694 --> 01:40:01.595
THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO BE PART

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:02.963
OF THE SOLUTION SO HERE'S A

01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:04.431
HOMEOWNER THAT MAYBE DOESN'T

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:05.766
HAVE ALL THESE OTHER NEEDS LIKE

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:06.800
OTHER PEOPLE THEY WANT TO BE

01:40:06.867 --> 01:40:08.035
PART OF THE SOLUTION.

01:40:08.102 --> 01:40:09.403
THEY GO DOWN TO THE PLANNING

01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:10.170
DEPARTMENT AND BUILDING AND

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:11.605
SUMMIT AND THEN THEY GET A HUGE

01:40:11.672 --> 01:40:12.706
BELL AND I THINK THAT

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:13.874
PSYCHOLOGICAL.

01:40:13.941 --> 01:40:15.175
PSYCHOLOGICALLY IT BECOMES A

01:40:15.242 --> 01:40:16.944
BARRIER OF LIKELY I'M TRYING TO

01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:18.545
DO SOMETHING GOOD AND YOU'RE

01:40:18.612 --> 01:40:19.413
ACTUALLY DECIDE TO BUY FROM YOU

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.314
FROM DOING THAT LIKE IF THEY

01:40:20.381 --> 01:40:21.582
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S GONNA BE

01:40:21.648 --> 01:40:23.283
CONSTRUCTION COST BUT I THINK A

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:25.452
LOT OF HOMEOWNERS FEEL LIKE I'M.

01:40:25.519 --> 01:40:26.053
THE CITY SHOULD BE SUPPORTING

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.354
THEM -- AND

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:28.355

PUT SOMETHING BACK THERE --

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:39.586
AND THEY USE LIGHT AREA COVERAGE

01:42:39.653 --> 01:42:41.288
AS A WAY TO BLOCK THAT SO I

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:41.522
CANNOT.

01:42:41.588 --> 01:42:44.591

SUPPORT ALL OF THESE PUBLIC

01:49:04.671 --> 01:49:06.573
GOODS THAT WE KNOW PEOPLE NEED

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.707
IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE MOVING

01:49:07.774 --> 01:49:09.009
INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD AND

01:49:09.075 --> 01:49:10.377
INCREASING THE NEED FOR

01:49:10.443 --> 01:49:11.778
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICE SAYS.

01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:13.380
NOT TO MENTION ROADS WHERE WE

01:49:13.446 --> 01:49:14.881
JUST PASSED A BILL LAST YEAR S.

01:49:14.948 --> 01:49:16.283
B. ONE THAT INCLUDES AN

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:25.759
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE VERY

01:49:25.825 --> 01:49:26.493
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FEW

01:49:26.559 --> 01:49:28.561
LIMITATIONS I THINK THERE'S BEEN

01:49:28.628 --> 01:49:30.597
SORT OF A AN IMPRESSION GIVEN

01:49:30.664 --> 01:49:31.698
HERE THAT THESE VIEWS ARE

01:49:31.765 --> 01:49:33.333
ARBITRARILY CREATED AND THAT'S

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:34.367
NOT THE CASE.

01:49:34.434 --> 01:49:36.002
WE HAVE THE MITIGATION FEE ACT

01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:37.704
WHICH REQUIRES THAT THESE FEES

01:49:37.771 --> 01:49:39.639
BE LINKED TO THE ACTUAL IMPACTS

01:49:39.706 --> 01:49:40.974
THAT ARE CREATED --

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:42.442
IF FEES ARE BEING CHARGED RIGHT

01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:44.210
NOW 280- USE THAT ARE NOT

01:49:44.277 --> 01:49:45.578
PROPORTIONATE TO THEIR IMPACTS

01:49:45.645 --> 01:49:46.613
THAT WE SHOULD THROW THE BOOK AT

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.248
THOSE PEOPLE WE SHOULD REQUESTED

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:49.082
JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT

01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:50.250
COMMITTEE AUDIT.

01:49:50.317 --> 01:49:52.252
AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHY THE

01:49:52.319 --> 01:49:54.587
FEES ART AND ACTUALLY

01:49:54.654 --> 01:49:56.323
PROPORTIONATE TO THE SIZE OF THE

01:49:56.389 --> 01:49:57.891
UNIT OR THE NUMBER OF BEDROOMS

01:49:57.958 --> 01:49:59.326
TO THE ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:49:59.392 --> 01:50:00.827
IMPACTS THAT ARE HAPPENING.

01:50:00.894 --> 01:50:01.995
AND SO WE WERE JUST GOING TO

01:50:02.062 --> 01:50:03.730
CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE IN THE LAW

01:50:03.797 --> 01:50:05.598
AND SAY THAT THESE FEES MUST BE

01:50:05.665 --> 01:50:07.367
PROPORTIONATE THAT'S SOMETHING

01:50:07.434 --> 01:50:08.668
WE SHOULD SUPPORT AND IT'S NOT

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:09.669
SOMETHING.

01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:12.172
WHERE AND YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT

01:50:12.238 --> 01:50:14.107
THAT SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING

01:50:14.174 --> 01:50:15.575
UNDER EXISTING LAW EVEN --

01:50:15.642 --> 01:50:17.243
ASIDE FROM THE FEE ISSUE WE DO

01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:19.245
HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT

01:50:19.312 --> 01:50:20.981
SOME HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES

01:50:21.047 --> 01:50:22.315
THAT ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS

01:50:22.382 --> 01:50:23.083
BILL.

01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:24.484
SECTION THREE OF THE BILL IS

01:50:24.551 --> 01:50:26.753
ESSENTIALLY THE EXCEPTION THAT

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:29.723
EIGHT THE ROLE SO WHILE SECTION

01:50:29.789 --> 01:50:30.590
ONE AND THE OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:50:30.657 --> 01:50:31.124
BILL.

01:50:31.191 --> 01:50:33.059
ALLOW US TO PRECLUDE EXCEPT

01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:34.394
THREE DWELLING UNITS BASED ON

01:50:34.461 --> 01:50:35.996
HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS FOR

01:50:36.062 --> 01:50:37.497
INSTANCE WE'VE SEEN SEVERAL

01:50:37.564 --> 01:50:39.499
LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT PRECLUDE

01:50:39.566 --> 01:50:41.267
EIGHTY USE IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD

01:50:41.334 --> 01:50:42.836
SEVERITY ZONES WE'VE SEEN

01:50:42.902 --> 01:50:44.537
SEVERAL LOCAL ORDINANCES LOS

01:50:44.604 --> 01:50:46.239
ANGELES COUNTY FOR INSTANCE JUST

01:50:46.306 --> 01:50:47.273
APPROVED BEARS.

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:49.209
THAT PRECLUDES EIGHTY USE AND

ESPECIALLY IF YOU ALSO HAVE A

FIRE AND THAT'S HAPPENED AND SO

01:50:56.016 --> 01:50:57.050
WE THINK IT'S AGAINST GOOD

01:50:57.117 --> 01:50:59.319
PUBLIC POLICY TO PRECLUDE.

01:50:59.386 --> 01:51:00.987
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM

01:51:01.054 --> 01:51:02.555
LIMITING FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:04.958
REASONS WHERE THOSE TYPES OF

EIGHTY USE LISTED IN SECTION

01:51:06.559 --> 01:51:08.061

BE PLACED.

01:51:08.862 --> 01:51:10.530
SO UNDER SECTION THREE OF THE

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:12.198
BILL WE WOULD HAVE TO ALLOW BY

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.548
AND THERE'S ALSO WE'RE WE'RE NOT

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:30.016
AS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BUT

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:31.851
THERE'S ALSO THE CONVERSION OF

01:51:31.918 --> 01:51:33.019
EXISTING SPACE WITH AND MULTI

01:51:33.086 --> 01:51:34.254
FAMILY DWELLING UNITS.

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.822
SO AT THE VERY LEAST WE NEED TO

01:51:35.889 --> 01:51:37.190
HAVE THE SAME ABILITY TO

01:51:37.257 --> 01:51:39.726
PRECLUDE THOSE BY RIGHT SORT OF

01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:42.195
DEFAULT EIGHTY USE IN SECTION.

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:43.463
THREE THAT WE DO IN THE REST OF

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:44.731
OUR ORDINANCES BECAUSE THE WAY

01:51:44.798 --> 01:51:46.633
IT FUNCTIONS NOW IS IT'S REALLY

01:51:46.699 --> 01:51:48.301
AN EXCEPTION THAT UNDERMINES ALL

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:50.203
THE OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:51.838
INCLUDED IN THE BILL --

01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:55.108
FINALLY I WANT TO SAY THAT. FOR

01:51:55.175 --> 01:51:57.410
APPROVAL AND WE CAN ACCEPT AN

01:51:57.477 --> 01:51:59.479
ACCELERATED TIME FRAME AND I

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:00.547
THINK WE'VE INDICATED TO THIS

01:52:00.613 --> 01:52:02.315
AUTHOR OF NOT IN MY DEFENSE OF

01:52:02.382 --> 01:52:03.083
THE OTHER TWO EIGHTY YUBA

01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:04.050
AUTHORS.

01:52:04.117 --> 01:52:05.218
AND THAT WE COULD ACCEPT A

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:06.619
NINETY DAYTIME FRAME IF IT

01:52:06.686 --> 01:52:08.154
REQUIRES SUBMISSION OF A

01:52:08.221 --> 01:52:09.422
COMPLETE APPLICATION.

01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:10.523
ON AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY

01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:12.492
IMPORTANT IN THIS --

01:52:12.559 --> 01:52:13.726
INSTANCE WHERE THERE'S A DEEMED

01:52:13.793 --> 01:52:15.562
APPROVED REMEDY IN THE BILL AND

01:52:15.628 --> 01:52:16.930
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE

01:52:16.996 --> 01:52:18.198
OPPOSED AS I MENTIONED THE

01:52:18.264 --> 01:52:19.566
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WOULD BE I

01:52:19.632 --> 01:52:20.733
THINK A GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:21.768
DIRECTION.

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:23.303
ON I THINK WE CAN HAVE A BROADER

01:52:23.369 --> 01:52:24.838
CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:52:24.904 --> 01:52:26.806

01:52:26.873 --> 01:52:28.675

01:52:28.741 --> 01:52:30.310
MITIGATION FEE ACT THAT WAS

01:52:30.376 --> 01:52:32.045

LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE.

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:35.482
BUT UNTIL THAT TIME WE THINK

01:52:35.548 --> 01:52:37.450
IT'S PREMATURE AND AGAINST GOOD

01:52:37.517 --> 01:52:39.385
PUBLIC POLICY TO ARBITRARILY

01:52:39.452 --> 01:52:41.554

01:54:29.862 --> 01:54:31.431
LAY OUT A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES

01:54:31.497 --> 01:54:32.498
THAT WE DISCUSSED AND A SENATOR

01:54:32.565 --> 01:54:33.766

01:54:33.833 --> 01:54:35.368
CONVERSATIONS ON THIS.

01:54:35.435 --> 01:54:36.836

HAVE HAD PROBABLY --

01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:42.342
SEVERAL DOZEN POT AND I THINK

01:54:42.408 --> 01:54:44.444
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE

01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:46.179
WON ME OVER ON MANY THE MINUTES

01:54:46.246 --> 01:54:49.649
THAT WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK --

01:54:49.716 --> 01:54:50.984
WITH ONE EXCEPTION AND THAT IS

01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:52.518
THE FEE ISSUE AND I RAISE THAT

01:54:52.585 --> 01:54:54.220
TO SAY THAT I THINK WHERE I AM

01:54:54.287 --> 01:54:55.355
AND WHERE THE SENATOR ARE WE

01:54:55.421 --> 01:54:57.824
AGREE ON 95% OF THIS BILL.

01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:59.592
ARE AND IT'S JUST THAT ONE LAST

01:54:59.659 --> 01:55:01.294
PIECE THAT WE ARE --

01:55:01.361 --> 01:55:02.428
LITTLE BIT STUCK ON AND I'LL

01:55:02.495 --> 01:55:03.696
JUST SAY IN THE STAFF ANNOUNCES

01:55:03.763 --> 01:55:06.366
THIS BILL DOES SIXTEEN THINGS

01:55:06.432 --> 01:55:08.368
AND UP THE ONE ISSUE THAT --

01:55:08.434 --> 01:55:09.936
THAT I KNOW YOU FOCUSED YOUR

01:55:10.003 --> 01:55:11.471
TESTIMONY ON WHICH WAS THAT THE

01:55:11.537 --> 01:55:13.239
FEAR SHE WAS THE ONE THAT WE'RE

01:55:13.306 --> 01:55:14.507
WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH AND I SAY

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:16.209
THAT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT

01:55:16.276 --> 01:55:17.810
THIS BILL DOES A LOT OF THINGS

01:55:17.877 --> 01:55:19.779
WE ARE ASKING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:55:19.846 --> 01:55:20.880
TO DO A LOT OF THINGS AND I

01:55:20.947 --> 01:55:21.447
THINK.

01:55:21.514 --> 01:55:23.116
IT THIS TIME UP WITHOUT FURTHER

01:55:23.182 --> 01:55:25.752
ANALYSIS OUGHT TO SAY THAT --

01:55:25.818 --> 01:55:27.920
WITH THAT WITH JUST THE CAP ON

01:55:27.987 --> 01:55:30.089
SCHOOL FEES AND A WITH THE

01:55:30.156 --> 01:55:31.891
ISSUES WITH RELATED TO UTILITIES

01:55:31.958 --> 01:55:33.860
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CANNOT --

01:55:33.926 --> 01:55:36.796
ASK ANY OTHER FEES.

01:55:36.863 --> 01:55:38.531
I'M I'M NOT COMPLETELY CONVINCED

01:55:38.598 --> 01:55:40.366
THAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS ZERO

01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:41.634
NOW I WILL SAY THAT I AGREE WITH

01:55:41.701 --> 01:55:42.035
YOU.

01:55:42.101 --> 01:55:43.236
THAT THERE DO APPEAR TO BE

01:55:43.303 --> 01:55:44.237
JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE FEES ARE

01:55:44.304 --> 01:55:46.539
TOO HIGH --

01:55:46.606 --> 01:55:49.108
BUT THAT IS WHY LAST YEAR AS

01:55:49.175 --> 01:55:51.244
PART OF THE HOUSING PACKAGE WE

01:55:51.311 --> 01:55:53.780
SUPPORTED AB EIGHT SEVENTY NINE

01:55:53.846 --> 01:55:55.481
WHICH WILL REQUIRE A STUDY OF

01:55:55.548 --> 01:55:57.216
THE IMPACT FEES TO COME BACK. TO

01:55:57.283 --> 01:55:58.584
THIS LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE CAN

01:55:58.651 --> 01:55:59.986
RESOLVE THESE ISSUES I THINK WE

01:56:00.053 --> 01:56:02.288
WILL LIKELY HAVE A VERY ROBUST

01:56:02.355 --> 01:56:04.457
CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR ABOUT ALL

01:56:04.524 --> 01:56:06.059
HOUSING IMPACT FEES AND I'M JUST

01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:06.759
WORRIED.

01:56:06.826 --> 01:56:08.428
THAT DEALING WITH THIS AND AND

01:56:08.494 --> 01:56:11.197
IN A IN SUCH A BIFURCATED WAY

01:56:11.264 --> 01:56:14.200
FULL ANALYSIS.

01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:15.802
I THINK IT'S A BIT PREMATURE OUT

01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:17.570
ALSO SAY THIS COMMITTEE --

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:19.472
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO WE HAD

01:56:19.539 --> 01:56:21.908
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAMS BILL WHICH

01:56:21.974 --> 01:56:23.643
YOU KNOW IS A BILL THAT IS A

01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:24.844
COMPANION BILL TO THIS.

01:56:24.911 --> 01:56:26.612
ONE AYE AND WE HAD ASKED HIM TO

01:56:26.679 --> 01:56:27.980
TAKE THOSE.

01:56:28.047 --> 01:56:29.949
A REQUIREMENTS OUT AND THAT IS

01:56:30.016 --> 01:56:30.750
SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE

01:56:30.817 --> 01:56:31.250
DID.

01:56:31.317 --> 01:56:32.018
AND SO I THINK OUT OF

01:56:32.085 --> 01:56:33.786
CONSISTENCY WOULD MAKE SENSE TO

01:56:33.853 --> 01:56:35.388
DO THAT THAT BEEN SAID YOU KNOW

01:56:35.455 --> 01:56:36.789
YOU WE JUST WE'VE DISCUSSED OF

01:56:36.856 --> 01:56:38.358
THE LAST FEW DAYS SOME WAY TO

01:56:38.424 --> 01:56:39.258
TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:56:39.325 --> 01:56:40.426
PROPORTIONALITY FEES WOULD LOOK

01:56:40.493 --> 01:56:41.994
LIKE WE JUST HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE

01:56:42.061 --> 01:56:43.529
TO COME UP WITH LANGUAGE --

01:56:43.596 --> 01:56:45.331
I'M OPEN TO CONTINUE THAT

01:56:45.398 --> 01:56:47.100
CONVERSATION THROUGH THE PROCESS --

01:56:47.166 --> 01:56:48.601
IN IN THE COMING WEEKS IF WERE

01:56:48.668 --> 01:56:50.303
ABLE TO GET THERE A BUT I THINK

01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:51.871
AT THIS TIME THE IDEA OF JUST

01:56:51.938 --> 01:56:54.574
SIMPLY TAKING ALL THE FEES OUT --

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:55.942
GIVEN ALL THE THINGS THAT THIS

01:56:56.008 --> 01:56:57.910
BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS A LITTLE

01:56:57.977 --> 01:56:59.245
PREMATURE AND I WILL JUST SAY

01:56:59.312 --> 01:57:00.913
JUST TO SUMMARIZE.

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:02.382
THIS BILL IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:57:02.448 --> 01:57:04.050
ANALYSIS IT REQUIRES LOCAL

01:57:04.117 --> 01:57:05.251
AGENCIES TO POTENTIALLY

01:57:05.318 --> 01:57:06.853
DESIGNATE AREAS WERE EIGHTY USE

01:57:08.054 --> 01:57:09.355
SAFETY REASONS.

01:57:09.422 --> 01:57:10.623
SAYS AT LOCAL AGENCIES CAN'T

01:57:10.690 --> 01:57:11.958
ESTABLISH STANDARDS AROUND

01:57:12.024 --> 01:57:13.726
MINIMUM LOT SIZES --

01:57:13.793 --> 01:57:15.061

SETBACKS GARAGES CARPORTS NAM

01:57:21.868 --> 01:57:24.437
APPLICATION TIME FRAMES --

01:57:24.504 --> 01:57:25.738
I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT WHAT

01:57:25.805 --> 01:57:26.906
THIS BILL DOES AND WHAT THIS

01:57:26.973 --> 01:57:28.908
BILL IS GOING TO DO IS IT LAYERS

01:57:28.975 --> 01:57:30.977
MANY ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON

01:57:31.043 --> 01:57:31.711
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHICH I

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:32.412
SUPPORT.

01:57:32.478 --> 01:57:34.313
BUT AGAIN THE IDEA OF SAYING

01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:34.881
WE'RE GONNA LAYER ALL THESE

01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:36.349
REQUIREMENTS --

01:57:36.416 --> 01:57:37.917
BUT SAY THAT LOCALS ARE UNABLE

01:57:37.984 --> 01:57:39.852
TO RECOUP ANY OF IT THAT'S

01:57:39.919 --> 01:57:40.653
WHAT'S GIVING ME A LITTLE BIT

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:42.622
HARPER SO ODD RABBIT YOU KNOW

01:57:42.688 --> 01:57:43.623
HAVING DISCUSSION YOU KNOW I'VE

01:57:43.689 --> 01:57:44.857
HAD A COUPLE TIMES BUT I JUST

01:57:44.924 --> 01:57:46.025
WANTED TO SAY ALL THAT.

01:57:46.092 --> 01:57:49.162
LET ME TRY TO NARROW THE THE

01:57:49.228 --> 01:57:51.531
WINDOW THAT THAT THAT I THINK

01:57:51.597 --> 01:57:52.865
THE ADVOCATE WHO IS REFLECTIVE

01:57:52.932 --> 01:57:54.333
THE ADVOCATES IN IN THE SPIRIT

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:57.236
OF AB EIGHT SEVENTY NINE BECAUSE

01:57:57.303 --> 01:57:57.870
THAT'S NOT GONNA COME BACK TO US

01:57:57.937 --> 01:57:58.438
NEXT.

01:57:58.504 --> 01:58:00.239
NEXT YEAR AND PROBABLY NOT COULD

01:58:00.306 --> 01:58:02.875
HAVE REGULATIONS TILL TWENTY

01:58:02.942 --> 01:58:03.476
TWENTY ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE

01:58:03.543 --> 01:58:05.645
THAT IF IT IF IT IF IF THEY COME

01:58:05.711 --> 01:58:07.947
BACK WITH RECOMMENDATIONS SO WE

01:58:08.014 --> 01:58:09.549
BRAG BECAUSE THAT'S THAT THE THE

01:58:09.615 --> 01:58:11.317
THE STUDY SUPPOSED TO COME BACK

01:58:11.384 --> 01:58:13.052
NEXT YEAR SO WE COULD ACTUALLY.

01:58:13.119 --> 01:58:14.020
LA WE COULD ACTUALLY TAKE MAKE

01:58:14.086 --> 01:58:17.824
DECISION.

01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:21.093
OKAY EXACT I'M HOPING TO ALL TO

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.295
SAY THAT FOR EVERYONE WHO.

01:58:22.361 --> 01:58:23.329
NOW THERE'S A MOVE HOPE THAT WE

01:58:23.396 --> 01:58:25.198
DON'T BUT SO THE POINT OF ASKING

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:26.732
THE STUDY TO COME BACK NEXT YEAR

01:58:26.799 --> 01:58:27.700
TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY

01:58:27.767 --> 01:58:29.368
HERE'S MY CONCERN IN THE MATCH --

01:58:29.435 --> 01:58:30.703
WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT

01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:32.538
THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:58:32.605 --> 01:58:33.940
AND PERMITTED UNITS ARE NOT

01:58:34.006 --> 01:58:35.041
THERE'S STILL A WHOLE HECK OF A

01:58:35.107 --> 01:58:36.776
LOT OF FUN PER MINUTE YOU.

01:58:36.843 --> 01:58:38.845
AND AND AND THERE'S NO REASON TO

01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:40.480
HAVE AN AMNESTY PROGRAM IF THEY

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:42.482
HAVE TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR THE

01:58:42.548 --> 01:58:43.716
PERMITS THAT THEY HAVE THEY'RE

01:58:43.783 --> 01:58:45.418
NOT PAYING PROPERTY TAXES AND

01:58:45.485 --> 01:58:46.853
THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT

01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:49.355
INCLUDED IN THE COUNT THAT WE

01:58:49.422 --> 01:58:50.690
THAT OUR HOUSING ELEMENTS AND

01:58:50.756 --> 01:58:51.491
EVERYTHING HAS.

01:58:51.557 --> 01:58:55.194
SO IF WE'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE A

01:58:55.261 --> 01:58:57.864
HAVE THE THE WAIVER OF THE FEES

01:58:57.930 --> 01:59:00.299
UNTIL WE TAKE SUCH ACTION AND

01:59:00.366 --> 01:59:02.001
THEN THAT WOULD BE WITH THE

01:59:02.068 --> 01:59:03.636
RESULT OF AB.

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:04.737
SEVEN NINE A EIGHT SEVEN NINE

01:59:04.804 --> 01:59:05.972
AND THERE'S A THERE'S A

01:59:06.038 --> 01:59:07.673
CONSENSUS IN LEGISLATION THAT

01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:08.941
THE GOVERNOR --

01:59:09.008 --> 01:59:10.376
SIGNS THEM WHAT WE WILL BE DOING

01:59:10.443 --> 01:59:12.812
IS IS IS WILL HAVE A YEAR OR

01:59:12.879 --> 01:59:14.113
EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR TWO YEARS

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:15.615
THAT THERE WOULD BE THIS WINDOW

01:59:15.681 --> 01:59:18.084
SO THAT ALL THE BOOTLEG UNITS

01:59:18.150 --> 01:59:19.619
WOULD KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO GO

01:59:19.685 --> 01:59:20.887
NOW.

01:59:20.953 --> 01:59:22.455
OR THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE

01:59:22.522 --> 01:59:22.655
THAT.

01:59:22.722 --> 01:59:25.391
AT CPAP PAY THE FEE ADDITIONALLY

01:59:25.458 --> 01:59:28.194
ALL BE ABLE TO SHOW AT THAT TIME

01:59:28.261 --> 01:59:29.896
HOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE

01:59:29.962 --> 01:59:32.031
COME ONLINE AND ARE PAYING THE

01:59:32.098 --> 01:59:32.932
PROPERTY TAXES.

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:34.867
BECAUSE YOU KNOW AGAIN THESE WE

01:59:34.934 --> 01:59:36.736
WEEK CONVENIENTLY FORGET THE

01:59:36.802 --> 01:59:39.205
FIRST WORD OF THE THE FEES WERE

01:59:39.272 --> 01:59:41.007
TALKING ABOUT IS DEVELOPER

01:59:41.073 --> 01:59:43.042
IMPACT FEES.

01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:44.744
THE SERVER HOMEOWNERS THEIR PAIN

01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:46.279
THE IMPACT FEES THEY'RE TREATING

01:59:46.345 --> 01:59:47.680
THEM THE ALL OF THEM ARE

01:59:47.747 --> 01:59:48.681
TREATING THEM LIKE THEY'RE

01:59:48.748 --> 01:59:49.515
DEVELOPERS BUT THEY'RE NOT

01:59:49.582 --> 01:59:50.983
DEVELOPERS HERE'S THEIR OUR

01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:52.552
NEIGHBORS OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT

01:59:52.618 --> 01:59:53.853
ARE PUTTING IN A SECOND UNIT.

01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:55.922
THEY'RE NOT A DEVELOPER IMPACT

01:59:55.988 --> 01:59:58.491
FEE SO IN THAT SPIRIT I GET IT

01:59:58.558 --> 01:59:59.959
WHEN YOU COME IN YOUR EACH WEEK

02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:01.294
CAN BE HOMES THAT'S A WHOLE

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.361
DIFFERENT THING BUT BUT WE'VE

02:00:02.428 --> 02:00:03.829
ALLOWED THE SCHOOLS AND THE

02:00:03.896 --> 02:00:04.597
COUNTIES.

02:00:04.664 --> 02:00:05.631
AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO TREAT

02:00:05.698 --> 02:00:07.900
THESE.

02:00:07.967 --> 02:00:09.502
AS THOUGH THEIR DEVELOPERS AND

02:00:09.569 --> 02:00:10.736
WE'VE HEARD IT INSTEAD AND

02:00:10.803 --> 02:00:12.071
PREVIOUS SO.

02:00:12.138 --> 02:00:14.941
I KNOW THAT THAT IS A BIG LEAP

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:17.176
FOR ME TOOK A TO TAKE BUT BUT

02:00:17.243 --> 02:00:18.611
I'D AT LEAST.

02:00:18.678 --> 02:00:21.180
MAYBE ALL BE WRONG AND WILL HAVE

02:00:21.247 --> 02:00:22.915
THIS WINDOW OF TIME WHATEVER IT

02:00:22.982 --> 02:00:24.784
IS TO TAKE TO IT THESE

02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:26.152
RECOMMENDATIONS ANYTHING FEES

02:00:26.218 --> 02:00:28.087
I'M WILLING.

02:00:28.154 --> 02:00:29.989
TO FALL ON THE SWORD AND SAY

02:00:30.056 --> 02:00:33.159
I'VE I FEEL SO --

02:00:33.225 --> 02:00:35.394
DRIVEN THAT I NEED I NEED TO

02:00:35.461 --> 02:00:36.829
SHOW THAT THESE FOLKS CAN COME

02:00:36.896 --> 02:00:38.431
OUT AND WE CAN ACTUALLY.

02:00:38.497 --> 02:00:40.499
ADDRESS THE HOUSING ISSUES THAT

02:00:40.566 --> 02:00:41.701
THAT ALL LIVE WITH EVERITT

02:00:41.767 --> 02:00:43.636
WHATEVER THE AT EACH CD COMES

02:00:43.703 --> 02:00:45.171
OUT ON WHAT THEY BELIEVE WILL BE

02:00:45.237 --> 02:00:47.873
THE IMPACT THE IMPACT FEES ON

02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:48.874
EIGHTY USE THAT WOULD BE THAT

02:00:48.941 --> 02:00:50.209
BECOME THE STATE LAW WHATEVER

02:00:50.276 --> 02:00:51.210
THAT NUMBER IS.

02:00:51.277 --> 02:00:53.713
AND GIVE ME A SMALL WINDOW OF

02:00:53.779 --> 02:00:56.882
TIME TO TO SEE IF WE CAN GET

02:00:56.949 --> 02:00:58.751
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE UNDER THE

02:00:58.818 --> 02:00:59.318
AMNESTY PROGRAM.

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:03.956
A COME FORWARD INTO LEGITIMATELY

PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMUNITY THE

02:01:05.391 --> 02:01:08.260
COMMUNITIES THAT'S I I THINK

02:01:08.327 --> 02:01:09.495
THAT THAT'S THAT THAT'S FAIR

02:01:09.562 --> 02:01:11.897
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BARRIER

02:01:11.964 --> 02:01:13.633
THAT'S OUT THERE AND I REALLY I

02:01:13.699 --> 02:01:15.701
UNDERSTAND THE CHAIR AND AND THE

02:01:15.768 --> 02:01:17.269
COUNTIES IN EVERYBODY'S.

02:01:17.336 --> 02:01:19.138
INTERESTED IN HAVING MORE

02:01:19.205 --> 02:01:22.541
HOUSING A A UP THERE IN THE ACT

02:01:22.608 --> 02:01:23.309
BY.

02:01:23.376 --> 02:01:24.377
I DO THAT WITH THE GREATEST

02:01:24.443 --> 02:01:25.478
RESPECT FOR THE CHAIR IN THE

02:01:25.544 --> 02:01:26.712
GREATEST RESPECT FOR THE WORK

02:01:26.779 --> 02:01:27.713
THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE FOR

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:30.316
THIS SMALL WINDOW UNTIL THEY

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:31.784
MAKE THEIR DECISION AND WE THE

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:33.352
GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW WHAT

02:01:33.419 --> 02:01:34.553
THE NEW FEES ARE GOING TO BE FOR

02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:35.855
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS WHICH I

02:01:35.921 --> 02:01:36.055
THINK.

02:01:36.122 --> 02:01:38.157
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR.

02:01:38.224 --> 02:01:39.725
SO WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAYING

02:01:39.792 --> 02:01:41.961
IS THE POTENTIAL SMALL WINDOW

02:01:42.028 --> 02:01:43.129
THAT THAT'S NOT AN IDEA THAT.

02:01:43.195 --> 02:01:45.831
I I KNOW WE HAD DISCUSSED THAT

02:01:45.898 --> 02:01:47.433
SO I GUESS I WOULD LIKE ON IT.

02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:49.001
I SLEPT ON A COUCH AND WE DID

02:01:49.068 --> 02:01:50.102
HAVE A CHANCE RIGHT WE DON'T

02:01:50.169 --> 02:01:51.270
JUST TALK THIS MORNING ELIMINATE

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:52.905
LET ME LET ME SAY A FEW THINGS

02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:54.106
AND RESPONSE --

02:01:54.173 --> 02:01:55.675
I KNOW YOU CHARACTERIZE THIS AS

02:01:55.741 --> 02:01:57.910
HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE ARE TRYING TO

02:01:57.977 --> 02:01:58.911
BUILD EXTRA HOME THAT IS THE

02:01:58.978 --> 02:02:00.312
CASE WITH WITH MOST.

02:02:00.379 --> 02:02:02.081
OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT

02:02:02.148 --> 02:02:03.649
WE ARE NOT ASKING YOU TO TAKE

02:02:03.716 --> 02:02:05.117
THE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE

02:02:05.184 --> 02:02:07.153
REQUIRED AN OWNER OCCUPIED.

02:02:07.219 --> 02:02:10.990
REQUIREMENT WHICH DOES ME

02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:11.290
[inaudible]

02:02:11.357 --> 02:02:13.492
MANY MANY.

02:02:13.559 --> 02:02:16.095
MANY MANY AND LAW UNITS I IN

02:02:16.162 --> 02:02:18.197
WE'RE NOT ASKING FEE.

02:02:18.264 --> 02:02:19.331
THERE ARE THAT FEELS A LITTLE

02:02:19.398 --> 02:02:20.900
BIT -- FEELS

02:02:20.966 --> 02:02:22.735
A LITTLE BIT STRANGE WE ALSO

02:02:22.802 --> 02:02:23.335
KNOW IT WAS ALIVE.

02:02:23.402 --> 02:02:24.470
WE ALSO KNOW AT THIS TIME THERE

02:02:24.537 --> 02:02:26.639
ARE CITIES THAT HAVE CHOSEN

02:02:26.706 --> 02:02:27.673
BECAUSE THEY'VE MADE THE

02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:29.108
CALCULATION LIKE THE CITY OF SAN

02:02:29.175 --> 02:02:29.842
DIEGO.

02:02:29.909 --> 02:02:31.777
OUGHT TO OUGHT TO WEIGH FEES TO

02:02:31.844 --> 02:02:34.714
HAVE AN AMNESTY AND I THINK THAT

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:36.082
IF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

02:02:36.148 --> 02:02:37.850
ARE DECIDED THAT THAT WAS THE

02:02:37.917 --> 02:02:39.351
RIGHT POLICY BECAUSE THEY WOULD

02:02:39.418 --> 02:02:39.952
EXPECT TO SEE MORE IN PROPERTY

02:02:40.019 --> 02:02:41.620
TAXES.

02:02:41.687 --> 02:02:43.122
ARE THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND DO IT

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:44.590
THERE'S NOTHING THAT PREVENTS A

02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:45.758
LOCAL CITY.

02:02:45.825 --> 02:02:47.126
A CITY FROM FROM MOVING FOR

02:02:47.193 --> 02:02:48.561
DOING THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:02:48.627 --> 02:02:50.162
RIGHT NOW THOUGH IS THAT THIS IS

02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:51.597
A ONE SIZE FITS ALL LET'S.

02:02:51.664 --> 02:02:53.099
ELIMINATE ALL FEES FOR ALL

02:02:53.165 --> 02:02:54.333
JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE TWO

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:56.402
CATEGORIES THAT YOU ENUMERATED

02:02:56.469 --> 02:02:57.670
IN AGAIN FOR THAT'S WHAT WINDOW

02:02:57.737 --> 02:02:59.338
FOR A SMALL WINDOW OF TIME.

02:02:59.405 --> 02:03:02.241
UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE ACCENT

02:03:02.308 --> 02:03:04.610
EACH ARE A CD.

02:03:04.677 --> 02:03:06.746
ROD RECOMMENDATIONS SO THAT IT

02:03:06.812 --> 02:03:07.713
WOULD BE TIME WHAT IS TIME

02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:09.248
SENSITIVE WE WOULD PUT AMEND

02:03:09.315 --> 02:03:10.616
THIS BILL SO THAT WHEN THAT

02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:13.919
BECAME THE LAW WE WOULD PUT IT

02:03:13.986 --> 02:03:14.086
IN.

02:03:14.153 --> 02:03:15.888
AND AND AGAIN WE IT RATHER THAN

02:03:15.955 --> 02:03:18.557
FOCUS ON THAT THE FAIR CITIES

02:03:18.624 --> 02:03:20.292
HAVE A FEE THAT THAT THAT SEEMS

02:03:20.359 --> 02:03:21.694
TO BE AT ANOTHER THEY'RE

02:03:21.761 --> 02:03:23.195
ACTUALLY TRYING TO WORK WITH ME

02:03:23.262 --> 02:03:24.263
AND WORK WITH THE ADVOCATES

02:03:24.330 --> 02:03:25.731
THERE A LOT OF CITIES THAT ARE

02:03:25.798 --> 02:03:26.499
USED IN THE FEES.

02:03:26.565 --> 02:03:28.400
SIMPLY AS A WAY TO DISCOURAGE

02:03:28.467 --> 02:03:30.436
THE EIGHT ACT EIGHTY USE WE WE

02:03:30.503 --> 02:03:33.072
KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A HISTORY --

02:03:33.139 --> 02:03:34.039
THROUGHOUT THE LAST FIFTEEN

02:03:34.106 --> 02:03:36.809

PREPARED TO TO WORK WITH YOU

DURING THIS PROCESS AFTER IF

02:04:26.292 --> 02:04:27.593
THIS BILL GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE.

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:29.428
OUGHT TO THINK OF WHAT THE

02:04:29.495 --> 02:04:31.764
PROPORTIONAL --

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:33.799
SUGGESTION MIGHT BE AND HOW TO

02:04:33.866 --> 02:04:35.167
HANDLE THESE FEES ARE BUT I JUST

02:04:35.234 --> 02:04:36.569
THINK AT THIS POINT I IT'S THE

02:04:36.635 --> 02:04:37.736
LITTLE BIT TO TO WORK THIS OUT

02:04:37.803 --> 02:04:39.271
ON THE FLY WITH WHAT I THINK

WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS A

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:41.707
DEADLINE OF WHEN.

02:04:41.774 --> 02:04:43.342
ANOTHER BILL MIGHT ESET THESE

02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:45.845
FEES SO WILL PASS WILL HAVE A

02:04:45.911 --> 02:04:47.379
WAIVER UNTIL ANOTHER BILL COMES

02:04:47.446 --> 02:04:48.848
ALONG THAT WOULD.

02:04:48.914 --> 02:04:50.516
THAT WOULD WOULD RESET FEES AND

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:52.218
I I THINK IT'S BETTER TO JUST

02:04:52.284 --> 02:04:54.019
HAVE THE CONVERSATION AT ONCE

02:04:54.086 --> 02:04:55.521
AND WE DECIDE WHAT WE'RE GOING

02:04:55.588 --> 02:04:56.989
TO DO MOVING FORWARD SO THAT'S

02:04:57.056 --> 02:04:58.524
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK.

02:04:58.591 --> 02:04:59.425

WE CAN ADDRESS.

02:05:11.704 --> 02:05:12.605
BUT LET'S HAVE ADDITIONAL

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:14.340
DISCUSSION MISTER GLORIA.

STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

02:05:27.453 --> 02:05:29.955
AND I FEEL THIS WAY BECAUSE MY

02:05:30.022 --> 02:05:30.556
CITY CANNOT SOLVE THE STATE'S

02:05:30.623 --> 02:05:31.490

02:05:36.428 --> 02:05:37.429
IN MY SEE THAT IS NO WAY GOING

02:05:37.496 --> 02:05:40.833
TO SOLVE THE POWER.

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:43.135

COUNCIL ACTION IT'S AS WELL AS I

02:06:04.924 --> 02:06:06.792
THINK. EIGHT THOUSAND POINT IS

02:06:06.859 --> 02:06:08.460
IS IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE I'VE

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:09.528
HEARD FROM CONSTITUENTS WHO

02:06:09.595 --> 02:06:10.729
DON'T KNOW WHO BOB WHITE HOUSE

02:06:10.796 --> 02:06:12.298

DO THIS --

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:19.004
AND SO IT'S VERY ODD OR UNUSUAL

02:06:19.071 --> 02:06:20.372
TO HAVE ORGANIC UNPROMPTED

02:06:20.439 --> 02:06:21.774

02:06:23.642 --> 02:06:24.510
ONE OF THEM.

02:06:24.576 --> 02:06:25.778
I WHEN I HEARD OF YOUR BILL I

02:06:25.844 --> 02:06:27.579
THINK IT'S WORTHWHILE TO TO MOVE

02:06:27.646 --> 02:06:28.681
THIS DIRECTION I SHARE THESE

02:06:28.747 --> 02:06:30.749
FEELINGS WITH THE CHAIR --

I KNOW IT'S THAT.

02:06:37.089 --> 02:06:39.124
A CRITICAL TO GO NO GO ON IF YOU

02:06:39.191 --> 02:06:40.192
BELIEVE AS I DO THAT THE BIGGEST

02:06:40.259 --> 02:06:41.560
PROBLEM FACING THE STATE IS OUR

02:06:41.627 --> 02:06:43.095
HOUSING CRISIS THEN WE NEED TO

02:06:43.162 --> 02:06:44.530
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

02:06:44.596 --> 02:06:45.864
I'M I HEARD THAT THE SENATOR'S

02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:47.232

02:09:27.159 --> 02:09:28.060
BUT I'M JUST NOT CERTAIN RIGHT

02:09:28.127 --> 02:09:29.261
NOW IF IT NEEDS TO BE REDUCED

02:09:29.328 --> 02:09:31.029

02:09:33.999 --> 02:09:35.834
AN AMNESTY MAKES SENSE CAN GO

02:09:35.901 --> 02:09:37.336
FORWARD AND DO IT AND AND THAT'S

02:09:37.402 --> 02:09:38.504
WHAT SAN DIEGO HAS DONE.

02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:40.038
AND AND I ENCOURAGE OTHER CITIES

02:09:40.105 --> 02:09:41.306
IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO THAT THAT

02:09:41.373 --> 02:09:43.242
IS SOMETHING THEY CAN DO.

02:09:43.308 --> 02:09:43.842
AS WELL BUT JUST TO HAVE THE

02:09:43.909 --> 02:09:46.478

02:10:29.154 --> 02:10:30.556
THAT THE CITY COULD HAVE ON THE

02:10:30.622 --> 02:10:32.024

WE WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

02:10:50.309 --> 02:10:52.244
DISCERN WHERE THE THREE THOUSAND

02:10:52.311 --> 02:10:53.212
ALL FLIGHT WAS TEMPERATURES.

02:10:53.278 --> 02:10:54.780

THIS CENTURY WHAT'S IT BASED ON

02:10:59.451 --> 02:11:01.453
I THINK IT IN THE LOCAL AREA HE

02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:03.355
HAD -- NO

02:11:03.422 --> 02:11:03.956

02:11:12.197 --> 02:11:12.864
THAT WE'RE HAVING OF AT SCHOOL

02:11:12.931 --> 02:11:14.933

THEY CAN HAVE AN IMPACT HE SAID

02:11:20.305 --> 02:11:21.006
THAT'S LIMITED.

02:11:21.073 --> 02:11:22.307
AND MOST THAT THE GARAGE

02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:24.843
CONVERSIONS ARE BETWEEN FOUR

02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:26.878

THE GARAGE CONVERSION SO.

02:11:31.283 --> 02:11:33.185
RATHER THAN PALM.

02:11:33.252 --> 02:11:35.787
QUIBBLE I I TOOK THE AMENDMENT

02:11:35.854 --> 02:11:37.556
IT WAS ASKED UPON ME I THOUGHT

02:11:37.623 --> 02:11:39.191
WHEN I WAS IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH

THAT I DON'T.

02:11:46.898 --> 02:11:47.733
KNOW THAT IT'S SCIENTIFICALLY

02:11:47.799 --> 02:11:49.835
DRAWN I CHAIR.

02:11:49.901 --> 02:11:50.702
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

02:11:50.769 --> 02:11:53.205
FIGURE OUT HOW SCIENCE FAX

02:11:53.272 --> 02:11:53.505
[inaudible]

02:11:53.572 --> 02:11:58.110
THE I DATA.

02:11:58.176 --> 02:11:58.844
THERE WAS ANOTHER QUESTION I

02:11:58.910 --> 02:12:00.846

ANY OTHER DISK FOLLOW UP

QUESTION IS THAT DIE IF --

02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:08.520
LEADS THIS HONUS AMNESTY PERIOD

02:12:08.587 --> 02:12:11.089
THAT DIDN'T GIVE WHEN --

02:12:11.156 --> 02:12:12.090
THAT SO THAT MEANS SAID THERE'LL

02:12:12.157 --> 02:12:14.526
BE NO PENALTY FOR NOT HAVING.

02:12:14.593 --> 02:12:16.328
REGISTERED DAHLE PAY CORRECTIVE

02:12:16.395 --> 02:12:18.430
MEAN MY IN WHAT I ENVISIONED

02:12:18.497 --> 02:12:19.998
UNDER THE AMNESTY PROGRAM IS

02:12:20.065 --> 02:12:21.967
THAT THAT YOU WOULD FIRST YOU

02:12:22.034 --> 02:12:22.634
HAVE TO PAY FOR THE INSPECTOR TO

02:12:22.701 --> 02:12:23.535
COME OUT.

02:12:23.602 --> 02:12:24.703
AND SECOND YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR

02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:26.138
YOUR PERMIT FEE THAT'S THAT

02:12:26.204 --> 02:12:27.906
THAT'S THAT'S NINE THIS

02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:29.474
DISPUTABLE YOU COME IN THERE AND

02:12:29.541 --> 02:12:32.544
THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR WHAT.

02:12:32.611 --> 02:12:33.879
WHATEVER THEY SAY HAS BEGUN TO

02:12:33.945 --> 02:12:35.681
MAKE IT.

02:12:35.747 --> 02:12:37.749
SAVE THAT NO I CENTER BATES HAS

02:12:37.816 --> 02:12:39.584
A BILL THAT SAYS IF YOU LOOK AT

02:12:39.651 --> 02:12:41.253
THE TIME WHEN IT WAS BUILT AND

02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:42.821
IT WAS A BILL TO CODE AT THAT

02:12:42.888 --> 02:12:44.956
TIME THE LANGUAGE HERE SAYS THAT

02:12:45.023 --> 02:12:46.525
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU TEN YEARS.

02:12:46.591 --> 02:12:49.328
TO BRING IT UP UP TO SAFETY THAT

02:12:49.394 --> 02:12:50.796
IS MAKE IT THAT DETERMINATION BY

02:12:50.862 --> 02:12:53.398
THE INSPECTOR THE IDEA AND THEN

02:12:53.465 --> 02:12:54.466
THE IDEA WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT

02:12:54.533 --> 02:12:55.801
WITHOUT THE FEES IS THAT PEOPLE

02:12:55.867 --> 02:12:56.735
COME FORWARD.

02:12:56.802 --> 02:13:00.238
PEOPLE MAKE THE A A IMPROVEMENTS

02:13:00.305 --> 02:13:02.174
TO THE BAR THE HOME THEY START

02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:03.875
PAYING THEIR PROPERTY TAXES ON

02:13:03.942 --> 02:13:05.544
THAT GARAGE CONVERSION THE

02:13:05.610 --> 02:13:07.145
ASSESSOR COMES IN IT AND THAT'S

02:13:07.212 --> 02:13:09.514
THAT AND IN THE CITY OR THE

02:13:09.581 --> 02:13:10.115
COUNTY.

02:13:10.182 --> 02:13:11.817
THE IT I'LL YOU KNOW DOES THE

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:13.118
ARCHITECTURAL WOULD PUT

02:13:13.185 --> 02:13:14.286
IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE CIVIL YOU

02:13:14.353 --> 02:13:15.520
KNOW PUT A DOOR AND THERE WERE

02:13:15.587 --> 02:13:17.489
MAKE IT LOOK NICER SO SO WE

02:13:17.556 --> 02:13:19.424
INSTEAD OF SAYING YOU DO IT ALL

02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:20.625

02:13:20.692 --> 02:13:22.127
THEM A PERIOD.

02:13:22.194 --> 02:13:23.862
BECAUSE I AYE IT BELIEVED THAT

02:13:23.929 --> 02:13:27.099
THE M. FOR CLINTON MEAN THERE'S

02:13:27.165 --> 02:13:28.333

LEGAL -- SO

02:13:35.374 --> 02:13:37.442
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHY

02:13:37.509 --> 02:13:39.845
OF OF GIVING THEM THAT TIME

02:13:39.911 --> 02:13:42.147
PERIOD UNTIL IT WAS THE PROPERTY

02:13:42.214 --> 02:13:46.084
TAX IT WOULD BE UP ON THEM FROM.

02:13:46.151 --> 02:13:48.887
A THIS POINT ON NOT THE

02:13:48.954 --> 02:13:51.189
TERMINATION OF THE PASSAGE E.

02:13:51.256 --> 02:13:52.924

02:13:52.991 --> 02:13:54.559
YES THAT'S THAT'S THE BILL

02:13:54.626 --> 02:13:55.827
BEFORE YOU IS THAT IT STARTS

02:13:55.894 --> 02:13:57.596
WHEN THEY COME IN AND AGAIN THIS

02:13:57.662 --> 02:13:58.930
IS A BIG PROBLEM OUT THERE THAT

02:13:58.997 --> 02:14:00.365
THESE FOLKS ARE THERE AND IF I

02:14:00.432 --> 02:14:01.500
IF I MADE THEM PAY THE

02:14:01.566 --> 02:14:03.602
RETROACTIVE PROPERTY TAX NOBODY

02:14:03.668 --> 02:14:04.636
COME FORWARD.

02:14:04.703 --> 02:14:06.638
LA REGIS WOULD HIT SAY NO THAT'S

02:14:06.705 --> 02:14:08.774
NOT THERE'S NO DEAL THERE --

02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:10.642
SO.

02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:12.210
NOW WITH THAT AN AMNESTY ARE

02:14:12.277 --> 02:14:15.080
MOVING FOR THE FROM NOW ON RIGHT

02:14:15.747 --> 02:14:18.617
IT OKAY.

02:14:18.683 --> 02:14:22.554
SO ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION --

02:14:22.621 --> 02:14:24.523
SO YOU KNOW AGAIN MY PERSPECTIVE

02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:26.992
HE AYE I HEAR WHAT I THINK I'M.

02:14:27.058 --> 02:14:29.027
HERE IS A DIFFERENT.

02:14:29.094 --> 02:14:30.462
SUGGESTED AMENDMENT THAT SOMEHOW

02:14:30.529 --> 02:14:32.063
THERE BE AN AMNESTY WHICH WOULD

02:14:32.130 --> 02:14:33.565
APPLY FROM WHEN THIS BILL GOES

02:14:33.632 --> 02:14:34.933
TO EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST TWO

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.468
WHEN THE REPORT.

02:14:36.535 --> 02:14:39.671
GETS RESOLVED WHO WILLING AND WE

02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:41.006
AND THEY RENEW YOUR INTO WE

02:14:41.072 --> 02:14:43.575
CODIFY WHAT IT SO SO IN EUROPE

02:14:43.642 --> 02:14:45.210
IT WHAT YOU'VE SAID TODAY IS

02:14:45.277 --> 02:14:47.446
THAT IS IF THIS BILL BECAME LAW.

02:14:47.512 --> 02:14:49.181
BEGINNING JANUARY ONE OF NEXT

02:14:49.247 --> 02:14:50.982
YEAR THERE WOULD BE NO FEES THAT

02:14:51.049 --> 02:14:52.818
PEOPLE COULD.

02:14:52.884 --> 02:14:53.952
WHAT DID YOU MISS A PAL THESE

02:14:54.019 --> 02:14:55.854
AND COUNTIES COULD A CHARGE THE

02:14:55.921 --> 02:14:57.656
SCHOOLS WILL GET A THREE

02:14:57.722 --> 02:14:58.690
THOUSAND DOLLAR THERE WOULD BE

02:14:58.757 --> 02:15:00.592
AN AMNESTY PERIOD WHERE PEOPLE

02:15:00.659 --> 02:15:02.127
WOULD COME IN AND SAY?

02:15:02.194 --> 02:15:04.129
I WANT IT I WANTED --

02:15:04.196 --> 02:15:05.897
I WANT TO COME LEGAL AND DO THIS

02:15:05.964 --> 02:15:07.966
THEN WE WILL BE RACING THE CLOCK

02:15:08.033 --> 02:15:10.602
WITH HDDS REPORT IF IT EIGHT CD

02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:12.270
COMES UP WITH ITS REPORT ISSUE

02:15:12.337 --> 02:15:13.438
SAID NEXT YEAR AND THERE'S

02:15:13.505 --> 02:15:15.540
LEGISLATION THAT WE TAKE THAT

02:15:15.607 --> 02:15:16.107
SAY.

02:15:16.174 --> 02:15:18.210
THE EXCESS RECALLING UNITS SHALL

02:15:18.276 --> 02:15:21.313
PAY. NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED

02:15:21.379 --> 02:15:22.714
FIFTY AS A REASONABLE FEE FOR

02:15:22.781 --> 02:15:24.249
THE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT THAT THEY

02:15:24.316 --> 02:15:25.951
WOULD HAVE AND CITIES ARE ABLE

02:15:26.017 --> 02:15:27.853
TO CHARGE THAT THEN JANUARY ONE

02:15:27.919 --> 02:15:31.323
OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT WOULD BE.

02:15:31.389 --> 02:15:32.123
WE AYE I'VE.

02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:32.757
GOTTA GO TALK TO LEDGE COUNCIL

02:15:32.824 --> 02:15:34.226
BUT THAT WOULD BE THE LAW THAT

02:15:34.292 --> 02:15:36.495
WOULD THAT WITH THIS LITTLE

02:15:36.561 --> 02:15:38.597
WINDOW WOULD GO AWAY AND IF IT

02:15:38.663 --> 02:15:42.501
WAS. ZERO THEN IT WOULD SAY.

02:15:42.567 --> 02:15:43.802
SO IF I CAN'T OF MY COMMITTEE

02:15:43.869 --> 02:15:45.570
SEPARATE MY ME WE CAN'T TAKE

02:15:45.637 --> 02:15:46.404
AMENDMENTS AT THIS POINT SITE
