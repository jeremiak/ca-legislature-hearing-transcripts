LET ME JUST TRY YOUR ATTENTION TO THE BACKGROUND REPORT PREPARED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AMONG OTHER INFORMATION YOU WILL FIND AN OVERVIEW OF OUR STATE ECONOMY. THE INCREASING CHALLENGE INCOME INEQUALITY IS HAVING ON MANY CALIFORNIANS. A SHORT PROFILE ON THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND THEN JUST SPECIAL TENDENCIES ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE WHICH IS WHAT THE COMMITTEE DOES OVERSEE. ARE THE CURRENT STATE OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND RELATED LEGISLATION REPORTS AS WELL AS BUDGET ACTIONS. REPORT ALSO HAS AN APPENDIX ON OPPORTUNITIES JONES WHICH AN ERROR WHICH IS AN AREA THAT HAS BEEN RECEIVING A LOT OF ATTENTION OVER THIS PAST YEAR.

THAT IS GOING TO BE AN AGENDA ITEM FIVE PLEASE SIGN UP YOU CAN SIGN UP AT THE REGISTRATION TABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PUBLIC COMMENT. THE COMMITTEE IS ALSO ACCEPT JEAN WRITTEN COMMENTS UNTIL OCTOBER THIRTIETH OF TWO OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. LET'S GO AHEAD AND START WITH OUR FIRST SPEAKER ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE. OUR FIRST SPEAKER WHOSE DOCTOR CARTOGRAPHIC CHRISTIAN CHAIR OF THE CENTER FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE DR I'M A CHRISTIAN ALSO INSTRUCTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE AS A PROFESSOR IN THE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY. HE COMES TO THESE DUTIES WITH THE UNIQUE PRIVATE SECTOR BACKGROUND I HAVE INSERTED THE SENIOR PARTNER WITH MACKENZIE IN COMPANY IN A LECTURE ON INEQUALITY AT THE STANFORD BUSINESS SCHOOL. WE HAVE INVITED DR I'M A CHRISTIAN TO BRIEF THE COMMITTEE ON ACTIVITIES OF NEW INITIATIVES THAT HE LAUNCH THIS YEAR IN. WHICH IS CALLED INLAND CALIFORNIA RISING. TO PRESENT RESEARCH FROM THE CENTER STATE. ARE FROM THE CENTERS STATE OF THE INLAND EMPIRE SERIES IN ITS RECENT COLLABORATION WITH THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE I ADVANCING OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA'S INLAND EMPIRE. WE WILL BE GOING INTO. DISCUSSING PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF ALL THIS RESEARCH A DOCTOR I'M A CHRISTIAN PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. GREAT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU CHAIR CERVANTES ALLAH AND MEMBERS OF THE MEMBERS AND STAFF TO THE COMMITTEE AND MEMBERS OF. THE PUBLIC ONE THING I SHOULD NOTICE A CORRECTION THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LINEAMENT DUNCES FIVE WITH MACKENZIE. I AM A SINNER ENTREPRENEUR OF SORTS BUT THAT DID NOT WORK IN THE CAN. WHAT I'M GONNA DO TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HELP SET THE STAGE WHILE I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR CENTER. MOST OF OUR WORK IS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY WITH BUSINESSES WITH NON PROFITS MORE BROADLY SO IT'S A WEIGHTY RESPONSIBILITY BUT ALSO AN EXCITING AND IMPORTANT PRIVILEGE. TO BE ABLE TO SET THE STAGE ABOUT ALL OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS HAPPENING. IN OUR REGION AND ONE THING I'LL SAY IS. THESE KIND OF PARTNERSHIPS ARE EVIDENT NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WORK. BUT EVEN SAY IN TERMS OF CENSUS OUT REACH SO ARE CENTER IS WORKING. HAND IN GLOVE WITH BOTH COUNTIES BOTH RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND SEPARATE IN COUNTY. AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR. TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE COUNTS BECAUSE IT MEANS SO MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO RESOURCES. FROM THE FEDERAL STATE GOVERNMENT BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND THAT'S- PART OF THE MESSAGE WE'RE TRYING TO SEND AS WELL. IS THAT SENSES IS VITAL FOR BUSINESS AND WE NEED TO HAVE ALL BUSINESSES INVOLVED IN ENGAGE WHEN IT COMES TO INSURING. AN ACCURATE AND COMPLETE COUNT. SO TO SEE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CSI WE ARE NOT THE LATEST CBS SHOW. FEATURED IN RIVERSIDE IT'S THE CENTER FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION. AND ONE OF THE PAST AS YOU WILL SEE. THAT WE USE. IS INLAND AND OF IT. PART OF WHAT WE- DO IS RESHAPE THAT PART OF THE- AND MORE GENERALLY INLAND CALIFORNIA I'LL TALK ABOUT LATER. WHEN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHERE INNOVATION IS HAPPENING THEY DON'T THINK IMMEDIATELY OF THE INLAND EMPIRE OR OF INLAND CALIFORNIA AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO NOT ONLY FOCUS ON THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR REGION. BUT IMPORTANTLY TO FOCUS ON THE LEADERSHIP THE IMPORTANT INITIATIVES AND ULTIMATELY TO SHOW NOT ONLY THE INNOVATION. BUT TO SHOW THE INVESTMENT READINESS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A LOT MORE INVESTMENTS. ARE COMING INTO THE STATE. WE HAVE BOTH AND BOTH IN THE MATERIALS THAT IT THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS MATERIALS THAT WE HAVE HERE. SEVERAL REPORTS AND I'LL BE DIGGING MORE DEEPLY INTO THE STATE OF WORK REPORT. BUT ANOTHER IMPORTANT REPORT THAT RELATES TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS THE STATE OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE DID THAT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH. OUR INLAND COALITION FOR IMMIGRANT JUST AS WELL CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR PERFORMANCE MANY WILL HAVE A STEREOTYPE OF THE INLAND EMPIRE AS ONE WHERE IMMIGRANTS ARE NOT IMPORTANT. WILL BE SHIPPED IN THAT REPORT AND IN THE ACCOUNT FOR ONE OUT OF EVERY RESIDENTS IN THE STATE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PARTICULAR SECTORS LIKE AGRICULTURE IN EASTERN. ACCOUNT RENTS ARE SEVERELY ALL PURPOSE THERE OR IF WE TALK ABOUT THE LOGISTICS SECTOR AND WESTERN SAT IN A COUNTY. IMPRINTS ARE HAPPILY REPRESENTED THERE AS WELL. BUT ON TOP OF THAT. NOT JUST ABOUT THOSE PARTICULAR SECTORS. WE LOOK AT IMMIGRANTS THEY'RE ALSO INVEST IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR. ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT EIGHT AND IMMIGRANTS. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE OF WHICH THERE ARE NUMEROUS AND FAST GROWING. AND WE ALSO FIND PARTICULAR DYNAMICS OF ASIAN IMMIGRANTS IN. THIS REGION FOR EXAMPLE WITH FILIPINOS BEING A MUCH LARGER PART OF THE ASIAN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY HERE THAN THEY ARE IN ORANGE COUNTY OR LA COUNTY. SO HAPPY TO DIG DEEPER INTO THAT IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS. SO DO CAN BE PRESENTS SOME BASIC FACTS THAT YOU'LL SEE IN OUR REPORT AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER REPORTS THAT SET THE STAGE. ONE UNEMPLOYMENT WAS VERY HIGH IN THE INLAND EMPIRE PARTICULAR. AND THE PEAK OF THE GREAT RECESSION. BUT WE'VE COVERED IN PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WAY SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE JOB GROWTH STORY. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE CLIMATE ABOUT WHERE IT IS FOR ALL FORMULA AND WHERE IT IS FOR THE RIGHT COUNTRY SO. IT HAS AN IMPACT OF GROWTH IN OUT IN JOBS. RIGHT WAY TO LOOK AT THAT IS JOB GROWTH OUR RIVERSIDE CAP HE AND SEVERAL COUNTY VIEW FROM TWO THOUSAND ONE TO TWO EIGHT JOB RATE HAS EXCEEDED THE STATE AVERAGE. AND YET AT THE SAME TIME THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAS BEEN ON EITHER. I AND PLAN PARRIS ISLAND AND YET. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. AS IN THE IN THE NATION ARE HIRING TO INSECTS ON THE PROPERTY THE SESSIONS ABOUT THE NUMBER CHALLENGE. PARTICULARLY GIVEN INCREASE IN HELPING CALL OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN THE STREET. OUR COMMON INTEREST ALL HIGHER UP AFTER CONSERVE TINO'S SOME. TENSION TO THE EQUITY LANDS. POLICE PURPOSE BY YOU PLEASE PUT FULL TIME THIRTY HOURS MORE PER WEEK AND YOU WHICH IS FIFTY REFER TO EXPRESS. I'M FINE PARTY TO HIGHEST AMONG AMERICAN AFTER CANCEL TINO'S AND AMONG WOMEN ESPECIALLY AMONG THESE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AS A REMINDER LATINOS REPRESENT A MAJORITY OF OUR REGION IN A RECENT HAS BEEN QUOTE UNQUOTE MAJORITY MINORITY FOR MANY YEARS NOW. WE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE ARE ON THAT REPORT OUR WEATHER EARNING ENOUGH GET THE HIGH COST OF LIVING. TECH IS TO LIVE EIGHT STANDARD WITHOUT OKAY LATER IS THAT ARE PARTICULAR TO THE REASON COMING UP THE UNIVERSE WASHINGTON. ARE SO THAT'S EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORKERS THAT ARE EARNING THREE THOUSAND MORE. ABOUT JUST SHY OF 40% MEET THAT STANDARD AND THERE'S SIX TAKEN ON AT GAPS AS WHAT WAS JEFF GAPS. ENTER WORK TO MEET THAT STANDARD. WE COMPARE. IN THE AUTUMN PART TWO OTHER OPTIONS CALVET IN ORDER SPEAKERS FIND THAT A LOT THEY PROVIDE ACCESS EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE AT LESS ACCESS TO TIME YOUR CHOPS. WE DO HAVE A HIGHER SKILLED AS A SET OF OCCUPATIONS ARE A AND SECTORS THAT BETTER RICHER IN THOSE BUT THEY ARE UNDER REPRESENTED IN THIS REGION COMPARED TO OTHERS A ONE OF THE KEY THEMES THAT I PERSONALLY IN OUR CENTER WILL RECOMMEND BUT IT ALSO COMES THROUGH IN SOME OF THESE REPORTS. IS THAT WE NEED GREATER DIVERSIFICATION IN IN TERMS OF OUR ECONOMY TO NOT ONLY PUT PROVIDE THOSE PATHWAYS TO. MIDDLE CLASS JOBS FOR THOSE WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WHO DO HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES WHO FIND THAT THEY HAVE TO COMMUTE OUT TO LA COUNTY IN ORANGE COUNTY IN ORDER TO SEEK OPPORTUNITY. OUR CENTER ALSO DID A SEARCH IN COLLABORATION WITH A CALIFORNIA NEWS WHICH INCLUDES ENTITIES LIKE THE RIVER BY PRESS CENTER AS AND TEMPORARY NOT ON BUT ALSO FORGED REGISTER AND THE- DAILY NEWS. AND WHAT WE FOR THEIR RESPECT TO WHAT THE. WANTS TO SEE AN INTERACTIVE IMPROVING JOB SPECS REGION. WE FIND THAT THERE OF WAITING THIS DICHOTOMY BETWEEN SAY UPSCALING BOB'S AND IN ORDER TO ACTION. AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THIS SUPPORT BOTH FOR IMPROVING OUR PROTECTING WORKERS RIGHTS WHICH YOU'LL SEE A RIGHT HAND AND ALL. ACTUALLY SET UP BOTH PANELS AS WELL AS AS- IT'S A GOOD CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION WHICH IS IN A RAP BATTLE IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT NEEDING MORE UP. IS STRONG SUPPORT FOR THOSE RIGHT BECAUSE OF THE FORTY PERCENT. AFTER ABOUT FORTY. S. SUPPORT FOR BOTH OF THIS STRATEGY AND SO THAT'S JUST READ PORTENT. IN MANY WAYS TIED INTO THE WORK FUTURE THE COMMISSION I IN THE STATE HOUSE. A IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE FOR AN UPSCALE. IT'S IMPORTANT FOCUS ON THAT AS WELL AS A WORKER TIONS TO MAKE SURE. REALLY BY THOSE DOES PATHWAYS. TO ONLY MIDDLE CLASS JOBS BUT ALSO MIDDLE CLASS LIVING IN OUR REGION. THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BROOKINGS AND THEIR ROLE IN AYE EGO WHICH IS AN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY IT'S A IT'S I'D LIKE TO WHICH I WAS THE WE ACTUALLY THE LOCAL LEVEL WORKING PARTNERSHIP WITH CHILD CARE IS SET YOU SHOW US SHOP AND GOODMAN. FOR THE CALL AUTHORS OF AN ECONOMIC INTELLIGENCE REPORT THAT SET THE STAGE FOR THE STRATEGY WRECKED NATION HAVE AS PART OF AYE EGO ARE YOU CAN FIND THIS REPORT ON THE BROOKINGS WEBSITE. AND WE HAVE COPIES. OF THE AYE EGO STRATEGY REPORT HERE. AND THE THEMES WILL BE VERY FAMILIAR. RIGHT EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD AT OUR JOB GROWTH AND SIMILAR CHART IN THE BROOKINGS REPORT THAT SHOWS IMPROPER JOB GROWTH. A FAMILY THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO GET BY THE MEASURE THEM WHAT WE HAD WHICH IS A LIVING WEEKS INVOLVING INVEST WORKERS. USING THIS MEASURE LOOKING FAMILY FORTY PER CENT WORKING FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING AND HAS REMAINED PERSISTENTLY HIGH WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN GETTING THAT DOWN. BROOKINGS ALSO PIONEERED A NEW WAY OF LOOKING AT QUOTE UNQUOTE GOOD JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY JOBS GOOD JOBS ARE THOSE THAT PAY EIGHTEEN HOURS AND HOURS OF USING THE CPAP WE HAVE. HAVE PLAYED PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE. AND THIS IS A FULL TIME WORK. AND WHAT THE NINE IS THAT ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. OF JACOB'S ARE HERE ARE TING FOR. LOOK AT WHO DON'T HAVE WAS THE EIGHTIES I'M ONLY 17% OF. CAN BECAUSE THE FIGHTER AT AS JOB THE 4% ARE PER SE. ALL THE GREAT ABOUT IS WHAT THE AND GRAY. AND THOSE ARE BOB SAID NEITHER GOOD NOR PROMISING MISSING THOSE ARE NOT NOW I CAN PRO I'D MOBILITY POWER PLAYS FOR WORKERS WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE TO HAVE THAT PROFILE IN TERMS OF WAGES AND BENEFITS. I CAN BE A FIVE GOOD SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD CONCERN US ALL IN AND FORTUNATELY. THERE ARE SEVERAL INITIATIVES UNDER WAY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS. THE BROOKINGS REPORT ALSO SHOWS SIGNIFICANT RACIAL AND ETHNIC GAPS SO IF YOU LOOK. AT ALL LEVELS OF EDUCATION. FIVE AND THAT OUR COMMUNITIES OF COPPER AND ESPECIALLY HISPANIC WOMEN AND BY WOMEN OUR DISADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THESE JOBS AND PROMISING. TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE KEY FINDINGS WHICH YOU FIND OF THE REPORT. AUTOMATION PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT THREATS IN AREAS LIKE LOGISTICS IN OUR REGION. REASON HAS IMPORTANT ASSETS INITIATIVE SECOND GROW GRASS MANY STRING. EMERGING SECTORS I AM TALK ABOUT THOSE IN A MINUTE OUR OPPORTUNITIES. FOR UPCOMING DIVERSIFICATION IN A LITTLE CLASS. TO THAT AND FINALLY THERE ARE IMPORTANT AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OF REASON. TO BE SCALED UP AND BETTER CONNECTED CROPS THIS BASS REASON OF THE INLAND EMPIRE. IN TERMS OF KEY STRATEGIES THAT FLOWED OUT OF THIS I SHOULD NOTE THAT THE LASER FOCUS OF THIS REPORT IS TO GROW BUT ACOSTA FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES. SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS HERE. THINK OF THIS AS THE BLUEPRINT FOR A REASON I THINK IT IS A BLUEPRINT FOR VISION AND I'LL TALK ABOUT OUR- INITIATIVES ANOTHER THEMES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO INVEST IN AS WELL. WHAT MAKE THE WRITTEN THE HOME OF GLOBAL IN XIN AND THE LOGISTICS. STREET TAKE SOME RIGHT NOW THAT IS. CLINTON A PROBLEM AND TO TURN IT INTO AN SET SOMETHING THAT WE CAN IMPROVE ON. TING ON MEASURES OF AND- AN ABILITY. IN TERMS UP OF WORKER PAY AND BACK THAT'S- AS WELL POTENTIALLY SAW US SOME OF THE OTHER TOWNS AS WE MIGHT FACE. ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AND THERE ARE. IT SHOULD IS N. ASSETS REGION OR WORKING ON THESE ISSUES. NEXT ANOTHER KEY STRATEGIES TO STRENGTHEN THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE REGION'S ADVANCE MANUFACTURERS MANUFACTURING HAS DECLINED OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN OUR REGION IT'S IN A BIT OF A REBOUND. WHAT CAN WE DO TO MOVE FROM STANDARD MANUFACTURING TO ADVANCED MANUFACTURING THAT'S GOING TO BE KEY CHALLENGE FOR THE REGION. NEXT WE NEED TO ACCELERATE THE GROWTH OF PROMISING EMERGING INDUSTRIES WITH BUT THE POTENTIAL OF GROWING A LOT OF MIDDLE CLASS JOBS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TO THE RELOCATION OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD IT'S CALIFORNIA OFFICE. TO RIVERSIDE FROM EL MONTE. THERE ARE A LOT OF HIGH SKILLED JOBS THAT ARE COMING WITHOUT WITH THOSE RESEARCHERS THAT ARE PART OF CARB. BUT NOW WE'RE EXTENDING BEYOND THE TO SEE WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF ENTERPRISES CONNECTED TO EMISSIONS TESTING. AND LATER I'LL TALK ABOUT GREEN KNOWLEDGE NON EMISSIONS TESTING. PART COULD BE IN CHANGE IN OUR REGION. MANY OF US ARE ARE LOOKING AT. IT THAT WAY AND I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT MORE IN THE. SELECT IS OPEN IMPORTANT. SECTOR THAT THAT SHOWS PROMISE OF FINE LITTLE MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AND FINALLY CYBERSECURITY ESPECIALLY WITH THE ASSETS AT CAL STATE SAMBAR DINO NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CENTER FOR TRAINING AND CYBERSECURITY IT'S MOSTLY COLLEGE GRADUATES BUT POTENTIALLY WITH SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT WE OFFER THE POTENTIAL FOR THOSE WITHOUT FOUR YEAR COLLEGE DEGREES THOSE WITH TECHNICAL CERTIFICATES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. AND FINALLY AS I MENTIONED BEFORE ANOTHER KEY STRATEGY RECOGNITION THE SIX ARE THE ADOPTION OF WORK IS CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. WITH A PROTECTIVE FOCUS ON ATTRACTING WOMEN AND HE'S OF COLOR. AGAIN I WOULD REFER YOU BACK TO THAT SLIDE THAT SHOWED THAT WOMEN IN COMMUTERS COLORED ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR OR SEVERELY DISADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF THEIR ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS AND PROMISING JOBS. NEXTEL GO BEYOND A YOU GO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE PREPARED IN COLLABORATION WITH I. E. P. FOR THE REGION'S RISE TOGETHER. BUT AS YOU SEE CIRCLE ONE WHICH IS EXPECTING BILLS COACH OUT. BUT THE NOT THE ONLY IMPORTANT PART HE'S IN OUR GEN. OTHER PARTIES AS WELL TO JUST IT HIGH SKILL JOBS AND RESEARCH COMMERCIALIZATION. THREE GREEN TACK N. SUSTAINABILITY OTHER IMPORTANT SURE THAT IS IT GEN. ARE CONNECTED TO CARVE AS WELL AS OTHER GREEN TECHNOLOGY. IMPORTANT RESEARCH ASSETS THE UNIVERSITY CAL HI BUT ALSO WITH INCUBATORS I'M SORRY GEN. BETTER CONNECT ON THAT ISSUE. CRADLED CAREER ARE SOME OF THIS ALREADY IS PART OF IT. BUT IT DOES BE UNDER JOB AT THE FOCUS OFF. ON A CERTIFICATE AND WAYS. TO GO TO GO FOR PRE K. ALL THE WAY THROUGH A CAREER SUCCESS. FIVE FOCUSED ON ENEMY IN PLANNING HONEST PLEA. SURE. BOTH LOCAL REGIONAL AND THE CONVERSATION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT NOT I STATED AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH SMART THING WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING WHEN IT COMES TO TRACK PATIENT AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY GREAT TUNE THREE AND THIS IS IN THAT K. GORDON WHO'S THE HEAD OF OFFICE IN PLANNING AND RESEARCH HAS THAT AS CAP GROWTH DEVELOPS ECONOMICALLY WE NEED TO BE SMARTER AND HOW WE DO IT AND ESPECIALLY. FOR ME TO BE IN OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOALS. AND FINALLY IT MIGHT BE STRANGE TO SEE A THEME LIKE STRONGER NONPROFITS AS WE TALK ABOUT INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. BUT NONPROFITS ARE SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR REGION. WE TALK ABOUT OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WE TALK ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR. AND ALSO IF WE TALK ABOUT SMALLER NONPROFITS THAT ARE PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT. AND ARE DOING IMPORTANT WORK AT ALREADY REFERENCED ARE THE WORK OF THE SENSES AS ONE IMPORTANT EXAMPLE. AND WE HAVE FOR YOUR REFERENCE IN IN THE DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS HERE TODAY. AS LISTING A IT'S A PRELIMINARY LIST. WE TRY TO FIT AS MANY INITIATIVES AS WE CAN INTO TWO PAGES UNDER THESE THEMES. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. THERE ARE A LOT OF INCREDIBLE THINGS HAPPENING IN OUR REGION. WE DON'T WANT ANYONE'S PITY WE DON'T WANT ANYONE'S CHARITY WE WANT EVERYONE'S INVESTMENT WE WANT THEIR ATTENTION. AND THIS IS PART OF WHAT INLAND CALIFORNIA RISING IS TRYING TO DO SO THIS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT INLAND CALIFORNIA RISING. WHEN WE START OUR CENTER A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WE INVITED ACTUALLY SWEAR ENGINE FORMER MAYOR MODERATE REPUBLICAN FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WHO IS A PRAGMATIST SHE'S NOT IDEOLOGICAL. SHE WAS LASER FOCUS ON FIGURING OUT HOW CAN WE GROW INVESTMENTS IN FRESNO. AND TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS A BROWN ADMINISTRATION. ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT ECONOMIC BENEFITS CONNECTED TO HIGH SPEED RAIL ANOTHER IMPORTANT TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS HAD FRESNO IS AN IMPORTANT AREA OF INVESTMENT. SO WHEN WE STARTED OUR CENTER WE WANTED TO FEATURE SOMEONE THAT WE COULD. WE COULD LOOK AT AS AN EXAMPLE OF COURSE WE COULD LOOK TO COASTAL CALIFORNIA. BUT SO MUCH OF WHAT WE FACE ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT OTHERS AN INLAND CALIFORNIA FACE. SO WHEN I. FIRST PRESENTED AND I STILL USE THIS MAP OF CALIFORNIA AND I THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT. I SAY IS THAT I SOMEONE TO DROP PINS ON A MAP IN TERMS OF WHERE IS INNOVATION HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA WE ASK MOST PEOPLE DROP THOSE PLANS. WILL BE A WHOLE BUNCH IS A DROP IN THAT AREA. I'M A MAYBE MORE SAVVY AND KNOW ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY MY DROP A WHOLE BUNCH OF PENS AND- IN LOS ANGELES. OR THEY KNOW ABOUT I TECH IT'S AN ATTACK IN IRVINE AND SAN DIEGO. THEY'LL DROP ALL THOSE PENS THEIR- VERY RARELY WILL YOU FIND THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN DROPPING PENS IN INLAND CALIFORNIA. WHEN ASKED ABOUT ONLY INVASION IS. THAT'S NOT BECAUSE IT IS NOT HAPPENING BUT THAT'S WHAT OUR DOMINANT ENTERED. UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF US INTO THIS TRAP ONLY FOCUSING ON ALBUMS IN TOWN IS WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE GOOD PERHAPS WHO'S DOING IT WHO DO WE NEED TO INVEST IN. AND THAT'S WHAT OUR THAT AND PART OF OUR DNA FROM THE BEGINNING THIS TO CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE. TO FOCUS ON THE CHANGE MAKERS TO FOCUS ON THE INNOVATORS. AND TO REALLY PUSH HARD ON THIS NOTION THAT WE NEED TO GROW INVESTMENTS AND INLAND CALIFORNIA. WE HAD A SET OF CONVENING WE HAD OUR LUNCH IN A MINUTE FEBRUARY. WHERE WE HAVE IDEAS WITH KEY MEMBERS OF THE OF THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDING SPEAKER RENDON. WE ALSO HAD A MEETING WITH KEY MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM. IT WAS A COALITION OF MAYORS COMMITTEE FOUNDATION CEOS AND UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS THAT'S ALL THE PEOPLE WE COULD FIT INTO THE GOVERNOR'S CONFERENCE ROOM THAT DAY. SINCE THEN WE'VE HAD A SUMMIT HERE WHERE WE HAD THE HONOR OF HAVING YOU SO MEMBER CERVANTES ADDRESS AS WELL ADDRESS THE CROWD AS WELL AS OTHERS. WE ALSO HAD STRONG SHOW OF SUPPORT FROM STATE PARTNERS INCLUDE INCLUDING LADY MAN DANSA. THE HEAD OF GOLD IS AS WELL AS QUE GORDON FROM OPR. AS WELL AS AN IMPORTANT SHOW OF SUPPORT FROM MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI FROM LOS ANGELES. JUST LAST WEEK WE HAD A FOLLOW UP MEETING IN STOCKTON AND THAT WAS ALSO VERY WELL ATTENDED. AND IMPORTANTLY KATHLEEN KELLY JANICE WHO THE GOVERNOR SENIOR ADVISER ON SOCIAL INNOVATION. WORK WITH US AND THE CITY OF STOCKTON. TO HAVE A MEETING OF. PHILANTHROPIC LEADERS IN THE STATE INCLUDING JAMES IRVINE FOUNDATION THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT I SHOULD KNOW THAT I'M ON THE BOARD OF THE CALIFORNIA DOWN AT. GATES FOUNDATION CHAN'S OCCUR BERGENHUS ELEVEN MANY OTHERS IT WAS REALLY INSPIRING TO SEE AND WE'RE HOPEFUL. THAT WOULD EFFORTS LIKE THIS THAT WE WILL GROW INVESTMENTS ALL UP AND DOWN INLAND CALIFORNIA. TWO INITIATIVES ARE THAT ARE CENTERS WORKING ON THAT COME OUT OF INLAND CALIFORNIA RISING. ONE RELATES TO OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. SO HERE WE HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF PARTNERING WITH AMERICA SAID HE AND HIS EX OPERATOR FOR AMERICA INITIATIVES. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FUSE CORPS. SO IF PEOPLE ARE NOT NO FUSE CORPS FOR A FEW YEARS NOW HAS BEEN PLACING VERY SUCCESSFUL MID CAREER EXECUTIVES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO WORK ON INNOVATIVE EFFORTS. NOT HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE IN OUR REASON TO YET HAVE A FUSE FOLLOW BUT NOW I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO FUSE FELLOWS WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR CENTER ONE WITH RIVERSIDE COUNTY EDA AND THE OTHER WITH SOMEBODY IN COUNTY EDA THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND BOTH OF THOSE COUNTIES. TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES HERE TO GROW INVESTMENTS BUT TO DO SO IN A WAY. THAT PROVIDE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND ADDRESS SOME OF THESE RACIAL. AND GENDER DISPARITIES THAT WE FLAG. RIGHT WE DON'T JUST WANT TO THROW MONEY. TO ADVANTAGE WINNERS WHO ARE ALREADY DOING FINE. WE WANT TO HAVE THAT FOCUS ON HOW TO IMPROVE THE SOCIAL GOOD. AS WE GROW INVESTMENTS AND ALLOW OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTORS TO PROFIT IN THIS REGION. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING AN EFFORT CALLED INLAND EMPIRE INTO AN ECOSYSTEM OR BE SQUARED FOR SHORT. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SOME PARTNERS THAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM LATER ON TODAY CLEANING THE OUR COG THE WATSON RIVERSIDE COUNCIL GOVERNMENT'S. COUNTY RIVERSIDE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE CITY OF CORONA. AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERS IN SAN PRETTY ACCOUNT. HOPE TO DO IS TO PRODUCE A COMPANION REPORT TO AYE EGO. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE ONLY JOBS WERE CREATING THIS REASON ARE ARE FOR THOSE WITHOUT COLLEGE DEGREES WE KNOW. THAT OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES PRODUCE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GRADUATES OVER A DECADE HIGH SKILLED. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE SO MANY ASSETS IN THIS REGION IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. THAT CAN ATTRACT HIGH SKILLED WORKERS NO MATTER WHERE THEY GOT THEIR DEGREES. SO THAT IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT FOCUS. IN TERMS OF. IN TERMS OF DOING COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH BUT IMPORTANTLY GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT. THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF WHAT. INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THIS REGION LOOKS LIKE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND OPENED ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I DO HAVE A COUPLE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AND FOR THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE IF YOU DO HAVE QUESTIONS I HOPE BY A DOCTOR I'M A CHRISTIAN IS ABLE TO STAY. TO THE END THANK YOU. SO WE HAVE MANY REGIONAL LEADERS IN THIS ROOM TODAY LOCAL LEADERS FROM SAMBAR DO NOT COUNTY TO RIVERSIDE COUNTY. REPRESENT MANY DIFFERENT AREAS I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTIONS THAT THE INLAND EMPIRE CAN TAKE TO SUPPORT A POOR MOBILITY WITHIN THIS NEXT YEAR. EXCELLENT QUESTION. WELL I THINK WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT ROADMAP ALREADY AS I'VE MENTIONED BUT THESE INITIATIVES I THINK THE KEY AND THIS IS WHERE. THE STATE CAN BE AN IMPORTANT PARTNER. WE'RE SAYING THIS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WERE SAYING THIS FROM THE LEGISLATURE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE A STRONG CALIFORNIA YOU NEED TO HAVE STRONG REGIONS. THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL WHICH IS THE HASHTAG AND THEME THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS IT IS IT IS NOT JUST USING IT'S KEY TO THEIR FRAMING OF WHERE CALIFORNIANS TO GO. WE CANNOT HAVE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL IF WE DON'T HAVE AN IN THE INLAND EMPIRE THAT A STRONG. RIGHT WERE OVER FOUR AND A HALF MILLION RESIDENTS IN THE NEXT CENSUS IS PROBABLY GOING TO SHOW AN EVEN GREATER JOB IN THOSE NUMBERS. SO THE KEY IS TO. HIGHLIGHT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES BUT I THINK AN IMPORTANT PIECE WILL BE TO SEE HOW CAN WE BEST LEVERAGE. PUBLIC PUBLIC DOLLARS TO ENCOURAGE PRIVATE INVESTMENT. WE ALSO NEED TRANSFORMATIONAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR REGION I'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE RELOCATION OF CARB THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT HEAD AND HEAVY LEFT WHERE WE HAVE PARTNERS THROUGHOUT OUR REGION NOT JUST IN THE CITY OF RIVERSIDE RIVERSIDE COUNTY BUT ALSO IN ST REDDING COUNTY SEEING THAT THAT WOULD BE A GAME CHANGER FOR OUR REGION. WE'RE HOPING IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT AND NOT JUST REST CONTENT. BUT THAT BY ITSELF IS GOING TO BE. TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR A REGION. SO THIS IS WHY FOCUSING ON A GREEN TECH CLEAN TECH ECOSYSTEM IS GOING TO BE SO IMPORTANT. BUT ANOTHER IMPORTANT PIECE IS WHAT THAT FUTURE OF LOGISTICS IS GONNA LOOK LIKE. WE HAVE RESEARCH FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS. THE PORTRAYS A PRETTY GRIM PICTURE OF WHAT AN UNEMPLOYMENT WILL LOOK LIKE IN THIS REGION. IF WE DON'T GET AHEAD OF WHAT THAT AUTOMATION REVOLUTION WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER WAY. WHEN IT REACHES ITS ADVANCED STAGES WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WHAT THAT'S GONNA MEAN FOR THIS REGION. ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE RESILIENT. BUT THERE'S ALSO IMPORTANT INNOVATIONS THAT WE NEED TO DO WITHIN OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. IN LOGISTICS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE PREPARED FOR THAT EVENTUALITY. AND THEN JUST A FOLLOW UP QUESTION YOU ACTUALLY JUST TOUCHED ON PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC DOLLARS. AND MY QUESTION TO YOU IS HOW CAN THE INLAND EMPIRE SUPPORT LOCAL AND REGIONAL EFFORTS TO REALLY CATALYZE CATALYZE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND HISTORICALLY. UNDER SERVED POPULATIONS IN OUR REGION. AND THERE'S MANY POCKETS THROUGH ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY. NO ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE COURSE OF DOING RESEARCH ON THE AYE YOU GO REPORT BUT EVEN AS WE'RE WORKING ON IT SQUARE NOW. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE LACK OF. CRITICAL VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THIS REGION. A LOT OF IT IS EITHER CONCERT HERE IN THE BAY AREA OR THEIR THEIR THEIR OR IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES AS WELL AS- AN ORANGE COUNTY. WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN THOSE BENEFITS ONE OF THE GOOD NEWS I WOULD SAY IS FOR EXAMPLE OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY FUSE FOLLOW. COMES WITH A VENTURE CAPITAL BACKGROUND SO HOPEFULLY SOME OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WILL MATTER. WE CAN DO SO MUCH MORE. AND VENTURE CAPITAL CAN CAN BE LARGE AND SMALL WE CAN THINK OF CROWDFUNDING MICROENTERPRISE LENDING AT A VERY. LOCAL LEVEL IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE AS WELL. AND WITHOUT WERE PARTNERING WITH RED IF WHICH IS VERY ACTIVE IN LA WITH AN INITIATIVE CALLED LA RISE SO SOCIAL ENTERPRISE. THEY TEND TO SUPPORT LARGER ORGANIZATIONS. BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH RIGHT IF THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION GOOD WELL AND OTHERS. TO SEE HOW CAN WE- DO. DO MORE A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE INVESTMENTS IN OUR REGION IT'S IN A VERY EARLY STAGE. BUT THE KEY IS THAT WE- WE NEED TO HAVE. SUPPORT WE HAVE THE SUPPORT INTERNALLY. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE EXTERNAL SUPPORT BUT ALSO. WE NEED TO CHANGE THE PERCEPTION. WITH MANY OF HIS INITIAL IS PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THIS IS HAPPENING. WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AND I SEE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY WITH DECISION MAKERS COMING FROM SACRAMENTO. TO TALK ABOUT VARIOUS INITIATIVES THAT ARE HAPPENING SO THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A ONE SIDED STEREOTYPICAL VIEW. OF WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE AND IS WHAT WHAT IS WORTH INVESTING IN. BUT CHANGING PERCEPTIONS JUST STEP ONE. WE NEED TO FOLLOW IT UP. AND WE NEED TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS THAT WILL MEAN MORE INVESTMENT BOTH LARGE AND SMALL IN OUR REGION. WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR I'M A CHRISTIAN FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING PROVIDING YOUR EXPERTISE AND INSIGHT ON THIS ISSUE MY PLEASURE. IF OUR NEXT SPEAKER WILL JOIN US AT THE PRESENTATION TABLE I WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF FRAMEWORK OF THIS AGENDA ITEM. AS WE JUST HEARD FROM OUR PRIOR SPEAKER REGIONAL LEVEL STRATEGIES HAVE MANY ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT BENEFITS. IN THE STATE AS LARGEST CALIFORNIA AT THE REGIONAL MODEL CAN BOTH CATALYSE ACTIONS LOCALLY. BUT ALSO SERVE TO AMPLIFY LOCAL STAKEHOLDER VOICES TO THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS WE HAVE WITH US AMBER BOLDEN SENIOR PROJECT MANAGER I CALIFORNIA FOR TO DISCUSS A NUMBER OF THESE TYPE OF REGIONAL INITIATIVES. AMONG OTHER INITIATIVES MISS BOLD AND WILL BRIEF THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S REGION'S RICE TOGETHER INITIATIVE FOR WHICH ORGANIZATION. IS A KEY PARTNER MISS WALDRON IF YOU'D LIKE TO BEGIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH MA'AM CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING I ALSO WANTED TO. JUST EXTEND OUR GRATITUDE TO DR I'M A CHRISTIAN FOR REALLY SETTING THE STAGE AND REALLY MAKING A CLEAR FRAMING OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING AT THE REGION'S RISE TOGETHER. MEETING SO THIS WAS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF MEETINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE HOSTED THROUGHOUT THE INLAND EMPIRE SO SPECIFICALLY THAT WAS SAM BERNIE DINO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY BUT ALSO IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

THAT MAKES THE REGION'S OTHER READ THAT THE STATE IS TO BE SUCCESSFUL UNDER ENDING THAT HAS RECEIVED REALLY SPEAK TO WHAT HELPS THE REGION'S IS TOGETHER IT'S GOING TO BE FOUND IN THE KING'S IN IN THESE DISCUSSIONS SO. WHEN YOU'RE FOR A PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR- THE APARTMENT IS YOU HE YOU SEE ARE AT THE SIX THE FIRST SHOW INNOVATION AND THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION I EAT P. OR YOU'RE IN ONCE. REGARDING THREE SPECIFIC WE IN SIGHT COMING AND SAMBAR NINETY NOW. OUR WE WERE ABLE TO BRING A WIDE RANGE OF STATE THIS TOGETHER TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ON WHAT THE INTO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT LOOKING. AT AND WHAT IT IS THAT IS REALLY GOING TO HELP THIS READ. AXE IS AN BY TALLY OF ALL THE REASONS THIS FOR. SO IN DOING I WOULD DEFINITELY SIGN UP FOR TO BE TO GAUGE. THE REGION'S RISING THE NATION AS YOU CAN SEE PROMOTE AGENTS ARE PLANNING A PARTNERSHIP KING THE- MAP HEALTH AS ONE IN. PARTICULAR ALLEN IS THE WORKING TO OVERCOME INCOME RATIO IN WITH THIS EFFORT AND IMPROVING THE CONNECTION THE COSTA RICA. AND LINK CALIFORNIA. NICE THAT. ALL OF THE REGIONS HAVE BEEN IT'S NOT THERE IS A COLLECTIVE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP THAT NEEDS. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE- ACT. ALL OF THEM ARE AT THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY. DURING THE REGION'S RISE TOGETHER. MEETING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD WELL BEFORE WE BEFORE I MOVE THEY ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE VERY CLEAR ABOUT OUR PARTNERSHIP AND THAT. WE DO HAVE THE EMMA USE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN TO JUST KIND OF DETAIL EXACTLY WHAT THE PARAMETERS ARE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH KOBE IS. AND ALSO CALIFORNIA FORWARD AND WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING TO SEE FROM OUR PARTNERSHIP THESE MEETINGS ARE GOING TO BE HELD. PLANNING AND WE'RE ACTUALLY PLANNING RIGHT NOW EVEN THROUGH THE SAN JOAQUIN. ALTHOUGH WE'RE HOUSING AND THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND- RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. THE REGION'S WILL BE THESE MEETINGS WILL BE HOSTED THROUGH NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. SO VERY QUICKLY I MEAN THIS IS A PRETTY SIMPLE DIAGRAM AND OF HOW THIS ALL PLAYS TOGETHER SO FIRST IMAGE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE STARTS WITH THE REGION'S AND REGIONAL INITIATIVE. OUR REGIONAL PARTNER AND ONE OF VERY CLEAR THAT IT REQUIRES COLLECTIVE ACTION SO AS WE CAN ABOVE REMOTE. BUT THE REGION IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHAT IT. ALLEGES. IS MY PARTNER FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. HERE THE RIGHT PRICE TOGETHER AT SOME THAT REALLY. THE OWNERSHIP AND PUTS THE AGENTS STARTING WITHIN THE REGION'S REALLY ELEVATED BEGIN THE CONVERSATION IT'S EIGHT EIGHT WHAT WE NEED THIS THE ACT NOW WE ARE LOOKING FOR. AND THEN WE CAN ARTICULATE. ASIANS TO THE STATE SO YOU SEE. YOU KNOW WHAT WE BEGIN THE DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH THE ROAD ENDS WITH FOCUS AGAIN. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND THEN AND THEN MOVING. WHEREBY AGAIN STARTING STACKS THEY WERE WERE MAKERS OKAY FAN ONE VALLEY. ALSO IS IN THE COLLECTIVE ACTION USING. VISITATION FOR LIKE THE SENATE SOCIAL INNOVATION AND ALSO PARTNERING WITH COLLECTIVE ACTION INITIATIVES LIKE A CALIFORNIA AND THE INLAND EMPIRE AND RISING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE USING THE WHAT IS BEING DONE SUCCESSFULLY IN THE REGION AND INSTEAD OF DUPLICATING THOSE EFFORTS WERE LEVERAGING. EFFORTS SO MOVING FORWARD AS WE APPROACH THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT WHICH IS GOING TO BE HOSTED IN FRESNO SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT BUT MOVING FORWARD TO THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT WE'RE GOING TO BE COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM ALL OF THESE MEETINGS. COLLECTING THAT MOVING IT FORWARD TO THE STATE AND THEN USING THAT IN OUR WORK GROUPS TO MAKE BACK LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS DURING THAT TIME AND THEN GETTING YOU BACK FROM THE GOVERNOR FOR WHAT HIS INITIATIVES ARE. AND HIS WHAT HIS PLAN IS FOR THE FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE AND FOR THE INLAND REGIONS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY SPECIFICALLY. I'M IN A DAY AND SO THE THING IS THAT. DR RAMAKRISHNAN DIMENSION DURING HIS INTONATION WERE. NUMBER THE THEME WITH BOSCH. AT THAT THAT EVIDENCE. STATIONS THAT WE WERE HAVING THAT. BUT I ALSO WANT TO. BILL. WE GO THERE THERE WERE A WIDE RANGE. FOR STATE AND WE DEFINITELY THINK THAT REALLY KANSEN PROVIDED. BY STE QUESTION WHAT THE REGION'S ME WE ARE LOOKING FOR. WE ARE THE FEEL AND WHAT WE GAP WAS CONTROL THE NARRATIVE WITH DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT REGION ARE YOU CAN. GET WE DON'T WANT TO BE. DEPENDING ON WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. NOT THOUGHT LEADERS THAT WE DO NOT. THE KEEP THAT WE'RE NOT MAKING AN EXCEPTION HERE FOR THE REGION WITH AND THE REGION. THE THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING AND WHAT DO REAL ON THE COLLECTIVE ACTION CAN. RELY ON THE- OF THE UNIVERSE EASE OF THE PROFIT WORLD AND WORKS DEVELOPMENT AND FOR SOME REASON OR MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO WE ARE A LOT THAT IN ADDITION WITH LEAKS ABOUT IT IS THAT WE SO CALLED ACTION DURING THE MEETING SO NOT ONLY WHERE WERE WE TALKING ABOUT THE TEAMS ARE WHERE WE KIND OF LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR WHAT WE THINK COULD BE BETTER BUT ALSO SAYING WHAT CAN WE DO AND SO THAT INCLUDED. BEING MORE INVOLVED IN COMMISSIONS BEING MORE INVOLVED IN GRANT BEING MORE INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING OF THE REGION AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE REGION PUBLICLY ON THAT WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT IT WITH A SENSE OF AGENCY A SENSE OF PRIDE A SENSE OF WE ARE CHOOSING TO BE HERE. NOT THAT WE ARE. KIND OF. JEFF ON THE ON THE AISLE LIARS OF MORE INNOVATIVE. AGENT REGIONS IN ADDITION I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER. CONVERSATIONS THAT WAS REALLY ELEVATED WAS BEING STRATEGIC ABOUT BRINING OUR CIRCLES AND EMPLOYMENT SO INSTEAD OF JUST. MAINTAINING SILOS AND THAT WAS ANOTHER MAJOR DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE SO MAKING SURE THAT. BRENT THAT WE ARE BRANCHING OUT AND HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH. DIFFERENT GENERATIONS MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE. MAKING A WHERE YOU KNOW THE POLICIES THE INITIATIVES THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATION IS WORKING ON AND NOT JUST KEEPING THAT WITHIN YOUR OWN SMALL GROUP GOES A VERY LONG WAY AND REALLY ELEVATING THE NARRATIVE OF WHAT OTHER REGIONAL WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THEN ALSO WHAT THE REGION BEGINS TO THINK ABOUT ITSELF AND THEN WHAT. PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OF THE REGIONAL AWFUL THING. AND I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN ACTUALLY PRIVILEGE TO DO WAS HAVE ONE ON ONE DISCUSSIONS WITH. PARTICIPANTS SO I REALLY WAS ABLE TO GET A BIT MORE GRANULAR AND THAT INFORMATION ONE THE THINGS THAT HAS ALSO COME THAT THAT HAS BEEN VERY VERY CLEAR IS THAT. DURING THESE LISTENING SESSIONS IT'S REALLY GREAT TO GET THIS INFORMATION AND WE WERE REALLY EXCITED TO DO AND TO SHARE IT WITH THE STATE AND WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT OUR RULE TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS BECAUSE IT REALLY. UNDER IT EIGHT IT SERVES THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE OF WHAT CALIFORNIA FORWARD IS DOING. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT USING A SINGULAR PRESCRIPTIVE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE OR FOR THE FOR THE INLAND REGION. TRULY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS SOMETHING THAT IS CONSIDERING. THAT IS DELIBERATE AND THAT IS REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE DIFFERENCES AND THE VARIANCES OF THE REGION VERSES. THE FOR EXAMPLE COASTAL REGIONS. THE REQUIREMENTS AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THE AND THEN REGION SPACE. OR EVEN THAT THE THAT THE COUNTY SPACE IF WE'RE BEING VERY SPECIFIC SAMPOERNA TINA VERSES RIVERSIDE COUNTY IS DIFFERENT AND SO IF WE'RE MAKING. RECOMMENDATIONS WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS IN MAKING SURE THAT. THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE COMING FROM THE STATE OR EVEN THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT. ARE EVEN BEING INVESTED OR DEVELOPED WITHIN THE REGION ARE VERY CONSIDERATE OF THE VARIATIONS WITHIN THE REGIONS WITHIN THE COUNTIES AND THE CAPACITY AND THEIR ABILITY TO. TO COMPLETE THAT ACTION. SO IT WAS. A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY. THAT WE SAW HIM OUT THERE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND DEVELOP AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO. CONTINUE TO TAKE THIS INFORMATION TO MOVE FORWARD ALL AS WERE LEADING UP TO THE SUMMIT SO WE'RE VERY VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. AND I JUST WANNA CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE IMPORTANT DATES AS YOU CAN SEE TODAY SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIFTH WE DO HAVE. A REGION'S RISE AGAIN MEETING IN YOUR SKILLS WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. ON OCTOBER THIRD WE'RE GOING TO BE IN BED. AND WE ARE. NOT FOR SEVEN SO WE'RE REALLY. LOOKING AT LIGHTNING SPEED UP UNTIL THE SUMMIT IN THIS. THE GOVERNOR WILL SPEAK IT TIME. IS AN INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT. AND WITH THE. READ IN ALSO MAKING THAT THE CLIENT TO EMMA AND STATE INTENT FOR WHAT THE- PLAN AND DEVELOP WILL BE FOR SPECIFIC. REGIONS BUT I DON'T WANT TO. LEAVE WITHOUT ALSO PRICING THAT. WE DEFINITELY REQUIRE WE DEPEND ON THE PARTNERSHIP OF THE NONPROFIT OF OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS TO REALLY DO THIS WORK SO AND OUR LEGISLATORS TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ARE DOING THIS WORK THAT WE'RE KEEPING YOU IN THE LOOP AND ALSO ARTICULATING WHAT IT IS WE NEED SO THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS WHEN THEY'RE BEING LEVERAGED. THEY CAN BE REINFORCED ON THE POLICY SETTING AGENDAS SO WE DEFINITELY SEE THIS IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AND WE ARE MOVING IT FORWARD. YOU KNOW THAT FAST AND FURIOUS ON UP INTO THE SOME IN AND THEN BEYOND. THANK YOU YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. IF YOU HAVE A MOMENT FOR A COUPLE QUESTIONS I DO I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON IT WHAT IS THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY THE CALIFORNIA FOR IT IS YOU SEE AN OFFER REGION'S RICE TOGETHER FOR SURE. SO AGAIN WITH OUR PARTNERSHIP FOR WE ARE REACHING OUT AND REALLY RELYING HEAVILY ON OUR PARTNERS ARE REGIONAL PARTIES TO. TO EXTEND THE STAKEHOLDERS AND SHARE THEIR NETWORKS WITH US IN ADDITION I AM AND I LIVE HERE SO I AM A GRADUATE OF YOU SEE OUR AND I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY ENCOURAGED TO HEAR. THE. WHAT DOCTOR OCCASIONALLY SING WISHING I FEEL LIKE YOU SEE OUR UNIVERSITIES LIKE THAT DEFINITELY GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO STAY TO BE AND TO BE THOUGHT LEADERS HERE SO. SO WE'RE USING THAT NETWORK WERE USING PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE FROM THE REGION WE'RE LOOKING FOR. FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE WHO WORK HERE WHO PLAY HERE IN JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT THE NEED. AN ADDITIONAL WE I AM FULLY AVAILABLE MY INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IF ANY IF THERE'S EVER ANY FEEDBACK BUT I'VE DEFINITELY ME STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO REACH OUT TO THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE WHO ARE OUR PARTNERS IN KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTICIPATING IN THESE. WELL I LIKE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO THE HIGHLANDER IS. A AS A FELLOW HIGHLANDER MYSELF.

HAVING REGIONAL REPRESENTATION AND EVEN. THE OUR ABILITY TO BE PRESIDENT AND BECAUSE INTO THAT THE TO THE BORN TO HEARING TODAY. REPRESENTS OUR ABILITY TO CONNECT GO BASE BECAUSE GO WITH DOES NOT EXIST. EVERYWHERE IN THE WAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE BY HOSTING THESE MEETINGS IN THESE QUÉ AND EVEN THE SORTS OF CONVENING IT ALLOWS THEM TO.

I BELIEVE THAT IT'S ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE AS CONVENERS ARE VERY INTENTIONAL AND TO WORK CONSTANTLY CHALLENGING OURSELVES TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE AND TO RECOGNIZE WHOSE VOICES ARE NOT BEING HEARD. AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE ARE ALL THE LEADERS IN THE ROOM I TO THINK ABOUT THAT AS WELL AS WE- ARE CONVENE AT DIFFERENT GROUPS DISCUSSING DIFFERENT ISSUES AND TOPICS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITIES.

CURRENTLY FUNDED THROUGH DECEMBER DINO COUNTY'S BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE WORK FORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY ACT THE INITIATIVE HAS DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY TO BUILD UNIQUE AND CONNECTIONS BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL YOUTH AND LOCAL BUSINESSES I ACTUALLY GOT TO TOUR THIS FIRST HAND. SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WHEN I WAS INVITED BY MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JAMES RAMOS WHO REPRESENTS THAT DISTRICT AND THE REGIONAL LEADERS AS WELL WHO INVITED US TO SEE FIRSTHAND I THIS INITIATIVE AND HOW POWERFUL CAN BE AND BRINGING THAT UP TO SCALE I MISS WILSHIRE PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK THE JEDI STAFF MEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AS WELL WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT AND TALKING ABOUT CHANGING THE NARRATIVE AROUND INNOVATION HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS REALLY A PROGRAM THAT'S DOING JUST THAT SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT WITH YOU ALL. AND THANK YOU AGAIN TO MADAM CHAIR FOR TAKING THAT TO WERE WITH US THAT WAS VERY EXCITING. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL SKIP A FEW SIGNS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TOLD I TEND TO TALK ON AND ON SO JUST. BEAR WITH ME HERE. SO SAN RENO COUNTY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. IS REALLY TAKING EIGHT OCTOBER WHICH DEVELOPING. AND RETAINING. OR SO RESPONSE TO INDUSTRY NEEDS. OKAY BROWN THE YOUTH PROGRAM UNDER SHOULD PATHWAYS IS ONE COMPONENT OF THAT OUR OTHER COMPONENTS OF FOCUSED ON SERVING AT SCHOOL USE THOSE THOSE AGES SIXTEEN TWENTY FOUR TODAY WE'LL BE TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HER CAREER PLEASE PROGRAM. WHICH FOCUSES ON IT PLEASE. SO AT THE HEART OF THIS INITIATIVE IS REALLY THE INTEGRATION OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS HAVE PRICKLY WORK INSIDE. TOGETHER AND EDUCATE INSISTED THAT INCLUDES K. TWELVE AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE WORK SYSTEM AND OUR INDUSTRY AND NO ONE SYSTEM THAT'S DESIGNED TO DEVELOP AND PRODUCE A SKILLED AND RELEVANT PIPING A FEW FOR TALENT. IN THE- EFFORT WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH OUR SCHOOL TRICKS WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND MISS THE COMMUNITY TO REALLY HONE OUR- HEATING ARGUES FOR THE FUTURE WORK. WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE. UP LET ME DESCRIBE THAT PROCESS SO A STUDENTS AS YOUNG AS KINDERGARTEN ARE ARE LEARNING HOW TO USE UP AND OPERATE THREE D. PRINTING PRINTERS THREE D. PRINTERS BY THE TIME THEY GET MIDDLE SCHOOL. THERE AFTER A CELL IN OUR THEIR WORK ON A WEBSITE. FOR ON THE AMERICA'S I LEFT I'M A LITTLE TOOK FROM CURTIS A MIDDLE SCHOOL IN SAN MARINO WHICH WAS ONE OF OUR STOPS IN ORDER TO WORK. AS A CONTINUE LEARNING THEIR CRAFT IN IN SCHOOL BY THE TIME THEY GET TO HIGH SCHOOL THAT'S WHERE THE WORKFORCE SYSTEM COMES INTO PLAY. DURING THEIR JUNIOR YEAR STUDENTS ARE COMPLETING A CAREER READINESS COURSE AND THAT'S REALLY TEACHING THEM THE SOFT SKILLS THAT EMPLOYERS AND WE'VE ALL HEARD ARE TELLING US THAT THEY NEED WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO SHOW UP ON TIME WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S DRESSED APPROPRIATELY WHO'S NOT GOING TO BE. SCROLLING ON FACEBOOK ALTHOUGH NOW I'M TOLD IT'S MORE INSTAGRAM THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS EVEN YOUNGER THAN MINE ARE NOT USING FACEBOOK ANYMORE IT'S INSTAGRAM. ARE SNAPCHAT WHATEVER IT MAYBE US A REALLY TEACHING THEM THE SOFT SKILLS THEY HAVE TO COMPLETE THAT COURSE WHICH IS TAUGHT BY A COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROFESSOR. PRIOR TO THEM BEING READY FOR AN INTERNSHIP PLACEMENT. OF WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR BUSINESSES ARE KEY SO THEREFORE WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE STUDENTS ARE PREPARED PRIOR TO THEM GOING INTO A AN OFF SITE WORK LOCATION. SO WHEN THEIR SENIOR YEAR THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE READY TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING THEY'RE GOING TO BE PLACED OUT IN A IN A BUSINESS OF THEIR CHOICE WITHIN A CAREER PATHWAY THAT THEY'D HAVE EXPERIENCE IN. AND THEIR COMPLETING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY HOURS OF INTERNSHIP WITH A LOCAL EMPLOYER. WHILE ALSO BEING CAN CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SO THE STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL NOT ONLY WITH THE DIPLOMA BUT WITH SOME COLLEGE CREDIT AND WORK EXPERIENCE ON THEIR RESUME. SOME OF THE TYPES OF PATHWAYS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PATHWAYS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ARE HEAVILY INVOLVED IN. HEALTH RELIGION IS AND ITS MANUFACTURING. SOME INITIAL THAT WE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH OUR SHOWN THERE LOGISTICS. A FAX TRAIN THE MEDICAL OR UP FASHION. OFFICE AND. SO CURRENTLY WE ARE STILL IN WHAT WORKS WHEN OUR PILOT PHASE BECAUSE WHILE OUR THREE YEAR AGO BEFORE COHORT IN OUR STATE BUT WE TRUST. SO WE PILOTED THIS PROGRAM WITHIN THE CITY OF SAN DINO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I AND COLTON JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE DECIDED TO START AND HEALTHCARE PRIMARILY BECAUSE- OF THE TEACHERS VOLUNTEERED. THIS CLASS SO WE'VE LEARNED REALLY ONLY ON THAT TEACHER AND IS CRUCIAL AS THE LINE BUT THE WORKING THESE STUDENTS GET EXCITED ABOUT THIS TYPE OF WORK AND IT IN EASY DECISION TO START THEIR AT WITH AN EARLY ADOPTER. HEALTHCARE IS ALSO ONE FIVE AREAS FOR THE BOARD ON AS IT'S A GROWING INDUSTRY HERE IN THE REGION. WE JUST STARTED HAD NO MEDICAL CENTER BECAUSE OF OUR PARTNER. WITH THEM WITH A PRE EXISTING. A REALLY NICE LIKE OTHERS WHO ARE GOING WITH. RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION NEED THAT I NEED TO GROW THERE. EASY EASY START THERE. THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THESE INTERNSHIPS PRIMARY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THEIR CAREER. HEARING CENTER A OF HAVE THROUGH THEIR K. TWELVE EDUCATION AND REALLY TRYING TO EXPOSE THEM EARLY ON TO THE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST HERE IN THE REGION THAT THEY THEY THEY DON'T NEED TO LEAVE WE HAVE HIGH SKILLED JOBS AVAILABLE WE HAVE AREAS FOR THEIR THEIR INTEREST RIGHT HERE. OVER TIME OTHER PARTNERS HAVE COME FORWARD WE WE'VE BRANCH OUT OUR LARGEST COHORT WAS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO STUDENTS. WHO COMPLETED A WORK EXPERIENCE THAT WAS WITHIN TWENTY DIFFERENT COUNTY DEPARTMENTS FOR BEING OKAY AND TWENTY PRIVATE BUSINESS OWNERS. AND SO. OVER TIME I HAS MENTIONED PARTNERS HAVE COME FORWARD AND I WOULD LIKE TO JUST AT LEAST ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF THOSE KEY PARTNERS ON IN THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY SIDE OF THINGS IS TO GARNER WHOLE PRODUCTIONS WHICH IS THE ANIMATRONICS MANUFACTURER BASED IN REDLANDS. AND IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST ADVOCATES FOR THESE FOR THIS INITIATIVE HERE HE MAKES YOU KNOW THE ANIMATRONICS THAT YOU SEE AT DISNEYLAND OR NOT VERY FAR IN THE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN VERY EXCITED TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE THOSE AND WHILE GARNER HOLE WAS TALKING TO THE STUDENTS YOU KNOW HE'S WHAT I HAVEN'T YOU SEEN OUR WORK IN AT DISNEYLAND AND MANY OF THE STUDENTS TO SAID. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO DISNEYLAND AND GARNER HOLE WAS YOU KNOW SHOCKED BY THAT BUT THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO ARE COMING FROM VERY. LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS WOULD GENERATE FACING GENERATIONS OF POVERTY AND SO HE DECIDED TO PAY FOR ALL THEIR STUDENTS AND TAKE THEM TO DISNEYLAND SO THAT THEY CAN SEE THEIR WORK SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I TALK ABOUT HOW. VITAL THAT THAT PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN. SO HOW DO WE REALLY DO THIS. OUT RELATIONSHIPS THAT'S THE KEY TO EVERYTHING RAINS OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE'VE TO REALLY BREAK DOWN BARRIERS AND BREAK DOWN SILOS. THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY HASN'T NECESSARILY. HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE BUSINESS STREET IN IT STORE ALL PERSPECTIVE. I'M SO BREAKING DOWN THOSE. THOSE YEARS AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN IT IS FINE. YOU KNOW. REALLY CHAMPIONS DOCTOR DEL MAR STAND. NOT SUPER. STAMINA CITY UNIFIED HAS INCREDIBLE AN EFFORT AS HE- TRULY BELIEVED THIS DEVELOPMENT. OUR FEET I FIND. IN OUR LOCAL. UP THEN I'M DIANE. RODRIGUEZ FROM SIMI VALLEY COLLEGES ANOTHER KEY PARTNER. AS WELL AS OUR WORKFORCE BOARD MEMBERS AND OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHO HAVE RECOGNIZE THAT MAYBE NOT EVERY STUDENT DREAMS OF BECOMING A COUNTY EMPLOYEE. AND WE AS A COUNTY ARE ALSO STRUGGLING WITH RECRUITMENT JUST LIKE OTHER BUSINESSES ARE IN THIS LOW IMPLANT UNEMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN AND SO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MADE A COMMITMENT TIMES THEMSELVES OF FINANCING INTERNSHIPS THERE AT THE COUNTY AND SO WE'RE VERY THANKFUL FOR THEM. YOU KNOW THIS IS AN EASY WORKING WE CONTINUE TO LEARN ABOUT OUR PARTNERS AND THEIR PERSPECTIVES. COMMUNICATION REALLY IS KEY SO WE STARTED IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE MOST OF THE STUDENTS ARE COMING FROM. VERY DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. I'M GONNA SKIP SOME OF THIS IS AN INTEREST OF TIME BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ONE OF THE KEY. INDICATORS OF SUCCESS FOR THIS WAS TO OUR PARTNERSHIP THE FOUNDING. FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I WANT PENSION NOT IS THAT WE- ACT WITH THAT WHEN WHAT YOU'RE CALLING CAREER CAP BECAUSE THEY SAY. UP THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO MAKING SOME OF THE SUCCESSFUL. THE BUSINESS IS OR HAS TO BRING UP. TURN ESPECIALLY SCHOOL KERN OF LIABILITY ISSUES WORKERS COMP AND THAT'S A HEAVY BURDEN TO CARRY PARTICULARLY FOR OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND WE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE ARE THE STUDENTS ARE ARE BEING PLACED WITH SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL AND SO BY CONTRACTING WITH CAREER CATALYSTS. THEY ACTUALLY CARRIED OUT THERE THE EMPLOYER OF RECORD AND SO THAT BURDEN HAS BEEN SHIFTED FROM THE EMPLOYER WHO'S PARTICIPATING OVER TO CATALYST. SO SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES OR OPPORTUNITIES AS I CALL THEM I'M MOVING FORWARD AS I'VE SAID. WHEN THEY WERE STILL EARLY ON AS WHERE TEST THE SYSTEM IN AND LEARNING FROM THEM. IT'S WORK BUT HASN'T WORKED OUT HOLD CAN BE MEANS WE DO FOR THAT SS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT'S IN IT WORK ON THEIR END UP THERE ARE THE THING IS THAT HAVE MOUNT. THAT. WE IN ORDER TO ROUTE MOVE THIS FORWARD WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. AND SO THAT IS YOU KNOW INDUSTRY BUYING WE JUST NEED TO GET IN FRONT OF CUBAN LEADER. IN A MORE DELIBERATE AND EFFECTIVE WAY FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE AREN'T STUDENTS COMING IN WHO. THEY HAVE TO BABYSIT BY GIVING THEM SOME FILING TO DO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THERE THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO THEY CAN TAKE BLOOD PRESSURE AND THEY CAN TAKE THE CHECK VITAL SIGNS THEY CAN ACTUALLY INTERACT WITH. WITH THE CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS IF THAT'S WHAT THAT BUSINESS NEEDS THEY CAN OPERATE MACHINERY. AND SO GETTING IT'S KIND OF A CHANGE IN MINDSET AROUND. AROUND EMPLOYING SOMEONE WHO MAYBE SEVENTEEN YOU KNOW EVEN AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD THEY'RE HESITANT TO BRING ON SO CHANGING THAT MINDSET AND ULTIMATELY. A HELPING THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THIS IS THE WAY OF THE FUTURE IF WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUR OUR TALENT LOCAL. AND REALLY THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO FIND EMPLOYEES YOU KNOW WE NEED TO GROW OUR OWN SO THAT'S REALLY KEY. FIRST INFORMACIÓN SAY WE YOU KNOW MY DEPARTMENT WE OPERATE UNDER THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT. THAT'S HOW WE'RE FUNDED FEDERALLY FUNDED UNDER THAT AND WE REALIZED EARLY ON. THAT THROUGH OUR FUNDING WE CAN'T NECESSARILY FUND THIS. BECAUSE WE STARTED WITH A CITY IN THE CITY OF SAN MARINO HAVE VERY HIGH POVERTY MOST OF THE STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE QUALIFY FOR FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH. BUT THEY'RE DOING SUCH AN AMAZING JOB THAT MOST OF THOSE STUDENTS DON'T MEET THE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS THAT ARE REQUIRED UNDER. WE UNDER OUR LAW BECAUSE THEY'RE STELLAR FRANK THEIR HIGH PERFORMING IN AND THEY'RE DOING GREAT THINGS AND THAT'S VERY EXCITING. BUT ALSO LIMITS US IN OUR ABILITY TO. TO SERVE THEM UNDER OUR UNDER OUR GRANT FUNDING AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THAT BUT EVEN EVEN. IF WE COULD OF FULLY FUND THIS IS UNDER AN OATH WITH WE AND IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH YOU KNOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW. THE WORK FOR SYSTEM IS A LOT LARGER THAN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OR THE BOARD YOU KNOW IT REALLY IS A COLLECTIVE EFFORT AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FROM YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY FROM OUR LEGISLATORS AT THE STATE LEVEL WHO MAYBE CAN HELP. DIRECT FUNDING INTO THIS TYPE OF WORK BUT ALSO FROM OUR INDUSTRIES WE'RE HOPING THAT OUR INDUSTRIES CAN RECOGNIZE THIS AND PUT FORWARD. SOME FUNDING THEMSELVES TO BRING ON THE STUDENTS. AND IT'S REALLY YOU KNOW. ASKING EVERY MEMBER IN THE SYSTEM TO REALLY RETHINK. HOW WE DO BUSINESS WE'RE DOING NOT AS A WORK FOR SYSTEM. RECOGNIZING THAT YOU KNOW WITH A LOW UNEMPLOYMENT WE YOU KNOW HOW ARE WE REALLY HELPING OUR BUSINESSES MEET THEIR NEEDS. BECOMING MORE RESPONSIVE. AND WE'RE HAVING REALLY. EARLY INDICATORS THAT POINT TO SUCCESS WITH THIS PROGRAM SO AND I LEFT A PACKET MADAM CHAIR FOR YOU. AND WILL MAKE THIS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL TO SHEET THAT SHOWS SOME OF OUR SUCCESS. IN EARLY ON AND SO. FROM A FROM A JUST A BROAD PERSPECTIVE ODYSSEY THAT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES FOR THESE PARTICIPANTS IS HIGHER THAN FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT PARTICIPATING. WERE SEEN LOWER ABSENTEE RATES. LOWER RATES OF SUSPENSION. AND ABOUT 50% OF THE INTERNS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED SO FAR ARE REMAINING IN PLAY. 86% OF THE PARTICIPANTS HAVE CONTINUED ON IN COLLEGE SO WE'RE SHOWING IN REALLY GREAT SUCCESS EARLY ON EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD SMALL COHORTS IS TO BEGIN WITH. AND I WANTED TO THIS POINT TO THIS PHOTO THAT I HAVE UP ON THE SCREEN HERE THIS IS LOUISE FROM INDIAN SPRINGS HIGH SCHOOL HE ACTUALLY JUST GRADUATED THIS PAST YEAR. AND HE WAS GOING TO BE HERE TODAY EIGHT TWO BECAUSE IT REALLY MEANS MORE COME FROM SOME. WHOSE EXPERIENCE SO HE CAN OFFER A PUBLIC COMMENT BUT HE TOLD ME HE THE MID TERM. AS I SAID WELL YOU KNOW SCHOOL FIRST I UNDERSTAND. THE NEXT TIME. THIS IS A PHOTO OF HIM ACTUALLY TESTIFYING BEFORE THE SENATE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THIS PAST SESSION AS WE- HAD A BUDGET REQUEST AND CARRIED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS. AND SO HE WAS SO EXCITED AND I CAN SAY THAT I THINK HIS TESTIMONY RANG TRUER THAN ANY OF THE REST OF US OUT THERE. BECAUSE HE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPACT THIS PROGRAM HAS HAD ON HIS LIFE HE WAS LEARNING ABOUT MANUFACTURING ADVANCED MANUFACTURING AND HAD AN INTERNSHIP WITH SORENSON ENGINEERING IN YOUR PAPER. THEY LOVED HIM SO MUCH THEY WANTED TO OFFER HIM A FULL TIME POSITION AND HE TURNED IT DOWN. BECAUSE HE WANTS TO GO AND HE IS OUT CAL POLY POMONA STUDYING ENGINEERING. AND SO HE'S WORKING THERE PART TIME. AND HE HOPES THAT YOU KNOW DO THAT FULL TIME IN THE SUMMER. ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THAT HE DID MENTION THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE BEST OF TESTIFYING. HE'S CONSIDERING A CHANGE OF PUBLIC AND TO POLITICAL. EITHER WAY RIGHT I DO TO SEE NEW THINGS COME FROM HIM. SO WHERE WE GO. OF THE LONG TERM HOPE FOR THIS IS THAT WE CAN TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM ACROSS THE COUNTY OTHERS THIRTY THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE COUNTY BUT THAT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF WORK AT THE GROUND LEVEL A LOT OF SUPPORT AND A LOT OF BY IN. AND SO IN ORDER TO DO THIS FOR GOING TO NEED TO ENGAGE ADDITIONAL PARTNERS IN THIS EFFORT WE NEED TO ENGAGE MORE CITIES YOU KNOW IT CITIES ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR EMPLOYEES JUST LIKE THE COUNTY WE'RE HOPING THAT THE BUY INTO THIS AS WELL. AS EMPLOYERS AND ALSO TO HELP GET OUT OF THE WORD TO THEIR TO THEIR BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THEIR CITY. HOW MANY TO ENGAGE MORE PRIVATE EMPLOYERS YOU KNOW THROUGH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE WE'RE SAYS HOW WE AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND WE LOOK AT GETTING AHEAD OF. THE COVERT READY. TO GO SOMEWHERE WE NEED SOME SUMMER PLACE THEM IN SOBRE TALK THE CHAMBERS. AMHERST STREETS ASSOCIATIONS. UP AND A CITY I MENTION. BUT I'M NOT EIGHT WE'RE LOOKING HOPEFULLY SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. THE MIX OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ON DOLLARS TO REALLY MAKE THIS THING EXPAND COMPLETE COUNTY WIDE BECAUSE WE THINK IN THAT IT CAN SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER AREAS AS WELL IT'S STILL EARLY ON BUT WAS HE INDICATOR SHOWING THAT IT CAN WORK. WE JUST NEED TO GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE TABLE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND I THINK IT'LL BE A SUCCESS SO I JUST WANT IS YOU KNOW THROUGH THIS EFFORT WE ARE REALLY RE ENVISIONING WHAT THE FUTURE OF THIS REGION COULD LOOK LIKE. BY CHANGING NOT ONLY THE TRAJECTORY OF THE STUDENT'S LIFE BUT REALLY TRANSFORMING HER COMMUNITY. MY DISRUPTING DECADES OF GENERATIONAL POVERTY SO I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR EXCITING WORK AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE PARTNERSHIP ABOUT ROUND THE FUTURE WORK IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND JUST IN THE INTEREST OF TIME WILL MOVE TO THE NEXT SPEAKER BUT MAYBE WE'LL DO QUESTIONS Q. NA AFTER ALL THREE SPEAKERS. I IF WE CAN HEAD TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER WE LIKE TO HEAR FROM DOCTOR ELSA MACIAS AUTHOR OF TOO BIG TO IGNORE LATINA MICRO BUSINESS OWNERS WHO WILL PROTECT KEY FINDINGS. AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REPORT SHE PREPARED FOR. AS WE KNOW AS I MENTIONED HE SPENT AS ORGANIZED FOR POLITICAL EQUALITY WITH THE BUSINESS OWNERSHIP AMONG LIKE THE NOW ENTREPRENEURS OUTPACING ALL OTHER BUSINESSES. BUSINESS OWNERSHIP GROUPS UNDERSTANDING THEIR NEEDS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO EVERY REGIONAL ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA. WE PROVIDED A LEAN TO HOPE. THE REPORT THAT IS IN THE COMMITTEE BACKGROUND REPORT NIGHT COURAGE EVERYONE A THIRD TIME. TO REVIEW THAT REPORT IN THE FIND DEAN'S DOCTOR MUSAEUS YOU CAN BE GOTTEN. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD MORNING TO EVERYONE THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE AND OTHER INSERT INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY. AT HOPE HAS PRODUCED A SERIES OF REPORTS ON THE ECONOMIC STATUS LETTING US IN CALIFORNIA AND SOME OF OUR FINDINGS ON MEDINA BUSINESS OWNERS IN PARTICULAR PROMPTED US. TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. SO AS MADAM CHAIRMAN YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT THE KNOWN BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE POSTED VERY IMPRESSIVE GROWTH BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. INCREASING BY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND FIRMS OR HUNDRED ELEVEN CENTS. THAT'S ALSO INDICATE NOT ONLY WITH THE GROWTH RATE A DOUBLE WITH. OFFER ALL UP BUSINESSES HOWEVER FIRMS TEND TO BE SMALLER COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE RIGHT NOT INCOME START LESS REVENUE AND MOST ARE WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES. OF MY BUSINESS IS ARE DEFINED AS SOUL FIRE SHIPS WITH MORE THAN FOUR. IN ABOUT EIGHTY NINE CENTS. ALL BUSINESSES ARE MICRO. COLLECTING OUT. A BUSINESS IS A BUSINESS WITH NO EMPLOYEE AND IT. USE LESS THAN FIVE YEARS OLD. SO ALL OF THE NUMBERS OF LATINO OWNED BUSINESSES ARE SURGING THE DESPAIR IN THE ACT AND YOUR NEWS FROM TWIN THEM AT OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS ARE SIGNIFICANT. SPECIAL WHEN YOU COMPARE WITH OUR AVERAGE USE FOR WHITE WOMEN BUSINESSES SO FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE BRIDGE I ADDED REVENUES FOR THAT THE NOW THIS IS ONE THOUSAND. JUST OVER FIFTY THOUSAND WHICH WERE WERE WHITE IT IS. IT'S TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND. SO THAT'S QUITE A- QUITE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CLOSE THAT. IN FACT LET THE OWNED MIKE THIS IS IT IN ASKED ME FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUES. WE DO BEING CORRECT. INDUSTRIES THAT ARE THAT GENERATE LESS REVENUE IS GENERALLY SO FOR EXAMPLE IN HAIR AND NAILS THERE ALSO AS I SAID EARLIER THERE TO TEND TO BE NEWER AND THEN THE OFTEN DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE TYPICAL AVENUES OF BUSINESS FINANCE SUCH AS CORPORATE CREDIT CARDS COMMERCIAL BANKING SERVICES AND LOANS. AND AS WE'LL SEE THERE ARE OTHER BARRIERS AT PLAY. SOONER IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY LATINOS BECOME BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND HOW THEY CAN BE BETTER SUPPORTED TO START WRAPPING AND GROW A BUSINESS WE CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUPS. LIKE YEAH MIKE THIS AUTHORS WHOSE ACTIVISTS REVENUES ARE YOU THAT. AND WHO HAVE NO EMPLOYEE. THESE WOMEN THAT WE CONVENE WERE COUNT TENSED ARTIST WHEN FORTY THERE'S JEWELERS DESIGNERS TRAVEL GEN PSYCHOLOGISTS DJ. DAMAGE IN FACT THE PICTURE YOU SEE. ARE THE GOAL SOME OF THE ACTUAL PART DEFENSE ALTHOUGH OF COURSE WE GRANT THEM CONFIDENTIALITY. ALL OF THESE WOMEN OF THOSE TO. COME FORWARD AND I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK MORE PUBLICLY ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES. WELL WE WEREN'T ABLE TO HOLD A FOCUS GROUP IN THE INLAND EMPIRE I DID INTERVIEW SEVERAL LIKE IN A BUSINESS OWNERS FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE IN A PREVIOUS STUDY. AND THEIR COMMENTS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED THIS REPORT. I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS FAIRLY QUICKLY BUT THE MAIN REASONS LETTING US TOLD US THEY BECAME BUSINESS OWNERS WAR AND- AND- BUILDING. THEM TO DECIDE CORRECTION BUSINESS TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL SIX THIRTY. I'M WITH ME. IN ABLE TO INTEGRATE PERSONAL COMMUNITY VALUES WITH THEIR BUSINESS VALUE AND THIS ONE WAS BRILLIANT. MANY MY MICHAEL THIS HONOR OUR FIELD I'M NEED IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND ADDITIONALLY THEY FEEL THIS RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROMOTING AND PRESERVING THEIR CULTURE SO THAT'S USUALLY VERY MUCH PART AND PARCEL OF THEIR BUSINESS AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEIR BUSINESS. MOST OF THE WOMEN WE SPOKE WITH HOWEVER DIDN'T. KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT. DOING THEIR BIT TEN ACCESSING CAPITAL WHICH WAY THEY WERE THE TWO GOALS FOR THEIR BUSINESSES. OR IF THEY WERE TO OVER TO THE DAY TO DAY. HEALTH OF KEEP THEIR BUSINESS IS OPEN. I. THIS IS GOING THEY'RE ALSO IN DOWN WE A FULL TIME. OR PART TIME JOB WHICH HAD FOR TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF THE PARENTS BECAUSE OF THE- ANTI. THE MONEY THAT IT BRINGS AND- THEIR TAKE IN. TYPICALLY PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHILDCARE IF THEY HAVE KIDS. ELDER CARE. I'M HOUSEHOLD DUTIES AND THAT AND THEY DIDN'T FEEL THEY HAD TIME TO PLAN FOR STRATEGIC GROWTH TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS SO OF TIME THAT GOAL THE GROWTH IS HAPPENING IN A. YOU KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT YOU KNOW AS IT COMES UP KIND OF A- IF YOU KNOW. THE OPPORTUNITY SB JUMP BACK TO FIGURE OUT MANY BY GINETTE FROM. FROM A MONTH ON THEIR GRANDMOTHER THEIR AUNT UNCLE WHATEVER SO IT'S NOT VERY STRATEGIC AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEN THE TIME ISSUES ARE EVEN EXACERBATED THAT WAY. OF LETTING A BUSINESS WOMAN WE SPOKE WITH SAID THAT THEY NEED MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE OUR BEST DEALS THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ROOMS ARE AVAILABLE HOW TO ACQUIRE TECHNICAL TRAINING THAT UNDERSTAND THAT THE. ACTUALLY EVERY WOMAN AND THAT INCLUDES EVEN OPEN THAT WE SPOKE. A COUPLE OF OTHER WOMEN WITH BACHELOR'S DEGREES IN PRETTY HEAVY OTHERWISE THEY ALL ALL FORTY FEELING. AND THEN IT FORMED HOW TO ACCESS CAPITAL SAMPLE BUSINESS PLANS CASH WEBER SHINS LÀ STATEMENTS AND THE DOCUMENTS THAT. FIVE OKAY IT'LL. ALSO ARE MORE LIKELY TO BUY. PARDON INSTEAD I SET UP. ROLE IS THAT PART ON EXTRA FIND THIS ROUTE. EVEN. EVEN WHEN THE WORKS THESE WOMEN WHO DID KNOW HOW THESE DOT MEN'S. OF THE WOMEN TOLD US THAT SHE GONE TO THE SBA WEBSITE AND WAS OVERWHELMED AGAIN THE WOMAN WITH THE NBA. FOR A LOT OF THE OTHER WOMEN THEY WERE BASICALLY YOU KNOW THEY'RE IN THE FOCUS GROUP GIVEN THIS INFORMATION WE'RE TRYING TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM AND HOW THEY FEEL AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A LEARNING OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM AS IT TURNS OUT. AND MOST OF THESE WOMEN ADDED ABSTAINED AFTER EACH OF THE FOCUS GROUP BECAUSE THEY ENDED UP LEARNING FROM THEIR PEERS AND SOMETIMES IT WAS JUST AS A SUPPORT GROUP AFTERWARDS JUST NOW SHARING SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS AND- ALL. SO WHEN THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND HELP THEY ALSO DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO TRACK ACROSS TOWN OR SIT THROUGH A LONG WORKSHOP THAT. THAT OFTEN DIDN'T QUITE MATCH THEIR NEEDS. WE HEARD THAT A LOT THAT YOU KNOW THIRD THE THEY JUST DIDN'T HAVE A DATE TO SPEND ON. ONE OR TWO OR THREE SESSIONS WHERE THEY WERE OVERWHELMED WITH INFORMATION THAT DIDN'T QUITE FIT BUT THEY WERE LOOKING AT OR WHERE THEIR OWN PARTICULAR KNOWLEDGE LEVELS WERE. ADDITIONALLY THE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT. JUST READ THAT I WAS A WOMAN ADDITIONALLY THE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT HOW LITTLE THEY UNDERSTOOD ABOUT MARKETING AND BRANDING HOW TO SET LONG TERM GOALS. USING SOCIAL MEDIA AND WHETHER TO OUT SOURCE WHEN THEY'RE REVENUES WERE LIMITED THEY GENERALLY. KNEW THAT THESE WERE IMPORTANT THINGS BUT THEY JUST REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THEM HOW TO CARRY THESE OUT. AND IF YOU KNOW DO I HAVE THE MONEY I MEAN OUTSOURCING IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR WOMEN WHO ARE USED TO JUST DOING EVERYTHING ON A SHOESTRING AND DOING IT ON THEIR OWN. AND NOW SOMEONE AND SAY HEY HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT SENDING OUT YOUR TAXES. THERE THE FIRST THOUGHT AS WELL I CAN'T AFFORD THAT. AND AGAIN EXACERBATING THE TIME CONSTRAINTS. THING TO OUR PARTICIPANTS BUSINESS OWNER IS OFF LONG AND LEAN MATING AND WOMEN ARE FOR MENTORS AND PIERCED I'M TO HELP BUILD A FINANCE FIRE THEM AND COUNTY I SALUTE. I CAN'T UNDERSCORE HOW IMPORTANT THIS ISSUE WHAT. EVERY SINGLE WOMAN CITED IN SOME WAY THIS ISSUE AS A PROP A PROBLEM FOR THEM THAT EVEN WHEN THEY ARE OUT THERE ARE GOING DOING SOMETHING TAKING RISKS. DOING THINGS THAT THEY NEVER IMAGINED THEMSELVES DOING IT IS STILL AT THE HEART VERY LONELY AND THEY REALLY REALLY NEED OF PEOPLE TO INSPIRE THEM ROLE MODELS PEOPLE TO HOLD THEIR HANDS AS THEY ARE GOING THROUGH THIS. SO OUR PARTICIPANTS GENERALLY EVERYONE SAID THAT AT THAT BEING A LATINA IS A PLUS TO THE SHARED LANGUAGE AND CULTURE WITH THEIR CLIENTS GIVES THEM. TRACK RETAINING THEM. UP THAT'S THERE WERE ALSO VERY EXPLICIT REFERENCES TO DISCRIMINATE AN INSECT SOME THAT THEY REGULARLY ENCOUNTER. SO IN PRACTICE THEY FELT THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK HARDER THAN THE THAN MAN BUT ALSO HARDER THAN WHITE WOMEN TO PROVE THEMSELVES COMPETENT AS BUSINESS WOMEN. TO GAIN THE TRUST OF POTENTIAL CLIENTS AND OF THE GATEKEEPERS TO COULD OPEN DOORS TO THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. I LOOKED IN THE BUSINESS WOMEN TOLD US THAT THEY FACE POLICY AND REGULATORY BARRIERS SUCH AS CITY RIGHT CHEN SAID FEEL ARE NOT A BUSINESS LATE. THEY ARE SELECT BEFORE OFFICE AND RETAIL SPACE I HAVE EXPRESSED A LOT CERTAIN P. ABOUT TAXES FEES OTHER. ISSUES UP INTERESTINGLY THOUGH ALTHOUGH EVERYONE HAD CONCERN IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT. GETTING UP TOWARDS YOUR- ARTICULATED MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT TAX ISN'T USED IT WAS MORE LIKE A LIGHT THIS IS IT WAS MORE OF THIS THIS IS A EXTEND CONCERN AND FEAR. MORE. THAN THE SPECIFICS ABOUT ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. SO WHY DO THESE FINDINGS MATTER WILL CONSIDER THAT LATINOS IN CALIFORNIA COULD POTENTIALLY AT FIFTY TWO THOUSAND YOU THIS IS IF THEY CONTINUE GROWING UP RIGHT TO HAVE BEEN. IN JANUARY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION FOR THE STATE'S ECONOMY. AND IF EVERYTHING ABOUT MICHAEL BUSINESS OWNER COULD EMPLOY JUST ONE PERSON OR JUST ONE PERSON. GOOD CREW THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND NEW JOBS. QUITE A. QUITE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE SUPPORT. IT'S A BASED ON OUR FINDINGS WE DEVELOP SOME POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP LET THE AS START RUNNING BROKE BUSINESSES. I'M IN OVER SEVEN LOOTED THESE WOMEN TOLD THAT THEY NEED STEP BY STEP GUIDE. THAT'S IF POSSIBLE MAN WHOSE FIGURATIVELY HOLDING HANDS REACH STEP. UGH THERE IS A GREATER NEED FOR INDIVIDUALIZED ASSISTANCE RATHER THAN WORK AND SEVEN. TOO MUCH PUBLIC POLICY CAN BE BEAR CAN BE BATES AND SCALABILITY FOR COST MEASURE IS INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED THE HELP THROUGH ONE ON ONE THING WITH THIS IS THAT. BUSINESS OWNER AT THEIR LEVEL. IT'S LESS EFFICIENT IT'S MORE CUMBERSOME AND CERTAINLY MORE EXPENSE. SHIPS WITHIN OVER TO THE SCHOOLS AT THE IN A SERVING COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WOULD HELP I THINK BUSINESS SKILLS AND I'M PREPARED PAUL PFEIFFER LÀ THEY NEED. AND FINALLY WITHOUT BETTER DATA IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE BETTER POLICY DECISIONS. OF ACCURATE BUSINESS DATA THAT IS GRANULAR ENOUGH IT'S HARD TO COME BY. A NEW SURVEY FROM THE US CENSUS BUREAU IS COMING OUT AND- IT'S IN THE FIELD NOW AND PROMISES TO PROVIDE DATA ON MICRO BUSINESSES SPECIFICALLY. PRIOR PREVIOUSLY I OF THE SAID AT THIS POINT IT'S BURIED THERE ARE YOU HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT VERY COMPLICATED. CALCULATIONS TO FIGURE OUT THE NUMBERS AND PERCENTAGES OF MICRO BUSINESSES AND IT'S JUST NOT GRANULAR IF YOU JUST WANT TO LOOK AT THE NOW. LET THE IN A MICRO BUSINESS OWNERS YOU JUST CAN'T GET A VERY GOOD FIGURE FOR THAT IN IN MANY AREAS. SO IT'S AND IT'S- ALSO UNCLEAR HOW IT'S GOING TO WILL IT WHETHER IT WILL ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THAT IN THIS AND OTHER WOMEN IN BUSINESS. AND THAT DATA WON'T INCLUDE THE QUALITATIVE THE QUALITATIVELY RICH TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT HELPS GIVE A FULLER PICTURE OF THE ISSUES THAT THESE WOMEN ARE FACING. SO LET ME KNOW ENTERPRENEURS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ROBUSTLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE INLAND EMPIRE CON. SUPPORTED BUT THE NIGHT MICHAEL BIZ OWNER IS ALL THE GOOD FOR THE REGION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELP FOR ME WITH YOU CAN ACCESS THE ROOM THE REPORT AT THE NEST ORDER. MEDINA MICRO IS AND FOR MORE INFORMATION YOU CAN REACH EITHER MYSELF OR MY UNCLE MYSELF GOT THESE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU DOCTOR MUSAEUS AND AGAIN JUST TO NOTE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSING HOME BASED BUSINESSES I WAS NOT ABLE TO JOIN US TODAY BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE A FOLLOW UP DISCUSSION ON THAT. I'D I WILL MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL SPEAKER BEFORE Q. NA BEGAN SIN THAT IS MATTHEW HORTON ARE WHO WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH WE HE WILL BE PRESENTING. FROM THE MILKEN INSTITUTE ON CD NOT REGIONAL COMPETITIVENESS AND BUILDING INNOVATIVE ECOSYSTEMS I BELIEVE THIS IS VERY EXCITING RESEARCH WHICH IS ALREADY IGNITING UPWARD MOBILITY ACTIVITIES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE MISTER HORTON WHEN YOU ARE READY TO BEGIN PLEASE DO. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND A IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE AND THANKS FOR CONVENING SUCH A IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. IT'S A IT'S LIKE I SAID IT'S AN ARE TO BE HERE AND TALK A BIT ABOUT THE MILK THIS TO WORK AND HOW IT RELATES TO THIS TOPIC WOULD HELP THIS TO FOR EVERYBODY WHO MAY NOT BE AWARE IS. A NONPARTISAN NONPROFIT AT FAULT THANK THANK. THE FOR INDIVIDUALS. TO OF OUR PRIMARY RESEARCH DOCUMENTS THAT WE DO ANNUALLY AND BI ANNUALLY. ARE GOOD INDICATIONS OF WHERE WE CAN BE MORE INTENTIONAL AROUND HUMAN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. ONE ON THE OUTPUT SIDE IS OUR BEST FOR ME CITIES METRICS. WHICH TAKES GET SOME THE GROUP IF I'M- WAGES AND HI TO DOCTOR A G. PEAS. THROUGHOUT THE AGENTS OF THE COUNTRY AND IT WAS OF HOW IT LOOKS LIKE FOR CALIFORNIA. WE SEE A NUMBER OF OUR CITIES RANKING PRETTY HIGH. ALTHOUGH. A LOT OF THOSE CITIES TEND TO BE MORE NOR. BUS AND READ ONLY WE'VE SEEN. OF THE RIVER SIDE MEMBERS AREA START TO SPORT. THIS METRIC WHICH WILL SEE IN A FEW MINUTES BY LOOKING AT SOME OF THE HIGHER PERFORMERS AND HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO LEVERAGE LOCAL AND REGION ASSETS IN THIS SENSE. IT IS NO SURPRISE US ABOUT EIGHT WITH THEIR TAX YOUR ENDEAVOR FIVE HI TECH ARE. OPPORTUNITIES IN THE AREA OUR STATE WILL GENERATE A NEW OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH INNOVATION AND FURTHER INVESTMENT YOU KNOW FOR THE SUSTAIN ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE FOR NOT JUST START UPS BUT OTHER OTHER BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE AREA FOR RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS. OUR ABILITY AS DR ROMER CHRISTIANS DATA WE POINTED TO EARLIER THIS THE LOOK. SIX PUB IS BASIS INNING AND PROMOTER. BUSINESS AT AND INNOVATION GROWTH IN THE AREA. WITH OUR PROXIMITY TO. MAJOR ONE IS SET. SOME OF THE INDICATIONS THERE ARE TO WORRY ABOUT ARE ARE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GROWING COST OF LIVING CONCERNS AND THE DISCONNECTED IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC VIABILITY THAT WERE SEEN BEING LEFT OUT ON THE INPUT SIDE WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATE TECH AND ON SCIENCE INDEX. AND HOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER PERFORMING IN TERMS OF ITS IN ITS IN HUMAN CAP. HIGHER PATIENTS SYSTEMS AND OTHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES AND WE TEND TO SCORE OR OR OR RANK PRETTY HIGH HERE BUT IT IT KIND OF BE LIES THE INDICATIONS THAT YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FINDING CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF COST OF LIVING UNTENABLE AND THOSE WHO CAN ARE. WHILE THOSE WHO ARE COMING IN TEND TO LOOK. UP THE- FOR IT'S OR PROFESSIONAL DEGREES UP PROBABLY IN THE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THE TECH CENTERS THAT WE START IN THE EARLIER SLIDE AGAIN JUST A SOME OF THE MIGRATION NUMBERS TO AND FROM CALIFORNIA. AND AGAIN OUR PERFORMANCE IN OUR BELIEVE HIS SEED REGIONAL INNOVATIONS AND TALENT HUBS ARE SO SHE WAS SOME OF THE JOBS THAT OFFER INCREASE IN GROWTH IN DEMAND. IS PIVOTAL IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO BE AT A REGIONAL. THE OVERALL CAPITAL INTO THIS FROM AN INVESTMENT STANDPOINT SHOWS HOW LIKE IN COMPARISON TO SOME STATES I'M AND WHERE WE HAVE ROOM FOR GROWTH AND WHAT REALLY THAT INVESTMENT SHOULD LOOK LIKE FROM A TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE WORKFORCE. AND WHAT THAT MEANS I'M UP AND INNOVATE FIVE ALSO WE LOOK AT THAT. LEFT GREEN ARROW AND HOW IT TRANSITIONS INTO THAT BLUE AERO THAT IT'S REALLY THE SOME OF THE KEY AREAS THAT RECEIVE OR STATE AND LOCAL OUR IN OUR FUND INDEED. OUR IDEAS TRADITION ROLE OR WAS A TRADITIONAL ROLE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF. SPENDING AND IT WAS WE NOTED ARE IN THE. AROUND SOME OF OUR KEY ASSETS EDUCATION IS THIS REALLY WHAT A LOT OF. ENERGY IF YOU WILL THAT KEEPS OF REGIONAL INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM VIBRANT GROWING. I'M HOW THAT TRANSLATES INTO TECH TRANSFER AND FURTHER PROVISION WAS UP REALLY CAPTURED IN A IN A TECHNOLOGY THE OR CONCEPT COMMERCIALIZATION REPORT DID IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE'S A REASON THAT YOU SEE ARE AND SOME OF OUR OTHER AND EDUCATION TO SHINS COULDN'T BE IN THIS OF RANKING INDEX WITHOUT WITH WITH THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS AND LEADERSHIP. AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THAT PRIVATE PENDING I'M PRIVATE INVESTMENT. DISTRIBUTION PROCESS STATE THE TEND TO LOOK AT HOW THE STATE BE MORE INTENSE WINTER OF BRIDGING THAT DIVIDE FOR HOLES AREN'T THE SPENDING. AND LOOKING TO BE MORE PLACED. AROUND SOMEWHERE EDUCATION IS TO. I'M AND IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE SOME SOME KEY STEPS NEXT UP FOR CONSIDERATION. AS WE GET YOU KNOW INTO THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE CYCLE IN ON. TESTING WHERE INVESTMENTS CAN BE. GROW AND OR OR OR MORE INTENT ALL AROUND ARE IN THE REGIONAL PARTNERSHIP ASPECT IT IS A KEY YOU'RE AN AT AND COMMUNITIES AND LEADERS ARE COMING TOGETHER TO TAKE A LOOK AT ASSETS AND DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS THAT THAT OUR INTENTIONAL AROUND REGIONAL INNOVATION. AND THE PLACE BASED INVESTMENTS AROUND LOWERING COSTS SO NOT JUST ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND STEM OPPORTUNITIES BUT MOBILITY AND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO INVITE SOME OF OUR COLLABORATORS THAT ARE ARE REALLY PROPELLING THESE REGIONAL INNOVATION COLLABORATIONS FORWARD AND AT A LATER DATE WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT. HOW THIS LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE OF WORK BUT IF TIME PERMITTING AND AS A FUNCTION PUBLIC COMMENT I'D LIKE. TO INVITE THEM TO GIVE A FEW REMARKS. THANK YOU MATT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS FRED WELTY. FOR A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS I WAS THE FOUNDING CEO THE LOS ANGELES CLEAN TECH AND. IN IT LED THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES EFFORTS. TO BUILD AN INNOVATION HUB FOCUS ON CLEAN TECHNOLOGY. WE BUILD IT FROM A GARAGE. ONE FIFTH THE SIZE OF THIS ROOM INTO A WORLD CLASS WORLD RENOWNED INNOVATION CENTER THAT TO DAY HAS DELIVERED JUST ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF LONG TERM ECONOMIC VALUE FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. TODAY I AM THE CEO OF THE NETWORK FOR GLOBAL INNOVATION A NONPROFIT THAT WHOSE MISSION IS TO DO EXACTLY WHAT WE DID IN LA FOR COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR OUR ORGANIZATION WAS HIRED BY THE RUSSIAN. A RIVERSIDE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. TO HELP CREATE. AND THEN IMPLEMENT A ROAD MAP. FOR CREATING A- INNOVATION DRIVEN ECONOMY ACROSS THIS AREA. WE HAVE A WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS WORK WE SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS FOUR MONTHS NOT IF IT SOMETIMES IT'S FELT LIKE FOUR YEARS MAINLY FOR MUCH. OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON WE'VE MET WITH OVER FIFTY OF DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING YOUR STAFF. IN I'D LIKE TO SHARE FIVE MUCH OF A COUPLE OF OUR KEY FINDINGS AND WITH THE IMPLICATIONS THOSE FINDINGS HALF FOR. OF THE FUTURE OF THIS AREA. I LIKE. MATIN CARDIGAN RUSH TO THE FOLKS OF SAID THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD THINGS HAPPENING A LOT OF REALLY GREAT INNOVATION PROGRAMS GOING ON. A LOT OF ACTIVITY. ALL THE REGION HAS ENJOYED. QUITE A BIT OF ECONOMIC SUCCESS. YET IT IS PRETTY MUCH UNKNOWN. OUTSIDE I MEAN IT THE INLAND EMPIRE IS KNOWN FOR CONGESTION AND SMOG IN TRAFFIC NOT INNOVATION. AND THAT IS A HURDLE IN ATTRACTING INNOVATORS TO THIS REGION. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE BIGGEST FINDING WAS IT'S LIKE A. A TRAIN COMING DOWN THE TRACK HEADING RIGHT AT US AND IT THIS TRAIN IS GOING TO ARRIVE HERE JUST AS CERTAINLY AS METRO TRAINS ARRIVE IN UNION STATION. AND THAT TRAINS COLD AUTOMATION. A OF PROFESSOR PROFESSOR MONEY IS FROM WRESTLING UNIVERSITY HAS DONE A REALLY TERRIFIC. PIECE OF RESEARCH THAT PAINTS IN VERY STARK TERMS WHAT'S IN STORE FOR THIS REGION UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING. AND HIS FINDINGS INDICATE THAT 63% OF ALL JOBS CURRENTLY IN THIS REGION ARE VULNERABLE TO AUTOMATION. IN THE NEXT TEN TWENTY YEARS. AND THAT WOULD MAKE THAT MAKES THIS REGION THE FOURTH MOST VULNERABLE REGION IN THE COUNTRY. FOR AUTOMATION. WHAT THAT MEANS IS TODAY THERE ARE ROUGHLY NINETY THOUSAND UNEMPLOYED FOLKS IN IN MULLIN EMPIRE. THAT WOULD GO TO ONE POINT TWO MILLION. WHEN TEN TO TWENTY YEARS THAT IS IN MY ESTIMATION THE SCARIEST THING I'VE COME ACROSS IN IN MY TIME IN TRYING TO BUILD INNOVATION SYSTEMS. SO OUR CONCLUSION IS THAT WE NEED A PLAN B. WE NEED A STRATEGY TO DEVELOP AND INNOVATION DRIVEN ECONOMY THAT OVER A PERIOD. TAKE PLACE AND REPLACE THE JOBS THAT WE ARE GOING TO LOSE THAT WE ARE LOSING NOW WE ALL KNOW THAT WE SEE THAT EVERY DAY. WE HAVE A PLAN TO DO THAT. THAT PLAN IS CALLED INNOVATION TWENTY THIRTY. IT'S A PLAN IT'S NOT THAT THAT IS BUILT ON TAKING AND BUILDING INNOVATION HUBS ACROSS THIS REGION. NEEDING THEM TOGETHER GETTING THEM TO WORK TOGETHER TO SHARE RESOURCES THE SHARE CUSTOMERS SURE INVESTMENTS YOU SHARE OPPORTUNITIES TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES. AND TO PUT THAT IN PLACE TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT'S BASED ON INNOVATION THAT WILL OUTLAST AND GET AHEAD OF THIS AND COMING PROBLEM. WE SHARE THAT PLAN WITH OVER FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS AS I MENTIONED. AND WITHOUT EXCEPTION. ALL FIFTY THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE HAVE EMBRACED ARE PLANT INFORMALLY OF COURSE. WHY. BECAUSE IT IS THE FIRST PLAN BUT NOT ONLY RECOGNIZES THE ELEPHANT THAT'S IN THE ROOM AUTOMATION AND HAS A VERY SPECIFIC PLAN OF ACTION TO ADDRESS THAT THAT IS REGION WIDE AND I BELIEVE. IT WILL. BENEFIT. EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS REGION FROM OF COURSE THE ENTREPRENEURS TO CREATE THE COMPANIES TO THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS THAT THAT HELP TRAIN RETRAIN OF SKILL THE TALENT FOR THOSE. COMPANIES TO THE COMMUNITIES IN CITIES THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM INCREASED TAXES FROM THOSE EFFORTS SO THAT WE BELIEVE LONG TERM DEBT IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO DEVELOP A NEW WAY OF DEVELOPING A INNOVATION DRIVEN ECONOMY AND THAT'S WHAT WE- INTEND TO DO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU FOR IT FOR SHARING. WE ALSO HAVE CHRIS WITH THE STUDENT. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRIS GRAHAM THE DIRECTOR OF PLANNING AND TRANSPORTATION FOR THE WEST RIVERSIDE COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS ARE WE'RE A REGIONAL AGENCY THAT REPRESENTS ALL THE CITIES IN WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY A NUMBER OF OTHER INSTITUTIONS I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU WHY WE CHOSE TO INVEST. SOME OF OUR RESOURCES INTO THE WORK AT FRED IS DOING AND WHAT IS SIMPLY COMES DOWN TO IS FOR THE PAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS WE'VE HAD THE SAME PATTERN OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WESTERNERS I COUNTY WHICH IS THERE ARE HIGH PAYING HIGH SKILL JOBS IN THE COAST LOW PAYING LOW SKILL JOBS HERE AND EVERY DAY THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO GET IN THEIR CARS SOME OF WHOM WERE LEAVING AT FOUR FIVE IN THE MORNING. THEY'RE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC TO GET TO ORANGE COUNTY SAN DIEGO AND LA AND THEY ARE COMING HOME AT THE END OF THE DAY I PERSONALLY DO THAT DRIVE FOR OVER TEN YEARS BEFORE I RELOCATED MY WORK TO RIVERSIDE AND I CAN TELL YOU IT'S A SOUL CRUSHING EXPERIENCE. AND PEOPLE ARE DOING THAT BECAUSE IT'S FUN THEY'RE NOT DOING IT BECAUSE THEY CAN LISTEN TO PODCASTS ARE DOING IT BECAUSE THOSE JOBS ARE THERE AND THE JOBS THEY NEED TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES ARE IN THOSE COASTAL REGIONS AND I WOULD SAY THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED FOR DECADES WE COMMISSIONED A STUDY LOOKING CUTE PATTERNS. WE FOUND THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN TWO THOUSAND AND WHO DROVE. THE COUNTY FOR WORK IS THE SAME AS TODAY AND WE'VE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS A REGION INVESTING IN FREEWAYS INVESTING IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DOES WHAT IT BASICALLY GETS PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE COUNTY FOR THEIR WORK SO THEREFORE WE THINK WE NEED TO GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND WITH THE HELP OF EXPERTS LIKE FRED PEOPLE LIKE MATT AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THE REGION. WE REALLY EMBRACE THIS IDEA OF WHAT WE CALL IT A NATION BECAUSE AND THE IDEAS THAT WE WANT TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOCAL OUT FOR NUMBERS LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS. AND PEOPLE WHO WHO WANT TO START A BUSINESS BUT MAYBE. OUR SYSTEM. GET IT GOING AND THEN DEVELOP WHERE THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. BUT WHAT IT REALLY NEEDS IS SOME LEVEL OF STATE ASSISTANCE AND WE BELIEVE THAT A MODEST INVESTMENT STATE RESOURCES. IN COMPARISON TO THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING VESTED IN TRANSPORTATION OTHER. AREAS CAN REALLY JUMP START THE INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING TO LEAVE THE COUNTY ON A DAILY BASIS. TO WORK I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THIS IS ADDITION TO WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT DEBORAH KERR WILL BE IN OF SPENDING A LOT OF OUR TIME AND RESOURCES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. NOT RECKON IT BACK OFF TO YOU TO CLOSE. THIS SEGMENT. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE EXTENSION OF DISCRETION THERE AND THANK YOU FOR. ALLOWING US TO PRESENT TODAY BUT THAT THAT THAT I'M I'M DONE WITH CONTENT AND I'M TRYING TO LOOK SMART FOR TODAY. THANK YOU MATT SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS OUT IN A MOMENT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENTS AND AGAIN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. ARE WE ASK THAT EACH PUBLIC COMMENT BE LIMITED TO THREE MINUTES MORE EXTENDED COMMENTS SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN WRITING. AT NEW DO HAVE UP UNTIL OCTOBER THIRTIETH TO SUBMIT YOUR COMMENTS IN WRITING TO THE JOBS COMMITTEE. I DO WANT TO JUST ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS SURE SPEAKERS BEFORE WE MOVED TO PUBLIC COMMENT. I AM ONE OF THEM BEING. IN THIS COULD ANYONE COULD ANSWER THIS. HOW CAN WE MAYBE PERHAPS LOOK AT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE THAT SUPPORT ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION WITHIN THE INLAND EMPIRE WORKING THE STATE DO WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A CHALLENGE WITH MAYBE NAVIGATING THE SBA WEBSITE YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT HE COMMERCE I JUST ANY TYPE OF MODIFICATION OF OUR OUR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO SUPPORT A MORE. UPWARD MOBILITY AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. ANY THOUGHTS. TO US YES SOME I WOULD I WOULD POINT BACK TO THAT ALREADY INVESTMENT MAP AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LEVERAGE STATE OR OR HOW WE CAN BETTER LEVERAGE STATE INCENTIVES THAT LIKE CALIFORNIA COMPETES OR OR OTHER SIMILAR STYLE INCENTIVES OR OR EVEN JUST OVER A PUBLIC SPENDING ON ARE IN THE AS A CATALYST FOR. REGIONAL INNOVATION GROWTH. AND GET A COMPETITIVENESS. AND WE HAVE DONE SOME WORK AROUND CALIFORNIA COMPETES OUT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL SESSIONS WHAT GOING BACK TO MISS WILSHIRE YOU HAD MENTIONED THE- INDUSTRY PRIVATE INDUSTRY THE BUY IN FROM THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY HOW DO YOU START WITH THAT ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE MAY BE OTHER FOLKS IN THE ROOM WHO JUST LEARNED ABOUT. GENERATION GO AND- UPS MAY BE CURIOUS WHAT IS WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU FIRST REACH OUT WHAT IS THE BEST METHOD OF REACHING OUT TO THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY. QUESTION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY SO WE ARE DEPARTMENT HAS A WHAT WE CALL REFER TO OUR BUSINESS SERVICES TEAM AND THERE REALLY ARE BOOTS ON THE GROUND FROM OUR ADDITIONAL INITIAL POINT OF CONTACT WITH OUR BUSINESSES. OF WHAT WE REALIZE THOUGH IS THAT SHE'S THE TEAM OF EIGHT OR SO AND THIS IS A VERY LARGE COUNTY AND SO RECOGNIZING WE REALLY NEED TO LEVERAGE OTHER PARTNERSHIPS IN ORDER TO GET IT OUR FOOT IN THE DOOR TO THE RIGHT. PEOPLE AND SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS TO MAKE IT OUR OUR BUSINESS OUR BOARD MEMBERS WHO ARE PRIVATE BUSINESS OWNERS THEMSELVES. AND REALLY GET OUR AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT BEFORE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION BMA OR CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE WE'VE BEEN PRESENTING AS WE GET READY TO LAUNCH AN AREA WE SET THE STAGE BY FIRST GOING ON HIM AND PRESENTING BEFORE. MEMBERS ALREADY WHAT WE REALIZE IS THAT THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY OF US AND THERE ARE A LOT OF BUSINESSES HERE TO KNOCK ON THEIR DOOR AND SO. TRYING TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY ALREADY ARE IS THAT ONE OF OUR KEY STRATEGIES BUT REALLY FOCUSING ON ARE ARE CHAMPIONS OF THIS EARLY ADOPTERS THOSE BUSINESSES WHO HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT IN. AND HAVING THEM TELL THE STORY IT'S OF MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL THE RATHER THAN IT COMING FROM SOMETIMES IF YOU IS A BUREAUCRAT KNOCKING ON THEIR DOOR. IF IT'S A SOMEBODY WHO'S IN OUR INDUSTRY WHO WHO UNDERSTANDS THEIR NEEDS AND THE DIFFICULTIES THAT MAY COME WITH BRING IT ON THIS TYPE OF IN A PROGRAM INTO THEIR INTO THEIR BUSINESS. I'M HERE DIRECTLY FROM THEM HAS HAD MUCH MORE IMPACT. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO BE LOW IS TO GO ON THE TWO FOUR AND TO SEE HIS ADVOCACY IN SACRAMENTO. I AND IN THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE FOR THE ENTIRE PANEL IS HOW CAN THE AYE EE. REALLY LEVERAGE THE ADVANTAGES OFFERED BY OUR DIVERSE POPULATIONS ACROSS OUR REGION. I'D LIKE TO JUST SAY. THERE'S SO MUCH FOCUS ON SMALL BUSINESS AND IT'S YOU KNOW CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE BUT- A LOT OF OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY MORE MICRO BUSINESSES JUST IN TERMS OF SHEER NUMBER AND IT'S INTERESTING IN MY RESEARCH THAT THERE ARE A LOT MORE FEWER RESOURCES THAT ARE DEVOTED. SPECIFICALLY FOR MICRO BUSINESSES AND INSTEAD OF FOR SMALL BUSINESSES SO YOU KNOW IT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING AND BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE RESOURCES THAT ARE DEVOTED SPECIFICALLY TO UNDERSTANDING HOW MICRO BUSINESSES CAN FLOURISH AND HOW THE NEWS CAN GET THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO BECOME MICRO BUSINESS OWNERS. SO IN THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY IN WHICH WE CAN SUPPORT THE KIND OF. DEMOGRAPHICS THAT WE SEE HERE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. THANK YOU DOCTOR MERCY IS AND I WAS JUST WE'RE JUST CHATTING WITH MY CHIEF CONSULTANT WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON MICRO BUSINESS OWNERS IN SACRAMENTO AND HAVE I MET WITH AN ORGANIZATION CAMEO THAT I. WILL WE WERE INVOLVED WITH EARLIER THIS YEAR OR TOWARD THE END OF THIS YEAR THIS SECTION BUT LOOK FOR TO SEE AN ENGAGING PERHAPS WE CAN HAVE A SEPARATE CONVERSATION. TO SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO FOR A PRO BUSINESS CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU. WHAT WITHOUT I WANTED JUST THANK EACH OF OUR PANEL I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW YOUR TIME IS VALUE DID. THE WORK THAT YOU DO IS A WHILE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR COMMITMENT TO OUR REGION AND MAKING SURE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO UPLIFT EVERY COMMUNITY I IN CALIFORNIA BUT LOOKING AT THOSE WHO ARE JUST FALLING FURTHER BEHIND IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. I'M SORRY PRESHEAF YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER IN YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE ISSUE. NEXT ITEM WE CAN GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENTS AND THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL LIKE TO BRING UP IS LOOSE GUIDE. MOOSE IS WITH THAT MORNING I HAVE TO START THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND SABRINA CERVANTES FOR ON FOR YOUR WORDS EARLIER I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT THERE HAS TO BE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND THAT A CAT HAS TO BE FROM THE GROUND UP IT HAS TO COME FROM THE GRASSROOTS AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OR STATE THAT IT CAN BE A TOP DOWN APPROACH. I'M HERE I'M REPRESENTING THOUGHT THEY BUT ALSO ARE A WE ARE A MEMBERSHIP BASED ORGANIZATION IN THE INLAND EMPIRE I'M NOT ONLY SERVING RIVERSIDE SABATINO BUT ALSO IMPERIAL COUNTIES AND AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BE SPACES IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE ON BRINGING IN OUR GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY OF BEING IN THE GRASSROOTS GIVES US A FEELING POLLS OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. AND AS WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION TO KEEP ON MOVING CALIFORNIA FORWARD THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE WE NEED TO BE PART OF THE SPACES AND I'M HAPPY THAT WE'RE INVITED TO BE HERE BUT I JUST WANT TO ELEVATE BECAUSE WE ARE OUT AS YOU ALL ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO US AS- RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA US US ORGANIZERS WERE ACCOUNTABLE TO COMMUNITY AND ELEVATING THE VOICES OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. AND REALLY HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE EYE IN THE PAST SO THE TALKING AND LEARNING FROM THE PAST SO WE CAN CONTINUE MOVING TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND MOVING CALIFORNIA OF HAVING TO CALIFORNIA FOR ALL I WANT TO ELEVATE SOMETHING THAT'S VERY RELEVANT TO WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM THE OTHER PANELISTS ADAM AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS IT AND WHAT NOT OF THAT YOU WERE WE WERE BACK THEN AND WHERE WE ARE NOW. AND WHAT IS VERY RELEVANT IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO BRING UP AND I BROUGHT IT UP IN ANOTHER SPACE I EARLIER THIS MONTH IS HOW. OUR COMMUNITY HAS SHIFTED ASSEMBLY WE HAVE DONE SOME GREAT OUR PROGRESS IN THE IT BUT THEN THERE'S SO MUCH TO LEARN AND THERE'S SO MUCH. TO DO. AND I WHY I WANT ALL OF ITS. ASTRID ON APPROACH THAT WE TOOK LAST MONTH WITH SOME OF OUR YOUTH NOT ONLY HERE RIVERSIDE BUT THROUGHOUT THE REGION. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE ARE THEY SAW THEIR GRANDPARENTS SAW THE AYE YOU BACK IN THE DAY. WE DID RIVERSIDE COUNTY WE WERE WE WHAT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF REAL COMMUNITY BUT WE WERE WE WERE VERY ROLE. AND AS OUR OUR GRANDPARENTS WERE ELEVATED THIS THIS WAS A STUDY THAT WE FOCUS GROUPS WITH THE FRONT OF A GROUP FROM SIX YEAR OLD TWO ELEVEN YEAR OLD. AND THE GRANDPARENTS AND PARENTS WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY USED TO BE FARMWORKERS. AND THIS IS THE DRIVE FROM THE STORIES THAT THE- RIGHT THE KIDS WERE LISTENING. FOR THE GRANDPARENTS AND PARENTS HELP DECIDE THE I. E. A LOT OF THEM WERE FARMWORKERS AND THEY LOVE THEY WERE VERY HAPPY. THE WE SEE THE ORANGE TREES AND WE SAW A VERY. HAPPY SON. BUT NOW THIS IS HOW OUR KIDS SEE THE I EAT. WE SEE WAREHOUSES. THAT'S REALLY WE SEE ALL THE TRAFFIC. ON THE GROUND. AND MORSE IMPORTANTLY WE CONTINUE SEEN HOW. ARE WE DO THIS THIS COMES IN WITH HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT AND HOW IT'S REALLY AFFECTING OUR CA AND COMMUNITY AND ALSO OUR ECONOMY. BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE. LOGISTICS AND EVERYTHING THAT'S COMING DOWN THE JOBS THAT WERE BRINGING INTO THE TO OUR COUNTY IS REALLY NOT THEY'RE NOT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY CIRCUIT COMMUNITY COULD BE THRIVING ECONOMIC. COMMUNITY SO I BRING THIS AS A COMMUNITY APPROACH WE WANT TO BE PART OF THESE CONTINUE BEING PART OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. ARE BUT ALSO TO CREATE A CONSCIOUS WITHIN ALL OF US HERE THAT HAVE THE POWER IN SIT IN THOSE SEATS. THAT WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE TO BE ON THE GROUND BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE KNOWS. MORE THAN WHAT ARE AT THAT SUFFERING OUR COMMUNITY THAT HAS TO HAVE TWO TO THREE JOBS IN ORDER TO MAKE MAKE ENDS MEET. SO I THINK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN I SABRINA FOR ALWAYS HOW IT HAD MAKING SURE THAT. THAT THEY HAS TO COME FROM THE GRASSROOTS AND I WANT TO CONTINUE ELEVATING THAT THAT. DOES HAVE TO COME FROM THE GRASSROOTS IT CANNOT BE A TOP DOWN APPROACH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH LOSE FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND JUST YOU KNOW I ALSO WANT TO GRADUATE THOUGH THAT FIRST. CELEBRATING THE THIRTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY. THIS IS PAST WEEK AND ALL THE EFFORTS JUNE OUR COMMUNITY. ACROSS BOTH REGIONS. ALL THE WAY FROM THE EASTERN SHALLOW VALLEY. TO THE WESTERN PART OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY THANK YOU LOOSE. NEXT WE HAVE MEDINA SOLANO. WITH MY DS STILL WITH US. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND WE'RE SO EXCITED TO BE HERE I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE NATIONAL AT THE IN A BUSINESS WOMAN ASSOCIATION WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE THAT. THAT THE LEGISLATIVE AREA IS LOOKING AT OUR LATINA AND HOW WE'RE DOING OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS AN ORGANIZATION IS TO EMPOWER LET THE NEST TO GROW THEIR BUSINESSES AND ASSN ORGANIZATION WE HAVE BEEN AROUND TWENTY YEARS STARTING IN LOS ANGELES. HERE IN THE I. E. WE CAME HERE FIVE YEARS AGO AND SO OUR FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAMS FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT MICHAEL BUSINESS COMMUNITY WE FOCUS ON OF A START UP SO WE HAVE THE EMERGING AT THE NEST PROGRAM AND IN A FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING FINANCIALS LEADERSHIP AND HOW TO ACT HIDE A CREATE IN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT'LL GROW AND CREATE JOBS. AND THEN WE HAVE FOR A MORE MATURE BUSINESSES WE HAVE THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT ACADEMY THAT FOCUSES ON THE SAME THING HOWEVER LOOKING NOW AT ORGANISED A BUSINESSES THAT. HAVE BEEN AROUND THREE YEARS PLUS. AND ARE LOOKING TO GROW AND SELL TO CORPORATE AMERICA OUR PUBLIC ENTITIES. SO AS AN ORGANIZATION WE CHAT WE SEE WERE CHALLENGED TO GET OUR OUR MICRO BUSINESSES ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TO THE TABLE FOR THE TRAININGS AND SOMEONE MENTIONED EARLIER THAT. THAT THAT DENIES IT THEY NOT ONLY DO THEY ARE THEY STARTING THESE THESE NEW BUSINESS SAYS BAD THEY'RE HOLDING A BUSINESS JOB. AND USUALLY THEY HAVE THEIR FAMILIES AND THEY ARE THE CEOS OF THEIR HOMES AS WELL. SO WE SEE THAT CHALLENGE HOWEVER YOU KNOW AS AN ORGANIZATION WE ALSO FOLK. WE ARE ALSO FOCUSING ON UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT MICHAEL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. MADE UP OF LATINAS NEEDS SO WE HAVE LAUNCHED THE STEADY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH UC RIVERSIDE AND THE SBA. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WHO ARE LETTING US HERE IN THE I. E. WHAT ARE THEY DOING WHAT THEY NEED AND WE ARE SO EXCITED. THAT WE'RE MEETING. WITH DOCTOR TODAY I AND. LOOKING AT HER STUDY THAT SHE HAS DONE FOR HOPE HOPE IS FOCUSING ON ALL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE AYE EE. OUR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH FUNDING FOR NONPROFITS IN THE I. E.

WE STRIVE TO BETTER THE LIVES OF ALL WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES OUR CONCERN FOR THE REGION IS ENSURING GOOD PAYING JOBS SAVE JOBS JOBS THAT WILL PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY AND MEMBERS WITH FORTY OUR GUARANTEED WORK WITH BENEFITS LIVABLE WAGES JOBS THAT WILL COST US LESS TIME ON THE FREEWAYS AND MORE TIME WITH OUR FAMILIES ALSO ENSURING THAT THESE LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE THE FIRST TO BENEFIT FROM IT THESE NEW JOB OPPORTUNITIES. IT IS OUR GOAL TO MAKE THIS REGION A PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK AND HOW DO WE DO THAT THROUGH APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS MAKING SURE THAT WHEN THEY'RE DONE WITH THAT PROGRAM THAT THEY DO HAVE A JOB WAITING FOR THEM FIGHTING FOR BETTER WAGES FOR HOME CARE PROVIDERS BECAUSE WE SEE THAT THERE IS A HUGE RISE FOR THAT AND THERE'S A GREAT NEED FOR THAT EXPECTING IN OUR REGION. AND TING ON IT. THE BOOK OVER AND SHE WAS WITH. THE ALLIES AND ELECTED IF. MUCH FOR ME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN FOR HAVING ME AND IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN SO MY NAME IS VERONICA WHAT I'M WITH THE WAREHOUSE WORKER RESOURCE CENTER SO THE WAREHOUSE WORKER RESOURCE CENTER IS A NONPROFIT FIVE OH ONE C. THREE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT'S BEEN HERE SINCE MY DAUGHTER WAS SIX MONTHS SHE JUST TURNED ELEVEN YEARS OLD OUR WE'VE BEEN DOING ADVOCACY WORK SPECIFICALLY WITH THE LOGISTICS INDUSTRY. I'M I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO GIVE YOU A BACKGROUND OF HEALTH THINGS WHERE WHEN I WAS JUST GETTING HERE. I REMEMBER SPEAKING TO WORKERS WHO HAD A HOME. WHO HAD A CAR NOTE WHOSE WIFE WAS ABLE TO STAY HOME AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR KIDS. IN BY THE TIME MY DAUGHTER WAS THREE THESE PEOPLE WERE LOSING THEIR HOME. THEY WERE LOSING THEIR CARS. PEOPLE'S HOMES WERE BEING SECTIONED OFF AND RENTED OUT IN SUBSECTIONS TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE RENT. BEFORE THE CRISIS. BEFORE THE- HOUSING BUBBLE. RIGHT JUST SO THAT THEY COULD STAY IN THEIR HOME AND CONNECTED TO THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY HAD LIVED IN. AND IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE CONDITIONS THAT THE WORKERS WERE FACING WAS NOT. AN ACCIDENT THIS WAS BY DESIGN SPECIFICALLY BY SOME OF THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS THAT WE KNOW OFF LIKE THE WALMART IN AMAZON'S OF THE WORLD. THAT HAD REALIZE HOW TO SUBCONTRACT HAD A TEMP OUT IN HOW TO CREATE PRECARIOUS WORKING CONDITIONS. THAT OUR COMMUNITY HE WOULD HAVE TO STRIVE TO HOLD ON TO SURVIVE. THE CONDITIONS THAT I. THAT I BEGAN TO NOTE BECAUSE WORKERS WALK INTO OUR OFFICE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS WHERE PRECARIOUS WORKING RELATIONSHIPS IN NATURE. DANGEROUS WHERE A HIGH HAZARD INDUSTRY SO WORK. FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST YEAR WE- SENATOR CONNIE LEVER WAS ABLE TO INTRODUCE AN INDOOR HEAT STANDARD. AND THAT TO ME THAT'S INSANE. RIGHT THAT WORKERS WOULD HAVE TO WORK INSIDE OF AN ON VENTILATED LOGISTICS FACILITY. WHERE THE DEGREES OUTSIDE WERE UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED DEGREES OF HAVING TO WORK INSIDE OF A CORRUGATED STEEL CONTAINER. WHOSE HE'D COULD REACH OVER ONE TWENTY DEGREES. AND HAVING TO STILL EXERT PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION AND STRAIN ON THEIR BODY. THEN HAVING TO GO HOME WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD AIR CONDITIONING. THESE ARE NOT. THESE ARE NOT ONE ONE INSTANCE THIS WAS THE THIS THIS IS A SYSTEM. OF WITH RAMPANT LEGAL VIOLATIONS WITH THE CLIMATE CRISIS UPON UPON US WHERE COMMUNITIES ARE CONSTANTLY BEING. CONTINUED TO BE HARMED CRIMINALIZING ARE POOR COMMUNITIES IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES PEOPLE OF COLOR COMMUNITIES. AND SO THE EROSION CONTINUES. SO TODAY I HEARD A LOT ABOUT HOW BUSINESS ARE CAN COME IN AND WATER HOW CAN WE CONTINUE TO GROW OUR IN. OUR INDUSTRY AND OUR REGION FOR THE POSITIVE. SO I JUST WANTED TO. THREE THREE RESPONSES AND YOU DIDN'T ASK ME BUT I WOULD LIKE TO CHIME IN. AND I DON'T KNOW IF I GOT THE QUESTION CORRECTLY BUT YOU AS PROFESSOR. ARE ROMAN CHRISTIAN ON WHAT COULD WE DO IN THE NEXT YEAR TO GAIN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THE RESPONSE WAS SOMETHING AROUND A PUBLIC DOLLARS FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT. BUT THAT CANNOT BE WITHOUT DEMANDING STANDARDS ALL OF THESE PUBLIC SUBSIDY DOLLARS. THIS MONEY BELONGS TO THE COMMUNITY AND ANY INVESTMENT ANY PUBLIC SUBSIDIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE GOING. TO PRIVATE AS MEN NEED TO COME ATTACHED WITH STAFF. UNDER THAT ARE GOING TO ELEVATE OUR COMMUNITY. THE SECOND ON A RESPONSE THAT I JUST WANT TO CHIME IN TO WAS BY MISS MOLLY WILSHIRE. ON WHEN SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGE AND ONE OF HER TECHNIQUES OF BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS AND SHE GAVE A VERY TOUCHING STORY ABOUT THE DISNEYLAND IN AND HOW GREAT IT WAS TO GIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO CHILDREN TO GO TO DISNEYLAND. BUT ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY WOULD BE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE IN NATURE THAT OUR PAIN LIVABLE WAGES THAT ARE SUPPORTING. THEIR EMPLOYEES WITH TOP WITH BENEFITS WITHOUT CAPACITY TO TAKE TIME OFF TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR KIDS SO THAT THEY'RE NOT RISKING BEING FIRED IF THEY DO TAKE TIME OFF TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR KIDS RIGHT AND THEN LASTLY THE QUESTION ON THE PHONE OR BEEN THE VULNERABILITIES THAT OUR- REGION IN PARTICULAR FACES WITH AUTOMATION. AND ONCE AGAIN THAT THE HOUSE WAS THAT A HEAVY INVESTMENT BE MADE FOR THESE TYPES OF GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT AND ONCE AGAIN AS LOSE HAD MENTIONED THIS CANNOT GO AND I CAN NOT RE ITERATE THIS ENOUGH THIS CANNOT HAPPEN WITHOUT TAKING THE COMMUNITY THE FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST THAT I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE IMPACTS OF THE LOGISTICS INDUSTRY WITHOUT TAKING THEM INTO ACCOUNT HAVING A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT COMMUNITY BENEFITS AGREEMENTS COULD LOOK LIKE WHEN COMMUNITY. IS REALLY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH RUN AGAIN YES WE DID HAVE A CONVERSATION YESTERDAY ON THESE ISSUES AND I WHICH IS WHY I DID INTRODUCE A I'VE BEEN AB ONE SEVENTY SIX THAT I MENTIONED DISCUSSING THE QUALITY OF JOBS. THAT WE ARE BRINGING TO OUR REGION AND THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE. I DO KNOW THERE HAS TO BE CRITERIA INVOLVED WITH THESE QUALITY OF JOBS AND THERE HAS TO BE. ACCOUNTABILITY IS WELL FOLLOW UP ONCE PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE RECEIVED AND SO AGAIN FOR ME IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE LOOKING OUT THE REPORTING OF WAGES I THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REPORTED. IN THE PAST TO CONTINUE TO GO ON REPORTED REQUIRING FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT. I SEE TOUCH ON A LOT OF IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT MY TEAM AND I HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING A WHEN IT COMES TO BE AN INTENTIONAL WITH OUR PUBLIC POLICY. AND SO AGAIN I A BELIEVER IN BRINGING POLICY FROM THE GROUND UP AND WORKING WITH AS SO MANY STAKEHOLDERS THAT WITNESS HE DIDN'T IN. FEELING THIS ON THE GROUND IN SO I APPRECIATE YOUR. I CHOOSE FAMILIES IN OUR REGION AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE ENGAGING ON THIS MATTER. WE HAVE OUR NEXT SPEAKER. HELLO MY NAME IS ERICA CAPTAIN WITH THE WAREHOUSE WORKER RESOURCE CENTER WHICH FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN SABRINA CERVANTES FOR HOLDING THIS MEETING AND ALLOWING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THESE ISSUES. SO I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT THE WAREHOUSE WORKER RESOURCE CENTER HAS RECENTLY TAKEN PART IN MOVING FORWARD LEGISLATION FOR EXAMPLE AB FIVE WAS JUST PASSED INTO LAW. REQUIRING CORPORATIONS TO CORRECTLY CLASSIFY WORKERS GIVING THEM THE WAGES AND BENEFITS THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT. IN ADDITION AB FORTY FIVE IS ANOTHER BILL THAT WE HAVE WORKED ON. A BILL TO BILL TRANSFERS TRANSPARENCY WITHIN. WHEN CORPORATIONS WAREHOUSE CORPORATIONS TAKE ON GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES. IN CITIES. AND THIS REQUIRES THEM TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT JOBS JOB TYPES WAGES AND BENEFITS AND- THE AVAILABILITY OF HIRING PROGRAMS. ON THINGS OF THAT NATURE. BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE KINDS OF NEW LEGISLATION'S THESE NEWLY BORN LINES. IT KIND OF SEEMS LIKE THE BARE MINIMUM THAT WE CAN BE DOING FOR WORKERS. CLASSIFYING WORKERS CORRECTLY ALLOWING WORKERS BREAKS WHEN THE HEAT EXCEEDS WORKING WORKABLE CONDITIONS. REQUIRING THAT WE KNOW WHAT CORPORATIONS WILL OFFER THE COMMUNITY WHEN THEY COME INTO THE COMMUNITY ON TAX BREAKS AND THESE KIND OF SEEN THIS KINDA SEEMS LIKE. THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE IN WHAT THE BARE MINIMUM WE CAN BE DOING. FOR WORKERS AND FOR OUR COMMUNITIES HAN. SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMPROVING THE REGION'S ECONOMY IT IS CRUCIAL THAT. WE REALIZE. THE PROCESS IS ALREADY IN PLACE HERE AND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT. THE NORTH AB FORTY FIVE WE KNOW THAT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO BUILD THIS KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY WITHIN CORPORATIONS BECAUSE ON A LOT OF THESE WAREHOUSES CONTRIBUTE TO THE BALLOONING LEVELS OF LOW WAGE AND LOW BENEFIT WORK ALREADY AVAILABLE HERE AND SO WHAT I HEARD A LOT EARLIER WAS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT AND NECESSITY OF NOT JUST FOCUSING ON WHAT IS BAD OR WHAT IS DAMAGED IN THE AREA AND KEEPING OUR MINDS ON THE- ON A VISION OF THE FUTURE THAT. WE DON'T WE HAVEN'T TAKEN THE STEPS TO BUILD YET AND SO I AGREE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT THINK OF THE REGION AS DAMAGED IN ANY WAY BUT ALSO. AS EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS REALIZING ALL THE WAYS THAT WORKERS HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED AND HAVE BEEN. PUSH DOWN. I THESE CORPORATIONS IN BY THESE BY THE LOGISTICS INJURES INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY. SO I THINK ALONG WITH THAT IF WE DON'T STOP TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THAT HISTORY AND HOW WORKERS HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED THEN WE CAN NEVER FULLY PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE FOR ALL THE ACCOUNT FOR. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THIS AREA AND MY HUSBAND ALLOWED TO BE DONE. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMPROVING THE FIT THE REGION'S ECONOMY IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE HAVE WORKERS ON BOARD IN THE CONVERSATIONS. LEADING THE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE POWERING THE INDUSTRIES THAT. NOW MAKE UP SO MUCH OF OUR REGION'S COMMERCE AND ECONOMY. AND SO MOVING FORWARD I THINK THAT. MOVING FORWARD ON THE BEST. PLAN TO IMPROVE THE REGION'S ECONOMY IN THE FUTURE I HOPE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE REMEMBER THAT THE WORKERS. ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ULTIMATELY. POWER THESE REGIONS AND HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BRUNT OF THE WORK AND SO NOTHING CAN BE DONE WITHOUT HAVING THEM ON BOARD AND HAVING THEM LEAD THESE CONVERSATIONS AND THINKING OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED TO FOLLOW IN ORDER TO BUILD A MORE ECHOED EQUITABLE FUTURE. AND I'LL JUST LEAVE ANA THANK YOU THANK HERE. AFTER NEXT SPEAKER WE HAVE RECEIVED GOLD CORD MIGHT GO COST CO AND JORDANA ONE. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ABOUT THIS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO ERICA SPOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ON THE STATE LEVEL TO PUSH POLICIES TO IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS FOR WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA ON THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OTHER LABOR ENVIRONMENTAL FAITH AND IMMIGRANT. JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS AS A IN THEM COALITION FOR SUSTAINABLE GOODS MOVEMENT IN ORDER TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE COMMUNITIES FACE TO THE INCREASINGLY DOMINANCE LOGISTICS CENTER SOME OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDE WITH THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. INLAND EMPOWERMENT AND THEN EMPIRE LABOR COUNCIL INLAND COALITION FOR IMMIGRANT JUSTICE IN THE CONGREGATIONS UNITED FOR CHANGE A TEAMSTERS LOCAL NINETEEN THIRTY TWO A SIERRA CLUB IS MY GENERATION CAMPAIGN AND OTHER SUPPORTERS. THE INLAND EMPIRE HAS BECOME DOMINATED BY THE LOGISTICS INDUSTRY WHERE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WORK AND LOCAL WAREHOUSES. AND THEY MOVE HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS A YEAR MOST OF THESE WORKERS AT THESE WAREHOUSES AND RESIDENTS LIVING FIVE IS WAREHOUSES HAVE NOT SEEN THE BENEFITS OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS OF THIS WORKFORCE ARE STUCK IN TEMPORARY JOBS THE MINIMUM WAGE AND COMMUNITIES HERE THESE WAREHOUSES READING SOME OF THE MOST CONTAMINATED AIR IN THE REGION. THIS SUMMER WE HAD EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY THAT SURPASS THE ROLES TENDERED. THAT'S WHY WE'VE TOGETHER TO THE MAN RESPONSIBLE AND. ACCOUNTABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OPERATE. OF THE MOVIE BUSINESS IN THE I. E. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE WORKING TO PUSH AS A STANDARD FOR THIS REGION IN ADDITION TO WORKERS RIGHTS SO WE NEED TO PUSH FOR GOOD JOBS AND GOOD JOB SHOULD NOT BE DEFINED BY JUST MAKING EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ENOUGH WORKERS NEED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THEY NEED ACCESS TO JOB TRAINING WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE HIRING LOCALLY WE NEED TO LIMIT OR IF NOT ALTOGETHER ELIMINATE THE USE OF STAFFING AGENCIES WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE AND ENFORCEABLE SAFETY PROGRAMS. WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY FOR SUBSIDIES ANY PRIVATE INVESTMENT RECEIVING PUBLIC FUNDS SHOULD BENEFIT THE COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED WE NEED A PUSH TOWARDS. ZERO MISSIONS OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE TO MOVE TOWARDS OUR OMISSIONS AND PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENTS WE NEED FUNDS FOR OF SOUND PROOFING AND AIR FILTERS. FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES MOST DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE LOGISTICS INTERESTS INDUSTRY AND THE INCREASING TRUCK TRAFFIC WE NEED ALSO A SIGNIFICANT FUNDS DIRECTED FOR IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVEST INTO SCHOOL AND SPECIFICALLY WE'VE AND WORKING ON GETTING A COMMUNITY BENEFITS AGREEMENT FOR THE SAN BERNADINO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT EXPANSION ALSO KNOWN AS THE EAST GATE LOGISTICS CENTER.

OF THE FORMER NORTON AIRFORCE BASE ENTERED INTO THE MASTER DISPOSITION AND DEVELOP AN AGREEMENT WITH HILL. TO CREATE WHAT IS KNOWN AS ALLIANCE CALIFORNIA WHICH MIMICS THEIR ALLIANCE TEXAS SINCE THEN HILL WOULD HAS DEVELOPED TWENTY SIX FACILITIES. IN AND NEAR SAN BERNARDINO BUT WE HAVE YET TO SEE THE COMMUNITY SHARE THE BENEFITS FROM THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN COMPARISON TO RIVERSIDE COUNTY OF THE STATE AND THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY HAS HIGHER LEVELS OF PARTY AT SEVENTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT. WHICH WAS MENTIONED IN THE- STATE OF THE WORK REPORT AND THESE RATES ARE HIGHER FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.
