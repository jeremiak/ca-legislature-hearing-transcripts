01:15:55.851 --> 01:16:01.189
PROPERTY TAX ARENA- AND I THINK

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:02.658
THAT WOULD BE OUR RANGE OF

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:04.026
EXPERIENCES THAT THEY HAVE THAT

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:06.395
THAT WHILE THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:07.729
DEEP LEVEL OF EXPERTISE. ONE

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:09.965
THAT WAS MY QUESTION AS TO MY

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:12.434
KNOWLEDGE I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF

EXPERTS. OKAY THANK YOU SIR OKAY

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:19.107

THEY'RE THERE TO PROVIDE THE

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:36.992
OVERSIGHT VERY DIFFERENT

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:39.428

TAXPAYERS DOLLARS. YOU WOULD

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:47.909

CONSOLIDATED THEIR OFFICES INTO

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:07.929
A STATE BUILDING SO THAT THERE

01:21:07.996 --> 01:21:09.497
WOULDN'T BE AN ADDITIONAL

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:12.567
EXPENDITURE- BUT INSTEAD THEY'RE

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:15.203
PAYING RENT OR OR LEASING SPACE

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.539
I'M ASSUMING IT'S PROBABLY SOME

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:19.374

WELL. IN THREE DIFFERENT

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.110
SEPARATE BUILDINGS IN A CITY

A FEW SPACES. AND SO I'M I'M

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:33.455
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY HASN'T

THIS WHY HASN'T ANYONE BEEN

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:37.092
CONSCIOUS WHY HAVEN'T ANY OF THE

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:39.194
BOARD MEMBERS WHO ARE VOTED BY

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:42.764

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:05.920
TO LEAVE SOMETHING FOR- PROBABLY

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:07.222
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN WHAT

THEY'RE PAYING NOW. IN THREE

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:10.759
DIFFERENT STEP IN THREE SEPARATE

01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:20.495
SECURITY REASONS BUT ALSO TO

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:21.930
MAKE SURE THAT WE RUN OUR NATION

01:23:21.996 --> 01:23:23.398
OF ANY BAGLEY KEENE. THAT WE

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:26.000
DIDN'T HAVE YOU KNOW MEMBERS

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:26.868
ABANDONING SHIP OTHER AND JUST

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:28.403
CHATTING THINGS AND OR THEIR

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:30.305
STAFF UNFORTUNATELY THE TIME WE

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:31.706
WERE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:34.109
WHILE THEY WERE A LOT OF A LOT.

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:36.378
OF STATE BUILDINGS AVAILABLE-

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:37.746
I'M TRYING TO LOCATE THOSE

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:38.747
WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:41.316
GENERAL SERVICES AND SOMETHING

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:42.717
THAT'S THAT FIT THE NEEDS FOR

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:50.492
THE BOARD. THERE STEP. AND OTHER

01:23:50.558 --> 01:23:51.292
RACIAL NEEDS THERE WEREN'T IN

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:53.428
THAT SUED SO OUR NEXT SIR WAS TO

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:55.263
JUST TAKE IT BACK OF THE NECK

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:57.198
BEST TO OPT WE DIDN'T SOME- SOME

01:23:57.265 --> 01:23:58.767
PRIVATE SECTOR LEASES BUT THERE

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:01.002
ARE FOUR WAS SIR TO INSURE THAT

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:02.103
WE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AS

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:04.305
POSSIBLE SO THERE ARE A NUMBER

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:04.739
OF THEM THAT REALLY

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:06.608
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SO WE HAD

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:09.344
FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE- ONE OF

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:11.546
THE OFFICES. THE PRIOR BOARD.

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:12.213
ONE MEMBER HAD THE ENTIRE

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.716
PHYSICAL SPACE. THAT WILL OFFICE

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:16.384
HAS BEEN SPLIT SO THAT TWO

01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:17.819
MEMBERS ARE OCCUPYING THAT SPACE

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.454
YOU KNOW WITHOUT WITH SOME SOME

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:20.922
MINOR CONSTRUCTION THAT WAS DONE

01:24:20.989 --> 01:24:22.056
ON IT. SO WE LOOK FOR EVERY

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:23.792
EFFICIENCY WITH THE INTENT OF

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:24.959
MAKING SURE THAT THE BOARD

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:26.961
MEMBERS OF THE BOARD MEMBERS

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:27.595
EXPRESSED THAT. FIND THE MOST

01:24:27.662 --> 01:24:28.663
COST EFFECTIVE WAY THAT WE

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:29.898
POSSIBLY CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:24:29.964 --> 01:24:31.900
WE'RE NOT EXCEEDING IT BUT THEY

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:33.935
ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE JUST FOR

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:34.536
COST EFFECTIVENESS WORKING THE

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:35.703
LEGISLATURE REGULATE. THAT THEY

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:37.505
HAVE CLOSE PROXIMITY ONTO THE

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:39.941
CAPITOL OFFICES SO- WE TRY TO DO

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:41.342
THAT ITCONSISTENT WITH ALSO

01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:43.445
SERVE FRANKLY WITH YOU HAVE MANY

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:45.046
OF THE RECONCILE STAFF. THAT

01:24:45.113 --> 01:24:46.681
WERE LOCATED IN THE SACRAMENTO

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:48.383
OFFICES WE TOOK INTO

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:49.484
CONSIDERATION ON ANY OTHER MOVES

01:24:49.551 --> 01:24:50.819
THAT WOULD HAVE MOVED THEM YOU

01:24:50.885 --> 01:24:51.986
KNOW WHAT HAD AN IMPACT FOR

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:53.855
STAFFING SO WAS ALSO. I'M SOME

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.723
THAT WAS SOME OF THE

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:57.625
CONSIDERATION WHETHER DOWNTOWN

01:24:57.692 --> 01:24:58.693
STAFFING. SO WE LOOK FOR THE

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.094
MOST. EFFECTIVE AND THERE'S BEEN

01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:02.130
A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OUR-

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:04.466
IN OUR LEASE COST AND PHYSICAL.

01:25:04.532 --> 01:25:06.301
WE ARE STILL PAYING RENT AT THE

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:08.269
END OF THE DAY AND YOU'RE STILL

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.405
LEASING FROM THREE DIFFERENT. UP

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:11.906
PRIVATE ENTITIES INSTEAD OF

01:25:11.973 --> 01:25:14.075
BEING LOCATED AT COLOCATED IN

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:16.578
THE STATE BUILDING- I STILL

01:25:16.644 --> 01:25:18.179
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY FIRST OF

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:21.449
ALL THE EVEN MOVED OUT OF- THE

01:25:21.516 --> 01:25:24.986
FOUR FIFTY BUILDING. WHEN THE

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:28.022
REST OF THE STAFF REMAIN THERE-

01:25:28.089 --> 01:25:29.591
EVEN WHAT IF THERE WERE

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:31.326
CHALLENGES WITH THE BUILDING.

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:33.928
WHY WOULD THE LEADERSHIP LEAVE

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:36.030
BUT THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE

01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:37.832
STAFF STAY BEHIND IN THE

01:25:37.899 --> 01:25:40.368
BUILDING IF THERE INDEED ARE

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:41.436
CHALLENGES WITH THE- WITH THE

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:43.137
BUILDING. AND FROM WHAT I

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:45.306
UNDERSTAND THERE WAS COMBUSTIBLE

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:46.374
FRACTURING AND THE WINDOWS WERE

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:48.510
SHATTERING NONE OF THE EXECUTIVE

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:50.578
LEVEL WINDOWS SHATTERED IT WAS-

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:52.814
EMPLOYEE LEVEL WINDOWS THAT WERE

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:54.616
SHATTERED. CARE TO COMMENT ON

01:25:54.682 --> 01:25:58.286
THAT. WHAT WHAT I THINK- IT IN

01:25:58.353 --> 01:25:59.153
THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WAS

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.122
HAPPENING AT THE TIME WE WERE

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.956
HAVING THE BUILDING ISSUES IT

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:03.358
WASN'T JUST THE BOARD MEMBERS

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:05.693
THAT MOVED OUT- THAT TO INCLUDED

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.128
A NUMBER OF STAFF THAT MOVED OUT

01:26:07.195 --> 01:26:10.298
BECAUSE WE HAD NOT JUST THE-

01:26:10.365 --> 01:26:12.267
BUILDING ISSUES WITH GLASS BUT

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.601
THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:16.271
KNOWN THAT- THAT MOLD ECCENTRIC

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:17.939
SATCHER. SO THERE WAS A

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.040
SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:20.808
ORGANIZATION THAT DID MOVE OUT

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:24.546
TO. A RITE AID LOCATIONS- I

01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:25.780
REMEMBER SITTING IN A NUMBER OF

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:27.715
MEETINGS AT THE TIME WHEN ONE OF

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:29.083
THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO

01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:30.852
CONSIDER WHAT THE BUILDING

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:31.452
INFRASTRUCTURE BILLION WEEKEND

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:32.820
AND CHALLENGED- SOME OF THE I

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:33.988
MEAN IT'S JUST SMALL THINGS FOR

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:35.857
EXAMPLE WHEN YOU HAD TO TAKE A

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:37.725
LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN

01:26:37.792 --> 01:26:39.227
THE BUILDING BASED UPON THE AGE

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:41.095
OF THE OF THE- THE ELEVATORS FOR

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:42.864
EXAMPLE. WHEN YOU TO MAKE SURE

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:44.666
THAT THAT WAS ON THERE WAS ONLY

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:46.801
SO MUCH TRAFFIC GOING UP AND

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:47.402
DOWN ELEVATORS THOSE ARE SMALL

01:26:47.468 --> 01:26:48.603
THINGS THAT SEEM INSIGNIFICANT

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:49.771
BUT WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:51.072
PERSONNEL AND BUILDING ISSUES

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:52.574
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE EXAMPLES

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.309
OF SOME OF THE ITEMS ON THE

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:55.276
TABLE SO IT WASN'T JUST THE

01:26:55.343 --> 01:26:57.478
BOARD MEMBERS THAT MOVED OUT

01:26:57.545 --> 01:26:58.112
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT- OTHERS

01:26:58.179 --> 01:27:00.248
THAT THAT MOVED OUT- IN FACT THE

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:03.284
BOARD MEMBERS WERE MOVED OUT. TO

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:05.053
BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE MORE OF

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:06.521
THE STAFF THAT NEEDED TO BE

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:08.189
PHYSICALLY IN THE BUILDING

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:10.191
STYLE- TOO MUCH BEST OF MY

01:27:10.258 --> 01:27:11.059
RECOLLECTION I DON'T BELIEVE IT

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:12.727
WAS THE BOARD'S GONNA WISH TO

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:13.962
MOVE OUT I THINK IT WAS JUST

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:15.830
PART OF THE DISCUSSION TO FREE

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.865
UP SOME SPACE. MISS ONE I DON'T

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:21.469
KNOW WHEN THE REST I WAS TOURING

01:27:21.536 --> 01:27:23.037
THAT BY TOWARD THAT BUILDING ON

01:27:23.104 --> 01:27:24.472
A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT OCCASIONS

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:26.074
AS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:28.276
AND FROM WHAT I REMEMBER VERY

01:27:28.343 --> 01:27:30.011
CLEARLY DISTINCTLY A LOT OF THE

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.412
STAFF WERE STILL IN THE BUILDING

01:27:31.479 --> 01:27:36.417
AND NOT HADN'T MOVED- BUT BUT-

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:38.186
YOU ALSO MENTIONED ABOUT BAGLEY

01:27:38.252 --> 01:27:41.222
KEENE. IF PORT FOR THE VIEWING

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:42.824
AUDIENCE I'D LIKE YOU TO EXPLAIN

01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:49.063
WHAT THAT IS. SO THAT UP SO THAT

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:51.065
I CAN GET TO MY QUESTION. SO IN

01:27:51.132 --> 01:27:52.634
JUST IN GENERAL HOW. SOME I

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:53.768
BASICALLY. IS THE- BILL STATUTE

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:56.070
OF ROLLS AROUND PUBLIC MEETINGS.

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:58.239
AND THE ISSUE AS RELATES TO

01:27:58.306 --> 01:28:00.408
BOARD MEMBERS IS THAT WHEN I'M

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:01.943
BORED MEMBERS COME TOGETHER AS A

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:04.379
LECTOR BODIES- THEY WANT TO MAKE

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:05.747
SURE THAT ANY DISCUSSIONS OR

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.882
DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE-

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:10.084
THAT WHICH- BE A PART OF THEIR-

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:12.020
OF THEIR AUTHORITY. THOSE

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:13.421
CONVERSATIONS DECISIONS AND

01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:15.423
ACTIONS THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE A

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:17.025
RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AND BE

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:17.859
EXPOSED TO THAT. SO WHAT YOU

01:28:17.925 --> 01:28:20.328
WANT TO DO UNDER THE BACK WE CAN

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:21.863
ROLL BACK WE CAN ACT IS TO MAKE

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:23.297
SURE. THAT BOARD MEMBERS HAVE

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:25.033
SOME DEGREE OF SEPARATION UNTIL

01:28:25.099 --> 01:28:26.701
THEY'RE IN THE PUBLIC MEETINGS.

01:28:26.768 --> 01:28:28.069
AND SO WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:30.071
IN A PUBLIC MEETINGS AND ITEMS

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:30.872
ARE PUT THE AGENDAS ARE

01:28:30.938 --> 01:28:32.340
PUBLISHED THE PUBLIC IS INVITED

01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:33.875
TO PARTICIPATE. I HAVE FULL

01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:36.144
ACCESS TO ANY OF THE ACTIONS ARE

01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:37.111
THE DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE

01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:37.979
OCCURRING. THE CONCERN IS THAT

01:28:38.046 --> 01:28:39.947
IF YOU HAVE THEM AND SOME OF THE

01:28:40.014 --> 01:28:42.216
ISSUES THAT WE YOU KNOW TO. TAKE

01:28:42.283 --> 01:28:43.117
CAUTION WITH BEFORE WHEN THEY'RE

01:28:43.184 --> 01:28:45.386
ALL CALL LOCATED IN A BUILDING.

01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:46.788
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS

01:28:46.854 --> 01:28:47.955
RAISED BY LEGAL IT'S JUST THE

01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:49.524
SENSITIVITY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:50.324
THEY'RE NOT CO MINGLING

01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:51.859
SOMEPLACE. AND POTENTIALLY

01:28:51.926 --> 01:28:53.728
HAVING A CONVERSATION THAT SOME

01:28:53.795 --> 01:28:55.430
COULD CONSIDER IS LIKE HEY OUR

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:56.831
HIGHLANDER THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:57.965
NOT. HAVING AN EXCHANGE OF

01:28:58.032 --> 01:28:58.866
INFORMATION OR DISCUSSING

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:00.001
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE

01:29:00.068 --> 01:29:05.006
PUBLICLY. TO USE. THAT THIS

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:06.407
FUNDING DO YOU HAVE THAT LEGAL

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:08.276
DOCUMENT. I HAVE IT IN FRONT

01:29:08.342 --> 01:29:10.645
HAVE THAT OPINION AVAILABLE- I

01:29:10.712 --> 01:29:12.413
COULD WORK WITH AFTER TO

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.148
RETRIEVE INFORMATION I WANT TO

01:29:14.215 --> 01:29:15.783
SEE THE ORIGINAL ONE NOT NOTHING

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:17.685
NEW I WANT TO SEE THE ORIGINAL

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:19.520
BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN

01:29:19.587 --> 01:29:20.855
I THINK. I I'M WONDERING IF

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:21.789
WE'RE BREAKING ANY LAWS BY

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:23.825
HAVING EIGHTY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

01:29:23.891 --> 01:29:27.995
IN THE SAME BUILDING. I CAN TAKE

01:29:28.062 --> 01:29:29.097
A LOOK WHAT'S THERE SO MY

01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:30.765
EXPERIENCE WITH THE BOARD AS I

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.600
SAY HAS BEEN QUITE AWHILE SINCE

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:34.769
TWENTY ELEVEN. SOME OF THOSE-

01:29:34.836 --> 01:29:36.270
HERE BUT I'LL CERTAINLY BE HAPPY

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:38.506
TO GO BACK AND WORK WITH LEGAL

01:29:38.573 --> 01:29:40.308
SEE WHAT WE COULD RETREAT FOR

01:29:40.374 --> 01:29:41.876
YOU. IS A PART OF HISTORIC

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:44.178
MATERIAL. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT

01:29:44.245 --> 01:29:47.648
BASED ON SOME A LEGAL OPINION

OPERATIONALIZE THIS. AND THAT

01:45:35.962 --> 01:45:37.864
WOULD INCLUDE OUTREACH UNDER OUR

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:39.332
FEDERAL LAWS THAT PROHIBIT THE

01:45:39.399 --> 01:45:41.201
DISCLOSURE OF THE NAMES OF THESE

01:45:41.268 --> 01:45:43.670
INDIVIDUALS. SO I HAVE TO BE

DEFINITELY GOING TO BE

01:45:55.515 --> 01:45:57.117
LEVERAGING THEM TO MAKE SURE

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:58.585
THAT THEY'RE HELPING US-

01:45:58.652 --> 01:46:00.053
ADVOCATE THAT THESE PROPOSALS.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:02.456
EXISTS TO BEACH COSTS ARE YOU.

01:46:02.522 --> 01:46:04.157
ON AND THAT HOW THEY CAN TAKE

01:46:04.224 --> 01:46:06.093
ADVANTAGE OF IT SO- THAT IS

01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:07.828
DEFINITELY A KEY STRATEGY THAT

01:46:07.894 --> 01:46:09.429
WILL BE DURING THIS YEAR. LONDON

01:46:09.496 --> 01:46:11.631
STRENGTHENING FOUR ZERO INCOME

01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:13.300
INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL BE

01:46:13.366 --> 01:46:14.534
ELIGIBLE POTENTIALLY FOR THE

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:16.103
FIRST TIME THAT THE SMALLER TO

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:18.038
BE INDUCTED. I'M FOR THE MOST

01:46:18.105 --> 01:46:19.372
PART THOSE ARE INVISIBLE

01:46:19.439 --> 01:46:21.141
INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE TO BE ON

01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:22.776
BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE

01:46:22.843 --> 01:46:24.811
INCOME STREAM. THAT COMES INTO A

01:46:24.878 --> 01:46:27.147
SUCH AS WAGES WHICH IS THE MOST-

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:28.849
CREDIBLE WAY THAT WE CAN

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:30.917
IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:33.386
NOT TO BE I'M SITTING AND

01:46:33.453 --> 01:46:34.721

HAPPEN MORE ALSO REACHING OUT.

01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:38.525
TO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES

01:46:38.592 --> 01:46:39.760
AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:41.995
SERVICES. TO SEE IF WE CAN

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:43.163
UNDERSTAND SOME OF THEIR

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:45.232
POPULATIONS THAT MIGHT FALL INTO

01:46:45.298 --> 01:46:47.701
THIS GROUP. AND THEN ONE OF US

01:46:47.768 --> 01:46:49.202
FROM THOSE RESPECTIVE THREE

01:46:49.269 --> 01:46:51.404
AGENCIES REACHING OUT TO THOSE

01:46:51.471 --> 01:46:53.206
FOLKS AT THAT POINT AS WELL.

01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:55.308
AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THERE WERE

01:46:55.375 --> 01:46:57.911
CUT ITS EXISTENCE- MAKE SURE

01:46:57.978 --> 01:46:59.579
THERE WERE FEDERAL CREDIT I

01:46:59.646 --> 01:47:01.148
THINK IT ALSO QUITE FOR. AND

01:47:01.214 --> 01:47:03.416
THEN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

01:47:03.483 --> 01:47:05.252
AWARE OF HOW TO ENGAGE THREE TAX

01:47:05.318 --> 01:47:08.522
PREPARATION SERVICE. VITA IN THE

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:16.029
EVENT THAT THE SERVICES. RUNNING

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:17.864
OUT. HERE REACHED OUT TO. SO I'M

01:47:17.931 --> 01:47:19.866
WITH I DON'T HAVE ANSWER OTHER

01:47:19.933 --> 01:47:20.600
SPECIFIC QUESTION YOU LET OUT.

01:47:20.667 --> 01:47:23.837
IN ALL- ON BACKSHEET THANK YOU.

01:47:23.904 --> 01:47:25.205
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MUCH

01:47:25.272 --> 01:47:27.274

01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:29.109
THE ROOM. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM

01:47:29.176 --> 01:47:30.877
CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

01:47:30.944 --> 01:47:32.012
ALYSSA ANDERSON WITH THE

01:47:32.078 --> 01:47:33.313
CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:34.681
CENTER AND APPRECIATE THE

01:47:34.748 --> 01:47:36.583
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY-

01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:37.851
FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO COMMEND

01:47:37.918 --> 01:47:39.619
THE ADMINISTRATION FOR PROPOSING

01:47:39.686 --> 01:47:41.121
TO AND EARNINGS REQUIREMENT FOR

01:47:41.188 --> 01:47:41.922
CALIFORNIA'S YOUNG CHILD TAX

01:47:41.988 --> 01:47:44.191
CREDIT. THIS WILL HELP MORE

01:47:44.257 --> 01:47:45.258
FAMILIES WHO ARE WORKING HARD TO

01:47:45.325 --> 01:47:46.726
RAISE THEIR CHILDREN MEET BASIC

01:47:46.793 --> 01:47:48.795
NEEDS AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY

01:47:48.862 --> 01:47:50.530
CRITICAL NOW THAT THESE FAMILIES

01:47:50.597 --> 01:47:52.899
WILL BE DENIED THE FEDERAL CHILD

01:47:52.966 --> 01:47:54.301
TAX CREDIT. BUT INCLUDING THESE

01:47:54.367 --> 01:47:55.635
FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA'S CREDIT

01:47:55.702 --> 01:47:57.771
IS JUST THE FIRST STEP. THE NEXT

01:47:57.838 --> 01:47:58.939
STEP IS MAKING SURE THOSE

01:47:59.005 --> 01:48:00.040
FAMILIES ACTUALLY GET THE

01:48:00.106 --> 01:48:02.542
CREDIT. THE CHALLENGES THESE

01:48:02.609 --> 01:48:03.443
FAMILIES ARE REQUIRED TO FILE

01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:05.712
TAXES. SO WHAT'S NEEDED TO HELP

01:48:05.779 --> 01:48:07.647
FAMILIES GET THE CREDIT. FIRST

01:48:07.714 --> 01:48:09.516
MORE FUNDING AND CONSISTENT

01:48:09.583 --> 01:48:10.550
FUNDING TO COMMUNITY BASED

01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:12.285
ORGANIZATIONS AND FREE TAX PREP

01:48:12.352 --> 01:48:14.054
SITES BECAUSE IT'S CRITICAL THAT

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.455
FAMILIES LEARN ABOUT THE CREDIT

01:48:15.522 --> 01:48:17.924
THROUGH TRUSTED MESSENGERS. WHO

01:48:17.991 --> 01:48:19.159
CAN HELP THEM CLAIM THE CREDIT

01:48:19.226 --> 01:48:21.161
FOR FREE. MORE FREE TAX PREP

01:48:21.228 --> 01:48:22.829
MEANS MORE MONEY INTO FAMILIES

01:48:22.896 --> 01:48:24.030
POCKETS AND MORE OF WHAT

01:48:24.097 --> 01:48:24.965
CALIFORNIA SPENT ON TAX CREDITS

01:48:25.031 --> 01:48:26.933
GOING TO FAMILIES INSTEAD OF FOR

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.469
PROFIT TAX PREPARERS. A SECOND

01:48:29.536 --> 01:48:30.770
WAY CALIFORNIA CAN HELP FAMILIES

01:48:30.837 --> 01:48:32.305
GET THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT

01:48:32.372 --> 01:48:33.807
IS BY MAKING A SIMPLE CHANGE IN

01:48:33.874 --> 01:48:35.809
STATUTE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE

01:48:35.876 --> 01:48:36.877
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES

01:48:36.943 --> 01:48:38.044
AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

01:48:38.111 --> 01:48:39.546
SERVICES. TO IDENTIFY THE

01:48:39.613 --> 01:48:41.147
SPECIFIC FAMILIES ENROLLED IN

01:48:41.214 --> 01:48:43.016
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS WHO ARE AT

01:48:43.083 --> 01:48:44.918
RISK OF MISSING OUT ON THE

01:48:44.985 --> 01:48:46.653
CREDIT BECAUSE THEY DON'T FILE

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:47.954
TAXES. THEN THE DEPARTMENTS

01:48:48.021 --> 01:48:48.555
COULD CONNECT THESE FAMILIES

01:48:48.622 --> 01:48:50.824
WITH FREE FILING RESOURCES. THIS

01:48:50.891 --> 01:48:52.025
COULD REACH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:48:52.092 --> 01:48:53.693
CHILDREN WHO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.795
THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT UNDER

01:48:55.862 --> 01:48:57.297
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. DSS

01:48:57.364 --> 01:48:58.798
RECENTLY CONDUCTED A SIMILAR

01:48:58.865 --> 01:49:00.200
EFFORT AROUND FEDERAL STIMULUS

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:01.835
PAYMENTS THAT'S BEING EVALUATED

01:49:01.902 --> 01:49:03.503
BY THE CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB IN

01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:05.138
THE PEOPLE LAB TO SEE WHICH

01:49:05.205 --> 01:49:06.206
OUTREACH STRATEGIES ARE MOST

01:49:06.273 --> 01:49:08.108
EFFECTIVE. AND THAT COULD INFORM

01:49:08.174 --> 01:49:10.143
HOW BEST TO REACH FAMILIES WHO

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:11.344
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE YOUNG CHILD

01:49:11.411 --> 01:49:13.213
TAX CREDIT. ANOTHER IDEA FROM

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:15.081
CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB IS FOR

01:49:15.148 --> 01:49:16.316
COUNTIES TO HELP DETERMINE

01:49:16.383 --> 01:49:17.517
WHETHER THEIR CLIENTS ARE

01:49:17.584 --> 01:49:18.985
ELIGIBLE FOR THE YOUNG CHILD TAX

01:49:19.052 --> 01:49:20.654
CREDIT WHENEVER THEY RECERTIFY

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:22.923
ELIGIBILITY FOR A PROGRAM. THAT

01:49:22.989 --> 01:49:24.024
MAKE APPOINTMENTS FOR THEM AT

01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:25.992
FREE TAX PREP SITES. THIS IS A

01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:27.260
BEST PRACTICE THAT WOULD

01:49:27.327 --> 01:49:29.229
DIRECTLY CONNECT FAMILIES FROM

01:49:29.296 --> 01:49:36.069
ONE SOURCE OF SUPPORT TO ANOTHER. IN THE CREDIT. FOR EXAMPLE

01:49:36.136 --> 01:49:37.570
MAYBE FAMILIES WITHOUT EARNINGS

01:49:37.637 --> 01:49:39.339
COULD CLAIM THE CREDIT WITHOUT

01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:39.873
FIRST HAVING TO COMPLETE A

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:41.708
FEDERAL RETURN. THAT WOULD EASE

01:49:41.775 --> 01:49:43.877
THE BURDEN FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE

01:49:43.944 --> 01:49:45.245
NO REASON TO FILE A FEDERAL TURN

01:49:45.312 --> 01:49:47.080
NOW THAT THEY ARE SHOT OUT OF

01:49:47.147 --> 01:49:48.815
THE FEDERAL CHILD TAX CREDIT. OR

01:49:48.882 --> 01:49:50.183
MAYBE HAVE TO BE COULD PROVIDE A

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:51.418
SIMPLIFIED METHOD FOR FAMILIES

01:49:51.484 --> 01:49:52.953
WITHOUT EARNINGS TO CLAIM THE

01:49:53.019 --> 01:49:53.987
CREDIT SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO

01:49:54.054 --> 01:49:55.922
WAIT THROUGH THE QUESTIONS ON A

01:49:55.989 --> 01:49:56.823
FULL STATE RETURN THAT ARE

01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:58.091
RELEVANT TO THEM. THESE ARE JUST

01:49:58.158 --> 01:50:00.360
SOME IDEAS AND AS WE HEARD

01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:02.195
EARLIER FTP HAS OTHERS AS WELL.

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:03.063
AND THE LAST POINT I WANT TO

01:50:03.129 --> 01:50:04.931
MAKE IS THAT IN LOOKING AT HOW

01:50:04.998 --> 01:50:08.368
TO GET THE YOUNG CHILD TAX

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:09.369
CREDIT. TO FAMILIES WITHOUT

01:50:09.436 --> 01:50:10.036
EARNINGS. THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:11.438
TO TACKLE A MUCH BROADER

01:50:11.504 --> 01:50:12.038
CHALLENGE. OF HOW TO PROVIDE

01:50:12.105 --> 01:50:13.673
ECONOMIC RELIEF THAT REACHES

01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:15.208
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE EARNINGS.

01:50:15.275 --> 01:50:16.710

STRUGGLING TO PAY BASIC EXPENSES

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:35.195
LAST MONTH. THE PROBLEM IS NOT

01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:37.497

01:50:44.671 --> 01:50:45.572

01:50:45.638 --> 01:50:46.840
CALIFORNIA ACHIEVED A REALLY

01:50:46.906 --> 01:50:48.541
INCREDIBLE FEET LAST YEAR.

01:50:48.608 --> 01:50:49.943

01:50:52.579 --> 01:50:54.080
TARGETING MILLIONS OF KALYA TO

01:50:55.915 --> 01:50:57.384
WITH GOLDEN STATE GRANTS THAT

01:50:57.450 --> 01:50:58.451
REACHED MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T

01:50:59.753 --> 01:51:01.488
GOTTEN THE STIMULUS TO FTP.

01:51:01.554 --> 01:51:03.490
THESE ARE PROVEN WAYS TO TARGET

01:51:03.556 --> 01:51:04.924

01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:06.826

01:51:14.067 --> 01:51:15.101

FLOOR TODAY BECAUSE CAPITA

01:57:13.025 --> 01:57:15.762
DESTROYED THAT'S ON STOP PUBLIC

01:57:15.828 --> 01:57:18.364

01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:20.066
SELL. DID NOT APPEAR TO BE

01:57:20.133 --> 01:57:22.068
GROWING THANK YOU HAD TO SEE

01:57:29.108 --> 01:57:31.978
WE NEEDED THEM TO GO TO GET MORE

01:57:32.044 --> 01:57:32.578
PEOPLE THAT ARE CLAIMING THE

IN PERSON SITES OFFLINE. LEAVING

01:57:44.424 --> 01:57:47.293
LITTLE SUPPORT OR ONLINE SUPPORT

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:48.127
WHICH NOT EVERYONE IS

01:57:48.194 --> 01:57:50.396
COMFORTABLE WITH THE STATISTICS

01:57:50.463 --> 01:57:52.231

THE SCOTT. SO THAT BEING SAID WE

01:58:05.445 --> 01:58:07.180
STILL DO YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A

01:58:07.246 --> 01:58:09.081
LARGE TRANSITORY POPULATION

01:58:09.148 --> 01:58:11.150
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CREDIT-

01:58:11.217 --> 01:58:13.453
HISTORICALLY CLOSE PRE COATED WE

01:58:13.519 --> 01:58:16.155

ARTS. ON SO WITH COPELAND WE SAW

01:58:25.398 --> 01:58:26.866
THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY ANALYZE

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:29.569

UNCLEAR WHERE THAT TRIMBLE SUCH

01:58:40.112 --> 01:58:42.615
BUT- THAT DOES SUGGEST. AGAIN I

01:58:42.682 --> 01:58:44.317
NEED THAT THERE IS SOME

01:58:44.383 --> 01:58:45.952
EDUCATION THAT IS APPROPRIATE

01:58:46.018 --> 01:58:48.221

01:58:48.287 --> 01:58:49.722
YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR FOLKS

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:57.730

01:58:57.797 --> 01:58:59.465
CREDIT ARM BOX HEARING ABOUT IT.

01:58:59.532 --> 01:59:00.967

INCONSISTENT WITH GENERAL

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:25.224

FIGHT AND NOT BEING SUCCESSFUL.

01:59:45.478 --> 01:59:49.849
IS LOCATION. AND I KNOW THAT THE

OTHER KIDS IN THE COMMUNITY

01:59:51.717 --> 01:59:52.251

EFFECTIVE- BUT THAT DOES NOT

02:00:01.294 --> 02:00:02.728
MEAN THAT THE VOLUNTEERS ARE

02:00:02.795 --> 02:00:04.196

MENTIONED THAT YOU SAW AN

02:00:42.134 --> 02:00:51.844
pFOR- EITC. SO MY COMMENTS- THANK

02:00:51.911 --> 02:00:53.479
YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO MY

02:00:53.546 --> 02:00:55.147
COMMENTS WERE IN REGARDS TO

02:00:55.214 --> 02:00:56.549
RELIEVE THE NUMBER OF

02:00:56.616 --> 02:00:57.917
INDIVIDUALS THAT CLAIM THE

02:00:57.984 --> 02:00:59.819
CURRENT YEAR OVER YEAR. OFTEN

02:00:59.885 --> 02:01:01.787
TIMES WHEN A TAX CREDIT IS

02:01:01.854 --> 02:01:03.789
IMPLEMENTED IT IS PRESUMED THAT

02:01:03.856 --> 02:01:05.224
IT'S GOING TO BE RELEVANT YEAR

02:01:05.291 --> 02:01:06.993
OVER YEAR. AND SO ONCE YOU KNOW

02:01:07.059 --> 02:01:09.061
ABOUT IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW

02:01:09.128 --> 02:01:11.130
ABOUT IT AGAIN BECAUSE YOU JUST

02:01:11.197 --> 02:01:11.764
AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO CRIMINAL

02:01:11.831 --> 02:01:12.865
YEAR'S RETURN YOU HAVE A

02:01:12.932 --> 02:01:14.300
CARRYOVER. CAL YET YOU SEE IS

02:01:14.367 --> 02:01:16.235
UNIQUE IN THAT WAY AND THAT IT

02:01:16.302 --> 02:01:17.803
REALLY IS FOCUSED AGAIN ON

02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:20.473
LOWER. THANKS THEN THE INCOME

02:01:20.539 --> 02:01:22.141
CHANNELS CHARM OR EXTREMELY IS

02:01:22.208 --> 02:01:24.210
CAN BE VERY TRANSITORY UP AND

02:01:24.276 --> 02:01:25.978
DOWN THE SCALE OF INCOME THAT

02:01:26.045 --> 02:01:28.347
MAKES AN ELIGIBLE ONE YEAR AND

02:01:28.414 --> 02:01:31.250
NOT ELIGIBLE THE NEXT. AND SO

02:01:31.317 --> 02:01:32.451
THAT IS THE REFERENCE POINT THAT

02:01:32.518 --> 02:01:35.254
I MADE EARLIER BEFORE KELVIN-

02:01:35.321 --> 02:01:37.056
EVEN IN SPITE OF THE GROWTH

02:01:37.123 --> 02:01:39.492
EVERY YEAR OF THE EXPANSION IS

02:01:39.558 --> 02:01:41.427
PROBABLY THE BETTER WORD TO SAY

02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:43.729
IN THE KALYANJI SIGNATURE. WE

02:01:43.796 --> 02:01:46.132
SAW ABOUT FORTY PEOPLE 40% OF

02:01:46.198 --> 02:01:48.100
THE FACTS CLAIMING THAT WERE

02:01:48.167 --> 02:01:50.569
REPETITIVE CLAIMS YEAR OVER

02:01:50.636 --> 02:01:57.410
YEAR. AND THEREFORE 60% WORK.

02:01:57.476 --> 02:02:00.446
I'M SORRY THE- THOSE OF THE

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:02.748
INDIVIDUALS WE WILL WANT TO SURE

02:02:02.815 --> 02:02:03.649
KNOW ABOUT IT AND SOME SHAPE

02:02:03.716 --> 02:02:04.817
FORM SO THAT THEY DON'T ON THEIR

02:02:04.884 --> 02:02:07.019
NOT AWARE THEY DON'T ACTION

02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:07.887
OTHERWISE. SO WE OPEN WHAT WE

02:02:07.953 --> 02:02:10.489
SAW AND MY LIKELY A RESULT OF

02:02:10.556 --> 02:02:11.057
THE- CONTINUING CHALLENGING

02:02:11.123 --> 02:02:14.360
ECONOMIC TIMES AND WE SAW MORE

02:02:14.427 --> 02:02:16.062
PEOPLE CLAIM THAT YOU'RE OVER

02:02:16.128 --> 02:02:18.597
HERE THAT- 40% HISTORICALLY WHEN

02:02:18.664 --> 02:02:21.067
UP TO ABOUT 50% A LITTLE BIT

02:02:21.133 --> 02:02:23.135
ABOUT 50% SO THAT FOR THE FIRST

02:02:23.202 --> 02:02:24.704
TIME MORE PEOPLE ARE FINDING IT

02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:27.373
YEAR OVER YEAR. UNLESS PEOPLE

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:30.142
WERE NEW TO THE PROGRAM HOWEVER

02:02:30.209 --> 02:02:32.478
THERE STILL IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT

02:02:32.545 --> 02:02:33.979
OF JOBS THAT ARE NEEDED EACH

02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:36.348
YEAR- THAT HAVEN'T CLEANED IN

02:02:36.415 --> 02:02:37.817
THE PAST AND THOSE ARE THE ONES

02:02:37.883 --> 02:02:44.223
BELIEVE THAT THE OUTRAGE PER SE. IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN REGARDS

02:02:44.290 --> 02:02:46.358
TO. THANK YOU FOR THAT- FOR THAT

02:02:46.425 --> 02:02:47.793
. AND IF YOU IF YOU CAN

02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:49.195
ELABORATE OR IF THE DEPARTMENT

02:02:49.261 --> 02:02:52.231
OF- FINANCE CAN ELABORATE THE

02:02:52.298 --> 02:02:54.166
BUDGET PROPOSES TEN MILLION FOR

02:02:54.233 --> 02:02:56.602
OUT REACH WHAT WAS THE OUT REACH

02:02:56.669 --> 02:02:59.739
DOLLARS FOR PREVIOUS YEARS. THE

02:02:59.805 --> 02:03:01.040
CURRENT YEAR BUDGET- FOR OUT

02:03:01.107 --> 02:03:03.109
REACHES A LEVEL OF ARTS FIFTEEN

02:03:03.175 --> 02:03:04.643
MILLION DOLLARS- AGAIN WE ARE

02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:05.911
PROPOSING TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:03:05.978 --> 02:03:07.279
THE BUDGET YEAR. THAT'S NOT A

02:03:07.346 --> 02:03:10.149
REFLECTION ON THE SEA OF

02:03:10.216 --> 02:03:12.551
OUTREACH- PER SE IT'S- JUST ON

02:03:12.618 --> 02:03:14.353
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WAS

02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:14.954
AVAILABLE FOR OUR REGION THE

02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:18.424
TOTALITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION

02:03:18.491 --> 02:03:22.228
SPENDING PROPOSAL. SO I GUESS I

02:03:22.294 --> 02:03:24.363
NEED A LITTLE BIT OF CLARITY

02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:25.765
BECAUSE OF. NUMBERS THAT WE SAW

02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:29.034
THAT REFLECTS A REDUCTION TO TEN

02:03:29.101 --> 02:03:30.970
MILLION TO FIFTEEN MILLION IS

02:03:31.036 --> 02:03:35.074
THAT ACCURATE. YES THAT IS

02:03:35.141 --> 02:03:36.942
CORRECT- WE ARE CLOSING TEN

02:03:37.009 --> 02:03:38.377
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE BUDGET

02:03:38.444 --> 02:03:40.479
YEAR AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT A

02:03:40.546 --> 02:03:43.549
REFLECTION. ON THE ADMINISTRATOR

02:03:43.616 --> 02:03:47.319
CAN VIEWS ON OUTREACH- IT'S JUST

02:03:47.386 --> 02:03:48.788
THE AMOUNT OF. MONEY THAT WAS

02:03:48.854 --> 02:03:52.057
AVAILABLE FOR OUTRAGE SPENDING

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:54.226
WITH THE AND THE FRAMEWORK THE-

02:03:54.293 --> 02:03:55.528
ADMINISTRATION'S OVERALL

02:03:55.594 --> 02:03:58.731
SPENDING PLAN FOR THE TWO

02:03:58.798 --> 02:03:59.899
THOUSAND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE

02:03:59.965 --> 02:04:02.001
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WELL IF THE

02:04:02.067 --> 02:04:04.069
BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR

02:04:04.136 --> 02:04:05.337
VALUES AND WE HAD ALREADY

02:04:05.404 --> 02:04:06.839
ALLOCATED FIFTEEN MILLION AND

02:04:06.906 --> 02:04:08.507
YOU'RE COMING BACK WITH TEN

02:04:08.574 --> 02:04:10.242
MILLION A REDUCTION OF FIVE

02:04:10.309 --> 02:04:12.011
MILLION. THAT TELLS ME THAT ARE

02:04:12.077 --> 02:04:13.412
REACHING TO LOW INCOME

02:04:13.479 --> 02:04:14.213
COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THE

02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:18.417
SUPPORT. ISN'T A PRIORITY. SO

02:04:18.484 --> 02:04:19.752
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE ARE

02:04:19.819 --> 02:04:21.554
ENCODED RECOVERY AND INCOME

02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:24.089
INEQUALITY IS A PRIORITY TO THE

02:04:24.156 --> 02:04:26.525
LEGISLATURE. WIDE WHY MAKE A

02:04:26.592 --> 02:04:28.527
WRITTEN A REDUCTION. OR A

02:04:28.594 --> 02:04:30.696

02:09:11.376 --> 02:09:13.579
Q. REASONS WHY THAT IS BUT THAT

02:09:13.645 --> 02:09:15.247
BECOMES VERY FRIENDLY IN THESE

02:09:15.314 --> 02:09:20.586
TYPES OF SITUATIONS WHERE.

02:09:20.652 --> 02:09:21.153
PERHAPS THERE IS NOT FINALLY

BEST TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THESE

02:09:38.237 --> 02:09:39.404
FOLKS THAT REALLY AREN'T VISIBLE

02:09:39.471 --> 02:09:41.607
TO FRANCHISE TOP FOUR BUT NOT SO

02:09:41.673 --> 02:09:43.342

YES SENATE. HEALTH CARE

02:09:46.278 --> 02:09:48.981
SERVICES. SO THAT THERE CAN BE

02:09:49.047 --> 02:09:50.315
OUTREACH BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO

02:09:50.382 --> 02:09:51.183
BE RELYING HEAVILY ON A

02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:53.285

SUGGESTS THAT- HANDED CREDIT.

02:09:57.322 --> 02:09:58.991
FOR INDIVIDUALS SAID THAT- THEY

02:09:59.057 --> 02:10:00.893

OTHERWISE BE OUTREACH TEAM. ONE

02:10:05.397 --> 02:10:06.398
THING INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIES

THEMSELVES OR OUT REACHES

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:09.868
PERFORMED DIRECTLY RATHER LIKE

02:10:09.935 --> 02:10:11.737
IT'S- SO THERE'S A COUPLE

02:10:11.803 --> 02:10:13.438
DIFFERENT WAYS RATE TYPICALLY.

02:10:13.505 --> 02:10:15.340
ALL RETURNS FROM ACROSS THE

ACCURATE TAX RETURN. WHICH

02:10:20.179 --> 02:10:21.046
GENERALLY INCLUDES THE

02:10:21.113 --> 02:10:26.418
COMBINATION OF FINE IN. FEDERAL

02:10:26.485 --> 02:10:27.419
AND STATE TAX RETURNS. AND THIS

02:10:27.486 --> 02:10:28.787
IS- AGAIN FOR MANY READ BECAUSE

02:10:28.854 --> 02:10:30.088
WE'RE NOT ONLY JUST TRYING TO

02:10:30.155 --> 02:10:32.457
PROTECT THE STATE BUT WE'RE

02:10:32.524 --> 02:10:32.991
ACTUALLY TRYING TO TAP THE

02:10:33.058 --> 02:10:34.393
TAXPAYER. AND WHEN RETURNED

02:10:34.459 --> 02:10:35.928
EFFORTS FOR FILING FALL OUTSIDE

02:10:35.994 --> 02:10:37.829
OF THAT TYPICAL REGIME THAT CAN

02:10:37.896 --> 02:10:40.832
BE A HAPPY- ADVENTURE FOR FRAUD.

02:10:40.899 --> 02:10:43.068
TO TAKE OVER WHICH MEANS THAT WE

02:10:43.135 --> 02:10:44.469
HAVE TO HELP TAXPAYERS ONLINE A

02:10:44.536 --> 02:10:46.004
LOT OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T WANT

02:10:46.071 --> 02:10:47.839

02:10:47.906 --> 02:10:49.942
IT CAN IT BE STOPPED AND OTHER

02:10:50.008 --> 02:10:51.910
THINGS. UNCERTAINLY ALLOWS- OR

02:10:51.977 --> 02:10:54.046
PUTS US THE STATE AT A

02:10:54.112 --> 02:10:55.447
DISADVANTAGE THAT WE HAVE TO

02:10:55.514 --> 02:10:56.815
SPEND RESOURCES ON COMBATING

02:10:56.882 --> 02:10:58.984
FRAUD. AND GETTING MONEY INTO

02:10:59.051 --> 02:11:01.520
THE HANDS OF THE STROKES. SELL

02:11:01.587 --> 02:11:03.155
OPTIONS THAT THEY CAN DO PUSHING

02:11:03.222 --> 02:11:04.856
WATER WILL BE CRITICAL AND THE

02:11:04.923 --> 02:11:06.892
SITUATION. SO THAT THE

02:11:06.959 --> 02:11:08.727
INDIVIDUALS CAN GET ASSISTANCE

02:11:08.794 --> 02:11:11.430
TO FILE AND OUR STATE OF THE

02:11:11.496 --> 02:11:12.564
MINIMUM LOOKING TO GET MAKE SURE

02:11:12.631 --> 02:11:14.433
THERE IS NO VALUE TO FILING THE

02:11:14.499 --> 02:11:16.268
STATE RETURN. BECAUSE THERE MAY

02:11:16.335 --> 02:11:18.270
NOT BE VALUE TO DATE DOESN'T

02:11:18.337 --> 02:11:19.638
MEAN THERE'S NOT A VALUE LATER

02:11:19.705 --> 02:11:22.140
WITH THE NET TAX INCENTIVES THAT

02:11:22.207 --> 02:11:23.275
MIGHT BE ADOPTED IN THE FUTURE.

02:11:23.342 --> 02:11:25.410
THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY CLAIM.

02:11:25.477 --> 02:11:28.146
BY DOING A LOT OF THESE FOLKS-

02:11:28.213 --> 02:11:29.214
WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THE

02:11:29.281 --> 02:11:31.350
PACKAGE IS THAT. IN THE EVENT

02:11:31.416 --> 02:11:32.217
THAT A RETURN AT THE FEDERAL

02:11:32.284 --> 02:11:33.819
LEVEL HAS NO VALUE. FIND IT

02:11:33.885 --> 02:11:36.088

02:11:36.154 --> 02:11:37.956
