OVER A SEVEN YEAR PERIOD --

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.270
SMOOTHING IN THE BACKLOG OF

00:28:25.336 --> 00:28:27.172
ASSET REPLACEMENTS WHICH IS

00:28:27.238 --> 00:28:27.705

STANDARD --

00:28:28.973 --> 00:28:32.911
WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A MANAGEABLE

00:28:32.977 --> 00:28:34.579
IS --

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:35.914
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'RE

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.048
PLANNING TO REPLACE OUR LIGHT

00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:40.018
DUTY ASSETS BUT EVERY SEVEN

00:28:40.952 --> 00:28:43.421
REPLACE THOSE ASSETS.

00:28:43.488 --> 00:28:46.424
SO WE UTILIZE A REPLACEMENT TOOL

00:28:46.491 --> 00:28:47.025
THAT --

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:49.094

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:51.963
CONDITION BEING A MORE

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:52.997
CONSERVATIVE APPROACH THAN JUST

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:55.700
AGE AND MILEAGE CURRENTLY BY THE

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:57.435
DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES --

00:28:57.502 --> 00:29:00.071
ABOUT 28% OF OUR ASSETS RIGHT

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:03.074
NOW OR TWENTY YEARS OLD --

00:29:03.141 --> 00:29:04.909

00:29:04.976 --> 00:29:07.545
US AT AGE IS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD.

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:08.746
SO WHAT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:10.448
PREVIOUS YEARS --

00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:12.817

DEPARTMENT OF FUNDS WHICH HAS

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.588
BEEN INSUFFICIENT TO KEEP UP

00:29:16.654 --> 00:29:18.656
WITH THE BACKLOG --

00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:20.892
SO THESE ANTIQUATED ASSETS --

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:22.260
MEETING OR EXCEEDING THE DIGEST

00:29:22.327 --> 00:29:23.461
RECOMMENDED THRESHOLD FOR

REPLACEMENT.

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:26.664
IS PROPOSING A REST TO THE

00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:28.733
DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO PERFORM

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.336
ITS MISSION CRITICAL FUNCTIONS.

00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:32.737
CORRECT.

00:29:32.804 --> 00:29:34.706
ME COMMENTS FROM FINANCE.

00:29:34.772 --> 00:29:35.640
RIGHT TO MY DEPARTMENT FINANCE I

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:36.274
JUST WANTED.

00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:37.442
TO ADD THAT WHEREAS IN THE PAST

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:38.376
THE DEPARTMENT IS REDIRECTED

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:40.778
FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE IN THIS

00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:41.379
PROPOSAL PROPOSING A SEPARATE

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:42.514
FUND -- SUB

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.683
PROGRAM TO TRACK SPECIFICALLY

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:46.317
FOR TRACKING PURPOSES FOR FLEET

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:48.753
EXPENDITURES.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.355
OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM THE PART

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:51.589
LA L..

00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:52.924
YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:53.591
CAITLYN O'NEILL WITH THE LA OKAY

00:29:53.658 --> 00:29:54.859
WE THINK THAT MORE FREQUENT

00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:56.394
REPLACEMENT OF VEHICLES MAKES

00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:58.329
SENSE AS A PART OF A STRATEGY TO

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:00.665
MINIMIZE OVERALL COSTS OF FLEET

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:01.533
OWNERSHIP.

00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:02.534
AND BY THAT I'M AYE SENSUALLY

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.335
MEANS SELLING VEHICLES NEAR THE

00:30:04.402 --> 00:30:06.704
POINT WHEN THEY'RE INCREASING

00:30:06.771 --> 00:30:07.906
REPAIR AND FUEL COSTS.

00:30:07.972 --> 00:30:09.240
START TO EXCEED THEIR ANNUAL

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:12.477
DEPRECIATE THIS IS CONSISTENT

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:13.945
WITH BEST PRACTICES IN THE FIELD

00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:15.747
OF FLEET MANAGEMENT.

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:17.682
HOWEVER WE DO HAVE TO CONCERT --

00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:19.817
A FEW CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL --

00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:21.252
AND THOSE ARE THAT --

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:22.954
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.923
ADMINISTRATION DOES OR DOESN'T

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:26.958
AND IS IT EITHER ISN'T PURSUING

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:28.660
THIS PROPOSAL WITH A GOAL OF

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:30.061
ACHIEVING SAVINGS WE THINK THAT

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:32.430
IT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN SAVING

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:33.531
SO -- WE

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:34.866
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO SCORE

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:36.601
SAVINGS IN VEHICLE VEHICLE FUEL

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:38.269
MAINTENANCE.

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:42.340
REPAIR AND HIGHER RESALE VALUE.

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:43.575
HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T

00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:45.076
ACCOUNT FOR THOSE SAVINGS THAT

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:45.810
WE THINK WOULD BE LIKELY TO

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:46.678
ACCRUE.

00:30:46.744 --> 00:30:47.946
WE ALSO NOT NOTE THAT THE

00:30:48.012 --> 00:30:49.314
DEPARTMENT --

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.449
GIVEN THE WAY THAT THIS PROPOSAL

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:53.952
IS SCHEDULED OUT --

00:30:54.018 --> 00:30:54.986
THE DEPARTMENT COULD STILL RE

00:30:55.053 --> 00:30:56.921
DIRECT MONEY TO OTHER PURPOSES

00:30:56.988 --> 00:30:59.891
WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION.

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:01.893
I'M DOING SO COULD INCREASE

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.561
FLEET COSTS AS IT WOULD TAKE

00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:05.196
AWAY RESOURCES THAT WOULD

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:06.998
OTHERWISE BE USED TO REPLACE

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:08.166
VEHICLES.

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:12.370
AT IN A MANNER THAT --

00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:14.906
MINIMIZING OVERALL COSTS.

00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:15.406
IT ALSO NOTE THAT WHILE

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:16.207
DEPARTMENT.

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:18.610
I JUST IDICATED THAT THEY DON'T

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:20.011
HAVE A BASE BUDGET.

00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:22.747
FOR A FLEET REPLACEMENT AND THEY

00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:24.449
DO HAVE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS

00:31:24.515 --> 00:31:27.385
AND OF THE RIP ADD.

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:28.987
ASSET REPLACEMENT FUNDS THAT

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:31.756
THEY'RE ACTUALLY PROPOSING.

00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:33.458
TO YOU TO PERMANENTLY DEDICATE

00:31:33.524 --> 00:31:35.193
VEHICLES SO ESSENTIALLY THEY DO

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.094
HAVE AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.528
BASE BUDGET FOR VEHICLES --

00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:39.864
THESE ARE THEY'VE ALSO SUGGESTED

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:40.765
THAT THEY'RE HAVING CHALLENGES

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:42.033
IN --

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.801
MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE

00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:45.069
INSTITUTIONS WITH THEIR EXISTING

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:46.170
FLEET THAT --

00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:47.905
BUT THEY HAVEN'T PROVIDED ANY

00:31:47.972 --> 00:31:49.741
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT ARE

00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:50.275
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:54.012
DEMONSTRATE THE INADEQUACY OF

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:55.079
THEIR CURRENT FLEET.

00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:56.147
SO WE RECOMMEND --

00:31:56.214 --> 00:31:57.749
THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CDC

INMATE ONE ON ONE FOR WHAT'S

WE EXPLAIN THE PRO HEARING

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:46.811
PROCESS WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:47.712
PROGRAMMING THAT THEY'VE DONE SO

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:48.546
FAR.

00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:50.781
AND WE GIVE THEM RECOMMENDATIONS

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:52.550
FOR THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD DO

00:35:52.617 --> 00:35:54.185

IN THE COMING UP WITH THAT TERM

00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:00.491
THAT THAT DURING THE SIXTY YEAR

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:02.860
PRIOR TO THEIR INITIAL HEARING --

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:04.395
WE ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND TALKED

00:36:04.462 --> 00:36:06.631
TO MANY PRO LIFERS AS WELL AS

00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:08.432
INMATES AND ASK THEM WHAT WHEN

00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:09.901
DO YOU THINK WHEN DURING YOUR

00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:11.235
PERIOD OF INCARCERATION DO YOU

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:13.271
THINK OF THE MOST MEANINGFUL. TO

00:36:13.337 --> 00:36:15.406
SIT DOWN AND TALK TO A PRO COULD

00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:17.041
COMMISSIONER DEPUTY COMMISSIONER.

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:18.709
AND MOST --

00:36:18.776 --> 00:36:23.014
RESPONDED THAT ROUGHLY FIVE THEY

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:23.614
WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:24.649
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:26.684
RECOMMENDATIONS PREVIOUSLY THE

00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:28.219
LAW REQUIRED THEM AS TO MEET

00:36:28.286 --> 00:36:30.087
WITH THEM AFTER THEIR THIRD YEAR

00:36:30.154 --> 00:36:31.589
OF THEIR LIFE TERM WHICH COULD

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.157
EVEN DECADES BEFORE THEIR

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.559
INITIAL HEARING SO.

00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:35.860
THAT CHANGED.

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:36.594
ALL RIGHT ONCE WE HAVE A

00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:38.029
CONSULTATION THE NEXT THING WE

00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:39.430
DO IS WE SCHEDULE THEIR HEARINGS

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:41.032
WE SCHEDULE HEARINGS FIVE TO SIX

00:36:41.098 --> 00:36:42.199
MONTHS IN ADVANCE.

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:44.068
THE REASON IT'S SO FAR OUT IS

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:46.070
BECAUSE SO MANY MANY THINGS NEED

00:36:46.137 --> 00:36:47.505
TO HAPPEN PRIOR TO HEARING.

00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:49.073
FIRST THING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.808
IS WE HAVE A COUNSELOR A

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:51.375
CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR THAT

00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:53.144
NEEDS TO DO A POST CONVICTION

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:54.412
REPORT FOR US.

00:36:54.478 --> 00:36:55.646
SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE MANY OF

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:57.014
THESE ARE MADE TO ME DOWN FOR

00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:59.383

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:11.829
HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS PRIOR TO

00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:12.964

00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:12.209
RELATIVELY SMALL PERCENTAGE.

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:13.410
SO FOR THE NON VIOLENT THIRD

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:15.679
STRIKERS JUST BECAUSE IT'S EASY

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:16.813
FOR EVERYONE HOW REFER TO THEM

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.114
AS THEM --

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.616
AS THAT WE HAVE WE ARE

PROJECTING ABOUT EIGHTEEN

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:22.152
HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND HEARINGS

00:50:22.219 --> 00:50:23.286
THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT

00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:25.322
ON CALENDAR IN THE NEXT FISCAL

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:26.056

00:50:26.123 --> 00:50:28.825
UNDER THE PROPOSITION FIFTY

00:50:28.892 --> 00:50:30.093
SEVEN A LITIGATION.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:30.927
IT'S A CASE CALLED IN RAY

00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:32.829
ADWORDS BASICALLY WHAT THE COURT

00:50:32.896 --> 00:50:34.631
SAID WAS THERE'S DESPITE THE

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:37.334
FACT THAT --

00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:39.069
PROPOSITION.

00:50:39.136 --> 00:50:41.772
FIFTY SEVEN FROM SAID THAT --

00:50:41.838 --> 00:50:43.173
THAT NON VIOLENT OFFENDERS WOULD

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.541
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PAROLE

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:46.009
REVIEW AFTER THEY SERVE THE FULL

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:48.278
TERM OF THEIR PRIMARY OFFENSE

00:50:48.345 --> 00:50:51.081
DESPITE THE REGARDLESS OF EXCUSE

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:53.216
ME EXCLUDING ALTERNATIVE

00:50:53.283 --> 00:50:53.483
SENTENCES.

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:54.885
I'M.

00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:57.254
THE COURTS BASICALLY SAID THAT

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.389
DESPITE THE PUBLIC SAFETY --

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:02.559
pOPTED NOT TO GO FORWARD WITH

00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:03.393
INCLUDING --

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.162
NONVIOLENT THIRD STRIKERS IN THE

00:51:05.228 --> 00:51:07.531
PRO REVIEW PROCESS IN A PROP.

00:51:07.597 --> 00:51:09.566
FIFTY SEVEN DESPITE THAT --

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:11.334
THE COURTS BASICALLY SAID THAT

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:13.837
THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES US TO

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:15.338
PROVIDE PRO REVIEW FOR

00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:16.473
INDETERMINATE SENTENCE

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:17.974
NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS.

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:19.443
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING I

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:21.378
WANTED -- TO

00:51:21.445 --> 00:51:23.980
JUST UNDERSTAND BECAUSE LEGAL

00:51:24.047 --> 00:51:25.182
FIRST AS YOU KNOW I'M NOT BY THE

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:26.283
THIRD STRIKERS ARE USUALLY

00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:29.319

FIVE TO LIFE PER A THIRD STRIKE.

00:51:30.954 --> 00:51:33.924
SO WHEN THE COURT IMPOSES THAT

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:35.058
TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE THAT IN AND

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:36.760
OF ITSELF UNDER THE LAW IS AN

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:38.395
ALTERNATIVE SENTENCE THE COURT

00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:40.363
DOESN'T ACTUALLY IMPOSE.

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.799
A STATES AN UNDERLYING BURGLARY --

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:43.867
THAT MIGHT HAVE A RUNNING

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:45.368
SENTENCE OF FOUR YEARS OR

00:51:45.435 --> 00:51:46.736
SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT THEY

00:51:46.803 --> 00:51:48.505
DON'T SAY FOUR YEARS IMPOSE THAT

00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:51.174
SENTENCE AND THEN IMPOSE TWENTY

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:51.508
FIVE TO LIFE.

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:52.909
THEY BASICALLY SAY YOU'VE BEEN

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:54.544
CONVICTED YOU BE CONVEYED IT'S A

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:55.712
THIRD STRIKE.

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:56.646
WE'RE GONNA SENTENCE YOU TO AN

00:51:56.713 --> 00:51:58.615
ALTERNATIVE SENTENCE OF TWENTY

00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:00.383
FIVE TO LIFE SO WHEN THE WHEN

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:03.086
THE CONSTITUTION UNDER PROP

00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:05.021
FIFTY SEVEN SAYS THAT --

00:52:05.088 --> 00:52:06.857
WE ARE TO PROVIDE SOMEBODY A PRO

00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:08.558
HEARING A NONVIOLENT OFFENDER A

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:09.993
PRO HEARING AFTER THEY SERVE THE

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.161
FULL TERM OF THEIR PRIMARY

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:12.863
OFFENSE REGARDLESS YOU

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:14.331
DISREGARDING ANY OTHER

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:15.832
ALTERNATIVE SENTENCES.

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:17.133
THERE WAS AN IMPOSED BY THE

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.401
COURT --

00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:20.036
THERE WAS NO SENTENCE IMPOSED BY

00:52:20.103 --> 00:52:21.004
THE COURT OTHER THAN THE

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:22.405
ALTERNATIVE SENTENCE SO THE

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:23.940
QUESTION BECAME NGUYEN WHICH

00:52:24.007 --> 00:52:25.141
WHEN WITH THESE PEOPLE WHEN WITH

00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:26.476
THESE INMATES BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:27.377
HEARING.

00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:29.246
WHAT THE COURT SAID IN IN RAY AT

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:31.481
WORDS WAS THAT THE STATES WOULD

00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:32.549
HAVE TO GIVE SOMEBODY A PRO

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:34.851
HEARING ONCE THEY'VE SERVED?

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:36.520
THE WOULD HAVE FOR PURPOSES OF A

00:52:36.586 --> 00:52:37.854
THIRD STRIKE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:39.322
AT THE UNDERLYING OFFENSE AND

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:40.891
ASSUME THAT THE COURT THAT THE

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:42.926
COURT IMPOSE THE AGGRAVATED TERM

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:44.261
FOR THE UNDERLINE OFFENSE.

00:52:44.327 --> 00:52:46.129
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR

00:52:46.196 --> 00:52:50.000
THE NON VIOLENT THIRD STRIKERS --

00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:50.534
AND THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.536
SENTENCES [inaudible]

00:52:52.602 --> 00:52:54.871
SO.

00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:57.507
WE AT THE BOARD TO TRY VERY HARD

00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:58.675
WHENEVER THERE'S AN INCREASE IN

00:52:58.742 --> 00:53:00.043
WORKLOAD TO TRYING STREAMLINED

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:01.678
OUR PROCESS SEES MAKE THINGS

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:03.680
MORE EFFICIENT BEFORE WE COME

00:53:03.747 --> 00:53:05.181
AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES.

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:07.150
SO YOU'RE NOT SEEN A

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:10.153
COMMENSURATE REQUEST OF A 38%

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.455
INCREASE AND IN BOARD MEMBERS OR

00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:13.890
IN STAFFING AT THE BOARD.

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:16.293
INSTEAD WE ARE TRYING A VARIETY

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:18.895
OF DIFFERENT THINGS --

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:21.298
TO IMPLEMENT A NEW STRATEGIES TO

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:23.667
ADDRESSES WORKLOAD ONE IS YES

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:25.101
WE'RE ASKING TO EXPERIENCE FOUND

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:26.670
THE BOARD BY TWO MEMBERS SO WE

00:53:26.736 --> 00:53:28.338
CURRENTLY HAVE FIFTEEN MEMBERS

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:29.539
APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR

00:53:29.606 --> 00:53:31.474
SUBJECT SENATE CONFIRMATION.

00:53:31.541 --> 00:53:32.842
WE ARE ASKING FOR TWO MORE.

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:34.177
THOSE ARE IN THE PENAL CODE SO

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:35.011
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE BUDGET

00:53:35.078 --> 00:53:36.212
TRAILER LANGUAGE THAT WOULD

00:53:36.279 --> 00:53:38.181
EXPAND THE BOARD --

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:39.182
UNDER THE PENAL CODE.

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:40.483
THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:41.818
LOOKING AT DOING ONE WHICH WILL

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:43.353
BE THE SUBJECT I'M SURE OF SOME

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.921
DISCUSSION TODAY IS THAT WE'RE

00:53:44.988 --> 00:53:46.022
LOOKING AT IMPLEMENTING WHAT'S

00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:48.124
CONSTRUCTION STRUCTURE DECISION

00:53:48.191 --> 00:53:49.359
MAKING FRAMEWORK.

00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:50.794
IT'S USED BY THE NATIONAL PRO

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.395
ABORT OF CANADA THAT'S WHERE WAS

00:53:52.462 --> 00:53:54.197
DEVELOPED ADMITTEDLY IT WAS

00:53:54.264 --> 00:53:55.265
DEVELOPED MOSTLY FOR

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.566
DETERMINEDLY SENTENCED INMATES

00:53:56.633 --> 00:53:58.435
BECAUSE AS YOU MAY KNOW MANY

00:53:58.501 --> 00:53:59.936
COUNTRIES DON'T HAVE LIFE TERM

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:01.571
INMATES OR REALLY LENGTHY

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:03.006
SENTENCES LIKE WE DO.

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:05.141
SO IT'S BASED ON EVIDENCE AND

00:54:05.208 --> 00:54:06.476
RESEARCH THAT SHOWS --

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:08.912
SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIES FACTORS

00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:10.880
EITHER AGGRAVATE OR MITIGATE AND

00:54:10.947 --> 00:54:13.049
INMATES RISK FOR RECIDIVISM UPON

00:54:13.116 --> 00:54:14.217
RELEASE.

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:16.620
WE ARE USING THAT TOOL HARD

00:54:16.686 --> 00:54:19.189
LOOKING TO USE THAT TOOL AND

00:54:19.255 --> 00:54:21.825
HAVING A MODIFIED --

00:54:21.891 --> 00:54:25.762
VERY QUICKLY ADMITTEDLY THE THIS

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.731
GOT SPED UP WE WERE PLANNING ON

00:54:27.797 --> 00:54:28.965
DOING THIS OVER THE COURSE OF

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:30.600
THE NEXT YEAR STUDYING IT DOING

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:32.035
ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:33.036
AND THEN THE ADWORDS HIS

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:35.705
DECISION HIT AND WE WERE FACED

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:37.674
WITH WE NEED TO INCREASE --

00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:39.676
OUR WORKLOAD CAPACITY SO WE CAN

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:41.111
EITHER SCHEDULE MORE HEARINGS

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:44.147
PER DAY AND TO DO BUSINESS AS

00:54:44.214 --> 00:54:47.584
USUAL ONLY FASTER OR WE COULD --

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.319
TRY TO DO IT IN A MEANINGFUL WAY --

00:54:49.386 --> 00:54:50.420
WITH SOME STRUCTURE DECISION

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:52.722
MAKING AND THAT'S FAR WHAT WE'RE

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:54.057
RECOMMENDING IS A LADDER.

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:56.259
SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THE THE

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:57.694
CARLETON UNIVERSITY OUT OF

00:54:57.761 --> 00:54:59.229
OTTAWA CANADA THAT CREATED THE

00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:00.864
TOOL IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED SEVEN

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.399
OTHER STATES.

00:55:02.465 --> 00:55:05.101
AGAIN I WOULD JUST ONE EMPHASIZE

00:55:05.168 --> 00:55:06.269
OTHER STATES PAROLED --

00:55:06.336 --> 00:55:08.571
PRO SYSTEMS ARE INCREDIBLY

00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:10.440
DIFFERENT FROM CALIFORNIA MOST

00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:11.875
STATES DO NOT GIVE A LIBERTY

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:13.076
INTEREST IN PAROLE LIKE

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:15.545
CALIFORNIA DOES SO WE HAVE THE

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:17.447
ADDED BONUS OF LOTS OF SCRUTINY

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:18.882
FROM THE COURTS --

00:55:18.948 --> 00:55:20.550
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE IN OTHER

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:21.818
STATES IT'S ACTUALLY.

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:23.186
I DON'T MEAN THAT SARCASTICALLY

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:24.954
IT IS ACTUALLY AN ADDED BENEFIT

00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:26.756
IT'S VERY GOOD FOR US TO HAVE

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:28.124
SOMEBODY SCRUTINIZING OUR

00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:28.725
DECISIONS.

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:30.960
WE'VE --

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:33.430
BENEFITED GREATLY FROM THAT

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:34.831
DON'T PROVIDE ATTORNEYS THEY

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:36.433
DON'T HAVE WIFE HEARINGS --

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:37.767
IF THEY DO HAVE LIKE HEARINGS

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:39.102
THEY COULD BE MAYBE TEN MINUTES

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:41.037
FOR AN INTERVIEW --

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:41.805
BUT THEY'RE NOT ALSO DEALING

00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:43.907
WITH LIFE TERM INMATES WHO HAVE

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:44.908
COMMITTED --

00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:47.544
HEINOUS CRIMES SO IN CALIFORNIA

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.079
WE HAVE A RATHER PROTRACTED

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:51.648
HEARING PROCESS WE'RE LOOKING TO

00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:53.783
MODIFY THE STRUCTURE DECISION

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.185
MAKING FRAMEWORK WITH THE HELP

00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:56.653
OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.253
CORRECTIONS.

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.722
THEY PROVIDED SOME TECHNICAL

00:55:58.788 --> 00:56:00.390
ASSISTANCE TO US BROUGHT OUT

00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:00.623
SOME --

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.358
PRETTY AMAZING --

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:04.060
EXPERTS TO HELP US IN

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:05.495
IDENTIFYING WHETHER OR NOT THIS

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:07.130
WOULD BE A GOOD TOOL FOR US AND

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:08.965
RECOGNIZING WHAT MODIFICATIONS

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:12.102
MIGHT NEED NEED TO BE MADE. TO

00:56:12.168 --> 00:56:13.570
CONFORM THE TOOL.

00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:15.305
TO CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNING LAW.

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:16.606
THE IDEA BEHIND THE STRUCTURE

00:56:16.673 --> 00:56:18.208
DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK IS TWO

00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:20.143
FOLD ONE IT THREEFOLD SKEWS ME

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.745
ONE IS -- TO

00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:23.546
IMPROVE CONSISTENCY AMONG BOARD

00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:24.948
MEMBERS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT

00:56:25.014 --> 00:56:27.550
WE ALWAYS ARE STRIVING FOR IT

00:56:27.617 --> 00:56:28.818
SHOULDN'T MATTER WHETHER IN IN

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:30.520
MAY TWO OR OR VICTIM COMES

00:56:30.587 --> 00:56:32.622
BEFORE ONE PANEL VERSES ANOTHER

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:34.257
THE OUTCOME SHOULD BE RELATIVELY

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:35.158
THE SAME.

00:56:35.225 --> 00:56:36.693
THE OTHER THING AND THE RATE THE

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.994
WAY THE TOOL DOES THAT IS TO

00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:39.696
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:42.899
CONSIDERING THE SAME INFORMATION --

00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:44.501
IN A IN A SIMILAR WHAT WOULD

00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:47.270
AGRA EIGHT SOMEBODY'S REYES THEY

00:56:47.337 --> 00:56:50.106
ARE FOR LEE ON THE FACTORS --

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:53.710
INCREASE FOR WE DO SO YES

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:54.010
[inaudible]

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:57.881
I MIND IF I JUST INTERRUPT YOUR

00:56:57.947 --> 00:57:00.316
NASCO PLEASE YEAH I'M JUST

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:01.751
CURIOUS WHAT JUST.

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:03.453
HAS THERE NOT BEEN CONSISTENCY

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.422
UP TO THIS POINT WITH RESPECT --

00:57:06.489 --> 00:57:07.390
TO HOW THE SITUATION IS

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:08.558
CONSIDERED AMONG PAROLE BOARD

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:09.859
MEMBERS.

00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:11.795
SO I DON'T THINK THE OUTCOMES

00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:13.096
ARE THAT.

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:16.900
THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT --

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:18.468
INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE A

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:19.803
COMMISSIONER SPENDS A MAJORITY

00:57:19.869 --> 00:57:20.703
THEIR TIME MIDDLE LEVEL FOR

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:21.805
INSTITUTIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE

00:57:21.871 --> 00:57:22.772
MORE DENIALS.

00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:23.973
THEN IF THEY'RE AT A HIGH

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.109
PROGRAMMING INSTITUTION SO IT'S

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:27.644
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO FACTORY IN

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:30.079
THOSE THINGS BUT I CAN TELL YOU --

00:57:30.146 --> 00:57:32.081
WHEN WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS AT OUR

00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:33.983
MONTHLY EXECUTIVE BOARD MEETINGS

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:34.851
WHERE WILL HAVE A CASE THAT

00:57:34.918 --> 00:57:36.152
COMES FORWARD SAY IT WAS A TIE

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:38.421
VOTE OR THERE'S RECONSIDERATION

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:39.722
OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT NEW

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:40.857
INFORMATION?

00:57:40.924 --> 00:57:42.592
HEARING THE COMMISSIONERS TALK

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:44.460
ABOUT HOW THE ADDRESS DIFFERENT

00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:46.462
THINGS IT DOES VERY I'M NOT SURE

00:57:46.529 --> 00:57:48.031
THAT IT IT RESULTS IN A

00:57:48.097 --> 00:57:50.633
DIFFERENT OUTCOME BUT I THINK IT

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.635
DEFINITELY THEY THEY TAKE

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:54.370
DIFFERENT INFORMATION AND KIND

00:57:54.437 --> 00:57:56.005
OF APPLIED DIFFERENTLY I THINK.

00:57:56.072 --> 00:57:59.776
SO IN YOUR SOLUTION TO REMEDY

00:57:59.843 --> 00:58:01.311
THAT SITUATION IS WHAT AGAIN SO

00:58:01.377 --> 00:58:02.812
THIS STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING

00:58:02.879 --> 00:58:04.447
FRAMEWORK WOULD HAVE IT

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:06.649
IDENTIFIES SEVEN KEY DOMAINS

00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:08.151
THAT EACH COMMISSIONER WOULD

00:58:08.218 --> 00:58:09.919
FOCUS ON IN EVERY HEARING BOTH

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:12.121
IN PREPARING FOR HEARING AND AT

00:58:12.188 --> 00:58:15.491
THE HEARING.

00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:16.960
AND IT BASICALLY.

00:58:17.026 --> 00:58:17.727
I'LL TELL YOU I THINK THE THE

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:18.027
BIGGEST --

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:19.329
PLUS TO IT BESIDES ORGANIZING

00:58:19.395 --> 00:58:20.396
THINGS --

00:58:20.463 --> 00:58:22.265
AND FOCUSING THEIR THEIR

00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:23.733
ATTENTION IS.

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.768
PERHAPS NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.003
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT RESEARCH

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:28.671
SUGGESTS HAS ABSOLUTELY NO

00:58:28.738 --> 00:58:30.773
IMPACT ON RISK. FOR INSTANCE

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:33.309
SOCIAL HISTORY IF WE STAY TIME

00:58:33.376 --> 00:58:34.811
TALKING TO SOMEBODY ABOUT THEIR

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:37.680
UPBRINGING AND WHAT IMPACT THAT

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:39.082
MAY HAVE HAD ON THEM WHEN THIS

00:58:39.148 --> 00:58:40.617
IS THEIR TENTH HEARING.

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:42.352
AND THEY'VE BEEN INCARCERATED

00:58:42.418 --> 00:58:43.519
FOR FORTY YEARS.

00:58:43.586 --> 00:58:45.622
IT'S PROBABLY NOT AS PROBATIVE

00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:48.358
AS YOU KNOW WHAT I'M JUST I AM

00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:50.727
FORGIVE ME I'M JUST I'M IS THERE

00:58:50.793 --> 00:58:52.195
IS THERE A A DOLLAR AMOUNT

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:53.763
ATTACHED TO THIS REMEDY THAT

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:54.764
YOU'VE SUGGESTED YOU'RE JUST NO

00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:56.366
COLLUDING THAT I'M INCLUDING IT

00:58:56.432 --> 00:58:58.401
AS THAT MOST PEOPLE ASK US --

00:58:58.468 --> 00:59:00.370
IF WE'RE LOOKING 238% INCREASE

00:59:00.436 --> 00:59:02.272
IN WORKLOAD WHY ARE WE NOT

00:59:02.338 --> 00:59:03.473
ASKING --

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:05.675
FOR AND MORE COMMISSIONERS TO

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:09.245
EXPAND OUR BUT IN A HE WOULD

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:10.480
HAVE OR THAT RATHER THAN SENDING

00:59:10.546 --> 00:59:11.080
GOVERNMENT.

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:11.814
YEAH.

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.016
SO I APOLOGIZE THEM.

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:14.550
IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

00:59:14.617 --> 00:59:16.152
PUTTING FORWARD AS A REMEDY TO

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:18.121
THAT WORKLOAD SO YES THERE'S NO

00:59:18.187 --> 00:59:19.389
MONEY ATTACHED TO IT.

00:59:19.455 --> 00:59:20.757
BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:22.025
WILL BE VERY NOVEL IN VERY

00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:24.794
DIFFERENT --

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:25.361
FOR THE PRO ABORTS SO YOU'RE

00:59:25.428 --> 00:59:29.032
GONNA HEAR SO MADAM CHAIR I IF

00:59:29.098 --> 00:59:29.666
YOU WANT TO FOCUS JUST ON THE

00:59:29.732 --> 00:59:31.434
FIFTH NO NO I JUST WANT TO MAKE

00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:34.304
A COMMENT I GUESS I'M --

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:40.576
SURPRISED THAT THAT TYPE OF TEST

00:59:40.643 --> 00:59:42.412
IF YOU WILL HAS NOT BEEN PUT

00:59:42.478 --> 00:59:43.713
INTO PLACE.

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.915
IN THE PAST I DON'T UNDERSTAND --

00:59:45.982 --> 00:59:47.183
WHY WE DON'T HAVE STRUCTURE

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.018
DECISION WE GOT NOW SO WE DO

00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:50.720
HAVE OUTLINES FOR HEARINGS AND

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:52.255
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT BY

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:53.356
LAW AND?

00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:54.624
THROUGH TRAINING WE DO A

00:59:54.691 --> 00:59:55.992
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TRAINING AT

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:57.894
THE BOARD THAT EVERYONE COVERS.

00:59:57.961 --> 00:59:58.962
I WILL TELL YOU THAT UP UNTIL

00:59:59.028 --> 01:00:00.096
NOW -- THIS

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:01.564
THIS WHOLE AREA THE LAW HAS

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:03.333
EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY AND THE

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:05.601
PRO HEARING PROCESS HAS JUST

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:07.337
KIND OF GROWN --

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:08.938
SIGNIFICANTLY OUR HEARINGS ARE

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:11.341
ROUGHLY THREE HOURS ON AVERAGE

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:12.575
SINCE THE LONGEST I'VE SEEN IN

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:14.911
ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WE KIND

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:16.212
OF OUR MANTRA --

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.680
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS SO

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:19.315
SCRUTINIZED BY.

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:22.185
OUR LEGAL STAFF THE GOVERNOR AND

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:24.921
THE COURTS IS TO TALK OF A

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:25.455
BETTER TERM LEAVE NO STONE

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:26.089
UNTURNED

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:28.224
SO THE IDEA IS TO TRY IT RIGHT

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:29.625
NOW OUR EMPHASIS HAS BEEN ON

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:31.594
CREATE THE MOST COMPLETE RECORD

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:33.196
THAT YOU CAN IN THAT TRANSCRIPT

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:35.131
TO COMPLETELY --

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:35.898
MAKE SURE YOU'VE COVERED

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:38.034
EVERYTHING AND THAT YOU'VE LEFT

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:39.669
NOTHING --

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:42.772
ON TOUCH AND IT'S JUST EVOLVE

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:44.374
THAT WAY OVER TIME --

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.642
THROUGH RATES WITH THE COURTS

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:49.112
AND THROUGH DECISION GOING TO BE

01:00:49.178 --> 01:00:52.915
A VERY GOOD WAY. TO RESTRUCTURE

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.517
IT PROBABLY WILL FOR THE FIRST

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:55.718
TIME IN DECADES.

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:57.720
AND REALLY FOCUS OUR ATTENTION

01:00:57.787 --> 01:01:00.456
ON THE THINGS THAT MATTER.

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:02.325
I HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH IT

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:04.727
I MEAN IT DOES I'D I THINK THIS

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:05.862
WARRANTS PROBABLY FURTHER

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:07.630
CONVERSATION --

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:08.498
OUTSIDE OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:10.233
HEARING ROOMS THEY DO HAVE SOME

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:11.134
MORE QUESTIONS THAT ARE

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.635
LINGERING ABOUT THIS WHOLE

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:16.672
PROCESS AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:18.307
CREATION OF WORK THAT ISN'T.

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:19.809
NECESSARY BUT AS PART BECAUSE

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:21.210
MAYBE I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:22.045
EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO TRIED

01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:23.312
LIKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:25.782
FURTHER AFTER THIS ON BUT THANK

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:26.382
YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:27.717
ABOUT TRUMP.

01:01:27.784 --> 01:01:28.818
SO.

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:31.187
IN ADDITION TO EXPANDING THE

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:33.523
BOARD AND DOING THE STRUCTURE

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:35.091
DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK ANY

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:36.059
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WHAT WE TALK

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:37.326
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE

01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:37.860
STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:38.861
FRAMEWORK.

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:42.532
IT IS ON A FAST TRACK ADMITTEDLY.

01:01:42.598 --> 01:01:43.833
I A QUESTION THAT.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.301
WE HAVE KIND OF GONE.

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.336
BEYOND NOW BUT I BACK WHEN YOU

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:48.905
ARE TALKING ABOUT PRIVATE

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.106
COUNSEL YES --

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:53.643
WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE PRIVATE

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:54.577
COUNSEL IT'S GOT TO BE PRETTY

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:55.278
LOW?

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.880
I'M WHICH IS PROBABLY ABOUT

01:01:57.947 --> 01:01:59.682
10215% IT'S EVEN HARDER THOUGHT

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:02.185
IT WOULD BE.

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.653
THAT'S ALL I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:05.021
AS I FIGURED IT WOULD FIVE BE

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.489
PRETTY LOW.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.890
IT IF OKAY.

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:09.225
I'M THE THIRD THING THAT WE'RE

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:10.893
GONNA BE LOOKING TO DO TO TRY

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.628
AND ABSORB THE WORKLOAD WITHOUT

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:14.831
ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:17.033
IS TO COME UP WITH SOME --

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.001
COME UP SOME DRAFT REGULATIONS

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:21.604
THAT WILL HELP STREAMLINE AND

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:23.940
MORE IT NARROWLY DEFINED THE

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:25.475
DOCUMENTS --

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:27.076
THAT ARE MOST RELEVANT TO

PROCEED ABILITY HEARING CON --

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:29.879
HEARING.

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:31.881
AND THE REASON BEING LIKE I SAID

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:33.416
BEFORE RIGHT NOW IT'S KIND OF A

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:34.717
SHOTGUN APPROACH.

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:36.452

ANYBODY CAN DISCUSS ANYTHING AT

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.555
A PRO HEARING AND IT'S ALL KIND

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:41.591
OF DEEMED THE PANEL IS IN CHARGE

01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:43.860
OF DETERMINING WHAT'S RELEVANT

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:44.827
WHAT'S RELIABLE.

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.062
IN ADVANCE OF A PRO HEARING IF

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:47.530

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:27.403
TRYING TO REVIEW EVERY DOCUMENT

THAT'S BEEN SENT AND PLUS THE

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:30.339
ENTIRE CENTRAL FILE.

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:31.807
IN PREPARATION FOR THIS HEARING

01:03:31.874 --> 01:03:33.843
PLUS PRIOR TRANSCRIPTS THE RISK

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.912
ASSESSMENT THE VOLUME IS IS

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.047
QUITE SIGNIFICANT SO WE'RE

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:39.982
LOOKING AT STREAMLINING THAT SO

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.551
THAT PEOPLE NEED TO DO.

01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:42.618
SOMETHING I CAN DO WOULD LIKE AN

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:44.754
OFFER PROOF THIS IS WHY THIS IS

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.289
RELEVANT TO THIS PROCEEDING.

DON'T DON'T GIVE US INFORMATION

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:49.559
FROM THE C. FILE THAT WE ALREADY

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.861

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.029
YOU KNOW DURING.

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:54.497
ELECTRONICALLY --

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:57.066
TRANSCRIPTS FROM THE THE

01:03:57.133 --> 01:03:58.501
ORIGINAL CRIMINAL TRIAL.

01:03:58.568 --> 01:03:59.936
PROBABLY NOT RELEVANT IN EVERY

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:02.205
CASE AND CERTAINLY NOT WHEN IT

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:04.106
SUBMITTED FOR THE FOURTH TIME --

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:05.107
BECAUSE ASSIST THE INMATES

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:07.610
FOURTH HEARING SO WE'D LIKE TO

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.111
REALLY STREAMLINED THAT SO THAT

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:10.680
IT CUTS DOWN ON SOME OF THE

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:13.282
HEARING PREPARATION --

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:15.518
FOR COMMISSIONERS.

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:16.118
OKAY HI I'M.

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:16.719
THE FOURTH THING THAT WE'RE

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:18.487
LOOKING AT DOING IS IMPROVING

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:20.022
ATTORNEY REPRESENTATION.

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:21.757
AND THAT IS A BUDGET PROPOSAL

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:25.294
WERE ASKING TO INCREASE THE FEE --

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:27.763
PER HEARING FROM FOR FOUR

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.432
HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS --

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:32.602
PER HEARING TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.103
FIFTY THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:35.838
OUR PLAN HOWEVER IS NOT JUST

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:38.774
INCREASE THE HEARING OF THE FEES --

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:42.245
WE ALSO WANT TO DO A SIGNIFICANT

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:44.247
CREASING EXPECTATIONS --

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:46.582
FOR ATTORNEYS WHO ARE APPOINTED

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:47.116
BY THE BOARD TO REPRESENT

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:48.217
INMATES.

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:49.852
REASON BEING I THINK ARE YOU

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:51.387
HERE IN THE NEXT PANEL THE BULK

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:52.388
OF THE WORK THAT IN A MAKE

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:53.956
COUNCIL NEEDS TO DO IN ADVANCE

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:55.458
OF A PAROLE HEARING IS TO

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:56.959
ACTUALLY PREPARE THEIR HERE.

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:58.160
PREPARE THEIR INMATE THEIR

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.696
CLIENT PRIOR TO THE HEARING.

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:01.597
THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THEY

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:03.266
ACTUALLY DO AT THE HEARING IS

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:05.635
NOT PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT IN

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:07.536
MOST CASES IT'S REALLY THE

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:09.038
HEARING THE PREPARATION WORK IN

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:10.273
ADVANCE.

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:12.008
ALSO THE WAY OUR HEARING OUR FEE

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:14.010
STRUCTURE FEES ARE STRUCTURED

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:15.411
RIGHT NOW IT'S CREATED AN

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:17.113
INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:19.081
GO TO HEARING EVEN OTHER INMATE

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:19.815
MAKE THEIR CLIENT MAY NOT BE

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:20.650
SUITABLE.

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:22.318
BECAUSE THEY GET MORE MONEY IF

01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:23.286
THEY ACTUALLY GO TO HEARING.

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:27.089
SO WE'D LIKE TO TAKE THE TIME TO

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:30.359
GET THE INCREASE BUT ALSO WORK

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:31.994
WITH IN MAY COUNSEL.

01:05:32.061 --> 01:05:33.562
AND PLAINTIFFS IN A PENDING

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:36.198
LAWSUIT TO FIGURE OUT --

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:38.434
A BETTER WAY RECRUITING --

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.603
ATTORNEYS TRAINING THEM.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.171
PUTTING A FEE SCHEDULE TOGETHER

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.939
THAT MAKES SENSE THE DOESN'T

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:45.708
EITHER I INCENTIVIZE OR D.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.377
INCENTIVIZE A CERTAIN BEHAVIOR.

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:49.312
AND THAT --

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:51.647
PROVIDES A MORE QUALITY

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:54.383
ASSURANCE FOR IN MAY COUNCIL.

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:55.818
SPECIFICALLY A COUPLE THINGS

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:57.219
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING FOR

01:05:57.286 --> 01:05:58.654
SO I WANNA SAY IT'S VERY AWKWARD

01:05:58.721 --> 01:05:59.822
FOR US TO BE IN THE BUSINESS OF

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:01.290
APPOINTING COUNSEL WHO APPEAR

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:02.458
BEFORE US.

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:04.093
UNDER SUPERIOR COURT SETTING IF

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.296
YOU EATING --

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:09.298
IT'S IT'S THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:10.866
OFFICE IF THEY NEED A CONFLICT

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:12.234
OUT THEY GO THROUGH THE

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:14.937
APPELLATE PROJECT A NONPROFIT

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:16.872
THIRD ENTITY TO APPOINT TO

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:19.041
RECRUIT AND APPOINT COUNSEL.

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:21.610
ON SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT --

01:06:21.677 --> 01:06:23.012
WE LOOKED INTO THAT IT WAS GOING

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:24.980
TO BE A LOT MORE COSTLY TO GO

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:26.449
THROUGH A SET UP SIMILAR --

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:27.883
TO THE PALLET PROJECT OR EVEN TO

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:29.118
GO THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:30.453
OFFICE OF THE COURTS.

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:32.955
SO WHAT WE ARE PLANNING ON DOING --

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.256
THIS IS JUST OUR RECOMMENDATION

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:35.324
IT'S GONNA BE SUBJECT TO

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:38.027
PROBABLY SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS --

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:39.795
IN A PENDING LAWSUIT RIGHT NOW

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:41.964
WE'RE BEING SUED BECAUSE WHAT

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:43.432
THE ALLEGATION IS THAT IS THERE

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:46.035
ARE ATTORNEY FEE SCHEDULE IS SO

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:48.003
LOW THAT EVEN QUITE STAND

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.372
EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:51.173
SO THAT'S GOING FOR EVIDENTIARY

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.009
PROCEEDINGS VERY SOON AND IT'S

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:56.178
PROBABLY ONE THAT WE WILL NOT DO

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:59.048
VERY WELL AT SO WE ARE LOOKING

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:01.250
AT HOW TO REMEDY THIS.

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:03.419
WHAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING OR WHAT

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:05.421
WE'RE LOOKING ELEMENT

01:07:05.488 --> 01:07:07.556
NEGOTIATIONS WE WON'T

01:07:07.623 --> 01:07:09.291
CONFIDENTIAL SO WE CAN'T TALK

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.693
ABOUT IT BUT I CAN TELL YOU?

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.128
KIND OF OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT IT

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:13.729
RIGHT NOW BEFORE IT STARTS

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:15.097
PROBABLY IN A COUPLE WEEKS.

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.366
I'M ONE IS WE WOULD LIKE TO DO

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:19.135
MORE NUTS AND BOLTS TRAINING

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.404
FROM THE BOARD SO THESE ARE LAWS

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.638
THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IT A

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.373
PROFITABILITY HEARING HERE THE

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.841
BASIC EXPECTATIONS.

01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:27.543
WE'D LIKE TO CONTRACT WITH AN

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.512
OUTSIDE ENTITY PREFERRED LEAH A

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:31.781
LAW SCHOOL OR CLINIC THAT HAS A

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:33.616
HISTORY OF TRAINING ATTORNEYS TO

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:35.084
REPRESENT PEOPLE BEFORE THE

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:36.018
PROBOARDS.

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:38.354
AND TO HAVE THEM PROVIDE MORE OF

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:40.189
THE ADVOCACY BASED TRAINING SO

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:42.358
MORE OF THE YOU KNOW THIS IS HOW

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:44.593

TO REPRESENT YOUR CLIENT --

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:50.733
I DON'T THINK THE BOARD SHOULD

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.401
BE INVOLVED IN THAT AT ALL IT'S

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:54.303

BIASED -- WE

01:07:57.873 --> 01:07:58.908

ONE YOU INDICATED ONE OF THE

01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:12.988
BIGGEST CONCERNS WAS THE LACK OF

PREPARATION THE ATTORNEY ENGAGED

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:16.325
IN WITH THE INMATE.

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:18.027
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:19.462
BIT MORE WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT.

AROUND IN THE PRISONS THAT'S A

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:33.943
LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT WHAT

WHAT A PAROLE HEARING IS I HAVE

01:08:36.378 --> 01:08:37.480
A LOT OF TIME I'M KIND OF

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.715
CONFUSED WHY THAT'S SO DIFFICULT.

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:42.051
IT'S SOME IT'S A VERY YOU'RE

01:08:42.117 --> 01:08:43.118

WHO'S GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS

01:08:44.119 --> 01:08:45.521
AND NOT ON THE SECOND PANEL AND

01:08:45.588 --> 01:08:46.589
YOU COULD PROBABLY HEAR BEST

01:08:46.655 --> 01:08:48.791
FROM THEM BUT IT.

VERY LENGTHY PROCESS IT CAN BE

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:54.096
VERY CONFUSING --

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:54.897
THERE A LOT OF RIGHTS THAT ARE

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:56.966
INVOLVED THERE'S A LOT OF REVIEW

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.634
OF THEIR CENTRAL FILE SO THEY

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.669
CAN ACTUALLY SIT DOWN WITH THE

01:09:00.736 --> 01:09:01.937
INMATE TALK ABOUT.

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:03.205

THAT STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.102
TOOL AND IT INCLUDED TO SHOW

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:48.103
RESOURCES.

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:50.539
WE THINK THAT THE FRAME AT THE

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:52.541
DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK IDEA

01:11:52.608 --> 01:11:54.610
SEEMS PROMISING BUT WE NOTED

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:55.844

01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:57.446
LACKING FROM THE PROPOSAL.

01:11:57.513 --> 01:12:00.649

PERMISSION IS TO AND WHAT WE

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:05.054
FOUND LACKING WAS MORE

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.456
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROCESS --

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:09.258
AND TIMELINE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF

01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:12.027
THE TOOL HOW IT WILL BE USED AND

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:13.328
HOW IT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.697
EVALUATED.

01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:15.998
AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS AN

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:18.333
INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT NOT

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.069
ONLY FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT.

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:21.537
BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE FUNDING

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:23.539
REQUEST ASSUMES THE SUCCESSFUL

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:26.041
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRUCTURE

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.276
DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK.

01:12:27.342 --> 01:12:28.877
IN OTHER WORDS IT ASSUMES THAT

01:12:28.944 --> 01:12:30.512
THE FRAMEWORK WILL BE

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:32.081
IMPLEMENTED ON TIME AT THE

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:33.415
BEGINNING OF THE BUDGET YEAR AND

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:35.117
HAVE THE INTENDED --

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.186
EFFICIENCY --

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:39.121
A FACTOR STREAMLINING EFFECT ON

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:41.957
THE TIME THAT PRO HEARINGS TAKE --

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.125
IF IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT A FACT

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:44.526
OR IF THE IMPLEMENTATION IS

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:45.527
DELAYED IT'S POSSIBLE THE

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:47.329
DEPARTMENT MAY NEED MORE

01:12:47.396 --> 01:12:49.031
RESOURCES TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:50.599
ANTICIPATED PRO NUMBER PRO

01:12:50.666 --> 01:12:51.500
HEARINGS.

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:52.534
SO WE RECKON WE WITHHOLD

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.703
RECOMMENDATION AND RECOMMEND

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.205
DIRECTING SEE SHARED PROVIDE KEY

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:57.840
INFORMATION BY APRIL FIRST AND A

01:12:57.906 --> 01:13:02.144
PROTOTYPE OF THE TOOL FOR THE

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.545
LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW.

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:04.646
AND THEN ON THE PROPOSAL TO

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:05.814
RAISE COMPENSATION FOR ATTORNEYS

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:07.549
APPOINTED BY THE BOARD.

01:13:07.616 --> 01:13:09.585
WE THINK THAT A NEW PATIENT

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.220
ARCHER DOES APPEAR NEEDED BUT

01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:12.688
AGAIN WE FOUND THE PROPOSAL TO

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:14.556
BE LACKING SOME KEY INFORMATION

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:16.191
WHICH AGAIN AGAIN AS DESCRIBED

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:17.693
IN MORE DETAIL IN YOUR AGENDA.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.961
BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL WOULDN'T

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:21.196
FEEL LIKE AS AS IF THERE WAS A

01:13:21.263 --> 01:13:22.998
CLEAR BASIS FOR THE SEVEN

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.867
HUNDRED DOLLAR --

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:26.401
PAYMENT OR INK --

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:29.371
THE REYES FROM A HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:32.207
PER CASE --

01:13:32.274 --> 01:13:34.943
OR CLEAR BASIS FOR OUR OR CLEAR

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:36.512
INFORMATION THAT I SHOULD SAY

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:37.346
ABOUT THAT WHAT THE NEW

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:38.647
STRUCTURE OF THE PAY SCHEDULE

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:40.048
WOULD BE OR THE CHANGES TO

01:13:40.115 --> 01:13:42.084
RECRUITMENT TRAINING AND

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:44.353
EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE ATTORNEYS --

01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:45.320
SO WE RECOMMEND DIRECTING THE

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:46.889
DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE THE KEY

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:48.791
INFORMATION BY APRIL FIRST --

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:50.592
AND IF IT IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.094
THE INFORMATION WE RECOMMEND

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:53.762
REJECTING THE PROPOSAL AND

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:54.396
HAVING THE DEPARTMENT COME BACK

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:54.863
NEXT YEAR [inaudible]

01:13:54.930 --> 01:14:02.037
OKAY -- ONE

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:03.939
SEVENTY QUESTIONS THE SYSTEM.

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:04.506
JUST A COMMENT ON THAT THE

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:06.475
STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING TO IT

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:07.709
I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.578
SOMETHING THAT THAT IS VERY

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:09.912
APPROPRIATE.

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:12.881
AND MY PROVIDE SOME OF THE VA

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.383
SOME BUT I THINK THAT.

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:15.784
THAT WE NEED THOSE REALLY

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:18.520
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS AND HOW

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:20.222
IT GETS IMPLEMENTED THAT HOW

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:21.390
QUICKLY GETS IMPLEMENTED.

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:22.791
IT SOUNDS LIKE EVEN THOUGH YOU

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:25.561
CAN'T PUT TOGETHER THAT PROPOSAL

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:28.263
GETTING ALL OF THE COMMISSIONERS

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:29.097
TRAINS.

01:14:29.164 --> 01:14:30.499
AND CHANGING HOW THEY'VE BEEN

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:31.900
MAKING DECISIONS MIGHT TAKE A

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:33.602
LITTLE BIT LONGER.

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:35.204
SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE GET SOME

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.538
SOME INTERACTION WITH THAT.

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:39.441
AND RATHER THAN I UNDERSTAND THE

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:40.909
NOTION OF WAITING UNTIL NEXT

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:43.011
YEAR BUT I DON'T KNOW THE DATE

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:43.612
WE HAVE THE TIME TO WAIT TILL

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:44.446
NEXT YEAR.

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:46.114
BUT RATHER THAN PUTTING

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:47.916
SOMETHING FORWARD THAT WE DON'T

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.585
NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND IN THERE

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:51.053
SOME DANGERS TO SOMETHING THAT'S

01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:52.855
VERY FORMULAIC WHICH I KNOW

01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:54.456
YOU'RE NOT SO TALKING ABOUT YEAH

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:55.657
BUT IF YOU BECOMES FORMULAE CAN

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:57.693
BECOMES KIND OF COOKIE CUTTER

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:58.227
AND THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO

01:14:58.293 --> 01:14:59.595
ACCOUNT.

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:01.430
THE THE DIFFERENCES OF THE

01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:02.831
INDIVIDUALS THERE AND I KNOW

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:04.433
RIGHT THAT'S NOT CHOI HOUSES I

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.567
BUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:07.102
WOULD BENEFIT FROM A LITTLE BIT

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.737
MORE INFORMATION.

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.305
OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:12.107
HOW IT WORKS HOW WOULD BE

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:14.443
DEALING WITH THE VARIETIES OF

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:17.346
SITUATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS THAT?

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:19.481
THAT WE WOULD BE DEALING WITH

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:20.148
BUT I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THIS

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:22.117
BUT I THINK THAT WE DO NEED THAT

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:23.185
INFORMATION.

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:26.221
AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND THEN.

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:28.423
BUILD INTO IT SOME FEEDBACK

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:29.892
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SO THAT THIS

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.860
COMMITTEE HAS A SENSE OF ORGAN

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:33.195
INVEST IN THIS.

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:34.796
HAS A SENSE OF HOW IT'S GOING

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:36.698
WHAT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ARE

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:37.833
WHAT IMPLEMENTATION LOOKS LIKE

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.201
HEY THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:40.435
SO WE DO HAVE MONTHLY BOARD

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:44.339
EXECUTIVE A PUBLIC SESSIONS AND

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:46.742
EVERY MONTH FROM HERE ON OUT --

01:15:46.808 --> 01:15:49.011
WE WILL BE PROVIDING UPDATES AS

01:15:49.077 --> 01:15:51.380
TO HOW THIS IS DEVELOPING.

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:53.615
I WILL CAUTION FOLKS.

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:55.517
ADMITTEDLY WE ARE FAST TRACKING

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:56.652
THIS --

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:58.153
BECAUSE WE DID NOT WANT TO

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.755
EXPAND THE BOARD SO.

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:01.790
IT'S GOING A NEEDS TO GO UNDER

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:03.959
GO I'M NOT SURE APRIL FIRST WILL

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:04.660
HAPPEN.

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:07.229
BUT I'M DEFINITELY APRIL --

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:10.065
WE ACTUALLY HAVE SCHEDULED --

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:12.301
TO NOT CONDUCT HEARING STATEWIDE

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:13.535
APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH AND TWENTY

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:14.603
NINTH OR TWENTY NINTH AND

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:15.904
THIRTIETH WHATEVER THAT MONDAY

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:17.773
AND TUESDAY ARE. TO DO TRAINING

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:19.074
ON THIS TO ALL OF OUR HEARING

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:20.909
OFFICERS WE WILL IN HAVE A FEW

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:23.745
MONTHS. TO PILOT IT.

01:16:23.812 --> 01:16:26.448
AND TWEAK IT IS NECESSARY TO SEE

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:28.350
HOW IT'S WORKING AND WHAT THE

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.252
ISSUES ARE BEFORE WE SEE THE

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:32.321
INCREASES IN IN SCHEDULED

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:33.188
HEARINGS.

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:34.957
SO THERE IS KIND OF A STEPPING

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:38.126
PROCESS AND WE WILL BE

01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:39.194
PRESENTING AT PUBLICLY.

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:40.562
JUST TO PUT A LAY SOME OF YOUR

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:42.631
CONCERNS IT IS NOT A FORMULA

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:44.533
THERE'S NO NUMBERS ASSOCIATED

01:16:44.599 --> 01:16:45.334
WITH IT.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.368
KIND OF THE DESIGN OF THE TOOL

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:47.336
THE WAY HE PUTS IT WHICH MAKES

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.538
SENSE TO ME IF EVERYTHING IF

01:16:49.604 --> 01:16:51.073
EVERYONE OF THESE KEY DOMAINS

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:52.908
COMES UP AS AGGRAVATED AND

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:53.642
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT GRANTING

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:54.576
PAROLE.

01:16:54.643 --> 01:16:55.410
YOU NEED TO STOP AND REALLY

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:57.846
THINK ABOUT IT THIS IT'S NEEDS

01:16:57.913 --> 01:16:59.047
TO ADD UP AND MAKE SENSE

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:00.482
CONVERSELY IF EVERYTHING IS

01:17:00.549 --> 01:17:01.850
MITIGATING AND YOU'RE THINKING

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:02.985
ABOUT DENYING.

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:04.486
YOU NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:06.455
IT AND THERE IS ONE OF THE ONE

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:07.889
OF THE SIGNIFICANT DOMAINS THAT

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.257
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT

01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:09.825
UNDER THE TOOL IS A FENDER

01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:12.027
CHANGE SO IT WILL BE VERY

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:13.528
OFFENDER SPECIFIC.

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:14.997
AND WE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT TAKE

01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:16.365
AWAY THE PORTION OF OUR HEARING

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:18.900
WHICH WE THINK IS MOST IMPORTANT.

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.302
HOW HAS THIS INMATE TRANSFORMED

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:21.737
WHO ARE THEY TODAY AND HOW ARE

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:23.038
THEY DIFFERENT FROM WHO THEY

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:23.672
WERE WHEN THEY COMMITTED THEIR

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:24.840
CRIMES?

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:26.274
SO THAT PART WILL NOT ADMITTEDLY

01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:27.642
THIS IS NOT HOW WE WOULD

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:29.611
NORMALLY DO BUSINESS IT WOULD BE

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:32.080
MUCH MORE PROTRACTED WE JUST SAW

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:33.682
THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:17:33.749 --> 01:17:34.383
YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S DO IT

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:36.151
SIMILAR TO WHEN WE MIGHT

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:37.819
PAPERLESS THERE WAS NO PLAN B..

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:39.588
BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD NOT.

01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:40.722
THEY WOULDN'T CONVERT TO WRITE

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:42.024
SO -- TO A

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.291
CERTAIN EXTENT.

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:45.527
THERE IS THERE IS A RISK FACTOR

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:47.396
ADMITTEDLY TO THIS.

01:17:47.462 --> 01:17:48.230
WHICH IS WHY SUCH I'M ASKING

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:49.898
THAT YOU NOT GET TOO FAR AHEAD

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:51.900
OF THE YES TO BE DOING PUBLIC

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:52.768
HEARINGS.

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:54.436
GIVEN OUR SCHEDULES WE MAY OR

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:56.038
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE

01:17:56.104 --> 01:17:57.806
IN THOSE SO COULD KEEP A LITTLE

01:17:57.873 --> 01:17:59.508
BIT CLOSER LETTING US KNOW

01:17:59.574 --> 01:18:00.942
WHAT'S GOING ON CHALLENGE ME

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:02.811
WOULD GIVE US A LOT MORE COMFORT

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:04.246
IF WE'RE GOING TO BE.

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:07.449
INVESTING IN A CHANGE YES AND

WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT --

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:26.701
THE SECOND PANEL IS SOMEONE FOR

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:27.369

SO I HAVE REALLY BEEN PRESENT

FOR THE THE DEVELOPMENTS IN IN

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:25.961
IN PAROLE WHEN I STARTED DOING

THESE HEARINGS --

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:28.396
THE GRANT RATE WAS

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:30.465
EXTRAORDINARILY LOW --

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:31.299
THE MOST DESERVING CLIENTS ARE

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:31.867
NOT.

01:19:31.933 --> 01:19:33.068
BEING FOUND SUITABLE FOR PRO

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:33.902
THERE WAS ALMOST NO HOPE OF

01:19:33.969 --> 01:19:35.237
REALLY BEING FOUND SUITABLE FOR

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:35.937
PAROLE AND IT WAS REALLY A

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:37.672
CRAPSHOOT WE BROUGHT A LOT OF

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:39.441
LEGAL CHALLENGES UNDER THE IN

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:40.876

BROWN BECOMING THE GOVERNOR AND

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:46.781
MYSTERY FOR TAKING OVER THE

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:48.183
BOARD -- WE

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.484
STARTED TO SEE --

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:50.719
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS

01:19:50.785 --> 01:19:52.220
INCREASES TRANSPARENCY

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:53.388
COLLABORATION --

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:54.956
AND A REAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE

01:19:55.023 --> 01:19:56.925
PROPUESTAS SO BEFORE I WENT INTO

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:58.960
MY CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS

01:19:59.027 --> 01:19:59.995
FOR WHAT COULD BE BETTER OR

01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:01.663
DIFFERENT I DO WANNA --

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:03.398
REALLY GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO THAT

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:04.766
WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA TODAY

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:06.535
IS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT THAN

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:08.069
WHAT WE HAD GOING ON IN

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:08.703
CALIFORNIA TEN OR TWELVE YEARS

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:09.938
AGO -- I

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:11.773
ALSO DO A LOT OF WORK INSIDE THE

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.441
PRISONS DOING WORKSHOPS I'VE

01:20:13.508 --> 01:20:15.010
BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THE

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:16.478
THE LAWS THAT HAVE --

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:17.913
EXPANDED THE PROPOSED SAYS

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.347
EXPANDED IT FOR YOUTH OFFENDERS

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:21.616
AND I'VE BEEN INSIDE MANY OF THE

01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:23.418
PRISONS IN CALIFORNIA PRESENTING

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:28.957
TO PEOPLE ON WHAT IT TAKES TO BE --

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:31.960
SHIFT IN PEOPLE IN IN IN MEN AND

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:33.595
WOMEN INSIDE PRISONS WANTING TO

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.330
CHANGE AND GROW AND REHABILITATE

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:36.831
AND DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:38.366
IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED IN MY

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:40.168
OPINION TO THE FACT THAT THE

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:41.870
PAROLE BOARD IS WORKING VERY

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:43.004
HARD TO TRY TO SEND THE RIGHT

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:44.005
PEOPLE HOME AND DOING A PRETTY

01:20:44.072 --> 01:20:45.473
GOOD JOB OF SENDING.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.975
THE RIGHT PEOPLE HOME SO I WILL

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:52.581
START WITH THAT --

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:55.550
I HAVE MY I HAVE I HAVE.

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:56.785
SOME -- I

01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:58.053
THINK MY BIGGEST I'VE BEEN

01:20:58.119 --> 01:20:59.487
SAYING THIS TO MISS SCHAEFER AND

01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:01.022
BEFORE MISS A FOR WAS THE THE

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:02.591
EXECUTIVE OFFICER THAT THE

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:04.092
BIGGEST --

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:06.328
FACTOR IN SOMEONE GETTING A FAIR

01:21:06.394 --> 01:21:07.629
PAROLE HEARING IS HAVING A GOOD

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.464
ATTORNEY I WANT TO SPEND JUST A

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:10.966
MINUTE EXPLAINING TO WHAT.

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.234
IN OUR PROJECT WE DO WHEN WE

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.768
REPRESENT PEOPLE IN THE PRO

01:21:13.835 --> 01:21:15.670
PROCESS WE'VE HAD ABOUT A

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:16.571
HUNDRED AND FIFTY CLIENTS

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:17.739
RELEASED THROUGH THE LIFE

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:19.140
APPROVAL PROCESS.

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:21.042
THE GRANT RATE FOR OUR PROJECT

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:23.945
IT RUNS AROUND 7275% OF OUR

01:21:24.012 --> 01:21:25.113
CLIENTS ARE GRANTED PAROLE WHEN

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.147
THEY GO HEARING.

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:27.882
AND WE DO NOT SELECT THE PEOPLE

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:28.917
WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO GET

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:30.385
PAROLE OR WHO HAVE.

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:31.820
ACCOMPLISHED THE MOST PERFECT

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:33.622
CHANGE WE REALLY HAVE A RANGE OF

01:21:33.688 --> 01:21:35.156
CLIENTS --

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:36.658
BUT WE HAVE THE LUXURY OF OUR

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:39.361
STUDENTS SPENDING MANY HOURS

01:21:39.427 --> 01:21:40.295

PAROLE HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.398
THE PROCESS.

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:45.033
GAINING THEIR TRUST --

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.035
AND MAKING SURE THEY ARE READY

01:21:47.102 --> 01:21:48.336
TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:49.838
PUT TO THEM IN THE IN THE PRO

01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:51.072
PROCESS.

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:52.941
IS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE MANY PEOPLE

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:55.710
IN THE PRISON SYSTEM COGNITIVE

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.412
CHALLENGES HAVE CHALLENGES THAT

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:58.913
COME FROM TRAUMA BEING RAISED IN

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:01.116
TRAUMA HAVE VERBAL PROCESSING

DISORDERS AND HAVE ALL KINDS OF

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:04.886
OF ISSUES.

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:06.221
THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE

01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:07.589
APPARENT IN A PRO PROCESS BUT

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:09.257
WOULD INHIBIT THEM FROM GOING

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:10.558
INTO THE BOARD ROOM AND TALKING

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:11.793
ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:12.794
TALK ABOUT.

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:14.729
SO I ECHO ISTY FOR HIS COMMENT

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:16.031
ABOUT ATTORNEY PAROLE

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:18.333
REPRESENTATION THE CRITICAL THE

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.502
MOST VALUE AN ATTORNEY CAN ADD

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:21.569
TO THE PROCESS.

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:22.971
IS THE TIME SPENT WITH THEIR

01:22:23.038 --> 01:22:25.106
CLIENT PRIOR TO THE HEARING

01:22:25.173 --> 01:22:26.308
MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTAND

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:27.108
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE

01:22:27.175 --> 01:22:27.942
HEARING.

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:29.110
EARNING THEIR TRUST SO THEY CAN

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:30.345
TALK ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:31.513
THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED

01:22:31.579 --> 01:22:33.281
CHILDHOOD TRAUMA CAUSATIVE

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:34.516
FACTORS --

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:36.785
SEXUAL ABUSE ADDICTION AND THE

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:38.286
THINGS THAT LED TO THE VIOLENCE

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:39.287
BEING ABLE TO HONESTLY AND

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:40.755
OPENLY DISCUSS THE VIOLENCE THAT

01:22:40.822 --> 01:22:41.990
THEY PERPETRATED BOTH WHAT

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:42.891
THEY'VE BEEN CAUGHT FOR WHAT

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:44.025
THEY'VE NOT BEEN.

01:22:44.092 --> 01:22:46.261
CAUGHT FOR AND THEN BEING ABLE

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:47.929
TO DISCUSS THEIR CHANGE --

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:48.797
ONCE YOU'RE IN THE BOARDROOM

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:49.731
OBVIOUSLY HAVING A STRONG

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:50.832
ATTORNEY WHO KNOWS THE LAW AND

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:52.167
WILL FIGHT FOR YOU MATTERS IT

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:53.401
CAN I THINK IT KEEPS THE

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:54.769
COMMISSIONERS --

01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:56.705
IN THEIR LANE AND FOLLOWING THE

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:59.107
RULES AND AND PAYING ATTENTION

01:22:59.174 --> 01:22:59.741
TO EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO PAY

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:00.542
ATTENTION.

01:23:00.608 --> 01:23:02.010
TO BUT THE TRAVEL TO AND FROM%

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:04.012
THE PRISON THE FAMILIARITY WITH

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:06.247
THE LARGE PRISON FILE AND THE

01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:08.550
RECORDS RELATED TO THE CRIME --

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:10.018
AND THE CLIENT PREPARATION IS

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:10.885
WHAT'S CRITICAL AND PAROLE

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:13.221
REPRESENTATION MY COMMENT WOULD

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:14.456
BE THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:16.358
DOLLARS EVEN WHEN YOU.

01:23:16.424 --> 01:23:21.429
AGGREGATE ALL OF THE ANY FIRST

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:22.831
OF ALL THAT'S DIFFICULT IT'S

01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:24.699
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO MORE THAN A

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:25.800
COUPLE OF HEARINGS A WEEK AND

01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:27.102
MORE THAN TWO A DAY.

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:29.237
ON IN MY OPINION BUT SEVEN

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:30.105
HUNDRED DOLLARS DOESN'T EVEN

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:31.873
COME CLOSE TO COVERING WHAT

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.942
SOMEONE REALLY NEEDS --

01:23:34.008 --> 01:23:35.643
IN TERMS OF BEING FOR THE FOR

THE PRO BOARD PRIVATE ATTORNEYS

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:39.581
RATES I THINK I MISSED ABOUT THE

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:41.349
COMPOSITE SPEAK TO THIS BETTER

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:41.950
THAN I CAN.

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:43.852
VERY WOULD SAY FROM 300-021-0000

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:48.490
STUDY THAT A SOURCE FELLOW OUT

FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE RETAINED

01:23:55.029 --> 01:23:56.731
ATTORNEYS COMPARED TO THE GREAT

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:58.566

THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:04.239
SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE.

01:24:04.305 --> 01:24:05.140
IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE PEOPLE WHO

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:07.008

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:07.976
TO GET IT A PAROLE DATE AND YOU

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:08.943
TAKE WITH PEOPLE WHO ALMOST

CERTAINLY WILL GET A PRO DATE.

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:11.746
THAT SORT OF MIDDLE GROUP WHERE

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:13.181
THERE'S SOME GRAY THE GRANT

WORKING FOR THEM.

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:22.557
AND IT'S IT'S A COMBINATION OF

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:23.191
FACTORS HAVING MISSED A FOR DID

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:24.325
A GOOD JOB OF OUTLINING FEW SOME

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:26.094
OF THE PROBLEMS THE FACT THAT

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:28.163
THE BOARD ITSELF.

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:30.665
HIRES SUPERVISES --

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:32.934
AND PAYS AND IT IS IS OBVIOUSLY

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:33.835
A YOU KNOW A HUGE PROBLEM I

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:34.636
DON'T NEED TO GO INTO THE

01:24:34.702 --> 01:24:36.137
DETAILS ON THAT I THINK

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:37.505
SEPARATING THOSE FUNCTIONS WOULD

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:37.972
BE.

01:24:38.039 --> 01:24:39.441
WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT I THINK

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:40.875
THE YOU KNOW THERE'S LIMITS IN

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:41.776
THE KIND OF TRAINING THAT THE

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:43.077
BOARD CAN --

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:44.746
PROVIDE BECAUSE YOU ARE TRAINING

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:46.047
PEOPLE TO LITIGATE SORT OF

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:47.348
LITIGATE AGAINST YOU I MEAN

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:50.919
ESSENTIALLY LITIGATE AGAINST YOU --

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:51.519
MISTER WELL AND I'VE TEAMED UP

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:54.055
TO DO TRAINING FOR THE GOODNESS

01:24:54.122 --> 01:24:55.657
OF OUR HEARTS WE'RE BOTH REALLY

01:24:55.723 --> 01:24:56.791
BUSY WE HAVEN'T DONE IT FOR A

01:24:56.858 --> 01:24:57.992
FEW YEARS IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S

01:24:58.059 --> 01:24:59.360
ONEROUS IT'S HARD TO GET THE

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:01.296
ATTORNEYS TO ATTEND --

01:25:01.362 --> 01:25:03.498
I COULD REGALE YOU WITH STORIES

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:05.233
OF PEOPLE I'VE MET IN PRISON AND

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.367
CLIENTS HAD TAKEN OVER THEIR

01:25:06.434 --> 01:25:07.702
CASES THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:09.137
BOARD LAWYERS --

01:25:09.204 --> 01:25:09.737
THAT SOMETIMES JUST MAKE ME

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:10.839
WANNA CRY --

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:12.640
IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT THAT

01:25:12.707 --> 01:25:13.241
THEY'RE ALL BAD AND IT'S NOT

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:14.742
THAT THERE ARE NOT WORKING HARD

01:25:14.809 --> 01:25:15.643
BUT THERE ARE SOME.

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.046
TERRIBLE TERRIBL STORIES ABOUT

01:25:18.112 --> 01:25:19.347
THE LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION THAT

01:25:19.414 --> 01:25:20.715
SOMEONE CAN EXPECT TO GET WITH

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:22.083
THE BOARD APPOINTED ATTORNEY.

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:23.818
SO I COMMEND THE EFFORT TO

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:25.153
IMPROVE THE REPRESENTATION I

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.821
DON'T THINK SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:25:26.888 --> 01:25:28.122
DOLLARS IS ENOUGH --

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:29.791
I THINK IT'S A START BUT I THINK

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:31.292
THAT THIS COMMITTEE MOVING

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:31.926
FORWARD SHOULD BE LOOKING AT A

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:32.794
BIGGER.

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:34.229
BROADER SOLUTION TO THAT

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:36.331
SITUATION AND IN IN THIS YOU

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:38.132
KNOW WHAT IN TERMS OF THINKING

01:25:38.199 --> 01:25:39.601
ABOUT COST --

01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:41.669
A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE IN

01:25:41.736 --> 01:25:43.972
PRISON SEEKING PAROLE THAT FIRST

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:44.539
PAROLE HEARING BECAUSE THEY

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.307
DON'T HAVE GOOD REPRESENTATION

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:47.609
IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:48.810
THEY POSE A DANGER TO THE

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:49.844
COMMUNITY IT'S THAT THEY'RE JUST

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:50.979
NOT READY TO PRESENT THEIR

01:25:51.045 --> 01:25:52.213
NARRATIVE TO THE BOARD.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.381
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A LEARNING

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:55.216
EXPERIENCE FOR THEM AND THEN

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:56.417
THEY GET THEIR THREE DENIAL AND

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:57.452
THEY HAVE TO GO BACK FOR A

01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:58.887
SECOND HEARING WHICH IS ALSO

01:25:58.953 --> 01:26:00.889
HUGELY EXPENSIVE TO THE STATE --

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:02.023
WE GO IN THE WE GOING TO

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:03.391
WORKSHOPS IN THE PRISONS WITH MY

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:05.260
LAW STUDENTS AND EIGHT IT'S NOT

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:06.628
UNCOMMON FOR MEDIA COMMENT FROM

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:07.829
THE STUDENT LIKE WE COULD GET

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:08.830
HIM A DATE.

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:10.131
BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO

01:26:10.198 --> 01:26:11.533
GET A DATE THE FIRST TIME AROUND

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:12.133
WITH HIS BOARD ATTORNEY HAVE

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.568
PROBABLY GET FOUND SUITABLE THE

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:14.702
SECOND TIME AROUND BECAUSE HE'S

01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:15.570
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

01:26:15.637 --> 01:26:16.571
THE PROCESS HE DOESN'T HOW TO

01:26:16.638 --> 01:26:17.138
PRESENT HIMSELF HE DOESN'T

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:18.206
UNDERSTAND.

01:26:18.273 --> 01:26:20.775
THAT BEING HONEST ABOUT.

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:24.779
YOU KNOW HE FROM.

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:28.449
CHILDHOOD TRY COULD REALLY HELP

01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:30.718
INSTEAD OF HER HIM OR BEING OPEN

01:26:30.785 --> 01:26:32.253
ABOUT THE MISCONDUCT YOU KNOW

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.655
DIFFERENT THINGS --

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:36.691
SO I I ECHO THE NEED FOR AN

IMPROVEMENT IN ATTORNEY

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.394
REPRESENTATION I THINK IT'S THE

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.329
SINGLE LARGEST FACTOR THAT WILL

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:43.031
IMPROVE OUR PRO PROCESS LEAD TO

01:26:43.097 --> 01:26:44.098
MORE OF THE CREW THE RIGHT

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:45.967
PEOPLE BEING GRANTED PAROLE --

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.335
AND ULTIMATELY COULD HAVE THE

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:48.770
IMPACT OF REDUCING ON THE NUMBER

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:50.471
OF HEARINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE

01:26:50.538 --> 01:26:52.507
NECESSARY LET US HEAR FROM US TO

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:53.908

I I ORDINARILY PERVERT NOT A

01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:24.706
GROUP TO USE NOTES BUT I WANT TO

01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:26.407
MAKE SURE I PROVIDE CONTEXT AT

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:27.408
THAT AS I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT

01:27:27.475 --> 01:27:29.043
THIS BUDGET CHANGE RIPPLES

01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:30.478
REALLY BECOME RELEVANT --

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:32.480
AND MORE OBVIOUSLY RELEVANT TO

01:27:32.547 --> 01:27:32.814
ME -- FAIRLY

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.717
RECENTLY IT HAS TO DO WITH --

01:27:35.783 --> 01:27:37.018
FOR ONE OF THE WHAT I THINK IS

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:37.852
ONE OF THE MAIN QUESTIONS THIS

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:40.021
THIS BOARD SHOULD BE ASKING THIS

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:41.022
COMMITTEE SHOULD BE ASKING WHICH

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:42.290
IS -- WHY

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:45.393
SHOULD SHOULD WE GIVE THE BOARD?

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:48.429
MORE MONEY [inaudible] TWO TO

01:27:48.496 --> 01:27:49.564
FURTHER A PROCESS THAT HAS NEVER

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:51.399
REALLY PRODUCED THE STATUTORILY

01:27:51.466 --> 01:27:53.835
MANDATED RESULT.

01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:55.703
THE PENAL CODE SECTION THAT

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:58.640
GOVERNS THIS PROCESS IS.

01:27:58.706 --> 01:27:59.240
THIRTY FORTY ONE IT TELLS THE

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:00.742
BOARD TO NORMALLY GRANT PAROLE

01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:02.377
THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE APPEARS

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:04.212
FOR PAROLE.

01:28:04.278 --> 01:28:06.047
THE BOARD IS NEVER APPROACH THAT.

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:07.515
THAT RATE --

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:10.618
AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING

01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:11.919
IS THAT --

01:28:11.986 --> 01:28:13.688
THERE ARE THEIR APPROACHES HAVE

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:14.522
ALWAYS BEEN HOW DO WE HOLD MORE

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:15.990
HEARINGS NOT HOW DO WE RELEASE

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:17.225
MORE PEOPLE.

01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:19.494
AND THIS THIS TODAY'S PROPOSALS

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.197
IS VERY SIMILAR --

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:24.565
TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:26.300
FOR THE PROCESS FOR FOR GETTING

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:28.002
SOMEONE READY FOR THIS FOR FOR

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:29.137
HEARING -- I

01:28:29.203 --> 01:28:31.906
AM A LAWYER BY TRAINING BUT MOST

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:34.575
OF MY WORK WITH MY CLIENTS THIS

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:36.577
IS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE I'M A

01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:38.980
PRETTY GOOD LISTENER AND I'M OF

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:40.181
A COUNSELOR --

01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:41.149
I GUIDE THEM INTO THIS

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:44.385
INTROSPECT THE DRAMATIC

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:45.887
EXPERIENCES THEY HAD IN THEIR

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:47.355
THEIR OWN CHILDHOODS AND

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.057
ADOLESCENCE AND HOW THAT THEN

01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:51.325
IMPACT THEIR DECISIONS AND

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:53.294
ASSOCIATIONS AND AND ACTIONS.

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:54.595
LATER IN LIFE --

01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:56.831
WHAT I FIND IS THIS WORK TAKES

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:59.033
MONTHS --

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.435
SOMETIMES YEARS --

01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:02.570
BUT WE ARE FILLING A CRITICAL

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:04.338
GAP IN THE AVAILABLE PROGRAMS

01:29:04.405 --> 01:29:06.140
WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE

01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:07.842
OFTENTIMES PEOPLE HAVE NO ACCESS.

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:08.509
TO HELP ANSWERING THOSE

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:11.379
QUESTIONS NOR SAFE SPACE TO DO

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:13.481
THAT TO DO THAT WORK.

01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:15.850
AND WHAT I THE THE BUDGET CHANGE

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:18.286
PROPOSAL IDENTIFIES THE THE

01:29:18.352 --> 01:29:20.855
BOARD'S CURRENT PROGRAM GREAT

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:21.656
18%.

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:22.457
THEY HEARD THE SHAPER MENTION

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:24.358
THAT A HIGHER NUMBER TODAY --

01:29:24.425 --> 01:29:28.329
MAYBE THAT'S AN UPDATED NUMBER --

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:31.399
BUT OUR RESULTS TELL US THAT

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:33.735
WHAT WE'RE DOING --

01:29:33.801 --> 01:29:36.804
WORKS YOU KNOW WE HAVE --

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:38.072
AS BASS RUMBLE SAID.

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:39.373
OUR OUR RATES ARE PRETTY HIGH

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.008
LAST YEAR WE'RE 81% OF OUR

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:42.677
CLIENTS WERE GRANTED PAROLE IT'S

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:44.746
NOT BECAUSE WE CHOOSE THE BEST

01:29:44.812 --> 01:29:45.980
CLIENTS EITHER --

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:47.648
WE COULD JUST ASK THE PERSON WHO

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:48.950
I WORK WITH FOR TEN YEARS OF THE

01:29:49.016 --> 01:29:50.718
PERSON WHO HAVE MET WHEN HE WAS

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:52.520
ABOUT A GANG MEMBER THE SHOE OR

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:53.554
THE PERSON WHO HAD A HIGH

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:54.689
PROFILE CASE FOR THE PERSON

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:56.424
WHO'S -- WHO

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:57.925
STEADFASTLY DENIED GUILT?

01:29:57.992 --> 01:29:59.594
ON HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT IN THE

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:02.263
PAROLE BOARD WE DON'T CHERRY

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:03.998
PICK.

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:06.100
IT'S BECAUSE WE DO THE WORK.

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:07.602
THAT HELPS OUR PLANTS ANSWER THE

01:30:07.668 --> 01:30:09.237
QUESTIONS THE PAROLE BOARD IS

01:30:09.303 --> 01:30:10.238
INTERESTED.

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:12.340
AND AGAIN WE'RE FILL AN

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:14.876
IMPORTANT GAP IN THAT --

01:30:14.942 --> 01:30:16.277
OF SOME OF MY COMMENTS ARE

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:18.780
FOCUSED ON ON THIS EFFORT TO

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:19.781
INCREASE.

01:30:19.847 --> 01:30:22.016
THE BOARDS ABILITY TO HOLD MORE

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:24.752
HEARINGS THEY THEY ARE ASKING

01:30:24.819 --> 01:30:25.286
FOR TWO MORE COMMISSIONER

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:25.953
POSITIONS.

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:29.390
THIS IS A A FAMILIAR REQUEST --

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:31.793
WAY BACK IN.

01:30:31.859 --> 01:30:32.360
TWO THOUSAND ONE THERE WAS A

01:30:32.426 --> 01:30:33.161
BACKLOG OF OVER TWO HEARINGS

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:34.962
THAT WAS DUE TO INEFFICIENCIES

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:36.430
IN SCHEDULING HEARINGS AND THE

01:30:36.497 --> 01:30:37.565
FACT THAT THE TIME IS MISS

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:38.466
ROMMEL NOTED.

01:30:38.533 --> 01:30:41.335
THE PROGRAM RATE WAS AROUND 1%.

01:30:41.402 --> 01:30:43.104
AT THAT TIME 1%.

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:44.105
AND THE GOVERNOR TO TIMES

01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:45.273
REVERSING ALMOST ALL THOSE BUT

01:30:45.339 --> 01:30:47.108
PROGRAM RAY THE BOARD WAS ABOUT

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:47.942
1%.

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:49.610
AND AT THE TIME THERE WERE NINE

01:30:49.677 --> 01:30:51.445
POSITIONS ON THE BOARD NINE

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:52.647
COMMISSIONERS --

01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:54.282
SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT

01:30:54.348 --> 01:30:56.250
PASS AND ALLOW THEM TO TO SPLIT

01:30:56.317 --> 01:30:57.685
PANEL SO YOU COULD HAVE ONE

01:30:57.752 --> 01:30:58.686
COMMISSIONER HERE CASE AND A

01:30:58.753 --> 01:30:59.921
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER.

01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:01.489
SO THEY COULD HEAR MORE TO TRY

01:31:01.556 --> 01:31:04.125
TO ELIMINATE THE BACK.

01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:05.793
THE BACKLOG HAD ACTUALLY

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.228
INCREASED.

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:08.329
TOPPING FOUR THOUSAND OVERDUE

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:09.997
CASES.

01:31:10.064 --> 01:31:11.299
SOME BY OVER TO BUY A YEAR OR

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:14.602
MORE -- AND

01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:16.204
IN THAT YEAR TWO THOUSAND FIVE

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:17.772
SENATE BILL SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:18.639
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

01:31:18.706 --> 01:31:19.240
COMMISSIONERS SO THEY COULD

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:20.374
CATCH UP.

01:31:20.441 --> 01:31:21.309
THEY WENT FROM NINE

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:22.844
COMMISSIONERS TO TWELVE

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:25.546
COMMISSIONERS AT THAT POINT.

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:27.448
THREE YEARS LATER THE BOARD

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:28.049
INCREASE THE NUMBER COMMISSION

01:31:28.115 --> 01:31:29.450
TO GET.

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:31.252
FROM.

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:32.420
TWELVE TO FIFTEEN NOW WHAT WHAT

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:33.888
I THOUGHT WAS REALLY INTERESTING

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:35.656
AT THAT TIME IN.

01:31:35.723 --> 01:31:36.290
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE BOOK WAS

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:38.359
PROJECTING ROUGHLY THE SAME

01:31:38.426 --> 01:31:41.629
NUMBER HEARINGS WOULD BE DO.

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:42.463
SEVENTY ONE HUNDRED AS THEY ARE

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:44.398
NOW SAYING WILL BE DUE NEXT YEAR

01:31:44.465 --> 01:31:44.699
[inaudible]

01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:46.601
OF SO.

01:31:46.667 --> 01:31:48.002
IN THE PROVIDE PROPOSED BUDGET

01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:49.370
FOR PROPOSED BUDGET THEY'RE

01:31:49.437 --> 01:31:50.037
ASKING FOR TWO MORE COMMISSIONER

01:31:50.104 --> 01:31:51.572
POSITIONS. TO HANDLE BASICALLY

01:31:51.639 --> 01:31:53.074
THE SAME NUMBER OF HEARINGS AS

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.842
WERE TO ELEVEN YEARS AGO --

01:31:54.909 --> 01:31:56.444
IN OTHER WORDS.

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:57.979
IS THIS CAR PROPOSAL.

01:31:58.045 --> 01:32:00.081
WITH IT THE NUMBER OF

01:32:00.147 --> 01:32:00.648
COMMISSIONS WILL HAVE NEARLY

01:32:00.715 --> 01:32:01.549
DOUBLED.

01:32:01.616 --> 01:32:04.652
FROM NINE TO SEVENTEEN OVER THE

01:32:04.719 --> 01:32:06.420
LAST FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:07.922
AND THEY'RE STILL PROPOSED THE

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:09.690
SAME SOLUTION.

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:11.492
MEANWHILE.

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:13.327
THE PROGRAM RATE.

01:32:13.394 --> 01:32:14.962
HAS NOW RISEN TO IT'S STILL

01:32:15.029 --> 01:32:17.965
BELOW 20%. 18% IS WHAT THEY'RE

01:32:18.032 --> 01:32:19.567
BUDGET CHANGE HOLES AS AT HOME

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:20.001
PAGE.

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:22.103
TEN UP AND NOT A SINGLE ONE OF

01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:24.138
THE PROPOSALS OVER THE LAST

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:25.106
FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS.

01:32:25.172 --> 01:32:30.111
HAS SUGGESTED A WAY TO INCREASE.

01:32:30.177 --> 01:32:33.481
THE MOST OBVIOUS FIX IS THE HAVE

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:34.048
FEWER PEOPLE GO THROUGH THE

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:35.016
PROCESS.

01:32:35.082 --> 01:32:36.717
BUT THEIR RESPONSE HAS BEEN TO

01:32:36.784 --> 01:32:39.754
DATE HOW DO WE JUST ADD MORE.

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:41.522
CAPACITY TO HEAR MORE CASES AND

01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:43.691
I SUGGESTTHAT THERE ARE WAYS TO

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:45.293
DO THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE WILL

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:47.361
OF THE TRAUMA WORK THAT WE DO.

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:50.431
WITH OUR WITH OUR CLIENTS --

01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:51.866
THAT WORK.

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:53.167
I WAS IS NOT JUST DEPEND ON THE

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:54.302
BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS BUT YOU

01:32:54.368 --> 01:32:55.803
KNOW YOU YOU HEARD LAST WEEK BUT

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:57.371
IN THE SAME COMMITTEE FROM A LOT

01:32:57.438 --> 01:32:58.239
OF PEOPLE WHO WERE.

01:32:58.306 --> 01:32:59.607
WHO PROVIDE SERVICES WITHIN THE

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:01.709
INSTITUTIONS OF DEALING WITH

01:33:01.776 --> 01:33:03.177
THIS TRUMP --

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:05.379
THE WORK MAKES A DIFFERENCE IT'S

01:33:05.446 --> 01:33:07.581
A CRITICAL MISSING PIECE AND I

01:33:07.648 --> 01:33:08.616
WOULD I WOULD URGE IS THAT THIS

01:33:08.683 --> 01:33:10.718
THAT THE EPA'S WORK WITH CDC R.

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:12.687
AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS TO

01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:14.622
ADDRESS THAT --

01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:16.390
AND THAT THE PROPOSAL ACTUALLY

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:18.259
REFLECT AN INTEREST IN --

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:19.894
EXPLORING THE WEIGHT OF TO

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:21.362
BETTER COMPLY WITH THE LAW NOT

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:24.265
JUST BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:25.299
RIGHT BUT ACTUALLY REQUIRE --

01:33:25.366 --> 01:33:26.100
AND I THINK IT'S A IT'S A MAJOR

01:33:26.167 --> 01:33:29.337
MISSING PIECE OF FROM THIS.

01:33:29.403 --> 01:33:32.840
I ALSO THINK THAT --

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:33.874
SOME PEOPLE SAY AND THEY'VE

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:35.509
THEY'VE TOLD ME THIS MANY TIMES

01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:36.811
BECAUSE I I'VE BEEN INVOLVED A

01:33:36.877 --> 01:33:38.379
LOT OF LITIGATION --

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:39.647
DEALING WITH THE PRO ABORT THIS

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:41.849
A LITIGATION IS THE WAY TO MOVE

01:33:41.916 --> 01:33:44.185
THAT NEEDLE. TWO OF TWO TO PUSH

01:33:44.251 --> 01:33:46.687
THE BOARD CLOSER TO GRANTING

01:33:46.754 --> 01:33:47.822
PAROLE MORE OFTEN --

01:33:47.888 --> 01:33:49.724
IN MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT --

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:51.292
AND THEY'VE BEEN HUNDREDS OF

01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:52.994
COURT CASES OVER THE YEARS

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.595
SUCCESSFUL ONES.

01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:55.062
THAT HAVE.

01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:56.597
IN THE LAST ALMOST TWENTY YEARS

01:33:56.664 --> 01:33:59.700
PUSH THE PROGRAM RATE FROM 1%

01:33:59.767 --> 01:34:01.469
218% -- IT

01:34:01.535 --> 01:34:03.237
CAN'T GET THEIR IT WILL NOT BE

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:04.271
ABLE TO GET THERE BY ITSELF BUT

01:34:04.338 --> 01:34:05.806
I THINK THAT.

01:34:05.873 --> 01:34:08.909
THROUGH OF BETTER COORDINATION

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.811
WE CAN GET FOR EXAMPLE A LITTLE

01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:11.912
LITIGATION IS.

01:34:11.979 --> 01:34:13.080
IT'S NOT ONLY NOT ENOUGH IT

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:14.181
ACTUALLY GETS IN THE WAY.

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:16.817
IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT

01:34:16.884 --> 01:34:19.687
CASES ARE USUALLY LITIGATED BY

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:21.589
YOU KNOW ON SKILLED LITIGANTS

01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:22.189
WITHOUT THE HELP OF COMPETENT

01:34:22.256 --> 01:34:23.457
COUNSEL.

01:34:23.524 --> 01:34:26.093
CLASS ACTIONS --

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.361
AT THE EVENTUAL UNFORTUNATELY

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:29.296
PRODUCED REALLY LIMITED RESULTS

01:34:29.363 --> 01:34:30.898
I THINK WELL HAVING A CHILLING

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:32.266
EFFECT.

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:34.635
ON OPEN DIALOGUE AND

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:35.770
COLLABORATIVE PROBLEMS UP.

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:37.271
AND SO I THINK THE SOLUTION LIES

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:38.372
IN IN --

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:40.341
LEGISLATION OTHER POLICY CHANGES

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:42.109
THAT WHAT WOULD WOULD CHANGE

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:43.978
THOSE THINGS.

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:47.181
I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT --

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:47.748
ABOUT THE STRUCTURE DECISION

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:50.251
MAKING -- I

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:52.219
APPRECIATE AND AGREE WITH THE LA

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:53.888
OWES OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE NEED

01:34:53.954 --> 01:34:55.322
FOR MORE INFORMATION.

01:34:55.389 --> 01:34:56.157
ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT

01:34:56.223 --> 01:34:57.558
IMPLEMENTATION TRAINING AND AND

01:34:57.625 --> 01:35:00.494
EVALUATION --

01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:02.630
IN DISCUSSING THE B. PAGES

01:35:02.696 --> 01:35:04.065
INTENTION TO INTRODUCE THIS

01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:05.699
MODEL.

01:35:05.766 --> 01:35:07.401
THEY SAY THAT --

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:08.869
IT IS.

01:35:08.936 --> 01:35:10.204
EVIDENCE BASED --

01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:13.674
BUT WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT

01:35:13.741 --> 01:35:14.775
SUPPORTS USE ON A POPULATION I

01:35:14.842 --> 01:35:16.277
CALIFORNIA'S LIFERS AND AND HOW

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:17.745
CAN YOU.

01:35:17.812 --> 01:35:18.946
HOW CAN YOU CLAIM IT CLAIM

01:35:19.013 --> 01:35:20.247
REALLY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS

01:35:20.314 --> 01:35:21.715
PROPOSED FRAME WORK WHEN YOU

01:35:21.782 --> 01:35:22.883
HAVEN'T YET CUSTOMIZE IT FOR

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:24.985
CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUES UNIQUE LAWS

01:35:25.052 --> 01:35:26.921
AND POPULATION WE DON'T REALLY

01:35:26.987 --> 01:35:27.788
KNOW ENOUGH --

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:29.223
YET AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:31.826
LEARNING LEARN A LOT MORE --

01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:33.327
I'D ALSO NOTE THAT WITH THE

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:34.762
STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:36.530
PROCESS.

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:37.998
THEY'RE PROJECTING.

01:35:38.065 --> 01:35:38.699
THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:40.267
SCHEDULE ELEVEN HEARINGS PER

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:42.636
WEEK AT LEVEL TWO AND THREE

01:35:42.703 --> 01:35:43.871
PRISONS AND FOURTEEN HEARINGS.

01:35:43.938 --> 01:35:45.239
HELLO FOR PRISONS.

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:47.208
WHICH IS ACTUALLY FEWER HEARINGS

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:48.809
THAN THEY WERE HOLDING EACH LEE

01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:49.844
EACH WEEK WHEN THE BACK WHILE I

01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:51.912
WAS AT FOUR THOUSAND SO I DON'T

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:53.414
KNOW HOW THEY DO THAT I DON'T

01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:56.217
KNOW HOW THAT MATH WORKS --

01:35:56.283 --> 01:35:57.952
I LOOK FOR LEARNING MORE BUT

01:35:58.018 --> 01:35:59.186
FROM WHAT I SEE IT DOESN'T QUITE

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:03.023
WORK -- THE

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:06.594
THE THREE APPOINTMENT PROCESS.

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.895
I AGREE THAT THAT --

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:09.563
THEY HAVE A PROVIDE ENOUGH

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:10.097
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE

01:36:10.164 --> 01:36:11.966
CHANGES --

01:36:12.032 --> 01:36:12.433
WILL RESULT IN BETTER

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:13.767
REPRESENTATION --

01:36:13.834 --> 01:36:15.870
I KNOW THAT THEIR FEE SCHEDULE --

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:17.104
AS IT IS CALLED FOR SINGLE

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:18.706
INTERVIEW WITH THE CLIENT I HOPE

01:36:18.772 --> 01:36:20.407
THAT CHANGES --

01:36:20.474 --> 01:36:24.011
THEY PUT THEIR PAID --

01:36:24.078 --> 01:36:25.179
THAT FOR THE INTERVIEW WITH THE

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:26.647
CLIENT THEN THEY ARE FOR SHOWING

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:28.082
UP AT THE HEARING BUT YOU'VE

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:29.316
HEARD REALLY ALL OF US.

01:36:29.383 --> 01:36:32.353
AGREED THAT THE PART OF THE

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:34.188
PROCESS DURING WHICH ATTORNEYS

01:36:34.255 --> 01:36:35.923
HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT.

01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:37.825
IS IN THE LEAD UP TO THE HERE

01:36:37.892 --> 01:36:39.860
MONTHS SOMETIMES AN A AND R.

01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:41.495
CASES YEARS SOMETIMES --

01:36:41.562 --> 01:36:44.965
AND ONE THEIR COUPLE EASY

01:36:45.032 --> 01:36:46.667
CHANGES AYE IF THE EASY FEET

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:48.536
RELATIVELY EASY FIX. ONE IS THAT

01:36:48.602 --> 01:36:50.204
YOU IF YOU REQUIRE THE ATTORNEYS

01:36:50.271 --> 01:36:52.139
ACTUALLY REVIEW THE RISK

01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:53.641
ASSESSMENTS WITH THEIR CLIENTS.

01:36:53.707 --> 01:36:54.808
EARLY ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY HELP

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.410
THEM PREPARE FOR THE YEAR.

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:57.912
AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR

01:36:57.978 --> 01:36:59.547
THOSE WITH INTELLECTUAL

01:36:59.613 --> 01:37:02.850
DISABILITIES A MENTAL ILLNESS --

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:03.217
A COUPLE OTHER.

01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:05.152
QUICK WHAT I THINK A RELATIVELY

01:37:05.219 --> 01:37:08.455
EASY EASY FIXES --

01:37:08.522 --> 01:37:11.692
ONE IS -- TO

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:13.294
INCLUDE A BUDGET ITEM --

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.095
FOR TRANSLATING PAROLE HEARING

01:37:15.162 --> 01:37:17.198
TRANSCRIPTS AND RISK ASSESSMENTS

01:37:17.264 --> 01:37:17.731
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T SPEAK

01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:19.066
ENGLISH.

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:20.601
THE BOARD PROVIDES INTERPRETERS.

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:22.236
FOR THE HEARINGS BUT THEY DON'T

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:23.938
TRANSLATE RISK ASSESSMENTS OR

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:25.940
HEARING TRANSCRIPTS INTO A

01:37:26.006 --> 01:37:26.440
LANGUAGE THE PERSON CAN

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:27.174
UNDERSTAND.

01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:28.542
SO THEY'RE UNABLE TO TAKE

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:29.577
ADVANTAGE OF THE CRITICAL

01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:31.178
INFORMATION THOSE DOCUMENTS TO

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:32.279
IMPROVE THEIR CHANCES THE NEXT

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:33.981
TIME.

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:35.783
ANOTHER IDEA IS TO TO BETTER

01:37:35.849 --> 01:37:37.585
SUPPORT PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL

01:37:37.651 --> 01:37:39.053
DISABILITIES A MENTAL ILLNESS --

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:40.688
THAT CAN INVOLVE SPECIALLY

01:37:40.754 --> 01:37:42.056
TRAINED ATTORNEYS.

01:37:42.122 --> 01:37:42.856
ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR

01:37:42.923 --> 01:37:43.991
PSYCHOLOGISTS PREPARING RISK

01:37:44.058 --> 01:37:46.393
ASSESSMENTS AND MORE HELP WITH

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:48.028
POST RELEASE PLANNING --

01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:48.996
AND THEY SHOULD REALLY START BY

01:37:49.063 --> 01:37:51.098
TRACKING AND REPORTING HEARING

01:37:51.165 --> 01:37:52.366
OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE IN THESE.

01:37:52.433 --> 01:37:53.834
CATEGORIES --

01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:54.969
AND I'LL JUST CONCLUDE WITH WITH

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:56.870
WHAT I THINK ARE [inaudible]

01:37:56.937 --> 01:38:00.741
BROADER RECOMMENDATIONS --

01:38:00.808 --> 01:38:01.342
BECAUSE MUCH THE DISCUSSION I

01:38:01.408 --> 01:38:02.743
THINK.

01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:04.845
IT TENDS TO FOCUS ON WHAT.

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:05.746
COULD AMOUNT TO SORT OF TAKE IT

01:38:05.813 --> 01:38:06.580
AROUND THE TIKRIT AROUND THE

01:38:06.647 --> 01:38:08.115
EDGES OF PRO REFORM BUT I DO

01:38:08.182 --> 01:38:10.985
THINK -- IN

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:12.820
I WAS IN THIS IS THIS IS NOT A

01:38:12.886 --> 01:38:14.054
POLICY HEARING THIS IS ABOUT THE

01:38:14.121 --> 01:38:14.922
ABOUT THE BUDGET.

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:16.023
BUT IF WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:19.393
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE BOTTOM LINE.

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:21.362
AND IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY THERE

01:38:21.428 --> 01:38:22.997
COUPLE RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:24.531
ONE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE TIES

01:38:24.598 --> 01:38:26.900
INTO LAST WEEK'S HEARING --

01:38:26.967 --> 01:38:30.337
AND IT RECORD I RECOMMEND BETTER

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:32.406
COORDINATION BETWEEN BPH AND CDC

01:38:32.473 --> 01:38:34.041
ARE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:38:34.108 --> 01:38:35.476
PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE

01:38:35.542 --> 01:38:37.111
WITHIN THE PRISONS ARE IN LINE

01:38:37.177 --> 01:38:38.979
WITH THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE TO HEAL

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:40.748
FROM TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES.

01:38:40.814 --> 01:38:42.182
AND ADDRESS OTHER ISSUES BPH

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:43.817
WANTS TO SEE RESOLVED BEFORE

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:44.718
RELEASING THEM --

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:46.086
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT THERE

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:47.488
SHOULD BE WIDER SUPPORT FOR

01:38:47.554 --> 01:38:49.189
COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS TO COME

01:38:49.256 --> 01:38:50.891
IN AND FILL THAT GAP --

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:52.192
THAT'S WHAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE

01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:54.094
IN OUR SUCCESS RATE COMPARED TO

01:38:54.161 --> 01:38:54.528
OTHER ATTORNEYS --

01:38:54.595 --> 01:38:55.329
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:38:55.396 --> 01:38:56.897
I RECOMMEND THE USE OF SOCIAL

01:38:56.964 --> 01:38:58.499
WORKERS AND THERAPIST IN THE

01:38:58.565 --> 01:39:00.167
MONTHS AND YEARS LEADING UP TO

01:39:00.234 --> 01:39:01.302
PAROLE HEARINGS.

01:39:01.368 --> 01:39:03.404
IT'S A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT ROLE

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:04.738
THAN THE ATTORNEY.

01:39:04.805 --> 01:39:06.407
I HAVE ALMOST AS MANY SOCIAL

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:09.009
WORKERS ON MY TEAM IS THAT DO

01:39:09.076 --> 01:39:10.511
LAWYERS BUT LIKE --

01:39:10.577 --> 01:39:11.111
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE WORD

01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:12.012
COMES FROM.

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:13.080
AND THAT'S THE MISSED THE

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:14.381
BIGGEST GAP TO BE FILLED --

01:39:14.448 --> 01:39:15.449
AND THEN THE LAST THING IS IS

01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:16.817
THAT I RECOMMENDED THE BOARD

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:17.751
WORK WITH US TO DEVELOP A

01:39:17.818 --> 01:39:19.687
PROGRAM THAT ENSURES EFFECTIVE

01:39:19.753 --> 01:39:20.487
REPRESENTATION FOR THOSE

01:39:20.554 --> 01:39:23.657
APPEARING FOR FOR OF THE BOARD --

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:26.327
I THINK THE BETTER OUTCOME

01:39:26.393 --> 01:39:27.027
SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS WITH

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:29.763
TREMENDOUS COST SAVINGS OUR OUR

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:31.031
EFFORTS --

01:39:31.098 --> 01:39:33.600
WITH OUR CLIENTS WE'VE HAD TWO

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:34.568
HUNDRED ELEVEN OF OUR LIFE

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:36.103
SENTENCE CLIENTS RELEASED SO FAR.

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:37.338
EVERY YEAR THEY STAY OUT OF

01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:38.505
PRISON SAVE THE STATE SIXTEEN

01:39:38.572 --> 01:39:39.707
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:39:39.773 --> 01:39:42.042
JUST OUR GROUP --

01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:42.876
YOUR MISS RUMBLE TALK ABOUT

01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:44.345
THEIR NUMBERS THAT IT ADDS UP

01:39:44.411 --> 01:39:46.146
REALLY QUICKLY --

01:39:46.213 --> 01:39:47.581
SO WE'RE WE'RE INTERESTED IN IN

01:39:47.648 --> 01:39:49.083
DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOLUTIONS

01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:50.017
THAT THE SAME THING OVER.

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:53.620
THANK YOU THANK YOU MR MENDOZA

01:39:53.687 --> 01:39:55.656
YOU HAVE A COMMENT.

01:39:55.723 --> 01:39:56.557
YEAH I'LL TRY TO MAKE A BRIEF

01:39:56.623 --> 01:39:59.326
THANK YOU THANKS FOR YOUR TIME --

01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:01.295
JUST A BRIEF HISTORY AT THE AGE

01:40:01.362 --> 01:40:03.864
OF FIFTEEN I WAS ARRESTED TRIED

01:40:03.931 --> 01:40:05.666
AND CONVICTED AS AN ADULT.

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:06.834
SINCE IT'S TWO FIFTEEN TO LIFE

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.802
SENTENCE AND SPENT ALL MY TIME

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:10.404
IN ADULT PRISON --

01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:12.005
AND IS THE THIRD BEEN MENTIONED

01:40:12.072 --> 01:40:13.674
DURING THAT TIME --

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:15.743
BEFORE THE SHIFT IN THE BEACH

01:40:15.809 --> 01:40:16.844
BPH PROCESS.

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:18.278
THERE WAS A VERY NEGATIVE

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:21.081
MESSAGE SENT TO MOST PEOPLE THAT.

01:40:21.148 --> 01:40:22.449
YOU WOULD NEVER GO HOME BECAUSE

01:40:22.516 --> 01:40:23.417
OF CERTAIN.

01:40:23.484 --> 01:40:25.819
LEADERSHIP BECAUSE OF THE THE

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:27.254
WAY THAT THE BOARD WAS WAS

01:40:27.321 --> 01:40:29.289
MOSTLY MADE UP OF LAW

01:40:29.356 --> 01:40:30.657
ENFORCEMENT OF TIME.

01:40:30.724 --> 01:40:32.726
AND SO REALLY.

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:33.694
IN TRYING TO PREPARE FOR THE

01:40:33.761 --> 01:40:35.562
BOARD IT WAS A HOPELESS GOAL AT

01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:36.830
THAT TIME.

01:40:36.897 --> 01:40:40.000
IT SEEMS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:41.702
TO EVER EARN YOUR WAY HOME OR TO

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:43.170
PROVE THAT YOU WERE NO LONGER

01:40:43.237 --> 01:40:44.972
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO.

01:40:45.038 --> 01:40:45.472
MADE A REALLY REALLY BAD

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:47.474
DECISION --

01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:49.443
BUT AS TIME IS CHANGING THINGS

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:50.778
THAT CHANGED.

01:40:50.844 --> 01:40:52.479
OTHER HAVE BEEN A FEW THINGS

01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:54.515
THAT HAVE STAYED THE SAME AND

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:56.850
ONE OF THEM IS A C. FILE.

01:40:56.917 --> 01:40:57.985
ARE YOU SEE FOLLOW IT'S

01:40:58.051 --> 01:40:59.787
BASICALLY YOUR LIFE IN A FILE IN

01:40:59.853 --> 01:41:01.221
BLACK AND WHITE.

01:41:01.288 --> 01:41:03.190
AND IT'S A C. FILE THAT IS

01:41:03.257 --> 01:41:06.360
SUPPOSED TO BE GONE OVER --

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:08.495
BY AN ATTORNEY WHO IS GOING TO

01:41:08.562 --> 01:41:10.330
ADVOCATE FOR YOU --

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:13.867
ALL OF THE BOARD MEMBERS --

01:41:13.934 --> 01:41:15.769
TO REALLY BE ABLE TO ASSESS

01:41:15.836 --> 01:41:16.937
WHETHER YOU ARE.

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:18.639
NO LONGER THAT SAME INDIVIDUAL

01:41:18.705 --> 01:41:20.607
WHO MADE A REALLY BAD DECISION

01:41:20.674 --> 01:41:23.110
AND COMMITTED A CRIME.

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:24.278
AND THE DIFFICULT PART ABOUT

01:41:24.344 --> 01:41:25.879
THAT IS IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE

01:41:25.946 --> 01:41:28.315
ASSIGNED AN ATTORNEY MAYBE A

01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:29.383
HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS IF YOU'RE

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:31.685
LUCKY OR EVEN CLOSER TO YOUR

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:33.654
BOARD HEARING --

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:34.655
IT'S IT'S NOT ALONE IS NOT

01:41:34.721 --> 01:41:36.156
ENOUGH TIME TO REALLY GO OVER

01:41:36.223 --> 01:41:38.492
DECADES OF WHAT'S IN YOUR C.

01:41:38.559 --> 01:41:40.327
FILE. TO ASSESS YOU AS THE

01:41:40.394 --> 01:41:41.795
INDIVIDUAL WHO YOU ARE.

01:41:41.862 --> 01:41:43.630
IN PERSON --

01:41:43.697 --> 01:41:46.166
BEFORE THE BOARD --

01:41:46.233 --> 01:41:46.633
TO RELEASE GET IT THAT

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:48.469
ASSESSMENT --

01:41:48.535 --> 01:41:49.470
YOU KNOW THERE ARE FOR FOR

01:41:49.536 --> 01:41:52.039
MYSELF.

01:41:52.105 --> 01:41:53.474
I DID EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:55.909
THAT I COULD. TO WRITE MANY MANY

01:41:55.976 --> 01:41:57.411
LETTERS ASKING.

01:41:57.478 --> 01:41:58.912
ANY ATTORNEY THAT WOULD TAKE MY

01:41:58.979 --> 01:42:00.514
CASE PRO BONO.

01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:02.382
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID OF OF A

01:42:02.449 --> 01:42:04.184
STATE APPOINTED ATTORNEY --

01:42:04.251 --> 01:42:05.919
HEARING EVERYTHING THAT I WOULD

01:42:05.986 --> 01:42:07.254
HEAR FROM --

01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:10.457
MANY MEN WHO WERE INSIDE WITH ME

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:12.993
ABOUT THEIR HORROR STORIES THAT

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.361
THEY WOULD HAVE.

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:15.729
WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE OF A STATE

01:42:15.796 --> 01:42:17.231
APPOINTED ATTORNEY --

01:42:17.297 --> 01:42:19.366
THEY WOULD BE LUCKY TO SEE THEM

01:42:19.433 --> 01:42:21.768
ONCE BEFORE THE BOARD HEARING --

01:42:21.835 --> 01:42:23.737
THEY WOULD TELL ME ABOUT HOW

01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:26.106
UNPREPARED SOME OF BOARD TURNS

01:42:26.173 --> 01:42:27.708
WOULD BE --

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:29.776
NOT ALL OF THEM WERE REALLY.

01:42:29.843 --> 01:42:32.045
ADD TO THAT PART BUT I DIDN'T

01:42:32.112 --> 01:42:34.114
WANT EXPERIENCE THAT.

01:42:34.181 --> 01:42:36.049
AND SO I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:38.452
HAVE. TWO ATTORNEYS ON BOTH MY

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:40.921
HERE IS THAT WERE PRO BONO --

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:41.989
AND BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM MORE

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:43.357
THAN ONCE --

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:44.892
WAS VERY VERY VERY HELPFUL FOR

01:42:44.958 --> 01:42:45.526
ME.

01:42:45.592 --> 01:42:46.860
IT ALLOW ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:42:46.927 --> 01:42:49.096
BE ABLE [inaudible]

01:42:49.162 --> 01:42:51.064
TO PREPARE HOW.

01:42:51.131 --> 01:42:52.866
MY ANSWERS WILL BE IN TERMS OF

01:42:52.933 --> 01:42:54.535
REAL INSIGHT THE REAL DRAMATIC

01:42:54.601 --> 01:42:55.402
WORK THAT BEEN ABLE TO DO

01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:56.537
THROUGHOUT MANY DECADES IN

01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:58.772
PRISON. TO SHOW THAT I WAS NO

01:42:58.839 --> 01:43:00.874
LONGER THAT PERSON --

01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:02.276
IS SO I THINK IN TERMS OF

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:03.810
PREPARATION --

01:43:03.877 --> 01:43:05.812
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE

01:43:05.879 --> 01:43:07.514
TO PROVIDE A PROCESS WHERE.

01:43:07.581 --> 01:43:08.815
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S GONNA

01:43:08.882 --> 01:43:10.484
PROVIDE LEGAL COUNSEL DURING THE

01:43:10.551 --> 01:43:12.352
HEARING --

01:43:12.419 --> 01:43:14.087
AND ALLOW YOU TO FOCUS ON THE

01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:15.856
ACTUAL WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:17.024
DOING ON THE INSIDE LAWYER

01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:18.825
PRESENT.

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:21.061
SO WE LOOK AT THOSE THINGS AND

01:43:21.128 --> 01:43:21.929
THEN YOU LOOK AT THE HEARING

01:43:21.995 --> 01:43:22.930
ITSELF --

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:24.464
THE THAT THE HEARING COULD BE AT

01:43:24.531 --> 01:43:26.633
THE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AS THE

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:28.035
JOB INTERVIEW OF A LIFETIME.

01:43:28.101 --> 01:43:29.303
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:43:29.369 --> 01:43:31.471
INTERVIEW OF YOUR LIFE.

01:43:31.538 --> 01:43:33.307
AND YOU HAVE TO REALLY FOCUS ON

01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:35.042
ON WHO YOU ARE AT THAT MOMENT.

01:43:35.108 --> 01:43:36.476
AND SO YOU HAVE MADE ABOUT THREE

01:43:36.543 --> 01:43:38.946
TO FOUR HOURS. TO BE ABLE TO

01:43:39.012 --> 01:43:41.615
TELL YOUR STORY WHO YOU ARE AS A

01:43:41.682 --> 01:43:42.783
PERSON --

01:43:42.849 --> 01:43:44.551
INTO.

01:43:44.618 --> 01:43:45.452
REALLY.

01:43:45.519 --> 01:43:46.820
PUT THE RESPONSIBILITY ON

01:43:46.887 --> 01:43:49.122
INDIVIDUALS BOARD MEMBERS AND

01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:51.692
ATTORNEYS. TO BASE THAT OFF OF

01:43:51.758 --> 01:43:55.128
C. FALL WITHIN THREE HOURS OR

01:43:55.195 --> 01:43:55.762
WHATEVER TIME IS SPENT ON BEFORE

01:43:55.829 --> 01:43:59.032
THEY IS IT IS UNFAIR.

01:43:59.099 --> 01:44:00.000
I I THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE

01:44:00.067 --> 01:44:02.736
TIME ALLOCATED ON ALL OF THIS

01:44:02.803 --> 01:44:03.804
THE PARTIES.

01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:04.338
WHO ARE TRYING TO ASSESS

01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:06.640
INDIVIDUAL ANOTHER HUMAN BEING

01:44:06.707 --> 01:44:07.240
ON THE CHANGES THAT THEY HAVE

01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:08.408
MADE -- TO

01:44:08.475 --> 01:44:10.277
PREPARE TO GO HOME.

01:44:10.344 --> 01:44:11.545
AND SO I THINK THERE ARE A LOT

01:44:11.612 --> 01:44:12.746
OF VARIABLES THAT WE HAVE TO

01:44:12.813 --> 01:44:14.414
CONSIDER THAT MAKE THE PROCESS

01:44:14.481 --> 01:44:16.817
TO PREPARE. FOR A THREE HOUR

01:44:16.883 --> 01:44:17.517
HEARING.

01:44:17.584 --> 01:44:19.720
VERY VERY DIFFICULT.

01:44:19.786 --> 01:44:20.787
AND SO THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS

01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:22.122
THAT I THINK CAN BE DONE

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:23.790
DIFFERENTLY --

01:44:23.857 --> 01:44:26.126
ONE IS TO ALLOW ATTORNEYS OR

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:27.461
STATE APPOINTED ATTORNEYS TO BE

01:44:27.527 --> 01:44:28.929
ABLE TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:31.431
THEIR CLIENTS. TO GO OVER WHAT'S

01:44:31.498 --> 01:44:32.833
IN THERE SEE FILE WHAT'S MISSING

01:44:32.899 --> 01:44:34.201
IN THE CITY FATHERS SOMEBODY.

01:44:34.267 --> 01:44:35.168
A LOT OF TIMES THERE ARE SOME

01:44:35.235 --> 01:44:36.503
THINGS THAT DON'T GOING TO SEE

01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:39.473
FILE WHICH IS WHY IT'S NORMAL.

01:44:39.539 --> 01:44:40.807
TWO THERE'S A PRACTICE NOT AMONG

01:44:40.874 --> 01:44:42.709
THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO THE BOARD

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:43.977
TO CREATE THEIR OWN FILE THE

01:44:44.044 --> 01:44:45.579
FOLDER. TO PRESENTED TO THE

01:44:45.646 --> 01:44:46.613
BOARD.

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.649
BECAUSE NOBODY'S GOING TO ENSURE

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:50.917
THAT EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO GOOD

01:44:50.984 --> 01:44:52.152
WHILE YOU'RE IN PRISON.

01:44:52.219 --> 01:44:53.420
ISN'T A PACKET MORE THAN THE

01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:54.521
PERSON IS ACTUALLY DOING THOSE

01:44:54.588 --> 01:44:56.390
THINGS -- SO

01:44:56.456 --> 01:44:58.759
IN ORDER TO TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:44:58.825 --> 01:45:00.560
EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:02.496
WHILE IN PRISON IS NOTED.

01:45:02.562 --> 01:45:04.064
THEN MOST OF THE TIME

01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:04.398
INDIVIDUALS --

01:45:04.464 --> 01:45:05.198
CREATE THEIR OWN PACKAGE. TO

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:07.434
PRESENT --

01:45:07.501 --> 01:45:09.269
SO I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S A

01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:10.771
EASIER PROCESS TO REALLY.

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:13.540
MAKE THE HEARING MORE PERSONABLE

01:45:13.607 --> 01:45:15.242
SO THAT THEY CAN GET TO KNOW YOU.

01:45:15.308 --> 01:45:17.144
AS A PERSON MORE THAN.

01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:19.413
JUST YOUR C. FILE OKAY THANK YOU.

01:45:19.479 --> 01:45:20.547
THE QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS

01:45:20.614 --> 01:45:24.418
YES MY SYSTEM THANK YOU.

01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:27.521
SOMETHING I'M NOT QUITE TRACKING.

01:45:27.587 --> 01:45:28.722
BECAUSE LOOK AT SOME LEGISLATION

01:45:28.789 --> 01:45:30.424
THAT WE'VE DONE WE ARE

01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:32.793
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

01:45:32.859 --> 01:45:33.393
HEARINGS THE MISS WHAT YOU'RE

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:34.861
SAYING.

01:45:34.928 --> 01:45:35.896
TALK ABOUT NOT INCREASING THE

01:45:35.962 --> 01:45:37.798
NUMBER OF HEARINGS THAT WOULD BE

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:39.566
BE BETTER TO HAVE FEWER HERE.

01:45:39.633 --> 01:45:40.233
AND I'M --

01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:42.302
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF

01:45:42.369 --> 01:45:44.004
THAT SINCE WE WE'VE BEEN.

01:45:44.071 --> 01:45:45.539
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING SHOULD BE

01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:47.607
GIVING MORE ACCESS TO HEARINGS

01:45:47.674 --> 01:45:49.209
AND AND GIVE MORE PEOPLE THE

01:45:49.276 --> 01:45:51.545
ABILITY? TO TO HAVE THAT HEARING

01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:53.413
IN ORDER TO GO TO HAVE THE

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.115
OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT SO I

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:55.682
WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THAT A

01:45:55.749 --> 01:45:56.817
LITTLE BIT BETTER PEOPLE SHOULD

01:45:56.883 --> 01:45:58.418
ABSOLUTELY BE HAVING.

01:45:58.485 --> 01:46:00.754
AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:01.888
CASES HEARD YEAH.

01:46:01.955 --> 01:46:04.491
BUT IF ULTIMATELY MOST ARE

01:46:04.558 --> 01:46:07.461
DENIED PAROLE WHICH THEY ARE.

01:46:07.527 --> 01:46:09.062
THEN YOU HAVEN'T REALLY IMPROVE

01:46:09.129 --> 01:46:11.631
THE PROCESS YOU'VE SPENT IT UP.

01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:13.500
BUT IF THE RESULTS ARE ABOUT THE

01:46:13.567 --> 01:46:16.503
SAME WHICH THE THEY HAVE THEY

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:18.138
IT'S TRUE THEY HAVE DRAMATICALLY

01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:19.339
IMPROVED.

01:46:19.406 --> 01:46:22.976
IF 1% 220% IS DRAMATIC AND I

01:46:23.043 --> 01:46:24.511
THINK I THINK IT IS.

01:46:24.578 --> 01:46:26.046
BUT IT'S NOT NORMALLY GRANTING

01:46:26.113 --> 01:46:28.482
PAROLE AND SO I'M MORE I'M

01:46:28.548 --> 01:46:30.016
INTERESTED IN NOT JUST.

01:46:30.083 --> 01:46:33.153
THIS ACCOMMODATING MORE PEOPLE.

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:35.922
IT IS A COMMON WAY SO THAT THEY

01:46:35.989 --> 01:46:37.991
DON'T HAVE TO DO FIVE OR EIGHT

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:39.993
OR TEN PAROLE HEARINGS BEFORE

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.161
THEY ACTUALLY GET RELEASED.

01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:42.562
OKAY SIDE SO I THINK I

01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:43.997
UNDERSTAND ECONOMIC BETTER AYE.

01:46:44.064 --> 01:46:45.232
I AM ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN.

01:46:45.298 --> 01:46:48.235
IN GETTING MORE BUT I ALSO

01:46:48.301 --> 01:46:50.704
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT THE

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:53.740
THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS RATE IN.

01:46:53.807 --> 01:46:55.876
AND HAVING THAT BE THE BEST

01:46:55.942 --> 01:46:58.111
OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE

01:46:58.178 --> 01:46:59.246
DONE THE WORK AND TO MAKE A CASE

01:46:59.312 --> 01:47:01.848
WHICH AND SOME OF THE THINGS

01:47:01.915 --> 01:47:04.618
THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON

01:47:04.684 --> 01:47:05.452
BUILDING.

01:47:05.519 --> 01:47:07.554
AROUND THE REHABILITATION ONE OF

01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:11.124
THE VAST.

01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:12.492
I TRACTORS TO DOING THE

01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:14.161
PROGRAMMING THAT WE WANT TO DO

01:47:14.227 --> 01:47:15.595
AND WE ARE WORKING AS WE TALK

01:47:15.662 --> 01:47:17.297
ABOUT LAST UP ON THE PROGRAMMING

01:47:17.364 --> 01:47:18.865
ITSELF IN ENSURING THAT THAT.

01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:20.433
IS FUNCTIONAL THAT IT IS WORKING

01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:22.435
THAT DAY IS GOING TO LEAD TO THE

01:47:22.502 --> 01:47:23.503
OUTCOMES WE WOULD EXPECT.

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:25.138
BUT ONE OF THE BEST INCENTIVES

01:47:25.205 --> 01:47:27.641
IS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO GET

01:47:27.707 --> 01:47:30.143
PAROLE AND TO GET TO HEARING IT

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:31.812
AND TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT IT IS

01:47:31.878 --> 01:47:33.580
AS I'VE BEEN INSIDE A TALKING

01:47:33.647 --> 01:47:34.481
INTO THE JEWELS.

01:47:34.548 --> 01:47:35.949
THEY'RE MUCH MORE EXCITED ABOUT

01:47:36.016 --> 01:47:37.217
DOING SOME THE PROGRAMMING

01:47:37.284 --> 01:47:38.518
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THERE'S SOME

01:47:38.585 --> 01:47:40.620
HOPE OUT THERE AND THAT'S WHAT

01:47:40.687 --> 01:47:41.454
WE'RE ULTIMATELY TRYING TO LOOK

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:44.691
AT SO YES THE THE OUTCOMES AND

01:47:44.758 --> 01:47:46.693
AND THEN TO YOUR COMMENT ABOUT.

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:47.761
THAT.

01:47:47.828 --> 01:47:48.895
WE TEND IT GOVERNOR WE TEND THE

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:50.463
STOVE PIPE THINGS AND THIS IS

01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:51.965
WHAT IT BEGINS TO FEEL LIKE THAT

01:47:52.032 --> 01:47:53.967
IT WE'RE LOOKING AT PROGRAMMING

01:47:54.034 --> 01:47:54.935
INSIDE.

01:47:55.001 --> 01:47:56.436
SO THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN WORK ON

01:47:56.503 --> 01:47:57.904
THE TRAUMA THE ISSUES THAT THEY

01:47:57.971 --> 01:47:59.739
HAVE HAD TO TO ADDRESS THE

01:47:59.806 --> 01:48:00.774
ISSUES THAT THEY'VE HAD AND

01:48:00.841 --> 01:48:02.008
THAT'S SORT OF THROW IT OVER TO

01:48:02.075 --> 01:48:03.210
A PAROLE HEARING.

01:48:03.276 --> 01:48:06.413
WHEN IF WE DECIDE TO A BETTER?

01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:07.614
CAN TAKE YOU SYSTEM THAT THAT

01:48:07.681 --> 01:48:09.749
ARTICULATED BETWEEN THE TWO WE

01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:11.117
WHAT I WOULD HOPE TO BE ABLE TO

01:48:11.184 --> 01:48:11.785
HAVE [inaudible]

01:48:11.852 --> 01:48:13.987
THAT.

01:48:14.054 --> 01:48:16.656
PROGRAMMING THAT LEADS TO THE

01:48:16.723 --> 01:48:18.325
THE REHABILITATION THAT HAVE A

01:48:18.391 --> 01:48:20.026
LOT OF THAT WORK BUILD INTO

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:22.195
BUILDING YOUR OWN FILE BUILDING

01:48:22.262 --> 01:48:23.864
TO BUILDING YOUR OWN.

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:26.933
ABILITY AS A PRISONER TO MAKE

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.134
THAT CASE AND SO.

01:48:28.201 --> 01:48:30.604
ONE STEP TRANSLATES SOURCE

01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:33.306
SEAMLESSLY INTO THE OTHER AND

01:48:33.373 --> 01:48:34.975
THAT WOULD LEND FOR MORE TIME.

01:48:35.041 --> 01:48:35.842
ALSO THE COME ABOUT THE

01:48:35.909 --> 01:48:37.377
TOURNEY'S VERY WELL TAKE AND

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:38.478
THEN WE DEAL WITH ATTORNEYS

01:48:38.545 --> 01:48:39.980
WEATHER'S DEPENDENCY COUNCIL.

01:48:40.046 --> 01:48:41.715
LEGAL SERVICE SAYS AND IF THE

01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:43.016
OTHERS THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

01:48:43.083 --> 01:48:43.783
HARDEST PRESSED.

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:47.520
MOST STRAPPED ATTORNEYS WITHOUT

01:48:47.587 --> 01:48:49.089
IF THEIR CLIENTS THAT THEY NEED

01:48:49.155 --> 01:48:50.323
TO SPEND.

01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:51.558
BUT IF WE CAN SOMEHOW TO A

01:48:51.625 --> 01:48:53.526
BETTER JOB I THINK OF LINKING.

01:48:53.593 --> 01:48:54.761
THE PROGRAMMING THAT THAT WE

01:48:54.828 --> 01:48:56.930
KNOW.

01:48:56.997 --> 01:48:59.099
WE WANT AND LOOKING FOR

01:48:59.165 --> 01:48:59.966
ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THAT

01:49:00.033 --> 01:49:01.968
PROGRAM THE THAT PROGRAM AND

01:49:02.035 --> 01:49:03.203
GETTING SOME RESULTS.

01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:05.639
THE DECIDED BETTER TO TO FEED

01:49:05.705 --> 01:49:07.574
INTO WHICH IS WHICH SHOULD BE

01:49:07.641 --> 01:49:10.143
INTO THE PAROLE PROCESS SO THAT

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:12.312
THEY BUILT A BODY OF WORK.

01:49:12.379 --> 01:49:12.812
AROUND THEMSELVES IT ON

01:49:12.879 --> 01:49:14.915
THEMSELVES THEY THAT ARE BETTER

01:49:14.981 --> 01:49:17.617
PREPARED TO GET TO THAT HEARING.

01:49:17.684 --> 01:49:19.486
JUST LIKE STUDYING FOR THE BAR

01:49:19.552 --> 01:49:20.253
GOING THROUGH THE HOUSE WILL

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.222
RIGHT PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THAT

01:49:22.289 --> 01:49:22.956
ULTIMATE [inaudible]

01:49:23.023 --> 01:49:24.691
TEST.

01:49:24.758 --> 01:49:28.061
AND LOOK AT SUCCESS RATES THERE.

01:49:28.128 --> 01:49:29.062
AND AND UNDERSTAND THAT

01:49:29.129 --> 01:49:30.797
PROGRESSION THAT ARTICULATION I

01:49:30.864 --> 01:49:32.332
THINK WE WOULD ULTIMATELY BE

01:49:32.399 --> 01:49:32.933
BETTER OFF AND I THINK WE CAN

01:49:32.999 --> 01:49:33.900
SOLVE.

01:49:33.967 --> 01:49:35.302
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE

01:49:35.368 --> 01:49:36.369
BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

01:49:36.436 --> 01:49:38.171
HOW WE ADDRESS WHAT WE PAY FOR

01:49:38.238 --> 01:49:39.072
THOSE ATTORNEY BECAUSE I WOULD

01:49:39.139 --> 01:49:41.074
ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT SOMETHING

01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:42.442
WE NEED TO LOOK AT?

01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:43.743
WE HAVE TO ADEQUATELY PAY

01:49:43.810 --> 01:49:45.011
ATTORNEYS THAT THEY'RE NOT JUST

01:49:45.078 --> 01:49:46.546
SPENDING ITS WORKLOAD.

01:49:46.613 --> 01:49:47.747
AND IT'S APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS OF

01:49:47.814 --> 01:49:51.851
OF COMPENSATION. FOR THEM TO BE

01:49:51.918 --> 01:49:53.620
ABLE TO MAKE A CAREER AND AND

01:49:53.687 --> 01:49:54.821
BUILD IT AND STAY WITH IT

01:49:54.888 --> 01:49:56.556
WITHOUT HAVING TO DO EVERYTHING

01:49:56.623 --> 01:49:58.725
PRO BONO WITHOUT HAVING.

01:49:58.792 --> 01:50:00.694
TO GO OUT AND TRY AND FIND SUB

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:01.962
SUPPLEMENTAL --

01:50:02.028 --> 01:50:03.797
MONIES BECAUSE OF FOR PROVIDING

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:05.198
A STATE'S ATTORNEY THAN.

01:50:05.265 --> 01:50:07.100
THEN THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:07.701
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIND

01:50:07.767 --> 01:50:09.436
ADEQUATELY THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:10.770
DIFFICULT AND I KNOW WE'RE WE

01:50:10.837 --> 01:50:12.372
ARE DEALING WITH SOME BUDGET

01:50:12.439 --> 01:50:13.440
CONSTRAINTS AROUND THERE.

01:50:13.506 --> 01:50:14.507
I THINK WE LINK TITLE THIS

01:50:14.574 --> 01:50:16.476
TOGETHER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE

01:50:16.543 --> 01:50:19.346
GETTING MORE PEOPLE TO HEARINGS

01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:20.814
THAT ARE THEN SUCCESSFUL.

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.749
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT

01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:24.718
PROVIDING THAT INCENTIVE TO DO

01:50:24.784 --> 01:50:26.686
THE WORK TO DO THE PROGRAMMING

01:50:26.753 --> 01:50:28.254
INSIDE WHICH WE ALSO HAVE.

01:50:28.321 --> 01:50:29.589
TO PROVIDE AND WE ARE WORKING ON

01:50:29.656 --> 01:50:31.358
THAT AS WELL THEN I THINK WE

01:50:31.424 --> 01:50:33.026
HAVE A MUCH MORE SIT SENSIBLE

01:50:33.093 --> 01:50:35.428
SYSTEM THAT HAS SOME CONTINUITY.

01:50:35.495 --> 01:50:40.166
TO IT AND SOME RATIONAL'S ABOUT

01:50:40.233 --> 01:50:42.869
THAT I I WOULD I WOULD ADD --

01:50:42.936 --> 01:50:44.704
I'VE NOTICED THAT.

01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:45.839
ESPECIALLY SINCE MID SHAPERS

01:50:45.905 --> 01:50:47.073
COME ON BOARD.

01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:48.842
THAT -- THE

01:50:48.908 --> 01:50:50.944
BOARD HAS BECOME LESS OF A

01:50:51.011 --> 01:50:52.979
MYSTERY TO PEOPLE.

01:50:53.046 --> 01:50:55.148
AND BUT WE ALL APPRECIATE THAT

01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:56.716
AND AND PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE

01:50:56.783 --> 01:50:58.051
THEY ACTUALLY SEE THERE'S A

01:50:58.118 --> 01:50:59.252
PATHWAY.

01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:00.920
THAT IF THEY CAN DO THIS WORK

01:51:00.987 --> 01:51:02.389
THEN THEY CAN SHOW UP TO THE

01:51:02.455 --> 01:51:03.523
BOARD IN A WAY THAT WILL MAKE A

01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:05.025
DIFFERENCE HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE

01:51:05.091 --> 01:51:05.959
OUTCOME OF THE HEARING WHICH

01:51:06.026 --> 01:51:07.327
WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE NOW THE

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:08.395
MISSING PIECES.

01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:10.063
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:51:10.130 --> 01:51:11.598
PROGRAM MATIC OPPORTUNITIES ARE

01:51:11.664 --> 01:51:13.233
THERE SO THEY CAN DO THE WORK?

01:51:13.299 --> 01:51:14.934
YES AND SO AND SO THAT'S THE

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:15.502
PART THAT WE NEED TO DO AND

01:51:15.568 --> 01:51:16.770
THAT'S WHY ALSO THIS STRUCTURE

01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:18.171
DECISION MAKING.

01:51:18.238 --> 01:51:18.972
BECAUSE IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

01:51:19.039 --> 01:51:20.940
MORE ADDITIONAL HEARINGS WITH

01:51:21.007 --> 01:51:22.242
THE HOPE OF BUILDING IN THAT

01:51:22.308 --> 01:51:23.777
SUCCESS SO THAT WE'RE NOT AND I

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:25.245
I THINK I I GET YOUR COMMENT NOW

01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:26.079
ABOUT THAT.

01:51:26.146 --> 01:51:27.180
THE HEARINGS IS IT'S THE

01:51:27.247 --> 01:51:29.215
MULTIPLE HEARINGS AROUND AN

01:51:29.282 --> 01:51:30.417
INDIVIDUAL WE WANT.

01:51:30.483 --> 01:51:32.852
TO IDEALLY HAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:51:32.919 --> 01:51:35.522
EVERYONE INSIDE TO PUT THEIR

01:51:35.588 --> 01:51:35.955
BEST FOOT FORWARD.

01:51:36.022 --> 01:51:37.123
AND BE ABLE TO MOVE THOSE

01:51:37.190 --> 01:51:39.192
NUMBERS SO WERE ESSENTIALLY

01:51:39.259 --> 01:51:42.262
GRANTING PAROLE WELL DESERVED.

01:51:42.328 --> 01:51:43.229
FOR MORE OF THE INMATES ARE

01:51:43.296 --> 01:51:43.830
GOING THROUGH.

01:51:43.897 --> 01:51:46.733
THAT HELPS WITH OVERCROWDING IF

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:48.435
WE DO IT RIGHT IT HELPS WITH

01:51:48.501 --> 01:51:50.203
RECIDIVISM

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:51.404
IT IT TO SORT OF TAX A LOT OF

01:51:51.471 --> 01:51:53.139
THE BLOCKS.

01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:55.275
AND THE DISTRICT DECISION MAKING.

01:51:55.341 --> 01:51:57.210
LOOKS LIKE THAT MAY LEAD INTO

01:51:57.277 --> 01:51:58.745
THAT BUT I THINK I DON'T

01:51:58.812 --> 01:52:00.880
UNDERSTAND ENOUGH OF WHAT THAT

01:52:00.947 --> 01:52:02.749
MEANS AROUND AROUND THIS.

01:52:02.816 --> 01:52:06.486
AND HOW THAT CAN WORK WITH.

01:52:06.553 --> 01:52:08.021
HELPING TO GET PEOPLE TO THOSE

01:52:08.088 --> 01:52:09.089
HEARINGS.

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:10.256
REALLY GIVING THEM AN

01:52:10.323 --> 01:52:13.226
OPPORTUNITY TO ARTICULATE WHO

01:52:13.293 --> 01:52:14.627
THEY ARE WHAT CHANGES A BED

01:52:14.694 --> 01:52:15.962
THROUGH ALL OF THAT WORK THAT

01:52:16.029 --> 01:52:17.697
THEY'VE DONE INSIDE SO THAT THEY

HAVE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY OF

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:22.302
SUCCESS.

01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:25.371
THANK YOU WE HAVE QUESTIONS TO

02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:30.429
THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO RING

02:04:30.496 --> 02:04:31.664

SECOND LANGUAGE PROGRAMS BUT HOW

02:04:39.972 --> 02:04:41.273
DOES THAT WORK.

02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:43.609
IN GETTING HIM OUT AND KEEPING

02:04:43.676 --> 02:04:45.277
THEM FROM RETURNING BACK IN.

02:04:45.344 --> 02:04:46.345
INTO INTO THE SYSTEM --

02:04:46.412 --> 02:04:49.481

HAVE SYSTEMS YOU HAVE EVIDENCE

02:04:52.918 --> 02:04:55.154
BASED SYSTEMS TO SHOW THAT NOT

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:57.790
ONLY DOES IT WORK BUT YOU GIVE

02:04:57.857 --> 02:04:59.425
ME DOLLAR NUMBERS OF WHY.

02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:00.960
WE CANNOT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

02:05:01.026 --> 02:05:02.228
DO THIS AND IT AT THE RETURN ON

02:05:02.294 --> 02:05:04.230
INVESTMENT IS HUGE SO WE CAN

02:05:04.296 --> 02:05:06.031
INVEST MORE AND SO THAT WHEN WE

02:05:06.098 --> 02:05:06.665

OFFENDERS THAT HAD ACHIEVED A

02:05:45.137 --> 02:05:46.972
LEVEL OF LITERACY AS WE DEFINE

02:05:47.039 --> 02:05:47.473
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR

02:05:47.539 --> 02:05:48.374
EQUIVALENCY.

POINT 3% SO THAT'S ALMOST A 50%

02:05:56.815 --> 02:05:58.817
REDUCTION NOW I SAY THAT WITH

02:05:58.884 --> 02:05:59.685
CAUTION BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO A

02:05:59.752 --> 02:06:01.020
LOT MORE.

02:06:01.086 --> 02:06:02.354

MAKE SURE THAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS

02:06:04.723 --> 02:06:06.225
OF THE SAME ALL THE LEVELS OF

02:06:06.292 --> 02:06:07.192
COMPATIBLES OF THE SAME THE

02:06:07.259 --> 02:06:08.360
PROGRAMMING THOSE TYPES OF

02:06:08.427 --> 02:06:09.595
THINGS REPRESENT ITSELF BUT

02:06:09.662 --> 02:06:11.163
OVERSEEING INITIALLY IS REALLY

02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:12.965
HIGH LEVELS OF SUCCESS BY.

02:06:13.032 --> 02:06:14.433
FOCUSING ON LITERACY AS WE

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:15.701
DEFINE AND CONTINUING THE

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:17.469
EDUCATION SO WE'RE HOPING IN

02:06:17.536 --> 02:06:18.604
THIS UPCOMING PLAN THAT WE

02:06:18.671 --> 02:06:19.672
PRESENTED --

02:06:19.738 --> 02:06:21.140
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO REALLY KIND OF

02:06:21.206 --> 02:06:22.875
CLEAN THOSE DOLLAR FIGURES ON

02:06:22.942 --> 02:06:25.077
THE COST BENEFIT OF HAVING

02:06:25.144 --> 02:06:27.846
CONTINUED EDUCATION.

02:06:27.913 --> 02:06:28.480
AND I HOPE YOU'RE ABLE TO BLINK

02:06:28.547 --> 02:06:29.815
DO THAT BECAUSE WHEN THE PRIVATE

02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:30.950
PRISON PHí

02:06:31.016 --> 02:06:32.985
THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY NEEDED

02:06:33.052 --> 02:06:33.619
TEN THOUSAND MORE PRISON BEDS

02:06:33.686 --> 02:06:35.220
AND WHEN I ASKED HIM HOW COULD

02:06:35.287 --> 02:06:35.955
YOU.

02:06:36.021 --> 02:06:37.356
FIGURE THAT NUMBER OUT THEY SAID

02:06:37.423 --> 02:06:38.190
BUT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY

02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:39.325
CAN'T READ AT THEIR GRADE LEVEL

02:06:39.391 --> 02:06:41.327
THEY WOULD NEED. TEN THOUSAND

02:06:41.393 --> 02:06:42.061
MORE BEDS OVER THE NEXT TEN

02:06:42.127 --> 02:06:45.864
YEARS SO THIS PROGRAM.

02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:49.401
IS REALLY REALLY AN IMPORTANT --

02:06:49.468 --> 02:06:50.235
IN DEBT WE HAVE TO GET A RIDE

02:06:50.302 --> 02:06:50.536
[inaudible]

02:06:50.602 --> 02:06:53.872
OKAY -- WANT

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:54.707
TO THANK YOU ALL OF THE THE

02:06:54.773 --> 02:06:55.407
PROBE.

02:06:55.474 --> 02:06:56.575
AT THE END AND I THINK WE'LL

02:06:56.642 --> 02:06:57.409
LOOK AT IT IS WITHIN THAT ONE TO

02:06:57.476 --> 02:06:58.610
A PILOT OR WHETHER WE WANT TO

02:06:58.677 --> 02:07:00.479
JUMP INTO THE PROGRAM.

02:07:00.546 --> 02:07:01.680
MOST --

02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:03.415
MENTOR PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF

02:07:03.482 --> 02:07:04.750
LITERACY ARE RELATIVELY

02:07:04.817 --> 02:07:06.318
SUCCESSFUL I MEAN THAT'S WHAT

02:07:06.385 --> 02:07:08.220
THE RE PROGRAMS IN THE LIBRARY

02:07:08.287 --> 02:07:09.054
IS ALL ABOUT.

02:07:09.121 --> 02:07:10.622
PEOPLE BASICALLY MENTORING AND

02:07:10.689 --> 02:07:12.524
WANT TO TRAIN OTHERS TO LEARN TO

02:07:12.591 --> 02:07:13.125
READ.

02:07:13.192 --> 02:07:15.027
AND WE KNOW THAT LITERACY IS

02:07:15.094 --> 02:07:18.297
VERY FOR ISN'T --

02:07:18.364 --> 02:07:19.698
SO WITH IT CHANGES ALL THE

02:07:19.765 --> 02:07:21.433
COGNITIVE STUFF REMAINS TO BE

02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:22.668
SEEN BUT SURELY HAVING THE

02:07:22.735 --> 02:07:23.969
ABILITY TO READ.

02:07:24.036 --> 02:07:25.871
AS WELL AS THE FINISHED --

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:28.507
A HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY --

02:07:28.574 --> 02:07:30.976
IS IS ONE OF THE BEST IF TO

02:07:31.043 --> 02:07:32.778
START TALK MY GETTING A JOB.

02:07:32.845 --> 02:07:33.879
WHEN YOU LEAVE PRISON IN MY

02:07:33.946 --> 02:07:35.180
NORMAL IF YOUR EMPLOYER?

02:07:35.247 --> 02:07:35.781
AND YOU HAVE OTHER KINDS OF

02:07:35.848 --> 02:07:37.282
THINGS IN THAT THAT BECOMES A

02:07:37.349 --> 02:07:38.617
DIFFERENT OPTION DIFFERENT ROLE

02:07:38.684 --> 02:07:40.586
FOR YOU IN THAT SENSE SO WE'LL

02:07:40.652 --> 02:07:41.854
LOOK AT WHAT NOT TO DO A PILOT --

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:43.422
NOT I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA THE

02:07:43.489 --> 02:07:45.057
MENTORSHIP PROGRAM I KNOW YOU'VE

02:07:45.124 --> 02:07:46.959
MENTIONED HERE PAYING THE FOLKS

02:07:47.026 --> 02:07:47.526
TO DO IT AND GIVING THEM AN

02:07:47.593 --> 02:07:48.761
INCENTIVE --

02:07:48.827 --> 02:07:51.030
TO WANT TO WORK WITH THEIR PEERS

02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:52.531
AND TO ASSIST AT ONCE THEY

02:07:52.598 --> 02:07:55.067
TRAINED ON HOW TO IMPROVE --

02:07:55.134 --> 02:07:57.002
THE LITERACY OF OF THEIR FRIENDS

02:07:57.069 --> 02:07:58.137
AND THEIR COLLEAGUES AT THAT ARE

02:07:58.203 --> 02:07:59.872
THERE IN PRISON WITH THEM SO I

02:07:59.938 --> 02:08:01.340
THINK I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

02:08:01.407 --> 02:08:02.708
I'VE SEEN IT WORK IN SCHOOLS AS

02:08:02.775 --> 02:08:04.043
WELL AS IN LIBRARIES AND

02:08:04.109 --> 02:08:05.677
EVERYWHERE ELSE WHEN YOU GET A

02:08:05.744 --> 02:08:06.211
MENTOR AND YOU GET A WELL

02:08:06.278 --> 02:08:06.979
TRAINED PERSON.

02:08:07.046 --> 02:08:09.014
REALLY MENTORS A PERSON TO LEARN

02:08:09.081 --> 02:08:10.582
TO READ A WITH THE FOCUS UPON

02:08:10.649 --> 02:08:13.052
BASICALLY DEVELOPING THAT SKILL.

02:08:13.118 --> 02:08:14.653
OF THE TO READ AND THEN

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:15.921
OBVIOUSLY ALL THAT OTHER STUFF

02:08:15.988 --> 02:08:16.989
SHOULD KICK IN IF WE ALSO

02:08:17.056 --> 02:08:18.390
INVOLVING THEM IN SOME KIND OF

02:08:18.457 --> 02:08:20.492
OTHER TRAINING PROGRAMS.

02:08:20.559 --> 02:08:24.997
OF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL --

02:08:25.064 --> 02:08:26.632
THEN THE RECIDIVISM [inaudible]

02:08:26.698 --> 02:08:33.872
OKAY FOR ATTENDING THE HEARING.

02:08:33.939 --> 02:08:50.322
THE MEETING IS ADJOURNED
