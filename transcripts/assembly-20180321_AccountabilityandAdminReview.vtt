AND JUST A POINT PERSONAL

00:38:36.714 --> 00:38:40.118 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE YEAH THIS EIGHTEEN

00:38:38.483 --> 00:38:41.252 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO

00:38:40.118 --> 00:38:42.921 region:rollup2
THAT I WAS A STAFF PERSON AND

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:44.389 region:rollup2
SOMEONE SALINAS IS OFFICE.

00:38:42.921 --> 00:38:46.558 region:rollup2
WHEN WE FIRST RAN A CALIFORNIA

00:38:44.389 --> 00:38:47.659 region:rollup2
GROOM BILL AND AND SO IT WAS

00:38:46.558 --> 00:38:49.761 region:rollup2
VERY GRATIFYING TO SEE IT

00:38:47.659 --> 00:38:52.564 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER. I FINALLY

00:38:49.761 --> 00:38:53.731 region:rollup2
GET A SIGNED INTO LAW AND ONE OF

00:38:52.564 --> 00:38:55.366 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT TO THINK ABOUT

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:56.935 region:rollup2
IS YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE THE

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:58.303 region:rollup2

FOR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. AND

00:39:00.038 --> 00:39:03.741 region:rollup2
I THINK ONE THING THAT GETS LOST

00:39:01.206 --> 00:39:05.243 region:rollup2
IN THAT IS THAT WHEN A FARMER OR

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:06.711 region:rollup2
A PROCESSING PLANT HAS TO FILE

00:39:05.243 --> 00:39:09.614 region:rollup2

AT SACRAMENTO. THAT'S MONEY

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:16.254 region:rollup2
THAT'S TAKEN OUT OF THAT CAN

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:16.888 region:rollup2
UNIT IS ECONOMY.

00:39:16.254 --> 00:39:18.223 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT THAT'S TO MY THIS TAKEN

00:39:16.888 --> 00:39:19.057 region:rollup2
OUT OF FRESNO OR A ROW SEE OR

00:39:18.223 --> 00:39:20.091 region:rollup2
LINDSAY OR I'M IN THE INLAND

00:39:19.057 --> 00:39:21.960 region:rollup2
EMPIRE THE IMPERIAL VALLEY AND

00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:23.661 region:rollup2
GOES UP TO SACRAMENTO AND THERE

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.230 region:rollup2
MAY BE. I'M NO GOOD REASON FOR

00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:26.631 region:rollup2
THAT BUT THAT'S MONEY THAT DOES

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:28.132 region:rollup2
NOT GO BACK INTO INVESTMENT THAT

00:39:26.631 --> 00:39:30.568 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT GO BACK INTO WAGES

00:39:28.132 --> 00:39:31.402 region:rollup2
ETCETERA AND SO THAT CALIFORNIA

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:33.037 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IN THE

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:34.005 region:rollup2

00:40:01.933 --> 00:40:05.436 region:rollup2
MARGINS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE

00:40:03.568 --> 00:40:06.571 region:rollup2
