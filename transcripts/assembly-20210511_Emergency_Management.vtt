00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.170
OR THAT GROUP THIS MOVEMENT OF

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:33.838
THAT MOVEMENT. WHEN ALL THEY'RE

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:34.972
REALLY DOING IS EXERCISING

00:34:35.039 --> 00:34:37.241
THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS-

00:34:37.308 --> 00:34:38.276
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SECOND

00:34:38.342 --> 00:34:39.844
AMENDMENT RIGHTS IT'S SOMETHING

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.312
THAT COMES UP QUITE OFTEN WITH

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:43.147
DOMESTIC EXTREMISTS. ON THE

00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:45.383
OUTSIDES ARE WHERE THEY WERE

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:46.884
THEY'RE FEELING INFRINGED UPON

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:48.453
THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

SOME- BELIEVE OR POSSIBILITY OF

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:57.728
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY TAKE PLACE.

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:58.463
TO OPEN UP LOWER LEVEL

00:34:58.529 --> 00:35:00.064
INVESTIGATIONS AND THEN THERE

00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:03.801
IS A MYRIAD OF- LEVELS OF

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:04.902
AUTHORITY WHICH HAVE TO BE MET

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:06.504
TO MOVE FORWARD. TO GIVE LAW

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:08.339
ENFORCEMENT- THOSE ABILITIES TO

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:09.707
FOLLOW FOLLOW A LOT OF THESE

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.943
INVESTIGATIONS- AND I'M HERE TO

00:35:12.009 --> 00:35:13.945
TELL YOU THAT WHEN. IT COMES TO

00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:15.913
WHO FIRST MEMBER RIGHTS AND

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.381
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:19.851
RELATED TO- INVESTIGATIONS THE

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:21.786
FIRST AMENDMENT- WILL ALWAYS

00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:24.789
WENT OUT AND- SOMETIMES- THAT

00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:25.923
GETS A LITTLE DICEY WHEN

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.292
SOMETHING TAKES PLACE. AND

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:29.594
PEOPLE SAY HEY- THE FBI OR LAW

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.295
ENFORCEMENT KNEW ABOUT THIS

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:32.864
PERSON- WELL THEY MIGHT HAVE

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.131
KNOWN BUT WHAT THEY KNEW WAS

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:35.500
ONLY FIRST REMEMBER PROTECTED

00:35:35.566 --> 00:35:36.834
ACTIVITY THAT THEY COULDN'T

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:39.303
REALLY- GO FURTHER ON THERE WAS

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:40.705
THERE WAS NO THERE THERE AND

00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:41.973
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. ARE

00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:44.342
GOING FORWARD- DOMESTIC

00:35:44.408 --> 00:35:47.979
EXTREMISM IN THE FBI IS BROKEN

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:49.480
DOWN INTO THESE CATEGORIES IN

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:54.952
THIS THIS CHANGED. IN IN TWO

00:35:55.019 --> 00:35:55.553
THOUSAND NINETEEN. A IT REALLY

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.320
WAS A GOOD SHOW. ARE GOING FOR.

00:35:56.387 --> 00:35:57.388
STRAIGHT UP WHITE SUPREMACY

00:35:57.455 --> 00:35:59.290
EXTREMISM- BLACK SEPARATISM

00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:01.492
EXTREMISM TO THESE RACIALLY

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:03.461
MOTIVATED VIOLENT EXTREMISM

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:04.762
YOU'LL SEE THE WORD VIOLENT

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:05.830
INCLUDING EACH ONE OF THESE

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:08.699
CATEGORIES. AND THAT IS WHY-

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:10.768
THE FBI HAS THE ABILITY TO LOOK

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:13.504
AT INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS IS

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:14.739
BECAUSE OF THE VIOLENCE.

00:36:14.805 --> 00:36:16.107
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE

00:36:16.173 --> 00:36:17.808
IDEOLOGIES ARE NOT LOOKING AT

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:19.243
MOVEMENTS THEY'RE LOOKING AT

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.779
VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE-

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.848
ENTITIES. TO FURTHER THEIR

00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:26.050
COSTS SO RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT'S

00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:27.618
SET UP RACIALLY MOTIVATED

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.520
VIOLENCE REMAINS ANTI

00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:30.721
GOVERNMENT ANTI AUTHORITY

00:36:30.788 --> 00:36:32.523
MOTIVATED BY EXTREMIST. THAT

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.392
CAN ACTUALLY MIX WITH DIFFERENT

00:36:34.458 --> 00:36:36.327
PLAYERS- WHICH IS REALLY THE

00:36:36.394 --> 00:36:37.461
RIGHT WAITED TO LOOK AT THIS

00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:39.430
AND WHEN WE WHEN WE GET INTO

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:40.865
THE DIFFERENT- IDEOLOGIES

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:42.166
YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE HOW SOME OF

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:46.304
THEM WILL CROSS- CROSS SECTIONS

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:48.005
HERE. THIS CLEAR IS NOT

00:36:48.072 --> 00:36:49.440
TERRORISM AND I THINK THIS IS

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:51.709
WHAT THE PREVIOUS LIFE REALLY

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:53.778
EXPLAIN- WE HAVE A DEFINITION

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:57.048
OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM- BUT THE

00:36:57.114 --> 00:36:58.149
FIRST AMENDMENT IS RULE ONE IT

00:36:58.215 --> 00:36:59.584
WASN'T NAMED THE FIRST AMENDED

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.253
BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT-

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.754
THE PHOTOGRAPH ON THE LEFT A

00:37:03.821 --> 00:37:06.157
BLACK LIVES MATTER RALLY-

00:37:06.223 --> 00:37:07.925
PEOPLE. YOU KNOW YELLING AND

00:37:07.992 --> 00:37:09.660
SCREAMING ON THE RIGHT A STOP

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:12.730
THE STEEL- EVENT AND THAT IS

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:14.432
PEOPLE YELLING AND SCREAMING.

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:16.200
THE FIRST AMENDMENT GIVES US

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:18.169
THE RIGHT TO PEACEABLE ASSEMBLY

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:20.371
THAT DOES NOT MEAN QUIET

00:37:20.438 --> 00:37:22.006
ASSEMBLY. BOTH OF THESE

00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:23.307
PHOTOGRAPHS SHOW PEOPLE

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:24.442
EXERCISING THEIR FIRST

00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:25.309
AMENDMENT RIGHTS THERE IS

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:27.244
NOTHING ILLEGAL HERE AND THERE

00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:29.080
IS NOTHING TO COLLECT HERE FOR

00:37:29.146 --> 00:37:31.582
LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS IS WHERE

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:34.485
THE FIRST AMENDMENT WINS. WE'LL

00:37:34.552 --> 00:37:35.620
GET INTO NOW THE PATRIOT

00:37:35.686 --> 00:37:38.089
MILITIA MOVEMENT- IN THE

NINETEEN NINETIES HOW WE BUILD

MOVEMENT REALLY BEGAN TO GROW-

00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:58.609
AND IT DID SO BECAUSE IN THE

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:00.411
EIGHTIES THERE WAS A- DOWNTURN

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:01.779
IN THE ECONOMY IF WE REMEMBER

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:03.748

00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:27.798
WHITE SUPREMACIST ANTI SEMITIC

00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:38.442
CHARISMATIC SPEAKER HAD A

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:39.910
FOLLOWING OF THOUSANDS OF

00:39:39.977 --> 00:39:42.947
PEOPLE- BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE

00:39:43.013 --> 00:39:44.582
TO SPEAK. WHAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:45.783
IS THE PLATFORMS THAT WE'RE

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.418
LOOKING AT TODAY THE KU KLUX

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:49.220
KLAN HAS BEEN AROUND THROUGH

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:50.387
OUR HISTORY SINCE THE CIVIL

00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:52.923
WAR- IT HAS GONE IN EBBS AND

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.326
FLOWS. IN THE SIXTIES AND HAD-

00:39:55.392 --> 00:39:56.727
QUITE A FOLLOWING AND THEN IN

00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:58.662
THE SEVENTIES THE FBI- THROUGH

00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:00.331
UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS REALLY

00:40:00.397 --> 00:40:02.500
DECIMATED THE VERY VERY COMPLEX

00:40:02.566 --> 00:40:04.301
CLAN- THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT

00:40:04.368 --> 00:40:05.436
IT'S GONE THERE ARE OTHER

00:40:05.503 --> 00:40:06.971
GROUPS WERE OPERATING IN THE-

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:08.372
NINETIES AND TWO THOUSANDS.

00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:09.507
SOME OF THEM ARE STILL HERE

00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:11.175
TODAY BUT WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:11.976
THE GROUP THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:14.745
ABOUT TODAY WITHIN A FEW YEARS-

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:16.147
I PREDICT THAT THOSE GROUPS

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:18.115
WILL NO LONGER BE IN EXISTENCE

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:19.316
BUT THEY'LL BE IN ANOTHER FORM

00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:20.751
A DIFFERENT NAME THESE GROUPS

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:22.653
GENERALLY CHANGE THEIR NAME-

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:27.992
BUT THE IDEOLOGY. STAY THE SAME

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:28.592
GOING FORWARD. THE NATURAL I

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:30.294
INTO. AND HELD A LOT GROUP-

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:33.364

EVENTS AT THE U. S. CAPITOL ARE

00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:37.268
NOTHING NEW- AND IN TWO

00:40:37.334 --> 00:40:38.502
THOUSAND AND TWO ABOUT FOUR

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:39.603
HUNDRED BILLION NOT THE SHOWED

UP AT THE U. S. CAPITOL. THEY

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:44.208
HAD A PERMIT THEY MARCHED. IN

00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:45.776
WHERE YOU SEE IN THE PHOTOGRAPH

00:40:45.843 --> 00:40:47.645

THOSE TWO ENTITIES APART. AND

00:40:57.254 --> 00:40:59.156
THAT IS WHERE YOU HAVE A

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:00.124
PEACEFUL FIRST AMENDMENT

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:02.393

THEY BREAK OFF AND RUN INTO

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.535
EACH OTHER FIND EACH OTHER.

00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:13.671
THAT THE VIOLENCE TAKES PLACE-

00:41:13.737 --> 00:41:15.172
WHERE YOU HAVE NEO ****

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:25.082
COUNTER THE NEO **** MOVEMENT.

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:26.784
UP THE ANARCHIST MOVEMENT HAS

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:28.919
BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS AND- AS

BY A THOUSAND OF THEM IT ADDS

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:44.154
UP TO A LOT OF MONEY SO THERE'S

00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:45.522
SOMEWHERE THERE IS FUNDING

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:47.457
COMING TO THIS. POTENTIALLY

00:48:47.524 --> 00:48:50.394
FROM OVERSEAS ADVERSARIES. OR

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:55.732
THROUGH SALES OF MEMORABILIA.

STATES AND PUTTING GASOLINE ON

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:06.143
THAT FIRE. I COULD CHANGE THIS

00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:07.411
LIGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY BECAUSE

00:49:07.477 --> 00:49:09.313
EACH ONE OF THESE. DIFFERENT

00:49:09.379 --> 00:49:10.547
PLATFORMS HAS EITHER DEEP

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:13.450
PLATFORM BUT- LOCATIONS OR-

00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:24.461
YOU SEE. THE PLATFORMING TAKING

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:26.129
PLACE YOU'LL SEE THE PLATFORM

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:28.398
BEING SET UP UNDER A DIFFERENT-

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:31.401
ENTITIES- TWO THOUSAND

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:32.302

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:34.338
HEATHER HIGHER WITH KILLED.

00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:37.107
WHEN A CAR WAS DRIVEN INTO A

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:39.843
CROWD- THIS WAS CLEARLY

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:40.877
SOMETHING THAT FIT THE

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:41.878
DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:44.114
TERRORISM- THE DRIVER WAS

00:49:44.181 --> 00:49:46.616

CHARGED WITH WITH- HATE CRIMES

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:50.854
BUT HE WAS NEVER CHARGED WITH

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:52.356
DOMESTIC TERRORISM BECAUSE AS I

00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:53.790
SAID THERE IS NO PENALTY

00:49:53.857 --> 00:49:55.125
ATTACHED TO THE DEFINITION OF

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:56.426
DOMESTIC TERRORISM. I THINK

00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:57.260
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE

00:49:57.327 --> 00:49:59.096
SHOULD BE ONE FEDERALLY.

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:00.897

00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:19.182
DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:21.551

IMPLIES ARE PRIMARILY BASED

00:57:04.554 --> 00:57:07.123
OVERSEAS. THEN I WILL BE REALLY

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:10.126
FOCUSED QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY ON.

00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:11.561
THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SCREAMS A

00:57:11.628 --> 00:57:14.063
LANDSCAPE- AUGMENTING- SOME OF

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:16.166
THE THINGS THAT TOM HELPLESSLY-

00:57:16.232 --> 00:57:18.334
STARTED US OFF WITH TODAY AND

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:19.569
THEN AT THE END OF MY

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:22.505
PRESENTATION I'M I'LL GO INTO

00:57:22.572 --> 00:57:24.707
SOME CONCLUDING THOUGHTS AND

00:57:24.774 --> 00:57:28.444
RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR US TO

00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:32.415
CONSIDER. SO IN THE- TWENTY

00:57:32.482 --> 00:57:34.017
TWENTY TIME PERIOD IN JANUARY-

00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:35.451
THE NATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:37.353
CENTER- PRODUCED A REALLY GOOD

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.556
PRODUCT REGARDING DEATH THREATS

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:41.724
SPECIFICALLY POSED TO. LAW

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:44.360
ENFORCEMENT FIREFIGHTERS. EMTS

00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:46.396
AND PARAMEDICS AND IN THAT

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:48.531
REPORT THEY TALK ABOUT THE

00:57:48.598 --> 00:57:50.633
POSSIBILITY OF AMBUSH ATTACKS

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.869
THAT COULD THREATEN THE LIVES

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:54.671
OF THESE TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS

00:57:54.737 --> 00:57:55.872
WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES

00:57:55.939 --> 00:57:58.441
TRYING TO PROTECT PEOPLE. AND

00:57:58.508 --> 00:57:59.576
TO SPECIFIC KINDS OF ATTACKS

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:00.810
AMBUSH ATTACKS SPECIFICALLY

00:58:00.877 --> 00:58:02.946
WERE HIGHLIGHTED AS A THREAT TO

00:58:03.012 --> 00:58:04.681
FIRST RESPONDERS ONE WAS THE

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:06.416
LORING AMBUSH ATTACK WHICH IS A

00:58:06.482 --> 00:58:08.351
PREMEDITATED ATTACK. IN WHICH

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:09.452
THE OFFENDER LAWRENSON

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:11.287
UNSUSPECTING TARGET TO A

00:58:11.354 --> 00:58:13.223
LOCATION TO EXECUTE ATTACK. AND

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:14.624
THEN THERE IS THE OPPORTUNISTIC

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:16.192
AMBUSH ATTACK WHICH IS AN

00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:17.594
UNPROVOKED ATTACK WITHOUT

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:19.629
REALLY ANY LONG TERM PLANNING

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:21.764
THAT THE OFFENDER CONSIDERS. A

00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:23.366
CRIME OF OPPORTUNITY AND MAKE

00:58:23.433 --> 00:58:25.101
THAT DECISION IF THERE AT THAT

00:58:25.168 --> 00:58:27.237
SPOT TO CARRY OUT THE SURPRISE

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:29.939
ATTACK AGAINST THE TARGET-

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:31.808
THESE KINDS OF ATTACKS. ARE

00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:33.209
PROBLEMATIC TO SAY THE LEAST

00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:34.577
BUT ALSO THERE ARE THE

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:36.246
POSSIBILITIES OF SECONDARY

00:58:36.312 --> 00:58:38.014
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES THAT COULD

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:39.782
TARGET FIRST RESPONDERS AND

00:58:39.849 --> 00:58:41.751
ONLOOKERS AFTER THE INITIAL

00:58:41.818 --> 00:58:43.653
TACK. TEARS MAY ACTUALLY TRY TO

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.188
CARRY OUT A SPECIFIC ATTACK AND

00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:46.422
THEN AGAIN A SECOND ATTACK

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.124
AGAINST THE FIRST RESPONDERS

00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:50.360
WHO ARE RESPONDING TO THAT

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:52.228
FIRST ATTACK IN THAT ATTACK.

00:58:52.295 --> 00:58:53.696
COULD NOT BE IN THE SECONDARY

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:55.899
ATTACKS COULD INCLUDE. ANY

00:58:55.965 --> 00:58:58.701
NUMBER OF- ACTIVITIES EXPLOSIVE

00:58:58.768 --> 00:59:00.970
DEVICES ON COULD BE HIDDEN IN

00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:02.338
BACKPACKS GARBAGE CANS

00:59:02.405 --> 00:59:05.008
MAILBOXES AND IN THIS IS A

00:59:05.074 --> 00:59:09.545
THREAT TO FIRST. RESPONDERS YOU

00:59:09.612 --> 00:59:11.814
ALSO. GOOD HAVE NOT TERRORISTS-

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:12.849
IN PERSON EIGHT ESSENTIALLY

00:59:12.916 --> 00:59:14.517
RESP THEN PERHAPS BEST EXAMPLE

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:16.352
I CAN RECALL OF THIS WITHIN THE

00:59:16.419 --> 00:59:17.987
LAST TEN YEARS WAS IN NORWAY

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:20.690
WHERE- A WHITE SUPREMACIST BY

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:22.158
NAME THE ANDERS BREIVIK CARRIED

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:24.360
OUT A TERRIBLE. ATTACK IN

00:59:24.427 --> 00:59:26.195
NORWAY THAT RESULTED IN MANY

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:28.731
DEATHS SIXTY EIGHT OF WHICH-

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:29.732
HAPPENED ON THIS ISLAND IN A

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:31.234
TOYOTA WHERE BREIVIK WAS

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:33.503
DRESSED AS A POLICE OFFICER AND

00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:35.605
WENT AND HUNTED THE CHILDREN ON

00:59:35.672 --> 00:59:37.440
THAT ISLAND. ONE BY ONE

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:41.711
IMPERSONATING ESSENTIALLY THE-

00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:43.713
I'M BEING ASKED TO STEP WHY DID

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:44.614
MY SCREEN A LITTLE BIT

00:59:44.681 --> 00:59:45.682
HOPEFULLY THAT YOU CAN SEE IT A

00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:48.117
LITTLE BIT BETTER THERE- THE

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:50.053
IT'S IMPERSONATING. A POLICE

00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:52.188
OFFICER IS ANOTHER MECHANISM WE

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:54.590
NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT IN THE

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:56.392
CONTEXT OF. AMBUSH RELATED

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:58.695
ATTACKS AND THEN FINALLY-

00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:01.731
SHOULD BE AWARE AS WELL OF-

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:05.301
ATTACKS IN WHICH- AMBULANCES OR

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:08.771
OTHER KINDS OF- PERSONNEL

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.606
REPORT ENTITY TO AN EQUITY

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:13.843
ORIENTED- WHERE THE ACTUAL

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.445
ACTIVITIES THE FIRST RESPONDERS

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:17.280
CAN BE CO OPTED IN HOUSTON.

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:18.281
THERE REALLY TWO EXAMPLES OF

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:21.217
THIS I CAN THINK OF ONE IN TWO

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:21.851
THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHERE THE

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:23.119
TERRORIST GROUP ISIS

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:24.954
ESSENTIALLY USED AMBULANCES FOR

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:28.024
AN ATTACK. AND THEN A TWO

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:29.292
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHEN THE

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.828
AFGHAN TALIBAN- CARRIED OUT A

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:34.163
MAJOR ATTACK USING AMBULANCES

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:35.331
THAT KILLED MORE THAN ONE

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:36.632
HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS SO THESE

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:37.600
ARE SOME OF THE VARIOUS WAYS IN

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:39.836
WHICH- I REALLY WORRY ABOUT

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:41.838
HOW- FIRST RESPONDER EQUIPMENT

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.139
CAN BE USED OR HOW FIRST

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:48.878
RESPONDERS. CAN BE TARGETED

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:49.712
SPECIFICALLY. AND IT'S HAPPEN

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:51.114
CAL RIGHT IN OUR STATE HERE AS

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.749
WELL I'M BILL OF YOU THAT CAN.

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:55.752
FROM FEBRUARY DESTINY. WHERE

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:57.987
EMTS AND FIRST RESPONDERS- A

01:00:58.054 --> 01:00:59.856
FIREFIGHTER IN THE CAN DOWN AND

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:01.824
A PARAMEDIC WERE TARGETED IN

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:03.826
ANTIOCH CALIFORNIA BY A DRIVE

01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:05.428
BY SHOOTING DAYS THEY WERE THEY

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:06.829
WERE AMBUSHED AND I THINK THAT

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:09.198
IS A REAL EXAMPLE- IN OUR

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:10.600
BACKYARD OF THESE KINDS OF

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:12.201
TACTICS USING BEING USED IN

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:13.669
THIS CASE. BY INDIVIDUALS MAY

01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:15.438
NOT NECESSARILY BEEN PART OF A

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.339
FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:19.642
BUT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ENGAGED

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:21.844
IN CRIMINALITY. BUT WE ALSO

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:23.579
CAN'T FORGET ABOUT THE THREAT

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:27.116
POSED BY GROUPS BASED OVERSEAS-

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:28.684
AND HOW THEY CAN STILL INSPIRE

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:30.553
INDIVIDUALS TO DO REAL WORLD

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.556
HARM. IN THIS SENSE- THE STATE

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:35.258
OF NEW JERSEY ISSUED REALLY

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:37.326
IMPORTANT GUIDANCE IN APRIL

01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:37.894
TWENTY TWENTY ONE JUST LAST

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.396
MONTH. ABOUT HOW INDIVIDUALS

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:42.098
WHO MAY BE INSPIRED BY GROUPS

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:43.633
LIKE AL QAEDA IN THE ISLAMIC

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:47.070
STATE- ARE STILL MOTIVATING

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:49.472
INDIVIDUALS TO CARRY OUT-

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.240
AMBUSH LIKE STYLE ATTACKS IN

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:53.509
HERE YOU HAVE A- SPECIFIC

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:54.444
EXAMPLE I HAVE ON THIS POWER

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.979
POINT SCREEN. OF AN INDIVIDUAL

01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:58.181
BY THE END OF THE SEASON SOME

01:01:58.247 --> 01:02:00.483
OF WHICH- WHO ATTACK THREE NEW

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.018
YORK CITY POLICE OFFICERS WITH

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.320
A KNIFE EVEN USING ESSENTIALLY

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.522
THE CAMOUFLAGE OF BML PROTEST

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:08.424
TO CARRY OUT THE ATTACK. AND AS

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.659
TIME WENT ON WE LEARNED THAT

01:02:09.725 --> 01:02:11.894
SOME ADDITION CELL WAS INSPIRED

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:16.165
BY SALAFI JIHADIST PROPAGANDA.

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:17.834
IN IN THE OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONS

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.802
OF ORGANIZATIONS LIKE AL QAEDA

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:22.238
IN THE ISLAMIC STATE YOU STILL

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:24.507
SEE- GROUPS LIKE AL QAEDA

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:26.409
CALLING OUT FOR LONE WOLF OR

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:27.743
LOAN OFFENDER ATTACKS AGAINST

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:29.045
LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:30.313
SPECIFICALLY USE THAT

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:32.615
CAMOUFLAGE OF PROTEST TO CARRY

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:34.417
OUT THOSE ATTACKS. IN HERE YOU

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:36.619
HAVE AN EXCERPT. FROM

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:37.987
PUBLICATION BY AL QAEDA THAT'S

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:40.022
CALLING ON. INDIVIDUALS TO

CARRY OUT A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:43.626
ATTACKS SO THE DEPARTURE FROM

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:45.194
THE KNIFE ATTACKS FROM THE

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:47.463
PREVIOUS SCREEN- IN POWER POINT

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:49.532
SLIDE BUT THE POINT HERE IS-

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.367
THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:52.368
BEHIND THESE FOREIGN BASED

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:55.304
GROUPS ARE A PERSISTENT THREAT.

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:57.273
TO AMERICANS TODAY I'M IN THE

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.142
CONTINUE TO INSPIRE INDIVIDUALS

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.610
THAN THE SUM OF ITS ATTACK WAS

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:02.712
JUST LAST YEAR SO WE CAN'T

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:04.881
DISCOUNT THAT. POSSIBILITY OF

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:07.550
THE FOREIGN BASED ON INFLUENCE

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.685
THREATS MOVING FORWARD- THE

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:11.787
SECOND THING I WOULD SAY IS- WE

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:13.489
ALSO NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF HOW

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:15.958
FOREIGN BASED GROUPS. CAN USE

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:18.361
TACTICS THAT CAN BE EMULATED BY

01:03:18.427 --> 01:03:20.329
DOMESTIC EXTREMISTS MANY OF

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:22.331
THOSE THAT TOM SPOKE ABOUT IN

PERSONALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IT'S

01:11:54.843 --> 01:11:56.478
THE ANTI GOVERNMENT GROUPS LIKE

UNDERSCORE A POINT TOM HAD MADE

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:25.541
BUT ALSO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:28.277
TO MENTION- THAT CAREER DID NOT

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:30.813

THIS UNDERSCORES AGAIN TOM'S

01:13:13.188 --> 01:13:15.290
POINT. THE NEED TO CONSIDER

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:19.495
USING- ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO-

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:21.764

TODAY- IT IF YOU GO BACK TO

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:30.105
SOME OF THOSE EARLIER MAPS IN

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:31.373
TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF TROOPS

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.274
THAT WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.676
ABOUT- IT IS A- SIGNIFICANT.

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:36.311
CHALLENGE BUT ONE

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:37.980
RECOMMENDATION THAT MAY BE

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:40.816
PRACTICAL IS ALSO CONSIDERING-

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:42.918
THE EXPANSION OF THE HERTZBERG-

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:44.853
OUR TIME CALIFORNIA PREVENTION

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.055
TERRORISM ACT- JUST AS TOM

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:48.857

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:50.292
UNITED STATES WE DON'T HAVE A

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:51.560
DOMESTIC TERRORISM STATUTE

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:53.595
FEDERALLY A LOT OF STATES DON'T

01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:55.430
HAVE SUFFICIENT LAWS TO TACKLE

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:57.199
THE THREAT DOMESTIC TERRORISM.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:01.069
CALIFORNIA'S BETTER THE MANY-

01:14:01.136 --> 01:14:01.804
BUT STILL CAN DO BETTER. REALLY

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:02.471
I WOULD BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:05.541
THIS SECOND BULLET POINTS HERE-

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.976
WHERE THE LAW AS IT EXISTS

01:14:08.043 --> 01:14:10.345
TODAY ONLY PROHIBITS THE USE OF

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:12.514
THE THREATS. OR USE OF WEAPONS

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:14.516
OF MASS DESTRUCTION- WHICH CAN

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.285
INCLUDE INCENDIARY DEVICES SO

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:18.120
IT IS PRETTY NARROW IT WOULDN'T

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:21.223
COVER- ACTS OF VIOLENCE RELATED

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.325
TO TERRORISM- THAT MAY FOR

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:25.327
INSTANCE USE SMALL ARMS AND I

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:27.396
SEE THAT AS A GAP THAT COULD BE

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:29.731
LEGISLATIVE REALLY REMEDY- THE

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:32.634
LAST THING I'LL SAY- IS. I DO

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:36.104
BELIEVE- EMERGENCY RESPONDERS

FIREFIGHTERS EMTS LOCAL LAW

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.943
ENFORCEMENT REMAIN AT HIGH RISK

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:43.278
OF AMBUSH ATTACKS THEY REALLY

01:14:43.345 --> 01:14:45.714
DO NEED ADDITIONAL TRAINING BY

01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:46.849
THE STATE AND LOCAL LAW

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:48.350
ENFORCEMENT SO THEY CAN BE

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:50.185
BETTER PREPARED IF THEY ARE PUT

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:53.088
FACE. AN AMBUSH ATTACK AND I

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.890
THINK ONE WAY TO DO THIS COULD

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:56.925
BE A MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS TO

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:58.694

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:25.340
SENSE- I THINK. MOST OF US

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:26.174
WOULD AGREE I THINK THAT

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:28.076
SILICON VALLEY- COMPANIES

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:30.445
WHETHER IT'S- FACEBOOK TWITTER.

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:32.314
GOOGLE YOUTUBE ALL OF THEM CAN

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:33.582
STILL DO MUCH BETTER IN THE

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:35.083
CONTEXT OF ENSURING THAT THEIR

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.819
PLATFORMS ARE ABUSED BY. BAD

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:38.820
ACTORS IN THERE HAVE BEEN

01:17:38.887 --> 01:17:41.123
REPORTS OVER TIME GOOD PRESS

01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:42.691
REPORTS ABOUT HOW IN FACT.

01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:44.192
ALGORITHMS HAVE BEEN USED TO

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:47.396
RECOMMEND- A NEW FACEBOOK PAGE

01:17:47.462 --> 01:17:50.899
TO FOLLOW A NEW- YOUTUBE VIDEO

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:52.801
TO WATCH I'M A NEW PERSON TO

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:55.303
FOLLOW OVER TWITTER. THAT COULD

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:57.339
LEAD ONE DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:59.775
OF RADICALIZATION SO. ONE THING

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.977
I THINK THAT COULD BE USEFUL-

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:04.679
IS TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE HOW

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:07.149
ALGORITHMS MAY BE USED BY

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:09.184
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:10.619
INFLAME INDIVIDUALS TO

01:18:10.685 --> 01:18:12.888
RADICALIZE INDIVIDUALS. AND THE

01:18:12.954 --> 01:18:14.856
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE

01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:15.557
ONE BILL THAT'S BEEN

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.659
INTRODUCED- TO TRY TO DO BETTER

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:20.028
IN TERMS OF THAT. CONCEPT OF

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:21.730
ALGORITHMIC RADICALIZATION THAT

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:23.432
IS A THREAT BUT I ALSO THINK

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:25.267
THE STATE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY AS

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:28.537
WELL. IN ENSURING THAT THESE-

01:18:28.603 --> 01:18:30.138
AT LARGE TECH COMPANIES DO DO

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:32.507
THEIR PART IN ENSURING THAT THE

01:18:32.574 --> 01:18:36.511
PLATFORMS. ARE BEING ABUSED BY

01:18:36.578 --> 01:18:38.547
A BAD ACTOR SO I DO THE ISSUE

01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:40.082
OF ALGAL. IS A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:44.686
WHAT. HI THANK YOU- ANY

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:46.621
COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY

01:18:46.688 --> 01:18:47.189
QUESTIONS FOR MOVE ON TO THE

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:50.459
NEXT FROM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:53.295
GALLERIA QUESTION. FROM YOU

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:57.065
HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO. DO

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:59.768
WE DO WE NEED TO MAKE SOME KIND

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:00.335
OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:04.873
MIGHT BE. FRINGE VIEWPOINTS IN

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:08.076
SOCIETY. AND DOMESTIC

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:12.047
TERRORISM- AND ALL AND ALL OF.

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:13.515
YEAH I MEAN THEY SEEM TO BE A

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.517
BIG FOCUS ON FOR EXAMPLE LIKE

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.886
Q. ANON RIGHT WHICH IS.

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:20.288
CERTAINLY A CONSPIRACY THEORY.

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:23.258
YOU KNOW- THE GOES AROUND TO

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:24.726
DIFFERENT GROUPS BUT ISN'T

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:26.428
NECESSARILY LINKED TO ANY KIND

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:28.130
OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM IN

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:31.066
ITSELF- AND JUST LIKE I MEAN

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:32.334
FOR INSTANCE I'LL DO ANOTHER

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.368
KNOWLEDGE I MEAN A LOT OF

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:34.536
PEOPLE OF ISLAMIC FAITH BUT WE

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.072
CERTAINLY DON'T. A TRIBUTE ALL

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:39.841
OF THEM TO THE FUNDAMENTALISTS

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:40.609
WHO MIGHT CARRY OUT TERRORIST

01:19:40.675 --> 01:19:42.077
ATTACKS LIKE IN SAND SAMPOERNA

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:44.613
DINO- MY NAME IF YOU WILL HAVE

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:46.114
VERY FUNDAMENTALIST RELIGIOUS

01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:49.017
VIEWS. BUT THAT DOESN'T

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:51.286
NECESSARILY LEAD TO ARE NOT

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:53.955
ENGAGING IN VIOLENCE- OR IN

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:58.026
CARRYING OUT ATTACKS- EVEN OUT

01:19:58.093 --> 01:20:01.363
THIS SUMMER- YOU KNOW A LOT OF.

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:04.599
PROTESTS REGARDING THE- MURDER

01:20:04.666 --> 01:20:07.836
OF GEORGE FLOYD- AND I THINK

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:09.204
WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SALAS A CO

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:10.839
OPTION OF SOME OF THE VERY

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:12.440
PEACEFUL PROTEST FOR THE MOST

01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:18.513
PART. BY MORE FRINGE GROUPS- I.

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:19.981
YOU KNOW THAT CARRIED OUT

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:21.950
ATTACKS BATTERIES TWO PEOPLE

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:23.718
WERE KILLED- DURING SOME OF

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:28.590
THOSE PROTESTS NATIONWIDE- IS

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.325
THERE A DISTINCTION THERE AND

01:20:30.392 --> 01:20:31.259
MAYBE TO THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:32.694
THIS SUMMER DO I DIDN'T HEAR

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:35.597
MUCH ON THIS POINT BUT- I

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:36.932
BELIEVE WAS MR O'CONNOR POINTED

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:38.967
OUT THERE'S THE UNDER THE

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:41.536
CAMOUFLAGE OF PROTEST. SOME OF

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:42.938
THESE GROUPS ARE KIND OF

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:44.272
INFILTRATING PROTESTS AND

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:47.776
CARRYING OUT- YOU KNOW

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:50.679
TERRORIST ATTACKS. DO WE FIND

01:20:50.745 --> 01:20:51.880
OUT THAT THERE WERE SOME GROUPS

01:20:51.947 --> 01:20:54.015
INVOLVED WITH SAY EXAMPLE THAT

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:56.918
THE PROTEST WE SAW THIS SUMMER

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:57.552
WHERE I THINK FROM A LOT OF THE

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:59.454
MEDIA REPORTS. VERY MUCH

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.323
PEACEFUL PROTEST OBVIOUSLY

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:04.359
PEOPLE FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY.

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:05.527
BUT WE'RE NOT CARRYING OUT ANY

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:06.628
KIND OF ATTACKS BUT THEN THERE

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:08.630
WERE OBVIOUSLY GROUPS IN THERE

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.266
THAT WERE IN FACT DOING THAT-

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:13.001
DID WE FIND OUT THAT THERE WERE

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:15.203
CERTAIN GROUPS RESPONSIBLE. OR

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.572
THEY WERE HELPING ORGANIZE THAT-

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:18.306
BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS KIND

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:20.642
OF A DISTINCTION AND WE TEND TO

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:21.409
KIND OF HIT THESE THINGS WITH A

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:24.613
BROAD BRUSH. AND THAT CAN BE.

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:26.014
PROBLEMATIC I THINK MEANS SO

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:29.584
MAYBE JUST SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE.

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:30.518
IF I IF I CAN JUMP BY

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.921
MEDITATION- I APPRECIATE THAT

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:35.190
QUESTION BECAUSE IT IS SPOT ON

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:36.992
RIGHT- IN THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:38.660
POWER POINT PRESENTATION I TALK

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.629
ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:41.630
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FIRST

01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:43.398
AMENDMENT HOW THE FIRST MOMENT

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:46.067
WINS OUT IN IN- ANY DISCUSSIONS

01:21:46.134 --> 01:21:47.535
WITH THE AND WHEN IT COMES TO

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:50.538
INVESTIGATIONS- SO IT IT IT IS

01:21:50.605 --> 01:21:53.308
NOT THE- ACTIVITY THAT THE

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:55.110
PROTEST AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:56.911
THAT DRAWS INVESTIGATION. INTO

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:59.681
THE VIOLENCE AND THAT IS- IF

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:00.949
THAT IS THE EXTREME VIOLENCE

01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:02.384
RIGHT SO WE'RE TALKING WHEN I

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:04.953
MENTIONED- UNDER THE COVER OF

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.688
THE PROTESTS THAT WAS IN

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:09.190
REGARDS TO THE BOOGALOO BOYS

01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:11.359
WHO KILLED A FEDERAL PROTECTIVE

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:13.161
OFFICER AT THE OAKLAND

01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:16.197
COURTHOUSE- JUST A SHORT

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:17.565
DISTANCE AWAY FROM A BLACK

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:19.501
LIVES MATTER RALLY. IN THEIR

01:22:19.567 --> 01:22:21.770
INTENT WAS TO BLAME THAT

01:22:21.836 --> 01:22:23.772
KILLING AND THE BLACK LIVES

01:22:23.838 --> 01:22:25.307
MATTER GROUP THAT WAS THERE

01:22:25.373 --> 01:22:27.242
THERE IT'S SOLE PURPOSE WITH IT

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:28.343
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THAT'S HOW

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:31.146
WITH A WHO WAS DONE BY- SO

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:32.614
UNDER THE COVER OF PROTESTS

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:36.885
THEY USED A- A MURDER- TO TRY

01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:38.920
AND- PUT IT BACK ON AND- THE

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:42.057
OTHER PEOPLE- SO IT TRULY IS

01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:43.792
THE VIOLENT ACTIONS AS YOU

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:45.960
SAID. Q. ANON HAS HAD- I MEAN

01:22:46.027 --> 01:22:46.895
IT'S A CONSPIRACY THEORY

01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:48.496
THERE'S THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:50.332
FOLLOW IT IF THE PEOPLE WHO

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:52.567
WILL SHOW UP IN WASHINGTON DC

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:54.569
AND FIRE OFF A RIFLE INSIDE A

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:55.804
COMET PIZZA BECAUSE THEY

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:57.839
BELIEVE THE CONSPIRACY THEORY

01:22:57.906 --> 01:22:59.007
THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN BEING

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:00.975
HELD IN THE BASEMENT THERE BY.

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:03.812
DEMOCRATS AND- YOU KNOW WOULD

01:23:03.878 --> 01:23:05.947
BE PARTICULARLY- HILLARY

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:08.516
CLINTON AND- PROTEST- IN THEIR

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:21.196
EMAILS THEY THAT THEY CO NO.

01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:21.763
QUIETLY SAID THAT THERE WERE

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:22.764
CHILDREN IN THE BAY PLACE THE-

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:24.366
THEORIES IN THE QUEUE DRAW WILL

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:28.269
THIS TO DRIVE FROM. UP TO ONE

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:31.473
THE FIRE OFF A GUN. OF THE- COM

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:33.875
PIZZA SO THERE HAVE- THE VINYL

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:40.648
IS WHY NEEDS TO BE. LOOKED THAT-

01:23:40.715 --> 01:23:42.283
IT'S NOT THE IDEA. IT NOT THE-

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:43.952
THEORY- THOSE ARE THINGS THAT

01:23:44.018 --> 01:23:45.787
CAN. TO A- BUT I STATED IT THE

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:47.055
VIOLENCE THE LAW ENFORCED NEED

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:49.124
TO LOOK AT- A IN YOUR CAN HAVE.

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:50.692
DIFFERENT YOU. HOLD CAN.

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:52.360
THEORIES AND THAT'S FINE IT'S

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:54.229
YOU USE THAT- STEP OUT INTO BY.

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.096
BETTER BECAUSE- A LAW ENFORCED

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:56.798
ISSUE YEAH THAT THAT WAS ALL OF

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:58.933
THE- I THINK YOU SAID THE

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.503
ACTUALLY AL-QAEDA'S IN. ISLAMIC

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:03.805
STATE HAVE SAID IN THEIR- IN A

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:06.708
LOT OF THEIR STUFF- ONLINE-

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:11.112
PROPAGANDA THAT THEY ARE USING.

01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:11.713
THE CAMOUFLAGE OF PROTEST. AS

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:12.714
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THESE

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:14.382
THINGS AND I WOULD ALSO SAY

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:16.017
ISN'T THIS A COMMON TACTIC ALSO

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:18.520
OF ANTIFA. TO USE THE

01:24:18.586 --> 01:24:21.990
CAMOUFLAGE OF PROTEST TO DO

01:24:22.056 --> 01:24:22.524
EXACTLY THE THINGS YOU'RE

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:26.428
TALKING ABOUT. SO PUBLISHER OF

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:27.328
THE JASON BECAUSE I DIDN'T

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:31.032
MENTION ALL KIND OF OR- OKAY

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:32.167
MAYBE THAT WE CHASE AND SARIA.

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:33.568
IT WAS ONE OF THE TWO BALD GUYS

01:24:33.635 --> 01:24:34.803
SO- THAT WAS THAT WAS

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:36.938
DEFINITELY ME- AND ACTUALLY IN

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:38.239
THE PUBLICATIONS THEY DO

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:41.543
ENCOURAGE- INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:44.012
BE SUPPORT OF THE AL QAEDA OR

01:24:44.078 --> 01:24:46.948
ISIS MESSAGE. TO LEVERAGE

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:49.517
PROTESTS AND IT LEVERAGING

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.486
PROTEST WHETHER IT'S LEFT WING

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:53.288
RIGHT WING OF RELIGIOUSLY

01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:54.422
MOTIVATED TERRORIST YOU'RE

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:56.491
ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE BAD ACTORS

01:24:56.558 --> 01:24:58.726
WHO MAY BE- SEEING THAT

01:24:58.793 --> 01:24:59.894
PROTESTS THAT COULD BE A

01:24:59.961 --> 01:25:02.931
LEGITIMATE PROTESTS- A WHEN TOM

01:25:02.997 --> 01:25:03.832
HAD THE SLIGHT ABOUT PEOPLE

01:25:03.898 --> 01:25:05.233
YELLING AND- AND RAISING YOUR

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.801
VOICES TO PROTEST THAT'S

01:25:06.868 --> 01:25:08.603
COMPLETELY. UNACCEPTABLE THIS

01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:10.205
IS THE UNITED STATES BUT THERE

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:11.873
ARE THOSE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:12.974
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER THE KIND

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:15.343
OF GROUP- IT DATE THANK YOU

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:18.179
WANT TO INFILTRATE AND TOM.

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:19.414
REFERENCED A LOCAL- THE

01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:21.182
BILLABLE A RELATED ATTACK IN

01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:23.117
AND THAT WAS A ONE AT THAT I

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:24.586
THINK CAN US ALL CLOSED AT THE

01:25:24.652 --> 01:25:25.220
HOME BECAUSE THAT WAS HERE IN

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:26.788
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ONE

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:28.656
OF. THE OTHER ONES I REMEMBER

01:25:28.723 --> 01:25:30.525
VERY VIVIDLY I AM NOT LONG

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:32.694
BEFORE THAT WAS IN IN VEGAS-

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:35.930
AND ANOTHER BML BLM PROTESTS-

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:37.465
IN WHICH A FEDERAL LAW

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:39.267
ENFORCEMENT INTERCEPTED TWO ARE

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:40.268
ACTUALLY THREE MEMBERS OF THE

01:25:40.335 --> 01:25:41.970
BLUE BOYS WHO ARE PLAYING- AND

01:25:42.036 --> 01:25:43.872
ATTACK THEIR ALSO TOOK TO USE

01:25:43.938 --> 01:25:47.242
MOLOTOV. COCKTAILS AND THEN WE

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:48.543
DOOFFER CALL IN THE PACIFIC

01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:50.545
NORTHWEST- SO THE WITH THE

01:25:50.612 --> 01:25:51.846
FIRST I THINK THAT'S A

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:54.282
TYPICALLY- IT SHOULD BE A BIT-

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:55.817
TRIBBLE GAP TO AN INDIVIDUAL

01:25:55.884 --> 01:25:58.152
WHO SELF IDENTIFY AS- ANTIFA

01:25:58.219 --> 01:25:59.854
CARRIED OUT- A SHOOTING AT A

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:03.258
PROTEST- KILLING A MEMBER. OF

01:26:03.324 --> 01:26:04.826
IN A ORGANIZATION I THINK WITH

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:06.427
COMPATRIOT FIRST OR SOMETHING

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:09.397
LIKE THAT SO- THAT WAS A- A

01:26:09.464 --> 01:26:11.766
LEFT WING- INCIDENTS THAT I CAN

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:13.535
RECALL AS WELL SO. I AM MY

01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:15.203
POINT IS IT DOESN'T MATTER- THE

01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:17.238
IDEOLOGY YOU'LL FIND BAD ACTORS

01:26:17.305 --> 01:26:18.706
WHO ARE GOING TO BE PRONE TO

01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:19.607
VIOLENCE TRYING TO LEVERAGE

01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:21.543
THESE PROTESTS. TO FURTHER

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:22.544
THEIR OWN AGENDA WHICH IS QUITE

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:27.615
OFTEN VERY. SEPARATE FROM THE

01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:28.249
ACTUAL PROTEST ITSELF. YOU CAN

NATIONAL THREAT- THAT WAS

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:39.327
THOUGHT TO BE ON THE STATE

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:49.237
TO THE STATE CAPITOL THAT

01:26:49.304 --> 01:26:51.339

THERE IS THERE ANY EXISTING

01:26:58.479 --> 01:26:59.714
THREAT AND WHAT WAS THE ACTUAL

01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:01.683
THREAT LEADING UP TO. THE DAY

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:03.718

ARE SORT OF BARRICADED UP FOR.

01:27:24.505 --> 01:27:26.774
HI I GUESS I CAN JUMP ON THE

01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:28.509
FIRST PART OF THAT- SO THE

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:31.212
INTELLIGENCE- THAT WAS-

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:33.414
GATHERED AND PUBLICLY- TALK

01:27:33.481 --> 01:27:36.651
ABOUT WAS- A KIND OF A GENERAL

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:39.220
TO- STATE CAPITALS NOT

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:40.488
SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA'S STATE

01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:42.690
CAPITAL BUT K. STATE CAPITALS

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:45.193
AND A FOLLOW ON. AS THE U. S.

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:47.862
CAPITOL HAVE BEEN LOCKED DOWN

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:50.632
THAT THE- THE CHATTER ONLINE

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:54.202
WAS TO GO TO THE STATE CAPITOL-

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:57.639
THIS LAST- SECURED- YOU KNOW

01:27:57.705 --> 01:27:59.841
THEN THE U. S. CAPITOL WAS AT

01:27:59.907 --> 01:28:02.543
THE TIME AND IS- SO THAT THAT

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:06.247
WAS THE THREAT- YEAH I RETIRED

01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:07.782
IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- FROM

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:09.417
THE F. B. I. SO I DON'T HAVE

01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:11.953
THE- THE DAILY BRIEFINGS ON

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.688
WHAT THE THREAT WAS- IT

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:15.623
CURRENTLY IS NOW AND I WOULDN'T

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:21.162
VENTURE TO WHAT. TO SAY. OR

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:23.564
WHAT IT WAS GONNA BE- AMERICA

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:25.800
TO MAKE SOME UP FOR YOU. OKAY

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:30.405
I'M- OKAY I THINK UN VICE CHAIR

01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:31.472
KELLY SAID A QUESTION I IF YOU

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:33.374
BOTH OF- YOU FOR YOUR UPDATE ON

01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:34.976
THAT. YEAH THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:36.377
GOING ON A LONG TIME THAT'S

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:38.046
BEEN GOING ON EVER SINCE I WAS

01:28:38.112 --> 01:28:40.715
THE FIRST INTO THE FIRE SERVICE

01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:41.582
THIRTY FIVE NOW FORTY YEARS

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:44.619
AGO. AND IT JUST SEEMS THAT ONE

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:46.621
GROUP DISAPPEARS IN ANOTHER

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:49.557
GROUP TAKES ITS PLACE AND I

01:28:49.624 --> 01:28:51.225
THINK THE MOST EFFECTIVE THING

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:51.926
THAT HAS BEEN DONE OVER THE

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:54.896
YEARS IS TO FOR THE MOST PART-

01:28:54.962 --> 01:28:56.831
KEEP THE GENIES IN THE BOTTLE

01:28:56.898 --> 01:29:00.568
AND NOT LET THEM OUT AND EAT

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:04.038
OUT NOW WE HAVE. MORE OF A

01:29:04.105 --> 01:29:06.908
PROLIFERATION OF YOU KNOW

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:09.610
BASICALLY PUTTING IT OUT THERE

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:13.381
AND MAKING IT. THIS THAT THESE

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:16.350
PEOPLE GET PUBLICITY. AND THAT

01:29:16.417 --> 01:29:18.119
PUBLICITY IS SOMETHING THAT

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.822
THEY FEED ON. AND YEAH YOU KNOW

01:29:20.888 --> 01:29:23.157
I THINK THE EFFORTS USED TO BE

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:25.727
HEY. YOU KNOW WE WORK QUIETLY

01:29:25.793 --> 01:29:26.461
BEHIND THE SCENES TO KEEP THEM

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:28.296
IN THE BOTTLE. AND NW

01:29:28.362 --> 01:29:30.965
EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE IT OUT

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:33.401
AND I THINK WITH WITH OUR

01:29:33.468 --> 01:29:35.670
SOCIAL MEDIA AND THINGS LIKE

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:36.804
THAT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:38.172
FROM A PUBLIC POLICY

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:40.374
PERSPECTIVE. IT YOU KNOW HOW DO

01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:41.876
WE HOW DO WE GO ABOUT DOING

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:43.511
THAT KEEP IN THAT. YOU KNOW

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:44.579
KEEP IT WOULD GET YOU'RE NOT

01:29:44.645 --> 01:29:47.115
GOING TO. YOU CAN'T FIX SOME OF

01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:50.451
THESE MINDS OF PEOPLE WHO HATE.

01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:53.654
BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY KEEP THEM-

01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:54.255
DISCOURAGED FROM ACTING OUT ON

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:57.125
IT. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK THE

01:29:57.191 --> 01:29:59.794
BIG THE BIG POLICY ISSUES ARE

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.829
IS HOW DO WE HOW DO WE- GOVERN

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:06.033
SO THAT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T.

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.869
AREN'T ENCOURAGED TO ACT OUT.

01:30:07.935 --> 01:30:09.270
BECAUSE WE SEEM TO BE HAVING A

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:12.640
LOT OF THAT. J. SURVIVING JUMP

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:14.675
AND JUST QUICKLY- AND THEN

01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:16.410
PASSED OFF TO YOU ON THIS ONE-

01:30:16.477 --> 01:30:18.045
THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:19.147
THAT ARE SET UP ACROSS THE

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:20.548
UNITED STATES FIFTY SIX FIELD

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:21.783
OFFICES ALL HAVE JOINT

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:23.551
TERRORISM TASK FORCES. THEY'RE

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:25.486
MADE UP OF STATE LOCAL AND

01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:27.488
EDERAL AGENCIES- THEY ARE

01:30:27.555 --> 01:30:29.891
WORKING DAY AND NIGHT- PUTTING

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:31.859
DOWN THREATS THAT ARE COMING IN

01:30:31.926 --> 01:30:33.828
AT A AT A RATE WHICH WOULD BE

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:35.997
ALARMING FOR ANYONE WHO WAS NOT

01:30:36.063 --> 01:30:38.900
IN THAT- IN THAT MISSION SETS

01:30:38.966 --> 01:30:41.969
SO- THEY ARE DOING BE QUIET

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:44.772
WORK BEHIND THE SCENES- TO. TO

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:46.040
TAKE DOWN THESE INDIVIDUAL

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:47.375
ACTORS GET IN FRONT OF THE

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:49.410
VIOLENCE AND YOU DON'T ALWAYS

01:30:49.477 --> 01:30:50.311
SEE ABOUT IT YOU DON'T ALWAYS

01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:52.847
HEAR ABOUT IT- I THINK IT'S

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:54.415
IMPORTANT WHEN WE DO HAVE AN

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:57.151
ACTUAL. EVENT THAT TAKES PLACE

01:30:57.218 --> 01:30:59.854
THAT- THAT THE PERSON'S THE

01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:01.455
PERSONS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:31:01.522 --> 01:31:03.024
THOSE CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES WHICH

01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:04.525
MEET THE DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC

01:31:04.592 --> 01:31:06.494
TERRORISM I THINK IT WOULD IT'S

01:31:06.561 --> 01:31:08.796
IMPORTANT FOR THE VICTIMS- THAT

01:31:08.863 --> 01:31:10.264
THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:11.599
CALLED DOMESTIC TERRORISTS BUT

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:12.900
THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAVE THE

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:13.935
ABILITY TO CHARGE THEM

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:15.236
FEDERALLY AS DOMESTIC

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:17.004
TERRORISTS- AND THAT WOULD BE

01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:19.607
ADDING IT A PENALTY TO THAT

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:21.709
PAIN- MUCH LIKE. THE HATE

01:31:21.776 --> 01:31:23.878
CRIMES- HATE CRIMES HAVE HAVE

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:26.314
THE ABILITY- IF AN EVENT TAKES

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:28.749
PLACE THAT FEELS THE DEFINITION

01:31:28.816 --> 01:31:29.617
OF A HATE CRIME IT ALSO

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:31.919
FULFILLS ASSAULTS AND HOMICIDES

01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:33.521
THESE TYPE OF THINGS BUT WE

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:35.456
CALL THEM HATE CRIMES WE CHARGE

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:36.791
THEM AND HATE CRIMES BECAUSE

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:38.726
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND ONE OF

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:39.894
THE THINGS THAT THAT'LL DO IS

01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:41.629
LET THE VICTIMS THE VICTIMS

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:43.197
FAMILIES KNOW THAT THE

01:31:43.264 --> 01:31:43.998
GOVERNMENT IS TAKING THAT

01:31:44.065 --> 01:31:46.200
SERIOUSLY- IT IS NOT JUST

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:48.202
VIOLENCE IS VIOLENCE FOR A

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:49.971
POLITICAL PURPOSE. IN IN THE

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:51.038
UNITED STATES THAT'S SOMETHING

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:53.140
WE REALLY CAN'T TOLERATE SO WE

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:55.276
HAVE AN EVENT THAT MEETS THAT

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:56.711
DEFINITION I THINK IT'S

01:31:56.777 --> 01:31:58.746
IMPORTANT THAT WE- HAVE THE

01:31:58.813 --> 01:31:59.981
ABILITY TO RAISE TWO THAT I

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:01.949
THINK- TO THE CHARGE THAT

01:32:02.016 --> 01:32:04.185
PERSON WITH THAT- SO WE CAN

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:06.387
TRACK IT BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT

01:32:06.454 --> 01:32:07.722
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. YOU

01:32:07.788 --> 01:32:13.728
CAN LOOK DOWN THE LIST. THAT I

01:32:13.794 --> 01:32:14.428
JUST GO ONLINE AND FIND THE NO

01:32:14.495 --> 01:32:15.363
BROKE INTERNET TERROR EVENTS

01:32:15.429 --> 01:32:16.697
HAVE TAKEN TONIGHT. IF YOU LOOK

01:32:16.764 --> 01:32:17.498
UP. TERRORISM YOUR NOT GOING

01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:20.001
TO. A AND- LIST AT ALL BECAUSE-

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:20.768
YOU HAVE TO LOOK UP EVERY

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:23.804
ASSAULT EVERY HOMICIDE NC BACK

01:32:23.871 --> 01:32:25.273
TO MY PRESENTATION IF THAT

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:27.008
NUMBER TWO WHAT IS THE PURPOSE

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:28.509
WHY DID THIS PERSON DO THIS TO

01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:30.011
INTIMIDATE OR COERCE A CIVILIAN

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:31.679
POPULATION. OR TO INFLUENCE THE

01:32:31.746 --> 01:32:33.781
POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT. SO I

01:32:33.848 --> 01:32:35.082
BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:37.585
MAKING MARTYRS OUT OF PEOPLE-

01:32:37.652 --> 01:32:38.920
FOUR FOUR CASES THAT THAT DON'T

01:32:38.986 --> 01:32:40.221
REALLY RISE TO THAT-

01:32:40.288 --> 01:32:42.556
DEFINITION. BUT WHEN IT DOES WE

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:43.824
NEED TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:46.260
THAT EVEN OF ITSELF CAN ALSO

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:48.329
NOT ONLY WILL IT HELP TRACK.

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:49.463
WOULD HELP THE VICTIMS AND

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:50.731
THEIR FAMILIES BUT IT WILL

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:53.801
ALSO. BE A DETERRENT- YOU YOU

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:55.202
MAY NOT SPEED DOWN THE HIGHWAY

01:32:55.269 --> 01:32:56.537
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:58.272
TO GET A TICKET FOR GOING OVER

01:32:58.339 --> 01:33:01.108
THAT SPEED LIMIT- PEOPLE MAY

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:02.743
NOT STEP OUT INTO THAT VIOLENCE

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:03.611
IF THEY KNOW THAT THE

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:04.612
GOVERNMENT IS TAKING IT

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:06.681
SERIOUSLY. LIKE WE DO MANY

01:33:06.747 --> 01:33:08.716
OTHER ARE CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS.

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:10.284
RIGHT SO WHAT I'M HEARING FROM

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:11.585

COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT AND-

01:38:20.394 --> 01:38:21.929

WE'RE SEEING THE RISE IN

01:40:24.651 --> 01:40:29.957
