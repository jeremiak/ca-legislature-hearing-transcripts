THIS WEEKEND WITH FIREWORKS.

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:24.099
THE RISK OF DOING SO UNTIL

ASSEMBLY MEMBER AL MURATSUCHI

02:20:07.098 --> 02:20:09.033
FOR ALL HIS SUPPORT AND FOR

02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:09.667
BEING A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR ON

02:20:09.734 --> 02:20:11.703
THE SCALE. I GREW UP IN L. A.

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:13.271
COUNTY MY WHOLE LIFE WITH THE

02:20:13.338 --> 02:20:14.639
FAMILY DEEPLY INVOLVED IN LOCAL

02:20:14.706 --> 02:20:16.374
POLITICS. AND YET I'M

02:20:16.441 --> 02:20:17.408
EMBARRASSED TO SAY THAT I

02:20:17.475 --> 02:20:18.977
DIDN'T HEAR THE HISTORY OF

02:20:19.043 --> 02:20:20.678
BREEZES BEACH UNTIL LAST YEAR.

02:20:20.745 --> 02:20:21.980
I'VE GROWN UP THINKING THAT THE

02:20:22.046 --> 02:20:23.214
JIM CROW SEGREGATIONIST

02:20:23.281 --> 02:20:24.716
POLICIES OF THE SOUTH DID NOT

02:20:24.783 --> 02:20:26.484
HAPPEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND

02:20:26.551 --> 02:20:27.619
THAT FOR THE MOST PART OF

02:20:27.685 --> 02:20:29.120
CALIFORNIANS WERE CLEAN OF SUCH

02:20:29.187 --> 02:20:31.122
A RACIST PAST. BUT THAT WASN'T

02:20:31.189 --> 02:20:33.458
TRUE. THE STORY BRIDGES BEACH

02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:34.626
IS THE STORY OF THE AMERICAN

02:20:34.692 --> 02:20:35.960
DREAM BEING STOLEN FROM

02:20:36.027 --> 02:20:38.329
HARDWORKING AFRICAN AMERICAN

02:20:38.396 --> 02:20:38.897
FAMILY JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR

02:20:38.963 --> 02:20:42.233
RACE. A LAWFUL DRIVING BUSINESS

02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:43.868
THAT PROVIDED AFRICAN AMERICANS

02:20:43.935 --> 02:20:44.969
ACCESS TO THE BEACH WAS

02:20:45.036 --> 02:20:46.738
INTENTIONALLY SHUT DOWN BY THE

02:20:46.805 --> 02:20:47.939
CITY GOVERNMENT WITH THE

02:20:48.006 --> 02:20:50.041
INTENTION OF DRIVING OUT BLACK

02:20:50.108 --> 02:20:51.876
FAMILIES AND BLACK BEACH GOERS.

02:20:51.943 --> 02:20:53.444
WHAT HAPPENED TO WILL AND

02:20:53.511 --> 02:20:54.479
CHARLES BRUCE ALMOST ONE

02:20:54.546 --> 02:20:55.880
HUNDRED YEARS AGO WAS A GREAT

02:20:55.947 --> 02:20:57.115
INJUSTICE THAT WAS NOT ONLY

02:20:57.182 --> 02:20:59.117
INFLICTED ON THEM BUT ALSO ON

02:20:59.184 --> 02:20:59.818
GENERATIONS OF THEIR

02:20:59.884 --> 02:21:01.386
DESCENDANTS ALMOST CERTAINLY

02:21:01.452 --> 02:21:02.987
WOULD HAVE BEEN MILLIONAIRES

02:21:03.054 --> 02:21:03.521
HAD THEY BEEN ABLE TO KEEP

02:21:03.588 --> 02:21:05.323
THEIR PROPERTY. I WHILE WE

02:21:05.390 --> 02:21:07.091
CANNOT CHANGE THE PAST WE

02:21:07.158 --> 02:21:07.892
SHOULD DO EVERYTHING IN OUR

02:21:07.959 --> 02:21:09.928
POWER IN THE PRESIDENT TO CRACK

02:21:09.994 --> 02:21:11.996
THIS HISTORIC INJUSTICE. WHEN I

02:21:12.063 --> 02:21:13.364
FOUND OUT THAT L. A. COUNTY

02:21:13.431 --> 02:21:14.732
CURRENTLY OWNS THE LAND THAT

02:21:14.799 --> 02:21:16.034
