WE JUST HAD A QUICK COMMENT ON

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:08.263
THIS -- SO WE DO THINK THAT THIS --

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:08.863
PROGRAM IS CERTAINLY PROMISING

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:09.664
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN TRIED

01:21:09.731 --> 01:21:11.967
BY THREE STATES BUT JUST JUST

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:13.101
FOR A FEW YEARS.

01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:14.135
ON THIS AND THEN IT WILL BE NEW

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:16.438

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:17.839
LIKE THE YOUTH CHALLENGE PROGRAM

THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT

BECAUSE THIS IS SO NEW THERE IS

01:21:20.775 --> 01:21:22.611
A PRETTY LIMITED INFORMATION ON

01:21:22.677 --> 01:21:23.578
THE EFFECTIVENESS.

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:24.112
I'M CERTAINLY IT'S VERY

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:26.147
PROMISING CERTAINLY WE EXPECT TO

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:27.983
HAVE -- WE WE VERY MUCH HOPE TO

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:29.584
HAVE THESE THESE OUTCOMES SO WE

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:31.419
DO THINK IT'S WORTH I'M HAVING

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:32.754
THE DEPARTMENT I'M PROVIDE A

01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:33.989
LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON

EFFECTIVENESS AND TRACK THE

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:38.827

01:21:38.893 --> 01:21:40.262
THE CHAIR GOT TO REALLY ONE OF

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:42.664

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:49.838
SUCCESSES AND AND ESPECIALLY

01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:50.739
THAT WE DON'T LOSE TRACK OF THE

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:52.807
STUDENTS -- AFTER THEY LEAVE THE

01:21:52.874 --> 01:21:59.648

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:04.185
REALLY OUR MAIN -- RIGHT OKAY.

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:04.786
DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:06.321

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:19.287
REQUESTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT IT

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:20.488

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:21.589
WE DO WE DON'T TAKE ISSUE WITH

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:23.458
CONTINUING TO FIND THESE ONE

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:25.359
TIME COSTS -- WE WOULD NOTE TO

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:26.461
THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE THINK

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:27.829
ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS THAT'S

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:29.764
BEFORE YOU IS -- WHAT FUNDING

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:31.866

BUT ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO AS

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:35.069
THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONS ON THERE

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:36.337
ARE GONNA BE SIGNIFICANT ONGOING

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:37.705
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:39.207
MAINTAINING AN OPERATING THAT

01:29:39.273 --> 01:29:40.308

01:29:43.911 --> 01:29:45.813
DIFFERENT OPTIONS ON THAT THEY

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.582
ARE THAT THEY THINK ARE THE MOST

01:29:47.648 --> 01:29:49.484
PROMISING AYE THOSE INCLUDE FOR

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:51.953

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:04.065
WORTHWHILE THAT THEY'VE PROVIDED --

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:05.600

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:07.335
HOWEVER THAT -- SOME MORE

01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:09.036
DETAILS WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE

01:30:09.103 --> 01:30:11.339
LEGISLATURE IS IT WEIGHS ON LONG

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:12.607

FOR EXAMPLE IT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:16.244
WHAT THE MECHANISMS WILL BE TO

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:19.213
ATTACK US AS THOSE CHARGES IF --

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.281

THOSE WILL BE A COULD WILL

01:30:28.322 --> 01:30:29.590
ULTIMATELY BE IMPLEMENTED OR

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:31.292
MAYBE ONLY A SUBSET OF THOSE

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:32.760

THIS YEAR COULD COULD BE PRETTY

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:40.935
IMPORTANT -- BECAUSE IT MIGHT

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:42.570

KNOW THIS IS ANOTHER PROPOSAL

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:09.317
THAT LACKS -- ABOUT TO CHANGE

01:33:09.383 --> 01:33:11.085
PROPOSAL -- AND THE ABSENCE OF

01:33:11.152 --> 01:33:12.286
THAT IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO

01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:13.521
DETERMINE WHETHER THIS IS THE

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:14.822
APPROPRIATE FUNDING LEVELS OF

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:18.292
POTENTIALLY LESS THAN THIS

01:33:18.359 --> 01:33:19.060
AMOUNT.

01:33:19.126 --> 01:33:20.661
ADDITIONALLY -- THERE IS ANOTHER

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:22.463
QUESTION OF FUNDING SOURCE I

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:23.397
CERTAINLY THE GENERAL FUND IS AN

01:33:23.464 --> 01:33:25.199
OPTION HOWEVER -- IT'S ALSO

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:26.934
POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THE TYPES

01:33:27.001 --> 01:33:28.235
OF ACTIVITIES MIGHT -- QUALIFY

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:30.137
FOR SOME FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL --

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:31.272
SO ANYTHING THAT'S A DIRECT

01:33:31.339 --> 01:33:32.640
SERVICE TO VICTIMS -- COULD

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:36.043
POTENTIALLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:39.013
FEDERAL FUNDS.

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.281
IT COVERS FOR FINANCE JUST WITH

ECHO IT WITH THE INTRODUCTION

01:33:42.883 --> 01:33:43.451
WAS NOT THAT THE AMOUNT THAT STE

01:33:43.517 --> 01:33:44.352
A PROPOSED HERE IS BASED ON

DETERMINED TO INVEST PREVIOUSLY

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:48.990
AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE A NEXUS

01:33:49.056 --> 01:33:50.791
BEHIND HOW WE ARRIVED AT THAT

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:54.795
AMOUNT AND DECIDE TO CONTINUE

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:48.301
INTERVENTION AND IS ALSO FEDERAL

01:56:48.368 --> 01:56:49.168
MONEY THAT COMES IN AND THAT

01:56:49.235 --> 01:56:51.404
MONEY DOES NOT IS NOT ABLE TO GO

01:56:51.471 --> 01:56:52.739

ASSISTANCE PROGRAM BUT ALSO

01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:57.744
BECAUSE THEY CAN PROBABLY SAY

01:56:57.810 --> 01:57:00.546
MORE ABOUT WHY I THAT THAT'S

01:57:00.613 --> 01:57:03.082
WHAT THAT'S THE REASON NO.

01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:03.483

01:57:07.954 --> 01:57:13.860
WE FIND SO MANY THINGS WAS SO.

01:57:13.926 --> 01:57:14.660
SUCH LITTLE DETAIL.

01:57:14.727 --> 01:57:16.362
AND IT'S I THINK THAT'S OUR JOB

01:57:16.429 --> 01:57:17.597
IS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY.

01:57:17.663 --> 01:57:18.498

TO I I DON'T SEE ANYBODY

01:57:22.735 --> 01:57:24.270
FIGHTING.

01:57:24.337 --> 01:57:25.705
FUNDING THIS BUT IF YOU GO TO

01:57:25.772 --> 01:57:28.207

01:57:31.177 --> 01:57:32.879
DETAIL ABOUT HOW THE FUNDS WOULD

01:57:32.945 --> 01:57:34.414
BE ADMINISTERED THE SHORT ANSWER

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:35.515
IS THEY'D BE.

01:57:35.581 --> 01:57:37.183
I'M COMPETITIVE GRANTS THROUGH

01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:39.585
HELLO YES -- ELIGIBLE TO PROGRAM

01:57:39.652 --> 01:57:41.187
SERVING DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL

01:57:41.254 --> 01:57:43.623
VIOLENCE -- SURVIVORS OR THEIR

01:57:43.689 --> 01:57:45.091
COMMUNITIES -- ALREADY WORKING

01:57:45.158 --> 01:57:46.659
ON PREVENTION SO THAT THEY HAVE

01:57:46.726 --> 01:57:48.428
A TRACK RECORD OF KNOWING THIS

01:57:48.494 --> 01:57:49.095
ISSUE.

01:57:49.162 --> 01:57:50.596
WE THINK THAT WITH FIFTY MILLION

01:57:50.663 --> 01:57:52.098
DOLLARS WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE

01:57:52.165 --> 01:57:54.400
TO SATURATE -- AND DO MEANINGFUL

01:57:54.467 --> 01:57:55.968
PREVENTION WORK ACROSS THE STATE

01:57:56.035 --> 01:57:57.236
BUT WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR

01:57:57.303 --> 01:57:58.771
OFFICE AND MAKE SURE YOU ALL

01:57:58.838 --> 01:58:00.440
HAVE THE DETAILS YOU NEED I JUST

01:58:00.506 --> 01:58:01.541
THINK MORE DETAILS CREATURES OR

01:58:01.607 --> 01:58:03.276
STRONGER ARGUMENT FOR THAT THAT

01:58:03.342 --> 01:58:04.477
AMOUNT.

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:04.977
AND BECAUSE THAT IS A

01:58:05.044 --> 01:58:06.345
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT RIGHT NOW

01:58:06.412 --> 01:58:08.448
ABSOLUTELY AND AND IF I MAY UM

01:58:08.514 --> 01:58:09.649
YOU KNOW WITH THE FIVE MILLION

01:58:09.715 --> 01:58:11.184
DOLLARS THIRTEEN AGENCIES WERE

01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:12.018
FUNDED AND SELL.

01:58:12.084 --> 01:58:14.020
THE HOPE IS THAT WE CAN EXPAND

01:58:14.086 --> 01:58:17.089
THAT NOW IF YOU MULTIPLY IT'S

01:58:17.156 --> 01:58:17.890
ANOTHER.

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:18.758
OF POSSIBLY UP TO A HUNDRED

01:58:18.825 --> 01:58:21.227
AGENCIES WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:58:21.294 --> 01:58:23.296
SERVICES THAT ARE BEING --

01:58:23.362 --> 01:58:24.764
PROVIDED IN A THE THE LARGE

01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:27.166
COUNTIES AND THE HOPE IS THAT WE

01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:28.601
CAN -- ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:30.036
ISSUES IN THE RURAL COUNTIES

01:58:30.102 --> 01:58:31.471
THAT DON'T HAVE KIND OF THE

01:58:31.537 --> 01:58:34.140
ROBUST -- SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:35.775
HAVE FOR EXAMPLE IN LA COUNTY

01:58:35.842 --> 01:58:37.477
AND SOUL SOUL YES THE FIFTY

01:58:37.543 --> 01:58:45.017
MULTI MILLION DOLLARS IS --

01:58:45.084 --> 01:58:46.085
QUITE SIGNIFICANT -- BY I ALSO

01:58:46.152 --> 01:58:47.253
FOUND THAT SOME OF THESE --

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:48.020
AGENCIES DON'T HAVE THE

01:58:48.087 --> 01:58:49.388
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE COMPETITIVE

01:58:49.455 --> 01:58:51.023
AND THE GRANT SELECTION PROCESS

01:58:51.090 --> 01:58:52.925
AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO AN ISSUE

01:58:52.992 --> 01:58:53.826
AND YOU KNOW I WOULD BE.

01:58:53.893 --> 01:58:55.127
OBVIOUSLY GET THE INFORMATION

01:58:55.194 --> 01:58:56.729
FOR YOU BUT I THINK IF WE CAN

01:58:56.796 --> 01:58:57.730
HELP SOME OF THOSE RURAL

01:58:57.797 --> 01:58:59.232
COMMUNITIES ALSO BE ABLE TO

01:58:59.298 --> 01:59:00.600
ACCESS THAT MONEY THAT WOULD

01:59:00.666 --> 01:59:01.801
HELP AND I THINK THE FIFTY

01:59:01.868 --> 01:59:03.102
MILLION DOLLARS IS.

01:59:03.169 --> 01:59:05.204
IS IS APPROPRIATE BUT I

01:59:05.271 --> 01:59:07.673
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND I KNOW.

01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:09.141
NOW THAT THIS IS MY THIRD YEAR

01:59:09.208 --> 01:59:10.576
THAT THE THE HIGHER YOU GO THE

01:59:10.643 --> 01:59:13.579
LESS LIKELY WOULD GET FUNDED BY --

01:59:13.646 --> 01:59:16.115
WE ARE PUTTING A LOT OF EMPHASIS

01:59:16.182 --> 01:59:18.751
ON SURVIVORS AND WHICH IS

01:59:18.818 --> 01:59:20.686
APPROPRIATE BUT I ALSO FOUND

01:59:20.753 --> 01:59:23.823
THAT -- A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T

01:59:23.890 --> 01:59:26.225
INVEST IN THE PREVENTION PART OF

01:59:26.292 --> 01:59:28.194
OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SO

01:59:28.261 --> 01:59:30.363
I MY HOPE IS THAT WE SUPPORT

01:59:30.429 --> 01:59:32.632
BOTH THE PREVENTION PART AS WELL

01:59:32.698 --> 01:59:34.433
AS THE SURVIVOR PARTS OF THAT --

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:35.935
THE SURVIVOR PART PART

01:59:36.002 --> 01:59:41.173
EVENTUALLY GETS -- LESS AND LESS --

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:43.009
THERE'S LESS AND LESS NEED

01:59:43.075 --> 01:59:46.078
BECAUSE WE'RE DOING A LOT MORE

01:59:46.145 --> 01:59:48.781
IN THE PREVENTION PART

01:59:48.848 --> 01:59:49.081
[inaudible]

01:59:49.148 --> 01:59:52.418
OKAY I'M -- RIGHT WANT TO THANK

01:59:52.485 --> 01:59:53.219
YOU FOR THE PROPOSED IS ONE OF

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:54.053
THE CHALLENGES IS WHEN WE GET A

01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:55.755
PROPOSAL THIS SIZE IS THAT WE

01:59:55.821 --> 01:59:56.022
PROBABLY.

01:59:56.088 --> 01:59:57.290
WE ALWAYS BELIEVE WE NEED A LOT

01:59:57.356 --> 01:59:57.957
MORE DETAIL RIGHT AS I WAS WHERE

01:59:58.024 --> 01:59:59.458
THE MONEY'S GOING IN EVEN IF IF

01:59:59.525 --> 02:00:00.726
WE'RE DEALING WITH -- AGENCIES

02:00:00.793 --> 02:00:01.894
THAT DON'T HAVE MUCH

02:00:01.961 --> 02:00:03.296
INFRASTRUCTURE SOMETIMES THAT.

02:00:03.362 --> 02:00:05.097
IT IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO

02:00:05.164 --> 02:00:06.198
FUND BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT HAVE

02:00:06.265 --> 02:00:07.600
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACTUALLY

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:09.402
IMPLEMENT OR TO MANAGE OR THE

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:10.970
VALUE WAIT.

02:00:11.037 --> 02:00:12.071
PROGRAM SO THAT BECOMES ANOTHER

02:00:12.138 --> 02:00:14.206
BIOLOGIST WHETHER THEY'RE GOING

02:00:14.273 --> 02:00:14.974
TO BE THE STANDALONE A WEATHER

02:00:15.041 --> 02:00:16.008
GOING TO BE AN UMBRELLA.

02:00:16.075 --> 02:00:19.145
THAT THAT HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:20.012
TO TO DO THE GRANT TO DO THE

02:00:20.079 --> 02:00:21.881
ADMINISTRATION OF IT SOMETIMES

02:00:21.948 --> 02:00:24.250
WE GIVE MONEY TO AGENCIES -- AND

02:00:24.317 --> 02:00:25.484
HOPE THE BILL DO SOME GOOD WORK

02:00:25.551 --> 02:00:27.219
IN THERE AND AND THEY DON'T HAVE

02:00:27.286 --> 02:00:28.754
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO

02:00:28.821 --> 02:00:30.456
IMPLEMENT EVEN DESPITE THE FACT

02:00:30.523 --> 02:00:31.090
THAT THEIR BEST EFFORTS SO THAT

02:00:31.157 --> 02:00:31.757
WOULD BE IMPORTANT.

02:00:31.824 --> 02:00:34.627
WE ALSO HAVE SOME THINGS THAT

02:00:34.694 --> 02:00:38.831
ARE HERE -- AND AND I KNOW THAT.

02:00:38.898 --> 02:00:39.465
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE

02:00:39.532 --> 02:00:40.032
IDENTIFIED IN SO ONE OF THE

02:00:40.099 --> 02:00:42.735
CHALLENGES I FIND WITH WITH MOST

02:00:42.802 --> 02:00:45.304
OF OUR PROPOSALS IS THAT --

02:00:45.371 --> 02:00:46.639
WHAT'S HOT WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:00:46.706 --> 02:00:47.840
THINGS IS GOING ON IN THE STATE

02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:49.108
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS WELL

02:00:49.175 --> 02:00:50.142
COORDINATED.

02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:51.644
BY YOU KNOW WE DO A LOT OF

02:00:51.711 --> 02:00:54.447
THINGS AND SO AS WE SAY YOU KNOW

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:55.381
WITHIN TEETH SAFE AND HEALTHY

02:00:55.448 --> 02:00:56.749
RELATIONSHIP SKILLS WHICH IS

02:00:56.816 --> 02:00:58.951
IMPORTANT -- THAT'S ALSO PART OF

02:00:59.018 --> 02:01:02.088
A HEALTHY KIDS ACTIVE OF OF OF

02:01:02.154 --> 02:01:02.855
TWENTY FIFTEEN SO IT WOULD DO

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.190
ONE THAT AT THAT LEVEL HOW DOES

02:01:04.256 --> 02:01:05.625
THAT INTERFACE WITH WHAT'S GOING

02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:06.659
ON OVER HERE.

02:01:06.726 --> 02:01:10.096
AND ON AND YOU KNOW SO IT'S IT'S

02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:10.863
ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT THINK.

02:01:10.930 --> 02:01:11.664
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE

02:01:11.731 --> 02:01:14.300
VERY IMPORTANT -- LIKE THE ISSUE

02:01:14.367 --> 02:01:17.403
OF HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS OR OR

02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:19.805
OR THIS CASE WITH DEALING WITH --

02:01:19.872 --> 02:01:21.474
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL

02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:22.975
ASSAULT WHAT HAVE YOU YOU KNOW

02:01:23.042 --> 02:01:24.977
WHAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE

02:01:25.044 --> 02:01:26.646
ALREADY.

02:01:26.712 --> 02:01:28.114
AND HOW DO WE COMPLEMENT THAT

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:29.382
AND THEN HOW DO WE MATCH THAT

02:01:29.448 --> 02:01:30.383
WITH OUR OUR NONPROFIT

02:01:30.449 --> 02:01:31.751
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALSO RAISE

02:01:31.817 --> 02:01:33.886
MONEY SO THAT IF OUR AGENCIES

02:01:33.953 --> 02:01:34.987
ARE DOING THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU

02:01:35.054 --> 02:01:36.822
SAY THAT ARE THERE WITH THE

02:01:36.889 --> 02:01:38.190
RESOURCES THAT OF THE YEAR.

02:01:38.257 --> 02:01:39.625
THEN.

02:01:39.692 --> 02:01:41.494
OBVIOUSLY THERE THEY BELIEVE

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:42.395
THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL NEEDS TO

02:01:42.461 --> 02:01:43.729
FOR EXPANSION SO HOW DOES THAT

02:01:43.796 --> 02:01:46.866
ALSO MATCH WITH YOU KNOW SAN

02:01:46.932 --> 02:01:49.135
DIEGO'S PROGRAMS AT THE TO THE

02:01:49.201 --> 02:01:49.735
WHY THEY GETS MONEY.

02:01:49.802 --> 02:01:51.103
FOR A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND

02:01:51.170 --> 02:01:53.673
ASSAULT AND SO WE'RE DOING THAT

02:01:53.739 --> 02:01:55.241
WORK IS THAT IS THE WORK.

02:01:55.307 --> 02:01:56.742
HALF BEING DONE AND THERE'S A

02:01:56.809 --> 02:01:58.711
GREATER NEED THIS THERE ARE YOU

02:01:58.778 --> 02:02:00.579
KNOW WHAT SO I THINK A LITTLE

02:02:00.646 --> 02:02:01.013
BIT MORE.

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:02.381
DISCUSSION OF THAT WOULD BE

02:02:02.448 --> 02:02:05.818
HELPFUL -- AS WE TALK ABOUT

02:02:05.885 --> 02:02:06.886
MEETING CERTAIN NEEDS AND HAVING

02:02:06.952 --> 02:02:08.087
OTHER NEEDS ARE NOT MET YOU KNOW

02:02:08.154 --> 02:02:09.955
BECAUSE THE WORK ON THIS AREA IS

02:02:10.022 --> 02:02:13.693
GOING FORWARD BUT MAYBE NOT AS

02:02:13.759 --> 02:02:15.361
AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE.

02:02:15.428 --> 02:02:17.530
WITH THE YOU KNOW THE PERCEPTION

02:02:17.596 --> 02:02:18.097
IS THAT WE SHOULD REACH MORE

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:20.700
INDIVIDUALS IF WE'RE GOING TO DO --

02:02:20.766 --> 02:02:22.835
EDUCATION -- ARE WE GOING TO DO

02:02:22.902 --> 02:02:23.669
IT IN THE SCHOOL TO WORK WITH

02:02:23.736 --> 02:02:24.804
AND I WOULD HOUSING HAPPENING SO

02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:25.604
I THINK WHEN WHEN WE GET A

02:02:25.671 --> 02:02:27.239
PROPOSAL THIS FIFTY MILLION

02:02:27.306 --> 02:02:27.506
DOLLARS.

02:02:27.573 --> 02:02:29.475
WE JOIN US ON THIS MUCH MORE

02:02:29.542 --> 02:02:31.110
FLESHED OUT THEY DON'T THAN

02:02:31.177 --> 02:02:33.646
SOMEONE WHO ASKS THE TWO

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:34.880
THOUSAND FOUR TWO MILLION WHAT

02:02:34.947 --> 02:02:37.383
DO REAL SWIMMING POOL YOU KNOW

02:02:37.450 --> 02:02:38.417
BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO GIVE THEM

02:02:38.484 --> 02:02:38.718
A COMMUNITY.

02:02:38.784 --> 02:02:39.852
SO LIKE THAT IS A LOT SOMETIMES

02:02:39.919 --> 02:02:41.387
IT'S EASIER TO IDENTIFY THEN IF

02:02:41.454 --> 02:02:42.354
WE'VE GOT A COORDINATED PROJECT

02:02:42.421 --> 02:02:49.795
AND AS SOON.

02:02:49.862 --> 02:02:50.796
THE FIFTY MILLION GHOST OH YES

02:02:50.863 --> 02:02:51.097
[inaudible]

02:02:51.163 --> 02:02:52.965
AND THEN.

02:02:53.032 --> 02:02:54.066
IT IS ADMINISTERED OUT.

02:02:54.133 --> 02:02:58.070
OKAY OKAYED BY HOME I OH YES.

02:02:58.137 --> 02:02:59.338
WITH THE PROPOSES THEY GO OKAY

02:02:59.405 --> 02:03:00.473
AND SO THEN IN THE END WHO

02:03:00.539 --> 02:03:01.741
ASSESSES WHAT HAPPENS.

02:03:01.807 --> 02:03:02.308
SO ALL OF THE GRANT TO THE

02:03:02.374 --> 02:03:02.875
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE REGULAR

02:03:02.942 --> 02:03:05.277
PROGRESS REPORTS TO HELLO YES OF

PAGE AND PUT IT WITH IT.

02:03:17.389 --> 02:03:21.260
SO THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY BECAUSE

02:03:21.327 --> 02:03:22.795
THE DISCUSSION WHERE IF IF IF

02:03:22.862 --> 02:03:23.929
YOU'RE PART OF YOUR PROPOSAL IS

AND THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT IN A

02:03:39.245 --> 02:03:40.579
IN US ASSESSING THE AMOUNT THAT

02:03:40.646 --> 02:03:42.548

AND YOU HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES

02:03:48.921 --> 02:03:50.523
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE

02:03:50.589 --> 02:03:51.757
INCREASE RESOURCES THAT WERE

02:03:51.824 --> 02:03:53.325
GIVEN SOMEONE THAT THEY'VE DONE

02:03:53.392 --> 02:03:54.727
WELL WITH THE AMOUNT WE GIVE

02:03:54.794 --> 02:03:55.795
THEM AND THAT THERE'S A

02:03:55.861 --> 02:03:57.596
RATIONALE FOR INCREASING.

02:03:57.663 --> 02:03:59.064
THE DOLLARS THAT GO FORWARD

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:01.367

BASED BUDGETING IS WHAT WE WERE

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:10.943
CALLING IT.

02:04:11.010 --> 02:04:12.011

THIRD YEAR AND THAT IS THE

02:04:23.355 --> 02:04:24.890
FRUSTRATION THAT THE THE OUT

02:04:24.957 --> 02:04:25.791
FACT THAT SOME OF THESE

02:04:25.858 --> 02:04:27.526
DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT CONNECTED.

02:04:27.593 --> 02:04:31.630

FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY

02:04:39.638 --> 02:04:41.106
DISCONNECTED FROM THE EDUCATION

02:04:41.173 --> 02:04:42.808
SYSTEM INSTEAD OF COORDINATING

02:04:42.875 --> 02:04:43.642
TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FOSTER

SITE AND VERIFICATION YES AND

02:05:08.801 --> 02:05:10.769
ACCOUNTABILITY YOU KNOW BECAUSE

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.438
AS WE HAVE SAID ON THE

02:05:12.504 --> 02:05:13.572
ACCOUNTABILITY WANTING THERE'S

02:05:13.639 --> 02:05:15.174
ALL KIND OF LET'S BE AMENABLE TO

LAST YEAR AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN --

02:05:16.508 --> 02:05:17.576
INCREASE IT BASED ON THE SUCCESS

02:05:17.643 --> 02:05:18.777
OF OF THE LAST TEN MILLION

02:05:18.844 --> 02:05:28.420
DOLLARS THAT DOUBT WILL YOU

02:05:28.487 --> 02:05:31.590
GRACIOUSLY -- BUT COMMITTEE

02:05:31.657 --> 02:05:32.625
APPROVED FOR US THANK YOU AND SO

02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:33.259
I GUESS IT'S A WE'RE WORKING ON

02:05:33.325 --> 02:05:34.126
ON ON ON THE REALITY THAT ALL OF

02:05:34.193 --> 02:05:34.660
THESE THINGS ARE VERY VERY

02:05:34.727 --> 02:05:35.494
IMPORTANT SO THEN THE QUESTION

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:36.061
BECOMES HOW DO WE MATCH IT.

02:05:36.128 --> 02:05:36.695
AND HOW WE MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT

02:05:36.762 --> 02:05:37.263
DUPLICATING SERVICES THAT

02:05:37.329 --> 02:05:37.930
ALREADY EXIST AND THAT'S MY ONLY

02:05:37.997 --> 02:05:39.498
THING IS THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO

02:05:39.565 --> 02:05:40.799
EVEN THINK THAT THE PART I DON'T.

02:05:40.866 --> 02:05:41.800
GET IT I DON'T LISTEN TO BLAME

02:05:41.867 --> 02:05:42.434
THE DEPARTMENT I JUST KNOW THAT

02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:43.903
QUITE OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS WE

02:05:43.969 --> 02:05:45.070
GET A LOT OF PROPOSALS RIGHT TO

02:05:45.137 --> 02:05:47.740
COME IN. FOR VARIOUS THINGS AND

02:05:47.806 --> 02:05:49.909
WITHOUT THINKING BACK TO SAY DO

02:05:49.975 --> 02:05:51.477
WE ALREADY DO THAT IF WE DO HOW

02:05:51.543 --> 02:05:53.245
WELL DO WE DO IT AND HOW MUCH OF

02:05:53.312 --> 02:05:55.147
IT IS BEING DONE IS THIS GOING

02:05:55.214 --> 02:05:56.181
TO BE AUGMENTED WITH THAT VERSES

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:56.749
THAT.

02:05:56.815 --> 02:05:58.250
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN PROPOSAL

02:05:58.317 --> 02:06:00.052
IN OWN IDEAS AND SO WE FIND

02:06:00.119 --> 02:06:02.054
OURSELVES SOMETIMES PROGRAMS

02:06:02.121 --> 02:06:03.622
DUPLICATING EACH OTHER OR EVEN

02:06:03.689 --> 02:06:05.190
NOT EVEN THAT ABLE TO DETERMINE

02:06:05.257 --> 02:06:06.892
HOW MUCH WE'RE GIVING A HOW MUCH

02:06:06.959 --> 02:06:09.128
ARE WE DOING IN CERTAIN AREAS --

IT'S BECOMES EVEN MORE

02:06:10.462 --> 02:06:12.531
COMPLICATED BECAUSE BECAUSE

02:06:12.598 --> 02:06:13.799
PROGRAMS HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES

02:06:13.866 --> 02:06:15.668

OF THE CAUCUS PRIORITIES FOR

THIS YEAR WHICH IS A REQUEST

02:09:44.476 --> 02:09:45.978
THAT THE LEGISLATURE FUNDS

02:09:46.044 --> 02:09:46.678
TWENTY FIVE JUDGESHIPS.

02:09:46.745 --> 02:09:47.913
THOSE JUDGESHIPS WERE CREATED

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:49.381
OVER TEN YEARS AGO BY THE

02:09:49.448 --> 02:09:51.483
LEGISLATURE BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN

02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:52.818
FUNDED DESPITE SEVERAL EFFORTS.

02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:54.553
THE INLAND EMPIRE HAS A SPECIAL

02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:56.622
CONCERN ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE

02:09:56.688 --> 02:09:57.856
SPARE COURT OF SALMON YOU KNOW

02:09:57.923 --> 02:09:59.491
AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES ARE THE

02:09:59.558 --> 02:10:01.693
TWO MOST UNDER STAFFED COUNTIES

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:03.095
IN THE ENTIRE STATE.

02:10:03.162 --> 02:10:04.830
AND I'VE OF SOME PERSONAL

02:10:04.897 --> 02:10:06.465
EXPERIENCE WITH THIS AND VERY

02:10:06.532 --> 02:10:07.466
STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THIS

02:10:07.533 --> 02:10:08.500
BECAUSE BEFORE BEING ELECTED THE

02:10:08.567 --> 02:10:10.002
ASSEMBLY WAS MAYOR OF A CITY

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:11.770
THAT LOST ITS COURTHOUSE DUE TO

02:10:11.837 --> 02:10:13.071
A LACK OF JUDGES.

02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:14.540
SO I GOT TO SEE FIRSTHAND THE

02:10:14.606 --> 02:10:16.775
IMPACT OF THAT LACK OF ACCESS TO

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:18.310
JUSTICE HAS ON A COMMUNITY AND I

02:10:18.377 --> 02:10:19.745
THOUGHT WE HAD A BAD THEN BUT

02:10:19.811 --> 02:10:21.313
NOW I REPRESENTS CITIES LIKE THE

02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:22.314
CITY OF NEEDLES.

02:10:22.381 --> 02:10:23.982
THAT HAS A COURTHOUSE IT'S

02:10:24.049 --> 02:10:25.484
CLOSED IT'S SITTING THERE TO BE

02:10:25.551 --> 02:10:26.919
PERFECTLY FINE THE EXCEPT FOR A

02:10:26.985 --> 02:10:28.153
LACK OF JUDGES TO STEP OUT.

02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:30.055
AND MY CONSTITUENTS NEEDLES HAVE

02:10:30.122 --> 02:10:31.957
TO TRAVEL NOW. THREE AND A HALF

02:10:32.024 --> 02:10:33.225
HOURS DEPENDING ON WEATHER DOT

02:10:33.292 --> 02:10:35.060
IT'S A CRIMINAL MATTER OR A

02:10:35.127 --> 02:10:36.929
CIVIL MATTER BUT BUT THREE THREE

02:10:36.995 --> 02:10:38.130
AND A HALF HOURS TO COURT.

02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:39.765
AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT

02:10:39.831 --> 02:10:41.533
BURDEN IS DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:42.768
IMPACTFUL ON THAT MY

02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:44.036
CONSTITUENTS WHO CAN LEAST

02:10:44.102 --> 02:10:45.370
AFFORD IT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO

02:10:45.437 --> 02:10:47.172
CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE A WHOLE DAY

02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:48.774
OFF OF WORK TO ATTEND COURT.

02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:49.541
OR CAN'T AFFORD THE

02:10:49.608 --> 02:10:51.944
TRANSPORTATION SO -- IT'S IT'S

02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:53.612
REALLY A DIRE ISSUE FOR US --

02:10:53.679 --> 02:10:55.514

SNAPSHOT OF THE VOLUME THAT WE

02:13:01.673 --> 02:13:04.576

02:13:04.643 --> 02:13:06.378
A JUDGE A COURT THAT.

02:13:06.445 --> 02:13:07.546
AS OPPOSED TO HAVE THIRTY EIGHT

02:13:07.612 --> 02:13:08.280
MORE JUDGES ACCORDING THE

WORKLOAD STUDY NEED SOME WHAT WE

02:13:12.684 --> 02:13:13.051
OKAY.

02:13:13.118 --> 02:13:13.885
SO THIS FUNDING REQUEST WOULD

02:13:13.952 --> 02:13:15.253
FUND. TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:16.722
PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED POSITIONS

02:13:16.788 --> 02:13:18.290
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ESTIMATES

02:13:18.357 --> 02:13:18.957
THAT.

02:13:19.024 --> 02:13:20.592
THE CURRENT SHORTAGE OF JUDGES

02:13:20.659 --> 02:13:21.560
CALIFORNIA IT CALIFORNIA'S

02:13:21.626 --> 02:13:23.762
STATEWIDE IS OVER A HUNDRED AND

02:13:23.829 --> 02:13:24.763
EIGHTY NINE SO TWENTY FIVE IS

02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:25.697
JUST A DROP IN THE BUCKET JUST

02:13:25.764 --> 02:13:26.865
TO BE CLEAR EVEN THOUGH.

02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:29.000
THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR THE

02:13:29.067 --> 02:13:29.401
CAUCUS.

02:13:29.468 --> 02:13:31.470
WERE NOT DIRECTING THOSE JUDGES

02:13:31.536 --> 02:13:33.004
TO BE JUST FOR OUR COURTS WE

02:13:33.071 --> 02:13:34.206
WOULD GIVE THEM TO THE GENERAL

02:13:34.272 --> 02:13:35.307
COUNSEL AT THEM ALLOCATE THEM

02:13:35.374 --> 02:13:36.942
AND TRUST THAT SOME OF THOSE

02:13:37.008 --> 02:13:37.843
JUDGES WOULD COME TO US AND

02:13:37.909 --> 02:13:38.610
SOMEONE.

02:13:38.677 --> 02:13:40.178
COME TO OTHER NEEDY PORTIONS OF

02:13:40.245 --> 02:13:42.447
OF THE STATE BUT I WOULD HOPE

02:13:42.514 --> 02:13:43.315
YOU AGREE THAT ONE OF THE

02:13:43.382 --> 02:13:44.916
FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF

02:13:44.983 --> 02:13:46.218
STATE GOVERNMENT IS TO ENSURE

02:13:46.284 --> 02:13:47.586
THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE.

02:13:47.652 --> 02:13:48.920
AND I THINK WE'RE FAILING IN

02:13:48.987 --> 02:13:50.222
THAT DUTY TO SOME OF THESE

02:13:50.288 --> 02:13:52.090
CONSTITUENTS SO I'D DIE REQUEST

02:13:52.157 --> 02:13:53.925
YOUR SUPPORT FOR THAT -- I THINK

02:13:53.992 --> 02:13:56.695
A VERY MODEST BUDGET REQUEST

02:13:56.762 --> 02:13:58.130
OKAY.

02:13:58.196 --> 02:13:59.164
OKAY WELL THANK YOU I MEAN

02:13:59.231 --> 02:14:00.232
OBVIOUSLY IT IS -- IF YOU WANT

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:02.401
TO SHARE THE DATA YOU CAN BUT I

02:14:02.467 --> 02:14:03.769
KNOW WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OKAY TH

02:14:03.835 --> 02:14:05.103
MINISTRY WHAT IT'S THAT'S BEEN

02:14:05.170 --> 02:14:06.171
ON FOR A WHILE.

02:14:06.238 --> 02:14:10.208
AND AND CLEARLY THE THE TRANCE

02:14:10.275 --> 02:14:11.543
THE JUST TRAVELING TO COURTS AS

02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:13.578
A WAS A MAJOR ISSUE WE OPEN SOME

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:15.947
ADDITIONAL ONES BUT EVEN THEN --

02:14:16.014 --> 02:14:17.449
WE ARE NOT AT A PLACE I THINK

02:14:17.516 --> 02:14:18.984
PERSONALLY WHERE WHERE WE CAN

02:14:19.050 --> 02:14:20.519
TRULY SAY THAT WITH EVERYONE HAS

02:14:20.585 --> 02:14:23.822
EQUAL ACCESS. TO JUSTICE -- BUT

02:14:23.889 --> 02:14:25.390
EVEN THOSE JUST.

02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:27.692
THE FACT WE SHUT DOWN EVEN IN

02:14:27.759 --> 02:14:28.560
SAN DIEGO SO MANY BY NIGHT COURT.

02:14:28.627 --> 02:14:29.661
SO THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO

02:14:29.728 --> 02:14:30.662
LEAVE THEIR JOBS JUST TO DEAL

02:14:30.729 --> 02:14:32.164
WITH TRAFFIC TICKETS OR WHATEVER

02:14:32.230 --> 02:14:33.932
MAY BE -- YOU KNOW IS REALLY

02:14:33.999 --> 02:14:36.368
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE MOST FOLKS

02:14:36.435 --> 02:14:37.002
MANY FOLKS WERE IN THAT

02:14:37.068 --> 02:14:39.137
SITUATION BUT THEY HAVEN'T PAID

02:14:39.204 --> 02:14:40.105
THE TICKETS AND THEY'RE CAUGHT

02:14:40.172 --> 02:14:40.839
IN IT.

02:14:40.906 --> 02:14:42.207
THAT'S THAT CYCLE CANNOT AFFORD

02:14:42.274 --> 02:14:43.642
TO TAKE OFF FROM WORK -- TO GO

02:14:43.708 --> 02:14:47.179
TO COURT AND SO IT IS -- WE'RE

02:14:47.245 --> 02:14:48.947
IN A PRETTY SAD STATE BECAUSE

02:14:49.014 --> 02:14:50.549
THAT YOU KNOW IF IT'S NOT

02:14:50.615 --> 02:14:51.950
ACCESSIBLE THEN IT IS JUSTICE

02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:52.951
DENIED.

02:14:53.018 --> 02:14:55.086
AND PEOPLE OFTEN MAKE DEALS ARE

02:14:55.153 --> 02:14:57.088
PLEASE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

02:14:57.155 --> 02:14:58.490
AFFORD TO GO TO COURT.

02:14:58.557 --> 02:14:59.991
AND A AND IT REALLY IS

02:15:00.058 --> 02:15:02.360
UNBELIEVABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE

02:15:02.427 --> 02:15:03.895
THAT FOLKS HAVE TO TRAVEL SO FAR.

02:15:03.962 --> 02:15:08.767
AND SO LONG JUST TO GET TO COURT

02:15:08.834 --> 02:15:10.135
AND WAIT SO LONG.

02:15:10.202 --> 02:15:11.303
AND JUDGES HAVE TO HANDLE THAT

02:15:11.369 --> 02:15:12.337
MANY CASES A DAY WHICH MEANS.

02:15:12.404 --> 02:15:12.971
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN HEAR.

02:15:13.038 --> 02:15:14.339
FOLKS IF YOU ACTUALLY WAITING

02:15:14.406 --> 02:15:15.874
THAT LONG SO WE'LL SEE WHAT WE

02:15:15.941 --> 02:15:17.142
CAN DO I KNOW THAT HASN'T BEEN

02:15:17.209 --> 02:15:18.877

WILL NEVER SEE COMPLIANCE WITH

02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:53.124
THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT.

02:18:53.191 --> 02:18:54.793
AS LONG AS JUDGES AREN'T ABLE TO

02:18:54.859 --> 02:18:56.461
HEAR IN COURT THE WAY THE INDIAN

02:18:56.528 --> 02:18:58.630
CHILD WELFARE ACT IS SUPPOSED TO

02:18:58.697 --> 02:19:00.165
OPERATE AND I JUST AM WHAT TO

02:19:14.345 --> 02:19:15.246
SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES IN

EQUITY CASES HAS BEEN THE

02:19:15.847 --> 02:19:16.848
FAILURE OF TRIBES TO BE

02:19:16.915 --> 02:19:17.749
REPRESENTED.

02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:19.350
THE REASON IS SIMPLE THEY CANNOT

02:19:19.417 --> 02:19:20.118
AFFORD TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY

02:19:20.185 --> 02:19:22.087

ON BEHALF OF THE TRIBE.

02:19:23.555 --> 02:19:24.856
THE RESULT IS THE INTEREST OF

02:19:33.431 --> 02:19:34.232
WHAT.

02:19:34.299 --> 02:19:35.300
THE JUDGES BELIEVE THAT THE BILL

02:19:35.366 --> 02:19:37.368
WILL ENSURE HIGH QUALITY LEGAL

02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:39.070
REPRESENTATION FOR THE TRIBE.

02:19:39.137 --> 02:19:40.271
AND THAT APPELLATE COURTS WOULD

02:19:40.338 --> 02:19:41.306
HAVE THE BENEFIT OF TRAINS

02:19:41.372 --> 02:19:42.807
COUNCIL SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF

02:19:42.874 --> 02:19:43.742
THE TRIBE.

02:19:43.808 --> 02:19:45.210
OUR JUDGES WILL BE BETTER JUDGES

02:19:45.276 --> 02:19:46.578
WITH THE PRESENCE OF THESE

02:19:46.644 --> 02:19:48.379
ATTORNEYS I'M AND WHEN WE WERE

02:19:48.446 --> 02:19:49.647

02:19:51.249 --> 02:19:52.484
WE WERE MAKING TO THE ATTORNEY

02:19:54.486 --> 02:19:55.120
AND NOW TO YOU.

02:19:55.186 --> 02:19:56.187
I'M IS THAT WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE

02:19:56.254 --> 02:19:57.522
THAT THE FUNDING FOR THIS WOULD

02:19:57.589 --> 02:19:59.090
BE OFFSET BY THE MONEY THAT

02:19:59.157 --> 02:20:00.692

CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES --

02:20:10.502 --> 02:20:12.670
BUT JUST IN TERMS OF OFFENDING

02:20:12.737 --> 02:20:13.338
BECAUSE WE'RE HERE AT THE BUDGET

02:20:13.404 --> 02:20:14.539
COMMITTEE.

02:20:14.606 --> 02:20:17.075
I WE DO BELIEVE THAT OVER TIME --

02:20:17.142 --> 02:20:18.910
THE THE THE THE FUNDING WOULD

02:20:18.977 --> 02:20:19.511
BALANCE OUT.

02:20:31.523 --> 02:20:33.158

02:20:33.224 --> 02:20:34.392
FORCE WAS A REPORT THAT WAS

02:20:34.459 --> 02:20:35.794
