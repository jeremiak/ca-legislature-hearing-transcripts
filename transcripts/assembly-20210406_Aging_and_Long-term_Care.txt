OKAY GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE AGING AND LONG TERM CARE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SHIRLEY CROWN AND I AM A SENIOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WITH A CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE MY PRESENTATION TODAY WILL PROVIDE BACKGROUND ON MY RESEARCH INTO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HERE IN CALIFORNIA BASED ON FIFTEEN PLUS YEARS OF BEING ON THE BOARD OF SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS FOCUSING ON THIS ISSUE. THIS LED INTO CREATING THE PROPOSAL AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER SALAS AND INCLUDES MOST OF THE FINDINGS FROM THE UCLA STUDY PRESENTED BY JANET FRANK. MY RESEARCH INVOLVED MAKING CONTACT WITH SEVERAL COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS WHAT I DISCOVERED IS THAT UNDERSERVED OLDER ADULTS WERE FACED WITH THE ABSENCE OF COORDINATED SERVICES WHICH MEANT THAT THERE WAS POOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCONSISTENT REPORTING CRITERIA HOWEVER. SOME COUNTIES PREPARED PLANS REQUESTING FUNDING BUT WHEN FUNDS FOR SUPPLY THE ORGANIZATION ACTUALLY USE THEM FOR OTHER PROJECTS AND NOT MENTAL HEALTH THIS TOLD ME THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH IN MY OPINION IS UNACCEPTABLE. IN ADDITION TO THE ISSUES FACING UNDERSERVED OLDER ADULTS I BEGAN TO SERIOUSLY UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF MENTAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IMPACTING THIS POPULATION. LONELINESS ANXIETY DEPRESSION SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN END OF LIFE ISSUES. THESE ARE TAKING A TOLL ON THIS POPULATION IN ADDITION CHILDREARING IN PLACE SOCIAL ISOLATION FEAR ANXIETY ALONG WITH LIMITED ENGLISH CAPABILITY AND A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ME TECHNOLOGY I DID BUT IDENTIFIES MORE ISSUES FACING THIS POPULATION ACCELERATED BECAUSE OF THE CORVIDS PANDEMIC. AB THREE EIGHTY THREE DOES TO ADDRESS MANY OF IS. ANIKA SOME CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ASPECTS FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THIS IS CRITICAL STANDARDIZE GERIATRICS TRAINING FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER PROVIDERS THAT WOULD COVER. CULTURAL LINGUISTIC ETHICS- JUROR OF THE G. G. DEMOCRATIC DIVERSITY AMONG THIS POPULATION NEEDLESS TO SAY CREATING THE POSITION OF OLDER ADULT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR HAS IDENTIFIED IN THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT FOR INITIATING THE STATE LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. PLUS THIS POSITION WOULD BE FINANCED WITH ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDS IMPORTANT FACT I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PASS THIS BILL AS WE HAVE A GROWING POPULATION IMPACTED BY MENTAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

I KNOW WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PEACE PROGRAM IN FACT HELLO OPTIMA OPERATES A PACE PROGRAM AND PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN RECENTLY ISSUED TWO LETTERS OF SUPPORT FOR PEACE PLAN BUT NEVER SERVICE AREA. OUR CONCERN WITH THE BILL IS WITH THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS- AT SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW KALLONI ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE THE SOLE PROVIDER OF MEDICAL SERVICES IN THEIR SERVICE AREA. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COORDINATION OF CARE WE HAVE THIS BILL CONTEMPLATES HAVING AN EVALUATION- IN AN OPTION PRESENTED TO BE ENROLLED BEFORE THEY ARE ENROLLED IN THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN- AND WE SEE THAT OF THE DETRIMENT TO THE MODEL THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR CLOSE TO THIRTY YEARS- WE HAVE SUGGESTED TO THE SPONSOR AND- AUTHOR OF THAT. INCLUDES COUNTY- THAT WE LEAVE THE ANNULMENT PROCESS THE EMPLOYEES AND THAT WE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT- ON THE EVALUATION- AND- THEN WILL LEASE TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR PACE. AND THEN WORK ON SOME SORT OF A WAY TO INFORM THEM OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY MAKE THEM AWARE- AND PRESENT THEM WITH THAT OPTION BUT WE WOULD LIKE THAT PROCESS DONE AFTER THE ENROLLMENT.

WELCOME MISTER CAP. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN A RISE IN ABUSE CASES INVOLVING INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITIES PROVIDING SUBSTANDARD CARE FOR THE RESIDENTS AND SOME OF THESE FACILITIES THE CARE SO XTREME THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED ELDER ABUSE BECAUSE INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITIES ARE LICENSED IT'S OFTEN THE LOCAL CODE COMPLIANCE ENTITIES TO UNDERTAKE ENFORCEMENT AND CLOSE SUBSTANDARD FACILITIES THROUGH CODE COMPLIANCE CASES CURRENT LAW DESIGNATES SPECIFIC ENTITIES THAT ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE INVESTIGATIVE INFORMATION FROM ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. AB SIX THREE SIX WILL PERMIT ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH CODE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS TO ADDRESS SUBSTANDARD CARE IN INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITIES APPARENT TELEPHONICALLY WITH ME TODAY I HAVE KIMBERLY PIERCE WHO IS THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES MANAGER WITH THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. TOOK ABOUT. THANK YOU OPERATOR. CAN YOU PLEASE FIND THE- MISTER KIMBERLY PIERCE ONLINE. WE DO HAVE ONE THAT IS CUED UP- WE'LL SEE IF IT IS HER LINE SEVENTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

MATALIN COOPER FROM NIELSEN LOOKS MORE ON BEHALF OF CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IN SUPPORT. AND NEXT WE'LL GO TO LINE TEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS KIMBERLY PIERCE I'M GOOD MORNING CHAIR NAZARIAN AND VICE CHAIR VOEPEL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KIMBERLY CHAIRS ON THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES MANAGER FOR THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO'S HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AGING AND INDEPENDENCE SERVICES. IT'S A TODAY IN THE COUNTY IS PROUD TO BE THE SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION. I BELIEVE BILL THIRTY SIX WOULD ALLOW ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH CODE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND THEIR ATTORNEYS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING SOME STANDARD INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITIES. HOUSING OLDER AND DEPENDENT ADULT. IT'S NO SECRET TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT ARE POP OUR POPULATION IS AGING ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA'S NEW MASTER PLAN FOR AGING THE STATE OVER SIXTY POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO DIVERSIFY AND GROW FASTER THAN ANY OTHER AGE GROUP. BY TWENTY THIRTY TEN POINT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS WILL BE AN OLDER ADULT MAKING UP ONE QUARTER OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. WITH THIS INCREASE COMES SEVERAL CHALLENGES ONE OF WHICH IS AN INCREASED PREVALENCE OF- ELDER ABUSE INCLUDING FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION EMOTIONAL ABUSE PHYSICAL ABUSE SEXUAL ABUSE AND NEGLECT. FURTHERMORE THERE'S BEEN A PARALLEL RISE IN ABUSE CASES INVOLVING SUB STANDARD INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITIES THEY'RE KNOWN AS IOWA. I'LL LOVE BURKE I'M LICENSED FACILITIES THAT PROVIDE CARE TO MULTIPLE IN THE INDIVIDUAL IN ONE RESIDENT. AT THE COST OF IN LICENSE FACILITIES RISES THE DEMAND FOR THAT LEVEL OF CARE MORE AND MORE VULNERABLE LOW INCOME ADULTS ARE RELYING ON I'LL LEFT FOR THEIR CARE NEEDS. UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THESE FACILITIES PROVIDE EXTREMELY SUBSTANDARD CARE WHICH CAN BE- CAN MEET THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF THE OLDER GEAR. FOR LICENSED FACILITIES APS CAN EASILY SHARE INFORMATION WITH A LICENSING AGENCIES SUCH AS COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING. HOWEVER FOR IOS CLOSURES OFTEN ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH LOCAL CODE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. DOWN THERE ATTORNEY. INSIGNIA IN RECENT WORKING HAS BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO ROOT OUT THE SILENCE THAT ARE BAD ACTORS BROUGH CODE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. DUE TO CURRENT LAW APS CANNOT ASSIST THOSE EFFORTS WITHOUT A COURT ORDER INCLUDING EVEN CONFIRMING FOR THEM WHICH ADDRESSES WE HAVE VISITED FREQUENTLY TO INVESTIGATE ABUSE. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR ATS TO SEE I- LEFT WITH SHEETS HANGING FROM THE CEILING IN ROOMS CREATING MAKESHIFT WALLS BETWEEN MULTIPLE BUNK BEDS. GETTING AS MANY RESIDENTS INTO ONE ROOM AS POSSIBLE OR TO SEE FAULTY WIRING IN ONE CASE A PS WITH INVESTIGATING THEIR OF A HOT ELECTRICAL WIRE RUNNING THROUGH THE SHOWER CREATING SHOCK TO ANYONE WHO TOOK A SHOWER. WE'VE SEEN UNSAFE GATES LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE PREVENTING CLIENTS FROM BEING ABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE FIRE AND EMERGENCY AND PREVENTING FIRST RESPONDERS FROM BEING ABLE TO GAIN ACCESS QUICKLY. CURRENT WHAT DESIGNATES THIS. ENTITIES THAT ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE INVESTIGATIVE INFORMATION FROM EIGHT PM. WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE ONE FIVE SIX ONE ZERO POINT FOUR FIVE LIMITS THE TERM TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WHICH MEANS ONLY LOCAL POLICE SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES AND PROBATION OFFICERS. ATS OF THE BILITY TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH CODE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE SEVERELY LIMITED BY THIS DEFINITION BECAUSE CODE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO THE STATE LAW INCLUDED IN THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW APS TO SHARE INVESTIGATORY INFORMATION WITH CODE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS TO ALLOW CODE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO MORE EFFICIENTLY AND THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE AND TO SHUT DOWN. SUB STANDARD IOWA. LASTLY THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW APS TO SURE NOT. INFORMATIONAL A FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SPECIFICALLY CHARGED WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ELDER OR DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE AND CROSSERS FICTIONAL CASES. ACROSS THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES COORDINATE ON CASES THAT CROSS STATE LINES DOWN THAT PREY ON SENIOR CITIZENS. WITH TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO STATE WHY INCLUDED IN THIS BILL THE COORDINATION CALIFORNIA WILL BE MORE FOCUSED EFFICIENT AND TIMELY. INFORMATION WILL ONLY BE SHARED WITH FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CHARGED WITH THE INVESTIGATION- ELDER DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE AND FOR THE FULL PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING A PROPERTY WHERE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF AN- ELDER OR DEPENDENT ADULT RATHER THAT IS AT RISK. FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL GRANT PROGRAMS THAT- PREY ON OLDER ADULTS AND OUR- TYPICALLY FINANCIAL WE HAVE- OLDER ADULTS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO SPENT THEIR LIFE SAVINGS TO CRIMINAL. AND CURRENTLY WE CANNOT PROVIDE THE FEDERAL AGENCIES INVESTIGATING THESE CRIMES WITH THE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RESIDENTS. OF FALLEN VICTIM. IN APS WE SEE ROMANCE SCAMS WHICH ARE US SCAMS WHERE A CLIENT BELIEVES THERE ARE IN A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE WHO THEY REALLY ONLY MET ON THE INTERNET. THEIR GROUP OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND EVENTUALLY ASKED FOR MONEY TO HELP WITH SOME BALLPARK CHIP THAT. THE SCAMMER HAS TOLD THEM ABOUT. WE'VE SEEN QUITE WHOSE ON INTO OF DOLLARS DEPLETING THEIR LIFE SAVINGS BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEY'RE HELPING THEIR FIANCEE THE BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND. I INTO TAKING OUT LOANS SECOND MORTGAGES AT TIMES WE'VE SEEN THEM WITH THEIR OWN HOMES. THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IS VERY CLEAR AND VERY SPECIFIC FOR REASON INFORMATION CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE SHARED OR USED FOR FEDERAL IMMIGRATION PURPOSES. ASSEMBLY BILL SIX THIRTY SIX WILL ALLOW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DOWN THE RETURNEES ON FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY CHARGED WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF ELDER ABUSE TO INVESTIGATE AND SHUT DOWN SUB STANDARD INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITIES THAT PREY UPON. OLDER INDEPENDENT ADULTS ASSEMBLY BILL SIX THIRTY SIX PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS AND ENSURES OLDER ADULTS HAVE THE CARE THEY NEED AND DESERVE. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL.
