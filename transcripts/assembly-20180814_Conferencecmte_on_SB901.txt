WE ARE GOING TO CONVENE THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON S. B. NINE NO ONE DIED AND TODAY'S CONVERSATION WILL FOCUS ON WHILE FOR FUELS REDUCTION. AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT -- AS THE COMMITTEE IS -- MOVING INTO ITS FOURTH MEETING HOW WE CLEARLY ARE -- WITH A LOT OF THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE ISSUE OF STRICT LIABILITY -- BUT THERE IS OF VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH TODAY THAT I THINK. IS GOING TO BEAR A LOT OF HEAVINESS AND AND ALSO OUR RESPONSIBILITY ON THE COMPLETE MEANT COMPLETED BEST OF THIS. COMMITTEES WORK AND AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE ISSUES OF FUEL AND REDUCING THE FUEL. AND IN OUR WILDERNESS AREA IS A CRITICAL. SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO NOT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE HERE TO TESTIFY AS WITNESSES BUT ALSO. MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEE WHO HAVE BEEN DEALING OF WITH THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS CERTAINLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD I HAVE A PUT A GREAT DEAL OF FOCUS APPROPRIATELY SO ON THIS TOPIC IN THE COMMITTEE. WILL BE LOOKING A TO THEIR COMMENTS A TODAY'S WELL ABOUT TO START OFF I WILL BEFORE WE INTRODUCE THE FIRST PANEL -- I TO MY CULTURE TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY OPENING COMMENTS. I LIKE TO ASSIST. I WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH MY CO CHAIRMAN. YOU'RE NOT LAUGHING SO YOU PROBABLY WORK AT THE LAST MEETING. ONE PERSON ARE. HOW SO LET'S GO FORWARD -- TO DISCUSS THE BACKGROUND ON FIRE PREVENTION AND PENDING LEGISLATION OF THAT PANEL WILL CONSIST OF SCOTT STEVENS PROFESSOR FIRE SCIENCE UC BERKELEY. A CRAIG THOMAS CONSERVATION DIRECTOR SIERRA FOREST LEGACY. AND WILLIAM CRAVEN CHIEF CONSULTANT SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER COMMITTEE. MICHAEL JARED SENIOR CONSULTANT ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES. IF YOU COULD ALL COME FORWARD. AND WE YOU CAN LEAD OFF IN THE ORDER THAT YOU RECALL GOOD MORNING ARTS AFTERNOON SCOTT STEVENS FROM UC BERKELEY I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT AND FIRED FUELS. FIRST THING I WAS GONNA SPEAK TO ASSIST A FEW SUCCESS STORIES NO ONE HERE BUT FIRED FUELS IN. WHAT'S GOING ON OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW YOU ALWAYS WONDER IS THERE ANY SUCCESSES OUT THERE AND THEY REALLY ARE SUCCESSES BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT JUST FOR A MOMENT. WHEN PLACES FLORIDA THE STATE OF FLORIDA IS THE LEADER A PRESCRIBED FIRE AND FUEL HAZARD MANNER MANAGEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES? WE THINK FOR OF ALL PLACES FOR THE VERY PYRO CENTRIC STATE LOT OF FIRE THEY BURNED ONE POINT TWO MILLION ACRES LAST YOU PRESCRIBE BURNING. THEY DID PRETTY WELL THEY DID HAVE ONE ESCAPE THAT ACTUALLY THE TRAGEDY ONE THAT HASN'T HAPPENED ABOUT FORTY YEARS. STILL THEY DO A LOT OF GOOD WORK IN FLOOR AND IT SHOWS IS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAYBE DO MORE PROACTIVE FUELS MANAGEMENT IN A PLACE WITH THE HAS INCREDIBLE BIG. WHILE IN URBAN INTERFACE WESTERN AUSTRALIA WESTERN AUSTRALIA PERTH IS ANOTHER AREA OF THE WORLD WHERE. BIG PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAM THEY BRING ONE TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AROUND PERTH PERTH HAS OVER MILLION PEOPLE. SO THEY HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE FIFTY YEAR PROGRAM OF ACTUALLY DOING PROACTIVE BURNING AND ACTUALLY WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES AND ALSO ECOSYSTEMS ANOTHER PLACE THAT ANOTHER SUCCESS STORY. ENTER THE FORCE YOU KNOW WE SAW THE HIGH MORTALITY ADVANCE OF THAT SOUTHERN SIERRA LAST FEW YEARS AND HUNDRED MILLION TREES PLUS DYING AND THEN THERE ARE THE PLACES WE ACTUALLY SEE THAT FORCED A MUCH MORE RESILIENT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A LOWER DENSITIES MORE HAD ORIGINATING MORE VARIABILITY. ONE SUCH PLACE THIS YEAR'S AND PAGE MARK HERE NORTHERN WESTERN MEXICO AND WORKING ON THEIR TWENTY YEARS. THAT PLACE HAS THE SAME DROUGHT TO GET BURNED BY WILDFIRES WE GO DOWN THERE EVERY TIME I GO DOWN THERE I AM INSPIRED. BECAUSE OF JUST THE INCREDIBLE RESILIENCE THAT FORCED. THREE YEAR DROUGHT FALL BY A WILDFIRE SO IF TO PLACE IT ACTUALLY EVERY TIME I GO THERE WAS THERE ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO FOR PUBLIC THE TWENTIETH TIME EVERY TIME I GO THERE AND WORK. I JUST REALIZED WHAT CALIFORNIA FORCE COULD BE. WITH A LOOK AT MORE ACTIVITY IN TERMS OF MANAGEMENT FEELS TREATMENT. ELECTRIC BASS AND HAS A PLACE IN THE SEMI NATIONAL PARK HAS BEEN MANAGED BY LIGHTNING FIRE FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS SO THIS IS AN AREA REMOTE COUNTRY WHERE YOU CAN PUT FIRE ON THE GROUND BY LIGHTNING ALLOW IT TO BURN. MOST TIME FIRES GOING ON THEIR OWN. THEY'VE HIT EACH OTHER AND THEY SIMPLY GO OUT AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING UP THERE FOR MANY YEARS AND WE SEE THE HEADERS AND EIGHTEEN ALSO THE LOWER DENSITIES HIGH DENSITY AREAS. AND THERE'S ACTUALLY SEEM TO BE A CO BENEFIT WERE SEEN MORE WATER COMING FROM THE WATERSHEDS VILLA CREEK. SO WE SEEM TO HAVE A WATER COULD BENEFIT. ONE OTHER THING I MIGHT TO SAY IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE DONE SOME WORK HERE IN BLODGETT FORCED BLODGETT FORCES THE UC BERKELEY RESEARCH FORCE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT FEEL TREATMENTS BOTH THINNING. PRESCRIBED BURNING THINNING AND PRESCRIBE BRING TOGETHER. WE WORKED UP THERE ALMOST TWENTY YEARS ON THIS AND WE'VE REALLY COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FUEL TREATMENTS DESIGNED FOR RESTORATION THE TARGET LADDER FUELS SMALLER TREES. ECOLOGICALLY ARE DOING ANY HARM SO WHEN WE LOOK AT REALLY HOW YOU MIGHT DO AN IMPLEMENTATION FORCE IN CALIFORNIA BLODGETT SHOWS US THAT WE CAN DO A LOT OF GOOD WORK AND REALLY HAVE NO ECOLOGICAL. PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF THOSE FORCE. SO WHAT ABOUT A COUPLE QUICK THINGS ABOUT CALIFORNIA WHAT THINGS MIGHT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT IF WE GO FORWARD. CALIFORNIA HAS ITS VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM ENVIRONMENT IMPACT REPORT THIS IS BEEN SOMETHING GOING ON FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS OR LONGER THIS IS A PROGRAMMATIC. DOCUMENT THAT WILL ACTUALLY ALLOW. THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PLAN PROGRAMS IMPLEMENT PRESCRIBED BURNING MORE EFFICIENTLY. IT'S BEEN STUCK IN THE BOARD OF FORESTRY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS -- WE ACTUALLY GET A PEER REVIEW FOR THAT FOR THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SCIENCE CONSORTIUM ABOUT. THREE FOUR YEARS AGO OUTSIDE PANEL HELD PUBLIC MEETINGS THE DOCUMENTS SEEM TO BE PRETTY GOOD SHAPE BUT IT IS SOMEHOW STUCK IN THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AT THAT CAME OUT I THINK WE COULD ACTUALLY SEE SOMETHING POSITIVE. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE I THINK ABOUT THINGS COULD HAPPEN. I THINK MANY OF US MIGHT TALK ABOUT THE PACE AND SCALE TREATMENTS ON THE ADVOCATE FOR TRYING TO DO MORE TRYING TO DO BETTER IN TERMS IT ECOLOGICALLY DOING FUEL TREATMENT BECAUSE WE AREN'T DOING ENOUGH. ESPECIALLY IN FORCE WE TALK ABOUT TROUBLING TO DEFER CONVERSATION UNFORTUNATELY WE TALK ABOUT FORCE WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER BACK OF THE ENVELOPE CALCULATION WE NEED TO DO FIVE TO TEN TIMES MORE PER YEAR. TO REALLY GET A HANDLE ON THIS AND WE COULD DO IT ECOLOGICALLY. NOTHING I WOULDN'T MENTION IS IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO BREACH THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA KNOW WE HAVE URBAN WHILE AN INTERFACE WE HAVE FORCE RESILIENCY PROBLEMS. UNIVERSAL CALIFORNIA HAS AN EXTENSION SERVICE FOR WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY DO OUTREACH WE DO THIS AND THINGS LIKE RAIN SCIENCE WE GET IN AGRICULTURE WE GET A LOT OF DIFFERENT FIELDS. WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA DUDE AND FIRE. SITE ONE THING I THINK WOULD BE INTERESTING BECAUSE MAYBE HAVE A FOCUSED OUTREACH PROGRAM THAT ACTUALLY [inaudible] IN COUNTIES PEOPLE OF MASTER'S DEGREES THAT WOULD WORK COLLECTIVELY WITH CITY COUNCIL'S BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PUBLICS AND BRING THE IDEAS OF WHAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO LOCALLY AND TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. LIKE US ALL THE PROBABLY WOULD REDUCE THE PROBLEM. I'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN SO MANY OTHER PARTS OF KIND OF NATURIST HORSES WE KNOW ENOUGH TO DATE THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE PREPARE FOR FIRE AND DO BETTER. SO I THINK THIS IDEA PUTTING PEOPLE IN NATURAL RESOURCE FIELDS INTO COUNTIES WHERE PEOPLE LIVE WOULD BE A REALLY INTERESTING WAY TO GO AND GIVE US A CALIFORNIA'S HAD SOME SUCCESS WITH SOME OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THAT. MISTER STEVENS AND I HATE TO INTERRUPT YOUR AYE I SHOULD HAVE SAID AT THE VERY BEGINNING WE'RE GOING TO ALLEN FIVE MINUTES TO EACH THE PRISONERS. AND SO HAVING NOT GIVING YOU THAT A PRE WARNING IF YOU CONCLUDE IN THE NEXT AND I AM LIKE THAT WAS ACTUALLY MY LAST LITTLE COMMENT SO THE ONLY THING I'D ACTUALLY WANT TO CLOSE WITH THIS HOPE. YOU NO BECAUSE I CAN'T AGAIN I FEEL SOMETIMES WITH ON CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE THIS I GET THE NEW NORMAL. IS THIS THE NEW NORMAL THAT'S AN INTERESTING TOPIC THE IDEA OF NEW NORMAL KIND OF FEELS LIKE TO ME WERE KIND OF GIVEN UP. I THINK THAT THE NEW NORMAL ACTUALLY CANCEL HAVE INCREDIBLE INPUT FROM MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVITY THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY DO BETTER IN THE FUTURE SO I'M VERY HOPEFUL WHEN IT COMES A FIRE IN THE STATE THANK YOU. MY NAME IS CRAIG THOMAS WAS AIRFORCE LEGACY AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TODAY -- I'LL SPEAK TO THREE THINGS QUICKLY FIRE PREVENTION FIRE PLANNING [inaudible] FOREST HEALTH. FIRE PREVENTION IS ABOUT PREVENTING UNCHARACTERISTIC FIRE. WHILE EXPANDING THE BENEFICIAL USES A FIRE IN CALIFORNIA. THE POINT IS THE FIRST POINT IS THAT CALIFORNIA POLICY MAKERS HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT CALIFORNIA SCIENTISTS AND LAND MANAGERS ALREADY KNOW FIRE HAS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN SHAPING AND BUILDING RESILIENCE IN THE DIVERSE LANDSCAPES OF OUR STATE FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS? WE NEED TO WORK ON LIMITING UNCHARACTERISTIC DAMAGING FIRES WHILE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING THE ROLE OF BENEFICIAL FIRE FROM MULTIPLE RESOURCE BENEFITS. THOSE BENEFITS INCLUDE ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE. CARBON STABILITY REDUCED EMISSIONS AND IMPACTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND FINALLY COMMUNITY PROTECTION. WE ALL KNOW THIS. AND THIS YEAR'S LEGISLATIVE SEASON PARTICULARLY -- I'LL CALL IT SENATOR JACKSON'S COMPREHENSIVE FIRE BILL WE'VE REALLY MOVE THE BALL IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION WE NEED TO KEEP THIS UP. FOR EVER IN THE STATE UNTIL WE GET THIS LANDSCAPE RESTORED. IN TERMS OF AND I'VE LISTED A BUNCH OF IN THE HAND OUT A LIST OF THE BUNCH OF REFERENCES THAT YOU MIGHT WANNA LOOK AT THERE'S TREMENDOUS WORK GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THEM -- AND THAT IS THE FIRE IN WILL YOU PARTNERSHIP WHICH IS THIRTY THREE PARTNERS NOW IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING CAL FIRE AND SEE YOU IN ABOUT A CONSERVANCY FOR SERVICE. AND OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND AN ASTOUNDING THING IS WE'RE FROM TO AND A SIGN OF PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE THREE AIR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE JOINED. THE FIRE I AM ARE YOU PARTNERSHIP TO PROMOTE EXPANDING FIRE USE FOR ECOLOGICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS. IN TERMS OF FIRE PLANNING. I THINK THE FIRST PRINCIPAL NEEDS TO BE THAT THERE IS NO NO FIRE OPTION IN CALIFORNIA. TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND THEN WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE USE OF THE STATE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH OPR WILDFIRE PLANNING GUIDELINES TO LINK IS LISTED THERE. IT'S ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE ON THE TABLE IN ALL THESE ADOPTED OF ALL COUNTY GENERAL PLANS. WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO FIRE HISTORY FIRE REGIME TOPOGRAPHY SLOPE BUILDING MATERIALS EMERGENCY ACCESS AND MORE. RIGID LINES SHOULD BE FOR OPEN SPACE AND BIKE TRAILS NOT DENSELY PACKED MILLION DOLLAR HOMES. THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENT IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT COMES UP A LOT WHEN WE'RE IN RURAL AREAS MANY OF YOU COME FROM RURAL LANDSCAPES. IT'S MANDATORY IT'S NOT OPTIONAL BUT WE'RE STILL ACTING LIKE IT'S OPTIONAL. IT IS MANDATORY HOME CLEARANCE WORK NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD IT TO GET THE WORK DONE [inaudible] AND WE ARE IN A PUBLIC SAFETY CRISIS AND HOPE PROTECTION IS NOT OPTIONAL WE NEED TO SUPPORT FOLKS BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MANDATE REQUIRE THAT IT GETS DONE. HOME HARDENING IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL AND THIS PENDING LEGISLATION IN FRONT OF LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR IT HAS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT SUPPORTING HOME HARDENING IN EXPANDING RESOURCES TO PROTECT HOMES. ADDITIONAL WATER SUPPLIES MAINTAIN CLEARANCE RETROFITTED HOMES COMMUNITY WIDE EFFORTS TO CREATE LARGER LANDSCAPES. ARE ALL IMPORTANT THINGS IN TERMS OF BUILDING FIRE RESILIENCE IN THE MOVIE IN PARTICULAR. DOING THE WORK AND AND UP DON'T ALWAYS EXPECT AN ENGINE THAT'S GOING TO COME AND SAVE YOU. IT OFTEN IS NOT THE CASE WE HAVE TO TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR LIVING IN THESE FIRE SO CHEATED LANDSCAPES. I WANT A SECOND WHAT SCOTT SAID BRIEFLY ABOUT THE EXPANDED ROLE OF YOU SEE FIRE ADVISORS. PROVIDING DIRECT SUPPORT TO PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO RESTORE FIRE ON THEIR LANDS OR BY FORMING PRESCRIBED BURN ASSOCIATIONS WERE COMMUNITIES WORK TOGETHER TO EXPAND FIRE RESTORATION AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. WERE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT I PERSONALLY ATTENDED A WORKSHOP THAT WASN'T. CREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN BUILDING AND BRINGING THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER THAT KNEW. SOMETHING ABOUT FIRE BUT THEY HAVE ACTUAL GROUP TORCH IN THEIR HANDS AND WORKING TO REDUCE FUELS ON THEIR PROPERTY WAS AMAZING. LAST THING IS FOR US HEALTH AND NOW OFFER THAT FIRE RESILIENCE. AND FOREST HEALTH OR NOT SEPARATE ISSUES. THE ORIGIN OF FOREST HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA BEYOND NATURAL BACKGROUND LEVELS OF PROBLEMS. IS A DIRECT RESULT OF HISTORIC FIRE EXCLUSION IN THE HIGH GRADING AND CLEAR CUTTING OF LARGE FIRE RESILIENT TREES. ABSENT THE REINTRODUCTION OF PLAN FIRE AS A MAJOR MANAGEMENT TOOL AN INCREASE PROTECTIONS AND INCENTIVES FOR LARGE TO RESTORE LARGE ECOLOGICALLY APPROPRIATE TREES WE WILL NEVER REACH. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF NEVER REACH RESILIENCE ON A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CALIFORNIA LANDSCAPE. WERE MECHANICAL TREATMENTS ARE REQUIRED OVERLY DENSE STANDS UNCHARACTERISTIC DENSE TREES CLOSE PROXIMITY TO COMMUNITIES. THERE'S A BROAD SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS THAT TREATING LADDER FUELS SHOULD STILL BE THE PRIMARY CONCERN. THE SURFACE ON LADDER FUELS SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY CONCERN IN TARGET FOR LIMITING FIRE BEHAVIOR SMALLER TREES UP TO SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THAT COMPONENT. FINALLY THE THING THE NEGLECTED STEPCHILD OF ALL OF OUR REAR RESTORATION EFFORTS IS MAINTAINING THE BENEFITS THAT WE PRODUCED ON THE LANDSCAPE I'VE GOT A THIRTY YEAR HISTORY. OF WITNESSING WORK BEING DONE SOME OF IT NOT GREAT SOME OF IT GREAT SOME OF IT WE HAD A DIRECT HAND IN. BUT THE FAILURE TO COME BACK AND MAINTAIN THAT RESILIENCE IS A ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL TRAGEDY FOR ALL THE SOCIAL CAPITAL AND DOLLARS THAT WE'VE INVESTED. TO FIRE AS A PRIMARY MAINTENANCE TOOL IN THESE TREATMENTS SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT OF AS DOES A OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE JUST PUT OFF ON THE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND FORGET ABOUT ITS FREQUENT FIRE AND RESTORING SELF LIMITING EFFECTS OF NATURAL FIRE. WOULD ALSO LIMIT UNCHARACTERISTIC OF BY OF TREES THAT WE SEE ON THIS LANDSCAPE NOW THAT ARE CAUSING THE BIG FIRE BEHAVIOR PROBLEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] PRESCRIBE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- BILL CRAVEN WITH THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER COMMITTEE MICHAEL AND I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A QUICK SURVEY. TO THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. OF ALL THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE. ON THE GENERAL TOPIC OF PREVENTION -- IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR AND THE TAKE AWAY HOPE WHEN WE'RE BOTH FINISHED. IS THAT A LOT OF MEMBERS AND A LOT OF STAFF. AND A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE IN PUTTING TOGETHER. THESE BILLS -- YOU HAVE TWO HANDOUTS FROM US ONE AND DESCRIBES THE BILLS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT. THE SECOND -- DESCRIBES ALL OF THEIR PONTS IN EACH BILL. THE FIRST HAND OUT ALSO INCLUDES ALL THE WORK THAT WAS DONE ON THIS TOPIC IN THE RECENTLY APPROVED BUDGET. WHICH IS -- ALSO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK BY THE LEGISLATURE IN ADDRESSING PREVENTION -- WE'RE BASS OR MOSTLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BILLS THAT WE HAVE HELPED SHAPE -- THIS SESSION BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I WANT TO MENTION THAT THERE ARE. OTHER BILLS -- THAT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF FIRST IS SENATOR MONIES BILL S. B. CAN SEVENTY NINE THAT AUTHORIZES ADVANCE PAYMENTS. THAT FOR VARIOUS FORESTRY GRANTS -- FUNDED BY A CAP AND TRADE RIGID YOUR FANS. THAT'S ALL I'M ASSEMBLY THIRD READING -- MISTER PATTERSON'S BILL AB NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR EXTENDS AN EXEMPTION -- SO THAT LANDOWNERS CAN REMOVE -- TREES THAT THREATENED STRIKE -- ARM. SOMEHOW THAT BILLS ALREADY TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK -- THE GUY. YEAH AND ALSO THERE'S A BILL ON SENATE INACTIVE BY MISS CABALLERO A BEFORE -- TWENTY FIVE I WOULDN'T BE A BIT SURPRISED IF THAT BILL BECOMES REACTIVATED -- TO CONTAIN. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS -- IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT MISTER DALI IS A CO AUTHOR OF THAT BILL -- SO OF THE BILLS THAT -- MICHAEL AND I WORKED ON I JUST WANNA START WITH -- A MAJOR EFFORT BY SENATOR JACKSON SP. TWELVE SIXTY THAT TOUCHES BOTH ON LOCAL PLANNING AND PRESCRIBED FIRE -- FOR FOR LOCAL PLANNING -- IT BASICALLY APPROVED IMPROVE THE CONSULTATION PROCESS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE BOARD OF FORESTRY. AND REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REFLECT THE OPR GUIDANCE THAT -- CRAIG MENTIONED EARLIER -- AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN STILL AND HER CONSTRUED MEET OR EXCEED STATE REGULATIONS AND SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE DONE SO -- MICHAEL'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT -- THOSE OTHER BILLS A DEAL PROVISIONS. BUT ON THE TOPIC A PRESCRIBED FIRE SENATOR JACKSON'S BILL. CONTAINS SEVERAL PIECES THAT I THINK -- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR YOU KNOW OF THE FIRST GIG AUTHORIZES THEM A AGREEMENTS BY THE DEPARTMENT HELLFIRE AND LANDOWNERS TO UNDERTAKE PRESCRIBED FIRE. IT BUILDS ON THE ALLOCATION IN THE BUDGET THAT I JUST MENTIONED KRUEGER DISTRICTS PUBLIC EDUCATION ON PRESCRIBED FIRES NEW EQUIPMENT SO THAT. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE BURNING HAVE THE BEST AVAILABLE WEATHER HUMIDITY. AND WIND INFORMATION -- AND THERE ARE DEDICATED CREWS NOW TO CAL FIRE FOR PRESCRIBED FIRES THAT'S A HUGE STEP -- IT ELEVATES CALIFORNIA'S RULE IN ADMINISTERING PRESCRIBED FIRES ACROSS THE STATE REQUIRES A CURRICULUM AND TRAINING CURRICULUM PRESCRIBED FIRE. THE REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT. TO COOPERATE WITH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LANDOWNERS. STREAMLINED AND IT THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW A PRESCRIBED FIRE PROJECTS BY ALLOWING TEARING FROM THAT HE AYE ARE IS THAT -- DOCTOR STEVENS JUST MENTIONED. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT. PROJECTS TO TEAR FROM THE CI OUR WINNER GETS FINALIZED -- CAN RELY ON THAT YEAH I ARE FOR ITS -- FOR THE MITIGATION. IDENTIFIED IMPACTS AND IF YOU IMPACTS HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED OR MITIGATED PARA PROVIDE FOR MITIGATION. IN THAT HE AYE ARE IN THE PROJECT WOULD HAVE TO FULFILL -- COVERED IN THE DRAFT. AND SO WE'RE STILL IN NEGOTIATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION REGARDING -- SPECIAL PROTECTIONS FOR CHAPARRAL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- BUT THIS IS PROBABLY -- THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PRESCRIBED FIRE BILL OF THE YEAR IN LEAST IN MY VIEW -- I WANT TO BRIEFLY MENTION TWO OTHER BILLS. FIRST -- AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN BY MISS AGUIAR-CURRY AND WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FINAL PANEL BUT THE IDEA IS. THAT WE NEED TO USE SMALLER DIAMETER TREES WE NEED TO TAKE HIM OUT OF THE FOREST YOU DO USE THEM CONSTRUCTIVELY. WE NEED TO JUMPSTART THE INDUSTRIES AND INCUBATE THE INDUSTRIES OF THAT CAN USE THESE TREES FOR CONSTRUCTIVE PURPOSES IN IN IN THE STATE -- AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST MISTER WOODS BILL AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY ONE ADDS PROVISIONS FOR REGARDING PRESCRIBED FIRE CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW LOANS TO SMALL LANDOWNERS. UNDER THE BATES YOU WE APPRECIATE. AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION I THINK THAT ALL WILL AGREE THAT IT'S A VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND GIVES US A GOOD VIEW OF THE KIND OF WORK THAT'S BEING. UNDER WAY AMONGST OTHER MEMBERS. WE WILL -- TURNED TO MEMBERS OF YOUR HOUSING [inaudible] I'M SORRY. PAST SIMON'S MICHAEL JAROD I WORK FOR THE ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE -- AND I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THE THE REST OF THE BILLS IN THE HAND OUT -- JUST AS SOME INTRODUCTORY REMARKS YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED AT A RESOURCE COMMITTEE FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LEGISLATION -- THIS YEAR THAT'S GONE FOR COMMITTEE ON FIRE PREVENTION FIRE PLANNING AND FORCED HEALTH WE'VE ALSO SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN AND RESOURCES THAT -- PORTRAYED THE BUCK BUDGET FOR THOSE ISSUES -- THE FIRST GIRL I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS -- AB NINETEEN FIFTY SIX BY SOME A MEMBER LOW MOUNT -- THIS BILL CREATES [inaudible] THE YEAR ROUND FIRE PREVENTION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHAT IT DOES IS IT EXPANDS A LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A YEAR ROUND ROBUST FIRE PROVISION PREVENTION EFFORT IN THE AND THEN THE STATE. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND WHAT THEIR TIME THE LOCAL CAPACITY -- TO GIVE GRANTS TO FIRE SAFE COUNCILS RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND YOU SEE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION TO DO ON MULTI YEAR EFFORTS TO REALLY INCREASE THE LOOK THE LOCAL CAPACITY -- FOR FIRE PREVENTION AND WHEN I SAY FIRE PREVENTION I MEAN IS A FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS -- FIRE HARDENING -- EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PLANNING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES -- ADVANCE PAYMENT AUTHORITY FOR A LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS THAT CAN HELP -- COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PER TO PROVIDE THE RE -- FUNDING UP FRONT FOR THE WORK -- IN ADDITION -- THE BILL PRIORITIZES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEEMED TO DO -- SERVE ALL THE BEST PRACTICES FOR BEING A PROACTIVE ON FIRE PREVENTION. AND THE NEXT BILL IS AB TWENTY NINETY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON -- YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF FIRE UP PRESCRIBED FIRE IN US SENATOR JACKSON'S BILLS A HUGE STEP FORWARD ON THAT ISSUE. BITE OUT THIS ATTACK -- GOES AFTER ANOTHER ISSUE WHICH IS INSURANCE FOR PRIVATE PRESCRIBERS THEY HAVE TO GET INSURANCE POLICIES TO DO THEIR PRIVATE A PRESCRIBED BURN IN WITH THIS BILL WOULD DO FOR A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. IS ALLOW -- CAO FIRE -- TO DEVELOP A POOR SO THAT ALL THE PREVENT PRIVATE PRIVATE PRESCRIBE BURNERS GOOD TO GET TOGETHER AND HOPEFULLY GET A LOWER RATE FOR THEIR INSURANCE TO DO MORE PRESCRIBED FIRE. TIME AND EXPEL ARE GONNA GO OVER IS AB. TWENTY NINE ELEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN -- THIS BILL DEALS WITH A FIRE -- SMART PLANNING -- IT. IT ALSO ADVOCATES -- FOR AT A TYPE OF UTILITY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT CALLED RIGHT TREE RIGHT PLACE THIS IS THE CONCEPT -- THAT IF WE ARE TO PLANK COMPATIBLE VEGETATION BELOW UTILITY LINES THAT WOULD NOT AT ITS MATURITY GROW UP INTO THE LINES TO GET AVOID SOME -- VEGETATION MANAGEMENT COSTS -- IT ALSO. CLOSES SOME LOOPHOLES ON MAKING SURE THAT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE VERY FIRE HIGHER HIGHER FIGHT HI FI. YEAH THIS IS A TOP WE IF THE TOP BACK IN ABOUT FIVE BUT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HIGH FIRE DANGER. THAT THEY GET THE POOR PROPER ORDINANCES PASSED NOW THE PROPER RULES IN PLACE AND IN ADDITION -- IN MAKE SURE THAT THE BOARD OF FORESTRY HAS ALL THE DOCUMENTS THAT IT NEEDS IN ORDER TO AND FOR STATE LAW WE HAVE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD -- FIRE PLANNING LAWS ON THE BOOKS BUT NOT THE FULL BOARD FOR SHE DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE INFORMATION NEEDS. TO ENFORCE THOSE LAWS ON THE BILL ALSO HAS THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL -- UPDATE BUILDING STANDARDS BASED ON THE I'VE LEARNED -- AND PROVIDE A LIST OF LOW COST RETROFITS -- SO THE LIST OF LOW COST RETROFITS WILL BE HELPFUL IN THAT -- ONCE THAT LIST IS DEVELOPED -- HELLFIRE CAN -- HOW REACH TO COMMUNITIES ABOUT WHAT THOSE LOW COST RECTOR RIGHT FITS ARE AND THAT GRANTS CAN BE PROVIDED TO HELP COMMUNITIES -- IMPLEMENT THEM [inaudible] AND IN ADDITION -- THE THE BILL -- IMPROVES EVACUATION EFFORTS THERE'S A LOT OF COMMUNITIES OUT THERE THAT DON'T HAVE -- SAFE WAYS TO GET OUT OUT OF THEIR COMMUNITY WHEN THERE'S A FIRE ON AND THERE'S REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION BUT THERE'S ALREADY EXISTING COMMUNITIES THAT MAY. BE IN TROUBLE IF THERE'S A FIRE NOT BE ABLE TO EVACUATE SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IDENTIFY THOSE COMMUNITIES -- AND PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR THEM ON HOW TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN ESCAPE IF THERE'S A FIRE -- IN ADDITION -- THE BILL PROVIDES -- ACCESS FOR UTILITIES TO DO THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK THAT THEY NEED TO DO -- AND IT TAKES A SIMILAR DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT ACCESS NEEDS TO BE GIVEN OR A FINE CAN BE ISSUED -- THOUGHTS GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS THE AS A NEW BILL IT WAS JUST RECENTLY AMENDED -- A. B. THIRTY ONE SIXTY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON -- WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT CREATES A LIST OF ALL THE COMMUNITIES THAT -- ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN. TO I REDUCE FIRE RISK AND ALLOWS -- THAT LIST TO BE PUBLICIZED -- SO THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN CREATE AT THE COMPETITION AND HOPEFULLY HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DOING MORE BEST PRACTICES AND AND IT FITS TOGETHER WITH THE WOMAN BILL ON THAT ONCE THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MADE THAT LIST OF THE PRIORITIZE FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS. ON THE BILL ALSO APPROPRIATES OUT FUNDING FOR YOU SEE SCIENCE ADVISERS WHICH WERE RECOMMENDED EARLIER IN THE PANEL. AND IT EXTENDS REGULATIONS BEYOND THAT'S ARE A TO LOCAL AREAS THAT ARE AT VERY BY HIGHER. HAS RISK -- FINALLY IT UPDATES REGULATIONS -- AT THE BORDER FOR ST UNPROVED FIRE SAFETY AND HEALTH SO AS ARE THE REMAINDER OF THE BILL'S YOUR HAND OUT RUN. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WILL TURN TO MEMBERS. CERTAIN THANK YOU YES I APPRECIATE THE I THINK THIS LEADS TO ME IS THE IMPORTANT. DISCUSSION WE SHOULD BE HAVING RIGHT NOW ON THE ISSUE OF FIRES HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- PREVENTION AND SAFETY AND TO OUR OF ACTION THAT'S PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED THE SP TWELVE SIXTY I WOULD THINK PROBABLY. EACH OF YOU HAS BEEN WORKING -- ON THAT BILL IS MY STAFF. QUITE CLOSELY AND I AM VERY PLEASED WITH WHERE IT'S GOING -- I JUST WONDER -- ASSUMING THAT YOU. ARE OFF YOU WITH US -- TWELVE SIX IS THERE ANYTHING. THAT YOU BELIEVE WE MIGHT BE DOING IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S IN THERE OR SHOULD WE JUST TAKE THE BILL AS IT IS NOW IN -- YOU SAID IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT MODELED GOING FORWARD ANOTHER WHICH DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS WE MIGHT. INCLUDED AS WE WRAP UP THE THE CONTENT TO THAT BILL. YOU WON'T GET FIRED. FOR WE'RE BLESSED FROM A REMINDS ME THAT -- FIRST ALL OF THESE BILLS -- WE'RE TELLING YOU WHAT'S IN THE BILLS RIGHT NOW -- WE CAN'T PREDICT -- IF IF THE ADMINISTRATION'S GONNA RECOMMEND CHANGES WORTH APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES ARE GOING TO RECOMMEND CHANGES. SO I THINK THAT APPLIES TO WHAT I'VE SAID ABOUT ALL THESE -- I THINK -- I'M I'M WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF -- THERE ARE. I THINK THERE ARE SOME REALLY SMALL TWEAKS THAT WE'RE WE'RE CONSIDERING. NOTHING SIGNIFICANT -- AND THE ONE MAJOR QUESTION I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON AND WITH CAL FIRE ON ARE THE SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS -- FOR COASTAL POINT COMMUNITIES -- WHICH IS. TWO WERE IN THE PROCESS OF RESOLVING THAT. SO -- I THINK. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THAT BILLS CLOSE [inaudible] TO CLUSTER DOT. I WONDER IF OUR EXPERT FROM OF BERKELEY -- PROFESSOR STEVENS HAS ANY THOUGHTS. I'VE SEEN THE BILL AND PARTS OVER THAT PERIOD LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY INNOVATE I HAVE TO REALLY I DIDN'T SAY THIS IN MY COMMENTS I HAVE TO GIVE THE STATE'S A REAL CREDIT. YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS BUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW AND I'VE NEVER REALLY SEEN THE STATE CUT TO GET INTO THIS AREA FIRE FUELS RESTORATION IS MUCH. THE DELTA SEEMS LIKE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE BIG ISSUE WHEN I LOOK AT IT FROM AFAR SO I REALLY THINK THAT YOUR YOUR BILL IS REALLY FORWARD LOOKING I THINK IT TAXI VERY FOR WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU FOSTERED IN THE OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED. AS HE DID YEAH I I INITIALLY COUPLE YEARS BACK. THERE WAS SOME REAL TENSION BETWEEN AIR REGULATIONS AND THE NEED TO PUT MORE FIRE ON THE LANDSCAPE. WE IT'S NEVER AN EASY ISSUE. BUT THAT WAS ONE THING I WAS WONDERING WHAT IF WE SHOULD TRY TO DO SOMETHING IN A BILL OR CAN WE WORK THROUGH OUR EXCELLENT STAFF AND THE RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE TO SEE IF WE CAN HAVE FARTHER SITE I THINK. WATCHING THE PROGRESS CLOSELY AND NEVER LETTING GO OF THIS ISSUE KNOW THAT WE'D KEEP IT ON THE FRONT BURNER PARDON THE PUN. FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO GET US THROUGH THE NEED TO GOING TO COULD BE A GENERATION. BUT WE NEED TO STAY ON IT THAT THE AIR COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA THIS YOU MAY NOT. HAVE HEARD THIS BUT IN OREGON AND WASHINGTON THEY'RE NOT GET ALONG SO GREAT WITH THE FIRE PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO RESTORE FIRE ON THE LANDSCAPE. WE WITH THE AIRPORT HERE IN THE AIR DISTRICTS COLLABORATIVE WE'D JOINING THIS PRO FIRE PRO PRESCRIBED BURNING PARTNERSHIP. IT'S MINUTES FOUNDING WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING ECOLOGICALLY SIGNIFICANT. FIRE AND WORK ON THE LAND OVER TIME THAT'S THE TEST THINK YOU AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO ATTACK ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES BILLS SO THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO UNIFY COULD TAKE THE HEAT ON IT SO TO SPEAK. BUT CERTAINLY -- PERHAPS THE MONITORING IS SOMETHING ON ALL OF OUR BILLS YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE. EXPECTATIONS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE -- THE FIELD I HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION -- WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT HARDENING OUR HOMES. HARDENING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE -- I WONDER IF -- I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF BRINGING IN THE PACE PROGRAM. AND ADDING -- ADD TO IT -- THE ABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS. TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THOSE KINDS OF LOANS WITH THE CHICKEN AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE FOR THEIR HOMES. TO WENT TO ENCOURAGE THIS KIND OF HARDENING WHETHER IT'S I GUESS SAID DOUBLE PANE GLASS FOR EXAMPLE IS VERY HELPFUL IN. REDUCING THE HEAT THAT THAT FIRES CREATED AND BLOWING OUT WINDOWS AND LIGHTING UP TO DRAW THE DRAPES AND DESTROYING HOMES. AND NOT A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS -- ANY THOUGHTS ON WHY ON WHETHER ADDING -- THIS SAID TO THE PACE PROGRAM THE HARDENING OF OUR HOMES WOULD BE HELPFUL -- ARAB. PUT I CAN OFFERED SOME THOUGHTS AND I A VERY SMART THING TO DO -- THE THE STATE'S SYSTEM OF GRANTS. FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES -- AREN'T REALLY DESIGNED TO HELP INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS AND INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS NEED. SOME SORT OF MECHANISM. TO UNDERTAKE THESE STRUCTURAL RETROFITS TO THEIR HOUSES -- THE PACE PROGRAM AS A BASICALLY A PRIVATE SECTOR PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SELF FINANCE AND THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL HAS A LIST OF RETROFITS THAT ARE APPROVED BUT FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE. AND I THINK THAT THE PIECE PROGRAM OR A SIMILAR EFFORT IS NOT GOING TO BE NEEDED. TO CREATE A WHO A MEANINGFUL WAY FOR THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMEOWNERS ACROSS THE STATE. THAT NEED SOME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THEM TO VOLUNTARILY MAKE THESE RETROFITS THANK YOU [inaudible] MISTER DALI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIR. I WON OF JUST THE I THINK THE SENATORS ON THE RIGHT TRACK WE TALK TALKING ABOUT FIRE BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT DOWN. I LIKE TO ADDRESS ON THE FIRE ISSUES THAT. ONE OF THE THERE'S BEEN WE'VE HAD GOALS THE FOREST SERVICE HAS GOALS OF HALF A MILLION ACRES YEAR THAT THEY WANT. TO TRY [inaudible] TO BURN. AND THE BIGGEST. HURDLE IS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GO TO IMPLEMENT IT ON THE GROUND AND THERE'S A THERE'S FOR SMALL NUMBER ONE THERE'S A LIABILITY IF THE FIRE GETS AWAY FROM YOU. WHO PAYS SO THE INDUSTRIAL LAND OWNERS THAT I REPRESENT MY DISTRICT? WHO WOULD LOVE TO USE THIS AS A TOOL ARE AFRAID TO USE IT BECAUSE IF THE FIRE GETS AWAY THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THE COST OF SUPPRESSION AND SO THEY'RE RELUCTANT TO BE A? TO PUT FIRE BACK ON THE GROUND NUMBER. ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT WE HAVE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE AIRPORT WHICH THE WINDOWS OF TIMES THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE WHAT WE CALL. BURN DAY SWITZER DAYS THAT YOU ALLOW YOU TO BE ABLE TO BURN BECAUSE OF AIR QUALITY -- ARE REALLY NARROW BECAUSE WE VSP PERFECT BASICALLY FOR YOU TO BE ABLE. TO MEET AIR QUALITY STANDARDS AND APPLY THE FIRE TO THE GROUND. AND SO THOSE ARE TWO HURDLES THAT WILL BE FACED IN ANY PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO INTRODUCE FIRE -- BACK IN OUR ECOSYSTEM AND THEN I HAVE ONE MORE COMMENT SO. BEEF AND BEFORE WE INTRODUCE FIRE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. MANAGING THE FUEL LOAD BEFORE WE PUT FIRE BACK INTO IT OR WE JUST TALK ABOUT PUTTING FIRE INTO IT BEFORE WE'VE SAID AND OR DONE ME SOME SORT OF THE MANAGEMENT BE SO WE DON'T HAVE SUCH THE INTENSITY OF FIRE. I GREW UP I CAN MAKE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT ALL THESE -- YOUR IDEA OF KIND ABOUT THE LIABILITY IN THE CHALLENGES OF PLAYING FIRE ON THE GROUND IT'S VERY VERY REAL. IN ON THIS IS AGAIN WHERE I THINK WE CAN LOOK TO OUR COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. BECAUSE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA THEY'VE ENACTED SOME LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS IF YOU HAVE A PRESCRIBED FIRE PLAN HAS BEEN WRITTEN. HE GETS PEER REVIEWED BY THE RIGHT PEOPLE FEEDBACK IS APPLIED. AND THEN IT'S ACTUALLY ACCEPTED. THEN IF THE PRESCRIBED BURNING TEAM GOES OUT AND ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTS THE FIRE AS PLANNED. WITH EVERYTHING IS. TIGHT AS POSSIBLE AND THEN THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WHICH INEVITABLY YOU WILL. I GUARANTEE IT I'VE HAD PROBLEMS AND I'VE BEEN PRESCRIBED FIRES I'VE BEEN PROBABLY HUNDRED MY CAREER. AND I HAD PROBLEMS SO THE LEGISLATION IN FLORIDA THAN SAYS THEM THERE ACTUALLY IS. LIABILITY REFORM FOR THE PEOPLE DOING THE WORK. SO THERE'S NOT ON THEIR BACK IS ACTUALLY THE STATE ACTUALLY FUND THE LIABILITY PROCESS THAT IF THE THING HAS BEEN. PROBABLY PLAN IMPLEMENTED YOU HAVEN'T DONE SOMETHING FOOLISH CYCLE WHETHER SAYS THIS THE WEATHER'S BAD I DO IT ANYWAY. THEN YOU DON'T GET COVERAGE BUT IF YOU DO IT PROPERLY IN STATE OF FLORIDA'S BUDGET BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTY YEARS. AND IT REALLY HAS WORKED THE QUESTION ABOUT YOU NO BURNING IN THINNING AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE INTERESTING ONE AND ALSO I THINK FOR ME. YOU KNOW IT DEPENDS ON THE SIDE OF COURSE WHICH JUST YOU COULD DO SOME MECHANICAL WORK FIRST YOU CAN DO SOMETHING TO GET FIRED BACK THERE OTHER PLACES CORSET YOU COULD MAYBE PUT FIRE AND AT FIRST AND ACT TOGETHER. YOU WORK AS LITTLE RISK YOUR YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE AS EASILY OUTCOME YOU'RE NOT GONNA BUILD A PRESCRIBED EXACTLY AS TIGHTLY WHAT THE OUTCOME MIGHT BE INTERESTING WERE TALLY. A BLODGETT FORCE WHICH I MENTIONED WE'VE DONE PRESCRIBED FIRES IN THE SAME GROUND OFFER THREE TIMES IN TWENTY YEARS. AND WE'VE ALSO DONE MECHANICAL THINNING BUT NO FIRE. AND YOU CAN GO IN THERE AND YOU'RE OUR DIFFERENCES YOU KNOW THE THE FIRESIDE IS JUST A MORE RANDOM -- MORTALITY PATCHES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT. A PROBLEM IN THE SCALE IS SO LARGE IN THE STATE I THINK YOU TAKE ALL OF THE TREATMENTS THAT ARE POSSIBLE. AND YOU APPLY THEM AND YOU LET THE MANAGERS ON THE CHOICE SO I THINK ALL THOSE ARE VIABLE AND I FOR ME THE MECHANICAL SIDE. IN MY VIEW SOMETIMES PUBLIC DOESN'T GET DISCUSSED ENOUGH YOU KNOW AND I IF WE GO TO BLODGETT WE CAN LOOK AT PLACES THAT I'VE BEEN THIN TWICE. AND WE CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THE OUTCOMES OF THAT AND YES YOU CAN DO SOME WORK IS NOT A COMPLETE CIRCUIT FOR FIRE BUT IT CAN ACTUALLY WORK AS WELL. SO MY VIEW IS THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN TRIED AND TESTED AND IT REALLY DEPENDS AND I HAD TO TAKE ONE OF THE METHODS OFF THE TABLE. A PRIORI AND THEN SAY WE'RE ALL GOING TO USE THIS ARE ONLY GOING TO USE THAT I FEEL THAT STEP BY STEP [inaudible] BACKWARDS -- SO I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE THINGS ONE THE HALF MILLION ACRE IDEA COMES FROM A MALCOLM NORTH PAPER FROM. NINE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THAT LOOKS AT THE DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED FIRE REGIME SO THAT HE DIDN'T PULL IT OUT OF THIN AIR WHAT'S. THAT IS THE FUEL AND FIRE DEBT WE LIVE WITH EVERY YEAR IN THIS HERE IN OUR OWN BROWN IN THIS HEARING ABOUT. EVERY YEAR. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THOSE ACRES ARE NOT. ABSOLUTELY UNREACHABLE BY MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT. SO THEN WE ARE ALSO FACED WITH WHAT THE HECK DO WE DO IT. AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF THOSE ACRES ARE IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE WE CAN ESTABLISH EITHER A NATURAL IGNITION USE IT FOR BENEFIT WHEN ALL THE CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT. ALL THE CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT. OR WE CAN USE FIRE THEIR PRO ACTIVELY AND ACCEPT THE LOW IN NYC SEVERITY RESULT WHICH WAS THE NATURAL SYSTEM [inaudible] FOR CENTURIES SO THERE'S THERE'S CERTAINLY ISSUES WITH THAT LEVEL OF ACREAGE ARE WE STAFFED UP TO DO IT DO WE GET THE AIR DAYS TO DO IT. WE GET A LOT OF AIR DAYS IN CALIFORNIA WE OFTEN DON'T WE GET THEM SOMETIMES WHEN WE'RE YET TRAINING LEARNING HOW TO PUT THE FIRE OUT WHEN WE COULD BE OUT BURNING. HOW WE GET THERE ARE DAYS WHEN THE FUELS ARE WAY TOO WET TO EVER LIVE WITH A BLOWTORCH? SO THAT THAT IS PART OF OUR FIRE AND WHEN YOU PARTNERSHIP IN WORKING TOGETHER TO HOW DO WE ADDRESS THESE DIFFERENT BARRIERS. AND THE NEAT THING IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE ARE. VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE IS A VERY ASTUTE AIR QUALITY COMMUNITY. THAT IS SAYING WE HAVE TO DO MORE THERE'S ONLY TWO CHOICES EMISSIONS THAT ARE REALLY HARMFUL TO PUBLIC HEALTH. AND EMISSIONS WHERE WE HAVE SOME SAY IN THE DISPERSION OF THOSE THAT SMOKE FACT NOT LIKE WHAT WE'RE SEEING LATELY. BUT WHEN WE HAVE THAT PLANNED OPPORTUNITY WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER WITH FIRE SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE WORK ON DAY AND NIGHT IN THIS PARTNERSHIP OKAY. FOLLOW OKAY UM MISTER WOODS. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THEIR PRESENTATIONS I THINK GO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- IS MISSING FROM. THIS BILL PACKAGE SURE THESE PACKED NOT. BUT THIS GROUPING OF BILLS. IS A REAL LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO FUNDING QUITE FRANKLY WE HEARD FROM THE PROFESSOR HERE ABOUT. THIS THERE'S A LOT OUT THERE IS GOING TO TAKE TIME AND YOU KNOW I DON'T WANNA GO BACK TOO FAR IN TIME BUT MY MY RITUAL BILL TWENTY FIVE FIFTY ONE ACTUALLY CALLED -- FOR SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES ON AN ONGOING BASIS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PLUS MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. A NOT FOR ST THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT VERY FAR WE GOT DOWN WE'RE DOWN TO ONE TIME FUNDING SO I DON'T SEE HOW WE ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE NEED TO IN CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT A LONG TERM SUSTAINED OF INVESTMENT IN THESE ACTIVITIES AND SO. AS I'M LOOKING AT AT STAFF THERE THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. I AYE PERSON WILL BE LOOKING. TO TO TO ADDRESS BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW WE DO IT WITH JUST THE GOVERNOR'S TO UNDER FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS PLUS SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS. WE NEED SOMETHING ON A LONG TERM BASIS. JUST A QUICK COMMENT -- OBVIOUSLY I AGREE -- DO WE HAVE TO GET. SUPPORT FOR THAT -- WHETHER WHETHER IT'S ENOUGH POLICY BUILT IN THE BUDGET -- WHICH HAS BEEN ELUSIVE. BUT WE HAVE TOGETHER AND I THINK THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT COROLLARY POINT HERE IS. IS THE GRANTS THAT ARE GOING OUT -- TO LANDOWNERS AND NGOS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND EVERYBODY ELSE -- REQUIRE. A LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO THE LAND. AND THAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT NOT JUST LONG TERM FUNDING. BUT LONG TERM MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES I MEAN THESE THESE GRANTS SHOULD NOT JUST BE ONE AND DONE. IS THIS THINGS I MEAN THERE NEEDS TO BE A LONG TERM MANAGEMENT STRATEGY TO MANAGE THOSE LANDS FOR CLIMATE AND FIRE AND WHAT. KINDS OF SPECIES WE WANT TO SEE ON THE LANDSCAPE -- THOSE SHOULD ALL BE CONDITIONS OF THESE GRANTS [inaudible] SENATE CANNELLA. OKAY. BOTH OF THANK YOU I APPRECIATE. ALL OF YOU AND YOUR OUTSIDE. PERSPECTIVE ON THIS MORE THAN LIKELY TAKE YOU UP ON YOUR OFFER TO CIRCLE BACK TO CALL CIRCLE BACK. OUT NOW TURN THE NEXT PANEL OVER TO SENATOR DODD. OKAY WE HAVE NOW FUNDING FOR THE FIRE PREVENTION HEALTHY FOUR SEGMENT -- THE PANEL HERE WE'VE GOT JIM BRAND HIM BY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY CAMP HIM WHAT DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. ALSO JOHN LAYERED SECRETARY NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AND ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES -- EACH. AS I RECALL BEING JOHN LEGISLATURE WE COULDN'T SNEEZE IN FIVE MINUTES -- MISTER CHAIR I'M GONNA TAKE THE LIBERTY OF GOING FIRST IN TRYING TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW AND THEN LEAD INTO THE REST -- BECAUSE THIS SECTION OF YOUR GENDER IS TITLED FUNDING FOR FIRE PREVENTION AND HEALTHY FORESTS AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY THE OVERVIEW AND TURN IT OVER TO DIRECTOR PAM WHAT. FOR THE FIRE GRANTS AND THEN TO JIM BRANHAM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY. WHO'LL PROVIDE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF THEIR FUELS REDUCTION PROGRAM. HOW WE'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THIS FROM THE FIRST DAYS OF OUR TIME HERE? AND WHEN WE WALKED IN THE DOOR THERE WERE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OF CHOICES TO EXCLUDE FIRE FROM THE LANDSCAPE AND ALLOW WILD FIRE FUEL TO ACCUMULATE. OF FIRE IN THE STATE IS NON NEGOTIABLE IT'S PART OF OUR ECOSYSTEM AND EITHER WE MANAGE OUR FORCE FOR LOW INTENSITY FIRE. OR WE EXPERIENCE LARGER AND LARGER FIRES. WILDFIRE THREAT IS A COMBINATION OF THREE FACTORS. FUEL TEMPERATURE AND WIND AND IGNITION. AS OUR CLIMATE WARMS TO FUEL CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND AND INCREASING WARM SPELLS GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR FIRE. AND AS OUR STATE'S POPULATION GROWS THE IGNITION OPPORTUNITIES GROW. ON AVERAGE 95% OF FIRES IN CALIFORNIA ARE CAUSED BY SOME FORM OF HUMAN ACTIVITY. WE SEE EVIDENCE OF THESE CHANGING FACTORS IN THE LENGTH OF THE FIRE SEIZE. OVER THE PAST GENERATION OUR FIRE SEASON HAS GROWN AT THE FRONT END BY ROUGHLY THIRTY DAYS AND AT THE BACK AND HAS EXTENDED BY ROUGHLY THIRTY DATES. WE RECOMMENDED TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED LAST YEAR A CHANGE IN OUR FIRE BUDGETING SYSTEM THAT RECOGNIZES THIS CHANGE. IT'S IT RECOGNIZES A BASE BUDGETING THAT WAS BASED ON WHAT IS NOW OUR FIRE SEASON NOT ON WHAT USED TO BE OUR FIRE SEASON. AND AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE THE GOVERNOR HAD ON OUR CURRENT FIRE SITUATION THE WEEK BEFORE LAST. DIRECTOR PAM WHAT STATED THAT HIS DEPARTMENT USED TO EXPERIENCE ONE BIG FIRE OF NINETY THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR. WE HAVE HAD FIVE SUCH FIRES THUS FAR THIS YEAR INCLUDING THE BIGGEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. AND WE'RE BUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE FIRE SEASON. THESE FIRES OF LED TO DEVASTATING IMPACTS TO LIFE PROPERTY IN ECOSYSTEMS. ARE AND IT DOES ALSO HAVE LARGER IMPACTS TO THOSE OF US THAT MIGHT NOT LIVE EXACTLY IN THE FIRE ZONE. WHETHER IT'S SMOKE IN THE AIR WE BREATHE OR ECONOMIC IMPACTS SUCH AS WIPING OUT WEEKS OF PETE TOURISM. AND YOU SOMEBODY PARK THIS YEAR AND IN THE NAPA VALLEY IN BIG SUR COAST IN RECENT YEARS. IN MAY THE GOVERNOR TOOK MAJOR STEPS TO INCREASE OUR RESPONSE TO FIRE PREVENTION. BY ISSUING AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WITH FIRE PREVENTION ACTIONS. APPROVING A FORCE CARBON PLAN IS A ROADMAP. INCREASING BUDGET ALLOCATIONS FOR FIRE GRANTS AND FIRE PREVENTION AND APPOINTING A GOVERNOR'S OFFICE POINT PERSON TO LEAD ON THESE ISSUES. OF THE LEGISLATURE FOLLOWED SUIT BY APPROVING OF MOST OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS IN JAIL ALL TALK ABOUT HIM IN A MINUTE. BUT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WERE SOME ACTIONS TAKEN AND PRECEDING YEARS -- ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS NEGOTIATED. A A. B. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO TO FINALLY GET SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR TIMBER REGULATION SO THAT THAT WOULD MOVE. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WE FACED WRECK. STATE THAT LED TO WORK ACROSS. FATE THE STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PUT FORTH A PLAN OF ACTION. WE WORKED WITH YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE SUCCESSFULLY FUND THOSE PRIORITIES OVER MULTIPLE YEARS. AND WHEN WE STARTED THE ADMINISTRATION HAD IT DE IN THE STATE OUT OF TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. THAT MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT AND THEN WHEN THE STATE RECOVERED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN IN TO BUDGET SEQUESTRATION. OF THAT THEN HAMPERED FEDERAL EFFORTS IN THE FORESTS. AND CONGRESS FINALLY -- DEALT WITH THE ISSUE THAT FEDERAL FIREFIGHTING COSTS EAT UP MANY FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT COULD HAVE GONE TO FORCE HEALTH. BUT THAT SOLUTION DOES NOT BEGIN UNTIL SEPTEMBER. TWENTY NINETEEN AS A RESULT THE STATE ENTERED INTO GOOD NEIGHBOR AGREEMENTS THAT ALLOW FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO WORK ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL LINES. TO DEAL WITH VARIOUS FORCED AND FIRE SITUATIONS. WE'RE ALSO LEADING THE NATION. IN FIRE AND TEMPERATURE FORECASTING SCIENCE A FOURTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT WILL BE WHICH WILL BE RELEASED LATER THIS MONTH WILL SHOW THAT WERE PRODUCING NEW SCIENCE AND LEADING GLOBAL WAY IN THAT FIELD. THE TWO THINGS I WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT IT BRIEFLY AS I CAN IN THE REMAINING TIME. IS THE FORCE CARBON PLAN WHICH IS THE PRODUCT OF STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCY WORK ON FORESTRY. BY AGENCIES WHO DON'T ALWAYS SEE EYE TO EYE. ACTUALLY CAME TOGETHER AROUND CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS THE PLAN COVERS ALL FORCE DID REGIONS IN THE STATE. EMPHASIZES THE NEED TO TAKE RETURN ON WATERSHED BASED ACTION AND INCLUDE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE FUELS REDUCTION. A TO PREVENT HIGH INTENSITY FIRE CENTERING STRATEGIES AROUND REGION'S -- PROTECTING FORCED LANDING GUARANTEEING LOWER INTENSITY FORESTRY PRACTICES TO EASEMENTS ACQUISITIONS IN LAND USE PLANNING. BUILDING NEW AND MODERN ECONOMIES AROUND WHAT PRODUCTS SO THAT WE CAN. USE REMOVE SMALL TREES AND OTHER FUELS. OF RATHER THAN BURNING THEM. THE RECENTLY ENACTED BUDGET HAS ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO PUT TO REST. A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION FOR FOREST HEALTH GRANT SIXTY THREE MILLION FOR FUELS REDUCTION. THIRTY MILLION FOR FORCED TREATMENT IN THE SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY. OF TWENTY NINE A MILLION AND PERMANENT FUNDING FOR SIX PRESCRIBED BURNING AND FUELS REDUCTION CRUZ. TWENTY TWO MILLION TO LOCAL AGENCIES AND NON PROFITS LEADING WORK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FIFTEEN MILLION FOR PROTECTING US FORCES STATE PARKS. TWO POINT TWO MILLION FOR WHAT PRODUCT MARKET INNOVATION AND ACCELERATION. A BUILDING ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF OUR S. B. EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHAT PRODUCTS WORKING GROUP. FROM THIS FUNDING GRANT SIR -- GOING OUT LOCALLY THAT THE DIRECTOR WILL TALK ABOUT. THE OTHER THING IS THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS ISSUED. AND IT DOUBLES FROM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES A TREATED PER YEAR WITH REGARD TO FIRE. TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AND IN YOUR PREVIOUS PANEL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES WAS MENTIONED. THAT'S IN FEDERAL FORCE AND WE HOPE THEY CAN HOLD TO THAT WE CAN HOLD TO THIS THAT'S ONE MILLION TOGETHER -- THAT WOULD BE TREATED. OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ALSO AND CALLS FOR IMPROVING REGULATORY PROCESS REDUCING LIABILITY FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE. INCREASE WHAT PRODUCT MARKETING. AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL AREAS WHERE THE WORK IS DONE. AND OUT OF THIS WAS CREATED A FOREST MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE LED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ARE AGENCIES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. OF THAT TASK FORCE WILL HAVE -- EXTENSIVE -- TASKS WITH REGARD TO THIS IT MET JUST YESTERDAY AND IT IS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT AND GET EVERYBODY AROUND THE TABLE TO MOVE AHEAD ON THIS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. SO AMOUNT TURN IT OVER TO CHEAT. THANK YOU SECRETARY LEARNING GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AGAIN CAN TEN LOT AT DIRECTOR OF CAL FIRE. SO YES AS I SAID BEFORE YOU TODAY OBVIOUSLY WE ARE IN AGAIN ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING AND DESTRUCTIVE FIRE SEASONS AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE SAY THAT -- EVERY YEAR AND EVERY YEAR WE COME BACK AND AN INCREASE -- THE DESTRUCTIVE AND SIGNIFICANT NATURE OF FIRE SEASON -- OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF STATE AND PRIVATE LAND HAS BURNED IN CALIFORNIA SINCE JULY PURSUE ME JANUARY FIRST -- WE HAVE OVER FOUR THOUSAND FIRES HAVE BURNED SINCE JANUARY FIRST -- WE HAVE EXPENDED OVER THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE'S EMERGENCY FUND COMBATING THESE FIRES. AGAIN THE CHALLENGE CONTINUES AGAIN JUST LAST NIGHT ON THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX THE RANCH FIRE AND AS SECRETARY LAIRD SAID WHICH IS NOW THE LARGEST FIRE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. A FIREFIGHTER FROM THE STATE OF UTAH -- PERISHED COMBATING THAT BLAZE SO THE RISKS ARE REAL THE CHALLENGES ARE REAL. WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT THE FIRE SUPPRESSION EFFORT ITS KEY OBVIOUSLY THE RESPONSE BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE. TO THIS ARE SO MUCH MORE TO CAL FIRES ROLE AND OUR ROOM WAS THE STATE AND FIRE PREVENTION AND WHAT WE DO -- HELLFIRE IS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS COMBINE FOR A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH INCLUDING FORCED AND VEGETATION TREATMENTS WILDLAND FIRE PRE ENGINEERING LAND USE PLANNING EDUCATION. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CIVIL COST RECOVERY ALL OF THESE. ARE AIMED AT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF FIRE STARTS YOU HEARD SECRETARY LAIRD SAY 95% OF FIRES IN THE STATE ARE HUMAN CAUSED SO. FIRE PREVENTION FOCUSES ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF STARTS TO BEGIN WITH. CREATING MORE FIRE RESISTANT AND DEFENDABLE. COMMUNITIES AND REDUCING THE OVERALL INTENSITY OF WILDFIRE THROUGH THE VARIOUS FUEL AND VEGETATION TREATMENTS THAT ARE YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT TODAY. WE WORK ON FOR STANDING PRESCRIBED FIRE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS -- VARIOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT CIVIL COST RECOVERY ARE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF EVERY FIRE. AND THEN PURSUING WHERE THAT NEIGHBOR THERE MAYBE NEGLIGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES AGAIN ARE ABOUT REDUCING. THE NUMBER OF FIRE STARTS AND THE INTENSITY. OUR FOCUS IS THROUGH EDUCATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PREVENT THE FIRES FROM STARTING OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN HELLFIRE IS CONDUCTED OVER ONE MILLION DEFENSIBLE SPACE. INSPECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE RESPONSIBILITIES. A SECRETARY LAIRD SAID OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES ON AVERAGE ANNUALLY ARE TREATED THROUGH A VARIETY OF PROCESSES. SCRIBE FIRE FOR STANDING FUEL BREAKS I UTILITY CLEARANCES ALL OF THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOUBLING THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S INITIATIVES. HELLFIRE IS A PART OF THE PRESCRIBED FIRE IN THE YOU THAT YOU HEARD -- TALKED ABOUT HERE EARLIER WE ALSO HAVE -- ANIMAL YOU DEMO YOU -- SINCE LAST AUGUST WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO WORK ARE ON A NUMBER OF ASPECTS BUT IN PARTICULAR SUPPORTING THE U. THE COMMISSION'S WORK WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS. AS PART OF SENATE BILL TEN TWENTY EIGHT PROVIDING THE SUPPORT FOR THE MAPPING AND ENGAGING IN THAT EFFORT. WE ARE LOOKING TOWARDS A A MULTI AGENCY UPDATE OF THE POWER LINE FIRE PREVENTION FIELD GUIDE THESE THE VERY. GUIDANCE THAT'S PROVIDED THAT HELPS INTERPRET THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE IN TERMS OF WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE FOR UTILITIES CLEARANCE AROUND THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT GRANTS AND FIRE PREVENTION AND FORCED HEALTH GRANTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN HELLFIRE IS APPROVED FOUR HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN GRANTS. TOTALING NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR FIRE PREVENTION FORCED HEALTH. TREE MORTALITY. TO STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN PARTICULAR AREAS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES AND AREAS IMPACTED BY TREE MORTALITY I BELIEVE THE A STAFF HAS HANDED OUT -- SOME HANDOUTS THAT TO PROVIDE A LISTING OF ALL THE GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED. BUT THE THE GRANTS REALLY FALL INTO CATEGORIES FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION. FOREST HEALTH LOOK AT THE BROADER. ASPECTS WE EMPHASIZE LANDSCAPE LOW MULTIPLE BENEFITS SUCH AS CARBON SEQUESTRATION FIRE RESILIENCE WATER QUALITY PEST RESILIENCE WILDLIFE HABITAT. ALSO BROUGHT BROADER COMMUNITY BENEFITS FROM THESE BROADER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGED PROJECTS AND ALSO. PERMITS WE WANT PROJECTS THAT AREN'T ONE TIME WE WANT PROJECTS THAT ARE ONGOING AND PERMANENT FIXTURES WITHIN THESE WATERSHEDS. FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS FOCUSED MORE SPECIFICALLY ON PROTECTION OF HABITABLE STRUCTURES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY FOCUS ON IN OF THE GREATER NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES AND PROTECTION OF PEOPLE -- AND CERTAINLY NEED BROADER COMMUNITY SUPPORT -- SEVERAL EXAMPLES AND YOU'RE GONNA HERE'S BOB IS A VERY SPECIFICALLY FROM JIM BROWN I'M ON A VERY A GOOD PROJECT -- BUT THERE'S OTHER PROJECTS OUT THERE TO SOME FOR EXAMPLE THE CRAGGY VEGETATION PROJECT. IN SISKIYOU COUNTY. WORKING THROUGH THE GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY WHICH ALLOWS US TO WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS ACROSS BOUNDARIES TREATING OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND ACRES THROUGH FUELS REDUCTION. INVENTING. THE MY SIERRA WOODS PROJECT SPONSORED BY THE AMERICAN FOREST FOUNDATION IT'S LOOKING AT NINE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR YOUR COUNTIES WITH OF THE REACHING OUT -- TO NON INDUSTRIAL PRIVATE FOREST LANDOWNERS TO ENGAGE THEM WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY TO WORK ON THEIR LANDS ANTICIPATE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY PROJECTS. TREATING FORTY TWO THOUSAND ACRES USING WOOD PRODUCTS MARKETS TO OFFSET COSTS HOOTING BIOMASS LUMBER AND OTHER VARIOUS FOR ITS PRODUCTS. THESE PROJECTS WORK. JUST WITHIN THE LAST TWO WEEKS THE CRANSTON FIRE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY VERY SIGNIFICANT FUEL BREAK PROJECT BELOW THE COMMUNITY OF IDYLLWILD USING A VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDING STATE FUNDS. THAT FUEL BREAK WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING STEER THAT FIRE AWAY FROM THE MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES INCLUDING IDYLLWILD. AGAIN IT GAVE FIREFIGHTERS A FIGHTING CHANCE STEER THAT FIRE REDUCED FUEL LOADING DOES THE KIND OF PROJECTS WE ARE WORKING ON STATEWIDE AND WE NEED TO INCREASE. OUR INVESTMENT IN THESE PROJECTS STATE WIDE. PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. SO AGAIN INCREASING PACE AND SCALE INCREASING THE USE OF THE GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY WE CURRENTLY HAVE. FIVE GOOD NEIGHBORS SORTIE PROJECTS -- WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AROUND THE STATE AGAIN CROSS BOUNDARY WORK BOTH OF RESOURCES IN FUNDING. THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THOSE AGREEMENTS. WE ARE LOOKING AT REDUCING BARRIERS TO ENTER -- FOR STANDS FOR FOR STEALTH AND FUELS REDUCTION THAT INCLUDES. ARE INCREASING OUR ABILITY FOR FOREST INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAPACITY OF MILLS AND BIOMASS FACILITIES ALL OF THAT TO HELP PROCESS THE MATERIAL COMING OUT OF THE WOODS. WE NEED CAL FIRE NEWS TO CONTINUE TO WRAP UP OUR OWN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND AS YOU HEARD WE THROUGH SOME OF THE LEGISLATION. AND HAVE A REAL EMPHASIS ON PARTNERING WITH OTHER PRESCRIBED BURNERS SO THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE ALL OF OUR EXPERTISE TO INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE. THAT ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. HELLFIRE HAS RECENTLY RE ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY AS THE STATE WHITE COORDINATOR FOR THE NATIONAL FIRE WEIS COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. SINCE TAKING OVER THE PROGRAM CAL FIRE HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF NEW FIRE WEIS COMMUNITY STATEWIDE. ADJUST THIS YEAR A WE'VE DESIGNATED A RECORD NUMBER OF US ADDING SIXTEEN AT NEW COMMUNITIES FOR A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR FIRE WEISS COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN THIS IS. CRITICALLY PART OF THE OUTREACH WERE DOING. SO IN CONCLUSION REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT HE SHARED WITH YOU IN A LETTER. UP IN IN JULY AND IT'S REALLY WORKING AGAIN WITH -- THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION STAKEHOLDERS. TO STRENGTHENED ENHANCE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR INTERESTS AB AND PROTECTION OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE WILD LANDS WORKING ON THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS [inaudible] ALL THIS IS YOUR MARK TOWARDS REDUCING. A NUMBER STARTS IN THE WILD LAND. REJECTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN FIRES DO OCCUR YOU CHIEF. THANK YOU AFTERNOON JIM BRANDS HERE THAT A CONSERVANCY -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GROUND COVERED IN THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS I TRY NOT TO BE REDUNDANT HERE -- MONEY START UP THERE THIS YEAR NEVADA CONSERVANCY IS ONE OF THE STATE'S. TEN CONSERVANCY'S -- WE REPRESENT ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE STATE OBVIOUSLY SERIES IF HE TO CALIFORNIA IN MANY WAYS AS ITS PRIMARY WATERSHED RESTORE HALF THE STATE'S POOREST CARBON. RECREATION AND SO ON SO AS WE THINK ABOUT CARRYING OUT OUR MISSION IN THAT REGION WERE ALWAYS. I'M COGNIZANT OF OF HOW WE HELP ACHIEVE STATEWIDE OBJECTIVES AND THAT'S A RULE THAT A REGIONAL CONSERVANCY CAN PLAY -- AS WE ARE WE'VE BEEN AROUND THIRTEEN YEARS AND AS WE GET BETTER PROGRAM ON THE GROUND IT BECAME INCREASINGLY CLEAR TO US THAT THAT REALLY ARE PROGRAM CENTERED ON THE IDEA CREATING HEALTHY WATERSHEDS. HEALTHY FOREST HEALTHY COMMUNITIES THEY WERE INTERLINKED -- AND WE WERE WORKING OUR WAY THROUGH THAT AND ALONG CAME TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THE RIM FIRE. AND THE RIMFIRE WAS WAS TRULY A GAME CHANGER I THINK FOR MANY OF US LARGEST FIRE THE RECORDED HISTORY OF THE SIERRA NEVADA -- IT BURNED AT SEVERITY IS THAT THERE'S NO HISTORICAL RECORD FOR PATCHES OF HIGH SEVERIT FIRE THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN. AND IT WAS I THINK A WAKE UP CALL TO SAY THIS ISN'T NORMAL THIS IS NATURAL WHAT'S GOING ON UNFORTUNATELY EVERY YEAR SINCE THEN WE CAN POINT TO SOMEWHERE IN THE STATE. WE'VE HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE AND AND IT'S ALWAYS YOU IS YOU DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ANY BEGIN TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT THE ONE THING IF YOU KEEP COMING BACK. TO HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT A LOT WHICH OF THE FUEL AND WHETHER THE FUEL AT THAT STE CALIFORNIAN ONE FORMER ANOTHER AT 60% OF THE STATE IS COVERED BY -- WOODY MATERIAL WHETHER THEIR TREES ARE BRUSH WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE AT SOME POINT EVERY YEAR I THINK THAT YOU CAN BACK ME UP ON THIS THEY BECOME FLAMMABLE. AND AND THE FUEL LOADS ARE A COMMON DENOMINATOR SO REALLY FOCUSING ON THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ADDRESS. YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE ISSUES THE LONG TERM WEATHER TOPOGRAPHY THOSE AND IGNITIONS WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH CONTROL OVER. SO WE BEGAN TO WORK WITH BUT A NUMBER OF OUR PARTNERS -- YOU'RE AT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY IT'S NOT WORKING WE FORM THE SIERRA NEVADA WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM -- OUR PRIMARY PART AT THE TIME WAS U. S. FOR SERVICE BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE REACHED OUT TO OUR THEIR STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCY PARTNERS. WE HAVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY INDUSTRY LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN EVERYBODY IN BETWEEN. WE STARTED KIND OF SIMPLE PREMISE WHAT COULD WE AGREE UPON. AND WE'VE GOT QUICKLY DID AGREEMENT THAT NOBODY WAS TOO HAPPY WITH THE PATH WE RUN SO WE BEGAN EXPLORING HOW WE BUILD UPON AGREEMENTS. AND COME UP WITH A PROGRAM ACROSS THE REGION THAT'S GOOD OR ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. WE ALSO CAME PRETTY QUICKLY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT -- TREAT TREATMENTS WORK. AND THERE'S REALLY NOT A BUDGET TOOLS IN THAT TO A BOXER'S PRESCRIBE TO MANAGE FIRED YOU FOR TALK ABOUT AND THERE'S MECHANICAL TREATMENTS WHETHER THEY BE THINNING OR SUSTAINABLE HARVEST -- THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR OUR GATE AND SO FIGURING OUT HOW TO PUT THAT OUT ANY PACE AND SCALE THAT'S GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAME -- OUR CHALLENGE UNDER THE WATERSHED APPROVED PROGRAM BUT THE OTHER THING WE WERE NOTICING AS WE MET WITH FIRE OFFICIALS AND SCIENTISTS AND SO ON IS -- EVERY TIME WE THOUGHT WE'D. FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO US. REALITY KEPT LEAPFROGGING. WE KEPT GETTING WORSE AND WAITED MANY BRIEFINGS AFTER THE RIM FIRE KING FIRE AND SO ON WITH. THE FIRE PEOPLE CENTER MODELS COULDN'T PREDICT THIS BEHAVIOR AND I THINK THAT I GET IS ONLY GETTING WORSE FOR US SO. SO WE REALLY LOOKED AT HOW DO YOU WOULD YOU WOULD YOU DO ABOUT THIS AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. FROM THAT EFFORT IS THERE REALLY ARE THREE THERE'S THREE PRETTY SIMPLE -- THINGS WE NEED TO ADDRESS ONE IS INVESTMENT A LOT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT THAT HAVING A STABLE LONG TERM SOURCE OF FUNDING ALLOWS YOU TO BUILD PROGRAMS. OVER TIME TO GET TO THE PACE AND SCALE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL STRUGGLE WITH HIS -- WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT KIND OF STABILITY. HOWEVER WE GOT A LOT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM NOW IS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED A LOT OF FUNDING THAT IS SHOWING UP ON THE SCENE. THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS NOW WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE DO STRATEGIC HACKLEY SMART ABOUT SPENDING THAT AND HOW DO WE ACTUALLY MOVE LANDSCAPES TO A TO A STATE OF RESILIENCE. AND AND I WOULD SAY FOR FROM A LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE. THINKING THROUGH HOW YOU ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS INAPPROPRIATE THEM AND YOU KNOW SOMEBODY THINK IT'S IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS. NOT MAKING THE TO TO PRESCRIPTIVE NOT TARGETING ONE LANDSCAPE OVER ANOTHER WE TRY TO LOOK AT THIS YEAR NEVADA MAPPING WE TRIED BUT THE THAT COLORBLIND GLASSES ON RIGHT. I DON'T CARE IF IT'S GREEN OR YELLOW OR WHITE OR WHATEVER THE OWNERSHIP AS IN THERE IS HOW DO WE ADDRESS AT A LANDSCAPE SCALE SO AGAIN LET'S. HOPE WE CAN BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW WE GET PUT THOSE FUNDS OUT THERE SO WE CAN DESTROY TEACHER COULD AWAY THAT. ACTUALLY MOVE LANDSCAPES TO POINT A RESILIENCE -- THE OTHER THE SECOND THEY WE FOCUSED ON WAS POLICY AND PROCESS INTO -- AND THERE'S A LOT OF NEW WERE THE AIR QUALITY DISCUSSION AND AND AND USING A FIRE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS AND STILL HAVE SOME WAYS TO GO. BUT I THINK WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS WITH. WITH AIR REGULATORS WHO ARE REALIZING. WHAT WE'RE DOING OUT THERE ISN'T WORKING SO WELL SO? CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO DO THAT WE HAVE A PROJECT IN THE CENTRAL SIERRA. THE TONGS INTERESTS HERE INITIATIVE WHERE WE WERE REALLY TESTING NEW WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS AND AND CARRY OUT THE PROCESS ONE OF THE PROJECTS THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. THE NGOS ACTUALLY HIRED IN HIS OVERSEEING THE WORK OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANTS. WHO PRODUCED THE OF OUR MIDDLE DOCUMENTS AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE LOCAL AGENCY IN THIS CASE WILL APPROVE IT'S A? DIFFERENT WAY TO GO ABOUT IT BUT IT'S CREATING SOME CAPACITY THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BE THERE SO. REALLY. LOOKING AT PROCESSES ONE I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU MAY BE OFFERING IT AS A QUESTION SINCE I AM BUT I WANT TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF MY SECRETARY HERE -- BUT AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MAKES THE DECISION TO INVEST ON PROJECTS ON FEDERAL LAND THAT HEAVY CLEAR BENEFIT TO THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. PROJECTS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS DOES IT REALLY MAKE SENSE AS A FUNDING AGENCY FOR US TO HAVE TO START OVER IN GO THROUGH THE SECRET PROCESS ON TOP OF THAT. TO DO IT TWICE. MANY OF US THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD REALLY BE ASKING OURSELVES AT THEIR SUMMIT PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE CAN BE THERE. THE FINAL THING WE PHONE HAVE FOCUSED ON IT IS THE ONE WE WENT BACKWARDS ON QUITE FRANKLY. IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE CHIEF PIMLOTT MATCHING AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR US IS NOT JUST MILLS AND BIOMASS FACILITIES AND BIOENERGY FACILITIES BUT THE PEOPLE THAT CAN DO THE WORK IN THE FIELD. THE MACHINERY THE EQUIPMENT. TRUCK DRIVERS IT IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF THAT TO GET TO THE PACE AND SCALE THAT WE JUST HEARD DESCRIBED AND SO. HOW DO WE REALLY HONESTLY TAKE ON THE ISSUE OF CREATING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE POINT IN BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT. THINGS LIKE BIOMASS ENERGY -- THE THE LEAST ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY THING FOR US TO BE DOING IS REMOVING THE FUEL FROM THE FROM THE FOREST PUTTING INTO PILES AND BURNING IT FOR WORSHIP. ALLOWED TO BRING IN WELFARE FIRES PUTTING IT IN FACILITIES THAT CAN MAKE ENERGY OF IT. WHILE THEY HAVE SOME EMISSIONS ARE STRONG MAGICALLY IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT HAPPENS OUT THERE IS THE ALTERNATIVE AND YOU KNOW WE'RE KIND OF FACED I THINK THE SECRETARY SAY IT'S IT'S INEVITABLE. GONNA BURN ONE WAY THE OTHER AND AND WE THINK WE'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD APPROACH TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT SO FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE. KEEPING WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE I'M IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE BUT CERTAINLY BUILDING UPON IT CREATING IN. A WORK FORCE TO DO THE WORK OF CREATING PLACE OUTLETS THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS A LOT OF THAT MATERIAL THAT NEEDS TO REAP BE REMOVED AND FIRES. ASCRIBE FIRE WILL DO A LOT OF GOOD FOR US A LOT OF PLACES BUT MISTER DALEY'S POINT WE HAVE TO DO. MANAGEMENT IN MANY PLACES BEFORE THAT'S A LOT OF THE TRUE THIS IS OF NO VALUE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO TAKE IT NOBODY'S GOING TO PAY. FOR SO IT MAKES ALL THOSE PROJECTS READY SO CREATING OPPORTUNITIES TO TO TAKE THE MATERIAL CREATE MEANS WE CAN GET MORE WORK DONE IN THOSE THREE THINGS ALL ADD UP TO ACTUALLY GETTING. TO THE PACE AND SCALE OF RESTORATION -- I THINK AS I SAY WE GOT GREAT PARTNERS THAT ARE DOING GREAT WORK IN OUR REGION -- CAL FIRE HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS IN IN AWARDING SOME OF THEIR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS -- IN A PLACE THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER THE TALLEST INTEREST SIERRA AREA WHICH WILL REALLY FOCUSED ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU DO YOU NEED. BUSINESS DIFFERENTLY -- AND I GO BACK TO COLLEGE I THINK IT WAS. TO STEVEN'S IT TALK ABOUT THE NEW NORMAL RIGHT AND WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING DOWN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTIONS AND WHAT COULD BE HAPPENING IN A FEW DECADES AND WE MAY ACTUALLY YEARNED. FOR THE DAYS OF TODAY BECAUSE IT CAN GET A LOT WORSE AND IF WE DON'T CHANGE OUR PATH. IF WE DON'T IT'S HEADED SO WITH THAT. HOME CONCLUDED HAPPY DANCE QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAHLE OVERSAW ONE THINK ALL THREE OF YOU AND UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NOT TO KNOWN YOU GUYS ALL TOO WELL THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF I'M TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS OF VERY DIFFICULT. AND CHALLENGING TIMES THAT WE FACE -- SO AS AS YOU MENTIONED AND JAM WITH THAT IS IN WATERSHEDS THEIR IMPAIRED AFTER THE FIRE IN THE RECONSTRUCTION HAS TO GO ON THERE. AND THE IT I THINK WAS A VAMPIRE THAT WE REALIZE THAT IT ACTUALLY STERILIZE THE GROUND IN THEIR THEIR THERE WILL BE NO LIFE THERE FOR SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE. SO AND I HOPE SO THE GUESS THE QUESTION IS. TO BOTH YOU AND TO TPN LAW. IS THAT THE NUMBER ONE FACTOR WE HAVE IF WE REDUCE THE FUEL PERIOD. THE FIRES ARE IS AS INTENSE SO THAT THAT'S THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO REDUCE THAT FEEL NOW THAT. THE THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS OF ALL THE REASONS THAT ARE. THAT'S HARD TO DO BECAUSE THERE'S NO VALUE IN. MOST THAT FUEL. SO WE'VE DONE -- MYSELF AND MANY OTHER MEMBERS OF RAN LEGISLATION THIS FORCED PEOPLE OF TO BASE THE BY ENERGY THIS PRODUCED FROM BIOMASS. TO HAVE A PLACE TO OUTLET THAT THESE DRIVES THE COST DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND AND EXPENSE ACOSTA RESULT THE WATERSHEDS OF CALIFORNIA. THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION OF THE FORCE THAT THEY GET THE BENEFIT FROM FROM. THAT BIOMASS FACILITY SO YOU MENTIONED ABOUT SOME OF THE REGULATORY. STREAMLINING THERE IS TALK ABOUT AND I THINK MAYBE THAT THERE IS THERE SOME OPPORTUNITIES OTHER THAN JUST THE DUPLICATION OF NEPAD SEEK WERE. THAT YOU SEE -- THIS LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT TO MAYBE A STREAMLINED THE PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DO LOWER THE COST WE CAN TREAT MORE ACRES. IN THE END [inaudible] ALRIGHT SIX A JUST A THEY GO FOR IT SOME GOOD COVERAGE -- IS RETIRING ON THE FIRST. THANK YOU MISTER SECRETARY FROM WHAT OUT -- I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SYSTEM FROM TOP TO AND ASK OURSELVES WHERE ARE THE PROCESSES WERE USING ACTUALLY SERVING. THE PURPOSE THEY WERE DESIGNED TO SERVE WHICH WAS. PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT WELL INTENTIONED RIGHT AND I THINK MANY OF THEM ARE ARE SERVING A PURPOSE BUT WE HAVE TO ACT BUT WE WE HAVE OUR SYSTEMS THAT. ANALYZE THE PROPOSED ACTION. I TRIED IT -- IDENTIFY IMPACTS MINIMIZE IMPACTS ALL APPROPRIATE -- BUT WHAT YOU WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS IT'S THE INACTION. IT'S HAVING THE GREATEST ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS SO. HOW DO WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS HONEST CONVERSATION? ABOUT -- SHOULD WE BE TALKING ABOUT BROADER OPPORTUNITIES TO STREAMLINE PROCESSES FOR THINGS LIKE PRESCRIBED FIRE. IT FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE TRULY RESTORATIVE IN NATURE SHOULD THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS OF OF OTHER PROJECTS THAT. YOU KNOW COULD HAVE FAR GREATER IMPACT THAN I THINK YOU KNOW THAT ON I'M TERMS OF THE ACTUAL WORK ON THE GROUND WE HAVE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES. TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS -- MAKE IT SIMPLER MAKE IT LESS COSTLY BUT ENSURE THAT IN THE END WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT. PROTECT THE RESOURCE -- BECAUSE AGAIN YOU KNOW THE THE INACTION IS OFTEN THAT THE GREATER. PURPOSE FIGHT GREATER RISK THAN WHATEVER ACTIONS MIGHT BE PROPOSING AYE I THINK THE THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY ON THE ON THE BIOMASS IN. ISSUE IN PARTICULAR IS -- THE PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE SO CLEAR. RIGHT I MEAN WE'RE SPENDING I DON'T YOU KNOW. CHIEF BUDGET ON FIRE SUPPRESSION THE COST OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS WHEN READING THIS AIR THERE ARE A LOT OF CUT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT'S GOING OUT THERE AND THEN FOR SOME WHILE LANCE NOW. THERE'S A PUBLIC BENEFIT AND WE OUGHT TO BE WILLING TO INVEST FUNDS TO TO GET IT FACILITIES UP AND RUNNING TO GET THE WORK FORCE TRAIN AND PUT. PEOPLE ON THE GROUND I I THINK IT'S A LEGITIMATE PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND IN WHICH YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD BE AFRAID TO TO DO THAT I THINK. CREATING SOME OF THOSE INCENTIVES WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE US YOU KNOW A LOT OF SAID THE WORKING TO TRY TO GET SOME SMALLER SCALE. FACILITIES UP AND RUNNING -- WITHOUT MUCH SUCCESS AND YOU'VE DELIGHTED TO WORK TO KEEP THE EXISTING FACILITY SO I THINK THERE'S I THINK INVESTMENT COULD PLAY KEY ROLE ON ON THE ACTUAL THE IT CONSTRUCTION PIECE. SENATE JACKSON THANK YOU -- TO APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION -- I'M I'M KIND INTERESTED IF SOMEONE COULD TALK ABOUT RECENT -- NON SIERRA FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS YOU KNOW THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S. MUCH HAS A MUCH DIFFERENT VEGETATION SYSTEM AND WE DEAL MORE IN CHAPARRAL RATHER THAN IN THE BIG -- TIMBER AND TREAT. CONCEPT WE HAVE GRASSLANDS SO MIXED OAK AND PINE IN -- THE CHAPARRAL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM. WHAT EXISTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND? MOST OF THOSE FIRES IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA REALLY ARE. UM. DIRECTLY. AND SERIOUSLY IMPACTING OF HOMES GIVEN THE LOCATION OF COURSE. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT'S BEEN THE SAME THING EVEN THOUGH THAT HASN'T HISTORICALLY BEEN THE ISSUE BUT THE CHAPARRAL ISSUES IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND ARE WE DOING FUEL TREATMENT IN THESE AREAS AS AGGRESSIVELY. AS WE DOING THEM ELSEWHERE. IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION CENTER IN OF AND OF COURSE I DID YEAH I'VE OBVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE THE PROJECT -- INCENTIVES INTO MOUNTAINS OF RIVERSIDE WHICH IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WORKING IN BOTH THE CHAPARRAL. AND THE MIXED CONIFER FOREST OTHER COUNTIES HAVE BEEN VERY FORWARD. THINKING AND IN THEIR PROJECTS AND TRIP COUNTY -- FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR EXAMPLE PERFECT AREAS THAT WERE -- WITHIN THE THOMAS FIRE FOOTPRINT WERE AREAS THAT WERE EITHER UNDER TREATMENT OR HAD BEEN PROPOSED -- FOR TREATMENT AND THE CHALLENGES ARE FINDING THE RIGHT WE CAN'T TREAT. ALL SIXTY MILLION ACRES OF THE LANDSCAPE WHETHER IT'S BROKE WOODLAND CHAPARRAL OR MEXICANA. FOR SO WE HAVE TO FIND THOSE KEY AREAS TO TO MAXIMIZE OUR INVESTMENT AND PROTECTING COMMUNITIES WHERE THOSE RIDGE LINES AND AREAS SURROUNDING -- COMMUNITY WHERE WE CAN REDUCE FUEL LOADING PUTTING CRITICAL FUEL BREAKS THAT WE CAN USE FOR DEFENSIVE. I PERIMETERS AROUND COMMUNITIES I AREAS ALONG AT THE SANTA BARBARA FRONT COUNTRY AND I KNOW THERE IS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHALLENGES AND FRUSTRATIONS -- WITHIN SO EVEN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO GET -- ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE TO DO SOME OF THESE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. TO BE AT THE TABLE WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS -- TO IDENTIFY WHERE THESE CRITICAL NEEDS ARE AND GET THOSE -- ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO BUY IN. AGAIN IT'S NOT TREATING. YEAH. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ACRES IT'S TREATING VERY KEY AREAS WITH THESE URBAN INTERFACE PROJECTS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO PROTECTING COMMUNITIES AND AND THAT'S TRULY IN PARTICULAR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE KINDS OF PROJECTS WE'VE REALLY GOT TO FOCUS ON AND ARE WE DOING THAT OR WE JUST IN THE IT. IN THE EARLY STAGES OF CONSIDERING. THAT KIND OF CLEARING WERE DOING IT BUT WE CAN DO MUCH MORE. WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE TO GET US TO DO MUCH? WE NEED TO GET MORE PROJECTS APPROVED WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT GETTING UP AS THAT JIM GRAHAM SAID IN. STREAMLINING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESSES WE NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST AND WE NEED TO GET STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE AND AGREE -- TO THE THE CRITICAL NATURE OF PROJECTS THAT ARE -- LIFE SAFETY COMMUNITY PROTECTION CRITICAL. AND WITH THAT IN MIND -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE SEQUEL WE HAVE NEAT BUN AND THEY ARE. VERY DIFFERENT -- OR PARTICULARLY DIFFERENT TO THE EXTENT THAT UP -- SEQUEL REQUIRES MITIGATION IN NY BUT DOESN'T AND I THINK THAT IS A CONCERN TO SOME AYE. I DO KNOW PR IS PUBLISHED A HANDBOOK ON HOW TO DO SEEK WHEN THE BUS SIMULTANEOUSLY ON IT IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK IS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT THIS IS SOMEWHERE WHERE. WE SHOULD BE GOING BECAUSE YOU MENTION IF WE WANT TO EXPEDITE I DON'T WANT TO EXPEDITE SO THAT WE WE LEAVE OUT SOME OF THE IMPORTANT WORK OF MITIGATION THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE. INDICATED S OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. TO YES THANK YOU CENTER YEAH I MEAN I THINK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A A TYPE OF PROJECT THAT THAT WERE COMFORTABLE IS GONNA HAVE. RESTORATION VALUES RIGHT I MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE NEAT BUT NOT. WITHOUT TAKING ACTIONS THAT WE FEEL LIKE WE NEED SOME SIGNIFICANT MITIGATION EVERY CARD SO. SO. IN THE MEAN IN THAT IN THE IMMEDIATE I'M SITUATION WE FACE WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS -- THAT THAT THE CROSSWALK BETWEEN SEQUINED EVEN THAT OP ARE HAS PROVIDED -- IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE INVOLVED REALLY THE BEGINNING THE PROCESS OF WHAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FOR SERVICE. AND ARE THE FEATHER PART IS ABOUT IS LET'S DO LARGER LANDSCAPE ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND LET'S DO IT IS JOINT DEEPENED SEQUEL. AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN DO THEN THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY BUT THERE'S A BACKLOG RIGHT NOW OF CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WORK TO DO IN THE SHORT TERM THAT. WE'VE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY BUT I THINK THAT IS A LONG TERM SOLUTION OUT AGAIN. EXTRA COSTS FOR SMALL AGENCIES LIKE OURS WE DON'T IS HONESTLY FUNDED YOU KIND OF LARGELY LANDSCAPE SEQUEL BUT THE MORE THAT WE CAN DO THEN THAT FURTHER THE BETTER OFF WE'LL BE DOWN THE ROAD [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES THANK YOU. CHIEF KILL FIRE HAS BEEN MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS. AS ONE OF THE IT IMPORTANT -- AGENCIES TO HELP US THROUGH THIS PROCESS. TWO TO OVERLOOK THE PLANS -- TO IT JUST IN EVERY ASPECT OF THIS. IS CALIFORNIA PREPARED TO DO THAT TO WHAT IS IT CAL FIRE NEEDS. TO IMPLEMENT ALL THE THINGS THAT THAT WE ARE ASKING CALIFORNIA OR TAKE ON IT PROBABLY ALL USE A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP RIGHT HUTTON CAO HER FOR EVERYBODY'S WORKING VERY HARD -- THERE'S A LOT TO DO BY ALL OF US AND CAL FIRE IT IS LATE INDICATED HAS HAD PROGRAMS FOR YEARS ENGAGED IN FIRE PREVENTION AND FUELS TREATMENT BUT TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE TO THE PACE AND SCALE THAT WE NEED TO GET ALL THIS DONE. WE NEED TO RISE ALL OF THE THE BOATS WITH THE TIDE IF YOU WILL WE NEED TO LOOK AT A 100% SUPPORTING -- ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE FOR CAP AND TRADE OR FOR FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION INVESTMENTS IF WE'RE TRULY GOING TO GET LANDOWNERS. OUGHT TO BUY ENDEAVOR GOING TO GET -- INDUSTRY TO REINVEST AND AND HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE -- WE NEED TO HAVE A LONG TERM COMMITMENT AND THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IS NOT ALL THROUGH PUBLIC FUNDING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT. MONEY THAT WILL PRIME THE PUMP. AND THEN BRING IN PRIVATE INVESTORS. MATCH WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING UP THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO TAKE STAFF IT'S YOU YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADDITIONAL PRESCRIBED FIRINGS FUELS CREWS. ONGOING SUPPORT FOR THAT KIND OF INVESTMENT TO KEEP -- THAT GROWING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN SUPPORT OF SENATOR KEOGH WHILE SHE WAS IN OUR IN THE SENATE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN PASSING SENATE BILL TWELVE FORTY WHICH ALLOWS CAL FIRE IN THE BOARD OF FORESTRY TO REVIEW. THAT -- PUBLIC SAFETY I ELEMENTS OF THE GENERAL PLANTS GETS US RIGHT AT THE TABLE. WITH ENGAGING IN THE LAND USE PLANNING PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE NEED IT CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR ENGAGEMENT AND WORKING WITH. LOCAL OFFICIALS TO ENSURE THAT GENERAL PLANS HAVE THAT THAT THE ELEMENTS IN THEM FOR FIRE SAFE COMMUNITIES GOING FORWARD. AND LET ME HARDLY DE LET ME ADD ONE THING AND THAT IS THAT. YEAH I AM LOOKING AT SPREAD OF WHO'S SITTING HERE AND I JUST KNOW FROM SERVING WITH -- SENATOR JACKSON'S THAT THERE MAY ONLY BE. ONE OR TWO PEOPLE HERE THAT WERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN WE HAD THE LAST MAJOR RECESSION. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENED -- THE BUDGET RESPONSE WAS TO GO BACK TO THE BASICS AND WITHIN CAO FAR IT WAS BASICALLY. DO WHATEVER FOUGHT FIRES AT TO NOT DO MUCH MORE BECAUSE IT WAS TRYING TO BE DEFENSIVE AGAINST A MONUMENTAL CUTS THAT HAPPENED. AND SO WHEN THE CHIEF AS FOR SALE SUSTAINABILITY. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU MIGHT HAVE SOURCES THAT ARE OFF THE GENERAL FUND. THAT ARE MORE A MU AND GO TO WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS WOULD GUARANTEED BECAUSE THE FIRE CYCLES DON'T MATCH THE ECONOMIC CYCLES. AND AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT AND SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT -- WHETHER IT'S CAP AND TRADE OR OTHER THINGS THAT THAT IS TO SUSTAINABLE SOURCE THAT THE CHIEF WAS TALKING ABOUT WILL REALLY HELP GOING. FOR ALSO IF I MAY. IN YOUR STATEMENT YOU PROVIDED A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS. AND THIS WOULD THOSE AT THE SAME FOR THE REST OF YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD ALSO LIKE TO GET COPIES OF YOUR WRITTEN STATEMENTS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- CO CHAIR HOLDING. IF YOU ARE CHIEF. I WANTED TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW THE CP YOU SEE AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CHARGE IF YOU WELL -- TO TO LOOK OUT AND PUT TO REVIEW THE MITIGATION PLANS OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES [inaudible] AND WANTED TO GET A SENSE OF DO YOU CHECK THE WORK OF THE P. YOU SEE AS RELATES TO THE VEGETATION PLANTS AS AN EXAMPLE. OF UNDER THOSE MITIGATION PLANS AND WHAT ROLE DO YOU PLAY AN OVERSIGHT. FOR WORKING TOGETHER. GOOD QUESTION IN THROUGH THEIR MEMORANDUM UNDERSTANDING HELLFIRE PROVIDES THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT -- TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AS THEY'RE DEVELOPING THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS WERE PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL. ADVICE ON THE ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE IN THE PLAN AND CUT ACROSS CHECKING THAT. FOR THEM TO ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THE PLANNED FALL WITHIN THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HELLFIRE IS VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY -- TO AS THE CAUSE AND ORIGIN INVESTIGATOR FOR ALL FIRES REGARDLESS OF WHO STARTS CLUES OF OF UTILITIES AND SO WE WANT TO HAVE WE HAVE TO SEPARATE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE IN ENFORCING -- THAT THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE AS IT COMES TO FIRE STARTS OBVERSES REVIEWING AND APPROVING MITIGATION PLANS THAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND SO VERY CLEAR DELINEATION. BETWEEN THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES BUT A VERY CLEAR -- RELATIONSHIP IN PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE THAT POWER HELLFIRE HAS BOTH IN OUR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONALS. AND FIRE PREVENTION FIRE PROTECTION FOR TO ENSURE THAT THE MITIGATION PLANS HAVE ALL OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE CRITICAL. TO PROTECTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE UTILITIES AS WELL AS REDUCING THE RISK FROM FIRE STARTS. IT AND DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY DO YOU INSPECT THE LINES. CAL FIRE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE -- FOR YOU'RE ENFORCING ALL -- FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES INCLUDING -- WHEN UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE? I WOULD EQUATE IT TO KNOW DIFFERENT THAN A STOP SIGN -- WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HAVE A PERSON YOU KNOW ON ON EVERY STREET CORNER TO ENSURE EVERYBODY'S COMPLYING. IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DRIVER TO STOP AT THE STOP SIGN. IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERYONE INCLUDING UTILITIES TO ABIDE BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE. OBVIOUSLY OUR RESPONSIBILITIES IF WE DETERMINE SOMEONE TO BE IN VIOLATION WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO INVESTIGATE AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE TO A COURSE OF ACTION. AT S RELATES TO THE VICTORY CLEARANCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TREES AND THE LINES IS THAT PART OF WHAT YOU LOOK AT IT. IS PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE IS VERY CLEAR IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AYE FOR DISTANCE -- I'M CLEARANCES AROUND VARIOUS HARDWARE AND POWERLINES POWER POLES YOU KNOW WE HADOF THERE'S A LOT THAT YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE CALLED ON TO DO AND AND I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WOULD HAVE AND OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE A BUDGET. APPLICATION BUT DO YOU HAVE THE THE PERSONNEL DO YOU HAVE THE THE WHEREWITHAL TO DO ALL THAT. IS BEING CALLED TO DO BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM. OF THE P. YOU SEE THAT THEY'RE SORT OF BUILT TO MOVE SLOW. AND OTHER SOME ACTIONS OUT THERE THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHERE CAL FIRE MAY HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN INSISTING AND MOVING FORWARD. ON SOME OF THESE DIRECTORS AND HELPING TO MOVE OUT FOR FASTER. IF BY HAVING MORE. PERSONNEL THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DO SO. HELLFIRE DOES NOT HAVE THE PERSONNEL TO INSPECT EVERY POWER LINE EVERY PIECE OF INSULATOR EVERY HARDWARE -- WE IDENTIFY THOSE AS WE CAN AS WE COME ACROSS THEM AND CERTAINLY IF THERE'S A FIRE OR A VIOLATION WE WILL CERTAINLY INDICATED THERE. WERE CAL FIRE DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO INSPECT THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF POWER POLES AND MILES AND MILES OF INFRASTRUCTURE AYE I THINK WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT. NOT ASKING YOU TO BE IN THAT POSITION CLEARLY BUT IN TERMS OF HAVING A LITTLE BIT MORE RESOURCES TO HELP IN TERMS OF HELPING TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS IF YOU HAD AN ASSESSMENT OF THAT AND I'M NOT TODAY AT SOME POINT -- WHAT? INCREASING BY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PERSONNEL THAT HELPS. FACILITATE SOME OF THE WORK. WHERE THERE'S OVERLAP WITH IF YOU SEE IT MIGHT BE HEALTH? WE'VE BE HAPPY TO IDENTIFY WHAT THAT. WOULD LOOK LIKE AND AND WHAT THAT OVERLAP WOULD BE. FOLLOWING UP ON MR HOLDINGS A QUESTION. THERE YOUR YOUR OFFICE SAYS ISSUED I THINK ELEVEN CITATIONS FOR LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS -- TO FILE ACTION AGAINST INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES. I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU WOULD BE. DOES THAT CAUSE YOU TO CHANGE. THE OVERSIGHT THE YOU THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT -- IS IN THOSE IN THOSE AREAS. SO CAL FIRE AGAIN HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE AND ORIGIN OF ALL FIRES. AND IN THE CASE OF THE NORTH BAY FIRES AS YOU INDICATED SENATOR WE IDENTIFIED -- ELEVEN FIRES -- WHERE WE FOUND NOT ONLY THEIR JOB? THE UTILITY TO BE THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY FOR THE FIRE START BUT ALSO THAT THERE WAS A VIOLATION -- OF AN ELEMENT OR TWO OF THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE AND OR HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE THAT PUTS THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY. WHAT WE DO THERE THEN THAT WE CAN PROVIDE ALL ELEVEN OF THOSE -- INVESTIGATIONS NO CITATIONS HAVE BEEN ISSUE WE INVESTIGATION REPORT IDENTIFIED VIOLATIONS. THOSE IN THAT ARE TURNED OVER TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY THEY'RE MAKING THEIR DECISION ABOUT WHERE TO GO FORWARD HELLFIRE IS NOT. DOING ANYTHING WITH THOSE INVESTIGATIONS UNTIL WE HAVE. THAT RIGHT AYE I'M SO I DON'T THINK MY QUESTION WAS VERY CLEAR GAINES WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE FACT THAT THAT HAPPENED THE FACT THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED ON THE GROUND WITH THE SAFETY -- OF OUR GREAT AGAIN JUST THE ONE AREA. YOU HAVE ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU SAID PUBLIC. RESOURCES KOTOR SAFETY CODE WHATEVER CODE IT IS. SAID THE YOU HAVE OVERSIGHT IN THAT AREA SOUL ON THE OTHER SIDE NOT THE INVESTIGATIVE SIDE DOES THAT CAUSE YOU ANY. YOUR REASON FOR WANTING TO CHANGE SIZE AND THE SCOPE -- OF YOUR OVERSIGHT. ON YOU KNOW THOSE AREAS. THAT THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND PROBLEMS WITH AND SOME OF THESE AREAS WE LEARN FROM EVERY FIRE IN EVERY -- INVESTIGATION DOES HELP US IDENTIFY WHAT. WHERE RECEIVED FREQUENT CAUSES OF WE SEE A HIGHER NUMBER OF CAUSES FROM ANY PARTICULAR SOURCE? FOR EXAMPLE THEY THE UPDATING OF THE GUIDELINES FOR POWER LINES BY THAT'S ONE AREA WHERE WE REALLY WERE REP DATING THAT DOCUMENT -- IT ALLOWS US TO GO BACK AND YEAH OTHER ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IS THESE WILDFIRE. MITIGATION PLANS ARE BEING DEVELOPED THAT ALLOWS US TO BRING THAT WHAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM THESE FIRES AND BRING THAT ACROSS TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND HELP BUILD THOSE INTO THE FRAMEWORK OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS THANK YOU JESUS THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION. ETCETERA CANNELLA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SO YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED THIS QUESTION IF YOU DID I'M SORRY BUT OBVIOUSLY WERE UNPRECEDENTED TERRITORIES FORCED UP THE SCOPE AND MAGNITUDE FIRES. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT WHAT YOUR BUDGET IS TO DEAL WITH THIS AND IN WHAT THE SHORTFALL IS AND WHAT YOU WOULD NEED TO TACKLE THESE MOVING FORWARD IT. SPECIFIC TO FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES FIRE PREVENTION. WELL WE CONTINUE TO WORK AND AGAIN THAT'S WHAT WAS REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND WHAT WAS APPROVED -- IN IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WITH A HOMES NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN IN IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FORCE CARBON PLAN. SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT THAT ABOUT TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAS TO FIND SIX FIRE PREVENTION SUBSCRIBE FIRE FUELS. MANAGEMENT FEELS TREATMENT CREW -- CREWS WERE LOOKING AT AGAIN THE INVESTMENT OF A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS INTO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR ADDITIONAL HIGH CAP AND TRADE FUNDING FOR FIRE PREVENTION -- AND FORCED HEALTH PROJECTS ARE THOSE ARE ALL THINGS VEERED RIGHT TOWARDS GETTING AFTER AND CONTINUING TO INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE OF GETTING A FIRE PREVENTION WORK DONE ON THE GROUND. SO YEAR COVER FOR YOUR FULLY FUNDED TO DEAL WITH ALL THE FOR THE VEGETATION AS WERE FIRE PREVENTION THAT YOU NEED DO WITH THE MONEY YOU JUST DISCUSS. WILL AUTOMATE TO REACH OUR GOALS OF VOTING OVER FIVE HUNDRED AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES YOU'RE ANNUALLY AND TO CONTINUE TO COMBAT THIS INCREASING CHALLENGE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO NEED. TO TO MEET OR EXCEED OUR FUNDING EVERY YEAR TO CONTINUE. TO MEET THIS INCREASING CHALLENGED SO YEAH SO MISTER MAYES ASK JUST IN MY HERE SO WHAT'S WHAT'S THE TOTAL NUMBER YOU LISTEN A FEW DIFFERENT FUNDS THAT. YOU'RE GETTING WHAT'S THE TOTAL PER YEAR THAT YOU NEED. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY SIT DOWN WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND WORK ON THOSE OUR DISCUSSION DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION NOW I DON'T HAVE IT READILY AVAILABLE. IS IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S NECESSARY OR HOW HOW CAN IF WITH PART OF OUR SOLUTION IS A FUNDING COMPONENT WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER HOW HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT. I THINK IT MAY BE TO STEP IN AND ANSWER I THINK THAT IT'S THERE'S ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION THAT'S GOING TO ALL THE ACTIVITIES AND I THINK. HE IS THE THE CHIEF IS JUST. OF A KINDA CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THAT BREAKS OUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SO THERE'S THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TOTAL MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S GOING FOR THE WHOLE RANGE. OF OF FORCE PROGRAMS AND E. IN OURS A QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU JUST TERM ALL OF PREVENTION WE CAN GET WE CAN WORK WITH THOSE NUMBERS AND GET THAT. AND DE THAT DEFERRED THEIR ANSWERED YOUR QUESTIONS YOU CAN ALWAYS DO MORE. OF WE HAVE JUST DOUBLED WHAT WE ARE PROJECTING TO DO AND I'M GOING TO TRY. TO THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT METHODS THAT THE ALLOCATIONS BUT MADE MEET THAT GOAL. WELL AGAIN IT JUST SEEMS LIKE AS PART OF THE SOLUTION WE SHOULD HAVE PROPER FUNDING. WE SURE AND THE HECK DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROPER FUNDING AS WE RELY ON THE PROFESSIONALS TO TELL US. IN A CONCERNS ME THAT IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE SO I HOPE THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN GET. SO THE WE LOOK AT A TALK A LONG TERM SOLUTION WE CAN PUT THAT FUNDED IN THEIR I STILL MORE QUESTIONS BUT MISTER MAYES WAS JUMPING ON THAT POINT. YEAH THIS IS A PUT THIS REALLY IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION BECAUSE IF WE WE KNOW THAT -- WE HAVE TOO MUCH FUEL. AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A PROPERLY MANAGE WE KNOW THAT NOW WE KNOW THAT DURING THE LEAN TIMES THAT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH YOU CAN WE HAD TO CUT BACK. TO BEING VERY IMPORTANT TO US TO UNDER. THAT ALLOCATION SHOULD BE -- NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT GOING FORWARD SO BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A PLAN I'M AND END UP AND I THINK WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT IS WHAT'S THE PLAN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE. TO TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OVER. AND OVER THE NEXT COUPLE KNOW THE ONE THING THAT'S GOING ON AND I SORT OF CUT MY COMMENT SHORT BECAUSE OF THE LIMIT. IS THE THE FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S ESTABLISHED IS REALLY EVERYBODY THAT NEEDS TO BE AT THE TABLE AND DIESEL IKANA QUESTIONS IT'S THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ADDRESS. OVER TIME. WE'VE TAKEN A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF MONEY WERE DOUBLING WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WE'RE DOING IT IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND INCREASE WASTE AND WE'RE DONE BEFORE SO WE'LL GET TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. THE QUESTION IS IS WHETHER THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO DO THAT WE'RE NOT DOING HOW MUCH MORE THEY COST. AND I THINK WE'RE HAVING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT PRIVATE LAND OWNERS NGOS EVERYBODY'S AROUND THE TABLE TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. OKAY SO OF COUPLE QUESTIONS SO THAT CHIEF YOU MENTIONED THAT. THAT YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITHIN VITAL CLEARANCE CAN YOU DISCUSS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU'RE HAVING THE BILL WHO ARE THE PROBLEMS WITH. WELL IN THE CASE OF FOR EXAMPLE IN IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTERS CONCERNS ABOUT FIRE FREQUENCY WITHIN THE CHAPARRAL AND WORKING WITH THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES TO TO COME TO WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE FIRE FREQUENCY BECAUSE THERE ARE THOSE THAT. THERE'S CONCERNS IT TOO MUCH FIRE OVER -- SHORT INTERVALS CAN'T CHANGE THAT. YOU KNOW THEY GET EXOTICS OTHER SPECIES THAT WERE SITTING DOWN TO THE TABLE IN FRONT THE TERM HOW DO WE YOU COME TO SOME CONSENSUS ON WHAT THE RIGHT AMOUNT IS ABOUT THE SAME TIME. RECOGNIZING WE IF WE DON'T PROVIDE VERY FUEL MODIFICATIONS TO SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES THEY'RE GOING TO BURN. AND SO IT'S IT'S I THINK IT'S GOING BACK TO SOME OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS JUST EVEN WITHIN THE STATE FAMILY AND WE ARE LOOKING AT EFFICIENCIES BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR PERMITTING. AND A REVIEW PROCESS AND SUCH CIRCUMVENTING PROCESSES BUT IT'S LOOKING AT EFFICIENCIES AND HOW WE CAN DO THINGS TOGETHER AND WORK TOWARDS SHORTENED TIME FRAMES OF APPROVALS. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET TO THE APPROVALS IT REALLY DEPENDS AT FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO GET THE VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT APPROVED -- SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A PROGRAMMATIC DOCUMENT TO GET. DID WE LOOK AT VERY SIMILAR PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE TO HAVE VERY SIMILAR KINDS OF TREATMENTS AND VERY SIMILAR IMPACTS. ON THE GROUND AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR NUMBER OF YEARS NOW TO HAVE THIS PROGRAMMATIC DOCUMENT APPROVED IN ITS. BEING REVIEWED WE'VE HAD OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND DOES THE KINDS OF TOOLS ARE VERY HELPFUL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN GETTING THIS COMES OUT WHEN YOU'RE. GOING TO HAVE A LARGER PROGRAMMATIC DOCUMENT IT DOES TO SCIENCE AND FAX ACROSS THE BORDER CROSSED ISSUE AND WHEN YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC APPLICATION THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT SPUR. TO THAT PARCEL OF LAND OR LANDSCAPE. BUT YOU HAVE THIS BASE OF SCIENCE THAT'S BEEN DOCUMENTED APPROVED AND SIGNED OFF ON THAT YOU CAN USE AS PART OF THAT SO IT JUST MOVES YOU CLOSER TO THE OUTCOMES SURE HOW WAS IT TAKE. TO TO PREPARE THE DOCUMENT PROCESS IT THROUGH USED JUST TWELVE MONTHS EIGHTEEN MONTHS SIX MONTHS [inaudible] I YEARS. HERE S. BEST A PROGRAM AT WE ASSUME YOU CAN'T DO SPECIALIZED ENVIRONMENT DOCUMENTS ANTI DO THEM THOUGH THE LARGE ONE CUT IN INTEREST AS SECRETARY ALERTS AS A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO BUILDING THE PROGRAMMATIC DOCKET LOTS OF SCIENCE LOTS OF FEW BUILDING THE FOUNDATION AND THEN WHAT. YOU HAVE THAT DOCUMENT HE'S VERY SPECIFIC PROJECTS COMMAND THAT FALL UNDER THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHICH YOU CAN DO TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS NOT OF THE LARGER DOCUMENTS ON THE PROGRAMMATIC THING IS THE THING THAT YEARS. CIFRA PROJECTS OR MUCH BRIDGE ORDER WIDERSTAND BUT CAN YOU DO THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS INTO A LARGER DOCUMENT. YOU COULD YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO A LITTLE MORE SCIENCE OR LOAD MORE THINGS OR OTHERWISE CONTAINED IN THE LARGER DOCUMENT. SO HE DOESN'T HOLD IT OFF IT JUST MIGHT MAKE IT A LITTLE LONGER OKAY SO FEW DID A SPECIFIC DOCUMENT. I LOOK I KNOW WERE BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT PROCESS I GET THAT. BUT AGAIN IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A DECISION TO TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE HAVE TO KNOW THE FACT BUT I THINK THE REVERSE IS TRUE BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. IS THAT TRYING TO USE THE LARGER DOCUMENT TO FACILITATE PROJECTS AND MAKING THEM QUICKER SO THAT YOU GET OUT OF THE WAY WITH A LOT OF THE SCIENCE YOU HAVE CERTIFIED YOU HAVE DONE. IT CAN BE USED AND PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT EVERYTHING WHEN THEY DO THE INDIVIDUAL YEAH BY I GUESS BECAUSE I GUESS PROCESS SO. SO COULD IT COULD TAKE YEARS TO GO THROUGH THAT THE LARGER DOCUMENT. IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S HELD UP IN COURT DO YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS IS THAT WHITE EXCELLENT KNOW IDEALLY YOU WANT TO BUILD A DOCUMENT THAT IT'S NOT THE AUDIT GIVEN DOES THAT HAPPEN THOUGH. CERTAINLY IT DOES AND SO ARE AYE WE WANT TO SURE WE HAVE A DOCUMENT THAT IS SOUND AND SOLID AND HAS THE GREATEST CONSENSUS OF THE STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED GOING BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROCESS FOR LARGE SCALE NBA NFL STADIUMS AND A LOT FASTER. THAN WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT TRYING TO DO IT FOR SOME OF THESE PROCESSES WELL RIGHT. WHAT WERE ABOUT AGNOSTIC ON THAT ISSUE? SENATOR STONE I THINK YOU MISSED YOUR FIRST I WANT TO SAY -- TO CHIEF COME LOS THANK YOU -- TO YOU IN YOUR TROOPS FOR YOUR YOUR ATTENTION -- TO ALL THE FIRES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IN PARTICULAR THE THE CRANSTON FIRE IN THE HOLY FIRE AND I KNOW MANY OF YOUR TROOPS ARE FRIENDS OF MINE THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING MANY MANY HOURS TO TRY TO PRESERVE PROPERTY IN LIFE AND I I WANT TO KNOW. HOW MUCH WE ALL APPRECIATE ALL ALL OF THOSE EFFORTS? I'M NOT GETTING TO THE MATTER OF HANDS CAN YOU TELL ME -- LAST YEAR -- HOW MANY ACRES OF PRESCRIBER EARNED IT CAL FIRE? ENTERTAIN INCOMPLETE. CALVET COMPLETED JUST OVER NINETEEN THOUSAND ACRES A BROADCAST PRESCRIPTION BURN OUT DURING THIS LAST FISCAL YEAR CONCLUDING I JUNE THIRTIETH. THAT'S UP. OF FROM ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND ACRES A FEW YEARS PRIOR. OKAY AND IT BUT YOU HAVE A GOAL OF MITIGATING IF YOU WELFARE PRESCRIBE BURNS AND IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR SO. WERE A LONG WAYS OFF IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THEN. AGAIN MAYBE THAT'S OR A RESOURCE ISSUE WHICH WE CERTAINLY -- ONE KNOW ABOUT -- ALSO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINNING OF FORCE WE'VE WE'VE NEGLECTED THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR SO LONG AND WE TALK ABOUT PRESCRIBED BURNS YOU GOT TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL NOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH DENSE VEGETATION AND LOCAL COMPANIES SIR -- CAUTIOUS ABOUT PRESCRIBED BURNS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO DANCE NOW TO GET OUT OF CONTROL HAVING TROUBLE GETTING INSURANCE -- WHAT WISDOM CAN YOU OFFER SOME OF THE SMALLER COMPANIES ABOUT HOW THEY CAN DO THIS PRESCRIBED BURNS AND HE'S VERY DANGEROUS CONDITIONS THAT? YOU HAVE UNDERTAKEN I ASSUME THAT UNDER THE NINETEEN THOUSAND ACRES INTO HAVE -- PRESCRIBED IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR I ASSUME THAT NONE OF THEM GOT OUT OF CONTROL AND CREATED. A SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. THERE IS ALWAYS RISK WITH PRESCRIBED BURNING I THINK IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE NATION THERE'S ALWAYS THERE'S THERE'S AN INHERENT RISK IN PUTTING FIRE ON THE GROUND. BUT WE ALL DO COLLECT THE THOSE MITIGATING THAT RISK TO THE LOWEST POSSIBLE POINT IN THAT'S HEARD OF THAT DESCRIPTION EARLIER IT'S BURNING WHEN WE HAVE A PRESCRIPTION THAT'S WHEN THE WEATHER. THE FUEL CONDITIONS ARE ALL THAT ARE IN ALIGNMENT SO THAT IT MEETS THE PRESCRIPTION INTENSITY YOU WANT WHILE YOU SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE YOUR RISK OF A SKATE. AND AS WE WORK THROUGH THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT DO THE ABILITY TO INCREASE IS GETTING EVERYONE MORE COMFORTABLE THAT WE AGAIN YOU FOR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A CENTRALIZED APPROVAL AND TRAINING PROCESS. FOR ALL THE BURNERS IN CALIFORNIA IF WE'RE GOING TO GET BEYOND CAL FIRES TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES AND AND OTHERS WE NEED TO EXTEND AND LEVERAGE OUR ABILITY. TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS TO BRING MORE BUT WE HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY HAVE OUR PARTNERS MORE COMFORTABLE. WITH THE SHARED RISK AND IT CAN'T ALWAYS BE THE STATE ASSUMING A 100% OF THE RESPONSIBILITY. YOU KNOW FROM -- FROM A POTENTIALLY NO ESCAPED BURN ABOUT THE SAME TIME WE CAN'T PUT ALL THAT ON THE BACKS OF OF THAT BURNER IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO HOPE TO INCREASE THE SPACE AND SCALE SO IT. IT'S A TOUGH QUESTION IT'S A HARD QUESTION AND IT'S TAKEN US A LONG TIME TO GET HERE BUT THERE ARE SOME. VERY EXCELLENT DISCUSSIONS GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN THIS PRESCRIBED BURN COMMUNITY AS WE TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR LIABILITY INSURANCE WE TALK ABOUT POOLED INSURANCE THAT. THE PRESCRIBER COMMUNITY ACROSS THE LEVERAGING IDEAS WHICH SHARED POOL OF OF INSURANCE AND VERY PROMISING POTENTIAL APPROACH BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF THAT -- AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE TRUST ON THE OF THAT PART OF OUR RESIDENTS IN THE STATE THAT THEY TRUST US AND THEY TRUST ARE BERMAN PARTNERS TO GET DOWN WE HEARD FROM TESTIMONY THAT ROUGHLY 6% OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL MASS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS COVERED IN TREES OR PRICES NEED SOME TYPE OF CLEARING. OUT OF THAT I THINK ABOUT 60% OF ITS FEDERAL. HOW TELL ME ABOUT -- YOUR RELATIONSHIP OF THE U. S. FOR SERVICE AND HOW YOU ARE SYMBIOTIC IN YOUR IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP OR IS IT -- STREAM TO ME WHAT TO DO. CLEARING AND AND STATE AREAS WHICH IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY ARE YOUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS AT KEEPING UP WITH YOUR PROGRESS AND VICE VERSA. SO WE WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES STATE FEDERAL LOCAL WE ALL COME IN TO THAT WITH DIFFERENT MISSIONS BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT IN CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR -- WE ARE WE HAVE A IS EXTREMELY CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP OF THAT OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS IN PARTICULAR FOR SERVICE ARE PART OF THE FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE. UP THEIR PART OF THE WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM THAT JIM TALKED ABOUT -- THERE A CRITICAL PARTNER IN WATERSHED PROJECTS BECAUSE IT IN IN CALIFORNIA -- ISSUES WATERSHEDS FIRES INSECT AND DISEASE KNOW NO BOUNDARIES AND SO USING TOOLS SUCH AS THE GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY WHICH THE FOR SERVICES BEEN VERY OPEN AND WORKING WITH US IN DEVELOPING. UP THESE ARE ALL TO OF MEMBERS WERE SHARING RESOURCES AND WORKING ACROSS FORCE BOUNDARIES -- YES SOMETIMES WE MAY BE AT ODDS BETWEEN THE STATE'S ROLE IN MISSION ON PRIVATE LAND AND FEDERAL. MISSION AND RESPONSIBILITY AND PUBLIC POLICY BUT IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY COLLECTIVELY TO BE AT THE TABLE. AND WORK THROUGH THOSE AND NOT LET THAT BE THE IMPEDIMENT AT THE BOUNDARY. TO GET THIS WORK DONE AND I THINK ALL THE EFFORTS THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT TODAY ARE REALLY LEADING THE WAY IN BREAKING ALL THOSE BARRIERS DOWN TO GETTING THE WORK DONE. AND WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE FEDS IN THE STATE IS -- EXEMPLARY AT THE PRESENT TIME OR DO YOU THINK THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP SOMETHING NEEDS SOME MORE HELP. WITH RESPECT TO FIRE MITIGATION CLEARING GETTING RID OF A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD OR DYING TREES. ARE WE GETTING THE KIND OF COOPERATION AND THIS EMERGENCY SITUATION TO REDUCE THE SENATE CHIEF AND I SPENT YESTERDAY WITH THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR THIS WELL LISTA. AS MUCH ON REGIONAL FOR ST. AND WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE ON A LOT OF THIS BUT I WOULD REFER YOU BACK TO MY EARLIER COMMENTS THAT. THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR BUDGET FIX GO IN FOR A YEAR AND SO IF THEY HAVE TO SPEND AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON FIRE FIGHTING DEATH MUCH LESS MONEY FOR RESTORATION OF TREATMENT. AND I HAVE AND THAT IS NOT A FUNCTION OF HOW GOOD WERE GETTING ALONG IT'S A FUNCTION OF THEIR STRUCTURE SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. FIXED BECAUSE I THINK THAT SPEAK TO YOUR QUESTION FIGURE TWO MORE QUESTIONS AND NOT BE DONE. I WANT TO GET BACK -- TO THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION -- IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THE THE PRESIDENT SAY THAT THEY LIKE TO TAKE THINGS SLOW. THAT THE PC -- I THINK MANY OF US ON THE COMMITTEE WERE A BIT ALARMED BY THAT COMMENT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS HAPPEN. QUITE A BIT FASTER BUT HE MENTIONED THAT HE BASICALLY HAVE THREE DEEP THIRTY BEING COUNTERS OF THE ONES THAT ARE OVERSEEING ALL THE ELECTRICAL LINES OF THOUSANDS OF LINES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE SAW NUMBER FIRES WERE STARTED. THE FAULT OF SOME UTILITIES AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A CONCERN FOR SOME OF US MANY OF US -- WHERE DO YOU SEE MR PRIME LA DACHAU FIRE IT IN THIS NEW NORMAL IS RECALLING AND NOW DO YOU SEE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE OF A FIRE OVERSIGHT? IN THE INSPECTION PROCESS PARTNERING WITH THE P. YOU SEE TO ALLEVIATE [inaudible] THE SHORT. AMOUNT OF MANPOWER A FEW WILL THAT THEY HAVE TO ENSURE THAT. WE GET THE PROPER VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN AROUND DANGEROUS POWERLINES. I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT HE PRESENTED TO YOU IN HIS LETTER IN JULY REALLY LAYS OUT THE KINDS OF THINGS WE THINK NEED TO BE DONE. BY WORKING WITH THE UTILITIES COMMISSION AND AND THE UTILITIES THEMSELVES TO CONTINUE. TO IMPROVE AND WERE AT THE THAT THE FILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS AND REDUCE THAT RISK. I'VE OH MORE OVERSIGHT CAL FIRE AGAIN THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS MORE PEOPLE. RIGHT CLEARLY AGAIN AS I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THE DELINEATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMMISSION. AND CAL FIRES RESPONSIBILITY TO ENFORCE THE FORCE AND FIRE LAWS YES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME POWER LINE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE BUT TWO DIFFERENT PROCESSES. ONE IN STATUTE IN BEEN ONE IN IN THE REGULATORY PROCESS OUT WE NEED AND WILL CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR AMMO YOU WITH THE COMMISSION TO PROVIDE THAT TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. AND SUPPORT BUT CERTAINLY AS THE FORWARD TO DISCUSS. IMPROVING THESE MITIGATION PLANS TO ENHANCE OF THE ABILITY TO GET MORE -- A THIRD PARTY OVERSIGHT AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL -- ELEMENTS WITHIN THOSE PLANS TO REDUCE RISK [inaudible] APPRECIATE THAT -- AND THEN LASTLY -- I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT THIS PROGRAMMATIC OUT HE AYE ARE -- THAT. SUCH THAT WE CAN NOT EXPEDITE -- REVIEWS OF AREAS WE NEED TO BE CLEARED BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S A LEASE ALARMING FOR ME THAT IT'S GOING TO BE YEARS BEFORE WE HAVE THAT PROGRAMMATIC <u>&lt;c.green&gt; I ARE IN&lt;/c&gt;</u> SUCH PLACES YEAH MANY GOING TO DEAL WITH THE LITIGATION THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AFTERWARDS -- WHEN I GO OUT AND TOWN HALLS GOING TO COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW ON FIRE RAGED AREAS OF OF MY DISTRICT PEOPLE ARE SAYING WOULD YOU DO AND? TO REDUCE THIS RISK ON US WE HAVE THE FIRE COME YOU KNOW RIGHT UP TO THE BACKYARD OF A HOME IN LEGAL STORAGE YOU KNOW IT GOT VERY VERY CLOSE. SOME OF THE RESIDENCES IN AND AND MANY OF MY FIRE COMMUNITIES -- MOSTLY OUT IN THE IDYLLWILD AREA THAT YOU MENTION ARE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS BEEN THE BENEFICIARY OF OF GRANTS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB CLEARING YOU DID A GREAT JOB OF CLEARING THAT. SAVE A LOT OF WIRES FROM THE THE CRANSTON FIRE FROM -- MAKING ITS WAY -- INTO INTO HOMES [inaudible] AND I I KNOW WE WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW WE DISCUSS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES HERE ON THE DAIS AND OUT I WANT TO PIGGYBACK ON MY MY MY COLLEAGUE A SENATOR CAN I WAS. COMMENTS THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE TALK ABOUT -- REASONS WHY WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET IN THERE TO EXPEDITIOUSLY REMOVED [inaudible] RUSSIAN AND TREES AND WE TALK ABOUT WELL WE HAVE SOME. ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIERS THAT WE HAVE TO MOVE THROUGH -- IS NOTHING PROVOKES MORE ANGER IN MY DISTRICT THAT WHEN I GIVE AN EXCUSE LIKE THAT. AND SO HOW CAN WE BE SENSITIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT UNDERSTAND THE RISKS OF THE DELAYS THAT THESE REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON US. TO EFFECTIVELY GO IN AND CLEAR BRUSHING CLEAR TREES IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF PROTECTING. OUR RESIDENTS THAT ARE SCARED TO DEATH. THERE HOMES ARE GOING TO BE BURNED DOWN AND AFTER A FIGHT WITH THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY BECAUSE IT MAY BE UNDER INSURED I CAN'T GET BACK INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN GET A BILL FAST -- HOW CAN WE EMBARK ON SOME TYPE OF THE STREAMLINING PROGRAM THAT IS SENSITIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENT THAT GETS THE BRUSHING GETS THE TREES? ATTY HERE POST HASTE. WELL JUST TO CLARIFY IT. SO WE HOPE TO STOP IT TAKES SEVERAL YEARS MORE FOR THE I. R. IT'S BEEN IN PROCESS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT WE ARE WHO WE WERE LITERALLY BRINGING IT TO FRUITION AND SO. WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT DOCUMENT WILL BE IN PLAY HERE. SHORTLY IN THE INTERIM WE HAVE OTHER PROCESSES BY WHICH WE GET PROJECTS APPROVED WEEK ME LOOK AT THEM ON THE INDIVIDUAL BASIS WE WORK THROUGH THE SECRET PROCESS -- AND AND GET THEM DONE OBVIOUSLY TO IMPLEMENT OVER FOUR HUNDRED GRANTS ALREADY IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WERE GETTING A LOT OF GOOD WORK DONE. ARE ON THE GROUND IN THERE'S THERE'S MANY COMMUNITIS THAT ARE FINDING THROUGH FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ARE. IN THE WORK IS GETTING DONE WE JUST NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT EFFICIENCIES IN THESE AREAS WHERE ABOUT MAYBE WERE NOT IN AGREEMENT AND FIND A WAY A PATH THROUGH. THE WE WERE GETTING THE DOCUMENTS DOWN IN AGAIN ARE WILL BE ONE OF A NUMBER OF TOOLS THAT ALLOW US TO GET STAND MORE FISH. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR SERVICE AND I HOPE YOU'LL BLOOD -- TAKE THEIR RECOMMENDATION ABOUT WORKING CLOSER WITH THE PC IS OVERSEEING SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE VERY CONCERNED. FOR I WOULD TO LAST COMMENTERS QUICKLY THEY TOLD ME -- MISTER WOOD INDUSTRY DOLLARS FIRST. MISTER CHAIR SAMPRAS WELL THANK YOU CHIEF IT'S GONNA -- I DIDN'T THINK I'D EVER GET TO KNOW ALL YOUR UNIT CHIEF SINCE I'M HERE INCIDENT COMMANDERS -- SO CLOSELY BUT I KEEP RUNNING INTO THEM BECAUSE OF THESE FIRES SO I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING AND EVERYTHING A DART ARE DOING TO PROTECT PROPERTY AND AND PEOPLE -- COUPLE YOU KNOW MIGHT TAKE AWAY FROM LISTENING TO YOU IS THAT. FOR SOME THESE ACTIVITIES TO REALLY HAPPEN WE NEED A LONG TERM SUSTAINED SOURCES THAT A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION. YES OKAY ALRIGHT. JUST SAY THAT AGAIN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN THAT'S WHAT SOME OF US BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR QUITE AWHILE. AND I RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD WE GET INTO A BUDGET SITUATION BOARD TO HAVE AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT ISN'T GOING. TO HAMPER YOUR ABILITY TO DO YOUR JOB FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION AND PREVENTION SO SO THANK YOU -- THANK YOU MS Y. MAKE SURE WE'RE CLEAR ON THAT APPRECIATE THAT. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE RACIAL PROGRAMS AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS OUT THERE. AND THEY'RE OVERSEEN BY WHAT YOU. ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT APARTMENTS. IS THERE ANYONE OVERSEEING THESE IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY. SO AND I AND THE RECENT LET ME LET ME LET ME PHRASE THIS IN A WAY THAT. FOR EXAMPLE -- BROADBAND IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE WORKED ON SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE YEARS AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MOVE FOR A BROADBAND PROJECTS IS. THAT A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT GRANT PROGRAMS HAVE TO GO THROUGH GO THROUGH MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND BY THE TIME YOU GET ONE LINED UP. WERE TO LINE UP THE FIRST ONE MAY HAVE EXPIRED. SO SO YOU KNOW. WHO DOES ANYONE HAVE THE BIG PICTURE YOU COULD SHOOT SOMEBODY SO WE TALK ABOUT STAKEHOLDER HAVING OBSTACLES AT THE TABLE? TO ACTUALLY GO THROUGH SOME OF THESE SO I CAN ACTUALLY MOVE FORT OR SECOND BE THE FACT THAT FORCE TASK FORCE IT GONNA BE AND PARK THAT BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED INTO. IT IN THE FORM THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOLLY UNMODERATED YESTERDAY IN REDDING WAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TALKED ABOUT EVERY AGENCY AND HOW THEY DON'T WORK TOGETHER. WE ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE MOST OF THEM IN THE RESOURCES AGENCY AND NOW THE TASKFORCE TAKING THEM ALL SO WE AT THE STATE LEVEL HAVE BEEN BETTER ABOUT BEING ABLE TO BREAK DOWN THE SILOS. TO TO TRY TO HAVE THE IMPETUS TO GET THINGS IF I COULD MAYBE SAID TO THE MISTER WOOD AND UNDER THE WATER SYNDROME PROGRAM THAT'S EXACTLY WE'RE DOING WITH OUR STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS. WERE MEETING UP THE MEETING THE CHIEFS CONFERENCE ROOM TO TO SIT DOWN WITH FOLKS AND SAY YOU GOT THIS PART OF MONEY WE GOT THAT. WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU PUT THESE PROGRAMS ON ON ON THE LANDSCAPE AND HOW WE DO IT IN A MORE SEVERE YOU PLAY SO -- IT TAPPING IT SOMEONE ORGANIC IN THAT CASE BUT IT'S DEFINITELY. WITH THE FUNDS THAT ARE NOW BECOMING AVAILABLE IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE DO THAT I THINK WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING THAT. HAPPY TO EXPORT THE MODEL ELSEWHERE. SO THE THE X. AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE EARLIER COMMENTS EXPANSION OF THE FIRE SEASON THIRTY DAYS EARLIER THIRTY DAYS LATER NOW. THAT IS THAT OBVIOUS IS HAVING AN EFFECT ON YOUR ABILITY TO THE PREVENTION OR OR IS IT NOT. NO CLEARLY AS YOU KNOW WE WERE FORTUNATE AGAIN SOMEBODY AUGMENTATIONS OF BEEN YEAR ROUND STAFFING ON FIFTY TWO FIRE ENGINES AND THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO GIVE US A SOME EXTRA PUNCH DURING THAT THAT. TRADITIONALLY NON FIRE SEASON MONTHS -- AND WE WE LEVERAGE THAT AGAIN THIS YEAR BUT THE WINDOW TO GET THE WORK DONE THIS YEAR WAS VERY VERY SHORT. WE WENT RIGHT FROM THROUGH DECEMBER WE WERE ABLE TO DO MUCH WORK AT ALL IN THE FALL THAT'S KIND OF OUR FALL BURNING WINDOW. AND THEN WE HAD RAIN AND WE WERE IN A WINDOW TO BERNARD DO WORK WE DID WHAT WE COULD. AND THEN WE'RE RIGHT BACK INTO FIRE ACTIVITY AND SO IT'S A IT IT. THE IT IS IMPACTING FIRE SEASON IS IMPACTING ALL OF THIS IT'S IMPACTING CAPACITY AND IT'S IMPACTING THE WINDOWS. WHICH WE CAN SAFELY GET THE WORK DONE. SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT EIGHT EIGHT DEDICATED PREVENTION. COMPONENT THAT WORKS ON THESE THINGS YEAR ROUND AND AND YOU'RE AND YOU'RE FINE AS SEPARATE DEPARTMENT THAT THIS FIRE PREVENTION THE SIX FIRE A PRESCRIBED FIRE FUELS CRUZ IS EXACTLY WHAT THAT'S GEARED TOWARDS ITS THESE. THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE FOCUSED ON THIS TWELVE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR. I TAKE ADVANTAGE OR THINGS THEY CAN EVEN DO DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS THAT -- ARE LOW RISK THAT CAN KEEP WORK GOING ON ALL YEAR. THANK YOU SHARON SO. AND VEGETATION TO THIS FOR CAN. CHIEF HAD LOTS USE ME. A SO YOU YOU MANAGE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT EDUCATION I THINK THE SENATOR BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT THAT YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT FORESTRY WE TALK ABOUT. BUT THERE IS THERE'S OAK WOODLANDS THERE'S A CHAPARRAL THERE'S FORCES WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEGETATION IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S ALL LIVE. IT'S ALL GROWING. PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND AND MOISTURE AND ALL THOSE THINGS MAKE IT GROW. AND THERE'S BEEN A BIG HUGE DEBATE NATIONALLY FOR ABOUT THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND HERE IN THE STATE ABOUT WE SHOULD JUST WALK AWAY FROM IT AND LET IT DO ITS NATURAL THING. AND THERE'S BEEN MANY LAWSUITS. MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS -- AT EACH OTHER'S THROAT OVER HOW WE SHOULD MANAGE BUT WE KINDA AT LEAST IN MY MIND. THE CONCLUSION IS IF WE JUST DO NOTHING AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW WE DO NOT THINK. AND WE JUST LET IT GO BACK TO ITS NATURAL STATE. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF OF NGUYEN BUT OR WILL LET'S WIN IT WILL BURN IT WILL EVENTUALLY BURN CORRECT CORRECT. SO. WHAT WE TALK ABOUT THE PROCESSES THAT? WE MOVE THROUGH. AND AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN HIGHLY FRUSTRATED [inaudible] AT I'VE READ TWELVE BILLS IN THE SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE ADDRESSING. ALL THAT MOVING PIECES THAT YOU HAVE TO GET THROUGH TO GET TO SOMEPLACE TO DO. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. AS WITH A HEAVY HEART. WE TALKED BICU WE LOST ANOTHER ONE TODAY HOW WE'RE GONNA LOSE LIVES RELEASE PROPERTY. BUT WE WILL WORRY ABOUT A BUG OR A RED LEGGED FROG. OR ARE YOU NAME IT. AND ANY TIES AND IF YOU GO OUT LOOK ON THE GROUND I HAVE PHOTOS OF THEM. DESTROYED THE HABITAT GONE THEY'RE DEAD. WERE BREATHING CARBON WE'RE TRYING TO SEQUESTER. AT THE PACE AND SCALE THAT WE NEED TO MOVE TO GET OUR FOR VEGETATION WHETHER IT'S IN. GREAT SENATORS DISTRICT OR ITS AND THE VALLEY OR FITS IN. THE FOOT HILLS AND FOREST. WHAT IS THE SOLUTION WHAT IS THE SOLUTION TO GETTING US TO A PROGRAM? TYPE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FIVE YEARS. THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM. DELIVER SOMETHING AS LEGISLATORS TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. THAT TAKES CARE OF THE FUEL LOADING PROBLEMS OUT THERE. WELL THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS THAT THE IT'S NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE PROTECTION OF SENSITIVE SPECIES AND HABITAT AND INCREASING OUR PACE AND SCALE OF FUELS TREATMENT AND FORCE MANAGEMENT. BUT IT CAN IT CAN ALL BE DONE -- IT'S A MATTER OF BRINGING EVERYBODY TOGETHER PROJECTS THAT JIM BRANHAM TALKED ABOUT HERE IN THE CENTRAL SIERRA TAHOE INITIATIVE THEY'RE ALL AT THE TABLE AND WE'RE TALKING. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES READY AND PARTNERS WE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING JUST THIS YEAR FROM JUST THE STATE WITH MATCHED FUNDING FROM OTHER PARTNERS THOSE OF THE PROJECTS WE NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE STAKEHOLDERS A TABLE. WE JUST WE NEED TO GET. THE CHAINSAWS WE GET FOLKS ON THE GROUND AND START TO WORK AND IN MANY CASES ENVIRONMENTAL. REVIEW WAS READY TO GO WE NEED TO FIND THOSE PROJECTS. HIGHEST PRIORITIES AND AND AND START THE WORK RIGHT NOW AND BUILD THAT MOMENTUM SO WE CAN TRULY GET TO THESE GOALS. EVERY SINGLE BILL THAT I PROPOSED WAS. OPPOSED BY NOW NAY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME IF YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BURN WE TALK ABOUT. IN THE FORCED THE SIZE OF A TREE YOU CAN HARVEST. AND SOME OF THOSE ARE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME VALUE IN THEM. IF YOU HAVE A FORCED OF OLD GROWTH TREES. NICE TO SAY THEY'RE ALL FIFTY INCHES IN DIAMETER AND THE CANOPIES. THEY'RE SO CLOSE TO EACH OF THAT THERE'D THERE'D. DO YOU THEY WILL CROWN OUT AND BURN. TO THE GROUND. AND THEIR OLD GROWTH TREES OR WHAT WE CAN SEVERAL GROWTH IF YOU REMOVE SOME OF THOSE. AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE AN OPEN CANOPY WHERE THE FIRE COMES THAT FLOOR. AND WE HAVE PHOTOS IN ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION THE SHOWS THAT WHEN THAT WHEN YOU DO ACTUALLY OF THIN THAT OUT. THAT THOSE TREES ARE STILL ALIVE WHEN YOU DON'T SEQUESTER CARBON. HOW CAN WE GET THROUGH A PROCESS WHEN WE ACTUALLY START TALKING ABOUT? THE CANOPY ON THE GROUND OR THE VEGETATION ON THE GROUND THAT'S MANAGEABLE FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO GET INTO SAFELY RESTORE WATERSHEDS AND GET TO OF A PERMITTING PROCESS WE DON'T GET. SUIT AND LOBBIED AND SCORE CARDS AND ALL THOSE THINGS OUT THERE THAT ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. EXPERTS SCIENTISTS INCLUDING DOCTOR DOCTOR STEVENS THAT DR MALCOLM NORTH DOCTOR JOHN BATTLES ALL AGREE. FOR THEY HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION THEY HAVE THE SCIENCE TO INDICATE WHAT THE RIGHTS TO THAT FUNDING LEVELS ARE WHAT THE NUMBER OF TREES PER ACRE BASED ON THE LOCATION. THE SCIENCES ALL THERE NOW WE JUST HAVE TO GO OUT ON THE GROUND TO PUT IT TO WORK. AND IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE THING MISTER ALI -- AS WE'VE BEGUN BRING FOLKS TOGETHER INCIDENT IN AND TRY TO WORK THROUGH WHAT THE SCIENCE IS TELLING US WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS YEAR AT LEAST WE HAVE A LOT OF ENVIRONMENT GROUPS THAT ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED. IN HELPING US FIGURE IT OUT AND THEY'RE NOT PURSUING LITIGATION AS THEIR STRATEGY NOT EVERYONE'S A BOARD OF THAT PROBABLY NEVER WILL BE BUT I THINK THAT THE CHIEF'S POINT. USE THE SCIENCE ME BY GUIDED BY THE SCIENCE AND IT'S TELLING US THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THERE'S A LOT OF OF REALLY GOOD INVOLVEMENT FROM. THE ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE ON THAT AND I THINK. IF IT'S A TESTAMENT TO THE TO SIT DOWN AND FIGURE IT OUT TOGETHER. NOT BEING SATISFIED WITH OUTCOMES THAT YOU DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED. MAYBE WE'LL HAVE A NEW NORMAL IN THE LEGISLATURE LUCY. I WANT TO THANK ALL THREE OF YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS BRANHAM THAT MISTER SECRETARY. HE HAD -- CHIEF UP I THINK. NOT ON THIS IS MORE THE PREVENTION THE CLEARING SIDE NOT THE SUPPRESSION SIDE. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO CALL YOU OUT AT ALL OF THE WOMEN IN MEN. IN YOUR OPERATION AND ALL THE MUTUAL AID -- BECOMES TO HELP -- CAO FIRE ON ALL THESE FIRES THROUGHOUT THE STATES WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] CO CHAIR. I WILL NOW CALL FORWARD THE FINAL PANEL OF THE DAY THIS WOULD BE DEALING WITH WOOD PRODUCTS MARKETS. AND BIOMASS POLICY -- WILL CALL FOR RICH GORDON PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION [inaudible] JONATHAN KOZOL. EXECUTIVE RECTOR SIERRA INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNITY AND ENVIRONMENT. EDWARD RANDOLPH DIRECTOR CPUC ENERGY DIVISION. AND CATHERINE PHILLIPS SIERRA CLUB. CATHERINE IS NOT HERE SO. TELL ME YOUR NAME. I HAD WOULD MORENO UP THIS YEAR COULD CALIFORNIA NINE ALONG WITH -- DE NUMBER. VERY GOOD. COULD I JUST POINT OUT THAT ALL THE PANELS WE HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE WOMAN [inaudible] JUST. TODAY WE HAVEN'T HAD IF I'VE MISSED SOMETHING. HE WAS INVITED BUT THE OPTICS HERE ARE SOMEWHAT STUNNING AND I JUST WANTED TO POINT THEM OUT. OKAY RICH TO UNFOLD AND MAKE YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF THERE ARE MANY FACTORS RELATED TO THE CATASTROPHIC FIRES THAT CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCING [inaudible] HISTORIC DROUGHT. HOTTER TEMPERATURES LOWER HUMIDITY. LAND USE DECISIONS. AND INCREASING URBAN WILDLIFE INTERFACE. A LACK OF INVESTMENT IN PREVENTION. BUT PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IS SIMPLY THIS. THERE IS TOO MUCH FUEL. CALIFORNIA HAS A VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROBLEM. OUR GRASSLANDS ARE OVERGROWN. WE HAVE TOO MUCH CHAPARRAL. AND OUR FORESTS ARE OVERLY DENSE. IF WE DO NOTHING ELSE TO PREVENT FIRES. WE MUST REDUCE THE FUEL LOAD. THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO ASSURE THAT HOMEOWNERS CREATE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. WE HAVE TO INCREASE GRAZING OF OUR GRASSLANDS. WE HAVE TO REDUCE CHAPARRAL. WE HAVE TO REMOVE DEAD TREES AND THIN OUR FORESTS. DEALING WITH OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROBLEM LEAVES US WITH THIS DILEMMA. WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS MATERIAL? REMEMBER WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HIS WAIST. A HOMEOWNER WHO CREATES DEFENSIBLE SPACE. SEIZE THE CUT MATERIAL AS WASTE. CHAPARRAL REMOVED FROM A LANDSCAPE IS WASTE. WHEN THINNING THE FOREST? ANY TREE WITH VALUE TURNED INTO LUMBER. IT'S THE LIMBS [inaudible] THE BARK [inaudible] TOPS. THE VERY SMALL TREES AND ANYTHING THAT CANNOT BE TURNED INTO LUMBER [inaudible] THAT'S WASTE. WE CALL THIS WASTE BIOMASS. AND WHAT DO WE DO WITH BIOMASS. WHAT LANDFILLS CAN'T TAKE THIS MATERIAL? AND ONLY SO MUCH OF IT CAN BE TURNED INTO DECORATIVE CHIPS OR ANIMAL BEDDING. THE REST YOU COULD LEAVE TO ROT ON THE LAND. BUT IT IS STILL FUEL. AND WHILE RIDING IT RELEASES TOXIC POLLUTANTS. IF YOU HAVE A TIMBER AG OPERATION YOU CAN BURN IT OPEN PILE BURNING. BUT IT THAT ALSO RELEASES CARBON AND POLLUTANTS [inaudible] OR YOU CAN TAKE IT TO A BIOMASS FACILITIES WERE CAN BE TURNED INTO ENERGY. NOW YOU'LL HEAR THAT THIS IS NOT A CLEAN SOLUTION. BUT STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE EMISSIONS FROM BIOMASS FACILITIES. ARE BETTER FOR AIR QUALITY. WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER OPTIONS? INCLUDING PILE BURNING. IT'S CERTAINLY BETTER THAN WILDFIRE [inaudible] AND REMEMBER. THESE FACILITIES OPERATE WITH PERMITS YOU SHOULD BY LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THAT LOCAL AIR QUALITY GOALS ARE ACHIEVED. AND YOU'RE TECHNOLOGIES MAKING THESE FACILITIES CLEANER ALL THE TIME. YOU'LL ALSO HEAR THAT BIOMASS IS EXPENSIVE ENERGY. WHEN COMPARED TWO OTHER RENEWABLE SOURCES THAT HAVE BENEFITTED FROM SUBSIDIES? BIOMASS IS NOT THE CHEAPEST RENEWABLE. BUT I BELIEVE AT THIS MOMENT. ANY DISCUSSION OF COST. MUST INCLUDE THE ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIAL COST. IN LOS LIVES [inaudible] DESTROYED PROPERTY. AND DEVASTATED LANDSCAPES AND COMMUNITIES. THE SOCIAL COST OF NOT REMOVING EXCESS FUELS. FOR MORE WILD LANDS AND FORESTS. PERHAPS WE NEED TO FIND A WAY SOME WAY TO SUBSIDIZE BIOMASS IS PART OF OUR FIRE PREVENTION STRATEGY. THANKS TO PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE ACTION SEVEN BIOMASS PLANTS PRODUCING UNDER SEVENTY FIVE MEGAWATTS. CONTRACTS TO REDUCE POWER. AND ANOTHER SIXTEEN PLANTS ONLINE PRODUCING A TOTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MEGAWATTS OF POWER. SOME OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL EXPIRE IN THREE SHORT YEARS. THERE'S LOW HANGING FRUIT. THE LEGISLATURE COULD WORK TO GUARANTEE THE EXTENSION THE A CONTRACTS FOR ALL OF THESE FACILITIES. SO THESE PLANTS REMAIN OPERATIONAL FOR A LONGER TERM OF TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS. THE COST OF THESE CURRENT FACILITIES IS INCLUDED IN EXISTING RATES. SO THIS WOULD NOT TO INCREASE THE COST FOR ANY RATE PAYER. SPECIFIC ACTION COULD ALSO BE TAKEN TO MAKE THESE CONTRACTS MORE EFFICIENT. BY ALLOWING FACILITIES TO TAKE MATERIAL FROM A BROADER RANGE OF HAZARD ZONES. THEY'RE ALSO SHUDDERED BIOMASS FACILITIES. BUT WE BROUGHT BACK ON LINE IN NINETY DAYS OR LESS WITH AN EXPANSION BIOMASS PROCUREMENT. AND PERHAPS THIS SHOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED. YOU WILL HEAR FROM SOME THAT THERE ARE OTHER USES FOR THE BIOMASS MATERIAL. THINGS LIKE NEW WOOD PRODUCTS OR CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER. EVENTUALLY THAT MAY BE TRUE. BUT WE ARE STILL AT THE DAWN OF THAT TECHNOLOGY [inaudible] CHAPARRAL. AND WILDLAND FUELS. WE'LL NEVER BE CANDIDATES FOR NEW WOOD PRODUCTS. FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. WE NEED TO TURN OUR EXCESS FUELS INTO ENERGY. I WOULD REMIND YOU. IT TWO DAYS OF THE WINE COUNTRY FIRES AND SENATOR DODD'S DISTRICT. RELEASED IN AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GASES. EQUAL TO A FULL YEAR OF VEHICLE EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE ARE TO MEET OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. IF WE ARE TO PROTECT LIVES AND PROPERTY. AND IF WE ARE TO MAINTAIN OUR AND FIRE MIDDLE VALUES. WE MUST HAVE A STRONG VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA SIMPLY PUT. ANY APPROACH TO CALIFORNIA'S WELFARE PROBLEMS MUST INCLUDE. A FUELS REDUCTION COMPONENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SAVE INEXPERIENCED JUSTIN THE ORDER THAT YOU RECALL. COUPLE WELL WITH HIM ON BOB. GOT GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS I'M EVERGRANDE OFF THAT DIRECTOR OF THE ENERGY DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. ON THE CPU SEES RESPONDED AGGRESSIVELY TO THE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN GOVERNOR STRING MORTALITY EXECUTIVE ORDER. THE RESPONSE THAT ORDER -- AND IN RESPONSE TO S. B. I THREE FIFTY NINE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE CPC IS INSTRUCTED THE THREE LARGE -- INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA I'D TO PROCURE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MEGAWATTS OF BIOMASS FOR FACILITIES THAT ARE COMMITTED TO BURNING FUEL FROM HIGH HAZARD ZONES. ON AS HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY CALVET. OFFER POINT OF REFERENCE -- THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND I THIRTY MEGA WATTS OF BIOMASS FIT FACILITY STATEWIDE -- UNDER CONTRACT WHICH NOW REPRESENTS ABOUT TWO POINT 4% OF TOTAL ELECTRIC SYSTEM DEMANDED. THE BIOMASS OF PROCUREMENT -- FOCUSED -- THE BIO BASTROP PROCUREMENT FOCUS IN FORCE MANAGEMENT HAPPENS UNDER THREE DIFFERENT PROGRAM TYPES. I THOUGHT THE FIRST UNDER CP YOU SEE DIRECTIONS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE GOVERNOR'S SIDE EXECUTIVE ORDER -- YA USE NEGOTIATED INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS WITH SOME EXISTING MY BIO PLANTS ARE THEY WERE UNDER CONTRACT BUT WE'RE NO LONGER OPERATE NOW PROFITABLY DUE TO CHANGING PRICING. TO ON SOME OF THOSE CONTRACTS THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT -- LATER HAD SOME UNIQUE FEATURES -- FOCUSED ON I'M HELPING THE UTILITIES ARE MANAGE YOUR OWN FUEL ON IN REDUCING THE OVERALL COST OF GETTING THE FUEL OF THE FORCED. ON THE SECOND PROGRAM I WAS UNDER THE BIO RAM PROGRAM AYE THE BIO RAM PROGRAM IS A RENEWABLE AUCTION -- WHERE UTILITY PUTS OUT A I REQUEST FOR OFFERS AYE AND FACILITIES CAN BID INTO THAT THE UTILITY THEN TAKES THE LOWEST TARGET OF THAT PROGRAM -- WE CONDUCTED ONE PROGRAM AND MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OR THE UTILITIES DEAD ON AND THEN AFTER S. B. EIGHT FIFTY NINE PASSED ON ORDERING MORE PROCUREMENT THERE WAS A SECOND -- PROCUREMENT IN LATE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ARMORED UNDER THOSE TWO PROCUREMENTS THERE WERE AYE TOTAL ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR MEGA WATTS -- BIOMASS APPEARED UNDER ON THURSDAY PROCUREMENTS AYE THIRD -- IS A PROGRAM WHERE IT'S CALLED BIO MAT -- THE BIO MAT PROGRAM IS HAS A LOT MORE COMPLICATED PRICING STRUCTURE -- THAT IS TARGETED TOWARDS VERY SMALL FACILITIES IT USED TO BE THREE MEGAWATTS FACILITIES IT'S NOW UP THE FIVE MEGAWATT FACILITIES -- IT'S A MECHANISM WHERE IT STARTS AT A SET PRICE AND THE PRICE WILL GO UP OR DOWN DEPENDING UPON HOW MANY MARKET PARTICIPANTS THERE ARE. IN AN EFFORT TO FIND ON THE PRICE THAT THE MARKET PARTICIPANTS NEED TO BE PROFITABLE -- I'M UNDER THAT PROGRAM ON THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ON THE OTHER LEGISLATION REQUIRED TO DO YOU SEE TO MAKE SOME PROGRAM CHANGES TO I'M STREAMLINED THAT -- THAT P. YOU SEE I DID IMPLEMENT THAT THE THE ONE MAIN CHANGE WAS TO MOVE THE ELIGIBLE SIDES FROM A THREE MEGAWATTS. TO FIVE MEGAWATT FACILITY -- THERE ALSO CHANGES DONE TO AYE THE INTERCONNECTION PROCESS I'D TO HELP MAKE THE IN THEIR CONNECTION PROCESS FOR THE SMALLER FACILITIES. I HAD -- HOPEFULLY HAPPEN QUICKER BOB BETTER INTERACT WITH THE PROGRAM RULES AND AND I CHALLENGES STILL EXIST IS TO REDUCE THE INTERCOM INTERCONNECTION COSTS -- ON THESE PROGRAMS I'M HAVE SOME REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY I DO MEET THE GOALS OF REDUCE REDUCING THE FORCE FIELDS. ARE THE BIO RAM FACILITIES HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO USE AT LEAST HAZARD ZONES -- IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN 80% OF THE FUEL -- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND BEYOND AND THEN FOR POINT OF REFERENCE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE FACILITIES AVERAGE 55% OF THE FUEL FROM THE HIGH HAZARD ZONE. I THESE TARGETS WERE SET IN STATUTE AND BY THE P. YOU SEE -- TO MAKE SURE THESE FACILITIES ARE HELPING WITH THE FORCE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGE THE PHILLIES THE FACILITIES ARE PAID A PREMIUM IF THEY CAN MEET THOSE TARGETS. OFFER THE FACILITIES UNDER THE BY A RAMP PROGRAM IF THEY MEET THOSE TARGETS EITHER PAID ON AVERAGE A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MEGAWATTS A HUNDRED FIFTEEN DOLLARS -- IF ON SOME OF THOSE FACILITIES DEPEND UPON WHICH PROGRAM THEY PARTICIPATED UNDER THEM IF THEY CAN'T MAKE THOSE TARGETS THEY CAN STILL SELL THEIR ENERGY AND EIGHTY NINE DOLLARS PER MEGAWATT HOUR. ON SOME OF THOSE CONTRACTS HAVE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACT WOULD BE TERMINATED IF THEY CAN'T MAKE THE PROVISIONS. BOB FOR COMPARISON SAKE A SIMILARLY SIZED SOLAR WIND CONTRACT -- THAT WOULD PARTICIPATE IN SIMILAR PROGRAM TODAY -- THE UTILITY COULD SIGN A CONTRACT FOR THEM FOR LESS THAN FIFTY DOLLARS A MEGAWATT SO ROUGHLY -- A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF AS MUCH -- THE PRICING MECHANISMS FOR THE SMALLER PROJECTS UNDER THE BIO MAT PROGRAM AS I'VE EXPLAINED IT'S DIFFERENT -- IN IT'S AN ADJUSTING MECHANISM ARE RIGHT NOW THREE PROJECTS HAVE -- HAVE EXECUTED CONTRACTS ARE THOSE A BELIEVER A LITTLE OVER AHUNDRED AND NINETY DOLLARS PER MEGAWATT HOUR. ON IN THE THE PROJECT PRICE RIGHT NOW IS I JUST SHORT OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MEGAWATT HOUR FOR THOSE PRO. I'M LAST DECEMBER -- THE P. C. DID CAP PRICES ON THE OVER ALL BIOMET PROGRAM THAT PROGRAM WAS CREATED BEFORE -- THE THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ON BECAUSE IT HAD HIT A A PREDETERMINED PRICE CAP THAT REQUIRED ON A STALL OF THE PROGRAM -- WHILE THE P. C. -- EXAMINE THE PROGRAM TO SEE IF REFORMS COULD BE MADE -- I TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT HOWEVER UNDER THAT ORDER WE ALSO ALLOWED -- FACILITIES THAT DO YOU HAVE A COMPLETE YOU TAKING FUEL FROM HIGH HAZARD AREAS -- TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PRICE FOR THOSE FACILITIES COULD CONTINUE TO RATCHET UP -- WHILE THE BIOMASS FACILITIES ARE MEETING THEIR TARGETS TODAY -- BASED ON STATEMENTS FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES ON AND SOME ESTIMATES THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED BY -- I THINK BOTH ON CAL FIRE IN THE NATIONAL FOREST SERVICE ON WE SEE A NUMBER CHALLENGES IN A MEETING THIS TARGETS IN BEING ABLE TO GET THE FUEL TO THE BIOMASS FACILITIES. ON OVER THE NEXT YEARS AND OVER THE LONG TERM ON SOME OF THOSE -- CHALLENGING A BIDDING KNOWLEDGES ARE ON I'D THIS AND BY NO MEANS A COMPREHENSIVE LIST BUT COMPETITION FOR LIMITED AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE HIGH HAZARD WOULD OUT THERE. ON EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A LOT OF ON DIDN'T DYING TREES OUT THERE THE AMOUNT OF WOOD THAT'S ACTUALLY ACCESSIBLE CAN BE TRUCKED IN THESE FACILITIES IS STILL SOMEWHAT LIMITED. ON CHALLENGES AND FINDING A CONSISTENT SUPPLY OF HIGH HAZARD WOULD -- ONLY BEING ABLE TO REMOVE THE TREES IN SPRING AND SUMMER -- YOUNG SO IF THERE FUEL AND IT'S ONLY AND LOG ON TO REMOVE INSERT. YEAR A THE PLANTS HAVE TO FIND OTHER FUEL SOURCES OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR -- LACK OF ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET SAID SOME OF THE IMPACT AREAS LACK OF SUFFICIENT RESOURCES SUCH AS TRUCKS TO MOVE THEM TO THE BIOMASS FACILITIES -- AND THEN IF THE TREE REMOVAL IS INCREASED -- OVER THE LEVELS IT'S NOW A LACK OF SUFFICIENT STORAGE SPACE FOR THE TO STORE THE WOOD WHILE TRYING OUT BEFORE CAN BE USED FOR BIOENERGY. ANOTHER CHALLENGE FACING MISTER IN THE YOU CAN YOU START TO BRING YOUR PRESENTATION DR JUST CLOSING UP RIGHT NOW -- GIVEN THAT THESE CHALLENGES -- GIVEN THESE CHALLENGES -- THERE ARE -- CONCERNS IT'S SIMPLY INCREASING TARGETS ARE MANDATES FOR BIOMASS PLANTS WILL NOT ACTUALLY HELP REMOVE THE FUEL FOR THE FORCE -- CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS INSTEAD OF RD PAIN A PREMIUM FOR THE BIOMASS PROJECTS COMPARED TO OTHER RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND THIS PREMIUM MAY ACTUALLY BE JUSTIFIED GIVEN THE SOCIETAL COST -- INVOLVED HERE -- BUT IF THEY ARE PLAYING THE PREMIUM WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE -- THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY MEETING THOSE GOALS ALL SORTS. ON IN SO ITIT SEEMS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IS NEEDED -- BEYOND JUST DIRECTING UTILITIES -- TO TO PROCURE MORE RESOURCES AND WITHOUT OFFICE. THANK YOU -- BECAUSE OF PURCHASE HOLDEN AND DIED AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS JOHN I THINK YOU SAW AND I DIRECT TO SEE OUR INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNITY AND ENVIRONMENT. AYE WE'VE BEEN IN OPERATION SINCE ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY THREE WERE A NONPROFIT. ORGANIZATION. AND WE WORK WITH GROUPS ALL OVER THE STATE -- SOME OF THE COLLABORATIVE GROUPS THAT ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT AND TRYING TO ADDRESS. A LARGE LANDSCAPE SOME UPWARDS OF A MILLION ACRES -- AND THAT'S NOT THE NATURE OF MY DISCUSSION HERE TODAY BUT IT IS CRITICAL IN DEALING WITH SOME OF THESE LARGE LANDSCAPE ISSUES -- WE ALSO HAVE -- PAYROLL THIS SUMMER MANY OF WHOM ARE -- HIGH SCHOOL KIDS FROM URBAN AREAS AND URBAN AIR OUT RURAL AREAS WERE BRINGING THEM TOGETHER TO DO RESTORATION WORK IN OUR FORESTS A LOT OF THAT WORK IS TAKING PLACE IN. THE STATE WATERSHED CRITICAL SO OF THE UPPER FEATHER RIVER -- THEY'RE DOING SOME AMAZING THINGS UP THERE -- A FEW YEARS AGO TO SERIOUS TO PROCEED TO TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO BUILD A BIOMASS POWER COGENERATION FACILITY TO PROVIDE HEAT AND POWER. PLUMAS COUNTIES NORTHERN PLUMAS COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUILDING -- A SECOND BIOMASS BOILERS BEING DEVELOPED FOR A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL ANOTHER BY A MASS BOILERS BEING CONSIDERED FOR A LOCAL JAIL. THEY DON'T USE A LOT BUT THEY USE MATERIAL IN THEY BURNED IN ANY IN A CONFINED SPACE AND AS ALREADY MENTIONED. IT IS A CLEAN WAY OF UTILIZING THIS MATERIAL -- ON TOP OF THAT WE BUILT THIS IS NOT MY SUITCASE THIS IS CROSSED LAMINATED TIMBER. ARE ALSO MORE GENERICALLY KNOWN AS MASS TIMBER WE BUILT THE FIRST FULL. ACROSS LIMITED TIMBER STRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT HOUSES ONE OF THE BIOMASS SPOILERS FOR THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUILDING THIS WAS COMPLETED WITH A RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR -- AND THAT JUST CONSTRUCTION PROJECT CONTRIBUTED OVER A MILLION DOLLARS TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY. SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT. UP THIS MORNING I SPENT THREE THREE AND A HALF HOURS IN JACKSON I'M A SOCIAL SCIENTIST BY TRAINING. A LETTER WORKSHOP TALKING ABOUT COMMUNITY CAPACITY COMMUNITY HEALTH AND WELL BEING. AND THE CONVERSATION WAS FASCINATING BECAUSE THIS IS THE SAME AREA WHERE. THREE YEARS AGO THE BUTTE FIRE BURNED. SCARS REMAIN AND I MEAN NOT JUST ON THE LANDSCAPE THE SCARS REMAIN FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THE ANGUISH THE ECONOMIC. AYE DEVASTATION EXIST STILL TODAY IT WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSION THIS MORNING -- MY BACKYARD IS A MENTION PLUMAS COUNTY NORTHERN SIERRA -- THE MOONLIGHT FIRE BURNED THERE JUST ABOUT ELEVEN YEARS AGO I THOUGHT THAT FIRE IS A VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER SCARED THE HECK OUT OF ME OUT THERE AS I WAS DRIVING A TANKER TRUCK -- PROVIDING WATER FOR SOME OF THE FRONTLINE ENGINES AND I REMEMBER THEM FROM BEING ST BERNARD DO YOU KNOW. ARIZONA AND ELSEWHERE UNFORTUNATELY THAT FIRE WAS CONSIDERED SMALL BY TODAY'S STANDARDS ON HUNDRED SQUARE MILES. BUT WHAT WAS UNIQUE TO THAT FIRE WAS THAT IT WAS A HIGH SEVERITY BURNED RELATIVE TO SOME OF THE AREAS OVER 60% OF THAT LANDSCAPE HAD A HIGH SEVERITY BURN. THE IMPLICATIONS AT THE RIM FIRE BY THE WAY WAS 40% IN CONTRAST. BUT WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED SINCE THEN SO ELEVEN YEARS AGO WITH DROUGHT WITH CLIMATE CHANGE -- WE NOW HAVE WE BEEN LOOKING AT A BROWN LANDSCAPE FOR A LONG TIME. BUT WHAT WE'VE ALSO LEARNED IS WHAT WAS OLD FOREST. 40% 44% OLD FORCES NOW SHRUBLAND. WE WILL NOT SEE FOR US BACK THERE NOT IN MY LIFETIME NO MATTER WHAT WE DO -- I WANT TO SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY. AND SPECIFICALLY ABOUT AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN ASSEMBLY. MEMBER AGRIC CURRY WHICH IS -- THE BILL CALLING. FOR INNOVATIVE FOREST PRODUCTS -- TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN CALLS FOR ADVANCING -- ON MASK MASK TIMBER. CONSTRUCTION IN SOME LOCATIONS -- IT CALLS FOR SOME OTHER FACILITIES AND THESE ARE IMPORTANT IT IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO UTILIZE. NOT JUST BIOMASS MORE MATERIAL BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE IS SMALL MATERIAL THAT'S A PART OF THIS. SO IT CAN BE USED IN A PRODUCT THAT IS QUITE VALUABLE. WE BY THE WAY IN BUILDING THE BUILDING FOR THE BOILER SPENT ALL OF TWO DAYS INSTRUCTING. AND THAT'S THE VALUE IN TERMS OF REDUCE LABOR AND THIS BY THE WAY IS A BIG PIECE OF CARBON. COMPARE -- TO STEEL -- A TIME. OF THIS MATERIAL COMPARED TO STEAL. STEEL AMIDST TWENTY TIMES TWENTY ONE TIMES THE CARBON IN ITS MANUFACTURE CEMENT [inaudible] EIGHT TIMES THE CARBON SO THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT THE CARBON DICK REGROWS ON THE LANDSCAPE. AS THE FOREST AS WHAT WAS TAKEN OUT IN THE FOREST RECOVERS THERE SO WE HAVE CARBON. ADDED ON THE LANDSCAPE. UMP THE IMPORTANCE AS I WRAP UP. CALIFORNIA'S LAGGING IN THIS IT UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN OR AGAIN. PUT IN PLACE THE ICC THE INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL STANDARDS IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE VOTING ON THIS FALL. THEY ALREADY PUT IN PLACE BEFORE THAT VOTE TOOK PLACE WASHINGTON BILL FIVE MASS TIMBER SKILL OUR SCHOOLS. RIGHT AWAY THEY'VE DECIDED TO DO THAT ALABAMA MAIN ILLINOIS. BROUGHT IN CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER FACILITIES VERY RECENTLY. WE CAN'T DO BETTER WE GOT THIS MATERIAL WE HAD TO GET FROM CANADA. FOR THE BUILDING THAT WE CONSTRUCTED [inaudible] SO LASTLY. WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED TO DO? I WANT TO MENTION ONE THING IS A SOCIAL SCIENTIST WE TALK ABOUT LANDSCAPE NEEDS. AND THERE ARE MANY. BUT TO BE EFFECTIVE DOING THE WORK ON THE LANDSCAPE WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE PLACES TO BRING THAT MATERIAL. TO WE HAVE TO REBUILD SOME OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE LOST OVER THE YEARS THAT'S A CRITICAL DIMENSION. OF THE PROBLEM WE FACE AS A STATE SO AGAIN THE LANDSCAPE ISSUES ARE ABSOLUTELY REAL WE KNOW THEM FIRSTHAND BUT TO DEAL WITH THAT. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE FACILITIES THAT WILL UTILIZE THIS MATERIAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. AND IF NEW CHAIRS AND MEMBERS THE PERSON I'M NOT CATHOLIC PHILIP SHAREDA PERSONAL MATTER TO TEND -- TO BUT DANIEL AND I WAS FEELING IT -- WILL BE FILLING IN FOR HER -- AGAIN -- I'M ANY MORENO -- WITH URKEL CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAVE AN ACTIVE THAT CAMPAIGN TO THWART EFFORTS BY THE BY MASS INDUSTRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CLIMATE IMPACTS IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY -- EXPAND THE POLLUTING INDUSTRY AGAIN WITH ME IS DANA VARADA LEAD ORGANIZER ON THE CAMPAIGN. WILL NOW PROVIDE TESTIMONY ABOUT WHY BY MASS INCINERATION IS NOT A SOLUTION TO TREAT MORTALITY WILDFIRES WERE ENERGY NEED. PICK DOT ORG THANK GOD THANK YOU THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. I WANT TO BE BEGAN BY SAYING THAT I FEEL DEEPLY FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHO WERE EVACUATED OR WORSE YOU HAVE LOST HOMES AND NOT ONCE. I GREW UP IN COLORADO AND WAS EVACUATED FOR THE WHILE THOUGH CANYON FIRE. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT NOTHING IS MORE HORRIFYING THAN DRIVING AWAY FROM HER HOME. NOT KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT AGAIN. BUT A VISCERAL FEAR FIRE HOWEVER JUSTIFIED CANNOT KEEP US FROM HAVING A ROBUST INFORMED DISCUSSION ABOUT FIRE FIRE MANAGEMENT AND BIOMASS UTILIZATION. THERE ARE A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD TREES AND CALIFORNIA'S FOREST. HOWEVER NOT ALL A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES SHUT OR EVEN CAN BE REMOVED WE HEARD FROM THE CPUC. ABOUT HOW. VERY FEW OF THESE TREES ARE ACTUALLY ACCESSIBLE. MANY OF THESE TREES ARE IN REMOTE AREAS AND ACCESSING THAT WOULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE AN ECOLOGICALLY DESTRUCTIVE. ACCORDING TO A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE BY YOU SEE BY THE UC EXTENSION TO THE MENDOCINO FIRE SAFE COUNCIL IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FIRE PATHWAYS ARE NOT DRIVEN BY TREE MORTALITY NOR IS TO IMMORTALITY AT THE HEART OF FIRE ACTIVITY IN THE WEST. ALL THAT SAID THERE ARE DEAD TREES THAT ARE IN DANGER FALLING ON HOMES POWERLINES ROADS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS TREES THAT NEED TO BE REMOVED FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE. THESE TREES ARE TRULY HAZARDOUS AND MUST BE REMOVED THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT DO WE DO WITH THESE TREES AND ALSO WHAT SHOULD WE NOT DO WITH THEM. CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT USE HATTER HAZARDOUS TREES TO PROP UP A POLLUTING AND NON ECONOMIC BIOMASS INCINERATION INDUSTRY. ON AVERAGE BIOMASS AND SAID FACILITIES AND IT. THREE TIMES MORE CO TWO PER MEGAWATT THE NATURAL GAS AND ONE AND A HALF TIMES MORE THAN EVEN CALL. BIOMASS INCINERATORS FOR LEASE FINE PARTICULATES AND KNOCKS IN HIGH CONCENTRATIONS. BOTH OF WHICH ARE LINKED. TO HEART AND LUNG CONDITIONS. MANY OF THESE FACILITIES INCLUDING ONE THAT IS CURRENTLY DO BURNING DEAD FOREST TREES ON AT BIO RAM CONTRACT. ARE LOCATED IN THE SAN JOAQUIN FROM SCHOOLS AND NEIGHBORHOODS AND THESE FACILITIES ARE BURNING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. CALIFORNIA SHOULD THINK OF BIOMASS UTILIZATION AS A HIERARCHY OF THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE FOR TREES. WHEN POSSIBLE A TREE CAN REMAIN A TREE EVEN SOME DEAD TREES PROVIDE INNUMERABLE ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS AND SEQUESTER CARBON? THEN WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE UTILIZATION THAT SEQUESTERS CARBON. BURNING TREES AND POWER PLANTS NEXT TO SCHOOLS AND IN NEIGHBORHOODS SHOULD NOT BE OUR SHOULD BE OUR VERY LAST CHOICE FOR BIOMASS UTILIZATION. NOT THE FIRST. WE MUST PRIORITIZE RESEARCH AND WE CANNOT KEEP INCINERATORS ONLINE AND SIMPLY SAYING THEY'RE SAYING THERE'S TOO MUCH WASTE. TO DEAL WITH. WE NEED EXTENSIVE RESEARCH INTO HOW MUCH WASTE THERE ACTUALLY IS IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THEN WHEN POSSIBLE AND PERMITTING COMMUNITY SCALE. BIOMASS UTILIZATION EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING TO THAT SEQUESTER AS MUCH CARBON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU -- WILL. I THINK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS ALL TURNED -- TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE STIR CALLING. SO I LIKE TO ASK YOU WHAT. THE FROM SIERRA CLUB WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST I TELL MY CONSTITUENTS HER BREATHE IN SMOKE EVERYDAY RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS THE SOLUTION IF WE DON'T WANNA? THEN ARE WE DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING WHO'S OR WALK AWAY FROM THE WHAT IS WHAT IS A AS I ONCE WAS A TOWN JUST GET THIS IS THE NEW NORMAN. WE WE'VE SEQUESTERED FIRE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS THAT'S NOT NORMAL. FIRE NOW ACTUALLY BURNED EVERY TEN TO TWELVE YEARS THE SCIENTISTS IS SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE WILL TELL YOU THAT. I'M NOT A SCIENTIST I BELIEVE THEIR RESEARCH BUT WE HAVE HISTORY THAT TREE MARKINGS SAY. FORCED BURNED EVERY TEN TO TWELVE YEARS WE STOP THAT MAN STOP THAT PROCESS. KIM PIMLOTT SPENT. THREE ALMOST THREE BILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR FIGHTING FIRES TO STOP THAT PROCESS WHAT IS THE SOLUTION. FIRST OF ALL I ON ONE AT BEGAN BY SAYING -- THAT. IT IS IMPORTANT. TO TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND PROTECT TOWNS AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT. WOULD LIKE THE LEGISLATURE TO PRIORITIZE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND PRIORITIZE HARDENING OF HOMES ADDITIONALLY. I'M WHILE. IT IS A JARRING TO SEE ALL THE SMOKE AND I'M SURE IT'S STRONG FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AND IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WHERE THERE ARE SIX BIOMASS FACILITIES CURRENTLY OPERATING. THEY HAVE THAT KIND OF AIR QUALITY EVERYDAY. AND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR. AND IF WE CONTINUE [inaudible] BURNING -- TAKING THE WASTE FROM THE SIERRAS AND BURNING IT DOWN ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I'M NOT THINK THAT'S VERY FAIR TO THAT ON CONSTITUENTS AND THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SO YOUR SUGGESTION WOULD BE THE END OPEN BURN. THAT'S ALSO AND CRACKED AND I DO NOT THINK IT'S VERY FAIR TO COMPARE THE EMISSIONS OF THE BIOMASS INCINERATOR TO THAT. ON OPEN BURNING OR FOREST FIRE THAT'S THAT'S THESE UTILIZATION CONVERSATIONS THAT I THINK ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AT THE GOVERNOR ALLOCATED ON TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. TO THAT SET THE BAR EXTREMELY LOW FOR THOSE UTILIZATION CON I CONVERSATIONS IF WE JUST SAY. WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE BIOMASS UTILIZATION THAT IS CLEANER THAN FOREST FIRES IN OPEN BURNING. THAT CANNOT BE THE SOLUTION. SO I THINK WE NEED TO AGAIN PRIORITIZE RESEARCH PRIORITIZE INNOVATION AND IF WE PROP UP BIOMASS FACILITIES FOR THE END UNFORESEEABLE FUTURE WE'LL NEVER GET TO A REALITY. WHERE WE HAVE CLEAN ALTERNATIVES THAT TO BUY MASS INCINERATION? WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I JUST WANNA SAY REALITY IS IT'S BURDEN. AND IT'S GONNA OPEN BURN WHETHER WE DO ANYTHING OR NOT AND HAD IT IT'S LIKE. TO ME OBAMA'S PLANET. IS A GIANT MOUSE ON A FORCE FIRE YOU JUST TAKE IT OUT AND PUT IT IN THERE AND YOU ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE DO WITH. COMBUSTIBLE ENGINES WE PUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY ON A SO WE REDUCE. THE EMISSIONS THAT COME OUT SO I FIND IT REALLY FASCINATING THAT TIME. HERE WE CAN WE CAN SIT HERE AND AND AND AND HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WE TALK ABOUT STREAMLINING PROCESS WE TALK ABOUT TRYING TO ACTUALLY PROACTIVELY. AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY OF COME TO SOME SORT OF A SOLUTION TO SOMETHING THAT MAN CREATED. AND WE CREATED THIS SITUATION BY EXTINGUISHING FIRE THAT NOW ACTUALLY. SEND OUT A LOT OF THIS BIOMASS SO -- WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE A SOLUTION OTHER THAN JUST GOING BACK TO THE SAME THING WHEN I ASKED THE QUESTION THAT WE CAN'T HAVE. THIS BIOMASS PLANT IN THE CENTRAL ALLEY WHETHER THERE ARE MANY SHATTERED PLANTS ALL OVER THE STATE THAT ARE. NOT IN USE THAT WE COULD USE THIS MATERIAL AND AS A SHORT TERM AT LEAST PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE FOR THE SHORT TERM UNTIL WE COME UP WITH WHATEVER THAT SOLUTION IS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME THAT. I HAVE HEARD A SOLUTION BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE A LEASE SOMETHING I KNOW WORKS TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR DUCKS. YEAH THANK YOU ARM I AM. I THINK THE MESSAGE WAS THAT THIS. MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THAT ANSWER. AND I TO SHARE CONCERNED THAT I WANT AN ANSWER. WE NEED ANSWERS BOB BIOMASS IS SOMETHING THEY HAVE USED -- IN THE PAST IT'S PRESENTED AS AN OPTION -- I WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT ITS COST AND A LITTLE A CONCERNED AS WELL ABOUT -- ITS EMISSIONS. IF IT EMITS MORE THAN NATURAL GAS AND ONE AND A HALF TIMES -- MORE THAN -- COAL FOR ITS PRODUCTION. THAT WORRIES ME BUT I THINK. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS SOME ANSWERS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE PROBLEMS AND I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK? IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO OTHER DISCUSSIONS WE HAD EARLIER THERE ARE SOME ANSWERS -- WE DO NEED TO HARDEN OUR HOMES -- AND WE DO NEED TO BRING OUR BEST AND OUR BRIGHTEST PEOPLE TOGETHER. TO TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THOSE OPTIONS AND PUT THEM INTO PLACE. AND I AGREE THAT FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS WE'VE HAD A PHILOSOPHY IN THIS STATE THAT SAYS THE BURNING IS NOT THE ANSWER. WE NOW FIND OURSELVES WITH FOR MORE BURN A BULL COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL THAN WE HAD EXPECTED AND A CLIMATE CHANGE WHERE. THE AVERAGE HUMIDITY FOR THE CURRENT FIRES HAS BEEN ADDED I'M TOLD 5%. THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY NUMBERS SO WE HAVE. ZERO THAT'S NEVER BEEN SO DRY WE HAVE AIR THAT'S NEVER BEEN SO DRY WE HAVE HUNDRED MILE AN HOUR WINDS. WE ARE EXPERIENCING SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK WE ANTICIPATED FIFTY YEARS AGO -- BUT WE HEAR. AND I THINK I IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE DID HAVE -- SOME DISCUSSION I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RESEARCH AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND WHILE THOSE ARE HELPFUL AND HOPEFULLY THEIR NEW TECHNOLOGIES COMING ABOUT EVERY DAY THAT WILL -- HELP US MOVE FORWARD -- THE IDEA TO YOU TALK ABOUT PRIORITIZING DEFENSIBLE SPACE PRIORITIZING AND HARDENING ARE HOMES AND I THINK THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS -- AND WE AND THOSE ARE PRIORITIES TO THAT -- I AM HOPEFUL. THAT WE ARE NOW BRINGING TOGETHER THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST PEOPLE FROM A LOT OF THE LEGISLATIVE -- PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME FROM -- COLLEAGUES OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS SOME THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED IN THE SENATE -- WORKING WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY COMPETENCY OF OUR CAL FIRE PEOPLE NOT ONLY IN FIGHTING FIRES BUT ALSO IN WORKING TO PREVENT THEM SO. I APPRECIATE THE PROPOSAL HERE I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS EXCITES ME AS I'D HOPED. GIVEN THE DOWNSIDES TO IT AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE INDEED A LOT OF THESE TREES WERE NEVER GOING TO GET TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES SOME OF THEM IN OBSCURE AREAS. I LOVE THE IDEA BOB PERHAPS EXPANDING OUR CONSERVATION CORPS. AND HAVING A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE -- HELPING US I'M NOT SURE THOUGH -- THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK IT UP BUT THAT THERE'S NO ONE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS. CONSIDER ALL THE OPTIONS AND THEN I WANT TO THANK A IN SPITE OF THE FACT THERE ARE TWO NEW WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN HERE AND I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WHETHER IT'S IN OUR FIRE AGENCIES OR OF TALK. TO ACHIEVE PIMLOTT ABOUT THAT ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION I CAN ASSURE YOU -- WE REALLY DO NEED TO BRING TOGETHER THE GREAT IDEAS AT US OTHER STATES HAVE DONE TAKE A LOOK AT THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US IN CALIFORNIA. THEN TAKE THE SCIENCE IN THE EXPERTISE AND MOVE THIS BALL FORWARD OUTGOING FOR NOW I WOULD LIKE -- THAT THE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION AND SOLUTION AS WELL. SO WITH THAT I I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THOSE THOUGHTS. NO DISRESPECT FOR ALYSSA PROTECTS TAKES TO BEAUTY EQUAL ONE CATHERINE PHILLIPS THROUGH ITS -- FIRST BY POACHERS I'D STEPPED OUT SO IF THIS WAS ANSWERED MY APOLOGIES BUT QUESTION ABOUT IS HERE -- IS THERE ANY DATA ABOUT THE LEVEL OF ADMISSIONS FROM BIOMASS VERSES OPEN BURNING I THINK. MISS I THINK SOMEBODY MAY HAVE ALLUDED TO THAT. YEAH I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THE QUESTION -- IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF DIRECT COMBUSTION THAT HAS EMISSIONS CONTROL EQUIPMENT AND WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT. GASIFICATION PROCESS SEE SOME OF THOSE ARE EVEN CLEANER. SO IT'S CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S THERE'S A HUNDRED TIMES. DIFFERENCE AND SO THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE TALK OUGHT TO BIOMASS OR NOT MASS I HOPE WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE WE ALSO ARE TALKING ABOUT. OTHER PRODUCTS THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHERE WE'RE TAKING SMALL MATERIAL WE CAN MAKE POLLS WE CAN MAKE OTHER MATERIALS AND THEN WERE WERE ACTUALLY. DEVELOPING VALUE ADDED PRODUCTS WHICH CREATE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES CREATE WORK OPPORTUNITIES ALL FOREST WASTE IS NOT WASTE. IT CAN BE USED IN DIFFERENT WAYS CHIPS ARE JUST ONE WAY AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE SOME BIOMASS OPPORTUNITIES A SERIOUS STUDENTS LOOKING AT THAT. AS ARE MANY OTHER -- OF OUR PARTNERS SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT PROCESSES AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE WE ARE NOW ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF BIOMASS FACILITIES. TO ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT THE BY ON THAT PROCESS AND THE ELEVEN TWENTY TWO PROJECTS THAT ARE COMING ON SO. BIOMASS BIOMASS BOILERS FAR FAR CLEANER THAN JUST OPEN FILE BERNIE. THIS EPISODE REMEMBER WOULD GIVE IT MIGHT -- CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. PUTS IT SIMPLY THIS WAY. BIOMASS ENERGY IS 98% LESS POLLUTING THAN WILD FIRE OR CONTROLLED BURNS. IF I COULD. QUALIFY TO THROUGH THINGS HERE JUST TO NOTE SO ONE THING YOU NOTED THERE WAS MUCH CLEANER IS GASIFICATION -- BUT WE ARE RIGHT NOW TALKING ABOUT GASIFICATION OF THE FUEL WERE TALKING ABOUT TAKING THE FUEL PUTTING IN A TRUCK IN SHIPPING -- I I DO THINK A LOT OF ARE AND DO YOU NEED TO BE DONE AROUND GASIFICATION ON MOST OF THE COST OF SHIPPING BIOMASS IS ACTUALLY SHIPPING WATER THE WOOD HAS LOTS OF WATER IN A THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT. COMBUSTION EVER BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE WEIGHT OF THAT THE MORE WE CAN DO RESEARCH. TO REDUCE THOSE COSTS -- THE MORE YOU'RE GONNA LOWER THE OVERALL COST OF THE BIOMASS IN POTENTIALLY THE OVERALL MISSION -- MOSTLY NOW SAYS INACTION NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT -- A HEARTBEAT DID. TOO ASSUMED FOR THE TRUCKING BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS WE'VE DONE ON GHG EMISSIONS -- LOOKING AT IT COMPARED TO OTHER RENEWABLE OR OTHER ON ENERGY RESOURCES -- WHICH IS DIFFERENT. BUT ONCE YOU GET BEYOND TWENTY TO THIRTY MILES OF SHIFTING THE ADMISSIONS FROM THE TRUCKING GET SO HIGH. THAT THAT STARTS TO DRIVE IT OUT SO IF WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS IS BIOMASS IS A SOLUTION FOR GHG WE ALSO HAVE TO FOCUS ON BIOMASS BEING CLOSE TO THE FUEL SOURCE AND NOT LONG -- TRUCK. BUT IF I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK I THINK I THINK WE RECOGNIZE WE RECOGNIZE THAT AS WELL BUT BUT SHOULD WE NOT I MEAN LOOK I AM NOT LOOKING AT BIOMASS AS THE SAVIOR FOR THE ENERGY INDUSTRY HERE OKAY. I'M NOT NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THAT BUT WE HAVE A DISPOSAL ISSUE FOR GOING TO BE DOING MANAGEMENT. SO IF WE DO NOT CREATE USE IT FOR AT THROUGH THROUGH THE PILE TO BIOMASS AS AN ENERGY SOURCE. AND WE LEAVE IT IN THE FOREST IT'S STILL RELEASES METHANE WHICH IS A SHORT TERM POP CLIMATE POLLUTANTS SO SO. YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT HAD WE YOU KNOW WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT ALL THE NUMBERS HERE TO REALLY FIND OUT FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WHAT'S REALLY REALLY COST EFFICIENT -- IN YOU MENTIONED YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING THAT YOU AND I APOLOGIZE I WAS TRYING TO FOLLOW YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. THE THREE MEGAWATTS A FIVE MEGAWATT BIOMASS PLANTS AND AND ST YOU TALK ABOUT STEVE'S ABOUT STREAMLINING. THINGS. YEAH THERE'S THERE'S TWO THINGS IN THEIR ONE AND I THINK IF YOU'RE WELL AWARE -- THERE IS LEGISLATION -- FOR THE BIO MAT PROGRAM TO MOVE THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM'S FROM THREE MEGAWATTS FROM THREE MEG WHAT THE FIVE MEGAWATT. ON THAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED ON FOR BIO MAP FACILITIES -- YET THEY NOW CAN BE UP TO FIVE MEGAWATTS INCISORS A RESTRICTION ON HOW MUCH THEY CAN EXPORT TO THE GRID. ON BY STATUTE BUT THE FACILITY ITSELF CAN BE FIVE MEGAWATTS INSIDE THE OTHER STREAMLINING ISSUE [inaudible] I'M IS. ONGOING AND LEAST AND IN MY WORLD SEEMING ALMOST NEVER ENDING IS THE STREAMLINING OF THE INTERCONNECTION. I MEAN THIS IS A TRUE JUST FOR BIOMASS IT'S TRUE -- FOR ALL SMALLER DISTRIBUTED GENERATION OUT THERE THAT THE INTERCONNECTION PROCESS TO THE GRADE -- IS UNSOPHISTICATED DEVELOPERS HAVEN'T BEEN IN THEENERGY -- INDUSTRY FOR A LONG TIME CAN BE VERY COMPLICATED -- AND HAS A LOT OF STEPS TO IT IN A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN SO THEY CAN YOU SEE FOR MANY YEARS NOW HAS BEEN TAKING. YEAH STEPS THROUGH YOUR FIRST TRYING TO FIND COMPROMISES AMONG ALL THE PARTIES TO STREAMLINE IT AND NOW MOVING MORE -- TO NO TOUGHER DECISIONS OUT THERE WE'VE ALSO ADDED STAFF I THINK THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR FOR GIVING US MORE STAFF WHO ARE FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON INTERCONNECTION INTERCONNECTION DISPUTE RESOLUTION. ON SO THAT WE CAN BETTER ON NAVIGATE WHEN THERE ARE THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTIONS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THE SMALLER FACILITIES ARE GOING TO FACE -- BECAUSE IF THEY'RE CLOSE TO THE FUEL SOURCE ARE USUALLY NOT CLOSE -- TO ROBUST DISTRIBUTION SAYS. IT'S IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS TO INTERCONNECT AND THAT'S IN THE YOU KNOW -- TWO TO THREE MILLION DOLLAR RANGE FOR THE INTERCONNECTIONS AND THAT CAN DRIVE. THAT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE OF THESE PROJECTS BEEN PROFITABLE. WHEN I GO BACK TO A COMMENT MADE IN EARLY HEARING IN A WEEK WE HAD A VERY SMALL BUILD TWEAK PART OF THE SYSTEM? FORCED WAITS ON STREAMLINING IS IT WHILE IT WAS THE WAY TO YEARS FOR THE RAGS ON THAT SO. I'M LOOKING FOR THE MORE. STREAMLINING. QUITE FRANKLY YEAH ON ONE THING I CAN SAY ON THAT IS THE THE PIECE OF THE BILL THAT YOU'RE LOOKING BACK ON IMPLEMENTED VERY QUICKLY -- WE ALSO GOT CAUGHT IN A FEDERAL LAWSUIT UNRELATED TO THE BIO MAT PROGRAM -- AND THAT -- ON P. YOU SEE WHICH SUIT ON A PROGRAM IT'S CALLED REMAPPED -- THAT THE FEDERAL COURT LOOKED AT IN THIS TOOK MANY YEARS TO MOVE THROUGH FOR IN THE FEDERAL COURTS AND US AND VERY RECENTLY LAST DECEMBER FEDERAL COURT AND SAN FRANCISCO SAID. STATES REMAPPED PROGRAM VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW. IN ISSUED AN ORDER AGAINST US TO STOP ALL CONTRACTS UNDER THAT PROGRAM. THE CHALLENGE WE FACE IS THE BIO MAT PROGRAM IN STATUTE IS 1100% BASED ON THE REMATCH. SO THAT THEN CAUSED US TO HAVE TO STOP AND GO SLOWLY AND MOVE FORWARD VERY SLOWLY FOR A COUPLE MONTHS TO AVOID FUTURE LITIGATION. ON THE BIO MAT PROGRAM NOW I THINK WE'RE AT THE POINT NOW WHERE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BY ON THAT PROGRAM WHICH SEPARATED ENOUGH FROM THE WE MAP OF RAM -- BUT IT DID CREATE -- A BIG BECAUSE IT THE COMMISSION ON A NUMBER OF THINGS WE WERE TRYING TO DO IN THE EARLY PART OF THIS YEAR -- MY FINAL QUESTION JUST OF THIS YEAR SIERRA CLUB FOLKS. IS THE ENVIRONMENT OTHER IS ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY FLATLY OPPOSED TO BIOMASS [inaudible] BORIS. UP I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. UP THAT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE IS ON LARGE SCALE ESPECIALLY NATIONALLY -- LARGE SCALE OPPOSITION. TO OUT BY A MASS INCINERATION AND AND IN FACT THAT LIKE I MENTIONED THE CENTRAL VALLEY AIR QUALITY COALITION HAD A LOBBY DAY. I JUST A WEEK AGO AND THIS IS ONE OF THEIR KEY ISSUES THAT THEY BROUGHT INTO -- TO LEGISLATOR SO IT'S DEFINITELY A CONCERN [inaudible] ARMONK. VAST SWATHS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY [inaudible] OKAY -- OKAY THANK YOU I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAYBE DRIVE NORTH AND SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TWENTY MILES FROM HERE AND KEEP GOING. SEE WHAT FORCE FIRES ARE DOING AND THANK YOU [inaudible] MISSOURI'S. SO I LOOKED HER. I JUST WISH THAT I I DO WANT TO COMMENT THAT THE CHIEF -- PIMLOTT. THE THINGS HE MENTIONED. WAS THAT FIRE PREVENTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS OR BY MAIL PROTECTIONS. ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. AND I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT OTHERS A LONG HISTORY OF NOT JUST THIS YEAR CLUB BUT MANY OF THE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE'S BREATHING WE ARE DEALING WITH SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT NOW AND WE DO HAVE TO RE EVALUATE? ALL OF THE DETAILS. I THINK THAT WE ARE CHARGED WITH MAKING DIFFICULT. SOLUTIONS IT DIFFICULT PROPOSALS. NOT PERFECT PROPOSALS. AND I I I I KNOW THAT IF WE WERE TO PUT TOGETHER PERFECT PROPOSALS. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WOULD BE ON THIS ON THIS. PART OF THIS GROUP SO I DO AGREE WITH THE CENTER JACKSON THAT. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE ALL STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE SO THE WE DISCUSS THESE ISSUES SO THAT. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS NOT? IT IS SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THAT HAS TO BE DEALT WITH AYE IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE. IN THE FOREST RATHER THAN HAVING TO TRANSPORT THE THE THE THE THE BIOMASS -- IF IT'S DONE WITHIN IT WITHIN THE AREA MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK AT THERE ARE LOTS OF LOTS OF POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR PERFECT SOLUTIONS. BUT WE DO HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE BEST SOLUTIONS TO TAKE CARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING US RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING SO SERIOUS AND WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR SOME SOLUTION [inaudible] THIS MAYES. I THINK HIS CHAIR OUT. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS ARE HERE IT'S INTERESTING WE HAVE OF ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE WITH ALL SCOTT FORCE YOU SAYS HE ASIAN. AND THERE'S SOME TALK EARLIER OF WHEN DOWN THAT CHIEF HIM UP THAT WHAT WHAT WAS HERE AND I KNOW THAT -- THAT -- SOME MEMBER DALY LEADER DALAI AHEAD ASK SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME BILLS THAT HE'S INTRODUCED OVER THE YEARS. AND WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE IS THERE. IS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT WE HAVE OVERGROWN FORESTS IN CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. DO DO YOU GUYS BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE OVERGROWN FORESTS IN IN CALIFORNIA. AGAIN -- I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. AND I AM MYSELF NOT A FOREST ECOLOGIST [inaudible] AND IT'S ALL THE OF THAT ANSWER AT THAT. BUT NO I I DON'T KNOW. SO. THE SIERRA CLUB DOESN'T TAKE A POSITION AT ALL IN REGARDS TO WHETHER WE HAVE OVERGROWN FOR SOME OF THE SIERRA CLUB. IS ONE OF THE MOST STORIED ADVOCACY IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO BOTH OUR PUBLIC LANDS ARE PRIVATE LANDS ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE SIERRA CLUB DOES NOT TAKE A POSITION. IN REGARDS TO WHETHER WE HAVE OVERGROWN FORESTS. AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING THAT -- I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT ON HOW WE SHOULD MANAGE THOSE FORESTS AND DEFINITELY WE NOW. WE AGREE THAT THERE ARE THERE'S BEEN YEARS AND YEARS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION THE FORCE ARE OVER GROUND I THINK SIERRA CLUB. WE TAKE A DIFFERENT LOOK AT ON FORCE MANAGEMENT FIRE MANAGEMENT BUT I'M THE BIOMASS ORGANIZER NOT A FORCE MANAGEMENT EXPERTS. IT DIDN'T AND OF COURSE THE REASON WHY I'M ASKING IS QUITE WISH WE HAD SOMEBODY COME FROM YOUR ORGANIZATIONALLY SOMEWHAT FROM ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY THEN THAT BOMB. FOR YEARS HAS BEEN ADVOCATING THAT WE DON'T TOUCH NAM ARE ARE ARE BOTH PUBLIC LANDS AND AND PRIVATE LANDS. WE HAVE PROBLEMS NOW BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THAT. YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS IN REGARDS TO THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM AND WE TALK ABOUT -- INVERSE CONDEMNATION WHICH WE'VE ALREADY HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. THE STATE TAKES SOME LIABILITY AS WELL IT'S NOT JUST CLIMATE CHANGE ALTHOUGH I DO THINK THAT WE DO HAVE A DIFFERENT CLIMATE TODAY AND I'VE I'M SOMEBODY AS A REPUBLICAN WHO BELIEVES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE. I'M ISRAEL AND WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO DEAL WITH -- WITH WITH DO WITH TO DEAL WITH THAT. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS THE FACT THE STATE. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AND IT COULD BE IT COULD BE THAT AS ELECTED OFFICIALS WE HAVEN'T HAD THE COURAGE TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP TO SOME FOLKS TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. SO THE QUESTION FOR ME IS ARE WE GOING TO TODAY STAND UP BECAUSE JUST LIKE DOCTOR WHAT TALKED ABOUT IN HIS DISTRICT HE'S GOT FOLKS. THAT HAVE FEARED FOR THEIR LIVES IF PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED HERE IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE OF OVERGROWN FORESTS AND IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT WE CAN'T COME TO FACT. WE CAN'T COME TO GRIPS WITH THE SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE SAYS THAT WE HAVE OVERGROWN FORCE IT WOULD BE GREAT. IT WOULD BE GREAT. IT WOULD BE GREAT AS A A AS A COMMUNITY AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE ALONG WITH OTHERS WOULD LOOK AT THE SCIENCE AND SAY. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH IT'S TIME TO START GETTING SOME OF THOSE FUELS OUT AND PART OF THE REASON I WANT TO POINT THIS OUT IS THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED TWENTY YOU SAID THIS A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION. DEAD TREES IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S A LOT INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES IT WOULD TAKE TO BE ABLE. TO THE CLEAR TO CLEAR THOSE. AND YET WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE DEAD AND DYING TREES BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T CLEARED ENOUGH WHAT DO YOU DO WITH ALL OF THAT. IT'S WASTE WHAT DO YOU DO WITH ALL OF THAT FUEL WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING WITH ITS OF BIOMASS ISN'T THE ANSWER. THEIR WHAT IS THE ANSWER WHAT WE EAT WHAT WE DO ABOUT THAT. AND AND I LET ME JUST SAY I THINK THAT. THOSE ARE ALL FAIR QUESTIONS I THINK THOUGH THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OUR PANELS ARE PUT TOGETHER WITH ADVOCATES FROM VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEWS AND AND SOME OF THEIR POSITIONS OR GOING TO BE SORT OF BASED ON THEIR THEIR PRISON AND HOW THEY SEE IT. HOW WE ULTIMATELY GET? S. WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD IS REALLY FOR US TO TAKE THE INFORMATION. AND THEN YIELD TO WHERE WE THINK IS THE BEST PATH. A TO ADDRESS. ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED BUT I I'M NOT. IF YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT YEAH I THINK I SHOULD TRY AND BY THE WAY MY EX WASN'T DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY AT ONE PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION I'M TALKING ABOUT US. OF COLLECTIVELY AND AND AND I THINK WE HAVE TO COME. TO THIS POINT IN TIME WHERE IT'S IT'S TIME FOR US TO STEP UP TO BE ABLE TO TO GET REALLY TO THE THE POINT AND RESOLVE THIS MATTER AND IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME COURAGE ON OUR SIDE. TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP TO SOMEBODY STAKEHOLDER GROUPS THAT DON'T HAVE A CHOICE IN THE MATTER BUT TO CONTINUE ON DOWN -- WITH THE POSITIONS THAT THEY HAD IT IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME COURAGE THRUSTS HER FOR POINT -- SENATOR JACKSON'S JUST A VERY QUICK VERY VERY SAID YESTERDAY ARE FINE AND SENATOR DODD WILL I HAVE A QUESTION CLOSE IT OUT AND GO RIGHT. TO THE PUBLIC COMES JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY THIS YEAR CLUB HAS TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF SB. TWELVE SIXTY SO THEY HAVE RECOGNIZED THE NEED -- TO COME TO A DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES AND THEY COME TO RECOGNIZE. THE NEED FOR THIS KIND OF FOR TREATMENT THEY MAY BE OPPOSED TO A SPECIFIC ISSUE AND I'M STILL NOT CLEAR ABOUT THAT. WHETHER IT'S A BLANKET OPPOSITION OR BASED UPON SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW TO MOVE IT FORWARD BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT. AND I HAVE. INTERVIEWED IN TALK TO VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM ARE IN SUPPORT OF THAT EFFORT. TO TO TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND TO RECOGNIZE IT'S NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION EVERYBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE A LITTLE SO I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT IF I MAY. OKAY I I'VE GOT A QUESTION. CENTER AYE I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT TODAY SO -- I HOPE WE GET MORE COOPERATION AND A MORE ARTICULATION OF WHAT THAT COOPERATION WHAT THOSE POTENTIAL PROGRAMS AND SOLUTIONS ARE TO THESE PROBLEMS. THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD AND DYING TREES OUT THERE I DON'T CARE HOW DAMN REMOTE THESE TREES ARE. WHEN WE GET DOWN TO ABOUT THIRTY MILLION MAYBE ALL BE -- PLUS WITH THE THE THOUGHT THAT WE CAN'T POSSIBLY GET THE LAST THIRTY MILLION. BUT THAT TO DO NOTHING ON THIS. AND USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHY WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS IS KIND OF MIND BLOWING TO MAY. AND THEN FINALLY I LIKE TO SEE SOME STUDIES DONE THE CENTRAL VALLEY'S AIR QUALITY SIXTY DAYS IN A ROW WHAT IS THAT BEEN LIKE DOWN THERE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WHAT IS THAT REALLY ME. WERE I IT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT YOU KNOW THAT THE REALITY WITH THIS NEW NORMAL WHAT EVERYBODY'S BREATHING PRACTICALLY IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'VE GOT TO COME TO GRIPS WITH A LOT OF THESE -- REALLY SERIOUS PROBLEMS ENVIRONMENTALLY FOR SOCIAL DIED. IT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES I GET THAT BUT NOW IF IT APPLIES TO EVERYBODY NOT JUST THOSE. COMMUNITIES WERE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND THAT. AND I THINK TO SENATOR JACKSON'S EARLIER POINT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF IT IS. TO EVERYBODY TO COME TOGETHER SO THAT I REALLY WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANEL MEMBERS TODAY THANK YOU FOR TAKING YOUR TIME. IN BEING HERE AND SHARING YOUR IDEAS WE'RE GONNA PUBLIC COMMENT. I WE GO THROUGH A LITTLE RULE MAKING ON PUBLIC COMMENT FOR THOSE GUYS OBVIOUSLY NO ONE LAUGHED AT MY INITIAL JOKE. SO YOU WERE HERE FOR THE PREVIOUS -- PUBLIC COMMENTS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS A MINUTE EACH. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT BECAUSE WE WANT TO GIVE EVERYBODY THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO TALK AND WE ALSO WANT RESPECT -- THE TIME FOR THAT FOR EVERYBODY THAT'S IN THE ROOM IN THE PANEL MEMBERS. BUT IF SOMEBODY'S ALREADY SAID WHAT YOU SAID COULD YOU PLEASE SAY I ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS -- WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER OR FROM SOME GROUP SO WITH THAT THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. GO AHEAD SIR. I THANK YOU PAUL MASON WITH YA SORRY PALMETTO PACIFIC FOREST IN JUST BECAUSE A GOOD LAUGH DOESN'T MEAN WE WOULDN'T HEAR YOU THE OTHER DAY BUT I JUST BRIEFLY WANT TO HIT -- THREE KEY POINTS HERE WANTED AND WE'RE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RESTORING RESILIENCE THE LANDSCAPE IN A PARTICULAR FOREST CONTEXT WHERE WE WORK -- CERTAINLY REDUCING THE DENSELY WHETHER IT'S THROUGH PRESCRIBED FIRE MECHANICAL THING IS IN THE MEDIA THING WE CAN DO IN THE SHORT TERM. WE ALSO NEED TO GET BACK TO THOSE LONG TERM CONDITIONS WHERE WE HAVE MORE OF THOSE LARGE FIRE RESISTANT TREES ON THE LANDSCAPE SO THERE'D BE THREE LONG TERM THINKING WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. I ROLLED INTO MY SECOND POINT IS THAT ANY. REAL WAY OF ADDRESSING THIS BILL REQUIRE ONGOING STABLE FUNDING SO WE CAN ACTUALLY BUILD PROGRAMS WHERE LANDOWNERS AND BUSINESSES CAN COME TO THE TABLE YOU CAN'T BUILD A WORK FORCE IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT ANY FUNDING TO KEEP DOING THIS WORK IN A COUPLE OF YEARS. SO THAT STABILITY IN FUNDING IS EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT AS THE AMOUNT OF THE FUNDING. AND THE FINAL THOUGHT I WOULD LEAVE YOU WITH THIS THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK ABOUT TARGETS AND YOU KNOW. HALF MILLION ACRE YOUR TARGET THE FOURTH CARBON PLAY IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE TARGETS IT'S ANOTHER TO HAVE SMART TARGETS YOU KNOW. THE TARGET THE FOURTH CARBON PLANS FOR ANY MANAGEMENT BUT THERE'S A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE YOU KNOW THINNING IN GETTING US ON A TRAJECTORY TO A RESILIENT FOR US IN THE FUTURE. FIRST IS A CLEAR CUT THAT'S GONNA PUT US BACK INTO A FIRE PRONE PLANTATION IN TWENTY YEARS AS WE TO DISTINGUISH THOSE AND MAKE SURE WE'RE GOING WHERE WE WANT TO BE DONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT BAKER. JULIA ELEVEN WITH A BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA I'M FORMERLY THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE RESOURCES AGENCY. SENATE JACKSON I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I JUST HAVE TO URGE YOU NOT ONLY TO HAVE MORE WOMEN ON THE PANEL BUT MORE EXPERTS THE SIERRA CLUB IS NOT THE EXPERT. ON EMISSIONS IF YOU TALK TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD OF THE PLASTER COUNTY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT ANY OF THEIR DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE. AGREE THAT. BOB USING FORCE WAYS OR AGRICULTURAL WASTE OR ANY OTHER WOULD WAYS IN A CONTROLLED BIOMASS FACILITIES NINETY EIGHT OR 99% LESS POLLUTING. THAT AN OPEN CONTROLLED BURNS AND EVER TALKING ABOUT FOREST MATERIAL OR SHRUBLAND AROUND YOUR HOME OR A POWER LINE OR COMMUNITY A CONTROLLED BURN IS NOT AN OPTION THE ONLY OPTION. IS MECHANICAL SENDING AND REMOVING OF THAT MATERIAL. AND THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO WITH IT BENEFICIALLY IS THEN CONVERTED TO ENERGY WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY CLEANER. AS THE JONATHAN'S THE SIERRA CLUB SAID HE'S NOT THE EXPERT AND YET HE CITED A STUDY IN A HEALTHY WET FOREST IN SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. WERE WHOLE HEALTHY LOGS WERE THEN SHIPPED TO ENGLAND IN AN OLD COMBUSTION FACILITY THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT THE SITUATION CALIFORNIA AND ITS IS DISINGENUOUS TO USE THOSE SORTS OF NUMBERS ABOUT COMPARING TO COAL AND NATURAL GAS. A STUDY THAT IS UTTERLY IRRELEVANT FOR THE SITUATION HERE. I HAVE MAPS OF THE AIR QUALITY IN CALIFORNIA LAST WEEK IT WAS. AT UNHEALTHY AND HOUSE ARTIST LESER -- LEVELS ALL AROUND THE STATE ESPECIALLY WHERE THE WILDFIRES ARE BURNING WILDFIRE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE AND WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I HAVE A LONG LIST OF SPECIFIC POLICY PROPOSALS ARE GIVEN TO SOME OF YOUR STAFF. I WILL SEND AROUND ALL THE REST YOUR STAFF I'M HAPPY TO LEAVE MAPS FROM THE U. S. A. P. A.. NEXT TIME YOU HAVE A HEARING LIKE THIS PLEASE WORD AND THE U. S. EPA AND THE REAL EXPERTS ON WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR AIR QUALITY IN OUR FORESTS. THANK YOU PLEASE A SUBMIT WRITTEN COMMENTS ARE SPLIT I'D IT AND IF I COULD JUST CORRECT THE RECORD THAT INFORMATION CAME FROM THE P. YOU SEE GENTLEMEN. NOT FROM THE SIERRA CLUB ARE ON THOSE STATISTICS NO IT WAS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT CLUB WHO WAS LIVE AUDIENCE COMPARED TO THAT SELECT. ORGANIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CHRISTY SURE I'M A RETIRED STATE PARK RANGER AS ON THE STATE PARK PRESCRIBED BURN TEAM FOR TEN YEARS AND I WORK AS A WILDLIFE BIOLOGIST IN POST FIRE AREAS. I I THINK WE'RE DEALING WITH A LOT OF GOOD NEWS HERE. IN THAT I THINK THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT MORE AGREEMENT THAN WAS ROTH WAS WAS REFLECTED TODAY IN OUR DISCUSSION -- FOR ONE A WE VISITED EACH OF YOUR OFFICES TODAY AND LEFT A MAP SHOWING THAT MOST OF THE ACRES BURNING IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT ACTUALLY BURNING IN FOREST AT THIS TIME [inaudible] NUMBER. TWO THERE IS A ROBUST AMOUNT OF SCIENCE AND A GREAT AMOUNT OF AGREEMENT THAT SHOWS THAT SNAG FORESTS OR DEAD TREES ACTUALLY BURN. AT LOWER INTENSITY TWO YEARS OUT FROM FROM TREE MORTALITY SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT USING OUR OUR RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA THE DEAD TREES IT'S GOOD NEWS REALLY ARE NOT MUCH OF A FACTOR. IN IN OUR IN OUR QUEST TO TREAT WILDFIRE [inaudible] I'M SO. WE HAVE SOLUTIONS HERE I I'VE HEARD SOLUTIONS WE WE CAN HELP PEOPLE HARDEN THEIR HOMES THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY TAKE BACK YOUR CONSTITUENTS NOW. THERE'S A WHOLE BREADTH OF SCIENCE HEALTHCARE YOU IT'S NOT JUST FOR FIGHTING MY INDEX FINGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMETS. GOOD AFTERNOON STACEY HEAT WITH THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THIRTY FIVE RURAL COUNTIES STATEWIDE IN OUR COUNTIES ARE WHERE MOST OF THE FIRES ARE BURNING RIGHT NOW. AND WE APPRECIATE THIS HEARING TODAY IN THE TOPICS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AYE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES YOU'VE ALL BEEN GIVEN A LETTER AND BEEN SENT A LETTER FROM US THAT HAS MANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS TOPIC. WE WISH THERE WAS ONE MAGIC BULLET THAT WOULD FIX THIS BUT WE KNOW THAT IT TAKES THE WHOLE SUITE OF ACTIVITIES. FROM MECHANICAL THINNING TO PRESCRIBE BURNS TO YES BIOMASS UTILIZATION AND INNOVATIVE WOOD PRODUCTS TO ATTACK THIS THING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME GOOD. UP A GOOD PLAN OF ACTION COME OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU. WELL I'M CHAD HANSEN ON MEDIA FOREST AND FIRE ECOLOGISTS WITH THE JOHN YOUR PROJECT ON I DO RESEARCH ON THESE ISSUES AND A DOZEN KEY IT QUESTIONS WERE BROUGHT UP AND I ENCOURAGE ANYONE COMMITTEE WANTS TO LEARN MORE TO REACH OUT TO ME AND HAVE A CONVERSATION BUT TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OUR FORESTS ARE. ARE UNNATURALLY DANCE -- THAT IS A REALLY SERIOUS MISCONCEPTION. WITH THAT THE SCIENCE TELLS US THAT WE HAVE SLIGHTLY MORE SMALL TREES. OVERALL ON CALIFORNIA SOURCE WE HAVE FEWER MEDIUM TO LARGE TREES OVERALL WE HAVE LESS BIOMASS ARE FORCED NOW THAT WE HAVE HISTORICALLY. AND A LOT OF THAT'S DUE TO DECADES OF LOG. THERE'S A KEY STUDY ON THIS BY BY MCINTYRE ALL TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I'VE DONE RESEARCH ON THIS IS WELL. IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT THE SECOND THING IS THAT -- OVERWHELMINGLY FIREBIRD NOT BY FOREST'S DENSITY OR OVERALL -- THE BIOMASS DENSITY -- OFTENTIMES WHEN FORCE OR LOG THEY TEND TO BURN MORE INTENSELY WE DID THE BIGGEST STUDY EVER DONE ON THAT CROSSING TIGHTLY SEARCHLIGHT STATE THAT'S SIMILAR CAN YOU TELL ME I DIDN'T GET. YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT YES I'M A DOCTOR CHAD HANSEN I'M A FOREST IN FIRE ECOLOGIST WITH THE JOHN IN YOUR PROJECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT BEAKER. GOOD EVENING CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRIS BURNS FROM THE SIERRA BUSINESS COUNCIL AND WE WORKED OUT THIS YEAR NEVADA -- ON THE ON ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ISSUES I'M RUBBING THAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS COMMITTEE ACHIEVES AT LEAST THREE THINGS. ARE THE FIRST THAT IT PROTECTS RURAL RATEPAYERS FROM BOTH FIRE AND INCREASED -- REST ENERGY RATES -- THAT IT THAT THIS COMMITTEE WORKS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE OF FOREST RESTORATION. AND ALSO -- THIRD AYE CAPITALIZES ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS OF FUEL THINNING IN BETTER FORCE MANAGEMENT. HAD THREE THINGS LIKE BIO ENERGY INNOVATIVE -- WOOD PRODUCTS IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PART OF THE REASON WHY MCGUIRE MATERIALS ARE BEING SENT TO BOMB US FACILITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS BECAUSE MANY OF THE RURAL ABOUT MASS FACILITIES HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS AND ARE UNABLE TO TAKE THOSE. MATERIALS SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THOSE BACK UP AND RUNNING THANK YOU THANK YOU. I REBEKAH AUGUST FROM THOSE PARTIES FORCED WATCH -- STUDIES SHOW THAT THE MORE WE DO TO MAKE REMOTE COMMERCIAL PROJECTS. WHICH TAKE THE LEAST FLAMMABLE MATERIALS FROM THE FOREST OR CONVERT NATIVE EDUCATE VEGETATION TOMORROW FILE MATERIALS THE MORE WE TEND TO MAKE FIRES MORE INTENSE OR SPREAD MORE QUICK FARMER QUICKLY. THESE APPROACHES ONLY MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SAFER AND AS SOON AS IT'S CLEAR THAT THE HOMES CONTINUE TO BURN. ON THAT BENEFIT WILL BE GONE. THE FACT IS THAT FIRES HERE LIKE WE'VE ALL SAID AND SORT OF LAYING CONCRETE FROM MEXICO TO OREGON WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO STOP IT. WHAT IS NEEDED IS STRONG SUPPORT OF WHAT'S PROVEN TO PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY LIKE SOME OF WHAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE SET ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MOANS BILL AND OTHERS? PREVENTION SAFETY ADDRESSING EMISSIONS SUPPORTING GRANT PROGRAMS LIKE SENATOR JACKSON'S PAYS CONCEPT ANOTHER INCENTIVES THAT HELP INCENTIVES THAT HELP RESIDENTS MAKE THEIR HOMES FAR SAFE. AND MAINTAIN THAT WAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE MARTINSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION TODAY. THIS REALLY IS OUR PRIORITY IN THIS IN THIS ISSUE SOLUTIONS OFFERED TODAY CAN REALLY GO TO MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES MORE SAFE WE ARE COMMITTED PARTNER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE THE FORCE RESILIENCY GROUP. AND PRESCRIBE VERNE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT BIOMASS THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY NOW TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THANK YOU. PATRICK WELCH FOR THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION ARE WE HAVE LONG SUPPORTED AS WE'VE ARTICULATED THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO THIS AND TO THAT END FOR SUPPORTING A NUMBER OF BILLS INCLUDING SENATOR JACKSON'S BILL ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD SPILL. OUT WHEN IT COMES TO BIOMASS WINTER STAND THAT THAT CAN BE A BENEFICIAL AND USE FOR SOME OF THESE TREES AND VEGETATION THAT'S REMOVED. FROM OUR FORESTS WE HAVE -- OPPOSE PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO CREATE A MANDATE -- THAT GENERALLY INCREASE COSTS ON OUR REPAIRS SO WE ASK THE A COMMITTEE WHEN CONSIDERING THIS ISSUE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. I HEARD MENTIONED AT THE CONCEPT OF A SUBSIDY TO LOWER THE COST AND I THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING CONCEPT TO EXPLORE IF THIS IS. AT THE ROAD THAT THAT COMMITTEE INTENDS -- TO GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JUSTIN AUGUSTINE. I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING IN PARTICIPATING IN FORCE PROJECTS FOR OVER TEN YEARS NOW. AND ISSUE THAT. HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED IN DETAIL HERE. THAT PERMEATES THIS THOSE. WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT FUELS TREATMENTS AND THINNING PROJECTS? MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. WHAT ARE? WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING UNDER THAT TERMINOLOGY? THE TARGETING OF LARGE TREES PROJECTS I PARTICIPATE IN AND AYE BATTLE AGAINST. OUR BECAUSE THEY'RE TARGETING THE LARGER TREES AND THAT'S ACTUALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO MAKING ARE FORCED BY RESILIENT. INSIDE ASK YOU TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE USING THAT TERMINOLOGY TO BE VERY FOCUSED. ON WHAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS OPPOSED TO JUST. THROWING THOSE WORDS AROUND AND END UP CAUSING MORE PROBLEMS THAN YOU ACTUALLY SOLVING THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST KAREN LAYING ON TOP OF THE NEVADA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I WANT TO ECHO AND AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THE RC RC AND SHE SAX HAD. ONE JUST AS UGLY AGAIN CAUGHT THE NEVADA COUNTY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE AS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A COUNTIES COULD BE DOING SHOULD BE DOING TO GET ON TOP OF THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ISSUE. BUT IT REQUIRES RESOURCES AND THEN THOSE NEED TO BE ONGOING RESOURCES I THINK MISTER KORDA COULD SPEAK TO THE AGGRESSIVE NATURE OF HE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD EVENING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOWING HE TO COME BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL CALIFORNIA COTTON GIN NURSING GROWERS ASSOCIATION. AMERICAN PISTACHIO GROWERS IN WESTERN ON PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY I THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PACKAGE IF ANYTHING COMES OUT OF THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IT NEEDS TO BE HOW WE PREVENT THESE HUGE FOREST FIRES. A LOT OF THIS DISCUSSION HAS BEEN ON COSTS AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING. BIGGER FIRES BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT TAKING CARE OF OUR FORESTS -- WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BIOMASS FOR AGAN FOREST RIGHT WASTE WE AGREE THAT THIS SHOULDN'T BE A MANDATE THOUGH BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST FURTHER INCREASE COSTS SO LOOKING AT SOME OTHER OPTIONS. ALSO IF -- DAY COMMITTEE MEMBERS OR ANY OF THE STAFF ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING SOME OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY COMING OUT OF BIOMASS RIGHT HERE IN WOODLAND WE HAVE WEST BIOFUELS -- THAT WESTERN ART PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION AND UC DAVIS WORKS WITH AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SET UP A TOUR FOR YOU SO. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED PLEASE LET US KNOW IT'S JUST A QUICK TRIP FROM THE CAPITOL THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LIZ FORCED BURKE I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. CALIFORNIA MUST BE PREPARED TO FACE THE NEW NORMAL OF YOUR AROUND WILDFIRES SCIENCE SHOWS THAT ECOLOGICAL THINNING AND PRESCRIBED BURNING TOGETHER CAN EFFECTIVELY CHANGE BONFIRE BEHAVIOR. THEY TO CONSERVANCY SUPPORTS POLICIES AND FUNDING THAT INCREASES THE PAY SCALE FOR THESE ACTIVITIES TO REDUCE WILDFIRE THREAT. THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS -- SO MY NAME IS WILL ABRAMS I'M HERE REPRESENTING MY FAMILY MY COMMUNITY I'M FROM SANTA ROSA -- WE ARE GOT ALERTED TO THE FIRES IN THAT AREA ON OCTOBER EIGHTH -- AS OUR HOME WAS BURNING AND URGES BURNING IN MY KIDS WERE SCREAMING THEY WERE GONNA DIE SO THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE THAT I'M COMING FROM -- AND USUALLY AFTER SORT OF THE INITIAL SHOCK OF THAT -- MADE -- BECAUSE OF MY BACKGROUND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS AN EARLY ALERT SYSTEM I CALLED PGM NEED TO GET SOME BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD BE PUT ON POLLS FOR THAT -- I GOT ZERO ANSWERS ON THAT SUBJECT LATER ON WHEN THE REPORTS CAME OUT THAT SIXTEEN OF THE FIRES WERE DEFINITELY CAUSED BY PEACHY NEED EQUIPMENT AGAIN CALLED PJ NEED TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO UNDERGROUND UTILITIES IN MY? COMMUNITY AGAIN I GOT ZERO INFORMATION FROM THEM IN TERMS OF INFORMATION THAT I COULD USE A PROCESS THAT. THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIVE -- IN THAT REGARD IN THE ONLY THING THAT WILL MAKE THEM RESPONSIVE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO MAKE SURE THAT OCCURS. THANK THANK YOU SIR. CATHERINE PART OF AN AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION I JUST WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH MYSELF WITH ALL THE COMMENTS THAT YOU. HAVE MENTIONED TODAY I THINK THIS IS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PANEL DISCUSSION AND ALL THE DIFFERENT PANELS AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO ADDRESSING THIS. FIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN WHITE HERE WE HAVE THE TELEPHONE LICENSE FORCES SOCIALIZATION AND THE FORCE ANNALS OF CALIFORNIA OF THE LICENSE FORCES SOCIALIZATION ARE THE STATE'S REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS. SO THEY REALLY ARE THE EXPERTS ON IMPROVING ON THE FORCE MANAGEMENT THEY PROVE ALL THE TO HARVEST PLANS AND THEY ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE WHAT'S ACTION MANAGE. WOULD ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH A GORDON AND HIS COMMENTS A LOT OF THINGS THAT HE WAS TALK ABOUT WE WE WOULD AGREE WITH. OF THE FOR SALE OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE DIFFERENT THEIR SMALL MOM AND POP. THE LANDOWNERS THERE WHAT WILL BE CONSIDER WE DON'T HAVE A RESOURCE TO GO OUT AND DO A LOT OF THE THE CLEARING THE BRUSH MANAGEMENT SO WE REALLY HAVE AN ECONOMIC ISSUE HERE. BEST ESTIMATES OF ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES OF OF MAN'S LAND OUT THERE BUT ONLY. ABOUT TEN THOUSAND ACRES AT TO BE MANAGED FOR A LOT OF REASONS WE HAVE ABSENTEE LANDOWNERS WE HAVE PEOPLE JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCE TO GET IT DONE. WE DO THINK THAT OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS BIOMASS WHICH COULD BE PARTNER SOLUTION. MAYBE MAYBE PART OF THAT BUT IT REALLY IS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE I MEAN WE HAVE TO GET. FINALLY TO GET THE RESOURCES SUBSIDY ISSUE I THINK WAS MENTIONED MAY WE USED CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS TO SUPPLY SOME THE COST OF THE TRANSPORTATION THAT MIGHT BE ONE AVENUE. PRESCRIBED BURNING ALSO IS A IS A POTENTIAL ISSUE BUT THERE'S A LIABILITY ISSUE WE LIKE TO HAVE THAT ADDRESSES WILL [inaudible] YOUR COMMENTS. HELLO AMERICORPS OLSON A REPRESENT -- LICENSE TIMBER OPERATORS AND TRUCK DRIVERS AND OTHERS TO BASICALLY DO THE WORK AND BASICALLY TREES DON'T THAN THEMSELVES MATERIAL DOESN'T COME OF THE FORCE FLOOR. AND DRIVE ITSELF THE BIOMASS FACILITIES IN THEIR CONSERVATIVE FEW OF OUR PEOPLE IN THIS INDUSTRY THAN THERE USED TO BE. I MIGHT ADD MOST OF THEM ARE IN THE AGE PRACTICE THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES SO WE NEED TO REPLENISH THIS WITH THE YOUNGER GENERATION HOW USED TO BE DONE. IS A SMALL BUSINESS FAMILY OWNED COMPANIES GRANDPARENTS AND PASS IT ON TO THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF PASS IT ON TO THE GRAND DAUGHTERS GRANDSONS BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY SO INTERESTED IN IF THEY CAN EARN A LIVING AT IT. GET MARRIED RAISE A FAMILY AND HAVE A LONG TERM SENSIBILITY ABOUT. SO DON'T FORGET US NOW WE'VE SENATE ANY -- AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT POLICIES WE SUPPORT WE'RE CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OR SEEKING A THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES RIGHT NOW IN ALL SEGMENTS OF THE NORTHERN PART OF CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK PEOPLE SOMETIMES ASSUME THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS WORK ASSEMBLY THERE. AND ACTUALLY DWINDLING THEIR AGING AND WE SHOULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS DISCUSSION AND WE ARE PART OF THE FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE AND I AM OF BILLS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR.
