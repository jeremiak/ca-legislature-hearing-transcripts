DEVELOPED. IN IN ALL CANDOR I'M

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:50.949
SKEPTICAL OF THE NEW TESTS I'M

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:51.750
SKEPTICAL FOR A COUPLE OF

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:55.587
REASONS- I'M SKEPTICAL BECAUSE

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:56.121

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:02.561
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.430
DOLLARS. ON A NEW TEST TO FIND

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:05.331
OUT WHERE IN THE EXACT SAME

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:06.965
SITUATION WE WERE WITH THE SAT

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:10.703

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:16.909
HEADS OF ADMISSIONS INCLUDING-

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:18.944

00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:52.731
ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS IS UC

WE DID SPEAK ABOUT THAT AND

00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:20.826
MILLS COLLEGE IS- SOMETHING

00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:24.563
THAT WE ARE LOOKING INTO TO OUR-

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:27.232
THERE'S NOT. THERE IT IS AND-

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.967
HAS SOME DEEP FINANCIAL ISSUES

00:24:29.034 --> 00:24:30.235
AND THERE MIGHT BE AN

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:31.403
INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY COMING

00:24:31.469 --> 00:24:33.972
FORTH. FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF

CONVERSATIONS ARE ONGOING I

00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:47.385
THINK- LOOK WE ALL WANT TO

00:24:47.452 --> 00:24:50.121
EDUCATE THE- THE MAXIMUM NUMBER

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:51.723

CALIFORNIANS- AND GROWTH IS

00:24:55.293 --> 00:24:56.328
GOING TO BE ONE OF OUR BIGGEST

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:58.063
ISSUES. I THINK WHAT THE

00:24:58.129 --> 00:25:00.732
BALANCING ACT IS HOW DO YOU

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:03.802

00:25:07.205 --> 00:25:09.407
IMPORTANT TO US WE WANT TO SEE

AND SO GROWTH IS IMPORTANT BUT

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:19.484
THE MAINTAINING MAINTAINING

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:21.219
EXCELLENCE IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT

00:25:21.286 --> 00:25:22.053
AND I THINK THAT'S THE

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.455
BALANCING ACT THAT WE'RE GOING

00:25:23.521 --> 00:25:25.624

CLERICAL ERROR SIGN CHECK STUBS

01:36:11.232 --> 01:36:13.134
