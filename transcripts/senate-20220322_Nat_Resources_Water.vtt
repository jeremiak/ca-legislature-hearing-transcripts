CONSERVANCY WHICH IS. I THINK

TODAY- THAT EXPANDS THE

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.742
BOUNDARIES OF CONSERVANCIES AND

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:28.314
LAST YEAR SENATOR DOLLY. R. AS

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:34.220

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:49.335
PARTICULARLY WITH THE SMALLER

00:12:49.401 --> 00:12:51.604

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.771
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN A

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:55.040

00:12:57.476 --> 00:13:00.079
IMPORTANT TO EXPAND IT AND DO

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:03.749

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.583
POSSIBLE AND THAT WILD PLACES

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.684
ARE POSSIBLE AND THAT SOMEHOW

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.953
THAT OUGHT TO BE ONLY RELEGATED

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.021
TO SAY THE SANTA MONICA

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:30.522
MOUNTAINS OR THE SANTA SUSANNA

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:33.125

GOING TO ENTAIL- HAS BEEN OPEN

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.799
SPACE. AND WE SORT OF DENIED IT

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:43.302
IT'S NATURAL USE- BY PAVING OVER

A LOT OF THIS WATER SHOULD WE

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:45.904
THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:47.673
SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.342

THE KIND OF HOUSING WE NEED BUT

00:16:52.911 --> 00:16:53.712
A RIGHT TO NATURE FOR THESE

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:56.148
COMMUNITIES TO SO THAT WHEN YOU

00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:57.716

00:44:16.353 --> 00:44:17.554
SIMILAR TO THIS ONE- WHICH

00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:18.122

SEEM TO- THE GOAL. IS TO

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.895
ESTABLISH A SEA LEVEL RISE

00:44:24.962 --> 00:44:27.031
REVOLVING LOAN FUND TO PROVIDE

00:44:27.097 --> 00:44:28.532
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH AN

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:29.566

00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:33.404
LEVEL RISE WHILE PROTECTING BOTH

PROPERTY OWNERS AND TAXPAYERS-

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.174
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:38.642
BECOME A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR A LOT

00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:39.810
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE L.

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:41.712
A. TIMES THAT A FASCINATING

00:44:41.779 --> 00:44:44.081
PIECE ON THIS. I THAT I COMMEND

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:45.416
EVERYONE IT'S BEEN A REALLY

00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:46.450
HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE UNIQUE

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.385
CHALLENGES AND AN EXCRUCIATING

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:49.987
CHALLENGES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:51.555
ARE FACING THE HAVE A GROUP OF.

00:44:51.622 --> 00:44:52.856
HOMEOWNERS WHO LIVE RIGHT ON THE

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:54.725
COAST WHO ARE COMING IN ASKING

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:55.759
THEM TO SPEND MORE AND MORE OF

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:57.628
THEIR MEAGER CITY BUDGETS ON.

00:44:57.694 --> 00:44:59.363
FIGHTING BACK AGAINST SEA LEVEL

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:00.431
RISE WHILE THERE YOU KNOW

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:01.932
WHETHER THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO FIND

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:04.568
OTHER. NEEDS FROM YOU KNOW PARKS

00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:06.236
AND SENIOR PROGRAMS-

00:45:06.303 --> 00:45:09.306
TRANSPORTATION LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:10.808
WHATEVER ELSE. SO THE IDEA HERE

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:12.943
IS THAT WE WOULD CREATE A OF AN

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.978
ABSOLUTE VOLUNTARY. LOAN FUND

00:45:15.045 --> 00:45:17.181
THAT WOULD CANCEL OUT IT WOULD

00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:19.483
BREAK EVEN- YOU WOULD PROVIDE

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:20.284
THIS FINANCING TOOL OVER THE

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.152
WOULD LOAN MONEY TO LOCAL

00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:23.420
GOVERNMENTS THAT COULD THEN BUY

00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:24.188
PROPERTIES THAT WILL BE

00:45:24.254 --> 00:45:26.590
THREATENED BY SEA LEVEL RISE. IN

00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:28.092
A DECADE OR TWO ENABLING THE

00:45:28.158 --> 00:45:29.793
OWNERS TO SELL WHILE THE

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:30.828
PROPERTY STILL HAVE VALUE AND

00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:31.862
THEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD

00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:32.863
AND RAN OUT THE PROPERTY.

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:35.332
REPAYING THE LOAN A POTENTIALLY

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:36.667
EVEN EARNING REVENUE. I WHEN THE

00:45:36.733 --> 00:45:37.801
PROPERTY IS NO LONGER

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:39.570
INHABITABLE DUE TO THE RISK OF

00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:40.838
FLOODING FROM RISING SEA LEVELS

00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:43.173
THE HOUSE COULD BE DEMOLISHED OR

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:43.774
RELOCATED WITHOUT. THE LOCAL

00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:46.009
RESIDENTS OR TAXPAYERS BEARING

00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:50.848
THE COST. SO ON THE GOVERNOR

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:53.383
VETOED THE BILL LAST YEAR WE

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:54.885
READ HIS VETO STATEMENT TALK TO

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:56.420
POKE THE MINISTRATION VERY

00:45:56.487 --> 00:45:58.388
CAREFULLY AND WE'VE ADJUSTED OUR

00:45:58.455 --> 00:45:59.523
PROPOSAL. IN CLOSE COOPERATION

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.158
WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER WHO

WILL BE TESTIFYING SHORTLY AND

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:03.927
WE WOULD JUST OF THE PROPOSED IN

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:05.696
TWO KEY WAYS THAT WE THINK WILL

00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:07.431
ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR'S CONCERNS

00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:08.699
FIRST OF ALL THE BILL

00:46:08.765 --> 00:46:09.733
PRIORITIZES. FUNDING FIRST A LOW

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.868
INCOME COMMUNITIES IN THOSE

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:12.269
HARDEST HIT BY CLIMATE CHANGE

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:14.071
THE BILL ALSO CALLS FOR

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:15.005
PARTICIPATING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:46:15.072 --> 00:46:16.373
TO CRAFT. PROJECT- THE PROPERTY

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.276
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS. AND

INTO THEIR CURRENT. LOCAL

00:46:22.312 --> 00:46:25.916
COASTAL PLAN. HI THIS WILL BE

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:27.217
ENSURE THAT THE NEW PROGRAM IS

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:28.051

COURTNEY WITH THE PRO TIMES SB

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:33.790
ONE THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR. I

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:35.659
SAW IT AS A MENTION LOCAL

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:37.261
GOVERNMENTS ARE ARE THEIR

00:46:37.327 --> 00:46:38.061
THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO FIND

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:38.896
CREATIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS THE

00:46:38.962 --> 00:46:41.131
CLIMATE CRISIS WHILE BALANCING.

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:42.900
VERY LIMITED BUDGETS. THEY'RE

00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:43.767
NOT MANY OPTIONS AND ALSO

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:44.902
ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF LOCAL

00:46:44.968 --> 00:46:47.337
RESIDENTS PROPERTY OWNERS- YEAH

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:49.773
THIS IS BEEN A REAL ISSUE OF

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.208
CONTROVERSY A LOT OF COMMUNITIES

00:46:51.275 --> 00:46:53.010
IN THE COURSE BUILDING SEA WALLS

00:46:53.076 --> 00:46:54.611
WHICH OF COURSE IS THE- THE

00:46:54.678 --> 00:46:56.547
PREFERRED- MITIGATION IS THIS

00:46:56.613 --> 00:46:58.448
NOT JUST EXPENSIVE BUT- AS YOUR

00:46:58.515 --> 00:47:00.350
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT IT

00:47:00.417 --> 00:47:01.251

OF ALL. YOU CAN NEVER WIN

00:47:03.787 --> 00:47:05.622
AGAINST THE C. IN THE LONG RUN

00:47:05.689 --> 00:47:07.457
BUT IT ALSO IMPACTS. THE FLOW OF

00:47:07.524 --> 00:47:09.526

OTHER COASTAL COMMUNITIES UP AND

00:47:14.698 --> 00:47:17.000
DOWN THE COAST. I BECAUSE IT

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.202
KIND OF PUSHES OFF THE PROBLEM

THEY'LL GET A WHOLE LOT HARDER

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.241
WHEN INSURANCE COMPANIES REFUSE

AND PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE GOING

00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:13.743
