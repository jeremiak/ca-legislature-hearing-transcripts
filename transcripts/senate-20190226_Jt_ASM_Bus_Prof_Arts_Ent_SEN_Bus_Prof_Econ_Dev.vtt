BIGGER PROBLEMS AFFECT IN EQUITY

OKAY.

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:48.472
TV BLOCKS ARE SET UP FOR THREE

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:50.240
MINUTE ROUNDS SO WHEN --

OF TIME.

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:58.916
QUE TWO MINUTE ROUNDS DOESN'T

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:00.784
FUNCTION QUAD AS WELL AND AND

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:04.254
AND FOR A LONG TIME WE FALL TWO

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.789
MINUTES AND WE STILL.

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:07.658
WOMEN ARE TOO MANY MEN THREE MEN

00:47:07.724 --> 00:47:09.526
IT CHAMPIONSHIP FOR WOMEN OR

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:13.463
STAND AROUND CHAMPIONSHIP FOR

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:14.765
MANNER TWELVE ROUNDS.

00:47:14.831 --> 00:47:15.399
MIXED MARTIAL ARTS IS NOT THAT

00:47:15.465 --> 00:47:17.501
WAY.

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:19.369
WE MADE THE DECISION BACK IN

00:47:19.436 --> 00:47:21.738
ABOUT TWO OUT BELIEVES TWO

00:47:21.805 --> 00:47:22.306
THOUSAND EIGHT THE COMMITTEE

00:47:22.372 --> 00:47:24.608
RECOMMENDED THAT THE THAT WOMEN

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:26.543
FOUGHT THE SAME AS ME IN. FIVE

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.179
IN FIVE FIVE MINUTE ROUNDS.

00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:30.714
RONDA ROUSEY'S ONE OF THE MOST

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:32.583
FAMOUS SPOTTERS THAT THAT THAT

00:47:32.649 --> 00:47:33.784
THAT HAS BEEN.

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:35.752
GâY WE HAVE A LOT OF FEMALES

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:37.721
THAT ARE UP IN COMMON IN THE

00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:40.991
RANKS AND I BELIEVE.

00:47:41.058 --> 00:47:42.492
I WANT TO SEE MORE DATA TO LOOK

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:45.195
AT IT BUT I CAN'T SEE A GOOD

00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:47.664
RATIONAL REASON.

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:48.031
NOW.

00:47:48.098 --> 00:47:52.603
AND I WASN'T THIS.

00:47:52.669 --> 00:47:53.604
THOUSAND EIGHT BUT I CAN'T TELL

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:54.538
YOU SITTING HERE TODAY THAT I

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:56.673
SEE A GOOD REASON WHY WOMEN

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.408
CAN'T FOUGHT THREE MINUTE ROUNDS

00:47:58.475 --> 00:47:59.910
AND IF THEY FALL THREE MINUTE

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:00.410
ROUNDS.

00:48:00.477 --> 00:48:02.579
I THINK AT THAT POINT YOU SEE AN

00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:04.348
EQUITY INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE

00:48:04.414 --> 00:48:06.750
STUDY THAT WE DID THE TEN ROUND

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:08.819
FEMALE FIGHTERS MADE MORE THAN

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:10.287
THE TEN AROUND MALE FIGHTERS

00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:11.288
OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEIR

00:48:11.355 --> 00:48:12.756
CHAMPIONSHIP LEVEL.

00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:15.959
I THINK THAT LEVELS THE PLAYING

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:18.262
FIELD IN SOME RESPECTS.

00:48:18.328 --> 00:48:19.196
THAT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU KNOW

00:48:19.263 --> 00:48:20.030

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:22.099

THE WORST EXCUSES FOR ANYTHING --

00:48:30.807 --> 00:48:32.376
I THINK IN REGARD TO MAKING SURE

00:56:32.922 --> 00:56:34.624
THEY'LL STAY AS HEALTHY AS

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:37.127
POSSIBLE THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREER

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:39.095
AND THEN HAVE A FUTURE.

00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:41.331
SO THAT IT DOES THAT WOULD

00:56:41.397 --> 00:56:42.866
REJECT HAS SOMETHING TO THAT

00:56:42.932 --> 00:56:43.166
[inaudible]

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:45.902
THE I MEAN.

00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:46.770
NO I THINK THAT MEAN THAT SUMS

00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:47.904
UP WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:49.372
WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:52.142
AND AND FOLLOWING UP WITH THE

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:53.376
FATHERS THAT HAVE?

00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:57.914
LONG SINCE SINCE RETIRED --

00:56:57.981 --> 00:56:59.282
I THINK DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:01.584
NOW IN CONTINUING TO TRY TO

00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:04.654
IMPROVE AND AND AND INTO DO

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:06.356
BETTER -- IS

00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:08.024
HELP ON ONE THING THAT WE DO AND

00:57:08.091 --> 00:57:09.726
I'M SURE THAT YOU GOT A YOU KNOW

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:11.661
BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE WROTE

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:13.129
THE LAW --

00:57:13.196 --> 00:57:14.531
WE HAVE BEEN MORE HOURS ON ALL

00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:15.832
THE FATHERS AND WE HAVE THAT

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:17.267
PERIODICALLY AND WE'RE JUST PASS

00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:19.235
AND REGULATIONS TO INCREASE THE

00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:20.303
NUMBER THAT WE GET ON THAT THE

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.838
PERIOD THE PERIODIC INSTEAD OF

00:57:21.905 --> 00:57:24.507
EVERY FIVE YEARS WILL BE DOING

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:26.209
IT EVERY THREE YEARS --

00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:27.443
THE ONE THING THAT SEE THREE

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:30.146
DOES SIR AND AND I DIDN'T GET

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:32.282
THE S. UNTIL I WE STARTED THIS

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:33.216
PROGRAM.

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:36.820
IS THE BRAIN CAN LOOK THE SAME --

00:57:36.886 --> 00:57:38.421
WITH VERY MUCH VERY SIMILAR IN A

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:40.290
PICTURE AND THAT THERE'S NOT

00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:41.724
PHYSICAL CHANGES BUT SEE THREE

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:44.093
WILL TRACK THE NEUROLOGICAL

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.829
FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN.

00:57:45.895 --> 00:57:47.897
VERSES THE PHYSICAL --

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:50.133
FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN AND

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:50.700
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:57:50.767 --> 00:57:51.100
THOSE [inaudible]

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:53.736
TWO IN.

00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:54.737
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT

00:57:54.804 --> 00:57:55.839
SIR AND I DON'T WANT THE WORD

00:57:55.905 --> 00:57:57.140
YOU'RE MOUTH BUT WE WANT TO MAKE

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:58.741
SURE THAT THESE VOTERS HAVE GOOD

00:57:58.808 --> 00:58:00.276
QUALITY OF LIFE LATER.

00:58:00.343 --> 00:58:01.477
WE DON'T WANT THE NEUROLOGICAL

00:58:01.544 --> 00:58:03.313
DECLINED TO AFFECT THEIR QUALITY

00:58:03.379 --> 00:58:05.081
OF LIFE LATER.

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:06.115
SOMETHING ENOUGH I KNOW I KNOW

00:58:06.182 --> 00:58:08.184
WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:09.719
SOMETHING WE WANT AS WELL.

00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:11.221
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STARTING

00:58:11.287 --> 00:58:12.922
THIS NEUROLOGICAL FUNCTION --

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.891
PROTOCOLS AND HOPEFULLY THIS

00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:17.126
WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON

00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:18.895
THE CALIFORNIA'S LICENSEES YET

00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:20.463
SO I I APPRECIATE THAT I

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:21.464
APPRECIATE THE WITH WITH THE

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:24.067
WORK IN THE FOCUS ON HYDRATION

00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:26.336
AND AND WAIT --

00:58:26.402 --> 00:58:27.737
I JUST WONDER IF WE'RE JUST

00:58:27.804 --> 00:58:29.706
RUNNING AWAY FROM A FAX THAT'S

00:58:29.772 --> 00:58:31.207
OUT THERE AND THAT WE JUST DON'T

00:58:31.274 --> 00:58:32.342
WANT TO CONFRONT.

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:34.210
WHICH IS HOW HAVE THESE FIGHTERS

00:58:34.277 --> 00:58:35.411
THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE SPORT

00:58:35.478 --> 00:58:37.480
GOING BACK TEN YEARS TWENTY

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:38.781
YEARS WHICH MEANS THERE THIRTY

00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:40.283
AND FORTY YEARS OLD.

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:42.418
OR THOSE THAT ARE --

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:45.788
FOR YOUR FIFTH EFFECT OF THIS --

00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:48.458
COMBAT SPORT ON THEIR LIVES --

00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:49.492
AND THAT I GUESS I'M HEARING

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:51.060
FROM YOU THAT YOU'RE LOOKING

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:52.195
FORWARD AND YOU HAVE SOME

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:54.197
ACTIVITIES THAT YOU THINK WILL

00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:55.798
HELP MAKE THE SPORT SAFER.

00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:57.300
BUT IS THERE NO --

00:58:57.367 --> 00:59:00.904
WORK TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS.

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:07.010
ON THOSE WHO'VE COME BEFORE. ONE

00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:08.645
THING I COULD ADD.

00:59:08.711 --> 00:59:11.180
SENATOR THAT --

00:59:11.247 --> 00:59:12.582
FOR FOR ME TO IS THAT A LOT OF

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:14.250
THE FIGHTERS TO COME TO THE

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:15.351
EVENTS.

00:59:15.418 --> 00:59:17.487
AROUND THE ACTIVITIES BEFORE THE

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:18.788
EVENTS AND ENTER THE VENTS AND

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:20.390
YOU GET TO MEET THEM THE FAMOUS

00:59:20.456 --> 00:59:21.391
ONES THAT WE'VE PROBABLY ALL

00:59:21.457 --> 00:59:22.959
HEARD OF AND BY THEIR VERY

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:25.495
PRESENCE YOU CAN SEE THE EFFECT

00:59:25.561 --> 00:59:28.031
OF THE LONG CAREER.

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:28.398
PARTICULARLY --

00:59:28.464 --> 00:59:30.233
CAREER --

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.467
THAT MAYBE I WENT BACK TO THE

00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:32.435
DAYS OF MUHAMMAD ALI WHEN THEY

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:34.737
FOUGHT EVERY MONTH.

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:35.805
AND THEY FOUGHT YOU KNOW.

00:59:35.872 --> 00:59:38.007
NUMEROUS ROUNDS AND I HAD ALL

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:39.075
THESE FIGHTS WORK TODAY.

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:40.443
THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN ANY

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.477
LONGER SO.

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:42.779
MAYBE BY THEIR PRESENCE THERE IS

00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:45.181
SOME EXAMPLE BUT THERE IS NO

00:59:45.248 --> 00:59:46.849
REAL.

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:48.551
KIND OF STUDY OR OR DISCUSSION

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:49.986
ABOUT THAT BUT IT'S AN EXCELLENT

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:51.321
IDEA AND I'M SURE THAT SOME OF

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:53.556
THEM WOULD BE WILLING. TO TO

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:54.991
MENTOR AND I THINK DOING MENTOR

00:59:55.058 --> 00:59:56.492
YOUNG FIGHTERS ON THE CLEVELAND

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:58.227
CLINIC LATER ONE CLINIC IS DOING

00:59:58.294 --> 01:00:00.263
A STUDY ON THAT WELL I I I

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:00.863
APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:05.768
AND UNSETTLED.

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:07.403
YET -- THE

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:08.504
THERE'S LOTS OF IT YOU KNOW

01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:10.640
RATIONALIZATIONS FOR FOR HOW WE

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:11.307
DO THINGS.

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:13.042
AND I I IT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:14.978
FROM THE ENERGY THAT YOU'RE

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:16.612
PUTTING INTO HOW WE CAN DO IT

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:17.680
BETTER.

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:18.881
BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE TO OWN UP

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:20.350
TO THE PAST.

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:23.119
AND AND IT MAY BE UNCOMFORTABLE

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:25.054
AND MAYBE STARK BUT I DON'T

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:25.755
THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO BE

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:27.156
IGNORED AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:28.624
OPPORTUNITY.

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:29.993
TO RAISE THESE QUESTIONS.

01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:33.796
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FINAL

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:36.099
QUESTION FROM SOMEONE WITHOUT.

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:38.735
THE RESEARCHER AND SO JUST.

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:39.335
TO SO I HAVE A SON WHO JUST

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:40.570
PLACED FIFTH IN THE STATE IN

01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:42.338
WRESTLING OF LAST WEEKEND AND SO

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:43.973
HE'S BEEN HE WAS TO TWENTY WHEN

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.475
HE CAME IN FOR FOOTBALL AND HE

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:48.611
CAN'T WAIT --

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:49.612
TO ONE NINETY FIVE SO HYDRATION

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:51.314
IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT IS

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.415
VERY CRITICAL --

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.217
TO FIGHTER OR WRESTLER ANYBODY

01:00:54.283 --> 01:00:55.985
COMPETITIVE SPORTS BUT IN THIS

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:57.120
INDUSTRY.

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:58.321
WEIGHT HAS TO DO WITH WHERE

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.556
YOU'RE BRACKETED AND WORRY AND

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.959
SO WHAT HAPPENS TO THE THAT WELL

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:05.628
I KNOW THE CIF AND AND THE HIGH

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:07.497
SCHOOL SPORTS HAVE A REALLY.

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:09.298
DETAILED HYDRATION PLAN YOU HAVE

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:10.066
YOU HAVE TO YOU CAN ONLY CUT

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:11.501
WEIGHT SO FAST.

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:12.769
WHAT WHAT ABOUT THAT IN TERM

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:14.871
PERIOD BETWEEN WHERE THEY GO PRO

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.205
OR THEY THERE AND THERE'S

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:17.573
THERE'S REALLY NO RATE THERE IF

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.508
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:20.243
SPOT FROM?

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:21.811
HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE MAYBES

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:24.680
ACTIVITIES. TO THE PRO RAIKES

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:25.948
WHO'S MONITORING THAT ARIAN

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.650
THERE BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY A

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:29.218
WHOLE BUNCH OF THIS DATA IN

01:01:29.285 --> 01:01:30.686
THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REALLY.

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:32.989
IN A REGULATED ENVIRONMENT

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:33.523
THEY'RE DOING IT IS JAMMED

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:35.892
SOMEWHERE --

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:39.562
TRYING TO GET TO THE TO THE RANK.

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.998
SIR A FOR FOR AMATEUR MMA

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:44.400
PROGRAM. FOR LET'S BE CLEAR

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:45.902
WHITE CUTTINGS A BIG PROBLEM IN

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:47.637
BOTH THE SPORTS BUT IT'S BIGGER

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:49.238
PROBLEM MIXED MARTIAL ARTS

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:50.139
BECAUSE OF THE WRESTLING

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:51.741
BACKGROUND THAT YOU JUST.

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:53.709
DID YOU JUST LAID OUT --

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:55.978
BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DELEGATES

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:58.448
TO ARAM AT YOUR ORGANIZATION

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:00.283
CALLED CAMO AND THEY THEY

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:02.051
PROVIDE.

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:03.820
ME ALL THE DATA.

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.354
OWN THE FONTS ROM THE AMATEUR

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:07.824
RANKS SO I'M ABLE TO VIEW IT.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:10.259
OKAY SO YOUR POINT IF I SEE A

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:12.862
MIDDLE WAY TO ANIMATE ONE EIGHTY

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:14.063
FIVE READ BALK ONE EIGHTY FIVE

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.298
THE ENTIRE TIME.

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:19.602
A LOT OF TIMES THEN GOSPEL FLINK.

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:21.671
I WOULD BE BETTER IF.

01:02:21.737 --> 01:02:22.271
FIFTY FIVE AND THEY'LL TRY TO

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:23.773
CUT THAT.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.942
YEAH OUT I'VE GOT WE GOT A NEW

01:02:26.008 --> 01:02:28.911
SYSTEM IN PLACE AND PART OF IT --

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.513
PART OF ITS LICENSE IN MY WEIGHT

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.215
CLASS IMAGINE THAT CONCEPT THAT

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:35.218
I WOULDN'T DONE THREE YEARS AGO.

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:36.552
AND NOW WE'RE LICENSE IN THE

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:37.587
WEIGHT CLASS HAVE THE DOCTOR

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:39.956
CERTIFY THIS IS APPROPRIATE

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:41.390
WEIGHT CLASS FOR YOU --

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:43.359
SO THAT THEY'RE NOT.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.393
THEY'RE STILL CUT IN A LOT OF

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.895
WEIGHT LET'S BE CLEAR BUT

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:46.863
THEY'RE NOT.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.564
WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE NUMBER

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:51.400
START TO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT.

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.369
AND I THINK PART OF IT IS IF YOU

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.904
GET THESE REAL DRASTIC WHITE

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:56.038
CUTTERS --

WHERE ADDRESS IN IT WE'RE DOING

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:29.999
ALL WE CAN OUR OB THIS IS ONE OF

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.000
THE ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:32.935
FOCUSED ON BECAUSE I THINK THIS

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:33.769
IS?

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:36.339
THIS IS THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE LOOK

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:38.274
DRUG TESTING IS HARD I HAVE TO

01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:40.443
USE A SCIENTIST UCLA IT TELL ME

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:42.245
THIS ISN'T I CAN USE THIS WITH

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:45.781
THE SCALE I CAN LOOK AT MY EYES

01:04:45.848 --> 01:04:47.416
EASILY THEM WHY IAN'S UNLIKE.

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:48.784
YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE BILLION BUT

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:50.186
YOUR SON WRESTLES HE MIGHT HAVE

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:51.554
YOU SEEN WATER LOAD YOU SEEN

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:53.522
THAT PRACTICE BEFORE WHERE THEY

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:55.524
TAKE AWAY THE GALLONS OF WATER

01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:56.592
AND DRINK YOU.

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:58.294
IN THE NEXT DAY THEY DRINK A

01:04:58.361 --> 01:04:59.362
LITTLE LESS THAN THAT ACTUALLY

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:01.130
SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER THIS FORCES

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:06.636
THE KIDNEYS JUST BOW OUT WATER

01:05:06.702 --> 01:05:07.870
YOU CAN JUST CUT ALL CONNELL.

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:09.305
THAT'S NOT HEALTH.

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:10.940
HE ONLY KNEW THAT SO MANY TIMES

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:12.541
THAT SOME BAD THINGS HAPPEN.

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:13.576
IN EASILY THAT WAY WE'RE TRYING

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:14.944
TO GET RID OF THAT STUFF FOR

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.178
TRYING TO HAVE PEOPLE.

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:17.213

SO WE DO.

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:26.055
SO WHAT BEING PART OF THIS SPORT.

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:27.323
FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS I'VE BEEN

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:28.591
IN A GYM EVERYDAY WATCHING MY

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:29.792
SON RUSSELL.

01:05:29.859 --> 01:05:31.160
AND HE'S SO LIKE I SAID HE WAS A

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:32.061
TWO TWENTY FOOTBALL PLAYER AND

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:34.196
HE'S A ONE NINETY FIVE TO ONE

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:34.830
NINETY SEVEN WRESTLER BUT HE'S

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:36.732
AT THE WEIGHT WHERE HE'S NOT

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.834
HAPPENED IT WERE ANY STRONG

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:39.035
THERE.

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:39.468
YEAH.

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:40.569
THAT'S LETTING UNLESS THE OTHER

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:41.837
THING IS YOU WATCH HIM CUT AND

01:05:41.904 --> 01:05:46.442
THEIR WEEK THEY CAN'T FIGHT IN

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:47.076
WHERE THEY CAN'T THEIR STREET IS

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:48.311
NOT THERE.

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:49.712
BUT MY WHAT I WANT YOU TO FOCUS

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.047
ON FOR ME IS THAT I'VE WATCHING

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.281
THIS FOR A LONG TIME THERE'S A

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:53.749
LOT OF KIDS I THINK ARE CUTTING

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:55.051
TO MUCH WEIGHT YEAH.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:56.686
AND THEY'RE NOT STRONG.

01:05:56.752 --> 01:05:57.620
THEY THEY GET WEEK WHAT WE NEED

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:58.321
TO TRACK IT OVER TIME WE NEED TO

01:05:58.387 --> 01:05:59.322
WE NEED TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT

01:05:59.388 --> 01:06:00.790
WORKS FROM THAT MY SON'S BEEN

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:01.724
RUSSELL SAYS HE'S THREE YEARS

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:02.391
OLD.

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:03.626
NOW THOSE WERE JUST LITTLE ROLL

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:05.261
AROUND COUPLE ROUNDS YOU KNOW

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:06.929
AND HE WAS OUT OF THERE.

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:09.231
AND THEN THE KID WAS DINNER ALL

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:10.700
BREAKS BY WEIGHT.

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:11.534
WHAT WHAT YOU ARE DOESN'T MATTER

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.069
YOUR AGE HE'S A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:14.704

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:16.772
YEAR OLD MEN?

BECAUSE A THEIR SAME WEIGHT.

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:20.576
SO I I THINK WE NEED OUT

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:21.644
SOMETHING THAT GOES ALL THE WAY

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:22.845
THROUGH BECAUSE IF YOU DO THIS

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.747
PRACTICE A LONG TIME OVER TIME

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:26.515
WE NEED TO CHARGE TRACK AND SEE

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:28.451
WE STARTED SEEING.

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:29.952
YOU KNOW INJURIES.

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:31.821
KIDS PASSED OUT OVER THE YEARS

01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:34.490
FIELDS FOR HEAT STROKE ALL THESE

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:35.858
THINGS ARE COME TO OUR ATTENTION.

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.493
BECAUSE OUR SPORTS ARE GETTING

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:40.930
MORE COULD EVEN YOUNGER KIDS ARE

01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:43.466

IN PLACE THAT WE CAN TRACK AND

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:53.676

01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:47.395
IN IN THE FUTURE WE MIGHT HAVE

01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:49.597
THE OPPORTUNITY --

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:51.066
TO EXPLORE --

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:52.467
FIRE ARM --

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:54.269
APPLICATIONS AGAIN THROUGH

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:55.670
BREEZE NOW THAT BREEZE HAS

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:57.639
SETTLED DOWN AND BECOMING A MORE

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:59.174
FIRM --

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.409
PLATFORM FOR US --

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:04.212
TO UTILIZE AND WE LOOK FORWARD

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:05.080
TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:05.280
THAT.

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:07.382
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SAY EXCESSIVE

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:08.616
DEFICIENCIES ARE WE TALKING

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:09.884
ABOUT A LIMITATION OF THE

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:11.386
PREVIOUS PLATFORMERS A SOMETHING

01:23:11.453 --> 01:23:12.420
THAT WAS A DEFICIENCY IN THE

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:13.955
APPLICATION THEY WERE IN THE

01:23:14.022 --> 01:23:16.024
APPLICATIONS IN THE PROCESSING?

01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:17.759
OF THE APPLICATIONS YES NO WE

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:19.427
HAVE WE HAVE REASON WE'RE USING

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:21.529
THE BREEZE PLATFORM AND IT IS --

01:23:21.596 --> 01:23:23.631
EXPEDITING OUR APPLICATIONS FOR

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.667
ALL OTHER AREAS THAT WERE USING

01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:29.437
IT WITH I'M SORRY I'M I'M STILL

01:23:29.504 --> 01:23:31.139
NOT FOLLOWING YOU SO THE WHEN

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:31.940

01:23:32.006 --> 01:23:33.274
DEFICIENCIES ARE YOU TALK IS A

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:34.242
SOMETHING THAT IN THE PLATFORM

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:35.243
THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:36.978
OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THE

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:38.580
APPLICANT IS GETTING WRONG.

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:39.614
IT'S IN THE FAULT OF THE

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:43.017
APPLICANT I WOULD YOU NOT I MEAN

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:44.586
IT STANDS TO REASON THAT IT

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:45.887
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PLATFORM

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:48.256
YOU'RE HOSTING APPLICATION ON IF.

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:49.324
YOU'RE APPLICANTS CERTAIN ARE

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:50.658
CREATING THESE DEFICIENCIES WHY

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:51.760
WOULD YOU NOT THE ENTRANT WISE

01:23:51.826 --> 01:23:53.661
AT A REASON NOT TO TRANSITION

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:55.497
THAT TO BREEZE.

01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:57.766
IT WAS WE HAD IT IN BREEZE WE

01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:59.234
TOOK IT OUT TO ACCEPT HELP

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:02.971
EXPEDITE THOSE DEFICIENCIES.

01:24:03.037 --> 01:24:04.606
AND THEN AND NOW THAT.

01:24:04.672 --> 01:24:06.307
WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN THE

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:08.443
BREEZE FOR A WHILE WE'RE HOPING

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:10.011
THAT WE CAN MIGRATED WE ARE

01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:12.046
LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:14.949
MIGRATING AT THAT TO BREEZE

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:18.019
[inaudible] FIVE HELLO IF I MAY

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:19.788
I WANTED TO SAY --

01:24:19.854 --> 01:24:22.290
THERE WAS A 50% ERROR RATE AND

01:24:22.357 --> 01:24:23.458
SO WERE LOOKING AT THE

01:24:23.525 --> 01:24:25.527
DEFICIENCIES MORE CLOSELY TO SEE

01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:28.463
HOW WE CAN EDUCATE THE INDUSTRY --

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:31.299
AND ALSO LOOKING WHEN WE GO BACK

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:34.636
TO TRY TO AUTOMATE THIS IT WILL

01:24:34.702 --> 01:24:36.504
BE A LESSER DEFICIENCY RATE.

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:37.739
OKAY -- YEAH

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:39.040
I I WANNA SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:40.108
THIS MAY WE CAN TAKE IT OFF LINE

01:24:40.175 --> 01:24:41.209
AS I'M STILL FAILING TO

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:42.343
UNDERSTAND HOW THE BREEZE

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:44.679
PLATFORM IS CONTRIBUTING.

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:45.246
TO THE DEFICIENCIES IN THE

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:46.281
APPLICATIONS --

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:47.882
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME PERMITS SO

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:49.951
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:50.518
YOU DON'T TRACK ON BREEZE IS

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:55.557
THAT CORRECT?

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:56.691
SO THE BATON PERMITS ARE

01:24:56.758 --> 01:24:57.292
ACTUALLY ISSUED BY THE BATON

01:24:57.358 --> 01:24:59.093
TRAINING FACILITIES --

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.629
WE ISSUE THOSE LICENCES TO THE

01:25:01.696 --> 01:25:02.964
BIRTH BATON FACILITIES AND THEN

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:04.532
WHEN THE APPLICANT COMPLETE THE

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:05.700
TRAINING.

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:06.468
THEY ACTUALLY ISSUE TO THE

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:08.369
LICENSEE BY THE FACILITY BASED

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:09.637
MET A LESS TO US.

01:25:09.704 --> 01:25:11.573
AND THEN WE WILL --

01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:14.209
UPDATE THAT IN THE OKAY SO THAT

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:15.343
THAT'S THAT FALLS INTO THE

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:17.479
CATEGORY OF THINGS THAT YOU

01:25:17.545 --> 01:25:18.713
DON'T EXPECT THEM THEY DON'T

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:19.581
HAVE ACCESS TO BRUCE YOU DON'T

01:25:19.647 --> 01:25:21.583
EXPECT THAT THOSE PERMITS. TO BE

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:22.217
ISSUED THROUGH BREEZE FOR THAT

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:22.917
REASON.

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:23.952
AND THAT IS A DIRECT RESULT

01:25:24.018 --> 01:25:25.119
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE PRACTICE

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:28.590
ACT REQUIRES US TO ISSUE THE THE

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:29.491
TIME PERMITS ALL RIGHT WELL

01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:30.525
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:31.459
APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD GET BACK

01:25:31.526 --> 01:25:32.694
TO ME ON THAT THE FIREARMS

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.329
PERMITS BECAUSE WE'RE JUST WE'RE

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:35.964
GRAPPLING WITH A LARGER ISSUE.

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:37.632
OF BREEZE AT HOW TO SUBMIT MOST

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:39.400
EFFICIENTLY MAKE THAT WORK FOR

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:41.035
ALL OF THE DC A AGENCIES THAT

01:25:41.102 --> 01:25:42.036
WANT TO USE IT.

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:42.837
AND SO -- IT

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:44.005
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:45.874
IF THERE'S A LIMITATION THE

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:47.275
PLATFORM THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS.

01:25:47.342 --> 01:25:48.643
WE WILL DO THAT THANK YOU.

01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:50.311

ENFORCEMENT OR FORMER LAW

01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:30.184
ENFORCEMENT WHEN THEY APPLY.

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:33.321
THEY SELF IDENTIFY AS BEING --

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:34.355
ONE FORCE IN A NOT.

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:35.857

PART OF OUR FITNESS FOR

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:51.105
LICENSURE WHEN WE DO OUR REVIEW.

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:52.774
IT SEEMS TO BE A PRETTY REACTIVE.

SO HERE WE HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.410

WEAPON AND BE LICENSED.

01:27:00.815 --> 01:27:02.417

INVESTIGATORS ARE.

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:42.503
THERE AGENCY IS LICENSED AND NOT

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:45.006
THE INDIVIDUAL NAME LICENSED.

01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:46.941
THAT THAT WAS ELIMINATED IN THE

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:48.609
PRE SYSTEM IT'S A PROBLEM IT'S A

01:30:48.676 --> 01:30:50.077
HUGE PROBLEM FOR US IT'S A

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:52.380
CONSUMER PROTECTION PROBLEM FOR

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:52.547
US.

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:56.450
IF OF IF I HAVE AN ATTORNEY THAT

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:56.984

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:00.021
MY NAME.

01:31:00.087 --> 01:31:01.222
THEN HE WOULD.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:04.125
THINK I WAS COMMITTING FRAUD

01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:05.893
BECAUSE HE'S LIKE ON ME NORMALLY

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.195
AND ATTORNEY WOULD NOT KNOW MY

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:08.529
BUSINESS NAME IS SPECIAL

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:10.598
CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WOULD ONLY

HAS BECOME A SERIOUS.

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:16.838
CONSUMER PURPLE PROTECTION

01:31:16.904 --> 01:31:20.741
PROBLEM FOR US AS WELL AS IF

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:23.444
THERE'S UNLICENSED AT OUR

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:25.279
ASSOCIATION DOES OUR OWN

01:31:25.346 --> 01:31:26.480
UNLICENSED ACTIVITIES

01:31:26.547 --> 01:31:27.915
INVESTIGATION BEFORE IT GETS

01:31:27.982 --> 01:31:29.183
REFERRED TO THE BUREAU.

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:31.018
AND WE CANNOT LOOK THEM UP BY

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:31.819
THEIR PERSONAL NAME.

01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:34.021
THAT THE PROBLEM TO THE SECOND

01:31:34.088 --> 01:31:36.791
IS -- THE

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:39.760
ENHANCED IDENTIFICATION CARD.

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:42.697
SO CURRENTLY WE GET A PAPER CARD

01:31:42.763 --> 01:31:44.966

EXPIRATION DATE.

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:51.138
THEN AS AN OPTION WE CAN GO --

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:52.373
TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCREENING

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:55.877

BUT THERE'S NO EXPIRATION DATE.

01:32:00.481 --> 01:32:01.983
SO THEREFORE WE HAVE TO CARRY

01:32:02.049 --> 01:32:03.718
TWO CARDS WE WANT TO HAVE A AYE

01:32:03.784 --> 01:32:06.220

WE WOULD LIKE THOSE MERGED INTO

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.693
ONE ONE HARD CARD THAT WOULD

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:15.029
HAVE OUR PHOTO ON IT --

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:16.964
THE BEST EXAMPLE I CAN USES THE

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:18.733

HOLOGRAMS AND ALL THE BELLS AND

01:32:21.535 --> 01:32:23.905
WHISTLES BUT A PHOTO ID CARD

01:32:23.971 --> 01:32:25.539
WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE AND OUR

01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:26.440
NAME WOULD BE.

01:32:26.507 --> 01:32:32.213
OF SUPER SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM --

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.614
I'VE GOT A COUPLE MORE ISSUES

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:34.715

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:16.724
RISKS TO THE CONSUMER.

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.793
WE WE ACTUALLY HAVE VERY

01:33:18.859 --> 01:33:20.962
SENSITIVE INFORMATION.

02:15:19.444 --> 02:15:21.680
EFFECTIVENESS IN TRYING TO

02:15:21.746 --> 02:15:22.747
MINIMIZE.

02:15:22.814 --> 02:15:24.249
FRY PARTICULAR THESE CASES OF

02:15:24.316 --> 02:15:26.785
DISASTER HOW CAN WE ASSESS THAT

02:15:26.852 --> 02:15:27.986
HOW HOW DO YOU ASSESS IT WELL

02:15:28.053 --> 02:15:29.588
THE FIRST WAY WE WOULD ASSESS

02:15:29.654 --> 02:15:30.622
THAT IS THAT WE GO BACK TO THE

02:15:30.689 --> 02:15:31.756
NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE AND WE

02:15:31.823 --> 02:15:35.460
THAT WAS IN THE EIGHTIES. NINETY

02:15:35.527 --> 02:15:36.461
FOUR EIGHTY NINE FOR A FOR THE

02:15:36.528 --> 02:15:39.397
AMOUNT OF EIGHTY FOUR YEAH.

02:15:39.464 --> 02:15:42.467
SO IN THE NURSERY AND ARE THERE

02:15:42.534 --> 02:15:43.602
HAVE.

02:15:43.668 --> 02:15:44.269
NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE WE DIDN'T

02:15:44.336 --> 02:15:44.903
HAVE THIS TYPE OF AN APPROACH I

02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:46.304
WAS THAT TIME WORKING FOR THE

02:15:46.371 --> 02:15:47.639
CONTRACTORS POOR WE DIDN'T HAVE

02:15:47.706 --> 02:15:48.139
THAT KIND OF APPROACH.

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:49.374
AND WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IS A WE

02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:51.109
RECEIVED A SO MANY CONSUMER

02:15:51.176 --> 02:15:52.677
COMPLAINTS SO WE HAD TO OPEN A

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:54.412
BRANCH OFFICE TO HANDLE THEM ALL.

02:15:54.479 --> 02:15:55.747
THE COMPLAINTS FILED BY

02:15:55.814 --> 02:15:57.582
CONSUMERS WERE OVERWHELMING AND

02:15:57.649 --> 02:15:58.984
THAT'S WHEN WE REALIZED THAT

02:15:59.050 --> 02:16:00.519
WHEN THERE IS A DISASTER WE NEED

02:16:00.585 --> 02:16:02.220
TO HAVE MORE OF A PREVENTIVE

02:16:02.287 --> 02:16:03.955
APPROACH WE NEED TO BE OUT THERE

02:16:04.022 --> 02:16:05.090
PUTTING THE INFORMATION OUT.

02:16:05.156 --> 02:16:06.358
JUST HELPING IS CONSUMERS

02:16:06.424 --> 02:16:07.893
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY NEED TO

02:16:07.959 --> 02:16:08.960
THEY NEED TO TAKE TIME AND

02:16:09.027 --> 02:16:10.695
SELECTING THE CONTRACT NOT RUSH

02:16:10.762 --> 02:16:12.931
INTO SOMETHING SO WHAT WE FIRST

02:16:12.998 --> 02:16:15.267
LOOK AT US. FOR BEING SUCCESSFUL

02:16:15.333 --> 02:16:18.136
IN LARGE PART IS IN TO US SAYING

02:16:18.203 --> 02:16:19.271
THEY'VE BEEN FINANCIALLY HARM

02:16:19.337 --> 02:16:20.939
THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

02:16:21.006 --> 02:16:22.340
IT'S ALSO WORKING WITH THE

02:16:22.407 --> 02:16:23.241
BUILDING DEPARTMENTS TO ENSURE

02:16:23.308 --> 02:16:24.409
THE CONTRACTORS OBTAINING THE

02:16:24.476 --> 02:16:25.977
PERMITS ARE APPROPRIATELY

02:16:26.044 --> 02:16:27.579
LICENSED IN THAT WE DON'T HAVE

02:16:27.646 --> 02:16:28.847
THEIR SIZE THEIR SIGNS TO

02:16:28.914 --> 02:16:31.416
IDENTIFY UNLICENSED ACTIVITY.

02:16:31.483 --> 02:16:31.983
YOU KNOW WHAT THE BILL IN

02:16:32.050 --> 02:16:33.218
APARTMENT ONE WOULD BE AN OWNER

02:16:33.285 --> 02:16:34.185
BUILDER PERMIT YOU DON'T WANT TO

02:16:34.252 --> 02:16:35.487
SEE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE A

02:16:35.554 --> 02:16:36.254
PERMANENT WORK.

02:16:36.321 --> 02:16:37.889
AND THEN FROM OUR INDUSTRY

02:16:37.956 --> 02:16:39.257
PARTNERS THAT ARE OBTAINING

02:16:39.324 --> 02:16:39.925
THESE ARE TRYING TO OBTAIN THESE

02:16:39.991 --> 02:16:41.560
CONTRACTS ARE THEY REPORTING

02:16:41.626 --> 02:16:42.827
THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN

02:16:42.894 --> 02:16:44.162
THE CONTRACTORS ARE LOSING A TO

02:16:44.229 --> 02:16:45.330
AN UNLICENSED PERSON.

02:16:45.397 --> 02:16:46.898
BUT THE NUMBER ONE THING IS

02:16:46.965 --> 02:16:48.433
HEARING FROM THE CONSUMERS WHO

02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:50.168
WE SERVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:16:50.235 --> 02:16:51.870
THEY'RE NOT BEING VICTIMIZED IN

02:16:51.937 --> 02:16:52.370
COMING TO US WITH THESE

02:16:52.437 --> 02:16:54.139
COMPLAINTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE

02:16:54.205 --> 02:16:55.640
HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST FEW YEARS.

02:16:55.707 --> 02:16:59.010
BECAUSE WE HAVE TAKEN A

02:16:59.077 --> 02:16:59.945
PROACTIVE APPROACH.

02:17:00.011 --> 02:17:02.247
WELL THAT THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR --

02:17:02.314 --> 02:17:03.515
AND I'M CERTAINLY AM ENCOURAGED

02:17:03.582 --> 02:17:06.251
BY YOUR OPTIMISM.

02:17:06.318 --> 02:17:07.986
THAT TACK THAT CONSUMERS ARE

02:17:08.053 --> 02:17:11.323
BETTER PROTECTED NOW --

02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:12.857
MAYBE SWITCHING GEARS UP FOR A

02:17:12.924 --> 02:17:13.391
MOMENT --

02:17:13.458 --> 02:17:15.060
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN ABOUT

02:17:15.126 --> 02:17:17.395
THE THE CONTRACTORS BOND AMOUNT

02:17:17.462 --> 02:17:19.264
A FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:17:19.331 --> 02:17:20.498
AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS A

02:17:20.565 --> 02:17:21.967
SUFFICIENT.

02:17:22.033 --> 02:17:22.567
OR NOT COULD YOU COMMENT UPON

02:17:22.634 --> 02:17:25.170
THAT.

02:17:25.236 --> 02:17:27.205
WELL I I BELIEVE A SOMETHING

02:17:27.272 --> 02:17:27.772
THAT OUR BOARD WOULD LIKE TO

02:17:27.839 --> 02:17:31.309
LOOK AT WE HAVE AN AND PRIOR

02:17:31.376 --> 02:17:33.111
SUNSET REFUSED TO DISCUSS

02:17:33.178 --> 02:17:34.813
RAISING THE BOND AND DURING

02:17:34.879 --> 02:17:35.680
THOSE --

02:17:35.747 --> 02:17:36.915
HEARINGS THAT THERE WAS

02:17:36.982 --> 02:17:37.916
OPPOSITION FROM SOME OF THE

02:17:37.983 --> 02:17:39.217
INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE OF

02:17:39.284 --> 02:17:40.952
THE REQUIREMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO

02:17:41.019 --> 02:17:42.053
PERFORM UNDER WRITING.

02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:43.021
BUT I DO THINK IT'S SOMETHING

02:17:43.088 --> 02:17:44.656
THAT I THINK OUR BOARD WOULD BE

02:17:44.723 --> 02:17:46.891
INTERESTED IN CONSIDERING A

02:17:46.958 --> 02:17:48.827
KEVIN --

02:17:48.893 --> 02:17:49.361
MARLOWE WHICH LIKE TO ADD

02:17:49.427 --> 02:17:51.296
SOMETHING TO THAT.

02:17:51.363 --> 02:17:51.997
NO I THINK IT'S SOME WE

02:17:52.063 --> 02:17:52.697
DEFINITELY LOOK AT CONSIDERING --

02:17:52.764 --> 02:17:54.132
YOU KNOW FIFTEEN THOUSAND IS NOT

02:17:54.199 --> 02:17:55.166
A HUGE DOLLAR AMOUNT TO HARM

02:17:55.233 --> 02:17:57.168
CONSUMER YEAH WE'RE ALSO LOOKING

02:17:57.235 --> 02:17:58.103
AT TRYING TO KEEP THE BARRIERS

02:17:58.169 --> 02:17:59.671
TO LICENSURE DOWN --

02:17:59.738 --> 02:18:00.605
IN ALLOW PEOPLE INTO THE

02:18:00.672 --> 02:18:02.073
QUALIFIED PEOPLE INTO THE

02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:03.775
INDUSTRY SO I THINK THAT'S THE

02:18:03.842 --> 02:18:04.976
BALANCE IF I REMEMBER RIGHT

02:18:05.043 --> 02:18:06.645
COUPLE YEARS AGO WE INCREASED.

02:18:06.711 --> 02:18:09.314
THE BOND AMOUNT TO FIFTEEN

02:18:09.381 --> 02:18:11.616
THOUSAND FROM --

02:18:11.683 --> 02:18:12.250
TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND

02:18:12.317 --> 02:18:14.286
ELIMINATED THE THE AN

02:18:14.352 --> 02:18:15.887
OPPORTUNITY --

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:17.389
FOR CONTRACTORS SO THAT THAT

02:18:17.455 --> 02:18:18.690
WOULD BE OUR BALANCE --

02:18:18.757 --> 02:18:19.357
AND IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO

02:18:19.424 --> 02:18:22.193
LOOK AT AND AND WHAT'S THE COST

02:18:22.260 --> 02:18:23.595
TO IT CONTRACTOR OF THE BOND.

02:18:23.662 --> 02:18:25.363
TYPICALLY.

02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:28.933
AT THAT LEVEL OF FIFTEEN

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:29.401
THOUSAND I I WOULD BE

02:18:29.467 --> 02:18:30.802
SPECULATING I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S

02:18:30.869 --> 02:18:33.071
MUCH BUT I THINK THE CONCERN --

02:18:33.138 --> 02:18:34.739
AS REGISTRAR FULL POINTED OUT

02:18:34.806 --> 02:18:36.107

02:18:36.174 --> 02:18:37.842
THE ABILITY FOR CONTRACTORS TO

02:18:37.909 --> 02:18:38.376

02:22:03.915 --> 02:22:05.183
ENSURING THAT THEIR CONTRACTOR

OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.

02:22:22.634 --> 02:22:25.136
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE HAVE

02:22:25.203 --> 02:22:25.837
WORKED WITH QUITE A FEW

02:22:25.904 --> 02:22:27.972
REGISTRARS AND QUITE A FEW STAFF

02:22:28.039 --> 02:22:29.207
THROUGH THE YEARS.

02:22:29.274 --> 02:22:30.441
AND I'VE GOT TO TAKE MY HAT OFF

02:22:30.508 --> 02:22:31.542
THAT I THINK THAT THEY'RE

02:22:31.609 --> 02:22:33.478
FINALLY AT A POINT WHERE THEY'RE

02:22:33.544 --> 02:22:35.280
REALLY DOING WELL WE HAVE A LOT

02:22:35.346 --> 02:22:36.681
OF CHALLENGES THE UNDERGROUND

02:22:36.748 --> 02:22:37.348
ECONOMY.

02:22:37.415 --> 02:22:39.450
IS HUGE WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS

02:22:39.517 --> 02:22:40.785
THAT THEY'RE LITERALLY EATING

02:22:40.852 --> 02:22:42.587
THE LAUNCH OF THE LEGITIMATE

02:22:42.654 --> 02:22:44.289
CONTRACTORS IN THE STATE AND

02:22:44.355 --> 02:22:45.690
WE'VE GOT A ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES.

02:22:45.757 --> 02:22:47.792
COME OUT WITH OF OTHER WAYS OF

02:22:47.859 --> 02:22:49.160
ENFORCEMENT --

02:22:49.227 --> 02:22:50.929
AFTER THESE TYPES OF PEOPLES BUT

02:22:50.995 --> 02:22:51.996
I THINK THE LICENSE BOARD'S

02:22:52.063 --> 02:22:53.531
DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB.

02:22:53.598 --> 02:22:54.866
IN TERMS OF THE BONDS YOU'RE

02:22:54.933 --> 02:22:56.334
TALKING ABOUT THE FIFTEEN

02:22:56.401 --> 02:22:57.568
THOUSAND DOLLAR BOND YOU MAY NOT

02:22:57.635 --> 02:22:59.537
KNOW THIS BUT THE ACTUAL AMOUNT

02:22:59.604 --> 02:23:01.673
THAT THE CONSUMER CAN CLAIM OUT

02:23:01.739 --> 02:23:03.574
OF THAT BOND IS ONLY SEVENTY

02:23:03.641 --> 02:23:04.042
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

02:23:04.108 --> 02:23:06.311
SO YOU MAY HAVE A FIFTEEN

02:23:06.377 --> 02:23:06.878
THOUSAND DOLLAR BOND BUT THE

02:23:06.945 --> 02:23:08.479
ACTUAL AMOUNT IS FAR LESS THAN

02:23:08.546 --> 02:23:09.213
THAT.

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:11.082
AND I THINK THAT DOES NEED TO BE

02:23:11.149 --> 02:23:14.419
LOOKED AT IT'S AS WELL THAT I

02:23:14.485 --> 02:23:16.020

THAT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE

02:23:22.427 --> 02:23:23.161
WANT TO MAKE.

02:23:23.227 --> 02:23:24.796
SURE THAT CONSUMERS PROTECTED SO

02:23:24.862 --> 02:23:26.230

02:23:26.297 --> 02:23:27.432
OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE.
