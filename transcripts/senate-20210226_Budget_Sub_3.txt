AS A RESULT OF THESE EFFORTS WEEK QUICKLY STARTED TO SEE. A DECLINE IN THE CODE RED POSITIVE STAFF AND PATIENTS ACROSS OUR FACILITY. OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC THEM THROUGH THE END OF JANUARY WE HAD A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN PATIENTS STATEWIDE WHO HAVE BEEN POSITIVE FOR THE NINETEEN. DECEMBER AND JANUARY STARTS OUT REALLY WENT INTO. THE SYSTEM. ALSO DURING THE SEARCH WE DID EXPERIENCE STAFFING CHALLENGES AND THAT'S WHERE WASN'T THE RESULT OF THE HIGH NUMBER AND STAFF AND FACTIONS- AND THAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING WE DID WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. EMERGENCY NURSING STAFFING. AND SURE THAT WE WERE MEETING I'M NURSING A REQUIRED NURSING RATIOS ALSO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR STOP WORKING. MANDATED OVERTIME.

NO THAT'S ALL THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO. WHAT A JOURNEY HUH A YEAR AGO I AT MY BIRTHDAY IS ON MARCH THIRD WHICH ALSO HAPPEN TO BE THE ELECTION LAST YEAR AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME. THEY WERE OUT WITHOUT THESE OUT IN PUBLIC AND I'M I'M JUST REFLECTING AS NEXT YEAR'S MARCH MY BIRTHDAY. ABOUT THE JOURNEY TO THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN ON TOGETHER. AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE TRYING TO. YOU KNOW JUST IN THE COMMUNITY IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO KEEP TRYING TO MAINTAIN SAFETY IN A- IN A- IN AN INPATIENT FACILITY I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE. SO HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO SO MUCH BETTER THAN CITY RC AS WITH THE SPREAD. AND TRANSMISSION- RELATIVELY I MEAN YOU STILL HAVE QUITE A FEW DEATHS AND A LOT ABOUT BREAK. BUT BUT YOU SEEM TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MITIGATE IT TO A CERTAIN DEGREE CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT. I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN OUR SYSTEM ON IN. THE YEAH WE ARE HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENTS BY NATURE AND WE ARE ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS YOU KNOW WE PRIMARILY EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. AS SO WE ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND IN ENVIRONMENTS- FROM CDC ARE. BUT ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW WE WORK REALLY HARD AS A TEAM AND COLLABORATING REALLY CLOSELY WITH OPERATE DEPARTMENT. HEALTH AND I WORKED. AND TO REALLY DEVELOP PROTOCOLS AROUND ALL OF THE FACTORS AS WE DISCUSSED ON THE IN IMPLEMENTING INFECTION CONTROL MEASURES. I WE EVEN PARTNERED WITH CDC ARE EONS OF THAT. ASSOCIATION AND IN EUROPE I'M STATEWIDE. TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS THE BILL MENTIONED THAT EARLIER AND TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS TO HELP THREE. ATHLETES FRAMES FOR PATIENTS BETWEEN OUR FACILITIES BECAUSE WE DO SO MUCH OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE TREAT OUR MOVE IN AND OUT OF THOSE FACILITIES AS WELL. SO AND THEY'VE BEEN GREAT PARTNERS IN TRYING ZERO AND HELP. US AS WELL AS THEM MITIGATE THE RISK OF MOVING PATIENT. OR DID YOU. DID YOU YOU AND I THINK YOU'RE I THINK OF YOU DID THAT HAVING STEPS TO IN HOTEL. IN ORDER TO GET RID THE THIS AN ARRAY. WE DID OFFER THE HOTEL I FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. BIRDS AND WE- ESTABLISH I'M IN. SUPPORT LINE- OUR ONE OF THE AND I STOCKS UP IS NOT A VERY. TIME FOR STOPPED. I WE TOGETHER TEAM SERVES AN EMPLOYEE SUPPORT LINE AND ANY OF OUR STAFF THAT MAY BE. I'M CHALLENGES AROUND I'M HOPING NINETEEN AND ONE OF AND THEY SERVICE BACK ON DO IT NOW TO THAT HEALTH CARE FOR ANY. EXCUSE ME HOTELS FOR HEALTHCARE. WORKERS THEY NEED THAT. AND CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE- VACCINATION HAS. IN YEARS 265% SAID YES AND THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. FOR THE MOST PART HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT AND DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE THAT CHANGE. ACTUALLY AS WE SEE THE SAME KIND OF. BEANS ARE BETWEEN BOTH OUR STAFF AND OUR PATIENTS WHICH IS NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE COMMUNITY REALLY WHICH IS AND YOU HAVE YOUR EARLY ADOPTERS SO WE CERTAINLY AYE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT WERE STANDING AT THE DOOR WAITING FOR THAT VACCINE TO COME IN THAT DAY WHEN IN THE FIRST IN OUR LIVES AND THAT REALLY WERE JUST SIGNING UP AND EAGER TO GET IT. ARE YOU WE HAD THOSE- WAIT AND SEE KIND OF FOLKS LET'S SEE HOW THE FIRST PEOPLE I RESPOND GET THEIR VACCINE AND THEN YOU HAVE INDIVIDUAL STORY AND TAKE BACK IN A VACCINATION AND SO- REGARDLESS OF THE OF WHAT VACCINE IT IS THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY'RE INTERESTED IN AND WE SEE THAT- FOR OUR PATIENTS AS WELL SO I THINK WORK WE CONTINUE TO EDUCATE OUR PATIENTS AND OUR STAFF AROUND THE VACCINE WE DEFINITELY CONTINUE TO OPERATE. AS A WEED IT WASN'T JUST A ONE TIME COME GET YOUR VACCINE THE WORD pTHAT PROCESS AND EVERY DAY WE GET MORE AND MORE BACK THAN IT'S BEEN I THINK IT'S JUST GOING TO BE CONTINUING JOURNEY WRITTEN. BACK PLEASE. OKAY M. I HAVE WHAT I SEEM. ANIMAL IT HAS OUR- I THINK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN THINK YOU HAVE CLEARLY HAVE YOUR HAND FULL AND- DIFFICULT TIME HERE BUT- I AM JUST. TO UNDER. WHY CDC ARE IS SENDING CODED NINETEEN PATIENTS HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THAT. BUT THEY'RE NOT AND INTENTIONALLY SENDING CODED AT NINETEEN POSITIVE PATIENTS SO YEAH- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS AND MAYBE I CAN TURN THIS OVER TO DOCTOR WERE WORKING VERY. REYES THAT SHE'S BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK WITH CDC ARE SENT THEY HAVE. A PROCESS TO. A BEFORE THEY TRAINING TO. OUR AND THEY HAVE HI- FACILITY THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED IN MID MAY AND WHEN HAS BEEN OUT IN THE HIS CELL THE NOT. PATIENTS AND WEEK CLEAR THEM TO. BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE WERE OF THAT IN THE THIS IS VERY. BUT NATURE OF HER NINETY IS THAT YOU CAN BE EXPOSED AND IT'S GOING TO BE CONTENT ONLY UP TO FOURTEEN DAYS BEFORE YOU BECOME POSITIVE. AND OR YOU MAY BE A SYMPTOMATIC AND WE DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE. AND SO THEY CAN HAVE SOMEBODY SAY EVERYBODY'S RECEIVED ITS HOUSE THE LAST THE PATIENT AS PREVIOUSLY YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T FORCE SOMEONE ASK BUT THAT'S A VERY SMALL NUMBER. AND BUT UNLESS THE- YOU KNOW THE PATIENT COULD TEST ONE DAY NEGATIVE. AND A COUPLE DAYS LATER WHEN THEY GET TO OUR MISSION OBSERVATION UNIT AND WE TRUST THEM THREE TIMES WHILE THEY'RE IN THE NATION OBSERVATION UNIT SO ONCE UPON ADMISSION. AGAIN I THAT SEVEN DAYS AND AGAIN A WORKING DAY MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVEN'T- AND DEVELOPED SILVA NINETEEN. WE MOVE THEM INTO OUR HOUSE. SO AND THEY CAN BECOME THROUGHOUT THAT FOURTEEN DAYS BECAUSE THEY WERE IN KEEPING AND NO ONE THEY HAD BEEN IN. SO I KNOW DR WEBER NAY ERRORS ON ANYTHING WORN WANT TO.

A BILL TO PREVENT THE IN BARELY STATUS IS THAT ARE PRO TWICE HONEST DAY AND- AND THAT WAS THE WITH THIS INTO BUT IT WAS A RARE AND WE DO HAVE THIS STATE THAT AND PROTOCOL THAT THAT TO ME I KNOW THIS WE WERE ABLE TO ISOLATE THE END OF THE OUT I'M HAVING IT NOW GREAT. YES THIS DOWNTURN MISSION OBSERVATION UNIT. FOR FOURTEEN DAYS DURING THAT SERIAL TESTING PROCESS AND AFTER THAT- IN MISSION PROCESS IS COMPLETED THEN THEY GO TO THEIR- I TREATMENT UNIT SO THIS WAS. AN UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE IT WAYS I. COMBINATION OF- THE PERSON'S LEGAL STATUS AND JUST THOSE THOSE ONE AND A MILLION CASES WHERE WHERE THAT TESTING PROTOCOL DID NOT CATCH THE INDIVIDUAL UNTIL THEY GOT TO US. YOU'RE A MUSICIAN- MELINDA'S. SORRY THANK YOU YOU FEEL- THE PROCESS NOW HAS BEEN REFINED ENOUGH THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. ABSOLUTELY YES. THANK YOU IN CONNECTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH OCTOPATH.

I DO HAVE A FEW I THE- FOLLOW UP ON- AND OF. THAT THE TERMS OF. TRACING AS YOU WERE. AT SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LEVEL YOU'RE ABLE CONTACT TRACING YOU HAD POSITIVES WITHIN THE STATE HOSPITALS- BUT- ARE YOU REACH YOUR GIVEN THE HOUSES THAT YOU HAD. YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WERE RELATED TO VIRUSES BEING BROUGHT IN FROM THE OUTSIDE INTO THE HOSPITAL VERSES INTERNAL SPREAD. SO SAID SO IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW THE CASES HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS BECAUSE AND DAYLIGHT AND CERTAINLY NO YOU DID A LOT OF EFFORTS TO TRY TO PREVENT INTERNAL SPREAD BUT- YEAH. IN TERMS OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE- OCTOBER IT CAME FROM- HOW HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS INTERNAL SPREAD VERSUS SOMEONE BRING IT YEP YOU BRING IN FROM OUTSIDE SO WHETHER IT'S A PATIENT TRANSFER R. OR- STAFF- IT. GIVEN COMMITTEE RATES AT CETERA- WITH CONTACT WE ABLE TO DO ENOUGH DETAIL CONTACT TRACING TO BE OLD A FIGHT. THIS INFORMATION. SO WE DEFINITELY DO CONTACT FOR YOU SEEN AROUND EACH INTERACTION AND TO IDENTIFY WHO WITH IN THE FACILITY MIGHT. HAVE IF YOU. AT IF AN INDIVIDUAL LET'S SAY AN EMPLOYEE TESTS POSITIVE AND THEN WE DEFINITELY DID A CONTACT FREE SEEN A DENTIST FIVE TWO I'LL THEY ARE. BEEN INCOME. WITH I WITHIN OUR FACILITIES AND GRAND I. THINK THIS GUY SO- YOU SAID YOU TACAN US WITH THE FIRST. BUT FOR EXAMPLE YES WHO WORK AT THE FACILITY SO THEY'RE ENTERED BUT THEY ALSO INTERFACE WITH THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE SO ARE YOU ABLE TO CONTRACT. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DO CONTACT TRACING IT'S ALL THE CONTACTS IT'S NOT JUST SO. YOU KNOW STAFF PERSON YOU DON'T JUST CONTACT REYES WHO THEY GOT CONNECTED TO WITHIN THE FACILITY IT'S ALSO WILL BE CONTACTED WHEN HE WENT HOME OR WHEN THEY WENT SHOPPING AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO WE WILL DO THAT LEVEL CONTACT TRACING. SO WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTACT FOR YOU SEEN WITHIN OUR FACILITY AND THEN THE PUBLIC THAT THEY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DOES THE RIGHT. THERE REMAIN. IN PREDICT OKAY WELL- IN YOUR COLLABORATION WITH YOUR LOVED HEALTH THE- WERE YOU ABLE TO GET THAT KIND OF. I REALIZE IS THERE PRIVACY IS IN TERMS OF ACTUAL PEOPLE BEING TO. FIGURE OUT. WHERE YOU KNOW WE DE VIRUS FROM WHEN YOU AN OUTBREAK IT'S STILL TO BE A TO DO THAT. SAREJEVO INTEGRATE THAT. I KNOW I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT FIRST AND OF THAT CASES MORE INTERNAL COURSES AND THAT THANK YOU VERY DE TO GET TO PARTICULARLY WE BRING OUT OF RATE OF TRYING- YOU KNOW TRY AND TRANSFER WORK ON OUR ON AB PARTICULARLY DURING NIGHT OF DECEMBER AND JANUARY FRAME- BUT WE DO UTILIZE CONTACT FREEZING TO REALLY TRY TO IDENTIFY WHERE WITH THAT ARE. AS WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR I CONTAINMENT EFFORTS TO FOREIGN SINCE PAST AND- THAT TO TEST I DON'T WE HAVE IN THAT IS A OKAY SO I GUESS I WOULD INCORPORATE HELP FOR PANDEMIC AS MUCH AS DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT AS WELL TRYING TO DO WITH THIS ONE- WE SHOULD BE OF. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PROTOCOL AND HOW WE BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE OPERATED. AND AND- SO- I THINK THAT THOSE AT THE NAME IS MORE ABOUT LESSONS ABOUT HOW WE- TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DOES SO WE CAN GET THAT KIND OF INFORMATION SO IN THE FUTURE PANDEMIC. HOPEFUL WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER SPIKE OF THIS ONE- WE'RE CROSSING FINGERS WERE THE VACCINE AND FORTH. BUT BE ABLE TO THE FACT- NOW. WE HAVE TO RELY THAT THE INSTITUTION ONSEN BUBBLE HAVE STAFF THAT WORK AND COMMUTE ARE THERE YOU HAVE PEOPLE CAME. IN AND YET WE'VE ACTUALLY PEOPLE TO. OUT AND SO- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE WITHIN THE INSTITUTION BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS- WITH ORGANIZATIONS OUT. SIDE THE INSTITUTION THAT MY IN DEPTH- AND I GUESS THE- YEP THE NEXT QUESTION I HAVE A APPRECIATE AGAIN YOU PROVIDE THE INFORMATION- I NOTE THAT YOU SAID FIFTY FIVE PATIENTS HAVE DIED SINCE MAY THIRTIETH I DON'T KNOW IF THE REASON YOU PICK MAY THIRTY IT'S BECAUSE THAT WAS THE FIRST DEATH VERSUS. OR ANY THAT'S PRIOR TO MAY THIRTIETH SO MUCH OF WHAT THE SO YOU CAN CLARIFY THAT BUT HAVE WE ALSO IDENTIFIED WERE THERE ANY DEBTS OF STAFF RELATED TO OUTBREAKS- THAT MIGHT HAVE ORIGINATED FROM WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS SO YOU KNOW YOU'VE HAD- MANY POSITIVE STAFF AND- PATIENTS- DESPITE YOUR BEST EFFORTS- WERE THERE DO WE KNOW IF ANY STAFF WHO ENDED UP DYING. BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPOSED. TO THE VIRUS WHILE AT WORK. THOSE TWO THINGS FOR ME. LIKE WANT TO I JUST GOT TO THE FIRE. WRITTEN JUST FIVE FIND WE DO WORK REALLY CLOSE WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT WERE NOT WORKING. A BAND WORKING WITH US CONSOLE ARM. INTERACTION AND- AND TRANSMISSION WE'RE GONNA HOSPITAL AND OUR OF THE TEAM AT IN IN MANY AREAS HAVE. HAVE WITH THE TEAM AT OUT PART IN BACK TO SEE IF HAVE BEEN INTO OUR FACILITY AND BY. AS WELL. THERE DEFINITELY ESTABLISH RELATIONS THE PERFECT PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS THEY JUST WANTED TO ASSURE YOU THAT THERE IS THAT. COLLABORATION AT GOING ON THE COMMUNITY. WE DO HAVE IN. AND THAT OFTEN COMMUNITY THAT. OPERATE IN RIGHT- BUT JEFF ON THE. YEAH OKAY SO ARE YOU ABLE TO SPEAK TO HOW MANY STAFF MIGHT HAVE EITHER DIED OR BEEN HOSPITALIZED BECAUSE EXPOSURES AT WORK. FROM COVERED SO I KNOW YOU GAVE YOU HAVE A STATISTICS YOU PROVIDE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PATIENTS HAVE DIED- I NOTE THAT YOU REPORTED ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TEN STAFF TESTED POSITIVE BUT DOING THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE TEST TESTING POSITIVE AND AGAIN THIS GOES BACK TO YOU. I THINK MY FIRST QUESTION AND I DO APPRECIATE AND ENSURE THAT YOU DO TRY TO WORK WITH THE PUBLIC BUT I MEAN THIS IS TALK ABOUT INTEGRATING THE INFORMATION RIGHT SO YOU HAVE A HOSPITAL. GRADE YES PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE THEY LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY- SO ARE WE INTEGRATING OUR DATA IN A WAY SO THAT WE WOULD KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IF THE I THINK THE COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT WANT TO KNOW IF THERE WERE OUTBREAKS GOING HOSPITAL IS THAT GOING TO CAUSE OUTBREAKS GOING ON OUTSIDE AND YOU DON'T INTELLIGENCE OUTBREAKS IN THE COMMUNITY. ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING NOW THEY'RE PICKING IT UP AND GO. WHEREVER PLACE THEY ARE AND THEN THEY BRING IT INTO WORK IT'S ADDRESS SO- SO I GUESS YOU KNOW IN RELATION TO THAT- OF THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TEN STAFF IT DID TO END UP TESTING POSITIVE DAY IN THEM IN THE HOSPITALIZED. OR DYING FROM COATED. YES WE DID HAVE SOME. IS VERY FEW HOW. AND- AS IN THE- THREE. THAT THREE THREE THAT'S OKAY ALL RIGHT SORRY- OKAY I THAT MUST MISSED THAT OKAY AT NIGHT IN THEN AGAIN YEAH I YOU I THINK- THE IS NOT A- I. THAT EVERYTHING USED TO TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE SAY I'M JUST TO THINK OF WHAT WE DO. TO THIS I CAN TELL DISEASE RIGHT AND SO MOST OF THESE OPERATE ARE GOING TO. DISEASES AND- AS PEOPLE FROM ONE TO AND- AND I KNOW THAT YOUR MAIL IN CHARGE OF STUFF YOU KNOW THE WORK THAT THAT THE HAAS. PLACE THE ADAPTATION WHO ARE RESERVE THERE IN THEN YOU HAVE STAFF WHO WORKED- BUT THESE PEOPLE CREEK MOVED BACK IN FORTH- FOR. REASONS WE'VE GOT A TO GET THAT KIND OF. AS WELL AND AGAIN APPRECIATE EXAMPLE YOUR- AND MELENDEZ WHERE YOU YOU KNOW YOU YOU DO I. AND SO FORTH TO TRY SPUR FIFTY A PAGE CANCER IN OR OUT THAT'S THAT'S RAMPS APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE DONE- BUT I IS JUST. ONE TO GET A BETTER. OF HOW WERE. IN IN THE RESPONSE THE END THIS IS REALLY ABOUT. WHAT FOR THE- ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE DO WE HAVE THE DATA SAID. AND ARE WE HAVING TO. AND DATA COLLECTION PLACE BE ABLE TO. TRACK A OUTBREAK THAT. KILLED I CAN AGAIN. MOVE BETWEEN SETTING BECAUSE YOU GOT MOVING BETWEEN DIFFERENT SETTINGS AND THEY NEED TO CARRY AND IN FACT AS YOU MAY NOTE YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES YOU FOR FIVE. GRAYSON AND SO FORTH MAKES IT TO TRACK. AND THEN THE OTHER GET THE OTHER CAR. IS AND I KNOW THAT'S FOLLOW UP. A EGGMAN QUITE. IN TERMS OF. THE VACCINATION STAFF TO. A PERCENT THE PACE- HOPEFULLY WE GETTING. TO CAN. HAVE THE PAGE. AT 80% THE 60% RATES UNDER. WHEN YOU THAT- DOES BUT- YOU KNOW YOU FOR. DAY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TO- EARLY ADOPTER. IN ANY OF THE PEOPLE. I WANNA WAIT AND SEE AND SO FOR BUT- REACH TO GET LEE SOME IN FOR. FROM THIS. AT OF- IT'S IF THERE ARE. THAT WE CAN TRY TO DO TO HELP ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS THEY HAVE SO THAT- SO THAT THEY WOULD TOTALLY BE. MORE ACCEPTING OF- THE VACCINES ARE AT LEAST ADDRESSING ANY CONCERNS THEY HAVE AND IN SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF- OFFERING VACCINES TO. THE STAFF SO WE CAN ALSO GET THE RATE IN THE STAFF. ARE CLOSER TO THE 80% WE GOT TO THE PATIENTS. THOSE AT IT HAS BEEN SOME- WORK BEING DONE IN THAT AREA. IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT. THE STAFF. NEED TO KNOW OUR INFORMATION OR OTHER BARRIERS FOR THEM TO I GUESS ACTUALLY FOR THE REMAINING- A PORTION OF THE STAFF. BUT YEAH ACTUALLY I'M GONNA START THE WORKING MIKE ABOUT BECAUSE- WE HAVE AND- ENGAGING AND- I'M NOT. CONGRESS AND FIND UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO. AND AT. I HAVE TRYING DIFFERENT PROPER WITH YOU IT BROUGH OUTDOORS. SO AND WILL BRING YOU WANT AND- FOR THEIR MARKET. SURE AND WE DO IT IN OF. OUR REACHED WE DID. WE WEATHER AFFECTS ME WITH HER STAFF DO JUST A- SPECIFIC MEETINGS IN THEN WE DO A LARGE. NAY KIND OF WITH A OF OUR- TO WE TAKE. THAT THEY- AND THEY DETAIL QUITE. ABOUT VERY AND SO BOOST. AND SO WE GATHER ALL OF THAT IN. AND ALL OF THOSE. AND WE THAT AND- OUT WE HAVE PANELS ON OUR WEB AXES OF PEOPLE. WHO RECEIVED THE VACCINE YOU KNOW IF A QUESTION COMES UP. YOU KNOW I'VE TESTED. POSITIVE FOR COCAINE IN THE PAST SHOULD I GET A VACCINE LARGELY BRING IN A STAFF PERSON WHO'S- BEEN THROUGH THAT SITUATION TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT FELT LIKE. FOR THEM SO WE ARE VERY ENGAGED WITH OUR CLINICAL STAFF TRYING TO. GET THROUGH SOME OF THE BARRIERS RELATED TO VACCINE HESITANCY DUE TO- CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SAFETY OR EFFICACY OF THE OF THE VACCINE ITSELF. I'VE ALSO PARTICIPATED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE NATIONAL MEDICAL DIRECTORS COUNCIL AND WE HAD A BIG- TO THAT PART. OF THAT MEETING% ABOUT VACCINE HESITANCY WITH SOME- BEST PRACTICES SHARED- ONE OF THE BEST PRACTICES I LEARNED- FROM PARTICIPATING IN THAT. OUR GROUP IS A PROCESS WHEREBY WE NOW ARE SCHEDULING. ALL OF OUR STAFF WHO IS NOT YET. BEEN VACCINATED TO COME IN- EITHER TO- I GET THE VACCINE OR. TO ASSIGN A DECLINATION FORM SO THANK YOU US ENOUGH. TO THOSE FOLKS ARE. NOT COMING IN NOT OVER THE OF SCHEDULING POINT IF YOU. OKAY GIVE THE CITY TO HAVE A ON ONE HER GROUP HIM A- AND- THAT'S ACTUALLY REQUIRED BAD IT WHENEVER FACILITIES. THAT'S BEEN VERY SO WE'RE IN THE- OF NOW. OUT THROUGHOUT DIDN'T SEE AT THE- NINETEEN PER AMERICAN STAFF. BASICALLY SAID I'M NOT GOING ACCEPT VACCINE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES- BUT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THE THAT REST OF THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE. LATE ADOPTERS BUT NOT COMPLETELY AGAINST IT OKAY NOT THAT I APPRECIATE THAT AND CERTAINLY THAT SHOULD BE THE NEXT A- GROUP OF PEOPLE WORKING ON IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO FIND OUT WHAT. THE THAT REMAINING THE PRIORITY IS TO. YOU KNOW WHAT REASON AND- IT IS WE TRY TO DRESS A- THIS IS. THAT IS OFTEN ABOUT. SO I JUST YOU KNOW I DO WANT TO SERVE AND BY- RECOGNIZING THAT- USE THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN USE A DRESS A VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE YOU'RE RUNNING THESE. ESSENTIALLY CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES- AND AT PANDEMIC.

AND EVERITT SAID DR WARBURTON TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU AT WE ARE FORTUNATELY ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO BECAME A TRAUMA INFORMED SYSTEM WORKING WITH THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR TRAUMA INFORMED CARE SO TO SOME EXTENT HAD- ASSIMILATED PRINCIPLES THAT. ALLOWED US TO TAKE. GOOD CARE OF OUR STAFF THROUGH THIS CRISIS WE RECOGNIZED IN ABOUT THE THIRD WEEK OF MARCH THAT WE WERE. ENTERING INTO AND WOULD BE EXPERIENCING A SUSTAINED TRAUMA FOR AN UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME ONE OF THE TENETS OF BEING A TRAUMA INFORMED SYSTEM IS TRANSPARENCY COMMUNICATION- AND- THE ABILITY TO REALLY HEAR WHAT OUR STAFF HAD TO SAY- I'VE SO I'VE- EARLY DAYS MARCH WE STARTED IMPLEMENTING DAILY WEB AXES WE HAD DISCIPLINE SPECIFIC WEB ACCESS. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE BI DIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION WITH OUR STAFF WE DID THEM ACROSS ALL SHIFTS. INCLUDING ARE NOT SHIFT- WHERE WE WOULD PUSH OUT THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE BUT WE ALSO GATHERED INFORMATION SO WE DEVELOPED A PROCESS WHEREBY. ANY AND ALL STAFF QUESTIONS WERE COLLECTED DURING THOSE WEBACCESS WE WOULD BRING THOSE QUESTIONS TO THE EXACTLY. IF TEAM AN EXECUTIVE TEAM MADE A COMMITMENT. TO OUR STAFF TO HAVE ANSWERS BACK OUT- WITHIN I THINK FORTY EIGHT HOURS SO IF SOMEONE HAD A QUESTION ABOUT WHY THEY WERE GIVEN A SURGICAL MASK INSTEAD OF AN N. NINETY FIVE OR HOW TO CLEAN THAT OR- YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. ARE WE COULD PUSH OUT ANSWERS TO THEM IN REAL TIME AND ALSO HEAR THEIR SUGGESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND TRY TO INCORPORATE THAT SO I THINK THE PRINCIPLE OF TRANSPARENCY- THROUGH- VERY ACTIVE COMMUNICATION BI DIRECTIONALLY- IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT- ASPECTS OF WHAT WE DID. I WE HAD A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE CONSTANTLY COMING THE LITERATURE AND THE GUIDANCE TO MAKE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW OUR STAFF ARE SMART THEY'RE MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS SO WE DEVELOPED A WEBSITE- WITH ALL CURRENT INFORMATION SO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE COMPLEX OR SOPHISTICATED QUESTIONS WOULD HAVE.

OUT WHILE ALSO USING TELEHEALTH TO SUPPLEMENT SERVICE DELIVERY SO REALLY WHAT THIS FUNDS ARE FOR IS REALLY JUST TO SUPPORT THAT- INCREASING TRAVEL COSTS IN THE BETWEEN. THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. MISTER CAN YOU SEE WHERE THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA J. B. C. A. B. C. T. SITES. SURE YEAH- SO SHASTA. HUMBOLDT. WE ALSO DO HAVE A PROGRAM IN YEARS BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THE TRAVELING PSYCHOLOGISTS WILL SUPPORT THAT PROGRAM WE ALSO HAVE PROGRAMS IN MENDOCINO. AND- AS I MENTIONED ALSO CALAVERAS COUNTY.

THEM ABOUT ONE TIME SAVINGS FROM THE DELAYED ACTIVATION OF THE CURRENT EIGHT YES- FINANCIAL. SEVEN SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS REQUEST IS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND TO SUPPORT- CONTRACTED PATIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCACY SERVICE SENSE- WHICH IS SORT OF THE STANDARD ADJUSTMENT THAT WOULD INCLUDE WITH ALL ARGUED REQUESTED PROGRAMS. THE END OF MY PRESENTATION ON THE CASE. CAN YOU ED ARE IS THAT THERE'S A STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGY OF CARE AT EACH OF THESE SITES AND IS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU WERE DOING. IN THE FACILITIES BEFORE YOU TOOK THEM OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE GBC YES YES FOR ME THE CONDITIONAL RELEASE. C. T. SITES- WELL WRITTEN WITH RESPECT TO THE TREATMENT THE TREATMENT IS VERY CONSISTENT TO WHAT IS OFFERED- IN THE STATE HOSPITALS BECAUSE IT IS IN A LOCKED CAN CHANGE ENVIRONMENT AND SO- THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE STAFFED WITH PSYCHOLOGISTS- PRIMARILY AS WELL AS SOCIAL WORK- TO DELIVER GROUP FACE TREATMENT AND EVALUATION SERVICES BUT I GUESS WITH RESPECT TO CO BAD ON THERE THERE DEFINITELY WERE SOME OPERATIONAL CHANGES MADE- PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCING GROUP SIZE OR IN SOME CASES- ELIMINATING GROUP AND GOING MORE TO A ONE TO ONE- INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PROGRAM. I THINK DUE TO THE SIZE AND- SORT OF SCOPE OF MOST OF THE PROGRAMS MAJORITY OF THE PROGRAM'S NOW HOW ARE FIVE FIVE TO TEN DAY PROGRAMS IT'S EASIER TO DELIVER THE INDIVIDUAL BASED TREATMENT- BUT AS A AS- SORT OF THE RISK OF CODE VEIN- AND AS FOLKS HAVE BEEN GETTING- VACCINATED THOSE GROUPS- HAVE DEFINITELY OPENED BACK UP AT ARMS ON MORE OF THE SMALLER SCALE OKAY AND HAVE YOU SEEN ISSUES- OR DO YOU ANTICIPATE ISSUES WITH RECRUITMENT AND STAFFING AS AS WE'VE SEEN AN EDUCATIONAL OF TEACHER JUST RETIRING I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF. STAFF WHO WERE YOU KNOW NEARING RETIREMENT AGE OF JUST GONNA HAD RETIRED AND THEN. DO YOU ANTICIPATE THERE'S GOING TO BE. ALBUM WITH RECRUITMENT RETENTION GOING. WELL THESE THESE ARE ARE- ARE DEPARTMENTS CONTRA PROBE- WE DO THE WAY THESE ARE WE DIRECTLY WITH THE SHERIFF AND THE SHERIFF AND SUBCONTRACTS WITH MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND- BY AND LARGE- IT IS PARTICULARLY IN URBAN AREAS WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH- RECRUITMENT. CERTAINLY WE HAVE SEEN NOT IN OUR MORE AS THEY DESCRIBED AND MORE RURAL AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES WHICH IS WHY WE WERE TRYING TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND- GO WITH- MORE ABOUT MOBILE- MODEL OF CARE AS WELL AS- SUPPLEMENTING WITH WHICH AND TELEHEALTH- AND SO I THINK. BY HAVING THOSE RESOURCES IT'LL DEFINITELY HELP TO OPEN UP THERE THE DOOR- TO EASE WITH THAT RECRUITING CHALLENGES BUT IN TERMS OF LIKE RETIREMENTS I DON'T FORESEE IT BEING ANY MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT HAS BEEN- IN-THE RECENT YEARS BUT WE'RE PRETTY STRATEGIC ABOUT- ARE PLANNING WHEN WE DO OPEN UP THE STREET THE CITY PROGRAM'S REALLY WORKING WITH THE SHERIFF'S AND TRYING TO TIME- TRYING TO TIME THE OPENING THE PROGRAMS TO WIN RECRUITMENT AND SUCCESSFUL CRITIC IS TAKING PLACE. SO PRETTY MINDFUL- STATS. OKAY AND IN ANYTHING ADD ON THAT JUST IN THE LARGER SYSTEM CONCERNS ABOUT STAFFING RECRUITING GOING FORWARD STAFF HEALTH. BUT YOU KNOW THE AS A DEPARTMENT WE HAVE A WHOLE BIT DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OR POSSIBLY HM WE DEFINITELY HAVE SOME CLASSIFICATIONS THAT ALREADY WORDS PARENTING CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF BAD. ARE WITH RESPECT TO RECRUITMENT SO IT'S ALWAYS AN ONGOING EFFORT IN WORK I TEACH RIGHTS WHO REALLY RECRUITS- E.ON RETAIN THE STOP THAT WE HAVE THAT'S WHY WE ALSO ARE WORKING HERE KIND OF- SOME OF THE THINGS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO STOP HIS ARMS. HAS LIKE IT RESIDENCY PROGRAM AND TO INCREASE WORK WITH THE- WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS TO KIND OF INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE TRAINING FOR AN APARTMENT SESSIONS BECAUSE WHEN YOU GROW ON YOUR OWN AND YOU DON'T AND YOU TRAIN THEM WITHIN YOUR SYSTEM OFTEN THEY STAY WITHIN THEIR SYSTEM SO THAT'S WHY. WE STARTED WORKING. ON SOME OF THE STRATEGIES AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU ANYTHING FROM THE PARK FINANCE. HELLO OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- WE DID GET EVERY DETAIL RIGHT UP AS WELL- IN OUR PACKETS SO- I GUESS BUT THE LARGER QUESTION IS- SO GIVEN CASELOAD SO ALL THE DIFFERENT CHANGES YOU YOU'VE YOU'VE PATIENTLY HERE EXPLAINED TO US- WHAT IS THE NET CHANGE IN THE BUDGET REQUEST AS A RESULT OF THE- CASELOAD UPDATES.

OF SELLING ICE TEAS IN THE STATE. MANY OF OUR EXISTING COUNTY PROGRAMS THAT WE WORK WITH I HAVE EXPRESSED INTERESTING IN EXPANDING THEIR PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO NEW CLIENTS. AND WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT MANY COUNTIES NOT CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THE TSCH PRIOR AND HAD DEVELOPED MISDEMEANOR I ISSUED A VERSION PROGRAMS AND PROTOCOLS THAT COULD BE EXPANDED.

YOU'RE CERTAINLY COLLECTING- DATA FROM OUR COUNTIES NOT ONLY JUST THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND- SERVICE DELIVERY DATA THAT'S REQUIRED BY STATUTE BUT WE ARE ALSO COLLECTING- FINANCIAL DATA. THAT'S MORE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SO THAT WE CAN ONE COMPARE IT TO THE ORIGINAL PLANS THAT THE COUNTIES WERE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO US- AND THEN ALSO TO EVALUATE- IF THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING LEVERAGED- TO DRIVE DOWN SAY ADDITIONAL MEDIC HOW DOLLARS IF THERE'S USES AN HSA DOLLARS. WHAT WE- DO YOU KNOW SO I GUESS TO ANSWER YOUR YOUR QUESTION WE WILL HAVE SOME INFORMATION IN TERMS- COSTS- AND CAN COMPARE THAT TO SAY THE COST OF CARE IN THE STATE HOSPITAL- AND THEN- YOU CAN ALSO COMPARE IT TO- THE. COST OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT. NUMBER EIGHTY CENTS SO I THINK WHAT WE LOOKING SOME OF THE ARE TALK ABOUT IS. THE REASON WAS JUST TO TRY TO MOVE- NOT HAVE PATIENCE END UP IN STATE HOSPITALS ARE ARE HAVING A BACKLOG AT CETERA SELF. I HOPE THAT- YOU KNOW THE FUTURE PRESENTATIONS AND I REALIZE THAT THIS YEAR ALSO THERE ARE STILL DELAYS HAPPEN BECAUSE A COVETED CETERA. BUT I THINK IT. IT IN PRESENTATIONS EACH YEAR AND- IN THE FUTURE THAT WE WOULD HAVE A- AND- AS TO YOU KNOW HOW THIS INVESTMENT IS ACTUALLY HELP TO REDUCE- BACKLOGS AND- CASELOADS. IN IT AND- IT TO THE STATE HOSPITALS AND SO FORTH TWENTY I FOR THIS GROUP OF. PATIENTS AND- THAT THEY'RE GETTING ABLE TO GET CARE MORE UP IN THE GROUND- AND- COUNTY SO- SO I JUST HOPE THAT- WE CAN HAVE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION AS THIS PROGRAM IS ROLLING OUT AND NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE END OF A FIVE YEAR EVALUATION. BEFORE WE HAVE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WILL WILL NOTE THAT GOING FORWARD. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN. SHE NUMBER SIX THE COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAM EXPANSION. AGAIN PRESIDENT'S DEPUTY DIRECTOR FORENSIC SERVICES WELCOME BACK HI. THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO EXPAND OUR EXISTING CD OPPORTUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAM IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY I IN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED BEDS- TO SERVICE S. T. POPULATION. IN ADDITION THIS FUNDING REQUEST PROVIDES TIME LIMITED TRANSITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT WHAT WE CALL THE OFFERING. M. I. S. T. DEFENDANTS ARE TO THE COMMUNITY WHO MAKE ART RESTORED TO COMPETENCY WHILE THEY'RE STILL WAITING IN JAIL- AND THEN WE ASSUME A PHASED APPROACH FOR THE ACTIVATION OF THESE NEW BEDS OVER A FORTY FIVE MONTH PERIOD- I WILL SAY THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS- IN THIS IN THIS PROPOSAL DID ASSUME H. I BELIEVE FEBRUARY- ACTIVATION WE ARE SLIGHTLY DELAYED- BUT ARE. INTOXICATING IN THIS NEXT MONTH ACTIVATION ACTIVATE- IN ADDITION WE ARE REQUESTING FOR A HALF MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND FIVE MILLION I'M GOING TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM BY AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY BAD. TO OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE- UP WITH AND THEN YOU COUNTIES THAT WERE ENGAGING THIS YEAR UP TO TWENTY BEDS WILL ACTIVATE BY JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR WITH THE REMAINING THIRTY PARENTS. ARE TO BE ACTIVATED BY OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF THESE PROGRAMS WERE ALSO REQUESTING ONE POSITION WHO- WILL SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION AND ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS THE EXISTING LA CPR PROGRAM WHICH WE DID NOT REQUEST STAFF RESOURCES TO- IN ADDITION THIS REQUEST WOULD SUPPORT- AN INCREASE IN TRAVEL COSTS FOR A POSITION TO SUPPORT OUTREACH PROGRAM PLANNING PROGRAM ACTIVATION AS WELL AS PROGRAM EVALUATION. LASTLY WE- THIS REQUEST INCLUDES SOME CONTRACT DOLLARS TO SUPPORT- TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE FUNDING ASSUMPTIONS FOR- OUR OUR EXPANSION OF THE BADS ARE REALLY- BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE AN ACTUAL COSTS- FROM OUR LOS ANGELES COUNTY PROGRAM. AND AS WELL AS AS EXPERIENCED IN OPERATING- AND WHAT WE KNOW FROM OUR ACTIVATED- FELONY MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAMS. I WOULD NOTE ON THE NAVIGATIONAL RESOURCES FORD ON THE COUNTIES IN THIS REQUEST- MAYBE ADD- IF THE COMMUNITY CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT PROPOSAL WHICH I WILL NOT TALK ABOUT LATER IN THIS PRESENTATION WAS NOT APPROVED. SO IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR DIVERSION PROGRAM AS WELL AS OUR G. C. T. PROGRAMS THE INITIATIVE WILL EXPAND THE CAPACITY TO TREAT I ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITY I REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS PENDING PLACEMENT TO DS EACH FACILITIES. AND WILL SUPPORT THE OVERALL ROSE- AND GOLDUST REDUCING EMISSION TIMES FOR TREATMENT. IN MY PRESENTATION ANY QUESTIONS. A DEPARTMENT FINANCE. HELLO. NO I THINK WE'RE I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT ISSUE MEDIA HERE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR TWENTY HIGHEST TEEN I'M JOINED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT STEPHANIE. WHO WILL COME BACK OKAY. MY GOD HELP ME AGAIN CAN YOU HEAR ME YOUR- ALL RIGHT THANK YOUNG AND JUST I WOULD BE FORCED ON THEM I DO WANT TO RESPOND TO DR PEONS A QUESTION EARLIER THIS CASE THAT DATES WERE ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION IN TOTAL. THANK YOU FOR THAT PARTICULAR. I'M ON. IT SOBRE ISSUE SEVEN OF THE COMMUNITY CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR FELONY I. S. TEENS THE DEPARTMENT HAS CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE A WAIT LIST FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. AND HER PENDING ADMISSION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASING REFERRALS THE DEPARTMENT ACTIVATED ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IN ITS STATE HOSPITALS. WE HEARD I MISS EVEN TALK ABOUT THE DIVERSION PROGRAM WE ARE WORKING TO ESTABLISH WE PARTNERED WITH A COUNTY SHERIFF'S TO STOMP THE JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND CONTRACTED AS WE JUST HEARD WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO. PROVIDE COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAMS. EACH OF THESE EFFORTS HAS BEEN IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE INCREASING REFERRALS TO THE DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER DESPITE ALL OF OUR EFFORTS THE REFERRALS CONTINUE TO GROW AND EXCEED CAPACITY- PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL THAT WERE PENDING PLACEMENT TO AND STATE HOSPITAL BED- HOVERED AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED. WE WERE SEEING THAT NUMBER I'D BE DECREASE AND WE HAD ADDITIONAL- ACTIONS THAT WE HAD PLANNED- THAT WE WERE EXACERBATED THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO DECREASE. BUT SINCE THE PANDEMIC I'M DUE TO ALL OF THE- IMPACTS OR OPERATIONS INTO THE OPERATIONS OF OTHERS THAT WE PARTNER WITH. I WE'VE SEEN THIS NUMBER GROW SIGNIFICANTLY- TODAY THE WAIT LIST IS NEARLY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PATIENTS. AS A RESULT OF THIS WEIGHTLESS THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE INCREASING COURT PRESSURE ONTO TIMELY ADMIT IT THE I. A. C. DEFENDANTS FOR TREATMENT. OVER THE YEARS AND HOUSE CONDUCT AND ALSO OF THE I. POCKET TREE AND THAT'S- IN THROUGH THIS AND- WE FOUND THE MID. OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE OMITTED AS I S. T. HAVE NOT RECEIVED SUFFICIENT MENTAL HEALTH CARE PRIOR TO THEIR ADMISSION. AND ARE CYCLING IN AND OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. APPROXIMATELY 50% HAD NOT ACCESS COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT RESOURCES AND THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR ARREST. 45% HAD FIFTEEN OR MORE PRIOR ARREST BEFORE BEING COMMITTED TO D. S. H. ON THEIR FELONY CHARGE AND ADDITIONALLY NEARLY ONE HALF WERE UNSHELTERED HOMELESS AT THE TIME OF THE REST. SO THIS YEAR THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING TO ESTABLISH THE COMMUNITY CARE COLLABORATIVE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT OR INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AND WE'RE REQUESTING TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION IN GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND FOUR POSITIONS. AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION ONGOING FOR THIS EFFORT. AND UNDER THIS DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WE WOULD CONTRACT WITH COUNTIES TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CARE AND TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN FOUND I S. T. ON FELONY CHARGES FROM THEIR COUNTY. THROUGH THIS DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WE SEEK TO PROMOTE A COMMUNITY BASED CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR FELONY I IS T. DEPENDENCE. IN THE STATE BACK TO SUPPORT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION FOR DEFENDANTS WHO CAN BE BEST CARED FOR IN LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS IN THE COMMUNITY WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME DEFENDANTS WITH CERTAIN VIOLENT CHARGES THAT MAY NEED TO BE TREATED AND SECURED FACILITIES INCLUDING JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAMS. OR STATE HOSPITALS. I WE ALSO SEEK TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS WITH STREAMLINED RESPONSIBILITY AND THE LINE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AT THE COUNTY LEVELS FOR THIS POPULATION TO DRIVE IMPROVED OUTCOMES. SUCH AS REDUCED INCARCERATION AND RECIDIVISM. AND HOMELESSNESS FOR THIS POPULATION. WE ALSO I WANT TO PROMOTE INCREASED. WITHIN THEIR EXIST COUNTY FUNDING STREAMS TO LAMINATE SILENT APPROACHES TO THE DELIVERY OF TREATMENT FOR SERVICES FOR. INDEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS NOT COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. AND PROVIDE TIMELY RESTORATION OF COMPETENCY FOR AYE IS DEPENDENT STATEWIDE AND BETTER OVERALL OUTCOMES FOR DEPENDENTS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WERE JUSTICE INVOLVED. IN THIS ALSO THIS PROPOSAL WHAT WE ALSO SEEK TO REDUCE OUR RISK- FOR LEGAL FINES AND CONTEMPT FINDINGS BY THE COURTS. SO I'M GONNA ACTUALLY TURNED THIS OVER AGAIN AND TO DEBBIE DIRECTOR EVENINGS WHO'S GOING TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THE- PROPOSAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU THIS PROPOSAL- OUR ASSUMPTIONS DO YOU- DO YOU ASSUME THAT TRANSITION COULD OCCUR AS SOON AS JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HE FEATURES OF THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE. ONE ONGOING FUNDING AS SO TO LIMIT THE RISK OF BUILDING OUT NEW PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY Q. ONE TIME FUNDS TO SUPPORT PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS BY PARTICIPATING COUNTIES AND READ WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT THAT WE THAT WILL BE PROVIDED BY. WILL BE A STAGE AS WELL AS CONTRACTED EXPERTS- SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE IS THAT A HOLISTIC FUNDING PACKAGE THAT PROVIDES- THE FUNDING FOR THE TREATMENT SERVICES HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES- REALLY CHÃ¡VEZ ME OUT BEST NEED NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION- WHICH REALLY OFTEN REPRESENT OUR HIGHEST WEISS'S. IN THE SYSTEM. THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT PROPOSES AS A MENTION ON GOING BASELINE FUNDING FOR PARTICIPATING COUNTIES WITH SOME OF THOSE ONE TIME THAT INVESTMENTS THE BASELINE FUNDING. IS BASED ON A FIXED RATE WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO THE COST OF TREATING AND I. S. T. PATIENT IN THE STATE HOSPITAL THAT. ANNUAL FUNDING WOULD BE BASED ON THIS FIXED RATE. AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF I. S. T. IS ESTIMATED TO BE COMMITTED BY THE OUNTY- AND THAT ESTIMATE IS REALLY BASED ON AN AVERAGE AND PRIOR THREE YEARS AN ACTUAL I. S. T. COMMITMENTS REFERRED TO D. S. H. AT THIS TIME THAT- HOSPITAL DUTY DEATH RATE IS. IS SIX NINETY NINE- AND BASED ON OUR LENGTH OF STAY B. FIXED RATE IS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND THREE FORTY FIVE. IN ADDITION TO ONGOING FUNDS UP TO THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN ONE TIME PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION FUNDS- WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE WHICH CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT ALL STARTED COSTS INCLUDING RECRUITMENT HIRING TRAINING OF NEW STAFF. AS WELL AS THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. ON THE FIRST YEAR WOULD ALSO INCLUDE ONE TIME FINDING- CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT FORTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS ON THE DS EACH WEEK REST AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. RIGHT NOT YET ADMITTED TO A D. S. EACH PROGRAM. THAT ESTIMATE IS BASED ON- AN ESTIMATED FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILES. IN ADDITION WE WOULD PROPOSE TO TRANSFER ANY FINDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED TO COUNTIES- BROUGH THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED TO COUNTY SIR OTHER CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE I HAD MENTIONED AND I JUST TALKED ABOUT OUR DIVERSION PROGRAMS IF ONE OF OUR PARTICIPATING COUNTIES UNDER DISCUSSION. DEMONSTRATION PROJECT IS CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN OUR DIVERSION PILOT PROGRAM- WHILE NOTHING WILL CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENT OF THAT PROGRAM- WE WOULD PROPOSE TO JUST SHIFT OVER THE BALANCE AND EVERYTHING- TOOK THAT COUNTY UNDER THAT CONTRACT BUT FOLDED UNDER ONE SORT OF SINGULAR CONTRACT. AS PART OF THE CCD. AND SO THEN AGAIN AS PART OF THIS PROJECT WE ARE PROPOSING AN INITIAL THREE YEAR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS- THAT WOULD RUN THROUGH FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT COMMUNITY TREATMENT PROGRAM PLANS. AND EXPENDITURE REPORTS ANNUALLY AND ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT DEMOGRAPHIC IN TREATMENT DATA AGAIN VERY CONSISTENT WITH OUR DIVERSION PROGRAM- OUR EVALUATION OF WILL REALLY AS- STEPHANIE MENTIONED THAT- EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF. STREAMLINING THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO DRIVE IMPROVED OUTCOMES- AS WELL AS EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY APPLIED TO REASSESS THE BASELINE FUNDING ALLOCATED TO EACH COUNTY. AS WELL AS CONSIDER ANY CHANGES TO THE OVERALL GROWTH IN THE COUNTY POPULATION OR COST OF CARE FACTORS THAT MIGHT TRADE INCREASES OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN'S CONTROL. I THINK I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT COUNTIES WERE TALKING WITH DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE EVERY LEVEL OF CARE THAT'S READILY AVAILABLE IN TIME FOR A JULY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE ACTIVATION- BUT SO WITH THAT WE FULLY EXPECT THAT THE CONTINUUM SERVICES UTILIZED IN THE FIRST AND SECOND YEAR OF THE PROGRAM MAY LOOK VERY DIFFERENT AND IT WILL BE IN FUTURE YEARS PARTICULARLY AS OTHER- ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUAL ARE MADE. IN YOUR ARMS. I SO WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED IN THE AGENDA- THE FIRST QUESTION HOW WITH THIS PROGRAM INTERACT WITH THE PREVIOUS HIGHEST YOU DIVERSION PROGRAM AND THE LA. COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAM THAT WAS AUTHORIZED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- I THINK I NOTED EARLIER ANY OTHER CONTRACTED DS EACH PROGRAM- THAT PARTICIPATING COUNTY AS AN- OLD WEST- WOULD BECOME PART AT THE OVER ALL CCG- FOR EXAMPLE. ME HAS A DIVERSE CONTRA- THEN WE TRANSFER ALL OF THOSE REMAINING BALANCES FUNDS SIMILARLY IF THEY COUNTY- HAS A COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAM OR JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT WE WOULD TRANSFER THOSE PROGRAMS. SHOULD BE COUNTY RESPONSIBILITY. THE SECOND QUESTION HOUSE YEARS EACH BOARD MEETING WITH OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS AND ENTITIES INCLUDING MAC HOW AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AS WELL AS HOW TO BE ABLE HEALTH PROGRAMS TO COORDINATE OTHER STATE. AND LOCAL. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION- WELL WE'VE MET- ACTUALLY MULTIPLE TIMES WITH OUR- SISTER DEPARTMENTS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS WELL AS COMPARTMENT AND SOCIAL SERVICES. TO DISCUSS- THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN THERE BY CHANCE IN THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE REALLY BEING MADE- BY THE THEY- BE ADMINISTRATION IN THE COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPACE- AND SO WHILE OUR PROPOSAL- THE CCG. AND THE OTHER. PROPOSED ARE ON SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TIMELINES I WOULD NOTE THAT OUR- ARE PROPOSAL REALLY OFFICE FINDING. OFFER A VERY SPECIFIC POPULATION THAT WILL NECESSARILY BE THE SERVICE BY THE OTHER PROPOSALS- BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY OR NEEDING- SO THAT- WE ARE AVOIDING- WHERE WE CAN'T ANY DUPLICATION OF EFFORTS- AND THEN SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE'VE MATT WITH MULTIPLE COUNTIES- CONSIDERING PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROGRAM. WE'VE ALSO MET WITH VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS TO DATE THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES- USING CITIES HAVE PROVIDED US WITH SOME FEEDBACK ON THE CREDIT FILE PROJECT AND WE'RE TAKING THAT FEEDBACK INTO CONSIDERATION. FOR THE ME REVISED- AND- WE WILL ALSO AS PART OF MAY REVISE ANNOUNCE ANY COUNTIES THAT HAVE AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THISPROGRAM- AS PART OF THAT PROCESS. AND THEN WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE PROCESS OF REACHING OUT OR NEEDING MEETINGS WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO DISCUSS THIS PROPOSAL- SO FOR EXAMPLE- THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION JUDICIAL COUNCIL- AS THERE IS SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS PROPOSAL THAT. REALLY OFF AUTHORIZES THE PROGRAM AND ALSO PROPOSES SOME CHANGES TO THE PENAL CODE THIRTEEN SEVENTY TWO CREATED PATHWAY FOR THE COURTS TO REFERRED TO FELLAINI ICE YOU POPULATION TO THE PARTICIPATING COUNTIES. RATHER THAN DIRECTLY. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS- QUESTION I'M THREE DESCRIBE HOW THE INCENTIVES FOR COUNTIES WOULD WORK TO PROMOTE INTERVENTIONS PRIOR TO FELONY I JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT- WELL THIS PROGRAM REALLY DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY THAN OUR- PROPOSAL THAT WE HAD PUT FORTH IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROCESS. AND THAT WAS CALLED THE COMMUNITY CARE COLLABORATIVE HI LINDA CCC HE- VERY SIMILAR- WHILE THE MAIN GOAL AND THE CCCP WAS INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO CREATE UPSTREAM INTERVENTIONS. FELONY JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS CURRENT PROJECT IS REALLY TO GIVE COUNCILS ALL THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO SUPPORT A FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE IN THE COMMUNITY- AND- APPROPRIATE TREATMENT FOR THAT SELLING Y. S. T. POPULATION. ON THE FAT FUNDING METHODOLOGY FOR THIS PROGRAM USES AN AVERAGE COST OF CARE I S. T. IN A STATE HOSPITAL- WHICH WE FEEL IS HIGHER THAN THE COST OF WHAT THE CARE WOULD BEIN LOWER LEVELS OF CARE. IN THAT ENGINE UNITY AS WELL AS THE COST OF THE GOP'S COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAM. AND SO WHILE CHINESE WILL STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE HIGHER COSTS BADS- AT THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS IF THE RESOURCES ARE MANAGED RIGHT AND WE HAVE- ALSO CONTINUAL OF THE LOWER LEVEL- THIS RESTRICTED BAD. SMALLER COST FADS- THE COUNTY'S CALL. RELY SAVINGS EACH YEAR- US THROUGH THIS PER- HOWEVER CV WE PROPOSE ANY- WE WOULD. A WITH THE COW TO BE REINVESTED IN THOSE UPSTREAM OR DOWNSTREAM ON SUCH AS RE ENTRY PROGRAMS TO PREVENT FELONY JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS- AND SO. THIS IN TURN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS THAT CAN BE INVESTED BECAUSE WE CAN BE YOUR DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WILL GUARANTEE COUNTY AS A MINIMUM LEVEL OF FUNDING REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF ACTUAL SELLING UNITS TO BE SERVED IN HERE. AND SO THE COUNTY IS ABLE TO REDUCE AS WELL THE NUMBER OF I. S. G. COMMITMENTS EACH YEAR THERE FUNDING THROUGH THE S. H. WOULD REMAIN THE SAME AND ADDITIONAL FUNDS CAN THEN BE APPLIED TO THOSE UPSTREAM AND- DOWNSTREAM PROGRAMS. ANY QUESTIONS- THE FIRST THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. LMAO END UP THERE MR SHOULD. THANK YOU AND CENTER EGGMAN ACCORDING WITH THE L. A. O. OUR OFFICE IS RECENTLY PUBLISHED AN ANALYSIS OF THIS PROPOSAL WHICH IS AVAILABLE ON OUR ON OUR WEBSITE- WORK WE'RE ACTUALLY RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL WHILE WE DON'T HAVE ISSUES WITH THE CONCEPT OF MAKING COUNTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR TREATING FELONY ICE TEAS- WE FIND THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT WELL STRUCTURED TO ACHIEVE ITS INTENDED GOALS- FOR EXAMPLE THE CCP'S FUNDING MECHANISM. MAKES WHETHER COUNTIES WILL HAVE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES. FOR THE POINT THAT THEY COMMIT AN OFFENCE YOU KNOW SORT OF THOSE UPSTREAM SERVICES THAT WORD THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED- SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY IN ADDITION WE FIND THAT THE INCENTIVES FOR COUNTIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROJECT ARE ARE UNCLEAR AND- THE PROPOSAL ALSO PROVIDES ON GOING FUNDING TO- A PROJECT PRIOR TO THE POINT WHEN AN EVALUATION CAN BE DONE ON ITS EFFECTIVENESS- THIS EASY PEASY. ALSO OVERLAP WITH SEVERAL EXISTING PROGRAMS IN D. S. H. THROUGH WHICH COUNTIES PROVIDE TREATMENT TO FELONY ICE TEAS- WE FIND THIS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VALUE ADD OF THIS- PROPOSAL WHEN COMPARED TO. YOU KNOW EXISTING PROGRAMS HAVE ALREADY BEEN FUNDED IN PRIOR YEARS- GIVEN THESE CONCERNS WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REJECT THIS PROPOSAL- SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE WISH TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING TO COUNTIES FOR COMPETENCY RESTORATION TREATMENT- WE WOULD RECOMMEND DIRECTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO- EXISTING PSH PROGRAMMES FOR THAT PURPOSE- IN REGARDS TO PROVIDING INDIVIDUALS- PROVIDING TREATMENT INDIVIDUALS ON THE FRONT END BEFORE THEY COMMIT OFFENSES THAT COULD. RENDER THEM I A CD- WE FIND THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET THAT MAKES SORT OF MORE DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES THAT. WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE AT REACHING SORT OF THIS THIS- POPULATION IS SORT OF AT PARTICULAR RISK OF BEING FOUND I. S. T. FOR EXAMPLE THE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL IN DH CS FOR BEAVER HEALTH FACILITIES- OR THE PROPOSED ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFITING MANY CALENDAR CALLIE- WHICH WOULD BE TARGETED AT JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS- SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE WISH TO MAKE THIS A PRIORITY. YOU KNOW WE FIND AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY COULD BE TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR D. S. H. TO WORK WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO BUILD. REALLY SORT OF I. S. T. SPECIFIC ISSUES INTO- SORT OF. THESE THESE OTHER PROPOSALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT'S ALONG LINES MEANS. YOU HAVE THE OF THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING THAT. WE'VE ALREADY HEARD SOME OF THE OTHER PROPOSALS FROM SOME OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS- IT'S GONNA BE. THERE THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WERE ALL LOOKING AT AND CALLING THAT WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT. AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND YOUR- YOU KNOW AND I THINK YOU'VE BEEN PUSHED TO TRY TO- IDENTIFY THESE FOLKS BEFORE. THEY'VE YOU KNOW THEY'VE COME TO THE ATTENTION FIFTEEN TIMES BEFORE YOU GET THEM. YOU KNOW AND I AND I GUESS I JUST JUST SITTING HERE AT WITH. THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE WERE GRAPPLING WITH- BUT WE'RE ALL GRAPPLING WITH THAT. W. E. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE THE FLOOD OR THE DAM BUT YEAR WHERE THINGS GET BACKED UP WHEN WE DON'T DO ALL OF OUR WORK ON THE FRONT END OUT IN THE COMMUNITY- SO I GUESS AND- I GUESS I. BUT WE UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR DESIRE AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. TO SERVICE POPULATION AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WITH THE HUGE BACKLOG. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER PROPOSALS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ON THE TABLE. TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES. I'M THE ONE RESPOND A LITTLE BIT TO THE L. A. O. OR- OR NOT AT THIS TIME. EITHER ENOUGH EITHER FOR THAT THE DIRECTOR OF THE FOR THE DEPUTY. I'LL START AND THEN. PASS IT OVER TO PRESS IF SHE HAS ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD JUST NOTE IN THE- RECOMMENDATION TO INVEST FURTHER IN THE STRATEGIES- AND WE DO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN STRATEGY. ALL OF THE STRATEGIES AROUND- I. S. TEASE AND IT WE DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE ON DIVERSION AS WELL AS FOR- A COMMUNITY BASED ON GBC T. IS THAT WE WHAT WE'RE WE'RE FINDING IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNTY IS THAT THOSE THAT HAVE. BUILT SOME OF THIS CONTINUUM ALREADY AND I'VE ALREADY BEEN OUR PARTNERS ARE ARE PROBABLY THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE BEST SUITED FOR MOVING INTO TAKING OVER RESPONSIBILITY THEY. HAVE EXPERIENCE READING THEM AND- BUT FAR AS JUST. TWENTY IN THE THESE STRATEGIES- WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS. WE HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE COMMITTEES ARE BUDGET COMMITTEES AND YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR ASKING FOR IN COMPANIES AND PROPERTY AND BUILDING CAPACITY TO SERVE IT WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. I'M EIGHT THROUGH THESE PARTNERSHIPS. BUT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THE RATES OF REFERRALS CONTINUE. TO INCREASE- YEAH THIS YEAR IS AS- INCREASES MARGINALLY MOSTLY AND SAY IT'S ALL COKE RIGHT. BUT IN THE PRIOR YEARS AS WE DEVELOP OUR CAPACITY WE SIGN THE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND SO I AM MOVING THAT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COUNTY. WHAT THAT DOES IS GIVES ME COUNTY BACK MY FULL CONTROL THE THAT THE UNDERSTANDING THE ABILITY TO THE KIND OF ALL THE PARTNERS WORKING TOGETHER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. WHERE THE CHALLENGES ARE IN THE IN IN THEIR THEIR CONTINUUM OF CARE EONS- WHAT INVESTMENT STRATEGIES THEY NEED TO DO TO TARGET THIS POPULATION- WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT. YOU REALLY WHAT WE SEE IS THAT OFTEN THE ABILITY TO PUT SOMEBODY OUT OF STATE HOSPITAL IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TREATMENT. AND IN MANY CASES AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO TRY TO AS DRESSED IN THIS MYSTERY POPULATION THAT WE AS THE DEPARTMENT APPLE RESPONSIBILITY THE STATE OWNS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYBODY WHO'S FOUND ANTHONY HOPKINS FAN FROM. IS TO MOVE INTO AS THAT THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTY SO THAT THEY ARE HAVING. A ROLE IN ON AND HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO- A SERVICE FASCICULATION INTO. WAY IN PARTNERSHIP IN COLLABORATION WITH ALL THE OTHER EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING IN INVESTMENTS ARE BEING MADE RAN. INTO ARE INTENT. AND SO I'LL ASK AND DENTAL DOCTOR EVEN IF SHE HAS ANY AN ADDITIONAL. COMMENT SHE WANTS ME. HERE YEAH I WOULD- WELL OF THAT IS RIGHT WE ARE ARE EX WITH DAVE AND- CDS THREE. WELL I'LL SET CBO SITE YOU MEAN A DIAPER AND WE HAVE- THAT. SHIPS WITH THE COUNTY IS THAT THERE A STRONG. TO LEARN MORE ABOUT SORT OF THE BEST PRACTICES AND TECHNIQUE THAT WILL BE SERVE A SORT OF CRIME. WE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE TALKING AND THAT'S THAT. THAT WE BRING TO TABLE- I DO I DO WITH. THAT IS MORE MORE PARTICULARLY AROUND- THE WHOLE SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DESIGNED TO- TO- TAKE- WHATEVER IT TAKES APPROACH AND SERVE THAT THAT WILL JUST JUST POPULATION BUT THERE ARE SOME SOME UNIQUE NEEDS ARM OF. THE FELONY I S. T. POPULATION- NOT SO UNIQUE THAT THE COUNTIES ARE INADEQUATE TO HANDLE- OR TAKE CARE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS BUT I THINK WHAT WHAT WE BRING. WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS. AS I SAID IT'S BOTH HAVE HOW. TREAT SERVICES. FOR ALL DHABI. AS WELL AS FORCE TO REALLY- PROVIDED A SUPPORTIVE APPROACH IN THE COUNTIES IN- GIVING THEM BEAT YOU KNOW TA IN THE TRAINING RESOURCES AND GET TO- SUPPORT THEIR STAFF IN THE- IN THE COMMUNITY AS THEIR AS THEIR TEACHINGS OF. HE'S A MAJOR. AND- I GUESS I WOULD ALSO SAY IN TERMS OF JUST THE DUPLICATION WE DON'T THERE IS NO DUPLICATION OF SERVICES IN TERMS OF GB CG AND COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION- ARE WE HAVE BEEN VERY STRATEGIC ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE NEED TO- REALLY BE VERY RESPONSIVE TO YOU OUR WAIT LIST AND GROWING WEIGHT LISTS- AND WE NEED. THE BIG BOLD- PROPOSALS TO- TO TACKLE THIS FROM EVERY ANGLE I GUESS IF YOU WILL. AND SO WITH THAT COMMUNITY CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT ON AS I MENTIONED IF THERE ARE ANY EXISTING CONTRACTS THAT SUCH AS A JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAM OR COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION PROGRAM. THAT ALL THOSE RESOURCES AND THOSE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO NOT PARTICIPATING COUNTY TO CONTROL THAT AND SISTER DIRECTLY SERVE THEIR POPULATIONS- DS EACH WILL RETAIN CONTROL OF ANY OTHER PROGRAM THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THE PARTICIPATING COUNTY SO ANYBODY ELSE WHO- ARE ANY OTHER I. S. T. CLIENT THAT IS BEING REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT. CAN BE SERVED BY THOSE. UNDERSTANDING PROGRAMS. DO NEED A WE HAVE NUMBERS ON IT. AND CONTROLLING FOR POPULATION COUNTIES THAT HAVE MORE IN THIS POPULATION THAN OTHERS SO I GUESS I'M THINKING THAT COUNTIES THAT HAVE REALLY GOOD GOOD COMMUNITY SUPPORT SYSTEM SET UP PERHAPS WOULDN'T HAVE AS MANY REFERRALS INTO THIS WERE ARE WE ABLE TO TRACK THAT ACROSS THE STATE. WE DO TRACK- WE DO TRACK ALL OF THE REFERRALS THAT COME IN FROM FROM ANY- COUNTY- I CAN'T SAY THAT LEAVES IN TERMS OF LOOKING BROADLY ACROSS. THE ENTIRE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE ON EACH OF THOSE COUNTIES- HAS MADE YOU KNOW SORT OF EVALUATIONS OR OBSERVATIONS IN TERMS OF HOW THAT CORRELATES TO BURN. RATE AND HIGHEST SHE REFERRALS THAT COME TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS. I GUESS WE CAN DRAW THE AT I MEAN THAT THE CORRELATION BUT IT WOULD SEEM THAT PEOPLE ARE BETTER COUNTY SYSTEM SET UP WOULD HAVE FEWER PEOPLE BEING REFERRED TO THIS FIFTEEN TIMES LATER- DEPARTMENT FINANCES YOUR HAND UP. YES THANK YOU WE HAD OUR RAMOS A PERMANENT FINANCE. WHICH IS LIKE TO ASK WHILE AGO A LOT OF THE COMMENTS. OUR STATE. DEPARTMENT OF HOSPITALS HAS. ON NOTED WE AGREE WITH THE L. A. THAT INCREASING THE FUNDING FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS JB CTAS AND- CPR'S- HAS MERIT. WE WILL NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND TO DO JUST THAT. WE ALSO AGREED THAT- INCLUDING EYES HE SPECIFIC RESOURCES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS. ALSO HAS MERIT AND AS SUCH FOR EXAMPLE THE CALAMP ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. PORTION. INCLUDES- AND- ARE INTO AT RISK CONSISTS XIN SO- BACK INCLUDE RISK I HE'S- HOWEVER WE THINK THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ADDRESS THAT. AND THEN JUST THE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO BETTER ADDRESS THE ESCALATING OF FELONY I ISSUE WEIGHTLESS. SO WE HAVE PROPOSED THIS COMMUNITY CARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT PROGRAM. OKAY WELL A LOT MORE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE STARTED PANICKING TO TIME. THANK YOU I THINK SILICON ESTIMATE FIRST OF ALL TWO ITEMS AGO ALSO APPLY TO THIS ONE BUT LET ME JUST ASK A QUESTION THEN WE- WE ACTUALLY HAD TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT TO AUTHORIZE THE HUNDRED MILLION THERE SEVERAL COUNTIES RIGHT THAT ARE GETTING FUNDING. CORRECT NINETY ONE. IN- SO- I JUST DID THAT MAKE THE CORE ISSUE IS THE- I. S. T. BACKLOG. SO AT THIS POINT IN TIME GIVEN THIS FUNDING. WHAT IS. THE OUTCOME WE'RE EXPECTING HOMES WHAT REDUCTION AN ICY BACKLOG SHOULD WE EXPECT AS THE LEGISLATURE- FROM THE USE OF THIS FUNDING AND IF YOU DON'T ACHIEVE THAT AND I HOPE YOU WOULD AGREE THEN WE SHOULD STOP THE PROGRAM. SO WHAT IS THE OUTCOME MEASURE IN WHICH WE NEED TO CHIEF JUSTICE DECLARED THIS PROGRAM A SUCCESS OR FAILURE. SO THE FUNDING LEVEL THAT'S PROPOSED AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE FUNDING LEVEL I WON AND NUMBER FOR WHAT DE ICED TEA BACKLOG SHOULD BE SO THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT TWO YEARS NEXT YEAR WE SAY. THIS PROGRAM WORKED OR DIDN'T WORK. SO OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO- THEY MET INDIVIDUALS WITH AND- AT LEAST GET DOWN TO SIX FEET UNDER SIXTY DAYS I WHICH IS CURRENTLY THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER. THAT COURT DECISION BUT ULTIMATELY THE SOONER THAT WE CAN GET AND THE VISUALS INTO TREATMENT FOR I. S. T. THAT'S OUR ULTIMATE CALL BUT- THE SUCCESS WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR IS LOOKING TO GET OUR IT IS OUR MISSION TIMELINES FOR ALL OF THAT POPULATION. UNDER THE AGE. SO THAT WOULD CAUSE WHAT WOULD THAT DO TO THE BACKLOG IF WE DID THAT. SO THE NOT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT THE ADMISSION RATES ARE RIGHT SO IF YOU CAN SET ARE AND AS WE BRING ON CAPACITY OUR ADMISSION RATE INCREASE. SO THAT NUMBER IS ALWAYS CANDIDATES ENGINES ARE REALLY HAD A LOOK AT WHAT THEY'VE ALREADY MONTHS WORTH OF EMISSIONS ARE YOU KNOW RATE IS. ORDERED KNOW THAT YOUR AND YOUR WEIGHT LIST IS WITHIN THAT OKAY. I'M NOT NUMBER GONNA ALL KIND OF MOVED AND ON THE LOWER CAPACITY YEAH OKAY RIGHT SO. WELL THERE'S WELL LET'S SITE THE FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM IF I AND CORRECTLY IS ACTUALLY TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM HAVING TO GO AND RIGHT SO I REALIZE THAT. YOUR OVERALL WAITLIST HÃ¬NH. THE TIME ZONE MISSION IS SOMEWHAT IS OBVIOUSLY MAY FLUCTUATE DEPENDING ON THE CAPACITY HAVE WITHIN THE HOSPITAL. BUT AT LEAST WHAT A UNDERSTAND UNLESS I HEARD WRONG THE PURPOSE OF THIS FUNDING IS ACTUALLY TO PREVENT PEOPE FROM EVEN HAVING TO GO THERE TO YOU TAKE CARE. OF IT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL CORRECT. CORRECT OKAY ARE SO. WHEN THINGS AND- THAT I THINK IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND I AGAIN APPRECIATE WHAT ELIA SAID AND THIS IS BEEN A PROBLEM I THINK FROM THE BEGINNING WITH THIS PROPOSAL. WHEN I HEARD IT BACK IN- IN THAT PRIOR BUDGET YEAR IS THAT WE NEED MUCH CLEAR METRICS. AS TO WHAT. GIVEN AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE SPENDING WE'RE GOING TO GET FOR THIS MONEY. SO I REALIZE THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT APPROACHES PEOPLE MAY TAKE IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND SO FORTH GIVEN WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE BUT ULTIMATELY. WHAT IS GOING TO CHANGE. AS A RESULT OF THIS SO I REALIZE THAT YOU SAID YOU WANT TO REDUCE YOUR- YOU KNOW THE TIME- TO THE SIXTY DAYS THAT'S CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT- BUT SINCE IS A PREVENTION PROGRAM I MEAN HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT KEEPING THAT BECAUSE WE CHANGED A PASSING HOSPITALS BECAUSE THEN THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD PUT THE MONEY INTO THAT AND- WE'RE TRYING TO. UNDERSTAND THIS THIS FUNDING IS TO TRY TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM HAVING TO GO IN AND SO. ASIDE FROM THE FLUCTUATIONS IT MAY HAPPEN TO YOUR CAPACITY. WHAT MEASURES DO WE HAVE THAT ACTUALLY WILL. SHOW THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY BEING REFERRED. INTO. IN THE INTERVENTION COUNTIES CORRECT. SO IT GETS MONEY JUST MAKE SURE. TO CLARIFY THAT THAT THAT THE INDIVIDUALS MAY STILL BE BURKE. AN INCUMBENT IS DOWN FINAL BUT WILL BE TREATED IN THE COUNCIL SO- THERE IS A THERE MAYSTILL BE THIS IS THE FINDINGS. BUT THEY WILL BE AT IT ANY PARTICIPATING COUNTIES WILL BE TREATED IN THE COUNTY UNLESS THEY REFER INDIVIDUALS TO US AND IN IN THIS PROPOSAL WE ESTIMATE ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. OF THE ICE TEAS WILL STILL NEEDS TO BE REFERRED TO THE PARK. I'M AT THE FUNDING LEVELS PROPOSED. AS IF ALL IF WE ARE ABLE TO CON A PARTNER WITH ENOUGH YOUNG TEENS TO MEET THE LEVEL OF THE- BUT- HE'S THAT ARE RIGHT THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THIS PROPOSAL. WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WILL IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR- THAT COULD REDUCE OUR WAITLIST DOWN TO A TIME WHERE WE ARE. NEEDING THIS SIXTY DAYS BUT IT'S ALL REALLY DEPENDING UPON HOW MANY COUNTY STEP UP BEYOND THAT THAT'S PART OF. THAT RIGHT YOU ALSO ALREADY HAVE A. CITY COUNTIES WERE ON BOARD CORRECT. PARDON YOUR HAVE A SAID IT STAR BOY CORRECT. POLICE DEPARTMENT. SO FOR THIS PROPOSAL STILL ACTUALLY AND WITH COUNTIES WE DON'T ANYTHING ON WALKING. OUT OKAY SO SINCE WE PASSED TWENTY WE STILL DON'T HAVE ANY COUNTIES ON BOARD. NO THAT I'M MAKE SURE GROUP OUT OF THEIR FOUR YEARS LATER I MEAN THAT'S NOT GOING TO SEE THIS NOT OF YOU PROPOSAL FOR THIS YEAR THIS IS A PROPOSAL WE HEARD BACK WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN WAS STILL GOVERNOR SO YOU KNOW GOVERNOR'S HAS BEEN IN OFFICE FOR A LITTLE WHILE. ACTUALLY TWO DIFFERENT PROPOSALS THE ONE THAT WE JUST PRESENTED IS THE COMMUNITY FAIR FIBER TO A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT I'M NOT OPPOSE ALL IS A BRAND NEW PROPOSAL IN WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE YOUR OWN VIEWS THIS IS FOR THEM TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF ICE TEAS FROM THERE COUNTY. AND-THE PRIOR PROPOSAL THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS THAT THE VERSION PROPOSAL RIGHT WHICH IS SMALL SUBSET OF INDIVIDUALS- WHO COULD BE FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL OR WHO MAY BE AT RISK OF BECOMING IRAQI AND SO THAT'S JUST A SMALL SUBSET IT WAS ONLY AND- DESIGNED THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS PROPOSING TO TREAT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND- FIFTY INDIVIDUALS ALTHOUGH READ THE CONTRACT. COUNTIES THAT THEY HAVE- AT COMMITTED TO SERVING A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT I'M ANTECEDENTS PRESENTED BUT AND THAT'S ITTHAT'S A SMALLER SUBSET IT WAS ONLY DESIGNS READ A SMALL. SUBSET THANK SO I THINK I FOR AWHILE THE L. A. PRISON- AND I THINK IF I HAD MORE TIME TO DO. AT THE INTO IT I THERE'S A LOT OF THAT. THE LACK OF CRITICAL. IN TERMS OF THE OUTCOME AND WE WOULD MEASURE. WHETHER WE CHEESE THE GOALS ARE NOT. SO HOPING THAT BETWEEN NOW AND MAY REVISE YOU CAN GREATER CLARITY- ELLIE- CAN YOU JUST COMMENT TO MY ASKING THE RIGHT LINE OF QUESTIONS ARE NOT. YOU'RE SUGGESTING REJECT THIS ALL TOGETHER BUT I MEAN I SO YES. YEAH I THINK YOUR YOUR LINE OF QUESTIONING MAKES MAKES TOTAL SENSE AND THAT THERE THERE SHOULD BE SORT OF MORE CLARITY ON THE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS- PROPOSAL- I'D AS- THERE IS SORT OF A- I DATA GATHERING IN DATA- EVALUATION COMPONENT TO THIS PROPOSAL AND- IT. I WOOD MAY BE DEFERRED TO THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW TO SORT OF DESCRIBE- DOPE THAT THOSE COMPONENTS OF THE COMPOSED THE PROPOSAL. OUR ISSUE WITH THE PROPOSAL IS- NOT SORT OF WITH THE CONCEPT OF MAKING COUNTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR IT- FOR THIS FOR THIS TREATMENT IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM AND- ITS SORT OF THE SET UP IN A WAY THAT. MAKES WHETHER OR NOT THESE THE SORT OF LIKE FRONT END INVESTMENTS ARE- YOU KNOW SUBJECT UNCERTAINTY IN AND- AB. MAKES IT SO THAT YOU KNOW THE INCENTIVES WHICH COUNTIES WILL OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL FIRST OF ALL I THINK HAVING SOME CLEAR OUTCOMES FOR WHATEVER THE PROGRAM'S GOING TO BE IS GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CLARITY AS TO- ALSO HOW THIS. INTEGRATES BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE JUST GONNA SILO ICE WHEN A FRAGMENT ALL THESE DIFFERENT WE HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS THAT MAY BE OVERLAPPING AND SO FORTH- WITH SOME OF THE EXISTING ONES THAT AGAIN WE'VE REALLY HEARD ABOUT FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS. SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET MUCH MORE CLARITY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT. WE'RE DOING HERE I THINK THAT IS CERTAINLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS NOT SOMETHING WE DISAGREE WITH. US AT LEAST I'D DISAGREE I WANT USE WE- DON'T SPEAK FOR EVERYONE ELSE BUT- I DO I DO. THINK THAT THERE'S SOME LACK OF CLARITY AS TO WHAT THE- GOALS ARE. AND OF HOW DO WE MEASURE WHETHER. THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT. SO HAVING CLARITY ON THAT AND THEN HAVING SOME MORE CLARITY ON HOW THIS THEN WILL INTERFACE WITH ALL THE OTHER PROGRAM SO WE'RE NOT DOING DUPLICATION OR FRAGMENTATION. AS WELL AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE BOTH THE DIVERSION PROGRAM WHICH IS WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR YOUR DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE COUNTY WE'VE OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS AS WELL. YOU KNOW AND EACH OF US AS SO FORTH SO. I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL- TO BE ABLE TO CLARIFY. BEFORE PROVING- SOMETHING THAT'S- AT THIS POINT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND- THIRTY THREE MILLION. DOLLARS OR- TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS SO- SO. IF WE CAN GET THAT. CLARIFIED THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. SO THE WAY I UNDERSTAND IT. THE MORE WITH THE MORE WE TALK ABOUT IT. THE SMALLER SUBSET IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE NOT. WILL NOT CYCLING THROUGH FIFTEEN TIMES BEFORE THEY ARE FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL THAT'S THE OTHER SUBSET. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT ABLE TO. BE ABLE TO MEET THE DEADLINE OF SIXTY DAYS FROM WHEN SOMEONE IS FOUND BEEN FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL UNTIL THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE BEEN TREATED AND PREPARED. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ON RIGHT THAT THE STATE. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO TREAT THOSE PEOPLE SO WE'RE SAYING LET'S LET THE COUNTIES DO WHAT'SAND THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE ANYWHERE ANYWAY. AND WILL WE WILL TRY TO INCENTIVIZE THEM BUT- IT AGREED I DON'T KNOW HOW. HOW WE INCENTIVIZE THEM MEDIA FOLKS ALREADY I OUR COUNTY THAT. THAT HAVE CYCLED THROUGH AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THESE ARE NOT STRANGERS TO THAT SYSTEM. THAT WE'RE NOW SAYING OKAY NO YOU GET THE MONEY TO STAND TRIAL WITH OUR SUPPORT. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT BEING ABLE TO MEET THE SIXTY DAY IS THAT ONE OF YOUR OUTCOMES THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MEET. WHAT ACROSS ALL OF OUR PROPOSALS THAT IS ULTIMATELY THE GOAL IS ANYBODY THAT LANDS ON. THE WAIT LIST. IS ADMITTED WITHIN SIXTY DAYS. THREE I'M NOT BEEN MOUNTED TIME THAT IT TAKES TO ACTUALLY RESTORE SOMEBODY. AND THEY THEY CAN STAY WITHIN OUR SYSTEM UP TO TWO YEARS BUT IT'S THE IT'S ABOUT SIXTY DAYS AROUND MUNITION ONLINE. AND TRYING TO CONNECT PEOPLE. THEM WITHIN THAT TIME LINES INTO A PROGRAM SO THEY GET TIMELY ACCESS TO TREATMENT TO BE RESTORED SO THAT THEY CAN BASE THEIR- THEY'RE CHARTS- BEYOND HAPPY. AND THE PROCESS- I WOULD SAY ABOUT IT. FROM A FROM THE PROGRAM. ITSELF YES IT'S ONE OF THOSE ALL OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS ALL OF BE. THE DIVERSION AND BEAT HERE ARE. YEARS OF ADDING POSSIBLY AT THE STATE HOSPITALS. OUR BE PARTNERING WITH THE JAILS TO EXPAND CAPACITY INTO THE JAILS AND THEN BE COMMUNITY BASED. PROGRAM WITH LA AND NOW OUR IN THE EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND NOW THIS- THE CDP ARE ALL WORKING TOWARDS THAT GOAL AND MAKING SURE THAT ANY DEFENDANT. WHO GETS- I. FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE IN THE STATE. GETS ACCESS TO TREATMENT- IN IN A TIMELY MANNER SO THAT THEY CAN PROGRESS THROUGH THEIR DUE PROCESS AND NOT ALTERNATELY THE GOAL NO MATTER WHAT INDIA. BUT. A PROPOSAL- WITH RESPECT TO THIS PURPOSE- IT. IS IT IT'S KIND OF BAD. LAST THE OPERATE. THAT THE DEBT WHEN THEY CONTACT US WE- THEM. AND THEN WITH SOME THEM BACK TO BACK YOU KNOW. AND THEY REALLY ARE TO FINE WE- AND THAT. TO THEIR- WHAT FIND IS THAT IN. LIKE WORKING WITH NOT IN THIS. BE REST. PROGRAMS HAVE THE COUNTY HAS ALL OF THE SERVICES AND CAN IN HER WORK ACOSTA JUSTICE PARTNERS. AND TO BE ABLE TO REALLY CONNECT ART THE COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS TO THE BROADER CONTINUUM OF SERVICES TO REALLY- I'M MORE HOLISTICALLY TREAT THIS INDIVIDUAL AND PROVIDE OPTIONS FOR- AT BAR SHE'S CALLED THAT PERSON PRESSES AFTER THAT AND THERE MAY THEY'VE BEEN RESTORED TO COMPETENCY SO. IT'S. MORE OF A- AN OPPORTUNE FOR BY OUT FOR THE IN THE THEN JUST SENDING A MISTAKE IN RE BACKED COURT. AND NOW WE HAVE ALL OF THE PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO TOUCHING THIS PERSON WANTS TO BECOME IS TO BE AND WORKING TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIND. AT TO PROVIDE THE BEST OUTCOMES FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL. AGAIN I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS. ARGUING WITH WITH THE- WITH THE DESIRE DR. SO I THINK AGAIN AT THE- CLARITY'S HELPFUL SO FIRST OF ALL- WHAT YOU JUST EXPLAIN TO ME NOW MAKES ME THINK IS THIS PROGRAM ABOUT AND AGAIN VERY WORTHY GOAL THAT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S ADMITTED TO THE STATE HOSPITAL YOU DO YOUR TREATMENT NOW YOU DISCHARGED THEM AND NOW YOU WANT BE SURE TO GET SERVICES AFTER THIS START SO THEY DON'T. MIGHT CRASH AGAIN WHICH IS CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT BUT THAT SOUNDS DIFFERENT AND- I'M NOT SURE HOW TO HELP WITH THE SIXTY DAYS BUT- BUT IT'S AGAIN I THINK IS A WORTHY GOAL IN ITSELF SO I THINKS. TO SOME CLARITY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE- FOCUSING ON IT AND NOW AGAIN WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT PROGRAMS TO HELP PEOPLE AFTER DISCHARGE FROM THE HOSPITAL SO- IF THERE'S SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE THAT FIGHT AGAINST. I STILL SENT SOME I GUESS CONFUSION NOT NOT WORTHINESS BUT CONFUSION ABOUT WHERE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THESE PARTICULAR FUNDS AND HOW DO WE METRIC THE SUCCESSOR NIGHT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND- IF THERE NEEDS ALSO BE A PROGRAM TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE BETTER IN A GREAT COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING DISTRACTIONS THE HOSPITAL'S CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WANT TO BE. PART OF THAT AND THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF FUNDING OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS WE NEED TO DIRECTED THAT DIRECTION AS WELL. YEAH I THINK MAYBE I CREATED A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION I'M NOT IN THAT THIS ISN'T AROUND JUST SERVING THE POPULATION THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE HOSPITALS. AS THE CCP IS AROUND THE COMMUNITY THAT COUNTS BE TAKING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE I. IS TI AND THAT AND GET ADMITTING THAT I INSTANCE OF THEIR PROGRAMS AND ALL OF THAT COUNTY WORKING TOGETHER. THAT IS THAT THE PARTNERS IN THE COUNCIL WORKING TOGETHER TO A TREAT THAT INDIVIDUAL THERE'LL BE A FEW THAT WILL COME TO THE STATE HOSPITAL THEY NEEDED A HIGHER LEVEL OF TREATMENT AND WOULD ENGAGE WITH THE COUNTY. BUT ULTIMATELY THE LION'S SHARE OF THE POPULATION AND- WHO WE CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY WILL BE TREATED IN THE COUNTY ON THE SERVER BY THE COUNCIL. FOR WELL. I LOOK FORWARD OF THE CLEAR PROPOSED- INTERNET FEW MONTHS- AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WORK WITH L. A. O. AND HELPING US BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AGAIN AT ALL THE BORROWER THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW IT WILL BE VERY SUPPORT OF WHAT YOU ALL THE DIFFERENT ITEMS YOU TALKED ABOUT THE JUST. HOPEFULLY WE HAVE A BETTER WHAT WE'RE DOING. IN TERMS OF THE FOR THE SPENDING. THANK YOU. THANK YOUNG WILL DEFINITELY WORK BETTER TRYING TO FIVE FIVE AND IT IN THAT. MISSION THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
