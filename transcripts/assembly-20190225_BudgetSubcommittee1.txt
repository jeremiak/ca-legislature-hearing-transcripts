YEAR'S FIRST SUB ONE HEARING. I'D LIKE TO INFORM THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THIS YEAR. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ITEMS THAT WILL BE HEARD AND THEN ON DISCUSSION ITEMS AS SHOWN IN THE AGENDA TODAY THAT WILL BE BOTH FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN ISSUE ONE THE STATE OF THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH. IF WE CAN BEGIN BY TAKING ROLE THE ARAMBULA HERE FRAZIER HERE MATHIS PATTERSON. RAMOS [inaudible] RUBIO [inaudible] WHAT? GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M DOCTOR KAREN SMITH I AM THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER IN THE TRUCK FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WITH ME I HAVE BRENDA NUNEZ WHO IS OUR CHIEF DEPUTY OF OPERATIONS. SO. FIRST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE COMMITTEE FOR REQUESTING THAT CITY PH PROVIDE YOU WITH A REPORT ON THE STATE OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IN -- THINKING ABOUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IN THIS HEARING I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE ACTUALLY MEASURE. HEALTH WHAT'S IMPORTANT WHAT'S OUR PRIORITY IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND SO I ASKED A NUMBER OF STAFF FROM ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT TO STOP DOING WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AND TRY TO CREATE FOR YOU A HAND OUT THAT SUMMARIZES SOME OF THE KEY WAYS THAT WE LOOK AT HEALTH AND SO THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE. BEFORE YOU YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE ARE GRAPHS THINGS LIKE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS RESULTING FROM OF A PARTICULAR CONDITION OR DISEASE. THE NUMBER OF PREMATURE DEATHS WHERE EARLY DEATHS -- SO DUST OF YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD COUNT AS A HIGHER PRIORITY IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY. UNDER -- MORBIDITY OR HOW MUCH OF A THAT A DISEASE THERE IS A SUPPOSED TO DOCK WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE. HOW MANY CASES THERE ARE -- FOR HOW MUCH DISABILITY DO THEY COSTS AND OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME IS IT LIFETIME IS A CHORE TO SUPPORT AND THEN. ALSO. WHICH DISEASES COST MOST BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WE ARE TRYING TO BALANCE IN A VERY EXPENSIVE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. SO -- AND THEN FINALLY IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT YOU'LL SEE IN THERE THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE SEEN VERY OFTEN IS A A DISPARITIES INDEX. THIS IS LOOKING AT DISEASES BY WHICH OF THEM HAVE THE GREATEST DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES BASED ON THE SUB POPULATION THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE NEEDS IN PARTICULAR ARE DISEASES AND CONDITIONS. THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE OR CHRONICALLY DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES. AND THEN FINALLY THERE ARE THE REEMERGING OR EMERGING DISEASES. AND THEN THOSE THAT ARE INCREASING RAPIDLY ENOUGH TO PRESENT A CONCERN THAT IF THEY'RE NOT A DRASTIC ACTUALLY POSE A THREAT EITHER TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OR TO THE POPULATIONS HEALTH. SO COLLECTING AND ANALYZING DATA AND THEN TURNING IT INTO INFORMATION THAT INFORMS POLICY IN ACTION IS A FOUNDATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTION PARTICULARLY AT THE STATE LEVEL. AT CITY PAGE WE COLLECT. INFORMATION AND DATA ON MANY IN CONDITIONS WE MONITOR OVER TIME AND WE CREATE MANY REPORTS SOME OF WHICH I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN. INCLUDING LEGISLATIVE REPORTS AND OTHER KINDS OF REPORTS I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THREE OF THEM ONE IS -- THE COUNTY HEALTH STATUS PROFILES WHICH YOU MAY HAVE SEEN WE PUT THESE OUT ANNUALLY THIS CONTAINS STATE AND COUNTY DATA FOR A NUMBER OF INDICATORS THAT ARE RECOMMENDED BY THE CDC AND THE NATIONAL CENTER. FOR HEALTH STATISTICS AND THEN IT PROVIDES PERCENTAGES FOR THE COUNTIES AND RANKING HOW THEY RANK IN THE STATE BUT THEN COMPARES THEM TO THE HEALTHY PEOPLE TWENTY TWENTY NATIONAL. GOALS FOR THESE -- INDICATORS. WE ALSO PUT OUT WE DIRECT AND MANAGE THE LET'S GET HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. SAYS WHICH IS OUR STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN. AND THEN LET'S GET HEALTHY WE HAVE SPECIFIC INDICATORS THAT WE FOLLOW OVER TIME THAT ARE DESIGNED TO REFLECT PROGRESS IN SIX DIFFERENT GOAL AREAS -- THAT ARE OF WITH WHICH WE ARE ALIGNING WITH OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND OTHER PARTNERS TO TRY TO ADVANCE HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA. AND FINALLY THE SECOND EDITION OF OUR BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASE REPORT SHOULD BE COMING OUT FAIRLY SHORTLY AS WELL. BUT WE DON'T JUST GATHER DATA FOR DATA SAKE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO US THAT WE USE THAT INFORMATION TO HELP SET PRIORITIES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO DRIVE EFFECTIVE ACTION. AND IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE A FOCUS ON PREVENTION. AND THAT MEANS THAT WE DON'T JUST COUNT HOW MANY CASES OF A PARTICULAR THING THERE ARE BUT TO THE DEGREE POSSIBLE WE TRY TO SEE WHO IS IT IS BEING AFFECTED WHAT ARE THE INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY FACTORS THAT EITHER PUT PEOPLE AT RISK. OR PROTECTION AND THEN THE SAME DATA CAN ALSO BE USED TO EVALUATE INTERVENTIONS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE TO TRY. TO EAT DECREASE THOSE DISEASES AND CONDITIONS OVERALL. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS HEARING I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE STATE OF HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA BY DISCUSSING SOME EXAMPLES WHERE WE'VE HAD SOME SIGNIFICANT SUCCESSES. BUT THEN I ALSO WANT TO MENTION SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT THREATS THAT I SEE TO THE STATE OF OUT TO THE HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT I THINK IT'LL TAKE TO ADDRESS THEM. SO FIRST I'M GONNA START AT THE AT THE BROADEST POSSIBLE LEVEL. CALIFORNIA'S SEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LIFE EXPECTANCY -- IN NINETEEN NINETY CALIFORNIA RANK TWENTY FOURTH AMONG STATES WITH A LIFE EXPECTANCY AVERAGE OF SEVENTY SIX YEARS BUT ACCORDING TO MOST MORE RECENT REPORTS -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA RANK SECOND ONLY TO WHITE WITH AN AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF EIGHTY ONE YEARS THAT'S A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN LIFE EXPECTANCY OVER ALL. AND THIS WAS THE GREATEST GAME OF ANY STATE OVER THAT SAME TIME PERIOD -- IN CHRONIC DISEASES ALL THE RATES OF DEATH FROM CHRONIC DISEASE HAVE STEADILY IMPROVED OVER TIME THEY DO REMAIN SOME OF THE MOST COMMON AND COSTLY EXPENSE M. CONDITIONS. THAT WE HAVE IN 75% OF ALL DEATHS ARE ULTIMATELY DUE TO CHRONIC DISEASES. DISEASE AND CANCER -- BECAUSE NEARLY HALF OF ALL DEATHS -- AT APPROXIMATELY 25% EACH. WORRISOME FOR THE FUTURE IS THE FACT THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY SIX CALIFORNIA CHILDREN AND ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE TEENS ARE ALREADY OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE. A RISK FACTOR FOR CORONARY ARTERIES -- AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES INCLUDING DIABETES. AND THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AND CALIFORNIA'S INCREASED 34% BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THREE IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN AS OF 20169% OF ALL ADULTS OR TWO POINT SIX MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES. AND EVEN MORE CONCERNING -- MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PRE DIABETES. AND THAT END WITHOUT INTERVENTION ON AVERAGE ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR OF THOSE PEOPLE WILL GO ON TO DEVELOP DIABETES. THIS HAS HUGE RAMIFICATIONS BOTH FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND HEALTH OVERALL BUT ALSO FOR THE COST OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND RATES OF DIABETES ALL OF OUR DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION. THE RATE IN IMPERIAL COUNTY IS THE HIGHEST AT FOURTEEN POINT 8%. AND IN MARIN COUNTY WITH THE LOWEST AT TWO POINT 6%. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION BUT WE ALSO DIABETES IS A DISEASE WHERE WE CAN REALLY SEE. THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. DIABETES RATES AMONG WHITES 27% WHILE IT IS AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS 9% AND AMONG LATINOS AND RATES ARE THREE TIMES HIGHER IN PEOPLE WHO DID NOT COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL THEN THEY AREN'T WHO COMPLETED COLLEGE. AND THEY ARE TWICE AS HIGH IN FAMILIES LIVING UNDER THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO EACH OF THESE. CHRONIC DISEASES HAS IT'S ROOTS IN SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY FACTORS AS WELL. BUT WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN MANY CHRONIC DISEASES INCLUDING CANCER HEART DISEASE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND STROKES. OVERALL THE RATES IN ALL OF THESE HAVE DECREASED. MANY FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THAT DECREASE INCLUDING -- X. TERRIFIC EXTENSION EXPANSION OF AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY HEALTH CARE AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES BUT CALIFORNIA'S ALSO MADE SOME IMPORTANT POLICY CHOICES. A GOOD EXAMPLE IS AROUND SMOKING REMAINS THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREMATURE DEATH TO DISEASE AND DISABILITY EVEN THOUGH RATES OF DEATH FROM LUNG CANCER RESPIRATORY ILLNESS AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE HAVE BEEN DECREASING. IT'S STILL THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF PREMATURE DEATH. BUT CHANGES IN POLICY ENACTED BOTH AT THE STATE AND THE LOCAL LEVEL HAVE HAD A MAJOR IMPACT. CALIFORNIA SMOKING RATES HAVE DROPPED 54% AMONG ADULTS DOWN TO TEN POINT 1%. ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRY. AND DOWN TO FOUR POINT 3% FOR YOUTH IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND BY TWENTY FOURTEEN LUNG CANCER MORTALITY IN CALIFORNIA DROPPED 43% AND WAS 30% LOWER THAN THE REST OF THE NATION AND THIS IS GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS OVER TIME AS WE HAVE MORE AND MORE ADULTS WHO NEVER HAD. EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO EITHER DIRECTLY OR SECOND HAND. SO THEN I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME ISSUES THAT I SEE IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO PUBLIC HEALTH OVERALL THAT ARE OR MERGING. OPIATES AS YOU ALL KNOW ARE DRUGS THAT ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR PAIN RELIEF. THINGS LIKE CODEINE HYDROCODONE IN FENTON ALL ARE THE WORDS THAT YOU'LL HEAR MOST FREQUENTLY IN THIS CONVERSATION. AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL RATE OF OPIOID ASSOCIATED OVERDOSES AND DEATHS IS MUCH LOWER THAN THE NATIOAL AVERAGE. WITH NEARLY TWO THOUSAND OPIOID ASSOCIATED DEATHS AND OVER EIGHT THOUSAND HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. ADMISSIONS AND TWENTY FOUR MILLION PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN EVERY YEAR FOR OPIATES WE STILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. LIKE THE REST OF THE NATION CALIFORNIA'S BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THIS ISSUE FOR OVER A DECADE. THE RECENT SHARP INCREASE IN IN OVERDOSES AND DEATHS THAT HAS GARNERED SO MUCH ATTENTION IS LARGELY DUE. TO THE I A POORLY UNDERSTOOD -- BASICALLY MALFUNCTIONING -- PRESCRIPTION PAIN MANAGEMENT ISSUE BUT IN RECENT RECENT THE LAST TWO YEARS DESPITE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT HAD INITIALLY DECREASED PRESCRIPTION RELATED OPIOID OVERDOSES AND US. THE EPIDEMIC HAS INCREASINGLY SHIFTED NOW TO ILLICIT DRUG USE. WE'VE WE HAVE HAD SOME SUCCESS. OPIOID PRESCRIBING RATES HAVE DECREASED SHARPLY SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN I'M PRESCRIPTION OPIOID ASSOCIATED DUST REACHED THEIR LOWEST LEVEL IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS IS ALL GOOD NEWS. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT HEROIN ASSOCIATED OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE INCREASED 97% SINCE. TWENTY TWELVE AND FENNEL ASSOCIATED US HAVE INCREASED FOUR HUNDRED AND 23%. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM THAT WILL REQUIRE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS AND THOSE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO USE TO BRING DOWN PRESCRIBING RATES. THERE IS WHY GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN THE OPIOID CRISIS ALSO WITHIN THE OUR NORTHERN RURAL COUNTIES HAVING THE GREATEST BURDEN OF DISEASE AND THE MOST ADVERSE OUTCOMES. ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE THAT IS GETTING LESS ATTENTION IS SUICIDE. SUICIDE RATES HAVE DECLINED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES BUT THEY'VE INCREASED IN THE MOST RECENT DECADE AND ARE NOW DOUBLE THE HOMICIDE RATES. IN FACT SUICIDE ACCOUNTS FOR NEARLY TWICE THE NUMBER OF DATE DEATH STATE WIDE AS OPIOIDS OR HOMICIDE. AND IT'S ONE OF THE TOP TEN CAUSES OF PREMATURE DEATH IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE KNOW THAT SUICIDE IS ACTUALLY UNDER REPORTED ON DEATH CERTIFICATES TO THE THE PROBLEM IS EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT. MEN COMMIT SUICIDE AT THREE TIMES THE RATE OF WOMEN. THAT ARE TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO USE A FIREARM. AND WHILE THE HIGHEST RATES AMONG MALES ARE IN THOSE OVER EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE SUICIDE IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUTH AGES. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR AND THAT SHOULD CONCERN US ALL TREMENDOUSLY. MANY OF THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT SEE HIGH RATES OF OPIOID OVERDOSES PARTICULARLY NOR THE NORTHERN RURAL COUNTIES ALSO EXPERIENCE ASIDE RATES HIGHER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE. AND THEN FINALLY I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES IN THE SHARP INCREASE THAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE STATE. THERE WERE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES OF STDS REPORTED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH IS UP AND PERHAPS THE GREATEST CONCERN IS THE RESEARCH TIRE LEAP PREVENTABLE CONDITION OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING AT LEAST 70% OF POTENTIAL CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CASES BY DETECTING IT EARLY IN TREATING. THE MOTHER THERE WERE STILL TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE CASES OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THIRTY SURPLUS ASSOCIATED STILLBIRTHS. THAT'S THE HIGHEST IN TWENTY YEARS. MOST OF THE WOMEN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO BABIES WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. HAD DID NOT RECEIVE ADEQUATE OR TIMELY PRENATAL CARE. WHICH COULD HAVE PREVENTED TRANSMISSION. THE MOST COMMON MATERNAL RISK FACTORS FOR CONGENITAL SYPHILIS WERE SUBSTANCE USE HOMELESSNESS THE EXCHANGE OF SEX FOR MONEY OR DRUGS AND CONTACT WITH THE SALE WITH THE JAIL SYSTEM. SO STRANGE AS IT MAY HAVE SEEMED FROM THE OUTSIDE AS WE TALK ABOUT THE RISK FACTORS FOR THESE THREE EMERGING CONDITIONS. FATAL AND NO FATAL OVERDOSES SUICIDE SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES SURE MANY OF THE SAME UNDERLYING CAUSES. AND THEY ARE INCREASING DESPITE THE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS WE'VE MADE EXPANDING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HER HEALTH CARE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IN LARGE PART THIS IS BECAUSE THESE DISEASES ARE NOT JUST DISEASES OF PEOPLE BUT OF COMMUNITIES AND OF SOCIETY OVERALL. AND THERE ARE RISING AT A TIME WHEN INCREASING NUMBERS OF CALIFORNIANS SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD THE BASIC COSTS OF LIVING THINGS LIKE HEALTHY FOOD. AND STABLE HOUSING. HOPELESSNESS AND DESPAIR ARE COMMON SYMPTOMS REPORTED IN ALL OF THESE CONDITIONS [inaudible] THESE. ALSO HAVE THEIR ROOTS IN ADVERSE EXPERIENCES IN CHILDHOOD THINGS LIKE POVERTY. VIOLENCE AND OTHER FORMS OF TRAUMA. AND STICK MY REMAINS A POWERFUL BARRIER TO SEEKING HELP. IN ADDITION TO THAT EACH OF THESE REFLECTS -- AN INCREASING RELIANCE ON A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT ALONE SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO ADD TO FIX THEM BECAUSE IT CAN REALLY ONLY TREAT THE SYMPTOMS AND NOT THE ROOT CAUSES. ULTIMATELY ADDRESSING THESE AND OTHER DISEASES OF DESPAIR. AS I LIKE TO REFER TO THEM WILL REQUIRE A SYSTEM OF PREVENTION THAT ADDRESSES ROOT CAUSES LIKE POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS. AND VIOLENCE IN ADDITION TO A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT. CAN PROVIDE TREATMENT FREE FROM BIAS AND STIGMA AND THAT RECOGNIZES THAT MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH IS AS IN FOR GOAL AS PHYSICAL HEALTH TO THE WELL BEING OF PEOPLE. MAKING SIGNIFICANT AND SUSTAINABLE CHANGES IN THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO REQUIRE THAT WE HAVE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE SOCIAL PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL. FACTORS. THAT AFFECT HEALTH AND FIGURING OUT WHAT LEVERS WE CAN USE TO MOST EFFECTIVELY ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN A HEALTHY AND RESILIENT CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU DOCTOR SMITH AND BEFORE WE BEGIN I JUST WANT TO SEE IF ANYONE HAD ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. IF NOT THEN I WILL -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATHIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- JUST AS WE TALK ABOUT THE INCREASED RATES OF SUICIDE WITHIN OUR YOUTH IS THERE ANYTHING. LOOKING AT TIME LINES FROM WHEN WE STARTED IN OR DO YOU SEEN -- CONVERSATIONS OF ASSISTED SUICIDE WITHIN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM. TO I MEAN JUST. THE FACT THAT IT'S GOING INTO THESE KIDS' HEADS MUCH YOUNGER. JUST MAKES ME WONDER -- THIS IS THE THE INCREASE STARTED WELL BEFORE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WERE HAPPENING AND SEEMS TO BE MUCH MORE RELATED -- TO PARTICULARLY IN ADOLESCENCE A FEELING OF HOPELESSNESS AND THEY KNOW THEIR FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING AND THEY'RE STRUGGLING AND A FEELING OF ISOLATION SOCIAL ISOLATION IN PARTICULAR. IS ONE OF THE MAJOR CAUSES AND THEN IN SOME CASES -- SUBSTANCE USE OKAY USE I I'M JUST WONDERING BECAUSE I YEAH I HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN I GOT US THE QUESTION THE OTHER DAY HE'D HAVE WHAT'S THE SYSTEM SUICIDE. OH BOY HERE WE GO. SELL. ART THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAMOS FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS WATER -- TO BRING TO LIGHT OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I SEE THE DIFFERENT -- RATIO HIGHEST POPULATION OF NATIVE AMERICANS -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN IT'S PUT TO AGAINST THE DIFFERENT STATES IN THE UNITED STATES SO HOW ARE WE GETTING THAT MESSAGE OUT AND TO THOSE COMMUNITIES ALSO IN A WEEK COLLECTING DATA. TO MAKE SURE THAT. WERE ALSO TRACKING WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. YES WE DO WE DO ROUTINELY COLLECT DATA ON AFFECT ON NATIVE AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATIONS AS WELL -- MANY TIMES IN OUR REPORTS WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THEY WON'T BE REPORTED AND IT'S BECAUSE THE NUMBERS ARE SO SMALL THAT THERE IS PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING OVER TIME. THEY'RE NOT STABLE ENOUGH TO REPORT BUT WE DO COLLECT THAT DATA AND ACTUALLY IN OUR OUR OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITIES -- STRATEGIC PLAN. FOR A REDUCING HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH INEQUITIES THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION ON NATIVE AMERICANS. SPECIFICALLY BOUTS FOR EXAMPLE POPULATION THAT HAS A HIGHER RATES OF OF DIABETES AS WELL RAY THEY DON'T SHOW UP HERE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE STABLE RATES TO REPORT. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF DATE ON THE PRIORITY POPULATIONS WORKING IN THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY TO TRY VERY HARD TO GET OUT THE OTHER AREA WHERE WE'RE DOING THAT IS WE HAVE A SPECIAL FOCUS IN OUR OPIOID. ESPECIALLY THIS COMING YEAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR A ALLOW ME TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT -- THE RATIOS -- WITHIN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY OUTPACE SOME OF THE OTHERS -- THAT ARE OUT IN OUR COMMUNITY SO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THAT AND THANK YOU -- FOR FOCUSING ON THOSE AREAS WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING A LOT MORE DOUBT ON THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES HI DOCTORS JUST TOOK JUST A QUICK QUESTION AS AS WE TALK ABOUT OPIOIDS GASES. ARE YOU ARE YOU COMFORTABLE IN A AND A AND M. AND THIS IS HONEST QUESTIONS I REALLY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER -- WITH THE WAY -- DEATHS THAT MIGHT BE LINKED TO OPIOIDS ARE ACTUALLY -- CALCULATED -- I'D I DO WONDER WITH ESPECIALLY WITH -- OLDER AMERICANS -- OLDER OLDER CALIFORNIANS WHO MAY BE ON HIGH DOSES OF OPIOIDS -- IS YOU KNOW THIS THAT IN THAT BEING A THERE IN IN IN IN AN EARLIER TASK. SO I WONDER IF IS THAT. BEING TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IS THAT A POSSIBILITY OR THE NUMBERS POTENTIALLY UNDER REPORTED -- A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS SENIORS DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE ON HIGH DOSES OF OPIATES IF THEY'RE ALSO THEIR NUMEROUS OTHER MEDICATIONS PARTICULAR BENZODIAZEPINES AS WELL. IN FACT WE'RE GOING TO BE LAUNCHING -- LATER THIS YEAR A AN EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED AT OLDER AMERICANS HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND. MY MOTHER FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FOR MEDICATIONS IS AN OPEN RIGHT AND SO -- THAT SOMETHING THAT WE THINK NEEDS ATTENTION THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT THEY'RE UNDER REPORTED PARTICULARLY ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSES THAT -- MAY CONTRIBUTE TO AN EARLIER DEATH THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE OR A COMBINATION OF POLY PHARMACY MULTIPLE DRUGS AT THE SAME TIME SUPPRESSING RESTORATION. HOW WE GET A HANDLE ON THAT IS REALLY DIFFICULT MOST PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HAVE AUTOPSIES? CORNERS ARE OVERWHELMED DEALING JUST WITH THE THE CASES THAT THEY DO HAVE WE DO HAVE A PROJECT ON GOING WITH CORNERS RIGHT NOW WERE -- ENGAGED WITH AYE WE BURKE FROM PROVIDING FUNDING. FOR THEM TO TRANSFER TO A THEY HAVE A VERY RICH DATA ABOUT THE THE CASES THAT GET REFERRED TO CORNERS THAT INCLUDE A LOT OF THE SOCIAL SITUATIONS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF DEATH. AND WE THINK BY LOOKING AT THAT INFORMATION WILL THINK WE WILL SEE SOME SENIORS IN THAT POPULATION AS WELL. SO FAR. SO CORNERS ROUTINELY DO TOXICOLOGY SKI -- PANELS ON ON PEOPLE DIE UNDER WE HAVE RISE SO OR OPIOIDS NOT TRADITIONALLY A PART OF THAT PANEL. THEY ARE THE THE DIFFERENCES THAT. SENIORS ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO ACTUALLY -- BE TAKEN UP AS A CORONER'S CASE SO WHEN SO WHEN SOMEONE'S DIED UNEXPECTEDLY WERE IN THE HOSPITAL THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN WILL CALL THE CORONER'S OFFICE WITH THE CORONER'S OFFICE DOESN'T HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO TAKE THAT PERSON IF THERE'S A REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY MAY HAVE DIED THAT'S PARTICULARLY. TRUE IN PEOPLE OVER EIGHTY FOR EXAMPLE TO THEY RARELY END UP GOING TO A CORNER [inaudible] THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU OF DOCTOR WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE WELL BEING OR THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THE CHILDREN. AND YOU LOOK AT THE SILOS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED ABOUT THE WELL BEING THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND THE HEALTH SYSTEM. WE LOOK IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN THE SCHOOLS HAD PSYCHOLOGIST IN ATTENDED TO THE CHILDREN AND GUIDANCE. COUNSELORS. WHEN THERE BE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO CO MINGLE. WITH SCHOOL THE SCHOOLS AND ALSO HEALTH CARE -- INDUSTRY. BECAUSE I AM ITALIAN SOLANO COUNTY WHERE I REPRESENT. WE HAVE ZERO PEDIATRIC CRISIS BEDS [inaudible] ZERO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT THEN THEY AUTOMATICALLY GO TO THE HOSPITAL. INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AFTER NOT SEVENTY OF FIFTY ONE FIFTY THAT SEVEN TWO HOURS THE RELEASED AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME WITH NO REAL CARE. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WELL BEING. SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT A HOLISTIC APPROACH. AND THE WHOLE OVERALL -- A DEPUTATION OF MENTAL HEALTH STABILITY FOR THE CHILDREN. I COULDN'T AGREE MORE I THINK THAT IT'S NOT JUST SCHOOLS SCHOOLS ARE VITAL IS PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNGER KIDS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS IDENTIFYING CHILDREN. EARLY WHO HAVE RISK FACTORS FROM GOING ON TO HAVING SUBSTANTIAL BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS AND WE KNOW WHAT MANY OF THOSE ARE BUT AS YOU PUT IT AS YOU'VE MENTIONED. OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM HAVE WE'VE LOST A LOT OF THE KINDS OF ANCILLARY STAFF THAT WE USED TO HELP SCHOOL COUNSELORS NURSES AT CETERA -- WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASING NUMBER SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CLINICS AND I KNEW THAT THAT WILL HELP BUT IT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH WE WE WAIT TOO LONG PARTICULARLY IN THE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND TELL SOMEONE IS IN CRISIS. WHEN THE BETTER TIME TO INTERVENE REALLY IS FURTHER? UP WHEN YOU FIRST START SEEING BEHAVIORAL ISSUES AND CAN I YOU KNOW IF IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH CHILDREN. AND DISCOVER WHAT THEIR SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES YOU TRIGGERS ARE FOR THE BEHAVIORS THAT ULTIMATELY BECOME UNMANAGEABLE. IT IS JUST ANOTHER PART OF ANOTHER QUESTION I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER BECAUSE IT DOES MEAN THAT EVERYBODY NEEDS. TO ABSOLUTELY 1100% NOTHING IT IS FAR AS PART OF THE OF THIS WHOLE. SURVEY THAT IS PUT TOGETHER IT'S VERY EXTENSIVE. CAN YOU SHARE WITH ME WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION OF THE THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED OR PART OF THIS ALSO BECAUSE THERE. THERE HAVE THEIR PART OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND SOMETHING THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT HAVE ALL OF THESE HEALTH ISSUES BUT THEY'RE HARD -- TO SCREEN EVEN EVEN IN SPECIAL OF HIS WIT INSTITUTE OF HEALTHY ATHLETES PROGRAM BECAUSE IT WORK GETTING ADEQUATE CARE. SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE'RE TOUCHING HIS POPULATION ALSO LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT THE NATIVE AMERICANS -- SO IN TERMS OF OF THE DATA THAT WE ACQUIRE SOME OF THE DATA SOURCES THAT WE HAVE ARE VERY SPECIFIC AND ASKING ABOUT DISABILITYTHAT'S WHY YOU SEE SORT OF DISABILITY ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS THAT WE THAT. BUT THERE ARE OTHER DATA SOURCES THAT JUST DON'T TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND SO IT REALLY IS GETTING A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE THE POPULATION LOOKS LIKE AS A WHOLE REQUIRES WE HAVE WELL OVER TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT DATA STREAMS AND THEY'RE ALL. THE DIFFERENT WHAT THEY COLLECTED ABOUT RAM AND WHETHER IT'S SURVEY AND SO IT'S A IT'S A HUGE LEFT TO KIND OF TAKE ALL OF THAT DATA. DO AN ANALYSIS IT KIND OF PUTS IT TOGETHER WE TAKE WE GO TO SPECIAL LANCS TO LOOK FOR DISABILITY BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OUTCOMES. IF YOU CAN DECREASE MORTALITY THAT'S GREAT BUT IF PEOPLE ARE LIVING FOR YEARS IN DISABILITY THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE PREVENTED SOMETHING IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEN THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE WORKING ON AS WELL AND SO I SHARE YOUR PRIORITY AS FAR AS WHETHER OR NOT. WE'RE PROVIDING THEM WITH ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT'S REALLY. I THINK PROBABLY NOT BUT I DON'T IT'S NOT AN AREA WHERE I HAVE MUCH EXPERTISE I HAVE TO SAY. APPRECIATE THANK YOU. DOCTOR WOULDN'T FOLLOW AT YES AND I'LL BE BRIEF I APOLOGIZE I SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS FIRST BUT THE NUMBER OF SUICIDE -- DOES -- ONE OF THE I JUST AND JUST MARON MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND BUT BUT ONE OF THE THE IN SOME OF THE BACKUP MATERIAL WHAT WE WILL BE SEEN AS SAID IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY RURAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE SUICIDE RATE IS. TWICE THE STATE AVERAGE THIS IS ON IS IS THERE ON DOING STUDIES TO DETERMINE. THE OTHER STUDIES OUT THERE IS WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING. THAT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE IN RURAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION. I THINK IT'SIT'S ESSENTIALLY THE SAME CONSTELLATION OF FACTORS THAT ARE DRIVING OPIOID USE AND AND OTHER ILLICIT DRUG USE -- IT IS A COMBINATION OF HAVING. A SICKLY SEEING NO WAY TO A FUTURE WHERE YOU THRIVE TWO PEOPLE ARE LIVING. BARELY MAKING. ENDS MEET. NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHAT THEY'D LIKE TO PROVIDE. NOT HADN'T NOT BEING WHERE THEY THINK THEY SHOULD BE AT THAT TIME OF LIFE AND SEEING NO WAY OF GETTING BETTER. PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHRONIC DISEASES IN PARTICULAR ALSO -- IF THEY LOSE IF IF YOU IF YOU DEVELOP A CHRONIC DISEASE THAT CAUSES DISABILITY AS YOU WERE MENTIONING EVEN TEMPORARY DISABILITY YOU CAN END UP LOSING A JOB THAT WAS ALREADY TENUOUS TO BEGIN WITH AND NOW SUDDENLY YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE HOMELESS OR CLOSE TO HOMELESS UNSTABLE HOUSE. ALL OF THOSE THINGS CONTRIBUTE TO FAIR AND WE THINK THAT THAT. IS NO ONE SINGLE FACTOR THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS CONTRIBUTING TO IT -- WHAT WE DON'T THINK IS HAPPENING IS INCREASE IN SORT OF ORGANIC BRAIN DISEASE THAT'S LEADING TO IS THERE FUNDAMENTALLY? ISSUES WITH POVERTY AND A LACK OF JOBS IN A WAY TO WAY OUT OF WHERE THEY CURRENTLY ON BASICALLY I GUESS WHAT AT POINT A LACK OF SERVICES YES I HAVE. SERVICES IN MANY OF OUR COMMUTER THIS IS THAT RECOGNIZE WHERE PEOPLE ARE AT THAT TIME AND AND PARTICULARLY WITH SPECIAL POPULATIONS LIKE THE HOMELESS POPULATION. WILL HAVE TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY'RE OUT AND TAKE AND DRUG USERS AS WELL. TAKES TIME TO GET THEM ONTO A PATH THAT SUSTAINABLE -- AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF SERVICE THAN SAY THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS ABLE TO PROVIDE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULDN'T -- DOCTOR SMITH I FORGOT HOW MUCH I LIKE SOMEONE HEARINGS SO SORRY IF I ACTUALLY. ENJOY WALKING OUT WITH YOU REGARDING MANY OF THIS MY PLEASURE. BUT BUT I WAS INTERESTED IN YOUR TERMINOLOGY USED HE SAID MUCH OF WHAT YOU REPORT ON OUR SYMPTOMS AND NOT THE ROOT CAUSES -- BASICALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT. THE DISEASE DISEASES LIKE CHRONIC DISEASES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. ARE SYMPTOMS OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD AND COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES AND THE INCREASING DIFFICULTY THAT PEOPLE HAVE IT BAD FEELING LIKE THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR LIVES. IN. IN I. E. AGREE WITH YOU THAT MOST OF OUR UNMET NEED IS IN FOR CHILDREN AS WELL AS COMMUNITIES. AND YET WE NEED SOME DATA POINTS THAT WE CAN TRACK AND FOLLOW SO THAT WE CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. SO WHEN YOU SAID THAT WE USE INFORMATION TO SET PRIORITIES AND TO DRIVE FOR ACTION. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT OUR COMMITTEE IS ALSO TRYING TO DO. AND THE ROLE OF THE STATE OF THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH WILL BE TO HELP DRIVE US TOWARDS ACTION. WHERE IT'S NEEDED THE MOST BASED ON THE SYMPTOMS THAT YOU PRESENT IN SO WE'RE WANTING TO PROVIDE SOME QUESTIONS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE RECURRING? DATA STREAMS COME BACK TO US I WELCOME THEM. FOR EXAMPLE THE CONGENITAL SYPHILIS THAT YOU BROUGHT UP. NEARLY A QUARTER OF ALL OF THOSE COULD GENERAL SYPHILIS OCCURRED IN FRESNO COUNTY IN THAT BACKYARD EXACT AND SO I'M QUITE AWARE OF SOME OF THESE DATA STREAMS BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO DO A LARGER ROLE TO HELP US TO DRIVE. PUBLIC POLICY AND HOPE THAT THIS CAN DO IT. MY QUESTION REALLY IS WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU FOR RESOURCES. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE WHAT YOU NEED? TO DO THE DIFFICULT TASK OF PROVIDING DATA TO THIS BODY SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT -- WE CAN ACT UPON THAT INFORMATION APPROPRIATELY. I'M NOT SURE I KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION -- I THINK IT IS YOU KNOW HONESTLY IN TERMS OF SOMETHING LIKE A STATE OF THE STATE. ADDRESS IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'VE EVER DONE. WE HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW TO GO ABOUT IT -- AND WE HAVE DONE SOME WORK AT THE REQUEST OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE LA -- ON WHAT IT WOULD TAKE AND JUST IN TERMS OF OF OF HUMAN RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY -- DO THAT THE CHALLENGE BEING THE VARIETY OF DATA THERE'S SO MUCH DATA THAT WE CAN'T PRESENT TO IN A SETTING LIKE THIS SO WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THOSE WOMEN WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS THAT COULD TELL US A LOT ABOUT WHAT THINGS WE COULD PUT IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS. IT -- BUT RENDON DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD ON THAT. MISTER CHAIR READINESS FOR THE DEPARTMENT SO. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN IMAGINE OUR DEPARTMENT PRODUCES QUITE A FEW REPORTS ONE OF THE THINGS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE BACK YOUR HAND OUT LISTED ACROSS THE TOP OR A NUMBER OF THOSE TYPES OF REPORTS THAT WE DO PRODUCE. ONE OF THEM DOCTOR SMITH MENTION WAS THE COUNTY HEALTH STATUS PROFILES REPORT WHEN WE WENT BACK AND JUST KIND OF TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION THOSE IN IN THE AGENDA AS FAR AS WHAT WE WOULD NEED AN RESOURCES WE LOOK AT WHAT SOME OF THESE REPORTS CLASSES AND I'M. NOT ON A BI ANNUAL BASIS WE'RE TO DO. PROBABLY AROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND GENERAL FUND AND THREE POSITIONS WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT TO PULL IN THE RESOURCES OF THE NEEDED TO DEVELOP. ONE OF THE REASONS WE WERE LOOKING AT A BI ANNUAL REPORT RATHER THAN AN ANNUAL REPORT WAS BECAUSE IT MIGHT PRODUCE YOU -- MORE COMPREHENSIVE INVALUABLE REPORT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO WE HAVE AN ANNUAL CUT OFF AS WE HAVE A REVIEW PROCESS AND IT CUTS OFF THE ANALYSIS TIME FRAME AND THINGS LIKE THAT. PRESIDENT EXTENDED OUT THERE -- TO IT EVERY TWO YEAR REPORT WOULD PRODUCE YOU OKAY SOMETHING ALSO THAT YOU'D BE ABLE TO COMPARE ACROSS REPORT TIME PERIODS AS WELL SO THAT'S WHY WE CAME UP WITH THE COSTS ON A TWO YEAR BASIS THE OTHER THING ABOUT -- TWO YEARS IS THAT. WHAT MOST OF THE DATA SOURCES THAT WE HAVE ARE NOT ANNUAL TWO YEARS IS MORE COMMON -- THE OTHER THING IS THOUGH THAT IT WOULDN'T PROVIDED A PREVENT US FROM PROVIDING UPDATES ON THE OFF YEARS ON SPECIFIC TOPICS WHICH ACTUALLY MIGHT ALLOW US TO DELVE MORE DEEPLY. THE CHALLENGE WITH THINGS LIKE THE COUNTY HEALTH STATUS FOR THEIR WONDERFUL IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING. FOR BUT THERE ISN'T A LOT OF WHAT I THINK OF AS INFORMATION THERE'S A LOT OF DATA AND BUT IT'S TURNING THAT INTO A STORY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD DO -- ENDEAVOR TO DO WITH REALLY IF YOU LOOK AT LET'S GET HEALTHY CALIFORNIA IT DOES NOT TO SOME DEGREE BUT ONLY FOR SELECTED INDICATORS WE WOULD BE DOING IT ON A BROADER SCALE. WELL I AM WON'T BELABOR THIS COMMITTEE ANYMORE BUT WOULD LIKE TO MEET WITH YOU OFF LINE IF WE COULD -- TALK MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT ANNUAL PURSES BIANNUAL -- BUT IT'S THE AND TENT OF THIS COMMITTEE TO GET UPDATED INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AND ACT UPON THEM AS WELL. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO THANK YOU WHEN YOU'RE READY? GREAT SO GOOD AFTERNOON -- JUST WANTED -- TO INTRODUCE -- FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- JENNIFER CAN'T DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THEN I'M JOINED TODAY -- ON VARIOUS OF THE PANELS FI AND BOTH OF MY CHIEF DEPUTIES AND I REFER TO THEM AS RIGHT HAND AND LEFT HAND. AMERICAN WELL AN ERROR BECAUSE FOR BACK AND THEN THEY WILL EACH HAVE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE AGENDA BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LETTING US -- BE HERE TODAY. HI MERRY CAM -- DH CS SO JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW THAT WAS REQUESTED OF THE DTS BUDGET. SO AS AS YOU WELL KNOW WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING CALIFORNIANS WITH ACCESS TO INTEGRATED CARE AND HIGH QUALITY CARE -- INCLUDING PHYSICAL DENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUR LARGEST PROGRAM OF COURSE IS THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM WHICH DOES PROVIDE A HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ABOUT THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE IS WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATING FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. THAT DOES CONTINUE A SLIGHT DECLINE THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING OVER THE PAST FEW BUDGET CYCLES. IN ADDITION TO MEDI CAL WE DO OPERATE INCLUDING THOSE FOR THOSE WITH SPECIFIC CONDITIONS WHETHER THEIR GENETIC DISORDERS CANCER TREATMENT PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS OVERSEEING THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES THAT COUNTIES. OPERATES. IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL DH CS BUDGET WE ARE PROJECTING FOR THE BUDGET YEAR A BUDGET OF A HUNDRED FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR TOTAL FIND. TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR BILLION OF THAT IS GENERAL FUND AND THE REST BEING FEDERAL FUNDS AND SPECIAL FUNDS. WE DO HAVE ABOUT THREE ABOUT A LITTLE UNDER FOUR THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AT EACH YES AND IN THE JANUARY THE BUDGET WE ARE PROPOSING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN NEW POSITIONS WHICH INCLUDES. EIGHT EXISTING LIMITED TERM THAT WOULD BE CONVERTED TO PERMANENT. THE MEDICAL ESTIMATE IS THE LARGEST PART OF THE G. H. YES BUDGET SO AS I MENTIONED OUR OVERALL BUDGET IS ABOUT HUNDRED FOUR BILLION THE MEDI CAL ESTIMATE. FOR THE BUDGET YEARS ABOUT A HUNDRED BILLION -- AT THE NOVEMBER ESTIMATE DID AS I'M SURE YOU'VE NOTED IN THE AGENDA PROJECT A REDUCED NEED FOR GENERAL FUND IN THE CURRENT YEAR. ABOUT TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS REALLY RELATED TO A HANDFUL OF OF THINGS ONE BEING -- SOME SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF DEFERRALS THAT THEY ISSUE TO US WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE MONEY BACK. AS WELL AS THEY DID NOT ISSUE DEFERRALS IN THE AMOUNTS THAT WE WERE ANTICIPATING. SO THAT'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE DO HAVE SOME INCREASED TRANSFERS TO THE GENERAL FUND FROM OUR PROVIDER TAXES BOTH THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND THE HOSPITAL PROVIDER TAX. WE WE SAW INCREASED DRUG REBATES WITH I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PROPOSED DRUG REBATE FUND AND A BETTER MANAGEMENT OF THAT FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY. AND THEN WE DID SEE SOME LOWER MANAGED CARE COSTAGAIN RELATED TO THE DECREASE IN CASE LOAN -- GIVEN THE ONE TIME NATURE OF ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THOSE -- POTENTIALLY EXCEPT THE CASE LOAD YOU DO SEE A A NEARLY EQUIVALENT INCREASE IN BUDGET YOUR OF TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS -- BUT SINCE I I PRESUME WILL HAVE EITHER TO LATER TODAY OR IN FUTURE HEARINGS MORE DISCUSSION OF THE MAJOR PROPOSALS I'LL JUST QUICKLY MENTION WHAT THEY ARE -- THE FIRST BEING THE EXPANSION OF FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL NOW TO THOSE UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX THIS IS EXPANDING ON THE SB SEVENTY FIVE EXPANSION THAT WAS FOR KIDS. ZERO TO EIGHTEEN WE ARE CONTINUING THE MOST OF THE PROP FIFTY SIX PAYMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING FOR THE LAST BUDGET YEARS. AND WE HAVE SOME NEW INVESTMENTS AS WELL BUT I KNOW WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT LATER. THERE'S ALSO FUNDING FOR HOUSING AND HOUSING RELATED SERVICES FOR OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT COUNTIES -- TO HELP SUPPORT THE PROVISION OF ACTUAL HOUSING SERVICES IN IN THOSE COUNTIES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE -- FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS THERE'S ALSO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR EARLY PSYCHOSIS OUT REACH DETECTION AND TREATMENT. AND THEN US FOLKS AS FOLKS ARE WHERE WE DO HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER RELATED TO PHARMACY BOTH -- THE CAR ABOUT IT MEDI CAL BUT THE LOWER BOOK PURCHASING SO WITH THAT I WILL STOP THERE IS IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AMERICAN WILL -- ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE ALL START FROM. YOU KNOW I HAD I HAD ASKED EARLIER REGARDING THE MCO TAX AND REALLY JUST WANT TO PUT ANOTHER MARKER AND IT AGAIN IF I COULD ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT SOURCE OF REVENUE AND A WILLINGNESS ON BOTH -- THIS COMMITTEE IN MY OFFICE SPECIFICALLY. TO WANT TO REACH OUT TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO WORK ON ITS TO ENSURE THAT WE COULD -- CONTINUE THE MCO AND JUST WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AS WE GO FORWARD. SO. THE FEEL RHETORICAL FOR ASKING BUT ARE THERE ANY REASONS WE SHOULDN'T BE WORKING ON IT OR ANYTHING THAT'S PROHIBITING US FROM -- MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE IT PASSED TOJUNE. YEAH AND THIS IS -- JENNIFER CAN -- I THINK THAT WE ARE WILLING TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION I THINK OBVIOUSLY WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW SOME OF IT WAS OBVIOUSLY RELATED TO THE THE TRANSITION IT'S A COMPLICATED TAX -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THE LAST TIME THAT THAT WE DID THIS BUT IT IS IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS -- IT CAME FROM MERRY SPRAIN AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET -- IT REQUIRES A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH THE INDUSTRY ITSELF AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE AS AND THEN THE FINAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I THINK THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION -- AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGEWITH YOUAND OTHERS AS THE AS THE BUDGET YEAR GOES ON I DIDN'T FEEL THE NEED TO EXTRAPOLATE ANY FURTHER THAN THE STAFF COMMENT OR QUESTION THAT WE HAD REGARDING THE PUBLIC CHARGING THE EFFECT THAT THIS IS. HAPPENING BUT JUST THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRACKING TREND THAT AND MONITORING. I WANTED TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT IF I COULD ON MENTAL HEALTH THIS YEAR AND JUST WANTED. TO PUT THIS IN AS A PRIMER FOR CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL HAVE LATER ON IN THE YEAR. BUT I'VE FOUND IT EASIER WHEN YOU LISTEN MORE THAN YOU TALK AND SO SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING. TO ME THE OTHER DAY DURING A MENTAL HEALTH CAUCUS THE AUTHOR OF PROP SIXTY THREE DARRELL STEINBERG SAID THAT THERE WERE SOME THINGS HE THINKS. HE COULD HAVE DONE A LITTLE BIT BETTER. AND SO I'M INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT POSSIBILITIES WE HAVE THIS YEAR? AND SO I HAVE BOTH SOME IDEAS AND SOME QUESTIONS ACTUALLY FOR THE LA -- BECAUSE I NEVER KNOW WHAT'S QUITE POSSIBLE AND HOW FAR WE CAN PUSH. BUT LET ME START WITH THE IDEA WHICH IS THAT EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION SERVICES CURRENTLY WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT MODELS WE HAVE. FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT ARE ALL DOING IT INDEPENDENTLY AND DIFFERENTLY. ARE THERE THAT MANY BEST PRACTICES. OR COULD WE COME UP WITH THE HANDFUL OF SUGGESTIONS. THAT WE PROMOTE TO THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE. DELIVERABLE METRICS AND OUTCOMES THAT WE CAN FOLLOW. THAT WE CAN BRING BACK AND ALLOW THE REGIONS ARE COUNTIES TO SELECT THEMSELVES WHAT THEY THINK IS BEST FOR THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. BUT BY DOING SUCH WERE ABLE TO REALLY DRIVE TOWARDS EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES TOWARDS MODELS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE AND COULD BE IMPLEMENTABLE. IN SEOUL WANTS -- TO WORK WITH THE ADMIN THE TERM STEINBERG CAME UP TO US. BUT ALSO TO SEE IF THE COUNTIES THEMSELVES HAVE ANY SPECIFIC IDEAS THAT ARE SEPARATE AND APART THAN WHAT HE CAME UP WITH. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT BY DOING THAT I THINK WERE BETTER ABLE TO ACTUALLY INTERVENE EARLIER. WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT GETS US TO THE SECOND PART THAT HE WE CAN CHANGE IT BUT HE SAID 80% OF THE DOLLARS WE SPEND IN PROP SIXTY THREE GOES TOWARDS TREATMENT. ONLY 20% TOWARDS EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION. IS THAT THE RIGHT RATIO. IS THAT THE RIGHT AMOUNT. COULD THERE BE A TRANSITION. AND THAT'S WHERE I BELIEVE I NEED THE LA YELLOWS AND PUT. IN WILL WANT TO MEET WITH THEM OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO HOPEFULLY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. HOW WE COULD THINK ABOUT THAT TYPE OF TRANSITION AND WHAT TYPE OF CHANGES WOULD BE NEEDED? IS IT SOMETHING THAT WILL NEED TO GO BACK TO THE PUBLIC. FOR SINCE PROP SIXTY THREE WAS INITIALLY PASSED. IS THAT A TWO THIRDS VOTE IS THAT A MAJORITY VOTE THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS MATTER. BUT AS WE START THINKING AND ARE CONTEMPLATING WHAT WE'RE DOING BOTH AND SUB. ONE I WANTED TO TAKE THIS MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND I BELIEVE THE NEEDS TO CHANGE THE WAY WERE FUNDING IT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HELP TO PREVENT DISEASE AND GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE. SO WITH THAT I JUST WANTED TO HOLD ISSUE TO OPEN. BUT WANTS TO WORK WITH BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND LA -- AFTER THIS TO CONTINUE THE SESSIONS. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE. THREE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BECAUSE FOR BACK HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO JUST AS A BIT OF BACKGROUND AND GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE MEDI CAL ESTIMATE -- WE INITIATED A DEPARTMENT WIDE EFFORT. TO EVALUATE OUR RESOURCES ARE PROCESS SEASON ARE SYSTEMS FOR FISCAL MANAGEMENT -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT JUST WRITE A LITTLE CONTEXT AS IS MERRY MENTION MEDI CAL IS IN OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM. WHICH OVER THE YEARS HAS GROWN BOTH IN SIZE AS WELL AS COMPLEXITY WITHOUT COMMENSURATE ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES OR SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS TO KEEP UP WITH THE PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY IT'S ON A CASH BASIS OF ACCOUNTING SO TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS ARE CRITICAL AND SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO MANAGE -- IT'S WORTH NOTING A 1% -- VARIANCE IN OUR ESTIMATE IS A BILLION DOLLARS OR TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND SO JUST JUST FOR CONTEXT -- SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES IN THE ESTIMATE -- GROWTH IN OUR MANAGED CARE PAYMENTS -- WE'VE GROWN TO APPROXIMATELY 80% OF BENEFICIARIES ABOUT 50% OF OUR PAYMENTS ARE TO MANAGE CARE WHICH PUTS A LOT OF MONEY AND RELATIVELY FEW PAYMENTS -- AND THERE ARE OPERATIONAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE PAYMENTS THERE ARE FEDERAL APPROVALS ASSISTED WITH THOSE PAYMENTS SO WE PUT A LOT OF MONEY. IN ONE AREA AND ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT SO THINGS LIKE QUALITY ASSURANCE FEES EVEN THEM CO TAXES AS YOU TOUCHED ON ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ARE MORE THAN -- FORTY THEY CREATE COMPLEX ACCOUNTING ISSUES AND TIMING ISSUES THAT THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE. I'M AS WELL AS ARE DRUG FREE BAY AREA WHICH MERRY ALSO TOUCHED ON AND WE HAVE SOME -- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING CARE THIS DRUG REBATES -- TOTAL ABOUT A BILLION AND A HALF GENERAL FUND A YEAR. AND THEY'RE REALLY DIFFICULT IN TERMS OF THE TIMING -- WHEN THEY COME IN AND SOMETIMES THEY JUST COME IN? AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO TO ACCOUNT FOR THEM. SO IN TERMS OF OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL WERE REQUESTING A TOTAL OF TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS -- TO STRENGTHEN OUR FISCAL MANAGEMENT AND CASH FLOW MONITORING AND THESE RESOURCES INCLUDING -- AN EXECUTIVE LEVEL POSITION TO SERVE AS THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER A SINGLE POINT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. AND TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A COMPLEX -- BUDGETING ACCOUNTING AND AND ESTIMATING PROCESSES MONITORING. AND WE'RE ALSO ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WITHIN OUR CENTRAL -- ESTIMATING BUDGETING AND ACCOUNTING SHOPS AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO PREPARE THE ESTIMATE DO THE ACCOUNTING DO THE BUDGETING FOR THE DEPARTMENT. EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT WERE REQUESTING A NUMBER OF POSITIONS -- TO SPREAD THROUGHOUT OUR PROGRAMS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE AS PART OF OUR OVERALL EFFORTS. IS TO ESTABLISH AND REINFORCE THE THE CONCEPT THAT FISCAL MANAGEMENT IS EVERYONE'S RESPONSIBILITY -- YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THE THE CENTRAL SERVICE FOLKS ONLY KNOW WHAT THEY KNOW SO YOU KNOW WE'RE PAYMENTS ARE MADE WERE DRUG REBATES ARE COMING IN THAT KIND OF THING IS HAPPENING ON THE PROGRAM SO WE'RE ASKING TO RESOURCE. THOSE AREAS AND WE THINK THESE RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY FOR THE IMMEDIATE WORKLOAD -- DEMANDS THAT WE HAVE WE ARE ALSO CONTINUING TO LOOK AT LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS IN TERMS OF SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS AND CHANGES. AND ENVISIONED WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THAT PROCESS -- IN ADDITION I MENTIONED WERE PROPOSING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH A MEDI CAL DRUG REBATE FUN AND IT REALLY WOULD SERVE AS A FISCAL MANAGEMENT TOOLS SO THAT WHEN WE GET THOSE -- REBATES INTO THE DEPARTMENT WERE BETTER ABLE TO MANAGE THE TIMING -- TO WHEN THEY OFFSET GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES. SO -- YOU HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- THAT ALL SPEAK -- TO JUST UNDERSCORE THAT THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAM COUPLED WITH EITHER -- INSUFFICIENT INADEQUATE OUTDATED SYSTEMS -- CREATE SIGNIFICANT SWINGS IN AND OR CANS CREATE SIGNIFICANT SWINGS IN IN THE ESTIMATE -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE REQUESTED RESOURCE IS REDUCE THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT AVOIDABLE ERRORS IN THE ESTIMATE -- BUT WE ARE WORKING TO ENHANCE PROCESS SEES AN ON A LONGER TERM BASIS THE SYSTEMS THAT WE USE TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OLEO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR RHYME WILL SEE WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- IN OUR VIEW THE THE SWINGS IN THE MEDICARE BUDGET THAT HAVE BEEN REFERENCED ARE SERIOUS CONCERN THAT -- MERIT SOME SOME ATTENTION FOR TWO REASONS NUMBER. ONE THE SWINGS ARE VERY LARGE AND THEY'VE BEEN IN BOTH DIRECTIONS IT WASN'T VERY MANY YEARS. BACK THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT UPWARD SWING IN -- ESTIMATED -- TO MEDI CAL SPENDING AND THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE LONG TERM PLANNING. AND SITS PRIORITIES CAN BE UPSET BY CHANGING BASELINE NEEDS IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM -- BUT BEYOND THAT AND AND WARRANTS -- CLOSE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT BUT THAT OVERSIGHT. IS MADE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAM -- OFTEN THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO ADEQUATELY -- TRACKING INDEPENDENTLY OVERSEE THE PROGRAM IS NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE -- AND IN SOME CASES IT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE -- IN LIGHT OF ALL OF THIS WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR STAFFING HAS MERIT AND WE RECKON RECOMMEND THAT IT BE APPROVED -- HOWEVER WE SUGGEST THAT INCREASED TRANSPARENCY FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL PRIORITY -- AS THIS PROPOSAL IS CONSIDERED -- IN THE SHORT TERM WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO SHARE KEY INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE GAINED. FROM THE APPROVAL OF THESE POSITIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE -- FOR EXAMPLE REGULAR UP UPDATES ON CASH FLOWS -- AND HOW THOSE COMPARE WITH -- BUDGET ESTIMATES SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE FIRST STEP THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE EXPLORED -- SECOND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS -- MENTIONED THAT THIS IS JUST THE FIRST STEP IN THAT THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL PLANNING ON ON LARGER MORE STRUCTURAL CHANGES OCCUR WE COULD BE MADE AND WE WE AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT. WE WOULD SUGGEST AND RECOMMEND THE WHERE THE DEPARTMENT TO COME FORWARD WITH A SPECIFIC PLAN. OF STEPS THAT COULD BE TAKEN IN THE FUTURE THIS WHAT ALLOWED LET'S LET LEGISLATURE TO BE INVOLVED -- INTO TO MAKE ITS PRIORITIES -- REFLECTED IN IN FUTURE CHANGES. ON THE PROPOSED DRUG REBATES SPECIAL FRONT FUND WE THINK THIS IS ALSO PROMISING CONCEPT -- THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE BROADER APPLICATION ANOTHER PORTIONS OF MEDI CAL BUDGET. AND RECOMMEND THAT THIS ALSO BE APPROVED [inaudible] THANK YOU. WITH THAT'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS FOR ANY QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE. SEEING NONE I DO WANT TO SAY THAT SINCE IT'S OUR FIRST HEARING I THINK I FORGOT PUBLIC COMMENT THE LAST ISSUE. SO IF THERE ARE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUES TWO OR THREE NOW WOULD BE THE TIME. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- WE'RE WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT THAT GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL INCLUDES US SUPPORT FOR HEALTH FOR ALL YOUNG ADULTS AND ALTHOUGH WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE COVERAGE FOR ALL -- ALL REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS A WELL AS FUNDING FOR THAT THE WHOLE PERSON HERE WE WE SUPPORT -- WE ALSO AGREE THE LA -- AND THE CHAIRS COMMENT REGARDING REVISITING LOOKING AT THE A MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAXES THAT BRINGS IN OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. US -- SOME OF WHICH COULD BE USED -- TO TO TO TO IMPROVE THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM INCLUDING HEALTH FOR ALL. EXPANDING -- ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT MEDI CAL AGING DISABLED PROGRAM AS WELL AS RESTORING CUTS. ON THAT HAVE. BEEN IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IN ADDITION -- IN REGARDS TO THE CHILLING EFFECT OF A PUBLIC CHARGE -- WE WOULD NOTE THAT -- A LONG TIME -- ENROLLMENT NUMBERS HAVE DIPPED BELOW THIRTEEN MILLION SOME OF THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO AN IMPROVING CON ECONOMY -- BUT CERTAINLY WE THINK SOME OF THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE CHILLING EFFECT OF OF PUBLIC CHARGES WE HAVE HEARD -- OF INDIVIDUALS DISTANT ROLLING -- TO TO ISSUE THREE WE WE DO SUPPORT -- DCS GETTING THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND IN TERMS OF THE FISCAL FORECASTING -- BUT SIMILAR TO THE LA -- I WOULD HAVE REQUEST ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY IN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THINKING BE GIVEN. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS LINDA TO NARROW ITS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK IN RESPONSE TO ISSUE -- TO ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THERE WASN'T. A MEDI CAL DENTAL SPECIFIC AGENDA ITEM -- WE JUST WANTED TO RAISE THE IMPORTANCE OF LANGUAGE ACCESS IN THE DENTAL PROGRAM -- FOR EXAMPLE YOU WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO SEE THE INVESTMENT IN ORAL HEALTH -- FOR EXAMPLE THE PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS -- TO IN ADDITION -- TO THE RESTORATION OF THE DENTAL BENEFITS HOWEVER WE CONTINUE TO ASSERT THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT PEOPLE ARE NOW ELIGIBLE -- FOR IN PARTICULAR WERE SEEN CONSUMERS REPORT DIFFICULTY ARE CONNECTING WITH PROVIDERS BECAUSE ARE UNWILLING OR ON ABLE TO PROVIDE LANGUAGE ACCESS SERVICES -- THERE BEEN ISSUES AROUND THE LANGUAGE ACCESS HOTLINE AS WELL -- WE'VE ALSO HEARD REPORTS OF CONSUMER IS SAYING THAT THERE ARE DOCUMENTS OF ONLY BEEN PRESENTED TO THEM IN ENGLISH -- SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH DH CS ON MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN ALLEVIATE THESE BARRIERS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN FULLY ENJOY -- THE TOTAL BENEFITS OF OF THEIR DENTAL CARE -- AND ALSO JUST TO REITERATE -- THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT WESTERN CENTER WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF HEALTH FOR ALL IN THE EXPANSION FOR THE ENTIRE ADULT POPULATION THINKING. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M FAIRLY DAY TING SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REPRESENTING ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES I JUST WANTED TO SAY WE WELCOME THIS COMMITTEE'S INTEREST IN THE MCO TAX RENEWAL. AS WELL AS THE MENTAL HEALTH POLICY CONVERSATION THANK YOU SO MUCH. WITH THE WE WILL HOLD ISSUE THREE OPEN BUT I WANTED TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE LA -- IF I CAN FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S -- WANTING AND HOPING FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY DURING THIS DISCUSSION AS WE GO FORWARD WITH THAT WILL MOVE TO ISSUE. FOR IF WE CAN MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE FOR JOHN BATTERS PLEASE A MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOHN VOTERS -- DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT CALIFORNIANS PERCEIVED INJUSTICE WAS ALSO SELECTED AS THE CHAIR TO REPORT OUT ON THE AB THREE FORTY WORKGROUP WHICH WE'RE HERE TO PRESENT TODAY WE WANT TO BEGIN BY. THANKING ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA -- FOR OFFERING THE LEGISLATION AB THREE FORTY A GROUP OF MEMBERS -- FROM AROUND CALIFORNIA WHO REPRESENTED COUNTY WELFARE AGENCIES COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES -- HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS CHILDREN'S ADVOCATES WELLNESS ADVOCATES AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY REFORM SYSTEM. WHEN I ALSO THINK THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR CONVENING THIS GROUP AND DIRECTOR CAN FOR HER WORK IN PARTNERSHIP IN HELPING US PREPARE -- TODAY'S REPORT. WHEN I WANT TO DO BASICALLY JUST COVER TWO THINGS ONE WAS THERE REPORTS HIGH FINDINGS -- HIGH LEVEL FINDINGS AT ONE END AND THAT THE OTHER END IS -- JUST A FOLLOW UP TO THOSE FINDINGS ON NEXT STEPS AND THINGS THAT THE COMMITTEE COULD CONSIDER GOING FORWARD. SO THE STATE WORK GROUP -- EXPLORED THE FOLLOWING TOPICS THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SCREENINGS AND ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE USED IN TRAUMA SERVICES THE VARIOUS TYPES OF EXPOSURES THAT -- TOOLS THEY'RE USED TO SCREEN KIDS AS WELL AS REVIEWING THE CURRENT TOOLS AT THE STATE PROGRAM UTILIZES. OUR VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS WERE GUIDED BY COMMON WORKPLACE -- WORKGROUP GOALS IN THE CRITERIA THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE WORK GROUP. WE BASICALLY WERE LOOKING FIRST DRAMA SCREENINGS THAT. COMPASS THE FOLLOWING THINGS VISIBILITY IN THE USE IN A PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE FOR US SETTING. ACCEPTANCE BY PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS FOR ITS UTILITY MEANING SCREENING COMPLETION SO IS THE CODE -- WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT -- INCLUSIVE AT A MINIMUM OF CATEGORIES OF TRAUMA AND EXPERIENCE THE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE CHILD ABUSE CHILD NEGLECT HOUSEHOLD DYSFUNCTION ANOTHER POTENTIALLY DRAMATIC EVENTS. THAT ARE DETRIMENTAL TO SOCIAL HEALTH INCLUDING MAJOR STRESSFUL EVENTS COMMUNITY VIOLENCE DISCRIMINATION AND POVERTY. THE GROUP RECOMMENDS THREE THINGS IN PARTICULAR FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK ON THAT WOULD ALLOW MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO BE GIVEN OPTIONS AND INSURING THAT TRAUMA SCREENINGS ARE IMPROVING CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST IS THAT WE ASK AND RECOMMEND THAT THE BAY AREA RESEARCH CONSORTIUM AND TOXIC STRESS AND HEALTH SCREENING TOOL NOTICE PEARLS. IS USE ALONGSIDE THE STATE REQUIRED -- STAYING HEALTHY ASSESSMENT WHICH WE CALL THE SHOTS. BRIGHT FUTURES OR ANY OTHER APPROVED BY CUBA FOR THE PURPOSES OF IMPROVING SCREENING TOOLS FOR TRAUMA IN CHILDREN IN EXAMINING THE FORMAL INTEGRATION OF THAT TOOL WITH THE SHOW ON THE FUTURE. SECOND RECOMMEND THAT THE USE OF THE WHOLE CHILD ASSESSMENT TOOL WHICH IS AN EXISTING STATE HE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE INCORPORATES -- SCREENING FOR EXPOSURE TRUMP ALONGSIDE OTHER IMPORTANT VARIABLES IN FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE SOCIAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CHILDREN. FINALLY WE CONTINUE -- TO RECOMMEND THAT THE REQUEST FOR APPROVAL FROM DH CS FOR THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE TOOLS THAT ARE CONSISTENT AT A MINIMUM WITH THE GUIDELINES AND QUESTIONS -- UTILIZED BY THE PROS TO WILL BE AVAILABLE -- TO PROVIDERS IN THE FUTURE -- WE RECOMMEND FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PEARLS TO IN PARTICULAR THAT THERE BE A TO PART ASSESSMENT FIRST IS THE IMMEDIATE -- IMPLEMENTATION OF PEARLS ALONGSIDE THE THE SHOT AS I MENTIONED -- THE THE PROS TOOL -- FOCUSES SPECIFICALLY ON ASK QUESTIONS OF PARENTS OR CHILDREN AS AGE APPROPRIATE. TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS ARE ACES THE KIDS SPACE THAT COULD BECOME PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH -- IMPEDIMENTS TO THE DEVELOPMENT EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT OF A CHILD -- SECOND WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT EXPLORE -- THE POTENTIAL OF INTEGRATING THE THE PEARLS TO OR QUESTIONS THAT OUR CORPORATE IN THE POOR PEARL STILL INTO THE SHOP. SO WE HAVE AN INTEGRATED FOOTBALL UNIFORMS TO ON THE STATE -- THIS WOULD REQUIRE THIS COMMITTEE IN THE STATE -- DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW THE COST AND VALIDATION PROCESS FOR MAKING THAT POSSIBLE AND WE THINK THAT'S A WORTHWHILE -- ENDEAVOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT ENGAGING -- THE COINCIDING WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROS TO WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CONSIDER COMPLIANCE MONITORING -- SPECIFICALLY THE USE OF A DESIGNATED CPT CODE -- COUPLED WITH SOME PROVIDER TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT THE SUCCESS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF TRAUMA SCREENING IS UNIVERSAL ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS THERE ARE SOME DISCREPANCIES AT COUNTY ADMINISTRATION LEVEL TODAY. FINALLY WE HAD MULTIPLE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SCREENING -- FOR ACES IN ADULTS -- AND THE INTER GENERATIONAL IMPACT ON THE TRUMP HAS AYE KIDS IN THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF THAT SO WE THINK THAT THE NEXT STEP THAT THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE COULD UNDERTAKE. IS TO ALSO EXAMINE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF CHILDREN. AB THREE FORTY THE POTENTIAL FOR DOING TRAUMA SCREENINGS IN ADULTS. FOLLOWING UP TO THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A FEW OTHER IDEAS FOR YOU -- BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS ON THE EP STT BENEFIT -- WE COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH DOCTORS MISS OPENING COMMENTS ON THE STATE OF THE STATE OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO EXTREMELY BROAD BENEFIT I'M WORKING ON INTERVENTIONS FOR TRAUMA FORCES THE OPPORTUNITY IN GREAT PHYSICAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENTS OF HEALTH CARE TO PROVIDE BETTER PUBLIC HEALTH REALISTICALLY IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE IMPROVE DRAMA SCREENINGS ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN ARE PROVIDERS WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER PREDICT MONITOR AND THEN PROVIDE TREATMENT FOR THE MANIFESTATIONS OF TRAUMA DIFFERENT LEVELS IN PLACES ACROSS THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. ONE OF THE KEY NEXT STEPS THAT WE BELIEVE IS IMPRISONMENT IMPROVING THIS PROCESS IS TO MAKE SURE THE PROVIDERS ARE WELL TRAINED ON FROM THE SCREENINGS. THIS CAN INCLUDE HOW TO PROVIDE FROM IN FRONT CARE WHEN THEY'RE ADMINISTERING SCREENINGS HOW TO ENGAGE WITH PATIENCE WITH EXPERIENCE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. AND WHAT THE WHAT THE APPROPRIATE REFERRALS OR INTERVENTIONS MIGHT BE TO HELP ADDRESS CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. ADDITIONALLY ADVOCATES RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE EXPOSED THE POTENTIAL OR EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL NEXT STEPS WHEN IT COMES TO EXPANDING THE ACTUAL SERVICES THE TRAUMA VICTIMS RECEIVE. THIS WOULD REQUIRE -- DIFFERENT BY ARE THE VARIABLES THAT IMPACT -- PEOPLE HOW THEY OVERCOME THOSE TYPES OF EVENTS IN THEIR LIFE COMMON CATEGORIES THAT INCLUDE EXERCISE NUTRITION SLEEP MINDFULNESS MENTAL HEALTH CARE -- INTERVENTIONS THE FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES WILL HAVE A NET POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE TYPES OF STRESS THAT AFFECT CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS AND IMPROVE OUR OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH AND RESULTING -- RESULTING CARE COUPLE OF FINAL EXAMPLES OF WAYS THIS COULD BE DONE WE ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY -- WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT YOU YOU COULD CONSIDER WAYS TO PILOT THINGS LIKE TRAUMA INFORMED ABOUT PARENTING SUPPORT MODELS. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- SERVICES SPECIFICALLY FOR CHILDREN PARENTS INCLUDING INFANT EARLY CHILD MENTAL HEALTH AND DYADIC MODELS -- WHERE THERE'S INTEGRATED PRIMARY CARE CO LOCATED OR COMMUNITY BASED -- CARE COORDINATION SYSTEM NAVIGATION AND THEIR SEVERAL STUDIES THAT THE NEW SURGEON GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA PARTICIPATED IN AS A MEMBER OF THE CENTER AND USE WHILE THIS BACK IN THE DAY -- THIS EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPROVING SOCIAL HEALTH FOR CHILDREN WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING INCLUDING HOME VISITATION PROGRAMS -- YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS -- MISTER CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE'S INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE IN YOUR PRIORITIZATION MENTAL HEALTH IN HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. DIRECTOR CAN SURE THANK YOU -- SO I WOULD SAY THAT THE WORK GROUP THAT -- WE CONVENE SO -- TOGETHER WAS ACTUALLY REALLY IN THE CONVERSATION AND QUITE HELPFUL IN HELPING THINK THROUGH -- SOME OF THE ISSUES SURROUNDING -- TRAUMA SCREENS IN THE IN THE POPULATION YOU KNOW I THINK -- I HAVE I HAVE TOLD PEOPLE THAT ONE OF THE MORE NOTABLE -- COMMENTS FROM ONE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH -- DIRECTORS -- FROM SHASTA COUNTY WAS THE RECOGNITION THAT -- A LOT OF THE ADULT POPULATION OF THEIR THAT THEY HAVE FOUND -- IT'S AN ENERGY IT'S A IT'S A GENERATIONAL THING AND YOU CAN'T ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF CHILDREN BEING IMPACTED UNLESS YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE ADULTS I THINK THAT. SOME OF THE NATURE OF THAT -- IMPORTANCE WAS -- CARRIED FORWARD IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL SO WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT IT BOTH TODAY AS WELL AS IN MENTAL HEALTH -- DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE BEING -- HEARD -- TO MISSION AND THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE TO DO TRAUMA SCREENINGS FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS POPULATIONS -- I THINK IS INDICATIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTEREST IN GETTING -- TO NOT ONLY DOING THE SCREEN BUT THE BROADER CONVERSATION IS IS ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THE SCREENING -- WHAT ARE THE SERVICES AND OTHER OPTIONS THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE KIND OF -- DOING A LOT MORE EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AS YOU NOTED EARLIER -- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT -- AGAIN I'M KIND OF GETTING INTO THE PROP FIFTY SIX AGENDA ITEM BEFORE WE GET THEIR OFFICIALLY IS THAT THE VALUE BASED PURCHASING PROPOSAL THAT IS IN THE GOVERNOR'S -- BUDGET ALSO CONTAINS -- IDEAS AND INCENTIVES AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS AND SO I THINK WE ARE SAYING THAT -- THE TRAUMA SCREENS ARE AN IMPORTANT FIRST COMPONENT BUT I THINK AS MR BATRES IS CERTAINLY INDICATED IS THAT ONCE A PERSON ADMITS. ON A SCREENING TOOL THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO QUESTION IS AS WELL WHAT DO I DO WITH THAT PERSON AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND SO I THINK THAT IS OF A POLICY DISCUSSION THAT WE AS A STATE HAVE TO HAVE IN TERMS OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO CERTAINLY HAPPY TO BE A PART OF THAT BUT REALLY WANTED TO SAY THAT THE WORKGROUP WAS DOES -- ILLUSTRATIVE AND VERY POSITIVE IN COLLABORATIVE AND I THINK THAT WE WERE -- WITH PLEASE WITH THE OUTCOME OF THAT [inaudible] LET'S SEE. I'M. WITH THAT WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DIES FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE. XENON I'LL JUST SAY IT'S NICE TO ACTUALLY HAVE YOU WELCOME AND BECOME A BELIEVER IN A SAYS I THINK. SOMETIMES A NEVER MY YEAH. I DON'T THINK YOU WERE -- NOT THERE BUT NOW THAT WE ARE ALL ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION IS QUITE NICE. WANTED TO REALLY TALK IF I COULD ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND CRITICAL NATURE OF THE C. P. T. CODE THE FIGHT COULD FOR COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO TRACKING TREND UNLESS WE HAVE THAT CPT CODE AND WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THIS ADMINISTRATION TO WORK ON THAT WHEN. I MET WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL -- EARLIER THIS MONTH THAT WAS THE THING SHE BROUGHT UP TO ME. ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS AND JUST WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH THAT WORKING TOGETHER -- WITH THAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT BEFORE US AND WE WILL NOW HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE. FOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RIGHT MAKE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AS A MEMBER OF THE WORKING GROUP -- I CONCUR WITH WHAT MR BATTER SAID RUEFULLY IN SUPPORT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- AND ALSO FULLY IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGETS -- INCLUSION OF FUNDING FOR TRAUMA SCREENINGS FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS LIKE TO THANK YOU AND DIRECTOR CAN'T -- FOR ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE A REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT STEPS. MICHELLE GIVENS OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE GOING FOR IT BUT EVEN FURTHER WE WERE HAPPY. AND TO HAVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE AND NOT LANDS -- INCLUDED IN THE WORK GROUP ACTIVITIES AND SHOULD THIS CONVERSATION SHIFT TO WHAT COMES NEXT -- OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT STAND READY TO BE A PART OF THAT CONVERSATION THINK YOU. HI SERRA MARKS WITH THE CENTER FOR YOUTH WELLNESS AND A MEMBER OF THE AB THREE FORTY WORK GROUP -- I ALSO WORK WITH THE NATIONAL NETWORK OF PEDIATRIC MEDICAL PROVIDERS WORKING ON THIS ISSUE SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS I FULLY SUPPORT -- HOW MISTER OUT OF PRISON AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING PUT TOWARDS TRAINING AND THE ALIGNMENT OF SERVICES BASED ON THE SCREENING WHICH ARE GONNA BE IN CENTRAL -- FOR US USING THIS MONEY WISELY AS WE MOVE FORWARD INSURING THAT THESE PROVIDERS CAN DO WHAT WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. HI THERE -- OF FROM A TEST FIVE WITH CENTER FOR YOUTH WELLNESS AS WELL US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN COUNTER TOLD TO DOT FOR CITY FOR CA. AND TODAY WE'RE HERE TO SAY WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU'VE PUT FORTH -- AND ALSO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT THE PROPER WAYS WE CAN PROVIDE PROVIDER TRAINING AS WELL NOT SURE THAT THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE -- CAN BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE CHILDREN FAMILIES WITH THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DíAS I I HAVE A FEELING YOU MIGHT HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT PROVIDER TRAINING LATER ON IN THIS YEAR BUT WE WANT TO TRUST THAT IN THIS FORM. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FOR OPEN IN THE BOND ISSUE FIVE GREAT SO ON ISSUE FIVE AS IT PERTAINS TO PROPOSITION -- FIFTY SIX JUST -- TO NOTE THAT WE'RE HEADING INTO THE THIRD FISCAL YEAR IN WHICH PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE -- AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN JANUARY WE ARE PROPOSING TO CONTINUE THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND THE PHYSICIAN -- AREA FOR BOTH MANAGED CARE AND FEE FOR CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WAS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN FISCAL YEAR -- EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WERE PROJECTING THAT THIS WILL EQUAL APPROXIMATELY -- ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO PHYSICIANS UNDER THIS PROPOSAL -- THE DENTAL SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ALSO REMAIN THE SAME WE PROJECT THIS TO BE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR DENTAL -- THE ADDITIONAL -- PAYMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN TERMS OF WOMEN'S HEALTH -- FOR BOTH F. PACKED AS WELL AS AN MEDI CAL -- THERE -- TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATIONS ONE IS BEING CONTINUED IN THE F. PACKED PROGRAM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CALLS FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION FOR THE SAME FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES. BUT IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM F. PASSED AS A SEPARATE PROGRAM THAT IS NOT MEDI CAL -- ALL OF THE PAYMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR HOME HEALTH PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH SERVICES AIDS WAIVER SERVICES AND I SEE FTD PROVIDERS ALSO CONTINUE -- WHAT'S NOTABLE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT ARE NEW ITEMS -- REFLECT THE TRAUMA SCREENS THAT WE JUST -- DISCUSS FOR BOTH ADULTS AND FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AS IT PERTAINS TO DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS -- THESE ARE FOR BOTH MANAGE CARE AND FEE FOR SERVICE AND THEN -- AS I ALSO REFERENCE THERE'S A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IDENTIFIED FOR VALUE BASED PURCHASING -- INCENTIVES -- IN KEY AREAS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED -- IN WHICH WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE PROVIDERS -- EARN INCENTIVES THROUGH INCREASED QUALITY SCORES AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT PRE AND POSTNATAL CARE AND WE WILL BE -- WORKING ON ONE'S ON KIND OF VACCINATION EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS OF THE ADMINISTRATION FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD. MORE BROADLY AND THEN -- NOTABLE AND WE WERE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS AS WELL BUT WE STILL CONTINUE TO BE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AS IT PERTAINS TO LOAN REPAYMENT FOR BOTH PHYSICIAN AND DENTAL PROVIDERS -- WE HAVE ENGAGE WITH PHYSICIANS FOR A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA TO ADMINISTER THAT APPLICATION PROCESS AND OVERSIGHT OF THE OF THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM FOR THOSE PROVIDERS -- SO HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE -- A NOTE OF KIND OF PIPELINE OR MEDI CAL PROVIDERS EARLY AS THEY GRADUATE OR FINISH THEIR RESIDENT SEES -- PUT THEM INTO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AND THEN DO LOAN FORGIVENESS AS A WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE. COMMITTED TO THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO -- TAKING ONE OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS THAT A PROVIDER FACES AS SOON AS THEY GRADUATE IN TERMS OF WHERE DO THEY PRACTICE AND AND WHAT WHAT KIND OF CARE DO THEY PROVIDE IN TERMS OF CARE SOURCE. AND WE'RE TRYING TO KIND OF GUARANTEE THAT THEY ARE -- EMBEDDED IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AND AND CERTAINLY ABLE TO STAY WITH US -- FOR THE LONG HAUL SO -- THERE IS A B. C. P. THAT I WILL JUST QUICKLY REFERENCE WHERE WE ARE SEEKING EIGHTEEN POSITIONS. AND APART AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS -- ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS AND ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS. TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE NEW -- VALUE BASED PURCHASING -- INITIATIVE THIS IS A LOT MORE -- INTENSIVE A FEW TEENS TO SETTING UP THE METRICS -- THAT THE PLANS WILL BE WORKING WITH PROVIDERS ON AN INDIVIDUALIZED BASIS AS WELL AS DOING THE OVERSIGHT AND THE ACTUAL IN SOME OF THESE ARE NOT ONE YEAR. KIND OF SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS WHERE WE HAVE JUST -- TRADITIONALLY ATTACHED A DOLLAR AMOUNT TO A CODE SUCH THAT IF A PROVIDER BILL TO CERTAIN CPT CODE IT THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED AN ADDITIONAL DOLLAR AMOUNT -- VALUE BASED PURCHASING IS A LOT MORE TIME INTENSIVE BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE MUCH MORE GRANULAR LEVEL IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE QUALITY. SCORES AND WHAT'S THE IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME IN THOSE PROVIDERS AND HOW DO WE PROVIDE THOSE INCENTIVES AND SO. CERTAINLY WE NEED THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES INTERNALLY IN ORDER TO KIND OF DO THAT IN A LONG TERM BASIS AND COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH. THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS ON HOW THOSE ARE GOING TO BE DESIGNED IN THE METHODOLOGY IN THE FUNDING AND DOLLAR AMOUNTS ARE CERTAINLY -- DETAILS THAT WERE GOING TO BE WORKING ON THROUGH THIS BUDGET PROCESS SO HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. ANY COMMENTS BERMAN FINANCE EARLIER. I JUST THINK IT'S DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL ALLOW THE LA A COMMENT AND WE MAY I RESPOND SHOULD THAT BE NECESSARY THANK YOU. HI BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- ON FRIDAY WE RELEASED AN ANALYSIS OF THE USE OF PROPOSITION -- FIFTY SIX FUNDING IN MEDI CAL TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE -- THE REPORT REALLY FOCUSES I THINK ON BOTH THE NEW PER -- BY THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS ON THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES UP OF NO PAYMENTS AS THEY SORT OF INTERACT WITH MANAGED CARE WE FOCUS ON ON THOSE PAYMENTS BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF BENEFICIARIES GATE GET THEIR CARE THROUGH. MANAGED CARE AND IT HAS THE THE CLOSEST NEXUS OF SORT OF A SORT OF A INTERACTION. WHAT WE DO WHAT WE FELT WE WE BREAK OUR REPORT DOWN INTO KIND OF TWO DIFFERENT PARTS ONE IS ASSESSING HOW PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT WORKS WITHIN MANAGE CARE AND SORT OF HOW? PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX PAYMENTS LATER ON TO THAT. AND WE ALSO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF HOW ACCESS AND QUALITY -- ARE MEASURED WITHIN MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE AND THEN FINALLY WE TRY TO BRING THOSE TWO TOGETHER TO ASSESS -- THE APPROPRIATENESS OR THAT THE SORT OF THE THE PROMISE OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR PHYSICIAN PAYMENTS -- IN IMPROVING THAT QUALITY SO. FIRST WE FIND THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS DO HAVE FLEXIBILITY. TO SET PROVIDER PAYMENTS -- ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN LOCAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND NEEDS -- THEY GET FUNDING THROUGH CAPITATED AND THEN THEY CAN SET THEIR PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS -- ACCORDINGLY -- ON THE ACCESS AND QUALITY. SIDE WE FIND THAT OVERALL THERE AND THERE'S NO -- SORT OF WIDESPREAD EVIDENCE OF NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE'S ACCESSING QUALITY STANDARDS -- GENERALLY THE MANAGED CARE PLANS DO MEET THE TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS THAT THE STATE HAS -- BEEN IMPOSING IN RECENT YEARS -- BUT WE DO FIND THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE WHILE MANAGED CARE PLANS SEEM TO PHASE RELATIVELY -- A LESSER AMOUNT OF DIFFICULTY FOR EXAMPLE RECRUITING PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THEY DO FACE GREATER CHALLENGES IN RECRUITING -- SPECIALIST PRIMARILY -- PEDIATRIC SPECIALIST IN LOCATIONS THAT ARE CLOSE TO WHERE THEIR MEMBERS ULTIMATELY LEFT. WE ALSO FIND THAT THERE'S A LARGE VERY BILL COMMENTS ON THE QUALITY METRICS THAT THE STATE -- THAT THE STATE IMPOSES AS WELL AS GENERAL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT ON IN TERMS OF MEMBER SATISFACTION WITH THE CARE THAT THEY RECEIVE THROUGH -- THROUGH THEIR MANAGED CARE PLANS. TURNING TO THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX SIDE WE FIND THAT THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES REALLY APPLY A UNIFORM AND STATEWIDE -- SOLUTION TO POTENTIAL DEFICIENCIES IN ACCESSING QUALITY THAT REALLY VERY -- BY MANAGED CARE PLAN AND IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE. SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT THE EXISTING APPROACH IS SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE TO MEET THOSE VERY ABLE -- HEALTH CARE NEEDS -- MOREOVER WE FIND THAT THE EXISTING SO -- SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. GENERALLY TARGET NON SPECIALTY SERVICES WHEREAS IN OUR PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF WHERE THERE IS -- SAY WHERE BENEFICIARIES I'M TO SEE A THAT THAT HE CONCENTRATED IN VERY SPECIALTIES. ULTIMATELY WE WE RAISE CONCERNS THAT THE GOVERNOR STATES AND INTEND TO MAKE THE EXISTING PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES -- PERMANENT DESPITE NOT HAVING RELEASED AN EVALUATION SHOWING THEIR IMPACT ON ACCESS AND QUALITY IN INITIAL CONVERSATIONS AND AND DEBATE OVER -- OVER HOW TO USE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING -- WE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A THERE WAS A COMMITMENT TO PERFORMING THAT ANALYSIS AND WE'D WANT TO SEE THAT -- SEE THAT ANALYSIS BEFORE THEY ARE MADE PERMANENT. FINALLY NOTE THAT GIVEN PROJECTED REVENUES AND THE PROPOSED LEVEL OF SPENDING UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- WE WE DO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX USING ONLY PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING -- THE LEVEL PROPOSED IN -- TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY IT BY A SMALL AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX THAT'S DEDICATED. TO MEDI CAL AND WE WOULD EXPECT THIS TO BE A DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE GOING FORWARD SO THERE COULD BE -- THERE COULD BE NEED IF WE KEPT IF THINGS WERE -- IF IT WERE JUST HELD FORWARD AND AND SUSTAINED IN TERMS OF THE PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES THERE COULD BE NEED FOR SOME GENERAL FUND. OVERALL WE JUST WE PROVIDE SEVERAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION AND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS -- WHAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE EXISTING PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES SHOULD BE FURTHER ASSESSED BEFORE THEY ARE MADE PERMANENT AND RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT H. YES TO REPRODUCE SO PRO REPORT ON THEIR IMPACTS AND -- IMPACT ON ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE FIND THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER -- THE GOVERNOR'S VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROPOSAL AS WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT DOES TARGET AREAS WITH SOME DEFICIENCIES IN MEDI CAL AND WE FIND THAT PAYING FOR OUTCOMES AS OPPOSED -- TO SERVICE UTILIZATION -- IS A PROMISING APPROACH -- TO IMPROVING CARE WITHIN MEDI CAL IN SO FAR AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS -- APPROVED WE DO THINK THAT THE STATE OPERATIONS RESOURCES WOULD BE -- WOULD BE APPROPRIATE -- THAT SAID WE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL ON THE NEW PROPOSED PAYMENTS AND SO WE'D BE LOOKING FORWARD -- TO SOME OF THAT ADDITIONAL DETAIL AS THE BUDGET PROCESS CONTINUES. FINALLY WE WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTION OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS -- THAT THE IDENTIFICATION TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUAL OF CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS IS A WORTHY GOAL WE DO NT BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A COST EFFECTIVE. APPROACH TO SOLVING THIS ISSUE -- DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED WITHIN MEDI CAL AND FUNDED THROUGH MANAGED CARE AS WELL AS FEE FOR SERVICE AND WE DO THINK THAT OTHER COST EFFECTIVE APPROACHES SUCH AS IMPROVING THE STATE'S ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING REQUIREMENTS. AS WELL AS OTHER POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS SHOULD BE TRIED BEFORE PROVIDING THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO -- THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BY ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WITHOUT A BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE AGENCY'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ID POPULATION. WITH THE MANAGED CARE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PROVIDERS THAT ARE OF? SUPPLY TO SAY A FAMILY. AND NOW THERE'S OVER YEAR WAITING PERIOD FOR PROVIDERS WHAT CAN THE AGENCY DO. IS A RESPONSIBLE. STEWARD OF THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THESE FAMILIES ARE GETTING. NOT DELAYED CARE. FOR THEIR CHILD WHO LOSES THAT YEAR OR OR LONGER. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BEST VALUE? I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS AS IT IS AND THAT'S THE FOR THE FALL BACK ON SOME OF THE MANAGED CARE SYSTEMS OR SAY. WE CAN GET YOU THE SERVICES THAT YOU DESERVE OUR NY. WHAT CAN YOU DO IS AN AGENCY? TO MAKE THAT AN EFFECTIVE. VALUE FOR THAT FAMILY. SURE I THINK -- AS AS I REFERENCED EARLIER ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS THIS IS A REQUIREMENT THAT -- PROVIDERS ARE SCREEN ALL KIDS AT CERTAIN -- PERIODICITY SCHEDULES WITH AND YOU KNOW WHEN A PARENT BRINGS A CHILD AND THERE'S CERTAIN TIMES IN WHICH THEY ARE SCREENING FOR CERTAIN ITEMS -- IT IS OUR THAT DOING DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TO IDENTIFYING AND DOING AS MUCH PREVENTION -- AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THEN OBVIOUSLY IF THE SCREENS AREN'T DONE THEN THE CHILD MAY LOSE A YEAR OR ARE LONGER IF THEY'RE NOT APPROPRIATE IDENTIFIED. ON THAT. THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN OUR PROGRAM -- AND WHAT WE PROVIDE FROM A MEDICAL -- HEALTH CARE STANDPOINT AND THEN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN US AND THEM THAT -- DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES -- DEPARTMENT -- AND THE REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES OUR PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER SUCH THAT IF A CHILD IS IDENTIFIED BY A PEDIATRICIAN OR CLINIC THAT THEY MAY HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS. THERE'S FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC TESTING THAT OCCURS AND THEN IF THE CHILD IS FOUND TO HAVE A NEED FOR SERVICES -- THEY ARE REFERRED OVER TO THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT -- AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THE REGIONAL SOME I AM TO WORK AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE WITH OUR SISTER DEPARTMENT -- AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE REQUIRE OUR PLANS TO WORK WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS IN TERMS OF HOW THAT RELATIONSHIP IN THOSE REFERRAL PATTERNS GO. TO FULLY BELIEVE THERE'S THERE'S PLENTY OF PROFESSIONALS. THAT ARE ABLE TO ASSASSIN AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHILD. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THE FIELD TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS SO WE'VE GOT. BUKU. OF PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SPEECH PATHOLOGISTS AND WE CAN ASSESS THIS CHILD TILL THE DAY IS LONG. BUT WE DON'T PROVIDE THEM THE FIXTURES NO DIRECT SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THAT CHILD ONCE THE ASSESSMENTS BEEN MADE WE DON'T HAVE. AND SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO EITHER CREATE CREATE CREATE OF CAREER PASS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS FOR THE PROVIDERS OR AN INCENTIVE TO BE A PROVIDER. BECAUSE AND NOW THE MEMBERS OF THE FREE STUDY SUPPOSED TO BE ROLLED OUT TODAY. BUT YOU LOOK AT IN HISTORICALLY. WE HAVE NOT ACCOMPLISHED. ANYTHING THE LETTERMAN ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT PROVIDING A DIRECT SERVICE WHEN PEOPLE ARE WAITING A YEAR. FOR BEHAVIORAL OR OR ONE ONE CARE OR ANY THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD BE AFFORDED. OF GOING FORWARD AND THAT'S CRIMINAL WE NEED TO LOOK AT YOUR AGENCY TO BE ABLE TO STEP ON MAKE MENTION HEALTH CARE OR A RECOMMENDATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROVIDERS AND THE CAREER PROFESSIONALS IN BECAUSE THAT THERE'S A DEFICIENCY WE HAVE ENOUGH PROFESSIONALS WE DON'T HAVE THE DOERS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER -- WE HAVE -- REPORT ALSO COMING OUT LATER THIS WEEK THAT IS GONNA IDENTIFY SOME OF THE BROADER CHALLENGES IN SURVEYING -- CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS -- THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON ONE APPROACH BUT WE WE SORT OF VALUE EIGHT AND SIX AND STATE THAT BROADER -- REFORM IS POTENTIALLY NECESSARY TO BE CHANGED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE SERVING -- ALL CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT. AND NOT TO MIX ISSUES BUT I BELIEVE FULL ADDRESS MOST OF THESE ON THE MARCH SIXTH HEARING NEXT WEDNESDAY WHEN WE CAN. TALK ABOUT THE RATE STUDY IN THE FOLLOW UP THE YOU ARE. MENTIONING TODAY BUT REALLY TODAY'S ABOUT PROP FIFTY SIX AND JUST WANTED TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE ON THE DIES AT OTHER COMMENTS OR IF YOU WANT TO FINISH YOUR THOUGHT OF SOMETHING FRAZIER. JUST PRELUDE TO THE NEXT. I I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TESTIFYING [inaudible] NO ACTUALLY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON PANEL. ONE I JUST THINK AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- I'LL JUST BRIEFLY SAID THINK THESE ELLIE -- FOR THEIR COMMENTS BUT I WOULD LIKE. TO BRIEFLY MENTION ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS OF COURSE WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT. THE FUNDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR PROVIDERS FOR PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS IN THE TERMS THAT IT JUST FOR THE INTENT ALSO EXPANDING QUALITY -- WE BELIEVE IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE SUPPLEMENTS PAYMENTS AS WELL WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION -- TO COMMENT ON THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE FUND -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A BALANCED -- BUDGET WE INCLUDE A BALANCED I WITHIN THE REVENUE FORECASTS THAT WE HAVE FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS. COURSE ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS AS WE DO I KNOW ELLIE IS CONCERNED THAT IT IS A DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE WE WILL BE EVALUATING ON A YEAR BY YEAR IN CASE BY CASE BASIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PRESENT A BALANCED BUDGET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I SHARE THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT A DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM PERMANENT AND YET I'LL PROBABLY JUST AGREE WITH YOU THAT I THINK MAKING THEM PERMANENT. ALLOWS FOR THE STABILITY AND FOR THE PROVIDERS TO MAKE THE CHANGES TO THEIR PRACTICE -- IN SO I SEE THE BENEFIT ON BOTH SIDES BUT DO APPRECIATE YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD PANEL ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON THE PANEL TO WHEN HE SAID TOSS THE STEVE HORN AND MICHELLE NIGHT OF OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANNA THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF -- FOR ALLOWING US -- TO COMING PRESENT OUR CASE AT THIS POINT -- ON THE MEDI CAL RATES -- MY NAME IS DEBBIE TOTH AND I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF CHOICE AN AGING -- WE ARE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION IT'S BASED IN CONTRA COSTA BUT WE SERVE CONTRA COSTA SOLANO NAPA AND SACRAMENTO COUNTIES -- I'M HERE ACTUALLY TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FOR ASSOCIATE ASSOCIATION FOR ADULT DAY SERVICES ALSO KNOWN AS CABS IT IS ALSO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. AND IT'S BEEN -- SUPPORTING ADVANCING IN LEADING ADULT DAY SERVICES SINCE. NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW I'M GONNA FIRST PAINT A PICTURE SORT OF OF WHO WE ARE WHAT ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE IS. I'M GONNA TALK TO ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND THEN I'M GONNA MAKE AN ASK THAT I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET -- SO ADULT DAY HEALTH CENTERS ARE THINK ABOUT FOLKS WHO CAN NO LONGER ATTEND A SENIOR CENTER INDEPENDENTLY. AND THE BABY SOME ASSISTANCE GOING TO THE REST DISSIPATING ACTIVITIES -- AND MATCH THAT WITH THE STAFFING IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. SO MEDICAL DIRECTOR PHARMACY CONSUL THANK CONSOLE NURSES SOCIAL WORKERS PHYSICAL THERAPY SPEECH THERAPY OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY BLAH BLAH BLAH I COULD GO ON RIGHT SO ALL OF THAT STAFFING AND THE WHOLE IDEA IS WE KEEP THESE FOLKS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE. IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES LIVING INDEPENDENTLY IN THE COMMUNITY WITH DIGNITY -- SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME OUR ORGANIZATION HAD THE SIXTEENTH LICENSED ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE FACILITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN THERE SEVENTEEN YEARS PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES -- AND WE SUPPORT THAT POPULATION WHICH YOU HEAR ABOUT CMS CENTERS FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES TALK ABOUT THAT THERE IS 5% OF THE MEDICAID SPEND. 5% OF THE POPULATION THAT IS 50% OF THE MEDICAID SPEND WE HEAR ABOUT THAT THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE SERVE AN ADULT DAY HEALTH CENTERS -- WE ARE RECOGNIZED AS BEING ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST VALUABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND YET. WE HAVE NOT HAD A RATE INCREASE IN ELEVEN YEARS. I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT THINKING THROUGH THAT IN JUST A MOMENT. FIRST THE REQUEST WE WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST A RESTORATION OF AB I'M THAT WOULD PUT US UP TO CURRENT RATES. WHICH HER WOEFULLY INADEQUATE AND WE'LL GET INTO THAT FIFTY SEVEN CENTERS HAS HAVE CLOSED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND SOME OF THEM IN FRESNO IN SOME OF THEM IN MENDOCINO AND SOME OF THEM IN. MEMBER AREAS HERE -- AND YOU'VE LOST THAT FOREVER BECAUSE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO REBUILD IS HUGELY EXPENSIVE AND COST PROHIBITIVE. TODAY WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT CENTERS COME WHEN WE HAD THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX CENTERS -- JUST TO GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IN HOME CARE YOU CAN PAY FOR A PRIVATE CARE NON SKILLED PERSON TO COME IN AND HELP SOMEBODY IN THE HOME. FOR TWENTY FIVE THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. WITH THE CURRENT MEDI CAL RATE FOR ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE. IT'S THE REIMBURSEMENT IS LESS THAN SEVENTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR. WITH THAT SKILLED STAFFING I TALK TO YOU ABOUT. NOW PAINTING THE PICTURE IMAGINE THAT WE HAVE TO HIRE NURSES AND PHYSICAL THERAPISTS AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS. ARE REGULATIONS GET. MORE HEAVY THE ACUITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE SERVING GOES UP WHEN I STARTED WE HAD A THREE PAGE. INDIVIDUAL PLAN OF CARE WE NOW HAVE AN EIGHTEEN PAGE INDIVIDUAL PLAN OF CARE. SO ARE BURDEN INCREASES. THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION HAS DOUBLED SINCE I STARTED THE COST OF A MEAL ALL OF THOSE THINGS WE HAVE TO PAY FOR WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE IT'S REGULATORY -- REQUIREMENT. SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IN ADDITION TO RESTORING THAT RATE IS A 15% COST OF LIVING INCREASE TO THE PUBLISHED MEDI CAL RATE. TO TAKE INTO. ACCOUNT MORE THAN A DECADE WORST OF THOSE COSTS AM FOR PERSPECTIVE ACCESS IS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE STATEWIDE WE HAVE THIRTY TWO COUNTIES WITH NO CENTERS AT A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THIRTY TWO WITH NO. CENTERS -- WE HAVE -- EIGHT AND EIGHTEEN COUNTIES WITH SIX OR FEWER CENTERS. I'M I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I KNOW THAT MY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER RECOGNIZED AS WE HAVE THIS MASSIVE GROWING AGING DEMOGRAPHIC IN IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY THE EIGHTY FIVE AN OLDER POPULATION BY TWENTY SIXTY ACCORDING TO YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS GOING TO GROW. BY TWO HUNDRED AND 99%. THE STATE WIDE NUMBER IS LARGER THAN 3100%. AND WE ARE THE OPTION TO KEEP PEOPLE LIVING INDEPENDENTLY IN THE COMMUNITY BUT NOT FOR NOT GIVEN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO ME ARE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. SO THE RESTORATION OF THE 10% CUT TO THE CURRENT PUBLISHED RATE FOR THOSE CENTER SUBJECT TO THE CUT WITH THE ADDITION OF A MODEST COLA INCREASE WILL ENSURE NECESSARY CONTINUITY OF CARE TO SOME OF THE STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE ELDERS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES BY AVOIDING NEW CLOSURES. IMPROVING STAFFING LEVELS AND SUPPORTING COMPLIANCE WITH NEW -- FEDERAL AND STREET RIGHT STATE REGULATIONS -- WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WERE SERVE TODAY CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THEIR HOMES WITH INDEPENDENCE AND WE NEED TO EXPAND ACCESS NOT BE CUTTING IT A TIME WHERE ARE AGING DEMOGRAPHIC IS HUGE. AND SPEAKING OF THE I. D. D. POPULATION WE ALSO SERVE PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE SERVE PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WE SERVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHRONIC DIABETES ALL OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT AT THE VERY BEGINNING FROM DOCTOR SMITH. WE'RE THEIR HOME. WHERE THE PLACE THEY COME DURING THE DAY SO THAT THEY AND IT COSTS ONE FIFTH OF THE COST OF A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY TO HAVE THEM COME TO ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE TO ME IT'S A NO BRAINER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM [inaudible] STE [inaudible] RESTORED. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS STAFF. I'M STEVE HORN PRESIDENT A CALIFORNIA MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION SOCIAIS ASIAN WE REPRESENT NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE AWARE NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION -- IS A BENEFIT FOR PEOPLE THAT -- HAVE PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS MENTAL LIMITATIONS MANY THE CLIENTS AS SHE TALKS ABOUT WE TAKE TO THEIR MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS. THEY REQUIRE ASSISTANCE THEY'RE UNABLE TO RIDE IN A PRIVATE AUTOMOBILE -- TAXI THEY NEED -- TO BE ESCORTED WHEELED -- FROM HOME TO THE DOCTORS WORTH -- SO THEY REQUIRE PHYSICAL ASSISTANCE THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE WHEELCHAIR BOUND. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RATE INCREASE FOR NINETEEN YEARS -- AND SO -- THEN WITH THE AB NINETY SEVEN CUTS IT HAPPENED WORK 10% LESS THAN WHAT THE RATE WAS NINETEEN YEARS AGO. HISTORICALLY WE'VE HAD MORE PROBLEMS IN URBAN -- IN EXCUSE ME IN RURAL AREAS THEN URBAN AREAS IN GETTING ACCESS -- TO TRANSPORTATION. YET OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS -- WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES IN THE COST OF FUEL IN THE COST OF INSURANCE WE ARE NOW SEEING THE SAME PROBLEMS IN URBAN AREAS AS WE ARE SEEING IN RURAL AREAS ABOUT NUMBER ONE FINDING ENOUGH PROVIDERS NUMBER -- TWO BEING ABLE TO FIND THE SPECIALIST FOR EXAMPLE -- MANY PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT THE CHILDREN SPECIALIST -- I OVERSEE FOR COMPANIES THAT WORK HERE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE DO ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND TRIPS A MONTH I COVER SALAAM CINEMA SOLANO MARIN. SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY I WORK WITH FEE FOR SERVICE AND WITH -- MANAGED CARE PLANS. WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL STEP UP TO THE PLATE THEY WILL PAY A MUCH HIGHER THAN MEDI CAL RATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PEOPLE SEE THEIR SPECIALIST WERE IN AND OUT OF A SPECIALIST IN SAN FRANCISCO STANFORD -- ALL DIFFERENT ERRORS AT THESE FAMILIES IN THESE CHILDREN GO IN EXCESS OF DISTANCE TO RECEIVE THESE MEDI CAL FEE FOR SERVICE FORGET IT CAN'T DO IT. I CANNOT TRANSPORT A MEDI CAL FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENTS LONGER THAN TEN MILES IN THE VEHICLE WITHOUT PAYING MONEY OUT OF MY POCKET. IN WITH THE COMPANIES THAT I WORK WITH THROUGHOUT THE STATE V.. THE ABILITY OF THESE COMPANIES TO OFFSET TO OTHER PAY SOURCES. THE LOSSES SO LARGE NOW WITH MEDI CAL IT'S NO LONGER AN OPTION SO MANY COMPANIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE A REFUSING TO TRANSPORT INDIVIDUALS ANY FARTHER THAN TEN MILES -- ONE SIR -- ONCE YOU'RE IN THE VEHICLE SO IT USED TO BE WHERE WE WOULDN'T WANT TO DRIVE ANTI OUT TOO FAR TO GET SOMEBODY WOULD BE WILLING TO TRANSPORT THEM FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES TO THEIR DOCTORS APPOINTMENT. IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW HERE IN SACRAMENTO I WILL NOT TRANSPORT A PATIENT FROM ROOSEVELT ELK GROVE TO SEE A SPECIALIST. BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE THAT IT COSTS AND I HAVE TO PAY MONEY TO SUBSIDIZE. THE STATE'S INADEQUACIES AND SO COMPANIES CAN NO LONGER SURVIVE -- LIKE THAT CURRENTLY SUTTER HOSPITALS PAYING US TO GO TO AUBURN EVERY TUESDAY THURSDAY SATURDAY -- TO TRANSPORT AND MEDI CAL BENEFICIARY -- TWO DIALYSIS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET ANY MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND I CANNOT DO IT. WITHOUT IT COST ME A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY YET CENTER HOSPITALS ONE THE STEP INTO THE PLATE TO SUBSIDIZE THE STATE'S INADEQUATE ON THAT PATIENT. SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS. MORE THAN JUST THE AB -- NINETY SEVEN CUT IT WE'RE LOOKING AT AN ADDITIONAL 25% -- ABOVE CURRENT MEDI CAL RATES. IN ORDER TO MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE AND AT LEAST LOOK AT THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR YEARS THAT COMPANIES CAN. STAY IN BUSINESS I REPRESENT A COMPANY THAT WORKS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY THEM BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR FORTY YEARS. THEY TRANSPORT. BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY CURRENTLY THEY'RE LOSING TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. AND BASED ON THE LONGEVITY THAT THEY'VE BEEN THERE IN THE OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY FEEL TO THE NURSING HOMES TO THE DIALYSIS CLINICS TO THESE MEMBERS TO THE MEMBERS FAMILIES TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND A SUSTAINABLE WAY THAT THEY CAN -- SERVICES AND NOT HAVE TO STOP THE SERVICES TO THOSE BEEN OFFICIERS BUT WITHOUT A RATE INCREASE WE DON'T SEE IT. AND CURRENTLY MINIMUM WAGE AND ALAMEDA IS WHAT THIRTEEN EIGHTY AND YOU KNOW IT'LL BE FIFTEEN IN NO TIME AT ALL AND ITS CURRENT -- EXPENSES OF THANKS FOR LOSING TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. SO. ALL OF OUR VEHICLES ARE SPECIALLY EQUIPPED TO REQUIRE DRIVER TRAINING DRIVERS ARE CERTIFIED -- COMPANIES ARE CERTIFIED THROUGH THE STATE. AND AT THIS POINT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SURVIVE -- BUT I DON'T SEE THAT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN -- MUCH LONGER. THANK YOU MISTER HORN FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MISMANAGED. HI I'M SHAUN ITEM I AM -- REPRESENTING THE FOR A FREE STANDING PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE SO IS HER LAST YEAR AND I WANT TO I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING US ANOTHER YEAR OF LIFE -- WE GOT PROP TWO TO SIX MONEY LAST YEAR LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE DO. SO WE'RE OTHERS ONLY FOR FREE STANDING PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA -- WE'VE COME TOGETHER -- AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THIS RIGHT NOW. OF WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE KIDS WHO ARE -- RIGHT FROM THEN NICK YOU I SEE YOU BRING TO OUR FACILITIES. ARE FACILITIES -- ARE -- WITH ALL GOT THEM. DOCTORS INTENSIVE THIS ARE THE HOSPITALS WE HAVE THE SAME STAFF AS THE HOSPITAL'S WITH ARCHIE'S NURSES -- SEEN AZL BIAN'S BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COME TO OUR PLACE IS. LET ME UP LONER SOME BACK UP -- FIRST OF ALL WE PROVIDE A SERVICE THAT YOU REALLY NEVER WANT TO USE BUT IF YOU NEED IT WE'RE HERE. AND SO WE TAKE KIDS WHO ARE MEDICALLY FRAGILE -- MY LAST ADMIT WAS THREE IS A THREE MONTH OLD WHO HAS THREE SEIZURES A DAY -- AND WE TAKE KIDS WHO HAS UNFORTUNATELY TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE AND FAILED KIDS WHO ARE IN CAR ACCIDENTS. SO WE SEE NOT ONLY A CHILD WHO IS POTENTIALLY DEVASTATED BUT A FAMILY THAT'S POTENTIALLY DEVASTATED. IN SO WHAT WOULD BY WE WERE CREATED WAS TO BRING THESE PEOPLE THESE BABIES KIDS INTO ENVIRONMENT THAT WE CAN HOLISTICALLY TREAT. SO WE CAN TREAT THE FAMILY'S COMFORT THEN WE CAN TREAT THE KIDS OUR GOAL IS TO GET THESE KIDS HOME. OR TO A HOME. OFF GROUNDS TO SCHOOL WE HAVE ACTIVITIES I HAVE ONE KID THAT -- WE HAD FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND SHE WANTED TO GO SWIMMING SHOULD NEVER TELL US WIMPLE SO OUR ACTIVITIES DEPARTMENT WENT OUT AND GOT. FIVE PLASTICS NGUYEN POOLS OF THESE KIDS WITH TRADES AND G. TUBES COULD EXPERIENCE SWIMMING SO I COULD SIT THERE AND SO THIS IS THE KIND OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO THAT -- THAT THE NICK YOU AND YOU YOU AT THE NICK USE KICK CAN'T GO -- BUT IF WE HAVE THE SAME STAFF -- IN SO BUT WHAT'S CRITICAL WE HOPE THEY CAN TALK WE FEED THEM IN SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT OUR STAFF KNOW THE KIDS. THEY KNOW THE KID THE BABY THAT COMES IN IT HAS THREE SEIZURES AS A SEIZURE IS THIS NORMAL IS IS NOT NORMAL. IN SO WE NEED TO KEEP STUFF -- THE SAME STAFF. AND WE ARE RATES HAVE BEEN FROZEN AS AS YOU KNOW FOR TEN YEARS -- AREN'T IT COSTS OF GONE UP BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO ALL OF OUR OWN TRANSPORTATION NOW SO WE'RE DOING THREE TRANSPORTATION TODAY WITH THE DRIVER CNN OR CNA. ARCHIE LV AND IN SO DOING THINGS GONE UP AS OUR EXPENSES -- AND WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME KEEPING THE DOORS OPEN AND KEEPING THE STAFF BECAUSE THE SAME STAFF THAT COME TO OUR FACILITIES ALSO GO INTO THE NICK USE THAT WORK THERE AND THEY GET. A LOT MORE MONEY -- BUT THERE ARE ONLY SO THERE'S FOR FREE FREE STANDING PEDIATRIC SUBACUTE WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO BEDS -- SIR TOGAS UP HERE IN SARATOGA. ALL SAINTS AND TOTALLY KIDS ARE IN -- THE LA AREA AND THERE'S ONE IN SAMBHAR INTO YOU KNOW -- WE'RE FULL WERE ALWAYS FULL WITH A WAITING LIST -- IN SO AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS THANK YOU AGAIN FOR GIVING US A LIFELINE LAST YEAR -- BECAUSE ALL WE'RE ALL HERE TOGETHER BECAUSE WE WILL CLOSE IF WE DON'T SEE AN INCREASE -- AND WHAT THAT MEANS THEN IS IS TO OUR FIFTY TWO KIDS THAT WE HAVE GO BACK INTO THE ICU AND THEY'RE TO BE HOUSE TO THE I SEE YOU. WERE GETTING EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY FOR THESE KIDS THANKS YOU GETS. MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE KIDS WHO REALLY NEED TO BE IN THE I SEE YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO JUST NOT GONNA MANY BEDS. IN SO THIS THREE MONTH. THIS -- THREE TO HAVE HER HEART DEVELOP YOUR DOCTOR YOU HAVE A HEART DEVELOP HER LUNGS ABILITY TO GO IN AND OUT OF SURGERIES. BUT WE GET THESE KIDSHOME WE GET HIM OFFENSE WE CAN WALKING AROUND WE GET THEM YOU KNOW THINKING THAT THEY'RE HAVING MEETINGS WITH US AND TELLING US WHAT TO DO. IN ADDITION WHERE POWER IN THE FAMILIES AND AND EXPOSING THEM TO ADD THESE KIDS TO WORLD THEY WOULDN'T HAVE IN THE NICK YOU. SO I'M HERE WE GOT FUNDING LAST YEAR WE'RE NOT IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR -- SO WE NEED -- A SMALL NOT ASKING FOR PROPERTY SIX MONEY AGAIN IN ADDITION TO WORKING WITH YOU TO RE -- RIGHT OUR RATE -- IN SO I THINK THAT'S ON MY CHECK. MY CHECKLIST BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THIS PANEL OF BRING IT UP TO THE DíAS FOR ANY QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON THIS. THANK YOU A MISS NIGHT OF FOR BRINGING THAT. TO OUR ATTENTION I DO IT I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE TOTALLY KIDS SEVEN SUMMER DO YOU KNOW AND THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE THERE. AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING -- AS FAR AS COLLECTING DATA -- THROUGH THE CHAIR WE CAN GET THAT DATA TO OUR OFFICE SO WE COULD -- GENERALLY LOOK AT IT WOULD BE GREATLY -- WITHOUT THE REASON WHY WE VAST THIS PANEL TO COME FORWARD IS AS WE HAVE A LARGER DISCUSSION ABOUT PROP FIFTY SIX WANTED TO MAKE SURE THOSE THAT. HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSIONS HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITIES TO PRESENT -- I'M QUITE WELL AWARE OF ALL THREE OF YOU BUT JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE REST OF THE DíAS AND COMMITTEE WERE ALSO A WHERE AND HOW -- NOT PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION OR HEALTH CARE DAY HEALTH CARE REALLY DID IMPACT OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE NECESSITY THAT YOU PROVIDED SO. THANK YOU FOR COMING FORWARD AND PROVIDING YOUR TESTIMONY IN WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL THREE HELLO KELLY I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PHYSICIANS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT TODAY. PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED COMMITMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO IMPROVE COVERAGE OF CARE FOR THE OVER THIRTEEN MILLION LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND ROLLED MEDI CAL. CMA ALSO COMMANDS THE GOVERNOR'S GOVERNOR FOR HIS INTENT TO RETURN ALL OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING TO SUPPORT PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES. THE MAIN CHALLENGE FACING PROVIDERS WHO WANT TO PERMANENTLY SEE AND SPEND MORE TIME WITH THAT HOW PATIENTS ARE THE DELAYS AND ANY HOPE APPROVALS OF THE SUPPLEMENT PAYMENTS BYCMS AND THE FACT THAT THE FUNDING IS NOT GUARANTEE. PROVIDERS DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL GET THE PAYMENTS EACH YEAR WHAT THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR AND CMS APPROVE THAT YEAR. WHEN ALL THE PAYMENTS GO OUT? FOR EXAMPLE THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE -- FOR MEDICAL MANAGE CARE THE MAJORITY OF PLANTS AREN'T YET ISSUE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED PAYMENT FROM DH CS. THERE ARE FEW MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE VOLUNTARILY ISSUING THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS BUT THE VAST MAJORITY DON'T ISSUE THEM UNTIL DH CS ISSUES THEN THE PAYMENTS. THE PLAN THEN HAS NINETY DAYS FROM RECEIPT OF THE MONEY TO ISSUE THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. SO IF EVERYTHING GOES RIGHT PROVIDERS WILL SEE THE IMPACT OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDING IN JUNE. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN YEAR BE ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF JUNE. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CME HAS PUBLICIZE THE AVAILABILITY OF THE FUNDS AS A MEANS OF ENCOURAGING MORE PHYSICIANS TO OPEN THEIR PRACTICE TO MEDI CAL PATIENTS. WE PERFORMED AN INTERNAL SURVEY IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BASED ON YOU'RE ONE OF THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN C. P. T. CODE SELECTED WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE THE ADDITIONAL CODES THAT. FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HALF OF THE PROVIDERS SURVEYED INDICATED THEY HAD NOT YET RECEIVED ANY SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ON THE FIRST SET OF CODES THUS FAR. A SIMILAR NUMBER OF PROVIDERS INDICATED THE AVAILABILITY OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR THE SPECIFIC CODES IMPACTS THEIR DECISIONS REGARDING THE NUMBER OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS THEY ARE ABLE TO SEE IN THEIR PRACTICE. TOP RESPONSES WHEN ASKED WHAT CHANGES TO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM WOULD BE IDEAL AND DRIVE PRACTICES TO OPEN OR EXPAND ACCESS FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS. WERE INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT OF COURSE ELIMINATING DELAYS IN PAYMENT OR A REDUCTION IN THE GENERAL MINISTRY. TO FOR ANOTHER CHALLENGES THE OVERALL TIMING OF DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN PERSPECTIVE. RETROACTIVE FEE FOR SERVICE AND MANAGE CARE PAYMENTS. IT IS ALSO COMPLICATED THIS YOU MAY HAVE TO CREATE OUR OWN TIMELINE INFOGRAPHIC TO ILLUSTRATE THE FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DISTRIBUTIONS FOR PHYSICIANS WHO SEE THE TWO POPULATIONS. LESSEN BY THE UNEXPECTED ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. TRACKING DOWN THE PAYMENTS AND PATIENT LEVEL DATA FROM THE PLANS OR MATCHING UP MULTIPLE SUB WHEN A PAYMENTS BASED ON FUNDING TIMELINES. PROVIDERS WILL BE ABLE TO RECLAIM CLINICAL TIME TO SPEND WITH BENEFICIARIES IF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN OF THE PAYMENTS ARE STREAMLINED. MEDIC HELL'S FAR FROM FIXED AND CMA DOESN'T WANT TO SLOW THE PROGRESS MADE THUS FAR IN TWO YEARS OF PAYMENTS. THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE THE PAST ADMINISTRATION AND CMS. SO REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS -- WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S THREE NEW PROGRAMS FUNDED BY PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU. THE ADMINISTRATION AND DH CS DEVELOP THE DETAIL WE SEE THE CURRENTLY SUPPLEMENTED CPT CODES AS CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NEWLY PROPOSED VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM PROPOSAL. FOR THE VALUE OF IT VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM TO FUNCTION THERE MUST BE ENOUGH ACCESS POINTS TO PREVENTIVE CARE AND THAT INCLUDES MAINTAINING THE STABILITY OF THE MEDICAL HOME MODEL IF. LACK OF A BETTER TERM. AS A GATEWAY TO ADDITIONAL SERVICES IN MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE. THOSE PROVIDERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO DEDICATE TIME TO THE CORONATION OF CARE IN ORDER TO BEST MANAGED BENEFICIARIES VARIED AND OFTEN COMPLEX CONDITIONS. PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN EXPANDING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE IN. CERTAIN SETTINGS AS EVIDENCED BY THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ABILITY TO LARGELY MEET THE STATE'S NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS. WHY WOULD WE DESTABILIZE OR ROAD THAT PROGRESS IN THOSE PROVIDER NETWORKS AND RECREATE THE PROBLEM WE HAVE NOW REMEDIED WITH THE CURRENT SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT STRUCTURE? AND YOU WANT TO GO OVER THE PROPOSAL'S -- FEEL FREE PLEASURE OKAY. WE SUPPORT THE CONVERSION OF THE CURRENTLY AND SUPPLEMENTED CPT CODES TO PERMANENT MEDIC HOW BASE RATE INCREASES. THIS INCREASE TO BASE RATES WILL RETURN CLINICAL TIME BACK TO PROVIDERS ALLOWING THEM TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THE Q. PATIENTS CORDONING CARE AND IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES. PROVIDERS WILL BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE CLINICAL TIME WITH PATIENTS IF THEY CAN COUNT ON THE FUNDING WITHOUT DELAYS RELAXING PAYMENTS. AND ARE MORE EASILY ABLE TO RECONCILE AND ADMINISTER THE SUPPLEMENT OKAY. IN ADDITION IF THEY'RE ABLE TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN OF RECONCILING THREE SETS OF SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FROM MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. THEY COULD INSTEAD USE RETAIN A CARE COORDINATOR TO FOLLOW UP ON APPOINTMENTS OR PERFORM HOME VISITS. SEEM IS WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE DEPARTMENT ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THIS PROPOSAL ON HOW WOULD BE ADMINISTERED. ADDITIONALLY IT ONCE FEDERAL PAROLE IS RECEIVE FOR THESE MEDICAL BASE RATE INCREASES. WE BELIEVE CONTINUED OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE PROGRAM IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE BENEFIT OF THESE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX DOLLARS CONTINUE TO FLOW FROM THE MEDIC MEDIC HOW MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PROVIDERS AS INTENDED. THE END I'M PRESENTING IS OUT OF ORDER BUT THE SECOND -- ONE IS. TO PROPOSE THE ADDITION OF FOR ADDITIONAL PER IT'S FOR WOMEN OVER FORTY YEARS OF AGE. AS THEY WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PREVENTIVE CODES ADDED LAST YEAR. FROM WHAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND -- THE CPT CODES ARE NOT INCLUDED AS THEY ARE PAID BY REPORT. MEANING THEY DON'T HAVE A MEDI CAL RATE ATTACHED TO THEM IN THE FEE SCHEDULE. INSTEAD THE PROVIDER SUBMITS THE CLAIM AND MEDICAL RECORDS AND DH CS DECIDES ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WHAT IT WILL PAY. WE ARE WORKING ON OBTAINING UTILIZATION DATA ON THESE FOR CODES FOR THE PART AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU WITH A COST ESTIMATE. THE FOURTH PROPOSAL OUT WE PROPOSE QUARTERLY BONUSES TO HOSPITAL BASED PHYSICIANS WHEN THE THRESHOLD OF VISITS IN THAT QUARTER EXCEEDS A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE. IN MANY MORE THAN AND MANY MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS THESE HOSPITAL BASED PHYSICIANS PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES TO MEDI CAL PATIENTS WHO HAVE NO OTHER CARE ACCESS POINTS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED FROM INCENTIVES TO IMPROVE OR MAINTAIN ACCESS. THE INCENTIVE CRITERIA WOULD BE DESIGNED MY DH CS IN CONJUNCTION WITH CURRENT REGIONAL UTILIZATION DATA IN ORDER TO ENSURE PROVIDERS PRACTICING IN THESE IMPORTANT SAFETY NET SETTINGS CONTINUE TO DO SO. THS MAY BE ABLE TO BE INCLUDED OTHER VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH PCS FOR THE DETAILS ON TO TOP DESIGNING THIS NEW PROGRAM. SO. I WE RECENTLY LEARNED -- AND OPPOSE -- A PROPOSAL BY CMS TO COLLAPSE TEN EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT CODES SOME OF WHICH WE CURRENTLY SUPPLEMENT. SO WE SUGGEST TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ALLOWING DH CS TO REASSIGN REASSESS CODES AFFECTED BY THIS POTENTIAL CHANGE WITHOUT A TRIGGER FOR AN ACCESS STUDY. THE COULD COLLAPSE WILL RESULT IN REDUCED PAYMENT. ESSENTIALLY IS THERE OR NO PAYMENT FOR SOME CODES BECAUSE IT WILL ELIMINATE THEM BUT PROP FIFTY SIX A MEDIC HOW WILL STILL BE PAYING THEM. JUST CONDENSED UNDER DIFFERENT CODE. SO SEE ME THINKING IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE DH CS TO AN ACCESS STUDY AT GREAT COST IF THE SERVICE REALLY IS NOT BEING ELIMINATED OR PAYMENT IS NOT BE REDUCED. ITS BEING RENAMED. A CO CLASS OF THIS NATURE HAS NOT BEEN ENACTED BUT CMS IS PURSUING IT FOR TWENTY TWENTY AND IS FACING GREAT OPPOSITION FROM THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY. COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO PROTECT WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE -- THUS FAR [inaudible] LASTLY CMA SUGGEST THAT ANY NEW PROGRAM FUNDING PROPOSED UNDER FIFTY SIX THAT DOES NOT GET DESIGN AND APPROVED BY CMS AND TIME. SHOULD INSTEAD BE DIRECTED TO PHYSICIAN AND DENNIS LOAN REPAYMENT. WE SPOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS EARLIER BUT THE PROPOSAL SIMILAR TO THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SPENDING PLAN WORD TWENTY TWENTY MILLION AND ONE TIME AND SPENT PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING. FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR WAS DEDICATED TO CREATING A PHYSICIAN AND DENNIS STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT. PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM WILL BE ORDER OVER TO LOANS OF PHYSICIANS AND% DENNIS TO SERVE OUR 30% THRESHOLD OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS. THE CRITERIA ARE CURRENTLY BEING FINALIZED AND APPLICATIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND AWARDS LIKELY ANNOUNCED IN THE FALL OF THIS YEAR SO VERY QUICK TURNAROUND. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NEXT SPRING. A GOOD AFTERNOON BRANDED HIM AND SPENCER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBER DENNIS ACROSS THE STATE -- REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE -- I DO I HAVE TO SAY YOU KNOW THIS CDA LOOKS AT PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX IS SOMETHING REALLY JUST OF A SEA CHANGE FOR THE MEDICAL DENTAL -- PROGRAM AFTER DECADES OF RATE STAGNATION WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING THESE THESE RATES COME IN AND I THINK ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES ON THE MAT ON THE GENOCIDE IS BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHERE OF THE DENTAL SERVICES ARE FEE FOR SERVICE. THERE AREN'T THE SAME COMPLICATIONS AS UNDER THE MAN IT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE SO DENNIS ARE GETTING THOSE TRACKS THEY'RE GETTING THEM IN A SINGLE CHECK WHERE THEY GET A YOU KNOW -- AN EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS THAT THIS IS YOUR RATE AND THIS IS YOUR SUPPLEMENTAL BUT ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE GETTING ONE PAYMENT AND THEY ARE SEEING THOSE THERE ARE SOME DELAYS -- THAT WE'RE SEEING AT THE BEGINNING OF BOTH THREE YEARS THERE TOOK SOME MONTHS BEFORE THOSE RATES ACTUALLY GOT OUT THE DOOR SO DENNIS DIDN'T START SEEING THAT I'M THE PAYMENTS UNTIL SIX ABOUT FIVE TO SIX MONTHS AFTER. BUT THEY ARE GETTING THEM RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE THEY'RE GETTING THEM AT WITH THE REST OF THEIR CHECKS AND SO THEY ARE REALLY SEEING THAT -- SO ANECDOTALLY WE'RE HEARING FROM THOSE MEMBERS THAT -- THIS REALLY THESE ARE MAKING CHANGES TO THEIR PRACTICES THEY'RE MAKING THE MORE SUSTAINABLE THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN EXPANDING WE GET COMPLIMENTARY CALLS FROM MEMBERS TALKING ABOUT HOW MEDI CAL AND THAT THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT -- YOU KNOW NOT TO SAY THAT EVERYTHING SPACE VERY PLEASED WHEN WE GET THOSE PHONE CALLS -- AND THEY CALL US AND THEY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING AT WHERE I CAN EXPAND I'M LOOKING AT BRINGING A NEW ASSOCIATE ON I'M LOOKING AT BRINGING MEDI CAL AND SO. ANECDOTALLY WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT MEDI CAL RATES ARE DOING WHAT THE VOTERS AND THIS LEGISLATURE INTENDED -- WE THINK BEYOND THE ANECDOTES THAT THERE ARE SOME NUMBERS AGAIN I THINK ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MEDICAL THE DENTAL SIDE IS THAT WHEN FEE FOR SERVICE. IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO GET THAT DATA WE HAVE ANNUAL DENTAL VISITS WE HAVE HOW MANY KIDS ARE GETTING PREVENTIVE VISITS WE HAVE. NUMBER OF DENNIS TOUR AND ROLLED I'M ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW WE'RE GETTING A MONTHLY UPDATES OF THROUGH THE DTI -- PILOT PROGRAM SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE PRETTY UP TO DATE DATA AND WE ARE SEEING -- I THINK AFTER OVER EIGHTEEN MONTHS. SINCE THE PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL RATES WENT INTO EFFECT WE'VE SEEN AT NEARLY 10% INCREASE IN PROVIDERS -- SO WHICH IS -- TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE NEW DENTAL OFFICES AND NINE HUNDRED AND TEN PROVIDERS SO AGAIN YOU KNOW IT'S A PROGRAM THAT SERVING THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE. THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE BUT THIS IS COMING AFTER DECADE OF DECADES OF STAGNATION AND DROPS AND SO FOR US THIS IS REALLY POSITIVE -- WE'VE ALSO SEEN UTILIZATION ESPECIALLY ON THE CHILDREN SITE IMPROVING IT'S A LITTLE HARDER ON THE ADULT SIDE JUST WITH ALL THE MORE RECENT CHANGES. TO A MEASURE THAT -- AND AGAIN THE DTI WE HAVE BETTER DAYS DOLE'S BUT WE'VE SEEN A 3% INCREASE THEIR SORT OF A A PRETTY STEEP DIFFERENT JUMP UTILIZATION AGAIN DOESN'T COMPLETELY SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT IF IT'S POSITIVE TO US -- WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CONTINUE THE RATES AND OUR BIG ASK THIS YEAR IS STABILITY THE SAME AS A CNA -- DENNIS ARE MAKING FINANCIAL DECISIONS ABOUT WE KNOW WHETHER TO OPEN A PRACTICE AND THEY NEED THAT STABILITY. BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE ONE YEAR. MRS BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE ONE YEAR SPAS. BUT WE WE CAN'T TELL THEM WHEN WE PROMOTE THIS OUT TO OUR DENNIS AND SAY HEY TAKE ANOTHER LOOK -- AT THE DENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WE SAY ONE YOUR SUPPLEMENTAL RATES WE CAN'T SAY THESE RATES ARE INCREASING -- THE DAY SHE'S BEEN RAISED THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY EVALUATION AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT'S BECAUSE WE JUST HAVEN'T CREATED ONE YET -- THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP US FROM DOING THAT. ON THE DENTAL SIDE WE DO HAVE DATA WE CAN LOOK AT SO WE JUST NEED TO DEVELOP AN EVALUATION PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT. AND FROM CITIES POINT OF VIEW WE DON'T THINK THAT STABILITY AND EVALUATION ARE NECESSARILY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE YOU COULD DO BOTH WHETHER THAT WAS PERMANENT BASE RATE CHANGES WHICH IS WHAT WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE -- AND SOME KIND OF EVALUATION NOTHING TIES YOUR HANDS OF THE OF THE HANDS OF THE FUTURE LEGISLATOR ABOUT MAKING DECISIONS DOWN THE LINE BASED ON EVALUATIONS REPORTS BUDGET BUDGETARY NECESSITIES -- THE ONE ISSUE THAT I WOULD BRING BEFORE YOU AYE IS ACTUALLY NOW YOUR ISSUE IT'S AROUND KIDS PREVENTION -- PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX DOES NOT HAVE ANY RATE INCREASES FOR KIDS PREVENTION IT'S ADULTS AND KIDS TREATMENT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE WHICH IS FOCUSED SOLELY ON KIDS PREVENTION WAS PUT IN PLACE BEFORE WE HAD. FIFTY SIX SO WE'RE TESTING SOME REALLY INNOVATIVE -- VALUE BASED CARE -- AND WE'RE PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT WE THINK ARE WORKING -- IT'S KIND WHEN BEEN SLOW TO GET OFF THE GROUND BUT WERE SEEING SOME IMPROVEMENT THERE SO THAT IN THAT PILOT PROJECT WILL AND WITH THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER IN TWENTY TWENTY AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN OTHER SETTINGS. BUT IT'S DEFINITELY A PROBLEM WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SOLVE AND AS WE LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE VALUE BASED -- PAYMENTS IT ALL THE LANGUAGE SO FAR AS TALKED ABOUT MEN AT MANAGED CARE AND PHYSICIANS BUT WE WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE DTI AND I'M TRYING TO DECIDE IF THERE'S WAYS WE CAN BRING DENTAL INTO THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE HUGE CONNECTIONS. BETWEEN CHRONIC CARE AND ORAL HEALTH AND GETTING AN EARLY AND DOING SOME OF THIS PREVENTION COULD -- AB INVOLVE A LOT OF COST SAVINGS FOR THE STATE. THINK WE ALSO SECOND THE COMMENTS OF CMA ON THE LOAN REPAYMENT WE'RE VERY EXCITED THAT THAT'S GETTING UP AND RUNNING THE DEPARTMENT HAS WORKED REALLY WELL WITH THE CMA FOUNDATION. ON GETTING THOSE OUT THE DOOR AND I BELIEVE WE'RE LOOKING AT HAVING AND FOLKS WE'RE GONNA BE STARTING TO GET THOSE PAYMENTS MADE THIS YEAR WHICHIS VERY FAST. AND IF THERE ARE EXTRA DOLLARS WE THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE TO REALLY CONTINUE TO EXPAND ACCESS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHEN YOU'RE READY? AFTERNOON CHAIR NUMBERS -- MY NAME IS ANDREAS AND MAKE ALLEN THE POLICY ADVOCATE FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA. NEAR REPRESENTING ALL SEVEN OF OUR AFFILIATES IN THE STATE AND THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE LOCATIONS -- THAT WE ARE IN ALL OF YOUR DISTRICTS -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS OUR EXPERIENCE SO FAR -- IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET THERE WAS AN ALLOCATION FOR A AS YOU'RE AWARE. OF FOR SUPPLEMENTAL RATES FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES SO SINCE SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN ARE HEALTH CENTERS HAVE BEEN RECEIVING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR THE FAMILY PRACTICE OFFICE VISITS. AS WELL AS NON MEDICATION ABORTION SERVICES IN MEDI CAL -- I JUST WANT TO TAKE THE TIME THAT WE HAVE TODAY TO SHARE SOME DATA THAT DEMONSTRATES WHY INVESTING IN FAMILY HEALTH FAMILY PLANNING AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IS. IS A WISE INVESTMENT WITH THIS FUNDING -- AND KIND OF REVISIT THOUGHT% WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS -- PANEL TODAY SO WE'VE BEEN REALLY FOCUSING ON A LINING THE USE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS WITH THE STATED GOALS OF PROPERTY. SIX TO INCREASE TIMELY ACCESS AND QUALITY CARE AND ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE GEOGRAPHIC SHORTAGES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE -- THAT EVEN WITH A COMMITMENT TO MAKE ANY EXISTING ALLOCATION OF FUNDING ON GOING -- AS IS THE CASE FOR THE OTHER PROVIDERS. FUNDS DO NEED TO BE DRAWN DOWN FIRST [inaudible] ADVANCEMENTS HE CAN BE REALIZED -- REFERRING SPECIFICALLY TO STAFF CAPACITY IN INFRASTRUCTURE. DOT SAID -- I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO SHARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS WITH YOU TODAY. SO -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AFFILIATES TO PER TO BRING UP SOME DATA TO THE STATE LEVEL --% SO I WANT TO START WITH SAYING AT THE STABILIZING EFFECT FROM THIS FROM THE RATES. WITHOUT ALL AFFILIATES WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR LEVELS OF SERVICE. AS WELL AS A MAJORITY OF HEALTH CENTERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN SERVICES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT'S NEEDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THIS CAN INCLUDE ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO HIV PREVENTION GENDER AFFIRMING CARE AS TI IS -- TESTING IT FOR PREGNANT WOMEN. EARLY PREGNANCY CARE SUCH AS MISCARRIAGE EVALUATION AS AS WELL AS SOME PRENATAL CARE AND ALL ICAL PROCEDURES -- THEY'RE WANTING TO PROVIDE MAINTENANCE AND SERVICES AND THIS. YOU KNOW NOW WITH THIS DEBILITY THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED -- THIRTY BILL TO ADDRESS THOSE PATIENTS NEEDS MORE -- AT LEAST TWENTY HEALTH CENTERS HAVE INCREASED THEIR HOURS OF OPERATION THUS INCREASING ACCESS TO SERVICES WHEN AND WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED MOST. SEVERAL AFFILIATES INCLUDING THOSE -- WITH HEALTH CENTERS IN RURAL AREAS -- SURE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPROVE ACCESS FOR PATIENTS AT TARGETED LOCATIONS. BY PROVIDING APPOINTMENTS ON EVENINGS SATURDAYS AND IN THE LEAST ONE CASE EVEN EXPANDING SEVEN DAYS PER WEEK. SO FAR WAIT TIMES FOR HIGH NEED LOCATIONS AND CERTAIN KEY SERVICES -- HAVE BEEN CUT ROUGHLY IN HALF THE VERY SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF INFORMATION BUT WITH THIS EXAMPLE -- THE AVERAGE WAIT TIMES FOR A LONG ACTING REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTIVES ARE GETTING A LARK OR AN ARM IMPLANT -- AT AN APPOINTMENT FLAT IN THE LA REGION HAS BEEN REDUCED BY 72% -- OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE REQUESTED THE STATE FOR HALF AT THE CHICO LOCATIONS SO AGAIN HIGHLIGHTS -- WE ALSO LOOKED INTO SOME OF THE QUALITY OF PATIENT SERVICES AND KIND OF HOW OUR YOU KNOW PHILLY AT STAFF ON THE GROUND HAVE BEEN SEEING CHANGES IN QUALITY. THEY HAVE MENTIONED TO US THAT THERE'S BEEN IMPROVEMENT BY HIRING SOME SPECIALIZED STAFF -- AS AS MUCH AS THEY'RE ABLE TO MOVE FOR WITH ANY OF THAT SO QUICKLY. THIS WOULD INCLUDE LICENSE TRAINERS PEER ADVOCATE COORDINATORS PATIENT NAVIGATORS AND CASE MANAGERS -- I'D LIKE TO SEE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CASE MANAGERS THERE SO CRITICAL TO TIMELY CARE FOR PATIENTS WHO NEED AND CANCER PREVENTION -- AN EARLY EARLY TREATMENT FOLLOW UP VISITS ALSO AS HE EYES I HEARD CONGENITAL SYPHILIS EARLY MENTIONED EARLIER -- THIS HAS BEEN YOU KNOW WE KNOW WE HAVE HEALTH CENTERS AND SOME OF THOSE HOT SPOTS AND SO HAVING THE CASE MANAGERS ABLE. TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE IN GETTING PATIENTS IN FOR WHAT THEY NEED ESPECIALLY FOR THINGS LIKE SYPHILIS -- CASE MANAGERS A LOAN ON IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AFFILIATES. HAVE -- BEEN ABLE. TO SERVE MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND PATIENTS PER MONTH WHEN WE COLLECTED THE STAFF. THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL RESIDENTS IN THE ALLEY REGION AND THE NUMBER OF MID LEVEL CLINICIANS IN ORANGE COUNTY AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES ARE NOW TWO AND A HALF TIMES WHAT THEY WERE IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN SO THE TIME THAT THEY WERE SORT OF HOPING LET'S. SOME OF THESE OPENINGS -- THAT WAS ALLOWED IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS BECAUSE OF THIS FUNDING. ALSO AN ORANGE COUNTY SAN BERNARDINO AREA THERAPISTS -- BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENT A FEW WORK FORCE RECRUITMENT AND RETAIN IT MEASURES I KNOW EVERYONE'S ON BOARD WITH RECOGNIZING THAT AS AS A LARGE UP HILL ISSUE OF SO THIS IS SORT OF A SILVER LINING -- THEY WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING TO DECREASE CLINICIAN TURNOVER BY 19% WITHIN ONE YEAR -- IN NOT AFFILIATE AND INCREASED NUMBER PATIENTS OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF RETAINING AS PROVIDERS. SO THIS WAS LARGELY -- A SUCCESS AND THAT IT IT ALSO HELPS. GET RID OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF COSTS THAT ARE SEXY TURNOVER -- SO THAT'S THAT'S A LOT OF A LOT OF HIGHLIGHTS. I DON'T KNOW IF WE STILL HAVE MORE. TIME. NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND IF WE CAN MOVE ON TO MR CLUBS. IT'S LIKE YOU. TURN THAT ON THANK YOU DOCTOR INTO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS MARK CLAUS ON THE PRESIDENT AND CEO FOR HOME OF GUIDING HANDS. HOME THE GUIDING HANDS IS A COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION -- THAT WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN AND IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WE CURRENTLY. PROVIDE SUPPORT TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THAT LIVE AND TWENTY FIVE ARE IN THE INTERMEDIATE CARE COMMUNITY BASED I SEE OF HOMES -- THOSE HOMES AS YOU KNOW ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY FUNDED BY MEDICARE -- IN IN BY ALMOST -- I SAY THAT -- IS ORGANIZATIONS LIKE MINE RELY VERY HEAVILY ON FUND RAISING -- IN FUND RAISING TO PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICES QUALITY STAFFING AND QUALITY OUTCOMES FOR OUR RESIDENTS. IN ADDITION TO MY ROLE AS THE CEO -- YOU ALSO SERVE ON THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ALSO AS A BOARD MEMBER FOR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES NETWORK. YES AND IS A STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED ICF ORGANIZATIONS I SEE AFTER MANY BASS TONE THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- IN IN TOTAL THERE ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS UP THE ICS IN CALIFORNIA. DROPS FIFTY SIX FUNDS -- BOTTOM LINE IS THEY HAVE BEEN A LIFE LINE A TRULY A LIFELINE TO ICF PROVIDERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT THESE FUNDS MY ORGANIZATION WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CLOSE SEVERAL. IF NOT ALL OF OUR PHONES -- A AND PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE SUPPORTED FOR MANY YEARS WOULD HAVE LOST THEIR HOUSES -- IN NINETY IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE OUR RATES WERE FROZEN AT THE LEVELS THAT THEY WERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SO. BUT SOME OF THE OTHERS YOU FOR TODAY OUR RATES BEEN FROZEN FOR ELEVEN YEARS -- YOU KNOW SET SET TIME ALMOST ONE HUNDRED ICF HOMES SMALL COMMUNITY BASED HOMES HAVE HAVE CLOSE THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. PROP FIFTY SIX FOR THE ICF SAYS DEFINITELY HAD A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT FOR OUR RESIDENTS -- FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES. PROP FIFTY SIX FUND'S HAVE ALLOWED US IN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE HOME OF GUIDING HANDS. TO RETAIN GOOD QUALITY STAFF ESPECIALLY THOSE STAFF -- WITH SENIORITY. WE'VE GOT -- OUR ORGANIZATION OUR AVERAGE TEN YOUR FIRST AFTER A SIX POINT EIGHT YEARS WE HAVE MANY STAFF THAT HAVE BEEN WITH US. TWENTY FIVE THIRTY SEVERAL OF THEM OVER FORTY YEARS AND THESE THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES GIVEN THEIR THEIR TIME TO PROVIDE GOOD QUALITY CARE SO THIS THESE FUNDS OF A ENABLED US. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN KEEP THOSE TENURED STAFF IS PAIN OR ATTRACT IF YOU WILL QUALITY STAFF -- THE MINIMUM STANDARDS IN OUR IN OUR OPERATIONS FOR MANY OF OUR STAFF FOR EIGHTEEN WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. WE HAVE NINE HUNDRED STAFF WE HAVE ONE PERSON AT EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD. WHAT WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR OUR STAFF -- WE NEED EXPERIENCE QUALITY INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING GOOD QUALITY STEHR -- CARE -- IT'S ALSO ALLOWED US. TO MAKE SOME MUCH NEEDED MODIFICATIONS AND SOME OF OUR HOMES TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS AS THEY AGE TO AGE IN PLACE TO AGE WITH WITH DIGNITY -- INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SUPPORT MOVING TO A NURSING HOME -- IS IS NOT THE BEST OPTION. SO PROPERTY PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS HAVE DEFINITELY ASSURED CONTINUED -- ACCESS TO MEDICARE RECIPIENTS. DS THEN -- WOULD LIKE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO DEVELOP A RATE THAT ADEQUATELY FUNDS SERVICES. THAT CAPTURES THOSE COSTS -- TO PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICES. AND TO MEET LEE LIFT THE RATE FREEZES IMPLEMENTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT TO THE BOTTOM LINE AND IT REALLY ISN'T ABOUT. HOME OF GUIDING HANDS IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT I SEE A PROVIDERS. IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT WE SUPPORT. IT'S ABOUTPEOPLE LIKE TERRY -- TERRY'S ONE OF OUR RESIDENTS TERRY MOVED IN TO OUR HOMES IN AUGUST OF NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN SO IT TRULY IS THE ONLY HOME THAT TERRY HAS EVER KNOWN. AND WITHOUT THESE FUNDS TERRY WOULD BE SOMEWHERE ELSE SO I I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CLAUS. I WANT TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT -- CHANCE TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THE LAST TWO PANELS IF YOU SO WEST. AND ALSO TO OPEN IT UP AND TO PUBLIC COMMENT FOLLOWED BY QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE. RIGHT SO I WOULD JUST SAY -- BOTH FOR THIS PANEL AS WELL AS THE PREVIOUS -- WE WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE THAT -- THE USE OF THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS HAS -- PRESENTED US BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO CHANGE THE WAY WE DO ACTRESS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY WE'RE REALLY EXCITED AROUND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE USED THE FUNDING FOR I THINK WE WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE THAT. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD IN TERMS OF OPERATIONALIZE IN THE FIFTY SIX FUNDS -- IS CONCOMITANT WITH YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL APPROVALS THAT WE HAVE TO GET AND THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE AROUND HOW FUNDING IS DIRECTED THROUGH THE MANAGED CARE PLAN SO WE CERTAINLY. BOTH APPRECIATE AND SOMETIMES FEEL VERY MUCH THE PROVIDER -- STRESS AROUND HOW THOSE FUNDS FLOW BUT I THINK THAT WE ARE CERTAINLY COMMITTED -- TO BEING THOUGHT FULL PARTNERS IN THE USE OF THESE FUNDS WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY -- IT DIDN'T IT'S BETTER FOR OUR PROGRAM IS BETTER FOR BENEFICIARIES AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS WELL AS IN PLACES WHERE WE CAN -- DO THOUGHTFUL INVESTMENTS OR CHANGES WERE CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT. THANK YOU WITHOUT WILL NOW HEAR PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE. FIVE HI MY NAME IS KEN REQUIRING THE PRESIDENT CEO OF INNOVATION TELL SYSTEMS WE OWN THE SARATOGA PEDIATRIC SUBACUTE. COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLY THAT I THOUGHT WERE IMPORTANT THERE'S FOR PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE IN THE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE ALL SNIFFS. THERE'S TWELVE HUNDRED AND FORTY SNIFFS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE WERE ALL PART OF AB SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE WE'RE WE AGREED TO PAY Q. A FEES IN ORDER TO GET AN ANNUAL INCREASE. THE FOR SUBACUTE SNIFFS ARE FORCED NOT RECEIVED THE THE BENEFIT OF THOSE Q. A FEES SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO BRING UP -- WE ARE VERY BLESSED TO BE INCLUDED IN PROP FIFTY SIX FOUR AND A TWELVE FORTY MAKES YOU ENDANGERED SPECIES IN THE FUNDING STAY THE WAY IT WAS WE WOULD BE GONE -- BUT WE'RE TOLD TODAY THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN OUR PROP FIFTY SIX MONEY'S GONNA GET PAID IN ONE OF THE THINGS I GOT INDICATED IT MAY NOT BE PAID TILL JUNE. AND IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO AUGUST FIRST OF LAST YEAR. SO THAT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR US THE LAST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS A LITTLE DIRTY SECRET AROUND MEDI CAL PAYMENTS -- INDIVIDUALS TAX PAYERS LIKE MYSELF BUSINESS MEMBERS WE EXPECT TO HAVE MEDI CAL DELAYS WHEN THERE'S A BUDGET ISSUE. BUT FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS WE HAVE THAT THOSE TWO WEEKS IN JULY WHERE THEY SKIP OUR PAYMENTS TO GO TO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. YOU DON'T EXPECT THAT IN BUDGET SURPLUSES. AND I'VE HEARD RUMBLINGS ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD COST THE STATE THE BUY BACK THOSE TWO WEEKS. AGAIN THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU EXPECT YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S BUDGET SURPLUSES TO HAVE A TWO WEEK DELAY AND FOR US MY FACILITIES ALONE. PAYROLL IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY TWO WEEKS. I'M IN CUPERTINO WHICH ARE I MEAN SARATOGA WHICH IS FIVE MILES FROM CUPERTINO WHERE HOME CELL FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT. PEOPLE THAT WORK IN -- YET WORKING CAR WASHES MAKE MORE THAN MY CERTIFIED NEEDS NURSE'S ASSISTANTS. SO WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE KEEPING STAFF. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. KATIE LATE NOT BE HALF OF THE CHILDREN SPECIALTY CARE COALITION REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEDIATRIC SUB SPECIALIST IN CALIFORNIA. PEDIATRIC SUB SPECIALISTS HAVE A MEDIC HOW PATIENT POPULATION NOT CAN OFTEN EXCEED 60% AND MANY REGIONS OF THE STATE. AND ARE STILL PREDOMINANTLY REIMBURSED THREE FEE FOR SERVICE WITH RATES BETTER SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE NATION. THE PROP FIFTY SIX PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL TO IMPROVE RATES AND HELP RECRUIT AND RETAIN PEDIATRIC SUB SPECIALISTS WHERE THERE ARE DEMONSTRATED SHORTAGES WE WANT TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE EXTENSION AND EXPANSION OF THE PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. AS WELL AS MAKING THEM PERMANENT WE WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HOSPITAL BASED PHYSICIAN BONUS PAYMENTS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH CMA THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE HONEST MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY. AND FINALLY WE WERE THRILLED TO SEE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT PROGRESS. THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS PAMELA REP AND I'M HERE WITH SARATOGA AND TOTALLY KIDS AND I'M WITH ALL SAINTS HEALTH CARE -- WE HAVE A OBVIOUSLY -- VERY WE'RE VERY HAPPY AND I AM PLEASED THAT WE GOT OUR PROP FIFTY SIX MONEY AND WE'RE HERE TO ASK IT WE CONTINUED -- UNTIL WE CAN RIGHT RIGHT SIZE IRATE I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE INFORMATION SINCE THE INCEPTION. OF PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE -- THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH FOR ABOUT TWENTY TWO YEARS -- THOSE WHO HAD THE FORWARD THINKING APPROACH IN THE CARE OF THESE MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN SUCH AS DOCTOR COOK. WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN WRITING THE REGULATIONS FOR PEDIATRIC SUFFOCATES. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN SO INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN SO MANY WAYS THAT THESE CHILDREN HAVE HOPE. THAT THEY NEVER HAD. OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE RELEGATED TO BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT DOESN'T LEND ITSELF. TO A REAL QUALITY OF LIFE BY THAT WE'RE ABLE TO ASSIMILATE THESE KIDS BACK INTO SOCIETY THESE ARE KIDS ON VENTILATORS. TRICKS FEEDING TUBES AND WE CAN TAKE OUR TIME WINNING THEM. AND GETTING THEM HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES THESE FAMILIES ARE IN CRISIS. AND THE PROP FIFTY SIX MONEY HAS HELPED US STAY IN BUSINESS WITHOUT THAT MONEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT HAPPENED WE HAVEN'T HAD A RATE INCREASE AS IT'S BEEN REITERATED. FOR WE'RE GOING ON ELEVEN YEARS -- THESE KIDS ARE MEDICALLY FRAGILE BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE. AND HAVE AMAZING SUCCESS STORIES AND I'LL JUST LEAVE YOU WITH ONE OF THOSE SUCCESS STORIES. WE HAD -- A BOY THAT WAS WITH US SINCE HE WAS TEN AND WHEN HE TURNED EIGHTEEN WE WERE ABLE. TO TRANSITION HIM HOME. AND HE HAS A COMPLETELY DISFIGURED FACE AND SO ONE DAY HE CAME BACK TO SEE ME AND I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS DOING HE SAID HE WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB AND NO ONE COULD HIDE WOULD HIRE HIM. SO AS HE WAS AFTER WE FINISHED OUR CONVERSATION HE WAS WALKING OUT AND WHEN HE WAS WALKING DOWN THE HALL I SAID TO MYSELF. WHY DON'T I HIRE HIM? AND SO I DID AND THAT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO AND HE WORKS WITH GIVES BACK TO OUR PEDIATRIC KIDS. AND HE WORKS IN ACTIVITIES AND HE'S AN AWESOME KID. AND HE UNDERSTANDS THOSE KIDS BETTER THAN WE DO ACTUALLY SO I JUST THANK YOU FOR THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU AND AND REALLY ASK RESPECTFULLY. THAT YOU WOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER EXTENDING MONEY SO THAT WE CAN SERVE THESE MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. DOCTOR CHAIR MEMBERS TO MADDEN REPRESENT CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS WHO WAS ONE LETTER VOICE IN SUPPORT. OF A NUMBER OF CMA'S PROPOSALS AS RELATES TO PROP. FIFTY SIX IN JUST AS A QUICK REFRESHER FOR PHYSICIANS AS NOT BEING EMPLOYED BY HOSPITALS ARE REIMBURSEMENT IS TIED DIRECTLY TO THE PATIENTS THAT WE SEE. AND WE WILL LOOK AT SOME OF THE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE LOOKING AT LET'S SAY THE THIRTY FACILITIES -- THE NUMBER MEDI CAL RELEASE THEY SEE IS AN ENORMOUS 91%. 91% IS THE HIGHEST VOLUME FOR A FACILITY IN THIS IS NOT A SMALL FACILITY THIS IS A FACILITY. THAT SEIZE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS A HUNDRED AND ELEVEN THOUSAND PATIENTS. NINETY THREE THOUSAND PATIENTS ARE MEDI CAL ENROLLEES SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT GROUP. AND THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO STAFF THAT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITH EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS IT BECOMES REALLY CHALLENGING SO HOW THEY DO IT IS A TEN THE RIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE MID LEVEL PRACTITIONERS. AND WHAT THAT DOES TO YOUR THROUGHPUT VOLUME AND YOUR WAIT TIMES THAT INCREASES BECAUSE A PA OR AN ANTI JUST CAN'T SEE AS MANY PATIENTS. AS AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN CAM SO WE THINK OF AN IDEA OF LOOKING AT QUARTERLY -- SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS BASED ON CERTAIN UTILIZATION WOULD BE OUR SUGGESTION TO LOOK AT THOSE HIGH VOLUME FACILITIES. AND REALLY TRY TO GET THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE -- MAINTAIN THEIR STAFFING AT CURRENT LEVELS THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MEGAN SUBER'S HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES WHICH REPRESENTS THE OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY SERVE ABOUT SIX AND A HALF A LITTLE OVER SIX AND A HALF MILLION PATIENTS AT THIS TIME I WANTED TO FIRST THANK THE DEPARTMENT AND THE PANELISTS -- FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION THIS FAR ON THE PROP FIFTY SIX EFFORTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS AND SOME OF THE EFFORTS ARE LOOKING TO TO PURSUE THIS YEAR. I JUST WANTED TO RAISE ONE ITEM AS IT RELATES TO PROP FIFTY SIX AND THAT'S THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROPOSAL WE ARE EXCITED TO SEE THAT PROPOSAL -- IN THE BUDGET -- BUT AT OUR EARLY CONVERSATIONS HAVE A SORT OF RAISING QUESTIONS FOR US ABOUT IF OUR HEALTH CENTERS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT THOSE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS -- HEALTH CENTERS PARTICIPATE NOW WITH THEIR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND LOTS OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AROUND A CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER INTEGRATION -- DIABETES PREVENTION AND THEY'RE WORKING -- WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR MILLION MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES THAT WE SERVE AND WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS A POPULATION -- THAT WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING THESE SORT OF A QUALITY BASED INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO SO WE WOULD LIKE TO JUST AS THIS PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND -- WHICH PROVIDERS ARE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE PROGRAM AND HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO UP TO WORK WITH THAT PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. JENNIFER SENATOR BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES INCLUDED IN OUR MEMBERSHIP IS BOTH THE PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE FACILITIES THE FREE STANDING. ON THAT DID AN EXCELLENT JOB -- SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THEMSELVES TODAY AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE NEAR INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED AGES IN THE ENDS WITH ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED INCLUDED IN OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE AND SEVEN THOUSAND THAT ARE HEARING CALIFORNIA FORT -- THAT COMMENTS MADE BY BOTH THE PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE -- PROVIDERS AND ALSO -- ARE ICY FTD AN H. IN AND REPRESENTATIVE TODAY I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE PART FIFTY SIX FUNDS CONTINUE FOR BOTH OF THOSE PROVIDERS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMIND FOLKS HOW. HOW MUCH A COST EFFECTIVE PROVIDER BOTH OF THESE ENTITIES ARE PEDIATRIC SUBACUTE SORRY I'M A THIRD OF THE COST OF A INPATIENT HOSPITAL STAY? THE ICY FTTH IS AN ENDS ARE AN EXCELLENT COMMUNITY PROVIDER THAT IS A LICENSED HEALTH CARE FACILITY -- THAT PROVIDES A HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENT AT PROBABLY THE LEAST AMOUNT OF OF COST TO THE GENERAL FUND -- MEDI CAL MATCHING FUNDS -- MANY THINGS THAT THEY DO WELL AND THEY'RE ALSO COST EFFECTIVE PROVIDER SO WE WANT TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR THE CONTINUATION OF THE PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR THESE PROVIDERS OVER TIME -- THE ICF -- A SPOKESPERSON TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT -- THEY PAY A QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE -- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES GENERALLY THAT'S THE WHOLE I MEAN THE PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE SO I APOLOGIZE -- SAID THAT THEY PAY THEIR THE QUALITY ASSURANCE EVEN ARE INCLUDED IN THE RATE -- OVER TIME HEY SHOULD BE PART OF THAT BUT THEY NEED TO GET THEIR COSTS RIGHT SIDED THEY NEED A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THEY CAN ADJUST. AND MOVE INTO A COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM SO IN BOTH CASES BOTH TYPES OF PROVIDERS NEED THEIR RATES AND FROZEN BUT THEY DO NEED A PLAN TO MAKE SURE THEY STAY HOLE AND THEY MOVE FORWARD AND THE PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS CAN BE THAT -- THAT SOLUTION FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BUT I DO THINK WE NEED A LONG TERM SOLUTION SO THESE FOLKS CAN BUDGET. CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE INCREASES TO STAFF THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN KEEP -- IN CAN HIRE NEW STAFF KNOWING THAT THEY CAN BUDGET FOR THAT IN THE FUTURE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED LINDA OF WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WERE PLEASED TO SEE THE VALUE BASED PURCHASING PROPOSED SO FOCUSED ON QUALITY OUTCOMES BUT WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND LOOKING AT REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES -- IN WHAT WE ALSO SUPPORT RESTORING THE AB NINETY SEVEN CUTS ARE LEGAL AID.

OF A PATIENT LOAD. OF THOSE WAS USED DON'T CAN. AS MR BAN SAID IF YOU'RE PATIENT BASIS VERY HIGH MEDI CAL ALREADY THE SUPPLE PAYMENT SHOULD BE DIRECTED MORE TOWARDS YOU THEN SOMEONE WAS LOW VERY LOW PERCENTAGE.

OF BY RACE ETHNICITY LANGUAGE SOCIO ECONOMIC FACTORS AT CETERA OUR CONCERN IS NOT SHARED A CERTAIN PART PATIENT POPULATION DO TREMENDOUSLY BETTER THAN OTHER POPULATIONS. THAT MAY APPEAR TO BE AN INDICATION OF OVERALL IMPROVEMENT AND REALLY MASK THE WORSENING OF CONDITIONS FOR OTHER GROUPS -- SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF TRENDS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SO LAST LEE IS WE ANTICIPATE TRAILER LANGUAGE YOU WE WOULD URGE A REQUIREMENT FOR DH CS TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN CRAFTING.
