00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:34.292
NUMBER IS INCREASING AT AROUND

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:36.662
A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER

01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:23.906
EIGHTEEN- PROHIBITION AND THAT

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:26.542
THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED THAT

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:28.911
THAT'S THAT'S IN STATUTE TODAY-

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:31.280
MAY. YEAH THAT WAS A BALLOT

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:33.015
ISSUE SO THIS BILL IS NOT GOING

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:35.751
TO CHANGE- THE- THAT AS WE MOVE

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:38.787
FORWARD THAT NOT WITHSTANDING-

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:41.190
STILL REMAINS AN ISSUE BUT-

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:44.093
THE- DOESN'T SEEM TO ME THAT-

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:46.128
THAT'S A GOOD ENOUGH REASON TO

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:49.231
ABANDON ARC OF MOVEMENT TO WANT

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:51.400
TO MAKE SURE THAT LOW INCOME-

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:55.370
WATER USERS- THAT- GET INERT IT

01:12:55.437 --> 01:12:57.539
ARREARS SHOULD HAVE THEIR-

01:12:57.606 --> 01:13:00.175
WATER SHUT OFF- WITHOUT HAVING

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:05.514
SOME SORT OF- WATER. A RICH

01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:06.181
MANAGEMENT PLAN OFFERED TO THEM.

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:08.117
FIGURE FROM MY CONCERN IS THAT

01:13:08.183 --> 01:13:10.285
OF KIND OF. THE COOKIE CUTTER

01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:12.454
IN IT WOULD SEEM BETTER APPLIED

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:14.656
ON ON A MORE ON. DISTRICT BY

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:16.892
DISTRICT OR AGENCY BY AGENCY

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:18.827
SO- I JUST NEED TO HAVE A

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:21.363
LITTLE MORE. INFORMATION ON IT

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:22.865

BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.171

FORGIVENESS OR PAYMENT PLAN OR

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:40.249

CONCERNS ABOUT A FACILITIES

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:36.605
COMPLIANCE WHICH IS WHY ANOTHER

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:37.939
REASON THIS STEP SHOULD BE

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:40.909
REMOVED ALL TOGETHER. SB FIVE

OVERSIGHT OF THESE FACILITIES

01:19:57.993 --> 01:19:59.528
OUR INTENT IS TO NOT

FACILITIES TO CARRY OUT THEIR

01:20:03.798 --> 01:20:05.267
BUSINESS. BUT BECAUSE THE

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:07.202
FACILITY THAT HANDLES TOXIC

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:09.037

THERE ARE THREE MAIN CHALLENGES.

02:01:42.728 --> 02:01:44.330
FIRST THE COST IS ENORMOUS

02:01:44.397 --> 02:01:46.432
COVERAGE ESTIMATES THAT WE WILL

02:01:46.499 --> 02:01:48.234

MORE FOR STAFFING VEHICLES

TAXES FOR COMPOSTING IT IS

02:02:06.786 --> 02:02:09.288
DIFFICULT TO SAY THE LEAST. THE

02:02:09.355 --> 02:02:09.989
SECOND GREATEST CHALLENGES

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:12.692
PERMITTED WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

02:02:12.758 --> 02:02:14.560

B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IT WAS

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:29.008
IMPOSSIBLE FOR LOCAL

02:02:29.075 --> 02:02:30.876
GOVERNMENTS TO MOVE FORWARD

02:02:30.943 --> 02:02:32.478
WITH DEVELOPING ORDINANCES.

02:02:32.545 --> 02:02:34.580
IMPLEMENTING TAX RATE INCREASES

OF THESE EFFORTS REQUIRE A

02:02:42.421 --> 02:02:43.889
GREAT DEAL OF TIME AND EXPENSE

TO NOW CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A

02:35:22.012 --> 02:35:23.047
RECOGNIZE THE BILL'S A WORK IN

02:35:23.113 --> 02:35:24.348
PROGRESS THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN

02:35:24.415 --> 02:35:26.150
WILLING TO WORK WITH US TO

COMMIT SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WE

02:35:26.817 --> 02:35:28.318
SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. BOB

SPECIFICALLY THE AUTHOR WILL BE

02:35:31.522 --> 02:35:32.690
AMENDING THE BILL TO INSTEAD OF-

02:35:32.756 --> 02:35:34.692
DIRECTING AIR BE TO CREATE THIS

02:35:34.758 --> 02:35:35.959
GREEN HYDROGEN CREDIT PROGRAM

02:35:36.026 --> 02:35:37.494
HAVE THEM FIRST CONSIDER IT

02:35:37.561 --> 02:35:38.395
MAKING A DETERMINATION THAT

02:35:38.462 --> 02:35:39.563
DOING SO WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE

02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:41.131
INAPPROPRIATE USE OF THE CAP

02:35:41.198 --> 02:35:43.934
AND TRADE PROGRAM. I KNOW ONE

02:35:44.001 --> 02:35:45.536
OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK THE

02:35:45.602 --> 02:35:47.771
SPONSORS WERE- YOU'RE

02:35:47.838 --> 02:35:48.739
COMFORTABLE WITH THIS IS

02:35:48.806 --> 02:35:50.507
BECAUSE- IT WOULD IT WOULD IT

02:35:50.574 --> 02:35:53.577
WOULD CREATE A- BY DOING WHAT

02:35:53.644 --> 02:35:54.278
WE'RE DOING HERE IT WOULD IT

02:35:54.344 --> 02:35:57.281
WOULD. IT WOULD- AREA FIFTY

02:35:57.347 --> 02:35:58.682
YEAR BE DOES DECIDE TO ADOPT

02:35:58.749 --> 02:35:59.616
THIS IT WOULD MAKE IT A FASTER

02:35:59.683 --> 02:36:02.319
PROCESS. THAN THAN THE LONG

02:36:02.386 --> 02:36:03.821
PROCESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH.

02:36:03.887 --> 02:36:05.389
THEIR ADOPTION NOW WITHOUT THIS

02:36:05.456 --> 02:36:07.925
BILL- BUT I CERTAINLY I THINK

02:36:07.991 --> 02:36:09.126
BY THE COMMITTEE ULTIMATELY

02:36:09.193 --> 02:36:10.094
WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE BE

02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:11.228
REALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:36:11.295 --> 02:36:12.129
CONSIDER THE IMPACTS OF

02:36:12.196 --> 02:36:13.330
CREATING A PROGRAM THAT WE GIVE

02:36:13.397 --> 02:36:14.598
THEM SPACE EITHER GO FORWARD

02:36:14.665 --> 02:36:15.733
WITH THAT OR NOT BASED ON

02:36:15.799 --> 02:36:18.102
THEIR- THEIR OWN JUDGMENT. SO

02:36:18.168 --> 02:36:19.770
ANYWAY WE FIGURE THIS PATH FOR

02:36:19.837 --> 02:36:22.172
THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS. SO

02:36:22.239 --> 02:36:22.740
WHILE UNFORTUNATELY ANALYSIS

02:36:22.806 --> 02:36:24.775
DOESN'T REFLECT. THESE CHANGES

02:36:24.842 --> 02:36:26.243
WE DO HAVE COPIES OF THE MARKUP

02:36:26.310 --> 02:36:26.910

HYDROGEN. HI- YOU KNOW I CAME

02:42:40.217 --> 02:42:40.684
INTO THE LEGISLATURE WHEN

02:42:40.750 --> 02:42:42.052
SCHWARZENEGGER WAS GOVERNOR AND

02:42:42.119 --> 02:42:43.687
HE WAS THE BIG ADVOCATE AND I

02:42:43.753 --> 02:42:45.655
<u>AS NOT A SUPPORTER OF HYDROGEN</u>

02:42:45.722 --> 02:42:47.657
AT THAT TIME. I MEAN THE

02:42:47.724 --> 02:42:48.959
INTERESTING THING IS HYDROGEN

02:42:49.025 --> 02:42:54.030
THE MOST BASIC AND MOST- IT'S

02:42:54.097 --> 02:42:55.165
AN ABOVE ONE OF THE MOST

02:42:55.232 --> 02:42:56.266
ABUNDANT ELEMENTS IN THE ENTIRE

02:42:56.333 --> 02:42:58.301
UNIVERSE SO. YOU KNOW IF YOU

02:42:58.368 --> 02:43:00.137
CAN HARNESS IT CORRECTLY YES

02:43:00.203 --> 02:43:02.105
YOU WANT TO USE IT HOWEVER.

02:43:02.172 --> 02:43:04.107
THAT THE POINT THAT GOVERNOR

02:43:04.174 --> 02:43:05.442
SCHWARZENEGGER WAS ADVOCATING

02:43:05.509 --> 02:43:07.344
FOR HYDROGEN WE WERE NOT

02:43:07.410 --> 02:43:09.112
ANYWHERE NEAR THE PLACE WHERE

02:43:09.179 --> 02:43:11.481
WE COULD PRODUCE IT FROM

02:43:11.548 --> 02:43:14.618
RENEWABLE SOURCES. IN IN FACT

02:43:14.684 --> 02:43:15.418
THE HYDROGEN THAT WE'RE

02:43:15.485 --> 02:43:17.988
PRODUCING WAS EVEN MORE CARBON

02:43:18.054 --> 02:43:19.723
IN TESTS. BECAUSE OF THE

02:43:19.789 --> 02:43:21.658
QUANTITY OF FOSSIL FUELS THAT

02:43:21.725 --> 02:43:22.926
WAS USED TO PRODUCE IT SO IN

02:43:22.993 --> 02:43:25.028
EFFECT IT WAS NOT A BENEFIT IT

02:43:25.095 --> 02:43:26.563
WAS A BENEFITTED FROM A TAIL

02:43:26.630 --> 02:43:28.098
PIPE IN TERMS OF. TAIL PIPE

02:43:28.165 --> 02:43:29.866
EMISSIONS BUT YOU YOU KNOW WAS

02:43:29.933 --> 02:43:34.404
NOT USEFUL FOR. MANY OF OUR

02:43:34.471 --> 02:43:34.971
GOALS HOWEVER. TECHNOLOGIES

02:43:35.038 --> 02:43:37.440
HAVE ADVANCED MORE RESEARCH HAS

02:43:37.507 --> 02:43:39.843
BEEN DONE AND WE ARE PRODUCING

02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:41.912
SO MUCH RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT

02:43:41.978 --> 02:43:44.114
WE HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO

02:43:44.181 --> 02:43:46.449
PRODUCE HYDROGEN AND THEN YOU

02:43:46.516 --> 02:43:48.552
IT'S A VERY FLEXIBLE BECAUSE IT

02:43:48.618 --> 02:43:50.487
CAN BE UTILIZED FOR FUEL OR

02:43:50.554 --> 02:43:52.489
UTILIZED FOR STORAGE ENERGY

02:43:52.556 --> 02:43:54.424
STORAGE ELECTRICITY STORAGE. OR

02:43:54.491 --> 02:43:56.660
UTILIZED IMAGE JUST HAS A LOT

02:43:56.726 --> 02:44:00.897
<i><u>F CAPABILITIES SO- THERE ALSO</i></u>

02:44:00.964 --> 02:44:02.999
WHEN I SAY RENEWABLE ENERGY I.

02:44:03.066 --> 02:44:05.202
ALSO REFER REFERENCE THINGS

02:44:05.268 --> 02:44:08.805
LIKE WASTE THAT. OUR BIO GASSER

02:44:08.872 --> 02:44:10.774
ACQUISTARE FORCE WASTE THAT

02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:12.409
THOSE THINGS COULD ALSO BE

02:44:12.475 --> 02:44:14.110
PRODUCTIVELY USED TO PRODUCE

02:44:14.177 --> 02:44:18.014
HYDROGEN. ARMS AND MUCH OF THE

02:44:18.081 --> 02:44:20.016
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE ALREADY

02:44:20.083 --> 02:44:21.751
HAVE WITHIN THE FOSSIL FUEL

02:44:21.818 --> 02:44:23.853
SYSTEM COULD POTENTIALLY BE

02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:26.590
USED FOR HYDROGEN WHICH WOULD

02:44:26.656 --> 02:44:28.391
HELP US RETAIN SOME OF THE JOBS

02:44:28.458 --> 02:44:30.594
IN THAT SECTOR AS WE MOVE OFF

02:44:30.660 --> 02:44:35.131
OF FOSSIL FUELS. SO WHILE THE

02:44:35.198 --> 02:44:36.566
BILL DOES NOT- GUARANTEE ANY

02:44:36.633 --> 02:44:38.935
THAT IT POSITIONS CALIFORNIA TO

02:44:39.002 --> 02:44:40.737
BEGIN PLANNING IN THAT WAY SO

02:44:40.804 --> 02:44:42.505
THAT WE CAN TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE

02:44:42.572 --> 02:44:43.673
AND IT SENDS A MARKET SIGNAL

02:44:43.740 --> 02:44:46.142
SO. IT VANCE'S GREEN HYDROGEN

02:44:46.209 --> 02:44:48.511
BY REQUIRING OUR AIR RESOURCES

02:44:48.578 --> 02:44:50.847
BOARD AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES

02:44:50.914 --> 02:44:52.983
TO START PLANNING FOR THIS. MAN

02:44:53.049 --> 02:44:55.652
TO- INCLUDED IN THE SCOPING

02:44:55.719 --> 02:44:57.854
PLAN AND IT CLARIFIES THAT

02:44:57.921 --> 02:44:59.089
GREEN ELECTRIC CHARGING SHOULD

02:44:59.155 --> 02:45:00.523
BE INCLUDED IN THE STATE'S

02:45:00.590 --> 02:45:02.225
PLANNING FOR RESOURCE ADEQUACY

02:45:02.292 --> 02:45:03.326
BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE A

02:45:03.393 --> 02:45:05.462
STATUTORY DEFINITION FOR GREEN

02:45:05.528 --> 02:45:07.430
ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN. AND IT

02:45:07.497 --> 02:45:09.299
REQUIRES THE PC TO ADD GREEN

02:45:09.366 --> 02:45:11.067
ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN INTO ANY

02:45:11.134 --> 02:45:12.602
FUTURE STORAGE PROCUREMENT

RELEASED FROM FOREST FIRE. THAT

02:59:27.456 --> 02:59:31.360
MIND YOU. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN

02:59:31.427 --> 02:59:34.230
OUR ECOSYSTEM BEFORE WE SETTLED

02:59:34.296 --> 02:59:35.431
HERE IN THE SEEK IT BEFORE WE

02:59:35.498 --> 02:59:37.399
SETTLED FIRE NATURALLY BURNED

02:59:37.466 --> 02:59:39.869
IN CALIFORNIA. OUR LANDSCAPES

02:59:39.935 --> 02:59:41.437
IN MOST PLACES EVERY TEN YEARS

02:59:41.504 --> 02:59:43.005
IN SOME PLACES MORE OFTEN IN

02:59:43.072 --> 02:59:45.374
SOME PLACES NOT SO OFTEN. BUT

02:59:45.441 --> 02:59:46.041
WHAT DID THAT DO THE FIRE

02:59:46.108 --> 02:59:48.277
BASICALLY FIT AND ARE FOR OUR

02:59:48.344 --> 02:59:50.246
FORCE LANDS IN OUR BRUSH LANDS

02:59:50.312 --> 02:59:53.883
AND GAVE US A ECOSYSTEM THAT

02:59:53.949 --> 02:59:56.652
WAS BALANCED. WE CAME ALONG AND

02:59:56.719 --> 02:59:58.387
WHAT DID WE DO WE SUPPRESSED

02:59:58.454 --> 02:59:59.989
FIRE FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS

03:00:00.055 --> 03:00:04.093
NOW SO. ARE FORCED AND OUR OUR

03:00:04.160 --> 03:00:06.295
RANGELANDS ARE NOT IN THE SAME.

03:00:06.362 --> 03:00:08.831
PLACE THEY WERE BEFORE WE CAME

03:00:08.898 --> 03:00:10.666
ALONG AND SETTLED THIS LAND IS

03:00:10.733 --> 03:00:13.235
STARTED MANAGER LANCE. SO THE

03:00:13.302 --> 03:00:15.070
ECOSYSTEM IS OUT OF BALANCE AND

03:00:15.137 --> 03:00:17.406
QUITE FRANKLY. WE'VE SEEN

03:00:17.473 --> 03:00:19.408
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AND THE

03:00:19.475 --> 03:00:20.476
FIREFIGHTERS THAT ARE SO

03:00:20.543 --> 03:00:22.478
DEVASTATING THAT THIS IS

03:00:22.545 --> 03:00:24.079
BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH FUEL

03:00:24.146 --> 03:00:26.015
OUT THERE AND WHAT AND WHAT

03:00:26.081 --> 03:00:28.184
HAPPENS WHEN WE HAVE ALL THIS

03:00:28.250 --> 03:00:30.052
FUEL LOAD. WE HAVE TOO MANY

03:00:30.119 --> 03:00:35.558
TREES PER ACRE IN AND. THE

03:00:35.624 --> 03:00:39.228
CASCADES THE TRINITY ALPS THE

03:00:39.295 --> 03:00:40.796
COASTLINES PARKS CARBON

03:00:40.863 --> 03:00:42.798
SEQUESTERS WE ALL LEARNED IN

03:00:42.865 --> 03:00:43.899
FIFTH GRADE THAT WHEN WE

03:00:43.966 --> 03:00:46.835
BREATHE OUT CARBON MONOXIDE.

03:00:46.902 --> 03:00:48.537
THE TREES BREATHE IT IN AND

03:00:48.604 --> 03:00:50.573
THEY FILTER IT IS THE BIGGEST

03:00:50.639 --> 03:00:52.341
FILTER SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA.

03:00:52.408 --> 03:00:54.677
AND IT IS IMPAIRED AND I AM

03:00:54.743 --> 03:00:56.412
SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATED I I'VE READ

03:00:56.478 --> 03:00:58.347
THE ANALYSIS ON THIS. ON THIS

03:00:58.414 --> 03:01:00.950
BILL AND YOU KNOW NOBODY WANTS

03:01:01.016 --> 03:01:01.517
TO TACKLE THE BIG ISSUES IN

03:01:01.584 --> 03:01:04.453
CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE HAVE TOO

03:01:04.520 --> 03:01:07.756
MANY TREES PER ACRE. WHEN THE

03:01:07.823 --> 03:01:10.659
SNOW ACTUALLY FALLS. IT DOESN'T

03:01:10.726 --> 03:01:12.595
TOUCH THE GROUND BECAUSE IT

03:01:12.661 --> 03:01:13.162
LANDS ON THE BRANCHES OF THE

03:01:13.229 --> 03:01:15.798
TREES. AND THAT CAUSES A DAPPER

03:01:15.864 --> 03:01:17.666
TRANSPIRATION. THAT MEANS WHEN

03:01:17.733 --> 03:01:19.535
THE WIND BLOWS IT EVAPORATES

03:01:19.602 --> 03:01:20.502
AND IT GOES AWAY IT DOESN'T

03:01:20.569 --> 03:01:22.371
LAND ON THE FOURTH FLOOR

03:01:22.438 --> 03:01:25.007
BECAUSE IT'S TOO THICK. IN

03:01:25.074 --> 03:01:26.175
WE'VE SEEN CATASTROPHIC

03:01:26.242 --> 03:01:28.244
WILDFIRE WE'VE LOST MILLIONS OF

03:01:28.310 --> 03:01:32.881
ACRES. IANS. FOUR POINT TWO

03:01:32.948 --> 03:01:34.450
MILLION ACRES WHEN YOU THINK

03:01:34.516 --> 03:01:36.085
ABOUT HOW MUCH LAND THAT IS AND

03:01:36.151 --> 03:01:37.453
HOW WHAT DEVASTATING YEARS AND

03:01:37.519 --> 03:01:39.722
WE DON'T COUNT THE CARBON WE

03:01:39.788 --> 03:01:40.322
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE CAR NO WE

03:01:40.389 --> 03:01:43.325
REGULATE. CARBON THAT COMES

03:01:43.392 --> 03:01:48.797
FROM. DIESEL TRUCKS AGRICULTURE

03:01:48.864 --> 03:01:53.168
EQUIPMENT BOATS SHIPS TRAINS

03:01:53.235 --> 03:01:57.373
AND WE TRY TO MANAGE THE SYSTEM

03:01:57.439 --> 03:01:59.241
BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE

03:01:59.308 --> 03:02:00.676
SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY IMPACTING

03:02:00.743 --> 03:02:02.411
THE ENVIRONMENT BLACK CARBON IN

03:02:02.478 --> 03:02:04.179
THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEVASTATION

03:02:04.246 --> 03:02:06.315
FROM FIRE IS SOMETHING THAT

03:02:06.382 --> 03:02:07.716
NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO THE

03:02:07.783 --> 03:02:10.319
SCOPING PLAN THIS BILL THIS

03:02:10.386 --> 03:02:11.520

03:02:32.875 --> 03:02:33.876
TO YOU AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS OUT

03:02:33.942 --> 03:02:35.444
THERE. THERE'S NO WAY AS

03:02:35.511 --> 03:02:36.545
SOMEBODY WHO CARES ABOUT THE

03:02:36.612 --> 03:02:38.714
ENVIRONMENT CANNOT. DO

03:02:38.781 --> 03:02:40.916

WE'RE HAVING EVER MORE

03:06:10.292 --> 03:06:12.094
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES I JUST

03:06:12.160 --> 03:06:13.228
YESTERDAY I WAS ON A CALL WITH

03:06:13.295 --> 03:06:14.563
A BUNCH OF USC STUDENTS HAVE

03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:16.498
BEEN HELPING ME THINK ABOUT

03:06:16.565 --> 03:06:19.601
WHAT FAR CHALLENGES- WHEN WE

03:06:19.668 --> 03:06:20.569
TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS THE NEW

03:06:20.636 --> 03:06:21.837
NORMAL I MEAN IT I THINK FOR A

03:06:21.904 --> 03:06:24.439
LONG TIME WE JUST. KIND OF WE

03:06:24.506 --> 03:06:25.007
ALWAYS KNEW THAT YOU KNOW WE

03:06:25.073 --> 03:06:25.641
ALWAYS KNEW THERE WAS THIS WITH

03:06:25.707 --> 03:06:28.110
FIRE. CHALLENGE THIS LIABILITY

03:06:28.176 --> 03:06:30.012
THIS THIS DANGER. IS

03:06:30.078 --> 03:06:32.180
VULNERABILITY- BUT IT WAS THE

03:06:32.247 --> 03:06:32.915
KIND OF THING WOULD HAPPEN

03:06:32.981 --> 03:06:34.616
OCCASIONALLY AND NOW IT'S JUST

03:06:34.683 --> 03:06:35.984
BECOME A KIND OF AN ANNUAL

03:06:36.051 --> 03:06:37.753
OCCURRENCE THAT TIME NOT ONLY

03:06:37.819 --> 03:06:38.954
IN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS BUT

03:06:39.021 --> 03:06:40.088
MY NECK OF THE WOODS IN THE BAY

03:06:40.155 --> 03:06:42.858
AREA- IN HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I

03:06:42.925 --> 03:06:44.359
WE GOT LIGHTS FLICKERING OUT IN

03:06:44.426 --> 03:06:45.494
THE MIDDLE TODAY BECAUSE THE

03:06:45.561 --> 03:06:47.362
SMOKE FROM THE WILDFIRES HAS

03:06:47.429 --> 03:06:48.730
GOT TO BE SO INTENSE IN THE IN

03:06:48.797 --> 03:06:50.198
THE SMOKE THE WORLD READING IS

03:06:50.265 --> 03:06:52.000
GOING TO BE SO INTENSE AND SO.

03:06:52.067 --> 03:06:53.569
IT'S- IT'S AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM

03:06:53.635 --> 03:06:55.370
NOW I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO

03:06:55.437 --> 03:06:56.471
SAY THAT WE'RE JUST NOT DOING

03:06:56.538 --> 03:06:57.773
ANYTHING ABOUT IT I MEAN WE

03:06:57.839 --> 03:06:58.807
KNOW I THINK IT'S TAKING TOO

03:06:58.874 --> 03:07:00.776
LONG- BUT OBVIOUSLY WE JUST

03:07:00.842 --> 03:07:03.478
PASSED A MAJOR- BONFIRE

03:07:03.545 --> 03:07:05.681

03:07:05.747 --> 03:07:07.416
ADDRESS- WILL BE A WILDFIRE

03:07:07.482 --> 03:07:09.084
MITIGATION THIS IS OF COURSE AN

03:07:09.151 --> 03:07:10.452
IMPORTANT PART OF THE BOND

03:07:10.519 --> 03:07:12.087
DISCUSSION WITH SB FIFTY FOUR.

03:07:12.154 --> 03:07:13.555
THERE'S A LOT IN THERE ABOUT

03:07:13.622 --> 03:07:16.258
WILDFIRES- AND JUST A LOT OF

03:07:16.325 --> 03:07:17.759
CONFERS OUR COMMITMENT EVEN

03:07:17.826 --> 03:07:18.860
THIS LATEST PACKAGE AND WE DID

03:07:18.927 --> 03:07:20.395
I THINK IT'S JUST THE START OF

03:07:20.462 --> 03:07:20.996
WHAT IS IT IS CERTAINLY GOING

03:07:21.063 --> 03:07:22.764
TO BE MORE AND MORE. RESOURCE

03:07:22.831 --> 03:07:25.701
AND ATTENTION AND TIME GIVEN BY

03:07:25.767 --> 03:07:27.269
THE EVERYONE FROM THE GOVERNOR

03:07:27.336 --> 03:07:28.070
TO THE LEGISLATURE TO THE TOP

03:07:28.136 --> 03:07:30.973
AGENCIES. TO START DEALING WITH

03:07:31.039 --> 03:07:32.941
THIS ENORMOUS PROBLEM- THAT

03:07:33.008 --> 03:07:37.646
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY. RIGHT TO

03:07:37.713 --> 03:07:38.647
TALK ABOUT AND POINT OUT. AND

03:07:38.714 --> 03:07:40.515
THEN THEY TRY TO JUST FOCUS ON.

03:07:40.582 --> 03:07:41.650
MY ISSUE AND I THINK OUR

03:07:41.717 --> 03:07:44.953
COMMITTEE ISSUE WITH THE BILL I

03:07:45.020 --> 03:07:45.554
REALLY HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE

03:07:45.621 --> 03:07:49.825
APPROACH. OF MUSIC THE D. V.

03:07:49.891 --> 03:07:51.493
THE QUESTION ABOUT HOW THE

03:07:51.560 --> 03:07:54.096
EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN. PARSE

03:07:54.162 --> 03:07:55.631
OUT THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS

03:07:55.697 --> 03:07:57.699
BETWEEN NATURAL CARBON CYCLES

03:07:57.766 --> 03:07:59.468
AND HUMAN ACTIVITY IN GHG

03:07:59.534 --> 03:08:00.802
EMISSIONS RESULTING FROM

03:08:00.869 --> 03:08:02.904
NATURAL LANDS AND I GUESS THE

03:08:02.971 --> 03:08:04.640
QUESTION THAT THAT IS GOING TO

03:08:04.706 --> 03:08:05.707
CONTINUE TO COME UP FOR US IS

03:08:05.774 --> 03:08:07.776
HOW HOW WE CAN CALL FOR AN

03:08:07.843 --> 03:08:10.779
ADMIN FOR THE PLAN FOR- GHG

03:08:10.846 --> 03:08:11.546
REDUCTIONS FROM NATURAL

03:08:11.613 --> 03:08:12.681
PROCESSES IN THE SCOPING PLAN

03:08:12.748 --> 03:08:13.415
BEFORE WE KNOW HOW TO

03:08:13.482 --> 03:08:14.616
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN IT

03:08:14.683 --> 03:08:16.485
NATURAL PROCESS HE'S- AND THOSE

03:08:16.551 --> 03:08:17.586
EMITTING CARBON AS A RESULT OF

03:08:17.653 --> 03:08:18.854
HUMAN ACTIVITY WE MAY KNOW WHAT

03:08:18.920 --> 03:08:20.322
IGNITES A FIRE FOR EXAMPLE BUT

03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:21.256
WE YOU KNOW HOW DO WE DETERMINE

03:08:21.323 --> 03:08:23.058
HOW MUCH THC FROM ANY GIVEN

03:08:23.125 --> 03:08:23.925
FIRES NATURAL AND TO BE

03:08:23.992 --> 03:08:26.261
EXPECTED. WHAT IS THE NORMAL

03:08:26.328 --> 03:08:28.430
BASELINE WE DEVIATED FROM-

03:08:28.497 --> 03:08:30.065
OBVIOUSLY WILDFIRES HAVE ALWAYS

03:08:30.132 --> 03:08:32.934
BEEN A AN EMITTER- FROM LONG

03:08:33.001 --> 03:08:35.337
BEFORE. YOU KNOW THE YEAR OF

03:08:35.404 --> 03:08:39.908
THE- THE SPANISH- SO AND INTO

03:08:39.975 --> 03:08:42.144
ACCEPT IT IS A FREE THERE IS A

03:08:42.210 --> 03:08:43.545
NATURAL PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH

03:08:43.612 --> 03:08:45.147
FIRE IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF

03:08:45.213 --> 03:08:46.882
OUR ECOSYSTEM HERE IN

03:08:46.948 --> 03:08:49.885
CALIFORNIA- OF COURSE YOU KNOW.

03:08:49.951 --> 03:08:51.420
YOU POINT OUT EVERYONE KNOWS

03:08:51.486 --> 03:08:53.789
THAT THAT HUMAN. INTERACTION

03:08:53.855 --> 03:08:54.823
HUMAN ENGAGEMENT OUR

03:08:54.890 --> 03:08:56.224
TRANSMISSION LINES THAT THAT

03:08:56.291 --> 03:08:57.459
THE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT

03:08:57.526 --> 03:08:59.361
WE HAVE HAVE EXACERBATED THE

03:08:59.428 --> 03:09:01.930
SITUATION. AMP AND PUT IT IN A

03:09:01.997 --> 03:09:02.931
PLACE WHERE NOW WE REALLY HAVE

03:09:02.998 --> 03:09:04.266
TO START TO GRAPPLE WITH

03:09:04.332 --> 03:09:07.335
WILDFIRES AS HUMAN CAUSED-

03:09:07.402 --> 03:09:10.906
POLLUTER AND IN ADDITION TO. NO

03:09:10.972 --> 03:09:15.477
PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT. SO NOW.

03:09:15.544 --> 03:09:16.645
OF COURSE WELFARE SEVERITY

03:09:16.712 --> 03:09:18.280
VARIES FROM FROM YEAR TO YEAR-

03:09:18.346 --> 03:09:19.548
ANDERSON QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE

03:09:19.614 --> 03:09:20.582
PLAN FOR EMISSION REDUCTIONS

03:09:20.649 --> 03:09:22.451
FROM FIRE WE CAN ANTICIPATE

03:09:22.517 --> 03:09:24.086
HOUSE OF YOUR SEASON WILL BE.

03:09:24.152 --> 03:09:25.220
IS REMEMBERED SENIOR TO MORE

03:09:25.287 --> 03:09:27.155
MORE SEVERE- WE KNEW WE KNOW

03:09:27.222 --> 03:09:28.457
THAT LIMITING OFF I WAS NOT THE

03:09:28.523 --> 03:09:29.357
CORRECT FORCE MANAGEMENT

03:09:29.424 --> 03:09:30.592
APPROACH- BUT WITHOUT KNOWING

03:09:30.659 --> 03:09:31.693
INAPPROPRIATE WILDFIRE

03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:33.595
EMISSIONS BASELINE WITH. WITH

03:09:33.662 --> 03:09:35.831
STATUTORY. DIRECTION TO

03:09:35.897 --> 03:09:37.833
MAXIMALLY REDUCE EMISSIONS-

03:09:37.899 --> 03:09:40.001
THAT COULD BE JUST FOR BACK TO

03:09:40.068 --> 03:09:42.671
DOING. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

03:09:42.738 --> 03:09:44.239
STUDYING THIS ISSUE IS A BETTER

03:09:44.306 --> 03:09:46.875
APPROACH IT ALLOWS US TO FIGURE

03:09:46.942 --> 03:09:48.176
BEFORE POTENTIALLY SETTING BACK

03:09:48.243 --> 03:09:49.911
OUR CLIMATE GOALS WRIT LARGE.

03:09:49.978 --> 03:09:51.780
NOTS ON OF COURSE ANOTHER HUGE

03:09:51.847 --> 03:09:54.082
PART OF THIS EFFORT WE KNOW

03:09:54.149 --> 03:09:55.951
WITH PART OF CALIFORNIANS- THE

03:09:56.017 --> 03:09:57.252
THOUGHT PROCESS HERE IS THAT WE

03:09:57.319 --> 03:09:58.220
DO WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE A

03:09:58.286 --> 03:10:01.056
LEADER. I KNOW IN IN IN IN IN

03:10:01.123 --> 03:10:01.690
FOCUSING ON EMISSIONS REDUCTION

03:10:01.757 --> 03:10:03.625
IN THOSE AREAS THAT- THERE

03:10:03.692 --> 03:10:08.363
REALLY ARE ENTIRELY- AND- HUMAN

03:10:08.430 --> 03:10:11.800
CAUSED- YOU KNOW I GUESS I

03:10:11.867 --> 03:10:13.435
GUESS YOU SAID SB THIRTY TWO

03:10:13.502 --> 03:10:15.303
REQUIRES CALIFORNIA TO GET 40%

03:10:15.370 --> 03:10:16.838
NINETY NINETY. EMISSION LEVELS

03:10:16.905 --> 03:10:18.507
BY TWENTY THIRTY ONE THE

03:10:18.573 --> 03:10:19.074
QUESTION IS WHAT SHOULD OUR

03:10:19.141 --> 03:10:21.343
WILDFIRE EMISSIONS BE 40% LOWER

03:10:21.409 --> 03:10:22.911
THAN THEY WERE NINETEEN NINETY.

03:10:22.978 --> 03:10:24.780
IS THAT IS THAT SAYS THAT HOW

03:10:24.846 --> 03:10:25.380
WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT I

03:10:25.447 --> 03:10:27.415
DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS. SO I'M

03:10:27.482 --> 03:10:28.316
VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE

03:10:28.383 --> 03:10:29.785
AUTHOR'S INTENT I AGREE WE NEED

03:10:29.851 --> 03:10:30.685
TO TAKE AGGRESSIVE STEPS TO

03:10:30.752 --> 03:10:32.053
REDUCE THE SEVERITY AND

03:10:32.120 --> 03:10:32.854

THE ANALYSIS WAS VERY

03:12:58.133 --> 03:13:00.402
COMPELLING WHAT MAKES YOU

03:13:00.468 --> 03:13:01.970
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT TAKING THE

03:13:02.037 --> 03:13:06.274

MY OPENING REMARKS SO I WAS I

03:13:10.211 --> 03:13:11.780
ASKED FIVE YEARS AGO ONE

03:13:11.846 --> 03:13:12.981
SENATOR CHESBRO WAS THE CHAIR

03:13:13.048 --> 03:13:14.349
OF NATURAL SOURCES AND I WAS

03:13:14.416 --> 03:13:16.251
THE VICE CHAIR THAT WE DO WE

03:13:16.318 --> 03:13:17.852
SCOPED IT PETITIONS COPING PLAN

03:13:17.919 --> 03:13:20.755
FOR A R. B. NEVER HAPPENED. I

03:13:20.822 --> 03:13:24.859
ACTUALLY WAS VERY KEY IN SB

03:13:24.926 --> 03:13:25.460
NINE OH ONE WHEN I WAS IN THE

03:13:25.527 --> 03:13:26.461
SIMPLY SIDE IT WAS ACTUALLY

03:13:26.528 --> 03:13:28.229
REPUBLICAN LEADER AND I'M AND

03:13:28.296 --> 03:13:30.098
JUST SENATOR WILL- ASSEMBLY

03:13:30.165 --> 03:13:31.733
MEMBER WOULD NOT HELD OUT UNTIL

03:13:31.800 --> 03:13:33.735
WE GOT THE LANGUAGE PUT IN.

03:13:33.802 --> 03:13:37.839
THAT BILL TO ACTUALLY DO IT- IT

03:13:37.906 --> 03:13:39.040
HAS A IT'S IN THERE BUT IT'S A

03:13:39.107 --> 03:13:41.509
IT'S A- IT'S NOT QUANTIFYING

03:13:41.576 --> 03:13:44.412
JUST FIRE. SO THEY DON'T DO THE

03:13:44.479 --> 03:13:46.448
REPORT I GOT BACK IS A

03:13:46.514 --> 03:13:47.649
CONVOLUTED REPORT IT TALKS

03:13:47.716 --> 03:13:50.785
ABOUT. I WANTED. SO BASICALLY I

03:13:50.852 --> 03:13:51.920
HAVE NOT GIVEN UP ON THE SIDE I

03:13:51.987 --> 03:13:53.021
THINK IT'S A RIGHTEOUS THING TO

03:13:53.088 --> 03:13:54.990
DO I THINK WE SHOULD. COUNT FOR

03:13:55.056 --> 03:13:56.925
I'M NOT ASKING US TO FIND

03:13:56.992 --> 03:13:58.159
SOMETHING I'M NOT ASKING FOR US

03:13:58.226 --> 03:14:01.796
TO. TO TAKE ANY R. G. G. R. F.

03:14:01.863 --> 03:14:02.397
FUNDS I STRIPPED ALL THAT ALL

03:14:02.464 --> 03:14:04.032
THE BILL. DO I THINK WE SHOULD

03:14:04.099 --> 03:14:05.233
SPEND MORE RESOURCE ARE

03:14:05.300 --> 03:14:06.468
ABSOLUTELY AND WE DIDN'T GET

03:14:06.534 --> 03:14:08.269
THAT DONE WE DID DO THAT AND I

03:14:08.336 --> 03:14:09.104
DON'T WANT WE PUT RESOURCES IN

03:14:09.170 --> 03:14:11.539
THERE. BUT SIMPLY THE FACT IS

03:14:11.606 --> 03:14:13.475
THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HUMAN

03:14:13.541 --> 03:14:18.480
BECAUSE. AND NATURAL. YOU'VE I

03:14:18.546 --> 03:14:20.715
KNOW THAT. SENATOR ALAN CENTER

03:14:20.782 --> 03:14:21.750
SKINNER HAVE BEEN ON THE

03:14:21.816 --> 03:14:23.451
FORESTRY TOURISM BEEN OUT THERE

03:14:23.518 --> 03:14:25.086
TO SEE. ON THE GROUND AND I

03:14:25.153 --> 03:14:27.122
KNOW THAT SUNDERLAND GONZALEZ

03:14:27.188 --> 03:14:28.356
IS HOPEFULLY COMING WITH ME

03:14:28.423 --> 03:14:32.560
SOON- WE CAUSE THE PROBLEM

03:14:32.627 --> 03:14:33.661
THAT'S THE POINT WE TALK ABOUT

03:14:33.728 --> 03:14:34.896
HUMAN BECAUSE YES THERE'S

03:14:34.963 --> 03:14:36.631
DIFFERENT TYPES OF IGNITION

03:14:36.698 --> 03:14:38.900
THAT HAPPENED BY HUMANS WHICH

03:14:38.967 --> 03:14:41.236
IS EITHER TRANSMISSION LINES OR-

03:14:41.302 --> 03:14:44.406
VEHICLES OR ARSON. BUT THE

03:14:44.472 --> 03:14:46.174
RESOURCE ITSELF IS BEING

03:14:46.241 --> 03:14:47.709
MANIPULATED FOR OVER THE LAST

03:14:47.776 --> 03:14:49.944
HUNDRED YEARS BY MAN. IT'S NOT

03:14:50.011 --> 03:14:52.781
IN ITS NATURAL STATE. SO WHEN

03:14:52.847 --> 03:14:54.249
WE WANT TO IF WE WANT TO HAVE

03:14:54.315 --> 03:14:56.851
THE DEBATE ABOUT. WHAT THE

03:14:56.918 --> 03:14:58.119
RESORT WHAT HOW MUCH EMISSIONS

03:14:58.186 --> 03:14:59.387
ARE GONNA COME UPWHAT WOULD BE

03:14:59.454 --> 03:15:01.589
NATURALLY STORED WHAT WHAT IS

03:15:01.656 --> 03:15:03.024
WHAT IS THAT BASS LINE WHICH I

03:15:03.091 --> 03:15:05.226
THINK WHAT CENTER ALAN'S TALK

03:15:05.293 --> 03:15:05.827
ABOUT THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO

03:15:05.894 --> 03:15:08.963
A STUDY. HE YOU WE ASKED THEM

03:15:09.030 --> 03:15:09.764
TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THEY

03:15:09.831 --> 03:15:10.565
GAVE ME IF YOU LOOK AT THE

03:15:10.632 --> 03:15:12.901
REPORT TO COME FROM. A. R. B.

03:15:12.967 --> 03:15:14.903
IT'S PRETTY BENIGN AND PARTY

03:15:14.969 --> 03:15:16.571
GENERAL AND NOT DOESN'T TALK

03:15:16.638 --> 03:15:18.406
ABOUT WHAT THE- HUMAN CALL

03:15:18.473 --> 03:15:20.775
HUMAN. INTERACTION WITH THE-

03:15:20.842 --> 03:15:23.244
LAND HAS BEEN SO. THE REASON

03:15:23.311 --> 03:15:24.579
FOR THIS BILL IS TO SAY THAT WE

03:15:24.646 --> 03:15:26.147
PUT IN THIS POSITION. THERE'S

03:15:26.214 --> 03:15:27.549
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT NOT I'M NOT

03:15:27.615 --> 03:15:29.050
DENYING THAT. THE CLIMATE'S

03:15:29.117 --> 03:15:31.853
WARMING. BUT WEEK WE CAUSED.

03:15:31.920 --> 03:15:34.656
THE TO MEET THERE'S TOO MANY.

03:15:34.722 --> 03:15:36.691
TOO MUCH FUEL. WHETHER IT'S IN

03:15:36.758 --> 03:15:38.093
TREES OR BRUSH THERE'S TOO MUCH

03:15:38.159 --> 03:15:38.893
FEELS AND WE NEED TO PUT IT

03:15:38.960 --> 03:15:40.762
BACK IN THE STATE WORK FIRE CAN

03:15:40.829 --> 03:15:41.763
ACTUALLY GO INTO THE-

03:15:41.830 --> 03:15:43.998
LANDSCAPE. AND BE LEFT ALONE

03:15:44.065 --> 03:15:44.632
AND DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO

03:15:44.699 --> 03:15:47.202
WHICH IS. MOSAE CLEBURNE TO THE

03:15:47.268 --> 03:15:49.471
FOREST AND WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF

03:15:49.537 --> 03:15:51.439
DATA. THAT SHOWS US WHAT IT WAS

03:15:51.506 --> 03:15:53.074
LIKE BEFORE WE MESSED WITH IT.

03:15:53.141 --> 03:15:54.909
BEFORE WE EITHER CUT IT DOWN

03:15:54.976 --> 03:15:56.177
AND LET IT GROW BACK AND THEN

03:15:56.244 --> 03:15:57.445
STOPPED ALL THE FIRE OR

03:15:57.512 --> 03:15:58.213
WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE PAST

03:15:58.279 --> 03:16:00.048
BUT I CAN TELL YOU. WHAT DID

03:16:00.115 --> 03:16:01.282
HAPPEN IN THE PAST WAS WE'VE

03:16:01.349 --> 03:16:03.318
MANIPULATED SO. THAT'S THE

03:16:03.384 --> 03:16:04.586
REASON BEHIND THIS BILL IS TO

03:16:04.652 --> 03:16:07.255
JUST GET THAT QUANTITY. TO TALK

03:16:07.322 --> 03:16:08.857
ABOUT HATE LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE

03:16:08.923 --> 03:16:12.827
DOING. ON FIRE. AND SKEWS ME I

03:16:12.894 --> 03:16:15.563
RAN A BILL TO DO. THE ANALYSIS

03:16:15.630 --> 03:16:17.699
FOR CREEK FOR WILDLIFE. THAT

03:16:17.765 --> 03:16:18.666
BILLS ACTUALLY WORKING THROUGH

03:16:18.733 --> 03:16:19.901
THE PROCESS WHICH I KNOW WHAT A

03:16:19.968 --> 03:16:21.603
PROBABLY GET HELD UP. IN

03:16:21.669 --> 03:16:23.404
APPROACH BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO

03:16:23.471 --> 03:16:24.005
TAKE SOME MONEY BECAUSE I WANT

03:16:24.072 --> 03:16:25.707
TO KNOW. WHAT THE KNOWLEDGE

03:16:25.773 --> 03:16:27.709
THIS SO IT'S I'VE BEEN I'VE

03:16:27.775 --> 03:16:29.944
BEEN WORKING ON THIS WATERSHED.

03:16:30.011 --> 03:16:33.448
CARBON APPROACH TO WILDLIFE TO

03:16:33.515 --> 03:16:35.817
OUR TO OUR WATER SEQUESTRATION

03:16:35.884 --> 03:16:37.986
IN THE FOREST AND TO THE CARBON

03:16:38.052 --> 03:16:39.420
OUTPUT SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE

03:16:39.487 --> 03:16:41.122
THE THREE THE THREE LEGS OF

03:16:41.189 --> 03:16:43.024
WHAT I THINK SHOULD HAPPEN WE

03:16:43.091 --> 03:16:44.325
CAN WE DEBATE ALL DAY LONG

03:16:44.392 --> 03:16:46.561
ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD SPEND THE

03:16:46.628 --> 03:16:47.162
MONEY IN WHERE WE- WERE OR THE

03:16:47.228 --> 03:16:49.697
RIGHT PLACES ARE. BUT I THINK

03:16:49.764 --> 03:16:51.399
IT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MY

03:16:51.466 --> 03:16:53.234
PHILOSOPHY AND SOME OTHERS IS

03:16:53.301 --> 03:16:56.437
HOW WE GET THERE. WEEK WE CAN

03:16:56.504 --> 03:16:58.273
REGULATE THE HECK OUT OF.

03:16:58.339 --> 03:16:59.841
INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE GOT WE HAVE

03:16:59.908 --> 03:17:02.410
A SOURCE WE KNOW RIGHT WORDS

03:17:02.477 --> 03:17:03.011
COMING FROM AND WE KNOW THAT

03:17:03.077 --> 03:17:05.213
WE'VE ACTUALLY TAKEN. CARBON

03:17:05.280 --> 03:17:06.314
OUT OF THE GROUND AND WERE

03:17:06.381 --> 03:17:08.616
MEDICARE. DEBATE BUT IN THIS

03:17:08.683 --> 03:17:11.152
CASE WE'VE STORED MORE CARBON

03:17:11.219 --> 03:17:11.753
IN OUR HAVING MASSEY RELEASES

03:17:11.819 --> 03:17:14.455
OF IT. SO HOW DO WE GET HOW DO

03:17:14.522 --> 03:17:16.424
WE ACTUALLY MANAGE THAT IN A

03:17:16.491 --> 03:17:17.025
WAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE

03:17:17.091 --> 03:17:19.060
MASSIVE RELEASES. AND WE

03:17:19.127 --> 03:17:21.796
ACTUALLY GO IN AND DO THE RIGHT

03:17:21.863 --> 03:17:22.397
TO HATE WHICH IS STILL IN THE

03:17:22.463 --> 03:17:24.532
DARK FORCED. AND THEN LET FIRE

03:17:24.599 --> 03:17:25.667
DO WHAT IT DOES AND I RAN I

03:17:25.733 --> 03:17:27.602
I'VE CHAMPION BILL AFTER BILL

03:17:27.669 --> 03:17:28.736
TO TRY TO GET THERE AND I

03:17:28.803 --> 03:17:29.837
ALWAYS HAVE OPPOSITION FROM

03:17:29.904 --> 03:17:31.206
THIS PERSON THAT DOESN'T WANT

03:17:31.272 --> 03:17:33.508
TO CUT A TREE AND THAT PERSON

03:17:33.575 --> 03:17:34.509
THAT. IS LIKE. THE LEVEL OF

03:17:34.576 --> 03:17:36.010
FRUSTRATION IS VERY HIGH AS YOU

03:17:36.077 --> 03:17:37.378
CAN SEE SO I HOPE I ANSWERED

03:17:37.445 --> 03:17:39.814
YOUR QUESTION. THE ONLY THING

03:17:39.881 --> 03:17:40.815
THAT I WAS REALLY AND I KNOW I

03:17:40.882 --> 03:17:43.718
APPRECIATE- YOUR EXPLANATION I

03:17:43.785 --> 03:17:44.752
JUST WAS TRYING TO. UNDERSTAND

03:17:44.819 --> 03:17:47.255
WHY. YOU KNOW IT IT SEEMED TO

03:17:47.322 --> 03:17:50.558
ME THAT. THE WHILE THE

03:17:50.625 --> 03:17:52.460
AMENDMENTS DID NOT ACHIEVE ALL

03:17:52.527 --> 03:17:54.796
OF YOUR GOALS. THAT IT DID MOVE

03:17:54.862 --> 03:17:57.265
THE BALL FORWARD AND DID. WOULD

03:17:57.332 --> 03:17:58.866
PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME OF THE

03:17:58.933 --> 03:18:00.602
INFORMATION YOU WANTED NOT

03:18:00.668 --> 03:18:02.170
PERHAPS IN THE WAY YOU. THE WAY

03:18:02.237 --> 03:18:05.073
YOU HAD HOPED. BUT THAT'S WHY I

03:18:05.139 --> 03:18:06.674
WONDERED IF YOU WHY. YOU ARE

03:18:06.741 --> 03:18:07.875
NOT WILLING TO TAKE ALL THE

03:18:07.942 --> 03:18:08.943
COMMITTEES MINUTES BECAUSE I

TREE. AND SAY THAT WE HAVE TO

03:19:57.185 --> 03:19:59.754
NOW REGULATED TREE. LIKE WE

AWKWARD FIT SO YOU KNOW IF WE

03:20:09.330 --> 03:20:10.832

ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES THESE

03:20:12.500 --> 03:20:14.635
SORT OF NATURAL THESE NATURE

03:20:14.702 --> 03:20:17.405
BASED SOURCES. TO OUR SCOPING

03:20:17.472 --> 03:20:20.208

THERE RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN NOW

03:20:23.010 --> 03:20:24.645
JUST REDUCE THE COMPLIANCE

03:20:24.712 --> 03:20:27.715
BURDEN ON THE REST OF THE STATE

03:20:27.782 --> 03:20:29.751
BY HALF SO YOU'VE TOLD CONTROL

03:20:29.817 --> 03:20:30.852
IN WHICH IS THE LARGEST SOURCE

03:20:30.918 --> 03:20:32.353
OF EMISSIONS IN THE STATE YOU

03:20:32.420 --> 03:20:34.122
KNOW IT. AFTER OBLIGATION HALF

03:20:34.188 --> 03:20:35.857
LET'S NOT WORRY BOUT PETROLEUM

03:20:35.923 --> 03:20:37.859
WE CAN HIT THE 40% BELOW

03:20:37.925 --> 03:20:38.960
NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS JUST BY

03:20:39.026 --> 03:20:40.661
ADDING THIS FOREST CARBON IN

03:20:40.728 --> 03:20:41.229
AND DOING SOME FORCE

03:20:41.295 --> 03:20:44.132
MANAGEMENT. IF THERE'S A WAY TO

03:20:44.198 --> 03:20:45.666
BUILD THESE EMISSIONS IN SO

03:20:45.733 --> 03:20:46.934
THAT YOU'RE NOT LETTING

03:20:47.001 --> 03:20:48.770
EVERYONE ELSE OFF THE HOOK FOR

03:20:48.836 --> 03:20:50.004
A VERY CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED

03:20:50.071 --> 03:20:52.106
AGREEMENT AROUND. OUR CLIMATE

03:20:52.173 --> 03:20:53.374
POLICIES IN THE STATE THAT WAS

03:20:53.441 --> 03:20:55.543
NEGOTIABLE I PARTISAN BASIS AND

03:20:55.610 --> 03:20:57.478
AS A HUGE INDUSTRY BEHIND IT.

03:20:57.545 --> 03:20:59.580
AND IT'S A IT'S A LOT TO JUST

03:20:59.647 --> 03:21:02.550
THROW IN THE WHOLE SOURCE THAT.

03:21:02.617 --> 03:21:06.654
ISN'T AGAIN IS A NATURE BASED

03:21:06.721 --> 03:21:08.356
SOURCE. THAT'S THE CAN. COURT

03:21:08.423 --> 03:21:09.624
HERE I THINK IF YOU HAD TO

03:21:09.690 --> 03:21:13.027
EITHER. A REQUIREMENT TO

03:21:13.094 --> 03:21:14.929
INCREASE THE ACTUAL EMISSIONS

03:21:14.996 --> 03:21:17.365
TARGET BY TWENTY THIRTY. WHICH

03:21:17.432 --> 03:21:18.666
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR OUR

03:21:18.733 --> 03:21:20.301
OUR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HAVE

03:21:20.368 --> 03:21:22.370
DONE THAT SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO-

03:21:22.437 --> 03:21:25.506
BUT THAT THAT 80% TARGET WOULD

03:21:25.573 --> 03:21:27.842
ALLOW FOR SPACE FOR THIS KIND

03:21:27.909 --> 03:21:29.844
OF FORCED REDUCE CARBON OR IF

03:21:29.911 --> 03:21:32.246
WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE TO GO MORE

03:21:32.313 --> 03:21:33.714
SENATOR SKINNER'S ROUTE AND

03:21:33.781 --> 03:21:35.950
HURT SB TWENTY SEVEN WHERE

03:21:36.017 --> 03:21:37.518
SHE'S ALSO TRYING TO GET. AN

03:21:37.585 --> 03:21:39.720
ACCURATE INVENTORY AND REALLY

03:21:39.787 --> 03:21:41.022
GET THE MATH DONE BEHIND

03:21:41.088 --> 03:21:42.790
NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS BUT

03:21:42.857 --> 03:21:44.992
NOT TRYING TO TREAT THAT AS A

03:21:45.059 --> 03:21:46.194
MARKET BASED COMPLIANCE

03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:47.962
MECHANISM FOR THE REST OF THE

03:21:48.029 --> 03:21:49.897
MANMADE EMISSIONS. THEN YOU

03:21:49.964 --> 03:21:52.500
WOULDN'T HAVE THE CONCERN THAT

03:21:52.567 --> 03:21:54.268
PEOPLE LIVING IN LONG BEACH ON

03:21:54.335 --> 03:21:56.270
THE SEVEN TEN CORRIDOR OR WHO

03:21:56.337 --> 03:21:57.839
WERE SUFFERING FROM POLLUTION

03:21:57.905 --> 03:21:59.574
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ARE

03:21:59.640 --> 03:22:01.209
SUDDENLY GOING TO HAVE TO SEVER

03:22:01.275 --> 03:22:02.410
JUST AS MUCH IF NOT MORE

03:22:02.477 --> 03:22:03.945
POLLUTION BECAUSE- WE STARTED

03:22:04.011 --> 03:22:06.614
COUNTING FORCE AND THAT OFFSETS

03:22:06.681 --> 03:22:08.683
ALL THAT OTHER POLLUTION. SO I

03:22:08.749 --> 03:22:10.785
THINK I MIGHT BE YOU KNOW IT'S

03:22:10.852 --> 03:22:13.421
PROBABLY TOO LATE TO ADD THAT

03:22:13.488 --> 03:22:15.156
KIND OF AMENDMENT OF AN 80%

03:22:15.223 --> 03:22:16.958
TARGET TO YOUR BILL OR TO TRY

03:22:17.024 --> 03:22:19.227
TO TAKE THESE EMISSIONS AND PUT

03:22:19.293 --> 03:22:19.861
THEM WHERE I THINK THEY BELONG

03:22:19.927 --> 03:22:22.196
WHICH IS IN A- COURT A NATURAL

03:22:22.263 --> 03:22:23.664
WORKING LANDS FRAMEWORK THE

03:22:23.731 --> 03:22:25.566
RESOURCE AGENCY COULD LOOK AT.

03:22:25.633 --> 03:22:29.403
IF. YOU'RE OPEN TO THAT- I

03:22:29.470 --> 03:22:30.137
THINK WE WERE COULD SOMETHING

03:22:30.204 --> 03:22:31.606
HERE AND MAYBE NOT TODAY BUT

03:22:31.672 --> 03:22:33.040
MAYBE THIS SESSION TO PUT THAT

03:22:33.107 --> 03:22:35.109
ALL TOGETHER BUT- IT'S TOO

03:22:35.176 --> 03:22:36.677
NARROW TO SIMPLY SAY NO NO

03:22:36.744 --> 03:22:38.412
WE'RE TRYING TO IGNORE. THOSE

03:22:38.479 --> 03:22:41.048
EMISSIONS- AND YOU'RE NOT

03:22:41.115 --> 03:22:41.816
PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS A. R.

03:22:41.883 --> 03:22:43.751
B. A. R. B. IS PAYING ATTENTION

03:22:43.818 --> 03:22:45.052
TO THE CHALLENGE WE SET BEFORE

03:22:45.119 --> 03:22:47.188
THEM WHICH IS TO GET 240% BELOW

03:22:47.255 --> 03:22:48.422
NINETEEN NINETY. OF

03:22:48.489 --> 03:22:49.423
ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS IN THE

03:22:49.490 --> 03:22:51.058
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE WANNA

03:22:51.125 --> 03:22:52.760
DOUBLE THAT THE LET'S DOUBLE

03:22:52.827 --> 03:22:54.629
OUR COMMITMENT. SO I'M UP FOR

03:22:54.695 --> 03:22:56.030
IF YOU WANT TO ADD THAT TO THE

03:22:56.097 --> 03:22:57.698
BILL I'D BE GLAD TO SUPPORT IT

03:22:57.765 --> 03:22:58.599

03:23:03.170 --> 03:23:06.140
TO JUST HAVE AN APPLES TO

03:23:06.207 --> 03:23:06.707
APPLES KIND OF CONVERSATION

03:23:06.774 --> 03:23:08.242

THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL.

03:23:12.213 --> 03:23:14.081
ANALYSIS BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE

03:23:14.148 --> 03:23:16.551
ONE COMMENT. THE CLIMATE

03:23:16.617 --> 03:23:18.052
DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU

03:23:18.119 --> 03:23:20.655

03:23:20.721 --> 03:23:22.423
GROUND OR YOU MINUTES SOMEWHERE

03:23:22.490 --> 03:23:23.558
IT DOESN'T MATTER AT THE END OF

03:23:23.624 --> 03:23:25.459
THE DAY YOU STILL HAVE A CALL

03:23:25.526 --> 03:23:27.161
USED TO HAVE A CARBON PROBLEM.

03:23:27.228 --> 03:23:28.529
WHETHER YOU WHETHER YOU HAVE A

03:23:28.596 --> 03:23:29.797
SOURCE FOR FUNDING OR NOT OR

03:23:29.864 --> 03:23:31.032
SORCERY WANNA LET SOMEBODY OFF

03:23:31.098 --> 03:23:33.000
THE HOOK OR NOT IT ENDED TODAY

03:23:33.067 --> 03:23:35.469
HI I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY-

03:23:35.536 --> 03:23:37.204
INTERESTING THAT TO THE EPA

03:23:37.271 --> 03:23:38.606
DIRECTOR SAID HE WAS WITH THE

03:23:38.673 --> 03:23:40.308
GOVERNOR IN SAN FRANCISCO AND

03:23:40.374 --> 03:23:41.909
THE SKY WAS ORANGE IT WASN'T

03:23:41.976 --> 03:23:43.344
FROM CARS. IT WAS FROM THE

03:23:43.411 --> 03:23:46.514
FORCED BURNING THE HECK DOWN SO

03:23:46.581 --> 03:23:48.082
LOOK I'M I KNOW I'M NOT GOING

03:23:48.149 --> 03:23:50.885
TO GET THIS BILL OUT HERE TODAY

03:23:50.952 --> 03:23:52.520
BUT I CHALLENGES. BY CHALLENGES

03:23:52.587 --> 03:23:53.421
EVERY MEMBER OF THIS

03:23:53.487 --> 03:23:56.057
LEGISLATURE. TO HELP ME FIGURE

03:23:56.123 --> 03:23:57.191
OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

03:23:57.258 --> 03:23:58.426
DO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:23:58.492 --> 03:23:59.994
DONE BECAUSE IF YOU TRULY CARE

03:24:00.061 --> 03:24:02.430
ABOUT THE DARN CLIMATE. CAN YOU

03:24:02.496 --> 03:24:05.733
REALLY WATCH OUR WATERSHEDS GET

03:24:05.800 --> 03:24:08.803
DESTROYED. CAN WE REALLY IT'S

03:24:08.869 --> 03:24:11.806
BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION THAT WE

03:24:11.872 --> 03:24:14.442
FOCUS ON SOME OF THE THINGS

03:24:14.508 --> 03:24:16.877
THAT ARE. AND THERE'S THIS

03:24:16.944 --> 03:24:18.512
THERE'S THIS GIANT OUTPUT IT'S

03:24:18.579 --> 03:24:20.281
LIKE FOR ME IT'S LIKE DOESN'T

03:24:20.348 --> 03:24:21.682
MAKE SENSE AND AS I SAID

03:24:21.749 --> 03:24:23.584
EARLIER I'VE TRIED ALL AYE

03:24:23.651 --> 03:24:25.086
BRAND BUILT TO TRY TO. CORRECT

03:24:25.152 --> 03:24:26.621
THE REGULATE REGULATORY

03:24:26.687 --> 03:24:28.089
PROCESSES. IN THE FORCE TO GET

03:24:28.155 --> 03:24:31.325
US TO DO IT. ON ON WITH ITS

03:24:31.392 --> 03:24:34.829
OWN- PAYMENT SCHEDULE BUT I

03:24:34.895 --> 03:24:36.263
JUST WOULD SAY THAT IN AND THE

03:24:36.330 --> 03:24:38.332
OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO ADD

03:24:38.399 --> 03:24:40.301
IS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:24:40.368 --> 03:24:42.269
IS NOT AT THE TABLE. WHICH IS

03:24:42.336 --> 03:24:45.439
VERY FRUSTRATING THEY HAVE 60%

03:24:45.506 --> 03:24:46.974
OF THE OF THE LAND MASS IN

03:24:47.041 --> 03:24:48.743
CALIFORNIA IS OWNED BY THE

03:24:48.809 --> 03:24:50.878
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS OUR

03:24:50.945 --> 03:24:53.180
WATERSHED. ARE WILDLIFE. AND WE

03:24:53.247 --> 03:24:54.315
DON'T WE DON'T WE ARE NOT THE

03:24:54.382 --> 03:24:56.250
TABLE AT ALL AND YOU KNOW. I

03:24:56.317 --> 03:24:58.219
WENT OFF ON TRUMP'S SITTING

03:24:58.285 --> 03:24:59.387
WHEN HE SAID YOU KNOW

03:24:59.453 --> 03:25:00.421
CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEMS ARE

03:25:00.488 --> 03:25:01.989
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA DOESN'T DO

03:25:02.056 --> 03:25:03.858
THE RIGHT THING INFO AND TRY TO

03:25:03.924 --> 03:25:05.593
BLAME GOVERNOR NEWSOM NOW.

BUDDY YOU REPRESENT 60% OF IT

03:25:08.596 --> 03:25:09.530
AND YOU'RE NOT MANAGING YOUR

03:25:09.597 --> 03:25:13.601
LAND AT ALL AND IT'S DISGUSTING.

THAT INITIATED THE N. A. I. C.

03:51:05.418 --> 03:51:06.819

INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS FROM

03:51:16.629 --> 03:51:19.098
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND THE

03:51:19.165 --> 03:51:20.633
MAIN RISK MODELLERS IN THIS

03:51:20.700 --> 03:51:23.102
FIELD TO TRY TO GET THE ENERGY

03:51:23.169 --> 03:51:25.638
TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS AND IT

03:51:25.705 --> 03:51:27.773

LATER BEGAN TO PUT SOME THINGS

03:51:35.781 --> 03:51:37.717
INTO PLACE AND STILL NOT THE

03:51:37.783 --> 03:51:39.652
TYPE OF COMPREHENSIVE

03:51:39.719 --> 03:51:41.887
