WORKED ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND

00:36:28.853 --> 00:36:30.087
I THINK THIS SUBCOMMITTEE

00:36:30.154 --> 00:36:32.757
GENERALLY SHARES A CONCERN --

00:36:32.823 --> 00:36:34.492
ABOUT THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:37.228
IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY --

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:39.363
AND SOME PARTS OF OUR STATE.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.566
RESIDENTS ARE A LIVING IN

00:36:41.632 --> 00:36:43.401
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN IT RELATES TO

00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:45.303
WATER -- THAT IS MUCH LIKE

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:46.938
DEVELOPING NATIONS THERE ARE IN

00:36:47.004 --> 00:36:47.772
FACT.

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:49.106
OVER THREE HUNDRED ON SAFE

00:36:49.173 --> 00:36:50.575
DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS ACROSS

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:51.709
THE STATE.

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:53.110
AND VIRTUALLY EVERY COUNTY IN

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:55.212
CALIFORNIA CONTAINS A SOME

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:56.314
IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.448
RESIDENTS.

00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:59.984
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY -- AN

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:01.586
ESTIMATED ONE MILLION

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:03.421
CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE

00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:04.922
ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER.

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:06.891
AND THEREFORE RELY ON PURCHASING

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:09.393
WATER AND HAULING IT INTO THEIR

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.796
HOMES -- THAT'S JUST --

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:14.131
UNFATHOMABLE A IN THIS DAY AND

00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:16.067
AGE AND SO WE NEED A SUSTAINABLE

00:37:16.133 --> 00:37:17.635
FRAMEWORK TO PERMANENTLY SOLVE

00:37:17.702 --> 00:37:18.603
THE CRISIS.

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:20.504
THERE ARE SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE

00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:21.405
MEASURES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

00:37:21.472 --> 00:37:23.240
UNDER CONSIDERATION I AM THE

00:37:23.307 --> 00:37:26.110
AUTHOR OF ONE OF THEM -- BUT AS

00:37:26.177 --> 00:37:27.645

PROGRAM -- TO THE POLICY PROCESS

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:35.086
TO ALLOW THOSE BILLS TO MOVE

00:37:35.152 --> 00:37:38.122
FORWARD -- BUT I DO WANT TO

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:41.759
REITERATE MY OF A CONCERN THAT

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:43.694
WE HAVE NOT YET RESOLVED THIS

00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:47.932
ISSUE AND AND WE MUST.

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:49.100
WE HAVE THREE BUDGET REQUEST

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.835
REGARDING WILDFIRES IN UTILITIES

00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:52.903
THAT WILL TAKE ACTIONS ON THAT

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.071
REFLECT OUR CONCERNS ABOUT

00:37:54.138 --> 00:37:55.539
APPROVING FUNDING FOR NEW

00:37:55.606 --> 00:37:58.676
ACTIVITIES ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:00.478
FOR THE DMV WE ADOPT A MOTOR

00:38:00.544 --> 00:38:01.912
VEHICLE ACCOUNT PLAN THAT

00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:03.614
ENSURES THE FUND BALANCE REMAINS

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:05.416
HEALTHY AND IS ABLE TO FUND OUR

00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:07.818
PRIORITIES. FOR THE DMV BUDGET

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.587
REQUEST FOR FUNDING TO IMPROVE

00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:11.689
ITS OVERALL OPERATIONS WE TAKE

00:38:11.756 --> 00:38:13.057
ACTIONS THAT WILL HOLD THE DMV

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:15.993
ACCOUNTABLE FOR APPROVING A FOR

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.528
IMPROVING ITS PERFORMANCE.

00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:20.331
AND FINALLY FOR CAP AND TRADE WE

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:22.333
ARE ADOPTING AN EXPENDITURE PLAN

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.868
THAT REFLECTS OUR HIGH LEVEL

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:25.770
PRIORITIES IT DOESN'T GET INTO

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:27.605
QUITE THE DETAIL THAT -- WE'RE

00:38:27.672 --> 00:38:30.441
ALL USED -- TO FROM PASS BUDGETS

00:38:30.508 --> 00:38:31.575
BUT I THINK THIS IS GOING TO

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.544
ALLOW US TO FOCUS ON THE HIGH

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:35.179
LEVEL PRIORITIES.

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:38.082
AND THE OF COURSE SO WILL

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:39.917
CONTINUE WITHIN THOSE HIGH LEVEL

00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:42.720

DIVERSITY ASSESSMENT TODAY.

00:42:39.556 --> 00:42:41.692
AND THESE FINDINGS WERE WENT FAR

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:43.027
BEYOND SOBERING.

00:42:43.093 --> 00:42:44.962
AN ESTIMATED ONE MILLION ANIMAL

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:46.430
AND PLANT SPECIES ON THE VERGE

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:47.865
OF EXTINCTION.

00:42:47.932 --> 00:42:50.501
AND THESE UNPARALLELED LOSSES.

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:52.569
I'M IN HUMAN HISTORY ARE DUE TO

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:54.672
HUMAN ACTIVITY ON A QUICKLY

00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:56.907
WARMING CLIMATE HABITAT LOSS

00:42:56.974 --> 00:42:58.575
POLLUTION AND MORE HAVE BEEN THE

00:42:58.642 --> 00:43:01.378
CAUSE OF THOSE TRIED BOXES.

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:02.579
CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO ONE OF THE

00:43:02.646 --> 00:43:04.615
PLANET'S BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS

00:43:04.682 --> 00:43:06.116
ONE OF THIRTY FIVE OF THEM.

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:07.618
YEAH UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE MORE

00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:18.262
MORE.

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:20.464
I'M HERE TODAY AS A SCIENTIST ON

00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:22.566

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:44.655
THE FIELD OF CONSERVATION

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:46.457
GENOMICS ALLOW SCIENTISTS TO

00:43:46.523 --> 00:43:48.792
IDENTIFY SPECIES AND POPULATIONS

00:43:48.859 --> 00:43:50.327
THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:51.528
HABITAT LOSS.

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:54.965

[inaudible]

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:57.401
THESE POPULATIONS THOSE

00:43:57.468 --> 00:43:59.336
POPULATIONS WITH THE GREATEST

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:01.238
GENETIC VARIABILITY ARE FAR MORE

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:02.940
LIKELY TO ADAPT TO ADVERSE

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:04.041
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:06.410
THESE TOOLS ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY.

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:09.513
ON THOSE RESILIENT POPULATIONS.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.315
TO DATE YOU SEE SCIENTISTS.

00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:12.883
