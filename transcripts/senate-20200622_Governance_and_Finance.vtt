00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.797
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO FOR

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:13.166
BLACK AND LATINO FAMILIES

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:15.034
HISTORICALLY. BANKS AND

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.669
EMPLOYERS EXCLUDED THEM FROM

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:18.604
TRADITIONAL MEANS OF BUILDING

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:20.273
AN INTER GENERATIONAL WEALTH

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.175
RACISM AND PREJUDICE MADE IT

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:24.377
HARDER FOR MANY TO INVEST. OR

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:27.280
OWN ASSETS PROPERTY AND OTHER

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:29.849
ITEMS THIS IS THE IS VISIBLE

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:31.350
TODAY IN THE DISPARITIES

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:33.419
BETWEEN THE AVERAGE BLACK AN

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:35.021
AVERAGE WHITE FAMILY INCOME

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:36.923
AVERAGE WHITE HOUSE SOLD HAS

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:39.692
TEN TIMES. MORE WEALTH THAN

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.527
AVERAGE BLACK COAT ALSO- LATINO

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:43.796
HOUSE SO WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:45.097
FORECLOSURE OF RENTAL

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:46.232
PROPERTIES WOULD MOM AND POP

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.935
OWNERS- CAN. EXACERBATE THIS

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:50.536
PROBLEM THIS IS NOT ONLY BAD

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:52.371
FOR TENANTS AND LANDLORDS BUT

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:53.840
IT'S ALSO BAD FOR EQUITY IN OUR

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:55.541
ECONOMY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:57.343
HOUSING EQUATION MANY TENANTS

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.579
AND LANDLORDS ARE NOW

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:00.780
STRUGGLING. THE IS THE ONLY

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:02.815
PROPOSAL I'M AWARE OF THAT

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:03.616
PROTECTS BOTH SIDES OF THE

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:05.384
EQUATION WHILE PROTECTING OUR

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.720
GENERAL FUND AS WELL. IT IS IT

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:09.488
DOES SO BECAUSE TENANTS MUST

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:12.558
REPAY MISS RENT IF THEY CAN.

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:14.727
AND THE TAX CREDITS WILL START

RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS THIS IS

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:22.768
NOT. A SMALL PROPOSAL BUT THIS

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.470

HELP TRIP ADDRESS THOSE ARE

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.107
MOST IN NEED. HIS REASON

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.710
BECAUSE NO PARTICIPANT WILL

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:31.244

BRADFORD IS THE CO CHAIR. OF

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:46.865
THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY EFFORT.

00:27:46.931 --> 00:27:49.367
LED BY THE PRO TEM AND THAT

00:27:49.434 --> 00:27:51.169
THIS IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT

00:27:51.236 --> 00:27:53.671
IDEAS THAT IS BEING FORMED OR

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:57.542
THAT GROUP. AND I WANT TO SAY

00:27:57.609 --> 00:27:59.978
THAT IT'S A BALANCE IN MANY

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:04.082
RESPECTS AS WE FACE. NOT JUST

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:07.318
THE PANDEMIC. BUT THE ECONOMIC

00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:09.487
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT PANDEMIC.

00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:11.156
BOTH WITH RESPECT TO KEEPING

00:28:11.222 --> 00:28:12.690
PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:15.093
ON THE ONE HAND. AT THE FIGURE

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.861
OUT HOW TO CREATIVELY CREATE

00:28:16.928 --> 00:28:18.596
RESOURCES BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THE

00:28:18.663 --> 00:28:20.598
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE DON'T

00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:22.600
HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRINT MONEY

00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:25.070
BUT THE NOTION IS THAT HOW DO

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:25.970
YOU DO THIS WHERE YOU CAN

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:27.472
CREATE DEBT RELIEF BUT WITHOUT

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.541
PUTTING ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:31.976
THE BUDGET THAT IS REQUIRED. TO

00:28:32.043 --> 00:28:33.378
PAY FOR SO MANY THINGS FROM

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:35.947
EDUCATION TO THE ARRAY OF

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:37.549
SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED.

00:28:37.615 --> 00:28:39.350
THAT'S THE TEST THAT WHICH

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:41.953
INFORMS OUR THINKING. IAN THE

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.887
ARE COMING UP WITH ECONOMIC

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:44.589
RECOVERY KEEPING PEOPLE FROM

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.357
BEING HOMELESS. AND YET BEING

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:48.093
THOUGHTFUL IN TRYING TO COME UP

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:50.395
WITH A SOLUTION. NUMBER ONE IS

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:51.729
THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH

00:28:51.796 --> 00:28:54.065
RESPECT TO THE OPPOSITION. THAT

00:28:54.132 --> 00:28:56.267
SEEMS TO BE MISSING HERE. IS

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:58.503
THAT THE TAX CREDITS ARE SIMPLY

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.139
A MECHANISM THAT THAT WAS TO

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:04.175
DEVISE TEAR. TO LESSEN THE

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:05.877
BURDEN ON CURRENT BUDGET AND

00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:07.779
GIVE US HEADROOM TO BE ABLE TO

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:10.348
GET THE RECOVERY IN FOR THE

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:12.016
NEXT THREE YEARS. LANDLORDS

00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:14.152
CONSOLE THOSE THEIR MISCIBLE

00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:16.154
SECURITIES THEIR COMMERCIAL

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:18.223
PAPER. THE ONLY QUESTION IS

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:20.425
WHAT'S THE DISCOUNT. UNDER THE

00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:22.093
TERMS OF THE BILL IT SAYS YOU

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.329
CAN START SELLING THEM IN

00:29:24.395 --> 00:29:25.463
TWENTY THEIR VALUABLE TWENTY

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.565
TWENTY FOUR. ALL ONE HAS TO DO

00:29:27.632 --> 00:29:28.633
IS LOOK AT THE MARKETS IN TERMS

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.401
WITH THE DISCOUNT RATES ARE

00:29:30.468 --> 00:29:34.005
TODAY WE KNOW THAT A- TREASURY

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:35.206
SIXTEEN BASIS POINTS WHICH IS A

00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:36.107
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN ONE TENTH

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:39.377
OF 1% WE KNOW THAT. THAT A- IF

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.279
SOMEBODY WANTED TO BUY A CD FOR

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:42.847
A YEAR IT'S ABOUT 1% SO WE KNOW

00:29:42.914 --> 00:29:44.682
INTEREST RATES ARE REALLY LOW.

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:46.317
RIGHT CENTER CONVEYANCE EXACTLY

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:48.753
CORRECT. SO THE DISCOUNT WILL

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.989
BE SMALL SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS

00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:53.825
THE LANDLORD IF THEY NEED THE

00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:55.760
CASH TO PAY THEIR BILLS. THAT

00:29:55.827 --> 00:29:56.794
WAS THE THEORY BEHIND THIS

00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:58.530
COMPROMISE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

00:29:58.596 --> 00:30:00.498
IN THIS ECONOMIC RECOVERY

00:30:00.565 --> 00:30:01.232
EFFORTS CENTER BRAD FOR YOU

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:03.067
SHOULD KNOW. COULD SIMPLY SELL

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:04.869
THAT'S THAT MONEY AND PAY THE

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:07.005
MORTGAGE. OR ANY OTHER BILLS

00:30:07.071 --> 00:30:09.707
THE TO PAY TO STAY ALIVE. SO

00:30:09.774 --> 00:30:12.377
THAT SO THAT THAT. PROVIDES A

00:30:12.443 --> 00:30:16.381
LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY. AND OUR-

00:30:16.447 --> 00:30:17.715
TO PROTECT BOTH THE LANDLORD ON

00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:19.083
THE ONE HAND TO MAKE SURE THEY

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.818
GET SOME REVENUE. AND THEN ON

00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:23.454
THE OTHER HAND TO MAKE SURE THE

00:30:23.521 --> 00:30:25.089
TENET DOESN'T BECOME HOMELESS.

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:26.858
IT IS SENATOR CABALLERO TALKED

00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:28.993
ABOUT. THE IDEAS THIS IS NOT A

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.430
FREE LUNCH. THAT YOU GOT TO PAY

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:33.765
BACK THE LOAN. THAT THE LOAN

00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:34.832
SIX MONTHS DON'T TALK ABOUT A

00:30:34.899 --> 00:30:36.334
COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I MIGHT

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:37.335
WANT TO SUGGEST AS WE GO

00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:38.836
FORWARD THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:41.806
THAT CD MAYBE I MISTER COLLEGE

00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:43.975
EYES. GET BACK THE REST. WE'RE

00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:46.177
GONNA BE OUT IN THE NEAR TERM.

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:47.612
BUT IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE GOING

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:48.846
FORWARD YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB

00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:50.348
THERE'S A SCHEDULE INSIDE THAT

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:51.716
SET FORTH THE ANALYSIS IN THE

00:30:51.783 --> 00:30:53.351
BILL. THAT SAYS HERE'S WHAT YOU

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:54.886
HAVE TO PAY BACK IF YOU HAVE

00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:55.787
REAL ECONOMIC HARDSHIP YOU

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:57.455
WON'T. AND IF YOU HAVE THE

00:30:57.522 --> 00:30:58.957
MONEY YOU THEN GOT TO PAY IT

00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:00.725
BACK OVER TIME THIS IS A

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:02.694
BRIDGE. IT'S A BRIDGE WHICH

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.263
BASED UPON RESPONSIBILITY. IT'S

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:06.130
A BRIDGE BASED UPON THE

00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:09.634
ABILITY. OF BY THE GOVERNMENT

00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:11.402
TO TRY TO REDUCE ITS CURRENT

00:31:11.469 --> 00:31:12.870
DEMAND ON THE BUDGET SO WE

00:31:12.937 --> 00:31:14.339
DON'T. OTHERWISE HAVE A

00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:15.707
CATALYTIC EFFECT OF ALL THE

00:31:15.773 --> 00:31:17.842
OTHER THINGS ON THE BUDGET. IT

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:19.510
IS REALLY AN ELEGANT SOLUTION.

00:31:19.577 --> 00:31:21.713
IN MANY RESPECTS BECAUSE OF THE

00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:26.284
COMMERCIAL PAPER ASPECT. OF THE-

00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:28.052
FROM TAX CREDITS. AND I WOULD

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:30.355
ALSO SUGGEST AS THE FOLKS WHO

00:31:30.421 --> 00:31:31.089
OPPOSED IF YOU WOULD DO SOME

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:33.057
RESEARCH HE WILL FIND IS WE'VE

00:31:33.124 --> 00:31:34.626
DONE THIS IF YOU HOLD ON TO THE

00:31:34.692 --> 00:31:36.661
TAX CREDITS FOR YEAR. IF YOU

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:38.263
COULD AFFORD TO CAN'T THE JYSK

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:40.732
SOLEMN. YOU MIGHT GET EIGHTY

00:31:40.798 --> 00:31:41.866
CENTS ON THE DOLLAR SOMETHING

00:31:41.933 --> 00:31:43.968
LIKE THAT SO IF YOU GET A

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:44.569
HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE IF YOU

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:45.737
GET ELEVEN HER DOLLAR RENT. AND

00:31:45.803 --> 00:31:46.571
YOU GET A HUNDRED DOLLARS THE

00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:48.139
TENET AND EIGHT HER DOLLARS THE

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:49.507
SALE OF YOUR TAX CREDIT. YOU

00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:51.242
GET NINE HER DOLLARS INSTEAD OF

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:52.543
ELEVEN HER DOLLARS THAT UNIT.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.245
IT KEEPS YOU ALIVE. BUT IF YOU

00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:56.347
HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOLD ON TO

00:31:56.414 --> 00:31:58.583
IT. FOR A YEAR. IT APPEARS THAT

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.552
IT CONVERTS TO. CAPITAL GAINS.

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:03.421
TAX RATE GOES DOWN DRAMATICALLY

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:04.922
FROM ORDINARY INCOME OF WHAT

00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:06.958
YOU WOULD GET. AS INCOME. AS A

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:08.626
LANDLORDS CAPITAL GAINS NOW

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:09.694
THERE'S NO CAPITAL GAINS IN THE

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:10.828
STATE BUT THE FEDERAL

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:11.729
GOVERNMENT IS SIGNIFICANT

00:32:11.796 --> 00:32:13.965
SAVINGS. SO IF YOU FACTOR THAT

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:16.501
IN. THE REALITY IS. TIME VALUE

00:32:16.567 --> 00:32:18.202
OF MONEY PLUS THE CAPITAL GAINS

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:19.437
TREATMENT. YOU'RE ACTUALLY

00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:20.738
GONNA MAKE MORE MONEY. ALL YOU

00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:21.906
GOTTA DO IS GO TO YOUR ACCOUNT

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:24.509
AND FIND OUT IF YOU CAN AFFORD

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:25.443
IF YOU CAN'T DO YOU SELL IT.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:26.110
BUT I WANTED TO SAY A COUPLE OF

00:32:26.177 --> 00:32:29.580
THINGS NUMBER ONE. ZERO THIS OF

00:32:29.647 --> 00:32:31.849
THIS IDEA OF THE FOUR YEARS IS

00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:33.451
NOT HAVING ANYBODY TO HOLD ON

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:34.385
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HOLD ON

00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:35.887
YOU'RE GONNA JUST GET PAID YOU

00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:37.288
GET PAID A LITTLE BIT LESS BUT

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:37.822
YOU GET PAID MRE THAN YOU

00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:39.457
WOULD PAY. IF YOU HAD TO A

00:32:39.524 --> 00:32:41.159
VICTOR TENET THINK ABOUT THIS

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:42.327
FROM A SOCIETAL PERSPECTIVE I'M

00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:43.328
SORRY THIS IS A REALLY

00:32:43.394 --> 00:32:44.529
IMPORTANT ISSUE WE TALKED ABOUT

00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:45.697
SOME SORT OF GOES ALONG TO

00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:47.198
TERMS CAN BE TWO MORE MINUTES

00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:47.765
THREE MORE MINUTES PROBABLY

00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:51.302
TIMES THREE- BUT- EVENT. THE

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:53.404
NOTION IS THAT YOU DON'T WHAT'S

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:54.372
THE COST TO SOCIETY AND THE

00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:55.406
GOVERNMENT IF EVERYBODY GETS

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:58.643
THROWN OUT WHAT ARE WE DOING

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:59.210
THE FOLKS ON THE OTHER HAND

00:32:59.277 --> 00:32:59.844
RIGHT. SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:01.913
QUESTIONS ONE IT TALKS ABOUT

00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:03.648
HOW MUCH MONEY IS TO BE PAID

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:04.215
MAYBE THERE MIGHT BE SOME

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:06.017
CLARIFICATION ON THAT THE FACT

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:08.119
THAT THAT A- THE TEN IT

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:09.253
ACTUALLY HAS TO MAKE A SHOWING

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.888
THAT THEY HAVE A NEED. RIGHT I

00:33:10.955 --> 00:33:11.989
MEAN THAT'S THE APPARENT THING

00:33:12.056 --> 00:33:12.790
TALKING TO A NUMBER OF

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:14.392
LANDLORDS QUITE FRANKLY MOST

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:15.993
PEOPLE ARE PAYING THE RENTS BUT

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.328
IF YOU HAVE A NEED. AND YOU

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:18.663
REALLY IN TROUBLE WE GET TAKE

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:19.731
AREA TO MAKE SURE NOT PHONE

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:21.733
APPS THE MAYBE THE ISSUE OF THE

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:23.534
COLIN TERMS SHOWING INDEED.

00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:25.603
SECONDLY THAT I TALKED ABOUT

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:26.671
WAS CENTER BRADFORD ACTUALLY

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:29.574
THIS WEEKEND WOULD YOU GO. THE

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.209
NOTION IS THAT MAYBE YOU GOTTA

00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:32.610
MAKE SO THERE IS I'M SORRY.

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:34.479
MAYBE MAYBE YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE

00:33:34.545 --> 00:33:35.713
SOME LEVEL OF THE PAYMENT IF

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.115
YOU COULD REPORT FIFTY DOLLARS

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:39.484
MAYBE MAKE SOME PAYMENT. TO

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.420
MAKE THAT APPROACH. THIRTY IS.

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:43.921
THAT THE WAY THIS IS WRITTEN IT

00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:47.158
SAYS THAT THE LENGTH OF THE-

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:49.127
COLD WITH NINETEEN. URGENCY AND

00:33:49.193 --> 00:33:50.995
MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME DEFINITION

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:53.197
IT'S BLANK PLUS NUMBER MONTHS.

00:33:53.264 --> 00:33:54.399
MAYBE HAVE SOME CERTAINTY IN

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:55.666
TERMS OF FILLING UP THAT

00:33:55.733 --> 00:33:56.734
BLANKET STILL BLANK THAT

00:33:56.801 --> 00:33:58.336

00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:00.204
LITTLE BIT ATTENTION. AND

SIX SIX TO DO THIS. IS A

00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:40.011
QUESTION. BUT I JUST WANT TO

00:34:40.077 --> 00:34:41.512
SAY THAT THIS DOES DEAL WITH

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:43.247
THE VULNERABLE. IT DOES DEAL

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:45.216
WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TO

00:34:45.283 --> 00:34:46.617

ALL OF THE ISSUES TE- LAST

00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:06.237
THING I WANT TO SAY THAT IS

00:35:06.304 --> 00:35:08.372
WHERE I STARTED OUT WITH. IS

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:09.774
THAT THE EFFORT IT ECONOMIC

00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:11.776

THAT THEN CAUSE FURTHER

00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:36.167
PROBLEMS BUT THAT THE ECONOMIC

00:35:36.234 --> 00:35:38.302
RECOVERY MODEL GIVES A WINDOW

00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:39.770

BIG PICTURE WE HAVE A HUGE-

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:17.722
BREWING- PROBLEM IN TERMS OF

HIGHER. THAN HAD BEEN

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:41.245
ANTICIPATED. THAT IS NOT GOING

00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:44.048
TO LAST- BECAUSE THE BEGINNING

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:47.151
PEOPLE MAY HAVE. MORE SAVINGS

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:48.586

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:56.794
GOES ON. WE'RE GONNA SEE REAL

00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:57.762
PROBLEMS AND EVEN THOUGH WE'RE

00:39:57.828 --> 00:39:59.897
STARTING TO RE OPEN THE

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:02.399
UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL VERY HIGH

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:05.436
AND- IT THIS IS A AND THE LAST

00:40:05.503 --> 00:40:06.003
THING THAT WE NEED HERE IN

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.506
CALIFORNIA. IT IS TO TRY TO GET

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:08.939
BACK UP ON OUR FEET

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:10.708
ECONOMICALLY AT THE SAME TIME

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:12.443
THAT WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.311

EXTRAORDINARY DIED. BUT THAT'S

00:40:17.948 --> 00:40:19.750
NOT HOW YOU GET BACK UP ON YOUR

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:21.685
FEET ECONOMICALLY SO EVEN

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:23.487
THOUGH THIS MAY NOT BE A-

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:24.288
TRADITIONAL THING THE

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:25.823
GOVERNMENT DOES. THIS IS

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:29.393

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:58.956
ARE RENTERS I'M A CO AUTHOR OF

00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:00.624
THE VARIOUS BILLS ONE BY

00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:02.159
SOMEONE RETAIN ONE BY

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:06.730
ASSEMBLYMEMBER TO- TO PROVIDE

00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:07.832
STRONGER EVICTION PROTECTIONS.

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:08.465
YEAH AND I THINK THERE IS SOME

00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:09.700
GOOD IN THIS BILL IT'S A

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:11.435
CREATIVE APPROACH AND I.

00:41:11.502 --> 00:41:13.270
APPRECIATE THAT IT'S A

00:41:13.337 --> 00:41:15.539
VOLUNTARY. OFFER THE LANDLORDS

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:16.974
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT CAUSES

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:19.610
ME. SOME CONCERN BUT I ALSO

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:21.145
UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE FAMILY

00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:23.113
DOES NOT ENTER INTO IT. THERE

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.982
ARE SOME PROTECTION EVAN THEIR

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:28.185
OBJECTION PROTECTIONS FOR THE

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:29.520
TENANTS OF THAT IS A GOOD THING.

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:31.655
BUT THE PIECE THAT I WANT TO

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:32.923
FOCUS ON THAT I'M GOING TO VOTE

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.792
FOR THIS TODAY I'M GONNA.

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:36.427
SUPPORT MOVING IT OVER TO THE

00:41:36.493 --> 00:41:38.629
ASSEMBLY BUT I WANTED TO.

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:41.165
CONVEY IN MY VIEW THE CRITICAL

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:43.434
OF IMPORTANCE OF FIXING THE

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.936
REPAIR A- PORTION OF THE BILL

00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:46.971
AND THE REPAYMENT PORTION OF

00:41:47.037 --> 00:41:49.640
THE BILL. NEEDS SIGNIFICANT

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:52.309
WORK ON I'M GONNA EXPLAIN WHY-

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:56.614
IT IS A TEN YEAR REPAYMENT BY

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.049
IT MY UNDERSTANDING IS AND

00:41:59.116 --> 00:42:01.652
AMEND IN ADDITION- IF THERE IS

00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:03.587
A HARSHA PROVISION. FOR PEOPLE

00:42:03.654 --> 00:42:05.389
WHO ARE MAKING IT SLIDING SCALE

00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:06.490
DEPENDING ON WHAT PERCENT OF

00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:08.692
THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME- YOU'RE

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:11.362
MAKING- BUT THE WITH THE

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:14.832
CHALLENGE IS. TWO FOLD FIRST AS

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:16.400
I UNDERSTAND THE WHERE IS THE

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:19.603
CREDITS THE TO TAX CREDITS OF

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.338
THE LANDLORDS RECEIVE. THOSE

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:22.606
ARE VESTED THEY HAVE THOSE THEY

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:24.541
CAN EXERCISE THOSE CREDITS OVER

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:25.576
TEN YEARS AND SELL THEM U

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:27.144
FRONT. THAT'S EITHER CASH IN

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:29.013
HAND OR GUARANTEE TAX CREDIT

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:32.349
OVER TEN YEARS. FOR THE RENTERS

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:34.418
WHO ARE GETTING A DISCOUNT OR

00:42:34.485 --> 00:42:35.853
COMPLETE WAIVER. OF THEIR

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.657
REPAYMENT. IT IS NOT GUARANTEED

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:40.758
AS I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS

00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:42.760
EFFECTIVELY SUBJECT TO ANNUAL

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:45.129
APPROPRIATION TO PAY FOR THOSE

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:47.765
TAX CREDITS AND SO IT IS NOT

00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:49.700
GUARANTEED AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE

00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:50.701
NO REASON TO THINK THE

00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:52.269
LEGISLATURE WOULD HONOR THAT

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:53.871
EVERY YEAR WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:55.339
THE FUTURE HOLDS AND IF I'M

00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:57.374
WRONG ABOUT THAT THEN I ASKED

00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:58.676
TO BE CORRECTED FROM MY

00:42:58.742 --> 00:43:00.377
UNDERSTANDING AS IT IS NOT

00:43:00.444 --> 00:43:02.546
GUARANTEED AND SUBJECT TO

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:04.381
ANNUAL APPROPRIATION- AND SO I

00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:07.251
WOULD I THINK. IT WE'D THERE'S

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:08.886
NOTHING THAT I CAN TELL YOU

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:11.188
STILL SEE THAT WOULD PREVENT US

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:13.958
FROM MAKING THESE. EFFECTIVELY

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:16.060
VESTED TAX CREDITS THE SAME WAY

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:17.261
THAT THE LANDLORDS ARE GETTING

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:18.762
THE BEST A TAX FOR THAT THEY DO

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:21.432
NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER

00:43:21.498 --> 00:43:24.969
IT'S GOING TO BE BUDGET YEAR BY

00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:25.836
BUDGET YOUR FUNDED. I THINK

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:26.937
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO

00:43:27.004 --> 00:43:28.839
HAVE THAT CONFIDENCE- IN

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:33.210
ADDITION. THE REPAYMENT PROCESS

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:37.247
IS CLUNKY IT IS NOT A SEAMLESS

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:39.149
YOU HAVE TO DO IT I BELIEVE

00:43:39.216 --> 00:43:41.385
THROUGH YOUR TAX RETURN. SO IF

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:42.953
YOU STOP BEING A CALIFORNIA

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:43.587
RESIDENT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:45.723
CONTINUE FILE IN CALIFORNIA TAX

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:49.093
RETURN IN ORDER TO MAKE THE

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:50.961
REPAYMENT OR TO GET THE-

00:43:51.028 --> 00:43:52.730
DISCOUNTED OR ELIMINATED.

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.999
PAYMENT AND IF YOU ARE SOMEONE

00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:56.934
WHO DOES NOT OTHERWISE FILE

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:58.669
TAXES BECAUSE OF MY BIGGEST

00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:00.771
CONCERN HERE IS FOR LOWEST.

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:03.774
INCOME RENTERS WHO DON'T FILE

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:05.309
TAX RETURNS THEY'RE NOT GOING

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:07.978
TO HAVE TO START FILING TAX

00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:10.781
RETURNS. IN ORDER TO. SAY I

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:12.516
DON'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY. TO

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:14.251
REPAY FOR PUTTING THIS NEW TEN

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:15.886
YEAR OBLIGATION ON NUMBER

00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:16.420
SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.088
TYPICALLY DO BECAUSE OF POOR

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:19.857
THEY DON'T MAKE ENOUGH. TO FILE

00:44:19.923 --> 00:44:22.426
A TAX RETURN. AND WE'RE ALSO

00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:24.228
TALKING ABOUT VERY DIVERSE

00:44:24.294 --> 00:44:25.863
COMMUNITY OF LOW INCOME RENTERS

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:27.131
INCLUDING RENTERS WHO DON'T

00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:28.632
SPEAK ENGLISH. INCLUDING

00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:31.568
RENTERS WHO ARE NOT DOCUMENTED-

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.437
AND WERE NOW SAY YOU DON'T HAVE

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:34.905

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:36.840
NEVER ANSWERED BEFORE. AND NOT

00:44:36.907 --> 00:44:38.409
JUST ONCE AT THE BEGINNING

00:44:38.475 --> 00:44:40.077
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE POOR CAN'T

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:43.414

WAVER YEAR BY YEAR. BECAUSE

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:50.654
SOMEONE COULD HAS TO RE AS THE

RE UP AND PROVE THEIR INCOME

00:44:54.124 --> 00:44:56.660
AGAIN EVERY YEAR- AND SO WERE

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:59.296

VERY COMPLICATED- AND WE'RE NOT

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:12.209
EVEN GUARANTEEING THAT WE'RE

00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:15.512

IT ON IT'S NOT ANTICIPATED THAT

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:39.930
IT REQUIRES AN ANNUAL

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:42.733
APPROPRIATION. THAT'S NOT THE

00:46:42.799 --> 00:46:43.300
WAY THAT THIS THE SYSTEM HAS

00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:45.102
BEEN SET UP. YEAH WE SEE WHAT

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:45.969
WE CAN JUST GET CLARITY ON THAT

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:46.970
THAT'S WHAT I'D BEEN IMPORTANT

00:46:47.037 --> 00:46:51.508
TERMS OF WHAT'S IMPLICIT IN THE

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:52.476
BELTS ON EXPLICIT. OKAY THE

BRADFORD ALL INVOLVED HAVE

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:01.218
REALLY BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE

00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:03.353
OUT. A MECHANISM RIGHT FOR

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.623
RELIEF. BUT OBVIOUSLY OPEN FOR-

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.392
ONGOING COMMUNICATION VIA TO

GET THIS RIGHT FOR ALL WOULD

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.827
THAT BE FAIR TO SAY I THINK

00:47:10.894 --> 00:47:12.296
THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY THE ISSUE

00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:14.965
IS THAT. ON THE CHALLENGE THAT

00:47:15.032 --> 00:47:16.934

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.702
SENATOR MORLOCK LAID OUT WHICH

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:19.703
IS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:20.504
TRYING TO DO IS SOMETHING THAT

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:22.406
WE HAVEN'T DONE BEFORE. AND

00:47:22.472 --> 00:47:23.640
QUITE FRANKLY WE'RE TRYING TO

00:47:23.707 --> 00:47:25.742

YOU THE CALIFORNIA STATE BUDGET

00:47:31.848 --> 00:47:33.984
BY BY DOING THE PROCESS. BUT WE

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:36.353
ARE MAKING SURE. THAT WE'RE

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.691
WE'RE NOT ENTERING. A TIME.

00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:43.560
ONCE THE- THAT EXECUTIVE ORDERS

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:44.962
OF THE GOVERNOR HAVE THEY

LAPSED. YOU WILL HAVE.

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:48.432
POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:49.733
THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT-

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.702
MONEY THAT WON'T BE ABLE TO PAY

00:47:51.768 --> 00:47:53.670

00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:55.205
LANDLORDS START THIS ADDICTION

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:57.341
PROCESS. THEN YOU HAVE HUNDREDS

00:47:57.407 --> 00:47:59.142
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT NO

THEY'RE GETTING PARTIAL RENT.

00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:31.535
MAYBE THERE HAS TO BE SOME

00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:32.703
SHOWING THAT THERE'S NOT

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:33.837
SUFFICIENT EQUITY FOR

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:35.439
FORECLOSURE SOME PEOPLE OF TALK

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:36.740
TO ME ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE YOU

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:38.608
THINK ABOUT IT IT'S A SERIES OF

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:40.043
PRESSURES. YOU GET THE

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.878
COMPRESSIONAL TENET. YOU'VE GOT

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.780
COMPRESSION A LANDLORD. IF YOU

00:49:43.847 --> 00:49:44.948
GET THE COMPRESSION OF THE BANK

00:49:45.015 --> 00:49:46.116
IF THERE ARE GETTING THEIR

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:47.117
MONEY AND THAT THEY FOR

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:48.819
CLOTHES. IF THEY'RE SUFFICIENT

00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:50.787
EQUITY IN THE PROPERTY AND THEY

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:51.688
COULD ACTUALLY RENEGOTIATE

00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:53.457
MAYBE. WE COULD PUT SOMETHING

00:49:53.523 --> 00:49:55.859
IN HERE THAT SAYS WHEN SOMEBODY

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:57.060
HAS A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF

00:49:57.127 --> 00:49:59.363
THEIR UNITS. SUBJECT TO THESE

00:49:59.429 --> 00:50:01.264
AGREEMENTS. THAT THERE HAS TO

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:02.999
BE SOME SHOWING BY THE LANDLORD

00:50:03.066 --> 00:50:04.634
IN SOME WAYS JUST IT SEEMS TO

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:06.336
ME SOME SENSITIVITY THAT MIGHT.

00:50:06.403 --> 00:50:07.604
AS WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.539
ARTICULATED HERE. AND SECONDLY

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:11.475
THE ON APPROPRIATIONS I JUST

00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:12.509
SAW THAT THAT WAS ADDED BY AN

00:50:12.576 --> 00:50:14.478
AMENDMENT. AND I THINK THE

00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:15.212
PURPOSE OF THAT WAS THE WAY THE

00:50:15.278 --> 00:50:16.813
BILL READS. IS IT SAYS THEY CAN

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.516
START USING THE TAX CREDIT

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:21.118
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:21.718
FIVE TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN.

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:23.553
GOING UP FOR TEN YEARS. IF

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.756
THEY'RE ALL USED IN YEAR ONE.

00:50:25.822 --> 00:50:27.224
THAT COULD CREATE A PROBLEM IN

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.558
THE BUDGET I THINK WHAT WAS

00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:30.327
ASKED HERE PROBABLY TALK TO OUR

00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:31.828
CONSULTANT HERE. IN THESE

00:50:31.895 --> 00:50:33.730
AMENDMENTS. THAT THEY WANTED TO

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:36.133
BE IN A POSITION JUST IN CASE.

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:37.401
THAT WAS TOO MUCH COMPRESSION.

00:50:37.467 --> 00:50:39.803
AND WE'RE STILL IN THE HOLE IN

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:40.570
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WE COULD

00:50:40.637 --> 00:50:43.073
LESSEN THE BURDEN ON THE STATE.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.207
AND EXTEND THE- THOSE TAX

00:50:44.274 --> 00:50:45.842
CREDITS OUT. AND I MET IF YOU

00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:47.477
DID THAT IN IN THE LINE.

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:49.479
PROBLEM AFFECT THE- IN TERMS

WHAT PEOPLE WILLING TO PAY AND

00:50:51.782 --> 00:50:54.017
DISCOUNT RATES FOR THAT. BUT I

00:50:54.084 --> 00:50:54.618
DON'T THINK IT REALLY AFFECTS

00:50:54.684 --> 00:50:55.452
THE- VERY. MORE KIND OF

00:50:55.519 --> 00:50:57.220

MONTHS WITHOUT PAYING RENT. SO

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:22.399
THAT'S WHAT WE PUT THE

00:53:22.465 --> 00:53:24.200
MECHANISMS BACK THE TENTATIVE

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:27.237
STILL REPORT REQUIRED TO MAKE

LEAVE THE LANDLORD IN JEOPARDY

00:53:41.484 --> 00:53:43.219
OF LOSING THAT PROPERTY. AND

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:44.554
THAT'S JUST AS BAD BECAUSE

AGAIN AT THE LANDLORD FOR

00:53:46.156 --> 00:53:47.958
CLOSER THE ONLY DOES THAT

00:53:48.024 --> 00:53:49.859
CREATE FINANCIAL RUIN FOR THE

00:53:49.926 --> 00:53:51.528
LANDLORD BUT IT ALSO AFFECTS

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:54.464
THE TENANT. SO WE'RE TRYING TO

00:53:54.531 --> 00:53:57.133
THREAT THAT NEEDLE CAN COME UP

WITH A PROGRAM THAT LOOKS OUT.

00:53:57.968 --> 00:54:01.037
AT BOTH PARTIES. THIS PROCESS

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:04.274

ADVANTAGE OF IT THIS IS A

00:54:14.951 --> 00:54:17.621
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM IT'S NOT

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:18.788
FORCED UPON ANYONE TO

00:54:20.423 --> 00:54:22.325
THE WHAT BUT THIS WOULD BE AN

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:24.694
INCENTIVE FOR A TENANT HI I

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:26.529
