ALLUDED TO BY THE AUTHOR IS IN

02:33:52.056 --> 02:33:54.024
VIOLATION OF THE SEVENTEENTH

THIS BILL SEEKS TO SOLVE THE

02:34:04.635 --> 02:34:06.537
CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM IN THE

02:34:06.604 --> 02:34:08.238
MOST ON THE DEMOCRATIC

02:34:08.305 --> 02:34:10.841
CONCEIVABLE WAY BY KICKING THE

02:34:10.908 --> 02:34:12.610
CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED

02:34:12.676 --> 02:34:14.244

WITH THE NEXT REGULARLY

02:34:22.119 --> 02:34:24.021
SCHEDULED ELECTION. SO THE

02:34:24.088 --> 02:34:26.957
RESULT OF THIS SCHEME TO REDUCE

02:34:27.024 --> 02:34:29.093
THE WILL OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS

02:34:29.159 --> 02:34:30.761
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IS IT WILL

02:34:30.828 --> 02:34:33.030
PRODUCE A TOTAL ABSURDITY NEXT

YEAR WHEN YOU GO TO VOTE YOU'RE

02:34:35.099 --> 02:34:36.333

02:34:41.472 --> 02:34:42.506
WILL SERVE THE LAST MONTH OR

02:34:42.573 --> 02:34:44.608
TWO. OF WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:34:44.675 --> 02:34:45.943
KAMILLA HARRIS IS TERM AND

02:34:46.010 --> 02:34:47.211
YOU'LL HAVE A SECOND VOTE ON

WHO WILL SERVE THE NEW SIX YEAR

02:34:49.279 --> 02:34:51.415
TERM IN MY VIEW THE BETTER

02:34:51.482 --> 02:34:52.783
APPROACH WOULD BE TO HAVE AN

02:34:52.850 --> 02:34:55.085
ELECTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO

02:34:55.152 --> 02:34:57.187
RESTORE CALIFORNIA'S FULL

ALLOTMENT OF TWO ELECTED UNITED

02:35:00.090 --> 02:35:01.625
STATES SENATORS THIS IS

02:35:01.692 --> 02:35:03.594
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. WHEN WE

02:35:03.661 --> 02:35:05.829
HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO IS OUT

02:35:05.896 --> 02:35:07.231
MUSING ABOUT WHO HE'LL APPOINT

02:35:07.297 --> 02:35:09.333
TO REPLACE DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO

02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:11.101
HASN'T EVEN INDICATED THAT

02:35:11.168 --> 02:35:12.903
SHE'S GOING TO RESIGN SO I

02:35:12.970 --> 02:35:14.038
THINK THAT THIS BILL MOVES US

02:35:14.104 --> 02:35:18.709
IN EXACTLY THE WRONG DIRECTION.

02:35:18.776 --> 02:35:21.578
AND I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE.

02:35:21.645 --> 02:35:25.249
THIS MISTER GALLAGHER YOU'RE

02:35:25.315 --> 02:35:27.151
RECOGNIZED. YEAH I THINK YOU

02:35:27.217 --> 02:35:27.985
MISTER SPEAKER I THINK ANOTHER

02:35:28.052 --> 02:35:29.319
THING TO POINT OUT ABOUT THIS

02:35:29.386 --> 02:35:32.156
BILL IS IN DIRECT CONTRAVENTION

02:35:32.222 --> 02:35:33.590
TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT

02:35:33.657 --> 02:35:35.426
THAT MADE IT WOULD HAVE DIRECT

02:35:35.492 --> 02:35:37.461
ELECTIONS OF OUR SENATORS IT

02:35:37.528 --> 02:35:38.562
USED TO BE THAT STATE

02:35:38.629 --> 02:35:41.131
LEGISLATURES. WOULD PICK THE

02:35:41.198 --> 02:35:44.401
SENATORS FOR THEIR STATE AND

02:35:44.468 --> 02:35:46.637
OUR US CONSTITUTION WAS CHANGED

02:35:46.704 --> 02:35:49.039
SHOULDN'T IT BE THAT. TO ME

02:35:49.106 --> 02:35:51.442
THIS IS VERY ANTI DEMOCRATIC TO

02:35:51.508 --> 02:35:53.610
SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE. AN
