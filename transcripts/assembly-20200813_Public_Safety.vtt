00:28:19.297 --> 00:28:21.766
RULE AND VIOLATES IS EIGHT

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:23.535
FUNDAMENTAL HARM AGAINST

OUT OF SERVICES SOCIETY AND

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:29.741
PUNISH THEM BY PUTTING THEM IN

00:28:29.808 --> 00:28:34.345
PRISON. THE GOP ARE OUR BASIC-

00:28:34.412 --> 00:28:37.682
MORAL CODE IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE

00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:42.654
DONE THEIR TIME THEY PAID THEIR

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.622

BECAUSE THEY PAID THEIR DEBT.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.868
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT

00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:58.503
DOESN'T HAPPEN. THE TRUTH OF

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.271
THE MATTER IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE

00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:02.740
ARE LET OUT OF PRISON. OFTEN

00:29:02.807 --> 00:29:03.708

AND PEOPLE SEE ALL YOUR GOOD

00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:08.079
COMMITTING CRIMES AGAIN WE

00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:08.646
LITERALLY GIVE PEOPLE

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:10.014
OPPORTUNITIES YOU KNOW SUPPORT

00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:12.684
IF SOMEONE'S BEEN AWAY FOR A

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.152
LONG TIME. ALL OF THIS KIND OF

00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:17.856
HUMAN ARCHITECTURE OF WHAT WE

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:20.492
DO IS MISSING TWENTY EIGHT

00:29:20.558 --> 00:29:21.559
STATES HAVE RE ENTRY

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:25.497
COMMISSIONS. WE RELEASED ALMOST

00:29:25.563 --> 00:29:26.097

00:29:26.164 --> 00:29:30.902
THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR BY THE

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:31.436
HUNT ROUND NUMBERS ABOUT A

00:29:31.503 --> 00:29:32.070
HUNDRED A DAY. AND SO. THE IDEA

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:34.172
BEHIND THIS IS TO KIND OF

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:36.241
COORDINATE ALL OF THE ACTIVITY

00:29:36.307 --> 00:29:37.208
THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:38.810
PROGRAMS AND OTHER THINGS. BUT

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:40.612
FOCUSING ON THE INDIVIDUAL

00:29:40.678 --> 00:29:41.279
BRINGING THE RIGHT PEOPLE

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:43.548
TOGETHER. WE IN FACT IS THE

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:53.558
BILL SAYS- THE THAT WE HAVE. ON.

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:54.159
FORTY THREE THOUSAND RE ENTRY

00:29:54.225 --> 00:29:56.794
BARRIERS AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED

DOCUMENTARY BE IF WE HAD TEA IN

00:29:58.229 --> 00:29:59.864
THE STATE SOMEONE'S GOING TO

00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:01.799
TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF

00:30:01.866 --> 00:30:03.701
THAT. COORDINATE BOTH RESOURCES

00:30:03.768 --> 00:30:06.538
FROM PHILANTHROPIC WORLDS FROM

00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:07.172
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE

00:30:07.238 --> 00:30:08.740
STATE GOVERNMENT AND TRY TO

00:30:08.806 --> 00:30:11.309
FOCUS ON THE HUMAN CONDITION OF

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:13.011
HOW TO REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS

00:30:13.077 --> 00:30:15.046
FOR FOLKS. AND SO THIS IS

00:30:15.113 --> 00:30:16.014
SOMETHING IT DOESN'T COST MORE

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.515
MONEY WEEK YESTERDAY TO BE A

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:18.416

COMING TOGETHER AND RECOGNIZING

00:30:37.101 --> 00:30:39.170
A PROBLEM AND QUITE FRANKLY

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:40.238
