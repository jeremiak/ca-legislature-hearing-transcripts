00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:40.985
THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:42.286
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE TYPES

00:43:42.353 --> 00:43:43.387
OF THAT. IT IS AN ENFORCEMENT

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:45.589
ISSUE THE OTHER THING IS WE

00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:47.725
HAVE A DOLLAR AMOUNT ON THIS

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:49.059
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:50.394
RETAIL BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVEN

00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:51.028
KNOW WHAT'S IN THE PACKAGE. SO

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:52.096
NOW WE'RE NOW GOING TO

00:43:52.162 --> 00:43:52.730
POTENTIALLY CREATE A FELONY FOR

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.198
SOMEONE WHO MAYBE DID EVEN AND

00:43:54.264 --> 00:43:56.834
TAMMY WAS A SMALL PACKAGE I

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:57.468
THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE A SMALL

00:43:57.534 --> 00:43:58.502
AMOUNT TURNS OUT TO BE

00:43:58.569 --> 00:44:01.638
SOMETHING LARGER. A LOT OF

00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:04.274
HOMES WITH IT BUT MOST

00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:06.910
IMPORTANTLY IT'S GONNA REMIND

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:12.416
INS VENT THE VOTER APPROVED

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:13.017
INITIATIVE. IS REASON. TO TAKE

00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:19.056
FOR THE TOP. THE BOOK OF. IN

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:24.595
VISIT. YEAH BRING. BRING IT

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:25.129
BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS

00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:27.164
THERE'S- ANY QUESTIONS OR

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:29.133
COMMENTS I HAVE A COMMENT.

00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:29.700
FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO

THANK YOU FOR A- ACTUALLY

00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:32.336
RECOGNIZING A PROBLEM IT'S A

00:44:32.403 --> 00:44:33.237
VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR MANY

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:34.671
PEOPLE AND- I AND- AS WAS

00:44:34.738 --> 00:44:36.206
ECHOED BY SOME OF THE COMMENTS

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:36.907
ALREADY WISH THAT IT DID GO

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:38.142
FURTHER I KNOW YOU'RE TEMPTED

00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:41.478
FOR THAT. BUT IT IS A STEP IN

00:44:41.545 --> 00:44:44.014
THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND- I JUST

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:46.917
A- I'M EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED BY.

00:44:46.984 --> 00:44:48.185
THE REALITIES THAT THAT SOME OF

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:49.686
OUR LEGISLATION IS A RELEASE TO

00:44:49.753 --> 00:44:52.856
THEFT HAS RESULTED I JUST WANT

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:53.390
TO SHARE VERY BRIEF STORY

00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:55.426
BECAUSE IT'S VERY REAL AND IT.

00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:57.194
IT TELLS. THE REAL

00:44:57.261 --> 00:44:58.395
CIRCUMSTANCES WERE DEALING WITH

00:44:58.462 --> 00:45:00.898
AS A SOCIETY. I AM A VERY

00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:04.001
CLOSE. PERSON WHO JUST SHARED

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:07.104
WITH ME WHO WORKS IN RETAIL.

00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:07.704
AND THEY WORK IN A MALL IN MY

00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:09.940
DISTRICT AND- THIS PERSON

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:12.109
HAPPENS TO BE A DOESN'T HAS

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:14.878
SOME PLAY THAT THAT CAME TO ME.

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.713
THEN SHE INDICATED TO ME THE

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.283
FRUSTRATION SHE HAD BECAUSE-

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:23.053
WHERE SHE WORKS THERE IS. A

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.922
COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT WERE-

00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:27.458
GATHERING CLOTHING AND CREATED

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:30.694
TO ARM FULLS OF CLOTHING. AND

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:31.228
PROCEEDED TO WALK OUT THE

00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:34.798
ALARMS WENT OFF. AND SHE LOOKED

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:36.867
AT HER MANAGER AND HER MANAGER

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:39.303
SHOOK HER HEAD NO. AND LET HER

00:45:39.369 --> 00:45:41.972
GO LET THEM GO SHE SAID THERE

00:45:42.039 --> 00:45:42.673
WAS PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR

00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:44.608
HUNDRED DOLLARS OF CLOTHING.

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:46.643
THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT IS

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:47.177
PERMEATING RIGHT NOW THAT

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:48.879
THERE'S NO ACTION BEING TAKEN.

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:51.115
AND THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG WAY

00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:54.118
TOO FAR THE OTHER WAY. AND I DO

00:45:54.184 --> 00:45:55.119
BELIEVE IN BALANCE AND WE'RE IN

00:45:55.185 --> 00:45:56.954
A VERY VERY IMBALANCED

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.590
CIRCUMSTANCE RIGHT NOW. BUT I.

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:01.191
I HARDLY SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.026
IT'S A PORTION OF JUSTICE THAT

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:04.828
OUR SOCIETY IS STARVING FOR.

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:07.097
AND ONE OF THE COMMENTS

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:10.767
MENTIONED INITIATIVES STAND BY.

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:11.401
TWENTY TWENTY THERE IS GONNA BE

00:46:11.468 --> 00:46:12.836
AN INITIATIVE TO TRY TO BALANCE

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:13.403
THIS OUT AND- WE'LL SEE WHAT

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:19.476
HAPPENS. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:23.947

A SUMMER AS BY STATING THAT

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:31.455
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I THINK

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:32.789
WE ALL KNOW SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:34.024
A VICTIM IN FACT WITH THE

00:46:34.091 --> 00:46:36.360
ADVENT OF TECHNOLOGY EVEN WITH

RING AND THE OTHERS YOU HAVE

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:40.531

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:42.232
PERPETRATORS KNOW THAT THEY CAN

00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:44.067
GET AWAY WITH THIS- BUT THIS IS

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:46.003
JUST A SMALL STEP TO SAY THIS

00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:47.838
IS THE FIRST POLICY HEARING AND

00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:49.072
WORKING WITH THE CHAIR TO

00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:51.141

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:52.643
ISSUE FORWARD. AND WAS ALSO

IN SUPPORT OF PROP FORTY SEVEN-

00:47:04.454 --> 00:47:06.590
SO THIS BY NO MEANS IS ANY

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:09.793
ATTEMPT TO LOOK AT- SOME OF THE

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.161
ARGUMENTS THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:12.296
A DISPROPORTIONATE HURTING

OTHER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

COMMITMENT. TO WORK WITH YOU TO

TRY TO FIND THAT BALANCE. IT'S

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:49.633
KIND OF IRONIC THAT. BOTH SIDES

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.267
HAITI MEMBERS WHICH SOUNDS GOOD

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:54.238
TO ME- AND THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:47:54.304 --> 00:47:56.306
FULLY ON BOARD WHICH IS WHY.

00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:57.808
HOPEFULLY IT STARTS TO

00:47:57.874 --> 00:47:58.942
CONVERSATION BECAUSE TRYING TO

00:47:59.009 --> 00:48:00.510
DRIVE THAT BALANCE BETWEEN

00:48:00.577 --> 00:48:05.115
ACTUALLY. GOING AFTER PEOPLE

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:06.350
WHO ARE DOING THIS ON A

00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:09.753
CONSISTENT BASIS- FOR A GUEST

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:10.921
BOOK PROFIT IS WHAT WERE THEY

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:13.490
THINKING AS OPPOSED TO TRYING

00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:18.028
TO FIND. AND I WILL USE ON ONE

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:19.062
HAND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE

00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:21.598
DETERRENTS FOR PEOPLE. WHO ARE

00:48:21.665 --> 00:48:23.667
CRIMINALS WHO WANT TO DO THIS

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:26.703
AS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE AT

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.006
THE POVERTY LEVEL OR BECAUSE OF

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:30.474
THE CIRCUMSTANCES HOW COME WE

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.342
BUY THEM A JOB. HOW CAN WE GET

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:34.311
HIM OFF DRUGS HOW CAN WE MAKE

00:48:34.378 --> 00:48:37.214
SURE THAT THEY DOESN'T REOCCUR.

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:38.982
I DON'TTHINK THEIR MUTUAL

00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:39.583
EXCUSE SCHOOLS OF AND I THINK

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.852
THAT'S BEEN. I THINK THAT'S

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:43.954
BEEN OUR CHALLENGE OF HOW CAN

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:46.723
YOU BLEND. THE TWO IN A IN A

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:49.092
SEVENTY TWO WAY AND SO- I LOOK

00:48:49.159 --> 00:48:51.361
AT THIS BILL AND WHAT WE'RE

00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:53.697
DOING NOW. AS MAYBE THE START.

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:56.166
OF BRIDGING THAT SO WE DON'T

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:57.968
HAVE TO GO TO ABOUT SO THAT WE

00:48:58.035 --> 00:48:59.503
DON'T HAVE TO CONSTANTLY GO

00:48:59.569 --> 00:49:01.071
BACK AND FORTH WITH ONE

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:03.073
ANOTHER- ESPECIALLY WHEN I HEAR

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.175
BOTH SIDES SAY THE SAME THING.

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:07.044
THAT WE DO NEED TO COME UP

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:09.846
WITH. AVENUES TO HELP PEOPLE.

00:49:09.913 --> 00:49:12.649
WHO ARE ON DRUGS WHO MAY BE A

00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:13.216
MOTHER WHO HAS TO FEED THEIR

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:16.353
KIDS. WILL WE SHOULDN'T

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:16.920
CRIMINALIZED THEM AND EXPECT

00:49:16.987 --> 00:49:21.158
THEM. TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF

00:49:21.224 --> 00:49:22.492
THE POVERTY CYCLE BY PUTTING A

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.928
FELONY ON THEM AND THEN SAY OH

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:25.996

BACK IN SOCIETY AND BE ABLE. TO

00:49:28.965 --> 00:49:31.601
SURVIVE BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS.

00:49:31.668 --> 00:49:33.036
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO RENT AN

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:34.371
APARTMENT THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:35.605
TO GET A JOB IF YOU YOUNG YOU

YOUR INTENT. AND THAT'S NOT

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:50.087
WHAT I THINK THE D. A.'S

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:51.188
OFFICE. AS I SAID I DON'T

00:49:51.254 --> 00:49:53.623
THINK- PEOPLE ONLY ASIDE. WHILE

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:56.893
ON THE OTHER SIDE. WE DO HAVE

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.629
TO PROSECUTE PEOPLE. AND WE

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:01.698
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THOSE THAT

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:03.467
WANT TO BECOME CRIMINALS I WANT

00:50:03.533 --> 00:50:05.168
TO BE CRIMINAL. THAT DESK THEIR

00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:07.637
SOLE CONCERN IS TO DO THAT AND

00:50:07.704 --> 00:50:09.840
BECOME A PLAGUE ON THE SOCIETY.

00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:10.407
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DETER

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:14.444
THEM. OR THE HOLD THEM OR KEEP

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:15.746
THEM AWAY FROM SOCIETY SO HOW

00:50:15.812 --> 00:50:18.281
DO YOU CREATE. THAT BALANCE AND

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:19.416
THAT'S WHAT I MAKE THAT'S KIND

00:50:19.483 --> 00:50:21.451
OF THE PLANE BILL WERE ON AND

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:22.753
SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN ALL

00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:25.021
GET INTO ROOM. AND UNDERSTAND

00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:26.890
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:27.391
GET TO THIS IS WHERE OUR

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:29.192
ASPIRATIONS ARE. AND MAYBE YOUR

00:50:29.259 --> 00:50:32.095
BILL MISTER LOW. TO BE TH

00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:34.831
OPENING- FOR THAT AND THAT'S

00:50:34.898 --> 00:50:37.868
WHY NOW WE ARE SUPPORTING IT-

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:40.804
I'M- I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WHEN

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:45.542
WE GET TO THAT PLACE- NOT ONLY

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:47.010
BOTH SIDES STILL DON'T LIKE BUT

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:48.845
WE MAY START THE DISCUSSION OF

00:50:48.912 --> 00:50:50.947
HOW WE CAN BRIDGE THE GAP.

00:50:51.014 --> 00:50:54.017
BETWEEN REALLY AREN'T SMART AND

COURT CASE WE CHANGE LAWS HEE

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:14.597
IN CALIFORNIA IN THE INTERESTS

OF JUSTICE AND WE DID WE DID

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:17.933
PRIMARILY TWO THINGS. I WON

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.137
SAID THAT THERE SHALL BE. IS

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:23.305
FOR JUVENILES WHO WERE

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:24.407
SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT THE

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:26.709
POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. THERE

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:30.246
SHALL BE S. A HEARING. BEFORE A

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:31.213
JUDGE WE CAN SHOW WHERE SOMEONE

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.783
COULD SHOW THIS IS HOW I HAVE

01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:36.585
CHANGED THIS IS HOW- MY

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:37.953
CHARACTER HAS BEEN IMPROVE THIS

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.955
IS THE THINGS I'VE BEEN DOING

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:42.425
TO GET BETTER THAT I HAVE SHOWN

01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:44.126
REMORSE. FOR THE CRIME. THAT

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:47.196
WAS COMMITTED. WE ALSO

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:51.700
PROVIDED. A SECONDARY- REFORM

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:54.203
IS AUTOMATIC. PAROLE HEARINGS

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:56.939
AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS SERVE

01:07:57.006 --> 01:07:58.340
FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN

01:07:58.407 --> 01:08:00.376
SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:02.278
POSSIBILITY ROLE SO WE DID

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:05.948
THOSE TWO THINGS- WHAT MY BILL

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:08.684
DOES TODAY. THIS IS CLEAR. IT

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.753
DOESN'T ROLL BACK ANY OF THOSE

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:14.056
THINGS. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THOSE

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:15.524
TWO CONCEPTS AND OUR LAW. WHAT

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.759
IT ACTUALLY DOES IS MERRY THE

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:20.062
TWO THINGS TOGETHER. IT MARRIES

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:26.001
THOSE TWO CONCEPTS TOGETHER.

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:26.635
AND IT ALSO HELPS US ANSWER THE

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:28.304
QUESTION OF. THAT IS STILL

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:32.208
UNANSWERED. BUYER LAW WHAT

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.578
ABOUT SOMEONE WHO. WHO IN FACT

01:08:35.644 --> 01:08:38.514
IS IRREPARABLY CORRUPT WHAT

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:40.182
ABOUT SOMEONE WHO IS A

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:43.452
SOCIOPATH AND HAS NOT CHANGED

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:45.321
AND THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE IN

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:46.856
THE FINDING SHOWS HAS NOT

01:08:46.922 --> 01:08:51.427
CHANGED- I THINK WE ALL. HAVE

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:54.897
COMPASSION AND HAVE. AN

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:56.165
INTEREST ENSURING THAT THOSE

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:57.800
WHO HAVE CHANGE HAVE AN

01:08:57.867 --> 01:09:00.236
OPPORTUNITY TO BE REHABILITATED.

01:09:00.302 --> 01:09:01.837
BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:05.841
THEY EXIST. THAT TRULY ARE

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:06.375
SOCIOPATHS THAT DON'T SHOW

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:10.246
REMORSE. THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:14.016
TO PSYCHOLOGISTS WHO EVALUATED-

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:15.084
ALL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:16.485
THAT HAVE DETERMINED THAT NO

01:09:16.552 --> 01:09:18.153
THE INDIVIDUAL IS NOT CAPABLE

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.155
OF REHABILITATION. AND IN THAT

01:09:20.222 --> 01:09:23.726
CASE WE DO NEED TO HAVE

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.027
PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEY

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:27.296
DON'T GET THE BENEFIT OF

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:27.897
AUTOMATIC PAROLE AFTER TWENTY

01:09:27.963 --> 01:09:30.799
FIVE YEARS. AND SO THAT'S WHAT

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:36.171
ERIC'S LAW. DOES. AND IT'S IN

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:38.340
MEMORY OF ERIC INGER BREAST IN

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:40.943

YOU KNOW WHO WAS MURDERED IN A

01:09:44.213 --> 01:09:44.713
VERY HEINOUS WAY. AND THERE

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:48.951
WERE TWO MURDERS. CASE ONE WHO

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.253
HAS SHOWN REMORSE AND IS IN THE

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.589
PROCESS OF PAROLE AND ONE WHO

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:57.626
HAS BEEN FOUND BY A COURT AFTER

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:58.227
TWENTY YEARS NOT RIGHT WHEN HE

01:09:58.294 --> 01:10:01.463
WAS SENTENCED. BUT NOW TOWARD

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:02.398
YOUR WHO HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:05.401
IRREPARABLY CORRUPT AND YET HE

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:06.502
WILL CONTINUE TO GET

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:07.836
INDEFINITELY AROLE HEARING

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:11.140
STARTING NEXT YEAR. IF WE DON'T

01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:13.509
MARRY THESE CONCEPTS TOGETHER

CONTINUED BUT PRISON NOT FOR

01:58:10.483 --> 01:58:16.255
THOSE NOT FOR THOSE PEOPLE.

01:58:16.322 --> 01:58:16.889
IT'S TRUE THAT AT THE PROBOARDS

01:58:16.956 --> 01:58:18.991
LAW REQUIRES THAT OVER TO ME.

01:58:19.058 --> 01:58:20.693
MUCH LONG WILL TAKE ONE TO MEET

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:21.727
THEIR VERY HIGH STANDARD. NOT

01:58:21.794 --> 01:58:22.261
POSING ANY DANGER TO THE

01:58:22.328 --> 01:58:23.062
COMMUNITY SO PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE

01:58:23.129 --> 01:58:24.764
CLOSE TO MEETING THAT STANDARD

01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:26.365
WHO ARE BY DEFINITION NOT A REP

01:58:26.432 --> 01:58:28.034
OF THE CORRUPT MAY RETURN TO

EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR THREE YEARS-

01:58:30.937 --> 01:58:32.738
BUT BUT THAT'S NOT THOSE ARE.

01:58:32.805 --> 01:58:34.073
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY

01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:34.974
DIFFERENT FROM THE GROUP OF

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:37.376
PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT-

01:58:37.443 --> 01:58:39.145
AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS

01:58:39.212 --> 01:58:40.880
BEEN REFERRING TO. THANK YOU WE

01:58:40.947 --> 01:58:42.882

HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE FORMER.

01:58:45.785 --> 01:58:46.686
MEMBER OF THE BOARD A PRESENTER

01:58:46.752 --> 01:58:49.589
IS RIGHT HERE WITH US. THE

01:58:49.655 --> 01:58:50.590
SENATOR- BUT MISSED CUT BY THE

01:58:50.656 --> 01:58:53.693
DOG IN THE HOUSE. SO HE HAS A

01:58:53.759 --> 01:58:54.327
LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE ON THE

01:58:54.393 --> 01:58:57.797
ISSUE AS WELL. THANK YOU. THIS

01:58:57.864 --> 01:58:59.165
COUPLE HUNDRED OF THANK YOU I

01:58:59.232 --> 01:58:59.799
AM. A HAPPY NEW YEAR AND HAPPY

01:58:59.866 --> 01:59:01.534
BIRTHDAY- I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS

01:59:01.601 --> 01:59:03.836
THROUGH THE CHAIR- THE FIRST

01:59:03.903 --> 01:59:06.706
QUESTION IS- YOU KNOW WHO

01:59:06.772 --> 01:59:09.842
DETERMINES. IN THIS SCENARIO IF

01:59:09.909 --> 01:59:14.113
SOMEONE IS. ARAB LEAGUE CORRUPT

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:16.482
AND HOW CAN THAT BE OBJECTIVELY

01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:19.685
DETERMINED WITHIN A SYSTEM LIKE

01:59:19.752 --> 01:59:22.088
OUR PRISON SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

01:59:22.154 --> 01:59:23.623
ALREADY IDENTIFIED AS BEING A

01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:27.260
SYSTEM- RIFE WITH CHALLENGES

01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:28.728
AND FRAUGHT WITH SOME FAILURES

01:59:28.794 --> 01:59:32.164
SO THAT'S MY ONE QUESTION- AND

01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:34.400
I ASK IT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY YOU

01:59:34.467 --> 01:59:36.168
KNOW PASSED THE BILL TWO FOUR

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:38.938
TWO THAT IS WITH BIAS IN THE

01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:42.041
JUDICIAL SYSTEM- AND SO HOW IS

01:59:42.108 --> 01:59:43.342
THAT TAKEN OUT. AND THEN THE

01:59:43.409 --> 01:59:45.545
SECOND QUESTION IS- AS IT

01:59:45.611 --> 01:59:48.514
RELATES TO THE HEARINGS MY

01:59:48.581 --> 01:59:50.616
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU KNOW

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:52.885
IF THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE

01:59:52.952 --> 01:59:55.888
IT'S NOT GUARANTEED PAROLE AND

01:59:55.955 --> 01:59:58.791
SO THE POSSIBLE. ROLLING GOING

01:59:58.858 --> 02:00:01.093
BEFORE A PANEL FOR A HEARING IS

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:02.528
ABOUT TO PROCESS THE NIPPLE

02:00:02.595 --> 02:00:04.263
TAKING THIS A WHERE WE IN FACT

02:00:04.330 --> 02:00:05.965
TAKING AWAY- A PERSON'S ABILITY

02:00:06.032 --> 02:00:09.368
TO DUE PROCESS SO THOSE ARE MY

02:00:09.435 --> 02:00:10.770
TWO QUESTIONS THE OBJECTIVITY

02:00:10.836 --> 02:00:14.373
OF THE DEFINITION AND FOR MY-

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:18.744
PROCESS. IN THIS MAY BE. BUT

02:00:18.811 --> 02:00:20.179
IT'S ALSO HAD EXPERIENCE BEAT

02:00:20.246 --> 02:00:22.515
ON IT MIGHT HELPFUL ALSO SO HOW

02:00:22.582 --> 02:00:24.350
DO YOU WANT TO PARSE OUT THOSE

02:00:24.417 --> 02:00:25.651
TWO QUESTIONS- OF WELL ALL ALL

02:00:25.718 --> 02:00:26.852
STARTED IN A CAN THAT MY

02:00:26.919 --> 02:00:28.287
WITNESS TESTIFIES TO WHATEVER

02:00:28.354 --> 02:00:29.255
DO YOU WANT HE WOULD LIKE

02:00:29.322 --> 02:00:31.891
SENATOR WHO'S BEEN ON A PAROLE

02:00:31.958 --> 02:00:32.425
BOARD THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME

02:00:32.491 --> 02:00:34.060
EXPERIENCE ABOUT. HOW OFTEN IT

02:00:34.126 --> 02:00:37.897
IS. TYPICALLY THESE HEINOUS

02:00:37.964 --> 02:00:39.365
INDIVIDUALS LET ME LET ME START

02:00:39.432 --> 02:00:42.134
WITH HER QUESTION WHICH IS- WHO

02:00:42.201 --> 02:00:44.203
DETERMINES IT IT'S A JUDGE THAT

02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:46.305
DETERMINES IT THAT'S HOW IT IS

02:00:46.372 --> 02:00:48.474
RIGHT NOW. AT STATUS QUO. THERE

02:00:48.541 --> 02:00:50.042
ARE RE SENTENCING HEARINGS THAT

02:00:50.109 --> 02:00:52.878
ARE GRANTED TO EVERY JUVENILE

02:00:52.945 --> 02:00:53.446
OFFENDER WHO IS WHO HAS BEEN

02:00:53.512 --> 02:00:57.249
SENTENCED TO L. WHAT. AND WE

02:00:57.316 --> 02:00:58.484
AGREE WITH THAT POLICY WE'RE

02:00:58.551 --> 02:00:59.652
NOT DISAGREEING WITH THAT AT

02:00:59.719 --> 02:01:01.520
ALL IN FACT IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR

02:01:01.587 --> 02:01:02.655
A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE

02:01:02.722 --> 02:01:04.724
WE REALLY DON'T DISAGREE. THIS

02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:06.392
GENTLEMAN STORY IS AMAZING AND

02:01:06.459 --> 02:01:09.729
IT'S IT IS THE FRUIT OF THAT

02:01:09.795 --> 02:01:11.564
POLICY READ A PERSON WHO HAS

02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:14.000
CHANGED HIS. AND HIS CHANGE AND

02:01:14.066 --> 02:01:15.901
AS RECOGNIZE WHAT THEY DID AND

02:01:15.968 --> 02:01:17.837
SHOWS REMORSE GETS THE

02:01:17.903 --> 02:01:19.672
OPPORTUNITY TO PAROLE AND BE

02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:22.341
RELEASED RIGHT. BUT WHO MAKES

02:01:22.408 --> 02:01:24.310
THAT DETERMINATION IS THE JUDGE

02:01:24.377 --> 02:01:26.178
AND ARE I MEAN READING FROM MY

02:01:26.245 --> 02:01:28.280
BILL. THEY LOOK AT THE

02:01:28.347 --> 02:01:29.482
DEFENDANT'S FAMILY AND HOME

02:01:29.548 --> 02:01:30.816
ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING CHILDHOOD

02:01:30.883 --> 02:01:32.985
ABUSE OR NEGLECT FAMILIAL DRUG

02:01:33.052 --> 02:01:36.355
USE OR ALCOHOL ABUSE. THEY LOOK

02:01:36.422 --> 02:01:37.289
AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE AFFECT

02:01:37.356 --> 02:01:38.658
THE EXTENT OF THE DEFENDANTS

02:01:38.724 --> 02:01:41.327
PARTICIPATION. AND THE WAY

02:01:41.394 --> 02:01:43.162
FAMILIAR OR PEER PRESSURES.

02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:44.797
THAT YOU KNOW IN THE CASE OF A

02:01:44.864 --> 02:01:46.899
GANG MIGHT HAVE PLAYED AND

02:01:46.966 --> 02:01:49.201
PLAYED PLAYED A ROLE IN THAT.

02:01:49.268 --> 02:01:51.003
THEY LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE AGE

02:01:51.070 --> 02:01:53.239
OF THE PERSON IN THE THIS. YOU

02:01:53.305 --> 02:01:54.006
KNOW HOW IMMATURITY YEAR IN

02:01:54.073 --> 02:01:56.842
AND- PATCH YOU ARE CITY AND

02:01:56.909 --> 02:01:57.443
FAILURE TO APPRECIATE RISKING

02:01:57.510 --> 02:02:00.012
CONSEQUENCES. PSYCHOLOGY

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:00.546
INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS I

02:02:00.613 --> 02:02:02.782
DON'T TAKE AWAY ANY OF THAT.

02:02:02.848 --> 02:02:04.350
ALL THAT HAPPENS IN A JUDGE

02:02:04.417 --> 02:02:06.185
MAKES A DETERMINATION BASED ON

02:02:06.252 --> 02:02:07.920
ALL THAT EVIDENCE IF THE PERSON

02:02:07.987 --> 02:02:10.122
IS IRREPARABLY CORRUPTOR NOT.

02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:11.824
NOT AT THE TIME THEY WERE SENDS

02:02:11.891 --> 02:02:13.726
LIKE YEARS AFTER SO WE'RE

02:02:13.793 --> 02:02:14.326
LOOKING AT THE WHOLE PERIOD OF

02:02:14.393 --> 02:02:17.296
TIME. DEVON'S FAMILY JUST WENT

02:02:17.363 --> 02:02:17.797
THROUGH ONE OF THOSE RE

02:02:17.863 --> 02:02:20.700
SENTENCING HEARING. THE

02:02:20.766 --> 02:02:22.001
DEFENDANT WAS FOUND AFTER

02:02:22.068 --> 02:02:23.202
CONSIDERING ALL OF THAT TO BE

02:02:23.269 --> 02:02:26.138
IRREPARABLY CORRUPT. SO WE'RE

02:02:26.205 --> 02:02:29.008
JUST ST IN THAT CASE. DON'T

02:02:29.075 --> 02:02:30.710
GIVE GUARANTEED PAROLE HEARINGS

02:02:30.776 --> 02:02:31.477
IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GETTING

02:02:31.544 --> 02:02:33.579
NOW I AGREE WITH YOU BUT DON'T

02:02:33.646 --> 02:02:34.680
GIVE GUARANTEED PRO HEARINGS

02:02:34.747 --> 02:02:36.749
AGO INDEFINITELY AND COULD BE

02:02:36.816 --> 02:02:39.585
EVERY THREE YEARS. THAT HER

02:02:39.652 --> 02:02:41.120
FAMILY GETS DRAGGED BACK INTO

02:02:41.187 --> 02:02:42.121
THAT TO HAVE TO COME AND

02:02:42.188 --> 02:02:44.156
TESTIFY AND TALK AND BE DRAGGED

02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:44.690
THROUGH THE CRIME ALL OVER

02:02:44.757 --> 02:02:47.660
AGAIN. WHEN THERE'S ALREADY

02:02:47.727 --> 02:02:48.260
TERMINATION THAT HAD A WHOLE

02:02:48.327 --> 02:02:50.496
LOT OF STUFF THAT WENT INTO IT.

02:02:50.563 --> 02:02:51.864
THAT'S OUR ASKING FOR NOT

02:02:51.931 --> 02:02:53.632
TAKING AWAY THAT UNDERLYING

02:02:53.699 --> 02:02:54.867
POLICY WHICH I THINK WE ALL

02:02:54.934 --> 02:02:56.702
AGREE WITH. WHICH IS THAT

02:02:56.769 --> 02:02:57.937
PEOPLE DO DO THINGS WHEN

02:02:58.003 --> 02:02:59.672
THEY'RE YOUNG. THEY'RE BAD

02:02:59.739 --> 02:03:00.906
JUDGMENTS THAT ARE THINGS THAT

02:03:00.973 --> 02:03:03.008
HAPPEN. THE OTHER MURDER IN

02:03:03.075 --> 02:03:04.243
THIS CASE IS ONE OF THOSE

02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:06.011
PEOPLE. HE GOT DRAGGED ALONG

02:03:06.078 --> 02:03:09.982
FOR THE RIDE. AND HE IS BEING

02:03:10.049 --> 02:03:11.550
PAROLED AND HE'S SHOWN REMORSE

02:03:11.617 --> 02:03:14.987
AND HE'S GET. THE FAMILY. IS

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:16.088
SUPPORT OF AN ACCEPTED

02:03:16.155 --> 02:03:17.757
ACCEPTING OF THAT OKAY MISSED

02:03:17.823 --> 02:03:19.558
CODE SO THAT'S I MEAN I'M JUST

02:03:19.625 --> 02:03:20.593
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:03:20.659 --> 02:03:21.427
AND I THINK A LOT OF THINGS GET

02:03:21.494 --> 02:03:23.629
CONVOLUTED OUR POLITICS THESE

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:25.164
DAYS ARE SUCH THAT WE WANT TO

02:03:25.231 --> 02:03:27.333
GET ON OUR RESPECTIVE SIDES IN.

02:03:27.399 --> 02:03:28.434
AND CALL THE OTHER ONE DOING

02:03:28.501 --> 02:03:30.002
THIS BUT LET'S LOOK AT WHAT IT

02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:32.471
REALLY DOES IS MY POINT. AND I

02:03:32.538 --> 02:03:34.273
THINK IT'S A REASONABLE REFORM

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:37.109
THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT

02:03:37.176 --> 02:03:37.676
THE POLICY THAT EVERYBODY IN

02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:40.813
HERE SAID THEY SUPPORT. DID YOU

02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:44.750
DID YOU WANT TO ADD JUST- TO

02:03:44.817 --> 02:03:46.519
YOUR QUESTION THAT THE JUDGE

02:03:46.585 --> 02:03:48.487
THE CALL MILLER FINDINGS ANY

02:03:48.554 --> 02:03:49.555
APPLIED EVERYTHING TO NATHAN

02:03:49.622 --> 02:03:50.556
AND TAKE EVERYTHING INTO

02:03:50.623 --> 02:03:52.391
CONSIDERATION ANYTHING SAT UP

02:03:52.458 --> 02:03:55.194
THERE AND SAID HE ENJOYED THE

02:03:55.261 --> 02:03:56.162
WAY IT SOUNDED LISTENING TO MY

02:03:56.228 --> 02:03:57.930
BROTHER'S BONES CRACKED WE'RE

02:03:57.997 --> 02:03:59.865
TALKING ABOUT A VERY DIFFERENT

02:03:59.932 --> 02:04:02.535
TYPE OF CRIMINAL HERE- AND

02:04:02.601 --> 02:04:04.103
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:05.871
THREE MORE RECENT SING HEARINGS

02:04:05.938 --> 02:04:07.139
AS THE LAW STATES RIGHT NOW.

02:04:07.206 --> 02:04:08.674
WHEN JUDGES AND APPELLATE

02:04:08.741 --> 02:04:10.309
JUDGES OF ALREADY DETERMINED

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:12.578
HIM TO BE IRREPARABLY CORRUPT

02:04:12.645 --> 02:04:14.079
SO ON TOP OF THOSE THREE RE

02:04:14.146 --> 02:04:16.182
SENTENCING HEARINGS WE ALSO

02:04:16.248 --> 02:04:17.716
HAVE THE INDEFINITE PAROLE

02:04:17.783 --> 02:04:20.019
BOARD HEARINGS IT IS NEVER ENDS

HOW CAN WE LIMIT THESE. FOR THE

02:04:24.123 --> 02:04:27.726
USE. THESE RARE JUVENILE

02:04:27.793 --> 02:04:29.261
OFFENDERS NOT THE PEOPLE WHO

WERE HERE TODAY WE BELIEVE IN

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:33.265
SECOND CHANCES BUT WE ALSO HAVE

02:04:33.332 --> 02:04:34.400
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE

02:04:34.466 --> 02:04:36.035
THOSE WHO WILL NEVER SHOW

02:04:36.101 --> 02:04:38.771
REMORSE THEY'RE INCAPABLE OF IT

02:04:38.838 --> 02:04:40.239
PSYCHOLOGICALLY. AND THEY ARE A

02:04:40.306 --> 02:04:42.107
CONTINUED THREAT THAT'S ALL

02:04:58.657 --> 02:05:00.593
REQUIRES THE DETERMINATION BY

02:05:00.659 --> 02:05:01.827
THE JUDGE FOR EVERY JUVENILE

02:05:01.894 --> 02:05:03.963
SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO BE

02:05:04.029 --> 02:05:06.165
MADE AT THE OUTSET TO BE MADE

02:05:06.232 --> 02:05:08.767
AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME WHEN

02:05:08.834 --> 02:05:09.768
EVEN MILLER THE UNITED THAT THE

02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:11.337
SUPREME COURT A MILLER SAYS.

02:05:11.403 --> 02:05:12.805
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THAT

02:05:12.872 --> 02:05:15.808
DETERMINATION AT THE OUTSET-

02:05:15.875 --> 02:05:17.610
AND IN MOST ALMOST CERTAINLY HE

02:05:17.676 --> 02:05:19.111
WOULD HAVE BEEN. FOUND TO BE A

02:05:19.178 --> 02:05:20.613
REPLICA BECAUSE WHAT HOW DO WE

02:05:20.679 --> 02:05:21.213
KNOW WHAT SOMEONE'S GOING TO

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:22.548
LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY'RE TWENTY

02:05:22.615 --> 02:05:23.849
FIVE OR THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE

02:05:23.916 --> 02:05:25.351
THAT IS THE TEACHING. OF THE

02:05:25.417 --> 02:05:26.886
SUPREME COURT CASES AND THE

02:05:26.952 --> 02:05:29.822
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASES

02:05:29.889 --> 02:05:33.259
AND. WHAT CURRENT LAW DOES IS

02:05:33.325 --> 02:05:35.494
ALLOW SOMEONE THE POSSIBILITY

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:37.496
TO GROW AND CHANGE AND BE

02:05:37.563 --> 02:05:39.498
INCENTIVIZE TO CHANGE AND THEN

02:05:39.565 --> 02:05:41.634
KEEP PUTS. THE DETERMINATION OF

02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:42.968
IRREPARABLE CORRUPTION MEANS

02:05:43.035 --> 02:05:44.770
THE CURRENT DANGERS IN DAYS

02:05:44.837 --> 02:05:46.338
GONE LEGAL STANDARD BUT IT'S A

02:05:46.405 --> 02:05:47.940
REBEL CORRUPTION NO ONE WHO IS

02:05:48.007 --> 02:05:49.041
A RAPPER THE CORRUPT. IS

02:05:49.108 --> 02:05:50.709
RELEASED FROM A CALIFORNIA

02:05:50.776 --> 02:05:51.810
PRISON THROUGH OUR PAROLE

02:05:51.877 --> 02:05:53.145
PROCESS IT PUTS THAT

02:05:53.212 --> 02:05:55.414
DETERMINATION IN THE HANDS OF

02:05:55.481 --> 02:05:57.416
EXPERTS WHO SPEND HOURS.

02:05:57.483 --> 02:05:59.218
QUESTIONING THE PERSON SEEKING

02:05:59.285 --> 02:06:01.954
PAROLE EVALUATING PSYCHOLOGICAL

02:06:02.021 --> 02:06:02.721
RECORDS FROM THE TIME THEY WERE

02:06:02.788 --> 02:06:03.589
JUVENILES AND CURRENT

02:06:03.656 --> 02:06:05.524
PSYCHOLOGICAL- DETERMINATIONS

02:06:05.591 --> 02:06:07.693
MADE BY THE PORTABLE WHO HAVE

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:08.994
EXPERIENCE IN CORRECTIONS

02:06:09.061 --> 02:06:10.429
EXPERIENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:06:10.496 --> 02:06:11.964
TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. THE

02:06:12.031 --> 02:06:14.300
REST THE RECIDIVISM RATE THE

02:06:14.366 --> 02:06:15.301
VIOLENT RECIDIVISM RATE FOR

02:06:15.367 --> 02:06:17.036
PEOPLE RELEASE WERE CALIFORNIA

02:06:17.102 --> 02:06:18.771
PRO PROCESS IS AROUND ONE

02:06:18.837 --> 02:06:20.739
PERCENT. SO WE'RE GETTING IT

02:06:20.806 --> 02:06:22.975
RIGHT. THAT THAT THAT THAT THE

02:06:23.042 --> 02:06:26.512
PEOPLE THAT THE MAN WHO TOOK

02:06:26.578 --> 02:06:28.080
HER BROTHER'S LIFE AND THAT TE

02:06:28.147 --> 02:06:28.647
RARE IF THERE'S THAT WE'RE

02:06:28.714 --> 02:06:29.581
TALKING ABOUT ARE NOT.

02:06:29.648 --> 02:06:31.817
RETURNING TO OUR SOCIETY

02:06:31.884 --> 02:06:34.954
THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA PROPOSES

02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:35.554
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THEY EVER

02:06:35.621 --> 02:06:36.155
WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO

02:06:36.221 --> 02:06:40.259
THAT. THE THAT COME CLOSE THEY

02:06:40.326 --> 02:06:43.529
ANSWERING YOUR FIRST QUESTION.

02:06:43.595 --> 02:06:45.965
YES THAT- DID YOU WATER PITCHER

02:06:46.031 --> 02:06:46.799
SECOND SO WE GET WHILE THE

02:06:46.865 --> 02:06:47.499
SECOND QUESTION MISTER CHAIR

02:06:47.566 --> 02:06:48.133
HAD TO DO WITH DUE PROCESS AND

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:49.068
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY

02:06:49.134 --> 02:06:50.402
HEARINGS ARE A FORM OF DUE

02:06:50.469 --> 02:06:54.440
PROCESS AND SO TAKING THAT AWAY

02:06:54.506 --> 02:06:56.508
ALSO IMPACTS ABILITY TO HAVE

02:06:56.575 --> 02:06:58.143
SUCH A SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO

02:06:58.210 --> 02:07:00.512
HAVE DUE PROCESS I ALSO WANT

02:07:00.579 --> 02:07:02.281
TO- TO SHARE SINCE WE- ABOUT

02:07:02.348 --> 02:07:03.615
MILLER V. ALABAMA THAT EVEN

02:07:03.682 --> 02:07:05.718
SCALIA OPINED IN THAT. RULING

02:07:05.784 --> 02:07:07.219
THAT FOR JUVENILE

02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:09.088
REHABILITATION AS A PRIORITY

02:07:09.154 --> 02:07:11.323
OVER PUNISHMENT BUT MY SECOND

02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:13.592
QUESTION HAD TO DO WITH DUE

02:07:13.659 --> 02:07:14.226
PROCESS AND IF THIS IS WOULD BE

02:07:14.293 --> 02:07:18.630
COMPROMISING THAT. SO I AGREE

02:07:18.697 --> 02:07:20.799
WITH WHAT- THE WITNESS JUST

02:07:20.866 --> 02:07:23.469
SAID EXCEPT FOR THE WHAT SHE

02:07:23.535 --> 02:07:26.238
SAID ABOUT MY BILL IS FALSE AND

02:07:26.305 --> 02:07:26.805
I'LL JUST READ FROM THE BILL

02:07:26.872 --> 02:07:29.375
AGAIN. THE COURT SHALL PROVIDE

02:07:29.441 --> 02:07:30.976
A DEFENDANT WHO IS UNDER

02:07:31.043 --> 02:07:31.810
EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE AT THE

02:07:31.877 --> 02:07:33.245
TIME OF THE COMMISSION OF THE

02:07:33.312 --> 02:07:34.546
OFFENSE FOR WHICH THE DEFENDANT

02:07:34.613 --> 02:07:35.447
WAS SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:37.549
THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. WITH

02:07:37.616 --> 02:07:38.951
A RE SENTENCING HEARING

02:07:39.018 --> 02:07:40.119
ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THIS

02:07:40.185 --> 02:07:42.121
PARAGRAPH AND THE TERMS OF WHAT

CONSIDERED. SO SAYING THAT MY

02:07:45.991 --> 02:07:47.026

REDEMPTION IS 1100% FALSE. AND

02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:52.998
IT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES

WE SUPPORT THAT. WE'RE SAYING

02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:08.347

WE CLOSE THAT GAP IF THERE'S A

02:15:55.347 --> 02:15:55.881
PROBLEM. TO THAT'S- THAT SEEMS

02:15:55.947 --> 02:15:59.150

BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE

02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:02.260
OF LEGISLATION AND I THINK IT'S

02:25:02.326 --> 02:25:02.894
REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND.

02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.195
HOW WE GOT HERE IN THE FIRST

02:25:04.262 --> 02:25:07.031
PLACE- FOR DECADES IF YOU HAD A

02:25:07.098 --> 02:25:08.166
CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT IN THE

02:25:08.232 --> 02:25:10.068
CITY CALIFORNIA COULD CARRY. ON

02:25:10.134 --> 02:25:11.903
PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND

02:25:11.969 --> 02:25:13.805
NEVER ONCE THAT I'M AWARE OF

02:25:13.871 --> 02:25:14.872
THAT WE HAVE A CCW HOLDER THE

02:25:14.939 --> 02:25:18.676
KASSON ISSUE. FAST FORWARD TO

02:25:18.743 --> 02:25:19.310
TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH THE PASSAGE

02:25:19.377 --> 02:25:20.978
OF AB SEVEN OH SEVEN THAT SAID

02:25:21.045 --> 02:25:23.014
CCW HOLDERS ARE NOT A LOT OF

02:25:23.081 --> 02:25:24.215
PUBLIC PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND LAST

02:25:24.282 --> 02:25:26.217
THERE IS PERMISSION. AND THEN

02:25:26.284 --> 02:25:28.853
PASSWORD AGAIN TWO YEARS LATER-

02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:30.188
BECAUSE SOME OF THAT DISCRETION

02:25:30.254 --> 02:25:32.390
WAS ACTUALLY ALLOWING CCW

02:25:32.457 --> 02:25:33.057
HOLDERS TO CONTINUE TO CARRY ON

02:25:33.124 --> 02:25:35.760
THE SCHOOLS- WE HAVE THE

02:25:35.827 --> 02:25:36.360
PASSAGE OF AB FOR TWENTY FOUR

02:25:36.427 --> 02:25:38.229
WHICH JUST IS A FLAT OUT BàN.

02:25:38.296 --> 02:25:39.197
BUT ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF

02:25:39.263 --> 02:25:41.699
THAT BILL WAS CHURCHES. THERE

02:25:41.766 --> 02:25:43.634
ARE CHURCHES AND OTHER

02:25:43.701 --> 02:25:44.502
RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS THAT

02:25:44.569 --> 02:25:46.037
HAVE PRIVATE SCHOOLS ASSOCIATED

02:25:46.104 --> 02:25:48.306
WITH IT. OR WHEN SCHOOL NOT IN

02:25:48.372 --> 02:25:49.540
SESSION OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS THEIR

02:25:49.607 --> 02:25:50.441
MEETING THERE- FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:25:50.508 --> 02:25:51.642
CHURCH THAT I TEND. IS NOW

02:25:51.709 --> 02:25:53.511
UNDER SOME RENOVATIONS AND SO

02:25:53.578 --> 02:25:54.846
THEY'RE MEETING AT A LOCAL

02:25:54.912 --> 02:25:58.649
PUBLIC SCHOOL BUT BECAUSE OF

02:25:58.716 --> 02:26:01.586
CALIFORNIA LAW YOU CANNOT HAVE

02:26:01.652 --> 02:26:02.153
A CCW HOLDERS ON THAT SCHOOL

02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:04.856
CAMP. OUT BRING MAJOR MAJOR

02:26:04.922 --> 02:26:06.624
CRIMINAL PENALTIES- AND THERE'S

02:26:06.691 --> 02:26:08.059
ONLY VERY VERY MINOR EXCEPTIONS

02:26:08.126 --> 02:26:09.527
FOR. LAW ENFORCEMENT EXETER OF.

02:26:09.594 --> 02:26:10.261
AND SO WHAT THIS BILL IS IT'S

02:26:10.328 --> 02:26:11.496
VERY NARROW. AND IT'S SAYING

02:26:11.562 --> 02:26:12.797
DURING THE TIME OF THOSE

02:26:12.864 --> 02:26:14.565
RELIGIOUS SERVICES IF THERE'S

02:26:14.632 --> 02:26:16.234
PERMISSION FROM THE SCHOOL OF

02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:17.635
THE AUTHORITY THAT YOU CAN

02:26:17.702 --> 02:26:19.504
CARRY AND SO THE CHURCHES CAN

02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:21.739
THEN MAKE. IMPORTANT SECURITY

02:26:21.806 --> 02:26:23.941
DECISIONS SO- IF YOU YOU KNOW

02:26:24.008 --> 02:26:26.010
THE EXAMPLE OF TEXAS WAS USE

02:26:26.077 --> 02:26:27.478
RECENTLY WHERE YOU HAD SOMEONE

02:26:27.545 --> 02:26:30.281
ON SITE THERE WAS A VOLUNTEER

02:26:30.348 --> 02:26:34.085
WITH THE CHURCH IT WAS ABLE TO

02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:34.685
RESPOND TO A THREAT. IS IT THE

02:26:34.752 --> 02:26:39.290
TODAY. LAWS ARE NOT STOP

02:26:39.357 --> 02:26:40.491
ADMITTED FROM SEEING GUN FREE

02:26:40.558 --> 02:26:41.559
ZONES. OR AREAS THAT THEY'RE

02:26:41.626 --> 02:26:42.226
SUPPOSED. TO DID SPECIALLY WHEN

02:26:42.293 --> 02:26:43.127
THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT EVEN

02:26:43.194 --> 02:26:43.728
ALLOWED TO CARRY IN THE FIRST

02:26:43.794 --> 02:26:44.896
PLACE. AND SO- THIS IS JUST A

02:26:44.962 --> 02:26:45.496
VERY VERY NARROW CARVE OUT FOR

02:26:45.563 --> 02:26:47.031
THESE RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS.

02:26:47.098 --> 02:26:48.566
DURING THE TIME OF WORSHIP. I'M

02:26:48.633 --> 02:26:50.234
IN ALSO COMES DOWN TO PRIVATE

02:26:50.301 --> 02:26:51.636
PROPERTY- ISSUE SOME OF THESE

02:26:51.702 --> 02:26:53.337
ARE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS OR

02:26:53.404 --> 02:26:55.072
PRIVATE SCHOOLS. AND WE'RE

02:26:55.139 --> 02:26:57.375
DICTATING HOW THEY CAN- MAKE

02:26:57.441 --> 02:26:58.776
THEIR IMPORTANT SECURITY

02:26:58.843 --> 02:27:00.344
DECISIONS AND SO. I THINK THIS

02:27:00.411 --> 02:27:01.579
IS A GREAT BILL IT'S VERY

02:27:01.646 --> 02:27:02.980
NARROW. IT LOOKS BACK AT THE

02:27:03.047 --> 02:27:07.985

FIREARMS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS

OWNS IS CONTRARY TO THE NEED

02:27:59.537 --> 02:28:00.705
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE

02:28:00.771 --> 02:28:02.807
PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN YOUTH

02:28:02.873 --> 02:28:03.374
AND THE COMMUNITY FROM GUN

02:28:03.441 --> 02:28:05.676

02:30:20.478 --> 02:30:21.879
ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO CARRY

02:30:21.946 --> 02:30:23.748
GUNS I NOT THE SOLUTION BUT WE

02:30:23.814 --> 02:30:25.816
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON

02:30:25.883 --> 02:30:26.951
HOW WE GET GUNS OUT OF THE

02:30:27.017 --> 02:30:27.685
HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T

02:30:27.752 --> 02:30:29.220

ABOUT IT SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK.

02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:43.734
BUT THAT AND THAT'S WHY I WAS A

02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:45.302
HUGE PROPONENT WITH THE JEWISH

02:30:45.369 --> 02:30:46.170
CAUCUS OF THE NONPROFIT

02:30:46.237 --> 02:30:48.773
SECURITY GRANTS THAT WE- WERE

02:30:48.839 --> 02:30:51.242
ABLE TO PASS THIS YEAR- THEY

02:30:51.308 --> 02:30:52.176
WERE ZEROED OUT. IN THE BUDGET

02:30:52.243 --> 02:30:53.244
THAT WAS INTRODUCED EARLIER

02:30:53.310 --> 02:30:55.346
THIS WEEK AND SO I URGE US ALL

02:30:55.413 --> 02:30:55.946
TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE WE

02:30:56.013 --> 02:30:57.548
CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE SAFETY

02:30:57.615 --> 02:31:00.551
OF. CONGREGATIONS OF ALL FAITHS

02:31:00.618 --> 02:31:01.152
THROUGH THAT PROGRAM. BUT THAT

02:31:01.218 --> 02:31:03.621
THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION. YES

02:31:03.687 --> 02:31:07.625
ANYONE ELSE. YES MISTER QUIRK

02:31:07.691 --> 02:31:10.161
YEAH- WE HAVE VERY GOOD

02:31:10.227 --> 02:31:11.495
EVIDENCE THE MORE PEOPLE HAVE

02:31:11.562 --> 02:31:13.497
GUNS THE MORE OUR GUN DEATHS

02:31:13.564 --> 02:31:16.000
THERE ARE BOB AND IF YOU LOOK

02:31:16.066 --> 02:31:17.635
AT TEXAS VERSUS CALIFORNIA

02:31:17.701 --> 02:31:20.704
FARMER GUN DEATHS ARE EVEN IF

02:31:20.771 --> 02:31:24.408
YOU WERE TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT

02:31:24.475 --> 02:31:27.278
A DEATH AT A SCHOOL THIS WAY A

02:31:27.344 --> 02:31:28.646
YOU WOULD HAVE FAR MORE GUN

02:31:28.712 --> 02:31:30.948
DEATHS IF WE WERE TO OPEN THIS

02:31:31.015 --> 02:31:33.751
UP- YOU CAN EVEN SEE THAT FOR

02:31:33.818 --> 02:31:36.320
EXAMPLE SAN FRANCISCO ON A PER

02:31:36.387 --> 02:31:38.823
PERSON BASIS AS FEWER GUN

02:31:38.889 --> 02:31:41.258
DEATHS. VAN THE RED COUNTIES

02:31:41.325 --> 02:31:43.828
WHERE C. C. W.'S ARE GIVEN MORE

02:31:43.894 --> 02:31:46.397
OFTEN SO I JUST CANNOT DO I

02:31:46.464 --> 02:31:49.133
WILL NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT

02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:49.700
LOOSENS UP OUR- GUN CONTROL

02:31:49.767 --> 02:31:54.371
BILLS. MR LACKEY. YEAH I THINK

02:31:54.438 --> 02:31:56.307
I MIGHT HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

02:31:56.373 --> 02:31:56.941
TO TRY TO BRING BALANCE TO THIS

02:31:57.007 --> 02:31:59.743
DISCUSSION. THAT THERE IS

02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:01.846
ACTUALLY A ROLE. FOR WEAPONS TO

02:32:01.912 --> 02:32:05.749
BE USED AS DEFENSIVE.

02:32:05.816 --> 02:32:07.017
CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT IS

02:32:07.084 --> 02:32:09.053
CLEARLY THE CASE THE SUN

02:32:09.119 --> 02:32:11.555
AUTHORS TRYING TO PRESENT. GUNS

02:32:11.622 --> 02:32:15.526
ARE. EVERYBODY WANTS TO

02:32:15.593 --> 02:32:19.363
GENERALIZE GUNS IN THE ABUSIVE

02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:19.997
CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE SHOULD PAY

02:32:20.064 --> 02:32:24.301
ATTENTION TO THAT. BUT. EVEN

02:32:24.368 --> 02:32:26.136
THE TERM GUN VIOLENCE IS

02:32:26.203 --> 02:32:28.839
DISTURBING TO ME BECAUSE IT IT

02:32:28.906 --> 02:32:29.807
FOCUSES ON THE WEAPON AND NOT

02:32:29.874 --> 02:32:32.042
THE BEHAVIOR BEHIND IT AND I

02:32:32.109 --> 02:32:32.943
THINK THAT THAT'S MISSING THE

02:32:33.010 --> 02:32:35.079
MARK TERRIBLY AND I THINK WHO

02:32:35.145 --> 02:32:37.915
CARRIES THE GUN. IS WHAT

02:32:37.982 --> 02:32:39.149
DEFINES FOR THAT GUN AS A

02:32:39.216 --> 02:32:42.520
THREAT OR WHETHER IT'S- A TOOL.

02:32:42.586 --> 02:32:44.388
TO DEFEND THE INNOCENT. AND I

02:32:44.455 --> 02:32:45.856
THINK CLEARLY WHAT WE HAVE

02:32:45.923 --> 02:32:48.926
HERE. IS A PROCESS THAT'S BEEN

02:32:48.993 --> 02:32:51.395
PROPOSED THAT WE WOULD. ASSURE

02:32:51.462 --> 02:32:51.896
THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE

02:32:51.962 --> 02:32:54.798
CARRYING THE GUN. ARE THERE TO

02:32:54.865 --> 02:32:57.001
PROTECT THE INNOCENT. AND NOT

02:32:57.067 --> 02:32:59.303
TO USE AN OFFENSIVE WEAPON I

02:32:59.370 --> 02:32:59.870
CARRIED A WEAPON FOR TWENTY

02:32:59.937 --> 02:33:03.774
EIGHT YEARS OF MY SIDE. LOADED

02:33:03.841 --> 02:33:06.143
AND I WAS FULLY TRAINED AND IT

02:33:06.210 --> 02:33:08.145
SAVED ME FROM HAPPEN TO USE

02:33:08.212 --> 02:33:12.850
VIOLENCE IT SAVED ME FROM

02:33:12.917 --> 02:33:13.450
ENGAGING IN A PEOPLE WHO WERE

02:33:13.517 --> 02:33:18.222
ARMED. AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT

02:33:18.289 --> 02:33:19.924
TO OVER GENERALIZE GUNS AS THE

02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:22.993
DEMON. IS MISDIRECTED. IT'S THE

02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:24.028
BEHAVIOR BEHIND THE GUN THAT

02:33:24.094 --> 02:33:26.063
NEEDS FOCUS AND THAT'S WHAT

02:33:26.130 --> 02:33:26.931
YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE

02:33:26.997 --> 02:33:28.299

02:33:37.241 --> 02:33:38.509
IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO

02:33:38.576 --> 02:33:42.046
KEEP COMMUNITIES SAFE- I DO

02:33:42.112 --> 02:33:45.416
ALSO AGREE HOWEVER WITH- THE

02:33:45.482 --> 02:33:46.951
OPPOSITION AND SOME OF MY

02:33:47.017 --> 02:33:48.085
FELLOW COLLEAGUES ALL OF MY

02:33:48.152 --> 02:33:49.987
COLLEAGUES ON THE DíAS- IN

02:33:50.054 --> 02:33:52.790
SOME FORM OR ANOTHER. FOR ME

02:33:52.856 --> 02:33:54.291
THE QUESTIONS- BEHIND THIS

02:33:54.358 --> 02:33:57.928
BILL. OUR OUR MINI ONE- SORT OF

02:33:57.995 --> 02:34:00.197
CHALLENGING THE LIABILITY AND

02:34:00.264 --> 02:34:01.565
WHO ACTUALLY HAS A LIABILITY ON

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:03.567
PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THERE THEN

02:34:03.634 --> 02:34:05.035
ALSO BECOMES A QUESTION OF THE

02:34:05.102 --> 02:34:06.604
SUBJECTIVITY OF THE PERSON

02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:09.406
AUTHORIZING THE USE I MEAN. YOU

02:34:09.473 --> 02:34:11.775
KNOW THE PEOPLE ARE WOULD BE

02:34:11.842 --> 02:34:13.510
GRANTING THE AUTHORITY FOR

02:34:13.577 --> 02:34:14.445
SOMEONE TO COME ON TO. MY

02:34:14.511 --> 02:34:16.347
CAMPUS ARMED AND THEY'RE A

02:34:16.413 --> 02:34:18.349
SUBJECTIVITY IN THAT PERSON

02:34:18.415 --> 02:34:19.550
THAT SUPERINTENDENTS ABILITY TO

02:34:19.617 --> 02:34:21.552
MAKE A DECISION OR

02:34:21.619 --> 02:34:25.189
DETERMINATION AND IF- BIAS OR

02:34:25.255 --> 02:34:26.757
SORT OF PROFILING CREEPS INTO

02:34:26.824 --> 02:34:28.359
THAT AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY

02:34:28.425 --> 02:34:29.426
IT'S JUST A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE

02:34:29.493 --> 02:34:31.095
FOR ME AND TO HAVE A

02:34:31.161 --> 02:34:32.596
CONVERSATION ABOUT PRIVATE

02:34:32.663 --> 02:34:34.598
MILITIA. AND THAT IS SOMETHING

02:34:34.665 --> 02:34:37.134
THAT IS INCREDIBLY SCARY TO ME-

02:34:37.201 --> 02:34:39.937
AS A BLACK WOMAN AS A PARENT-

02:34:40.004 --> 02:34:43.774
AS A WIFE- IN AS A NEIGHBOR-

02:34:43.841 --> 02:34:47.978
MANY OF THE- HOUSES OF WORSHIP

02:34:48.045 --> 02:34:52.916
THAT ARE RENTING SPACES ON OUR

02:34:52.983 --> 02:34:57.855
SKIN IS. CUTER. COMMUTER HAVE.

02:34:57.921 --> 02:34:58.789
BEEN IS THE OUT. IS THE

02:34:58.856 --> 02:34:59.823
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT. AND

02:34:59.890 --> 02:35:00.524
THE NEIGHBORHOOD IF THOSE-

02:35:00.591 --> 02:35:01.158
HOMES OF HOUSES OF WORSHIP NO

02:35:01.225 --> 02:35:01.725
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY

02:35:01.792 --> 02:35:02.359
LIVING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND

02:35:02.426 --> 02:35:03.961
HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHO

02:35:04.028 --> 02:35:05.729
MAY BE SPECIAL NEEDS ARE WHO

02:35:05.796 --> 02:35:08.165
WAS A LITTLE QUIRKY AND THEN

02:35:08.232 --> 02:35:08.632
YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE

02:35:08.699 --> 02:35:11.402
GUARDING- IN THESE- PLACES OF

02:35:11.468 --> 02:35:13.137
WORSHIP NOT REALLY KNOWING THE

02:35:13.203 --> 02:35:14.772
INTRICACIES AND THE NEW WANTS

02:35:14.838 --> 02:35:16.974
OF THIS COMMUNITY. OUT WHO ARE

02:35:17.041 --> 02:35:17.841
LOADED IN ARMED AND THEN BAD

02:35:17.908 --> 02:35:18.442
THINGS HAPPEN SO FOR ME THEIR

02:35:18.509 --> 02:35:20.444
JUST SO MANY QUESTIONS. THAT

02:35:20.511 --> 02:35:23.814
THIS RAISES RATHER THAN ANSWERS

02:35:23.881 --> 02:35:24.415
THAT I UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT

02:35:24.481 --> 02:35:29.253
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. WITH THAT

02:35:29.319 --> 02:35:30.587
YOU MAY CLOSE YOUR THANK YOU

02:35:30.654 --> 02:35:31.588
MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOW THIS

02:35:31.655 --> 02:35:32.456
BILL TO BE HEARD AGAIN I THINK

02:35:32.523 --> 02:35:34.158
THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL.

02:35:34.224 --> 02:35:35.893
MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'RE

02:35:35.959 --> 02:35:37.494
TRYING TO DO HERE. YOU KNOW AND

02:35:37.561 --> 02:35:38.996
I RESPECTFULLY HAVE TO

02:35:39.063 --> 02:35:40.030
COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH THE

02:35:40.097 --> 02:35:41.465
OPPOSITION ON ON SOME OF THESE

02:35:41.532 --> 02:35:44.468
ISSUES. BECAUSE A FIREARM. IN A

02:35:44.535 --> 02:35:46.670
TRAINED INDIVIDUALS HANDS. IS

02:35:46.737 --> 02:35:48.639
FAR MORE EFFECTIVE THAN WAITING

02:35:48.706 --> 02:35:50.140
ON LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET THERE

02:35:50.207 --> 02:35:52.076
IN OUR AREA OUR RESPONSE TIMES

02:35:52.142 --> 02:35:53.477
ARE ANYWHERE BETWEEN SIX. AND

02:35:53.544 --> 02:35:54.945
NINE MINUTES BEFORE LAW

02:35:55.012 --> 02:35:55.846
ENFORCEMENT CAN GET THERE.

02:35:55.913 --> 02:35:56.814
THERE'S A LOT OF DAMAGE THAT

02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:58.849
CAN BE DONE. WHAT WE'RE TALKING

02:35:58.916 --> 02:36:01.151
ABOUT HERE. IS A CHURCH.

02:36:01.218 --> 02:36:03.721
CONNECTED TO A SCHOOL. THAT WAS

02:36:03.787 --> 02:36:05.489
AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I DO

02:36:05.556 --> 02:36:05.989
BELIEVE OF THE PREVIOUS

02:36:06.056 --> 02:36:07.124
LEGISLATION THAT WAS NOT

02:36:07.191 --> 02:36:08.625
THOUGHT THROUGH. BECAUSE NOW

02:36:08.692 --> 02:36:10.394
THAT CHURCH DOES NOT HAVE THE

02:36:10.461 --> 02:36:11.995
ABILITY ALREADY PUT IN PLACE

02:36:12.062 --> 02:36:13.430
SECURITY TEAMS DO NOT HAVE THE

02:36:13.497 --> 02:36:14.598
ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR

02:36:14.665 --> 02:36:16.333
CONGREGATIONS. SO WHEN THEY'RE

02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:18.135
ALL FACING THE PEWS FOR THE

02:36:18.202 --> 02:36:18.736
FACING THE PASTOR. THEIR BACKS

02:36:18.802 --> 02:36:21.939
TO THE DOOR. AND THERE'S NOBODY

02:36:22.005 --> 02:36:23.006
LOOKING OUT FOR. AND WE KNOW

02:36:23.073 --> 02:36:24.775
THIS WORLD GONE A LITTLE CRAZY.

02:36:24.842 --> 02:36:26.276
BUT I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW

02:36:26.343 --> 02:36:28.145
THIS BILL IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS

02:36:28.212 --> 02:36:30.247
THAT CAN ABSOLUTELY SAVE LIVES.

02:36:30.314 --> 02:36:31.849
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S-

02:36:31.915 --> 02:36:34.451
IT'S- STILL HARD FOR SOME MY

02:36:34.518 --> 02:36:35.052
COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE

02:36:35.119 --> 02:36:36.120
OUT TO SUPPORT THESE KINDS OF

02:36:36.186 --> 02:36:37.755
BILLS. BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

02:36:37.821 --> 02:36:39.323
BILLS THAT I FUNDAMENTALLY

02:36:39.389 --> 02:36:40.858
BELIEVE. IF WE DON'T DO

02:36:40.924 --> 02:36:41.458
SOMETHING SOON IN THE STATE OF

02:36:41.525 --> 02:36:44.862
CALIFORNIA. IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

02:36:44.928 --> 02:36:45.696
AND THEN WE'RE ALL GONNA BLAME

02:36:45.763 --> 02:36:48.365
THE GUNS AS OPPOSED TO ALLOWING

02:36:48.432 --> 02:36:51.602
GOOD GUYS TO BE THERE GOOD GUYS

02:36:51.668 --> 02:36:54.071
TO BE ON STAFF GOOD GUYS TO BE

02:36:54.138 --> 02:36:55.239
ON SITE TO PROTECT THE CONTENTS

02:36:55.305 --> 02:36:57.508
THE COMMUNITY WE ALL TALK ABOUT

02:36:57.574 --> 02:36:58.709
WE WANNA DO EVERYTHING FOR

02:36:58.776 --> 02:37:00.477
COMMITTEES TO BE SAFE HEALTHY

02:37:00.544 --> 02:37:02.279
WE DO TONS OF LEGISLATION TO DO

02:37:02.346 --> 02:37:04.882
THIS. BUT NOW WE'RE CREATING

02:37:04.948 --> 02:37:07.217
SOFT TARGETS WERE ADVERTISING

02:37:07.284 --> 02:37:07.851
TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO PEOPLE

02:37:07.918 --> 02:37:11.622
HARM. THAT WE CAN'T HAVE GUNS

02:37:11.688 --> 02:37:12.256
AT THIS PLACE IF YOU WANT TO GO

02:37:12.322 --> 02:37:12.790
AND PUT THE MOST DAMAGE GO

02:37:12.856 --> 02:37:14.558
THERE. BECAUSE COPTERS SIX

02:37:14.625 --> 02:37:18.228
MINUTES AWAY. WERE ADVERTISING

02:37:18.295 --> 02:37:20.063
THIS WE'RE GIVING THEM JUST

02:37:20.130 --> 02:37:20.531
FREE REIN ON US ON OUR

02:37:20.597 --> 02:37:23.767
COMMUNITY. SO I'M JUST SAYING I

02:37:23.834 --> 02:37:25.702
UNDERSTAND THIS IS HARD AND IS

02:37:25.769 --> 02:37:26.403
THERE'S A REASON THIS BILL BEEN

02:37:26.470 --> 02:37:28.138
HERE FOR THREE YEARS OKAY. AND

02:37:28.205 --> 02:37:30.541
IT'S BEEN A GREAT DISCUSSION.

02:37:30.607 --> 02:37:31.775
AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH

02:37:31.842 --> 02:37:32.943
THE AUTHOR WE'VE WE'VE TALKED A

02:37:33.010 --> 02:37:35.112
LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW AND IF

02:37:35.179 --> 02:37:36.713
THERE IS ADDITIONAL TRAINING.

YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO THE CCW

02:37:38.749 --> 02:37:40.584
PERMIT HOLDERS IF THERE IS A

02:37:40.651 --> 02:37:42.319
WAY THAT WE CAN GET INTO SOME

02:37:42.386 --> 02:37:44.621
OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS I'M OPEN

02:37:44.688 --> 02:37:45.222
TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. BUT

02:37:45.289 --> 02:37:47.124
IF WE DO NOT DO SOMETHING. IT'S

02:37:47.191 --> 02:37:48.592
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME. AND

02:37:48.659 --> 02:37:50.260
THERE'S DATA UPON DATA THAT

02:37:50.327 --> 02:37:51.428
SHOWS WHEN GOOD PEOPLE HAVE

02:37:51.495 --> 02:37:53.897
GUNS. BAD PEOPLE ARE STOP

02:37:53.964 --> 02:37:54.431
QUICKER. AND THAT IS JUST

02:37:54.498 --> 02:37:57.301

THE AT THE. BUT THE CRUX OF IT

02:38:04.374 --> 02:38:10.013
IS THE WHO. I REALLY IS TO END

02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:13.350

THE WEAPONS THEN THE WHO AND

02:38:15.953 --> 02:38:20.090
THE REASON I SAY THAT. WE'RE

WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW DO

02:38:21.658 --> 02:38:24.761

CONGREGANTS CAN AFFORD TO HIRE.

02:38:38.041 --> 02:38:41.745
WELL TRAINED SECURITY OFFICERS

02:38:41.812 --> 02:38:44.781
TO PROTECT THE CONGREGANTS.

02:50:03.226 --> 02:50:04.994
CONCERN WITH THE BILL AGAIN IF

02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:25.982
THE STUFF. BUT JUST SO I JUST

02:50:26.049 --> 02:50:29.819
WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT. THAT.

02:50:29.886 --> 02:50:30.987

PRACTICES OR SOMETHING LIKE

02:50:41.564 --> 02:50:43.700
THAT. IT SAYS IT'S GOING TO

02:50:43.766 --> 02:50:45.702
REQUIRE THE AG TO DEVELOP A

02:50:45.768 --> 02:50:47.737
MODEL WRITTEN POLICY. FOR LAW

02:50:47.804 --> 02:50:49.973
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND

02:50:50.039 --> 02:50:50.773
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK

02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:53.443
TODAY ABOUT- THIS IS BUILDING

MAKING OTHER CHANGES THAT-

02:51:09.325 --> 02:51:11.894
WOULD BURDEN THE AG'S OFFICE.

US AND- WE THINK THAT IT'S A

02:51:20.269 --> 02:51:23.406
GOOD IDEA TO ALLOW LOCAL

02:51:23.473 --> 02:51:25.208
AGENCIES TO BE IN CHARGE OF

02:51:25.274 --> 02:51:27.777
THEIR OWN POLICIES AS LONG AS

02:51:27.844 --> 02:51:28.911

SAN FRANCISCO AND SEATTLE WERE

02:56:09.892 --> 02:56:10.826

CITIES COULD EVOLVE IN THIS

02:56:26.275 --> 02:56:28.444

AND SO THEY COULD GO TO THE-

02:56:37.787 --> 02:56:40.022
ATTORNEY GENERAL. IT'S OFFICE

02:56:40.089 --> 02:56:40.923

02:56:40.990 --> 02:56:43.059
ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EXACT BACK

02:56:43.125 --> 02:56:44.360

THAT THEY MAKE CHANGES AND I

02:56:50.433 --> 02:56:50.967
WOULD SAY THAT MAYES THINGS

02:56:51.033 --> 02:56:53.869
WERE EMBRACED BY OUR LOCAL.

02:56:53.936 --> 02:56:54.437
POLICE IN AS WELL SO WASN'T

02:56:54.503 --> 02:56:57.440
ALWAYS ADVERSARIAL. ALL RIGHT

02:56:57.506 --> 02:56:57.940
SO I DON'T SEE ANYTHING

02:56:58.007 --> 02:57:02.712
MANDATORY- ABOUT THIS IN THE

02:57:02.778 --> 02:57:05.848
SENSE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO.

02:57:05.915 --> 02:57:08.584
LOOK WE WERE VERY CAREFUL AND

02:57:08.651 --> 02:57:12.288
IN FACT I IN THIS COMMITTEE

02:57:12.355 --> 02:57:15.524
WHEN WE DID OUR LEFT THE- LET

02:57:15.591 --> 02:57:17.526
THE BILL GO FORWARD WE SAID

02:57:17.593 --> 02:57:18.527
SPECIFICALLY THAT THERE HAVE TO

02:57:18.594 --> 02:57:21.130
BE CHANGES. AND THERE WERE

02:57:21.197 --> 02:57:23.432
CHANGES AND I DON'T THINK THAT

02:57:23.499 --> 02:57:26.102
WE WOULD JUST HAVE LONG ARM

02:57:26.168 --> 02:57:28.971
ADOPT. ADOPT A RECOMMENDATION

02:57:29.038 --> 02:57:30.940
BECAUSE IT'S MADE BY THIS TASK

02:57:31.007 --> 02:57:32.074
FORCE SO I THINK THEY'RE

02:57:32.141 --> 02:57:36.579
SUFFICIENT- CLARITY HERE- BUT

02:57:36.645 --> 02:57:38.547
AGAIN IF THE AUTHOR WILL WORK

02:57:38.614 --> 02:57:41.951
WITH THE OPPOSITION AS HE SAID-

02:57:42.018 --> 02:57:42.551
PERHAPS WE CAN MAKE THAT EVEN

02:57:42.618 --> 02:57:46.856
MORE CLEAR THANK YOU. I HAVE

02:57:46.922 --> 02:57:49.592
SOME SELECTIONS FIRST OF ALL. I

02:57:49.658 --> 02:57:50.559
THINK THAT THIS IS VERY

02:57:50.626 --> 02:57:52.161
TROUBLING AS IT STANDS RIGHT

02:57:52.228 --> 02:57:54.096
NOW THERE'S JUST A LOT MORE

02:57:54.163 --> 02:57:54.597
QUESTIONS AND THERE ARE

02:57:54.663 --> 02:57:55.398
CLARIFICATIONS FIRST OF ALL. IF

02:57:55.464 --> 02:57:58.367
I CAN ASK YOUR- BECAUSE IT'S

02:57:58.434 --> 02:58:00.569
VERY VERY VAGUE. WHO'S GONNA BE

02:58:00.636 --> 02:58:08.177
ON THIS TASK FORCE. YEAH. THE

02:58:08.244 --> 02:58:11.614
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE CAME

02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:12.848
UP WITH THESE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:58:12.915 --> 02:58:14.483
LAST YEAR WHEN THEY WANTED TO

02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:17.153
LOOK AT THEIR BEST PRACTICES SO

02:58:17.219 --> 02:58:17.820
THEY WOULD BRING IN LAW

02:58:17.887 --> 02:58:19.822
ENFORCEMENT THEY WOULD BRING IN

02:58:19.889 --> 02:58:21.190
YOU KNOW POLICY EXPERTS THEY

02:58:21.257 --> 02:58:24.960
WOULD BRING IN- ACADEMICS-

02:58:25.027 --> 02:58:26.729
THEIR OWN DIVISION AND THAT'S

02:58:26.796 --> 02:58:28.064
WE HAVE ASSURANCES TOLD THAT

02:58:28.130 --> 02:58:29.198
THIS IS GOING TO BE A BALANCE

02:58:29.265 --> 02:58:31.567
TASK FORCE BECAUSE WHAT WHAT

02:58:31.634 --> 02:58:33.335
WHAT MY FEAR IS THERE IS A WILL

02:58:33.402 --> 02:58:35.438
HAVE PEOPLE. THAT AREN'T

02:58:35.504 --> 02:58:36.939
UNDERSTANDING THE ACTUAL

02:58:37.006 --> 02:58:39.308
TRAINING THE GOES AND ALL THE

02:58:39.375 --> 02:58:42.845
PARAMETERS THAT. LAW

02:58:42.912 --> 02:58:45.848
ENFORCEMENT ARE TAUGHT AND

02:58:45.915 --> 02:58:47.049
THAT'S INTEGRATED IN THEIR

02:58:47.116 --> 02:58:50.219
TRAINING. AND I THINK THAT THAT

02:58:50.286 --> 02:58:50.753
THAT CREATES A PROBLEM AND

02:58:50.820 --> 02:58:54.123
SECONDLY. I GET THE IMPRESSION

02:58:54.190 --> 02:58:56.092
AND I DON'T SAY THAT THAT'S IT

02:58:56.158 --> 02:58:58.294
YOUR INTENT BUT THIS COULD BE.

02:58:58.360 --> 02:58:59.962
CONSIDERED ANOTHER BITE OF THE

02:59:00.029 --> 02:59:01.263
APPLE YOU YOU ACTUALLY ON A

02:59:01.330 --> 02:59:03.165
VERY VERY DELICATE. AND IT WAS

02:59:03.232 --> 02:59:04.867
A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT TO

02:59:04.934 --> 02:59:06.268
ACTUALLY GET AB THREE NINETY

02:59:06.335 --> 02:59:08.671
TWO NSP TWO THIRTY- IN A

02:59:08.737 --> 02:59:10.206
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND

02:59:10.272 --> 02:59:12.975
EVERYBODY- CAME TOGETHER ON A

02:59:13.042 --> 02:59:13.943
VERY VERY SENSITIVE VERY

02:59:14.009 --> 02:59:15.411
DELICATE ISSUE AND I THINK THAT

02:59:15.478 --> 02:59:18.080
THIS IS. A RE OPENING. A VERY

02:59:18.147 --> 02:59:20.349
VERY- DIFFICULT SET OF

02:59:20.416 --> 02:59:22.151
CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE WE EVEN

02:59:22.218 --> 02:59:23.586
HAVE A CHANCE TO IMPLEMENT

02:59:23.652 --> 02:59:26.222
THREE NIGHT TWO INTO THIRTY.

02:59:26.288 --> 02:59:27.756
BECAUSE IT WHEN YOU WERE

02:59:27.823 --> 02:59:32.294
TALKING ABOUT. THE DIFFERENCE

02:59:32.361 --> 02:59:32.895
BETWEEN THE TASK FORCE AND THE

02:59:32.962 --> 02:59:35.698
REVIEW THEIR SEPARATE. RIGHT

02:59:35.764 --> 02:59:37.099
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:59:37.166 --> 02:59:37.700
REALLY NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED.

02:59:37.766 --> 02:59:40.503
OF. THE TASK FORCE IS NOT

02:59:40.569 --> 02:59:45.975
OPTIONAL. IT'S MANDATORY AND

02:59:46.041 --> 02:59:48.477
THE REVIEW IS OPTIONAL AND I'VE

02:59:48.544 --> 02:59:50.112
I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY

02:59:50.179 --> 02:59:52.848
VERY DANGEROUS GROUND AND IT

02:59:52.915 --> 02:59:55.885
PUTS THOSE OF US WHO. ARE

02:59:55.951 --> 02:59:56.485
TRYING TO CREATE BALANCE AND A

02:59:56.552 --> 03:00:00.256
VERY VERY. DELICATE VERY

03:00:00.322 --> 03:00:02.191
DELICATE DISCUSSION POINT AND I

03:00:02.258 --> 03:00:04.193
RESPECT BOTH SIDES OF THIS AND

03:00:04.260 --> 03:00:05.227
OF COURSE I LEAN OF ARE

03:00:05.294 --> 03:00:07.530
PROBABLY IN ANOTHER. CATEGORY

03:00:07.596 --> 03:00:08.664
THAN MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE I'VE

03:00:08.731 --> 03:00:10.633
ACTUALLY. BEEN ON THE OTHER

03:00:10.699 --> 03:00:13.169
SIDE SO BUT I THINK WE REALLY

03:00:13.235 --> 03:00:16.305
NEED TO BUILD. AND NOT. STIRRED

03:00:16.372 --> 03:00:18.741
UP AGAIN AND I THINK OF THIS AS

03:00:18.807 --> 03:00:20.409
A STRONG POTENTIAL TO DO THAT

03:00:20.476 --> 03:00:21.677
VERY THING AND I DON'T THINK

03:00:21.744 --> 03:00:22.912
