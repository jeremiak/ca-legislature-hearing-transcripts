FOR A LITTLE WHILE IS THAT I

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:57.127
REMEMBER BACK IN TWENTY

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:59.563

TRIED TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION

00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:19.650
SO HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK

00:45:19.716 --> 00:45:21.385
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DIVERT

00:45:21.452 --> 00:45:23.854
SO THAT- IN TO TRY TO REDUCE THE

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.355
BURDEN ON STATE HOSPITALS AND-

00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:26.423

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.992
BUT- I GUESS AND NOW AND NOW

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:30.828

THAT WE HAD ORIGINALLY DESIGNED

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.184

DIVERT THEM BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.950

IS THAT AS OF THE ACTUALLY A

00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:50.100
JUNE THIRD. WE HAVE SAID A LACK

ALL FELONY OR DAY IS A MIX OF

00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:37.648
THE TWO. SO THE- THEY SHOULD ALL

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:40.951

CHANGING NOT STATUTE ENACTED

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:15.385

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:25.329
REMAINDER. AND MISDEMEANOR THAT

00:49:25.395 --> 00:49:27.831
MIGHT BE ON THE LIST AND FROM

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:29.433
PRIOR TO THAT STATUTORY CHANGE

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:31.702
BUT IT SHOULD BE IN MAJORITY OF

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:33.670
THE VAST MAJORITY ARE AT LEAST

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:35.005
GOING FORWARD THEY'RE GOING TO

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:36.440
SPEAK SOMEBODY. EVEN ESTIMATES

00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:37.908
FOR ONLY A VERY SMALL FRACTION

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:39.376
OKAY I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:41.244
THAT'S THAT SO THEN THE NEXT

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:46.817
QUESTION I HAVE THEN. IS THAT-

00:49:46.883 --> 00:49:47.851
EIGHT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND

00:49:47.918 --> 00:49:48.919
THESE COMMITTEES NEED THAT- YOU

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:50.487
KNOW NEED TO PUT THE MONEY FIND

00:49:50.554 --> 00:49:51.855
HOW ITSELF. AND THEN YOU JUST BE

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:54.558
REALLY BLIND- TELLING THEIR BE

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:56.326
SOMETHING DOWN THIS. IS BECAUSE

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:58.362
YOU TALK ABOUT EVEN BAD IDEA.

00:49:58.428 --> 00:50:00.263
BOARD CARE ROOM. IS GOING TO

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:03.033
HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S EIGHT- YOU

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.668
KNOW I S. T. WELL THEN THAT'S

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:07.437
OUT THERE GARCIA RIGHT. D. THINK

00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.439
THERE'S TO BE ISSUES RELATED TO

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:11.641
FINDING SOME PLACES FOR THEM

00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:14.745
BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL COMMITTEE

00:50:14.811 --> 00:50:15.779
PUSH BACK. BECAUSE THESE ARE

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:21.618
AGAINST. BIAS. YEAH I DON'T

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:24.688
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE EASY- BUT

00:50:24.755 --> 00:50:26.189
YOU KNOW WE REALLY DO HAVE SOME

00:50:26.256 --> 00:50:27.924
VERY SUCCESSFUL MODELS WILL LOOK

00:50:27.991 --> 00:50:31.228
TO- LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE- I

00:50:31.294 --> 00:50:32.462
THINK AS YOU KNOW I MEAN THROW

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:33.930
IN THE END INVESTMENTS IN THE

00:50:33.997 --> 00:50:35.265
CAREERS WE ARE OPERATING IN

00:50:35.332 --> 00:50:36.733
PARTNERSHIP WITH ABOUT FIVE

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.669
HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN. BAD

00:50:39.736 --> 00:50:41.405
COMMUNITY BASED RESTORATION FOR

00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:43.940
THAT FELONY ASKING POPULATION

00:50:44.007 --> 00:50:46.076
PREDOMINANTLY THE MAJORITY OF

00:50:46.143 --> 00:50:48.111
THOSE BAGS ARE IN RESIDENTIAL

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:49.646
SETTINGS AND I THINK YOU KNOW

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:51.047
THE KEY TO THEIR SUCCESS IS

00:50:51.114 --> 00:50:53.150
RALLIED HOUSING PROVIDERS THAT

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:54.918
THEY DO WORK WITH YOU TO DO A

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:56.720
LOT OF FUN AND WORK IN TERMS OF

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:58.188
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE COMMUNITY

00:50:58.255 --> 00:51:00.791
AND SHARING WHAT WHAT SORT OF

00:51:00.857 --> 00:51:02.626
THE GOALS OF- AND TREATING THE

00:51:02.692 --> 00:51:05.695
POPULATION AND WHAT THEIR-

00:51:05.762 --> 00:51:08.265
STRIVING TO DO. AND SO IT IS

00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:09.433
THROUGH A LOT OF THAT THAT COULD

00:51:09.499 --> 00:51:11.368
WELL HARD WORK ON THE FRONT AND

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:15.172
THAT THAT HELPS TO- STRESSED OUT

00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:16.940
WHICH SHOWS RELATIONSHIPS THAT'S

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:17.974
WHAT WE GET OUT I THINK IT'S

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:19.509
IMPORTANT TO MONITOR I DON'T

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:21.111
MISS THIS AGREE WITH YOU I

00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:22.913
THINK- AND NO I WOULD SAY CAN

00:51:22.979 --> 00:51:25.248
YOU PLACE IT WOULD BE BETTER

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:26.116
ANYWAY BUT- I ALSO KNOW THE

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:29.986
REALITY OF SODA YEAH- OF THAT

00:51:30.053 --> 00:51:31.688
SOMETIMES. DO YOU YOU DO GET

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:33.523
PUSHED BACK AND- SO IT'S NOT A

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:34.958
SIMPLE SIMPLY- WE HAVE SOME

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:36.359
MONEY AND WE JUST NEED TO BUY

00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:38.462
SOME RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES OR

00:51:38.528 --> 00:51:40.464
WHATEVER IT'S A AND I NEED TO

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:48.538
YOU KNOW THAT. BUT- NO THERE'S A

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:49.673
TO BE DIVERSE. ON FIND WHAT THE

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.374
PER OF IT IS SO- IN THAT MAY

00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:52.476
MAKE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT. SO

00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:53.643
INTO OF TRYING TO MONITOR

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:54.911
WHAT'S- OF. YOUR PER. WE NEED TO

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:57.481
BE PAINT. AND THE OTHERS. I HAVE

00:51:57.547 --> 00:52:03.820
IS THAT- IN TERMS OF THE- HE

00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:05.655
SAID THERE'S A 13% INCREASING

00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:09.159
COURT REFERRALS- WHAT'S CAUSING

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:09.826
SILVA OF COURSE THAT'S THE

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:12.062
IMPORTANT PART RIGHT AND I GET

00:52:12.128 --> 00:52:13.129
THE IDEA OF PLAYING REFERRAL

00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:14.764
CAPS BUT IT'S NOT THE COUNTIES

00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:16.266
THAT MAKE THE DECISION UNLESS

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:17.701
UNLESS I GOT SOMETHING WRONG

00:52:17.767 --> 00:52:19.102
THAT SOMEONE GETS AN ICY

00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:21.838
REFERRAL IT'S A JUDGE FREIGHTERS

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:22.439
AND EVALUATION THE JUDGE SAYS

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:26.476
OKAY. AND SO WHAT WHAT'S DRIVING

00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:29.112
THAT 13% INCREASE IS THERE SOME

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:31.014
EDUCATION GOING ON WITH THE

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:33.250
JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:34.451
NORTH THINK ABOUT THAT DECISION

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:36.319
PASSED THE HOUSE ONE ENDS UP

00:52:36.386 --> 00:52:39.022
HERE AND- AND I APPRECIATE THAT

00:52:39.089 --> 00:52:40.123
THE REGIONAL PLAN WAS NOT JUST

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.826
TELL PEOPLE HONESTLY BUT PEOPLE

00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:45.929
POTENTIALLY BEYOND I. ESTY BUT-

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:48.965
SO. YEAH WELL ARE WE EVERY DAY

00:52:49.032 --> 00:52:51.134
THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE- INCREASE

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:52.335
IN COURT REFERRALS BECAUSE

00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:53.770
THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE PUT IN

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:55.438
PUT PRESSURE ON THE NUMBER OF

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:57.574
PEOPLE IN THE BACKLOG. AND IS

00:52:57.641 --> 00:52:59.009
EARLY ON AND ARE WE AND OTHERS

00:52:59.075 --> 00:53:00.610
PLAN TO HAVE A FIGURE OUT OF

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:02.479
DRESS THAT. ASIDE FROM SIMPLY

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:03.847
PUTTING A CAP ON THE COUNTY

00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:05.181
SUMMIT COUNTY UP CAP ON THERE

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:06.616
BUT THE COUNTY IS THE ONE YOU

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:07.851
MAKING DECISIONS. AS TO WHO'S

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:11.154
GETTING THAT WHO'S THE REFERRALS

00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:17.260
RIGHT. SO TO GET IT GOING TO

00:53:17.327 --> 00:53:19.429
TIGHT TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:21.865
POINTS RELATED. BEING I CAN'T

00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:23.967
TAKE A BREAK WITH THAT DO I'M

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:26.937
ABLE TO MAKES DISK. ON WHO- IS

00:53:27.003 --> 00:53:28.939
VERY COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:32.943
THAT IS- THAT IS- THE CASE AND

00:53:33.009 --> 00:53:35.645
ABOUT THE- INCREASE IN THE

00:53:35.712 --> 00:53:37.847
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE I.

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:40.483
S. T. IS REFLECTIVE. OF THE

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.652
INABILITY OR THE AND NUMBER OF

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:44.120
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GOING

00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:46.856
UNTREATED. AND TARGET NOT HAVE

00:53:46.923 --> 00:53:48.091
ACCESS TO TREATMENT OR UNDER

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:50.560
TREATED I'M IN THE COMMUNITY SO

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:52.462
THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN

00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:54.764
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE COURTS

00:53:54.831 --> 00:53:57.000
AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE BEING

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:57.901
PROVIDED IN THE BEHAVIORAL

00:53:57.968 --> 00:54:01.871
HEALTH CONTINUUM. SO WHILE THE-

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:03.073
COUNTIES THEMSELVES DO NOT

00:54:03.139 --> 00:54:05.008
DIRECTLY MAKE THE DECISION ON

00:54:05.075 --> 00:54:06.009
WHO IS COMMITTED TO THE

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:08.545
DEPARTMENT THERE IS A ROLE IN

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:12.415
DEAN- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AND-

00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:13.683
ENDING UP IN THE CRIMINAL

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.185
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THERE IS

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:16.820
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COUNTIES

00:54:16.886 --> 00:54:21.024
AND THE COURTS TO- TO COORDINATE

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.592
AND COLLABORATE AROUND

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:24.694
OPPORTUNITIES. FOR PRE TRIAL

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:26.196
DIVERSION OKAY REVERSION FROM

00:54:26.262 --> 00:54:28.298
THE ARRESTED THERE'S LOTS OF

00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:30.033
OPPORTUNITIES TO I DON'T THINK

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.868
SO AND IF I WHICH I THINK I GET

00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:33.336
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SO THEN I

00:54:33.403 --> 00:54:35.171
GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT- IS

00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:37.207
THAT 13% INCREASE HAPPENING

00:54:37.273 --> 00:54:38.942
BECAUSE THERE'S FEWER MENTAL

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:40.343
HEALTH OPPORTUNITIES IN THE

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:41.544
COUNTIES OF THEIR FOR THE JUDGES

00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:43.313
FEEL COMPELLED TO NOW REFER THEM

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:47.417
TO. TRY S. T. OR IS AT 13%

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:48.284
BECAUSE THEY CHANGE THEIR

00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:52.155
STANDARDS FOR WHO NEEDS I. S. T.

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:57.794
SO WHAT'S DRIVING. THIS INCREASE

00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:58.828
IN REFERRALS. THAT'S REALLY HARD

00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:00.997
TO DO SAY I MEAN THIS IS BEEN IN

00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:03.767
ON. YOUR OVER YEAR RIGHT YEAH IT

00:55:03.833 --> 00:55:06.069
PROBLEM I WE CERTAINLY HAVE DONE

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:07.737
OUR OWN LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT

00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:10.774
WE HAVE ON OUR SIDE TO SEE IF IT

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:14.310
WAS LARGE ONLY- ARE DRIVEN BY A

00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:16.279
SUBSTANCE ABUSE- DIFFERENT

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:18.048
THINGS AND POLICY ISSUES THAT

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:19.349
WE'VE HEARD OVER THE YEARS AND

00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:21.117
QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE HEARD AND-

00:55:21.184 --> 00:55:23.119
CERTAINLY HAVEN'T. SEEN ANY

00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:26.222
MAJOR DIRECT IDENTIFICATION OF

00:55:26.289 --> 00:55:29.993
WHAT IS CAUSING- THE POPULATION

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.195
pINDIVIDUALS INNING UP IN THE

00:55:32.262 --> 00:55:34.230
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. OTHER

00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:37.333
THAN AND ULTIMATELY THERE IS- WE

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.335
DEFINITELY DIDN'T LOOK AT DATA

00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:42.238
ANGLER AND- MASTER DATA TO THE

00:55:42.305 --> 00:55:43.707
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

00:55:43.773 --> 00:55:45.508
SERVICES MEDICAL RECORDS AND DID

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:47.744
SEE THAT NEARLY 50% WE'RE NOT

00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:50.647
ACCESSING THEIR SERVICES- WITHIN

00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:53.583
SIX MONTHS OF THEIR ARREST. 65%

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:55.552
OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT- COME

00:55:55.618 --> 00:55:57.087
INTO ISN'T AS INCOMPETENT TO

00:55:57.153 --> 00:55:58.888
STAND TRIAL WERE HOMELESS AT THE

00:55:58.955 --> 00:56:00.190
TME OF THEIR ARREST. SO THERE

00:56:00.256 --> 00:56:02.992
CERTAINLY INDICATORS OF WHAT IS

00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:06.329
CONTRIBUTING BUT- NO DIRAC'S YOU

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:08.665
KNOW. ANYTHING THAT DIRECTLY

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:11.101
SAYS THAT THIS IS ME- THE FACTOR

00:56:11.167 --> 00:56:12.902
THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS OTHER

00:56:12.969 --> 00:56:14.437
THAN TO ULTIMATELY THAT

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:15.638
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE ON.

00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:17.607
THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE HOUSING

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:20.343
AND SUPPORTS FOR INDIVIDUALS.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.346
WHO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:24.848
THAT'S ALL THINGS THAT WE ARE

00:56:24.914 --> 00:56:26.516
WORKING ON AS AN ADMINISTRATION

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:27.917
CURRENTLY AND LOTS OF

00:56:27.984 --> 00:56:29.552
INVESTMENTS IN ALL OF THE AND

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:31.121
THOSE AREAS THAT WILL HELP

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:34.858
ULTIMATELY- HELP ADDRESS THIS AT

00:56:34.924 --> 00:56:36.493
ON GOING INCREASE AND HOPEFULLY

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:38.561
VERY QUICKLY. ONCE INVESTMENTS

00:56:38.628 --> 00:56:39.796
ARE START TO MEET AND BE

00:56:39.863 --> 00:56:41.765
IMPLEMENTED TO HELP REDUCE THAT

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:43.333
TREND OKAY SO I GUESS WHAT I

00:56:43.399 --> 00:56:50.373
WOULD. SAY IS THAT- LIES IT'S

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.574
NOT NECESSARY TO HAND. BUT NO

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:52.742
LESS WE INDEMNIFY. SOME OF THESE

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:55.145
CAUSE IT'S BE AN EXTRA IN FOR.

00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:55.779
RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT- THE

00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:57.046
COW YOU CAN PLAY A ROLE IN TERMS

00:56:57.113 --> 00:56:58.748
OF YOU KNOW EITHER PROVIDING OR

00:56:58.815 --> 00:56:59.916
NOT PROVIDING SERVICES WHICH

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:01.317
THEN WOULD COMPEL A JUDGE TO

00:57:01.384 --> 00:57:02.685
FEEL LIKE WHAT I DO NEED TO

00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:04.187
REFER NOTS AYE ANDERSON OLY

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:05.155
UNDERSTAND YOU EXPLAIN THAT

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:07.090
DYNAMIC. AT THE SAME TIME IF WE

00:57:07.157 --> 00:57:08.892
CAN IDENTIFY WHY THE NUMBER OF

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:10.960
CASES INCREASES THIS POINTED OUT

00:57:11.027 --> 00:57:12.262
IN THAT ANALYSIS FAILED TO THAT

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:13.930
THE BACKLOG HAS INCREASED FROM A

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:17.333
COUPLE HUNDRED TO NOW THOUSAND

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.334
SEVEN HUNDRED. BUT WE UNDERSTAND

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:20.837
WHAT'S DRIVING THAT. THE AND ALL

00:57:20.904 --> 00:57:21.971
ARE AND THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO

00:57:22.038 --> 00:57:23.373
UNDERSTAND WHETHER INTERVENTIONS

00:57:23.439 --> 00:57:26.309
ARE WORKING OR NOT RIGHT- YOU

00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:28.511
KNOW MAYBE ON THE GROUND LEVEL

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:30.446
WORLD BOWL. HOPEFULLY THE

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:31.648
NUMBERS TO GO DOWN BUT THEY'RE

00:57:31.714 --> 00:57:32.849
NOT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

00:57:32.916 --> 00:57:34.384
TEASE OUT WHAT WHICH ONES ARE

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:35.451
WORKING WHICH ONES ARE. ARE NOT

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:36.886
AND IN FACT WE TOUCHED ON THE

00:57:36.953 --> 00:57:37.687
FACT THAT YOU HAVE THESE

00:57:37.754 --> 00:57:38.755
RECOMMENDATIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED

00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:40.890
SOME OF THEM WHEN I AND SO MANY

00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:41.825
OTHERS TO MAYBE DISAGREE ABOUT

00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:43.593
SOME. BUT IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.128
DATA DRIVEN EFFORT AND WE'RE

00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:46.262
INVESTING A LOT OF MONEY IN

00:57:46.329 --> 00:57:49.098
THIS- RIGHT- I THINK FIGHT OVER

00:57:49.165 --> 00:57:52.368
FIVE HUNDRED. MILLION. CORRECT

00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:54.838
SO THAT'S- IN A IN. THE I THINK

00:57:54.904 --> 00:57:56.739
WE NEED TO ALSO FIRST. HOW DO WE

00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:58.107
PUT THINGS IN PLACE THAT WE CAN

00:57:58.174 --> 00:57:59.776
ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT LIKE OKAY

00:57:59.843 --> 00:58:01.544
WHAT'S DRIVING THIS RIGHT NOW IS

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:02.812
BECAUSE OF THE JUDGES CONTINUE

00:58:02.879 --> 00:58:04.781
THE INCREASE THAT ARE. AFRAID OF

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:06.683
REFERRALS FOR ICE TEA. WE MAY

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:07.984
NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THAT

00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:09.619
RIGHT AND SO WHY ARE THEY DOING

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:10.753
THAT AND IF IT IS BECAUSE THE

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:11.921
COUNTIES ARE DELIVERING ENOUGH

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:12.555
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE

00:58:12.622 --> 00:58:14.224
COUNTY THEN. WE CAN POINT OUT

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.525
THE ROOT CAUSE AND THAT'S WHERE

00:58:15.592 --> 00:58:16.926
YOU DIRECT THE MONEY IN THE

00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:17.994
EFFORTS. BUT LOOK AT IT OR IF

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:19.629
IT'S NOT ENOUGH HOUSING RIGHT

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:20.430
BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU'RE HOMELESS

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:21.865
IT'S SO FORTH. SO AND I KNOW

00:58:21.931 --> 00:58:24.033
YOU'RE SORT OF. TOUCHING ON THE

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.302
THESE THINGS- BUT- SO I GUESS

00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:28.838
MY- AND NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION

00:58:28.905 --> 00:58:29.806
FOR ELLIE- BUT ONE OF THINGS

00:58:29.873 --> 00:58:33.610
THAT- MORE OF A COMMENT. SO AS

00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:34.544
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS WHAT'S-

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:35.845
AT LEAST FOR ME. THE HELP. IS

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:37.447
ACTUALLY DOING A DIAGRAM OF THE

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:38.882
SYSTEM RIGHT THIS IS THE INPUT

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:39.916
RIGHT SO WE HAVE PEOPLE MENTAL

00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:41.251
HEALTH ISSUES SOME OF THEM END

00:58:41.317 --> 00:58:43.553
UP UNFORTUNATELY IN DOWN. IN THE

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:44.654
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM RIGHT

00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:45.955
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HOPEFULLY

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:46.723
WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:48.191
THAT. SOME OF THEM WON'T MAKE IT

00:58:48.258 --> 00:58:48.992
THERE RIGHT SO THAT'S AN EXIT

00:58:49.058 --> 00:58:50.960
POINT. NOW YOUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:52.528
SYSTEM. YOU KNOW THE COURT. YOU

00:58:52.595 --> 00:58:53.997
KNOW ANOTHER EXIT POINT YOU KNOW

00:58:54.063 --> 00:58:55.131
COMMUNITY SERVICES VERSUS THE

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:56.733
HOSPITAL AND SO FORTH AND HOW

00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:58.668
MANY PEOPLE ARE. EXITING AND

00:58:58.735 --> 00:58:59.435
ENTERING AT THESE DIFFERENT

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:01.404
POINTS. RIGHT AND THEN SO AT

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:03.273
LEAST WE CAN MONITOR. THE FIGURE

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:04.407
OUT OKAY WE'RE DOING THESE

00:59:04.474 --> 00:59:05.842
INTERVENTIONS ARE WE SEEING A

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:07.477
CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:59:07.543 --> 00:59:08.912
EITHER ON RAMPING- OFF RAMPING

00:59:08.978 --> 00:59:11.080
THIS PATHWAY THAT LEADS TO. YOU

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:12.715
KNOW ESSENTIALLY DYNASTY PROGRAM

00:59:12.782 --> 00:59:14.817
AND EITHER STATE HOSPITALIZATION

00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:17.086
OR COMMITTEE SERVICES- SO. I

00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:19.455
THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. TO

00:59:19.522 --> 00:59:20.890
AND THEN SAY OKAY AND HOW IS

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:22.325
THAT CHANGING OVER TIME AS WE'RE

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:23.626
IMPLEMENTING THIS AS WE'RE

00:59:23.693 --> 00:59:24.794
INVESTING OUR FIVE HUNDRED

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:25.929
MILLION ANNUALLY. HOW IS THAT

00:59:25.995 --> 00:59:27.563
CHANGING IS A CHANGING AT ALL IS

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.432
IT HOW THE CHANGING AND- AND

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:30.667
TRYING TO SEE WERE CONCERNED

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:32.468
THAT IF I SOME OF THE RECENT

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:33.136
ROOT CAUSES BECAUSE IT SAID WE-

00:59:33.202 --> 00:59:35.038
YOU KNOW WE INVESTED. PROBABLY

00:59:35.104 --> 00:59:35.571
NOT ENOUGH BACK IN TWENTY

00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:37.540
EIGHTEEN. LOOKS LIKE IT MADE

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:39.175
LITTLE DENT HERE. BUT IF WE

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.109
CAN'T QUANTIFY SOME OF THESE

00:59:40.176 --> 00:59:41.878
THINGS WERE NOT GOING TO KNOW

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:42.712
FOR YEARS I MEAN I WILL BE IN

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:44.647
OFFICE BUT- MAY CENTER EGGMAN.

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:46.015
AND SHE'S KIND OF THE SEATS

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:48.318
OPENED UP HER TIME HERE- WITH

00:59:48.384 --> 00:59:53.456
THAT WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT.

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:55.024
WILL ACTUALLY. WE SOLVE THE

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:55.825
PROBLEM OF HAVEN'T SAW. AT LEAST

00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:56.759
WE IDENTIFIED. HOW TO SOLVE THE-

00:59:56.826 --> 00:59:58.962
BY THE END. AND I SERVE. LIKE

00:59:59.028 --> 00:59:59.729
YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A TO BE NO

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:00.897
FOR. COMPONENT SO WE KNOW WELL

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:02.365
WHAT'S MAKING DIFFERENCE. AND

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:03.633
THEN FINALLY I GUESS I WOULD

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.600
JUST ALSO SAY AS I APPRECIATE

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:05.902
THAT. SOME OF THE

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:07.136
RECOMMENDATIONS OF COURSE DON'T

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:08.771
DIRECTLY INVOLVE THIS DEPARTMENT

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.373
BUT I THINK OF THE HELPFUL.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.642
OTHERS FINANCES JOBBER ARTSY

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:13.476
HOUSE WILL HELP US WITH THIS.

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:15.078
AND IF I WHICH OTHER AGENCIES

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:16.312
ARE THE ONES BECAUSE THOSE WERE

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:18.147
OVERSEEING THE OTHER. AGENCIES

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:19.749
AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WE

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:20.950
WANT TO BE SURE LOOKING BACK TO

SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ARE YOU

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:26.889
GOING TO BE D. TAKING YOUR OF

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.224
THIS PART OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.727
THAT STEP INTO PER YOUR AGENCY-

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:32.662
SO. WITH THAT I AGAIN APPRECIATE

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:37.066

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:38.001
FOR TO THE PANEL THANK YOU.

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:40.703
THANK YOU. MUCH- AT AND I THINK

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:42.739
THE POINT DR PANDA'S MAKING OKAY

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:44.774
AS IN THE YOU ARE THE MOST

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:47.176
EXPENSIVE STOP- ON ON THE ON THE

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:49.979
PATH OF CARE. AND I WOULD GUESS

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:51.347
ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO

01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:53.383
LIMIT THE AMOUNT UP COUNTY CAN

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.985
REFER. IS THAT IT WOULD

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:57.320
ENCOURAGE THEM PEARL TO PROVIDE

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:58.988
MORE RELENTLESS ENGAGEMENT

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:01.057
THAT'S ONE THAT I MEAN TWENTY

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:01.724
HUGE ISSUES A LOT OF THESE FOLKS

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:03.793
ARE VERY HARD TO ENGAGE. AND IT

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:04.861
TAKES RELENTLESS ENGAGEMENT

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:07.363
WHICH TO HOPEFULLY WE ARE. WE

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.931
ARE. PUTTING A LOT OF MONEYINTO

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.900
THE PIPELINE TO KEEP FOLKS FROM

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:13.536
GETTING TO YOUR POINT. BUT I

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:17.573
GUESS I WOULD I WOULD ASK- ED.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.475
MISTER SHEET WHEN YOU DO DO THIS

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:22.545
ANALYSIS IF WE IF THE UPSTREAM

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:23.513
AND DOWNSTREAM THAT DOCTOR PAN

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:24.714
IS TALKING ABOUT I DON'T KNOW

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:26.582
PERHAPS H. CHI WOULD BE THE

01:01:26.649 --> 01:01:28.384
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR LOOKING

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:30.053
AT SOME OF THAT DATA. VERSUS

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:31.554
PUTTING IT YOU KNOW ALL IN THE

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:32.722
STATE HOSPITAL WHEN THEY ARE

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:34.791
THERE THE BLAST OBVERSES THE END

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:37.427
POINT I THINK IT WOULD TAKE NEED

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:38.861
MORE. MORE PEOPLE IDENTIFYING ON

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:40.563
THE ENDPOINT HOW DO WE PREVENT

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:43.433
PEOPLE FROM GETTING TO THE STATE

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:44.967
HOSPITALS. AND I DON'T KNOW. AND

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:46.235
I'M JUST THINKING MAYBE IT CUT

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:48.271
AS THEIR NEW. ROLE WILL HAVE

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:50.773
ACCESS TO THE DATA FROM ALL OVER

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.544
DH YES I'M- SO. ANYWAY JUST. I

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:55.912
THINK IT DEPENDS VERY ACCURATE

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:57.647
THAT WE NEED TO IDENTIFY. HOW

01:01:57.713 --> 01:01:59.182
IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING AND SINCE

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:01.050
IT'S SUCH A BIG COMPLEX SYSTEM.

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:03.119
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ONE

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:05.054
COMPONENT OF THAT SYSTEM. TO DO

01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:08.825
THE EVALUATION OF ALL OF IT SO-

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:11.761
SO I GUESS WITH THAT THEN. WE

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:13.429
WILL GET TO OUR PANEL AND- JUST

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:14.764
FOR THE PUBLIC OUR PANEL WAS

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:16.666
COMPRISED. AND THE STAFF WERE

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:19.302
ASKED. EACH PERSON TO GO TO

ANSWER A SERIES OF QUESTIONS AS

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:22.438
WE DO FOR ALL OF OUR FOLKS TO

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.474
HELP GUIDE OUR CONVERSATIONS. SO

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.409
FAR THE PANEL AGAIN ARE GOING TO

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:28.144

AUTISTIC. HE HAS SCHIZO

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:07.695
AFFECTIVE DISORDER. FROM THE

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.697
TIME THAT HE WAS A YOUNG BOY HE

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:11.866
WAS PLACED IN AND OUT OF MENTAL

01:31:11.933 --> 01:31:14.936
HOSPITALS HE ALSO SUFFERED

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:19.207
SEVERE PHYSICAL ABUSE. AT HOME

01:31:19.273 --> 01:31:24.612
AND AT SCHOOL. MIKE IS NOT. HE

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:26.747
DOES HAVE MELTDOWNS BECAUSE OF

01:31:26.814 --> 01:31:29.150
THE AUTISM. HE DOES STRUGGLE

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:32.486
WITH HEARING VOICES IN HIS HEAD

01:31:32.553 --> 01:31:34.255
. BUT WHEN HE HAS A GOOD SUPPORT

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.924
STRUCTURE AND YOU READ IRAQ JIM.

01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:38.960
YOU CAN GET THROUGH THOSE

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:42.396
MELTDOWNS. JOHN SMALL WAS HIS

01:31:42.463 --> 01:31:44.999
ROCK AND HE WAS VERY PROTECTIVE

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:47.235
OF HER. SHE PASSED AWAY ONE

01:31:47.301 --> 01:31:55.776
MONTH. AFTER JOHN GOT ARRESTED.

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:58.079
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND

01:31:58.145 --> 01:32:01.148
THAT HIS MOM IS GONE HE THINKS

01:32:01.215 --> 01:32:02.250
THAT WHEN HE COMES BACK OVER

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:10.191
HERE THAT. SHOWING ERROR. I'M

01:32:10.258 --> 01:32:13.961
SORRY. BUT WHEN JOHN WAS TAKEN

01:32:14.028 --> 01:32:17.765
INTO CUSTODY HE LOST HIS HOUSING

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:18.332
I HAVE FOUND IN AFFORDABLE

01:32:18.399 --> 01:32:20.902
HOUSING HE'S LOST HIS SOCIAL

01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:23.437
SECURITY BENEFITS HE LOST HIS

01:32:23.504 --> 01:32:26.374
PERSONAL POSSESSIONS BECAUSE WE

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.142
HAD TO VACATE THE APARTMENT I

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:30.011
BELIEVE THAT MY COUSIN HAD BEEN

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:31.512
PLACED IN A COMMUNITY TREATMENT

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:33.948
PROGRAM HE WOULD HAVE RESPONDED

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:36.584
TO TREATMENT ONCE AGAIN HE'S

01:32:36.651 --> 01:32:38.085
NEVER BEEN VIOLENT HE'S NEVER

01:32:38.152 --> 01:32:43.291
HIT ANYBODY HE JUST USES WORDS

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:43.891
HEARING HAS NOT FOUND. AT THE

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:46.260
TIME THAT HE WAS TAKEN INTO

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:49.430
CUSTODY. I TRIED SO HARD TO FIND

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:53.000
PSYCHIATRIST. SOCIAL WORKERS

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:55.403
CASE MANAGEMENT FOR HIM BUT

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:57.438
BECAUSE THE CULPRIT I THINK THE

01:32:57.505 --> 01:32:59.907
SERVICES ONE LIKE WHAT EXISTED

01:32:59.974 --> 01:33:02.610
SO AT THE LAST MINUTE THE

01:33:02.677 --> 01:33:05.646
APPOINTMENTS WOULD BE CANCELED.

01:33:05.713 --> 01:33:08.082
NOW WHILE HE'S IN CUSTODY HE

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:11.085
DOES SEE A PSYCHIATRIST I

01:33:11.152 --> 01:33:14.655
BELIEVE OVER. THE TELEVISION AND

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:18.125
HE SEES THIS DOCTOR EVERY THREE

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:19.827
MONTHS FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:22.797
AND THEN ON OCCASION A SOCIAL

01:33:22.863 --> 01:33:24.265
WORKER MAY COME TO VISIT. I'D

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:26.400
LIKE TO SEE MY COUSIN COME HOME

01:33:26.467 --> 01:33:28.469
AND RECLAIM HIS LIFE. I BELIEVE

01:33:28.536 --> 01:33:29.770
THAT HE WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE

01:33:29.837 --> 01:33:32.139
MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAM

01:33:32.206 --> 01:33:33.841
THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO GET

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:36.243
CLOSE TO HOME AND HE'S WELCOME

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:37.979
IN MY HOME. AND IT WOULD AVOID

01:33:38.045 --> 01:33:41.349
CONVICTION. ON HIS RECORD. IT

01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:43.784
WOULD ALLOW HIM TO BE ABLE TO

01:33:43.851 --> 01:33:45.820
SIX CARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ONCE

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:48.055

01:33:56.931 --> 01:33:58.966

01:48:20.627 --> 01:48:21.595
MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY SERVE

01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:23.563
THROUGH CAL AIM THAT WOULD ALSO

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:25.165
THAT IDEALLY HELP DIVERT THEM

01:48:25.232 --> 01:48:26.399
FROM EVER HITTING THE COLONEL

01:48:26.466 --> 01:48:29.836
JUSTICE SYSTEM SO. I'M TRYING TO

01:48:29.903 --> 01:48:30.937
FIGURE OUT HOW TO QUANTIFY THAT.

01:48:31.004 --> 01:48:32.873

PROGRAM THAT STARTING FROM AT

01:49:26.026 --> 01:49:27.494

FARTHER UPSTREAM- BUT I'M JUST

01:50:52.779 --> 01:50:54.280
TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT IS

HEAD BECAUSE OF ONE WE'RE

01:52:10.623 --> 01:52:11.858
THINKING ABOUT. THESE FOLKS HOW

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:13.626

MY HEAD AND WE DO HAVE OUR

02:35:38.729 --> 02:35:40.197
ACTING CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER

02:35:40.264 --> 02:35:42.099

MISTER GORE THAT THERE'S

02:35:47.337 --> 02:35:48.706
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED TWENTY

02:35:48.772 --> 02:35:50.708
ACRES AT NAPA TWO HUNDRED TWENTY

02:35:50.774 --> 02:35:52.109
ACRES IN NAPA AND HOW MUCH-

02:35:52.176 --> 02:35:54.945
GROUND IS THE HOSPITAL TAKE UP

02:35:55.012 --> 02:35:59.349
IN PARKING. I'M NOT SURE WE KNOW

02:35:59.416 --> 02:36:00.984
THAT NOT INSURANCE SO I THINK WE

02:36:01.051 --> 02:36:02.753
MAY BE ABLE TO TAKE A- LOOK AT

02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:04.955
HOW MANY ACREAGES UTILIZED FOR A

02:36:05.022 --> 02:36:06.557
HOSPITAL SPECIFIC OPERATIONS AND

02:36:06.623 --> 02:36:09.126
WHAT. MAY NOT BE MAXIMIZED IN

02:36:09.193 --> 02:36:10.294
AND CAN REPORT BACK TO YOUR

02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:11.962
STAFF ON THAT. THAT WOULD BE

02:36:12.029 --> 02:36:13.430
GREAT AND THEN MAYBE DO FOR THE

02:36:13.497 --> 02:36:15.432
REST OF THE HOSPITALS TO I MEAN.

02:36:15.499 --> 02:36:17.301
AS WE LOOK AT X. AS WE LOOK AT

02:36:17.367 --> 02:36:18.635
THE- NEED FOR HOUSING AS WE LOOK

02:36:18.702 --> 02:36:21.371
AT THE NEED FOR A LAND FOR

02:36:21.438 --> 02:36:22.439
HOUSING. IT IT'S JUST

02:36:22.506 --> 02:36:23.807
INTERESTING TO THINK OF SOME OF

02:36:23.874 --> 02:36:25.075
OUR STATE HOSPITALS OR A BIG

02:36:25.142 --> 02:36:26.410
PIECES OF LAND AND WE'RE NOT

02:36:26.477 --> 02:36:28.145
USING ALL OF THAT. PERHAPS I

02:36:28.212 --> 02:36:29.780
COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

02:36:29.847 --> 02:36:34.318
CONSIDER. BUT PRINT. I WOULD TO

02:36:34.384 --> 02:36:36.487
TOSSES. IS THAT- AND THIS IS

02:36:36.553 --> 02:36:37.354
INTERESTING BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:36:37.421 --> 02:36:38.822
SEVERAL ITEMS I CALL THIS THE

02:36:38.889 --> 02:36:40.023
LANDLORD PART. OF THE- IN THE

02:36:40.090 --> 02:36:41.692
HEARING- AND I KNOW THAT THE

02:36:41.759 --> 02:36:43.293
VARSITY HOSPITALS AND- CERTAINLY

02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:45.896
AS OVERSEE ELASTICITIES AND

02:36:45.963 --> 02:36:47.898
PROPERTY. IF THIS ISN'T

02:36:47.965 --> 02:36:48.699
NECESSARY FOR THE FUNCTION THE

02:36:48.766 --> 02:36:49.600
HOSPITAL MORE WHETHER IT'S

02:36:49.666 --> 02:36:51.335
SELLING IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES

02:36:51.401 --> 02:36:52.903
ALL OR IS THERE ANOTHER AGENCY

02:36:52.970 --> 02:36:54.805
IN THE STATE. THAT MIGHT HAVE

02:36:54.872 --> 02:36:58.442
THE EXPERTISE. SO SIGNALED THE-

02:36:58.509 --> 02:36:59.943
TO RETURN OPERATE THAT PROPERTY

02:37:00.010 --> 02:37:01.311
IF FOR SOME REASON THE STATE

02:37:01.378 --> 02:37:03.113
WHAT'S THE CONTINUE POSSESSION-

02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:04.448
CERTAINLY AGAIN THE PARTY

02:37:04.515 --> 02:37:05.816
HOSPITALS A LOT OF EXPERTISE BUT

02:37:05.883 --> 02:37:06.884
I THINK WE WANT TO KEEP YOU

02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:08.619
FOCUSED ON THE CARE OF PATIENTS

02:37:08.685 --> 02:37:09.386
AND THEN OF COURSE THE

02:37:09.453 --> 02:37:11.255
FACILITIES THAT THEY RESIDE IN.

02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:12.389
BUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOW

02:37:12.456 --> 02:37:15.692
HAVING TO GET ENGINEERS TO

02:37:15.759 --> 02:37:17.427
SENSUALLY OPERATE RESERVOIRS-

02:37:17.494 --> 02:37:19.463
HERE WHAT THEIR DAD IS BETTER

02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:21.298
PLACED IN AN AGENCY THAT'S USED

02:37:21.365 --> 02:37:23.100
TO. HANDLING WATER NOT THAT YOU

02:37:23.167 --> 02:37:24.668
CAN'T DO IT BUT I THINK THERE'S

02:37:24.735 --> 02:37:26.470
CERTAIN YOU KNOW CERTAIN

02:37:26.537 --> 02:37:27.004
EXPERTISE. MAYBE AND OTHER

02:37:27.070 --> 02:37:28.372
AGENCIES THAT MAY BE MORE

02:37:28.438 --> 02:37:30.541
RELEVANCE- THAT AND TO MAKE IT

02:37:30.607 --> 02:37:32.609
MORE EFFICIENT TO DO IT THAT

02:37:32.676 --> 02:37:34.378
WAY. THANK YOU. IF YOU THINK

02:37:34.444 --> 02:37:35.546
SOMETHING IS MORE COMPLICATED

02:37:35.612 --> 02:37:37.948
THAN- OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

02:37:38.015 --> 02:37:40.317

YOU WANT TO MIX THOSE TWO TOO

02:37:42.619 --> 02:37:44.254
MUCH LONGER IF YOU CAN IF YOU

02:37:44.321 --> 02:37:45.789
CAN NOT. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON. TO
