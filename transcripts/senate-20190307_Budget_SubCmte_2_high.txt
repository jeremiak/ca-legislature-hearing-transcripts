WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES AS PROVIDE SORT OF A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW? OF OF THE APPROACH THAT I'M BRINGING -- TO LEADING THEAGENCY -- AND AS IT RELATES TO THIS BUDGET IF I COULD -- YOU KNOW FOR MY PERSPECTIVE THE NOT TO RESOURCE AGENCY IN THE STATE FACES A NUMBER OF GROWING CHALLENGES -- DROUGHT FLOODS WILDFIRE ARE WORSENING ARE DRIVEN IN PART BY CLIMATE CHANGE -- SEA LEVEL RISE IS IMPACTING COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND THREATENING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE -- ECONOMIC AND POPULATION GROWTH -- WHICH OF COURSE WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE OUR PUT NEW DEMANDS ON OUR NATURAL RESOURCES SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT. IN TIME. FOR THE NATURIST OR HIS AGENCY AT THE SAME TIME WE THINK THE OPORTUNITIES ARE GREAT ACTUALLY JUST A CHALLENGES -- WE HAVE NEW RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THE VOTERS MOST RECENTLY PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT PASSED IN JUNE WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT TODAY. WE HAVE LEADERSHIP FROM THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE ON CRITICAL ISSUES -- LIKE OUT WILD FIRE SAFETY WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO MANY OTHER ISSUES [inaudible] I'M. WE HAVE A POPULOUS ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS THE NEED TO BALANCE OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PRESERVATION OF PROTECTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. I AND THEN WE HAVE A TALENTED WORKFORCE THE NATIONAL RESOURCES AGENCY I THE EASIEST JOB HERE TODAY I COULD TAKE IT TO STAND UP OR SIT UP HERE AND AND GIVE A HIGH LEVEL VISION BUT THAT WOMEN AND MEN BEHIND ME ARE THE ONES THAT PUT TOGETHER THE BUDGET. AND SO WE HAVE I JUST A A WHOLE SET OF TALENTED LEADERS THE NATURIST ARSES AGENCY. SO. WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS JUST HIGHLIGHTED THOUGHT AT HIGHEST LEVEL THE THE APPROACH IN THE PRIORITIES THAT I RING TO THE NATURIST ARSES AGENCY -- SO FIRST OF ALL A NEW ISSUE NEAR AND DEAR TO YOUR HEART SHERMAN. IS OUR OUR EFFORT OUR COMMITMENT TO A REALLY ALIGNED THIS ELEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET OF THE AGENCY TO BUILD. OUR RESILIENCE NOT TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE STATE FROM THESE THREATS. ARE WILD FIRE DROUGHT FLOOD ETCETERA -- IN SPECIFICALLY I IN THE IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM AS IT RELATES TO WILD FIRE PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AGAINST WILDFIRE RISKS -- AND THREATS AS EARLY AS THIS SUMMER. NOW YOU YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT CAL FIRE -- PUBLICLY RELEASED ITS SO CALLED FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT I'M IN RESPONSE THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. GOVERNOR NEW SOME ISSUE THAT EXECUTIVE ORDERS FIRST DAY IN OFFICE -- I'D DIRECTING CAL FIRE TO IDENTIFY RECOMMENDED ACTIONS TO PROTECT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AS EARLY -- IMMEDIATELY FOR THE COMING FIRE SEASON. CALIFORNIA -- WORK WITH OTHER AGENCIES TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY TO PRIORITIZE THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. BY PHYSICAL WILD FIRE RISK BUT USE LIKE TRANSPORTATION INGRESS AND EGRESS I AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS LIKE AGE. OUR CAR OWNERSHIP BASICALLY MOBILITY. ARE AND SO WE'RE FOCUSED -- IN COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS ARE ON THE OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS AND WORK TO PROTECT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES -- UNDERSTANDING OF COURSE THE DEVASTATION AND TRAGEDY OF THE CAMPFIRE AND THE IMPACT ON THE TOWN OF PARADISE. SHIFTING GEARS A BUT STILL HONOR THAT FRAME OF RESILIENCE IS MODERNIZING OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. I AND WATER MANAGEMENT I TO ADDRESS MORE VARIABLE HYDROLOGY ARE DRIES WILL BECOME DRIER ARE WET PERIODS WILL BECOME WETTER. AND TO TO MEET THE NEEDS OF AGAIN A GROWING STATE. AND THE NEED TO ENSURE ENOUGH WATER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT SO WILD FIRE AND WATER KEY -- FOUNDATIONS OF OUR WORK ON ON RESILIENCE. ANOTHER BIG PRIORITY FOR ME AND I THINK THE AGENCY IS STRENGTHENING THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE NATURAL RESOURCES -- SO GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS EXPANDING ACCESS TO OUR PARKS -- FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY THOSE IN IN. COMMUNITIES ARE WITHOUT ARE SIGNIFICANT ACCESS TO PARKS -- AND THEN LASTLY IS JUST RECRUITING AND AND MAINTAINING A TALENTED WORKFORCE AT THE RESOURCES AGENCY. ARE YOU KNOW WE VERY MUCH OF YOURSELVES IMPLEMENTERS OF THE LEGISLATURE'S OUR DIRECTOR OF POLICY DIRECTION OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR'S AS WELL. AND SO OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT IS ONLY AS OF OUR STAFF I AND SO THAT'S A THAT'S AN AREA OF KEY PRIORITY FOR ME. WHAT YOU HEAR ABOUT TODAY IS A PROPOSED BUDGET -- THAT PRIORITIZES. THOSE PRINCIPLES THAT I JUST ARTICULATED. I DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PROPOSED OFF FOUR HUNDRED PLUS MILLION DOLLARS OF NEW FUNDING -- TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRE AND MANAGE FORESTS. AND THEN I'M ALSO A PARTICULARLY EXCITED WITH OUR BUDGET INVESTMENTS IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS. WHICH IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAM ON MANY LEVELS -- pTHE CORE MEMBERS MANY OF WHOM WERE ACTUALLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO YESTERDAY ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING -- CRITICAL **** CONTRIBUTION TO THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ON WILDFIRE AND AND MOST RECENTLY I THIS WEEK UP IN GLENN COUNTY WITH FLOODING. SO LOOKING FORWARD TO I AGAIN YOUR OVERSIGHT OF OUR BUDGET AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR THAT THE OTHER IS A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION BETWEEN -- BEING FISCALLY PRUDENT BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE THE PREVIOUS GOVERNORS HIS POUND THE DEAD IN TESTS AND THEN BEING. AMBITIOUS FOR THE CLIMATE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE HAPPEN HI YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT IT. EVEN THE LA -- SUGGEST THAT WE LEAVE SOME MONEY THIS FOR SO THAT WE DON'T. FOR IN THE OUT YEARS BUT THERE'S A TENSION THAT SAYS WELL IF WE START DOING HEALTHY SOILS SERVERS. WERE SEQUESTRATION OR OTHER OTHER CHANGES IMMEDIATELY WE MAY NOT ONLY -- REAP THE BENEFITS OF REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES AND START TURNING BENDING ARE -- EMISSIONS BUT ALSO REPAIR THE FOREST IN AND AND HAVE THAT DO YOU CAN YOU. WAX ELOQUENTLY ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE HERE FOR WHAT AWAK WAX CAREFULLY ABOUT THAT. AND JUST SAY YOU KNOW MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU KNOW PROJECTING THOSE REVENUES FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IS A COMPLEX EXERCISE. I IN A LOW AND DIFFERENT EXPERTS HAVE DIFFERENT PROJECTIONS -- SO THERE'S OBVIOUSLY AS YOU SAY SOME SORT OF TENSION OR SOMETIME DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AROUND -- YOU KNOW WHAT REVENUES WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE -- MY GOAL IS NOT TO NOT TO ENGAGE IN THAT COMPLEX PROCESS BECAUSE FRANKLY -- IT'S NOT AN EXPERTISE THAT I HAVE BUT TO ENSURE THAT THE RESOURCES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE GOVERNOR WHILE UTILIZED -- SO I AM. LOOKING FORWARD TO ENSURING THAT THE RE OR COOLEY GO TOWARD STRENGTHENING OUR RESILIENCE. YEAH BECAUSE WE'VE WE'VE SPEND SOMETIME IN THIS CASE -- SUBCOMMITTEE ON TRYING TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK YEAH AND AND WE REALIZE THAT WE HAVE MEMBERS REQUEST ON ON THAT -- DIFFERENT CATEGORIES WE UNDERSTAND ON PROP SIXTY EIGHT THAT THE BOND REQUIRES US TO DO YOU KNOW IS THERE CERTAIN CATEGORIES THAT WERE SPENDING BUT WITHIN THOSE SUBCATEGORIES -- HOW? HOW CAN WE TIME TO SPENDING BECAUSE WE WHEN WE'RE UNDER NO? LIMITATIONS ON HOW MUCH MONEY WE SPEND THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR BUT DID YOU WOULD IN CATEGORIES THAT WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET THOSE LONG TERMS AND AN IMMEDIATE OF A FAX -- QUESTIONS OF THE SECRETARY. FIVE CENTER MONEY GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WELCOME MR SECRETARY -- JUST FOR PRESS SPOTLIGHT ON YEAR HIGHLIGHTING OF SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS -- THAT PROGRAM PROVED INSTRUMENTAL WHEN WE SUFFERED. FLOOD DAMAGE LOSS OF A BRIDGE IN THE BIG SUR AREA COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE FIVE FOR BRIDGE. IN THE IN RECORD TIME HELPED CONSTRUCT WITH THE SUPPORT OF PARKS -- AN EMERGENCY. A TRAIL FOR RESIDENTS AND WORK FORCE IN THAT AREA. BUT MY QUESTION GOES. TO WITH OUR EXTENDED FIRE SEASON REALLY VIRTUALLY ALMOST YEAR ROUND FIRE SEASON. CAL FIRE PLANNING IS THERE ANY PIPELINE THAT HELPS MOVE. YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HAVE. WORKED THROUGH CONSERVATION CORPS. TO BE CONSIDERED FOR JOBS WITHIN CAL FIRE. IN WHILE EXPANDING BUDGETS FOR CALIFORNIA -- FOR YEAR ROUND READING THIS -- OPEN THE DOOR FOR SOME A PATHWAY FOR SOME OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE IF YOU KNOW AND MAY BE BETTER DIRECTED -- TO TO SEE SEE SEE BENT IF YOU KNOW YEAH IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I WOULD DEFER. TO THE CORE REPRESENTATIVES HERE TODAY TO EXPLAIN IT IN DETAIL BUT I THINK WE HAVE -- TO WE HAVE TO DEVELOP THAT CONNECTION AND THAT NEXUS -- IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE WE NEED TO BUILD A PIPELINE OF FIREFIGHTERS -- YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN RANKS AND IT ONLY MAKES SENSE I MEAN THESE CORE MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY. GAINING EXPERIENCE AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- ESSENTIALLY WILD FIRE SAFETY PROJECTS SO -- I'LL BE INTERESTED IN IN ADD THEIR RESPONSE TODAY. THANK YOU IN I SHOULD'VE LED BY TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. FORGET TO OTHER MEMBERS I DID FORGET YOU KNOW ONE OF THE A CONTINUING THEMES THAT WE HAVE WITH THE RESOURCE AGENCIES THAT WE'VE WE'VE. FOCUSED SO MUCH AND WE'VE STRUCTURED YEAR ELEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET A SPECIAL FUNDS YOU KNOW WILL END AND WE REALIZE WILL HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM. OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THAT WE ARE NEVER GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THAT THE SERVICES THAT WE EXPECT THEM WANTING YOUR PRONGS IS BRINGING PEOPLE INTO THE PARKS IN INTO THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT SAID THE THE ENJOY IT. PUTTING ASIDE ALL THE FIRE HARDENING AND ALL THAT WORK HAS BEEN DONE WE HAD WE COULD SPEND ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS JUST ON THE REPAIRS OF THE TH OF THE EXISTING. PARK FOOTPRINTS THAT WE HAVE -- IN THIS SAID MINUSCULE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUNDS SUGGESTED IN THIS BUDGET CAN YOU. GIVE US SOME IDEA OF YOUR PHILOSOPHY -- HOW WE YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE CAN ASK WE COULD WE'VE ALREADY TRIED? INCREASING THE COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN'S OFFICIAL PERSONS LICENSE BY 2000% THAT DIDN'T THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A POSSIBILITY BUT WE WE CANNOT THINK OF ALL T. -- THE SERVICES THAT ARE IN THESE AREAS SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T PAY FOR THE WELL THE NEED THAT THEY HAVE YEAH. I MEAN THE NOW TO RESOURCES AGENCY STEWARDS IT'S FOR THE STATE SO YOU THINK ABOUT THE STATE PARKS IN YOUR DISTRICTS -- AND REALLY ANY MANNER OF OF LAND OR PROPERTY OR FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE FRANKLY IS I ENSURING THAT WE HAVE FUNDS TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THOSE ASSETS. OUR STATE VOTERS HAVE BEEN VERY GENEROUS IN APPROVING GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS -- AGAIN MOST RECENTLY LAST JUNE PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT AND AND THOSE BOND PROVIDE CRITICAL CAPITAL FUNDING BY THE CAPITAL FUNDING IS ONE TIME IN NATURE -- INTO ONE AREA OF FOCUS A PRIORITY WE HAVE IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE CAN OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THOSE -- THOSE FACILITIES THAT WERE INVESTING IN -- SO I THINK IT'S A CHALLENGE MOVING FORWARD AND ONE THAT WE WANT WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ON A ALSO MENTION ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF OUR BUDGET AND IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS IS. CURRENTLY I THINK THIS YEAR ARE WE ARE WE WLL BE SPENDING OVER A BILLION DOLLARS -- ON THE INTERESTS PAYING BACK THE INTEREST OF THOSE BONDS THAT SERVICE -- AND SO -- WHILE BONDS HELP FOR THE NATURIST ARSES AGENCY -- FIGURING OUT A SUSTAIN SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL. IT JUST SEEMS THAT YOU KNOW FORTY FIVE MILLION ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WITH THE SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BILL LISTA LOOK RATHER PUNY YOU KNOW IS IS THAT TO DRESS THE THE PROBLEM AFFORD. IF WE'RE GONNA INVITE MORE PEOPLE TO GO TO THE PARKS WORE. THOSE TAHOE AREA WHEREVER WHEREVER THEY'RE GOING SAID THAT'S THAT'S A CONCERN AGAIN I KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ON A LEAN AND MEAN. A TEAM HERE AS FAR AS PENNY PENSION BUT BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO PAY AS YOU GO I MEAN THAT'S IT AND ANOTHER THING. SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SECURING THE MORNING -- AND GOOD MORNING MR KERRY KRATZ. REALLY GLAD THAT YOU'RE THERE. I'M JUST A FEW ITEMS INTO SOME COMMENTS AND LOOK TO YOUR REACTION IN SOME OF THESE ITEMS WE TALKED. ABOUT AS WELL BUT I'D LIKE TO GO TO START OUT. IN ANOTHER CHAIR IS GOING TO DO A DEEP DIVE ON ALL ISSUES A PROP SIXTY EIGHT HERE NOT JUST A BIT ALL THIS AGING ERIC LEE -- I THINK AT LEAST FOR MYSELF. THE LEGISLATION IS BE TO DO A DEEPER DIVE ON WHAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED HERE TODAY. AND I THINK THAT -- UNDERSTANDING WHERE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO IN I GUESS EXPEDITE BUT AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH -- WE NEED TO TAKE SOME TIME TO PAY TO INSURE THAT WE ARE. INVESTING ACCURATELY IN STRATEGICALLY ENDING. AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR SAYING IT'S HOLD THIS BUT AS THESE LARGE EXPENDITURES COME FORWARD A BILLION DOLLARS. NEEDING TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN AS SOME ADDITIONAL TIME TOGETHER -- BUT DEMONSTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO FLUSH THAT OUT NOW TO SAY THAT -- UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE CONTINUED FOCUS ON FIRE WE ARE A LONG WAY TO GO I APPRECIATE RECOVERING MISSION HAS BEEN -- AND I STILL HAVE SOME DEEP CONCERN THAT WERE NOT UP TO MADE SEVEN NINETEEN SEVENTY STAFFING LEVELS AND I THINK THAT'S A ANOTHER ITEM THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CONTINUE. TO TALK ABOUT THIS YEAR UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING CAL FOR CALIFORNIA HERE TODAY. HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE YET TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO STATE PARKS -- BAND I THINK THE WORLD OF MISMA GIRK WHO'S HERE TODAY SHE DOES A FANTASTIC JOB AND UNFORTUNATELY ALWAYS TAKE SO MANY PHONE CALLS. ON AND BUT WHAT I'LL SAY IS. WE WE HAVE A BOTTOM LINE TO BE ABLE TO HIT. BUT FOR US TO EVER THINK THAT STATE PARKS IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BREAK EVEN. IS LUDICROUS BUT STATE PARKS OFFERS A STRONGER AND BIGGER BENEFIT TO THE VOTERS OF THE STATE AND CANDIDLY SOME OF THE BEST RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE IN% THE WEST. I AND HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR ANNUAL PASS CHEAPER LONGER TERM WE ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE ANNUAL PASSES. HERE IN THE NATION ARE AND HOW WE'RE GONNA BE OUR TO GET COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN THE STATE PARKS. I KNOW IN ONE AS WE DISCUSSED AT THE SINCE NUMBER COUNTY OUR REGIONAL PARK SYSTEM -- AND THAT TARGETS THOSE KIDS FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS OUR REGIONAL PARKS AND HOW WE CAN LOOK AT A PILOT PROJECT SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- AGAIN BLATANT ISSUE READING I GET THEM IN A LIBRARY AND TO BE A TO GET THEM OUT JUST TRYING TO LOOK AT PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE IS AN INNOVATIVE IDEAS. BECAUSE WHERE I HAVE FELT SOME FRUSTRATION IS WE HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY BOTTOM LINE DRIVEN. BY STATE PARKS IN -- BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SO BOTTOM LINE DRIVEN WE ARE A CURTAIN WHAT WE SAY WE SAY WE WANT EXPAND ACCESS THE MORE EXPENSIVE WE MAKE IT. OUT TO BE A TO GET INTO A STATE PARK MORE CHALLENGING IT'S GOING TO BE FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND SENIORS AND COMMITTEES A COLOR TO BE ABLE TO GET IN. TO WHAT WE SAY WE NEED TO EXPAND -- AND LONG TERM WE NEED TO BE ABLE DEVELOP ALL UP A SUSTAINABLE REVENUE SOURCE FOR OPERATIONS IN THE BILL TO IMPLEMENT THESE. INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS YOU JUST WOULD LIKE YOU TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON POINT TAKEN. YOU KNOW PART OF ACCESSIBILITY IS AFFORDABILITY. AND TO YOUR POINT IF IT IS ON AFFORDABLE ARE FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO ACTUALLY ACCESS OUR STATE PARKS THAT'S THAT THE CHALLENGE NOT THE PROBLEM -- STATE PARKS HAS COME A LONG WAY OUR TOWARDS. AB STRENGTHENING ITS BUDGET AND THAT HAS MEANT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT REVENUE IDEAS ON THE TABLE BUT I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR THAT. AT SOME POINT -- THE NEED TO GENERATE REVENUE HAS TO BE BALANCED WITH THE ARE. IMPERATIVE TO KEEP PARKS AFFORDABLE. AND I THINK THAT. pSHOULD BE THE MOST POPULAR DEPARTMENT WITHIN -- ALL DEPARTMENTS HERE IN THE STATE. AND THAT THERE IS A GREATER VALUE THAN JUST THE BOTTOM LINE WHEN IT COMES TO STATE PARKS I ALSO LOOK AT IT IS ESPECIALLY IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS. SOME OF THE MOST IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE THEY'RE HUGE ECONOMIC DRIVERS FOR COMMUNITIES AND WE ALSO NEED TAKE THAT ACCOUNT. AND PREACHING THE CHOIR HERE NOT AT ALL TRYING TO LECTURE NINE I LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU SIR THANK YOU THANKS [inaudible] STERN. YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WELCOME THE SECRETARY. GOT A BIG THE YEAH BIG PLATE HERE IN FRONT OF YOU IT'S IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY THIS COMING YEAR AND JUST APPRECIATE THE MAGNITUDE THE TASK IN. SAID TO HAVE YOU BACK IN THIS ADMINISTRATION TWO IN A ROW -- IT'S GOOD -- AT THE RESILIENCY PERSPECTIVE I LOOK A LOT OF US HERE FIND TO BE CENTRAL BADLANDS HAVING GONE THROUGH. THE CATASTROPHES WE'VE BEEN THROUGH -- TO APPRECIATE THAT SORT OF CENTRAL FOCUS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SEPARATE HEARINGS ON WITH CAL FIRE IN SORT OF DIGGING DEEPER INTO BUT I DID APPRECIATE IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS TALK ABOUT. GETTING DOLLARS AN ACTION GOING RIGHT NOW THE FORTY FIVE AIRPORT JUST DROP I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE STEP. TO JUST GET MOVING -- I I DID WANT TO SORT OF RAISE THIS ISSUE AROUND -- NOT S. R. AREAS RIGHT AND THAT THE COMPLEXITIES THAT WE HAVE IT JUST TO GET YOUR GENERAL TAKE ON SORT OF THE CHALLENGE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S PERSPECTIVE WE MIGHT HAVE OF WE'RE GONNA PUT. CERTAIN FUNDS ASIDE TO GO TAKE ON FUEL REDUCTION AND OTHER SORT OF BROAD RESOURCES RESILIENCY PROJECTS. BUT HOW HOW DO YOU SEE THAT PARTNERSHIP WORKING WITH SAY COUNTIES MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS -- OTHER THAT YOU KNOW COULD GO CONSERVANCY'S TO OTHERS ARE LOCAL PARTNERS HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THAT RELATIONSHIP WHEN YOU'RE SORT OF STRATEGICALLY ASSESSING. THE BUDGET IN THIS RESILIENCE HERE WHILE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS IN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ESSENTIAL SO -- DURING THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION -- I HELP TO STAND UP THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE AND IF YOU RECALL A FEW YEARS AGO. I WAS REALLY WE STARTED TO UNDERSTAND THIS EPIDEMIC OF ART. DYING TREES ACROSS THE SIERRA AND LITERALLY TREES WERE FALLING -- IN THE IN THE ROADS AND ON BUILDINGS ACROSS THE SIERRA NEVADA. WE QUICKLY REALIZED ENDING UP THAT TASK FORCE. IS LOCAL PARTICIPATION WAS ESSENTIAL. BECAUSE THESE LOCAL LEADERS IN THEIR AGENCIES ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND THEY CAN DEPLOY RESOURCES MORE QUICKLY AND FRANKLY MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. SOMETIMES IN STATE GOVERNMENT -- CAN THING THAT I'M REALLY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE GOVERNOR EARLIER THIS WEEK -- APPOINTED A NEW DIRECTOR OF HIS GOVERNOR'S A FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A WOMAN NAMED JENNIFER MONTGOMERY WHO'S BEEN A PLASTER COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR THELAST TEN YEARS. WHO HAS BEEN LIVING AND WORKING ON THIS ISSUE -- IN HER COMMUNITY I AND I THINK THAT APPOINTMENT WAS MADE IN PART RECOGNIZING THAT THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING -- LOCAL TO THE TABLE ESSENTIAL PARTNERS -- AND NOT AS SUBSIDIARIES ABOUT TRULY CENTRAL PARTNER SO I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL MOVING FORWARD IN THE WE WE WANT THEM TO PARTNERS TO YOU I MEAN MY MY CONCERN IS IF IF. ONE PARTICULAR LOCALITY DRAG THEIR HEELS DOESN'T WANT TO SPEND FUNDS WE'RE GOING IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS DO IN OUR WORK. AND THEN YOU KNOW MAYBE WERE CONTRACTING WITH THEM BUT THAT'S NOT OCCURRING I JUST WONDER HOW TO BUILD EITHER MORE INCENTIVES FOR YOU KNOW MORE ACCOUNTABILITY FRANKLY TO MAKE SURE THAT. THIS RESILIENCY HAVE PUSHES BEINGS ARE UNIFIED ACROSS ALL THERE'S GOVERNMENT SO IT'S NOT THAT I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ALL ON TO WHICH IS. TO SEEMS LIKE A CRITICAL PIECE BECAUSE EVEN GOING THROUGH CAL FIRES PRIOR TO MAPS RIGHT LIKE THERE'S THE FIRE ZONES ARE IT'S PATCHWORK YEAH AND GETTING THROUGH THOSE JURISDICTIONAL PATCHWORK YEAH I MEAN I THINK YOU RAISE AN IMPORTANT POINT IN IT'S COMPLICATED AND AND I THINK THAT. THE YOU KNOW WHERE WE UNPACK SOME OF THE COMPLEXITY IS ON THAT TASK FORCE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU DIRECTLY. EIGHT ONE OTHER QUESTION IF YOU DON'T MIND LET ME FOLLOW UP ON THE INJURY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD ARGUE THAT BY SUSPENDING THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR FEE. THE PEOPLE BELOW LOCAL FOLKS DON'T HAVE ANY SKIN IN THE GAME ANYMORE WE'RE BACK FEELING EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THERE'S A VARIETY REQUEST HERE THAT ON IT JUST IN THE FIRE COMING FORGET IF WE WE HAVE A CAP AND TRADE. THAT THAT'S AN ARGUMENT THAT SAYING THIS IS A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN WE ANTICIPATED AND IT WAS A EXPEDIENCY THAT WAS YOU KNOW -- WE'D WE DID THAT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WELL I WILL WAX CAREFULLY -- YET AGAIN ON THIS -- YEAH THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT -- YOU KNOW POLICY DISCUSSION ON THE ONE HAND THERE WAS A REVENUE STREAM THAT COULD. THAT COULD GENERATE RESOURCES FOR CAL FIRE IN THOSE AREAS WHERE IT IS WORKING BUT THEY'RE ALSO REAL AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS IN THOSE RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND WE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE WE THINK ABOUT URBAN COMMUNITIES BUT ACTUALLY A LOT OF THESE SMALLER -- COMMUNITIES IN THAT WILD LAND URBAN INTERFACE UP TO GO IN THE MOUNTAINS ARE DISADVANTAGED -- SO AGAIN IT'S HIS BALANCE QUESTION MAYBE NOT A SATISFYING ANSWER FOR YOU BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BALANCE THE NEED TO GENERATE RESOURCES FOR CAL FIRE. AND THEN AVOIDING. DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I GO BACK TO THE THEME OF HAVING SOME SKIN IN THE GAME WHO HAD -- AND IN WE'RE IN A NEW DIMENSION RIGHT NOW ABOUT WE'RE RETHINKING THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT. FIVE YEARS AGO WAS GIVEN THE CATASTROPHES THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT IT SENATOR I'M SORRY PLEASE CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION AND I WOULD SAY JUST BUILDING ON THAT. ALL LACKS LESS CAREFULLY AND MAYBE NOT PARTICULAR POETICALLY EITHER BUT TRYING TO THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT. THE COMMUNITIES THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT WHAT IS SKIN IN THE GAME LOOK LIKE RIGHT LIKE I I KNOW THAT -- PARADISES DIFFERENT AMOUNT. AND I KNOW THE MALIBU WANTS TO STEP UP AND WHAT AND WANTS TO PUSH AND IS WILLING TO TAKE -- COST ON TO DO SO AND WANTS TO REBUILD RESILIENCY PRESENTLY BUT SO HOW HOW DO WE SORT OF THAT GOOD WILL THAT WE'VE GOT FROM SOME IMPACTED AREAS THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT VERSUS THOSE THAT CAN'T AND I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY IN THAT SAME OLD FRAMEWORK EITHER IT'S JUST. SOME OF THE PUZZLE ON AS WE GO FORWARD IN THIS I THINK IT'S A GREAT POINT ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL THESE ARE VERY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES -- I WILL JUST MENTION BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SO CALLED HOME HARDENING YES -- AND REALLY WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES TO YOU KNOW PART OF THIS IS REALLY REDUCING THE FIRE THREAT AS IT APPROACHES A COMMUNITY BUT PART OF THIS IS ACTUALLY PROTECTING THE HOMES IN THE COMMUNITY. PARTICULARLY GIVEN A LOT OF THESE FIRES ARE INCREASINGLY WIND DRIVEN WE HAVE EMBERS LEADING -- THE FIRE SO IN IN SOME OF THESE IT'S A DAY -- CHALLENGES IS HOW DO YOU HELP THOSE ARE RESIDENTS ACTUALLY -- PROTECT THEIR HOMES YOU KNOW ON THEIR OWN PROPERTY THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE IN THE SORT OF BASIC GUIDELINES ARE A CRITICAL AND AND CENTER MCGUIRE AND I ARE ACTUALLY DOING. TO A HEARING JOINTLY WITH THE S. AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AT THAT YOUR AGENCY MAYBE WANTED A TENDER OR AT LEAST OBSERVER AT PARTICIPATE IN I I KNOW WE'RE HAVING A VARIETY TESTIMONY ON THAT TOPIC -- AND TRYING TO SORT ASK SOME OF THOSE HARD QUESTIONS ONE OTHER TOPIC IF I MIGHT RAISE IT -- WELL WE GOT YOU HERE IS IN THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT CATEGORY WHICH I KNOW DOVE TAILS HERE BECAUSE YOU ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO ALIGN FOCUS. IN MITIGATING SOME OF THESE CLIMATE RISKS WE'VE GOT BUT I I WOULD SECOND THE THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES JUST IN TERMS OF IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH GETTING THROUGH IT JUST BECAUSE THE NATURE OF HOW YOUR PC P. WAS STRUCTURED RIGHT SO IT'S ONE BIG. CHUNK AND I APPRECIATE WE SORT OF STARTED TO TRY TO BREAK THINGS OUT IN THE ISSUES BUT JUST AS A GENERAL MATTER I KNOW WE WANTED TO WORK THROUGH IT BECAUSE WE GET THAT SORT OF FOCUS ON A SORT OF STREAMLINED PROPOSAL BUT IT. IT'S HARDER TO ANALYZE. EACH ITEM WHEN IT'S SORT OF NOT BROKEN OUT BUT FROM WHAT I COULD GLEAN FROM IT I DO I JUST WANTED. TO I GUESS -- ASK SPECIFICALLY IN IN THIS SORT OF THERE'S THERE'S STORMWATER URBAN STREAMS. AND MULTI BENEFITS STORM WATER CATEGORIES THAT ALL KIND OF OVERLAP OR HAVE SORT OF DIFFERENT PURPOSES BUT LA RIVER IS IT IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR US IN THE ENTIRE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION -- IT'S BOTH A LIABILITY AND AN ASSET -- COUNTIES REALLY SEEM TO STEP UP IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING WITH THE STATE LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS LIKE THEY THEY SEEM TO REALLY -- BE WILLING TO PUT THEIR SKIN IN THE GAME UP FRONT PASSED A MEASURE LOCALLY I THINK THAT COULD HELP -- I WE APPRECIATE SOME OF THE THE FUNDS BOTH GOING THROUGH THE CONSERVANCY AS WELL AS THROUGH THESE MULTI BENEFITS STORM WATER PROJECTS. I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE. THE THESE MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN JUST THE STRAIGHT FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECTS. AND I GET THE PUBLIC SAFETY RISKS AROUND CERTAIN PARTS SAY OF THAT WHOLE. FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO SHORE UP BUT I'M WONDERING IF YOU THINK. YOU KNOW IS THERE GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO KIND OF REALIZE THAT BIGGER PICTURE VISION BECAUSE WE DON'T JUST WANT TO SHORE UP LA IS A MATTER OF FLOOD PROTECTION I THINK WE CAN SOLVE THAT THAT CHALLENGE. BUT WE WANTED TO TRULY BE A LIVING BREATHING -- PLACE FOR RECREATION AND AND TO IT REALLY DOES SLICE RIGHT THROUGH THE THE PLACES WHERE YOU KNOW CAN OF THE PARK IS THE LOS INCOME PART OF THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT WE GOT NOW THE FORTY FIVE MINUTES AWAY. THESE KIDS NEVER SEEN A BEACH IN THEIR LIFE LOOKS LIKE -- THERE SAID RIGHT AT THE FOOT HILLS THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS BUT THEY DON'T DON'T GET THERE LIKE THEY'RE BUSY SCRAPING THROUGH AND SO. THAT LA RIVER SITTING RIGHT THERE IN IN THEIR HOME AND HE MAY BE THE CLOSEST THING THAT KIND OF COMMUNITY GETS. TO GETTING OUT PARK POVERTY GETTING THE FEELING OF YOU KNOW WHAT IS TO BE OUT THERE SO. JUST GENERAL SENSE ON THIS IN THIS LA RIVER ISSUE AND AND HOW I'D EAT IT HE DOES HAVE A SORT OF REGIONAL DIMENSION. BUT WE THINK IT'S A UNIQUE PROJECT ACROSS THE DELEGATION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JUST AS A SOMETHING THAT IS COHERENT UNSOLVABLE BUT I DON'T KNOW JUST. YES WELL TO SHARE MAYBE A COUPLE OF OF A HIGH LEVEL TO THE PHILSOPHICAL TALKS AND THEN SPECIFICALLY SPEAK THE LA RIVER -- AS CHAIRMAN WHITE HOUSE HE SAID YOU KNOW OUR NEEDS OUT SHIP OUR RESOURCES. ACROSS THE BOARD AND SO THAT THAT WOULD THE PROMISE OF MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS IS WERE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW -- GETTING. I WAS GONNA SAY KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE BUT PROBABLY NOT AN APPROPRIATE METAPHOR FOR THAT. OUR RESOURCES SECRETARY BUT BUT IN ANY EVENT -- IN ANY EVENT WE WE WE NEED IF WE NEED TO PURSUE THESE PROJECTS THAT ACTUALLY GET MORE. ADDRESS MANY OF OUR PRIORITIES AT ONCE SO -- FLOOD IS A PERFECT ONE WOULD BE YEAR YOU RAISE AN EXAMPLE OF AN URBAN PROJECT THAT ACTUALLY CAN HAVE SO MANY MORE BENEFITS BEYOND FLOOD CONTROL. IN THE ROLE CONTACTS BOB IN DOWN THE CENTRAL VALLEY EXPANDING SO FLOOD PLAINS. IS NOT ONLY A COST EFFECTIVE WAY I'M FLOOD THREATS IT ALSO PROVIDES HABITAT TO ENDANGERED SALMON AND IN MANY CASES ALLOWS FOR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AT CIGNA COMES INTO A FACT. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT HAS TO BE ONE OF OUR ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES OF INVESTMENTS IS MULTI BENEFIT. SECONDLY I THINK AS IT RELATES TO YOU KNOW A BIG PROJECT LIKE THE LA RIVER -- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES YOU KNOW -- WE HAVE WITH BONDS ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE OFTEN CAREFULLY WRITTEN SO THERE ARE A LOT OF YOU KNOW SEPARATE THEIR SEPARATE OP CHAPTERS OR PRINT OUT OR SECTIONS THAT HAVE THEIR OWN FUNDING POOLS. THE ONE WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS CAN COMPETE -- FOR FOR A MULTIPLE STREAMS BUT I WOULD SAY MORE BROADLY -- WE HAVE TO UPDATE OUR OUR FUNDING APPROACH FOR THESE MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS IN OTHER WORDS YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD TRADITIONAL -- DIVISIONS BETWEEN FLOOD WATER SUPPLY FOR EXAMPLE WELL WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HAVE A PROJECT DOES BOTH RIGHT WE HAVE TO UPDATE THAT. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK TO DOT DIRECTOR NEED MATH ARE WHO LEADS THAT APARTMENT WATER RESOURCES HE'S DONE SOME REALLY EXCITING WORK ACTUALLY DOING SOME RESTRUCTURING AND HER DEPARTMENT TO REALLY -- ELEVATE THIS THIS CONCEPT OF MULTI BENEFIT. I AND SO WE JUST NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR POLICIES AND PROGRAMS KEEP UP WITH THAT. OF OUR FOLLOW UP. I'LL MAKE IT. REALLY QUICK -- AND I I JUST DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE S. R. A DISCUSSION. WITH OUT IN BEING ONE OF THE FEW RULE AREA ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT BUDGET DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK OUT BIPARTISAN DO I MIGHT ADD. ON THE S. R. A FEE AND WHAT WE SIGNED MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES IS THAT BECAUSE OF THAT HUNDRED NINETEEN HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLAR FEE. AND YOU HAVE A LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT VOLUNTEER FIRE COMPANY FIRE DISTRICT THEY DESPERATELY NEEDED REVENUE THEY COULDN'T PASS IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE S. OR A FEE ON THEIR HOME. AND CAL FIRED ANYMORE TO RESPOND WHEN THERE IS A FIRE OR MEDICAL EMERGENCY BUT THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DID. SO THERE ARE MANY RAMIFICATIONS IF WE WERE TO PUT THAT BACK IN -- I WOULD SAY IS I THINK WE NEED TO TREAD VERY CAREFULLY -- ON THAT SUBJECT FOR BUT I KNOW THAT'S FOR DIFFERENT. THAT EVERYBODY ALSO KNOWS THAT. THEY ARE WAIVED IN THE SENSE OF EMERGENCY RIGHT SO THE FEES THERE THERE'S THAT BACKSTOPS THAT. BUT I I APPRECIATE THE UNFAIRNESS OF HAVING SOMEBODY PAY TWICE FOR LOCAL AND A STATE AND OTHERS JUST SAYING OKAY LET. THE FOR SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR IME AND WE WILL THIS. ON THE ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE THE BUDGET WE WILL BE USING THE THE LA DOES BREAK DOWN OF ON THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT WE WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF AND FINANCE. THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW -- CLARITY ABOUT WHAT WOULD IT IS WERE ASKING FOR AND ONE OF THE CATEGORIES BECAUSE WE WE UNDERSTAND LIMITATIONS IS YOU'VE YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED BUT THERE IS SOME. WIGGLE ROOM HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOME FOLKS TO BE ADVOCATES FOR THE UPPER LOS AT AT LOS ANGELES REVERSES THE DOWNSTREAM LOZENGES RIVERTON IN. DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST IN CENTRAL COAST SO WE'RE WE HAVE A BALANCING ACT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU. AND WITH THAT LET'S. GO TO OUR BRIEFING ON A PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND BRING UP THE ALEJO. MISS ACT [inaudible] L. [inaudible] SELLERS [inaudible] EHLERS. ANYWAYS GUESS SCREWED UP. M.. THANK YOU. FOR A WONDERFUL CHART AND SOME CLARITY THAT THAT HE'D. YEAH AND ON THIS TONIGHT LE PORCHER PRESENTATION WE HAVE OUR HANDS OUT FROM PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING RETAILERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- SO THE SERGEANT HAS PASSED A HAND OUT IT IS ALSO AVAILABLE ONLINE ON OUR WEBSITE -- AND I'VE BEEN ASKED TO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW IT KIND OF FROM THE HIGH LEVEL AND THEN I THINK YOU'LL DIVE INTO A FEW OF THE ISSUES -- SUBSEQUENT TO THAT. THIRTEEN PAGE ONE PROPOSITION SIXTY IT WAS PUT ON THE BALLOT BY THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH SB FIVE LAST YEAR IN APPROVED BY VOTERS IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PROVIDING FOUR POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. IT DOES HAVE A NUMBER OF VERY SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OVER SEVENTY FIVE DISCRETE -- CATEGORIES FOR THE MOST PART IT'S KIND OF CATEGORIES FOR TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THERE AREN'T A LOT OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR VERY SPECIFIC PROJECTS MOST OF THE CATEGORIES ARE FOR A DEPARTMENTS TO RUN COMPETITIVE GRANTS NOT ALL OF THEM. SOME OF THEM CAN BE USED FOR STATE INITIATED ACTIVITIES BUT MOST MOSTLY FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS -- THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THE BOND TO DIRECTING FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES CERTAIN PERCENTAGES OF THE FUNDING. AND THEY'RE ALSO PROVISIONS THAT FOR EXAMPLE WOULD WAIVE LOCAL COST SHARE REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES. EVEN THOUGH THE BOND WAS JUST APPROVED BY VOTERS LAST JUNE THERE WAS OVER A BILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET BY THE LEGISLATURE TO GET PROJECTS GOING. MOST OF THOSE APPROPRIATIONS LAST YEAR WHEN THE CURRENT YEAR WERE FOUR CATEGORIES OF ACTIVITIES IN PROGRAMS THAT WERE ALREADY THE STATE WAS ALREADY RUNNING SO THEY WERE READY TO HIT THE GROUND IMMEDIATELY. AND THEN SOME FUNDING PROVIDED FOR IT STATE AGENCIES TO GET READY TO INITIATE NEW PROGRAMS -- SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO WE'VE GOT A SUMMARY HERE OF THE EACH CATEGORY WE WE DID SOME CONSOLIDATING WE DIDN'T SHOW ALL SEVENTY FIVE I THINK THOSE ARE ALL BROKEN OUT IN YOUR AGENDA BUT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT -- MORE CONSOLIDATED SEE HOW MUCH THE BOND PROVIDES HOW MUCH WAS PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND THEN THE PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR IN THE FINAL COLUMN THAT IS BEFORE YOU FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. I'LL HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS YOU CAN SEE AND THE RIGHT HAND COLUMN THERE ARE SEVERAL CATEGORIES I HAVE VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY PROPOSED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THAT'S USUALLY BECAUSE IN MOST CASES BECAUSE LARGER AMOUNTS WERE PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR -- THERE ARE FEW AREAS WHERE NO FUNDING IS PROVIDED ARE VERY SMALL ACROSS THE TWO YEARS AND THAT'S GENERALLY BECAUSE EITHER A DEPARTMENTS ARE STILL GETTING READY TO RUN THOSE PROGRAMS -- AND ARE READY TO SPEND THE FUNDS YET -- OR THEY HAVE BOND FUNDING FROM PREVIOUS BONDS THAT ARE STILL AVAILABLE SO WE'RE KIND OF HOLDING OFF ON THE PROPOSITION. SIXTY EIGHT A HIGHLIGHT A FEW FOR YOU AND THAT RIGHT HAND COLUMN THAT I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DISCUSS AND SUB IN THE NEXT PIECES OF THE AGENDA. SPECIFICALLY THE THIRD ITEM DOWN SEVENTY MILLION FOR VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS THAT'S THE NEW EFFORT BY THE STATE THAT -- YOU'VE GOT DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT -- AND THEN DOWN IN THE BOTTOM CATEGORY UNDER WATER QUITE A BIT OF FUNDING FOR FLOOD IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS ACROSS A FEW DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION FOR SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT THERE WAS FUNDING FOR THAT PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUT THE CURRENT YOUR FUNDING IS PRIMARILY FOR PLANNING. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME OR PROVIDING MONEY FOR IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGMA. AND THEN THE MULTI BENEFIT STORM WATER PROGRAMS NINETY THREE MILLION THAT'S A NEW ANOTHER NEW PROGRAM THE STATE IS INITIATING -- THE CHILL TALK ABOUT TODAY SO IF YOU. ADOPT ALL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS THAT WOULD AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE YEARS. I KNOW YOU PROBABLY GOT SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BUT A MOVE TO ARC -- OVERALL COMMENTS HERE ON PAGE. THREE SO AB OVERALL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SEEM CONSISTENT WITH THE BOND LANGUAGE AND VOTER INTENT WE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING WILD AND CRAZY IN OUR LOOK AT WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING. BUT AS HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED BY A FEW OF YOU ON THE DíAS THERE WAS A LACK OF DETAIL IN THE PRESENTATION FROM FROM THE GOVERNOR ON THESE PROPOSALS THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT. TO TO DIVE DEEP INTO UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT THAT SOME OF THE PROPOSALS REALLY ARE FOR SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR MANY YEARS THAT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS CONCERNING. FOR SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BRAND NEW THIS YEAR IT REALLY. WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS MORE DETAIL ON HOW WELL THE FUNDING BE SPENT WHY IS THIS AMOUNT THE AMOUNT THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THIS YEAR. FOR NEW STAFF THERE FIFTEEN NEW STAFF PROPOSED WAY WHY ARE THEY NECESSARY WHAT WHAT ACTIVITIES WILL THEY BE UNDERTAKING -- SO I WILL WANT TO GIVE THEN MINISTRATION CREDIT THEY'VE BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO ALL OF OUR% QUESTIONS AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION BUT OF COURSE. THAT INFORMATION IS NOT AS EASILY ACCESSIBLE FROM THE PUBLIC AS IT WOULD BE HAD IT BEEN PROVIDED IN A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL SO THEY'VE BEEN VERY RECEPTIVE ABOUT THIS FEEDBACK AND I THINK. WILL IMPROVE THE PROCESS MOVING FORWARD BUT IT DOES THAT PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE ONUS ON YOU TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE APPROVING THESE PROPOSALS. SO WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD STARTING PLACE FOR YOU BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY TO PROCEED -- THERE YOU COULD CHOOSE TO PUT MORE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES OR LESS FUNDING FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO USE. THE SPRING BUDGET PROCESS TO REALLY GET FEET HOLDERS FROM IMPLEMENTING DEPARTMENTS THERE MAY BE CERTAIN CASES WHERE THE GOVERNOR HASN'T PROPOSED FUNDING WHERE THERE IS DEMAND READY TO GO NOW AND PROJECTS READY TO APPLY NOW WERE YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN. THERE COULD ALSO BE CATEGORIES WHERE YOU LEARNED THAT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF PREVIOUS BOND FUNDING THAT'S GONE UNSPENT AND MAYBE THEY'RE NOT READY FOR THIS AMOUNT OF PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR YET SO -- AS ALWAYS WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU ADOPT A PACKAGE THAT REFLECTS YOUR PRIORITIES BUT WE DO THINK THIS IS A DECENT STARTING PLACE. SOMEONE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE THINGS SEEM TO BE HIDDEN IS THAT YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE FIRST HAD THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT WE SAW SOME. ARE PROJECTS OF JUST PICK ON HEALTHY SOILS THAT WERE BEING USE OF THAT WERE BEING FUNDED BY CAP AND TRADE FUNDS THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN. THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS DRIED UP IN AND WE HAVE NINE MILLION. BROUGHT IN HERE -- FOR UNDER A PROP SIXTY EIGHT WHICH IS ALMOST 90% OF WHAT THE FUNDS WERE SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THOSE. IMPORTANT GROWING PROGRAMS RIGHT AND AND I GUESS THE THE CHALLENGES ON RECONCILING THOSE THINGS SO THAT WE'RE THE STATE AS A WHOLE IS. IS -- GETTING THE JOB DONE. I AM. HOW CAN YOU HELP US OUT ON THAT YEAH I THINK OUR ADVICE WOULD BE TO LOOK AT THE BUDGET AS A PACKAGE WITH ALL OF YOUR DIFFERENT RESOURCES IDENTIFY WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE AND THEN FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO FIND THEM SO DON'T LOOK AT PROP IS INTERESTED? IN SIXTY EIGHT AT IN A SILO AS A VACUUM DON'T LOOK AT D. G. R. F. FUNDS IN A VACUUM BUT KIND OF IDENTIFY YOUR PRIORITIES AND THEN LOOK ACROSS FUNDING SOURCES OF THE BEST WAY INVEST COMBINATION TO FUND THEM CENTER MONNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. ON YOUR SHIRT PAGE TWO UNDER THE WATER SAFE DRINKING WATER. HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION -- IN MY CORRECT IN MONEY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THAT CAN ONLY BE USED FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS NOT FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. THAT'S CORRECT THIS IS THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM -- THAT THE WATER BOARD RUNS I THINK THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE ARE SOME LOANS AND SOME GRANTS BUT IT'S THE IT'S ESTABLISH PROGRAM THEY THEY BLEND IT WITH -- FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL AND YEAH THIS IS ONE TIME MONEY SO IT'S TYPICALLY IS FOR THOSE ONE TIME PROJECTS THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION I THINK THE GOVERNOR. HIGHLIGHTED THIS IN HIS INTRODUCTION OF THE BUDGET -- BUT IMPORTANT WITH ARE SAFE DRINKING WATER CHALLENGES. THIS HELPS BUT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE THE ONGOING NANCE ON GOING NEEDS THANK YOU. AND ONLY ON THE PARKS BUDGET BECAUSE IT IS YOU KNOW AGAIN IF BASED ON THE BILLION DOLLARS WERE OVER THE HALFWAY PART. IN IT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE LOWER. COST COASTAL ACCOMMODATIONS IS FLAT LINING AT ZERO WITHIN SPEND ANY MONEY LAST TIME AND THEN THERE MAY BE AN EXPLANATION SOME OF THE OTHER CATEGORIES -- YOU KNOW IMPROVE AND EXPAND STATE PARKS THERE'S LOCAL PARK SEEMS WE WERE SPENDING THE MONEY WE JUST HAD A INTERESTING CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NEED AND THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ALL THAT [inaudible] THE SERVER. DID YOU WERE YOU ABLE TO UNCOVER WHY THERE WOULDN'T WHAT WE WOULDN'T BE SPENDING SAY EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS ON IMPROVING. THAT THE STATE PARKS YEAH SO. PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT ON THE LOWER COST COASTAL ACCOMMODATIONS THIS IS TO IMPLEMENT A BILL THAT PASSED THAT FIRST REQUIRED AN ASSESSMENT TO BE DONE OF WHAT THE EXISTING ACCOMMODATIONS ARE THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY WAS UNDERTAKING THEY CAME OUT WITH THE DRAFT AND DECEMBER I THINK AND ARE IN THE PROCESS. OF FINALIZING SO I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION WAS WAITING FOR THE ASSESSMENT BEFORE I'M PUTTING FORTH THE FUNDING SO WE MAY SEE SOME OF THAT IN APRIL OR MAY AS THAT ASSESSMENT IS DONE TO GUIDE HOW THAT FUNDING SHOULD BE SPENT. AND THERE'S THIRTY MILLION FOR PARKS AND THIRTY MILLION FOR THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY IN THAT CATEGORY -- FOR THE OTHER. CATEGORIES A PARKS I'M I WILL HAVE TO DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT ON ON WHY. THEY TOOK THE APPROACH THEY DID MY MY PRESUMPTION WOULD BE THAT THERE'S QUITE QUITE A LOT IN THE CURRENT YEAR. YOU KNOW NEARLY HALF OF THAT APPROPRIATION -- FOR IMPROVING AND EXPANDING LOCAL PARK SO MAYBE THAT THEY'RE WAITING FOR THAT MANY TO KIND OF PERCOLATE DOWN AND AND THEN ROLL OUT THE NEXT BUT AGAIN I'LL DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT I'M SURE I KNOW THEY'RE HERE. ALL I GET THAT I GET IT ON THE LOCAL PARK TICKETS THE STATE PARKS THE STATE PARK SEEMS TO BE RATHER DRY FINANCE WITH THE WE DO HAVE A THE BRING CASH FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE HERE FROM THE THE DEPARTMENT STATE PARKS WOULD BE. FINANCES I MEAN WE'RE GOOD. I JUST WITHIN WITHIN THE PROPS SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING SO. IT'S HOW COME YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME FOR MORE MONEY. THE BRAIN DO WE STATE PARKS -- THE BUDGET -- GOVERNOR WAS INCLUDES A TOTAL OF EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN -- A COMBINATION OF GENERAL FUND AND PROP SIXTY EIGHT THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT PORTION FOR FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS -- OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD SO OVER OVER FOUR YEARS SO IT'S A TOTAL OF FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT THAT THE THE PROJECTS THAT WE WE FUND -- TAKE TIME TO PERMIT THE DESIGN -- TO TO THE BED AND THEN CONSTRUCTED SO -- ALTHOUGH WE'D LIKE TO GET THE PROJECTS OUT IMMEDIATELY -- WE DO NEED SOME TIME TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND AND AND AND AND BECAUSE OF HIS PROJECTS. BUT I MEAN THIS IS MY THIRD YEAR IN THIS BUT AND THIS PREVIOUSLY WE'VE TOLD JUST ON THE TOILETS THIS ON THE BATHROOM CENTER IN DISREPAIR CLOSE YOU CAN DO THAT MAY NOT BE THE OTHER PART OF IT. THE TRAIL PARKER THE RIVER PARKWAY OR THE OTHER PARTS OF THE PARK BUT THERE JUST SEEMS AT SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS YOU COULD COME UP WITH A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION I MEAN IT'S JUST. NOT EVEN A HUNDRED OF WHAT THE NEED IS. I I I I GUESS I WOULD ASK THAT WE GO BACK BECAUSE I'M SURE I CAN GET SOME INPUT FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON WHERE THE PARK NEED IS IS THAT SOME OF THESE PROJECTS THAT MAY BE READY TO GO -- THAT MAY HAVE BECAUSE WHEN THE TENANTS OF THE SECRETARY IS TO HAVE MORE ACCESS TO THE TO THE PARKS SO IT SEEMS AS THOUGH AGAIN IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE DO IT EARLIER. PEOPLE. GET MORE BENEFIT AND AND THAT THEY IMPROVEMENTS OCCUR SO -- THE JUST WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND IN LESS I MEAN I GET SALTON SEA I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT READY AND SOME OF THE OTHERS BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THESE CATEGORIES. THEY SHOULD BE POINT WEAKENED BECAUSE WILL SQUABBLE OVER IF WE AGREE WITH YOU. SENATE MCGUIRE. NO I I I I COMPLETELY AGREE OF BEING ABLE I DON'T KNOW AND AND YOU DON'T NEED AN ANSWER HERE TODAY THAT OUT. WHEN STATE PARKS -- ADVANCES JUST LOOKING AT WHAT THE PLAN MAY BE RIGHT SO -- CAN HAVE A GREATER DISCUSSION WITH ADDITIONAL DETAIL AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THE SAME THING WITH THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY. UP WE GOT SIXTY THREE MILLION -- THERE WITH THE CALLS CONSERVANCY. AND NOTHING THAT WOULD BE SPENT. THERE MAY BE FUNDS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS AT THE STILL USING BUT I THERE'S A LOT A NEED ON THE GROUND SO JUST. SAME ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE AS YOU CHAIR ON A STATE PARKS I WOULD SEND THE CALLS CONSERVANCY. YEAH AND I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THE WAY YOUR AGENDA STRUCTURE YOUR DIVING DEEP INTO SOME OF THE PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT PROGRAMS TODAY THAT ARE RUN BY THAT DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE ON YOUR AGENDA TODAY SO THAT MAY BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DAY YOU DO PARKS IN THE DAY YOU. DO ACOSTA ISSUES TO DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER BUT THE TIPPER HANDS HERE. OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. A CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER -- BIGGEST QUESTION FOR LA -- AND FOR PARMA FINANCE -- LONG ONGOING INTENTION OR AND RESOURCES FUNDING WORK CAPITAL VERSUS -- M. AND THE CONSTRAINTS YOU'VE GOT ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND THE HUGE NEEDS WE'VE GOT ON THE SERVICES SIDE OF THINGS. PERSPECTIVES ON SORT OF THE BALLOT STRUCK HERE. WHAT WHAT IS IT? SCOPING THE GAP OR SORT OF DOING THAT WHAT IS THAT BROADER NEEDS ASSESSMENT LOOK LIKE IN THIS THE SUBJECT MATTER AREA AND HOW TO MEASURE A HOW HOW MUCH WE'RE FEELING THAT GAP I GUESS JUST TO GIVE A SISTER A GENERAL SENSE OF A METRIC LIKE. WE ARE WE TACKLING YEAH MINUTE THE GETS INTO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUT IT ALSO GETS AND OTHER ISSUES TO REGULATE WE CAN TALK ABOUT LOW COST BECAUSE ACCOMMODATIONS IN THE CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS NEEDED BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT. PROGRAMS AND SERVICES RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S LIKE A LOT OF THIS IS ABOUT GETTING KIDS TO THE BEACH BECAUSE THEY LITERALLY CAN'T TAKE A THREE HOUR BUS LIKE THEY'VE GOT. TO FIND A WAY TO GET THEIR WAR WHO'S GONNA BE THE COUNSELOR WHEN THEY'RE THERE AND ACCOMMODATING THEM TO MAKE THE LOW COST ACCOMMODATION. ACCOMMODATING YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE PEOPLE AND NO ONE AND SO ANYWAY JUST A LITTLE THOUGHT ON THAT I KNOW MR CASH WE'VE BEEN. DOING THIS WORK FOR YEARS WITH THE SAME AMOUNT CONSERVING FOR EVEN TRYING TO SORT OF FIND THAT SWEET SPOT BUT JUST LITTLE PERSPECTIVE. I CAN GO FIRST. YOU WANNA GO. FOR IT IN THE THANK COMMITTEE CAN BE DEDICATED FROM EACH POT FOR ACTUALLY COMMUNITY ACCESS PROJECTS. SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON ON HOW THAT MONEY CAN ACTUALLY BE SPENT TO GET PEOPLE OUT TO THE PARKS SO TO BRING PEOPLE FROM COMMUNITIES. WHO DON'T NORMALLY GET TO COME OUT TO STAY PARKS LIKE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT? YOU KNOW DON'T NORMALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR THERE IS 5% IN EACH POT IS DEDICATED TO THAT COMMUNITY ACCESS SO WERE WERE WORKING WITH FINANCE ON ACTUALLY FIGURING ON ON WHAT WE CAN SPEND THAT MONEY ON IN ORDER TO INCREASE ACCESS. ACROSS THE BOARD. YEAH AND I WOULD JUST ADD. THE FUNDS TYPICALLY I FROM WE SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF FOR KIND OF LARGE ONE TIME ACTIVITIES FOR SEVERAL REASONS ONE BECAUSE LEGALLY. HAVE FOR THAT'S THAT'S TYPICALLY HOW THEY HAVE TO BE USED TO BECAUSE IT IS ONE TIME MONEY SO IF YOU BUILD UP AN ONGOING SERVICE AND THEN THE FUNDS AREN'T THERE THAT LEADS TO A LOT OF PROBLEMS. AND DISAPPOINTMENT AND THIRD BECAUSE IT AS THE SECRETARY NOTED THAT IT'S NOT FREE MONEY IS NOT CHEAP MONEY IT'S KIND OF EXPENSIVE MONEY -- BECAUSE OF THAT THE DEBT SERVICE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO REALLY FOCUSING ON THOSE LARGE PROJECTS THAT NEED AN UP FRONT INFUSION HAVE. FUNDING -- AND AND THAT MAKES THE TRADE OFF FOR THAT THE FACT THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL HAVE TO BE PAYING IT OFF. IN AND SO IN TERMS OF MY QUESTION ABOUT. ASSESSING NEED AND SORT OF MEASURING OUR SUCCESS TOWARDS AT LEAST SOME BASIC GOALS. WE RECOGNIZE. RESOURCES A TOUGH PLACE TO TO HAVE REALLY CONCRETE METRICS OF WHAT WHAT IS A RESILIENT CALIFORNIA LOOK LIKE LIKE HOW DO WE DEFINE WHAT IS ACT LIKE WHAT IS FULL LACKS ACCESS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA FOR ALL ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE. IT'S A ROUGH FART IT'S NOT PURE SCIENCE ALWAYS. BUT IS THERE I GUESS START WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IS WHAT ANY THINKING ABOUT GOAL SETTING IN THAT WAY EASIER WAYS TO SORT OF MEASURE PROGRESS OVER TIME ONE GOOD EXAMPLE IS THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY I SERVE ON THE COAST GUARD SERVANTS HE BOARD FOR THE THE SECRETARY AND THEY HAVE. A STRATEGIC PLAN WHERE THEY ACTUALLY MAY FOR THE FIVE YEARS AT A TIME TO FIGURE OUT OKAY HOW. HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE DO WE WANT TO GET ACCESS TO THE COAST -- HOW MUCH MORE LAND DO WE WANT TO PURCHASE? HOW MANY MORE PROJECTS ARE WE GONNA FUND THAT ACTUALLY GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS -- TO BEACHES TO THE COASTAL AREAS ON HOW MANY MILES A TRAIL THE COASTAL TRAILER WE GOING TO PRODUCE SO. THOSE METRICS REALLY HELP THEM AND HELP US AS A BOARD DECIDE WHERE WE WANT TO INVEST THE MONEY. AND SO DO YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE TO APPLY THAT SAME KIND OF SYSTEMATIC APPROACH MORE BROADLY AROUND THIS SORT OF RESILIENCY -- PUSH THAT SEEMS LIKE THE CENTRAL DRIVING. THEME MORE AT ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO TO IS IF THERE ARE STATEWIDE THEMES WE WORK WITH OUR GRANT PROGRAMS TO ACTUALLY INCLUDE THAT INFORMATION IN THEIR GUIDELINES. SO IT SPREAD ACROSS THE WHOLE AGENCY SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE. WE CAN DO THAT THROUGHOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. I I GUESS WHAT I'M I'M SORT OF GETTING THAT MAYBE IS EMILIO YOU CAN HELP JUST GIVE US SOME ADVICE ON ON GOING BASED ON IS. WE'RE GONNA SPEND ALL THIS THE BOND IN GENERAL FUND ANOTHER DOLLARS. ON TRY TO MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE RESILIENT MEANWHILE GOT A A MAJOR WILDFIRE LIABILITY ISSUE THAT WE'RE WRESTLING WITH IS A LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE REDUCE RISK RIGHT HAD THAT SORT OF REDUCE THAT COST IT'S GOING TO BE BORNE BY SOMEONE FROM. THESE CLIMATE CATASTROPHES. AND SO I THINK WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT. THE MARKET SORT OF LOOKING SAID OUR UTILITY SECTOR IN SAYING THAT THEY'RE LOOKING A VERY NARROW KIND OF RISK ANALYSIS IF WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. AND HAVE LESS RISK TO SAY HOMEOWNERS AT THE END OF THE LINE WHO. NOT NECESSARILY JUST FROM A PURE GREED PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM ALL THIS OTHER SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING ALL THIS THE REST IS LIKE HOW DO WE ACTUALLY. QUANTIFY RISK REDUCTION EARLY SET UP SOME SELF EVALUATION FRAMEWORK TO TO KIND OF IS THAT IS THAT TO ABSTRACT OR IS IT IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT POSSIBLE I I THINK IT IS AN IT IS NEW ARE THE WAY WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY DONE IT IS. THROUGH GRAY INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S PRETTY. STRAIGHTFORWARD WE WANT TO PROVIDE WATER FOR THE THE BILL THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT THAT'S GONNA PROVIDE WATER FOR THIS MANY PEOPLE. THE WAY THE STATE HAS TRADITIONALLY HELD GRANTEES ACCOUNTABLE FOR BOND PROJECTS IS OKAY IN YOUR APPLICATION YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO THIS PROJECT THAT CREATED. X. NUMBER OF ACRES OF WETLAND OKAY YOU CREATED X. NUMBER OF ACRES GREAT YOU'VE DONE YOUR JOB BUT THAT BUT THAT ISN'T GETTING IT KIND OF THIS NEXT LEVEL OF IS IT ACHIEVING THE GOALS WE WANTED BEYOND. THE CONCRETE MEASURES SO I THINK WHEN AGENCY THAT'S THAT'S REALLY BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS IS A SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY AND I THINK YOU'VE GOT THEM ON OF SUBSEQUENT PANEL THEY ARE WORKING ON DEVELOPING AT DASH BOARD OF RESILIENCE FOR SOME OF THEIR FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS THAT'S NOT JUST OKAY. WE REMOVED -- AT EXCESS VEGETATION AN EX NUMBER OF ACRES BUT WHAT DID THAT YIELD US WHAT ARE WE WHAT ARE WE ANTICIPATING IT'S GOING TO BE. FOR YOU KNOW WATER YIELD FROM THE FOREST AND WILDLIFE BENEFITS AND SO IT'S CERTAINLY MORE. CAN A SQUISHY THAN THAN SOME OF THE HARD. THE HARD. CONCRETE ANSWERS BUT ITHINK IT CAN BE GROUNDED IN SCIENCE AND AND IF IT IS THEN IT CAN BE MEANINGFUL SO THAT MAY BE -- IN A FUTURE AGENDA SOMETHING YOU WANT TO PURSUE AND AND HEAR ABOUT SOME OF THE METRICS THEY'RE USING AND SEE WHETHER THAT COULD BE USED ACROSS ACROSS GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION OF BEYOND. DID YOU DO WHAT WE YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA DO BUT DID YOU DO WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO. I THINK DE THE CHALLENGES HIS HOUSE AFFECTS THE COMMUNITY AT THE LARGER BECAUSE WE'VE GOT IN ON THE STREET. OF WETLAND INSTREAM REPAIR I MEAN WE COULD SPEND A TON OF MONEY ON THE DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED FROM JUST. HUMANS ACTIVITY OR THE PREVIOUS LUMBAR RAT ACTIVITIES OR THE RECENT STORMS AND WE LOOK IN AND WE SAY OKAY HOW DO WE REPAIR THOSE. WE DO DEAL FASHION WAY OR WE COULD TRY TO TO DO IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT THAT IT BENEFITS THE FOR THE FLOW OF WATER SO THE SENTIMENTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO NATURALLY FLOW OUT INTO THE DELTA OR TO THE BAY. IMPROPER OCCUR RIGHT TO HOW HOW WE USING THE BEST ENGINEERING NOT THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WAY BUT IN A IN A A RESILIENT HUESO WERE SAYING HOW DO WE INTERACT ANDY THAN DOING DAMAGE CORRECTION BUT ALSO IMPROVEMENT. BECAUSE OF THE OTHER THE OTHER BENEFITS THAT WOULD OCCUR TO THE YOU KNOW THE ECOSYSTEM IT AT LARGE AND THAT'S A BIGGER CHALLENGE. AND AND I THINK ONE PIECE TO ADD IS IF WE WANTED. TO PURSUE THIS IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE SOME MORE FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL YEARS OF MONITORING AND SEEING KIND OF DOING THE SCIENTIFIC FOLLOW UP ON HOW IS THE WETLAND PERFORMING IN IS IS IS IS THE WATER. FLOWING THROUGH OR IS IT GETTING SILTED UP AFTER FIVE YEARS YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE TYPES OF ONGOING. MONITORING AND AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT MAY HAPPEN AND THAT ISN'T TRADITIONALLY HOW WE HAVE. USED AT LEAST BOND FUNDING FOR PROJECTS THAT'S BEEN ONE PLOP AND AND WE'RE DONE SECTOR. ONE THING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE DID LAST YEAR WAS WE STARTED A UNIT AT THE AGENCY TO ACTUALLY. DO THIS TYPE OF THING TO DO MONITORING AND TO FIGURE OUT BEST PRACTICES I THINK YOU REMEMBER WAS PASSED LAST YEAR IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE. AND THEY'RE WORKING ON METRIC AT THE USE WERE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND THEY'LL BE SPREADING THAT INFORMATION ALL THROUGHOUT OUR DEPARTMENTS. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE GOT -- DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE IS ALSO. ARE WORKING WITH ALL THE FLOOD CONTROL AGENCIES AND ALL THE DIFFERENT LOCALITIES THAT ARE THERE AND YOU KNOW THE CONSERVANCY'S IS ALSO WERE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE MEAN WE WANT TO HAVE. I'M. DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT THE CALLS CONSERVANCY IS IS IS LOOKING AT THESE EXPAND EXPANSION VERSES YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF AGENCIES SIMPLY BY LAND IN THE WORD OF PRESERVATION BUT THEY'RE NOT. THE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MORE THING ELSE TO MANAGE IT OR TO DO ANYTHING AND WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT A MALL IN OUR DISTRICT AND ALL ALL IN THE REGION AND THAT HAS SORT OF BEEN THE THE MENTALITY IS THAT WE JUST GOT PROTECT. PROTECT IS A JUST CHOIR VERSES BECAUSE WE THINK SOME OTHER ACTIVITIES AGREE CONVERSES PROTECT AS A BE. A THE STEWARD OF THE PRICE OF THE PROPERTY AND NOT JUST HOLDING IT SO. HI THIS. ONE ONE FINAL POINT IN THE IN THE METRICS THAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING MR CASH MOST YEAR. IS RESILIENCY A PART OF THOSE METRICS WHEN YOU'RE DOING I BELIEVE IT IS GUIDELINES YOU ALL DEVELOPED PURSUANT TO THE BUDGET ACTION I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT IT IS ACTUALLY -- FOR FOR STAFF PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON TRACKING ALL THE BOND PROJECTS AND THEN. WORKING ON FIGURING OUT WHAT WHAT THE STATE ACTUALLY GOT FOR THEIR THEIR DOLLARS AND THEN WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES ENSURING THOSE THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT. OKAY WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT THANK GOD. LET'S CALL UP OUR LEARN MORE ABOUT THESE FALL TERRY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WE HAVE A DIRECTOR BONHAM AND I UNDERSTAND THE MISS MESSER FLIGHT WITH THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES WILL. HELP JOINT. SECRETARY CASH CASH. IF I COULD JUST ADD -- WE AGREE WITH THE LA DOES ASSESSMENT. AND WHAT THE MEMBERS OF SAID ABOUT PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION. AND WE HAVE A MEETING SET UP NEXT WEEK WITH THE LA -- WITH FINANCING WITH STAFF TAX IN THE FUTURE WHAT WE WANT THINGS TO LOOK LIKE HOW MUCH INFORMATION DO WE NEED TO PROVIDE BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED. THE PUBLIC NEEDS. TO TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES PERFECT FIRST THIRTY BOTTOM PLACE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME'S CHUCK BOND AMONG THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. STILL I THINK THE GREATEST JOB IN THE WORLD. AND I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE THIS ITEM AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE DEPUTY DIRECTOR MESSER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK. AS OUR LAST PIECE AND ANSWER THE STAFF QUESTIONS THAT APPEAR ON THE AGENDA I BELIEVE PAGE. FOURTEEN SO WHAT IS A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT. THERE ARE THREE THINGS I'D LIKE TO IMPRESS UPON. FIRST. WATER DEFINES CALIFORNIA. EITHER BECAUSE OF ITS SCARCITY OR BECAUSE OF ITS ABUNDANCE. WE HAVE FOUGHT ABOUT IT FOREVER. WE ARE LIKELY TO FIGHT ABOUT IT IN THE FUTURE HOLLYWOOD IS MADE MOVIES ABOUT THOSE FIGHTS SECOND. IF YOU CAN IMAGINE A MAP OF CALIFORNIA IN YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE WATERSHEDS IN RIVERS. ACROSS OUR GREAT STATE. AT THE SAME TIME IN ANY GIVEN DAY. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REGULATORY. ENDEAVORS OR PROCEEDINGS OR AUTHORITIES STATE AND FEDERAL. IN ANY GIVEN WATERSHED ABOUT THE USE OF WATER. THE MANAGEMENT OF LAND THE PROTECTION OF SPECIES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IN MOST THOSE WATERSHEDS. THEIR VIBRANT ENDEAVORS TO COLLABORATE. TO PRODUCE DURABLE RESULTS QUICKLY. WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY THIRD POINT. OUR PRIME MANAGER OF WATER IN CALIFORNIA OUR OUR COLLEAGUES AT OUR STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. THEY HAVE A STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITY. TO DEFINE WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES [inaudible] RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES. AS WELL AS THE SACRAMENTO RIVER IMAGINE READING DOWN TO HEAR. AND THE TRIBUTARIES TO IT AND THE DELTA. TO UPDATE THE WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES IMPORTANT WORK. THE IDEA OF A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT IS OUR TWO DEPARTMENTS WORKING WITH WATER USERS AND CONSERVATION GROUPS. CAN DESIGN A COLLABORATIVE PACKAGE. OF RESTORATION MEASURES. AND FLOW IMPROVEMENTS. AND BRING IT TO THE WATER BOARD THEY CAN OF VALUE WAITED TRANSPARENTLY. TO DETERMINE IF AS THE SCIENTIFIC AND LEGAL SUFFICIENCY. THE BECOME THE WAY WE ACHIEVE THOSE WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES. THAT'S THE IDEA. IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY -- LET ME TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO GIVE. THAT INSTITUTIONS VIEW ON THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH. THANK YOU DIRECTOR BONHAM AND GOOD MORNING -- FIRST OFF LET ME EXPRESS DIRECTOR NAME ITS REGRETS SHE WAS HERE EARLIER SHE HAD TO LEAVE SO I SHOOTING IN AND HOPEFULLY I'LL DO THIS LITTLE JUSTICE -- BUT TO JUST VERY QUICKLY FOLLOW UP ON THE DIRECTOR'S COMMENTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WE ARE VERY EAGER TO ENGAGE IN THIS VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS PROCESS. IS NOT ONLY DOES IT PROMISED BENEFITS FOR WATER SUPPLY BUT ALSO WATER QUALITY AND IT ALSO ENTAILS HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECTS THAT. HELP TO PROTECT OUR WATERSHEDS AND HELP TO CREATE. CONDITIONS THAT ARE BETTER FOR NATIVE FISH SPECIES SO FOR US IT'S KIND OF THE THE WHOLE PACKAGE IF YOU WILL -- OF BENEFITS THAT WE WE SEEM. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT. THROUGH THIS PROCESS THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF TRANSPARENCY THERE WILL BE A GREAT DEAL OF TRANSPARENCY AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR DEPARTMENT IT'S ONE OF OUR CORE VALUES IT'S IN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN. I THINK BY THE NATURE OF HOW THIS PROCESS WILL WORK WITH BROAD STAKEHOLDER. ENGAGEMENT IT LENDS ITSELF TO ALLOWING US. TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR VISIBILITY OF THE WORK THAT WE ARE INVOLVED IN OF THE BENEFITS OF THAT WORK AND THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE ENGAGE WITH. SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA TURN IT BACK OVER TO DIRECTOR BOTTOM SO HERE ARE OUR THOUGHTS ON THE QUESTIONS -- STAFF ASKS ON PAGE. FOURTEEN LET ME JUST ACKNOWLEDGE I UNDERSTAND IT'S A HOLD OPEN ITEM I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. I AGREE WITH THE LA -- REPORT THE THIS EXPENDITURES CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSITION. PROP SIXTY EIGHT ACTUALLY SETS ASIDE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THIS ENDEAVOR SO WHY SEVENTY MILLION AND NOT SEVENTY ONE OR SIXTY NINE I THINK SEVENTY IS A BEST PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT RELATED TO THE SCALE HERE'S THE SCALE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HABITAT RESTORATION INSTREAM FLOW IMPROVEMENTS. FROM BASICALLY MERCED. TO THE DELTA. THE TRIBUTARY OF THE TO WOLLEMI AND POTENTIALLY. THE STATE DOES STANISLAUS IN THE MERCED RIVER'S. THE DELTA PROPER. ALL OF THE SACRAMENTO FROM HERE ALMOST UP TO READING. AND THE TRIBUTARIES OF THE YUBA. THE AMERICAN RIVER THE FEATHER RIVER THE MCCALL IN THE RIVER -- I DON'T THINK I'VE LEFT ANY OUT. SO THE SCALE IS A MESS. AND IT MATCHES THE NEED. WHERE DIRE SITUATION WITH MANY OF OUR HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH SPECIES WE NEED TO GET INTO THE LANDSCAPE? AND TURN DARK YESTERDAY ONE FLOODPLAIN CONNECTION REMOVING FISH BARRIER -- PROBLEMS HE'S PUTTING GRAVEL AND CLEANING GRAVEL WE NEED TO BE DOING THAT YESTERDAY. SO WE THOUGHT ABOUT OUR MANAGEMENT OF OUR EXISTING RESTORATION PROGRAMS AND CONCLUDED SEVENTY MILLION WAS A BEST PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT AMOUNT. GIVEN THE BROADER TWO HUNDRED MILLION SET ASIDE IMPROPER. SIXTY EIGHT HOW WILL WE GO ABOUT SELECTING IN PRIORITIZING THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS. WE EXPECT. TO BE SUBMITTING TO THE STATE WATER BOARD OVER TIME. A SERIES OF DESCRIPTIVE PROPOSALS ABOUT POTENTIAL PROJECTS FOR INVESTMENT. OUR DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN RUNNING FOR MANY YEARS RESTORATION GRANTING PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW OUR SCIENTIST WORKING WITH EXTERNAL PARTIES. TO PRIVATIZE THE HIGHS RETURNS ON INVESTMENT -- I WOULD IMAGINE RESOURCE AGENCY WHICH IS THE BENEFICIARY OF THE FUNDS IN THE PROPOSITION WOULD BE CONSULTING WITH THE TWO DEPARTMENTS. AND THE COALITION OF STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. MOSTLY THE IDEA IS USING EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES SO IF YOU LOOK AT PROP SIXTY EIGHT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REALIZE IT'S POTENTIALLY. FEASIBLE TO USE PROPOSITION ONE FUNDS. REMAINING PROPOSITION THIRTEEN FUNDS WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD FUNDS TO ALIGN WITH THIS GLOBAL ENDEAVOR TO MAKE THIS LANDSCAPE SCALE CHANGE IN THE SACRAMENTO IN THE SAN JOAQUIN. I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE QUESTIONS AND I'LL SAY I THINK. THAT COVERS MANY OF THEM I WOULD IMAGINE THE FUNDS. I KNOW THE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT CONSISTENT WITH THE GUIDANCE THAT YOU FIND IN THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE. AS WELL AS SECTION SEVEN NINE SEVEN THREE TWO AND SEVEN NINE SEVEN THREE SIX OF THE WATER CODE. WHICH PRECISELY DEFINE THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE QUALIFIED IS ELIGIBLE FOR INVESTMENT. ALSO I THINK TELLS YOU THESE FUNDS CAN'T BE SPENT ON OTHER THINGS LIKE CONVEYANCE PROJECTS IN THE DELTA. IN REQUIRE ANNUAL REPORTING BY SECRETARY CROWFOOT BACK TO YOU ABOUT THE USE OF FUNDS. HERE'S MY CONCLUSION. CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA OF THE TOTAL COSTS IF YOU HAD IF WE HAD THE OPEN CHECKBOOK AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS BOND PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION WHAT ARE THE UNDER THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL. FOR APPLICATIONS OR COOPERATION THAT AND AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE TO BE SPENT SO WE I GUESS. I'M GET APPLES AND APPLES HERE YES [inaudible] THIS [inaudible] ENDEAVOR [inaudible] IS [inaudible] CONTINUING SO SOME OF THE NUMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO REFINEMENT. AS WE GO THROUGH THE DIALOGUE WITH THE COALITION AND OF COURSE ENGAGE WITH YOU. BUT AS A GENERAL MATTER -- ONE OF THE PRIME FEATURES OF A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT THAT'S REALLY ATTRACTIVE TO ME. IS THE WATER USERS INVOLVED ARE PROPOSING TO CHARGE THEMSELVES. IN GENERATE AS I UNDERSTAND IT ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FROM THEIR OWN CHARGES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE HABITAT RESTORATION INVESTMENT. THE INCREASE IN STREAM FLOW AND NEW SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMS TO MONITOR ALL THIS. SO OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. A IS WHAT WE'VE SUGGESTED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION FROM THAT SELF CHARGE. COMBINED WITH WE'VE. FIGURED OUT THE POTENTIAL OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY TWO MILLION PUBLIC FUNDS THAT ALREADY EXIST. WHICH COULD BE BROUGHT TO BEAR AND IF I MATHIS IS RIGHT THAT'S ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE ONE BILLION. AS A TOTAL EFFORT. ACROSS ALL THAT GEOGRAPHY. WE TO INCLUDING THIS TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S PROOF CORRECT AND THE SEVENTY PART OF WHAT GOD. SO HERE'S MY CONCLUDING REMARKS ANIMAL POTS FOR QUESTIONS. I'VE BEEN DOING. THIS WORK IN THE WEST MY ENTIRE CAREER -- FIRST IN THE NONPROFIT SPACE. AND NOW -- THE GREAT HONOR OF SERVING IN THIS BILL. I'VE NEVER RUN ACROSS MORE DIFFICULT [inaudible] PROJECT. THINK ABOUT THE CHARACTERS FROM READING TO MERCED IN. ALL OF OUR IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS -- THERE'S A LOT OF LEGITIMATE CONCERN ABOUT THIS ENDEAVOR YOU MAY HEAR PEOPLE CRITICIZE IT YOU MAY. HEAR PEOPLE SAY WERE DOUBLE COUNTING PROJECTS OR THIS IS ALL SMOKE AND MIRRORS. I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION IS SECRETARY CROWFOOT. AND SECRETARY BLUMENFELD A KELLY PA HAVE REALLY INSTRUCTED THE TWO DIRECTORS. TO MAKE THIS DISCUSSION FULLY TRANSPARENT. TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S LAYING OUT WHAT WE'RE UP. TO GOING FROM THE STATE WATER BOARD INTEGRATING STATE WATER BOARD INVOLVEMENT AND MAKING SURE EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE TO UNDERSTAND. AND OFFER CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. REALLY IMPORTANT MILESTONE LAST FRIDAY FORTY FOUR INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING SOME OF OUR KEY REGIONAL AND NATIONAL CONSERVATION GROUPS. AND WATER USERS SIGNED A JOINT LETTER SAYING THERE'S STILL MUCH MORE WORK TO DO. NONE OF THIS IS FINAL. BUT WE'RE WILLING TO KEEP AT IT BECAUSE THIS IS SO IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA. BUT ON THE DECEMBER TWELFTH MEETING THAT THEY LEFT IT OPEN THAT TO ADD MORE THINGS CORRECT -- COLLEAGUES CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH IS THAT YOUR TO JUST REAL QUICK LITTLE DEEPER -- THIS CINEMA COUNTY SPENDING TEN TO TWELVE MILLION A MILE IN TRACK BECAUSE JEOPARDY INTO ANOTHER WOULD BE DEBRIS IN DEEPER WATER. HABITAT EXEDRA. AND THAT'S JUST IN THAT SMALL CREEK. WITH THE COLD WATER SOURCE. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE SO. EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY TWO ALL IN CORRECT. THAT'S THE BUDGET WE PRESENTED IN TABLE FIVE INTO SUBMISSION WE MADE TO THE WATER BOARD LAST FRIDAY OKAY. AND THEN TALK ABOUT. THE NEED. FOR BECAUSE YOU STILL NEED THE THAT COLD WATER CORRECT TWO CAN YOU JUST. WALK US THROUGH THAT IS WELL WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE. IF YOU PUT IN THE WOODY DEBRIS THE GRAVEL THE DEEPER WATER HABITAT -- AUSTRIAN HABITAT CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THAT JUST YES. SO. I THINK THERE'S A COMPARISON THAT'S IMPORTANT HERE. AND IS A CONSTRUCTIVE. ONE IF YOU WERE TO JUST THINK ABOUT THIS CHALLENGE FROM THE AUTHORITIES AT THE STATE WATER BOARD [inaudible] IT. REALLY IS FOCUSED ON HOW TO PRODUCE STREAM FLOW. AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. IT DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY AS I UNDERSTAND IT TOO ALSO COMPEL HABITAT RESTORATION. THE FIXING OF THE LAND. THE IDEA OF THE THEORY BEHIND THE SETTLEMENTS IS. YOU CAN INTEGRATE THE TWO YOU CAN COMBINE VAST HABITAT RESTORATION WITH IMPROVE STREAM FLOWS. AND THE INTEGRATION. THROUGH A VOLUNTARY EFFORT. COULD PRODUCE BETTER RESULTS SO WHAT YOU SEE IN THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS ARE ALSO FLOW COMMITMENTS. FLOW COMMITMENTS FROM THE SENIOR WATER USERS IN THE TO WOLLEMI. IN THE LOWER SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. IN THE FEATHERED THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN THE AMERICAN THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION ON THE UNITED STATES FRONT -- VERY OLD SENIOR WATER RIGHT USERS IN THE SACRAMENTO SYSTEM EAST BAY MUD IN ALL THEIR VARIOUS DISTRICTS IN THEM CALLING ME -- OF VARIETY OF WATER USERS IN THE AMERICAN. OFFERING THEIR COMMITMENTS ON THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY WOULD MANAGE THEIR RESERVOIRS. THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY WOULD DIRECTLY FALLOW LAND. AND RETURN THAT WATER OTHERWISE USE FOR PRODUCTION INTO THE RIVER. SO THE SETTLEMENTS ALSO INCLUDE A SERIES OF COMMITMENTS FOR IMPROVING STREAM FLOW AND ACHIEVING TEMPERATURE OBJECTIVES LIFECYCLE NEEDS FOR SAM. IS IT ENOUGH. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT THIS COMING YEAR. AS WERE IN FRONT OF THE STATE WATER BOARD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SCIENTIFIC SUFFICIENCY -- THOSE KINDS OF MEASURES. I MET MY LAST QUICK QUESTION TO YOU YOU BELIEVE. DOING THE HABITAT ENHANCEMENT. YOU'LL BE ABLE. THEY HAVE A DECREASED INCREASE OF WATER. I AND ACCOMPLISH. THE SAME GOALS. I WOULDN'T. PUT THOSE WORDS IN MY MOUTH. I MEAN THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING I THINK. THAT THERE'S VALUE AND CONSIDERING THE INTEGRATION OF FLOW AND NON FLOW. MEASURES AS A GLOBAL PACKAGE. THEN I THINK. WE WILL NEED TO ANALYZE THAT TRANSPARENTLY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE WATER BOARD IN COMPARISON TO IF WE WERE JUST REGULATING THE FLOW ONLY ASPECT. AND THAT'S WHAT I EXPECT WILL HAPPEN IN THE COMING WEEKS OKAY. THANKS TO CARE FOR CASH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU -- GREATER BOTTOM. IT'S HARD YOU KNOW YES THIS YEAH. WE WE GET THAT -- APPRECIATE THE CREATIVITY I I GUESS MY QUESTIONS MORE TECHNICAL IN NATURE -- STRUCTURE SIXTY EIGHT AND TIMING ON THESE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS CAN YOU JUST WEIGH IN ON THAT HOW YOU'RE THINKING OF WHAT CAME INTO THE WALL -- WHAT GUIDANCE BEFORE WHAT IS IT JUNE LAST YEAR SUBSEQUENT? AND HOW THAT SORT OF LINES UP WITH. YOUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE ON DIFFERENT POTS WITHIN -- SIXTY EIGHT QUESTION SO. THERE WAS A LOT OF ACTIVITY LAST YEAR -- YOU MAY BE REFERRING TO THE TECHNICAL LANGUAGE AND PROP SIXTY EIGHT THAT ALSO HAS A DATE MILESTONE. COURSE RELATIVE TO THAT STATUTE. DATE MILESTONE THERE'S ALSO LANGUAGE AND PROP SIXTY EIGHT THAT REVERSE THE FUNDS EFFECTIVELY. TO THE AGENCY. TO THAT ALLOW THE AGENCY TO USE THE FUNDS FOR THE VERY SAME PURPOSES. TO FIND IN THE WATER CODE OR OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THE RIVER PARKWAY PROGRAM. THEN IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR -- MIDDLE OF THE MONTH. A FRAMEWORK WAS PRESENTED IN FROM THE STATE WATER BOARD ABOUT THIS ENDEAVOR. AGAIN NOT A COMPLETE WORK. AND THEN IN THE SHORT MONTHS OF JANUARY FEBRUARY AND TWO SECRETARIES AND A RENEWED INTEREST AND AN OPENING UP OF THE DIALOGUE FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS. WE'VE JUST MADE ANOTHER SUBMISSION TO THE STATE WATER BOARD LAST FRIDAY MARCH FIRST I THINK THAT WAS LAST FRIDAY. OUR NEXT MILESTONE LAID OUT IS TO BE BACK IN FRONT OF THE WATER BOARD BEGINNING OF THIS JUNE. WITH THE FINAL DETAILS SORTED OUT -- AND I THINK THAT'LL BE ANOTHER IMPORTANT MOMENT OF CLARITY. OF COURSE THIS BUDGET DISCUSSION WILL RUN THROUGH THAT PERIOD RIGHT. AND IN MY PERSONAL VIEW SEVENTY MILLION IS A FAIR DOWN PAYMENT ON NO REGRETS. WE NEED. TO FIX THIS LANDSCAPE WE NEED TO GO INVEST IN THESE PROJECTS -- END. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN MY VIEW HISTORICALLY? WE'VE RELIED ON CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS A WE'VE RELIED ON PROMISES TO DO THIS THAT OR THE OTHER. THERE BEEN LONG LAUNDRY LIST OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO. THE LIST OF JUST BEEN SITTING THERE. AND NOW WE'RE WORKING TO ASSEMBLE THE VERY PRIME LANDOWNERS. AND WATER USERS AND FORCED THE CONVERSATION INTO A COMMITMENT TO DO THINGS AND TO FIND TIME TERM. WHAT I'M NOT HEARING YOU SAY IS WE INTEND THIS SOMEHOW I MEAN THIS IS GOING BACK TO THE WATER POURED IN OTHER WORDS WE STILL HAVE THAT? THAT CHECK AND THAT COMPARISON AROUND. YEAH THIS APPROACH VERSUS WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING. YES NOT WHEN CERTAIN NOT PRE DECIDING THAT HERE YOU'RE SAYING REGARDLESS OF HOW THAT THAT SHAKES OUT [inaudible] THAT THIS REVERTED POT AS HE PUT IT -- IS IS SORT OF NO REGRETS SAID OF INVESTMENTS THAT THING SO. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS WORKS ONLY IF. THE EVENTUAL FINAL PACKAGE -- FITS WITHIN THE BOARD'S REGULATORY PURVIEW. AND MAKES SENSE FOR THEM IN THEIR WATER QUALITY PLAN OBJECTIVES. ALRIGHT WELL I OUT WILL GO GOOD WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU IN JUST LOOK AT THE THE REVERSION ISSUE WE WATCH ON STABLE FOOTING IF THIS IS THE GROUND WE'RE GONNA BE PURSUING. BUT WE'RE LEAVING THIS -- OPEN RIGHT THIS IS JUST A DISCUSSION AT ALL DISCUSSION ARE LEAVING EVERYTHING UP AND CUT MYSELF. THE SAILORS ON FROM THE LA L. YEAHIT JUST TOOK A FEW POINTS ON THIS -- THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY BIG PARITY WHAT OUR USERS AND AND WATER PRIORITIES. IT ALL OF THESE DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF THE LEGISLATIVE PURVIEW THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND THIS VOLUNTARY PROCESS SO. THROUGH THESE APPROPRIATIONS IS REALLY ONE OF THE AREA. PRIME WAYS YOU ALL HAVE THE ABILITY TO WEIGH IN AND ENSURE THAT -- THESE IMPORTANT POLICY DECISIONS ARE ARE. BEING CITED AND AND BEING PURSUED IN A WAY THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH AND THAT THESE PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT IN A WAY YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT -- SO. JUST MAKING THAT POINT THAT THE KIND OF THIS THIS IS YOUR ENTREE INTO INTO THESE DISCUSSIONS -- THE TIMING IS IS DIFFICULT BUT THIS IS THIS IS AB KIND OF IN THE FLUX RIGHT NOW JUST JUST FRIDAY AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED A LOT OF ADDITIONAL DETAIL CAME FORTH SO -- BEFORE YOU MOVE FORWARD ON THIS BUDGET. I THINK I THINK YOU WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BEFORE THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE A DECISION SO YOU MAY REQUEST THAT AND WANT TO KNOW HOW THINGS ARE PURSUING YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE SEVENTY MILLION WOULD BE SPENT IF THERE IS A LIST OF SPECIFIC NO. REGRETS PROJECTS YOU MAY WANT TO SEE THAT BEFORE YOU MAKE THE APPROPRIATION OR AT LEAST UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE DEFINITIVE CRITERIA THAT WILL BE USED FOR DECIDING THOSE -- AND THEN OBVIOUSLY EVEN IN THIS PER FOR YEARS TO APPROPRIATE FOR THESE TYPE OF THINGS. WHEN WE HAVE WE DO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING THE WATER BOARD UP NEXT SO [inaudible] ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. SECRETARY ANY FINAL THOUGHTS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU -- WILL. LEAVE THIS MATTER OPEN -- ON THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT AND NOW CONTINUE WITH DIRECTOR BOTTOM ON THE OTHER. OTHER OTHER THAN FIVE BE IS THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY BUT OKAY. THAT OF THE AGENCIES REQUESTING TWENTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT EIGHT MILLION AND ONE POSITION FOR THE TRAILS AND GREEN WAYS PROGRAM. IN THIS NEW COMPETITIVE PROGRAM -- WILL MAKE GREAT GRANTS FOR NON MOTORIZED TRAIL PROJECTS TO PROMOTE NEW. OR ALTERNATIVE ACCESS TO PARKS WATERWAYS OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL PURSUITS AND FORESTED OR OTHER NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS -- PROJECTS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO PROMOTE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AND TO CONNECT CALIFORNIANS WITH NATURE. AGENCY WILL WORK IN COOPERATION WITH STATE PARKS TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA RECREATIONAL TRAILS ACT. IN UP 225% OF THE FUNDS CAN BE SET ASIDE FOR PROJECTS THAT DEMONSTRATE INNOVATION. AND PROVIDE OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES TO DISADVANTAGED YOUTH -- DRAFT GUIDELINES FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS WILL BE RELEASED IN MID APRIL AND WE WILL HOLD THREE PUBLIC MEETINGS IN MAY FOR THIS PROGRAM. THE FINAL GUIDELINES AND SOLICITATION. HELLO MISS EHLERS JUSTICE MAKING THE POINT THAT THIS ISN'T A NEW PROGRAM THAT THE STATE IS RUNNING SO -- MAKING SURE YOU'RE FEELING COMFORTABLE WITH DETAIL OF EXACTLY HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT IN PRIORITIZED. COLLEAGUES WE'RE GONNA KEEP THIS MATTER OPEN. SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY LOVES GREEN WAYS IN TRAIL SELF. LET'S. DO OUR BEST LET'S GO ON TO ITEM. FIVE C. WHICH IS FIVE C. IS ALSO AGENCY -- MULTI BENEFITS STORM WATER PROJECTS AGENCY IS REQUESTING NINETY TWO POINT NINE NINE MILLION AND THREE POSITIONS TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. THIS COMPETITIVE PROGRAM WILL FUND A MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS IN URBANIZED AREAS -- TO DRESS FLOODING. PROJECTS CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE -- BUT AREN'T LIMITED TO STORMWATER CAPTURE AND REUSE RESTORATION OF URBAN WATERSHEDS. INCREASING PERMEABLE SERVICES -- TO HELP REDUCE FLOODING. AGENCY WILL BE USING THE EXPERTISE TO D. W. ARE IN THE WATER BOARD ON THIS PROGRAM AND TO HELP WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION THE PROGRAM DRAFT GUIDELINES WILL BE IN MID JUNE AND WE WILL HOLD THREE PUBLIC MEETINGS IN JULY -- THERE'S A TWENTY FIVE MINUTES PERCENT MATCH THAT'S REQUIRED FOR THIS PROGRAM AND LET'S HEAR FROM A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. I YEAH I THINK WE HAVE THE SAME QUESTION THAT SENATOR STERN RAISE ABOUT THIS HOW DOES THIS STORM WATER PROJECT. PROGRAM FIT IN WITH THE WATER BOARD STORM WATER PROGRAM FIT IN WITH THE TO BE OUR STORM WATER PROGRAM SO IT'S ENCOURAGING TO HEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AT IS WORKING TOGETHER AND THAT -- AND THAT ROOM AGENCIES BRINGING THEM THIS NEW PROGRAM AT RESOURCES AGENCIES SO THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING THE BOND BUT I THINK TO THE DEGREE WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING IN CONCERT TOGETHER SO WE DON'T END UP -- KIND OF DOUBLE FUNDING PROJECTS OR WORKING AT CROSS PURPOSES AND I PRESUME THAT RESOURCES I MEAN THIS IS A DIFFERENT PROGRAM BUT THE WHOLE SOLICITATION PROJECT ON STORM WATER AND AND A GRANDSON WE CAN PROBABLY GIVE OUT NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS. RIGHT JUST. THE AMOUNT A THAT AMOUNT OF DEMAND OUT THERE IS INCREDIBLE. WE FIND SOME OF THE PROJECTS LIKE THIS UNDER URBAN GREENING AND WE HAD. A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO GIVE OUT AND WE GOT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN APPLICATIONS. SO THERE'S DEFINITELY A DEMAND OUT THERE FOR THIS TYPE OF PROJECT. COLLEAGUES WILL KEEP THIS MATTER OPEN. CONTINUE OUR GOOD WORK. A LET'S MOVE ON TO THE S. GMA. FOR THIS ONE WILL HAVE A TERRON -- REVS YOU NEED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES THIS IS TWENTY EIGHT POINT FOUR POSITIONS AND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS REQUESTING. GOOD MORNING. THE MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE BEFORE YOU TODAY MY NAME IS TAREN RABBIT ZENI I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL INITIATIVES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE LEAD OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT FOR THE DEPARTMENT. THE COMMITTEE HAS PROVIDED THE DEPARTMENT WAS SEVERAL QUESTIONS RELATED TO THIS ITEM WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS PROVIDE A LITTLE -- CONTEXT AND THEN TRY TO HIT ON THOSE -- ANSWERS AND ALL IN ONE NARRATIVE I'LL TRY TO KEEP THIS BRIE THOUGH TOO I KNOW THERE'S A LOT ON THE AGENDA TODAY [inaudible] I'M. WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT -- IS A RECOGNITION THAT THE PASSAGE OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS. TOO MANY OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA WATER LINE OVER CENTURY. THE DEPARTMENT IS ONE OF SEVERAL ENTITIES INVOLVED IN SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS ACT -- THE CENTRAL TENET OF SIGMA IS IN FACT TO KEEP LOCAL A TO KEEP AUTHORITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- SO THE DEPARTMENT HAS A DUAL THE TORY ROLE AND A LOCAL ASSISTANCE ROLE I AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO GO INTO FURTHER EXPLANATION OF THOSE ROLES HERE TODAY -- STATE INTERVENTION COMES INTO PLAY THROUGH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WITH WHOM WE NEED TO COORDINATE -- IN TRYING TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE LOCALS AS THEY'RE PULLING TOGETHER THEIR REQUIREMENTS -- AS WE ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN CLIMATE CHANGE WAS DISCUSSED HERE TODAY -- THE IMPROVEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF THE STATE'S GROUNDWATER -- RESOURCES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL RESILIENCY SO SIGMA IS TRULY A MASSIVE SHIFT IT'S A CULTURE SHIFT. IT'S ALSO A CHANGE MANAGEMENT SHIFT SO -- THIS IS NOT ONLY A HEAVY LIFT FOR LOCAL AGENCIES BUT THE STATE IS DOING ITS BEST TO RIDE ALONG WITH THEM AND TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT THAT'S NECESSARY TO SEE THIS SHIFT -- BE SUCCESSFUL -- I WAS MENTIONING THAT WE HAVE DUAL ROLES -- IN -- IN THIS. WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS ACT -- THERE ARE -- WITH REGULATION OF STABLE MANAGEMENT. THE HIGH AND MEDIUM PRIORITY BASED SINCE OUR RESPONSIBLE FOR MEETING VERY AGGRESSIVE DEADLINES WITHIN THE ACT ITSELF. THEY ARE REQUIRED TO FORM GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES AND DEVELOP GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS BY JANUARY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE TWENTY ONE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS. AND FOR V. I. REMAINING OVER A HUNDRED BASINS THERE ARE -- THAT ARE HIGH IN MEDIUM THAT DEADLINE IS JANUARY THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO THE FORMATION OF GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES. FOR THESE ENTITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR PULLING TOGETHER THESE PLANS IN THAT TIME FRAME. THERE WAS A JUNE TWENTY SEVENTEEN DEADLINE AND THE LOCALS WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN MEETING WHAT WAS THE FIRST STATE INTERVENTION MILESTONE. AND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES WERE FORMED AND NOT -- DOES COVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE BASINS. THE STATE HAS OVER FIVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN BASIN SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT AS APPLIED TO ALL OF THOSE BASINS. BUT IT REALLY IS THESE OVER HUNDRED BASINS THAT QUALIFY AS HIGHER MEDIUM THAT HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MEET. THE PLANNING DEADLINES AND SO THOSE ARE THE FOCUS OF A LOT OF WHAT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING HERE YOU YOUR ATTENTION -- TO FOR A MENTIONING THAT THIS IS A CHANGE MANAGEMENT ONCE THOSE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES. CAME TO FRUITION -- PART OF THEIR AT LOCAL PLANNING IS DETERMINING HOW THEY'RE GOING TO APPROACH PLAN DEVELOPMENT. AND THEY ALTHOUGH -- WE HAVE A LOTOF GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES AND A PARTICULAR NUMBER OF BASINS. MORE PLANS CAN BE PROVIDED FOR ONE BASIN FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU HAVE -- A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DIFFERENT GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES JUST IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ALONE AND THERE ARE FIFTEEN BASINS FOR THAT AREA -- THOSE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES ARE PLANNING TO DO MULTIPLE PLANS FOR EACH OF THOSE BASINS SO AS THEY'RE MAKING THAT DETERMINATION WE THE DEPARTMENT HAVE TO REMAIN SOMEWHAT NIMBLE AND FLEXIBLE -- TO BE PREPARED TO RECEIVE THAT ON SLIDE OF PLANS SO WE HAVE -- LEARNED. RECENTLY THAT THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS -- WILL DELIVER TO THE DEPARTMENT UPWARDS OF OVER FORTY PLANS BY THE JANUARY THIRTY FIRST DEADLINE OF TWENTY TWENTY AND WE AS A OF THE DEPARTMENT ARE RESPONSIBLE UNDER THE STATUTE TO REVIEW THOSE PLANS IN A TWO YEAR TIME PERIOD. IN ADDITION -- AGAIN WITH THE OVER -- HUNDRED BASINS SKEWS ME OVER THE HUNDRED BASINS HIGH MEDIUM BASINS THAT HAVE TO MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE WE COULD E RECEIVING PLANS AT ANY POINT FROM TWENTY TWENTY TWO ON POSSIBLY EVEN AS EARLY AS SOMETIME MID THIS YEAR. HI SO WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE UPWARDS OF COMING THREE YEARS. NOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO MEET ALL OF ITS STATUTORY DELIVERABLES TO DATE A LOT OF THAT IS DUE TO THE STAGGERED TIME FRAME FOR THOSE DELIVERABLES. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE PLAN REVIEW WHICH IS A VERY CRITICAL CRITICAL COMPONENT FORCING THE IMPLEMENTATION. IT WILL BE ESSENTIAL THAT WE HAVE THE WORK FORCE AVAILABLE TO REVIEW ALL OF THOSE PLANS IN A TIMELY MANNER. BUT AS I MENTIONED WE ALSO HAVE A VERY ROBUST LOCAL ASSISTANCE ROLL THIS IS A PART OF THE SIGMA. EFFORT THIS WAS WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD INTENDED AND IT IS A COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE ASSISTANCE NOT ONLY THROUGH. PROVIDING DATA SETS AND TOOLS BUT ALSO FUNDING I IN GRANT FUNDING SO THIS IS AGAIN WHERE PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT COMES INTO PLAY. SO OUR OUR CONCERN AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND TRY TO MANAGE THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS VERY VERY NEW MASSIVE PROGRAM. IS TO ENSURE THAT WHILE WE ARE MANAGING OUR REGULATORY ROLE IN DOING THAT EVALUATION WE ARE NOT SACRIFICING THE ASSISTANCE ROLE AS WELL. SO BECAUSE THERE'S CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS AND WORKING AT A DIFFERENT TIME FRAME. IN A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER BASINS THAT ARE WORKING WITH THEIR TIME FRAME. THE ASSISTANCE IN THE REGULATION ALL HAVE TO HAPPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY OR CONCURRENTLY AND THEREFORE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO ONE POOL FROM ONE SIDE. TO THE OTHER IN TERMS OF OF THOSE DELIVERABLES -- SO WITH THE REQUESTED TIONS ARE SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THE STAFF'S STAFF SHORTAGE -- VISIT AGAIN IS TO MEET ALL OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS BUT LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THOSE THOSE ROLES THAT WE HAVE AND WHO DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION. IS I THINK THERE'S NINE FOR THIS EXPECTED GROWTH BUT THERE'S NINETEEN FOR OUR OTHER STAFF POSITIONS I GUESS. I WOULD I WANT YOU TO CONTINUE BUT IF WE HAVE IT'S A DUMB QUESTIONS I LIKE ASK CONSENT IF WE HAVE A HUNDRED BASIS. AND WE AND WE'VE WE'VE GOT SIGMAN WORSE WE WE REQUIRE PEOPLE TO PUT TOGETHER -- THESE GROUND WATER AGENCIES WHY DIDN'T WE JUST GET A HUNDRED AGENCIES BECAUSE IF IF WE WANTED TO HAVE A COORDINATED EFFORT I I SEE THAT THERE'S THERE'S DIFFERENT YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A CRAZY WORLD OUT THERE IN THE WORLD OF WATER BUT IF WE WE GOT THE WATERSHEDS. YOU KNOW WHEN OUR GRANDPA PAAS SET UP THE WATER AGENCY THEY JUST SORT OF SAID THIS IS MY THIS IS AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IN THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA DO WAS THE WAS THE R. H. YOUR RESOURCE AGENCY. HELPING WERE COORDINATING BECAUSE WE GET GIVE SIX SPOTS LAST YEAR WHEN THEY CAME UP WITH THIS CAN WE HAVE PEOPLE LOOK AT HERE'S THE WATERSHED HERE'S THE BASE AND WE'RE ALL HERE ON ONE BASIN. OF OVER AS WITHDRAWING FROM IT AND YOU WERE -- A GROUND WATER AGENCY THAT WAS ONE THAT WAS A COORDINATED MADE UP FOR THESE PROGRAMS OR WE COULD HAVE -- DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN WOULD HAVING DIFFERENT FIGHTS NOW WITHIN THE GROUNDWATER AGENCY OVER -- THE ATTACHED COMMUNICATIONS BASED ON WHAT PEOPLE THINK IS THERE. ARE PRIMARY -- CHALLENGE. HE CAN HELP ME OUT WITH THAT BECAUSE IT WAS BUGGING ME. ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I WILL DO MY BEST TO HAVE A VERY SUCCINCT ANSWER FOR YOU BUT IT IS A COMPLEX QUESTION -- WITH THE WITH AN ELABORATE ANSWERS SO SAYS -- AS BEST I CAN. GOING BACK TO THE ENABLING LEGISLATION GOING BACK TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT. OF COURSE THERE WERE A LOT OF INTERESTS NOT ONLY WAS ON THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH INVOLVED THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH WAS INVOLVED BUT LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS. AND WATER AGENCY COMMUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE. THIS IS THE MAIN TENANT OF SIGMA OF KEEPING GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IS WHERE WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE GEOLOGY OF THOSE BASINS. THE LOCAL AUTHORITY IS -- WAS SUPPORTED BY SIGNUP BECAUSE OF THAT COMPLEXITY THE LOCALS KNOW IT BEST. BUT AS WE KNOW WATER ISSUES HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN QUITE CONTENTIOUS AND DIVERSIFY BUT SO IN ORDER FOR THE LOCALS TO KEEP. THEIR AUTHORITY UNDER SIGMA WITH THIS MAIN POLICY SHIFT FOR COMING FROM THE STATE. THAT WE NEED TO SUSTAINABLY MANAGED THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN GROUND WATER BASINS IN THE STATE. IT IS REALLY PUT ON THE LOCALS. I IF THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN NOT AUTHORITY THEY NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND DETERMINE HOW TO GOVERN THEMSELVES. NOW UNDER SIGMA AND THROUGH THE REGULATIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT DID PASS -- IN MAY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE -- GUIDEPOSTS FOR A THE NEED FOR COORDINATION AGREEMENTS. AND WORKING AT THAT LOCAL LEVEL EACH PLAN DOES HAVE TO WORK WITH FEE. DECENT BASINS AND AND CONNECTING PLANS SO THERE IS A COORDINATION COMPONENT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SIGMA. IN THIS IS FOR HAVING NEW HIRES IF THEY COULD -- REALLY WORK WITH THE VARIOUS AGENCIES TO HAVE ONE COORDINATED PLAN IT MAY HAVE DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATION. DATES BASED ON WHEN THE LOCAL -- PORTION OF IT IS IS -- IS APPROVED BUT WOULD LIKE TO SEE RATHER THAN MAKING YOU KNOW TWELVE GAZILLION PLANS COME UP IS THAT DIFFERENT RESOURCE AGENTS YOU KNOW. THAT GAME STATE SIT DOWN BEFORE AT THE AT THE BEGINNING AND LISTS THIS IS GOING TO BE THE COORDINATOR PLAN BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL HERE ON THE SAME BASIS. I KNOW THAT'S OF OVERSIMPLIFICATION WELL AND I I I THINK IT DOES SOUND LIKE AN AN EXCELLENT IDEA -- WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE IN THIS -- WE ARE REALLY SUBJECT -- TO WHAT WERE THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE CREATED BY THE DEPARTMENT APPROVED BY THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION. OF COURSE IN LINE MEN WITH THE WITH THE STATUTORY REGULATIONS. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TO HAVE MULTIPLE BROWN WATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES PER BASIN AND THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO MULTIPLE PLANS FOR THAT BASIN SO. UNLESS THERE REALLY IS A SHIFT IN THAT LEGISLATION I THINK WE ARE -- IN ORDER TO REACH WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING WE CAN HAVE CONTINUED SUPPORT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH OUR REGIONAL OFFICES TRYING TO HELP. THESE ENTITIES STREAMLINED THEIR DELIVERABLES BUT AGAIN THIS IS REALLY A UPON THEM THE LOCALS TO DO THIS THEMSELVES AND ONE OF THE REASONS AGAIN WHY WERE HERE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS IS THAT WE ARE LEARNING. THAT -- AN EFFORT TO HAVE SIMPLY ONE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN PUT TOGETHER BY MULTIPLE GSA'S SOME OF THOSE ARE BEGINNING TO CRUMBLE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS DESPITE. EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THEM WITH FACILITATORS FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT IS SPENT OVER TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. IN FACILITATION SUPPORT SERVICES IN THOSE REGIONAL AREAS IN THOSE BASINS -- BUT WE ARE LEARNING THAT WE ARE EXPECTING MORE PLANS COMING IN AND AS A RESULT HAVE TO BE ABLE. TO CONTINUE THE ASSISTANCE WELL BEING ABLE TO REVIEW THEM. JOHN I'M. YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU HAVE A FEELING SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU VOTE FOR TAPPED THE WATER AND WE WANT YOU TO GET IN SUSTAINABILITY PLAN AND YOU'RE UNABLE TO COME TOGETHER WITH YOUR YOUR NEIGHBORS ON HOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN. MY PATIENCE IS BEING IT BEING CHALLENGED YOU KNOW BECAUSE IF YOU'VE ALREADY FOR IF YOU FAIL THE SYSTEM AND WE DON'T DO ENOUGH ON CONSOLIDATION WE DON'T DO ENOUGH ABOUT. ABOUT LOOKING USING THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PERCEPTION OF OUR PERSPECTIVE OF OF HOW WE'RE ALL WORKING TOGETHER BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THESE LEGACY. AGENCIES THAT NEVER WORK PUT IN THE BASIN PLAN THEY'RE GETTING THAT. USE UP OUR STAFF BUT PLEASE CONTINUE WITH. YOUR ROOM YOUR PREPARED REMARKS. WELL THANK YOU -- SUIT JUST TO ELABORATE ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ADDITIONAL STAFFING TO HELP US -- POSTER THAT THE EVALUATION ROLE OF THE PLANS THAT WE ANTICIPATE COMING IN -- WE WILL HAVE TO EVALUATE AND PREPARE ASSESSMENT OF EACH OF THE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS AS MENTIONED WITHIN A TWO YEAR. TIME FRAME WE ALSO A DO REQUIRE THAT -- SUBMITTALS -- HAVE ALTERNATIVE PLANS SO HE'S BEING -- ANNUAL REPORTS TO THOSE PLANS SO ONCE THE PLANS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT. ANNUAL. REPORTS ARE REQUIRED TO THE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS SO ALL OF THIS COMES IN NOT ONLY IS THERE AGAIN THAT REGULATORY EVALUATION OF THE FIRST PLAN. BUT THE ANNUAL REPORTING WORKING WITH THE LOCALS WORKING WITH THOSE SUBMITTING AGENCIES AND THEN THERE EVALUATION AT A FIVE YEAR FOR FIVE YEAR UPDATES AND THIS IS A TWENTY YEAR PLANNING HORIZON. THE EXPECTATION THROUGH CIGNA WAS TO REACH THE SCENE ABILITY WITHIN A TWENTY YEAR TIME FRAME SO THAT'S TWENTY FORTY FOR THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR THE HIGH AND MEDIUM -- BASINS. I'M ADDITIONALLY DUE TO THE REGULATORY NATURE THESE ACTIVITIES MUST BE DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT. AND AGAIN AS I SAID WE DO NOT WANT TO SACRIFICE ANY OF OUR LOCAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS -- AND SO WE WILL CONTINUE SUPPORTING OUR TECHNICAL PLANNING AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AS REQUIRED. A WITHOUT THE NINE NEW POSITIONS THAT WE ARE ASKING AGAIN THERE WILL BE IMPACTS TO THOSE EFFORTS -- SO I IT IS ALSO A DISH I AM VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE A CHOIR HIDE TECHNICAL STAFF NOW THERE IS A LOT OF TRAINING THAT IS REQUIRED -- AND THEREFORE -- THE SOONER OF COURSE THAT WE CAN GET THAT STAFF THE BETTER -- WE WILL THERE WILL BE QUITE A BIT TO DO SO HITTING THE GROUND RUNNING -- MAYBE A LITTLE CHALLENGING SO WE DO NEED TO BUILD UP SOME TRAINING CAPACITY. HOW WILL YOU PRIORITIZE THESE GRANT PROGRAMS I MEAN YOU'VE GOT IT ALL? TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN GROUNDWATER -- AGENCIES IT'S JUST BEEN FORM THEY'RE ALL GOING TO COME IN IT'S ONLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT IF THAT'S THAT. THAT -- IN THERE'S GOT WE'VE GOT THE CRITICALLY -- THE PLEADED AREAS FIRST AS THE OTHERS AND SOME. I WOULD IMAGINE ALL THESE AGENCIES HAVE A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF EXPERTISE IN ELSE SOMETIMES WE REWARD THE FIRST ONE THAT COMES IN THE DOOR FIRST IS THE THE ONE THAT CAN'T GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER. IS THE ONE WE REALLY WOULD HAVE TO NEED A COORDINATED SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE PRIORITIZING. THEY GET THE GRANT SEND THE CRITERIA. SO ONE THING AND THAT IS A COMMITMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF COURSE TO SEE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS IS OF COURSE OF A FOCUS ON THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS. A WE WE DO RECOGNIZE WITHOUT IT TO MEET THESE AGGRESSIVE DEADLINES IN THERE. FOR THE STATE IS TAKING ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP THEM ALONG. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS A STRONG FOCUS AND COMMITMENT -- TO SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITHIN WITHIN THESE GRANT PROGRAMS -- UNDER THE IMPLEMENTATION GRANT -- PROGRAM THE REQUEST THAT WE'RE MAKING HERE TODAY. IMPLEMENTATION UNDER SICK MAMA IS REQUIRED UPON THE MIDDLE OF THE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN SO -- THE SUBMITTING AGENCIES DO NOT HAVE TIME TO SIT AND WAIT TO SEE IF WE APPROVE IT OR NOT. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR STARTING TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PROJECTS IN ACTIONS THAT WILL HELP BRING THEIR BASINS INTO -- SUSTAINABILITY SO THEY HAVE THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES WE NEED TO HELP SHEPHERD THAT ALONG THROUGH THESE THAT THESE THE IMPLEMENTATION GRANT PROGRAM SO WE HAVE -- BEN PROVIDING GRANT FUNDING FOR PLANNING. AND IF I CAN JUST PROVIDE A LITTLE A BACKGROUND PROPOSITION ONE WE WERE ABLE TO RELEASE OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION WENT TO IN MAY OF TWO IN THEN A TEAM WE RELEASED EIGHTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. TO SEVENTY EIGHT APPLICANTS OVER SIXTEEN MILLION OF THOSE WENT TO SEVERELY SAYS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- ADDITIONALLY WE ANTICIPATE THROUGH PROP SIXTY EIGHT FUNDS TO CONTINUE THE PLANNING GRANT PROGRAM WE'RE LOOKING AT THE REQUEST OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT. BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLANS THAT ARE COMING TO US IN THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT. DEALERS THEY ALEJO'S I THINK WE WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE EXACTLY YOUR QUESTION THIS IS CLEARLY AN INCREDIBLY HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE STATE AND DIFFICULT FOR LOCALS THEY REALLY NEED STATE SUPPORT AND FUNDING. TO DO THESE PROJECTS AND THEN IMPLEMENT SO HOW HOW WILL FUNDING BE IMPLEMENTED SINCE THIS AT EXCUSE ME HOW WILL FUNDING BE PRIORITIZED SINCE THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM WITH. THAT PRESUMABLY A LOT MORE NEED AND DEMAND THAN THERE IS FUNDING SO I THINK THAT PRIME. PRIME TARGET FOR CONTINUED LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. ANYTHING SERVICE SECTOR. THANK YOU WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND LOOK FOR CHART DISCUSSIONS. THANK YOU -- LET'S GO DO IT. ISSUE FIVE HE THIS IS -- STORM WATER MUDSLIDES AND FLASH FLOODS. FLASH FLOOD PROTECTION. A FUNDING LEVEL MORE FLASH FLOODS YES. MORNING CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAMES ARE CO COME THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT AND DAM SAFETY WITH TE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES -- I THINK THE GENDER DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF LAYING OUT AT LEAST -- AT THE LEVEL OF DETAIL WHAT WE'RE PLANNING ON DOING BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL. THE REQUESTED -- FUNDS WILL BE USED TO BOLSTER THE DEPARTMENTS FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FIVE POINT THREE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATE OPERATIONS. AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR LOCAL SYSTEMS. LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED TWO MILLION PROGRAM. IT BUILDS ON EXISTING DEPARTMENT OF PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE LOCAL LEVY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM COASTAL FLOODING PROGRAM IN PREVIOUS STUDIES CONDUCTED IN LOUISVILLE FAN AREAS JUST TO NAME A FEW. IT IS IN THE DEPARTMENT WILL EXPAND ITS ROLE IN POST FIRE WATERSHED ASSESSMENTS TO SUPPORT LOCAL AGENCIES IN PLANNING FOR MITIGATING FLOODED A BRIEF FLOWS. THIS BOLSTERED PROGRAM SEEKS TO MODERNIZE DEPARTMENTS WILL PLAY MANAGER PROGRAM. TO READ TO INCREASE FLOOD AWARENESS AND REDUCE CHRIS FROM THE UPPER WATERSHEDS THROUGH THE DAMS AND INTO THE FOUR PLATES. WHERE DO THIS BY PROVIDING DATA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER TOOLS TO ENSURE THAT STATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES? HAVE THE INFORMATION AND THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO INFORM RESIDENTS AND POLICYMAKERS ABOUT THE REGION'S RIVER FLOOD RISK AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. WE'RE GONNA PROVE THE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE REGULATORY DAM SAFETY PROGRAMS AND THE DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONAL FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. THE BILL ON OUR EXISTING PRODUCT PARTNERSHIPS WITH STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO INCREASE COORDINATION ALIGNMENT AND ACTIVITY. M. OPERATE AND MAINTAIN DIRECT AND REMOTE WEATHER MONITORING NETWORKS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WE HOPE TO YOU KNOW BY DOING THIS WILL VANCE THE ALIGNMENT OF ACTIVITIES TO SERVE -- PUBLIC SAFETY THREE BROADER WATERSHED PERSPECTIVE. LET'S REALLY ALL I HAVE I MEAN THERE'S THIS LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION IN THE AGENDA AS WELL ABOUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THE GRANT FUNDING. BANDAGES. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE FLOODING AND CLIMATE CHANGE THE CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS RATHER IS PROBABLY. HELP YOU OUT WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY AND SAYS I KNOW THIS IS PROP SIXTY FUND BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE SIZE OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE THAT WE HAVE HERE. IN AS THE CHANGE IT LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE DROP IN THE BUCKET. BUT THAT'S IT HELLO MOST OF THE FLOOD FUNDING THAT THE STATE SPENDS IS ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL BECAUSE WE HAVE PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY IN THOSE AREAS THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT. IS OUTSIDE OF THAT BIT ACTUALLY FOCUSES ON OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE AND AS SUCH I THINK WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST FROM AT CONSTITUENTS AROUND THE STATE BECAUSE OF THEIR IS LIMITED FUND STATE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR OTHER AREAS OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO -- AS A RESULT THE DETAILS OF EXACTLY HOW THIS FUNDING WILL BE SPENT PRIORITIZED ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT AND NOT A TON PROVIDED AS AS CONSISTENT WITH EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT PROP SIXTY I KNOW I DID THE GOVERNOR'S -- GOVERNOR BROWN'S CLIMATE. CHANGE CONFERENCE LAST SEPTEMBER I ATTENDED THAT RESILIENCY BY DESIGN A BAY AREA GROUP THAT HAD SEVEN OR EIGHT DIFFERENT PROJECTS NO LIFTING. HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN SO THAT THE AREA CAN FLOOD OVER ALAMEDA CREEK REALIGNMENT I MEAN IT WAS YOU KNOW. TWO HUNDRED MILLION THIS FROM BILLION HERE FIFTY MILLION HERE WAS THERE THE THIS IS SEED MONEY. REALLY SEED MONEY QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES. WE'RE GONNA HOLD IT. THANK YOU LET'S MOVE ON TO URBAN STREAMS RESTORATION PROGRAMS ANOTHER. OVER SUBSCRIBER BOB [inaudible] PROGRAM. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND CHRISTOPHER TURN NOW -- DEBBIE DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES FOR INTEGRATED WATERSHED MANAGEMENT A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS MORNING. AND THE TALK WITH YOU ABOUT OUR OUR BUDGET NEEDS. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE URBAN STREAMS RESTORATION PROGRAM SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOR THE PROGRAM -- IN BRIEF HAS DELIVERED AROUND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SUCCESSFULLY TO OVER THREE HUNDRED PROJECTS. AND GETTING A LITTLE BIT BACK TO SOME OF THE THE COMING BASICALLY SENATOR STERN. AND YOU MISTER CHAIR -- HOT ALL THESE PROGRAMS FIT TOGETHER IF YOU THINK ABOUT -- OVER THIRTY YEAR OLD PROGRAM IT'S BEEN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ON THREE HUNDRED PROJECTS YOU GET KIND OF THE POINT OF THIS PARTICULAR ONE AND A LITTLE BIT TO THE PUZZLE OF HOW THEY FIT TOGETHER. THIS PROJECT WITH THIS PROGRAM RATHER IS REALLY FOCUSED ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED WITH -- WITH PARKS PROJECTS WITH ACCESS TO THEIR WATER WAYS WITH RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WITH HABITAT RESTORATION AGAIN FOCUS IN THESE URBAN AREAS AND WHEN A PARTICULAR FOCUSES OF THIS PROGRAM IS REFLECTED IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST. IS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THESE ARE SOME OF THE HARDEST FOUGHT MOST IMPORTANT DOLLARS WHICH ACTUALLY GETS BACK TO YOUR PREVIOUS COMMENTS IF I CAN. CAN ALSO REFERENCE THOSE MISTER CHAIR. AND THAT IS WHAT REALLY IS THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN ALL OF THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAVING WHEN THE RELATIVE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT WE INFUSE. IS [inaudible] PLEASE TRADITIONALLY. VERY SMALL COMPARED TO WHAT LOCAL AGENCIES PUT INTO THESE EFFORTS WHETHER IT'S GROUNDWATER GROUNDWATER WHETHER IT'S STORM WATER WHETHER IT'S FLOODING THE CENTRAL VALLEY ETCETERA. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE MAKE THE BEST USE OUT OF THE LIMITED STATE FUNDS WE HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT HAPPEN. BUT FOR THE PRESENCE OF THESE BOND DOLLARS WHAT IS THAT ADDITIONAL VALUE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING I SEE THIS PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR HELPING TO PROVIDE ITS THIS THESE LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NOT JUST FOR THE NOT JUST FOR THE PROJECTS THEMSELVES BUT ALSO TO HELP. THEM BUILD LOCAL CAPACITY OF LOCAL LOCAL TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ARE YOU LEVERAGE -- THE EXPERTISE THAT IGNORE THAT -- RESIDES HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT -- PROGRAM IS ALL ABOUT IT'S REALLY FILLING THOSE CRITICAL GAPS AM IN HOPES OF BEING ABLE TO LEVERAGE THESE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES BY THE STATE OR LOCAL -- ON SIMILAR EFFORTS SO WITHOUT A LEAVE IT THERE AND I HAVE -- THE SOME STAFF FROM THE DEPARTMENT MARK MANDATORY HERE IF THERE'S ANY MORE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROGRAM THANK YOU WITH US SOME OF THE SCIENCE BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE URBAN STREAMS OF FOR LACK OF BETTER CHARACTER. RECESSION HAVE JUST BEEN NEGLECTED IN A THIRD STAGE AND JUST BEEN ECLECTIC AND TRYING TO RESTORE THE HEALTH OF THEM I MEAN YOU WE WILL OBVIOUSLY ONE HAVE. THAT THE PEOPLE OF GOD GOOD AND BAD BUT THE YOU KNOW SILT ACCUMULATION -- MANAGEMENT HAVE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE DAY. CUTTING EDGE TECHNICAL OR SCIENTIFIC. CHANGES OR WILL ANY OF THOSE IDEAS BE IMPLEMENTED WITH THESE WITH THESE PROPOSALS MEAN I GUESS YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE THE THE GRANT PROPOSALS BUT ARE WE LEARNING TO MANAGER STREAMS. BETTER OR WE JUST SORT OF DOING THINGS THE OLD FASHION WAY THAT CAUSES THE NEED IS SO OVERWHELMING I GUESS THREE QUESTION I'M GOING TO SAY YES. AND THEN PASS IT OFF. GOOD MORNING -- MARK MANDATORY DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES -- WITH YOUR LEARNED A LOT OVER. THIRTY FOUR YEARS WITH THE PROGRAM -- AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS GOING BACK TO SIMPLICITY OPENING UP. STREAMS WHERE WE CAN -- AND AND BALANCING THAT WITH REDUCING -- OF RISK OF FLOOD SAMPLE -- A REALLY GOOD PROJECT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE ARE GIVING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- TO IS A PROJECT IN SOUTH SACRAMENTO RIGHT NOW MORRISON CREEK WHERE -- IT'S A CULVERT IZED -- CREEK AND IT AT ITS ADJACENT TO A LOT OF REALLY STRATEGIC ASSETS COMMUNITY CENTER. SCHOOL -- ANOTHER MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THAT PROJECT OPENING UP ACCESS TO THE STREAM IS THAT REALLY A BIG VISION OF THE PROGRAM. AND IT IN LINE WITH PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT IT TO THE DISADVANTAGE -- COMMUNITY AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY SO -- WE'VE INVESTED THREE YEARS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THAT PROGRAM. FROM OUR URBAN STREAMS PROGRAM TO THAT -- PROJECT AND HAVING THAT COMMUNITY GIVE US A VISION OF WHAT THEY SEE IS AND URBAN STREAMS PROJECT IS. IS WONDERFUL TO PAVE THE WAY -- FOR SIXTY EIGHT WE HAVE TO GIVE OUT AT A MINIMUM OF 20% AND THE PROGRAM TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO -- WE'VE LEARNED A LOT AND THE YEARS OF OPENING UP AND MAKING THINGS MORE SIMPLE GETTING ACCESS -- TO THESE -- GREEN AND WATER FEATURES IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEN YOU'RE CONNECTED TO SO MANY OTHER ASSETS EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR SCHOOLS. FOR THE OLD THINKING WAS THAT YOU JUST PUT A CALL FOR DâN LAY SOME SMACK Là AND THEN YOU YOU GET THE FLOOD PROTECTION AND AND AND NOBODY'S IN HARM'S WAY AND AND THE SCIENCES THAT WE'RE LEARNING THAT. THE BY OPENING UP THE STREAMS YOU CAN A YOU HAVE THAT THE NATURAL -- THE WATER TABLE CAN ABSORB WHATEVER AS FLASH FLOODING WILL COMMAND BUT THAT THE AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BED AND THE SIDE BANKS CAN BE DONE IN SUCH A WAY EITHER AT THAT SPOT EARLIER ON YOU LOOK AT A WHOLE. HEALTH THE RIVER. CORRECT YEAH THAT THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT THE PROGRAM'S LEARNED AND APPLIED OVER THE YEARS IS IS JUST THAT IS. AND THEN YOU'RE LIMITED ON SPACE THESE ARE TIGHT URBAN SPACES AND YOU KNOW AGAIN WITH THE THEME OF SIXTY EIGHT IS IS LET'S GET MORE INCLUSIVE LET'S BRING MORE PEOPLE. TO SEE THIS GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND OUR PROGRAM -- WHAT WITH THE MODEST AMOUNT -- PROP SIXTY EIGHT AS TEN MILLION DOLLAR. WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY WHERE WE'RE SPENDING A A SMALL PROCREATION FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS YEAR AND AS MATTER FACT AS WE SPEAK THERE IS A PUBLIC WORKSHOP IN AND GLENDALE. ON THE PROGRAM AND THE GRANT SO -- WHY HAVE STAFF IT DOWN THERE TODAY AND AND? THE PUBLIC INTERACTING WITH THEM IN ASKING ABOUT THE GUIDELINES THE GUIDELINES ARE OUT -- SO WHERE DECIDED YET THAT BONUS OF HAVING -- A SCHOOL THERE BECAUSE THEN THE YOU CAN -- YEAH THAT JUST THAT JUST TO GET SOME KIDS OUT TO THAT THE CREEK AND COLLECT WATER AND GO BACK AND AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT DOES. EXACTLY. OKAY YOU CAN HANDLE THE CURRICULUM AROUND THAT. KALLIO SAME COMMENTS AS THE PREVIOUS ITEM THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW FLOOD MANAGEMENT PROJECT AB PROGRAMS THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO -- CLEARLY THEY'LL BE A LOT OF DEMANDS A PRIORITIZATION IS IMPORTANT THE GENIUS OF PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT IT IS A STATE WIDE PROGRAM BY THE WAY SO OKAY CENTER STERN. THANKS JUST BRIEFLY THE CAN YOU ALL -- WAY IN A LITTLE MORE JUST. CRITERIAS ARE WHICH IS THE GENERAL SHAPE OF THE GUIDELINES WILL. WHAT WHAT WHAT MAKES A? WELL ONE PROJECT MORE SPECIFICALLY. I I APPRECIATE THE THE COMMUNITY OUT REACH EDUCATION SORT OF PARTICIPATION COMPONENTS BECAUSE THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LEAST LIKELY. TO BE ON YOUR RADAR THOSE THAT NEED HELP THE MOST OFTENTIMES LIKE HOW DO YOU FIND OUT WHO DOESN'T HAVE CAPACITY IN. OF ADDED GREAT QUESTION YEAH -- WE WE HAVE SOME TOOLS AVAILABLE TO US FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE A A AT A DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITY MAPPING TOOL LET D. W. R. HAS INVESTED IN -- SO WE CAN USE THAT AND ANYBODY CAN ACTUALLY YOU CAN PICK UP YOUR PHONE NOW AND GOOGLE DAC MAPPING TOOL T. W. R. AND YOU CAN GO TO THAT TOOL AND SEE THOSE COMMUNITIES AND WHERE THEY ARE -- THAT WITHIN THE GUIDELINES -- WE'VE TAKEN PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND HIGHLIGHTED CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE IN THERE WE WANT TO HIT. AS HIGH SCORING PROJECT FOR EXAMPLE COMMUNITY ACCESS AS PART OF THAT -- AND DISADVANTAGE GET COMMUNITY THE SO YOU'RE YOU'RE SCORING HIGH ON THOSE -- AND WE GENERALLY IN THE IN THE WE GENERALLY GET PROBABLY ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH AS REQUEST FOR FUNDS SO WITH TEN MILLION DOLLARS OUT IN OUR LASSITUDE SOLICITATION AND WE WERE FUNDING THIRTEEN PROJECTS FROM THAT MONEY BUT WE HAD PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY SIX PROJECTS THAT I HAD SUBMITTED SO. WE HAD A LOT OF DEMAND BUT GOING AGAIN GOING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION. WE WE HAVE ALL OF THE POINTS OF SIXTY EIGHT THAT WE WANT TO HIT. SO YOU'RE GONNA SCORE HIGH AND AND SO WHEN THAT THOSE DOLLARS GO OUT THE DOOR FOR THEN. THE NOT THE THE THE IN A CULVERT MANAGEMENT OR NOT THREE CAPITAL SIDE BUT ON THOSE SORT OF OPERATIONAL SIDE OF THINGS THE PROGRAMS I WHAT WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE LIKE. IN IN YOU THE WHAT WHERE YOU SUCCEED IN THE PAST NERVES OF WAS GOOD EDUCATION LOOK LIKE WHAT IS A GOOD OUT REACH PROGRAM LOOK LIKE I MEAN. WERE YOU LOOKING FOR FROM YOUR ALLEN'S OF EVALUATING THE EFFICACY OF PAST EXPENDITURES IN THIS PROGRAM I MEAN HOW. HOW YOU DEFINE SUCCESS AND HOW DO WE DEFINE SUCCESS -- WE YOUR YOU'VE DONE ALL OF YOUR TASKS IN YOUR GRANT AGREEMENT AND YOUR THE COMMUNITY HAS -- BEEN COMMITTED -- TO THE SOME OF THE NAM THAT INVOLVE WITH AS WELL BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE PROJECT AND EVERYBODY FORGETS ABOUT IT YOU WANTED AS A A CENTERPIECE OF A NEIGHBORHOOD. AND AND THE GREATER COMMUNITY SO SO THAT WE SEE A SUCCESS AND AND SOMETIMES IT DOES SOMETIMES -- A OTHER DEVELOPMENT -- UPSTREAM PERHAPS HAS CAUSED THE PROBLEM THE PROJECT TO FAIL AND EVEN THOUGH ALL THE TASKS IN THE GRANT AGREEMENT WE'RE DONE. FOR EXAMPLE STABILIZING A CREEK -- ADDING SOME VEGETATION MAY BE A FLOOD EVENT HAS WIPE THAT OUT BUT IT'S IT'S OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE COMMUNITIES AND PARTNERS. OVER TIME AND AND STAFF GOING OUT AND PHOTOGRAPHING IN DOCUMENTING THE WHAT WAS ASK FOR THEM TO DO IN THE AGREEMENT AND WE ARE PER CURRENTLY PRODUCING A WE CALLED IT A THIRTY YEAR REPORT NOW 234- YEAR APART. SO WE WILL HAVE THAT. GIVES ME -- WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR WE WE HOPE TO DO THAT SO WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF THOSE LESSONS LEARNED BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT'S WHAT. YOU ALL WANT TO NOW AND AND WE WANT TO IMPART TO ALL OF OUR PARTNERS IS WATER THOSE LESSONS LEARNED. OKAY. BUT EVEN IF THERE'S A DRAFTER ANYTHING TO LOOK AT THE FOR YEAH. IT ALL GETS FINANCING TO HELP INFORM US AS WE LEAN IN FURTHER HERE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THAT MATTER. AND LET'S MOVE ON TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE [inaudible] WE'VE GOT. A PROPOSED TEN MILLION DOLLARS. A FIFTY MILLION [inaudible] OR FORTY EIGHT POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION ANNOUNCED PENDANTS HOW YOUR COUNTY [inaudible] WELCOME. HI AGAIN MY NAME'S CHUCK BONHAM ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE -- THIS ITEM WHICH I BELIEVE IS IDENTIFIED AS ISSUE FIVE G. -- PROPOSES WITHIN THE PROP SIXTY A PROPOSAL OF AGENCY TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR DEPARTMENT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. PROPOSITION IS YOU KNOW ALLOCATES FIFTY MILLION OVERTIME SO ONE FIFTH. LET ME GIVE YOU THE QUICK BACKGROUND. IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OUR DEPARTMENT RECEIVED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AS OF JANUARY NINETEENTH THIS YEAR WE'VE COMPLETED TO WONDER PROJECTS. AND WE'RE ABOUT 90% COMPLETE OF THAT PRIOR APPROPRIATION. SO THIS REQUEST FOR TEN MILLION WILL SYNC UP TO THAT. OUR DEPARTMENT OWNS AND MANAGES ABOUT A MILLION ACRES WHICH PUTS US WITHIN PUNCHING WEIGHT OF PARKS AS TO SIZE. AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED PROPERTIES. WHAT WE'VE DONE SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN BUDGET ACT IS HER FIRST EVER INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST? AND ALSO GO DO A VAST AMOUNT OF TESTING OF ALL OUR FACILITIES. SO THE WAY WERE PRIORITIZING THIS TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS DIRECTLY ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AT OUR FACILITIES FOR EMPLOYEES -- WATER QUALITY WELLS INFRASTRUCTURE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND I'LL STOP THERE. I HAVE SOME GENERAL COMMENTS ABOUT THE COLLECTION OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSALS BEFORE THAT ARE SAFE FOR THE NEXT ITEM. ON THIS I'LL JUST SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT DID SUBMIT A LIST OF SPECIFIC PROJECTS FOR EXACTLY HOW THEY WOULD SPEND THE TEN MILLION BEFORE YOU SO THAT'S VERY HELPFUL INFORMATION TO HELP EVALUATE. HOW THE FUNDING WILL BE SPENT? THERE WAS A LITTLE MATH PROBLEM IT SEEMS ACTED REQUESTS AND THE END OF THE MISSING MONEY IS THE STATE BOND ADMINISTRATION -- THAT COMES OFF THE TOP OF EVERY -- KITCHEN OKAY. VERY GOOD COLLEAGUES ON THE ON ISSUE FIVE G.. WILL HOLD IT THANK YOU FOR THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MOVING ON TO OTHER DEFERRED MAINTENANCE GLOBALLY. SEVEN THIS REQUEST. THE PROPOSAL REQUEST FORTY FIVE MILLION FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- FOR FOUR DIFFERENT PARTS DEPARTMENTS -- THIRTY FOUR MILLION FOR STATE PARKS SIX MILLION FOR CAL FIRE THREE MILLION FOR EXPO PARK AND ONE MILLION FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS -- EACH DEPARTMENT IS PRIORITIZE IN THE PROJECTS FOR THESE FUNDS BASED ON THE MOST IMMEDIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS AND ON OPERATIONAL NEEDS. WE DID ASK SOME QUESTIONS PREVIOUSLY -- PALEO. YES AB SO GLOBAL COMMENTS ABOUT AROUND THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL AS THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING FOR BOTH PARKS AND AB VISION WILDLIFE ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE CERTAINLY WE THINK MAINTAINING AND TAKING CARE OF OUR STATE FACILITIES AND ASSETS SHOULD BE A VERY HIGH PRIORITY. WE JUST HAVE THREE KIND OF CONCERNS AND COMMENTS OVER ARCHING OVER THESE FIRST HOW WILL THIS MANY BE PRIORITIZED SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT FOR EXAMPLE FISH AND WILDLIFE HAVE PRODUCED LISTS OF EXACTLY HOW THEY WOULD SPEND THE PROPOSED FUNDING BUT OTHERS HAVEN'T FOR EXAMPLE PARKS -- SUBMITTED A LIST OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS TWO HUNDRED PAGES AND AT THE MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU ALL TO WILL BE SPENT AND PRIORITIZE THIRTY THAT WORK FOR PARKS -- YEAH COMBINED WITH THEM THE PUB SIXTY EIGHT IT'S FORTY FIVE AND THE SECOND OVER ARCHING COMMENT IS -- THE WRITING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING IS A SHORT TERM SOLUTION TO AN UNDERLYING PROBLEM SO WHAT ARE THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE. PRACTICES AT EACH OF THESE DEPARTMENTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE WE BEING THE IF WE ADDRESS THIS BACKLOG WILL THE PROBLEM BE SOLVED OR WILL IT JUST CONTINUED TO GROUSE SO. THERE WAS FUNDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND BUDGET YOU'RE FOR SOME DEPARTMENTS FOR MAINTENANCE COMBAT CONSERVATION CORPS CAL FIRE AND PARKS BUT NOT FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE EXPOSITION PARK OR THE TAHOE CONSERVANCY SO. HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE WE'RE NOT -- JUST CONTINUING TO THROW MONEY INTO A GROWING PROBLEM. AND THEN THE THIRD OVER ARCHING COMMENT IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT PROPOSE A WAY TO TRACK THE OUTCOMES FROM THIS FUNDING RIGHT NOW HOW WILL THE FUNDING BE SPENT -- WILL THEY AT WHAT PROJECTS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN AND SO AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING TWO PIECES OF SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE TO HELP YOU GET AT SOME OF THIS INFORMATION [inaudible] FINANCE. CAN YOU HEAR ALISON HERE AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT THESE SIDE IN THIS -- INVESTMENT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING DESIRED OUTCOMES WE WOULD NOTE. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE AVAILABLE AT THE REQUEST OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR MANY OF THESE DEPARTMENTS AS OPPOSED TO PROVIDING AT A BROADER -- REPORTING REQUIREMENTS HAVE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IN THINKING THAT THAT MAY BE AS INFORMATIVE AS WELL IT TO BE ASSIGNED GOAL THE SAME GOAL WITHOUT IMPOSING A A BROADER REQUIREMENT FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS. I GUESS THE OTHER THE THE LARGER QUESTION MAYBE THE SECRETARIES IS ARE WE JUST CHASING OUR TAILS HERE WITH THE WITH THE FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF JUST WITH THE PARKS -- OR IN. IN ON I PART OF THE MONEY I'M SURE YOU'RE HAPPY BUT THAT THE LARGER DEPARTMENT NEED. SURE I WOULD ALL SAY IN AN ALTERNATE OVER TO I AM TO MY COLLEAGUES BEHIND ME AS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING ONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS ON GOING MAINTENANCE NEEDS. A PART OF SORT OF THE ISSUE DEFERRED MADE AND SAYS THAT YOU HAVE SORT OF ONGOING MAINTENANCE NEEDS THAT AREN'T ADDRESSED THAT BAND SORT OF BECOME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS OVER TIME AND SO WE ARE MAKING TARGETED INVESTMENTS I BELIEVE. MY COLLEAGUE ADDRESS IT FROM THE ALLEY -- ADDRESS -- SORT OF SPOKE TO SOME OF THOSE INVESTMENTS AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO SORT OF BALANCE. THAT SERVE ON GOING NEEDS -- WITH SOME OF THESE ONE TIME INVESTMENT FRACAS WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO MY RIGHT AND THE GREAT. NORTHWEST OF CALIFORNIA HAS SAID THIS IS BEEN -- HAVE VISUAL NEGLECT FOR SOME OF% THE THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN AS WE LEARNED WITH -- THE GAS. FIVE TAX THAT SOME OF THE ROADS GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU HAVE TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT GOES FOR SO LONG THAT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT JUST THE ROOF THAT HAS TO BE REPAIRED IT'S A MAJOR SERIOUS RECONSTRUCTION AND WE THE LEGISLATURE MEAN INPUTS IT'S DO WE KEEP MORE MONEY IN THE BANK OR DO WE DO WE MAKE THESE CRITICAL INVESTMENTS IS THIS. IS THIS -- LIST GROSS SOLARZ SO LARGE AND WE YOU KNOW. WE KNOW WE HAVE A TIGHT -- PURSE DOWNSTAIRS AND FINANCED WE'D LIKE TO HAVE THE INPUT ON ON WITH THESE ARE. DO I NEED TO HAVE COLOR CODE THINGS ON THE AND WHAT ARE THE IF WE DON'T SPEND MONEY THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA SPEND TEN TIMES THE MONEY YOU KNOW -- COMING UP BECAUSE WE'VE JUST BEEN THE GOAL -- THE ROOF IF THAT'S IF THAT'S WHAT THE QUESTION IS AND AND WHAT. THE SAYS AND HELP US AT THAT WITH THAT MAKING AS DECISIONS. SORRY JUST TO CLARIFY THAT THE FORTY FIVE MILLION IN THE INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED ISN'T HELPFUL IN DOING SO WHAT WAS JUST SUSPICIOUS. DROP IN THE BUCKET RIGHT I MEAN WE WE AND I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF IS THIS. FORTY FIVE FOUR FOUR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WITH A SUPER CRITICAL ALL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT THAT WE'RE GOOD IT'S GOING TO BE THREE HUNDRED MILLION IF YOU DON'T SPEND THE MONEY THIS YEAR RIGHT. VERSES OF A HODGE PODGE OF OF BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF A A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS JUST NOT. IS MY COLLEAGUES WILL SAY NOT GRANULAR ENOUGH FAITH CLUB PUT IT ONE MORE COMMENT AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE FOLKS BEHIND ME. IT'S EITHER THE FORTY FIVE MILLION REALLY IS TARGETED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MOST CRITICAL NEEDS IN IN THE IMMEDIATE AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN GET ON THE GROUND AND SO. THEY CAN AT ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS CAN SPEAK INDIVIDUALLY TO WHAT THAT APPROACH LOOKS LIKE BUT IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT AND THE THE INVESTMENTS IN THE THE INTENT WAS TO ADDRESS. THE HIGHEST PRIORITY CRITICAL NEED PROJECTS THAT PRESENT SIGNIFICANT SORT OF FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY CONCERNS AND OTHER THINGS SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN TO MY COLLEAGUES BEHIND IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO ASK. ANOTHER CHANCE BRIAN DO WE AS A PARKS AGAIN -- GOOD AFTERNOON -- TWO ISSUES HERE ONE IS THE THE GROWTH OF THE THIS DONE. THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG -- LAST COUPLE YEARS HAVE BEEN SPENT SOME STRUCTURAL BUDGET FIXES THAT ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO HIRE ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE STAFF THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND SO WITH THOSE FOLKS IN THE FIELD -- MAINTAINING THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS THE THE THETHE THE GROWTH OF THE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG DECLINE OR HOPEFULLY STOP -- AND THEN AS FAR AS THE THE THE PRIORITY OF THE THAT THE PROJECTS TO THE THE PROJECT FUNDING FROM THE THE AMOUNT PROVIDED. OUR FOR THE HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS. FOR FOR DEPARTMENT AND A KIND OF IT X.. DESCRIBE THE PROCESS IS REALLY REALLY ROB BROADLY AND WE STARTS BY WORKING WITH DIRECTLY WITH THE DISTRICT STAFF WHO ARE IN THE FIELD. WHO -- ARE IN THE PARKS THE BEST AND THEY COME UP WITH -- LIST OF PROJECTS THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE THEIR HIGHEST PRIORITIES AND THEY ALSO RANKED AS PROJECTS. THOSE THOSE PROJECTS FROM ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE ARE SOCIALIZED INTERNET IN A DATABASE AND WE WERE PROJECTS SELECTION. WITHIN STATE PARKS AND WE LOOK AT THE HIGHEST PARTY PROJECTS THEY WERE KIND OF PASSED FOR FROM THE TO THE DISTRICTS. AND WE THEN RANK THOSE -- THOSE THOSE PROJECTS BASED ON ON THOSE CRITERIA SUCH AS HEALTH AND SAFETY WHICH IS WITH IT VERY HEAVILY AND SUCH THINGS AS RUB REVENUE AN OPERATIONAL SAVINGS THAT YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. SO MAYBE ABOUT PROJECT THAT IT IS -- RESULTED IN COSTLY ONGOING MAINTENANCE COSTS OR OTHER COSTS OF STAFF CLASS. BY DOING THE PROJECT WE CAN WE CAN ALSO AVOID -- THOSE COSTS AND IMPROVE OPERATIONS. SO WHEN YOU SEE CRITICAL -- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ART. THERE ARE SOME FACILITIES THAT ARE SIMPLY CLOSED. BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE IT'S RAINING THE RAIN'S COMING IN THERE THERE AND SAFE WITHIN WITHIN THE SYSTEM. IS. AND THEN -- SOME THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE. RAINY SEASON SO FAR EFFORT IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING IS IT CAN YOU GIVE ME AN IDEA EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BRING SOME OF THESE. FACILITIES BACK INTO USE BECAUSE OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SAID MADE THEM UNINHABITABLE AROUND AND USEFUL. FOR THE FOR THE RIVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FACILITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN IN USE BUT HAVE HAVE. EITHER I REACH THE THE PREMATURELY REACHED THEIR END OF THEIR LIFE OR NEED TO BE -- RESTORED -- UPGRADED BECAUSE OF A LACK OF ON GOING RECRUITING MAIN AND SO -- IT COULD BE WATER SYSTEMS AND AND YOU KNOW BRIDGES TRAILS IS LIKE THAT THAT HAVE BEEN MAINTAIN MAINTAIN PROPERLY AND THE THE CONDITION HAS A GREAT IS SUCH THAT WE NEED TO COME IN NOW AND DO A MUCH LARGER INVESTMENT IN JUST A ROUTINE MAINTENANCE. DOWN NO I AM OKAY. SENATE MCGUIRE MAKE IT QUICK. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING FORWARD IN APPRECIATE THE WORK AND FOCUS ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. SO. MY QUESTION IS IS IT AN HOW WE EAT IN THIS CRITICAL PROJECTS. AT OF THE BILLION ONE PROXIMATE OR BILLION DOLLARS DIFFERENT MEANS THE STATE PARK THAT. HAS. HOW MUCH THAT IS THE CRITICAL? YOU JUST MENTIONED. SO. THE THE THE WHAT ONE POINT TWO MILLION WHAT WE WE DID IS WE WE WE WENT THROUGH THE LIST AND AND TOOK -- THE HIGHEST PARTY PROJECT FOR THE PLANES THAT WERE THOSE ROUGHLY LIKE FOR SIX HUNDRED MILLION WHERE THE THOSE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. PUT FORWARD AND THEN WE THEN -- SCREEN FOR MORE TO FIND THE ONES THAT WOULD WITHIN THAT POT WITH THE ABSOLUTE MOST CRITICAL. THERE'S A LOT OF PROJECTS IN THERE THAT ARE THAT ARE THAT ARE CRITICAL -- NECESSARY PROJECTS BUT WE WE WE TARGETED THE MONEY FOR TO THOSE THAT ARE MOST CRITICAL OKAY. SO IS THERE. IN IS THERE A PLAN ON SO WHAT I'M HEARING AND I DON'T PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH. OUT OF THE BILLION. TO HALF A CRITICAL ESSENTIAL WERE OBVIOUS REASON APPROXIMATE NUMBERS WAS CRITICAL THE MOST CRITICAL THANK YOU EVERYTHING'S CRITICAL -- MOST CRITICAL IN YOU HAVE A PLAN A PROJECT PLAN IN HOUSE. FIND WHEN THOSE ARE GOING TO BE ADDRESSED WHAT I'M TRYING TO BE A TO GET AT IS. IS A FIVE YEAR PLAN TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SIX HUNDRED MILLION. IS IT A DECADE AND THAT'S THE SEAS WE START TACKLING. THE GREATER DISCUSSION AND STATE PARKS IS. IS THIS WHAT I AT AT SIX SEVEN MILLION HOW LONG SINGING TAKE YOU TO BE A TO GET THOSE FIXED. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS -- TO FOR YOUR PLAN TO ADDRESS -- ABOUT ALMOST FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF THE HIGHEST DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THAT'S CLEARLY NOT GOING -- TO ELIMINATE THE THE BACKLOG COMPLETELY WE WILL NEED -- TO MAKE FUTURE EFFORTS IN PLANNING DECISIONS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S NECESSARY. TO ADDRESS THE RIVER THE BALANCE OF THOSE OF THOSE PROJECTS. HEY IN WHILE WE HAVE ENHANCE REVENUE THAT FINALLY STARTING TO COME IN. I THINK THE CHALLENGE AND AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS INTO THE DEPARTMENTS MATH I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE AVE IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF OLD FACILITIES. THAT HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED PROBABLY FOR A DECADE OR TWO AND THE LONGER WE WAIT TO BE ABLE TO GET. TO THOSE PROJECTS THAT MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY THE MORE IT'S GOING TO COST TAXPAYERS THAT'S WHY I I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE. TO WIN THROUGH THE CHAIR OBVIOUSLY WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SEE OUT OF THOSE MOST CRITICAL PROJECTS SEE IF YOU'RE SAYING IT'S SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN THE MOST CRITICAL. OR PARAPHRASING HERE RIGHT -- SPEND DOWN. THE REASON WHY I WANT TO SAY THAT IS I SEE THAT IS. DO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE END. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT. I DO BETTER BY DOWN THAT COST. NOT EXPECTING AN ANSWER HERE TODAY SIR AND I BUT I'M VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR FOCUS ON THIS BUT WOULD LOVE. TO WHEN WE HAVE THIS. IF WE CAN GET INTO A DEEPER DIVE CHAIR. HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE DANCE BETWEEN THE BOND MONEY AND THE GENERAL FUND MONEY AND HANDS ON WHAT'S BEEN WHAT'S BEFORE IS BECAUSE WE AND AND SB ONE SO WE HAVE DIFFERENT POTS. THAT'S THE WAY WE WORK HERE AND IS THE FORTY FIVE MILLION THAT SAID THAT'S HERE FOR THE GENERAL FUND IS THAT AN AUGMENTATION. TO COMPLETE THE BUDGET TO GET THE WORK DONE IS THIS SEPARATE WORKHOW HOW DO HOW DID SIX SIXTY EIGHT ONE AND AND THIS GENERAL FUND MONEY SMOOTH IT OUT FOR ME. SO WHEN YOU. GOOD THERE ARE PROCESS WE WE END UP WITH A LIST OF PROJECTS IN PRIORITY ORDER -- THE THIRTY FOUR MILLION ONE TIME INVESTMENT. ALLOWS US TO GET DEEPER INTO THAT LIST THAN WE OTHERWISE WOULD WITH JUST A PROP SIXTY EIGHT MONEY. OKAY BUT COMPLEMENTARY. VETERANS AND ADVOCACY EACH DIFFERENT PROJECT COULD YOU LOOK AT IT BECAUSE OF BE. HELPFUL BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT THAT THE GIGANTIC PICTURE. JUST LOOK AT IT. VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT LET'S GO TO VARIOUS BOND APPROPRIATIONS L. [inaudible] HELLO -- WITH IT THERE IS A MOTION. I FORGOT A CAT THAT EVERY. AND THIS. ONE WE HAVE OKAY THERE SAID STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS THAT. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REPORT ON THE PROJECTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S ALTMAN AND TOOK WITH THE FUNDS APPROVED I THINK. PROVIDED IN IT PARTNERS REPORT ON THE SIZE OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOGS WITH WHICH WE HEARD SOME. I THINK AND IDENTIFY THE REASONS FOR THE INCREASE OF THE BACKLOG. WHEN WE COME OUT WITH THAT BEFORE MAKING A MOTION SIR IS THAT -- MISTER CHAIR. WHEN WE DO THE DEEPER DRIVER STATE PARKS WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEM PRESENT? HOME ON ON THOSE MOST CRITICAL PROJECTS -- AND WHAT THAT -- ANNUAL PLAY LOOKS LIKE OVER THE NEXT DECADE SO THAT WE CAN BE BETTER INFORMED ON TAKING DOWN THAT. MASSIVE BACKLOG VERY GOOD. I DON'T WITHOUT ON THE COMMISSION. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MY CASKEY HI. JONES [inaudible] MCGUIRE [inaudible] OPENING [inaudible] STERN. WE'LL KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I CAN GET BACK TO YOU. NOW LET'S USED TO MOVE THE ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN A SIMILAR SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR -- IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PROCESS WE COMBINED ALL THE ECHNICAL -- PROPOSALS LIKE RE APPROPRIATIONS EXTENSIONS OF LIQUIDATIONS RIVERS INS -- AN OLDER BOND REQUESTS AND THOSE ARE ALL IN ONE BC PEER -- NINETEEN TWENTY WE HAVE HEARD THE LA THOSE COMMENTS. ABOUT NOT HAVING ENOUGH DETAIL AND WHEN NEW POSITIONS ARE NEW FUNDING AND BY AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCING WERE MEETING NEXT WEEK TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION. LA ON YES THE SAME COMMENT THAT WHILE MANY OF THESE PROPOSALS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS PACKAGE ARE. TECHNICAL SOME ARE NOT AND WE THINK OU NEED ADDITIONAL DETAIL TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT THOUGH SO AB HAPPY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING COLLABORATIVELY ON THIS ISSUE. IF WE NEED TO PULL AMOUNT WILL PULL OUT ALL RIGHT FROM. MEMBERS. THIS WILL GET IT. HOLD ISSUE NUMBER. SEVEN ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD NOW GET A MOVE TO THE FISH AND WILDLIFE I'M GONNA BRING BACK. FROM MY PREVIOUS -- FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THAT. RHODEN OF UNUSUAL SIZE BUT BEFORE WE BRING FISH AND WILDLIFE CAM WE HAD A PREVIOUS THE CONSENT CALENDAR WE HAD OF ROLL CALL VOTE CAN WE CALL THE ABSENT MEMBERS JUST ON THE RIVER. CONSENT CALENDAR [inaudible] MORNING. ALL RIGHT THAT MATTERS TO PROVE THOSE MATTERS ARE PROOF FIVE ZERO WILL CLOSE TO ROLL ALRIGHT [inaudible] GREAT. BACK AGAIN -- MY NAME'S CHUCK BOTTOM ON THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. I THINK THE NEXT WOULD BE IN YOUR AGENDA ISSUE FOURTEEN YES WHICH IS RADIO REPLACEMENT SHORT STORY -- WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT WE HAVE A LAW ENFORCEMENT DIVISION -- WITHIN THAT LAW ENFORCED DIVISION WE HAVE WARDENS OR WILDLIFE OFFICERS. THE GOOD NEWS. A WE HAVE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT DIVISION AS HIGHEST IT'S EVER BEEN -- FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY SIX I BELIEVE. AND OVER THREE HUNDRED SWORN WILDLIFE OFFICERS OUT IN THE FIELD. THEIR JOB DESCRIPTION IS INCREDIBLE. THEY OPERATE IN REMOTE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THEIR JOB IS TO PROTECT OUR FISH WILDLIFE AND PLANTS. THEY'RE OFTEN MILES AWAY FROM BACK UP. AND THEY HAVE HAND HELD RADIOS AND THEY HAVE VEHICLE BASED RADIOS. THE BCP IN FRONT OF YOU IS A REQUEST OF ONE POINT SIX TUNE. NINE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND PER YEAR FOR THREE YEARS. THE BEGIN TO REPLACE THOSE WHY DO WE NEED TO REPLACE THEM THEIR OLD. THEY'RE ACTUALLY NO LONGER AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN DISCONTINUED. AND MAKE A PARTS REALLY TOUGH. IN. OF PARTICULAR NOTE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ARE WILDLIFE OFFICERS HAVE ASSISTED IN OVER TWENTY FIVE OF THE LARGE WALL AND FIRES ANOTHER NATURAL DISASTER RESPONSES. AND OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY OF THESE RADIOS DOESN'T ALLOW US TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN ALL THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. UPDATING WILL ALLOW US TO GET THAT BENEFIT AS WELL. BELIAU WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL IT IS PART OF A LARGER COORDINATED EFFORT ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT AND DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO GET THEM AT AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AS WELL GET THEM ABLE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER SO. THAT MAKES SENSE MEMBERS QUESTIONS ON RADIOS [inaudible] CENTER MONNING. THE PLAN IS A THREE YEAR. TRANSITION THE UPGRADE. HOW QUICKLY CAN YOU GET IN THE FIRST YEAR CAN YOU GET? SOME OF YEAR [inaudible] VEHICLES IN. SWORN OFFICERS CONNECTED. THE NEXT SEASON OF WHILE FAIR VENCER ORDERS IS IT TAKES THREE YEARS TO GET THE HOME. I DON'T BELIEVE WILL TAKE ALL THREE YEARS IF THE WHOLE SYSTEM BUT LET ME GET BACK TO YOU AND THE COMMITTEE ON WHAT WE CAN DO. IN A PHASED APPROACH WE'RE LOOKING AT PROBABLY SIX HUNDRED VEHICLE MOUNTED RADIOS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED HANDHELD WE'VE GOT A SUITE OF LARGE PATROL VESSELS IN THE OCEAN WHICH ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THIS. BUT I COULD COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AT YOUR PLEASURE WITH THE ACTUAL BUILD OUT OVER THAT TIME NO I THINK I THINK HIS QUESTION THIS IS THIS IS IF YOU. GIVE THE PERSON. OR THE THE THE THE UNIT THE RADIO ARE THEY THEY'RE AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTED WITH THE BIGGER. DISASTER RELIEF -- COMMUNICATIONS OR DOES IT TAKE HE IT DOESN'T UNTIL THE LAST PERSON GETS THE LAST RADIO THEN AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT ALL COMES TOGETHER TIME IS THAT. WELL YEAH I THINK HE KIND OF ADDRESS THAT BIT THE SO YOU DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENT THERE'S RULES THERE'S PORTABLE ONES THERE'S ONE SON -- WATERCRAFT -- IS THERE WAITED SEQUENCES SO. YOU GET OFFICERS EVEN WITH THEIR PORTABLE. HAND HELD COMMUNICATIONS EVEN IF THE VEHICLE HASN'T YET BEEN AMID LET ME LOOK INTO THAT IN GREAT QUESTION. AS TO THE BROADER FIRST RESPOND OR NETWORK MY AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS CALIFORNIA OPTED INTO THAT INTO -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE WOULD BE GLAD WORK CHECKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND MAKING SURE WE PROVIDE -- ANY INFORMATION TO YOU ABOUT THAT BROADER EFFORT YEAH IN THIS MAY BE TANGENTIAL BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME RECENT NEWS REPORTS OF LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS. CHANGING RADIO EQUIPMENT SO IT'S ENCRYPTED. SO PEOPLE WAS SCANNERS. INCLUDING MEDIA CAN INTERCEPT DO YOU KNOW IF. THIS NEXT GENERATION IS ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATION AND DON'T WITHOUT CHECKING BILLION WILL TAKE THAT AS A TO DO JUST CURIOUS I'LL TAKE THAT AS A MOTION CENTER MINING TO PROVE THIS BUDGET REQUEST WITH THAT CLARIFICATION. SO MOVED OKAY -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL HI [inaudible] JONES [inaudible] MCGUIRE. MONEY THAT. STERN. LEAVE THAT MATTER OPEN THE SEVENTH -- APPROPRIATE LET SOME. LET'S REVISIT RODENTS. RIGHT RIGHT NOT. YOU STOLE MY THUNDER EARLIER BEGINNING A HEARING -- SO THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FROM OUR DEPARTMENT -- ASKS FOR ONE POINT NINE FOUR NINE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND ONE TIME. TEN POSITIONS PERMANENT. AND ONE POINT SIX TWO FOUR MILLION ONGOING WHY. WE HAVE RODENTS OF UNUSUAL SIZE IN CALIFORNIA. SO THERE IS AN ANIMAL'S CALLED NUTRIA -- IT IS NATIVE TO SOUTH AMERICA IT IS NOT NATIVE TO CALIFORNIA. IT'S ABOUT THIS BIG. AND THERE DISTINCT CHARACTERISTIC IS THEY CHEW UP HABITAT. THEY BURROW -- AND THE RISKS -- FROM THIS -- ACTIVITY ARE IMMENSE TO CALIFORNIA. WHY DOES THIS MATTER WELL WE THOUGHT THEY WEREN'T IN THE STATE ANYMORE AND BACK IN MARCH OF -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE GOT A REPORT AND CONFIRM THE NUTRIENT MERCED COUNTY. SINCE THEN WE FOUND THEM ALSO IN STANISLAUS COUNTY TO ALL OF ME COUNTY FRESNO COUNTY SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. AND MARIPOSA COUNTY. THE GROWTH RATE OF THESE ANIMALS IS A STARK INCREASE FROM THE MOMENT OF DETECTION SOME OF OUR POPULATION MODEL SUGGEST WITHIN FIVE YEARS. AGO FROM A COUPLE OF ANIMALS TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND AND THEY DIG INTO LEVEES IMAGINE A LEVY COLLAPSING BECAUSE A BURROWING THEY EAT WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEY CHIU UP WETLAND HABITAT RESTORATION. THEY'RE ON THE DOORSTEP OF THE DELTA. SO IN. SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OUR DEPARTMENT CREATED AN INCIDENT COMMAND EMERGENCY SITUATION HI. RE DIRECTED AT LEAST FORTY STAFF AND OUR OWN INTERNAL FUNDING TO BEGIN TO DEAL WITH THIS WE'VE SINCE GONE OUT AND FOUND COLLABORATIVE FUNDING. FROM THE DELTA CONSERVANCY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES BUT WE GOT TO DO MORE. THIS ISN'T A RADIC ATION PROGRAM -- THIS WILL ALLOW US TO CATCH THE PROBLEM BEFORE IT COMES ON CURABLE. AND HERE IS WHERE I DON'T WANT US TO BE. SO THIS HAPPENED IN THE CHESAPEAKE BAY. A CONCERTED MULTI STATE FEDERAL LOCAL [inaudible] EFFORT. OVER FIFTEEN YEARS. REMOVED ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND NUTRIA. AND ARGUABLY SAVED A BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE RESTORATION OF THAT ECOSYSTEM. COMPARED TO LOUISIANA NO OFFENSE LOUISIANA. THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO CATCH THE PROBLEM AT THE BEGINNING NOW. WHAT THEY DO EACH YEAR IS PAY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR BOUNTIES? JUST TO KEEP THE POPULATION AT SOME STATIC LEVEL. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE BY YOU YOU CAN VISIBLY SEE THE HABITAT THEY'VE LOST. BECAUSE OF THE NUTRIENT DESTRUCTION I WANTED TO BE MORE LIKE THE CHESAPEAKE ENDEAVOR LESS LIKE THE LOUISIANA EXPERIMENT. AND THAT'S THIS PROPOSAL. WITH THE LA -- LIKE TO WEIGH IN ON THE SIX HEATING THE FERTILE MA'AM WE HAVE NO CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. PLENTY OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE NATURE. CENTER ROOM MONEY. THE ORIGIN WHERE THEY COME FROM REGIONALLY SOUTH AMERICA SOUTH AMERICA. HOW DID THE ANIMAL GET HERE WE DON'T KNOW? SOMEONE BROUGHT IT. THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO SOME OF THE UNITED STATES BACK IN THE THIRTIES OR FORTIES AS FOR BEARING [inaudible] COMMERCE -- HAVE YOU CONSIDERED BUILDING A WALL TO KEEP THEM IN. I PERSONALLY AM NOT PRO WALL THANK YOU. I WILL TAKE THAT AS A MOTION TO APPROVE THE BUDGET REQUEST -- FOR FISSION -- WILDLIFE. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHY CASKEY [inaudible] HI [inaudible] JONES [inaudible] REQUIRE. MORNING KNIGHT. STERN. WE'LL KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN HERE TWO VOTES -- I GET AHEAD NOW LET'S GO BACK INTO [inaudible] ORDER THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THIS IS. PICKING UP BACK ON ITEM NUMBER EIGHT I BELIEVE. OKAY THIS ITEM [inaudible] THIRTEEN AND EVERYBODY -- YES OKAY. ITEM THIRTEEN CONSIDER. THIS IS WHAT STATE WATER CONTROL BOARD ITEM THIRTEEN I'M SORRY I MISSPOKE [inaudible] THIS IS. THE TO CLARIFY THIS THIS BUDGET REQUEST IS COMBINED FOR BOTH TO TO BE OUR AND THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND IT IS. MAKING WATER CONSERVATION THE CALIFORNIA WAY OF LIFE. INDEED. THERE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTOPHER TRAIL AGAIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES. I'M DOING MY COLLEAGUES IN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD KAMALA INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AND HAVE TECHNICAL STAFF HERE AS WELL TO HELP OUT WITH ANY QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT COME UP WITH THIS ITEM -- YOU JUST NAME THE THE THE THE ISSUE HERE IS HOW TO MAKE CONSERVATION A CALIFORNIA WAY OF LIFE AND THAT'S A VERY -- INTENTIONAL WAY I THINK OF OF FRAMING THIS ISSUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS -- REALLY BUILDING OFF OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WHICH IS A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO BODY SUFFICIENCY IN CALIFORNIA NOT PORTFOLIO APPROACH NEED TO MOVE BEYOND KIND THE BUMPER STICKER MEANING OF PORTFOLIO INTO. WHAT'S REALLY NECESSARY TO START CHANGING THE CULTURE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT WATER USE EFFICIENCY IS HERE TO STAY SO THAT IT'S DURABLE IT'S REAL IT DOESN'T GO AWAY WITH WITH CHANGE COULD NEVER MINISTRATIONS OR TURN OVER IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT THAT IT REALLY BECOMES SOMETHING THAT IS -- A BEDROCK OF HOW CALIFORNIA -- DOES ITS BUSINESS AND AND AND AND HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES. AND SO THERE ARE SEVERAL PIECES AND AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND HOW THAT COMES TOGETHER ONE IS LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS WHETHER THEY COME FROM. A LOCAL AGENCIES THEMSELVES ARE FROM THE STATE. THERE'S TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE AT THE STATE AND ALSO THE LOCAL LEVEL. IT'S REALLY USEFUL FOR WATER USE EFFICIENCY - THERE'S ALSO THINGS LIKE PUBLIC EDUCATION VERY IMPORTANT THAT CULTURAL ASPECT OF IMPROVING WORRIES EFFICIENCY BEEN BEFORE YOU WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE YOU IN THE PAST ASKING FOR FUNDS FOR THE SAVE OUR WATER CAMPAIGN IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL. AND REALLY LEVERAGING LOCAL PUBLIC EDUCATION AND EFFORT AND THERE'S IS FOURTH COMPONENT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. AND THAT IS THE POLICY SIDE OF IT AND LAST YEAR AS WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB SIX OR SIX BY CENTER HERTZBERG. AND ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BY SOME WOMEN FOR FRIEDMAN AND BECOME A MEMBER FRIEDMAN. AND AND WHERE IMPLEMENTING THESE THESE TWO PIECES OF COMPLEMENTARY LEGISLATION -- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD I'M VERY PLEASED TO SAY THAT AND I HAVE ONE COPY TO LEAVE YOU TODAY AND WE CAN CERTAINLY COME BACK WITH MORE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. A COPY OF THIS DOCUMENT. THAT IS A A PRODUCT OF A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN OUR TWO STATE AGENCIES IN VERY CLEARLY ARTICULATING FOR OURSELVES VERY IMPORTANT YOU LOOK AT INTER AGENCY AND HAVE CO IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY. I'M FOR THE PUBLIC IT'S A ROAD MAP OF OUR PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. AND WHICH THEN OF COURSE GETS TO THE BUDGET NEEDS -- WERE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH MY MODEST REQUESTS FOR BOTH OF OUR DEPARTMENTS -- IN HELPING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND HAPPY TO WALK YOU THROUGH SOME OF THOSE PIECES -- BUT INTEREST OF TIME YOU DON'T. KEEP MY COMMENTS THERE TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES AT THE WATER BOARD AND THEN SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIR AND AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS EILEEN SO BACK I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR F THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND MY COLLEAGUE JUST SAID I THINK WE HAVE COMPLEMENTARY -- PROPOSALS HERE TO IMPLEMENT -- THE REQUIREMENTS SET OUT IN THE RECENTLY PASSED LEGISLATION -- THE WATER BOARD IS LOOKING -- FOR FOR NEW POSITIONS AND SOME CONTRACT FUNDS MOSTLY TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE URBAN WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES THAT WERE SET OUT AND IN THE STATUTES AND WE LOOK AT LOOK FORWARD TO AND TAKING SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED WE LEARNED. THAT WE GAINED DURING THE DROUGHT AND SOME OF MANDATORY EMERGENCY MEASURES AND AND MOVE THOSE FORWARD IN A WITH A MORE ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS OF FIGURING OUT LONG TERM. AND LONG TERM STRATEGIES FOR OUR REGULATORY PROGRAMS -- TO IMPLEMENT THOSE -- BEFORE WE WE GET BACK INTO THAT TIME KIND OF DROUGHT SITUATION. HELLO. I WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATION THERE IS A LOT THAT THESE TWO DEPARTMENTS NEED TO DO LAID OUT IN THE IN THE LEGISLATION OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. WE DO HIGHLIGHT AND IN OUR BUDGET REPORT IN THEIR INCLUDED ON PAGE THIRTY FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA SOME OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS WE THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT TO BE ASKING OVER THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS. BOTH KIND OF ON THE PROCESS SIDE ARE THEY HITTING THOSE DEADLINES ARE WE IMPLEMENTING AT THE PACE WE INTENDED TO TERM OBJECTIVES DOES THIS LEAD. TO LESS WATER USE AND GREATER WATER EFFICIENCY OVER TIME SO WE WON'T KNOW THAT TODAY WE WON'T KNOW THAT NEXT YEAR BUT AS THE STANDARDS GET IN PLACE ARE WE SEEING SO BOTH NEAR TERM AND LONGER TERM OVERSIGHT. AND HOW DO THESE CONSERVATION -- CHANGES WE MAKE HOW DO PEOPLE REACT NOW THAT WE HAVE A DILUTION OF RAIN RIGHT YOU KNOW I THE IS IS THIS SOMETHING IS TO SET. YOU KNOW PHONY ACTING THAT PEOPLE SAY OH YELP PRETEND I WON'T I WON'T WATER MY LAWN NOW BUT NOW THAT THE RAINS HAVE COME IN THE LINES COME BACK AND IT LOOKS NICE. IN OVER THE SUMMER TIME DID THEY SAY WILL WILL JUST TURN BACK HONOR WE GET LET THEM GO BROWN AGAIN LIKE THEY LIKE TO HILLS. CENTER MONNING OF QUESTION. OKAY I AM WE DO YOU. HAVE. IT'S AT REQUEST IS APPROVED AS A AS BUDGET. OKAY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WE CASTING HI. JONES MCGUIRE MONNING STERN. OKAY WE'LL KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN RUNNING LATE -- NOW WHERE AM I AT DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. THERE IS HALF. IS THE COMBINED. THIS WILL BE SENT [inaudible] WELCOME BACK. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER. EIGHT MR COULD YOU CLARIFY WHICH ITEM ON DECEMBER ON SAME THINK I THINK I MIGHT DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES I THINK WHAT WE HAVE. EIGHT THROUGH TWELVE AS WERE GOING I CHECK I DID THE COMBINED ONE FIRST BUT I ONLY. CALLED UP THE WATER RESOURCE FOR THE NOT THE DEPARTMENT -- YEAH. THE STATE WATER RESEARCH PART LET'S GO ONE EIGHT THIS IS THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD. PROTECTION -- BOARD PERMITTING AND ENFORCEMENT BRANCH SUPPORT OKAY TURNED UP GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MR WHAT CASKEY AND MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS LESLIE GALLAGHER I'M THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE-CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD. AND I DO APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAD AND I DO YOU HAVE ABOUT A TWO MINUTE TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT AND RESPOND TO THOSE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND THE WALLS GOING TO COME UP AGAIN SO -- YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY FOR THAT SENATOR MINING. FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS THE BOARD HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH OVERSEEING THE STATE PLAN OF FLOOD CONTROL FACILITIES. BUT THIS IS KIND OF A UNIQUE SITUATION AND I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTACTS. IN THE MATTER OF FEDERAL FLOOD PROJECTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE BOARD IS THE NON FEDERAL SPONSOR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS THROUGH A MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BOARD THE DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENT HAS OBTAINED THE STATE'S SHARE OF FUNDING AND EW OUR STAFF WORK AS PROJECT MANAGERS ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD. FOR YOUR LARGE SCALE IMPROVEMENTS. THE BOARD ALSO HAS A REGULATORY ROLE THE BOARD MANAGES THE LOCAL MAINTAINING AGENCIES PERFORMING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ON THE FACILITIES AND MANAGES THE ENCROACHMENTS AROUND THE STATE PLAN OF FLOOD CONTROL AND THAT IS OUR REGULATORY -- REQUEST THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY. IN THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN CONGRESS PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO TO BE SPENT ON THEIR PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THIS FUNDING AMOUNTED TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN TIMES THE NORMAL FUNDING THAT'S GIVEN TO THE ARMY CORPS FOR THESE PROJECTS. THE STATE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO CLEAR THE DECKS SO THAT THESE ARMY CORPS PROJECTS COULD BE BUILT IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE BOARD MADE SURE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT CAN PROCEED IN AN EXPEDITED SCHEDULE BY REMOVING THE ENCROACHMENTS THAT EXIST BEFORE CONSTRUCTION CAN BE COMPLETED. MORE RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN SPECULATION THAT THE PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY DECLARATION OF THE BORDER WALL FUNDING COULD IMPACT THE ARMY CORPS AND THIS PROJECT AND THAT'S WHAT YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ABOUT I AM SPECIFICALLY IF THE FEDERAL FUNDING DOESN'T MATERIALIZE WHAT'LL HAPPEN WITH THESE PROJECTS. AND I THINK IT'S UNWISE TO SPECULATE. I KNOW IT'S NOT CURRENTLY ON THE LIST BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT WE HAVE DONE -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAINTAIN AND MANAGE THESE FUNDS -- WE DO HAVE A SIGN PROJECT PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT THAT THE BOARD EXPEDITED ON IT SCHEDULED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD BE AS READY AS SHOVEL READY AS POSSIBLE -- ALL THE PARTIES ALSO WHICH IS THE STATE THE FEDERAL AND THE LOCAL FUNDING WHICH IS SAFE GATHERED AT THAT CRIMINAL AREA FLOOD CONTROL AGENCY. WE DO HAVE ADEQUATE WORK PLAN MANY ALREADY SET ASIDE FOR DESIGN AND DESIGN IS ON GOING. SO PRACTICALLY EVEN IF THESE FUNDS WERE DIVERTED -- THE SPECIFIC POSITION QUESTING TODAY MAY GO AND FILLED FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. BUT THE GREATER RISK IS IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS IN PLACE THEN WE DO GO FORWARD WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE PLANNING -- FOR THAT WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MEET THAT -- VERY TIGHT CONSTRUCTION TIMELINE THAT CAME ALONG WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING OR THE THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT FUNDING. SO THE QUOTE THE REQUEST HERE IS FOR STAFFING AND REIMBURSABLE AUTHORITY SO THERE IS NO GENERAL FUND ATTACHED AT THIS TIME. FOR THE SACRAMENTO RIVER EAST LEVY PROJECT. THE SAFETY BOARD HAS AGREED TO THE FUNDING OUTLINED IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST AND WE ARE REQUESTING THAT THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOLLOW STAFF RECOMMENDATION AND APPROVE THIS REQUEST IS BUDGETED. I COULD TAKE ANY OTHER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL ALL. WHEN CASKEY HI [inaudible] JONES REQUIRE [inaudible] MORNING [inaudible] STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHECK -- I OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON SANDY MASUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND I WILL BE TAKING UP THIS A PARTICULAR AGENDA ITEM AND THE NEXT. SO STARTING WITH THIS ONE THE CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE GROUNDWATER ELEVATION MONITORING PROGRAM HAS GEM. IS THE FIRST DATABASE CREATED TO COLLECT GROUND WATER ELEVATION DATA STATE WIDE SO IT COLLECTS FOR ALL FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN ALLUVIAL BASINS SO IT'S THE FIRST OF ITS KIND. THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IS REQUESTING TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS THEREAFTER FOR MAINTENANCE OF WELL OF THE VACATION AND WHILE DRILLING DATA. THE CAST HIM SYSTEM IS USED FOR MONITORING ENTITIES TO MEET MANDATED GROUNDWATER ELEVATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THE FUNDING WILL ALSO SUPPORT T. W. R. STAFF TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE ENTITIES AND GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES ARE GSA'S. AS THEY MODIFY CAL JIM HAS JIM INFORMATION AND MONITORING PLANS TO ACCOMMODATE THE SIGMA REQUIREMENTS WHICH WE HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT A LITTLE EARLIER IN THE AGENDA. THIS FUNDING WILL ALSO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE THE ONLINE WELL COMPLETION REPORTING SYSTEM WHICH GIVES. WHICH GIVES US A COMPLETE INVENTORY OF WELLS. THAT ARE IT WITHIN THE STATE AND NEW WELLS AS THEY COME ON LINE. AND THAT ALSO SUPPORTS GROUNDWATER EFFORTS SO WITH THAT THAT IS OUR PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. YEAH WE THINK THIS WILL HELP DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE PICTURE OF OUR GROUNDWATER RESOURCES MAKES SENSE NO CONCERNS [inaudible] ALL. MY CASKET HI JONES MCGUIRE MORNING. STERN. YEAH MATTER OF GREAT OKAY THANK YOU SO PARA STAMMER MEDIATION. DAM AND RESERVOIR OR AS YOU MENTIONED LOCATED IN SAN JUAN SAN BERNADINO COUNTY. AND THE SERVICE A TERMINAL RESERVOIR FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT. THE LAKE PERRIS STATE RECREATION AREA IS A POPULAR AND HIGHLY VISITED RECREATIONAL FACILITY WITH OVER ONE MILLION VISITORS ANNUALLY. IT PROVIDES BOATING SWIMMING AND OTHER WATER BASED RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE REGION. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL SEISMIC SAFETY RISKS IN ONE SECTION OF THE FOUNDATION OF PARIS DAM. IN IN OCTOBER OF THAT SAME YEAR WE MOVED AHEAD WITH EARLY PHASES OF THE REPAIRS. THE SEISMIC RETROFIT AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE DAM ITSELF WAS COMPLETED IN MARCH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE TOTAL PROJECT COST IS AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION. THESE RICH THE NATIONAL PHASE REPAIRS. WERE -- INSTITUTED TO CORRECT CONCERNS WITH THE FOUNDATION AND PROVIDED STABILIZATION TO THE DOWNSTREAM FACE OF THE DAM. INSTALLATION OF A SYSTEM OF RELIEF WELLS TO ADDRESS SEEPAGE ISSUES. AND OTHER ANCILLARY IMPROVEMENTS. THERE TO PROJECT ELEMENTS THAT STILL REMAIN TO BE COMPLETED THE PARIS DAM OUTLET TOWER IMPROVEMENTS PROJECT. IN THE PARIS DAM OUR MERCHANT SEE RELIEF FACILITY PROJECT. THESE TWO PROJECTS WILL FURTHER ADDRESS SEISMIC ISSUES RELATING TO THE RESERVOIRS ABILITY TO MAKE RELEASES. PROPOSITION EIGHTY FOUR THE SAFE DRINKING WATER WATER QUALITY AND SUPPLY. FLOOD CONTROL RIVER AND COASTAL PROTECTION BOND ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIX INCLUDED FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY FOR RECREATION AND FISH AND WILDLIFE ENHANCEMENT COSTS AS THEY RELATE TO STATE WATER PROJECT FACILITIES. THIS PROTECT PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY REQUEST FIVE MILLION OF THOSE FUNDS IN SUPPORT OF THE BENEFITS OF THE OVERALL SEISMIC REMEDIATION PROJECTS. PROVIDED. THAT THEY PROVIDE TO THE RECREATION AND FISH AND WILDLIFE ENHANCEMENT COMPONENTS OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. THESE DOLLARS -- PER THE PROPERTY -- FOR GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS OR RESTRICTED FOR THE USE OF SORRY A RESTRICTED FOR THE USAGE OF PROPOSED OF THIS PROPOSAL AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH PAST LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. RELATED -- TO RECREATION AND FOR THISPARTICULAR FACILITY HANDS. OTHERS SO WITH THAT I THINK THAT IS THE PROPOSAL TODAY BEFORE YOU AND AGAIN HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THE SAILORS HELLO YEAH YEAH SO THIS IS PART OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT AS YOU KNOW USUALLY IT'S THE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRACT USERS WHO PAY FOR THE FACILITIES AT BUT IN. SOME FACILITIES WHEN THERE IS A RECREATION AND FISH AND WILDLIFE BENEFIT IT HAS APPROPRIATE AND AND TRADITION. FOR THE STATE TO PAY A SHARE AS WELL SO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IS BASED ON THE ESTABLISHED COST SHARE BETWEEN THE STATE AND PROJECT BASED ON PRIOR -- ACTIVE SO WE HAVE NO CONCERNS RED. SO MOVE LET'S CALL THE ROLL. WE CAN ASKING HI JONES MCGUIRE MONNING [inaudible] STERN. LEAVE THAT MATTER OPEN. LET'S GO TO OUR FLOOD IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS STATEWIDE THIS IS ITEM. ELEVEN MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AGAIN CHRIS TRAIL DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES. SO CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION. IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB FIVE WAS BY THEN SENATOR -- MACHADO AND OF THE MANY FLOOD RELATED THINGS THAT REQUIRED REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT BUT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP AND CENTER BY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD TO ADOPT. A KIND OF US INTO A MASTER PLAN FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- THAT THE FIRST ITERATION THAT PLAN WAS DEVELOPED AND ADOPTED IN TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE SECOND M. ITERATION WAS DEVELOPED AND ADOPTED BY THE BY THE FLOOD BOARD. AND THERE ARE OTHER OUR LOTS OF RECOMMENDATIONS OF LOTS AND LOTS OF IMPORTANT PIECES AS PART OF THAT PLAN -- BUT A COUPLE I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU TODAY BECAUSE THE SYSTEM OF FLOOD PROTECTION FACILITIES THAT THE STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AND THE LOCAL AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. NEEDS A LOT OF HELP NEEDS TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE NEXT -- SEVERAL DECADES -- TO REALLY GET IT TO WHERE -- IT NEEDS TO BE EVEN TODAY BUT CERTAINLY LOOKING AHEAD ADDED CLIMATE CHANGE ORLD WITH A SEA LEVEL RISE IMPACTS AND CHANGING IN ONE HYDROLOGY IMPACTS -- THE SECOND THING I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THAT WAS A MAJOR FOCUS AND IF AND IN PARTICULAR IS TWENTY SEVENTEEN CENTER BY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN. DOCUMENT UPDATE WAS. THE FACT THAT AS WE DO THESE FLOOD PROJECTS WE ALSO SHOULD BE CAN BE. MUST BE. ALSO PURSUING IMPROVEMENTS TO FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT ALONG THE WAY. TURNS OUT THERE ARE A LOT OF JUST LIKE THERE ARE ACROSS THE STATE BUT IN BUT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN PARTICULAR IT'S CERTAINLY OUR FOCUS TODAY THERE A LOT OF LEGACY IMPACTS WHETHER SOME GOLD MINING. DREDGING -- LEVYING ARMS BASIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT'S BEEN NECESSARY OVER THE COURSE OF THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA AND DOES ECONOMIC ACTIONS OF BECAUSE A LOT OF DEGRADATION TO THE ECOSYSTEMS IN THE VALLEY. AND TURNS OUT THAT A LOT OF WHAT WE CAN DO FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT TO REDUCE RISK TO LIVES IN ECONOMY. ALSO CAN BE DONE IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS FISH AND WILDLIFE'S ARE TURNING BACK THE CLOCK IN THAT CONVERSATION. AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT TH TO BUDGET ITEMS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU HEAR BOTH ONE RUN NOW AND AND COMING NEXT REALLY. REALLY GET AT AND THAT IS HOW CAN WE PRIORITIZE INVESTMENT IN PROJECTS USING WHAT PROPOSITION ONE IN PROPOSITION -- SIXTY EIGHT TO GET OUTCOMES THAT BOTH REDUCE THE RISK TO HUMAN LIFE. AND TO OUR ECONOMY IS ABOUT THE SAME TIME DOING THOSE PROJECTS IN WAYS THAT IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT -- TURNS OUT THAT MORE AND MORE OPPORTUNITY ARE -- ARE OUT THERE ARE BEING DEVELOPED ARE SUPPORTED BY LOCAL AGENCIES BY US BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT USED TO BUDGET PROPOSALS ARE ALL ABOUT IT'S PROVIDING THAT STATE -- OF VALUE IF YOU WILL AND INVESTMENT IN THOSE PROJECTS A VERY EXCITING THEY RANGE IN SCALE FROM HUGE LEVY SETBACKS MORTAL MILES LONG LIKE IN THE YOLO BYPASS WHICH IS CURRENTLY UNDER WATER AS IT SHOULD BE RIGHT NOW -- DOING ITS JOB AS A FLOOD CONTROL PROTECTION PROTECTION -- FACILITY FOR THIS REGION -- TO SMALLER PROJECTS SO FIXING CULVERTS FIXING GATES FIXING YEARS THAT -- THAT SERVE A CRITICAL FLOOD PROTECTION ROLE BUT ALSO MAYBE HAVE A HAVE HAVE CAUSED A CONFLICT WITH WHAT FISHERIES SPECIES -- OVER THE YEARS AND DESERVE TO BE ADDRESSED AGAIN GETTING THOSE TWO PUBLIC VALUES OF FLOOD MANAGEMENT AND HABITAT RESTORATION AND WITH A SINGLE PROJECT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AND HAPPY TO ASK YOUR ANSWER RATHER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. I'LL MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT ISSUE ELEVEN AND TWELVE TOGETHER WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS THE USES SEEM CONSISTENTWITH THE BOND LANGUAGE AS WELL AS THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN. WILL KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO INCLUDE AND SCHEDULE OUT EACH OF THESE PROJECTS IN BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WITH THE AMOUNTS OF THAT IF THEY WERE CHANGES THEY WOULD COME BACK TO YOU THROUGH THE GEL BC PROCESS WHICH IS HELPFUL LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WE'VE. AB MASS FOR AND IN YOUR SO THAT'S HELPFUL TO YOU KNOW I WAS GOING TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC. HEARING FOR ALL THE MATTERS WE WANT WE AS I EVER I AM ALWAYS CHANGING WHY DON'T I OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING JUST ON THE ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN AND AND I'LL CALL ON THIS NUMBER TWELVE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT. THEN I'LL HAVE ANOTHER PUBLIC HEARING FOR ALL THE OTHER MATTERS BEFORE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LIKE TO HAVE A COMMENT ON ANOTHER ITEM AND ALL WEEK TO THE REAL AND THE HEARING FOR THAT FOR THAT -- VERY NIELSEN WITH THE GOLDEN GATE SAME ASSOCIATION I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT NUMBER -- ELEVEN OF MISTER JANELLE JUST OF SUMMARIZE BRIEFLY WHAT THE STATE WATER BOARD I'M SORRY FOR WHAT THE STATE -- OF SAID REALLY FLOOD CONTROL PROTECTION PLAN ADOPTED A COUPLE YEARS AGO IT'S A A A A DRAMATICALLY NEW DIRECTION FOR FLOOD PROTECTION THAT FOCUSES ON INVESTMENTS. IN OF IN ALL FLOOD BY PASSES AND FLOOD SAID BEFORE IT AND AND FLOODPLAIN EXPANSION PROJECT VERY MUCH LIKE OF THE THE ALL OF THE OLD BYPASS PROJECT THAT MISTER CHANNEL JUST MENTIONED. LET'S PROJECTS ARE NOT ONLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE FLOOD MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THEY'RE ALSO CRITICAL FOR HABITAT RESTORATION AND ESPECIALLY RESTORATION FOR SAM THAT'S WHY SALMON FISHERMEN ARE ACTIVELY SUPPORTING THESE. FLOOD RESTORATION PROJECTS THEY KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND THEY ALL THEY PROVIDE THE FOOD AND HABITAT THE NECESSARY FOR SAM POPULATIONS TO RECOVER. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES HAS GONE THROUGH A REORGANIZATION TO ALIGN THEMSELVES BETTER AROUND ALL AROUND THIS ISSUE O REALLY AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE THIS. I THINK WITH THIS BUDGET REQUEST YOU'RE REALLY SAYING THAT WE'RE SEEING PROGRESS NOW ON A A HOST OF OF PROJECTS -- WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY MEMBERS OF IN THIS REQUEST OF THOSE PROJECTS ARE READY FOR CONSTRUCTION -- PROBABLY THE BIGGEST OF THOSE IS ACTUALLY NOT BEFORE YOU TODAY THAT IS OF THE PROPOSED NOTCH IN THE FREMONT WE'RE ON THE YOLO BYPASS THAT'S PART OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT'S BUDGET WHICH FOR ODD REASONS AS WE ALL KNOW IS NOT BEFORE YOU TODAY -- BUT I JUST WANT TO TO COME HERE AND GIVE THE DEPARTMENT CREDIT FOR RE ALIGNING THEMSELVES TO PUSH THESE PROJECTS -- SUPPORT THE PROJECT BEFORE YOU TODAY AND WE OOK FORWARD -- TO BEING FOR YOU AGAIN WHEN WE'RE READY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH -- EVEN LARGER CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THANK YOU WE'RE THE PLAN IS TO HOLD THIS PARTICULAR ITEM BUT WE HAVE. OTHER THINGS [inaudible] NEXT COMMENT. MR CARE MEMBERS ADAM ROBIN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION ON BEHALF OF WATER SUPPLIERS IN SACRAMENTO VALLEY WE SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSED ALLOCATION LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND TAKE UP THIS ITEM AND FUTURE DATE THANK YOU. EXCELLENT. OKAY OUT WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM THAT'S GOOD LET'S FINISH UP ON ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE WHICH IS THE FLOOD RISK REDUCTION. I ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WANTED ADD. REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS JUST CAN'T MOSTLY -- IN ISSUE OF SCALE THE PREVIOUS ITEM WAS REALLY LOOKING AT THESE LARGER SCALE PROJECTS AND THESE ARE THEMATICALLY VERY SIMILAR SAME OBJECTIVES JUST GENERALLY SMALLER IN SCALE. OKAY LA L.. NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OKAY [inaudible] COMMENTS. OKAY I WILL. WE'RE GONNA HOLD THE MATTER SO -- WILL KEEP IT THERE WILL COME BACK. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR ANY MATTER THAT'S COME BEFORE. US THAT WE'VE HELD [inaudible] OR OTHERWISE. PLEASE COME FORWARD AND THE PROBLEM WITH WITH THIS. COMPUTE AFTER HIM GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER MONNING -- THAT'S ALL ALSO ON BEHALF OF WATER REUSE CALIFORNIA JUST WANTED TO SUPPORT -- YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT IN THE HEARING BUT THERE IS FUNDING AND PROP SIXTY EIGHT FOR WATER RECYCLING. WEHAVE A LONG EXHAUSTED THE FUNDING FROM PROP ONE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS LIST OF OF WATER RECYCLING PROJECTS THAT ARE WAITING FOR MORE FUNDING. THIS IS A GREAT DROP IN THE BUCKET. TO GET IN SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS OFF THE LIST SO THANK YOU AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS MATTER WHEN IT COMES BACK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AND AND AND CENTER MONNING OF ALL BEARING ALSO AGAIN WITH THE GOLDEN GATE SEVEN ASSOCIATION ALL ITEM FIVE A IS THE ITEM YOU HAD EARLIER ON YOUR AGENDA TO DISCUSS VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. ARE AND OF MY ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS COULD BE VERY HELPFUL IN. HELPING COMPLY WITH STATE WATER BOARD REQUIREMENTS AND RESTORING HABITAT THE PROBLEM IS THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT PACKAGE THIS BEFORE YOU BEFORE THE STATE WATER BOARD RIGHT NOW SUBMITTED. SIX DAYS AGO IS DRAMATICALLY INADEQUATE -- WE'VE LOOKED AT THE REQUIREMENTS POINT DOES NOT -- COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF PROP SIXTY EIGHT OF THE AS OF AS MR BONHAM OUTLINED. THAT PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE WATER AND HABITAT TO HELP RESTORE THE BAY DELTA IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY THAT'S A THAT'S A A LAUDABLE IDEA. THE PROBLEM IS MUCH OF THE HABITAT PROPOSED -- IS HABITAT THAT'S ALREADY COMMITTED TO AND IN SOME CASES LITERALLY ALREADY CONSTRUCTED ON SO MUCH OF THE HABITAT PROPOSED TO BE BLUNT IS NOT REAL. ALL AND ON THE WATER SIDE. THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF RECLAMATION HAS MODELED THIS VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND THEIR MODELING SO THIS IS THE BUREAU'S MODELING HOW THIS VSA WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. SHOWS THAT THIS THE THE THIS PROPOSAL WOULD NOT INCREASE PROTECTIONS IN THE BAY DELTA IT WOULD ACTUALLY DRAMATICALLY WEAKENED PROTECTIONS IN THE BAY DELTA BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF ROLL BACKS. FOR THESE PROTECTIONS NOW UNFORTUNATELY THE VOLUNTARY SOME AGREEMENT. APPEARS NOT TO PRECLUDE THAT ROLL BACK SO IT IT ACTUALLY SETS UP THE POSSIBILITY HAT OF THAT SOME WATER AGENCIES WOULD CONTRIBUTE MORE WATER THE BAY DELTA. BUT THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION WOULD GRAB THAT WATER AND THEN ADDITIONAL WATER. IN THE NORMAL CONDITIONS IN THE DELTA WOULD ACTUALLY WORSEN THAT'S NOT. ALL CONSISTENT WITH PROP SIXTY EIGHT ON AGAIN WE DO BELIEVE THAT VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS HAVE A PLACE WITH THEIR DRAMATICALLY AN ADEQUATE -- WE'VE JUST COMPLETED AN ANALYSIS THIS OF THIS OF PACKAGE IT'S NOT REALLY AN AGREEMENT YET. ON WILL SUBMIT THAT AND WITH A LETTER -- TO TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE HOLDING A LOT OF WORK LEFT TO BE DONE TO TURN THIS INTO A CREDIBLE PACKAGE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. IS THE CHAIR AND SENATOR MINING IS ELEMENT THAT IS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY JUST QUICK TO POINT SINCE AS THE AFTERNOON ALREADY. IN REGARDS TO FIVE A AND VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WE JUST WANTED TO THANK DIRECTOR -- BONHAM AS WELL AS DIRECTOR IN THE MID FOR THEIR ONGOING WORK ON THE ISSUE AND LOOK FORWARD TO A CORE NEEDING EFFORTS GOING FORWARD AS WELL AS FIVE D. IT'S ALREADY KIND OF BEEN SAID BY THE LA -- AS WELL AS AN STAFF COMMENTS WERE GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS RELATED TO SIGNAL BUT WE JUST FEEL THERE'S A LACK OF SPECIFICITY SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING ADDITIONAL DETAILS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU TURN NUMBERS% AFTER NUMBER THANK YOU TO CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I'M ON FIVE A LIKE TO LIKE MY COMMENTS WITH MISTER NELSON ENERGY SEIZE OPPOSED TO THE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR. BUDGET REQUEST FOR VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT'S PREMATURE TO APPROVE FUNDING FOR V. ESSAYS THAT ARE STILL AWAITING ANALYSIS AND APPROVAL BY THE STATE WATER BOARD THE WATER BOARD WILL BE CONSIDERING VIA SAY THAT'S AN ALTERNATIVE IN ITS UPDATE TO THE BAY QUALITY. THE BAY DELTA WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN OUT NO LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED OR APPROVED AT THIS TIME AT THE VERY LEAST IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE REST OF THE YEAR. MORE LIKELY IN TEN TWENTY TWENTY BEFORE THIS IS COMPLETE SO WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE -- FOR THE MORE WE BELIEVE THAT A CREDIBLE SCIENTIFIC OF EVALUATION OF THE AGREEMENTS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED UNDER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WILL SHOW THAT THEY ARE INADEQUATE TO PROTECT THE HEALTH. OF THE BAY DELTA TO PROTECT HEALTHY SALMON RUNS IN THE THOUSANDS OF JOBS THAT DEPEND ON OUR NEED OF SALMON RUNS SO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THE ITEM OPEN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED DISCUSSION AROUND THIS. REALLY QUICKLY ON ITEM -- THIRTEEN ENTITIES HE STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE JOINT REQUESTS BY THE W. ARE THE WATER BOARD TO FUND THE WATER EFFICIENCY BILLS THAT WERE. SIGNED INTO LAW LAST YEAR -- WE WERE CAN CONSERVATION WAY OF LIFE BILLS -- THIS IS REALLY CRITICAL TO TRANSFORMATIONAL WAY TO MANAGER STATES WATER SUPPLIES TO ENSURE RELIABILITY IN THE FACE OF LONGER AND MORE PERSISTENT ROUTES SO WHERE IT REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS BRAND DAWSON ON THE OFFICE YOUR CALL CALIFORNIA WE WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE GUYS ITEM FIVE A WITH IN OUR DC -- WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE VSA AGREEMENTS OR ARE ENFORCEABLE LET ALONE THEY LACKS SUBSTANCE AND PROCESS OF THE PROCESS WAS NOT THE MOST TRANSPARENT INTERVIEW -- AND WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE NOT FROM THOSE VSA AGREEMENTS PREMATURELY -- AND WITH REGARDS TO WHAT JEFF YOU DIRECTOR MR CENTER SO IF YOU ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO WEIGH IN ON THE VSA AGREEMENTS TO FUNDING. AND WE BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN DO THAT BY HOLDING OPEN AND FINDING OUT MORE SCIENTIFIC DATA BEFORE YOU DO SO SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ADAM ROBIN ON BEHALF OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT CITY'S WATER SUPPLIERS RURAL COMMUNITIES COUNTIES AND LOCAL LANDOWNERS IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS FIRST ARE PRECIADO CHIN TO THE AGENCY SECRETARIES THE DEPARTMENTS IN THE DIRECTORS THIS BUT IT'S A LOT [inaudible] IT. FOR IT THIS NEW SIR DESCRIPTION. THE CONCERNS YOU'RE DOING AND I THINK A MEDICAL A LONG WAYS TO ADDRESSING SOME [inaudible] SEARCH [inaudible] AS WELL [inaudible] WHAT THAT'S AND THAT THEY COULD ALSO USE I AM BENEFIT GREATLY FROM EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF FUNDING SOME SOME REALLY WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AS AS AN ISSUE THERE -- AND THEN FINALLY -- ON BEHALF OF AUTO IN CALIFORNIA THE TRANSPLANT -- SKEWS ME THE NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY WANNA MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT. WHAT YOU CHAIR WHILE RAISING ABOUT THE NEED TO NOT JUST RELYING ON PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT AND AND THIS ISSUE OF SUPPLANTING PROP SIXTY EIGHT FORD FOR WHAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS -- IN IN NEEDS TO BE KEPT IN MIND WE HEARD EARLY ON WHEN THE WHEN THE PROPOSAL WAS FIRST PUT OUT IN JANUARY BY THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT -- AND WHAT SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE ALREADY HANDLED IN PROP SIXTY EIGHT THAT'S WHY WE MAYBE DECREASE THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE OR DID YOUR AFTER WHATEVER THE OTHERS AND SPECIAL FUND WOULD HAVE BEEN. WE SIMPLY DISAGREE WITH THAT APPROACH THE EIGHT TO SUPPLANT EXISTING INVESTMENTS WE INTERPRET THAT AS IT NEEDING TO BE ADDITIVE -- SO REALLY WANTING TO ENCOURAGE THAT. IN ALONG THAT SAME VEIN TWO YEARS AGO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS -- THERE WAS AN ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED THE NATURAL RESOURCES PRESERVATION AND PARKS PRESERVATION FUND -- WHICH STARTED THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT YOU KNOW WANTING TO DO PAY AS YOU GO APPROACH IS TO THE FUNDING THESE KINDS OF THINGS. AND W'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THE VERY SAME KINDS OF THINGS WHETHER THAT'S AS SENATOR MCGUIRE RAISED THE ISSUE THE COAST COMMISSION STAFFING LEVELS -- TO ENSURE THAT THERE THE READY IN AND ABLE TO AN TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE THE LEVEL RISE IT CETERA -- OR THE COSTA CONSERVANCY TO CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS THEY HAVE BEEN DOING -- OR STATE PARKS YOU KNOW THE ADDITIONAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING GAP NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED OF ANGELINE AND THEN THIS MIGHT BE. THE THE BEGINNING OF THAT CONVERSATION AND THIS YEAR WE KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT WE CAN CONTEMPLATE. TURNED TO BE PUTTING TOWARDS THESE -- IMPORTANT PRIORITIES -- AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR FOR DFW -- AS WE KNOW SIGMA IS FEEL LIKE. A DFW NEEDS TO BE AT THE TABLE TO BE ABLE TO ANALYZE AND PROVIDE. INPUT ON ALL THESE -- GSA THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED THE TO INCLUDE DFW LAND -- WHETHER THEY BE WILDLIFE PRESERVES ETCETERA -- AND CURRENTLY THE ONLY HAVE ONE P. ONE FOR THAT SO WANTING TO SEE YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS BE MADE AVAILABLE.
