TO ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE OFFICE. OF MISTER WHITE CASKET. ARM ON THE FISCAL IMPACT BECAUSE WE ARE THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE I UNDERSTAND THAT EACH PAGE OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVES COULD COST EIGHTY THOUSAND. EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY TO SPEED SAID. WHAT I'M CONCERNED WHICH IS THE SECRETARY STATES ESTIMATE THAT IT'S GONNA BE AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FROM GENERAL FUNDS ANSWER READ THE STAFF REPORT. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT NEW REPLENISHED EXISTING REGISTRATION CARDS. AND I'M WONDERING WHY. BECAUSE I'M I'M SAYING WE HAVE. IF WE MAKING NEW. CARDS I GET THAT AND YOU CAN PUT IN WILL YOU BE EIGHTEEN BY ELECTION DAY AND ALL THAT. BUT THE EXISTING REGISTRATION CARDS IF WE HONOR THEM THERE'S NO REASON TO DUMP. AND SPEND A QUARTER MILLION BUCKS A NEW CARDS. WONDER IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHY. THAT IS A NECESSARY COST IN THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. THIS STAYS OFF IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I THINK THAT WAS- OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION IF THERE WERE. ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS BUT MY SENSE OF THIS IS. THAT THIS COULD BE BUILT INTO THE EXISTING PROCESS SEES. IN THERE WOULD BE MINIMAL COST FRANKLY IF ANY. BECAUSE THE REGISTRATION PROCESS WE'RE NOT ADDING AN ADDITIONAL LAYER FOR EXAMPLE TO THESE THESE COSTS. THE EXISTING FORMS- WOULD BE APPLICABLE WE ALREADY HAVE A PRE REGISTRATION PROCESS FOR SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS- THE MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE TO DO THIS. EASILY AND WE DO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING OVER OVER TWENTY ACTUALLY NEARLY HALF OF THE STATE'S HAVING DONE THIS ALREADY IT'S IT PASSES CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER. UP CALIFORNIA JUST LATE TO THE GAME ON THIS ONE- AND IT'S A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE ON PRE REGISTRATION AND THE COST FRANKLY IS. A NON ISSUE.

AT THIS MOMENT WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD TO MIKE MISTER HILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THE YOU KNOW THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND GOOD RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OUR HOUSES BECAUSE THIS IS KIND OF A HYBRID APPROACH WITH A NUMBER OF MEASURES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN A C. ELEVEN THAT KIND OF BRING TOGETHER. I THINK THE PERFECT SOLUTION TO WHAT WE TRY TO DO IN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS PROVIDE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR THE FOR FIREFIGHTERS FOR THE OTHERS PUBLIC SAFETY AND FIRST RESPONDERS THAT TO PROVIDE SUCH GREAT SERVICE TO US SECONDLY CLOSEST SOME LOOPHOLES THAT WE FIND IN THE- IN. THE CURRENT SYSTEM- AN APPROACH THAT CERTAINLY GOT MY ATTENTION EARLY ON WHEN PEOPLE REALLY ABUSE THE SYSTEM AND PROVIDE- THAT- OR ACTUALLY TAKING MONEY IN KEEPING THE REVENUE THAT'S NECESSARY AND IT'S JUST AN- UNEQUAL AND UNFAIR IN THE WAY OF HAS BEEN. APPROACHED IT AND ALSO THE ASPECT OF BEING ABLE TO RESOLVE A PROBLEM OR AN INITIATIVE THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED WHEN THIS CAN BE. ALLOW FOR THE CONVERSATION THE DISCUSSION AND THE COMPROMISE THIS NECESSARY TO PLAY SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT THAT DOES SO MUCH MORE. THAN WAS ORIGINALLY ATICIPATED SO I JUST THINK THIS IS A GREAT- pGREAT WORK AND- WAS SENATOR HERTZBERG WAS WORKING HARD ON THIS. AS WELL AS IT IS YOURSELF- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN AND- THE STAFF FROM OF FROM BOTH HOUSES TO COME TOGETHER ON THIS THIS GREAT COMPROMISE OR JUST. HONORED TO BE A PART OF IT AND- CERTAINLY HONORED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE RESTORE CAST. AM HE WOULDN'T BE YOU WON'T YOU KNOW I GET THE SPIN SAY ON REVENUE FROM THE ON SECONDHOMES SO YOU CAN'T TAKE YOUR PROP THIRTEEN AND GO UP AND GET A CABIN OR WE WHAT WE USED TO CALL CAP AND THE CONCERN IS THE SECOND PART. THAT THE ALLEY **** CALCULATES THE NET LOSS FROM ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD THAT ARE GOING TO BE TRANSFERRING PROPERTY AND NOT PAYING THE PROP. THE D. INCREASE VALUE TO PROPERTY TAX THAT YOU DO RIGHT NOW- IN I GUESS THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS THE- XCELERATED IMPACT ON THE- WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF. A LOT OF HIGH VALUED HOUSES THAT ARE IN THE BAY AREA- LOS ANGELES THE PEOPLE WOULD SELL AND MOVE UP INTO- AN AREA THAT'S ALREADY STRESS WITH WITH DEVELOPMENT- OR AT LEAST SOME OF US WOULD WOULD SAY SO. THE BUT THEY'RE TALKING THAT THE LAW THE IMPACTIS GOING TO BE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE LOCAL- SCHOOLS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT OVER YEARS. HOW DO YOU BALANCE OFF THOSE. THOSE THOSE TWO PRESSURES WHEN I SEE CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE THAT THAT'S THAT'S EASY TO GET IN BUT THE PRESSURE ON. WE ALREADY HAVE PRESSURE BECAUSE OF THE FIRE FIGHTING IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE SPENDING TO TRY TO SUPPRESS FIRE NETWORK ADDING. AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO THESE. SHOWS VIEW FULL AREAS THERE IS A- A NET GAIN OF UP TO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OVER TIME. BEAT THE INCREASE COMES IN THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS. I BELIEVE THAT- COUNTIES WILL BE MADE WHOLE PROP NINETY A GUARANTEE THAT CAT SCHOOLS WILL BE APPROPRIATELY FUNDED THERE WON'T BE AT A LOSS THERE THE FORMULA IS A COMPLICATED ONE BUT IF- THE FOR THE ON THE PROPERTY TAX PORTABILITY PROVISION THE SCENE OVER FIFTY FIVE WHEN THEY MOVED TO A NEW RESIDENTS IF THAT IS. OF GREATER VALUE THEY WILL ACTUALLY BE PAYING A MODEST ABOUT MORE IN PROPERTY TAXES. BUT IT'S REALLY THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS AND FREEING UP THOSE PROPERTIES THAT ADDRESSES THE AVAILABLE AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING STOCK ISSUE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THERE IS A PROJECTED NET GAIN BUT IT IS IT IS COMPLICATED BECAUSE THERE'S LOSSES IN SOME COLUMNS. GAINS IN THE OTHER COLUMN BUT IT NETS OUT UP TO A BILLION A YEAR IN THIS FUNDS UNDER FIND HISTORICALLY UNDERFUNDED FIRE DISTRICTS SO THAT'S A THAT'S A VALUABLE PORTION OF THIS BUT IT ALSO- MAKE SURE THAT COUNTIES ARE HELD HARMLESS. IN ANY TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THERE WILL BE NO- I'D NET LOSS CELL I'M CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL. GENERATE UP TO BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE BUT- WHAT DREW ME TO THIS WAS THAT TAX FAIRNESS HE'S VERY HONESTLY OF THIS WITH THE SECOND THIRD FOURTH HOMES THAT ARE USED AS- VACATION PROPERTIES. THEIR USE HAS RENTAL PROPERTIES SO ESSENTIALLY YOU CAN INHERIT THE SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH HOMES BUT YOU CAN IT HURT THE TAX RATE. SO THAT IS WHAT DREW ME TO THIS MEASURE. AND THE FORMULA CAN GET TECHNICAL AND CAN GET COMPLICATED IF KERR HAS ANYTHING TO ADD SPECIFIC TO THE QUESTION AROUND. THE PROPERTY TAX PORTABILITY AND HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE ACTUALLY GENERATING. NEW REVENUES I I'D WALK A MILE IN HIS CALM AS WELL. IF. TWO ANOS WORKS WHERE ALL THE ACT. HI YEAH BUT A SIMILAR I CAN SPEAK TO THAT QUICKLY COLONEL- YES WORKS WERE ON BEHALF OF THE REALTORS ASSOCIATION. ORDER THE EQUALIZATION DOES TRACKING DATA ON THE NUMBER OF THESE- PROPERTY TAX BASE TRANSIT OCCUR NOW OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IT'S AVERAGE FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWELVE PER YEAR. OBVIOUSLY THAT NUMBER WILL GROW UNDER THIS MEASURE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IS IT. OR OR TRIPLE- IT IT'S HARD TO TELL- BUT EVEN EVEN IF THE DOUBLING OR TRIPLING WHICH WE COULD SEE NEXT ORDINARY. THE STAFF ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT THE AVERAGE WILL PROPERTY TAX LOSS ON THE REPLACEMENT HOME IS FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS PER YEAR PER HOME. SO WHAT THE CURRENT RATE OF FORTY SIX HUNDRED TRANSFERS PER YEAR AT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR LOT THAT'S A LITTLE OVER SEVEN DOLLARS SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR STATEWIDE. IN PROPERTY TAX LOSSES. THE NUMBER THE NUMBER OF CANCER DOUBLES OR TRIPLES ARE LOOKING AT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE IN REVENUE REDUCTION ALL THAT COMPONENT BASED ON THE NUMBERS. IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS IN BASED ON THE HISTORICAL DATA COLUMBIA WE ON THE NUMBER OF TRANSFERS OF THE PROPERTY BASE. I THINK IT'S ALL IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT. WELL THERE WILL BE LESS PROPERTY TAX PAID ON THE REPLACEMENT HOLDEN THERE MIGHT OTHERWISE BE. SOLD TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T TRANSFER THE PROPERTY TAX BASE. THE ORIGINAL HOME OF THE OF THE INDIVIDUAL BY IN THE REPLACEMENT. HAVE TO BE SOLD UNDER THE RULES YOU CAN'T. WHAT WE CALL YOUR YOUR PROPERTY TAX BASE TO A NEW HOME UNLESS YOU SELL YOUR ORIGINAL OUT. AND WHEN THE ORIGINAL HOME IS SOLD IT'S GOING TO BE SOLD FOR. MORE THAN THEM IN THE BASE YOUR VALUES CAN BE SOBER FOR MARKET VALUE WHICH IS ALMOST ALWAYS MORE SOTHERE'S GOING TO BE. A PROPERTY TAX INCREASE ON THE ORIGINAL- SO THESE NUMBERS BEGIN OFFSET EACH OTHER THEY'LL BE. COURSE THE LESSER TAX PAID THAT MIGHT. OTHERWISE BE ON THE REPLACEMENT BUT THEY'LL BE MORE TAX PAID ON THE ORIGINAL HOME WHEN THE WHEN THE OLDER SELLS IT TO BOOT. SHOULDERS ACOSTA DOWN THERE I THINK YOU KNOW FOR. BASED ON THE NUMBERS AND STAFF REPORT FOR EVERY FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS LOSS ON A REPLACEMENT ON THE PROPERTY TAX WILL BE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS EUGENE. WHEN THIS WHEN THE ORIGINAL MISSILE. AND I THINK IT'S A REMEMBER MULLIN POINTED OUT THAT YOU DEPENDING ON WHERE THE HOMEOWNER CELLS ARE HOME AND- IN WHAT COUNTY THAT THAT IS LOCATED. AND WHAT COUNTY THEY MOVED TO THE TRANSMITTER PROPERTY. TAX BASE. NO THAT HAD BEEN SOME CONCERN OUR DATA THE OTHER REAL. SOLUTION TO KATE THERE WILL NEVER BE A NET. COUNTY TO LACKEY NOT LAWSUIT. BUT THE COMPROMISE HERE AND IN THE PROTECT YOUR AGE ELEVEN. IT CAN AMERICAN THAT THAT. THE REPORT THERE EVERY IN THE COUNTY THE EXPERIENCE OF THEIR REVENUE LAW. IT WILL BE WHOLE TO THE- IN THE COUNTY REVERIE PROTECT UNDER IS INCLUDE IN THIS. OCELOT BUT THAT IS HOW THE WE THINK THAT THE REGULAR SET OF COURT OF WELL NOW BE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL LIKELY OFFICE. BY A STATEWIDE. BECAUSE OF THE OVER HOMES RICH BOX SO AND REASSESS. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER MR HELL COMMITTEE CHAIR THE IN ALL. A YOU LOOK AT THE I THINK THE PORT. OF THE PROPERTY TAXES KIND OF THAT THAT TRAIN LEFT THE STATION. THAT INITIATIVE THAT WILLBE ON THE BALLOT IS THAT A POPULAR ISSUE AND IT WOULD PROBABLY. PASSED IN NOVEMBER AND- IN THAT WOULD BE- WE HAVE THAT AS WELL BUT WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF BETTER THINGS I BELIEVE IS THAT PART OF THIS PACKAGE THAT COME TOGETHER THE SECOND THING IS. THEIR NUMBER OF COUNTIES ARE IN THE BAY AREA FIVE AT LEAST COUNTY THAT ALREADY ALLOW FOR THAT FOR AVAILABILITY AND THESE ARE VERY WEALTHY HI A HOT HOUSE SHOULDN'T PROPERTY VALUED COMMUNITIES THAT- THAT ALREADY HAVE THAT SO IT'S A- NOT MUCH OF A LOSS THERE. WELL ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MS BATES THE JOKER. HI I'M DO WE HAVE A FILE ON THIS WE HAVE A RESPONSE FROM% INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA- OR FRANCHISED APARTMENT OF FINANCE DOES NOT HAVE A FILE ON THIS BILL. IT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC ON ON A BILL LIKE THIS. CASE ONE REGISTER THAT- A COMPLAINT. THESE ARE THE FOLKS LIKE SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL ISSUE FOR THE- STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION. AND IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF THE PROPERTIES GOING FORWARD. WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME NOT IN OUR CHAMBERS HERE ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE IF. IT COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING ON THE SECOND TRANSFER OF AN INHERITED PIECE OF PROPERTY. FOR A FOR A NEW BUYER. WHILE WAITING YEAR INCREASING THE PROPERTY TAX LIKE THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE. MOVING INTO THE HOMES- AND I'M I'M THINKING ABOUT. OF THE IN MY PART OF THE WORLD DOWN THERE- THE MEDIAN PRICE FOR HOMES ALONG THE CLOSER OVER A MILLION DOLLARS ON OR TO. OUR LOOKING OUT MEDIAN HOME PRICES AND- BUT FATAL GONNA BEACH. AND YOU HAVE A VARIETY THERE ARE THERE ARE HUGE EVEN IF IT FOR A- THREE BEDROOM HOUSE WITH WITH THE BATHROOM. THE ONLY NO YARDS SO. I JUST THINK THERE SHOULD BE WAY MORE FISCAL ANALYSIS WE HAVE A REAL HANDLE ON. WITH THEIR DAY IF HE IS AN IMPACT TO AFFORDABILITY. THOUGHT IN A STATE THAT'S ALREADY VERY HIGH ON PROPERTY TAX AND OTHER COST OF LIVING IN THE ABILITY. REALLY TO MOVE ABOUT COMMUNITIES AND MOVE UP. OF FROM A STARTER HOME OUT TO A LARGER ONE TO ACCOMMODATE FAMILY OR- YOU KNOW- RELATIVES WHATEVER. SO THAT WOULD BE MY CONCERN WITH THEM. THE MATCH DEEP DIVE IN TERMS OF THE REAL. IMPACT TO. FAMILY AND AFFORDABILITY FOR RESIDENTS I IN OUR. STATE ROBBIE I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO. IT TODAY. THANK YOU. ANYBODY UP MR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RESTAURANT AT A JUST THE LET YOU KNOW THAT THEIR SOME THINGS IN HERE THAT I REALLY DO SUPPORT OBVIOUSLY THE TAX PORTABILITY. IS A GOOD IDEA AND BEING ABLE TO- ALLOWING IN THOSE TEN COUNTIES THAT RECIPROCATE ITH THAT NOW- REQUIRING ALL FIFTY COUNTIES TO DO THAT I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA IT WILL CREATE I BELIEVE. MOVEMENT IN THE IN THE MARKET THE HOUSING MARKET WILL I THINK HELP. MORE HOUSES COME UP FOR SALE THAT. THE LONG TERM WOULDN'T. I'M I'M ALSO YOU KNOW IS THIS MIGHT BE SHOCKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THE- THESE. ROB PARENT CHILD. EXCLUSION A AYE AYE EVEN THOUGH I GET TO TAKE ADVANTAGE THAT ONCE I NEVER REALLY KIND UNDERSTOOD WHY THAT WAS PART OF PROP THIRTEEN- INTO SOME NOT COMPLETELY CLOSE MINDED TO THAT IDEA THERE'S JUST SOME OTHER THINGS IN THE BILL THAT I IN IN ADDITION TO WHAT- CENTER BATES SAID THEY KIND OF GIVE ME SOME PAUSE ON THIS PARTICULAR FULL PACKAGE BUT I DID SHE DID ONE LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN THERE THAT I LIKE AND SOME OTHER THINGS I'M OPEN MINDED TO SOME.
