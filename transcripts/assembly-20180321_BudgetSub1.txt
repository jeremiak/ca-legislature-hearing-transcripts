TODAY SUB ONE HEARING ON AND WE WILL START WITH ISSUE ONE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING. I COULD HAVE THE FIRST PANEL COME FORWARD WHENEVER YOU'RE READY DOOR FOR CONFLICT. SO GOOD AFTERNOON I'M LARA CONLEY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING WHICH I BECAUSE TO GO AHEAD TO EVER AFFECT MONEY. STEVEN TRADUCTION. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DEAN FUJIMOTO CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING DEPUTY DIRECTOR. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JOE RODRIGUEZ CALIFORNIA STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN. LOUISE BOURGEOIS DEPARTMENT FINANCE. LIAM OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JACKIE BURROUGHS CO ILIO. AND LET ME JUST PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES. A TWO HUNDRED AND ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. IN OF FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING THIRTY FOUR MILLION UP THAT. IS IN GENERAL FUND. AS THE DESIGNATED STATE UNIT ON TEACHING THE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTERS A VARIETY OF OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS. BOMB PROVIDING COMMUNITY SERVICES. UNDER THOSE PROGRAMS AND OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE COUNSELING AND ADVOCACY PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO ADMINISTERS TO MEDI CAL PROGRAMS HOME COMMITTEE BASED MEDICAL PROGRAMS THE MULTIPURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAMS WE REFER TO AS THAT MISSISSIPPI. A AND THE COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES PROGRAM SEA BASS. APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CTA'S. FUNDING COMES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF OUR OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS THE REMAINING GENERAL FUND IS FOR OUR MATCH. FOR THAT FEDERAL FUNDING. AND IN LOOKING BACK BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN PRIMARILY THAT FEDERAL FUNDING HAS REMAINED CONSTANT AND FLAT. OVERALL IN TERMS OF OUR OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS HOWEVER IF THE SENIOR EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM AT OUR TOOK A SIX PERCENT CUT OVER THAT TIME PERIOD. AND THE HEALTH INSURANCE COUNSELING ADVOCACY PROGRAM HIGH CAP. ON TOOK A TWENTY PERCENT REDUCTION. ON IN THEIR FUNDING. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF A FEDERAL BUDGET AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNDER THE CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS WE KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED FUND. ON ACTION EFFORTS OCCURRING. AS WE SPEAK. THIS IS OUR FIFTH CONTINUING RESOLUTION. AND THAT. THAT EXPIRES ON FRIDAY SO WE REMAIN CAUTIOUSLY HOPEFUL IN TERMS OF THAT. THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSED LEVEL FUNDING FOR MOST OF THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS. A HOWEVER THE HEALTH INSURANCE LIKE CAP PROGRAM. AND NIGHT OF SENIOR EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM WOULD BE ELIMINATED UNDER THAT BUDGET. SO WE. THAT THAT'S THAT'S A PROPOSAL. ON ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I KNOW WAS REFERENCED. IN THE AGENDA EXTENSIVELY IN A NUMBER OF THE CHARTS ON THAT WERE INCLUDED ARE FROM OUR STATE PLAN ON AGING. AND THAT COVERS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. BOB THE WAY WE'VE ORGANIZED THAT PLAN. FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO IS THAT WE INCLUDE AN INTRODUCTORY SECTION THAT REALLY LOOKS BROADLY AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE SOCIO DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. TRENDS THAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF THE AGING OF THE POPULATION. AND I THINK THAT'S VERY HELPFUL FOR ALL A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS. IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO PREPARING CONCRETE TO GATHER DATA THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL IN IN IN ONE LOCATION BUT THE REMAINDER OF THE PLAN ALMOND ORCHARDS COMPONENT OF IT. I'M REALLY IS A DOCUMENT THAT WE NEED TO PREPARE TO RECEIVE OUR FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON AGING. AND. SO WE DO SO. LOOKING AT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE CURRENTLY OPERATE. AREAS WHERE WE GET RECEIVE GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE ACTION ON. AS WELL AS AREAS THAT WE THINK. YOU KNOW NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT WE DO SO THERE. BUT DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS DO PLANS FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES TO FUTURE PLANS. OUR PLAN WE DO WITH THE INTENT THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ACTUALLY COMPLETE THOSE ACTIVITIES. SO THEY'RE NOT JUST. KIND OF AMBITIOUS PLANS THAT WERE THEN TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR FUNDING FOR WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT BY AND LARGE BASED ON WHERE THINGS ARE AT THAT POINT IN TIME. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THOSE ALTHOUGH I MUST SAY WE ALWAYS ADD A FEW LITTLE ASPIRATIONAL. ITEMS THAT WE THINK ARE WITHIN OUR REACH. IT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD PLAN WITHOUT THAT AS WELL. THE OUR FEDERAL FUNDING COMES TO WAS AS A GRANT A IT IS NOT AND PROPORTIONATE I KNOW YOU'VE GOT THAT. WONDERFUL CHART IN YOUR AGENDA IN TERMS OF THE GROWTH OF THE POPULATION. IT DOES NOT COME YOU KNOW AS THE POPULATION GOES UP. OR FIND FUNDING DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE IN RELATION TO THAT POPULATION IT'S ONE OF THE FACTORS. IN TERMS OF HOW THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO STATES BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE INVOLVED AND HOW THOSE THOSE FUNDS COME TO WAS AT THE STATE LEVEL. THEN I JUST WAS GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON IN TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT TWO OF THE OUR OUR MAJOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE OF PARTICULAR I THINK. I'M INTERESTING DISCUSSION TODAY CERTAINLY THE SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAM. A IS OUR LARGEST OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAM. AND VERY VERY WELL KNOWN AND PAGE TWELVE SHOWS THE CURRENT FUNDING FOR BOTH THE HOME DELIVERED AND NOT CONGREGATE NUTRITION PROGRAMS BEFORE HAVE YOU MOVE ON CERTAIN ISSUE ONE I MADE.

HOME FIFTH OF MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA'S OLDER. PEOPLE HAS GROWN BY TWO HUNDRED BY TWO MILLION IN THAT TIME. ON THIS FLAT FUNDING HAS RESULTED IN INADEQUATE CAPACITY UNLIMITED ACCESS ON HEALTH DISPARITIES IN OUR COUNTY IN SPITE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT STEPPING UP AND PUTTING THEIR FAIR SHARE F FUNDING. A FEW INTO SERVICES WE CANNOT MEET THE NEED ARMED. IT'S TODAY WERE ASKING THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO UNDER THE FLAT FUNDING.

THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SERVE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE WHEN I JOINED THE ADULT DAY HEALTHCARE MODEL TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE FOUND THAT OUR EXPENSES HAVE REASON BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF CARE THAT THESE FOLKS OR ARE REQUIRING THE MEDICAL CARE AND THEY EMPLOYMENT COSTS OF HAVING. A MULTI PROFESSIONAL STAFF TO CARE FOR THEM IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES DIGNITY AND RESPECT. I I REALLY HONESTLY ASK YOU TO TAKE ACTION TODAY FOR BECAUSE THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF THE PAST IT WE ARE NOW LIVING IN THAT RIPPLE EFFECT. AND THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF THE FUTURE DEPENDS ON THE DECISIONS WE MAKE TODAY THE CARE FOR OUR CITIZENS AS THEY AGE IN PLACE IN OUR COMMUNITY ADULT DAY HEALTHCARE SEA BASS. NEEDS AN INCREASE IN FUNDING IN ORDER FOR US TO CARE FOR THE NUMBERS TODAY AND THE NUMBERS IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. JUST A QUICK WAY TO THE SUCH ON POINT CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE WERE FULL SUPPORT. OF THE APOSTLE HERE JUST WANNA MAKE THAT CLEAR THANK YOU. CLAY CAMP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE AREA AGENCY ON AGING OF SANTA CRUZ AND SAN BENITO COUNTIES IN. JUST ONE QUICK POINT THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME STATEWIDE PLANS IN PROCESS AT LEAST BEING DEVELOPED ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THE ARE. THIS RAPID INCREASE OF THE AGING POPULATION AND YOU KNOW I THINK ALL OF US HERE WERE ALWAYS SO FOCUSED ON WHAT'S IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF US. THAT WE FORGET THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT NEXT YEAR TO THREE YEARS OUT SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT THANK YOU SIR. AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RAY CANSINO MESSY รณ COMMUNITY BRIDGES HOW WE OPERATE ELDER DAY A SEA BASS PROGRAM IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WE SEEM THIRTY PERCENT OF SEA BASS PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE CLOSED DOWN. WE ARE THIS WE WERE THE SECOND OF ORGANIZATION IN THE STATE TO GO TO OUR MANAGED CARE ARM AND ACTUALLY ASPIRIN INCREASE WE RAISE THE THIRTY PERCENT. AND THAT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH OUR EMPLOYEES ARE OUR ENDS OUR DOCTORS OR PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE PAID UNDER MARKET. OF THE REALITY IS THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS NOT SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO ONE KEEP THE DEMAND OF THE MANDATES OF BASIC SERVICE. TO REALLY KEEP UP WITH DEMAND OF OUR CURRENT MARKET AND THREE TO KEEP THE BASS OPEN ACROSS THE STATE. THE REALITY IS IS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO TALK TO OUR MANAGED CARE PROVIDER. AND GET SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THREE COUNTY SAN BENITO ARM I MEAN SORRY MONTEREY AND MERCED AND SANTA CRUZ COUNTY WERE NOT. ALL COUNTIES ALL COUNTIES DON'T PARTNER THE SAME WAY WITH MANAGED CARE. ORGANIZATIONS AND THE REALITY IS THAT YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY. ARE TO ENSURE THATYOU TRY TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE ARM AND DO IT FOR THE STATE SET THINKING. NEW CHAIR MY NAME IS SIMEON GANT AND I REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA BLACKOUT NETWORK. AND WE ARE HERE OF IN SUPPORT OF THE FUNDING INCREASE AND SPECIFICALLY ON THE NUTRITION ISSUE. LOOKING AT THEM ON OUR COMMUNITIES AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE LIVING REALLY I'M HEAVILY AND WILL BE CALLED FOOD DESERTS AND WITH THIS INCREASE IN NUTRITION WE WILL BE ABLE TO. ASSIST WITH OUR. COMMUNITIES ARE WITH FOOD NUTRITION AGING I'M ALSO WITH THE ALZHEIMER'S ISSUE A WE ALSO SUPPORT THAT SPECIFICALLY OF THE PROPOSAL SAYS HERE THIS. A DISPARITY DISPARITY IN ALZHEIMER'S OUGHT TO SPORTS DISK WHO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WHERE PREVALENT RATES ARE ALZHEIMER'S ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GET DIAGNOSIS OF THE DISEASE LACKS BEHIND THAT OF WHITE AMERICANS AND WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE AND FOR THAT REASON WE ARE ON ONE OF THE ON RECORD IN SUPPORT OF THAT? THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ONE I'LL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS. FIRST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THE BACKGROUND ON AGING PROGRAMS AND THE RECENT FEDERAL REDUCTIONS. FOR THE DEPARTMENT I WANNA GET AN UNDERSTANDING WAS THEIR CONTEMPLATION WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT BACK FILLING THE FEDERAL CUTS. AND SECOND QUESTION IS HOW DO THE PROGRAMS IN YOUR VIEW ALIGNED WITH OR NOT WITH THE VISION GOALS AND. OBJECTIVES SET FORTH IN THE STATE PLAN ON AGING. OF IN TERMS OF THE FEDERAL CUTS AT THIS POINT. THE THE THE ACTUAL REALIZE CUTS WERE IN THE TITLE FIVE IN THE ON THE HIGH CAP PROGRAM. FORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA. COM WELL IT'S A IT'S A MIXED A A MIXED RESPONSE. OUR FEDERAL FUNDING EQUATES TO ABOUT FORTY ONE PERCENT OF OUR FUNDING WE ALSO RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. AND MANAGED HEALTHCARE PLANS THAT MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS TO HELP SUPPORT THE HIGH CAP PROGRAM AND TO THAT EXTENT WE ARE MORE FORTUNATE THAN SOME OTHER STATES THAT RELY SOLELY ON THE FEDERAL. ON HIGH CAP FUNDS SO WE AND YOU KNOW OUR. OUR. HOPEFULLY OPTIMISTIC BASED ON ADVOCACY AMONG MANY ORGANIZATIONS. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF CONGRESS. ATTA IN AND AND WHERE THE SENDS UP BOMB YOU KNOW IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. ARM ON THESE PROGRAMS THEY HAVE BEEN BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS UNFORTUNATELY REPEATEDLY OVER THE YEARS EITHER A HOUSE OR THE SENATE SEEMS TO PUT THEM UP FOR. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE RESTORED THEM SO. TWO ONE WEEK TEACH CONTINUE TO KIND OF OPERATE IN THAT MODE AND. ADAM. AND AND BE HELPFUL. THE SECOND QUESTION IS REALLY TRYING TO GET AT THE STATE PLAN ON AGING MEANS TO UNDERSTAND. NON. WHETHER IN YOUR VIEW WE'VE ALIGNED OR NOT WITH THOSE STATED OBJECTIVES. SO OUR OWN OBJECTIVES IN TERMS OF NUTRITION FOR THE STATE PLAN. HAVE REALLY FOCUSED ON. LOOKING AT AREAS WHERE WE SEE THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. TO LOOK AT HOW WE WE MIGHT BETTER INCOME THE COLLABORATE BETTER. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS WE ACTUALLY IN TERMS OF OUR OVERALL DEMOGRAPHICS REACH A VERY HIGH LEVEL MOST FIFTY PERCENT. OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS ARE LOW INCOME. MINORITIES ARM. AT AND NOT SURPRISINGLY OF COURSE A HIGH PERCENTAGE. OUR OUR WOMEN. SO WE ARE MEETING OUR FEDERAL TARGETS WELL BUT WE THINK THEY'RE STILL OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER AND IDENTIFY WAYS IN WHICH. INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE LIMITED ENGLISH ACCESS ON FEEL THE BAY OR HAVE EXPERIENCED DISCRIMINATION EARLIER IN THEIR LIFE CAN BE ENCOURAGED IN AND ENGAGED AND. BOTH BOTH PARTICIPATING IN THE NUTRITION PROGRAM AND THE OTHER SERVICES THAT THE AREA AGENCIES PROVIDE AND I THINK THERE CERTAINLY AREAS THE STATE YOU KNOW BASED ON DEMOGRAPHICS. WHERE THE AREA AGENCIES HAVE REALLY DEVELOPED SOME UNIQUE? TOOLS FOR DOING THAT SUCCESSFULLY AND ARE YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IS TO HELP CROSS FERTILIZE. ON THOSE STRATEGIES UGH ACROSS OUR NETWORK. I'M JUST GONNA PUT IN MY TWO CENTS CONCERT FROM A MORE RURAL AREA I'M ALWAYS GAS WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE EQUALLY SERVED YES. IT SOMETIMES IT'S HARDER FOR US TO ACCESS SERVICES BECAUSE OF NEEDING TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES BUT. ANY EFFORT YOU CAN HAVE WOULD BE GREAT. WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN. ON THIS PENDING THE MAY REVISION AND ARE CLOSE AT HEARINGS AND WITH THAT WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. I THINK. I MAY NEED TO CREATE SOME SPACE AT THE TABLE IF I CAN FOR CLAY CAM. AND DAVID MORE COLOR. AND WE WILL START WITH CLAY AND THEN GO ON TO DAVID. GOOD AFTERNOON CLAY CAMP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF. THE AREA AGENCY ON AGING OF SANTA CRUZ AND SAN BENITO COUNTIES AND ALSO CALIFORNIA SO SHE SENATE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING LEGISLATIVE CO CHAIR. SO REGARDING THE BUDGET AUGMENTATION THERE SOME ARM BACKGROUND AND AND REAL. CRITICAL REASONS WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR THIS. I IN THE PAST DECADE STATE FUNDS FOR AGING PROGRAMS FOR OLDER AMERICANS ACT IN ALL THE CALIFORNIA ZACH PROGRAMS. HAVE DECREASED BYMORE THAN FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT. AND IN THAT SAME TIME WE'VE SEEN THE POPULATION INCREASED BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT INFLATION GOES OUT SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE INCREASED NEED AND DECREASE RESOURCES WHICH KIND OF CREATES. AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION AND I THINK. AND THAT'S KIND OF SHOWN BY CURRENTLY THERE'S ALMOST ONE POINT THREE MILLION NUTRITIONALLY AT RISK SENIORS IN THE STATE. PEOPLE AT THE THREAT OF GOING HUNGRY TODAY. TOMORROW OR DAY AFTER TOMORROW. THE SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS ARE GREAT AT SERVING THOSE PEOPLE HOWEVER WERE ONLY SERVING ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION RIGHT NOW. SO THERE'S A MILLION SENIORS AT RISK OF NOT BEING SERVED. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY CRISIS. ARM FLAT FUNDING ALSO WAS IT IS AN ISSUE THAT CONTINUES TO DAMAGE THE PROGRAM EACH YEAR THE COST OF THE MEAL GOES UP ABOUT A QUARTER PER YEAR. WHICH ISN'T A WHOLE LOT IT'S MORE THAT IT'S LESS THAN INFLATION BUT IT'S REALITY THAT THE PROGRAM SPACE. SO IF WERE FLAT FUNDED THAT EQUATES TO TWELVE HUNDRED FEWER MEALS FOUR VULNERABLE SENIOR PER DAY IN THE STATE. THAT'S THE COSTA PLAYS OUT BECAUSE SO MANY MEALS ARE CURRENTLY SYRUP. SO WE REALLY WANT TO URGE ARM THIS COMMITTEE TO FULLY SUPPORT THIS BUDGET ON INTUITION. I'M WE'VE HAD. GREAT SUCCESS IN KEEPING THOSE COSTS LOW THERE'S THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS THE DELIVER THE SERVICES OF PROBABLY NO PROGRAM IN THE STATE THAT USES THE MANY VOLUNTEERS THIS BUT. I'M YOU KNOW LOOKING AT ALL THE AGING PROGRAMS I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING MORE BASIC MORE SUCCESSFUL AND MORE CRITICAL THAN ACTUALLY SERVING SOMEBODY. A NUTRITIOUS MEAL EVERY DAY. AND IT HAS A HUGE AMOUNT OF COST SAVINGS IN TERMS OF AVOIDING OTHER MORE EXPENSIVE INTERVENTIONS HEALTHCARE EMERGENCY USE WORTH. USE ARM CRITICAL DISEASES ALL THOSE GO OP WHEN SOMEBODY'S NUTRITIONALLY AT RISK HER ARE NUTRITIONALLY SUFFERING. SO WE KNOW THERE'S A COST BENEFIT OF THIS. ARM IT'S HARD TO GET THE EXACT NUMBERS BUT IT'S SOMETHING WILL BE MEETING WITH A A CF WITH THE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE BENEFITS AND CRUNCHING NUMBERS SO WE CAN TELL YOU YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS YOU PAY FOR AND HOW MUCH YOU SAVE AS A RESULT OF IT. ON THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN GREAT IN RECENT YEARS I THINK EVERY YEAR THE COMMITTEE HAS RECOMMENDED AUGMENTED FUNDING FOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT. HOWEVER WIN THE ISSUE GOES TO CONFERENCE COMMITTEE OR GOES TO DISCUSSION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WERE WALKING AWAY WITH NO DOLLARS. SO WE'RE REALLY ASKING YOU GUYS NOT TO TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER THIS YEAR WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL ALL THE PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO SHRINK AND SUFFER. AND YOU KNOW IF NOT NOW WHEN TO SOMETHING HAPPEN THE GROWTH IS ALMOST EXPONENTIAL OF THE OLDER POPULATION AND THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER DECADE. SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A LESSENING OF DEMAND. AND I THINK THIS KIND OF A CHOICE HERE. IF WE DON'T PROVIDE THESE. PREVENTIVE KEEPING PEOPLE INDEPENDENT TYPE PROGRAMS WE END UP WITH MORE EXTENSIVE COST DOWN THE LINE. SO YOU KNOW LIKE IT OR NOT. GROWTH IN THE SENIOR POPULATION IS GOING TO IMPACT THE BUDGET IN A NEGATIVE WAY. AND I THINK WE CAN BE PROACTIVE ABOUT IT AND DECREASE SOME OF THOSE COSTS AND PROVIDE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE OR WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO WHAT THE CURRENT TREND IS WHICH IS NOTHING. AND HOPE THAT HOPE FOR THE BEST AND AND REALLY FINANCIALLY THE ONLY WAY THAT'S GOING TO BE SAVINGS THERE IS IF. A WHOLE LOT OF SENIOR START DYING AT A MUCH FASTER RATE THAN RIGHT NOW AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS THAT SO I'M I'M JUST URGING TO. SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THIS BUDGET REQUEST AND HOPEFULLY SUPPORTED AND SUPPORTIVE TO THE WALL IF YOU CAN. THANK YOU SIR DAVID MARKUPS.

YOU KNOW THAT SERVICES COULDN'T BE TRANSFERRED INTO OTHER AREAS OF FEDERAL ARE FEDERAL GRANT ALLOWS THE AREA AGENCIES TO TRANSFER FUNDS. A PORTION OF TRANSIT OF OF. NUTRITION FUNDS INTO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES SO THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE LANGUAGE GAVE US THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FUNDS WERE REALLY BEING USED COMPLETELY.

I'M VERY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT ALONG WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND. FILIA THANK YOU. TO BERMAN FINANCIALLY ONLY COMES.

OUR A MODEST PROPOSAL THAT SEEKS TO HELP ADDRESS THE EVER GROWING NEEDS OF SENIORS AND OUR STATE THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM THE BASIC ACCESS TO OUR FOOD IN OUR COMMUNITIES. MASLOW HIERARCHY OF NEEDS WITH CLEAR AND IDENTIFYING FOOD ACCESS AND SHELTER THE PRIMARY MOTIVATION AND NEEDS IN HUMANS. BUTTE ACCESS ARE INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH TRANSLATES ITSELF INTO MANY STUDIES LINKING TO THE ARE A FAX OF FOOD IN THE LIKELIHOOD OF SENIOR DEPENDENCE. THAT'S WHY IT IS SO TROUBLING TO FIND RECENT REPORTS SUCH AS THE TWENTY FIFTEEN UCLA HEALTH AND POLICY RESEARCH THAT FINDS ONE IN FIVE SENIORS IN OUR STATE CANNOT AFFORD BASIC NEEDS. AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND ROUGHLY ONE IN SEVEN SENIORS ARE LIVING IN EXTREME POVERTY. THIS IS NOT A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY THIS IS CALIFORNIA THE SIX LARGEST ECONOMY AND WE DESERVE TO DO BETTER. THIS IS NO DOUBT A GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AS WE SEE THE SENIORS BECOMING THE SECOND LARGEST HOMELESS DEMOGRAPHIC AND THE ONE OF THE FASTEST SINGLE GROWING DEMOGRAPHICS. ACROSS THE STATE THEY'RE GOING TO BE FURTHER DEMANDS ON OUR SYSTEMS OF CARE AND WE BEGIN TO SEE THE BABY BOOMER GENERATION BEGIN TO RETIRE. AS WE ALSO SEE THE LARGEST THAT GENERATION. ARE IN SO DOING WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL PENSION THERE SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ACCORDING TO THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF AMERICANS. DON'T HAVE A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT AND LESSEN SIXTEEN PERCENT OF THEM HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN THE NEXT COMING YEARS AS PROJECTIONS OF THE GROWING GROWTH OF SENIORS BEGINS TO COMPOUND THIS ISSUE. WHICH WILL SEE THE INCREASING NUMBERS OF THOSE WHO BUILT OUR GREATEST A STATE.

CAROL SEWELL FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING WERE ALSO COSPONSORED THIS REQUEST. I'D JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THE BENEFITS. TO THE OLDER ADULTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS BOTH CONGREGATE AND HOME DELIVERED. UNTO INK TO HELP ADDRESS SOCIAL ISOLATION. THIS IS AN AREA THAT A LOT OF RESEARCH IS COMING OUT RIGHT NOW IT'S A HUGE FACTOR AND. PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO REMAIN HEALTHY IF THEY HAVE. CONTACTS WITH PEOPLE IF THEY CAN GET TO THE CONGREGATE MEAL SITE. IF SOMEONE IS CHECKING ON THEM WITH THE HOME DELIVERED MEAL. WE THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AS WAS SAID EARLIER THERE'S A VERY LARGE PROPORTION OF THE OLDER ADULT POPULATION THAT IS FOOD INSECURE WE CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO ADDRESS THAT SIXTEEN PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION.

TO A POINTER CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE THE CSL IS IN THE. SUPPORT THIS AUGMENTATION WE BELIEVE NO SENIOR. SHOULD GO HUNGRY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON. TO ALL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. JUST ONE COMMENT I THINK IT AND ADDRESS THE. THE FACT THAT OF PEOPLE FEEL BETTER WHEN SOMEBODY VISITS THEM. I KNOW THAT THAT THEY SHOULD THAT'S A STATISTIC THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN YOUR REPORT BECAUSE WHEN SOME BASED SAY HELLO. I'M A JUST BRIGHTENS OUR DAY AND I THINK AW. IT ALSO CUTS DOWN ON SICKNESSES FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND OF YOU CAN INCLUDE THAT IN YOUR STATISTICS I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE FACT. THANK YOU. WE CAN GET THAT TO THE COMMITTEE. AND I. THAT IT WAS A MOMENT THAT SPARKED ME AS WELL DURING PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT SOCIALIZE ICED ISOLATION. THERE'S A STUDY THAT CAME OUT THIS PAST YEAR THAT SAID LET LONELINESS WAS A WORSE RISK FACTOR THAN OBESITY. AND IT APPLIES TO EVERYONE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. FOR THE ADVOCATES WHO ARE HERE YOU SAID IN YOUR STATEMENT BUT I WANT YOU TO EXPLICITLY ANSWER IF YOU CAN. WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF NO FUNDING INCREASE AND HOW MUCH OF THE SEVENTEEN MILLION IS NECESSARY JUST TO KEEP YOUR CURRENT SERVICE LEVELS? FLAT FUNDING WOULD RESULT IN TWELVE HUNDRED ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED MEALS LAS PER DAY OVER YEAR THAT'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND I'M ROUNDING OFF A FEW THOUSAND BUT. YOU KNOW GENERALLY THAT'S THE IMPACT OF IT. I'M THAT'S TAKEN AN AVERAGE OF BOTH. CONGREGATE DINING CENTERS BECAUSE CONGREGATE DINING CENTER IS A VERY IMPORTANT HOME DELIVERED MEALS. SO IF. I'M I'M FORGETTING WHAT THE OTHER PART OF THE QUESTION WAS THAT THEY HAVEN'T CAN MILLION HOW MUCH OF THAT OUT HOW MUCH THEY'RE A TAPE TO KEEP CURRENTS RIGHT LET'S SO IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT FOUR MILLION TO KEEP SERVICES FLAT. FOR THE DEPARTMENT HOW DOES THIS PROPOSAL ONLINE OR NOT WITH THE STATE PLAN AND. I'M GONNA REFERENCE IT VERY GOOD READING BUT HAD ON AND. ON PAGE THIRTY TWO YOU HAVE OBJECTIVE THREE BE WHAT SAYS TO SUPPORT OLDER ADULTS AND INCREASING THEIR ACCESS TO NUTRITIOUS FOODS. AND ESTABLISH HEALTHY EATING HABITS RIGHT A RIGHT IF I MENTION THOUGH THAT THE STATE PLAN. ANTICIPATES NO INCREASES IN FUNDING IT IT CERTAINLY HAS A HIGH LEVEL GOAL FOR THE APARTMENT OBVIOUSLY IN OUR ADVOCACY ROLE. BUT IN BUT WE ANTICIPATE THE FUNDING THAT WE. THAT WE HAVE AT AT THE AT WITHIN THIS FOUR YEAR TIME PERIOD. ON. WITH THAT I THINK WE FORESHADOWED. WHERE THE COMMITTEE WILL FILL LATER BUT FOR THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE? LIKE TO INVITE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. GOMEZ REYES. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY DIFFER IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEASE A COMENTAR KAREN JONES TO GO FIRST OR IF YOU WANT TO START HOWEVER YOU'D LIKE SOME. I THINK HAVING THEM GO FIRST AS WE HAVE THEM LISTED WITH THE PERFECT THANK YOU. THE TERM. GOOD AFTERNOON JUST A POINT OF CLARIFICATION KAREN JONES IS STUCK IN RAIN AND I'M EXPECTING HER TO WALK IN THE DOOR ANY MINUTE. BUT BECAUSE OMBUDSMAN'S ARE MENGES MAY DO ANYTHING AT ANY POINT I'VE TASK ARE FRESNO MADERA OMBUDSMAN TO COME UP AND TESTIFY. A SELF BUT I'D LIKE TO BEGIN. SO. THAT AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LISA COLEMAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALCUTTA. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THIS COMMITTEE INVESTED IN THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM AND THOSE PROGRAMS DID WHAT YOU ASKED OF THEM. BUT THE GAINS IN PROGRAM ACTIVITIES PETE BY MID TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. LAST FALL FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF OUR PROGRAMS. ENTERED FACILITIES IN RESPONSE TO A COMPLAINT RATHER THAN AND ANNOUNCE FACILITY VISIT. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THEY WERE NO LONGER OPERATING FROM A PLACE OF PREVENTION THEY WERE SIMPLY RESPONDING TO ONE COMPLAINT AFTER ANOTHER? NEVER GETTING A HANDLE ON THE CORE ISSUES AT BEST ADDRESSING THE SYMPTOMS AND MOVING ON TO THE NEXT CRACK FOR HELP. OVER THE YEARS THIS COMMITTEE HAS ASKED US TO LOOK AT FUNDING OUTSIDE OF GENERAL FUNDS. AND. TO HAVE SINCERELY TRIED. BUT AS EVIDENCED BY THE RECENT DISCLOSURE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WE WILL BE LOSING TWELVE PERCENT FUNDING. AUGMENTATION DERIVED FROM A SPECIAL FUND. AND WITH THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE'VE LOST FROM OUR FEDERAL FUNDS. I JUST SETTLE LOSSES TO WHERE TO LOOK AT NOT GENERAL FUNDS. I'VE HEARD IN ITEM I HEARD IN OTHER HEARINGS THAT A DEFENSE FOR NOT FULLY FUNDING THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IS THAT THE STATE ALREADY FUNDS LICENSING AGENCIES. BUT THE EFFORTS OF THE LOCAL PROGRAMS ARE NOT A DUPLICATION OF SERVICES BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHAT THESE FOLKS ARE RESPONDING TO ARE NOT FACILITY REGULATORY VIOLATIONS OR CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS. AT LEAST THEY DON'T START OUT THAT WAY. BUT WITHOUT EARLY INTERVENTION THOSE PROBLEMS WILL AND DO GROW. THEY BECOME COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING FOR THE STATE. FOR THOSE VERY LICENSING AGENCIES. AND AND HOW IS ONE TO BRING IT BACK TO THE RESIDENTS. THE NEEDLESS SUFFERING THAT THE RESIDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR LICENSING TO GET INVOLVED BECAUSE THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IS SO UNDER FUNDED. SO ARE FUNDING REQUEST THIS YEAR. WE REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THE PROGRAMS NEED AND WE IDENTIFIED THE FOUR AREAS. SO THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ITS EYES AND EARS WE'VE JUST GOT TO GET PEOPLE BACK IN OUR FACILITIES. AND WHEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN THE WIND ARE OMBUDSMAN'S ARE IN THE FACILITIES THE LOCAL PROGRAMS HAVE ALREADY STARTED THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING THEIR MORE PROBLEMATIC FACILITY SO THEY CAN SPEND EVEN EXTRA EFFORTS. TO RAISE UP THE STANDARDS IN THOSE PROBLEMATIC FACILITIES. FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SEED MONEY. THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING HAS RECOGNIZED THAT VOLUNTEERISM HAS DROPPED TO A DRAMATIC LEVEL IN OUR LOCAL PROGRAMS. AND AND WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE STATE OMBUDSMAN WILL BE DOING A TRAINING THIS SPRING FOR THE LOCAL PROGRAMS. ON HOW TO DO INNOVATIVE OUGHT RECRUITMENT AND RETAINING OF VOLUNTEERS. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU. ALL THE TRAINEES IN THE WORLD DO NOT PAY FOR ADS IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER THEY DO NOT PAY FOR PRINTING COSTS FOR FLYERS THEY DO NOT PAY FOR THE STAFF TIME TO GET OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITY. SO WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME SEED MONEY TO UTILIZE THIS THIS TRAINING. THE THIRD AREA IS ONE POINT ONE MILLION FOR ADDITIONAL COMPLAIN INVESTIGATIONS WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE IN THE FACILITIES MORE OFTEN YOU'RE UNCOVERING MORE ISSUES. BUT THIS IS A BELL CURVE IT GETS THE POINT WHERE THE FACILITY WITH A COMPLETE START TO DECREASE BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE FACILITY OFTEN ENOUGH THAT YOU ARE CHANGING THE CULTURE. AND YOUR YOUR IMPROVING IT AS AN ONGOING MEASURE. AND THE FINAL PART OF OUR ASK IS A TWO POINT THREE MILLION REPLACING. LOCAL PROGRAMS ARE SIMPLY USING SERVICE DOLLARS TO COVER OPERATING EXPENSES. YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY IT BEFORE. PREVENTION THROUGH OMBUDSMAN ADVOCACY SAVE THE STATE MONEY. THESE LOCAL PROGRAMS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND INEXPENSIVE TOOL THE STATE HAS FOR FULFILLING THE MANDATED PROMISES. WE'RE COMING BACK ASKING YOU FOR THE RESOURCES THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THERE IS NO FLUFF IN THIS ASK. FOR THE LOCAL PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST. SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THIS TIME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ON GOING SUPPORT. THANK YOU LISA. LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM A LOCAL NINJA. I DON'T WANT THAT. THE BOTH. WELL I THINK YOU NEVER. WORKING WITH A BRAND NOT GRANTING THE INNER BUT STILL. THIS JUST SPEAKS TO THAT GET IT DONE. WELL THINK IT AND MY NAME IS SUSAN BUSAN AND I'M THE PROGRAM MANAGER FOR FRESNO MADERA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM I'VE BEEN THERE FOR. WILL BE TWO YEARS IN JUNE. AND SO. WE'VE HAD A GREAT RIDE IT'S BEEN VERY. REWARDING WITH A LOT OF WONDERFUL CHANGING MY BASS FINDING. IS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS. WHICH CONSISTS OF COURSE OF STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL I. A THREE FULL TIME A NUMBERS MAN AT ONE TWENTY HOUR AND TO TEN HOURS TOTALING FOUR FULL TIME EQUIVALENT. TO IN THIRTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS NOT ENOUGH TO RUN THE PROGRAM. IT JUST IS NOT WITH PAY AND STAFF AND RENT AND ALL THE THINGS THAT GO ALONG WITH BUT THAT ASIDE. OUR CONTEXT BUT SUPPLIES EVERY CONTACT ZIP ABOUT OUR CONTRACT IS A BUT AS WE HAVE TO DO VISIT A MONTH TO EACH OF OUR FACILITIES. AB TWO HUNDRED AND. THIRTY TWO FACILITIES RIGHT NOW WITH TWELVE PENDING RIGHT NOW FOR LICENSING. NEARLY EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED BEDS WHICH WE HAVE AB ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES WHAT'S ABOUT A RESIDENT PRESCRIBE. KIND HOW WE'VE BREAKDOWN IN FRESNO MADERA. THE BEST PART ABOUT MY PROGRAM IN MOUNT MY VOLUNTEERS. I LOVE MY VOLUNTEERS IF THEY DO THIS VERY VERY DIFFICULT WORK. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHY THEY WANT TO BUT THEY DO AND I LOVE THEM FOR THAT. I STARTED ON JUNE SIX OF SIXTEEN I HAD SEVENTEEN VOLUNTEERS. TO COVER ALL THE FACILITIES AND I HAVE THIRTY ONE I'VE GOT THREE ON LEAVES I HAVE THIRTY FOUR. IT IS NOT ENOUGH. TO TO DO THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE WANT TO DO TO REALLY INVESTIGATE AND TAKE CARE OF THE CLAIM TO THE COMPLAINTS ON THE PROBLEMS AND THE ISSUES THAT COME UP. WHILE WE CAN REIMBURSE THEM FOR THE MILEAGE AND THAT'S IT AND WILLIAM PENN STATE RATE BUT THEY'RE VERY UNDERSTANDING. A LOT OF MY VOLUNTEERS DONATE THEIR MILEAGE AND THAT'S BEEN GREAT OF THAT'S GOT FROM TWO PEOPLE DOING IT TO ABOUT TWELVE OR FOURTEEN THAT DO EVERY MONTH BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN OUR WORK. OF WHICH SAYS A LOT ABOUT THEIR THEIR COMMITMENT TO THIS PROGRAM. LAUGHS AT THE LAST FISCAL YEAR ARE I'M IT'S BEEN CONTRIBUTED FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO HOURS OF TIME. THAT'S WHAT THEY RIGHT DOWN THE LOT OF RESEARCH TIME AND PAPER WRITING THEIR REPORT WRITING TIME THEY DON'T LIE AGAIN BUT THIS IS IN THE FACILITIES THEY RE THEY THEY. HAD THAT MUCH TIME TALENT AND EFFORT TO HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF OUR RESIDENTS. IN CALIFORNIA YOU MULTIPLY THAT TIMES ARE REALLY ALL HAVE AS LAST YEAR'S RATE THEM CHANGE THE NEW ONE YET THAT'S. HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THREE DOLLARS. BUT THE VALUE. THAT'S A LOT I'M LOT OF DOLLAR VALUE ON TOP OF THE REAL VALUE OF WHAT THE GET THE REAL VALUE IS AND WHAT THEY DO IN THE LIFE TO EQUIPMENT ADVOCATE FOR. A WONDERFUL RESIDENTS AT THAT WE SEE A REGULAR BASIS OUR OMBUDSMAN STAFF NUMBERS AND PROVIDED SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED HOURS OF INTAKE CASE INVESTIGATION AND COMPLAINED VIA FOLLOW UP BUT THE BEST PART OF WHAT THEY DO IS TO BUILD A PROVIDE. TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO OUR FIELD OMBUDSMAN OVERALL IN THEATERS IT'S CRUCIAL TO HAVE SOMEBODY IN THE OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THE THING ABOUT THE ON BUTTON PROGRAMMING YOU PROBABLY KNOW THIS BUT. THERE'S NOBODY ELSE DOING WHAT WE DO. WE THERE'S NO DUPLICATION OF SERVICES NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO DO IT. BUT WE'RE EQUIPPED TO DO IT AND THAT'S UNUSUAL BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I WORK IN THE NONPROFIT WILL FOR QUITE AWHILE IS ALWAYS SOMEBODY WHO SERVES A POPULATION. FROM THIS ANGLE FROM THAT ANGLE FROM HERE THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT FOCUS. WE HAVE ONE FOCUS THAT'S RESIDENT RIDE THREADS EGGMAN OF ITS ADVOCACY TEACH THEM TO FIND THEIR VOICE HELPING THEM. AND NOBODY ELSE DOES IT AND WE DON'T DO IT WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND THAT'S THE SCARY PART BECAUSE AS% YOU SEEN THE NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS DECLINE. AS THE PROGRAM COORDINATOR LOTS OF STUFF TO KEEP ME AWAKE AT NIGHT. SERIOUSLY BECAUSE A WHO'S WHO DO THE WORK AND WHO'S GOING TO GO OUT THERE FOLLOW UP ON THE COMPLACENT ENOUGH TIME. SO BIG A BIG PART OF WHAT LISA SHARE WITH LIZA FAIR REVIEW WAS THAT RE BASING WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO OUR PROGRAM IT WOULD ALLOW ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS TO HIRE. A PROGRAM COORDINATOR PROGRAMS ARE A. WHO DON'T HAVE A PROGRAM GOING IN A VOLUNTEER COORDINATOR VOLUNTEER MANAGER SOMEONE WHO COULD BE IN? IT TAKE THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECRUITING. AND RETAINING AND EQUIPPING AND LOVING ON VOLUNTEERS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT. IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME IF YOU DON'T DO IT WELL IT TAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME AND I DO IT BUT I STILL HAVE TO DO MY REGULAR JOB. AND THAT WOULD MAKE MY LIFE EASIER TO MAKE ALL OF OUR LIVES EASIER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE A GO TO PERSON WHO WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR THEM TO GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEED. THAT MIGHT NEED US FOR THE PROGRAM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE BUT THAT'S THAT WOULD JUST BE THEIR CHEERLEADER AND THEIR TRAINER WHATEVER IT IS THEY THEY NEED FROM THAT PERSON THAT'S WHAT WE COULD BE ABLE TO DO IF WE HAD. AN INCREASE IN OUR BASE FUNDING. IF YOU THINK ABOUT EVERY INDUSTRY CHANGES EVERY YEAR EVEN THE SMALLEST OF NON PROFITS GETS A THREE PERCENT COST OF LIVING RAISE WHAT WE CAN TWENTY SEVEN YEARS WITH THE SAME BASE FUNDING. THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE AND IT'S UNHELPFUL SO WE'RE HOPING FOR A LITTLE HELP HERE AND SO BASICALLY. THE LACK OF THE SPACE FUNDING INCREASE FOR THE LAST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AS. IT COMES UP IN SO MANY WAYS LIKE I AM ARE YOU RIGHT NOW EIGHTEEN PERCENT OVER IN MY MILEAGE. ALLOTMENT IN MY BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR AS OF FEBRUARY AND A FOR A BOY. HOW MANY OF THE PAY MY OMBUDSMAN FOR THEIR LOUSY FIFTY CENTS A MILE OF LIKING GIVE THEM? THOSE OF THE CONCERNS. BECAUSE I WILL HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING IN MY IN MY JUST IN MY BASS LINE. THAT OTHER THING IT'S GONNA HAVE A HUGE IMPACT IN THIS WAS BROUGHT UP AT MY LESS KCB MEETING WE HAVE ONE EVERY MONTH WITH ALL MY VOLUNTEERS AND ONE OF THEM SAID YOU KNOW THE NEW TAX CUTS HAVE OF IT'S TAKING AWAY THE DEDUCTION FOR DONATING MILEAGE. AND SEVERAL OF THEM SAID YOU KNOW I'M I'M PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO START SUBMITTING FOR MILEAGE. AFTER THE KILL ME. IT'S GOING TO KILL ME AND MY BUDGET AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE I NEED MORE VOLUNTEERS IT'S CATCH TWENTY TWO. BECAUSE I NEED THE PEOPLE I'LL PAY MILEAGE. I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BUT I NEED THE PEOPLE IF YOU BRING THEM ONBOARD YOU CREATE MORE MILEAGE AND SO IT'S JUST THIS VICIOUS CIRCLE IT WILL HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON MY BUDGET EXPERIENCE TO BE ON THE CITY I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX I DON'T HAVE A. A PLAN FOR BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. A BIG PART OF OF. THE THE PROBLEM WITH THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE IT WE GO THROUGH PROGRAM COORDINATORS IN THIS INDUSTRY LIKE CRAZY. I REALLY HADN'T SEEN THAT HAPPEN OF THE NEXT CLASS NEXT WEEK WE HAVE TWELVE NEW ONES. I MEAN SINCE LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME WE HAVE TWELVE THE PROGRAM COORDINATORS A THIRD OF THE STATE. WHAT DOES THAT SAY? A HARD JOB. AND THERE IS NO MONEY AND THERE'S NO BUDGET HARDLY TO WORK WAY THEN SO BE IT THERE'S ALWAYS OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK IF YOU'RE NOT. ABLE TO MAKE IT MOST OF US ARE SO PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT WE DO THAT WE STAY. WITH YOU A SHORTER LIFE I THINK BUT THAT. BUT ARE OF THE NEW. IT'S LIKE IN MY PARTICULAR CASE I WAS THE FOURTH PROGRAM CORNER IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. THE TAKE MY JOB. SO AND IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE IF YOU IF WE HAVE A JOB WITH MORE SECURE BASING BASE FUNDING THAT WE CAN KEEP GOOD PEOPLE SO. I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHERE AT. WE WOULD JUST LOVE YOUR SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE. OUR BASELINE OUR BASE FUNNY RE. BEST TERM YOU TAMI AND. I THINK YOU WITH THE AMAZING THING HAPPEN IF WE COULD. GET OR VOLUNTEER. YOU VERY MUCH SOMEONE WILL GO THE STRATUS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I CAN'T TELL THAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB THANK YOU. AGREED. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF OLDER INDEPENDENT ADULTS MY DISTRICT IN THOSE ACROSS OUR STATE. TO RESPECTFULLY SEEK YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BUDGETARY INITIATIVE TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION. IN GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR THE LOCAL LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IS MANDATED TO STATE AND FEDERAL LAW TO PROTECT RESIDENTS RIGHTS AND SURE RESIDENTS ARE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY. THE WORK THAT LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN DO. IS MANY TIMES OVER LOOKED. THEY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE LIVES OF OUR SENIORS IN LONG TERM CARE. OMBUDSMAN OR ABLE TO INTERVENE ON BEHALF OF RESIDENT AND IDENTIFYING BEST A GATE AND RESOLVE COMPLAINTS. COMPLAINTS AT DONE IDENTIFIED BY A BUDS MEN ARE OFTEN THE PRECURSORS TO MORE SEVERE QUE CASES OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT. WHICH TEND TO BE MORE COSTLY. DESPITE THE GROWING FAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE GROWING SERVICE NEED. STATE FUNDING FOR THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. HAVE EXPERIENCED MINIMAL FUNDING RESTORATION. DURING THE MONTH MARK DURING THE MARCH EIGHTH SENATE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. HEARING THE PROGRAMS LEARNED THEY WILL EXPERIENCE AS WAS NOTED EARLIER A TWELVE PERCENT DECREASE IN PROGRAM FUNDING SUPPORT. DUE TO THE LOSS OF A FOURTH YEAR OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME ONLY FUNDING AUGMENTATION. CONSIDERING THAT REDUCTION BENITO FOR PROGRAM FREEBASING IS EVEN MORE CRITICAL AS THE ANNUAL BASE OF THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH PROGRAM. HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AS WAS NOTED EARLIER. THIS NECESSARY ADJUSTMENT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SMALL PROGRAMS THAT STRUGGLE WITH SUSTAINABILITY. LACK OF FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS PUTS OF RESIDENTS AND THE QUALITY OF SERVICE IN JEOPARDY. IN TWO THOUSANDSIXTEEN CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS CONDUCTED ALMOST SEVENTY THOUSAND ANNOUNCED VISITS TO NURSING HOMES AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES. THEY INVESTIGATED AND RESOLVED OVER FORTY THOUSAND COMPLAINTS INCLUDING COMPLAINTS FOR ELDER ABUSE AND NEGLECT. THEY PROVIDED OVER FIFTY TWO THOUSAND CONSULTATIONS TO RESIDENTS. GAVE NEARLY FOURTEEN THOUSAND CONSULTATIONS TO FACILITIES AND WITNESSED OVER TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ADVANCED HEALTHCARE DIRECTIVES. AND PROPERTY TRANSFER DECLARATIONS. WHILE THE NUMBER OF ASSISTED LIVING BAD HAS INCREASED BY OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND THE PAST TEN YEARS. THE NUMBER OF PAID OMBUDSMAN IN CALIFORNIA. HAS BEEN DECREASED BY ALMOST TWENTY PERCENT. THIS PROPOSAL. THAT IS BEING SUBMITTED WOULD RESTORE AND ENHANCE A PROGRAM PROVEN TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY EFFECTIVE IN COMPLAINTS RESOLUTION. COST EFFECTIVE THROUGH ITS USE OF VOLUNTEERS AS WAS NOTED. AND OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE IT'S A DEBILITY TO PREVENT OCCURRENCES OF HARM AND SUFFERING TO RESIDENTS IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. I RISK BY UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE SO MANY GREAT NEEDS. ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT WOULDN'T MENTION JUST BEFORE US ABOUT. FOOD FOR OUR SENIORS. BUT TODAY I ALSO RESPECT WILL BE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE PRIORITIZE THIS FUNDING REQUEST IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STATE BUDGET THANK YOU THANK HER. FROM. NEXT I'D LIKE TO IF I CAN JUST TO ESTABLISH QUORUM FOR BUSINESS SAKE AND THEN I BELIEVE WE HAVE JOB RODRIGUEZ REYES RODRIGUEZ FROM THE STATE LONG TERM. CARE OMBUDSMAN. WHO IS NEXT ON A PANEL? ARAMBULA HERE HARPER HERE MATHIS RUBIO. WOULD. QUORUM IN EUROPE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR GETTING MEMBERS JOE RODRIGUEZ CALIFORNIA STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN. THE AUTHORITY FOR THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM COMES TO US FROM THE FEDERAL OLDER AMERICANS ACT AND IT'S STATE COMPANION THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT. THE OFFICE OF THE STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROVIDES POLICY AND OVERSIGHT TO THE LOCAL LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS. LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM REPRESENTATIVES ARE ADVOCATES WERE ADVOCATES FOR RESIDENTS AND WE PROMOTE AND PROTECT RESIDENTS RIGHTS. THE STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ANALYZES COMMENTS ON AND MONITORS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LAWS REGULATIONS AND EVER OTHER GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES AND ACTIONS. THAT PERTAIN TO THE HEALTH SAFETY WELFARE AND RIGHTS OF RESIDENTS. STATE AND WAS AND ALSO RECOMMENDS ANY CHANGES AND SUCH LAWS REGULATIONS POLICIES AND ACTIONS AS THE OFFICE DETERMINES TO BE APPROPRIATE. APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY STATE CERTIFIED OMBUDSMEN VOLUNTEERS AND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PART TIME AND FULL TIME PAID STAFF AND LOCAL PROGRAMS. IDENTIFY INVESTIGATE RESOLVE COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS ON BEHALF OF APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS. IN ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. INCLUDING DISTINCT PART NURSING FACILITIES INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES AND UP ABOUT APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. LAST YEAR LOCAL OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS INVESTIGATED MORE THAN FORTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED COMPLAINTS. FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS TWO POINT FOUR MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED TO SUPPORT THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. BEGINNING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. LOCAL LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS RECEIVED A MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. THEY ALSO RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL FOREIGNER DEL THOUSAND FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FUND. AS A DIRECT RESULT IN THE INCREASE IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY BED FEE. ON A YEAR TO YEAR A ONE TIME BASIS LOCAL OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS ALSO RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE HEALTH FACILITIES CITATION PENALTIES ACCOUNT. WHAT DID THIS LEAD TO? COMPARING TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE FOLLOWING OCCURRED. WE'VE SEEN A TWENTY ONE PERCENT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INFORMATION CONSULTATION ACTIVITIES PROVIDED TO INDIVIDUALS. AN ELEVEN PERCENT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CONSULTATIONS TO FACILITIES. AN EIGHTEEN PERCENT INCREASE IN NUMBERS AND REPRESENTATIVES PARTICIPATING IN FACILITY SURVEYS ARE INSPECTIONS CONDUCTED BY THE LICENSING AGENCIE. A TWENTY TWO PERCENT INCREASE. IN ON WHAT WOULD WORK EDUCATING AND EMPOWERING FAMILY COUNCILS. A SEVEN PERCENT INCREASE IN OUR IN WORK EDUCATING AND EMPOWERING RESIDENT COUNCILS AND FACILITIES. A SIX PERCENT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF VOLUNTEER IN STAFFING TRAINING HOURS. AND. WITH THIS ONE TIME. PORT THE PROGRAM IS RECEIVED. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HIRE LIMITED TERM PART TIME POSITIONS KNOWING THAT FUNDING COULD AND JUNE THIRTIETH. THAT HAS HELP SUPPORT THE WORK OF MAKING THOSE NON COMPLAINT RELATED FACILITY VISITS AND ALSO INVESTIGATION OF OF COMPLAINTS IN AND FACILITIES. AGAIN WITH THE ONE TIME ONLY MONEY WHICH WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF. WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT TO VOLUNTEERS FOR THEIR MILEAGE AND ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR OUR REPRESENTATIVES. OF SEVERAL OF OUR PROGRAMS ALSO. PURCHASED A EQUIPMENT LIKE COMPUTERS THAT THAT HAD BEEN LONG DELAYED BECAUSE OF OF THE LACK OF FUNDING FOR THE. FOR THESE TYPES OF THINGS. WE WERE ASKED TO TALK ABOUT THE STATE PLAN AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE OF THE LONG TERM CARE BUT SOME PROGRAM IN THE STATE PLAN. WE'VE WE HAVE SEVERAL OBJECTIVES IN OUR STATE PLAN FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. MAKING SEIZING MAKING INFORMATION AND TRAINING ON PERSON CENTERED COUNSELING PRINCIPLES AND PROCESS HE'S AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS. TRANSITION COORDINATORS AND AGENCIES SERVING OLDER ADULTS WITH PERSONS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. AND WE'VE PROVIDED SOME OF THAT TRAINING AT OUR ON THAT'S BEEN FALL CONFERENCE WERE PRIDING AGAIN NEXT WEEK WHEN WE TRAIN OUR NEW COORDINATORS. THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE. TESTIMONY TODAY. WE'RE EXPANDING. AS LISA. HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER. OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN VOLUNTEERISM TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES TO OLDER ADULTS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND FAMILY CAREGIVERS. WE'RE. PRESENTING HOPEFULLY PROMISING INFORMATION ON HOW. PROGRAMS IN THIS DAY AND AGE CAN RECRUIT AND TRAIN AND RETAIN VOLUNTEERS. THAT THE WORK THAT THE LOCAL OMBUDSMAN REPRESENTATIVES ENGAGING IS DIFFICULT WORK IT'S NOT EASY. THIS IS A MOVIE ISN'T A A WARM FUZZY VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE TWENTY PERCENT OF THE CASES THAT WE INVESTIGATE OR ABUSE NEGLECT AND EXPLOITATION. I SEE A LOT OF UGLINESS AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN PEOPLE TO DO THIS IMPORTANT WORK. THE STATE PLAN ALSO RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING OF OMBUDSMAN REPRESENTATIVES AND WORKING COLLABORATIVELY BUT WITH OUR COLLEAGUES OVER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. IN ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES APS FORTUNATELY HAS BEEN THE BENEFICIARY OF SOME GENEROUS FUNDING FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO LOOK AT. TRAINING FOR ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES WORKERS. APS ISM KIND ENOUGH TO SHARE THOSE RESOURCES WITH US AND AS SPACE ALLOWS WILL WILL ENCOURAGE OUR LOCAL OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS. TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT TRAINING WHICH WILL IMPROVE THEIR SKILLS AND HAD IN HANDLING THESE MORE SEVERE IN COMPLICATED CASES OF ABUSE NEGLECT AND EXPLOITATION. WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH APS. AT THE STATE LEVEL ON MANDATED REPORTER TRAINING. THAT THAT THIS TRAINING WILL BE CUSTOMIZED TO THE MANDATED REPORTER BASED ON WHERE THAT PERSON WORKS. SO IF YOU WORK IN A HOSPITAL. DID THE TRAINING WILL BE APPROPRIATE FOR WEARING COMPLAINTS OF ABUSE NEGLECT AND EXPLOITATION GO IF YOU WORK IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IT'LL BE APPROPRIATE FOR THAT POPULATION. SO WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED THAT. APS IS WILLING TO SHARE THOSE RESOURCES WITH US AND WE THINK IT WILL HELP IMPROVE AND STRENGTHEN THE REPORTING SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WERE ALSO COLLABORATING WITH SOCIAL SERVICES AN ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE COMMISSION ON AGING.

FACILITIES CITATION ACCOUNT OPERATED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE ALONG WITH STAKEHOLDERS JUST RAGE SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THAT LANGUAGE AND. WERE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH THEY THEN LATER INCORPORATED AND SOME REVISED LANGUAGE WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING REFUSED REVIEWED BY STAKEHOLDERS. AND TO THE EXTENT THROUGH THAT REVIEW PROCESS OF NO OTHER ISSUES ARE RAISED AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO ADOPT THE LANGUAGE. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE.

AND THIS IS A VERY EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE PROGRAM THAT PROTECTS VULNERABLE PEOPLE DEVELOPS PERSON CENTER CARE. I'M RACHEL TATE WITH THE WAY I REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE WISE AND HEALTHY AGING LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. PROUDLY SERVING OVER SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS IN OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES IN LOS ANGELES. LAST YEAR WE INVESTIGATED OVER TWELVE THOUSAND CASES WITH ONLY TWENTY STAFF AND SIXTY FIVE VOLUNTEERS. WE ARE COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM THAT WORKS TO INTERVENE BEFORE MINOR ISSUES BECOME CATASTROPHIC. OUR TOP THREE COMPLETE CATEGORIES ARE RESIDENTS RESIDENT PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE. INAPPROPRIATE DISCHARGES AND EVICTIONS AND GROSS NEGLECT. DEMAND FROM ELDERS INDEPENDENT ADULT CONSUMERS IS INCREASING AND THE CASES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMPLEX. WITH THE POTENTIAL ONE MILLION DOLLAR LOSS THE FUNDING WE WILL BE SEEING IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR DUE TO THE PROJECTED LACK OF FUNDS IN THE CITATION PENALTY ACCOUNT. THIS BUDGET REQUEST IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO PROTECTING LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS. ROL COMMISSION ON AGING I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS ALSO ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF SOCIAL ISOLATION THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. IF YOU HAVE NEVER VISITED A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT MOST FAMILIES DON'T GO. AND IF THEY DO IT'S VERY RARE. I GREW UP FOLLOWING MY MOTHER TO VISIT AN ELDERLY FRIEND AND OTHERS IN THE NURSING HOME. THESE THIS WOMAN AND HER. DAUGHTER AND SON IN LAW HAD MOVED FAR AWAY THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE WE BECAME HER FAMILY. AND THAT CONTINUES TO THIS DAY SO THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE THESE VOLUNTEERS GOING IN AND. DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS AND BEING THAT FRIEND AND THAT VOICE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. HELLO MY NAME'S NICOLE HOW I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR OMBUDSMAN SERVICES OF CONTRA COSTA AND SOLANO I REPRESENT A TEAM OF OF WHAT LONG WITH A TEAM OF NINE STAFF MEMBERS.

THE CASES WE DEAL WITH RANGE FROM HOSPITAL DISCHARGES TO HOMELESS SHELTERS ARE KEEPING RESIDENTS WHO SUDDENLY WITH RATE INCREASES. HORRIBLE INCIDENTS OF ABUSE NEGLECT WHICH REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY GAZE WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS IS MUCH MORE THAN COLD COFFEE AND FINDING LOS PURSES. THE WORK HAS BECOME MORE SIGNIFICANT AND THE TRAINING FOR VOLUNTEERS REQUIRE SPENT TIME OVERSIGHT AND CARE MANAGEMENT FOR THEM BECAUSE THE THINGS WE HEAR ABOUT. I CANNOT HEREBY GRANDMOTHER BEING ABUSED AND NEGLECTED AND NOT TAKE THAT HOME AT NIGHT. THE FUNDING I RECEIVE AYE AYE MY BUDGET EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT COMES WITH THE SOURCES THROUGH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT AGING. I'M ABLE TO FUNDRAISE FOR THE REST OF IT BUT WITHOUT THAT MONEY I WILL DO STAFF MEMBERS. LAST NIGHT MY ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT GAVE HER NOTICE BECAUSE I CANNOT PAY HER AS MUCH OF THE COMPANY IN MY AREA COUNT THIS MONEY IS CRITICAL FOR THE SUPPORT MY AGENCY. THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS TYRION BECKNER I'M AN MSW INTERN WORK AND ON THE CALL HEALTHY ON THE TWO THIRDS OF THE CONTRA COSTA AND SOLANO. AND. I'VE SEEN A LOT NOW AND WORKING IN THE LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM AND TO THINK THAT HAVE BEEN REALLY SHOCKING THAT IT STOOD OUT TO ME THE FIRST OF THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS DON'T RECEIVE ANY VISIT FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAT MEANS THAT THE OMBUDSMAN. ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE WORKING TO EMPOWER AN ADVOCATE FOR THEM THE SECOND IS IN WORKING AND RESIDENTS THE FEAR THAT THEY HAVE A RETALIATION COMING FORWARD. THERE'S A HUGE NEED FOR THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE I HOPE WE SUPPORT. AND KIM. I KRISTA TELLING ME THIS SENIOR ADVOCACY SERVICES FROM CINEMA COUNTY ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF CALCUTTA CLOSER. I'M I WOULD LIKE TO JUST PUT UP LAST YEAR WE INVEST A INVESTIGATED OVER NINE HUNDRED CASES IN JUST CINEMA COUNTY I'VE TO HONOR FACILITIES THAT. YOU DO THE MATH ON THAT I'M TOUCHING OVER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WHICH MEANS RESOLVING SOME SICK PICK AN ISSUE WITH THEM. I ALSO DISLIKE TO PUT THIS IN YOUR THINKING ABOUT THE VOLUNTEERS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ON TEARS IF YOU SET A ROOM WITH A HUNDRED PEOPLE AND SAID PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO INTO A NURSING HOME TO INVESTIGATE ELDER ABUSE. THINK ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD RAISE THEIR HAND. MINUTE REALISTICALLY THE. TRYING TO FIND VOLUNTEERS AND THEN. MAINTAIN THEM AND KEEP PORTING SERVICES IS A HUGE ENDEAVOR CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. BUT IT IS A SPECIAL PERSON WHO DOES THIS SO. I THINK YOUR FOR YOUR PAST SUPPORT IN YOUR FUTURES. EGGMAN.

MY NAME IS MELISSA FLAHERTY YOUNG REPRESENTING THE COURT ACCORDING TO FOR THE STANISLAUS COUNTY. I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THE SILICON VALLEY BUT LIVED IN DOES THE ALBERT CULTURE VALLEY FOR THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS I LEARNED TO APPRECIATE. THE FOLKS THERE THAT FORMER TO TABLE COUNT OCONEE IS HAS IS SO WONDERFUL THE FOLKS THERE ARE HARD WORKING PEOPLE. EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THOSE FOLKS MIGHT END UP IN REHAB OR LONG TERM ASSISTED LIVING OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY SOME OF THOSE DON'T HAVE REPRESENTATION. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THIS A WOMAN THAT WAS. HAD A FORM WITH THEIR PARENTS SHE DEDICATED HER WHOLE LIFE. TO HER FARM WITH HER PARENTS AND HAD NO ONE THERE TO REPRESENT HER AND FORTUNATE THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM WAS THERE FOR HER. THE US THE THIS UP PROGRAM ON THE TO PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTED LOOK MANY MANY YEARS AGO AND WITH THE COST AT THAT TIME. NOW THE COST IS CHANGE THE EMBITTERED PROGRAM AND THIS INCREASE IS REASONABLE TO THE. IT COST EFFECTIVE THIS TO THE STATE. THANK YOU EGGMAN. GOOD AFTERNOON SUSAN THE MORRIS ON BEHALF OF THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION WELL OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE RESIDENTS AND OUR STATES ARE CMP'S. AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HAVE A COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. AND MANY OF THEM ARE ON REPRESENTED IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM IN OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WE SUPPORT THAT SPENDING REQUEST THINKING. WHY CAN'T EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THEY TRIPLE A OF SANTA CRUZ AND SAN BENITO COUNTIES ALSO SPEAKING IN SUPPORT AND I THINK THIS ON BUT THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS KIND OF OUR INTERNAL FLAW IN ALL THESE AGING PROGRAMS? THE DAY RELY TREMENDOUSLY ON VOLUNTEERS TO PROVIDE WHAT'S PROFESSIONAL LEVEL SERVICE AND I DON'T THINK ANY PROGRAM EXEMPLIFIES THAT BETTER THAN OMBUDSMAN. AND IT'S TRAGIC THAT EVEN ON TOP OF THAT ARE WITHIN THAT DESIGN WE HAVE TO STRUGGLE FOR EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS I'M JUST ONE PERSONAL COMMENTS. ON SPEAKING TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO'S COMMENT ABOUT LONELINESS AND ISOLATION. OMBUDSMAN PAYS PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN THIS AND ONE OF MY FONDEST MEMORIES OF VISITING MY MOM IN NURSING HOMES. WOULD BE WHEN SHE WOULD SAY ALTHOUGH THERE WAS JUST SOMEBODY HERE FROM AN OFFICE THAT KNOWS YOU AND SHE WOULD MEAN THE OMBUDSMAN PERSON THAT IT STOP BY TO SAY HI. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S JUST AN ADDED VALUE TO THE PROGRAM OFFERS I'M INJURED THEN JUST LASTLY I'M WHAT PRICE TO BE PUT ON ELDER ABUSE I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE ANY. THINK IS SEX. CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE ECHOES THE. THOUGHTS OF EACH OF THE PRESENTERS THAT I'VE SPOKEN HERE HANDLE WE FULLY SUPPORT. FUNDING OF THE A LONG TERM CARE PROGRAM. SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENT ON PUBLIC OUR OWN ISSUE THREE I'LL BRING IT BACK THE DYESS FRONT. SEEING NONE I HAVE A FEW. HOPE PLEASE. PUT OUT FOR I JUST WANT SAY THANK YOU TO ALL THOSE OF YOU WHO TRAVELED FAR AND WIDE TO PASS TO DELIVER THIS MESSAGE AND. AND TRUST WE WE HEAR YOU ABSOLUTELY AND I'M. NOT REPRESENTING. AN AREA THAT IS A VERY RURAL DISTRICT. WITH WITH JUST LIMITED SERVICES AND CHALLENGES IN GENERAL. THESE THESE ISSUES ARE REALLY REALLY CUTE AND THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IS A REALLY VALUABLE COMPONENT. OF FOR US IN OUR IN IN MY DISTRICT AND SO SO WHY WHY WHY WILL BE. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. IN SUPPORT OF THIS FUNDING REQUEST BECAUSE I THERE IS THAT THERE IS A HUGE VALUE TO TO THE FOLKS. WHO WHO UTILIZE YOUR THIS SERVICE OR THAT YOU THAT YOU HELPED TO THEIR SERVICES? AND I GO BACK TO I THINK WE ARE JUDGED BY HOW WE CARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND AND I FOR ONE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS LIKE THIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD. FOR LEASE A COMMON I HAVE A QUESTION WHAT WOULD THE EFFECTS ON PRESENCE IN FREQUENCY FOR PROBLEM FACILITIES BE UNDER YOUR PROPOSAL. I'M SORRY SAY THE QUESTION AGAIN WHAT WOULD THE AFFECTS ON PRESENTS AND FREQUENCY FOR PROBLEM FACILITIES BE UNDER YOUR PROPOSAL. WELL THAT'S GOOD OKAY. SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT. I SAN LUIS OBISPO PROGRAM ARE SAN LUIS OBISPO PROGRAM IS PROBABLY OUR BEST FUNDED PROGRAM IF NOT IN THE STATE IN THE NATION. AA SENIOR DIED AND LEFT THE PROGRAM OVER A MILLION DOLLARS AND SO THAT PROGRAM GETS LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STATE AND FEDERAL MONEY AND THEN THEY DREW DOWN OFF OF THAT MILLION DOLLARS. SO THEY WERE ABLE TO GO FROM ONE POINT FIVE EMPLOYEES TO THREE EMPLOYEES THEY WENT FROM NINE VOLUNTEERS TO TWENTY SEVEN VOLUNTEERS THEY WENT FROM ELEVEN HUNDRED FACILITY VISITS TO TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED FACILITY VISITS. AND YES THE COMPLAINT NUMBERS WENT FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED. BUT THE KEY FACTOR. THAT I REALLY WANT TO DRILL DOWN. THEY WENT FROM TWENTY SIX COMPLAINTS OF ELDER ABUSE ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE SEVERE ENOUGH THAT REQUIRED LICENSING INTERVENTION. THEY WENT FROM TWENTY SIX DOWN TO FOUR. SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T FACTOR IN THE HUMAN THAT TWENTY TWO PEOPLE DID NOT EXPERIENCE BAT. TRUMP TRAUMA. HOW MUCH DID IT SAY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT TO HAVE STATE EMPLOYEES TRAVELING BECAUSE THERE ARE NO LOCAL LICENSING OFFICES IN SAN LUIS OBISPO? EVERYONE OF THOSE REQUIRE IT LEAST A FOUR HOUR DRIVE FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT POTENTIALLY HOTEL STAY. SO. HOW IS IT GOING TO CHANGE? THE THE CLIMATE IN THE FACILITIES. THERE IS GOING TO THERE'S GOING TO BE A CULTURAL CHANGE. TOWARDS EMBRACING A. RESIDENT CENTERED CARE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE OMBUDSMAN STILL WE DON'T SITE FACILITIES WE DON'T COME IN WITH A CITATION BOOK WE'RE NOT BEAR TO TO. ARREST ANYONE WERE WALKING GOOGLE ON WHAT THE RULES ARE AND SO YOU EMPOWER THE RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS TO KNOW WHAT THOSE RULES ARE. AND ULTIMATELY THAT FACILITY KINDA GOES ALONG WITH IT BECAUSE IT GETS TIRING TO HAVE A PERSON LIKE ME COME BACK EVERY SINGLE WEEK GOING YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE REALLY CAN'T GIVE AMAT THUGS GOOD NO I'M JUST NOT GONNA LET YOU DO IT EVERY NIGHT I'M GONNA COME BACK AND. SAY THAT'S NOT OKAY. SO. IT'S THE THE PRESENCE OF THAT NAGGING WATER DRIPPING THAT MAKES YOU CHANGE. NOT THAT MY OMBUDSMAN'S ARE NAGGING ON. THEY'RE LOVELY PEOPLE. PREFERRED MENGES NINJAS THEY ARE NINJAS. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS CAN YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON ONE TIME FUNDING IN YOUR VIEW OF THIS PROPOSAL WHY WOULD IT WORK OR NOT. TO SAY THAT I'M NOT GRATEFUL FOR ONE TIME FUNDING WOULD BE OF AN UNDERSTATEMENT ONE TIME FUNDING HAS ALLOWED US TO TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN AND HAS. GIVEN US THE OPPORTUNITY AND TO TO INVEST IN A MORE COMPUTERS AND TO TO HAVE. BETTER. PHONE SYSTEMS ARE LARGER PROGRAMS CAN USE THAT MONEY TO HIRE STAFF BECAUSE THEY CAN. BACK FILL UNTIL THAT ONE TIME MONEY ACTUALLY HITS THE PROGRAM BUDGET. BUT OUR SMALLER PROGRAMS JUST CAN'T. THE MONEY MAY BE IN THE JULY BUDGET BUT IT'S NOT IN THEIR CONTRACT THAT STARTED IN JULY. SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING STARTS THEIR CONTRACT PERIOD WHICH IS THE END OF SEPTEMBER. AND THEN THEY HAVE NINETY DAYS IN WHICH THEY'RE ENTERING A CONTRACT WITH THE TRIP LAYS AND THEN THE TRIPLE A.'S GET NINETY DAYS TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. SO WHILE WE ARE APPRECIATIVE THAT WE GOT A MILLION DOLLARS ON JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WE HAVE LOCAL PROGRAMS IS STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY OF THEIR SHARE. YET. BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO GET THE. THAT'S ONE OF THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF ONE FAMILY MONEY YOU'RE HIRING SOMEONE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING WORKING TO KEEP YOU FOR MAYBE. NINE MONTHS AND THEN WE GONNA LET YOU GO. THE OTHER PART OF. PROBLEM OF ONE TIME MANY IS WE DON'T HAVE ONE TIME ONLY PROBLEMS. WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT ARE ONGOING. AND. IT. YES IF YOU GAVE ME TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR VOLUNTEER I RECRUITED PROGRAM THAT BE GREAT. BUT IT WOULD TAKE US TIME TO CREATE THE COLLATERAL TO CREATE THE THE THE. THE ABILITY TO TO ACTUALLY GET THOSE VOLUNTEERS IN THE DOOR. SO WE MIGHT RUN OUT OF TIME BEFORE WE WE RAN OUT OF THOSE DOLLARS IT IF THEY WERE JUST IN THAT AREA. BUT I THINK. ALSO SOMETIMES ONE TIME MONEY HARMS US. A FEW YEARS BACK THE VENTURA PROGRAM RECEIVED A GRANT THAT THEY BELIEVE WOULD BE ONGOING IN NATURE. AND THE GRANT WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS RESIDENTS THAT WERE NON ENGLISH SPEAKING. AND SO THAT PROGRAM CREATED COLLATERAL POSTERS FLYERS TO PROMOTE ON THIS AND ACTIVITIES FOR OUR SPANISH A SPEAKING RESIDENTS. THE THE LOCAL PROGRAM HIRED AND TRAINED SPANISH SPEAKING OMBUDSMAN AND THEN JUST AS THE PHONE CALLS ARE STARTIN TO COME THEN. THE FUNDING WAS NOT RENEWED FOR THE NEXT YEAR. BUT ALL THOSE POSTERS WERE STILL UP IN THE IN THOSE FACILITIES. AND WE HAD TO LET THOSE VIOLENT WE HAD TO LET THE STAFF GO THAT WERE SPANISH SPEAKING. BUT FOR MANY MONTHS TO COME. RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WERE VERY FRUSTRATED TO CALL THE LOCAL OFFICE AND FIND OUT THAT THIS REALLY GREAT INNOVATIVE PROGRAM THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE WAS NO LONGER THERE. I THINK IN SOME WAYS. IT DOES HARM. WHEN WE CAN'T. FOLLOW THROUGH. FOR THE DEPARTMENT FEEL LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BUT HOW DOES THIS PROPOSAL ONLINE OR NOT WITH THE STATE PLAN. JODY ONE SPEAK TO THAT SURE. AS A DIRECTOR CONNELLY INDICATED EARLIER. THE OBJECTIVES IN THE STATE PLAN REALLY ADDRESS WHAT WE CAN DO WITH EXISTING RESOURCES IT DOESN'T COUNTENANCE. AND A SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR BANK TATIAN. AS LIZA INDICATED WE ARE APPRECIATIVE THE ONE TIME ONLY MONEY THAT WE'VE RECEIVED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. AND CERTAINLY WE COULD USE THE MONEY. BUT. AND LISA SAID. IT WOULD BE FOR ONE YEAR. AND THE PROBLEMS WOULD REMAIN. FOR FINANCE CAN YOU PLEASE CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTATIVES LEGISLATIVE STAFF THE LA L. ABOUT THE NECESSARY. NECESSITY FOR AND FUNCTIONING OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE CHANGES. AND THEN. FINALLY THE SUBCOMMITTEE IS INTERESTED IN FACILITATING. AS MUCH OF THE TRANSFER IN THE ACCOUNTS AS AS REASONABLE AS A WAY TWO PARTIALLY RESPONDS TO THE NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO CONSIDERING THE PROPOSED AUGMENTATION. SO WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE THREE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER AND GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR SHOW. ARE YOU ONE OF THE. OKAY. ISSUE FOUR WE'RE GOING TO START WITH DUSTIN HARPER. AND THEN LIKE DENISE LIKE OR. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY GARDEN THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASE FOR HIM SAYS BE PROGRAM. MY NAME'S DUSTIN HARPER AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AND SISKIYOU SIDE ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS THE INSTITUTE ON AGING. PROVIDER ABOUT SERVICES IN SAN FRANCISCO. I'M HERE BECAUSE MY SITE UNLIKE MOST OTHER MISSISSIPPI SITES THAT RISK OF CLOSING ITS DOORS THIS NEXT YEAR. IN THE FACE OF RAPIDLY GROWING COST OF DOING BUSINESS. THIS PROGRAM HASN'T HAD A RATE INCREASE IN TWELVE YEARS. AND BY FAR NUMBER ONE COST DRIVERS THE SALARIES. AND BENEFITS OF OUR NURSES AND SOCIAL WORKERS. IS NURSES AND SOCIAL WORKERS SPEND THEIR DAYS. SERVING LOW INCOME OLDER ADULTS IN THEIR HOMES. AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THEY'RE THE PRIMARY BARRIER BETWEEN THESE INDIVIDUALS AND LONG TERM CARE NURSING HOME PLACEMENT. THESE ARE CHALLENGING JOBS IN NURSES CORRECTLY EXPECT LEVELS OF QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE FROM THESE NURSES AND SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE WORK THEY DO. THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE OF NURSING AND SOCIAL WORK COMPENSATION IS INCREASED BY MORNING THIRTY PERCENT THE PAST TWELVE YEARS. EVEN THE MOST WELL INTENTIONED ORGANIZATION CAN'T CONTINUE TO OPERATE PROGRAM OR COSTS RISE BY. MORETHAN THIRTY PERCENT ALONG ZERO PERCENT INCREASE ON THE REVENUE SIDE. OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM NOW TALK TO GREAT LENGTHS REGARDING. THE GROWING NEED FOR SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND MISSISSIPPI IS ONE OF THOSE SOLUTIONS. AND THIS IS BE CARE MANAGERS CONNECT BENEFICIARIES TO NEEDED SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. THEY ASSIST INDIVIDUALS AND NAVIGATING THE MEDICAL AND SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEMS OF CARE. AND WHEN THERE IS NOT AN AVAILABLE RESOURCE TO MEET THE NEEDS AND ASSIST BE CARE MANAGERS PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES FOR THEIR CLIENTS. NOT THAT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'RE HEARING REGARDING. THE ROLE OF THE OMBUDSMAN PLAY. AND ASSIST BE CARE MANAGERS ALSO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THEIR CLIENTS WHEN THEY'RE IN THE HOME. THIS IS WHAT ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH LOOKS LIKE. IT'S SOMETHING THAT ARE NONPROFIT PROVIDERS BELIEVE IN. AND ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO DO WELL. WE'RE ASKING FOR IS TO HAVE OUR REVENUE KEEP UP WITH THE RISING COST OF DOING BUSINESS. I MISSISSIPPI'S ALSO VALUABLE ALTERNATIVE LONG TERM CARE UTILIZATION. VENICE SP IS SUCCESSFUL IN DELAYING LONG TERM CARE PLACEMENT FOR JUST FIVE PERCENT OF ITS POPULATION. IT'S MONTH THE PAYS FOR ITSELF. WE APPRECIATE CONSIDERING THE FUNDING REQUEST AND PLEASE LET US OUT THERE'S ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WE CAN. THANK YOU SIR. HI GOOD AFTERNOON DENISE LIKER INDEPENDENCE AT HOME ON LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I REPRESENT ONE OF THE LAW ONE OF THE. OLDEST MS US P. SITES IN THE STATE A WE ARE ONE OF THE FIRST DEMO SITES IT'S FORTY YEARS AGO THAT WE STARTED AND WE ARE STILL DOING IT TODAY. I'M I'M HERE BUT TODAY ECHOING I'M. WELL MISTER HARPER IS. IT IS IS TALKING ABOUT ABOUT OUR FUNDING REQUEST. PUT IT IN CONTEXT OF THE TYPICAL PROFILE OF AN MS AS P. CLIENT IS A FEMALE IN HER EIGHTIES. LIVES ALONE. PROBABLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN OR IF SHE DOES THEY'RE NOT LIVING IN THE AREA. SHE ONLY HAS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. TO LIVE ON. SHE'S GOT FOUR TO FIVE CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND SHE'S GOT FOUR TO FIVE MAYBE SIX. IMPAIRMENTS OF ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING SHE'S TRYING TO EAT SHE'S TRYING TO KEEP HEAT ON CHEESE TRYING TO PAY RENT IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH AFFORDED WHICH IS A PROBLEM IN OF ITSELF. AND THEN THROW IN THAT SHE PROBABLY SPEAKS A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. SO THIS IS THE POPULATION THAT MS US PIAS THEREFORE IT'S A VERY SMALL SEGMENT OF THE OLDER DOT POPULATION. BUT IT'S A NURSING HOME CERTIFIED POPULATION THE CA TOMORROW BE PUT INTO ONE OF THOSE BEDS IF THERE WAS ONE AVAILABLE EVEN. AND BEFORE AND IT'S VERY HIDDEN POPULATION. SO FOR FORTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE DOING THIS AND CONNECTING THEM. SO ARE FUNDING INCREASE IF YOU PUT IT IN CONTEXT OF NURSING HOME DOLLARS. THE FUNDING REQUEST THAT WERE ASKING FOR FIFTY THREE FIFTY SIX PER CLIENT PERSPECTIVE IT'S LOT PER YEAR IF YOU PUT IT ON MEDI CAL BEDS IN A NURSING HOME. THERE'S AMEND SAVINGS THERE ALREADY FROM WHAT IT COSTS TO BE IN A NURSING HOME BED WHICH I BELIEVE IS OWE THE MEDI CAL RATE IS ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND PER YEAR FOR A BED. SO THERE'S THERE'S A THERE'S A TREMENDOUS SAVINGS OUR STAFF OUR HANDS AND FEET ON THE GROUND. AND BECAUSE THEY'RE ON THE GROUND IN THEIR IN THE HOME THEY SEE EVERYTHING THE ADDRESS EVERYTHING. FREE RESOURCES AS WELL AS CONNECTING. SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING. SHORE UP THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE WHERE THE PROGRAM OF LAST RESORT THE PEOPLE COME TO US UNDER THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO GO THEY'VE BEEN TURNED AWAY THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THEM. ARE QUITE FRANKLY THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS WHERE TO GO FOR SERVICES. SO THAT'S OUR FIRST REQUEST IT TODAY IS IS IS WE NEED HELP SHORING UP THIS PROGRAM SO THAT PROVIDERS LIKE MYSELF AND THE OTHERS ACROSS THE STATE CAN CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE SERVICES. FOR POPULATION HAS NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. THE OTHER ITEM UP YOUR TO ADDRESS TODAY AS I KNOW IN THE AGENDA. THERE IS A LANGUAGE BUT ACCORDING TO CARE INITIATIVE OF WHICH MS US P. IS ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN. AND. I'M SURE THE ADMINISTRATION THEM AND STILL NEEDS TO REPORT OUT ON PROGRESS SO I'M HOPING I'M NOT STEALING ANYBODY'S THUNDER BUT I'M LAST YEAR WE WERE HERE FOR. SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO BE WORKING ON. ON THIS FOR THIS BONNEVILLE POPULATION BEING ABLE A PLAN ACCORDINGLY BECAUSE MANAGED CARE QUITE FRANKLY HAS NOT TAKEN CARE OF THIS POPULATION. AND SO THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE AND CONVERSATIONS HAVE RESUMED AND THERE ARE NEW PLAYERS AT THE TABLE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT TRANSITION WILL LOOK LIKE IN WHAT THE FUTURE MAY HOLD. BUT WE DO HAVE A FEW CAUTIONS AND SO WE HAVE EAGER LEAVE BEEN INVOLVED. IN TRYING TO MOVE IN TRYING TO SEE THE RIGHT PATH FORWARD AND HONORING THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT FROM WAY BACK TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE WAS PASSED. IN ORDER TO HAVE THEM ASSESS P. WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH MANAGED CARE. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THE FOUNDATION OF LEARNING TOGETHER WHAT IT TAKES TO TAKE CARE OF THIS POPULATION SINCE WE HAD THE EXPERIENCE. AND LATER IN THAT FOUNDATION OF INFORMATION DATA AND LEARNING. TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THE FUTURE OF MS US P. FMS WERE TO GO INTO MANAGED CARE. THREE YEARS HAVE GONE BY AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT IN THE PLACE THE FOUNDATION IS NOT THEY ARE. AT THIS POINT WE HAVE TWENTY MONTHS LEFT AND ALTHOUGH CONVERSATIONS HAVE RESUMED WHICH OUR WONDERFUL. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS TRANSITION PLANNING WITHOUT A FOUNDATION TWENTY TO CHARACTERIZE IT LIKE BUILDING A HOUSE? YOU BUILD A HOUSE ON A VERY STRONG FOUNDATION. IF YOU DON'T BUILD IT ON A VERY STRONG FOUNDATION BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN. AND SO WHEN YOU THINK OF THIS FRAIL VERY VULNERABLE POOR POPULATION WE'VE GOTTA GET IT RIGHT FOR THEM SO WE ARE OUT ON BEHALF OF THEM A SAY IN THE CCI SITES WE ARE HERE WE WILL. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEGUN BUT WE ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET BACK THE THREE YEARS THAT ARE GONE. AND SO WE MAY BE BACK TO NEED SOME HELP AND ASSISTANCE. IN TERMS OF WHAT IS THE RIGHT PATH SO WE DON'T GET IT WRONG FOR THE FRAIL PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. DOCTOR CALMLY. YES THANK YOU. I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM THE PANELISTS A IN TERMS OF WHAT THE EMPHASIS P. PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR MANY OF WHICH IS THAT AS A CABBIE OUT FOR MANY OF THE PARTICIPANTS ON WELL OVER EIGHTY. EIGHTY PERCENT THEY ARE ENROLLED IN THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM BUT REALLY NEED THAT EXTRA LEVEL IN TERMS OF CARE COORDINATION. OTHER PURCHASE SERVICES THAT SUPPORT THEM THAT THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM WOULD NOT PROVIDE. SO REALLY THIS IS IF YOU LOOK AT THAT GRADATION IN TERMS OF. BEING ABLE TO STAY IN THE HOME YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THAT CONTINUUM IN TERMS OF THE SERVICES. UNDER CURRENT LEE I JUST PUT ON WHAT ASCETIC CONTEXT BECAUSE FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS IT SEEMS EVERY TIME WE'VE COME TO TESTIFY ABOUT MS SP. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT IN RELATION TO SEE SEE IAM THE ROLLOUT AND A SEVEN COUNTIES THEY'RE CURRENTLY THIRTY EIGHT EMESIS P. SITES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'M SERVING APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THOUSAND POUND CLIENTS PER YEAR THAT EQUATES TO NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SOME ODD SLOTS. I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE NOT THE SLOTS BUT IT'S THE WAY IT WORKS. AS I AS DENISE MENTIONED AND. AND I DID AS WELL IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE REALLY ENVISIONED. THAT THE CARE OF THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT WOULD BE WORKING WITH THE I. MISSISSIPPI SITES AND AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. THAT CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICE OF WOULD BE TRANSFERRING TO THE HEALTH PLANS. THAT DOES THERE ARE TWELVE AND MISSISSIPPI SITES IN THOSE SEVEN. COUNTIES SIGH I JUST WANTED SET THAT IN IN TERMS OF A CAVIAR. THE TRANSITION DALY ARM FOR. THE HEALTH PLANS TO ASSUME. THAT RESPONSIBILITY IS BASED ON HOW PLAN READINESS TO DO SO. AND. HAS BEEN UPDATED OVERTIME ARM AND A SET FOR NO SOONER THAN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. BUT EVEN SHOULD THAT OCCUR AT THAT POINT IN TIME. THERE WILL STILL BE TWENTY SIX NEMESIS P. SITES. WITH FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED. SOME ODD SLOTS OUTSIDE THOSE CCI COUNTIES. THAT WILL BE CONTINUING TO OPERATE AND PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT OF AGING ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE. PROCESS FOR RENEWING THEM NEMESIS P. WAY FOR YOU KNOW ARE ON AN ONGOING BASIS IN TERMS OF THAT. SO I JUST WANTED TO PROM BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE FOCUSED SO MUCH ON. RIGHTLY SO IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT IT EMPHASIS BE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CCI WE'VE KIND OF HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THE REST OF THE PROGRAM OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS JUST WANTED TO WRITE THAT. THAT CAVIAR. THANK YOU. I'M WEEK NEXT HAVE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FUJIMOTO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR WE MAY MOVE ON NO NO CUT NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME THEN IF WE CAN MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE FOR SARAH BROOKS FROM PHD S.. BUT I PUT IT UP. GOOD AFTERNOON SIR BROOKS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I'M I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS I THINK DIRECTOR CONLEY AND LAID IT OUT BAD WELL I DO WANT TO COMMENT ON THE FACT THAT. THAT THE THE. TRANSITION OF. EMESIS PIZZA MANAGED CARE HAS BEEN PUSHED BACK SEVERAL TIMES AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THAT'S WHY OUR WORK PLAN ITSELF HAS ALSO BEEN DELAYED WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND WHAT THE EMPHASIS BESIDES AN ASSOCIATION TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SOLID PLAN IN PLACE AYE WHEN WE DO TRANSITION IN AND NO SOONER THAN JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE COMMENTS. BELIAU. SEEING KNOW HOW WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOR. GOOD AFTERNOON. JANET HEATH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE AND ASSIST DECIDE ASSOCIATION. JUST ONE OTHER POINT OUT THAT AS YOU HEARD THERE THIRTY EIGHT SITES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE WITH THE MISSISSIPPI. THAT ACTUALLY SERVES FORTY SEVEN COUNTIES BOTH RURAL AND URBAN. SO WE COVER MOST OF THE STATE OF THIS POINT. AS YOU HEARD WE HAVE HAD AN INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX. THE SAME TIME THE STATE OF CALIFORNIANS HAD AN INFLATION RATE OF TWENTY THREE PERCENT. SOURCE FACING A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES WITH OUR FINANCING. REGULATORY LIMITATIONS. IN WHICH IN MISSISSIPPI PROVIDERS CANNOT MAKE UP FOR PROGRAM DEFICITS INCLUDE. INCREASING OR DECREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY SERVE. REDUCING PROGRAM SERVICES SERVING PRIVATE PAY CONSUMERS OR HIRING LESS QUALIFIED STAFF THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE CANNOT DO. BECAUSE THE REGULATIONS. IN OUR ATTEMPT TO TRY TO MAKE DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE WE'VE REDUCE STAFF. WE'VE REDUCED THE HOURS TO THE STAFF THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RETAIN. WE'VE PROVIDED NO OR MINIMAL SALARY INCREASES. AND SOME OF THE SITE DIRECTORS ARE CURRENTLY NOT RECEIVING ANY SALARY FROM THE IN MISSISSIPPI PROGRAM. IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE GETTING THEIR MONEY FROM OTHER SOURCES. HOST ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUPPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM BY. BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. IN THE CLOSURE IN TURN OVER OF ELEVEN SITES SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS FACT THAT HOST AGENCIES ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO CONTINUE TO SUPPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. SO WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THE FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR HOUSE THINK YOU. KIM. HELLO I'M JOHN DILUTES EXECUTIVE HEALTH PROJECTS AND WE RUN THE. BOTTOM I MISSISSIPPI'S FOR SANTA CRUZ AND MONTEREY COUNTIES AND AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR I CAN TELL YOU THAT NONE OF OUR STAFF WILL GET RAISES THIS YEAR LAST WEEK AT ONE PERCENT. AND WILL BE CUTTING BENEFITS ON TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAM SO I FINALLY OUT THERE THAT OUT THERE IN THAT TWELVE YEARS OF. YOU KNOW FUNDING CUTS HAVE IMPACTS ON YOU KNOW BOTH GOOD PEOPLE WHO DO IT AS WELL AS THE CLIENTS WE SERVE. I'M NOT A MORE POSITIVE NOTE. I WAS JUST RECENTLY AT ONE OF OUR CLIENTS HOMES WHOM WE HAD HELPED WITH THAT WITH ANOTHER PROGRAM TO GET OUT OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITY HE'D BEEN THERE FOR EIGHT YEARS. BOB DIDN'T WANNA LIVE THERE IT'S A MALE HE'S YOUNG IN A WHEELCHAIR TO THEM HAVE FAMILY AROUND HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES THERE. AND HE TOLD ME YOU KNOW AND HAD TEARS IN HIS EYES THEY SAY WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM SOMETHING TO HELP ME. IN THE COMMUNITY GETTING OUT THERE'D STILL BE IN PRISON THAT RECALL THAT HE SAYS PREDICT I DON'T WANT TO BE THERE. SO PROGRAMS LIKE THIS ARE REALLY WE DO GREAT THINGS FOR PEOPLE AND REALLY HELP WHEN HE ASKED ME TO TAKE. YOU KNOW EVERYBODY FOR YOU KNOW THE GOOD WORK OF. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN HELPING MAKE THAT POSITIVE. DAWN DO YOU HAVE THAT HAPPEN IF HIS LIFE WAS REALLY LIFE CHANGING AND WE'RE GONNA BE THERE TO HELP AND SUPPORT HIM. NO LONGER ZEKE CAN HOPEFULLY TILL. NINA DELUDE PASSES THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THEIR FOURTH NOT EASY WORK BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WORK. AND THEN A FINAL POSITIVE NOTE COME I DID WANT TO SAY THAT. YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SUPPORT THIS. INCREASED. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL MATCH IT. THIS IS THIS IS NOW ONE OF THE ISSUES WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYING NO I DON'T DO THIS THEY WILL MATCHES AT THE PROGRAM. THROUGH MEDICAID. CELL I RAN THE DECISION. TO DO THIS OR NOT RISE AND THE PEOPLE LIVE IN PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK OUR SENIORS DESERVE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LINDA EGGMAN AND I AM A CARE MANAGEMENT SUPERVISOR AT THE MS US P. SITE HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL SENIOR CARE NETWORK IN PASADENA. SERVING THE SAN GABRIEL. AND PROMOTED VALLEY'S. MY PARENTS. RESIDE AND ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO'S. DISTRICT. AND I ONE OF MY ROLES IS. WHAT MY OTHER ROLES IS ALSO A CAREGIVER TO MY PARENTS? I EIGHT. TOTALLY SUPPORT. WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY STATED AND I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THE MS US P.? OF FUNDING REQUEST OF FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. A CAREGIVER YOU NOW THAN. ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF OUR OLDER ADULTS IS SOMETHING VERY DEAR TO ME PERSONALLY. PROFESSIONALLY. OUR CLIENTS I THINK AS DENISE HAD MENTIONED. HAVE MULTIPLE CHRONIC DISEASES AND PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS AND WHEN WE MEET THEM WE. HELP THEM WE HELP OUR CLIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES SUCH AS. LOU A LITTLE TO NO SUPPORT IN PLACE. ARE HOME ALONE. ISOLATION. TOM AND ALSO IN ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SERVICES LIKE DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. IN ORDER TO HELP THEM MANAGE THEIR DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. CLAY CAM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA SOCIALIZATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AND ALSO OUR OWN TRIP AWAY IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL. I'M JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS ONE IS BY DEFINITION THIS PROGRAM SAVE THE STATE MONEY. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON IT ARE ELIGIBLE AND QUALIFIED TO BE IN A NURSING HOME FOR A FRACTION OF THAT COST THEY'RE ALLOWED TO LIVE AT HOME SO BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. SAVINGS TO THE STATE EVERY YEAR THE COST OF STAYING IN NURSING HOMES GOES UP SO IT MAKES NO SENSE NOT TO GIVE A CONSTANT CREES FOR THE PROGRAM. THAT KEEPS PEOPLE OUT OF THOSE NURSING HOME. WHAT WE REALLY NEED ARE MORE MS AS P. SLOTS IN THE STATE BUT THAT OBVIOUSLY CAN'T HAPPEN UNLESS THE EXISTING ONES ARE FUNDED AT A LEVEL AT WHICH THEY CAN SURVIVE SO WE ENCOURAGE?

AND THEN ALSO TO THE POINT OF ISOLATION WE ARE SUCH A LARGE GEOGRAPHY AND SO AGAIN FOR THE FOR FOLKS WHO ARE ON THE VERGE OF BEING. PUT INTO SKILLED NURSING OR SOCIAL WORKERS ARE FOLKS THAT ARE GOING OUT SOMETIMES ONLY ONCE A YEAR IN SOME CASES TWICE A YEAR. THEY MIGHT BE THE ONLY INTERACTION AGAIN YOU KNOW IN THEIR HOME BECAUSE THERE'S TOO FAR OUT TO EVEN GET HOME DELIVERED MEALS SO JUST GOING OUT ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR TO SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING A CHECKING ACCOUNT CARE COORDINATION IS ESSENTIAL. MY LAST POINT IS BECAUSE AGAIN IN A RURAL AREA WE DON'T HAVE MANY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AT ALL. AND WHAT ONES WE DO HAVE ARE ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF CAPACITY AND THAT'S WHAT TRACY BARBARA BEHIND ME IS GOING TO ADDRESS OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. A LOT ABOUT ADDRESSING THAT BUT.

GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE I'M DOCTOR BY REPORTERS SITE DIRECTOR FOR IN MISSISSIPPI CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. I'VE BEEN LISTENING OUTSIDE AND HEARING STORIES HERE I DON'T ENVY YOU. IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE SO MANY MOUTHS TO FEED SO MANY PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORTHY BEYOND EVEN SPEAKING ABOUT. THE ANECDOTAL STORIES GO ON AND ON AND ON I HAD TWO OR THREE PREPARED FOR YOU BUT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE ONE IN PARTICULAR STORY. ONE OF THIS IN ONE OF OUR PARTICULAR CLIENTS. IS A DIALYSIS PRODUCE. AND IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY FOR WHATEVER REASON THERE'S NO TRANSPORTATION BY THE DIALYSIS CLINICS TO GET TO AND FROM. YOU WERE ASKING EARLIER WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECT IF WE DON'T GET THAT FUNDING. ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THIS LADY GOES THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR WEEKS A MONTH. THAT COSTS NOW IS ALMOST A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IN THAT TRANSPORTATION WEARS TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THAT COST WAS MAYBE AROUND A HUNDRED. SO THE INCREASE IN TERMS OF COSTING OF PARROTING THE KIND OF LIFE AND DEATH CARE. IT'S LIFE AND DEATH THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I WOULD BEG YOU REALLY AND TRULY I'M AT THE AGE NOW WHERE I CAN BAG IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL. OF DISLIKE WEARING PURPLE IN DYING YOUR HAIR AFTER GETS GREAT SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THIS THE THOUGHT THAT. BECAUSE ELEMENT WE SAVE MONEY. I WAS NEVER GREAT MATH THAT'S WHY I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGIST SO I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MY MY THAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT. THE PROGRAM FINANCIALLY IS THAT BOTH FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO TAKE CARE OF IN A MISSISSIPPI PERSON. EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH TO PUT THEM IN A SKILLED NURSING SOCIETY NOW I MAY NOT BE REALLY SMART BUT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. I THINK YOU'LL SEE WHAT THE POINT I WAS GETTING AND I WANNA LEAVE YOU WITH ONE LAST THOUGHT. CARE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE CARED FOR UPS. IS ONE OF OUR HIGHEST HONORS LET'S ALL BE HONORABLE THANK YOU. KIM. NANCY MERGED WITH THE CONGRESS OF CALIFORNIA SENIORS AND WE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET REQUEST. FOR ALL OF THE REASONS AND ALL OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE SHARED STORIES. AND DOVE STATISTICS AND ALL OF THAT WE WE RECOGNIZE THIS PROGRAM IS FAR MORE VALUABLE THAN ITS LINE ITEM IN THE BUDGET. YOU CAN'T COMMIT. CAROL SO FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS REQUEST TO HAVE NOTHING TO HAD THANK YOU. A RIGID STRANGE FROM THE OF EMESIS BESIDE DIRECTOR FOR NAPA AND SOLANO COUNTIES. AND. I EXPECT THAT MY SITE WILL CLOSE IF WE DON'T. GET SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING. A EMESIS PIECE OF SORT OF BEEN GETTING IT FROM ALL SIDES FOR AWHILE NOW. A IT'S BECOMING CREASING LEE DIFFICULT TO HIRE QUALIFIED STAFF. THERE ACUITY LEVEL OF THE CLIENTS THAT PARTICIPANTS LA WHERE ROLLING IS HIGHER. WAS SEEING. MORE MORE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THAT. ARE. VERY TIME CONSUMING AND. REQUIRE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE THAT THAT WAS REALLY CHALLENGING FOR A LOT OF OUR PROGRAMS. SO. WE WE. WHEN EMESIS PLEASE GO AWAY OR WHEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ROLLING OVER FROM ONE SITE TO ANOTHER. IT IMPACTS LOTS OF OTHER PROGRAMS TO BECAUSE EMESIS P.. DOES MORE THAN JUST WHAT OUR PROGRAM DOES WE CONNECT HOW PARTICIPANTS WITH AYE CHESS ASKS. WE RESOLVE ISSUES WITH RESURFACED HAITIANS WITH I JUST ASKED WE RESOLVE ISSUES BETWEEN. OPTUS A PRINCE AND THEIR CAREGIVERS TO TRY TO KEEP SOME STABILITY THERE AS THE AVAILABILITY OF CARE GIVERS GOES DOWN AND. WITHIN OUR COUNTIES AT LEAST. ALSO CONNECT PEOPLE WITH MEALS ON WHEELS LEGAL SERVICES AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING IN THE COMMUNITY. SAW EMESIS PETE THEY'LL SERVE SUCH A A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE. ALSO. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR MISSISSIPPI IS WE CAN'T JUST MAKE MORE MONEY BY SERVING MORE PEOPLE. WE CAN'T SAVE MONEY BY HIRING LESS STAFF WE HAVE RATIOS THAT WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN BETWEEN US THE STAFFING. AND THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS THAT WHERE. SERVING. AND WHAT WE CAN DRAW DOWN MORE THAN A HUNDRED PERCENT OF OUR CONTRACT BY SERVING MORE PEOPLE. WE SERVE LESS PEOPLE WE DRAW DOWN LESS FUNDING SO JUST AS A BUSINESS MODEL IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. A TO OPERATE A IN THE FACE OF EVER RISING COSTS FOR REALLY FOR EVERYTHING THAT IT TAKES TO DO BUSINESS THE INSURANCE KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON HIRING STAFF. A. EVERYTHING MILEAGE ALL THAT MUCH WHAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY SUB THANK YOU I HOPE YOU ARE. SERIOUSLY CONSIDER ON SUPPORTING THIS. NATIONAL FUNDING THAT YOU THINK IS OUR.

BUT NEARLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS AND WE'RE ALSO NEMESIS BE PROVIDED WE PROVIDE OF THIS WOULD PROVIDE A MISSISSIPPI SERVICES. TWO FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE CLIENTS AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE BUDGET OF THE RECESSION ERA BUDGET CUTS WE HAVE HAD TO LET GO OF A HUNDRED TWENTY TWO CLIENTS WHICH REPRESENTS A TWENTY PERCENT DECLINE. AND ALSO THEY GOT MANY OTHER CENTERS.

THAT LASTS SEVEN MONTHS I'VE PLOTS FOR A. UP VERY WELL QUALIFIED SOCIAL WORKERS AND HAVE TO HIRE. VERY. IN EXPERIENCE NEW SOCIAL WORKERS TO FILL THE POSITIONS BECAUSE OUR SALARIES ARE NOT COMPETITIVE TO. THE GOING RATE SO ISTRONGLY SUPPORTS THE ALIMENTATION OF FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THINKING. QUICKLY KITANA SENIOR SERVICES COALITION ALAMEDA COUNTY A WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE REQUEST. FOR THE ARE FUNDING FOR MS SP. ALSO WOULD LIKE TO OUR REQUESTS THAT TO A BEHALF OF THE OLDER ADULTS. THAT. WE. THINK ABOUT THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP. AND OUR OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THE LIVES. OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. WANTING TO LIVE IN DIGNITY AND SAFETY. AND HOLY. AS MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THANK YOU. GIVEN. GOOD AFTERNOON LISA COLEMAN WITH CAL COLOR. ONE OF THE TENETS OF THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IS TO ASSIST PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THE LEAST I WE CAN DO ALL THAT THE ADVOCATING FOR THE RESIDENTES FATHER IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. BUT IF THERE ISN'T A PROGRAM TO SUPPORT THEM UPON LEAVING THEY'RE JUST GONNA END UP BACK IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM AND THEY'RE GONNA BE BACK IN THAT SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. SO BECAUSE WE LOOK AT THIS IS A WORK DETERRENT FOREST'S ONE. BUT MORE. IF THE DIGNITY ISSUE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. AND ALSO A COST SAVER TO THE STATE. PLEASE SUPPORT I COMMEND. INTEREST THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS IN SUPPORT. SUSAN OF OURS BUT THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION AS YOU'VE HEARD AND MISSISSIPPI CLIENTS ARE. HAVE VERY COMPLEX CONDITIONS ARM THEIR IMPAIRED AND A MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS. WE SUPPORT THIS REQUEST WE CAME. JOHN POINTER CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE. WHAT OUR PERSONAL LIVES ALL THE ISSUES RAISED TODAY IN MY OPINION IS THAT THE INVOLVE OUR PARENTS? OUR GRANDPARENTS SIBLINGS A CIRCLE OF FRIENDS. I URGE YOU TO WATCH INCREASE THE PROGRAM FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM THANK YOU. SEEN NO MORE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE FOR I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS MANY COMMENTS WE MAY HAVE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO FOGLIGHTS IS. WHAT ELSE CAN WE SAY WE AGREE WITH THE WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN SAID IT'S AND I PARTICULARLY AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT WE CAN SAVE MONEY? ON BY DOING THIS IN THE FRONT AND AND AND UNFORTUNATELY. THE IT SUCH THAT ONE WERE NEGOTIATING. WE CAN'T SHOW. YOU KNOW IT ACTUAL SAVINGS AND AND SO WE YOU KNOW ARE COMMITTED TO TRYING TO GET WHATEVER WE CAN FOR THESE PROGRAMS. SO OBVIOUSLY YOU. CAN A MAN AS YOU CAN IMAGINE DR ARAMBULA FROM FORMER. MEDICAL OF. EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR AND I'M A FORMER TEACHER AND SO IT'S IN OUR NATURE AND IT'S IN OUR. OF PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE LACK OF RESOURCES. AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO. AUGUST TO GET THE RESOURCES AND THE FRONT END SO THAT WE DON'T PAY IT AT THE BACK AND AND THAT'S TRUE IN EMERGENCY ROOMS IT'S DRAWN SCHOOLS AND CLASSROOMS AND. SO KNOW THAT WE WILL GO IN THERE FIGHTING FOR THIS. OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES AS TO WHAT THE RESULT WILL BE BUT WE CAN WE CAN I LEAST I CAN PROMISE THAT WE WILL FIGHT TO GET WHATEVER WE CAN. I'M FOR THE SERVICES AND IT'S. I IT'S BEEN THIS IS MY SECOND YEAR AND JUST LISTENING TO THE STORIES. IT'S HEARTBREAKING IT'S HEARTBREAKING BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT SOMEBODY MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THERE IS A LOT OF MOUTHS TO FEED BUT. I THINK IT'S OUR OBLIGATION TO FEED THOSE THOSE MOUTHS AND SO I THINK WE'RE COMMITTED APPEAR TO. DOING WHAT WE CAN FOR FOR FOR ALL THE PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE ALL WHERE THE PROGRAMS THANK YOU. MY FIRST QUESTIONS CAN BE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES I'M INTERESTED IN HOW. THE EXPERIENCE OF THE MS SP FOUR CONSUMERS WILL BE AFFECTED IN THE TRANSITION. CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US ABOUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU ENVISION. ON THE CHARACTER OF CARE MODEL ON. HOW YOUR TRANSITION PLAN FOSTERS THAT? CERTAINLY AND I THINK THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU'VE ASKED ABOUT THEIR FIRST OF ALL WITH RESPECT TO. WHAT THE CARE MODEL WILL LOOK LIKE WE ACTUALLY ARE ENGAGING IN A MODEL OF CARE WORK GROUP RIGHT NOW THAT'S A PART OF THE MISSISSIPPI TRANSITION WORK GROUP? ON THAT WE ARE ENGAGING IN WHAT THE DEPARTMENT ANY OF AGING AND WITH THEM ASSIST PIECE ITEM WITH MSA AND SO I DON'T WANT TO GET OUT TOO FAR IN FRONT OF MYSELF IN TERMS OF SPEAKING TO WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE. AND CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FACT THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT. AND WHAT WILL THE EXPERIENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL BE EYES THEY ARE IN BOLD OR. AS THEY BECOME A PART OF THE AYE MISSISSIPPI PROGRAM POST THE TRANSITION LOOKING AT WHAT THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE. I'M AND SO REALLY THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY RIGHT NOW WITH RESPECT THE MODEL OF CARE. I'M IN TERMS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH. BENEFICIARIES THAT WOULD BE TRANSITIONING SPECIFICALLY WE ACTUALLY HAVE ISSUED GUIDANCE I THAT WE CALL OUR GRANDFATHER POPULATION SO ESSENTIALLY BENEFICIARIES WILL CONTINUE TO WREAK MAIN. AND WITH THEIR SAME SERVICES AS LONG AS THEY'RE MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES FOR THEM FOR UP TO TWELVE MONTHS ON POST TRANSITION AND FOLLOWING THAT OUR HEALTH PLANS WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THOSE BENEFICIARIES TO. ASSESS THEM AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED TO CONTINUE WITH THOSE SERVICES OR WHETHER OR NOT THERE CARE PLAN WHICH CHANGE. GOOD. FOR THE ADVOCATES ON THE RATE INCREASE YOUR SEEKING. CAN YOU TELL US HOW IT WILL WORK FOR THE COUNTIES WHERE AN SS P. IS TRANSITIONING. AND WHERE IN MISSISSIPPI IS NOT AFFECTED BY THE TRANSITION SO IT BECAUSE. AND THAT IS IT A DISCUSSION THAT OBVIOUSLY IT WAS KIND OF ABOVE US IN TERMS OF HOW DOES THAT MECHANISM WORK IN TERMS OF THE WITH THE MONEY THAT FLOWS FROM THE STATE TO THE HEALTH PLANS. WHO IN THE TRANSITION COUNTIES ARE THE ONES WHO ARE PAIN MSP DIRECTLY NOW? I'M I THINK BUT FOR ME THE BIGGEST THING IS TO KEEP IN MIND IS WE'RE STILL NOT THERE FOR TRANSITION WERE BLEEDING NOW. AND WE'RE AND THE RATE THAT WERE BEING PAID IS THE EXACT SAME RATE TO THAT IF YOU ARE A IF IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS DONE ON A RATE STRUCTURE BASSIST AND WAS A SIMPLE MATH EQUATION TAKING THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS. DIVIDED BY SLOTS KIND OF THING SO IT WOULD WORK AT THE SAME RATE EVERYWHERE SO ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW THE MECHANISM THE STATE WOULD USE. TO GET THAT MONEY DOWN TO US WERE ALL STILL BE PAYMENT PAYING RIGHT NOW AND UNTIL AND THERE'S WE WE'RE NOT IT TRANSITION YET THE EXACT SAME THING AND NEEDING TO KEEP OUR DOORS OPEN. BUT HEALTH BUT DOESN'T SPEAK TO NON. I THINK I WOULD ECHO MARCH CONNELLY REFERENCE THAT. SO MUCH FOCUS AROUND IN MISSISSIPPI OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS HAVE BEEN RELATED TO THE TRACK TRANSITION WITH CCI. AND THAT IN THAT NON TO SEE I COUNTIES AND ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT TODAY ARE STILL VERY REAL AND SO. WHILE THERE ISN'T. A PLAN THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT WOULD. IMPACT THE TRANSITION OF CARE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THE THE FUNDING AUGMENTATION REQUEST IS. AS MUCH A A PRIORITY AND AND NEED FOR THE NONCE HE SAID I COUNTIES IT'S CITIZENS TO TRY COUNTIES THAT. IN SOME WAYS ARGUABLY EVEN MORE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT THERE'S LACK OF CLARITY AS TO WHAT. THINGS WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE ANTI CHECKOUT IS BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY. WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO HOLD ISSUE FOR OPEN AND MOVE ON TO TUITION FIVE THANK YOU FOR THIS PANEL I THINK WE'LL START WITH SUSAN AND GO TO STELLAR IF THAT'S OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND DIRECTOR CALMLY. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING THIS ITEM ON THE AGENDA TODAY. WE APPRECIATE YOUR STAFF WORK ON ON THIS. AM THE ANALYSIS DESCRIBES WHAT THE CONCEPT IS WE WANT TO ESTABLISH A BASELINE OF DEMENTIA CAPABLE AND COMPETENT STAFF. IN ALL THIRTY THREE AREA AGENCY. ON AGING IN OUR STATE. ON THIS IS A ONE TIME FUNDING REQUEST. WE BELIEVE THAT. THE STAFF CAN BE BROUGHT UP TO SPEED AND WE CAN ESTABLISH THAT BASELINE OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD. SO THAT ALL STAFF WILL BE TRAINED THEY'LL HAVE THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND IMPORTANTLY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO REFER INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT WOULD BE ON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR MEMORY. AS WELL AS CARE GIVERS TO THE RISK TO THE APPROPRIATE AND SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. SOME THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM TODAY AS WELL AS THE CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTERS IN THE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE CENTERS IN OUR STATE. I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU. WE HAD A REPORT ISSUED YESTERDAY THAT WAS SHARED WITH ALL OF YOUR OFFICES BET ON THE CHAIR IN PARTICULAR MAY BE INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT. IN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT DOWNSTREAM AND UPSTREAM IN THE BENEFITS OF EARLY DETECTION. CERTAINLY ARE TO. EQUIP INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO AVOID MUCH OF WHAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING IN THIS HEARING ON SO THAT WE CAN BE MORE PROACTIVE. AND PLAN FOR HEALTHCARE. NEEDS. OF ONE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. WE HAD WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WE HAD ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FOR EVERYONE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WE HAD ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. AND TODAY IN THIS COMMITTEE OR NOT TALKING ABOUT. HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION ON THE MEDI CAL SIDE I'M ESPECIALLY WITH HOSPITALIZATIONS. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT EARLY DETECTION WE HOPE ON WITH THIS CAMPAIGN THAT PEOPLE CAN GET DIAGNOSED EARLIER THEY CAN GET CONNECTED TO FREE COMMUNITY RESOURCES. ON THEY CAN EXERCISE THEIR HEALTH LEGAL AND FINANCIAL. DIRECTIVES. THE REPORT THAT WAS ISSUED YESTERDAY THAT WAS SHARED WITH YOUR OFFICES INDICATES THAT EARLY DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS NATIONWIDE. CAN SAVE OUR COUNTRY SEVEN POINT NINE TRILLION DOLLARS IF WE GET THIS RIGHT. ON CALIFORNIA'S IS ONE OF FIFTY STATES. LESS THAN HALF OF PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH THAT DIAGNOSIS DOCUMENTED IN THEIR MEDICAL RECORD THAT'S A NATIONWIDE STATISTIC. ON BUT WE HAVE THE LARGEST POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY HERE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. I AM I WANTED TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUE AND I DON'T WANNA TALK ANY FURTHER BUT STELLA DE LA PENA. WORKS FOR THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION AND SHE SERVES. AS OUR REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY CHAPTER. GOOD AFTERNOON TO ALL OF YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. PLAN TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION AND TODAY WITH YOU AND I ACTUALLY HAVE NOT COME ALONE SO AND I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO. MY FATHER WHO. I THINK WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE. AND ANYONE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIM AND MY FATHER AND DIED FROM ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. HE WAS EIGHTY THREE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME WE LEARNED ABOUT HIS DISEASE SHORTLY AFTER A CRISIS WHEN HE WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US. AND HE WAS TAKEN FROM US BY THE POLICE BY OUR LOCAL POLICE AND EVER ALLOWED TO RETURN HOME AGAIN. MY DAD HAD PROBLEMS WITH MEMORY AND JUDGMENT FIVE YEARS PRIOR. HE HAD BECOME LOST FREQUENTLY AND HE HALLUCINATED. AND FOR YEARS AND REGULAR VISITS TO OUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS THE USUALLY RESULTED IN COMMENTS ABOUT BOLDLY. AND VERY MINIMAL SUPPORT AND EDUCATION. ON THE DAY OF OF THE CRISIS MY SISTER WAS DRIVING HIM TO ETERNAL APPOINTMENT THEY STOPPED AT A RAILROAD CROSSING. AND THE NOISE OF THE TRAINS STARTLED HIM. HE BECAME AGITATED UNWANTED EXIT THE DOOR. MY SISTER TRIED TO RESTRAIN HIM FROM LEAVING THE CAR AND HE BEGAN TO HIT HER. A POLICE OFFICER ALSO STOPPED AT THE RAILROAD CROSSING. SAW MY FATHER HITTING MY SISTER. SO HE APPROACHED THE CAR QUICKLY AND. HE REMOVED MY FATHER THREW HIM AGAINST THE CAR AND HANDCUFFED HIM. MY SISTER TRIED TO INTERVENE AND TOLD THE OFFICER. SEC SCARED. AND THE OFFICERS REPLY WAS. I AM TAKING THEM. IN OR I AM TAKING THEM TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM YOU CHOOSE. AND SO HE WAS TAKEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. AFTER THREE DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER NUMEROUS TESTS. WE WERE TOLD THAT HE HAD ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. HE WAS THEN DISCHARGED TO A FIFTY BAD ASSISTED LIVING COMMUNITY THAT AT THE TIME ONLY HAD TWO STAFF MEMBERS. WHO HAD BEEN TRAINED TO ASSIST PATIENTS WITH MEMORY? AND ISSUES. MY FATHER LIVED TWO YEARS IN THE COMMUNITY BEFORE HE DIED. HE DECLINED VERY QUICKLY THE FIRST YEAR. LOS TOP OF ITS WAY AND IN THE LAST YEAR HE DIDN'T KNOW HIS FAMILY. THIS DEVASTATED OUR FAMILY IMMENSELY MY MOTHER IN THAT TIME HAD TWO STROKES. OUR LIVES WERE TURNED COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN TRYING TO BE INVOLVED. IN HIS LIFE AND IN HIS NEW CARE SETTING. TO THIS DAY I BELIEVE IN MY HEART. THAT. OUR DADS QUALITY OF LIFE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LENGTH OF HIS LIFE. AND THE QUALITY OF OUR LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT IN THOSE FIVE YEARS HAD WE KNOWN. ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. AND HAD A BETTER SUPPORT HIS DISEASE PROCESS AT HOME. EVEN HOW TO ADD TO THE ENRICHMENT OF HIS VERY FINAL YEARS IN THE COMMUNITY HOME. MAINTAINING HIS DIGNITY WHICH WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM. MY MOM IS NOW IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF DEMENTIA. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW. ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE THIS EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN VERY DIFFERENT FOR OUR FAMILY. WE ARE PREPARING NOW FOR WHAT WE KNOW WILL COME. I FEAR TO. THAT I WILL GET THIS DISEASE AND I WANT MY CHILDREN TO BE INFORMED. AM PREPARED. I HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. I'VE HAD A STROKE I'VE HAD A BRAIN INJURY. I AM A WOMAN. AND I AM LATINA. ALL OF THESE THINGS INCREASE MY WRISTS FOR GETTING THIS DISEASE AND I AM SCARED. IN MY WORK IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I SEE THE DIFFERENCE ON A DAILY BASIS THE FAMILIES WHO WALKIN. IN CRISIS I SEE THEM BROKEN AND LOST JUST LIKE MY FAMILY ROOTS. AND I SEE THE TIME THAT IT TAKES TO GET THEM TO BEGIN TO RECOVER FROM THE IMPACT. SOME NEVER DO. THE ROAD IS LONG AND IT'S HARD. SPENCER. MANY WITH INCREASED HEALTH ISSUES OF THEIR OWN BECAUSE OF THE DEMANDS OF CAREGIVING TO DO THEIR VERY FAST. ALMOST ALWAYS. I HERE OUR STAFF HERE'S I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT YOU I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. I WOULD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO DIFFERENT. AND I SEE THE DIFFERENCE THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN FAMILIES WHO COME MEAN EVEN WITH VERY BASIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DISEASE. AND WHAT IT MAKES. WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKES IN THEIR OWN LIVES AND IN THEIR FAMILY'S LIVES? IN THEIR HOPE AN INTER DESIRE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DISEASE AND HOW THEY CAN BETTER SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY MEMBER AND THEIR LOVED ONE. THEY ARE PROACTIVE IN THEIR LOVED ONES CARE THEY ADVOCATE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES THEY PREPARE THE ATTEND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO LEARN TO BE BETTER CARE GIVERS. AND THE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO LEARN HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. AND THIS GREATLY IMPACTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF EVERYONE INVOLVED. ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY MY DAD IS NO LONGER WITH US. I'M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO INCREASE EDUCATION ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE DESPERATELY NEED AT. THERE'S TOO MUCH DEVASTATION ACCOUNT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF AWARENESS MY STORY I I WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS. A VERY UNUSUAL STORY. IT IT'S NOT WE HEAR CRISIS EVERYDAY ON FROM FAMILIES THAT WALKING TO OUR OFFICE. AND WE HEAR THEM TOO OFTEN AND TOO MANY. SO I AM HERE TO PASS AND AND I BELIEVE THERE WAS SANDBAGGING EARLIER SO I AM WILLING TO BACK MYSELF. INTO BAG THAT YOU THAT YOU CONSIDER SUPPORTING. OUR REQUEST FOR FUNDING. BIGGEST VILLAIN SUSAN DIRECTOR CALMLY. S. LIKE THAT I THINK THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION HAS REALLY SPOKEN QUITE ELOQUENTLY TO THE ON. THE POPULATION IMPACTS BOTH IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY IMPACTED. ON I'M HAVING A LITTLE HARD TIME HER MYSELF MY DAD WOULD UP IN NINETY SEVEN. THIS WEEK AND. AFTER A STROKE I HAD HAD. DEVELOPED ALZHEIMER'S. ON AND WE CARE FOR HIM WERE ABLE TO CARE FOR HIM AT HOME FOR FIVE YEARS AND IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THOSE WEEKS. AT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT CERTAINLY IMPACTS ALL FAMILIES I THINK THROUGHOUT THE STATE. A JUST IN TERMS OF REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL I KNOW IT'S INTENDED TO BE A ONE TIME ONLY IN TERMS OF AND THE FUNDING. ON WITH A TWO YEAR TIME TIMEFRAME. ON THERE ARE STILL. LOTS I THINK IN TERMS OF MOVING PARTS IN THE PROPOSAL. ON MY JUST BASIC KIND OF LOOKING AT FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE SEEMS TIMING WISE ANGER TALK ABOUT CONTRACTING AND OTHER. PROPHECIES AND AT AN EARLIER SEGMENT PROBABLY CLOSER TO TWO AND A HALF TO THREE YEARS JUST IN TERMS OF. SOME OF THOSE PIECES ARMED TO THE PROPOSAL BUT I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND PARTLY TO FINANCE AND. THE ADVOCATES IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THIS WEEK. LL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WELL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE FIVE. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN GERALD KELCH. BUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. WE'RE EXCITED TO BE WORKING WITH IMPARTING WITH ALZHEIMER'S CALIFORNIA ON THIS BUDGET REQUEST. YOU KNOW THE ME SHARE THAT INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE HAS ONE OF THE CORD MANDATES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. HEAD OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WERE NO TO SEE. THAT MORE AND MORE CALLS TO OUR HANEY PROGRAMS HAS TO DO WITH ALZHEIMER'S. IT'S SOMETHING NOW LIKE FORTY PERCENT OF THE BECAUSE OF WHERE RECEIVING. A ON THESE A CUP ON THESE TELEPHONE CALLS A HAS TO DO WITH ALZHEIMER'S. THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE USED HIS IS A NATURAL ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE ALZHEIMER'S OR ORGANIZATIONS AND AN AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. WHAT IT DOES IS BRING THE STRENGTHS OF BOTH COMMUNITIES TOGETHER? HA HA OUR NETWORK IN TERMS OF OF OUT REACH. TO THE COMMUNITY THE FACT THAT WE'RE GET THESE PHONE CALLS. AND THEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH THE EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE. AND THE EXPERTISE OF THE ALZHEIMER'S ORGANIZATIONS. A. YOU KNOW THAT HIT HERE. CONSULTANT INDICATED NINE LIKE TO READ THAT THIS BUILDS ON THE LOCAL CAPACITY TO PROMOTE EARLY DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS. OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. TO AN EVIDENCE BASED INFORMED ME BASS. A PUBLIC OUTREACH INITIATIVE AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IT'S QUITE SIMPLE. SO WE RESPECTIVELY REQUEST THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BUDGET REQUEST. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MY NAME IS JACKIE COLEMAN. A A RP STANDS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS ALZHEIMER'S BUDGET REQUEST. AND URGES YOUR SUPPORT. I AM A VOLUNTEER FOR A A RP CALIFORNIA. I WAS RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH DEMENTIA. I HAVE FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE. WITH HOW IMPORTANT EARLY DETECTION IS AN ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA IT'S CRITICAL. IT HAS ALLOWED ME TO PLAN FOR MY FUTURE. LEARN ABOUT MY CONDITION. MAKE LIFESTYLE CHANGES. AND IT HAS GIVEN ME A NEW LEASE ON LIFE. AS I NOW WANT TO SHARE WHAT I'VE LEARNED WITH OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE RECEIVED A SIMILAR DIAGNOSIS. THINKING THANK YOU MA'AM. CAROL SO FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION IN THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. AS DIRECTOR TOLD SAID THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THE FIRST LINE OF INFORMATION. FOR PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE LOOKING FOR SERVICES THE AREA AGENCY IS THEIR AND PROVIDES OF INVALUABLE SERVICE. GIVING THEM THE ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS FUNDING WILL BRING. TO WORK WITH THE GROWING NUMBER OF FAMILIES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE SEEING. I THINK IS ESSENTIAL SO WE HARDLY ARCH SUPPORT. BECAME. PLEASE A COLEMAN WITH CAL COLOR. WELL YES THE ASSOCIATION IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS THIS IS FOR UP FOR MY FAMILY IT'S A PERSONAL ISSUE. MY HUSBAND'S AUNT. WHILE SHE HAD SYMPTOMS AND HER DOCTOR I UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE HAD SENT HIM SHE NEVER GOT A DIAGNOSIS. AND BY THE TIME SHE GOT A DIAGNOSIS AND FAMILY GOT INVOLVED I CAME TO VISIT HER TO FIND ROTTEN FOOD. BILLS NOT PAID. MORE THAN A THIRD OF HER FINANCIAL SAVINGS WAS GONE. AND I THINK FOR ME IS AN OMBUDSMAN THE HARDEST PART WAS. HER COGNITIVE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT STEPS OF HER LIFE FOR GONE WE CAME TOO LATE TO ASK HER WHAT IS YOUR PREFERENCE.

I BEFORE YOUR DAY SPEAK TO THE CSL THREE YEAR FINANCING PLAN. YOU HAVE EACH RECEIVED A COPY OF. THERE WAS THREE ISSUES THE PLAN WAS TO ADDRESS CIALIS TAKEN ACTION ON ALL THREE ISSUES. AS THE PLAN OUTLINES. MY PRESENTATION TODAY WILL FOCUS ON OUR PROPOSED SOLUTION TO FUNDING SEE YOURSELF FOR THE FUTURE. OUR PROPOSALS OUTLINING THE PCP IT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO DEAL EFFORT FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE PROPOSAL SPEAKS TO A TWO TWO TIERED FUNDING PROCESS. FIXED NOT DISCRETIONARY EXPENSES WILL BE FUNDED USING GENERAL FUNDS. DISCRETIONARY EXPENSES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH CO SOUTH AFRICA SEE. AND LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS WILL BE FUNDED. FROM THE TAX CHECKOFF PROGRAM. ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE THREE YOUR FINANCING PLAN CURRENT AN ESTIMATED EXPENSES. ARGENTA FIGHT FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AS WELL AS TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN TO ONE. THE LETTER TO YOUR SUPPORT TRADE USING THE TWO TIER FUNDING SYSTEM. LET ME BRIEFLY I PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE ISSUE OF FUNDING. IN JULY TWENTY FOURTEEN SEE YOURSELF COMPLETED REPORT. UNFUNDED CSL THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THE REPORT WAS A RESULT OF A CLIENT TAX CHECKOFF DONATIONS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN. THE FOCUS WAS ON ADDITIONAL REVENUE SOURCES. AS WELL AS IMPROVING DONATIONS TO SEE A CELL. TAX CHECKOFF FUND. WE'VE PURSUED SOME OF THOSE APPROACHES HOWEVER. THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE TAX CHECK OFF IS OUR BEST SOURCE OF FUNDING. THIS YOURSELF PARTICIPATE IN THE TAX CHECKOFF SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. IT'S BEEN THE PRIMARY FUNDING TRAIN FOR CO CELL DURING THE ENTIRE HISTORY AS A STATE AGENCY. A HISTORY OF DONATIONS OVER THREE DECADES HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN THE THREE YEAR FINANCING PLAN. AS THE FINANCING PLAN NOTES. SOMETHING CHANGED HOWEVER IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. CONTRIBUTIONS FELL TO TO LEARN THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS. NCSL FELL BELOW THE MINIMUM CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT CAN NEVER EXCEEDED. THAT AMOUNT AGAIN. FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IT ALSO SOUGHT DONATIONS FALL EIGHTY ONE PERCENT. FROM TWENTY ELEVEN. THE TWENTY FOURTEEN EIGHTY ONE PERCENT. AND THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD CANNOT TELL US WHY. DONATIONS OF CONTINUE DEFAULT OF TWENTY SIXTEEN FIGURE OF SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB FIVE NINETEEN WHICH RETURN HIMSELF OF A TAX CHECK OFF. CFL CONTRACTED WITH A VENDOR. WITH A NINETY FOUR PERCENT PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION RATIO WITHOUT AND BRADSTREET. TO DEVELOP AN AWARENESS CAMPAIGN DURING THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN TAX PROVINCE. JANUARY PAPER RESULTS ARE AVAILABLE AND WE'RE PROJECTING DONATIONS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR. WILL BE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND. SO WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS SO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BUT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. I LIKED TO NEXT SPEAK TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS PROPERTY. THE OUT. UP GOING TO MORE TAP YOU'RE JUST A SECOND LAST YEAR ABOUT THIS TIME. YOU MISTER CHAIR DIRECTED DEAL F. NCSL. FIND A SOLUTION FUNDING CSL. THE EFFORTS OF A TEAM OF CFL DEAL OFTEN ALEJO RESULTED IN SOME SAVINGS AND STREAMLINING ORGANIZATIONAL. AND PROGRAM ACTIVITIES. IT DID NOT FIND A SOLUTION TO THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. AND THAT HEALTH FITNESS FIXED COSTS THAT MAKE UP. CMP ASSN PRO RATA. FEES AND SALARY AND BENEFITS. CFL WAS FACED WITH THE FOLLOWING SIXTY NINE PERCENT. CSL PROJECTED EXPENDITURES AND TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN OR STATE FEES. AS WELL AS SALARY AND BENEFITS EACH YEAR THE CITY'S TAKEN EVER INCREASING PORTION OF THE CSL BUDGET AS DEMONSTRATED IN THE TABLE. ON PAGE FIVE WITH A THREE YEAR FINANCING PLAN. FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FIVE YEARS CMP ES HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED. IF THIS TREND CONTINUES IMPROVE THE NPS IS PROJECTED TO DOUBLE AGAIN. WITHIN THAT WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THESE FEES ARE COMPLYING WITH SALARY AND BENEFITS SIMPLY CONSUME. THE BUDGET OF CSL IN THE FUTURE THE SOLUTION. THE CHALLENGE RAISING DONATIONS TO STAY AHEAD. OF THESE CONTINUALLY ESCALATING FEES HE COMES OVERWHELMING. SEE YOURSELF. NO ORGANIZATION CAN SURVIVE ON DISCRETIONARY SPENDING THAT IS TO CONTINUE THIS CLAWING EACH SUBSEQUENT YEAR. SO THE SENIOR FELLOW SUBMITTED A PCP. ARE THAT SPEAKS TO CMP* AS WELL AS PRO RATA. AND TALKS TO PERMIT STATE EMPLOYEE SALARY AND BENEFITS. AS I OUT NOTED EARLIER TALKS THE FIXED NON DISCRETIONARY EXPENSES. AND ALSO DISCRETIONARY EXPENSES ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE THREE YEAR FINANCING PLAN. CURRENT ESTIMATED EXPENSES ARE GONNA FIGHT AS I'VE ALREADY NOTED FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. SO WHAT ARE FIX NON DISCRETIONARY EXPENSES AS I NOTED EARLIER SALARY AND BENEFITS. IT ALSO STATE FEES. M. THE THREE YEAR PLAN SALARY AND BENEFITS JUST HAVE RISEN BUT THEY'VE RISEN BECAUSE OF. STEPPING PRIESTS IS COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS AND THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF BENEFITS. STATE FEES WERE FORTY THREE THOUSAND. NINE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE DOLLARS. TWENTY ELEVEN TWELVE. THEY OUR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND FIFTY DOLLARS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. WE'RE PROJECTING MAYES COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO ESCALATE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. DISCRETIONARY EXPENSES INVOLVE OPERATING COSTS THAT'S INVOLVED PRINTING POSTAGE. COMMUNICATION INSURANCE IT CETERA AND EMISSIONS ESSENTIAL TASKS ARE REALLY WHAT OUR CORE MISSION IS. AND THAT'S INVOLVED WITH LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. AND IN THE PROCESS INVOLVES LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS ARE REVIEWED IT SUBMITTED IN JUNE THE ANNUAL SESSION CONDUCTED OCTOBER EACH YEAR'S IDENTIFIES OUR TOP TEN. AND FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM WE SHOPPED THOSE TOP TEN LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS DURING THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION. I IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY. CONCLUSION. SO IN CONCLUSION. CSL IS TAKEN A NUMBER STEPS TO ADDRESS REVENUE EXPENSES. WE HAVE STREAMLINED SOME PROCESSES AND WE SEE IMPROVEMENT TAX CHECK OFF. HOWEVER AS I NOTED IT. EARLIER THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS STATE FEES. THE REALITY IS THAT SEE US OUT IN RETURN DONATIONS TO PRE TWENTY THIRTEEN LEVELS. AND ALWAYS SEE NON DISCRETIONARY SPENCER'S CONSUME MORE AND MORE THE BUDGET EACH YEAR. SO OUR INTENT IS TO PROVIDE RELIEF FROM INCREASING FIX NON DISCRETIONARY COSTS OR EXPENSES. THAT NOW REPRESENT SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF SEE YOURSELF EXPENDITURES SINCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. STIR JOINT RULES COMMITTEE CHAIR AS WELL. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ILIO. YES WE ARE KERN REFUSING THESE PROPOSALS BY THE SPRING BUDGET PROCESS SO WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SHARE AT THIS TIME. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ONE. SEEING NONE I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS IF I CAN. FIRST OF ALWAYS BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE PROPOSAL'S MISTER POINTER THAT YOU BRING FORWARD CAN YOU LIST A FEW OF THE LEGISLATIVE VICTORIES THAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. ARE. LET ME LET ME SUMMARIZE THEM ARE A COUPLE OF THE COUPLE HERE QUICKLY MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS ESP ONE FORTY SEVEN. ALLOWS A HOMEOWNER TO. DESIGNATE ONE OTHER PERSON TO SHARE MOBILE HOME. THEIR MOBILE HOME WITHOUT A FEE INCREASE. AB. X. TO FIFTEEN. END OF LIFE. I DON'T THINK THAT NEEDS ANY ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION. AB SIX FORTY THREE SILVER ALERT. THE EQUIVALENT OF AMBER ALERT. AB NINE EIGHTEEN EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES. TO MOBILIZE AND EVACUATE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN EACH COMMUNITY. ARE. AND THEN THERE'S A NUMBER HERE INVOLVING ELDER ABUSE AND IDENTITY THEFT. OUR A BEACH SIX TWENTY SIX TWENTY THREE A. B.. THIRTY THREE THIRTY TWO AND THEN AB ONE THIRTY EIGHT ELDER ECONOMIC PLANNING THAT. REQUIRED A STATE PLAN ON AGING. TO UTILIZE AN ELDER INDEX AS A REFERENCE AND. ESTIMATING COSTS OF. BASIC NEEDS. I ALSO HAVE AND WILL BE HAPPY TO SEND TO. YOU MISTER CHAIR OF A SUMMARY OF OUR LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN INTO LAW. THAT GO ON THE WAY BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO GREAT I. I HAVE ALWAYS APPRECIATED THE COMMITMENT INVOICE THAT YOU ADD ON TO OUR BODY HERE. AND SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE A CAN A SUGGESTION FOR CONSIDERATION HERE. WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER ABSORBING THE ONE POSITION AND AND IT WOULD COME WITH FUNDING FOR ASSOCIATED COSTS. CURRENTLY STAFFING THE CSL INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. IT. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD MUCH TIME YEAH I'M TO REALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. BUT JUST KIND OF AT A HIGH LEVEL. A ONE OF THE AREAS I THINK IN YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE MISSION OF CSL. IT'S FAIRLY CLICK VERY CLEARLY FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING LEGISLATION. FORMULATING THAT SHOPPING IT AS YOU WERE IN THE TERM THAT YOU USE TO THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTLY. THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT WE WORK ON LEGISLATION AND THE VARIOUS STEPS THAT WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. IN TERMS OF EVEN IF IT ISN'T ADMINISTRATION SPONSORED BILL AND WORKING WITH. WITH LEGISLATORS AND COMMITTEES SO. UP I HAVE JUST SOME KIND OF AT A HIGH LEVEL CONCERNED ABOUT ROLE CONFUSION OR WHERE. YOU KNOW HOW WOULD WHAT WE MIGHT DO IN THAT. CAPACITY DIFFER FROM WHAT DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES IS CURRENTLY DOING AND TERMS OF JUST STRAIGHT. ADMIN SUPPORT. FOUR CSL. IN TERMS OF THOSE IN TERMS OF THAT WORK AND WHAT THE WHAT THE VALUE ADDED IS. AND KEEPING THE INDEPENDENCE OF CSL. AND AS I'M IN GOOD KEEPING WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF PROPHECIES. JUST START OUT. THERE THIS WAS A QUESTION ASKED IN THE SRL IN IT IF THERE WAS ANY DEPARTMENT THAT COULD DO THIS AND. I UNDERSTAND THAT NO DEPARTMENT STEPPED UP. CDA FEELS LIKE THE. NATURAL PLACE I. THEY GOT THAT AGING IN OUR NAY. WELL IS THE FUNDING WITH THE POSITION THE KEY ISSUE HERE YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE IT'S THE INDEPENDENCE. THE WHAT IT IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING OF THE POSITION. IF IT WERE JUST DOING THAT ADMINISTRATIVE WORK. AND IN A SENSE IN A WAY IT SEEMS. CLEANER. JUST IN TERMS OF THE INDEPENDENCE IF IT CONTINUED TGS NOW I'M SPEAKING TOTALLY YOU KNOW OFF THE. THE CHART HERE IN TERMS OF JUST. AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION. ONCE IT COMES IN TO THE TO YOU KNOW WORK TO COME INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. IN TERMS OF THE LEGISLATIVE WORK THAT WE DO. WHERE IS THE WORST TECH RADIATION BEGAN AND TERMS HAVE? MICHAEL ASSISTANCE. THE M. THE INDEPENDENCE KIND OF THE FIREWALL BETWEEN ONE ORGANIZATION AND THE OTHER SO THAT THAT'S JUST KIND OF HIGH LEVEL. THINKING. NOT AND OTHERS I HAVE HAD IF I CAN I WE DON'T NEED A FINAL ANSWER TODAY BUT IF THERE'S A POSSIBILITY FOR US TO ENGAGE IN THIS DISCUSSION. IT'S COUPLE FOR US TO CONSIDER AND. NAM AGAIN IT'S JUST A SUGGESTION BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A NATURAL SATIN ONE THAT WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE SOME. ROGER CHAIR. OF FIRST THAT I APOLOGIZE FOR PLACING YOU IN THE HOT SEAT HERE TODAY UP. OF THAT THE KIDS IN ON PATTERSON TO. MY BACKGROUND IS THIRTY SIX YEARS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AT. I DIDN'T WORK IN WASHINGTON DC BUT I HAD A TOP LEVEL POSITION. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE SO I'VE GOT SOME EXPERIENCE NO ONE. WANTS TO BE. ARE UNLOADED ON IT I'VE BEEN IN THAT CHAIR MYSELF AND YOU KNOW AGAIN THE. YOU WANT DO WHAT. MENTALITY SEEPS IN IMMEDIATELY UP BUT PERHAPS IF WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN AND AND. AND INTERACT AND HAVE SOME DISCUSSION MAYBE THERE ARE SOME COMMON GROUND MAYBE WAS SIMPLY CHECK THAT'S WHAT OFFICE WELL AS. THAT'S NOT AN OPTION. ARE EITHER. AND WILL CONTINUE TO TRY AND PURSUE THIS AND I WILL BE BACK HERE NEXT YEAR ARE IF NECESSARY ORDER TO FIND THE SOLUTION TO THE FUNDING. BUT PERHAPS THAT MIGHT BE ONE OPTION A WE MIGHT LOOK AT. AS WELL. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WITH THAT A THAT WILL WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND THAT WILL CONCLUDE TODAY'S HEARING THANK YOU ALL FOR ATTENDING. YOU. MAKING IT ALL INCOME
