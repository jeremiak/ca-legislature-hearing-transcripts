SCIENCE DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT AS

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:33.418
A MATTER OF FACT IT'S THE

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:35.153
OPPOSITE I'M AGAINST THE PARTS

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.689
OF THE BILL THE CALL ON A

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:39.091
RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND PASTORS

00:22:39.157 --> 00:22:43.128
AND CHURCHES SPECIFICALLY TO

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:44.830
TAKEN AFFIRMING POSITION ON

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:47.899
LGBT ISSUES WHEN OUR FAITH

00:22:47.966 --> 00:22:49.167
COUNSELS US IN A DIFFERENT

00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:50.602
DIRECTION SO WE'RE NOT AGAINST

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:52.037
LOVE WERE NOT AGAINST

00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:53.872
COMPASSION. WE JUST HAVE A

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:56.241
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON SEXUAL

00:22:56.308 --> 00:22:59.578
ISSUES AND SO IT'S NOT THE JOB

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:01.246
OF THE STATE TO TELL THE CHURCH

00:23:01.313 --> 00:23:02.881
WHAT TO BELIEVE OR HOW TO

00:23:02.948 --> 00:23:04.883
COUNSEL I DON'T SEE THAT IN THE

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:05.650
RESOLUTE WHAT YOU JUST

00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:07.452
DESCRIBED AS SIMPLY DON'T SEE

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:08.620
THAT IN THE RESOLUTION THAT'S

00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:10.455
WHY I WAS ASKING ABOUT SPECIFIC

00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:12.557
PORTIONS THAT YOU DISAGREED

00:23:12.624 --> 00:23:15.727
WITH SO FOR EXAMPLE IT CALLS

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:17.262
UPON RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO MODEL

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:18.697
EQUITABLE TREATMENT OF ALL

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:22.033
PEOPLE OF THE STATE OR- THAT

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:22.634
WHEN YOU'RE OPPOSED TO DO NOT

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:27.706
NOT AT ALL. AS A MATTER OF FACT

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:29.274
WE'RE FOR LOVE WERE FOR

00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:29.875
COMPASSION WERE FOR EQUITABLE

00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:30.742
TREATMENT. WE JUST BELIEVE THAT

00:23:30.809 --> 00:23:31.643
THE STATE. THIS IS THE FIRST

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:32.944
BILL THAT I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY

00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:33.545
TWENTY FIVE YEARS INSTEAD OF

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:36.481
CALIFORNIA. WHERE SPECIFICALLY

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:37.716
EVEN THOUGH TO RESOLUTION IT

00:23:37.783 --> 00:23:39.151
DOESN'T HAVE BINDING AFFECTING

00:23:39.217 --> 00:23:41.386
TEETH. IT CALLS OUT CHURCHES

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:42.821
AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO TAKE A

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:44.956
SPECIFIC. PERSPECTIVE ON

00:23:45.023 --> 00:23:46.758
MORALITY AND SEXUALITY HUMAN

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:48.894
SEXUALITY AND THAT IS NOT THE

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.896
JOB OF THE STATE AND SO AS A

00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:53.198
RESOLUTION OF THE STATE. EVEN

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:54.766
BILLS THAT DON'T HAVE TEETH

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:56.334
BILLS THAT CHILL RELIGIOUS FREE

00:23:56.401 --> 00:23:58.436
EXERCISE OR BILLS THAT CHILL

00:23:58.503 --> 00:24:00.806
RELIGIOUS SPEECH. ARE ALSO

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.607
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE COURT

00:24:02.674 --> 00:24:05.911
SAID LAST YEAR IN THE CASES OUT

00:24:05.977 --> 00:24:07.212
OF COLORADO I CITED EARLIER.

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:10.315
THE EVEN SUBTLE DEPARTURES FROM

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:11.449
NEUTRALITY OF THE STATE TOWARDS

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:13.552
RELIGIOUS GROUPS. IS

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:15.554
UNCONSTITUTIONAL THIS IS MORE

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.522
THAN JUST SUBTLE. LACK OF

00:24:17.589 --> 00:24:18.890
NEUTRALITY TOWARDS RELIGIOUS

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:20.358
BELIEFS AND PRACTICES IT'S

00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:22.527
SPECIFICALLY TELLING US WHAT TO

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:24.729

00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:27.532
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THANK YOU

RESPECT TO THE GENTLEMEN I

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:34.639
THINK HERE. IT WOULD LIMIT

00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:36.741
OTHER PEOPLE'S FREEDOM TO BE

00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:38.944
ABLE TO THINK THAT FAME COUNCIL

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:39.845
WE BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT FOR

00:24:39.911 --> 00:24:42.547
CHOICE. SO IF I AM OR IF MY

00:24:42.614 --> 00:24:44.115
GRANDCHILDREN I USE THAT AGAIN

00:24:44.182 --> 00:24:45.417
AS AN EXAMPLE A PROBLEM MOTHER

00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:46.785
OF TWO AND TWO GRANDCHILDREN.

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:48.420
IF THEY WERE IN THE LGBT

00:24:48.486 --> 00:24:50.522
COMMUNITY I WOULD WANT THEM TO

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:52.324
HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SEEK

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.459
RELIGIOUS COUNCIL THAT ALIGNS

00:24:54.526 --> 00:24:55.660
WITH THEIR VALUES AND BELIEF

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:57.195
SYSTEM. AND THIS WOULD TAKE

00:24:57.262 --> 00:24:58.830
THAT AWAY FROM THEM WE'RE NOT

00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:00.031
SAYING THERE WERE OPPOSED TO

00:25:00.098 --> 00:25:01.399
ANYONE THAT WE DON'T LOVE OF

00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:03.535
COURSE WE DO BUT WE ALSO WANT

00:25:03.602 --> 00:25:05.403
THE RIGHT. FOR THOSE WHO SAY I

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:23.521
RIGHT TO DO THAT. ADAM CHAIR

00:25:23.588 --> 00:25:25.056
ALL OF US HERE. OF COME TO THIS

00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:25.757

EXPERIENCES TO OUR PERSPECTIVE.

00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:28.460
AND I THINK ALL OF US BELIEVE

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:29.060
THAT THE STATE HAS A DUTY TO

00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:30.595
PROTECT CERTAIN CITIZENS AND I

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:32.831
COME HERE WITH THE PERSPECTIVE.

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:34.366
FROM WATCHING MY BROTHER IN LAW

00:25:40.071 --> 00:25:42.374
FAMILY. SO I BELIEVE THE STATE

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.875
DOES HAVE A VERY STRONG

00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:45.644
INTEREST IN PREVENTING THAT

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:46.878

00:26:06.364 --> 00:26:06.865
PARAGRAPH BECAUSE IT WAS A-

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:08.400
KIND THE PARAGRAPH THAT ICE

00:26:08.466 --> 00:26:10.835

WHICH IN MY EXPERIENCE AS A

00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:24.049
FORMER PASTOR. MOST MOST OF THE

FOLKS THAT I KNOW IN THAT

00:26:25.183 --> 00:26:26.584
PROFESSION TO COME FROM THAT

00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:28.820
ANGLE OF LOVE AND COMPASSION

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:30.889
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE-

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:32.557
EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF THE OF THE

AND THEN SENATOR RUSSELL.

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:37.255
FIGURE CHAIRWOMAN. I THINK THE

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:38.757
FACT THIS IS A RESOLUTION AS

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:41.126
OPPOSED TO. A SUBSTANTIVE PIECE

00:27:41.192 --> 00:27:44.129
OF LEGISLATION SPEAKS VOLUMES

00:27:44.195 --> 00:27:45.497
BUT UNFORTUNATE THINK WHEN WE

00:27:45.563 --> 00:27:47.265

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:50.235
TOPICS YOU KNOW EVEN SYMBOLIC.

00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:53.104
ON DISCUSSIONS TAKE ON GRAVITY.

MINISTER IS THAT CORRECT IT'S

00:28:07.085 --> 00:28:08.953

BE THAT WORKS FOR SOME MAYBE

00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:18.056
NOT FOR EVERYONE BUT THE ISSUE

00:29:18.123 --> 00:29:18.690
HERE AT LEAST IN MY OPINION. IS

00:29:18.756 --> 00:29:22.093
THAT. WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.429
THAT THERE IS A FREEDOM OF

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:24.996
RELIGION AND THEN THERE'S A

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:28.099
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. AND SO

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:31.169
FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT. WELL I

DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT IT I

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:37.308
MUST CONFESS MAYBE IT IS STRICT

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:40.411
MAYBE IT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

00:29:40.478 --> 00:29:43.081
AYE I'M NOT IN THE FIELD OF

00:29:43.148 --> 00:29:45.216
THAT AREA OF STUDY. BUT JUST

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:47.018
REMAIN FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

00:29:47.085 --> 00:29:48.620

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:14.539
ETHICAL AND HARMFUL SO THIS IN

WE DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE.

00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:03.688
THESE DISCUSSIONS AND THAT WE

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:06.658
CAN FORMALLY HAVE A CONVERSION

00:32:06.724 --> 00:32:07.992
THERAPY IN MY OPINION

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:10.495
COMPLETELY OUT OF OUR- WE'LL

00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:12.830
HOUSE THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:32:12.897 --> 00:32:14.599
IS WHAT WE BELIEVE AND I

00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:15.066

CALIFORNIA VALUES SO THANK YOU

DOOR ALSO FOLLOW BY STATE OR

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:25.576
MONNING. THERE'S TWO ISSUES ONE

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:28.079
IS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE

00:32:28.146 --> 00:32:32.750
PROTECT OF THE FREEDOM. OF ALL

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:35.420
CALIFORNIANS. TO BE TREATED

00:32:35.486 --> 00:32:36.688
WITH THE RESPECT AND NOT TO

00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:38.956
FEEL THAT THEY ARE ISOLATED

00:32:39.023 --> 00:32:41.159
THAT THEY ARE IN DANGER.

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:43.261
PARTICULARLY ARE MINORS I THINK

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:44.829
THERE'S A LOT OF PROTECTIONS

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:47.098
THAT WE HAVE TO AS GOVERNMENT

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:50.201
TO GET INVOLVED WITH. SO THAT'S

00:32:50.268 --> 00:32:53.071
ONE ARE TO BE TREATED WITH THE

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:55.239
RESPECT AND THE DIGNITY OF ALL

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:56.541
EIGHT EACH INDIVIDUAL HUMAN

00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:57.809
BEING. THERE'S ALSO A SECOND

00:32:57.875 --> 00:32:59.844
WHICH IS PUBLIC SAFETY AND THAT

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:02.113
IS ALSO VERY MUCH WITHIN THE

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.948
SCOPE OF GOVERNMENT SO I GUESS

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:07.018
I'D LIKE TO ASK. BECAUSE I TO

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.453
LIKE OTHERS DON'T KNOW THE

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:11.289
DETAILS BUT IF THERE'S A SHORT

00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:14.659
ANSWER TO. THE PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:16.961
ASPECT A WHICH IS AGAIN VERY

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:18.262
MUCH WITHIN THE SCOPE OF

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:22.667
GOVERNMENT IF ANY ONE OF THE

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:23.201
PROPONENTS COULD. NOT TALK

00:33:23.267 --> 00:33:27.472
ABOUT THAT. I MEAN I THINK ONE

00:33:27.538 --> 00:33:31.743
OF THE RATIONALES FOR THE BILL

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:32.877
THAT WAS BROUGHT IN TWO

00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:35.213
THOUSAND TWELVE AS WELL AS

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.080
WHAT'S BEHIND THE RESOLUTION IS

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:38.516
THE FACT THAT THESE. PRACTICES

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:40.651
HAVE BEEN FOUND BY ALL OF THE

00:33:40.718 --> 00:33:42.153
MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS AS BEING

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.322
HARMFUL TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:46.424
ENGAGED IN THEM THAT IT RESULTS

00:33:46.491 --> 00:33:48.726
IN PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM HIGH

00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:51.529
RATES OF DEPRESSION AND THOSE

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:53.498
ARE THINGS THAT THE MEDICAL AND

00:33:53.564 --> 00:33:54.699
PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERTS HAVE

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:57.468
FOUND. YOU KNOW THIS RESOLUTION

00:33:57.535 --> 00:34:01.539
IS ONE THAT I THINK CALLS ON.

00:34:01.606 --> 00:34:04.409
EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA TO THINK

00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:05.376
ABOUT THE WAY THEY ARE

00:34:05.443 --> 00:34:08.379
CONDUCTING THEIR ACTIVITIES AND

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:10.047
HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND LEARN

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:12.917
ABOUT PRACTICES THAT BABY

00:34:12.984 --> 00:34:15.019
CONVERSION THERAPY OR MAY BE

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:16.654
LIKE A CONVERSION THERAPY AND

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.322
THINK ABOUT THE HARM THAT IT

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.857
HAS AS THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES

00:34:19.924 --> 00:34:22.727
IT IS A RESOLUTION. AND I THINK

00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:26.264
THE ORIGINAL BILL AND ACTION

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:27.832
RELATED TO CONVERSION THERAPY

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:28.933
IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.468
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THESE HAVE

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:31.135
FOUND HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE

00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:32.870
HELPFUL I HAVE THE TWO OF THEM

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:33.871
FOUND TO BE HARMFUL AND

00:34:33.938 --> 00:34:36.107
GOVERNMENT HAS. A ROLE IN

00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:38.509
PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM HARM

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:41.712
JUST AS IT DOES IT CONSUMER

00:34:41.779 --> 00:34:42.313

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:46.964
I CAN CREDIT HIM MORE THAN

00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:49.734
ANYBODY I KNOW OF IN CALIFORNIA

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.502
FOR BREAKING DOWN THE WALL OF

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:53.237
TENSION BETWEEN THE LGBT

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:55.806
COMMUNITY AND THE CHURCH. AND

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:57.074
PEOPLE OF FAITH AS I KNOW HE

00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:59.377
HAS BUILT VERY POSITIVE

00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:02.046
RELATIONSHIPS WITH A MANY

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:03.214
PASTORS THAT I KNOW PERSONALLY

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.982

00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:06.450
THINK HE'S DEMONSTRATED THE

00:38:06.517 --> 00:38:09.320
LOVE AND COMPASSION THAT THAT

00:38:09.387 --> 00:38:11.789
HE'S EXPRESSING HERE IN HIS ACR

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:12.590

SAFETY SO I THINK IT'S

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:20.731
APPROPRIATE TO GIVE THE PART OF

00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:22.266

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:23.534

PRACTICES IF YOU IS TO BRING

00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:05.643
COURT I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THE

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.078
SCIENCE BUT I HAVE REVIEWED

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:09.080
SOME OF THE SCIENCE AND READ

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:13.217
ARTICLES ABOUT IT. AND. IT'S

00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:14.985
FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR TO BLAME

00:39:15.052 --> 00:39:18.622
THE FAITH COMMUNITY. FOR THE

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:20.825
POOR MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AND

00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:22.793
ALL THE STIGMA AND PROBLEMS

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.395
RELATE IN SUICIDE RATES RELATED

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:28.299
TO LGBT ISSUES THERE'S A LOT OF

00:39:28.365 --> 00:39:29.166
OTHER ISSUES GOING ON THERE

00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:32.470
BESIDES FAITH PEOPLE'S STIGMA

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:39.076
OR OR PERCEIVED STIGMA. HOWEVER

00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:41.145
IN MY AREA OF EXPERTISE THOUGH

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:43.948
IT IT IS THE PICK UP CASE WHICH

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:45.015
WAS REFERRED TO EARLIER I'D

00:39:45.082 --> 00:39:46.884
LIKE TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS. AND

00:39:46.951 --> 00:39:49.186
THAT THE PICK UP CASE WAS THE

00:39:49.253 --> 00:39:49.787
CASE WITH THAT WENT TO THE

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:52.056
NINTH CIRCUIT ABOUT THE MINOR.

00:39:52.123 --> 00:39:54.091
THE MINOR CONVERSION THERAPY

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:54.725
BAD IT WAS UP HELD AT THE NINTH

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:57.261
CIRCUIT. AND IF THE ROOF THE

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:58.496
ONLY REASON IT WAS UP HELD AT

00:39:58.562 --> 00:40:00.097
THE NINTH CIRCUIT IS BECAUSE OF

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:01.332
THIS PROFESSIONAL SPEECH

00:40:01.398 --> 00:40:03.467
EXCEPTION. AND IN THE COURTS

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:04.735
AND WILL NORMALLY WE WOULD

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:06.137
ALLOW YOU TO REGULATE THE

00:40:06.203 --> 00:40:08.439
SPEECH HERE OF PSYCHOLOGISTS OR

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:09.507
PSYCHIATRISTS COUNSELLING

00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:12.543
MINOR. BUT WE WERE GONNA

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:12.977
RECOGNIZE THIS NOVEL

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:14.945
PROFESSIONAL SPEECH EXCEPTION.

THE PROBLEM WITH. RELYING ON

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:18.282
THE PICK UP CASE WHICH THE

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:20.484
LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS DID. THAT

00:40:20.551 --> 00:40:21.652
I READ LATE LAST NIGHT FOR

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:24.021
TODAY. IS THAT THE PICKUP CASE

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:26.524
HAS PENNED OVER RULED BY THE

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.459
CASE I CITED EARLIER WHICH

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.094
ISN'T A FLOOD VERSUS THE SERRA.

00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:31.462
ON THE BIGGER CASE WASN'T

00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:33.397
SPECIFICALLY OVERRULED BUT THE

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:34.598
WHOLE REASON FOR WHICH WHICH

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:35.599
WAS A PROFESSIONAL SPEECH

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:36.667
EXCEPTION TO THE FIRST

00:40:36.734 --> 00:40:39.637
AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS. WAS OVER

00:40:39.703 --> 00:40:42.773

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.542
HERE TODAY IS I'VE HEARD VERY

00:40:44.608 --> 00:40:45.776
LITTLE CONCERNED EXCEPT FROM A

THREATS TO PUBLIC SAFETY TO

00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:04.895
KIND OF DO AWAY WITH THE FIRST

OF OUR FREEDOMS GO OUT THE

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:07.765
DOOR. AND SO WE'VE GOT TO BE

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:09.800
VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE USE PUBLIC

00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:13.170

FROM A PLACE OF LOVE WHICH I

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:38.482
BELIEVE IS WHAT THE CHURCH

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:41.285
ESPOUSES. IT DOESN'T MANDATE

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:43.787
THAT YOU DO ANY PARTICULAR

00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:45.689

WAS SO ELOQUENTLY CALLED OUT

00:45:53.283 --> 00:45:55.586
THAT WOULD PROHIBIT MY ABILITY

00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:57.020
AS A PASTOR MY COLLEAGUES

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:59.056

SPEAK ON THIS JUST FOR CONTEXT

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:32.783
BECAUSE IT TEARS THAT NUMBER OF

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:34.851
COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESS ONE

00:47:34.918 --> 00:47:35.686

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FORTY

00:47:37.387 --> 00:47:38.655
THREE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:47:38.722 --> 00:47:40.157
TWELVE THE STATE MADE A STRONG

00:47:40.224 --> 00:47:41.992
STATEMENT THAT WE SAID YES

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:43.460
THERE'S A HARMFUL PRACTICE OF

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:44.461
CONVERSION THEIR FREE FOR

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:46.096
MINORS EIGHTEEN AND UNDER THAT

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:47.097
IS THE LAW OF THE LAND THAT HAS

00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:48.999
BEEN UP HEALTH. MULTIPLE TIMES

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.634
SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHICH

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:52.002
BY THE WAY FIFTEEN OTHER STATES

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:53.503
HAVE ALSO SINCE TWO THOUSAND

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.705
AND TWELVE ALSO PASSED SIMILAR

00:47:54.771 --> 00:47:56.273
TYPES OF LEGISLATION

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.809
RECOGNIZING THE SIGNS. OF ALL

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:01.144
OF THESE OTHER SO STATIONS.

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:01.745
LAST YEAR THEN WE SAID WELL WE

00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:02.913
WANT TO PROTECT ALL PEOPLE NOT

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.381
JUST MINORS AND THAT'S WHY WE

00:48:04.448 --> 00:48:06.416
NEARLY. FOCUSING TAILORED

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:08.218
ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FORTY

00:48:08.285 --> 00:48:10.120
THREE LAST YEAR. ON CONVERSION

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:11.288
THERAPY AS A FRAUDULENT

00:48:11.355 --> 00:48:12.489
PRACTICE WHICH IS THAT IF

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:13.223
THERE'S A FINANCIAL

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:14.625
TRANSACTION. THAT WOULD BE

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:15.692
CONSIDERED A FRAUDULENT

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:17.527
PRACTICE BUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:18.462
WHO HAVE TESTIFIED HERE TODAY

00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:20.130
IN OPPOSITION WOULD STILL BE A

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:21.832
LATE ABLE. TO PRACTICE THE

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:23.600
CONVERSION THERAPY SHOULD THEY-

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:25.535
SHOULD THEY WISH TO DO SO. SO

00:48:25.602 --> 00:48:26.703
LONG AS AN THERE'S NOT THAT

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.572
FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. THAT

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:30.340
PIECE OF LEGISLATION PASSED

00:48:30.407 --> 00:48:31.608
BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:32.676
SENATE. BUT IN THOSE

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:34.711
CONVERSATIONS WE ALSO HAD AN

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:36.113
OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH.

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:37.547
EVANGELICAL LEADERS BECAUSE I

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:39.549
THOUGHT IS VERY IMPORTANT. TO

00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:41.285
ENCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF. A

00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:43.086
STRONGER APPROACH IN

00:48:43.153 --> 00:48:45.856
INCORPORATING MADE A DIFFERENT

00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:47.791

PAUSED IN I HELD THAT BILL. IT

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:57.200
WAS READY TO GO TO THE

THIS TOGETHER I THINK WE CAN BE

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:09.613
TRANSFORMATIVE IN THIS

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.048
CONVERSATION BECAUSE AS A

00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:13.950

NINE FORTY THREE OF A

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:15.452
FRAUDULENT PRACTICE CONVERSION

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:17.020
THERAPY AS A FRONT IN PRACTICE.

00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:19.022

WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH YOU

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.092
BUT WE THINK THIS GOES JUST A

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:23.560
LITTLE BIT TOO FAR TO COULD WE

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:25.462
WORK TOGETHER WITH YOU AND

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:27.998

HEARD FROM TESTIMONY IS

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:37.074
ACTUALLY CONTRARY TO THAT IN

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.443
FACT THIS WAS DONE IN

00:49:39.509 --> 00:49:40.911
COLLABORATION WITH FAITH

00:49:40.977 --> 00:49:42.079

MEET WITH EVANGELICAL LEADERS

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:49.019
TO GET THEIR SUPPORT ON THIS

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:50.387
PIECE OF RESOLUTION INCLUDE

00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:51.688
INCLUDING KEVIN MANILA THE

FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE

EVANGELICALS SO AGAIN WOULD YOU

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.128
HAVE BEFORE YOU HERE. IS THE

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:00.697
WORK OF A COLLABORATIVE

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:02.833
APPROACH WITH MEMBERS OF THE

00:50:02.899 --> 00:50:04.267
FAITH COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE

00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:06.703
ENTIRE STATE TO SAY WE STAND IN

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.405
SOLIDARITY WITH YOU AND

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:09.606
HOPEFULLY WE CAN BUILD OFF OF

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:10.974
THIS WORKING RELATIONSHIP TO

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:12.342
IDENTIFY HOW WE CAN WORK

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:14.344
TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY MOVING

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:16.146
FORWARD FROM A PLACE OF LOVE

00:50:16.213 --> 00:50:18.081
COMPASSION AND RECOGNIZING ALL

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:19.383
PEOPLE LET ME JUST FINALLY JUST

00:50:19.449 --> 00:50:22.152
SAY THAT THAT. THIS IS A NON

00:50:22.219 --> 00:50:25.322
BINDING RESOLUTION. THIS IS A

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:26.056
NON BINDING RESOLUTION. SO THE

00:50:26.123 --> 00:50:28.658
OPPOSITION WAS OPPOSE LAST TIME.

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:30.360
IN WHICH THEY WERE NOT

00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:32.095
NECESSARILY AT THE TABLE AND IT

00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:33.630
WAS NEARLY SCOPE TO FINANCIAL

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:35.198
TRANSACTION UNDER THE CONSUMER

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:35.799
LEGAL REMEDIES ACT VERY NARROW

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:38.635
IN SCOPE. AND YET EVEN WITH

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:40.303
EVANGELICAL LEADERS THEY'RE

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.605
STILL OPPOSED SOME SOME ARE

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:44.007
STILL OPPOSE. SO IT'S JUST VERY

00:50:44.074 --> 00:50:45.575
CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE WILL BE

00:50:45.642 --> 00:50:46.977
A CONVERSATION OF A DIFFERENCE

00:50:47.043 --> 00:50:48.211
OF THIS I'M SURE THE OPPOSITION

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:49.379
WOULD STILL BE OPPOSED AMERICA

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:51.481
QUALITY OR MY OPPORTUNITY TO

00:50:51.548 --> 00:50:53.316
ADOPT OR TO DONATE BLOOD TO BE

00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:54.684
PART OF THE BOY SCOUTS ARE TO

00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:55.986
SERVE A MILITARY. WE'VE ALREADY

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:57.954
SETTLED THIS. BUT AGAIN WHAT

00:50:58.021 --> 00:51:00.223
YOU SEE HERE BEFORE YOU IS A

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:02.459
COLLABORATION OF THE WORK THAT

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:03.794
I THINK I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.329
CAN BE. WE CAN STAND ON THIS IN

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:07.631
A TRANSFORMATIVE WAY TO SAY

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:08.899
THAT WE STAND TOGETHER AND

00:51:08.965 --> 00:51:10.667
UNITED IN THESE EFFORTS AND

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:12.369
BUILD OFF OF THIS AS WELL BUT

00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:14.371
AGAIN THIS NOTION OF CONVERSION

00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:16.006
THERAPY IS THE ANTI FEDERAL TO

THIS IS THIS IS A PROCESS.

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.663
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:55.598
OF VETTING THAT GOES INTO THIS

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:57.433
PROCESS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.403
IT IS ONE THAT IS AGREED UPON

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:01.404

TIMES OF NEED. THANK YOU. THANK

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:17.153
YOU WHAT QUESTIONS OTHER

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:17.753
QUESTIONS CENTER DRAWS SO DID

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:21.090
YOU HAVE A QUESTION. YOU WANT

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:25.328
TO MOVE THE BILL AS AMENDED.

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:27.296
YES ALRIGHT THE- BUT I JUST

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:30.466
WANNA SAY COUPLE OF THINGS I

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:31.500
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:34.870
PARTICULAR. THE DIFFERENCES

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:37.940
BETWEEN ASYLUM AND IN REFUGEE

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:39.942
UP BUT IT SEEMS TO ME WHAT WE

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.877
SEEM TO KEEP CONTINUES TO GO

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:43.713
THROUGH GENERATION PAST

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:45.615
GENERATION IS TO FORGET THE

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:48.284
PREVIOUS GENERATIONS GROUP. OF

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:52.455
REFUGEES. AND IT DEPENDS ON

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:55.324
WHERE THEY COME FROM.

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:56.926
CRITICALLY THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:59.395
OUR GOVERNMENT USES TO DECIDE

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:00.396
IF THEY'RE GONNA EXCEPT THE

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.431
MORE OR NOT ACCEPT THEM SO

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:04.867
THERE WAS A DIFFERENT POLICY

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:08.337
USE WITH CUBANS AND WITH

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:10.640
VIETNAMESE AND WITH OTHER

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:12.975
COUNTRIES OF FROM. GET OUT

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:14.810
THEY'RE JUST DIFFERENT WAYS

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:16.512
THAT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.948
DECIDED TO ACCEPT REFUGEES ARE

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:20.283
NOT ACCEPT REFUGEES CENTRAL

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:22.285
AMERICANS FELL THE DORIANS

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:24.854
BECAUSE OF THE WAR. SO YOU KNOW

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.189
MY CONCERN IS THAT AND THE

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:28.791
REASON I'M SUPPORTING THIS IS

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:31.093
BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE A

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.130
SYSTEM. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:36.399
CAN TAKE TWENTY ONE MILLION OF

01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:38.000
PEOPLE BUT WE CERTAINLY SHOULD

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:40.603
HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS BASED ON

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.672
THE NEED IN THAT COUNTRY AND

01:05:42.738 --> 01:05:44.440
THERE'S REAL HUMANITARIAN

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:46.242
CRISIS IT'S TAKING PLACE IN

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:47.877
THESE COUNTRIES AND WE SHOULD

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:50.780
NOT FORGET THE PAST GENERATIONS

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:53.115
THE HUNGARIANS THE- JEWISH THE

01:05:53.182 --> 01:05:55.484
IRISH THERE WERE ALL THESE.

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:56.752
TIMES THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:59.955
THAT HAVE THEIR GROUPS AND WE

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:00.790
JUST SEEM TO GO THROUGH THE

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:02.158
SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:04.527
WITH THE CURRENT REFUGEE SO.

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:06.696
YOU KNOW I SUPPORT THIS BUT

SO THIRTY THOUSAND IS WHAT THE

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:04.453
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.087

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:07.723
LIVING UP TO. SEVENTY FIVE

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:08.290
THOUSAND IS A SUBSTANTIALLY

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:09.892
HIGHER NUMBER THAN CLOSER TO

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:11.594
THE HISTORIC NORMS AND NOW

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:14.663
WE'RE NOT SAYING SEVENTY FIVE

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:15.264
THOUSAND FOR SO FOR CALIFORNIA

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:15.898
RESIDENTS AND FIVE THOUSAND THE

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:19.235
NATIONAL. ALL RIGHT OF

ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:24.573
I TO SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT WE

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.776
ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS THE

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:27.710
FACT THAT WE ARE VILIFYING

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:30.212
IMMIGRANTS TODAY IS UNSETTLING

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.447
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:33.215
FROM TROUBLED NATIONS ELSEWHERE

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:33.716
AROUND THE WORLD THEY'RE

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:37.019
DESPERATE. WE KNOW THAT MOST

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:37.620
PEOPLE DON'T LEAVE HOME TO GO

01:07:37.686 --> 01:07:40.523
SOMEWHERE ELSE. JUST FOR THE

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:42.591
HECK OF IT THEY COME BECAUSE

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:44.193
THEY ARE IN FEAR OF THEIR LIVES

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.594
OR THEY BELIEVE THAT THE OF

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:47.596
PROMISE OF GREATER OPPORTUNITY

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:48.864
IT'S TRAUMATIC TO LEAVE WHAT

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:50.399
YOU'RE NOT WHICH TRAUMATIC I

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:52.034
SUSPECT TO LEAVE A COUNTRY

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:53.068
WHERE YOU KNOW THE LANGUAGE TO

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:56.872
A COUNTRY WHERE YOU DON'T. SO I

01:07:56.939 --> 01:07:57.873
THINK THAT WE HAVE TO STOP

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.575
VILIFYING PEOPLE AND TAKE A

01:07:59.642 --> 01:08:01.277
LOOK AT THOSE WHO ARE REALLY

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:03.245
COMING HERE OF FOR THEIR SAFETY

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:05.614
AND SECURITY IN BECAUSE- AS WE

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:06.749
SEE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:08.784
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH FAMINE OR

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:12.688
DROUGHT OR- IDEOLOGICAL REASONS

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.757
OR OR THE KIND OF PROGRAMS THAT

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:17.059
BROUGHT MY GRANDPARENTS FROM.

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:18.527
EASTERN EUROPE WHERE THE

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:21.163
COUNTRY DID A TO SOME EXTENT

01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:22.598
OPEN ITS BORDERS THAT TO SOME

01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:24.667
EXTENT IT DIDN'T BUT CERTAINLY

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:27.603
A POLICY HUMAN A HUMANISTIC

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:29.605

01:08:42.384 --> 01:08:43.752
