LOVELY AND BOOKED SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE SOME GOING FOR TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE DOLLARS SO OUR CONCERN IS ESSENTIALLY THAT DISAGREEMENTS AND THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY- REQUIREMENT OR PROTECTIONS FOR TAXPAYERS OR FOR WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED BY OTHER JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS LOS ANGELES OR LONG BEACH THOSE JURISDICTIONS. FOR THEIR HOSPITALITY CONTRACTS HAVE REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTOR THEY HAVE LIVING WAGE REQUIREMENTS THEY HAVE- WORKER RETENTION AND SO THIS IS A WONDERFUL PROJECT THAT HAS THE GOAL OF PROVIDING LOW COST ACCOMMODATION SO ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE COAST WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS HAVE THE SAME ACCESS AND ARE ABLE TO STAY AT THESE COTTAGES AND LIVE IN THE AREA WHERE THEY WORK- SO WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD- AND HOPEFULLY WILL I DO BELIEVE WILL BE MEETING TODAY AS WELL- BUT JUST WANTED TO RAISE THOSE FOR THE COMMITTEE.

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE NO ONE TO THE THANK YOU ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. YES KAMALA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THE FOR THE AUTHORED THE QUESTION BEGS AN ANSWER THERE WHY THE TERM A FIFTY FIVE YEARS WHEN THE FEDERAL- ACTION UP FOR THE- CONCESSIONNAIRE NORMALLY WOULD BE A LITTLE LESS EFFECTIVE THE AROUND HIRTY NINE YEARS SO WHY THE EXTRA. LENGTH OF TIME SO I'M UNDER EXISTING EXISTING LAWS STATE PARKS TODAY HAS THE AUTHORITY WITH AT THIS PROJECTS OR IN ANY OTHER PARK TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT OF A FIFTY YEAR PERIOD. I WITH A CONCESSIONAIRE THAT'S MAKING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS I'M IN THAT THE LOGIC FOR THAT IS TO ENABLE CONCESSIONAIRE TO RECOUP THOSE THOSE INVESTMENTS SO THAT IS EXISTING THIS FIVE WOULD EXTEND EXISTING LAWN BY FIVE YEARS. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR AT THE MAXIMUM QUALIFYING FEDERAL TAX CREDIT SO OUR GOAL HERE REALLY IS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT LEAVING ANY FEDERAL DOLLARS ON THE TABLE- TO MOVE THIS PROJECT FORWARD THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE. JUST GOOD CLARIFICATION BECAUSE OF A PERSONALLY BEEN TO CRYSTAL COVE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL SPOT. BUT YOU'RE ASKING FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS TO CURRENTLY HAVE THIRTY SECURE SO WE'RE ONLY EXTENDED IT ACTUALLY NINETEEN YEARS TO DO THE MATH TO GET INTO THE FIFTY FIVE YEAR THRESHOLD. THANK YOU YES. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THAT CLARIFICATION CORRECT THANK. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AM I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR AUTHOR SO. I'M AS POINTED OUT BY OUR COLLEAGUES THIS MERELY EXTENDS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY CAN. EXTEND THE CONCESSION CONTRACT BUT I ASSUME IT WILL GO THROUGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS IS TO EXTEND A CONTRACT IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I ASSUME IT WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THE PUBLIC PROCESS WITH WHICH- INDIVIDUALS COULD ENGAGE AS IT USUALLY WITH THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THAT. CORRECT YES SO AS I SAID WITH EXISTING LAWS STATE PARK'S DOES HAVE EXISTING AUTHORITY TO. ENTER INTO A CONTRACT OF THE PERIOD OF UP TO FIFTY YEARS. I IN ORDER TO FOR A CONCESSIONAIRE THAT'S MAKING A CAPITAL INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO RECOUP THOSE COSTS AND CERTAINLY WILL. IT HERE TOO AT THE REQUIREMENTS- THAT ARE ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN STATE LAW. AS PART OF THIS AND- YEAH I WOULD NOTE AS SAID THAT THEY- THAT I GUESS TWEENER COMMENT TIME NOTED. THEIR CONCERNS WERE BY RAISED BY YESTERDAY. AND AB REALLY HAPPY TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION AND WORK WITH OUR OUR TWITTER YOU KNOW POTENTIAL OPPOSITION. I TO ENSURE THAT SAID THAT THIS IS A PROJECT THAT'S GOING TO HAVE. TREMENDOUS BENEFITS FOR THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND REALLY FOR ALL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU I THINK IT'S A IT SEEMS LIKE A SMALL CHANGE TO MAKE TO ADD INCREDIBLE BENEFIT. A CO AND LIKE THE- ACTUALLY. OUT MAKE SURE THAT I CALIFORNIA HAVE FOR LACK.

THIS RELATES TO. IMPROVING ENCOURAGING FRANKLY ACCESS INTO OUR STATE PARKS ON EACH ADMISSIONS DAY IN CALIFORNIA SEPTEMBER NIGHT. THIS ACTUALLY COMES OUT OF MY PERSONAL LIFE EXPERIENCE IN SENSE OF B. WHILE I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL RANCHO CORDOVA EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS. I WOULD WORK WITH ONE OF MY MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND WE WILL TAKE A GROUP OF MIDDLE SCHOOLERS. DOWN TO CAMP IN NEW BRIGHTON STATE BEACH. AND I WOULD JUST FOR THE WRANGLER I RUN THE CAMPSITE. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE AT FOUR DAYS WITH A GROUP OF A HUNDRED. I WOULD RUN THE FOOD OPERATION FEED EVERYBODY WHILE THE TEACHER TO THE MATH SCIENCE CAMP. AND BECAME VERY EVIDENT TO ME AS A COUNSELOR RANCHO CORDOVA. LOOK AT THAT FOR NIGHT THAT ARRIVED. WE HAD LOTS OF KIDS. FROM RANCHO CORDOVA CALIFORNIA DOWN THE OCEAN WHO HAD NEVER CAMPED. AND IN MANY CASES NEVER EVEN SEEN THE OCEAN BEFORE. SO JUST REALLY AN EYE OPENER FOR ME TO TAKE KIDS R. RANCHO CORDOVA OVER THE COAST AND THE COURTESY THE WONDER AND AMAZEMENT OF THAT EXPERIENCE. SO THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT A 50% DISCOUNT UPON ENTRY TO ANY CALIFORNIA STATE PARK ON SEPTEMBER NINTH EVERY YEAR WHICH IS OUR MISSION STATE. TO JUST TRYING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET OUT EXPLORE ALL OF OUR PARKS WITH THE BOLSA CHICA. OF PROVIDENCE MOUNTAIN. GRINDED ROCKS THERE IN AMADOR COUNTY CALAVERAS BIG TREES TO JUST GET PEOPLE OUT AND ENGAGE WITH TE WORLD AROUND US- OBVIOUSLY OUR STATE PARK SYSTEM WHICH IS HIGHLY DIVERSE HAS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED UNITS. CONTAIN SOME OF THE FINEST MOST DIVERSE NATURAL CULTURAL. AND RECREATION RESOURCE IN THE NATION WHICH JUST AFFECTS THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND ALL THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT MAKE UP OUR LANDSCAPE- AND- BUT NOT EVERYONE. HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT THEY MAY NOT. IT AFFORDABILITY COULD BE AN ISSUE BUT IT'S ALSO FRANKLY JUST GIVE A MOTIVATION. PARKS ARE HERE EVERY DAY SO YEAH WE'LL GO VISIT BUT WHEN. ON SO ANYWAY I WILL IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONNECT WITH THIS HERITAGE I DEFINITELY KNOW THAT OF I JUST KNOW WHAT A- SOURCE TO WONDER IT WAS TO GET KIDS OUT IN THE OUT OF DOORS. AND DOWN THE BEACH AND WATCHING THE WAVES COME IN AND- SOLVING PROBLEMS TOGETHER WHICH IS WHAT SCIENCE CAMP AIMS TO DO BUT ACTUALLY ANY FAMILY GOING CAMPING HERE YOU'RE JUST DEALING WITH THE NEWNESS OF THAT EXPERIENCE- I DO BELIEVE I'M SUPPORT TODAY- ON THE PHONE LINE BY RACHEL NORTON.

CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION IS AN INDEPENDENT SEVENTY THOUSAND MEMBER SUPPORTED NONPROFIT THAT MOBILIZES A DIVERSE NETWORK OF CALIFORNIANS TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE OUR CALIFORNIA STATE PARK SYSTEM FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL. AND WE'RE REALLY THANKFUL TO BE HERE EVEN VIRTUALLY BECAUSE SUPPORT AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY EIGHT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS OFFER ACCESS TO WORLD CLASS NATURE WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR RECREATION THAT ME ALL CALIFORNIANS NEED. HOWEVER AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE MORE THAN A THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN POVERTY AND IN A RECENT STUDY UCLA FOUND THAT 59% OF THE STATE'S MOST ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED HOUSEHOLDS LIVE WITH A HALF MILE WALK. A TWO MILE BIKE RIDE OR A TWENTY THREE MILE DRIVE THE STATE PARK. BUT THE FULL PRICE OF ENTRY MAY POSE A BARRIER THAT KEEPS CALIFORNIANS FROM EXPERIENCING THE STATE'S CROWN JEWEL ARE MAGNIFICENT STATE PARK SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION SUPPORTS THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT REDUCES BARRIERS TO PARTS OF THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO THE POSITIVE IMPACT THAT PARKS BOB. ON OUR HEALTH OUR HAPPINESS AND OUR QUALITY OF LIFE. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND HIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND LEGISLATION THAT STATE PARKS CANS THAT LIMITATION. ON DISCOUNT DAYS TO MANAGE OVERCROWDING. DAMAGE TEN NATURAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES AND TO SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. SO AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TO FIND THE SOURCE OF RESOURCES TO OFFSET ANY LOSS OF REVENUE. FROM THE DISCOUNT DAYS OF THAT STATE PARKS CAN REMAIN WHOLE.

THANK YOU MISTER MISTER COOLEY FOR THIS BUT I JUST HAVE A QUESTION OF WHY NOT COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THE FEE FOR THIS ONE DAY YEAH. HOW DID WE LAND ON THE ABOUT. BUDGET ISSUES- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S- YEAH I THINK A HALF OFF IS A GOOD. PLACE TO BE ACTUALLY MADE PEOPLE BUDGET A LITTLE BIT I DON'T THINK IT'S- AN OVERWHELMING BURDEN. ON LONG TERM I LIKE THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF STATES THAT ACTUALLY DON'T CHARGE FOR THEIR STATE PARKS- BUT I THINK AS A TO INTRODUCED THE IDEA. TO WORK OUT THE MECHANICS OF HOW HEAVILY IMPACTED PARKS YOU MIGHT RESTRICT SOME RULES I THINK THIS GIVES US A GETS US IN THE SPACE OF SUCH AND I THINK. I THINK THE LOGIC IS COMPELLING. I BUT- I'M NOT LOOKING TO. RUN INTO BUDGET TROUBLES ON IDEA THAT I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT. I MEAN I SIT HERE THINK OF ALL THE CAMPING I'VE DONE OF COURSE AS A SCOUT MASTER. I'VE BEEN DOING CAMPING FOREVER I HAVE ACTUALLY A- WELL A WHOLE HA IT TRUNKS OF EQUIPMENT IN MY GARAGE AT HOME AND I CAN FEED A HUNDRED PEOPLE FOR FOUR DAYS PORTABLE STEAM TABLES THE WHOLE NINE YARDS AND YOU JUST THINK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE MY FUNNIEST CAMPING EXPERIENCE I REMEMBER CAMPAIGN. ONCE IN A- IN A KIND OF ISOLATED AREA WITH A BUNCH OF. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL KIDS. AND ABOUT ONE AM. THE STILL THE NIGHT WAS BROKEN BY THIS TERRIBLE TERRIFIED SCREAMING. AND COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT WAS GOING ON SO IT HELPED ME IN THE OTHER ADULTS WE PILE OUT WE GO FIND A SOURCE OF SCREAMING AND IT TURNS OUT THAT A BUNCH OF MIDDLE SCHOOLERS RED TENT. AND LITTLE WIGGLE WORMS IN THEIR SPRAWLING AS THEY WERE SLEEPING IN SLEEPING BAGS ONE SLID INTO ANOTHER. AND THE OTHER WAS CONVINCED THAT RACCOON WAS ATTACKING JUST THAT THE- THE HAIR GOT IN THERE HE SAID THERE SORT OF LIKE SO AFRAID. SO WE HAD TO SETTLE THINGS DOWN NO RACCOONS IN THE TENTS. YEAH BUT A JUSTICE IT'S A IT'S A YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW AMAZING THIS SORT OF EXPERIENCES- ANOTHER WE ALWAYS SAID WE JUST TAKE A MOONLIT HIKE DOWN OFF THE BLUFFS OF- NEW BRIGHTON STATE BEACH DOWN THE BEACH WHAT THE TEACHERS ATTENDED SEN. YOU KNOW MOONLIGHT ON THE OCEAN THE ROLE THE WAVES EVERYTHING IT'S JUST AMAZING SO I JUST THINK IT'S TO GET OUR KIDS OUT TO SEE THE BEAUTY THERE- SO I SORT OF FAVOR THAT IS A LONG TERM POLICY BUT TO GOVERN IS TO CHOOSE REDUCE FOR TO MAKE A CHOICE. I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN A IN AN OLD CHINESE PROVERB FOR HOW CHANGE HAPPENS WHICH IS TAKE FROM GEOMETRY WHICH WAS MY BATH MAT MATH POINT LINE PLANE. IN IN TO HELP JUST TALKING SPACE ADD A SECOND POINT NOW WE HAVE A LINE. THAT A THIRD POINT NOW WE HAVE A PLACE TO FIND. AND I THINK THIS IS A POINT THIS IS A POINT OF BEGINNING. A REPRESENTS THIS IDEA- IT CAN BE TAILORED TO THOSE PARKS ARE HEAVILY IMPACTED. BUT I THINK IT'S WE ARE SO INVESTED ALL THESE PARKS WHY NOT ENCOURAGE FAMILIES AND KIDS TO DISCOVER THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH URGENT I WILL. UP REGULAR REGULAR HAS A QUESTION. I THINK HE STILL HAS NOT BEEN DISCUSSED PLEASE. I I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR YOUR BILL TODAY AND SECOND TWO IS COMING FOR ME I'M GONNA. LOOK FOR YOUR ON A- I WE START WITH POINT I WAS AMENITIES CYPRESS THE JOB THAT REFERENCE ANTI TEND WE START WITH THE POINT AND BUILD FROM. THERE AND THAT'S WHERE I'VE I'VE HAD TO DO THAT MANY ATTENTION COMPROMISED AND WE ALL RUN INTO THIS BUT YOUR WEALTH ALONG THE WAY SO I APPRECIATE IT BUT AS PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS I THINK. YOUR APPROACH TO ENCOURAGE OUR YOUTH TO BE IN THAT THE SPACE IS GREAT AND HONORABLE AND I SUPPORT THAT BUT OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE HARDEST AXIS EVEN THAT HALF PRICE OFF THAT'S ONE DAY- MAKES IT HARD AND SAYS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EQUITY. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNPRECEDENTED BUDGETS- FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF THE SPUR STRINGS HAVE HOPE THAT THEY LOOK AT YOUR OF YOUR PRAGMATIC WAYS TO MAYBE. SUPPLEMENTED THAT WE GET TO THAT FREE ON A ONE DAY ONE DAY OUT OF THE YEAR- AND SO FOR SOME PART. I'M ALSO AWARE OF HOW TIGHT BUDGETS ARE FOR OUR PARKS OUT THERE BUT I HOPE AT THE STATE WE CAN GET THERE NOT JUST FOR ONE DAY BUT JUST IN GENERAL AND FIVE FIND THAT COMMON GROUND SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS HAVE TO OF DUCK. INTO WHAT. OF COURSE WAS TALK ABOUT. I I'LL AYE LIE. YOUR OF LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TO DO GET KIDS OUT. INTO INTO PARKS AND ENDED OUT INTO NATURE AND SEE SOME OF THAT. MAYBE THE MORE FOCUSED IS- HOW FAR I THINK. YOU'RE I PLAY ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH LET'S NOT HURT THE BUDGET LET'S TRY TO BALANCE IT AS IT MOVES TOWARD IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR BILL- IS TO HAVE A- YOU INSERT SOMEPLACE. WHERE THERE'S DIRECTION TO THE STATE PARKS TO KEEP TRACK OF THIS. AMP AND BRING BACK A REPORT TO THE STATE NOT SOMETIME THE UPGRADE IDEA SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL BENEFICIAL VALUE. WAS GAINED FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN THIS OPPORTUNITY YEAH. I WILL CERTAINLY DO THAT AND I WILL. I WILL PURSUE CONVERSATIONS AND PUSH THE IDEA. THAT YOU'VE RAISED- I DEFINITELY THINK THESE ARE JUST A TREMENDOUS ASSET AND WHY DO WE CAPITALIZE ON IT- YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE MADE TO BE USED ENJOYED EXPERIENCED- AND- YES WE HAVE BUDGETARY ISSUES AND THAT'S NOT DE MINIMUS. BUT SO I WILL. GOING TO ROUTE ALL WORKERS STAFF ACTUALLY COME OF SOME VERBIAGE WILL PUT AMEND SUBSEQUENTLY- AS I MOVE THE BILL ALONG BUT I WILL HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH. OUR BUDGET COLLEAGUES ON THAT I DON'T. M. THANK YOU FOR THEIR ARREST DISCUSSION I APPRECIATE MISTER DOUGLAS COMMENT I WANNA MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T COME TOO BURDENSOME I'M NOT AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ON JUST HOW HE CAN TRY YES YES YES BUT I DO I THINK IT'S INTERESTING YOU KNOW. AT THE VICE CHAIR AND I SAID BIRD ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE IS IT WE DON'T KNOW WE'VE NEVER DONE THIS RIGHT SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP TRACK- I HAVE A QUESTION AS I ALWAYS DO FROM YOU MISTER COOLEY. THE REVIEWING THIS BILL I LEARNED SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SEPTEMBER NINTH WAS THE DAY THAT CALIFORNIA BECAME A STATE SO I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE EFFORT HERE TO- TO ADD AN ELEMENT OF HISTORY AS YOU ALWAYS DO. BUT I GUESS PIGGYBACKING ON WHAT MISS GARCIA WAS FOCUSED ON WHICH IS EQUITY- I GUESS IF. EVEN I. WE ALL WANTTO ACHIEVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO OUR PARKS AND IT'S VERY MUCH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE. SEPTEMBER NINTH MOVES EVERY YEAR. AND I GUESS I WOULD BE CURIOUS WHETHER WOULD BE MORE. MORE EQUITABLE TO PROVIDE THAT ON A WEEKEND CONSISTENTLY VERSES A DAY THAT MOVES. AND THEN WOULD FALL ON DAYS WHEN PERHAPS YOU KNOW OUR WORKERS THAT ARE WORKING. YOU KNOW DURING. THE WEEK WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THIS BENEFIT CITY OF THOUGHT FROM. YEAH I THINK. I'M OF. I'M ALL FOR ACCESS SO I ACTUALLY DO RECOGNIZE AT SEPTEMBER NINTH IS JUST A DAY THAT LEAVES OUT BECAUSE OF ITS SIGNIFICANCE IN THE STATE- BUT I DO I WONDERED ABOUT THAT MYSELF- IT ACTUALLY MAY ALSO BE AT THE START OF THE SCHOOL YEAR MIGHT BE AT A TIME IN THE SUMMER COULD BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS SO- IT'S MORE IT'S SORT OF A HOOK TO HANG THE IDEAL I'M SURE I'M OPEN ON THAT TOO YEAH YOU KNOW THE KEEPING THE ENDED VIEW EQUITY AND A USEFUL TIME- YEAH I COULD SEE ACTUALLY IT IF IT WAS THE SAME WEEKEND EVERY YEAR THAT WOULD. THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAT WOULD GET TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE REMEMBER. YOU KNOW MAYBE THE FIRST SATURDAY IN A GIVEN MONTH. YEAH SO I'VE GOT YOU KNOW I AM MY RECOMMENDATION TODAY WILL BE AND I AM HAPPY TO. FOR IT BUT I THINK THAT WE HAVE SOME WORK THAT WE CAN DO ON THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE MOST ACCESS TO THE MOST CALIFORNIANS AND I KNOW YOU WILL DO WORK DILIGENTLY- AND AGAIN EVEN IF IT'S JUST A POINT WE WORK TOWARDS THAT. PRESERVER EXXON IDEAS I THINK YOU ALL COLLEAGUES YEAH MISTER BENNETT DID YOU HAVE. AT AS- AS WE- ARE CONSIDERING MOVING TO A THREE DAY WEEKEND. ONE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS KNOWS ABOUT- I JUST WANNA GET ONE OTHER POINT OUT THAT THE NUMBER OF STATE PARKS AND- OUR STATE PARKS ARE RIGHT AT THE BEACH. HEAVILY USED. LOTS OF PEOPLE WANT TO ATTEND THOSE PARKS I'M COMPLETELY SUPPORTIVE OF- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS COMMENTS ABOUT. LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND WHY GOING FROM 50% TO. LOWER THAN THAT AND YOU'RE ALSO TALKING IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FREE. AND IT'S A THREE DAY WEEKEND. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE BASE WHERE WE HAVE PEOPLE WITH HUGE. YOU KNOW. SIX FIGURE TRAILER HOMES. AND THEY'RE ALL VYING TO BE CAMPING AT THE BEACH. AND OF. THOSE PEOPLE WERE JUST VIEW THIS AS A GREAT- IT'S THIS IS NOT AN EQUITY ISSUE FOR. FOR THESE PEOPLE I MEAN THIS IS. YOU KNOW THE COMMISSIONERS SO I JUST WANT TO I DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION TO ALL OF THAT- BUT THINK OF FOUGHT. I THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT THIS COULD BE OVER. A REAL REVENUE ISSUE AUTHORIZED. ON A THREE DAY WEEKEND IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT. FREE FOR. A THAT I'D BE WILLING MAKE IT FREE FOR LOW INCOME KIDS COME FROM SCHOOLS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. ALL THE TIME. IF WE TO COULD WITH S. LIKE IT'S KIDS OUT WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT FOR THEM EXCEPT- BUT BE CAREFUL ABOUT SUBSIDIZING JUST TO. YOU KNOW THAT THE POST THE COASTAL BEACH PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED A SUBSIDY. AND THEY GO HEY YEAH I CAN JUST SEE ME WE ALREADY HAVE BATTLES OVER YOU KNOW SIR TO GET GETTING THAT CAMPSITE TO THAT. THAT CREATES A REVENUE ISSUE BECAUSE ALL THAT HEAVY DEMAND ON THE PARK. IS EXPENSIVE SO JUST WANT TO GET THAT OUT THERE FOR YOU GUYS TO. WITH YOUR STAGE THOUGHTS ON THIS BILL WILL KEEP THAT IN MIND THANKS. FOR THANK YOU MISTER AND MISTER. THANK YOU I'M- THIS. DAY FEEL LIKE AND THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE ACCESS TO OUR PARKS JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE AFFORDABLE. I DON'T SEE THAT ANALYSIS TO ABOUT HOW THAT ACTUALLY INDUCES ADDITIONAL PARTICIPATION- AND WHAT THAT MIGHT DO AS FAR AS THE EXPENDITURES FOR- HEIGHTENED ATTENDANCE AT PARKS- THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT BUT I THINK I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A VALUE ADD. ON THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT OTHERWISE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW LOOK AT THAT TWENTY DOLLAR MISSION FEE OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE PER PERSON. THAT WOULD BE PROHIBITIVE- THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE THAT THEY GIVE ACCESS AND LIKE HER CHAIR I REALLY COMMEND YOU FOR REALLY TOUGH TYING THAT INTO A MISSION DAY. I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND PARTICULARLY FROM THE PARENTS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN AS WELL DO YOU DO- LOOK AT AT SOME WAY TO TRY TO GET THAT THE OPTION FOR PARKS SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT. SECOND SATURDAY OR SUNDAY WITH IN SEPTEMBER YOU'RE AFTER LABOR DAY WEEKEND SO THAT'S GOOD- BUT YOU ARE ALSO YOU KNOW MAY NOT BE. ON THAT WEDNESDAY. ABLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ON TO THAT IS ON THE- THE TIME THAT WE ARE- RECOGNIZING CALIFORNIA ADMISSION DAY SO- I'M SURE THE BILL CAN ENJOY SOME OF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS BUT I FEEL CONFIDENT THIS WILL BE OF VALUE ADD- YOU KNOW IN THE- DESPITE. YOU KNOW- SOME OF THE BUDGET THINGS THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW WORK ON OVERTIME. THANK YOU MISTER WARD. THREE WILL THE BILL AS PRESENTED SECOND. CAT MOTION A SECOND- AND I WANT TO THANK YOU MR COOLEY AS THE MOTHER OF A FOURTH GRADER WHO PROBABLY HAS TAKEN AFTER MOUNT DIABLO STATE PARK ON HER FOURTH GRADE PARK PASS.

I JUST WANT ONE WANNA COMMAND OUR COLLEAGUES LEADERSHIP ON THE THIRTY BY THIRTY INITIATIVE AND THE ADMINISTRATION- AS WELL AND YOURSELF FOR BRINGING ATTENTION TO THE PART OF THE WORK OF MAKING SURE WE HAVE DETAILS BEHIND THIS IS THAT WE CREATE A PROGRAM THAT MEETS ITS GOALS AND WE TO SCHOOLS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA THAT TO SOME CALIFORNIANS I'M INTERESTED TO HEAR THOUGH TO THIS PRESENTATION A FEW THAT PEACH REPRESENTATIONS. ABOUT HOW WE INSURE THIS IS HAPPENING BOTH IN REAL COMMUNITIES AND URBAN COMMUNITIES TO LIKE THE ONE I REPRESENT I HAVE A VERY DENSE DISTRICT- AND THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE BUT AS WE'RE DOING THIS THIRTY BY THIRTY CALL I HOPE THAT WERE OPEN TO GETTING CREATIVE WHETHER IT'S THROUGH BROWNFIELD WHETHER IT'S THROUGH MAY. OF OPEN SPACE WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE REALITIES THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT LEFT AND SO IF WE'RE GONNA PARTAKEN IN THIS WORK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE OPEN TO- DEFENDED COMING TOGETHER AND IN THE SAME SPACE AND SO INTERESTED TO HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE PUTTING A BIGGER SPOTLIGHT ON THIS. THANK YOU MISS GARCIA ONE OF. WHEN I CALL YOUR COMMENTS YOU MISTER KALRA FOR KEEPING THIS OF MIND THE LARGEST AND THINK ONE OF THE CRITICAL REASONS TO DO THIS IS TO BRING THE VOICES THAT EACH OF US REPRESENT EVERY.

AT NORRIS DEPUTY FOR BIODIVERSITY AND AT THE CAL NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. THANK JENNIFER IS GOING TO BE ON THE WEBEX LET'S SEE. GOOD MORNING FROM FOCUSING. YES I AM. I SHOULD BE ON THE WEBEX- YOU ARE OKAY WE DON'T SEE YOU MISTER SENATE NOW. OF IF THAT WAS PROBABLY OUR TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. PEOPLE WANT WE CAN GET SECOND WITH YOUR I DO HAVE THE POWER SO I OKAY GIVE A ONE THEY'RE TRYING TO THERE YOU ARE WE SEE A- ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING- SEE IF THE SCREEN.

I THINK I'M GOOD NOW OKAY ANYWAY I'M HERE TO TALK TODAY ABOUT THIRTY BY THIRTY VERY EXCITED ABOUT READING IF YOU'RE NOT JUST GOING ON TOP OF THE SLIDE IF YOU CLICKED ON. WELL THAT'S A BIGGER BOX. THERE YOU GO. ONE MORE FERRY ARE NOW WE SEE IT. ONE IS GOING TO DO IT WITHOUT MY NOTES BECAUSE I'VE DONE THIS TALK A MILLION TIMES AND HOPEFULLY HAVE A TOUCHING ALL THE MAIN POINTS THAT I WANT TO- I'M REALLY EXCITED HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THIRTY BY THIRTY. I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR OPENING REMARKS VERY HELPFUL- AND APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THIS IS BEEN A GREAT YEAR- AND I WILL TELL RIGHT. SO AS YOU- BY THIRTY WAS ESTABLISHED BY. GOVERNOR NUISANCE NATURE BASICALLY. EXECUTIVE ORDER AND OCT. OF TWENTY TWENTY. THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER IS ACTUALLY BROADER. HAS A OF A- VARIETY OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES EMBEDDED WITHIN IT BUT THE ONE THAT DEFINITELY GETS A LOT OF THE ATTENTION IS OUR COMMITMENT TO CONSERVE 30% OF OUR LANDS AND COASTAL WATERS BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTED THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING THIRTY BY THIRTY. AND TO DO SO WHEN. ROBUST INCLUSIVE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT- AND I'M VERY EXCITED TO TELL YOU THAT. THAT IS WHAT WE DID OVER THE LAST YEAR. WE HAD A LOT IN TOTAL SEVENTEEN WORKSHOPS IN A YEAR WHICH I THINK IS POTENTIALLY UNPRECEDENTED. AND WE DID IT IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS BECAUSE OF COURSE WE'RE ON ZOOM AND COULDN'T BE WITH PEOPLE IN PERSON. BUT WE HELD- NINE REGIONAL WORKSHOPS MOVING AROUND THE STATE TO ASK DIFFERENT- PEOPLE WHAT. KINDS OF CONTRIBUTION. THERE ARE IN DIFFERENT- REGIONS OF THE STATE WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES WHAT WORKS WHEN IT COMES TO CONSERVATION STRATEGIES. WE HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT TOPICAL WORKSHOPS WHERE WE BROUGHT IN EXPERTS ON DIFFERENT TOPICS AND ASKED FOR THEIR THOUGHTS. AND THEY PRESENTED A WHITE PAPER WHICH THEN WE SOLICITED PUBLIC FEEDBACK- TO THAT WHITE PAPER SO IT'S SORT OF AN ONLINE FORUM AND DISCUSSION AND WE DID THAT FOR. TOPICS AROUND EQUITY CLIMATE CHANGE HOW TO PROTECT BIODIVERSITY AS WELL AS- HOW WE DEFINE CONSERVATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIRTY BY THIRTY. WE HAD AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE- WHERE WE SOLICITED INPUT FROM FOLKS THAT WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ASK FOR IN THE REGIONAL WORKSHOPS. WE'VE HAD OVER SEVENTY TRIBAL CONSULTATIONS ON CONVERSATIONS WE RECEIVED OVER ONE THOUSAND LETTERS OVER FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE HONEST OUR- KNOWING. I COULD GO ON IT WAS A REALLY ROBUST YEAR FRIEDMAN ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT REVIEWED OUR DRAFT MADE PUBLIC MEETINGS SINCE THEN AND WE STILL HAVE A WEBSITE CALIFORNIA NATURE DOT CA DOT GOV. FOR ALL THE INFORMATION ALL THE WORKSHOPS ALL THE WHITE PAPERS ARE HOUSED. TO LOTS OF ROBUST PUBLIC FEEDBACK WHICH HAS JUST BEEN TREMENDOUSLY VALUABLE. FOR DEVELOPING OUR DRAFT DOCUMENT. SO DID ISSUE DRAFT. DOCUMENT CALLED PATHWAYS TO THIRTY BY THIRTY AND I'M GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH THAT. WE RELEASED IN DECEMBER OUR COMMENT PERIOD CLOSED IN ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH SO JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WE'VE BEEN INCORPORATING ALL THE GREAT FEEDBACK WE GOT FROM THE PUBLIC- AGAIN CLOSE TO A THOUSAND LETTERS- SOME OF WHICH WERE QUITE LONG SO VERY VERY HELPFUL- INFORMATION THAT WE'RE INCORPORATING. SORT BY STAR. IS ORGANIZED- AROUND SORT OF A FEW MAIN SECTIONS THE FIRST IS OUR CONSERVATION FRAMEWORK- WITH THREE KEY OBJECT FOR ACHIEVING THIRTY BY THIRTY. FIRST PROTECT BIODIVERSITY THIS IS REALLY A CROWDED IN THE INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT FOR THIRTY BY THIRTY IT'S REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT. THE PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT WE RELY ON FOR OUR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES- ARE. ARE EGGS CAN PERSIST ACROSS THE GLOBE. WE'VE COURSE ALSO KNOW pCAN EXPAND. TO NATURE AND PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE OF THE OUTDOORS. AND OUR LANDS CAN BE USED TO MEDICATE- OF SEQUESTER CARBON AND BUILD RESILIENCE TO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SO THESE ARE THREE KEY OBJECTIVES. WE ALSO THREE CORE COMMITMENTS THAT REALLY SHOULD GOVERN EVERYTHING THAT WE DO- AS WE IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGY WE WANT TO WORK TO ADVANCE JUSTICE EQUITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. ALWAYS TO STRENGTHEN OUR TRIBAL PARTNERSHIPS. AND IN THE CONTEXT OF DURING OUR CONSERVATION PROTECT OUR ACADEMIC PROSPERITY OUR CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES AND OUR FOOD SUPPLY. WE PUT FORWARD A DEFINITION FOR WHAT OUR THIRTY BY THIRTY CONSERVATION AREAS SO HOW WE WILL COUNT TO THIRTY WE HAVE TO DEFINE WHAT WE'RE COUNTING. SO THIS IS THE DEFINITION WE PUT OUT IN OUR DRAFT LAND AND COASTAL WATER AREAS THAT ARE DURABLY PROTECTED AND MANAGED TO SUPPORT FUNCTIONAL ECOSYSTEMS BOTH INTACT AND RESTORED AND THE SPECIES THAT RELY ON THEM. SO REALLY TWO PIECES OF OUR DEFINITION THE PLACE SHOULD BE PROTECTED FOR- FUNCTIONAL ECOSYSTEMS FOR BIODIVERSITY AND THAT PROTECTION SHOULD BE DURABLE. WHEN IT COMES TO LANDS ARE 24% OF CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY MEETS THAT DEFINITION AND THIS REALLY SHOWS UP ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF USES AND LANDSCAPES THIS INCLUDES DEDICATED CONSERVATION AREAS. RECREATIONAL LANDS AND OPEN SPACES AND A FAIR NUMBER ARE WORKING LANDS THAT ARE UNDER CONSERVE EASEMENT FOR CONSERVATION VALUES BUT CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. YOU KNOW GRAZING OR OR- TIMBER IT A SUSTAINABLE WAY ABOUT THESE LANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL CONSERVATION TO THE FUNCTIONING OF THESE SORT OF SPECIAL CONSERVATION AREAS AND THAT THEY EXIST IN A BROADER MATRIX OF- CONSERVATION EFFORTS THAT ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT. I'M GONNA TURN THE SCREEN OVER TO MARK GOAL HE'S GONNA TALK LITTLE BIT ABOUT- FROM THE PLAYS OUT IN OUR COASTAL WATERS MARK. DR NORRIS ON. ON THE CONSERVATION OF COASTAL WATERS- YEAH BUT A FEW THINGS SORT OF WORKING AT THE SAME TIME ON. WE HAVE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 16% OF COASTAL WATERS ON YOUR OPTIC CALIFORNIA. OUR NETWORK OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS THAT TWENTY FOUR MPAS. ON IS A NETWORK IT'S REALLY SAD AND IN THE MIDST OF A DECADE- REVIEW OF THAT NETWORK AND SO WE HAVE WE HAVE PROMISED. STAKEHOLDERS ON ALL SIDES THAT- WE WON'T MAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON MODIFYING THE MPA NETWORK ON INTEL THE CATTLE REVIEW IS. WHICH WILL BE- ON THE FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR. I'M AND THEN WHAT'S HAVING SHOULD BE A MODIFICATION OR NOT- ON THAT. TURNING YOUR CALL I THINK OKAY SO WHAT DO GET ADDITIONAL- FOURTEEN AND JUST AS A REMINDER TO EVERYBODY. MPAS ARE NOT ALL NO TAKE ON AREAS I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO KNOW. ON A LOT OF THEM ARE ARE CON. FOCUSED ON WHICH WOULD ALLOW SOME COMMERCIAL TAKE. OR MARC. RECREATIONAL TAKE THE ON WHICH M. P. EIGHT S. AND SO ON THAT THAT FROM 9% ARE NO TAKE AND 7% ARE ON. OUR CONSERVATION BASED JUSTICE FOR BACK PROPERTY. BODY SO I'M GETTING A THIRD- WHAT WE TALKED IS THE- OF REALLY. OUR WERE TO- WITH THE GOVERNMENT IS THE AND I NORA- OBVIOUS- THE BY MINISTRATION HIS MAY US. SO OF PLAN. ON THIRTY THIRTY ARMS WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY WORKING WITH THEM ON ASPEN SANCTUARIES. FIVE NAZARIAN REYES ARE LED ON BY NOW WHAT IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THEY MAKE UP. CURRENTLY MORE THAN 40% OF OUR COASTAL WATERS AWAY OVER THIRTY. FIVE ENDS AND I YOU HAVE A STAKEHOLDER- BASED MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENT WHERE THE STATE IS VERY HEAVILY INVOLVED ALL STAKEHOLDER GROUPS ARE INVOLVED BUT IT'S FISHING COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY BUSINESS INSIDER. ON OUR ARE PART OF THIS NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES EFFORT IT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ON POTENTIAL MOVING FORWARD IN THIS PATHWAY DOT. ON TO- WOULD TO DO AND- SANK DISTRICT STRENGTHENING CONSERVATION BETTER MEET THE DEFINITION THE DOCTOR NORTH TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. AND THOSE WOULD INCLUDE- THINGS TO CONSIDER WOULD BE STRENGTHENING OUR QUALITY AND INVASIVE SPECIES- PROTECTION AND SEED BASSIL REDUCTION. ON PROTECT- MARINE MAMMALS ON ENHANCE DURABILITY OF EXISTING CON. BASED FISHERIES MAN APPROACHES. WATSON OR TO MATCH APPROACH IS LIKE WITH DIFFERENT THIS CALL. AND THE RAMP ON THOSE ARE SOME. OF WHAT WE COULD BE DEALING ANNOUNCEMENTS REYES SO NONE OF THAT BEEN DETERMINED I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT- WERE WITH- SAY. AND THEN MEANS THANKS FOR MOVING FORWARD ON DOING THAT I'M SEE THERE'S THAT YOU MUST. REPUBLIC JIM HERITAGE. THANKS REYES WELL. ON IN WHICH LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES- TO REALLY DEVELOP FURTHER WITHOUT BACK TO DR. NORTH THANKS MARC. SO ARE MARK MEANT THAT WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD ABOUT HOW A MILLION OF ONE TO- GET TO THIRTY PER AND ABOUT TO MILLION OF LAND AND HE I DON'T SOME OF THE WAYS WE MIGHT DO IN COASTAL WATERS IN OUR PATHWAY DOCUMENT WE I. AS OF PATHWAY TO THIRTY BY THIRTY I'M GONNA TOUCH ON THESE HERE HERE HERE ANY MENTION OF SOME OF WHAT WE'RE THINKING OF IN THE COASTAL WHY. SO FUNDAMENTAL WHY OF EXCEL RE LAY CONS WE REALLY FOR ARE ARE LOCAL PARTNER NO BEST WHERE HARD WORK OF IDENTIFYING IMPORTANT AREAS FOR COMMUNITIES SO ONE OF EXELA BACK CONSERVE- EXIT STRATEGICALLY ACQUISITIONS BY ADDITIONAL TO ACQUIRE WE WANT TO INCREASE BOB CONSERVATION EASEMENTS ENHANCE CONSERVATION OF EXISTING PUBLIC LANDS AND WATERS AS MARK WAS TALKING ABOUT OF COURSE WE HAVE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL WITHIN OUR FEDERAL OTHER FEDERAL LANDS LIKE FORESTS OF THE FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE IT'S ULTRA WE WANT TO INSTITUTIONALIZE ADVANCE MEDICATION WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE CONSERVATION BY- MORE STRATEGICALLY- USING MEDICATION ACROSS OUR LANDSCAPE PARTICULARLY FOR LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS- PLACING THAT MITIGATION IN PLACES THAT WE MOST NEED IT AND IN IN WAYS THAT ARE MORE STRATEGIC. ONE OF AND EXCEL IN BAR RESTORATION WE CAN'T JUST PROTECT OUR WAY OUT OF THE BIODIVERSITY CRISIS WE NEED TO RESTORE- IMPORTANT LANDSCAPES- WE WANT TO STRENGTHEN OUR COORDINATION AMONG GOVERNMENTS AND KEY PARTNERS THIS IS REALLY SPEAKING TO OUR OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE FUNDSAND RESOURCES WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS WITH TRAVEL PARTNERS. HOPEFULLY ALL SAW THE EXCITING ANNOUNCEMENT ON FRIDAY THAT WE LIKE TO INVEST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TRIBAL RELATIONSHIPS TO ADVANCE CONSERVATION- WITH THEM. WE WANT TO OUR INVEST WERE ABOUT INTERNALLY EXTERNALLY TO REALLY MAXIMIZE OUR CONSERVATION BENEFITS LOOK FOR WAYS THAT ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT GRANTS AND BOND PROGRAMS CAN WORK TOGETHER MORE SYNERGISTICALLY WITH OUR EXTERNAL- FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. I FINALLY- WE REALLY NEED TO EVALUATE CONSERVATION OUTCOMES AND MAKE SURE WERE ADAPTIVELY MANAGING AND STEWARDING THOSE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE. SO THE DOCUMENT GOES THROUGH ALL THESE PATHWAYS AND IDENTIFIES KEY NEXT STEP ACTIONS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN. ANOTHER GREAT THING THAT'S HAPPENING AS PART OF OUR INITIATIVE IS A WE HAVE CREATED- WHAT WE CALL CA NATURE ARE GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM THIS IS AN ONLINE SUITE OF INTERACTIVE MAPPING TOOLS. THAT GO FROM VERY ACCESSIBLE TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW GIS TO EXTREMELY WONKY IF YOU LOVE TO PLAY WITH DATA- THIS IS ONLINE AT CALIFORNIA NATURE DOT CA DOT GOV- FUNDAMENTALLY THIS ALLOWS US TO. AND SEE ALL TOGETHER IN THE SAME MAP WHERE ARE THESE KIND. AREAS AND WHERE ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO ADVANCE MORE CONSERVATION MAYBE BY- CONNECTING TO OTHER EXISTING PLACES ARE BUILDING WILDLIFE. FOR EXAMPLE WE PROVIDE- OVERLAYS OF WHERE BIODIVERSITY. ARE WHAT THE PROJECTED OF CLIMATE CONDITIONS WILL BE AS WELL AS WHERE WE HAVE ACCESS- WHERE WE'RE PROTECTED AREAS HAVE ACCESS- FOR THE PUBLIC. SO WE REALLY THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE COVER. ABOUT HOW WE CAN ADVANCE THIRTY BY THIRTY TOGETHER AND SPEAK A COMMON LANGUAGE. AS I ALLUDED TO REALLY SEE- THIRTY BY THIRTY AS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND WE REALLY WANT TO EMPOWER PARTNERS WHO ARE EXTREMELY EXCITED ABOUT THIS INITIATIVE. SO WE SEE REGIONAL COALITIONS REGIONAL EFFORTS AS SORT OF THE CORE OF THE WORK WE WANT TO DO. OUR PARTNERSHIP OBVIOUSLY WOULD INCLUDE TRAVEL PARTNERS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA BIODIVERSITY COUNCIL WHICH HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHICH IS A COALITION OF FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON BIODIVERSITY SINCE THE BY DEMONSTRATION COMMITTED TO THIRTY BY THIRTY WE SEE THIS AS A GREAT. SPACE IDENTIFY WAYS TO WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND IDENTIFY UP. FOR CONSERVE. WE ALSO- ARE WORKING WITH THE K. BIODIVERSE NETWORK WHICH IS A- CONSORTIUM OF ACADEMICS AND PRACTITIONERS WERE THINKING ABOUT THE KEY SCIENCE AND MONITORING QUESTIONS- THAT WE NEED TO EXPLORE TO REALLY MAKE SURE THIRTY BY THIRTY IS MEETING OUR KEY OBJECTIVES. AND THEN FUNDAMENTALLY WITHIN CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO USE OUR DEPARTMENTS AND CONSERVANCY IS TO HELP ADVANCE THIRTY BY THIRTY. SO WE'VE SEEN THIS CONSTELLATION OF GROUPS AS REALLY HELPING US GET THE WORK DONE. AS YOU WILL RECALL THERE ARE SOME REALLY IMPORTANT INITIAL INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE THAT ARE GOING TO HELP US JUMP START THIS EFFORT. THERE'S THE NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS SET ASIDE FROM LAST SUMMER SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN COASTAL. FUNDS WHICH WE THINK A LOT OF THAT WILL HELP ADVANCE OUR THIRTY BY THIRTY EFFORT. THERE'S OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN HABITAT RESTORATION FUNDS ONE HUNDRED FIVE MILLION WILDLIFE QUARTERS WE REALLY THINK WERE MORE WELL POSITIONED TO GET GOING ON IMPLEMENTING THIS. STRATEGY WE'RE EXCITED TO GET THAT UNDER WAY. AND WITH THAT I'LL STAY SHARING AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR US THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK DR NORRIS MR GOLD'S. ANYONE WHEN. I THINK THAT IS THE GROWTH OF THE PRESENT I THINK MR GOLDWYN THE METAL DO WE HAVE WE ARE MYSTICAL TO PRESENTATION RIGHT. YEAH I GOT TO GO TO TALK ABOUT THE HOST THAT'S RIGHT OKAY WE'RE JUST CHECKING IN. GOT A QUESTION ALBERTANS ON CLOSER. OKAY PUT WAS GONNA GO. CHAU SIR THANK YOU ON COUPLE QUESTIONS. AS WE BY UP DIALED BIO. BIODIVERSITY NETWORK. I WE WERE LOOKING AT- WHEN THE INITIATIVE WAS LAUNCHED THERE WERE A LOT OF KICK- COMMITMENTS TO PURSUE VOLUNTARY CONVERSATIONS ACTIONS IN A WORK HANDS HANDS IN GLOVE WITH PRIVATE LANDOWNERS. BUT IN LOOKING AT THE DRAFT SOME OF THE TOOLS AND PRACTICES OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS DO WILL NOT BE COUNTED INTO THIRTY CALL 30% GOAL I JUST HELPED SET UP FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF PAULA POLLINATOR HABITAT PROGRAM. AT THE C. D. F. THAT THAT WE HAVE IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY- BIO DIVERSITY BENEFITS. WHY WON'T THAT BE COUNTED AT. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SOMEONE AT. REMIND YOU THAT THE THIRTY BY THIRTY INITIATIVE IS PART OF THAT BROADER NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER INTENDS TO DRIVE ON ALL OF THESE REALLY IMPORTANT EFFORTS THAT PROMOTE BIODIVERSITY AND ADVANCE- CLIMATE ACTION ON OUR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS SO. POLLINATOR SO HEALTH WE'RE WITH FORMER AND RANCHERS TO IDENTIFY SO TO SUPPORT ARE SCOPING PLAN FOR EXAMPLE THOSE ARE ALL ENCAPSULATED IN THAT BROADER EXECUTIVE ORDER THIRTY MAY THIRTY IN SORT OF A SPECIAL CASE THIS IS THE KIND OF CONSERVATION THAT'S A LITTLE HIGHER LEVEL BECAUSE IT HAS THAT DURING. AND THAT- PRIORITY FOR ABOUT SO THE WAY WE SEE IT IS- ADJACENT LAND THAT MIGHT HAVE REALLY IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE PRACTICES FOR BIODIVERSITY THAT MAYBE THOSE PROTECTIONS AREN'T TERRIBLE FOR% ONE REASON OR ANOTHER THEY CONTRIBUTE TO OUR BROADER OBJECTIVES- EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT SPECIFICALLY OF THE THIRTY BY THIRTY AREAS THAT WERE COUNTING EFFORTS BE ADVANCED AS WELL AND THAT'S WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING GOOD THANK YOU. AND I YOUR QUESTION HISTORY OF A WIN COME TO YOU YOU COME MORE. I CAN MR WARD. THANK YOU DO YOU MIND IF I TO QUESTION. THANK YOU I'M NORTH YOU SO MUCH FOR PRESENT I THINK HUMANS A LOT OF OUR PARTNERS I'M VERY EXCITED FOR THIS INITIATIVE AND CONGRATULATIONS ON. ALL THE HARD WORK THAT WENT INTO LAST YEAR I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR WELL THIS CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE- PARTICULARLY- EXCITED FOR YOUR FOCUS ON REGIONAL PARTICIPATION- SAN DIEGO COUNTY IS ONE OF IF NOT THE MOST BIODIVERSE- COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW WE HAVE- THE GREATEST NUMBER OF- PLANT SPECIES NUMBER OF BIRD SPECIES AND I'M SURE ELSEWHERE ON THE- FLOOR AND FUNDED CHANGE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TO CELEBRATE- AND I AM HOPING THAT AS YOU ARE DEVELOPING THIS GOAL SETTING AND YOU ARE HEADING TOWARDS YOU KNOW SORT OF YOUR SIX MILLION. ACRE OF- TARGET- THAT THAT WE DOING OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT IS PROPORTIONAL OF. THAT I GOALS PROPORTIONALLY ACHIEVE STATEWIDE SO THAT I SAW ON ON THE STATE MY MAP THE HEAD OVER THERE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF EXISTING NATIONAL PARKS AND STATE PARKS AND OTHER CONSERVE LANDS THAT'S GREAT THAT WE'VE DONE THAT TO DEAN- BUT- THAT WE DON'T. GET TO A STATEWIDE- GOAL THAT SOMEHOW CONCENTRATES THAT- IN IN CERTAIN AREAS THAT WERE REALLY MAKING SURE THROUGH THAT REGIONAL PARTICIPATION THAT WE ARE ACHIEVING THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST THERE I'M WONDERING- FOR SOME OF OUR LOCAL- CONSERVE LANES DEDICATED LANDS I MEAN C. P. TERRITORY IS THAT ALSO SOMETHING THAT WOULD FILTER. THE SORT OF- THE- THE ACHIEVEMENT OR OR THE FOR THE REGISTERING OF. OF WHETHER NOT WERE MEETING THAT GOAL. YEAH ABSOLUTELY YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- SO YOU MENTION- IT SEEMS. AND NCC PIECE OF THESE APPLICANTS CONSERVATION PLANS AND HABITAT CONSERVATION PLANS. YOU KNOW I SEE THOSE KIND OF THE GOLD STANDARD FOR IDENTIFYING WHERE WE SHOULD DO CONSERVATION NEXT AND COMMUNITY DRIVEN CONSERVATION. OF COURSE THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER STRATEGIES THAT GET US TO THE AND SIMILAR KINDS OF PRIORITIES- BUT WE DO IDENTIFY IN THE PATHWAYS DOCUMENT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS REGIONAL APPROACH AND- ENSURING THAT THESE PLANS. ARE COMPLETED AS WELL AS IN- PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT FOR THE PLACES THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE PLANS SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE- MORE REGIONAL CONSERVATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE OR THAT ARE. REALLY WELL RESOURCE AND THEY'VE THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF PLANS ANOTHER PLACE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE- CAPACITY SUPPORT TO HELP PEOPLE- DEVELOP THAT WORK. ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE THANK YOU I KNOW SAN DIEGO PARTNERS ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THAT AND SORT OF MEET OUR PROPORTION AT LEAST ARE PROPORTIONAL GOAL- IN OUR REGION AS WELL SO- THANK YOU FOR- TURNING YOUR ATTENTION TOWARDS REGIONAL COLLABORATION WHERE WE'RE READY FOR THAT- SECONDLY. I IC THROUGHOUT THE REPORT ON THAT THERE IS AN INTEREST IN COOPERATING TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE I KNOW YOU'RE AWARE OF INTRODUCED AB. TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE WHICH JUST RECENTLY PASSED OUT OF OUR ASSEMBLY NOT RESOURCES COMMITTEE THAT WILL WORK WITH THAT NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT IS CODIFIED POLICY. THAT- I APPRECIATE BEING HE'S BEEN IT HAD- AND THAT THE DIALOGUE WITH OUR TRIBAL I'M PARTNERS- AND THAT- AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT LAST WEEK- FOR THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SET ASIDE TO HELP- TRANSITION SOME OF THOSE LANDS BACK INTO THE CARE OF THE FIRST PEOPLES- TO BE ABLE TO. WORK ON THE STRATEGIES I IT'S A TWO QUESTIONS ONE- WOULD. AND YOU KNOW GOING FOR SEVERAL YEARS YOU KNOW WHAT THAT TRANSFER OF LAND- WERE TO GO BACK INTO- A SOVEREIGN NATION TERRITORY WITHOUT ALSO COUNT. TOWARD OUR STATE GOALS- AND THEN SECONDLY CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW TO U. K. AS A GENERAL. ON HOW WE MANAGE LANDS. CAN BENEFIT THE STATE IN AND- MAY. CONSERVATION SO I THINK THAT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT ONE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH- WITH THE TRAVEL PARTNERS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD COUNT THEIR LANDS SO I THINK CONCEPTUALLY OF COURSE THEY BENEFIT OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVES- BUT I'M ALSO SENSITIVE TO NOT PUTTING OTHER. NATIONS LAND MAPS SO WE'RE WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT I THINK THAT'S A CONVERSATION TO HAVE BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF CONTRIBUTED THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES OF BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE ABSOLUTELY- AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TEEKAY- YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT IS. OBVIOUS FROM ALL THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD IS THAT THERE ARE SOME. DEEP ARE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW BECAUSE FUNCTION AND THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH TO LEARN FROM OUR PART. AS WE WORK TO MANAGE THESE LANDS AND STORED THEM INTO THE FUTURE SO YOU KNOW OUR INTEREST ABSOLUTELY IS AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT- THAT INFORMATION SHARING THAT STAND IN A RESPECTFUL WAY. CONTINUES AND THAT WE BRING THAT KNOWLEDGE INTO THE WORK THAT WE DO AND THAT'S WHAT PART OF WHAT IS ENVISIONED BY THIS- THE SENATE SIDE IS REALLY TO CREATE A SPACE WHERE THOSE CONVERSATIONS CAN HAPPEN AND WHERE WE CAN. WHERE WE CAN BUILD THAT UNDERSTANDING KEYRINGER MISTER BIGELOW IN THE MISTER BENNETT. I THANK YOU TAKE YOUR PRESENTATION- JUST HELP US TO START OFF MAYBE GIVE US SOME THE RUDIMENTARY LIKE CALIFORNIA'S COMPRISED OF HOW MANY ACRES. FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE FIVE SINCE THIS AT A HUNDRED FOR BUT IT'S LESS TAKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE AND GO WITH IT SO OUT OF THAT PATTERN FIVE HOW MANY ACRES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE OWNED BY STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OR CONTROLLED I THINK IN A WAY THAT'S MANAGED OR PROTECTED CURRENTLY. IT'S IN A 50% RANGE VERY GOOD YEAH SO HAVE WE ALREADY MET THE GOAL. OF PRESERVING 50% OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EXCEEDING BY TWENTY MILLION ACRES THE GOVERNOR'S ULTIMATE GOAL. WE'VE ALREADY DONE IT NOW YOU'VE GOT TO GET DOWN INTO YOUR MATRIX OF WHY HAVE YOU DISCOUNT IT ALL OF THOSE OTHER ACRES IN FACT LET'S JUST SAY IT'S FORTY EIGHT MILLION BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S SENSIBLE TALLEST. OF THAT NUMBER YOU'RE SAYING ONLY HALF OF THAT QUALIFIES EXPLAIN TO US WHY HALF IN FACT MORE THAN HALF OF THE NATION'S PRETTIEST. NATIONAL PARK YOU SOMEBODY IS NOT INCLUDED. IN YOUR BILL. YOU DON'T INCLUDE ALL OF YOU SOMEBODY. IN YOUR FACTOR SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY A LOT OF THINGS AREN'T REALLY ON THE TABLE. AYE THAT'S SURPRISING TO ME I WOULD NEED TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE MAP IF THAT IS TRUE I WAS SO WHEN I LOOK AT ALL THE INFORMATION. YEAH I. I NEED TO GO TO REPRESENT THE AERATION SO THAT'S MY CONCERN. IT GOT IT'S NOT A QUESTION IS JUST NO NO I DON'T KNOW. SO THIS IS THIS IS GOING TO GET WE DO BUT I WILL I WILL TRY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION A COUPLE WAYS AND ALL OF THE LOSE THE FRIEND- FIRST YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT DISCOUNTING THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL OF THE- FEDERAL AND STATE LAND THAT IS ALREADY. LARGELY YOU KNOW MANAGEMENT HELD BY GOVERNMENTS BUT MANY OF THOSE ARE MULTIPLE USE LANDS AND THEY'RE NOT PRIMARILY PROTECTING OUR BIODIVERSITY AND WHAT THIRTY BY THIRTY IS TRYING TO DO IS TO TRY TO MOVE BEYOND- SOME OF THAT. SOME OF THAT MANAGEMENT MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT THIS PROTECTED PLACES THAT CONSERVE OUR BRAND DIVERSITY AT FUNDAMENTAL IT DOESN'T SAY THAT THAT OTHER CONSERVATION IS AN IMPORTANT IN FACT IF I GO BACK TO MY EARLIER COMMENTS. THE MAJOR IN WHICH THE CAN AREAS EXIST IS VERY IMPORTANT AND HOW THEY ARE MANAGED IS INCREDIBLY HIGH VALUE. SO THAT'S ONE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE MAPS- ONE THING WE LEARNED SO WE USED- TO EXISTING DATASETS TO BEGIN OUR MAPPING EFFORT NICE IT BEGAN BECAUSE THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE DONE TO REFINE THESE MAPS BUT- WE RELIED ON THE U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY THEY DID A NATIONWIDE EVALUATION OF ALL. OF PUBLICLY OWNED LAND FROM WILDERNESS AREAS TO- BOAT RAMPS AND CLASSIFIED THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR LEVEL OF PROTECTION. SO THESE FOR GAP CODES ONE TWO THREE FOUR. AND WE SAID THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO WE THINK CODE ONE AND LARGELY MEET OUR DEATH. HELLO HAS AN AN- DATA SAID CALLED TE PROTECTIVE AIR CALIFORNIA PROTECTED AREAS DATABASE SO IT STEPS DOWN FROM THIS USGS CLASSIFICATION. AND THAT- MAPS ALL THE DIFFERENT OPEN SPACES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE PUT THOSE MAPS OUT DURING OUR DRAFT IS A WHOLE BUNCH OF PLACES THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS GAP ONE AND TWO. FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER ARE NOT FOUND ON OUR MAPS. MOST NOTABLY ARE PLACES LIKE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS WERE- PRIVATE LANDOWNERS HAVE PUT THEIR LAND UNDER EASEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONSERVATION I'M THINKING ABOUT GRAZING LANDS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO PROTECTING OUR VERNAL POOL ECOSYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE. THOSE DON'T SHOW UP ON OUR MAPS ONE REASON OR ANOTHER MY GUESS IS. THAT EASEMENTS ARE ON PAPER AND THEY'RE IN SOMEBODY'S FILE DRAWER SO WE'RE ACTUALLY USING THIS PROCESS TO- GET THOSE PLACES ON OUR MAPS. I NEED TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT YOUR SOMEBODY BECAUSE I WAS PRETTY SURE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE SO IF YOU SOMEBODY. IT'S THAT I DIDN'T KNOW SO I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AND FIGURE THAT OUT BUT IT SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE INCLUDED. YEAH I WOULD JUST FOR THE COMMITTEE. WHAT WE'RE HEARING WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS TWENTY FOUR- MILLION ACRES ROUGHLY R. WE WANT TO GET THE THIRTY AND SO GIVEN THAT SAID IT'S JUST. IRONIC THAT A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND PRESERVE SUCH AS EASEMENTS SUCH AS WHEN HIS NAP PROGRAMS. NOW YOU HAVE MULTIPLE KINDS OF DIFFERENT EASEMENT PLATFORMS BUT THOSE ARE BEING COUNTED. AND WHEN I'M JUST SITTING TELLING YOU IS WE WORK. THAT NUMBER. BY A 100% OF WHAT THEIR PROJECTING AND WHAT THEY'D LIKE TO ACHIEVE. I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE INFORMATION WE'RE RECEIVING. AND THE GENUINENESS NOT THE JUST BAJOR BURIED YOU OR ANYONE THAT'S WORKED HARD AT THIS. PETER FACT THAT YOU CAN JUST GOOGLE AND YOU CAN LOOK UP RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK IT'S UNFAIR OF US TO NOT TAKE THOSE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION ESPECIALLY SINCE THE BIO DIVERSITY IS AN IMPORTANT THING. AND WE FORGET THOSE COASTAL AREAS THAT ARE ACTUALLY UNDER WATER THAT ARE PROTECTED AS WELL NOT CALCULATED OR FORMULATED INTO THE PRESENTATION. IT'S REALLY HARD FOR US FOR SOMEONE WHO'S TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS. SO I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU MEDICARE I KNOW MISS GARCIA HAD ANOTHER QUESTION. THE AD THEY GIVE US REGULAR MISTER BENNETT'S NEXT AND THEN WE'LL GO TO ASK OUR THOUGHT HE- YES WITH IT JUST STIMULATE. A LITTLE BIT OF RESPONSIBLE I BELIEVE THAT ALL THE RIPARIAN SANCTUARY AREAS ARE INCLUDED AND I. AT AND CAN WE GET A CONFIRMATION OF THE RAIN CHECK SURE AREAS INCLUDED. IN THE THIRTY BY THIRTY I BELIEVE THEY ARE. WELL MASKING NOW THE- GOLF. HE YEAH SO ON I THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENEFIT QUESTION ON. THEY ARE NOT AND HERE'S WHY AND THIS GETS TO THE THIS GETS TO THE DISCUSSION- IT'S JUST A CARD WHICH IS CURRENTLY A NATIONAL SANCTUARIES ONE MAJOR THING THAT THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON I'M A CONSERVATION PERSPECTIVE IS THAT YOU CAN'T DO OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION AND YOU CAN'T DO. ON EXTRACTION AND ALSO SEABED MINING THOSE SORTS OF THINGS BONTA THAT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL I DON'T MEAN A DISCOUNT THAT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. S. THE OF THIS IS THERE'S A CONSISTENCY IN THEIR FROM THE STANDPOINT OF. OURS ARE POLLUTION POLLUTION PREVENTION REQUIREMENTS IS THERE MY THEIR FISHING REQUIREMENTS ON FOR EXTRACTION AND ANY OF THOSE OTHER SORTS OF THINGS. AND SO RIGHT NOW THERE IS. A LITTLE BIT OF A DISAGREEMENT IT'S NOT A DOING ON THIS BUT IT APPEARS THAT THEY WILL COUNT THEN ASKED ME THANKS REYES. I'M BUT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF. BY- DIVERSE PROTECTION IN THIS IS THIS IS REALLY A CRITICAL PART OF THIS DISCUSSION. IS THAT ON THERE'S THE BANKING RIGHT NOW STAFF AND WE BELIEVE ME THIS IS. IT HOW DO WE GET TO THIRTY BY THIRTY NOT GET TO THIRTY BY TOMORROW. ON AND SO ON THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE NEED TO WORK. WITH COMMUNITIES WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS ON THE GET THESE SORTS OF DISCUSSIONS AND SO. ON FOR NASH MEANS SANCTUARIES AND WE'VE ALREADY STARTED A DISCUSSION WITH- SOME OF THE DIRECTORS OF THE SANCTUARIES. ON YOU KNOW THEY'RE VERY VERY OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS ON WHAT ELSE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROTECT OUR BIODIVERSITY. SO THAT'S WHERE I WAS GIVING EXAMPLES STARTED JUMPING AHEAD. ON THINGS LIKE A VESSEL'S SPEED ONE THAT BE YOUR PROJECT I REMEMBER ALL ON IN YOUR DISTRICT AS YOU NOW- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WELL STRIKES ON ON AND SO THAT'S- NOT SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY WANT TO GET BETTER AT SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT LEVEL OF PROTECTION THAT COULD BE. ADDED THERE ARE WHERE THE TEND NOT BECOMES A SPEED ON THAT RATHER THAN NON VOLUNTARY FOR LARGER VESSELS. ON POLLUTION PREVENTION ON AGAIN I KNOW YOU I KNOW YOU'RE YOU HAVE A STRONG BACKGROUND. ON THIS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF RUNOFF POLLUTION WHAT CAN WE DO TO REDUCE PLASTIC POLLUTION IN AN AREA THOSE ARE BIODIVERSITY MEASURES THAT ARE NOT. I HAVE NO TAKE NO CHANG I MEAN NO FOR. THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. AND SO ON. THAT'S AND I LIKE THAT WE REALLY LOOK. TO HAVE. YOU THEM AND THE MONEY AND YEARS AHEAD. ON TO GET THEIR SORE FEELING IS. THAT ON THE CURRENT LEVEL OF CONSERVATION PROVIDED BY NASA MEANS SANCTUARIES. IS A GREAT START BUT IT DOES NOT MEET THE DURABILITY DEFINITION. FOR THE BIO DIVERSITY PROTECTION. DEFINITION ON THE DOCTOR NORRIS LAID OUT IN THE DOCUMENT. IF I TOOK THIS RUNNING BACK REAL QUICK SO I THINK THERE'S ONE THING MISSING FROM THIS CONVERSATION THAT I WOULD JUST LIKE. YOU TO ADDRESS WHICH IS NOBODY HAS DEFINED TERRIBLE WE JUST KEEP SAYING THEY HAVE TO BE. TERRIBLY PROTECTED BUT- AS AN ATTORNEY I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. WHICH I THINK MIGHT GET TO PART OF WHAT MR BIGELOW IS SAYING IF THERE'S A CONSERVATION EASEMENT FOR TWENTY YEARS. I WOULD ASSUME THAT'S NOT TERRIBLY PROTECTIVE- WE HAVE NO DEFINITION AT THIS POINT. WHAT IS IT OR IS IT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ARE MEANS BY TO. ACTUALLY IT I CAN ACTUALLY NO BUT I MEAN THE THIRTY BY THIRTY DEFINITION MISTER GONNA YOURS NO I LIKE ONLINE BUT IT'S NOT MINE IT'S JUST EIGHTY CALIFORNIA'S. IT'S AN IN PERPETUITY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THREE PARTIES LANDOWNER THE LOCAL AND THE STATE. ANY ONE OF THE LOCAL. OR THE STATE CAN- ASKED TO BREAK THAT AGREEMENT. BUT IT'S ADORABLE AGREEMENT THAT GOES IN PERPETUITY AND TELL SOMETHING IS BROKEN AND IT HAS TO TAKE THE ORIGINAL LANDOWNERS. AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE THEN FOLLOWS UP WITH IT IT CAN. IN MOST CASES AGREED TO DOING AWAY WITH THAT AGREEMENT BUT IN MOST CASES IT WON'T RIGHT SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE HOW THEY'RE DEFINING UNDER THIRTY OR THIRTY DURABLE SO THAT. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS DURABLE BY THE RECOGNITION SO DOCTORS DO YOU MIND ADDRESSING THIS QUESTION. AND I SURE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO- SO IN THE DOCUMENT DO LIVE WHAT WE MEAN BY DURABLE I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL GREAT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT- SUPER WILLIAMS ACTORS TWENTY YEARS ENOUGH WE LEAVE ROOM FOR THAT BUT BUT FUNDAMENTALLY WE TALK ABOUT- LANDS THAT ARE IN PUBLIC OWNERSHIP FOR YOU KNOW PERMANENTLY IN PUBLIC OWNERSHIP FOR BIODIVERSITY PURPOSE THAT'S ADORABLY PROTECTED AREA- CONSERVATION EASEMENTS AS WAS DESCRIBED SO DURABLE- AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THREE PARTIES TO PROTECT SOMEWHAT. CATEGORY BUT ADMINISTRATIVELY PROTECTED AREAS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH A FORMAL RULE MAKING SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFTEN WILL DO A RULEMAKING TRIED SOMETHING A ROADLESS AREA THAT TAKES YEARS OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE WE THINK THAT COUNTS AS A DURABLE PROTECTION OBVIOUSLY IF THAT IS ON DONE THAT NOT CHANGES- OUR OUR CALCULATION BUT- THOSE ARE THE SORT OF THREE CATEGORIES RECEIVED FOR FALLING INTO DURHAM. THANK YOU ARE. THAT OKAY RAND HAD MEDICAL. THANK YOU SO I BELIEVE IT DIDN'T IN- IN RESPONSE TO THE COMMENTS AT WHILE THEY'RE LOTS OF AREA THAT IS IDENTIFIED AS OPEN SPACE WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO DO IS TO HAVE THAT AREA PEOPLE OPEN SPACE AND ALL OF THESE OTHER DEFINITIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE. TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MEETS THE CRITERIA THAT FALL WITH WOULD FALL UNDER THIRTY BY THIRTY AND SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S LEGITIMATE TO ISSUE IS SIMPLY CLARIFYING OUR DEFINITIONS AS AS YOU AS YOU MENTIONED AND THEN FOR ALL OF US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY THIRTY BY THREE. SO TO SAY WERE DONE OR NOT DONE BASED ON HOW MUCH LAND IS OUT THERE WERE WORK WE'RE NOT DONE UNTIL WE CLARIFY OUR DEFINITIONS AND WHEN WE DO THAT AS AS FOR THIS TALKED ABOUT THAT I THINK THAT'S THE EFFORT THAT IS OUT THERE WHAT. YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY HAVE LOTS OF WHICH TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF NATIONAL- FOREST LAND SOME OF THAT LAND IS BEING HEAVILY AND THEY WERE GONNA DO MINING ON A TECH CENTER I'M NOT THAT MUCH I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD SAY HEY WE'RE GONNA COUNT THAT LAND AND SO. OF THE THAT'S THE DISTINCTION BUT THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS- EVAN DERANGED ACTUARY IS- AND THE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS ARE. HUGE IT OFF THE COAST OF- VENTURA COUNTY- IN PARTICULAR AND THERE WAS A REFERENCE MADE BY ONE THE SPEAKERS THAT THEY THAT THAT. THAT THAT NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARY AREAS REPRESENTED 40% OF THE LAND AND I DIDN'T CATCH 40% OF WHAT OF WHAT LANDS SO COULD SOME OF THE WATERS UP. OF ALL THE CURRICULA CAL. IS 4% OVER THE ANTS ANTS IN STATE WATERS IT'S ACTUAL. ON WELL OVER FORTY PERCENT- IT'S INTERNATIONAL ME THANKS VERY. SO OF ALL OF THE OF THE FOR THE WHOLE COAST OF CALIFORNIA PERCENT OF THE STATE WATER HIS NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARY. THAT IS CORRECT CORRECT AND THEN WE HAVE- WE HAVE NO FISHING- MARINE SANCTUARIES OFF THE COAST OF THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. DOES VISIT IF YOU'RE OVER THERE'S NO TAKE IT ALL TREMENDOUS RIVERS TREMENDOUS OPPOSITION WHEN THEY WERE CREATED AND NOW THERE'S TREMENDOUS BIODIVERSITY COMING OUT OF THOSE HOW ARE THEY BEING TREATED. SO THAT SERVICE SO WE HAVE SOME WEIRD OVERLAPS HERE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT AND THAT IS. A GREAT EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE NORTHERN CHANNEL ISLANDS WHERE YOU HAVE- A- AND NOW THANKS. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THIS PART OF THE STATE PROGRAM. MARINE PROTECTED AREAS AND SO WE HAVE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS WHICH HAVE AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF PROTECTION THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE. ON EITHER NO TAKE MPAS ARE LIMITED TAKE CAMP YES- I'M CONSERVATION BASED ON PS ON THAT ARE WITH EMBEDDED WITH NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES AND SO WE'RE SAYING. UNEQUIVOCALLY AND BELIEVE ME THERE'S PEOPLE WHO AGREE WITH US MOST PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH PASSED SOME LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY NOW COMMUNITY ONLY ONE ACCOUNT THE 9% NOT ALL SIXTEEN PERCENT. BY THAT SIXTEEN PERCENT OF WATERS IS. A STATE MARINE PROTECTED AREA AND SO WE'RE SAYING OKAY THAT'S OUR BASELINE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE STARTING. ON AND SO A LOT OF THOSE MPAS ARE ARE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE NOW MEANS. WHAT WERE THIS PATHWAY PER. IS DISCUSS ON NEED TO DEAL WITH AND THEN AFTER MEANS SANCTUARIES PROVIDE A LEVEL OF CONSERVATION THAT MEETS IS WE JUST HAD THIS DISCUSSION ON THE DEFINITIONS. ON AND ACTUALLY MEET THE SPIRIT OF THE DEFINITION BOTH UNDER ABILITY IN BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION SO THAT'S- RIGHT THAT'S THE DISTINCTION ON THERE IS THAT IT IS MAY I AM CANCER BATTED WITH SANCTUARY. RIGHT NOW ALL OF THE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS ARE. INCLUDED CORRECT. OKAY YEAH RIGHT THANK THERE'S THIS ON THE PUBLIC WAY THERE'S A LOT OF FOR THAT THAT'S SO STAY IN OUR A POSITION AS A RIGHT NOW AND I JUST WANNA GARNER IN TERMS OF HOW BOUT THEY HAVE BEEN FOR THE FISHING ACTUALLY OF BECAUSE OF THE- THE AMOUNT OF BIODIVERSITY IN AND THE AMOUNT OF FISH POPULATION THAT'S COMING OUT OF THOSE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISS GARCIA. PAT THANK YOU I DR NORRIS LET ME TAKE A SO A LITTLE BIT FROM THE MARINE FIGHTER AND- THE NATIONAL FOREST AND GREAT PARKS LIKE YOSEMITE TO LIMPING A PICTURE. OF HIS IN YOUR PRESENTATION IN THE DISCUSSION SO FAR I DON'T I DON'T HAVE CLARITY FOR URBAN AREAS LIKE I LIVE IN A HAVE CONSTITUENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WANT TO BE PART OF THIS THIRTY BY THIRTY DISCUSSION AND HAVE BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS. AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET CREATIVE BUT WE'VE BEEN HITTING WALLS- BUT I LIVE IN A VERY LANDLOCKED- URBAN VERY DENSE WANTED THAT. OF THE- IN STATE ACTUALLY OUT THERE AND- IT NOT CLEAR HOW WE PARTICIPATE ARE HOW WE HELP GET TO THAT SIX MILLION ACRE ALSO VERY PARK POOR AN EXAMPLE I HAVE. THE GREEN WAY IT'S A WAY THAT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE OF MY DISTRICT- THREE SOME WITH YOUR AND TOWARDS ORANGE COUNTY AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT INVESTMENT FOR THAT COMMUNITY. AND IF YOU CROSS THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER TO THEIR SIDE THERE'S- OF INTERCOM WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT GREEN WE CONNECTED THAT CONCRETE AND HAD WE TREAT THAT TO BE A MORE OPEN. GREEN OPEN SPACES I SEE A RIVER THAT'S BEEN. POURED OVER WITH CONCRETE. ALONG THE WAY ABOVE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANSWERS ABOUT HOW WE DO THAT WE HAVE A PIECE OF LAND THAT WE THINK WE COULD ACQUIRE. ART AND THAT WE THINK WOULD BE THAT PERFECT CONNECTOR BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT WE QUALIFIER WE CAN. TAKE OVER A BE PART OF THIS THIRTY BY THIRTY WHEN WE THINK OF THIRTY BY THIRTY WE THINK OF THAT AND THAT. THAT CREATIVE THERE CAN YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FROM DISCUSSIONS YOU HAD FROM DEATH AND- HOW AND IN SPACE CAN TO THIS SIX MILLION ACRE THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU SOME. FOR THAT QUESTION THAT'S SUCH IMPORTANT. OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- FOR SMALLER SAY THAT THE CAR. WE'VE HAD AROUND STATE IT'S BEEN REMARKABLE HOW MANY PLACES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS OPPORTUNITIES TO. HELP US MEET THE GOALS I'M THINK SPUR. IN URBAN AREAS. LARGE ACRE BROWNFIELD COULD BE RESTORED AND TURNED INTO- THRIVING BIODIVERSITY AREAS THAT ALSO PROVIDE ACCESS AND I'VE SEEN THAT THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THAT'S VERY EXCITING- BUT ALSO I WANT TO REMIND. EVERYONE THAT YOU KNOW THIRTY BY THIRTY IS DEFINITELY NOT. ALL CONSERVATION IN CALIFORNIA NOR IS IT INTENDED TO MEET ALL OF OUR- OUTDOOR ACCESS PRIORITIES WHICH IS WHY THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS LAUNCHED THE OUTDOORS FOR ALL INITIATIVE SO WITHIN CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY WE ARE EMBARKING ON A YEAR LONG CONVERSATION. ON HOW TO ENSURE THERE IS ACCESS FOR ALL TO PUT AN END IN OUTDOOR OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL YOU KNOW AS AS THE COVERED CRISIS IDENTIFIED FOR US SO MANY CALIFORNIANS HAD NO ACCESS TO GREEN SPACE. THAT'S AN ISSUE WE WANT TO REMEDY AND SO THE OUTER FOR ALL INITIATIVES DESIGNED INTENTIONALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE PARKS. AND HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO GET OUTSIDE AND ENJOY GREEN SPACES SO THOSE THESE TWO PIECES GO TOGETHER. THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THERE ARE PLACES WHERE CAN REALLY DO REAL IN. REST I'M I'M LOOKING AT. ABOUT COASTAL WETLANDS AND ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES THERE TO PROMOTE CLIMATE RESILIENCE GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO THE COAST AND ALSO- PROVIDE FOR OUR BIODIVERSITY MANY OF THOSE ARE CLOSE TO URBAN AREAS. SO WE SEE ALL THESE LITTLE PIECES FITTING TOGETHER BUT THEY DON'T ALL- THEY'RE ALL COMPLETELY OVERLAP IT'S A IT'S A VENN DIAGRAM. KICKED SOMETHING DOCTOR THERE PLEASE. ON THE- YOU KNOW NO. KNOW YOUR THIS I THINK INCLUDED SO GABRIEL WATERS. IN AND JOHN. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY AND NORMA STAFFORD'S ON AN NECKLACE AT- OVER THE DECK. I'M AYE AYE THIS ISSUE AND IN THIS IS AN ERROR THAT- DOCTOR NINTH ABOUT A LOT IS THAT. YOU KNOW THAT URBAN PARKS AND CONNECTIVITY ON TO THE WILD LANDS ON I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE DEFINITELY. EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT MOVING FORWARD ON IN IN THAT REALIZING THAT ON IT OF THAT CONNECTIVITY ON RIVER RESTORATION AND WETLANDS ALONGSIDE THE RIVER AND AN OPEN SPACE ALONGSIDE THE RIVER BUT ALSO MORE INTERNALLY. IF THERE'S DEMONSTRATE. BOMB WHILE I CORD OR CAN. ON IT AND THERE'S SOME PERMANENT TO IT ON AND IT'S A LARGE ENOUGH SIZE THAT'S OF BIODIVERSITY BENEFIT I MEAN WE SHOULD WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATIONS IT'S JUST. LOS ANGELES IN PARTICULAR IS SUCH A UNIQUE SITUATION BECAUSE THE INCREDIBLE BIODIVERSITY THERE SAN DIEGO ITSELF FALLS INTO THIS CATEGORY AS WELL BOND AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. ON IT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE NEXUS BETWEEN DOUBTS AS AS DR NORTH OF PRODUCT I IT'S I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. IN FOR SO I WITH ARE ALL PART OF THERE SO I COULD FOLLOW UP TO THE AND I'M TALKING ABOUT IS ACTUALLY NEXT TO THIS AND GAVE OVER A BED- AND I'LL I I'M WHICH BETWEEN THE SINGER WILL IN THE L. A. RIVER BETH TO CONCRETE MY LET ME LET ME SAY THAT EVERY TIME WE USE THE WORD RIVER YOU GET TO CONCRETE MONSTERS OF EVER ANYMORE AND IF THERE'S WATER TO THE IT'S BEEN THIS TRIED AND SEWER SYSTEMS MY AREA- BUT THAT IS OUR BIODIVERSITY AND WE NEED TO GO BACK TO RESTORING THE SPACES AND WE THINK ABOUT THIRTY BY THIRTY. THOSE ARE THE SPACES THAT WE LIVE WITH AND WHEN YOU SAY ABOUT A LOT OF SPACE WHAT IS THAT MARGIN OF SPACE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THAT'S NOT REALISTIC IN ONE OF THE DENSEST. AREAS OF CALIFORNIA LET YOU KNOW SPACE MIGHT ONLY BE A HALF AN ACRE. I AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MANY MANY A OR AS WELL MANY MANY ACRES. THAT WAY THAT'S COUNTRY. AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S ONE TALK ABOUT THESE. THAT ARE REALLY A AND I CAN SERVICE TO EXCITED ABOUT IT THE TRANSFER OUT HOW TO A PART OF IT WE GET TOLD ALEXI NOT MAYBE MAYBE LATER ON WITH THIS OTHER PROJECT IT'S ALWAYS LATER ON AND NEVER TRICKLE SAID. AND THAT'S WHEN THE FEELING LIKE THIS IS TRUE DOWN ENVIRONMENT- WHICH HAS BY THE COUNTIES ON PURPOSE AND SO I HAVE A LACK OF IMPATIENCE IT'S BEEN ALL MY LIFE- AND I LITERALLY HAVE TO MAKE THE CHOICE OF DO I QUITE ON THE RIVER BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY PARALLEL TO THE FREEWAY THAT MOVES ALL THE GETS MOMENTS FROM THE PORT TO THE REALLY GREAT. MY DISTRICT AND HOW HEALTHY IS THAT LITTLE TREE BUFFER SOME WEIGHT MIGHT BE YOU KNOW APPRECIATED AS WELL. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE MY FRUSTRATIONS COMING I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM BUT- THE SIMPLE FIGURE IT OUT OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT DOESN'T ALWAYS SEEM TO CATCH UP IN MY COMMUNITY. MR ALL RANDOM MESSAGE GRATEFUL THAT MEMBER GARCIA FOR REFER RAISING AN ISSUE THAT REALLY EVEN IN THE ORIGINAL THIRTY THIRTIES ARE AS AS I WROTE IT THERE WAS A DUAL PURPOSE ONE IS TO PROTECT PLAN WHAT ARE THE OTHER ONE WAS ACCESS AND AN EQUITY AS WELL- AND I HAVE MY BILL THIS YEAR AB THIRTY- WHICH FOCUSES ON- ENVIRONMENT IT THE OUTDOOR. TO NATURE AND I THINK IT REALLY BLENDS WELL WITH THE COMMENTS THAT COULD THAT- ASSEMBLY GARCIA THESE LAW PRIDE IN AREAS BECAUSE BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES AND- COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE AND CERTAINLY IN SUMMER GARCIA'S WERE B. THAT WEATHER IS OPPORTUNITY. TO CREATE SPACES AND TO CREATE- IN ABOUT TO CREATE. FOR ACCESS- TO OPEN SPACE- AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE- ISN'T NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO WAIT ON IF I HAVE ANOTHER BILL PUT UP FOR POCKET FOURS. YOUR NEED THIRTY FEET BY THIRTY FEET TO CREATE A PROBLEM FOR US WAS EXTREMELY- BENEFITS FOR BIODIVERSITY INCREASING GREEN SPACES. AS WELL- AS I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT AS A AS A GENERAL COMMENT THAT THAT- IS NOT A NICE TO HAVE IT'S A MUST HAVE THAT WE CREATE ACCESS AND CREATE. EQUITY IN TERMS OF OUR PROGRAMS CREATING- OF THAT MEETING THESE GOALS OPEN SPACE AND WATER- PROTECTING OUR WATER AS WELL- IN A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IS ONE EIGHT ONE IS REGARDING FUNDING I'M ALSO IS. GRATEFUL FOR THE- MILLION DOLLAR SUPPORT TRAVEL ENTITIES OF THINGS WOULD BE CRITICAL THOSE PARTNERSHIPS IF YOU WANT TO MEET THESE GOALS IN A MEANINGFUL MANNER- AND- A QUESTION REGARDING I GUESS WHAT OTHER MEANINGFUL WAYS IS IT ADMINISTRATION. OFFERING TO OTHER KIND OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO MEET SOME OF THESE GOALS AND THE LARGER ISSUE OF- JUST. IN GENERAL IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR ACQUISITION RESTORATION MANAGEMENT SO IT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF MONEY AS OPPOSED TO ADMINISTRATION PLAN. PROVIDED FUNDING OVER THE LONG TERM IN WORKING OBVIOUSLY BUT. THE LEGISLATURE. WELL THE A THAT'S A I'M NOT. FULLY READY TO ANSWER I WILL SAY YOU KNOW IT'S CLEAR IN OUR DOCUMENT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S NOT ALL OF THE FUNDING IS GOING TO COME FROM THE STATE RIGHT SOME OF THIS IS WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND AS  POINTED OUT- WHEN I WENT THROUGH THEPATHWAYS. THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF CONSERVATION THAT'S HAPPENING NOW FROM. TO YOUR PROJECTS AND EVEN SMALL PROJECTS THAT ISN'T BEING DONE IN A STRATEGIC WAY SO WE CAN ACTUALLY LEVERAGE EXISTING MONEY AND USE IT TO SUPPORT THIRTY BY THIRTY MORE EFFECTIVELY. SO I THINK THERE'S A SUITE OF APPROACHES THAT ARE GOING TO GET US THERE- BUT OBVIOUSLY. IT'S A LONG TERM COMMITMENT AND I'M NOT YOU KNOW YOU ASKED A BIT ABOUT WORKING WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND WHAT THE MINISTRATIONS DOING I MEAN WE THINK THAT'S THAT'S CENTRAL TO- MAKING THIS WORK. AND PART OF WHAT YOU'LL SEE AS WE ROLL OUT OUR PROPOSAL- FOR THAT NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS SET ASIDE. BUT YOU KNOW THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRIBES WE THOUGHT WAS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT DOWN PAYMENT IN THAT DIRECTION. YEAH I AGREE I THINK THAT THERE'S- THE PARTNERSHIP ASPECT IS GOING TO HAPPEN COME WITH RESOURCES. THAT HELP TO LEVERAGE THE- STATE FUNDS WHETHER IT'S LIKE YOU BE IN OUR AREA THEY OPEN. OR OR THERE ARE TRUSTS THAT. WITH WITH LOT OF BANG FOR THEIR BUCK AS WELL AS- TAKING BAGS OF THE STATE RESOURCES. AND THE- THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE. IS REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION OF THIRTY THIRTY. OF OVER THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS AND- HOW WE ENSURE THAT FUTURE GOVERNMENTS WILL CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS- NOT ONLY FOR THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS UNTIL THEY'RE TWENTY THIRTY AND BEYOND. YOU KNOW I I'M I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE- THE FOUNDATION OF THE DISEASE ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET THIS DROP I MEAN THE AMOUNT OF. EXCITEMENT THAT I SEE TALKING TO PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE AND YOU KNOW THERE BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME POLLING THAT 70% OF CALIFORNIANS THINK THAT MORE CONSERVATION IS A GREAT IDEA. AND ARE EXCITED TO SEE THIRTY BY THIRTY CONTINUES- I'M HOPEFUL THIS MOVEMENT HAS POWER WEBI- ME CERTAIN. THOUGHT I HOPE SO AS WELL AND I COMMEND YOU ON THE GO THE MINISTRATION FROM REALLY MAKING THIS A PRIORITY. WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE OR IN DOING THAT- YOU KNOW I HAVE OTHER LEGISLATION REGARDING CODIFYING SOME OF THESE GOALS BECAUSE I THINK ULTIMATELY. YOU JUST CAN'T MISS WE COUNT ON THE FACT THE NEXT GOVERNOR IS GOING TO BE. I HAVE THE SAME MINDSET OF GOVERNORS ADAM PRIORITIES AND THAT'S FINE BUT I THINK IT'S A- THINK WE'RE- WE SHOWN A- WITH THE GUY. WITHIN AS OF THIS I THINK VERY PRODUCTIVE THAT I THINK WE SHOULD. TAKE THE STEPS TO MAKE IT STAND THE TEST OF TIME SO TO SPEAK THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA MISTER MERRETT SAID SHE RESPECTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IF I CAN DIRECTOR CALL. TO THE GOLD. MR GOLD. OUR OUR YOU FAMILIAR THE REDONDO COSTA WELL. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE AT THE POWER PLANT YES. YES I AM FAMILIAR OKAY- SO. IF THE COMMUNITY WANTED TO ABOUT. TRYING TO HAVE. THAT A LAND DESIGNATED AS PART OF YOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE COASTAL WETLAND RESTORATION EFFORT HATTON HOW DO WE THAT. I THINK I HAVE THAT MEETING WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE NEXT NEXT WEEK IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN I'M IT'S CALM BY EIGHTY KNOW I KNOW HAS BEEN DIFFICULT OKAY. LEVEL ON AS WELL ON AND- IT SO I WOULD BACK WITH A BETTER ANSWER TO YOU. AFTER THAT MEETING- BUT IF IT INCLUDES MEETING WITH THE MAYOR FIVE I THINK BRAND STILL AMERICA WE BEACH AND OTHERS OF THAT ON BUT IT'S- ON DEFINITELY CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THEY'RE IN THEY'RE MEETING SCHEDULED- FOR FURTHER. DISCUSSION MARK. I THANK YOU BUT BUT- THAT'S A NEW. OF THE OF THE OF CULTURE THAT WOULD FIT INTO. THE THIRTY BY THIRTY INITIATIVE YES ON IT SO IT TO BE A CANDIDATE IT'S A LITTLE SMALL SO IT DEPENDS HOW LARGE THE WETLAND CREATION AND RESTORATION IS. ON IF YOU LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW AND J. SOMEWHAT WHEN BUT- HAVE NOT BEEN WORST LIKE LOST THREE. AND BY ALL AYE AND- YOU KNOW OUR MOM BEACH IN VENTURA- THERE'S A LOT MORE- BIODIVERSITY. ON AT THOSE BUT THAT DOES MEAN ON AS I IF I CAN'T ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA MADE A VERY POWERFUL POINT ON THAT SMALLER PROJECTS. AREN'T IMPORTANT TO. THIS FARMER COMPONENT NEED TO BE FOR SHORT. OKAY YOU- I A QUESTION I'M NOT OF FOR DOCTOR GOLDER DOC NORRIS DISTRICT THE PALACE VERDES- OPEN SPACE- I IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT IS OWNED BY THE CITY RANCHO PALLETS FOR DAYS BUT THAT ALSO BE AN EXAMPLE OF A CANDIDATE FOR THE THIRTY BY THIRTY INITIAL. I PLEADING AND NOT KNOWING THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION I THINK I THINK THAT REALLY IS THE POINT OF IT IF IT'S AN OPEN SPACE THAT IS BEING MANAGED FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES AND- THE DEFINITION. I'M ASSUMING DR NOR. AND I WOULD THAT THAT WOULD COUNT JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT. HOW HOW IT'S BEING MANAGED AT THIS POINT ON IT IN THAT MANNER. AND IN TERMS OF THE DISCUSSION EARLIER ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF- THE THEIR REGIONAL PARTNERS THE REGIONAL COALITIONS- WHO WHO WHO ARE THE THAT- THAT I NEED TO REACH OUT TO- AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AREA. I SO I'M GONNA TRY TO JUMP IN HERE THROUGH THE COURSE OF OUR ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT THERE WERE THERE WERE REGIONAL COALITIONS THAT SORT OF SPRING UP TO PARTICIPATE IN THIRTY BY THIRTY AND SENT IN LETTERS I COULD GO BACK AND LOOK AND SEE WHO THOSE PARTICULAR PEOPLE WORK- BUT AT THE SAME TIME. I'M TALKING MORE BROADLY LIKE THERE'S THOSE KINDS OF GROUPS THAT GATHER TOGETHER AND SAID WE WANT TO BE PART OF THIRTY BY THIRTY AS WELL AS YOU KNOW BY WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED YOU KNOW LIKE THAT SAN DIEGO MULTI SPECIES CONSERVATION PLANNING GROUPS OF THAT SORT SO. IT REALLY CAN BE ANY ANY ONE OF THOSE AT. MY I MIGHT TAKE A MOMENT JUST TO- TO DO A LITTLE MORE. ABOUT OF THIS WHAT COUNTS AND DOESN'T. THERE'S NOT SOME YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW MARK HOLDEN AYE I JOKE SOMETIMES I'M NOT SITTING THERE WITH A CLIPBOARD ON WHICH PROJECTS ARE IN IN WHICH PROJECTS ARE OUT WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN USING EXISTING PROGRAMS OF EXISTING. APPROACHES TO GETTING THIS CONSERVE DONE SO ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE TRIED AND TRUE THAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT- WHETHER IT'S- PROTECTING AREAS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED THROUGH ESTABLISHING A REFUGE PUTTING INTO CONSERVATION EASEMENT ON FOR YOU KNOW. CONSERVATION WE WANT TO USE THE EXISTING PROPHECIES THAT HAVE THEIR OWN CRITERIA AND THEIR OWN APPROACHES HOW TO GET THIS WORK DONE SO THEY'RE NOT SORT OF A SEPARATE. A LEDGER THAT WE USE TO EVALUATE THESE PROJECTS WE WANT TO. WE WANT TO USE THE THINGS THAT WE ALL ALREADY KNOW AND UNDERSTAND. I RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK THE DOLLAR DID YOU YEAH. FIFTY SO THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR SAY- I READ A VERY VERY DIFFERENT- GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAN MOST OF THE MEMBERS TO ME BIGELOW AND I HAVE SIMILAR- WE'RE ALSO FARMERS SO WE HAVE WIDE OPEN SPACE THAT WE WILL NEVER BUILD ON THERE'S NO INTENT SO I GET THE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE COMING FROM MY CONSTITUENTS AND THE OPEN LANDS ALREADY EXISTS THERE. SO YOUR TIME OUT WORKING WITH EXISTING PROGRAM SO WITH THE INTENT TO INCLUDE A PROGRAM LIKE THE WILLIAMSON ACT BE INCLUDED AND A FOLLOW UP QUICK YOU ALSO SPOKE ABOUT GRAZED AND- RANGELAND I'M I'M WONDERING IF THAT IS ALSO INCLUDED. YES SO AND I IS ONE EXAMPLE YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE ARE SHE TERM TEN YEARS RIGHT THIS MY UNDERSTANDING BUT I RECENTLY LEARNED THERE'S TO WILLIAMSON ACT BECAUSE LONGER SO THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING WITH OUR PARTNERS THAT- THAT YOU MISTER THOSE PROGRAMS ABOUT SORT OF HOW DO WE- GET. THE DURABILITY- OF THAT SORT OF PROGRAM REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE PART OF THIRTY BY THIRTY THOUGH YOU KNOW THEY'RE STILL A REALLY IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT REGARDLESS OF THIRTY BY THIRTY- BUT- IT WITH REGARD TO GRAZING IN PARTICULAR YOU KNOW I MIGHT. MIGHT CAREER EXPERIENCE THERE ARE MANY MANY BEAUTIFUL INCREDIBLE RANCHES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SPECIFICALLY I'M THINKING OF THAT ARE UNDER CONSERVATION EASEMENT THAT ARE PROTECTING- VERNAL LANDSCAPES THROUGH GRAZING. ACTIVITY THROUGH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THOSE ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE KINDS OF PLACES THAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THROUGH THIS. THROUGH THIRTY BY THIRTY. SO DOES DO COUNT IN MY- IN AND THEY'RE PART OF OUR- DEFINITIONS WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOW UP ON THE MAP IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE BUT- WE THINK THERE'S YOU KNOW A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND POTENTIALLY- EASEMENT PROPERTIES OUT THERE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE IN OUR DATABASE BUT THEY ABSOLUTELY MEET OUR. DEFINITION SO HOW DID THEY GET INTO THE DATA. WE HAVE PUT OUT A CALL WE HAVE LITERALLY HONORED BECAUSE I SAID IF YOU WANT TO GET ON OUR MAPS LET US KNOW AND PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY SENDING IN US INFORMATION SO WE CAN ADD THEM TO THE DATA SO IT'S HAPPENING ALREADY. OKAY SO. PREDICTIONS WHEN. DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT HAVE REPRESENT- OF FOLK IN PARTICULAR INPUT OUT THE CALL. SO THANK YOU. AT Y. WORCESTER JUST FAITH THE MEMBERS FOR THEIR DEEP ENGAGEMENT TODAY ON THIS AND FOR BOTH OF YOU FOR HERE TO PRESENT ON THIS IMPORT TOPIC AND I WANNA COMMEND YOU FOR GOING FURTHER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I KNOW THAT WAS A HOT TOPIC BUT I THINK THEY CAN- DOESN'T JUST LET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SET THE TONE WE DECIDE FOR OURSELVES WHAT COUNTS AND I THINK THAT'S THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE BY YOU AND YOUR- TEAM AND I WANT TO COME YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT BIODIVERSITY IS SOMETHING THAT FOR TOO LONG HAS NOT BEEN AT THE- CENTER OF CONVERSATIONS AND IT'S SO CRITICAL. AND THE MORE WORK WE DO THE BETTER OFF AND CALIFORNIA WILL BE IN THE FUTURE SO. I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE WORK ON THIS- AND THAT SORT OF. INTO MY FIRST QUESTION WHICH IS SIX. ACRES IN EIGHT YEARS WHICH- IS A LOT. AND DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY ACRES PER YEAR WE'VE BEEN CONSERVING TO DATE. HOW WE'RE GONNA. I ASSUME WE NEED TO ACCELERATE THAT. SIGNIFICANTLY I KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE MONEY YOU'RE DISCUSSING WILL BE A PORTION OF THAT BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF LOCAL SIX MILLION ACRES AND- THE NEXT. SECTION SIX. YEAH I MEAN IT IT DOES SOUND LIKE A LOT OF IT IS A LOT- I DON'T HAVE A RATE PER YEAR AND I THINK IN CALIFORNIA ARE CONSERVATION PROBABLY GOES IN WAVES RIGHT WE GET THESE BIG BONDS AND GRANTS AND PUT. THE A BUNCH AND THEN IT ECONOMY SORT OF PUT IT THE BACK BURNER- I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE HAS BEEN- THROUGH THIS. CALIFORNIA BY DIVERSITY COUNCIL- WE ACTUALLY PUT OUT A CALL TO ALL THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES WITHIN THE COUNCIL AND ASK THEM FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY ADMINISTER THAT ARE GOING TO HELP MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THIRTY BY THIRTY. AND THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE AN APPENDIX TO THE PATHWAYS REPORT. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE A- NOT EVERY PROGRAM BUT SORT OF THE TOP FIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO MAKE A PUT OUT OF WE DID A SURVEY AND THAT SURVEY WE ASKED YOU KNOW HOW MANY ACRES DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GET. WITH THIS PROGRAM THIS YEAR AND IN COMING YEARS YOU KNOW UNDER AT LEAST THIS BY THE THAT EFFORT I DID A VERY GROSS DON'T ASK ME FOR THE DETAILS BACK OF THE ENVELOPE CALCULATION. AND I THINK WE'RE REALLY ON THE PATH AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE THIS PARTNERSHIP AND WE DRIVE ON THESE VERY. DIFFERENT APPROACHES SO IT'S NOT ALL JUST. ACQUIRING LAND THROUGH THE NOTES STATE COPPERS BUT THERE'S A DESK IT IS AMBITIOUS BUT ALSO VERY DOABLE. AND THEN ONCE REQUIRE ALL THIS LAND I THIS TO. OF THIS LAND AND I WANNA AT. JOIN THE CHORUS OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE COMMENDING YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR NATIVE PEOPLE BECAUSE I THINK THEY'VE BEEN. INCREDIBLE STORIES OF OUR LAND WELL WE HAVE GOT HERE- BUT AS WE ACQUIRE THIS LAND OBVIOUSLY THE ON GOING STEWARDSHIP OF THIS LAND IS REALLY CRITICAL WORK WE HAVE. BEEN OUR WILDFIRE PROBLEM IS IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN MAINTAINING OUR LANDS AS WE SHOULD HAVE. SO I GUESS PART OF MY QUESTION IS OKAY WE HAVE THIS GREAT GOAL WE'RE GOING TO GET THEIR WHAT IS OUR PLAN TO THEN. BE PROPER STEWARDS OF ALL OF THIS LANDS. IN PERPETUITY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS WAS A VERY HOT TOPIC IN OUR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT. BECAUSE WE HAVE A GREAT TRACK RECORD OF. GETTING LAND UNDER CONSERVATION AND THEN NOT ALWAYS PARK. TAKING CARE OF IT THE WAY WE SHOULD AND NOT INVESTING IN THAT STEWARDSHIP AND SO I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE THAT THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT- YOU KNOW. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT PRIVATE LAND EASEMENTS YOU KNOW. WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THOSE IS THAT. THE MANAGEMENT IS ACTUALLY BUILT INTO THE WAY THAT THE LAND IS CONSERVED AND SO THOSE ARE GREAT EXAMPLES OF WHERE IT'S WORKING WELL I THINK- WE NEED TO UP OUR GAME FIRST EVER CHECK ON A LOT OF OUR- ARE ALREADY CONSERVE PLANS AND BUILD THAT INTO THE PROCESS. I DON'T HAVE AN EASY ANSWER FOR YOU BUT I. CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL PIECE. I AGREE THANK YOU LET'S KEEP OUR EYE ON THAT BECAUSE LASSEN ON DO IS CREATE A- BIG MESSING CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY STRUCK ME IN IN READING YOU KNOW THE MATERIALS AROUND THIRTY BY THIRTY WAS HOW POORLY WE'RE DOING ON WETLANDS THAT WE LOST WHOLE HOST OF REASONS- AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE. YOU KNOW I DON'T LIVE IN AN AREA WITH MUCH- BUT- IT SEEMS LIKE THAT NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY IN THIS- IS REALLY WHERE HAVE WE TAKEN THE BIGGEST HIT I THINK THIS GOES A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT. MR BIGELOW WAS FOCUSING ON AND WHERE HAVE WE REACHED OUR GOALS WERE HAVEN'T WE AND I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTION SHOULD BE WHERE WE STRUGGLING THE MOST. IN TERMS OF BY. AND I WOULD THINK FROM THE READ MY READING THAT THAT WOULD BE WETLANDS IS THERE PRIOR. IN THAT REGARD. CLINTON I THINK ANY NOT TELLING YOU. THE WHOLE STORY I MEAN WE KNOW THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEREVER WE ARE SOME YES LIKE THAT. THAT'S A CRITICAL THING IN EVERY ECOSYSTEM IS MAKING SURE THAT THE WETLANDS OR THE FRESH WATER THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THEM OR THE BRACKISH WATER. IS PROTECTED- SO IN THE IN THE DOCUMENT WE IDENTIFY- SORT OF. OUR PRINCIPLES FOR MEETING OUR ABOUT PRIORITIES I SHOULD SAY. AND IN THAT WE IDENTIFIED UNDER REPRESENTED ECOSYSTEMS AS KEY. AND IT OR PLACES THAT ARE ALREADY VERY RARE OR DEGRADED AND YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY THERE'S A SUITE OF OTHER. SYSTEMS AND BLUE OAK WOODLANDS COMES TO MIND THAT ARE ACTUALLY REALLY DOWN TO A VERY. SMALL PROPORTION OF WHAT WE HAD IN THE PAST- WE- WANT TO DO A DEEPER. DIVE INTO ANALYZING WHERE WE HAVE PROTECTED AREAS USING THAT CA NATURE GIS THAT I MENTIONED. TO REALLY LOOK AT WHERE DO WE HAVE NEEDS ACROSS THE ECOSYSTEMS OF CALIFORNIA AND WHERE CAN WE INVEST IN TO. MAKE SURE WE'RE MEETING OUR BIODIVERSITY GOALS. SO THAT'S- WORK TO CALM AND CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING. I MENTIONED THE CALIFORNIA BIODIVERSITY NETWORK THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A ROUND TABLE THAT'S- DESIGNER. THAT CONVERSATION NO WHERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT- PATTERSON PROTECTIONS THAT WE SHOULD. REALLY BE DIGGING INTO. THANK I WOULD ALSO. I WOULD ALSO ADD ON THE COASTAL. SIDE IT'S BEEN A- VERY. BIG PRIORITY IN THE OCEAN WHAT WHEN A CAR. ON YOU SEE INVEST. THAT DR NO PUT OUT THERE BY HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. ON CLOSER AS- NATURE. SOLUTIONS A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE THE WETLAND. ON AND LIVING SHORELINE HABITAT BOTH OF WHICH ARE. ON THERE'S SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT NEEDS THEY ARE DOING HABITAT AND IT'S REALLY. WIPED OUT ALMOST BADLY AS- CONSEQUENCE IN THE STATE. I'M SO THE PRIORITIES THERE. THERE'S SOME FIND BEING AND I CAN TELL YOU BEST OR READ FOR. ALSO INTO ACCOUNT THE LIKE SEQUESTERING. AND RIGHTS- ALSO IT IS A VERY BIG PART THIS AS WELL NOT ABOUT HER SEASIDE. THANK YOU IN. I'M NOT GONNA DR WILL HAVE YOU EVER QUESTIONS ON OUR OF MARIE PROTECTED. AND SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN THE PLAN WE WENT THROUGH A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH ABOUT. FEDERER'S REJECT AREAS I REALLY APPRECIATED WHAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT ONLY. FOCUSING ON THOSE AREAS THAT ARE TRULY PROTECTING THE BIODIVERSITY OF OUR OCEANS BUT THEN YOU ALSO AID THAT BECAUSE OF THAT REVIEW WE'RE NOT. GOING TO INCLUDE IN THIS INITIAL PLAN ADDITIONAL MARINE PROTECTED AREAS. I'M JUST CALLING ON IT UNDERNEATH AND YOU. THAT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S IT'S BEEN DARN JARGON HIM SO I PLEDGE I FOR ALL THAT. I'M THE ON THE- SIDE WE TALK ABOUT NATIONALLY SANCTION. RIGHT AND THEN ON THIS. SIDE WE MARIE PER STATE MARIE PROTECTED AREAS ALL COUNT. SO THE ALL HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR ABOUT I UNDERSTAND I'M NOT SAYING WHAT COUNTS ANYTHING TO GET HER GOAL WHICH WE ARE FURTHER ON IN OCEANS WE MORE WORK TO DO IN OUR OCEANS RIGHT. YOU SAID BECAUSE IT A REVIEW I THINK BECAUSE OUR ON GOING REVIEW OF OUR MARINE PROTECTED AREAS IN THE INITIAL PLAN THAT WILL COME OUT IN THE COMING MONTHS I BELIEVE. YOU WILL NOT BE DDING ADDITIONAL MORNING PROTECTED AREAS ALL. EXPLAINED HOW HE EVER GET TO COSTA WATER PROTECTION WITHOUT THAT. THREE THREE. THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD POINT AND HERE'S WHY. ON WHICH IS. A LOT OF THIS IS A RESPECT PROCESS ON ISSUE WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR THIRTY BY THIRTY CAME OUT- OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD THE MARINE LIFE PROTECTION ACT. AND THE NETWORK OF MPAS WAS CREATED AND MANAGED BY TWENTY TWELVE- I'M ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS WAS TO PUT TOGETHER AND THE CABLE MANAGEMENT RUBIO. I'M AT THAT TIME. I'M THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF FINDING INVESTED INTO DOING ON SCIENCE TO ASSESS. WHAT THE APPETITE SEE AN IMPACTS OF THAT NETWORK IT HAS SPENT A LOT OF THE SCIENCES- HAS JUST BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE LAST. LAST MONTH IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT- SO IT'S OUT THERE- SO THIS FINAL REPORT. ASSESSING I'M THE EFFICACY OF ON. THE EMPTY AND OUR OVER THE DECADE WILL COME OUT AT THE- FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND SO MIGHT WAS JUST. BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY STAKEHOLDERS ON ALL SIDES BUT THEIR CONSERVATION OR IN AS WELL AS THE FISHING ARENA AND BELIEVE ME. SPORTFISHING A LOT DIFFERENT THAN COMMERCIAL FISHING ON INTEREST THERE. ON WE SAID IF I'M THIRTY BY FOR AS WE WEREN'T GOING TO JUMP AHEAD TO MAKE A DETERMINATION ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO. ON BY EXPANDING THE MPA NETWORK INTEL ALL THE SCIENCE AND THE ASSESSMENT IS AND SO IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT AS A MATTER OF FACT IT'S ONLY A YEAR AWAY. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WHAT WE CAN START HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT WE MADE A PROMISE TO THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY THAT WE WERE GOING TO POLITICIZE. ON A DETAIL MAN REVIEW IN THAT MANNER AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE MADE THAT WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE PRUDENT DECISION AT THIS TIME. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT CAN'T AND WON'T COME UP SUBSEQUENT TO THE COMPLETION. THAT TICKET A MANAGEMENT REVIEW. GOT IT WELL I WAS I THINK BASED ON OUR CALL. TODAY IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET TO PROTECTING THOSE COASTAL WATERS IS ADDITIONAL ON PS I HOPE IT'LL- BE ON THE TABLE SOON CRIPPLE OUT OF WORK TO DO THERE. OBVIOUSLY AND ON THAT. I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD FROM OUR FISHING COMMUNITIES ON THE S. AS WE LOOK TO EXPAND PROTECTIONS OFF THE COAST- THE IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE ON. THEM IN THE FOOD RESOURCE THEY PROVIDE WHAT IS THE MESSAGE TO OUR FISHERIES ON WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. ON THE MESSAGE TO THEM IS THAT WE NEED TO WORK WITH YOU TO FINISH. FINISH THE JOB ON HOW WE GET THE THIRTY BY THIRTY ON AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW THERE. SUCH CRITICAL STATE. IN THIS ENTIRE THING. ON AND JOHN AND SO THERE WILL BE EVEN MORE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED. ARE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT GOING ON THAT THAT'S CONCERNING IN THE FISHERIES. SORT THINK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. GET THE CABLE MANAGEMENT RUBIO. YOU'VE GOT- CONCERNS NOT JUST FIVE PASSED ME IN REGARDS TO. THAT G. MMASHARE NATIONAL SANCTUARY WITH THE VISION. EXPRESSED CONCERNS THEY ARE. ON THERE'S CONCERNS.

REALLY WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPEN AND WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE PARTNERING YOU HEARD FROM CALL. TODAY YOU KNOW WHO FEEL FRUSTRATION THAT THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN SO HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO BE A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION TO MAKE SURE. THAT ALL THE CONSTITUENCIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE BEING HEARD AND INCLUDED IN THIS. WELL I THINK HAVING HEARINGS THIS A REAL. HELPFUL TO HAVE THIS COME. IS A WEEK. AIR BASED. AND WE CAN HEAR WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR DISTRICTS. WE ARE TRYING HARD TO MEET AND MEET WITH. PEOPLE ALL OVER THE STATE BUT YOU HAVE THAT CONNECTION AND SO. ANYTIME THAT WE CAN GET TOGETHER IN DIALOGUE I THINK IS REALLY REALLY VALUABLE AND I JUST. ALSO WANT OF.

TREMENDOUS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO MORE WORK LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE. AWESOME WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR ENGAGEMENT IN ANSWERING ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS EVEN WHEN WE- HAVE HAD ASKED. BECAUSE OF OUR CONFUSION SAID. ISN'T IT IT'S CONFUSING. THING SO I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL THE- AS AS MANY LIKE YEAH WELL AND WITH THAT I THINK I SEE MR GOING HAVE. BEEN I JUST HAD. A COUPLE OF THEIR- FIND. ONCE STATE LANDS OF BY BE YOUR BEST RESOURCE TO GET A LOT. OF THE INFORMATION ON ALL THOSE CONTRACTS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND THERE ARE TWO KINDS ARE THE TEN YEAR. THEY RENEW EVERY TEN YEARS THERE'S THE SECOND KIND TWENTY FIVE. SO EACH HAS A PERIOD OF TIME. TO WHICH YOU CAN APPLY FOR NON RENEWAL AND THERE'S A BUYOUT CLAUSE IN THOSE THEY DO GO ON FOREVER AUTOMATIC. IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING TO JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. I THINK THE REAL POINT. COMING BACK TO THE TRIBAL ISSUE. HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHERE DOES THAT MONEY. GO DOES IT GO. TO THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AT THE B. I. A. AT IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR BECAUSE OF ALL THEIR LANDS OR NATIONAL TRUST. SO EVERYTHING HAS TO BE APPROVED. THROUGH THE- THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT. THROUGH THEIR DEPARTMENT THERE- IN CONCERT WITH THE TRIBAL AGENCIES. BECAUSE NOT ALL THEIR LANDS ARE TREATED THE SAME. SO THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS. THERE THAT ARE VERY. TECHNICAL SO HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES WORK FOR THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. SO THE WAY WE THE DETAILS OF THIS HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OUTSIDER ARE DEFINITELY STILL BEING WORKED OUT BUT THE VISION IS BROADLY FOR IT TO BE- A- PROGRAMS. THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES AGENCY TO WORK WITH CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES ON CONSERVATION EFFORTS AND CLIMATE EFFORTS THAT THEY UNDERTAKE SO- OKAY. HELLO SO THAT NEXT PART IS WHERE IT THE MONEY PART. CALIFORNIA'S GIVING A GRANT ONE WE TO RECOGNIZE THEIR THEIR A SOVEREIGN NATION BUT THERE INTRUST THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SEQUIN DOESN'T APPLY ON THAT NATIVE LANDS BUT ME BUT DOES UNDER WHAT TERMS AND CONDITIONS WILL BE OPERATED AND ENFORCED WHEN THOSE GRANTS ARE GIVEN TO HIM FOR DEEP FOR DOING SOME OF THESE PROJECTS THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. WHICH ARE RESTORATION TYPE. THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE NOT WORKED OUT THOSE DETAILS YET BUT I'M SURE WE CAN COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT IT. ABSOLUTELY IT'S GONNA BE CRITICAL BECAUSE IF THAT BECOMES THE CASE WERE USUALLY CALIFORNIA WANTS ONLY. ALLOWED TO BE GRANTED UNDER THIS EQUIPMENT. PROVISIONS THEN THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT MONEY AND HAVE IT UTILIZED SO THAT BECOMES. THE TECHNICAL KNOW HOW DO WE HAVE THE GOVERNMENT THE MONEY AND THEN HOW TO COME BACK IN A IN A PROPER WAY. IT'S A LOT OF NUANCES BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. LIKE YOU SAY A LOT OF TECHNICAL STUFF IS GOING ON HERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDER. I'M A HUNTER. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OR MORE. AREN'T BIG DOLLARS.

GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MY NAME IS JIM DELFINO AND I'M REPRESENTING DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND THE CALIFORNIA NEED A PLAN SOCIETY AND- REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE COMMITTEE- HAD A HEARING ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT INITIATIVE THAT CALIFORNIA IS HEADING AND LEADING A NATION AND AS WITH NOTE- I'LL JUST WANT TO THANK YOU- OF FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE PUT INTO THIS ALL OF THE OUTREACH- THAT THEY HAVE COMMITTED TO IT AND- ALL THE WORK THAT IS NOW AHEAD OF THEM- I WON TO. EXPOSE SOME THEMES WERE RAISED BY THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S TODAY- FIRST I THINK IT'S- ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA NOTED THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO ENSURE THAT THIRTY BY THIRTY A CONTINUOUS PATH WITH THE MINISTRATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE IMPORTANT INITIATIVE AND TRY AND IS- APPROPRIATE LET WE- FUNDED- SO THAT'S THE FIRST TO COMMENT THE SECOND I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WE ARE VERY THANKFUL OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT OF FUNDING TO TRIED- RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE IMPORTANT EACH HELPED ME WORK OUT BUT WE ALSO NOTETHAT THERE IS- WE WOULD ALSO ASK THAT THERE BE. INVESTMENTS MADE INTO CAPACITY BUILDING FOR OTHER PARTNERSHIPS- I THINK IT'S THAT SOMETHING GARCIA NOTED THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE ARE PARTICULARLY BY- PROVIDING FUNDING TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND SMALL TRUST TO IDENTIFY AREAS THAT ARE IN HERE- UNDER REPRESENTED IN TERMS OF POP PUBLIC OPEN SPACES- URBAN AREAS AND ALSO AGRICULTURE AREAS. LIKE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FRESNO THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE- A LOT OF PUBLIC SPACE AROUND THEM JUST SOUTH OF HERE IN STOCK IN THE CALAVERAS RIVER RUNS THROUGH A VERY POOR NEIGHBORHOOD- AND IT- COULD BE RESTORED AND PROTECTED AND PROVIDING IMPORTANT URBAN AREA. BUT TO IN ORDER TO GET THAT WORK DONE I THINK SOMEBODY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS NEED SUPPORTING IT AFTER FOR THAT TO BE IN THE BUDGET OR THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE FOR THAT. WE GOT THE THAT'S STRONG SCIENCE- THAT. MAPPING FOR THE STATE CALIFORNIA HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED. THAT IS A VERY BASIC INFORMATION. AND DATA SAID THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE ENTIRE STATE WE'VE MAPPED- 60% OF OUR- WE HAVE. PERCENT LESS.
