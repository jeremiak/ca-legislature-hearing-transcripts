UNDER OUR PACKAGES RIGHT. OUR GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RACHEL EHLERS HERE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO YOUR STAFF HAS ASKED US TO GO THROUGH AT A HIGH LEVEL THAT THREE BIG PACKAGES THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY AND PROVIDE SOME COMPARISON OF THE SENATE- PAST MAJORITY PACKAGES- COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S NAME REVISION PACKAGES SO I WILL START ON PAGE NINETY NINE OF YOUR AGENDA- WAIT FOR THE- WATER AND DROUGHT PACKAGE SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE WATER DOP PACKAGE THE WELFARE PACKAGE AND THE CLIMATE PACKAGE AND FOR THE FIRST TWO ALTHOUGH IT. HAD A PRETTY HIGH LEVEL JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF THE COMPARISONS- SINCE THOSE PACKAGES HAVE BEEN HEARD BY YOU ALREADY IN YOUR COMMUNITY FOR THE THIRD THE CLIMATE PACKAE BECAUSE THE NEW SENATE PROPOSALS IS THE FIRST TIME IT'S COMING BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE UNCLE A LITTLE BIT MORE SLOWLY AND HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF THAT PACKAGE. SO HERE LOOKING AGAIN ON PAGE NINETY NINE AT THE WATER IN DROUGHT PACKAGE COMPARISONS YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SENATE PROPOSAL THAT YOUR SUB COMMITTEE ADOPTED ON MAY FOURTH COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S NAME REVISION PROPOSAL- HAS DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF FUNDING THE GOVERNOR SCOTT MORE FUNDING IT'S SPREAD ACROSS TWO YEARS- A TOTAL OF FOUR POINT FIVE HOWEVER PROPOSED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND YOU'LL SEE THERE ARE MANY SIMILAR PRIORITIES ACROSS THESE TWO PACKAGES BUT ALSO SOME DIFFERENT PRIORITIES- SO YOU CAN SEE THE FIRST LARGE NUMBER THERE FOR ADDRESSING WATER DEBT FOR THE THROUGH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD A BILLION DOLLARS THE GOVERNOR SPECIFIES THAT WOULD BE IN FEDERAL- AND MERICAN RECOVERY PLAN ACT FUNDS THE SENATE- DOESN'T SPECIFY A FUN SOURCE BUT BUT SIMILAR MOUNTAIN THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG ISSUE THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED- IN THE NEXT CATEGORY SMALL COMMUNITY DROUGHT ASSISTANCE YOU CAN SEE SOME DIFFERENCES IN FUNDING SOURCES THERE THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL IT WOULD INCLUDE ONE POINT THREE BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO ADDRESS THAT SAID SAME AMOUNTS FOR SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT IMPLEMENTATION. AND THEN AS YOU GO THROUGH YOU CAN SEE SOME DIFFERENT PRIOR HE'S IN THE IN THE- K. THE SENATE. AS A HIM TO ON ARE. WHY STORM WATER MAN. AND WATER FISH. BOTH IN THE URBAN AND I'M- SETTINGS. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE INCLUDES- SPECIFIC INITIATIVES- THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PRIORITIZED INCLUDING REPAIRS TO CANALS FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. FUNDING FOR THE SOLVENCY AND A LARGE NEW LAND RE PURPOSING PROGRAM THAT IS BEING PROPOSED AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR DROUGHT RESPONSE IN THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL AS COMPARED TO THE SENATE. SO THAT'S THE WATER PACKAGE- NEXT WILL TURN TO PAGE ONE HUNDRED AND THREE OF YOUR AGENDA. AND THIS IS LOOKING AT THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION PACKAGE- THERE'S SEVERAL COLUMNS IN THIS FIGURE ON PAGE ONE HUNDRED AND THREE BUT I THINK PROBABLY THE MOST RELEVANT ARE THE MOST RIGHT HANDS A LETTER TO COLUMNS WHICH IS LOOKING AT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION- AND THE SENATE PACKAGE WHICH YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE ADOPTED. AND HERE AGAIN YOU CAN SEE ONE OF THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES IS IN FUNDING AMOUNTS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS SEVEN OF ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION WHERE IS THE SENATE PACKAGES A BILLION DOLLARS AND ALSO THE SENATE PACKAGE THAT EXPRESSES INTENT FOR THAT BILLION DOLLARS TO BE. REPEATED FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO FIVE BILLION TOTAL- ME HERE YOU CAN SEE MOST OF THE CATEGORIES ARE REALLY THE SAME IT'S JUST REALLY A RELATIVELY MINOR DIFFERENCE IN AMOUNT- BETWEEN THE TWO PACKAGES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THE SAME AS THAT AS WAS PROPOSED IN JANUARY IT'S JUST REALLY WHAT WASN'T INCLUDED IN THAT EARLY ACTION PACKAGE. THE BIGGEST PIECES FOR THE CLIMATE CATALYST FUND THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE EARLY ACTION SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ROLLS THAT INTO- HIS MAY REVISION BUT REALLY OTHERWISE IT'S THE SAME ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT- THROUGHOUT. THROUGHOUT THE SPRING THROUGH THE PROCESS THE SENATE PACKAGE JUST AS A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY FOR SEVERAL OF THOSE CATEGORIES AND THEN AGAIN ACROSS- FIVE YEARS RATHER THAN ONE YEAR. AND THEN FOR THE FINAL. YOU DISCUSSING THIS MORE. TRY TO PAY ONE AND TWO. OF YOUR AGENDA- SO THIS IS NEW NUTRI IN FRONT OF YOU- SENATE CLIMATE PACKAGE- THIS PAGE ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE HAS THAT HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTIONS OF ALL OF THE CATEGORIES IT TOTALS THREE POINT SIX SEVEN FIVE BILLION. IN GENERAL FUND BUT IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA THAT HAS THE COMPARISON CHART ACROSS THE TWO PACKAGES SENATE- MAJORITY PACKAGE HERE BEFORE YOU AND THE GOVERNOR'S ME REVISION GOVERNORS MAY REVISION WOULD BE ACROSS THREE YEARS WAS THE SENATE PACKAGES JUST ONE YEAR- AND BUT YET AGAIN HERE YOU CAN SEE A RETTY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN FUNDING AT THEM THIS CASE IT'S- MORE FUNDING FROM THE SENATE. AS COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION. AS COMPARED TO ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION. I AND IN THE KIND OF WHILE THERE ARE SOME SIMILAR ACTIVITIES I THINK IN THIS PACKAGE YOU YOU REALLY WILL SEE A DIFFERENT MIX OF PRIORITIES ACROSS THE TWO PACKAGES AS COMPARED. TO THE WILDFIRE WHERE THEY'RE REALLY PRETTY SIMILAR. SO JUST AGAIN WALKING THROUGH A LITTLE BIT SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THI IS BEFORE YOU. THE FIRST CATEGORIES REGIONAL CLIMATE RESILIENCE THE SENATE PACKAGE INCLUDES SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION TOTAL. FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION FOR STATE CONSERVANCIES TO UNDERTAKE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROJECTS. AND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOUR AREAS THAT AREN'T COVERED BY THOSE CONSERVANCY'S THOSE WOULD BE GRANTS FROM THAT- CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE. YOU CAN SEE THOSE THOSE FUNDING AMOUNTS IN ACTIVITIES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HOWEVER THAT DOES HAVE. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES HAVE MORE FUNDING FOR PLANNING AND CAPACITY BUILDING AT. THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE. THE NEXT CAT FOR CURBING EVERY- AT SOME. FUNDING SOMEWHAT. HERE FOR URBAN GREENING AND COOLING AND RESILIENCE CENTERS- THESE THE GOVERNOR'S AMOUNT INCLUDES HERE AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION THAT'S ACTUALLY AND THAT- CDFA BUDGET. THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE FOR RE PURPOSING SOME FAIRGROUNDS BUT- REFLECTED HERE JUST BECAUSE IT IS A SIMILAR ACTIVITIES TO WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE SENATE PACKAGE- SIMILARLY BOTH PACKAGES INCLUDE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION AND RESEARCH BUT MORE IN THE SENATE PACKAGE THAT AMOUNT IN THE GOVERNOR'S IS REALLY PRIMARILY FOR. THE FOURTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT WHEREAS THE SENATE PACKAGE DOESN'T SPECIFY HOW THAT FUNDING WOULD BE DIRECTED. AND THEN YOU CAN SEE ADDITIONAL FUNDING HERE ON THE GOVERNOR'S COLUMN FOR SOME SPECIFIC INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE. NOT INCLUDED IN THE SENATE PACKAGE. THE NEXT CAT FOR WHAT SHOULD BE YOU CAN PRETTY SO. DIFFERENCE ACROSS THERE'S QUITE A BIT MORE MONEY IN THE SENATE PACKAGE THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION FOR MULTI BENEFIT FLOOD PROTECTION AND DELTA LEVEES. WHICH COMPARES TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S THAT'S ROUGHLY SIMILAR IN THE GOVERNOR'S- PACKAGE ACTUALLY IN THE WATER PACKAGE BUT FOR SIMILAR ACTIVITIES FOR HABITAT RESTORATION. AND MULTI BENEFIT- PROJECTS. THAN THE SENATE PACKAGE HAS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR PROTECTION OF LAKES STREAMS AND RIVERS AND AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION. FOR URBAN STREAMS AND RIVERS INCLUDING THE LA RIVER AND PARKWAY- FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE SENATE PACKAGE FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE PROTECTION ACTIVITIES. WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE. THE SENATE PACKAGE INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION FOR VARIOUS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SUPPLY RESILIENCE ACTIVITIES NOW THIS IS GOING TO DO THIS WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE RESILIENT. AGRICULTURE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE EXCUSE ME PACKAGE THAT YOUR COMMITTEE ALSO DISCUSSED AND ADOPTED AND A SEPARATE AGRICULTURE PACKAGE THAT THE GOVERNOR ALSO INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION- BUT NONE OF THE NONE OF THE ACTIVITIES IN THOSE PACKAGES ARE ARE SIMILAR TO THESE AND THE GOVERNOR DID NOT HAVE THIS AGRICULTURE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES IN HIS. CLIMATE PACKAGE. OUR NEXT FOR CONSUMER AGAIN THIS IS IN AREA WHERE YOU SEE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ACROSS THE TWO PROPOSALS- IN FUNDING AMOUNTS THE SENATE PACKAGE INCLUDES NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION. SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY WOULD BE THROUGH THAT STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY WITH A HUNDRED MILLION RESERVED FOR PROJECTS IN THAT SAME JUST KOBE. AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION AUTHORITY. WETLAND RESTORATION PROJECTS. ARE BOTH PACKAGES INCLUDE AMOUNTS FOR THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL TO RUN PROJECTS BUT BUT DIFFERENT AMOUNTS THAT WOULD BE THE PRIMARY VEHICLE- THAT THE GUY. WOULD YOU USE FOR FUNDING FOR SEA LEVEL RISE. ACTIVITIES COASTAL PROTECTION ACTIVITIES- AND THEN THE SAME YOU CAN SEE IN SOME OTHER SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS FORTY MILLION FOR THE CENTER- SANTA ANA RIVER CONSERVANCY THIRTY MILLION FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION. FOR LOCAL GRANTS FOR SEA LEVEL RISE AND THEN TWENTY MILLION FOR THE OTHER DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE FOR HELP RESTORATION AND FISHERY PROTECTION. WHERE IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HAS TWELVE MILLION SPECIFICALLY FOR STATE PARKS TO UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES ON STATE PARK LANDS RELATED TO SEA LEVEL RISE- PREPARATION. AND THEN IN THE FINAL CATEGORY YOU CAN SEE HIM FALL FOR DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S CLIMATE PACKAGE THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SENATE PACKAGE. SO LITTLE BIT MORE OF A DIFFERENCE HERE AND IN THIS PACKAGE AS COMPARED TO FOR EXAMPLE THE WILDFIRES WE DISCUSSED. SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE AS WELL IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT TO NOTE. AS AS A REMINDER THAT THESE ARE OUR SENATE MAJORITY PAC JUSTIN NOT LA OKAY I CAN JUST SAY WE'RE HAPPY TO. ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE BUT IF. IF THEIR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS ABOUT. PRIORITIES ARE WHY THESE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES OR WHAT THIS SPECIFIC SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES WOULD BE THOSE OF HOW TO BE BETTER DIRECTED THROUGH THE CHAIR TO COMMITTEE STAFF AND MLA- BUT WE'RE HERE TO. HELP AS AS BEST WE CAN. RIGHT I THANK YOU D. I NOTICE YOU STARTED OFF. WITH THE IDEA WORK THE CONCEPT AND THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY WILL GO BACKWARDS. IS THAT THIS IS A ONE YEAR PACKAGE. BY THE- SENATE FOR THREE POINT SIX SEVEN FIVE. BILLION DOLLARS FOR CITY GOVERNORS. IS ONE POINT SEVEN- IN ALTHOUGH THIS RECOMMENDATION IS THAT. WE TAKE THEM RIGHT NOW BUT WE SPEND IT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT. YEAH I THINK I THINK- THAT IS DEFINITELY AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION YOU ALL SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IT YOU'RE PUTTING THESE TOGETHER REALLY JUST WHAT IS THE CAPACITY OF DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO ABSORB A HUGE INFLUX OF FUNDING AT AT ONE TIME SO. I THINK THINKING ABOUT SPREADING IT IN A WAY THAT- THAT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE GOVERNMENT FRANKLY CAN ACCOMMODATE AS IT IS AN APPROACH THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE. AND THEN ALTHOUGH WE WERE NOT HAVING A DISCUSSION ON THE TAX PACKAGE COULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE- THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO- USE A SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR. FINE WE HAVE WE HAVE OUR PACKAGE IF THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE WE'RE- WE'RE- MOVING THEM FOR BUT WERE USING THE- THE DETERMINATION ON THE FINAL AGREEMENT WILL BE THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY- BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE. MIGHT BE IN THE CLIMATE PACKAGE THAT SOME FOLKS WILL LOOK TO THEM AS THE IN THE ACT PACKAGE. HE I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU WELL IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED BUT TO THINK ABOUT ALL OF THESE PACKAGES TOGETHER BECAUSE NOT INCLUDED HERE IS CAP AND TRADE AS WELL WHICH HAS A LOT OF THE SIMILAR. TYPE ACTIVITIES SO EVEN THOUGH IT MAKES IT HARDER THESE AREN'T STANDALONE PACKAGES THAT JUST KIND OF GO OFF AND GET IMPLEMENTED- INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT THAT INTERACTION OUR PRIORITIES OF OTHER PACKAGES OF CERTAINLY A CAP AND TRADE- AGRICULTURE IN ADDITION TO THESE THREE AS WELL AS IT IS THAT DISASTER PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES THAT ARE- BEING CONSIDERED THROUGH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES REALLY THINKING. HOLISTICALLY ABOUT WHAT ARE ALL OF YOUR PRIORITIES WHAT ARE THE ACTIVITIES YOU WANT TO- MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE ACCOMPLISHES WITH THIS- REALLY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY pTHIS YEAR AND NOT GET WORRIED ABOUT WHICH SILO THERE AND NOT REALLY THINK ABOUT THEM TOGETHER. BECAUSE I THINK THIS AGAIN THE CAP AND TRADE WE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON THAT BEFORE- THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT THEIR DETERMINATION TO KEEP CAP AND TRADE. CLIMATE POLICY RATHER THAN POLLUTION POLICY AND WE'VE WE'VE HAD SOME SUGGESTIONS THAT ARE IN THERE DIRECTING- BUT WHEN YOU'RE A- FROM GENERAL FUND SO THAT WE CAN. LOOK AT THIS HOLISTIC- INTERPLAY BETWEEN THESE HUGE PACKAGES THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE GOING ON- IS THERE SOMETHING THAT. ALL THESE PACKAGES TAKEN TOGETHER FROM THE ALLEY OWES POSITION THAT WE HAVE FAILED TO ADDRESS. SEEMS AN ALMOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE BUT IS THERE IS THERE SOMETHING FROM THE LA O'S OFFICE THAT WE HAVE SORT OF MISSED EITHER IN THE CLIMATE PACKAGE IN THE BACK PACKAGE IN THE DROUGHT PACKAGE. IN THE WILDFIRES PACKAGE. YEAH IT'S CERTAINLY- AND YOU KNOW A MATTER OF PRIORITIES AND IF YOU LOOK KIND OF IN THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGES IN THE SENATE'S PACKAGING EATING THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN HERE. I THINK WHEN THE AREA THAT WE HAVE HIGHLIGHTED IN SOME OF OUR REPORTS PREVIOUSLY IN PARTICULAR AND THEN SOME OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE ON SEA LEVEL RISE IS THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLAY. AND ESPECIALLY WHERE THAT'S WHERE THE LAND USE DECISIONS ARE MADE THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS SOUND AND SO THINKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT YOU CAN GIVE. AND WHAT THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE STATE IS IN SUPPORTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR PLANNING- AND FOR IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS AND IN PARTICULAR FOR WORKING ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL LINES AND LOOKING AT A REGIONAL LEVEL FOR SEA LEVEL RISE THAT'S GOING TO BE HUGE AND SO- THAT THAT MAY BE AN AREA YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE IS HOW. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND SUPPORTING AND HELPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PLANNING AND BREAKING DOWN SOME pLEVEL SO THEY. CAN BE WORKING AT A REGIONAL LEVEL. IN DM I KNOW THAT THE SENATE WHILE. PACK AHEAD. EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR OPR TO DO WHILE FOR. CLAY AT. PLANNING ALTHOUGH. SENATE PACKAGE ON CLIMATE RESILIENCY. IS SILENT ON THE CLIMATE ADAPTATION PLANNING GRANTS AND THE- REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE. PROGRAM SO THERE'S LESS PLANNING DOLLARS. A BOATLOAD OF MONEY INTO PROJECTS. IF THE PROJECTS ARE READY IF YOU'VE DONE YOUR WORK THERE'S MONEY FOR THE PROJECTS BUT THERE THERE'S NOT IT APPEARS AS YOU AS YOU LOOK AT THAT AT LEAST ON THIS FIRST ROUND THAT THERE'S NOT WE'RE NOT CALLING OUT THE PLANNING DOLLARS THAT'S FAIR FAIR ENOUGH CRITICISM FOR IDENTIFICATION. LET'S GO TO MEMBERS WE HAVE THE SRVER THE DISCUSSION ONLY EVEN THOUGH I'VE TEETERING AROUND WITH NON NON DISCUSSION ITEMS WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR DISCUSSION ON THE DISCUSSION ITEMS OTHER COMMENTS WE WANT TO MAKE ON ON. PART A AND PART B. THAT ARE NOT A DISCUSSION ITEM ON THESE THREE PACKAGES- WE'LL TAKE UP AFTER A BREAK THAT'S OKAY. SECURITIZED IN SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR AGENCY WHICH I CAN HOLD WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO HOLD THOSE UNTIL AFTER THE BREAK WOULD THAT BE. DO THEY COME UNDER ANY OF THESE PACKAGES. ABSENCE TO CIVIC ITEMS IN REGARDS TO CAL FIRE AND STAFFING. DECIDED TO KEEP. AN EYE ON THE WILDFIRES YEAH ON THE WIFI YEAH. PLUG IT IN RIGHT OKAY I I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE IF WE HAVE TO PORTER ON THE LINE WE HAVE SUPPORT ONLINE. ALL RIGHT. CHIEF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME- I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS CHIEF ON THE ISSUE OF- ALL ISSUES- OF ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT THAT YOU HAVE I THINK IT'S ON PAGE SEVENTEEN ISSUE THIRTEEN- WITHIN OUR PACKAGE. AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND DESTROY BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN A BEAR TO TACKLE SO VERY GRATEFUL MISTER CHAIR. MISTER I FOR ALL THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS. CHIEF LOOK I THINK A OF ITEMS THAT ONE. I WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT WE WOULD HAVE SEEN A DISH OR TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ONE FULL TIME FIREFIGHTERS AND I THOUGHT WE ARE GONNA SEE THIS YEAR COMING BACK. TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE NOT. IN RETURN RECEIPT ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS THAT WILL BE DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TWELVE HUNDRED OF THOSE I BELIEVE ARE ALREADY IN STATION WHICH IS BIG NEWS AND WHEN I SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP SIR. BUT TALK ABOUT. THE ISSUE OF THESE ADMINISTRATIVE. POSITIONS NUMBER ONE. HOW DOES THIS HELP. THOSE FIREFIGHTERS THAT ARE ON THE LINE- FREE THEM UP. TWO DO YOU HAVE ANY ESTIMATE ON HOW THIS IS GOING TO FREE UP FIRE FIGHTING TIME- AND CANDIDLY WHY THIS AND NOT LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL POSITIONS CHIEF I KNOW I JUST THREW THREE QUESTIONS OUT OF JAIL IF THAT'S OKAY- MISTER CHAIR. REPORTER THANK YOU- THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU NEED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT AND THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE FOR YOUR QUESTION WELL WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS OUR- ZERO- DIRECT MISSIONS OF COURT- PROPOSAL. AND WHAT- WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON IS THERE EVEN A COUPLE OF THINGS WHEN WE HAVE A LARGE INCIDENTS AS EVERY SINGLE YEAR WE'RE HAVING MORE AND MORE LARGE INCIDENTS- ABOUT FIVE SIX YEARS AGO. TEN TWENTY YEARS AGO WE WOULD HAVE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS TO THE TUNE OF. ABOUT FIVE ON AVERAGE- THAT WOULD BE DEPLOYED IN A YEAR LAST YEAR WE HAD TWENTY OF THOSE DEPLOYMENTS. AND WHEN WE DO THAT WE. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT- JUST SEEING A- LET ME OF FUNK THAT FOLLOWS IN. YEAH BIAS PROCURER STUFF THINGS WE NEED TO- TO MANAGE THAT. INCIDENT BASED UP SUPPORT- BULLDOZERS AIRCRAFT WAR HAND CREWS SOMETIMES FROM OUT OF STATE- AND OR ENGINES ALL OF THAT HAPPENING AS WELL AS ACCOMMODATIONS AND FEEDING FOR THE FOR THE CRUISER AT THESE INCIDENTS. ALL OF THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE BASE THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE- DEVELOP. IT'S A IT'S A EXTREME WORKLOAD ON ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO- ROUTINELY NOW IS OVER UNIFORMS STAFF. FIREFIGHTERS THAT ARE TRAINED TO BE ON FIRE ENGINES IN COMMAND POSITIONS OUT ON THE FIRE LINE. WE REDIRECT THEM INTO BASE OR INTO HEADQUARTERS TO- TO MEET THAT NEED. YEAH SO WE'RE DOING THAT A REACH BASIS WE'VE THAT THERE. A OF THOUSAND OF THAT TIME OF WORK BEING BY YOU STAFF THANK. BE DONE BY- BY ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF- YEAH FRANKLY A LOWER COST THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE TO THIS WHEN WE PUT A FIREFIGHTER INTO THAT POSITION WE STILL HAVE TO FIRE HI HIGHER AND- WE STILL HAVE TO KEEP THE FIRE ENGINE RUNNING SO WE- WE HAVE TO HIRE BEHIND SO WE'RE PAYING OVERTIME FOR THE POSITION THAT'S DOING THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK AND- OF. THAT ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION AND WE'RE ALSO HIRING A SECOND BODY TO COVER THE FIRE ENGINE AND. THAT'S THAT'S CONTRIBUTING. OUR OF NOT GETTING OUR FIREPLACE ENOUGH. AND TRYING RELAX A TO RESEARCH AND BE FOR THE NEXT INCIDENT. SO ALL OF THAT IS PART OF THIS EQUATION. AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE COME UP WITH THIS PROPOSAL TO SHIFT. THE FUND. SHARE THIS. NET ZERO REQUEST. PROBLEM DOLLARS THAT WE ALL HAVE BEEN ALL. TO DO THIS ANNUALLY FOR THAT PROCESS THAT I JUST MENTIONED SO. THERE'S NO AND NO pACTUALLY WE THINK THERE WILL BE SOME SOME SAVINGS. THAT HUNDRED THOUSAND HOURS EQUATES TO ABOUT A THOUSAND WORKDAYS WHEN YOU GET TO THE TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE PEOPLE ON ON THE GROUND DOING THE INCIDENT IN BASE. THE OTHER THING ABOUT THE IS THESE- INCIDENCES. THE FINANCE PORTION AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE PORTION GOES ON FOR WEEKS SOMETIMES MONTHS AFTER AN INCIDENT CLOSES SO THE FIREFIGHTERS ALTHOUGH HOME WE STILL HAVE TO DO ALL THE PROCESSING OF THOSE BILLS. AND IN SOME CASES WE ARE SIX TO TEN MONTHS BEHIND ON PAYING OUR BILLS FOR- FOR. RENDERING. SERVICES AND- NOT ONLY THAT BUT THIS YEAR INTO WHAT WILL BE BIG CHAT YOU WITH CONDITION WE ARE HAVE ALL A THOUSAND BY MORE THAN WE HAVE. BUDGETED TO THIS DAY. AND GOT ABOUT FIVE TIMES THE NUMBER OF ACRES- RIGHT NOW. SO GOING INTO THIS SEASON WE HAVE VENDORS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE CALLING UPON TO RENDER SERVICES AGAIN TO THE STATE. WE HAVEN'T BEEN PAID FOR LAST YEAR'S- AFTER AND SO- NOT ONLY ARE THEY- SO IN SOME REAL TO BACK BUT THEY'RE ALSO. ARE CASES WHERE- WE- GOING TO BE ASKING FOR THOSE- THAT THAT- BUSINESS IS ABOUT GONE UNDER OF AND WE'RE PAYING THE- THE LATE FEE AND- PENALTIES TO THAT WE HAVE TO ON MAKING. PAYMENTS GOOD. SO IF THIS IS VERY TO ME- IF VERY IMPORTANT ME FOR KEEPING THE BUSINESS OF ARTICLE GOING FORWARD. IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY DOES PUT. SOME OF THOSE FIREFIGHTERS THAT WHERE WE ARE NOT IN OUR CURRENT REQUEST. INTO THE BACK INTO THE SYSTEM TO REDUCE THAT WORK LOAD ON THE ENGINE STAFF THAT IS SO OVERCAST AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO A TIME WHEN WE CAN COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT. THE STAFF THAT WE NEED. TO BUILD THE DEPARTMENT TO THE FUNCTION THAT IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO MEET GOING INTO THE FUTURE BUT THIS IS THE POINT IN TIME WHEN WE REALLY NEED THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. AND THE RELIEF OF THOSE THOSE UNIFORMS STAFFED BY JUST TO GET THROUGH THIS COMING YEAR AND THE END OF YOUR STAY CONTINUE TO GET WORSE AND WORSE AS WE SPEAK. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS BUT THAT IS THE ADDRESS THANKS TO ALL OF SENATOR SENATOR MCGUIRE'S QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CHIEF I DIDN'T NEED TO GO TO- FINANCE I FORGOT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION BUT I DID LIKE YOUR COMP WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT ON ISSUE NUMBER NINETY ONE THAT. THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ALLEY- AND WE'VE WE LOOK AT THE CAL FIRE CATEGORIES AND COMPARE THE GOVERNORS MAY REVISION. TO THE- TO THE SENATE PROPOSAL IT LOOKS LIKE HEALTHY FOREST GETS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS MORE THE GOVERNOR HAS A HUNDRED MILLION. IN THE SENATE HAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION THE SAME WITH THE PROGRAM FOR FORCE IMPROVEMENTS FOR SMALL LAND OWNERS WE- 20% HIGHER. THE SENATE HAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL VERSUS FORTY WE'VE GOT THERE'S MORE MONEY IN THE LEG AND FORCED LEGACY IN THE REFORESTATION OF NURSERY. A THREE MILLION DOLLARS MORE TWO MILLION AND URBAN FORESTRY YOU GO DOWN TO YOUR- YOUR ABOUT PRESCRIBED BURNS IN HAND CRUISES ANOTHER FIVE MILLION. MILLION DOLLARS- WOULDN'T AREN'T THOSE RESOURCES I MEAN THIS IS IT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE SENATE VERSION. WOULD PROVIDE CAL FIRE WITH MORE RESOURCES. TO MEET THEIR THEIR CHARGE. THAT'S A GREAT. IS SENATOR HOUSE. AND WHERE WE- OUT. SO IN THAT AREA AS WELL THOSE THOSE ARE HE- GRASS. INCREASE THEY DO NOT- THEY THEY ARE NOT THE POSITIONS AND THEY ARE NOT POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE REDIRECTED IN THIS FASHION AS I MENTIONED. WHAT WHAT WHAT THE DIRECT MISSION SUPPORT PIECES SPECIFICALLY FOR- OUR MEETING OF THE EXPANDING NEEDS OF ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FOR OUR FIREFIGHTING MISSIONS SO. THEY ARE VERY SEPARATE AND IF WE PULL THEM OFF OF THAT MISSION LET'S JUST SAY- THAT WOULD THAT WOULD THAT LEAVE US AT A DEFICIT IN BEING ABLE TO MEET THE MISSION. OF DELIVERING THESE THESE RESILIENCY DOLLARS- IN A WAY THAT WE COMMITTED TO DO SO. I GUESS ONE FINAL QUESTION BEFORE I GO TO FINANCE SAID THE. SENATE VERSION. IS FIVE YOUR- AND A PLAY FOR OF VIEW WERE CAL. A DOZEN THE IF YOU WERE A ONE YEARS FOR THIS SO THE BE SURE WHAT THE MO. IS BEFORE US BUT THAT THE ACTUAL PACKAGE FOR A FIVE YEAR- PROPOSAL DOESN'T THAT IS NOT SUPERIOR TO THE ONE YEAR PROGRAM THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE HIS COME UP BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO USE. YOUR YOU'VE GOT LONG TERM PLANNING IN FIRE RESEARCH FOR PREVENTION AND RESILIENCE HEAP OF PROPOSALS WOULDN'T THAT GIVE YOUR CREW. BETTER PLANNING TOOLS TO MEET TO CHARGES OF THE NEXT. THAT DECADE. AGAIN WITH THE WITH THE- WITH THE RESILIENCY PACKAGE OR THAT THAT THAT PIECE OF THIS- THE PLANNING AND THE LONG TERM- EFFORTS THERE THOUGH THIS IS ONE TIME FINDING IT AS AN EXTENDED ENCUMBRANCE AND WE THOSE THOSE POSITIONS ARE SHOWN AS PERMANENT POSITIONS. SO WE WILL WE WILL WORK FORWARD- WITH THOSE POSITIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACCOUNTING FOR THEM GOING DOWNSTREAM- AND THAT'S A LITTLE SEPARATE FROM WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS OTHER PROPOSALS AND THAT ZERO- SHIFT AND THE PERMANENT HIRING OF THOSE POSITIONS. SO WE AREN'T IN- ICE CYCLE OF TRYING TO HIRE THESE OR QUARTER OF CORPORATE UNIFORMS IN PLACES WHERE WE WHERE WE CANNOT. FILL THOSE NEEDS ON A ON AN INCIDENT FOR INSTANCE OKAY- LET ME GET THIS BACK ON SCHEDULE I WANT TO GO TO MISTER AGUILAR AT FINANCE BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT ON PART BE SO COLLEAGUES PLEASE FORGIVE. ME- THE ACTION THAT WERE TO HERE I'M BE IS TO SEND ATOP A ZERO OF ACTIONS ADVANCE TO THE TROUT. AGRA AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE CONSISTING WITH THE AGENDA. OUR LINE ON THIS OF THIS PLAN HOWEVER AS I INTIMATED WE'RE NOT BACKING AWAY FROM SEVEN SET IT'S PURPLE. FOR RATHER THEM TO THE NEXT SET TO THE FULL BUDGET. WHERE THE PROCESS AND DISCUSSIONS WILL CONTINUE BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR BEFORE YOU REACH THE FINAL BUDGET. MEETING CELLS HAVE INTIMATED WE STILL HAVE A FIVE YEAR WILDFIRE PACKAGE ALTHOUGH WE'RE TAKING ACTION TO FUNDED FOR ONE YEAR. IF FIVE MEMBERS CAN TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO ITEM NUMBER THIRD. THIRTY FOUR ON THE PARK'S PROPOSAL WE'RE GOING TO ADD. THAT ON TO THE BUDGET TRAILER PAYROLL BY THE TRAILER LANGUAGE IN THE B. C. P. ADD A FISCAL STABILITY FOR BOATING PROGRAMS IS GOING TO BE PULLED FROM THE- THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR AND WE WILL NOT VOTE ON ITEM NUMBER THIRTY FOUR. TODAY WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT AND WE GET TO THE SENATE ALSO THERE'S SEVERAL ITEMS- ITEM NUMBER SEVENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT. SEVENTY NINE AND EIGHTY ONE- WE HAVE STAFF- WRECKED. AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ON AND TO THE CAN OF EACH OF THOSE WE'RE GOING ADD- THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE IN THIS WOULD BE LIKE FOR INSTANCE ITEM NUMBER SEVENTY EIGHTH IS HEALTHY RESILIENT AND- EQUITABLE FOOD SERVICES. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO PROVE HIS PROPOSED TO REQUIRE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE FROM THE DEPARTMENT SO IT'S APPROVED BUT WE HAVE- YOU KNOW ON THE VALUE IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAMS FOR THE CALIPH. OF FARM TO SCHOOL IN COMPUTER PROGRAM PROGRAM THE URBAN AGRICULTURAL GRANT PROGRAM AND THE HEALTHY REFRIGERATION GRANT PROGRAM. AND WE WERE FED- THIRTY SECONDS WILL CONFORM WITH THE FINAL AGRICULTURAL PACKAGE SO IT'S JUST AN ADDENDUM. ULTRA PACKAGE WITH THAT CLARIFICATION I APOLOGIZE MISTER AGUILAR WITH FINANCE YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THE- THE DISCUSSION ITEMS IT'S THIS GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS IN THE SENATE RULES. A GOOD MORNING SURE NUMBERS OR DRUG THAT WAS OUR FINANCE ALL KEEP OUR COMMENTS GREAT BREACH GIVEN THAT WE JUST THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS DURING LAST WEEK'S HEARING AND- YOU WANT TO BE AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS LET ME JUST TRY TO REITERATE I THINK FROM FROM LAST WEEK'S HEARING- YOU KNOW OVERALL WHEN YOU COMBINE THE WALL TO WALL. CLIMATE RELATED PACKAGES ADMINISTRATION ROLE IS OVER ELEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND A STRATEGIC AND ONCE IN A LIFETIME INVESTMENTS TO HELP ADVANCE SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S CLIMATE INITIATIVES. I THINK AS WAS NOTED EARLIER HE NOTED THERE DOES APPEAR TO BE A GREAT DEAL OF OVERLAP AND IN MANY CASES ALIGNMENTS AND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS AND INVESTMENTS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND THOSE PROPOSED AND AS PART OF THE VARIOUS SENATE PROPOSALS- AND YOU KNOW WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION MAYOR VISIN PROPOSALS BACK KNOWLEDGE THERE WILL BE. ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ON THE DETAILS OF THESE PACKAGES AS A BUDGET IS BEING FINALIZED AND WE HAVE A VERY IS FINE AND STAFF AND DEPARTMENT STAFF AVAILABLE TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS- ON. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PACKAGES. OKAY THANK YOU WE WILL OBVIOUSLY YOUR INPUT LET'S TURN TO SAY SIR. ON OUR- THIS. ITEMS THANK YOU MR CHAIR- ONE OF GET TO. PROPER I'M NOT SURE WHICH DEPARTMENT THEY SHOULD GO THROUGH BUT I WANT TO GET THE ROOT. SOME FEEDBACK FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON A FEW ITEMS- STARTING WITH THE WATER AND DROUGHT PACKAGE IN THE COMPARISONS HERE- FOR ME LA- ANALYSIS FROM STAFF ANALYSIS WE'VE SEEN. IT SEEMS TO BE A DISPARITY BETWEEN THE SENATE PROPOSAL AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON RECYCLED WATER GROUNDWATER CLEANUP AND STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SO I WAS HOPING I THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THOSE HOPING TO GET- SOME COMMENTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON- WHAT LOOKS LIKE A- SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO THOSE. ELEMENTS OF RESPONSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT 60% OF THE STATE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- WITH SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM WATER NEEDS FOR THIS ONE TIME INVESTMENT- WE JUST GOT SOME LETTERS FROM OUR YOU KNOW FROM SAN DIEGO AND LA WHO USUALLY AREN'T ON THE SAME PAGE WITH WATER- TALKING ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO EXPAND UP TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS SHOVEL READY RIGHT NOW SO I JUST WANTED TO GET A SENSE FROM- THE LOGIC OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S. MAY REVISE PROPOSAL ON THOSE ELEMENTS. THIRD ROAD RUNNING FINE AND I'LL JUST I'LL KICK IT OFF AND THEN- YOU KNOW WE HAVE COLLEAGUES HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT THAT COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS. I THINK ONE THING. THEY'LL START OFF BY NOTING IS. ACROSS SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS VERY VERY S. ELIGIBLE USES AND DIFFERENT ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES AND SO EVEN THOUGH FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW YOU DON'T SEE. GROUNDWATER CLEANUP CALLED OUT SPECIFICALLY IN SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THEY ARE LIKE AN ELIGIBLE USE OF OTHER TYPES OF. PROGRAMS THAT HAVE LIKE A LUMP AND DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE ONE OF THE- ADS WERE BEING CROSSWALKS OF A LOT OF THESE PACKAGES SOMETIMES. WERE CALLING THINGS DIFFERENTLY BUT BUT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF SIMILAR ELIGIBLE USES WITHIN THE EXISTING PROGRAMS TARGETING ALSO WROTE BY NOTING THAT- THEN THE OTHER YOU KNOW JUST ISSUE ALTHOUGH IT IS- YOU KNOW AS WE WERE LOOKING AT- THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDING AND WE- ALLOCATED DOLLARS TOWARDS THAT- THERE'S SPECIFIC TIMELINES THAT- KIND OF IDENTIFIED AS- WHEN. THE MONEY NEED TO BE COVERED- IN LIQUIDATED A PART OF COUNTRY TO THE WE HAD A SOME OF THESE INVESTOR. I WAS LOOKING. YOU KNOW WHERE THERE ARE SOME SOME PROJECTS. COULD MEET THOSE THOSE. RE SO JUST A THINGS AND- BUT NOT SURE IF- BUT THE WAY BORDER OR DEPART A WATERY. AS ANY MORE DETAILS ASK TO OF THEIR PER. AND HOW. IT ADDRESSES RECYCLING AND GARBAGE WATER THE. THIS WILL STORM WATER COULD. YOUR HIGHNESS IS MY LAW WITH CLOSE LOTTERY. CONTROL BOARD AND WE ADMINISTER BOTH THE WATER IS AND GROUNDWATER CLEANUP FUNDING AND THE AS FAR AS WATERY. THAT MOST ARE ELEGY FOR OUR STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS AND SO THAT IS TO PICK WHERE WE FUND WATER RECYCLE PROJECT. WE OFTEN DO HAVE A SMALL AMOUNT OF GRANT FUNDS THAT THAT GO ALONG WITH THOSE PHONES BUT THEY'RE GENERALLY TOWARDS THE LARGER MORE SOPHISTICATED AGENCIES THAT ARE DOING THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS AND SO WHAT WE FOCUSED ON WHAT'S THE WATER LIKE DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER. FUNDING FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN IS AS MISTER AGYARKO INDICATED WE'RE PROJECTS THAT COULD MEET THE TIMING OF THE VERY SHORT TIME FRAMES FOR CONSTRUCTING THOSE PROJECTS AND ALSO FOCUSING ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY NEEDS SO WE REALLY FOCUSED. THOSE FUNDS ON ON THOSE PROJECTS AND THE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE PRETTY MUCH IN HOUSE READY TO GO. THAT COULD MEET THOSE CONSTRUCTION TIME FRAMES. OKAY I WOULD JUST NOTE FOR THEIR FOR THE RECORD THAT YOUR YOUR ANALYSIS- FROM THE WATER BOARD INDICATES I THINK SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECTS THAT ARE. READY TO GO SO. AS I KNOW THAT'LL BE AN ONGOING ISSUE FOR DISCUSSION AND APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE. ON THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE OPEN TO GET. HOPING TO RAISE THE QUESTION ON THIS- THIS DISPARITY BETWEEN THE SENATE'S MAY TWENTY FIFTH PROPOSAL AND THEN THE MAY REVISE- ON A REGIONAL CLIMATE RESILIENCE- SPECIFICALLY IN THE- FIRST STATE CONSERVANCIES. AS WELL AS THE REGIONAL CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROJECTS I THINK THE SENATE HAS SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION. DOLLARS THERE AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS- ZERO IN THOSE CATEGORIES- THAT'S A CHALLENGE- THE LA RIVER ALSO IN URBAN STREAMS HAS ZERO- SIR TWENTY GET THEIR PERSPECTIVE I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S BEST. CENTER D. O. F. OR C. N. R. A. BUT HOPING TO- SHED SOME LIGHT ON THOSE DISPARITIES AS WELL. GO AHEAD. FINANCE IF YOU CAN S. OR DIFFERENT FINANCING I'LL KICK IT OFF AND THEN MAYBE A TURNOVER TO LIE RESEARCH AGENCY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ON THE ONE THING ALTHOUGH IT IS YOU KNOW FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT WE DO HAVE THE CONSERVANCY'S AND THE PROJECTS WITHIN THE CONSERVANCIES ARE DEFINITELY ELIGIBLE AND SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY CALLING OUT YOU KNOW X. DOLLAR MATRYX CONSERVANCIES THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT THE PROJECTS AND THE PROGRAMS WITHIN THOSE I WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE SO- YEAH I THINK THAT'S ONE OF PERSPECTIVE IS HAVING. A BROADER PROGRAM ON ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUE AND THEN WITHIN THAT PROGRAM- YOU KNOW HAVING THE PROJECTS WITH THE CONSERVANCY'S BE ABLE TO APPLY TO ALSO MEET THOSE GOALS NOT SURE THE RESERVATIONS. HERE ANYTHING ELSE- ELABORATE ON THAT. I WAS GONNA SAY THE SAME THING THAT. I CAN. ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE OTHER PROGRAM THIS IS CASH THE NATURAL RESOURCE THEY- DO. AND AS TO THE RIVER AND THE OTHER URBAN AND RIVER. THERE IS FUNDING LIKE URBAN GREENING- THAT'S AVAILABLE TO TWO PROJECTS- GREENING PROJECTS THAT COULD BE DONE ALONG THE LA RIVER. IMPORTANT IF THE YEAH WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT SORT OF THE OVERALL WATERSHED PROTECTION ISSUE THOUGH WE'RE WE'VE GOT I THINK THE SENATE'S GOT EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION COMMITTED TO THAT AND THERE'S ABOUT A SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR DISPARITY BETWEEN OUR PROPOSAL AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THERE WHERE- EVEN IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S- SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO MEET THOSE SORT OF MULTI BENEFIT NEEDS SO- JUST TO TRY TO GET. SORT OF THE UNDERLYING POLICY. BECTIVE ON WHY THAT'S NOT AS MUCH OF A PRIORITY. THIS IS BRIAN CASH AGAIN FROM NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY- WE DO FEEL LIKE THOSE THOSE PROGRAMS ARE PRIORITY AND- WHERE POSSIBLE THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING IN OTHER PROGRAMS AND- YOU KNOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY. THROUGH THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE TO- FURTHER REFINED THE PACKAGE THAT NEEDED. WE ARE JUST NOTE DEPUTY CASHIN FOR FINANCE ALSO SAID THERE WAS THE GOVERNOR EARLIER HAD A CLIMATE BOND THAT THAT HE HAD FLOATED OUT THE SENATE HAS A PUBLIC CLIMATE. THE ASSEMBLY HAS A CLAIM UPON AND ONE OF THE CATEGORIES THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT IS THE WATERSHED PROTECTION THE SORT OF STARTS OFF AT THE WATERSHED YES THERE'S EXTREME HEAT ELEMENTS THAT WITH THE URBAN GREENING BUT THERE THERE IS SEEM TO BE- I'VE- BEEN INTERESTED IN WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN THE BUDGET NUMBERS AS AS AS AS THE ENTHUSIASM I GUESS IS WHAT. MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR STERN IS SEARCHING FOR INDEED WEALTH WELL SUMMARIZED IN YOU KNOW WE PUT A LOT OF TIME INTO SP FORTY FIVE AND LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF THAT'S GOING TO BE FOLDED INTO HIS BUDGET SO REALLY HOPING THE SENATE'S PRIORITIES CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN MAINTAIN SOME FOOTING AND AS THE AS THE CONVERSATIONS GO FORWARD- YOU KNOW LASTLY I WOULD JUST RAISE. THE YOU'RE GONNA HEAR ME PAYING THAT THE SAME FROM THE SERMON CHOIR DID- WHEN IT COMES TO- FUNDING ON ON THE HAND CREW SIDE AND TRYING TO GET. OUR CONTRACT COUNTY SORTED BUT ALSO FROM HARDENING AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE PERSPECTIVE IT SEEMS LIKE- THAT THERE CONTINUES TO BE A SORT OF LESSER ROLE ON THAT THE HARDENING FRONT AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM AND MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON- FORCED HEALTH- TYPE PROJECTS OR OTHER SORT OF FUEL TREATMENT PROJECTS- TELEPHONE A FLAG THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THE- CAL FIRE HAS ANY COMMENT THERE BUT- REALLY TRYING TO. FIND A PATH EITHER THROUGH PUBLIC FINDING OR INCENTIVIZING MORE PRIVATE ACTION TO GET SOME METRICS INTO PLACE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE SOME GOALS STAND FOR JUST RECOMMENDED A CO EQUAL FUNDING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS INTO FOR FUEL TREATMENT THAN A BILLION DOLLARS SHOULD BE UNLOCKED SOMEHOW- ON THE HARDENING FRONT FOR SEVEN CAL. AND OTHER. THAT HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS. JUST WANT TO FLAG FOR THE G. ANY PURSE. THERE THOUGH- TO LEND US I KNOW YOU GUYS BEEN WORKING YOUR G. P. IN. TRYING TO GET THAT MOVE. YES SIR AGAIN THANK YOU SENATOR WHITEHOUSE DEEPER AND OLDER YES WITH THE WITH GRAPHS SENATOR STRANGE QUESTION. I LOOK FORWARD TO. CONTINUING THIS THIS CONVERSATION- MORE SPECIFICALLY IN THE FUTURE BUT FOR RIGHT NOW- OUR OUR PROGRAMS. ARE VERY EVENLY- COVERING THE STATE. NOW WE ARE- WE ARE WORKING TO INCREASE OUR APPLICANT POOL AND THE QUALITY OF THOSE APPLICANTS. AND APPLICATIONS PROBLEM AREAS THAT HAVE- BAND I'LL JUST STAY UNDER SERVED BY OUR PROGRAMS- AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. AND LOCAL ELECTED- SO WE ARE VERY MUCH WORKING WITH DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION IN THE REGIONAL COLLABORATIVES THAT ARE ARE- BEING STOOD UP THROUGH THIS PROCESS- HOPEFULLY- THE BUDGET WILL- WILL. PASS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURETHAT E HAVE THAT CAPABILITY TO LOOK AT REGIONAL REGIONALLY PLANNING. ANTI THOSE LOCAL GROUPS AND PUT OUR ARMS AROUND THEM. AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL. TO BETTER POSITION DOWN TO RECEIVE FUNDING FROM ALL SOURCES INCLUDING CAL FIRE SO. CAL FIRE THE CONSERVANCY'S- THE OTHER AGENCIES HAVING- GRANT PROGRAMS WE'LL ALL BE COLLABORATING WITH THOSE REGIONAL COLLABORATIVES. TO HAVE A KOBE- OUTCOME HE SAID APPROACH TO THAT. THAT WILL IMMENSELY HELP- RIDICULOUSLY THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA THAT'S BEEN KIND OF- KIND OF SPREAD OUT IN THERE- YEAH. CASSIDY TO DO THIS- BUT- WE WILL BRING THAT UNDER- THAT GROUP AND THEN CAL FIRE WILL BE A PART OF THAT AS WELL AS OUR OUR- SISTER APARTMENT IN AGENCIES. IN MAKING SURE THAT WE GET MONEY TO WHERE THE NEED IS FOR THE NEW THAT I DON'T. THANK YOU THAT THE CHIEF PORTER AND- FOR THE END THERE GOING FOR THAT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BELOW MORE IN. OR RIP BUT IF WE CAN FIND SOME WAY. TO HAVE OF CODE. STATE WHY HARDENING. THAT'S OF MATCH ALONG WITH SOME THE ACRE GOALS AND GIVE OUR OF THE SOME GOAL NOT TO THROUGH AN ONLY PUBLIX. I THINK THAT COULD HELP DIRECTOR STRATEGY HERE'S BUT SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS IN THEIR FLEXIBILITY AND THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY IT WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE ON THESE TO REGIONAL. REGIONAL APPROACHES TO THE FIRE ISSUE SO THANKS. SENATOR DOLLY YOU'RE A NICE DETERMINANT ALL THE START OFF WITH THE- FOLLOW UP ON THE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE TAXES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION- IN THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION FROM GEORGIA WHICH IS ONE TIME FINDINGS- WHICH I TAKE TO SOMETHING WE NEED TO ADDRESS FOR. ITS SHOULD BE ONGOING FUNDING IN MY OPINION BUT WHAT I HAD A QUESTION ON HOW MANY ACRES- WITH THIS FUNDING TREAT. AT RESEARCH AGENCY. WARM CAL FIRED FIFTY WHO WOULD LIKE TO- RESPOND. SENATOR DOLLY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND- I CAN GIVE YOU SOME SORT OF BROAD PARAMETERS BUT I THINK IT ACTUALLY GETS BACK TO KIND OF THE EARLIER CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING I'M SO YOU KNOW THERE'S YOU WORK BACK AND BACK OF THE ENVELOPE ESTIMATE IS THAT IT'S ABOUT JUDGE THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ACRE- ON AVERAGE AND- AND SO THIS COULD TREAT IN TOTAL NINE ONE YEAR BUT IN TOTAL WITH THESE DOLLARS AS THEY- GET EXECUTED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES- THAT BITE AGAIN THAT IS A VERY ROUGH. BALLPARK AND IT ACTUALLY GETS INTO SOME OF THESE MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS MEDITATION TREATMENT PROGRAM- SAYS- VERSUS HOW WOULD THESE DOLLARS BE SPENT INTO REGIONAL STRATEGIES FOR EXAMPLE ARE FORCED HEALTH GRANT DOLLARS- ARE COMING INTO COMMUNITIES- AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE TREATING ACRE SOMETIMES ARE MOVING BUDGET YEAH INVASIVE SPECIES OUR FIRE PREVENTION GRANT DOLLARS EACH YEAR- SOMETIMES THOSE ARE TREATING ACRES WITH STRATEGIC SHE'LL BREAK SOMETIMES. THOSE ARE GOING INTO EDUCATION OUTREACH- AND HELPING COMMUNITIES ON THAT MORE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND HOME GARDENING SO HE'S- GRANT DOLLARS BY VIRTUE OF BEING FAIRLY BROAD AREN'T NECESSARILY A LITERAL ONE PER ONE TRANSLATION OF BENCH MANAGEMENT VERSES. FIRST NAME I'M DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND SOME OF THESE OTHER INVESTMENTS- ANOTHER POINT I WANTED TO MAKE ON SENATOR STERN'S EARLIER QUESTION IS REALLY HOW CRITICAL THESE ARE EIGHT BEAST REGIONAL STRATEGIES ARE TO JUST UNDERSCORE WHAT SHE WAS SAYING THAT THE GOAL IS FOR THE REGIONAL STRATEGIES TO BAND DIRECTOR R. GRANT DOLLARS AND THESE BROAD GRAND BUCKETS. INTO THE PRIORITIES THAT THE REGION IS IDENTIFYING WHICH INCLUDES HOME HARDENING AND- IN THE FUTURE WE ABSOLUTELY DO YOU WANT TO SCALE UP HOME HARDENING BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE DIRECT ASSISTANCE ON HOME GARDENING. IS A NEW PROGRAM THAT MISSTATES A PROGRAM THAT I WE ARE LONG THIS YEAR THIS THE FIRST TIME. IT IS GETTING UNDER AND SO ARE PART A HOW MILLION DOLLARS. TO BE ABLE TO. THE MODEL AND THEN SCALE IT. SO EVENTUALLY WE WANT TO SEE IF I MANAGE AND- HARDENING. INTO. SEEING SO. I'M CONCERNED THAT WHAT THE HELL WE'RE GONNA TRACK IT NOW WE'RE GOING TO SEE OUR OUTCOMES IS GONNA BE CRITICAL FOR THE FUTURE WITH IT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO SO WOULD IS THERE SOME- DATA POINTS IN. THE PART IN THIS POLICY THAT ALLOWS US TO FIGURE OUT AND BE ABLE TO TRACK WORLD. WE'RE ALL THESE BUCKETS OF. RESOURCES ARE GOING AND THEN SO LATER ON WE CAN LOOK BACK. AND GO THIS MUCH WENT TO HOME HARDENING THIS MUCH WENT TWO. ACRES TREATED THIS TO THIS TOOK CARE OF THIS COMMUNITY FOR WHAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS ARE SO I JUST WANTED. MAKE A NOTE- THAT I WOULD. WE BUY REMAKE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT IN THERE SO THAT WE CAN COME BACK AND ANALYZE LATER BECAUSE WE KNOW- THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN WILDFIRE AREAS AND EVEN IN THAT THE DROUGHT STUFF TOO. BUT WE GOT A WE NEED A MECHANISM TO COME BACK IN AND BE ABLE TO TRACK WHERE EVERYTHING WENT IN AND WHERE WE GET THE BEST BANG FOR BUCK AND WHERE DID IT RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK. YOU KNOW FUTURE- WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF- A LOT MORE NEEDS. AND TO FIND OUT WHICH PROGRAMS WORK WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. ABSOLUTELY SENATOR DOLLY AND- AND WE ARE TRACKING IT- EVEN THOUGH THE GRANT APPLICATIONS ARE VERY BROAD AND COMMUNITIES CAN ASK FOR WHAT THEY NEED- WE ARE TRACKING WHERE THESE DOLLARS ARE GOING IN WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DEPTH AND ALSO. USE SPEECH AND TRACKING WHERE THEY ARE GOING ON THE LANDSCAPE AND WHAT IS YOUR STREET AND WHAT IS DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND THEN ALSO IN THIS BUDGET IS FIFTEEN MILLION PER SPECIAL ADD DATA ACQUISITION SO THAT WE CAN NOT ONLY TRACK RESPECTIVELY WHAT WE'RE DOING. BUT BUT MONITOR IT AS WELL YOU SHOULD. GET THE MOST REFINED MODELS IMPROVE OUR DATA LAYERS SO THAT WE ARE SEEING THE IMPACT ON THE LANDSCAPE ON THE WATERSHED- BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE INVESTING IN YOUR ACTION FOR. FOREST HEALTH UP IN HIGH SIERRA FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS ALSO IMPROVING OUR WATERSHED RESILIENCE AND BIODIVERSITY AND EXPANDING ALL THESE OF COURSE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AS WELL SO WHEN WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO BE TRACKING YOUR STREET AND WHERE THEY ARE AND WHO'S DOING WHAT WITH THESE. THESE DOLLARS- BUT WE WILL ALSO BE- INVESTING IN IMPROVING OUR MODELING SO THAT WE CAN. TRACK BETTER MONITORING SO THAT WE CAN BETTER ARTICULATE WHEN WE ARE MAKING AN INVESTMENT OF COURSE TELL HOW IT'S ALSO INVESTING NOT ONLY IN COMMUNITY SAFETY AND WILDFIRES LATE BUT ALSO IMPROVING WATERSHED HEALTH AND- AND MITIGATING DROUGHT CONSEQUENCES. THANK YOU. NOW ONE OF TO GO TO A NINETY WHICH IS WATER RESILIENT PACKAGE WHICH IS FOUR POINT THREE BILLION- WE HAVE ONE BILLION DIRECTLY RELATED TO WATER SUPPLIERS IN ITS WELCOME STEP FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE DEBT BACKLOG BUT IT WON'T SOLVE THE REVENUE PROBLEM UNLESS THE MORATORIUM IS LIFTED- IN HERE WE KNOW THAT TO SENATOR DODD HAS SP NINE NINE EIGHT WHICH PROTECTS CUSTOMERS FROM SHUT OFFS. FOR AT LEAST SIXTY DAYS AND REQUIRES PAYMENTS THE PAYMENT PLAN TO BE OFFERED THAT REMOVING THE MORATORIUM WILL NOT RE RESULT IN IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF SERICES SO FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DOES THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. IS THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN TO LIFT THE MORATORIUM ON WATER SHUTOFFS. A THIRD PARTY FINANCING FOR SAVING WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON ON THAT QUESTION. OKAY WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE ELIGIBILITY FOR CRITERIA WILL BE APPLIED FOR THE ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDS. WE HAVE A- CALLING FROM- WATER BORDER PULL HUMANS WHO COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE ONE BILLION WATER REGIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU SERGIO UNDERPLAYING SOME DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER. WE'RE WORKING THROUGH- THE CRITERIA NOW AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS HOW TO. HELP ADDRESS YOUR REGS THAT WATER SYSTEMS I THINK FOR. ACTIVE THERE'S TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED PLUS WATER SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA SO IT'S A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF THE BULK OF THOSE ARE REALLY SMALL OVER HALF OF THOSE ARE UNDER. A THOUSAND CONNECTIONS- AND- AS WE GO THE CRITERIA WERE. GOING TO OUR TO FIGURE. OUT- WHAT THEY'RE LOSS. MAY HAVE BEEN TRY TO UNDER. THE ORIGINAL THEY DO SAY PRESENTLY. ARE AND TRYING DECIDE THAT BOTH ALLOWS THEM. QUICKLY I RECEIVED SOME ASSISTANCE.WITH THE LOSS OF REVENUE THAT DAVE US SEEN THAT CAN IMPACT OF THE- CODE THAT. AND MOVE FORWARD INTO. A BETTER POSITION. FROM THAT NOW WE BE ABLE TO ADDRESS EVERY RIDGES EXACTLY AS YOU ARE SYNCING IT PROBABLY NOT NOT IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A FAST PROGRAM. AND I'LL BE ABLE TO BRING THAT TO BEAR SUCH THAT. WOULD GET THEM ON ON BETTER FOOTING THAN THEY ARE NOW. AND MOVE MOVE FORWARD IN THAT FASHION. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT. INFORMATION BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO REPRESENT A LOT OF SMALL DISHES I'D FIRST LIKE THE I DON'T THINK THERE'S GONNA BE ENOUGH FUNDS TO. PICK UP THE BACK DEBT AND AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE THAT. THE COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICTS IN WATER PROVIDERS HAVE NO ABILITY UNDER PROP TWO EIGHTEEN TO BE ABLE TO RAISE REVENUE SO WE- DO THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR TOOK A- STANCE TO ALLOW PEOPLE NOT TO PAY THEIR BILL. AND NOW WE'RE THANKFULLY WE HAVE SOME SOME RESOURCES COMING IN FROM THE- A. A. A. R. P. A. WHICH ALLOWS US TO DO TO HELP IN THAT IN THIS SITUATION BUT THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS. THAT IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES TO GO AROUND. AND PEOPLE ARE STILL ALLOWED NOT TO PAY THEIR BILL WITHOUT BEING SHUT OFF FROM THE WATER AND EVEN THE DOT PLAN ALLOW SIXTY DAYS- WE STILL HAVE A PROBLEM SO I WOULD I'M REQUESTING MORE DETAIL ON HOW WE ROLL THIS PLAN OUT BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S GONNA BE ENOUGH MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF THAT. EVERYBODY THAT'S IN THE REAR H. AND WE'RE STILL FACED WITH THE PROBLEM AFTER WE PAY THE BILL SO. IF SOMEBODY CAN GET THAT BACK TO ME I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO HAVE THAT MUCH DETAIL TODAY BUT IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL- BECAUSE THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY AND WE'RE GONNA BE HERE IN THE FUTURE. THE. AND LASTLY MR TERRIFIED COULD ASK ONE LAST QUESTION OF THE COMMITTEE. YEAH PRETTY THOROUGH WE'RE GONNA BE VOTING ON THE. PART A AND PART B. AND THEN THERE'S. I GUESS THE ISSUE NINETY THROUGH. NINETY THREE TWO THREE THIS CAN BE HELD OPEN AND IT'S GOING TO GO TO. A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. BETWEEN THE SENATE ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS THAT CORRECT. YES SO WHERE DOES THE PUBLIC GET A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN THIS IS THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN BUT THEY HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE DETAILS OF HOW WHAT COMES OUT OF THAT CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. WILL THERE BE A PUBLIC HEARING AT THE SENATE LEVEL SO THAT DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING ON NOW WITH ALL THE PARTIES ON DIFFERENT ELEMENTS WERE. WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A JUNE FIFTEEN DEADLINES WERE SORT OF WORKING BACKWARDS FROM FROM THERE SO THEY'LL BE. L. B. INPUT AT THE FULL BUDGET HEARINGS AND THEN ON THE FLOOR THEY'LL BE THEY'LL BE INFERRED. BUT FOR THE PUBLIC TO ME OBVIOUSLY WE WILL GET TO WEIGH IN ON THOSE WITH AS THERE IS THIS. AFTER THAT GOES TO THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND THEN AND THEN THE BUDGET COMES OUT WHERE IS THE PUBLIC HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. WELL THESE THESE THESE THESE ITEMS ARE ARE LEFT OPEN AND THEY'RE GONNA GO TO THE CONFERENCE ORDERS AGAIN NOT GOING TO BE A DECISION TODAY. ON THESE ITEMS CORRECT. THIS IS MY FIRST EVER GOLD EXCEPT FOR THE YES THE DOLLAR AMOUNT TO THE ACTUAL CATEGORIES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE AND WE ARE TAKING CARE OF THE ACTIONS. THAT WE'RE TAKING. YOU KNOW ON THE- PHONE FOR INSTANCE ON THE CLIMATE IS THAT WEIRD WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AN ACTION TO. HAVE THE SENATE ANY MYSTERY ADMINISTRATIONS RESILIENCY PACKAGE APPROVED AT THREE POINT SIX SEVEN FIVE BILLION. BUT THE DETAILS AND THE DISCREPANCIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I HAVE TO BE FIGURED OUT AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE JUNIOR BUDGET AND THE BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE SO WE MAY NOT GET THE ACTUAL CATEGORIES DOWN WE MAY BE COMING BACK AFTER JUNE FIFTEENTH IN THIS COMMITTEE. TO WORK OUT SOME OF THE OTHER PROPOSALS ON THE DETAILS SO WE MAY HAVE A DOLLAR AMOUNT. THAT WE THAT WE END ON BUT THE PROGRAMMING IT'S A FLUID SITUATION CENTER. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE UNDER UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY FOR ME BUT FOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL. THAT IF WE'RE GONNA ADOPT A BUDGET. BY JUNE FIFTEENTH THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WE KNOW THAT. AND THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE. THEN WE pAND SPEND SOME OF THAT HAS DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND THEN THOSE CATEGORIES MAYBE MOVED AROUND WITH THE PUBLIC DOESN'T HAVE A POINT OF OPPORTUNITY THAT POINT UNLESS THERE'S A TRAILER BILL THAT COMES THROUGH- AND IT'S BEEN IT'S NOT IF IT'S NOT HEARD IN A COMMITTEE. THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO COMMENT IF IT'S HURTING THE COMMITTEE THEY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY I MEAN AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS PUBLIC HEARING AND WHAT WE TRY TO PRESENT AT LEAST THE PACKAGES WITH THE COLUMNS SO AT LEAST HE'S TRYING TO MAKE IT EASIER OTHERS WE GOT THE BUDGET JUST LIKE. EVERYBODY GOT THE BUDGET MORE TRYING TO POLICE IN THIS COMMITTEE CREATE THE COLUMN SO PEOPLE KNOW WHICH HAPPENS IN JANUARY WHAT DID THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED WHAT DID THE SENATE PROPOSAL LOOKS LIKE SO AT LEAST. YOU SEE. IT WAS BE TRUE YOUR CRAP WE WON'T KNOW EXACT AHLERS FOR DELETION OF THE DISCREPANCIES OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST I MEAN FOR ME I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU GUYS BEEN DOING THIS A LOT LONGER BUT- IT'S BEEN OVERWHELMING TO TRY TO KEEP TRACK OF. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS BEING. ALLOCATED AND SPENT AND IF WE HAD THE EARLY ACTION NOW WE'VE GOT THE NOW WE'RE DOING THE REGULAR BUDGET AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR THE PUBLIC TO FIGURE OUT I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY WATER AGENCIES HAVE CALLED ME AND ASKED ME YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO GET SOME DETAIL TODAY SO IF I CAN'T IF I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY TRACKING IT TO SOMEBODY THAT'S IN THE KNOW AND- SO IT'S SOMEWHAT IN THE KNOW HERE I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR. THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING ALLOCATED ACROSS THE BOARD WHETHER IT'S- NOT JUST THE- THE- THINGS THAT WERE CHARGD WITH BUT THE OTHER COMMITTEES THAT ARE DOING FINE IN. THE SUB ONES INTO THE OTHER SUBCOMMITTEES. I MEAN THERE'S JUST A LOT OF RESOURCES BEING MOVED AROUND CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW AND I. HAVE NO DOUBT AND I TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOOK AT CENTER DR FORGOT TO SAY THAT ONCE THE CONFERENCE. COMMITTEE ACTION IS TAKEN. THAT WILL COME BACK TO THE FULL BUDGET WE WON'T NECESSARILY HEAR IT HERE I DON'T THINK THERE'S- THE PLAN IS IT WILL BE AT THE- AT THE FULL BUDGET. AND IT WILL BE. SEVEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO WE'LL ALL BE IN THERE WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT. THE ELEMENTS THAT WE AGREE ON AND THE ELEMENTS THAT WE MOVED TO BUDGET YOU IN YOUR OR SOMETHING SO THERE'S- THERE'S THIS HEARING THERE'S A FULL BUDGET HEARING AND THEN THERE'S A CONFERENCE HERE SO THERE WILL BE. IT IS FLUID AND IT'S A LOT NO DOUBT. THANK YOU. ARE ARE YOU. OKAY SO I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION I THINK MR YOUR BURL- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WE SEE IN THE GOVERNOR'S TRIAL PACKAGE- FORWARD DEPARTMENT WHERE RESOURCES THE ORVILLE PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT IN MY UNDERSIDE VISITED TO PUMP STORAGE FACILITIES BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT'S AN ENERGY- PUB ELEMENT NOT A TROUT OR RESILIENCY DOESN'T PRODUCE ANY MORE WATER IN A PUMPED STORAGE SPA FACILITY. FINE INVESTMENT AND THIS MAY BE THE RIGHT PLACE TO DO IT COULD YOU COMMENT ON. THE THAT OBSERVATION OR SOMEBODY HAD RESOURCES. SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IT ALL BECAUSE FOR A SECOND AND SEE IF- WHEN MY RESOURCES HOLLINGS HAS A COMMON FIRST AND THEN ALL I CAN FOLLOW ON. SIX IT IT'S SNOWED HERE GETS A CALL AND ANYBODY ON THE LIST AND YOU'RE LUCKY IN A LUCKY ONE- TEMPE OUR PROPERTIES. I CAN SEE WHETHER THAT THE CANAL REPAIRS WILL STOP LEAKAGE AND STOP WATER FROM SEEPING. LEAVE LEAVING THE CHANNEL SO THAT. CREATES MORE WATER PRINT- SO TO SPEAK BUT THE PUMP STORAGE PER SE I DON'T SEE HOW THAT HELPS OUR DROUGHT. GO AHEAD. HELLO I CAN I CAN TALK A BIT ABOUT THE PROJECT THERE AND SO- YES THIS PROJECT WOULD ALLOW FOR PUMPED STORAGE OPERATIONS AT THE ORACLE FACILITY. IN THE IN THE REAL BENEFIT THE PUBLIC BENEFIT. THAT WOULD ACCRUE THERE HE IS REALLY SUPPORTING ENERGY GRID- SUPPORTING THE- WHICH IN TURN HELPS SUPPORT THE CLAIM REJECTED IN THE STATE SO. THERE IS A BIG ENERGY COMPONENT THAT IS THE MAIN. BENEFICIARY OF THOSE PUB ON STORAGE OPERATIONS. OKAY THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION ON. WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT ON ON THE TRIAL DEMONSTRATES THE DROP PACKAGE WERE I'M GOING IN ON THE AGRICULTURAL WATER EFFICIENCY. THE SENATE PROPOSAL HAS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION VERSUS THE GOVERNOR HAS SIXTY MILLION AND I. TRYING TO WEIGH THE DIFFERENT DISTINCTION BETWEEN IMMEDIATE BENEFITS IT'S FOUR IN THE IN THE AGRICULTURAL FIELD INTO THE STATE WITH THESE WITH SWEEP INVESTMENTS VERSUS LONG TERM- INVESTMENTS AND I WAS HOPING THAT. THAT SOMEBODY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF. AGRICULTURE COULD WERE WATER RESOURCES. IS WE'RE LOOKING TO AS A DROUGHT PACKAGE IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S A VALUE IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR TO GET IMMEDIATE SAVINGS ANY MEDIA. REALIZATION OF- MORE WATER BY INVESTING IN WATER EFFICIENCIES. YES THANK YOU SENATOR- I'M RETURNING I'M NOT GONNA SAY KERR FOUND THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE NECK YEAH. I CAN TAKE YOUR QUESTION ON SWEEP STREETS UNDER THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING INNOVATION- SO THESE ARE PROJECTS TAKING A BATH FROM TWELVE. TO SIXTEEN MONTHS TO PUT ON. TWO MORE FROM MY FLAT FRA REGAUGED TEN TWENTY. WELL EFFICENT IRRIGATION SYSTEM ARE USING MACROS BANKERS TRIP AWESOME SUBDISTRICT VERIFICATION. SO THAT IS UP HERE WE HAD OUR IMPLEMENTATION THAT TAKES PLACE BUT ONCE THOSE SYSTEMS I'M PLACE IT'S SUCH A USUALLY THE SYSTEM TIME PLACE FOR YOU KNOW TEN YEARS OR LONGER AND SO THERE IS CONSIDERABLE WATER SAVINGS OVER THAT TIME SENATOR. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT IF IT DOES TAKE SIXTY MONTHS THE SENATE'S PROPOSING FOUR TIMES AS MUCH INVESTMENT AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF. THERE'S PLENTY OF A LEAK HERE AT- INEFFICIENT FARMS THAT COULD USE THIS MONEY TO YOU KNOW SAVE SOME WATER STRETCH OUT THE WATER THAT THEY HAVE SAVE SOME OF THEIR CROPS IF WE HAVE AN ACUTE. DROUGHT SITUATION WE'RE NOT TECHNICALLY IN A TRUCK NOW BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT NEXT YEAR WILL BRING AND IT JUST SEEMS AS THOUGH WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE WOULD WANT TO PUT. MORE MONEY INTO THIS CATEGORY IN AGRICULTURE AI DON'T REPRESENT ANY CHARACTER CULTURE I'M JUST SAYING BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A WISE INVESTMENT. GIVEN WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND I GUESS THE QUESTION IS RHETORICAL IS WHY NOT MORE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO DO. TO DEAL WITH THE SECURITY. CONCERN. THIRD DRIVER FROM PARKING BY ANTHOLOGIST- MAYBE JUMP IN HERE AND JUST TO CLARIFY SO UNDER MINISTRATION PROPOSAL THERE IS ACTUALLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR SWEET THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE SEEING THE SIXTY MILLION THAT WAS IT THE ADDITIONAL MAY REVISION INVESTMENT BUT THERE WAS FORTY MILLION THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- AND THEN AS A FOOTNOTE IN US FOOTNOTE E. PRINT TO SEE SMALL E. ON OUR ON PAGE NINETY NINE THE VERY GOOD THANK YOU. THIS IS. EARNING YOUR PAY TODAY. GOOD YEAH AND THEN JUST ANOTHER QUICK NOTE TO ADD SO AS PART OF THE DROUGHT PACKAGE ONE THING YOU ALSO- WE'LL SEE IN THE FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. IS SPECIFIC AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL THERE'S ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THERE. TO HAVE- CDFA- HEROES SUPPORT KIND OF IMMEDIATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE POOR- WATER EFFICIENCY CONSERVATION PLANS. TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT DROUGHT NEEDS AND- YOU SEE IF THEY COULD SPEAK A LITTLE MORE TO THAT BUT YOU KNOW SLEEP IS ONE COMPONENT OF THE BROADER SUITE OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAVE ACROSS THE AGRICULTURE- PACKAGE AND IN THE DROUGHT PACKAGE. THAT WILL HELP US SUPPORT SO- DOCTOR IF YOU WANT TO ADD A LOT TO LOOK AT MORE OF THE DENSE DECIDE YEAH I AM A PART OF THAT ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT PART OF OUR DISCUSSION THIS IS. THE ACTION THAT WE'RE TAKING IS AS WE WORK OUT THE SENATE'S AGRICULTURAL- ANY ADMINISTRATION SUSTAINABLE WE'RE. TAKING THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX. IN DOLLARS FOR TWO THE HIGH NUMBER. WHICH WE HOPE WE GET. COLLECTED FIVE MILLION FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT GO AHEAD DR. ADD THANK YOU SUGGEST AND THAT YES THANK. OF COURSE YEP I'M I'M NEEDED YET THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR SO- WE HAVE- WE WOULD BE STARTING A NEW PROGRAM I KNEEL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. FEATURING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO IRRIGATION SYSTEMS WE FIND THAT THIS IS A MUCH NEEDED- A RESOURCE BECAUSE ONCE FOLKS GET THESE IRRIGATION SYSTEMS ARE THERE ARE CERTAIN CHECKS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN TO MAKE THEM- OPERATE IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER FOR EXAMPLE. ARE THERE IS OUR- CONCEPT CAR DISTRIBUTION UNIFORMITY IN MAKING SURE THAT THE WATER IS JUST RUDE EQUALLY THROUGHOUT THE FIELD. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IF THAT DISTRIBUTION WAS AN EVEN. YOU'D BE WASTING WATER IN ONE PLACE THE FIELD WAS SINCE I ENVISIONED THE IRRIGATION THE WHOLE FIELD SO- THESE ARE TESTS THAT THE TEST FOR DISTRIBUTION UNIFORMITY. THAT IS NEEDED FOR. BOMBS AND THEIR- TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AT THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND AT THE UNIVERSITY THAT I ABLE TO DO THESE. ARMY ALSO HAVE WHAT WE CALL MORE BY LOCATION LABS OPERATING THROUGH SOME OF THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS. SOME OF THESE FANS WILL CERTAINLY GO TO KEEP UP THOSE MORE BY LABS THEN THEY MOVE AROUND WITHIN THE STATE- ARE THAT DISTRICT TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS SO. IT'S A MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES WITH THE DROUGHT- THAT MORE BY LOCATION RABBITS HAVEN'T BEEN FUNDED ON A- NOT TIME BASE- AND THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSENTS THAT I'M KEEPING THEM GOING. MOST OF THESE SERVICES ARE PRETTY CHEAP- BUT- YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY CROWD WAS SO NECESSARY KIND OF FULL OF THEM- BECAUSE OF ALL THE OTHER COSTS THAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH. RIGHT NOW I MEAN I'M IN AND THAT SORT OF UNDERSCORES THE POINT I MEAN IT'S GREAT TO SEND OUT THE PROFESSOR TO HELP THE FARMER WITH THE EFFICIENCY PROGRAM BUT- THE STATE SENATE HAS FOUR TIMES AS MUCH MORE MONEY INTO THE ACTUAL. APPARATUS THAT THEY HAVE TO BUY ME ONE SHE IS ONE THING IS TEACHING THE FARMER HOW TO RUN THE SYSTEM BUT IT'S ANOTHER HOW DO WE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THAT WITH THESE WATER EFFICIENCY USES SO. LIKE TO HAVE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION TAKE A LOOK AT THAT- WITH THESE WHAT YOU KNOW YES WE NEED TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON TOP OF THE DEBTS. BUDGET DOESN'T FIVE MILLION BUCKS COMPARED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR THE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE TO RUN- THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. JUMPING AROUND WHICH WE DO BECAUSE WE CAN ISSUE NUMBER NINETY THREE IF WE HAVE DIRECTOR BOTTOMS. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THE SENATE HAS IN THEIR PROPOSAL WITH DID- FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO PROTECT FISH AND WILDLIFE. FROM CHANGING CONDITIONS. WHAT MIGHT WE- WITH THAT TYPE OF INVESTMENT WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE PROTECTION. COUPLED WITH THE WATERSHED AND THE OTHER- WETLAND INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING. OUR CLIMATE. SENATOR JUST LET ME CONFIRM. AS SOMEONE CHECK ON HIM ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT ISSUE NINETY THREE SENATE CLIMATE PACKAGE ON PAGE ONE TWELVE AND- AGENDA CORRECT CORRECT THE SENATE WOULD PROPOSE TO GIVE THE FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IT'S THE BEST VERSION IS NOT GIVING IN ORDER TO HAVE THE W. C. B. PROTECT FISH AND WILDLIFE IN RESPONSE TO DROUGHT FIRE AND START CHANGING CLIMATE AND WHAT TYPE OF. WHAT MIGHT WE EXPECT WITH THAT TYPE OF INVESTMENT IN THE CLIMATE- RESILIENCY ARENA. BRUNSKILL POSITIVE CHANGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN CALIFORNIA. TO GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES. OF PROJECTS THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD PRESENTLY OPERATES. AND THE BENEFIT OF INVESTING IN THE BOARD IS IT HAS EXISTING PERSONNEL AND PROGRAMS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF DISPERSING FUNDS. RELATIVELY QUICKLY INTO THE FIELD. SOME ARENAS INCLUDING STREAMFLOW ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM WHICH WAS CREATED FIRST UNDER PROPOSITION ONE. IT INVESTS AND WATER EFFICIENCIES RESERVOIR RE OPERATIONS PURCHASE OR LONG TERM LEASE CONJUNCTIVE USE PROGRAMS ALL OF WHICH REQUIRE A DEMONSTRABLE INCREASE IN STREAM FLOW THE BENEFIT OF FISH MY LIFE AS A CONDITION FOR SITTING TO THE GRANT. AND THERE AND CHARLIE VOLUNTARILY KIND OF CREATED COLLABORATIVE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE RURAL LANDSCAPE URBAN LANDSCAPES WELL. TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE AND ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE GOVERNORS MAY REVISION. IT IS A PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD FOR WILDLIFE CROSSING. AND FISH PASSAGE PROJECTS WE KNOW IN TIMES OF WATER SCARCITY. WHAT ANIMALS NEED IS THE FREEDOM TO ROAM WE KNOW THAT INFRASTRUCTURE CAN PROHIBIT THAT ROLE PLAYING BANK CULVERTS IN COASTAL STREAMS THAT PROHIBITS SALMON MIGRATION UPSTREAM OR THANK. HIGHWAYS THAT PROHIBIT ABOUT LIONS YOU KNOW ACCESSING HABITAT CORRIDORS. SO I THINK THAT'S A MARQUEE ASPECT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT'S AN EXISTING PROGRAM AND A LOT LESS CONSERVATION BOARD. AND MORE BROADLY LIKE THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL WHICH IS ALWAYS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL RECEIVED WEAPONS RESTRICTED FUNDING. THE W. C. B. ITSELF RUNS WETLAND RESTORATION FUNDING PROGRAMS UP AND DOWN THE COAST. OKAY I'VE DUG DIRECTOR DONNELLY WITH THE W. C. B. I THINK YOU'RE ON THE LINE SOMEWHERE COULD YOU. WE END ON THIS- IN IT WE HAVE INFORMATION THAT SHOWS THAT WE NEED TO DOA TWELVE TO FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE WILDLIFE WHAT OUR- FISH AND WILDLIFE- AREAS IN THIS IS A HALF A BILLION SO IT'S NOT YOU KNOW IT'S A- A TWENTY FIFTH OF WHAT THE INVESTMENT NEEDS TO CALL BUT- LET'S FOCUS ON THE FISH AND- THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. DIRECTOR DONNELLY IF YOU'RE THERE I AM HERE. TO CARE. SO WHAT WHAT RESULTS WE GET IF WE IF THIS IS IF THE- ASSEMBLY AND THE S. AND THE GOVERNOR AGREE FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR. INVESTMENT WHAT MIGHT WE- ANTICIPATE THAT INITIALLY WHAT TYPE OF IMPROVEMENTS WE E. WE MAKE TO THE- ON THE GROUND. LAST YEAR JUST IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE. THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. PROTECTING NEARLY FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES STATEWIDE- SO WE'VE GOT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK THROUGH- RESTORATION ENHANCEMENT INDOOR CONSERVATION EASEMENT ANOTHER AREA THAT WE'RE WORKING AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO BE WORKING AND IS WORKING ON NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS WE HAVE- WE WORK IT WE'VE WORKED WITH SEVERAL- FARMERS RANCHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOT ONLY TO ENHANCE AND IMPROVE WATER RESOURCES AND WATER INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE PROPERTY TO SECURE ENHANCED WATER. FLOWING ACROSS THE LAND. CONSERVATION EASEMENTS TO PROTECT NOT ONLY IN THE WILDLIFE HABITAT THAT THOSE FARMS AND RANCHES PROJECT. BUT ALSO AND MAKING SURE THAT THE ECONOMIC STABILITY OF THOSE FARMS AND RANCHES CAN CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE- THE OTHER THING ADD DIRECTOR BONHAM ALSO MENTIONED OUR WORK IN THAT WILDLIFE. CORRIDOR AND FISH PASSAGE ARENA YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'VE KERR ADDED JUST AT OUR LAST BOARD MEETING LAST WEEK WE FIND IT I BELIEVE THREE PLANNINGPROJECTS. TO HELP BRING CORRIDOR PROJECTS. WE'RE GONNA COME BACK AND POTENTIALLY INVEST THE FINAL DOLLARS INTO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE CROSSINGS AND ANSWERS PASSAGE PROJECTS ARE SUCCESSFUL- IN ADDITION WE HAVE A WORKING WITH FARMS AND RANCHES AGAIN. WE HAVE A MONARCH BUTTERFLY AND POLLINATOR HABITAT PROGRAM THAT IS SIGNIFICANT AND THAT IS A CHANGING CLIMATE. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF A WARMING CLIMATE AND WHERE THOSE ARE AND THEN INVEST IN THOSE AREAS WHERE WE ANTICIPATE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT SINCE. UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND IDENTIFYING AREAS IN CALIFORNIA OR WE SHOULD INVEST OUR DOLLARS TO HELP THOSE POLLINATOR HABITAT. FOR MONARCH BUTTERFLIES NECK. OKLAHOMA SENATOR THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I'D BE HAPPY TO GO MORE IN DEPTH IF YOU LOOK- I'M SURE IF WE COME UP WITH FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WE WILL MOVE THE COIN. IN DEPTH QUITE A BIT AND I WOULD BE REMISS WITHOUT RECOGNIZING MY COLLEAGUES THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS I THINK WHEN WE REPORTED OUT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAS SOUGHT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN WORKING LANDS. ONLY TO HAVE IT NOT IN THE FINAL PACKAGE BUT IT HASN'T BEEN FROM A LACK. OF ENTHUSIASM SINISTER AND YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP ON THIS AREA. WHEN I JUST LET MY ENTHUSIASM IN AND APPRECIATE THAT THE CHAIR- AND THE COMMITTEE RAISING THE BAR ON THIS. THIS FISH AND WILDLIFE PROTECTION PEACE AND ESPECIALLY UTILIZING THE W. C. B. WHICH I THINK IS PROVING ITSELF AS IT. EFFECTIVE ARM OF. OF US YOU KNOW T. R. A. AND SEE IF W. IN IN GETTING THIS WORK DONE IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE THERE'S THAT MUCH OF A DISTANCE. THE SUM OF ITS IN THE CATEGORIZATION SO THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. MAYBE IT MAYBE IS NOT IN. IN ON EXACTLY CATEGORIZE THE SAME WAY BUT- BUT I SENT. I'M GETTING AN INTENT FROM FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT- THERE'S A WILLINGNESS TO MOVE THIS FUNDING. IF WE IF WE APPROPRIATE THESE KIND OF DOLLARS. THROUGH THE W. C. B. AND MAKE THIS KIND OF AUGMENTATION DO I HAVE THAT THEY'RE RIGHT. SENATOR LIKE YOU I'M- Q. CHAMPION FOR WILDLIFE CROSSING AND FISH PASSAGE PROJECTS I DO THINK THOSE PROJECTS ARE BOTH CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND DROUGHT WATER RESILIENCY PROJECTS. UNATTRACTIVE ASPECT OF INVESTING IN THE W. C. T. B. AS IT'S A KNOWN ENTITY. ACROSS THE STATE WITH A LONG TRACK RECORD. FOR WHICH- BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY HAVE STAFF IS IT BUYS REMEMBERS. AND THE GRANT MAKING AND- PROJECT INVESTMENT IS DONE IN A PUBLIC PUBLIC FORUM. SO I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THE SENATE PROPOSAL IDENTIFIES THE W. C. B. AS AN ACTION AGENT AND I THINK IT'S EQUALLY GRANT. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE DOES AS WELL. AND I THINK THAT BODES WELL FOR THE FUTURE. THANKS FOR THAT DIRECTOR BOTTOM END MR DONNELLY. MISTER CHAIR ARE YOU ARE YOU MOVING ON PAST NINETY THREE WE WRAP IT UP HERE I WAS GONNA HAVE I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION I WANT TO SEE IF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHOE SHOP WITH THE STATE COASTAL COMMISSION FOR POINT OF CLARIFICATION- WE HAVE THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. WHICH IS MY UNDERSTANDING IS NOT PART OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION- AT LEAST FOR JURISDICTION AND WE HAVE. A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE CAR- COASTAL PROTECTION ACT WHICH IS NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE UNDER THE SENATE'S CLIMATE PACKAGE. HIS LITTLE CARVE OUT FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY WETLANDS I GUESS TWO HUNDRED MILLION- IF. DIRECTOR SHUSHA COULD TALK ABOUT THE- THEN THE KNEES ON THE ON THE COAST VERSUS THE NEED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY OR IF I'M CORRECT ABOUT THAT NOT BEING INCLUDED IN THAT FUNDING PACKAGE. OR ANYBODY FROM THE COASTAL COMMISSION. WHAT I'M SAYING COSA CONSERVANCY I'M LOOKING AT THE COASTAL COMMISSION SKEWS ME YEAH THIS IS RACHEL IT WAS WITH THE LA A WHILE THE COASTAL AGENCIES ARE FIGURING OUT HOW TO RESPOND JUST JUST A POINT OF CLARIFICATION THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY COVERS THE WHOLE COAST INCLUDING THE SF BAY. BUT THEN FROM A REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE THE COASTAL COMMISSION IS JUST ALONG THE COAST NOT THE BAY AND B. C. D. C. FORM THAT COVERS THE REGULATORY FUNCTION WITHIN THE BAY SO THE CONSERVANCY IS ALL CLOSED ALL DAY- BUT THEN THE REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE A LITTLE BIT SPLIT. VERY GOOD- OKAY I THIS IS A FIRST FOR THE- SUB TO. IT HAS MORE QUESTIONS WILL GO BACK TO SENATOR SIR BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A PAUSE. THE CENTERS ARE DIRECT ADVICE. ON THINGS EVEN THOUGH THEN SORRY FOR RUINING YOUR GONNA IS YOU'RE GONNA END EARLY I JUST I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND I KNOW THAT- THE C. C. ON THE BUILD PROGRAMME ESPECIALLY HAS BEEN. CHAMPIONING DECARBONISATION IN THE BUILDING SECTOR WANT TO SEE IF THEY WERE AVAILABLE SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING THAT ISSUE NINETY THREE HERE- ON ON WHAT THE HUNDRED MILLION OR MORE COULD DO. ON BUILDING DECARBONIZATION IN THAT SPACE. I DON'T KNOW C. C. IS WITH US HERE. GOOD MORNING% THIS IS NATALIE LEE I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY AND AT THE CDC AND THE PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTED IN MY DIVISION- WE NEED TO SEE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. WE DO SEE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO- BRING A COMPLEMENTARY GRANT PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO SUPPORT THE INSTALLATION OF OLD SURFACES AND GREENING SOLUTIONS- THE PROPOSED PROGRAM HAS THE BENEFIT OF BEING AVAILABLE AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHERE THE BUILD PROGRAMME DOES HAVE. SOME GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS BASED ON THE FUNDING. LIMITED TO HIGHER HERE TORIES I THINK ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES RIGHT. YES TODAY GAS FUNDING UTILITIES REP OKAY GREAT WHERE WE DID THE PROPOSED PROGRAM- WE DO SEE A PRIORITIZING AREAS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING EXTREME HEAT EVENTS. AND USING THE CALIFORNIA HEAT ASSESSMENT TOOL TO SUPPORT THEIR PARTICIPATION AND WE DO WANT TO. OF COURSE OF FOLLOW AND PRIORITIZATION FOR DISADVANTAGED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AS WELL. THANKS FOR THAT THAT BE REMISS IF NOT MENTIONING ALSO THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT WHICH WE ALL VOTED ON AND LET HIS LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR AND PLUG IN THAT FOR THE FUTURE AS WELL AND WITH THAT I WILL DEFER BACK TO THE CHAIR THANK YOU. DULY NOTED TO TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FIFTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT THAT'S THERE- I GUESS THE QUESTION- JUST GENERALLY FOR THE ALLEY O. N. A FINANCING ON. ON BOTH THE GOVERNORS AND- THE SENATE PROPOSAL IS THERE ENOUGH PLANNING DOLLARS FOR THESE REGIONAL AT ADAPTATION- COLLABORATIVES WE SEE THAT THE COOPERATIVES HAVE COME IN. AND THURS THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS THAT REALLY ENOUGH ON THE PLANNING. A PORTION I GUESS CLA WHAT'S YOUR PROPOSAL. BECAUSE I GET I RECEIVED DID EVERYBODY RECEIVED A LETTER ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION FOR PLANNING. THIRD PARTY FINANCE I WILL HAVE A COLLEAGUE AT NOON TARA FROM FROM OPR BUT I THINK THAT THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS INTENDED TO BE OVER TWO YEARS I BELIEVE. AND I'VE BEEN ON TARET SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE- TO ADD TO THE PROGRAM. YES HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SNATOR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE SO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL- DOES DOES INCLUDE A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT ADAPTATION AND pWOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO LOCAL REGIONAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. RECOGNIZING MANY GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE ALREADY TAKING PLANNING ACTION AND STARTED TO IMPLEMENT PROJECTS BUT SOME COMMUNITIES JUST DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT TYPE OF TRAINING THAT IS NEEDED. THIS FINDING THAT WE PROPOSED WHICH WOULD BE A SURGEON MENTIONED- ALLOCATED OVER TWO YEARS SO WE CAN ABLE TO DO AROUND TWO ROUNDS OF FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT THOSE LOCAL REGIONAL TRAVEL AND GOVERNMENT ADAPTATION PLANNING NEEDS REALLY INTENDED TO BE THAT FOUNDATIONS SO THAT WE'RE INSURING THAT ALL COMMUNITIES AND REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP- HEADLINERS GOOD ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE PROJECTS THAT CAN THEN BE FUNDED THROUGH. SOME OF THE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVESTMENT TYPES- ART INVESTMENT ARMS PROJECTS POSTAL CENTER. STRUCK I CAN'T. TAKE IT IN SMALL QUESTIONS. A WORK I WAS TO GET TO THE THEATER OPENED I GUESS THE- PART OF IS OUR OTHER YES YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PLANNING. AN THE COLLAB SIX X. SPREAD OUT AND STABBED ONE BIG HAPPY WORLD BUT ARE THERE ENOUGH PROJECTS IN THE QUEUE FOR THE- AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THE PLANNING FOR THE- TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT THE- THAT THE- SENATE HAS PROPOSED YOU KNOW THERE'S TWO THINGS GOING ON ONE. IS THIS MONEY OUT THE DOOR WE'RE FOR FIGHTING THE CLIMATE IT'S AN URGENCY THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. AND IT'S GREATLY AND WE KNOW WE HAVE TO PLAN BUT IS THERE ENOUGH. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE ACTUAL PROJECTS EXCEED. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BUT YOU TELL ME. WELL I'M I'M MAY DIFFER TO SERGIO OR ADDING ON THAT ON THIS SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT WERE HANGING. IN THAT PROPOSAL TO GO UNDER RESOURCES BUT I WILL SAY JUST ON THE PLANNING SIDE WE CONTINUE TO SEE OVER SUBSCRIPTION RATES THAT FAR EXCEED THE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR OBTAINING FUNDING THAT WE DO HAVE ACROSS THE STATE. JUST FOR EXAMPLE AS A DATA POINT THIS IS ANECDOTAL BUT- LAST YEAR WE RAN A WILDFIRE RESILIENCY RECOVERY GRANT PROGRAM AND SOME RETURNED FUNDING FROM OUR PROPERTY FOR. FUNDING WE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WITH OVER ONE MONTH KIND OF LEAD TIME FOR APPLICATIONS BECAUSE TIS IS ONE OF THE FUNDING. WE RECEIVED APPLICATIONS. TOTALING OVER THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS SO THAT WAS WHEN YOU KNOW YOU KNOW TRYING TO DO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT TO GET WORD OUT. AND WE JUST SEE SIGNIFICANT NEED FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THIS FINDING SUPPORT. I KNOW THAT DOESN'T DIRECTLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AROUND THE PROJECTS AND THAT KIND OF THE POINT POINT SIGN. BUT JUST A NOTE ON THAT TYPE OF NEEDS THAT WE SEE FROM COMING FROM COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE SIDE MISSILES WITH. THE ELIO. RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MR CHAIR- YET THERE. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF NEED FOR PLAY. AND THERE'S ARE OF IDENTIFY PROJECTS BUT I THINK THING THAT IMPORTANT ABOUT IS- WHO ARE THE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE THE PLANS AND PROJECTS READY TO GO AND WHO ARE THOSE THAT MIGHT NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH CAPACITY AND MAYBE THAT'S AN AREA. THAT THE STATE REALLY WANTS TO FOCUS ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND- AS INTERFERING FOR CLAIM IT. I THINK THAT REALLYGETS TO A POINT THAT- THAT ALSO SPEAKS TO SENATOR DOLLIES QUESTIONS EARLIER ON THE WILDFIRE IS WHAT ARE WE PAYING FOR THIS MONEY HOW WILL THAT HOW EXACTLY WILL THE FUNDS BE SPENT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WATER REACHES. OR THAT- WELFARE FOR THIS PLANNING GRANT THERE REALLY ISN'T A STATUTORY FRAMEWORK BEING PROPOSED FOR A LOT OF THIS FUNDING IN SOME WAYS YOU'RE CONSIDERING. YOU KNOW WHEN TO QUIT WENT TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT BONDS AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT WITH THE BOND HOW MUCH LANGUAGE IS USUALLY BEHIND IT PRIORITIZING IDENTIFYING WHO'S ELIGIBLE DOES NOT. END REQUIRING A LOT OF REPORTING ON HOW THE FUNDS GET SPENT BECAUSE OF HOW THIS IS BEING PROPOSED YOU'RE NOT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF. STATUTORY BACK BACKBONE FOR FROM THE GUIDING THE FINES AND GETTING INFORMATION ON OUTCOMES AND SPECIFYING THE OUTCOMES THAT YOU WANT. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THESE REALLY LARGE INVESTMENTS THAT SPAN ANOTHER. REALLY KIND OF GUIDANCE DO YOU WANT TO HAVE TO AND TO PROVIDE OVER HOW FUNDS ARE PRIORITIZED AND ALSO WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION DO YOU WANT TO GET BACK SO. YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TIME TO DO THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT IT THAT IS ALSO SOMETHING YOU CAN FOLLOW UP ON THEM. THE SUMMER BOTH WITH BUDGET BILL JUNIORS AND WOMEN WITH TRAILER BILL THAT RELLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS TO THINK ABOUT. SEND A CERTAIN FINAL POINT IT JUST BILL THEM AS EHLERS POINT AND HIS KEYS POINT I THINK WE'VE GOT A REAL OPPORTUNITY WITH THIS REGIONAL CLIMATE ADAPTATION PLANNING TO. TO AUGMENT SOME OF THE- THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER WHEN IT COMES TO HARDENING. IN THAT THERE MAY BE SOME TRIP TODAY SHOULD WE GET THAT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND- IN. TOO MUCH PUBLIC SO. IN IS HEARTENING SPACE. BUT IF WE'RE BUILDING CAPACITY AT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. TO MATCH THESE CLIMATE VULNERABILITIES. AND TO ACTUALLY WORK NOT JUST ON THE PLANNING SIDE BUT ON THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SIDE DOING PRE HAZARD MITIGATION. AND DEFINE THE AREAS THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE. TO WILDFIRE OR TO FLOOD WHAT TO C. LEVEL RISE AND ACTUALLY MICROTARGETING THAT. INVESTMENT WE'RE GONNA MAKE DOLLARS. PERFORM MUCH BETTER PRIVATE AND PUBLIC GOING FOR IN THE FUTURE SO I REALLY HOPE WE CAN LAND SOMETHING HERE. USE THE EXISTING ARCHITECTURE THAT OPR STARTED TO BUILD AND THEN MARRY THAT TO SOME OF THE EXISTING EFFORTS GOING ON. AT CAL FIRE AND C. N. R. A. WITH THAT I WILL SHUT OFF MY MIKE. CLOSE MY MOUTH AND WITH THAT. THE BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW SUBCOMMITTEE ON- THAT. ENERGY ENVIRONMENT NATURAL RESOURCES. IS IN RECESS UNTIL ONE THIRTY. P. FIVE. BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW- SUBCOMMITTEE AT TWO- WE ARE IN DISCUSSION ON ITEMS. NINETY NINETY ONE NINETY TWO NINETY THREE WHICH IS WHICH INCLUDES THE GOVERNOR'S RESILIENCY PACKAGE HE HAS- LISTEN THE- HYDROGEN BIOFUELS PILOT PROGRAM. I BELIEVE- THE SENATOR. MACQUARIE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR IN AMATEUR R. I. I KNOW WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT S. P. FORTY FIVE ALL THAT DID THE FUNNY THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ESPECIALLY IN THIS CHALLENGING YEAR YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO BE THE FIRST TALK ABOUT ALL ISSUES OF HYDROGEN- LOOK AND I KNOW THAT IT IS WITHOUT PREJUDICE THAT. THE SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS RECOMMENDED DEFERRING ACTION ON SEVERAL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. INCLUDING THOSE AFFECTING HYDROGEN REFUELLING INVESTMENTS AND OTHER CARBON REDUCTION MEASURES MEASURES AS WELL AS SEVERAL CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROPOSALS. AND I AGREED WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN THE CHAIR AND THE SENATE'S APPROACH. CANDIDLY WE NEED MORE INFORMATION ON THESE PROPOSALS WE DON'T HAVE. ALL THE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE BUDGET OR THE TREE THE PROPOSALS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THIS TIME- AND ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ASSEMBLY IS ASKING FOR VERY. SIMILAR DATA POINTS SO I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE CHAIRS APPROACH AND I THINK IT'S A SMART ONE. AND I EXPECT SOME OR POTENTIALLY ALL OF THE MINISTRATION PROPOSALS WILL ULTIMATELY BE APPROVED IN THE BUDGET. THAT SAID I WANNA CALL PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE HYDROGEN REFUELING ITEMS. AND THAT THE LETTER RECEIVED FROM- THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES AND I KNOW THAT SENATOR ARCHULETA IS VERY INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE AS WELL. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS COMPLEMENTED BY NEW MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN AMERICAN JOBS PLAN. AND LOOK IT'S GOING TO CREATE THOUSANDS OF HIGH WAGE FAMILY SUSTAINING JOBS WITH. JOBS THAT ARE CONNECTED TO BENEFITS- AND ESPECIALLY WILL BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY'RE ALSO CLEAN ENERGY AND LOW CARBON POLLUTING INVESTMENTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS CLIMATE TARGETS. EVERYONE ASKS DEFINE WHAT A GREEN JOB IS. THIS BUDGET WOULD INVEST IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GREEN JOBS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIS IS WHAT JOB CREATION IN THE NEW GREEN ECONOMY IS ALL ABOUT AND AGAIN AT MISTER CHAIR FULLY SUPPORT. YOUR RECOMMENDATION HI AND WOULD HOPE THAT ANY FINAL BUDGET AGREEMENT COULD INCLUDE INVESTMENT IN THAT HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE AS I KNOW IT'S SO CRITICAL ESPECIALLY TO THOSE URBAN- UNDERSERVED. COMMUNITIES AND THANK YOU SO MUCH ATTENTION. CUTE EITHER OF MEMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT. ON ANY OF THE- ITEMS IN PART A OR PART B. THAT OUR VOTE ONLY WE CAN'T ASK QUESTIONS OF THE- OF THE AGENCIES WE CAN MAKE STATEMENTS SO- CENTER STERNER RECOGNIZE. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SO MY THE ITEMS I WANTED TO RAISE HERE LET ME JUST PULL. THIS OKAY SO- ON. THE ISSUE OF A LET'S START LET'S START PARTE- UNDER THE CC- ON THE C. C.'S ENERGY PROGRAM INVESTMENT AS WELL AS THE- CALIFORNIA RESOURCE BOARD ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PROPOSALS- HOPING WE CAN. WHERE IN SOME KIND OF COMPROMISE THERE THAT RECOGNIZES THE QUITE VISIONARY AND SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THE NINE HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- ACCELERATING PROGRESS I KNOW WE'RE DEFERRING THAT ITEM AND- IT'S AN ACQUIRED JUST TALKED ABOUT THE GREEN HYDRANT PROJECT PRODUCTION PIECE OF IT BUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER PIECES ON PRE COMMERCIAL LONG DURATION STORAGE- ON CRITICAL RESOURCE IN TRANSMISSION PLANNING WE JUST SAW SOME REALLY BIG NEWS TODAY. ON OFFSHORE WIND- SO VERY EXCITED ABOUT ALL THAT SO I'M HOPING WE KEEP GATHERING STEAM THE BUILDING ON PROGRESS THERE AS WELL AS IN THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM- I THINK WHICH IS UNDER BOTH ITEMS FIVE AND THIRTEEN- I HOPE WE CAN KEEP MAKING PROGRESS WE KNOW IN OUR D. C.'S NUMBER SAY FIVE TO SIX BILLION IS REQUIRED ANNUALLY TO METERS HAVE GOALS. SO WE HVE TO KEEP AIMING HIGH THERE AS WELL- SO HOPEFULLY WE KEEP MAKING SOME PROGRESS- ON ITEM ELEVEN- UNDER PART B. WHEN IT COMES TO CAL JAM- OVERSIGHT- WE'VE BEEN STAFF HAS BEEN ON THE NURSERY SERVICES AND WATER COMMITTEE'S BEEN REVIEWING THE P. C. P. THERE- AS WELL AS THE- TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL IN THE MAY REVISE FOR OIL WELL REMEDIATION- WE'VE GOT TO MAKE PROGRESS THIS YEAR. WHEN IT COMES TO- BOTH ABANDON AN ORPHAN WELLS AS WELL AS IDA WELLS THAT REALLY ARE RIGHT BE- IT CATEGORIZES DESERTED AND TAKEN OUT OF PRODUCTION- I THINK THE INDUSTRY UNDERSTANDS THIS POINT AND THERE'S BEEN SOME FRUSTRATION EVEN THERE FROM THE INDUSTRY SIDE AND FROM THE FOLKS IN LABOR WHO WORK IN OIL AND GAS THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH. THROUGHPUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE PLUGGING PROCESS I THINK THERE'S SOME REALLY EXCITING OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THIS WORK I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD ALL BE ON THE PUBLIC DIME THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL I THINK IS EXCITING BUT WE'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE GOING FORWARD HOW WE CAN FIND A PARTNERSHIP HERE. SOME INDUSTRY MATCH OR SOME OPPORTUNITY HERE TO- TO MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR PARTNERS IN LABOR TO DO MORE URBAN ORIENTED. WELL CLOSURE WORK AND IF WE COULD TAKE SAY YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THE TARGET IS I THINK THIRTY EIGHT WELLS TO BE CLOSER TO THE ORPHAN WELL PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT EIGHT TO TEN YEARS OUT OF THE B. C. P. THAT'S NOT GONNA INSPIRE A LOT OF TRUCKS FROM OUR FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES THE FOLKS OUT THERE WHO ARE HURTING. WHO ARE WANTING TO SEE MORE SETBACKS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT NEIGHBORHOOD DRILLING WE'VE GOT TO START DEMONTRATING PROGRESS THIS YEAR AND IN THE YEARS AHEAD I TRULY THINK WE CAN HAVE A PARTNERSHIP HERE WHERE IT'S NOT ONLY GOING TO CURRENT AND TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO NECESSARILY OR VICE VERSA BUT EMPOWERING LOCAL ACTION ON THIS FRONT WE'VE SEEN ELLIE CITY COUNCIL START TO ACT GET THEIR% OWN INSPECTORS IN PLACE SO. VERY A VERY PASS ABOUT ISSUE AND I HOPE THROUGH THIS BUDGET WE CAN LAND SOME BIGGER COMPROMISED. TO START JUST. NOT FIGHTING ON THE BUMPER STICKER POLITICS BUT ACTUALLY CLOSING THE MOST DANGEROUS WELLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I KNOW WE TOUCHED IN ITEM FOURTEEN A LITTLE EARLIER- AND CENTER REQUIRE AND I ARE BOTH CHAMPIONING THIS. CONTRACT CITIES REQUESTS. FOR FOURTEEN POINT THREE MILLION ON THE SIX FUELS CREWS- WE'RE GOING TO KEEP PUSHING HARD AND WANT TO SEE- OUR LOCAL FIRE DISTRICTS. GET THEIR FAIR SHARE AND DO THAT DO THE WORK- I WOULD ALSO I WOULD ALSO NOTE. THERE'S AN ITEM. THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY MENTION HERE BT- WHEN IT MAY BE UNDER THIS COMMITTEE'S JURISDICTION WE'VE WE FUNDED WE'VE HAD FUNDING IN THE PAST THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE- FOR OUR- THROUGH WORK FOR MUSEUMS ED FOR A CULTURAL HISTORICAL RESOURCES- I THINK THERE'S SOME SOME INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK TO BE DONE THERE. AND YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST RAISE THAT THIS IS BEING DISCUSSED IN STEP FOUR AND IT WAS ALSO TO DISCUSS IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE BUT THESE CULTURAL HISTORIC AND INSTITUTIONS WERE SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC- AND THERE'S BEEN TWO OR FIFTY MILLION PROPOSE FOR C. C. H. E. AT THE RESOURCES AGENCY SO I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT HERE HISTORIC UNDER INVESTMENT BUT THE NEED IS GREAT AND WE HAVE TO HELP THESE ARTS CULTURE AND CREATIVE INDUSTRIES SURVIVE AFTER HAVING A VERY VERY TOUGH YEAR. LASTLY WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I WOULD JUST RAISE- GOING FORWARD I STILL BELIEVE IN THE CLIMATE CATALYST- I THINK THAT WHETHER IT'S CIRCULAR ECONOMY SMART AGRICULTURE- LEVERAGED FUNDING IS GOING TO BE VALUABLE GOING FORWARD SO I'M HOPING WE CAN GIVE DUE CONSIDERATION- TO SEEING THE CLIMATE CATALYST- REALLY BECOME AN ENGINE FOR FINANCING PROJECTS THAT ARE JUST TOO BIG AND TOO MY TEACHERS FOR GRANTS ALONE- AND WITH THAT.
