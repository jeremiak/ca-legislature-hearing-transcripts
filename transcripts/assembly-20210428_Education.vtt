SOMEONE FROM THE PUBLIC.

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:58.242
SOMEONE FROM AN INDUSTRY FROM

00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:59.143
I'M FROM THE SCHOOL OR

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:00.378
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THIS BILL

00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:01.679
ACTUALLY. CAME ALREADY

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:02.413
ORIGINALLY FROM MY OWN

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.247
EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM

00:38:03.314 --> 00:38:04.682
WHERE AND I. AS A HIGH SCHOOL

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:06.283
TEACHER HAD A STUDENT. THAT I

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.119
NOTICED WAS HAVING ISSUES AND I

00:38:08.185 --> 00:38:09.353
WENT TO THE SCHOOL COUNSELOR.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.955
AND I BASICALLY HANDED THE

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:13.524
ISSUE OFF TO HER. AND I JUST

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:15.593
DIDN'T FEEL THAT EVEN ACCOUNTS

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.862
OR KNEW WHERE TO GO. EXACTLY

00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:18.996
NOW THAT MAY HAVE CHANGED OVER

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:20.064
THE LAST FEW YEARS I HOPE I

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:21.499
HAS BEEN. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:23.401
HAS BUT I THINK WHAT THIS BILL

00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:24.969
SEEKS TO DO IS REALLY BILLS

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:26.270
PROTOCOL SOME POLICY AT THE

00:38:26.337 --> 00:38:27.705
SCHOOL SITE LEVEL. THIS IS SO

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:28.939
IMPORTANT AT THE SCHOOL SITE

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:31.175
LEVEL SO THAT WHEN A TEACHER NO

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:33.010
STUDENTS HAVING STRUGGLES-

00:38:33.077 --> 00:38:35.112
ESPECIALLY BE THEY MENTAL- THAT

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:38.382
THERE IS A PLACE FOR THAT

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:39.283
TEACHER TO GO. AND THE ISSUE OF

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.184
BECAUSE THE TEACHER SHOULD BE

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:41.686
DIAGNOSED SHOULDN'T BE TREATING

00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:43.521
TO THE TEACHER MAYBE. QUITE OFF

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:44.522
BASE IT MAY JUST BE A BAD DAY

00:38:44.588 --> 00:38:46.557
FOR THAT STUDENT- BUT THERE

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:47.892
NEEDS TO BE SOME PROTOCOLS AND

00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:49.960
POLICIES SOME NEXT STEPS. SO

00:38:50.027 --> 00:38:51.962
THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY AND SOME

LOCAL LEVEL THIS AND IT TO DO

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:04.341
IT SCHOOL SITE LEVEL-

00:39:04.408 --> 00:39:05.743
PERFECTLY. BUT THIS IS ONE THAT

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:06.911
WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:09.146
HOW DO WE HELP STUDENTS WHO ARE

00:39:09.213 --> 00:39:10.614

PARENTS WITH TEACHERS AND

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.956
COMPLETE- STAFF APPROACH BUT

01:24:22.023 --> 01:24:24.726
LOOKING AT EXPELLING YOUNG

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:28.196
CHILDREN- I THINK THAT WHEN WE

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:30.498
BRING THE BEST MINDS TOGETHER.

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:32.901

THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE AT OUR

FINGERTIPS THOSE ARE GOING TO

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:37.739
PRODUCE THE BEST RESULTS AND

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:40.875
SO- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:43.545

THINK THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BILL

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:58.193
AND I THINK AS WE CONTINUE TO

01:24:58.259 --> 01:25:00.628
WORK WITH CHILDREN. WE HAVE TO

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:01.596
LOOK AT ALL THE WAYS THAT WE

01:25:01.663 --> 01:25:04.432

01:25:04.499 --> 01:25:06.534
YOUNGEST AGES. BECAUSE WE KNOW

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:08.636
THAT THOSE EARLY INTERVENTIONS

01:25:08.703 --> 01:25:11.473
ON THOSE EARLY EXPERIENCES LAY

01:25:11.539 --> 01:25:14.909

CONSULTATION TO THE CHILD RIGHT

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:39.887
WE'RE PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THE

01:27:39.954 --> 01:27:41.556
TEACHER AND FOR THE PARENTS.

01:27:41.623 --> 01:27:45.593
BECAUSE AS. A CLASSROOM TEACHER

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:46.094
WE ARE EXPECTED TO BE.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:46.995
EVERYTHING TO A EVERYBODY. I

01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:49.063
WITH A GRANDMA MOM DAD I WAS

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:50.031
YOU KNOW PSYCHOLOGIST

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:53.134
PSYCHIATRIST- NUTRITIONIST. AND

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:54.969
WE'RE QUITE FRANKLY OUR

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:57.405
EDUCATION TO BECOME TEACHERS

01:27:57.472 --> 01:27:58.973
DOESN'T PROVIDE THE SUPPORT.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.508
THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DEAL

01:28:00.575 --> 01:28:01.442
WITH THESE ISSUES ARE BACK

01:28:01.509 --> 01:28:03.077
THAT'S WHY THIS BILL INCLUDES

01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:03.611
THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:05.680
CONSULTATIONS. TO ASSIST THE

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:07.281
TEACHER AS WELL NOT JUST THE

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:09.584
STUDENT OR THE FAMILY. AND OF

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:10.785
COURSE IF THERE'S REALLY

01:28:10.852 --> 01:28:13.554
EGREGIOUS- BEHAVIOR THEN THAT

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:15.156
TEAM CAN COME TOGETHER AND

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:16.524
FIGURE OUT IF WHAT WE'R DOING

01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:17.992
IS NOT WORKING BUT I THINK FOR

01:28:18.059 --> 01:28:19.227
ME IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:21.529
WE PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT. TO THE

01:28:21.596 --> 01:28:23.564
STUDENT FIRST INFORMAL STRAIGHT

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:24.899
THE FAMILY BUT THE TEACHERS SO

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:26.668
THAT. TEACHERS ARE EQUIPPED

01:28:26.734 --> 01:28:28.903
WITH THE TOOLS ARE THE SUPPORT

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.171
THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:31.806
INTERVENE IN THESE CASES AND-

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:33.207
YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY B. THESE

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:35.143
KIDS ARE THREE AND FOUR. AND SO

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:37.111
AGAIN IF WE SUSPEND THEM. IF

01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:38.212
I'M THREE OR FOUR I WANT TO GO

01:28:38.279 --> 01:28:39.647
HOME AND PLAY. RIGHT AND SO

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:41.916
WE'RE ONLY- ENCOURAGING BAD

01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:43.785
BEHAVIOR BY BY SUSPENDING THEM

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:44.686
SO I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:47.455
IMPORTANT AND AGAIN. PROVIDING

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:48.690
IS WHAT I THINK FOR ME IS THE

01:28:48.756 --> 01:28:50.758
MOSTIMPORTANT. AS ALL THREE

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:52.627
COMPONENTS ARE THEPARENT THE

01:28:52.694 --> 01:28:55.463
TEACHER AND THE FAMILY IS

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:56.030
GETTING THAT SUPPORT. YEAH I

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:58.099
THINK THAT THAT IS GREAT AND- I

01:28:58.166 --> 01:28:58.666
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THIS

01:28:58.733 --> 01:29:00.201
BILL TO SUPPORT AND THE SHARING

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:01.235
OF BEST PRACTICES AND I AGREE

01:29:01.302 --> 01:29:03.071
WITH YOU THE SUSPENSION CAN BE

01:29:03.137 --> 01:29:04.072
SORT OF OVER USED. AS AN

01:29:04.138 --> 01:29:06.207
INTERVENTION- AND THAT WE

01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:07.408
SHOULD DEFINITELY BE SHARING

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:08.576
BEST PRACTICES OR WE CAN JUST

01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:10.044
MIGHT MY OBJECTION IS WITH THE

01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:11.579
HARD AND FAST RULE THAT. YOU

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:12.680
KNOW PRECLUDES AN

01:29:12.747 --> 01:29:15.083
INDIVIDUALIZED EVALUATION- YOU

01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:16.884
KNOW INTO THAT IS THAT THAT IS

01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:18.653
SENSITIVE TO. THE UNIQUE

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.288
CIRCUMSTANCES OF PARTICULAR

01:29:20.354 --> 01:29:21.522
CHILD IN A PARTICULAR SCHOOL.

01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:23.424
OKAY I ACTUALLY THINK IT DOES

01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:24.559
THOUGH IT DOES YEAH I THINK IT

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:26.160
DOES I THINK YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT

01:29:26.227 --> 01:29:28.296
I THINK YOUR CONCERN IS IT.

01:29:28.362 --> 01:29:28.830
THEN THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:31.532
NEVER RIGHT- BECAUSE AS A

01:29:31.599 --> 01:29:32.333
CLASSROOM TEACHER MY MIDDLE

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.435
SCHOOL A LOT OF YEARS RIGHT-

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:35.937
YOU HAVE TO HAVE TOOLS BEFORE

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:37.872
YOU THAT YOU CAN HELP. RIGHT

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:39.373
SECRETARY HEATHER THIRTY FIVE

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:39.874
OTHER CHILDREN IN THAT

01:29:39.941 --> 01:29:42.744
CLASSROOM- THAT YOU NEED TO

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:44.612
MAKE SURE ARE SAFE AS WELL. SO

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:46.047
I DON'T GET SAYS NEVER JUST

01:29:46.114 --> 01:29:47.648
SAID SAID SOME PROTOCOLS RIGHT

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:48.916
AND I WILL THROUGH PROGRESS AND

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:50.051
HOW I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFIC

01:29:50.118 --> 01:29:51.352
LANGUAGE ON THIS I DON'T WANT.

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:52.487
DON'T I DON'T RECALL WHAT IT

01:29:52.553 --> 01:29:54.088
SAID BUT THE TEACHERS DO HAVE

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:55.223
TO HAVE THE IMMEDIATE ABILITY

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:56.591
REMOVE A CHILD FROM A CLASSROOM

01:29:56.657 --> 01:29:57.692
OFTEN FOR JUST THAT CHILD

01:29:57.759 --> 01:29:58.993
SOMETHING. YET OR MAYBE THE

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.194
SAFETY OF OTHERS SO THAT THAT

01:30:00.261 --> 01:30:01.863
NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED. YEAH I

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:02.930
THINK WE'RE SEEING HERE WHAT

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:07.902
WE'RE ASKING HERE IN CALLING.

01:30:07.969 --> 01:30:08.503
FOR HER SOME PROTOCOLS BEFORE

01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:09.570
WE DO- SUSPEND. AND RIGHT

01:30:09.637 --> 01:30:10.571
INSTEAD OF GOING DIRECTLY TO

01:30:10.638 --> 01:30:12.273
THIS RANCH AND ACCORDING TO THE

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:13.274
SAP CENTER AT THE HOSPITAL BUT-

01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:14.275
SHALL. NOT THAT THAT WOULD

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:16.611
NEVER HAPPEN. GIVEN SOME

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:18.846
EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES SO I

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:21.182
THINK. I THINK WERE. MOSTLY ON

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:22.250
THE SAME PAGE RIGHT AND ACTING

01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:23.151
AND THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE

01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:24.118
WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE

01:30:24.185 --> 01:30:25.286
BECAUSE I THINK WE MADE SOME

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:27.021
AMENDMENTS TO BE ABLE TO

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:28.389
IDENTIFY YOU KNOW WHERE THAT

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:30.792
LOOPHOLES MAY BE. AN OBVIOUSLY

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:31.893
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:33.194
FOR EVERYONE BUT I THINK THIS

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.329
IS THE BEST APPROACH- YOU KNOW

01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:36.931
IT'S PROGRESS HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:30:36.998 --> 01:30:37.932
THAT THE KIDS ARE GETTING THAT

01:30:37.999 --> 01:30:40.501
THAT- SUPPORT AND THEN IF THAT

01:30:40.568 --> 01:30:41.936
DOESN'T WORK THEN THAT'S WHEN

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:42.770
YOU KNOW THE TEAM COMES

01:30:42.837 --> 01:30:44.071
TOGETHER AND SAYS. WHAT ELSE

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:45.573
CAN WE DO THIS HASN'T WORKED

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.674
BUT I DON'T IT'S ONLY STUDENT

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:47.809
SAFETY RIGHT THAT COULD BE THE

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:49.944
ULTIMATE REASON FOR- EVEN THE

01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:50.545
OF REMOVAL PART OF THE SCHOOL

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:52.380
DAY THERE'S NO OTHER. REASON

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:54.248
THAT CAN BE USED WELL I THINK

01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:55.716
XIN RIGHT BUT THAT YOU KNOW AND

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:56.751
THE REASON FOR THIS BILL IS

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.252
WHEN WE DID THIS THE RESEARCH

01:30:58.319 --> 01:31:00.021
ON THE STATISTICS- BUT BUT

01:31:00.087 --> 01:31:00.721
THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS WERE

01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:02.123
BEING SUSPENDED FOR BITING.

01:31:02.190 --> 01:31:04.492
WHICH WHICH YOU KNOW IN ITS

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:06.527
FACE RIGHT IS A BITING HOWEVER

01:31:06.594 --> 01:31:07.962
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA DEVELOP

01:31:08.029 --> 01:31:09.730
DEVELOPMENTAL CHART THREE AND

01:31:09.797 --> 01:31:10.798
FOUR YEAR OLDS DON'T HAVE THE

01:31:10.865 --> 01:31:12.233
ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.501
EFFECTIVELY SO THERE WILL MEANS

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:15.069
OF COMMUNICATIONS BY BITING.

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:16.671
THE WORK WORK WITH THEY WERE

01:31:16.737 --> 01:31:17.939
SPENDING THE KIDS FOR DOING

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:19.307
SOMETHING THAT THEIR SUBPOENA

01:31:19.373 --> 01:31:20.741
DEVELOPMENTALLY THEY'RE

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:21.943
SUPPOSED TO DO BECAUSE THEY

01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:23.244
CAN'T COMMUNICATE SO YES TO

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:24.846
THAT. THE STUDENT SAFETY

01:31:24.912 --> 01:31:28.082
HOWEVER- THE POPULATION THAT

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:31.219
WAS BEING- IT SUSPENDED AND

01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:33.421
EXPELLED WAS. OVER MORE OF A

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:34.989
BIAS RATHER THAN THE THAN THE

01:31:35.056 --> 01:31:36.824
ACT BECAUSE ALL THREE AND FOUR

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:40.895
YEAR OLDS. GO THROUGH THAT'S

01:31:40.962 --> 01:31:41.629
THE DEVICE OF BITING. OKAY I

PARTICULARLY- THE BIASED ASPECT

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:55.076
AND THE THAT IS INHERENTLY OUT

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:57.111
THERE EVEN IF WELL INTENTIONED

01:31:57.178 --> 01:31:58.212
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THEY

01:31:58.279 --> 01:32:01.582
HAVE IT- TO PROTECT THE GOALS

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:03.317
OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I

01:32:03.384 --> 01:32:05.152
JUST WOULD LIKE TO ASK US THIS

01:32:05.219 --> 01:32:07.455
BILL MOVES FORWARD- IT TO

01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:08.623
CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FACT

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:09.991
THAT WE'RE SUCH A LEGALISTIC

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:12.226
SOCIETY NOW. THAT IF WE START

01:32:12.293 --> 01:32:15.529
GETTING LAWSUITS BECAUSE OF THE

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:18.065
TEMPORARY REMOVAL FROM ONE

01:32:18.132 --> 01:32:20.201
EDUCATIONAL SETTING YOUR IDEA

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:21.502
THAT YOU KNOW OF THESE KIDS GET

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:23.237
SENT HOME IN THEIR ONLINE THAT

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:24.438
I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT'S A

01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:26.807
REINFORCEMENT FOR MISBEHAVIOR

01:32:26.874 --> 01:32:28.809
BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:31.345
THAT SCHOOLS HAVE FLEXIBILITY

01:32:31.412 --> 01:32:33.014
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THE STUDENT

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.181

THIS CLASSROOM INO SOME OTHER

01:32:35.917 --> 01:32:39.353
SETTING. SO THAT- SO I JUST

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:40.454
DON'T WANT YOUR DEFINITION TO

01:32:40.521 --> 01:32:42.189
BE SO TIGHT THAT WE START

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:44.592
GETTING LAWSUITS OF THAT DEFEAT

01:32:44.659 --> 01:32:45.760
THE PURPOSE OF WHAT YOU'RE

ON THIS DEFINITION SO MY ONLY

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:51.699
REQUEST IS THAT AS THIS MOVES

01:32:51.766 --> 01:32:53.534
FORWARD YOU COULD YOU TAKE INTO

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:55.403
CONSIDERATION THE FLEXIBILITY

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:59.540
OF THAT DEFINITION OF WHAT IS.

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:02.443

EVEN PART OF THE DAY WHAT PART

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:10.251
ABOUT TEMPORARY MOVE FROM ONE

01:33:10.318 --> 01:33:11.752
CLASSROOM TO ANOTHER OR TO THE

01:33:11.819 --> 01:33:13.621

01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:20.494
THAT'S THE INTENT YOU KNOW OUR

01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:22.063

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:31.672
ISSUES THAT SOME CHILDREN THAT

I WASN'T- CAPABLE OF HELPING

01:33:34.508 --> 01:33:35.776

02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:18.036
SEEN. I AM A FIRM BELIEVER THAT

02:11:18.103 --> 02:11:19.838
AN IN PERSON EDUCATION SETTING

02:11:19.905 --> 02:11:22.441
SERVE STUDENTS BEST. BUT FULLY

02:11:22.507 --> 02:11:24.042
RECOGNIZE THAT SOME STUDENTS DO

02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:26.211
THRIVE IN AN ONLINE SETTING AND

02:11:26.278 --> 02:11:27.279
WE WILL OFFER YOU THIS

02:11:27.346 --> 02:11:29.381
ALTERNATIVE APPROACH IN

02:11:29.448 --> 02:11:31.316
CALIFORNIA. AGAIN IF YOU WANT

02:11:31.383 --> 02:11:32.451
TO SHUT DOWN ONLINE CHARTER

02:11:32.517 --> 02:11:33.518
SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE OF

02:11:33.585 --> 02:11:35.487
CALIFORNIA THIS BILL IS NOT FOR

02:11:35.554 --> 02:11:38.090
YOU IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE THEM

02:11:38.156 --> 02:11:40.392
THIS BILL IS FOR YOU. I BELIEVE

02:11:40.459 --> 02:11:41.627
ONLINE LEARNING IS NOT GOING

02:11:41.693 --> 02:11:43.128
AWAY AND I AM NOT TRYING TO

02:11:43.195 --> 02:11:44.763
ELIMINATED BUT WE MUST FORTIFY

02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:46.531
IT WITH EXPECTATIONS OF QUALITY

02:11:46.598 --> 02:11:48.300
AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND GET RID

02:11:48.367 --> 02:11:50.068
OF THE FRAUD THAT HAS BEEN LONG

02:11:50.135 --> 02:11:52.704
ASSOCIATED. WITH THIS TYPE OF

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:55.607
LEARNING. THE FACT IS THAT THE

02:11:55.674 --> 02:11:56.174
NINETEEN NINETY TWO CHARTER

02:11:56.241 --> 02:11:57.542
SCHOOL LEVEL NEVER COME BLOOD

02:11:57.609 --> 02:11:59.144
THE NINETEEN NINETY TWO CHARTER

02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:00.579
SCHOOL LAW NEVER CONTEMPLATED

02:12:00.646 --> 02:12:02.447
ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOLS. SO

02:12:02.514 --> 02:12:04.583
THERE'S RELATIVELY MINIMAL

02:12:04.650 --> 02:12:06.118
STATUTORY GUIDANCE AND

02:12:06.184 --> 02:12:07.286
OVERSIGHT OF THIS TYPE OF

02:12:07.352 --> 02:12:08.654
SCHOOLING JUST AS IN A LOT OF

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:11.423
LAW OUT THERE. PEOPLE OF TAKE

02:12:11.490 --> 02:12:11.923
ADVANTAGE OF THAT TAKEN

02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:14.159
ADVANTAGE OF THE- IT IS TIME TO

02:12:14.226 --> 02:12:15.894
END THE WILD WEST PROVIDE TRUE

OVERSIGHT STOP THE FRAUD AND

02:12:18.130 --> 02:12:19.765
ALL OF THE NEGATIVE HYPE AND

02:12:19.831 --> 02:12:21.833
SCANDALS ASSOCIATED WITH HIS

02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:24.069
THIS APPROACH TO LEARNING. SO

02:12:24.136 --> 02:12:27.005
ISSUE NUMBER ONE FRAUD OR THEFT

02:12:27.072 --> 02:12:28.874
OF PUBLIC MONEY BY MANIPULATING

02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:30.942

DATA THIS IS HAPPENING HOW DO

02:12:33.111 --> 02:12:34.479
WE ADDRESS IT WE FORTIFY THE

02:12:34.546 --> 02:12:36.014
STATUTES THAT SPEAK TO SCHOOL

02:12:36.081 --> 02:12:38.250

02:12:38.317 --> 02:12:39.785
EXAMPLES OF FRAUD WITHIN SIGHT

02:12:39.851 --> 02:12:40.986
THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF

02:12:41.053 --> 02:12:42.788
FRAUD ACROSS OUR STATE. TODAY

02:12:42.854 --> 02:12:44.256
WE WILL SHARE ONE CASE IN

02:12:44.323 --> 02:12:46.358
PARTICULAR FROM SAN DIEGO. THIS

02:12:46.425 --> 02:12:48.093
EXAMPLE WILL BE SHARED BY THE

02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:49.027
SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S

02:12:49.094 --> 02:12:50.829
OFFICE. THIS FRAUD WAS

02:12:50.896 --> 02:12:53.231
PROMULGATED BY THE NOW DEFUNCT

02:12:53.298 --> 02:12:53.799
EIGHT THREE CHARTER SCHOOL

02:12:53.865 --> 02:12:55.400
NETWORK WHICH DEFRAUDED

02:12:55.467 --> 02:12:57.703
TAXPAYERS VENTURE OLDER BY

02:12:57.769 --> 02:12:59.004
STEALING THE IDENTITIES OF

02:12:59.071 --> 02:13:00.706
LITTLE LEAGUE PLAYERS IN ORDER

02:13:00.772 --> 02:13:02.040
TO BUILD THE STATE. FOR

02:13:02.107 --> 02:13:05.444
EDUCATION THEY NEVER PROVIDED.

02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:07.079
THIS CHARTER NETWORK USED EACH

CHILD'S INFORMATION TOOL ROLL

02:13:09.147 --> 02:13:09.681
THEM IN THEIR CHARTER SCHOOLS

02:13:09.748 --> 02:13:11.717
OVER THE SUMMER. THE CHARTER

02:13:11.783 --> 02:13:13.151
SCHOOL NEVER PROVIDED ANY

02:13:13.218 --> 02:13:15.220
INSTRUCTION TO THESE CHILDREN.

02:13:15.287 --> 02:13:17.456
IN FACT THE PARENTS HAD NO IDEA

02:13:17.522 --> 02:13:19.358
THEIR CHILDREN WERE EVER

02:13:19.424 --> 02:13:21.827
ENROLLED. IN A CHARTER SCHOOL.

02:13:21.893 --> 02:13:23.161
YET THEY COLLECTED ATTENDANCE

02:13:23.228 --> 02:13:24.262
FUNDING FROM THE STATE FOR

02:13:24.329 --> 02:13:25.731
THOSE CHILDREN AS THOUGH THEY

02:13:25.797 --> 02:13:29.735
DID ATTEND THAT SCHOOL. THE A.

02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:30.635
THREE CHARTER SCHOOL NETWORK

02:13:30.702 --> 02:13:32.471
USED ANOTHER SCHEME TO COLLECT

02:13:32.537 --> 02:13:34.740
EVEN MORE FUNDING. THEY MOVE

02:13:34.806 --> 02:13:36.541
STUDENTS BETWEEN THEIR SCHOOLS

02:13:36.608 --> 02:13:37.876
AND MANIPULATED THEIR CALENDAR

02:13:37.943 --> 02:13:39.678
USING MULTI TRACK YEAR ROUND

02:13:39.745 --> 02:13:41.747
SCHEDULING. TO DRAW DOWN FAR

02:13:41.813 --> 02:13:44.916
MORE. THAN ONCE ONE SCHOOL YEAR

02:13:44.983 --> 02:13:45.450
OF ATTENDANCE FUNDING PER

02:13:45.517 --> 02:13:48.954
STUDENT. AT ONE POINT THE- SOME

02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:50.288
OF THE FOLKS THAT WERE

02:13:50.355 --> 02:13:52.257
DEFENDING SOMEBODY INDIVIDUALS

02:13:52.324 --> 02:13:52.824
IN A THREE I SAW THIS AND IN

02:13:52.891 --> 02:13:55.026
THE MEDIA. AS I RECALL THEY

02:13:55.093 --> 02:13:55.894
DEFENDED WHAT THEY DID WAS

02:13:55.961 --> 02:13:57.796
LEGAL BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAW

02:13:57.863 --> 02:13:59.498
THAT SAID IT WASN'T LEGAL. SO

02:13:59.564 --> 02:14:01.833
WE NEED TO CLOSE THIS GAP. WITH

02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:03.335
THIS BILL WE WILL CLOSE THE

02:14:03.402 --> 02:14:04.536
LOOPHOLES AND THIS TYPE OF

02:14:04.603 --> 02:14:06.772
FRAUD THE EIGHTY EIGHTY THREE

TYPE OF FRAUD AND OTHER TYPES

02:14:07.672 --> 02:14:09.274
OF FRAUD BY ENDING THE USE OF

FOR BOTH DISTRICTS AND CHARTER

02:14:12.177 --> 02:14:15.013
SCHOOLS UNLESS THEY TRULY HAVE.

02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:17.449
FACILITY CHALLENGES. IMPROVING

02:14:42.808 --> 02:14:43.875
AND WE WILL HAVE MICHAEL FLYING

HERE FROM THICK MAT WHO SPECIFY

02:14:46.178 --> 02:14:47.479
THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT WE

02:14:47.546 --> 02:14:49.080
NEED TO SEE WHAT STUDENTS ARE

02:14:49.147 --> 02:14:50.449

TRADITIONAL CLASSROOMS. THE

LITTLE PROGRESS IN MATH THAT

02:15:54.079 --> 02:15:55.614

02:16:22.507 --> 02:16:24.009
THEY COULD SEE THEM AS LITTLE

AS ONCE PER SEMESTER. GIVEN

02:16:27.145 --> 02:16:28.680
THAT THE TYPICAL ONLINE SCHOOL

A STATE LEVEL BACKGROUND CHECKS.

02:16:56.641 --> 02:16:59.044
THIS RAISES SERIOUS SKILL SET

STUDENTS AGAIN THAT'S FOR

02:18:05.510 --> 02:18:09.147
CHARTER AND TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS.

02:18:09.214 --> 02:18:10.248
LET ME WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE

02:18:10.315 --> 02:18:12.083
ARGUMENTS WE HAVE HEARD FROM

02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:15.387

02:18:15.453 --> 02:18:16.821
OPPONENTS WILL TELL YOU THAT WE

02:18:16.888 --> 02:18:18.556

WRITING THIS BILL THAT IS

02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:22.761
ABSOLUTELY FALSE MY STAFF HAD.

02:18:22.827 --> 02:18:29.067
SEVERAL. AND MEETINGS WERE HELD

02:18:29.134 --> 02:18:30.402
WITH A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS

02:18:30.468 --> 02:18:31.770
INCLUDING ONLINE CHARTER

02:18:31.836 --> 02:18:33.705
SCHOOLS IN FACT WE ASK THE

02:18:33.772 --> 02:18:35.407
CHARTER COMMUNITY FOR THEIR

02:18:35.473 --> 02:18:37.208
IDEAS ON HOW TO STOP THIS FRAUD

02:18:37.275 --> 02:18:38.343
THEY CAME UP WITH NEARLY

02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:39.611
NOTHING ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE

02:18:39.678 --> 02:18:41.680
THEFT OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS NOR

02:18:41.746 --> 02:18:44.582
PATH TO ENSURING ATTIC ACADEMIC

SUCCESS. FOR ONLINE. SCHOOL

02:18:46.951 --> 02:18:49.020
STUDENTS. THIS BILL IS THE

02:18:49.087 --> 02:18:51.356
RESULT OF YEARS OF OBSERVATION

02:18:51.423 --> 02:18:53.558
AND DISCUSSION AND RECOGNITION

02:18:53.625 --> 02:18:54.826
THAT THE ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOL

02:18:54.893 --> 02:18:56.895
ARENA IS RIFE WITH FRAUD. A

02:18:56.961 --> 02:18:59.597
LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND

02:18:59.664 --> 02:19:02.100
POOR ACADEMIC OUTCOMES.

02:19:02.167 --> 02:19:03.234
OPPONENTS OF THE BILL WILL

02:19:03.301 --> 02:19:04.536
ARGUE THAT THE BILL IS REALLY

02:19:04.602 --> 02:19:05.704
AN EFFORT TO STOP HER CLOTHES

02:19:05.770 --> 02:19:07.505
ONLINE SCHOOLS AND LIMIT

THE CLOSURE OF A SINGLE ONLINE

02:19:19.451 --> 02:19:22.721
CHARTER SCHOOL. IN FACT THIS

02:19:22.787 --> 02:19:24.456
BILL STRENGTHENS PARENT CHOICE

02:19:24.522 --> 02:19:26.057
BY MAKING NON CLASSROOM BASED

02:19:26.124 --> 02:19:27.158
CHARTERS MORE ACCOUNTABLE

02:19:27.225 --> 02:19:28.660
TRANSPARENT AND OF HIGHER

02:19:28.727 --> 02:19:31.496
QUALITY. THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS

02:19:31.563 --> 02:19:34.099
INEQUITABLE ALL PUBLIC SCHOOL

02:19:34.165 --> 02:19:35.567
STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO

02:19:35.633 --> 02:19:37.335
A PRUDENT TO A CREDENTIALED AND

GIVEN ACCESS TO CREDENTIALED

02:19:43.508 --> 02:19:45.477
TEACHERS IN THEIR CORE. AND NON

02:19:45.543 --> 02:19:49.414
CORE INSTRUCTION. FURTHER

02:19:49.481 --> 02:19:50.915
SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE BACKGROUND

02:19:50.982 --> 02:19:53.818
CHECKS TO ENSURE STUDENT SAFETY.

02:19:53.885 --> 02:19:55.353
OPPONENTS HAVE ARGUED THAT THIS

02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:57.455
BILL MAKES DRACONIAN CUTS. THE

02:19:57.522 --> 02:19:59.524
TRUTH IS FOR EARLY BIRD FULLY

02:19:59.591 --> 02:20:02.127
VIRTUAL SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE

02:20:02.193 --> 02:20:02.761
BROOKE AND MORTAR BUILDINGS TO

02:20:02.827 --> 02:20:05.330
PAY FOR. NOR DO THEY HAVE OR

02:20:05.396 --> 02:20:07.298
NEED THE PERSONAL THAT WOULD BE

02:20:07.365 --> 02:20:09.134
REQUIRED TO OPERATE. THOSE

02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:11.903
BUILDINGS. THE FUNDING FORMULA

02:20:11.970 --> 02:20:13.638
IN THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE LESS

02:20:13.705 --> 02:20:14.672
FUNDING TO FULLY VIRTUAL

02:20:14.739 --> 02:20:16.908
PROGRAMS AND MORE STATE FUNDING

02:20:16.975 --> 02:20:18.009
TO PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE A

02:20:18.076 --> 02:20:19.544
HYBRID MODEL SINCE THESE

02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:21.246
PROGRAMS COST MORE TO OPERATE

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:22.680
IF YOU HAVE A BUILDING. YOU

02:20:22.747 --> 02:20:24.149
HAVE AN OFFICE MANAGER YOU HAVE

02:20:24.215 --> 02:20:26.217
A JANITOR. WHOMEVER YOU HAVE

02:20:26.284 --> 02:20:28.119
WORKING ON THAT SITE COSTS MORE

02:20:28.186 --> 02:20:30.221
MONEY THAN IT WOULD FOR AN

02:20:30.288 --> 02:20:32.590
ONLINE SCHOOL THAT DOESN'T HAVE

02:20:32.657 --> 02:20:35.059
FACILITIES TO FACILITIES COST

02:20:35.126 --> 02:20:37.362
MONEY. OPPONENTS WILL TELL YOU

02:20:37.428 --> 02:20:38.196
THAT THIS BILL IS TOO

02:20:38.263 --> 02:20:39.998
BURDENSOME TO THE ABSENT TO THE

02:20:40.064 --> 02:20:41.733
UPSTANDING CHARTER SCHOOLS DUE

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:43.635
TO A SINGLE BAD ACTOR. THE

02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:45.470
FRAUD PERPETUATED BY NON

02:20:45.537 --> 02:20:46.671
CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS

02:20:46.738 --> 02:20:48.740
GOES FAR BEYOND THE A. THREE

02:20:48.807 --> 02:20:51.176
CHARTER CASE. FRAUD HAS BEEN

02:20:51.242 --> 02:20:52.944
ALLEGED EIGHT THREE VALIANT

INSPIRE KAVA EPIC TRI VALLEY

02:20:55.213 --> 02:20:57.382
MAGNOLIA INSULARITY THERE ARE

02:20:57.448 --> 02:21:00.451
MORE. OTHER STATES ARE ALSO

02:21:00.518 --> 02:21:02.453
SEEING POOR ALKYD OTHER STATES

02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:03.822
ARE ALSO SEEN POOR ACADEMIC

02:21:03.888 --> 02:21:05.657
OUTCOMES AND FRAUD RELATED TO

02:21:05.723 --> 02:21:07.692
NON CLASSROOMBASED CHARTER

02:21:07.759 --> 02:21:08.259
SCHOOLS. AND THEY ARE TAKING

02:21:08.326 --> 02:21:12.864
ACTION. WE MUST DO THE SAME.

02:21:12.931 --> 02:21:14.065
OPPONENTS WILL TELL YOU THAT

02:21:14.132 --> 02:21:15.400
THIS BILL BREAKS THE AGREEMENT

02:21:15.466 --> 02:21:17.535
ON AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE NOT AT

02:21:17.602 --> 02:21:20.905
ALL THE TRUTH IS THAT AB

02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:21.906
FIFTEEN OH FIVE CREATED A TWO

02:21:21.973 --> 02:21:23.541
YEAR MORATORIUM ON THESE TOUGH

02:21:23.608 --> 02:21:25.476
ON THESE SCHOOLS PRECISELY SO

02:21:25.543 --> 02:21:26.878
THAT WE COULD STUDY THEM AND

02:21:26.945 --> 02:21:29.614
BRING FORWARD REFORMS BEFORE

02:21:29.681 --> 02:21:31.449
THE MORATORIUM. EXPIRED THE

02:21:31.516 --> 02:21:32.784
PLAN WAS ALWAYS TO COME BACK

02:21:32.851 --> 02:21:35.253
WITH REFORMS AND THAT IS WHY WE

02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:38.089
ARE HERE TODAY. AS WE STUDIED

02:21:38.156 --> 02:21:39.424
NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER

02:21:39.490 --> 02:21:40.525
SCHOOLS AND IDENTIFY THE

02:21:40.592 --> 02:21:42.360
PROBLEMS WE CREATED SOLUTIONS

02:21:42.427 --> 02:21:44.462
TO STOP THE POTENTIAL FRAUD AND

02:21:44.529 --> 02:21:46.397
ALL PUBLIC SCHOOL SETTINGS.

02:21:46.464 --> 02:21:47.699
THAT IS WHY PARTS OF THIS BILL

02:21:47.765 --> 02:21:49.801
APPLY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS

02:21:49.868 --> 02:21:52.136
WELL AS CHARTER SCHOOLS. WHAT'S

02:21:52.203 --> 02:21:53.705
GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR

02:21:53.771 --> 02:22:00.879
THE GANDER. OPPONENTS WILL TO

02:22:00.945 --> 02:22:02.347
OPPONENTS WILL TELL YOU THAT WE

02:22:02.413 --> 02:22:03.781
ONLY NEED TO BEEF UP AUDITING

02:22:03.848 --> 02:22:05.383
TO STOP THIS FRAUD NOW WE NEED

02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:07.285
TO DO MUCH MORE. ASK ANY

02:22:07.352 --> 02:22:09.587
AUDITOR. AS MR FINE WILL BE UP

02:22:09.654 --> 02:22:10.788
HERE SHORTLY FROM THE FISCAL

02:22:10.855 --> 02:22:11.723
CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT

02:22:11.789 --> 02:22:12.957

TESTIFIES AND HE WILL TELL YOU

02:22:14.659 --> 02:22:16.127
THAT AUDIENCE AUDITING ALONE

02:22:16.194 --> 02:22:19.464
WILL NOT SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS.

02:22:19.530 --> 02:22:20.431
OPPONENTS WILL TELL YOU THAT

02:22:20.498 --> 02:22:22.033
THE BILL AND STUDENT

02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:23.468
FLEXIBILITY AS TO WHEN THEY CAN

02:22:23.534 --> 02:22:25.136
COMPLETE THE WORK. THAT'S FALSE

02:22:25.203 --> 02:22:26.704
THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY WILL

02:22:26.771 --> 02:22:29.073
CLARIFY THAT THE EXISTING CD

02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:29.874
REGULATIONS WILL BE REWORKED

02:22:29.941 --> 02:22:31.609
AND REWRITTEN STUDENTS IN

02:22:31.676 --> 02:22:32.644
CHARTER SCHOOLS WILL HAVE THE

02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:34.445
SAME FLEXIBILITY AS INDEPENDENT

02:22:34.512 --> 02:22:36.381
STUDENTS IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS I

02:22:36.447 --> 02:22:37.949
THINK THAT PROBABLY PERTAINS TO

02:22:38.016 --> 02:22:39.751
A PARENT WHO MIGHT HAVE A CHILD

02:22:39.817 --> 02:22:41.352
THAT IS IN SPORTS AND MIGHT. BE

02:22:41.419 --> 02:22:42.620
PERFORMING THAT SPORT DURING TO

02:22:42.687 --> 02:22:44.589
THEIR PRACTICING THAT SPORT AND

02:22:44.656 --> 02:22:45.924
THEY MIGHT NEED TO COMPLETE

02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.591
THEIR INSTRUCTION AND SOME

02:22:46.658 --> 02:22:47.692
NONTRADITIONAL HOURS

02:22:47.759 --> 02:22:49.360
OVERSTAYING A SERVICE WE SEEK

02:22:49.427 --> 02:22:50.995
TO ACCOMMODATE THAT WE SEEK TO

02:22:51.062 --> 02:22:52.897
ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO.

02:22:52.964 --> 02:22:53.698
OPPONENTS OF THE BILL WILL TELL

02:22:53.765 --> 02:22:54.666
YOU THAT THEIR STUDENT

02:22:54.732 --> 02:22:58.169
PERFORMANCES LOWER BECAUSE THEY

02:22:58.236 --> 02:22:58.736
SERVE AT RISK STUDENTS. NON

02:22:58.803 --> 02:23:00.338
CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS DO NOT

02:23:00.405 --> 02:23:01.839
SERVICE STUDENT BODY THAT IS

02:23:01.906 --> 02:23:03.708
REFLECTIVE OF OUR STATE. THEY

02:23:03.775 --> 02:23:05.977
SERVE SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER AT

02:23:06.044 --> 02:23:06.911
RISK STUDENTS INCLUDING LOW

02:23:06.978 --> 02:23:08.980
INCOME. AN ENGLISH LEARNER

02:23:09.047 --> 02:23:10.715
STUDENTS. AND ACCORDING TO THE

02:23:10.782 --> 02:23:12.550
RESEARCH STUDENTS AND ONLINE

02:23:12.617 --> 02:23:13.952
SCHOOLS UNDER PERFORMANCE EVERY

02:23:14.018 --> 02:23:15.987
DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP. COMPARED TO

02:23:16.054 --> 02:23:17.889
THEIR PEERS IN CLASSROOM BASED

02:23:17.956 --> 02:23:21.426
SCHOOLS. OPPONENTS WILL SAY

02:23:21.492 --> 02:23:23.761
THAT SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

02:23:23.828 --> 02:23:25.997
NOT PROBLEMATIC AUTHORIZERS.

02:23:26.064 --> 02:23:27.832
THE TRUTH IS THESE DISTRICTS

02:23:27.899 --> 02:23:29.033
ARE SO SMALL THAT THE

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:30.368
SUPERINTENDENTS ARE BOTH THE

02:23:30.435 --> 02:23:31.369
BUS DRIVERS AND THE MATH

02:23:31.436 --> 02:23:33.204
TEACHERS IN A FEW DISTRICTS THE

02:23:33.271 --> 02:23:34.505
NUMBER OF CHARTER SCHOOL

02:23:34.572 --> 02:23:35.840
STUDENTS THEY OVERSEE IS FAR

02:23:35.907 --> 02:23:37.742
GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF

02:23:37.809 --> 02:23:39.544
THEIR INDUSTRY AND ROMAN. FOR

02:23:39.610 --> 02:23:42.680
EXAMPLE. A SCHOOL DISTRICT WHAT

02:23:42.747 --> 02:23:43.548
TWENTY TWO STUDENTS. HAS

02:23:43.614 --> 02:23:45.550
AUTHORIZED. IT HAS BEEN

02:23:45.616 --> 02:23:48.519
AUTHORIZED- FOR A FORTY FIVE

02:23:48.586 --> 02:23:50.788
HUNDRED STE 440-500-4440 FIVE

02:23:50.855 --> 02:23:52.323
HUNDRED. A STUDENT CHARTER

02:23:52.390 --> 02:23:53.925
SCHOOLS IN OTHER WORDS A SCHOOL

DISCUSS TWENTY TWO STUDENTS. IS

02:23:56.361 --> 02:23:57.495
OVERSEEING A CHART OF THOSE

02:23:57.562 --> 02:23:59.530
FORTY FIVE. HUNDRED STUDENTS

02:23:59.597 --> 02:24:00.498
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE

02:24:00.565 --> 02:24:01.933
INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.434
OVERSEE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED

02:24:03.501 --> 02:24:04.635
STUDENTS IF YOU ONLY HAVE

02:24:04.702 --> 02:24:06.004
TWENTY TWO. STUDENTS IN YOUR

02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:07.739
SCHOOL DISTRICT. I DISTRICT

02:24:07.805 --> 02:24:09.040
WITH A THOUSAND ADA HAS

02:24:09.107 --> 02:24:11.409
AUTHORIZED THIRTEEN THOUSAND

FIVE HUNDRED CHARTER SCHOOL

02:24:12.043 --> 02:24:13.878
ADA. I THINK OF THE SAN DIEGO A

02:24:13.945 --> 02:24:15.046
THREE CASE OF I REMEMBER OFF

02:24:15.113 --> 02:24:16.280
THE TOP OF MY HEAD CORRECTLY.

02:24:16.347 --> 02:24:17.815
THEY HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY

02:24:17.882 --> 02:24:18.483
STUDENTS IN THEIR SCHOOL

02:24:18.549 --> 02:24:20.051
DISTRICT. YET THEY HAD

02:24:20.118 --> 02:24:23.621
AUTHORIZED A CHARTER TO HAVE

02:24:23.688 --> 02:24:24.222
TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS THEY

02:24:24.288 --> 02:24:24.822
COULDN'T OVERSEE THEM THAT'S

02:24:24.889 --> 02:24:26.290
HOW THAT'LL THREE THAT'S- PART

02:24:26.357 --> 02:24:27.425
OF THE REASON ONE OF THE

02:24:27.492 --> 02:24:29.394
REASONS ONLY.THAT THE WHOLE A

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:31.295
THREE SCENARIO HAPPEN. SO IN

02:24:31.362 --> 02:24:33.097
CLOSING. I ACCEPT THE

THERE'S TWO SIDES TO AN ISSUE

02:40:03.694 --> 02:40:05.629
AND SOMETIMES WE GET A ONE

02:40:05.696 --> 02:40:06.964
PERSPECTIVE AND YET THERE IS

02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:08.565
ANOTHER AND SOMETIMES THE TRUTH

02:40:08.632 --> 02:40:10.567

SINCE JANUARY RELATED TO THIS.

02:40:15.806 --> 02:40:18.675
SOME OF MY MAJOR QUESTION THREE

02:40:18.742 --> 02:40:21.845
WILL REVOLVE AROUND THE 30% AND

02:40:21.912 --> 02:40:22.913
SO I'M GOING TO ADDRESS THIS TO

02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:26.149

CHARTER SCHOOLS OUT OF BUSINESS

02:40:33.924 --> 02:40:37.494

02:40:37.561 --> 02:40:38.829
WOULD JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE

02:40:38.895 --> 02:40:42.366
IF SOMEBODY CAN EXPLAIN.

02:40:42.432 --> 02:40:45.702

AND I WILL BE ASKING SOME OF

02:40:57.314 --> 02:40:59.249
OUR WITNESSES TO DO BACK UP ON

02:40:59.316 --> 02:41:02.719
ON SOME OF **** AND OUR OTHER

02:41:02.786 --> 02:41:05.122
AUTHORS CHINA- SO WE HAVE AT

02:41:05.188 --> 02:41:06.390
LEAST FIVE OTHER STATES THAT

02:41:06.456 --> 02:41:08.792
ARE REDUCE FUNDING FOR VIRTUAL

02:41:08.859 --> 02:41:10.460
SCHOOLS AND THEY HAVE TO SHUT

02:41:10.527 --> 02:41:12.229
DOWN ANY OF THE SCHOOLS. IN

02:41:12.295 --> 02:41:16.366
THOSE STATES AS WELL AS WE

02:41:16.433 --> 02:41:16.967
HEARD FROM OUR LEAD AUTHOR OR

02:41:17.034 --> 02:41:17.801
YOU'RE- THEY DO NOT HAVE THE

02:41:17.868 --> 02:41:19.369
SAME CLASS OF BRICK AND MORTAR

02:41:19.436 --> 02:41:20.637
OR WITH ADDITIONAL STAFF LIKE

02:41:20.704 --> 02:41:25.208
CUSTODIANS AND SO FORTH. AND SO.

02:41:25.275 --> 02:41:26.476
NOT NOT CARE THAT THEY NEED

02:41:26.543 --> 02:41:28.578
THAT ADDITIONAL- THAT THAT

02:41:28.645 --> 02:41:31.381
EXTRA 30% THERE. SO THEY

02:41:31.448 --> 02:41:32.883
TYPICALLY A SCHOOL WOULD BE

02:41:32.949 --> 02:41:34.484
FUNDED ON EIGHTY EIGHT PER

02:41:34.551 --> 02:41:36.853
STUDENT AND THAT PER STUDENT IN

02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:38.855
A PUBLIC SCHOOL WOULD BE A 100%

02:41:38.922 --> 02:41:40.590
AS THEY ATTENDED IN CLASSROOM

02:41:40.657 --> 02:41:43.060
SCHOOL. THAT NOT ONLY PAYS FOR

02:41:43.126 --> 02:41:44.327
OF COURSE YOUR CREDENTIALED

02:41:44.394 --> 02:41:46.096
TEACHERS YOUR ADMINISTRATION

02:41:46.163 --> 02:41:48.698
YOUR CUSTODIAN SHORE UP ALL

02:41:48.765 --> 02:41:50.300
PARA PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE ON

02:41:50.367 --> 02:41:52.769
THE STAFF. IF THE STUDENT IS

02:41:52.836 --> 02:41:57.107
NOW ATTENDING A NON. IN PERSON

02:41:57.174 --> 02:41:59.376
CLASSROOM WITH OUT A PHYSICAL

02:41:59.443 --> 02:42:03.280
SPACE. THEN THE POINT OF THIS-

02:42:03.346 --> 02:42:05.482
ALTER THE ALTERATION IN THIS

02:42:05.549 --> 02:42:07.217
BILL WOULD TO SAY THEN THEY

02:42:07.284 --> 02:42:09.753
SHOULD NOT BE GETTING A 100% OF

02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:12.556
ADD A. D. A. AS THERE IS NOT A

02:42:12.622 --> 02:42:14.691
BRICK AND MORTAR. LOCATION THAT

02:42:14.758 --> 02:42:16.059
THEY NEED TO USE THAT

02:42:16.126 --> 02:42:17.994
ADDITIONAL 30% FOR IS THAT

02:42:18.061 --> 02:42:19.663
PRETTY MUCH THAT THAT SUMMER

02:42:19.729 --> 02:42:21.898
ACT. ALL RIGHT SO THEN THE NEXT

02:42:21.965 --> 02:42:23.366
QUESTION I AM VOTERS IF I COULD

02:42:23.433 --> 02:42:25.035
ADD ONE MORE THING SEVENTY

02:42:25.102 --> 02:42:27.003
SCHOOLS ARE SPENDING THIRTY

02:42:27.070 --> 02:42:27.804
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT

02:42:27.871 --> 02:42:29.506
THEY'RE GIVING TO PARENTS AT

02:42:29.573 --> 02:42:30.073
THAT THE THREATENS TO SPEND

02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:32.509
HOWEVER THEY WANT- A YEAR SEEN

02:42:32.576 --> 02:42:35.078
THINGS LIKE- FOR PAYING FOR.

02:42:35.145 --> 02:42:36.580
EQUESTRIAN CLASSES THEY'RE

02:42:36.646 --> 02:42:38.381
PLAYING FOR TRIPS TO THE LEVEL

02:42:38.448 --> 02:42:38.949
AND WE HAD A FAMILY GO TO

02:42:39.015 --> 02:42:41.251
CHICAGO I THINK IT SPEAKS TO

02:42:41.318 --> 02:42:43.053
THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE

02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:44.187
THE SAME OVERHEAD AND DID NOT

02:42:44.254 --> 02:42:45.455
HAVE THE SAME MONEY SO THEY

02:42:45.522 --> 02:42:47.257
COULD AFFORD TO DO SOMETHING-

02:42:47.324 --> 02:42:48.758
THAT WE CAN DO IN TRADITIONAL

02:42:48.825 --> 02:42:49.860
SCHOOLS ARE BRICK AND MORTAR

02:42:49.926 --> 02:42:51.595
SCHOOLS. I THINK MY FRIENDS IN

02:42:51.661 --> 02:42:52.762
MY DISTRICT WOULD GLADLY TAKE

02:42:52.829 --> 02:42:53.763
THE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:42:53.830 --> 02:42:54.764
TO PAY FOR BASIC THINGS THAT

02:42:54.831 --> 02:42:58.268
THEIR STUDENTS. NEEDS BUT

02:42:58.335 --> 02:42:58.835

FOR ME IS ACTUALLY BUILT IN THE

02:43:05.609 --> 02:43:06.643
CURRENT LAW JUST AS A CURRENT

02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:09.412

02:43:09.479 --> 02:43:11.615
70% THRESHOLD. AND IF YOU LOOK

02:43:11.681 --> 02:43:14.217
AT THE INSIDE THE ANALYSIS HERE

02:43:14.284 --> 02:43:16.586
IT LAYS OUT. THE AG BASICALLY A

02:43:16.653 --> 02:43:18.788

BRICK AND MORTAR THAT

02:44:12.075 --> 02:44:13.443

THAT I SOMETIMES YES. ALL RIGHT

02:44:15.378 --> 02:44:16.413
SO THEN THE NEXT QUESTION THAT

02:44:16.479 --> 02:44:18.281
I'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT

02:44:18.348 --> 02:44:20.350

MY GROW WORKER COULD BE. A TEAM.

02:44:45.675 --> 02:44:48.345
COULD BE I JUST THEIR CHOICE TO

02:44:48.411 --> 02:44:50.247
NOT BE IN A TRADITIONAL SCHOOL

02:44:50.313 --> 02:44:51.982

FOLLOWS WITH THAT STUDENT- IT'S

02:45:00.223 --> 02:45:02.592
NOT VERY CLEAR ON EXACTLY WHAT

02:45:02.659 --> 02:45:04.794
THAT MEANS SO A STUDENT DEBT

02:45:04.861 --> 02:45:06.229

02:45:26.916 --> 02:45:36.926
ELABORATE ON THAT. I THINK. A

02:45:36.993 --> 02:45:38.662
COUPLE THOUGHTS ON MULTI TRACK

02:45:38.728 --> 02:45:39.829
NUMBER ONE THE ISSUE THAT'S

02:45:39.896 --> 02:45:41.197
TRYING TO BE ADDRESSED AS WERE

02:45:41.264 --> 02:45:43.333
STUDENTS ARE. ARE ALLOWED TO

02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:44.668
JUMP FROM TRACK TO TRACK TO

02:45:44.734 --> 02:45:48.338
ULTIMATELY- GENERATE MORE THAN

02:45:48.405 --> 02:45:49.773
ONE EIGHTY EIGHT PER YEAR. AT

02:45:49.839 --> 02:45:54.311
THE STATE'S EXPENSE- AS- THE CO

02:45:54.377 --> 02:45:57.047
AUTHORS OF SPOKEN TO- CALENDAR

02:45:57.113 --> 02:45:59.549
SET BY THE LOCAL SCHOOL- SCHOOL

02:45:59.616 --> 02:46:01.418
DISTRICT- OR CHARTER SCHOOL IN

02:46:01.484 --> 02:46:03.286
THIS CASE- AND IN THIS

02:46:03.353 --> 02:46:04.454
PROVISION IS APPLICABLE TO

02:46:04.521 --> 02:46:10.226
BOTH- THEY CAN- THE STATE LAW.

02:46:10.293 --> 02:46:13.063
SETS A MINIMUM NUMBER DAY'S

02:46:13.129 --> 02:46:14.764
INSTRUCTION NOT A MAXIMUM. AND

02:46:14.831 --> 02:46:17.000
SO IF A STUDENT WERE TO ENROLL

02:46:17.067 --> 02:46:19.202
QUOTE UNQUOTE LATE IN THE YEAR.

02:46:19.269 --> 02:46:20.670
THE CHARTER SCHOOL CAN CONTINUE

02:46:20.737 --> 02:46:22.505
TO SERVE THEM WE SERVE KIDS

02:46:22.572 --> 02:46:25.175
DURING THE SUMMER IN OTHER-

02:46:25.241 --> 02:46:27.844
ENVIRONMENTS- WHETHER WE CALL

02:46:27.911 --> 02:46:29.879
THAT SUMMER SCHOOL OR EXTENDED

02:46:29.946 --> 02:46:32.482
YEAR WHAT HAVE YOU- BUT THERE

02:46:32.549 --> 02:46:35.051
IS A- A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DAYS

02:46:35.118 --> 02:46:36.920
IN CURRENT LAW THAT THE STATE.

02:46:36.986 --> 02:46:39.522
PAYS FOR THE S. MODEL LIMIT

02:46:39.589 --> 02:46:42.092
LIMITING FACTOR ON- THE NUMBER

02:46:42.158 --> 02:46:43.493
OF DAYS THOUGH THAT A STUDENT

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:46.563
CAN BE SERVED- SO THOSE ARE

02:46:46.629 --> 02:46:48.431
THOSE ARE SOME CONSIDERATIONS

02:46:48.498 --> 02:46:51.735
OF AN EXAMPLE OF. WE ARE AT

02:46:51.801 --> 02:46:54.571
WORST PRACTICE WHERE THERE IS

02:46:54.637 --> 02:46:58.074
THIS- SCENARIO WHERE ADA COULD

02:46:58.141 --> 02:47:00.910
BE COLLECTED. MORE THAN ONCE A

02:47:00.977 --> 02:47:02.746
YEAR FOR STUDENT HOW HOW HAS

02:47:02.812 --> 02:47:04.581
THAT BEEN OCCURRING SO IN A

02:47:04.647 --> 02:47:05.982
MULTI TRACK YEAR ROUND JUST

02:47:06.049 --> 02:47:07.784
ASSUME THERE'S FOUR TRACKS EACH

02:47:07.851 --> 02:47:08.718
OF THEM STARTED DIFFERENT

02:47:08.785 --> 02:47:10.887
POINTS. OF CURRENT LAW DOES

02:47:10.954 --> 02:47:13.823
REQUIRE THAT- THEY MUST ALL

02:47:13.890 --> 02:47:15.258
HAVE STARTED BY A CERTAIN DATE

02:47:15.325 --> 02:47:17.026
OR ALL OF REACH SO MANY DAYS BY

02:47:17.093 --> 02:47:18.795
A CERTAIN DATE IN THE YEAR SO

02:47:18.862 --> 02:47:19.662
YOU WOULDN'T TYPICALLY BE

02:47:19.729 --> 02:47:23.133
STARTING A TRACK IN JANUARY AS

02:47:23.199 --> 02:47:25.602
AN EXAMPLE- SO MULTIPLE TRACKS

02:47:25.668 --> 02:47:27.704
YOU COULD START JULY ONE. IN

02:47:27.771 --> 02:47:29.739
THE CASE OF A THREE TO GIVE YOU

02:47:29.806 --> 02:47:31.775
A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE- OF THE

02:47:31.841 --> 02:47:34.544
ENROLLED STUDENTS ON TRACK ONE

02:47:34.611 --> 02:47:36.513
ON JULY ONE WHERE THEY WERE

02:47:36.579 --> 02:47:38.515
ATTENDING. A LITTLE LEAGUE.

02:47:38.581 --> 02:47:41.551
GAMES AND PRACTICES S. EIGHTY

02:47:41.618 --> 02:47:43.820
EIGHT BASICALLY- AND THEN THE

02:47:43.887 --> 02:47:46.256
STUDENT MOVED LATER IN THE YEAR

02:47:46.322 --> 02:47:48.758
TO ANOTHER TRACK. TO MAXIMIZE

02:47:48.825 --> 02:47:50.527
OR THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR HOME

02:47:50.593 --> 02:47:55.031
SCHOOL. A DISTRICT AND THEY

02:47:55.098 --> 02:47:56.633
WERE SERVED FOR THE REGULAR

02:47:56.699 --> 02:47:58.401
SCHOOL YEAR BY THAT HOME SCHOOL

02:47:58.468 --> 02:47:59.569
DISTRICT ALTERNATELY THE STATE

02:47:59.636 --> 02:48:01.504
PAID MORE THAN ONE ABA FOR THAT

02:48:01.571 --> 02:48:05.642
STUDENT. CAN I ALSO ASK THE DA

02:48:05.708 --> 02:48:06.676
TO ELABORATE ON ON THE SIX

02:48:06.743 --> 02:48:09.112
SAMPLES. I'M SORRY CAN WE ALSO

02:48:09.179 --> 02:48:10.880
AT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO

02:48:10.947 --> 02:48:12.449
ELABORATE THANK YOU. RIGHT

02:48:12.515 --> 02:48:14.217
ENGINE FOR MISTER THEM ALMOST

02:48:14.284 --> 02:48:14.784
FINDS UP THERE CAN YOU JUST

02:48:14.851 --> 02:48:15.885
ALSO SPEAK TO HELP THE

02:48:15.952 --> 02:48:17.353
INTRODUCTION CAL PADS WE

02:48:17.420 --> 02:48:18.922
ADDRESS SOME OF THIS ISSUE SURE

02:48:18.988 --> 02:48:20.457
THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL ARE

02:48:20.523 --> 02:48:22.859
THAT AS THE STATE LOOKS TO FOR

02:48:22.926 --> 02:48:25.228
LACK OF BETTER TERM- CAL PADS

02:48:25.295 --> 02:48:26.963
TWO POINT OH. A CAB AS THE

02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:28.198
STATE'S LONGITUDINAL DATA

02:48:28.264 --> 02:48:30.166
SYSTEM HERE WHERE AFFECT MATT

02:48:30.233 --> 02:48:32.569
IS THE STATE'S CONTRACTOR

02:48:32.635 --> 02:48:34.103
AWKWARD RELATIONSHIP SINCE WERE

02:48:34.170 --> 02:48:36.573
ALO STATE. A COMPONENT OF THE

02:48:36.639 --> 02:48:38.441
STATE BUT- WE'RE THE STATE'S

02:48:38.508 --> 02:48:40.710
CONTRACTOR TO THE CD EITHER

02:48:40.777 --> 02:48:42.412
OPERATES THAT SYSTEM AND SO WE

02:48:42.479 --> 02:48:45.882
KNOW IT VERY VERY WELL- THE

02:48:45.949 --> 02:48:47.650
BILL PROVIDES IT AS THEY LOOK

02:48:47.717 --> 02:48:51.254
TO- FUTURE- CAL PATCHWORK THAT

02:48:51.321 --> 02:48:53.056
THEY WOULD ALIGN EIGHTY A WITH

02:48:53.122 --> 02:48:55.391
CAL PADS. SO THE ACTUALLY SEE

02:48:55.458 --> 02:48:57.627
AT THE STATE LEVEL AT A PER

02:48:57.694 --> 02:48:59.596
STUDENT SO CAP HAD SAYS REPORT

02:48:59.662 --> 02:49:01.531
ON AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT BASIS

02:49:01.598 --> 02:49:03.399
BUT NOT ADA FOR APPORTIONMENT

02:49:03.466 --> 02:49:05.335
PURPOSES. THAT'S DONE ON AN

02:49:05.401 --> 02:49:06.703
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT BASES OF THE

02:49:06.769 --> 02:49:09.472
SCHOOL DISTRICT CHARTER SCHOOL

02:49:09.539 --> 02:49:11.508
LEVEL BUT DOES NOT FLOAT UP TO

02:49:11.574 --> 02:49:12.542
THE STATE WHEN IT FLOATS UP TO

02:49:12.609 --> 02:49:14.511
THE STATE IS IT'S JUST A TOTAL

02:49:14.577 --> 02:49:16.746
YOU LOSE VISIBILITY. OF THE

02:49:16.813 --> 02:49:18.815
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT AND SO TO

02:49:18.882 --> 02:49:20.250
SEE ONE OF STUDENTS ENROLLED

02:49:20.316 --> 02:49:22.585
AND NOT YOU CAN SEE THAT IN CAL

02:49:22.652 --> 02:49:24.287
PADS BUT NOT KNOW THEIR

02:49:24.354 --> 02:49:26.689
ATTENDANCE ACCEPTED A VERY HIGH

02:49:26.756 --> 02:49:32.328
LEVEL INCLUDING. FOR REPORTING

02:49:32.395 --> 02:49:32.929
ON CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. SO IN

02:49:32.996 --> 02:49:33.530
ESSENCE I WHAT YOU'RE IS THAT

02:49:33.596 --> 02:49:35.532
BE IF A DISTRICT AND THAT. FOR

02:49:35.598 --> 02:49:37.467
SAY ABOUT SCORING THAT'S FOR

02:49:37.534 --> 02:49:39.669
ADA WOULD BE CAUGHT YES HE'S AT

02:49:39.736 --> 02:49:41.004
THE UP THE PROVISION OF THE

02:49:41.070 --> 02:49:42.372
BILL WOULD CATCH THAT. THE CAL

02:49:42.438 --> 02:49:43.540
PASSED FOR YOU WOULD YOU WOULD

02:49:43.606 --> 02:49:46.576
HAVE VISIBILITY AT THE STATE

02:49:46.643 --> 02:49:48.678
LEVEL OF THAT ACTIVITY YES SIR.

02:49:48.745 --> 02:49:49.846
AND I BELIEVE HE ONE OF THE SAN

02:49:49.913 --> 02:49:52.115
DIEGO DA YES TWO EIGHT. AND

02:49:52.181 --> 02:49:53.449
AGAIN I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY

02:49:53.516 --> 02:49:54.350
THAT THEY ARE HERE. TO REALLY

02:49:54.417 --> 02:49:56.519
SPEAK TO. THEIR EXPERIENCED AND

02:49:56.586 --> 02:49:58.021
WHAT THEY CAN SURE IS LIMITED.

02:49:58.087 --> 02:49:59.222
WITH A THREE AND SOME OTHER

02:49:59.289 --> 02:50:00.990
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS.

02:50:01.057 --> 02:50:02.525
THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GONNA GO.

02:50:02.592 --> 02:50:03.493
TOO FAR INTO SOME OF THE TECH

02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:05.128
TO ALLMAN CIVILE BECAUSE

02:50:05.194 --> 02:50:06.529
THAT'S- NOT WHAT THEY CAME UP

02:50:06.596 --> 02:50:08.565
FOR TODAY. CORRECT SO TO MAKE

02:50:08.631 --> 02:50:10.366
SURE THEM ANSWERING THE

02:50:10.433 --> 02:50:11.801
QUESTIONS ASKED THOUGH. THE

02:50:11.868 --> 02:50:13.770
QUESTION THE BIGGEST EXAMPLES.

02:50:13.836 --> 02:50:15.939
OF HOW OLD THE DOUBLE DIPPING

02:50:16.005 --> 02:50:18.308
WITH ADA HAS OCCURRED. OKAY AND

02:50:18.374 --> 02:50:20.677
SO NOT ADDRESSING THE POLICY OF

02:50:20.743 --> 02:50:22.278
WHETHER MULTI TRACK IS GOOD OR

02:50:22.345 --> 02:50:24.314
BAD BUT WHAT WE FOUND IN THE

02:50:24.380 --> 02:50:26.916
CASE WAS SPECIFICALLY. LIKE MR

02:50:26.983 --> 02:50:28.451
FIND EXPLAINED YOU WOULD HAVE A

02:50:28.518 --> 02:50:30.186
STUDENT FOR INSTANCE. YOU KNOW

02:50:30.253 --> 02:50:33.122
STEVE A. THAT. IS ENROLLED IN A

02:50:33.189 --> 02:50:34.524
TRADITIONAL SCHOOL FOR THE

02:50:34.591 --> 02:50:36.926
SCHOOL YEAR THEY'RE ENTITLED TO

02:50:36.993 --> 02:50:37.660
ONE EIGHTY A IN A TRADITIONAL

02:50:37.727 --> 02:50:39.195
BRICK AND MORTAR SCHOOL OR A

02:50:39.262 --> 02:50:40.997
CHARTER SCHOOL. IF THEY WANT TO

02:50:41.064 --> 02:50:42.265
GO FULL TIME FOR THE ENTIRE

02:50:42.332 --> 02:50:43.833
YEAR FOR INSTANCE TAKE SUMMER

02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:45.835
SCHOOL. YOUR ONE EIGHTY A WOULD

02:50:45.902 --> 02:50:46.569
HAVE TO BE STRETCH FOR THE

02:50:46.636 --> 02:50:49.872
ENTIRE YEAR. IF YOU SWITCHED

02:50:49.939 --> 02:50:51.975
FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO

02:50:52.041 --> 02:50:53.843
ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT. OR IF

02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:55.345
YOU SWITCH FROM ONE CHARTER

02:50:55.411 --> 02:50:56.479
SCHOOL TO ANOTHER SCHOOL

02:50:56.546 --> 02:50:58.348
DISTRICT. AND THE STATE

02:50:58.414 --> 02:51:00.216
CURRENTLY HAS NO ABILITY TO

02:51:00.283 --> 02:51:02.318
ACTUALLY FOLLOW YOUR SWITCH.

02:51:02.385 --> 02:51:05.388
YOU CAN END UP RECEIVING YOUR

02:51:05.455 --> 02:51:07.056
ONE EIGHTY A PLUS AN ADDITIONAL

02:51:07.123 --> 02:51:09.359
PERCENTAGE OF ADA FOR THE

02:51:09.425 --> 02:51:11.327
SUMMER SCHOOL OR WHATEVER PART

02:51:11.394 --> 02:51:12.929
OF THE SCHOOL THAT YOU WENT TO.

02:51:12.996 --> 02:51:15.064
SO WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR CASE.

02:51:15.131 --> 02:51:16.766
IS THAT IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE

02:51:16.833 --> 02:51:18.735
MAXIMIZE PROFITS. YOU WOULD

02:51:18.801 --> 02:51:21.237
SWITCH. FROM ONE SCHOOL OR

02:51:21.304 --> 02:51:23.172
SHE'S ME ONE TRACK TO ANOTHER

02:51:23.239 --> 02:51:24.674
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL.

02:51:24.741 --> 02:51:26.009
CHARTER SCHOOLS BY ANY STRETCH

02:51:26.075 --> 02:51:27.810
OR DOING THAT OR THAT ANY MULTI

02:51:27.877 --> 02:51:31.214
TRACK FOLKS ARE DOING IT.

02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:31.781
THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND IN THAT

02:51:31.848 --> 02:51:35.785
CASE. THAT MAKES SENSE. YOUR

02:51:35.852 --> 02:51:38.421
CASE BEING ABOUT THE THREE.

02:51:38.488 --> 02:51:45.828
CORRECT SO YEAH. CAN YOU

02:51:45.895 --> 02:51:46.929
ELABORATE ON HOW MANY OTHER

02:51:46.996 --> 02:51:49.399
INVESTIGATIONS YOU HAVE ONGOING

02:51:49.465 --> 02:51:52.669
RIGHT NOW BESIDES A THREE NO.

02:51:52.735 --> 02:51:54.370
YOU CAN'T LIBRARY ARE THERE ARE

02:51:54.437 --> 02:51:54.937
OTHER INVESTIGATION I CAN'T

02:51:55.004 --> 02:51:58.708
ELABORATE. SO I'LL JUST FINISH

02:51:58.775 --> 02:52:04.547
UP MY QUESTION AS- SO AS

02:52:04.614 --> 02:52:08.718
PARENTS CHOOSE THEIR EDUCATION

02:52:08.785 --> 02:52:09.819
FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN WHETHER

02:52:09.886 --> 02:52:11.421
IT'S PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OR

02:52:11.487 --> 02:52:16.092
CHARTER ONLINE OR IN PERSON OR-

02:52:16.159 --> 02:52:18.828
THEY THEY ARE OLDER KIDS JUST

02:52:18.895 --> 02:52:21.564
AS YOU WOULD WITH ANY TYPE OF

02:52:21.631 --> 02:52:24.434
APPLICATION BUT THE WHOLE ADA

02:52:24.500 --> 02:52:26.235
PART IS NOT REALLY IN THEIR

02:52:26.302 --> 02:52:28.137
PURVIEW THEY'RE NOT THE ONES

02:52:28.204 --> 02:52:32.175
THAT. ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:52:32.241 --> 02:52:34.877
TRACKING ATTENDANCE FOR EVEN

02:52:34.944 --> 02:52:36.679
LETTING A DISTRICT KNOW IF

02:52:36.746 --> 02:52:38.481
THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE SOMEWHERE

02:52:38.548 --> 02:52:40.349
ELSE THAT'S UP TO THE DISTRICT

02:52:40.416 --> 02:52:42.652
TO FOLLOW THAT. EIGHTY EIGHT IF

02:52:42.719 --> 02:52:44.253
YOU WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY SO

02:52:44.320 --> 02:52:45.922
I'M JUST MAKING A STATEMENT

02:52:45.988 --> 02:52:49.425
THAT IN NO WAY DO I BELIEVE

02:52:49.492 --> 02:52:52.462
THAT PARENTS ARE KNOWINGLY. AT

02:52:52.528 --> 02:52:53.963
TRYING TO DOUBLE DIP IF YOU

02:52:54.030 --> 02:52:56.432
WANT TO SAY AND ALSO MAKE THE

02:52:56.499 --> 02:52:59.102
COMMENT THAT YES THERE'S BAD

02:52:59.168 --> 02:53:02.138
APPLES AND IN- WHETHER IF WE

02:53:02.205 --> 02:53:04.107
WANT TO SAY A THREE IF WE WANT

02:53:04.173 --> 02:53:05.608
TO SAY PUBLIC EDUCATION UNDER

02:53:05.675 --> 02:53:07.443
ALL OUR INSTITUTIONS AND THAT

02:53:07.510 --> 02:53:09.946
THIS BILL- AS I'M UNDERSTANDING

02:53:10.012 --> 02:53:11.881
THAT MORE IS TO TRY TO CREATE

SPADE AND TO RECOGNIZE. THAT

03:21:27.175 --> 03:21:28.576
THIS BILL IS PART OF AN EFFORT

03:21:28.643 --> 03:21:30.445
OF THIS CAPITAL TO AND CHARTER

CHARTER SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA

CHARTER SCHOOL SUCCESSFUL

03:21:44.759 --> 03:21:46.027
DEALING ESPECIALLY WITH THE

03:21:46.093 --> 03:21:47.328
MOST MARGINALIZED AND MOST

03:21:47.395 --> 03:21:49.297
VULNERABLE STUDENTS WE WERE THE

03:21:49.363 --> 03:21:51.065
ONES LIKE I SAID WITH WE WERE

03:21:51.132 --> 03:21:52.133

TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED IT'S EITHER

03:22:13.254 --> 03:22:14.155

WHEN THEY WANT TO ADDRESS THIS

03:23:36.971 --> 03:23:38.005

03:26:00.381 --> 03:26:02.049
QUESTIONS- ABOUT CLARIFICATION

03:26:02.116 --> 03:26:04.752
SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT. FINALLY

03:26:04.819 --> 03:26:06.620
I APPRECIATE TODAY I DON'T KNOW

03:26:06.687 --> 03:26:07.388
HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW THIS BUT

03:26:07.455 --> 03:26:08.889
IT WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE

03:26:08.956 --> 03:26:10.758
SANTA BARBARA UNIFIED SCHOOL

03:26:10.825 --> 03:26:11.726
DISTRICT THAT'S THE PUBLIC

03:26:11.792 --> 03:26:14.228
SCHOOL DISTRICT- SPEAKING- IN

03:26:14.295 --> 03:26:16.130
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL- SANTA

03:26:16.197 --> 03:26:18.299
BARBARA BEING- THE- MAJOR

03:26:18.365 --> 03:26:20.334
SCHOOL DISTRICT- YEAH. IN MY

03:26:20.401 --> 03:26:24.171
DISTRICT. BUT CLEARLY- KATE

03:26:24.238 --> 03:26:27.641
FORD'S- TESTIMONY- IDENTIFIES

03:26:27.708 --> 03:26:30.277
THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SERIOUS-

03:26:30.344 --> 03:26:31.479
THAT THAT THE SERIES OF

03:26:31.545 --> 03:26:33.714
COMPROMISES OVER THE YEARS. HAS

03:26:33.781 --> 03:26:36.884
LED TO. MUCH LESS ANIMOSITY AND

03:26:36.951 --> 03:26:38.419
A STRONGER BOND BETWEEN CHARTER

03:26:38.486 --> 03:26:41.689
SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS-

03:26:41.756 --> 03:26:43.090
PUBLIC SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS

03:26:43.157 --> 03:26:44.625
HAVE. NOT TALKED TO ME ABOUT

03:26:44.692 --> 03:26:46.660
CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE- ABOUT

03:26:46.727 --> 03:26:48.729
THIS BILL. AND THAT IMPROVED

03:26:48.796 --> 03:26:50.030
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC

03:26:50.097 --> 03:26:51.232
SCHOOLS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AS

03:26:51.298 --> 03:26:56.103
BENEFICIAL FOR EVERYBODY AND.

03:26:56.170 --> 03:26:57.438
HELPFUL TO MAINTAIN AND- SO I

03:26:57.505 --> 03:26:58.939
PER HER. AND HELPING TO. MAKE

03:26:59.006 --> 03:26:59.573
IT CLEAR THAT THAT'S OUT THERE

03:26:59.640 --> 03:27:01.709
AND WHY THEY- HAVE SOME ISSUES

03:27:01.776 --> 03:27:03.611
SO AS I EVALUATE THIS BILL MY

03:27:03.677 --> 03:27:05.412
GOAL I JUST HAVE ONE GOAL AND

03:27:05.479 --> 03:27:06.247
THAT'S JUST GOOD GOVERNMENT

03:27:06.313 --> 03:27:07.281
JUST TRY TO CONVINCE ME THAT

03:27:07.348 --> 03:27:08.749
IT'S GOOD GOVERNMENT OUT OF A

03:27:08.816 --> 03:27:10.718
SUPPORT THE BILL- AND SOME

03:27:10.785 --> 03:27:12.386
PEOPLE AS- WE'VE HEARD HER TO

03:27:12.453 --> 03:27:13.320
CHECK YOUR BELIEVE THIS BILL

03:27:13.387 --> 03:27:15.055
WILL BRING AN END TO NEARLY ALL

03:27:15.122 --> 03:27:18.292
ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOLS- AND-

03:27:18.359 --> 03:27:20.060
THAT THAT IS I BELIEVE THE MOST

03:27:20.127 --> 03:27:21.228
IMPORTANT CONCERN BEING

03:27:21.295 --> 03:27:22.229
EXPRESSED BY THE PARENTS THAT

03:27:22.296 --> 03:27:23.564
ARE COMMUNICATING TO ME HEY

03:27:23.631 --> 03:27:24.365
THIS IS GOING TO BRING THIS TO

03:27:24.431 --> 03:27:26.801
AN END- THAT THE PARENT EVEN.

03:27:26.867 --> 03:27:28.736
IS SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE-

03:27:28.803 --> 03:27:30.171
THE ISSUES THAT MOST GENERATE

03:27:30.237 --> 03:27:32.406
THIS CONCERN ABOUT CLOSURE ARE

03:27:32.473 --> 03:27:34.341
THESE AS FAR AS I SEE IT. THE

03:27:34.408 --> 03:27:35.442
REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE A

03:27:35.509 --> 03:27:37.545
PHYSICAL PRESENCE FOR ONLINE

03:27:37.611 --> 03:27:39.213
LEARNING THE INCREASE OF THE

03:27:39.280 --> 03:27:41.315
FEE FROM 1% TO THREE PERCENT.

03:27:41.382 --> 03:27:42.683
THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FUNDING

03:27:42.750 --> 03:27:45.586
FORMULA MOVING IT TO A FORMULA

03:27:45.653 --> 03:27:47.454
THAT'S BASED ON HOW MUCH ONLINE

03:27:47.521 --> 03:27:48.756
I MEAN HOW MUCH IN PERSON

03:27:48.823 --> 03:27:51.625
INSTRUCTION YOU HAVE- AND- THEN

03:27:51.692 --> 03:27:53.294
THERE. AND THEN THEY ALSO THE

03:27:53.360 --> 03:27:54.428
RESTRICTION OF THE CHARTER

03:27:54.495 --> 03:27:55.863
SCHOOLS WHICH WAS AT BEING

03:27:55.930 --> 03:27:57.498
BEING RESTRICTED TO JUST ONE

03:27:57.565 --> 03:27:59.466
COUNTY- THERE ARE ALSO SOME

03:27:59.533 --> 03:28:01.001
ISSUES- REGARDING PROCESS

03:28:01.068 --> 03:28:02.236
FOLLOWED IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF

03:28:02.303 --> 03:28:03.571
THE BILL. AND I THINK THE

03:28:03.637 --> 03:28:05.739
DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD HERE-

03:28:05.806 --> 03:28:07.608
BUT LET ME IDENTIFIED THAT THE

03:28:07.675 --> 03:28:09.410
PROCESS QUESTIONS AS THE

03:28:09.476 --> 03:28:10.644
WEAKEST ARGUMENT THAT I'VE

03:28:10.711 --> 03:28:12.847
HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION- IN

03:28:12.913 --> 03:28:14.381
TERMS OF DOING THAT. I

03:28:14.448 --> 03:28:15.583
CERTAINLY COMING HERE DON'T

03:28:15.649 --> 03:28:17.051
FEEL LIKE I'M BOUND BY

03:28:17.117 --> 03:28:18.819
SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR SAID TWO

03:28:18.886 --> 03:28:19.954
YEARS AGO SAYING I HOPE

03:28:20.020 --> 03:28:22.623
THERE'S- PEACE FOR AWHILE- IN

03:28:22.690 --> 03:28:25.125
THE IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD-

03:28:25.192 --> 03:28:26.861
MOST OF THE CHANGES ADVANCED BY

03:28:26.927 --> 03:28:29.263
THIS BILL. I BELIEVE ARE

03:28:29.330 --> 03:28:31.632
INTENDED AS WAYS TO INCENTIVIZE

03:28:31.699 --> 03:28:33.300
OF MOVEMENT TO A HEALTHY

03:28:33.367 --> 03:28:38.973
COMBINATION. OF ONLINE. AND IN

03:28:39.039 --> 03:28:39.874
PERSON LEARNING. THAT I WANT TO

03:28:39.940 --> 03:28:41.642
ANSWER THAT EVERY THAT I'VE-

03:28:41.709 --> 03:28:43.077
IN THIS BILL IS TRYING TO

03:28:43.143 --> 03:28:45.279
INCENTIVIZE OR REGULATE RIGHT

03:28:45.346 --> 03:28:46.881
SOME HEALTHY COMBINATION OF

03:28:46.947 --> 03:28:48.782
ONLINE AND IN PERSON LEARNING-

03:28:48.849 --> 03:28:50.317
AND THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL

03:28:50.384 --> 03:28:52.286
STUDENT EXCEPTIONS TO THIS

03:28:52.353 --> 03:28:54.121
PRINCIPLE FOR. FOR SUCH A- BUT

03:28:54.188 --> 03:28:55.589
THE UP TO THIS PRINCIPLE OF A

03:28:55.656 --> 03:28:57.191
COMBINATION OF ONLINE AND IN

03:28:57.258 --> 03:28:58.726
PERSON BUT CERTAINLY THE

03:28:58.792 --> 03:29:00.728
EVIDENCE IS STRONG. THAT THAT

03:29:00.794 --> 03:29:02.763
IS SUPERIOR TO JUST SIMPLY

03:29:02.830 --> 03:29:04.899
ONLINE INSTRUCTION ONLY AS- AS

03:29:04.965 --> 03:29:07.301
HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. SO FOR ME

03:29:07.368 --> 03:29:08.202
THE QUESTION IN FRONT OF US

03:29:08.269 --> 03:29:10.437
RELEASED. FOR SCHOOLS TO THE

03:29:10.504 --> 03:29:13.941
DESIRE TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS.

03:29:14.008 --> 03:29:16.176
IS IT APPROPRIATE TO USE A

03:29:16.243 --> 03:29:17.678
COMBINATION OF INCENTIVES AND

03:29:17.745 --> 03:29:19.914
REGULATIONS TO TRY TO PUSH.

03:29:19.980 --> 03:29:22.182
THOSE SCHOOLS TO HAVE A HEALTHY

03:29:22.249 --> 03:29:23.350
COMBINATION OF ONLINE AND IN

03:29:23.417 --> 03:29:26.186
PERSON. OR TO LEAVE THE STATUS

03:29:26.253 --> 03:29:28.022
QUO WHERE THEY COULD DO VERY

03:29:28.088 --> 03:29:31.458
LITTLE IN PERSON- IF ANY. AND

03:29:31.525 --> 03:29:32.760
THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I

03:29:32.826 --> 03:29:34.395
THINK IS TO THE PROVISIONS OF

03:29:34.461 --> 03:29:36.630
THIS BILL. DO THAT DO THEY

03:29:36.697 --> 03:29:38.532
APPROPRIATELY PUSH FOR ONLINE

03:29:38.599 --> 03:29:40.668
AND IN PERSON WITHOUT HAVING

03:29:40.734 --> 03:29:42.403
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE

03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:43.604
GREATER THAN THE BENEFITS LIKE

03:29:43.671 --> 03:29:45.406
THAT THAT COULD COME FROM THAT.

03:29:45.472 --> 03:29:48.175
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUES

03:29:48.242 --> 03:29:49.643
OF REQUIREMENT FOR PHYSICAL

03:29:49.710 --> 03:29:51.645
LOCATION THE REGION CREATING

03:29:51.712 --> 03:29:52.780
THE FEE FROM ONE TO THREE

03:29:52.846 --> 03:29:54.248
PERCENT. AND THE MODIFYING OF

03:29:54.315 --> 03:29:56.583
THE FUNDING FORMULA WILL FOR

03:29:56.650 --> 03:29:58.752
MOST SCHOOLS BECAUSE SOME SOME

03:29:58.819 --> 03:30:00.321
REAL ADJUSTMENTS THAT THERE

03:30:00.387 --> 03:30:01.021
WILL JUST WOULD HAVE TO BE

03:30:01.088 --> 03:30:03.157
RIGHT. BUT I BELIEVE FROM WHAT

03:30:03.223 --> 03:30:04.091
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THAT

03:30:04.158 --> 03:30:05.759
THOSE ADJUSTMENTS CAN BE MADE

03:30:05.826 --> 03:30:07.328
BY THE SCHOOLS IF THERE ARE

03:30:07.394 --> 03:30:08.562
SCHOOLS THAT ARE MAKING A GOOD

03:30:08.629 --> 03:30:10.431
FAITH EFFORT TO MEET THE NEEDS

03:30:10.497 --> 03:30:12.166
OF THEIR STUDENTS. AND ALSO

03:30:12.232 --> 03:30:14.234
FOLLOW THE SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE

03:30:14.301 --> 03:30:16.370
THAT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS

03:30:16.437 --> 03:30:17.738
SHOULD YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN

03:30:17.805 --> 03:30:19.773
BATTLING OF DEBTS IN BETTER

03:30:19.840 --> 03:30:20.975
THAN THE LAW REGARDING CHARTER

03:30:21.041 --> 03:30:22.476
SCHOOLS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP

03:30:22.543 --> 03:30:24.345
WITH WITH PUBLIC SCHOOLS. FOR

03:30:24.411 --> 03:30:25.846
EXAMPLE THE FEE INCREASED FROM

03:30:25.913 --> 03:30:28.015
1% TO THREE PERCENT. THAT CAN

03:30:28.082 --> 03:30:30.217
ONLY THAT MONEY CAN ONLY BE

03:30:30.284 --> 03:30:32.453
USED FOR MORE OVERSIGHT. AND IF

03:30:32.519 --> 03:30:33.921
IT'S NOT USED FOR OVERSIGHT FEE

03:30:33.988 --> 03:30:35.789
CAN BE CHARGED CORRECT THAT THE

03:30:35.856 --> 03:30:37.725
FEE WILL BE LESS SO IT'S ONLY

03:30:37.791 --> 03:30:39.426
IF IT IF YOU NEED IT FOR THE

03:30:39.493 --> 03:30:41.729
OVERSIGHT. AND CERTAINLY TODAY

03:30:41.795 --> 03:30:42.863
I THINK A GOOD CASE HAS BEEN

03:30:42.930 --> 03:30:44.665
MADE OF THAT MORE OVERSIGHT IS

03:30:44.732 --> 03:30:46.233
NEEDED THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF

03:30:46.300 --> 03:30:48.102
THINGS IF THIS IS COMPLICATED.

03:30:48.168 --> 03:30:50.904
TO DO THIS KIND OF OVERSIGHT

03:30:50.971 --> 03:30:52.072
IT'S COMPLICATED IN NORMAL

03:30:52.139 --> 03:30:54.108
SCHOOLS IF YOU GO TO ONLINE

03:30:54.174 --> 03:30:55.342
SCHOOLS WITH THE LACK OF

03:30:55.409 --> 03:30:56.977
PHYSICAL PRESENCE AND THE

03:30:57.044 --> 03:30:58.512
ABILITY TO TAKE LITTLE LEAGUE

03:30:58.579 --> 03:30:59.747
YOU KNOW AND DO REGISTRATION

03:30:59.813 --> 03:31:02.182
ONLINE. SO WE NEED MORE ROBUST

03:31:02.249 --> 03:31:05.085
ON OVERSIGHT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE

03:31:05.152 --> 03:31:06.153
TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING WE'RE

03:31:06.220 --> 03:31:08.722
GOING TO ONLINE ONLINE SCHOOLS.

03:31:08.789 --> 03:31:10.024
SO I THINK ALMOST EVERYBODY

03:31:10.090 --> 03:31:14.328
AGREES WE NEED WE DON'T NEED.

03:31:14.395 --> 03:31:15.262
MORE OVERSIGHT SO A FEE IAN

03:31:15.329 --> 03:31:15.763
CREASED HEALTH FOR THAT-

03:31:15.829 --> 03:31:16.930
OVERSIGHT DOES NOT. ME AS

03:31:16.997 --> 03:31:17.931
INAPPROPRIATE PARTICULAR IF

03:31:17.998 --> 03:31:19.633
IT'S ONLY ALLOWED TO BE USED

03:31:19.700 --> 03:31:20.968
FOR THE OVERSIGHT. THE

03:31:21.035 --> 03:31:23.003
REQUIREMENT OF A OF A PHYSICAL

03:31:23.070 --> 03:31:26.707
LOCATION- IS- IS A CHALLENGE

03:31:26.774 --> 03:31:27.641
FOR SOME OF THESE ONLINE

03:31:27.708 --> 03:31:29.309
SCHOOLS BUT- I WANT TO POINT

03:31:29.376 --> 03:31:32.179
OUT THAT. THE CHARTER ONLINE

03:31:32.246 --> 03:31:34.114
SCHOOLS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

03:31:34.181 --> 03:31:35.482
FLEXIBILITYTHAN TRADITIONAL

03:31:35.549 --> 03:31:37.451
SCHOOLS WHEN IT COMES TO THE

03:31:37.518 --> 03:31:42.389
ONLINE- COMMITTEE PHYSICAL

03:31:42.456 --> 03:31:44.158
THEY WOULD HAVE TO DEVELOP. SO

03:31:44.224 --> 03:31:45.325
TODAY I STILL HAVE SOME

03:31:45.392 --> 03:31:46.660
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF

03:31:46.727 --> 03:31:48.395
THE COUNTY REACHED RESTRICTIONS

03:31:48.462 --> 03:31:51.265
I APPRECIATE THAT THE- CHAIR.

03:31:51.331 --> 03:31:55.169
IS WILLING TO- WORK WITH AND

03:31:55.235 --> 03:31:57.604
EXPLORE THOSE- AS SHE'S

03:31:57.671 --> 03:32:00.040
EXPRESSED AND THEN FINALLY I

03:32:00.107 --> 03:32:00.574
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT AS A

03:32:00.641 --> 03:32:02.342
RESULT OF COVERT. ONLINE

03:32:02.409 --> 03:32:03.977
INSTRUCTION HAS ARRIVED FOR

03:32:04.044 --> 03:32:06.146
MAINSTREAM AMERICA. LIKE IT OR

03:32:06.213 --> 03:32:07.815
NOT WE GOT EXPOSED TO IT IT IS

03:32:07.881 --> 03:32:10.584
OUT THERE- AND WE IT AS FAR AS

03:32:10.651 --> 03:32:12.619
I CAN TELL HAVE NOT REALLY HAD

03:32:12.686 --> 03:32:14.288
IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE.

03:32:14.354 --> 03:32:16.390
COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATIVE

03:32:16.457 --> 03:32:19.526
EFFORT TO ADDRESS THIS EVOLVING

03:32:19.593 --> 03:32:21.829
FIELD OF EDUCATION. SO THE

03:32:21.895 --> 03:32:23.430
QUESTION IS AND I BELIEVE THAT

03:32:23.497 --> 03:32:24.832
THE OVERALL PROVISIONS OF THIS

03:32:24.898 --> 03:32:26.800
BILL PROVIDE A COMMONSENSE

03:32:26.867 --> 03:32:28.902
EFFORT TO TRY TO PROVIDE

03:32:28.969 --> 03:32:31.071
REGULATIONS NEEDED TO SUPPORT.

03:32:31.138 --> 03:32:33.474
THE CREDIBILITY OF THE ONLINE

03:32:33.540 --> 03:32:35.075
CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE MAKING

03:32:35.142 --> 03:32:36.877
A GOOD FAITH EFFORT. YOU'VE

03:32:36.944 --> 03:32:39.279
ALREADY SEEN. ALL CHARTER

03:32:39.346 --> 03:32:41.949
SCHOOLS GET TARNISHED BY THE A.

03:32:42.015 --> 03:32:44.551
THREE SCHEDULE ALL OF. SO I

03:32:44.618 --> 03:32:45.519
WOULD I WOULD HOPETHAT PEOPLE

03:32:45.586 --> 03:32:47.287
