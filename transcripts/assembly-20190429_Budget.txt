WE'RE GONNA WAIT TILL WE HAVE QUORUM AND SO IN THE INTERIM WILL START AS A SUB COMMITTEE -- WE'RE GONNA START FIRST WITH MISTER RAMOS. WHO IS PRESENTING AB THREE TWO THREE ABOUT THE MISTER DAILY WITH MR GRAYSON? RESTAURANTS IF YOU WANNA. COME FORWARD THANK YOU. IS THIS ON THERE I'M SORRY I FORGOT TO HIT THE RED BUTTON BOB SO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS I WILL BE PRESENTING ON AB THREE TWO THREE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAILY. AS WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE STATES THAT IS MOST PRONE TO NATURAL DISASTERS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED ROUGHLY SIX POINT THREE MILLION BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL GRANTS. AND THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE MOST RECENT FIRES WHICH WILL LIKELY EXCEED THREE BILLION DOLLARS. BY ESTABLISHING A DISASTER PREPAREDNESS ACCOUNT AB THREE TWO THREE WILL ENSURE THAT EVEN DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OUR STATE WILL HAVE THE NECESSARY CASH RESERVES TO PAY FOR IMMEDIATE RESPONSES AND RECOVERY. BECAUSE THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS IS OFTEN UNCERTAIN. IT IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE THE NECESSARY RESERVES ON HAND. AS WE KNOW IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE NATURAL DISASTERS QUICK RESPONSE IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDING BASIC NEEDS AND ESTABLISHING THE GROUNDWORK FOR EVENTUAL RECOVERY. ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAILY I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ARRIVAL. START ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN FAVOR. ANY WITNESSES APPROACHED. QUESTIONS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE I'M SORRY I SHOULD COME QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE FIRST -- FINANCE DEVOTE. GREG BREASTS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ADMINISTRATION HAS NO FORMAL PROPOSED. NO FORMAL POSITION ON THIS BILL WE'RE STILL EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THIS PROPOSAL. WE WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT -- WE'D LIKE TO RETAIN AS MUCH FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE. I WANTED DRESSING NEEDS FOR THE STATE CREATING A SEPARATE RESERVE FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE LIKELY REDUCES THAT FLEXIBILITY -- BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THIS ISSUE AS PART OF THE ONGOING BUDGET DISCUSSIONS. THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT. YEAH I GUESS -- MY QUESTION IS THIS IS THIS AND AND MAYBE WE CAN. WHAT YOU SAID WHAT PART OF FINANCES SAID THERE I WASN'T AWARE THAT THIS THIS IS A RESERVE ACCOUNT -- SO WHERE IS THE FRONT WEARS A FUNDING EXPECTED TO COME FROM FROM. EXIST REVENUE I MEAN WHERE WHERE WE WERE HAPPY IT SAYS THERE'S NO THERE THE BILL WILL HAVE NO COST BUT WE HAVE. SO WE CREATE A FUND WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM SO. THE SERVER WOULD THEM THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS AS PART OF THE REASON FOR THE RESERVE THIS THERE SO THAT WE HAVE AMPLE TIME TO GET THAT REIMBURSEMENT BACK FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY WOULD THEN GO INTO THIS THIS A RESERVE. HEAR ME IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WOULD HAVE NEED TO BE SOME SEED MONEY PUT INTO THE ACCOUNT EITHER FROM THE GENERAL FUND OR FROM SOME OTHER FUNDING SOURCES TO GET IT. YOU KNOW -- FILLED UP TO TWO IS A STARTING POINT. SO IS ANYBODY GIVEN A THOUGHT TO WHAT THAT NUMBER MIGHT BE. FINANCES NOT -- DETERMINE ANY SPECIFIC A THRESHOLD DOLLAR AMOUNT. DESCRIPTION I WILL I WILL TRY MY BEST. I'VE ALWAYS REYES LARYNGITIS YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM -- BUT AS WE WE ALREADY REIMBURSE AND WE ALREADY ADDRESS EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WELL BUT IT'S OUT OF THE IF I UNDERSTAND IT QUICKLY. THE MAIN RESERVE ACCOUNTS. AND WHAT THIS WOULD SIMPLY DO IS CREATE A A WAY THAT WE CAN BETTER TRACK. FEMALE -- PAYMENTS THE TIMING OF IT AND THEN ALSO BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SHOULD BE PUT AWAY. FOR EMERGENCIES IN THE FUTURE. BASED ON HEALTH REIMBURSEMENTS COME IN AND HOW THEY'RE DISPERSED. SO IT'S REALLY SERVING MORE TO ADD GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND TRACKING -- DATA AS FAR AS WE SEATS AND DISBURSEMENTS. THANK YOU -- MISTER WILL. TAKE IT WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE THE ALSO FOR YOU AND STATE LAW SAYS THAT WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE SFU GETS ABOVE A CERTAIN POINT. THAT TRIGGERS AN AUTOMATIC ONE QUARTER PERCENTAGE POINT REDUCTION IN THE STATEWIDE SALES TAX SO EVERY TIME SOMEONE PROPOSES CREATING A NEW RESERVE ACCOUNT WHAT I THINK IN MY MIND IS THAT DELAYS THE DATE WHEN WE'RE GOING TO GIVE. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA A REDUCTION ON THEIR SALES TAX AND THIS IS A NEW YEAR WHEN WE HAVE A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS I THINK THAT WE ARE WE SHOULD HAVE LET THE SFU EXCEED THAT AMOUNT. BOB HOWEVER IN THIS CASE I'M GONNA GO AGAINST THAT. WHAT WHAT I DO REGULARLY AND VOTE FOR IT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY THINK THAT YOU BRING SOME EXCELLENT POINTS UP WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE STATE'S NEED -- FOR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS THESE ARE TRULY -- AYE AYE -- CIRCUMSTANCES FOR WHICH WE NEED TO HAVE A SEPARATE RESERVE ACCOUNT ACCOUNT SET ASIDE AND THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY CAN'T FORESEE WHEN THE NEED MIGHT OCCUR THAT WE NEED TO TAP INTO THAT SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE US TO TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE SEPARATE RESERVE ACCOUNTS BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT. THE PEOPLE OF CAL CALIFORNIA DESERVE THAT ONE QUARTER PERCENT REDUCTION IN THEIR SALES TAX RATE. THANK YOU IT JUST ADDITIONAL CLARIFYING DOCTOR WHICH QUESTION SO. THIS ACCOUNT PART THE REASON FOR THIS ACCOUNT IS. BECAUSE IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN NUMEROUS EXPENDITURES ALL COME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES. THIS WOULD REALLY ALLOW US TO HAVE A MUCH CLEARER COUNTING ON WHAT'S BEING SPENT. ON SPECIFIC DISASTERS WHAT IS ALSO OCCURRING IN WHERE THAT MONEY IS COMING FROM BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S SORT OF A A MISHMASH OF PLACES DEPENDING ON THOSE DEPARTMENTS. IT WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY BECAUSE FRANKLY THESE DISASTERS WERE ONE OFFS AND THEY WERE INFREQUENT NOW THAT THEY'VE BECOME UNFORTUNATELY ALMOST AN ANNUAL OCCURRENCE. WE WE FIND THE NEED. TO TAKE A MUCH CLOSER LOOK HAVE A MUCH MORE SET GUIDELINE OF PRINCIPLES AND AND PERHAPS A SEPARATE COUNTY SO WE'RE REALLY UNDERSTAND IT MAKE SURE THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY. GETTING TO WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BECAUSE WE ARE APPROPRIATING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT TO DO WITH THESE DISASTERS WHICH I THINK IS COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT'S EASY TO TRACK THAT MONEY AS WELL. ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I'LL GO BACK -- ANY. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUPPORT. THE PUBLIC COMMENT OPPOSED. MR ALMOST DID YOU WANNA CLOSE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU -- WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR FOR SO WE'LL BE TAKING THAT PROPOSAL UP WE HAVE COR THANK YOU. MR OBERNOLTE HAS TO PROPOSALS IN FROM THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. MR WILL NOTICE PRESENTING ECA ELEVEN AS WELL AS AB. EIGHT FIFTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WITH YOUR PERMISSION WILL START WITH A CA. ELEVEN I'M SURE WE'LL ALL AWARE OF THIS COMMITTEE OF THE GREAT WORK THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S DOES IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE'S MISSION. BUT THEY'VE BEEN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR BUDGETING PROCESS AND OR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SINCE THEY WERE FORMED IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE OF COURSE THEIR FORM. TO BE A COUNTERPOINT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN. NINETEEN NINETY PROPOSITION ONE FORTY PASSED WHICH PASSED STRICT REGULATION AND CAPS ON LEGISLATIVE SPENDING UNFORTUNATELY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS INCLUDED UNDERNEATH THE PROP ONE FORTY CAPS. PRIOR TO NINETEEN NINETY THE LA -- DID ANALYSIS NOT JUST OF THE BUDGET BUT OF EVERY SINGLE BILL THAT WENT BEFORE THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE THAT ANALYSIS WAS ARE NOT ONLY TIMELY BUT ALSO VERY HELPFUL IN EATING THE LEGISLATURE. IN NAVIGATING THE THE MAZE OF ALL THOSE BILLS AGO BEFORE APPROPRIATIONS AFTER PROP ONE FORTY PASSED THE STAFF OF THE LA -- WAS CUT BY OVER 60% AND IT IS NEVER BEEN RESTORED TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE LA -- CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT AS MUCH STAFF AS THEY HAD IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AND THE STATE BUDGET AND THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAMS HAVE INCREASED OVER 5000% SINCE THEM. SO THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ACA ELEVEN WOULD REMOVE THE LA -- FROM UNDERNEATH THE PROP ONE FORTY CAPS A ON THE ALLOW US TO BE TO RESTORE THE LA -- TO CLOSER TO WHAT THEIR ORIGINAL MISSION WAS. NORMALLY I'M A SMALL GOVERNMENT PERSON NORMALLY I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF EXPANDING ANY DEPARTMENT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IN THIS CASE I MAKE AN EXCEPTION BECAUSE THE ONLY I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE FISCAL WATCHDOG. FOR NOT ONLY STATE SPENDING WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THAT DEPARTMENT I WANT TO HAVE AS MANY STAFF AS THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB SO. I I THINK THIS IS A GREAT THING FOR NOT ONLY OUR FISCAL CONSERVANCY BUT ALSO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA DOWN AT THE PROPER TIME WOULD REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON A SCALE OF GET THE PART OF FINANCE. KRISTIN SHELTON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THIS AND PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE GENERAL FUND COST PRESSURES THAT COULD EXIST IF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST IS CARVED OUT. OF THE LEGISLATURE'S SPENDING AND THEN THERE WOULD BE COST FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO PUT THIS MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. THANK YOU BEFORE WE GO TO THE COMMITTEE CAN WE TAKE ROLE TO ESTABLISH MORE. KING HERE OBERNOLTE [inaudible] PRO. TO COOPER YEAH FONG. FRAZIER [inaudible] GARCIA. JONES SAWYER LACKEY LIMóN. MATHIS [inaudible] MEDINA [inaudible] MELENDEZ. MULLIN MURATSUCHI NAZARIAN O'DONNELL [inaudible] PATTERSON. MOST. REYES REVERSE [inaudible] STONE. WEBER HERE WICKS HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE CALM EXPRESS THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SO MISTER OBERNOLTE YOU AND I HAVE THIS -- DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BILL A MONTH OR SO AGO AND I STILL HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS YOU YOU SEEK TO REMOVE. THE SPENDING CAP FOR THE LA YEAH THAT'S WHAT THIS WOULD DO RIGHT. NOT QUITE WHAT I PROPOSE YOU TO DO IS TO MOVE THE LA -- OUT FROM THE EXISTING PROP ONE FORTY SPENDING CAP FOR THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT THAT CAP WOULD STILL EXIST FOR THE LEGISLATURE BUT THE LA -- WOULD EXIST INDEPENDENTLY OF THAT CAP AND THEY DON'T GET BUDGET EVERY YEAR AS EVERY OTHER DEPARTMENT THIS THERE'S NO CAP PLACED ON HOW MUCH THEY COULD RECEIVE IS NOT SPECIFICALLY IN THE LA ALBEIT AN ITEM FOR NEGOTIATION EACH YEAR WHEN WE SAT THERE BUDGET. AND SO -- PROP ONE FIFTY EIGHT WHICH WAS PRESENTED TO THE VOTERS IN -- NINETEEN NINETEEN NINETY TWO YEAH -- WAS REJECTED BY THE VOTERS THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO THE VERY THING THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT WE SHOULD DO TODAY BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE. WITH -- ALLOWING THEM TO BE SEPARATED AND ALSO NOT TO HAVE ANY SORT OF CONSTITUTIONAL CAP SO I'M JUST WONDERING -- I GUESS. YOU ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE VOTERS WOULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY THIS TIME I AM AT AGE IS ACTUALLY QUESTION BECAUSE AS YOU SAY PROP ONE FIFTY EIGHT WAS REJECTED BY THE VOTERS NINETEEN NINETY TWO BUT I THINK THAT THE LA -- GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE BACKLASH OF VOTER OPINION AGAINST THE LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATURE WAS VERY UNPOPULAR WITH VOTERS AT THAT TIME AND THAT'S WHY PROP ONE FORTY WAS. ONE YOU SEEN NOW. I PLEAD THE FIFTH. BUT I I DO THINK THAT THE SETTLEMENT IS IS VERY DIFFERENT NOW THE POLITICAL CLIMATE VERY DIFFERENT NOW THAN IT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO I ALSO THINK THAT. WE DIDN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF ARTICULATING THE CASE FOR WHY THE ONLY -- EXISTS AND WHY WE NEED A STRONG AND INDEPENDENT LA -- TO COUNTERBALANCE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND HOW THE LA -- ACTUALLY HELPS TO SAVE TAXPAYER MONEY SO -- I WOULD ARGUE THAT A DOLLAR INVESTED NEARLY DO YOU YIELDS MANY DOLLARS BACK AND TAXPAYER SAVINGS -- AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT. OKAY AND I APPRECIATE THAT I GUESS I'M JUST WARNING HOP I MEAN THE QUESTION WE'RE GOING TO BE PRESENTING TO VOTERS IS WE ARE NOT THE QUESTION WHAT THE REQUEST IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE. NOT ONLY THE MONEY THAT YOU CURRENTLY GIVE THE STATE FOR THAT -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT NOW WE WANT MORE MONEY FOR THE LA IS OFFICE TO DO THE EXACT SAME JOB. THAT IS ESSENTIALLY CORRECT HOWEVER THE REASON WHY THE LA WAS INSTITUTED IS BECAUSE A PRIOR TO THE THE PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF THE PART IN A FINANCE. WE REALLY HAD NO PROFESSIONAL FINANCE STAFF AT ALL IN CALIFORNIA AND WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS STARTED THAT WAS -- IT MINISTRATION PERSONNEL THAT WAS BASICALLY HIRED TO PUT TOGETHER THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET AND THE LEGISLATURE QUICKLY REALIZE THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROFESSIONAL. OPINIONS OF OUR OWN TO BE ABLE TO COUNTERACT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WAS PROPOSING TO DO SO BASICALLY WE COULD BELIEVE THE DEAL AFTER. WITH ALL RESPECT YOU KNOW OR NOT BELIEVE THEM BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANY FACTS WHAT WERE EXPERT PERSONNEL TO BACK US UP AND THAT'S WHY THERE IS AN ALLEY OKAY BECAUSE THAT THAT TENSION IS ALWAYS GOING TO EXIST BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT TENSION IS A GOOD THING. AND YOU'VE YOU DN'T FEEL HAT THE POLICY ANALYST -- EMPLOYED BY THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS IN OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS ARE ENOUGH TO SATISFY. THE INCREASE THAT ARE MADE BY MEMBERS WITH RESPECT TO HAVE SPENDING. NO I DO NOT AND I THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE SWITCHED FROM SPECIALLY OUR SIDE OF THE AISLE ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO CUT A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER POLICY CAUCUS STAFF IN RECENT YEARS. BECAUSE OF BUDGETARY PRESSURES YOU KNOW WITHIN OUR OWN CAUCUS AND AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A HEALTHY THING I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE WHOSE WHOSE JOB IN FULL TIME OCCUPATION IS ANALYZING THE FISCAL IMPACTS OF LEGISLATION ON THE TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA. THANKS FOR THE GREAT QUESTIONS. IT WAS FRAZIER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I KNOW IS A POLICY CHAIR THAT I HAVE BEEN -- UTILIZING THE ALEJO'S ANALYSIS ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT FACETS. AND THE UNBIASED APPROACH THAT THEY TAKE. HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO ME IN. ACTUALLY. NECESSITATING GOING ON TOURS OR WHATEVER SO I I REALLY WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AS A AN OPPORTUNITY -- THAT AUGMENTS MY STAFF FOR MY COMMITTEE STAFF -- ABILITY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS SO I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOU BRING WAS WHERE I REALLY THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL. THAT WE EXPAND THEIR ABILITIES ALSO. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. HOW TO SAY I'M I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS PROPOSAL WE? CAME THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL AS MR ABILITY MYSELF FOR GOING THROUGH THE LA -- HIRING PROCESS REALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD BECOME FRANKLY BECAUSE OF TERM LIMITS THE NUMBER OF THE REASONS. THEY COME A FAIRLY WEAK BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT WE ARE WE ARE A THREE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT SYSTEM. I THINK MISS MELENDEZ PRESENT EXCELLENT POINT ASKING YOU KNOW WE HAVE -- FISCAL STOP FROM BOTH THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE THE REPUBLICAN SIDE IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY. I THINK THE THE LA -- HAD SOMETHING THAT REALLY -- OUR DAY TO DAY. FISCAL STAFF CAN'T DO WHICH IS OUR FISCAL STAFF ARE VERY MUCH ACTING TO VERY SPECIFIC -- BUDGET PROPOSALS AND HEAD DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY OF POSITIONS SO THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY IN THE OPERATIONS OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS WHERE I WAS THE LA -- REALLY AS AS MISTER FRAZIER POINT OUT CAN BE LOOKING AT ISSUES LOOKING AT LONGER TERM ISSUES I KNOW ONE ISSUE. THAT I'D WISH THEY HAD REALLY BEEN ABLE TO HELP. MORE ON AND FRANKLY IT'S OUR FAULT APPOINT NOT ENGAGE IN THE EARLY NAM WAS REALLY ON THIS WILDFIRE ISSUE ON THIS DISASTER ISSUE SOMETHING THAT. THEY COULD HELP TAKE A MUCH LONGER VIEW -- WHERE IS OUR STAFF IS REALLY? MEANT TO DO WITH THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY THE DAY TO DAY BUSINESS SO -- I I REALLY APPRECIATE MISTRAL MULTI YOU BRING THIS FORWARD AND HAVE AN OUT BY PARTS SUPPOSED TO THIS RIPPLES I THINK IT IS VERY NECESSARY. GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE SEEN -- I DON'T THINK EVEN MENTIONED THAT THE STAFFING COMPARISON BETWEEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LA L. M. L. L. HAS ABOUT FIFTY STAFF I BELIEVE DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAS IS A FOR A FOUR HUNDRED STAFF AND MY AND KRISTIN SHELTON AGAIN WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT STAFF HOWEVER -- HUGE PERCENTAGE ABOUT STAFF A LITTLE BIT OVER HALF ARE NOT ACTUALLY DOING IT THE BUDGET AND FISCAL OVERSIGHT WE HAVE OUR AUDIT AND EVALUATION ARM. AND WE ALSO HAVE OUR SUPPORT OF WORK THAT WE DO FROM AN ACCOUNTING PERSPECTIVE FOR THE STATE THANK YOU THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT. EVEN IF YOU JUST NOW 220-020-0 VERSES THE THE FIFTY AND AGAIN -- YEAH WE THINK I THINK THIS PUZZLE'S LONG OVERDUE WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE OUR VICE CHAIR FOR BRING IT FORWARD. I WAS GOING TO OFF ASK IF THERE'S ANY TESTIMONY IN FAVOR OF THIS PROPOSAL. THE PUBLIC COMMENT IN FAVOR. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT AGAINST. CANNOT SEE ANY WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MA'AM SECRETARY COULD YOU CALL THE ROLL TRACY. ELEVEN KING HI TING AYE OBERNOLTE FIVE REALTY I BLOOM. BLOOM HI BRO. BRO HI CHIU COOPER. COOPER HI FONG.

FIFTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I KNOW EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE IS AWARE OF NOT ONLY THE PROMISE OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING BUT ALSO. THE PROBLEMS AND DELAYS THAT HAVE RECENTLY PLAGUED THAT PRO THE AUDITOR CAME BACK WITH A QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND ALSO SOME VERY ALARMING STATISTICS ON HIS CAL. AND PARTICULARLY THE AUDITOR WAS CONCERNED AT THAT THE SLOW PROGRESS IN DEPLOYING PHYS CAL WAS GOING TO BECAUSE THE DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS TO NOT BE ABLE TO RELIABLY REPORT. THEIR REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE FIGURES AND THAT THAT MIGHT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE STATE'S CREDIT RATING. UNFORTUNATELY THE THAT TURNED OUT TO BE OPPRESSION OBSERVATION BECAUSE JUST LAST MONTH STATE COMPTROLLER BETTY SENT A LETTER TO THE LEGISLATURE WHICH I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL READ. THAT -- EXPRESSED THAT EXACT SAME CONCERN AND IN A MUCH MORE NEAR TERM WAY IN FACT AS SHE IT IN PREPARING TO ISSUE THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT THE SO CALLED CFR. SHE IS CONCERNED THAT PERHAPS THE STATE AUDITOR'S WILL RETURN A WERE A KID A QUALIFIED -- AUDIT OF FINDING INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF A SUPPORTIVE FINDING AND THAT THAT MIGHT CAUSE OUR CREDIT RATING TO DECLINE SO THIS BILL MERELY IMPLEMENTS SOME OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR THAT WOULD THEY WOULD IMPOSE. SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON HIS CAL SO THAT WE GET OUR ARMS AROUND THE ARE LEGISLATIVE ROLE IN -- OVERSEEING THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM SO -- WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE A THANK YOU -- DEPARTMENT FINANCE.

B. -- SORRY MISS REVIEWS AB SEVENTEEN FOURTEEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE MISS SHELTON FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE PRESENT ON MISSION BASED BUDGETING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY IN FRONT OF THE FULL COMMITTEE WITH TYPICALLY PROVIDED UPDATES REGULAR UPDATES SINCE WE STARTED THIS UNIT IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN TO ASSEMBLY SUBCOMMITTEE SIX AND AND SO SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE BEEN FAIRLY BUSY ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A VERY SMALL TEAM A LITTLE LESS THAN FIVE STAFF DEDICATED TO THIS IMPORTANT WORK FINANCE. AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE PROVIDED SOME DOCUMENTS THAT PROVIDED -- BROAD SUMMARY OR AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WHAT WORK THIS UNIT DOES TODAY -- AND WHAT WE'VE COMPLETED SINCE OUR LAST UPDATE INCLUDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE REPORT AFTER APPROACH THE UNIT ORG CHART. AND A LIST OF OUR CURRENT PROJECTS THAT ARE UNDER WAY AS WELL AS AS ONE PAGE SUMMARY OF OUR FINDINGS ON THOSE REPORTS -- SINCE WE'VE HAD SINCE WE WERE CREATED WE HAVE COMPLETED THREE REVIEWS AND THESE ARE FAIRLY LABOR INTENSIVE AND WE HAVE CURRENTLY FIVE REVIEWS UNDER PRODUCT -- IN PROGRESS. AND THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE TAKEN HERE IS KIND OF UNIQUE AND IT REALLY APPLIES AN ALTERNATIVE BUDGETING METHODOLOGY TO THE INCREMENTAL BUDGET PROCESS THAT WE CURRENTLY TAKE -- TO BUILD THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR BUDGET -- BY REALLY WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR DEPARTMENT PARTNERS -- IN TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE REQUIREMENTS THAT DRIVE THE MISSION OF THAT ORGANIZATION BOTH A VERY CLEARLY DEFINED STATUTORY MISSION AS WELL AS THE EXPECTATIONS OF LET'S SAY SERVICE LEVELS THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED BY THOSE DEPARTMENTS AND TO CALIFORNIANS -- AS WELL AS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT MIGHT BE AFFECTED. AND WE PRIORITIZE AS BEST WE CAN THE LIMITED RESOURCES OF THE STATE AND REALLY TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING A BIG RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS AND THAT THEIR TARGETED AND STRATEGIC. AND WE HAVE HAD A VARIETY OF FINDING SINCE SINCE WE CREATED THE UNIT -- IT CAN BE AN REDUCTION AND RESOURCES THAT CAN THE ADDITION OF RESOURCES -- AND I THINK COMING OUT OF RECESSION AND WE HAVE SEEN NOT TO BE MOST OFTEN THE CASE -- WHICH WHICH PRESUMES THAT THERE'S HIGHER SERVICE LEVEL NEEDS IN THOSE PARTICULAR ADAM PROPOSALS ARE PACKAGES THAT MIGHT HAVE COME BEFORE YOU. WE ALSO THINK ABOUT IS THERE UNDERLYING MISSION CHANGED OR HAS IT BEEN MODIFIED SO WE WILL COME FORWARD WITH PROPOSALS THAT CHANGE THAT MISSION THROUGH BUDGET TRAILER BILL TYPICALLY -- BUT COULD ALSO TAKE A POLICY PASSED DEPENDING ON HOW IT AFFECTS THE RESOURCES OF THAT DEPARTMENT. AND WE TRY TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES ARE PLACES WHERE WE CAN STREAMLINE FUNCTION FUNCTIONS ARE CONSOLIDATE FUNCTIONS AND THEN WE REALLY LOOK AT REGIONAL APPROACHES TO SERVICE DELIVERIES -- I THINK PROBABLY THE BEST HIGHLIGHTED ONE IS WITHIN OUR STATE HOSPITAL PROGRAM WHICH HAS FIVE DISTINCT HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE A WIDER. RANGE OF SERVICES WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING OUT WAYS TO STANDARDIZE AND STREAMLINE THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED SO THAT EACH HOSPITAL DOESN'T TAKE THEIR OWN APPROACH TO THE CARE OF THOSE BETTER AND COMMITTED THERE. AND WE WE DO VIEW THIS AS A VERY IMPORTANT COOPERATIVE WORK EFFORT THAT WE UNDERTAKE WITH OUR DEPARTMENTS WITH OUR AGENCY PARTNERS AND TRY -- TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WHERE THE PRIORITIES LIE AND WHERE OUR PAIN POINTS ARE AND IN TERMS OF LONG STANDING PROBLEMS OR ISSUES. I'M ONE THING THAT WE'VE NOTICED AS THIS PROCESS IT DONE RIGHT IS VERY LABOR INTENSIVE AND I THINK AS WE'VE TALKED BEFORE WE DON'T WANT TO SACRIFICE QUALITY FOR SPEED AND SO WE'VE TAKEN NOT VERY MUCH TO HEART -- BUT WE'VE ALSO LOOKED FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY. TO BRING THE CULTURE THE IDEA OF MISSION BASED REVIEWS INTO OUR BROADER BUDGET DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND SO STARTING LAST YEAR WE FORMALISE THE PROCESS THAT WE KIND OF CALL EARLY ENGAGEMENT. IN WHICH WE WORK TO IDENTIFY A FEW HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES IN SPECIFIC POLICY OR PROGRAM AREAS -- IN ADVANCE OF OUR TYPICAL TYPICAL BUDGET KICK OFF PROCESS AND THEN WE DO SOME VERY FOCUSED TARGETED MEETINGS WITH THOSE DEPARTMENTS -- AND AGENCIES TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME LONG STANDING PROBLEMS AND TWO EXAMPLES OF FAT THAT WERE INCLUDED IN OUR JANUARY TEN BUDGET -- BOTH THIS YEAR AND ALSO HAD A A PROPOSAL LAST YEAR -- FOCUSED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THEN ANOTHER PROPOSAL FOCUSED ON AND THE AT ALPHABET AT ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL. PROGRAM AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A TOPIC UP LATER IN THE AGENDA. RELATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO I WILL PROBABLY WAIT TO TALK ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR PROPOSAL INTO THAT AND TOPIC IS UP IN THE AGENDA. I'M JUST FOR CONTEXT OR AN IDEA FOR ABC THOUGH THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL DEPARTMENT. WE HAD ORIGINALLY IDENTIFIED IT AS A MISSION BASED REVIEW WE HAD COME TO THIS COMMITTEE -- TO TO UNDERTAKE THAT WE INTENDED TO START IT AND KICKED IT OFF IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THEY HAD A MUCH MORE IMMEDIATE NEED RELATIVE -- TO THEIR FUNDING STRUCTURE AND KIND OF A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AND THAT'S WHERE WE IDENTIFIED IT AND IN A PIVOTED. TO AN EARLY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AND ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT THE EFFORTS THAT WE DO IS THAT WE DO VIEW IT AS NIMBLE AND TRYING TO BE RELEVANT WHEN TOPICS OR ISSUES COME UP. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY NEED TO MEET SOME OF THE BUDGET DEADLINES THAT -- EXCESS SO WITH ABC WE PUT FORWARD A PACKAGE WAS PART OF THE APRIL ONE SPRING RELEASE AND WE HAD HOPED TO COMPLETE IT SOONER BUT IT TOOK A LITTLE LONGER AGAIN -- FOCUSING ON QUALITY NOT DOING IT AND TOO FAST. AND THAT PROPOSAL THAT'S BEING CONSIDERED BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WILL INCREASE THEIR LICENSING AND ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY. IT KIND OF TRANSFERS AND CENTRALIZES THERE'S THAT LICENSING FUNCTIONS INTO A SINGLE DIVISION WITHIN THE TO THE DEPARTMENT SO I VIEW THAT AS REALLY STREAMLINING THAT SO THAT THEY CAN -- KIND OF BY FOR KATE THE WORK THAT THEY DO IN THE FIELD. IT REESTABLISHES THEIR ABILITY TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS AND ADDRESS A SUBSTANTIAL BACKLOG OF REGULATORY ISSUES SO LOOKING AT THAT ORGANIZATION THERE HAD BEEN A LOT OF STATUS QUO FOR MANY YEARS AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO KIND OF RE LOOK AT WHAT DRIVES THEIR OVERSIGHT AND DIDN'T THEY ARE ALSO. LOOKING AT WAYS TO MODERNIZE THEIR ONLINE -- PROCESSING OF LICENSING APPLICATIONS AND BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE FINDS. YEAH AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERNAL AYE AUTOMATION THEY HAVE STAYED LARGELY A PAPER BASED DEPARTMENT -- AND AND THEN AS I SAID BECAUSE OF THE OPERATING SHORTFALL THEY HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD INCREASE THEIR FEES -- IN MANY AREAS AND LET'S SEE -- I DO HAVE I CAN PROVIDE IF YOU'D LIKE A BRIEF UPDATE ON EACH OF THE OTHER PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU THAT ARE REALLY DIRECT RESULT OF MISSION BASED REVIEW. IF THAT'S HELPFUL EXISTE ONE WE GO TO QUESTIONS MAYBE THAT'LL BE COVERED AS WE GO TO QUESTIONS. QUICK QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] COMMENTS [inaudible] MR GALLAGHER [inaudible] SO -- I GUESS THIS PROPOSAL JUST SEEMS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF THE ORDINARY -- WE'RE DOING THE NO. I THINK I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTER OF PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING I THINK A LOT OF US ARE -- BUT WHERE WE KIND OF GOING OUT OF THAT PROCESS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE. THE BILL HERE FOR ONE DEPARTMENT WHICH IS A HELLO IT'S NOT DALY LARGE HELLO SORRY GO SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THAT ONE YEAH WE'RE WE'RE SORRY WE'RE NOT ON THIS RUBIO WAS BUILT IN THE SHELTER IS JUST GIVING A UPDATE COMMISSION BASE BY THE OKAY. OKAY REDDIT BUT YOU COULD YOU COULD ADDRESS MAYBE YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW LIKE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S BEEN IT SEEMS LIKE THAT MISSION THE MISSION BASED BUDGETING THIS PROCESS IS BEING GOING PRETTY WELL -- AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BILL THAT'S GOING TO SORT PROPOSED TO TAKE ONE DEPARTMENT OUT OF THAT -- AND KINDA SINGLE THAT OUT -- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS. ON WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE DOING. SURE SO MISSION BASED BUDGETING IS. ALSO VERY LABOR INTENSIVE I MEAN I AM PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING IS ALSO VERY LABOR INTENSIVE IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TRIED IN THE PAST -- IT'S BEEN SOME TIME SO BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND NINETY THREE I WAS WITH THE DEPARTMENT WHEN WE ON WOUND ABOUT PROCESS SO WE DIDN'T FOR DEPARTMENTS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS GENERAL SERVICES AND ONE OF OUR DATA CENTERS. WHICH IS -- KIND OF A COMBINED THING TODAY -- WE CANCELED THAT PROJECT AFTER THREE YEARS BECAUSE OVERALL WE VIEWED IT AS UNSUCCESSFUL IT'S REALLY HARD TO KIND OF IDENTIFY METRICS TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE FUNDING LEVEL FOR PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT -- WHEN I THINK ABOUT A PROGRAM LIKE MEDICAID ALL AND ITS ENTITLEMENT NATURE I THINK IT BECOMES EVEN MORE CHALLENGING -- BUT AS THEY TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLY ENGAGEMENT EFFORT WE HAVE DONE A COUPLE THINGS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS RELATIVE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES BECAUSE WE NOTED THAT THERE WAS SOME FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY THAT NEEDED TO BE SHORED UP WITHIN THAT DEPARTMENT AND SO WE HAVE ADDED -- IN OUR SCHEDULE AND TRY TO BRING THAT BRING THEM EARLIER I'M IN A COUPLE AREAS BOTH IN MENTAL HEALTH AND IN THEIR FISCAL OVERSIGHT. AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ESTIMATE. I WOULD JUST CAN ALSO AND WHEN THIS RUBIO PRESENTED THE BILL AND STOP -- SIX SHE EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO REALLY WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS WITH DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE OUT HOW -- TO GET BOTH GOALS ACCOMPLISHED SO I KNOW THAT SHE CHOSE. THE PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING LABEL BUT I THINK SHE EXPRESSED A DEFINITE INTEREST IN REALLY WORKING TOGETHER SO I KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW WE'RE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL TO MOVE IT FORWARD -- THE INTENTION I BELIEVE FOR THE AUTHOR WAS THAT SHE WAS GOING TO WORK WITH BERMAN OF FINANCE AND THE COMMITTEE. TO TO KIND OF WORK TOGETHER -- ANY PARTICULAR AT THAT PARTICULAR -- DEPARTMENT. CAME OUT ON THE FUN THAT THAT BILL CAME OUT OF SOME FRUSTRATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONCE IF YOU IF YOU WERE ON SUB. ONE YOU'RE YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THEY ARE SO I THINK THAT'S WHY THERE WAS -- MISTER MATHIS IS SHAKING SENT. IN AN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY WHY WE WERE -- ENCOURAGING MISS RUBIO TO MOVE THE BILL FOR BUT THE SAME TIME TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO WORK BUT APARTMENT A FINANCE SO THAT WE COULD. HAVE IT HAS ONE ON ONE PROGRAM RATHER THAN TWO I THINK YOU BRING UP AN EXCELLENT POINT MISTER FUNK. FROM FROM A FROM A DAY TO DAY OPERATIONAL LEVEL CAN YOU CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MISSION BASE REVIEW AND PERFORM PERFORMANCE SPACE REVIEW. I MEAN YOU SAID IS VERY. INTENSIVE LABOR WISE SOUTHWEST. SO FIRST FIRST I WILL SAY THAT -- CALIFORNIA'S CONSTANTLY AN INNOVATOR AND LEADER WE REALLY LOOK KIND OF COINED THIS PHRASE MISSION BASE REVIEW BECAUSE WE FELT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON UNDERLYING STATUTE. OF A PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION AND REALLY EXAMINE OUR FOR IT ARE THEY DOING WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS. AND AND REALLY TRYING TO GET -- KIND OF INSIGHT INTO THAT PROCESS THROUGH A CLOSE AND CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE UNDERLYING STATUTORY FRAMEWORK THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND THEN WHAT KIND OF SERVICE LEVEL DO WE WANT TO HAVE -- RELATIVE TO STAFFING AND RESOURCING OUR DEPARTMENTS PARTICULARLY WHEN RESOURCES GET -- MORE LIMITED AND TIGHT PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT KIND OF SETS A PARTICULAR GOAL OR TARGET FOREIGN ORGANIZATION AND THEN DEPENDING ON HOW THEY'RE DOING AND MEETING THAT BENCHMARK OR THAT TARGET. THEY WOULD COME IN AND THEN INCREASE RESOURCES OR POTENTIALLY DECREASE SO IF THE DEPARTMENT WASN'T PERFORMING WELL AND IT WAS -- THAT THERE WAS SOME THOUGHT -- TO NO BETTER SHORING UP HOW THEY PERFORM YOU MIGHT GIVE THEM MORE RESOURCES BUT YOU MIGHT ALSO USE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PENALIZE THEM FOR NOT PERFORMING IN A PARTICULAR FASHION -- SO THERE THERE'S A REAL DISTINCTION IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO I THINK MOST STATES -- DO. IN USE PERFORMANCE METRICS TO INFLUENCE OR INFORM BUDGET CONVERSATIONS I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT FROM AN APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY. BUT WE DON'T LET THOSE METRICS DRIVE BUDGET DECISIONS -- AND ON A MORE OF AN AUTO PILOT TYPE MODE. ENGINE JUST AS A FOLLOW UP. IS. IS A PERFORMANCE METRIC CONSIDERED AS PART OF A MISSION BASED REVIEW -- I I GUESS I'M I'M SEEING A DISTINCTION. WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE BUT IN TERMS OF FROM A FROM A BUDGETARY SAMPLING. WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO INCORPORATE WHETHER THEY'RE ACHIEVING WHAT. THE GOAL OF LOCAL THE LEGISLATURE IS OR WHAT THE GOAL OF THE OF ANY PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS IN TERMS OF WHETHER THEY ARE. DESERVING OR NOT DESERVING OF A BUNCH OF RESOURCES. I'M CERTAINLY THAT'S A COMPONENT SO TYPICALLY THE WAY THAT THAT SHOWS UP IN OUR BUDGET DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AS WE MAY WANT TO INCREASE SAY A LEVEL OF SERVICE OR ELIMINATE A BACKLOG. IN SOME WORK SO WE PROVIDE RESOURCES WE MAY SET UP REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WHETHER THAT BE TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO FINANCE OR ANOTHER TYPE OF OVERSIGHT INTO T.. AND WE WOULD PROVIDE REGULAR UPDATES IN NOT SO WE DO DO A LOT A WHAT I WOULD CALL A DATA DRIVEN DECISION -- BUT SOMETIMES WHEN WE THINK ABOUT PERFORMANCE IT MIGHT BE OKAY FOR PROCESSING TO TAKE SIXTY DAYS RATHER THAN THIRTY DAYS AND THEN YOU COULD FIND AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL IF YOU MADE SOME OF THOSE TRADE OFFS AND IN THE MISSION BASED REVIEW PROCESS WE VIEW. THAT AS AN AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THOSE PARTICULAR TRADE OFFS -- AND TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MIGHT EITHER INVEST RESOURCES OR IN IN THE EXAMPLE THAT ARE PROVIDED FOR A. B. C. WE KIND OF PULLED A PROCESS OUT. FROM AN EXISTING PROCESS AND TRY TO SET IT UP ON ITS OWN SO COULD BE BETTER MINE MONITORED AND TRACK -- IN TERMS OF LICENSING AND BEING ABLE -- TO ISSUE THOSE IN A SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE ONE THING I WOULD JUST REALLY APPRECIATE PER FINANCE FOR FOR LEADING ON THIS ISSUE I KNOW. IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS THEY ARE ON THE SMALLER SIDE COULD PURPOSELY -- WANTING. TO GET THIS PROCESS GOING WITH SOME OF THE SMALLER DEPARTMENTS IN HOPES THAT WE WE WORK UP TO SOME OF THE LARGE PARTNERS. BUT THEN AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU AND FRANKLY DEPARTMENTS FOR STEPPING FORWARD TO NOSE TIME ON THE DEPARTMENT'S -- SIDE ACROSS THE TIME ON THE ON THE ON FINANCE ASIDE TO REALLY APPRECIATE IT THIS PROCESS SO. WITH THAT SINGLE. MR OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO -- MISTER CHANG AND I SEVERAL YEARS AGO JOINT AUTHORED A BILL THAT. KIND OF PUT US ON THIS PATH TO WHAT WHAT WITHIN CALLED ZERO BASED BUDGETING WHICH ARE. NOW CALLING MISSION BASED BUDGETING SO I'M VERY EXCITED AND HAPPY TO SEE YOU MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT -- I THINK THAT. WHEN WE DID THAT IT WAS BORN OUT OF FRUSTRATION FOR THE WAY THAT THE CURRENT BUDGETING PROCESS WORKED AND A DESIRE TO SEE IT WORK BETTER IN A WAY THAT HOLISTICALLY LOOKED AT? WHAT EACH DEPARTMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO DO IT? SO WE WERE IN HOPES THAT AS YOU'RE DOING NOW WE START WITH A SMALLER DEPARTMENTS TRANSITIONING OVER TO THE BIGGER DEPARTMENTS CAN YOU TALK ABOUT. THE THE YOU TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS YOU TALK ABOUT LIKE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW. HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN YOUR OPINION -- WHAT YOU THINK THE TIME LINE WOULD BE FOR TRANSITIONING TO LARGER DEPARTMENTS AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK THAT MAYBE THIS WOULD BE ULTIMATELY THE WAY THAT WE DO BUDGETING INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT? METHODOLOGY. SURE -- AND SO FIRST WE DID TRY TO START WITH SMALLER DEPARTMENTS BUT WE DID ALSO TAKE ON THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS WHICH I WOULD SAY IS NOT A SMALL. BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION ONE OF THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED PARTICULARLY IN NOT REVIEW BECAUSE IT WAS SO BIG AND WE KIND OF HAD EVERYTHING ABOUT THEIR OPERATIONS AND PROGRAMS THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT IT'S PROBABLY TO PICK -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS THAT PARTICULAR PROPOSAL SINCE EARLY -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN ADMITTEDLY WITH MY TEAM AS IT'S I THINK THERE'S JUST UNDER FIVE OF US FROM A FULL TIME EQUIVALENT PERSPECTIVE SO. JUST -- THE WORK IS TIME INTENSIVE IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE OVER TIME AND IN THEIR TIME -- AND STATE HOSPITALS IN PARTICULAR WE ARE ABOUT WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER YOU KNOW MATHEMATICALLY HALFWAY THROUGH. AND WE HAVE THREE BIG PROPOSALS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR WHICH ART IS KIND OF THE FIRST BIG PIECES OF WORK TO COME OUT OF THAT. AND WE HAVE SMALLER ONES SO VERY SMALL DEPARTMENT PER -- PERSONAL EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD -- IT WAS DONE IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WHAT WE TOOK ON AND I THINK WHAT YOU'VE CAUTIONED US WHEN WE FIRST MET WAS VERY AMBITIOUS -- WE ALSO HAVE TO KIND OF FIT OUR WORK IN ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENT'S PORTFOLIO BECAUSE WE TRY NOT TO JUST DO IT IN ISOLATION SO WE WORK WITH OUR BUDGET. COUNTERPARTS IN THE RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS UNIT THAT I AM MANAGING AND AND WANT TO BRING THEM ALONG AND BRING THEM UP TO SPEED -- IF NOT HAVE THEM PARTICIPATE ON SOME OF THE A VERY INTENSIVE SITE VISITS WE DO SO FOR INSTANCE IN STATE HOSPITALS WE WENT. TO ALL FIVE HOSPITALS -- SOME OF THEM MORE THAN ONCE WE WENT AND VISITED AID -- JAIL BASED FACILITY THAT DEALING WITH OUR INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL POPULAR SHIN SO WE IT'S A VERY INTENSE FIELD KIND OF FOCUSED -- REVIEW -- SO MY CONCLUSION IS THAT I THINK TAKING OFF MORE BITE SIZE PIECES -- IS PROBABLY EASIER AND MORE DURABLE AND MORE ANALOGOUS TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO PERMEATE A LITTLE BIT MORE THROUGH OUR BUDGET PROCESS WHICH IS THE EARLY ENGAGEMENT SO. I VIEWED THE MISSION BASED REVIEWS KIND OF HELPING TO INFORM THIS EARLY ENGAGEMENT EFFORT WHICH WERE TRYING TO DO MORE AND MORE -- IN THE DEPARTMENT BUT IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO DO THIS ON EVERYTHING THAT WE DO FROM A BUDGET BUILDING PERSPECTIVE -- FIRST NOT EVERYTHING LENDS ITSELF TO THAT SUMMER VERY WORKLOAD WITH JUDY DRIVEN PROPOSALS SO WE PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO INVEST THAT KIND OF TIME AND ENERGY ON WHERE IS OTHERS NEED TO FOCUS LOOKS AND PARTICULAR PROGRAMS OR AREAS BUT IF YOU WANTED TO DO IT. ACROSS THE BOARD IT WOULD IT WOULD -- SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE SIZE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IT WOULD RESULT IN THE OUTCOMES THAT YOU'RE KIND OF WOULD BE LOOKING FOR TO DO THAT SO I THINK CONTINUE TO DO THE TARGETED FOCUSED REVIEWS. PRIORITIZED -- BY EACH OF OUR PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER AREAS -- WHICH LARGELY LINE UP WITH OUR CABINET AREAS AND THE DEPARTMENT. IS IS PROBABLY A REASONABLE APPROACH IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE TIME TO WORK OUR WAY THROUGH. THOSE ISSUES AND AND THEN THERE ARE ALSO OTHER PURCHASE THAT WORK -- SO FOR INSTANCE THE WORK OF OF SAY OUR OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATION ON PARTICULAR AREAS -- OF THE STATE IS IS ALSO ANOTHER APPROACH OR TOOL THAT WE KIND OF HAVE IN OUR FINANCE TOOL BELT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS. SURE THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THAT'S WHERE ABOUT WHERE WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO LAND RIGHT WAS THAT THIS WASN'T GOING TO BE THE ANSWER -- FOR DOING EVERY DEPARTMENT EVERY YEAR BUT PERHAPS THIS WAS GOING TO INFORM OUR OTHER BUDGETING PRACTICES SO ONE OF THE HOPES WHEN WE STARTED WAS THAT THE TRULY LARGE DEPARTMENTS LIKE -- DEPARTED TRANSFER ASIAN FOR EXAMPLE WE KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE -- TO MISSION BASED BUDGET THOSE DEPARTMENTS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR BUT WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BITE SIZED PIECES AND DOING ON A ROLLING BASIS -- IS THAT STILL THE PLAN AND YOU HAVE A A PLAN TO TACKLE THOSE LARGER PROJECTS SO SO CERTAINLY THAT IS THE CONCEPT OF THE IDEA FOR A LARGER DEPARTMENTS -- I DON'T KNOW THAT IF IT'S GOING TO BE SOLELY MISSION BASED REVIEWS BUT A COMBINATION OF OUR MISSION BASED REVIEWS ON THIS EARLY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. THAT WE STARTED LAST YEAR I THINK HELP US BREAK THOSE BIGGER DEPARTMENTS INTO BITE SIZE CHUNKS -- TRANSPORTATION WE HAVE BEEN KIND OF WORKING ON THAT OVER SOME PERIOD OF TIME -- THOUGH I THINK IMPLEMENTATION OF SB ONE KIND OF SHIFTED THE FOCUS AND NOT ORGANIZATION AND THEY CONTINUE TO DO THEIR CAP OUT LEE SUPPORT PROGRAM THROUGH A ZERO BASED PROCESS BASED ON THE REVENUE THAT'S AVAILABLE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. SO I I THINK THAT'S TRUE THAT WE WILL YOU KNOW TRY TO BE LOOKING AT THAT AND WE'LL TAKE. PIECES OF BIG DEPARTMENTS OVER TIME AND ADDRESS THEM EITHER THROUGH THE MISSION BASED REVIEW EARLY ENGAGEMENT WITH HAD A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN OUR ADMINISTRATION OBVIOUSLY -- WITH THE ELECTION AS WELL AS A CHANGE IN OUR ORGANIZATION AND SO OUR PLAN IS TO REGROUP IN THE SUMMER. AND TALK AS A DEPARTMENT WITH OUR LEADERSHIP AND EXECUTIVES IN THE DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT OUR NEXT SET OF PRIORITIES ARE AND OUR CURRENT FOCUS IS REALLY FINISHING WHAT WE STARTED WE HAVE FIVE REVIEWS STILL UNDER WAY. WE'VE BEEN KIND OF BRINGING RESULTS AS WE CAN ON THOSE PROPOSALS I THINK THEY'RE SEVERAL PROPOSALS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT TO WE WRAP THIS UP SO TAKING ON NEW STUFF RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S PROBABLY NOT IN OUR BEST INTEREST. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU TO THE COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SING THEN WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER COOPER WHO WILL BE PRESENTING THIS RUBIO AS BILL AB -- SEVENTEEN FOURTEEN GOOD MORNING THIS CHAIR MEMBERS OBVIOUSLY ON NOT MISS RUBIO BUT HER PLANE WAS DELAYED -- SO SHOULD BE HERE SHORTLY -- BUT MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN FOURTEEN ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO. DURING SOMEONE HEARINGS CYLINDER RUBIO AND MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THEIR ABILITY TO DELIVER IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER. THE COMMISSION ALSO NOTES DH CS THE TOTAL BUDGET PROJECTED BE JUST ABOVE ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY INCLUDING ALL STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS. GIVING D. H. C. S. THE LARGEST PART WILL BUDGET IN THE STATE. IN RECENT YEARS THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF DCS HAS RESULTED IN SIZEABLE BUDGET ERRORS DUE TO POOR INTERNAL PROCEDURES. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE MEDI CAL ESTIMATE WAS FOUND TO BE OFF BY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION THAT'S BILLION WITH A B.. DUE TO MISCALCULATION OF COST IN AN INCORRECT ACCOUNTING FOR RETROACTIVE FEDERAL DRUG REBATE PAYMENTS. THESE TOURS WERE SO LARGE THAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE PROPOSED OFFSETTING CUTS TO WHAT IS THE SPENDING PRIORITIES TO PAY FOR THE LOSS FUNDING. IN ADDITION THIS MASSIVE AIR DH CS HAS CONTINUE MISMANAGED SOME OF THE SMALLER OPERATIONS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS OCCURRED THE DEPARTMENT'S HANDLING OF HIS SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OUR SUBCOMMITTEE AND LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO THE ACS IN ORDER TO OPERATE THESE HOT LINES. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE APPROPRIATE AN ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT THREE MILLION HOWEVER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN DURING A SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING WERE INFORMED THAT DESPITE THE EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION OF FUNDING. DH CS WAS NOT OPERATING A SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE AT ALL. ON TOP OF THAT THE PURPOSE ASKING FOR ANOTHER FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. AFTER A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH IN LETTERS DCS MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT DID YES REGULATIONS. PREVENTING THEM FROM FTA CONTRACT WITH THE VENDOR TO OPERATE THE HOTLINES RESULTING IN A TWO YEAR DELAY. HOWEVER AFTER STAFF CONTACTED TGS WAS BUT TO OUR ATTENTION THAT NO SUCH REGULATIONS EXIST THAT DCS WAS NOT BOUND BY ANY RULES SET FORTH. THE PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE OR THE STRAIGHT STATE ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL. THIS IS EITHER A BLATANT LIE ARE YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF INCOMPETENCE. THIS IS A DMV WERE ERRORS IN THIS MANAGER RESULTS IN INCREASED WAIT TIMES. THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT WERE MISMANAGEMENT THESE PEOPLE'S LIFE AND HEALTH AT STAKE. THEY NEED TO BE A HIGHER STANDARD. FROM THE TOP ON DOWN IS THROUGH THE DH CS NEED THE CULTURE CHANGE AN INCREASED FOCUS PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY SERVICES AND RESULTS TO CALIFORNIANS. AB SEVENTY FOURTEEN WILL BEGIN A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION ON HOW TO BEST IMPROVE JCS INCREASE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TO PRESENT HERE TODAY LOOK FOR PUTTING THE BILL THIS RUBIO DOES. AND FOR THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] OUR FINAL. HI RANDALL OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR ON THE NEED -- TO IMPROVE ESTIMATING -- ON MEDI CAL AT THE DEPARTMENT -- BUT I THINK WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENCE OF OF APPROACH AND AND SO CURRENTLY WE ARE RIGHT IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- WE HAVE TO PROPOSALS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEFORE THE HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES SUBCOMMITTEE THIS YEAR TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS -- THE FIRST -- BEING -- SIGNIFICANT PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO DH CS TO IMPROVE -- FISCAL ESTIMATING AND STRENGTH AND CASH FLOW MONITORING -- AND I'M I'M GLAD THAT THE ARCHIVE THE AUTHOR'S ARGUMENTS -- DRESSED -- THE THE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO DRUG REBATES -- BECAUSE WE HAVE A SECOND PROPOSAL THAT WOULD CREATE A SPECIAL FUND -- THAT WOULD HELP US MANAGE THAT VOLATILITY -- RESULTING FROM DRUG REBATES AND HOPEFULLY BRING -- SOME GREATER DEGREE OF CERTAINTY TO GENERAL FUND SPENDING ON MEDI CAL OVER TIME -- I'M HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE PROPOSALS. DID YOU EVER COMMENT ON THE PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING ASPECT OF IT. I I THINK THAT THE CORE PART OF THAT ARGUMENT IS JUST THAT THE THE PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING OF MY COLLEAGUE -- MENTIONED THE THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND RESOURCES LABOR THAT GOES INTO THAT SORT OF PROCESS. AND OUR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT THAT THE BILL WOULD DISTRACT FROM THESE OTHER EFFORTS THAT WERE WERE BUT I PROPOSING THIS YEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE SAYS IF I GET A RIGHT WE'RE GONNA GIVE THEM MORE MONEY. AND THE ISSUE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE AS I WAS WITH HER PRESENT IT IS JUST OVER CAL OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY TO MEDICARE'S AND WE'RE TALKING -- WAS AT ONE POINT. EIGHT BILLION ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY BILLION ONE PLATE GLASS SNIFFING AMOUNT SO. THAT'S PLAY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND IT'S IT'S LEGISLATURE THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT TO WITH OVERSIGHT SORE GIVE YOU MORE MONEY BUT WHERE IS THE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY. I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S MY QUESTION. I THINK THAT IS SO I THINK WE AGREE THAT THERE IS THIS GROWING COMPLEXITY IN THE PROGRAM THAT THE AMOUNTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVE GROWN OVER TIME -- I'M NOT REALLY SURE EXACTLY HOW PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING IS AIMED TO ADDRESS THOSE THOSE TYPES OF PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE THE THE THE ESTIMATING -- VARIATIONS HAVE REALLY COME FROM -- THE THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ON A CASH BASIS -- THE TIMING OF VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT TRANSACTIONS CAN CAN HAVE A HUGE EFFECT ON WHAT SPENDING IS FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND I THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST -- AND WHILE I ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE AUTHOR'S ARGUMENT ABOUT GIVING THEM MORE RESOURCES KIND OF AN INCENTIVE -- PROBLEM I SUPPOSE -- THE THE CHALLENGES HERE REALLY RELATE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS AND AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT BETTER COORDINATE. BETWEEN UNITS AND AND AND ESSENTIALLY TRACK THESE THESE TRANSACTIONS BETTER I THINK THAT WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THOSE -- THOSE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS ARE ARE WHAT'S GOING TO IMPROVE THE ESTIMATE OVER TIME. QUESTION FROM THE SHELTON SO ON DO YOU ANTICIPATE -- THIS DEPARTMENT BEING ON THE LIST ANY TIME SOON. I GUESS THAT THE THE BROADER QUESTION IS IS. THE ULTIMATE MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT IS TO INCREASE HEALTH CARE ACCESS FOR FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND AT TIMES -- THE COMMITTEE THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS FELT THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S BEEN. SOMEWHAT COMBATIVE FOR SOMEONE -- THEY HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A DRACONIAN APPROACH SO THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO INCREASE ACCESS BUT ALMOST. THERE THERE ARE THINGS THAT SOMETIMES PENALIZED -- THIS IS A CALIFORNIA FROM BEING TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE SO THAT DOES SEEM TO BE SORT OF A IN CONFLICT WITH THEIR MISSION. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THOSE ARE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT THINGS TO BE CONSIDERING AND EVALUATING IN THE PROGRAM THAT SAID THE REVIEW THAT MY COLLEAGUE SPOKE OF WAS SOMETHING THAT I INITIATED WHEN I WAS MANAGING THAT PARTICULAR AREA -- BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN WITH THEIR ESTIMATE PROCESS AND THERE ARE EIGHT UNIT THAT HAVE TOUCH POINTS IN MOUNT PROCESS MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET A HANDLE ON AND I THINK THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME. WE HAVE TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT AND I THINK SHORING UP SOME OF THESE PROCESS SEES HAVING BETTER REPORTING ACCOUNTABILITY PREDICTABILITY MONTHLY RECONCILIATIONS ALL OF THE THINGS. THAT ARE PART OF THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEING HAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS TO HELPING NOT ORGANIZATION AND I THINK THEN WHEN YOU GET THAT PICTURE. THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP BETTER INFORM SOME OF THOSE PROGRAM DELIVERY COMPONENTS THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AND CERTAINLY WE WILL AND TAKE YOUR INTEREST IN PRIORITY BACK TO OUR PPM GROUP ARE PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER GROUP. AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR PRIORITIES OVER THE SUMMER WITH THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE WHICH TALK ABOUT DELIVERY STANDARDS AND HERE'S TO SUBVENTIONS A BIG THING WILL BE TO OUR OUR LGBT. LGBT Q. YOUTH ARE ARE VETERANS AT BIG ISSUE A SUICIDE PREVENTION AND THEY'RE FUNDED FROM A POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS. THEY NEVER STAND UP THEIR SUICIDE HOTLINE NEVER STOOD UP. MAY HAVE THE GALL TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL. FOUR POINT THREE MILLION MORE ON TOP OF THAT IT IS SOME POINT. AND THAT'S THAT'S ACTUAL RELEASE REAL STUFF THAT'S REAL DEAL PEOPLE TO KILL THEMSELVES AND I'M SURE. IF THIS IS BEEN IN PLACE WE MAY PREVENTED SOME OF TAKING THEIR OWN LIFE. SO IT AT SOME POINT THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE. AND THAT THIS IS REAL THIS PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE NOT SOME BUDGET NOT SOME NUMBER PERFORMANCE BASED DANDER IT'S THEY'VE IT THEY HAVE FALLEN DOWN THE JOB. AND FOR US TO Q. FIFTEEN TO FUND THEM IN. THE STATUS QUO IS UNACCEPTABLE. PEOPLE EITHER DEALING WITH. THANK YOU DOCTOR. YES -- I I APPRECIATE. THE PRESENTATION IN THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE BRINGING FORTH WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. WHAT I THINK WHAT I'M TRIP WRESTLING WITH AN AYE MAYBE THOUGH THE START TO IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE REQUESTING? AND THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THESE ARE -- THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP. OVERSIGHT I'M NOT SURE IF IF WE DOING THAT THE THE BUDGET PIECE IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE BUDGET THAT WILL ACTUALLY GET TO THE PROBLEM WE HAVE WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOME. SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN LEADERSHIP WITH REGARDS TO PEOPLE TAKING A CHARGE IN MAKING SURE THE PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENTED AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND I COULD SEE OUT. IF WE DO THE BUDGETING I I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE CONNECTION IS BETWEEN THIS REQUEST AND THAT AND OF AND PROBABLY CAME OUT OF SHEER FRUSTRATION. OF SAYING YOU KNOW WE WANT TO HOLD ON THE MONEY AND AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT SPENDING MONEY THAT THAT THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE WHATEVER IT MAY BE. BUT IT SEEMS THAT THAT'S ONE THING THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING PROCESS WHICH IS SOMEWHAT LITTLE BIT. QUITE DIFFERENT THAN BASICALLY TALKING ABOUT OVERSIGHT MANAGEMENT LEADERSHIP AND ACCOUNTABILITY I MEAN. THEY HAVE SOME CONNECTION BUT I COULD SEE IS ENGAGING IN THIS PROCESS WITH THE OF THE BUDGETING PROCESS AND GETTING THAT PART. DOWN AND THEN STILL HAVING THIS OVER HERE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE WHO ARE BASICALLY IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE ASKED TO AND BEING ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE. THINGS AND COMING BACK AND REPORTING TO US WHEN THINGS ARE NOT THERE OR NOT SHOULD BE THERE SO. IF YOU KNOW YOU COULD YOU CONNECT THE DOTS OR BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU JUST SAY IT WELL WITH GOD'S WHETHER WE DO THIS THIS AND THIS WE NEED TO DO THIS WHICH IS TRUE BUT SO SOME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHETHER NOT IF WE IF WE ENGAGE IN THIS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A SYSTEMATIC PROCESS OF DOING THIS WITH AN AD THAT WOULD GET US. TO THE SOLUTION TO THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM QUICKLY. SURE I WAS AT THE EDGE THAT QUESTION THE AUTHORS NOT HERE SHE'S ON A PLANE RIGHT NOW -- SO I'M I'M SITTING TO ME LET ME TAKE A CRACK AT A SO SO DOCTOR BY THINKING YOU YOU BROUGHT UP A POINT THAT MR GALLAGHER BROUGHT UP THAT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT. SO. WE DO HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION FOR THE BILL TODAY TO MOVING ON COMMITTEE. BUT THE AUTHOR HAS COMMITTED TO TO WORK WITH US BUT ALSO TO WORK WITH FINANCE SO WE CAN REALLY ALIGNED ALONG THIS PROCESS RIGHT SO I THINK. THE AUTHOR HAD ORIGINALLY. CHOSEN TO USE THE PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING A PROPOSAL BUT WE ALSO THE COMMITTEE LET HER KNOW ABOUT THIS MISSION MISSION BASED BUDGETING PROPOSAL THAT'S READY IN THE WORKS I KNOW IT'S NOT. THAT WELL KNOWN THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE WE CONSISTENTLY MYSELF MISTRAL MULTI. THIS MCCARTY BECAUSE AS WE GET QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS FROM OF MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUE SO. I THINK BASED ON THAT INFORMATION SHE WANTED. TO STEP MEETING WITH PUBLIC FINANCE TRY TO WORK OUT A PATH BEFORE WE ARE WE ARE SUPPORT ABOUT THE BILL MOVING FORWARD. TODAY EVEN IN ITS CURRENT FORM BECAUSE WE DO THINK IT HELPS CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION ON A DEPARTMENT THAT AT TIMES HASN'T BEEN THE MOST RESPONSIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE. I'M THINKING WE HOPE THAT BY WORKING WITH PUBLIC FINANCE WE CAN. FIND A SOLUTION THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON ALL OF US AND AND REALLY MADE A MOVE THIS AGENCY FOR IT SO CAN REALLY SERVE. ITS MISSION ABOUT PROVIDING GREATER HEALTH CARE ACCESS FOR ALL OF US MR WORLD. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO -- I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS EFFORT TO INCREASE OUR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE APARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES I pLONGER TEN YEAR FOR THE AVERAGE LEGISLATOR. I'M HOPEFUL THAT. WE WILL EXERCISE THAT OVERSIGHT ROLE MORE OFTEN AND I THINK THIS IS -- THAT THE THE FAILURES THAT YOU'VE RAISED -- IS AN EXCELLENT CATALYST FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT -- I DO SHARE THE CHAIRS CONCERNS ABOUT THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THIS BILL GOES ABOUT THAT OVERSIGHT YOU HEARD THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TESTIFIED THAT. WE TRY PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING WE CONSIDER THAT A FAILURE WHEN WE TRY TO THREE YEARS AGO -- I'M NOT SURE WHY IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO BRING THAT BACK ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'VE GOT TO OTHER FORMS OF BUDGETING THAT WERE ALREADY WORKING ON IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE AUTHOR IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO AMEND THE BILL TO PERHAPS -- FITTED INTO THE CURRENT MISSION BASED BUDGETING FRAMEWORK AND WITH THAT COMMITMENT IN PLACE I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT IT SHOULD THE BILL COME TO THE FLOOR IN ITS CURRENT FORM -- I WILL RE EVALUATE THAT SUPPORTED I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE DO THE SAME.
