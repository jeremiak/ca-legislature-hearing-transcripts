MOMENT GOING TO TURN OVER TO DEBBIE THOMPSON OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR ADULT PROGRAMS. GOOD AFTERNOON DEBBIE THOMPSON THAT. DEPUTY DIRECTOR IT'LL PROGRAM CDSS AND YOU WERE HANDED OUT UP POWER POINT. THAT. TALKS ABOUT AN OVERVIEW OF THE SSI ASSIST PEAPACK PROGRAM. AND I'M JUST GOING TO QUICKLY GO THROUGH IT AND POINT OUT WHAT IT CONTAINS. AND SPEND HAPPY TO EXPAND OR ANSWER QUESTIONS ON ANY OF IT FOR YOU. THE FIRST. SLIDE JUST SHARES THROUGH THE PROGRAM SERVES DIFFERENT INFORMATION. THE SECOND SLIDE. PROVIDE SOME DATA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE POPULATION RECEIVING SSI ASSIST P. BOTH ON A STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL SO THAT YOU CAN SEE IT IS. COMING DOWN SLIGHTLY BOTH STATE AND NATIONALLY. THE NEXT SLIDE KIND OF GOES INTO SOME REASONS THAT ARE THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE POTENTIAL FOR WHY IT MAY BE DECLINING SOMEONE. IT SEEMS TO BE PRIMARILY THE DISABLED POPULATION. THAT SEEMS TO BE DECLINING. THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE FIVE. PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE BUDGET WHICH HAS STAYED FAIRLY FLAT THIS YEAR AND INTO NEXT. RIGHT ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS WITH ABOUT TWO POINT EIGHT OF NOT BEING. ASSIST P. PORTION WHICH THE STATE FUNDS. NEXT SLIDE COVERS THE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT REQUIREMENT AS FAR AS WHAT'S THE STATE IS OBLIGATED TO PARTICIPATE IN. AND THEN YOU GO INTO ON SLIDE SEVEN THE DIFFERENT PAYMENT STANDARDS. SO THIS YEAR THE INDIVIDUAL MOST COMMON PAYMENT STANDARD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL IS NINE HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS AND FOR THE COUPLE. IT'S FIFTEEN THIRTY TWO THOSE ARE ANTICIPATED TO GO UP DUE TO THE COLA. JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO APPROX WE NINE THIRTY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IN FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO FOR THE COUPLE. THE FOLLOWING SLIDE ON SLIDE EIGHT PROVIDES. INFORMATION ABOUT THE SS I SS P. LEVELS IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES. CURRENTLY. THE INDIVIDUALS AT ABOUT EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IN THE COUPLE'SAT ABOUT A HUNDRED ALMOST A HUNDRED AND TWELVE. SOME OF VERY SIMILAR FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ABOUT NINETY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND HUNDRED AND TWELVE AGAIN FOR A COUPLE PERCENT. THE FOLLOWING. SLIDES PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE COLA HISTORIES. FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND THEN THE COUPLES. AND THEN THE LAST SLIDE PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT. THE RELATIONSHIP OF SS P. AND. CAO FRESH AND THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY IN A CASH OUT MODEL. GREAT NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SCOTT GRAPES. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SCOTT GRAVES ON THE RESEARCH DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER. HOW MY ROLE TODAY OVER THE NEXT FEW MINUTES IS TO SHOW HOW BASIC MONTHLY INCOME SUPPORT PROVIDED THROUGH AS A SCIENCE IS P. FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES? I'M STACKS UP TO DIFFERENT MEASURES OF COST OF LIVING AND MATERIAL WELL BEING HOW I'M GONNA DO THAT THROUGH BY WALKING YOU THROUGH ABOUT SEVENTH CHARTS. ON BUT BEFORE I GET INTO THE DETAILS ABOUT THE GRANTS THEMSELVES ARE AND HOW THEY MEASURE UP I FIRST WANT TO STEP BACK AND LAY OUT. ON FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE STEEP DECLINE IN STATE SUPPORT FOR SS I SS P. THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST DECADE SO YOU SHOULD HAVE. ON THE HANDOUT IF YOU DO I WOULD ASK YOU TO TO MOVE TO THE FIRST CHART WHICH IS ON PAGE TWO. CLEARLY YOU CAN SEE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT ABOUT A DECADE AGO ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION THE STATE WAS SPENDING THROUGH RIGHT GENERAL FUND JUST YEAR ON ITS SHARE OF SS P.. ON GRANTS AS PART OF THE SS I SS P. PROGRAM ON BECAUSE OF SEVERE CUTS THAT WERE MADE IN RESPONSE TO THE GREAT RECESSION IN THE BUDGET SHORTFALLS THAT THE STATE EXPERIENCED. AREN'T WE SOUGHT SPENDING ON S. S. P. ON THE US HAS PEOPLE RUSSIAN OF THE GRANTS DROP PRETTY DRAMATICALLY OVER THERE THE COMING YEARS I'M TO THE POINT WHERE. THE STATE TODAY IS SPENDING JUST OVER AROUND TWO POINT SIX BILLION. ON SS THE SS P. PORTION OF THE GRANT SO WHAT IS THAT MEAN THAT MEANS THAT OVER THE LAST DECADE STATE SPENDING ON THESE GRANTS HAS COME DOWN BY ABOUT. FORTY PERCENT. RELATIVE TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT LEVEL ON A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THAT IS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR CALIFORNIA SPENDING WELL OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS LAST. FROM THE GENERAL FUND ON SS I SS P. I'M AS A RESULT OF THE ONGOING CUTS THAT HAVE CONTINUED ON IN THE PROGRAM. SO HOW DID THE STATE ACHIEVED THESE LARGE ONGOING GENERAL FUND SAVINGS WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHART ON PAGE THREE. IT PROVIDES THE ANSWER. THAT SORT OF AT THE FOR THE AND I APOLOGIZE TO THE AUDIENCE WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE CHART BUT. AT THE BOTTOM OF EACH BAR YOU CAN SEE SORT OF A GOLD SHADING THAT REPRESENTS THE STATE'S S. S. P. PORTION OF THE GRANT. BACK IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND NINE CALIFORNIA WAS PROVIDING A MAXIMUM GRANT ON THE ON THE S. S. P. SIDE OF OF OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE DOLLARS PER MONTH. FOR MOST SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. ON THAT VERY QUICKLY CAME DOWN TO AROUND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX PER MONTH WHICH WAS THE MINIMUM ALLOWED BY FEDERAL LAW FOR INDIVIDUAL GRANTS. ARM AND OVER THE COMING YEARS THE STATE HAS PROVIDED JUST A SINGLE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT THAT TOOK EFFECT IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND WHICH BROUGHT. UP THE GRANT LEVEL FROM A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX DOLLARS UP TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE DOLLARS SO RELATIVELY ON MODEST INCREASE TO GRANT LEVELS. SO THE REDLINE ABOVE THE BARS IS THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES FOR EACH YEAR THAT SIMPLY INDICATES THAT WHILE WE WERE FUNDING ON SS I SS P. GRANTS. ARM SO THAT THEY REACH THE POVERTY LINE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. ARE THESE GRANTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING FUNDED AT A LEVEL THAT LEAVES THEM AT NINETY PERCENT OF THE POVERTY LINE SO BASICALLY ANYBODY ON SS I SS P. EVEN IF THEY RECEIVE THE MAXIMUM GRANT ALLOWABLE. I'M AS AN INDIVIDUAL THEIR LEFT IT NINETY PERCENT OF THE POVERTY LINE ALWAYS IMPORTANT POINT OUT THAT AS MANY OF YOU ALREADY KNOW OUR AYE I BELIEVE ALL OF YOUKNOW. THAT AS A SCIENTIST HE RECIPIENTS IN CALIFORNIA DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CAL FRESH FOOD ASSISTANCE SO THE MINIMAL BASIC SUPPORT THEY RECEIVE EACH MONTH NOT ONLY HAVE TO HELP THEM KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. BUT ALSO PURCHASE GROCERIES MEDICINE AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES. SO IF WE MOVE ON TO SLIDE FOR I'M SOME ADVOCATES HAVE SUGGESTED. A REASONABLE GOAL TO SET WOULD BE TO RAISE EXERCISES P. GRANTS BACK UP TO THE POVERTY LINE ON THE FEDERAL FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES. I'M WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE IN SHORT FORM THIS IS SIMPLY TO BARS ON PAGE FOUR ONE SHOWS YOU WHERE WE ARE NOW RELATIVE TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. THAT THE BAR ON THE RIGHT SHOWS YOU WHERE WE WOULD HAVE TO GO IN ORDER TO GET GRANTS UP TO THE POVERTY GUIDELINES ESSENTIALLY WE HAVE DUG SUCH A DEEP HOLE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO RAISE OUR STATE S. S. P. PORTION OF THE GRANT BY JUST OVER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. UP FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL IN THE PROGRAM WHO RECEIVED AN INDIVIDUAL GRANT ON IN ORDER TO BRING THEM UP JUST TO THE POVERTY LINE. AND AND YOU KNOW THAT'S A RELATIVELY MODEST GOAL TO HAVE TO TO BRING SOMEBODY UP TO THE POVERTY LINE WERE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT PUSHING THEM WELL I'M OUT OF POVERTY SO. THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS WHO HAVE HAD SUGGESTED THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE I'M A AND IT WOULD BE A RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE ENDEAVOR WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THE STATE TO DO THAT IN A SINGLE FISCAL YEAR. BUT IT COULD BE A GOAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO SET THAT IT WANTS TO ACHIEVE OVER TIME. SO THE LAST UP YOU SLICE HERE MY PRESENTATION I'M I JUST WANTED TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW S. P. S. ISAPI GRANTS MATCH UP NOT JUST TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES. BUT TO OTHER MEASURES OF COST OF LIVING AND MATERIAL WELL BEING IN CALIFORNIA SO SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN A FACT SHEET THAT THE BUDGET CENTER RELEASED LAST MONTH. IN WHICH WE SHOWED UP THE AND WE COMPARED THE MAXIMUM SS I SS BE GRANTED EVERY COUNTY. TO THE FAIR MARKET RENT FOR A STUDIO APARTMENT IN EACH COUNTY THE FAIR MARKET RENT OR FM ARE. IS SET BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EACH YEAR FOR HOUSING ASSISTANCE PURPOSES IT'S A RELATIVELY MODEST UNIT YOU'D BE LOOKING AT. WHAT ARE FACT SHEET SHOWED WAS THAT I'M IN SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES UP THE STUDIO F. M. R. I'M EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM SSI ASSIST P. GRANT? AND IN ALL COUNTIES THE FM ARE FOR A STUDIO APARTMENT EXCEEDS HALF OF THE GRANT THE REASON WE PICK HALF THE GRANT IS BECAUSE THAT'S SORT OF AN INDICATOR. IF SOMEONE IS SPENDING HALF OR MORE OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS SO THIS CHART SIMPLY PICKS OUT FOR YOU ELEVEN OF THE COUNTIES THAT WE FEATURED IN THAT FACT SHEET. OUT WHICH NOT SURPRISINGLY ARE REPRESENTED BY THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF AND PERHAPS WHERE YOUR. THE COUNTIES YOU REPRESENT FALL ON THE SCALE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW AN FM ARE FOR A STUDIO APARTMENT WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT A ONE OR TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN APARTMENT WITHOUT A BEDROOM. IN ALL CASES I'M EXCEED WHAT SOMEBODY LIVING ON THIS INCOME SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO PAY. THE LAST THREE SLIDES IN THE PRESENTATION HERE I'M MAYBE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED TO LOOK AT BUT WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS TO COMPARE THE MAXIMUM SSI SAYS P. GRANT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. TO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF. POVERTY THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT POVERTY THRESHOLDS WE USE IN THE U. S. ONE IS THE OFFICIAL POVERTY THRESHOLD THAT MANY OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH. ON THE OTHER IS CALLED THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY THRESHOLD THAT'S BEEN PUBLISHED IN RECENT YEARS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND TRIES TO DO A BETTER JOB OF CAPTURING. Y. TO FAMILY OR INDIVIDUAL MIGHT NEED IN ORDER TO OUR STATE SOMEWHAT MAKE ENDS MEET IN THIS STATE OR IN THIS COUNTRY. ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT. A BUDGET IS TO THINK ABOUT I'M NOT JUST WHEN IS SOMEONE OUT OF POVERTY BUT WHAT LEVEL OF INCOME DO THEY REALLY NEED AN ORDER ON TO HAVE A DECENT STANDARD OF LIVING. OF THE UC I CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS PUBLISHES WHAT THEY CALL THE ELDER INDEX AND ESTIMATES WHAT IT COSTS ON FOR AN INDIVIDUAL A SENIOR OR A YET SENIORS LIVING IN ANY CALIFORNIA COUNTY WHAT IT WOULD COST FOR THEM TO SORT OF MAKE ENDS. MEET IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET SO I'VE DONE ON THE NEXT THREE SLIDES FOR THE FRESNO AREA OF THE SANTA ROSA AND CINEMA COUNTY AREA AND THE LOS ANGELES AREA INCLUDING THE INCLUDING THE THE METROPOLITAN AREA. THAT WOULD INCLUDE ANAHEIM AS WELL IS TO SORT OF LAY OUT WHERE THE MAXIMUM SS I SS P. GRANT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AGAIN THAT'S AROUND AND NOT NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN DOLLARS RIGHT NOW. HOW THAT STACKS UP TO THE OFFICIAL POVERTY THRESHOLD THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY THRESHOLD AND THE BASIC BUDGET OF THAT THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH ESTIMATES WOULD BE NEEDED IN ORDER FOR? A SENIOR TO MAKE ENDS MEET IN ANY PARTICULAR COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. AND REALLY THE KEY TAKEAWAY HERE I DON'T HAVE TO WALK THROUGH EVERY SLIDE BECAUSE THEY ALL TELL A SIMILAR STORY THE KEY TAKE AWAY IS THAT THE MAXIMUM SSI S. P. GRANT. IS INSUFFICIENT IN EVERY CASE IT FALLS BELOW THE OFFICIAL POVERTY THRESHOLD IF FALLS BELOW THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY THRESHOLD AND IT'S WELL BELOW. WHAT YOU SEE OUT UCLA'S ELDER INDEX ESTIMATES IS NEEDED ARM IN ORDER FOR SENIORS TO MAKE ENDS MEET IN CALIFORNIA? SO WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE'LL HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA AND IF YOU CAN JUST TELL US WHEN YOU WELL PRESENT ON ISSUE TWELVE AS WELL. YOU MAY PRESENT BOTH RIGHT NOW THAT'S GETTING IT FOR YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHERYL IT'LL ALLOW YOU TO HEAR FROM YOU ONLY ONCE TODAY. I KNOW MISTER HARPER'S PLACE AND ABOUT THAT. AND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. YEAH. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE ALL OF YOU TODAY I'M HERE ON BEHALF. OF MANY ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS AS CHAIR OF THE AGING AND LONG TERM. CARE COMMITTEE OF IN MAKING TWO REQUESTS. NUMBER ONE TO RESTORE THE STATE'S SHARE THE SOCIAL SECURITY INCOME AND STATE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT GRANT TO THAT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL OF THIS BEFORE FROM OTHER PRESENTERS. AND A NUMBER TWO WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE I BELIEVE TO PROVIDE A MODEST ALLOCATION. FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS FOR THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM FOR ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. OF WITH THE CHAIRS COMMISSION OUGHT TO FIRST BEGIN WITH SS I SS P. REQUEST. I WANT TO THINK OF AS A MEMBER RUBIO AND EIGHT OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE JOINED ME IN THIS REQUEST. OTHER QUESTIONS BY NO MEANS A PANACEA AS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PRESENTATION. IT WILL NOT SOLVE THE CRISIS FACING OUR AGING AND DISABLED POPULATIONS BUT IT WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT HELP FOR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR MANY OF THE ONE POINT THREE MILLION LOW INCOME SENIORS AND PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES WHO RECEIVE SSI S. B. GRANTS IT IS THEIR SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME. IT HELPS TO PAY RENT BUY FOOD PAPER UTILITIES MEDICINE AND OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES. AND TWO THOUSAND NINE RESPONSE A DEEP BUDGET SHORTFALLS BECAUSE WITH THE GREAT RECESSION THEY CUT THE SSB PORTION THE GRAMMAR BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND COUPLES TO THE LOWEST LEVELS ALLOWED BY FEDERAL LAW. FOR ACCESSBECAUSE FOR TAKING A TWO THOUSAND NINE THE MAXIMUM GRANT WAS A HUNDRED POINT SIX PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TODAY. IT IS EIGHTY NINE POINT ONE PERCENT. AS A RESULT THE MAXIM COMBINED SS I SS BE GRANT FOR INDIVIDUAL. CURRENTLY ABOUT NINE OR ELEVEN DOLLARS PER MONTH AS HE COULD JUST NINETY PERCENT. OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE OF COURSE WHEN COMPOUNDED WITH THE GROWING COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA RECIPIENTS ARE FALLING FAR BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. AND FACING SERIOUS AND LIFE CHANGING DECISIONS ON HOW TO PAY FOR DAILY LIVING EXPENSES. RENT FOOD MEDICATION ELECTRICITY EXETER. ALL THE STATE SAVE AN ESTIMATED TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THESE CUTS THAT BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. WE HAVE RESTORED IN NEARLY EVERY MAJOR PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET. EXCEPT S. S. P. GRANTS AND IF APPROVED WILL FULLY FUND THE STATE'S RAINY DAY CASH RESERVE. FUND TO THIRTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS LARGEST CASH RESERVE IN STATE HISTORY. WHILE WE EMBRACE THE PROJECTED BUDGET SURPLUS AND THE WISDOM OF THE CASH RESERVES. WE CANNOT FORGET THAT THESE WERE ATTAINED IN PART DUE THE CUSTOMER MADE IN THE SACRIFICES MADE BY MANY SITTING BEHIND ME. DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. ALSO THIS IS NOT JUST A RESTORATION BUT RATHER A STEP TOWARDS CONTINUING OUR OBLIGATION TO HELP OF TO OUR SOCIAL CONTRACT. WITH OUR SOCIETY WITH OUR COMMUNITY. WHEN HE SERVED PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE I WORKED ASSURE THAT ALL PEOPLE CAN LIVE THEIR LIFE WITH DIGNITY. IT IS TIME TO RESTORE SSI SSB. INSIDE MY PURSE ACROSS I PRESS YOU TAKE THE TIME. I HAD TO LISTEN TO OUR TO THE REQUEST. ITEM TWO THAT I'M SPEAKING TO WHICH I BELIEVE IS ISSUE TWELVE BEFORE YOU IS REGARDING THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM. I PLEASE TO HAVE THIRTEEN OF MY COLLEAGUES INCLUDING ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO ADJOINING AND THIS REQUEST. THIS REQUEST TO PROVIDE A ONE TIME FIFTEEN MILLION GENERAL. FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. FOR A THREE YEAR DEMONSTRATION GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AMONG VICTIMS OF ELDER ABUSE AND NEGLECT. THE INTENT WOULD BE IF THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES TO ISSUE DEPICTING MILLION DOLLARS. AS A GRANT PROGRAM TO COUNTY ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES AGENCY. I AGENCIES TO HELP APS CLIENTS MAINTAIN THEIR HOUSING TO SERVICES SUCH AS SHORT TERM RENTAL UTILITY ASSISTANCE. LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND EXPANDED CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY THE GRANT PROGRAM WOULD OPERATE AS A DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. ONE THAT WOULD BE USES A MODEL TO REPLICATE IN OTHER COUNTIES. IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY A BY WAY OF EXAMPLE. REPORTS OF ELDER AND DEPENDENT ABUSE NEGLECT OF GROW BY NEARLY THIRTY PERCENT. IT'S TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE GROWTH MIRRORS. AMID GROWING REPORTS OF ELDER ABUSE NEGLECT ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND AS ONE THOUSAND BY STATES ADULTS TURN SIXTY FIVE EVERY DAY. THIS GROWTH IS EXACERBATED I CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS LEADING ABUSED AND NEGLECTED OLDER ADULTS AND EXCRETE THE STREAM RISK. OF BECOMING HOMELESS. IMPACT A P. S. RECEIVES ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PORTS ELDER ABUSE AND NEGLECT EVERY YEAR. OF THOSE CASES COUNTIES ESTIMATED AVERAGE OF TEN PERCENT OR MORE AT OR AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES. ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS PROGRAMS ARE DOING YEOMAN'S WORK WITH MEAGER RESOURCES. BUT THE INCREASING GROWTH OF THE STATE'S SENIOR POPULATION THERE STRUGGLING TO PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE NECESSARY TO HELP VICTIMS OF ABUSE REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES AS THEY RECOVER. RATHER THAN REQUESTING AN ONGOING ALLOCATION WE HOPE COMMITTEES. TO MAP PRIORITIZE A ONE TIME MONEY. SO THEY COUNTY APS BROKERS CAN DEMONSTRATE HOW INTERVENING AT MOMENTS OF CRISIS CAN PREVENT VICTIMS OUTER AND DEPENDENT ABUSE AND NEGLECT FROM BECOMING HOMELESS SO I I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. FOR UP TO LISTEN TO THAT REQUEST AS WELL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. WITH THAT WE WILL NOW HAVE ANDREAS ANDREW CHAIN FROM CALIFORNIANS FOR SSI AS WELL AS LOUISE HERNANDEZ FROM FRESNO METRO MINISTRY. IF WE CAN CREATE A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE FOR THE TWO OF THEM. WHILE THEY'RE COMING UP WE'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH QUORUM. DOCTOR ARAMBULA. HERE HARPER. MATHIS HERE RUBIO. WOULD. QUORUM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MERCY INTERCHANGE FROM CALIFORNIANS FOR SSI. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MORE THAN TO AN ORGANIZATION STATEWIDE AND IF I KNEW HOW TO DO MY JOB I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE STE. FOLKS ALREADY BUT. THAT'S PROVIDED FOR YOUR. FOR YOUR REFERENCE ON THIS REQUESTED ALSO LIST THE GROUPS STATEWIDE. YOU KNOW IT ON THE ABILITY TO BREAK IT DOWN AS I THINK I JUST WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE FROM EVERY CORNER OF THIS STATE TO CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATIONS ARGUMENTS I WILL BE BRIEF AND JUST TALK ABOUT THE HIDDEN COSTS WHICH YOU'RE BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. ON ON THE PUBLIC SECTOR SIDE YOU KNOW WE FEEL JUST AS STRONGLY THAT THE STATE SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO BOOK SAVINGS AND AND BUILD A RESERVE AT THE EXPENSE. OF. RESIDENTS WHO ARE FORCED INTO POVERTY BY STATE ACTION. BUT ALSO THAT THERE ARE ACTUAL COSTS AND THAT ARE ALWAYS BUY INTO THAT THE PERSPECTIVE. SO DOCTOR SELIGMAN AT UCSF FOR EXAMPLE HAS SHOWN THAT HOSPITALIZATIONS SPIKE IN THE FOURTH WEEK OF THE MONTH FOR LOW INCOME POPULATIONS. AFTER FOOD BUDGETS RUN OUT FOLKS CAN'T TAKE THEIR MEDICINE I MEAN THERE THAT WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE ALREADY SKIPPING MEALS YOU KNOW AND AND MAYBE TAKE THEIR MEDS AND THEY SHOULDN'T BUT WHEN THOSE TYPES OF. THINGS BREAKDOWN BECAUSE FOLKS SENSIBLY HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY END UP IN THE HOSPITAL AND THAT'S PUTTING PRESSURE ON OUR HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION AND WE CAN TRY TO MY DOCUMENTATION TO YOU. AND AND FURTHERMORE IT AS BEEN SPOKEN TO ALREADY THERE ARE PUBLIC SAFETY AND HOMELESS INTERVENTION COSTS BECAUSE WHAT FOCUSED SO WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO LIVE IN AND OF LIVING IN THEIR CARS ON THE STREETS AND OTHER ACTS OF DESPERATION. THAT CAN BE PREVENTED IN PART OF RESTORING THE GRANTS WE URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THOSE THOSE THOSE COSTS. BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE INVESTMENTS IN THE IN THE PROGRAM AND ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS WELL FROM THE STATE COULD MAKE ASSOCIATION WE KNOW. THAT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN OUR SERVICE. ONE I CAN SPEAK TO PARTICULARLY IN ALAMEDA COUNTY THEY'VE DOUBLED THE SERVICE TO SENIOR SINCE TWENTY TEN APPROXIMATELY YOU WENT IN ONE CUTS AND A FACT. AND WE DON'T IMPRESS UPON YOU IS THAT IT'S A PERMANENT LEVEL OF SERVICE FEEDBACK FROM BUILT TO PERMANENTLY SUPPORT OF THAT FOOD AND NUTRITION NEEDS A SPECIAL POPULATION IS LARGE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. RIGHT WERE MEANT FOR TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE THIS BOOK TO BETWEEN JOBS OR YOU KNOW GETTING ON TO SOME OF THE PROGRAMS LIKE LIKE HEALTH FRESH THAT'S NOT ALLOWABLE UNDER THE CURRENT RULES ARE GOING TALK ABOUT A SECOND. AND SO JUST THINK ABOUT THE HIDDEN BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO PUSHED ON TO OUR SECTOR THAT'S WHY STORE GROUPS COME FORWARD WITH ASKS BECAUSE WERE SIMPLY BOOKING US COST SOMEWHERE ELSE AND SO THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. I'VE MY NAME'S LOUIS STRANDED SO WITH PRESIDENT METRO MINISTRY ALSO CO CHAIR OF CHOCO THE CALIFORNIA ACTION COALITION. I JUST LIKE. TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE FEW RATHER FEW FRESNO RESIDENTS SPECIFICALLY. BUT DOES VERY MARTINEZ SHE'S A HOMELESS ADVOCATE. WHO?

SHE IS MY NEIGHBOR AND SHE IS ALWAYS A CONSIDERING HER NEIGHBORS WHEN TRYING TO GIVE A HELPING HAND. ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ON SSI IN IN THE FACE OF SUCH ADVERSITY THEY ALWAYS TRY TO PULL AS MANY RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THEY SPREAD MUCH NEEDED HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS AND FRESNO. I CAN IMAGINE MY COMMUNITY WITHOUT THEM AND I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WEARING BETWEEN HOUSING. PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION. OR FOOD. ARE THESE PEOPLE DESERVES IN THE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO BE OUT A HUNDRED PERCENT OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALONG WITH OVER FORTY THREE THOUSAND RESIDENTS.

THE OTHER PERSON WHO I REPRESENT IS MY MOTHER WHO PASSED AWAY. MY MOTHER WAS A LAWYER. SHE WAS THE THIRD AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN TO GRADUATE FROM YALE LAW SCHOOL AND SHE SPENT HER LIFE. STANDING IN PLACES LIKE THIS REPRESENTING THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD NOT REPRESENT THEMSELVES. FOR THIS SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. I TRULY WISH TO TOUCH OUR HEARTS. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I TRULY HOPE. THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CONCERNS ME IS THAT WHEN I LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT STAND HERE. IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THEY'RE BEGGING. AS IF THEY'RE DOWN ON THEIR KNEES. CLEARLY. PLEASE GIVE US FOOD SO THAT WE CAN LIVE. IS AND WHAT. THESE PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING. BECAUSE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND.

AYE ASK YOU TO LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE AND REALIZE THEY REPRESENT. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WHO OR HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS IS NOT A FRIVOLOUS COSTS IF THEY'RE ASKING FOR?

BUT ANOTHER ASPECT TO LOOK AT WIN WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOOD WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MEDICATION WE KNOW HISTORICALLY THE FOURTH WEEK OF EVERY MONTH THERE ARE MORE VISITS TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM BROWN DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE OF MALNUTRITION. SO AS AN OMBUDSMAN WE LOOK AT THIS IS A WORK DETERRENT. IF PEOPLE HAVE PROPER NUTRITION IF PEOPLE HAVE THE ADEQUATE FUNDS TO TAKE THE MEDICATIONS THAT THEY NEED THEY'RE NOT GOING TO END UP IN OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ON MEDI CAL. WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH MORE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

THE NEED FOR INCREASING SSI IN ESSAYS P. FOR RECIPIENTS IS CLEAR. PLEASE KNOW THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT STRATEGIES ON HOW WE CAN ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING MEANINGFUL IN THIS AREA AS WE COMBAT SENIOR POVERTY OR. JUST POVERTY IN GENERAL. IN A CALIFORNIA THAT'S DIVIDED AND MORE. INTO A DEEPENING INCOME INEQUALITY. WE'LL BE LOOKING CLOSELY AT ALL OPTIONS THAT ARE ON THE TABLE AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND WE'RE CRAFTING OUR ASSEMBLY VERSION. OF THE BUDGET. BUT I DO FEEL INCLINED TO SAY THAT LAST YEAR THIS BODY WANTED TO INCLUDE A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. INTO OUR BUDGET AND BELIEVE THAT WE WILL WANTS TO MAKE AND CONTINUE THAT SAME STYLE OF DISCUSSION. TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HELP TO RESTORE. WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM THOSE BEFORE? FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE ALSO WILL BE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN BE ASSISTING. ON. FIGURING OUT IF THERE IS A PATHWAY FORWARD WITH FOOD STAMPS. THE LAST YEAR AS YOU WILL SEE ON ISSUE TO WE WILL BE DISCUSSING IF THERE IS A POSSIBILITY FOR CALIFORNIA. TO BE THE FINAL STATE TO INSIST THAT FOOD STAMPS SHOULD GO TO THOSE WHO ARE ON SSI AND ASSESS BE. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON. TOO I BELIEVE ISSUE FOR JUST BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE A FLIGHT. SO WE CAN HAVE WILL LIGHT BORN STAY THERE. JUSTIN GUARANTEES TO COME OUT. GO FOR THAT. THANK YOU ARM AGAIN WILL LIGHT BORN DIRECTOR OF THE STATE STATE PARTNER SOCIAL SERVICES. ARMS THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM AS YOU KNOW IS ESSENTIALLY THE BACKBONE OF CALIFORNIANS HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED. SERVICE SYSTEM. ON WHAT IT IS ON. LARGER BY A MEASURE OF MANY TIMES THE NEXT LARGEST STATES OFFERING ON THIS KIND OF H. CBS. ON AND IT'S A MATTER OF I THINK SATISFACTION AND PRIDE TO CALIFORNIA BUT WE'RE ONE OF THE FEW STATES. THAT SPENDS MORE OF OUR MEDICAID LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. DOLLARS IN HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES RATHER THAN INSTITUTIONAL CARE SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER AGAIN TO. W. THOMPSON FROM ADULT PROGRAMS. THANK YOU. AFTERNOON AGAIN DEBBIE THOMPSON WITH ADULT PROGRAMS. CDSS AND YOU ALSO HAVE A HAND OUT TO. THAT WAS PROVIDED THAT GIVES AN OVERVIEW OF THE I. H. SAYS PROGRAMS AND SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE. BEEN GOING ON IN THAT PROGRAM IN THE LAST YEAR. LA I WILL AYE AGAIN WALK THROUGH THE POWER POINT AND POINT OUT WHAT IT CONTAINS. HAPPY TOO THEN RESPOND TO ANY. REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN ANY PARTICULAR AREA OR QUESTIONS ON THIS. HAND OUT OF IT ALSO COVERS ANOTHER ITEM ON THE AGENDA AROUND THE ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION SO. WE CAN CERTAINLY COVER THAT. THE OTHER TIME THIS WELL. THE BEGINNING OF THE POWER POINT. GIVE SOME INFORMATION GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE I JUST US PROGRAM. CURRENTLY WERE SERVING OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND RECIPIENTS AND CLOSE TO. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CARE PROVIDERS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO. THOSE INDIVIDUALS ON THAT SLIDE THREE BREAKS OUT A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION REGARDING. THE AGE GROUPS THAT WE SERVE WITHIN THE POPULATION NOW FIFTEEN PERCENT OVER EIGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD. THEN BECAUSE SITE FOR. COVERS INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THIS PROGRAM IS IS FUNDED. WILL BE ACTUALLY HAVE FOUR COMPONENTS TO THE AYE TO SUSS PROGRAM. FROM THREE OF AT TWO OF THEM ARE SHARE. HAVE A FIFTY PERCENT SHARE THE COMMUNITY FIRST CHOICE OPTION PROGRAM HAS A FIFTY SIX PERCENT FEDERAL SHARE AND THEN WE HAVE OUR. SMALL REMAINING RESIDUAL PROGRAM THAT IS FUNDED WITH STATE AND COUNTY FUNDS. THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN PROTECT PROJECTED BUDGET. FOR. AYE HHS IS ELEVEN POINT TWO BILLION. THAT'S ON SHOWS YOU THAT BREAK OUT ON PAGE FIVE. AND THEN THE NEXT FEW PAGES GO THROUGH SOME ADDITIONAL AYE DATA AROUND THE MAKEUP OF OUR PROGRAM. ON PAGE SEVEN YOU'LL SEE SOME SOME GENERAL INFORMATION THAT OFTEN INDIVIDUALS ARE INTERESTED IN. SUCH AS. MORE THAN HALF OF OUR RECIPIES PROVIDERS LIVE WITH ARE RECIPIENTS OF CARE. ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF OUR PROVIDERS WORK FOR A SINGLE RECIPIENT. FOR IT GIVES YOU A BREAK OUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT SLIDE OF KIND OF THE RELATIONSHIP. OF OUR PROVIDERS AND RECIPIENTS. SLIDE EIGHT BRINGS US INTO SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT RULES AROUND OVER TIME THAT CHANGED. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO NOW. AND THEN THE NEXT FEW SITES PROVIDE INFORMATION. OF. THAT. LIVE SHARED WITH YOU A NUMBER OF TIMES AROUND VIOLATIONS AND EXEMPTIONS. HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS ON THOSE. WE ALSO HAD LAST YEAR IMPLEMENTATION BY THE LEGISLATURE OF CODIFYING THE EXEMPTIONS. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF. IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THOSE NEW RULES. DISC THAT COUNTIES WILL BE TAKING OVER DECISION MAKING OF THE EXEMPTION TO USE. AND THE STATE WILL HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS THAT WILL BE PUT IN PLACE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. THE ADVOCATES THAT SUPPORTED THIS LEGISLATION ON THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESSES WE HAVE DIRECTION THAT WILL BE. RELEASED SHORTLY AND THE TRANSITION TO THE COUNTY SYSTEM HAPPENED IN MAY. I BELIEVE YOU'RE PRESENTING ON ISSUE SIX CAP AND MY TIME HOMES OR EVEN. IF I CANNOT WE DON'T DO UNTIL A LITTLE SIX. YEAH IF THAT'S OKAY FOR NOW AND. STOP. TECH. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE CURRENTLY ON THE STATE COUNTY COST SHARING CHANGES. IF I MAY JUST INTRODUCE IT AS YOU'LL RECALL THAT WHEN THE STATE INITIATED COORDINATED. CARE THE CONTINUE THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE WHICH WAS. IS AN ATTEMPT TO BRING ALL OF THE LONGTERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS INTO A MANAGED CARE ENVIRONMENT STARTING OUT IN. WHAT AMOUNTED TO SIX COUNTIES IN THE EXPECT? POSSIBILITY OF EXPANSION. AFTER THE FIRST OF SEVERAL YEARS OF THE CCI IMPLEMENTATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT IN FACT. ARM COST ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE STATE HAS HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN PROJECTED. AND. BASED ON THAT THE EYE EXERCISE PROGRAM WAS DE LINKED FROM THE OF THE CCRI. NOT HAVE AN AFFECT ON THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENT HE TO PUT IN PLACE AND SO OVER A PERIOD OF SOME MONTHS. THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE COUNTIES THROUGH C. SACK ALL NEGOTIATED A REPLACEMENT SYSTEM OF FINANCING THAT IS NOW IN PLACE. IT INVOLVES A. CHANGED COST SHARING RATIO IS INVOLVED THE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT COMPONENT OF MAINTENANCE ABOUT BUT GROWTH COMPONENT. PROVIDES THAT OF AFTER TWO YEARS OF THIS PROCESS THERE WILL BE A LOOK BACK. AT WHICH POINT. DISPUESTOS OF OUR. GROUP EXAMINATION OF HAVE THE REALIGNMENT FUNDS FLOWED IN THE WAYS THAT WERE EXPECTED. ARM THEN DOESN'T NEED ANY FURTHER ON. COMMENDATION. ON ADDITIONALLY IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND WITH LEGISLATION JUST ADOPTED LAST WEEK INSIDE THIS WEEK BY THE GOVERNOR. ARMED THERE WERE SOME CHANGES MADE TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL WAGE PROVISIONS. ON DOT A SPY SENSUALLY ARE INTENDED TO FACILITATE COUNTIES THAT WISH TO ANTICIPATE INCREASES IN THE MINIMUM WAGE. TO FORM THOSE WITHOUT. TAKING ON ALL OF THE COST OBLIGATIONS OF SUBSEQUENT MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES THOSE ARE NOW IN PLACE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE. AND WE EXPECT THAT TO SORT OF. FLOW FORWARD PALM. QUESTION THAT WAS POSED LAST WEEK AND SENATE HEARING WAS HOW HAS THE BARGAINING RELATIONSHIP GONE THAT POINT I SAID AS FAR AS WE KNOW SMOOTHLY THAT WE WEREN'T AWARE OF ANY. ALL. SITUATIONS IN WHICH LABOR HAD REQUESTED THAT COUNTIES GO TO A VERY. FACT FINDING MEDIATION PROCESS WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED THAT THERE ARE FIVE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THAT HAS HAPPENED SO. MORE TO COME SEE HOW THAT RESULTS IT'S. I THINK IT DIRECTOR. JUST UNDER THE SEAT. HOW IT JUSTIN GARRETT OUTLETS THAT REPRESENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES SOMEONE I THINK THE CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO? TALK THE TODAY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE ACCESS FISCAL STRUCTURE. ALSO WANNA OF KNOWLEDGE THE STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THAT TIME AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT FINANCE ON IMPLEMENTATION. HE'S BEEN REALLY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN COUNTIES OF PARTNER. TO. ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THEM THROUGH THIS FIRST YEAR. ON THIS PROGRESS IS INCLUDED ESTABLISHING THE NEW COUNTY MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT. AS WELL DETERMINE THE PROCESS FOR HOW TO REDIRECT THE REALIGNMENT GROWTH FUNDING HARM TO SOCIAL SERVICES TO OFFSET. AYE SAYS CASAS IS FUNNY WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN USE FOR VITAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ON THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FRONT WE AGAIN APPRECIATE. THE PARTNERSHIP IN ATTORNEY NAM HOW THE BEST WAY TO IMPLEMENT THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THERE WERE AND. IT'S PRETTY THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL ADOPTING AB ONE TEN AND THAT GOING INTO ON THAT ARE REALLY ALLOW. A VITAL GUIDANCE TO MOVE FORWARD TO COUNTIES ON HOW THESE TOOLS TO WORK AND HOW TO CALCULATE COSTS FOR POTENTIAL INCREASES SEWER. APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS THERE. FOR COUNTY ADMINISTRATION FUNDING WITH THE CHANGES THAT ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY. ARE LOOKING FOR IN SUPPORT OF THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF FUNDING NAM TO ENSURE THAT. I COUNTY COST ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM ALIGN APPROPRIATELY WITH STATE FUNDING. I'M LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE. YOU KNOW COUNTIES ARE MANAGING TO. YOU HANDLE THE IMPACT OF THIS THIS NEW KASHIF THEM IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS IN MOVING FORWARD ON IMPLEMENTATION BUT I'M. YOU KNOW WE COUNTIES MAINTAIN THOSE OUT YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THIS DEAL WILL LOOK LIKE COME YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE SUBCOMMITTEE I'M. HIGHLIGHTING THE OVERCOME THAT WE OPEN A PROVISION ON THE SKIN IT REMAIN A TOP PRIORITY FOR COUNTIES. THE ABILITY TO REEXAMINE THIS FUNDING STRUCTURE AND AND LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON OTHER REALIGNMENT PROGRAMS I'M WITH THE REQUIRED JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT. NOW MIDDLE BE VITAL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE I COUNTIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY A LONG TERM SOLUTION TO THE ENSURE THAT COUNTIES CAN CONTINUE TO ADMINISTER. I POSSESS AND OTHER CRITICAL SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. THANK YOU. CLICK. I LEóN DEPARTMENT FUNDS. AS THE PANEL MENTIONED AT THIS YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTIES DEVELOP A REVISED BUDGET METHODOLOGY AS IT RELATES TO I JUST US ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND COSTS AND AS MENTIONED IN THE AGENDA AND THE STAFF COMMENTS ON. OUR OFFICE. NOTED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SIGNALED AND RE EVALUATING THOSE ARE VICE BUDGETING METHODOLOGIES AS A PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. I'M SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT PARTICULAR DATA OR MEASURES TO ASSESS THE. ACCURACY OR THE REASON ABILITY OF THE REVISED BUDGETING AND ASSUMPTIONS MORE THAN HAPPY TO ASSIST IN ANY WAY THE MEMBERS AND. CRAFTING THAT LANGUAGE YOU'RE LOOKING AT PARTICULAR MEASURES THAT YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER. THANK YOU. WE CONTINUE COMMITTED TO THE BUDGET DEAL REACHED LAST YEAR AND ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNTY AND STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. BUT THIS TIME WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOR AND IF I MAY ASK THOSE WHO HAVE FLIGHTS IMMINENTLY. IF THEY CAN GO FIRST AND THEN AND IN THE PUBLIC COMMENT. THE CHANNEL RESTORING OF OR SOMEHOW THE URBAN CARRIES A CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO CONCUR WITH THE COMMENTS BY C. SACK. NOTE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE THEIR URGENCY OR THAT NECESSITY NECESSARY. FOR THE ROPER CLAWS AND ALSO WANT TO KNOW. MANY OTHER URBAN COUNTIES. ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE KITCHEN ITIS ADMIN COSTS WHICH WE ARE GETTING TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY GENERALLY WHEN I THINK THE RESTORATION. FOR GETTING TO WORK THESE ISSUES OUT AND CLEAN THE WAGE SUPPLEMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. SHANNON PRIMER FROM SAN DIEGO VERY THANKFUL FOR YOU GUYS MOVING THIS UP SO THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO TESTIFY BEFORE FLYING HOME. I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS. AND IF I DON'T GET A TEST FIND THE OTHER I JUST US ONCE I'M ALSO IN SUPPORT. OF THOSE. I DID REALLY QUICKLY WANT TO SAY ABOUT THAT EVEY V. PAR AS A PARENT OF A DISABLED CHILD WHO HAS PROTECTIVE SERVICES IF I HAVE TO TAKE THE TIME TO DO THIS THING. I'M NOT GONNA BE KEEPING MY EYES ON MY KID AND I'M NOT GONNA BE DOING WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS PAYING ME TO DO. SO WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO TAKE MY KID OFF MY EYES OFF MY KID WHEN YOU'RE PAYING ME TO KEEP HIM SAFE. SO I JUST LEFT AGO. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE FOR. SEEING NONE ALL BRING IT UP TO THE DICE TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT AS WE PREPARE FOR THAT WE OPEN OUR CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR CAN I ASK THE LA GO TO ASSIST US WITH DRAFTING SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE. FOR US TO CONSIDER THAT WOULD CAPTURE THE ADDITIONAL DATA GOALS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS WOULD WANT TO HAVE. THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL TO FURTHER THE CONVERSATION AS WE CONSIDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT. ON THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW AND WE. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FOR OPEN. WE'LL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO THE GROUPS ARE WITH YOU JACQUI. I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT. SHE'S BEEN PASSED OUT THERE ALSO OUT IN THE HALLWAY IF PEOPLE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO PICK THEM UP JUST REALLY DOING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF ENDING THE SS I CASH OUT THEN ON PAGE ONE REAP BRIEFLY DESCRIBE WHAT THE SS I CASH OUT. IS IT REALLY IS A NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR STATES WERE GIVEN THE OPTION. OF INCREASING THE MONTHLY ASSIST P. GRANT WHICH IS THE STATE PORTION OF THE S. LACES P. GRANT. A BY TEN DOLLARS IN LIEU OF RECIPIENTS BEING ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FOOD BENEFIT SO THIS EFFECTIVELY CASH THEM OUT. A FEDERAL FOOD BENEFITS CALLED BECOME FRESH PROGRAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE WOULD KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY IS THE ONLY STATE WITH THIS. WITH THE CASH A POLICY IN PLACE. AND IF YOU MOVE. TO PAGE TWO WE JUST NOTE THAT AS A PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET DELIBERATIONS ARE OFFICE WAS TOSSED TO WRITE A REPORT LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL PROGRAMMATIC AND FISCAL AFFECTS OF ENDING THE REPORT WE DID FACE SIGNIFICANT DATA LIMITATIONS BUT LUCKILY WE WERE ABLE TO RELY ON PASSED ANALYSIS DONE BY MATHEMATICA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO GET A AT LEAST OF A HIGH LEVEL PICTURE OF THE POTENTIAL OF FACTS WHICH WE LAY OUT. AND PAGE THREE MAINLY THROUGH A PIE CHART AND AS YOU SEE. THE MAJORITY OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM AND INDEED SSI CASH OUT MOST OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS WOULD BENEFIT IN THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD BECOME. NEWLY INELIGIBLE AND THEN AND ROLE IN CAL FRESH AND IT'S ESTIMATED THROUGH THE ESTIMATES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE. ON AVERAGE SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS IN MONTHLY FOOD BENEFITS HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE SOME HOUSE SONGS THAT WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ENDING% THE SSI CASH ON THIS IS MAINLY THROUGH THE FORM OF SEEING A REDUCTION. AND FOOD BENEFITS THAT THE HOUSEHOLD WOULD RECEIVE MAJORITY OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS INTERNET WILL BE AFFECTED AS SEEN IN THE PART CHART WOULD STILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR CAL FRESH BUT WOULD RECEIVE A LOWER FOOD BENEFIT AMOUNT. AND AGAIN IT'S EXPECTED THAT THEIR FOOD BENEFITS ON AVERAGE WOULD DECREASE BY EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS A MONTH. WE WOULD NOTE THAT ACROSS AND THESE HOUSEHOLDS THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD BENEFIT IN THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. IN GENERAL THOSE HOUSES THAT WOULD BENEFIT TEND TO HAVE LESS INCOME THAN THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT WOULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED AN OVERALL WHEN YOU NET OUT THE LOSSES ON THE STATEWIDE TOTAL. AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE STATE BY ENDING THE US I CASH OUT COULD POTENTIALLY DRAW DOWN AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FOOD BENEFITS. MOVING ON TO PAGE FIVE. THE S. ORAL ALSO TIME STAR OFFICE AND TO LOOK AT POTENTIAL OPTIONS ON FOR HOLDING HOUSEHOLDS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY AND AND YES I CASH OUT HARMLESS. AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF ANY HOLD HARMLESS POLICY REALLY VARIES ON. BASED OFF OF HOW YOU STRUCTURE IT I'M WE LAY OUT ME I MADE MAIN FACTORS AND TO BE CONSIDERED A CONSTRUCTING A HOLD HARMLESS ONE BEING WHO IS ELIGIBLE. WOULD IT. BE A TARGETED HOLD HARMLESS BUT TARGET SPECIFIC HOUSEHOLDS BASED OFF OF VARIOUS CRITERIA SUCH AS NEED POVERTY HOUSEHOLD SIZE WHETHER HOUSEHOLD HAS A CHILD WHETHER HOUSEHOLD IS ON CAL WORKS SIX CETERA OR WOULD IT BE MORE EXPANSIVE APPROACH THAT WOULD TRY TO CAPTURE. ALL HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE NEGATIVELY HARMED. I'M AND AGAIN THE MORE INDIVIDUALS WITH KNOWLEDGE OF FOR THE HOLD HARMLESS THE MORE COSTLY THE HOLD HARMLESS WOULD BE. ANOTHER FACTOR WOULD BE THE DURATION OF THE HOLD HARMLESS WOULD IT BE ISHQ A TEMPORARY MORE LONG TERM PERMANENT HOLD HARMLESS. ANOTHER FACTOR TO CONSIDER IS WHAT WOULD THE BENEFIT AMOUNT BE WHAT THE HOLD HARMLESS SEEK TO FULLY BACK FILL THE LOSS IN FOOD BENEFITS OR WOULD IT SEEK TO ONLY. PARTIALLY. RESTORE A THE PORTION OF THE LOS FOOD BENEFITS THAT HOUSE WITH MAY SEEM. AND LASTLY ANOTHER FACTOR TO CONSIDER THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE COSTS IN THE ADMINISTRATION AUTOMATION COMPLEXITY OF THE OF IT ALL IS. AND HOW COMPLICATED WITH THE HOLD HARMLESS BE. AND THAT'S REALLY INFORMED BY THE THREE FACTORS WE DISCUSSED ABOVE. NOBODY GOING TO MORE DETAIL OF THE HOLD HARMLESS POLICY OPTIONS BUT. THOSE* JUST THE BIG OVERVIEW NOT I'LL END MY COMMENTS WITH THE QUESTIONS THAT WE LAY OUT IN PAGE SEVEN WHICH WE JUST IDENTIFIED AS KEY ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION MOVING FORWARD. ONE IS DEVELOPING MORE UP TO DATE ESTIMATES ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ENDING THE SSI CASH COULD HAVE ON HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE. GIVEN THE FACT BUT SINCE DSS DEVELOPED THEIR ESTIMATES AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES THAT MAY AFFECT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON HOUSEHOLD SIZE THAN THAT. AMOUNT OF BENEFITS THAT HOW A NEWLY ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS COULD RECEIVE AND IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON UPDATING THEIR ESTIMATES. ANOTHER KEY ISSUE FOR CONSIDERATION IS THE STATE REALLY IDENTIFYING WAYS TO MAXIMIZE CAO FRESH PARTICIPATION RATE AND THIS REALLY MATTERS AND WE'RE DEALING WITH THE NEWLY ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE. JUST LIKE IN THE CURRENT HELFRICH PROGRAM NOT ALL HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE ARE PARTICIPATING IN CONFERENCE THEY'RE NOT AND ROLLING. SO REALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF HOW DOES THE STATE MAXIMIZE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FOOD BENEFITS WE COULD DRAW DOWN BY ENDING THE SI CASH OUT. LOOKING AT WAYS TO FURTHER SIMPLIFIER STREAMLINED THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR THOSE NEWLY ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS. AND LASTLY IDENTIFYING WAYS TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL AUTOMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED BOTH WITH ENDING THE SSI CASH OUT AND ANY POTENTIAL HOLD HARMLESS POLICY. IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY SEEK TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND AND THINK ABOUT. AT WAYS TO MITIGATE ANY CHALLENGES THAT MAY ARISE AND WITHOUT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT LOVE MIKE HERALD FROM. SENATOR LONG PUBLIC. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YES MY CAR WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND I'M HERE WITH LISA LOPEZ UNNECESSARY RECIPIENT WILL SPEAK IN A MOMENT ABOUT HER SITUATION. SO I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT I THINK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF. OF CALIFORNIANS FOR US TO SIGN THE WESTERN CENTER. YOU KNOW I THINK OF THIS ISSUE BACK CASH OUT IT'S BEEN ON THE TABLE FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS THIS IS NOT A NEW SUBJECT AND. I DO FEEL LIKE. WITH THE REPORT THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THIS BODY AND WAS PUT TOGETHER BY THE LA EL I THINK HAS. SORT OF. RAISE THE GAME IF YOU WILL ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS THE TIME TO BE REALLY MOVING FORWARD ON ANY CASH OUT AND GETTING. A SNAP BENEFITS TO RECIPIENTS ANDI WANT TO JUST SAY THAT WHEN YOU TALK TO RECIPIENTS ACROSS THE BOARD YOU HEARD MANY OF THEM TESTIFIED JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. THEY REALLY WANT SNAP BENEFITS AND THEY KNOW WHY TO BECAUSE. NGUYEN SNAPPERS INCOME THAT CAN'T BE TAKEN AWAY BY RENT INCREASES STAYS AND WITH THEM IT'S SOMETHING THAT PROTECTS THEM ALLOWS HIM TO HAVE THAT FOOD THAT THEY. ARE RIGHT NOW HAVING TO GO TO SO MANY THE FOOD BANKS AND OTHER FOOD PANTRIES TO GET ASSISTANCE FOR. BUT WHEN WE'VE SPOKEN WITH CLIENTS THAT WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR WE SHARED WITH HIM THE RESULTS OF THE ALLEY ó REPORT AND SHOWED HIM THAT THERE WERE GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FAMILIES WHO WERE GOING TO LOSE BENEFITS. THEY WERE LIKE NO WE DON'T WANT IT TO END CASH OUT ON THE BACKS OF OTHER PEOPLE. THIS HAS TO BE DONE IN A WAY IN WHICH EVERYONE GETS TO KEEP THEIR BENEFITS IF THEY ARE CURRENTLY GETTING THEM WE DON'T WANNA HURT ANYBODY. YES WE WANT TO GET OUR SNAP BENEFITS AND WE THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO BUT WE HAVE TO FIGUREOUT A WAY TO DO THIS IN A WAY WHERE IN WHICH WE DON'T HARM FAMILIES WHO WERE LIVING IN POVERTY ALSO. SO I'D I THINK THERE WAS THERE'S SOMETHING QUITE NOBLE ABOUT THAT AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT. ALL OF US WHO WERE WORKING UP HERE IN THE CAPITAL NEED TO TAKE NOTE OF AND REALLY TRY TO ENDEAVOR AND MOVE TOWARDS. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE AT THIS POINT NOW WHERE WE MUST MOVE BEYOND. YOU KNOW LET'S COULD PRODUCE ANOTHER REPORT LET'S. LET'S THINK ABOUT IT SOME MORE AND WE NEED TO MOVE TOMORE OF AN ACTION ORIENTED APPROACH. AND SO WHAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE IS TO DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT. OF AND THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND PARTLY SO SERVICE THAT IS TO WORK WITH US WORK WITH ALEJO AND OTHERS TO TRY TO REALLY DIG DOWN INTO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN RAISED BY THE LA GO. BY THE TIME THE MAY REVISE AND GIVE THIS COMMITTEE AND THE OTHER THIS OTHER COMMITTEE IN YOUR. COUNTERPART IN THE SENATE INFORMATION ON A NUMBER OF KEY QUESTIONS WHICH WE THINK WE NEED TO GET ADDRESS. ONE WE WE WE THINK THAT APART WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT APARTMENT COMEBACK TO THE LEGISLATURE INTO ADVOCATES AND STAKEHOLDERS WITH. SOME OPTIONS FOR HOLD HARMLESS WHAT WOULD HOW WOULD THEY WORK WHAT WOULD BE THE COST OF THEM WHAT WOULD BE THE WAYS THAT WE'VE DELIVER THAT BENEFIT TO PERSONS AND WHAT ARE THE TRADE OFFS. OF USING ONE DELIVERY SYSTEM OVER ANOTHER ONE AND WHAT ARE THE COSTS THAT MIGHT BE IMPLICATED FROM THOSE VERY STE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES WITH AFTER. HAVE. SECONDLY WE THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A PLAN FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO TWO THINGS ONE HOW DO WE IN ROLE PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY SSI RECIPIENTS BUT NOT. IN SNAP WHAT IS THE ROLL OUT PLAN MUCH AS WE DID WITH COVERED CALIFORNIA WHEN WE HAD THE ACA THE STATE HAD TO DEVELOP A VERY. SOPHISTICATED AND SMART PLAN AND WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS THE STATE IS REALLY GOOD AT IT BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT PLANET NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH AND I WOULD SUGGEST THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT THE COST OF THAT'S GOING TO BE. SO THAT WE DO IT EFFECTIVELY AND QUICKLY. AND THEN THIRD. WE WOULD THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN OURSELVES WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT ALL THE LEGAL STEPS IN TIME LINES ARE TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS POLICY. WHAT'S REQUIRED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TERMS OF PERMISSION IF SUCH A THING IS REQUIRED WHAT WAIVERS WITH THE DEPARTMENT NEED TO SEEK IN WHAT WOULD BE THE TIMELINE. FOR SEEKING THOSE IN GETTING THOSE BACK. AND THEN I THINK. YOU KNOW HAVING ALL THAT INFORMATION IN HAND. THEN I THINK IT WOULD BE. MORE POSSIBLE FOR US TO ARRIVE AT A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER NOT WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ENDING CASH OUT OR NOT. AND I WANT TO UNDERSCORE AGAIN THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS ARE REALLY CRITICAL. WE IF WE CAN ARRIVE IT I THINK A COMPROMISE AMONG ALL THE PARTIES ON THIS. THAT WOULD BE REALLY SOMETHING SPECIAL AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO REALLY STRIVE FOR IF WE CAN GET IT DONE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. IF NOT I THINK WE AT LEAST HAVE A GAME PLAN SET DOWN WE WILL KNOW WHAT ALL THE ANSWERS ARE ALL THE STEPS ARE EVERYTHING IF WE CHOOSE IN THE FUTURE. TO MOVE ON ENDING CASH OUT WE WILL BE FARTHER MUCH FURTHER ADVANCED IN ACHIEVING THAT GOAL IN THE TIME COMES. FOR NOW THOUGH I THINK WE ARE TO KEEP OUR. FOOT TO THE PANEL. IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS AND TRY TO SEE HOW FAR WE CAN GET AND. SEE IF THIS IS THE YEAR THAT WE CAN FINALLY BEGIN TO END CASH OUT IN CALIFORNIA AND JOIN THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES. AND WITHOUT I'M GOING TO ALLOW MISS LOPEZ TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HER SITUATION. I'M MY NAME'S LISA LOPEZ. I AM ON THE BOARD AB SHE COMMITTEE FOR THE FOOD BANK ACCOUNT CONSTANCE LONG COUNTY.

I TRY TO GO BREAST BILLS. OMAR. ON BALCONIES I COULD EAT BETTER OF. IN A IS JUST TOO SMALL PLACE TO REALLY GROW FOOD. SO I SUPPORT A. WHO STANDS FOR SS I PEOPLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH? THANK YOU SIR. HI MY MY NAME IS CINDY SIEGEL THE FOOD BANK OF COMP CASA. DOWN THE A COUNTY AND I'M NEARLY OBVIOUSLY NOT JUST BECAUSE HE IS SO. AND IT THE THING THAT I TOLD YOU BEFORE ABOUT KNOWING THE NAMES OF THE SENIORS THAT I HELD. SERVE MY CLIENTS YOU KNOW THE KIDS NAMES TO. AND I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE BECAUSE. I KNOW IT'S IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID DATA HOW MUCH THIS HELPS CHILDREN. BERNARD ONE TO REMIND YOU THAT WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW WAS THE NUMBER CHILDREN IN. CALIFORNIA THAT LIVE IN POVERTY AND HOW. HOW IMPORTANT IT IS RIGHT THAT THAT FOR KIDS THIS IS AN EXTRA EX NUMBER DOLLARS FOR THE PARENTS THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE MANY TIMES BETWEEN SUCCESS AND A LACK OF SUCCESS IN SCHOOL RIGHT? TO DIFFERENTIATE AND HAVING LESS OF A DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THEIR NON IMPOVERISHED APPEARS READY ALERTS YOU TO KEEP IN MIND THAT. YOU HAVE A LOT OF ADULTS SPEAKING BUT DAHLE LOT OF US ARE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE POPULATION THIS IS LIKELY TO. HELP BENEFIT THE MOST AND THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO REMIND YOU OF IS THAT THE THING ABOUT. FOOD STAMPS CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL DEPENDING ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW IS THAT A LOT OF PLACES WILL MATCH. FOOD STAMPS WERE ENABLE YOU TO DOUBLE IT OR IF YOU'RE USING IT THEY'LL GIVE YOU A BENEFIT. AND ALL OF THE CLIENTS I TALK TO ON. THE REASON THAT THEY LIKE THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GO INTO A GROCERY STORE OR A FARMER'S MARKET. BECAUSE REMEMBER IN THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SILLY THING THAT MANY OF US WHO NEVER EXPERIENCES TAKE FOR GRANTED. AND THAT IS THE ABILITY TO TRY SOMETHING NEW. TO HAVE YOUR HAVE A HEALTHIER DIET PRISON ACTUAL LITERAL COST OF THAT. AND. PARENTS WERE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THEIR CHILDREN TO EAT HEALTHIER FOODS OFTEN ARE FACED WITH A RIDICULOUS CHOICE OF. HOPING THAT THE LIKE THE VEGETABLE. AND KNOWING THAT IF THEY DON'T. THEY'RE STUCK WITH SOMETHING THAT BASICALLY THEN BECOMES WASTEFUL SO. IN ESSENCE AGAIN THIS THIS IDEA OF. A BENEFIT ON THAT ALLOWS THEM TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE MORE FOOD OR DIFFERENT HOOTERS DOUBLE ACTUALLY ALLOWS THEM TO INTRODUCE THEIR KIDS TO A DIFFERENT TYPE OF FOOD IN OFTENTIMES MORE NUTRITIOUS TYPE OF FOOD SO. AGAIN YOU KNOW DON'T TO SEE IT AS YOU KNOW THE SET AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE ON. GIVEN TO PARENTS SO TO SPEAK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS ACTUALLY HELPING THE NEXT GENERATION TO GROW TO THEIR FULLEST POTENTIAL. THANK YOU. GIVEN. BUT I AM IS ALSO VERY FOR. CALIFORNIA'S FOR SSI. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M A SUPPORTER OF ENDING CASH OUT. PENDING OR DEPENDENT UPON A COMPREHENSIVE AND PERMANENT HOLD HARMLESS.

WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TO OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE.

WITHOUT IT WITHOUT IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES WE DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER HELP. THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT. AND. AS HE CAN KNOW. CARE GIVING IS A VERY INTENSE AND UNPREDICTABLE. DEMANDING JOB. AND I'VE WORKED A VARIETY OF THE INDUSTRY'S BEFORE MY SON WAS BORN. AND. THIS BY FAR IS THE HARDEST JOB I'VE EVER HAD BUT ALSO THE MOST REWARDING. AND. AT LEAST IN MY FAMILY'S CASE A. WE DO MULTIPLE TASKS AT ONCE. YOU KNOW. WE CAN'T JUST DO ONE AND I COULD BE PREPARING HIS FOOD FOR ONE SECOND. HI COULD THEN BE IN THE MIDDLE OF CHANGING HIS DIAPER HE'S NOT. TOILET TRAINED HE DOESN'T SELF FEED. AND IF I DON'T GET TO THAT TOILET TRAINING ARE CHANGING THE DIAPER YOU CAN BE ASSURED THERE'S A HUGE MESS ALL OVER THE PLACE. I HAD A SITUATION WHERE I DID LITERALLY SIX TASS TOOK SIX DIFFERENT TYPES OF TASKS THAT ARE LISTED ON AYE H. ASSESS. WITHIN TEN MINUTES. HOW MY SUPPOSED?

BUT THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IT SOMEWHAT COMPLAINING I'M JUST SAYING. YOU KNOW ADDING MORE TO IT. WE REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT HOW THIS IS GONNA BE. IMPLEMENTED. AND IN DOING SO WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SERIOUS MATTER IF THE INVASION OF THE PRIVACY AND AT LEAST IN MY SON'S CASE. OF A MINOR. IT'S REALLY NOBODY'S BUSINESS HOW MANY TIMES BECAUSE THE BATHROOM IN A GIVEN DAY. AND THE PRIVACY OF OTHERS YOU KNOW. A YOUNG OR OLD YOU KNOW NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE THEIR LIVES INVADED SO THE LEAST. RESTRICTIVE MANNER IS A KEY TO HAVE LESS. I HEARD YOU GUYS CAREFULLY. TO CONSIDER HOW YOU'RE IMPLEMENTING THIS. KEEP OUR VOICES IN MIND HAPLESS PARTY NOW PARTY TO YOUR DECISIONS. AND. BEFORE MOVING FORWARD AND. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT OUR CLIENTS GET THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE IN THE SAFEST MANNER I MEAN. THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR IS TO KEEP OUR. OUR LOVED ONES SAFE SO THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU TO. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO RETURN BACK TO. I CAN FOLLOW UP ON A CRISTINA DYLAN TIFFANY WOULD. HI W. THOMPSON. I DEPUTY DIRECTOR ADULT PROGRAMS. AND VIA ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION AS YEAR. PROBABLY ALL AWARE WAS. PART OF THE FEDERAL CURES OCT. THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. AND. SO. THE FIRST THING I I WANNA SAY IS THE STATE IS INCREDIBLY COMMITTED. TO DOING EXACTLY WITH WHAT WITH WHAT WAS SHARED WITH US JUST A MOMENT AGO. WHICH IS TO LISTEN TO AND HEAR THE VOICES OF OUR RECIPIENTS ARE PROVIDERS. ARE STAKEHOLDERS IN LOOKING AT HOW TO APPROACH THIS IMPLEMENTATION. AND WE HAVE STARTED THAT PROCESS. WE STARTED IT LAST FALL. WE BROUGHT TOGETHER MANY STAKEHOLDERS ON THERE WAS ABOUT TWO OR THREE HUNDRED THAT PARTICIPATED IN. I CAUGHT WORKS WORKGROUP THEN. THAT WAS TO INFORM OUR INITIAL. OUT REACH FOR A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. TO FIND OUT ABOUT DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO LOOKING AT ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION TO SEE OF ANY OF THEM WOULD. WORK FOR THE WAY I AM THE PROGRAMS ARE OPERATED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION WHEN OUT IN NOVEMBER. RESPONSES CAME BACK IN DECEMBER AND WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THOSE LAST WEEK WE HAD ANOTHER STAKEHOLDER MEETING TO START SHARING ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THAT. ONE OF THE. OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO. ASSASSIN IS ANY OTHER INFORMATION COMING FROM. THAT SEE A MASS THE PHONE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AROUND THIS HOUSE FOREST LOOKING OUT WHAT. WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THIS WORK THE BEST WE CAN IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS? THE WAY WE OPERATE THE I SUSPECT PROGRAM. WE DID AT THAT. STAKEHOLDER MEETING TRIED TO START SHARING WHAT WE KNOW AND THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO SHARE WITH WET WITH FOLKS. ABOUT HOW WERE ABOUT PHONE APPROACHING THIS US FAR TO HELP TRY AND START ALLEVIATING SOME OF THE FEARS AND CONCERNS THAT. INDIVIDUALS ARE HAVING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS. I STARTED. ON. THAT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO A THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE AND LISTENING APPROACH TO THIS. THAT ACTUALLY A PART OF THE STATUTE DOES SAY THAT IT IS TO BE INVOLVING STAKEHOLDERS AND THAT IT IS TO. DO THE LEAST CUMBERSOME PROCESS AND WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE LOOK AT OUT THAT AS THE CORE OF OUR APPROACH TO THIS AND KNOWING THAT. WHILE THIS IS A REQUIRED. IMPLEMENTATION BY JANUARY NIGHT BUT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE KNOW THAT TO DO THAT IN CALIFORNIA IS IS NOT POSSIBLE. AND THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH CM BASS AROUND GOOD FAITH EXTENSIONS SO THAT WE CAN DO THIS CORRECTLY AND THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE HEAR ALL OF THE VOICES THAT. THAT WE NEED TO AND HOW WE APPROACH THIS. SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT DURING THAT STAKEHOLDER. MEETING IS THE ENGAGEMENT PLAN FOR STAKEHOLDERS AND ARE RECIPIENTS AND PROVIDERS AND AND THE DIFFERENT. WAYS THAT WE INTEND TO. UMPS. SHARE AND LISTEN YOU YOU GOT A COPY OF SOCKS TODAY. ONE OF THE FEARS THAT CAME UP. LAST FALL WAS THE CONCERN ABOUT ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO ONLY RECEIVE SERVICES IN THE HOME. AND NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMUNITY. WE ASSURED PEOPLE THAT THAT IS NOT IN ANYWAY THE INTENT OF. THAT THE DEPARTMENT THE STATE THAT WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE AND. THAT WE WILL IMPLEMENT THIS SO THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES WHERE THEY NEED THEM IF THEY'RE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THEN THAT'S WHERE THEY GET THEM. IT EBV SHOULD NOT CHANGE. ANYTHING ABOUT HOW SERVICES ARE DELIVERED IN THAT IN THAT SENSE. ON ANOTHER THING THAT WAS BROUGHT UP JUST BY THE THE WOMAN THAT SHARED WITH US A FEW MOMENTS AGO. ON THE FEAR AROUND HAVING TO CHECK IN AND CHECK OUT BY SERVICE. NO THAT'S NOT HOW IT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED HERE AND SEE A MOUSE HOUSE ALSO. SHARED THAT THAT IS NOT THE EXPECTATION THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO BE AT A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL AS FAR AS TYPE OF SERVICE. FEAR FEARS AROUND. GPS AND BEING TRAPPED WHERE PEOPLE ARE. IT'S GPS IS NOT A REQUIREMENT OF EBV AND THE STATE DOES NOT INTEND TO UTILIZE THAT AS AN IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH. ALSO I I THINK THE MAIN THING THAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY IS OUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING TO LISTEN TO THESE FEARS AND CONCERNS. AND LOOK AT WAYS THAT WE CAN DO THIS THAT WILL BE. ON THE LEAST BURDENSOME AND. THAT WE CAN ON THEM. I'D ADOPT A WAY TO DO THIS FOR. CALIFORNIA AND THAT MAKES SOME SENSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE'RE GONNA HAVE CRISTINA ABOUT HIM. THINK YOU DOCTOR A BILL AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR BEING FLEXIBLE IN ALLOWING OUR OUR MEMBER TO TESTIFY EARLIER. I DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH MORE TO A OUTSIDE I THINK SHE SPOKE VERY ELOQUENTLY. EXCEPT TO SAY THAT UW IS. OPPOSED TO E. V. V. WE DO UNDERSTAND IT'S A FEDERAL MANDATE. SO IT'S COMPLICATED BUT JUST WANT TO EXPRESS OUR OPPOSITION TO THE CONCEPT IN GENERAL BUT ALSO. APPRECIATION TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR EXPRESSING. GENUINE. CONCERNED WITH DOING IT DOING THIS IN A WAY THAT'S NOT HARMFUL THANK YOU. IF ANYONE AT THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION I'M WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS BY THE DEPARTMENT TO PROTECT THE DIGNITY AND THE PRIVACY OF THE RECIPIENTS AND PRIVACY. AS WELL AS INDICATING THAT THE STATE WOULD NOT BE READY TO ROLL OUT IMPLEMENTATION ON JANUARY ONE HOWEVER WE REMAIN OPPOSED. ABSENT GUIDANCE FROM CMS AND A REAL COST ANALYSIS BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION THERE'S TOO LITTLE INFORMATION TO MOVE FORWARD EBV IS A BURDEN SOME REQUIREMENT THAT CAN POTENTIALLY LEAD TO A DECLINE IN AUTHORIZED HOURS. IS INVASIVE OF CONSUMER PROVIDER PRIVACY AND YET ANOTHER REQUIREMENT PLACED ON AYE AGES AS PROVIDERS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FULFILL WITHOUT COMPENSATION ARE PROVIDERS WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE QUALITY CARE TO THEIR CONSUMERS. AND THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE WAY IN EBV WOULD JEOPARDIZE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WILL HAVE MICHELLE ROSSI. OKAY A GOOD AFTER DID IT TAKE YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. UP MANY SPECIAL ROSY OF HHS CONSUMER ADVOCATE HERE AT THE STATE. OF. EVEN THE REAL WORLD AS MANY OF STATE EVER. PUT. THINGS HAVE PLACE BETTER REALLY BAD FOR THE HSS PROGRAM AS A CONSUMER. I HEALTH CONCERNS THAT. OF MAKE KATIE BY CARE PROVIDER THAT I'VE HAD FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS BECAUSE WE'RE IMPLEMENTING. HOMES. OF REQUIREMENTS DAY THAT IS MORE CUMBERSOME. IT IN MANY AREAS WE HAVE NO ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. YEAH. I ISSUES JUST IS ALREADY SUFFERING FROM. A STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS THAT COULD SCRATCH THAT THREAT OF BUDGET CUTS HIGH WORKER TURNOVER. TABLE PAYROLL DELAYS COMPLICATED REGULATIONS DIRE POVERTY BOTH CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS IN THE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT PROCEDURE REQUIRED TO CORRECT TIME SHE ERRORS. TODAY OF A FEW. DON'T ADD ANOTHER LAYER OF POTENTIAL DYSFUNCTION WITHOUT FIRST FIXING CONSIDERED WRITING ISSUES AND PROBLEMS. EVGA WILL DIMINISH QUALITY OF CARE AND ADDED LATER OF REPORTING AND RED TAPE BE ROLLED OUT THROUGH OUT THE CHARACTER THE. THE COUNTRY AND NOT REALISTIC IN TERMS OF DR GUPTA BANDS OF THE WORK. PERSONAL CARE IS THE VARIABLE IT INTERPRETED AND NOT CONFINED TO THE HOLD AN AWFUL ARE. RFID INVOLVES WE'LL TALK MULTI TASK. FLEXIBLE FLEXIBILITY IS IT ESSENTIAL IN ORDER FOR CONSUMER DIRECTED CARE TO SUCCEED. CALIFORNIA'S ATTEMPT TO CONFORM TO THE FEDERAL MANDATE. IS TRYING TO FIT A ROUND PEG INTO A SQUARE HOLE. YEAH. YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT TRYING TO FIND WAYS FOR THE SEVEN PERCENT TO TO NOT BE. CONTINUE CUT DOWN THE ROAD THERE'S OTHERS SEEING STATE THIS STATE. NEEDS TO LOOK AT AND FIXING THE PROGRAM. EVENINGS WE HAD THIS STATE SHOULD NOT BE IMPLEMENTING. I THINK THAT. IT'S NOT FUNDED. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT MEANS TO BE EVERYBODY TO LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO MAKE THE PROGRAM I BETTER TAKE SUCCESSFUL FOR ITS CONSUMERS THINKING. THINK USUAL. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA A. WE JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT FOR A ROBUST THEY CALLED OUR PLAN AND IMPLEMENTATION DOES NOT THAT DOES NOT ALTER THE HOMES THAT. THANK YOU. OKAY SALABLE SHAPE YES GROUP OKAY OF. ALTHOUGH I I FEEL SAID THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT THE STATE HAS IMPLEMENTED. IS IS. IT'S SECOND THAT'S GOOD I THINK THAT. SINCE SEE SEE SEE I WENT AWAY AT THAT THE THAT I JUST ESTATE RESTORING THE CONSUMER. OF THAT I HAVE COMMITTEE WAS. DEMOLISH BASICALLY TAKEN OUT OF PLACE AND I THINK SINCE IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF PLACE AS CONSUMERS THEY WERE PART OF THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND COMMITTEE. OF. ARE FINDING WAYS TO TO WORK WITH THIS STATE RTV V. BUT I THINK IT'S SHOULD LARGE OF A PROCESS THAT THEY'VE IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW THERE'S TOO MANY CONSUMERS INVOLVED. TOWARD TO BE SUCCESSFUL I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT DOWN TO A SMALLER GROUP OF CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS SO THAT WE COULD REALLY LOOKING GET ANTICIPATED GRADING OF REALLY WORK AT. DO YOU THINK YOU. WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FIVE. HELLO AGAIN. I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE ALL AFTERNOON TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GO AND APPROACH THIS WITH YOU GUYS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MA'AM. CHRISTOPHER MORENO. DISTRICT FOR STANISLAUS COUNTY BEEN WITH U. DW'S. TWO THOUSAND TEN. I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOUR PERSONAL STORY BECAUSE IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT WE ARE. CALIFORNIANS AND WHEN WE'RE STRONG ARM BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE NEED LEADERS TO PAY ATTENTION. LIKE THE YOUNG MAN UP THERE IN THE BLUE. AND I LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING. BECAUSE. WE REPRESENT A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS THEN SOME STATES. OKAY. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS WERE BRINGING IN ALL LARA MORE MONEY THEN THOSE SAME STATES. THAT DON'T HAVE THAT POPULATION COMBINED. SO IF IT'S A MONEY ISSUE AND IT'S ABOUT TAKING THAT TAKEN A HIT. DON'T PAY TAXES. THE PRESIDENT DOES IT WE DON'T NEED TO PAY FEDERAL TAXES EITHER LET'S KEEP THAT MONEY AT HOME. AND LET'S LET'S FUND THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS THERE'S MONEY HERE SO DON'T TELL THESE PEOPLE THAT THERE'S NOT MONEY BOTH FIND IT.

MY NAME IS ADAM GREEN UT W.. I HAVE AN IDEA. FOR YOU. THAT MIGHT BE AN IDEA THAT THESE PEOPLE LIKE YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE. WHY DON'T WE CREATED NUMBER? KEEP ACCOUNTABILITY IF YOU FOLKS. AND OUR GOVERNMENT. HOW WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE THAT? YOU WANNA KEEP ACCOUNTABILITY ABBAS. I FIND THIS VERY INTERESTING. MY EMPLOYER FINAL DO MY WORK WILL KICK MY REAR END OUT THE HOUSE. BECAUSE THAT'S MY JOB I TOOK ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY. M. I TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY TO I LOVE WHAT I DO I LOVE THE FACT THAT I CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS PERSON.

AROUND THE COUNTRY I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING. FROM MANY TODAY. IS JUSTIFIED AS THE IMPLEMENTATION IS GONE IN THOSE. STATE SO I THINK THERE IS. SOME REAL CAUSE FOR CONCERN. HOW THOSE STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED BUT IMPORTANTLY IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK FOR LESSONS LEARNED ON THE DIRECTION THAT? THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE GOING. I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEPARTMENT FOR. THEIR EFFORTS AND I THINK THEY'RE THOUGHTFUL APPROACH. THAT THEY'VE UTILIZED THUS FAR BOTH IN REACHING OUT I THINK TO. PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS AS THEY'RE MOVING FOR BUT ALSO CANDIDLY I THINK COMING FORWARD WITH I I THINK SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT THEY'VE SUGGESTED ARE OFF THE TABLE THAT WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO REPLICATE. FROM THOSE OTHER STATES SO WE STAND READY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT. WITH THE. DEPARTMENT IN THE ADMINISTRATION. AS WE GO FORWARD ON. ON AND IMPLEMENTATION UNLESS THERE IS ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE THAT HAPPENS IN THE AND THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. MY NAME IS JOSEPH VERY AGAIN I WANTED TO. OUT OF COURSE OPPOSE EVEY V. FOR ALL THOSE. YOU KNOW DE HUMANIZING REASONS THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE. BE UP BEYOND BE A PRACTICE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT WHAT I WOULD ASK. BEAT BECAUSE OF BUDGETARY THING ON A STATUS OF FEDERAL THINGY. IF WE CAN HAVE SOME KIND OF CUT COST IMPACT ANALYSIS OF NONCOMPLIANCE I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THEIR FEET THEIR THEIR FINE SCHEDULE AND THAT AND THAT SORT. BUT EVEN NAM. IF YOU THINK ABOUT NOT JUST THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM. YOU KNOW OFF SAID IN THOSE THINGS. BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY. WHAT WHAT MAY HAPPEN FOR THOSE THAT WILL PROBABLY END ALLEY BE INSTITUTIONALIZED BECAUSE OF THIS? PROGRAM SO. MAYBE UNDERSTAND IN THE THE THE FULL. IMPACT OF THE COST MIGHT. GIVE US A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER OR NOT SITE IMPLEMENTATION SHOULD BE MOVED LOOKED AT ALL AND OF COURSE OBVIOUSLY IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT DOES HAVE TO HAPPEN. I WOULD I WOULD HOPE THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE CONSUMERS AT THE TABLE TO. MAKE SURE THAT PROCESS IS GUIDED THANK YOU. MY LEFT OUT OF THIS NUMBER AS MY IDEA RODRIGUEZ. WITH ARMY HARLEM SORT ES CHARITY.

DURING THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CARES ACT WHERE THIS COMES FROM. I'M EDUCATE ADVOCATE DEAD. I URGE. CONGRESS IN THE U. S. SENATE TO OPPOSE THE BELL. WE DIDN'T JUST LIKE THE I AGES AS ISSUES THERE'S OTHER ISSUES IN THAT PARTICULAR BELL. BUT AND WE ALSO BROUGHT TO LIGHT THAT I JUST AS EBV CONNECTION DURING THE TIME. THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY PRESIDENT OBAMA IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. I WANTED TO ALSO MENTION THE FACT THAT I HAVE CONCERNS THAT. IF THE STATE IMPLEMENTS I EVD. THAT THIS COULD BRING FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF LITIGATION AGAINST A STATE TO BE INCLUDED IN LITIGATION. I'M OVER EIGHTY EIGHT COMPLAINTS AMONG OTHER. AMONG AMONG OTHER PROTECTIONS FOR THE DISABLED. AND THE ELDERLY. AND ALSO I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT THAT. I THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO BE UTILIZING AN INDEPENDENT VENDOR. AS OPPOSED TO THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THE THAT THE EBT PROGRAM I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND I AM. ASKING THE QUESTION AS TO WHY THAT IS WHY IS THE DEPARTMENT. GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM AS OPPOSED TO AN INDEPENDENT. AYE VENDOR THAT MAY HAVE. THEIR OWN. AGENDA AT HAND. INCLUDING A PROFIT MARGIN. THANK YOU. HUMAN. SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENT I'LL BRING IT BACK UP HERE AND BEING THE ONLY ONE HERE. I WANT TO SAY THAT THE SUB COMMITTEE APPRECIATES THE COOPERATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES HAS HAD WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS ISSUE. AND THE STATED PRINCIPLES AROUND IMPLEMENTATION THAT THE DSS HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY PROTECTING. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS CAN BE LEVERAGED AS WE THINK. ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE V. V. WE ENCOURAGE AS WELL. AND AN ATTENTION TO THE POSSIBLE SUB POPULATIONS OF THE CASELOAD THAT MAY HAVE A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TIME COMPLYING WITH EBV FOR A HOST OF LEGITIMATE REASONS. WE KNOW THAT THIS DISCUSSION IS CONTINUING INTO THEM A REVISION AND HOLD THIS OPEN AT THIS TIME THANK. WITH THAT WE WILL RETURN TO ISSUE THREE GIVEN THE LATE HOUR. VERY QUICK SUMMARY AND IT WAS REALLY QUICK I WE SAW. A VERY QUICK ATHERTON EYES AND THAT HOUSING HOMELESSNESS AND CIVIL RIGHTS PRESHEAF AT CSI'S I'M SO JUST A QUICK UPDATE ON WHERE. WE ARE AYE WITH THE HOUSING DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM AND SO WE PUT OUT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS IN THE END OF JULY. WITH. END OF OCTOBER COUPLE MONTHS A COUPLE WEEKS I EXTENSION FOR SOME OF THE FIRE IMPACTED COUNTIES. BY GOT ALL OF THEM IN BY MADE ME AND NOVEMBER AND I'D SORT OF A DONE IN TWO ROUNDS OF THE BASE ALLOCATION. AYE WHICH WE FINALIZE OF THE FORTY ONE OF THE FORTY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. HAS GONE OUT TO THIRTY NINE COUNTIES ALSO WERE EXCITED ABOUT THAT THE LEVEL OF INTEREST WE GOT FROM A PRETTY BROAD SWATH AND. SO THAT WOULD NOT JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WERE IN THE MIDST OF GETTING THE LAST TWO POINT EIGHT. MILLION OUT A COMPETITIVE ALLOCATION ROUND SPLIT SORT OF AMONGST. OF THE HANDFUL OF MOST COMPETITIVE COUNTIES. AND HOPING TO HAVE THAT IDEALLY BY THE END OF OF MARCH EARLY APRIL AND WE'VE ALREADY BROUGHT THE COUNTIES SEEING NONE. CAN THE DEPARTMENT PLEASE RESPOND TO THE CONCERN RAISED BY LEGAL SERVICE ADVOCATES ON THE USE OF THE FUNDING SO FAR. YEAH SO JUST A QUICK CLARIFICATION ON THAT AND ANNA AND MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD THAT THE QUESTION IN TERMS OF HOW IT WAS RETARDED SO TELL ME IF I DID BUT. FOR I A ARE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO JUST BE GA THAT IS. SORT OF AN ALLOWABLE BENEFIT REIMBURSEMENT SO ANY RENTAL SUBSIDY THAT WE'RE GIVING IS ALLOWABLE FOR AYE A OUR. ALLOCATION AMOUNTS AND SO IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE AN INCREASE IN GI AT CAN BE. ANYTHING FROM MOTELS TO RENTAL SUBSIDIES SORT OF A WHOLE RANGE OF BENEFITS BOTH CASH AND IN KIND. THAT CAN BE I'M INCLUDED AND I ARE SO NOT OF THAT HELPS CLARIFY. THE QUESTION A BIT BUT IF I CAN PLEASE ASK THE DEPARTMENTS TO MEET WITH THE LEGAL SERVICE ADVOCATE TO ISCUSS THIS ISSUE IN MORE DEPTH THAT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED ABSOLUTELY. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE THREE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX AGAIN I BELIEVE MANY OF THESE ISSUES WERE ADDRESSED IN THE HANDOUT AND MAY OF BEEN SPOKEN TO BEFORE SO. IF WE CAN. DO OUR BEST. GOOD AFTERNOON NEW DELHI THOMPSON. WE KIND OF. HAD STARTED INTO AS YOU MENTIONED INTO A COUPLE OF THESE. I'LL JUST GO BACK TO THE POWER POINT. SLIDE EIGHT BEGAN THAT FLSA INFORMATION SO WITH IN THE AND I'M GONNA JUST. COME THROUGH THIS QUICKLY. IN THAT POWER POINT IT DOES PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATUS OF VIOLATIONS AND EXEMPTIONS THE TRANSITION. WITH THE EXCEPTIONS TO THE COUNTIES. GIVES A LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH PROCESSING OF OVERTIME IT STAYED PRETTY STABLE. ON THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS BEING PAID. OVERTIME OVERTIME AS WELL AS FOR TRAVEL TIME. THE NEXT SECTION GOES INTO. OTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS WHICH YOU MENTIONED. EARLIER AND JUST TO GO TO YOUR COMMENT AROUND EBV IT IS ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING. THAT WE ASK FOR IN THE ARE OF AYE AND THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE WHAT WE'VE DONE IN ETFS THAT HAS BEEN. WELL RECEIVED AND PEOPLE HAVE FELT HAVE GONE WELL AS A WAY TO LOOK AT LEVY FEES. YOU'LL SEE THAT WERE ALMOST UP TO. THIS IS ACTUALLY. FROM THE END OF DECEMBER SO. AS OF LAST WEEK WHERE UP TO CLOSE TO TWENTY PERCENT OF PROVIDERS USE THE UTILIZING EACH GAS NOW. TO SUBMIT THEIR TIME SHEETS WITHOUT GROWING EACH WEEK SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED ABOUT THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR UNION PARTNERS ARE COUNTY PARTNERS. TO OUTREACH TO FOLKS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO UTILIZE THAT IT DOES PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT AS FAR AS. TWO HOT BEING ABLE TO GET PAYMENTS OUT QUICKLY. ELIMINATES THE MAIL TIME ON THE FRONT END OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO USE DIRECT DEPOSIT ELIMINATES THE TIME ON THE BACK END. SO IT REALLY CAN GET PAYMENTS TO PEOPLE WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS AND THAT HAS BEEN A VERY POSITIVE POSITIVE OUTCOME AS WELL AS THE SYSTEM PROVIDES PROMISED INDIVIDUALS AROUND THE VIOLATIONS WE WERE MENTIONING. WITH. WITH C. FLSA IMPLEMENTATION TO ASSIST THEM IN BEING ABLE TO COMPLETE TIME SHEETS CORRECTLY AND NOT INCURRED IN VIOLATIONS. I. SEE. KIND OF MOVE THROUGH IT GIVES YOU A AND NUMBER OF PIECES OF DATA AROUND THE ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS. THE NEXT SECTION HAWKS ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PAID SICK TIME. SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING EXTENSIVELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THAT IMPLEMENTATION WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR JULY OF THIS YEAR. WE'VE HAD AN ACL COME OUT TALKING ABOUT HOW TIME WILL BE ACCRUED AND PROBABLY WHEN IT CAN BE USED. THAT NEXT PIECE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AND HAVE CONVENED A WORK GROUP TO TALK ABOUT THE BACKUP SYSTEM. FOR. INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEIR PROVIDERS ARE OUTSIDE. SO THAT'S GOING TO BE. ONGOING DISCUSSION. AND. THEN WE HIT EBV WHICH WE JUST FINISHED UP SORRY MISSED ONE PROVIDER ENROLLMENT. THAT A SEPARATE. TOP VIETNAM SEPARATE ISSUE. BUT I COVER NOW THERE'S A SEPARATE PROPOSAL HELP IF WE CAN JUST HOW PEOPLE TO HEAR. WITH THAT I THINK CRISTINA BUS HAMILTON IS. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR CRISTINA POSSIBLE TO WITH YOU W. APPS ME. WHO? SEVERAL ISSUES THAT I'D LIKE TO RAISE. FIRST OFF IS IT AND WE ASK THAT THIS BE AGENDA IS AN AND ARE VERY. THANKFUL THAT IT WAS A GEN DIS THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE SEVEN PERCENT CUT. THEY WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT RESTORING THE CUT ONCE AND FOR ALL AND AS WE ALL KNOW RIGHT NOW IT'S RESTORATION AND IS DEPENDENT ON. THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX BEING IN A FACT. WHICH IT DOES EXPIRE NEXT YEAR WE KNOW THAT WE NEED FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR THAT AND SO TAX TO CONTINUE. THE LA OLA ITSELF ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FEDERAL APPROVAL WAS UNCERTAIN AT THIS POINT. SO IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THEN THIS SEVEN PERCENT CUT AUTOMATICALLY GOES BACK INTO PLEASE AND. YOU KNOW THAT THAT COAT CAME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF THE RECESSION. AND AS OTHER. FOLKS HAVE TESTIFIED REGARDING OTHERS SERVICES AND BENEFITS ATTA AT A TIME WHERE THE GOVERNOR IS SEEKING TO PUT. THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE AMOUNT IN THE RAINY DAY FUND. IT IS NOT RIGHT TO BE DOING THAT WHEN THERE ARE SERVICES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN RESTORED GOING BACK TO THE RECESSION. AND THIS CUT NEEDS TO BE STRUCK FROM CURRENT LAW IN OUR OPINION. I. WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THIS NOW WHILE TIMES ARE GOOD AND NOT NEXT YEAR WHEN WE ARE IN A CRISIS MODE. SO WE WE DO OF WORK RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE ADOPT THAT. AND THEN SECONDLY ON PAID SICK LEAVE WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING IN WE FAR VERY LONG TO GET PAID SICK LEAVE FOR I JUST AS WORKERS. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE A COMPREHENSIVE BACK UP PROVIDER SYSTEM. IS NOT GOING TO BE PUT INTO PLACE IN EVERY COUNTY AND THE REASON I SAY THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY THAT THERE'S NOT. DESIRE FOR ONE TO GO INTO PLACE BY THE DEPARTMENT BUT WHAT APPEARS TO BE A LACK OF FUNDING. AND IF YOU SPEAK TO PEOPLE FROM THE COUNTIES AND MEAN THIS IS A JOINED EYES TO DATE COUNTY ADMIN COSTS AND CONCERNS ABOUT PUBLIC AUTHORITY FUNDING. THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY TO EXPECT THAT COUNTIES ARE GOING TO CREATE PROVIDER BACK UP SYSTEMS THAT DON'T CURRENTLY EXIST WITHOUT MONEY. DO IT AND YOU KNOW HAVING INTENT AND GOOD INTENTION IS GOOD BUT. WITHOUT THE DOLLARS ALLOCATED THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF A PROVIDER CALLS OUT SICK ANY CONSUMER DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER PROVIDER TO CALL. WHICH MAY OFTEN HAPPEN. THEN THAT PROVIDER PROBABLY WILL FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULDN'T CALL OUT SICK AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IS THAT CONSUMER WON'T HAVE ANOTHER PROVIDER WHERE THE CONSUMER WILL ACTUALLY HAVE NO PROVIDER AND. BE IN A VERY BAD SITUATION SO. A REAL PROVIDER BACKUP SYSTEM IS SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT ORIGINALLY WHEN S. B. THREE FIRST PASSED. TWO YEARS AGO AND. IT FELL OFF ON THE PAGE ALL OF LAST YEAR IN AND IT APPEARS THAT THERE'S JUST. RELUCTANCE TO FUND IT THIS BUT AGAIN WE WE THIS IS IT. THIS IS A BENEFIT BUT IT'S ONLY A BENEFIT THAT WILL BE TAKEN IF THERE'S SOMETHING EMPLOYEES FOR WHEN THAT WORKERS NOT ABLE TO WORK SO WE WE WE REQUEST FUNDING FOR THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF WE WANT. IF ANYONE WITH SCO YOU. WERE IN FULL SUPPORT OF A FULLY AND PERMANENTLY RESTORING THE SEVEN PERCENT ARE AGES AS PROVIDERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CONTINUOUSLY COME TO THE STATE AND ASK FOR SOMETHING THAT'S RIGHT BILLION DESERVEDLY THERE'S. AND SO WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL AND THANK YOU W. FOR BRING IN THE REQUEST FORWARD SECONDLY I AM I ALSO ECHO THE COMMENTS ON FOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM UT W.

TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE. DIRT DURING THE ANNUAL ASSESSMENTS TO SEE WHETHER THOSE PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE TO PROVIDE AN EXEMPTION WHICH MAY NOT BE RAISING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT. MAY APPLY FOR EXEMPTION. THANK YOU WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIX. CHAIRMAN A ARAMBULA AND A STALWART SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. LET'S GET REAL. IN JUNE AND JULY. PAUL RYAN IS GOING TO IMPLEMENT. HIS CARDS ONTO THE TABLE FOR CATASTROPHIC CUPS. TO OUR HEALTHCARE. PROGRAMS. IT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THIRTY PERCENT WE DON'T KNOW. AND WE NEED TO SEVEN PERCENT. CUT ELIMINATED THIS YEAR. BECAUSE FRANKLY IF WE DON'T. IT'LL BE A VEHICLE TO HELP IN THE CRISIS THAT COMING AND WILL HAPPEN IT'S NOT. IF IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN LIKE A YEAR AGO WITH THE ATTACK ON LIKELY WE STOPPED IT. ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE A PROGRAM FROM A HUNDRED PERCENT FACING THOSE CUTS NOT FROM NINETY THREE PERCENT. OF A PROGRAM. AND IT'S HELD OVERS EVERY YEAR IT'S KIND OF I MEAN WE HAVE TO COME AND ASK FOR THAT. IN TOES AND FINGERS THAT'S LIKE A FINGER AND A HALF. YOU KNOW AND. AND THE STATE IS GOING TO HAVE SERIOUS SIRIUS. BUDGET CRISIS. IN JUNE AND JULY WHEN THE. WHEN THE HOUSE DOES THIS AGAINST. OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT. WE NEED IT IT WE NEED TO START THE DISCUSSION WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT OF OUR PROGRAM. I CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT YEAR. AND EVEN IF SOMEHOW MIRACULOUSLY THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. IF THEY DECIDE THAT THIS IS A LOSER FOR THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. OF. THE ECONOMY'S COMING YOU KNOW A. GOOD THING SO LAST FOR EVER. AND THEY'LL BE MORE CONCERNED MAYBE WE CAN CUT SEVEN PERCENT. REMEMBER IT WAS UP ARBITRARY FIGURE THAT WAS PUT ON. US THE EIGHT SEVEN PERCENT BECAUSE IT WAS DONE LIKE. FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE SOMETHING THEN NUMBER. HE WAS EVEN BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF. WHERE WE HAD BEEN RECENTLY? SO I I'M SPEAKING AS A HOME CARE WORKER FROM SAN FRANCISCO. BUT ALSO OUR UNION SUPPORTS THAT THIS BE DONE THIS YEAR. ALSO WE NEED THE BACK UP FOR A THIS SMALL BENEFIT WE HAVE ONE DAY EIGHT HOURS A YEAR. YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY. WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT TAKING THAT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH TRIAGE AND STRETCHED OUT OVER THE DAYS I MEAN HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ONLY SICK FOR ONE DAY A YEAR. YOU KNOW TO TO DELAY. THE ABSOLUTE NECESSARY CARE THAT WE GIVE TO PEOPLE AND TRY TO SPREAD IT OUT AND GET OUR FRIENDS TO WORK FOR US BUT. YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN THERE THEY'RE BUSY TOO SO WE NEED THE BACKUP SYSTEM AS WELL. SO AS. FAR AS THE UNION AS FAR AS THE INDIVIDUAL I ASK YOU TO END. THIS CUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE RELYING ON THE GENERAL FUND AND. NOT THE M. CEO OF TAX OF. LISTS REMOVE THIS. CUT AND THIS THREAT OVER OUR HEADS THAT WE'VE LIVED WITH SINCE THE SCHWARZENEGGER YEARS THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA DEB ROTH'S DISBELIEVE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. HERE TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSALS THAT WERE JUST PRESENTED AND. IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE SEVEN PERCENT CUT IT IS LONG OVERDUE FOR IT TO BE RESTORED WITHOUT BEING DEPENDENT ON. SOME OTHER FINANCIAL OR POLICY DECISION MADE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SECONDLY. THE GENTLEMAN WHO JUST SPOKE. UNDERSCORED. THE THE SENSE OF CONCERN ABOUT. PAID BACK UP AND. HAVING IT AVAILABLE. BACK UP WAS IN ISSUE YEARS AGO WHEN I USED TO WORK ON AYE XSS AND THAT WAS BEFORE THERE WAS PAID SICK LEAVE OR ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT.

MY NAME'S AMY DAY I'M A PROUD MEMBER OF UNITED DOMESTIC WORKERS AND NOW ALSO AN ORGANIZER. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE PERSONAL SIDE OF THE SEVEN PERCENT HIGH AND WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED IT WAS AN EIGHT PERCENT SKY. THAT YOU'RE LATER WHEN WE CAME OUT OF THE RECESSION IT WAS RESTORED ONE PERCENT. WHICH WAS NOT FAIR. OF COURSE AS I SAID I CARE PROVIDERS BAND TOGETHER AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS COMPLETELY RESTORED I THINK IT SHOULD BE A NON ISSUE LIKE CRISTINA BASS HAMILTON EXPLAINED IT SHOULD JUST BE OUT OF LAW. WE SHOULDN'T BE SCRAMBLING TO TO FIND A PROGRAM THAT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY FUNDED ALREADY AND. FOLKS LIKE. THAT OUR FAMILY HOME CARE PROVIDERS AND YOU GUYS KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO THE WORK FOR FREE AND JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING GOD'S WORK DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD MAKE IT HARDER ON THEM TO DO SO. ARE REGISTRIES ARE OR EIGHTY. SUFFERING AND TWO OF THE COUNTIES THAT WE REPRESENT UP IN THE NORTHERN AREA OR OR EIGHTY I'M DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOME CARE PROVIDERS ON THOSE REGISTRIES AND OUR OR EIGHTY FOLKS WITH DISABILITIES GOING WITHOUT CARE. AND IF IF. WE DON'T FIND THE FUNDING I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE GETTING WHAT THEY NEED IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN WORSE AND TO TRY TO HOLD ON TO HOME CARE PROVIDERS. AND THERE OR DO YOU NOT MAKING A LIVABLE WAGE THERE OR EIGHTY SUFFERING SO MUCH TO DO GODS WORK I'M ASKING YOU GUYS TO REALLY SUPPORT HOME CARE WORKERS IN. AND ALSO THE CLIENTS THAT THEY TAKE CARE OF BY MAKING SURE THAT THE SEVEN PERCENT IS NOT AN ISSUE IN THE YEARS TO COME THANK YOU. BECAME.

AND ALL THE ROAD BUMPS THAT WE WE KEEP COMING ACROSS YOU KNOW LIKE THINGS LIKE THE SICK DAY YOU KNOW THEY FOUGHT REALLY HARD FOR A WE WERE. HOME CARE WORKERS WERE EXEMPT FROM IT. AND WITH THE SEVEN PERCENT CUT YOU KNOW LIKE IF BIG IF IT'S NOT IF IT IS REDUCE REESE.

THIS IS THIS HAS TO BE IMPORTANT THIS HOUSE TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE ALL SUPPORT AND THAT WE REALLY. WHEN MAKING THESE DECISIONS THEY HAVE TO. IT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY IT'S ABOUT THE WORK AND LIKE SHE SAID LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID BEFORE PEOPLE ARE GONNA DO IT ANYWAY. BUT THEY DESERVE THE DIGNITY DIGNITY AND RESPECT.

HELLO MY NAME IS CLARA KAUFMAN EL DORADO COUNTY U. D. W.. I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE SEVEN PERCENT. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND I EACH SS. YOU HAVE TO GET APPROVED FOR THESE HOURS THESE ARE HOURS THAT THE CLIENTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES. AND LIVE THEIR LIVES IN THEIR HOMES AND NOT IN AN INSTITUTION. SO YOU'RE TAKING AWAY HOURS THAT THEY NEED TO LIVE IN THEIR HOMES. IT'S NOT ABOUT. YOU KNOW PAYING THE WORKER SO MUCH AS THE CLIENTS NEEDING THE HOURS. SO IF THEY DON'T HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER THAT LIVES THERE. WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE CLIENT LIKE. THINK OF THESE CLIENTS YOU SEE A LOT OF THEM IN WHEELCHAIRS. OKAY YOU'RE TAKEN SEVEN PERCENT OF THE TIME THAT THEY NEED SOMEBODY. WHO'S GOING TO FILL THAT TIME WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WITH THAT TIME. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET FROM THEIR CHAIR TO THE BED? HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT HOW YOU WOULD GET FROM YOUR FROM A CHAIR IF YOU END UP THERE BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW WHAT TOMORROW IS GOING TO BRING. HOW WILL WE GET FROM A CHAIR TO THE BED? IN HAVE SOMEBODY IT YOU KNOW JUST SITTEN AT THE MEETING ROOM GO NOT KNOW SOME PERCENT GONE. YOU DON'T GET TO DO THAT THAT'S WHAT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK SO MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WE ELIMINATE GET INTO BED EVERY NIGHT. WHEN DOES IT WHEN DOES IT STOP. YOU KNOW THE DISABLED ARE THE ONES THAT ARE ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALWAYS THE ONES THAT GET IT THE WORST. WE ALWAYS GO FOR THE PEOPLE THE KIDS THE DISABLED YOU NO THEY DIDN'T THEY DON'T GIVE US MUCH OF A VOICE IN SOCIETY. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. YOU TAKE CARE OF THE LOWEST YOU BRING UP THE LOWEST. IT'S NOT ABOUT TRUMP IN IS YOU KNOW ONE PERCENT OF SOCIETY IN THREE PERCENT A SOCIETY WE KNOW BETTER THAN THAT WE ALL KNOW BETTER THAT WE ALL GREW UP. WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. GO BACK TO WHAT YOUR MOM TAUGHT YOU. I AM CHRISTIE'S FATHER BRIDGET AND I AGES AS PROVIDER AND I'M ON THE I JUST ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR SALMON AND YOU KNOW COUNTY. AND WITH EDUCATE ADVOCATE EMPOWER FAMILY CALIFORNIA I JUST WANTED TO SAY ON THIS POINT THAT WE WOULD ASK TO PERMANENTLY RESEND THE SEVEN PERCENT COTTON I JUST ASKS. AND THEN IF IT'S OKAY I'D LIKE TO SKIP TO MY PUBLIC COMMENT FOR ISSUE ELEVEN IT'S OKAY OKAY. I'M CURRENTLY IT CAN TAKE ANYWHERE FROM A FEW WEEKS TO MONTHS BEFORE ANYWAY AYE AGES AS PROVIDERS ARE ROLLED INTO THE PROGRAM AND NOW THEIR FIRST TIME SEE. THIS DELAY IS UNACCEPTABLE IT HAS SEVERELY IMPACTED THE ABILITY OF I JUST AS CONSUMERS. TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN NEW WORKERS HE MUST WAIT WEEKS OR MONTHS TO GET THEIR FIRST PAYCHECK. AND WE RESPECTFULLY URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE A MODEST APPROPRIATION TO EXPEDITE THE PROVIDER ENROLLMENT PROCESS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. SO THAT PROVIDERS ARE ENROLLED IMMEDIATELY ABLE TO TURN IN PAPERWORK IN A TIMELY ORIENTATION. PROVIDED A TIME SHEET AT THAT ORIENTATION DETERMINED AT THE END OF THE PAY PERIOD. AND PROVIDED A DEDICATED TELEPHONE ENROLLMENT LINE SO I JUST AS RECIPIENTS CAN SEAMLESSLY DESIGNATE THEIR PROVIDER. AND WE'VE TALKED A LOT OF. ADULTS. ON AYE AGE AS SASS THAT ARE ESPECIALLY THAT ARE DISABLED AND. THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY REALLY NEED AND SO I HOPE THAT SOMETHING THAT. YOU GUYS WILL CONSIDER THANK YOU THANK YOU. KRISTEN JOHNSON. OF HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF THEY TOOK SEVEN PERCENT OF YOUR MONEY. THANK YOU MA'AM. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. YOU KNOW I DO AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT THE PUBLIC HAS SAID AND. WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING OUR BEST AS WE'RE GOING FORWARD TO HELP TO ATTEMPT TO RESTORE. ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF. THE CURRENT FINANCIAL STATE OF OUR STATE. AND WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUES. WHEN YOU'RE READY. I DEBBIE THOMPSON DEPUTY THOUGH PROGRAMS. DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL IS LIKELY TO. ADDRESS. THE DETAILS ARE IN THE AGENDA I THINK IT. WELL BRINGS THAT UP. SO IF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE ONLY OVERSEEING COMMENTS ON ISSUES SEVEN. WE'RE JUST NOT THAT THE PROPOSAL IN PART REQUEST ADDITIONAL POSITIONS TO KIND OF LOOK AT. RESYNC GROWTH UNPAID HOURS PER CASE AND TRAIN A LINE THAT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S INDICATIVE OF INCREASED ACUITY WITHIN THE CASELOAD EXCITER. AND WITH THAT. JUST GIVEN THAT DATA ANALYSIS. WE WOULD THINK THAT THAT. THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL FOR THOSE REASONS MERITS FURTHER CONSIDERATION. THINK BERMAN FUNDS. BUT. WE SUPPORT A PROPOSAL OF. INCREASING RESOURCES TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANT THE COUNTIES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVEN. SEEING NONE WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SEVEN OPEN AND MOVE ON ISSUE A. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR FRANK MECCA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. APPRECIATE YOUR. THE GEN DIS IN THIS ISSUE THAT WE BROUGHT FORWARD. RELATED TO THAT SEEM AT SYSTEM THE COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT OUR WORKERS USED TO PROVIDE EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE TO CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS. IF THE SYSTEM WHERE WE DOCUMENT CONSUMERS NEEDS WE TRACK. A PROVIDERS WORK HISTORY AND BECAUSE OUR WORKERS ARE USING THE SYSTEM EVERYDAY. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT OFTEN IDENTIFY FIRST BUGS IN THE SYSTEM AS ANY SYSTEMS HAVE. OR IDEAS FOR IMPROVING HOW THE SYSTEM CAN BE MODIFIED. TO PROVIDE EVEN BETTER SERVICE FOR CLIENTS. THOSE IDEAS TURN INTO CHANGE REQUESTS THAT GET FORWARDED TO THE STATE. AND THERE IS A BUDGET FOR CHANGER QUEST THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE AND PRIORITIZES. THE CHANGE REQUEST THAT CAN BE ACCOMMODATED WITHIN THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS BUDGET. FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. THIS THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN ABOUT BECOME PROBLEMATIC FOR COUNTIES. THE FIRST IS THAT OFTEN COUNTY REQUESTS. I'M GET DEFERRED SORT OF MOVED. THE PRIORITY LIST. COMMENT BY DSS IN FAVOUR OF OTHER STATE PRIORITIES. YEAH SECOND ISSUE IS THAT COM THERE'VE BEEN INSTANCES LIKE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC A TRONIC ELECTRONIC TIMESHEETS WHERE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OVERTIME. WERE IN LIEU OF BUDGETING SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE CHANGES. THE STATE INSTEAD USES THE EXISTING POT OF MONEY. FOR CHANGER QUESTS TO IMPLEMENT NEW POLICY PROPOSALS WHICH WHICHWE BELIEVE IS AN APPROPRIATE. ARMED THE RESULT IS THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST FIFTEEN CHANGE REQUEST THERE SITTING IN THE QUEUE. I'M MORE THAT ARE BIG. WAITING TO BE ADDED TO THE QUEUE THAT'S A DECISION THAT THE DEPARTMENT GETS TO MAKE AND SOME OF THESE CHANGER QUESTS. ARE AS OLD AS THE SEEM AT TO SYSTEM ITSELF GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. THAT THIS MAY SOUND TECHIE. IT'S SORT OF. ARM. THIS IS THAT COMPUTER TECHNICAL ISSUE IT CAN'T REALLY MATTER BUT IT ACTUALLY REALLY DOES MATTER LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES. ONE CHANGE WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SPACE A SOCIAL WORKER HAS SO THEY CAN FULLY DOCUMENT THEIR ASSESSMENT OF HOW THE CONSUMERS ARE DOING. ANOTHER CHANGE WOULD ADD SPACE SO THAT WE COULD HAVE ADDITIONAL EMAILS. I AM AN ADDITIONAL PHONE LINES FOR PROVIDERS SO THAT IN A DISASTER RESPONSE. WERE BETTER ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION AT ONE EXAMPLE IS BEING ABLE TO ADD INFORMATION ABOUT AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SOME CLIENTS HAVE PEOPLE THAT CAN ACT ON THEIR BEHALF. SO THAT WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION IN THE SYSTEMIC CAN IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE INABILITY TO HAVE SORT OF A REASONABLE DEGREE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF. COUNTY DRIVEN CHANGE REQUESTS RESULTS AND MANUAL WORKAROUNDS INEFFICIENT TIME AND INCONSISTENT SERVICE FOR. TAPPER CLIENTS AND SO WE'RE REQUESTING THREE THINGS. THE FIRST IS AN ADDITIONAL ONE TIME PART OF. FUNDS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION A GENERAL FUND WHICH WHEN MATCHED UP WITH FEDERAL FUNDS. AND WE BELIEVE WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THE EXISTING BACKLOG. TO MAKE SURE THEIR BACKLOG DOESN'T MATERIALIZE AGAIN WERE REQUESTING THAT FIVE PERCENT OF THAT THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS BE DEDICATED FOR COUNTY GENERATED CHANGE REQUESTS. NUMBER ALSO ASKING FOR A POLICY WHEREBY WHEN SIGNIFICANT NEW POLICY CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE STATE. THAT WE APPROPRIATE THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO AUTOMATE THOSE CHANGES AND NOT USE A POT OF MONEY. THAT WAS NEVER INTENDED TO FUND THOSE DOES SIGNIFICANT NEW POLICY CHANGES. AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST. DIRECTOR LIKE ONE. OFF. ALWAYS STRUGGLED TO TRY TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE WITH MY FRIEND MISTER AMERICA. HOME IN THIS INSTANCE AYE AYE WHAT I'D SUGGEST IS THAT WE GO ON HAVING DIALOGUE WITH THE ASSOCIATION ON WHAT WE MAY PERHAPS A SOLUTION. AND WITH THAT FLOWS COMPLICATED WILL SIMPLY BE TO HAPPY ASSOCIATION REPRESENTED ON THE. CHANGE CONTROL MANAGEMENT PROCESS FOR SEE MAPS MUCHAS WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO HAVE TO STATE REPRESENTED ON THE SOLES. CHANGE MANAGEMENT BOARD. ELIOT IF I MIGHT IS NOT A BAD IDEA. ARM BUT IF THE COUNTIES ARE REPRESENTED ON A CHAIR ON THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT POLICY THAT HAPPENS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DECIDES NOT TO FUND THAT. DE AUTOMATION NECESSARY AND THEN THAT AND THEN WE USE AN EXISTING POT OF FUNDS THAT WAS NEVER INTENDED FOR EXAMPLE. SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THE SINCERITY AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION. TO DISCUSS GOVERNANCE I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A FISH AND. TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM OF THE BACKLOG. A LOON DEPARTMENT OF. YEAH YOU IF I IT'S I I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MAJOR POLICY CHANGES I DO PROVIDES. FUNDING FOR THOSE AUTOMATION. FOR EXAMPLE WE. DID THE. LATEST CHANGES WITH OVERTIME WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS SIR MONEY FOR CEMEX TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE CHANGES. SO I JUST MORE POINT OUT THAT WE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE. SUCH RESOURCES WE AND WE CAN THAT WE CAN DOCUMENT FOR YOU HOW THE QUEUE OF CHANGES THAT WERE IN THE HOPPER. GOT PUSHED OFTEN DELAYED WHEN THINGS USURPED THINGS BECAME A HIGHER PRIORITY THAT WERE THE FUNCTION OF POLICY CHANGES THAT THE STATE. BUT AGAIN I ALWAYS TRY TO STAY ON THE SAME PAGE OF MY FRIEND ON. IN TRUTH THERE'S A THROUGHPUT ISSUE WHICH IS THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH BANDWIDTH THAN WHEN THE. FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AROUND FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OCCURRED IT LITERALLY BLOCKED OUT THE SUN EVERYTHING ELSE THAT TO GIVE WAY FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION. IN OTHER POLICY CHANGES FRANKLY. THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINES SO IF. AS WE BECAUSE YOU THEIR PROPOSALS IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR POLICY CHANGES WE ALWAYS TRIED NOTE AND. ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE BUT AGAIN I MEAN THAT WE WILL CERTAINLY WORK WITH THE COUNTIES. BECAUSE THEY'RE A GOOD PATH. EARLIER INCOMES. JUST HAPPY TO PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE MEMBERS MAY HAVE AND LOOKING INTO THIS THANK YOU WILL NOT TAKE. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE A. STEP BROUGHT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL. JUSTIN YOU'RE A CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL ON THAT WILL HELP REDUCE THE BACKLOG OF COUNTY PARTIES FOR C. MIPS AND ALSO REDUCE THE LOCAL WORKAROUNDS THINK.

GOOD EVENING MEMBERS YES THAT'S CORRECT I'M ON NORRMALM ONLY LOT IS SO WITH THAT CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES FOR A TWO THOUSAND. AND I AM FILLING IN FOR CARRYING KIESLER WHO COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. AND I YOU HAVE A COPY OF OUR PROPOSAL ON PAGE THIRTY NINE. OF THE AGENDA. AND IT IS A REQUEST FOR SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC AT THE ORTIZ. COUPLE FILLED THEIR STATS STATUTORY MANDATES. AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW COUNTY I A TOUGH* AMMO <u><c.green>.</c></u> THIS RESULTED IN A SHORT FALL TO PUBLIC AUTHORITY ADMINISTRATIVE FINDING IN YOU CAN SEE THE. IN THE CHART THAT FOR FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THAT SHORTFALL WAS TWENTY SIX POINT ONE SIX PERCENT AND FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. OTHER SHORTFALL IS NINETEEN POINT EIGHT SEVEN PERCENT. THE IMPACT OF THIS SHORTFALL IN PUBLIC AUTHORITY ADMINISTRATIVE FINDING. HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT. SIGNIFICANT. ISSUES AT THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. PUBLIC AUTHORITIES HAVE HAD TO LAY OFF STAFF AND CURTAIL SERVICES UP MORE THAN ONE PUBLIC AUTHORITY HAS LOST HALF THEIR STAFF FOR EXAMPLE. IN SANTA BARBARA STAFFING HAS GONE DOWN FROM. TWELVE TO SIX AND TO IN THE RIVERSIDE PUBLIC AUTHORITY HAS HAD TO CUT THIRTY STAFF POSITION. SO THE SHORTFALL IN PUBLIC AUTHORITY FINDING HAS RESULTED IN PRO LONG TO PROVIDER ENROLLMENT TIMELY. DELAYED REGISTRY REFERRALS AND SLOWER RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS AND ROVIDERS AND THESE ARE DELAYS IN SERVICES TO THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES OUR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A BUDGET FORMULA TO ENSURE ADEQUATE AND SUSTAINED FUNDING FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. HOWEVER WE ARE REQUESTING SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR. WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO THIS BOOK? WE'RE HAVING ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND WE AS MADE COMMITTED TO DO AS WE ARE CONTINUING TO DO WITH THE I JUST US COUNTY FOUND. I MEN AS WELL AND WE ARE HAVING REGULAR MEETINGS TO. TRY AND EVALUATE EXACTLY WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF. OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES THANK YOU LA NO HAN FINANCE.

SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE NINE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE. THAT. DID ANYONE WITH THE ARE YOU I'M W. PCS PROVIDERS CARE FOR CONSUMERS THAT NEED ADDITIONAL PERSONAL CARE OURS BUT ESSENTIALLY PROVIDE THE SAME SERVICES AS I AGES AS PROVIDERS. SPECIFICALLY W. PCS PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET THE SAME PROVIDER REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ICE AGES THIS PROGRAM AND ARE PAID THE SAME HOURLY RATE AS I AGES AS PROVIDERS WITHIN THE SAME PAY ROAMING SYSTEM. THERE'S APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SIX HUNDRED WBCS PROVIDERS STATEWIDE SEVENTY PERCENT PROVIDE BOTH AYE AGES SAYS AND W. PCS SERVICES AND ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED PROVIDE. WBCS ONLY SERVICES. DESPITE THE SIMILARITIES AND WORKING. AND WORKING TERMS AND CONDITIONS W. PCS PROVIDERS ARE NOT AFFORDED THE SAME BENEFITS AS I AGES AS PROVIDERS SUCH AS HEALTHCARE AND LABOR REPRESENTATION. CURRENTLY W. PCS PROVIDERS ARE UNABLE TO RECEIVE HEALTH BENEFITS BECAUSE THEIR HOURS DON'T COUNT TOWARDS THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE. THIS PROPOSAL BRINGS PARITY BY ESTABLISHING THE PUBLIC RECORD ABOUT THAT THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY AT THE EMPLOYER OF RECORD FOR W. PCS PROVIDERS AND EXTENDS THE SAME BENEFITS TO WBCS PROVIDERS AS I JUST AS PROVIDERS. BY HAVING LABOR REPRESENTATION W. PCS PROVIDERS WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE WITH ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS FLSA THAT WAS DISCUSSED. A LITTLE BIT EARLIER IN THE AGENDA SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE PUBLIC ALREADY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT. AND WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY A MORE ACCURATE APPROPRIATION FOR THIS REQUEST AND WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU WHAT'S THE ADMINISTRATION'S RISK. OPPOSING. THANK YOU.

SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENT ON BRINGING UP THE DYESS I HAVE ONE QUESTION IF I CAN ASK THE ABSENT YES. HE WAS AGENDA IS AS AND PRESENTED AS THE ADVOCATES AS BEING INADVERTENTLY EXCLUDED I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TALK ABOUT THAT. SO WHY CAN'T SPEAK TO THE. THE HISTORY OF THE ORIGINAL BILL. HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN I JUST AS AND W. PCS FOR EXAMPLE I JUST HAS A STATE PLAN BENEFIT. W. PCS IS BUILT INTO TWO OF OUR HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE WAIVERS. THAT BOTH OF WHICH I'VE COME ON AT DIFFERENT TIMES. AND HAVE DIFFERENT RULES AND REQUIREMENTS AROUND HOW WE FUND THOSE THE SPLIT OF THOSE FOR EXAMPLE IS ONLY STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS VERSUS I JUST AS HIS. COUNTY STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS I'M SO THERE ARE DIFFERENCES AND BUT I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND CONSULT WITH MY COLLEAGUES REGARDING THE HISTORY SPECIFICALLY OF. THAT REFERENCE I'D APPRECIATE IT JUST TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE GOT INTO THIS. IN THE FIRST PLACE AND ANY INFORMATION YOU CAN PROVIDE OUR STAFF WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED OF COURSE WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE ELEVEN. IF ANYONE WITH THE CI YOU CALIFORNIA. ON BEHALF OF OUR THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND I AGES AS PROVIDERS WE REQUEST TO MAKE SMALL YET SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE PROVIDER ENROLLMENT PROCESS IN ORDER TO ON BOARD NEW PROVIDERS INTO THE SYSTEM AND INEFFICIENT AND EXPEDITED MANNER. WE I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE DEPARTMENT WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT WITH THEM. IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS OVER THIS PROPOSAL. AND SPECIFICALLY REQUEST FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN APPLYING TO BECOME AN AYE AGE ASSESSED PROVIDER RECEIVE THEIR ENROLLMENT PACKET WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS AND ENSURE PERSPECTIVE PROVIDERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE MANDATORY PROVIDER ORIENTATION WITHIN NO MORE THAN TWO WEEKS. ACCORDING TO EDIE DE THE STATE WILL NEED AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HOME CARE PROVIDERS BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO MEET THE DEMAND OF THE AGING POPULATION. CURRENTLY IT CAN TAKE ANYWHERE FROM A WEEK TO MONTHS. BEFORE PROVIDERS ARE IN WROTE CLEARED AND GIVEN THEIR FIRST TIME SHEETS THIS IS DEFINITELY THE CASE IN RURAL COUNTIES OFTENTIMES ARE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN HIRED BY CONSUMER THEY WILL BEGIN WORKING WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION EVEN IF ALL THE STEPS ARE NOT COMPLETED. SOMETIMES ON PROVIDER THAT'S HAVE TO WAIT TO GET APPROVAL THEY WILL SEEK OTHER EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES OF OPPORTUNITIES WHICH ONLY EXACERBATES THE NEED FOR MORE PROVIDERS IN THE SYSTEM. THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP GAIN AND RETAIN PROVIDERS IN THAT WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAX WILL HAVE CRISTINA VASANTHAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CRISTINA BOSS HAMILTON WITH YOU W.. COMPLETELY ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM ASCII YOU I I JUST WANT TO RAISE ONE EXAMPLE THIS IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY OUR FOLKS IN THE FIELD. A WE HAVE A PROVIDER HER NAME IS FIVE YEAR OLD LOW MEDINA THE MEDINA FROM KERN COUNTY. WHO ATTENDED A OR I AM SORELY MISSED OUR BACK CALL THE COUNTY TO APPLY? AND SUMMIT HER. APPLICATION TO BECOME A PROVIDER IN ON DECEMBER EIGHTH. WAS GIVEN AN APPOINTMENT FOR AN ORIENTATION ON DECEMBER TWENTIETH. SUBMITTED HER BACKGROUND CHECK MATERIAL ON JANUARY SECOND. AND RECEIVED A TIME SHE'D ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH. SO FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES FROM DECEMBER JANUARY HALFWAY THROUGH FEBRUARY THIS PER RIDER WAS WORKING. AND MIND YOU THIS IS GOT A TIME SHE ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH NOT GOT PAID ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH THEN IT WAS HOWEVER MUCH LONGER TO GET PAID. SO THIS IS A COMMON POLICE ISSUE THAT UNFORTUNATELY HASN'T BEEN RESOLVED BY THE ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS. AND. AYE I WISH THERE WAS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THIS I THINK THIS IS COMMON SENSE STUFF. SEND THEM AN APPLICATION WITHIN THREE DAYS AFTER THEY. YOU KNOW CALL. THE HAVE A ORIENTATION FOR THEM TO TEN WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF APPLYING I MEAN THIS IS COMMON SENSE STUFF THAT SHOULD ALREADY BE HAPPENING. BUT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS ISN'T AND SO WE NEED FUNDING PER OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO. ALLOW THIS TO OCCUR IN THIS WILL AT LEAST HELP WITH SOMEWHAT WITH THIS DELAY. THANK YOU. AFTER LIKE WHEN. THAT INTEL. I WE ALSO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO. SURE THAT PROVIDERS ARE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS IN AN EXPEDITIOUS WAY. OF ONE OF THE AREAS OF THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO WORKING ON IT CURRENTLY IS. THE POINT TIME WHEN SOMEONE BECOMES ELIGIBLE TO GET THEM AND IT CONNECTED TO THAT PARTICULAR CLIENT THEY'RE GOING TO WORK FOR WORK FOR AND TIME SHEETS ISSUED. AND WORLD. FIRST AREA WE'RE LOOKING AT BEING ABLE TO EXPEDITE THAT IS BY. ENHANCING OUR. I JUST US PORTAL THAT'S A PART OF THE ELECTRONIC TIME SHEET. SYSTEM. SO THAT RECIPIENTS COULD ACTUALLY ENROLL THEIR PROVIDERS DIRECTLY THROUGH THAT PORTAL SO WE CERTAINLY. I SHARE THE VALUE TO. I EXPEDITE THESE PROCESS. HELLO DEPARTMENT OF FUNDS. THE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE ELEVEN. GET BROUGHT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA CLIENTS NEED PROVIDERS PROVIDERS NEED TO GET PAID. YOU SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL. WE CAME. BRADLEY WE ADMIRE AYE TO SAYS WORKERS HAVEN'T CISCO I HAVE A WITNESS LIKE.

WITH THAT SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS. I'D LIKE TO GET THE DEPARTMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF THE ESTIMATED COST OF THE ADVOCATES PROPOSAL THAT THEY'VE TAG TO IT. IS IN THE BALLPARK FOR THE KINDS OF SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS AND. JUST TO GET AN ANALYSIS FROM THE DEPARTMENT. I JUST ANSWER ON THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THAT NUMBER YAK THEY'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE SPONSORS OF IT. GREAT.

REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE. I CAN GET GIVEN THE HOUR ALONG WITH. AYE WE DISTRIBUTED UP POWER POINT ON THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM OF WAR DEL GRAMMATICAL RUNS THE PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF THE CVS OURSELVES OUR LIAISON COUNTIES IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. OTHERWISE I THINK. TARA OR A GLASS OF THEIR MEMBERS. I GOT. YOU'RE GOING. THANKS FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK I HAD TONIGHT MY NAME IS ADAM ARE COOKIE SHOP AND I'M A PHYSICIAN AND A PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT UCSF AND I PRACTICE AT SOCCER BURKE SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL WHICH IS THE. PUBLIC HOSPITAL IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND I'M ALSO AN NIH FUNDED RESEARCHER WHO SPENT THE LAST TWENTY YEARS STUDYING AND HOMELESSNESS AND THE AFFECTS ON HOMELESSNESS ON HEALTH. AND THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION HAS ASKED ME TO PRESENT TODAY ON THE ISSUE OF ELDER HOMELESSNESS SAFE BY TO PROPOSE ON. I COME HERE TODAY TO EXPLAIN WHAT I'VE LEARNED TO MY TWO DECADES OF WORK AS A RESEARCHER AND PRACTICING CLINICIAN HAVE THE SAFETY NET HOSPITAL ON THE TOOL OF HOMELESSNESS AND OTHER ADULTS. AND TO SPEAK ABOUT THE URGENT NEED TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS IN THIS POPULATION. IN OUR RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT AMONG SINGLE ADULTS WHO ARE HOMELESS ABOUT HALF FOR OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY. ARE WORKING OAKLAND HAS SHOWN THAT AMONGST THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY FORTY FOUR PERCENT HAD NEVER EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS BEFORE THE AGE OF FIFTY. MANY OF THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN LEFT VULNERABLE BY ELLIS JOB LOSS LOSS OF A FAMILY MEMBER. OR OTHER ABUSE AND IT WAS THAT ABUSE PHYSICAL ABUSE FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION THAT LED DIRECTLY TO THEIR BECOMING HOMELESSNESS AS YOU WELL KNOW HOMELESSNESS IS A CRISIS LEVELS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT FOR EACH PERSON TO EXPERIENCE IT IT'S A PERSONAL CATASTROPHE A CATASTROPHE WITH DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY. TO END HOMELESSNESS WE NEED TO SHUT THE FRONT DOOR TO HOMELESSNESS WE NEED TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS BEFORE IT OCCURS IN THE FIRST PLACE. PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS IS LESS COSTLY IN EVERY WAY THEN RE HOUSING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BECOME HOMELESS. ARE SYSTEMS ARE NOT CURRENTLY WELL DESIGNED TO RESPOND PROACTIVELY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK OF LOSING HOUSING. BUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECTIFY THIS WITH HOME SAFE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES WORKERS ARE THE ONES WHO INTERACT WITH GLOBAL ALLDERS AT THIS PIVOTAL MOMENT OF CRISIS. AND THESE ARE THE CRISES THAT HAVE ACTED UPON PREVENT THAT RARE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY PREVENT HOMELESSNESS BEFORE IT OCCURS. WHATEVER STUDY PARTICIPANTS ARE COMMON T. IS A FIFTY SIX YEAR OLD MAN WITH LIFELONG DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY. HE WAS LIVING IN A LOW COST DEPARTMENT PAID FOR A BIAS DISABILITY BENEFITS THAT HE HAD BY VIRTUE OF BEING DELAYED. HE HAD NO FAMILY BUT HE HAD MET MANY PEOPLE THROUGH HIS CHURCH. THERE HE MET SOMEONE WHO OFFERED TO BE AND I SAY THIS IN QUOTES HIS PAY E.. THIS PAY E. TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD HELP MANAGE ITS BUDGET IF HE HANDED OVER HIS DISABILITY CHECKS. THE P. INSISTED. AND THAT T. COME EVERY DAY TO PICK UP SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT HE GAVE HIM TEN OR FIFTEEN DOLLARS AT A TIME. THE TRIP REQUIRE TEE TO TAKE SEVERAL BUSES AND THE MONEY HE PICKED UP HARDLY EVEN COVERED HIS BUS FARE. IT PAYING UNFORTUNATELY NEVER PAID HIS RENT. BECAUSE OF THIS HE FELL BEHIND AND WAS EVICTED WITH NO FAMILY OR SOCIAL SUPPORT HE BECAME HOMELESS AND AND RESORTED TO SLEEPING ON THE AC TRANSIT PASSES. HIS HEALTH DECLINED PRECIPITOUSLY AND HE LOST CONTACT WITH THOSE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HELP AGAINST THIS EXPLOITATION. WE KNOW THAT THEIR WELL KNOWN AND SEVERE CONSEQUENCES TO HOMELESSNESS AMONG OLDER ADULTS A RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT ADULTS FIFTEEN OLDER HAD HEALTH INDICATORS THINGS LIKE COGNITIVE PHYSICAL FUNCTION. THAT WERE WORSE THAN ADULTS TWENTY YEARS OLDER THAN THEM IN THE GENERAL POPULATION SO THEY MAY BE IN THEIR FIFTIES THEY REALLY WERE MORE LIKE PEOPLE IN THEIR SEVENTIES OR EIGHTIES IN TERMS OF THEIR HOUSE. HOMELESSNESS AGES PEOPLE IRAQ WHICH IS THEIR BODIES THEIR MINDS IN THEIR SPIRITS. AND WHEN OLDER ADULTS BECOME HOMELESS THE CAN NO LONGER ACCESS THEIR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND THEIR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND RELY INSTEAD ON EMERGENCY CARE. pOF THE OLDER ADULTS WE STUDIED HAD VISITED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND ELEVEN PERCENT HAD BEEN HOSPITALIZED FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. HOMELESSNESS IS CATASTROPHIC. TO HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND IT ALSO PREPARED TO TENCHI IT'S THE RISK OF VICTIMIZATION. AND OUR RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS SORT ENORMOUS RISK OF BEING VICTIMIZED WHILE THERE ARE HOMELESS BOTH PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE EXTRAORDINARILY COMMON. WE FOUND THAT THIS RISK IS CUT BY HALF IS SOON AS THEY BECOME REHOUSED. THEREFORE HOME SAFE WOULD ALLOW APS WORKERS NOT ONLY TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS BUT TO PREVENT FURTHER VICTIMIZATION AT A CRITICAL POINT. AS A PHYSICIAN I CAN SAY THAT THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT STEP I CAN TAKE FOR PATIENTS IS TO HELP THEM RETAIN THEIR HOUSING. THERE IS NO MEDICINE AS POWERFUL AS HOUSING. COMMITTEE MEMBERS I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THE ENORMOUS TOLL OF HOMELESSNESS AND OLDER ADULTS ON THEIR HOUSE IN ON THE COST. SOCIETY HOUSING IS THE BEST MEDICINE AND HOME SAFE IS A COMMON WAY TO COMMONSENSE WAY TO PREVENT THE DEVASTATION OF HOMELESSNESS AMONG FRAIL OLDER ADULTS. WE COULD TALK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK DR SHOW REALLY SAID IT ALL. YOU DON'T PROTECTIVE SERVICES WORKER IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO BE ABLE TO INTERVENE TO PREVENT THAT HOMELESSNESS. UNFORTUNATELY THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM AS IT WAS CREATED COUPLE OF DECADES AGO. NEVER ANTICIPATED THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WAS NEVER RESOURCES ARE BUILT. PROVIDE WORKERS WITH THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO. UP PAY UP BACK RENT OR A SECURITY DEPOSIT OR DO SOME HEAVY CLEANING UP THERE WAS A. HOARDING INCIDENT OR TED NEGOTIATE WITH LANDLORDS. AND SO. WE'RE ASKING FOR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR A THREE YEAR. GRANT PROGRAM COUNTIES WOULD HAVE TO MATCH IT DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR. AND IT'S IT'S MODELED AFTER TO PROGRAMS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE ACTUALLY CREATED IN THE PAST ONE IS THE CAL WORKS HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM. AND ONE IS THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM. THOSE ARE TWO INVESTMENTS WISE INVESTMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AGREED UPON. TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AMONGST CAO WORKS FAMILIES. AND TO FACILITATE THEIR REUNIFICATION OF FAMILIES IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM OR EXPERIENCING HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS. WE'RE BUILDING ON THE SUCCESSFUL MODELS. THE MODEL REQUIRES SO A COUNTY MATCH DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR SO THE COUNTY WILL HAVE AN INVESTMENT. YOUR SKIN IN THE GAME THE COUNTY WILL BE REQUIRED TO UTILIZE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT EXISTING RESOURCES SO THAT WE'RE NOT. SO THAT WE'RE NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL AND WE'RE CONVINCED THAT WE CAN PROVE NOT ONLY CAN WE SAVE LIVES AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO LIVE OUT. THAT THEIR SENIOR YEARS WITH MORE DIGNITY THAN THEY EVER WOULD HAVE IN THE ABSENCE OF HOME SAFE BUT THAT WE CAN SAVE THE TAXPAYERS. MONEY. AS WELL SO WE VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND URGENT CONSIDERATION OF THE. AFFIRMATIVE. WE'D LIKE TO THANK US IT EVERYDAY FOR REACHING OUT TO THE AND RESTORATION ON THIS PROPOSAL WHILE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LANGUAGE. WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE'D LIKE THAT PROPOSAL TO INCLUDE SPECIFIC DATA BY WHICH THE LEGISLATURE AND DEMONSTRATION COULD EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A PROGRAM AND CONSIDER IT AT ANY STATE OPERATION COSTS THE DEPARTMENT. UNIVERSALLY SKIPPED OVER DIRECTOR LIKE BORN TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE PRICE NO ALL I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY I WISH I'D THOUGHT OF IT. WITH THAT WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE TWELVE. JUSTIN YOU'RE A CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. THIS WILL HELP. I VICTIMS OF ELDER ABUSE WHO ARE BECOMING HOMELESS IT ADDRESSES A CRITICAL ISSUE WOULD ALLOW COUNTIES TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AMONG THIS VALUABLE POPULATION AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THINKING.
