IN IN IN OUR NATION IN

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.968
CALIFORNIA EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:24.069
WHICH GOES ALONG WITH THE FACT

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:25.704
THAT WE HAVE A VERY HIGH COST

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:28.040
OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. AS

PEOPLE CAN'T LIVE THEY NEED A

00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:52.631

THE CONSIDERATION THAT I HAD

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.239

THERE'S A LOT OF. LOW BUDGET

00:27:57.442 --> 00:27:59.210
WASTE TO PROMOTE THE PROGRAM TO

00:27:59.277 --> 00:28:00.178
PROMOTE ENROLLMENT IN THE

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:05.316

AND AGAIN I IN KNOWLEDGE EVEN

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.394
WORKING ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:17.295
IT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF THIS

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:18.563
WOULDN'T HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.699

FINISHING FOR. SPARTAN PRODUCTS

I MEAN EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT

00:28:38.716 --> 00:28:40.618
NAME FOR IT BUT THAT. THE POINT

00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:42.253
OF IT IS TO LET STUDENTS KNOW.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.522
THAT THEY CAN GET THROUGH IN

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:45.156

GRADUATION RATE WAS ELEVEN

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:54.699
PERCENT. ELEVEN PERCENT- AT THE

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:58.470
TIME THE SYSTEM WIDE GRADUATION

00:28:58.536 --> 00:28:59.137
RATE IN FOUR YEARS WAS 19%

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:01.406
TODAY THAT RATE IS OVER TWENTY

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:02.907
FIVE PERCENT. IT'S MORE THAN

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:04.542
DOUBLED IN FOUR YEARS THROUGH

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:05.577
THE GREAT LEADERSHIP AT YOUR

00:29:05.643 --> 00:29:08.613
CAMPUS THERE. AND THE AND THE

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.181
FACULTY IN THE UNIVERSITY. THE

STATE ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO FIVE

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.218
YEARS AGO STARTED PROVIDING

SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT FOR. THE

00:29:15.386 --> 00:29:16.855
CALPERS PROGRAM FOR THE

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:19.390
GRADUATION FOR EFFORTS AND WE

00:29:19.457 --> 00:29:20.191
HAVE THROUGH OUR BUDGET HAVE

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:22.160
BEEN PROVIDING TENS OF MILLIONS

00:29:22.227 --> 00:29:22.827
OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:24.295
SPECIFICALLY TO HELP CAMPUSES

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:26.197
LIKE YOURS AND OTHERS. TO

00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:27.732
PROMOTE THE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:30.068
THAT ENHANCE ADVISING. BUDGET

00:29:30.135 --> 00:29:31.302
TO MAKE IT WORK AND I HOPE THAT

00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:32.337
WE WILL CONTINUE THAT

00:29:32.403 --> 00:29:34.105
COMMITMENT. TO OUR BUDGET

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:35.106
PROCESS I KNOW THE GOVERNOR

00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:36.875
GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS ONCE AGAIN

00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:38.877
STEPPED UP AND SAID I WANT TO

00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:41.613
FUND THESE PROGRAMS AND HE HAS

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.748
PUT IN I THINK- THIS TWENTY

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:44.616
MILLION BUT IT'S A SIZABLE

00:29:44.682 --> 00:29:45.850
AMOUNT OF MONEY I THINK. WE'D

00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:49.254
LIKE IT TO BE MORE- AND- THE

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.188
CHALLENGE IN THE REASON THIS

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:51.556
BILL IT'S BEEN PUT BEFORE USE

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.691
THAT THE SYSTEMS DO A LOT OF

00:29:53.758 --> 00:29:54.959
GOOD THINGS AND YOUR- TWO

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:56.361
CAMPUSES IN PARTICULAR DOING

00:29:56.427 --> 00:29:58.363
EXTRAORDINARY WORK. BUT FOR

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:00.298
MANY CAMPUSES THEY'RE NOT. AND

00:30:00.365 --> 00:30:01.566
THE ENROLLMENT IN THE IN THE

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.368
PHOENICIAN FOR CAL POLICIES

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:06.304
INCREDIBLY LOW- AND SO THIS IS

00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:07.572
A BILL TO NUDGE THEM TO DO A

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:08.606
LITTLE BIT BETTER TO IMPROVE

00:30:08.673 --> 00:30:10.875
THAT. ENROLLMENT BY 5% EACH

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:12.410
YEAR. AND THEY CAN DO IT

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:14.546
THROUGH ADVERTISING THROUGH- IT

00:30:14.612 --> 00:30:15.380
YOU KNOW AND IN SOME OF THE

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:17.148
UNIVERSITIES TAKE SEVEN CLICKS

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:18.550
TO FIND THE CAL PROMISE PROGRAM

00:30:18.616 --> 00:30:21.119
ON THEIR WEBSITE. NOT ONE OR

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:23.621
TWO BUT BUT SEVEN. BOB

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:24.822
PROMOTING IT DURING ORIENTATION

00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:26.424
HAS A LOT TO THE INEXPENSIVE

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:28.893
WAYS JUST LET STUDENTS NOW. IF

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.394
THEY KNEW THEY COULD GET

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.962
THROUGH IN FOUR YEARS. THE

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:34.799
ENROLLMENT. IN THIS PROGRAM

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:35.433
WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.367
AND FIND DEFECT DOES TO SAID

00:30:36.434 --> 00:30:38.136
PAN POINTS. THE FOLKS OF THE

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:39.304
PROGRAM FROM THE BEGINNING WAS

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.972
UNDER REPRESENTED. AND I'M

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.373
PLEASED TO SAY THAT AFTER THREE

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.042
FULL YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION WE

00:30:44.108 --> 00:30:45.310
SEE THAT IS EXACTLY WHO IS

00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:47.579
BEING SERVED. AND SO THIS BILL

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:49.080
SIMPLY CONTINUES THE GREAT

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:50.114
EFFORT BY THE UNIVERSITY TO

00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:51.182
ADVANCE THAT I HOPE I'VE

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:52.350
ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. YOU

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:53.818
KNOW THEIR NO IT'S REASSURING

00:30:53.885 --> 00:30:55.620
AND SUPPORTIVE SO IN A CAME IN

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:57.855
SUPPORT OF BUT IT JUST WANTED

00:30:57.922 --> 00:30:59.090
TO HEAR THAT REASSURANCE IN

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:00.992
TERMS OF CONTINUING. THIS IS A

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:02.260
FIGHT AT THIS LEVEL FOR

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:03.561
WHATEVER NECESSARY FUNDING

00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:04.862
THERE IS TO MAKE SURE WE

00:31:04.929 --> 00:31:07.699
AREN'T. IT AT SOME POINT. SORT

00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:09.200
OF CREATE A PROGRAM AND THEN.

00:31:09.267 --> 00:31:10.702
UNINTENTIONAL UNINTENDED

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:12.604
CONSEQUENCES HAVING KIDS OUT TO

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.072
DRY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. A

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:15.240
LITTLE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:16.641
AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN MINDFUL

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:21.879
THAT PLEASE SEND YOUR COMMENTS-

00:31:21.946 --> 00:31:23.081
I ALSO IF I MAY UM. BUT IN A

00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:24.716
GET INTO THE WEB. SO THAT THAT

00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:26.618
SOME. WE JUST HARD THAN IT IS

00:31:26.684 --> 00:31:27.552
FOR PEOPLE TO GET TO THE- TO

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:28.987
LOCATE HOW TO GET A SENIOR TAX

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:31.923
EXEMPTION- BOUNCING AROUND FROM

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.225
WEBSITE TO WEBSITE- JUST TO

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:35.660
DEFEND THEMSELVES THE STATE A

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:36.794
LITTLE BITON THE GRIP FOR YOUR

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:38.263
GRADUATION RATE THEY BASICALLY

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:40.298
MOVED TO A FIVE YEAR. A

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:41.733
BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAM THERE

00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:44.035
BECAUSE BECAUSE UNIVERSITY

00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:45.303
ITSELF IS SO OVER SAID

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:48.139
SUBSCRIBE SO IMPACTED THAT IT'S

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:49.107
NOT POSSIBLE FOR STUDENTS TO

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:52.176
GET UP THE CLASSES THE NEED

00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:53.878
OVER A FOUR YEAR PROGRAM SO I

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.179
JUST I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FIVE

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:57.482
YOUR NUMBERS LOOK LIKE- AND I

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:58.650
CERTAINLY NOT SUGGESTING THIS

00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:00.385
PROGRAM SHOULD BE A FIVE YEAR

00:32:00.451 --> 00:32:03.421
PROGRAM I JUST WANTED TO SAY-

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:05.056
THAT- I KNOW THEY HAVE OTHER

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:07.992
ISSUES HERE THAT ARE.

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:09.861
CONSTRAINING THEIR ABILITY TO.

00:32:09.927 --> 00:32:10.928
A TO GET STUDENTS IN AND OUT

00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:13.131
OVER FOUR YEAR CYCLE. THANK YOU

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:14.866
THANK YOU VENTURE. THANK CENTER

00:32:14.932 --> 00:32:17.068
CORTESE ANY OTHER QUESTION YES

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:19.470
CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU I ALSO

00:32:19.537 --> 00:32:20.772
HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:23.041
SENATOR I VOTED ON YOUR LAST

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:24.075
PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:25.677
THINK IT'S BEEN AWESOME SO I

00:32:25.743 --> 00:32:27.912
JUST WANNA SAY. THAT SOMEBODY

00:32:27.979 --> 00:32:30.648
WHO DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE- QUITE

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.650
FRANKLY BECAUSE I COULDN'T AND

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:33.518
THE REASON WE COULDN'T I

00:32:33.584 --> 00:32:35.486
COULDN'T GO WAS BECAUSE WE WERE

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:36.454
FARMERS WE HAD LAND BUT NO

00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:38.556
MONEY. AND SO WE DISCUSS IT

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:40.258
DISQUALIFIED ME FOR ANY

00:32:40.325 --> 00:32:41.726
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR ANY OF

00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:43.127
THOSE TYPE OF PROGRAMS BECAUSE

00:32:43.194 --> 00:32:44.796
THE SYSTEM DIDN'T RECOGNIZE

00:32:44.862 --> 00:32:46.564
YOUR CASH IT RECOGNIZED YOUR-

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:49.434
ASSETS. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.469
I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND I

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:53.137
HAVE AND MY WIFE AND I HAVE

00:32:53.204 --> 00:32:54.339
BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO MAKE

00:32:54.405 --> 00:32:56.274
SURE THEY GO TO. A COLLEGE AND

00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:57.475
FROM DAY ONE WE TOLD HIM

00:32:57.542 --> 00:33:00.244
THEY'RE GONNA GO BECAUSE WE

00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:00.845
KNOW THE VALUE OF THAT. AND SO

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:02.814
AT THIS POINT I HAVE TWO SONS

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.283
ATTENDING CAL POLY SAN LUIS.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.585
AND IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:10.054
ALSO IS VERY IMPACTED SO I WISH

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:10.988
I WILL SHARE WITH YOU OUR

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:13.624
EXPERIENCE IN THE ARMY THIS IS

00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:16.194
THE QUESTION- THE PROBLEM WITH

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.062
GETTING OUT IN FOUR YEARS YOU

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:19.731
CAN'T GET SOME OF THOSE CLASSES

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:20.565
YOU HAVE TO HAVE BECAUSE ARE

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:22.300
IMPACTED. WHICH MEANS THAT

00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:23.201
THERE'S NO MORE ROOM IN THE

00:33:23.267 --> 00:33:25.136
CLASS SO WITH THIS PIECE OF

00:33:25.203 --> 00:33:27.105
LEGISLATION DISADVANTAGED THOSE

00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:29.240
KIDS THAT ARE IN THIS PROGRAM

00:33:29.307 --> 00:33:30.875
AND BUMP THEM OUT AND THEN

00:33:30.942 --> 00:33:32.377
THOSE IMPACTED CLASSES WILL

00:33:32.443 --> 00:33:34.612
STILL BE IMPACTED AND THEY

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:35.346
WON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY GET

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:37.615
THAT. THE CLASSES THEY NEED TO

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:39.317
GET THEIR DEGREE. SO I WANNA

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:40.184
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

00:33:40.251 --> 00:33:41.886
ADVANTAGE IN SOMEBODY TO TRY TO

00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:43.988
GET OUT FOR YEARS THE COST OF

00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:45.623
DISADVANTAGES SOMEBODY ELSE AND

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.458
I'LL JUST. SAY THAT THE BIGGEST

00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:49.761
CALL I MEAN WE JUST HAD THE

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:50.962
LAST BILL TALK ABOUT COST. COST

00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:52.730

YOUR QUESTION ON IMPACTION THIS

WAY- FIRST THE MAKE KNOWLEDGE

00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:31.402
THE POINT YOU JUST MADE WHICH

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:32.837
IS THE- THE COST TO THE-

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.138
STUDENT AND THEIR FAMILIES IS

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:36.307
THE COST OF LIVING- AND THAT

00:34:36.374 --> 00:34:37.575
WHEN YOU GO FROM A FOUR YEAR

00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:39.577
DEGREE TO A FIVE OR SIX YEAR

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:42.046
DEGREE. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

00:34:42.113 --> 00:34:42.647
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THOSE

00:34:42.713 --> 00:34:45.183
COSTS- AND EFFECT FOR MANY.

00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:47.952
STUDENTS TODAY. IN FACT TENS OF

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:49.220
THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS RIGHT NOW

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:51.222
IN CALIFORNIA. ARE INCURRING

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:52.890
THAT DEBT. AND THEY'RE NEVER

00:34:52.957 --> 00:34:54.392
GETTING A DEGREE. THINK ABOUT

00:34:54.459 --> 00:34:55.860
THAT TRAGEDY YOU KNOW SPENT A

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:58.096
LOT OF THE TIME BUT- THE FOCUS

00:34:58.162 --> 00:34:58.963
OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO MAKE SURE

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.032
THAT WE- DEAL WITH THAT. THAT

00:35:01.098 --> 00:35:02.333
THEY CAN GET THEIR PROGRESS

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.734
TOWARDS A DEGREE HERE'S AN

00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:06.437
INTERESTING FACTOID. ABOUT 90%

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:09.106
OF THE STUDENTS. AT THE CSU.

00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:10.708
THAT SAN LUIS OBISPO AND ALL

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:11.609
THE OTHER TWENTY THREE

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:15.480
CAMPUSES. THEY'RE TAKING A FULL

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:16.080
LOAD RIGHT NOW. BUT THEY CAN'T

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:18.516
THE CLASSES NECESSARILY. LEAN

00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:21.385
TOWARDS THAT DEGREE WHY IS THAT.

00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:23.421
SOME CASES IT'S IMPACTION BUT

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:24.722
IMPACTION COMES BECAUSE THE

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:25.790
CLASSES THAT THERE'S A

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:26.991
COMPACTION IS WITHIN THE DEGREE

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:27.892
PROGRAM AND THEN THERE'S

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:29.060
ABILITY TO GET A CLASS SO

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:31.028
THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

00:35:31.095 --> 00:35:31.529
I THINK YOU BROUGHT THEM

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:33.464
TOGETHER. BUT THE ABILITY TO

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:35.132
GET A CLASS IS A CENTRAL ISSUE

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.767
THAT THE THESE CAMPUSES HAVE

00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:39.237
STRUGGLED WITH. AND WHETHER

00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:40.671
IT'S A PRE REQUISITE THAT ONE

00:35:40.738 --> 00:35:42.106
HAS TO TAKE IN A CERTAIN ORDER

00:35:42.173 --> 00:35:43.608
TO GET TO A DEGREE WHICH I

00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:44.642
THINK IS A SPEND SOME OF THE

00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:46.644
DEGREE PROGRAMS THAT SALAS

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:48.613
OBISPO MUCH MORE CUTE. THE

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:50.181
CAMPUSES OF GOT TO RECOGNIZE

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:52.717
THAT DEMAND AND MEET IT. AND IF

00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:57.021
YOU'RE OFFERING COURSES- AND-

00:35:57.088 --> 00:36:00.591
YOU KNOW- INTERNATIONAL ART.

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:02.960
HISTORY AND NO ONE'S TAKING IT

00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:04.362
AND THEN YEAR COURSE IN

00:36:04.428 --> 00:36:06.564
ARCHITECTURE EVERYBODY'S TAKING

00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:08.366
IT YOU KIND OF STARTED JESTING.

00:36:08.432 --> 00:36:10.434
BUT TO MEET THAT DEMAND AND FOR

00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:11.435
MANY THE CAMPUSES THAT'S BEEN A

00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:13.070
STRUGGLE. THAT'S BEEN OF THAT'S

00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:14.739
BEEN A BIG BARRIER IS THE

00:36:14.805 --> 00:36:17.208
ABILITY TO SHIFT THE COURSES

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:18.976
OFFERED TO WHAT STUDENTS WANT

00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:20.311
SO AS I TALKED AT THE BEGINNING

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:21.345
THAT MOST STUDENTS ARE TAKING A

00:36:21.412 --> 00:36:23.548
FULL LOAD WIRES TO GET AT

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:25.349
FIFTEEN UNITS A SEMESTER. SO

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:26.584
WHY ARE THEY GETTING THROUGH

00:36:26.651 --> 00:36:27.518
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TAKING THE

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:29.253
RIGHT COURSES BECAUSE THE

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.054
COURSES THEY NEED ARE NOT

00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:32.189
AVAILABLE. AND SO THE PURPOSE

00:36:32.256 --> 00:36:33.157
OF THESE PROGRAMS LIKE CAL

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:35.092
PROMISE IS TO PROVIDE THAT

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:36.427
ENCOURAGEMENT THAT URGE THAT

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:38.462
PUSH TO MAKE CAMPUSES BE MORE

00:36:38.529 --> 00:36:40.264
RESPONSIVE. AND PART OF THE

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:41.766
CHALLENGE AND WHY THIS BILL

00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:42.800
THIS YEAR THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:43.834
ADVERTISING IT IS THE KIDS ARE

00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:45.636
GOING TO PUT THE MAN ON THEM TO

00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:47.238
MAKE THOSE COURSES AVAILABLE.

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:48.272
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE

00:36:48.339 --> 00:36:49.273
GOING TO NOT HAVE TO BE MORE

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.275
RESPONSIVE TO SO KIDS CAN GET

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.476
THOSE COURSES AND GET THROUGH

00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:54.679
LIKE YOUR SONS. AND SO IT'S ALL

00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:55.846
MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:57.114
TO ENCOURAGE THE CAMPUS TO BE

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:59.350
MORE RESPONSIVE AND TO GIVE THE

00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:00.885
KIDS THAT FOR YOUR TRACK THAT

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.119
WILL SAY THAN A HECK OF A LOT

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:03.054
OF MONEY AND GET THEM TO

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:09.260
DEGREE. WHICH. PROVIDES

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:10.628
ENORMOUS LIFETIME VALUE. BUT

00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:11.295
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

00:37:11.362 --> 00:37:13.230
CLARIFICATION AT SO WILL THE-

00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:15.366
WILL IT. BOB OTHER OTHER

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:16.701
STUDENTS THAT ARE PROBABLY

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:17.969
TAKING A FULL LOAD OUT BECAUSE

00:37:18.035 --> 00:37:19.070
WE'RE GOOD WE'RE DEBATE WHERE

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:20.271
SOMEBODY ACTUALLY SIGNS UP IN

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:21.539
THIS PROGRAM THAT'S- KIND OF

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:23.474
WHAT I WANTED TO GET AN ANSWER

00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:25.276
FOR. I DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL.

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:27.111
IF YOU HAVE A CAMPUS IT'S BEING

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:28.746
RESPONSIVE TO STUDENT DEMAND.

00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:30.081
WHICH IS IN MANY CASES IN SOME

00:37:30.147 --> 00:37:32.316
CASES NOT HAPPENING TODAY. I

00:37:32.383 --> 00:37:33.451
THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE MORE

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:35.019
COURSE OFFERINGS OPENED UP FOR

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.287
THE KIDS THAT WANT TO GET IT

00:37:36.354 --> 00:37:37.955
AND CAN'T IN ORDER TO STAY ON

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:39.090
THAT TRACK I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:41.158
GONNA- IT'S GOING TO ME THE

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:42.426
OTHER STUDENTS I MEAN I THINK

00:37:42.493 --> 00:37:43.394
IF YOU SEE A LOOK AT LOOK AT

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:44.695
THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:46.163
FOUR YEARS AGO THE- FOUR YEAR

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:48.265
GRADUATION RATE AT CSU WAS

00:37:48.332 --> 00:37:49.467
NINETEEN PERCENT. AND TODAY

00:37:49.533 --> 00:37:51.135
IT'S THIRTY AND I'VE SET A GOAL

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:53.304
OF BRINGING IT 240% BY TWENTY

00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:54.639
TWENTY FIVE. EVERYTHING IS

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:55.640
GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:57.174
MORE KIDS ARE GETTING THEIR

00:37:57.241 --> 00:37:58.142
COURSES AND MORE KIDS ARE

00:37:58.209 --> 00:37:59.844
GRADUATING. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.879
THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE SUCCESS

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:03.180
OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS THAT THE

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:05.750
PROVEN SUCCESS. MORE KIDS ARE

00:38:05.816 --> 00:38:07.351
GETTING THROUGH SO I THINK.

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:09.620
THAT IRAQ'S AT ISRAEL IS FAIR

00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:10.988
ENOUGH. BUT I THINK THAT THE

00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:12.823
OVERALL IT'S MAKING ENORMOUS

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.191
PROGRESS FOR OUR A BROADER

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.726
STUDENT BODY AND I THINK YOUR-

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:20.598
CHILDREN ALL. OF OUR CHILDREN.

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:21.165
WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT. WELL

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:22.066
I'M IN A THE MIDST OF FOR YOUR

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:22.733
BILL I THINK YOU MAKE A- ARGUE.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.269
I WOULD SAY- AS SOMEBODY WHO IS

00:38:25.336 --> 00:38:27.471
JUST. LETTING THIS RIGHT NOW

00:38:27.538 --> 00:38:29.407
ACTUALLY WITH MY SONS. AS THE

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:31.042
QUESTIONS YOU DON'T ASK THAT

00:38:31.108 --> 00:38:31.976
DON'T GET ANSWERED I MEAN WE

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:33.911
WENT TO THE- ORIENTATION FOR.

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:35.946
OUR OLDEST SON. A FEW YEARS

00:38:36.013 --> 00:38:37.982
BACK HE'S A JUNIOR. CAL POLY

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:39.283
AND IS WAS LIKE THE YOU KNOW

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.184
THEY SAY THAT IT'S A GREAT

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:41.452
COMMUNITY OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:43.087
LOVES ST LOUIS IT'S- YOU KNOW

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:44.221
CLOSE THE OCEAN IS BEAUTIFUL

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:45.556
AND- HE SAID YOU A LOT OF OUR

00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:47.024
KIDS. ARE FIVE YEARS AND SO

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:48.192
THAT SPURRED THE THOUGHT TO ME

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:49.794
OF THE CALL I'M THINKING ABOUT

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.795
THE COST MY SON'S THINKING

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:51.929
ABOUT A- FIVE YEAR SOUNDS GREAT

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:55.366
AS LONG AS HE'S NOT PAYING FOR

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:55.966
BUT HE IS PAINFUL FOR EXCEL.

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:57.168
THE WHY IS THAT DEALT WITH THE

00:38:57.234 --> 00:38:58.969
QUESTION IS WHY IS IT FIVE

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:00.471
YEARS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET.

00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:02.239
NOW REALIZING HE'S A JUNIOR AND

00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:03.574
HE NEEDS TO TAKE HE'S GOING TO

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:05.076
BE IT. IS TAKING CROPSCIENCE

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:06.711
AND HE HAS TO DO LABS I MEAN

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:07.411
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:08.612
HAVE TO DO WHICH IS REALLY

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:09.914
DIFFICULT NOW WITH. ZOOMING YOU

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.515
DON'T DO LABS VERY WELL IT WHEN

00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:13.551
YOU'RE- ZOOMING. OR IMPACT YOU

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:15.519
JUST DON'T DON'T. AND SO WE'RE

00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:16.620
CONCERNED THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:17.555
BE THAT ONE OF THOSE FAMILIES

00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:18.956
WITH AT FIVE YEARS WHICH IS

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.591
AND- ANOTHER YEAR OF. YOU KNOW

00:39:20.658 --> 00:39:22.493
UP. TO TWELVE DOLLARS A MONTH

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.895
FOR JUST RENT- SO. ALL SUPPORT

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:26.130
YOUR BILL TODAY I'M GONNA WATCH

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:27.465
AS I'M- I WANT TO BE HELPFUL I

00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:28.666
THINK THIS IS A- ON THE RIGHT.

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.868
YOUR TRACK RECORD WITH THE LAST

00:39:30.935 --> 00:39:31.802
PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:33.304
AWESOME. TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.039
WE'RE NOT. ADVANTAGE IN SOME

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:36.640
OVER OTHERS AND- BECAUSE ARE

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.609
ALL FACED WITH THE IMPACT

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:39.210
PROBLEM THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:42.179
IT AND I THINK WE NEED TO. PUSH

00:39:42.246 --> 00:39:44.415
ON OUR- ON THE EDUCATION OF THE

BUT I ALSO NOTED IN THE

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.529
ANALYSIS THAT. THAT THERE

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:08.398
ISN'T. THAT I GUESS THEY'RE

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:09.999

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:36.392

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:50.466
IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT- THAT IF

RIGHT ASSEMBLY MON SHE HAS

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:26.736
BELIEVE THAT THE RATE FOR

01:03:26.802 --> 01:03:29.972
INSTALLERS IS HIGHER THAN IT IS

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:31.274
FOR THREE AND FOUR YEARS OLD

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.608
OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL AND THAT

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:33.776
WAY WE CAN FOLLOW OUTSIDE

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:35.111
BECAUSE THIS IS AGAIN THIS BILL

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:35.778
WILL BE GOING TO ANOTHER

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:37.680
COMMITTEE FENCE SITTING ON AS

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:40.383
WELL SO WE CAN. WILL PUT A PIN

01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:41.851
ON THAT ONE. IF I MAY CENTER.

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:43.352
THIS MIGHT HELP ON THAT THE

01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:45.621
BILL INCREASES REIMBURSEMENT.

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:47.456
RATES ONLY FOR INFANTS THAT ARE

01:03:47.523 --> 01:03:49.292
BEING SERVED BY PRESCHOOL I

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:51.827
BELIEVE. OKAY ALL RIGHT. THE

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:53.696
DETACHED HELPFUL AND AGAIN

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:55.798
MAYBE WE CAN. DIG INTO A LITTLE

01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:57.033
MORE AS YOU MENTIONED OR SOME

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.034
OTHER BILLS OUT THERE AS WELL

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.602
ALL RIGHT. NOW PRE APPRECIATE

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:02.271
THAT- AND THEN THE OTHER.

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.674
QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT. IT'S

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.509
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND SO IN

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:09.946
TERMS OF- BURKE SWITCHING FROM-

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:12.148
DAY SERVE TO AND TO ENROLLMENT

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:13.316
IN TERMS OF PAIN AND I

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:14.617
UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW SO

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:16.285
THAT. YOU DO HAVE FAMILIES

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:18.254
WHERE. THERE NEED FOR CHILD

01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:20.389
CARE MAYBE MORE I WANT TO

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:22.191
SPREAD IS A GREAT WORD BUT WHEN

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:23.292
THEY ACTUALLY ACT SIDE ACCESS

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.560
IT GIVEN EIGHTY PERHAPS

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:26.362
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. AND SO

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:27.797
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT WE

01:04:27.863 --> 01:04:29.098
CAN DO BY ENROLLMENT I

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:30.366
CERTAINLY HEARD THE WITNESS AND

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:32.468
SUPPORT THAT WILL ALLOW THE

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:33.002
OPTION TAKING CARE OF MORE

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:35.538
CHILDREN. I DID JUST WANT TO

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:41.177
CLARIFY THAT WHEN IT COMES. IF

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:41.811
YOU'RE DOING IT BY IN ROME AND-

01:04:41.877 --> 01:04:43.713
SO AND ROLL. LOCATOR ONLY

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:45.181
ACCESS IT YOU KNOW A HALF TIME

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:48.217
OR SOMETHING. DOES DAN THIS IS

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:49.085
THE CHILD CARE PROVIDER

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:51.654
REQUIRED TO THE VAN YES I MEAN

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.757
DO THEY JUST THAT TO TAKE ON.

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:55.858
SOME MORE DAYS WITH ANOTHER

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:57.793
CHILD OR DO THEY JUST KEEP THE

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.128
MONEY AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE X.

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:00.663
NUMBER ROMAN EVEN THOUGH SOME

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:01.864
OF THE PEOPLE AND ROLLED ARE

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:03.833
ONLY USING A PORTION. FOR

01:05:03.899 --> 01:05:05.935
WHATEVER REASON SO WHICH I TALK

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:07.903
CLEAR FOR HOW THAT WORKS OUT SO

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:09.071
YOU SIT IS ACTUALLY THE

01:05:09.138 --> 01:05:11.240
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ON MORE

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:13.042
CHILDREN BECAUSE SOMEONE MAY

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:15.077
NOT BE USING IT FULL TIME OR

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:16.078
ONLY USING PORTIONS OF TIME

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:19.448
BUT- HOW DOES THAT SORT ITSELF

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:20.916
OUT BUT- YEAH. YES THIS IS

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:23.085
ACTUALLY. A FORMULA THAT THE

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:25.988
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND USE IT

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:28.057
IN ORDER TO BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:29.825
ALSO GUIDELINES IN TERMS OF

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:32.161
RATIOS. FOR ALL OF THIS RIGHT

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:34.830
AND SO THEY HAVE TO. UNDERSTAND

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:36.365
IF SOMEONE IS ENROLLED FULL

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:38.434
TIME OR PART TIME. AND WHAT

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:39.669
THAT LOOKS LIKE TO BE IN

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:41.304
COMPLIANCE WITH THE RATIOS SO

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:44.073
BOTH PART TIME AND FULL TIME-

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.841
ARE POSSIBLE. AND THERE ARE A

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:48.277
REALITY NOW AND- THAT WILL

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:49.578
CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE BUT IT

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:51.347
DOES ALSO HAVE TO ALIGN WITH

01:05:51.414 --> 01:05:53.382
THE RATIOS THAT. ARE

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:54.583
APPROPRIATE AND WE'RE NOT

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:55.918
DEALING WITH RATIOS IN THIS

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:57.887
BILL OKAY NOT IT'D AND DEAD BE

01:05:57.953 --> 01:05:59.121
INTERESTED IN. HEARING MORE

01:05:59.188 --> 01:06:01.824
DETAILS PERHAPS AFTERWARDS- IT

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:03.392
IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU POINTED OUT

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:04.360
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:06.595
HAVE A FAMILY FAMILY THAT HAS

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:08.097
YOUR CHILD AND YOUR CHILD CARE.

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:09.265
STATE YOU'LL FOR WHATEVER

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:11.500
CIRCUMSTANCES- NEEDED A WORK

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:12.535
SCHEDULE MAYBE THEIR SOCIAL

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:14.303
SITUATION. THEY'RE NOT USING IT

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:15.171
ALL THE TIME YOU HAVE TO

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:16.272
MAINTAIN A CERTAIN RATIO SO

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:17.073
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN JUST

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.207
AUTOMATICALLY TAKE ON ANOTHER

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:19.208
CHILD BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:20.476
WHAT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AT

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:21.977
CETERA ND THEN SO HOW DOES THE

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:23.579
MONEY END UP. YOU KNOW HOW THE

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:25.081
MONEY FLOW CHANGES WITH THIS

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:26.549
PARTICULAR BILLS ONE TRYING TO

01:06:26.615 --> 01:06:28.317
AND BETTER UNDERSTAND. SINCE

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:29.985
WE'RE MOVING TO ENROLLMENT.

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:32.521
VERSUS SO- IT DIDN'T DEAL IT'S

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:34.357
GOOD AND IT'S- I'M NOT SAYING

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:35.624
THAT'S A NEGATIVE CHANGE I

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:37.360
THINK IT PROBABLY IS BUT ALSO

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:39.061
IN TERMS OF. INCREASING ACCESS

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:40.963
TO CHILD CARE AND CREATING MORE

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:42.064
ACCESS WHICH IS ONE OF THE

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:43.833
THINGS YOU KNOW YOURSUPPORTERS

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:44.967
ADVOCATE YES SAYING THAT THIS

01:06:45.034 --> 01:06:46.402
WOULD CREATE. LIKE TO KNOW

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:48.404
EXACTLY HOW THAT OPERATIONALLY

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:50.172
WOULD WORK AND WE CAN PERHAPS-

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.907
BUT DISCUSS. THAT AFTER THIS

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:53.609
BILL PASSES AS IT'S MOVING

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:54.610

YOU AND BEFORE I ASK YOU TO

CLOSE SAN RAMON I THINK MY

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:03.285
UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL IS

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:05.254
THAT. THE PROVIDER WOULD KEEP

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.356
THE MONEY AND THE SLOT WOULD

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:08.858
STAY THERE SO THAT THE CHILD

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.926
WOULD HAVE ACCESS I BELIEVE

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:12.795
IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID-

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.797
DURING THE PANDEMIC WHERE.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.665
SOMEBODY CHILD CARE CENTERS

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:24.273
LOST ENROLLMENT- BUT WE KNEW

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.207

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:14.602
LITTLE GOOD WHEN EITHER SIDE

NOT HAVE THE TECHNICAL

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.068
DIFFERENT EXAMPLES THAT ARE OUT

CONCERNED ABOUT NOT ORDINARILY

01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:22.416
THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS GET

01:30:22.483 --> 01:30:23.818
WORKED OUT SOMEHOW. FINANCIALLY

01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:27.088
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD BE

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:29.357
IN PLACE TO HELP CUSHION THOSE

01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:29.991
DISTRICTS THAT ARE RUNNING ON A

01:30:30.057 --> 01:30:32.827

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:34.962
CORTESE FOR THAT QUESTION. BOB

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:37.665
FIRST. I THINK IT'S SAD THAT

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:39.066
EVERY SCHOOL AGE CHILD

01:30:39.133 --> 01:30:39.901
CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE A

01:30:39.967 --> 01:30:41.803
LIBRARY CARD I THINK IT'S VERY

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:42.904
SAID THAT THE LIBRARY

01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:44.872
ASSOCIATION WOULD BE OPPOSED

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:48.009
TO. HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:49.710
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR WHOMEVER

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:51.412
ELSE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:54.649
EDUCATING YOUNG PEOPLE. SO I

01:30:54.715 --> 01:30:55.616
THINK THE COSTS HAVE BEEN

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:57.885
GREATLY EXAGGERATED- THIS

01:30:57.952 --> 01:31:01.022
DOESN'T REQUIRE. A DETAILED.

01:31:01.088 --> 01:31:02.623

01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:04.692
AN UNDERSTANDING. ALTHOUGH

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:06.794
WRITTEN BETWEEN BOTH THE SCHOOL

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:09.163
DISTRICT AS WELL AS AS WELL AS

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:11.432
A LIBRARY SYSTEM. IT'S NOT THAT

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:13.968
HARD IT'S REALLY NOT THAT HARD-

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:15.403
TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY NEED TO

01:31:15.469 --> 01:31:17.038
TAKE AN HOUR A DAY AT THE

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:19.073
LIBRARY TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.775
ALLOW SCHOOL CHILDREN TO COME

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:23.477

BIT MUCH BOB. IF THERE IS A

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.348

THAT CORRECT ABSOLUTELY OKAY SO

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:59.867
THIS IS FORCING EVERY LIBRARY

01:38:59.933 --> 01:39:01.869
EVERY SCHOOL TO COMPLY WITH

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:03.037

01:39:15.883 --> 01:39:17.818
MATERIALS AT A LOCAL LIBRARY

01:39:17.885 --> 01:39:19.653

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:21.155
VERY YEARS WHAT'S WHAT'S

01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:22.222
CREATING THE NEED FOR THIS

01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:23.857

YOUR QUESTION YES THERE ARE

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:36.737
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LIBRARIES

01:39:36.804 --> 01:39:38.472
THAT HAVE NOT COME TOGETHER AND

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:40.007
US THERE ARE CHILDREN WHO DON'T

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:41.475
HAVE ACCESS TO LIBRARIES AS

01:39:41.542 --> 01:39:43.377
THEY SHOULD- FOR WHATEVER

01:39:43.444 --> 01:39:44.778
REASON BECAUSE OF A LANGUAGE

01:39:44.845 --> 01:39:46.480
BARRIER OR BECAUSE OF FOR

01:39:46.547 --> 01:39:48.215
EXAMPLE A SOME SORT OF A

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:49.383
CULTURAL BARRIER IN MY OWN

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:51.852
AREA- ESPECIALLY ACUTE DURING

01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:53.687
THE PANDEMIC IS HIS ACCESS TO

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:56.390
THE INTERNET MOST CHILDREN IN

01:39:56.457 --> 01:39:57.858
MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN

01:39:57.925 --> 01:39:58.525
GIVEN THE HARDWARE BUT

01:39:58.592 --> 01:39:59.993
SOMETIMES THE INTERNET.

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.062
CONNECTIVITY DOESN'T EXIST IT

01:40:02.129 --> 01:40:04.365
DOES EXIST IN LIBRARIES AND SO

01:40:04.431 --> 01:40:05.766
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE MAKE IT A

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:06.967
PRIORITY WE HAVE TO FUND THAT

01:40:07.034 --> 01:40:09.503
PRIORITY- OF MAKING SURE THAT

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:14.508
EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA. HAS

01:40:14.575 --> 01:40:15.109

01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:19.213
AND THAT WE SHOULD APPROPRIATE.

01:40:19.279 --> 01:40:20.414

01:44:13.513 --> 01:44:15.048
CHALLENGE AND WE ALL KNOW THAT.

EXPECTATIVA FORTY WHERE WE HAVE

01:44:26.226 --> 01:44:29.262

THOSE- RULE COMMUNITIES. AND WE

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:41.408
HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL EVEN

01:44:41.475 --> 01:44:42.542
THOUGH WE'VE FUNDED IS IT

01:44:42.609 --> 01:44:45.779
HASN'T REALLY ENDED UP THERE IN

01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:47.147
OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR- HOSPITALS

01:44:47.214 --> 01:44:49.349
IN THE IN THE LIBRARIES. WITH

01:44:49.416 --> 01:44:52.452
THAT BEING SAID- I HAVE ELEVEN

01:44:52.519 --> 01:44:54.688
COUNTIES AND I HAVE THE LARGEST

01:44:54.755 --> 01:44:56.790
SCHOOL DISTRICTS GEOGRAPHIC

01:44:56.857 --> 01:44:59.993
WISE IN THE STATE AND MANY OF

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:03.497
THESE SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE ACCESS

01:45:03.563 --> 01:45:05.132
TO CLOSE LIBRARIES OR MAYBE ONE

01:45:05.198 --> 01:45:07.000
OF THE COUNTY SEAT SO FOR

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:09.302
EXAMPLE. BEAVERS SEVENTY FIVE

01:45:09.369 --> 01:45:10.537
MILES FROM THE COUNTY SEAT

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:11.505
THERE'S A LIBRARY THERE WE DO

01:45:11.571 --> 01:45:13.106
HAVE A LIBRARY IN OUR

01:45:13.173 --> 01:45:15.542
COMMUNITY- BUT IS STAFFED BY

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:17.244
VOLUNTEERS RIGHT ACROSS THE

01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:17.944
STREET FROM THE SCHOOL THE

01:45:18.011 --> 01:45:19.546

STUDENTS DO I DID WHEN I WAS

01:45:22.249 --> 01:45:25.018
THERE- BUT TO MANDATE THE

01:45:25.085 --> 01:45:26.920
SCHOOL HOW WOULD IT WORK OUT

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:28.088
WHAT WHAT'S YOUR VISION FOR

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:30.123
THIS. IN THESE VERY RULE

01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:31.558
COMMUNITIES WHERE IN MANY CASES

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:33.860
THERE IS NO LIBRARY EXCEPT FOR

01:45:33.927 --> 01:45:36.863
IF THERE IS ONE IT MAY BE-

01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:38.465
LITERALLY. OVER FIFTY MILES

01:45:38.532 --> 01:45:43.570
AWAY. SENATE DOLLY I WOULD

01:45:43.637 --> 01:45:45.138
EXPECT IF THERE'S NO LIBRARY

01:45:45.205 --> 01:45:48.008
WITHIN FIFTY MILE RADIUS THAT-

01:45:48.075 --> 01:45:49.810
IN TERMS OF THE PARENTS

01:45:49.876 --> 01:45:51.712
INTEREST IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:45:51.778 --> 01:45:53.714
INTERESTED IN PROVIDING SOME

01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:56.083
SORT OF ACCESS THAT THEY WOULD

01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:57.551
WORK IT OUT WHERE ONE WOULD

01:45:57.617 --> 01:45:59.686
HAVE A CARD AND PEOPLE WANT TO

01:45:59.753 --> 01:46:00.954
TRAVEL THAT FIFTY MILES THEY

01:46:01.021 --> 01:46:02.956
THEY CAN DO SO OBVIOUSLY

01:46:03.023 --> 01:46:03.990
DOESN'T REQUIRE THIS DEVILISH

01:46:04.057 --> 01:46:05.625
MINIMAL LIBRARY JUST PROVIDES

01:46:05.692 --> 01:46:07.694
THAT. IF A LIBER EXISTED THAT

01:46:07.761 --> 01:46:10.197
SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE

01:46:10.263 --> 01:46:12.466
ACCESS TO LIVE LIBRARY. AUGUST

01:46:12.532 --> 01:46:13.533
I'M NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTING

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.335
YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK IF WE

01:46:15.402 --> 01:46:15.902
REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING

01:46:15.969 --> 01:46:18.438
THAT HELPS. STUDENTS GET A

01:46:18.505 --> 01:46:19.673
LIBRARIES WE WOULD HELP FUND

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:20.874
LIBRARY SO THAT THEY'RE

01:46:20.941 --> 01:46:22.275
ACTUALLY AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS

01:46:22.342 --> 01:46:24.244
TO GO TO IN IN MY CASE IRAN ARE

01:46:24.311 --> 01:46:26.646
COUNTIES CASES- I CAN TELL YOU

01:46:26.713 --> 01:46:28.381
THERE'S VERY LITTLE ACCESS-

01:46:28.448 --> 01:46:29.816
JUST BECAUSE THERE'S REAP

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:32.319
REALLY A LACK OF FUNDING. AND

01:46:32.385 --> 01:46:32.886
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THAT SO

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:34.654
THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER

01:46:34.721 --> 01:46:36.523

01:46:37.958 --> 01:46:39.693
COUPLE COMMON TO MY OWN. FIRST

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:41.361
I WOULD SAY I WOULD BE HARD

01:46:41.428 --> 01:46:42.729
PRESSED TO FIND SOMEONE WHO

01:46:42.796 --> 01:46:43.530
LOVES LIBRARIES MORE THAN

01:46:43.597 --> 01:46:45.532
IDEAL. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL

01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:46.767
I GOT TO GO MY FIRST TIME IN

01:46:46.833 --> 01:46:48.301
KINDERGARTEN AND I WENT ALL

01:46:48.368 --> 01:46:49.870
THROUGHOUT MY- GRAMMAR SCHOOL

01:46:49.936 --> 01:46:51.238
AND HIGH SCHOOL YEARS AND I

01:46:51.304 --> 01:46:52.339
ALWAYS FELT LIKE IT WAS SUCH A

01:46:52.405 --> 01:46:53.907
PRIVILEGE. TO GET TO GO AND

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:55.642
CHECK OUT A BOOK OR MY PARENTS

01:46:55.709 --> 01:46:57.110
COULDN'T AFFORD ENCYCLOPEDIAS

01:46:57.177 --> 01:46:59.012
AT THE TIME- WE NOW USE THE

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:01.081
INTERNET. AND TO GET TO GO AND

01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:03.884
USE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA'S- FOR ME

01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:05.452

SO WHEN I SAW YOUR BILL I WAS

01:47:06.386 --> 01:47:08.188
VERY EXCITED. BUT THEN WHEN I

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:08.989
SAW THAT THE LIBRARY

01:47:09.055 --> 01:47:11.291
ASSOCIATION WAS IN OPPOSITION I

01:47:11.358 --> 01:47:13.126
THOUGHT. THIS KIND OF RAISES A

01:47:13.193 --> 01:47:15.428
RED FLAG FOR ME. AND I THINK

01:47:15.495 --> 01:47:18.064
THE ISSUE IS THAT I KNOW

01:47:18.131 --> 01:47:19.533
