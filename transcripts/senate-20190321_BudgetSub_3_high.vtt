THE DIRECTION THAT WE GIVE THE

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:07.026
PLANS ON HOW TO DO --

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:08.794
THE TIMELY ACTS AT THE SURVEYS --

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.162
AND EACH TIME AS I SAID IT GETS

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:11.931
BETTER AND BETTER SO --

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:13.099
WE'RE LEARNING A LOT ALONG THIS

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:14.733
PROCESS WE'VE WE'VE MADE A LOT

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.001
OF EFFICIENCIES IN THE WHOLE

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:17.136
PROCESS OF COLLECTING THE DATA

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:18.938
AND OUR OUR TASK NOW IS TO COME

00:12:19.004 --> 00:12:20.439
UP WITH WHAT IS A REASONABLE

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:23.476
RATE OF COMPLIANCE THAT WE CAN --

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:24.677
THAT THE PLANTS CAN UNDERSTAND

00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:27.480
THAT IT'S AND THAT WE CAN-ENFORCE AGAINST AND WHEN I TALK

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:28.314
ABOUT IN FORCE NINETEEN

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.548
ENFORCING IN A COURT OF LAW

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:31.383
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE. TO

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.185
PROVE THAT THE PLANS HAVE DONE

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:36.055
SOMETHING I'M SAID THAT.

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:37.756
SO THAT IS OUR CHARGE THIS YEAR

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:39.758
WE NEED TO HAVE A REGULATION --

00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:40.726
BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND WE

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:42.394
WERE WORKING ON DRAFTING THAT --

00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:43.696
WE'VE INVOLVED A LOT OF

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:45.531
STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS PROCESS --

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.399
A LOT OF FEEDBACK AND INTACT OR

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:49.268
SOME AT INDEPENDENT ACTIVITIES

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:51.237
GOING ON TO HELP ADVISE US ABOUT

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:52.872
WHAT THAT METHODOLOGY SHOULD BE --

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:54.840
AND SO WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:56.175
TO MEET OUR TIME FRAMES AND

00:12:56.242 --> 00:12:59.178
EXPECT TO HAVE A REGULATION

00:12:59.245 --> 00:12:59.778
READY TO GO AT THE END OF THE

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:00.746
YEAR.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:01.680
AND BUT IN TERMS YOUR APPROACH

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:03.182

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THAT YOU'VE

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:12.324
TAKEN IN THE PAST --

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:14.560
WHAT DO YOU SEE IS BEING THE

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.595
MOST RAPID WAY TO GET I MEAN

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:18.764
ULTIMATELY LETS US I MEAN WE CAN

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:19.965
AND THEN YOU NEED TO DO THIS YOU

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:21.233
KNOW WE HAVE FINES AND OTHER

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.169
TYPES OF?

00:13:23.235 --> 00:13:25.271
PUNISHMENTS FOR PEOPLE DOWN --

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:26.772
WHAT'S THE BUT HE SEES THE BEST

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:29.208
WAY TO MORE RAPIDLY BE SURE THAT.

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:32.011
HEALTH PLANS ARE IN COMPLIANCE

00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:34.079
AND AND ULTIMATELY THE PATIENTS

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:35.347
ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET THE

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:37.049
CARE THEY NEED TO ARE THERE

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:38.450
OTHER TOOLS THAT YOU SEE NOW

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:39.318
WE'VE TALKED A PROVIDER

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:41.420
DIRECTORIES AND CONSIDER HOW TO

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.455
CONSOLIDATE THOSE AND OTHER

00:13:43.522 --> 00:13:44.356
TYPES OF APPROACHES.

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:47.893
ORDER TO WORK AT THINGS YOU'RE

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.363
LOOKING AT SHOULD YOU HAVE TO GO

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.431
TAKE THEM TO COURT AND THAT'S

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.266
ALWAYS TAKE SOMETIME TO HAVE

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:55.768
SOMETHING COME OUT SO OFTEN

00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:56.001
TRYING.

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:56.602
WE'RE TRYING TO CHECK ALWAYS

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:57.770
PLAYING CATCH UP IN THAT REGARD

00:13:57.836 --> 00:14:00.105
BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT OTHER TYPES

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:02.141
OF APPROACHES MIGHT TAKE --

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:04.276
TO GET THE PLANS TO THAT MEANS

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:05.711
BETTER I I PREFER OF THE I'LL

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:09.481
JUST FOLLOW THE RULE AND WE'D

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:11.684
HAVE TO PUSH ANYBODY SAID.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.952
OKAY SO IN NOT THROUGH OUR

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:14.320
ANNUAL NETWORK REVIEW PROCESS --

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:15.287
WE DO LOOK AT THAT THE CAPACITY

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:16.188
OF THE NETWORK OVERALL AND

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:17.856
REALLY BUT THE TIMELY ACCESS --

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:19.391
PROCESS IS MEASURING IS IS THE

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:21.293
NETWORK AS A WHOLE ADEQUATE TO

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.062
SERVE THE ENROLLEES AND IT'S NOT

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:24.663
JUST ABOUT A SPECIFIC PROVIDERS

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.431
OFFICE.

00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:26.298
SO --

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:27.099
BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:28.701
BE TIMES WHEN A PROVIDER ISN'T

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:30.536
AVAILABLE YET BECAUSE OF YOU

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.238
KNOW POPULARITY OR CERTAIN KIND

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:34.306
OF SPECIALTIES WHATEVER SO AS WE

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:36.275
LOOK AT THE NETWORK'S OVERALL

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:37.042
WE'RE MEASURING UNLIKE HOW

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:38.077
WHAT'S THE CAPACITY OF THE

00:14:38.143 --> 00:14:40.512
NETWORK TO BE ABLE --

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:41.947
TO INSURE THAT TIMELY ACCESS SO

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:43.649
THAT'S ONE THING --

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.317
AND WHEN OUR SURVEYS TEAM GO OUT

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:47.052
AND LOOK AT THE PLANS PROCESSES

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:48.087
FOR HOW THEY EVALUATE NETWORKS

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:49.622
THAT'S ANOTHER AREA THAT WE WE

00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:52.458
ALSO LOOK AT AND SO AS I SAID IN

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:53.859
OUR REAL GOAL IS TO GET TO A

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:55.961
STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGY AND

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:57.196
RATE OF COMPLIANCE THAT.

00:14:57.263 --> 00:15:01.300
IS UNIFORM AND WE CAN REALLY

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:02.701
ENFORCE AGAINST.

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:04.069
ALL RIGHT SO IN USE WE'RE

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:07.239
TALKING ABOUT TRY EXPAND AND

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:09.275

WON'T BE SURE ON THE PRIVATE

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.186
SIDE THAT THAT --

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:22.388
PEOPLE ARE PURCHASING THROUGH

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:23.455

SPECIALLY DRUGS.

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:00.719
WHICH NOT SURPRISINGLY ARE THE

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:03.188
MOST EXPENSIVE --

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:04.723
THE REPRESENT ACTUALLY OVER HALF.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.357
OF THOSE IT ONLY REPRESENT WHAT

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:06.892
ONE POINT 6% OF THE

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:10.195
PRESCRIPTIONS AND THEN EACH

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:11.430
TRIED DEL THE IDEA OPTING TO

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:13.532
DELVE IN THAT LITTLE DEEPER AND

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:17.169
SEE HOW --

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:19.371
WHAT TO TO THAT ONE POINT 6%

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:20.406
ISN'T?

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:22.341
THAT WHAT THEY COME FROM YEAH

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:23.909
THE DATE OF THE TIMES TO THE

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.110
DEPARTMENT ISN'T ENOUGH I THE

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:26.111
PATIENTS ARE NON IDENTICAL

00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:26.779
PATIENTS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:29.048

NO WE HAD JUST HAVE VOLUME OKAY

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:32.985
SO BY PLAN HOW MANY

00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:34.486
PRESCRIPTIONS WERE FILLED OKAY --

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:35.487
AND THEN THE PER COST PER

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:36.355
PRESCRIPTION COST AND SO WE CAN

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:38.290
AGGREGATE THAT AND LOOK ACROSS

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:39.825
PLANS AND UNDERSTAND.

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.794
HOW MUCH BOTH WAS SPENT AND HOW

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.961
MANY PEOPLE RECEIVED ABOUT

ON THE SPECIALTY TEAR WHICH ARE

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:55.974
THE ONES ARE IN THE TOP

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:56.275
[inaudible]

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:58.243
TWENTY FIVE ALL RIGHT.

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:16.128
MEAN AS YOU KNOW THE THE

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:17.963
GOVERNOR HAS AN INITIATIVE

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.531
RELATED TO PRESCRIPTION DRUG

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.500
COSTS AND I'D AND AS A MEMBER OF

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:22.801
THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACEUTICAL

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:23.635
COLLABORATIVE.

00:18:23.702 --> 00:18:25.471
NOW WE ARE CONSIDERING BOTH OF

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:26.905
THE INFORMATION OUR REPORT THE

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:27.873
INFORMATION IN THE CALIFORNIA

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.441
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE REPORT

00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:31.443
AS WELL AS PRESCRIPTION DRUG

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.811
INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM OTHER

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:34.379
STATE PURCHASERS ON DIFFERENT

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:35.414
WAYS AT THE MINISTRATION CAN

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:37.149
APPROACH A REDUCING PRESCRIPTION

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:39.084
DRUG COSTS SO I THINK IT IS.

00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:40.486
USEFUL INFORMATION FOR MANY

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:41.887
PARTIES THEN I GUESS THE OTHER

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:42.521
FINAL QUESTION ABOUT IT

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:44.156
CERTAINLY ON ONE LEVEL OF COURSE

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:46.225
WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:48.861
PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS --

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:51.363
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE AND THIS

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.733
IS MY LESS SO WITH THE SPECIALLY

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.034
DRUGS BUT ALSO THE HOUSE THAT

00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:57.903
MATCH UP WITH SUPPLY --

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.539
SO WHERE YOU MIGHT BE SHORTAGES --

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:01.940
YEAH I THINK MY CONCERN IS IS

00:19:02.007 --> 00:19:02.708
THAT SOMETIMES --

00:19:02.774 --> 00:19:03.909
WELL CERTAINLY WERE CONCERNED

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.979
ABOUT HOW THERE MAY BE.

00:19:07.045 --> 00:19:08.580
CERTAIN PHARMACEUTICALS WHERE

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:10.148
THE COST IS GUNS ARE THE PRICES

00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:12.284
GOTTEN SO LOW YOU BASICALLY NOW

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:13.952
BOIL DOWN TO A SINGLE SUPPLIER.

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:14.853
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS THAT

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.890
SUPPLIER BECOMES A TARGET OF THE

00:19:17.956 --> 00:19:19.424
HEDGE FUND SOME INVESTORS

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:22.461
SOMEONE WHO SEES AN OPPORTUNITY.

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:23.395
TO THAT SWOOP AND BUY A CHEAP

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:24.329
JACK THE PRICE UP TO MAKE A

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:25.197
QUICK BUCK.

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:27.866
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK

00:19:27.933 --> 00:19:29.868
AT INTO THE PRICING INFORMATION

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:32.037
IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO LOOKING AT

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:34.106
WHERE MIGHT BE VULNERABILITIES

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:35.207
AND LOOKING AT WHERE WE MAY HAVE

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:36.441
SHORTAGES AS WELL ALSO WE CAN

00:19:36.508 --> 00:19:37.943
GET RELIABLE SUPPLY OF THE

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:38.644
MEDICATION.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:39.878
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN AS

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:41.547
WELL SO HOPING WE CAN LOOK AT

00:19:41.613 --> 00:19:44.249
BOTH OF THOSE AND BECAUSE IN THE

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:46.251
END WHAT WE WANNA DO IS HAVE?

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:47.452
YOU KNOW --

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.388
MEDICATION THAT SET THE BILL

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:50.322
WITH THE RIGHT PRICE.

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:52.224
AT ALSO AVAILABLE WHEN YOU NEED

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:52.691
IT RIGHT --

00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:54.693
SO IF THERE'S A PROBLEM EITHER

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.362
SIDE AND THERE'S THAT AND THEN

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:59.164
PEOPLE ARE BEING SERVED WELL.

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:01.767
ABSOLUTELY SO OKAY AND THEY

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:03.001
REALIZE THAT THAT FLIES BY BID

00:20:03.068 --> 00:20:04.069
OUT THE SCOPE OF YOUR AGENCY BUT

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:04.570
I'M THINKING THAT THIS

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:05.737
INFORMATION MIGHT BE USEFUL

00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:09.007
THINKING ABOUT WHICH AGENCY

00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:11.510
WHERE THAT MIGHT BE --

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:13.512
THEY MY MY LOOK AT THAT AND I'LL

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:16.114
ABSOLUTELY OKAY ALL RIGHT.

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:17.683
YEAH YES AS THEIR STONE THANK

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:18.650

THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION.

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:24.423
COUPLE QUESTIONS A ABILITY TO

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:26.024
HAVE AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF

00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:27.492
PHYSICIANS --

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:28.794
WITHIN THEIR PLANS ARE YOU

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.430
SEEING OKAY SEE ANY SHORTAGES

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:33.131
ANNIE ANNIE ABILITIES --

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:34.499
TO NOT PROVIDE SERVICE AND

00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:35.334
SPECIALLY AND MAYBE SOME OF THE

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.935
MORE RURAL AREAS.

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:38.236
I THINK YOU KNOW EVERYBODY YOU

00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:39.171
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A

00:20:39.237 --> 00:20:40.606
PROVIDER SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA

00:20:40.672 --> 00:20:42.174
AND IT IS MORE ACUTE IN RURAL

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.709
AREAS -- AND

00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:45.377
THAT'S WHY THE DEPARTMENT HAS A

00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:46.411
PROCESS --

00:20:46.478 --> 00:20:47.879
FOR APPROVING ALTERNATE ACCESS

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:49.615
STANDARDS IF THERE ARE AREAS

00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:51.216
WHERE THE THE TIME AND DISTANCE

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:52.484
STANDARDS AREN'T.

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:53.919
ABLE TO BE MET BECAUSE THERE

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:54.886
JUST AREN'T THE PHYSICIANS THERE

00:20:54.953 --> 00:20:56.521
SO -- THAT'S

00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:58.256
ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE LOOK

00:20:58.323 --> 00:21:00.359
AT WE DO A LOT OF VERY DETAIL

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:02.060
GEO DEAL MAPPING ANALYSIS OF

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:03.228
WHERE PROVIDERS ARE AND WHERE

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:05.330
THE MEMBERS ARE AND HOW WE CAN

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:06.198
BEST --

00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:08.133
MATCH THEM UP AND ALSO THE PLANS

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.401
ARE UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:10.769
PROVIDE MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:12.604
SO IF THERE IS IF THERE ISN'T A

00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:14.306
SPECIALIST IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:14.840
THAT THE SO MANY TO SEE.

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:15.841
ANY TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN GET

00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:17.509
THEM TO A PLACE WHERE THAT THAT

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:19.211
PERSON AS OKAY THAT'S COMFORTING

00:21:19.277 --> 00:21:19.878

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:22.147

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:41.900
IN COMPARISON TO THE REBATES UP

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:42.768
AND WHICH RECEIVED THE

00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:43.802

SPECIFICALLY COSTS ASSOCIATED

00:21:51.209 --> 00:21:52.144
WITH THE PDM.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.378
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IT'S

00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:54.579
REFLECTED IN WHATEVER THE

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.548
NEGOTIATED PRICE IS NOT

00:21:56.615 --> 00:21:58.617
SEPARATELY FROM SO IT'S YOU

PRICE PLUS THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.288

00:36:28.286 --> 00:36:30.187
INSURANCE RATE COULD START TO

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:35.593
CREEP BACK UP. 213% AND TWENTY

TWENTY THREE PRIMARILY AS A

00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:40.998
RESULT OF THE ACA INDIVIDUAL

00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:43.601
MANDATE PENALTY GOING AWAY --

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:45.336
WE PROJECTS THAT THE BIGGEST A

00:36:45.403 --> 00:36:48.439
FAX OF NOT HAVING A FEDERAL

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:54.211

00:36:57.748 --> 00:37:05.389
THE WE PROJECTS THAT BY. 202314%.

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:07.558
FEWER PEOPLE COULD BE ENROLLED

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:08.626
IN THE CALIFORNIA INDIVIDUAL

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:10.361
MARKET AND LEFT THE STATE TAKES

00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:11.862
FURTHER ACTION.

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:13.564
AND THAT SOLELY DUE TO THE

00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:15.299
ELIMINATION OF THE PENALTY WE

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:16.867
CAN ALSO SEE LOWER MEDI CAL

00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:18.369
ENROLLMENTS --

00:37:18.436 --> 00:37:20.805
EVEN THOUGH IT PEOPLE WITH MEDIC

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:22.707
HOLLER GENERALLY EXEMPT FROM

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:24.642
PAYING THE FEDERAL PENALTY OR

00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:25.376
WHERE EXEMPTS.

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:30.314
THE MANY OF THEM DID NOT KNOW IT --

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:31.949
SERVED AS A MOTIVATION FOR

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:34.352
PEOPLE TO FIND OUT WHAT COVERAGE

00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:35.786
THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AND THEN

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:37.154
ROLL AND SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:38.489
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDIC HOW DON'T

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:39.357
REALIZE IT.

00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:41.859
AND GO TO COVER CALIFORNIA TO

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:43.628
SHOP FOR COVERAGE AND FIND OUT

00:37:43.694 --> 00:37:45.329
THAT THEY CAN ENROLL IN MEDICARE

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:46.130
OUT WITH NO PREMIUMS.

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:50.334
AS THE THE LACK OF A PENALTY.

00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:51.702
WOULD WOULD REDUCE THAT

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:54.338
MOTIVATION TO FIND OUT WHAT

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:55.506
THEY'RE ELIGIBLE.

00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:56.941
FOR AND THEN AS WE COULD SEE

00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:58.242
SOME SMALL CHANGES IN EMPLOYER

00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:59.810
SPONSORED INSURANCE BUT THEY'RE

00:37:59.877 --> 00:38:00.745
NOT.

00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:02.713
AS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AS A

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.316
SHARE OF OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:07.885
IN TOPICS CONFERENCE.

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:09.854
SO COMBINING.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.889
THE FACTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:13.324
MANDATE PENALTY GOING AWAY

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:15.893
FEDERALLY WITH OTHER TRENDS LAKE

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.829
POPULATION GROWTH PREMIUM GROWTH.

00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:21.265
WE PROJECTS THAT FOUR MILLION

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:22.733
CALIFORNIANS COULD.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.102
BE UNINSURED IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:26.837
GROWING TO FOUR POINT FOUR

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:28.406
MILLION IN.

00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:28.973
TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THE

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.242
LARGEST GROUP OF UNINSURED --

00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:33.477
WILL CONTINUE TO BE UNDOCUMENTED

00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:35.179
CALIFORNIANS --

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:36.514
THE NEXT BIGGEST GROUP WOULD BE

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.682
THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR COVERED

00:38:37.748 --> 00:38:39.784

WITHOUT SUBSIDIES --

00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:46.424
BUT NOT AND ROLES.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:47.992
THE PEOPLE THE PROJECT TO BE

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:49.460
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL BUT NOT

00:38:49.527 --> 00:38:50.294
AND ROLLED.

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:52.463
AND THEN SAM WHO HAVE AN OFFER

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.032
OF EMPLOYER COVERAGE BUT DON'T --

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:57.168
ENROLLED PRIMARILY DUE TO

00:38:57.234 --> 00:38:58.769
AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS SO I'M

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:01.872
GONNA TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT --

00:39:01.939 --> 00:39:04.041
A FEW OF THESE GROUPS.

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:07.745
SO I AS WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:09.647
THE OF THE FULL COMMITTEE

00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:11.015
HEARING IN FEBRUARY.

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:14.719
THE LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED OLD

00:39:14.785 --> 00:39:16.454
HAVE A PARTICULARLY HIGH AND

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.124
INSURANCE RATE. 90% ALMOST --

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:23.594
COMPARED 211% AN INSURANCE RATE

00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:24.795
FOR CITIZENS AND DOCUMENTED

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:26.530
CALIFORNIANS OF THE SAME INCOME

00:39:26.597 --> 00:39:27.431
LEVEL.

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:28.632
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.601
EXCLUDED FROM MEDICAID

00:39:30.668 --> 00:39:34.271
ELIGIBILITY UNDER FEDERAL POLICY.

00:39:34.338 --> 00:39:35.339
THEY'RE EXCLUDED FROM.

00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:37.408
ENROLLING IN COVERED CALIFORNIA

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:39.143
EVEN WITHOUT SUBSIDIES THEY

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.377
COULDN'T THEY COULD PURCHASE

00:39:40.444 --> 00:39:41.445
COVERAGE DIRECTLY FROM AN

00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:43.748
INSURER BUT AT THIS INCOME LEVEL --

00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:46.317
THAT IS GENERALLY AND AFFORDABLE.

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:47.785
AND EVEN THOUGH THEY MAKE UP

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:54.892
ALMOST 10% OF THE WORKFORCE

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:55.893
UNDOCUMENTED.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.061
WORKERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE

00:39:57.128 --> 00:39:58.796
OFFERED JOB THIS COVERAGE

00:39:58.863 --> 00:39:59.663
BECAUSE OF THE INDUSTRIES AND

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:04.101
OCCUPATIONS AID TEND TO WORK ON

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:06.804
TURNING TO THE THE FORD ABILITY

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:08.472
CHALLENGES.

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:09.440
A IT.

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:10.608
THERE ARE EVEN THOUGH WE'VE MADE

00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:13.511
SOME WHAT ABOUT CARE ACT IN

00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:14.812
IMPROVING INDIVIDUAL MARKET

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:16.680
AFFORDABILITY THERE ARE STILL

00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:18.716
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS FOR THOSE

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:20.751
EVEN ROLLED AND THOSE WHO ARE

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:22.686
UNINSURED. FOR THOSE WHO ARE

00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:24.722
ELIGIBLE FOR A CA SUBSIDIES FOR

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:27.091
THOSE HEARING TOO MUCH AND IT'S

00:40:27.158 --> 00:40:28.159
A PROBLEM --

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:29.693
THE PREMIUM SIDE BUT ALSO IN

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.362
TERMS OF WHAT PEOPLE PAY OUT OF

00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:32.363
POCKET.

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:34.231
AND THE STATUS SPECIFICALLY IS

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:35.800
FROM IT A STUDY BY HARVARD

00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:37.768
RESPECT SURVEY BY HARVARD

00:40:37.835 --> 00:40:39.970
RESEARCHERS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO

00:40:40.037 --> 00:40:43.841
ARE ENROLLED IN THE INDIVIDUAL

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:44.608
MARKET.

00:40:44.675 --> 00:40:47.878
AND ROUGHLY FOUR OUT OF TEN THAT

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:49.146
HAD HAVE SOME OR A LOT OF

00:40:49.213 --> 00:40:51.682
DIFFICULTY AFFORDING PREMIUMS

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:54.852
AND THEIR SURVEY SHOWS THAT THIS.

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:56.487
LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY IS

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:59.423
RELATIVELY SIMILAR ACROSS INCOME

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:00.024
LEVELS.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.092
OF THE ROUGHLY THREE OUT OF TEN

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:04.595
HAD DIFFICULTY AFFORDING OUT OF

00:41:04.662 --> 00:41:06.664
POCKET COSTS WITH A SLIGHTLY

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.833
LOWER PERCENTAGE IN THE HIGHER

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:11.368
INCOME GROUPS.

00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:13.337
FACING THIS DIFFICULTIES.

00:41:13.404 --> 00:41:14.004
THERE IS NOT SIMILAR AT THE DATA

00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:17.074
AVAILABLE AT THIS LEVEL OF FOR

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:18.976
THE UNINSURED WHO ARE ELIGIBLE

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:20.344
FOR COVERAGE CALIFORNIA BUT WE

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:22.513
DO KNOW FROM THE CALIFORNIA

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.848
HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY.

00:41:23.914 --> 00:41:25.983
THAT COST AS THE TOP REASON FOR

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.251
THAT GROUP TO REPORT LACKING

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:28.586
COVERAGE AND THAT'S TRUE

00:41:28.652 --> 00:41:30.588
REGARDLESS OF WHAT.

00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:33.858
INCOME LEVEL YOU'RE LOOKING AT

00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:36.360
SO TO GIVE TWO EXAMPLES OF THE

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:38.696
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES.

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:41.498
AT FIRST IT TAKE A FULL TIME

00:41:41.565 --> 00:41:43.534
WORKER IN LA WHO'S EARNING

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:45.502
MINIMUM WAGE OR ABOUT THIRTY

00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:47.071
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BASED ON

00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:50.040
THE UPCOMING LA MINIMUM WAGE.

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:52.142
AND THIS IS A SINGLE WORKER NO

00:41:52.209 --> 00:41:52.543
KIDS.

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.345
HE WOULD PAY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:56.113
A MONTH FOR PREMIUMS FOR THE

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.715
SECOND LOWEST SILVER PLAN WITH

00:41:57.781 --> 00:41:59.617
THE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:01.085
DEDUCTIBLE.

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:02.953
A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH --

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.289
FOR A BRONZE PLAN WITH A SIXTY

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:06.557
THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:09.026
OR HE COULD GO WITHOUT INSURANCE

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:12.029
AND DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH HE'S

00:42:12.096 --> 00:42:15.266
PAYING FOR THESE.

00:42:15.332 --> 00:42:17.167
AMOUNTS THAT COULD BE AN

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:22.006
AFFORDABLE.

00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:23.540
A THIS IS AN EXAMPLE HE TALKS

00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:25.743
ABOUT AT THE AFFORDABILITY

00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:28.245
HEARING IN FEBRUARY.

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:28.979
A MARRIED COUPLE EARNING.

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:30.814
EARNING ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR

00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:34.018
THOUSAND DOLLARS BOTH EACH FIFTY

00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:34.919
FIVE LIVING IN SAN MATTEO.

00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:36.720
BUT THIS COUPLE WOULD FACE SOME

00:42:36.787 --> 00:42:38.689
HARD CHOICES A IT.

00:42:38.756 --> 00:42:40.557
PAYING THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:42:40.624 --> 00:42:42.826
A MONTH FOR A BRONZE PLAN WHICH

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:44.795
WOULD BE 22% OF THEIR INCOME

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:46.697
BEFORE THEY PAY ANY OUT OF

00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:49.867
POCKET COSTS UNDER THE SIXTY

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:51.201
THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE.

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:54.104
OR IF THEY WANTED TO REDUCE

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:56.540
THEIR OUT OF POCKET RISK TO A

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:57.074
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

00:42:57.141 --> 00:42:58.909
DEDUCTIBLE IN A SILVER PLAN THEY

00:42:58.976 --> 00:43:00.544
WOULD PAID TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:02.346
A MONTH FOR THE SECOND LOWEST

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:03.113
COST SILVER PLAN.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.149
THAT'SALMOST A THIRD OF THEIR

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:07.551
INCOME ON PREMIUMS ALONE.

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:09.253
THE OR THEY COULD GO WITHOUT

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.055
INSURANCE AND SAID THESE LAKE

00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:13.223
THE THE MINIMUM WAGE WORKER

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:14.525
EXAMPLE --

00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:17.127
IN BOTH OF THESE EXAMPLES THEY

00:43:17.194 --> 00:43:19.363
WOULD FACE VERY DIFFICULT

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.899
CHOICES.

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:23.834
ON TUESDAY WE RELEASED A NEW

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:26.003
BLOG POST ON THE GROUP OF

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.505
CALIFORNIANS WHO'S UNINSURED BUT

00:43:28.572 --> 00:43:30.040
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL.

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:33.210
AND THERE THE THESE ARE A FEW

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:35.579
EXAMPLES OF WHY THIS GROUP STILL

00:43:35.646 --> 00:43:37.581
EXISTS --

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:38.749
WE'D AND I WANNA START UP A

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:42.286
NOTING THAT WE DO HAVE A TAKE

00:43:42.353 --> 00:43:44.154
OPERATE OF MEDI CAL IN THE STATE

00:43:44.221 --> 00:43:45.789
OF MORE THAN 90%.

00:43:45.856 --> 00:43:46.657
WHICH IS A A GREAT

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:47.958
ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A BIG

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:50.260
IMPROVEMENT FROM PRIOR TO THE

00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:52.096
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S --

00:43:52.162 --> 00:43:54.398

00:50:36.633 --> 00:50:38.068
SUBSIDY PROGRAM.

00:50:38.135 --> 00:50:38.835
WE BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO

00:50:38.902 --> 00:50:40.237
COMPONENTS WILL WORK IN TANDEM

00:50:40.303 --> 00:50:41.138
TO INCREASE ACCESS AND

00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:42.506
AFFORDABILITY TO HEALTH CARE

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:43.807
COVERAGE.

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:45.142
AND GROW UPON THE SUCCESS OF THE

00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:48.879
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:50.380
REGARDING THE MANDATE WE'VE

MODEL OR PROPOSAL CLOSELY OFFER

00:50:51.848 --> 00:50:53.350
THE FEDERAL LAW.

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:53.917
THE MANDATE WOULD BE

00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:54.918
ADMINISTERED BY THE FRANCHISE

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:56.853
TAX BOARD IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:57.387

AND THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED

00:50:59.823 --> 00:51:00.490
HEALTHCARE.

00:51:00.557 --> 00:51:02.626
THE PENALTY WOULD BE SCALABLE

00:51:02.692 --> 00:51:04.161
BASED ON INCOME AND FAMILY SIZE.

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:04.861
AND MAINTAIN THE FEDERAL

00:51:04.928 --> 00:51:07.464
EXEMPTIONS AS CODIFIED TODAY OUR

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:08.899
PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO JUST

00:51:08.965 --> 00:51:10.267
AUTOMATICALLY IF THE FEDERAL

00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:12.035
GOVERNMENT WERE TO REINSTATE THE

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:13.703
FEDERAL PENALTY --

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:14.604
BASED ON DISCUSSIONS AND

00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:15.705
FEEDBACK WE'VE HAD WITH

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:17.874
STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMITTEE STAFF

00:51:17.941 --> 00:51:18.875
WE ARE.

00:51:18.942 --> 00:51:20.444
PROPOSING TO DEPOSIT ANY PENALTY

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:21.578
REVENUE DIRECTLY INTO THE

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:24.481
GENERAL FUND.

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:25.048
NEXT IS THE STATE'S SUBSIDY

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:26.049
PROGRAM.

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:27.184
OUR PROPOSAL WOULD OFFER STATES

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.618
LEVEL SUBSIDIES TO INDIVIDUALS

00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:30.554
WITH INCOMES BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.555
FIFTY AND 60% OF THE FEDERAL

POVERTY LEVEL FOR A FAMILY FOR

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:36.760
THIS WOULD BE. 620-002-0050.

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:37.294
THOUSAND THIS WOULD MAKE

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.361
CALIFORNIA FIRST STATE IN THE

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:39.963
NATION TO PROVIDE STATE LEVEL

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:41.465
SUBSIDIES THE AND TO MIDDLE

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:42.966
INCOME CONSUMERS.

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:44.100
SPECIFICALLY THE PROPOSED

00:51:44.167 --> 00:51:46.136
PROGRAM WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:46.570
ANNUAL GENERAL FUND

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:48.638
APPROPRIATION BEEN MISTER BY

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:49.806
COVERED CALIFORNIA.

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:51.441
PROVIDE ADVANCED PREMIUM

00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:53.677
ASSISTANCE AND SUNSET DECEMBER

00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:56.146
THIRTY FIRST.

00:51:56.213 --> 00:51:56.680
TWENTY TWENTY TWO BASED ON

00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:57.414
APPROPRIATE FUNDS COVER

00:51:57.481 --> 00:51:58.548
CALIFORNIA WOULD DESIGN A

00:51:58.615 --> 00:52:03.353
SUBSIDY PROGRAM ON ANNUAL BASIS.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.988
FOR THE ANNUAL OPEN ENROLLMENT.

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:06.756
PERIOD THE FINAL SONG OF PROGRAM

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:08.692
DESIGN WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:09.292
ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:10.794
APPROVAL.

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:11.795
CONSUMERS WILL RECEIVE THEIR

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:13.063
ESTIMATES SUBSIDY AMOUNT WHEN

00:52:13.129 --> 00:52:15.432
THEY ENROLL FOR COVERAGE FOR

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:16.533
THAT COVERAGE HERE.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:17.467
AND AGAIN THIS PROCESS IS

00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:19.603
SUBSTANTIVELY SIMILAR TO WHAT IS

00:52:19.669 --> 00:52:20.136
CURRENTLY IN PLACE AT THE

00:52:20.203 --> 00:52:24.574
FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:26.543
SO I'LL NOTE A FEW KEY DESIGN

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.345
CHOICES WE MADE WHEN DESIGNING

00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:30.146
THIS PROPOSAL.

00:52:30.213 --> 00:52:31.915
FIRST I'LL NOTE AGAIN THAT THIS

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:33.383
VERY CLOSELY MON MIR'S THE

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.352
FEDERAL FRAMEWORK THAT'S IN

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:36.987
PLACE THIS WAS --

00:52:37.053 --> 00:52:38.421
Q. DESIGN CHOICE AND THAT IT

00:52:38.488 --> 00:52:39.723
WILL ALLOW FOLKS TO BE MORE

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:41.424
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT'S CURRENTLY

00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:43.260
IN PLACE AND BUILD UPON.

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:44.561
WHAT IS ALREADY BEEN?

00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:45.762
PIONEERED BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:46.930
ACT.

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:47.797
NEXT IS THE INTEL ON THE

00:52:47.864 --> 00:52:49.599
ADMINISTRATION THAT ANY SUBSIDY

00:52:49.666 --> 00:52:51.334
AMOUNT APPROPRIATE ON ANNUAL

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:53.537
BASIS CLOSELY NEARS THE REVENUE

00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:54.070
THAT WE GENERATE FROM THE

00:52:54.137 --> 00:52:55.338
PENALTY.

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:56.640
IN PLACE.

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:57.274
WE HAD PREVIOUSLY SHARED

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.909
ESTIMATES OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

00:52:58.975 --> 00:53:00.076
MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL

00:53:00.143 --> 00:53:01.244
BASIS BASED OFF.

00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:03.079
INFORMATION FROM THE IRS FOR TAX

00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:04.581
YOUR TWENTY SIXTEEN FROM THE

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:06.149
FEDERAL PENALTY.

00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:07.117
WE'LL UPDATE THIS REVENUE

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:08.552
ESTIMATE AT ME REVISION ENSURE

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:10.053
DETAILS AT THAT TIME HOWEVER WE

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.288
WILL NOTE THAT.

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:12.722
THE CALIFORNIA FILING THRESHOLD

00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:14.124
IS HIGHER THAN THE FEDERAL

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.560
FILING THRESHOLD SO FEWER PEOPLE

00:53:16.626 --> 00:53:19.262
WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE PENALTY --

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:19.863
NEXT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:20.630
THIS WILL NOT BE A NEW

00:53:20.697 --> 00:53:22.666
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM HOWEVER WE

00:53:22.732 --> 00:53:23.600
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AROUND US MS

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:24.901
MAY VERY SIGNIFICANTLY ON A YEAR

00:53:24.968 --> 00:53:26.369
TO YEAR BASIS.

00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:27.571
IT'S NOT OUR INTENT THAT FOLKS

00:53:27.637 --> 00:53:31.007
TO RECEIVE A GET A DIFFERENT

00:53:31.074 --> 00:53:31.641
AMOUNT.

00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:33.510
ONCE OF REVENUE AMOUNT COMES IN

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:36.046
BUT ON A SUBSEQUENT YEAR THE NOT

00:53:36.112 --> 00:53:37.247
APPROPRIATE FOR THAT PROGRAM MAY

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:38.748
DECREASE OR INCREASE WHICH WILL

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:40.417
CHANGE THEMSELVES IN OUT FOR

00:53:40.483 --> 00:53:43.853
THOSE INDIVIDUALS.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.388
I'LL ALSO NOTE THAT WE DO NOT

00:53:45.455 --> 00:53:46.556
INTEND THE SUBSIDIES PROVIDE TO

00:53:46.623 --> 00:53:48.325
FOLKS BELOW 210050% OF THE

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:49.326
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO BE

00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:51.661
HIGHER THAN INDIVIDUALS ABOUT

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:52.562
210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:54.130
LEVEL.

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:55.699
AND AFFECT OUR PROPOSAL WOULD.

00:53:55.765 --> 00:53:57.233
SLOW THE DECLINE THAT IS

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.335
CURRENTLY SEEN ON THE FEDERAL

00:53:58.401 --> 00:53:59.936
MARKETPLACE FOR THE SUBSIDIES

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:03.773
RECEIVED BY THESE INDIVIDUALS.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:04.908
AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO NOTE

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:06.076
OUR PROPOSAL TO SUNSET THE

00:54:06.142 --> 00:54:07.811

THE GOVERNOR WHILE THIS PROPOSAL

00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:14.150
WOULD MAINTAIN MARKET STABILITY.

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:15.185
THE GOVERNOR HAS CALLED ON THE

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:16.319

ALL AMERICANS.

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:20.557
WITHOUT FEDERAL SUPPORT

00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:21.524
CALIFORNIAN OTHER STATES ARE

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:23.193
SEVERELY LIMITED IN THEIR

INDIVIDUAL MARKET THROUGH A

00:55:11.574 --> 00:55:13.543
COMBINATION OF MARKET REFORMS AN

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:14.811
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.

00:55:14.878 --> 00:55:16.446

CORRECT IN REDUCING THE RATE OF

INDIVIDUALS PURCHASING TODAY.

00:57:35.819 --> 00:57:36.753
THE STAFF ANALYSIS DOESN'T

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.054
EXCELLENT JOB SUMMARIZING THE

00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:52.869
MORE AFFORDABLE.

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:54.003
IN ADDITION TO GENERATING

ENROLLMENT WHICH IN TURN CAN

00:57:58.808 --> 00:57:59.709
HAVE POSITIVE IMPACTS ON

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:01.411
PREMIUMS.

00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:02.679
IT ALSO INDUCES MORE FEDERAL

FEDERAL TAX CREDITS THAT ARE

00:58:11.521 --> 00:58:12.956
AVAILABLE TODAY?

00:58:13.022 --> 00:58:14.557
AS WE KNOW PREMIUMS AND COST

00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:16.226
SHARING SUBSIDIES MAKE COVERAGE

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:18.161
MORE AFFORDABLE AND CREATE

00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:19.462
SIGNIFICANT GAINS AND ENROLLMENT.

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:20.964
POLICIES THAT ADDRESS THE TAX

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:22.632

LEVEL BIGGER SUBSIDIES DO MATTER

00:58:41.718 --> 00:58:42.785
AND GENERATE SIGNIFICANT NEW

00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:44.120

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:50.727
AN INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT AND

COST SHARING SUBSIDIES.

00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:53.730

COVERAGE.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.801

I LIVE IN OAKLAND.

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:12.615
SO BEFORE THE ACA WENT INTO

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:14.484
FACTS I A NEEDED TO HAVE A JOB

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:15.985
THAT GAVE ME HEALTH CARE I HAVE

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:18.288
MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE WHICH IS A

00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:19.055
WOMAN.

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:21.057
THAT DOESN'T DO ANY THE HOMES TO

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:22.158
ME -- BUT IT

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:23.927
IS A PRE EXISTING CONDITION UPON

00:59:23.993 --> 00:59:25.828
WHICH I WAS DENIED COVERAGE AS A

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:28.264
YOUNG ADULT SO ONCE THE ACA WAS

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:30.433
PASSED THAT ALLOWED ME TO HAVE

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.135
SOME OPTIONS ON THE LAST YEAR I

00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:33.636
LEFT MY JOB --

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:35.038
AND STARTED MY OWN BUSINESS

00:59:35.104 --> 00:59:36.673
WHICH IS SOMETHING I'VE JUMPED

00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:38.608
OF DOING FOR A LONG TIME --

00:59:38.675 --> 00:59:41.778
AND I KNEW THAT COVER CALIFORNIA

00:59:41.844 --> 00:59:42.378
WOULD GIVE ME THE HEALTH CARE

00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:42.946
THAT I NEEDED.

00:59:43.012 --> 00:59:44.480
MY HUSBAND IS AN ADJUNCT

00:59:44.547 --> 00:59:46.149
PROFESSOR HE RECENTLY GOT HIS

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:48.418
PHD FROM UC BERKELEY AND HE WAS

00:59:48.484 --> 00:59:50.053
ABLE TO FIND A TEACHING JOB BUT

00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:52.188
AS AN ADJUNCT AND IF YOU KNOW

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:52.922
ABOUT ADDS ON JOBS.

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:54.123
THEY DON'T PAY VERY WELL AND

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:57.126
THEY DEFINITELY DO SO THAT MEANS

00:59:57.193 --> 01:00:00.863
WERE BOTH ON THE EXCHANGE --

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.832
IF WE WANT MARY.

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:04.000
BOTH OF US INDIVIDUALLY WOULD

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:05.702
COVER QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIES IN

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.236
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:08.938
BUT BECAUSE WE'RE MARRIED OUR

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:11.374
JOINT GROSS INCOME IS JUST OVER

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:12.976
ABOUT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:13.643
LIMIT.

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.712
AND SO WE DON'T QUALIFY FOR ANY

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:18.214
SUBSIDY ONE OF THOSE FAMILIES

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:20.116
THAT'S FACING THOSE DIFFICULT

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:22.218
THE CHOICE.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:23.353
AND THE RATES KEEP GOING UP --

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:24.620
I ACTUALLY ENROLLED IN COBRA

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:26.489
BECAUSE IT WAS A BETTER VALUE

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:29.025
COSTS THEN THE EXCHANGE FOR ME --

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:31.427
AND MY PARTNER IS ON THE LOWEST

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:33.029
COVERED CALIFORNIA PLAN SO WE

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:34.797
HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO USE IT

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:36.299
BECAUSE THE OUT OF POCKET COSTS

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:38.201
ARE REALLY HIGH --

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:40.536
TOGETHER WE PAY ABOUT NINE

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:41.204
HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IN

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.106
INSURANCE PREMIUMS WHICH COMES

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:45.141

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:45.775
YEAR.

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:48.244
ON IT'S ABOUT 15% OF OUR INCOME

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:49.812
AND THAT'S JUST FOR PREMIUMS

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:50.847
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY FOR THE HEALTH

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:53.383
CARE ITSELF IT'S JUST PAYING.

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.351
THE INSURANCE COMPANY SO THAT

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:56.986
THEY CAN MAKE A PROFIT --

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:59.789
WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT JOINING THAT

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:01.324
ESTIMATED 13% IN THE

TALK ABOUT TO STOPPING PAYING --

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:08.631
ANY PENALTY THAT WOULD EXIST

01:01:08.698 --> 01:01:10.867
WOULD BE FAR LESS THAN THE TEN

01:01:10.933 --> 01:01:11.467
THOUSAND DOLLARS WE'RE PAYING

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:12.335

IN ADDITION TO THAT WE OFTEN

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:16.506
TALK ABOUT GETTING DIVORCED SO

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:18.474
THAT WE CAN GET SUBSIDIES TO PAY

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:19.876
FOR A HEALTHCARE --

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:21.811
WE TALK ABOUT THAT LIKE EVERY

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:23.546
MONTH WHEN WE PAY THE BILL.

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:25.481
HEALTHCARE IS A GREAT AND IT

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:27.283

01:01:29.886 --> 01:01:31.187

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:32.922
AND SO I'M HERE TAKING THE DAY

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:34.991

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:02.945
OTHER STATES LIKE --

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:06.081
MASSACHUSETTS AND OTHER STATES

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:07.516
THAT HAVE A SUB THESE LIKE THIS

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:08.651
DON'T ACTUALLY TRIP THEIR

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:09.852
CREDITS THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.220

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:16.459
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT

THERE IS NO INCOME TAX INVOLVED

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:18.794
AND SO.

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:19.962
THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:21.497
ASK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR MORE

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.365
COMMENTARY ON THE BENEFITS AND

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.167
DRAWBACKS OF THAT SORT OF AN

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.669
APPROACH --

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:27.970
AS AS THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:30.039
NAY I THINK THEY WOULD LOOK AT

01:08:30.105 --> 01:08:32.675
AS THEY DEVELOP THEIR PROPOSAL.

01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:33.709
OKAY THANK YOU.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.511
I ASSUME FINANCE PRESENTED

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:38.080
THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.882
AT THIS POINT OKAY CENTER SO I

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.116
APOLOGIZE --

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:43.586
NOT A PROBLEM --

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:45.621
WITH REGARD TO THE TRAILER BILL

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:47.556
LANGUAGE CHU REVEALED --

01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:50.192
TODAY --

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:51.794
IT'S GOING TO GENERATE ABOUT

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:52.728
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.396
WHAT THE ESTIMATE HAS BEEN BASED

01:08:54.463 --> 01:08:57.066
ON FEDERAL --

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:59.134
EXAMINATIONS --

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:01.537
THE THE THE BIGGEST CONCERN I

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:03.973
HAVE IS HOW WHY IS IT BEING

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:06.175
DEPOSITED INTO THE GENERAL FUND

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:07.643
I THOUGHT THE PURPOSE OF THE THE

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.311
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WAS TO NUMBER

01:09:09.378 --> 01:09:12.181
ONE GET PEOPLE TO BUY INSURANCE

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:13.549
TO EQUALIZE THE POOL.

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:16.051
AND TO PROVIDE FOR SUBSIDIES AND

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:17.152
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE --

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:20.122
THE YOUNG LADY FOR COMING AND

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.689
SPEAKING AND EXPLAINING YOUR

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.191
PLIGHT.

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:24.193
HI I HOPE YOU DON'T GET DIVORCED

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:26.028
BECAUSE OF OF THE STATE'S --

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:28.898
COVER CALIFORNIA PROGRAM YOUR

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:30.432
MESSAGE HAS BEEN HEARD LOUD AND

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:32.001
CLEAR -- MY

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:33.435
CONCERN IS THAT --

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:34.503
YOU KNOW THE GENERAL FUND YOU'RE

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:35.905
YOU'RE BASICALLY PUTTING IN THE

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:37.106
FREE FOR ALL ACCOUNT YOU KNOW

01:09:37.172 --> 01:09:38.874
THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF ASKS

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:40.276
IN A LOT OF NEEDS OF THE STATE

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:43.045
AND EVERYBODY'S GONNA HAVE THEIR

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:44.280
HAND IN THAT.

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:45.648
IN A GENERAL FUND --

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:47.216
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE MAY REVISE

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.784
AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.286
CONSUMMATION OF A BUDGET AND I

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.153
THINK IT WOULD MAKE THE

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.122
GOVERNOR'S ARGUMENT FOR

01:09:53.188 --> 01:09:53.656
IMPLEMENTING AN INDIVIDUAL

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:55.124
MANDATE --

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.692
MAYBE MORE PALATABLE TO PEOPLE

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:58.527
MIGHT FIND IT UNPALATABLE --

01:09:58.594 --> 01:09:59.929
WHEN HE DISCOVERS SHE'S GOING

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:00.763
INTO THE GENERAL FUND WHICH

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:02.464
MEANS BASICALLY CAN BE USED FOR

01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:03.198
ANYTHING?

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:05.534
SO THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST

01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:08.070
QUESTION THE SECOND QUESTION IS --

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.439
DEPENDING ON THE REVENUE STREAM

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:12.841
THAT COMES FROM ALL OF THIS IS A

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:15.744
ARE ARE WE SEEING AND MAYBE --

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:17.479
OTHERS CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:19.014
IS A SUBSIDY IS AT THE SAME

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:20.449
EVERY YEAR OR IS IT VARYING

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:22.084
EVERY YEAR SO WHEN YOU'RE

01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:23.485
GETTING A SUBSIDY YOU DON'T KNOW

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.020
FROM YEAR TO YEAR WHETHER OR NOT

01:10:25.087 --> 01:10:26.455
IT'S GOING TO BE MORE AFFORDABLE

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:28.257
OR LESS AFFORDABLE FROM YEAR TO

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:29.391
YEAR LIKELY --

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:31.694
Là BUT MORE ABOUT THAT.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.861
BALL ADDRESSED THE GENERAL FUND

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:34.363
QUESTION I THINK FROM OUR

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.298
PERSPECTIVE THE PENALTY AND SO

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:38.233
THE PROGRAM WOULD BOTH BEGIN

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.002
JANUARY FIRST --

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:40.636
TWENTY TWENTY WE'RE RECOMMENDING

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:42.171
DEPOSITED DEPOSITING IT INTO THE

01:10:42.237 --> 01:10:43.572
GENERAL FUND BECAUSE IT WILL BE

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:46.375
ADMINISTRATIVELY SIMPLER.

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:47.843
TO HAVE THE PENALTY REVENUE FALL

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.712
INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND PAID

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:50.946
OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE

01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:51.914
WE WILL NOT HAVE THE ACTUAL

01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:53.782
REVENUE AMOUNTS UNTIL APRIL

01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:56.118

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:57.286
TWENTY TWENTY TAX YEAR.

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:58.520
AND SO I THINK IN ORDER BEGIN

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.389
THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM IT MADE MORE

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:01.557
SENSE.

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:02.491
TO BEGIN IMMEDIATELY PAYING IT

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:03.826
ALL THE GENERAL FUND BUT WE'RE

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:05.761
HAPPY TO CONSIDER COMMENTS FROM

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:07.262
THE COMMITTEE.

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:07.896
BY RAP PRETTY SURE THAT I KNOW

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:11.000
AND I HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER --

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:12.167
WORKING OUT WITH --

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:13.135
COVER CALIFORNIA AND DEPOSIT

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.203
INTO AN ACCOUNT THAT.

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:16.639
PROVIDES THE ABSOLUTE NEXUS FOR

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:18.240
THE SUBSIDY AND THE HELP F

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:20.709
PEOPLE THAT HAVING TROUBLE TO

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.611
AFFORD INSURANCE.

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:24.146
PREMIUMS AND AND THE STATE OF

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:25.514
CALIFORNIA I THINK IT WOULD IT

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:26.849
WOULD CERTAINLY GIVE ME A MARK

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:31.520
OF A COMFORT LEVEL --

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:32.154
AND THEN IT CAN IT CAN NOW THIS

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:33.355
MEANS.

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:36.025
YOU DISCUSS THE THE THE VARIABLE.

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:38.560
SUBSIDIES EVERY YEAR AND WHEN

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:40.229

I'M SORRY I'M NOT BEEN CUT A

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:42.865
DEAL FOR THE PAST MONTH SORRY

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:46.535
YOU KNOW THE PHARMACIST COULD

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:48.337
BETTER GET HIMSELF WELL BUT THIS

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:48.971
VIRUS HAS BEEN ABOUT

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:49.271
[inaudible]

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:51.440
ONE OUR I'M CONCERNED AT THE OUR

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:52.207
OUR STATE --

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:54.510
PROJECTIONS OF REVENUE ARE ARE.

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.979
COMING IN LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED.

01:11:57.046 --> 01:12:01.216
AND THAT I'M CONCERNED THAT --

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:03.919
IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY OF

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:05.354
YOU KNOW LOOKING AT REDUCING

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:07.122
SUBSIDIES AND I DON'T KNOW HOW

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:08.590
THE NEXUS WORKS WITH OUR INCOME

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:09.858
STREAMS.

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:10.759
MAYBE CAN ELABORATE ON THAT BUT

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:11.360
THAT.

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:12.428
WOULD IT WOULD SPEND THAT THE

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:14.163
DELTA YEAR TO YEAR THAT PEOPLE

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:15.898
CAN EXPECT TO SEE --

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:17.700
WHETHER THE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:20.102
ARE GOING UP BREWING DOWN AND

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.070
AND I I CERTAINLY WANT TO

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:22.938
MINIMIZE THE ANXIETY THAT MANY

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.540
OF OUR OUR RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN.

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:25.708
KNOWING FROM WE HEAR TO YOUR

01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:26.575
THAT THEY CAN LOOK FORWARD TO

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.811
HAVING COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE.

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.546
THE CURRENT OF FEDERAL SCHEME

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:31.480
FOR HOW TE SUBSIDIES ARE

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:33.716
DISTRIBUTED IS BASED ON A

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:34.883
MAXIMUM CONTRIBUTION.

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:35.718
THE MAXIMUM REQUIRED

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:36.852
CONTRIBUTION THAT AS A

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:38.821
PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME SO IT

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:41.957
IS A SLIDING SCALE AND SO IF

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.058
YOU'RE.

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.393
UP 24100% SO IF YOUR INCOME DOES

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.828
NOT CHANGE YOU WOULD BE PAYING A

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:47.563
FIXED PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:49.631
IN PREMIUMS IF YOU CHOSE THE

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:51.767
SECOND LOWEST COST SILVER PLAN.

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:53.502
NOW DEPENDING ON WHAT OTHER

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:55.471
PLANS ARE AVAILABLE YOU MAY SEE

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.239
FLUCTUATIONS IN WHAT YOU ARE

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:58.340
PAYING --

01:12:58.407 --> 01:13:00.142
BUT IT IS A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:01.977
YOUR INCOME NOW WE SHARE THE

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:03.212
SAME CONCERNS IF THE STATE IS

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:04.813
PLANNING ON YOU KNOW HAVING

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.881
DIFFERENT AMOUNTS BASED ON

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:07.382
WHAT'S AVAILABLE --

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:10.152
BUT IT IS A SLIDING SCALE TIED

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.488
TO A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME.

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:15.324
IT IS DIFFERENT PLEASE THANK YOU

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:17.059
IT.

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:19.261
WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE IF THE

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:21.497
PENALTY AMOUNT OR PERCENTAGE IS

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:23.098
THE SAME YEAR TO YEAR BUT THE

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:24.900
HELP THAT PEOPLE GET BOUNCES

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:26.235
AROUND.

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:30.005
THAT I THINK WOULD NOT ACTIVE

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.174
THAT WE SINKS TO THIS COMMITTEE

THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET FOR YEARS

01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:44.620
BECAUSE THEY ARE.

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:46.421

01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:47.890
THEIR OWN BUSINESS.

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:49.224
THEY WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO

PLAN AND BUDGET THERE ARE MANY

01:13:50.959 --> 01:13:52.227
OTHER PEOPLE FOR WHOM THE

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:53.762
INDIVIDUAL MARKET IS SOMETHING

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:55.898
THAT THEY USE IN BETWEEN JOBS

01:13:55.964 --> 01:13:57.466

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:48.684
HEALTH FOR ALL --

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.052

HOPEFULLY WE CAN --

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:56.892
AS WE TRY --

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.527
TO IMPROVE ON THE PROPOSALS --

01:14:58.594 --> 01:15:00.362
THAT YOU'RE PUTTING FORD --

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:01.363
SO FIRST OF ALL LET ME START

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:02.431
WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:03.398
PORTION BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:05.234
WE'RE MAINLY TALKING ABOUT

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:09.004
SUBSIDIES I THINK THERE'S THOSE

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:10.873
TWO SIR GO TOGETHER AND IN A FOR

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:12.274
SOMEONE I THINK THE GOVERNOR --

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:13.408
FOR FOR SUPPORTING INDIVIDUAL

01:15:13.475 --> 01:15:14.610
MANDATE SOMETIMES IS THAT IT'S

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:16.011
PUT THE POLITICALLY LEAST

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:16.678
POPULAR --

01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:19.414
BUT FRANKLY THIS WEEK KNOWLEDGE

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:21.450
THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY

01:15:21.516 --> 01:15:22.951
NECESSARY TO MAKE THE SYSTEM

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:25.387
WORK RIGHT --

01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:26.355
THE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN --

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:28.957
THE MORE EFFICIENT THE SYSTEM IS --

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:30.492
THE THE BETTER AS IN FACT --

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:32.127
THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:32.461
GOVERNMENT --

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:35.497
OURS CONGRESS AND THE TRUMP

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:37.499
ADMINISTRATION SIDE TO ZERO OUT

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:38.834
THE PENALTY ITSELF.

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:39.801
HEALTHY SO THERE'S STILL MANDATE

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:41.603
BUT ZEROED OUT THE PENALTY

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:43.105
ESSENTIALLY IS CAUSED A COVERED

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:44.640
CALIFORNIA UNDERSTAND TO HAVE TO

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:46.208
RAISE PREMIUMS WHILE THESE 5% OF

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:47.643
THAT PREMIUM RAISES RELATE IS

01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:49.077
RELATED TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:50.312
ADMINISTRATION TO DESTABILIZE

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:51.780
MARK INCLUDING BEHOLD INDIVIDUAL

01:15:51.847 --> 01:15:52.581
PENALTY.

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:53.815
SO I MEAN IT'S COSTING PEOPLE

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:55.284
WHEN THAT HAPPENED SO I'M GLAD

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:56.385
TO KNOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:57.486
REVERSING THAT.

01:15:57.552 --> 01:15:59.121
I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:15:59.187 --> 01:16:01.356
ADMINISTRATION'S DESIRE TO

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:03.492
PERHAPS THAT DIRECTLY PARALLEL

01:16:03.558 --> 01:16:05.227
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:06.962
MEAN THERE'S SOME SIMPLICITY

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:08.797
THERE -- BUT

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:10.065
I I DO JUST WANT MAKE NOTE THAT

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:12.234
THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION TO THE

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.869
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE THAT I THINK

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:16.071
IS A LITTLE TROUBLING TO ME --

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:17.572
I UNDERSTAND POLITICALLY WHY

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:18.941
IT'S IN THE FEDERAL ONE BUT I'M

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:19.975
NOT SURE WHAT WE WOULD DO IN

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:21.109
CALIFORNIA.

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.778
AND WHICH IS ALSO SAYING THAT IF

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:24.546
YOU'RE IN A HEALTH CARE SHARING

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:26.181
MINISTRY AND UNFORTUNATELY --

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:28.583
THOSE PRODUCTS IT'S ONE THING IF

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:29.952
IT'S REALLY WITHIN THE CHURCH I

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:30.752
THINK THERE'S STILL SOME SHOWERS

01:16:30.819 --> 01:16:31.820
BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY'RE NOT

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:32.387
ACTUALLY INTERESTING UP THIS

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:33.288
FOLLOWS.

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:36.124
THE PRESENTATION BY THE PART

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:38.026
MANAGE HEALTHCARE WHICH IS THE

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:39.728
POINTED OUT NAY EMPHASIZES THE

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:41.196
IMPORTANCE OF BEING SHARED PLANS

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:41.863
THERE WHEN YOU NEED IT I THINK

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:43.899
THAT'S ONE THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:16:43.966 --> 01:16:44.666
COMPONENTS OF THE ACA.

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:46.568
YEAH WE PUT A LOT OF REGULATIONS

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:47.736
OF PLANS TO BE SURE THAT IT'S

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:49.204
THERE WHEN YOU NEED IT AND WE

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.673
SEE THE EXCEPTION IS YOU CAN BE

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.608
ESSENTIALLY IN A FORM OF WHILE

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:54.376
ON A CALL COVERAGE OR NOT.

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:59.915
IT'S NOT REALLY COVERAGE BUT THE

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:02.684
PROBLEM IS IS RESERVE

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:04.119
REQUIREMENTS THEY DON'T HAVE TO

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:07.689
HAVE NETWORKS IT CETERA AND AND

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:09.091
I UNDERSTAND POLITICALLY WIFE

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:10.292
AND FEDERAL LEVEL THAT'S AN

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:12.027
EXCEPTION I'M NOT SURE WHY WE

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:14.529
WOULD HAVE THAT EXCEPTION AND IT

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:16.064
IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I THINK

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.532
IT'S UNFORTUNATE IT'S A LOOPHOLE.

01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:19.368
AND UNFORTUNATELY WE SEE PEOPLE

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:20.802
GOING ON MARKETING THEM SO

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:22.671
BEYOND JUST ANY PARTICULAR

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:24.172
CONGREGATION SO --

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:25.574
SO CAN YOU PERHAPS --

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.744
SPEAK TO THE THAT PARTICULAR

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:31.013
ISSUE.

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:33.181
SURE AND AGAIN I THINK.

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:34.049
IN DROUGHT IN THIS TRAILER BILL

01:17:34.116 --> 01:17:35.350
WE TRIED TO HE WAS CLOSELY AS

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:37.452
POSSIBLE TO THE FEDERAL STATUTE

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:38.854
THAT EXIST TODAY I THINK

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.555
ADMINISTRATIVELY IT'S SIMPLER

01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:41.556
FOR US.

01:17:41.623 --> 01:17:42.791
TO IMPLEMENT A PROPOSAL THAT

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:44.626
BEGINS CHAIR ONE TWENTY TWENTY

01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:45.627
FOLLOWING THE FRAMEWORK THAT'S

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:47.529
ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED --

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:48.864
WE DEFINITELY HEAR CONCERNS ARE

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:49.898
HAPPY TO TAKE HIM BACK AGAINST

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:50.899
THEIR OWN BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:52.601
ARE INTENT INTO DRAFTING THIS

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:53.802
PROPOSAL WAS.

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:55.771
TO KIND OF MATCH AS CLOSELY WHAT

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:56.705
IS CURRENTLY IN PLACE AT THE

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:58.707
FEDERAL LEVEL AND NOT KIND OF

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:00.342
RELITIGATE SO THOSE ISSUES THAT

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:01.076
HAVE BEEN BUILT INTO THAT LAW

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:02.277
BUT AGAIN HAPPY.

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:04.212
TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS OKAY SO

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:08.116
I THINK AT A MINIMUM.

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:09.451
LOS WAS A I THINK IT'S BY BETTER

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.619
OFF OF WE DON'T BUY HEAR WHAT

01:18:10.685 --> 01:18:11.686
YOU'RE SAYING ANDERSON INDUSTRY

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:13.188
COMPLEX THE AT THE STATE MINIMUM

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:14.689
WE NEED TO MONITOR THIS AND IF

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:16.458
PEOPLE GOING AROUND MARKETING.

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:20.028
THESE THINGS AND BASICALLY

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:23.999
TURNING IS SO --

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:24.933
AND DID MISTER COMPLEX TO MAKE

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.001
HIM WITH IT.

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:27.335
THE OTHER --

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:29.438
I GUESS EXCEPTION WHICH IS LESS

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:30.772
TROUBLESOME --

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:32.441
IS -- AND IT

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:34.309
AND CERTAINLY OPEN TO IS --

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:37.179
I THINK IF YOU BELONG TO CERTAIN --

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:39.314
RELIGIOUS GROUPS SO I THINK

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:40.715
CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST BUT I THINK

01:18:40.782 --> 01:18:41.883
FOR EXAMPLE CITY MASSACHUSETTS

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:43.985
DAM PERSIAN SAYING THAT FINE BUT

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.754
IF YOU ACTUALLY END UP USING.

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:47.089
IT OUT WHICH BASICALLY WOULD

01:18:47.155 --> 01:18:48.190
INDICATE.

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:49.758
WELL IF YOU ACTUALLY ARE PERMITS

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:51.460
ARE TO SAYS YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN

01:18:51.526 --> 01:18:52.327
HEALTH CARE BUT THEN YOU

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:53.428
ACTUALLY END UP USING HEALTHCARE

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:56.098
WELL THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:57.165
REQUIRED COVERAGE BECAUSE

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:58.834
ULTIMATELY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.735
EVERYONE IS THE UNINSURED AND

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:01.303
THAT'S WHAT WE'LL GET MORE

01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:02.304
PEOPLE COVERAGE.

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:04.272
WE STILL PAY FOR ITS JUST THE

01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:06.641
GETS SUBSIDIZED ANOTHER WAY SO --

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:08.477
SO PERHAPS AND SOME FINE WITH

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:10.178
THAT FEDERAL PART BE IN THERE

01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:11.847
BUT MAY THINK ABOUT PROVISION OF

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:13.248
THAT SOMETHING LIKE WHAT

01:19:13.315 --> 01:19:14.082
MASSACHUSETTS DID SOME STUFF

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:15.851
THROW THAT OUT THERE.

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:17.686
OKAY SO LET'S MOVING ASIDE OFTEN

01:19:17.752 --> 01:19:19.121
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN TERMS

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:21.189
OF THE SUBSIDIES I I KNOW THAT --

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:25.961
AND I APPRECIATE DAILY --

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:28.597
BRING THIS UP TO AND LEARN ABOUT

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:29.631
THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:32.300
SUBSIDIES VARYING FROM YEAR TO

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:32.801
YEAR.

01:19:32.868 --> 01:19:35.036
RIGHT AND PEOPLE NOT ACTUALLY BE

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:35.704
ABLE TO PREDICT WHAT'S GOING TO

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:38.406
BE BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON YOU

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:39.207
KNOW I MEAN PEOPLE OF ALL OUR

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:40.275
BUDGET THAT CLOSELY.

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:41.977
AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT GONNA

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:44.779
KNOW HOW MUCH AND IT IN BECAUSE

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:46.114
ACTUALLY IS IS THAT THE THE

01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:47.282
COLLECTOR TOBACCO TAX I MEAN

01:19:47.349 --> 01:19:48.783
ULTIMATELY ACTUALLY WOULD I'D BE

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:50.919
THRILLED IF THE PENALTY WAS ZERO

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:52.020
THEY AT ME AND THAT WE HAVE

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.755
EVERYONE SIGNED UP RIGHT I MEAN

01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:54.789
THAT THAT THAT.

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:56.958
THAT WOULD BE THAT THE WONDERFUL --

01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:59.728
AND SO THE CHALLENGE THEN IS IS

01:19:59.794 --> 01:20:01.563
THAT I COULD IMAGINE THAT WILL

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:04.299
HAPPEN IS YOU WE SET FIVE

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:05.267
HUNDRED MILLION WE SAID A

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.701
SUBSIDY A CERTAIN LEVEL.

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:08.737
AND ACTUALLY PEOPLE SAY OKAY

01:20:08.803 --> 01:20:10.272
THAT'S OF THE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD

01:20:10.338 --> 01:20:13.975
IT'S ON A BY HEALTH INSURANCE

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:15.844
RIGHT PENALTY WILL GO DOWN.

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:16.945
RIGHT BECAUSE THE CELL THE RATES

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:17.946
OF MORE PEOPLE SIGN UP.

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:18.947
THE NEXT YEAR I HAVE THIS OF

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:20.615
PEOPLE SIGN UP AND NOW WE HAVE A

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:21.483
SMALLER POOL AND WE SAID WELL

01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:22.083
NOW YOUR SUBSIDY SHRINKING AND

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:22.751
THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE

01:20:22.817 --> 01:20:25.420
GOING WELL THE SUBSIDIES LESS

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:27.122
I'M GONNA TAKE THE PENALTY AGAIN.

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.756
AND SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS UP

01:20:27.822 --> 01:20:28.757
AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN AND

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:30.759
PEOPLE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:20:30.825 --> 01:20:32.494
TO PREDICT IN GAME THIS IS THEY

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:33.228
ARE THAT IT'S AN GAMES ISM

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:34.329
SURVEY RATED THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:35.063
MAKE FINANCIAL DECISIONS FOR

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:35.931
THEMSELVES.

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:39.834
AND SO I DO THINK THAT THAT

01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:41.603
THAT'S REALLY.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.004
THAT'S GOING TO CREATE SOME --

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:44.206
BONELLI INSTABILITYIT MAY

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:45.407
ACTUALLY CREATE THIS TRUST I

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:46.841
MEAN TRUST IS A REAL IMPORTANT

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:48.944
PART ABOUT HEALTHCARE RIGHT.

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:49.911
AND SO WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:50.278
THIS.

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:51.446
SO I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT HAVING

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:54.382
THAT KIND IT'S GOING TO BE

01:20:54.449 --> 01:20:55.584
REALLY PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS HOW

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.619
DO WE COMMUNICATE TO PEOPLE

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:58.920
RIGHT SO I YEAH THIS WAS.

01:20:58.987 --> 01:20:59.955
THE GOVERNOR'S GOING OUT THERE

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:01.590
SAYING WE ARE BOTH GONE REQUIRE

01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:03.425
YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE BUT

01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:03.892
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:04.492
AFFORDABLE.

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:05.460
BUT WE CAN'T TELL YOU HOW

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:06.728
AFFORDABLE IT'S GOING TO BE

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:07.829
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:08.830
MONEY'S GOING TO COME IN FROM

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:11.433
YEAR TO YEAR RIGHT.

01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:12.701
ANY OF YOU HOW HOW HOW MUCH LEAD

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:14.236
TIME REAL WARM PEOPLE I'LL TELL

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:15.804
YOU RIGHT NOW WE'RE SITTING

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:17.439
THERE GOING WELL YOU KNOW.

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:19.174
WORDS WILL THE REASON WE DO MAY

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:20.642
REVISE AS WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:22.577
MONEY HE IS GOING TO HAPPEN

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:23.445
UNTIL IF SO HOW MUCH LEAD TIME

01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:25.513
GIVE GIVE PEOPLE TO PLAN WHEN

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:29.451
THEY PURCHASE RATE AND AND THEN

01:21:29.517 --> 01:21:30.218
WHAT HAPPENS --

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:32.854
WOOD.

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:34.856
SO ANYWAY THE KEY CAN YOU.

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:35.423
HAPPY TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:36.057
QUESTIONS SO WE HAVE DEFINITELY

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:38.526
HEARD THOSE CONCERNS I THINK THE

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:39.294
FIRST THING TO NOTE THAT WE'RE

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:40.161
PROPOSING A SUBSIDY PROGRAM TO

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:42.030
SINCE THE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:42.530
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THREE

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:42.897
COVERAGE YEARS.

01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:44.933
AGAIN AS MENTIONED IN MY

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.368
PRESENTATION I THINK THE INTENT.

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:47.702
IS TO CALL UPON THE FEDERAL

01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:49.337
GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN AND HELP

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:50.705
CALIFORNIANS OTHER STATES

01:21:50.772 --> 01:21:51.706
ADDRESS THESE LARGER

01:21:51.773 --> 01:21:55.010
AFFORDABILITY QUESTIONS THAT MAY

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:59.014
TAKE ANOTHER ELECTION --

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.148
RELATED TO THE VOLATILITY OF THE

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:01.650
REVENUE ESTIMATES I THINK FOR

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:03.118
THIS FIRST YEAR IT'S GOING TO BE --

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:04.886
VERY CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:06.354
FRANCHISE TAX OARD AND COVERED

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:08.023
CALIFORNIA AND FINANCING THIS

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:08.957
BUDGET COMMITTEES TO KIND OF

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:10.425
SETTLE ON THE REVENUE NUMBER AND

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:11.626
I DON'T THINK THAT NUMBER WILL

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.228
BE ADJUSTED IN THE FIRST TWO

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:14.963
YEARS BECAUSE OUR ADDITIONAL

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:16.264
INFORMATION IS NOT GONNA COME IN.

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:19.601
UNTIL APRIL.

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:20.235
TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF WHICH WILL

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:21.536
LIKELY HAVE A SO WILL LIKELY

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:22.304
HAVE A SIMILAR REVENUE

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:23.571
PROJECTION FOR THE FIRST AND

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:25.573
SECOND YEAR OF THE PROPOSED

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.141
PROGRAM [inaudible]

01:22:26.207 --> 01:22:28.810
OF AGAIN THE EFFECTS OF THAT MAY

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:29.844
BE FELT IN THE THIRD YEAR OF THE

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:31.279
PROPOSED COVERAGE YEARS BUT

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:33.515
AGAIN WOULD NOTE THAT.

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:35.250
THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL IS TO

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:36.685
MAKE COVERAGE MORE FORMAL TO THE

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:38.453
EXTENT POSSIBLE.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.622
WHILE ALSO IMPLEMENTING THIS BUT

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:41.790
BY WILD TYING IN THE SCHOOLS HIS

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:42.290
PENALTY REVENUE.

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:44.459
IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR BROADER

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:45.060
BUDGET DISCUSSIONS [inaudible]

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:49.130
I AND THAT WE HAVE IN THIS

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:51.499
COMMITTEE PROCESS THESE.

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:53.234
AND CAN YOU JUST ALSO CLARIFY

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:54.769
UNDERSTAND THE PART THE PROPOSAL

01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:56.504
ALSO IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO

01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:58.239
GUESTS RATE A LITTLE BIT IN THE

01:22:58.306 --> 01:22:59.107
BEGINNING.

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:00.375
DURING A PROJECT X. AMOUNT OF

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:02.277
DEAL FIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:03.478
OR SOME AMOUNT OF MONEY.

01:23:03.545 --> 01:23:05.280
AND IF IT TURNS OUT WHAT WE

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:08.049
COLLECT IN THE PENALTY IS NOT AS

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:10.385
MUCH AS WE EXPECT ARE WE PLAYING

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:12.821
TO THE AND SUBS IT FILL THAT IN

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:14.689
WITH GENERAL FUND OR DRAW DOWN

01:23:14.756 --> 01:23:16.191
IN FUTURE YEARS NOW WE HAVE EVEN

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:20.061
SMALLER PULL IN THE FUTURE YEAR.

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:22.864
TO PROVIDE SO WHAT IS THE THE

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:23.298
WHY IS.

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.700
THE AMOUNT SPECIFIED FOR EACH

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:26.901
COVERAGE YOUR WOULD BE.

01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:28.069
DEBATE IN NEGOTIATING THESE

01:23:28.136 --> 01:23:29.204
BUDGET COMMITTEE IS COVERED

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:30.705
CALIFORNIA RCEIVE THAT NUMBER.

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:31.940
IN JUNE WHEN THE BUDGET IS

01:23:32.006 --> 01:23:32.707
PASSED AND THEY WILL DESIGN

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:34.576
THEIR SUBSIDY PROGRAM BASED ON

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:36.111
THE NUMBER AND THAT.

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:36.911
WILL INFORM THE SUBSIDIES

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:38.279
AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.014
PURCHASE COVERAGE DURING OPEN

01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:41.716
ENROLLMENT OCTOBER TO JANUARY.

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:43.218
ONCE THOSE INDIVIDUAL SET THEIR

01:23:43.284 --> 01:23:44.819
SUBSIDY AMOUNT IS NOT OUR INTENT

01:23:44.886 --> 01:23:45.653
THAT THAT AMOUNT FOR THAT

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.155
COVERAGE YOU'RE BE ADJUSTED

01:23:47.222 --> 01:23:48.189
DOWNWARD UPWARD.

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:50.625
HOWEVER YOU ARE CORRECT THAT IF

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:50.925
[inaudible]

01:23:50.992 --> 01:23:53.728
THE PROGRAMS ARE OVER EXTENDED

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:55.730
IN THAT COVERAGE HERE BECAUSE WE

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:55.964
DO NOT.

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:59.534
WE UNDERESTIMATED REVENUES --

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.169
UNDERESTIMATE EXPANSIONS WE

01:24:01.236 --> 01:24:02.737
WOULD LIKE THE PROPOSED TO

01:24:02.804 --> 01:24:04.372
REDUCE THE SUBSEQUENT FUNDING

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:06.174
AMOUNT AND THE NEXT YEAR BASED

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:07.609
OFF THOSE ACTUAL THAT WE'VE

01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:10.211
RECEIVED OKAY SO --

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:12.414
SO AGAIN I AM FIRST OF ALL I A

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.382
AGREE IN SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:16.351
WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT CHANGE

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:17.752
IT WITHIN THE PLAN YEAR.

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.287
WHY I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SORRY I

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:20.188
WAS A PHYSICS MADE BY A PHYSICS

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:21.856
MAJOR SO --

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:23.958
SO WHAT I SEE IS A ESSENTIALLY

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:25.527
CREATING THIS OR WAVE A FACT

01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:27.562
BECAUSE WILL HAPPEN IS IS THAT.

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:28.696
WE DELIVERY TALKING ABOUT

01:24:28.763 --> 01:24:29.931
PERTURBATIONS IN THE SYSTEM

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:31.699
WHERE OKAY WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS

01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:33.334
IS THAT WE PROVIDE A SUBSIDY

01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:34.936
MORE PEOPLE HOPEFULLY I MEAN

01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:36.938
THAT'S THE INTENT.

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:38.540
ARE ABLE TO SIGN OFF.

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:40.775
THAT IS THE PENALTY GOES DOWN.

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:41.876
I AND WE OVER GUESS HOW MUCH

01:24:41.943 --> 01:24:42.911
AGAIN THE PENALTY THAT WILL

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:44.679
HAPPEN IS NOW ONLY OF COURSE

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:46.080
WILL THE SUB TO GO DOWN THE

01:24:46.147 --> 01:24:47.115
FOLLOWING YEAR EVERY ESSAY WILL

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:47.582
NOW GOING.

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:49.083
BRING BACK SOME OF THAT MONEY TO

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:50.885
FILL IN THE BACK FILL THAT POOL

01:24:50.952 --> 01:24:52.954
GETS EVEN SMALLER NOW THAT

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:54.689
SUBSIDY DROPS EVEN MORE.

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.391
AND THEN WILL HAPPEN IS THAT I

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:57.425
APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE NOT A

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:58.526
CHANGE WITHIN YOUR BILL WHEN

01:24:58.593 --> 01:24:59.160
THEY LOOK AT THAT YEAR TING I

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:00.428
LIKE WAIT A MINUTE WHAT HAPPENED

01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:02.697
TO THE SUBSIDY RIGHT AND I WAS

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:03.965
PLANNING ON BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:05.767
I'VE GOT RIGHT NOW.

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:06.434
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PLAN I HAVE

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:07.435
NOW?

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:08.837
I'D LIKE TO KEEP IT BUT NOW

01:25:08.903 --> 01:25:09.404
YOU'RE TELLING ME THE ONLY

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:12.474
ALTERNATIVE I HAVE A SOMETHING

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.074
THAT'S GOING TO BE [inaudible]

01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:14.242
A LOT.

01:25:14.309 --> 01:25:16.177
LESS MANAGEABLE BECAUSE THE

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:17.679
SUBSIDIES ARE MUCH LESS RIGHT.

01:25:17.745 --> 01:25:19.180
AND I THINK I THINK TO BE A LOT

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:20.982
OF PEOPLE BE VERY CONCERNED

01:25:21.049 --> 01:25:23.551
ABOUT THAT RIGHT MEAN IT THE S.

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:23.918
SO.

01:25:23.985 --> 01:25:25.987
I'M NOT SURE WE'RE SENDING THE

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:29.090
RIGHT MESSAGE THEN AND AND I'M

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:30.391
AFRAID THAT ACTUALLY BY.

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:31.125
SAYING THAT WE'RE GOING TO THEN

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:32.427
TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM A FUTURE

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:34.696
YEAR.

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.464
WE'RE ACTUALLY MAGNIFYING THIS

01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:39.501
EFFECT RIGHT SO --

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:41.569
NOW I I THINK ALL TOGETHER I

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:42.804
WOULD THINK OF A MORE STABLE

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:45.373
FUNDING BASE FUNDING SOURCE SO

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.841
LET'S PUT THAT ASIDE FOR JUST A

01:25:46.908 --> 01:25:48.142
MOMENT WHEN WE COME BACK TO THAT.

01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:52.247
BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY IS THAT WE

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:55.149
WOULD MAKE A HELL OF BEST GAS

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:56.584
BUT IT TURNS OUT WE GOT CLOUD

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:57.685
BACK.

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:58.920
THAT'S GOING TO BY DESIGN

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.222
MAGNIFIED THE VERY PROBLEM THAT

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:02.657
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO WE'RE

01:26:02.724 --> 01:26:04.459
COMPOUNDING IT BY SAYING THAT

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:05.760
NOT ONLY OF COURSE WE'RE GOING

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.395
TO BASE IT ON WHAT THE PENALTY'S

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:07.996
GOING TO BE.

01:26:08.062 --> 01:26:09.797
WE'RE THEN GOING TO IF WE GUESS

01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:11.933
WRONG AND WE OVER ESTIMATED

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.201
WE'RE GONNA TAKE EVEN MORE MONEY

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:14.369
FROM THE FUTURE YEAR AND

01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:16.838
THEREFORE SHRINK THE SUBS EVEN

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:17.038
MORE.

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:18.540
AND I THINK THE THE RESPONSE

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:19.574
FROM PEOPLE ARE PURCHASING

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:20.842
INSURANCE IS GOING TO BE WELL

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:22.844
I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO BUY

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:23.912
SOMETHING WHERE I CAN'T GET

01:26:23.978 --> 01:26:24.312
THERE.

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:25.613
I MEAN I GUESS PEOPLE CANNELLA

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.148
BY THIS YEAR WILL BY NEXT YEAR

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:28.650
BY THE END FOLLOWING YEAR BUT I

01:26:28.716 --> 01:26:30.885
I JUST THINK THAT --

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:33.254
THAT INVOLVED THAT VOLATILITY IS

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:36.991
GOING TO UNDERMINES PEOPLE'S.

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:38.626
DESIRE TO LOSE WELL THAT'S FOR

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:40.128
THIS WAY COVER CALIFORNIA ANSWER

01:26:40.194 --> 01:26:41.195
THIS U AND A ONE THE CHALLENGES

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:42.964
BEEN COVERED CALIFORNIA IS IS

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.599
THAT -- IF

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:46.200
YOU ACTUALLY TRIED AND BOOKED

01:26:46.267 --> 01:26:47.068
EACH YEAR IS IT JUST RENEWED

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:48.736
YOUR SAME PLAN AND LOOKED AT THE

01:26:48.803 --> 01:26:49.971
PREMIUMS AND WE HAVE

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:51.339
STANDARDIZED BENEFITS THAT YOU

01:26:51.406 --> 01:26:53.107
COULD ACTUALLY THE V. ACTUALLY

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:55.176
THE AMOUNT THAT THE PLAN COSTS

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:56.911
EACH YEAR ACTUALLY DOESN'T GO UP.

01:26:56.978 --> 01:26:58.613
QUITE AS MUCH RIGHT BUT ACTUALLY

01:26:58.680 --> 01:26:59.881
INTERESTING PEOPLE COMPLAIN

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:01.316
ABOUT HOW FAST THE PLAN GOES UP

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:02.684
IS BECAUSE THEY GENERALLY WE

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:04.152
ACTUALLY TRY TO STICK TO THE

01:27:04.218 --> 01:27:05.987
SAME PLAN THEY DON'T ALWAYS SHOP

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:08.122
AGAIN THEY SERVE THE SHOP THE

01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:08.923
FIRST YEAR.

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.691
AND THEN THEY KIND OF AND THEY

01:27:09.757 --> 01:27:11.759
GO WELL LOOK MY PLAN WHAT BUT

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.094
GUESS WHAT THERE'S ANOTHER

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:13.861
PLANTS A LITTLE CHEAPER OH OH

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:16.097
WELL I DIDN'T REALLY AND HOW CAN

01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:17.365
THAT IT'S RIGHT IS THAT

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:18.466
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE END UP

01:27:18.533 --> 01:27:19.233
DOING A LOT.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.902
THE THERE ARE DYNAMICS AND SO

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:22.770
THE TAX CREDITS TIED TO THE

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:23.605
SECOND LOS COSTS OVER PEOPLE

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:24.973
OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW THAT SO

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:26.874
THEY THEY FEEL THE DYNAMICS OF

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:29.477
THEIR PLANS DISTANCE GOING UP OR

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:31.045
DOWN RELATIVE TO THAT SECOND LOS

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:33.047
COSTS OVER AND THEN IT IT CAUSES

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:41.489
THEM TO RETHINK AND SHOP.

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:43.992
OKAY SO BUT BY A OF THE BEING

01:27:44.058 --> 01:27:46.160
FAIRLY.

01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:47.662
WE'RE NAMING CONSTRAINING IT TO

01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:48.429
A CERTAIN.

01:27:48.496 --> 01:27:50.531
WINDOW SO THAT LEAST SO WHAT WHO

01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:51.666
KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED THIS OF

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.067
THESE GOING TO BE CUT IN HALF.

01:27:53.134 --> 01:27:54.736
IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN TWO THIRDS

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:57.639
IS A TO COME 210% I MEAN IF IT'S

01:27:57.705 --> 01:27:58.840
SMALL OKAY.

01:27:58.906 --> 01:28:00.475
BUT IT'S YEAR TO YEAR BUT IT'S A

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:04.445
BIG DROP YOU KNOW A BIG IS.

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:05.113
NOW OF COURSE TO THE OUTSIDE OF

01:28:05.179 --> 01:28:07.482
THE HOLDER BUT 25% 33% THAT

01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:09.317
PEOPLE MIGHT GO WELL WHAT'S

01:28:09.384 --> 01:28:10.218
GOING ON HERE.

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:15.590
RIGHT SO.

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:19.360
I DEFINITELY HERE CONCERNED WE

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:19.961
WOULD JUST KNOW THAT THIS IS

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:21.162
PROPOSING TO BUILD UPON THE

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.763
EXISTING FEDERAL FRAMEWORK AND

01:28:21.829 --> 01:28:22.563
THOSE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES WOULD

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:23.164
STILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE

01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:24.265
CONSUMERS WHO ARE PURCHASING

01:28:24.332 --> 01:28:25.099
COVERAGE ON THE HEALTHCARE

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:26.000
MARKET.

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:27.802
BUT AGAIN NO YOU CONCERNING HAVE

01:28:27.869 --> 01:28:29.470
TO TAKE IT BACK.

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:31.472
OKAY SO --

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:32.874
CAN I GET NOW I'M GONNA GO AND

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.275
MY PART TO FOR SIDE SO WHAT

01:28:34.342 --> 01:28:37.011
ABOUT A MORE STABLE FUNDING BASE --

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:38.946
SO.

01:28:39.013 --> 01:28:40.715
AND THEN AGAIN I UNDERSTAND --

01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:42.884
YOU YOU PRIDE DON'T HAVE THE

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:43.951
AUTHORITY TO IT BUT SINCE YOU

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:46.754
GOT BRING STUFF BACK --

01:28:46.821 --> 01:28:49.257
SO SO FIRST FIRST OF ALL THIS

01:28:49.323 --> 01:28:50.191
THE SUMP THE SON AND WE'VE WE'VE

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:51.159
WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS ACTUALLY WE

01:28:51.225 --> 01:28:52.527
HAD OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:53.795
WHAT WAS THE JOINT.

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:55.296
NOT ONLY HEALTH COMMITTEES BUT

01:28:55.363 --> 01:28:55.863
BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES CAME

01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:56.898
TOGETHER.

01:28:56.964 --> 01:29:00.968
AND AND SO CERTAINLY YOU KNOW

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:03.071
FIVE HUNDRED DOESN'T.

01:29:03.137 --> 01:29:04.372
YEAH ON TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:05.573
SUBSIDY WE SAW THE REPORT FROM

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.108
CURRENT CALIFORNIA I'D THINK IT

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:08.509
SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT MORE SUB THAT

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:10.445
IF -- AND

01:29:10.511 --> 01:29:14.315
ALSO MORTARS TABLE AS WELL AND

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:15.583
SO WAIT THEY THINK WHEN THE

01:29:15.650 --> 01:29:19.554
THINGS WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER --

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.055
AND CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT --

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:22.590
IT IS THE LEGISLATURE PATENT

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:24.425
THAT PASSES THE BUDGET IN THE

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:25.626
GOVERNOR SIDES FOR SIGN OR NOT

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:26.627
BUT I'M GONNA BUT WE WANT TO

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:28.162
WORK WITH YOU --

01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:29.731
IS AND I APPRECIATE YOU IS IS

01:29:29.797 --> 01:29:32.233
MAYBE PERHAPS LOOKING AT THE MCO

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.702
TAX RATE WHICH I'VE.

01:29:34.769 --> 01:29:36.337
READ THAT THE GOVERNOR DECIDED

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:40.608
THE LEAST IN THIS IN THE GENERAL

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:42.610
BUDGET PROPOSAL NOT.

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:43.644
TO RENEW AND YOU KNOW WE'LL TRY

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:44.879
TO HAVE SOME DISCUSSION LATER ON

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:46.147
ABOUT THE ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:48.516
OF CONTINUING ED BUT YOU KNOW I

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:50.151
I IN SOME SENSES IN PRINCIPLE

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:52.253
RIGHT IT'S A TAX ON ALL MANAGED

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.054
CARE ORGANIZATION.

01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:55.223
ALL PLANS RIGHT AND SO WE'RE

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:56.424
DOING SUBSIDY THROUGH CAR

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:58.793
CALIFORNIA EVERY PLAN HAS AN

01:29:58.860 --> 01:29:59.894
OPPORTUNITY FOR MOST PART TO

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:00.795
PARTICIPATE.

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:02.930
RIGHT NOW AS WELL SO IT SORT OF

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:04.999
BATCHES AND MAKES SOME SENSE

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:06.067
THERE AND ALSO COOL HELD A STRAW

01:30:06.134 --> 01:30:07.201
DOUBTS MORE MONEY FOR MEDI CAL

01:30:07.268 --> 01:30:08.703
PROGRAM INCLUDING OUR MEDICAL

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:12.240
EXPANSION --

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:14.976
BUT I THINK THAT CERTAINLY I

01:30:15.042 --> 01:30:17.612
REVENUE MAKES SENSE BUT THAT

01:30:17.678 --> 01:30:20.281
BEING THE PRIMARY ARE TYING THE

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:21.649
ENTIRE SUBSIDY TO THAT.

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:24.152
I WOULD SAVE ALL TAL INCOME

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:25.753
SOURCE UNTIL IT'S PROVEN AS YOU

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:28.389
CAN -- UNTIL

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:29.524
IT WAS IMPROVE IS NOT GONNA BE

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:30.892
SO VOLATILE --

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:33.094
I THINK IS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:35.196
STRATEGY WE WANT PEOPLE WHEN

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:36.964
THEY SEE THEIR PLAN WHEN WE SEE

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:37.565
THEM ON EIGHT WHEN GOVERNOR

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:38.833
NEWSOME GOES AND ANNOUNCES AND

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:40.334
SAYS LOOK YOU KNOW WE ARE TAKING

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:41.803
IT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:43.371
THING HAPPEN NOW RIGHT I PROMISE

01:30:43.437 --> 01:30:43.638
THIS IS.

01:30:43.704 --> 01:30:45.239
THE BEGIN MY TERM WE'RE GONNA

01:30:45.306 --> 01:30:46.207
MAKE THIS THING HAPPEN THERE ARE

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:50.244
PEOPLE THE NEXT THE FOLLOWING

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:51.112
YEAR GOING WHEN WHAT HAPPENED.

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:52.046
RIGHT ARE YOU PULLING BACK FROM

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:53.414
THIS BECAUSE WE'VE TIED THIS

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:55.116
ENTIRELY --

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:57.285
TOO SO --

01:30:57.351 --> 01:30:58.786
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.

01:30:58.853 --> 01:30:59.921
I KNOW YOU CAN'T SAY YES OR NO

01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:01.455
RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY

01:31:01.522 --> 01:31:03.291
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS SHOWN

01:31:03.357 --> 01:31:05.726
THE MCO TAX AT THIS TIME BUT

01:31:05.793 --> 01:31:08.629
AGAIN WE WILL TAKE IT BACK.

01:31:08.696 --> 01:31:09.964
THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S ALL I CAN

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:12.033
ASK RIGHT NOW.

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:13.968
BUT IN NAY WILL BE VOTING ON

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:14.535
STUFF SO.

01:31:14.602 --> 01:31:17.271
OKAY -- IT'S

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:20.741
OTHER ISSUES AND AND THEN I SEE

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:22.677
I CAN YOU ADDRESS THE THE LA --

01:31:22.743 --> 01:31:25.046
BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE AROUND TAX

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:27.081
CREDIT VERSES.

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:28.749
THAT WAS IT THE ON GOING TO YOU

01:31:28.816 --> 01:31:30.585
CAN REPEAT THAT.

01:31:30.651 --> 01:31:31.953
SURE IT'S IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:33.054
THAT IN OTHER STATES THE

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.622
SUBSIDIES PROVIDED TO THE

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:36.057
INSURER SIMILAR TO AN ADVANCED

01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:38.025
CREDIT BUT THERE'S NO TRUE UP AT

01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:40.127
THE END THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:42.263
INSTEAD IT'S ADJUSTED AS THE

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:44.498
YEAR GOES ON FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:31:44.565 --> 01:31:45.733
PLAN MIGHT GET SOME INFORMATION

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.500
OR COVER CALIFORNIA.

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:47.802
MY GET SOME INFORMATION ABOUT

01:31:47.869 --> 01:31:49.337
CHANGES IN INCOME THEY WOULD

01:31:49.403 --> 01:31:51.205
ADJUST THE SUBSIDY PROSPECTIVELY

01:31:51.272 --> 01:31:52.473
AND THAT WOULD SORT OF BE THE

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.175
END OF THE STORY SO IT'S IT'S

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:56.210
BOUNCING BETWEEN --

01:31:56.277 --> 01:31:59.380
PER MENTALITY VERSUS SIMPLICITY

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:00.514
THE WOULD BE GOOD TO TALK ABOUT

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:01.749
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE THAT THE

01:32:01.816 --> 01:32:05.786
TRADE OFF THEIR OKAY AND THE

01:32:05.853 --> 01:32:07.622
SPELL YOU HAVE AND DOES SOME.

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:08.589
YELLING IS ABOUT THAT AND WE'LL

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:10.291
LET FINANCE ALSO WHAT THEY THINK

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:13.261
THE TRADE OFFS OR SO ONE OF THE

01:32:13.327 --> 01:32:14.695
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS MADE

01:32:14.762 --> 01:32:16.530
PEOPLE FRUSTRATED WITH THE

01:32:16.597 --> 01:32:17.465
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:19.100
RECONCILIATION.

01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:20.635
IT'S THAT IF YOU DON'T KILL SURE

01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:23.104
INCOME CORRECTLY AND I FOR ONE

01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:24.272

01:32:30.111 --> 01:32:32.213
IF YOU GET A GAS INCORRECTLY

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.248
THEN YOU HAVE WHAT IS USUALLY

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:35.383
FOR A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:37.718
UNHAPPY SURPRISE AT TAX TIME.

01:32:37.785 --> 01:32:39.487
PEOPLE TEND TO UNDERESTIMATE

01:32:39.553 --> 01:32:40.721
THEIR INCOME RISES IN

01:32:40.788 --> 01:32:43.024
OVERESTIMATED SO RATHER THAN

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:45.359
CALIFORNIA THERE'S MUCH TO

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:46.294
COMMEND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.595
I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS WE'RE

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:48.996
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT BUT

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:50.431
CALIFORNIA HAS CONSISTENTLY

01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:52.466
IMPROVED ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE

01:32:52.533 --> 01:32:53.100
ACT.

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:54.468
IN THIS WOULD BE AN AREA WHERE

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:55.736
WE WOULD HOPE WE WOULD IMPROVE

01:32:55.803 --> 01:32:57.605
RATHER THAN REPLICATE SOMETHING

01:32:57.672 --> 01:32:58.639
THAT WAS.

01:32:58.706 --> 01:33:00.341
AFTER ALL DESIGNED TO THE U. S.

THE DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT

01:33:13.821 --> 01:33:15.690

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:22.063

01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:24.699
CLOSELY TO THIS FOUNDATION

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:26.767
THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE --

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:29.170
HAVING THE ABILITY TO RECONCILE

01:33:29.236 --> 01:33:29.737
IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO MAKE

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:30.404
SURE THAT.

01:33:30.471 --> 01:33:31.205

SUBSIDY PROGRAM.

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:36.344
I THINK ADMINISTRATIVELY THERE'S

01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:37.511
ALSO QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO

01:33:37.578 --> 01:33:39.280
WORK THROUGH REGARDING WHETHER

01:33:39.347 --> 01:33:41.048
OR NOT COVER CALIFORNIA WOULD BE

01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:43.084
ABLE TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS.

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:43.718
MONTHLY THROUGHOUT THE COVERAGE

01:33:43.784 --> 01:33:46.387
HERE.

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:47.121
ANY COMMENTS FROM COVER

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:48.222
CALIFORNIA.

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:49.190
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WERE READY

01:33:49.256 --> 01:33:50.458
TO WORK CLOSELY ON THIS WE DO DO

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:52.426
THIS TODAY THROUGH THE FEDERAL

01:33:52.493 --> 01:33:54.462
SYSTEM OBVIOUSLY --

01:33:54.528 --> 01:33:55.997
AT CONSUMERS ARE ALLOWED TO

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:57.231
APPLY FOR SUBSIDIES BASED ON A

01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:58.632
PROJECTED ANNUAL INCOME SO

01:33:58.699 --> 01:33:59.834
TRIMMING UP AT THE END OF THE

YEAR TO WHERE THE DOLLARS LAND

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:03.504
IS.

01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:04.138
WHY THAT HAPPENS AT THE FEDERAL

01:34:04.205 --> 01:34:04.872
LEVEL?

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:07.775
OKAY AND THEN FINALLY A I THINK

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:09.610
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT --

01:34:09.677 --> 01:34:11.612
IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSAL --

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:14.181
SO FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO END UP.

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:16.417
HAVING TO PAY THE PENALTY --

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:18.686
WE WOULD LIKE TO BE SURE THAT

01:34:18.753 --> 01:34:20.354
THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF THEIR

01:34:20.421 --> 01:34:22.390
VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO GET

01:34:22.456 --> 01:34:23.024
ENROLLED SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:24.759
PAY THE PENALTY --

01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:26.894
THAT INCLUDES PERHAPS PEOPLE WHO

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:29.030
MAY EVEN QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL WE

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.197
WILL BE SURE TO SIGN UP.

01:34:30.264 --> 01:34:32.500
RIGHT THERE'S NO COST THAT TO

01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:33.167
THEM --

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:36.637
RIGHT AS WELL AS BEING SURE THAT

01:34:36.704 --> 01:34:38.439
CALIFORNIA WOULD.

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:41.042
WHERE OF COURSE IN THAT CASE --

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:43.644
THEY WOULD HAVE TO AGREED.

01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:45.579
TO BE THE SITE FOR THE PLAN OR

01:34:45.646 --> 01:34:48.516

01:34:51.752 --> 01:34:54.255
BY THINGS THAT THE BIGGEST.

01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:55.423

INFORMATION GETS FROM HIS AT THE

01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:59.126

CALIFORNIA'S TRY BETTER IN A

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:08.636

01:44:53.987 --> 01:44:55.489
COMMITTED CONTINUE TO VOMIT

01:44:55.555 --> 01:44:57.190
BLOOD AND EVENTUALLY BEGAN TO

01:44:57.257 --> 01:44:58.592
LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS.

01:44:58.659 --> 01:45:00.360
I WANTED TO CALL 911- BUT EVEN

01:45:00.427 --> 01:45:02.129
AS HE WAS LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS

01:45:02.195 --> 01:45:03.797
MY HUSBAND INSISTED THAT I NOT

01:45:03.864 --> 01:45:05.565
CALL AN AMBULANCE BECAUSE OF OUR

01:45:05.632 --> 01:45:06.933
IMMIGRATION STATUS.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.035
I FELT SO FRUSTRATED IN THAT

01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:11.605
MOMENT IT SO MUCH BECAUSE HE

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:13.340
COULDN'T SEE A DOCTOR TO A POINT

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:14.641
WHERE HE COULD POTENTIALLY DIE

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:15.909
BUT JUST BECAUSE OF HIS STATUS

01:45:15.976 --> 01:45:17.310
HE WAS STILL AFRAID OF ANY

01:45:17.377 --> 01:45:19.413
CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD COME

01:45:19.479 --> 01:45:20.847
WITH SEEKING MEDICAL ATTENTION.

01:45:20.914 --> 01:45:22.215
HOWEVER I CAN ONLY THINK OF

01:45:22.282 --> 01:45:23.550
SAVING MY HUSBAND'STHE DESPITE

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:26.286
HIS PROTESTS I CALL 911-2 HELP

01:45:26.353 --> 01:45:27.187
TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.

01:45:27.254 --> 01:45:28.522
WHEN WE ARRIVED TO THE EMERGENCY

01:45:28.588 --> 01:45:30.090
ROOM THE NURSE SAID HE HAD LOST

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:31.758
SO MUCH BLOOD THAT IF WE ARRIVED

01:45:31.825 --> 01:45:33.427
EVEN JUST MOMENTS LATER HE WOULD

01:45:33.493 --> 01:45:35.128
HAVE DIED?

01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:36.063
WHILE YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH THAT

01:45:36.129 --> 01:45:37.264
AT THE TIME HE WAS OFFERED

01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:39.266
EMERGENCY SERVICES CURRENTLY WE

01:45:39.332 --> 01:45:40.634
ARE BACK AT SQUARE ONE BECAUSE

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:41.935
WE STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

01:45:42.002 --> 01:45:43.637
ACCESS ANY HEALTH CARE SINCE HE

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:44.171
HAD BEEN RELEASED FROM THE

01:45:44.237 --> 01:45:46.106
EMERGENCY ROOM.

01:45:46.173 --> 01:45:47.140
I AM AFRAID EVERYDAY THAT A

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:48.475

BUT BECAUSE OF OUR STATUS WE ARE

01:45:54.514 --> 01:45:56.516
INELIGIBLE FOR PREVENTATIVE CARE

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:58.552
THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED US AVOID

01:45:58.618 --> 01:45:59.519
SITUATIONS LIKE MY HUSBAND.

01:45:59.586 --> 01:46:00.387

PERFORMED AN ANALYSIS OF THE

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:33.139
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXTEND

NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE AND

01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:40.213
WE'VE WE'VE WE FIND THAT THIS

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:41.514
RELIGIOUS PRESENTS LEGISLATURE

01:53:41.581 --> 01:53:41.948
WITH.

01:53:42.015 --> 01:53:43.149
AN OPPORTUNITY CHOOSE AMONG ITS

01:53:43.216 --> 01:53:46.853
PRIORITIES POPULATION TO EXPAND --

01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:48.621
EXPAND COVERAGE TO AND WHERE

01:53:48.688 --> 01:53:51.324
DEVOTE ITS RESOURCES THERE --

01:53:51.391 --> 01:53:52.425
WE DO --

01:53:52.492 --> 01:53:54.394
RAISE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS --

01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:56.162
AND CONCERNS AROUND THE ESTIMATE

01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:58.097
IT THE ESTIMATED COST OF THE

01:53:58.164 --> 01:53:59.299
EXPANSION --

01:53:59.365 --> 01:54:01.401
FIRST WE WOULD NOTE THAT AT

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:03.036
LEAST IN THE FIRST YEAR THE

01:54:03.102 --> 01:54:06.739
COSTS ARE LIKELY OVERSTATED --

01:54:06.806 --> 01:54:08.474
FOR ONE IMPLEMENTATION IS LIKELY

01:54:08.541 --> 01:54:10.910
NOT TO OCCUR ON JULY FIRST BUT

01:54:10.977 --> 01:54:12.712
IS LIKELY TO TAKE SOME TIME TO

01:54:12.779 --> 01:54:15.014
ULTIMATELY IMPLEMENT SO --

01:54:15.081 --> 01:54:16.583
THERE MIGHT BE HALF YOUR COSTS

01:54:16.649 --> 01:54:18.451
ARE THREE FORCE HERE COSTS OR SO

01:54:18.518 --> 01:54:19.719
FORTH IN THE FIRST YEAR.

01:54:19.786 --> 01:54:21.354
SECOND WE FIND THAT THE CASELOAD

01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:22.855
ESTIMATE --

01:54:22.922 --> 01:54:24.657
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:54:24.724 --> 01:54:27.060
LIKELY SOMEWHAT OVERSTATED --

01:54:27.126 --> 01:54:28.861
THE ASSUMPTION THEY THEY SUMA

01:54:28.928 --> 01:54:30.230
RATHER THE ADMINISTRATION

01:54:30.296 --> 01:54:31.564
ASSUMES A RATHER HIGH TAKE UP

01:54:31.631 --> 01:54:33.466
RATE THAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:34.934
PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO OCCUR.

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:37.804
AND SO WE WOULD --

01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:40.974
ADVISE THAT THE LEGISLATURE --

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.075
GIVEN THIS ASSUMPTION BY

01:54:42.141 --> 01:54:43.543
PROBABLY AROUND TWENTY MILLION

01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:45.011
DOLLARS --

01:54:45.078 --> 01:54:46.346
WE ALSO --

01:54:46.412 --> 01:54:48.081
IT BOTH IN OUR ANALYSIS OF THE

01:54:48.147 --> 01:54:49.616
MEDICAL BUDGET AS WELL AS A

01:54:49.682 --> 01:54:51.084
SUBSEQUENT REPORT --

01:54:51.150 --> 01:54:53.987
THAT WE RELEASED TO ANALYZING --

01:54:54.053 --> 01:54:56.489
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED CHANGES

01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:56.956
TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE

01:54:57.023 --> 01:54:57.724
REALIGNMENT --

01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:59.459
WE RAISE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS

01:54:59.525 --> 01:55:01.661
AROUND THE PROPOSED REDIRECTION

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:04.130
OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM

01:55:04.197 --> 01:55:06.099
COUNTY INDIGENT --

01:55:06.165 --> 01:55:08.968
HEALTH FUNDING AND SO.

01:55:09.035 --> 01:55:11.137
AND WE FIND WHILE WE FIND THAT

01:55:11.204 --> 01:55:13.206
SOME REDIRECTION IS LIKELY

01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:15.775
APPROPRIATE GIVEN ONE THERE IS

01:55:15.842 --> 01:55:17.010
GOOD THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE

01:55:17.076 --> 01:55:18.678
SOMEWHAT LOWER COSTS WHILE FOR

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:20.113
INDIGENT CARE FOLLOWING THIS

01:55:20.179 --> 01:55:20.980
PROPOSAL.

01:55:21.047 --> 01:55:23.549
AND TO THAT WE WHEN WE SET THE

01:55:23.616 --> 01:55:25.585
THE RATE AT 60% WE DIDN'T

01:55:25.652 --> 01:55:26.986
NECESSARILY GET THAT RIGHT AS A

01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:27.654
STATE --

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:29.055
THAT WOULD THAT WAS A PROJECTION

01:55:29.122 --> 01:55:31.190
AND SO THE ACA UNDER THE ACA

01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:33.192
TAKE UP FOR MEDI CAL COVERAGE AN

01:55:33.259 --> 01:55:34.994
OLD AND OTHERWISE HAS BEEN QUITE

01:55:35.061 --> 01:55:35.595
HIGH.

01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:38.164
AND SUBSEQUENTLY WE ALSO

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:39.465
EXPANDED COVERAGE TO

01:55:39.532 --> 01:55:42.835
UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN THROUGH SB

01:55:42.902 --> 01:55:45.638
SEVENTY FIVE WE DID NOT --

01:55:45.705 --> 01:55:49.242
TIES THAT EXPANSION FUNDING SO

01:55:49.309 --> 01:55:51.778
WE DO THINK THAT SOME REDUCTION --

01:55:51.844 --> 01:55:54.314
OR SOME REDIRECTION OF FUNDING

01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:55.481
FROM --

01:55:55.548 --> 01:55:58.084
COUNTY HEALTH REALIGNMENT TO THE

01:55:58.151 --> 01:56:00.053
GENERAL FUND TO OFFSET THE COST

01:56:00.119 --> 01:56:01.587
OF THIS THIS AND OTHER

01:56:01.654 --> 01:56:03.122
EXPANSIONS COULD BE APPROPRIATE

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:04.757
BUT WE DO QUESTION THE MAGNITUDE

01:56:04.824 --> 01:56:07.994
AND SCOPE. FOR ONE WE THINK THAT --

01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:09.729
THE THE RE DIRECTION AT THIS

01:56:09.796 --> 01:56:11.264
LEVEL LEASE FOR CERTAIN COUNTIES

01:56:11.331 --> 01:56:12.799
IS LIKELY --

01:56:12.865 --> 01:56:14.300
TO IMPACT EXISTING FUNDING FOR

01:56:14.367 --> 01:56:16.102
PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES AS

01:56:16.169 --> 01:56:17.470
OPPOSED ENGINE CARE HOW HEALTH

01:56:17.537 --> 01:56:19.405
INDIGENT CARE ACTIVITIES AND SO

01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:20.073
THAT -- IS

01:56:20.139 --> 01:56:21.541
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:56:21.607 --> 01:56:22.942
MIGHT CONSIDER --

01:56:23.009 --> 01:56:25.111
IN ADDITION IT RAISES QUESTIONS

01:56:25.178 --> 01:56:27.113
ABOUT THE ONGOING VIABILITY OF

01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:29.982
COUNT OF COUNTY INDIGENT HEALTH

01:56:30.049 --> 01:56:31.084
FOR THOSE COUNTY STATE --

01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:32.218
RUN THROUGH THE COUNTY MEDICAL

01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:34.320
SERVICES PROGRAM AS THIS

02:03:13.986 --> 02:03:15.855
STD CARE.

02:03:15.921 --> 02:03:17.156
RIGHT BECAUSE WE'VE UNDER CUT

RIGHT.

02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:39.645
SO YOU KNOW ALSO I IT IS I THINK

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:41.380

02:03:49.822 --> 02:03:52.057
MENTAL HEALTH PIECE HOUSE THE

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:53.125
THE MAN DIDN'T EACH COUNTY

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:54.193
LIGHTING UP THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

OF MONEY YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH

02:03:59.565 --> 02:04:00.266

MORE I WHO KNOWS.

02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:11.777
MAYBE THERE'S SOME CORRELATION

02:04:11.844 --> 02:04:16.882
WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH DEMAND

02:04:16.949 --> 02:04:19.385
PROBABLY NOT TO THE PROPER.

02:04:19.451 --> 02:04:21.220
AND THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES ARE

02:04:21.287 --> 02:04:23.856
ACTUALLY AVAILABLE --

02:04:23.923 --> 02:04:24.957
FOR MENTAL HEALTH IN EACH OF THE

02:04:25.024 --> 02:04:26.959
COUNTIES BASIN THAT COMPARED TO

02:04:27.026 --> 02:04:28.928
WHAT THE DEMAND IS I KNOW IT'S

02:04:28.994 --> 02:04:30.162
COMPLEX QUESTION THAT THAT'S

02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:31.463
WHAT DIRECTORS AND I AGREE WITH

02:04:31.530 --> 02:04:31.964
HER THERE.

02:04:32.031 --> 02:04:33.566
THAT'S A COMPLEX QUESTION YOU

KNOW WHAT IS THE ACTUAL DEMAND

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:35.935
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE

02:04:36.001 --> 02:04:37.203
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO SO.

02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:38.971
BEFORE WE START TINKERING AROUND

02:04:39.038 --> 02:04:41.473
WITH THIS THING AND AND IT DID

02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:43.676
IT DID IT LIKE THAT THE SIX

02:04:43.742 --> 02:04:44.243
SIXTY THREE MILLION A LOT OF

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:44.476
MONEY.

02:04:44.543 --> 02:04:46.378
IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS WE

02:04:46.445 --> 02:04:47.713
MIGHT THINK THAT IS THAT THE

02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:49.515
RIGHT POT TO GO FOR TO TRY TO

02:04:49.582 --> 02:04:50.649
FIGURE THAT OUT SPECIALLY GIVEN

02:04:50.716 --> 02:04:52.751
ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT

02:04:52.818 --> 02:04:53.552
IMPACTS SO.

02:04:53.619 --> 02:04:55.921
SAYS TO FOR THAT.

02:04:55.988 --> 02:04:58.624
SOME HOPING THAT WE CAN REVISIT

02:04:58.691 --> 02:04:59.792
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE

02:04:59.859 --> 02:05:01.527
I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS HAS AN

02:05:01.594 --> 02:05:02.928

HOPING WE CAN EVEN GO FARTHER.

02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:12.605
I THE CONCERNED AT THE FINANCING

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:14.340
MECHANISM INCLUDES A PIECE THAT

02:05:14.406 --> 02:05:16.876
HAS WIDE RANGING IMPLICATIONS

02:05:16.942 --> 02:05:17.409
ACTUALLY FOR THE VERY SAME

LIKELY WITH THAT'S WHEN THEY

02:05:24.316 --> 02:05:26.151

SOMEONE TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF THE

02:05:45.170 --> 02:05:46.105
SPOT WHICH AT LEAST AT THIS

02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:47.539
POINT IS NOT.

02:05:47.606 --> 02:05:49.108
I'M NOT SURE WHAT I CAN SAY WITH

02:05:49.174 --> 02:05:51.944

THE RIGHT RESOURCES THERE YET.

02:05:54.280 --> 02:06:01.086

THIS PROPOSAL.

02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:25.110
WELL THERE'S NO COMMITMENT TO

02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:26.946
CHANGE OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:06:27.012 --> 02:06:30.015

ENTIRELY BUT I THINK WE NEED TO

02:06:50.235 --> 02:06:52.171
LOOK AT WHERE ARE FUNDING

02:06:52.237 --> 02:06:53.739

AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S GONNA BE

02:07:03.148 --> 02:07:05.117
CLAWED BACK IS MUCH LARGER THAN

02:07:05.184 --> 02:07:06.685

THE TO IMPLEMENT A MEDI CAL

02:39:07.671 --> 02:39:10.207
EXPRESS LANE PATHWAY TO

02:39:10.274 --> 02:39:12.376
ENROLLMENT HROUGH.

02:39:12.442 --> 02:39:13.043
THROUGH THE WICKETS THAT THROUGH

02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:14.378
WORK ON THIS IS ABOUT FIVE

02:39:14.444 --> 02:39:15.946
MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE

02:39:16.013 --> 02:39:17.781
BUDGET YEAR AND AS YOU KNOW

02:39:17.848 --> 02:39:19.917
THERE'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:39:19.983 --> 02:39:20.884
THOUSAND UNINSURED CHILDREN AS

02:39:20.951 --> 02:39:22.019
YOU HEARD --

02:39:22.085 --> 02:39:24.087
HALF OF THEM ARE ELIGIBLE SO

02:39:24.154 --> 02:39:26.690
REALLY OUR WORK IS TO FIND THEM

02:39:26.757 --> 02:39:27.958
AND ENROLL THEM --

02:39:28.025 --> 02:39:29.760
THE SMART STRATEGY WOULD BE TO

02:39:29.826 --> 02:39:31.929
GO TO OTHER STATE PROGRAMS WHERE

02:39:31.995 --> 02:39:34.064
THE SIMILAR ELIGIBILITY RULES

02:39:34.131 --> 02:39:35.198
AND THOSE FAMILIES ARE WERE

02:39:35.265 --> 02:39:36.967
LARGE NUMBER OF FAMILIES ARE.

02:39:37.034 --> 02:39:42.973
AND ENROLL THEM FROM THEIR WHERE

02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:45.742
WHICH IS A NUTRITIONAL PROGRAM

02:39:45.809 --> 02:39:47.077
BUT NOT ROLE TO MEDI CAL AND

02:39:47.144 --> 02:39:48.478
BASED ON ELIGIBILITY THEY ALL

02:39:48.545 --> 02:39:49.913
SHOULD BE ENROLLED.

02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:51.481
AN ELIGIBLE FOR MATT AND MEDI

02:39:51.548 --> 02:39:54.217

02:39:54.284 --> 02:39:55.552
THOUSAND PREGNANT WOMEN AND THIS

02:39:55.619 --> 02:39:57.020
IS A CONCERNING PROBLEM BECAUSE

02:39:57.087 --> 02:39:58.722
WE KNOW THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES

02:39:58.789 --> 02:39:59.890

HELPING THEM AND ROLE.

02:40:02.759 --> 02:40:03.627
SO -- YET

02:40:03.694 --> 02:40:05.095
THERE'S A GOOD STRATEGY HERE

02:40:05.162 --> 02:40:06.229
WHERE THERE'S A FEDERAL --

02:40:06.296 --> 02:40:08.532
FLEXIBILITY THAT ALLOWS US TO

ELIGIBILITY FINDINGS AND SO OUR

02:40:17.074 --> 02:40:19.476
PROPOSAL IS TO DO JUST THAT ON

02:40:19.543 --> 02:40:21.445

SCRUTINIZED BY THE FEDERAL

03:04:45.007 --> 03:04:46.375
GOVERNMENT AND ULTIMATELY WAS

03:04:46.442 --> 03:04:49.311
REVISED DOWNWARD SO THE ROOM IS

03:04:49.378 --> 03:04:51.713
YOU KNOW A SORT OF A REASONABLE

03:04:51.780 --> 03:04:53.282

03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:09.798
THOUGHT SO THAT'S MY

03:05:09.865 --> 03:05:12.734
UNDERSTANDING OF OF AT LEAST.

03:05:12.801 --> 03:05:13.869
WHAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO SOME OF

03:05:13.936 --> 03:05:15.404
THAT REDUCTION.

03:05:15.471 --> 03:05:17.539

YEAR WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT

03:09:13.475 --> 03:09:15.744
FALLS INTO MEDI CAL OUT PROP

03:09:15.811 --> 03:09:16.545
FIFTY FIVE I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU

03:09:16.611 --> 03:09:18.213
CALCULATE THE FORMULA SO I KNOW

03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:19.648
IT'S IN YOUR HANDS FINANCE CAN

03:09:19.715 --> 03:09:20.849
YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHY WE'RE NOT

03:09:20.916 --> 03:09:22.217
SEEING ANY PROP FIFTY FIVE

03:09:22.284 --> 03:09:24.753
REVENUE GOING. TO MEDI CAL AS

03:09:24.820 --> 03:09:26.588
THE VOTERS INTENDED.

03:09:26.655 --> 03:09:27.222
JUGGLING THE PART OF FINANCE YOU

03:09:27.289 --> 03:09:28.290
ARE CORRECT THERE IS NO PROPERTY

03:09:28.356 --> 03:09:29.691
FIVE SPECIFIC REVENUES GOING TO

03:09:29.758 --> 03:09:31.159
THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM.

03:09:31.226 --> 03:09:32.661
I WOULD DEFER TO OUR COLLEAGUES

03:09:32.728 --> 03:09:34.496
IN OUR ARE FORECASTING AND WHO

03:09:34.563 --> 03:09:35.497
COULD PROBABLY BETTER ADDRESS

03:09:35.564 --> 03:09:36.898
THAT QUESTION FOR YOU BUT WE CAN

03:09:36.965 --> 03:09:39.034
WORK TO GET AN ANSWER FOR YOU

03:09:43.505 --> 03:09:45.006
PLEASE.

03:09:45.073 --> 03:09:46.475
AS YOU MENTIONED THE THE FORMULA

03:09:46.541 --> 03:09:47.642
IS IN THE HANDS OF THE

03:09:47.709 --> 03:09:49.144
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT'S IT'S

03:09:49.211 --> 03:09:50.245
SAID THAT CALCULATION IS SOME OF

03:09:50.312 --> 03:09:51.546
THE DISCRETION OF THE DIRECTOR

03:09:51.613 --> 03:09:52.514
OF FINANCE HOWEVER --

03:09:52.581 --> 03:09:54.750
IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

03:09:54.816 --> 03:09:56.118
APPROACH USED IN THIS YEAR'S

03:09:56.184 --> 03:09:57.152
CALCULATION.

03:09:57.219 --> 03:09:59.821
IS VERY SIMILAR IF NOT IDENTICAL

03:09:59.888 --> 03:10:01.957
TO THE APPROACH USE LAST YEAR --

03:10:02.023 --> 03:10:04.593
IN OUR OFFICE DID RELEASE ARE

03:10:04.659 --> 03:10:05.460
WALK THROUGH THA --

03:10:05.527 --> 03:10:07.028
CALCULATION AND OUTLINED MANY

03:10:07.095 --> 03:10:08.997
PLACES WHERE THERE COULD BE

03:10:09.064 --> 03:10:10.699
VARYING INTERPRETATIONS OF HOW.

03:10:10.766 --> 03:10:11.933
THE CALCULATION IS DONE AND ONE

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:13.135
IN PARTIULAR.

03:10:13.201 --> 03:10:15.637
RELATES TO THE WORKLOAD BUDGET

03:10:15.704 --> 03:10:17.305
WHICH WOULD SERVE TO INCREASE OR

03:10:17.372 --> 03:10:18.340
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING

03:10:18.406 --> 03:10:19.875
THAT CALCULATION WOULD HAVE LEFT

03:10:19.941 --> 03:10:21.243
OVER FOR MEDI CAL.

03:10:21.309 --> 03:10:23.812
AND LAST YEAR WE DESCRIBED HOW

03:10:23.879 --> 03:10:26.047
THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH --

03:10:26.114 --> 03:10:28.450
IS FAIRLY BROAD AND CONSIDERS

03:10:28.517 --> 03:10:29.818
MANY SERVICES --

03:10:29.885 --> 03:10:31.219
PART OF THE WORKLOAD BUDGET THAT

03:10:31.286 --> 03:10:33.221
OTHER APPROACHES --

03:10:33.288 --> 03:10:35.123
MIGHT NOT AND SO IT IT APPEARS

03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:36.057
THAT THIS --

03:10:36.124 --> 03:10:37.859
CONTINUATION OF A OF A BROAD

03:10:37.926 --> 03:10:38.727
INTERPRETATION OF THE WORKLOAD

03:10:38.794 --> 03:10:41.730
BUDGET HAS CONTRIBUTED --

03:10:41.797 --> 03:10:43.265
TO AGAIN THIS YEAR --

03:10:43.331 --> 03:10:45.867
THERE NOT BEING ANY FUNDING FOR

03:10:45.934 --> 03:10:46.401
MEDI CAL COMING OUT OF THE

03:10:46.468 --> 03:10:47.803
CALCULATION.

03:10:47.869 --> 03:10:49.404
SO I GET A AC A DISEASE FOLLOW

03:10:49.471 --> 03:10:50.071
UP.

03:10:50.138 --> 03:10:51.773
AND I'M TO RECALL THE THEIR

03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:53.575
DISCUSSIONS LAST YEAR --

03:10:53.642 --> 03:10:55.944
AND IS YOU POINTED OUT THIS VERY

03:10:56.011 --> 03:10:58.713
BROAD --

03:10:58.780 --> 03:11:02.684
FROM DALY IS PERSPECTIVE ASISTIR

03:11:02.751 --> 03:11:02.984
[inaudible]

03:11:03.051 --> 03:11:05.320
I GUESS.

03:11:05.387 --> 03:11:06.988
IT'S THAT THAT IS IN THE HANDS

03:11:07.055 --> 03:11:09.391
OF FINANCE BUT IT ACCORDING TO

03:11:09.457 --> 03:11:11.259
NISHA BUT I MEAN.

03:11:11.326 --> 03:11:12.561
I GUESS THE QUESTION MIGHT BE

03:11:12.627 --> 03:11:13.728
AND YOU CAN TELL ME YOU DON'T IS

03:11:13.795 --> 03:11:15.030
LIKE WELL HOW ABOUT

03:11:15.096 --> 03:11:16.531
APPROXIMATELY HOW MUCH OR WHAT

03:11:16.598 --> 03:11:18.033
SKILL OF MONEY WE SHOULD WE BE

03:11:18.099 --> 03:11:20.202
EXPECTING FROM PROP FIFTY FIVE I

03:11:20.268 --> 03:11:21.636
MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE YOU

03:11:21.703 --> 03:11:22.270
KNOW THE THING IS.

03:11:22.337 --> 03:11:25.407
IS WE'RE NOT A DOWN ECONOMY

03:11:25.473 --> 03:11:27.175
RIGHT NOW WE'RE A REVENUES ARE

03:11:27.242 --> 03:11:28.677
GOOD AND SO FORTH AND JUST

03:11:28.743 --> 03:11:30.512
DECIDED SHE TO ME THAT.

03:11:30.579 --> 03:11:32.247
NOTHING THERE'S THAT THAT'S IT

03:11:32.314 --> 03:11:33.648
THAT EVEN IN A YEAR LIKE THE

03:11:33.715 --> 03:11:35.584
PAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE WE

03:11:35.650 --> 03:11:37.052
HAVE NOTHING THAT SHOWS UP.

03:11:37.118 --> 03:11:38.520
AND AND AND JUST CONCERNED THAT

03:11:38.587 --> 03:11:39.654
THE VOTERS.

03:11:39.721 --> 03:11:41.456
LOOK AT THIS AND THEY GO WELL WE

03:11:41.523 --> 03:11:43.892
VOTED FOR THIS.

03:11:43.959 --> 03:11:46.695
AND Và PLAYING GAMES.

03:11:46.761 --> 03:11:48.396
PLAYING GAMES TO BE SURE THAT

03:11:48.463 --> 03:11:48.997
MONEY ISN'T GOING TO WHERE WE

03:11:49.064 --> 03:11:50.565
INTENDED.

03:11:50.632 --> 03:11:51.199
NOW.

03:11:51.266 --> 03:11:53.602
ANY IN ANY ANY COMMENTS ABOUT

03:11:53.668 --> 03:11:55.470
THE TERMS OF WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE

03:11:55.537 --> 03:11:57.572
SHOULD THAT SHOULD BE EXPECTING

03:11:57.639 --> 03:11:59.474
IN FIFTY FIVE I REALIZED THERE'S

03:11:59.541 --> 03:12:01.109
DIFFERENT WAYS A CALCULATED BUT

03:12:01.176 --> 03:12:03.478
YEAH EXCTLY THE WAY I DON'T

03:12:03.545 --> 03:12:06.414
HAVE A HE LIKE ALTERNATE.

03:12:06.481 --> 03:12:07.582
COMPLEXITY IS TO THE CALCULATION

03:12:07.649 --> 03:12:08.650
AND I THINK IN A REPORT LAST

03:12:08.717 --> 03:12:09.684
YEAR WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE

03:12:09.751 --> 03:12:10.819
ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT IT'S

03:12:10.886 --> 03:12:12.153
UNCERTAIN HOW EXACTLY IT SHOULD

03:12:12.220 --> 03:12:13.521
BE INTERPRETED --

03:12:13.588 --> 03:12:15.790
BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT WITH THE

03:12:15.857 --> 03:12:17.259
THE CURRENT --

03:12:17.325 --> 03:12:18.560
INTERPRETATION OF THE WORKLOAD

03:12:18.627 --> 03:12:20.128
BUDGET AND THE SAME

03:12:20.195 --> 03:12:21.429
INTERPRETATION INTERPRETATION

03:12:21.496 --> 03:12:22.731
THAT WAS USED IN THE ENACTED

03:12:22.797 --> 03:12:24.065
BUDGET LAST YEAR --

03:12:24.132 --> 03:12:25.867
IT'S IT'S RELATIVELY UNLIKELY

03:12:25.934 --> 03:12:27.235
THAT THAT THERE WOULD BE FUNDS

03:12:27.302 --> 03:12:28.770
APPROPRIATED IN THE FUTURE.

03:12:28.837 --> 03:12:30.739
AS THE NEW PROPOSALS THAT ARE

03:12:30.805 --> 03:12:31.506
PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S

03:12:31.573 --> 03:12:33.141
BUDGET SO SORT OF EAT INTO THE

03:12:33.208 --> 03:12:33.942
REVENUES.

03:12:34.009 --> 03:12:35.110
AND ACTUALLY AND I KNOW IF MODEL

03:12:35.176 --> 03:12:36.344
THE SO HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD WE

03:12:36.411 --> 03:12:37.312
HAVE TO BRING IN AN ORDER FOR

03:12:37.379 --> 03:12:40.015
SAID ANYTHING THE FALLEN FIFTY

03:12:40.081 --> 03:12:40.615
FIVE WOULD BE THE THRESHOLD.

03:12:40.682 --> 03:12:41.016
GIVEN THIS KIND OF

03:12:41.082 --> 03:12:43.551
INTERPRETATION.

03:12:43.618 --> 03:12:44.920
I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER WITH ME

03:12:44.986 --> 03:12:45.887
TODAY BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE

03:12:45.954 --> 03:12:46.488
CAN LOOK AT AND RIGHT BACK TO

03:12:46.554 --> 03:12:50.058
YOU.

03:12:50.125 --> 03:12:51.626
SO OKAY WELL I EIGHT YOU KNOW MY

03:12:51.693 --> 03:12:53.795
MY CONCERN IS IS THAT EVERY TIME

03:12:53.862 --> 03:12:56.665
WE GO TO THE VOTERS AND WE ASK.

03:12:56.731 --> 03:12:57.832
VOTERS.

03:12:57.899 --> 03:13:00.335
TO PONY UP SOME MORE MONEY.

03:13:00.402 --> 03:13:01.836
RIGHT AND WE TOLD THE VOTERS

03:13:01.903 --> 03:13:03.238
THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO GO FOR

03:13:03.305 --> 03:13:05.840
AND IT DOESN'T GO THERE.

03:13:05.907 --> 03:13:07.709
OTHER THAN THAT THAT UNDERMINES

03:13:07.776 --> 03:13:10.011
CONFIDENCE IN --

03:13:10.078 --> 03:13:12.113
IF YOU AS A IN IN CONFIDENCE IN

03:13:12.180 --> 03:13:13.548
ALL OF US HERE.

03:13:13.615 --> 03:13:15.483
AND SO --

03:13:15.550 --> 03:13:17.152
AND AS A THINK.

03:13:17.218 --> 03:13:18.753
I THINK MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE

03:13:18.820 --> 03:13:20.822
KIND OF INCREDULOUS TO THINK

03:13:20.889 --> 03:13:22.424
THAT IN THIS ECONOMY.

03:13:22.490 --> 03:13:24.025
THAT NONE OF IT ACTUALLY MAKES

03:13:24.092 --> 03:13:26.628
ITS WAY.

03:13:26.695 --> 03:13:27.696
TO BACK I MEAN IT'S ONE THING TO

03:13:27.762 --> 03:13:30.432
HAVE A DOWN YEAR AND ARE THERE

03:13:30.498 --> 03:13:31.967
IT'S NOT SO GOOD NO I'M

03:13:32.033 --> 03:13:33.401
RECESSION OR OR THAT BRINK OF

03:13:33.468 --> 03:13:35.937
RECESSION WHATEVER NOW IN TERMS

03:13:36.004 --> 03:13:40.041
OF BUT THAT THAT'S THAT'S

03:13:40.108 --> 03:13:41.609
CONCERNING HIS EYES THAT THEY

03:13:41.676 --> 03:13:43.311
THINK THAT --

03:13:43.378 --> 03:13:44.446
YEAH I MEAN WE PUT IN THE HANDS

03:13:44.512 --> 03:13:46.815
OF FINANCE BECAUSE WE HOPE THAT

03:13:46.881 --> 03:13:48.850
YOU KNOW EXPECT THAT THAT THAT'S

03:13:48.917 --> 03:13:50.552
THAT THREE THINGS GOING TO BE

03:13:50.618 --> 03:13:51.252
DONE I MEAN THAT'S WHAT THE

03:13:51.319 --> 03:13:52.454
VOTERS THAT I MEAN IT'S MOTORS

03:13:52.520 --> 03:13:55.123
VOTED FOR IT AT NIGHT IT'S THAT

03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:55.957
THAT WAS DRAFTED.

03:13:56.024 --> 03:13:57.692
BUT WHEN NOTHING SHOWS UP I MEAN

03:13:57.759 --> 03:13:58.026
IT.

03:13:58.093 --> 03:14:00.295
CALLING WELL WHAT'S GOING WHAT'S

03:14:00.362 --> 03:14:02.230
REALLY GOING ON THERE.

03:14:02.297 --> 03:14:04.599
EIGHT AND EIGHT AND JUST THE

03:14:04.666 --> 03:14:06.034
I'VE WILL MY CONTINUE EXPRESSED

03:14:06.101 --> 03:14:08.436
MY CONCERN THAT --

03:14:08.503 --> 03:14:10.538
OTHER MANY PRIORITIES THAT WE

03:14:10.605 --> 03:14:13.875
HAVE AND AND YEAH I THINK THE

03:14:13.942 --> 03:14:14.976
VOTERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE IT

03:14:15.043 --> 03:14:16.444
OUT TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY AGREE

03:14:16.511 --> 03:14:17.479
WITH THE PRIORITY IN OUT AND

03:14:17.545 --> 03:14:19.614
OFTEN TIMES THEY DO YOU KNOW THE

03:14:19.681 --> 03:14:20.181
WEEK DAYS --

03:14:20.248 --> 03:14:23.051
SUPPORTED A SORT OF RIGHT EVEN

03:14:23.118 --> 03:14:25.086
BUT IF.

03:14:25.153 --> 03:14:26.388
BUT NOW WE HEARD THIS WITH

03:14:26.454 --> 03:14:27.122
OTHERS SB ONE AND HER.

03:14:27.188 --> 03:14:28.056
OTHER PRIOR ONES THAT IF THEY

03:14:28.123 --> 03:14:31.126
FEEL LIKE THE MY SIX THIRTY FEEL

03:14:31.192 --> 03:14:32.260
LIKE THE MONEY DOESN'T GO TO

03:14:32.327 --> 03:14:33.528
WHERE THEY WANTED TO THAT WE'RE

03:14:33.595 --> 03:14:34.729
GONNA FIND A WAY TO SCARF THAT

03:14:34.796 --> 03:14:36.231
MONEY MOVE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

03:14:36.297 --> 03:14:37.532
YOU KNOW PLAY SOME DO SOME

03:14:37.599 --> 03:14:39.167
TECHNICAL LEGAL THING SO I MEAN

03:14:39.234 --> 03:14:40.435
THERE'S THE LEGAL PART.

03:14:40.502 --> 03:14:42.103
RIGHT AND I THINK WE TALKED AS

03:14:42.170 --> 03:14:43.471
LAST TIME AND WE CAN.

03:14:43.538 --> 03:14:44.906
WE GO TO COURT YOU WIN BECAUSE

03:14:44.973 --> 03:14:46.908
NOW WE SHOULD FINANCE BUT AT THE

03:14:46.975 --> 03:14:48.043
TIME OF THE MURDERS QUE CONCERNS

03:14:48.109 --> 03:14:50.078
ARE TRUST IN THE LEADERSHIP AND

03:14:50.145 --> 03:14:50.812
INTENT.

03:14:50.879 --> 03:14:51.980
AND THAT'S WHY I'M CONCERNED IS

03:14:52.047 --> 03:14:53.314
BEING A ROAD AND THAT ALSO MEANS

03:14:53.381 --> 03:14:55.316
ARE LESS LIKELY TO FEEL THAT THE

03:14:55.383 --> 03:14:57.252
THE WANT TO SUPPORT --

03:14:57.318 --> 03:14:58.520
OTHER THINGS AS WELL IT'S NOT

03:14:58.586 --> 03:14:59.988
THAT THEY'LL SUPPORT FIND FUNNY

03:15:00.055 --> 03:15:01.823
THOSE THINGS IS THAT THAT

03:15:01.890 --> 03:15:02.424
THEY'RE NOT SURE YOU CAN TRUST

03:15:02.490 --> 03:15:03.491
US.

03:15:03.558 --> 03:15:06.261
AND THAT'S THAT'S MY BIG CONCERN.

03:15:06.327 --> 03:15:08.496
SO I I I I REALLY I REALLY HOPE

SO THE REASON I ASKED THAT

03:38:07.507 --> 03:38:08.708
QUESTION THEN OF RAISED IT MANY

03:38:08.775 --> 03:38:10.744
TIMES OF FORWARD HERE AND SOLEMN

03:38:10.811 --> 03:38:12.245
LOOKING ELIO BUT I ALSO WE CAN

03:38:12.312 --> 03:38:13.146
pFINANCE.

YOU WORK FOR US AS WE LOOK AT

03:38:14.881 --> 03:38:16.817
YOU FIRST --

03:38:16.883 --> 03:38:18.452
BECAUSE I THINK IN WE SCORE

03:38:18.518 --> 03:38:20.120
PROPOSALS LIKE THIS ALL RIGHT

03:38:20.187 --> 03:38:21.755
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY

03:38:21.822 --> 03:38:23.590
OKAY WELL WE YOU KNOW WE GET THE

03:38:23.657 --> 03:38:27.594
TAKE SOME MONEY BECAUSE WE GOT A

WORKERS AND SO FORTH --

03:38:30.897 --> 03:38:32.098
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA REDUCE

03:38:32.165 --> 03:38:33.934
UTILIZATION I REALIZE WE DO LIKE

03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:35.402
CAPITATION THEN WELL IT'S ALL

03:38:35.469 --> 03:38:36.770
VERY IN CAPITATION BUT I MEAN

03:38:36.837 --> 03:38:38.338
REALLY I MEAN THAT THE COMES

03:38:38.405 --> 03:38:39.773

TO YOU KNOW EVEN JUST

03:38:40.474 --> 03:38:42.008
FINANCIALLY SO I THINK OBVIOUSLY

03:38:42.075 --> 03:38:43.477
ONE THE MOTIVATIONS ALWAYS A IS

03:38:43.543 --> 03:38:44.611
OF COURSE WHICH I RDUCE HUMAN

03:38:44.678 --> 03:38:46.913
SUFFERING RIGHT CELL AND GOING

03:38:46.980 --> 03:38:48.048
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR THAT

03:38:48.114 --> 03:38:49.616
HOW MUCH YOU PAY FOR IS BAD

03:38:49.683 --> 03:38:52.052
ENOUGH WITHOUT.

03:38:52.118 --> 03:38:53.520
THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE BILL --

03:38:53.587 --> 03:38:56.623
BUT OR HOW MUCH WHO PAYS THE

03:38:56.690 --> 03:38:57.991
FIELDS TEACHERS WHO GETS ADORNS

03:38:58.058 --> 03:38:59.292
MEDI CAL --

03:38:59.359 --> 03:39:01.862

TO A PRETTY HIGH STANDARD OF

03:39:07.667 --> 03:39:09.469
WEEKENDS I MEAN THE REAL

03:39:09.536 --> 03:39:11.004
QUESTION IS IS THIS WELL THIS

03:39:11.071 --> 03:39:11.271
ACTUALLY.

03:39:11.338 --> 03:39:12.072
I MEAN.

03:39:12.138 --> 03:39:12.839
SHOULD THIS BE EVEN SCORES

03:39:12.906 --> 03:39:16.109
ACOSTA BEYOND THE IMPLEMENTATION.

03:39:16.176 --> 03:39:18.144
AND AND AND AND DIED BUT I WILL

03:39:18.211 --> 03:39:19.546

03:39:21.848 --> 03:39:23.116
RIGHT BUT I MEAN THIS IS ONE OF

03:39:23.183 --> 03:39:24.417
THE PROPOSALS I THINK WE REALLY

03:39:24.484 --> 03:39:26.319
OUGHT TO LOOK AT AND SO I'M

03:39:26.386 --> 03:39:26.853

BECAUSE UNLIKE EXPECT AND DO ALL

03:39:29.089 --> 03:39:31.191
THE RESEARCH THEMSELVES AND I

03:39:31.258 --> 03:39:32.993
HOPE WE CAN LOOK AT THAT AND SAY

03:39:33.059 --> 03:39:34.661
WELL WHAT DO WE THINK GAIL THIS

03:39:34.728 --> 03:39:36.463
WILL WHAT WILL HAPPEN SO I MEAN

03:39:36.530 --> 03:39:37.364
SOME OF THAT'S GONNA REALIZE

03:39:37.430 --> 03:39:39.399
THERE'S SOME CALCULATION RIGHT

03:39:39.466 --> 03:39:40.467
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE

WHICH CALIFORNIA HAS SOUGHT.

03:53:39.905 --> 03:53:44.744
TO PUT A TAX ON MANAGED CARE A

03:53:44.810 --> 03:53:46.412
DECADE -- WE

03:53:46.479 --> 03:53:48.447
NOTE THAT THE STATE IS CURRENTLY

03:53:48.514 --> 03:53:49.315
RECEIVING --

03:53:49.382 --> 03:53:51.217
APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT THREE

BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND --

03:53:54.019 --> 03:53:55.688
OFFSETS AS A RESULT OF THE TAX

03:53:55.755 --> 03:53:59.425
THAT WAS STRUCTURED BACK IN --

03:53:59.492 --> 03:54:01.160
TWENTY SIXTEEN I THINK YOU KNOW

03:54:01.227 --> 03:54:02.962
TO THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA

03:54:03.028 --> 03:54:04.797
AROUND WHY IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN

03:54:04.864 --> 03:54:06.532
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET --

03:54:06.599 --> 03:54:08.100
AND POTENTIAL BARRIERS FOR

03:54:08.167 --> 03:54:09.301
FEDERAL --

03:54:09.368 --> 03:54:11.303
EITHER APPROVAL OR NOT --

03:54:11.370 --> 03:54:12.705
TO THE SUBSEQUENT STATES AFTER

03:54:12.772 --> 03:54:14.273
CALIFORNIA RECEIVED APPROVAL FOR

03:54:14.340 --> 03:54:15.908
THEIR TAX IN TWENTY SIXTEEN HAVE

03:54:15.975 --> 03:54:17.476
BEEN.

03:54:17.543 --> 03:54:19.478
MADE SO I WOULD SAY THAT WELL WE

03:54:19.545 --> 03:54:20.379
CERTAINLY --

03:54:20.446 --> 03:54:22.548
ARE OPEN TO DISCUSSION AROUND

03:54:22.615 --> 03:54:25.351
POTENTIAL MCO TAX EXTENSION I

03:54:25.418 --> 03:54:25.584
THINK --

03:54:25.651 --> 03:54:27.987
SOME OF THE CALCULATION --

03:54:28.053 --> 03:54:29.555
IN THE BUDGET DEVELOPMENT WAS

03:54:29.622 --> 03:54:33.359
AROUND HAS FEDERAL

03:54:33.426 --> 03:54:34.560
ADMINISTRATION --

03:54:34.627 --> 03:54:35.995
THAN THE ONE THAT PREVIOUSLY

03:54:36.061 --> 03:54:38.531
APPROVED THE LAST MCO TAX AND

03:54:38.597 --> 03:54:41.500
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE OTHER --

03:54:41.567 --> 03:54:43.035
TO TALLY OF THE REQUEST THAT WE

03:54:43.102 --> 03:54:44.437
WILL BE SEEKING FROM CMS OR

03:54:44.503 --> 03:54:46.605
OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HAVE --

03:54:46.672 --> 03:54:48.340
THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A CERTAIN --

03:54:48.407 --> 03:54:50.676
CONCERN THAT OTHER THINGS THAT

03:54:50.743 --> 03:54:53.012
CALIFORNIA IS SEEKING --

03:54:53.078 --> 03:54:54.346
MAY OR MAY NOT BE.

03:54:54.413 --> 03:54:56.015
VIEWED IN A FAVORABLE WAY FROM A

03:54:56.081 --> 03:54:57.149
FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE AND SO I

03:54:57.216 --> 03:54:58.317
THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

03:54:58.384 --> 03:55:00.085
REASONS WHY AT THIS POINT THE

03:55:00.152 --> 03:55:00.753
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT

03:55:00.820 --> 03:55:03.155
CONTAIN A MCO TALKS PROPOSAL BUT

03:55:03.222 --> 03:55:03.756
AGAIN.

03:55:03.823 --> 03:55:05.124
HAPPY TO TALK WITH THE

03:55:05.191 --> 03:55:07.460
LEGISLATURE ON AN ONGOING BASIS

03:55:07.526 --> 03:55:08.694
ANA.

03:55:08.761 --> 03:55:08.928
OKAY --

03:55:08.994 --> 03:55:12.531
ALEJO -- WE

03:55:12.598 --> 03:55:15.801
WE RELEASE ANALYSIS OF THE NON

03:55:15.868 --> 03:55:17.303
PROPOSAL OF THE AN EXTENSION OF

03:55:17.369 --> 03:55:18.471
THE MC ATTACKS.

03:55:18.537 --> 03:55:22.174
LAST MONTH AND WE WE DO THINK

03:55:22.241 --> 03:55:23.509
THAT THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY

03:55:23.576 --> 03:55:24.610
AROUND WHETHER OR NOT THE

03:55:24.677 --> 03:55:25.811
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD WOULD

03:55:25.878 --> 03:55:27.680
APPROVE ANY TAX BUT THE NEW --

03:55:27.746 --> 03:55:32.451
BUT THE MOST RECENT TAX IN

03:55:32.518 --> 03:55:33.919
MICHIGAN WAS APPROVED BY THE

03:55:33.986 --> 03:55:35.921
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IT'S VERY

03:55:35.988 --> 03:55:37.456
WAS VERY SIMILARLY STRUCTURED TO

03:55:37.523 --> 03:55:40.593
HOW CALIFORNIA'S IS AND SO WE

03:55:40.659 --> 03:55:42.495
ARE NOT SURE OF WHAT RATIONALE

03:55:42.561 --> 03:55:43.863
NECESSARILY THE FEDERAL

03:55:43.929 --> 03:55:45.731
GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE. FOR

03:55:45.798 --> 03:55:47.566
APPROVING MICHIGAN'S TAX WHILE

03:55:47.633 --> 03:55:49.935
REJECTING AND AN EXTENSION OF

03:55:50.002 --> 03:55:51.770
CALIFORNIA'S.

03:55:51.837 --> 03:55:53.239
MCO TAX.

03:55:53.305 --> 03:55:54.940
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S THERE

03:55:55.007 --> 03:55:56.775
ARE ALWAYS ISSUES THAT THE STATE

03:55:56.842 --> 03:55:58.911
IS WORKING WITH THE FEDS ON WITH

03:55:58.978 --> 03:56:01.213
MEDI CAL AND ANOTHER PROGRAMS --

03:56:01.280 --> 03:56:03.182
MADE AS A SIGNIFICANT EXAMPLE IS

03:56:03.249 --> 03:56:06.118
THE THE END OF THE THIS

03:56:06.185 --> 03:56:07.453
ITERATION OF THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN

03:56:07.520 --> 03:56:08.454
WAIVER --

03:56:08.521 --> 03:56:10.256
THAT BRINGS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

03:56:10.322 --> 03:56:11.490
AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

03:56:11.557 --> 03:56:13.125
ANNUALLY INTO THE STATE.

03:56:13.192 --> 03:56:14.727
OUR UNDERSTANDING HOWEVER IS

03:56:14.793 --> 03:56:16.195
THAT -- THE

03:56:16.262 --> 03:56:18.030
OUR PROSPECTS FOR RECEIVING A

03:56:18.097 --> 03:56:19.498
SIGNIFICANT --

03:56:19.565 --> 03:56:21.133
AND SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNDING

03:56:21.200 --> 03:56:22.768
UNDER THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER

03:56:22.835 --> 03:56:25.070
ARE SOMEWHAT CURTAILED AND IN

03:56:25.137 --> 03:56:27.072
ADDITION THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN FEET

03:56:27.139 --> 03:56:28.474
WAIVER FUNDING THAT WE DO GET IS

03:56:28.541 --> 03:56:30.242
AT IS ACTUALLY NOT AS GREAT AS

03:56:30.309 --> 03:56:32.311
WE AS THE FUNDING THAT WE GET

03:56:32.378 --> 03:56:34.947
UNDER THE MCO TAX SO. FOR THESE

03:56:35.014 --> 03:56:36.248
FOR THESE CONSIDERATIONS WE DO

03:56:36.315 --> 03:56:38.350
THINK AT IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH

03:56:38.417 --> 03:56:40.119
CONSIDERING --

03:56:40.185 --> 03:56:42.521
PURSUING AN EXTENSION OF THE M.

03:56:42.588 --> 03:56:44.156
AND JUST RECOMMENDS THAT SHOULD

03:56:44.223 --> 03:56:46.425
THE LEGISLATURE WHICH TO WISH TO

03:56:46.492 --> 03:56:47.560
RENEW THAT IT DO SO IN

03:56:47.626 --> 03:56:49.528
CONJUNCTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF

03:56:49.595 --> 03:56:49.929
THE BUDGET.

03:56:49.995 --> 03:56:52.264
AS A SOLE GIVE TIME FOR BOTH THE

03:56:52.331 --> 03:56:54.667
STATE TO SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR

03:56:54.733 --> 03:56:56.068

03:57:04.276 --> 03:57:05.077
JUST BECAUSE I GUESS DEPARTMENT

FINANCE IT WOULD ECHO THE

03:57:06.545 --> 03:57:07.980
COMMENTS THAT ADD DIRECTOR KENT

03:57:08.047 --> 03:57:09.915
MADE AT THIS TIME WE WOULD NOTE

03:57:09.982 --> 03:57:12.184
THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PRESENTED

A BALANCED BUDGET.

03:57:13.652 --> 03:57:15.888
AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

03:57:15.955 --> 03:57:17.523
FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS TIME BUT

03:57:17.590 --> 03:57:18.891
WE OF COURSE HAVE NOTED THAT OF

03:57:18.958 --> 03:57:20.726
CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM

IT'S GROWN IN BOTH SIZE AND

04:10:46.464 --> 04:10:47.832
COMPLEXITY OVER THE YEARS

04:10:47.899 --> 04:10:49.367
WITHOUT THE COMMENSURATE

04:10:49.434 --> 04:10:50.969
ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES TO KEEP

04:10:51.035 --> 04:10:51.870

REPORTING ON THOSE THINGS

04:11:00.044 --> 04:11:01.846
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AT TIMES AND

04:11:01.913 --> 04:11:03.281
JUST FOR CONTEXT.

04:11:03.348 --> 04:11:06.651
A 1% FLUCTUATION IN OUR BUDGET

04:11:06.718 --> 04:11:08.420

PAYMENTS INTO RELATIVELY FEW --

04:11:27.305 --> 04:11:28.273
AND THE SOME OF THE THINGS

04:11:28.339 --> 04:11:29.774
RELATED TO THOSE ARE OUTSIDE OF

04:11:29.841 --> 04:11:31.709
OUR CONTROL IN TERMS OF RATES

04:11:31.776 --> 04:11:32.744

VARIOUS COSTS --

04:11:47.792 --> 04:11:49.260
THEIR LARGE SUMS OF MONEY AND

04:11:49.327 --> 04:11:52.397
THEY CREATE COMPLEXITIES IN --

04:11:52.464 --> 04:11:55.600
ADMINISTERING THOSE PROGRAMS --

04:11:55.667 --> 04:11:58.036
ALSO WOULD HIGHLIGHT DRUG REBATE

04:11:58.102 --> 04:11:59.938

INCREASING THAT.

04:12:51.289 --> 04:12:52.757
THAT THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN

04:12:52.824 --> 04:12:54.692

TO TO IMPROVE.

04:13:05.336 --> 04:13:07.639
OUR FISCAL INTEGRITY WERE ALSO

04:13:07.705 --> 04:13:10.108
LOOKING AT LONG TERM SOLUTIONS

04:13:10.174 --> 04:13:12.110
THE SYSTEMS THAT WE USE TO

04:13:12.176 --> 04:13:13.711
ACCOUNT FOR THE HUNDRED BILLION

04:13:13.778 --> 04:13:16.314
DOLLARS OUR OLD IN AN ADEQUATE

04:13:16.381 --> 04:13:19.551
IN IN MANY CASES --

04:13:19.617 --> 04:13:22.186
SO IT ADDITIONALLY REQUEST TO

04:13:22.253 --> 04:13:23.655
ESTABLISH THE MEDI CAL DRUG

04:13:23.721 --> 04:13:25.323
REBATE FUND --

04:13:25.390 --> 04:13:26.858
I TOUCHED ON THE DRUG REBATES

04:13:26.925 --> 04:13:28.860
WHAT WE'RE SIMPLY PROPOSING IS

04:13:28.927 --> 04:13:30.895
TO ESTABLISH A FUND TO ISOLATE

04:13:30.962 --> 04:13:32.463
THE RECEIPT OF THOSE FUNDS SO

04:13:32.530 --> 04:13:34.232
THAT WE CAN BETTER MANAGE THE

04:13:34.299 --> 04:13:35.667
TIMING OF OFFSETTING.

04:13:35.733 --> 04:13:38.436
PAYMENTS IN THE PROGRAM.

04:13:38.503 --> 04:13:40.038
OKAY THANK YOU ALEJO TREATMENTS

04:13:40.104 --> 04:13:41.506
HAVE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THIS WE

04:13:41.573 --> 04:13:43.908
DO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR --

04:13:43.975 --> 04:13:45.910
WE WOULD JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE --

04:13:45.977 --> 04:13:48.479
HOW SERIOUS THIS ISSUE IS --

04:13:48.546 --> 04:13:49.847
THE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

04:13:49.914 --> 04:13:51.349
FLUCTUATIONS.

04:13:51.416 --> 04:13:53.351
WHILE THEY MAY BE SMALL IN SOME

04:13:53.418 --> 04:13:54.185
CASES IN TERMS OF MEDI CAL

04:13:54.252 --> 04:13:55.019
BUDGET THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY

04:13:55.086 --> 04:13:56.487
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE

04:13:56.554 --> 04:13:57.989
OVERALL GENERAL FUND BUDGET.

04:13:58.056 --> 04:13:59.490
AND BAM IN OUR VIEW THEY MAKE IT

04:13:59.557 --> 04:14:00.892
DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

04:14:00.959 --> 04:14:03.494
ESTABLISH LONGER TERM PRIORITIES --

04:14:03.561 --> 04:14:04.896
FOR ALLOCATING RESOURCES BECAUSE

04:14:04.963 --> 04:14:06.798
THOSE PRIORITIES CAN BE UPSET

04:14:06.864 --> 04:14:08.600
AND DISPLACED BY BY CHANGES

04:14:08.666 --> 04:14:11.302
UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN MEDICAL

04:14:11.369 --> 04:14:12.737
COSTS --

04:14:12.804 --> 04:14:13.371
SECOND THING ONE UNDERSCORE IS

04:14:13.438 --> 04:14:14.472
THAT -- IN A

04:14:14.539 --> 04:14:16.674
LOT OF WAYS THE THE SWINGS ARE A

04:14:16.741 --> 04:14:17.542
SYMPTOM OF THE GROWING

04:14:17.609 --> 04:14:18.743
COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAM AS WAS

04:14:18.810 --> 04:14:20.178
MENTIONED.

04:14:20.244 --> 04:14:22.046
AND THIS COMPLEXITY --

04:14:22.113 --> 04:14:23.915
HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT --

04:14:23.982 --> 04:14:24.816
FOR OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS

04:14:24.882 --> 04:14:25.984
INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE TO

04:14:26.050 --> 04:14:27.685
OVERSEE THIS PROGRAM AND REALLY

04:14:27.752 --> 04:14:28.586
UNDERSTAND CLEARLY.

04:14:28.653 --> 04:14:30.822
OUT WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON OFTEN

04:14:30.888 --> 04:14:32.156
THE INFORMATION THAT --

04:14:32.223 --> 04:14:33.424
OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS --

04:14:33.491 --> 04:14:34.158
WOULD NEED IS NOT PUBLICLY

04:14:34.225 --> 04:14:37.261
AVAILABLE EVEN BE DIFFICULT FOR

04:14:37.328 --> 04:14:39.197
THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE.

04:14:39.263 --> 04:14:41.699
AND WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S.

04:14:41.766 --> 04:14:43.101
EXCUSE ME STAFF IMPERFECT

04:14:43.167 --> 04:14:45.136
STAFFING PROPOSAL.

04:14:45.203 --> 04:14:46.204
HAS MERION WE RECOMMEND THAT IT

04:14:46.270 --> 04:14:47.972
BE APPROVED --

04:14:48.039 --> 04:14:49.507
HOWEVER WE THINK IT'S ALSO

04:14:49.574 --> 04:14:51.142
IMPORTANT TO TAKE ACTION TO

04:14:51.209 --> 04:14:52.910
IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE

04:14:52.977 --> 04:14:54.846
MEDI CAL BUDGET FOR OUTSIDE

04:14:54.912 --> 04:14:56.781
STAKEHOLDERS.

04:14:56.848 --> 04:14:58.449
THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG TERM

04:14:58.516 --> 04:14:59.884
PROCESS --

04:14:59.951 --> 04:15:01.653
AND WE AGREE WITH THEM THE

04:15:01.719 --> 04:15:02.887
DEPARTMENT'S APPROACH IF YOU

04:15:02.954 --> 04:15:04.322
KNOW CONTINUING TO LOOK AT THIS

04:15:04.389 --> 04:15:05.790
IN THE SHORT TERM --

04:15:05.857 --> 04:15:06.958
WE THINK IT WOULD.

04:15:07.025 --> 04:15:09.360
MAKE SENSE FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO

04:15:09.427 --> 04:15:09.961
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

04:15:10.028 --> 04:15:10.928
THAT --

04:15:10.995 --> 04:15:12.163
COULD BE GAINED FROM THE

04:15:12.230 --> 04:15:13.798
APPROVAL OF THESE POSITIONS ONE

04:15:13.865 --> 04:15:15.533
EXAMPLE COULD BE --

04:15:15.600 --> 04:15:17.168
ADDITIONAL INTERIM INFORMATION

04:15:17.235 --> 04:15:19.037
ON CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS --

04:15:19.103 --> 04:15:20.371
SINCE THIS IS THE FOCUS OF WHAT

04:15:20.438 --> 04:15:22.073
THESE POSITIONS WOULD BE WORKING

04:15:22.140 --> 04:15:25.677
ON IN THE LONGER TERM --

04:15:25.743 --> 04:15:27.045
TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

04:15:27.111 --> 04:15:28.813
IS A PURPLE INVOLVED AND WE

04:15:28.880 --> 04:15:29.580
WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE

04:15:29.647 --> 04:15:30.548
LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE

04:15:30.615 --> 04:15:31.983
DEPARTMENT TO COME FORWARD WITH

04:15:32.050 --> 04:15:33.551
A PLAN THAT WOULD HAVE SPECIFIC

04:15:33.618 --> 04:15:35.186
STEPS --

04:15:35.253 --> 04:15:38.389
WATER TERM MORE STRUCTURAL --

04:15:38.456 --> 04:15:39.457
ANOTHER THING THAT COULD BE DONE

04:15:39.524 --> 04:15:41.225
IS IS PERHAPS THE ESTABLISHMENT

04:15:41.292 --> 04:15:42.193
OF A WORKING GROUP THAT WOULD

04:15:42.260 --> 04:15:43.194
INCLUDE THE DEPARTMENT

04:15:43.261 --> 04:15:44.295
LEGISLATIVE STAFF OTHER

04:15:44.362 --> 04:15:46.531
STAKEHOLDERS. TO GENERATE IDEAS

04:15:46.597 --> 04:15:48.700
AND PRIORITIZE ONE OF THE WAYS

04:15:48.766 --> 04:15:50.301
TO TO BEST GO ABOUT IMPROVING

04:15:50.368 --> 04:15:52.136
THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE BUDGET

04:15:52.203 --> 04:15:54.639
IMPROVING FISCAL MANAGEMENT --

04:15:54.706 --> 04:15:58.009
ON THE ISSUE OF THE SPECIAL FUND

04:15:58.076 --> 04:15:59.444
FOR DRUG REBATES WE THINK THAT'S

04:15:59.510 --> 04:16:00.611
A PROMISING CONCEPT THEM

04:16:00.678 --> 04:16:02.146
RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE

04:16:02.213 --> 04:16:03.981
PROVE THAT AND AND DEPENDING ON

04:16:04.048 --> 04:16:04.782
HOW THAT.

04:16:04.849 --> 04:16:06.150
WORKS -- IT

04:16:06.217 --> 04:16:07.618
COULD POTENTIALLY BE SOMETHING

04:16:07.685 --> 04:16:09.954
THAT'S EXPLORE FROM OUR BROADER

04:16:10.021 --> 04:16:12.023

L. IS SUGGESTING NIGHT KIND OF

04:18:23.054 --> 04:18:24.255
THINKING ALONG THE SAME LINES IN

04:18:24.322 --> 04:18:25.623
TERMS OF I MEAN.

THEY SOON THIS IS NOT THE LAST

04:18:27.325 --> 04:18:28.626
SET OF STEPS BECAUSE IT'S A VERY

04:18:28.693 --> 04:18:30.361
COMPLICATED THING LIKE MAYBE WE

04:18:30.428 --> 04:18:32.396
NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

04:18:32.463 --> 04:18:34.198
COME TOGETHER I REALIZE THAT YOU

04:18:34.265 --> 04:18:36.801
KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY BIG PART

04:18:36.868 --> 04:18:38.703
ADMINISTRATION BUT THE EIGHT CS

04:18:38.769 --> 04:18:39.003
WITH LA --

04:18:39.070 --> 04:18:40.004
FINANCE ME LEGISLATURE THINK

04:18:40.071 --> 04:18:41.172
ABOUT LIKE HOW WHAT'S THE BEST

04:18:41.239 --> 04:18:43.140
WAY.

04:18:43.207 --> 04:18:45.509
TO ORGANIZE THIS IN A WAY THAT

04:18:45.576 --> 04:18:47.278
WE CAN MAKE BETTER DECISIONS

04:18:47.345 --> 04:18:49.247
MORE TRANSPARENT DECISIONS THAT

04:18:49.313 --> 04:18:50.581
WE CAN DO THAT AND THAT ALSO

04:18:50.648 --> 04:18:51.649
THERE'S A COMMON UNDERSTANDING

04:18:51.716 --> 04:18:52.917
AND EXPECTATION ABOUT WHAT'S

04:18:52.984 --> 04:18:54.252
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

04:18:54.318 --> 04:18:57.989
RIGHT BECAUSE AS BECAUSE IT DOES

04:18:58.055 --> 04:19:00.424
THAT MEAN --

04:19:00.491 --> 04:19:02.660
FUND BUDGET BILLION DOLLARS IS

04:19:02.727 --> 04:19:03.995
ALSO I MEAN THE THING IS OUR

04:19:04.061 --> 04:19:05.329
MEDI CAL PROGRAM BECAUSE IT YEAH

04:19:05.396 --> 04:19:06.697
YES MOST A LOT OF ITS FROM THE

04:19:06.764 --> 04:19:07.598
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE ACTUAL

04:19:07.665 --> 04:19:09.100
GENERAL FUND PARTS ONLY.

04:19:09.166 --> 04:19:10.835
WAS A TWENTY EIGHT BILLION EIGHT

04:19:10.902 --> 04:19:11.569
THREE THREE THREE SORRY EVEN

04:19:11.636 --> 04:19:13.004
HIGHER OKAY TWENTY THREE BILLION

04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:14.772
RIGHT BUT NOT ENTIRE GENERAL

04:19:14.839 --> 04:19:16.540
FUND BUDGET IS REALLY ABOUT THE

04:19:16.607 --> 04:19:18.542
SAME SCALE WERE A LITTLE LESS IT

04:19:18.609 --> 04:19:20.111
DOES AREMEDI CAL BUDGET NOW

04:19:20.177 --> 04:19:21.012
AFTER YOU PUT ALL THE CELLS OF

04:19:21.078 --> 04:19:21.612
SO.

04:19:21.679 --> 04:19:23.114
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU SEE THIS

04:19:23.180 --> 04:19:24.649
THESE NUMBERS RUNNING ARE GOING

04:19:24.715 --> 04:19:26.250
GOING BACK AND FORTH AND AND

04:19:26.317 --> 04:19:27.618
SAID WITH THE CASH BASIS SO

04:19:27.685 --> 04:19:28.419
FORTH.

04:19:28.486 --> 04:19:30.187
MAKE HAVE HAPPY WAS LIKE OH JEEZ

04:19:30.254 --> 04:19:31.923
HOW WHAT'S THE OVER OR OR OR

04:19:31.989 --> 04:19:32.990
ACTUALLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS A

04:19:33.057 --> 04:19:34.025
TWO BILLION OPERATE AND THAT'S

04:19:34.091 --> 04:19:35.626
ONLY SO --

04:19:35.693 --> 04:19:37.228
BUT I THINK REALLY TRYING TO

04:19:37.295 --> 04:19:38.296
FIGURE THAT OUT.

04:19:38.362 --> 04:19:39.130
AND SO I THINK THIS IS AN

04:19:39.196 --> 04:19:40.898
IMPORTANT FIRST STEP AND WE WANT

04:19:40.965 --> 04:19:42.833
TO GIVE YOU THE RESOURCES TO BE

04:19:42.900 --> 04:19:43.834
ABLE TO DO THAT BUT I ALSO THINK

04:19:43.901 --> 04:19:44.335
THAT.

04:19:44.402 --> 04:19:46.070
BY COULD WE HAVE A LIKE A LARGER

04:19:46.137 --> 04:19:48.272
CONVERSATIONS LA A SUGGESTED IT.

04:19:48.339 --> 04:19:50.007
REALLY IS MUCH TO FIGURE OUT HOW

04:19:50.074 --> 04:19:51.976
THIS HOW TO DO THIS IN A WAY SO

04:19:52.043 --> 04:19:52.543
WE CAN SET APPROPRIATE

04:19:52.610 --> 04:19:54.578
EXPECTATIONS I MEAN INTERNAL

04:19:54.645 --> 04:19:56.213
FINANCIAL WORKINGS OF THE

04:19:56.280 --> 04:19:57.081
ADMINISTRATION I UNDERSTANDS

04:19:57.148 --> 04:19:57.782
GOING TO BE.

04:19:57.848 --> 04:19:59.283
BETWEEN FINANCE AND THE AGENCY

04:19:59.350 --> 04:20:01.085
AND SO FORTH BUT I THINK IN

04:20:01.152 --> 04:20:02.286
TERMS OF TRAFFIC HOW DO YOU

04:20:02.353 --> 04:20:03.621
REPORT OUT THE INFORMATION I DO

04:20:03.688 --> 04:20:05.589
SUPPORT INFORMATION AND A WHAT

04:20:05.656 --> 04:20:07.291
YOU KNOW IT AT APPROPRIATE TIMES

04:20:07.358 --> 04:20:08.359
NOW AT THE OUGHT TO JUST DO IT

04:20:08.426 --> 04:20:10.461
ONCE A YEAR IS THAT MAKES THAT

04:20:10.528 --> 04:20:10.661
THAT.

04:20:10.728 --> 04:20:11.395
MAY NOT MAKE SENSE RIGHT AND

04:20:11.462 --> 04:20:17.268
THEN YOU KNOW HOW WE BETTER

04:20:17.335 --> 04:20:18.469
COMMUNICATE --

04:20:18.536 --> 04:20:20.972
HOW THE MONEY IF DOES FLOW AND

04:20:21.038 --> 04:20:21.706
WHAT WHAT WHAT WE EXPECTING?

04:20:21.772 --> 04:20:22.573
FROM ALL THOSE DIFFERENT POTS

04:20:22.640 --> 04:20:23.607
EVERY WAIVERS SOMETHING CHANGES

04:20:23.674 --> 04:20:24.675
RIGHT EVERY THIS SOMETHING

04:20:24.742 --> 04:20:27.044
CHANGES RIGHT SO HOW HOW WE IT'S

04:20:27.111 --> 04:20:28.713
AS THOUGH THAT WERE MADE MAKING

04:20:28.779 --> 04:20:29.780
SENSIBLE.

04:20:29.847 --> 04:20:31.015
DECISIONS IN NUMBER MAKING

04:20:31.082 --> 04:20:33.851
POLICY BASED ON NOT YOU KNOW --

04:20:33.918 --> 04:20:36.620
POTENTIALLY WRONG ASSUMPTION WE

04:20:36.687 --> 04:20:37.421
DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF

04:20:37.488 --> 04:20:38.656
UNDERSTANDING WHICH IS A KNOWS

04:20:38.723 --> 04:20:40.358
PRETTY COMPLICATED.

04:20:40.424 --> 04:20:41.859
I MEAN I'LL I'LL START AND THEN

04:20:41.926 --> 04:20:43.494
CERTAINLY LET ERICA CHIME IN I

04:20:43.561 --> 04:20:45.363
THINK -- YOU

04:20:45.429 --> 04:20:46.597
KNOW I HAVE TO THE COMMAND POST

04:20:46.664 --> 04:20:49.333
ERICA AND MARY CAN'T WELL RIGHT

04:20:49.400 --> 04:20:50.835
THAT BOTH CHIEF DEPUTIES FOR YOU

04:20:50.901 --> 04:20:51.769
KNOW BOTH SIDES OF THE

04:20:51.836 --> 04:20:53.337
ORGANIZATION AND TO ERICA'S

04:20:53.404 --> 04:20:54.939
POINT EARLIER IN THAT WHAT WE'RE

04:20:55.006 --> 04:20:55.539
REALLY --

04:20:55.606 --> 04:20:57.308
TRYING TO SEXUALLY IS A CULTURAL

04:20:57.375 --> 04:20:59.577
CHANGE ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT

04:20:59.643 --> 04:21:01.579
MORE BROADLY IN TERMS OF THINGS

04:21:01.645 --> 04:21:03.414
HAPPEN AT A PROGRAM LEVEL --

04:21:03.481 --> 04:21:05.116
THAT FROM A TIMELY COMMUNICATION

04:21:05.182 --> 04:21:06.550
STANDPOINT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF

04:21:06.617 --> 04:21:07.752
THE DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF THE

04:21:07.818 --> 04:21:09.587
BUDGETING AND ACCOUNTING AND

04:21:09.653 --> 04:21:10.988
FISCAL FORECASTING --

04:21:11.055 --> 04:21:11.922
AND DEPENDING ON THE TIME FRAMES

04:21:11.989 --> 04:21:13.591
IN WHICH WE ARE CLAIMING FEDERAL

04:21:13.657 --> 04:21:14.992
FUNDS TO THE TIMING IN WHICH

04:21:15.059 --> 04:21:16.460
FEDERAL APPROVALS ARE COMING TO

04:21:16.527 --> 04:21:17.795
THE TIMING IN WHICH ARE A T.

04:21:17.862 --> 04:21:19.163
SYSTEMS CAN ACTUALLY GENERATE

04:21:19.230 --> 04:21:20.931
THE PAYMENTS OUT THE DOOR.

04:21:20.998 --> 04:21:22.700
AND THEN YOU THROW A CASH VERSUS

04:21:22.767 --> 04:21:24.368
ACCRUAL BASIS ACCOUNTING I MEAN

04:21:24.435 --> 04:21:27.538
IT'S A REMARKABLY COMPLEX --

04:21:27.605 --> 04:21:28.706
PROGRAM AND THE FACT THAT BOTH

04:21:28.773 --> 04:21:30.441
MERION ERICA HAVE BEEN LEADING

04:21:30.508 --> 04:21:32.309
THEIR RESPECTIVE TEAMS TO SIT

04:21:32.376 --> 04:21:34.378
TOGETHER TO YOU KNOW IDENTIFY

04:21:34.445 --> 04:21:35.880
AREAS WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE.

04:21:35.946 --> 04:21:37.815
BUT ALSO WORKING AS YOU KNOW

04:21:37.882 --> 04:21:39.283
FINANCE WOULD NOTE WITH FROM THE

04:21:39.350 --> 04:21:40.584
FINANCING THAT LEO AND THE

04:21:40.651 --> 04:21:43.888
LEGISLATURE WE RECOGNIZE THE

04:21:43.954 --> 04:21:46.357
IMPORTANCE OF OUR ESTIMATE.

04:21:46.424 --> 04:21:49.527
BE KNOWS INFORMATION THAT WE

04:21:49.593 --> 04:21:50.928
KNOW WHEN WE KNOW IT I'M BUT

04:21:50.995 --> 04:21:52.630
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT SO MUCH

04:21:52.696 --> 04:21:53.998
OF THE REST OF THE BUDGET IS

04:21:54.065 --> 04:21:55.533
INDICATIVE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

04:21:55.599 --> 04:21:56.867
WE ARE ACCURATE IN OUR

04:21:56.934 --> 04:21:58.636
ASSUMPTIONS --

04:21:58.702 --> 04:22:00.604
I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR --

04:22:00.671 --> 04:22:02.973
MERRY TALK ABOUT HER VISION FOR

04:22:03.040 --> 04:22:05.443
WAIVER RENEWALS AND YOU KNOW THE

04:22:05.509 --> 04:22:06.377
FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YOUR PLAN THAT

04:22:06.444 --> 04:22:08.345
JC IS WORKING WITH HER ON YOU

04:22:08.412 --> 04:22:09.680
HERE -- HER

04:22:09.747 --> 04:22:11.515
TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO CHANGE

04:22:11.582 --> 04:22:13.818
OUR RATE SETTING PROCESS WE SET

04:22:13.884 --> 04:22:15.119
SIXTEEN HUNDRED RATE CELLS A

04:22:15.186 --> 04:22:16.420
YEAR FOR EACH OF OUR MANAGED

04:22:16.487 --> 04:22:17.822
CARE PLANS ACROSS DIFFERENT

04:22:17.888 --> 04:22:19.356
POPULATIONS --

04:22:19.423 --> 04:22:21.092
THE COMPLEXITY OF JUST THE RATE

04:22:21.158 --> 04:22:22.460
IN AND OF ITSELF WHEN YOU THEN

04:22:22.526 --> 04:22:24.428
TAKE IT TO THE CASH IN THE

04:22:24.495 --> 04:22:25.930
ACCOUNTING AND THE APPROVALS AT

04:22:25.996 --> 04:22:27.298
THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

04:22:27.364 --> 04:22:28.766
THERE'S GOT TO BE --

04:22:28.833 --> 04:22:30.201
A BETTER WAY GOING FORWARD IN

04:22:30.267 --> 04:22:32.269
TERMS OF HOW WE STRUCTURE THOSE

04:22:32.336 --> 04:22:34.105
RATES AND THOSE PAYMENTS AND ALL

04:22:34.171 --> 04:22:35.906
THE OTHER KINDS OF INITIATIVES

04:22:35.973 --> 04:22:37.608
AND ADD ONS AND SUBLIMINAL --

04:22:37.675 --> 04:22:39.777
ITEMS THAT WE DO FOR HOSPITALS

04:22:39.844 --> 04:22:40.611
AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

04:22:40.678 --> 04:22:42.079
AND YOU KNOW.

04:22:42.146 --> 04:22:43.948
IT JUST REALLY COMPOUNDS AND SO

04:22:44.014 --> 04:22:45.382
I THINK YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO

04:22:45.449 --> 04:22:47.485
RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

04:22:47.551 --> 04:22:49.153
A DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP TEAM

04:22:49.220 --> 04:22:50.621
THAT IS REALLY COMMITTED.

04:30:46.897 --> 04:30:49.800
AGE IN THE ME WE NEED TO FIGURE

04:30:49.866 --> 04:30:51.201
