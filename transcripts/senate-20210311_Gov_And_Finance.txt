THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB SIX THE NEIGHBORHOOD HOMES ACT AND THE- THAT COMPLEMENT ACTUALLY GOES BOTH WAYS I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR- INCREDIBLE ATTENTION AND DEDICATION. TO HELPING US MOVE THIS BILL AND GET IT TO THIS POINT IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN DONE WITHOUT ALL OF YOUR ASSISTANCE- THIS IS A REDO OF THE BILL THAT WE WORKED ON LAST YEAR SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND IT IT IS A BILL THAT CAME OUT OF THE- SENATE HOUSING- WORKING GROUP. THAT THAT WORKED REALLY HARD TO PUT TOGETHER A PACKAGE THAT MADE SENSE TO. TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM ONE OF THE CRISIS BIG CRISIS IS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE LACK OF HOUSING PERIOD AND A LACK OF AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN PARTICULAR- IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES A STATEMENT INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION. YET THE LACK OF AVAILABLE LAND FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE BARRIERS TO BUILDING MANY OF OUR CITIES ARE BUILT OUT AND DON'T HAVE READILY AVAILABLE VACANT LAND IN OTHER CITIES ARE BASICALLY JUST RELUCTANT. TO DEVELOP HOUSING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE RICH JURISDICTIONS WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO URBAN SPRAWL SB SIX TAKES THE CONCEPT. ARTICULATED IN SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE- SO STYLE INTO. EIGHT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT TIME AND JUST PEOPLE TRAVEL. BY VEHICLE BY. SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AND REUSE AND ADAPT UNDERPERFORMING PROPERTIES TO CREATE WALKABLE COMMUNITIES AND AVOID SPRAWL. THIS ADAPTIVE REUSE BILL WILL SPUR HOUSING PRODUCTION BY AUTHORIZING RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS ON EXISTING WHAT'S CURRENTLY ZONED. FOR COMMERCIAL OFFICE AND RETAIL USE SUCH A STRIP MALLS LARGE MALLS AND BIG BOX RETAIL SPACES. SB SIX ALSO SOLVE AND EVOLVING CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS. WHICH IS SHIFTED BUSINESSES TO ACCEPT SOME PERMANENTLY NEW WORK FROM HOME STRATEGIES AND EXPANDED ONLINE TRANSACTIONS FOR CONSUMER. RETAIL NUMEROUS MAJOR COMMERCIAL TENANTS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY MAY BE FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY RELIEF OR CLOSING STORES. SUCH AS SEARS JC PENNEY'S KMART AND TOYS R. US. DUE TO THE DECLINE IN SALES AT PHYSICAL STORE LOCATIONS. WE HAVE SEEN A SHIFT IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES OVER TIME WHICH IS LEFT MANY COMMUNITIES WITH STRIP MALLS AND MALLS WITH MAJOR TENANT VACANCIES. WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE DECLINE OF RETAIL CENTER. CENTERS INCREASE BLIGHT VANDALISM AND DECLINE SALES TAX REVENUE IN MY RURAL DISTRICT THESE RETAILERS ARE OUR MAJOR TENANTS AND I EXPECT TO SEE MANY MORE RETAILERS LEAVE AS THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE. MANY CORPORATE ENTERPRISES ARE FORGOING THE BRICK AND MORTAR OPERATIONS IN FAVOR OF NEW. WORK FROM HOME REALITY. M. AND YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE TECH GIANTS FACEBOOK. AND GOOGLE WHO HAVE BEEN BURKE IN IN BRACED PERMANENT WORK FROM HOME STRATEGIES LEAVING BEHIND MASSIVE COMMERCIAL CENTERS WITH UNCERTAIN FUTURES THESE UNDER UTILIZED OR VACANT COMMERCIAL SPACES ARE ALONG MAJOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ROUTES AND CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT ACREAGE AVAILABLE TO BE DEVELOPED. FOR MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE A WALKABLE LIVE WORK PLATE PLAY VILLAGE. THE WALKABLE VILLAGE CONSTABLE ALSO HELP TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLE TRIPS RRANDS BY LOCATING SERVICES WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE. MOST SIMPLY SB SIX WILL SPUR HOUSING PRODUCTION BY ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO APPROVE RESIDENTIAL OR MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT ON COMMERCIALLY ZONED RETAIL SPACE BY UTILIZING AN EXPEDITED PROCESS. REQUIRE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TO MEET OR EXCEED THE DENSITY DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO ACCOMMODATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUCH AS APARTMENTS TOWNHOUSES AND CONDOMINIUMS AND PROVIDE FLEXIBLE FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL DECISION MAKING BY SUBJECTING THE DEVELOPMENT TO LOCAL PLANNING PARKING AND DESIGN ORDINANCE. WITH NO COST TO THE STATE. S. SIX WILL IN. RESIDENT DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT IMPACTING SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THE BILL WILL SPUR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY DURING THIS- POST- PANDEMIC. THE PERIOD OF TIME WITH ME TODAY TOMORROW AND IF I IF I COULD I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES FOR BRINGING TO MY ATTENTION A TECHNICAL FIX WHICH WILL BE MADE IN FUTURE AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT SB SIX. PROJECT MUST COMPLY WITH ALL THE REQUIREMENTS. IN THE BILL IN ORDER TO BENEFIT FROM THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.

SENATORS ARE THE FLOOR IS YOURS ON SB SIXTY THANK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU CHAIR MCGUIRE APPRECIATE IT. THIS BILL IS AS YOU MENTIONED SIMILAR TO A BILL LAST YEAR S. B. TEN FORTY NINE WHICH PASSED THIS COMMITTEE- NOT JUST PASSES COMMITTEE PASSED THE SENATE. PASSED ALL COMMITTEES IN THE ASSEMBLY GOT OFF THE SET ASSEMBLY FLOOR- BUT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE MIDNIGHT DEADLINE WAS NOT ABLE TO COME BACK FOR CONFIRMATION ON OUR SIDE SO. IT'S COMING BACK IN SIMILAR FORM IT WOULD GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MORE TOOLS TO ENFORCE ORDINANCES. THEY ADOPT REGULATING SHORT TERM RENTALS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE ECHO OF IT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN PEOPLE USING SHORT TERM RENTALS. TO OF A PUBLIC HEALTH RESTRICTIONS ON LARGE PUBLIC GATHERINGS- SHORT TERM RENTALS OFFER A WAY TO IMPROVE TOURISM AND EARNED HONOR SOME EXTRA MONEY. RECENTLY THEIR PROLIFERATION HAS ALLOWED BAD ACTORS. TO USE THE PLATFORM. TO ADVERTISE IN SECURE HOMES FOR LARGE PARTIES. OFTEN IN VIOLATION OF LOCAL ORDINANCES. POST COMPLIANCE WHICH GATHERED DATA ON SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES IN MORE THAN A HUNDRED CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES FOUND A- TWO HUNDRED AND JUNE TO SEPTEMBER COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. SO WAS A PROBLEM BEFORE AND IT'S CERTAINLY HAS GOTTEN WORSE IN THE LAST HALF OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FORTY TWO PEOPLE WERE SHOT INSIDE OR JUST OUTSIDE A SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTY NATIONWIDE SEVENTEEN PEOPLE DIED. ONE OF THE WORST OF THESE INCIDENTS HAPPENED IN MY OWN CITY OF ORINDA. WHERE FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN A MASS SHOOTING AT A LARGE HALLOWEEN PARTY IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AT A SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTY. SB SIXTY IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT GIVE CITIES AND COUNTIES THE POWER TO ENFORCE THEIR LAWS. IN A WAY THAT WILL HELP KEEP THEIR RESIDENTS SAFE. AND GET THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO ABUSE THEIR RIGHT TO RENT OUT A HOME. WITH ME TODAY TO DISCUSS THE BILL ARE ORINDA MAYOR. AMY WORTH. N. RICHARD DAY SAN LAZARO FROM EXPEDIA WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR GRAYSON AGAIN WE APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS THIS IS NOT BEEN AN EASY SUBJECT SO I THANK YOU FOR TACKLING IT THAT LAYS IN GERMAN WE'VE TO LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TODAY EACH LEAD WITNESS WILL BE GIVEN THREE MINUTES IN THE THIRTY SECOND PROBLEM. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE MAYOR FROM THE GREAT CITY OF ORINDA AMY WORST NIGHTMARE AT THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU'RE NOW IN COMMITTEE. YOUR CHAIR MCGUIRE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THIS MORNING- IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL SIXTY. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE CITIES WITH AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN MANAGING THE SHORT TERM RENTALS IN OURS. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE SO VERY GRATEFUL FOR SENATOR GLAZER. FOR SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION AND ALSO TO ALL OF YOU WHO SUPPORTED THIS- THE LAST- IN ITS LAST- ASIAN LAST YEAR. YOU WILL RECALL THE TRAGIC MURDERS ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT FIGURING DEATH THAT OCCURRED AT AN ILLEGAL GATHERING IN THE SHORT TERM RENTAL THIS UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY WAS DEVASTATING TO THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS AND TO OUR COMMUNITY. IN SHORT TERM RENTAL HOSTING PLATFORMS CAME INTO EXISTENCE MANY CITY CALIFORNIA CHOSE TO BAIL THEM COMPLETELY. IN A ROOM ON THE OTHER HAND WE CHOSE A MORE MODERATE APPROACH TO PERMIT THEM IN ADOPTED NORMAN'S THE CLEARLY OUTLINED THE RULES. THAT INCLUDED NO RENTALS FOR LARGE PARTIES IN THE REQUIREMENT THAT SHORT TERM RENTALS REGISTERED THEIR PROPERTY. OPTIONAL ORDINANCE STEPHENS WORKED WITH PROPERTY OWNERS AND NEIGHBORS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS AND COMPLAINTS WHICH REQUIRES EXTENSIVE STAFF RESOURCES BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE ADMINISTRATIVE TOOL. I DO AFFECTED ENFORCEMENT. FOLLOWING THE HALLOWEEN TRAGEDY WE FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR ORDINANCE TO RESTRICT RENTALS TO HOSTED RENTALS WHICH UNITE MINIMUMS HOWEVER REDUCE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE IS THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE RULES INTERFACES SERIOUS VIOLATIONS. COMPLIANCE SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES WITH LOCAL ZONING ORDINANCE IS THE RESPONSE TO TRUST RESPONSIBILITY OF BOTH THE PROPERTY OWNER IN THE SHORT TERM RENTAL PLATFORM. HAVING AN ADEQUATE FINE STRUCTURE IS ESSENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND ENFORCE THESE REASONABLE ORDINANCES. ARAMBULA LIKE MANY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA IS A GENERAL LAW CITY IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE SETS THE STATUTORY LIMITS REFINE. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED TO OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA TO ENFORCE THEIR SHORT TERM RENTAL ORDINANCES SH IN THE SAME FASHION THE CHARTER CITIES CURRENTLY ARE ABLE TO DO. WE RECOGNIZE THE DURING THE CALL BUT A WHOLE NEW ASPECT OF- THE RISK. INVOLVED IN ON ENFORCEABLE- SITUATIONS AROUND CALIFORNIA WETTEST TO GET INCREASED URGENCY.

FOR THANK YOU GERMAN ACQUIRE AND- MEMBERS BOB FOR A LONG ME TO PRESENT A THREE OH THREE A BILL THAT WOULD EXTEND THE TIME ALLOWED FOR THOSE WHOSE PROPERTY WAS DAMAGED OR DESTROYED BY A DISASTER TO TRANSFER THEIR BASE YEAR VALUE TO A REPLACEMENT PROPERTY. CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF WILDFIRES OVER THE YEARS. THAT HAVE DESTROYED MANY HOMES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS IS LEFT COUNTLESS RESIDENTS DISPLACED IN A FIGHT AGAINST THE CLOCK TO MEET THE FIVE YEAR DEADLINE. ALLOWED TO ACQUIRE OR CONSTRUCT A REPLACEMENT PROPERTY. AND QUALIFY FOR TRANSFER OF THEIR BASE YEAR VALUE. AT A TIME WHEN THESE DISPLACED RESIDENTS WERE BEGINNING TO PUT THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER. FOLLOWING THESE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES COVERT NINETEEN HIT BRING CRITICAL SECTORS OF GOVERNMENT IN THE ECONOMY TO A GRINDING HALT. DUE TO DELAYS AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC SOME RESIDENTS WERE NOT ABLE TO MEET THEIR DEADLINES OF REPLACING OR REBUILDING. SB THREE OH THREE WOULD RELIEVE SOME OF THE PRESSUREPUT ON THESE RESIDENTS BY EXTENDING THE DEADLINE BY TWO YEARS TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL TIME TO REBUILD. OR REQUIRE A REPLACEMENT PROPERTY. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB THREE OH THREE COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS AT CENTER BOARDS DISTRICT- IT LAST YEAR WAS JUST IMPACTED DEVASTATED BY.

WITHIN DAYS OF THE BUTTE FIRES DESTRUCTION SURVIVORS WERE BUYING OR RENTING ALL AVAILABLE PROPERTY AND THE HOUSING SUPPLY IN CALAVERAS COUNTY WAS DEPLETED. THE RESULT WAS THAT MANY WERE LEFT OUT IN THE COLD. IN THE WAKE OF THE GREAT RECESSION WE LOST MANY IF NOT MOST OF OUR RESIDENTS. WHO'D BEEN IN THE BUILDING TRADES. THAT COUPLED WITH UNCERTAINTY ABOUT DEBRIS REMOVAL AT INSURANCE SETTLEMENTS. CREATED OBSTACLES TO REBUILD. IT IS BEEN A LONG PROCESS FOR MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS WHO ARE NOW IN THE MIDST OF THAT FIVE YEAR DEADLINE. AND WE'RE NOT ALONE. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN THE BUTTE FIRE SWEPT THROUGH CALAVERAS COUNTY. IT WAS THE FOURTH MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRE IN CALIFORNIA AT THE TIME. IT GIVES ME NO PLEASURE TO NOTE THAT THE BUTTE FIRES. NOW RANKED NUMBER EIGHTEEN. SENATE BILL THREE OH THREE WILL EXTEND TO HELP HAND IS.

HEARING SEEN NINE CENTER MORTGAGE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE PLEASE. THANK YOU. TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN FIVE PRETTY ROUGH- IN ADDITION TO THE PANDEMIC WE ALL KNOW THAT- THE CREEK FIRE- LARGELY MY DISTRICT- IS CONSIDERED THE WORST WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY HAVING DESTROYED. AROUND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRES SO THIS IS BEEN DEVASTATING- TO FOOTHILL AND MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES- AND THAT IS CERTAINLY AN UNDERSTATEMENT- SOMETIMES. A STORY IS THE BEST WAY TO UNDERSTANDING THE ISSUE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE BUTTE FIRE BURNED DOWN THE HOME OF A COUPLE IN MY DISTRICT. THEY BEGIN THE REBUILDING PROCESS FOLLOWING THE FIRE IN THE FIRST ESTIMATED COMPLETION WAS IN- NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN WHICH IS FURTHER ADJUSTED- TO THE LATE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY JUST IN TIME FOR THEM TO REALIZE THE BASE VALUE TRANSFER. WHEN KOBE HIT IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY THREE THINGS HAPPENED. FIRST THE CONTRACTOR STOP CONSTRUCTION FOR A TIME FOLLOWING THE STATE RECOMMENDATIONS SECOND THE SUPPLY CHAIN SLOW DOWN. IN THIRD IN THE INTEREST OF HEALTH AND SAFETY THE CONTRACTOR LIMITED THE NUMBER OF WORKERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS ALLOWED TO WORK ON THE PROJECT ALL AT ONE TIME. ALL THESE WERE REASONABLY INTEND TO PROTECT THEM THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF WILL OF THE LABORS AS A RESULT IT'S BEEN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE FIRE THE HOUSE WAS NOT READY TO BE FINALIZED BY THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT. THIS COUPLE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO START THE REBUILDING PROJECT EARLY ENOUGH TO MEET THE DEADLINE BUT HIT A ROADBLOCK THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE FORESEEN COLLEAGUES SB THREE THREE IS NECESSARY TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE FOR THIS COUPLE IN SO MANY OTHER RATHER RESIDENTS.

I HERTZBERG BY SENATOR WIENER AYE WIENER FIVE FIVE ZERO ZERO FIVE ZERO VOTE THAT BILL IS OUT THAT BILL IS THAT WE'RE CLOSING THE ROLE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- BURGESS WE ARE NOW MOVING ON TO OUR FOURTH AND FINAL WE WILL NEED TO TAKE UP OUR CONSENT CALENDAR IS WELL BUT LET'S GO TO OUR FOURTH AND FINAL BILL OF THE DAY FOR DIRECT PRESENTATION AND THAT'S CAN BE COMING FROM OUR MAJORITY LEADER MAJORITY LEADER SENATOR HERTZBERG. THIS IS ON S. B. TWO SIXTY SEVEN ON ACTIVE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS. MAJORITY LEADER THE FLOOR IS YOURS WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE AND TO US AND WE WILL BE PRESENTING YOU WITH THE RICARDO LARA WAR TODAY. PLEASE PRESENTED TO THE LAST PERSON IN COMMITTEE EACH COMMITTEE HEARING. RITUPARNA JEEZ. THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT ALL THIS OLD GUY- YEAH. SO THE CUT WHAT WHAT THE CONSTITUTION SAYS. THAT EVERY TIME A PROPERTY TRANSFERS OR PROPERTY ADDED TO A PARTICULAR PROPERTY THE STATE HAS ABILITY TO GRAB A BITE AND TAKE TAXES OUT OF THAT. THE WE'VE PASSED THE CHANGE IN THE LAW SOME YEARS AGO IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE PUBLIC POLICY OF ENHANCING OF INCLUDING SOLAR IN PEOPLE'S HOMES AND TO TRY TO INCENTIVIZE THEM TO SAY THAT THAT SUCH AS SOLAR. INCREASE WITH DR SORRY INCLUSION INTO THE PROPERTY WOULD NOT BE. A TAXABLE EVENT THAT WOULD ADD TO YOUR ASSESSED VALUATION. CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE IN THE PRACTICAL REALITY OF IMPLEMENTATION IS. THAT THE WAY MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ACTUALLY ARMED PLACE ALL ONE PEEPERS PROPERTIES IS THE NEW PARTNERSHIPS AND THERE'S TRANSFERS WITHIN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE BASICALLY THE ECONOMIC MODELS TO. ALLOW FOR THE STUFF TO WORK AND SO THIS BILL CLARIFIES ANY CONFUSION IN THAT REGARD THAT ON THE ONE HAND SUPPORTS THE POLICY THAT SAYS IF YOU WANT TO ADD SOLAR TO YOUR HOME IT SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE ASSESSED VALUATION. AND THE OTHER HAND AVOIDS THE CONFUSION THAT'S CREATED BY WHAT'S CALLED THESE PARTNERSHIP FLIPS- IN ESSENCE WHERE OWNERSHIP SHIFTS FROM ONE TO ANOTHER BASED UPON YOUR PAYMENTS NOW YOUR HISTORY WORKS IT'S JUST SIMPLY. A MECHANISM THAT THE MARKET USES THAT PUTS LESS PRESSURE ON PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME AND INSTALL A SOLAR INTO THEIR HOMES ON THE ONE HAND. AND WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UNDERLYING PURPOSE OF THE EXCLUSION IS MET AND NOT- IMPEDED BY A STRAINED INTERPRETATION OF HOW WE FINANCE THESE THINGS AND SO THIS IS A CLARIFICATION OF THE LAW THAT'S WHY I'VE INTRODUCED IT. THAT'S ITS PURPOSE THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE RICK YOU OFF OF THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION IS ONE OF MY WITNESSES TOGETHER WITH DAN NELSON. OF A MINUTE ENERGY ANTOLINI HUNTER. Q.

IT ALLOW THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS TO BE OUR- OPTIMIZED AND MONETIZED TO ENSURE THAT THE COST OF THE OVERALL SOLAR POWER SYSTEM IS LOW AS IT CAN BE- PROVIDING THE LOWEST COST OF ENERGY TO THE CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN- ARE WE BECAME CONCERNED THAT- THE WAY THAT A PARTNERSHIP SCHLEP WORKS WE CAN AGREE COULD BE INTERPRETED TO. TRIGGER A CHANGE OF CONTROL AND THAT SUBSEQUENT LOSS OF THE PROPERTY TAX EXCLUSION. AND THE LEGISLATURE- ENACTED LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO PROTECT PARTNERSHIP SLIPS FROM.

WE HAVE AS POLICY MAKERS HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE OF CONVERTING OUR ENERGY SOURCES- TO VARIOUS TYPES OF CLEAN ENERGY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE LOSS IN TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THESE WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO DO. I WOULD SAY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THE LEGISLATURE. WHETHER IT'S RESOURCE ADEQUACY OR POLAR OR ALL THE VARIOUS KINDS OF ISSUES THAT WE FACE THESE KINDS OF. BILLS WERE TRYING TO DEAL WITH EXCLUSIONS OF SOLAR FROM ASSESSED VALUATIONS AND HAVING TO ADJUST BASED UPON THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS. ARE THE KIND OF DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING TO ENGAGE IN THE LEGISLATURE YEAR AFTER YEAR AS WE BEGIN THIS- AS WE I SHOULD SAY CONTINUE THIS SIGNIFICANT SHIFT.
