PIECES AND NINETY FIVE MASKS

00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:18.929
USED IN WILDLAND AND ALSO- IN IN

00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:21.398
OTHER ENVIRONMENTS- I CAN TELL

00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:23.833
YOU THE FIRST THING THAT MOST OF

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.201
FIREFIGHTERS WANT TO DO WHEN A

00:53:25.268 --> 00:53:28.204
GUN FIRE IS- GET THAT MASK OFF

00:53:28.271 --> 00:53:31.041
SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO WORK-

00:53:31.107 --> 00:53:33.443
ESPECIALLY IN THE WILDLAND- IT

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.913
IS VERY DIFFICULT. TO WEAR THAT

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:40.250
MASK. AND BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE

00:53:40.317 --> 00:53:42.485
WORK BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU KNOW IF

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:44.854
YOU'RE GOING UP THE HILL WITH A

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:46.656
HOSE PACK- YOU ARE CONSUMING A

00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:49.593
LOT OF- A LOT OF AIR AND YOUR

00:53:49.659 --> 00:53:53.163
BODY NEEDS A LOT OF OXYGEN AND

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:56.266
WHEN YOU'RE RESTRICTING IT WITH

00:53:56.333 --> 00:53:58.902
THE MASK. BECAUSE NUMBER- EVERY

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:01.071
OF MINUTES FOR MINUTES IN OTHER

00:54:01.137 --> 00:54:03.473
WORDS YOU WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.608
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT OSHO WAS

00:54:04.674 --> 00:54:07.110
RECOGNIZING WHEN THEY SET THE

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:08.511
STANDARDS THAT THEY DO AN OSHA

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:12.282
IS VERY VERY- THEY'RE VERY

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:15.085
DILIGENT WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT

00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:17.787
STANDARDS IT'S VERY HARD TO THEM

00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:21.024
SOMETIMES WE FEEL THAT SOME OF

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:21.458
THEIR STANDARDS ARE

00:54:21.524 --> 00:54:23.893
UNREASONABLE- THE TESTING FOR

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.830
THESE IF IT'S NOT DONE CORRECTLY

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:29.799
OPENS UP EVERY AGENCY TO

00:54:29.866 --> 00:54:33.136
LAWSUITS- AND IT'S NOT A- EASY

00:54:33.203 --> 00:54:34.437
PROCESS. IT'S NOT A CHEAP

00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:38.908
PROCESS IT'S VERY VERY COSTLY-

00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:40.310
AND HAS TO BE DONE ONCE A YEAR

00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:42.145
AND IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:45.315
THE PERSON HAS THE PROPER FIT IF

00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:47.884
THEY LOSE WEIGHT. OF THEIR OF

00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:49.886
CONFIGURATION INTERFACE CHANGES

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.354
THEN THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:55.058
THAT PROCESS AGAIN. SO YOU KNOW

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:55.725
A LOT OF THIS IS REALLY

00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:58.028
PROBLEMATIC- I THINK OSHA SET

00:54:58.094 --> 00:55:00.797
STANDARDS FOR PURPOSE AND- I

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:05.268
THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO-

00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:07.137
TO NOT GO BEYOND AN OSHA. AND

00:55:07.203 --> 00:55:09.039
TRY TO LIVE. THESE TYPES SAFETY

00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:10.940
HAZARDS FROM FROM THE

00:55:11.007 --> 00:55:12.976
LEGISLATURE AS OPPOSED TO AN

00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:15.545
ORGANIZATION THAT IS ALL ABOUT

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:18.348
WORKER SAFETY AND- SO FOR THAT

00:55:18.415 --> 00:55:20.984
REASON- I'M GONNA BE OPPOSING

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:23.186

OUR CLIMATE CONTINUES TO CHANGE

00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:33.363
AND AS WE ARE FACED WITH NOT

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.364
JUST A THREAT THAT WE'RE SEEING

00:55:34.431 --> 00:55:35.832
TODAY BUT INCREASED THREATS-

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:37.434
COMING OVER TIME- WORKING ON

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.736

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:41.871
WORKING ON ASKING- SAID TO

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:43.339
UPDATE SOME OF THE STANDARDS I

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:46.710

REMINDING THEM A KEY ALLY. OF

00:55:58.354 --> 00:56:00.256
TWO HUNDRED- WAS A LITTLE BIT

00:56:00.323 --> 00:56:01.391
ABOVE WHAT I THINK WE WERE EVEN

00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:03.727
EXPERIENCING HERE DOWN THE

00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:04.661

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:08.298
COULD SMELL THAT AND WE CONTAINS

00:56:08.364 --> 00:56:09.365
THAT. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A

01:38:34.608 --> 01:38:37.011
ISSUE KEY ISSUE FOR US IS THIS.

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:38.712
WE ARE NOT OF THE SAME SITUATION

TOWARDS AN ENDEMIC STATUS. I

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:57.298
WHICH WAS DENOUNCED I BELIEVE

01:38:57.364 --> 01:38:58.432
SIX WEEKS AGO. SO WE REALLY LOOK

01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:02.636
AT THIS AS A POINT WHERE TO SAY

01:39:02.703 --> 01:39:02.770
.

01:39:02.836 --> 01:39:03.704

01:39:04.805 --> 01:39:06.340

DEVELOPING ARTISTS. IT'S SIMPLY

01:58:53.759 --> 01:58:55.495
UNTRUE THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES

01:58:55.561 --> 01:58:58.831

01:59:15.414 --> 01:59:17.783
ELIMINATES THE LABELS RECOURSE

THAT TIME. THAT'S A PRETTY

01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:27.693
RADICAL AND UNSUSTAINABLE NOTION

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:29.562
TO TAKE AWAY ONE SIDE'S ABILITY

BUT IT MIGHT- HELP TO SOLVE ONE

02:09:17.182 --> 02:09:18.283
AND THEN REALLY FOR THE DEBATE

02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:19.585
THE OTHER IS THAT THAT MIGHT

02:09:19.651 --> 02:09:21.487

MANY- MEETING WITH MANY OF THE

02:13:26.698 --> 02:13:28.633
PROPOSED SITE FROM BOTH SIDES. I

02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:31.036
HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE ALSO IN

02:13:31.103 --> 02:13:32.771
OUR COLLEAGUE WHO CHAIR CHUCK-

02:13:32.838 --> 02:13:35.607
KALRA WHO HAS TAKEN ON THIS

02:13:35.674 --> 02:13:37.476
RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO FIND

02:13:37.542 --> 02:13:40.045
THE RIGHT SOLUTION THE RIGHT

02:13:40.112 --> 02:13:41.546
BALANCE. OF WHEN WE HAVE TWO

02:13:41.613 --> 02:13:43.915

SIDES. IF THEY ARE BOTH.

02:13:49.221 --> 02:13:53.325
NEGOTIATING FROM THE SAME LEVEL

02:13:53.392 --> 02:13:54.893

NEGOTIATING FROM THE SAME LEVEL

02:14:01.233 --> 02:14:02.801
THEN THERE IS A PROBLEM THERE

02:14:02.868 --> 02:14:04.803
AND I THINK SOMETIMES IT IS THE

02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:05.837
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

02:14:05.904 --> 02:14:07.506
LEGISLATURE TO THEN LOOK AT

02:14:07.572 --> 02:14:10.375
THOSE CONTRACTS. TO DETERMINE IF

02:14:10.442 --> 02:14:12.778
THERE IS. UNFAIRNESS THEN WE DO

02:14:12.844 --> 02:14:16.214
NEED TO STEP IN TO HELP PICK IN

02:14:16.281 --> 02:14:18.383
IT IN IN THAT PROCESS. A

02:14:18.450 --> 02:14:19.985
CONTRACT IS A CONTRACT AND IF

02:14:20.051 --> 02:14:21.653
YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY OF

02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:24.122
RESPONSIBILITY WE ALSO KNOW THAT

02:14:24.189 --> 02:14:25.056
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CONTRACTS

02:14:25.123 --> 02:14:26.958
IN THE PAST THAT HAVE BEEN

02:14:27.025 --> 02:14:27.726
ILLEGAL CONTRACTS. AND I WON'T

02:14:27.793 --> 02:14:32.030
GO INTO ONE BELIEVER THAT. WE

02:14:32.097 --> 02:14:33.999
WANT TO SOLUTION TO THIS WITHOUT

02:14:34.065 --> 02:14:35.834
A DOUBT- THE VERY FIRST COMMENT

02:14:35.901 --> 02:14:38.136
FROM MY COLLEAGUE WAS HOW

02:14:38.203 --> 02:14:40.405
IMPORTANT THE INDUSTRY IS. BOTH

02:14:40.472 --> 02:14:43.442
IN. THE FILM INDUSTRY AND THE

02:14:43.508 --> 02:14:45.076
RECORDING INDUSTRY SO IMPORTANT

02:14:45.143 --> 02:14:48.180
TO CALIFORNIA. AND TO HAVE BOTH

02:14:48.246 --> 02:14:50.415
PARTIES BE ABLE TO MEET TOGETHER

02:14:50.482 --> 02:14:51.750
AND I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT

02:14:51.817 --> 02:14:53.351
THAT THIS IS GOING TO THE ARTS

02:14:53.418 --> 02:14:54.719
AND ENTERTAINMENT. COMMITTEE AND

02:14:54.786 --> 02:14:58.256
I KNOW THAT- CHAIR-

02:14:58.323 --> 02:14:59.491
BOERNER HORVATH IS LOOKING

02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:01.993
FORWARD. MAYBE THAT'S NOT THE

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:03.962

YEAR YOUR SIDES. BUT I THINK

02:15:09.734 --> 02:15:11.436
THAT THIS BILL ABSOLUTELY

02:15:11.503 --> 02:15:14.806
DESERVES TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT

02:15:14.873 --> 02:15:17.175
THE CONVERSATIONS CAN CONTINUE

02:15:17.242 --> 02:15:18.310
SO THAT THE PARTIES CAN THEN

02:15:18.376 --> 02:15:20.378
DETERMINE HOW BEST TO THAT

02:15:20.445 --> 02:15:22.581
PRESENTED. TO THE BODY WHEN WE

02:15:22.647 --> 02:15:25.016
TAKE TO THE FLOOR. SO WITH THAT

02:15:25.083 --> 02:15:28.620
I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU

02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:32.824
VERY MUCH. RIGHT AND I. TO WOULD

02:15:32.891 --> 02:15:34.326
LIKE TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ON

02:15:34.392 --> 02:15:36.161
THIS I DON'T KNOW THIS BUSINESS

02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:38.830
MODEL OF JUST. WHETHER IT'S ON

02:15:38.897 --> 02:15:41.566
THE ON THE- PRODUCTION SIDE OF

02:15:41.633 --> 02:15:43.101
REDDISH RECORDS OR WHETHER IT'S

02:15:43.168 --> 02:15:46.538
MOVIES- I KNOW ARE YOU KNOW WHEN

02:15:46.605 --> 02:15:48.106
I ASKED ABOUT RETURN ON

02:15:48.173 --> 02:15:50.008
INVESTMENTS. FOR R&amp;D I KNOW WHAT

02:15:50.075 --> 02:15:51.142
IT'S LIKE IN OTHER BUSINESS

02:15:51.209 --> 02:15:52.978
ENTITIES WHEN YOU PUT THAT

02:15:53.044 --> 02:15:55.514
INVESTMENT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:57.249

02:15:57.315 --> 02:15:58.917
DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT IS TO BE

02:15:58.984 --> 02:16:01.653
GREAT. THE BEST FORMULA FOR

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:04.356
STUDIOS AND MUSIC COMPANIES TO

02:16:04.422 --> 02:16:06.858
BE ABLE TO GET BACK THERE ARE A

02:16:06.925 --> 02:16:08.827
WIDE TO RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

02:16:08.894 --> 02:16:10.829
AND BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

02:16:10.896 --> 02:16:13.732
BANKRUPT DAYS AT IT WILL BE

02:16:13.798 --> 02:16:16.835
IDIOTS LIKE PUT A GUN TO OUR

02:16:16.902 --> 02:16:18.803
HEADS IF WE WERE TO TRY TO

02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:19.571
BANKRUPT IN. INDUSTRY THAT IS

02:16:19.638 --> 02:16:21.172
NOT ANYTHING ANYBODY UP HERE

02:16:21.239 --> 02:16:23.375
WANTS TO DO OR ANYBODY IN THE

02:16:23.441 --> 02:16:24.376
CAPITAL- YOU ARE THRIVING

02:16:24.442 --> 02:16:26.177
INDUSTRY THAT KEEPS US AFLOAT

02:16:26.244 --> 02:16:29.814
AND ALIVE. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU

02:16:29.881 --> 02:16:31.049
HAVE TO STINK OUT COMPENSATION

02:16:31.116 --> 02:16:33.418
AND IN MY- YOU KNOW I. I RETIRED

02:16:33.485 --> 02:16:34.953
FROM THE CITY OF LA AND SOMEBODY

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:37.289
MAKING THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

02:16:37.355 --> 02:16:38.390
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND- IF YOU DO

02:16:38.456 --> 02:16:40.659
IT CHILDREN SO IT'S TWO HUNDRED

02:16:40.725 --> 02:16:42.527
FIFTY THOUSAND THAT'S A LOT OF

02:16:42.594 --> 02:16:46.064
pIN IN MY MIND- AS YOU WERE

02:16:46.131 --> 02:16:47.966
SAYING THEY GET. WELL

02:16:48.033 --> 02:16:50.268
COMPENSATED. SO IN IN MY WORLD

02:16:50.335 --> 02:16:52.771
IN MY MIND IF YOU TALK TO ANY

02:16:52.837 --> 02:16:54.973
OF. ANY CIVIL SERVANTS IN HIS

02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:56.841
BUILDING. THEY WOULD. THEY WOULD

02:16:56.908 --> 02:16:58.577
RAISE THEIR EYEBROWS AT THAT

02:16:58.643 --> 02:17:00.979
THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. BUT AT THE

02:17:01.046 --> 02:17:03.982
SAME TIME WHERE MY CONFUSION

02:17:04.049 --> 02:17:07.719
COMES WHEN I ASKED ABOUT- HE TO

02:17:07.786 --> 02:17:10.322
GET TELEVISION THE TO YOU BUT

02:17:10.388 --> 02:17:11.890
WHEN ASKED ABOUT CYNTHIA NIXON

02:17:11.957 --> 02:17:14.292
WHOSE IN DOVER WHAT'S THAT THE

02:17:14.359 --> 02:17:17.195
GOLDEN AGE AND- AND JUST LIKE

02:17:17.262 --> 02:17:19.030
THAT SHE'S IN TWO DIFFERENT

02:17:19.097 --> 02:17:20.799
MAJOR PRODUCTIONS BUT I'M ALSO

02:17:20.865 --> 02:17:22.934
HEARINGS EXCLUSIVITY THAT WE

02:17:23.001 --> 02:17:25.570

02:17:25.637 --> 02:17:28.006
BOTH THE MAJOR MAJOR- PRODUCTION

02:17:28.073 --> 02:17:29.941
SO HOW DID SHE GET A DIFFERENT

02:17:30.008 --> 02:17:31.943
DEAL WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:33.745
EXCLUSIVITY HERE TO CHOOSE THE

02:17:33.812 --> 02:17:35.747
STUDIO'S REALLY WANT THE SAME

02:17:35.814 --> 02:17:37.349

BRIANNA OR THEY MAY TO RE ON AND

02:17:45.457 --> 02:17:45.957
THE FACT THAT SHE DOES. THE

02:17:46.024 --> 02:17:47.492
RIGHT MAKE UP AND MOVIES AND

02:17:47.559 --> 02:17:50.562
THIS AND THAT AND SHE MAY OR MAY

02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:52.831
NOT HAVE COMPLETED ALL OF HER

02:17:52.897 --> 02:17:54.165
ALBUMS AT THE SAME I BET SHE'S-

02:17:54.232 --> 02:17:55.634
TO THE RECORDING INDUSTRY SO

02:17:55.700 --> 02:18:00.238
DOES THAT EXTEND HER TIME- AS

02:18:00.305 --> 02:18:02.140
FAR AS BEING UNDER CONTRACT AND

02:18:02.207 --> 02:18:03.508
HOW IS THAT MONEY GETS SPLIT UP

02:18:03.575 --> 02:18:08.413
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY DON'T.

02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:10.248
SHARE IN IT BUT THE RECORDING.

02:18:10.315 --> 02:18:11.016
FOURTEEN THE ARE SAYING YOU'RE-

02:18:11.082 --> 02:18:12.517
SO THAT'S WHERE MY- I'M GETTING

02:18:12.584 --> 02:18:13.652
MIXED INFORMATION I DIDN'T HAVE

02:18:13.718 --> 02:18:15.587
ENOUGH TIME TO BE ACTUALLY DELVE

02:18:15.654 --> 02:18:18.123
INTO IT TO ACTUALLY GET- WHAT'S

02:18:18.189 --> 02:18:20.759
REALLY REALLY GOING ON- WITH

02:18:20.825 --> 02:18:22.894
SWITCH YOUR WITH YOUR CONTRACT

02:18:22.961 --> 02:18:24.562
IN YOUR WORLD. I REALLY WOULD

02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:27.432
LIKE FOR THIS TO BE BIFURCATED

02:18:27.499 --> 02:18:30.335
AND I THINK THE- CHAIRMAN WILL

02:18:30.402 --> 02:18:32.337
PROBABLY ADDRESS SOME OF THAT-

02:18:32.404 --> 02:18:35.106
AS WEAK AS YOU MOVE FORWARD- BUT

02:18:35.173 --> 02:18:37.842
FOR ME. IT'S REALLY ABOUT TRYING

02:18:37.909 --> 02:18:40.278
TO FIND OUT WHAT REALLY. WORKS

02:18:40.345 --> 02:18:43.948
FOR BOTH SIDES. AND WELL WHILE I

02:18:44.015 --> 02:18:45.550
MAY WANT THIS TO COME GET OUT OF

02:18:45.617 --> 02:18:48.153
THIS COMMITTEE IF IT MAKES IT TO

02:18:48.219 --> 02:18:49.921
THE FLOOR. I MAY HAVE A

02:18:49.988 --> 02:18:51.289
DIFFERENT. LOOK AT IT BUT WE

02:18:51.356 --> 02:18:52.691
DEFINITELY NEED TO MAKE SURE IT

02:18:52.757 --> 02:18:54.426
DOESN'T STOP HERE. AND THAT WE

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:56.361
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BUT

02:18:56.428 --> 02:18:57.829
MOST IMPORTANT THAT WE THIS

02:18:57.896 --> 02:18:59.964
COMMITTEE AND EVERY MEMBER AT

02:19:00.031 --> 02:19:01.299
THIS POINT. MEMBER THE NEXT TO

02:19:01.366 --> 02:19:04.069
ME BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IF IT

02:19:04.135 --> 02:19:05.537
MAKES IT TO THE FLOOR. THAT

02:19:05.603 --> 02:19:08.373
EVERY MEMBER REALLY UNDERSTANDS-

02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:10.942
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL YOU ARE. IF

02:19:11.009 --> 02:19:13.812
YOU'RE A BUSINESS MODEL. FOR THE

02:19:13.878 --> 02:19:14.379
AVERAGE AMERICAN THE AVERAGE

02:19:14.446 --> 02:19:16.047
CALIFORNIANS PROBABLY DIDN'T

02:19:16.114 --> 02:19:17.549
MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:19:17.615 --> 02:19:19.651
TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF MONEY AND

02:19:19.718 --> 02:19:21.352
BUT YOU TALK ABOUT IN A WAY.

02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:25.090
WHERE IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY

02:19:25.156 --> 02:19:27.959
AND SO- BUT IF IT WOULD HELP US

02:19:28.026 --> 02:19:31.329
TO UNDERSTAND- WHY THINGS HAVE

02:19:31.396 --> 02:19:33.998
BEEN WORKING IN THE PAST. AND

02:19:34.065 --> 02:19:34.799
HOPEFULLY THERE'S A GOOD

02:19:34.866 --> 02:19:38.803
DIALOGUE WITH THE ARTIST. THE

02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:40.438
EMPLOYEES WHY IS NOT WORK FOR

02:19:40.505 --> 02:19:44.175
THEM THE SEVEN YEAR- I DID NOT

LEAVE YOU WITH THIS BECAUSE THIS

02:19:45.577 --> 02:19:48.079
WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME-

02:19:48.146 --> 02:19:50.548
AND NOT THAT I'M NOT DISCOUNTING

02:19:50.615 --> 02:19:51.950
THE MOTION PICTURE SIDE OF IT

02:19:52.016 --> 02:19:54.119
BUT THIS IS THIS IS PROBABLY A

02:19:54.185 --> 02:19:56.254
AN EXAMPLE OF WHY I'M- I'M I'M

02:19:56.321 --> 02:19:58.323
NOT TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S

02:19:58.389 --> 02:20:01.760
GOING ON HERE. WHERE WHAT THE

02:20:01.826 --> 02:20:04.429
ALBUM IS AN ALBUM THAT ALBUM TO

02:20:04.496 --> 02:20:07.298
ME THE BUNCH OF RECORDS I GIVE

02:20:07.365 --> 02:20:10.135
IT TO YOU IT'S AN ALBUM. BUT IF

THIRTEEN SONGS AND I GIVE YOU

02:20:14.205 --> 02:20:15.874

AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.169
