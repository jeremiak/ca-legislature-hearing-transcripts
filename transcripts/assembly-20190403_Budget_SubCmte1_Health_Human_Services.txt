AND IF WE COULD DO IT IN THE ORDER LISTED. THAT IS SO MUCH EASIER FOR EVERYONE TO FOLLOW. DEPARTMENT WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AT KIM JOHNSON DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES I'LL START WITH JUST A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW AND THEN HAD TO YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PLEASURE OF THE AT THE GROUP. SO YES TEMAS CASELOADS ARE DECLINING NATIONWIDE CALIFORNIA IS ON A MUCH LOWER DOWNWARD TREND IN OTHER STATES BUT SINCE THE PEAK OF THE COW WORKS CASELOAD ALMOST SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN JUST AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION THE TOTAL CASELOAD HAS BEEN DECLINING. ALONG WITH CALIFORNIA'S IMPROVING ECONOMY. AND THE GRANT INCREASES IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SLOW THAT NATURAL CASELOAD DECLINE AND ALLOWED FAMILIES WHO EARN MORE INCOME TO STAY IN THE PROGRAM. FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CDSS PROJECTS THE BASE CASELOAD FOR THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO DECREASE BY 8% FROM THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR. AND THE CASE LOAD FOR THAT NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR TO DECREASE BY SIX POINT 9% FROM EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVELS. THE CALIFORNIA TEN OF POVERTY RATE IS THE HIGHEST RATIO NATIONWIDE BY MORETHAN A 10% MARGINS THE MEETING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE STRONGEST DEMONSTRATION OF ANY PROGRAM IN THE NATION OF ENGAGING AND SERVING FAMILIES IN POVERTY. NARROWING FURTHER INTO THE CASE LOAD TO EXPLORE CHILDREN POVERTY CAO WORKS THERE'S EVEN MORE IN TOUCH IS MORE THAN 80% OF CALIFORNIA'S IMPOVERISHED YOUTH BUT WE STILL CAN DO BETTER. EVEN WITH THESE POSITIVE TRENDS IN FACT THE STATE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ONGOING EFFORTS IN AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT WE CONSTANTLY STRIVE TO BE THE BEST POSSIBLE PARTNER FOR THE COUNTIES AT AND PEOPLE. ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO OVER THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS I IN A GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE INCREASES TO THE CAL WORKS GRANT LEVELS WE'VE ALSO MADE SOME MODIFICATIONS TO THE BUDGETING METHODOLOGY. OF THE COW WORK SINGLE ALLOCATION TO ENSURE THE RESOURCES ARE THERE TO SERVE OUR POPULATIONS WE'VE ALSO LAUNCHED A TWO GENERATION APPROACH FOR THE K. AND CAL WORKS AT IN OUR KIDS AND SERVING FAMILIES IMPLEMENTING THE COW WORK SOME VISITING INITIATIVE. AND WERE ALSO SET TO LAUNCH OUR CAO WORKS OUT COMES AN ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW. AT TO ENSURE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACROSS THE PROGRAM SO THAT'S OUR OUR OVERVIEW AND WHAT'S HAPPENING AND CAL WORKS. AND AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THE GRANT INCREASE PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY IN THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA. SURE. YES PLEASE SURE SO WE ARE IT JUST ACTUALLY THIS MONTH APRIL OF THIS YEAR WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE 10% ACROSS THE BOARD GRANT INCREASE. AGREED UPON THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE THIS GRANT INCREASE APPLIES TO ALL CAO WORKS CASES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT ASSISTANCE UNIT LIVES IN REGION ONE OR TWO AND REGARDLESS OF THE EXEMPT OR NOT EXEMPT STATUS THAT THE PARTICIPANTS. THE BUDGET PROPOSES A SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT INCREASE THE CALYX GRANT LEVELS BY 131% EFFECTIVE OCTOBER. OF THIS YEAR AND THAT WILL BRING A MONTHLY GRANT PAYMENTS 250% -- FOR A PORTION OF THAT CASE LOAD -- THE QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA SPECIFICALLY ASK ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE ON TO SOME OF THE PROPOSALS AT THE LA -- AND AT DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES THAT WERE APPROACHED -- SPECIFICALLY THE THIRD OPTION I'M FOR THE GRANT LEVEL INCREASE THAT IS. COULD BE OPERATIONAL THAT WAS THE QUESTION POSED TO US IT IS AB ABLE TO BE OPERATIONAL IT IS A SIGNIFICANT COST OVER WHAT THE CURRENT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES -- IN TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTION AB ASSISTANT UNIT SIZES ACROSS THE COW WORKS CASELOAD THE GRANT INCREASE PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR HAS THE LARGEST IMPACT ON THE LARGEST PERCENT OF THE CASELOAD WHICH IS AT ASSISTANT UNIT SIZES OF TWO AND THREE WHICH IS. ABOUT 50% 56% OF THE CASELOAD -- THE FAMILIES THAT WILL BE -- FURTHEST AWAY FROM 50% OF FEDERAL POPULAR EVER AFTER THIS THIRTEEN POINT 1% INCREASE ARE THOSE THAT ARE SYSTEM YOU UNITS OF SIZE OF ONE AND THAT'S ABOUT THANK YOU. NEXT WILL BE ADDITION TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. NO SIR STILL ON THE SHOW. ONE SAID THE I THINK THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION WE WANT TO GET THROUGH THE GENDER BUT WE WANT. TO ONE THANK YOU. I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED RELATED -- TO CASELOAD IN PACKS -- WITH A CONCENTRATION OF CASES WITHOUT AN EIGHT EIGHT ADULTS SO IN. EXCLUDING SANCTION CASELY AT CASES THAT AGAIN IS THIS THE ASSISTANCE UNIT SIZE OF ONE APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE ASSISTANT UNIT SIZE OF ONE OR CASES ABOUT NEEDED ADULT. SO I THINK THAT ANSWERS THE I THINK AFTER HERE FOR MR HELD THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS. BUT FOR NOW -- PLEASE MR HELD UP. PARDON ME MADAM CHAIR THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM A LA OFFERS -- MY NAME IS MIKE CAROLYN THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO TALK ABOUT. ON THE CONVERSE RAN CREASES -- MISTER AS LANEY AND WHO'S THE OTHER WITNESS ON THIS IS GOING TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK SOARED ABOUT THE HISTORICAL NATURE OF THE GRANT LEVELS -- AND HOW THEY HAVE KINDA EBBED AND FLOWED WITH -- OF THE POVERTY LEVEL AND ON YOU KNOW IN TIMES OF RECESSION WE'VE HAD TO DECREASE THEM -- AND OBVIOUSLY IN THE PAST WE HAD GRANT LEVELS OR MUCH HIGHER MUCH CLOSER TO THEIR ACTUAL NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS SO THEY'LL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT IN A MOMENT. I'M MY COMMENTS THE WERE REALLY GOING TO FOCUS MORE ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND FIRST AT THE OUTSET -- I THINK -- WE JUST WANT TO TAKE THIS MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE THE ENORMOUS PROGRESS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE THE ADMINISTRATION ARE MAKING ON GRANTS I MEAN TWO DAYS AGO WE INCREASE GRANTS BY 10% I'VE BEEN IN THIS JOB I BELIEVE FIFTEEN YEARS. IT'S THE SINGLE LARGEST GRAN INCREASE. ABOUT I'VE EVER WITNESSED -- IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL IT WAS A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS TO GROUP OF CAL WORKS -- STUDENT PARENTS A FEW WEEKS AGO AND THEY WERE ECSTATIC WHEN I TOLD THEY'RE GOING TO BE GETTING GRANT INCREASES SO THISIS A VERY IMPORTANT THING FOR RECIPIENTS. AND GOVERNOR NEW SOME IN HIS FIRST BUDGET CAME OUT IN. TO GET EVEN OF A BIG STEP FURTHER INCREASING THE GRANTS PROPOSING ANOTHER THIRTEEN POINT 1% INCREASE IN THE GRANTS THAT WOULD BEGIN THIS OCTOBER. AND SO -- I YOU KNOW WE MADE AN AGREEMENT ALL OF US LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO IN DEEP POVERTY IN THE CALLER'S PROGRAM. AND IT WAS REALLY GREAT TO SEE THE GOVERNOR KEEPING THAT COMMITMENT -- AND SO WE WANT TO JUST PUT THAT OUT ON THE TABLE IS THAT WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT REALLY APPRECIATE -- THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD -- WE HOWEVER WE ALSO WOULD RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE RECONSIDER EXACTLY HOW WE PROVIDE THIS THIS GRANT AMOUNT WE IT'S US RATHER SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND THE WAY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TO DO IT IS TO ESSENTIALLY DO THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE GRAN INCREASES WHICH IS TO DO IT ON ACROSS THE BOARD THIRTEEN POINT 1% INCREASE. FOR EACH OF THE HOUSEHOLD SIZE IS THAT WE HAVE IN THE COLLEGE PROGRAM -- AND ALL OF THOSE FAMILIES NEED INCREASES THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT THEY COULD ALL USE ALL THIRTEEN POINT 1% OF IT. BUT WHEN WE ASSESS THE VARIOUS NEEDS OF OUR FAMILIES WHAT WE SEE IS A VERY LARGE GAP. BETWEEN -- WHAT WE CALL A ONE PERSON CAL WORKS HOUSEHOLD AND THE TWO PERSON GRANT LEVEL -- IT'S IT'S A A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ALMOST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A ONE PERSON GRANT AND A TWO PERSON GRANT. BUT THE NOTION OF A ONE PERSON GRANT IS REALLY KIND OF A FICTION -- THERE ARE NO ONE PERSON GRANTS THEY'RE ALL TO PARENT THEY'RE ALL TWO PERSON HOUSEHOLD THAT MINIMUM BECAUSE WHAT ONE PERSON GRAN IS IS ESSENTIALLY -- OF A CHILD ONLY CASE WHERE WE HAVE ONE CHILD ELIGIBLE IN THE HOUSEHOLD BUT WE ALSO HAVE AN ADULT AT LEAST ONE ADULT IN THAT HOUSEHOLD. SO WE WOULD REALLY STRONGLY ENCOURAGE AN APPROACH THAT WOULD TRY TO RAISE ALL GRANT LEVELS I THINK THE ONLY -- MADE THIS RECOMMENDATION IN THEIR IN THEIR REPORT REYES ALL GRANT LEVELS UP ALL THE GRANTS WE DISTRIBUTE THE MONEY IN A WAY THAT WOULD GET ALL THE VARIOUS HOUSEHOLD LEVELS UP 240%. INCLUDING THAT ONE SO CALL ONE PERSON HOUSEHOLD SO THAT WE REALLY GIVE A SUBSTANTIAL BUMP TO THAT HOUSEHOLD INCOME BECAUSE WE REALLY FEEL THAT. I THINK IT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I I COULD BE WRONG SLIGHTLY ON THIS I THINK IT'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT DOLLARS A MONTH IS WHAT THAT INCREASE WOULD GO. TO THAT'S JUST IT'S IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR A FAMILY A TWO PERSON FAMILY TO BE ABLE TO EXIST AND RENT HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AT SUCH A LOW GROUND LEVEL. I MEAN THE GOOD THE GRANT INCREASE STILL WON'T GET US TO THE PLACE THAT WE NEED TO BE BUT I THINK WE WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE REDISTRIBUTION THAT WAS SUGGESTED BY THE LA L.. THAT WOULD MAKE THE GRANT LEVELS HIGHER. FOR MAKING EQUAL FOR ALL CASELOAD SIZES HOUSEHOLD SIZE AND THEN -- EXPRESSLY LIFT THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD GO TO THE ONE PERSON HOUSEHOLDS SO THAT'S OUR PROPOSAL AND WE ALSO -- WOULD CERTAINLY -- SUPPORT OF FURTHER AUGMENTATION OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET -- TO BE ABLE TO GO EVEN HIGHER BECAUSE AS GOOD AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS IT'S NOT QUITE WHAT WE AGREED TO LAST YEAR -- ON A BUDGET YOU'RE BASIS I BELIEVE IT WOULD REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF ABOUT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ACTUALLY GET US TO GO 250% -- TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION OVER A FULL YEAR BUDGET FOR TWO IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THAT WAS THE COMMITMENT THAT WE ALL GREE TO LAST YEAR AND WHILE THE THIRTEEN POINT 1% INCREASE IS SUBSTANTIAL AND GOOD. IT IS A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF WHERE WE WERE HOPING TO GET IN THIS BUDGET YEAR SO AGAIN WE WOULD RECOMMEND TRYING TO HAVE. TO LOOK AT HAVING WELL A SLIGHTLY LARGER -- AUGMENTATION AN INCREASE IN THE GRANT LEVELS IN THIS BUDGET YEAR. THANK YOU MISTER HERALD AND WHILE -- KEVIN A SLANEY IN -- IS COMING UP. WHAT IT WOULD TAKE ROLE FOR ESTABLISH A QUORUM PLACE? MISS RAY IS HERE MISTER FRAZIER. MR MATHIS MISTER PATTERSON. MR RAMEAU'S. MISS RUBIO. DOCTOR WOULD [inaudible] QUORUM [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR THE THERE ARE SOME RESPECTIVE THANK YOU MY NAME'S KEVIN AS THE NEW THANKS FOR INVITING ME. YOU SHOULD OPPORTUNITY. I REPRESENT THE COLDEST OF CALIFORNIA WHAT FOR RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN REPRESENTING BOTH OF YOU SIT BINS. SINCE THE PREVIOUS CENTURY OF NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND ONGOING. THE FACT I WAS AROUND IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE OKAY A FDC WE GOT A COST OF LIVING INCREASE AND THE AND THE AND THE LEGISLATION. AND THE COOK AND WE GOT A COLA. SINCE THEN FOR THE PAST TWO CENTURIES -- ARC OF BENEFITS HAVE BEEN UNDER ATTACK. WE WERE ATTACKED I HAVE A TABLE ONE OVER HERE THAT SHOWS. THAT THE FIRST ATTACK CAME IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND EIGHTY ONE WHEN JERRY BROWN BECAME GOVERNOR HE WE JUST UP BENEFITS BY TWO POINT 1%. THEN IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO IT WAS SO WITH THOSE THE BY FIVE POINT 8%. THEN AGAIN TWO POINT 7%. EIGHT POINT 9%. AND THEIR SCHWARZENEGGER REDUCE THAT BY 4% AND FINALLY WIPED OUT THE COLDER. AND WHEN JERRY BROWN CAME IN. HE WITH THOSE THAT AGAIN BY 8% AGAIN. AND THE PAST TWO THREE YEARS WE'VE GOTTEN MAYBE 20% 225% BACK SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- BIT. THE AVERAGE CAL WORKS GRANT TODAY. FOR A FAMILY OF THREE IS FIVE SIXTY EIGHT A MONTH AND WHEN I SAY TODAY I MEAN MARCH. BECAUSE IN A POLL. ED AND THAT'S REPRESENTS 32% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. FOR THE AVERAGE CAL WORKS FAMILY. IN A POOR ONE AND ONE UP 235% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. IN OCTOBER WANT THE NEW SIM INCREASE GOES INTO EFFECT. AND THAT BRINGS IT UP 238% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. SO WE STILL ARE WAY BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THE NEXT ROOM TABLE. TWENTY SHOWS. THE IMPACT OF THE MITCHELL INCREASE AND THE NEW SIM INCREASE. THEN WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA TWO REGIONS. OF REGION ONE WOULD BE LIKE LOS ANGELES AMPS THIS GOAL. A SANTA CLARA DOES OF THE EIGHTEEN COUNTIES THE REST OF THE COMES ON REGION. IN REGION. ONE THIS. THREE THE THREE CATEGORIES OF FAMILIES THAT GO OVER THE 50%. TWO THREE FOUR FIFTY TO FIFTY ONE AND FIFTY FIFTY ONE THE REST OF MUST DO UNDER. THAT EVEN AFTER THE NEW SOME INCREASE. FOR THE SECOND REGION WHICH IS FRIENDS THOUGH SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. ONLY FAMILY OF TOOL MAKES THE ABOVE ABOUT 50% THE REST OF OUR BE LOWERED. OUR PROPOSAL BASICALLY IS WHICH IS TABLE. FOR IS TO LOOK AT ONE PARENT FAMILY IN A CHILD. AND GIVE THEM WHAT THE FEDERAL PUT 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL INPUT TWO PARENT FAMILIES. IN A CHILD WHAT THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WOULD BE. IT WOULD BE BASED ON THE CHILDREN AND THE PARENTS. THEN YOU MAY WONDER WHERE WOULD WE GET THE MONEY FROM. AND IF YOU LOOK AT TABLE. FIVE THIS IS THE ILLUSTRATION OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WITH THE CAL WORKS MONEY. FOR THE PAST. TWENTY YEAR IS ABOUT THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM. AND BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE GENERAL FUND. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHAT HAPPENED DOT COM IN THE GREAT RECESSION EVEN WHEN THE CASE LOAD WHEN UP. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM. THEY GIVE IT TO THE GENERAL FUND STAY THE SAME. SO THIS YEAR. THE BUT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS. THAT BUFFY FIVE BILLION. FIVE POINT ONE BILLION WOULD BE USEFUL CAL WORKS TWO POINT FIVE BILLION WOULD BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. LIKE -- WHICH IS RELIEF TO THE GENERAL FUND. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS AT LEAST A BILLION DOLLARS. THAT YOU COULD FIND IN AND TABLE. ONE THAT COULD BE USED -- TO TO PROMULGATE. TABLE. FOUR AND IF THERE IS MONEY LEFT OVER. IN THIS PROGRAM AND AND AND THE PROGRAM BETTER THAN GIVING UP THE GENERAL FUND THE SHIP IN THE RESERVE WHICH IS A SUBSEQUENT ISSUE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TYLER WOODS HAS NOTHING. FINANCE AND NOTHING IN COMMON NOT THIS TIME VERY GOOD -- LET'S ELIA. GOOD AFTERNOON JAZZ ALMA WITH ALLEGE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M. IN THINKING ABOUT THE DECISION BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR. IN OUR VIEW IT'S IT'S REALLY ABOUT RECONCILING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THE MULTI YEAR PLAN THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED LAST BUDGET -- FOR CAL WORKS GRANT INCREASES -- ULTIMATELY AND ARGUE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS A IS CLEARLY CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S SORT OF OVERALL PLAN FOR OUR SPRING CREASES IT IS A STEP IN THE IN THE SAME DIRECTION. BUT THERE ARE A FEW. KEY DIFFERENCES ARM FIRST AND FOREMOST -- THE LEGISLATURE'S pPLAN ULTIMATELY WOULD ALSO INCREASE GRANTS 250% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL BUT WOULD DO SO. FOR A FAMILY SIZED THAT IS ONE PERSON LARGER. THAN THE THE COLORS ASSISTANCE UNIT SIZE WE USE ASSISTANCE UNIT TO DESCRIBE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE. AND AND THIS IS A BY PRODUCT OF THE REALIZATION OR THE REALITY THAT. IN MORE THAN HALF OF CAL WORKS CASES THERE ISN'T AN ADULT IN THE FAMILY WHO IS INELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A SO IF YOU SET. GRANT SAT 50% OF THE FPL AND MORE THAN HALF OF CASES -- THE FAMILY ITSELF -- WOULD WOULD BE BELOW 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. I'M ANOTHER KEY DISTINCTION IS THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN IS A MULTI YEAR PLANS. ARE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A GRAND INCREASE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN AS ADOPTED LAST YEAR WOULD HAVE SORT OF A FINAL GRANT INCREASE -- TO TAKE PLACE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SOME. AND SO AND THINKING ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN OUR VIEW. WE RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WHAT WANT TO DO FIRST -- ONE OPTION IS TO CONTINUE THE ACROSS THE BOARD APPROACH AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BY INCREASING GRANTS BY THE SAME AMOUNT. ON ANOTHER OPTION IS TO TO TO FOLLOW SORT OF THE THE INITIAL STEP OF THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN WHICH WOULD INCREASE GRANTS BY VARYING AMOUNTS AND AND MR HERALD REFERENCE TO THIS. SPECIFICALLY THESE GRANT AMOUNTS FOR THE SMALLEST A FEW SIZES WOULD BE INCREASED BY A LARGER PERCENTAGE AMOUNT THAN THAT FOR OTHER GRANTS SOARED. TO BRING GRANT LEVELS FOR ALL A U. SIZES TO THE SAME -- PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL -- IN THINKING ABOUT. THIS OPTION WE POINTED OUT A COUPLE ALTERNATIVES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ONE OF WHICH WAS THE THE ALTERNATIVE THAT MR HERALD MENTIONED -- BUT WE WOULD NOTE THERE REALLY ARE MULTIPLE PASS FORWARD FOR THE SUB COMMITTEE AND FOR THE LEGISLATURE IT MAY NOT BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SPECIFICALLY POINTED OUT -- ONE OPTION IS TO SIMPLY CONTINUE ON THE PATH AS IT WAS OUTLINED. IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT BY REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND CONTINUE IN THAT DIRECTION. ALTERNATIVELY YOU COULD WORK WITH IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AMOUNTS BUT DISTRIBUTE RANTS DIFFERENTLY AS MR HERALD MENTIONED OR PURSUE SOMETHING -- SORT OF A COMBINATION WHERE -- ADDRESSING HOT SORT OF GRANT AMOUNTS FOR EACH A YOU SIZE IS NOT NECESSARILY 2408% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL BUT 250% WERE A BUS ON THE REALLY IS A GREAT DEAL OF FLEXIBILITY -- AT FOUR FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] MY MINISTRATION. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION -- CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THE REACTION IS TO THE 55% OF A USE THAT WERE ADULT. IS UNAIDED AND THE CON AND THE CONSTRUCT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HER WORDS I AT THIS TIME I THINK OUR REACTION IS THAT. IN THE CONTEXT OF A NATIVE ADULTS IN THE HOUSEHOLD THAT'S A CONSTRUCT OF ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND HI ANY DISCUSSIONS AROUND UNAIDED ADULTS -- SHOULD ALSO BE MARRIED WITH A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA ARE FOR THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND CURRENTLY WITH THE THIRTEEN POINT 1% GRANT INCREASE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THAT'S ADDRESSING A GRAND INCREASE FOR THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE. CAL WORKS CLIENTS IN THAT HOUSEHOLD. THE A YOU IN ONE WITH ONE CHILD REASONABLY AND ON A DID ADULTS HAS A FURTHER. HAS FOR THIS TO GO AND I THINK THAT WAS DISCUSSED -- EARLIER AND I THINK THAT -- MISTER HURLED TALKED ABOUT BRINGING EVERYBODY UP AS PROPOSED BY THE LA -- TO THE 48%. OF THE POVERTY LEVEL. EVEN WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS TO BRINGING OUR CHILDREN UP. TO THE 48% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL I KNOW THAT THAT THAT IS WHERE WE ARE NOW AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. HOW CAN WE FIX THIS? TO ASSURE THAT NO CHILD IS DISADVANTAGED IN THIS AREA IN THIS THIS EFFORT. AND TO BRING CHILDREN. TO BRING EVERY CHILD OUT OF DEEP POVERTY. WOULD ONE OF YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT. THAT HAS OUR AGAIN THANK YOU. I THINK THAT APPROACH WAS WHAT WAS EMBODIED AND DISCUSSED AS PART OF THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT INCLUDED IN TRAILER BILL THE MULTI YEAR APPROACH -- UNDER -- THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN TO INCREASE GRANTS 250% OF THE FPL AT A MINIMUM -- FOR ALL AGES SIZES. ACCOUNTING FOR A USE THAT MIGHT HAPPEN UNAIDED ADULT ON AND SO THAT WAS THE THE THE MOTIVATION AND THE AND THE THE AIM OF THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO GET US TO THE TO THE 50%. I JUST -- JUST AS WE MOVE FORWARD I I RECOGNIZE WERE TRYING TO WORK WITH FINITE NUMBERS. BUT THAT IS. OF OF SERIOUS CONCERN YES MISS REVIEW WOULD JUST HAVE A COMMENT AND I THERE'S A ON PAGE TWELVE THERE'S A CHART. THAT SAYS IN A AYE -- A YOU SIZE -- ONE IS THAT 43%. AND SO I THOUGHT THAT THE INTENT WAS TO BRING THEM UP. TO FORTY EIGHT OR AT LEAST 50% BY. THE A YOU ONE IS 43% ARE WE ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE. SO IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE THIRTEEN POINT 1% WAS CONSISTENT WITH AN ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASE AND THE ADMINISTRATION DID TARGET THAT INCREASED TOWARDS -- A MAJORITY OF THE CASES THAT FALL IN A YOU OF TWO AND THEN A YOU OF THREE NOT. SO WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE U. ONES IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THEY DID RECEIVE A THIRTEEN POINT 1% GRANT INCREASE RIGHT YOU'RE CORRECT THAT IT DOES NOT BRING IT UP 250% FOR RIGHT AND SOUL IS THERE AN INTENTION. TO FIX THAT BECAUSE 43% IS NOT. I EVEN IF YOU DO ANOTHER 13% OR WHATEVER IT IS ACROSS THE BOARD IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE TO BRING THAT EIGHTY ONE BACK UP TO FORTY EIGHT OR 50%. AND SO THERE IS IS THERE A PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT SPECIFICALLY. I'D I WOULD SAY AT THIS TIME. GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WAS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ALL OF HIS PRIORITIES WERE AND TO GIVE. US THE BOARD FOR YES OR NO. THERE'S NOTHING CURRENTLY PROPOSED STAND ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THAT OKAY SO IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE COULD DO OR WHAT CONVERSATION SHOULD WE BE HAVING WITH YOU OR THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIX THAT BECAUSE AGAIN IT SOUNDS GREAT. THAT WE'RE BRINGING YOU KNOW 13% ACROSS THE BOARD. WE DID GREAT THINGS WHICH IS GREAT FOR THE REST. I MEAN IT'S STILL NOT EVEN ENOUGH BY. ELLIE SAID SOMETHING BITES FOR THESE FOLKS IN PARTICULAR IT'S AND SOUL. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY IS STATE AIDS -- THESE ARE CHILDREN CLEARLY THAT. IF IT'S IN A YOU ONE THAT MEANS IT'S THE TILE THAT'S RECEIVING THE 42%. BECAUSE THE PARENT IS MOST LIKELY NOT. PART OF THE GRANT SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS. THAT A YOU ONE IS A CHILD. THAT WE SAID 43% IS GOOD ENOUGH. SO IN THE IN THE CONTEXT OF ONGOING DISCUSSIONS AS BUDGET DELIBERATIONS PLAY OUT AS MR HERALD AND MISTER ALMA NOTED THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE A GRANT INCREASE -- BUT IT'S ALL IN THE CONTACT IS ABOUT THE NEGATIVE OF OF LIMITED RESOURCES THE WAY I'D LIKE TO YOU KNOW I MEAN IF WE COULD DO TRADE YOU KNOW JUST WITH ALL DUE RESPECT IF WE COULD DO TRAILER BILLS. FOR YOUR NAME AND HOW MANY TRAILER BURIALS WE'VE DONE IT THIS IN PARTICULAR AGAIN AND JUST -- MY CONCERN AS I SHARE WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY IS AND I'M SURE THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE IS THE E. U. ONES WE KNOW SPECIFICALLY THAT THERE THE CHILDREN. I MEAN I I UNLESS THERE'S A DOUBT THAT THAT THE A YOU ONCE OUR CHILDREN. RIGHT AND SO WE'RE KIND OF DOING IT. NOT BACKWARDS BECAUSE I APPRECIATE BUT THIRTEEN POINT 1% BUT WE KNOW THAT THE THE A. YOU ONE IS A CHILD. AND SO. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE BALANCE THAT BECAUSE IT'S SPECIFICALLY FOR CHILDREN AND SO. I WOULD LIKE. THIS IS A TIME FOR THE DISCUSSION I GUESS WE CAN PUSH IT ON TO YOU KNOW LET'S TALK IN MY OFFICE OR LET'S WORK ON THIS LEADER. THIS IS WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING SO THAT WE COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. ON YOUR END AND ON OUR END AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE THAT 13% THAT'S GREAT BY. AS A MOM IS A FORMER TEACHER I CAN TELL YOU THAT THESE ARE CHILDREN. THE 42% AS A CHILD AND SO HOW DO WE RECONCILE. DIED WERE AT 42% FOR A CHILD KNOWING THAT THERE'S TWO PEOPLE IN THE HOUSEHOLD. AND HOW DO WE RECONCILE THAT WITH WITH YOU KNOW OUR GOAL IS -- TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN AND TO BRING CHILDREN OUT OF THE POVERTY I MEAN I HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME WHICH IS A GREAT AND NOBLE. COMMENT BY THE CHART SHOWS OTHERWISE. SO I NEED YOUR HELP CAN WE HAVE THAT DISCUSSION HERE. CERTAINLY OKAY. AND I THINK WHAT SHOULD BE NOTED AS MS JOHNSON SAID IS WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A U.. S.. ONE THAT'S 26% OF ALL CHILDREN. WAS THAT CORRECT. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT FALL UNDER THIS CATEGORY. WHO REMAINED IN DEEP POVERTY -- I KNOW THE LA -- HAS IN THE PROPOSAL TALKED ABOUT INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE AND USING SOME OF CASH AND FINDING OTHER WAYS AND PERHAPS. THAT IS -- PART OF WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO TO DO MR HELL DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT YOU'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVIEW THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR REFERENCING THE CHART ON PAGE TWELVE I THINK. THE NUMBER THAT YOU'RE IDENTIFIED I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THIS WHAT THIS REALLY IS A REFLECTION OF IS A HISTORICAL INEQUITY THAT HAVE BEEN BEEN BUILT IN THE GRANT LEVELS FOR DECADES. THAT WAS A CHOICE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE AND APPROVED PRIOR LEGISLATURE PRIOR GOVERNOR AND IT'S A CHOICE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE IN THIS GOVERNOR CAN CHOOSE TO FIX. AND SO I THAT'S WHY WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT WE DO ADOPT LANGUAGE WITHIN THIS BUDGET THAT WOULD ALLOCATE THE AMOUNT THE GOVERNOR PROVIDES OR IF WE CAN GET AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT. THAT WOULD GO TO MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IS AT THE SAME LEVEL OF THE POVERTY LEVEL AND WE DON'T CONTINUE THIS HISTORICAL INEQUITY THAT WE SEE FOR THESE SINGLE TRIAL HOUSEHOLDS. THANK YOU AND THE POINT THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS IS EXACTLY THAT. THAT WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE DON'T PAT OURSELVES ON THE BACK -- AGAIN IT'S REALLY APPRECIATED THAT WE HAVE 13% BUT IT REALLY ISN'T YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND IN THAT TIME WHEN WERE BOASTING ABOUT THE THE THE AXIS AND REVENUES. IF YOU ARE THE OVER BUDGET OR WHATEVER BOTH THE WORD WE CHOOSE TO USE. JUST. I CAN TALK IN PERCENTAGES BUT IT WILL HIT HOME BETTER THAN. THEY RECEIVE SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A YEAR. I I MEAN SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT'S I I DON'T KNOW WHO CAN LIVE OFF OF THAT. AND SO THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT YES WE CAN CHOOSE TO FIX IT BY BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY SAID HOW GREAT WE ARE BECAUSE WE'VE INCREASE THAT THIRTEEN POINT 1% I DON'T WANT THIS. YOU KNOW IF WE DECIDE AT SOME POINT TO PUT THIS IN SOME KIND OF A EITHER TRAILER BILL OR FOR US TO DECIDE THAT THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE FOR US NOT TO SAY WHAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE THIRTEEN POINT 1%. LET US JUST CONTINUE INTO THIS NEXT YEAR AND SO I NEED YOUR HELP. TO FIGURE OUT HOW WHAT LANGUAGE OR WHAT IN WHAT CONTEXT WE PUT THIS IN SO THAT. WE THESE PEOPLE DOT ORG THESE CHILDREN. DON'T RECEIVE ONLY SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A YEAR. I MEAN THAT'S YOU KNOW FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT -- DRINK STARBUCKS IT'S YOU KNOW TWO HUNDRED IF YOU DRINK STARBUCKS EVERY DAY IT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. THAT YOU SPEND ON STARBUCKS AND YOU KNOW JUST. I DON'T WANT -- TO KEEP THE LABORING THE POINT BY IF WE DECIDE TO FIX THIS. SAYING THAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE THIRTEEN PORTS PERCENT ACROSS THE BOARD I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE A REASON NOT TO HELP US FIGURE HOW WE CAN INCREASE THIS. TO THE 50% OR THE 40% LEVEL. THANK YOU. AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERFECTLY WILLING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RECOGNIZING THAT AS A PRIORITY. THANK YOU MS REVIEW THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS [inaudible] VERY GOOD. LET'S MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO SOME TATIAN. UPDATE ON CAL WORKS OUT COMES IN ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW THE SINGLE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON SAFETY NET RESERVE FUND INCLUDING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WITH ASSOCIATED ADVOCACY PROPOSALS. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND AND STAFF APOLOGIES FOR THE EARLIER FALL START -- THAT'S ALL RIGHT WE'RE ON TRACK NOW. YES MY NAME'S A TOPIC ON THE NEW CAL WORKS IN CHILD CARE BRANCH CHIEF IT CDSS I'D FIRST LIKE TO NOTE IN THANK YOU FOR THE CONFERENCE OVERVIEW OF CAL OR IN THE AGENDA ON PAGES TWENTY ONE THREE TWENTY THREE TO THAT I JUST WANTED TO ADD A BIT. OF ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY FIRST HIGHLIGHTING THAT COW OR IS A NEW AND DISTINCT MOVE AWAY FROM HOME AN OLD WORK FIRST MENTALITY IN AN HISTORIC EMPHASIS ON W. P. R. WHICH IS THE SINGULAR FEDERAL. MEASURE WHICH IS A POOR PROXY IT BEST IN A PERVERSE INCENTIVE AT WORST -- THE PREVIOUSLY DROVE DECISION MAKING FOR CAL WORKS PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. CAL OR REPRESENTS A CRITICAL PATH FORWARD FOR THE STATE TO STAND BY A MESSAGE OF ENGAGEMENT. pAND INTENTIONALITY IN SERVICE PROVISION. HUNDREDS OF STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE STATE'S COUNTY PARTNER AGENCIES ADVOCATES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN WORK FOR OVER EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN MORE THAN FIFTY MEETINGS TO CRAFT A FRAMEWORK FOR THE CAL OR CULTURE SHIFT. REPRESENTING A MOVE TOWARDS CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN A REAL MODEL MODEL FOR DATA DRIVEN PROGRAM MANAGEMENT. THE STATE AND STAKEHOLDERS HAVE WORKED VERY HARD TO DEFINE AND DEVISE THE THREE COMPONENT PARTS OF CAL OR AND WE'RE PLEASED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT. THEIR NEARLY FINALIZED IN PREPARATION FOR LAUNCH JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN WITH AN ON RAMP TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION BY THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY PART ONE OF CAL OR IS A SET OF TWENTY SEVEN PROCESS SHORT TERM MEDIUM TERM LONG TERM METRICS THAT REFLECT THE COW WORKS PROGRAM LOGIC MODEL. PART TWO IS A COUNTY SELF ASSESSMENT WHICH PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COUNTIES TO REALLY DIG INTO THE METRICS AND REFLECT ON AND GATHER LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS FOR CONVERSATION WHILE INCORPORATING ADDITIONAL KLEIN FEEDBACK THROUGH A NEW CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY. ALLOWING LOCAL NUANCE PROGRAM DESIGN AND INNOVATION TO DRIVE THE SPIRIT OF CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT. PART THREE IS A SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT PLAN TO CAPTURE COUNTY GOALS FOR INNOVATION TWEAKS AND STRATEGIES TO BETTER SERVE THE CALL WORKS RECIPIENTS. COUNTIES WILL CONNECT WITH OTHER COUNTIES REPEAL YOUR SUPPORT AND REVIEW -- OF SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT PLANS IN THE STABLE PARTNER WITH THE COUNTY THROUGHOUT ALL THREE STEPS IN THIS PROCESS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. COLOR SET TO LAUNCH AS I NOTED JULY TWENTY NINETEEN WITH THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA DASHBOARD. INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THOSE DASHBOARDS WILL BE UPDATED WITH NEW METRICSIN PHASES AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE AND THEN ON A REGULAR ROLLING BASIS MONTHLY IN. WE'RE WORKING WITH YOU TO BE A IN THE CONSORTIA AND OUTSIDE PARTNERS TO TACKLE DATA LIMITATIONS AND TO GENERALLY CREATE A WHOLE NEW DATA DRIVEN PROCESS FROM THE GROUND UP. THE FIRST COUNTY CSA'S WILL BE DRAFTED BY SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THE FIRST SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT PLANS WILL BE DRAFTED -- BY THE WINTER OF TWENTY TWENTY IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOLLOWING THAT OVERVIEW I'M HAPPY TO MOVE ON TO RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO WITH REGARDS TO CAL WORKS TWO POINT NO AND LIKE TO KNOW THE CALORIES TWO POINT OH IS AN INITIATIVE LED BY THE COUNTIES. THEY'RE CONTINUING TO IMPLEMENT AND THIS APPROACH STATEWIDE IN THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES IT'S TOO EARLY TO DEFINITIVELY CODIFIED THE APPROACH IN STATUTE BUT IS VERY INTERESTED IN CONTINUING TO LEARN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF CASE TYPES WITH APPROPRIATE FUNDING. FOLLOWING CASE MANAGEMENT THE DEPARTMENT STAKEHOLDER STAKEHOLDERS WILL REVIEW THE SERVICES PORTION OF THE METHODOLOGY TO DETERMINE WHAT ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS MIGHT BE NEEDED. AND I'D LIKE TO HAND OVER TO MY PARTNERS OF FINANCE STIR WHAT'S SURE -- FOR THE SAFETY NET RESERVE QUESTION THAT'S IN YOUR AGENDA I THINK MR SO JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE TO THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- ARE NOT. REDIRECTING THE INTENT OF PUTTING OUT FUNDING TOWARDS MEDI CAL AND HOWARD SPECIFICALLY. HI THIS IS SIMPLY AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE CALLING THE SAN OF THAT. THE CAL WORKS IN MEDICAL PROGRAMS CAN CHANGE OVER TIME -- THE CASELOADS THE VARYING LEVELS SERVICES. AND PUTTING IN PLACE A METHODOLOGY -- FOR FUNDING IN AND OUT OF THAT RESERVE FIND. MIGHT BE. TYING OUR HANDS TO SOME EXTENT AT LEAST FOR WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION HAVING FLEXIBILITY DURING A DOWNTURN TO USE THOSE FUNDS. AND AGAIN JUST SO I REITERATE THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE STILL INTENDED TO GO TO THE TWO PROGRAMS AS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN SOME FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER. IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE POINTED OUT PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHANGE IN THE WAY WE DO ELFARE TO WORK. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE COWARDS PROGRAM. WE DIDN'T HAVE A PROGRAM THAT CLEARLY ARTICULATED WOULD WE WANTED OUT OF IT HOW WE ARE WHAT WE REALLY MEASURED WAS A FEDERAL WORK PARTICIPATION RATE THAT WE ALL KNEW WAS FLAWED. I'M AND WE DIDN'T. TRACK THOSE OUTCOMES AND TRANSPARENTLY PUBLISH THEM AND ASK COUNTIES TO USE THOSE THE DATA ON THOSE OUTCOMES. FOR CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN THOSE ARE REALLY THE KEY ELEMENTS. AS MY COLLEAGUE DISCUSSED -- AND SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS WE'RE VERY PLEASED AT THE PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH ADD ADVOCATES IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK -- MY COLLEAGUES I TALKED ABOUT THE MILESTONES THAT WERE REACHING I CAN TELL YOU -- THIS IS AN EXTREMELY HEAVY LEFT AND WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE THE TOUGH PART WHICH IS OPERATIONALIZE SAYING. SO COLLECTING DATA -- FROM DATA SYSTEMS THAT WERE NOT BUILT FOR OUTCOMES MONITORING. I'M LINKING TO OTHER DATA SOURCES LIKE EDT THAT HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE NO LONGER ON A ROLES -- AND SO THE AMOUNT OF CREATIVITY AND THOUGHT GOING INTO EXACTLY HOW TO DO THIS -- HAS BEEN -- REFRESHING AND AND SOMETHING THAT WERE THAT WERE QUITE PLEASED ABOUT FROM A BUDGETING STANDPOINT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. ON THE BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR DATA COLLECTION AND THE COUNTY CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT WORK AND WE HOPE TO HAVE SOMETHING IN THE MAY REVISION THAT MEETS EVERYONE'S. EXPECTATIONS [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND MADAME TRY DON'T KNOW IF IT'S NOW IF IF YOU'D LIKE A BRIEF COMMENT ON THE SINGLE ALLOCATION. THAT WOULD BE GOOD. THANK YOU -- MIKE MY COLLEAGUES ALSO DISCUSSED THE EFFORT UNDER WAY THAT WAS STATUTORILY REQUIRED. FOR THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE TO DEVELOP A NEW BUDGETING METHODOLOGY FOR THE EMPLOYMENT SEARCH SERVICES METHODOLOGY. TO YOUR QUESTION IN THE AGENDA IT HAS BEEN ILLUMINATED BY THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN CAL WORKS TWO POINT NOW. SO THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT GO INTO CASE WORK THE TYPE OF INTENSITY OF THE CONTACT THAT WE WANT EMPLOYMENT SERVICES WORKERS TO HAVE WITH FAMILIES. HAS BEEN ILLUMINATED BY THE WORK WE'VE DONE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. ON HOW. TO USE THE BEST STATE OF INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE MOVE ON THEIR JOURNEY. FROM FROM WELFARE TO WORK WE THE STATE IN THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN REMARKABLY ALIGNED AND SORT OF THE WAY WE'RE THINKING ABOUT -- A NEW METHODOLOGY SHOULD BE CONSTRUCTED AND WE WE ARE AT THE POINT WHERE SORT OF THE DEVIL. IS IN THE DETAILS -- AND WILL KNOW WITH THOSE DETAILS ARE MORE I ASSUME IN THE MAY REVISION COMES OUT -- BUT WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL HAVE THE SORT OF THE THE GUTS OF FOR THE OR THE LION'S SHARE OF A METHODOLOGY. THAT FUNDS COUNTIES FOR THE OUTCOMES THAT YOU WANT OUT OF THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NOW. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. I'M SURE THERE WILL BE SOME QUESTIONS LATER BUT IF WE CAN HAVE MISTER HERALD. BACKUP. IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE DON'T HAVE MORE CHAIRS. THE SMALL ROOM. THE SMALL ROOM -- MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- SO I I THINK YOU JUST HEARD A VERY GOOD OVERVIEW I THINK FROM THE STATE AND FROM THE COUNTIES ABOUT. THE THREE MAINISSUE AREAS THAT -- ALL OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING ON AT THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES MANY MANY MANY MANY MEETINGS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS REALLY GOING BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF CALOR -- AND I HAVE SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I WANT TO GET TO A FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHICH I ARE OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA BUT THE BROADER PICTURE I WANT. A TO FIRST START OFF WITH IS THAT ALL THREE OF THESE ISSUES ARE INTER RELATED. AM I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE TO VIEW THESE ISSUES THAT WAY -- AND I WOULD ALSO AGREE WITH THE ASSESSMENT OF BOTH MS NIKOLAI MISTER MECCA THAT THESE ARE TRANSFORMATIONAL EFFORTS THAT WERE DOING. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL CULTURE SHIFT THAT THE STATE IS ENGAGING IN RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE MANAGE. THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM -- AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW -- WE WON'T KNOW THE OUTCOMES FOR THAT FOR A FEW YEARS BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE REAL DATA. FOR YOU FOR THE PUBLIC FOR OURSELVES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THESE KIND OF ASSESSMENTS ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE COMING FROM THE STATE BUDGET EVERY YEAR -- SO -- I I I WOULD JUST BUT LET ME JUST TRY IT THIS WAY BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO THINK ABOUT A WE WAITED WE THIS ALL TOGETHER AND I'M GOING TO PROBABLY FUNDAMENTALLY CRASH AND BURN HERE. BUT SO IT IN OUR WAY OF THINKING -- BOTH CAN OF TWO POINT NO CAL WORKS TO POINT KNOWS IT'S BEING CALLED AND CAL OR OR SORT OF ON COMPLEMENTARY PIECES -- WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO INSTITUTE A TWO GENERATIONAL APPROACH TO ENDING POVERTY AMONG EXTREMELY POOR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE USING CALOR PRINCIPALLY AS WELL AS A WAY TO MEASURE AND TRACK THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE DOING IN THAT ENDEAVOR -- SO IT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL THAT WE DO THAT BUT THE SINGLE ALLOCATION FUND IN OUR JUDGMENT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL MAKE THIS YEAR. BECAUSE REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS MISTER MAC A REFERENCE HISTORICALLY -- CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES WITHIN THE SINGLE ALLOCATION SERVICES FUND HAVE BEEN A FLAT AMOUNT SO FOR EVERY CASE THAT THE COUNTY GETS. NO MATTER WHAT THE NEEDS OF THAT FAMILY THEY GET THE SAME AMOUNT. AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT NOW IS AN APPROACH THAT WOULD REALLY. HAVE US PRIORITIZE AND PUT MONEY TO WHERE WE WANT COUNTIES TO FOCUS. SO FAMILIES IN OUR JUDGMENT WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS FAMILIES WHO ARE HOMELESS FAMILIES WHO HAVE FAILED TO KEEP CHILDREN WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES OR OTHER CHALLENGES -- FAMILIES WHO ARE FACING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OF THESE ARE FAMILIES THAT ARE IN TRAUMA AND CRISIS WHEN THEY COME IN THE OFFICE OFTEN AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT COUNTIES ARE INCENTIVIZE FINANCIALLY TO REALLY ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS RIGHT UP FRONT. I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK WHEN WE SEE THE MAY BE REVISED PROPOSALS ABOUT WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE ADDITION TO THAT THAT WE WANT. TO WE WANT TO FOCUS ON AND FOR US AS WE DISCUSS IN MANY FORMS WE REALLY BELIEVE IN EDUCATION WE REALLY WANT TO SEE FAMILIES ENCOURAGED TO GO TO EDUCATION. SO WE WOULDN'T AND ENCOURAGING AGAIN A CASE MANAGEMENT FEE THAT WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE COUNTIES TO GO TOWARDS EDUCATION -- STE SO AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM INTO THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WE MIGHT NOT WANT TO ENCOURAGE WITH A LARGE CASE MANAGEMENT FEE. THE CONVICTED THERE THE OLD APPROACH THAT WE'VE HAD OF WORK FIRST WHICH IS SIMPLY GO THROUGH THE THE JOB CLUB TRY TO GET A JOB RIGHT AWAY -- AND HOPEFULLY WORK YOURSELF UP PARTY WE THINK THAT THAT MODEL HAS RUN ITS COURSE SO THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO SEE THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL RANGE THERE OF OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE SINGLE ALLOCATION IN MANY WAYS IS GOING TO DRIVE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE WILL GET THROUGH CALOR AND THE SUCCESS THAT WE CAN GET FROM PAN OF TWO POINT NO. SO I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THAT APART I MEAN THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT A HEAVY FOCUS ON THAT WHEN WE COME TO MAY REVISE -- ONE OR TWO ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT I WOULD JUST SAY -- ON TEN OF TWO POINT NO -- WELL I THINK THE DILEMMA THAT WE FACE RIGHT NOW IS -- IS THAT THE THE STATUTE CONTINUES TO READ AS A WORK FIRST MODEL IT'S A VERY RIGID APPROACH. I'M I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE SHOULD MAKE SOME. CHANGES TO THE STATUTES WITHIN THIS EXISTING BUDGET I THINK THAT WOULD TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF FOUGHT AN EXAMINATION FOR US TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF CHANGES. BUT I DO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO BE SENDING A SIGNAL. THAT WE ARE CHANGING. AND SO WE COULD DO THAT I THINK THROUGH SOME INTENT LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT AND I THINK THEN WE COULD FOLLOW THAT UP BY HAVING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CREATE A STAKEHOLDER WORK PROCESS. TO LOOK AT HOW COULD WE AND SHOULD WE CHANGE THE STATUTE IN THE FUTURE AND TO BRING THAT BACK FOR CONSIDERATION BY THIS COMMITTEE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET CYCLE. I I DO THINK -- ON ALL THIS IS COMPLICATED WE NEED TO ALL GET IN A ROOM AND REALLY PUT OUR THINKING CAPS ON AND TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT. SO THAT WOULD BE OUR THAT WOULD BE OUR PROPOSAL ON HOW TO TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE ON THE TOWN OF TWO POINT OO SCOURS TWO POINT OH EXCUSE ME FOR SAYING THAT AGAIN. I'M AND THEN UNDER THE DISORDER QUEST THAT WE WOULD HAVE AROUND THE SINGLE ALLOCATION IS THAT -- WHY WE THINK THAT IT'S GREAT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SEE -- INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO HELP THE FAMILIES OF THE GREATEST NEEDS AND WE'RE PUTTING MONEY INTO WHERE WE THINK THE PRIORITIES OF THE COUNTIES FOCUS SHOULD BE. ON WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE RECIPIENTS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING THE SERVICES THAT ARE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDED. AND SO ONE THING THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IS IN THE PROCESS AND THE CONCEPT OF THE SINGLE ALLOCATION IS. HOW DO WE FLIP THE SWITCH IF YOU CAN ON SERVICES SO ONCE THE COUNTY AUTHORIZES AND SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL? AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND YOU'RE GONNA TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS OF CLASS AND AT THE MOMENT THAT THAT HAPPENS THE COUNTY AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZES THE THE AN ALLOCATION FOR BOOKS THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO THAT STUDENT. SO THE STUDENT THE CURRENT WAY THINGS WORK THE STUDENT HAS TO COME BACK TO THE WORKER PRESENT WITH THEIR BOOKS ARE AND THEN THE THE WORKABLE MAKE THAT STUDENT JUSTIFY THAT THE STUDENT PARENT JUSTIFY THAT. WE FREQUENTLY SEE IF -- PARENTS WERE SITTING IN THEIR SECOND THIRD FOURTH WEEK OF CLASS AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE THEIR BOOKS. WE HAVE TO IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS I THINK CHILD CARE IS ANOTHER ARENA WHERE WE ALSO NEED TO BE FLIPPING THE SWITCH THAT ONCE WE AUTHORIZE A WELFARE TO WORK PLAN. CHILD CARE JUST OUGHT TO GO WITH IT THE THE WORKER. SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO BACK AND SPEND MORE TIME GOING THROUGH PAPERWORK RE AUTHORIZING SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY IN TOP AN ENTITLEMENT IN THE LAW. SO THESE ARE THE KIND OF CHANGES THAT WE WE THINK ARE NECESSARY THAT WOULD BOTH STREAMLINED THE PROGRAM TAKE SOME OF THE COMPLEXITY OUT OF MAKE IT EASIER. FOR THE RECIPIENTS TO GET THROUGH THIS AND ALLOW THE WORKERS TO BE SOCIAL WORKERS AND NOT BE PAPER PUSHERS -- AND THEN -- ON THE SAFETY NET. FIRST OF ALL WE SUPPORT OBVIOUSLY THE AUGMENTATION THAT'S BEING PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION THE SAFETY NET RESERVE I'M SPEAKING OF NOW. WE APPRECIATE THE THE THE GOVERNOR'S ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THAT. WE WORRY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HAVING ALL THE MONEY AND WANT. TO COUNT -- OR YOU KNOW -- CAL WORKS IS FREQUENTLY TAKEN VERY DEEP CUTS IN PRIOR BUDGETS -- AND I WOULD JUST BE. LESS THAN HONEST I DIDN'T SAY THAT YOU KNOW THEM. THE HEALTHCARE ARENA HAS A LOT OF POWERFUL INTEREST GROUPS AND AT HAS A LOT OF STRONG ADVOCATES -- THERE AREN'T AS MANY IN THE WALL FOR WORLD I THINK PUTTING SOME WALLS AROUND THAT FUNDING TO PROTECT THAT AND MAKE SURE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE SUBSTANTIAL FOR OUR TO REHAB GOD FOR BID ANOTHER BAD BUDGET IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- AND THEN WE REALLY DO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTER THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS PUT IN LAST YEAR'S TRAILER BILL THAT WOULD TRY TO MOVE -- AS WE SEE CASELOAD DECLINES AS OUTLINED AS BY MS JOHNSON EARLIER AS WE SEE THOSE CASELOAD DECLINES THAT WE WOULD TAKE SOME OF THAT REVENUE AND PUT IT INTO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE. AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT OVER THE LAST SAY HALF DOZEN YEARS WE REALLY HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL RESERVE BECAUSE OUR CASELOADS DROPPED A LOT FRANKLY WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING THE SAME THING IN OUR SOCIETY -- SO UNFORTUNATE WE CAN'T SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATION ON THAT PIECE -- BUT WE DO AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUGMENTATION THANK YOU. YOU DON'T SUPPORT YOU SUPPORT THE SEVEN HUNDRED BILL YES NOT OKAY YES BUT NOT THE POST SO WE'RE CLEAR NOT THE POLICY CHANGE IS WONDERFUL -- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. TOWARDS HER TO FINANCE NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME HELLO [inaudible] ALL. SPEAKING EXCLUSIVELY TO THE THE SAFETY NET RESERVE QUESTION -- SO JUST TO GO BACK A BIT IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AN INITIAL DEPOSIT OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS MADE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. A US A SECOND DEPOSIT OF SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION FOR TOTAL NINE HUNDRED MILLION. ON IN DOING SO THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSES SOME STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO HOW THE RESERVE WOULD WORK OUR OFFICE MADE NO SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS TO APPROVE OR NOT THOSE STRUCTURAL CHANGES -- RIGHT NOW THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO BE USED FOR EITHER CAL WORKS FOR MEDI CAL IS MR HERALD MENTIONED -- PREVIOUSLY UNDER THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET STRUCTURE THERE ARE TWO SUB ACCOUNTS SO THEY WERE THEY WERE SEPARATED -- WE POINT OUT WE'RE NOT. CERTAIN HOW MUCH SEPARATION IN PRACTICE THAT PROVIDED IT WAS CLEARLY A SIGNAL BUT THEY WERE STATUTORY SOME ACCOUNTS SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE AT ANY POINT IN THE FUTURE. JANE STATUTE AND MOVED FUNDS BETWEEN THOSE TWO SUB ACCOUNTS IF SOMETHING AS AS MISTER WOODS MENTIONED -- CHANGED REGARDING ONE OF THE PROGRAMS AND THE FLEXIBILITY WAS NEEDED -- SO WE THINK THAT'S A QUESTION REALLY FOR THE LEGISLATURE GOING FORWARD OUT REGARDING THE WHETHER OR NOT TO USE A FORMULA DRIVEN DEPOSIT SORT OF AN AUTOMATIC THE POSITIVE CASELOAD SAVINGS EACH YEAR. ON WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THE FORMULA DRIVEN APPROACH THAT WAS A PART OF THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGETARY STRUCTURE FOR THE RESERVE. MIGHT. RESULT IN A SORT OF RECOMMENDED AUTOMATIC DEPOSIT THAT WASN'T IN THE LEGISLATURE'S BEST INTEREST IN SOME FUTURE YEAR -- AND SO WE DO APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY OF NOT HAVING AN AUTOMATIC DEPOSIT -- BUT WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE. REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EACH YEAR TO BASICALLY PUBLISHED THAT CASE LOAD SAVINGS NUMBER AND MAKE IT PART OF THE BUDGET CONVERSATIONS SO BETWEEN EARLY SPRING AND AND THE THE SIGNING OF THE BUDGET AX THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR CONSERVE. NEGOTIATE AROUND THAT CASELOAD SAVINGS NUMBER AND DETERMINE HOW MUCH GIVEN THE LETTERS LEADERS PRIORITIES SHOULD BE SET ASIDE IN THE RESERVE FOR FUTURE YEARS OR USE FOR OTHER PURPOSES -- SO WE WE THINK OF THAT AS A SORT OF A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN THE TWO APPROACHES THAT THAT WE WOULD. AT LEAST SUGGEST IF NOT RECOMMEND. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM. FROM THE COMMITTEE. I DO WANT TO COMMENT THAT I THINK THAT THIS. ENTIRE NEW APPROACH IS JUST WONDERFUL WERE WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEING SOCIAL WORKERS. BECAUSE IF THE ENTIRE INTENT IS TO GET OUR CHILDREN IN THE FAMILIES OUT OF DEEP POVERTY NOT OF POVERTY. THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE WE TO GET JOBS WE TO GET TRAINING -- AND YOU'RE RIGHT IF THE IF THE IF THE THE PARENTS HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GO TO SCHOOL. IT SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC WE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE. TO FIGURE OUT TO ANOTHER PAPER THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IT SHOULD BE A PROCESS SO THAT IT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED OTHERWISE. OKAY WE'VE GOT IN SCHOOL THAT ME MEANT NOTHING BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEIR BOOKS. THAT BECOMES A SERIOUS PROBLEM -- I IN ONE OF THE COMMENTS. ON THE SINGLE ALLOCATION I KNOW THAT THE THE ADVOCATES. WHAT TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS SO I WOULD ASK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THERE AS? THAT PARTICULAR -- PART OF IT IS IS IS YEAR YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THAT CAN CAN WE INCLUDE THE AT THIS THE ADVOCATES. IN THAT DISCUSSION. FINANCE WOODS A BUT WE'VE CURRENTLY WERE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY PARTNERS BUT IF THERE IS. TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST MADAM CHAIR I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK THE STATUTE TO MAKE SURE THAT IS APPROPRIATE. BUT IF THAT IS INDEED THE CASE WE COULD HAVE A DISCUSSION EVERYONE JUST PULL SO LET'S ASSUME IT IS APPROPRIATE. THEN WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN INCLUDE THE STAKEHOLDERS. I'M NOT TRYING TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT I JUST THINK THAT IF IT'S SOMETHING. IN THE END WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET TO THE SAME PLACE. WE WANT TO WE DON'T WE WANT TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD. AND IF WE HAVE STAKEHOLDERS. WHO ARE SO CONCERNED AND WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS? THEN WHEN WHEN IT THE PROPOSAL IS BROUGHT TO THE COMMITTEE THEN THE DISCUSSION IS ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS GOT TOGETHER WE DISCUSS THIS. THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE DON'T JUST WE DON'T AGREE ON BUT THIS WAS DISCUSSION THIS IS THE END RESULT -- AS OPPOSED TO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING STAKEHOLDERS WELL WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW WE WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT WE THINK ABOUT. YES IT'S JON CAM JOHNSON SOCIAL SERVICES SO I I'LL JUST ADD THAT YES THERE IS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO CONSULT WITH STAKEHOLDERS KNOWS THEY'RE ACTUALLY IT'S ACTUALLY SPECIFIC THE COMPOSITION IS INCLUDED IN STATUTE WE HAVE. SO -- THERE'S BEEN TWO LARGER STAKEHOLDER AT MEETING SPECIFIC TO THE SINGLE ALLOCATION EMPLOYMENT SERVICES COMPONENT THE FIRST WAS IN ARE. AT KIND OF KICK OFF OF THINKING THROUGH THE CONCEPTS WE WANTED TO EXPLORE IN THINKING THROUGH WHAT KIND OF PHASES OR STAGES WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT ARE THE COMPONENTS WITHIN THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES. AND WE ALSO JUST HELD A STAKEHOLDER MEETING A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO SPECIFIC TO THINKING ABOUT CASE MANAGEMENT AND DIFFERENT NEEDS OF DIFFERENT POPULATIONS WITH AND CAL WORKS. WONDERFUL IT AND I KNOW THAT IF GOING BACK TO THE SAME THING OF CALOR. WE'RE MORE IS WANTED. TO RIDE LEAVING MR HERALD IT IS TALKED ABOUT THAT WE WANT INTERVENTION WE WANT TO BE AREA REMOVAL WE WANT HOUSING JUST AS AS YOU MENTIONED -- IF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS AN ISSUE THAT'S DEAL WITH THAT. THEY NEED A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA LET'S DEAL WITH THAT COLLEGE COGNITIVE ISSUES MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHATEVER THE ISSUES ARE THEN YOU WORK AS A SOCIAL WORKER. TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE FAMILY BECAUSE WE WANT AGAIN TO TAKE THESE CHILDREN IN THESE FAMILIES. OUT OF THE DEEP POVERTY. COLLEAGUES YOU STOP ME WHENEVER YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING BECAUSE I I THINK IT WOULDN'T. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE THE SAFETY NET -- I AT FIRST I I I AM EVER SO GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR -- FOR THE ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION. I I THINK THAT THAT IS. IT SENDS A MESSAGE IT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUDGET IT IS OUR VALUES AND I I I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT AND KNOW MY COLLEAGUES DO AS WELL. I THINK THAT THE NEED FOR THE SUB ACCOUNTS. I WANT TO STATE I THINK WE HAVE THE NEED FOR THE SUB ACCOUNTS. I THINK THAT -- I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED AND I THINK MR HERALD YOU MENTIONED THAT. THAT WE DO NEED TO PROTECT THE PROGRAMS BECAUSE WHEN WERE STARTING TO LOOK FOR CUTS FOR AREAS TO CUT. OFTENTIMES SOLDIER THE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CUT DO WE WANT TO BE SURE. THAT WE DO PROTECT THEM BECAUSE THESE ARE TOTALLY RIGHTEOUS PROGRAMS AND WE'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS TO TO PROTECT THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT DO HELP. OUR KIDS -- AND WE'VE GOT TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO TO PROTECT THEM -- INDEED GOING BACK TO THE SINGLE ALLOCATION ARE THERE ANY. ADDITIONAL PENDING MEETINGS -- WITH THE WITH THE ADVOCATES FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS -- I THINK ONCE WE SO WE HAVE WE'RE NOT AT THE FINAL PLACE WE'RE STILL EXPLORING AT WHAT. THE CASE MANAGEMENT COMPONENT OF THE METHODOLOGY MIGHT BE AS WE TURN TO SERVICES WHICH YOU HEARD AT MR HERALD HERALD MENTIONED AND AND AT THINKING THROUGH WHAT IS THE AT METHODOLOGY BEHIND HOW WE IDENTIFY THE SERVICE NEEDS REALLY BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS -- I THINK WHAT WE WILL ABSOLUTELY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS FOR THAT CONVERSATION WONDERFUL. WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YES MISTER FRAZIER. AND AGAIN I I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S WILLINGNESS TO ADVANCE -- THE SAFETY NET. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL ALSO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE INSTALLED ON ANY OF THESE -- PANELS. THAT YOU SHOW EXPECTATIONS AND COMES. AS SO THATWE CAN SHOW ADVANCES. SO THAT WE CAN JUSTIFY ADDITIONAL DOLLARS GOING FORWARD -- WE DON'T WANT WHEN WE HAVE -- BLACK OR WHITE OR ANY KIND OF WHITE PAPER PERSPECTIVE GOING FORWARD -- IT'S HARD TO ARGUE. YOU KNOW REALLY GOOD OUTCOMES OKAY. AND THEN THE MONEY'S BEEN SPEND IT AT A GOOD VALUE. THEN THE DEAL OF CAN'T REFUTE THAT. I'M SERIOUS I MEAN AND THE VACANCY THEY CAN BE PROUD OF WHAT THEY'VE ALSO SUPPORTED GOING. FOR SO. I THINK YOU KNOW MY EXPECTATION IS IS A I SEE. YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS GOING OUT. AND I'M A WILL HAVE AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE USED WELL [inaudible] HOW WELL? SO IF WE CAN START TRACKING. AND AND BEING ACCOUNTABLE. FOR WHAT WE'RE GETTING AS AN OUTCOME. THAT TO ME. IS WHAT THE BUDGET SUB. ONE PANEL IS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AND AND AND IT ACCOMPLISHING. AND IN THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS. WE'VE ADVANCED. GREAT. SOCIAL EQUITY. WE ALSO DID IT. IT'LL WE HAD A DANCE PEOPLE INTO ANOTHER -- OUT OF POVERTY AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- RUBIO SAID. AND THE DOLLAR WAS SPENT. HAS THIS PANEL EXPECTED IN AS THE VIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATION. I I NEED TANGIBLE RESULTS THAT I CAN SEE -- TO BE ABLE TO SAVE NEXT YEAR. LET'S DO IT AGAIN. LET'S ADVANCE OF LOCAL WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED SO THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR WHEN I GO FORWARD IT'S GREAT. TO TO GET EXTRA MONEY. WHAT WE GET FOR IT? THIS WILL LOOK. FOR WONDERFUL THANK YOU MUST FRAZIER -- I COULD MEDICARE THAT'S MISTER FRAZIER SAPLING. WHEN OUR MEMBERS WERE -- CONCEDING THAT CAL OR THE OUTCOMES AN ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW. IDEA ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE WERE FACING WAS THE INABILITY TO ARTICULATE WITH DATA. WHAT YOU'RE GETTING FOR THE MONEY WE KNEW WE WERE DOING GOOD THINGS WE'RE PROUD OF THE WORK WE WERE DOING BUT WE AS A STATE? NEVER ARTICULATED THE OUTCOMES WE DIDN'T GATHER THE DATA TO TRACK THEM -- AND SO A KEY. REASON BEHIND THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE NEW OUT COMES AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO EXACTLY THE NEED THAT YOU JUST ARTICULATED GOOD ANSWER. THANK YOU. I HAVE ALSO EL STAFF TO TO WORK WITH TO TO WORK WITH YOU. TO FIND WAYS THAT WERE INTERESTED I THINK I THINK I SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUES AND I IN FORMALIZING YVR CODIFYING. THE INTENT THAT OF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS. TO TO TO IN DOORS THE TWO OF WHAT WHAT WE WITH CALOR IS IN TWO K. -- CAL WORKS TO PORTO THE THIS ISWHERE WE WANT TO SHIFT THIS IS WHERE WE WANT TO GO -- AND I THINK THAT I I I DO WANT STAFF TO WORK WITH YOU TO FIGURE. THE LANGUAGE -- SO THAT THAT CAN BE CODIFIED AND THERE WE KNOW THE DIRECTION WE'RE TRAVELING IN. BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A VERY GOOD THING. THANK YOU THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. ALL RIGHT THEN IF WE MAY -- LET'S MOVE. TO TWO ISSUE NUMBER. THREE WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEEKS IS HERE SO AFTER THE GOVERNOR AFTER THAT THE THE GOVERNOR'S PRESENTATION -- AS IT IS THERE PROPOSAL I LIKE TO HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUE. YES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE TASHA NIKOLAI AGAIN FROM DSS. WANT TO NOTE HERE AGAIN AT THE AGENDA PAGE TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY TWO HAS A GOOD SUMMARY OF THE HOME VISITING PROGRAM INTO THAT I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY EXCITED TO BE LAUNCHING THE CAL WORKS ON VISITING INITIATIVE IN FORTY FOUR COUNTIES IN THIS FOR CYCLE. LEVERAGING HOME VISITING SERVICES INTO THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM PRESENTS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE TO GENERATION POLICIES THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF BOTH THE PARENTS AND THE CHILDREN. COUNTIES ARE LEVERAGING FOR EVIDENCE BASED MODELS INCLUDING HEALTHY FAMILIES AMERICA APPEARANCES TEACHERS NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIPS AND EARLY HEAD START AS WELL AS FOR HOME GROWN INITIATIVES THAT. HAVE MET THE ROBUST REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET INCLUDES A PROPOSAL TO MAKE HOME VISITING AN ONGOING PROGRAM COMPONENT COMPONENT IN THE COLLEGE PROGRAM [inaudible] THANK YOU. IT WAS SHORT AND SWEET MS WICKS THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. WE YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT UNMET BASIC NEEDS ECONOMIC HARBOR HARDSHIP HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE THE SHORT AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF FOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN IN THE STATE -- AND TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES WE KNOW THAT HOME VISITING PROGRAMS ARE REALLY POWERFUL TOOLS TO HELP THESE FAMILIES THAT ARE IN REALLY -- IN DESPERATE NEED -- DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW THAT THESE PROGRAMS TO TALK ABOUT ARE A WHY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THESE PROGRAMS CAN GENERATE YOU KNOW PUBLIC SAVINGS BY INCREASING HEALTHY BIRTHS. PROMOTING SCHOOL READINESS REDUCING CHILD MALTREATMENT AND INCREASING FAMILY SELF SUFFICIENCY THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE KNOW THAT THESE PROGRAMS WORK AND THEY'RE REALLY STRONG INVESTMENTS [inaudible] THEREFORE. I AM REQUEST RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE BUILD UPON THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL OF SAID SEVENTY EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION FUNDING FOR CAL WORKS HOME VISITING INITIATIVE THROUGH KEY. AMENDMENTS AND BY ALLOCATING AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION. ON GOING TO THE PROGRAM TO SERVE THESE FAMILIES RIGHT NOW WE ARE ONLY SERVING 8% OF THE CAL WORKS FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWO AND FRANKLY WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE MILLIONS OF% CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY IN THE STATE. AND THESE ARE DISPROPORTIONATE CHILDREN OF COLOR. AND SO THERE'S A RACIAL EQUITY LENDS HERE I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT SUPPORTING STRONG SOCIAL SAFETY NET PRO PROGRAM'S REALLY HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD -- FOR THESE KIDS AND SO WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS. PARENTING A YOUNG CHILD. IS AN ENORMOUS STRESS AND I KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD. OF IT PLACES THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL DEMANDS ON ON ADULTS AND SOME FAMILIES MAY NOT HAVE WHAT THEY NEED. A OR KNOW WHERE TO GO WHERE TO GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. AND HOME VISITING PROGRAMS REALLY HELP PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT FOR THOSE FAMILIES SO I AM MAKING THIS REQUEST I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COALITION OF GREAT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CHILDREN NOW AND OTHERS ON THIS. I THANK YOU FOR A CHEN ISING THIS ITEM TODAY AND FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN FAMILIES [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANGELA ROTH AMONG ROUGHER MAIL. GOOD AFTERNOON TO PRONOUNCE IT CORRECTLY. CLOSE ENOUGH NO NO WOOD. MY NAME IS ANGELA RATHER MAIL FROM CHILDREN NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. I'M IN THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS -- I'M HERE TODAY TO RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR COMMITTEE TO BUILD UPON THE GOVERNOR'S PRPOSAL IN THE CAL WORKS. HOME VISITING INITIATIVE AND ALLOCATE AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS INCORPORATE SOME KEY TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE VOLUNTARY EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING FOR OUR FAMILIES. INCREASING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH POINTS EARLY CHILDHOOD IS A CRUCIAL PERIOD OF TIME NOT JUST FOR CHILDREN'S. DEVELOPMENT BUT ALSO -- TO INVESTING IN FAMILIES AS A WHOLE FOR LIFELONG WELL BEING AND SUCCESS. I'M IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF LIFE BABIES BRAINS ARE FORMING ONE MILLION NEURAL CONNECTIONS EVERY SECOND. AND ITS RELATIONSHIPS HEALTHY POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS THAT -- FUEL THAT HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. POVERTY AN UNMET BASIC NEEDS IN FAMILIES CAN WEAKEN THIS ARCHITECTURE BUT STABLE RELATIONSHIPS AND PARA POSITIVE PARENT CHILD INTERACTIONS BUT FOR THE IMPACTS OF ADVERSITY AND THAT CAN ACTUALLY FOSTER CRITICAL LIFELONG PROTECTIVE FACTORS IN CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. WE APPLAUD THE ASSEMBLY FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP LAST YEAR AND PUSHING GOVERNOR BROWN IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE A BIG VISION AROUND THE CAL WORKS HOME VISITING INITIATIVE. WHILE THE COW WORKS EACH BE I REPRESENTS AN UNPRECEDENTED EXPANSION OF EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING IN FORTY FOUR COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. CURRENT FUNDING WILL ONLY GO FAR ENOUGH TO REACH AN ESTIMATED 8% OF THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION. THE CAL WORKS HOME VISITING INITIATIVE ENCOURAGES COUNTIES TO LEVERAGE EXISTING LOCAL EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING PROGRAMS WHILE ALSO EMPHASIZING ACCOUNTABILITY TO INSURE POSITIVE OUTCOMES WHICH IS SMART POLICY -- KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS APPROACH WILL BE SMARTLY INTEGRATING THE H. B. I. INTO LOCAL EARLY CHILDHOOD CONTACTS AND LANDSCAPES AS WELL AS HAVING ROBUST TO DATA TO EVALUATE IMPACTS TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE THE PROGRAM. ACROSS CALIFORNIA THERE'S A DIVERSE ARRAY. OF EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING PROGRAMS ANCHORED WITHIN LOCAL AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS AND UNTIL THE HISTORIC CREATION OF THE CALYX EACH BE AYE LAST YEAR THIS NETWORK WAS SOLELY FUNDED THROUGH FEDERAL AND LOCAL FUNDS. THIS LANDSCAPE WITH MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS AND SIMILAR BUT VERY DATA COLLECTION MECHANISMS -- CAN -- BRING STRONG POTENTIAL TO LEVERAGE BUT IT ALSO CAN BRING -- INEFFICIENCIES AND SO WE HAVE TO BE THOUGHTFUL IN TERMS OF HOW WE SCALE UP THE KELLER TGI. HALF OF THE COUNTIES IN THE TO BE I ALSO HAVE FEDERALLY FUNDED CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HOME VISITING SITES. AND MANY IF NOT ALL HAVE EARLY HEAD START FEDERAL TO LOCAL HOME VISITING PROGRAMS IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND FIRST FIVE COMMISSION FUNDED HOME VISITING EFFORTS. THESE PARTNERS ARE PROVING A RELIABLE TO HELP SCALE THESE EFFORTS FOR EXAMPLE STAKEHOLDERS FROM SAN BERNADINO THE COUNTY RECEIVING THE SECOND LARGEST AWARD THREE THE HPI. SHARED WITH ME JUST LAST WEEK THE NEED FOR LOCAL ENTITIES TO PAINT BETTER CONNECT AND LEVERAGE ONE ANOTHER TOWARD THE SUCCESS OF THIS EFFORT. WHEN LOCAL PROGRAMS COLLABORATE AND ARE CONNECTED THEY WERE BETTER WORK TOGETHER TO MAXIMIZE SCARCE RESOURCES AND SERVE FAMILIES IN THEIR COMMUNITY? THEY STAND READY TO HELP THE STATE ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE H. B. I. BUT THEY NEED HELP. SO THE EARLY YEARS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION ARE CRITICAL TO CATALYZE THE CREATION OF LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD UP AND MAXIMIZE NETWORKS OF SUPPORT. TO LEVERAGE DIVERSE NON TANNER RESOURCES TO SUPPORT TWO GENERATIONS IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM -- EFFECTIVE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEMS MUST BE BACKED BY INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL ALLOW FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS LOCAL IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES. TO COORDINATE AND PLAN EFFECTIVE INTERAGENCY SYSTEMS -- ESTABLISHED STRONG STATE LOCAL FEEDBACK LOOPS AROUND PROGRESS AND BARRIERS RESPOND ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING NEEDS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY DO THE HARD WORK TO NASH AND IT EXISTING DATA MECHANISM SO THAT WE HAVE WHAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS AFFECTED. WERE ALSO REQUESTING TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO IMPROVE THE COWARDS H. B. I. AS OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA -- IN PARTICULAR CLARIFY THAT ALL FAMILIES PARTICIPATING AND CAL WORKS WHO ARE PREGNANT OR PARENTING A CHILD UNDER AGE TWO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE SUPPORTS. CLARIFY THAT INDIVIDUALS DETERMINED TO BE PRESUMPTIVELY ELIGIBLE FOR OUR CAL WORKS EXCUSE ME ARE ALSO -- ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE HOME VISITING SO THAT SERVICES CAN BEGIN AS SOON A PREGNANCY AS POSSIBLE -- FI THAT SERVING NON CUSTODIAL PARENTS IS ALLOWABLE SO THAT SPLIT CUSTODY FAMILIES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN HOME VISITING IF THAT IS THEIR DESIRE AND PREFERENCE. AND ALSO TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE CAT TO THE COW WORKS HOME VISITING PROGRAM TO REFLECTING MIRROR ON THE NAMING OF OTHER SIMILAR ON PARTS OF THE CAL WORKS ARE RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NO COME AT THIS TIME HELLO. WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH WITH YOUR STAFF ON YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE OF THE PROPOSAL IN ADDITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- THAT WE HAVE NO COMMENTS ON THAT WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND FOR THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT IS YOUR THINKING ABOUT SPECIFIC POINTS ON THE FUNDING. ON THE ADVOCATES PROPOSAL ON THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. SURE THE TASHA NIKOLAI FROM DSS. ARE THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THE PROPOSAL FROM THE ADVOCATES HAS MERIT AND THAT FAMILIES WITH MORE THAN ONE CHILD CAN BENEFIT FROM HOME VISITING AND THEN AN EARLY INTRODUCTION TO HOME VISITING IN A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH DOES BENEFIT FAMILIES. TWENTY SIX OF THE FORTY FOUR PARTICIPATING COUNTIES TO DATE -- PLAN TO SERVE EXPANDED POPULATIONS NOW OF THESE TWENTY ONE PLAN TO SERVE PARENTS WITH MORE THAN ONE CHILD FIVE PLAN TO EXPAND SERVICES THE CAL LEARN OR TEEN PARENT CASELOADS. AND FIVE PLANNED TO EXPAND TO SERVE PARENTS WITH OLDER CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWO AND FIVE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT COUNTIES OF EXPERIENCE SOME IMPLEMENTATION DELAYS ARE RELATED TO LOCAL CONTRACTING PROCESSES BOARD OF SUPERVISOR APPROVALS HIRING AND TRAINING OF HOME VISITORS AND DEVELOPING THEM A USING. DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY TRACK TO PROGRAMS -- THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED IN PLANS ON GOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SESSIONS TO SUPPORT THE COUNTIES REALLY REALLY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESSES -- AND WILL WANT TO CONSIDER THE TIME NEEDED IS NOTED TO BUILD CAPACITY AND IDENTIFY HOW MUCH GROWTH HOME VISITING PROGRAMS CAN SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH IN ONE YEAR -- AND IN ADDITION WE SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT WE LEARN ABOUT THE UPTAKE OF IT AS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM MOVING FORWARD. NOT FOOD FINALLY KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES A PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE HOME VISITING PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY C. PH BY ABOUT TWENTY ONE MILLION. THE ADVOCATES -- NOTED AND IT'S STATED THAT PAID THE BOTTOM OF PAGE. THIRTY ONE AND TOP OF PAGE. THIRTY TWO THE FOR SPECIFIC. PROPOSALS A LANGUAGE CHANGES. IS THE ADMINISTRATION AVAILABLE TO THESE CHANGES. TARA FINANCED HER WORDS. NOT AT THIS TIME CONSIDERING THAT THOSE. CHANGES WOULD RESULT IN COST PRESSURES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND OTHERS COST PRESSURES -- WOULD THEY BE ALLEVIATED WITH THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION. AS ADDRESSED BY MS WICKS -- AT AT THIS TIME WE HAVEN'T DELVED DOWN INTO THOSE NUMBERS -- TO THE EXTENT IT DOES BECOME A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE WE CAN LOOK INTO THOSE NUMBERS AND HOW THESE LANGUAGE CHANGES TRANSLATE INTO FUNDING AND COST PRESSURES. THANK YOU I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE LONG TIME ADVOCATES. WORKING IN THE SPACE -- SAID TO ME -- THAT. THE THIS WOULD BE LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE. TO HAVE IT UNIVERSAL'S TO HAVE THIS OFFERED IT TO TO THE MOTHERS -- WITH KIDS TWO AND UNDER. SO IF WE'RE ABLE TO TO MAKE A CHANGE AND AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SHIFT CHANGES SO THEY WERE REALLY ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN TO TAKE CARE OF THE FAMILY AND HERE OFFER IT SO IT'S NOT JUST 8%. AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- BUT IF SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED IN THE SPACE SAYS THIS WOULD BE A DREAM COME TRUE WE GOT TO WORK ON MAKING THOSE DREAMS COME TRUE AND FIGURE OUT WAYS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BUDGET REQUESTS AND AND PRIORITIES AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS IT NEEDS TO BE DONE? SO I I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO WORK WITH THE WITH THE STAFF AND DO WITH THE ADVOCATES TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET. THIS THIS LANGUAGE AND AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE. I THANK YOU FOR THAT. YES MISTER ROBERTS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND JUST SOME REAL QUICK ON THE ON THE TEN IF IN THOUGH I A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION COMING IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. WE KNOW THAT -- CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE LARGEST POPULATION OF NATIVE AMERICANS -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MANY TIMES WE LOOK AT THE FEDERAL FUNDING GOING TOWARDS THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION HOWEVER. WITH THE HIGH POPULATION IN THE STATE ITSELF LOOKING AT WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING WAS BEING PROPOSED HERE WITH THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION. ARE WE ASSURING THAT ACTUALLY THOSE GROUPS ALSO WOULD BE -- TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THESE VISITS TAKE PLACE. SO IN ADDITION TO THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENT SUPPORTS ATA TRIBAL TENNIS PROGRAM -- THE TRIBAL TENNIS PROGRAM AS IN TWENTY THREE TRIBES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE EACH TRIBE HAS THEIR OWN PROGRAM DESIGN OF THAT SERVICE RATE THAT'S OFFERED WITHIN THEIR TEN OF PROGRAM. IN ADDITION MEMBERS OF THE TRIBE CAN CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRIBAL TENNIS PROGRAM IN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC REGION OR THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM THE CAN'T BE DULY ENROLLED BUT THEY CAN CHOOSE. TO PARTICIPATE IN EITHER PROGRAM SO TO THE EXTENT THAT AT THE THE FORTY FOUR COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY OUT VOLUNTARILY OPTING INTO PROVIDING CAO WORK SOME VISITING IN THE SPUR CYCLE. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE TRIBAL TENNIS PROGRAM THAT PARTICULAR REGION OFFERED HOME VISITING THAT WOULD BE THE VARIABLE TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT AT INDIVIDUAL WILL BE. AT HAVE ACCESS TO A HOME VISITING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE ISSUES IS INSANE THAT AND HERE IN THE DISCUSSION THANK YOU FOR FOR THOSE. UNCOMMON TO SEE IN THE TRAVEL COMMUNITY AS FAR AS WHAT'S ON THE FEDERAL INDIAN RESERVATION BUT YEAH WE HAVE A HIGH POPULATION LIVING IN THE URBAN AREAS. AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY FUNDING THAT MOVES FORWARD STARTS TO TAKE CARE OF THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA GENERAL WHICH AGAIN. HOLDS THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF NATIVE AMERICANS -- INDIA ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION SO BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH YOUR SPOUSE OR SOMEONE ELSE WITH YOU IN MY OFFICE TO IDENTIFY HOW WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB. AT DOING THAT BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN HERE ON THIS -- COMMITTEE DUSTED CYSTIC SO THE RATIOS OF AMERICAN INDIAN PEOPLE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH THE RACES ARE SO MUCH HIGHER. THAN THE COURTS OF OF OTHER GROUPS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK TRYING TO BRING SOME SOME AWARENESS SOME EDUCATIONAL COMPONENTS TO THAT THEN WE LOOK A SERVICING THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION. THAT IT'S JUST NOT HERE IS TO AN INDIAN RESERVATION AND THEN IT STOPS THERE. THEY'RE MEMBERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT LIVE IN THE URBAN AREAS IS STILL NEED THE SERVICES THAT ARE THERE SO I WOULD -- WELCOME TO THE CHAIR -- ANY DIALOGUE THAT WE COULD HAVE TO MAKE SURE AND INSURE THAT WHEN THESE VISITS TAKE PLACE. THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN PEOPLE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TAKING CARE OF ALSO AT THE SAME TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER ROSS YES MISTER FRAZIER. AND YOU'D MENTIONED IN THE TALK ABOUT THE FORTY FOUR COUNTIES THAT ARE OPTED INVOLUNTARILY. BUT IN THE OTHERS. GOOD QUESTION SO -- VARIETY OF REASONS IN SOME CASES IT COULD BE SO LET LET ME BACK UP A LITTLE BIT TO SAY THAT. THE COW WORK SOME VISITING INITIATIVE WAS DESIGNED IN A WAY TO LEVERAGE AND BUILD UPON WHAT HOME VISITING EFFORTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN BIG BEGAN TO THE MATERNAL INFANT EARLY CHILDHOOD HOME VISITING FIND AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO THROUGH. OTHER LOCALLY FUNDED INITIATIVES AND AND SO IN TERMS OF AT CAPACITY AND WHICH COUNTIES HAVE EXISTING HOME VISITING PROGRAMS PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION LAUNCH OF THE COUCH SOME VISITING INITIATIVE. THAT DOES VERY NOT EVERY SINGLE COUNTY ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAS THE HOME VISITING PROGRAM. IN OUR DESIGN EVER APPLICATION WE DID TO TO MITIGATE THAT AT ALLOW FOR REGIONAL APPROACHES SO MULTIPLE COUNTIES ARE AT OR AT HOME VISITING ENTITY COULD SERVE MULTIPLE. REGIONS WE DID NOT RECEIVE -- AT ANY OF THOSE TYPES OF APPLICATIONS IN SOME CASES IT'S ALSO JUST IN TERMS OF THE MODELS IN THE SPECIFICITY OF THE MALL FOR EXAMPLE -- STANLEY PARTNERSHIP WHICH REQUIRES A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE IN SOME CASES THAT'S NOT A VIABLE -- PERCENT THERE'S NOT NOT ENOUGH OF A POPULATION -- TO MATCH THE CASELOAD THAT THAT THAT NURSE MIGHT CARRY SO THERE WERE THERE SOME VARIATION IN TERMS OF CASELOAD CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL AS CAPACITY. A MAHOOD UPON VISITING AND WE DO PLAN IN OUR NEXT SPENDING CYCLE TO AGAIN OFFER REGIONAL APPROACH AND PROVIDES MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SEE IF THAT WOULD HELP. ENSURE IT STATE WIDE. BECAUSE I KNOW LAST YEAR THAT I CARRIED A BILL THAT REQUIRED HEALTH PLANS AND HOSPITALS. TO HAVE -- OUT. IN HOME CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS YOUNG MOTHERS. ARE MOTHERS WHO -- BECAUSE THERE ARE BEEN A HIGH. A SUICIDE RATE ALSO OF THE THE INABILITY. TO TO BUILT IN -- THEY WERE OVERWHELMED RIGHT AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY WE COULDN'T COMBINE THOSE TWO PROCESSES WHERE THERE'S A DEFICIENCY IN. FROM IN YOU KNOW THE WHAT IS IT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SO MINUS. FORTY FOUR YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN COUNTIES ARE TAKING CARE OF IN THAT REALM WITH HEALTH ALLIANCE CAN ACTUALLY OR THE THE HOSPITAL'S CAN. AUGMENT THAT. THE COMMISSION CHECK. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER. I WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL AND AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MS WORKS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FRANK MICHAEL WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION HERE TO PRESENT -- ITEM FOR ON YOUR AGENDA. IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHEN THE LEGISLATURE WAS SITTING -- IN ROOMS JUST LIKE THIS ONE OF THE TENETS OF THE BI PARTISAN CAL WORKS -- BILL WAS THAT WORK SHOULD PAY. IF WE EXPECT PEOPLE GETTING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE TO WORK. THERE SHOULD BE AN INCENTIVE AND THERE SHOULD BE SUPPORT FOR THAT WORK THEY SHOULD NOT LOSE THEIR GRANT DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR FOR WHAT THEY EARN. SO THE MECHANISM FOR OPERATIONALIZE THING THAT TENET. IS THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD. WE ALLOW CLIENTS TO KEEP TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND EARN -- BUT AS OPPOSED -- TO A SYSTEM WHERE THEY WOULD LOSE MORE OF THEIR CHARACTER -- HAS EARNINGS GO UP. THE GRANT GRADUALLY COMES DOWN AND SO DURING THAT TIME A CLIENT CAN COMBINE THEIR EARNINGS. THERE GRANT AND THEIR WORK SUPPORTS LIKE TRANSPORTATION OR CHILD CARE. SO THEY COULD GRADUALLY MOVE FROM RECEIPT OF AID TO SELF SUFFICIENCY WE WANTED TO CREATE A BRIDGE TO SELF SUFFICIENCY NOT A CLIFF. AND THAT WAS A KEY TENET OF THE BIPARTISAN CHOLERIC SPELL. THE PROBLEM IS YOUR AGENDA LAYS OUT BASED ON AN EXCELLENT REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER. IS THAT THE WORK INCENTIVES THAT THE LEGISLATURE CREATED FOR THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM HAS DEGRADED SIGNIFICANTLY AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD HASN'T BEEN UPDATED IN TWENTY YEARS. INFLATION IN THE MINIMUM WAGE HAVE SO SIGNIFICANTLY DEGRADED THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD THAT WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS MORE LIKE A CLIFF -- THEN A BRIDGE. HAD IT BEEN UPDATED FOR INFLATION AND FOR CHANGES IN THE MINIMUM WAGE WE WOULD BE DISREGARDING FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ABOUT RIGHT ABOUT ROUND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND 50%. OF THE BALANCE NOT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE AND AS A RESULT WERE JEOPARDIZING THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE -- IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT A PERSON WITH A FULL TIME MINIMUM WAGE WORK WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR GRANT. THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR WORK SUPPORTS -- FROM THE COW WORKS PROGRAM. THEY WOULD NOT EXIT OFF THE PROGRAM UNTIL THEIR EARNINGS EXCEEDED FULL TIME MINIMUM WAGE WORK. THAT VERY SAME CLIENT TODAY EARNING MINIMUM WAGE IS INELIGIBLE FOR CALYX. AND SO NOT ONLY DO THEY LOSE THAT THAT THE SUPPORT OF THE GRANT BUT THEY ALSO LOSE THE WORK SUPPORTS THAT GO ALONG WITH -- WITH THE COWART'S PROGRAM. HAD WE INDEX THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD FOR INFLATION IN THE MINIMUM WAGE. THAT SAME CLIENT THAT I TALKED ABOUT WOULD HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH MORE. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. FOR A FAMILY WORKING REALLY HARD TO TRY TO MOVE THEMSELVES FROM PUBLIC ASSISTANCE INTO THE WORK FORCE. AND THE CURRENT SITUATION LEAVES A TERRIBLE CATCH TWENTY TWO FOR WORKING CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS. TURN DOWN A SHIFT. SO I DON'T LOSE THE VITAL WORK SUPPORTS OR INCREASE MY WORK BECAUSE I WANT TO BUT THEN LOSE THE KEY THINGS THAT ALLOWED ME. TO SORT OF GET THE TO TO GET THE JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT SKYROCKETING RENTS HAVE ACTUALLY MADE THE PROBLEM MUCH WORSE BECAUSE RENTS HAVE RISEN ABOUT THREE TIMES FASTER THAN WAGES AND INFLATION. AND SO. I THINK IT'S ARGUABLE THAT THE EXIT POINT FOR CAL WORKS SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN IT WAS IN INFLATION ADJUSTED TERMS THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE AS CLIENTS LEAVE -- CAL WORKS WITH RENTS THAT ARE SO HIGH THE ABILITY TO TO REMAIN. HOUSE AND TO REMAIN EMPLOYED AND NOT NEED TO COME BACK ON TO PUBLIC ASSISTANCE IS THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE RENTS ARE SO HIGH. SO SEAT EVERY DAY AS A PROPOSAL IT'S ACTUALLY REFLECTED IN AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX STONE WERE HAPPY TO WORK ON THIS ALONG WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. TO RAISE THE DISREGARD OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS IN INTO CERTAIN INCREMENTS. TO UPDATE IT TO ACCOUNT FOR INCREASES IN INFLATION IN THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND THEN EVENTUALLY INDEX IT FOR INFLATION THEREAFTER SO WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME DEGRADATION THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE PAST. TWENTY YEARS THAT WOULD RESTORE THE POLICY TO WHERE THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED IT TO BE ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO WHEN IT CREATED THE COWARDS PROGRAM -- A SIDE BENEFIT IS THAT IT WOULD IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S FEDERAL WORK PARTICIPATION RATE BECAUSE AS THOSE WORKING PEOPLE LEAVE THE ROLES WE NO LONGER GET CREDIT FOR THEM IN THE FEDERAL WORK PARTICIPATION RATE. SO YOU REDUCE THE RISK OF FEDERAL PENALTIES IN ADDITION TO HELPING PEOPLE AVOID A CLIFF -- AND SO WE THINK THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR THIS THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE A VERY SIMILAR CHANGE IN THE EARNED AND INCOME TAX CREDIT. IN OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE CHILD CARE -- TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN THE MINIMUM WAGE WE THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE IT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WAY. TO HELP RESTORE CAL WORKS TO ITS ORIGINAL INTENT WHICH WAS TO REALLY SUPPORT THE TRANSITION TO PEOPLE MOVING FROM. PUBLIC ASSISTANCE TO WORK WITHOUT PULLING THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THEM [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] WAS JOHNSON. HOUSE SPEAKER THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU. LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE TASHA THANK YOU -- SO THE DEPARTMENT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT THE ID IS OVERDUE FOR AN UPDATE ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERING THE ON GOING AND PLANNED UPDATES TO THE MINIMUM WAGE AND SUPPORTS PROGRESS THAT ALLOWS AND INCENTIVIZE IS FAMILIES TO ENGAGE IN THE WORK FORCE WHILE STABILIZING AND DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL SKILLS FOR OVERCOMING ADVERSITY. AND ENCOURAGES AND THE CONSIDERATION OF HOW THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS FOR INVESTMENTS INTERACT -- AND WOULD SUGGEST THE SORT OF THE CAN BE COMBINING THEIR FOR IT CONSIDERING THE ASSOCIATED COSTS AS WELL AS A PRIORITY IS. WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EXAMINE FISCAL RESULTS IN A LINE WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES IN POSITIONS. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD EXPECT -- AS MR MECCA NOTED THAT THIS PROPOSAL COULD SUPPORT AN INCREASE IN THE WORK PARTICIPATION RATES -- AND FINALLY CAL OR DOES INCLUDE MEASURES THAT WILL TELL US HOW THE EARNINGS OF PARTICIPANTS CHANGE OVER TIME AND WILL BE HELPFUL AND ILLUSTRATED IN THIS IN THIS REGARD. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. SOUNDED LIKE A POSITIVE RESPONSE INDEED YES. HELLO WHO WHO DO WE HEAR FROM NOT NEXT -- FROM THE FINANCE. TO VERIFY ITS HER WORDS AS MISS NICOLE I NOTED -- MERITS OF THIS POLICY. PROPOSAL NOT WAS STANDING WE WOULD NOT SUPPORT THIS TIME GIVEN THE THE COSTS SURROUNDING THESE AND IT'S HAVING NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET. THANK YOU HELLO A LA -- JAZZ ALL OVER THE LA L. -- WE HAVE NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME ON THIS PROPOSAL BUT HAPPY TO WORK WITH STATUTES THAT SIMPLY CONSIDERS IT [inaudible] THANK YOU. MR BACK I ALSO I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA -- IT IS. MANY IN IN THIS AREA NO HAVE BEEN MAJOR PARTNERS IN IT NOW SET IN THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- IN LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE IN LOOKING AT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD IT ISN'T JUST THAT. YOU ARE THE DIRECTORS AND JUST GIVE ME THE PROGRAMMER WILL TAKE CARE OF IT BUT NO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE PROGRAM WE SEE THE BIG PICTURE. YEAH WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT TO END UP LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE HOW WE GET THERE. AND THERE ARE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WILL BE MADE TO THE BUDGET JUST AS MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT -- AND IT'S FIGURING OUT WITH PRIORITIES ARE AND IT WITH ALL OF THESE IT'S FIGURING OUT WHEN WE'RE GOING TO DO THEM. AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THEM BUT DO THEM WE MUST AND I SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR MY COLLEAGUES. VERY GOOD LET'S MOVE ON THEN TO ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TIME CLOCK. MR HELD BEFORE YOU BEGIN. EARLIER YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT TO THE TWIN THERE ARE -- WE HAVE THERE ARE YOU DIDN'T USE THE WORD LOBBYISTS THAT THERE ARE ADVOCATES. FOR SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS -- THAT -- HELLO WHAT THE WORD IS HIGH PAID -- BUT THEN WE HAVE THOSE WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED. AND IF THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE ADVOCATES AND THAT'S ONE ONE WE WELCOME. THOSE WHO ARE WORKING WITH THEM THAT'S WHY WHEN SEIU IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR WORK AS IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICE. WORKERS ARE WHEN WITH THE CHILD CARE WORKERS. IT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE AREN'T THOSE HIGH PAID LOBBYISTS WHO COME IN AND ADVOCATE FOR THE VERY PEOPLE THEY'RE SERVING. I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE YOUR VOICE IS SO IMPORTANT TO ADD YOUR YOUR ORGANIZATION'S VOICES SO IMPORTANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ADVOCATES ARE AT THE TABLE THAT THE VERY PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO SERVE IN EVERYTHING THAT WE DO. OUR START ALREADY AT THE TABLE REPRESENTED FOR LIKE WITH PEOPLE SUCH AS YOURSELF I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THEM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU. ALL RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TIME CLOCK OKAY -- AGAIN MY CAROL. POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- SO -- I BELIEVE I CAN SAY THIS FACTUALLY CORRECT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF YOUR CONSULTANT -- NONE OF YOU WERE HERE I BELIEVE DURING THE TIMES WHERE WE MADE REALLY ENORMOUS BUDGET. RELATED. CHANGES TO THE TOWERS PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND WE WEREN'T HERE BUT WE WERE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE WERE. PAINED DURING THOSE TIMES AND THAT IS WHY OUR OUR CONSULTANT TO IS SO IMPORTANT TO THIS COMMITTEE DID SHE IS. AND I WOULDN'T WANT ANY OF YOU TO EVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE I AM SINCERELY -- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID DURING THAT TIME AS WE MADE VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CAL ARTS PROGRAMS -- IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN ALL OF THIS REALLY BEING DRIVEN BY THE THE DIRE NATURE OF OUR STATE BUDGET THAT POINT WE'RE YOU KNOW. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN IN DEFICITS IN THE GOVERNOR WAS TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO BRING THE STATE'S -- FISCAL HOUSE BACK IN ORDER -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS DONE WAS THAT WE WE DID TWO MAJOR THINGS TO CAL WORKS -- WE DO MANY THINGS WE DID TWO MAJOR THINGS WE REDUCE THE NUMBER OF MONTHS FROM SIXTY MONTHS. TO FORTY EIGHT THAT PUTS CALIFORNIA IN THE MINORITY OF STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY EVEN STATES LIKE MISSISSIPPI HAVE A SIXTY MONTH TIME CLOCK FOR TAN OF BENEFITS. OUR STATE DOES NOT -- SECONDARILY -- THE FOLLOWING YEAR WE TOOK THOSE FORTY EIGHT MONTHS AND WE DIVIDE THEM INTO TWO PIECES. THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS WAS CHANGE IN WHAT WAS CALLED A FLEXIBLE CLOCK WHICH ALLOWED RECIPIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY ACTIVITY THAT THE ASSESSMENT DONE BY THE COUNTY DETERMINE WAS NEEDED. FOR THEM. THAT WAS POTENTIALLY POSITIVE. BUT AFTER TWENTY FOUR MONTHS WE'VE THEN IMPOSED A THE THE CANNOT WORK FOR WORK REQUIREMENT RULES WHICH WERE MORE RIGID THAN ARE EVEN. CALIFORNIA STATE ROLES THAT -- HAD BEEN IN PLACE FOR THE LAST DECADE AND A HALF -- THE THE EFFECTIVE THAT REALLY WAS FOR MANY CLIENTS IS THAT THEY REALLY FELT LIKE THEY THEY THEY HAD TO GET ALL EVERYTHING DONE IN THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. IT REALLY -- MADE CREATED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CONFUSION NOT JUST FOR OUR RECIPIENTS -- IN OUR CLIENTS AS WE SOMETIMES CALL THEM BUT ALSO FOR THE COUNTY WORKERS TRYING TO EXPLAIN HOW TWENTY FOUR MONTHS WORK THE OTHER TWENTY FOUR MONTH CLOCK WORK. HOW THE EXTENSION POLICIES WORK -- WAS ENORMOUSLY CONFUSING AND AND REMEMBER THIS IS A POPULATION THAT WHEN THEY COME IN THE DOOR TO THE COUNTY WELFARE OFFICE THAT FIRST DAY THEY'RE OFTEN IN CRISIS THERE. THERE ARE HOMELESS THEY HAVE A CURRENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION AND IN THEIR LIFE THEY'VE -- THEY MAY BE GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE IS ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN HIS FAMILY'S LIFE AND THEN WE THROW ALL THIS INFORMATION OUT ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT CLOCKS -- RAND ACTUALLY DID AN ANALYSIS FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN THE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS AND AND ESSENTIALLY CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION. THAT THE THAT MOVING TO THESE TWO TWENTY FOUR MONTH CLOCKS REALLY HAD NO APPRECIABLE IMPACT ON THE PROGRAM AND REALLY DIDN'T BENEFIT -- CERTAINLY NOT THE RECIPIENTS AND IT REALLY WASN'T. DOING ANYTHING TO REALLY MOVE INVOLVEMENT PARTICIPATION AN ACCOMPLISHMENT IN THE WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM. SO FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS A FAILED POLICY AND ON THOSE GROUNDS TO BEGIN WITH WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE. TO REVERSE THAT DECISION IN THIS BUDGET -- IN IN IN IN PARTICULAR I WOULD NOTE THAT THE WAY THAT THE CURRENT FORTY EIGHT MONTH CLOCK IS STRUCTURED WITH THE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTH CLOCKS. IS A DIRECT IMPEDIMENT TO THE ABILITY OF WELL WE DESCRIBED EARLIER AROUND THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING ROLLED OUT AROUND CAL WORKS TWO POINT NO. CAL OR THESE ARE REALLY MORE MODERN PROGRAMS THAT OUR FAMILY FOCUS GOAL ORIENTED SO HAVING. A PROGRAM IN WHICH THE COUNTY CANNOT MEET THE CLIENT WHERE THEY'RE AT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS FEDERAL OVERLAY OF RULES THAT REQUIRES. THEM TO HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN WHAT AND WORK FIRST ALL IN WORK FIRST IS THE PRINCIPAL AND FRANKLY ONLY ACTIVITY FOR MANY. IT'S GOING TO ACT AS A AS A SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT TO OUR ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS NEW APPROACH THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EARLIER TODAY. SO WE REALLY SEE THE NEED -- WALL WE'RE NOT ASKING -- FOR STATUTORY CHANGES BROADLY WITH THAT IN THE WALL FOR WORK PROGRAM AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE THINK A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WOULD BE THE PROPER THE PROPER WAY TO PROCEED ON THAT. IN THIS AREA WE ARE ASKING FOR THE TWENTY FOUR MONTH CLOCK. WITH THE FEDERAL RULES TO BE ELIMINATED AND THAT WE TAKE THE TWENTY FOUR MONTH FLEXIBLE APPROACH AND ADOPT THAT FOR THE AN EXTENDED OUT TO THE FULL LIMIT OF THE FEDERAL LAW. OF SIXTY MONTHS ON THE TAN A PROGRAM THE TWENTY THE FLEXIBLE CLOCK COMPORTS PERFECTLY WITH THE NEW DIRECTION THAT WE'RE GOING AND WE THINK THAT THAT OUGHT TO BECOME THE STANDARD THAT WE USE IN THE CALPERS PROGRAM GOING FORWARD -- ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE REALLY THINK THE SIXTY MONTH CLOCK NEEDS TO BE RESTORED. IS AS YOU HEARD EARLIER WE BELIEVE THAT EDUCATION IS THE KEY TO OUR CLIENTS SUCCESS OVER THE LONG TERM. BUT 50% OF THE PARTICIPANTS TO COMMON TO THE COUCH BERMAN THE FIRST DAY DON'T HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. THEY DON'T HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA SO THE IDEA THAT THEY CAN GET THAT G. D. ACCOMPLISHED AND THEN GET INTO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM IF PERHAPS TRY TO GET A BE A WHICH IS THE YOU KNOW THE GREATEST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR LONG. TERM SUCCESS IT'S SIMPLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN FORTY EIGHT MONTHS I MEET CLIENTS ALL THE TIME WHO COME TO ME AND SAY WOW -- I'M SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR AWAY FROM COMPLETING MY COURSE WORK HERE. BUT I JUST GOT MY LETTER FROM THE COUNTY AND I'M I'M HIT MY FORTY EIGHT MONTH CLOCK ANIMAL LOSE ALL MY SERVICES IN MY ABILITY TO COMPLETE MY PER WHAT CAN I DO. HI I DON'T HAVE A VERY GOOD ANSWER FOR THAT IT'S IT'S SIMPLY AN IMPEDIMENT RIGHT NOW TO PERSONS BEEN ABLE -- TO OBTAIN THE EDUCATION THAT WE KNOW THAT WILL BENEFIT THEM THE GREATEST IN THE LONG TERM. AND THEN WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY FAMILIES HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN THEIR LIVES -- OUR CLIENTS PATHS THROUGH WELFARE TO WORK IS NOT ALWAYS A STRAIGHT LINE -- THEIR POOR A LOT OF THINGS OCCURRED TO THEM THAT. MANY OF US DON'T GO THROUGH ON A DAILY BASIS HAVING THEIR CAR BREAK DOWN I'M NOT HAVING CHILD CARE -- HAVING A CHILD WHO'S STRUGGLING IN SCHOOL ARE STRUGGLING IN THE COMMUNITY WHICH REQUIRES THAT THEIR ATTENTION AS A PARENT ARE ALL THINGS THAT CAN SLOW DOWN THE PATH OF A RECIPIENT. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE SEE MANY MANY FAMILIES AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO AS WELL VERSED IN THE SUBJECT MATTER WE SEE SO MANY FAMILIES WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EITHER IN THE PAST OR CURRENTLY -- AND THESE -- UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY OUR STATE RULES WORK RIGHT NOW IS YOU CAN'T GET A WAIVER -- FROM WELFARE TO WORK REQUIREMENTS IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE UNLESS YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE GOOD CAUSE FOR NOT PARTICIPATING IN WELFARE TO WORK. SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT MEANS THE PEOPLE END UP RUNNING THEIR TIME CLOCKS TRYING. TO MEET THE COUNTIES YOU KNOW WELFARE TO WORK PLAN THAT THERE THE COUNTY IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE IN THE MEANTIME THOSE MONTHS ARE ARE PASSING OFF THEIR CLOCKS. SO FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE ARE ADVOCATING WE WOULD ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE A RETURN TO THE SIXTY MONTHCLOCK. ON THE WOMEN NATION OF THE SECOND TWENTY FOUR MONTHS FEDERAL TIME CLOCK HOW THE ENTIRE SIXTY MONTHS BE DONE -- UNDER THE THE TERMS OF THE SB TEN FORTY ONE FLEXIBLE WELFARE TO WORK APPROACH AND THE MAKE OTHER CONFORMING CHANGES THAT WE DID DURING THE TIME. THAT WE MADE THESE CHANGES TEST BE TEN FORTY ONE TO RESTORE THE PROGRAM TO WHERE IT WAS PRIOR TO THOSE CHANGES THAT'S OUR REQUEST IN THIS MATTER. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. WITH NIKOLAI NOW. SWITCHED AT CAM JOHNSON SOLDIERS ARE JOHNSON SHOULD. WERE TAG TEAMING HERE. I'LL JUST TURN TO THE QUESTIONS AND ON PAGE FORTY OF YOUR AGENDA AND AT THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT WE ARE AT AT HAPPY PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THE COST ESTIMATES AND AND SO FORTH -- AS AS MR HERALD MENTIONED IN ALL ALL ALL BABIES TRY TO HIT ALL OF THESE AND A AND A STORY HERE AB YES THE RAND REPORT AND THEN A YEAR OR TWO AND THREE REPORTS I DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT AT OR DIFFERENT OUTCOMES FOR THOSE WHO. AT PARTICIPATED IN THAT TWENTY FOUR A MONTH AS FLEXIBLE CLOCK -- THE RAND REPORT THE THE VERY THOROUGH COMPREHENSIVE FOCUS GROUPS WITH COUNTY STAFF WITH PARTICIPANTS WITH STATE STAFF AND OTHER PARTNERS IN DOING THAT AND THE COMPLEXITIES. OF THE TIME CLOCK WE'RE CERTAINLY AT PRESENT THERE -- AND HARD TO TRACK I WILL NOTE THAT -- WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LARGE AND SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF TOWERS PARTICIPANTS AT BEING REMOVED FROM EIGHT AM TO AS A RESULT -- OVER THAT THE FULL COURSE OF THESE AB POLICY CHANGES IN TIME I FEWER THAN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY PARTICIPANTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS BEING REMOVED FROM A DUE TO FAILURE TO MEET THOSE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AT THE TWENTY FOUR MONTH TIME CLOCK FLEXIBILITY -- WE ALSO HAVEN'T SEEN THOUGH THE EXTENT WE THAT WE ARE OFFERED EXTENSIONS SO FOR THE COUNTIES HAD EXTENSIONS THAT THEY COULD USE TO SUPPORT -- PARTICIPANTS AND HAVING MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AND WE HAVE AN ALSO SEEN MANY OF THOSE EXTENSIONS USE AGAIN MANY MANY OF THE PARTICIPANTS HAVE MAYBE. ZERO AT ZERO MONTHS AT TICKED. ON THAT TIME CLOCK -- AND THAT'S DUE TO THAT THE MANY EXEMPTIONS AFTER COUNTING IT ADD GOING FORWARD. IN TERMS OF CAL OR IN WHAT WILL KNOW WE WILL CERTAINLY AS MYSTICAL I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WILL KNOW ABOUT EARNINGS OVER TIME AND SO -- THROUGH THE COURSE AN EVOLUTION OF A PARTICIPANT MOVING TO THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM EVEN POST FOR THOSE WHO HAVE EARNINGS WE WILL KNOW EARNINGS OVER TIME SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE KNOW WHAT EARNINGS WERE. AT EXIT AND TWO QUARTERS POST AT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WE COULD TELL -- IF IF HAVING MORE TIME ON AID AND ASSISTANCE WOULD -- YIELDS ADD DIFFERENT EARNING LEVELS OVER TIME. IN TERMS OF AGAIN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE CASE LOAD NOW IN SPECIFICALLY SANCTIONED -- THIS CERTAINLY WAS PART OF OUR CONVERSATION IN A SINGLE LOCATION STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS WE KNOW THAT THE CASELOAD IS -- COMPRISED OF MANY MORE THAT HAVE NEED INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT AND HAVE MORE BARRIERS TO WORK -- THE THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN READY TO WORK IN AND READY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WORK FORCE HAVE DONE SO IN THOSE THAT ARE STILL PARTICIPATING DO YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL. NEEDS -- TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO GET THEM ENGAGED IN WORK SO WE DO NEED THAT INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT AND THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NEEDED -- OUR MOST CURRENT NUMBERS WE HAVE -- A LITTLE OVER FIFTY SIX THOUSAND AB PARTICIPANTS IT AT OF TOTAL SANCTIONED IN THE COW WORKS AT CASELOAD -- AND THE AVERAGE TIME ON AID FOR SANCTION CASE IS NOT IN THE LONG TERM SANCTION WHICH IS OVER TWELVE MONTHS. IS ABOUT NINE AND A HALF MONTHS -- ON AVERAGE SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CASE LOAD AT CAL OR COMING AND AGAIN I WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF THE TWENTY FOUR MONTH TIME CLOCK. THANK YOU FOR WILL FIND. THE DEPARTMENT FINANCED HER WORDS OKAY AT THIS TIME. SIMILARLY OUR OFFICE HAS NO SPECIFIC COMMENT ON THE PROPOSAL ON ONE THING WE WOULD POINT OUT IS THAT. THIS PROPOSAL - THE GRANT DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD TO SORT OF START THE HEARING -- AS WELL AS THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD. THERE ARE A SUITE OF POLICY LEVERS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. CAN EVALUATE WHEN THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MOVE FOR WITH CAL WORKS BUT CRITICS. TO THINK ABOUT THEM IN CONJUNCTION -- THEY ARE OPTIONS MANY OF THEM HAVE FISCAL COST TO THEM SAID ALSO BEAR BEAR THOSE ISSUES IN MIND BUT IT IT REALLY. WILL DEPEND ON HOW THE SUBCOMMITTEE SERVICE SEIZE THE PATH FOR FOR THE PROGRAM. I THINK THAT THE EFFORT TO GET US BACK TO THIS SIXTY MONTHS IS. IS AN IMPORTANT -- IMPORTANT EFFORT -- WE KNOW THAT THE THE ISSUE THE IDEA. IS CLEAR. IT'S THE COST THAT IS A CLEAR. SO AS WE DO EVALUATE AND DO YOUR COM WHICH IS. BOTH YOUR PARENTS ARE WELL TAKEN THAT. OF THAT IS ONE OF THE THE THE THE AREAS THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING TO IS. IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COST IS GOING TO BE. FOR THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE -- TO MY COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] VERY GOOD. NOT THAT IT'S GOOD THANK YOU. ALL RIGHTS LET'S GO TO ISSUE NUMBER. SIX STAGE. ONE CHILD CARE. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON. WELCOME JENNIFER GRAVITY YES HI MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MADAM CHAIR -- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS JENNIFER CRAPPIE AND I'M HERE WITH PARA VOICES CALIFORNIA TO DISCUSS THE STRONG START FOR CAL WORKS FAMILIES BUDGET ASK -- VOICES CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH THE CHILD CARE LAWCENTER. SEIU UT W. AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NETWORK. ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF FAMILIES MACAU WORKS PROGRAM TO GET THE EARLY CONTINUOUS. CHILD CARE THAT THEY NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR FAMILIES PROSPECTS. KNOWING THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE SAFE AND CARED FOR SO THAT THEY CAN COMPLETE PROGRAM ACTIVITIES AND MEET. THERE CAO WORKS OBLIGATION. THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN SO KEY AND IMPROVING THE COW WORKS PROGRAM. INCLUDING REPEALING THE MAXIMUM FAMILY GRANT. STARTING. TO THE PLAN TO LIFT A CASH GRANTS AND KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF THE POVERTY. AND WE REALLY SEE THIS BUDGET ASK AS THE NEXT STEP TO A LONG. TERM. SOLUTION FOR FAMILIES. THIS BUDGET INITIATIVE WAS STREAMLINED STAGE ONE ELIGIBILITY RULES. SO THAT ALL CAO WORKS FAMILIES ARE AFFORDED THE STABLE RELIABLE AND CONSISTENT CHILD CARE THEY NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR FAMILY'S SUCCESS. AND ALIGNS THE STAGE ONE RULES GOVERNING TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY TO THAT EVERY OTHER SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. GIVING A STRONG START TO CLOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS BEFORE THEY START. PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME CHILDREN OF COLOR. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IMPLEMENTS THE TOP RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE COW WORK STAGE ONE PROGRAM. IDENTIFIED BY THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY LEARNING. THE LIFTING CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE A ON THE INTER AGENCY TASK FORCE ON CAL WORKS CHILD CARE -- VOICES RECENTLY CONDUCTED FOR FOCUS GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE TO INFORM THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION REPORT AND HEARD COUNTLESS STORIES OF FAMILIES FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. OF THE COW WORKS CHILD CARE PROGRAM. IT'S PERRANCE LIKE BELL YOUR FROM FRESNO COUNTY WHO LOST HER CHILD CARE DURING THE PLAN TRANSITION BETWEEN STAGES. AND WAS FORCED TO RETURN TO CASH. EIGHT DUE TO UNSTABLE CHILD CARE. OR PARENTS LIKE SYLVIA FROM HAYWARD WHO NEVER RECEIVED CHILD CARE WHILE SHE WAS ON CACHET AND HAD NO IDEA THAT SHE WAS ELIGIBLE FOR CHILD CARE WHEN SHE STARTED WORKING. KATIE FROM SOLANO WHO HAD TO GET NINE DIFFERENT AUTHORIZATIONS FOR CHILDCARE IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME EASY SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS. AND WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS BY. PROVIDING EARLY DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY WITH TWELVE MONTHS -- AUTHORIZATION FROM DAY. ONE ONCE DETERMINED ELIGIBLE FOR CHILD CARE. CHILDREN CAN STAY IN STABLE CONTINUOUS CARE -- EVEN IF HOURS OF ACTIVITY CHANGE OR UNLESS THEIR INCOME GOES ABOVE 85% OR IN TAYLOR TRANSFERRED TO STAGE -- TWO IT WOULD END THE PRACTICE OF SHORT TERM AUTHORIZATIONS THAT ARE TIED TO ACTIVITIES. TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY BUT ALSO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE VERY LOW UPTAKE IN STAGE ONE CHILD CARE. THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE OF LESS THAN 30% OF FAMILIES IN A WELFARE TO WORK ACTIVITY. AND WITH AN AGE ELIGIBLE CHILD. REFERENCED IN YOUR HEARING MATERIALS ON PAGE. FORTY TWO CHILD CARE IS OFF OFFERED AT AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED TO PARTICIPANTS IN ANY PROGRAM ACTIVITY THAT ALLOWS THE FAMILY TO MOVE FORWARD. AND OUT OF CRISIS AND TOWARD STABILITY. THERE ARE MANY TIMES WHEN FAMILIES HAVE BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED PRIOR TO MOVING IT TO SCHOOL OR WORK. SUCH AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MENTAL HEALTH OR HOMELESS AND HOUSING SUPPORT. THE THIRD ELEMENT WOULD CREATE AN ONLINE READ ONLY SUMMARY SCREEN THAT CHILD CARE AGENCIES AND COUNTY WELFARE OFFICES CAN USE TO STREAMLINE. TRANSFERRING CLIENTS FROM STAGE ONE TO STAGE TO CHILD CARE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. THE SCREEN WOULD PROVIDE THE NINE DATA ELEMENTS NEEDED TO ENROLL THE FAMILY INTO STAGE. TWO AND IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE THE LAST STATE OF CASH SHE'D RECEIVED. THIS FIX WAS CONCEIVED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH C. W. D. A.'S CHILD CARE SUBCOMMITTEE. AND THE FOURTH PROPOSAL THAT CAME FROM ONE OF OUR MEMBERS IS TO PROVIDE FORMALLY AIDED FAMILIES WITH ONE NEW NOTICE AT THE EIGHTEENTH MONTH AFTER CASH EIGHT STOPS. THIS NOTICE WILL MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES KNOW THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CHILD CARE SERVICES FOR TWENTY FOUR MONTHS BECAUSE POST CASH AID. AT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PRESS CONFERENCE WHEN SPEAKING ABOUT DEEP CHILD POVERTY AND THE COW WORKS PROGRAM. GOVERNOR NEW SOME DECLARED I'M SICK OF THIS SCAPEGOATING OF THIS PROGRAM. WE COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH THE GOVERNOR. INSTEAD OF BLAMING MOTHERS FOR NOT SUCCEEDING IN THIS PROGRAM. IT'S TIME THAT WE MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SYSTEM THAT SET THESE FAMILIES UP FOR SUCCESS AND FILL THE CRACKS THEY KEEP FALLING THROUGH. WE NEED TO START DISRUPTING POVERTY AND STOP DISRUPTING CHILD CARE AND SUPPORT ACCORDING THIS PROPOSAL WILL DO JUST THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE POWERFUL LAST SENTENCE. THANK YOU YES. THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE HIM JOHNSON SOCIAL SERVICES AND I JUST WANT TO SAY AT BOTH THINK -- SCRAPPY AND IMPAIR INVOICES IS BEEN A PARTNER WITH US -- IN OUR CAL OR STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUPS AND SUPPORTING PARENTS AND CURRENT AND FORMER PARTICIPANTS IN THAT PROCESS AS WELL AS IN THE COW WORKS AT CHUCKY INTERAGENCY GROUP THAT SHE MENTIONED. THAT WE COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT CHILD CARE IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR TOWERS PARTICIPANTS -- IN ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS IN YOUR AGENDA HERE ON PAGE TWENTY FOUR I THINK THE FIRST ONE IS FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED ON PAGE FORTY THREE AND AND LET YOU KNOW WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AND AVAILABLE AND WHAT ISN'T SO. I'LL DO THAT AND I I WANT TO JUST MENTION -- WHILE THE AGENDA ALSO INCLUDES THE PARTICIPATION RATE. ARE THE CAO EXPERTISE OPINION STAGE ONE BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WERE REMEMBERING THAT AND THAT'S THE FIRST DATA SET COMPONENT HERE THAT. A COW WORKS FAMILY HAS ACCESS TO A NUMBER OF CHILDCARE SUBSIDIES ABOVE AND BE ON STAGE. ONE AND SO WE DO SEE OUR CAO EXPERTISE OFFENSE ABBOTT DISSIPATING IN STATE PRESCHOOL GENERAL CHILD CARE ALTERNATE PAYMENT PER. MENTIONS ABOUT MIGRANT ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAMS OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION MINISTERS AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STAGE ONE THE UTILIZATION AND YOU LOOK AT THREE AT PARTICIPATION IN THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS AT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION MINISTERS. WERE CLOSER TO ABOUT 59% OF THE POWER EXPERTISE DEPENDS AB PARTICIPATING IN SOME FORM OF STATE CHILDCARE SUBSIDY ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND THAT STILL AT A KIND OF MINIMUM THRESHOLD BECAUSE AT CAO EXPERTISE DEPENDS ARE CATEGORICALLY EDGE ELIGIBLE FOR HEAD START EARLY HEAD START -- AND THAT'S ALSO A PLACE WHERE FANS HAVE GROWN OVER TIME SO WE HAVE MORE OFFERINGS IN EARLY HEAD START HEAD START THAN WE HAVE TYPICALLY WITH NEW FUSION OF DOLLARS THERE. SO -- THERE'S ALSO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND LOCAL SUBSIDY PROGRAM SO WE DO -- WANT TO INSURE THAT WERE SPEAKING ABOUT. THE FACT THAT THE COUCH PARTICIPANTS HAVE HAVE A CHOICE -- IN SELECTING THOSE AND SO AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHERE THERE IS DATA AVAILABLE THAT UTILIZATION RATE IS CLOSER 260%.

AND WILL BE ABLE TO BE ACCEPTABLE POSTED ONLINE FOR ANYONE TO ACCESS IN TERMS OF GETTING A A RICHER PICTURE.

SOME OF THESE OTHER WILL REQUIRE -- WHAT WE CALL AT A SEARCH PRESENT AND PLEASE DON'T ASK ME TO TELL YOU IT THAT SEE? MORE AT THE MOMENT BUT BASICALLY IT'S IT'S WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC DAY THAT COMPONENT AVAILABLE WE ASK THE SIZE THE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEMS. TO AS TAKE SOME SAMPLE DATA AND AND IN A FIVE AT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT -- THE COW WORKS OUT COMES ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOOK MORE GRANULAR ACCESS AT SOME OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS BY EACH OF THE PROGRAMS THAT AT PARTICIPANT AS ADAM PARTICIPATING AND SO THAT WAS ANOTHER. OPPORTUNITY WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS MORE SPECIFICALLY -- THROUGH CAL OR IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM WE WOULD ALSO THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING IT'S CLEARLY IN STATUTE THAT BE CAO WORKS CHILDCARE STAGES WERE INTENDED TO BE SEAMLESS SYSTEMS WE RECOGNIZE THAT STAGES TWO AND THREE DO YOU HAVE -- THE POLICY THAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED DO DEPARTMENT DUCATION SO WHERE THE LEAK HOW WORK STAGE ONE WAS INTENDED TO BE THE SHORTEST TERM OF THOSE AT THREE STAGES BUT TO THINK ABOUT -- SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES AB DESTRUCTION TO CHILD CARE AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR FAMILIES AS THEY ENTERED THE CARRIAGE PROGRAM WE ALSO. AGREE IS IMPORTANT TO DO -- SO I THINK I HAVE COVERED THE QUESTIONS THERE ON THE AGENDA THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HER WITH NO COMMENT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE REPORT -- THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER BY PARENTS FORCES CALIFORNIA. I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT BODY OF WORK THAT WAS DONE AFTER. MUCH MUCH RESEARCH AND INTERVIEWING JUST AS USE YOU STATED -- THE SPEAKERS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ALSO -- ANOTHER REPORT AND I THINK ALL THESE RICH EXTREMELY PART AND THEY ALL POINT TO THE SAME THING WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN AND PROVIDE THAT CHILD CARE -- AS AN ASIDE NOT RELATED DIRECTLY TO THIS SO I CAN MENTION IT -- I I I AM SPONSORING A BILL I'M OFFERING A BILL AB ONE NINETY FOUR SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDE A BILLION DOLLARS. OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. FOR CHILD CARE FOR MORE CHILD CARE SLOTS. BECAUSE WE ALL RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS. BUT I THINK YOU FOR PRESENTING THIS I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A DOLLAR AMOUNT WE DON'T KNOW THE COST. AND JUST AS WITH THE THE ONE JUST BEFORE -- THOSE ARE THE THINGS ARE WORKING ON AND I KNOW THAT -- YOU. YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL THAT IS BEING DONE AND I IDEALLY AYE AYE I'M SURE THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH DSS AND DO DEPARTMENT FINANCE. FLUENTLY ACTS THEY BEEN AMAZING PARTNERS -- THERE'S IS THAT WONDERFUL. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. I'M SORRY ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] TERRIBLE. ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER. SEVEN ON THE ASSET TEST MS BARTOLO. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST GIVE ARTS OVER THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY I'M ALSO THE STEERING COMMITTEE CHAIRPERSON OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSET BUILDING COALITIONS SO I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT TODAY THE ADVOCATES. PROPOSAL -- SUBMITTED BY WESTERN CENTER AND BASS ABILITY COALITION ALONG WITH EARNED PROSPERITY NOW AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS AND SEE SEE DEBBIE RO. TO REQUEST THAT THE ASSET TEST FOR THE COUCH PROGRAM BE ELIMINATED. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES AT THAT COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY TO DENIED AN APPLICANT -- CAL ASSISTANCE IF THEY HAVE MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IN THE BANK OR AN AUTO WORTH MORE THAN NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE AUTO RESOURCE TEST WAS IS PART OF THE CAL THE ASSET TEST ITSELF THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN ADJUSTED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN THE BUDGET. AND IT ALSO HAS A COST OF LIVING INCREASE -- THE ASSET TEST WHICH MEANS THAT EVERY YEAR THAT THAT CALIFORNIA HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT AND THE AND THE AND THE COUNTIES HAVE. TO ADJUSTED. SO YOU MIGHT ASK YOURSELF WELL HOW MANY CAO WORKS RECIPIENTS CAN ACTUALLY SAVE THIS MUCH MONEY YOU JUST HEARD. HOW LITTLE PEOPLE HAVE TO LIVE ON IN THE TOWERS PROGRAM EVEN AFTER THE LARGEST INCREASE IN THEIR GRANTS -- IN OVER A DECADE TWO DECADES -- JUST HAPPENING THIS MONTH WHICH HURT AGAIN THRILLED AT THRILLED ABOUT -- IT AS YOU HEARD ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO SAY THERE'S STILL A TOO LITTLE TO IMAGINE LIVING OFF OF AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS. THAT RECIPIENTS A CAL WORKS ARE NOT SAVING MONEY AND THEY'RE BARELY GETTING BY -- BUT WHAT THIS ASSET TEST DOES IS IT KEEPS PEOPLE IT PRESENTS A VERY FOR PEOPLE APPLYING FOR BENEFITS -- AND IT'S NOT A PERMANENT THERE BY THE WAY WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WHEN FAMILIES COME IN AND APPLY FOR BENEFITS IF THEY HAVE ASSETS LET'S SAY THEY'VE LOST A JOB -- THEY HAD A KNEE INJURY OR DEATH IN THE FAMILY A FAMILY SEPARATION OR SOME OTHER LIFE CHANGING EVENT AND THEY COME IN TO APPLY FOR BENEFITS TO HELP PAY THE RENT AND THE BASIC NEEDS. WHEN THEY GET THERE -- THEY LEARN ABOUT THE ASSET TEST AND AND WHAT THEY REALIZE IS IF THEY JUST GO HOME. AND SPEND DOWN THEIR ASSETS IF THEY'RE STILL POOR THEY CAN COME BACK IN AND APPLY IN FACT YOU SEE A KIND OF TURNING OF APPLICANTS -- PEOPLE COME IN A MAY HAVE JUST OVER THAT THE SAVINGS AMOUNT WHICH THAT THEY'VE THEY'VE WORKED REALLY HARD TO SAY. MANY PEOPLE HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS TO SAVE A THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN TO BE TOLD THAT THEY HAVE TO SPEND THAT DOWN IN ORDER TO GET A LITTLE HELP WITH THE RENT -- IS. IT'S NOT A GOOD WAY TO START THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY -- FOR THE CALIBER CHARACTER APPLICANTS -- RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE IN SOME OF THE OTHER STATES WHERE THIS IS A REPEAL HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED LIKE ALABAMA AND LOUISIANA -- HAS SHOWN THAT LESS THAN 1% OF THE THE APPLICANT'S OF ACTUALLY HAD ASSETS OVER THIS AMOUNT -- AND SO BUT BUT THE TEST HAS TO BE APPLIED TO EVERY APPLICANT. SO IT'S ALSO BURDEN FOR THE APPLICANTS AND THE WORKERS -- IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT YOU HAVE -- ASSET BELOW THAT AMOUNT. 99% OF THE APPLICANTS AGAIN WITH ASSETS BELOW THIS AMOUNT THEY STILL HAVE TO GET A PRINT OUT OF THEIR LAST THREE MONTHS OF A BANK ACCOUNT. THE ONES THAT ARE CHALLENGE THE MOST TO DO THIS ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES THAT DON'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT. THEN THEY HAVE TO PROVE THEY DON'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY HARD TO DO IF YOU'VE EVER PROVEN YOU DON'T HAVE A SOMETHING -- THEY SAY WHAT DO YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO I PROVE I DON'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT -- SO WE END UP ASKING A INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BANK ACCOUNT AND SUBMIT IT. IF THEY IF THEY DON'T HAVE AS THE THEIR BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION MAILED TO THEM THEY THEY MAY HAVE AN ONLINE THEY LACK INTERNET ACCESS TO HAVE TO GO TO A PRINTER. IT'S IT CAN BE QUITE BURDEN SOME AND THEN EACH ONE OF THE APPLICATION IS AT THE PEOPLE UPSET ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS THE CASE WORKERS ALSO HAVE TO REVIEW. THE THE INFORMATION FOR A 100% OF THE CASES WHEN LESS THAN 1% OF THE CASES ARE TONIGHT SO. I'M FOR BOTH EFFICIENCIES SO THAT WE CAN -- FREE UP THE TIME OF THE SOCIAL WORKERS SO THEY CAN HELP PEOPLE FIND HOUSING THEY CAN HELP PEOPLE FIND WORK THEY CAN REMOVE BARRIERS -- AND SUPPORT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS -- THERE'S SO MUCH TO THE CASE WORKERS AT THE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES COULD BE DOING THAT BETTER SUPPORT FAMILIES IN TRANSITION I'M FROM POVERTY AN OUT OF POVERTY -- AND THEN TO TO LOOK FOR PEOPLE'S BANK ACCOUNTS WHICH 99% OF THE TIME SAY THEY HAVE NOTHING. WITH THAT SAID IT YOU KNOW JUST A KIND OF AN CLOSING -- ASSETS AND EARNINGS THESE TWO THINGS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT IF WE THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE HELP FAMILIES EXIT POVERTY RIGHT MOST OF OF OF THE COUCH PROGRAM IT'S EITHER. PREVENTING HARM TO FAMILIES WHILE THEY ARE LIVING IN POVERTY. OR HELPING THEM EXCEPT POVERTY. AND AND I RAIL I REALIZE THAT THE ASSET -- THIS THIS PANEL IS DIFFERENT THAN THE EARNINGS PANEL BUT THEY REALLY DO BELONG TOGETHER IN A SINGLE KIND OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THE PROGRAM. HAS A CORE INTERESTS TO HELP PEOPLE EXCEPT POVERTY IN TO DO THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT EARNINGS. AND ASSETS -- AND WITH THAT I'LL GO AHEAD AND CLOSE AND A A STATE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. LIKE SPEAKER. THANK YOU NATASHA BECAUSE CDSS -- WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE STATE DOES RECOGNIZE THAT INCREASING ABSOLUTE ASSET THRESHOLDS TO SOME POINT MAY DECREASE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FOR COUNTIES AND ALSO ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE WORKING SAVING BEHAVIOR -- THAT ALLOW FOR HOUSING IN LIFE STABILITY AN UNEXPECTED TIMES OF HARDSHIP -- THAT SAID THE STATE DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE PROPOSAL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THE COLLEAGUES. ON THIS PARTICULAR ONE I I I WOULD ASK -- STE ALAMO FROM THE LA -- IT WOULD WE DO NEED TO GET. WITH. THE COST PROPOSAL. AND I WOULD ASK. YOU REALLY HELP US WITH THIS PARTICULAR REQUEST. I THINK IF WE HAVE THE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS -- AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE SAVING ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND WE'RE NO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- IF WE IF WE CAN GET A COST AND IF IF YOU COULD. HELP US WITH THIS REQUEST ARE WE WOULD SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT WOULD BE HAPPY. TO I ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES -- I I THOUGHT HE'D BE HERE -- HIS IS SHARED THAT. HE SAYS WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE. TO THE SHAME TO SO MUCH BEFORE THEY CAN GAIN ENTRY INTO THE SERVICES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE TO THEM. AND I THINK YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB OF TELLING US JUST THAT. THANK YOU YES DOCTOR WOULD. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT THIS THIS REMINDS ME OF A LITTLE BIT OF A BILL I'M WORKING ON RIGHT NOT RIGHT NOW RELATING TO FLIPPING ON AND OFF OF THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM -- THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OF PEOPLE'S OWN AND AND SO THESE ARE THESE ARE REALLY REALLY FRUSTRATING -BLEMS THAT THE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE VULNERABLE AND CREATE TREMENDOUS CONFUSION AND IT JUST DOESN'T NEED TO BE THAT WAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRING THIS FORWARD. I DO THINK IT'S THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD AND I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO POINT OUT THAT THIS WOULD ALIGN ITSELF OF WE MADE THIS CHANGE IT WOULD ALIGN ITSELF WITH THE CAL FRESH POLICY -- AND WITH MEDI CAL FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN SO IT WOULD BE ADMINISTRATIVELY MORE EFFICIENT THAT WAY AS WELL. THIS REVIEW JUST A QUICK QUESTION HOW DO YOU PROVE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT. A LOT OF THINGS YOU HAVE TO PROVE YOU DON'T HAVE WE JUST SELL THEM TO SAY THEY DON'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT -- BUT IF THEY HAD A CLOSER OF THE BANK ACCOUNT SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE BANK ACCOUNTS THIS IS THAT THEY HAVE. A DEFICIT IN THE ACCOUNT -- SO MAYBE SHOW THAT -- AND AND YEAH IT IS COMPLICATED -- WE WE JUST TELL THEM TO SAY THEY DON'T HAVE ONE AND AND A SWEAR IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER. AND THAT BUT THEN BUT THEN THE COUNTY HAS TO GO LOOKING RIGHT INTO THE COUNTY CAN'T STOP THERE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY MORE COMPLICATED THE COUNTY HAS A THAN GO LOOKING THROUGH THE THE DATABASE IS FULL OF OF OF INFORMATION. WOW. THANK YOU. I JOIN IN -- DOCTOR WOULDN'T THANKING YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. AND THE LAST ISSUE ON CAL WORKS ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT ON HOMELESSNESS IS THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. MR HURLED WILL BEGIN WITH YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND BACK AGAIN. AND THE THE WORD THAT YOU HAD USED WAS POWERFUL INTERESTS I JUST COULD NOT -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR FINDING THE OF THAT WORD HE WAS NOT TO HIGH PAID LOBBYISTS THAT WAS NOT THE WORD YOU USED. YOU TALKED ABOUT POWERFUL INTERESTS. THANK YOU FOR BEING THAT POWERFUL INTEREST BECAUSE YOU ALL ARE POWERFUL HERE FOR US. FOR HOPEFULLY THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU -- YOUR YOUR CONSULTANT IS EVER EFFICIENT -- HOPEFULLY I THIS WILL BE A SOMEWHAT LESS ELONGATED THAN SOME OF MY OTHER PRESENTATIONS TODAY -- BUT I WANTED TO BRING FORTH TO YOU AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE FOR MANY YEARS NOW -- AND WE ARE AGAIN. BRING FORTH A PROPOSAL RELATED TO THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM I'M FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE AGAIN THAT -- GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS -- COME FORTH WITH A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS AROUND ADDRESSING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS THAT EXISTS IN OUR STATE HAS A VERY AMBITIOUS PLAN FOR TRYING TO BILL THREE POINT FIVE MILLION UNITS -- THE LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY IS FULLY ENGAGE WITH THIS ISSUE WITH THE GOVERNOR AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT PACKAGE OF BILLS AND LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PROPOSALS I SHOULD SAY. THAT WILL BE COMING FORTH THIS YEAR AND TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS OUR TO FURTHER ADDRESS THE ISSUES AROUND HOUSING. UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH FOR OUR CLIENTS I MEAN I USED TO BE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATE IN A PRIOR JOB. AND I I KNOW THAT THE TIMELINE FOR BRINGING THOSE UNITS ONLINE IS GOING TO TAKE. SEVERAL YEARS -- UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW OUR CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH HOMELESSNESS TODAY -- AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AND OBVIOUSLY OF WITH THE INCREASE IN THE GRANT LEVELS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING WE DO THINK THAT THAT WILL ASSIST IN TRYING TO ALLOW SOME FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR HOUSING MORE. BUT INCREASINGLY THE GULF BETWEEN WHAT OUR TOWERS FAMILIES MAKE. LIVING AS MR AS LAINEY NOTED EARLIER THE AVERAGE GRANT OF LOOK JUST 38% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL RIGHT NOW -- AND THE COST OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA THE GOAL IS JUST SO EXTREME THAT WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING TO COUNTY OFFICES ASKING FOR HELP WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE EITHER THROUGH THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM. FAMILY STABILIZATION OR THE LONG STANDING PROGRAM CALLED THE HOUSING -- THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM -- ONE BERRIER THOUGH THE IN THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET CHANGE FOR MANY YEARS. IS -- THE CURRENT LAW -- WE PERMITS THAT WE PROVIDE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE -- FOR UP TO SIXTEEN DAYS -- BUT THE WAY THE CURRENT POLICY WORKS IS THAT. IF YOU IF A FAMILY COMES IN AND THEY GET SIXTEEN DAYS OF TEMPORARY HOUSING ASSISTANCE. BUT TURNS OUT THAT THEY ONLY NEED SEVEN DAYS THEY FIND HOUSING WITHIN SEVEN DAYS. THEY EFFECTIVELY THE WAY TO KEEP THE STATE COUNTS IT IS THEY'VE USED UP THEIR ENTIRE SIXTEEN DAYS. AND SO -- OUR PROPOSAL IS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE WE THINK SEVEN DAYS SHOULD BE SEVEN DAYS AND THAT WOULD AND THAT WOULD MEAN THAT A FAMILY COULD COME BACK IF THEY HAD ANOTHER EPISODE HOMELESSNESS DURING THAT SAME YEAR. COULD COME BACK TO THE PROGRAM AND GET ADDITIONAL NINE DAYS THAT THEY COULD USE TOWARDS. FINDING HOUSING ASSISTANCE -- SEARCHING FOR HOUSING ASSISTANCE WHILE WE GOT TEMPORARY HOUSING. REALLY THAT'S THE SUM AND SUBSTANCE OF OUR PROPOSAL -- THIS IS -- BEEN PROPOSING A BILL BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MAIENSCHEIN ACTUALLY SAT IT IN PRIOR YEARS ANY AGAIN HAS IT THIS YEAR AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS WILL BE THE YEAR THAT THIS IS THIS LANGUAGE STICKS IN THE BUDGET. AND WE MAKE THIS SIMPLE CHANGED WHAT WE THINK IS BEEN A LONG TERM PROBLEM. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEXT SPEAKER HI I SAID IN OUR HOUSING ASSISTANCE ALL RIGHTS BRANCH CHIEF AT CSS. AND SO WE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THAT THE SIXTEEN DAYS OF EMERGENCY SHELTER PROVIDED BY TEMPORARY HOME WITH ASSISTANCE IS REALLY CRUCIAL -- FOOD TO ALMOST FAMILIES RECEIVING CAL WORKS WE ARE ALSO REALLY AWARE THAT THOSE BENEFITS IN AND OF ITSELF DOES NOT SOLVE SOMEONE'S HOMELESS CRISIS -- AND THAT WE HAVE REALLY ENCOURAGE IT CSS TO ENSURE THAT WERE BREEDING THESE FUNDING STREAMS -- THIS HA BEING SORT OF THE STOP GAP EMERGENCY SERVICES -- RATING THAT WITH OUR HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM OUR FAMILY STABILISATION PROGRAM OR CONTINUALLY AS WE'RE SEEING MORE STATE FUNDING THROUGH OTHER. CONTINUUM OF CARE FUNDING STREAMS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TO REALLY ENSURE THAT WE ARE STABILIZING FAMILY BEYOND SORT OF AN EMERGENCY MOTELS AFTER. AND SO WE'RE NOTING THAT WHILE YOU KNOW. THERE IS MUCH TO BE DONE AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS THIS EMERGENCY SHELTER PIECE IT JUST BE ALSO ALLOWS -- AND BECAUSE EVEN IN SIXTEEN DAYS IF YOU'RE USING THE FULL SIXTEEN DAYS IT'S OFTEN TAKING IN THIS MARKET MUCH LONGER THAN SIXTEEN DAYS TO FIND YOUR NEXT. NEXT UNIT AND SO WE'RE STOP GAPPING THAT WAS NUMBER OF THERE ARE OTHER FUNDING STREAMS RIGHT NOW -- INCLUDING NOT JUST SORT OF FOR AGES P. IN PARTICULAR NOT JUST A RENTAL SUBSIDY BUT THAT INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT THAT REALLY IS REQUIRED TO HELP SOMEONE FIND THEIR NEXT UNIT. SO JUST OF NOTING THAT THE BREEDING OF ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AS WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT TODAY WITH ALL THESE CAL WORKS -- PIECES IS REALLY A KEY PIECE TO KEEP AN IN MIND -- AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT PER YEAR YOUR QUESTIONS IN IT AND MY CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG HERE I THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL'S A BIT MORE THAN JUST THE SIXTEEN DAYS THING THE OTHER ITEMS WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IS IS THE SIXTEEN DAYS PLUS SORT OF TELL. ME IF I'M WRONG -- BUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ALSO ENCOURAGING IT TO TO REMOVE THAT -- ONE YEAR INSTEAD OF ALLOWING FOR ADDITIONAL DAYS BEYOND SIXTEEN BUT I COULD BE SO THEY DIDN'T MENTION OKAY I JUST I DIDN'T WANT IT DIDN'T SORT OF WANT TO GET INTO COSTS IF THAT'S NOT IT SO WE WE HAD LOOKED LAST YEAR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROPOSAL ABOUT. HOW MUCH JUST USING THE FULL SIXTEEN DAYS WOULD COST -- THINK IN SORT OF REPEAT THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LOOK AT SORT OF THE SECOND PIECE OF THIS PROPOSAL WHICH IF YOU WANT. TO CHIME IN ON SO I DON'T SPEAK FOR YOU -- WE THINK WOULD BE QUITE EXPENSIVE -- AND SO WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE BIT A LOOKING INTO THAT AND AND JUST SORT OF REALLY REITERATING THAT THAT THE LONG TERM STABILITY PIECE OF THIS THAT WERE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON BUT WE HAVE NO PROOF WE HAVE NO SORT OF FORMAL. SHE'S THE RIGHT GUY I DID FORGET TO MENTION THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR THE LIMIT ON ONCE A YEAR SYSTEMS -- FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE I'M NOT SUFFERING FROM DOMESTIC AN INCIDENT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BE LIFTED ALSO MY APOLOGIES FOR FOUR MILLION AT THANK YOU LIKE SPEAKER. VERY GOOD -- QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM YES MISS RUBIO -- JUST THE COMMENTS ARE YOU HE SAID THAT -- THE SIXTEEN DAYS WON'T TAKE ANYBODY OUT OF HOMELESSNESS IT WON'T EVEN MAKE A DENT ON JUST YOU KNOW -- SURVIVING REALLY A MONTH ESPECIALLY FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT YOU KNOW IF WE CAN DO. MORE IN A I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO SAY ABOUT THE MONEY AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY WE UNDERSTAND THAT BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE ISSUES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT STAKE. HERE IT'S NOT YOU KNOW SOMETHING ARBITRARY SO. CAN I I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE FOR THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM THAT PROGRAM HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN FUNDING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THERE'S AN EXPECTED INCREASE THIS YEAR. AND NOT REALLY IS MORE ABOUT PROVIDING THE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO FIND SOMEONE A UNIT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT EVEN SIXTEEN DAYS IS REALLY NOT GOING TO GET THEM FULLY STABILIZE AND THAT PROGRAM IS CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND CONTINUES TO SERVE. AND AND HOW IS MORE MORE FAMILIES EVERY YEAR RIGHT AND REALLY NOT FULL AND YEAH BUT NO BUT IT GOES BACK TO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT THAT FEET SOMEBODY FOR OUR GIVE SOMEONE FISH. TEACH MODIFICHE THEN YOU KNOW IF WE CAN PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES I THINK THAT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND THANK YOU FOR THAT BY SAYING. THAT THE FUNDING HAS INCREASED AND IF WE CAN PROVIDE YOU KNOW WRAPAROUND SERVICES AROUND THAT THEN THAT WOULD BE I THINK THE IDEAL SITUATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. MR ELLO -- IF WE WERE TO TAKE JUST THE FIRST PART OF THE PRESENTATION -- AND NOT. LIMITING IT TO SIXTEEN DAYS CONSECUTIVE. BUT I ALLOWING FOR SIXTEEN DAYS ANNUALLY. DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE ON WHAT THE COST WOULD BE. OUR OFFICE HASN'T DONE A SPECIFIC ESTIMATE ON THAT BUT WE WOULD BE HAPPY I BELIEVE THE THE DEPARTMENT DID LOOK AT THIS QUESTION LAST YEAR. WE CAN COORDINATE BOTH OF YOUR STAFF WITH THEM TO TRY TO FACILITATE INVESTMENT IN THE AND THEN. THE SORT OF PROCESS HERE IS THE BUDGET WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

AN EXCLAMATION POINT ON WHY WE NEED -- ISSUE -- SIX BUT I'M REALLY HERE TO TALK ABOUT ISSUE -- ONE THE INCREASING CASH GRANTS WHICH I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT AND IT'S A WONDERFUL THING FOR FAMILIES AND MY DAUGHTER. IS A TEEN MOM AND SHE IS IN THE CAO WORKS PROGRAM CURRENTLY GOING TO SCHOOL. AND SHE WAS SO EXCITED TO GET HER NOTICED THAT SAID YOUR CASH GRAB IS GOING TO BE INCREASED -- AND THEN IN THE SAME LETTER SHE GOT. ANOTHER NOTICE THAT SAID. ACTUALLY NOW WE'RE GOING TO DECREASE YOUR HOW FRESH BENEFITS AND SO THE WASH WAS ABOUT TEN DOLLARS.

YES SIR I JUST HAD A REVELATION CAN I ASK DIAZ SAYS ONE FINAL QUESTION SENSOR YES I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS. SO ONE OF THE THINGS IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME AS WE HAVE. A SITUATION IN THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED -- POPULATION WITH LACK OF PROVIDERS FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE CAN THE CONSUMER. A LOT OF FAMILIES NOW OR HAVING TO DEFAULT AND LEAVE THEIR JOBS. TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN WITH THESE DISABILITIES. DO YOU TRACK -- THIS POPULATION COMING INTO TO OF TO HAVE THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET GOING FORWARD. I MEAN WHAT I'M SAYING IS IF ONE AGENCY -- IS NOT BEING ABLE TO HELP AND AND THERE'S ALSO THE TO THE SYNDROME CALLED THE GATEKEEPER WHERE THEY'RE DENIED SERVICES ALSO. AND PARENTS ARE NOW DO. ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW HAVING TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILD AND BE AN ADVOCATE AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO FIGHT FOR SERVICES. CAN'T WORK IN SPECIALLY SINGLE MOMS. IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TRACK THAT. GOING FORWARD BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT THAT'S A FAILURE. OF OF OF THE COMMITMENT FOR ENTITLEMENT STATE WHERE YOU DON'T THANK GOD WE HAVE A SAFETY NET. BUT ALSO -- MOMS AND DADS WERE SAYING. I CAN'T CONTINUE TO WORK MY CHILD IS NOT BEING PROVIDED. FOR IN AN ENTITLEMENT STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN A STRONG ADVOCATE. IN THAT ENTIRE SPACE. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP. ALL RIGHT THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE NOW [inaudible] TO CALPERS. WAS IT NOLAN CAPS. ALL RIGHT ISSUE NUMBER. NINE I COULD HAVE THE THE PANELISTS COME FORWARD. AND LET'S BEGIN WITH KIM THE COURT WADE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR. ELECTIONS AGAIN OR JUST GO AHEAD AND START WITH CAL FRESH YES OKAY LET'S BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER. NINE WAS THAT YOUR QUESTION. SO I BEGIN. ALRIGHT. BRIEFLY I CANNOT GIVE YOU A QUICK UPDATE ON HOW FRESH -- PROGRAM WE SERVE ABOUT THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION INDIVIDUALS EACH MONTH WITH THE FOOD BENEFIT ON THE EBT CARD. OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FOOD BENEFITS COME INTO THE CONDAMINE SPENT TO GROCERY STORES AND FARMERS MARKETS. CASELOADS ARE DECLINING OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMY THEY TEND TO TRACK UNEMPLOYMENT BUT PARTICIPATION RATES ARE ESTIMATED TO CONTINUE. TO GROW SLOWLY A WE ARE WATCHING CLOSELY THE TRANS TO SEE FOR ANY IMPACT OF THE CLIMATE AROUND IMMIGRATION AND MAKING SURE ALL FOLKS WERE ELIGIBLE ARE STILL WELCOME. WE CONTINUE TO BE COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL OVERSIGHT ON TIMELINESS AND ACCURACY AND ARE EXPANDING OUR ACCESS ONLINE ON THE PHONE. HIGHLIGHTS FROM LAST YEAR WE BEGAN OUT WELL HEADLINES MAYBE NOT HIGHLIGHTS WE BEGAN REIMPOSING THE FEDERAL TIME LIMITS -- KNOWN AS A BOTTOM THREE COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO SANTA CLARA AND SAN MATTEO. SECOND WE HAD UNPRECEDENTED DISASTER RESPONSE PARTICULARLY IN BUTTE COUNTY AND OTHER COUNTIES FACING WILDFIRE PROVIDING FOOD. AND THIRD WE RESPOND TO THE FEDERAL SHUTDOWN TO ISSUING BENEFITS EARLY FEBRUARY BENEFITS EARLY IN JANUARY THEN CONTINUING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE'S BUT THE BENEFITS WEREN'T. INTERRUPTED LOOKING AHEAD THE MAJOR ISSUE WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IS EXPANSION OF CALIFORNIA SO SERVE UP PEOPLE RECEIVING SSI BUT OTHER PRIORITIES CONTINUE TO BE MAKING SURE WE STAY WELCOME TO ALL CALIFORNIANS WERE ELIGIBLE REGARDLESS OF LANGUAGE STATUS OR DISABILITY -- EXPANDING OUR WORK OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING EVEN WHILE IMPOSING TIME LIMITS AND MORE COUNTIES IN CONTINUING -- TO GET IT RIGHT FIRST TIME IMPROVE OUR ACCURACY REDUCE ERRORS OVER ISSUANCES AND HEARINGS THAT'S THE SHORT VERSION FROM CALIBRATION HAPPY TO TAKE TAKE UP THE ISSUES. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THAT -- OVER. LET'S BEGIN WITH THE ABLE BODIED ADULTS WITHOUT DEPENDENCE SURE A BONDS SURE. SO -- FOLLOWING THE QUESTIONS OF THE AGENDA THERE ARE -- SEVERAL -- HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE OUT RECEIVING CAL FOR US WHO WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS TIME LIMIT AS UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO WORK FOR TWENTY HOURS PER WEEK -- THEY WOULD BE CUT OFF OF FOOD AFTER THREE MONTHS -- AND THIRTY SIX MONTH PERIOD. SO THE STATE HAS BEEN WORKING -- TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF THAT -- PARTICULARLY IN OUR FIRST TWO WAVE COUNTIES WERE ABLE TO DO ARE ONE TWO THREE APPROACH AND EXEMPTS PEOPLE AS APPROPRIATE CONNECTED WITH EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BANK OF BENEFITS -- THAT'S WORKING FOR NOW AS WERE IN THREE COUNTIES AND HOPEFULLY SIX COUNTIES AT SOME POINT THAT APPROACH WILL BE EXHAUSTED PARTICULARLY AS THE LARGER COUNTIES IN THE VALLEY IN THE SOUTH MIGHT COME IN WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM. LOSING FOOD ACCESS IN A MATTER OF A YEAR. TO ALSO THE FEDS -- YOU SCA HAS A PROPOSED RULE WERE. WERE WHERE DO YESTERDAY BETTER NOW RE OPENED STILL HAVE TIME TO COMMENT WHICH WOULD RADICALLY CHANGE THE SYSTEM AND WOULD REQUIRE CALIFORNIAN ALL STATES TO BEGIN ON TIME LIMITS AND CEASING. FOOD ASSISTANCE. THE MATTER OF MONTHS AND THAT WOULD IMPACT AGAIN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO FOOD IF THAT RULE WERE TO BECOME FINAL. THAT'S THE CURRENT SITUATION. AND DISINTEREST SECOND QUESTION -- THE THE ALTERNATIVES THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM -- ADVOCATES THE NATIONAL AND STATE LEVEL AUG HAVE TO DO WITH CALIFORNIA CREATING STATE FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO FILL IN THE GAP NOT DISSIMILAR FOR A POST WELFARE REFORM WHEN -- FEDERALLY SNAP MADE REDUCTIONS IN THE LEGALLY PRESENT IMMIGRANTS IT WOULD COVER CALIFORNIA CREATED A CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO COVER THAT GAP INSURER. THOSE IMMIGRANTS CALIFORNIA COULD CHOOSE TO DO SOME OTHER SIMILAR GAP FILLING AROUND THESE GAPS CREATED BY FEDERAL TIME LIMITS. SURE ON EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING. YES. THIS IS A BECAUSE OUR EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES HAVE A NEARLY DOUBLED IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS THESE ARE VOLUNTARY SERVICES AND WE HAVE WORKED TO BRING IN MORE COUNTY SPRING AND MORE WORK FORCE PROVIDERS SERVE MORE PEOPLE. AND IMPORTANTLY NOTCHES TO QUANTITY BUT QUALITY REALLY PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES WORK FOR SPORTS. AND NOW WE ARE MEASURING OUR OUTCOMES ON WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT RATES TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT JUST A SERVICE PROVIDED BUT ACTUALLY -- A BENEFIT CONFERRED -- IN ORDER BECAUSE WE ARE DOING THAT THE OFFENSIVE REQUESTED INCREASED NOT REQUESTED HAVE ARE REQUIRED -- INCREASED OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND SO WE ARE REQUESTING MORE STAFF BUT THAT WILL BE FOR A 100% FUNDED WITH FEDERAL FUNDS THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT FUND THE SERVICES WERE ALSO FUND THE OVERSIGHT WE JUST NEED THE THIRTY TWO TO STAFF APPROPRIATELY AS DIRECTED BY THE FENCE. THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE GREAT. THE MAN CHAIRED JESSICA BARTH LOW WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY HERE TO REQUEST -- THAT WE CREATE A STATE FUNDED BENEFITS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE. LOSING THEIR BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF THE A BAD TIME LIMIT WHICH IS THREE MONTHS. OUT OF A THIRTY SIX MONTH PERIOD. AT THAT THEY NOT GO HUNGRY. AS YOU HEARD AS MISS MCQUAY WADE SPEAK ABOUT THE CURRENT RULE -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A ONE TWO THREE APPROACH THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS WORKED HAND IN HAND WITH COUNTY ADMINISTRATORS AND ADVOCATES TO HELP DEVELOP. OF WERE SATISFIED WITH HOW THAT'S WORKING IN AND BELIEVE THAT WE ARE NOT -- EXACERBATING HUNGER AS A RESULT OF THAT APPROACH AND SO CONGRATULATE THE DEPARTMENT -- WITH SOME REALLY PRETTY GNARLY TIME LINES BEING ABLE TO TO IMPLEMENT. THE RETURN OF OF THE TIME LIMIT. THAT BEING SAID WE FACE A PROPOSAL FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHICH WOULD -- LIMIT SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO USE THE PROTECTIONS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE WHEN THE LAW PASSED TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR THOSE TWENTY YEARS. OF FOR THE LARGE PART WITH VERY SMALL CHANGES. THOSE PROPOSED AS THE ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES TO THE RULE ARE IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH LEGISLATIVE HISTOPATHOLOGY FROM CONGRESS AND AS YOU HEARD LAST NIGHT WAS. THE FIRST DEADLINE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS AND OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE COMMENTED IN CALIFORNIA THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMMENTED INCLUDING EXPERTS ON RACE EQUITY AND A CHILD POVERTY. AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE HAD COMMENTS -- FROM WESTERN CENTER FROM THE FOOD BANKS THROUGHOUT THE THE STATE AND ALSO FROM -- LABOR EXPERTS AND WHAT EVERYBODY SAID -- IN PARTICULAR THE SHARED COMMENT WAS THAT HUNGER DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKE SOMEBODY BETTER ABLE TO FIND WORK. AT TO GO TO WORK AND TO STAY EMPLOYED. I'M. WE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THERE'S GREAT. RACIAL DISPARITIES EVEN THOUGH YOU COULD LOOK AT THE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WITHIN EACH COUNTY. YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THERE'S LARGE POCKETS OF PEOPLE WHO REMAIN EMPLOYED UNEMPLOYED AND THOSE PEOPLE AT OUR AT TEN TO BE. MEMBERS OF RACE RACIAL ETHNICITY A RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS MORE FREQUENTLY THEY TEND A P. B. FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. VETERANS PEOPLE SURVIVING DRUG ADDICTION SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE -- THEY TEND TO HAVE LOWER LITERACY RATES AND MANY MORE CHALLENGES TO EMPLOYMENT AND STABLE EMPLOYMENT AND NOT ONLY THAT. TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED WE ARE CALLING ME WAS MUCH DIFFERENT TODAY WE HAVE MANY MORE INDUSTRY JOBS THAT ARE NOT PERMANENT JOBS AND PEOPLE STRUGGLE. TO FIND AT TWENTY HOURS OF WORK IN A SINGLE JOB AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE PAIRING A GATHER MULTIPLE JOBS THEY DON'T HAVE A TINY OVER THEIR SCHEDULING WITH LACK OF A FAIR SCHEDULING POLICIES IN OUR STATE. SO ALL OF THE SAID THE RESEARCHERS SHOWED THAT. WORK AT THAT TIME LIMITS AND RELATED WORK REQUIREMENTS DON'T ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE FIND WORK. AT THAT WORK SUPPORTS AND PREVENTING HUNGER DO -- AND WITH THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE THAT CALIFORNIA -- STEP INTO THE SPACE OF PROVIDING. A STATE FUNDED BENEFIT. THROUGH THANK AT CREATING A STATE BANK -- SO THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO USE THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE THE ONE TWO THREE APPROACH -- BY SIMPLY CREATING A STATE BANK OF MONTHLY BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T GOTTEN ENOUGH HOURS TO MEET THE WORK ROLE OF THE TIME LIMIT OR WHO HAVE -- SIR PASSED THE THREE MONTHS IN A THIRTY SIX MONTH PERIOD TO PREVENT HUNGER AND ALSO TO PREVENT AN EROSION OF ECONOMIC FLOW INTO OUR FOOD ECONOMY. REMEMBER THE IN CALIFORNIA ARE FOOD ECONOMY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. IN OUR STATE WITH WITH HIGH PERCENTAGES OF PEOPLE RELYING ON OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO BUY FOOD IN ORDER FOR THEM TO TO HAVE WORKING KEEP WORK. SO WITH ALL OF THAT -- WE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSAL WE RECOGNIZE THAT. THERE WILL BE SOME CHALLENGES TO MAKE IT. TO MAKE IT WORK RIGHT BUT WE KNOW THAT THIS DEPARTMENT -- HAS PROVEN THEMSELVES TIME AND TIME AGAIN -- TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE MORE DANGEROUS A PROPOSALS COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WERE REALLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO DO THIS AS WELL. THANK [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT BAKER. NOTHING FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCER LA -- IN LIGHT OF WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO TO HAVE A SUPPLEMENTAL. OR TO HAVE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE SO WE CAN TRACK THE RISK OF POTENTIAL ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE POLICIES REGARDING A BOAT. THEY MAY NOT BE AN IMMEDIATE ISSUE NOW BUT IT COULD BE DIRE ISSUE. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE WORK THE UNCERTAINTY -- DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT SO I THINK THAT -- STAFF WILL BE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT WE CAN START WORKING ON THAT. EVERYTHING FROM THE VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT -- LET'S GO. TO ISSUE TâM. ELDERLY SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE HI TRACY PATTERSON FROM CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT IMPLEMENTING A SIMPLIFIED USER FRIENDLY CAL FIRST APPLICATION. FOR SENIOR DISABLED HOUSEHOLDS -- WE ARE PRESENTING THIS PROPOSAL ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS AT A R. P. CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS LOCAL FOOD BANKS ANTI HUNGER GROUPS AND ARE ALSO THANKFUL THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN WILL BE ADVANCING THIS PROPOSAL WITH IN THE LEGISLATURE. I'M SO WHEN IT COMES TO KILL FRESH WE REALLY ADVOCATE FOR COVERAGE BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM WE HAVE -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA HAS PERSISTENTLY LAGGED BEHIND THE NATION WHEN IT COMES TO AND ROLLING ELIGIBLE LOW INCOME SENIORS INTO CAL FRESH -- JUST UNDER 20% OF CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE LOW INCOME SENIORS ARE REACHED BY CAL FOR US WHICH IS THE LOWEST SENIOR PARTICIPATION RATE OF ANY STATE -- AND SO IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE PRESSING OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL THE NEWLY ELIGIBLE AS A SITE POPULATION INTO CAL FOR ASH IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE LOOK AT ALL PROMISING WAYS TO STREAMLINE ENROLLMENT INTO THE PROGRAM. ALSO CDSS COVERAGE HAS PARTICIPATED IN A FEDERAL DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM CALLED THE ELDERLY SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION PROJECT WHICH I'LL JUST CALL THE SAP A SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND WE COMMEND THE DEPARTMENTS LEADERSHIP AND GAINING FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR THIS PROJECT -- THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVEN HOUSEHOLDS IDENTIFIED AS EASE UP ELIGIBLE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND ALL NEWLY APPLYING SENIOR DISABLED HOUSEHOLDS CAN BENEFIT FROM THE POLICIES AND PROCESS SET IN PLACE BY THIS -- BUT BECAUSE THE FEDERAL PEOPLE WAS COST NEUTRAL WE HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED IS ACTUALLY A SIMPLIFIED USER FRIENDLY SENIOR APPLICATION -- AND SO THIS IS A STATE OPTION WE DON'T NEED FURTHER A FEDERAL APPROVAL TO DO THIS WE JUST NEED THE FUNDS -- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT MOST OTHER EAST UP STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED A SIMPLE APPLICATION WHICH IS ABOUT TWO TO EIGHT PAGES -- AND THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO OUR EXISTING CAL FRESH APPLICATION WHICH IS EIGHTEEN PAGES LONG AND CONTAINS MANY QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT RELEVANT TO THESE EASE UP HOUSEHOLDS. AND SO WE ARE RESPECTING A ONE TIME ALLOCATION TO IMPLEMENT A USER CENTERED SIMPLIFIED CAL FRESH APPLICATION -- THE COST ESTIMATE AN IDEA FOR THE PROJECT IS BASED ON EXISTING PROJECTS UNDER WAY -- THAT CDS US AND C. H. SS ARE IMPLEMENTING FOR USER CENTERED DESIGN PRINCIPLES IN APPLICATIONS AND RE CERTIFICATION FORMS AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THIS REQUEST WOULD BUILD UPON ALL OF THOSE LESSONS LEARNED. THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED AND THIS WOULD BE -- NARROWING IN ON THE SENIOR POPULATION -- WITH THE EXPANSION OF CALIFORNIA'S TO THE SS I POPULATION THIS IS EXTREMELY TIMELY -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT A SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION IS NOT A PANACEA I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE OUR SENIOR ENROLLMENT CRISIS -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED SORT OF AN ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH THAT WE ARE MATCHING BOTH POLICY AND PROCESS USED. TO GET THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT -- WE TRULY BELIEVE THAT SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES DESERVE TO LIVE AN AGE WITH DIGNITY AND FREE FROM HUNGER AND THIS IS ONE WAY WE CAN HELP. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK SPEAKER. I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL -- SO CERTAINLY AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL WE SUPPORT A REDESIGN OF FORMS THAT THEY CAN BE MORE USER FRIENDLY -- THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT HAS WORK GROUPS ON FOR VARIOUS CLIENT NOTICES ARE MADE CARRIED REPORT. THE CHALLENGE REALLY IS AROUND TIMING AND COST -- SO IMPLEMENTATION OF SS I WILL BE IN ABOUT SIXTY DAYS -- SO WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THIS BY JUNE FIRST THIS YEAR BUT CERTAINLY A LOOK AT FRANKLY NOT JUST THE SENIOR APT BUT THE OVERALL APPLICATION. THE SENIOR AT THE FAMILY FACING APP THE REPORT NEEDS A A RE LOOK IN SOME OF THE WAYS OF THE HEALTH FORMS. OKAY SO -- CERTAINLY THE FORMS YOU NEED TO RE LOOK IN THE OTHER TWO KEY TIMING PIECE OF COURSE IS THE AUTOMATION IT'S ONE THING TO REDESIGN FORM BUT THEN IT NEEDS TO BE AUTOMATED SO GET TO THE PERSON WHO NEEDS THAT FORMER THAT APPLICATION. AND AS YOU KNOW OUR THREE SYSTEMS ARE IN A PROCESS OF A MIGRATION TO TWO TO ONE SO THE THINKING ABOUT THE TIMING. THE PROCESS TO DESIGN THE FORMS AS A SYSTEM IN THE PART AND THE TIMING TO AUTOMATE THEM REQUIRES A A GOOD. STAKEHOLDER PLAN WITH ALL PARTIES HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS THIS PIECE FITS INTO IT. SO OUR CONCERNS ARE REALLY PRACTICAL NOT TO KNOW -- CONCEPTUAL CONCERNS THANK YOU LIKE SPEAKER. FROM THE FINANCE HELLO. I THINK MY FIRST QUESTION WAS IS ONE MILLION DOLLARS GOING TO DO THIS. AND I KNOW YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH STAFF ON THIS ALSO YEAH SO I THINK YOU KNOW FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING AND WORK IN THIS AREA FOR MANY YEARS A LOT OF THE COST IS THE AUTOMATION. AND SO THE DESIGN ITSELF IS THE AUTOMATION. AND SO THE DESIGN ITSELF YOU KNOW FROM OUR CONVERSATION WITH CONSULTANTS ANOTHER PROJECTS WOULD BE QUITE MINIMAL THIS COULD REALLY BUILD UPON LEARNING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE. I'M TALKING TO USERS AND HOW TO AUTOMATION COSTS WERE ESTIMATING AROUND A MILLION THAT TENDS TO BE -- A SIMILAR AUTOMATION COSTS BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL AS ADVOCATES SO -- I WOULD LEAVE THAT UP TO INPUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS IT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS DID HAVE TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT FOR THE NEARNESS -- OF THE JUNE FIRST EXPANSION OF A SOCIETY -- BUT YOU DON'T SEE THAT AS A POSSIBILITY. OF OF WHAT WOULD BE A TIME LINE THAT WOULD BE MORE. WELL WE'RE EIGHTEEN MY WORKABLE. TRACY WELL KNOWS WHERE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS INTO REDESIGNING THE EVERITT MID CARRIED REPORT. SO A COUPLE TWO TO THREE YEARS AND THEN THE CROSSWALK WITH THE MIGRATION -- GIVEN THE WE'RE MOVING FROM THREE TO TWO TO ONE SYSTEM WHAT'S THE MOST STRATEGIC AND COST EFFECTIVE TIME NOT WANTING TO WASTE TIME TO GET THIS -- INCREASE SERVICE TO SENIORS BUT ALSO BEING THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHEN IT SHOULD INTERSECT WITH THE MIGRATION PLAN. YEAH AND THEY WILL OUT I THINK YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS WE'RE TRYING TO GET READY FOR THE JUNE ONE ENROLLMENT THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE POPULATION THAT'S WHERE PARTICIPATION RATE IS STILL NINETEEN POINT 5% AND SO. WE WOULD LOVE THIS TO BE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE BUT THIS IS ALSO A LONG TERM NEED BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOON WE HOPE THE IDEA OF AS A SIGN CAL FRESH BEING COMPLICATED WILL. A RACE FROM PEOPLE'S MEMORIES AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND IT WILL TRULY JUST BE CAL FOR US FOR THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND SO YOU KNOW WE WOULD STILL BE EAGER TO SEE THIS AS A LONGER TERM PROJECT EVEN IF THE TIMELINE -- IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE SUMMER AND WE WOULD INTENDED DUAL PURPOSE IT AS THE RECERTIFICATION FORM FOR ALL THE NEW SSI FOLKS THE APPAN THE REFUNDABLE THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT. DOCTOR WOULD. A COUPLE QUESTIONS YOU TALK ABOUT AUTOMATION SO THAT MEAN THAT THESE ARE GOING TO BE -- AVAILABLE ONLINE FOR PEOPLE ARE WE LOOKING AT PAPER. THE ONE SO I THINK WITH THE WITH AUTOMATION HEN YOU HAVE A PAPER FORM IT'S STILL NEEDS TO BE AUTOMATED TO MATCH WITH THE DATABASE SYSTEM. SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE A PAPER FORM YOU STILL HAVE AUTOMATION CAUGHT AND I WAS MY QUESTION YET BUT THERE ARE ONLINE AND MOBILE PORTALS WE HAVE -- THREE DIFFERENT KINDS FOR THE THREE SYSTEMS WE HAVE NOW THEY'RE CONSOLIDATING TO ONE THERE'S ALSO APPLICATION OF SISTERS SO YOU CAN FOR INSTANCE THERE'S A PROJECT THAT CDSS IS FUNDED OF THE STATE WIDE. APPLICATION A SISTER CALLED GET CAL FRESH DOT WORK THAT OPERATES IN SORT OF A VERY MODERN WAY OF A RESPONSIVE APPLICATION WHERE IT WOULD JUST SKIP. THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO ASK SO THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN SEEING A PAPER FORM OF THE EIGHTEEN PAGES SO THE IDEA WOULD BE WHEN YOU HAVE AN ONLINE PORTAL -- THAT IT WOULD TRULY JUST BE RESPONSIVE SO IT BECOMES A SIMPLIFIED YOUR APPLICATION BY THE QUESTIONS THAT IT SKIPS. SO IT'S CURRENTLY IN EIGHTEEN PAGE APPLICATION IS GOING TO GO SMALLER. NO THE CURRENT CAL FRESH ONLY HAVE A IT'S EIGHTEEN YEAH IT'S IS EIGHTEEN THE CALPERS MEDI CAL CAL WORKS IS. FIFTY SIX YEAH. AND WE WHEN WE REDESIGN THE AS WE LIKE TO REDESIGN THE PAPER AND THE ONLINE THE ARCHITECTURE. SHOULD BE THE SAME AND THEY SHOULD HAVE. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE -- TO BE THE FORM YOU NEED NOT THE GIANT GOVERNMENT PACKAGE. IS SO THAT THESE THESE LONG FORMS OUR STATE FORMS ARE NOT FEDERAL FORMS. THEY ARE STATE FORMS DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS BUT WE HAVE -- JUST WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO REDESIGN THE MANY USER CENTERED WAY. JUST I GUESS I'M JUST STUNNED AT THE LENGTH WE ARE TORN YEAH. AND JUST. YEAH. QUESTION. A RECERTIFICATION -- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT I MEAN WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME. SB MCB RECERTIFICATION MEANS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO RE SIGN UP FOR THIS. THAT MEAN YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND FILL OUT THE EIGHTEEN PAGE FORM AGAIN. WELL -- FOR MOST FOLKS YES MOST FOLKS THEY REACT WISEMAN I MEAN WHO AM I AND WEAPON HERE BUT NOW. IF YOU'RE ELDERLY AND HAVE NO INCOME RIGHT FOR YOUR DISABLED RIGHT AND HAVE NO INCOME RIGHT THE LIKELIHOOD IS YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET YOUNGER. AND YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET ON TO SAY RIGHT SO FOR THIS POPULATION THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE MOVED TO THE EAST THAT PROGRAM IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO THOSE FOLKS GET THREE YEARS INSTEAD OF ONE YEAR AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE RE INTERVIEWED AT THREE YEARS THEY STILL DO THAT APPLICATION WE DO WE CLING TO CONFIRM. YOUR HERE YOUR IN CALIFORNIA NOTHING IS CHANGED WE'D LIKE TO MAKE THAT SIMPLER AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO AN INTERVIEW. AND WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. SO THEY HAVE BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO THERE WILL HAVE TO THAT RESEARCH CATION ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS UNDER OUR SENIOR PILOT BUT IT'S STILL EIGHTEEN PAGES. COULDN'T BE YOU'RE STILL IN CALIFORNIA YOU'RE STILL HERE. WE CAN'T SIMPLIFY THAT LITTLE BIT MORE. ME LIKE I SAID YOU'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT GETTING YOUNGER. THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE DISABLED YOU'RE DISABLED IN YOU'RE NOT GOING YOU KNOW I MEAN I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE PEOPLE. CAN RECOVER BUT BUT IT JUST -- I'M SORRY IT JUST THIS SEEMS REALLY ONEROUS. AND TO WHAT END. YEAH IT'S IT IS THE FUNCTION HAVING UNIVERSAL APPLICATION THAT SERVES FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS A YEAR SO WE'RE ASKING ABOUT INCOME IN CHILDREN AND ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT RELEVANT FOR THIS POPULATION WHICH IS STILL. YOU KNOW 10% OF OUR CASELOAD BUT THEY'RE DEALING WITH THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE UNIVERSAL LET'S ASK YOU EVERYTHING POSSIBLE APPLICATION WE KNOW BETTER ABOUT WHAT THE KIND APPLICATION THEY NEED. BUT STILL RECERTIFICATION IS GOING TO REQUIRE THE SAME EIGHTEEN PAGE APPLICATION. UNDER THE PROPOSAL HERE THERE WAS A SIMPLIFIED SENIOR APP THAT COULD ALSO BE USER RECERTIFICATION. THERE IS SUPER SIMPLIFIED VERSION. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE LIKE. THERE ARE REQUIRED FEDERAL YOU KNOW NAME ADDRESS RESIDENCY SOURCES OF INCOME. THERE ARE AND THERE'S YOU KNOW IDEAS TO THIS IS WHAT YOU TOLD US THREE YEARS AGO CAN YOU TELL US IF THERE'S A CHANGE OR NO CHANGE THOSE THINGS WITH DESIGN AND AUTOMATION THAT CAN. MAKE THAT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE SO MUCH BETTER. SURE HOPE SO. I'M SURE YOU CAN TELL FROM THE QUESTIONS THAT PERHAPS THIS IS AN AREA THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IT AND THERE ARE SO MANY YEARS TO SO MANY PROBLEMS THAT. THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT IF IF THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS SO OWNERS. IF ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S REVIEWING IT SO THAT'S TAKING ALSO TIME FROM. THAT WORKER ALSO TO REVIEW EVERYTHING SO. SOMETHING TO CONSIDER -- YEAH AND I GUESS I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE WE DO THE SAME THING WITH THE MEDI CAL SYSTEM TO MEAN SOMEONE WHO IS. WHO IS PERMANENTLY DISABLED STILL HAS TO AT POINTS GO THROUGH A PROCESS? TO RECERTIFY THAT THERE PERMANENTLY DISABLED -- I JUST FOR IT JUST FEELS LIKE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WASTED TIME AND EFFORT -- AND IT'S MAYBE IT'S THE END OF THE DAY AND I'M FRUSTRATED BUT BUT MY GOODNESS YOU KNOW. IT IS THE END OF THE DAY BUT IT'S STILL SOMETHING THAT IS ONLY FOR LESS I KNOW. I KNOW BUT IT IS IT IS I WANT TO TALK TO YOU FRUSTRATED BUT IT IS THE END OF THE DAY SO IT IS A LONG DAY BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THE AREN'T ANY POPULATION -- THEIR SOMETHINGS ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE AND I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE STREAMLINED IS GOING TO BE SIMPLIFIED. BUT YOU'RE HEARING THAT IF IT CAN BE SIMPLE FARTED PICKING BE STREAMLINED IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT. OF MISTER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I'M GONNA ECHO -- MY COLLEAGUES OF KIND OF THIS MAY THAT WE PUT THIS ONEROUS TASK ON SOME FOLKS -- IN IN THE MEDI CAL COMPONENT YOU KNOW I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN. WHERE THEY'VE ASKED DO YOU STILL HAVE CEREBRAL PALSY? OKAY THIS IS THE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS JUST. RIDICULOUS. AND YOU KNOW IT HI DID I HEAR YOU SEE THE WORKING ON THIS TWO TO THREE YEARS. ON THIS ON THIS PROCESS RIGHT HERE -- OKAY. WHAT IS YOUR -- TO FALTER YOU TO CLIMB PEOPLE BASED ON SOME OF THESE ONEROUS TASK THAT THEY JUST. BY CAN'T DO IT ARE AND WHAT KIND OF ASSISTANCE TO YOU GIVE -- GOING FORWARD I MEAN THERE THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO JUST DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO FILL OUT FORMS [inaudible] AND AND IF THEY DON'T FILL IT OUT RIGHT. AND YOUR KICKING IT OUT. WHAT KIND OF TIME FRAMES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT TO GET IN GETTING THESE FOLKS? ASSISTANCE I MEAN. WE KNOW IT'S IT'S A LARGE -- POPULATION THAT DOES AS WELL AND AGAIN I GUESS BECAUSE I'M SEEING. EIGHTEEN PAGES ON FIFTY SIX ON ANOTHER -- I'M THINKING THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT MAKES MISTAKES. AND DECLINED MMHM -- THAT'S NOT COOL. ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY -- A PRIORITY HAS BEEN FOR THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION AND TO THE NEW SO MINISTRATION TO STREAMLINE ALL OF THESE PROCESSES TO GET EVERY FEDERAL WAIVER WE CAN. TO MOVE THINGS ONLINE. TO MOVE INTERVIEWS TO TELEPHONE FROM FACE TO FACE. TO VERIFY THINGS ELECTRONICALLY TAKE A PICTURE OF YOUR PAY STUB AND ON YOUR PHONE AND SEND IT TO ME RATHER THAN GO FIND A COPIER IN THE POST OFFICE SO WE HAVE IT EVERY STEP TRIED TO ELIMINATE WASTE. WE'VE ALSO ADDED TO OUR PUBLIC DATA DASHBOARD. TO METRICS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT. LITTLE WONKY HERE BUT ONE IS PROCEDURAL DENIAL. THAT'S A PERSON DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE PROCESS WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW. IF THEY WERE ELIGIBLE OR NOT BUT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO FINISH THE AT REQUIRED INTERVIEW THE REQUIRED VERIFICATION AND WE WATCH THAT NUMBER VERY CAREFULLY AND SHARE WITH OUR COUNTIES THEIR INNOVATION OF BEST PRACTICES TO REDUCE. SAME THING AT RESERVE VACATION IT'S CALLED TURN. RIGHT WILL YOU DON'T GET THROUGH THE PROCESS WHEN YOU COME BACK INTERRUPTING THE BENEFIT THAT YOU NEED TO BE HEALTHY AND STABLE AND CREATING MORE WORK AND WASTE. SO WE ARE VERY WITHIN OUR FEDERAL FRAMEWORK. IN WITHIN THE CAN WITH DRIVEN BY COUNTY INNOVATION WHERE CAN WE THREE STEPS WE GOTTA DO APPLY INTERVIEW AND VERIFY HOW DO WE STREAMLINED EACH OF THOSE WE CAN MEET YOU AT THE DOOR YOU WANT TO WALK THROUGH. IT'S SUCH A IT'S AN ONGOING CHALLENGE SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD I WOULD ASK THEM. IS THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE AGENCIES. TO SAY THAT THESE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS ARE ONEROUS AND AND AND TASK US TO WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL ACTIVES. TO MAKE CHANGE -- BECAUSE THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TO CONTINUAL. CONTINUALLY DO THESE ONEROUS BECAUSE OF FEDERAL REGULATION. AND WE'VE BEEN WE'VE INVOLVED TECHNOLOGY IS HERE -- THERE'S EASIER WAYS TO DETERMINE -- OUTCOMES AND I'M LIKE I SAID I HOPE I WOULD REALLY THINK THAT. THAT YOU KNOW. THE PEOPLE ARE SYMPATHETIC IN THE LEGISLATURE [inaudible] LAWLER BUT LEE SIXTY ONE OF MORE -- I WILL TELL YOU. THAT. CONTACT YOUR FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES AND SEEKING CHANGE [inaudible] IS. IRAN AND I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT THE SEVEN YEARS I'VE NEVER SEEN AN OUT REACH TO ME. ABOUT THESE THESE ARE ONEROUS TO THE AGENCY WE NEED TO CHANGE OR ALL OR HARMFUL TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT. I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE CONVEYED. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER. OF THE LAST -- ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN OF REGARDING THIS AREA CRESSMAN WE'RE WE'RE JUST DOCTOR AGO SO AS I'M SITTING HERE AND I GUESS IT IT.

AND SO WHY PART OF I I WOULD HAVE TO GET I'M I'M A GAS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE PART IS MAYBE THIS THESE ONEROUS APPLICATIONS I MEAN. HAVE HAVE THERE BEEN STUDIES TO REALLY FIND OUT WHAT IT IS THAT'S DRIVING THAT 80%. OF OUR SENIORS THEY'RE ELIGIBLE HERE ARE PROBABLY. HUNGRY YES. YES WE IN ADDITION TO BEING POOR.

WHAT WAS IT THE WORST -- WE HAVE THE LOWEST PER TO SENIORS SNAP PARTICIPATION RATE OF ANY STATE. OF IT SO SOMETHING IS WRONG.

THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NOW. AND NOW WE'RE REALLY ARE GOING TO ISSUE NUMBER -- ELEVEN THE LAST OF THE ISSUES IN THIS SECTION. WELCOME. WE'RE GOING TO START WITH KIM. THIS IS. I CAN OWNERS PROPOSAL GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS -- BUT WE WE RUN TO FEDERAL PROGRAMS OF THE REGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH GOES FOR ABOUT FIFTY FOOD BANK STATEWIDE TO GIVING OUT WHAT USED TO BE GOVERNMENT COMMODITIES GOVERNMENT CHEESE BUT NOW IS A MIX OF US AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. YOU ALSO MAY BE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT OUR COMMODITY SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD PROGRAM WHICH IS OUR SENIOR FOOD BOX WERE NOW THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY -- OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND SENIORS GETTING A BOX OF HEALTHY FOOD AND THE FOOD MIX JUST CHANGE TO BE EVEN MORE HEALTHY NUTRITIOUS MIX FOR SENIORS. AND JUST OF THOSE TWO FEDERAL PROGRAMS WE RUN A SERIES OF STATE PROGRAMS AND MOST RECENTLY CAL FOOD -- PROVIDING CAL PRODUCE TO THAT SAME NETWORK OF FOOD BANKS THERE'S ALSO BEEN -- THE ONE TIME INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS DIAPER BANKS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE BIG TRENDS FOR US JUST QUICKLY A DISASTER FOOD BANK FOOD WAS PROVIDED AND YOU COUNTY AGAIN IN RESPONSE TO THE TO THE FIRES WITH PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDS. WE'VE ALSO HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF FOOD BECAUSE OF THE TRADE SURPLUS BECAUSE OF PURCHASING DECISIONS BY USDA SO FOOD BANKS ARE ABSORBING AND DISTRIBUTING ON PRESS AND AMOUNTS OF TRADE SURPLUS FOOD -- AND WE ARE ALSO TAKING A FRESH LOOK AT HOW ARE LOGISTICS WHICH LOGISTICS THIS YEAR LOOKING AT WHERE WE HAVE WAREHOUSES IN STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MEMBER FOOD BANKS AND THE BANK ASSOCIATION IT'S TIME FOR A FRESH LOOK AND SO WE'RE DOING THAT. THAT'S A SHORT SUMMARY OF THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WHAT [inaudible] THE DID YOU PRESENT ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. SURE THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED A TWO MILLION INCREASE TO CALIPHATE ON TOP OF THE SIX MILLION THE PAST TWO YEARS. AND IS ALSO A ONE TIME TWENTY MILLION -- INFRASTRUCTURE -- WANT TO INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT ON TOP OF FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION ALL THE PRIOR YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN REYES AND THEN THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ANDREW SHAM HERE FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS -- REPRESENTING THE CONNECTION PARTNERSHIP OF SAN BENITO COUNTY AND AND FOOD BANKS ACROSS ACROSS THE STATE TO BE SPEAKING TO BOTH. OF ADVOCACY PROPOSALS TO INCREASE THE THE CAL FOOD INVESTMENT -- AND AND AND IT ALL TO START BY SAYING MY THANKS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE ONE TIME ON THE CAPACITY -- JUST INCREDIBLY GENEROUS AND AND REALLY JUST EXCITED TO SEE THE RESPONSIVENESS IN HIS VERY FIRST -- BUDGET ON THAT AND JUST TO THE POINT THAT -- ISN'T QUITE WAIT MADE ABOUT THE THE TRADE MITIGATION FOOD IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A THERE IS A LARGE TEMPERING INCREASE IN FEDERAL COMMODITIES INTERVAL TO FOOD BANKS BUT THE CAME WITH NO STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION FUNDING -- AND SO THAT FOOD IS NOT GONNA TRUCK ITSELF KEEP ITSELF COLD LET ALONE SAFE -- FOR RESIDENTS TO EAT AND SO THAT REALLY DOVETAILS WITH WHY WE ARE ADVOCATING BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS ON THESE ISSUES BUT CERTAINLY VERY EXCITED TO SEE ON THE RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS ANY FOR FOR CAPACITY -- AND AS I TALK ABOUT HELP YOU JUST A BRIEF NOTE ON EMERGENCY SAFETY NET AND WHY IT IS VITAL FOR THE STATE TO INVESTMENT ONLY IN ITS PUBLIC PROGRAMS I APPRECIATE THAT. THE PRIOR DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CAL FRESH IS OBVIOUSLY IS OUR FIRST AND BEST DEFENSE AGAINST HUNGER -- BUT AS YOUR MATERIALS ILLUSTRATE WHETHER IT'S THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING WHETHER IT'S THAT THE DEVASTATING FIRES I MEAN IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE RED EMPIRE -- FOOD BANK THEY'RE STILL DEALING WITH THE CINEMA FIRE THE LONG TAIL WHEN FOLKS HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES THEY'VE BEEN DISRUPTED -- YOU KNOW WE ARE THE ONES WITHOUT -- FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT -- FEEDING US THIS HOUSEHOLDS AND THEN MOST RECENTLY THE FEDERAL THREATS YOU HEARD THAT THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ABLE BODIED ADULTS THE THREAT AS WELL AS PUBLIC CHARGE WE HAVE HOUSEHOLDS COMING INTO FOOD BANKS ASKING TO COME OFF OF COVERAGE. BECAUSE IT'S MORE TRUSTED SITES CAUGHT THE PROGRAM AND NOTHING IS MORE HEARTBREAKING FOR AN APPLICATION CISTERCIAN PEOPLE ON THE PROGRAM THEN DID THEN BE FACING THAT. AND THEN LASTLY JUST BRIEFLY THAT THE FEDERAL SHUTDOWN AND I THINK WE ALL SAW THAT SO MANY HOUSEHOLD EVEN IF THEY'RE EMPLOYED ARE JUST ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM HAVING TO COME TO FOOD BANKS. AND THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTIONS LET ALONE THE SNAP GAP AND MY SINCERE THANKS TO THE PART. TO THE COUNTY SEAT MINISTRATION BRING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE UNDER THEIR POWER -- BUT EVEN AN AVERAGE MONTH A THIRD OF HOUSEHOLDS ON CALPERS ARE STILL COMING TO FOOD BANKS BECAUSE THE BENEFIT DOESN'T LAST MONTH AND THE SNAP GAP -- REALLY HIGHLIGHTED HOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT THE BACKSTOP THIS AND SO THAT'S WHERE CAL FOOD PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE AGAIN -- AS MISSING OKAY WAIT SAID WE ARE SO GRATEFUL TO SEE IN THE GOVERNOR'S FIRST BUDGET THE CONTINUATION OF THE EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR TOTAL LEVEL -- AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK -- THE GOVERNOR FOR CONTINUING THAT THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION'S GOING TO AT LEAST SIX BILLION DOLLARS BUT THEN IT HAS BEEN EIGHT MILLION TOTAL THE PAST TWO YEARS BUT I ASK IS TO RAISE THAT TO TWENTY FOUR POINT. FIVE WHICH IS ACTUALLY AS YOUR AGENDA NICELY POINTS OUT THAT'S THAT'S THE MAXIMUM WE COULD PUT TO OUR SYSTEM THERE ARE REAL CAPACITY IMITATIONS IF YOU GO TO A FOOD BANK. YOU KNOW THAT THE WAREHOUSES RIGHT -- THERE'S NOT SPACED OUT TO PUT THE FOOD THEY'RE TRYING TO FILL IT TOO DIDN'T THERE AND DONATIONS AND BY AND LARGE THROUGH BANKS ARE SUPPORTED YOU KNOW 9095% WITH PRIVATE DONATIONS. BUT IT'S THAT SMALL PIECE OF THE STATE CAN FIND AT THE FEDERAL -- COMMODITIES THAT COME THROUGH THE HELP SUPPORT THAT -- REALLY ALLOW US TO BUY THAT THE PRODUCE THE PROTEINS AND A HALF FROM THIS PARTICULAR POSITION OF THOSE BUTLER FROM SAMBAR AND YOU KNOW IT'S TURKEY ALMONDS AND OAT MEAL THERE ALL ONLINE WITH THEIR HEALTHY FOOD BANK POLICY. ON THAT YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE TRICKING ALMONDS YOU KNOW VERY VERY EXPENSIVE NOT GONNA GET DONATED AND IT'S IT'S THOSE KIND OF ITEMS THAT THE BANKS ARE USING THESE THESE VALUABLE PURCHASE DOLLARS. FOR AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE BANG FOR THE BUCK -- MOSTLY BANKSARE SEARCHING THOSE TO ABOUT FORTY FIVE MILES PER DOLLAR BECAUSE AGAIN THEY'RE LEVERAGING THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND ALL THE PRIVATE DONATIONS -- SO IT THE THE WISE USE OF STATE RESOURCES. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING MISS BUTLER FROM SAM PORTANTINO. QUESTIONS YES DOCTOR WOULD IN THE MOST FRAZIER. QUESTION -- HOW HOW MANY OF THE DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY -- GOING BACK TO OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATION SENIORS MIGHT BE COMING IN WHO. WHO ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET? HOW FRESH THEY'RE THEY'RE COMING INTO YOUR FACILITY FOR EMERGENCY FOOD? YEAH IT'S A IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS A GOOD FOR US TO ANSWER BECAUSE AS I TESTIFIED TO WITH SIMILAR PUBLIC CHARGE WE SPECIFICALLY DON'T ASK VERY MANY QUESTIONS -- I WILL TRY AND SEE IF YOUR FOOD BANK FOR EXAMPLE IF IT MAKES IN YOUR DISTRICT -- ARE ASKING AT LEAST BASIC DEMOGRAPHICS LIKE ARE YOU OLDER AMERICAN ARE YOU SENIOR SOME KIND OF AGE SOMETIMES THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED BUT IN GENERAL WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID THOSE QUESTIONS WHICH MAKES I WISH I HAD BETTER. A DATA FOR A QUESTION LIKE THAT SO I GUESS THAT BRINGS ME TO MY OTHER QUESTION WHICH IS. SINCE PEOPLE ARE COMING THERE FOR FOOD AND AND MANY OF THEM MIGHT BE SENIORS. SHOULD WE NOT BE HAVING STATE RESOURCES THERE TO HELP ENROLL PEOPLE IN CAL FRONT SHIP THEY'RE ELIGIBLE. AND HELP THEM THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS. ON SITE COULD WE NOT FIGURE OUT A WAY TO INTEGRATE SOME OF THOSE SERVICES TO MAKE IT EASIER. YES AND WE DO SO IT WENT OUT I WAS I WAS OUR PRICING NAY MONNING DID YOU KNOW EXACT AMOUNTS -- SO AS TO WHAT NONE OF US ANSWER TO WE DID. THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW I JUST I JUST WANT TO SEE IT DONE YOU KNOW. MAIL COULDN'T COULDN'T AGREE MORE -- AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME DATA THAT FOOD BANKS HAVE I KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE ALAMEDA COUNTY COMMITTEE FOOD BANK WHICH HAS MORE RESOURCES TO DO THESE KIND OF DEMOGRAPHIC SURVEYS NOTED THAT FROM TWENTY TEN WHICH IS AROUND THE TIME OF THE CUTS TO THE EXERCISES P.. GRANTS TO TWENTY FOURTEEN IS A QUADRENNIAL SURVEY THEIR SENIOR POPULATION DOUBLED AND SO WE KNOW WE HAVE SOME SOME BROAD STROKES IN KNOWING -- THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE SENIOR POSITION CAL FRESH THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT BETWEEN THE LOW GRANTS THE EXCLUSION WHICH AGAIN IS GONNA AND IN JUNE FIRST FOR US IS THAT RECIPIENTS THAT SENIORS ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN OUR IN OUR LINES AND THERE'S MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO TURN ADDRESS THAT. BUT SPECIFICALLY -- FOOD BANKS TO HOLD ONE OF THE LARGEST -- PRIME OCT SUBCONTRACTS ON COVERAGE OUT REACH AND IT IS A VITAL PARTNERSHIP IN LINE OR WITH WITH PRIVATE CONSULTATIONS I'M TRYING TO ASSESS FOLKS TO GET OUT OF THE PROGRAM AND AND AND ADDRESSING SOME OF THE MISS THAT MISSING QUITE WAIT ADDRESS BECAUSE LOTS OF SENIOR SAY THINGS LIKE. ALL I DON'T ONE ELSE EVEN FOR SOMEONE ELSE OR IT'S ONLY FIFTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH TO REALLY TRYING TO TO PAINT THAT PICTURE IT'S THAT RICHARD IS A BIG PART OF THE PUSH FOR JUNE FIRST WITH SSI. THANK YOU. MISTER FRAZIER THANK YOU -- SO. AND CONTRA COSTA THEIR BULGING AT THE SEAMS WITH -- WITH PRODUCT IN IN IN THE JUST NOT ENOUGH ROOM SO I CAN APPRECIATE TALK ABOUT THE CAPITAL NEED -- BUT IN YOUR IN YOUR FIRE YOU TALK ABOUT THE THE STATE'S CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIONS CAN YOU. SHARE WITH US WHAT IT WOULD -- HOW MUCH IT DIMINISHES THE ABILITY BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR OF YOUR DOING ABOUT ONE EIGHT OF THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA? FEEDING RIGHT NOW -- HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES THE TO DO THESE RESTRICTIONS? LIMIT YOU ARE TAKE AWAY FROM YOU BEING ABLE TO SERVICE. SO THAT'S GONNA VERY AND I MAY HAVE BEEN FELT ABOUT THE ANY MONEY IN A MONEY YOU KNOW I'M OUT. WELL IT IT IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO GET TO QUALIFY AT THE TOP JUST BECAUSE WHAT'S THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS ARE HAPPENING THERE ARE THE THE CLEAN BURNING YOU KNOW EMISSIONS STANDARDS FOR TRUCKS. AND NOT FOR SOMETHING MAKES IS GONNA REQUIRE AN ENTIRE FLEET OVERALL -- AND SO I HAVE TO CHECK WITH THE SHAMAN AND AND LARRY AT YOUR YOUR FEEDBACK ABOUT IS THAT WHAT THAT MEANS BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE IS THE THE STATE TRYING TO DIVERT 20% OF EDIBLE FOOD. FROM LANDFILL TO PEOPLE WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS A NOBLE GOAL BUT WHO IS STUCK TRYING TO GET THAT FOOD FROM FROM A TO B. IS THE EMERGENCY FOOD RECOVERY SYSTEM. WITH YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND SO IT IS A COMPLICATED PICTURE FOR PROJECTS RIGHT NOW. WELL WE'VE SEEN IN THE RECYCLE INDUSTRY THAT WE CREATED A CONDAMINE IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES AND THEN THEY MONOPOLIZED IT AND THEN THEY TOOK DROVE IT INTO THE TOILET SO. I MEAN. WHEN THE THINGS DON'T ARE WORKING ON IT ON? MONIES -- PROGRAM. SUCH AS YOURS AND YOU NEED TO REACH OUT TO US THE LEGISLATURE TO MAYBE POSSIBLY. CREATING OFFRAMP IN LEGISLATION THAT WHEN CAN'T WHEN YOU CAN AND IT IS. OF DURABLE. OF THE THEN EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE BUT IF IT'S ONEROUS AND A RESTRICTIVE AND ACTUALLY IMPACTS YOUR YOUR BOTTOM LINE OF HELPING THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE CHARGED TO DO. FROM THE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT AND SO THAT WE CAN ADJUST ITS NOBLE TO HAVE. GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS BUT WAS HARMFUL TO A POPULATION IT YOU ARE. PUTTING YOURSELF OUT THERE AGAIN I ABSOLUTE MEYER WHAT YOU'RE DOING. WHEN I HAD A COMMUNITY FOUNDATION -- THE FOOD BANK WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR THE POPULATION THAT WE WERE SERVING -- BUT WE SOMETIMES MAKE -- DECISIONS THAT HAVE GONE INTO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR OTHER. OTHER FOLKS AND SO WE NEED TO BE VOCAL AND BE ABLE TO ADJUST THOSE WHEN THEY'RE IMPROPER. I HAVE SOME IN DEPTH REGULAR COME INSIDE I'LL BE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH -- ALL IN GOOD THANK YOU I'LL GIVE YOU HIS CELL PHONE NUMBER. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT IS THE THE LAST OF THIS PARTICULAR AREA -- I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE PRESENTERS -- IN THIS AREA -- AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. AND AGAIN I REMIND YOU. BECAUSE I DO WANT EVERYONE. TO GET HOME. HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR FAMILY SPEND TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY SLEEPING YOUR OWN BAD. SO I ASK AGAIN THAT WE LIMITED TO ONE MINUTE -- AND TELL US WHICH SITE WHICH OF THE ISSUES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OR ALL OF THEM THANK YOU.

BETTER LATE THAN NEVER AND DEFINITELY SUPPORT MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT STRATEGY -- AND ON NUMBER -- ELEVEN I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT ARE USED TO WORK AT THE SAN FRANCISCO MARIN FOOD BANK I'M WHICH IS A MISTER TINGS DISTRICT -- AND CAN SPEAK FIRST HAND TO HOW IMPACTFUL THE CALHOUN FUNDING WAS. THEM. OUR FOOD EGGS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT IS YOU KNOW REALLY NUTRITIOUS SOURCE OF PROTEIN AND ALSO AN ITEM THAT'S BASICALLY NEVER DONATED AND FAIRLY EXPENSIVE TO PURCHASE. I AM. AND I THINK OF THE TIME WE WERE PURCHASING SIXTY THOUSAND DOZEN EGGS A MONTH IN ORDER TO SERVE PEOPLE EVERY OTHER WEEK WITHOUT PROTEIN SOURCE SO -- ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW GREATLY APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENT THAT'S BEEN MADE SO FAR WE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT TIME BUDGET ITEM INCREASED SO THAT WE CAN SERVE EVEN MORE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI TRACY PATTERSON CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES I DON'T SEE ANYTHING MORE ABOUT ISSUE TEN BUT ON ISSUE NINE JUST WANNA REALLY STROH A STRONG SUPPORT FOR STRENGTHENING THE STATE BANK FOR EXEMPTIONS -- I'M A FORMER FOOD STAMP RECIPIENT MYSELF WHEN I WAS ON FOOD STAMPS I WAS IN A BOXIF I HAD BEEN CUT OFF AFTER THREE MONTHS I REALLY WOULD HAVE STRUGGLE TO GET THE FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT GONE TO GET A MASTER'S DEGREE.

ALL RIGHT THAT CONCLUDES THE PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU ALL AGAIN -- TO ALL THE PANELISTS. FOR THE NEXT. ISSUE ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE IT HAS TO DO WITH IMMIGRATION RAPID RESPONSE OF IMMIGRATION SERVICES PROGRAM. AND ASSOCIATED ADVOCACY PROPOSALS. ALL RIGHT WHERE CELEBRITIES. FROM THE DEPARTMENT WELCOME THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEES THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TONIGHT TO SPEAK TO THE IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES -- WE PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE WITH THAT A REPORTS ON THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY ADMINISTERING AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS -- ON THAT REPORT. WE JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW ITEMS AND ADDRESS A THE TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION RELATED TO THE DOCTOR LEGAL SERVICES THAT WAS POSED RIGHT BY THE COMMITTEE. SO THE COMMITTEE KNOWS CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT IS ADMINISTERING TO ONGOING LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAMS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF ONE TIME INVESTMENT STUFF FOR LEGAL SERVICES AND OTHER. SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS -- THE LARGER OF THE TWO PROGRAMS IS THE ONE CALIFORNIA OR IMMIGRATION SERVICES FUNDING WHICH IS IN ITS FOURTH YEAR -- THIS YEAR THE DEPARTMENT AWARDED GRANTS TO ONE HUNDRED AND ONE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PROVIDE NATURALIZATION SERVICES REMOVAL DEFENSE OTHER IMMIGRATION REMEDIES. A EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- JUST TO BRIEFLY A BREAK DOWN OF THE INVESTMENT ABOUT 14% OF THE INVESTMENT WENT TOWARD NATURALIZATION SERVICES. ABOUT 20% -- TOWARD REMOVAL DEFENSE AND THEN A 26% TOWARD OTHER IMMIGRATION REMEDIES. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO MADE AN INVESTMENT OF ABOUT TWO POINT NINE MILLION AND CAPACITY PROGRAMS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO EXPAND LEGAL SERVICES IN UNDERSERVED REGIONS OR FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS EXAMPLES OF THAT INCLUDE. EXTENDING SERVICES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY CENTRAL COAST AND FOUR API COMMUNITIES DEPORTED VETERANS -- THE OTHER ONGOING PROGRAM CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT IS THE LEGAL SERVICES FOR UNACCOMPANIED UNDOCUMENTED MINORS -- THAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN PLACE NOW FOR FIVE YEARS AND WITHOUT PROGRAM THE TO IT HAS BEEN ABLE TO FUND SERVICES FOR OVER THREE THOUSAND MINERS TO DATE. ABOUT 80% OF THE THE MINERS WHO HAVE WHO HAVE SOUGHT RELIEF THROUGH THAT PROGRAM ARE SEEKING ASYLUM RELIEF -- WHICH SPEAKS TO THE COUNTRY CONDITIONS THAT THEY ARE FLEEING -- AND MOSTLY NORTHERN -- TRIANGLE COUNTRIES. AND THEN FINALLY I CAN SPEAK TO THE QUESTION AROUND THE DOCK A LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM THAT WAS POSED BY BY THE COMMITTEE -- SO AS THE COMMITTEE IS LIKELY AWARE -- DHAKA AS A REMEDY -- REMAINS QUITE UNCERTAIN -- THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION HAS ASKED THE US SUPREME COURT TO TAKE IT UPON REVIEW WHICH THEY DECLINED TO DO IN THIS TERM BUT POTENTIALLY COULD DO SO IN THE IN THE FOLLOWING TERM. THERE ARE ROUGHLY I WOULD SAY ABOUT. EIGHT LAWSUITS INVOLVING DAKEN FOR DIFFERENT DISTRICT COURT CASES ANYONE OF THEM COULD. MOVE FORWARD IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS FROM THEM AS MUCH AS WE ARE WE ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF THE OF THE SUPREME COURT. TAKING ON ON THE ON THE CASE THAT SAID WHEN THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENT TO TERMINATE DHAKA IN SEPTEMBER. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE STATE MADE MADE AN INVESTMENT OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ASSIST DHAKA ELIGIBLE. IMMIGRANTS WITH A WITH WRITTEN WITH DOC A RENEWALS -- THAT FUNDING HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED AS OF MARCH OF THIS YEAR -- ROUGHLY OVER AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD THE FUNDING WAS EXHAUSTED WITH A ABOUT 90% OF THE FUNDS BEING USED FOR FOR DOCTOR RENEWALS AND ALSO FOR YOU TO SUPPORT THE USCIS FILING FEES WHICH ARE ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER PER APPLICATION. WITHOUT FUNDING -- THE PROVIDERS WHICH THE DEPARTMENT -- AWARDED GRANTS TO WERE ABLE TO ASSIST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WITH RENEWALS -- SIXTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED USCIS FILING FEES AS WELL AS PROVIDING OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AROUND. DOCK -- WHICH IS WHICH IS A VERY MUCH NEEDED BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE CONSTANT CHANGES AROUND DHAKA. CITY REACHED ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS -- THROUGH EDUCATION OUTREACH. COULD YOU BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. ABSOLUTELY -- THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING TO OF CONTINUOUS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR IT LEGAL SERVICES THAT INCLUDES FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ONE CALIFORNIA FUND. IT ALSO INCLUDES THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE UNACCOMPANIED UNDOCUMENTED MINOR FUND. AND IT ALSO INCLUDES MAKING -- OF SEVERAL ONE TIME A FUNDING -- FUNDING SOURCES ON GOING SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM FOR LEGAL SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANTS -- STUDENTS AND STAFF TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AS WELL AS A TEN MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION -- THAT PRIMARILY FOCUSES ON LEGAL SERVICES FOR BENEFICIARIES OF TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO. ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO AND AND UNACCOMPANIED MINORS OR MINOR SPACING REMOVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LIKE SPEAKER PLEASE. THE NAME TAMAKO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND RESPONSE THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA REGARDING THE RAPID RESPONSE FURTHER IF I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO SOME CLARIFICATIONS THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS REQUESTING RESOURCES FOR A RESERVE SIMILAR TO THE FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AND IS NOT BUDGET UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE REQUESTED TWENTY MILLION. WOULD BE AND A SEPARATE RESERVE AND I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS RESERVE WAS DESIGNED TO BE FLEXIBLE IN ORDER TO MEET FUTURE EMERGENT SITUATIONS REGARDING IMMIGRATION HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHERE FEDERAL FUNDING WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE. WELL WE CAN ANTICIPATE WHAT FUTURE SITUATIONS MAY MATERIALIZE THEM MINISTRATION WANTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS FUNDING AVAILABLE THAT CAN BE DISTRIBUTED. TO THE MOST APPROPRIATE STAY ENTITY. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE IN A RESPONSIVE MANNER. AND IN A VERY RESPONSIVE TIME FRAME WE'RE WORKING ON WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW THAT WE'RE HOPING TO RELEASE BY THE END OF THE MONTH BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO KEEP COMMITTEE STAFF AND THANK YOU AND IF. WE CAN GO BACK TO MYSTERIES. ON THE RAPID RESPONSE. COULD YOU. COMMENT. COMMENTS ON THE RAPID RESPONSE THE TWENTY MILLION. ABSOLUTELY THE GOVERNOR'S -- BUDGET IS PROPOSING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR RAPID RESPONSE -- FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF MADE OF THE THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE AND CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS TRANSFERRED IT TO ABOUT TWO POINT TWO MILLION. DOLLARS OF THAT FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO ADMINISTER -- WHICH THAT FUNDING HAS BEEN AWARDED TO AN ORGAN A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION IN OF SAN DIEGO -- ARE OPERATING A SHELTER THAT IS PROVIDING SHELTER SERVICES TO TO THE MIGRANT FAMILIES ARRIVING IN IN IN SAN DIEGO [inaudible] THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF CERTAINLY -- TONY MOTEL. YES -- LA ON HE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTION. SIX I WANTED TO REVIEW MY QUESTIONS I BELIEVE YOU'VE ALREADY COVERED THEM SONOMA [inaudible] CAN YOU. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS -- COULD DSS WORK WITH ANOTHER AGENCY IF NECESSARY THROUGH INTER DEPARTMENTAL COORDINATION. SYDNEY TEMAT APARTMENT FINANCE WE BELIEVE THE RESERVE AS AS IT'S CURRENTLY PROPOSES UNLESS TIME EFFICIENT MECHANISM. SO AND TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THESE EMERGENT SITUATIONS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING WE MAY NOT KNOW WHICH STATE AGENCY WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE TO RESPOND TO WHAT SITUATION MAY ARISE. SO WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT BY HAVING THE FUNDING AND A RESERVE RATHER THAN AS A PART OF A DEPARTMENTS BUDGET. THAT ENABLES US TO HAVE ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND TO BE ABLE TO REACT IN A MUCH MORE TIME EFFICIENT WAY THAN ROUTING THROUGH AN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT WHICH CAN BE A LENGTHY PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE. ALL RIGHT LET'S GO TO ISSUE. THIRTEEN REGARDING THE IMMIGRANT JUSTICE FELLOWSHIP. WE ARE EXPECTING ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOAD IN A GONZALEZ. AND WHEN SHE DOES ARRIVE WILL HAVE HER ADDRESS [inaudible] BOTH ISSUES. I WILL BEGIN WITH JACKIE GONZALEZ POLICY DIRECTOR. THE JUSTICE AND DIVERSITY CENTER OF THE BAR ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRANCISCO'S AT ALL OF ALL THAT ON YOUR BUSINESS CARD YET AND THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE BASED. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RAPID RESPONSE NETWORK IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR IMMIGRANT. JUSTICE. ALL RIGHT THIS GONZALEZ THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THINK YOU MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS CHECKING AND SALAS YOU ALL KNOW THE VARIOUS COLLABORATIVE'S I NOW REPRESENT -- THESE COLLABORATORS OUR NETWORK OF LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FOCUS ON PROVIDING RAPID RESPONSE AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. CALIFORNIA STANDS ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S WAR ON IMMIGRANTS. WERE HOME TO THE MOST ACTIVE BORDER CROSSING IN THE WORLD. AND HOME TO MORE IMMIGRANTS THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY. AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WORD FOR THE COMMITTEE TODAY. THIS IS OUR HOME. IMMIGRANTS READ THE STATE ARE VULNERABLE TO ARBITRARY ARRESTS INHUMANE DETENTION AND DEPORTATION WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. IMMIGRATION IS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX AREAS OF THE LAW. AND I'VE EVER EVOLVING. BUT THOSE IMMIGRANTS WHO FACE DEPORTATION ARE NOT GUARANTEED ACCESS TO COUNSEL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CASES CAN BE YEARS AND THE TENSION FAMILY SEPARATION AND EXILE FROM THIS COUNTRY. THE NEED FOR LEGAL SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE IS MORE URGENT IN THE RURAL REGIONS OF OUR STATE. THOSE PLACES INCLUDE BRIDGES LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE CENTRAL CLOSE. THESE ARE HOME ALSO TO THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF VULNERABLE IMMIGRANTS AND WHERE ICE AGGRESSIVE ISAM FORSMAN ACTIONS ARE MOST AGGRESSIVE. AND TO DEFEND OUR COMMUNITIES WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT IMMIGRATION COURT ROOMS IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE TODAY SO MANY OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STANDALONE ARE TRULY THE FRONT LINES OF THIS BATTLE. THE ONE TIME US THAT WE ARE MAKING IS FOR FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR A PILOT PROGRAM CALLED THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT JUSTICE FELLOWSHIP. IT WOULD PROVIDE THE FIRST STATE SPONSORED FELLOW FELLOW PROGRAM TO INCREASE REMOVAL DEFENSE REPRESENTATION FOR OUR RESIDENTS. IT WOULD INCREASE WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LAW STUDENTS AND YOUNG ATTORNEYS WHO WANT TO GET BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITY AND WORK IN THESE REGIONS OF HIGH NEEDS BUT HAVE NO VIABLE OPTIONS FOR DOING SO. FINALLY IT WOULD EXPAND THE NUMBER OF REPUTABLE LEGAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ELIGIBLE TO PROVIDE THESE CRITICAL SERVICE AND IN THESE REGIONS WERE IMMIGRATION FRIED AND THE THOUGHT HE WAS ARE RAMPANT THIS SERVICE COULD NOT BE MORE NEEDED. TODAY YOU WILL HEAR FROM ORGANIZATIONS WERE EAGER TO LAND THE SUPPORT TO THIS EFFORT AND I HAVE TO SAY AS A DEPORTATION DEFENSE ATTORNEY WHO'S BEEN PRACTICING IN THIS AREA FOR TEN YEARS. IT'S REALLY INSPIRING TO LOOK AROUND AND SEE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THIS ROOM HERE -- WITH ME TODAY. SOME OF THEM TRAINED ME WHEN I WAS A LAW STUDENT AND THERE WAS HALF OF AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY. AT AN ORGANIZATION IN THE BAY AREA TO DATE THAT ORGANIZATION WHICH IS A FORMER EMPLOYER EMPLOYER OF MINE HAS. FORTY FIVE STAFF DEDICATED TO IMMIGRATION. AND THAT'S IN TEN YEARS AND I BELIEVE THAT IF WE INVEST IN A PROGRAM LIKE THIS THAT CAN BE IN A A REALITY IN ALL OF THESE UNDERSERVED REGIONS OF OUR STATE. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE HERE FROM THESE REGIONS CAN BEST SPEAK TO THE NEEDS -- BUT I THINK THE MOST INSPIRING THING IS THAT WE'RE ALL HERE TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP. AND THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS REALLY BEEN WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND -- BOTH FROM THE LEGAL SIDE AND THE COMMUNITY SITE AND ARE READY TO EXECUTE SOMETHING OF THIS MAGNITUDE I THINK CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO MAKE THIS INVESTMENT. AND WE NEED TO BE A LEADER IN THIS AREA WE ALREADY ARE BY THE GENEROUS INVESTMENT THAT'S BEEN MADE A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS BUT FRANKLY THOSE DOLLARS ARE NOT FLOWING TO THESE REGIONS. AND SO THAT IS WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS COMING FROM AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG EVENING AND NIGHT AND I WILL KEEP THESE COMMENTS BRIEF I'M. BECAUSE I WANT THE COMMUNITY TO SPEAK AND ULTIMATELY THE STORIES THAT THEY WILL SHARE WITH YOU TONIGHT ARE WHAT'S BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL SO EVERY RESIDENT OF OUR STATE WE BELIEVE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO DUE PROCESS AND QUALITY REMOVAL DEFENSE SERVICES. AND WE BELIEVE THAT FUNDING THIS FELLOWSHIP IS THE FIRST STEP TO ENSURING CALIFORNIA REMAINS A HOME TO US ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. OUR SALARIES WITH -- DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THE REGIONAL DISPARITIES IN TERMS OF THE CAPACITY OF LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS. TO PROVIDE -- LEGAL SERVICES AROUNDTHE MORE COMPLEX AREAS OF THAT TYPE OF CASES INCLUDING REMOVAL DEFENSE AND ALSO UNDERSTANDS THE IMPACT THAT REMOVAL CAN HAVE ON ON FAMILY SEPARATING FAMILIES OR DENYING. IMMIGRANTS TO DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AND TO THAT END WE HAVE MADE TARGETED INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN REGIONS TO TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE -- SOME OF THESE GAPS INCLUDING PAIRING. LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS IN -- AREAS LIKE THE BAY AREA THAT MAY HAVE MORE EXPERTISE WITH PROVIDERS AND AND RURAL AREAS LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE THEY ARE ATTEMPTING. TO DEVELOP THEIR CAPACITY. THANK YOU NEXT WEEK -- PLEASE. NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME. FRAZIER. THANK YOU. I CAN'T AGREE. WITH YOU MORE ABOUT THE DESPERATE NEED TO PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. ARE WE ALSO A QUITTING HIS THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE NOT FUNDED THE COURTS. AN APPROPRIATE FASHION TO CATCH UP WITH THE DEMAND I'VE CONSTITUENTS. THAT THE WINDOWS CLOSED AT LIKE ONE OR TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON. AND ALSO THE COURTS ARE IMPACTED AS OF THE DEMAND -- ARE WE SURE THAT. AS A PARALLEL THAT WE SHOULD BE FOR FUNDING THE COURTS IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER SO THAT. INDIVIDUALS CAN GET A TIMELY. A JUDICIAL REVIEW OR WHATEVER WHATEVER THE PROCESS IS -- BECAUSE MY JUDGES IN MY DISTRICT. ARE SAYING THE BILL THE FUNDING IS IS A SHORTFALL IN THAT AREA TOO AND WE CAN HAVE MORE OF LEGALLY LEGAL REPRESENTATION. FOR NOT GETTING THEM A TIMELY -- SAYS SEND. THE REPRESENTED BITTER HILL IT'S HIS FOR NOT. SO IS IT HAVE YOU CHECKED IN TO MAKE SURE OF WITH THE COURTS. THAT. WE PUT MORE LOAD ON THEM WITH MORE LEGAL REPRESENTATION THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY. ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE'RE TRYING. TO TRYING TO GET NOW AND AGAIN I WANT THIS TO HAPPEN SURE I MEAN I THINK IN THIS CONTEXT IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE STATE'S PURVIEW TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE COURTS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL. IT'S A FEDERAL COURT -- I I BELIEVE THAT THAT AGENCY HAS SUFFICIENT FUNDING I MEAN THEY THEY THEY NEED MORE ASSISTANCE BUT I THINK -- THE COURTS ARE OPERATING THEIR DEPORTING PEOPLE -- AND THE ISSUE IS NOT -- THAT. THAT THEY NEED MORE FUNDING -- BUT FRANKLY AND IF THAT WERE THE ISSUED IT WOULD BE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE'S. JURISDICTION IN PRAGUE IT'D TO TO FIND A FEDERAL COURT DOES THAT. GOOD ENOUGH TO GET. ONE OF THE AREAS -- THE STATISTICS THAT ARE NOTED WOULD YOU PLEASE SHARE THOSE WITH US. ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE REPRESENTED AND THE MORE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS -- BEING SUCCESSFUL. IN IN STOPPING A DEPORTATION WHETHER YOU'RE REPRESENTED OR NOT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE -- THE A MAKES A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE -- IT'S FIVE YOUR FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO WIN YOUR CASE IF YOU'RE REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY -- AND THAT'S FOR THE NONCE TEEN POPULATION -- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DETAINED I THINK HISTORICALLY NATIONALLY ARE. GET ACCESS TO COUNSELING MAY BE. IT'S BURIED BETWEEN TEN AND 30% -- UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT'S CLOSER 215% NATIONALLY AND WHAT CALIFORNIA LEADS IN A LOT OF WAYS -- THE STATISTICS ARE NOT MUCH BETTER IN CALIFORNIA. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A LACK OF INTEREST I THINK -- AS MYSTERIES NOTED IT'S A VERY COMPLEX AREA OF LAW AND ONE THAT HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN VERY CHALLENGING FOR NON PROFITS -- TO ENGAGE AND IN THE IN THE EARLIER COMICS MYSTERIES I APPRECIATED THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IT WAS IN THE EARLIER ISSUE. BUT EXPANDING INTO THE INLAND EMPIRE AND I THINK WHEN I LOOK AT A A A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS. I LOVE IT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO SERVE. SO MANY PEOPLE -- AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND OF COURSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THAT I WOULD ADVOCATE. FOR BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT THE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. WE NEED THIS. TO WE DON'T HAVE A LAW SCHOOL SO WE DON'T HAVE A THE PERFECT FEED FOR FOR SUCH A PILOT PROJECT. WE HAVE LAW SCHOOLS IN LOS ANGELES. BUT IT JUST WOULDN'T BE THE SAME I SEE ONE OF THE ADVOCATES FROM SHE LINED CERTAINLY WE WOULD WORK WITH THEM TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO BUT EIGHT THE THE THESE PILOT PROJECTS. ARE IMPORTANT BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE HOW WE EXPAND THEM -- OF COURSE IT'LL COST MORE MONEY BUT TO EXPAND INTO OTHER AREAS LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE. ONLY BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO BE THE ONE SITTING HERE BUT MY COLLEAGUES WOULD TALK ABOUT AN ADVOCATE FOR THEIR VERY AREAS AS WELL. SO THAT IT IT'S MORE THAN JUST ONE AREA. IN THE BAY AREA THAT IT INCLUDES OTHER AREAS YES AND IF I COULD SPEAK BRIEFLY TO THAT -- MADAM CHAIR -- I DON'T AGREE 1100% AND WHAT'S BEEN PUT FORTH AS A PILOT FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH I WILL JUST KNOW IS. THE JURISDICTION OF THE SAN FRANCISCO IMMIGRATION COURT IS AS FAR NORTH AS THE OREGON BORDER AS FAR SOUTH AS BAKERSFIELD SO THIS PROPOSAL THE EXPERTISE WOULD BE COMING OUT OF THE BAY AREA AND THE SERVICES WOULD BE IN THAT ENTIRE GEOGRAPHIC REGION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO BUILD CAPACITY -- TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE INLAND EMPIRE THE OTHER REGIONS WE HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE CONVERSATIONS -- WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS THE VERY FEW AND ALSO A COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN YOUR IF YOU THAT THAT WAS YOU SAID THAT YEAH WE THE ONE YEAH WE HAVE ARE SO DEDICATED YEAH LIKE EMILIO AND RUSSELL AND THE OTHERS THERE SO SO DEDICATED. AND I APPRECIATE ALL THAT THEY DO BUT THEY COULD SURE USE SOME HELP YES AND I THIS. I TRUST THAT THE MODEL WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD IS ONE THAT COULD BE EASILY SCALE TO HELP AND REPLICABLE IN THESE REGIONS -- WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH THESE VARIOUS REGIONS -- THERE'S AN ADDENDUM TO THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU'LL NOTE ACTUALLY HAS A SUMMARY FOR THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THIS KIND OF URBAN ROLE DIVIDE -- AND AND THE NEED TO STATE THAT YOU SO RIGHTLY POINT OUT -- IT'S A QUESTION OF OF MONEY AND CAPACITY THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN WRITTEN FOR THE REGION WE KNOW BEST -- BUT BY ADVOCATE SAID THE WHAT BEST BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF TENANTS TO IT THAT APPLY VERY EASILY. IN OTHER PARTS OF OF THE STATE. WONDERFUL WELL. THANK YOU FOR FOR THIS PROPOSAL I I JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN SAYING THAT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED WE NEED TO TRAIN. THE TRAINERS SO THAT WE CAN. HAVE AS MANY -- AS MANY OF OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN DETENTION REPRESENTED BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IS THE GREATEST SUCCESS RATE. IS WHEN YOU ARE REPRESENTED.

ON BEFORE I HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LET YOU KNOW LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I'M HERE TO REQUEST AT THE STATE BUDGET INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION BE ON THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S PROPOSED TWENTY MILLION. FOR IMMIGRATION RAPID RESPONSE THE DIGITAL FUNDING WILL SUPPLEMENT NECESSARY MEDICAL SERVICES IN PERSON ALL THE PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN PROVIDING DALY MEDICAL SCREEN FOR ARRIVING MIGRANTS AND ASYLUM SEEKERS. WHILE THIS. SHELTER IS IN SAN DIEGO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS A STATE STATEWIDE ISSUE IT IS THE FIRST SPOT FOR THE MIGRANTS TO GET HEALTH CARE NO MATTER WHERE THEY'RE GOING AND MOST OF THEM VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE NOT STAYING IN SAN DIEGO. SO IT AFFECTS OUR ENTIRE STATE THE JEWISH FAMILY SERVICES OF SAN DIEGO PROVIDES A VARIETY OF SERVICES THROUGH THE SAN DIEGO RAPID RESPONSE NETWORK INCLUDING SHELTER OPERATIONS. A CRITICAL COMPONENT A SHELTER OPERATIONS INCLUDE HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THESE ASYLUM SEEKING FAMILIES THE MEDIA NEEDS HEALTH CARE SERVICES OUR CENTRAL CORE ELEMENT OF THE SHELTER OPERATION.

THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS BY PROVIDING MEDICAL PERSONNEL AND CONTRACTED AGENTS TO CONDUCT MEDICAL STRICT GREENS AN INTAKE. HOWEVER THE COUNTY DOES NOT HAVE ANY BUDGET AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE PROVIDING THE SERVICES PAST JULY FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE LOSS OF THOSE SERVICES WILL HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON THE HEALTH OF ARRIVING MIGRANTS AND AS A RESULT ON THE HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA. THE LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS RECOGNIZES NEED FOR SHELTER TO CONTINUE OPERATING CRITICAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR MY GRANTS FOR THIS REASON.

THIRTEEN IN MY ROLE THAT KIND A SEE THE HIGH DEMAND FOR LEGAL SERVICES KIND IS AN EXPERT AT REPRESENTING UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN. HOWEVER WE OFTEN GET REFERRALS FROM THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO WE ARE UNABLE TO SERVE. I ALSO SEE THE INSTABILITY THAT THE ADULT CARETAKERS WHO ARE IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE. THE FRESNO COUNTY LEGAL DEFENSE FUND HAS SECURED PRIVATE FUNDING TO PROVIDE REMOVAL DEFENSE BUT WE HAVE NO NONPROFIT ATTORNEY WITH A LICENSED IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY TO PLACE CASES WITH.

TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FOURTEEN IN THAT REGION THERE WERE ONLY EIGHT OR NINE I CREDIT THE REPRESENTATIVES -- BUT CAPACITY HAS IMPROVED SINCE THEN THEY'RE NOT ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY A GREAT THE REPS. BUT HIS MOTHER DOES NOT SURE RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE MAJOR ARE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE IN THE CENTER BY THE STILL TODAY. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE IMPROVE THE CAPACITY TO HELP PEOPLE WITH DOCTOR WITH NATURAL SESSION. WE DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ASSIST PEOPLE WITH LEGAL DEFENSE.

BUT WE HEAR THOSE STORIES ALL THE TIME WE ORGANIZE HUNDREDS OF WORKSHOPS -- SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN LAST YEAR ALONE HUNTER AND SEVEN WORKSHOPS IN THE REGION. IN COLLABORATION WITH ANY PARTNERS AND IN THOSE WITH WORKSHOPS WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING IN SICK IN THAT TYPE OF ASSISTANCE WE CANNOT A SYSTEM. THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE AND WITH THIS OUR PIPELINE PROJECT HAS BEEN CREATED WE'RE DEVELOPING IS A VERY STRONG PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN.

FROM PROVIDING -- ADMINISTRATIVE KIND OF AFFIRMATIVE CASE ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDING FULL SCOPE SERVICES TO OUR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES IN THE REGION. THE ATTACKS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES LEAVE THE COMMUNITIES VULNERABLE -- IN A COUPLE OF WAYS ESPECIALLY IN OUR UNDERSERVED REGIONS THEY'RE VULNERABLE NOT ONLY TO IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT BUT ALSO TO IMMIGRATION FRAUD WHICH IS VERY PREVALENT IN OUR IN OUR REGION.

FIFTEEN ALL RIGHT LET'S GET BACK TO ISSUE [inaudible] FOURTEEN ALL RIGHT. LET'S BEGIN WITH. LOW THE ON FOR WEEKS YES. I WAS GONNA SAY GOOD AFTERNOON BUT IT'S MORE LIKE A NIGHT. MY NAME IS LAW THAT ROYCE AND I'M THE FOSTER CARE BRIDGE MANAGER FOR THE YMCA OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. CHILD CARE RESOURCE SERVICE CHAIR LATEST AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE. TO REPRESENT THE DOZENS OF COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA CORY NEED OF AN INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE MERGING SEE CHILD CARE BRIDGE PROGRAM FOR FOSTER CHILDREN. GET THE COMMITMENT YOU MADE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO CREATE THIS PROGRAM. IS TRANSFORMING THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR REFORMING THE SYSTEM FOR OUR YOUNGEST CALIFORNIANS WHOSE VOICES ARE OFTEN NOT HEARD. BUT ARE OFTEN REPRESENTED BY NEGATIVE STATISTICS. THIS PROPOSAL IS ASKING TO GROW THE EXISTING PROGRAM BY PROVIDING THIRTY EIGHT MILLION TO EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL VOUCHERS TO CHILDREN IN CARE. FIVE MILLION TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL NAVIGATORS WHO ARE WORKING TO FIND CHILD CARE FOR FOSTER CHILDREN. AND FOUR MILLION TO DELIVER ADDITIONAL TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. AS A CARE FOR FOSTER CHILDREN IN THEIR LOCAL EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS. THE INTENTIONAL HIGH QUALITY COLLABORATION BETWEEN RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES AND CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. IS WORKING TO THE BENEFIT OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH. SINCE THE START OF OUR FISCAL YEAR WE HAVE SIR TWO HUNDRED AND NINE FOSTER CHILDREN WITH CHILD CARE NAVIGATION. TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE VOUCHER PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED THROUGH FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE'VE TRAIN A TOTAL SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN TRAUMA INFORMED TRAININGS. AND PROVIDED ONE ON ONE TRAUMA INFORMED COACHING TO A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. WITH ADDITIONAL PROPOSE FUNDING TO SUPPORT GREATER NAVIGATION AND TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING FOR PROVIDERS MORE CHILDREN AND MORE PROVIDERS WILL BE SERVED COUNTY WIDE. THIS MEANS MORE STABLE AND CONSISTENT CARE. PROVIDERS ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO CARE FOR THESE CHILDREN. FOSTER PARENTS INCLUDING RELATIVE CARE GIVER STRUGGLING TO ACCESS CHILD CARE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A CHILD'S PLACEMENT IN THEIR HOME. FOSTER PARENTS ESPECIALLY CAN CARE GIVERS OFTEN GET LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO RANGE FOR QUALITY CHILD CARE. THIS MEANS THAT CARE GIVERS WHO WORK OR ARE IN SCHOOL CANNOT TAKE IN A CHILD WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTING THEIR LIVES OR PUTTING THEIR FAMILY IN FINANCIAL JEOPARDY. THE BRIDGE BELIEVES THIS BARRIER. TRAINING FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN TRAUMA INFORMED CARE THROUGH THE **** BRIDGE PROGRAM HAS BEEN CRITICAL BECAUSE OF THE MANY ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. THESE CHILDREN LIVE WITH. ONE PROVIDER WE WORKED WITH COMMENTED AFTER RECEIVING TRAINING AND COACHING WE GOT STRAIGHT INTO ACTION IMPLEMENTING SOME OF YOUR IDEAS THEY HAVE REALLY HELPED. SHE SEEMS BACK TO HER NORMAL SELF AND ALL HER PREVIOUS FRIENDSHIPS AT SCHOOL WOULD HAVE BEEN RESTORED. SHE WENT ON TO ADD OUR OTHER FOSTER KID -- HAD A REALLY ROUGH TWO WEEK PERIOD FOLLOWING HER COURT DATE BUT I WAS PREPARED FOR IT THIS TIME AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET HER SETTLED DOWN QUICKLY. IN PREPARING AND PROVIDING THE SUPPORT TO OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WE ARE EMPOWERING THEM TO NURTURE THESE LITTLE ONES. WHO MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED SUCH HARDSHIPS IN WAYS THAT CAN HAVE LASTING EFFECTS? ON A CHILD'S LONG TERM WELL BEING. IN MOVING FORWARD WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSIDER INCLUDING THIS BUDGET AUGMENTATION REQUEST THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LIKE SPEAKER. CAN JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AT JUST SEE THINGS IN TERMS OF THE AGENDA. WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THE EXPANSION INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL -- BUT OBVIOUSLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE JUST AB MENTION IN SUCCESS STORIES THAT ARE HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE STATE IT'S IT'S REALLY AT FEELING GREAT AND MET NEED APPRECIATE THE WORK THERE -- IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE PROPOSAL -- THAT WE JUST HEARD THE ONE THING THAT WE WOULD SAY IS THAT WE ARE WE ARE STILL IN EARLY INFANCY EVER THE BRIDGE PROGRAM. AT A STAGE WHERE WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN WHETHER OR NOT THE BRIDGE TO THE OTHER CHILDCARE SUBSIDY SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY WORKING SO WE WANT TO BEFORE I THINK -- CODIFYING EVERY DAY AT REJECTION TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE DOCTOR CAN BE UTILIZED WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE SOME DATA THE INFLUENCE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A SUBSIDY THERE -- TO SUPPORT THAT TRANSITION. ALSO ON YOUR AGENDA AT POINTS OUT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. ADD THIS WOULD BRING THE BRIDGE AT CONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER CHILD CARE STEPS THE VOUCHER PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. TO ENSURE THAT ANY EXAM PROVIDERS PROVIDING CHILDCARE THROUGH THE BRIDGE INITIATIVE ARE RECEIVING THE BACKGROUND CHECK THROUGH THE TRUST LINE PROCESS. AND THAT THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH GETTING FINGERPRINTED AND GOING TO THAT PROCESS COULD BE REIMBURSED AND THAT'S IS ACTUALLY AT NO COST WE BELIEVE THE EXISTING RESOURCES. COULD AT COULD YOU LET BE UTILIZED HERE FOR THIS AT SPECIFIC PROGRAM. THANK YOU. LIKE SPEAKER. JUST THE GREATEST BERMAN OF FINANCE -- AT THE SAME -- WITH REGARDS THE ADVOCATES -- PROPOSAL WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION -- AND THEN JUST A GUARD THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY SUPPORT OF THE TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

AND HELP MILLIONS MORE. AND I MIGHT ADD HELP A LOT OF THE SOCIAL WORKERS WHO ARE PART OF THE ADVOCATES YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THAT WE WORK WITH THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MY NAME IS BENITO DELGADO WILSON AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SUPPLY BANK DOT ORG IT'S AN ORGANIZATION WE CREATED UC BERKELEY SOME TEN YEARS AGO AS A STUDENT GROUP AS PART OF AN A. S. YOU SEE. AN INITIATIVE. IT'S BASICALLY WHAT YOU WOULD THINK OF AS A REGIONAL FOOD BANK BUT FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT FOOD. A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY WOULD BE HELPFUL WITH THE CONTEXT OF THIS. PRIOR TO NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN THE SAME WAY THAT -- CODE DRIVES BACKPACK DRIVES DIAPER DRIVES ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT AND I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE VOLUNTEERED ON I KNOW SOME OF YOU WHO VOLUNTEERED ON QUITE WELL. IS EXACTLY HOW WE TREATED HUNGER IN THE UNITED STATES WAS JUST VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS. BUT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN A FORMER BUSINESSMAN IN PHOENIX ARIZONA THOUGHT WELL WHAT IF WE CENTRALIZED ALL OF THIS GIVING FROM FARMERS AND FOOD PRODUCERS INTO ONE CENTRAL HUB. IN PUT ALL THOSE RESOURCES OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY YOUR SOUP KITCHENS YOUR FOOD PANTRIES YOUR CHURCHES. AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THEY'RE DOING THE HARD WORK ON THE FRONT LINES EVERYDAY FEEDING PEOPLE AND PROVIDING THEM WITH GROCERIES TO ALLEVIATE HUNGER. IT WAS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN TEN YEARS LATER THE UNITED STATES WAS FUNDING EIGHTEEN REGIONAL FOOD BANKS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE QUITE SIMILAR TO THAT WE ARE NO WHERE NEAR THAT SCALE WE'RE VERY HUMBLING COMPARISON. BUT WE DO WORK WITH FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN CLINICS FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS. CAL WORKS COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS HOME VISITATION PROGRAMS. ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT OF OUR FIRST -- FIVE COUNTY COMMISSIONS AS WELL AS SEVERAL STATE AGENCIES AND INCLUDE SOME OF THEM HERE TODAY AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT WE WORK WITH ALL ACROSS THE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE APPARATUS IN CALIFORNIA. WE TAKE THESE MATERIALS AND SEND THEM OUT THROUGH EXISTING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE PATHWAYS OUT OF POVERTY FOR THESE PEOPLE. TO IMPROVE THEIR RELATIONSHIPS THEY HAVE ALSO TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE BASIC NEED THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED AN OTHERWISE WILL LIKELY GO WITHOUT. WE'VE HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE OVER THE YEARS SEVERAL EFFORTS AROUND MANY OF WHICH WE ARE VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT AROUND DIAPER NEED. IS WELL AS MANY OTHER -- VERY MERITORIOUS EFFORTS WHERE I'D MET OUR HUMBLE IN COMPARISON TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE HEARD TALKED ABOUT HERE TODAY. BUT VERY IMPORTANT. TWO WEEKS AGO MY STAFF AND I WERE IN WASHINGTON DC AND ONE OF MY STAFF MEMBERS WHO IS HERE TODAY PARTICIPATE IN THE NATIONAL DIAPER BANK NETWORK. LOBBY DAY ALONG WITH SOME OF THE OTHER ADVOCATES YOU'VE HEARD TODAY. IN I THINK THEY SAY IT BEST WHEN THEY SAY THAT BASIC NEEDS ARE NOT BASIC. IMAGINE GOING THROUGH YOUR DAY WITHOUT HAVING SHAMPOO OR DEODORANT OR DENTAL HYGIENE KIT OR BEING A KID IN SCHOOL ABOUT SCHOOL SUPPLIES WERE BEING A MOTHER WHO CAN'T PROVIDE DIAPERS FOR HER BABY. THESE ARE ALL THE STRUGGLES THAT THEY FACE EVERY SINGLE DAY. BUT WE'RE DOING IT THE SAME WAY WE DID IT WITH FOOD FIFTY YEARS AGO BUT WE CAN DO BETTER. SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS INITIALLY WAS SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND HYGIENE KITS WE'VE EXPANDED WE'VE CREATED -- THE BABY BRAND WITH OUR OUR STATE CHILDREN FAMILIES COMMISSION A LOT OF THE LOCAL AFFILIATES BUT WE ALSO MANUFACTURE STATIONARY AND HYGIENE ITEMS AND LAPTOPS. FOR OUR CLIENTS IN SCHOOLS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE REALLY QUITE FUNDING CREATIVE YOU LEARN A LOT. BUT IT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT IS NEEDED IS A CENTRALIZED FACILITY AND THIS ISN'T MY CONCLUSION WE PUT TOGETHER. A PANEL OF EXPERTS THAT INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES OF SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES COUNTY SUPERVISORS. PHILANTHROPIC LEADERS FROM THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IS WELL AS LOGISTICS EXPERTS BECAUSE THAT'S A BIG PART OF WHAT THIS IS. AND JUST LIKE IT WAS THE KEY IN THE CATALYST IN PHOENIX ARIZONA SOME FIFTY YEARS AGO. THE CATALYST FOR A SUPPLY BANK IN CALIFORNIA. IS A BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITY WHERE YOU CAN CENTRALIZE RESOURCES YOU CAN SCALE PROGRAMS YOU CAN REDUCE THREE PL SORRY AB PRIVATE LOGISTICS AND WAREHOUSING COST. IS WELL AS OTHER THINGS BUT ALSO CENTRALIZED THE PHILANTHROPY IN THE GOODNESS THAT'S AND EVERYBODY. I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THERE PEOPLE WHO MAY ON A CONTRACTING BUSINESS AND GET SIXTEEN TRUCKS AND DELIVER SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND HYGIENE KITS STOKELY IN BRENTWOOD IF I ASK THEM. TO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE VOLUNTEERS FROM COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS WHO WILL SHOW UP EVERY DAY AND VOLUNTEER JUST LIKE THEY DO WITH FOOD BACKS. AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE SOME OF MY BEST MENTORS ARE THE CEO OF OUR LOCAL FOOD BANK ALAMEDA COUNTY WHICH RANKED NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION. AND OTHERS FROM SAN DIEGO WERE INCREDIBLY INNOVATIVE AND DOING AMAZING THINGS AND OTHERS THAT WE'VE TALKED TO ENGAGE WITH ACROSS THE STATE. SO I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TO BE A PARTNER. FOR WHAT WE THINK PHILANTHROPY WILL FILL THE REST OF THE GAP OF THE PROPOSALS FOR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THREE MILLION OF IT MATCHES WHAT IS ALREADY BEEN CONTRIBUTED BY TWO ORGANIZATIONS IN THE BAY AREA. ONE MILLION IS FOR COMMERCIAL GRADE AND FIRE RESISTANT STORAGE SHEDS FOR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY PARTNERS AROUND THE STATE. THAT'S BASICALLY SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH MORE MATERIALS AND HAVE LESS DELIVERIES. BUT IT'S ALSO THERE'S A DISASTER RELIEF COMPONENT OF THIS. ONE ADVOCATES HERE COULD PROBABLY DESCRIBE MUCH BETTER THAN I COULD HELP POVERTY IS A DISASTER AND IT'S AN ONGOING CRISIS BUT WE'RE ALSO ALL FAMILIAR. WITH THE RECENT DISASTERS IN PARADISE IN SANTA ROSA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS FLOODING AND OTHER SMALL TIME DISASTERS SUCH AS AN APARTMENT BUILDING FIRE OR A LOCAL CREEK FLOOD IT DISPLACES FAMILIES. WHILE POWELL YES I WOULD SAY HAS DONE AN AMAZING AND SUPERB JOB OF COORDINATING THE NGOS THROUGH NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THE RED CROSS DOES HAVE SOME INFRASTRUCTURE OF WAREHOUSING. WORKING WITH THEM AND HAVING MY PROGRAMS TEAM WORK WITH THEM THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL GAPS. A SMALL FIRE THAT DISPLACES TEN FAMILIES AN APARTMENT BUILDING IS IT GOING TO MAKE THE NEWS LIKE A REGIONAL DISASTER THAT IMPACTS ALL OF US IN PARADISE WOOD. BUT THOSE TEN FAMILY STILL NEED THEIR BASIC NEEDS TO BE MET WHILE THEY'RE AT A SHELTER THAT THE RED CROSS PROVIDE. THIS IS THE GAP THAT SUPPLY BANK DOT ORG CAN FILL. I WANT YOU TO THINK OF LIKE ALL THESE HOME VISITATION PROGRAMS THE REASON WHY WE SPOKE ABOUT THAT BEFORE. IS MY PROGRAMS TEAM HAS MET WITH EVERY CHILDREN FAMILIES COMMISSION IN THE STATE MINUS A FEW WHICH ARE SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER DINO NEXT WEEK TO BEST MEET WITH -- MISS SCOTT. AND A NUMBER OF THEM ARE PROVIDING THAT SERVICE IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WHEN WE HEAR THAT WERE THEIR EXPANDING THE DIAPER CAN'T PROGRAMMER ASKING WELL HOW DO WE DO THIS IN YOUR COUNTY. THEY SAY THE HOME VISITATION PROGRAM OR WICK OR NOW FOR SEE BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT WILL STRENGTHEN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. SAME THING WITH SCHOOLS WE WORK WITH BRENDA DADDY WHO RUNS THE HOMELESS PROGRAM THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS AND ALL OF HER. AMAZING PARTNERS IN RIALTO AND SAMBAR NEAR UNIFIED ALL THE WAY OUT INTO BARSTOW ALL OF THESE FOLKS. NEED THESE MATERIALS SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE WHAT'S IMMEDIATELY NEEDED TO THEIR CLIENTS AND THEN GET INTO THE DEEPER AND HARDER ON GOING WORK THAT ALL OF THE ADVOCATES HERE TODAY HAVE SO ELOQUENTLY. STATED OUR NEED OF RESOURCES AS WELL. SO THAT'S THE BACKGROUND ON OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL AND I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER. ALL RIGHTS -- YES. I KNOW LOSING TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY WITH THESE TRUCKS AND WILLING TO MAKE OF THOSE TRIPS. YOU KNOW I'VE KNOWN THIS YOUNG MAN FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND WHEN HE CAME OUT OF BERKELEY AND HAD AN IDEA. AND IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT A SOCIAL SAFETY NET THAT ACTUALLY HAS IMPACT. AND LEVERAGES PHILANTHROPY JUST THROUGH INSPIRATION ALONE AFTER THE EFFORT SAID. HIS GROUP HAS GONE. AN ACCOMPLISHED AS YOU MENTIONED THE BACKPACK PROGRAM. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF FOR THE KIDS IN NEED -- IN THE SCHOOLS. BUT THIS IS ADVANCED WITH IT ANOTHER CONCEPT. AND I THINK THAT IS IMPAIR OF NO -- I KNOW THAT MR BONTA. FULLY SUPPORTS THIS BUT I AFTER ALSO STE SHARE MY SUPPORT AND SEEN. WHAT THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED? IN THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAT THEY'VE HAD THIS COMPARATIVELY TO OTHER LARGE ORGANIZATIONS. BUT WHAT A FULL FILLS IN AGAIN. THE GAP THAT IS PROVIDED THAT WE AS A STATE CANNOT PROVIDE. IS ESSENTIAL THESE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING THIS EFFORT IN THAT WE SUPPORT THIS GOING FORWARD -- THE MIRACLES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED. THE APARTMENT FIRES THE OF JUST THE NEEDS ONE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CALL AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A FAMILY IN NEED. THE GAP IS FILLED [inaudible] RESPONSIVE. THOUGHTFUL. COMPASSIONATE. BUT ALSO. HIS SENSUAL AND I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS ORGANIZATION. SAW WAS GRASSROOTS HAS GROWN I'M VERY PROUD OF THIS MAN. AND HIS ORGANIZATION AND I WHOLE HEARTEDLY HOUSE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT THEM AND HELP THEM GROW THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. YOU CAN TELL MISTER BONTA IT WAS OKAY HE WASN'T HERE. OKAY BECAUSE YOU HAD ANOTHER STUMBLING MEMBER WHO WAS JUST AS PASSIONATE I WILL LET HIM KNOW THAT I HAVE BETTER AIR NEEDS IS -- THAT'S COMING FROM HIM I SAID NOTHING OF THE SORT. WELL I THANK YOU SO MUCH -- ALL RIGHT ISSUE NUMBER. SEVENTEEN AND I WILL NOTE THAT THIS IS THE LAST ISSUE. AND ON OUR AGENDA. THE LAST STORE. IT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THEIR FIRST DAY ISSUE. THAT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT WE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HELP SEND THEM THE LONG DAY AND EVENING WE'VE HAD SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN AND ASSEMBLYMAN FRAZIER -- FOR HEARING US TODAY TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO INVEST IN ACTUALLY STRENGTHENING FAMILIES IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING THAT PARENTS IN ON THIS IS LAST. WE ARE THE OLDEST CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND FAMILY STRENGTH NEW ORGANIZATION FOUNDED IN CALIFORNIA FIFTY YEARS AGO LAST MONTH. AND WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT WHAT EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT TODAY WITH THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT FAMILIES HOUSE SUPPORT -- PARENTS IN PARTICULAR. IT'S TIMELY THAT MAYBE WERE LAST. SO WE ARE ASKING FOR IS A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN EVIDENCE BASED PARENTS ANONYMOUS SERVICES AND THAT INCLUDES. THE ONLY EVIDENCE BASED PARENT PARTNER PROGRAM IN THE STATE OR IN THIS COUNTRY THAT INCLUDES A WEEKLY SUPPORT GROUP FOR PARENTS CHILDREN AND YOUTH NO MATTER WHAT THEIR ISSUE ARTS WHETHER THEY'RE AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY WITH THEIR GRAMMA RAISING A CHILD WITH THE CHILD HAS ADHD. WHETHER STRUGGLING BECAUSE THEY LOST A JOB THEY CAN COME TO PARENTS RAMIS WEEKLY SUPPORT GROUP ON AN ONGOING BASIS IT'S CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE THIS COMMUNITY BASED. AND IT IS EVIDENT SPACE I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE RESEARCH. IN ADDITION WE OPERATE THE ONLY PARENT HELP LINE IN THE STATE WHERE PARENTS ARE CRYING OUT FOR HELP. THEY WHEN THEY CALL US THEY SAY THANK GOD WE HAVE A HUMAN BEING TO TALK TO BECAUSE I HAVE NOBODY TO TURN. TO I NEED TO CALL YOU BEFORE I TALKED TO MY DAUGHTER WHO WENT ON A JOY RIDE WITH MY FOUR YEAR OLD WE HAVE PARENTS CALLING IN CRISIS THAT THEIR CHILD IS SUICIDAL. AND THE SCHOOL ACTUALLY SENT THE CHILD HOME IS THAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S SERIOUS AND THEY NEEDED TO PROCESS WHAT THEY NEED TO NEXT WHICH IS GO TO THE GROUP. THEN THEY WENT TO THE PARENTS ON THIS GROUP THEY TALKED THE HEALTH PLAN ADVOCATES IS A TRUE STORY FOR A MONTH AGO. AND THEY SAY THAT CHILD'S LIFE BECAUSE A GROUP SUPPORTED THEM IN GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHEN YOU GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IN CALIFORNIA. AND YOUR CHILD A SUICIDAL YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED TO CHILD WELFARE AND INVESTIGATED. AND THE PARENTS SAID MY CHILD SAFETY IS MORE IMPORTANT HE'S ELEVEN YEARS OLD HE'S NEVER EXPRESSED ANY DESIRE TO KILL HIMSELF. SHE SUSPECTED IT WAS IS ADHD MEDICATION THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED THE GROUP CAME TOGETHER AS COMMUNITY FOR HER. AND TOOK HER OTHER MINOR CHILDREN HOME MAKE SURE THEY WERE CARE FOR SHE WAS FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM BEFORE SHE WAS. TRANSFERRED TO CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ORANGE COUNTY THE CHILD WAS REMOVED THE MEDICATION STABILIZE ITS CENTER AND HE SOLD ALL THE THERAPISTS THERE ALREADY IN HOW TO MEDITATE BECAUSE THEY GO TO PARENTS ANONYMOUS EVERY WEEK. WE USE ONLY EVIDENCE BASED SERVICES AND THAT'S A TRUE STORY. WHAT DOES THE RESEARCH SAY WHAT WE KNOW THAT THE? WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION FOR YOU -- ABOUT THAT WE HAVE THE RATE OF CHILD ABUSE IN OUR STATE IS RELATIVELY HIGH WE KNOW THE LONG TERM COSTS NOT ONLY ON OUR BODY AND OUR BEING. BUT ON THE ABILITY FOR FAMILIES TO THRIVE AND CONTRIBUTE THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY TALKED ABOUT HIS REASON TO HAVE DEVELOPED INCREASED DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING WAS IT HIS MOTHER. HIS OWN MOTHER COULD NOT GET HELP FOR HIM HE WAS IN FIFTH GRADE. AND HE SUFFER FROM DYSLEXIA. HIS ONLY FIFTY ONE YEARS OLD SO THAT WAS ONLY FORTY YEARS AGO THAT THEY WERE STILL STRUGGLING AND THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IT AND PARENTS ARE SHARING THEIR STORIES. HOW CAN I GET HELP HOW CAN I ASK THIS HELP WHERE CAN I TURN? WE HAVE PEOPLE CALLING WHO SAY I HAVE NO ONE TO TALK TO I'M TOO EMBARRASSED TO TELL MY FRIENDS. YOU PARENTING IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE COOKING IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK EVERY TIME EVERY TIME YOU FOLLOW THE RECIPE. THERE'S SO MUCH BLAME AND SHAME OUT THERE FOR PARENTS. WE ARE TOTALLY FIFTY YEARS AGO BORN BY A PARENT AND SOCIAL WORKER. WE HELP PASS FEDERAL LEGISLATION WE EXISTED BEFORE THEY WERE FEDERAL LAWS PARENTS NOMS HAS THE TOTAL LEGACY. THE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT WE MEDICAID ASUS YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH ADVERSE CHILD EXPERIENCES WELL IN INVESTMENT IN PARENTS NOMOS IS SAVING US FROM. MAJOR HEALTH ISSUES MAJOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND ANY RISKY BEHAVIOR WE HAVE AS ADULTS. BECAUSE IF WE CAN INTERRUPT BY BUILDING THE RESILIENCE OF PARENTS WE CAN [inaudible] STOP. THIS HEMORRHAGING OF WHAT'S GOING ON SO PARENTS BECOME pCHILDHOOD I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDED THEY'RE GOING TO BE YOU SCREENING OF EVERY CHILD IN EVERY ADULT. WHO RECEIVES MEDICARE OUT IN THE STATE MY ISSUE IS ONCE YOU FIND OUT YOU HAVE ASUS AND WITH CHILDREN WERE PREVENTING FUTURE ACES WHICH RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES ON PARENTS ANONYMOUS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO HELP PEOPLE? SO BECOMING AWARE THAT YOU HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEM WE NEED TO WORK WITH PARENTS TO SUPPORT THEM SO THEY CAN HELP ADDRESS THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEM THE CHILD HAS. NOT LEAVE THEM ON THE STREET CORNERS OKAY YOUR CHILD OR IS TWO ACES THEIR RISK FOR THESE PROBLEMS YOUR CHILD HAS ADHD OR YOUR CHILD HAS A CONDUCT DISORDER. THE PARENT IS SITTING THERE SAYING WHAT DOES THIS MEAN HOW CAN YOU HELP ME WHAT'S GOING ON AND THERE ARE SYSTEMS OUT THERE BUT THE OVERALL HELP. REALLY COME THROUGH THE IDEA THE PEOPLE PICK UP THE PHONE AND THEY ASK FOR HELP WHICH WE CONSIDER TO BE A SIGN OF STRENGTH AND POWER. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER. VERY GOOD. WE LEFT YOUR WHOLE PICTURE HERE FOR A FROM US TO EXPLAIN THINGS AND SOME OTHER DOCUMENTS. KIDS WERE IN THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE BASED CLEARING HOUSE WITH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES CREATED TEN YEARS AGO WE ARE THE ONLY PARENT PARTNER PROGRAM. WITH RESEARCH THAT'S WHAT WE THINK YOUR HUSBAND'S WORTH WHILE YES. AND AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR HAVING CA I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE. TO COLLABORATE WITH YOU. LAST YEAR I HAD A BILL PASSED -- THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS TO TEACH. SCHOOLS HAVE TO TEACH APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR -- TO STEM. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR AND DATING. FOR ABUSE. ALSO. THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO. THIRTEEN SIXTY NINE WAS THE FIRST TO SIT DYSLEXIA BILL -- THAT REQUIRES OF PHONOLOGICAL SCREENING IN ALL SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS WOULD LIKE. TO GET YOU COMBINED WITH SOME OF THESE GROUPS THAT I WORKED WITH ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE ADVOCATES. THEY CAN BE PUT ON THE GROUND BECAUSE WHAT I'M FINDING OUT IS THERE'S A LACK OF PROVIDERS. THAT WILL YOU CAN YOU CAN BE AN ADVOCATE BUT TO GET THE PEOPLE OF THE PARENTS. CHILDREN TO THE THE APPROPRIATE. INDIVIDUALS TO GET THEM THE THE THERAPY OR WHATEVER THE PROCESS IS. A WE DON'T HAVE THE PROVIDERS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE HEEL THE LARGE AMOUNT OF OF NEED IN IN THE STUDENT POPULATION. BUT LOVE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU AND WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU PARENT LEADERSHIP IS THE CORNERSTONE OF PARENTS SOME MYSTERY RUN THE ONLY NATIONAL CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FOR PARENT LEADERS IN THE COUNTRY. AND PARENTS WHAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THEIR OWN LIVED EXPERIENCE WANT TO HELP ANOTHER PERSON BE AN ADVOCATE NOT. OKAY YOU JUST TOLD ME THIS DIAGNOSIS -- OVERWHELM WHAT TO DO AND STANDING UP FOR WHAT YOU NEED IS SO IMPORTANT SO WE WOULD LOVE TO PARTNER WITH THOSE ENTITIES. FOR SCHOOLS AND WE WORK WITH HUNDREDS OF PARTNERS BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS ARE CALLING US ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE ARE CALLING IS HOW CAN WE GIVE THEM YOUR NUMBER WE CAN'T MEET THE DEMAND. WE HAVE TWENTY TWO MILLION PARENTS IN CALIFORNIA YOU ADD THAT TO THE NINE MILLION CHILDREN THIRTY ONE MILLION PEOPLE AT MINIMUM OF THE STATE OR WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT A FACT MAY CALL THE HELPLINE. ON BEHALF OF THOSE NINE MILLION CHILDREN THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT. THE CARE OF RELATIVE PROVIDERS BECAUSE THE CENSUS BUREAU DOES NOT COUNT THOSE NUMBERS SAYS ESTIMATES ARE VERY VERY HIGH. AND HAVING A HELP LINE IT'S A BASIC THING. WHY CAN'T PEOPLE REACH OUT AND SAY I'M STRUGGLING I'M A CRISIS YOUR SCHOOL JUST TOLD ME THIS I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WITH ADHD MEANS WHAT WHAT WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHERE DO I GO? MY OWN FEELINGS MIGHT BE IN THE WAY AND PARENTS TALK ABOUT THAT AND MY IN THE WAY OF MY KIDS GETTING THE HELP ONCE I HEAR THEY NEED HELP OR WHAT ABOUT ME I NEED HELP. AND MANY PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT MANY PROGRAMS TO GET WERE PARENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO GET THE HELP THEY NEED ONE WHAT EASY ACCESS WHAT YOU'RE ALSO SEEING. IS WHEN YOU HAVE ADHD AND OTHER -- CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS FROM THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST THAT. SOMETIMES THE HEALTH PLANS -- OR THE DOCTORS REFUTE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ANY BOUNCES BACK AND FORTH SO MANY TIMES. THAT IT'S IT'S A IT'S ONLY A MISTY FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL CHILD AND SO LOVE TO BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. ABSOLUTELY AND GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN SAY THERE WAS A POSITIVE RESULT. ALWAYS OUTCOMES ALWAYS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND I JUST WANT TO SAY WE'RE DOING WE SERVE FIVE HUNDRED PARENTS IN YOUR DISTRICT INCLUDING A THOUSAND CHILDREN ATTACH THEM IN A PREVENTION PROGRAM THAT WE CALL STRENGTHENING FAMILY SAN BERNADINO.
