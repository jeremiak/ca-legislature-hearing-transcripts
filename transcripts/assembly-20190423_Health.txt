THE COST OF A HEARING IT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO PARENTS OBTAINING PEDIATRIC HEARING AIDS.

GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JENNIFER ONLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS REPRESENTING FORTY FIVE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS THAT. COLLECTIVELY DELIVER HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS -- CAP MUST OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IN INCREASES CONSUMER PREMIUMS WELL WE SYMPATHIZE WITH THIS ISSUE FEDERAL AND STATE LAW CURRENTLY DEFINED HOW STATES COVER BENEFITS. UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT STATES REQUIRE DISLIKE A BENCHMARK PLAN. THAT DEFINES DEFINES HEALTH RELATED SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT REFER TO IS ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. THE BENCHMARK PLANTS THAT OUTLINES THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS IN CALIFORNIA DOES NOT INCLUDE THIS DEVICE. THE ACA REQUIRES A STATE TO COVER BENEFITS WOULD EXCEED THE H. BEES AND ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW BOARD TO BURKE -- EIGHTY FIVE NINETY EIGHT EXCEEDS THE H. BEASON TRIGGERS ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR THE STATE BETWEEN TWO AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS -- AND ACCORDING TO TO BURKE THIS MANDATE WILL INCREASE HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS BY OVER THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THIS IS JUST SIMPLY THE WRONG TIME TO PASS NEW MANDATES -- SEVERAL BENEFIT MANDATES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN THE LEGISLATURE IN RECENT YEARS AND HAVE RETURNEDTHIS YEAR. OUR MEMBERS REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF BENEFIT MANDATES ON PREMIUMS. PARTICULARLY AS WE FACE -- THE IN HERE PRESSURES ON INVOLVING MY INSURANCE MARKET. THE TOTALITY OF MANDATES BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE EQUALS MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR. THE COST OF THE MONTHLY PREMIUM AS THE PRIMARY CONSIDERATION FOR CONSUMERS WHEN SELECTING A PLAN. THUS FAR CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A BETTER JOB COMPARED TO MOST STATES IN KEEPING COVERAGE AFFORDABLE WELL AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASES BELOW OTHER STATES. MAINTAINING A FOR A PREMIUMS AS CRITICAL AS POLICY MAKERS STRIVE TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR NEW BENEFIT MANDATES THAT DRIVE UP THE COST OF CARE. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. OKAY. THANK YOU. STEPHANIE WHAT CAN SOME WE HAVE THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE TO HEAR TODAY IN OPPOSITION I THINK EVERYONE AT THIS TABLE INCLUDING EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM IS SYMPATHETIC TO THIS ISSUE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS WAS NOT A PART OF THE ORIGINAL BENCHMARK PLAN THAT WAS CHOSEN BY THE LEGISLATURE. IT WILL BE RE AUTHORIZED -- NEXT YEAR AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT MAY BE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. THE INITIAL KAISER THIRTY PLUS PLAN SHOULD BE THE BENCHMARK OR WE SHOULD CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS THAT DO COVER OTHER BENEFITS BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS THIS. BILL WOULD EXCEEDS THE H. PIECES WOULD BE ADDITIONAL STATE COST TO THE SYSTEM AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT IMPOSING AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. AT THE CALIFORNIA LEVEL AND ALSO LOOKING AT INCREASING SUBSIDIES TO HELP PEOPLE AFFORD THEIR CURRENT HEALTHCARE. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ADDING ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD IMPACT THE GREATER CONSUMER POPULATION SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT CERTAINLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE. NEXT YEAR AS WE LOOK AT RE AUTHORIZING THE BENCHMARK PLAN. ANYONE ELSE. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WITH ECHO CAPEN ACT LOOKS COMMENTS -- LOOK FOR TO HAVE IN THE CONVERSATION -- DURING THE H. B. CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU. ANYONE ANYONE ELSE CASEY KNOWN BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM CAN MISTER BIGELOW. THANK YOU THIS IS. FOR THE AUTHOR -- HAVING HEARD THE OPPOSITION'S COMPONENTS IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU COULD. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD CONTINUE WORKING. TO RESOLVE SOME OF THAT ISSUE AND ALSO COULD YOU ADDRESS -- HURT HER ISSUES ABOUT NEXT YEAR WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE UP FOR RENEWAL -- FIRST OF COURSE OF COURSE I'M ALWAYS WILLING TO DISCUSS ISSUES WITH OPPOSITION AND THE DOORS OPEN -- TO CONTINUING TO DO THAT -- IN SO FAR AS NEXT YEAR -- IF WE CAN DO IT NEXT YEAR WHY CAN'T WE DO IF THE ISSUE IS THE RATES ARE GOING TO GO UP A LITTLE BIT AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. PENNIES ON THE ON THE POLICY -- IF WE CAN IF WE CAN DO THAT NEXT YEAR WHY NOT DO IT THIS YEAR. HIDETHE SOONER WE DO THIS TO SENIOR THE SOONER CALIFORNIA KIDS ARE PROTECTED ON THIS ISSUE -- APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED CHILDREN EVERY YEAR ARE NOT GETTING HEARING AIDS BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE -- AND COUNTLESS MOORE'S ARE PAYING OUT MORE ARE PAYING OUT OF THEIR POCKETS IN ADDITION THERE ARE PARENTS WHO BECAUSE THEY CAN -- RECEIVE HEARING AIDS UNDER MEDICARE AL WHO ARE WORKING WHO ARE LEAVING THEIR JOBS. SO THAT THEIR CHILDREN CAN GET MEDI CAL BENEFITS IN ORDER TO COVER THIS -- SO IN MY VIEW THERE IS AN IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO THIS NOW AND NOT WAIT ANOTHER YEAR HAD WE DONE THIS TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST STARTED ON THIS BILL ANOTHER THOUSAND CHILDREN WOULD HAVE HAD HEARING AIDS IN A TIMELY FASHION -- THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT AN ISSUE FOR THESE YOUNG CHILDREN INFANTS IN MANY CASES WHO ARE DIAGNOSED AND DO NOT GET HEARING AIDS THEIR OUTCOMES ARE DELAYED -- THEIR OUTCOMES AS THE AS THE THE PROFESSOR MENTIONED -- ARE NOT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE FOR CHILDREN AND ALL FOR THE LACK OF A HEARING AID. THANK YOU -- THIS. LAST QUESTION UP. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND MOST LIKELY. WE LOOK AT THE TIMING OF IT AND IT BECOMING -- SIGNED AND THEN ENACTED. DOES THE TIMING ACTUALLY WORK OUT. ALMOST THE SAME AS IT HAPPENING NEXT YEAR NO BECAUSE THAT PROCESS WILL TAKE TIME THAT PROCESS STARTS NEXT YEAR BUT IT DOES DOESN'T NECESSARILY AND NEXT YEAR. SO IT WOULD BE NEXT PROTRACTED PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE WE EVER SEE ANY RESULTS I'M VERY SIMPLE. THAT IT TO THE TO THE ISSUE HERE -- AND RECOGNIZE IT BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THERE'S A PART A SECOND PART OF THIS. TO MAKE IT HELP FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND THAT'S THE PLANS SO WE NEED. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE IT THAT ISSUES SO I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE AND WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON THIS AS IT CONTINUES MOVING THANK YOU. THE SECULAR KERR -- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- I THINK THERE'S A COME AND MADE IT HAS MEANT -- SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE FUNDING HAS NOT GONE UPSET. TOO DID I HEAR THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT. A IN INCOME OF FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS PER YEAR IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE THE STATE PAY FOR HEARING AIDS. ANY ASSISTANCE FOR HER. BUT FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK YOUR SON FOR A PARTICIPATING TODAY BECAUSE THIS IS A LITTLE BIT -- BUT NERVOUS AND SCARY BUT YOU DID A GREAT JOB AND I WANT TO THANK FIRST OF ALL THE FAMILIES THAT SHOWED UP I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FAMILIES CAME IN MY OFFICE. AND SHARE WITH ME THEIR FAMILY EXPERIENCES WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US -- THIS IS A GOOD FEELING BILL TO ME. AND IT YOU SHOULDN'T WAIT THE THING I DON'T LIKE IS HOW LONG DO WE ASK FAMILIES TO WAIT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO MOVE THIS ALONG FOR AND I'LL BE IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL TODAY WHEN WE GET TO THAT POINT ANYONE ELSE. I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU FOR ONCE AGAIN BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PERSISTENCE I SAID I SAID THIS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND I MEAN IT I ACTUALLY ACT REALLY MEAN IT -- I THINK WHEN -- THE I THINK THE TOTAL POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THIS I THINK WE HEARD WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. SIX WE ALSO HEARD THAT THE POTENTIAL PRODUCTIVITY LOSS FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE HEARING AIDS MIGHT BE AS MUCH AS A MILLION DOLLARS A PERSON. WE GOT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED KIDS WHO NEED HEARING AIDS THAT'S A POTENTIAL ECONOMIC LOSS OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS VERSUS A THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLAR EXPENDITURE. I'M SORRY THAT FEELS LIKE A NO BRAINER TO ME -- AND I THINK AND I'M AS I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TO HEAR TODAY -- WHILE I I RECOGNIZE IT IS NOT PART OF THE MANDATE OF FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEARING LOSS FOR THOSE PEOPLE HAVE VISION LOSS FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS. IT IS AN ESSENTIAL BENEFIT AND SO I I LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY IN THE FUTURE HELPING TO RECTIFY THAT SO THAT THIS IS PART OF A PART OF THE GREATER COVERAGE -- FOR KIDS GOING FORWARD SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM -- BUT IN THIS YEAR CREE WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING MORE I FORGOT I WOULD ALSO LIKE A **** IF I CAN BE A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL OF COURSE THANK YOU. LIKE ONCE OR TWICE OKAY -- WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM SO I'M FORCING WE CAN'T TAKE IT UP FOR BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER BLOOM.

ENGAGED IN THIS AS CHAIR AS THE STAKEHOLDERS. UNDER CONCERNS IN ORDER TO BRING THOSE INVALUABLE SERVICES TO OUR CHILDREN. WAS TO ME HERE TODAY I OF ZEMA CHRISTIAN. THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF MENTAL HEALTH AMERICAN OF CALIFORNIA. AND SORROW MICHAEL GUSMAN FROM THE USE FORWARD TO TESTIFY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. SO. FIRST. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN I'M ZIVA CREASING PRESIDENT AND CEO OF MENTAL HEALTH AMERICA OF CALIFORNIA MHC IS A SIXTY YEAR OLD GRASSROOTS ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON POLICY ADVOCACY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. THE IDEA THAT LED TO AB EIGHT CAME FROM CHI YET THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH EMPOWERMENT NETWORK WHICH IS A PROGRAM OF MHC. CLIENTS PRIORITIES AND DIRECTION IS A 100% DETERMINED BY THE YOUTH LEADERS AGES RANGE I RANGING FROM. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SIX CLIENTS USE LEADERS IDENTIFIED HAVING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT AT SCHOOL AS A KEY TO THEIR ON GOING MENTAL WELLNESS. THE ABILITY TO ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUPPORT WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION WHICH IS PROVEN TO FOSTER POSITIVE OUTCOMES. IN MY ROLE AS A GOVERNING BOARD MEMBER OF THAT SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HRE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY I RECENTLY HEARD AN UPDATE ON IN TSS MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. AND IT'S ROOTED IN THE IDENTIFICATION MODEL IN A 100% THERE'S A ROLE FOR IDENTIFICATION. BY IN THERE'S MANY INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON IDENTIFICATION BUT WHAT ABOUT HELP SEEKING YOUTH ARE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO GO WHEN THEY NEED HELP AND WHERE TO GO WITH THEIR FRIENDS NEED HELP. AND THEY CAN'T WAIT TO BE IDENTIFIED. WE WANT BETTER OUTCOMES FOR ADULTS WE MUST BE MUST DO BETTER WITH OUR KIDS CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD YET WE'RE TOWARDS THE BOTTOM. OF THE LIST IN PRAYER PEOPLE SPENDING AND TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE LIST IN PEER PRISONER SPENDING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU TO HONOR THE USE REQUEST. TO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT IN CHOOL WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIMPLY HEALTH COMMITTEE OF FOR YOUR TIME TODAY MY NAME IS SERRA MICHAEL GAST IN AND I'M A POLICY ADVOCATE WITH YOU FORWARD. AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT -- AB EIGHT YOU FOR IT IS A POLICY ADVOCACY NONPROFIT BASED IN SACRAMENTO THAT FOCUSES ON SUPPORTING THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN AND YOUTH. WE ARE WORKING WITH YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE IN EFFORTS TO INCREASE RESOURCES FOR YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. EVERYWHERE WE GO WE HEAR THAT THE NEED FOR INCREASED -- MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS ARE NECESSARY. FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR AND SOLANO COUNTY YOUTH LEADERS CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YOUTH AND NEEDS YOU. PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE IDENTIFIED MENTAL HEALTH AS ONE OF THEIR TOP THREE CONCERNS. THIS ORGANIZATION SOLANO YOUTH VOICES IS NOW ORGANIZING TO BRING MORE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS TO SCHOOL CAMPUSES. ULTIMATELY WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING AT LEAST ONE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL ON ALL ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL CAMPUSES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL WELLNESS AND SUCCESS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN SCHOOL. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN FOR ELEVEN YEARS OF AGE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS BUT OVER 70% OF THEM NEVER RECEIVED TREATMENT. THAT'S THE CYSTIC IS UNACCEPTABLE WE ARE LOSING OUR KIDS TO MENTAL ILLNESS THEY'RE SUFFERING FROM TRAUMA. DEPRESSION ANXIETY SUICIDE AND THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE SOLUTIONS. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE MORE POLICE OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS THAN THERE ARE COUNSELORS. NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS IN THE STATE ATTEND A SCHOOL THAT HAS A POLICE OR RESOURCE OFFICER BUT NO COUNSELOR. ACCORDING TO THE NATION IN THE NATION RIGHT REPORT BY THE ACLU. THAT'S ALARMING THE PRESENCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD NEVER OUTWEIGH MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES IN SCHOOLS THIS ONLY SERVES TO INCREASE STUDENT. ANXIETY AND HIDING DISCIPLINE DISPARITIES AMONG STUDENTS AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES. WHICH FURTHER TRAUMATIZE A STUDENTS BUT ALSO DETERIORATES A HEALTHY SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. IT'S TIME TO FLIP THIS NARRATIVE OUR SCHOOLS ARE THE BEST PLACES TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. SERVICES. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM WE NEED TO ENSURE THERE ARE MORE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. SOAP SUPPORTS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES THAT PROVIDE TIMELY. AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO SERVICES. AB EIGHT IS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS THIS MISSION I BELIEVE THAT IF WE DO NOT TAKE ACTION NOW OUR YOUTH WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER IN SILENCE. AND DEVELOP SEVERE OR DEBILITATING MENTAL ILLNESS WE ASK FOR YOUR A VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER SINCE SUPPORT. JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE THANK YOU.

ONE BUT IN MY STUDY SHOWS THAT IN THE MORE DISADVANTAGED AREA THAT NUMBER CAN SHIP SHOT UP TO OVER 80% OR EIGHTY PLUS PERCENT. SO THE I THINK YOU THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. AND TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS -- THE SERVICES TO OUR CHILDREN FOR NEXT GENERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. WELL I THINK HE WAS THE CHIEF ENTITIES IN THE BILL I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW CRITICAL THINGS THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT. I SUPPORT A SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR THAT CALLED FOR OF OF ESSENTIALLY RATIO ONE HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER FOR EVERY SIX HUNDRED AND HEARD HUNDREDS PUPILS. THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A RATIO OF ONE FOR FOUR HUNDRED I GUESS THE DIFFERENCES IN THE TWO BILLS NO SHOW WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE APPROPRIATE RATIO IS IN MY MIND -- AND TO BE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS IN OUR STE FOR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND AND LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCHOOLS. AND HONEY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WORKING WHAT ISN'T WORKING AND AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT WHICH IS ALSO CRITICAL -- AND RATHER THAN ESTABLISHING A RATIO STATE LAW BUT I I I WANT TO I WANT THE BILL TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. I ALSO WILL SAY THAT I HAVE I HAVE CONCERNS AROUND WORKFORCE -- WE HAVE A BIG CHALLENGE NOW. WITH PSYCHOLOGIST -- MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN WORK WITH CHILDREN. NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING FOR MORE AND MORE TO BE IN SCHOOLS WE HAVE A CRITICAL WORKFORCE SHORTAGE ISSUE ON THIS AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS GOING FORWARD SO -- WE DO HAVE A QUORUM -- AND SO IF THERE IS A MOTION TO BE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION. AND MOTION BY MS BURKE -- THE SECOND BY MISS CARILLO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS AMOUNT SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES. OCCUR OCCUR CURRY.

AB FIFTY AB FIFTY YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTY EXPANDS THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER PROGRAM TO MORE ELIGIBLE MEDI CAL ENROLLEES. WHO CAN BETTER IS OF BEASTS AND BE BETTER SERVING THE COMMUNITY BASED SETTING AT A COST SAVINGS TO THE STATE OF THE BILL? I WANT TO FIRST ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND APPRECIATE THE WORK OF STAFF TO RECONCILE THE 60% TRANSITION WILL FROM THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING REQUIREMENTS. WITH THE AMOUNT OF DAYS RESIDENT MUST BE REQUIRED TO STAY BEFORE BEING ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. OVER FOUR YEAR PERIOD AB FIFTY INCREASES THE WAIVER SLOTS FROM FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED AND OUR GROWING AGING POPULATION AND DEAL WITH THE OVER FOUR THOUSAND AND ROLL THE WAITING LIST. CURRENTLY. THIS IS LIVING WAIVER PROGRAM IS GROSSLY UNDER UTILIZED AS ONLY FIFTEEN COUNTIES A CONVERTED TO PAY. AB FIFTY MAKES THE PROGRAM STATEWIDE. AB FIFTY ALSO SETS OUT NEEDED ARE FAIR PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT AND REQUIRES ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS BUT APARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THIS IS LEGAL DURING WAIVER PROGRAM PROVIDES A QUICK COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES TO INSTITUTIONALIZATION. ELIGIBLE OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ON MEDI CAL. EXPANDING THE LW PROGRAM IS ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO THE ONLY STATE DECISION. FIND AT THE UNNECESSARY INSTANT INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AS A VIOLATIONS AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT THEREBY ESTABLISHING THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES RECEIVE SERVICES. IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING. EVEN THOUGH THE DEPARTMENT RENEW THE WAIVER PROGRAM FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION TO INTEGRATE THE PROGRAM WITH THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WAIVER. AND AB FIFTY INCLUDES LANGUAGE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT TRANSITION AND ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT A RAMP UP SERVICES. PRIOR TO THAT ARE OCCURRING. WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IS GEORGE CANARIAN SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF SIX BEDS AND LISA COLEMAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU TO CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS GEORGE COULD NEAR AND I'M HERE A SIX BED WHICH IS A STATEWIDE TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS BOARDING CARE HOMES A SORT OF ADULTS AND OLDER ADULTS. LIKE TO START OUT BY THINKING ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA FOR CONTINUING TO CHAMPION FOR IMPROVEMENT TO THE LW PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM IS JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF ITS POTENTIAL AS A CAN HELP SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF AN AGING POPULATION HOMELESSNESS AND SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. YOU KNOW I HEAR TERMS SUCH AS LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS A CONTINUUM OF CARE BUT GIVEN THAT SAN FRANCISCO HAS LOST 34% OF ITS IS ALL RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND 26%. WAS RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IT BEGS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE TRULY HAVE A CONTINUUM OF CARE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT FROM A MEDI CAL FUNDING PERSPECTIVE THERE IS NO TRUE CONTINUE ON WHAT WE HAVE INSTEAD IS A PATCHWORK OF SERVICES. ON ONE HAND WE HAVE A PROGRAM LIKE AYE HSS THE PROVIDE SERVICES AT HOME AND MIND YOU FOR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT SERVICE TO ACCESS. ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING SUCH AND SUCH A SNIFFS AND IN BETWEEN THESE TWO WE HAVE A GAPING HOLE THAT THE ALE W. WAS TRYING TO FILL WITH A MEAGER 500-070-0404 SLOTS. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE THAT JUST REPRESENTS RESIDENTIAL CARE BEDS FOR OLDER ADULTS AND SKILLED NURSING BEDS HENCE THE GAPING HOLE IN OUR SYSTEM. FOR PERSONS LIVING IN A BOARDING CARE ON SS I SS BE FUNDING IS LIMITED TO THE NON MEDICAL OUT OF HOME CARE RATE WHICH IS ONE THOUSAND FIFTY EIGHT DOLLARS PER MONTH OR ROUGHLY THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS PER DAY. YOU CAN'T AFFORD A ROACH INFESTED MOTEL FOR THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS PER DAY THE BOARDING TEARS ARE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE HOUSING UTILITIES. FOOD STAFF TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WITH ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AS WELL AS MEDICATION MANAGEMENT. OF A BOARDING CARE HAS SIX RESIDENTS ALL ON SS I SS P. AND HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE OF THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE OR MORE IT WOULD BE MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FULLY PAY STAFF MINIMUM WAGE. MUCH LESS PAY FOR PAYROLL TAXES WORKERS COMP INSURANCE LIABILITY INSURANCE PROPERTY TAXES AND MORE. IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE AND TO SEE THE RATE AT WHICH SAN FRANCISCO LOSING BOARDING CARES OR THE LA COUNTY HAS LOST OVER ONE THOUSAND A. R. F. BEDS OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. SO WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT THESE HOMES CLOSING WHILE THESE LOSSES COME DISPLACEMENT OF MANY LOW INCOME ADULTS THERE ARE SUFFERING FROM SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS PUTTING THEM AT RISK OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION OR WORSE YET HOMELESSNESS. OF A CONTINUUM OF CARE IS TRULY TO WORK IT SHOULD HELP PROVIDE THE RIGHT HOUSING AND THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME. WE CAN'T DISENTANGLE HOUSING FROM HEALTH AS HOUSING OR A LACK LACK THERE OF HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON HEALTH. THE REASON WHY THESE HOMES ARE SO IMPORTANT AND WORTH SAVING IS BECAUSE THEY SAID AT THE VERY INTERSECTION OF HOUSING AND CARE. WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW HOWEVER IS THAT THESE HOMES CAN'T BE ACCESSED EFFECTIVELY FOR THAT ONE THOUSAND FIFTY EIGHT A MONTH? AB FIFTY CAN HELP BY INCREASING THE LWS CAPACITY TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SLOTS PROVIDE FOR GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION AND INCREASING PROVIDER RATE THAT CAN AUGMENT THE SS I SS P. RATE. THEREBY RESULTING IN A MORE ROBUST PROGRAM THAT WILL BE BETTER POSITIONED TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S CHALLENGES OF AN AGING POPULATION HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL ILLNESS BY HELPING TRANSFORM MEDICALS PATCHWORK OF SERVICES AND TOOK IN TRUE CONTINUE OF CARE THAT DELIVERS THE RIGHT HOUSING. AND THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LISA COLEMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION. BOB IT IS WITH INCREASING FRUSTRATION AND FRANTIC PHONE CALLS THAT WE'RE RECEIVING FROM OLDER ADULTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TRYING TO FIND A PLACE FOR THEIR LOVED. ONE IT IS A CRUEL FATE TO FIND YOURSELF NOT ILL ENOUGH FOR SKILLED NURSING. BUT NOT RESOURCE ENOUGH TO AFFORD THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH AS AN AVERAGE ASSISTED LIVING COST. OR THAT YOUR ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING REQUIRE MORE THAN OUR CURRENT I IT JUST SAYS SYSTEM CAN ALLOW. AB FIFTY ADDRESSES THIS IN A COMMON SENSE IT IN A IN A GOOD LEGISLATION APPROACH. IT'S A WIN TO THE STATE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LAST YEAR SAID THAT THISPROGRAM SAVE THE STATE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. IT'S A WIN TO OLDER ADULTS AND DISABLED ADULTS ALLOWING THEM THE DIGNITY TO LIVE IN AN ASSISTED LIVING ENVIRONMENT INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SHARE A ROOM. IN AN INSTITUTIONAL SETTING OF A SKILLED NURSING UNNECESSARILY. OUR PHONE CALLS ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE TO GET OUT OF A SKILLED NURSING INTO A LOWER LEVEL OF CARE OMBUDSMAN'S DO AMAZING THINGS BUT WE CANNOT FABRICATE LOW INCOME HOUSING. BUT THE LEGISLATION CAN WITH THE EXPANSION OF THIS BILL WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

AND ME A SECOND HERE. AB. EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN AB CODIFIES POSITION OF CALIFORNIA SURGEON GENERAL AND PLACES THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE SURGEON GENERAL. THE COMPANY'S SURGEON GENERAL POSITION CREATED THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER ON JANUARY SEVENTH OF THIS YEAR BY GOVERNOR MUSEUM. PRESENTS AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH EQUITY IS CENTRAL TO CALIFORNIA. TO ALIGN EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE DISPARITIES INEQUITIES AND TO ADDRESS TRAUMA AND THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THE SURGEON GENERAL IS CHARGED ADVISING THE GOVERNOR ON A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING HEALTH RISKS AND CHALLENGES BY LEVERAGING THE INSIGHTS OF STAKEHOLDERS. AND SERVING AS A SPOKESPERSON ON PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. THIS BILL ENSURES THE POSITION OF SURGEON GENERAL EXIST LONG OPERA CURRENT SITTING GOVERNORS OUT OF OFFICE. THAT HIS LEGACY CONTINUES ON AND THE NEED A POSITION OF SURGEON GENERAL IS CODIFIED IN STATUTE. FURTHERMORE IN ORDER TO BUILD A LINE IT WITH ON GOING EFFORTS UNDER ALREADY UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER AB EIGHTY SEVEN PROPOSES TO PLACE THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY UNDER THE DIRECTION THE SURGEON GENERAL. THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE UP BY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH STATUS OF ALL POPULATIONS% IN PLACES WITH THE PRIORITY IN ELIMINATING HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES. AND INEQUITIES. I PROVIDING THE SURGEON GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY NOT ONLY ARE WE ALIGNING NEW EFFORTS THE SURGEON GENERAL WITH EXISTING APRS UNDER DPH. BASED ON THEIR MISSION ALIGNMENT WILL BE MAKING A COST EFFECTIVE DECISION TO USE EXISTING STAFF AND RESOURCES RATHER THAN BUILDING OUT NEW POSITIONS MORE STATE DOLLARS. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE STATES IN THE NATION BUT THE MAJORITY OF ITS POPULATION OVER 60%. COMPRISES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN ADVANCING HEALTHEQUITY IT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TOWARDS LIVING UP TO OUR PROMISE OF HEALTH FOR ALL. BY KIND OF KIND OF BUYING NEW INNOVATIVE IDEAS SUCH AS THE POSITION OF SURGEON GENERAL AND OFFICIALLY USING ALREADY EXISTING RESOURCES WE CAN REACH OUR GOAL OF HEALTH EQUITY EFFECTIVELY. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS LINDA TO TO NARROW ITS POLICY ADVOCATE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK. THANK YOU CHAIR IN MEMBERS LINDA TEAR WHAT'S ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN I THINK HEALTH NETWORK A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE. WE ARE A STATEWIDE HEALTH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION COMMITTED TO PROMOTING HEALTH EQUITY FOR HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. AS AN ORGANIZATION WHO HAS LONG CHAMPIONED THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF ALLEVIATING HEALTH DISPARITIES THROUGH INVESTMENT IN PREVENTION EFFORTS. THIS INCLUDES RESPONDING TO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH SUCH AS HOW RACE CLASS AND GENDER BIAS AND PHYSICAL SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTS AFFECT THE HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS. AB EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN ANCHORS THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL INTO STATE LAW SO THAT ISSUES OF HEALTH EQUITY AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF POLICYMAKING. GIVEN EXISTING STATE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY THE CITY IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO ALIGN THE OFFICES MISSION UNDER THE SURGEON GENERAL'S PURVIEW. ALIGNING BOTH THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY AND THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL WILL LEAD TO MORE COHESIVE STRATEGY MAKING AND INVITE GREATER CROSS SECTOR COLLABORATION TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES. IN FACT OTHER STATES SUCH AS ARKANSAS IN FLORIDA HAVE ALREADY BEEN STATED THEIR OWN SURGEONS GENERAL TO MEET THESE NEEDS. ARKANSAS FOR EXAMPLE HAS CODIFIED THE POSITION OF THE STATE'S SURGEON GENERAL WHO ADVISES THE GOVERNOR BY ENGAGING A VARIETY OF DIVERSE STATE AGENCIES ON HEALTH REFORM. SIMILARLY AB EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN WILL BUILD UPON THE WORK OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY BY ELIMINATING THE SILOS BETWEEN STATE ENTITIES IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. FOR EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHT SEVEN THANK YOU. ANGELA WILLIAMS CALIFORNIA BLACK HEALTH NO WORK IN SUPPORT OF AB.

EFFORTS TO DOING THINGS DIRECTLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE EQUITY FOCUS PARTICULARLY ME AFTER AMERICAN COMMUNITY.

SIX FIFTY SIX THIS FEATURE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF SUMMER GARCIA. AB SIXTY SIX HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR COORDINATED AT INTERSECTIONAL STRATEGIES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO VIOLENCE AND THE ENVIRONMENTS AND LISTENERS. SECOND. CURRENT POLICIES IN PUBLIC FUNDING RESPONDED BY LISTENER REACTIONARY FASHION RATHER THAN A PREVENTIVE. ONE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL TO TAKE A PROACTIVE APPROACH A VIOLENCE PREVENTION IT WILL DO THIS THROUGH THE CREATION OF AN OFFICE OF HEALTH. HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITIES UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE SURGEON GENERAL WITH THE GOAL OF ADDRESSING THE NEXUS BETWEEN VIOLENT BEHAVIOR AND PUBLIC HEALTH INEQUITIES. THIS NEW OFFICE WILL BE TASKED WITH DEVELOPING IMPLEMENTING AND MONITORING A CALIFORNIA VISION AND PLAN FOR VIOLENCE PREVENTION SAFETY AND HEALING BY. CONNECTING THE VISION AND PLAN TO THE GOVERNOR STRATEGIES FOR YOU DEVELOPMENT CRIMINAL JUVENILE JUSTICE REFORM HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND OTHER RELATED AREAS OPPORTUNITY. IDENTIFYING AND INTEGRATING TRAUMA CENTER DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS SUCH AS EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING. DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT TO SUPPORT BY THIS PREVENTION INTERVENTION AND HEALING AND CREATING AN INTERACTIVE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY THAT PRIORITIZES THE VOICES OF PEOPLE DIRECTLY IMPACTED AND DOING THE WORK TO PREVENT VIOLENCE. AT PROMOTE PEACE AND HEALING AND COMMUNITIES. ALONGSIDE THIS BILL IS A BUDGET REQUEST FOR A ONE TIME ALLOCATION SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT STAFF CONSULTANTS AND INITIAL EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH CARRYING OUT THE TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITY THE OFFICE. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORTER DEANGELO MAC DIRECTORS STATE OF THE DIRECTOR STATE POLICY AND PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES AND COME UP ALL DHALIWAL CO FOUNDER. AND ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AT THE RISE CENTER. SHARE OUT THERE WE ARE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S ANGELA MAC. I'M WITH PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES AND THE STATE DIRECTOR -- THERE AND UP THERE PROCESS BONSOR THIS BILL. EIGHTY EIGHTY SIX FIVE SIX PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES PROMOTES HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND FOCUSES ON ELIMINATING HEALTH DISPARITIES BY TRANSFORMING NEIGHBORHOODS INTO PLACES THAT NURTURE WELL BEING. AND THIS INCLUDES STANDING BEHIND GOOD POLICY THAT MAKES HEALTH A REALITY FOR ALL. AB SIX FIVE SIX IS A GOOD POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT VIOLENCE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE OF GREAT MAGNITUDE VIOLENCE IS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO MALES. AGES FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE AND IN MANY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. VIOLENCE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD. THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF VIOLENCE INCLUDE CHRONIC DISEASE SUCH AS HEART DISEASE CANCER STROKE ASTHMA AND MANY MORE. AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES LIKE PTSD -- DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY INCREASED EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE LOWERS EVERY DAY QUALITY OF LIFE AND INCREASES THE RISK OF PER PERPETRATING VIOLENCE. MENTAL TRAUMA FROM EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE HAS BEEN SIGNATURE THAT SCIENTIFICALLY SHOWN TO INCREASE A PERSON'S RISK OF ADOPTING VIOLENT BEHAVIOR THEMSELVES -- MEANING THAT VIOLENT BEHAVIOR TRANSMITS AND SPREADS BASED ON EXPOSURE JUST LIKE IN THE EPIDEMIC DISEASE. THE OFFICE OF HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITIES WOULD HELP TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA DUE TO VIOLENCE BY ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF VIOLENCE AND DEVELOPING IT AND IMPLEMENTING WITH THE HELP OF CULTURALLY COMPETENT COMMUNITY MINDED INDIVIDUALS. A CALIFORNIA PLAN FOR VIOLENCE PREVENTION SAFETY AND HEALING IN CONCLUSION -- I'M EXCITED TODAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THIS RIGHT -- IN MY PREVIOUS WORK I SERVED OVER HUNDREDS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- AFFECTED BY VIOLENCE SHOT STABBED ASSAULTED AND I SIT BEFORE YOU AS THEIR VOICE SAYING PLEASE. PASS THIS BILL WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KHAN RECALL DALI WALL AND ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AND CO FOUNDER OF THE RISE YOU CENTER IN RICHMOND. MY PRONOUNS ARE SHE HER AND HERS ALLOWED I'M PROUD SPONSOR OF AB. SIX FIVE SIX RICE CREATE SAFE SPACES GROUNDED IN SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO LOVE LEARN EDUCATE HE'LL AND TRANSFORMS LIVES AND COMMUNITIES. WE DO THIS THEIR PROGRAMMING IN AREAS OF COMMUNITY HEALTH EDUCATION AND JUSTICE YOUTH LEADERSHIP IN RGANIZING AND MEDIA ARTS AND CULTURE. TWENTY FOURTEEN YOUR TWENTY FOURTEEN RISING GAUGE OVER FIVE HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES AND ARTICULATIONS OF TRAUMA VIOLENCE COPING AND HEALING. WHAT WE LEARNED IS THE FOLLOWING THAT TRAUMA IS PERVASIVE ASSUMED AND MULTI DIMENSIONAL? YET GETS TREATED LARGELY BY THE ADULTS AND SYSTEMS THAT WE WORK AND AS EPISODIC BEHAVIORAL AN INDIVIDUAL. TRAUMAS ORGANIZE THEIR SILENCING AND SHAMING MEDIATED THROUGH SUBSTANCE USE AS WELL AS HARM TO SELF AND OTHERS. IN A SUBSEQUENT YOUTH WEBINQUIRY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH ALMOST TWO HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE -- WHO TALK TO THEIR PEERS ABOUT THEIR PRIMARY COPING STRATEGY WHICH WAS SMOKING WEED ONE OF THE MOST PAINFUL AND PROFOUND THINGS WE HEARD WAS THAT? YOUNG PEOPLE SHARE THE RISK OF GETTING CAUGHT WITH MARIJUANA. FELT LESS HARMFUL THAN THE RISK OF TRYING TO ACCESS AN ADULT WHO COULD HELP. SO THIS ATMOSPHERIC DISTRESS IS REFLECTED IN REINFORCED THROUGH ON EMPATHETIC AND JUDGMENTAL EXPERIENCES WITH ADULTS WHO ARE STEWARDS OF THE SYSTEMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM. SO RISE WE WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE LEGAL INJURY AND TOO MANY TIMES MERE MY STAFF HAD TO INTERVENE THE LANGUAGE AND TONE OF HEALTH CARE STAFF WINNER FOR TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WEBER OVER A DOZEN BULLET HOLES IN THEM AS NON COMPLIANT -- ACTING AS BABIES. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEMS THAT HOLD THEM CULPABLE FOR THEIR INJURY AND THEN LACK IN CONNECTING THEM TO THE RESOURCES AND SERVICES THAT ARE RIGHTFULLY AND LEGALLY BEARS. SO WHEN WE ASK YOUNG PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEEDED THE MOST RESPOND RESOUNDING RESPONSE WAS THE NEED DESIRE AND EXPECTATION FOR ADULTS AND A SYSTEMS. WHO CAN CARE A FIRM AND LOVE THEM? THEY SAID THEY NEED ADULTS AND SYSTEMS WHO CAN PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND STRUCTURE AND PREDICTABILITY. AN ADULT WHO CAN WORK TOGETHER BETTER WITHIN AND ACROSS THE SYSTEMS RESPONSIBLE FOR US FOR THEM. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITIES AS EVER TIMELY IT'S A DIRECT CALL TO ACTION FROM OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND IN ORDER TO MEANINGFULLY CREATE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WE MUST UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS SAFETY AS OUR YOUNG PEOPLE DO AND ALL OF ITS DIMENSIONS. PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT SAFETY LIES IN SANCTUARY NOT SURVEILLANCE THAT COMES THROUGH HEALING NOT JUST INTERVENING OR ENFORCING. AND THAT MY SAFETY IS CONNECTED TO THE ANGELOS HIS TO MINE HOURS TO YOURS AND YOURS TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE'S AND TO EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM.

GIVE FIVE WILL BE THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH COULD MISTER KALRA [inaudible] MR GABRIEL THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED ONE SIX SIX A BILL TO PROVIDE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROFESSIONAL VIOLENCE. PREVENTION SERVICES FOR VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE AND OTHER VIOLENT INCIDENTS. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHERRY COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS MEASURE. THIS LEGISLATION ADDRESSES THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY THAT FAR TOO MANY VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR RE INJURY AND RETALIATION. INDEED STUDIES HAVE ESTIMATED THAT IN URBAN AREAS OVER 40% OF PATIENTS TREATED FOR VIOLIN INJURY SUCH A SHOOTING ARE RE INTERRED WITHIN FIVE YEARS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE ALARMING TRENDS PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED HOSPITAL BASED VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS AS ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING RATES OF FIND THE RE ENTRY. THESE PROGRAMS BRING SPECIALLY TRAINED AND CERTIFIED VIOLENCE INTERVENTION SPECIALISTS SO YOU TO THE HOSPITAL AND A UNIQUE MOMENT OF OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. AS HIGH RISK FOR BINARY INJURIES. CITIES HAVE REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED THE SUCCESS OF SUCH PROGRAMS YET THESE PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN A ONLY A FEW CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS LEADING TO THOUSANDS OF MISSED OPPORTUNITIES FOR EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS THE CYCLE OF GUN VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES EVERY YEAR. AB ONE SIX SIX WOULD LEVERAGE FEDERAL MEDICAID DOLLARS BY CREATING A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING STREAM FOR THESE PROGRAMS BY EXPANDING UTILIZATION OF THE SERVICES THIS LEGISLATION WOULD SAVE LIVES. PROTECT TAXPAYER FUNDS REDUCE BURDENS ON THE MEDICAL JUDICIAL SYSTEMS AND ADDRESS TROUBLING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION ARE ARI FRY LIKE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS TO RECORD WITH THE DIFFERENCE LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. AND SHALL DECKER VICE CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY AT UCLA AND FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF THE UC SAN FRANCISCO WRAPAROUND PROJECT THANK YOU AGAIN RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON CHARMAN WOULD AN HONORABLE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. MY NAME'S ARE SHALL DECKER AM A TRAUMA SURGEON AND CURRENTLY THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AT UCLA AND FOUNDING DIRECTOR -- AS REPRESENT OF GABRIEL HAD MENTIONED OF THE SAN FRANCISCO WRAPAROUND PROJECT A HOSPITAL BASED VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAM. I ALSO SERVED AS THE CHAIR OF THE ADVISORY BOARD FOR THE NATIONAL NETWORK OF POSSIBLE BASED VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAM. AT THE HOSPITAL BASED MODEL IS THAT OF PROGRAMS THAT WORK WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY AND CERTAINLY IN THE STATE. IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS CURRENTLY IT RIVALS OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THAT WE CONSIDER EPIDEMIC. VIOLENCE IS THE NUMBER ONE KILLER AS DEANGELO MAC HAD POINTED OUT OF YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN AND NUMBER TWO AMONG LATINOS. APPROACHING IT THROUGH A PUBLIC HEALTH LENS ALLOWS US TO RECOGNIZE IF WE WORK TO MITIGATE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH VIOLENCE WE CAN GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS ISSUE. OVER SIXTY THOUSAND AMERICANS ARRIVING OR TRAUMA CENTERS ANNUALLY AND AS A RESULT OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS AND STAB WOUNDS FOR MANY OF THESE VICTIMS IT'S NOT THEIR FIRST INJURY. TRAUMA SYSTEMS HAVE TREMENDOUS RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TO CARE FOR VICTIMS PHYSICAL WOUNDS. AFTER DAYS OR EVEN MONTHS OF RECOVERY THAT WE JUST CHARGE THESE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE WITHOUT ADDRESSING WHY THEY GOT HURT. THE RESULT WE SEE THE SAME YOUNG FACES BACK IN OUR TRAUMA BAY. YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS IS TOTALLY INADEQUATE VIOLENCE IS A CHRONIC RECURRENT DISEASE PLAGUING OUR COMMUNITIES BUT WE CAN PROVIDE A WHOLE PERSON CARE. OUR TRAUMACENTERS CAN AND SHOULD BE THE PORTAL OF ENTRY INTO ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES AND BUILD SOCIAL CAPITAL IN OUR COMMUNITIES. HOSPITAL BASED VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROVIDES WHOLE PERSON CARE AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT IN SOMEONE'S LIFE. IN A GROWING NUMBER CENTERS THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BECOME PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE TRAUMA CENTER IN THE TRAUMA SYSTEM. DESPITE THE STRUGGLE TO FUND THE WORK. CULTURALLY COMPETENT TRAINED PREVENTION PROFESSIONALS GO TO THE BAD SIDE OF AN INJURED PERSON JUST LIKE I DO. AND PROVIDED DURING THAT GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY AT A MENTOR SHIP THAT IS ABSOLUTELY INDELIBLE THIS PREVENTION PROFESSIONAL IS SOMEONE WHO HAS OVERCOME IRVINE VIOLENCE. AND THEY'RE THE BACKBONE OF THESE PROGRAMS THEY PROVIDE NOT ONLY MENTOR SHIP BUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION THAT TRADITIONALLY VICTIMS WOULD NOT SEEK OUT ON THEIR OWN. OUR RESEARCH PROVES THAT THIS APPROACH WORKS WE HAVE HAD SUCCESSES WITH REDUCING RECIDIVISM OF UP 23240% IN OUR TRAUMA CENTERS AND WE'RE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED AND HAVE NOT SOUGHT OUT TRADITIONALLY ON THEIR OWN. IN ADDITION WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THROUGH OUR LEVERAGE IN THE COMMUNITIES EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. ALL WENT WITH THIS MIKE TEXADA IS -- PREVENTION PROFESSIONAL AT SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL. WHEN I WORKED THERE'S A TRAUMA SURGEON I WOULD HAVE THIS MOMENT RIGHT BEFORE I MADE AN INCISION? WHEN I WOULD SILENTLY SAY TO MYSELF I JUST HAVE TO GET? THIS PATIENT OFF THE TABLE SO THAT MY CAN SAVE HIS LIFE. THE VALUE OF PREVENTION PROFESSIONALS IS PROFOUND. WE NEED TO CODIFY THAT IN AB ONE SIXTY SIX CAN DO IT. IT PROVIDES NOT ONLY MECHANISM TO SUSTAIN EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WORK IT PROVIDES THE IMPETUS FOR NEW ONES AND SOLIDIFIES A PROCESS OF TRAINING. AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. THE ALTERNATIVE IS JUST TO CONTINUE TO PUT ON REALLY EXPENSIVE BANDAIDS WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE UNDERLYING MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RISK OF VIOLIN INJURY. DISCHARGING INJURED PATIENTS WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES IS A CAN TO DISCHARGING A PATIENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK WITHOUT ASPIRIN. OR ANY TYPE OF A OF HYPERTENSIVE BLOOD PRESSURE -- ADJUSTMENT FOR DIET AND EXERCISE. I I AM -- I AM HONORED TO BE HERE TO PROVIDE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I'LL. ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ARI FILE IT CAN LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR DIFFERENT LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE -- WHICH IS THE WORKING CALIFORNIA FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND IS NOW CURRENTLY LED BY FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN AND GONE BALLOT SURVIVOR GABBY GIFFORDS.

AND WE BELIEVE THE TIME HAS COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE. TO CHECK CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH AND WELL BEING IS AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT IN ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE AN ENORMOUS HUMAN IMPACT OF COMMUNITY VIOLENCE IN THE STATE. MURDER IS NOT JUST LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUNG MEN OF COLOR YOUNG BLACK MEN IN THIS COUNTRY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AS MANY DEATHS AS EVERY OTHER BECAUSE COMBINED AMONG YOUNG BLACK MEN -- HUMAN NATURAL ACCIDENTAL SUICIDE COMBINED. AND THOSE WHO DO SURVIVE A SHOOTING RIGHT THAT'S THE HIGHER RISK OF RE INJURY ESPECIALLY WHEN BECOME EMBROILED IN CYCLES OF INJURY TRAUMA AND RETALIATION THAT CAN THE WHOLE COMMUNITIES SCARRED BY THE ACTIONS OF A RELATIVE FEW. REPORTER RATES OF PTSD AMONG YOUTH AND SOME OF OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES. AT NEARLY TWICE THE RATE REPORTED FOR TROOPS RETURNING FROM IRAQ. THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. THAT'S WHEN THAT MEDI CAL IS UNIQUELY WELL EQUIPPED TO ADDRESS SINCE EVEN BEFORE ECA EXPANSIONS OF MEDICAID IN THE STATE. TWO THIRDS OF ALL GONNA SOLVE HOSPITALIZATION PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA WERE COVERED BY THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. WE COULDN'T MUST BE DOING SO MUCH MORE TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS THAT WORK FOR THE HIGHEST RATE HIGHEST RISK PATIENTS IN THIS POPULATION. THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB ONE SIXTY SIX TO EXPAND ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE AISLES PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND HELP MAKE CALIFORNIA A NATIONAL LEADER IN TREATING COMMUNITY VIOLENCE AS A SERIOUS INCREMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. BECAUSE CAMINO VIOLENCE IMPOSES ENORMOUS FISCAL BURDENS ON THE MEDICAL SYSTEM WE ALSO ESTIMATED THAT THIS BILL WOULD RESULT IN DIRECT COST SAVINGS TO MEDICAL MANY WOULD PAY FOR ITSELF.

OTHER ANY -- ANALYSIS SEARCH RESULTS AS FAR AS THE IMPACT AND AND POTENTIALLY. THE INITIAL COST FOR THE BENEFITS DOWN THE ROAD. SOME MULTIPLE STATES HAVE TAKEN EFFORTS TO INVEST IN THE HOUSE WILL BE FOUND TO MENTION PROGRAMS THROUGH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FUNDING APPROACHES SOME THROUGH THE VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAMS OR VICTIMS. OF CRIME ACT ASSISTANCE GRANTS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LEE PENNSYLVANIA IS THE ONLY STATE THAT IS THE HAS A SMALL PILOT PROGRAM CURRENTLY FUNDING THIS THROUGH MEDI CAL. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A COVERED BENEFIT IN THIS PROPOSAL. DOES THEIR JURISDICTIONS. COVERED BENEFITS. AS FAR AS WE KNOW ONLY PENNSYLVANIA AT THIS POINT -- NEW JERSEY IS MOVING A NEARLY IDENTICAL BILL THIS YEAR AND WE HOPE THAT CALIFORNIA WILL HELP LEAD THE WAY TO MAKE THIS PART OF A A DEFINED COVER BENEFIT FROM MEDICAID POPULATIONS WOULD COULD NATIONWIDE ARE -- ARE THE MAJORITY OF GUNSHOT VICTIMS -- THAT IS THEIR INSURANCE -- SO CALIFORNIA HAS CALIFORNIA AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE BEEN INVESTING -- IN HOUSE WILL BE FOUND TO THE BENCH PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE SHOWN EFFECTIVENESS -- IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT FUNDER THAT MEDI CAL HAS NOT FUNDED THOSE OR COVER THOSE IS DEFINED BENEFIT. FOR YEAH RIGHT THANK YOU VERY FOR THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COULD I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE THE COST OF THIS ARE SO SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF THE COST HIM A LIFE IN THE FINANCIAL COST OF THIS. CYCLE OF VIOLENCE THAT EVEN IF THERE'S A VERY SMALL REDUCTION -- FROM IT IN IN RECIDIVISM AND VIOLENCE BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM I COULD GENERATE ENORMOUS COST SAVINGS FOR THE STATE. YEAH I DON'T I DON'T RECALL THE NUMBER BUT I'VE SEEN THAT COSTS OF A GUNSHOT. VICTIM THE OUR COSTS AND IT'S ASTRONOMICAL I DO IN REPEATS ITSELF OUT IT'S YOU KNOW RIDICULOUS. WHAT WHAT IS THE COST SO WE THIS WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO THAT WE DID A STUDY IN SAM'S IS GOING ON AVERAGE IT WAS IT WAS ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VICTIM? OF FOR GUNSHOT STAFF GOING A LITTLE BIT LESS EXPENSIVE BUT BUT THAT PUTS IT IN PERSPECTIVE AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS IF WE COULD. IF WE COULD REDUCE RECIDIVISM BY JUST TWO PEOPLE THAT THE THESE PROGRAMS WOULD PAY FOR THEMSELVES AND THOSE ARE FOR SURVIVORS. CORRECT YES YEAH AND I I MEAN I'VE SEEN ESTIMATES THAT HAVEN'T NORTH OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A TRAFFIC WELL. AS WHICH WHAT CLOTHES ACT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU I SUPPOSE SAID THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- IT'S WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN OF AN ANALYSIS DONE BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM -- OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ABOUT POINT.

ESTABLISH OUTCOME INDICATORS IN AN INTEGRATE CARE AND STANDARDIZED GERIATRICS TRAINING AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. RESHAPE THE MOTION AND SECOND I HAVE -- WHAT THIS IS IN SUPPORT? THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JANET FRANK AND I'M A FACULTY ASSOCIATE AT THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH AND ON FACULTY AT THE UCLA FIELDING SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHARE FINDINGS FROM OUR STUDY ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT IN OLDER ADULTS SPONSORED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. IN OUR STUDY WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT UNMET NEEDS. ARE AND GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES ACROSS THE STATE. WE FOUND A FEW PROGRAMS OR OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO OLDER ADULTS. OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT AND DATA WAS QUITE LIMITED SOURCE DATA REPORTING HOWEVER WE DID ALSO IDENTIFY PROMISING PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THESE DEFICITS. BASED ON OUR FINDINGS WE MADE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING TO ESTABLISH A FULL TIME ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERSHIP POSITION AT THE STATE LEVEL DEDICATED TO OLDER ADULT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WITH THE PROPER AUTHORITY THE LEADERSHIP POSITION COULD CONTRIBUTE TO AN OVERSEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES TO IMPROVE SERVICES. PROVIDE NEEDED OVERSIGHT FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS ESTABLISH STANDARDIZED DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. GUIDE COUNTY EFFORTS TO ENHANCE OLDER ADULT OUTREACH AND DOCUMENT DOCUMENTATION OF UNMET NEED. PROMOTE STANDARDIZE GERIATRIC TRAINING AN INCREASE SERVICE INTEGRATION EFFORTS ESPECIALLY BETWEEN MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGING AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES. TO PROMOTE A COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE FOR OLDER ADULTS. IN CLOSING I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE STRONG AN IMMEDIATE NEED FOR A FULL TIME LEADERSHIP POSITION TO OVERSEE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE STATE LEVEL. OUR STUDY SHOWED THAT OLDER ADULTS HAD HIGH UNMET NEEDS BUT WE DID NOT QUANTIFY THAT NEED HOWEVER RECENT STATE DATA. PRESENTED AT LAST WEEK'S CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL MAY SHED SOME LIGHT ON THESE UNMET NEEDS. DATA WERE PRESENTED SHOWING THAT JUST OVER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS THOSE SIXTY FIVE AND OVER WERE PROVIDED WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. CALIFORNIA'S OLDER ADULT POPULATION IS ABOUT SEVEN MILLION. IN MOST OLDER ADULT PREVALENCE STUDIES SHOW THAT ABOUT 20% OF OLDER ADULTS OFTEN SUFFER FROM A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROBLEM. BUT LET'S TAKE A MORE CONSERVATIVE NUMBER LET'S JUST SAY 10% OR ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS ARE IN NEED OF SERVICES. SO THE STATE SERVED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND REPRESENTING A VERY TIGHT TINY PROPORTION OF THOSE ARE IN NEED AND RIGHT NOW. NO ONE HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE SYSTEM BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY NAME IS. SURELY CRONE I'M A SENIOR ASSEMBLYMEMBERS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE AND I WAS HONORED TO HAVE ATTENDED A CONFERENCE DOWN IN LOS ANGELES. WHERE JANET AND HER COLLEAGUES FOR MAKING A PRESENTATION ABOUT THEIR STUDY? AND I SAID. THERE'S A BILL I'M GOING TO CARRY IT. AND I PROCEEDED TO PUT THAT BILL TOGETHER. AND THROUGH SOME CHANCES OF WHATEVER. THIS GUY HERE SAID A I WANT THAT. SO HE DID HE TOOK IN THE CITY'S GONNA AUTHOR IT. BUT I WOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL THAT WAS INTRODUCED A LACKED A WHOLE LOT OF DETAIL AND ALL OF THAT DETAIL HAS BEGUN TO COME TOGETHER. AND I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I'VE I THINK ARE IMPORTANT. WHEN WE WENT TO THE AGING COMMITTEE -- ONE OF THE MEMBERS. VEHEMENTLY I MEAN HE WAS SO STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUT HE SAYS YOU'VE GOT TO INCLUDE VETERANS. WITH THE HIGH SUICIDE RATES IN THE PTSD SITUATION YOU KNOW WITH VETERANS AND WHATNOT THEY NEED TO BE INCLUDED NOW CONSIDER THAT SOME OF OUR NOT IT NECESSARILY OLD. HERE THEY MAYBE FROM MORE COURAGE -- SITUATIONS BUT THEY STILL HAVE THE NEED FOR THESE SERVICES -- I SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE AND ENCOURAGE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS INTER PROVIDING INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE PROGRAMS. THAT AT THAT ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR SPECIFIC ISSUES. THESE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS CAN AND SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF OTHER AGENCIES FOR POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION. THIS IS WHERE I THINK ADVISORY BODIES SHOULD HAVE REGIONAL REPRESENTATION IN ADDITION TO STATE ORGANIZATIONS. SEEMS LIKE IF HE COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE HAVE BUILT SILOS AROUND WHAT THEY DO AND DON'T NECESSARILY SHARE WHAT THEY DO WITH OTHERS AND THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THERE'S SOME INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY OUT THERE THAT WE'RE NOT HEARING ABOUT. THAT OTHERS COULD POSSIBLY USE. SO HOW OFTEN. ARE WE OR WILL THERE BE AN AUDIT LIKE INTERVENTION TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME BEST PRACTICES EXPERIENCE LESSONS LEARNED NOT TO BE REPLICATED IN THE FUTURE. AND SPECIFICALLY HOW THE MONEY WAS ALLOCATED AND HOW IT WAS ACTUALLY USED ALONG WITH THE RESULTS. HAVING STATE LEVEL OVERSIGHT WILL ENSURE THAT THE BUDGET REQUESTED WAS ACTUALLY USED AS DESCRIBED IN THE REQUEST THIS IS WHERE AN OPPORTUNITY IS CREATED TO PUT THE SPOTLIGHT ON INNOVATIVE APPROACHES AND SUCCESSFUL AND CREATIVE IMPLEMENTATION. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. I URGE YOU. TO GIVE US AN AYE VOTE ON THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

I RESPECTFULLY ASK DRIVE VOTE CERTAINLY ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE HAVE WITH US -- TO FOLKS TO TEST BY MISTER RED. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THAT ALSO IS DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND ADVOCACY AT A BLACK FAMILY SERVICES WERE STATEWIDE CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE AGENCY. I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHARE WITH YOU THE BARRIERS ARE AGENCY PARTICULARLY OUR EMPLOYEES EXPERIENCE IN PROVIDING. DIRECT SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES DUE TO THE BURDEN SEND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR CHILDREN COVERED UNDER MEDICARE. WHO ARE SEEKING THE PST T. SERVICES -- I SHOULD NOTE THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH AGENCIES COMMISSIONED MTM SERVICES. TO CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS OF REQUIRED OUTPATIENT PROGRESS NO DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS FOR SIX COUNTIES IT INCLUDED ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA ORANGE MARIN MONTEREY AND CINEMA. AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND COMPARED IT TO THE STATES OF NEW YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS UNDER STATEWIDE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. BASED ON THE RIGOROUS REVIEW PROCESS UNDERTAKEN BY THE CONSULTANTS THEY FOUND THAT QUOTE A RELIABLE PICTURE EMERGE OF EXCESSIVE. DOCUMENTATION -- REQUIREMENTS IN CALIFORNIA -- ACCORDING TO THE REPORT THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR COMPLETING PAPERWORK IS FIVE MINUTES AND IN CALIFORNIA IT IS TWENTY MINUTES. AS THE WHITE AGENCY WE WORK IN THIRTY TWO COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND MOST IF NOT ALL REQUIRE DIFFERENT FORMS. COUNTY PAPER REPORTING ACCOUNTS AND THE SHEER VOLUME AND DUPLICATIVE NATURE OF REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION. HAS LED TO EMPLOYEE BURNOUT -- INCREASED FRUSTRATION AND PEOPLE LEAVING THE FIELD JUST AS WE'RE EXPERIENCING A STATE WAGE WORK FOR SHORTAGE. ON THE COUNTIES IN WHICH WE PROVIDE SERVICES -- TWO CHILDREN -- HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE DOCUMENTATION DATA REQUIREMENTS THERE ARE NO TWO COUNTIES THAT HAVE IDENTICAL DOCUMENTATION PACKAGES. THE COUNTIES ARE THE REQUIRE THEIR OWN FORMS OR A PRESCRIBED LIST OF DATA REQUIREMENTS. FOR AN AGENCY THAT OPERATES IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES THIS LEADS TO INEFFICIENCIES WITH DUNDON SEES AND COSTLY SERVICES -- WE KNOW THAT ARE TALENTED AND PROFESSIONAL STAFF -- CAME INTO THE FIELD OF SOCIAL WORK IN PSYCHOLOGY TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CARE FOR PEOPLE IN CRISIS. YET THE BURDEN SOME DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS HAS RESULTED IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS NOT GETTING ACCESS TO CRITICAL MENTAL HEARST HEALTH SERVICES AND TO LOW MORE -- STAFF MORALE AND BURN OUT -- WE APPRECIATE YOUR RIFLE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON TO THE COMMITTEE IN THE CHAIR THANK YOU -- I WANTED A URGED THE SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN SIXTY THREE AS A PRACTICING PSYCHOLOGIST I'M THE CHIEF OF PSYCHOLOGY AT TALK CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL -- I WANTED ADD JUST REVIEW THAT AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN SUFFER FROM A DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER DURING THEIR CHILDHOOD. AND CURRENTLY SUICIDE SERVES AS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH OF CHILDREN TEN TO FOURTEEN AS WELL AS FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE. AS CHAIRMAN WOULD POINTED OUT WE ARE -- IN A SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS -- AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS -- LIKE CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST TRAIN FOR ELEVEN YEARS -- FAMOUS PEDIATRICIANS -- THERE IS A SHORTAGE THERE AND THERE'S ONLY ABOUT -- TEN THOUSAND LICENSE CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST IN THE COUNTRY -- IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A A RESOURCE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO RETAIN AND YET WHEN WE HAVE AS ARE MY MY COLLEAGUE AS SAID -- WHEN WE HAVE ALL OF THIS PAPERWORK IT'S SO HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE -- BECAUSE WE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE LOW -- AND I HAVE ALL THIS PAPERWORK ON THERE ARE -- I'M JUST. POINTING OUT THESE ARE JUST THE ADMINISTRATIVE FORMS IT TAKES TO ENROLL SOMEONE INTO TREATMENT IT TAKES ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS -- JUST TO FIND OUT IF SOMEONE AS QUALIFIES FOR TREATMENT. AND AS A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST AS I SEE A CHILD -- IN IN TREATMENT AND DO WHAT IS THE THE EVIDENCE BASED THING TALK TO THE CHILD TO SUFFER DEPRESSION -- TALK TO THE PARENTS TALKED WITH THE SCHOOL TALK WITH THAT I HAVE -- WITH THEIR DOCTORS IF THEY HAVE A MEDICAL ILLNESS I HAVE TO FILL OUT SIX DIFFERENT NOTES FOR THAT ONE SESSION -- AND IF I GET ONE WORD WRONG ON THOSE NOTES IT DISQUALIFIES ALL OF THEM AND I'M NOT PAID -- AND IN FACT ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN ANOTHER COUNTY GOT ONE OF THEIR BILLS TONIGHT BECAUSE THEY BUILD FOR THE TIME THEY SPENT LISTENING TO THE PATIENT AND NOT JUST THE TIME THEY SPENT TALKING TO THE PATIENT. SO -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRAINING NEW NEW PROVIDERS WHICH IS -- IMPORTANCE WE ALSO FIND -- IT THAT WE'RE SPENDING TWICE AS LONG -- JUST TRAINING THEM HOW TO FILL OUT PAPERWORK THIS IS OUR MANUAL OF TEACHING THEM HOW TO DO PAPERWORK ALONE -- IN THE END I THINK WHAT WE FIND IS THE PROVIDERS SPENDING TIME SERVICING THE CHART INSTEAD OF SERVICING THE PATIENT. AND IF WE COULD REDUCE THE PAPER WORK WITHOUT EVEN INCREASING THE WORK FORCE WE COULD SERVE 30% MORE CHILDREN. I HAVE FIFTY KIDS ON THE WAITING LIST RIGHT NOW -- AS YOUNG AS SEVEN CHILDREN WITH CANCER WITH EPILEPSY WHO ARE NEEDING SERVICES DESPERATELY I COULD SEE THE MALL IF I COULD REDUCE THAT PAPERWORK THANK YOU SO MUCH I URGE A VOTE.

EIGHTEEN QUESTION RIGHT RIGHT -- I SHOULD ENTERTAIN THAT IN MY CLOTHES. WITH RESPECT TO THE ANALYSIS AND THE COMES ON THE ADULT POPULATION THAT MAKES LAWCENTER. THE ONLY CONCERN I WOULD HAVE IS THAT WE INSURE THAT WE GET THIS DONE IT MIGHT BE TWO SEPARATE WORKING GROUPS IT MIGHT BE A MATTER OF TIMING -- BUT I THINK YOU MAKE AN EXCELLENT POINT -- AND WE SHOULD EMBRACE THAT COULD WORK ON A POTENTIALLY THIS BILL OR TOGETHER LATER DATE.

ROSS AYE RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ AYE SANTIAGO [inaudible] WALDRON. YES SEVEN VOTES WILL THE BILL ON TOP DAY MISTER THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU -- SEE THIS IN THIS WAY [inaudible] SIX IT WAS REASONS. I DO SEE WAS PETRIE-NORRIS. HELLO CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB NINE TWENTY THE PURPOSE. OF THIS SPELL IS PROTECT PATIENTS WHO ARE IN RECOVERY FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF CALIFORNIA'S AS AMERICANS DEPLETE CRISIS IS TRULY STAGGERING ACCORDING TO THE CDC A HUNDRED AND THIRTY PEOPLE DIE IN THE UNITED STATES FROM OPIOIDS EVERY SINGLE DAY. THIS NOW MAKES OPIATE OVERDOSE A TOP FIVE CAUSE OF DEATH. IT'S HEARTBREAKING AND IT EVERY SINGLE STEP IT SEEMS THERE ARE UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS WHO ARE PROFITEERING FROM THE SUFFERING OF OTHERS. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES HAVE ENGAGED IN DECEPTIVE MARKETING PRACTICES DOCTORS WHO HAVE KNOWINGLY OVER PRESCRIBED THESE DRUGS. AN UNLICENSED RAPE REHABILITATION CENTER OPERATORS WHO ARE EXPLOITING PATIENTS FOR PROFIT. THERE IS MUCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BILLS MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. THAT ADDRESSING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS ISSUE I THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR PRO APPROPRIATE LICENSING AND OVERSIGHT OF FOR PROFIT DRUG REHABILITATION CENTERS WELL THERE ARE GOOD ACTORS IN THIS SPACE THAT ARE DOING POSITIVE WORK FOR THOSE SEEKING RECOVERY. UNSCRUPULOUS OPERATORS HAVE BEEN EXPLOITING PATIENTS TO READ HIGH PROFITS. THIS HORROR STORY PLAYS OUT TIME AND AGAIN THE PATIENT IS RECRUITED OUT OF STATE BY A BODY BROKER. OUT OF NETWORK INSURANCE POLICIES ARE PURCHASED FOR THE PATIENT AND THEN RUN UP TO THE TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. AFTER THIRTY SIXTY OR NINETY DAYS. THE I. INSURANCE RUNS OUT PATIENT IS CURBED TURN OUT IN THE STREETS AND EXACERBATING CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. SOMETIMES PATIENTS ARE EVEN ENCOURAGED TO RELAPSE IN ORDER FOR THE CYCLE TO BEGIN AGAIN. AND THE REASON THAT THE CYCLE IS POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE THERE'S A TOTAL LACK OF REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT. CURRENTLY REHAB CENTERS THAT SERVE SIX OR FEWER CLIENTS ARE AND LICENSED AND ENTIRELY UNREGULATED. UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA STATE LAW THESE FACILITIES ARE SPECIFICALLY TREATED AS SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE. I WENT SIX PEOPLE DECIDE TO LIVE TOGETHER IN A SOBER ENVIRONMENT IN ORDER TO FURTHER THEIR RECOVERY IT IS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE TO TREAT THIS AS A SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE. BUT WHEN A NETWORK EVERY HAVE HOMES ARE OWNED AND OPERATED BY A FOR PROFIT CORPORATION. THIS IS NOT A HOME THIS IS NOT A RESIDENTS THIS IS A BUSINESS. EIGHTY NINE TWENTY AIMS TO ADDRESS THE COMMERCIAL INCENTIVE DRIVING THESE UNSCRUPULOUS OPERATORS SPECIFICALLY AB NINE TWENTY CLARIFIES THAT SIX AND UNDER TREATMENT FACILITIES THAT ARE PART OF A LARGER BUSINESS NETWORK. I EAT IN AND ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP WITH A TREATMENT PROVIDER THAT OWNS OR OPERATES TWO OR MORE FACILITIES. IS A BUSINESS IN A RESIDENTIAL HOME. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT FOR THIS MEASURE AND TO AS A SIDE. LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON ADDRESSING MANY ASPECTS AS THE AGREED CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THERE'S A SUPPORT. OUR TIME IT DID NOT [inaudible] OKAY. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE CHAIR MEMBERS SHARE DATA FOR CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS. REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND DICTION FOCUSED COUNSELORS. AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED TRIP PROGRAMS AND SOBER LIVING THROUGHOUT THE STATE ALTHOUGH WE ARE RESPECTFULLY AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR ON THE CONTENTIONS THAT. THERE ARE ABUSES IN THE PATIENT BROKERING ASPECT OF THE BUSINESS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF EIGHTY NINE TWENTY DOES NOT ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL WE CREATE OUR MEMBERS AND FOUND THAT OVER 90% OF THEM. OWN MORE THAN. ONE FACILITY OR TYPE OF FACILITY SO IF THIS WERE TO GO INTO A FACT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT A MAJOR CATASTROPHE OF CONSTRUCTION. AND ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES -- IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR BUSINESSES TO OWN MORE THAN ONE TREATMENT PROGRAM. IF THEY'RE GOOD AT IT IF THEY'RE EFFECTIVE THERE SHOULD BE NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO OWN. MORE THAN. ONE REMOVING THEIR EIGHTY PROTECTION IN MANY COMMUNITIES WOULD BASICALLY PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. SO -- THAT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD IDEA ALSO THE CONSORTIUM OF CARE IS A CONTINUUM SO IT MAKES SENSE FOR A COMPANY. TO OWN A A DETOXIFICATION CENTER AND THEN PERHAPS AN INPATIENT CENTER AND THEN AN OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM AND MAYBE A SOBER LIVING SO THAT THEY COULD GUIDE PATIENTS THROUGH THEIR CARE -- IN ORGANIZATIONS THEY TRUST. THERE'S BEEN NO STUDY TO SHOW. THAT DO OWNERSHIP OF PROGRAMS OR DIFFERENT TYPES OF MODALITIES IS A HARM TO THE CUSTOMERS. WE WOULD WELCOME -- WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT SHE HAS PRESENTED TODAY BUT AS IT IS WRITTEN WE MUST POST THANK YOU. OR ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. IN OUR PRE PACKED THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTAKE OCCUR. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- SO I I AGREE THAT THERE'S PROBABLY GOOD ACTORS OUT THERE. BUT THE BAD ACTORS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM PUTTING PATIENTS CALL IT OF CARE AT RISK. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- THAT MAY BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN THIS BILL THAT COULD LIMIT ACCESS TO HOUSING FOR THESE VULNERABLE PEOPLE. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO EMPOWER ANY LOCAL GROUPS THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION TO HAVING THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL BUT I HOPE YOU CONSIDER HOW WE MIGHT ADDRESS THAT ACCESS ISSUE MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY. JUST RUMORS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN AND READ THE BILL HERE IS SOME OF THE TESTIMONY AS FAR AS SOME OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS A SOME OF THE ORDINANCES THAT PUT. CONSTRAINTS ON THE NUMBER OF SIZES THAT ARE THERE -- STARS TO LOOK AT HOW SOME OF THE DIFFERENT -- AREAS ARE SPARSELY -- IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE JURISDICTIONS OF THE CITIES THAT ARE THERE. AND SEEING THAT -- AND KNOWING. THE CONCERN THAT'S THERE IS MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS SOMEWHERE FOR SOMEONE TO GO FOR THE REHABILITATION SERVICES ARE THERE IN THE ONGOING -- REHABILITATION SERVICES FOR THEM -- IT'S ENCOURAGING TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE IN DIALOGUE WITH THE THE INDUSTRY -- TRYING. TO COME TO TERMS OF SOME OF THOSE -- QUESTIONS ARE THERE BUT I THINK AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION THE ORDINANCES THAT ARE THERE ARE SOME OF THOSE ORDINANCES A START TO PUSH -- HOUSE YOU KNOW TRANCE -- TRANSFORMATION HOUSING -- OUT INTO SOME AREAS I THINK NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT TO I WAS SUPPORTED TODAY -- BUT HOPEFULLY HERE THAT THERE'S ONGOING DIALOGUE. THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY AND I'LL CERTAINLY TAKE THAT ON BOARD AND I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. THAT THE AIM OF THIS BILL IS CERTAINLY NOT TO PUT GOOD OPERATORS OUT OF BUSINESS SO IN THE SAME WAY THAT WHEN WE HAVE REGULATIONS AS IN PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FOR EVERYTHING FROM RESTAURANTS. TO HEAR SIGNS. TO DOCTORS OFFICES THE GOAL IS NOT TO PUT THE GOOD ACTORS OUT OF BUSINESS THE GOAL IS TO PROTECT. THE PUBLIC AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. CAPACITY FOR TREATMENT SERVICES IS THIS CRISIS IS NOT YET IS NOT GETTING BETTER AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD CAPACITY. FOR TREATMENT SERVICES NOT JUST SOMETHING WHERE PEOPLE GET TRAPPED IN A CYCLE. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE OTHER FOR BRINGING THIS FOR THIS IS THAT TH LORD'S WORK -- IT IS -- INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT -- I CAN ATTEST I WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN WOULD YOU KNOW -- MY COUNTY -- WE HAD WORKED ON THIS -- YEARS AGO -- AND I KNOW THAT AN ORANGE COUNTY IT'S ALSO -- QUITE THE QUITE THE PROBLEM ON THE QUITE THE ISSUE -- AND SO KNOWING THAT YOU'RE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU -- FOR FOR TAKING IT IT UP -- AND AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU AND IS THAT IF I CAN BE SUPPORTIVE IN ANY WAY -- AND ANY INFORMATION -- I WOULD LOVE TO I'M SURE -- THIS IS -- BUT I STILL WANT TO CALL YOU SUPERVISOR RAMOS SO BUT MY AT THE SUMMIT MY MY COLLEAGUE FROM FROM SAM YOU KNOW COUNTY IT'LL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. I JUST WANT TO SAY A THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING A MORE FOR BILL FORD I'M SYMPATHETIC TO CONCERNS YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS -- THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS SOME PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED I'M WE SEEM PROGRESS THOUGH -- WITH THE PATIENT -- PROGRAM BILL WAS THAT FROM LAST YEAR AND YOUR BILL OF AB NINE NINETEEN THIS YEAR SEEKING ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT WAS PATIENT BROKERING. A LAWS AND THAT BILL WAS THAT THOSE ON CONSENT TONIGHT HOWEVER I FIND MYSELF IN THE SAME POSITION I HAVE BEEN OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. ON SIMILAR BILLS I CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT THAT INDIVIDUALS RECOVERY FROM ALCOHOL AND DRUG DEPENDENCY PROBLEMS ARE PROTECTED UNDER THE FEDERAL AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT AND OF AND FAIR HOUSING ACTS AS WELL AS THE STATE'S FAIR HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT LAWS. SO FOR THIS REASON I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- BUT I ENCOURAGE ALL OF THIS CONTINUE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO BETTER ENSURE THE SAFETY AND PROTECTION. OF OF RECOVERY CLIENTS WERE PROTECTING THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF THOSE SUFFERING FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS -- WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE ABSOLUTELY SO I I'VE JUST FIRST ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS YOU RAISED IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL CONFLICT WITH. AND THE EIGHTY A AN FHA AND SO WE HAS REACHED OUT TO LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL WE KNOW WITH THAT VERY QUESTION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WHEN IT CROSSED SOMETHING THAT. I IS IN LINE WITH THE ADA AND THE FHA ARE THEY SO FAR GIVEN AS AN INFORMAL OPINION THAT EIGHTY NINE TWENTY HAS BEEN CRAFTED. SPECIFICALLY TO AVOID POTENTIAL ISSUES IT'S BEEN CRAFTED VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED ON ALCOHOL AND AND DRUG ABUSE RECOVERY FACILITIES. THAT DO YOU HAVE -- THE RECOVERY ASPECT NOT YOU'RE JUST A HOME SO FOR THAT REASONTHEY THINK THAT BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE FOCUSED ON THAT PARTICULAR ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP. THAT THIS WILL IN FACT BE IN LINE WITH THE ADA AN FHA AND WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR FORMAL OPINION. TO DISSONANT THOUGHT AND OBVIOUSLY WILL CONTINUE. TO AS THIS BILL HOPEFULLY MOVES THROUGH -- TO INSURE THAT WE TAKE ON ANY NECESSARY AMENDMENTS SO THAT IT'S NOT IN CONFLICT WITH. EXISTING LAW. I'M AND I THINK WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY IS. I THINK THEY'RE REALLY SIMPLE FACT IS THAT IN SO MANY WAYS I JUST FEEL LIKE. OUR FRAMEWORKS. FOR TREATMENT ARE FRAMEWORKS FOR REGULATION ARE FRAMEWORKS FOR DEALING WITH THIS CRISIS ACROSS THE BOARD HAVE NOT CAUGHT UP TO THE REALITY OF WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE FACING AND WHAT WE'RE CONFRONTING. I'M AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE CONCERNS THAT YOU RAISED AND I REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO CRAFT A SOLUTION THAT. ULTIMATELY DOING WE ALL WANT TO DO WHICH IS MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HELPING AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE GET GET WELL AND GET THEIR LIVES BACK ON TRACK SO. I'M IT WITH THAT I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S TIME TO ENACT THE SAME KIND OF LEGISLATIVE PROTECTIONS. FOR PEOPLE BATTLING ADDICTION THAT ARE IN PLACE FOR PATIENTS FACING ANY OTHER MEDICAL CHALLENGE ON AN EIGHTY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I'VE.

RODRIGUEZ HI SANTIAGO. WALDRON. YOU HAVE SIX VOTES THE BILLS ON CALL ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH -- MISS RAMOS I'M SORRY MISS WICKS EXCUSE ME I'M SORRY I DIDN'T SEE POP IN THERE. THIS CASE IS W. W. BEFORE OUR HI. WELCOME THANKS FOR COMING. READY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY. I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS -- REQUESTED BY THE COMMITTEE WHICH WOULD BE ONE NICK EXCLUDING MEDI CAL FROM THE BILL. TO DELETING REFERENCES TO SMALL GROUP TO EXPLICITLY APPLY THIS BILL TO LARGE GROUP COVERAGE. THREE ADDING ADDING THREE IVF CYCLES AND UP TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS -- COVERAGE LIMITATION -- FOURTH ADDING A LIFETIME LIMITATION AND LASTLY -- MAKE THESE CHANGES TO BOTH HEALTH AND SAFETY INSURANCE CODE SO I WILL BE ACCEPTING THOSE MOMENTS. AS REQUESTED BY THE COMMITTEE. SO WHAT WHEN I WAS IN MY EARLY THIRTIES. I WAS WORKING A HUNDRED HOURS A WEEK YEAH [inaudible] THANKS -- TWENTY WORKING A HUNDRED HOURS A WEEK HELPED ELECT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE LAST THING ON MY MIND WAS ON IT WHEN I WANTED TO HAVE A FAMILY. BUT NEVERTHELESS I VISITED A FERTILITY DOCTOR AT THE ADVICE OF A FRIEND -- AND I GOT THE NEWS THAT MY FOLLICLE COUNT WAS LOW. AND I HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH OVARIAN DYSFUNCTION. AND KNOWING THAT I WAS YEARS AWAY -- FROM WANTING TO HAVE A FAMILY MIGHT MY DOCTOR HAD RECOMMEND FREEZING MY EGGS. BECAUSE I WAS LIVING IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. WHICH REQUIRES I'VE YOU HAVE TO BE COVERED BY LAW -- MY INSURANCE WAS REQUIRED TO COVER SALANDER WENT EGG FREEZING I WAS LUCKY BUT NOT MANY CALIFORNIANS HERE IN THE STATE ARE LUCKY. FOR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO SUFFER FROM INFERTILITY OPTIONS ARE LIMITED ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. AND THIS BILL AIMS TO CHANGE THAT. IN MOST CLINICAL CONTEXT INFERTILITY IS DEFINED AS THE INABILITY TO BECOME PREGNANT AFTER TWELVE MONTHS OF TRYING TO CONCEIVE WITHOUT CONTRACEPTIVES. THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF GYNECOLOGISTS AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ALL RECOGNIZE INFERTILITY IS A DISEASE. WELL ONE IN EIGHT COUPLES ARE IMPACTED BY THE DISEASE AND HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING PREGNANT OR SUSTAINING A PREGNANCY EXISTING STATE LAW LIMITS THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THOSE SUFFERING FROM INFERTILITY. BY SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING IVF TREATMENTS. THE STATE MANDATED EXCLUSION EXIST DESPITE A MULTITUDE OF EVIDENCE THAT SUGGEST THAT IVF IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR INFERTILITY INFERTILITY THAT RESULTS IN INCREASED PREGNANCY RATES AND LIVE BIRTH RATES. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF TWO STATES IN THE NATION TO EXPLICITLY EXCLUDE IVF FOR COVERAGE. LOUISIANA IS THE OTHER STATE. NINE OTHER STATES INCLUDE SOME FORM OF IVF COVERAGE WE CAN JOIN THOSE NINE STATES IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THIS BY REQUIRING LARGE GROUP PLANS TO COVER IVF TREATMENT. THE AMENDMENTS THAT I HAVE AGREED TO TAKE WILL HELP ADDRESS THE COST THAT WAS RAISED IN THE CHAMBER OF ANALYSIS WE BELIEVE SO SIGNIFICANTLY. AND I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. WITH THESE NARROW PROVISIONS AB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN WILL HELP HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM. INFERTILITY ACCESS INFERTILITY IVF TREATMENT -- THROUGH THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS AND WHILE THIS BILL IS NOT PERFECT I IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO HELP FAMILIES THAT SO DESPERATELY NEEDED FAMILIES THAT WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN AND I DO BELIEVE. FAMILIES COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES BLENDED FAMILIES ADOPTED CHILDREN -- ALL KINDS OF WAYS BUT IVF IS ONE WAY THAT WE CAN -- ALLOW FOLKS TO HAVE. A FAMILY HAVE CHILDREN SO I WOULD RESPECTIVELY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I WILL LET ME WITNESSES SELF INTRODUCE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR SUSAN WOMAN AND I'M PLEASED TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB. SEVEN SIX SEVEN I'VE HAD TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN PROVIDING FERTILITY CARE. I RECENTLY RETIRED FROM THE REAP AT THE SCIENCE CENTER IN SAN RAMON WHICH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST SUCCESSFUL IVF CLINICS IN CALIFORNIA. AND NOW FUNCTION IN PART TIME CRACKED A PART TIME OF ROLE AS A CONSULTANT FOR THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER. I SPEAK TODAY AS A MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE AND A PROFESSIONAL MEMBER OF RESOLVE. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO EDUCATE THE MEMBERS ON SOME BASIC FACTS. FIRST INFERTILITY IS A RECOGNIZED DISEASE OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. SECOND THE INFERTILITY IS PREVALENT IN THE UNITED STATES INFERTILITY AFFECTS ABOUT SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE OR POPULATION. THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE INFERTILITY AFFECTING BOTH MEN. AND WOMEN. AND THEY HAVE A WIDE RANGING IMPLICATIONS OF HEALTH ISSUES THAT OVERLAP WITH INFERTILITY. THE PRESENT STATE OF OUR HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE IS THAT IT TREATS SOME MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CONDITIONS. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO INFERTILITY IT EXCLUDES THAT TREATMENT. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT IN VITRO FERTILIZATION IS THE STANDARD CARE FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT OF REFRACTORY INFERTILITY. AND IT IS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. FOR EXAMPLE FOR THIRTY YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO UNDERGOES IVF SHE HAS A 49% CHANCE OF LIFE BIRTH. IN THE SECOND TREATMENT CYCLE THERE ARE FEW MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS THAT REPORT SUCH A HIGH SUCCESS RATE. HOWEVER LACK INSURANCE FOR THIS MEDICAL CONDITION RELAYS THE RESULT IN A DELAY OF EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. BECAUSE A WOMAN'S REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL DECREASES WITH AGE DELAYING INTERVENTION DUE TO PERSONAL FINANCES RESULT IN A LOWER SUCCESS RATE AND AN OVERALL HIGHER COST PER LIVE BIRTH. WITHOUT INSURANCE COVERAGE PATIENTS OPERA LESS EXPENSIVE TREATMENTS BUT SINCE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EFFECTIVE AND THOSE SECONDARY OPTIONS -- SO SEE WITH HIGHER RISK OF COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS THE TOPIC PREGNANCY AND MULTIPLE BIRTH. FINALLY INSURANCE COVERAGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER PREGNANCY OUTCOMES LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS RELATED TO DELIVERY AN INFANT CARE PRIMARILY BY FOSTERING BETTER AND SOUND MEDICAL PRACTICES SUCH AS SINGLE EMBRYO TRANSFER WHICH REDUCES PRETERM DELIVERY RATES [inaudible] NOT. N. MANDATED STATES WOMEN UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE YEARS OUR SINGLE EMBRYO TRANSFER THAT A WOMAN IN A NON MANDATED STATE. INFERTILITY PHYSICIANS AND THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE SUPPORT INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR INFERTILITY JUST LIKE ANY OTHER MEDICAL CONDITION. I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO PASS EIGHTY SEVEN SIX SEVEN THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MY NAME IS CINDY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CINDY FLAN HI I AM HERE TODAY AS A PATIENT. IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN I WAS. TWENTY SIX MY HUSBAND I BEGAN TO START BEGAN TRYING TO START A FAMILY. WE TRIED TO CONCEIVE FOR NEARLY A YEAR AND A HALF WITHOUT SUCCESS BEFORE MY DOCTOR TESTED US FOR INFERTILITY. IT TURNED OUT THAT THE MEDICAL CONDITION WAS IN WITH ME. IT WAS WITH MY HUSBAND. WE HAD EXCELLENT INSURANCE AND ASSUME THAT BECAUSE WE'RE TREATING A MEDICAL CONDITION OR DISEASE. EVERYTHING WOULD BE COVERED. I WAKE UP CALL CAME SOON AFTER THAT. ONCE OUR CONDITION WAS COATED IN THE SYSTEM AS INFERTILITY WE WERE DONE. OUR HEALTH PLAN. IMMEDIATELY DID AN ABOUT FACE AND DENIED COVERAGE TELLING US THAT SINCE THEY DIDN'T COVER INFERTILITY WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR ALL TREATMENTS OUT OF POCKET. WE WERE REFERRED TO REPRODUCTIVE AND ENDOCRINOLOGIST BUT EVEN WITH THE REFERRAL OUR INSURANCE WOULD NOT COVER EVEN THE COST OF THE CONSULTATION. EVERY TEST NEEDED FROM NOW ON WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID OUT OF POCKET. EVEN IF IT WAS A TEST THAT INSURANCE WOULD NORMALLY COVER. BEFORE WE EVEN AT THE SPECIALIST WE HAD ALREADY SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. THEN CAME THE TREATMENT OPTIONS. ALL OF WHICH WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID FOR OUT OF POCKET. IN VITRO FERTILIZATION WHICH HAS THE HIGHEST LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS WOULD COST ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. WE SPENT THE NEXT THREE YEARS SCRAPING TOGETHER THE MONEY TO PAY FOR FERTILITY TREATMENTS. EVEN THOUGH THE LINE TREATMENT PUT US EVEN MORE AT RISK. AFTER FOR TEN USING INTRAUTERINE INSEMINATION AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL COSTS. ARE DOCTOR SUGGESTED WE MOVE ON TO IN VITRO. I REMEMBER LOOKING AT OUR DOCTOR THAT DAY. AND SAYING THIS IS IT WE'RE OUT OF MONEY. WE'RE LITERALLY GIVING YOU ALL THE MONEY WE HAVE. WE HAD SPENT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER THE SIX YEARS WE HAVE BEEN TRYING. TO HAVE A BABY AND WE WERE BROKE. OUR INSURANCE COVER NOTHING. WE WERE LUCKY BECAUSE I LAST CYCLE WAS SUCCESSFUL. MY SON IS SEVEN YEARS OLD TODAY. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW GRATEFUL I AM THAT WE HAVE HIM. STILL TODAY MY SON OFTEN ASKS WHY HE DOESN'T HAVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS. AND WHILE YES THE ANSWER IS THAT IT'S BECAUSE WERE INFERTILE. THE TRUTH IS THAT WE CAN'T. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO TREAT WHAT IS A TREATABLE DISEASE BECAUSE INSURANCE WON'T COVER IT. MY STORY IS NOT UNIQUE. OVER THE FIFTEEN YEARS I'VE BEEN A PART OF MANY OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. I'VE BEEN A PART OF MANY INFERTILITY SUPPORT GROUPS BOTH VIRTUAL IN PERSON. I HAD THE HONOR TO SUPPORT OTHER STRIVING FOR PARENTHOOD. MANY WHO OF WALK THE SAME PATH AS ME. AND HAVE NOT ENDED UP AS A MOTHER OR FATHER. I'VE WATCHED COUPLE SELL THEIR HOMES. LOSE THEIR HOMES. BORROW FROM FAMILY. START GO FIND THESE. WHOLE FUNDRAISERS AND GARAGE SALES WORK MULTIPLE JOBS. WHEN I TOLD MY ONLINE SUPPORT GROUPS THAT I WOULD BE TESTIFYING TODAY? RESPONSES INCLUDED WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE FAMILY WE DO IF NOT FOR MANDATED COVERAGE IN MASSACHUSETTS. AND THE ONLY REASON I HAVE MY KIDS IS BECAUSE ILLINOIS AS A MANDATE STATE. CALIFORNIANS WONDER IF PEOPLE IN MASSACHUSETTS AND ILLINOIS CAN HAVE A FAMILY WHY CAN'T WE FOR I HOPE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WILL STAND UP FOR US TODAY FOR OUR DREAMS OUR HOPES. AND YES OUR RIGHT TO HAVE A FAMILY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS A SUPPORT.

THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. SIR ANYONE IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JENNIFER ALLEY WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS REPRESENTING FORTY FIVE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS THAT COLLECTIVELY. DELIVER HEALTH PROVIDE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS -- CAP MUST OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT INCREASE WILL INCREASE THE COST OF LARGE CHECK GROUP PREMIUMS WELL WE SYMPATHIZE WITH THIS ISSUE -- YEAH WE HAVE A EXTREME PRICE SENSITIVITY TO OF THE COST OF NEW MANDATES AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE. THE AMENDMENTS TO NARROW THIS BILL WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED -- CURRENT LAW REQUIRES LARGE GROUP PLANS TO OFFER COVERAGE FOR INFERTILITY THIS APPROACH ALLOWS EMPLOYERS -- TO PROVIDE THIS COVERAGE TO THEIR MERRILEES IF THEY CHOOSE -- TO YOU KNOW AND IF IF THE AUTHOR ACCEPTS THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- THERE WOULD NEED TO BE ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS -- TO ESTIMATE THE COST IMPACT ON THE LARGE GROUP MARKET -- AND AS SAID EARLIER WITH OTHER MANDATE BILLS WE JUST REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS IS THE WRONG TIME TO ESTABLISH NEW MANDATES FOR COVERAGE THANK YOU. STEPHANIE WATKINS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE TO WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND FORTUNATELY. WELL WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF EMPATHY FOR THE STORIES THAT WE'VE ALL HEARD. I THINK PUTTING AN ADDITIONAL MANDATE ON LARGE GROUP EMPLOYERS WHO VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. IS CERTAINLY AT THE WRONG TIME TO DO THAT I THINK THE ALSO THING THAT WE'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IS. IT ME ADDITIONALLY SUBJECT THEM TO THE EXCISE TAX IT'S DUE TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT HAS BEEN DELAYED SEVERAL TIMES BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY A THE CURRENT PRICES OF HEALTH CARE IN THE LARGE GROUP MARKET. WOULD FURTHER ENCOURAGE LARGE EMPLOYERS TO CONSIDER SELF INSURING AND THAT WOULD TAKE THEM OUT OF THE OVERSIGHT OF CALIFORNIAN PUT THEM UNDER THE FEDERAL RESERVE RULES SO CERTAINLY FOR THOSE REASONS WERE CONCERNED. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT LARGE EMPLOYERS OFTEN DO CHOOSE TO HAVE VERY ROBUST COVERAGE AND DO YOU AS AS THIS IS A MANDATORY OFFERING CAN OFFER THIS IN ADDITION TO YOU AS A WRITER ON THEIR POLICY. WE WILL BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND SEE IF THERE'S SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO COME TO SOME COMMON GROUND BUT RIGHT NOW AS IT AS A MANDATE ON LARGE EMPLOYERS CERTAINLY A CONCERN IN A PRICE SENSITIVITY. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH IN IT INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO PURCHASE HEALTH CARE. WE'RE INCREDIBLY PRICE SENSITIVE AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE. OTHERS AND OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. KAREN CIRCUITS IN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND IN UP AS OPPOSITION. JOHN WHEN YOU'RE ON THE F.

MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE SO LATE TODAY -- I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO A FAMILY NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CHILD THAT WANTS. ONE AND I KNOW THE STRUGGLES OF WANTING TO HAVE A SECOND CHILD AND NOT BEING ABLE TO MAYBE A FOR THAT -- BECAUSE THE COST IS SO HIGH JUST TO GET THEIR I OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT THIS BILL I KNOW IT IS YOU HAD TO TAKE SOME DIFFICULT AMENDMENTS. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONTENT CONSIDER CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THIS I THINK THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. AND GOD KNOWS THAT IF I HAD KNOWN I COULD MOVE TO ANOTHER STATE AND HAVE THEM PAY FOR IT I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE [inaudible] ON BUT BUT IT IS IMPORTANTAND IT IS A QUALITY OF LIFE AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE COST SENSITIVE HERE BUT WE SHOULD ALSO BE FAMILY SENSITIVE AND SENSITIVE TO THE STRUGGLES OF OF OF THE CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND OF OTHER STATES CAN AFFORD IT I'M SURE WE CAN. FIND A WAY -- TO IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO BE A MOM. AND AND NO ONE UNDERSTANDS THAT BETTER THAN I DO I STRUGGLED FOR TEN YEARS TO BE HERE SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU FOR COMING AND SPEAKING IN SUPPORT AN OUTLOOK FOR DEVOTING ON THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND AUTHORSHIP ON THIS AS WELL [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. STRUGGLES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL AND THIS IS THE ONE AREA THAT -- I WANTED. TO GET SOME CLARITY ON THIS IS THAT THIS BILL DELETE SOME EXEMPTIONS FOR THE RELIGIOUS -- ORGANIZATIONS AND FREEDOM ON THOSE AREAS IS THERE STILL ONGOING DIALOGUE AS FAR AS TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT COMPONENT OF IT. HAPPY. TO WELL. HAVE YOU TO WORK WITH YOU ON YOUR AND YOUR OFFICE ON AND CHAT MORE ABOUT IT THANK YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING THAT WITH SHARKS. THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. I JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS -- I WILL I WILL TELL YOU IN PRACTICE OF THAT THE BILL DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION BUT I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND SOME CONCERNS -- I'D VERY MUCH APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND AND AND THIS AND THE TESTIMONY THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT I I KNOW. AS A PARENT -- HOW VALUABLE WITH -- THE VALUABLE BUT HOW AMAZING IT IS TO BE A PARENT -- AND THAT'S WHY I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE -- I THINK YOU'VE HEARD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT COST AND AND I TOPSY COSTLY TO PROVIDE -- TO PAY FOR THIS CARE BUT THERE'S ALSO OTHER OTHER COSTS AND AND AND A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNFORESEEN COSTS THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH WITH A BENEFIT LIKE THIS -- THERE YOU KNOW THERE ARE RISKS OF A HIGH RISK OF MULTIPLE PREGNANCY MULTIPLE -- HIGH RISK PREGNANCIES -- MULTIPLE BIRTHS -- PREMATURE BIRTHS AS THE CALIFORNIA. BENEFITS REVIEW -- PROGRAM POINTS OUT A PARTICULAR I WITH IVF AN OVULATION STIMULATING MEDICATIONS INCREASE RISK OF MULTIPLE GESTATION PREGNANCIES. WHICH ASSOCIATE WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF MATERNAL -- AND PERINATAL CON COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING PER CLAMP SCEA PRETERM BIRTH AND LOW BIRTH WEIGHT SO THOSE. ADD ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL COSTS AND I'M I ONLY SEE THAT TO POINT IT OUT BUT BUT AS I THINK. WE CAN'T IGNORE THAT YEAH NO I I I WOULD LET MY WITNESS BECAUSE THE HEALTH CARE EXPERT. THERE ARE PUBLISHED STUDIES THAT DEMONSTRATE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF INSURANCE MANDAED COVERAGE FOR INFERTILITY. BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE IDEA OF COVERAGE THEN YOU MAKE SOUND MEDICAL DECISIONS IN IDEA PRACTICING YOU HAVE. A LOWER INCIDENCE OF MULTIPLE BIRTHS A LOWER INCIDENCE OF PRETERM BIRTH AND A LOWER INCIDENCE OF MATERNAL COMPLICATIONS. SO WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS HIS IDEA PREGNANCY RATES HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF EMBRYOS TRANSFERRED HAS DECREASED. BUT IN NON MANDATED STATES OKAY THERE'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR A POSITION TO WORK AGAINST THAT PRESSURE FROM THE PATIENT WHO THINKS THAT. PUTTING TWO EMBRYOS BUT BACK IN THE UNIVERSE IS BETTER THAN. ONE BECAUSE THEY WANT THAT EXTRA FIVE OR 7% PREGNANCY RATE WHEN THEY'VE GOT INSURANCE COVERAGE AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN TRY AGAIN. THEY'RE MUCH MORE WILLING TO SPACE OUT THOSE. THAT THAT TREATMENT OVER TIME BECAUSE THEY KNOW ULTIMATELY THEY'LL BECOME SUCCESSFUL. SEVERAL PUBLISHED REPORTS THAT CHAU PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS ARE REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS REDUCE DIRECT DO. TO DECREASED RISK OF PRETERM DELIVERY AND THERE IS ADVANCE ADVANCES MADE WITH EMBRYO FREEZING. AND WE'RE FINDING IS THAT IF WE CAN FREE SURPLUS EMBRYOS ENTRANCE AND THEN FROZEN CYCLE LOWER RISK OF COMPLICATIONS IN PREGNANCY AS WELL. SO ARE THERE IS EXISTING STATE REGULATIONS AROUND IVF. THERE ARE NOT EXISTING STATE REGULATIONS I KNOW ABOUT NUMBERS OF ANDREAS TO TRANSFER THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY IS VERY SENSITIVE IT TO IT AND THEY PROMOTED AND WANTED VERY MUCH. AND WHEN THEY HAVE THE THE ABILITY TO ADVOCATE FOR THAT WAS SOUND MEDICAL PRACTICE THROUGH BETTER ABLE TO CONVINCE PATIENTS FOLLOW THAT. THAT SOUND MEDICAL ADVICE. SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY LOWER RISK. WHEN YOU HAVE A MANDATE COVERAGE FOR IDEA? THAT WILL TAKE TIME THOUGH -- FOUR FOUR BEHAVIORS TO CHANGE NOW IT LOOKS IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T TAKE TIME AT ALL. YEAH BUT THE FINISH OF YOU DON'T WANT -- SO I SO I'M ASKING YOU KNOW I KNOW THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL -- HAVE RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES SO YOU HAVE RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES FOR THIS. ARE THERE IS THERE ANY STATE OVERSIGHT -- FOR EXISTING -- EXISTING FOR FERTILITY CLINICS AND CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I LOOK AT THE CASE WE HAD YOU KNOW. EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT BIRTH IN A A A BIRTH OF A BABY SO YOU KNOW. I JUST THINK YEAH SHE HAD INSURANCE COVERAGE -- BUT NO THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW AREAS OF MEDICINE THAT ACTUALLY IS REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. EVERY CYCLE OF IVF THAT THE START IS REPORTED TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL WE HAVE A SISTER ORGANIZATION THE SOCIETY FOR ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY. THAT MONITORS ALL THIS AND IT IS AMAZING BECAUSE THAT THE DOCTORS IN THIS FIELD SPECIALIZED IN THIS. SO THE LEARNING CURVE IS SO DIFFERENT IN THIS AREA AND THE ACCEPTANCE AND THAT THE CHANGE IN PRACTICE. IS IS SO GREAT COMPARED TO OTHER AREAS OF MEDICINE IT DOESN'T TAKE TEN YEARS TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THEM THE PROFESSIONAL GUIDELINES SO THERE REALLY. PROBABLY ONE OF THE MORE DATA DRIVEN AREAS OF MEDICINE. THERE ARE THERE ARE RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES BY A SURROUND LIKE PERSONALLY. YEAH I WAS I BUT I WAS LOOKING ARE THERE ANY STATE REGULATIONS OR THE RAINY AND AND SORT YOUR FEDERAL. AND SO THAT MAKES ME GO BACK AND WONDER AT SOME POINT IF. YOU KNOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS -- THAT WE DO -- LOOK AT POTENTIAL STATE STATE GUIDELINES ON THIS. I'M SORRY I THIS THIS IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH MY FAITH COMPLETELY IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- SPECIALLY RIGHT NOW THE WELL. AND AND WE'RE ALSO HAPPY TO LOOK AT OTHER STATES AND SEE WHAT THEY'VE ADOPTED AND AND KEEP TALKING WITH YOUR STAFF AND YOUR AYE NEWS YOURSELF ABOUT SOME OF THE STUFF. AND I GUESS AND I GUESS IT GOES BACK TO MY ORIGINAL COMMENTS ABOUT THE THE UNFORESEEN POTENTIAL COST OF CARE. OF OF OTHER CARE AS WE'RE TRANSITIONING TO A POINT WHERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE MORE -- WE HAVE COVERAGE FOR THIS -- IT'S STILL GOING TO TAKE AWHILE BEHAVIOR DOESN'T TRACK. MEDICAL BEHAVIOR ISN'T CHANGED QUICKLY I WILL TELL YOU THAT FROM FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND SO. SO THEY'RE STILL WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME OF THESE ON FOR SEEING COSTS THAT THAT WILL BE A PART OF THE SYSTEM. AND SO I'M SAYING THIS I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S FURTHER WORK TO DO HERE AND AND THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT COSTS AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. OKAY ALL RIGHT -- FOR ANY OTHER COME -- THE BILL DOES HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISS CARILLO AND A SECOND BY MISS BURKE -- MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES? AGUIAR-CURRY AGUIAR-CURRY I BIGELOW [inaudible] BONTA BURKE [inaudible] CARILLO [inaudible] FLORA [inaudible] LIMON [inaudible] THIRTY THIS AREA RAMOS.

TODAY I PRESENT AB EIGHT TWENTY SIX WHICH ENSURES ADEQUATE AND TIMELY ACCESS TO SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR FOSTER YOUTH WERE PLACED OUT OF COUNTY YOU SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS KNOWN AS S. T. R. T. PEAS. BUT BEFORE I START I WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS OUR COUNTY PARTNERS FOR WORKING TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER I'M HAPPY TO BE AMENDING. THE BILL. AS A RESULT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. OVER THE PAST YEAR THE SAM ASSEMBLY HUMAN SERVICES SCOPE A COMMITTEE WHICH I SHARE HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON THE PROVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR FOSTER YOUTH. IN EBRUARY OF THIS YEAR OUR COMMITTEE HELD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER. WHICH OCCURS WHEN A YOUTH IS PLACED OUTSIDE OF THEIR COUNTY OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION. SPECIFICALLY PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER IS A PROCESS BY WHICH THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ARRANGEMENT AND PROVISION OF SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FOSTER USE. PLACED OUT OF COUNTY IS TRANSFERRED FROM THE COUNTY OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION TO THE COUNTY IN WHICH A YOUTH IS PLACED. KNOWN AS THE COUNTY OF RESIDENCE. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS THE LEGISLATURE WITH OUR YOUTH STATE COUNTY AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS WORK TO TRANSFORM THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THROUGH CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM OR C. C. R.. A KEY TENET OF CCAR'S TO ENSURE THAT ALL YOU'D HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW UP NOT IN AN INSTITUTIONAL SETTING BUT IN A LOVING FAMILY HOME THAT MEETS THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH. NEEDS OF FOSTER YOUTH PLACED AN OUT OF COUNTY CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS AB EIGHT TO SIX ACCOMPLISHES SEVERAL THINGS. FIRST IT ENSURES ADEQUATE AND TIMELY PROVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FOSTER YOU. BY PROVIDING FOR PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER ONLY IN CERTAIN. SITUATIONS AND BASED ON APPROPRIATENESS FOR THE YOUTH SECOND IT PROVIDES A MORE STRUCTURED UNIFORM PROCESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHEN A COUNTY PROVIDES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FOSTER YOU. BY REQUIRING THE DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDIZED FORMS IMPOSING NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND IMPLEMENTING TIME LINES BY WHICH CERTAIN TASKS MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED. AND THIRD IT PROMOTES TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING DH CS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. TO COLLECTED MAKE AVAILABLE CERTAIN DATA REGARDING THE PROVISION OF SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FOSTER YOUTH PLACED OUT OF COUNTY. THE PURPOSE VULNERABLE YOU WITH THE SERVICES SUPPORTS AND CARE THAT THEY NEED TO TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD. THAT AND LEAVE SUCCESSFUL FULFILLING LIVES AB EIGHT TWENTY SIX FURTHERS THIS PURPOSE.

IT'S A REALLY CRITICAL ISSUE TO ENSURE THAT OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM RECEIVE TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY ALL HAVE SUFFERED TRAUMA AND NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE ABUSE OR NEGLECT EVEN JUST THE REMOVAL FROM THE HOME. SO WE WERE PART OF THE GROUP THAT WORKED ON AB TWELVE NINETY NINE SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND SUPPORTED THAT BILL. AND IT AFFECTS BOTH FOSTER FAMILY HOME PLACEMENTS AND RELATIVE PLACEMENTS AND ALSO THE S. T. R. T. P. PLACEMENTS THAT THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON THAT'S THE AREA WHERE WE REALLY HEARD THE CONCERNS ABOUT TIMELINESS. AND ABOUT COMMUNICATION SO THIS BILL REALLY SEEKS TO ADDRESS THAT LEVEL OF ISSUE THE AMENDMENTS -- SORT OF PUT THE PRESUMPTION THEY MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A CLEAR REASON TO TRANSFER THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THAT NEW COUNTY AND THEY ENHANCE THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN COUNTY -- CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES AND MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY -- AGENCIES AND ALSO THE CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES THEMSELVES -- WE'RE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THANK YOU.

TO AND QUALITY OF CARE [inaudible] AND WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AHEAD IN START FIRST HI MY NAME IS LEE AND ARCHDEACON. AND I'M FROM EL DORADO HILLS. I LIVE THERE WITH MY THREE CHILDREN. FOR THIRTEEN YEARS MY HUSBAND AND I WANTED TO START A FAMILY BY MEANS OF ADOPTION. AFTER MANY CLASSES BACKGROUND CHECKS FROM STUDIES WE FINALLY RECEIVED THE CALL FROM THE SOCIAL WORKER THAT CHANGED OUR LIVES FOREVER. ABOUT A MONTH LATER WE FOUND OURSELVES IN A HOSPITAL ROOM HOLDING OUR ADOPTED NEWBORN. BABY BOY. WHO MEET TOGETHER NAMES AS AN ADOPTIVE FAMILY? ALONG WITH -- THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER NICOLAS. NICOLAS CRIED UNCONTROLLABLY WHEN THE HOSPITAL AND HE SEEMS SLIGHTLY YELLOW. BUT WE WERE SURE THAT THIS IS NORMAL. ABOUT THREE MONTHS AFTER HE WAS BORN. NICHOLAS GOT REALLY SICK WITH A RESPIRATORY VIRUS. HE SEEMED TO HAVE NEVER FULLY RECOVERED AND CONTINUOUSLY BEING PRESCRIBED READING TREATMENTS. AS WELL AS NEVER ENDING ANTIBIOTICS. ORAL STEROIDS SEEM TO BE ENERGY SHORTLY AFTER AND IT SEEMED TO MAKE HIM MORE COMFORTABLE BUT THE CRYING AND SCREAMING CONTINUED. I CONTINUE TO QUESTION PEDIATRICIANS NURSES AND ANYONE WHO WOULD JUST LISTEN TO MY STORY. I WAS ADVISED THAT BECAUSE I'M A FIRST TIME MOM. THAT THIS IS NORMAL. WHEN NICHOLAS WAS CLOSE TO THREE YEARS OLD? I MADE THE DECISION TO FINALLY SWITCHED PEDIATRICIANS. IT WASN'T VERY LONG AFTER THAT WE FINALLY HEARD. A DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS. HIS PEDIATRICIANS RAN LABS MADE CALLS TO HIS COLLEAGUES AND THEN REFERRED. US TO A GASTRO INTERNALLY JUST IN PALO ALTO. NICHOLAS WAS ADMITTED TO THE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL. INTEL HIS OXYGEN LEVELS BEGIN STABLE AND THEN WAS REFER TO LUCILLE PACKARD CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. ONCOLOGY AND HEMATOLOGY. NICHOLAS WAS DIAGNOSED SOON AFTER WITH BETA THALASSEMIA INTERMEDIA A BLOOD DISORDER THAT IMPAIRS THE ABILITY. OF THE BODY TO DELIVER OXYGEN'S SELLS TO ITS TISSUES. BUT WE WERE TOLD THAT SOMETHING ELSE WASN'T RIGHT. WE WERE ASKED TO TAKE HIM BACK TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A LIVER BIOPSY. AND ANOTHER BLOOD DRAW DUE TO HIS HIGH ENZYMES. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH JOE BEAR SYNDROME. BOB IS CAME BACK IN THREE DAYS. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE FIRST IT REVEALED THAT HE HAD SOME SORT OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY. SO NOT CLEAR WHICH KIND HE'D BEEN REFERRED TO THE MDA CLINIC. FOR FURTHER TESTING WHICH INTEL GENETIC SEQUENCING. AT THAT TIME TO CLOSE WAS THREE AND A HALF YEARS OLD TO THE DATE. HE WAS FEELING BETTER BACK TO DAY CARE. AND I FOUND MYSELF GROCERY SHOPPING AND SAFE WAY. AND MY PHONE RANG. IT WAS THE NEUROLOGISTS TELLING ME MRS ARCHDEACON. YOUR SON HAS CHEN SKEWER DYSTROPHY. HE WILL START TO LOSE THE ABILITY TO WALK. HIS RESPIRATORY HOPE WILL FADE AND EVENTUALLY. HIS HEART WE'RE GOING TO FILL YOUR THERE IS NO CURE THERE'S NO THERAPY. AND ALL I CAN DO IS REFER YOU TO CCS. WITH THE HOPES TO BEGIN PHYSICAL THERAPY. JUST GO HOME AND ENJOY THE TIME YOU HAVE WITH THEM. THE AVERAGE LIFESPAN IS INTO THE LATE TEENS. CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GROCERY STORE IN GETTING THAT CALL. I IMMEDIATELY FELT A LOSS FOR MY CHILD. AND THEN INGER. SO LONG BECAUSE I WAS DISMISSED AS BEING A FIRST TIME MOM. I WENT HOME TOGETHER MY THOUGHTS AND SORT OUT THE BEST YOU XIN NEUROLOGISTS WHO IS LOCATED UP ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN CINCINNATI. WE WERE GIVEN A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND HELP. BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS THE OPTION TO TRAVEL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES FOR CARE. MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S STILL SLOW PROCESS. MANY SERVICES ARE DENIED BECAUSE OF LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. OF HIS COMPLEX MEDICAL NEEDS. NICHOLAS HAS A MULTIPLE SPECIALIST. WHO WERE NOT EASY TO FIND DUE TO LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDS OF RARE DISEASE? AND DUE TO HIS NEVER ENDING PROCESS. IN THE NEVER ENDING PERSISTENCE AND CARE NICHOLAS IS DOING MUCH BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE CHILD WITH TO SHINE. WE WERE ACTUALLY TOLD BY THE TIME HE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD HE WOULD BE ENOUGH POWER CHAIR FULL TIME. HE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO RUN JUMPERS GET. WITH EARLY INTERVENTION AND CONTINUE THERAPY NECKLACES TWELVE YEARS OLD TODAY AND CAN STILL WALK. HE CAN RUN HE CAN SKIP HE CAN JUMP. AND WE WERE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS AS WE ARE WHERE WHAT TO LOOK FOR WHEN HE'S. FIFTEEN NEEDING CONSTANT BREAKS. WHAT THIS HE HAS LAST MEDICAL VISITS LESS NEED FOR IN HELD MEDICATIONS AND A STABLE WITH HIS WITH JUST A FEW MEDICATIONS? I OFTEN THINK ABOUT WHAT IF I WASN'T SO PERSISTENT. WHAT IF I HAD WAITED AND WHAT IF I LISTEN TO THESE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS? WOULD HE BE ALIVE TODAY. WOULD HE BE WALKING. MOST LIKELY NOT. HAVING A CHILD WITH MULTIPLE RARE DISEASES IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT WHEN THOSE WHO ARE MAKING THE DECISIONS. DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE MEDICAL COMPLEXITY OF LIVING WITH A RARE DISEASE. WE'VE BEEN TOLD MANY TIMES OVER AND OVER THAT IF THEY CAN'T SEE IMPROVEMENT HE WILL NO LONGER BE. WILL NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR THERAPY. HIS DISEASES ARE PROGRESSIVE THEY'RE NOT CURABLE BUT HE DESERVES A QUALITY LIFE LIKE EVERY OTHER PERSON. I'VE OFTEN WISHED THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER VOICE FOR MY SON. AND OTHERS WHEN MAKING DECISIONS ON SERVICES AND PROVIDED CARE. AND I TRULY HOPE THAT WE CAN SEE A DAY VERY SOON WHEN WE WILL HAVE A VOICE OF UNDERSTANDING THAT CHILDREN LIKE MINE ARE COOKIE CUTTER. MY HOPES ARE THAT WE CAN HAVE A RARE DISEASE.

THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB. TWELVE FORTY NINE AND I WANT TO BEGIN -- AS MY WITNESSES ARE COMING FORWARD BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IN MOSCOW FORM I WANT TO THANK THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE CHAIR FOR THEIR WORK -- I ALSO WANT TO TAKE THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS TO FIVE WORKED ON THIS BILL AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THEIR INPUT THAT YOU SEE THE MOCK UP BEFORE YOU TODAY. WHICH PROVIDES A FOUNDATION FOR PROGRAMS TO BUILD UPON IN THE FUTURE. AB TWELVE FORTY NINE REPRESENTS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO CONTAIN SKYROCKETING HEALTHCARE COSTS EMPLOYERS THAT PROVIDE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES STRUGGLE TO CONTAIN COSTS AND OBTAIN THE BEST QUALITY OF CARE. THERE IS A GROWING MOVEMENT ACROSS THE NATION A PAIR AND PLAYER HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS WITH ORGANIZED INTEGRATED PROVIDERS. IN A MORE ALIGNED RELATIONSHIP TO PRODUCE BETTER CARE AT LOWER COST THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE TWO PILOTS ONE IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE STATE AND THE OTHER IN THE NORTHERN SECTION. THAT WOULD OPERATE FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS THE PILOTS WOULD INCLUDE RISK BEARING PROVIDERS THAT ARE MONITORED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. FOR FINANCIAL SOLVENCY IN OPERATIONS. SELF FUNDED EMPLOYER PLANS WOULD USE REST BASED PAYMENT MECHANISMS WITH THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR THEIR SERVICES RATHER THAN PURE FEE FOR SERVICE COMPENSATION. AT THE END OF THE PERIOD THE PARTICIPANTS WOULD REPORT ON THE OUTCOMES CAN FORM THE LEGISLATURE -- ON PROMISING MODELS OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND DELIVERY A STUDY BY THE UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PREDICTED THAT THIS TYPE OF MODEL. COULD REDUCE HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES BY AN ESTIMATED A HUNDRED AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS IT ALSO PROVIDES PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS LAYING OUT A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION COMPONENTS SUCH AS ACCESS TO SPECIALISTS. PRESCRIPTION BENEFITS IN A COMPLAINTS PROCESS THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE CONTRACTING PARK PROCESS FOR THE PILOT PROGRAMS. BIRDS COMBATING THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE REQUIRES A NEW WAY OF THINKING AND THIS PILOT PROJECT. AUTHORIZED BY THIS BILL CAN CHANGE THE WAY WE APPROACH HEALTH CARE DELIVERY I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. BECAUSE HE OF THREE WITNESSES SO YES THE MINUTES EACH OR YOU HAVE SIX MINUTES TOTAL SO. SEARCH REMEMBER SCOTT WHICH I'D LIKE TO DEFER FIRST TO GEORGE MCGREGOR REPRESENTING. MY CLIENT VIVA VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ASSOCIATION WHICH IS MADE UP OF CTA CSEA A. F. T.. AND SIXTY FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS FEVER IS LIKE YOUR SISTER'S KIDS IT'S A LITTLE THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE DIFFERENT. A I REPRESENT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TEACHERS CUSTODIANS BUS DRIVERS. CONSUMERS OF HEALTH CARE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING THEM HIGHER VALUE AT LOWER COST. A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH EVERYDAY LIFE IN THIS AREA AND THEY NEED AS MUCH HELP AS THEY CAN GET. DEALING IN THE AREA OF HEALTH CARE WHICH IS ONE OF MY CLIENT. SPECIALIZES IN DOING. HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO BARGAINING UNITS SIXTY FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WE HAVE -- FORM SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO WE HAVE OVER THIRTY MILLION MEMBER MONTHS OF MEDICAL COVERAGE -- UNDER OUR BELT THE BOARD BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUT OF ALL OF THAT THERE IS A BEEN ONE PHYSICIAN BANKRUPTCY THERE ISN'T AN ONE MEMBER. BUILD FOR CLAIMS WE INTERVENE ON BEHALF OF THE MEMBERS AND WE HAVE AN IDEA FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF PLAN DESIGN WHICH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THE COST OF HEALTHCARE. BY IMPROVING THE QUALITY LEADING HIGH PERFORMING PHYSICIANS ACTORS PHYSICIANS AND GETTING A LOT OF MIDDLE MAN OUT OF THE WAY. ON TO THAT CONCLUSION WE HAVE A HISTORY OF OUR TEST PILOT PROJECTS PAYING OFF. OUR LAST ONE WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERFORMANCE NETWORK. USING THE OFFICE OF PATIENT ADVOCATE DATA. THAT MEASURES THE QUALITY OF PHYSICIANS GROUP WE INCENTIVIZE FOR MEMBERS TO GO TO HIGH PERFORMING GROUPS. GROUPS ABOVE 90% COMPLIANCE WITH APPROVED MEDICAL PROTOCOL. THE FIRST YOU SAVINGS FOR THIS POPULATION WAS FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OR 11% OF PREMIUM. THERE ARE CURRENT PROVISIONS OF THE KNOX KEEN ACT WHICH PROHIBIT US. FROM MOVING FORWARD WITH THE NEXT GENERATION AND THE BILL WERE ASKING YOUR SUPPORT ON WOULD GIVE US THE ABILITY IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS GOT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL OF SHEET METAL WORKERS. AND THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL TODAY PROBABLY CO SPONSORING THIS BILL WITH A VIVA. FOR FOR THOSE OF YOU ARE AWARE. OUR TRUST FUNDS TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO OUR MEMBERS. DO SO IN ONE OF TWO WAYS. EITHER PURCHASE PRODUCTS OFF THE SHELF FROM AGE YOU MOST. OR SINCE. NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WE DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH PROVIDER GROUPS IN HOSPITALS. BUILDER -- NETWORKS. BEEN DOING IT FOR FORTY SIX YEARS. SUCCESSFULLY BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN ONLY DO THAT ON A FEE FOR SERVICE BASIS. PROVIDER GROUPS LIKE THE ONES REPRESENTED BY MISTER BARCELONA. ARE PROHIBITED FROM DIRECTLY CONTRACTING WITH US ON A CAPITATED BASIS. THIS BILL WOULD GIVE US GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE GREATER SAVINGS TO BE ABLE TO DESIGN OUR OWN BENEFIT DESIGNS. TO UTILIZE TO TAKE OUR OWN UTILIZATION DATA AND MANAGE TO BRING THE BEST COST OUTCOMES. THERE'S BEEN TWO OBJECTIONS TO THIS BILL THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY HEALTH ACCESS AN ORGANIZATION ALL OF MY UNION STRONGLY SUPPORT. FEW OF THEM SUPPORTING THIS BILL EVEN SIT ON THE BOARD. ONE IS THAT THE BILL DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH IN REGARDS TO CONSUMER PROTECTIONS [inaudible] MEMBERS. THESE HEALTH CARE TRUSTS ARE MANAGED BY THE UNION LEADERSHIP OF THE LOCAL UNIONS FROM YOUR DISTRICTS. TO SUGGEST THAT THEY DON'T LOOK AFTER THE BEST INTERESTS OF THEIR MEMBERS AND DO THE VERY BEST THAT THEY CAN TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED IN EVERY WAY. JUST SIMPLY ISN'T THE CASE I THINK YOU KNOW THAT. SECONDLY THERE'S BEEN AN OBJECTION SAYING THAT THE BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATELY IN THE EVENT THAT YOU HAVE A PROVIDER GROUP LIKE A HOSPITAL. GO INSOLVENT. UNDER FEDERAL LAW. NGUYEN A SELF INSURED TAFT HARTLEY TRUST FUND. GOES OUT AND DIRECTLY CONTRACTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW WE MUST INDEMNIFY ALL OF THOSE PROVIDERS. THAT ARGUMENT IS THE REST OF HARRY'S. IT DOES NOT EXIST. WE HAVE TO INDEMNIFY THE PROVIDERS. PLEASE VOTE YES IN THIS VERY INNOVATIVE PILOT PROGRAM. KITTY CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HELD OUR SALONA FOR AMERICA'S POSITION GROUPS ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THE BILL AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THERE'S A SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SERRA FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND WE JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND WITH THE AMENDMENTS WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

HELL FOR HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA. WE APPRECIATE MISTER WHICH IS KIND WORDS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK ORGANIZATION DOES. WE WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT FROM THE BEGINNING OUR POSITION HAS BEEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE WERE NOT OPPOSED TO DIRECT CONTRACTING WE HOWEVER WANTED TO ASSURE. THAT THE PHYSICIAN GROUPS THAT WERE ALSO PARTY TO THIS PILOT PROJECT WOULD CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE KNOX KEEN ACT. THOSE HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. AS WE UNDERSTAND THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU THAT IS WHAT THE AMENDMENTS WOULD ACCOMPLISH. WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE VERSION THAT COMES BACK FROM COUNSEL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS CLEAR. THAT THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS MANY OF WHICH WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR AND MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE SUPPORTED OVER THE YEARS WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN PLACE. OUR BEEF IS IF WE HAVE ONE IS NOT WITH THE V. BOOK OR THE TRUST FUNDS. IT'S WITH A PHYSICIAN GROUPS WHO HAVE OFTEN FAILED TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THEY SHOULD HAVE. AND SO WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS AS THE BILL MOVES FOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBER -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS EXCUSE ME NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS -- WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION ON THE VERSION OF THE BILL THAT IS IN PRINT -- THE REASON THAT WE OPPOSE -- THE BILL IN PRINT IS BECAUSE IT DOES EXEMPT ENTITIES OPERATING IN TWO PILOT COUNTIES FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE KNOX KEEN ACT. WHICH WE VIEW -- AS YOU KNOW PUTTING ARE FULLY LICENSED MEMBER HEALTH PLANS AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE -- VIS A VIS OF THOSE OTHER ENTITIES NOW THERE ARE AS THE PREVIOUS WITNESS STATED AND THE AUTHORS ACCEPTING EXTENSIVE AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE OUTLINED I'M IN THE ANALYSIS -- WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LANGUAGE YET SO WE'D LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO DO THAT -- WE MAY MAINTAIN OUR OPPOSE POSITION OR WE MADE CHANGES BASED ON A REVIEW OF THAT LANGUAGE.

I KNOW I EXACTLY I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MENTAL HEALTH IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF HEALTH CARE THAT IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED ESPECIALLY CHILDREN AND MOMS WERE WE CAN MITIGATE -- MORE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS THE BILL -- THANK YOU ASKED ME MEMBERS AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SIX IN LIGHT OF THAT ARE CUT THIS SHORT WOULD ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS IN INCREASING PREVALENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND MOMS AND CHILDREN -- AND WITH ME I HAVE KELLY CAVE MATERNAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH NOW AND MELANIE THOMAS OF PSYCHIATRISTS WITH UCSF WILL GIVE A BRIEF TESTIMONY AND BE ABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M KELLY O'CONNOR QUE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH NOW. MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AFFECT NEARLY HALF A MILLION CHILDREN THE HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW MOTHERS IN CALIFORNIA EACHYEAR. AS YOU KNOW SUICIDE RATES ARE REACHING EPIDEMIC LEVELS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. OUR CHILDREN AND MOTHERS ARE NOT IMMUNE. PART OF THE PROBLEM IS A SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN PARTICULAR PSYCHIATRISTS. THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION REPORTS OF THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF PSYCHIATRIC SHORTAGE AREAS IN THE NATION. AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SIX SIX ADDRESS OF PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF FRONT LINE PROVIDERS INCLUDING PEDIATRICIANS AND OBSTETRICIANS. TO ASSESS AND TREAT THE MOST COMMON MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS. AS HIGHLIGHTED IN A LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM THE CENTER FOR YOUTH WELLNESS FOUNDED BY SURGEON GENERAL DOCTOR IN THE NINETEEN BURKE HARRIS. CALIFORNIA'S LEADING THE NATION BY FOCUSING ON CHILD AND FAMILY MENTAL HEALTH. AS WE BEGIN SCREENING ALL CHILDREN FOR TRAUMA. AND SCREENING -- MOTHERS FROM INTERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO NEED ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WILL MOST DEFINITELY INCREASE. WHEN EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IS NOT AVAILABLE OR SENSIBLE TO MOTHERS AND CHILDREN'S? FALCONS CAN BE DEVASTATING. FOR EXAMPLE MARKET A SAND OF ALL OF ONTARIO CALIFORNIA EXHIBIT SIGNS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DURING HER SECOND PREGNANCY. DESPITE REPEATEDLY ASKING HER DOCTOR FOR HELP. SHE NEVER RECEIVE SERVICES. AFTER DELIVERY HER SISTER HER SYMPTOMS WORSEN. WHEN SHE FINALLY RECEIVED A REFERRAL TO A PSYCHIATRIST AT TWO MONTHS POSTPARTUM? SHOULD WE THREE WEEKS FOR HER APPOINTMENT. DURING THOSE THREE WEEKS FOR SYMPTOMS INTENSIFIED THE POINT WHERE SHE HAD THOUGHTS OF HARMING HERSELF. AND OTHERS. IF MARKETS OBSTETRICIAN HAD BEEN ABLE TO CONSULT WITH THE PSYCHIATRIST DURING HER PREGNANCY. SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN EMPOWERED TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT MARQUITA FOR MATERNAL DEPRESSION AVOIDING OVER HERE SIGNIFICANT SUFFERING FOR HER FOR HER AND HER FAMILY. CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES ARE COUNTING ON YOU TO PASS AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR MELANIE THOMAS AND A PRACTICING PSYCHIATRIST AND A FACULTY MEMBER AT UCSF. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE PROBLEMATIC SHORTAGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS IN CALIFORNIA MUST INVOLVE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS. THIS BILL AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SIX IS MODELED AFTER THE TELEPHONE PROVIDER TO PROVIDER CONSULTATION PROGRAM. IN MASSACHUSETTS REFERRED TO AS THE MASSES HEAT MASSACHUSETTS CHILD PSYCHIATRY ACCESS PROGRAM CALLED MAKE PAPPA MAKE PAP FOR MOMS. THE MID CAP PROGRAMS HAVE PROVEN OUTCOMES WHICH ARE PUBLISHED IN THE ABSTRACT TRICKS IN GYNECOLOGY JOURNAL JUST LAST YEAR. THE JOURNAL NOTES THAT A PROVIDER TO PROVIDER TRIAGE AND PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION MODEL IS A QUOTE FEASIBLE ACCEPTABLE AND SUSTAINABLE APPROACH TO INCREASING ACCESS TO EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN. FRONT LIGHTER FRONTLINE PROVIDER TRADE ORGANIZATIONS ALSO RECOGNIZE THE ROLE IN EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT. AND THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS GUIDELINES NOTE THE PEDIATRICIAN SHOULD LEARN WHAT PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION IS AVAILABLE TO THEM IN THEIR STATE. EARLY TREATMENT BY THESE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IS CRITICAL TO MITIGATE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS. INCLUDING CHRONIC DEBILITATING DISEASE AND SOMETIMES SUICIDE. FURTHERMORE MANY OF OUR MOMS AND CHILDREN IT WOULD ACTUALLY PREFERRED TO CONFRONT AND ADDRESS THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS WITHIN THEIR ESTABLISHED PRIMARY MEDICAL HOME. IN MY PRACTICE I HAVE WEEKLY IF NOT DAILY EVIDENCE FOR THE IMPACT THAT IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO A PSYCHIATRIST CAN MAKE FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN THE PATIENTS THEY SERVE. JUST YESTERDAY AN OBGYN CALLING CONTACTED ME ABOUT AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD PATIENT. WHO HAD JUST DISCOVERED THAT SHE'S PREGNANT ALREADY IN HER THIRD TRIMESTER AND WAS QUITE DEPRESSED? I WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE REAL TIME CONSULTATION RESULTING IN THE OBSTETRICIAN FEELING EMPOWERED TO FURTHER ASSESS AND THEN OFFER MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR THIS YOUNG MOM. UNFORTUNATELY THESE SITUATIONS ARE ALL TOO COMMON AND OUR CURRENT APPROACH IS FAILING THE% MOTHERS AND CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS A SUPPORT PLEASE. CUSTOMER CALLING WITH TWENTY TWENTY MOM AND NAPA MOMS AND SUPPORT. LISA CUT OFF WITH YOUR STATE TO A PROGRAM IN SUPPORT.

WHO DESPERATELY NEED THESE SERVICES AS PART OF MY JOB AT UCSF A MATERNAL FETAL MEDICINE SPECIALIST? I TRAVELED TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REAL COUNTIES WERE OFTEN PREGNANT WOMEN OR TAKEN OFF THE MEDICATIONS BECAUSE THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ARE STILL SCARED TO CONTINUE IT. AND THEN THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO FIND PSYCHIATRY HELP POST PARTUM WE DESPERATELY NEED THIS VIDEO HEALTH. IS IN TUNE WITH THE NEXT GENERATION.

GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER ALLEY WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS -- AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL -- YOU KNOW CAPS MEMBER COMPANIES CURRENTLY PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND MEDICATIONS -- AND THAT INCLUDES MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH -- IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. A NEW REQUIREMENT WENT INTO EFFECT REQUIRING HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO HAVE A PROGRAM IN PLACE. FOR A WOMAN TO DEAL WITH MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH WHEN ONE CALLS THEIR THEIR PLAN WITH AN ISSUE IN THOSE PROGRAMS ARE UP AND RUNNING NOW -- ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFIT REVIEW BOARD CHIPPER. 75% HEALTH PLANS CURRENTLY HAVE AN EASY CONSUL PROGRAM AVAILABLE FOR PHYSICIANS TO ACCESS THAT THEY NEED. TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ECON SOUL PROP PROGRAM THAT MY MEMBERS CURRENTLY UTILIZE AND THIS BILLS THAT REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO HAVE SOMEBODY. OUR READERS AND HOUSE TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE AND SO WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE USE OF OF RESOURCES IN THE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES IN THE STATE. TO HAVE PSYCHIATRISTS AVAILABLE -- TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FOR PHYSICIANS TO CALL -- WITH QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT DIFFERS FROM PLANTS ARE CURRENT PROGRAMS IMPLANTS OR THAT PLANTS CURRENTLY HAVE IN PLACE -- AND SO FOR THIS REASON WE JUST WE JUST DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. SEVENTY ONE CAN SOME WE HAVE A THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE TO OUR OPPOSE WE APPRECIATE LAST YEAR WE WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS TO COME UP WITH WHAT WE FELT LIKE WAS A GOOD PLAN OF ACTION. FOR THE PLANS TO COME UP WITH INTERNAL PROCESSES THAT THEY WOULD PROVIDE -- TO PROVIDERS SO THAT WE COULD MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAD APPROPRIATE ACCESS WITH BEST PRACTICES IN PLACE. WE THINK THAT THIS IS A LITTLE PREMATURE WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS THE MEMBERS ARE JUST IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING THOSE IN PLACE WE'D LIKE TO SEE. WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES ARE AND MAYBE BEGIN A CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD ABOUT? WHAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WHAT THEY'VE SEEN WHAT THE OUTCOMES THAT THEY'VE SEEN PROVIDING PROVIDERS WITH MORE INFORMATION AND ACCESS SO FOR THOSE REASONS TODAY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL? FOR MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WOULD SHARE THE CONCERNS OF CAP NECKLACE AND LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS.

YOUR FIVE LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU MISTER THANKS VERY MUCH. NEXT MISTER O'DONNELL. ELEVEN TWENTY SIX THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB. ELEVEN TWENTY SIX WHICH WILL FACILITATE THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH BY ENSURING THAT AVAILABLE MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS ARE USED EFFECTIVELY. WE KNOW THAT YOUTH WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL TO ENGAGE IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OTHER RISK TAKING BEHAVIORS. SCHOOLS RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR STUDENTS BUT GENERALLY LACK ACCESS TO THE NECESSARY FUNDING TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES COMMISSION OVERSEES THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT OR MH ACE MH ACE M. H. S. A. WHICH FUNDS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THROUGH A 1% TAX. ON PERSONAL INCOMES ABOVE ONE MILLION DOLLARS. A PORTION OF THE MH AS A FUNDS ARE TO BE USED FOR PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. AND MANY CASES SCHOOLS ARE UNAWARE OF THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THESE FUNDS OR HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACCESS THEM TO MEET THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. OF THEIR STUDENTS THIS BILL WILL ESTABLISH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS. TO SUPPORT COUNTIES IN ADDRESSING KEY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH. THIS BILL ALL THOSE ALSO REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO DEVELOP TOOLS TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY A MENTAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES ACROSS OUR STATE. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THE FUNDING AVAILABLE. TO MEET LOCAL NEEDS FINALLY AB ELEVEN TWENTY SIX WILL ESTABLISH AN INNOVATION INCUBATOR. TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO INNOVATIVE COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS DOCTOR. TOBY EWING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MENTAL HEALTH OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. THANKS VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- TO BE DOING ON BEHALF OF THE STATE'S NO HEALTH COMMISSION -- THIS IS A A BILL THAT REALLY PUTS IN PLACE THREE STRATEGIES THAT WE THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE THAT WE NEED OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. FIRST IT REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO PUT IN PLACE A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY -- STRATEGY WE'VE BEGUN THAT WORK BUT IT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE IS VERY LIMITED TO THE M. HSA PORTION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CERTAIN MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT'S ABOUT 25% OF OUR SYSTEM WE KNOW VERY LITTLE. ABOUT THE OTHER THREE QUARTERS OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. BUT IN ADDITION TO HAVING US -- IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO INFORM YOU AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IT ALSO EMPOWERS THE COMMISSION. TO PUT IN PLACE STRATEGIES TO DRIVE IMPROVEMENT. BY FIRST SUPPORTING OUR ABILITY TO FACILITATE INNOVATION ACROSS COUNTY SOMETHING THAT WE STARTED BUT THAT WE HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO DO IN THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND UPON THAT. AND AND IN MANY WAYS MORE IMPORTANTLY -- IT WOULD PUT IN PLACE STRATEGIES FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE COUNTIES WE SPENT TIME LAST YEAR TALKING WITH CITY COUNTY AND COMMUNITY LEADERS ABOUT THE GREATEST CHALLENGES FACING OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND WHAT MANY OF THOSE OFFICIALS SAID IS THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO PUT IN PLACE A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE STRATEGY THAT CAN HELP THEM BUILD UPON SUCCESSES IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE AND EXTENT OF SUCCESSES TO OTHER AREAS. SO WE REALLY LIKE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT COMBINES THE COMMISSION'S ABILITY TO REALLY OUTLINED WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING. BUT ALSO TO PUT IN PLACE THE STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. VERY MUCH OTHER SUPPORT TONY TO CARE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OLGA SHILOH LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

RAMOS ROSS I RODRIGUEZ SANTIAGO [inaudible] WALDRON. IF YOU HAVE FOUR VOTES WITH A LOT OF MEMBERS THAT ARE OUT AND ABOUT SO WILL BE THE BILL ON CALL. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] MR. TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- I WILL FIRST PRESENT AB FIFTEEN TWENTY FOUR PER SHARE CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL TO EXPEDITE MEDI CAL APPROVAL FOR STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS. THESE ARE HEALTH CENTERS THAT ARE GENERALLY LOCATED ON A CAMPUS THAT PROVIDE PREVENTIVE AND PRIMARY CARE SERVICES -- HOWEVER DESPITE THE LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WERE ELIGIBLE OR CURRENTLY COVERED BY MEDICARE. ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THESE HEALTH CENTERS ARE AND ROLLED MEDI CAL PROVIDERS THIS PROVIDES THIS POSES A BARRIER TO STUDENTS WHO HAVE TO GO OFF CAMPUS TO FIND A MEDICAL PROVIDER. IN ADDITION STERN HEALTH CENTERS ARE PERMITTED TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WITH ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING AND TIME SENSITIVE PREGNANCY SERVICES. BUT TO BECOME A PROVIDER OF THOSE SERVICES THE CENTERS MUST FIRST AND ROLE IN MEDICAL. CURRENT LONGER THIS BILL. THANK YOU -- I'LL BE VERY BRIEF CURRENT LAW ESTABLISHES A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME BUT OFTENTIMES THAT PROCESS TAKES NINE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES PARTICULARLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES CALIFORNIA CREATED A FAST TRACK ENROLLMENT PROCESS FOR QUALIFIED PRIMARY CARE CLINICS. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY PUT STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS ON PAR WITH SIMILARLY SITUATED AFFILIATE PRIMARY CARE CLINICS REQUIRED APPLICATIONS TO BE PROVED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. WITH THAT I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAUREN CAM HANNAH I'M THE NURSE PRACTITIONER COORDINATOR OF STUDENT HEALTH SERVICES AT COLUMBIA COLLEGE.

MEDIC CALIBAN WE PACKED OUR CRITICAL FUNDING STREAMS FOR OUR PROGRAMS WHICH STRUGGLE WITH AN UNSTABLE FUNDING MODEL. AS A SUPPORT PROGRAM THAT DOES NOT RECEIVE STATE OR FEDERAL BASELINE CATEGORICAL FUNDING MAINTAINING BEST PRACTICE MODELS IS CHALLENGING WITH FLUCTUATING STUDENT HEALTH FEES WHICH ARE NOW TWENTY ONE DOLLARS PER SEMESTER PER STUDENT. DUE TO VARYING ROLAND NUMBERS THOSE FEES VARY WE HAVE I'M GUARANTEED GRANTS I'M GUARANTEED GENERAL FUND OR EQUITY FUND CONTRIBUTIONS SHORTENING THE APPLICATION PROCESS FROM UPWARDS OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THE COMPLICATIONS THAT TIME FRAME PRESENTS TO ABOUT THIRTY DAYS. WELL INCENTIVIZE MORE CENTERS TO PARTICIPATE AND RECEIVE VITAL FUNDING TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL PRIMARY CARE AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES ON THEIR CAMPUSES ESPECIALLY PREGNANCY RELATED AND FAMILY PLANNING. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. POTENTIALLY REPRESENTING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS DO NOT HAVE A HEALTH CENTER PROGRAM.

SOMEWHERE IN THE BUILDING. AND I'M SURE THEY'LL COME BACK AT SOME POINT SO. YOUR NEXT BILL SIR GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB SIXTEEN ELEVEN TO END SURPRISE BILLING AND EMERGENCY ROOMS ON THE FIRST START BY THANKING THE CHAIR IN YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR DILIGENT WORK WITH OUR OFFICE ON AMENDMENTS. WHICH I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT TODAY. RECENTLY POLICY MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC LEARNED ABOUT MANY MANY STORIES OF PATIENTS AND EMERGENCY ROOMS IN MY CITY AND OTHERS WHO'VE BEEN CHARGED WITH EXORBITANT BILLS DESPITE HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE. ONE IS IF YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE YOU'D THINK THAT IF YOU NEED EMERGENCY ROOM CARE YOU BE COVERED. TURNS OUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN TRUE IN. MANY OF OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE BROUGHT TO THE WRONG HOSPITAL YOU COULD BE SURPRISED BY EXORBITANT SURPRISE BILLS BILLING. THE BILL BEING SENT TO YOU FOR THE BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT A HOSPITAL WANTS TO PAY WHAT INSURANCE HAS PAID. IF YOU'RE INCAPACITATED OR UNDERGOING A LIFE THREATENING CONDITION YOU DON'T HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO DECIDE WHAT HOSPITAL TO GO. TO WHEN YOU'RE IN THE AMBULANCE YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE OF REAR TRANSPORTED. TO BUT UNTIL THE STORY SURFACED WE THOUGHT THE PRACTICE ABOUNDS BILLING HAD BEEN ADDRESSED BY A DECADE OLD CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASE. AND A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA LAW THAT WE PASSED AB. SEVENTY TWO TURNS OUT THERE ARE STILL MAJOR HOLES IN THE LAW POTENTIALLY IMPACTING MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE. SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE INSURANCE UNDER FEDERALLY REGULATED SELF INSURED PLANTS. UP TO A MILLION WHO HAVE PLANS THAT ARE REGULATED BY CDI. OUR BILL WOULD PROTECT PATIENTS IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES FROM SURPRISE BOUNCE BILLING RELATED TO EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. INSURED PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR INSURANCE WOULD ONLY -- WITH THEIR CO PAYMENT OR DEDUCTIBLE WHEN RECEIVING EMERGENCY CARE EVEN IF THE HOSPITAL IS OUT OF NETWORK. HOSPITALS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SEND THE PATIENT AN EXORBITANT BILL AND WAR SEND THEM TO COLLECTIONS FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THE CO PAYMENT OR DEDUCTIBLE. TO RECOUP OTHER CASA HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE TO WORK IT OUT WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY OUR BILL ALSO PROPOSES STANDARDIZING THOSE NEGOTIATIONS SO THAT THERE IS SOME PREDICTABILITY. AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THIS COMMITTEE WERE MEANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO PROVIDERS AS THAT ISSUE WAS HANDLED IN PREVIOUS LEGISLATION. I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE STILL SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME TECHNICAL DRAFTING ISSUES AND I AM COMMITTED TO REMOVING DOCTORS OUT OF THIS BILL. ADDITIONALLY A MINUTES TAKEN IN THIS COMMITTEE WILL REMOVE THE MEDICARE RIGHT FROM THE BILL WHICH MEANS THE INITIAL PAYMENT TO ANY HOSPITAL WILL BE THE AVERAGE CONTRACTED RATES FOR THAT REGION. AFTER A MEDICAL EMERGENCY THE ONLY THING A PATIENT SHOULD WORRY ABOUT IS HOW TO GET BETTER NOT WHETHER HOSPITAL BILL COULD LEAD TO FINANCIAL RUIN. WITH THAT APPRECIATE OUR WITNESSES WERE HERE SIR FLOCKS FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND BETH CAPELL WITH HEALTH ACCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE. BEST HELL ON BEHALF OF HEALTH TEXAS CALIFORNIA PLEASED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT MY MORE NORMAL ROLE OF THIS MEASURE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM BALANCE BILLING WHEN THEY GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. THAT MAY BE OUT OF NETWORK. AS OUR AUTHOR MISS CHIU SAID WE HAD THOUGHT THAT THE PROSPECT DECISION PROTECTED MOST CONSUMERS BUT WE HAVE DISCOVERED OVER THE YEARS THAT EVEN CONSUMERS WHO CANNOT BE BALANCE BUILD CAN IN FACT BE BILLED. AND TAKEN TO COLLECTIONS EVEN IF THEY'RE AMONG THE TEN OR TWELVE MILLION OF US WHO HAVE COVERAGE REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. IN ADDITION AS YOU MENTIONED THERE SEVEN MILLION OTHER CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE COVERAGE REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE OR THERE ARE FEDERAL FEDERALLY REGULATED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. WHO DO NOT HAVE PROTECTION ON FROM BALANCE BILLING INDEED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT EXPRESSLY REQUIRES COVERAGE FOR EMERGENCY CARE AND THEN? EXPLICITLY ALLOWS BALANCE BILLING FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES AND LAST THERE IS A STATE LAW IN PLACE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. THIS IS THAT BUILT TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND WE WANT TO PROTECT CONSUMERS NOT ONLY. WHEN THEY GET THAT INITIAL BILL AND MAKE SURE THEY ONLY -- THEIR CO PAY AND DEDUCTIBLES EXACTLY THE SAME LANGUAGE WE HADN'T AB. SEVENTY TWO BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE REQUIREMENT THAT EMERGENCY CARE BE COVERED IS NOT USED TO DRIVE UP PREMIUMS IN AN UNTOWARD WAY. HENCE THE USE OF THE AVERAGE CONTRA ACTED RATE FOR THAT SERVICE FOR THAT HEALTH PLAN FOR THAT REGION AS THE INTERIM STANDARD. THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN PRINT ALSO CLARIFIED THAT HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO RETAIN THE AUTHORITY TO ARBITRATOR LITIGATE AS THEY CURRENTLY DO AGAINST HEALTH PLANS. THESE PROTECTIONS GO HAND IN HAND WITHOUT. WITHOUT THE SECOND PART OF IT THE PROTECTION FROM CONSUMERS BEING BALANCED BUILD COULD HAVE OTHER UNTOWARD. IMPACTS ON OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PLEASED TO BE IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THEIR FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL -- AND I WANTED TO BUILD A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT -- HEALTHAXIS WAS SAYING I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE A GROWING CONSENSUS AND YOU'LL HEAR THIS FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND PATIENTS FROM SURPRISE BILLS IN THE ER. I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION CONCERN AROUND THE DEFAULT PAYMENT RATE. AS I SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN EVERY DOLLAR THAT IS SPENT ON HEALTHCARE IS A DOLLAR THAT COMES OUT OF THE POCKET OF A WORKER FROM A PATIENT AT TAXPAYER OR AN EMPLOYER. AND HEALTHCARE IS A LOT LIKE A BALLOON IF YOU SQUEEZE ONE END OF THE BALLOON AND PROTECT PATIENTS FROM SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS IT'S GOING TO BLOW UP THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BALLOON. AND THOSE THAT OTHER SIDE OF THE BALLOON IS OUR PREMIUMS. FROM 200-022-2000. SIXTEEN THE AVERAGE HOSPITAL PRICES PAID INCREASED 2100%. THOSE ARE PRICES THAT ARE DRIVING OUR PREMIUMS WE NEED SOME KIND OF PROTECTION A VERY REASONABLE BALANCE SO THAT WHEN WE'RE PROTECTING PATIENTS WERE PROTECTING THEM IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. BUT WE'RE ALSO PROTECTING THEM WHEN THEY GO TO PAY THEIR MONTHLY PREMIUM. AND SO THIS BILL I THINK THANKS TO THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS HAS REACHED A REASONABLE BALANCE WHERE WE PROTECT PATIENTS WE MAKE SURE HOSPITALS ARE ABLE TO OPERATE AND KEEP TREATING PATIENTS. BUT WE ALSO PROTECT THE EMPLOYERS THE WORKERS THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING THE INCREASING COST OF HEALTHCARE. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER SUPPORT. LINDA TO NARROW ITS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK IN SUPPORT. PERSON I COULD ALSO ON BEHALF OF CITY AND COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO IS PART.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND THE WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA WEST IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MAUREEN MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO ONE OPPOSITION YEAH. EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS IS IT IT IS EVENING. SOON CATHERINE ALSO IT'S GOT RISEN CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION -- WE LIKE OTHERS AT THE TABLE AS THIS SUPPORTERS MENTIONED AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF IN SUPPORT OF OF REMOVING THE PATIENT FROM THE MIDDLE. OF THE BALANCE BILLING -- SITUATION OUT WE WOULD DO BELIEVE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN HOSPITAL THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE BILL THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE THEY SHOULD WORRY ABOUT THE CARE THEY'RE GOING TO GOT. AND THE SIMPLEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO LEAVE THE BILL -- TO JUST REMOVE THAT PREVENT PROVISION -- AND NOT CONTINUE NOT TO INCLUDE THE DEFAULT RATE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DEFAULT RATE FOR HOSPITALS -- AS WE SAW IN PREVIOUS COMMITTEES AB SEVENTY TWO MADE SOME I'D CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM CREATED DEFAULT RATE AND UNFORTUNATELY CRATED -- SOME ISSUES FOR PROVIDERS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OUR FOUR HUNDRED HOSPITALS AND SYSTEM SO WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE DEFAULT RATE COULD HAVE. CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE HOSPITALS AS IT ROLLS FORWARD. WE AS AS WE STE -- SAID THOSE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES COULD CREATE AT A RATE THAT COULD DECREASE OVER TIME I'M IN -- FOR FOR OUR HOSPITALS WERE 38% OF THEM ARE IN THE RED THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOSPITALS WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THAT -- WE DO HAVE A WELL ESTABLISHED SYSTEM. TO MANAGE THE RATE NEGOTIATIONS THAT RELIES ON THE REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY STANDARDS DEVELOPED OVER YEARS OF COURT CASES -- AND THAT IS USED CURRENTLY BETWEEN OUR INSURERS AND OUR HOSPITALS THESE ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED ENTITIES AND WE BELIEVE CONTINUING THAT WILL PROVIDE THE CONTINUITY WHILE STILL GETTING THE PATIENT OUT OF THE MIDDLE. WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT TAKING THE BENCH MARK MEDICARE RATE OUT -- WAS -- HELPFUL BUT THE AVERAGE CONTRACT RATE REMAINING -- UNFORTUNATELY COULD CONTINUE COULD DISCOURAGE HEALTH PLANS -- FROM CONTRACTING ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS I'M AND WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- OUR HOSPITALS NEGOTIATE DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON PATIENT VOLUME BROUGHT BY THE PLAN -- AND WE WILL IN THIS BILL COULD ALLOW THOSE HOSPITALS I'M RIGHT IT COULD DISCONTINUE THAT -- SORRY COULD DISCONTINUE THE INCENTIVE FOR PLANS TO COME TO THE TABLE AND NEGOTIATE THOSE RATES BY DRIVING THAT RATE DOWN -- UNFORTUNATELY SIX ELEVEN ALSO INCLUDES POST STABILIZATION RATES UP TO THE POST ABLE EDUCATION SERVICES THESE OF THE SERVICES AFTER THE PATIENT IS STABILIZED AND THEN OFTEN MOVES INTO THEIR OWN PLAN WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THOSE CONTRACTED. OR NON CONTRACTED RATES COULD DO AS WELL -- AS WELL AS IT DOES INCLUDE A RISA PLANS AS MENTIONED AND WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO ADDRESS THAT SOME BIPARTISAN EFFORT. STRANGELY ENOUGH IN DC -- AND WE ARE WORKING ON THOSE EFFORTS AS WELL THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OF PIECES WELL AS THERE AREN'T PROTECTIONS FOR PROVIDERS AND THEY WERE SO PLANS AND WE CONCERT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR ABILITY. TO FOR PROMPT PAYMENT EXCEPT TRACK I'M THAT WE ENJOY A THROUGH THE RICH DE MHC SYSTEM SO -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE CONTINUE TO BE OPPOSED -- AND LESS THE DEFAULT RATE IS TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL THANK YOU -- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IS HERE TO HELP WITH ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE PALES REPRESENTING. TEN HOSPITALS WE HAVE THIRTEEN HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHERE A MAJOR PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO MEDI CAL POPULATION ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE STATE -- AND WE DO A PLAY A LOT IN THE SELF INSURED SPACE THAT JUST TO BE CLEAR THESE ARE -- STATE EXAM PLANNED SO MUCH OF WHAT. YOU DO HERE AND HEALTH COMMITTEE THEY ARE COMPLETELY EXEMPT FROM -- NOT ALL SELF INSURED PLANS ARE THE SAME SUMMER VERY SOPHISTICATED OPERATORS. IN WORK VERY MUCH OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PLAN THEY JOIN NETWORKS THAT HEALTH PLANS ALREADY HAVE. PAYMENT IN THOSE SITUATIONS CAN BE SEAMLESS IN OTHER SITUATIONS HOWEVER IT'S MUCH DIFFERENT WHERE WE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A PATIENT COM PRESENT. SHOW WAS THE CARD THAT THEY'RE PART OF THIS -- NETWORK THERE WE GO THEN COLLECT FROM THE PAIR AND THE PAY REFUSE TO PAY OUT THAT WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE A PRE. NEGOTIATED RATE SO THIS IS STILL SORT OF A BLACK BOX FOR US IN THERE THEREFORE WE'RE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE RATE WHAT'S LEFT OF THE RATE SETTING PORTION OF THE BILL. LIKE THE PREVIOUS WITNESSES WE ARE VERY WILLING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR THE PATIENT WE WILL AGREED TO GIVE THE PATIENT THE SAME PROTECTIONS THEY HAVE. UNDER KNOCKS KEEN AND WE WILL ACTUALLY TAKE THAT OBLIGATION ON OURSELVES SO THAT WE WILL HAVE TO GO FIND THE PAIR. FIND OUT WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE PAID IF THEY WERE IN NETWORK. BILL THEM JUST FOR THAT AND THEN COLLECTED THE REST OF THE FUND FROM THESE THE EXEMPTS SELF INSURED PAIR -- BUT WE STOP SHORT OF THAT WE DON'T WANT THAT WE WE WHILE WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO GET THE PATIENT THOSE TYPE OF PROTECTIONS. WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE ESSENTIALLY A FREEBIE TO WHAT WOULD BE THE EXAM -- HEALTH AND TO THE HEALTH HEALTH INSURER THAT'S TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE SERVICES SO AGAIN -- WE'RE FINE WITH THE PORTION THAT TAKE THE PATIENT OUT OF THE BILLING DISPUTE AND OFFER THEM THE SAME PROTECTIONS. AS CURRENT LAW BUT WE ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE RATE SETTING PORTION OF THIS BILL GIVEN THIS PAYERS PROFILE AND FOR THOSEREASONS WE STILL REMAIN OPPOSED. THANK YOU. OTHER SET OFF. SHERMAN MEMBERS TOTAL SLOPE OF THE UNITED HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE CO MISS CAUGHT AND OF MR FULL ONTO PURPOSES ARE COMMENTS WE REMAIN OPPOSED THANK YOU. SEAN FLANIGAN ON BEHALF OF THE HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF AMERICA -- ABOUT FOUR HOSPITALS AND JOSE LOS ANGELES AND RIVERSIDE -- WE SHARE THE SAME COMMENTS AS THE OPPONENTS. OF HIS BILL AND OR OPPOSE IN THIS MESSAGE THANK YOU THANK YOU. PERCENT SHORT ON BEHALF OF THE LINES OF CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE AND STANFORD HEALTH CARE IN OPPOSE LESS AMENDED POSITION. VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. SEE KNOWN BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. RESTAURANTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- SPRINGING UP SOME OF THE THE COMMENTS IN THIS YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO BE A A BILL THAT'S MOVING. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- HOWEVER THERE STILL SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF DISCUSSION OVER THE RATE SETTING -- ANDTHE DIFFERENT DEFAULT RATE THAT'S THERE. IS THEIR CONTINUING DIALOGUE -- RATE SETTING WOULD BE AT MAKING SURE THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S RING SOME TYPE OF STABILITY TO THOSE AREAS. QUESTION IS ABSOLUTELY -- ET ME START BY GIVING A LITTLE HISTORY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THIS COMMITTEE IN OUR LEGISLATURE HAD A VERY INTENSE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH. SURPRISE BOUNCE BILLION IN THE NON EMERGENCY CONTACTS AND CAME UP WITH THE STRUCTURE THAT WAS EMBODIED IN AB -- SEVENTY TWO WHICH IS THE MODEL THAT WE ATTEMPTED TO EMULATE FOR THIS BILL -- AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO PROTECT THE PATIENT BUT ALSO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS SOME PREDICTABILITY AS TO WITH REGARDS TO WHAT THE PAYMENTS WOULD BE -- WITH THE CHANGES THAT THE CHAIRMAN HAS ASKED AND AND BY THE WAY I WOULD SAY THAT WHEN WE STRUCTURED IT WE STRUCTURE TO TO GIVE THE HOSPITAL'S MORE THAN WHAT WAS PROVIDED IN AB. SEVENTY TWO WITH THE CHANGES THAT -- DOCTOR WOULD HAS ASKED US TO TAKE THAT WE HAVE AMENDED AND THIS COMMITTEE WE'VE EVEN MOVE FARTHER -- CLOSER TO WHERE I THINK THE HOSPITAL'S WANT TO GO I AM ABSOLUTE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS WILL LIKELY NEED TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION IN PART BECAUSE WE'VE HAD. LITERALLY AS I SAID BEFORE IN MY CITY ALONE THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVE. BILLS AFTER -- AFTER AN ACCIDENT PEOPLE WHO ARE INSURED HE WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHO HAD A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE -- BUT YOU KNOW AND ULTIMATELY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE ARE SEVEN MILLION INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO MAY LIKELY FALL INTO THIS SITUATION AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT FOR THAT BUT THAT THE QUICK ANSWER QUESTION IS YES IT. IS THANK YOU IN A AND I DO SEE THE PROMISE OF IT AS FAR AS THE BILL IN AND AND AND THOSE. COSTS COMING TO THE PATIENTS THEIR WHEN THEY SEE THAT BILL COMING ORWARD IT'S MORE ON THE RATE SETTING ASPECT OF IT THAT I THINK THERE SHOULD BE -- MORE DIALOGUE ON AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THAT -- COMING UP IN THE FUTURE AND GETTING UPDATES ON IT -- YOU KNOW TODAY IS IS IT. IT'S LOOKING LIKE -- I WILL BE SUPPORTED BUT I WANT TO SEE SOME OF THAT DIALOGUE GOING ON A KEEPING ME UPDATE OR MY OFFICE UPDATED. AS FAR AS HOW FAR WE'RE MOVING FORWARD ON THE RACING COMPONENT OF IT THE THE ASPECT IN THE PREMISE AS FAR AS THE PATIENT SEEN. OUR THIS AMOUNT AFTER BEING TREATED IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE'VE ALREADY THAT'S A PART THAT I AGREE -- THE PART THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT IS THE RATE SETTING AND LOOKING AT THAT DEFAULT AND THEIR MEMBERS THAT WERE OFFERED AS FAR AS TAKING TAKING THAT BENCHMARK IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS OUT. THING GOES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT CONTINUING TO LOOK AT THE DIALOGUE MOVING FORWARD. GREAT AND ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION -- WE'VE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT QUOTE IF DISSATISFIED EITHER PARTY MAY PURSUE ANY RIGHT REMEDY OR PENALTY ESTABLISH UNDER ANY OTHER APPLICABLE LAW SO IN OTHER WORDS. WE ENVISION IF THERE ARE ISSUES THAT THESE COULD BE RESOLVED IN A DIFFERENT SETTING BUT OUR HOPE IS AGAIN THIS CREATES A STRUCTURE -- TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES QUICKLY BUT AGAIN POINT WELL TAKEN AND I WILL ABSOLUTELY -- MAKE SURE THAT I KEEP YOU INFORMED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALSO REMEMBER. FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'LL BE VOTING FOR YOUR BILL TODAY -- I'M A STRONG PROPONENT OF STRAW A STRONG SUPPORTER OF PROVISIONS TO PREVENT -- PROHIBIT BALANCE BILLING PROTECT PATIENTS FROM UNEXPECTED BILLS. I DO HAVE CONCERNS OF THE RAPE BILLING -- PIECE OF THE BILL HOWEVER THEN AMENDMENTS ARE NEW AND I REALLY WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH MY LOCALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THOSE BEFORE. I MOVE ONCE ONCE WE GET TO THE FLOOR I WILL HAVE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION AT THAT POINT. I WILL ADD YOU TO THAT LIST THANK YOU. WE CAN WE CAN HEAR YOUR VOICE FOR CLEARLY. I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT ANYTHING I JUST WILL THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO CONSIDER A CONVERSATION ON THE RATE SETTING OUT I'LL JUST A LINE MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN ANYONE ELSE -- JUST JUST COMMENT OR QUESTION YOU KNOW QUESTION HERE AND OBVIOUSLY WE WORK CLOSELY WITH YOU IN THIS BILL IS NOW SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN IN A COUPLE OF AREAS. SO I HEARD FROM MISTER PALES REGARDING TEN HOSPITALS IN THAT THE DESIRE TO TAKE THE PATIENT OUT OF THIS AND SOUNDS LIKE THE HOSPITAL THEN GOES AFTER WHOEVER TO GET PAID. IS THAT THE SAME GONNA BE THE SAME FOR ALL FOUR HUNDRED AND SOMETHING OTHER HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA WAS THAT COULD BE JUST PECULIAR -- TO MISTER TO MISTER THERE. THIS IS [inaudible] LANCE. SO AND SO AND IF WE IF THERE IS NO RATE COMPONENT. HOW AND HOW DO YOU TAKE THE PATIENT OUT TO PROTECT THE PATIENT? HOW DO YOU SO OUR OUR HOSPITALS WOULD GO AFTER THE INSURERS I THINK THAT QUESTION WE HAVE IN -- TENANTS AMENDMENTS IS HOW YOU FIGURE OUT WHO THE INSURER IS IF THE PATIENT ISN'T AVAILABLE TO TELL YOU THAT SO I THINK WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH THAT TECHNICALLY AND I THINK WE'VE. SEEN OTHER BILLS IN THAT SPACE -- BUT WE NOW GO AFTER. YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE IF WE HAVE A PLACE WHERE WE'RE NOT BILLING -- THE PATIENTS WHICH THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE'S EXISTING LAW THEN WE GO TO THE INSURER AND USE THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO WORK THAT I THINK I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHICH PATIENTS WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND THE ARREST SO WE WOULD GO AFTER THE PATIENT PROVIDES US WITH THEIR PLAN INFORMATION WE WOULD GO AFTER THAT BUT IF WE CAN'T BILL THE PATIENT AT ALL. THEN I GUESS I HAVE THE SAME QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU FIND OUT WHO THE INSURED IT SURE IS? OTHER THAN THE PATIENT JUST LETTING YOU NOW. THE SERVICE AND THEN AND IN THIS CAPACITY I THINK THERE'SWAYS TO DO THAT. YEAH SO I THINK GENERALLY THE THE WAY WE ENVISION OPERATE AND BY THE WAY THIS IS THE WAY WE OPERATE CURRENTLY. IS WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT FROM THE PATIENT. WHO THAT -- PAYER AS WE WILL FIND THE PAIR WE WILL FIND THE POLICY WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT RIGHTS THE PATIENT HAS. UNDER THAT POLICY RELATIVE TO EMERGENCY ROOM COVERAGE WE WILL BAND JUST BILL -- THAT PORTION THAT WOULD BE SPECIFIED IN THEIR POLICY IN OTHER WORDS IF THERE POLICY PROVIDES FOR AN IN NETWORK CHARGE NOT TO EXCEED. SEVEN FIFTY DOLLARS THAT'S ALL WE WOULD BILL. AND THEN WHAT WAS WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT TO STILL BE ABLE TO DO. IS GO AFTER THE PAIR FOR EVER AMOUNTS WE BELIEVE ARE CURRENTLY DRIVEN BY THE GUIDELINES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AB SEVENTY TWO IN THE DEFAULT RATE SENT SET THERE. IS THAT MATIN VARMINT YOU TALK ABOUT KNOCKS KEEN REGULATED PLANS. SO THOSE THOSE HALF OR OR PROVIDER SO THERE THERE YOU HAPPEN NETWORK OUT US ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS. FOR A FOR EXAMPLE A RISA PLAN THERE'S NO NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS SO WITHOUT THAT STICK. WE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE DEFAULT RATE IS. IS EFFECTIVE IN ENSURING THAT THERE'S CONTRACT CONTRACTS GOING BOTH WAYS WHICH ULTIMATELY ON THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT. SKIP. MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY. UM SEVERAL POINTS MUD BUT TO WOVEN TOGETHER HERE LET ME SAY IT THAT WAY -- MOST AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW BETTER THAN WE WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT MOST BILLING DONE. IN HEALTH CARE IS DONE ELECTRONICALLY AND IS DONE BY A HANDFUL OF COMPANIES. THERE IT IS POSSIBLE TO KNOW IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE PATIENT WHO THEIR COVERAGE IS THROUGH SO I THINK THAT'S A WORKABLE PROBLEM BUT WE ARE ALWAYS WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND WORK THROUGH PRACTICAL PROBLEMS. WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFAULT RATE I THINK YOUR QUESTION WENT TO THE ISSUE OF WHAT IS THE LEAST IN A PIECE THE ONE OF THE THINGS WE DISCOVERED IN AB SEVENTY TWO THIS IS IN FACT. THAT THERE IS A LOT OF LUCK TRYING TO BILLING GOING ON ALREADY IN THE BILLING COMPANIES WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFAULT RATE IS WE'VE INVOKED AB SEVENTY TWO THE RATE THERE WAS A HUNDRED THE GREATER OF A 125% OF MEDICARE OR THE AVERAGE CONTRACTED RATE. WE ARE PROPOSED TO USE THE SAME METHODOLOGY FOR THE AVERAGE CONTRACTED RATE HERE WHICH IS THE AVERAGE CONTRACTED RATE. FOR THAT SERVICE FOR THAT HEALTH PLAN FOR THAT GEOGRAPHIC AREA WE ARE OF COURSE ALWAYS WILLING TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATION -- WITH THE OPPOSITION ABOUT YOU KNOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS OUR AUTHOR HAS SENT. I'M STILL AND IN OBVIOUS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IT'S IT'S COMPLICATED I'VE. LOOK I WE LIVE TO AB SEVENTY TWO THIS IS LIKE THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING QUITE FRANKLY -- BECAUSE IT IT IS HAS BECOME INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED AND THERE ARE OTHER CHALLENGES AND AND NOW WE'RE NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT THIS ASPECT OF IT RELATED TO EMERGENCY CARE -- I'M JUST STILL. MAYBE IT'S LATE AB I MY BLOOD SUGAR IS LOW -- ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT I'M STILL A LITTLE PUZZLED THAT YOU KNOW I I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. THAT. EVERY HOSPITAL IS GOING TO DO LIKEWISE. REGARDLESS AND TAKE THE PATIENT OUT OF THIS THAT'S THAT WILL THAT WOULD BE THE INTENT YES EXACTLY INTENT BUT IT BUT WHAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT ALL ALL HOSPITALS WILL ACTUALLY DO THAT. I I THINK THAT TO BOTH -- SPONSORED BOTH THE SPONSOR AND THE OWES PERSPECTIVE AND THEN ON PREVIOUS WORK WE'VE DONE -- I DON'T KNOW MY HOSPITALS ALL OF THEIR ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS BUT THE IDEA WOULD YOU YOU KNOW THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN FIGURE OUT IF THE PATIENT. HAS INSURANCE. SO AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE INSURANCE AND THERE'S CHARITY CARE POLITIES POLICIES THAT THEY CAN THEN VISIT BUT IF THERE THERE'S WAYS TO FIGURE I THINK WE WOULD WORK TO FIND THOSE WAYS OUT I I JUST CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERY ELECTRONIC SYSTEM IN THAT -- TO TO ASSURE YOU TODAY THAT THEY COULD LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS LIKE TEN IT DOES BUT I'M SURE MANY OF THEM BEHIND ME RIGHT NOW ARE NODDING THAT THEY DO THAT ALREADY. I GUESS BECAUSE THE INTENT OF THE BILL WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE IS TO GET THE PAY IS NOT MAKE SURE THAT THE PAIN WE ARE OUT OF THIS AND AND SO -- SO I HEAR THAT ONE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. KIND OF DOES THAT ALREADY. YEAH SOUNDS LIKE IT I JUST DIDN'T HAVE ASSURANCE FROM EVERY SYSTEM AS I WALKED UP HERE THAT THEY HAVE THE SYSTEM BUT I I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT THEY HAVE THEY COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT SO TO GET THE PATIENT ON THE METAL. I THINK OUR BIGGEST STRUGGLE LIKE WE SAID IS THAT DEFAULT RATE SO THEN WHEN SO NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE HOSPITAL NOW TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR REGIONAL RATE IS -- FOR THE PLAN AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT BUILDING IS GOING TO BE IN A SIMILAR KNOWLEDGE I THINK THERE IS A MYTH METHODOLOGY FOR THAT AND AND I THINK OUR CONCERN IS THAT IT'S GOING TO DRIVE THREE TIMES BUT WE WE DON'T HAVE TO REHASH THAT. ONE SO OKAY WELL. BUT ALSO CASH OBVIOUSLY THERE ISN'T ANY RESIDUE AYE I KNOW THE AUTHORS COMMITTED TO AND I KNOW THAT THEIR WE CONTINUE COULD DISCUSSIONS. AND I PLAN TO FOLLOW THEM VERY CLOSELY. SO -- SO I THEBILL DOES HAVE A TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS RECOMMENDATION -- DOUBLE OR QUESTIONS. WE DON'T HAVE A MOTION YET AS FAR AS OF MOTION. OKAY MOTION BY MISTER MCCARTY SECOND BY MISS CARILLO -- MADAM SECRETARY. WELL WELL WAIT A SECOND. MR TO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I'M SORRY IT'S HOURS ARE. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION THE COMMITTEE -- ALSO VERY MUCH WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR YOUR INVOLVING OF THIS -- OVER THE RECESS LAST WEEK WHAT WE ABOUT TRAVELING -- AND I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION -- TO TO THE HOSPITAL WORLD I ACTUALLY HAD THIS VERY CONVERSATION WITH MR PASSED YESTERDAY I THINK WHAT TEN IT IS DOING IS A GOOD MODEL -- AND IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW IF IF OTHERS WOULD BE ABLE -- TO TO ABIDE BY THAT BUT VERY MUCH LOOK FOR TO OTHER CONVERSATIONS I WOULD JUST SAY THE END OF THE DAY WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS THAT THE POTENTIAL SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO COULD BE IN THIS SITUATION BECAUSE THEY GET INTO THE WRONG. AMBULANCE AND UP IN THE WRONG EMERGENCY ROOM THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE THE WRONG INSURANCE THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO GET COVERAGE THAT'S WERE TRYING TO HELP HERE AND I KNOW WE ALL AGREE ON THAT AND OUR HOPE IS -- IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE OTHER DETAILS TO IT TO GET THE STOCK SO WITH THAT VERY MUCH. AS FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITHOUT MADAM SECRETARY THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS A MINUTE TO APPROPRIATIONS AND PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT WOULD I MAYES?

WE'VE BEEN WAITING IN A COMMITTEE FOR QUORUM ALL DAY -- AB SIXTY NINETY MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT. SIXTEEN NINETEEN MENTAL HEALTH CAREERS UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FUNDING. AND AB SIXTEEN NINETEEN APPROPRIATES TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. FOR THE PURPOSE OF REDUCING THE SHORTAGE OF ANNA DISPARITY IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE. WELL ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE IN CALIFORNIA WAS BOLSTERED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA MANY PATIENTS ARE STILL LEFT UNSERVED DUE TO THE DRASTIC SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. CURRENTLY PRACTICING IN CALIFORNIA THE NUMBER BECOMES EVEN FEWER WHEN IDENTIFYING MENTAL HEALTH. PROVIDERS OF COLOR THAT GREW UP IN LOW INCOME OR RULE COMMUNITIES STUDIES SHOW THAT STUDENTS WHO GREW UP IN UNDERSERVED AREAS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SET UP. PRACTICE IN THE AREA WHERE THEY BECOME PHYSICIANS DENTIST OR OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. AB SIXTY NINETEEN CAPITALIZE ON THIS TRAIN BY CREATING AN OUTREACH PROGRAM TO ATTRACTED RECOUP STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME AN UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND TO THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSION AND INCREASING FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO WANT TO GIVE BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. I HAVE WITH ME JEFF AUSTIN DON WHO'S A CO DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I'M JEFF OXEN NINE AM -- HAS SERVED AS THE CO DIRECTOR THE FUTURE CALIFORNIA HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION THE COMMERCIAL COMMISSION WAS FUNDED% BY THE STATE'S FIVE LARGEST HEALTH FOUNDATIONS AND SPENT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. DEVELOPING RECOMMENDATIONS TO ME CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT AND EMERGING HEALTH WORKFORCE NEEDS THE COMMISSION WAS CHAIRED BY JANET POLITICIAN OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UC SYSTEM IN LLOYD DEAN THAT CEO OF DIGNITY HEALTH AND HAD. TWENTY FOUR THIS TEAM LEADERS INCLUDING ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD -- THE COMMISSION COMPLETED ITS REPORT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH WORKFORCE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA AND FILL GAPS BY TWENTY THIRTY IN THE REPORT WAS COMPLETED IN FEBRUARY. THE COMMISSION DID NOT TAKE A POSITION ON LEGISLATION AND I'M NOT HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF THE COMMISSION I'M HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE. TECHNICAL EXPERTISE BASED ON MY WORK WITH THE COMMISSION. AND MY OVER THIRTY YEARS OF WORK -- LEADING A NEW STATEWIDE HEALTH PIPELINE PROGRAM FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS GETTING IN THE HEALTH CAREERS AS WELL AS BEING A FACULTY MEMBER AT UC BERKELEY AND A STATE WIDE. HEALTH WORKFORCE DIVERSITY COALITION LEADER -- BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE AND GROWING SHORTAGES IN OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORK FORCE THE COMMISSION PRIORITIZED -- MEETING OR MENTAL HEALTH WORK FORCE NEEDS AS ONE THE TOP -- THREE PRIORITIES AMONG ALL THE DIFFERENT HEALTH PROFESSIONS. AND WE APPLAUD AND THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ACTION TO ADDRESS THIS BEHAVIOR HEALTH CRISIS. IT WILL NOT SELF CORRECT AND WE NEED SIGNIFICANT ACTION INVESTMENT NOW IN ORDER TO MEET OUR FUTURE NEEDS -- THESE THIS CRISIS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME IT'S ONLY WORSENING -- WE HAVE SEVERE SHORTAGES SUPPLY DISTRIBUTION -- DIVERSITY -- CHALLENGES THAT ARE ONLY PROJECTED TO WORSEN THE NEXT DECADE AND BEYOND. WE ONLY HAVE TWO THIRDS OF THE PSYCHIATRISTS. THAT WE NEED OVERALL. I ALSO HAVE GROWING NEEDS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS SOCIAL WORK OTHER MANY OTHER AT THERAPISTS. EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSION SHORTAGE AREAS -- AND THE NEED IS GREATER THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BUT IN PARTICULAR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE INLAND EMPIRE. A LOS ANGELES IN IN ALL OF THE RURAL AREAS AND DIVERSITY IN CULTURAL LINGUISTIC COMPETENCE. ARE REALLY A KEY CHALLENGE -- ONLY 5% OF PSYCHIATRISTS IN THE LA AREA FOR EXAMPLE ARE LATINO ALMOST 50% OF THE POPULATION. AN AFRICAN AMERICANS NATIVE AMERICANS AND MANY OTHER POPULATIONS ARE DEFINITELY UNDER REPRESENTED -- SO THE THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT WE HAVE ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIANS YOU AREN'T GETTING THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- ARE FAR CANCER FOUNDATION A POLL IN JANUARY IDENTIFIED THAT. NINE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE. SAY THE GETTING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT A POLICY PRIORITY. AND HAVE THE CALIFORNIANS DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE ENOUGH WORKERS IN THERE CAN BE SO THIS THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY. A CRITICAL TO BUILD THE PIPELINE -- STARTING K.

THANK YOU. WE GOT FIVE THOSE WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THIS ON CALL. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER MOVING ON TO MISTER FRAZIER -- ON ITEM NUMBER FIFTY FIVE AB. SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE AND MISTER FRAZIER JUST BECAUSE OF THE TIME AND KNOWING THAT FOLKS IT'S WAITED FOR A LONG LONG TIME FOR YOUR WITNESSES -- MAKING SURE THAT -- WE DON'T WE ARE TOO LONG WINDED -- THIS THIS EVENING. BUT THE FLOOR IS YOURS. MR MAYS I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND I'LL PARAPHRASE MY FIFTEEN MINUTES OF NOTES. OF MR MEMBERS. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE WILL ALLOW SOLANO COUNTY TO CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE TO BOARDING CARE FACILITIES ON THE COUNTY'S HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES CAMPUS. THIS WOULD FACILITATE SURE HOSPITALIZATION STAYS WHILE PROVIDING MORE SUPPORT OF DISCHARGE PLACEMENTS ARE CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SYSTEM DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH. COMMUNITY PLACEMENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS READY TO LEAVE LOCKED FACILITIES AND IF A LOCAL BETTIS FOUND THERE'S LITTLE TO NO INTEGRATION OF CRITICAL SERVICES TO PROPERLY MONITOR SUPPORT THEM. AND SUPPORT THEM WITH THE GOAL OF PREVENTING RELAPSE RE HOSPITALIZATION. AND POTENTIAL RING CAR SICK. REINCARNATION. AND I WILL NOW SHARE IT WITH MY WITNESSES. THANK YOU PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I I'M DOCTOR BILL MUCH CASH ON THE HEALTH OF SERVICE ON A COUNTY WHERE I OVERSEE THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS IN THE UP THE MEDICAL CLINICS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CARE AT PRESENT FOR PERSONS WHO HAVE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES IS SILENT IN IS FREQUENTLY VERY FRAGMENTED -- SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS AS A GROUP REQUIRE A CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FROM OUTPATIENT TO BOARDING CARE TO AUGMENTED BOARDING CARE TOO IMPATIENT. TO CRISIS STABILIZATION. IN ADDITION CLIENTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES ALSO NEED INFORMED COORDINATED PHYSICAL CARE AS WELL AS PROPERLY CASE MANAGE SOCIAL SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE WITH HOUSING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY KNOW THE COMMUNITY. AT THE PRESENT TIME THE ELEMENTS ON THE CONTINUE OF AN OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE GENERALLY OPERATE AS ISOLATED ENEMY AS ISOLATED ENTITIES. IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM ALSO VERY OFTEN RESULTS IN A FAILURE TO ASSURE PROPER PHYSICAL CARE FOR MENTAL HEALTH CLIENTS AND AS A CONSEQUENCE. SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS TYPICALLY DIE OF TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES IN THEIR DEATHS ARE LARGELY FROM PREVENTABLE AND MANAGEABLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE BY SUMMER FRAZIER PROVIDES FOR A UNIQUE PILOT TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL CLIENTS IN A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED FASHION. WITH FUNDS PROVIDED BY THIS PILOT SOLANO COUNTY PROPOSES TO BUILD A MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY THAT OFFERS BOTH BOARDING CARE AN AUGMENTED BOARDING CARE SERVICES FOR UP TO THIRTY TWO CLIENTS IT'S THEM ON THE SAME CAMPUS. AND WHICH WE OFFER AT THE PRESENT TIME OUTPATIENT HEALTH TREATMENT CRISIS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICES SUCH AS MEDICARE ON FOOD ASSISTANCE. PRIMARY CARE AND DENTAL HEALTH. IN CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES HELP THESE CLIENTS NAVIGATE HOUSING OPTIONS AND ACCESS THE SUPPORT SERVICES THAT THEY NEED SO IN ESSENCE. THE PILOT WILL PROVIDE FOR MOST OF THE CONTINUUM OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE TO BE PRESENT ON OUR CURRENT CAMPUS. WHICH IS ALSO THE SAME CAMPUS WHERE WE WILL BE ABLE TO COORDINATE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND THEIR NEED FOR SOCIAL SERVICES AND THEN IN ADDITION WITH THE INVOLVEMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WILL MAKE IT. A POINT TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED CARE MODEL THAT SPRINT THAT'S PROPOSED BY THIS PILOT. THANK YOU SO MUCH JIM OTHER WITNESS. YES GOOD EVENING I'M SEEING PERSONS ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR AT SOLANO COUNTY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE. ARE THE THE AS MENTIONED THE PROPOSAL IS TO ADD THIRTY TWO UNLOCKED BOARDING CARE BEDS -- ON OUR COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE LIGHT WHICH WE THINK BEST. BRIDGES THE GAP BETWEEN LOCKED TO CARE AND COMMUNITY INDEPENDENCE OR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. MINUTES BOARD HOUSING IS ALSO A HUGE NEED AND WHEN THAT IS ACTUALLY BEING WORKED ON IN OUR JURISDICTION ACROSS THE COUNTY -- WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDS -- BUT WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BEFORE PEOPLE CAN GET TO THAT SPACE IS A SKILL BUILDING TO BE ABLE TO LIVE MORE INDEPENDENTLY. AND TO GET EXTRA SUPPORT IN THE MENTAL HEALTH RECOVERY SO THAT THEY CAN GO ON TO LIVE FULL AND MEANINGFUL LIVES. SO THIS WOULD BE SIXTEEN BEDS THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER AUGMENTED BORDEN CARE SETTING WHICH IS BASICALLY A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM. FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND THEN SIXTEEN BEDS THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A LOWER LEVEL OF KERR. REGULAR BOARDING CARE -- WITH -- WITH A LIGHTER -- STAFFING. RATIO -- SO WHAT WHAT WE THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS CONCEPT IS THAT IS VERY FLEXIBLE WITHIN THE SYSTEM OF CARE SO IT CAN IT CAN MEET THE NEEDS BETWEEN THE ACUTE AND THE COMMUNITY. AND N. A FLEXIBLE WAY AND AS WELL AS PREVENT. LIFT USING. AS A STEP DOWN FROM THE CUTE HI HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENTS -- OR AS A PREVENTION TO THAT LEVEL OF CARE THAT SO WE SEE IT HAPPENING IN BOTH IN BOTH DIRECTIONS FOR INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION. AND THE PLAN THAT PRINCIPLE REALLY IS SUPPORTED. BY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT REQUIRES OF US TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT THERE PLEASE RESEARCH OF LEVEL OF CARE POSSIBLE. SO -- WE THANK YOU FOR OUR CONSIDERING THIS BILL AND ARE. OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS FANTASTIC WILL MOVE TO ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. SEE NOW WILL COME BACK TO A MEMBERS OF FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER FLOOR I THINK THAT SECOND WAS MISS CARILLO OR THE IS THAT RIGHT MISSING. THE OKAY WELL FANTASTIC -- MISTER FRAZIER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOREVER. THANK YOU SO MUCH SO SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS WHAT MAYES HI MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY AGUIAR-CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BONTA. BURKE CARRILLO. I FLORA FLORA I LIVE ALONE. MCCARTY. THIRTY AYE IN THIS AREA. RAMOS RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ AYE SANTIAGO. WALDRON. WALDRON AYE. SEVENTIES WAS WE GOT SEVEN VOTES FOR NOW WILL LEAVE THOSE THAT THE ON CALL AND I'M SURE WILL BE A PROBLEM GET NOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU OLD MEMBERS FOR YOUR MARATHON WORK -- THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER I'M MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER FIFTY SIX AB -- SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE DAILY. AND MR DAILY THIS ALSO HAS A SUPPORT SUPPORT -- RECOMMENDATION I GET IT ALL RIGHT I GET IT [inaudible] MOVE THE THANK YOU. I KNOW I LIKE HIS ROOMMATE IS. MY FAVORITE COMMITTEE -- I WILL RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE I DO HAVE. TO EXPERT WITNESSES SO IN CASE THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS OR IF YOU NEED ANY ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND. THANK IF YOU DO HAVE ANY -- ANY COMMENTS YOU CAN BE VERY VERY BRIEF LIKE I'M NOT SURE A NEEDED I AM I WAS LISTENING CAREFULLY -- BASICALLY THE BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ADOPT BEST PRACTICES FOR RECOVERY HOUSING -- RIGHT NOW IN OUR STATE THERE'S NO AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR FINDING RECOVERY RESIDENCES THAT ARE SAFE FOR ESIDENTS AND COMMUNITIES ALIKE. BY ADOPTING BEST PRACTICES FOR RECOVERY RESIDENCES OUR STATE WILL TAKE A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SAFE RESIDENCES FOR PEOPLE. SEEKING RECOVERY SERVICES. MY TWO WITNESSES ARE SHERRY DAILY FROM THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS NO RELATION BY THE WAY DIFFERENT SPELLING OF DAILY. SHE SPELLS AT THE CHICAGO WAY. AND RYAN HAMPTON A RECOVERY ADVOCATE WHO IS HIMSELF AND RECOVERY FROM OPIOID ADDICTION. SO THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF THE BILL -- BEST PRACTICES ARE WHAT WE ARE SEEKING. AND IF THE WITNESS IS SUPPORT JUST WANNA BE QUICK THAT WOULD BE GREAT EMMA PASSES BACK OVER TO THE CHAIR. GREAT HE'S TOUGH SO GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SO MUCH MY NAME IS RYAN HAMPTON I'M A PERSON RECOVERY FROM A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER I'D LIKE. TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY -- I PROMISE I WILL BE BRIEF -- IT IS AN HONOR TO SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPACT THE AB. SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE WILL HAVE ON CALIFORNIANS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AND I MUST SAY IT IS LONG PAST TIME THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF BROKE SOBRE HOMES IN OUR STATE. WELL AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE IS NOT A COMPLETE FIX TO THE PROBLEM IT IS A POSITIVE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE A SAFE RECOVERY RESIDENTS SAVE MY LIFE BUT I AM ALSO HERE TODAY. BECAUSE MY FRIEND TYLER DIED OF A HEROIN OVERDOSE -- IN A SOBER HOME BECAUSE THERE WAS NO NO LOCKS AND ON SITE BECAUSE THE HOME STAFF WORK TRAINED TO DEAL WITH OVERDOSES MY FRIEND. LOST HIS LIFE. COMMON SENSE MEASURES LIKE NALOXONE ETHICAL STANDARDS AND PROTECTIONS FOR PROOF FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO RECOVER ARE CRUCIAL IF WE WANT TO SAVE LIVES. MY FRIEND'S DEATH WAS 1100% PREVENTABLE AND AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE BEGINS TO ADDRESS THE CHANGES WE NEED IN ORDER TO ENSURE. THAT RECOVERY HOMES ARE SAVING LIVES NOT ENDANGERING THEM WE MUST HAVE BEST PRACTICES IN RECOVERY HOUSING IMPLEMENTED. AS I SIT HERE CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING EXPLOITED AND LOWERED INTO UNSAFE RESIDENCES. FAMILIES HAVE NO WAY OF IDENTIFYING SAFE RELIABLE OPERATORS AND OUR STATE CONTINUES TO LOSE OVER FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE PER YEAR TO OVERDOSE DEATHS. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS A CRISIS AND THIS LEGISLATURE AND THIS COMMITTEE HAS A MANDATE TO DO THEIR JOB AND PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE. WE HAVE GOT TO END THIS EXPLOITATION AND ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A WAY TO TELL THE REPUTABLE FROM THE PREDATORY WITHOUT THESE MEASURES IN PLACE WE WILL CONTINUE. TO LOSE PEOPLE LIKE MY FRIEND TYLER. PEOPLE WHO ACCESS CONTINUING CARE. ASK FOR HELP IN GOOD FAITH AND WE MUST ENSURE THAT THEIR SAFETY NET IS STRONG SAFE AND READY TO CATCH THEM THANK YOU SO MUCH. SHERRIE TAYLOR SEE CAP I WON'T TALK OF A SPORT SPORT THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KERR CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST -- OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION FOR THE SAME REASON WE USUALLY OPPOSE THESE -- BILLS THAT THE TEMP -- TO DEFINE TO RESTRICT -- THE RECOVERY RESIDENCES -- THE SCOPE OF THE OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT THIS BILL PUTS ON RECOVERY -- RESIDENCES PRETTY EXTRAORDINARILY BROAD CREATES A VAST SCHEME OF CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS OF A PRIVATE ENTITY. AND REALLY LAUNDERS BY REQUIRING DH CS TO AND TO ADOPT THEM AUTHORIZES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- TO REPORT THE LACK OF COMPLIANCE TO DH CS IT ALLOWS THE REALLY THE PUBLIC SHAMING -- OF RECOVERY RESIDENCES THAT HAVEN'T MET THE THE REQUIREMENTS WITH THE ULTIMATE RESULT IS THAT WE LOSE THOSE RESIDENCES. AS BEING AVAILABLE -- FOR FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ACTUALLY NEED THEM BUT IMPORTANTLY I I THINK AS YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY BEFORE THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE BOAT BILL -- IMPOSES ON INDIVIDUALS IN NON CERTIFIED RECOVERY RESIDENCES RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE NOT IMPOSED ON FAMILIES -- OR GROUPS OF A SIMILAR SIZE -- OUR POSITION IS BANNED WHERE A HOUSEHOLD WHERE TWO OR MORE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES CHOOSE TO LIVE TOGETHER -- THEY MAY NOT BE SUBJECTED TO REQUIREMENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT ARE -- IMPOSED ON A HOUSEHOLDS CONSISTING OF PERSONS WITH -- WITH DISABILITIES BOTH -- REQUIRED BY -- THE FAIR HOUSING ACT THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT. WE HAVE CURRENTLY A SEVERE HOUSING SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA I DON'T NEED -- TO TELL YOU ALL THAT AND THERE'S A DRAMATIC NEED -- FOR SOBER LIVING PAT CERTAINLY IN THE STATE AS WELL WE THINK THE EFFECT OF THIS BILL WILL EXASPERATED -- THOSE -- DEFICIENCIES AND AND MAKE IT ACTUALLY EASIER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO NIMBY THEM OUT OF THEIR COMMUNITIES FOR THAT REASON WE POST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEE NUMBER BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE THE BILL DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION MISTER DALY WHICH YOU LIKE. THANK YOU THANK YOU WHILE I RESPECT THE CONCERNS OF THE DISABILITY RIGHTS -- ORGANIZATION I THINK THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE -- ON THIS SUBJECT -- WITH ADDICTION AND THE GROWING PROBLEM OF DICTION IS TOO MUCH AT STAKE NOT TO HAVE -- AT LEAST MINIMAL STANDARDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER FLORA SECOND BY MISS CARILLO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHERE. WOULD I MAYES MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY I BIGELOW BONTA BURKE [inaudible] CARILLO. I FLORA FLORA AYE LIMóN MCCARTY. THIS AREA RAMOS RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ AYE SANTIAGO WALDRON [inaudible] HI. YES SEVEN VOTES WITH THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU TO IT TO ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY -- LET'S SEE THIS OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- BESIDE YOUR KERR. TO GET DOWN THERE FOR MINIMUM DOWN. MOVE THE BILL [inaudible] SEC. KEVIN MOTION MOTION AND A SECOND. SURE THAT THERE'S WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE MOST RISK. THEY DO IT THE SECOND. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AB SEVEN FOUR FOUR CREATES TRUE TELL HEALTH PARITY SO THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. REGARDLESS OF THE LOCATION AND PROVIDERS CAN EXPAND THE REACH TO SERVE THOSE THAT MAY BE OUT OF RANGE. THIS BILL STRENGTHENS NONDISCRIMINATION STATUTES IN EXISTING LAW TO ENSURE THAT A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IS REIMBURSED FOR SERVICES DELIVERED TO AN ENROLLEE TO TELEHEALTH IF THOSE SAME SERVICES ARE COVERED WHEN PROVIDED IN PERSON. THIS BILL DOES NOT EXPAND ANY SERVICES THAT ARE COVERED IT ONLY ADDRESSES THEM MODALITY USE IT TO PROVIDE THOSE COVERED SERVICES. BY UPDATING TELEHEALTH DEFINITIONS AND CONTRACTING Là AB SEVEN FORTY FOUR WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS OR WHO HAVE BEEN DISPLACED BY NATURAL DISASTERS OF ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE. I'M GOING TO PASS IT OFF TO MY SUPPORTERS NOW WHO CAN SPEAK OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH TELL HEALTH AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ANY DURBIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BELL I'M JUST BRIEFLY IN 200-011-8415 WAS PASSED TO ESTABLISH THE TELEHEALTH ADVANCEMENT ACT TO REVISE AND UPDATE EXISTING LAW TO FACILITATE ADVANCEMENT OF TELEHEALTH HAS A SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL. FOR THE MANAGED CARE AND MEDICAL PROGRAM ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS OF THAT LEGISLATION WAS TO ENSURE THAT SERVICES PROVIDED THREE TELL HEALTH WOULD NOT BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY BY PAIRS -- THAN THOSE PROVIDED IN PERSON. UNFORTUNATELY AT TODAY AS A RECENT STUDY BY THE CENTER FOR CONNECTED HEALTH POLICY HAS SHOWN ALL PAIRS DO CONTINUE TO LIMIT TELEHEALTH REIMBURSEMENT IN SOME WAY SUCH AS TYPES OF SERVICES REIMBURSED. AND MODALITY USE WITH ONLY FEW OFFERING COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF TELEHEALTH MODALITIES -- OUT OF THAT STUDY STATED IT IT MAKES CLEAR THAT THERE'S A BROAD MISCONCEPTION THAT BECAUSE PRIVATE HERE LAWS ARE IN PLACE. THAT WERE ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THE PROMISE OF THOSE PARITY BENEFITS -- WITH IN PERSON CARE AND SO THERE FOR EIGHTY SEVEN FORTY FOUR SEEKS TO PROVIDE THAT CLARITY BY STRENGTHENING THAT EXISTING LAW PROPERTY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WHAT ASSEMBLYMEMBERS I'M DAN PETERSON CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER FOR SUTTER LAKESIDE HOSPITAL. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF SUTTER HEALTH IN SUPPORT OF AB. SEVEN FORTY FOUR I SUTTER LAKESIDE HOSPITALS A TWENTY FIVE BED CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL PART OF THE SUTTER HEALTH NETWORK AT TWENTY FOUR HOSPITALS. OUT WE'RE LOCATED IN LAKE COUNTY WERE THE ONLY CERTIFIED STROKE CENTER TRAUMA CENTER LAKE COUNTY. LAKE COUNTY RECENTLY RANKED FIFTY EIGHT OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT ON OUR OUR STATES COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS. WE HAVE 25% OF OUR RESIDENTS UNDER THE NATIONAL POVERTY LEVEL. NOW WE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CHALLENGE COUNTY -- WE HAVE MANY CHALLENGES AROUND HEALTH PARTICULARLY AROUND ACCESS TO CARE AND ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE IN PARTICULAR I CAN TELL YOU SOMEONE TRYING TO RECRUIT PHYSICIANS TO THE AREA -- IT IS NO EASY TASK AT PARTICULAR GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE RURAL AREA -- I EXPECT I EXPERIENCE THIS LACK OF SPECIALIST FIRST HAND SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH MY ONE YEAR OLD SON -- WHO IS DIAGNOSED OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUE? FOR WHICH WE HAD TO TRAVEL THREE HOURS TO SAN FRANCISCO -- FOR ROUTINE INTRODUCTORY APPOINTMENTS WHICH COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN HANDLED THROUGH TELEHEALTH THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THE NATURE OF THIS APPOINTMENT THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN -- THROUGH THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES OUT WE WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE MEANS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE MAJORITY MY COMMUNITY DOES NOT -- IN ADDITION TO THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT. THAT PREVENT ACCESS TO CARE -- WE WERE DEVASTATED IN OUR COMMUNITY WITH THE WILD FIRES LAST LAST FALL IN RIGHT CALIFORNIA -- WE EVACUATE OUR HOSPITAL FOR TWO WEEKS DUE TO THE MEDICINE -- COMPLEX FIRE. AND DURING THIS TIME. WE WERE ABLE TO FORTUNATELY LEAN UPON THE SUTTER HEALTH NETWORK OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND AFFILIATED CLINICIANS -- TO PROVIDE VIDEO VISITS ANOTHER TELEHEALTH SERVICES TO MANY OF OUR PATIENTS AND THEIR GREATEST TIME WE NEED. WE MADE THE CONSCIOUS DECISION TO DO SO NOT KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT. THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE REIMBURSED FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DID AT THAT TIME. THAT IS NOT AN EASY DECISION MAKE BUT IS IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION FOR OUR COMMUNITY AT THE TIME I SIMILARLY FEEL A. B. SEVEN FORTY FOUR IS THE RIGHT DECISION FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHER SUPPORT. NEAR MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL CESSATION IN SUPPORT. KIM CRACK ON BEHALF OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GARY COOPER ON BEHALF OF CAL GERMAN SUPPORT THANK YOU. HI KELLY MAC MILLAN ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN'S CARE SPECIALLY CALL THE SENSE. THANK YOU. RENTS SPENCER PAP THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS AND SPORT THANK YOU. HI MELISSA CORTEZ ROTH ON BEHALF OF AUTISM SPEAKS AND THE CENTER FOR AUTISM RELATED DISORDERS I'M A LITTLE BIT OF A TWEENER WE HAVE A SUPPORT OF AMEND POSITION. AS DRAFTED THE BILL RIGHT NOW WOULD NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN QUALIFIED AUTISM SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO COULD YOU DO TELL HEALTH SERVICES -- THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LICENSED BY THE STATE WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND EXPECT TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE [inaudible] ZURICH OPPOSITION GOOD EVENING JENNIFER ONLY WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS -- AND CAP MUST IMPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IT WILL INCREASE RESULT IN AN INCREASE AND CONSUMER PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES -- IN OUR OPINION THIS BILL SIMPLY IS NOT NECESSARY -- TELEHEALTH IS ALREADY ALLOWED IN HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS BUILD TELL HEALTH INTO THEIR NETWORKS WITHIN THE EXISTING STATUTE REGULATIONS. THESE EXISTING STATUTORY REGULATIONS ALSO INCLUDE CONSUMER PROTECTION REGARDING TELL HEALTH SERVICES -- PATIENTS CANNOT BE COERCED INTO USING TELEHEALTH BY THE PROVIDER OR HEALTH PLAN AND THERE IS PAYMENT PARITY PAYMENT PARITY MEANING COPAYMENTS DEDUCTIBLES. ARE THE SAME FOR TELEHEALTH AS AN IN PERSON VISIT. OUR MEMBER COMPANIES COMPANIES. EXCUSE ME CANNOT DO ALLOW FOR THE USE OF TELEHEALTH FOR THEIR ENROLLEES IN INSURANCE IS DEFINED IN STATUTE. HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE A ROBUST ROBUST NETWORK OF PROVIDERS. IN IN BUILDING THESE NETWORKS TELL HEALTH PROVIDERS ARE USING CURRENTLY CONTRACT HEALTH PLANS. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILLS THAT CIRCUMVENTS THE PROVIDER CONTRACTING PROCESS BY DICTATING WHAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR TELEHEALTH SERVICES SHALL BE. REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR PROVIDERS ARE TYPICALLY INAPPROPRIATELY DETERMINED IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WHEN CONTRACTING WITH PROVIDERS FOR SERVICES. MULTIPLE FACTORS ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY THE PLANT AND THIS BILL FAILS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REDUCTION OF FACILITY ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER. OVERHEAD COSTS WHEN COMPARED TO TELEHEALTH. AND SO IT AS I PRESENTED WITH EARLIER. BILLS EARLIER TODAY WE JUST DON'T SUPPORT. ON ANY BILLS ARE GOING TO INCREASE THE PREMIUMS ARE -- COPAYMENTS FOR PARMALEE THANK YOU. SEVENTY ONE CAN FINALLY HAPPENED THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WITH ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE I THINK OUR MEMBERS ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT TELEHEALTH WE SEE IT AS A VITAL. INNOVATIVE OPTION FOR PATIENTS TO GET THEM A LOT OF TIME. A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY WITH PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES AND OTHER OPTIONS TO USE THAT UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL REALLY DOES MANDATE CONTRACT NEGOTIATION TERMS IN STATUTE. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT IT DOES PREVENT US FROM SO SOURCE CONTRACTING SOME OF OUR MEMBERS DO YOU USE THIRD PARTY VENDORS THEY'RE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE BETTER RATES WITH THOSE VENDORS PROVIDE THESE VITAL SERVICES. WHICH THEN EQUATES TO LOWER PREMIUMS FOR OUR MEMBERS SO YET AGAIN IN A TIME WHEN WE ARE INCREDIBLY PRICE SENSITIVE. WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. THESE OPTIONS OF NEGOTIATING THESE PRICES DO. FOR WAR AT THAT CONSUMERS WITH LOWER PREMIUMS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED THE BILL. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT CAPITA CLICK. HERE. KAREN SIR KISSING WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN A BOOK IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS COMES FROM COMING. MIKE I GUESS MY QUESTION IS I'M I I GUESS I'M STILL A LITTLE PUZZLED AS TO WHY. YOU THE HEALTH PLANS FEEL THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE COSTS. ON THE WAY THAT THE BILL WAS DRAFTED ACCORDING TO THE CHEAPER BUT NOW SAYS DO THE INCREASE UTILIZATION TELL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE RATE SPECIFIED IN THE BILL. IT'S ANTICIPATED INCREASE PREMIUMS BY TWO HUNDRED MILLION AN OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES FOR ENROLLEES FIFTY MILLION. SO THIS INCREASED UTILIZATION MIGHT BE FROM PEOPLE WHO MIGHT APPEAL TO ACCESS A DOCTOR. BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN A REALLY POOR COMMUNITY. OR THEY CAN'T THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DRIVE TO THREE HOURS LIKE OUR HOSPITAL CEO DID. SO. IS THIS NOT POTENTIALLY. KIND OF A DIAL OF CARE. I'M I THINK OUR MEMBERS WOULD ABSOLUTELY SUGGEST THE THE INTENT IS NOT TO DENY CARE NOT TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS I MEAN WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT TELL HEALTH KIDS. I THINK THE CONCERN WOULD BE FOR US IS THAT AS WE NEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS. SO SAFE WE USE A THIRD PARTY VENDOR AS AN OPTION WERE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A BETTER CONTRACT IN THE CONTEXT THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GUARANTEEING THEM A CERTAIN SET OF ENROLLEES. THIS BILL WOULD TAKE AWAY THAT FLEXIBILITY FOR US TO DO THAT AND TÁI S. TO AN ESTABLISHED RATE. VERSUS US BEING ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A SECONDARY RATE WITH THE PROVIDER AND SO THAT THAT'S OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE THINK THAT THIS BILL REALLY DOES LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE RATES AND AND LOWER RATES FOR CONSUMERS. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. WELL -- SO THERE'S NO IN THE BILL LANGUAGE AB SEVEN FORTY FOUR ACTUALLY SET THE TELEHEALTH RATE REQUIRE THAT THE RATE BE -- THE SAME AS AN IN PERSON RATE THIS BILL SEEKS TO ENSURE TELE HEALTH PARITY IT DOES NOT DICTATE RATE FOR SERVICES. SO. SOUNDS LIKE YOU AGREE TO DISAGREE YEAH REGULATORS. YOU KNOW IT'S YOU KNOW I IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE PEOPLE IF PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE HEALTH CARE. WHY NOT YEAH THERE MIGHT BE A PRICE INCREASES? FOR CRIME ANY SIX EVERYBODY DESERVES TO HAVE HEALTH CARE. THANK YOU PRIME ANY SIX THAT'S A THAT'S A THAT'S A NAGS THAT'S AN EGG. THING YOU KNEW IT. LARA TO SIX TWENTY FIVE AT NIGHT. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT FOR US. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IF YOU'RE FROM LOS ANGELES? YOU TO RURAL DICTIONARY BECAUSE WE GOT THE URBAN DICTIONARY WILL GIVE. YEAH. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS WHEN. HE WAS CHAIR OF THIS ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD SEEMS TO ME. FOR THE FOR THOSE OF US THAT THAT REPRESENT RURAL AREAS THAT ARE UNDER SERVED THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS. ANY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE. TO TO BE ABLE TO TO INCREASE ACCESS TO THOSE PROVIDERS IS GOING TO BE -- HELPFUL AND SO MAYBE THE BILL ISN'T PERFECT CONTINUE WORK BUT I'M TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY SO. THANKS FOR BEING A FORD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ANYWAY ANYONE ELSE. JUST JUST AS WAS THERE BOB THIS HAS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE WORKING -- IN THE IDEA. YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY I CAN UNDERSTAND WANTING TO GET THE INSURANCE COMES ONE TO GET A BETTER CONTRACTED RATE BUT IT. SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S NOT AGREEMENT ON WHAT YOUR BILL. OR NOT IF YOU'RE NOT YOU GUYS ARE NOT BOTH ON THE SAME PAGE SO -- YOU KNOW I I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY THIS WORKED ON THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THINK -- ARE. A REPRESENTATIVE FROM LAKE COUNTY THE CAME ALL THE WAY HERE HE'S HE'S HE'S SEEN THIS HAPPEN RIGHT HE SPENDS HIS TIME DOING THIS -- I WOULD REMIND ALL OF YOU THAT ARE SITTING UP HERE THAT NATIONAL DOT DISASTERS HAPPEN. AND THIS BILL IS LIKE A VISION I THINK THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE REALLY HAPPY THIS TYPE OF BILL GOES THROUGH. BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW WHAT THE NEXT NATURAL TO DISASTROUS AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR PEOPLE HAVE HEALTH CARE THEY ARE AXIS WHETHER IT'S FLOOD FIREOR NEXT EARTHQUAKE. IT WILL HAPPEN IN ONE OF YOUR COMMUNITIES IS SITTING HERE IT'S NOT JUST THE RURAL AREAS SO TELL HEALTH IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND I REALLY IT WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY.

THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS AND PARENTS IN MY DISTRICT ONE TOPIC THAT CONSISTENTLY ARISES. AS AN AREA OF NEED AS MENTAL HEALTH AND STUDENT WELLNESS A REVIEW OF THE RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC DEMONSTRATES WHY THE PROBLEM HAS BECOME SO CUTE. YOU'VE SUICIDE RATES ARE RISING NEARLY EVERY YEAR AND ARE NOW AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX IN A WORLD WHERE IN RURAL CAROL CALIFORNIA WHERE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE MOST LIMITED. THE SUICIDE RATE IS OFTEN TRIPLE THE STATE AVERAGE FURTHERMORE CALIFORNIA'S MOST RECENT HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY FOUND THAT 34% OF ELEVENTH GRADERS EXPERIENCE CHRONIC SADNESS AND 16% HAVE SERIOUSLY CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THESE ALARMING TRENDS. ACCORDING TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY'S MOST RECENT GETTING DOWN THE FACTS OF THE A MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS. FORTY RENTS OUT OR NEAR THE BOTTOM NATIONALLY FOR STUDENT ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ONE MAJOR BARRIER TO IMPROVE IN THIS IS THAT ELOISE AND SELF WAS CURRENTLY HAVE VERY LIMITED ACCESS TO EAT T. S. T. T. FUNDING. WELL DISTRICTS AND LEDS ARE WELL POSITIONED TO DELIVER SERVICES COVERED BY UPS TV THERE IS CURRENTLY NO WAY FOR ELEAZAR SELF AS TO DIRECTLY ACCESS THOSE DOLLARS. COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS READ RECEIVE FUND DISTRIBUTIONS TO PROVIDE CHILDREN WITH THE PST T. SERVICES BUT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO WORK WITH ELEAZAR SELF AS TO PROVIDE SERVICES AT SCHOOL SITES OR THROUGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THIS CREATES AN UNNECESSARY HURDLE FOR MANY ELEAZAR AND SELF WAS ACROSS THE STATE. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE STATE SHIFTED 1100% OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WANTS ABILITY FROM COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO ELLIE ACE NOW IN MAKING THIS CHANGE. THE STATE SHIFTED MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION A FEDERAL AND STATE DOLLARS TO THE PROP NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF THE STATE BUDGET. TO SERVE THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS BUT DID NOT PROVIDE ELEAZAR WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO EAT P. S. T. D. FUNDING. THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE EPS DD FUNDS IN THE STORE AT THE BEEN PART OF THE FUNDING SOURCE TO SERVE STUDENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. AS A RESULT STATE FUNDS ARE OFTEN USED FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY ELEAZAR L. SELF AS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN FUNDED FEDERALLY THREE PST T.. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES AN ALLEY A INCLUDING SELF AS WHICH IS NOT CONTRACT WITH A MEANT COUNTY WHICH DO NOT CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLAN TO MAKE A DIRECT CLAIM FOR FEDERAL EPS DD FUNDING THROUGH THE ACS. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FEDERAL DOLLARS THE L. E. WOULD NEED TO PUT UP MATCHING FUNDS -- FOR THE EXPENDITURES I HAVE MET WITH ME -- THIS -- THIS EVENING LARA WASCO FROM THE BALL FROST GROUP AS WELL AS A TONY TO GROW WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. GOOD EVENING -- CHAIR MEMBERS LARA MOSCOW WITH THE BALL FROST GROUP AND I'M REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SUBURBAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- HAS THE AUTHOR INDICATED -- ELEAZAR DO NOT HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO THE EASY PST T. FUNDS IT DOESN'T CAUSE A HURDLE -- WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE -- IN THE RIGHT POSITION TO SERVE ALL OF THE STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL SITE WE MAY NOT HAVE ALL THE PROFESSIONALS ON SITE. BUT WE ARE HIRING MORE AND MORE SOCIAL WORKERS AS WELL AS MARRIAGE AND FAMILY COUNSELORS -- TO HELP PROVIDE ALL OF THESE SERVICES THE KEY PART IS WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING COMING FROM. SOME OTHER FUNDING SOURCE WERE USING PROP NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS -- THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE USE FOR THE GENERAL ED POPULATION -- WE'RE REQUESTING A YOUR I BET ON THIS BILL IF YOU HAVE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. TWENTY TWO ZERO THEY HAVE ASSOCIATES SO STATION OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS CTA'S WORKED DILIGENTLY TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS. AT THE SCHOOL SITE WE MET SEVERAL TIMES WITH STAFF AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ASKING FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE AND INVOLVEMENT. THE MARCH FOURTEENTH TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT BY OUR STATE AUDITOR CITED DO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DEFICIENT. DEFICIENT OVERSIGHT OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS THROUGH WHICH AND ROLL. THE REPORT RECOMMENDED A VARIETY OF ACTIONS FOR D. H. C. S. TO INCREASE. CHILDREN'S USE. A MEDI CAL PROVIDED PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND THEREBY IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND REDUCE LONG TERM HEALTH CARE COSTS. ALLOWING LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO MAKE CLAIMS DIRECTLY TO DH CS FOR E. P. S. D. T. SERVICES WILL BENEFIT STUDENTS AT ALL LEVELS AND IS THE REASON CDA SUPPORTS AB. FIFTEEN FORTY SIX AND URGES AND I BOTH. THANK YOU -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT OLDER SHILOH LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SUPPORT. CHRIS LIKE HILLS HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. AARON EVANS ON BEHALF OF THE SELF ADMINISTRATORS. VIDEO BORN CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES ORGANIZATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THREE ONE IN OPPOSITION. NO TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- I HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AND IS THE THIRD TIME THAT SOMEONE'S ATTEMPTED TO DO THIS BILL -- I'M KIND OF AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE BILL QUITE FRANKLY -- ON THE ONE HAND I UNDERSTAND THE NEED -- ACTUALLY I WAS THE ONE WHO COMMISSION THE AUDIT THAT WAS REFERENCED BY. BY BY HER BUT THAT ACTUALLY THAT ONLY YOUR POINTS WERE GERMANE TO THE AUTO SIDE OF TAKE EXCEPTION WITH YOU ON BUT RIGHT NOW WE PST MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE DELIVERED TO COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE -- COUNTIES RECEIVE DEDICATED REALIGNMENT REVENUE FOR THIS -- FOR THIS PURPOSE I KNOW THIS BILL LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES COULD ALSO USE PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT -- TO BUILD THE ACS THROUGH FEE FOR SERVICE OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLAN STRUCTURE. SO MONEY IS SUPPOSED TO GO FOR EDUCATION WOULD GO FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND MEDI CAL. AND THAT WERE ALREADY FUNDING WITH REALIGNMENT REVENUE. I UNDERSTAND SCHOOLS HAVE TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW AND ENCOURAGE THAT -- THAT REQUIRES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BE PROVIDED BUT I'DLIKE TO SEE A FIX ON THE ISSUE. AT ADDRESSES WHY SCHOOLS AND MENTAL HEALTH PLANS DON'T CONTRACT NOW. THAT WOULD BE MUCH SIMPLER. RATHER THAN SET UP A SEPARATE BILLING STRUCTURE. IN WHAT'S ALREADY A FRAGMENTED MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM TRUST ME AS SOMEONE WHO BILL MEDI CAL. IT'S NOT EASY. IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS REALLY THE SOLUTION O HAVE SCHOOLS DO THIS. QUITE FRANKLY AND SO I I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I APPRECIATE THE INTENT. BUT I THINK WHAT WE'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE IS THAT SCHOOLS AND MENTAL HEALTH AND THE COUNTIES ACTUALLY WORK THIS OUT THE RIGHT WAY -- BUT THAT'S THAT THAT'S GONNA BE MY POSITION ON THE BILL TONIGHT SO. ANYBODY ELSE THE ACCOUNT RESPOND. IF I MAY ADD MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE THE CONCERN I THINK WHAT WE'RE FINDING WITH EXPERIENCE IS THAT -- THE ADDITIONAL HURDLE THAT IS REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW IS SERVING AS A BARRIER TO ON WALKING FEDERAL FUNDS -- THAT THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE TO ACTUALLY HELP KIDS ARE K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS BUT IF IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME I'LL DEFER TO MY WITNESSES WATERSHED A LITTLE MORE COLOR WHITE ON THAT. CHAIR UNFORTUNATELY WHEN -- COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH WORK COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO NOT AGREED. THEM BASICALLY THERE IS NO APPEALS PROCESS SO. IF THERE IS NOT AGREEMENT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AGREE ON THE YOUR IN -- DIRECT OF FEES YOU'RE GONNA CHARGE OR WHETHER -- THE STAFFING IS GOING TO BE OR ALL OF THOSE AREAS THAT YOU LOOK AT AN ANIMAL YOU. THEN THERE IS NO APPEALS SO BASICALLY THE TWO AGENCIES WALK AWAY AND UNFORTUNATELY THE KIDS IN THE MIDDLE ARE WHAT'S HURT. I AGREE WITH I THOUGHT I WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE BETTER PARTNERSHIPS BUT WE HAVE HEARD OF UNFORTUNATELY VERY HIGH INDIRECT COSTS BEING CHARGED BY SOME COUNTIES OR PROPOSED TO BE CHARGED BY SOME COUNTIES. WE'VE HEARD OF ALSO THE REQUIREMENT THAT. VENDOR CERTAIN VENDORS BE USED TO COME INTO THE SCHOOLS THAT ISN'T THAT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE IT MAY NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE FOR THE DISTRICT TO TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT -- SO FROM A SCHOOL DISTRICT PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AND HOW WE CAN USE THOSE BEST TO SERVE THOSE STUDENTS. I'M WORDY USING PROP NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS TO SERVE THOSE KIDS IN THIS AREA UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT GETTING THAT EXTRA LITTLE MATCH TO GO WITH THE MEDI CAL. AND THE REASON WHY YOU PST TEA IS SO CRITICAL FOR SCHOOLS IS BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO BILL FOR CERTAIN SERVICES RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT DAY -- SERVICES ADVANCED COUNSELING SERVICES AND OTHERS THAT ARE NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE ONLY A BILLING PROCESS THAT SCHOOLS CURRENTLY USE SO BASICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE HIGH COST PROGRAMS THAT I JUST LISTED. THOSE HIGH DOLLARS WHICH COULD BE UP TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT ARE COMING OUT OF YOUR GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. SO UNFORTUNATELY I AGREE THAT THE TWO AGENCIES AREN'T WORKING IT OUT THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF AGENCIES THAT DO HAVE AMMO USE AND THEY SEEM TO BE GOING WELL BUT THERE IS NO RECOURSE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT TO GO FORWARD. AND GET ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IF THEY CAN AGREE WITH OUR COUNTY. SO I I GUESS I GUESS MY YOU KINDA ILLUSTRATED MY POINT A LITTLE BIT -- WHY ISN'T THE BILL FOCUSED ON THE AN APPEALS PROCESS WHY ISN'T THAT BECAUSE SETTING UP A SEPARATE BILLING SYSTEM TRUST ME BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH? FOR IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT. AND YOU MIGHT FIND THAT IT'S ACTUALLY WORSE THAN WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH NOW BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS TO TRY TO BILL MEDICARE ON THESE COMPLICATED CASES. WE'VE HAD HEARINGS ON MENTAL HEALTH -- THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE AND FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND QUITE FRANKLY -- IT'S DIFFICULT ME WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE PAPERWORK AND TRY TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE TO EXPEDITE SERVICES WE HAD A BILL ABOUT THAT EARLIER TODAY. I DO I JUST THINK I THINK THE BILLS AIMED AT THE WRONG PLACE QUITE FRANKLY TO SET UP A SEPARATE BILLING SYSTEM -- TO DO THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHEN THE PROBLEM APPEARS THAT THE THE THE THE THE TO PETE THE TWO PARTIES DON'T WANT TO DO THIS SO WHY ISN'T THIS BILL FOCUSED. ON A PROCESS AN APPEALS PROCESS SO THAT THE TWO PARTIES CAN WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY WHY IS THE FOCUS JUST SEEMS WRONG AND SO THAT'S WHY CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL. DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT. I'M. WE HAVE A TRIED IN IN PRIOR VERSIONS OF THE BILL THERE WAS A SUGGESTION OF APPEALS PROCESS UNFORTUNATELY THAT DIDN'T GO FORWARD EITHER. SO I YOU KNOW I I I I AGREE WITH YOU AND I AGREE THAT THE BILLING PROCESS IS A DIFFICULT THING IT IT DIFFICULT IS IT WOULD BE AN UNDERSTAND HUGE UNDERTAKING IT WOULD IT WOULD AND I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY IS GOING TO CAUGHT THE YOU'RE. GOING TO FIND IT WOULD COST YOU MORE -- THEN YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO COST I DON'T THINK YOU'LL SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE -- AND I JUST I'M SYMPATHETIC I HAVE HUGE ISSUES WITH THIS IN MY DISTRICT. I HAVE I HAVE HUGE HUGE CHALLENGES AND I GET IT I GET IT BUT I THINK THE THE THE SOLUTION IS ACTUALLY COOPERATION. BETTER CORPORATION AND LIKE THE BIKE I SAID THE BILL PROBABLY SHOULD BE MANDATING AN APPEALS PROCESS THAT'S FAIR FOR ALL. RIGHT IN IN PART OF THE THE IF YOU DON'T MIND ME RESPONDING NOT. WHEN I WAS SENATOR BELL IN THE AUDIT CAME FORWARD THERE WAS A -- AUDIT RECOMMENDATION THAT -- COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS BE MANDATED TO PARTNER IN THESE SERVICES. UNFORTUNATELY SENATOR BUILDING GO FORWARD WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION HE LOOKED AT A DIFFERENT APPROACH TRY NOT TO CREATE A MANDATE. I MEAN WE'D BE WILLING TO GO FORWARD WITH THE MANDATE BUT WITH THAT KILL THE BILL IN THE IN APPROPRIATIONS CAUSING A NEW MANDATE -- IT HELPED THAT THINK THE MANDATE IS ACTUALLY ASKING THE TWO ENTITIES TO WORK TOGETHER I SO I WOULD I JUST HAPPY WITH THE MANDATE I JUST DON'T I JUST DON'T BELIEVE AS I'VE SAID I DON'T BELIEVE THIS ACTUALLY SOLVES THE PROBLEM THE WAY YOU'RE TRYING. THE WAY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR I THINK YOU'RE. POTENTIALLY CREATING A MUCH ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT'S OF A DIFFERENT MAGNITUDE SO. SO THAT'S MY POSITION AND THAT'S WHY I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY SO -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS. WE DO HAVE A MOTION -- MY MISTER FLORA SECOND BY MISTER MAZEN. BELIEVE THE MOTION IS -- TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS -- WILL -- Là MADAM SECRETARY CALLED COVER. WHAT? WOULD NOBODY'S MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY.

ASSEMBLY BILL -- THIRTY ONE SIXTY TWO BY SOME OF ONE FRIEDMAN WAS PASSED LAST YEAR IT REQUIRED SOME TRANSPARENCY SO THAT IMPATIENT WOULD LIST ALL OF THE PLACES WHERE ANY TYPE OF TREATMENT WAS GOING ON AND UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT FOUND IT UNABLE TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO BECAUSE THEY CANNOT PUT A CERTIFIED. OUTPATIENT WHICH IS NOT LICENSED ON A LICENSE SO WE'RE ASKING YOU TO REPAIR THAT DAMAGE SO THAT -- INPATIENT WHO OFTEN WILL HAVE A LIKE A SIX BED WITH. WITH WOMEN AND ONE MIGHT HAVE CHILDREN THAT SHE'S TRYING TO UNITE WITH ONE MIGHT HAVE A TRAUMA ISSUE ANOTHER ONE MIGHT BE -- TRANS GENDER OR LESBIAN AND THEY WOULD ALL HAVE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT MIGHT MEET THEIR NEEDS NOW THEY'RE TRAPPED WITHIN THEIR THE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES DUE TO THIS.

MOVE THE BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY TALKING POINTS A GOOD MORNING. BUT GOOD EVENING. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB IS SIXTEEN NINETY FIVE WHICH MAKES IT NECESSARY. REFORMS TO THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY WHEN A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OF KURDS TO ADDRESS ISSUES WITH TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THE CONTINUED THE CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AS WELL AS THE EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS. FOR WORKERS -- DURING THIS PROCESS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING CERTIFYING AND ENFORCING. REGULATORY STANDARDS RELATED TO THE QUALITY CARE PROVIDED IN SKILLED NURSING HOME FACILITIES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. DUE TO THE NUMBER OF FORMS AND DOCUMENTS NEEDED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE TO OPERATE A NURSING HOME. THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP APPROVAL PROCESS MAY TAKE AT LEAST FOUR MONTHS OR LONGER. UNFORTUNATELY CURRENT PRACTICES CONTRIBUTE TO THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN NURSING HOME IN THE STREET. LEAVING RESIDENTS THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE NURSING HOME STAFF VULNERABLE TO ABRUPT CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP IN OPERATIONS. THAT NOT ONLY DISRUPT THE QUALITY OF CARE BUT IT PUTS A STRAIN ON CARE GIVERS WORKING WORKING CONDITIONS. AB A SIXTEEN NINETY FIVE WILL DO THE FOLLOWING THREE THINGS. IT WOULD -- IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT A LICENSEE NOTIFIED THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ALL RESIDENTS AND REPRESENTATIVES NO LATER THAN NINETY DAYS PRIOR TO THE SALE OF TRANSFER. IT WORK -- CLARIFY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTITIES THAT ACT AS MANAGEMENT COMPANIES AND IT WOULD REQUIRE A SIXTY DAY RETENTION. PERIOD OF STAFF WITH NO REDUCTION IN WAGES TO ALLOW THE RESIDENTS TO EXPERIENCE A CONTINUITY OF CARE. AND PREVENT DISRUPTIVE TURNOVERS HERE WE NEED -- TO TESTIFIED TODAY. IS STOSSEL LAMPERT WITH SCO YOU LOCAL TWENTY FIFTEEN AND CORY BOOKER RUBIO CARPOOL. HI A MEMBER OF A CA YOU TWENTY FIFTEEN AND A NURSING HOME WORKER FROM THE RICHMOND AREA. PLEASE THANK YOU I THANK YOU SO THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS RACHEL EFFORT -- AND SO. NURSING HOMES OFTEN USE ARE COMPLEX MANAGEMENT RELATIONSHIPS THAT PARTITION OFFICERS ASPECTS OF OPERATIONS ADMINISTRATION LICENSURE AND OWNERSHIP AND CURRENTLY THERE'S NO -- PRIOR NOTICE OF ANY OF THESE CHANGES REQUIRED TO BE SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OR ANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS OR ANYONE WHO WOULD BE. AFFECTED BY THOSE CHANGES -- THESE LAYERED RELATIONSHIPS INTRODUCED A LAPSE IN OVERSIGHT WITH REGARDS TO WHO IS RUNNING CALIFORNIA SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME -- IN THAT LEAVES SURVEYORS WORKERS RESIDENTS CONSUMER ADVOCATES UNION REPRESENTATIVES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WONDERING. WHO DO WE -- ENFORCE QUALITY STANDARDS WITH -- WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR UPHOLDING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WHICH OUR LAWS WHO WE CHARGE IS RESPONSIBLE RESIDENTS WELL BEING OR THE FAILURE TO ENSURE HIGH QUALITY CARE. ONE OF THE LARGEST NURSING HOME -- OPERATORS IN CALIFORNIA ARE CURRENTLY IS OPERATING -- EIGHTEEN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES -- THAT HE SUBMITTED A CHILD FOR IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THEY'VE BEEN PENDING WITH THE DEPARTMENT EVER SINCE THEN -- THE SAME YEAR THAT HE SUBMITTED THOSE CHAO'S HE ALSO HAD THREE HOMES SUFFERED TERMINATIONS OF THEIR META MEDICARE AND MEDICAL CERTIFICATIONS AS WELL AS LICENSE. SUSPENSIONS FROM THE STATE -- AND HE'S ABLE TO OPERATE THOSE FACILITIES USING THE PRIOR -- OWNERS LICENSE -- THROUGH AND HE'S USING AN INTERIM MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE PRIOR OWNER. ARE CURRENTLY WE ALSO HAVE AWESOME MEMBERS IN FRESNO WHEN -- STOCKTON WHO UNDER THE SAME OWNER -- ARE. SUDDENLY GETTING NOTICED THAT OWNERSHIP IS CHANGING OVER BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHO IS GOING TO BE TAKING OVER THE FACILITY -- NOTICE WAS REALLY SIDE IN THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY REALLY HEARD ABOUT IT WAS BEING TOLD THAT THEIR PAYCHECKS WOULD BOUNCE IF THEY TRIED TO CASH THEM IN SO THEY SHOULD HOLD ON TO THEM AND WAIT. FOR A PAYCHECK THAT COME CAME IN THAT WOULD BE GOOD AND SO THEY ENDED UP GETTING PAID LATE AND THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEIR NEXT PAYCHECKS ARE GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME SORT OF INSTABILITY -- SO WITH THIS BILL WERE ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS A LOT OF KEY PROBLEMS THAT OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING IN TERMS OF INSTABILITY AND JUST THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AROUND. WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN CHANGES OF OWNERSHIP ARE HAPPENING AND SO WE'RE HOPING THAT BY CODIFYING SOME STABILITY AND WHATEVER TRANSITION MAY TAKE PLACE WILL ALLOW -- WORKERS TO PLAN AHEAD HAVE SOME JOB SECURITY -- AND HAVE RESIDENTS BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE CONTINUITY OF CARE AND PLAN AHEAD FOR THEIR FUTURES AS WELL WITH PERMANENT UP TO DATE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THEM REGARDING WHOSE CARE THE RESIDING UNDER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS COREY BUCKLE RUBIO I'M CURRENTLY IS CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANT AT THE NURSING HOME FACILITY LOCATED IN SAN LEANDRO CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN A CNA FOR TREES AND I'M A PROBLEM MEMBER OF S. YEAH YOU LOCAL. TWENTY FIFTEEN I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS FAILING TO PROTECT BOOK RESIDENTS AND NURSING HOME WORKERS WHEN IT FACILITIES BEING SOLD TO A NO THOUGH PRE. TO LAST YEAH WELL THE SEE AN ACTIVE FACILITY IN HAYWARD CALIFORNIA. THAT WINTRY SUDDEN CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP WE BECAME AWARE OF THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP AFTER HE DIED BALL DOWN DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD. SO WE HAVE CUTS OF BETWEEN WHO CARRIES OUT DO YOU DO YOU DO NEW OWNER -- THE OLD OWNER BECAUSE OF THE NEW TERMS AND CONDITIONS THE NEW OWNERS WERE OFFERING. THERE WAS A MASSIVE TURNOVER OF STAFF WHO LEFT THE FACILITY. IT WAS A FIFTY BED FACILITY AND THE NEW OWNERS ARE TRYING TO TURN IT INTO EIGHT SEVEN TWO ONE BED FACILITY. DURING THE TRANSITION I WOULD WALK ON THE NIGHT SHIFT AND BE THE ONLY SEE ANY ON THE FLOOR FOR THE ENTIRE NINE FOR ALL FIFTY BIDS. OF COURSE THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF CARE CANNOT BE GIVEN TO PATIENTS UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE WAS AN AGGRESSIVE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS TO FEEL THE SEVEN TWO ONE BIDS BED THERE WAS NOT A COMMENSURATE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CDNAS ANOTHER STUFF NEEDED. SOME PROVIDING YOU LEVELS OF KID. THIS RESULTED OF CODES IN THIS WELCOME NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE A LEVEL OF QUE WE WANT AND WE KNOW WE A COUPLE OF GIVEN. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOU ON BEHALF OF NURSING HOME WORKERS LIKE ME TO SUPPORT AB SIXTY NINETY FIVE BECAUSE RESIDENTS IN NURSING HOME WORKERS WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS. SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND DESERVE STABILITY AND SMOOTH TRANSITION WHEN A TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OPPOSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER SUPPORT. JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS CLOUDY ACCOUNTS AND I AM A CNA -- DOWN NURSING HOME FACILITY EMPLOYS A COUNTY AND I'M A MEMBER OF A CA YOU. AND I SUPPORT THE SAW. THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE THREE ONE IN OPPOSITION. JENNIFER SNYDER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES -- PERSON LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT -- THE THE INTENT AND MANY OF THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT -- ESSAY YOU IN THE AUTHOR WANT TO PUT FORWARD AND WE'VE EXPRESSED THAT SUPPORT TO THE AUTHOR STAFF AND TO THE SPONSORS -- WE SUPPORT THE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF PUTTING SOME TYPE OF A TRANSPARENCY AND CLARITY OF CRITERIA AND THEN. THE ITEMS THAT THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MAKING SURE THAT -- THAT THERE ARE RETENTION PROVISIONS IN THE BILL A NUMBER OF ITEMS IN THE BILL THAT AND I THINK THE CORE ITEMS OF WHAT I SEE ARE YOU WOULD LIKE AND I AM THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE. OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE AND ART IN THE MIDDLE OF IT A PROCESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IT -- THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PROCESS THAT WE FEEL IS COMPLETELY BROKEN -- THE AND NOW SAYS POINTS OUT THAT RIGHT NOW THE AVERAGE TIME THAT IT TAKES FOR AN OWNER TO CHANGE OWNERSHIPS IS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO DAYS AND THAT'S THE AVERAGE -- IT'S UNSPEAKABLE THAT THAT ARE OWNERS THAT WANT TO TAKE OVER FACILITY THAT ACTUALLY ARE GOOD GOOD OWNERS AND WANT TO DO THAT -- AREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT IN A TIMELY PROCESS AND AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S HONESTLY REALLY. THE LARGEST PROBLEM THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW -- AND SO WEWOULD VERY MUCH LIKE AND WE FED HAVE WE'VE EXPRESSES TO SPONSORS WE EXPRESS IS THE AUTHOR THAT WE VERY MUCH WANT TO WORK WITH THEM. AND TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE SOLVE THIS BROKEN PROCESS WHEN WE HAVE OWNERS THAT ARE WAITING -- UP TO FOUR YEARS I MEAN THE FOLKS JUST TESTIFIED TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE -- ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT'S WAITING THREE YEARS IF IT'S A KNOW IT NEEDS TO BE A NO QUICKLY -- SO THE CURRENT OWNERS CAN FIND ANOTHER PERSON TO TAKE OVER THAT FACILITY -- WE THINK THAT THE PROCESS AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND WE WOULD HOPE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS TO DO THAT -- AS WE ALL KNOW WE WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION WE HAVE A LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM THAT'S THAT'S FRAGILE THAT NEEDS -- THE ABILITY TO CHANGE OWNERS A QUICKLY IF THERE'S A STRUGGLING FACILITY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO STEP IN AND TAKE OVER THOSE FACILITIES. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO ALL WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO FIND A A SOLUTION -- TO REQUIRE CITY PH TO COME UP WIH A GOOD TRANSPARENT A DECISION MAKING PROCESS THAT MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS -- INFORMED AND AVAILABLE TO TAKE OVER OWNERSHIP -- WE NEED IT -- SO WE AT THIS POINT ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BUT AM VERY MUCH HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OFTEN THE SPONSORS ON THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE TO ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- BUT WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON SOME AMENDMENTS WE DO WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH A NOTICE BEING PROVIDED WE THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA BUT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE LENGTH OF TIME. WE ALSO HAVE ONE MORE CONCERNED WITH WE WOULD LIKE TO REYES AND THAT IS WE THINK THE DEFINITION OF MANAGING THE BILL IS BROADER THAN IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE AND I THINK IT WILL IMPACT. SOME OF THE CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS THAT MANY OF OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES -- GO THROUGH TODAY SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ON THE BILL GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. NUMBER BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

OKAY I THINK YOU. AND THEN MISTER RODRIGUEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR KNOWS BILL LONG DAY -- BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL AND ALL OF THE BRIEF THANK YOU. SELECT SIX UP THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HARD WORKING YOU COMMITTEE STAFF. WHICH I IN IN SHORT AB TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE WOULD ESTABLISH OUT REACH TEAMS TASK WITHOUT REACHING FOR THE HOMELESS POPULATION -- WITH A HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS ONE AND AND ABLE TO ACCESS MEDICAL CARE THE BILL WOULD ALSO APPROPRIATE SIXTY EIGHT MILLION IMPROVE SERVICES FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS UNDER CONSERVATIVE -- MISTER CHAIR I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE HAVE WITNESSES WILL ALSO BE BRIEF THANK YOU. HELLO MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S MULLIN WHEN YOU'RE LISTENING HERE TODAY AS A MEMBER OF SEE I YOU LOCAL. SEVEN TO TWENTY ONE I CURRENTLY WORK FOR THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM UNDER LAWRENCE Là FOR LA COUNTY -- DOING OUR REGION DETERMINE AND LINKAGE TO RESOURCES -- FOR INDIVIDUALS FOR SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL. ALMOST HALF OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT I WORK WITH ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND BECAUSE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS -- IN BECAUSE THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE SOMETIMES HARD TO LOCATE I WORK ALONG SIDE -- HOMELESS I REACH PROGRAMS WHO HELP FIND THESE INDIVIDUALS ON THE STREET. THESE HOMELESS ARE REACH PROGRAMS HAVE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION WILL MAKE THE WHICH MAKES IT EASIER FOR THEM. TO TRUST. US ONCE WE ARE INTRODUCED BY THEM. FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE CASE THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS REFERRED TO OUR PROGRAM. IN WAS EXHIBITING PARANOID SYMPTOMS WAS WILLING TO WORK WITH OUR AOTI TEAM AFTER BEING INTRODUCED BY HOMELESS ARE EACH WORKER. WHO HE HAD BEEN WORKING WITH FOR SEVERAL WEEKS? DUE TO THIS ESTABLISHED RAPPORT WITH THE HOMELESS I REACH WORKER THE INDIVIDUAL WAS MORE TRUSTING OF OUR TEAM AND EVENTUALLY ALLOWED US TO HELP HIM WITH GETTING CONNECTED TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. INCLUDING GETTING PLACE IN A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM. IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN OUR CLIENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO GET CONNECTED TO SERVICES VOLUNTARILY WE'VE HAD. TO GO THE PETITION ROUTE AND GET THE MANDATED TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. HOWEVER IF THEY CONTINUE TO TO COMPENSATE AND GET HOSPITALIZED EVENTUALLY END UP GETTING CONSERVE. IN THE FOUR YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THIS PROGRAM I'VE HAD TWO DIFFERENT CLIENTS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSERVED ON TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. ONE OF THESE CLIENTS WHAT'S HOMELESS. GOT CONSERVE AND BECAUSE HE GOT BETTER IN THAT YEAR. THE JUDGE DID NOT RENEW HIS CONSERVATORSHIP HOWEVER SHORTLY AFTER THE CONSERVATORSHIP WAS TERMINATED HE WAS BACK TO LIVING ON THE STREETS AND GETTING WORSE. HE EVENTUALLY GOT REFERRED BACK TO OUR PROGRAM HOSPITALIZED IN CONCERT FOR A SECOND TIME WITHIN LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER HIS FIRST CONSERVATORSHIP HAD BEEN TERMINATED. BECAUSE OF THE WORK I DO I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT BOTH ELEMENTS OF THIS BILL ARE. ONE THE NECESSITY FOR AFFIRMATIVE OUT REACH TO INDIVIDUALS WERE LIVING ON THE STREETS. TO CONNECT THEM WITH SERVICES AND RESOURCES INCLUDING HOUSING. AND TO THE NEED TO SUPPORT THE LEGAL PUBLIC GUARDIAN'S OFFICE SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE THE NECESSARY SERVICES I THE LAR LAS RESORT FOR PUBLIC CONSERVATISM TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE MOST AT RISK AND UNABLE TO HELP. GET HELP VOLUNTARILY. THIS BILL WOULD TARGET OUR REACH TEAMS TO THOSE COUNTIES OF GREATEST NEED AND AND WOULD HAVE TO POPULATION STRUGGLING WITH THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AS WELL AS THAT KNOWLEDGE TO INCREASE IN CASE LOADS. AT THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN'S OFFICE AND MAKE SURE THAT. THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BEING REFERRED FOR CONSERVATORSHIP ARE ADEQUATE. HE SERVED BY THE SYSTEM. I CONTINUE TO SEE FIRSTHAND HOW BOTH ASSERTIVE. OUT REACH AND CONSERVATORSHIP WHEN APPROPRIATE CAN HELP SAVE LIVES BY CONNECTING PEOPLE WITH THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SERVICES. NOT ON MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS [inaudible] UP. SO IT IS IT IS FOR THOSE REASONS THAT THE THE I. YOU IS PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TO BELT OUT OUR STATE'S RESPONSE THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS BY INVESTING MORE. IN HOMELESS OUR REGION PUBLIC GUARDIANS THANK YOU. MICHELLE CABINET WITH A CA YOU CALIFORNIA AND WE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS MISSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

HI GOOD EVENING -- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BRANDON MARCHING WITH CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION -- SPONSORING -- AT AB TWELVE SIXTY EIGHT ON I WANT TO THANK SOME REMEMBER RODRIGUEZ FOR AUTHORING THE BILL AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF -- FOR HELPING OUT WITH THE BILL AS WELL AND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- THE DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED WILL HELP INFORM STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND BEGINNING TO TAKE PLACE. ON A STATE LEVEL TO STREAMLINE THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROCESS. INTO ANY EIGHTEEN AN AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SURVEY FOUND THAT 91% OF PATIENTS WHOSE TREATMENT REQUIRES A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION EXPERIENCE DELAYS AND TREATMENT. AND 20% OF THOSE EXPERIENCED SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS DUE TO THOSE DELAYS. AT NEARLY TWO ACTUALLY MADE THIS BILL IS A NEEDED STEP WHICH WILL ENSURE ANY DECISION MADE TO STREAMLINE THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS DOWN THE LINE IS DATA DRIVEN AND EFFECTIVE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON AB. TWELVE SIXTY EIGHT THANK YOU. OTHERS A SUPPORT I'M SORRY. I'D IMAGINE REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS THE CALIFORNIA RHEUMATOLOGY ALLIANCE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS AND THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY ALL IN SUPPORT. THE KIDS. STEVEN SCHULTZ ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GARY COOPER REPRESENTING CALDERA AND THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF P. A.'S IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RIGHT SPENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. SEE WHAT IT OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NICKEL RESOURCE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS. WHEN WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE SIXTY EIGHT WE DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE? BEING PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS -- IN AN EFFORT TO LIMIT THE BILL BUT REGRETTABLY -- WE STILL MAINTAIN OUR OPPOSE POSITION -- MEMBERS THE THIS BILL IS -- ANOTHER IN A LONG LIST OF NEW ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS ON PLANS IT OF INTERNET USE THIS YEAR AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WILL DO LITTLE TO PROMOTE ACCESS TO COVERAGE OR IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY. ON IT IS A HEALTH PLANS -- MISSION IF YOU WILL TO ENSURE THAT ENROLLEES ARE BEING DELIVERED THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME FROM THE RIGHT PROVIDER. IN A WORLD OF FINITE RESOURCES PREMIUM DOLLARS MUST BE INVESTED ACCORDINGLY. MEDICAL IN UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT TOOLS ARE VITAL TO PROMOTING SAFE EFFECTIVE IN SMART HEALTH CARE OF FOR A PLAN ENROLLEES. NO EXISTING LAW AND PRACTICE DOES PROVIDED BUNDY PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS CURRENTLY -- IN DEVELOPING THESE POLICIES PLANS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS USE THE LATEST DATA IT HEARINGS TO MEDICAL -- BASED EVIDENCE INFORMATION ON SAFETY CONCERNS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHAT SERVICES WILL BE SUBJECT TO AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS AND THE LIKE -- NOT ONLY ARE POLICIES WILL VETTED BASED ON THE LITERATURE IN UPDATED FREQUENTLY PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND MANY OF THE SIMILAR TOOLS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE DIRECTOR FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL. AND THESE ARE TO BE DISCLOSED PROVIDERS ENROLLEES UPON REQUEST. AUTHORIZATION IS ALSO REQUIRED TO BE COMPLETED IN A TIMELY MANNER -- AND PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE FULL GRIEVANCE AN APPEALS RIGHTS -- WHEN A OUR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION -- OR OTHER DETERMINATION -- HE'S HE'S HE'S CHALLENGED -- IN ANALYZING THIS BILL OF US WE ASKED WHETHER THE NEW ADMINISTRATIVE IN PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS REQUIRED UNDER AB TWELVE SIXTY EIGHT ADD ANY VALUE TO THE CURRENT PROCESS. AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE ANSWER'S NO -- THE STORY THAT'S GOING TO BE TOLD BY THIS DATA WILL BE INCONCLUSIVE AT BEST. ON BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CAPTURE THE NATURE OF THE PROCESS AND WILL BE AN ACCURATE. NOR DOES THE BILL CONTAIN ANY LEVEL OF SHARED RESPONSIBILITY ON THE PART OF THE PROVIDER. FIRST THE BILL DOESN'T CAPTURE ANY INFORMATION THAT WOULD INDICATE TO DENY OR DELAY THAT WAS BASED UPON THE PROVIDER FEELING TO PROVIDE THE PLAN WITH THE ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO AUTHORIZE THE CARE. I MEAN FOR MY PLANTS PERSPECTIVE THIS HAPPENS -- DURING THE PROCESS. IN MANY OCCASIONS -- IN ADDITION THERE'S NO ACCOMMODATION FOR THE DELEGATED NATURE OF CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE MODEL. WHERE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT OF THOSE SERVICES -- CAN BE DIRECTLY MANAGED BY PROVIDER GROUPS VIA CONTRACT. THUS A PLAN IS GONNA HAVE TO SURVEY ITS PROVIDER GROUPS FOR THE INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THIS BILL IN THE RATE OF RESPONSE BY THOSE PROVIDERS GONNA DICTATE WHETHER THE HEALTH PLAN CAN. PERFORM AN ACCURATE -- INCOMPLETE SURVEY -- NO HEALTH PLAN DATA REQUESTS ARE NOT PARTICULARLY POPULAR AMONG OUR PROVIDERS IN PROVIDER GROUPS. ON AND PROVIDE A RESPONSIVENESS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM IN PAST EXPERIENCES WHEN ATTEMPTING TO COMPLY WITH REPORTING MANDATES THAT HAVE BEEN -- ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED TO BE COLLECTED RIVER RELATED TO PROVIDER DIRECTORIES -- AND IN RECOGNITION OF THIS PROBLEM PRIOR LEGISLATION RELATED TO PROVIDER DIRECTORIES ALLOWS PLANS TO DELAY PAYMENT TO PROVIDER GROUP. IF THERE IS A FOR FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO COMPLETE THOSE DIRECTORIES. IN THIS BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE THAT -- SHARED RESPONSIBILITY COMPONENTS SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. SEVENTY WATKINS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES I WON'T -- REPEAT WHAT MY COLLEAGUE BROUGHT IT BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT AND THE ANALYSIS DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF KIND OF SPELLING OUT. SOME OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THROUGH A HIP OR NATIONAL TRADE AND THROUGH THE AN AC. TO COME UP WITH A WORK GROUP THERE WORKING WITH PHYSICIANS HOSPITALS PROVIDER GROUPS TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. HOW TO HOW TO BETTER BRING ACCESS AND QUALITY CARE TO INDIVIDUALS AND DO IN A FASTER MORE PRODUCTIVE WAY AND WE THINK THAT THAT MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE VERSES? DOING SOMETHING ON THE STATE LEVEL AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED THE INFORMATION IF YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE RATIONALE FOR WHY SOMETHING WAS DENIED OR MODIFIED YOU'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL SCOPE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN THE PROVIDER SYSTEM. AND UNLESS YOU MAKE SHE'S GONNA DO YOUR CD I IS GOING TO DO THAT REAL HOLISTIC EVALUATION WE THINK THIS IS A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE VALUE BASE TO THE CONSUMER. SO WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS WE THINK WE SHOULD LOOK TO A HIP IS A NATIONAL TRADE AND IS A LEADER IN THIS AREA AS WELL AS AN AC. AND SEE IF WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH. NOT ONLY A STATE BUT A NATIONAL MODEL IN ORDER TO HELP PHYSICIANS AND CONSUMERS AND PLANTS MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO CARE. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEN KNOWN BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. QUESTION BECAUSE I I GUESS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ONE MAKE A COMMENT I THINK I THINK WHAT. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING. YOU KNOW FROM THE SPONSORS. IS IS A FRUSTRATION OVER THE NILES FOR CERTAIN. ABOUT OF AT CERTAIN PROCEDURES AND AND SO -- IN THE ABSENCE OF OF THE DATA IT'S DIFFICULT. TO TO TO BE ABLE TO GET A HANDLE ON ON ON IS THAT A PERVASIVE PROBLEM OR IS AT ANECDOTAL. VOTE BY BY PROVIDER -- AND IF THERE IS A DENIAL OF CARE WHEN THERE SHOULD BE -- SHOULD BE APPROVED -- THEN THEN MAYBE THERE'S A MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PLAN AND THE AND THE PROVIDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO SO I'M KIND OF A BELIEVER. ACTUALLY NOT I'M KIND OF I AM A FIRM BELIEVER IN DATA AND I THINK THAT SO I THINK THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS IS TO TRY TO FIND HIS IS JUST ANECDOTAL OR IS THIS A REAL PROBLEM AND IN THIS AREA AND IF IT IS. HOW DO WE GET THE PARTIES TOGETHER TO GET MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM GETTING CARE? THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED. TO BECAUSE OF THE MISCOMMUNICATION OR OR WHATEVER. SO I UNDERSTAND IT'S I UNDERSTAND. BOTH SIDES OF THIS AND I I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE WORKING WORKING THROUGH. AS WE GO FORWARD ON THIS -- THE BILL DOES ENJOY -- A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. HE DID ACCEPT THE MINUTES SO ARE THE BILL AS A DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS -- MATTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHEN I WHEN I MAYES MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY. AGAR CURRY I BIGELOW.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB FIFTEEN FIFTY TODAY THIS IS A COMMON SENSE BILL THAT WOULD EXTEND THE AMOUNT OF TIME. SOMEONE IN A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS CAN RECEIVE TREATMENT AT A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT INSTEAD OF PREMATURELY CUTTING OFF SERVICE BECAUSE OF AN ARBITRARY TWENTY FOUR HOUR. LIMIT I RESPCTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS. BARBARA JONES FROM TENET HEALTH. GETTING TURN MEMBERS I WILL MAKE THIS BRIEF -- MY NAME IS BARBARA JONES I'M WITH TEN AND HEALTH CARE -- TENANT OWNS AND OPERATES THIRTEEN HOSPITALS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING. A SIXTY SEVEN BAD INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC UNIT -- TEN IT ALSO PROVIDES A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF MEDI CAL -- SERVICES AS WELL AS SERVICES TO THE UNDER INSURED AND UNINSURED. ACROSS THE STATE WERE STRUGGLING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENTS AND CRISES. UNFORTUNATELY THE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS FRACTURED AND THE RIGIDITY OF THE LAW PUTS US IN A POSITION OF TRADING OFF ONE COMPLIANCE ISSUE FOR ANOTHER. OUTPATIENT SERVICES ARE RESTRICTED TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS SO TWENTY FOUR HOURS WILL COME AND GO AND WE ARE WITHOUT A PLACEMENT FOR A PATIENT AND POSSIBLY NOT HAVING RESOLVED THEIR CRISES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED MORE FACILITIES WE NEED MORE TOOLS FOR PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THE STATE AND THAT TAKES TIME AND MONEY. THIS BILL MAY NOT SOLVE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS BUT BY PERMITTING THE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS TO FLEX THEIR TIME BEYOND TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE'RE REMOVING SOME OF THE PRESSURE. AND IMMEDIATELY THAT MIGHT BE THE BEST THAT WE CAN HOPE. FOR WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. IMAGE. OTHERS IN SUPPORT.
