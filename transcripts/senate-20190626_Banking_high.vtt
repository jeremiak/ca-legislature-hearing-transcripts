00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.415
ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA HAS LED

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.250
TO AN EXPLOSION OF HIGH COST

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.885
LOANS OVER THE PAST DECADE.

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:55.054
THESE LONE STAR AT TWENTY FIVE

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:55.955
HUNDRED AND HAVE INTEREST RATES

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:57.857
FROM ONE HUNDRED TO MORE THAN

00:10:57.923 --> 00:10:58.824
2100%.

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:00.192
FAR TOO OFTEN CONSUMERS ARE

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:02.395
UNABLE TO REPAY THESE EXPENSIVE

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:03.529
LOANS.

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:04.864
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS STATES

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.233
THAT 30% OF THE LARGE.

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:09.068
OF A LARGE SAMPLE OF HIGH COST

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:10.836
LOAN FROM LENDERS THAT OPPOSE

THIS BILL WERE RECENT WERE SENT

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:14.440
TO COLLECTIONS.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.574
IN ADDITION TO THE CONSTANT

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:17.109
PRESSURE FROM DEBT COLLECTORS

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:18.577
THIS PROCESS RESULTS IN DAMAGE

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:20.646
CREDIT FROM FOR THE CONSUMER AND

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:22.281
CAN ALSO LEAD TO THEIR PAYCHECK

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:23.449
BEING GARNISHED THEIR BANK

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.885
ACCOUNT BEING CLOSED.

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:27.420
AND THEIR CAR BEING REPOSSESSED.

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:29.188
MORE THAN ONE OUT OF THREE TIMES

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:31.424
THESE LOANS LEAVE PEOPLE WORSE

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.125
OFF THAN WHEN THEY STARTED.

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.894
I CANNOT THINK OF ANOTHER

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.429
PRODUCT THAT FEELS SO OFTEN

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:38.064
WITHOUT GOVERNMENT STEPPING IN

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.565
TO INTERVENE.

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:41.967
HI COST LENDERS WHO OPPOSE THIS

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.035
BILL SAY THAT THEY NEED TO CHOP

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:44.804
CHARGE SUCH HIGH RATES TO MAKE

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.273
UP FOR THE CONSUMERS WHO DEFAULT.

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:49.442
HOWEVER HOW HIGH INTEREST RATES

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:50.943
PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN MAKING

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.711
THESE LOANS AND AFFORDABLE IN

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:54.380
THE FIRST PLACE.

00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:55.781
LET'S WALK THROUGH A COMPARISON.

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:57.983
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE A TWO YEAR

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:58.617
TWENTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN

00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:00.386
WHICH IS FAIRLY CALL IT WHICH IS

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:01.821
A FAIRLY COMMON PRODUCT IN THE

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:02.655
MARKET.

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:04.156
IF THE CONSUMER GET THIS LOAN

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:06.625
FROM A LENDER CHARGING 36% THEIR

00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:07.493
MONTHLY.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.295
PAYMENT WOULD BE ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:10.296
AND FIFTY DOLLARS AND THEY WOULD

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:12.565
PAY BACK A TOTAL OF THIRTY SEVEN

00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:13.599
HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER THE LIFE OF

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:14.600
THE LOAN.

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:16.469
ON THE OTHER HAND IF A CONSUMER

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:18.037
GETS THIS LOAN FROM A HIGH COST

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:19.538
PROVIDER THEIR MONTHLY PAYMENT

00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:21.574
WOULD JUMP TO FOUR HUNDRED AND

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.541
FIFTEEN DOLLARS AND THEY WOULD

00:12:22.608 --> 00:12:25.077
PAY BACK A TOTAL OF NEARLY

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:25.744
ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:27.580
ON THAT TWENTY SIX HUNDRED

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:28.581
DOLLAR LOAN.

00:12:28.647 --> 00:12:30.416
THE OUTCOMES OF THIS UNREGULATED

00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:32.418
SPACE ARE CLEAR.

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:33.619
THE HIGH INTEREST RATES ALLOW

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:35.821
LENDERS REMAIN SUSTAINABLY

00:12:35.888 --> 00:12:37.923
PROFITABLE EVEN WHEN ONE THIRD

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.925
OR MORE OF THEIR BARS ULTIMATELY

00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:41.594
DEFAULT ON THE LOAN.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.229
AB FIVE THIRTY NINE WILL PUT A

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:44.830
STOP TO THIS REGION INCENTIVE

00:12:44.897 --> 00:12:46.432
STRUCTURE.

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:48.200
THE IDEA THAT CONSUMERS WILL NOT

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:49.869
HAVE CREDIT OPTION IF THIS BILL

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.537
PASSES IS NOT REALISTIC THE

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:52.905
LENDERS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:54.140
HAVE FOUND WAYS TO OFFER

00:12:54.206 --> 00:12:55.975
AFFORDABLE CREDIT OPTIONS TO

00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:58.444
BARS WITH DAMAGE CREDIT OR EVEN

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:00.713
NO CREDIT SCORE AT ALL.

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:02.982
AND LET'S BE CLEAR CALIFORNIA IS

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:04.850
AN OUTLINE HERE WE ARE AMONG A

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:06.418
SMALL MINORITY OF STATES THAT DO

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:08.187
NOT CAP INTEREST RATES ON THESE

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:09.989
LOANS. THIRTY EIGHT OTHER STATES

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:12.158
HAVE INTEREST RATE CAPS SIMILAR

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:13.759
TO OR LOWER THAN WHAT THIS BILL

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:15.094
PROPOSES.

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:16.762
I HAVE WORKED HARD TO FIND A

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:18.130
COMPROMISE THAT WOULD EARN THE

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:19.732
SUPPORT FROM BOTH CONSUMER

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:22.902
GROUPS AND LENDERS ALIKE AND AB

YOU KNOW THEY SAID LOOK COST

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:56.013
LIVING YEARS AGO IT IS EXTREMELY

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.781
HIGH RENTS ARE HIGH GAS PRICES

00:41:57.848 --> 00:41:59.383
ARE HIGH.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.517
YOU KNOW THINGS IN GENERAL ARE

00:42:00.584 --> 00:42:03.220
EXPENSIVE AND IT'S OFTEN HARD TO

00:42:03.287 --> 00:42:05.055
TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:07.424
AND IT REALLY CAN BE A STRUGGLE

00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:09.260
PEOPLE DO NEED A NEED A

00:42:09.326 --> 00:42:10.694
MECHANISM TO TO MAKE THINGS MEET

00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:13.230
BUT AS A WE DON'T HAVE AN

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:15.099
UNFETTERED MARKET HERE IN THIS

00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:17.568
COUNTRY AND WE HAVE SOME RULES

00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:18.936
TO PROTECT.

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:20.537
PEOPLE AND AS I GO BACK AND

00:42:20.604 --> 00:42:21.972
FORTH BECAUSE I GOTTA TELL YA I

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:23.841
WENT THROUGH A WAITED THROUGH A

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:26.577
TON OF INFORMATION.

00:42:26.644 --> 00:42:28.379
AND ULTIMATELY WHAT PUSHED ME

00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:30.681
WAS -- AND WHAT CONVINCED ME WAS

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:34.084
THAT -- I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A

00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:35.152
MORAL ISSUE.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.488
AND I ASK MYSELF IS A 2100%

00:42:37.554 --> 00:42:41.859
INTEREST LOAN MORALLY SOUND --

00:42:41.926 --> 00:42:43.627
ONE MY CONSTITUENTS STRUGGLE TO

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:45.496
MAKE ENDS MEET. TO ME THE ANSWER

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:46.697
IS NO.

00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:48.766
AND I'M NOT GONNA PUT THEM UNDER

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.200
THE WEIGHT OF INCREDIBLE DEBT.

00:42:50.267 --> 00:42:51.902
THAT IS NOT PAID OFF COULD

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:53.771
DESTROY THEIR LIVES.

00:42:53.837 --> 00:42:54.838
THE CHALLENGES WHERE DO YOU DRAW

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:55.906
THE LINE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:57.441
LOT OF REASONABLE PEOPLE WHO CAN

00:42:57.508 --> 00:42:58.976
DISAGREE ABOUT WHERE THAT IS

00:42:59.043 --> 00:42:59.843
I'VE HEARD.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.980
YOU KNOW 100% SOME SAY 10%.

00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:06.784
AND I THINK AFTER CONSIDERABLE

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:09.420
YOU KNOW I THOUGHT -- I THINK

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:10.721
YOU MADE THE BEST EFFORT TO

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:13.090
STRIKE THAT BALANCE.

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:15.659
SO DESPITE THE BILL'S MERITS --

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:17.027
THIS IS GONE THIS IS GOING TO BE

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:18.362
A BIG CHANGE IN THE MARKET AND

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:20.764
CURRENTLY THE BILL IS LIMITED.

00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:22.967
TO SHORT TERM LOANS RANGING FROM

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:24.735
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:26.070
990-009-0090.

00:43:26.136 --> 00:43:26.937
NINE AND THERE ARE MANY

00:43:27.004 --> 00:43:28.672
DIFFERENT KINDS OF LOANS ON THE

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:29.573
MARKET.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.676
SO I COULD SEE A DESIRE BY SOME

00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:35.012
TO WANT TO EXPAND THIS TO OTHER

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:37.381
TYPES AND SIZES OF LOANS AND I

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:39.116
AM GOING TO JUST PUT IT OUT

00:43:39.516 --> 00:43:41.618
THERE I'M GOING TO BE.

00:43:41.685 --> 00:43:42.553
THAT.

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:44.488
WE DO NEED TO PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:46.557
SO WOULD YOU COMMIT TO KEEPING

00:43:46.623 --> 00:43:48.993
THIS BILL CONTAINED. TO THE TO

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:50.461
FOCUS ON LOANS THAT WE ARE

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:52.229
DISCUSSING TODAY YES THIS BILL

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:55.132
IS THIS BILL IS REALLY FOCUSED

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:56.600
ON SMALL DOLLAR LANDING I THINK

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:58.102
AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT

00:43:58.168 --> 00:43:58.902
LAST YEAR.

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:00.738
I WAS CARRYING MULTIPLE BILLS IN

00:44:00.804 --> 00:44:03.007
DIFFERENT SPACES -- THAT WERE

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:06.110
OUT NOT JUST IN THE SMALL DOLLAR

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:07.945
250-021-0000 AND THIS DIDN'T THE

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:09.680
INTENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE IF

00:44:09.747 --> 00:44:11.181
I WANTED TO INCLUDE PAYDAY OR

00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:12.716
OTHERS I THINK THAT THAT WOULD

00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:14.218
HAVE BEEN -- IN THERE AND SO

00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:16.186
THIS IS WHAT IT IS I ALSO THINK

00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:19.156
THAT -- IN LIGHT OF ALL YOU KNOW

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:20.958
THIS IS A BIG BILL I THINK EVERY

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:22.493
SINGLE PERSON ON HERE HAS SPENT

00:44:22.559 --> 00:44:24.495
LOTS OF HOURS AND TIME THINKING

00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:27.464
ABOUT THIS BILL -- I ALSO WANT

00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:28.732
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:30.534
EVIDENCE TO BACK UP SOME OF THE

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:31.635
CLAIMS THAT ARE BEING MADE

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:32.669
GOODNESS GRACIOUS I KNOW THAT

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:34.138
I'VE HEARD CLAIMS THAT I DON'T

00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:34.772
EVEN KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING

00:44:34.838 --> 00:44:37.674
FROM -- I I DON'T FEEL THAT.

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:39.076
AS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL THAT

00:44:39.143 --> 00:44:40.511
WE'VE PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT WE

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:42.446
ARE GOING WITH THIS BILL

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:44.181
ANYWHERE ELSE CERTAINLY ANYONE

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:45.516
WHO HAS FOLLOWED MY TRACK RECORD

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:47.384
KNOWS THAT THE OVERALL SPACE OF

00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:49.053
SMALL DOLLAR LENDING IS A SPACE

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:51.722
WHERE I DO WORK -- AND I DO WORK

00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:55.626
IN DIFFERENT AREAS THIS BILL

00:44:55.692 --> 00:44:56.927

00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:08.072
VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND THIS IS

00:45:08.138 --> 00:45:09.440
SOMETHING THAT REALLY DESERVES

00:45:09.506 --> 00:45:12.543
OUR ATTENTION -- I HAVE WORKED

00:45:12.609 --> 00:45:13.911

TRYING TO PROVIDE -- PROGRAMS

THAT PROVIDE ACT -- ACCESS TO

00:45:17.714 --> 00:45:20.217
CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:21.318
IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:22.986
PROPOSITION TO FIND A LOT OF

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:24.755
THESE PRO PROGRAMS LIKE LIKE

WORK TO TRY.

00:45:29.827 --> 00:45:31.161
TO BRIDGE THAT GAP TO MAKE --

00:45:31.228 --> 00:45:32.796
LOANS MARKS BUT ACCESSIBLE

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:34.098
BUSINESS.

NO WE WE KNOW THAT IN OUR STATE

00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:38.335

THAT LOOK FOR LOANS ACTUALLY GET

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:41.171
FUNDED YOU OFF THOUGH.

00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:43.207
PRACTICALLY NOT NEED A LOAN TO

00:45:43.273 --> 00:45:45.242
GET A LOAN IN THE STATE AND THAT

00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:45.809
SET SOMETHING IS BEEN VERY

00:45:45.876 --> 00:45:46.877

A LOT THIS BILL WOULD BASICALLY

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.806
LE ELIMINATE MY ACCESS TO GET --

IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TO TO IGNORE

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:07.684
PEOPLE THAT USE THESE LOANS THAT

00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:11.688
NEED THEM -- AND AND AND LISTEN

00:48:23.467 --> 00:48:24.434
BEEN TRUE.

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:26.670
WHEN WE HAVE THESE KIND OF OF OF

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:27.571

FINANCES I DON'T THINK IT'S THE

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:37.147
GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO DO THAT I

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:38.982
THINK WE SHOULD HELP THEM.

00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:41.752
EN EN -- EDUCATING THEM

PROTECTIONS.

00:48:57.801 --> 00:48:59.770
OF THAT WOULD BE OF OF A FAR

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:00.737
BETTER APPROACH TO MAKE SURE THE

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:02.272
PEOPLE ARE.

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:08.445

ASSEMBLY AND THAT I GOT ON THE

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:23.427
BANKING COMMITTEE AND I LEARNED

00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:25.295
A LOT MORE ABOUT BANKING THEN I

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:26.463
THOUGHT I KNEW.

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.964
I WANT TO SHARE STORY WITH YOU I

00:49:28.031 --> 00:49:28.598
HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:30.000
THAT.

00:49:30.067 --> 00:49:30.767
CUTTING IT ALONE.

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:32.602
EARLY IN MY LIFE.

00:49:32.669 --> 00:49:35.372
AND BUT I KNEW BETTER THAN -- 2%

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:37.007
OR HIGHER LOANS I COULDN'T GET

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:38.508
ALONE I WENT TO THE BANK AND TRY

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:39.843
TO START A BUSINESS.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:42.412
AND SO I'VE BEEN THERE WHERE

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:44.748
THEY'RE AT AND I ACTUALLY WAS

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:45.482
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND A

00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:46.450
PRIVATE.

00:49:46.516 --> 00:49:47.784
PERSON THAT WOULD LOAN ME MONEY

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:49.986
TAKE A RISK ON ME.

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:52.255
AND IT PROVED OUT GOOD AND I

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:54.391
HAVE A GREAT CREDIT RATING NOW.

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:55.025
BECAUSE SOMEBODY TOK A RISK ON

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:57.194
ME SO I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.363
QUESTIONS AYE AYE.

00:49:59.429 --> 00:50:00.230
I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE GOING

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:02.466
I AM VERY ADAMANT AGAINST

00:50:02.532 --> 00:50:03.800
SOMEBODY BEING PREYED UPON

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:05.802
BECAUSE OF THEIR SITUATION.

00:50:05.869 --> 00:50:08.605
I THINK THAT'S WRONG.

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:11.007
BUT ALSO THERE'S RISK THERE'S

00:50:11.074 --> 00:50:12.175
RISK INVOLVED IN.

00:50:12.242 --> 00:50:13.777
WAS WHAT WE HAVE A CREDIT SCORES

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:15.445
BECAUSE THERE'S RISK.

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.180
AND THE HIGHER THE RISKS

00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:17.481
[inaudible]

00:50:17.547 --> 00:50:19.015
THE MORE.

00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:20.283
YOU HAVE TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:21.718
BECAUSE YOU HAVE FAILURES WHEN

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:24.755
YOU DO THAT SO II WANT TO KNOW

00:50:24.821 --> 00:50:27.090
WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT HOW WE GET A

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.225
GAUGE AND HOW WE GONNA.

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:30.327
HOW WE GONNA LOOK FOR THOSE

00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:31.962
PEOPLE THAT DON'T THAT THE?

00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:35.031
SENATOR HUESO WAS TALKING ABOUT

00:50:35.098 --> 00:50:35.832
HOW WE GONNA FIND OUT IF WE LOSE

00:50:35.899 --> 00:50:37.701
HIM AND IS THERE SOME WAY WE CAN

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:41.037
TRACK OR TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF WE

00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:42.572
LOST IN THE AFTER THIS BILL.

00:50:42.639 --> 00:50:45.075
BECOMES LAW BECAUSE FOR ME IF

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:46.810
THEY WE REALLY DO EXCLUDE THOSE

00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:48.011
HIGH RISK PEOPLE NOBODY WILL

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:49.079
TAKE A RISK ON A MAYBE THEY'LL

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:50.580
BE LIKE ME AND I WOULD HAVE THAT

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:52.249
OPPORTUNITY.

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:52.816
I WANT YOU TO ADDRESS THAT

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.384
BECAUSE THAT THAT TO ME IS A

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:57.120
CRITICAL PART OF THIS -- HOW WE

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:59.022
GO FORWARD I I I BELIEVE YOUR

00:50:59.089 --> 00:50:59.923
BILL IS GOING TO BE?

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.992
SIGNED A LAW.

00:51:02.058 --> 00:51:03.693
BUT DOES THAT MEAN THAT IT'S

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.028
DOES THAT MEAN IT'S PERFECT --

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:06.430
RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT WE NEED

00:51:06.496 --> 00:51:08.064
TO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT.

00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:08.999
THE PEOPLE THAT.

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:10.467
ARE IN THOSE SITUATIONS I WANT I

00:51:10.534 --> 00:51:11.668
WANT YOU TO TALK ABOUT THAT

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:13.437
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S AN AND

00:51:13.503 --> 00:51:14.638
ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE THE

00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:16.973
ADD ON PRODUCTS THE INSURANCE.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.342
THOSE ARE THOSE TO ME ARE --

00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:22.112
THEIR WAYS AROUND.

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:23.213
GETTING WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.049
GO TO TO UP THAT LIMIT AND SO --

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:27.884
AND THEY ALSO USE THOSE AS TOOLS

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:29.753
TO GAME THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.988
AS WELL EDUCATED OR OR OR IN

00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:33.190
THAT POSITION WHERE THEY JUST

00:51:33.256 --> 00:51:35.625
HAVE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:37.627
DAY AND SO I WANT YOU.

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:38.228
TO ADDRESS THOSE COUPLE THINGS

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:39.095
FOR ME.

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:41.264
AND I I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:43.567
AND CERTAINLY THE BILL YOU HAVE

00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:45.268
IN FRONT OF YOU IS A COMPROMISE.

00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:47.270
THE BILL THAT IS IN FRONT OF YOU

00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:49.706
IS NOT PERFECT -- AND KNOW WHERE

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:51.308
WE WENT WE SAW THAT THERE WAS

00:51:51.374 --> 00:51:52.976
THREE SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT. ONE

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:53.844
THAT THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.679
ELIMINATED ALTOGETHER WHICH IS

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:56.480
NOT THE BILL YOU HAVE IN FRONT

00:51:56.546 --> 00:51:58.882
OF YOU -- OTHERS THAT DID NOT

00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:00.717
FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE REGULATED

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:02.185
WHATSOEVER IN TERMS OF THE RATE.

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:03.620
AND THEN THIRD THAT THEY FELT

00:52:03.687 --> 00:52:05.188
THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE AND

00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:06.389
THERE'S NOT.

00:52:06.456 --> 00:52:08.525
A MAGIC NUMBER BUT THE WAY WE

00:52:08.592 --> 00:52:11.695
GOT 236% PLUS FEES PLUS

00:52:11.761 --> 00:52:14.331
ANCILLARY PRODUCTS HE IS BECAUSE

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:17.033
WE LOOKED AT WHERE.

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.069
THE DEFAULT RATES WERE AT SINGLE

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:21.171
DIGITS THERE WILL STILL BE

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:22.672
PEOPLE.

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:24.174
WHO WILL DEFAULT?

00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:26.109
BUT WE WANTED TO REDUCE IT FROM

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:28.078
AS THE AS IT WAS STATED IN THE

00:52:28.144 --> 00:52:30.981
ANALYSIS FROM THE NEARLY 40%.

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:32.716
THAT GO INTO COLLECTIONS TO A

00:52:32.782 --> 00:52:33.884
SINGLE DIGIT.

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.619
WE ALSO LOOKED AT WHAT'S BEEN

00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:38.522
DONE IN THE COUNTRY WE KNOW THAT

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:40.490
36% RATE CAME FROM THE MILITARY

00:52:40.557 --> 00:52:42.125
LANDING ACT FOR THEIR HAY HAD

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:44.060
BEEN TRIED AND TESTED WE KNOW

00:52:44.127 --> 00:52:46.363
THE OTHER STATES -- I DON'T KNOW

00:52:46.429 --> 00:52:48.365
THAT EVEN IF WE SPENT THE ENTIRE

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:50.500
CONVERSATION TODAY THAT WE WOULD

00:52:50.567 --> 00:52:52.602
BE ABLE TO FIND THIS MAGIC

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:54.237
NUMBER THAT WOULD SOMEHOW BRING

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:56.540
A COALITION TOGETHER -- BIGGER

00:52:56.606 --> 00:52:58.241
THAN WHAT WE SEE HERE TODAY I

00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:00.076
THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE LOTS

00:53:00.143 --> 00:53:03.813
OF DEBATE WE NEVER CREATED THIS

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:04.648
PRODUCT.

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:07.784
OR THIS BILL WITH THE INTENT OF

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:09.419
HELPING ONE COMPANY OVER THE

00:53:09.486 --> 00:53:11.087
OTHER WE DID A IN THINKING OF

00:53:11.154 --> 00:53:13.223
THE CONSUMERS THE TWO STORIES

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:15.659
THAT WE HAVE -- IN FRONT OF US

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:18.328
FROM IBM MONEY SAYS -- IN A A

00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:19.829
BELIEVE I GOT YOUR NAMES CORRECT

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:21.131
BUT MY YEAH MONEY SACK.

00:53:21.197 --> 00:53:22.499
ARE IMPORTANT STORIES TO

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:24.467
CONSIDER THIS BILL DOES NT

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:27.237
SOLVE FOR THE CONTINUED NEED AT

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:29.372
HISTORICAL NEED THAT WE AS A

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:32.576
LEGISLATURE MUST DO MORE.

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:33.643
MUST DO MORE FOR THE PEOPLE OF

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:35.045
CALIFORNIA FOR THE UNDER

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:36.746
REPRESENTED FOR THE LOW INCOME

00:53:36.813 --> 00:53:38.281
AND FOR THE WORKING CLASS WE

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:39.215
APPROACH THIS FROM THE

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:40.283
PERSPECTIVE THAT.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.385
IF WE REALLY WANT TO DEAL WITH

00:53:42.452 --> 00:53:44.721
WHAT I HEAR.

00:53:44.788 --> 00:53:45.622
ARE EMERGENCIES.

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:47.490
EMERGENCY THAT WORKING CLASS AND

00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:49.392
PEOPLE WHO ALSO WHO COME FROM

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:51.261
LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS HAVE.

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:52.462
THIS IS NOT THE ULTIMATE

00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:54.164
SOLUTION.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:56.132
THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION IS FINDING

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:58.768
WAYS TO GET PEOPLE A GOOD JOB.

00:53:58.835 --> 00:54:00.971
GOOD SALARY PAY MAKE SURE THAT

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:02.706
THEY'RE NOT GOING INTO POVERTY

00:54:02.772 --> 00:54:04.741
THAT IS THE SOLUTION AND WE MUST

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:06.876
INVEST MORE THIS.

00:54:06.943 --> 00:54:08.511
IS DEALING WITH THE FACT THAT

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:10.313
ALMOST 40% OF THE PEOPLE WHO

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.781
TAKE OUT THIS PRODUCTS DON'T

00:54:11.848 --> 00:54:13.783
HAVE THE STORIES.

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.685
THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:16.419
STORIES.

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:17.854
THAT WE HEAR MONEY SEND MONEY AT

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:19.756
THE TALK ABOUT AND THAT'S A

00:54:19.823 --> 00:54:21.558
PROFIT THAT'S A PROBLEM.

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:23.627
CREDIT CARD FOR EXAMPLES THEIR

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:27.497
RATE OF DEFAULT IS 4% I'M SORRY

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:29.532
THEIR RATE DEFAULT YES IS 4%.

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:30.867
AND THIS IS NEARLY TEN TIMES

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:32.902
THAT SO WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:35.271
ABOUT THIS PRODUCT WE STILL ARE

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:37.107
OPEN I AS A MEMBER CONTINUE TO

00:54:37.173 --> 00:54:39.075
HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH ALSO

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:40.777
TRADITIONAL FORMS OF BANKING AND

00:54:40.844 --> 00:54:42.045
NONTRADITIONAL FORMS A BANKING

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:48.051
ABOUT WHAT WE CAN A SINGLE ILL.

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:48.918
IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL

00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:50.387
ASPECTS THIS IS REALLY

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:53.089
ADDRESSING THE ALMOST 40% THAT

00:54:53.156 --> 00:54:54.557
DON'T HAVE THE STREET GOOD

00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:56.559
STORIES THAT COME OUT THAT LOSE

00:54:56.626 --> 00:54:57.794
THEIR CAR THEY GO INTO A DRUG

00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:59.929
DEBT CYCLE THAT GO INTO REALLY.

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:02.832
A WORSE SITUATION THAN WHEN THEY

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:06.836
STARTED -- YOU I WANT YOU TO ME

00:55:06.903 --> 00:55:07.504
FOCUS A LITTLE BIT.

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:10.807
THEY BOTH HAVE JOBS [inaudible]

00:55:10.874 --> 00:55:12.809
N..

00:55:12.876 --> 00:55:14.377
SO I I WANT TO FOCUS ON THOSE

00:55:14.444 --> 00:55:15.011
WHO ARE GONNA BE PRICED OUT OF

00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:15.612
THIS WHERE THEY CAN'T GET IN

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:16.179
THIS MARKET BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:55:16.246 --> 00:55:17.480
GONNA THERE'S A CAP ON THERE'S A

00:55:17.547 --> 00:55:18.515
HIGH RISK WHAT.

00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:21.851
WHAT WERE THEY GO?

00:55:21.918 --> 00:55:24.287
SO IF I MAY UM THE SENATOR DOLLY

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:25.655
YOU AND I BOTH HAVE MADE MANY

00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:27.891
VOTES ON LEGISLATION THAT WAS A

00:55:27.957 --> 00:55:29.225
PERFECT.

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:32.028
AND SO THERE ARE ANSWERS THAT WE

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:33.363
WERE THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.498
DON'T HAVE FULL COMPLETE ANSWERS

00:55:35.565 --> 00:55:37.434
TO WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IS

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.469
CONSUMER PROTECTION AS SENATOR

00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:41.371
HUESO WAS -- POINTING OUT IT IS

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:42.806
SO IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK TOWARD.

00:55:42.872 --> 00:55:44.908
AS FAR AS TRYING TO MAKE SURE

00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:46.810
THAT WE PROVIDE A PRODUCT FOR

00:55:46.876 --> 00:55:48.378
WHICH THE CONSUMER IS SAFE TO

00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:49.913
USE.

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:52.582
AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE --

00:55:52.649 --> 00:55:53.783
FOR THE FOR THE ROOM WITH THE

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.351
REASONS THAT OPPOSITION WOULD

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:58.455
HAVE THE BELIEVE THAT -- ACCESS

00:55:58.521 --> 00:55:59.556
WOULD GO AWAY.

00:55:59.622 --> 00:56:02.292
WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE -- AS

00:56:02.358 --> 00:56:04.360
MANY OR MORE REASONS TO BELIEVE

00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:07.764
THAT -- ACCESS WILL BE GREATER

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:11.034
AND THAT MORE -- MORE LENDERS

00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:13.503
WILL FIND CALIFORNIA -- AS A AS

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.371
A PLACE THAT THEY CAN ENTER INTO

00:56:15.438 --> 00:56:17.073
THE MARKET NOW.

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.175
AND THEY CAN START LENDING -- I

00:56:19.242 --> 00:56:22.612
WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING AND

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:23.880
WILL ANSWER THE QUESTION -- WHEN

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:24.681
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU BROUGHT

00:56:24.748 --> 00:56:25.715
UP INSURANCE AND ANCILLARY

00:56:25.782 --> 00:56:26.950
PRODUCTS?

00:56:27.016 --> 00:56:28.051
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:29.886
ANCILLARY PRODUCTS ON A SMALL

00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:31.387
ALONE UNDER THIS BILL YOU'RE

00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:33.356
TALKING ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL ONE

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:34.724
TO TEN DOLLARS A MONTH.

00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:37.894
IN COMPARISON TO A LOAN OF A

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:40.096
100% OR MORE TRIPLE DIGIT LOAN.

00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:42.165
AND THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATE

00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:43.967
THAT THEY'RE PAYING ONE TO TEN

00:56:44.033 --> 00:56:45.668
DOLLARS A MONTH DOESN'T EVEN

00:56:45.735 --> 00:56:47.303
COME CLOSE OR DROP IN THE BUCKET

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.139
COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT OF

00:56:49.205 --> 00:56:50.573
INTEREST THAT'S BEING PAID BACK.

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.042
AND AS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED 40%

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:55.111
OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:56.679
PAY THAT BACK END UP IN

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:59.582
COLLECTIONS AND ACTUALLY END UP.

00:56:59.649 --> 00:57:01.751
IN A MUCH WORSE SITUATION THAN

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:03.620
WHAT THEY STARTED OUT WITH IN

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:04.220
THE NEED FOR THE MONEY IN THE

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.088
FIRST PLACE.

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:08.691
I GOT INTO THIS BECAUSE AS THE

00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:10.527
SENATOR ALREADY MENTIONED IT IS

00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:12.362
A MORAL ISSUE.

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:14.297
AND THE MORAL ISSUE IS DO WE

00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:16.432
PROTECT OUR FOLKS ARE IN

00:57:16.499 --> 00:57:17.233
CALIFORNIA.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.769
AND DO WE WORK AND THIS IS A

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:21.471
PIECE OF THE WORK.

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:22.906
THE GREATER WORK THE CALIFORNIA

00:57:22.972 --> 00:57:24.841
MUST DO THIS IS JUST A PIECE OF

00:57:24.908 --> 00:57:26.309
AND IT'S NOT THE PANACEA DOESN'T

00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:27.377
FIX EVERYTHING.

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:29.212
AND WE WOULD LOVE TO THE IF WE

00:57:29.279 --> 00:57:30.680
HAD THE RECIPE TO DO THAT WE

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:32.348
JUMP IN AND FIX EVERYTHING.

00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:34.651
BUT THIS IS A START IN THE RIGHT

00:57:34.717 --> 00:57:36.820
DIRECTION TO HELP PEOPLE AND

00:57:36.886 --> 00:57:38.655
HELP CONSUMERS AND PROTECT THEM

00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:40.156
AND I'D I DO BELIEVE IF YOU WANT

00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:41.958
TO GET DEEPER IN THE WEEDS ON

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:43.059
THE INSURANCE AN ABSOLUTE

00:57:43.126 --> 00:57:43.493
PRODUCTS.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.594
WE DO HAVE A WITNESS HERE THEY

00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:46.896
CAN -- ANSWER DEEPER QUESTIONS

00:57:46.963 --> 00:57:48.498
FOR YOU AND I WILL ADD THAT A

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:50.633
MEMBER OF THE SENATE BANKING

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:51.968
COMMITTEE IS ALSO BRINGING

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:53.837
FORWARD SOME CONVERSATIONS THAT

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:55.505
WERE NOT HAVING ABOUT THE ROLE

00:57:55.572 --> 00:57:57.440
OF TECHNOLOGY AND EMPLOYERS

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:59.275
PARTNERING WITH US SO WE ARE

00:57:59.342 --> 00:58:00.810
SEEN A RISE.

00:58:00.877 --> 00:58:02.612
ON THE IN OTHER PRODUCTS THAT

00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:04.113
ARE INCLUDED IN THE MARKET THAT

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.482
DON'T NEARLY HAVE THE RATES --

00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:08.218
CLOSE TO WHAT WERE SEEN THAT ARE

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:09.485
WORKING IN A YOU KNOW IN SOME

00:58:09.552 --> 00:58:11.187
CASES WITH THE EMPLOYERS

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:12.956
THEMSELVES -- AND I THINK THAT

00:58:13.022 --> 00:58:14.657
THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD THAT

00:58:14.724 --> 00:58:16.426
BILL CONVERSATION AND CERTAINLY

00:58:16.492 --> 00:58:17.594
THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT'S

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:18.494
HAPPENING SO THERE ARE NEW

00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:21.431
MARKETS OPENING UP AS WE SPEAK --

00:58:21.497 --> 00:58:26.569
RELATED TO THIS BUT THIS ISN'T

00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:28.738
GONNA SOLVE FOR ALL.

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:29.405
MY LAST VOTE MISTER CHAIRMAN

00:58:29.472 --> 00:58:30.240
THIS IS THE ONE THING I LIKE

00:58:30.306 --> 00:58:31.107
ABOUT THE SENATE WE ACTUALLY GET

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:33.610
TO HAVE SOME DEBATE HERE.

00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:35.545
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN.

00:58:35.612 --> 00:58:38.748
WELCOME TO THE CONVERSATION.

00:58:38.815 --> 00:58:42.151
IT COST ME A LOT EASIER TO TO TO

00:58:42.218 --> 00:58:42.585
BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:44.721
CONVERSATION.

00:58:44.787 --> 00:58:46.422
THE MORE THE THE MORAL ISSUES

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:47.991
THE MORAL ISSUE HERE.

00:58:48.057 --> 00:58:49.225
IS SOMEBODY PRAYED ON SOMEBODY'S

00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:51.294
DOWNTRODDEN THAT'S WRONG.

00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:53.830
BUT IT'S ALSO WRONG TO NOT TAKE

00:58:53.897 --> 00:58:55.531
A CHANCE THAT SEMI HELP TAKE

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:56.232
SOME REST COULD TAKE A CHANCE ON

00:58:56.299 --> 00:58:57.433
SOMEBODY.

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.903
WHO MAYBE HAVE A HIGH RISK SO MY

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:03.006
QUESTION SO I JUST WANT TO ASK?

00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:03.606
FOR BECOME A SUPPORT YOUR BILL

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:04.841
TODAY.

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:06.175
BUT I ALSO AM VERY NERVOUS ABOUT

00:59:06.242 --> 00:59:07.277
THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:08.211
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE OUT THERE

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:09.279
THAT ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

00:59:09.345 --> 00:59:10.580
QUALIFY TO BE THERE BECAUSE THEY

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:11.648
ALWAYS GET TAKE THAT RISK ON A

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:14.017
BECAUSE YOU'VE CAP THAT WRIST.

00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:15.752
SO WE SOMEWHERE HAVE TO FIGURE

00:59:15.818 --> 00:59:17.020
OUT A HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE WE

00:59:17.086 --> 00:59:18.554
GONNA FACT THIS IS THE GOOD

00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:21.257
SENATOR SAID AND AND A ARE WE

00:59:21.324 --> 00:59:22.692
REALLY DOING THE RIGHT THING.

00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:24.027
ARE YOU KNOW.

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:25.261
WE MAY NOT BE MAYBE PUSHING A

00:59:25.328 --> 00:59:26.396
LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THAT.

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:27.864
DIDN'T REALLY DO ART AND THEN

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:29.232
HAVE NO WAY TO REALLY BUILD

00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:31.234
THEIR SELF OUT OF IT SO THAT'S

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:32.635
WHAT I WANT I I I WANT TO HELP

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:33.436
FIGURE THAT OUT I DON'T KNOW

00:59:33.503 --> 00:59:34.804
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:35.872
BUT IT'S A VERY BIG CONCERN TO

00:59:35.939 --> 00:59:37.707
ME AND AND I SAID I I LOOK TO

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:38.741
YOUR BILL THAT I LOOKED AT IT

00:59:38.808 --> 00:59:39.742
WHEN THE SIMPLY AS THE MORAL

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:40.910
ISSUE THE RIGHT THING TO DO

00:59:40.977 --> 00:59:43.713
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK.

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.348
IT'S RIGHT. TO FOR ANYBODY TO

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:46.015
PREY ON ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE OF

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:46.816
THEIR SITUATION.

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:47.684
AND IT HAPPENS EVERYDAY

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.686
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:50.620
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE

00:59:50.687 --> 00:59:51.688
THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAYBE MADE

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:53.189
SOME BAD DECISIONS AND ARE

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:54.757
TRYING TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT

00:59:54.824 --> 00:59:55.858
DIRECTION AND AND HAVE A ARE ARE

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:56.993
DOWN AND OUT THIS TO ME WILL

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.161
TKE A RISK ON HIM.

00:59:58.227 --> 00:59:59.028
AND THAT RISK IS VERY HIGH

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:00.430
SOMETIMES SO WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:01.798
OUT IF HOW ME THOSE WERE LOSING

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:02.365
BY.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.734
TAKING THIS ACTION WE CAN BE

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:05.935
PUSHING THOSE PEOPLE OUT.

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:07.470
AND WE WOULD AGREE THAT WE NEED

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:08.604
TO LOOK AT ALL THE INFORMATION

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:10.340
WE CRAFTED THIS BILL WE DID SO

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:11.607
BY OOKING AT INFORMATION

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:13.376
PRESENTED TO THE DB O. AND WE

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:14.978
WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT --

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:17.780
I A DO YOU KNOW IF.

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:19.315
THERE'S A THINK.

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:20.516
THE OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:21.784
ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION BY FOLKS

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:24.087
THAT DO TAKE A RISK ON MAKING

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:25.955
THESE LOANS ON THERE ARE PEOPLE

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:28.358
THAT ARE COMING IN -- WITH NO

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:30.960
CREDIT AT ALL THAT'S A RISK AND

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:31.594
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:32.161
THEM.

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:33.429
LOANS AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:35.298
PART OF IT ADDITIONALLY IF YOU

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:37.333
WANT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.735
ANCILLARY PRODUCTS I CAN.

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.269
PROVIDE THAT IS WELL I CAN DO

01:00:40.336 --> 01:00:43.673
THAT NOW YOU TELL ME OKAY

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:43.973
[inaudible]

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:51.781
SENATOR ALSO [inaudible]

A PART OF THE LOAN. TWENTY FIVE

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:02.825
HUNDRED FIVE DOLLARS

01:01:02.892 --> 01:01:04.060

CHILDREN.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.999
HE DID NOT REALIZE A LOAN WITH

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:15.038
AN ANNUAL EFFECTIVE. 38%.

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:15.872
HE WAS OBLIGATED TO PAY FOURTEEN

01:01:15.938 --> 01:01:16.539
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:17.607
WELL OVER FIVE TIMES.

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:20.576
THE AMOUNT OF HER ORIGINAL LOAN.

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:23.880
YOU KNOW -- I'D LISTEN TO NOT

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:26.049
ONLY THE TWO WITNESSES HERE

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.250
TODAY.

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:29.752
AND OTHERS I'VE OF SPENT MOST OF

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:32.021
MY LIFE NOT ALL MY LIFE.

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:35.324
IN OF LOW INCOME -- AROUND LOW

01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:37.560
INCOME FAMILIES FROM FARMWORKERS

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:40.296
TO HOTEL WORKERS TO THE JANITORS

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:40.596
[inaudible]

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:44.133
AND WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.035
CONVERSATION.

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:47.804
WHERE THEY'RE BEING TAKEN

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.273
ADVANTAGE OF?

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:52.075
OF ABOUT A WEEK AGO I WAS IN

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:53.876
ANOTHER COMMITTEE.

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:54.944
MEETING IN WHAT COMMITTEE

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:56.579
HEARING WHERE.

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:58.347
WE WERE DEBATING.

01:01:58.414 --> 01:01:59.649
WHETHER OR NOT TO PROVIDE

01:01:59.715 --> 01:02:00.616
PARKING LOTS FOR HOMELESS

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:02.718
STUDENTS.

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:05.288
AND EVERYONE WAS JUST AS

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:07.390
UNCOMFORTABLE.

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:08.624
VOTING FOR IT.

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:10.860
AS THEY WERE.

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:12.061
VOTING AGAINST IT OR STAYING OFF

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:13.763
OF IT.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.565
BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO BE IN A

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:17.633
POSITION.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.036
THIS ACT AS THE OF PROVIDING A

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:20.970
PARKING LOT.

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:22.738
WAS GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:23.906
I MEAN THAT WAS.

01:02:23.973 --> 01:02:25.408
IT WAS A TERRIBLE SITUATION TO

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:26.876
BE IN WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THIS

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:29.378
TODAY.

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:32.915
THE POVERTY IS THE REAL PROBLEM.

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.450
POVERTY IS A REAL PROBLEM WE'RE

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:35.184
JUST TRYING.

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:38.020
TO FIGURE OUT HOW.

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:41.858
TO MAKE IT -- LESS [inaudible]

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:44.026
PAINFUL.

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:45.027
WHEN YOU LIVE IN AND THAT KIND

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.529
OF POVERTY?

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.297
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT.

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:51.334
SOME OF US ARE GRAPPLING WITH I

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.203
REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONCERN.

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:59.876
THAT HAS BEEN -- EXPRESSED --

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.410
FOR FAMILIES NOT BEING ABLE TO

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:03.646
HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL I I THINK

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:05.615
THAT'S THE EVEN WORSE SITUATION.

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:07.383
OF ALL.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.051
BUT TO PREY ON THEM WHEN YOU

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:12.288
KNOW THAT THEIR ON ABLE TO PAY

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:13.789
THOSE AMOUNTS.

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:15.825
I THINK IT'S IT'S EVEN WORSE

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:16.125
[inaudible]

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:21.330
OF THE RISK IS HIGHER.

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:23.566
BUT IMAGINE THE RISK WHEN THE

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.902
PERCENTAGE RATE IS SO HIGH.

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:27.236
WHAT HOW COULD THAT POSSIBLY

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:30.740
MAKE IT AN EASIER RISK?

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:32.375
WHEN THE LENGTH OF THE LOANS IS

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:34.076
AN ISSUE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:38.247
THAT MAKE THIS A RISK EVEN WORSE?

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:38.848
FOR THOSE THAT ARE TAKING THAT

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:43.019
OUT -- HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:44.253
DOLLARS IN INTEREST RATES ARE

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.489
BEING PAID PRIMARILY BY.

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:48.624
PEOPLE OF COLOR.

01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:50.126
PRIMARILY BY PEOPLE OF COLOR

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:50.426
[inaudible]

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.495
SO [inaudible]

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.597
I AM.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.265
I'M HERE TO YOU KNOW EXPRESS ALL

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:58.100
THESE.

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:02.872
BIG CONCERNS BUT SADDENED THAT.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:04.640
POOR PEOPLE ARE BEING TAKEN

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.842
ADVANTAGE OF IN ANOTHER WAY.

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:09.078
AND THAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN SO MUCH

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:10.913
ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES THEIR

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.114
ALREADY POOR.

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.115
THEY ALREADY HAVE THESE

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.483
DISADVANTAGES AND TO TAKE

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.652
ADVANTAGE FURTHER ADVANTAGE IS

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:18.087
EVEN WORSE.

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:20.623
KIND OF REMINDS ME OF THE DEBATE

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:23.859
OVER WHETHER SMUGGLERS WHO BRING.

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:26.162
IMMIGRANTS ACROSS THE BORDER I

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:27.930
DO ENOUGH GOOD [inaudible]

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:30.967
OR NOT.

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:32.301
MAYBE IF YOU ASK SOMEBODY WHO'S

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:34.670
FACING DESPERATION IT'S A GOOD

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:36.105
THING.

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:38.774
THE CHARGING THEM.

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.142
ENORMOUS ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:41.944
MONEY.

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:44.680
TOTALLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THEM.

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:46.415
SO THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN

01:04:46.482 --> 01:04:48.184
HERE NOW.

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:49.518
AND I HOPE THAT AS THE

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.087
LEGISLATURE.

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:53.823
WE CAN DO FAR MORE ABOUT THE

01:04:53.889 --> 01:04:55.825
DESPERATION AND THE POVERTY THAT

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.860
FAMILIES ARE ARE GOING THROUGH --

01:04:57.927 --> 01:05:00.096
SOME.

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:03.466
WE BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL --

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:05.067
AND I'M ALSO SPEAKING AS VICE

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:06.936
CHAIR THE LATINO CAUCUS.

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:09.105
THIS IS A PRIORITY BILL FOR THE

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:10.439
LATINO CAUCUS SO.

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:12.174
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK I

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.810
HAVE JUST ONE QUESTION I THINK

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:17.880
IT'S OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:20.549
SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL -- TO

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:23.286
ADDRESS THE THE ISSUE THAT HAS

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:24.253
BEEN RAISED SEVERAL TIMES.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.855
ABOUT.

01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:29.191
HOW IS IT THAT YOU COULD CHARGE

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:29.492
[inaudible]

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:31.727
MUCH LESS [inaudible]

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:33.362
AND STILL.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:35.464
BE IN BUSINESS.

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:37.233
AND STILL PROVIDE THAT

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:40.836
OPPORTUNITY AND I WILL HAVE --

01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:47.343
AS ROOM.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.978
I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION --

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:51.047
FUNDAMENTALLY WE EACH HAVE.

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.515
A DIFFERENT APPROACH WE HAVE A

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:53.949
VERY DIVERSE SET OF BUSINESS

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:55.184
MODELS THAT WE APPLIED TO THE

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:57.053
LENDING THAT WE DO BUT AGAIN

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.654
FUNDAMENTALLY WE BELIEVE THAT

01:05:58.721 --> 01:05:59.989
RIGOROUS UNDERWRITING

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:01.023
UNDERSTANDING.

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:02.558
NOT JUST A BORROWER SITUATION

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.393
BUT AND THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.028
BUT WE ALSO LOOK AT A VERY

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:08.798
DETAILED BUDGET ON UNDERSTANDING

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:12.168
WHAT IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:13.436
INCOME MATCHES UP WITH THE

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:15.004
COMMITMENTS THEY HAVE MADE.

01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:17.139
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:19.208
DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE FOR THE

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:20.943
UNDERSERVED BORROWERS THAT CAN'T

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:22.812
BE SERVED BY THE TRADITIONAL

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:24.447
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:25.414
IT REALLY COMES DOWN THOSE

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:26.849
QUESTIONS -- THAT'S HOW WE LOOK

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:28.451
BEYOND THE CREDIT SCORE AND

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:29.985
FUNDAMENTALLY I'M WE CAN'T

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:32.688
APPROVE EVERYONE BUT I THINK.

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:34.290
IT LEAST WITHIN THE INSTALLMENT

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:35.991
SPACE -- THE LENDERS THAT ARE

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:37.860
OPPOSING THIS BILL ALSO CANCER

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:39.929
EVERYONE THERE ALSO DECLINED BAR

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:41.764
WAS TOO AND SO YOU LOOK AT THE

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.766
UNIVERSE OF FOLKS WHO WOULD BEEN

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:44.767
DISCUSSING TO GREAT LENGTH THE

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:46.369
FOLKS IT WILL STILL NEED TO BE

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:48.070
TAKEN CARE OF AFTER THIS BILL

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:49.372
COMES AND GOES.

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:51.974
REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME --

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:53.309
THOSE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:55.244
FOLKS THAT WERE ALL DECLINING

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:57.346
THAT NEED ADDITIONAL HELP -- SO

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:58.447
THAT'S PROBABLY RESPONSIVE TO

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:02.284
YOUR QUESTION HAPPEN TO ANSWER

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.587
ANY OTHERS.

01:07:04.653 --> 01:07:05.154
THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU.

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.790
CAN RECOVER YOUR MATCH MISTER

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.692
CHAIR -- LET ME START OFF BY

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:11.994
SAYING THAT -- I PROBABLY SPENT

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:13.562
MORE TIME ON THIS BILL.

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:17.400
IN THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS THEN ON

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:19.535
THE WORK ON MY OWN BILLS -- I'VE

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:21.170
I'VE RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:22.638
LETTERS FOR THE BILL.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.240
AND I BREEZED RECEIVED HUNDREDS

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:25.708
OF LETTERS ME WITHOUT BOXES IN

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:28.677
OUR OFFICE AGAINST AGAINST IT.

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:31.313
AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS MY

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.549
BIGGEST ISSUE IS ACT ACCESS TO

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:34.917
CAPITAL WHICH IS THE UNBANKED

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:37.887
INDIVIDUALS WHICH ARE THE 57% OF

01:07:37.953 --> 01:07:39.722
THE PEOPLE THAT APPLY IN EVERY

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:42.892
AND CAN GET CREDIT -- AND AND IT

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.827
IT'S NOT YOU KNOW SOME OF IT IS

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.762
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LOW INCOME

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.798
BUT SOME OF IT IS JUST -- THAT

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:51.667
WE HAVE A VERY PERVERSE SYSTEM

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.436
OF CREDIT IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:07:53.502 --> 01:07:55.471
I'M YOU GET NO CREDIT IF YOU

01:07:55.538 --> 01:07:56.405
HAVE MONEY IN THE BANK.

01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:57.840
YOU DON'T HAVE A FICUS CARE IF

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.442
YOU HAVE MONEY IN THE BANK.

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:02.211
AND AND SO FOR FOR PEOPLE THAT

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:04.847
ARE USED TO IF YOU DON'T HAVE.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.315
IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY YOU CAN

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:08.617
AFFORD IT -- THEY DON'T HAVE

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:10.186
GOOD CREDIT SCORES AND SO THESE

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:13.789
EMERGENCIES THAT HAPPEN ON AT

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:15.658
HAPPENED AT THE LEAST.

01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:17.827
AT THE LEAST CONVENIENT TIME AND

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:20.162
SO WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:21.564
NO OR LOW FICUS COURTS WE HAVE

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:22.965
INDIVIDUALS WHO LOST THEIR HOME

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.867
DURING THE MORTGAGE DOWNTURN --

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.035
AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET

01:08:26.101 --> 01:08:27.603
THEMSELVES BACK ON THEIR FEET.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:29.271
WE HAVE -- PEOPLE THAT WERE

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:31.941
UNINSURED AND A MEDICAL BILL --

01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:33.275
A BABY BEING BORN IN THE FAMILY

01:08:33.342 --> 01:08:35.811
PUT SOME BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL.

01:08:35.878 --> 01:08:38.948
AND SO -- SO THAT'S BEEN PART OF

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:40.649
PART OF WHY I'VE I'VE REALLY

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.651
BEEN STUDYING THIS IS -- IS THAT

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:45.421
WE DO HAVE A COMPLEX FRAMEWORK.

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:47.690
RIGHT NOW WHERE WHERE IF YOU IF

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:49.525
YOU CHANGE SOMETHING.

01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:51.827
IT HAS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

01:08:51.894 --> 01:08:55.130
DOWN THE ROAD AND SO SO I WANNA

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:56.398
TALK A LITTLE BIT I'M IN I'M IN

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:57.933
A SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.468
I I DON'T.

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:03.506
I IT IS IT IS ONE SOLUTION.

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:05.708
BUT I'M I'M I'M WITH MY

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:08.511
COLLEAGUES HERE -- THERE NEEDS

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:10.145
TO BE MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS AND I

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:11.947
EXPECT THAT WE'LL SEE OTHER

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:14.016
BILLS COME THROUGH THAT PROVIDE.

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:15.718
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO TRY

01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:17.753
SOME DIFFERENT -- PILOT PROJECTS

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:21.090
TAKING THE CAP OFF.

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:23.726
NOT TAKING THE THAT THE TOP THE

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.461
SUNSET DATE OFF THE PILOT

01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:27.196
PROGRAM THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:29.231
WOULD DO WHAT WE DO ONE THING

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:30.132
THAT WOULD BE GOOD AND PROBABLY

01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:32.501
START TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:34.937
FOR LENDING -- THAT THIS BILL

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.606
BUT MOM PROVIDE -- BUT I BUT I

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:40.242
WILL I'D WHAT I'D LIKE IS I LIKE

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:42.111
THE INTEREST RATE CAPS.

01:09:42.177 --> 01:09:43.846
I LIKE THE NO PREPAYMENT PAYMENT

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:45.981
PENALTY THE LENGTH OF THE LOAN

01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:47.850
IS REAL IMPORTANT THE THE

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:48.817
ADMINISTRATIVE P..

01:09:48.884 --> 01:09:50.052
FEES THAT ARE PART OF THE

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:51.353
INTEREST RATE CAP BY I THINK

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:53.055
WORKS REALLY WELL AND THEN THE

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.657
AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED IN

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:58.928
THE IN THE REPORT ON PAGE NINE

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:01.063
AND TEN I I APPRECIATE YOU YOU

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:02.364
TAKING THOSE.

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:03.966
THOSE AMENDMENTS -- WHAT I'M

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:05.434
CONCERNED ABOUT AS AND I

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:07.336
CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:08.804
ACCESS TO CREDIT?

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.239
AND PARTICULARLY IN THE

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:12.341
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND IT'S

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:14.143
INTERESTING BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:15.978
HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:16.579
THE BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:17.379
THAT ARE.

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:19.114
OPPOSED TO THE BILL BECAUSE THEY

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:21.083
FEEL THAT -- THAT THIS IS GOING

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:22.551
TO HURT THEM COMMUNITIES OF

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:24.253
COLOR AND AND WE HAVE OTHER

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.588
ORGANIZATIONS THAT DON'T DON'T

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:26.655
BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:29.558
SO I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:31.527
TO DO IN THAT REGARD -- I'M

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:32.661
CONCERNED ABOUT THE ANSEL THE

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:34.463
ANCILLARY SERVICES -- THEY

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:36.231
INCREASE THE COST OF LOANS --

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:37.299
LIKE CREDIT INSURANCE

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:38.667
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:39.969
PREPAYMENT PENALTY SERVICES

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:41.537
SERVICE FEES THAT ARE NOT

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:42.905
INCLUDED IN THE INTEREST CHARGES

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:45.007
I THINK ALL OF THOSE ARE ARE

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.175
THINGS WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT IT.

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:48.711
AND AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:52.281
THAT REALLY -- ASSISTA

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:52.581
[inaudible]

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:54.717
CONSUMERS. TO TO MAKE GOOD

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.352
CHOICES AND I AND I JUST WANT TO

01:10:56.418 --> 01:10:58.387
SAY THAT ONE OF THE RASONS THIS

01:10:58.454 --> 01:10:58.988
IS PARTICULARLY HARD FOR ME IS

01:10:59.054 --> 01:10:59.355
THAT.

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.423
I'VE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS THAT

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:03.726
HAVE USED -- PAYDAY LENDERS

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:05.995
PRETTY PRETTY REGULARLY.

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:09.965
AND IT'S IT'S IT'S A PERSONAL

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.734
CHOICE IT'S THEIR CHOICE AND

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.535
THEY AND I'VE I'VE TRIED TO HELP

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:16.438
THEM GET CREDIT AND TO DO --

01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:18.841
THINGS AND AND FRANKLY THEY'RE

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:20.676
ADULTS AND THEY IT'S YOU KNOW

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:23.178
LET ME HANDLE MY OWN AFFAIRS AND

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:25.147
AND THIS IS HOW I WANT.

01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:26.482
TO HOW I WANT TO ORGANIZE MY

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:28.250
LIFE AND SO I RESPECT I REALLY

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:29.385
RESPECT THAT IN AND RECOGNIZE

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:32.421
THAT -- THAT.

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:34.390
NOT EVERYBODY SEES THE WORLD THE

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:36.425
SAME AND SO I WANNA -- I JUST

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:37.893
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.261
WHATEVER WE DO IN THIS SPACE IN

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:41.130
CALIFORNIA THAT WERE TRYING THAT

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:42.731
WERE CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:43.632
FOR THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:45.768
TO GET LOANS.

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:47.403
REGARDLESS OF THEIR FINANCIAL

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.872
SITUATION AND THAT THAT THOSE

01:11:49.938 --> 01:11:52.341
LOANS ARE ARE -- IF THEY HAVE

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:54.009
THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:57.446
TO MAKE THE DECISION AND THAT --

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:59.748
THAT THEY IT'S IT'S THEIR CHOICE

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.283
IT'S GOOD GOOD CONSUMER SEXO SO

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:03.352
THERE WAS A PREDICTION. ONE OF

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:04.720
YOUR WITNESSES SAID.

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:06.522
WE WE BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:08.090
HAVE MORE CONSUMER CHOICE WITH

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:09.058
THIS AND I'M.

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:10.693
THAT'S READ THE REASON I'M GOING

01:12:10.759 --> 01:12:12.795

SURE THAT WHATEVER WE'RE DOING.

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:20.135
CREATES A A DIVERSE REGULATED

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:20.869
MARKET.

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:22.905
BECAUSE JUST HAVING ONE OR TWO

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:25.574
PROJECTS DOESN'T GET US TO THEIR

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:26.709

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:28.310

WE NEED -- WE NEED AS MANY

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.315
OPTIONS AS POSSIBLE SO PEOPLE

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:34.583
CAN CAN MAKE CHOICES.

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:35.951

AND AND I EXPECT THAT WE'RE NOT

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:53.035
DONE WITH THE WHOLE TOPIC THAT

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:54.670
THERE WILL BE OTHER THINGS THAT

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:13.055
A START AT A LITTLE LIGHT NOW

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.957
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:16.191
WHY WE'RE ALL.

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:18.927
UP HERE AND WHY THIS ISSUE IS IS

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:20.395
WHAT IT IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IS.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:21.997
IS BECAUSE IT HAS THOSE TWO

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:23.065
SITES.

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:25.234
YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.436
ARE VICTIMS OF PREDATORS WHO.

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:28.570
TAKE LOANS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T

01:13:28.637 --> 01:13:30.239
WHO SPEND.

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:31.807
THEIR LIFE SAVINGS AND END UP.

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:33.542
DEFAULTING.

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:34.143
AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:34.843
NEED THAT [inaudible]

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:37.379
LAST MINUTE.

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:39.715
LOAN TO GET THROUGH THAT WEEK --

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:41.283
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THAT'S

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:42.251
WHERE.

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:43.218
WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DRAW THAT

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:44.653
LINE IS HOW DO YOU PROTECT THE

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:45.654
CONSUMER.

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:47.055
BUT ALSO PROVIDE A SPACE FOR

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:49.024
THAT PERSON WHO DESPERATELY

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.926
NEEDS THAT ONE TIME [inaudible]

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:54.163
CASH -- I CAN'T TELL I MY OWN

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:55.397
SINGLE MOM WHEN I WAS A KID WAS

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:57.833
IN THAT SITUATION ONCE AND HAD.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.535
TO HAD TO GO TO A PLACE IN AND

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:00.903
PAY AN EXORBITANT AMOUNT OF

01:14:00.969 --> 01:14:02.204
INTEREST BUT IT WAS A WEEK WHERE

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.705
SHE NEED.

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:06.842
TO AND SO -- I HAVE A FEELING

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:08.310
OVER THE NEXT MONTH I'M GONNA BE.

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:09.711
HEARING A LOT ABOUT THIS BILL.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:11.580
AS IT MOVES OUT OF THIS

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:12.481
COMMITTEE -- OBVIOUSLY I'M GONNA

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:15.217
SUPPORTED TODAY -- BUT I THINK

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:16.852
THAT'S WHERE THE STRUGGLE IS IS

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:18.453
HOW DO WE PROTECT SOMEBODY.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.022
ON BOTH ENDS OF THIS

01:14:20.088 --> 01:14:20.989
CONVERSATION.

01:14:21.056 --> 01:14:22.624
AND I THINK THIS BILL IS A IS A

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.193
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:25.761
TO DEAL WITH ONE HALF OF THAT

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:27.429
CONVERSATION AS MY COLLEAGUES

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:28.397
HAVE MENTIONED.

01:14:28.463 --> 01:14:29.731
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:31.333
MARKET IS THERE TO PICK UP THE

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.734
OTHER HALF OF THAT CONVERSATION

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.203
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:34.970
WITH THE AUTHORS.

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:36.271
AS THIS BILL PROGRESSES OUT OF

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:37.840
COMMITTEE AND I THINK THIS IS A

01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:39.107
REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:41.543
HAVE TODAY -- FOR ALL SIDES

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:43.078
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:45.848
BOB.

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:47.015
I DO HAVE A QUESTION TAKING

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:48.884
ADVANTAGE AFFECTED THE BILL'S

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:50.586
GOING TO PASS MAYBE.

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:51.420
SOMETHING THAT I WORKED ON IN

01:14:51.486 --> 01:14:53.388
THE PAST OF THE ASKING YOU FEW

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:54.323
WILLING TO ADD SOMETHING YOUR

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:54.990
BILL.

01:14:55.057 --> 01:14:57.359
I I I RUN A BILL TO EXTEND THE

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:59.127
PILOT PROGRAM I TRIED EXTENDED

01:14:59.194 --> 01:15:00.996
PERMANENTLY SINCE WE HAD ALREADY

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:03.131
STUDIED AT AND THAT.

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:06.969
WAS -- SHOT DOWN RECENTLY WITH

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:08.737
ACCESS ACTUALLY INCREASED LIMIT

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.038
BUT THIS WILL REALLY HELP.

01:15:10.105 --> 01:15:11.840
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS TO GET

01:15:11.907 --> 01:15:13.342
THAT PROGRAM MORE AVAILABLE TO

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:15.110
PEOPLE THAT ARE.

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:16.778
IN THIS CATEGORY IN WOULD YOU BE

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:19.548
WILLING TO MEND YOUR BILL. TO TO

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.917
UNDO THAT -- THE SUNSET ON THAT

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:24.119
PROGRAM SO I JUST AT WE HAD A

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:25.621
DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM CENTER

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:27.823
AT CHIANG ABOUT KEEPING MY BILL

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:29.591
FOCUS TO WHERE IT IS AND I HAVE

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:30.692
COMMITTED TO KEEPING MY BILL

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:32.127
FOCUS TO WHERE IT IS.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.462
SO I WILL NOT BE ADDING ANY NEW

01:15:33.528 --> 01:15:37.733
PRODUCTS AND SO I THINK -- IT AS

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:38.767
THE CONVERSATION GOES.

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:42.938
THIS IS GOING THIS THIS IS NOT.

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:44.640
THE END THIS CONVERSATION WILL

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:47.676
CONTINUE -- THAT AND I THINK

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:49.077
THAT THE CONVERSATION RELATED TO

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:51.213
THE PILOT PROGRAMS TO EMERGING

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.715
MARKETS TO NEW MARKETS WILL.

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:56.218
BE PART OF WHAT WE WILL ALL.

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:57.419
YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY AS MEMBERS

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:59.254
OF MAKING COMMITTEES CONTINUE TO

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:01.957
TRY TO DIVE INTO THIS IS THERE

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:04.826
WILL BE OTHER BILLS AT A NO NEXT

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:06.728
YEAR -- BY DIFFERENT AUTHORS BY

01:16:06.795 --> 01:16:07.696
DIFFERENT FOLKS THAT WILL

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:09.331
GENERATE THE CONVERSATION AND

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:10.499
CERTAINLY THE PILOT PROGRAM HAS

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:11.934
BEEN VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.902
PIECE -- AND I AM SUPPORTIVE OF

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:16.571
THE PROGRAM -- THIS BILL AS I'VE

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:18.707
MADE THE COMMITMENT WILL STICK

01:16:18.774 --> 01:16:20.776
TO THIS PRODUCT IN THIS PRODUCT

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:22.044
ONLY OCCUR PRITCHETT.

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.945
THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL

01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:24.479
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY

01:16:24.546 --> 01:16:26.281
COMMITTEE SEEN HEARNG.

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:27.382
NINE I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD MY

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:29.584
VOICE TO THE DISCUSSION AND I

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:31.420
THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM BOTH

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:32.254
SIDES AND IT'S BEEN A

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:34.823
DISPASSIONATE DISCUSSION WHERE

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:35.757
WE ARE TODAY.

01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:38.327
BUT I FEEL WE'RE HERE TODAY NOT

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:41.330
BECAUSE OF PREDATORY LENDING.

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:42.898
I THINK WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:46.134
THERE ARE THREE MILLION UNBANKED.

01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:48.003
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE NOT BEING

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.371
SERVED BY TRADITIONAL

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:51.273
INSTITUTIONS.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:51.974
AND IT'S BEEN A GROWTH OF THIS

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:52.874
MARKET.

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:55.344
AND IT'S BY NEED AND AND AND AND

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:57.579
DESIRE THAT YOU KNOW CONSUMER

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:59.581
DEMAND THAT SOMEONE HAD TO

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:01.984
SERVICES PROP -- THE THE SPACE

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.618
AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN SERVICING AT

01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:05.354
OR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE NUMBER

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.322
PEOPLE WHO ARE UNBANKED.

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:09.124
BUT THE REALITY TO IF THOSE WHO

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:10.158
ARE BANG.

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:13.128
AND THEY NEEDED A LOAN TO DAY OF

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:16.064
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:16.898
THEY COULDN'T GET IT.

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:17.899
THAT'S THE REALITY.

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:19.234
THAT'S THE REALITY OF WHERE WE

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:21.803
ARE TODAY SHOW I TOO AM VERY

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.238
CONCERNED ABOUT ACCESS.

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:26.141
TO CAPITAL I AM CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:29.978
YOU KNOW -- ONE'S ABILITY -- TO

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:31.847
PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES TO MAKE

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:33.715
DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN BUT I

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:36.084
ALSO RESPECTFUL OF THE WORK THAT

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:38.186
THE SIMPLY WOMAN A LOW MOAN ND

01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:40.255
A SOME WOMEN GRATION HAS DONE

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:40.756
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:41.990
CREDIBILITY.

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:43.525
THAT I HAVE MADE A

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:45.694
RECOMMENDATION TO PASS THE BILL

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.262
BUT AGAIN AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:48.830
MY COLLEAGUES.

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:51.099
THIS IS NOT THE PERFECT ANSWER

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:52.601
IT'S FAR FROM IT.

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:54.036
AND WHEN WE ONLY LOOK AT

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:57.472
INTEREST RATES AS A WAY TO SOLVE.

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:58.240
WORKING FOLKS NOT JUST POOR

01:17:58.306 --> 01:18:00.742
FOLKS PROBLEMS WE'RE NOT LOOKING

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:02.377
AT THE THE BIG PICTURE BECAUSE

01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:04.413
IT'S MORE THAN INTEREST RATES

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:05.847
THAT ARE BE.

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:07.816
OF MALL TEAR IT'S AGAIN ACCESS

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:09.484
TO CAPITAL.

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:10.919
THE TO NEED THAT'S NOT BEING

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:12.788
SERVICED BY.

01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:14.089
THE MEMBER AND WHATEVER ENTITY

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:15.590
THAT USED TO PROVIDE IN THIS

01:18:15.657 --> 01:18:17.826
SPACE BUT ALSO WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:19.261
FEES LET'S NOT LET'S LOOK AT IT

01:18:19.327 --> 01:18:20.829
IN THIS MARKET AS WELL WE LET'S

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:22.898
LOOK AT MAKING FEES AS WELL.

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.900
BECAUSE OF YOU BOUNCE A TWENTY

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:26.501
FIVE DOLLAR CHECK.

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:28.236
BECAUSE YOU'RE TWO DOLLARS SHORT.

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:29.905
YOU PAY THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:31.473
THAT TWO DOLLARS SHORTAGE.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.875
THAT'S FOUR DIGITS.

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:36.044
SO LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT

01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:37.379
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN WE

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:38.947
TALK ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:40.882
WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL THE ENDS

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:42.818
AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHY WE HAVE

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:44.319
A LITTLE HESITATION YEAR.

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.388
THE DAY BUT WE KNOW THAT THE

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:48.290
INTENTIONS ARE A WELL I

01:18:48.356 --> 01:18:49.691
APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TWO

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:51.226
AMENDMENTS THAT WE BROUGHT FORTH

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:53.261
BECAUSE IF IT'S ABOUT CONSUMER

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:54.496
PROTECTION CHAU WE SHOULD MAKE

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:57.132
SURE CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED SO.

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:59.167
I WILL STATE THE FIRST.

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:00.735
OF A LOOSE BALL FOR A MOMENT --

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:02.437
THE MEMORY JUST FALLS IT WILL

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:03.738
REQUIRE LENDERS.

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:04.606
SUBJECT TO THIS BILL'S

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:07.142

BUT A MAJOR CREDIT BUREAU.

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:20.722
I WANT TO SEE SUCCESSFUL BARS

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:24.259
REWARDED FOR THEIR EFFORTS WITH

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:25.627
AN INCREASE.

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:26.728
CAN THEIR CREDIT SCORES WHICH

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:28.330
CREDIT CARD ISSUERS AND MORTGAGE

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:30.432
COMPANIES LOOK FOR SO THAT'S OUR

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:32.100
COMMITMENT THERE AS FAR AS

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.668
REPORTING IT WILL REQUIRE

01:19:33.735 --> 01:19:34.269
LENDERS.

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:36.104
SUBJECT TO THIS BILL'S PROVISION

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:56.124
IF IS GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE IT

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:58.894
CAN'T I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.795
MORE TIMELY AND RELEVANT TO A

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:02.464
BAR THAN TAKING OUT. ONE OF

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:04.299
THESE LOANS THEN INFORMATION

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:06.268
ABOUT THE VALUE OF CREDIT SCORE

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:07.736
ITEMS AT IMPACT THEIR CREDIT

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:10.071
SCORES AND HOW THE DISPUTE --

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:14.075
ITEM ON THEIR CREDIT REPORTS SO

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:15.677
THOSE ARE IMPORTANT.

01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:16.478
SO YES WE'RE HERE TODAY AND AS

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:17.145
WE'VE HEARD THERE ARE SOME OTHER

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:17.679
ISSUES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:19.681
ADDRESSED AND I WOULD JUST STATE

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:20.515
BILLS.

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:22.417
YOUR BILL DOESN'T A DOES -- DOES

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:23.885
NOT PROHIBIT LENDERS FROM

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:25.220
SELLING BARS.

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:27.822
ANCILLARY PRODUCTS AS BEEN

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:31.626
ANCILLARY.

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:34.429
ON INSURANCE TO FIT UNDER THE

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:35.830
THIRTY EIGHT POINT FOUR CAP.

01:20:35.897 --> 01:20:37.732
ON AND WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:39.100
NEEDS OF BORROWERS WHO WANT TO

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:41.436
BORROW LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:42.270
HUNDRED BECAUSE ALSO I'VE HAD

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:44.172
PLENTY FOLKS WHO'VE COME INTO MY

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:44.806
OFFICE.

01:20:44.873 --> 01:20:46.441
AND SAID I NEEDED A THOUSAND

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.843
DOLLARS BUT BECAUSE OF THIS FOR

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:50.979
START TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED I

01:20:51.046 --> 01:20:52.013
BORROW TWENTY FIVE ARGUED I'D

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:52.914
MEASLY PAY BACK.

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:57.552
THE FIFTEEN AND I KERRY THE

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:59.321
BALANCE ON THE ONE THOUSAND WHAT

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:00.121
LET'S LOOK AT WARNER FLOOR TO I

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:01.957
MEAN BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:03.058
GREATEST.

01:21:03.124 --> 01:21:03.925
HOLE IS THAT'S WHERE THE

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:05.460
MAJORITY OF BORROWS THEY NEED

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:07.963
ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:08.597
FIFTEEN HUNDRED MAJORITY OF OF

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:09.531
COMING OF MY OFFICES I DON'T

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:11.233
NEED TWENTY FIVE WHEN YOU BUT I

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:12.167
TAKE IT IN ORDER.

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:12.934
TO BECAUSE I CAN'T GET ANYTHING

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:13.602
ELSE.

01:21:13.668 --> 01:21:16.071
ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:17.272
FIVE HUNDRED SO WE HAVE TO

01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:18.707
ADDRESS THAT SPACES WHILE.

01:21:18.773 --> 01:21:20.008
I MEAN AND THAT'S THAT'S REAL

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:23.511
AND AND AGAIN.

01:21:23.578 --> 01:21:26.214
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AGAIN TALKING

01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:29.050
TO ALL INSTITUTIONS OF LENDING

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:29.618
AND GETTING EVERYBODY AT THE

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:31.253
TABLE.

01:21:31.319 --> 01:21:33.455
BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE THREE

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:36.124
MILLION PLUS CALIFORNIANS WITH

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:37.359
NO ACCESS.

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:39.094
TO TRADITIONAL BANKING OR CREDIT

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.729
OR WHEN IT WORK WHATEVER THAT

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:41.296
MIGHT BE.

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:44.599
NOW WE MUST DO A BETTER JOB ON

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:46.968
AT ADDRESSING THOSE.

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:49.137
REAL HARD REALITY SO.

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:50.739
THAT'S WHERE I AM WITH THAT --

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:52.173
YOU ACCEPTED THE THOSE TWO

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.842
MOMENTS THAT WE'VE DESCRIBED AND

01:21:53.908 --> 01:21:55.443
I HOPE YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:58.546
THAT AGAIN -- AS HIS BOWL BILL

01:21:58.613 --> 01:22:00.482
MOST FOR THAT.

01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:01.883
THERE WILL NOT BE ANY ADDITIONAL

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:03.718
ADD ONS THAT.

01:22:03.785 --> 01:22:05.053
HAVEN'T BEEN AGREED UPON ON THIS --

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.821
BY THIS COMMITTEE OF SO WE

01:22:06.888 --> 01:22:08.657
RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BRING IT

01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:10.792
BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE AND DEAL

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:12.494
WITH IT ACCORDINGLY SO.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.562
THAT OUR UNDERSTANDING I THINK A

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:15.730
REPEATED IT A FEW TIMES YEAH.

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:18.099
I JUST I APPRECIATED BUT WE JUST

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:21.803
LIKE TO BE CLEAR SO -- AGAIN --

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:23.838
OKAY I APPRECIATED SO WOULD YOU

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:25.607

ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MOAN.

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:31.713
I WANTED TO STATE JUST REITERATE

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:34.049
ONCE MORE THAT -- THIS BILL WAS

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:36.151
NEVER PROMOTED OR BROUGHT

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:39.020
FORWARD AS THE FIX ALL TO THE TO

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:40.588
THE LENDING ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:43.325
FACING -- NATIONALLY AND AND

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:44.659
ALSO IN OUR STATE OF THE STATE

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:46.227
OF CALIFORNIA I THINK WHAT WE

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.128
FOR TODAY.

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:48.963
OUR CONCERNS FROM SENATORS

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:50.432
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:52.901
OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT HAVE --

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:54.869
THAT EXPRESS YOUR CONCERNS IN

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:56.971
SUCH A WAY THAT IS HOPE MANY OF

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:58.773
US TO LEARN THAT THERE THOSE

01:22:58.840 --> 01:22:59.841
CONCERNS CAN TURN INTO GREAT

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:02.143
IDEAS FOR ADDITIONAL BILLS.

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:04.879
THAT -- TURN INTO A SERIES OF

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:06.681
BILLS THAT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM

01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:09.050
HOLISTICALLY AND WHAT WE HAVE

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:10.852
DONE WAS WE'VE PICKED A NICHE.

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:13.154
AN AREA THAT WE CAN START WITH

01:23:13.221 --> 01:23:14.489
THAT OTHERS CAN LEARN HOW TO

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:16.424
MOVE OTHER IDEAS THROUGH AND

01:23:16.491 --> 01:23:17.492
OTHER IDEAS FORWARD.

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:19.160
MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:21.596
YOU AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF --

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:25.033
FOR IN PARTICULAR ONE OF THE

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:25.533
AMENDMENTS.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:28.336
THAT -- REALLY I BELIEVE WILL BE

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:30.438
VERY VERY HELPFUL AND UPWARD

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:32.874
MOBILITY AND HELPING PEOPLE TO

01:23:32.941 --> 01:23:35.076
GRADUATE FROM SUB PRIME IT TO

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:35.777
PRIME.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.812
AND YOU WE TALK ABOUT ACCESS ONE

01:23:37.879 --> 01:23:39.581
OF THE GREATEST AREAS OR WAYS TO

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:41.449
CREATE ACCESS IS TO MAKE SURE WE

01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:44.052
DON'T CREATE A POOL OF SUBPRIME

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:45.420
WHERE SOMEONE STAYS THERE.

01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:46.755
BUT THE IT BECOMES THE

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:48.757
OPPORTUNITY IN A STEPPING STONE

01:23:48.823 --> 01:23:50.959
TO GO FROM SUB PRIME TO PRIME

01:23:51.025 --> 01:23:52.761
CREATING THAT OPEN SPOT FOR

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:54.696
OTHERS TO MOVE IN SO WITH THAT

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.831
AMENDMENT I THINK THAT'S PART OF

01:23:56.898 --> 01:23:58.833
ANOTHER -- ANSWER AND THE

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:00.602
SOLUTION TO A BIGGER PROBLEM

01:24:00.668 --> 01:24:01.736
THAT ALL OF US WANT TO SEE

01:24:01.803 --> 01:24:03.138
EVENTUALLY RESOLVED THAT CAN'T

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:09.611
BE DONE WITH ONE SINGLE BILL SO

01:24:09.677 --> 01:24:10.478
THANK YOU FOR THAT AND CLOSE EXT.

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:12.414

COMMITTEE STAFF AND ALL THE

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:14.816
MEMBERS MANY OF YOU HAVE SAID

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:16.217
THAT YOU'VE NOT BEEN LOBBIED.

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:19.053
ON A BILL AS MUCH AS THIS BILL --

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.822
AND YOU SAID WHETHER IT WAS YOUR

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:21.823
OWN WITH YOUR TEN YEARS

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:24.392
EXPERIENCE THIS BILL IS

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:26.127
CERTAINLY MOVING THE NEEDLE AND

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:28.062
IT'S HARD IT HAS EQUALLY BEEN

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:30.732
HARD FOR ME AS THE AUTHOR -- IN

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:33.101
THIS IS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:36.571
ISSUE AND THE NO WAY ALL OF THE

01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:37.739
THINGS THAT WERE TAKING NEEDED

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:39.541
TODAY THAT ARE ISSUES THAT WE

01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:41.543
CONTINUE TO NEED TO WORK ON THE

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:42.644
EN BANC.

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:44.379
ACCESS TO CAPITAL BOTH IN

01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:45.880
TRADITIONAL AND NONTRADITIONAL

01:24:45.947 --> 01:24:48.883
FORMS FINANCIAL LITERACY AXIS

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:51.052
TOOK A BUILDING CREDIT -- THE

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:53.354
EMERGING MARKETS ALL OF THOSE

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:54.589
ARE PART OF A GREATER

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:56.958
CONVERSATION THIS BILL FROM THE

01:24:57.025 --> 01:25:00.562
BEGINNING WAS ABOUT A RATE CAP.

01:25:00.628 --> 01:25:01.095
AND WE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:02.397
WOULDN'T ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:04.766
BUT I HOPE THAT AS IN THESE THIS

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.968
CONVERSATION HAS COME FORWARD AS

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:07.702
EVERYONE.

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:09.404
AND HAS IN IN SOMEWHERE OTHER

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:11.005
EXPRESSED THAT THERE IS MORE TO

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:12.707
DO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:14.108
THESE CONVERSATIONS IN THE

01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:15.910
COMING YEARS ABOUT WHAT WE DO TO

01:25:15.977 --> 01:25:17.345
ADDRESS THE OTHER ELEMENTS.

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:18.680
THAT ARE PART OF A BIGGER

01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:20.782
CONVERSATION -- I THINK THAT

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:23.017
THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR ME IT

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:25.720
WAS NEVER ABOUT EIGHTEEN ONE

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:27.222
SIDE OR THE OTHER IT WAS TRYING

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:30.158
TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE ADDRESS THE

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:31.459
FACT THAT TWENTY THOUSAND

01:25:31.526 --> 01:25:33.294
CALIFORNIANS LOSE THEIR CAR A

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:35.196
YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS PRODUCT.

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:37.131
THAT NEARLY 40% GO INTO

01:25:37.198 --> 01:25:38.666
COLLECTIONS BECAUSE OF THIS

01:25:38.733 --> 01:25:40.702
PRODUCT -- THAT IS WHERE WE

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:43.438
TRIED TO GO WITH THIS BILL AND

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:45.406
WE UNDERSTOOD THAT FOR US FOR

01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:47.075
THIS PERSPECTIVE WE NEEDED A

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:48.009
RATE CAPS.

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:49.777
GETTING TO THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN

01:25:49.844 --> 01:25:51.980
UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT LOTS HAS

01:25:52.046 --> 01:25:53.882
BEEN PROPOSED -- AND SO I THINK

01:25:53.948 --> 01:25:55.650
WHEN I HEAR FOLKS THAT SAY WELL

01:25:55.717 --> 01:25:57.151
WE WERE INVITED TO THE TABLE

01:25:57.218 --> 01:25:58.987
EVERYBODY WAS INVITED TO THE

01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:00.188
TABLE BUT IT WAS A RATE CAPS

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:02.090
BILL AND IF YOU WEREN'T WILLING

01:26:02.156 --> 01:26:03.725
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT A

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:04.025
RATE CAPS.

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:05.927
THEN YOU'RE RIGHT PEOPLE CHOSE

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:07.529
NOT TO BE AT THE TABLE -- THIS

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:09.597
BILL WASN'T ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:10.665
AND I THINK.
