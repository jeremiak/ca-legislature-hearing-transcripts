00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:35.362 region:rollup2
VETERANS BY MARRYING THE HEALING

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:36.163 region:rollup2
POWER OF THE ARTS.

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:38.498 region:rollup2
WITH THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:39.566 region:rollup2
REALLY SERVED OUR COUNTRY.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:41.268 region:rollup2
IN A FEW QUESTIONS AND OF COURSE

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:43.303 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE THAT HERE

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:45.939 region:rollup2

THIS HEARING ARE GETTING US TO

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:58.085 region:rollup2

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:01.188 region:rollup2
WHAT EXACTLY DOES IT MEAN TO BE

HEALED?

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:03.957 region:rollup2
I THINK WE WANT TO USE THE TERM

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:05.626 region:rollup2
SHIELD WE MUST USE IT

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.259 region:rollup2

HOW THEY SURVIVE SUCH TRAUMA

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.739 region:rollup2
HOWEVER HEALING IS A JOURNEY OF

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:19.272 region:rollup2

00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:30.817 region:rollup2
CONNECT WITH ALL OF THESE

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:32.619 region:rollup2
VETERANS. RIGHT WHEN THEY ARE

00:12:30.817 --> 00:12:34.020 region:rollup2
SEPARATING FOR SERVICE AND TO

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:35.555 region:rollup2

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.582 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY VETERANS.

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:12.318 region:rollup2
WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM THE

THE BASIS THAT THE ARTS ARE

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:39.065 region:rollup2
CENTRAL TO THE LIVES OF ALL

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:41.234 region:rollup2

THAT.

00:25:42.074 --> 00:25:44.643 region:rollup2
.

00:25:43.242 --> 00:25:46.245 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IT IT COMES OUT OF

00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:47.112 region:rollup2
THE IDEA THAT THERE REALLY IS NO

00:25:46.245 --> 00:25:49.281 region:rollup2
CONNECTION BETWEEN ARTS AND AND

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:50.182 region:rollup2
AND THE MILITARY.

00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:51.450 region:rollup2
SO MAYBE TO MY.

00:25:50.182 --> 00:25:53.118 region:rollup2
COMES TODAY ELECTED MAYBE

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.353 region:rollup2
DISPEL THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:56.355 region:rollup2
ALSO SHARE WHERE I THINK IT'S A

00:25:54.353 --> 00:25:56.955 region:rollup2
LOT IS NOT TRUE THE WHERE

00:25:56.355 --> 00:25:57.890 region:rollup2
THERE'S A GREATER OPPORTUNITY

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:58.857 region:rollup2
FOR THAT.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.193 region:rollup2
BUT AS STATED.

00:25:58.857 --> 00:26:02.861 region:rollup2
MONEY WAS NO LIVE INSIDE SPENT

00:26:01.193 --> 00:26:03.796 region:rollup2
THIRTY TWO YEARS ON ACTIVE DUTY.

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:04.930 region:rollup2
AND I COME TO IS COME TO SUCH A

00:26:03.796 --> 00:26:06.432 region:rollup2
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW I

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.367 region:rollup2
TRANSITION WHEN I ACTUALLY CAME

00:26:06.432 --> 00:26:09.802 region:rollup2
INTO MILITARY ACTIVITY MILITARY

00:26:08.367 --> 00:26:11.570 region:rollup2
AT THE POST VIETNAM TIME.

00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:13.005 region:rollup2
AT ODOS THIRTY YEARS I'VE HAD

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.773 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE.

00:26:13.005 --> 00:26:15.507 region:rollup2
DRASTIC CHANGE IN THE

00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:17.342 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:18.844 region:rollup2
MILITARY AND THE COMMUNITY IN

00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:20.579 region:rollup2
GENERAL BUT ALSO HEARTS I THINK

00:26:18.844 --> 00:26:22.181 region:rollup2
IN SPECIFIC.

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:24.149 region:rollup2
SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS.

00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:25.551 region:rollup2
FRAME MY COMMENTS ARE OWNED ON

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:26.785 region:rollup2
THESE OCCASIONS MOSTLY AROUND

00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:28.454 region:rollup2
THE IDEA OF THIS BEING A

00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:29.455 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY DISCUSSION.

00:26:28.454 --> 00:26:31.023 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON I DO THAT IS

00:26:29.455 --> 00:26:32.224 region:rollup2
BECAUSE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES

00:26:31.023 --> 00:26:34.026 region:rollup2
AROUND OUR MILITARY BASES ARE

00:26:32.224 --> 00:26:35.327 region:rollup2
TRULY THE HOMES.

00:26:34.026 --> 00:26:36.261 region:rollup2
OF OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR

00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:37.729 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AS YOU PERHAPS KNOW

00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:38.931 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT.

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:40.165 region:rollup2
A MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS LIVE

00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:42.067 region:rollup2
IN THE ACTUAL COMMUNITY DO NOT

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:43.168 region:rollup2
LIVE ON THE BASIS.

00:26:42.067 --> 00:26:44.603 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT POINT

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:45.704 region:rollup2
AND WE ESTABLISHES NOTION OF

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:47.906 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITY

00:26:45.704 --> 00:26:49.374 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:50.309 region:rollup2
WHAT HERE'S OF REAL BOTTOM LINE

00:26:49.374 --> 00:26:51.543 region:rollup2
I THINK I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH

00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:52.578 region:rollup2
YOU TODAY AS I BELIEVE THE ARTS

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:54.646 region:rollup2
IN THE MILITARY COMMUNITY HAS A

00:26:52.578 --> 00:26:56.215 region:rollup2
GREAT OPPORTUNITY?

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:58.584 region:rollup2
TO SERVE EACH OTHER AND ARE AS

00:26:56.215 --> 00:26:59.485 region:rollup2
NEVER BEFORE AND EVEN GROW

00:26:58.584 --> 00:27:01.286 region:rollup2
STRONGER ARTS IN MILITARY

00:26:59.485 --> 00:27:02.387 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:04.089 region:rollup2
THAT'S MY PASSION AND EVEN

00:27:02.387 --> 00:27:04.656 region:rollup2
STRONGER ARTS IN MILITARY

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:06.492 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IN SERVICE TO EACH

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:08.594 region:rollup2
OTHER.

00:27:06.492 --> 00:27:09.862 region:rollup2
NOW IN I I LIKE TO OPEN DE THE

00:27:08.594 --> 00:27:11.663 region:rollup2
COMETS WITH THE LITTLE

00:27:09.862 --> 00:27:13.532 region:rollup2
PORTRAYING A PROBABLE DISPOSED

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:15.067 region:rollup2
TO YOU MY BIAS FOR THE ART BUT

00:27:13.532 --> 00:27:18.403 region:rollup2
BUT I DO IT IN ORDER TO CREATE A

00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:20.139 region:rollup2
METAPHOR. FOR MY DISCUSSION.

00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:21.039 region:rollup2
TWO ROADS DIVERGED IN A WOOD.

00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:23.075 region:rollup2
AND I TOOK THE ONE LESS TRAVELED

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:23.609 region:rollup2
BY.

00:27:23.075 --> 00:27:25.477 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAS MADE ALL THE

00:27:23.609 --> 00:27:26.945 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE. THESE ARE THE WORDS

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:28.747 region:rollup2
BY ROBERT FROST WE ALL REALLY

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:30.249 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE.

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:31.783 region:rollup2
BUT I'LL FOR SLIGHT TWIST ON

00:27:30.249 --> 00:27:33.151 region:rollup2
THESE WORDS TO CREATE A METAPHOR

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:35.020 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING BETWEEN

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:36.321 region:rollup2
ARTS IN MILITARY COMMUNITY.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.823 region:rollup2
WELL ALL COULD LOCAL COMMUNITIES

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:39.324 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:40.325 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF DIVERGING I THINK THE

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:41.894 region:rollup2
ROADS OF THE ARTS IN THE

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:43.829 region:rollup2
MILITARY COMMUNITIES OF

00:27:41.894 --> 00:27:45.063 region:rollup2
CONVERGING THE TOWEL COMMUNITY.

00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:47.166 region:rollup2
AND IF THE ARTS AND MILITARY

00:27:45.063 --> 00:27:49.201 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY SEIZE THIS MOMENT WE

00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:50.536 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:52.037 region:rollup2
IT'S A TOPIC THAT MANY OF US

00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:52.938 region:rollup2
UPON HEARING MY CONSIDERATION

00:27:52.037 --> 00:27:54.540 region:rollup2
VERY ON RELATED AS I STATED

00:27:52.938 --> 00:27:55.841 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.342 region:rollup2
BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS

00:27:55.841 --> 00:27:59.578 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S BEEN A LONG HISTORY

00:27:57.342 --> 00:28:00.646 region:rollup2
BETWEEN ARTS AND MILITARY.

00:27:59.578 --> 00:28:01.947 region:rollup2
THE LONG WINTER OF SEVENTEEN

00:28:00.646 --> 00:28:03.482 region:rollup2
SEVENTY SEVEN IN SEVENTEEN

00:28:01.947 --> 00:28:05.184 region:rollup2
SEVENTY EIGHT. WHEN THE COULD

00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:06.785 region:rollup2

00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:09.688 region:rollup2
INTERRUPTED BY A PRESENTATION OF

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:11.156 region:rollup2
THE PLAY KATO.

00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:13.525 region:rollup2
COMMISSION BY GEORGE WASHINGTON

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:15.060 region:rollup2
HIMSELF FOR THE TROOPS.

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:17.095 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S THE GRAY GHOST ARMY

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.197 region:rollup2
OF WORLD WAR TWO.

00:28:17.095 --> 00:28:20.732 region:rollup2
A FACT OF MILITARY SECRECY UNTIL

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:22.467 region:rollup2
IT'S DARK DECLASSIFICATION IN

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:24.102 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX.

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:25.704 region:rollup2

AN ELITE FORCE WHOSE SPECIALTY

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:31.843 region:rollup2
WAS TACTICAL DECEPTION.

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:34.279 region:rollup2
KNOWN AS THE GHOST ARMY A TROUPE

00:28:31.843 --> 00:28:35.914 region:rollup2

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:37.783 region:rollup2
THEATER AS A TROUPE OF ACTORS.

00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:39.585 region:rollup2
THEY CREATED INFLATABLE TANKS TO

00:28:37.783 --> 00:28:40.986 region:rollup2
DECEIVE GERMAN MILITARY. IT IT

00:28:39.585 --> 00:28:42.454 region:rollup2
TOO IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE

00:28:40.986 --> 00:28:44.256 region:rollup2
ALLIES EMBRACED HIS ARTISTRY OF

00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:45.524 region:rollup2
THE ART.

00:28:44.256 --> 00:28:46.992 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'RE NOW AT A MOMENT

00:28:45.524 --> 00:28:49.094 region:rollup2
WHERE THE TWO COMMUNITIES CAN

00:28:46.992 --> 00:28:51.964 region:rollup2
AGAIN SERVE EACH OTHER. ALBEIT

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:53.699 region:rollup2
THIS TIME ON THE HOME FRONT.

00:28:51.964 --> 00:28:54.733 region:rollup2
THE OPERATIVE QUESTION ONE MIGHT

00:28:53.699 --> 00:28:56.101 region:rollup2
ASK IS HOW DO WE GET TO THIS

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:58.070 region:rollup2
POINT HOW DID ARTS IN THE

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:59.371 region:rollup2
MILITARY. GET TO A POINT WHERE

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:01.240 region:rollup2
THEY CAN FIND VALUE IN SERVICE

00:28:59.371 --> 00:29:02.741 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.742 region:rollup2
LET'S DEAL WITH THE FIRST ONE

00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:05.744 region:rollup2
WHAT BRINGS A MILITARY SERVICE

00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:07.145 region:rollup2
POINT OF CONVERGENCE.

00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:07.846 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S A TREMENDOUS SET OF

00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:09.748 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND DEMANDS BEFORE

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:11.049 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:12.551 region:rollup2
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE MORE

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:14.353 region:rollup2
THAN TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION US

00:29:12.551 --> 00:29:15.520 region:rollup2
TROOPS HAVE DEPLOYED.

00:29:14.353 --> 00:29:16.655 region:rollup2
THEY'VE SEEN A HISTORIC AN

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.523 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF MULTIPLE

00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:20.058 region:rollup2
DEPLOYMENTS.

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:22.961 region:rollup2
THEY'VE EXPERIENCED SHORTEN TIME

00:29:20.058 --> 00:29:23.729 region:rollup2
AT HOME BETWEEN THE DIPLOMATS.

00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:25.430 region:rollup2
MORE RETURNING HOME WITH

00:29:23.729 --> 00:29:26.965 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC MENTAL AND MORAL

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:29.835 region:rollup2
INJURIES.

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:31.470 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO VETERANS.

00:29:29.835 --> 00:29:33.672 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO MILLION VETERANS OR

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.606 region:rollup2
IN THE US TODAY. AND OVER ONE

00:29:33.672 --> 00:29:36.274 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THAT IS OF OUR

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:37.743 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:39.645 region:rollup2
EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND M.

00:29:37.743 --> 00:29:40.746 region:rollup2
OF VIETNAM VETERANS.

00:29:39.645 --> 00:29:42.347 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S A FAMILY SIDE OF

00:29:40.746 --> 00:29:43.548 region:rollup2
THE STORY.

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:44.616 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ONE POINT TWO MILLION

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:46.785 region:rollup2
CHILDREN OF ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:48.620 region:rollup2
SERVICE MEMBERS.

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:50.322 region:rollup2
THE AVERAGE MILITARY CHAO WILL

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:53.258 region:rollup2
MOVE TEN TIMES DOING THEIR

00:29:50.322 --> 00:29:53.258 region:rollup2
PARENTS CARILLO.

00:29:53.325 --> 00:29:56.128 region:rollup2
FAMILIES LIVE OFF THE MILITARY

00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:57.062 region:rollup2
INSULATION IN THE CIVILIAN

00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:58.797 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT'S A

00:29:57.062 --> 00:29:59.998 region:rollup2
POSITIVE BY THE WAY.

00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:01.667 region:rollup2
NEARLY TWO MILLION CHILDREN HAVE

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:04.036 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED APPARENT DEPLOYMENT

00:30:01.667 --> 00:30:05.337 region:rollup2
SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE.

00:30:04.036 --> 00:30:07.339 region:rollup2
DIPLOMATS AVERAGE EIGHT MONTHS

00:30:05.337 --> 00:30:09.441 region:rollup2
THAT'S REPRESENTED THAT REPEATED

00:30:07.339 --> 00:30:12.010 region:rollup2
ANIMALS OFTEN WHAT DO A FAMILY

00:30:09.441 --> 00:30:13.345 region:rollup2
MEMBER HAD HOUSEHOLDS.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.414 region:rollup2
IT'S OPERATIONAL TEMPO AND THE

00:30:13.345 --> 00:30:17.115 region:rollup2
RESIDENT RESIDUAL OF FIFTEEN

00:30:15.414 --> 00:30:18.717 region:rollup2
YEARS OF NEAR CONTINUOUS COMBAT.

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:20.252 region:rollup2
HAS PUT A STRESS ON THE FORCE

00:30:18.717 --> 00:30:22.154 region:rollup2
HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

00:30:20.252 --> 00:30:24.022 region:rollup2
AND SLEPT MANY WITHIN WITH

00:30:22.154 --> 00:30:27.826 region:rollup2
INVISIBLE WOUNDS OF WAR.

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:29.628 region:rollup2
INVISIBLE WOUNDS LIKE PTSD TBI

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:31.229 region:rollup2
BUT WHICH MANY DO NOT SEEK

00:30:29.628 --> 00:30:33.265 region:rollup2
TREATMENT FOR FEAR OF NEGATIVE

00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:34.866 region:rollup2
STICK STIGMA.

00:30:33.265 --> 00:30:36.635 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN IN THE FACE OF THIS OUR

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:38.603 region:rollup2
TROOPS ARE EXPERIENCING AND

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:40.172 region:rollup2
EXPRESSING THE VALUE OF THE ARTS

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:41.306 region:rollup2
IN HELPING THEM HEAL AND COPE

00:30:40.172 --> 00:30:42.774 region:rollup2
WITH THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY

00:30:41.306 --> 00:30:43.809 region:rollup2
DEMANDS.

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:45.744 region:rollup2
OF BEING BROUGHT UP ON THEM AND

00:30:43.809 --> 00:30:47.346 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILIES.

00:30:45.744 --> 00:30:49.648 region:rollup2
THE ARTS IN MY OPINION OFFER A

00:30:47.346 --> 00:30:51.183 region:rollup2
NON STIGMATIZED ENVIRONMENT.

00:30:49.648 --> 00:30:53.185 region:rollup2
WHERE VETERANS CAN CHOOSE THEIR

00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:55.153 region:rollup2
OWN METHOD OF HEALING? AND CAN

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:58.490 region:rollup2
GO AND DEAL WITH AND CREATE WHAT

00:30:55.153 --> 00:31:00.225 region:rollup2
I CALL POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:01.560 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT.

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:03.095 region:rollup2
BECAUSE VETERANS DO NOT WANT TO

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.664 region:rollup2
BE SEEN AS VICTIMS THEY WANT TO

00:31:03.095 --> 00:31:07.833 region:rollup2
BE SEEN AS STRONG AND CAPABLE.

00:31:05.664 --> 00:31:09.434 region:rollup2
SO I JUST PUSH THE WORD BECAUSE

00:31:07.833 --> 00:31:10.836 region:rollup2
I'VE COMPENSATED WITH THEM AND I

00:31:09.434 --> 00:31:12.070 region:rollup2
REALIZED THAT WHAT THEY'RE

00:31:10.836 --> 00:31:15.040 region:rollup2
REALLY SEEKING HIS POSTTRAUMATIC

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:16.074 region:rollup2
STRESS STRENGTH.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.876 region:rollup2
NOW HOW DID ARTS GET TO THIS

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:20.011 region:rollup2
POINT OF CONVERGENCE.

00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:21.680 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY HAS ANY ART

00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:23.081 region:rollup2
HISTORIAN A ROOM WOULD TELL YOU.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.083 region:rollup2
THE BIG OUR EVOLUTION COVERS A

00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:26.752 region:rollup2
NEOLITHIC AND HOW HELLENISTIC

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:27.853 region:rollup2
PEERAGE THE RENAISSANCE AND ALSO

00:31:26.752 --> 00:31:29.721 region:rollup2
CONTEMPORARY ART PERIOD OF

00:31:27.853 --> 00:31:31.022 region:rollup2
EXPRESSION.

00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:33.458 region:rollup2
BUT THE PRACTICE RESULTS OF THE

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:35.160 region:rollup2
ARTS BIG EVOLUTION IS AT THE

00:31:33.458 --> 00:31:36.428 region:rollup2
ARTS HAVE PROGRESSED TO A POINT.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.997 region:rollup2
THAT WITHIN THE MILITARY

00:31:36.428 --> 00:31:39.564 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY ARTISTIC EXPRESSION IS

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:42.134 region:rollup2
BEING UTILIZED AS A TOOL TO

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:45.937 region:rollup2
HEAL.

00:31:42.134 --> 00:31:47.139 region:rollup2
MOBILE. AND SUSTAIN RESILIENCY.

00:31:45.937 --> 00:31:48.440 region:rollup2
AND ADVOCATING FOR THE VALUE OF

00:31:47.139 --> 00:31:50.142 region:rollup2
THE ARTS THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.376 region:rollup2
OF STATE ARTS AGENCIES LIST FIVE

00:31:50.142 --> 00:31:53.411 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL ARGUMENTS FOR THE ARTS

00:31:51.376 --> 00:31:54.713 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ONE IS. THE ARTS IN

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:56.014 region:rollup2
RICH THE AMERICAN ECONOMY

00:31:54.713 --> 00:31:57.449 region:rollup2
FESTIVAL ECONOMIC ARGUMENT FOR

00:31:56.014 --> 00:31:59.017 region:rollup2
THE ARTS.

00:31:57.449 --> 00:32:00.852 region:rollup2
THE ARTS OFFER SOLUTIONS FOR

00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:02.187 region:rollup2
RURAL AMERICA.

00:32:00.852 --> 00:32:03.488 region:rollup2
THE ARTS OFFER COST EFFECTIVE

00:32:02.187 --> 00:32:04.456 region:rollup2
HEALTH TREATMENT THAT WORKS AND

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:06.792 region:rollup2
YOU'LL HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT

00:32:04.456 --> 00:32:08.160 region:rollup2
TODAY AND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS.

00:32:06.792 --> 00:32:10.162 region:rollup2
THE ARTS IMPROVE EDUCATION

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.429 region:rollup2
VESTED EDUCATION ARGUMENT.

00:32:10.162 --> 00:32:12.264 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY THEY SAY THE ARTS

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:14.366 region:rollup2
OFFER A NET GAIN FOR THE

00:32:12.264 --> 00:32:15.767 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

00:32:14.366 --> 00:32:17.436 region:rollup2
BUT IF NUMBER FIVE IS TRUE AND I

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:19.137 region:rollup2
THINK IT IS.

00:32:17.436 --> 00:32:21.840 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THE ARTS COMMUNITY CAN

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:23.842 region:rollup2
NOW ADD A SIX VALUE OF THE ARTS.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.411 region:rollup2
I CALLED IT THE ARTS OFFER

00:32:23.842 --> 00:32:28.480 region:rollup2
BENEFITS TO NATIONAL SECURITY.

00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:30.649 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BE A TOOL TO ENABLE

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.850 region:rollup2
HEALING. BUILDING AND SUSTAINING

00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:33.718 region:rollup2
THE READINESS AND RESILIENCY OF

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.986 region:rollup2
THE FORCE

00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:36.488 region:rollup2
AND THAT GETS SET READ IS SO

00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:38.123 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY I'M KIND OF IT THE

00:32:36.488 --> 00:32:39.224 region:rollup2
TABLE MODEL OPERATIONAL GUY.

00:32:38.123 --> 00:32:40.659 region:rollup2
AND I HAD A EXPERIENCE THAT

00:32:39.224 --> 00:32:42.494 region:rollup2
SHOWED ME THAT POTENTIALLY I

00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:44.095 region:rollup2
WOULD BE CARRYING VETERANS.

00:32:42.494 --> 00:32:45.730 region:rollup2
OUR SERVICE MEMBERS BACK INTO

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:47.265 region:rollup2
WAR THAT HAD NOT TOTALLY HEALED.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.100 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY HAD INVISIBLE MOVES

00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:51.336 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHEN I BECAME ENGAGED

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.538 region:rollup2
IN IS BECAUSE THAT WAS A VERY

00:32:51.336 --> 00:32:54.873 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL PART FOR ME.

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:55.974 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE MOMENT IN TIME AS I

00:32:54.873 --> 00:32:57.642 region:rollup2
SHOULD WITH YOUR EARLY OR I

00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:58.944 region:rollup2
THINK ARTS OFFER SOLUTIONS TO

00:32:57.642 --> 00:33:00.879 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES OUR SERVICE

00:32:58.944 --> 00:33:02.714 region:rollup2
MEMBERS FACE. AND BY EXTENSION

00:33:00.879 --> 00:33:06.084 region:rollup2
THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION.

00:33:02.714 --> 00:33:07.719 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:08.787 region:rollup2
THIS AS I STATED IN MY OPENING

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:10.856 region:rollup2
COMMENTS IS A COMMUNITY

00:33:08.787 --> 00:33:12.023 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

00:33:10.856 --> 00:33:13.625 region:rollup2
AND THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAM

00:33:12.023 --> 00:33:15.660 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING.

00:33:13.625 --> 00:33:17.229 region:rollup2
VETERANS AND ARTS HEALING LIVES

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.663 region:rollup2
THROUGH CREATIVE EXPRESSIONS IS

00:33:17.229 --> 00:33:20.532 region:rollup2
NOT LIMITED TO THE MILITARY

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:21.933 region:rollup2
PORTION OF OUR COMMUNITY.

00:33:20.532 --> 00:33:23.435 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:25.070 region:rollup2
ICEBERG OF COMMUNITY

00:33:23.435 --> 00:33:27.372 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:29.374 region:rollup2
HEALING THAT ART CAN SUPPORT.

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:30.609 region:rollup2
HERE'S HERE'S WHERE IN MANY OF

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:33.178 region:rollup2
MY TALKS ON THIS SUBJECT ARE

00:33:30.609 --> 00:33:33.678 region:rollup2
NORMALLY ASK THE AUDIENCE.

00:33:33.178 --> 00:33:34.613 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES THE BATTLE OF

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:36.681 region:rollup2
FALLUJAH?

00:33:34.613 --> 00:33:38.683 region:rollup2
FORT LAUDERDALE AIRPORT.

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:40.752 region:rollup2
SEVEN HOOKED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:41.553 region:rollup2
AND THE BOSTON MARATHON. TELL US

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:44.756 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CURRENT REALITY OF OUR

00:33:41.553 --> 00:33:48.059 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:48.927 region:rollup2
IN ONE AND WORD ANSWER TRAUMA.

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:50.462 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE AWASH IN

00:33:48.927 --> 00:33:52.297 region:rollup2
TRAUMA.

00:33:50.462 --> 00:33:52.864 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE OUR SERVICEMEN WERE

00:33:52.297 --> 00:33:54.633 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED IN THE BATTLE OF

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:55.200 region:rollup2
FALLUJAH.

00:33:54.633 --> 00:33:56.167 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF IT

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.236 region:rollup2
LETTING UP.

00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:59.671 region:rollup2
JUST THINK OF THIS.

00:33:58.236 --> 00:34:01.473 region:rollup2
OF THE OF THE TWELVE LARGEST

00:33:59.671 --> 00:34:03.074 region:rollup2
MASS SHOOTINGS IN AMERICA.

00:34:01.473 --> 00:34:04.209 region:rollup2
SEVEN OF THEM HAVE OCCURRED

00:34:03.074 --> 00:34:06.144 region:rollup2
SINCE THE BATTLE OF FALLUJAH

00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:07.579 region:rollup2
OCCURRED.

00:34:06.144 --> 00:34:08.914 region:rollup2
THE MILITARY IS STILL FACED WITH

00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:11.349 region:rollup2
BALANCING THE HIGH OPERATIONAL

00:34:08.914 --> 00:34:12.417 region:rollup2
TEMPO WITH INCREASED TRAINING.

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:14.052 region:rollup2
THIS LOAD OFTEN FALLS

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:14.519 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY ON STATE

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:16.855 region:rollup2
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:18.323 region:rollup2
RESERVISTS.

00:34:16.855 --> 00:34:19.925 region:rollup2
AND HERE'S ANOTHER KEY POINT.

00:34:18.323 --> 00:34:21.159 region:rollup2
WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY LONELINESS

00:34:19.925 --> 00:34:23.228 region:rollup2
IS PROJECTED TO BE THE NEXT

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:24.729 region:rollup2
HEALTH CRISIS.

00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:25.564 region:rollup2
THE ARTS OFFER SOLUTIONS TO BOTH

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:27.699 region:rollup2
THE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN

00:34:25.564 --> 00:34:28.900 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:30.235 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.937 region:rollup2
EFFORTS THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO

00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:33.271 region:rollup2
THIS SOLUTION AND PROBABLY

00:34:31.937 --> 00:34:34.573 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THOSE AT THE STATE OF

00:34:33.271 --> 00:34:35.774 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IT'S

00:34:34.573 --> 00:34:38.343 region:rollup2
PURSUING.

00:34:35.774 --> 00:34:39.978 region:rollup2
THAT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE.

00:34:38.343 --> 00:34:41.313 region:rollup2
YOU SEE I RECENTLY PARTICIPATED.

00:34:39.978 --> 00:34:43.481 region:rollup2
IN THE THE CALIFORNIA ARTS

00:34:41.313 --> 00:34:45.283 region:rollup2
COUNCIL. OF SUMMIT THAT WAS HELD

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:46.818 region:rollup2
IN SAN DIEGO FOR THE CREATIVE

00:34:45.283 --> 00:34:48.687 region:rollup2
FORCES INITIATIVE.

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:50.822 region:rollup2
I LEARNED A VETERANS HERE IN

00:34:48.687 --> 00:34:53.458 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHO STATED. THE ARTS

00:34:50.822 --> 00:34:53.992 region:rollup2
SAVE THEIR LIVES.

00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:55.627 region:rollup2
SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE

00:34:53.992 --> 00:34:56.962 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES THE FIRST ONE IS A

00:34:55.627 --> 00:34:58.296 region:rollup2
NATIONAL INITIATIVE ARTS AND

00:34:56.962 --> 00:34:59.698 region:rollup2
HEALTH IN THE MILITARY WHICH

00:34:58.296 --> 00:35:01.232 region:rollup2
SEEKS TO ADVANCE THE ARTS AND

00:34:59.698 --> 00:35:03.001 region:rollup2
HEALTH HEALING AND HEALTH CARE

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:05.070 region:rollup2
FOR MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS.

00:35:03.001 --> 00:35:06.071 region:rollup2
VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.173 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE'S.

00:35:06.071 --> 00:35:09.841 region:rollup2
VETO INDICATED THE VETERANS

00:35:08.173 --> 00:35:11.209 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ARTS AND

00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:12.677 region:rollup2
HUMANITIES HAS A PILOT PROJECT

00:35:11.209 --> 00:35:14.112 region:rollup2
THAT'S EVALUATING THE

00:35:12.677 --> 00:35:15.747 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE OUTCOMES.

00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:16.414 region:rollup2
THEY'RE FOCUSING ON CREATIVE

00:35:15.747 --> 00:35:18.683 region:rollup2
ARTS THERAPIES AND OUR

00:35:16.414 --> 00:35:20.318 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS IN PATIENT CENTERED

00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:21.786 region:rollup2
CARE OF. PLANNING.

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:24.456 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALSO MAPPING OUT LOCAL

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:25.624 region:rollup2
ARTS RESOURCES AT EACH SITE.

00:35:24.456 --> 00:35:27.025 region:rollup2
AND I MENTION THESE BECAUSE I

00:35:25.624 --> 00:35:28.560 region:rollup2
THINK THEY OFFER PATERNS FOR

00:35:27.025 --> 00:35:30.295 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE STATES AND THE NEXT

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.663 region:rollup2
ONE. THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR

00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:33.031 region:rollup2
THE ARTS CREATIVE FORCES

00:35:31.663 --> 00:35:35.767 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE IS A UNIQUE

00:35:33.031 --> 00:35:37.435 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN DOD AN NEA.

00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:39.537 region:rollup2
AND BELIEVE ME WHEN YOU GET DOD

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:41.239 region:rollup2
ANY ANY A AND A ROOM TO AGREE.

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:42.741 region:rollup2
YOU'VE AFRICA THING GOING. BUT I

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:44.075 region:rollup2
THINK IT ALSO REPRESENTS A

00:35:42.741 --> 00:35:47.078 region:rollup2
MODERATE AND PATTERN FOR A LOT

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:47.912 region:rollup2
OF OF STATE ORGANIZATIONSWHO

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:48.847 region:rollup2
MAY WANT TO PURSUE IT.

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:50.815 region:rollup2
THIS INITIATIVE WAS LAUNCHED BY

00:35:48.847 --> 00:35:52.183 region:rollup2
ANY A AND DOD AND TWO THOUSAND

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:52.951 region:rollup2
ELEVEN. THAT MANY OF THE

00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:54.519 region:rollup2
NATIONAL INTREPID CENTERS OF

00:35:52.951 --> 00:35:56.087 region:rollup2
EXCELLENCE.

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:57.922 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WATER READS THAT'S

00:35:56.087 --> 00:35:59.791 region:rollup2
LOCATED IN THE FASTER AND NOW IT

00:35:57.922 --> 00:36:01.226 region:rollup2
HAS EXPANDED TO SEVEN DIFFERENT

00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:02.961 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY

00:36:01.226 --> 00:36:05.897 region:rollup2
ONE OF THEM IS HERE IN.

00:36:02.961 --> 00:36:07.232 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WITH SAN DIEGO.

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:08.266 region:rollup2
IT EXTENDS THERAPEUTIC ART

00:36:07.232 --> 00:36:09.467 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENTS INTO THE COMMUNITY

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:11.302 region:rollup2
OF PATIENTS

00:36:09.467 --> 00:36:13.038 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS WE REALIZE AND

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:13.905 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE IT THAT FIFTY PERCENT

00:36:13.038 --> 00:36:14.773 region:rollup2
OF THE VETERANS WHO NEED

00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:16.374 region:rollup2
TREATMENT DON'T EVER GET THE

00:36:14.773 --> 00:36:17.409 region:rollup2
TREATMENT.

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:18.543 region:rollup2
AND THEY DON'T GET INTO THE

00:36:17.409 --> 00:36:20.378 region:rollup2
MEDICAL WORLD IN THE IN THE

00:36:18.543 --> 00:36:20.979 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT BECAUSE

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:22.147 region:rollup2
OF THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH

00:36:20.979 --> 00:36:23.448 region:rollup2
IT.

00:36:22.147 --> 00:36:25.316 region:rollup2
I THINK THE ARTS CREATE THAT

00:36:23.448 --> 00:36:26.151 region:rollup2
AVENUE AND METHOD AN ALTERNATIVE

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:27.986 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY CAN SEEK THAT

00:36:26.151 --> 00:36:29.354 region:rollup2
TREATMENT ON THEIR OWN AND NOT

00:36:27.986 --> 00:36:29.988 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT STIGMA.

00:36:29.354 --> 00:36:32.891 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE

00:36:29.988 --> 00:36:34.592 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ANY A DOD.

00:36:32.891 --> 00:36:35.927 region:rollup2
STATE AND LOCAL ARTS AGENCIES

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:37.062 region:rollup2
AND AMERICANS FOR THE ARTS WHO

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:38.797 region:rollup2
SERVES AS ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE

00:36:37.062 --> 00:36:39.764 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

00:36:38.797 --> 00:36:40.565 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:41.633 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT THE NATIONAL

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:43.268 region:rollup2

THE ARTS.

00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:51.776 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THREE GOES ASSOCIATED

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:53.445 region:rollup2
WITH THIS INITIATIVE THAT I LIKE

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:55.280 region:rollup2
TO HIGHLIGHT.

00:36:53.445 --> 00:36:56.614 region:rollup2
POLICY DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS AN

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.949 region:rollup2
EFFORT TO HAVE EACH AND EVERY

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:17.889 region:rollup2
AND A TALENT WITHIN THEMSELVES.

00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:19.190 region:rollup2
BUT THEY DO SO WITH THE IDEA OF

00:39:17.889 --> 00:39:20.758 region:rollup2
GIVING BACK. RIGHT.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.893 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IF WE CAN HIGHLIGHT

00:39:20.758 --> 00:39:22.861 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THERE'S MORE ARE

00:39:21.893 --> 00:39:24.929 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LITTLE COMMONALITY IN

00:39:22.861 --> 00:39:26.264 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE CULTURE.

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:27.632 region:rollup2
AND AND GO INTO THE DISCUSSION

00:39:26.264 --> 00:39:28.967 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I THINK IT HELPS US

00:39:27.632 --> 00:39:30.535 region:rollup2
GET TO THE NEXT STOP POINT

00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:32.503 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW MAKE CARS. I THINK THE

00:39:30.535 --> 00:39:33.838 region:rollup2
FIRST POINT OF OF THE DILUTED

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:35.473 region:rollup2
TOO WHEN I TALK ABOUT

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:36.507 region:rollup2
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS.

00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:37.709 region:rollup2
WHAT PARENTS WANT MOST

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:39.477 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY FROM THOSE WHO ARE

00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:40.545 region:rollup2
PROVIDING ANY TYPE OF CARE IN A

00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:42.313 region:rollup2
TYPE OF TREATMENT FOR THEM AS A

00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:43.181 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:44.449 region:rollup2
NOT BROKEN BUT THEY ARE TRYING

00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:46.050 region:rollup2
TO? TO REGAIN US LEVEL OF

00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:46.885 region:rollup2
STRENGTH THAT THEY HAD PRIOR TO

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.820 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:39:46.885 --> 00:39:49.921 region:rollup2
SO THAT CULTURE OF STRAND.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.489 region:rollup2
NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT

00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:52.991 region:rollup2
FOR THE MILITARY THAT BECOMES A

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:54.993 region:rollup2
WEAKNESS BECAUSE.

00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:56.394 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A STUDY THAT

00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:58.162 region:rollup2
INDICATED.

00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:59.497 region:rollup2
THE FIFTEEN THINGS THAT SERVICE

00:39:58.162 --> 00:40:01.366 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WANTED THE COMMUNITY

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:03.301 region:rollup2
KNOW ABOUT THEM.

00:40:01.366 --> 00:40:05.336 region:rollup2
NUMBER SEVEN WAS IS THAT IT'S

00:40:03.301 --> 00:40:06.905 region:rollup2
HARD FOR US TO ASK FOR HELP AND.

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:08.306 region:rollup2
SO THAT CULTURE OR THE MILITARY

00:40:06.905 --> 00:40:10.341 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE OVERCOME BUT I THINK

00:40:08.306 --> 00:40:12.043 region:rollup2
IT ALL COMES BY THE IDEA THAT

00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:13.878 region:rollup2
THE ARTS DISS THE STRENGTH NOW

00:40:12.043 --> 00:40:15.980 region:rollup2
OF THE OF THAT. THE ARTS PROVIDE

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:17.482 region:rollup2
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY CAN GO

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.816 region:rollup2
WE AND SELECT.

00:40:17.482 --> 00:40:20.852 region:rollup2
AND SHOES WITHOUT BEING

00:40:18.816 --> 00:40:22.553 region:rollup2
STIGMATIZE.

00:40:20.852 --> 00:40:24.355 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT ASPECT OFOF

00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:26.024 region:rollup2
WHAT THE ART OUR CULTURE OFFERS

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:27.358 region:rollup2
IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:40:26.024 --> 00:40:28.860 region:rollup2
I THINK THE ONLY DARK SIDE OF

00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:30.762 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.030 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THE IMPORTANT

00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:33.231 region:rollup2
THING IS AND I USE A MEDICAL

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:35.133 region:rollup2
UPON METAPHOR FOR THIS DO NO

00:40:33.231 --> 00:40:36.601 region:rollup2
HARM.

00:40:35.133 --> 00:40:38.336 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CULTURAL ASPECT IS

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:40.104 region:rollup2
TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T

00:40:38.336 --> 00:40:42.340 region:rollup2
WORKED WITH THE POPULATION.

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:43.341 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND AWARENESS OF ABOUT

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.642 region:rollup2
WHAT'S CLEAR IS VERY VERY

00:40:43.341 --> 00:40:45.943 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND I'M SURE YOU HEAR

00:40:44.642 --> 00:40:47.378 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THOSE WHO ARE WORKING

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:48.646 region:rollup2
IN THOSE PROGRAMS LATER ON AND

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:50.848 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY TO TO GIVE EVIDENCE TO

00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:52.116 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:54.652 region:rollup2
I HOPE THAT ANSWERED CAN'T THANK

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:55.219 region:rollup2
YOU ENOUGH.

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:58.122 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE

00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:59.290 region:rollup2
HIM.

00:40:58.122 --> 00:41:01.826 region:rollup2
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:03.861 region:rollup2
SHARING IT. LISTENING TO YOU

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:06.965 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY REMINDED ME OF THEM.

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:08.499 region:rollup2
A SEGMENT THAT IWAS LISTENING

00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:10.368 region:rollup2
TO ON PUBLIC RADIO.

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:13.304 region:rollup2
WITH A MEMBER OF THE ARMED

00:41:10.368 --> 00:41:15.707 region:rollup2
FORCES WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT.

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:17.008 region:rollup2
SOME CHALLENGES HE WAS DEALING

00:41:15.707 --> 00:41:17.909 region:rollup2
WITH WITH.

00:41:17.008 --> 00:41:20.578 region:rollup2
A YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS.

00:41:17.909 --> 00:41:22.347 region:rollup2
.

00:41:20.578 --> 00:41:24.749 region:rollup2
AND DYING AND.

00:41:22.347 --> 00:41:27.452 region:rollup2
EMPATHY.

00:41:24.749 --> 00:41:28.720 region:rollup2
WAS A WORD THAT HE KEPT BRINGING

00:41:27.452 --> 00:41:32.357 region:rollup2
UP.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:34.892 region:rollup2
AND HOW HE WAS FIGHTING BACK.

00:41:32.357 --> 00:41:36.260 region:rollup2
HE MOTIONS AS IT RELATES TO HOW

00:41:34.892 --> 00:41:38.796 region:rollup2
HE WAS FEELING ABOUT.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.364 region:rollup2
THIS YOUNG GIRL BECAUSE HE HAD

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:42.600 region:rollup2
BEEN TRAINED TO NOT WANT TO

00:41:39.364 --> 00:41:44.068 region:rollup2
FEEL.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.304 region:rollup2
BECAUSE EMPATHY WAS CONSIDERED A

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:49.140 region:rollup2
WEAKNESS.

00:41:46.304 --> 00:41:51.476 region:rollup2
AND YET THE VERY FACT THAT HE

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:54.512 region:rollup2
HAD. THESE EMOTIONS ACTUALLY

00:41:51.476 --> 00:41:56.748 region:rollup2
ALLOWED HIM TO COMMUNICATE WITH

00:41:54.512 --> 00:42:00.184 region:rollup2
THE YOUNG GIRLS PARENTS.

00:41:56.748 --> 00:42:01.919 region:rollup2
AT HER FUNERAL BECAUSE SHE DIED.

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:04.088 region:rollup2
BUT IT MADE WE THINK ABOUT WHAT

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:05.656 region:rollup2
YOU WERE SAYING IN THE NEXUS

00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:07.392 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE MILITARY COMMUNITY

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:09.193 region:rollup2
AND THE ARTS COMMUNITY BECAUSE

00:42:07.392 --> 00:42:10.728 region:rollup2
ON THE ONE HAND THE ARTS

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:12.697 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IS ALSO ABOUT.

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:14.665 region:rollup2
INVOKING EMPATHY INVULNERABILITY

00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:17.368 region:rollup2
AND ALLOWING PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:19.937 region:rollup2
AND UNCOMFORTABLE SPACES. AND

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:20.471 region:rollup2
THE MILITARY WE SOMETIMES DON'T

00:42:19.937 --> 00:42:23.041 region:rollup2
WANT TO THINK ABOUT THOSE

00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:25.643 region:rollup2
THINGS.

00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:27.945 region:rollup2
AND SO HOW CAN WE COLLECTIVELY

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:30.782 region:rollup2
DO A BETTER JOB OF TRYING TO

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:32.984 region:rollup2
BRIDGE THOSE GAPS BECAUSE I'M.

00:42:30.782 --> 00:42:34.719 region:rollup2
OF THE BELIEF THAT IT'S OKAY TO

00:42:32.984 --> 00:42:36.921 region:rollup2
FEEL COMFORTABLE UNCOMFORTABLE

00:42:34.719 --> 00:42:38.456 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE IN A SAFE SPACE THAT

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:41.359 region:rollup2
ALLOWS YOU TO WORK THROUGH THAT.

00:42:38.456 --> 00:42:43.494 region:rollup2
AND OBVIOUSLY THE ARTS ARE.

00:42:41.359 --> 00:42:46.164 region:rollup2
.

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:47.632 region:rollup2
IT'S A WAY FOR VETERANS FOR

00:42:46.164 --> 00:42:50.034 region:rollup2
EVERYONE BUT FOR THOSE IN THE

00:42:47.632 --> 00:42:51.969 region:rollup2
MILITARY TO. TO CONNECT TO SOME

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:53.738 region:rollup2
OF THOSE.

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:56.007 region:rollup2
FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS.

00:42:53.738 --> 00:42:57.041 region:rollup2
THAT HOPEFULLY OUR OUR CHECKERS

00:42:56.007 --> 00:42:59.977 region:rollup2
FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAT COULD

00:42:57.041 --> 00:43:02.380 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE PTS.

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:05.283 region:rollup2
THE. POST TRAUMATIC STRENGTHENED

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:07.018 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE KIND OF LOOK.

00:43:05.283 --> 00:43:09.253 region:rollup2
TO DE STIGMATIZE.

00:43:07.018 --> 00:43:11.155 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE.

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:12.757 region:rollup2
FEELINGS AND SPACE SAYS THAT WE

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:16.327 region:rollup2
TRY TO SEPARATE.

00:43:12.757 --> 00:43:17.428 region:rollup2
FROM THE MILITARY EXPERIENCE.

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:20.231 region:rollup2
WELL I WOULD SAY THAT.

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:22.667 region:rollup2
.

00:43:20.231 --> 00:43:24.769 region:rollup2
PROBABLY. THIS IS WHERE THE ARTS

00:43:22.667 --> 00:43:26.437 region:rollup2
ALMOST STRONG COMPARED TO A LOT

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:28.873 region:rollup2
OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS.

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:30.208 region:rollup2
I'M FASCINATED TO WHEN I LOOK

00:43:28.873 --> 00:43:31.876 region:rollup2
AT SOME OF THE THE DIFFERENT

00:43:30.208 --> 00:43:33.711 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WITHOUT WITHIN ALL THE

00:43:31.876 --> 00:43:35.480 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES.

00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:36.747 region:rollup2
THAT PUT PUT VETERAN SHARE WITH

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.683 region:rollup2
ME IS THAT.

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:39.951 region:rollup2
THEY NEED A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN

00:43:38.683 --> 00:43:41.352 region:rollup2
GO IN FIRST OF ALL HAVE A

00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:42.887 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH THEMSELVES

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:44.322 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES TO THE

00:43:42.887 --> 00:43:45.823 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES SHE DID FEEL THEY

00:43:44.322 --> 00:43:46.791 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO TO TALK

00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:48.693 region:rollup2
WITH ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE

00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:50.828 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED.

00:43:48.693 --> 00:43:52.396 region:rollup2
AND SO I I THINK THAT IF WE CAN

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:54.532 region:rollup2
CONTINUE PROGRAMS AND AND THOSE

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:56.067 region:rollup2
ARE OF.

00:43:54.532 --> 00:43:57.535 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS I THINK THAT THE ART

00:43:56.067 --> 00:43:58.970 region:rollup2
REALLY HAS A STRONG POTENTIAL TO

00:43:57.535 --> 00:44:00.972 region:rollup2
HELP WITH.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:02.039 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS THE THE SERVICE

00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:03.174 region:rollup2
MEMBER OF THE FAMILY MEMBER I

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:05.343 region:rollup2
WAS MENTIONING.

00:44:03.174 --> 00:44:06.911 region:rollup2
AT THE BEGINNING HERE. THAT IT

00:44:05.343 --> 00:44:08.412 region:rollup2
ALSO GETS INTO THE EDUCATION OF

00:44:06.911 --> 00:44:09.447 region:rollup2
ARTS BECAUSE IF YOU GET IT TO

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:10.848 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN YOU ALSO GET THE

00:44:09.447 --> 00:44:12.683 region:rollup2
PARENTS AND OFTENTIMES I'VE I'VE

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:14.285 region:rollup2
FOUND. A LOT OF VETERANS HAVE

00:44:12.683 --> 00:44:15.987 region:rollup2
GOTTEN INTO ART PROGRAMS BECAUSE

00:44:14.285 --> 00:44:17.555 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN BROUGHT THEM INTO

00:44:15.987 --> 00:44:19.590 region:rollup2
THE ARTS PROGRAM.

00:44:17.555 --> 00:44:21.592 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD SAY THERE TO LOOK

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:23.194 region:rollup2
HOLISTICALLY. IS IT WOULD BE MY

00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:24.896 region:rollup2
ANSWER TOOK TO LOOK TO LOOK

00:44:23.194 --> 00:44:26.631 region:rollup2
HOLISTICALLY CROSSED WHAT PARTS

00:44:24.896 --> 00:44:28.199 region:rollup2
OF PROVIDING NOT JUST AT THE

00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:30.801 region:rollup2
SERVICE MEMORABLE BUT ALSO CARE

00:44:28.199 --> 00:44:31.836 region:rollup2
GIVER BUT ALSO. THAT THE CHAO.

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:33.404 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY I WENT TO THE

00:44:31.836 --> 00:44:35.439 region:rollup2
POINT OF MAKING THOSE STATISTICS

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:37.208 region:rollup2
AND MY DISCUSSION BECAUSE.

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:37.808 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN ALSO A PART OF THIS

00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:39.644 region:rollup2
AND AND I WOULD JUST SAY ALSO

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:41.746 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:44:39.644 --> 00:44:44.448 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST THE.

00:44:41.746 --> 00:44:45.783 region:rollup2
PTSD TBI END OF THE SPECTRUM

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:47.184 region:rollup2
THAT THAT YOU WE ADDRESS

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:48.786 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE. A LOT OF THESE

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:50.454 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES COME WILL FUND

00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:51.789 region:rollup2
TRANSITION FROM THE MILITARY

00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:53.324 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND GOING BACK INTO THE TO

00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:55.493 region:rollup2
TO CIVILIAN LIFE.

00:44:53.324 --> 00:44:57.061 region:rollup2
IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH LIFESTYLE

00:44:55.493 --> 00:44:59.363 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT THE CHALLENGES THEY

00:44:57.061 --> 00:45:01.365 region:rollup2
FACE HAVE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:03.034 region:rollup2
IT HAS SUICIDE IMPLICATE ME DOES

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:04.402 region:rollup2
A LOT OF. ASPECTS OF THE

00:45:03.034 --> 00:45:06.871 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM THAT.

00:45:04.402 --> 00:45:08.639 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ART CAN ALSO ALLOW

00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:10.474 region:rollup2
THEM TO HEAL IN THE HEALTH AND.

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:17.048 region:rollup2
I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION.

STANDING THERE.

00:48:47.558 --> 00:48:49.994 region:rollup2
ON THE BRINK OF OBLIVION.

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:51.562 region:rollup2
IMAGINING HIS* PLEASE

EXISTENCE.

00:48:51.562 --> 00:48:54.932 region:rollup2
WHETHER TO TAKE THAT STEP.

00:48:53.631 --> 00:48:56.500 region:rollup2
HE SWAYS WITH THE MILD WHEN

00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:58.569 region:rollup2
ALLOWING ITS PRES TO CARESS HIM

00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.471 region:rollup2
LIKE A MOTHER ROCKS HER CHILD.

00:48:58.569 --> 00:49:02.139 region:rollup2
HE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER. AS

00:49:00.471 --> 00:49:03.240 region:rollup2
IF TO SEE IF SOMEONE IS THERE TO

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.077 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO ONE.

00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:10.548 region:rollup2
I IMAGINE HE IS ALONE IN THIS

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:11.916 region:rollup2
WORLD AND THAT THIS IS ONLY WAY.

00:49:10.548 --> 00:49:13.517 region:rollup2

00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:14.685 region:rollup2
EYE HAS CHANGED NO LONGER IS IT

00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:19.256 region:rollup2
OF DETERMINATION.

00:49:16.854 --> 00:49:21.459 region:rollup2
HE TAKES THE STEP IDLING CLOSER

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:23.394 region:rollup2
AS IF TO STOP HIM I SCREAM IN MY

00:49:21.459 --> 00:49:24.795 region:rollup2
HEAD FOR HIM TO GO BACK. MY HAND

00:49:23.394 --> 00:49:25.296 region:rollup2
INSTINCTIVELY REACHES OUT AS

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:26.497 region:rollup2
THOUGH I COULD PUSH HIM

00:49:25.296 --> 00:49:28.098 region:rollup2
BACKWARDS FROM FIVE HUNDRED

00:49:26.497 --> 00:49:30.167 region:rollup2

00:49:32.703 --> 00:49:36.740 region:rollup2
DEAFENING SILENCE.

00:49:35.005 --> 00:49:38.242 region:rollup2
I STRENGTHENED MY RESOLVE AND

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.278 region:rollup2

WATCHING HIM WALK TOWARDS ME.

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:45.382 region:rollup2

TO SURVIVE IN A COMBAT SITUATION

00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:48.118 region:rollup2
HOW TO FIGHT HOW TO READ OTHERS

00:49:47.151 --> 00:49:49.687 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE A

00:49:48.118 --> 00:49:52.056 region:rollup2
THREAT. I HAVE TRAINED FOR

ACTRESS TO MY RIFLE AND SITES

00:49:56.961 --> 00:50:00.197 region:rollup2
ARMED WITH NEAR PINPOINT

00:49:58.262 --> 00:50:02.366 region:rollup2
ACCURACY. I HAVE LEARNED TO NUMB

00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:03.767 region:rollup2
MY EMOTIONS BY THE LOSS OF MY

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:05.336 region:rollup2
CLOSEST FRIENDS.

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:07.071 region:rollup2
AND SING WHAT MY OWN RIFLE CAN

00:50:05.336 --> 00:50:08.239 region:rollup2
DO TO THE ENEMY.

00:50:07.071 --> 00:50:09.607 region:rollup2
I CAN SHOOT A MAN IN THE CENTER

00:50:08.239 --> 00:50:11.508 region:rollup2
OF THIS CHEST FROM NEARLY FIVE

00:50:09.607 --> 00:50:12.910 region:rollup2
HUNDRED YARDS AWAY. AND PUT MY

00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:13.944 region:rollup2
KNIFE THROUGH HIS THROAT SO

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:15.880 region:rollup2

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:16.413 region:rollup2
CAVITIES IN HIS MOUTH.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.415 region:rollup2
I HAVE GONE THROUGH

00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:21.585 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES BEFORE

00:50:38.002 --> 00:50:40.905 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN YEAR OLD SON WALKING

00:50:40.905 --> 00:50:44.408 region:rollup2

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.910 region:rollup2
HE'S WALKING TO A DISCARDED

00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:46.343 region:rollup2
VEHICLE LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN

REMINDER OF THE HORRORS THIS

00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:57.621 region:rollup2
HE WALKS WITH PURPOSE. KNOWING

00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:59.089 region:rollup2

00:50:57.621 --> 00:51:00.824 region:rollup2
SHATTERED WHOLE CORRODING IN THE

00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:02.393 region:rollup2
SAND HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND

00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:04.728 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T SELL TO

00:51:02.393 --> 00:51:06.030 region:rollup2
THE TALIBAN HE KNOWS. THAT THE

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:07.531 region:rollup2

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:08.999 region:rollup2
THE BIGGER THE ITEM THE MORE

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:11.368 region:rollup2
DESTRUCTIVE CAN BE THE BETTER

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:13.137 region:rollup2

00:51:16.774 --> 00:51:19.677 region:rollup2
HE KNOWS THAT THE MARINES

00:51:19.677 --> 00:51:23.747 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY ARE

00:51:21.345 --> 00:51:25.316 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZED TO SHOOT AND KILL

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:26.350 region:rollup2
ANYONE THEY DEEM A THREAT. HIS

00:51:25.316 --> 00:51:27.651 region:rollup2
LIVELIHOOD DEPENDS ON WHAT HE

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:28.652 region:rollup2
FINDS.

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:30.054 region:rollup2
JUST AS THE WEAPON HE WEARS

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:31.555 region:rollup2
ACROSS HIS BACK IT HIS WAY TO

00:51:30.054 --> 00:51:33.090 region:rollup2
SURVIVE.

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:35.125 region:rollup2
HE'S BEEN RAISED HERE AND HE

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:38.495 region:rollup2
KNOWS THAT THERE IS SAFETY IN

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:40.097 region:rollup2
THE FIELD. SEEN SO MUCH DEATH.

00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:41.665 region:rollup2
MANY HAVE TRIED BEFORE HIM THE

BILL THE STREWN WITH SIGNS OF

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:44.969 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO LEFT FELL.

00:51:42.1000 --> 00:51:46.904 region:rollup2
SHREDS OF CLOTH HERE A CRATER

00:51:44.969 --> 00:51:48.872 region:rollup2

00:51:46.904 --> 00:51:50.641 region:rollup2
HE KNOWS.

00:51:48.872 --> 00:51:52.409 region:rollup2
WHERE DEATH ONCE WAS

00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:53.377 region:rollup2
HE IS SAFE?

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:55.713 region:rollup2
PORTLAND MY CAN ONLY EXPLODE

00:51:53.377 --> 00:51:57.281 region:rollup2
ONCE.

00:51:55.713 --> 00:51:58.983 region:rollup2
HE RIDES AT A CRATER AND JUMPS

00:51:57.281 --> 00:52:00.284 region:rollup2
INSIDE RESTING FOR A MOMENT

00:51:58.983 --> 00:52:01.952 region:rollup2
KNEELING DOWN AS IF TO PRAY TO

00:52:00.284 --> 00:52:03.020 region:rollup2
HIS GUIDE.

00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:04.822 region:rollup2
TO GIVE HIM STRENGTH TO CONTINUE

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:06.256 region:rollup2
HIS JOURNEY AS HE HUNKERS DOWN

00:52:04.822 --> 00:52:07.791 region:rollup2
INTO THE DEPRESSION.

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:09.660 region:rollup2
I SEE MY OWN CHILDREN.

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:11.629 region:rollup2
PLAYING AT THE BEACH

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.230 region:rollup2
BUILDING SAND CASTLES BEARING

00:52:11.629 --> 00:52:14.865 region:rollup2
EACH OTHER. LAUGHING AS THEY

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:17.067 region:rollup2
WANTED TO JUMP RUN AND JUMP AND

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:17.635 region:rollup2
HOLES NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:18.802 region:rollup2
THE ONE THE BOYS BURSTING IN

00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:19.803 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:21.672 region:rollup2
ONLY THREE HUNDRED YARDS FROM MY

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:23.173 region:rollup2
POSITION.

00:52:21.672 --> 00:52:25.175 region:rollup2
FROM THIS DISTANCE I CAN EASILY

00:52:23.173 --> 00:52:26.243 region:rollup2
HIT MY TARGET.

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:27.778 region:rollup2
THE WIND IS SLIGHTLY BLOWING

00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:29.913 region:rollup2
FROM RIGHT TO LEFT THE SUN IS

00:52:27.778 --> 00:52:30.481 region:rollup2
BEHIND ME. EVERYTHING ALL

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.682 region:rollup2
SHADOWS AND HIGHLIGHTING MY

00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:32.616 region:rollup2
TARGET.

00:52:31.682 --> 00:52:34.585 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALITY WOULD BE AN EASY

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:35.452 region:rollup2
SIDE.

00:52:34.585 --> 00:52:37.421 region:rollup2
CAN BE JUSTIFIED UNDER THE

00:52:35.452 --> 00:52:39.156 region:rollup2
CURRENT RULES OF ENGAGEMENT.

00:52:37.421 --> 00:52:40.290 region:rollup2
AS I SIGHED IN ON THE BOY. I

00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:41.725 region:rollup2
MAKE THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:43.894 region:rollup2
TO MY RIFLE.

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:45.396 region:rollup2
I PROGRESS THE PISTOL GRIP.

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:46.897 region:rollup2
BONUS SLIGHTLY TOWARD ME.

00:52:45.396 --> 00:52:47.464 region:rollup2
ANSWERING THAT THE STOCK OF THE

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:49.299 region:rollup2
WEAPON IS COMFORTABLY IN MY

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:50.300 region:rollup2
SHOULDER.

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:52.469 region:rollup2
I REST THE BARREL OF THE WHAT MY

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:55.105 region:rollup2
WEAPON IN THE PLM MY FOREHAND

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:56.106 region:rollup2
ALLOWED TO JUST REST THERE.

00:52:55.105 --> 00:52:57.841 region:rollup2
WAITING UNTIL THE MOMENT IS

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:59.009 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

00:52:57.841 --> 00:53:00.144 region:rollup2
MY TRIGGER FINGER HOVERS NEXT TO

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:02.579 region:rollup2
TRIGGER.

00:53:00.144 --> 00:53:04.348 region:rollup2
WAITING FOR THE MOMENT.

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:07.151 region:rollup2
MY SHOOTING POSITIONS PERFECT.

00:53:04.348 --> 00:53:08.986 region:rollup2
NO ONE NO ONE WOULD QUESTION WHY

00:53:07.151 --> 00:53:10.287 region:rollup2
I PULLED THE TRIGGER.

00:53:08.986 --> 00:53:12.389 region:rollup2
I'D MORE THAN LIKELY GET A FEW

00:53:10.287 --> 00:53:13.891 region:rollup2
GOOD JOBS AND WHILE FROM THE

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:16.026 region:rollup2
YOUNGER LESS SEASON MARINES WHO

00:53:13.891 --> 00:53:17.828 region:rollup2
TALK OPENLY ABOUT SEEM TO SING

00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:18.395 region:rollup2
ACTION AND ONE IN THE SHOULD

00:53:17.828 --> 00:53:20.998 region:rollup2
SOMETHING OTHER THAN A PAPER

00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:21.899 region:rollup2
TARGET. YOUNG MARINES WHO HAVE

00:53:20.998 --> 00:53:23.300 region:rollup2
BEEN RAISED THAT PART OF THE

00:53:21.899 --> 00:53:25.402 region:rollup2
TELEVISION SCREEN PLANE MODERN

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.837 region:rollup2
WELL WARFARE AND SIMULATED WARS

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:28.572 region:rollup2
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:53:26.837 --> 00:53:30.607 region:rollup2
WHO ALSO TEND TO TREAT LIFE AS

00:53:28.572 --> 00:53:32.209 region:rollup2
JUST ANOTHER SIMILARITY?

00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:34.578 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS NO RESET BUTTON NO

00:53:32.209 --> 00:53:36.447 region:rollup2
PAUSE AND NO CHEAT CODES.

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:37.047 region:rollup2
I HOLD MY POSITION WATCHING THE

00:53:36.447 --> 00:53:39.116 region:rollup2
TARGET WITH MY FINGER NEXT TO

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:40.584 region:rollup2
TRIGGER.

00:53:39.116 --> 00:53:43.187 region:rollup2
HE LIFTS HIMSELF OUT OF HIS HOLE

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:43.787 region:rollup2
AND STANDS AT THE THRESHOLD.

00:53:43.187 --> 00:53:44.888 region:rollup2
HIS PRIDE IN THEIR FIFTY YARDS

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:45.722 region:rollup2
AWAY.

00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:47.224 region:rollup2
BUT I MIGHT AS WELL BE ONE

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:48.592 region:rollup2
HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND EVEN TEN

00:53:47.224 --> 00:53:50.561 region:rollup2
THOUSAND. FOR THE DISTANCE ISN'T

00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:51.061 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM.

00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:53.130 region:rollup2
IT'S WHAT'S BETWEEN AND

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:54.031 region:rollup2
UNDERNEATH.

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:56.400 region:rollup2
HE TAKES A STEP AND BEGINS TO

00:53:54.031 --> 00:53:58.702 region:rollup2
WALK AS HE MOVES HIS EYES ARE

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.837 region:rollup2
EVER VIGILANT SHIFTING SEARCHING

00:53:58.702 --> 00:54:01.939 region:rollup2
FOR TELL OF SOMETHING SOME KIND

00:53:59.837 --> 00:54:03.807 region:rollup2
OF DANGER.

00:54:01.939 --> 00:54:07.578 region:rollup2
BUT STEP AFTER BUT STEP HIS BODY

00:54:03.807 --> 00:54:09.880 region:rollup2
TENSES THAT MIGHT BE HIS LAST.

00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:11.081 region:rollup2
I GUESS SEEM CLEARER NOW.

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:13.016 region:rollup2
THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW THE DIRT

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:14.618 region:rollup2
ON HIS FACE. EVEN BEGINNING OF

00:54:13.016 --> 00:54:16.120 region:rollup2
MANHOOD AS A SLIGHT WISPY

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:17.821 region:rollup2
MUSTACHE STARTED TALKING ABOUT

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.756 region:rollup2
THE SLIP.

00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:20.758 region:rollup2
I CAN ALSO SEE THAT HE IS NO

00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:22.259 region:rollup2
STRANGER TO WAR.

00:54:20.758 --> 00:54:23.760 region:rollup2
A RAGGED SCAR RUNS FROM WHERE

00:54:22.259 --> 00:54:25.763 region:rollup2
HIS LEFT EAR SHOULD BE.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.197 region:rollup2
TO THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH.

00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:30.200 region:rollup2
HE'S MISSING TWO FINGERS FROM

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:31.235 region:rollup2
HIS LEFT HAND AND I POSTULATE.

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.336 region:rollup2
THAT HIS ENTIRE LEFT SIDE OF HIS

00:54:31.235 --> 00:54:34.138 region:rollup2
BODY IS BATTLE DAMAGED IN SOME

00:54:32.336 --> 00:54:36.340 region:rollup2
WAY.

00:54:34.138 --> 00:54:36.974 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY. THE AFFECTS OF A LAND

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.608 region:rollup2
MINE HE WAS PORTION TO WALK AWAY

00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:39.610 region:rollup2
FROM.

00:54:37.608 --> 00:54:40.144 region:rollup2
MORE THAN LIKELY.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:41.979 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN TOO MANY

00:54:40.144 --> 00:54:43.547 region:rollup2
TIMES.

00:54:41.979 --> 00:54:44.648 region:rollup2
WHEN HE WAS AN INFANT HIS MOTHER

00:54:43.547 --> 00:54:47.117 region:rollup2
SHOW THEM FROM THE DANGER

00:54:44.648 --> 00:54:47.718 region:rollup2
PROTECTING HIM WITH HER BODY.

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:53.090 region:rollup2
LEAVING SCARS CLOSELY IT JUST

00:54:47.718 --> 00:54:56.360 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:58.195 region:rollup2
YARDS AWAY FROM HIS PRIZE.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.796 region:rollup2
S. PACE IS SLOW AND METHODICAL

00:54:58.195 --> 00:55:03.133 region:rollup2
CHOOSING EACH STEP CAREFULLY.

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:03.934 region:rollup2
I CAN REMINISCE OF MY CHILDREN.

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:05.669 region:rollup2
WHEN I SEND THEM TO BED FOR THE

00:55:03.934 --> 00:55:07.571 region:rollup2
EVENING THE SLOW INTENTIONAL

00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:08.605 region:rollup2
WALK DOWN THE HALL HOPING A

00:55:07.571 --> 00:55:10.574 region:rollup2
REPRIEVE MIGHT COME FOR ME

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:12.609 region:rollup2
ALLOWING THEM JUST WATCH ONE

00:55:10.574 --> 00:55:14.878 region:rollup2
MORE SHOW.

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:17.781 region:rollup2
NO REPRIEVE EVER COMES FOR ME.

00:55:14.878 --> 00:55:18.348 region:rollup2
NOR WILL THAT BE FOR THE BOY WHO

00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:20.417 region:rollup2
WENT RISK WHERE EARLY IN MY

00:55:18.348 --> 00:55:22.186 region:rollup2
SIGHTS.

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:23.520 region:rollup2
HE'S ONLY YARDS AWAY THE

00:55:22.186 --> 00:55:26.356 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS LABOR WITHIN TS GRASP

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:28.091 region:rollup2
MY BODY STIFFENS READY TO FIRE.

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:30.227 region:rollup2
HE CLIMBS INTO THE MANGLE THE

00:55:28.091 --> 00:55:31.662 region:rollup2
MASS OF THE VEHICLE IT'S ANCIENT

00:55:30.227 --> 00:55:33.197 region:rollup2
ARMOR SHIELDED FROM MY GAZE.

00:55:31.662 --> 00:55:34.898 region:rollup2
THE WORLD ENVELOPES ME.

00:55:33.197 --> 00:55:35.666 region:rollup2
BEHIND ME I CAN HEAR THE DISTANT

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:37.701 region:rollup2
SOUND OF MUSIC PLAYING ON THE

00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:38.769 region:rollup2
RADIO MARINES ON A BREAK FROM

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:40.070 region:rollup2
THE WHAT LIES OUTSIDE OUR WALLS

00:55:38.769 --> 00:55:42.206 region:rollup2
ARE PLAYING CARDS ON.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:44.074 region:rollup2
HIDE THEIR MINDS.

00:55:42.206 --> 00:55:44.708 region:rollup2
THE SMELL OF BAKED CHICKEN BEING

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:45.709 region:rollup2
PREPARED THE EVENING MAILBOX UP

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:48.845 region:rollup2
TO ME

00:55:45.709 --> 00:55:50.147 region:rollup2
AND FOR A MOMENT I CAN RELAX.

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:51.248 region:rollup2
TECH.

00:55:50.147 --> 00:55:53.350 region:rollup2
TECH.

00:55:51.248 --> 00:55:56.553 region:rollup2
TECH.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:58.121 region:rollup2
THE SECONDS SLOWLY PASSES.

00:55:56.553 --> 00:55:59.122 region:rollup2
WHEN I SEE THE EXCEPT THE BOY

00:55:58.121 --> 00:56:01.291 region:rollup2
EXITING THE VEHICLE I AM

00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:03.727 region:rollup2
FUNNELED BACK INTO MY INTO THE

00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:05.095 region:rollup2
REALITY THAT LAY IN FRONT OF ME.

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:06.263 region:rollup2
AND IS HANDED THE WOODEN BOX

00:56:05.095 --> 00:56:07.664 region:rollup2
FILLED WITH MISCELLANEOUS WIRES

00:56:06.263 --> 00:56:08.599 region:rollup2

00:58:29.773 --> 00:58:32.642 region:rollup2
WAITING AND NEVER ENDING LINES

00:58:32.042 --> 00:58:33.643 region:rollup2
EVEN THE ONES THAT HAVE STOLEN

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:35.345 region:rollup2
FROM ME.

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:38.148 region:rollup2

SURVIVE HE WAS LOOKING FOR A WAY

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:44.654 region:rollup2
TO SURVIVE FOR MORE THAN JUST

00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:45.956 region:rollup2
TODAY.

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:48.792 region:rollup2

THE AND ASK FOR PERMISSION.

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:27.257 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THAT IS HOW THE BIRTH

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:29.526 region:rollup2
OF THE VETERANS ORG VENUE WAS

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:31.661 region:rollup2
FOUNDED AND STARTED.

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:33.363 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE VETERAN COMMUNITY

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:36.133 region:rollup2
I'M A IN AN OUTPATIENT AT THE

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:37.701 region:rollup2

WONDERFUL DOCTORS THERAPISTS.

ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF IN

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:46.810 region:rollup2
AMONG THE VETERAN COMMUNITY.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:49.779 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A COMMON GOAL.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:52.449 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WAS A DISCONNECT. IN.

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:54.885 region:rollup2
BETWEEN EACH COMPONENT.

01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:57.320 region:rollup2
AND THROUGH AN EXPERIMENT.

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:59.389 region:rollup2
I LAUNCH THE VETERANS ARE VENUE.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.858 region:rollup2
I WAS CHASTISED BECAUSE I DIDN'T

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:05.328 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH PROPER PROCEDURES.

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:06.863 region:rollup2
AND I WAS CHALLENGED TO FIND DEL

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:08.064 region:rollup2
IS THERE A MARKET REALLY FALL

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:10.500 region:rollup2
FAR.

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:12.369 region:rollup2
CAN I RELATE TO THEM TO SAY ART

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.703 region:rollup2
IS NOT A LUXURY PART IS

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:14.905 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL ART IS A VERY

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:16.640 region:rollup2
COMPONENT.

01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:17.941 region:rollup2
THE BIG BREEDS.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.910 region:rollup2
REFLECTION TRANQUILITY AND

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:22.812 region:rollup2
THOUGHT.

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:25.182 region:rollup2
VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:28.552 region:rollup2
CONDITION. AND UNDER THE RIGHT

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:31.655 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS EMOTIONS.

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:33.490 region:rollup2
SENSITIVITY. MINDFULNESS AND

01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:36.426 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE ITEMS ARE NOT PART

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:37.794 region:rollup2
OF THE DECORUM IN THE MILITARY.

01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:39.596 region:rollup2
ONCE YOU LEAVE THE MARYLAND

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:40.430 region:rollup2
MILITARY.

01:01:39.596 --> 01:01:42.465 region:rollup2
YOU REALIZE THAT YOU BECAME

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:44.768 region:rollup2
HUMAN AGAIN.

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:46.736 region:rollup2
AND THROUGH ART. THAT IS THE

01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:49.306 region:rollup2
BRIDGING OF THE GAP.

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:51.174 region:rollup2
THAT IS ALSO A COMMUNICATION

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:54.477 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY. OF

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:57.080 region:rollup2
CIVILIANS WHO HAD NEVER SERVED.

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:58.982 region:rollup2
BUT YET APPREHENSIVE. BUT YEAH.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.585 region:rollup2
EVASIVE.

01:01:58.982 --> 01:02:04.521 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE PUT A ONE. ALREADY

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:07.257 region:rollup2
EXHIBITS WERE BOTH COMMUNITIES

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:09.059 region:rollup2
THE VETERANS IN THE CIVILIANS.

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:11.861 region:rollup2
THE COME TOGETHER. LOOKING

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:14.631 region:rollup2
UNIQUE ART. AND FROM ONE MY LEFT

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:15.999 region:rollup2
EAR FOR MORE RIGHT HERE IT COULD

01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:19.002 region:rollup2
BE A CIVILIAN ASKING ME.

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:20.670 region:rollup2
WHILE THIS IS VERY INTERESTING I

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:23.006 region:rollup2
DO KNOW VETERANS FEEL THIS WAY.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:24.741 region:rollup2
BOB HOW DO YOU TALK TO THEM.

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:26.142 region:rollup2

TREATMENT COUNSELING AND SO

01:03:43.787 --> 01:03:50.660 region:rollup2
FORTH BECAUSE THE CREATIVITY.

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:53.530 region:rollup2
KNOCKS DOWN THE WALLS OF BEING.

THEREFORE THE HEALING PROCESS OF

01:03:58.068 --> 01:04:02.072 region:rollup2
ART. AT. THE BATES THROUGH

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:04.441 region:rollup2
CREATIVITY.

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:06.443 region:rollup2
AND THROUGH THESE PAINS SIPS I

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:08.645 region:rollup2
WAS ABLE TO PROVE BACK IN TWO

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:10.480 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND NINE

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:13.950 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. TO THE

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:15.985 region:rollup2
EARLY DATE OF CURRENT THAT PAIN

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:17.754 region:rollup2
SOUPS OR ESSENTIALS.

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:19.789 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE STAFF I'D I DON'T

01:04:17.754 --> 01:04:21.157 region:rollup2
WANT TO NAME ANY NAMES WHO WERE

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:22.892 region:rollup2
VERY VERY RESISTANCE TO IT SO

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:25.428 region:rollup2
THEREFORE I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:27.397 region:rollup2
SUPPORT. TO THE POINT WHERE

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:28.998 region:rollup2
BEING A VETERAN.

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:31.034 region:rollup2
AND STAYING TRUE TO THE ART.

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:33.069 region:rollup2
I'VE ACTUALLY PAWN JEWELRY TO

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:35.004 region:rollup2
MAKE IT HAPPEN.

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:37.307 region:rollup2
AND I'M VERY PROUD TO DO THAT

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:39.342 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT HAS TO GET DONE IN

01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:41.678 region:rollup2
THE MILITARY WHENEVER WE HAVE AN

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:43.279 region:rollup2

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:47.650 region:rollup2
MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:49.853 region:rollup2

WHO'S GONNA START BY TELLING YOU

01:15:11.407 --> 01:15:13.909 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY PERSONAL

01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:17.146 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WITH ART AND MY

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:19.582 region:rollup2
MILITARY BACKGROUND.

01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:21.183 region:rollup2
I NINE ELEVEN LIKE MOST OF YOU I

01:15:19.582 --> 01:15:21.684 region:rollup2
WATCHED IN HORROR AS THREE

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:23.519 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AMERICANS WERE

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:24.854 region:rollup2
MURDERED.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:26.589 region:rollup2
AFTER SEEING THIS I VOLUNTEERED

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:28.457 region:rollup2
TO GO TO AFGHANISTAN.

01:15:26.589 --> 01:15:29.291 region:rollup2
I WANT TO PAY BACK.

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:30.960 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO BE A PART OF THE

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:31.594 region:rollup2
OPERATION TO HUNT DOWN AND

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.029 region:rollup2
DESTROY THE PEOPLE WHO ATTACKED

01:15:31.594 --> 01:15:34.597 region:rollup2
US.

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:36.632 region:rollup2
FINALLY IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:15:34.597 --> 01:15:38.634 region:rollup2
THREE. MY ARMY RESERVE UNIT WAS

01:15:36.632 --> 01:15:39.969 region:rollup2
ACCEPTING VOLUNTEERS.

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:41.137 region:rollup2
BUT AFTER BEING MOBILIZED WE

01:15:39.969 --> 01:15:42.638 region:rollup2
WERE DIVERTED TO IRAQ Y. SERVED

01:15:41.137 --> 01:15:43.939 region:rollup2
IN MOSEL FOR A YEAR WHILE

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:45.508 region:rollup2

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:46.609 region:rollup2
DIVISIONS. STRYKER BRIGADE

01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:48.611 region:rollup2
COMBAT TEAM OUT OF FORT LEWIS

01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:49.879 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON.

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:51.914 region:rollup2
MY JOB WAS TO SAFEGUARD

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:52.581 region:rollup2
CIVILIANS ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

01:15:51.914 --> 01:15:54.050 region:rollup2
AND I WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:56.719 region:rollup2
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO OVER

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:58.687 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND DISPLACED REFUGEES.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:59.922 region:rollup2
SERVING OUR MILITARY.

01:15:58.687 --> 01:16:01.390 region:rollup2
AT BEING A PART OF THE GLOBAL

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:02.625 region:rollup2
WAR ON TERROR.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:05.061 region:rollup2
WAS THE MOST SEMINAL EXPERIENCE

01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:07.963 region:rollup2
OF MY LIFE.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:09.365 region:rollup2
IT ALSO GREATLY AFFECTED ME.

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:10.1000 region:rollup2
I WAS IN COMBAT ALL THE WAY UP

01:16:09.365 --> 01:16:12.201 region:rollup2
UNTIL THE WEEK I FLEW HOME. AND

01:16:10.1000 --> 01:16:13.903 region:rollup2
I COULD NOT GET THE WAR OUT OF

01:16:12.201 --> 01:16:15.137 region:rollup2
MY HEAD.

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:18.140 region:rollup2
IT WAS LIKE IT PLAYED LIKE A

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:19.809 region:rollup2
MOVIE INSIDE MY HEAD NONSTOP.

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:21.744 region:rollup2
CONSTANT REOCCURRING IMAGES OF

01:16:19.809 --> 01:16:23.312 region:rollup2
DEAD CHILDREN HAUNTED ME. I WAS

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:24.914 region:rollup2
HYPER VIGILANT AT ALL TIMES I

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:26.882 region:rollup2
WAS ALWAYS ANGRY I COULDN'T

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.917 region:rollup2
SLEEP I WAS DEPRESSED.

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:30.019 region:rollup2
AND IT FELT LIKE THE WAR WAS

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:32.188 region:rollup2
LIKE A LEAD BLANKET LYING ON TOP

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:34.323 region:rollup2
OF ME SUFFOCATING ME.

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:35.724 region:rollup2
IT WAS AS IF MY BODY WAS HOME

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:38.127 region:rollup2
BUT MY MIND AND SPIRIT WERE

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:39.829 region:rollup2
STILL IN IRAQ.

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:41.664 region:rollup2
I COULDN'T ESCAPE THIS PAIN AND

01:16:39.829 --> 01:16:42.765 region:rollup2
ONE NIGHT I DECIDED THE ONLY WAY

01:16:41.664 --> 01:16:44.667 region:rollup2
TO BE FREE FROM IT WAS TO TAKE

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:46.268 region:rollup2
MY LIFE.

01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:47.736 region:rollup2
I SELF MEDICAID WITH A BOTTLE OF

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.704 region:rollup2
JACK DANIELS AND SET MY LIVING

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:50.172 region:rollup2
ROOM WITH A LOADED GLOCK PISTOL

01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:53.476 region:rollup2
IN MY MOUTH.

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:55.244 region:rollup2
I STARTED TO PULL THE TRIGGER.

01:16:53.476 --> 01:16:56.245 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T THAT I WANTED TO DIE.

01:16:55.244 --> 01:16:59.181 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST THAT I COULDN'T BEAR

01:16:56.245 --> 01:17:00.916 region:rollup2
LIVING ANYMORE.

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:02.518 region:rollup2
SOMETHING STOPPED ME AND THE

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:05.120 region:rollup2
NEXT DAY I WANT TO THE OAKLAND

01:17:02.518 --> 01:17:06.722 region:rollup2
BUT CENTER AND I GOT HELP.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.990 region:rollup2
I RELUCTANTLY ADMIT THAT AT

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:09.792 region:rollup2
TIMES IT FEELS AS IF THE WAR

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:11.093 region:rollup2
BROKE ME.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:13.062 region:rollup2
THERE IS A LOSS OF INNOCENCE

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:14.563 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN NEVER GET BACK.

01:17:13.062 --> 01:17:16.365 region:rollup2
I WAS EXTREMELY PROUD TO DEFEND

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:18.334 region:rollup2
OUR GREAT NATION AND I WOULD DO

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:19.869 region:rollup2
IT AGAIN WITHOUT HESITATION.

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:21.670 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR WAR

01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:24.106 region:rollup2
FIGHTERS ARE NOT MACHINES.

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:26.275 region:rollup2
WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS AND WAR IS

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:27.209 region:rollup2
NOT AN ACTUAL HUMAN ENDEAVOR.

01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:28.911 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU SPEND A YEAR OF YOUR

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:30.913 region:rollup2
LIFE OF PEOPLE ACTIVELY TRYING

01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:34.183 region:rollup2
TO KILL YOU EVERY DAY.

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:35.451 region:rollup2
IT CAN TAKE A TOLL ON YOUR SOUL.

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:37.553 region:rollup2
SO FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS I

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:39.388 region:rollup2
TRIED EVERYTHING. I COULD EVERY

01:17:37.553 --> 01:17:41.323 region:rollup2
FORM OF THERAPY. TO BECOME WHOLE

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:42.791 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:43.626 region:rollup2
I BATTLE WITH DEPRESSION AT

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:46.962 region:rollup2
TIMES I WAS OVERCOME WITH

01:17:43.626 --> 01:17:48.864 region:rollup2
DESPAIR.

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:50.266 region:rollup2
THAT I FOUND DIABLO THAT FOR THE

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:52.568 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME IN A DECADE I FINALLY

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:54.036 region:rollup2
BEEN AT PEACE.

01:17:52.568 --> 01:17:56.539 region:rollup2
DIABLO TAKES VETERANS ON AN

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:58.107 region:rollup2
INTENSE JOURNEY LIKE NO WHETHER

01:17:56.539 --> 01:17:59.542 region:rollup2
IT'S A JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY. A

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:00.442 region:rollup2
JOURNEY OF FACING YOUR DEMONS IN

01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:02.645 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT NO OTHER FORM OF

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:04.046 region:rollup2
THERAPY CAN.

01:18:02.645 --> 01:18:06.015 region:rollup2
A MODEL OF EXPLORING MOVEMENT

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:07.950 region:rollup2
AND DANCE.

01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:09.351 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY THAT FREES US HAS

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:10.619 region:rollup2
ENABLED ME TO LET GO OF MY ANGER

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:12.054 region:rollup2
SEE THE BEAUTY IN MYSELF AND

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:13.355 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:15.991 region:rollup2
AND HAS PROVIDED ME THE TOOLS TO

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:17.726 region:rollup2
LIVE A POSITIVE PRODUCTIVE LIFE.

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:19.094 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY DIABLO USES A MODEL

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:21.096 region:rollup2
THAT REPLICATES THE SENSE OF

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:22.865 region:rollup2
TRIBE. THAT MANY VETERANS LONG

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:24.934 region:rollup2
TO HAVE AGAIN.

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:26.101 region:rollup2
IT THEN BUILDS ON THE TRUST THAT

01:18:24.934 --> 01:18:28.103 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WITHIN THIS COMMUNITY

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:30.039 region:rollup2
AND CHALLENGES US.

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:30.973 region:rollup2
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY IN WAYS

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:32.741 region:rollup2
THAT MAKE US REALIZE THE

01:18:30.973 --> 01:18:33.976 region:rollup2
BARRIERS.

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:35.945 region:rollup2
BUT IF SHACKLED OUR LIVES ARE

01:18:33.976 --> 01:18:37.646 region:rollup2
MERELY ILLUSIONS AND THAT WE

01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:40.182 region:rollup2
HAVE THE POWER. AND RESILIENCY

01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:40.983 region:rollup2
TO OVERCOME THEM.

01:18:40.182 --> 01:18:42.585 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ONLY A COUPLE TIMES IN

01:18:40.983 --> 01:18:43.953 region:rollup2
MY LIFE.

SADLY.

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:52.688 region:rollup2
THE INSANITY OF WAR IS STILL A

01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:51.419 region:rollup2
.

01:29:49.684 --> 01:29:52.787 region:rollup2
I DISCOVERED ACTING AS A FORM OF

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:54.522 region:rollup2
CATHARSIS TO DEAL WITH SOME OF

01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:56.691 region:rollup2
MY ISSUES COMING BACK FOR MORE.

01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:58.059 region:rollup2

TO PARTNER WITH THEM AND DO A

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:18.446 region:rollup2
JOINT PRODUCTION AS A MEANS OF

01:30:17.545 --> 01:30:20.282 region:rollup2
BRINGING THE TWO GROUPS TOGETHER

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:22.417 region:rollup2
TO HEAL.

01:30:20.282 --> 01:30:24.085 region:rollup2
AND GREAT IDEA BUT THERE WAS NO

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:26.354 region:rollup2
MEANS TO GET IT DONE.

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:27.822 region:rollup2
SO FIGURES LATER AYE I FORMED MY

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:29.758 region:rollup2
OWN THEATRE COMPANY WARRIORS FOR

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:31.693 region:rollup2
PEACE THEATER. AND HAS BASICALLY

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:34.262 region:rollup2
TWO FOLD MISSION ONE WE USE

01:30:31.693 --> 01:30:35.764 region:rollup2
SHAKESPEARE THERE AS A FORM OF

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:38.166 region:rollup2
CATHARSIS ARE VETERANS.

01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:40.802 region:rollup2
AND THE THE LARGER GOAL THE NEXT

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:43.038 region:rollup2
PHASE TO BRING.

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:44.072 region:rollup2
BUT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.

01:30:43.038 --> 01:30:45.774 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WITH VETERANS FROM OUR

01:30:44.072 --> 01:30:47.442 region:rollup2
KIND AND DO A JOINT PRODUCTION

01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:49.110 region:rollup2
AS A MEANS OF HEALING AND

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:51.613 region:rollup2
BUILDING P..

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:53.114 region:rollup2
I'M TALKING SPECIFICALLY.

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:54.149 region:rollup2
VETERAN VETERANS FROM COUNTRY

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:56.518 region:rollup2
EITHER BEEN AT WAR WITH OUR HAVE

01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:59.187 region:rollup2
TOP RELATIONS WITH. THE IDEA

01:30:56.518 --> 01:31:01.056 region:rollup2
HERE IS THAT IF WE THE VETERANS

01:30:59.187 --> 01:31:02.824 region:rollup2
WHO FOUGHT THESE WARS CAN COME

01:31:01.056 --> 01:31:05.160 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IN PEACE THEN WHY CAN'T

01:31:02.824 --> 01:31:06.995 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY ELSE. IN MY PHILOSOPHY

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:08.730 region:rollup2
IS ARTS TRANSCENDS POLITICS AND

01:31:06.995 --> 01:31:10.298 region:rollup2
BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER.

01:31:08.730 --> 01:31:11.099 region:rollup2
AND SO NOW WE ARE WE'VE BEEN WE

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:13.301 region:rollup2
WERE DOING.

01:31:11.099 --> 01:31:15.470 region:rollup2
WORKSHOPS WHERE PEOPLE COME

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:17.539 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND EXPLORE SHAKESPEARE

01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:19.674 region:rollup2
AND IT PROVED TO BE A PROFOUNDLY

01:31:17.539 --> 01:31:20.842 region:rollup2
HEALING CATHARTIC EXPERIENCE.

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:23.078 region:rollup2
TO GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES IN

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:24.846 region:rollup2
RECENT.

01:31:23.078 --> 01:31:26.247 region:rollup2
I HAVE. PRIVACY DONORS PLAYS

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:26.915 region:rollup2
WITH PARTICULAR GROUPS VETERANS

01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:29.417 region:rollup2
SURE.

01:31:26.915 --> 01:31:32.253 region:rollup2
WELL WHERE WE CURRENTLY ARE.

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:33.888 region:rollup2
AND PRODUCTION PRE PRODUCTION

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:35.757 region:rollup2
TO DO A FILM ADAPTATION OF

01:31:33.888 --> 01:31:37.759 region:rollup2
JULIUS CAESAR.

01:31:35.757 --> 01:31:38.493 region:rollup2
AND AT AND A STAGE PRODUCTION AS

01:31:37.759 --> 01:31:40.762 region:rollup2
WELL IN FACT AND WE TO BE

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:42.297 region:rollup2
COLLABORATING WITH DIABLO TO ADD

01:31:40.762 --> 01:31:43.732 region:rollup2
SOME DANCE PIECES INTO IT WHAT

01:31:42.297 --> 01:31:45.233 region:rollup2
JULIUS CAESAR AMONG OTHER THINGS

01:31:43.732 --> 01:31:47.936 region:rollup2
A STORY ABOUT WAR TO WORRY ABOUT

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:48.470 region:rollup2
THE TRAIL AND ASSASSINATION AND.

01:31:47.936 --> 01:31:50.605 region:rollup2
LOSS AND.

01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:52.340 region:rollup2
IT.

01:31:50.605 --> 01:31:53.742 region:rollup2
OUR COUNTRY'S BEEN WAR FOR

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:55.510 region:rollup2
ALMOST SEVENTEEN YEARS AND HIS

01:31:53.742 --> 01:31:57.779 region:rollup2
OF THIS IS ABOUT PLAY ABOUT WAR

01:31:55.510 --> 01:32:00.148 region:rollup2
SO MY FOR MY THINKING IS WHAT WE

01:31:57.779 --> 01:32:01.483 region:rollup2
MODERNIZE IT. AND CAST A LOT OF

01:32:00.148 --> 01:32:02.951 region:rollup2
VETERANS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED

01:32:01.483 --> 01:32:04.219 region:rollup2
THESE WARS BECAUSE WHAT THEY CAN

01:32:02.951 --> 01:32:05.253 region:rollup2
BRING.

01:32:04.219 --> 01:32:06.955 region:rollup2
TO THAT IS INCREDIBLE THE

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:09.557 region:rollup2
BREADTH OF UNDERSTANDING OF

01:32:06.955 --> 01:32:10.959 region:rollup2
HAVING EXPERIENCED COMBAT IN WAR

01:32:09.557 --> 01:32:13.128 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT NOT EVERYBODY

01:32:10.959 --> 01:32:14.496 region:rollup2
CAN DO. WE ALSO WANT TO

01:32:13.128 --> 01:32:16.698 region:rollup2
MODERNIZE IT AND BENT.

01:32:14.496 --> 01:32:17.832 region:rollup2
GENDER MEN SOME ROLES.

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:18.767 region:rollup2
AND GIVE SOME OF THE MORE

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:21.269 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL ROLES LIKE MARC

01:32:18.767 --> 01:32:22.871 region:rollup2
ANTHONY TO TWO WOMEN ACTORS.

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:24.806 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO HAVE A VERY

01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:26.441 region:rollup2
ETHNICALLY DIVERSE CAST.

01:32:24.806 --> 01:32:27.509 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WERE JUST

01:32:26.441 --> 01:32:29.043 region:rollup2
MODERNIZING IT AND IN MANY

01:32:27.509 --> 01:32:30.945 region:rollup2
POSITIVE WAYS.

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:32.947 region:rollup2
AND THAT ALL U. S. VETS IN THIS

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:34.716 region:rollup2

THAT IS NOT WHOLLY RELIANT ON

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:53.347 region:rollup2
DRUGS.

01:45:51.979 --> 01:45:55.649 region:rollup2
THE STUDIES ARE VERY USEFUL IN

01:45:53.347 --> 01:45:57.051 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING OUR GOAL OF LESS DRUG

THERAPY. ARE THE ONLY SOURCES OF

01:46:31.819 --> 01:46:35.689 region:rollup2
MEDICINE AVAILABLE. BUT VETERAN

01:46:33.921 --> 01:46:36.857 region:rollup2

THEIR TOURS OF DUTY IT WOULD

01:46:38.325 --> 01:46:41.595 region:rollup2
BENEFIT EVERYONE INVOLVED IF WE

CIVILIAN AND. HAVE.

02:11:54.673 --> 02:11:59.178 region:rollup2
NO MINIMAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHY.

02:11:57.977 --> 02:12:01.480 region:rollup2
OF IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A

02:11:59.178 --> 02:12:03.015 region:rollup2
VERY SMALL SUBSET MEANT OF ARE

02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:05.017 region:rollup2
POPULATION THAT ACTUALLY SERVE

02:12:03.015 --> 02:12:07.219 region:rollup2
RIGHT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE

EXAM AND HAVE HAD EXPERIENCES

02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:10.489 region:rollup2

PERHAPS THE EVEN THE ADULT THE.

02:12:12.925 --> 02:12:16.495 region:rollup2
THE IMAGINATION PERHAPS THAT

02:12:15.194 --> 02:12:17.430 region:rollup2
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT ABOUT

02:12:16.495 --> 02:12:19.398 region:rollup2
ANY DATE THEN DAY DON'T DON'T

GONE THROUGH THEY MAY FEEL THE

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:26.472 region:rollup2
CIVIL I WATCHED A MOVIE A PATH.

02:12:25.905 --> 02:12:26.705 region:rollup2
YEAH THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE

02:12:26.472 --> 02:12:27.306 region:rollup2
GOTTEN.

02:12:26.705 --> 02:12:28.607 region:rollup2
AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT

02:12:27.306 --> 02:12:29.375 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION THAT SO THAT.

02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:31.710 region:rollup2
LE SO THAT THE GENERAL SIDE

02:12:29.375 --> 02:12:33.813 region:rollup2
CIVILIAN COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDS

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:36.215 region:rollup2
WHAT WE VAST OF OUR SERVICE

02:12:33.813 --> 02:12:38.083 region:rollup2
MEMBERS AND OUR VETERANS EARNS

02:12:36.215 --> 02:12:39.552 region:rollup2
BILL TO COMMUNICATE THAT.

02:12:38.083 --> 02:12:41.520 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU ARE MAY BE THAT A

02:12:39.552 --> 02:12:42.922 region:rollup2
MECHANISM TO DO THAT IN THE WAY

02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:44.857 region:rollup2
THAT NAM.

02:12:42.922 --> 02:12:47.726 region:rollup2
THAT IS I DO WITHOUT LABELS

02:12:44.857 --> 02:12:50.095 region:rollup2
ABOUT NOBODY CONCEPTION SO.

02:12:47.726 --> 02:12:52.398 region:rollup2
INSTILLED IN NC DEAD LEAVES. THE

02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:55.201 region:rollup2
PATHWAY OF INVESTING IN THE

02:12:52.398 --> 02:12:57.002 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES. OVERALL WITHOUT

02:12:55.201 --> 02:12:59.205 region:rollup2
POLARIZING WITHOUT THE

02:12:57.002 --> 02:13:00.973 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT. LARGE BRINGS

02:12:59.205 --> 02:13:03.742 region:rollup2
EVERYONE LOOKS AT LIKE THE LOOK

02:13:00.973 --> 02:13:05.377 region:rollup2
AT VISUAL APPEALING ITEMS. OF

02:13:03.742 --> 02:13:07.813 region:rollup2
PAINTINGS SCULPTURES THREE

02:13:05.377 --> 02:13:10.850 region:rollup2
DIMENSIONAL WAR DANCE THEATER

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:11.984 region:rollup2
AND SO FORTH I THINK IF YOU COME

02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:13.986 region:rollup2
NEAR WITHOUT WORDS.

02:13:11.984 --> 02:13:15.521 region:rollup2
THINKING I THINK EVEN MUSIC AND

02:13:13.986 --> 02:13:17.656 region:rollup2
WRITTEN EXPRESSION AS WELL. I

02:13:15.521 --> 02:13:20.359 region:rollup2
JUST PIGGYBACK OFF THAT FOR MY

02:13:17.656 --> 02:13:21.827 region:rollup2
MY NUMBER. THAT'S OR WAITING FOR

02:13:20.359 --> 02:13:22.595 region:rollup2
WE WERE. WAITING FOR YOU. AND I

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:23.996 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S A PIGGYBACK OFF THAT

02:13:22.595 --> 02:13:26.131 region:rollup2
IS LIKE THE IDEA OF LIKE THE

02:13:23.996 --> 02:13:27.967 region:rollup2
WARM HAND OFTEN. I THINK TOO.

02:13:26.131 --> 02:13:29.535 region:rollup2
USING THE ARTS LIKE YOU SAID

02:13:27.967 --> 02:13:31.270 region:rollup2
THERE TOWARD THEIR TRANQUIL AND.

02:13:29.535 --> 02:13:31.503 region:rollup2
THEY ALLOW A DIFFERENT VENUE

02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:33.005 region:rollup2
USING.

02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:33.906 region:rollup2
METAPHORS AND PUTTING THINGS

02:13:33.005 --> 02:13:35.007 region:rollup2
INTO DIFFERENT FORMER

02:13:33.906 --> 02:13:36.809 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO THE

02:13:35.007 --> 02:13:38.310 region:rollup2
FAMILIES OF THE SERVICE MEMBERS

02:13:36.809 --> 02:13:40.379 region:rollup2
CAN HEAR THE BAND THEN IT AND

02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:40.546 region:rollup2
LEARN A DIFFERENT WAY I HAVE TO

02:13:40.379 --> 02:13:42.481 region:rollup2
SAY.

02:13:40.546 --> 02:13:44.717 region:rollup2
JUST THROUGH YOUR YOUR WORDS

02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:48.821 region:rollup2
TODAY I MEAN I WAS HOLDING BACK

02:13:44.717 --> 02:13:49.455 region:rollup2
TEARS I'VE HEARD THIS HOW MANY

02:13:48.821 --> 02:13:50.089 region:rollup2
TIMES AND IT STILL GETS ME BUT.

02:13:49.455 --> 02:13:50.990 region:rollup2
SOMETHING IN THE WAY THAT YOU

02:13:50.089 --> 02:13:52.658 region:rollup2
DID THAT REALLY MADE IT EASIER

02:13:50.990 --> 02:13:54.860 region:rollup2
NOT EASY FOR ME BUT EASIER TED

02:13:52.658 --> 02:13:58.163 region:rollup2
SORRY. EASIER TO DIGEST.

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:59.832 region:rollup2
THAT VARY A SOMBER I EXPERIENCE

02:13:58.163 --> 02:14:02.067 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK JUST USING THE

02:13:59.832 --> 02:14:04.236 region:rollup2
ARTS IN A WAY WE CAN PUT REALLY.

02:14:02.067 --> 02:14:06.372 region:rollup2
HARDER LESS BENIGN.

02:14:04.236 --> 02:14:08.173 region:rollup2
THINGS INTO CONTEXT IN A WAY

02:14:06.372 --> 02:14:10.175 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE DIGESTED BY THE

02:14:08.173 --> 02:14:12.645 region:rollup2
GENERAL PUBLIC.

02:14:10.175 --> 02:14:14.613 region:rollup2
