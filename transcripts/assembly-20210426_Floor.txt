HOUSE RESOLUTION TWENTY ONE BY SOMEONE IS ERIN RELATIVE TO THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. MISTER NAZARIAN EMAIL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER TODAY I RISE FOR SIGNIFICANT OCCASION I'VE RISEN IN THIS CHAMBER FOR THIS OCCASION FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS SINCE JOINING THIS BODY. A PROUD DESCENDANT OF GENOCIDE SURVIVORS I STAND HERE IN COMMEMORATION OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE HR TWENTY ONE. OVER A CENTURY AGO OTTOMAN RULERS USED ARMENIA PHOBIA AS A DISTRACTION DURING DOMESTIC STRIFE. THE SLOWLY DYING AUTUMN IN TURKEY IN CONJUNCTION WITH AZERBAIJANI TRIBES INITIATED ETHNIC CLEANSING CAMPAIGNS AND THE FIRST MAJOR GENOCIDE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. THE EMPIRE MURDERED THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ASSYRIANS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GREEKS. AND OVER A CIVILIANS WERE RAPED TORTURED POISONED BURNED ALIVE SHOT THOSE WHO SURVIVED WERE FORCED TO CONVERT. OR MARCH AND BE DEPORTED INTO THE HEART OF THE SYRIAN DESERT WHERE THEY FACED EXTREME HEAT HUNGER. SAVAGE ANIMALS AND CONCENTRATION CAMPS. MY GRANDPARENTS ESCAPED AS THEIR HOME TOWN OF SHUSHI IN ARTS OFF WAS BURNED DOWN TO THE GROUND. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NEVER HELD THE PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE AFTER WORLD WAR ONE TURKEY FAILED TO SO MUCH AS TO APOLOGIZE LET ALONE PAY REPARATIONS TO THE FAMILIES OF THE PEOPLE KILLED AND MURDERED. THIS IS ONLY EMBOLDENED BULLIES AROUND THE WORLD IN THE LAST CENTURY TO FURTHER CONTINUE THEIR UNSPEAKABLE HORRORS WHETHER IT BE HITLER POL POT OR OTHERS. A CENTURY LATER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST PANDEMIC IN A HUNDRED YEARS. AND WHILE IT WAS ALREADY SUFFERING FROM WORST THE WORST COVERED RATES IN THE WORLD ARMENIA WAS HORRIFIC LEE ATTACKED BY TURKEY AND AZERBAIJAN. ATTEMPTING TO FURTHER CONTINUE AN ETHNICALLY CLEANSE INDIGENOUS ARMENIANS FROM THEIR ANCESTRAL LANDS. TURKEY THE SECOND LARGEST NATO POWER DEPLOYED SYRIAN MERCENARIES TO ATTACK ARMENIANS. AND HELP UPGRADE AZERBAIJAN'S OFFENSIVE SYSTEM AS WELL. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL VERIFY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWO VIDEOS OF AZERBAIJANI TROOPS TORTURING AND DECAPITATING CAPTURED ARMENIANS AND MUTILATING THE BODIES OF ARMENIAN MEN WHO HAD FALLEN. IN ONE INSTANCE COLLEAGUES A AZERBAIJANI SOLDIER. USED A DEAD ARMENIAN SOLDIERS CELLPHONE CALLED HIS FAMILY. AND IT SHOWED THEM ON LIVE FACEBOOK LIVE VIDEO HOW HE IS THE CAPITATE BEING THAT THAT SOLDIER. THIS IS IN THE TWENTIETH SAID TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THIS IS LAST YEAR. LAST FALL. THE YEAR BEFORE THAT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I TRAVELED FROM. CALIFORNIA TO STEPANAKERT THE ARTS OF THE CAPITAL OF ARTS OFF TO ATTEND AN INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE CO SPONSORED BY ARMENIA AND ARTSAKH. THE BUILDING THAT HOSTED MYSELF SEVERAL OTHER CALIFORNIA. ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. WAS BOMBED BY AZERBAIJAN JUST LAST YEAR THE VERY BUILDING THAT HOSTED ALL OF US. A TINY INDIGENOUS COUNTRY LANDLOCKED BETWEEN TWO HOSTILE POWERS ARMENIA LOST FIVE THOUSAND SOLDIERS AND FIVE HUNDRED CIVILIANS LAST YEAR. TO PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE IMAGINE IF NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AMERICANS WERE KILLED IN A WAR IN THE MIDDLE OF COVERED NINETEEN IN A MATTER OF FORTY FOUR DAYS. NO ONE CAN BE SURPRISED WHEN THE ATTACK THE REGION'S ONLY THRIVING GROWING DEMOCRACY. EMBOLDENED BY A LACK OF REPERCUSSIONS TURKEY AND AZERBAIJAN CONTINUALLY SEEK NEW WAYS TO DESTROY THE INJURED THE INDIGENOUS ARMENIAN PEOPLE. THE GENOCIDE HAS NOT ENDED FOREIGN UNIONS GREEKS AND ASSYRIANS AS THEIR BELLIGERENT NEIGHBORS CONTINUE TO THREATEN THEIR EXISTENCE WITH COMMENTS SUCH AS AN AZERBAIJANI OFFICIALS SAYING. THEIR GOAL IS TO COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF ARMENIANS. AND AZERIS THE STATE SPOKESPERSON HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE NO STATE OF ARMENIA. OTHER BY JOHN HAS DESTROYED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF UNESCO PROTECTED ARMENIAN CROSS STONES. WHILE MANY OF US FIGHT FOR JUSTICE TURKEY HAS DRIVEN A CAMPAIGN OF DENIAL IT PUNISHES TURKISH CITIZEN ITS OWN CITIZENS WHO DARE TELL KNOWLEDGE THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN IN FACT IT HAS LAWS THAT IMPRISON ANYONE MAKING ANTI TURKISH COMMENTS. TURKEY THREATENS OTHER COUNTRIES FROM ACKNOWLEDGING THE GENOCIDE IT USES A DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN TO CONFUSE THE HISTORICAL RECORD. HISTORICAL CONSENSUS IS CLEAR THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE HAPPENED AND TURKEY WAS THE PERPETRATOR. THE AUTUMN EMPIRE SEIZE NEARLY ALL ARMENIAN PROPERTIES THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF WHICH AMOUNTS TO TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ON THE EVE OF WORLD WAR ONE IN ADDITION TO PRIVATE PROPERTY ARMENIANS LIVING IN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE OWNED TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY CHURCHES. FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY ONE MONASTERIES. ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY SIX SCHOOLS. BY THE END OF THE WAR ONLY SIX CHURCHES REMAIN STANDING. TODAY EASTERN TURKEY KNOWN AS WESTERN ARMENIA. IS WIDELY UNINHABITED FILLED WITH ROOMS OF ARMENIAN CHURCHES AND SCHOOLS. TURKEY OWES ITS STATUS AS A GLOBAL SUPERPOWER TO THE WEALTH IT STOLE FROM ITS ARMENIAN POPULATION. IN HIS OBERSALZBERG SPEECH A WEEK BEFORE THE INVASION OF POLAND. HITLER ASKED HIS NERVOUS **** COMMANDERS WHO AFTER ALL SPEAKS TODAY OF THE ANNIHILATION OF THE ARMENIANS. HITLER WAS DIRECTLY INSPIRED BY THE YOUNG TURKS. WHO CARRIED OUT THE SAME CRIME ONLY THIRTY YEARS PRIOR. SINCE THEN GENOCIDE HAS OCCURRED OFTEN AND UNOPPOSED RWANDA CAMBODIA BOSNIA DOOR FOR THE LIST GOES ON. YOU LIVE WITH SELL SAID NEVER AGAIN. BECOMES MORE THAN A SLOGAN IT'S A PRAYER IT'S A PROMISE A VOW. NEVER AGAIN THE GLORIFICATION OF BASS UGLY DARK VIOLENCE. OUR HOPE IS THAT NEVER AGAIN DO WE HAVE TO SAY NEVER AGAIN. WE MUST ALL WORK TO PROTECT ONE ANOTHER AND STOP THE CYCLE OF GENOCIDE. TODAY I AM NO LONGER ABLE TO TRAVEL TO VISIT MY HOME ROUTES AND SHUSHI ARTS OF. HERE'S AGO WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS VERY CHAMBER. I TRAVEL TO ARE TOUGH AND ATTEMPTED TO FIND THE GRAVES OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS. LOCALS BOTH LOCALS AS WELL AS LOCAL OFFICIALS TOLD ME THAT. WHEN AZERBAIJAN CONTROLLED THAT REGION DURING THE SOVIET ERA. THEY DESTROYED MANY ARMENIAN CEMETERIES AND GRAVES. THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT DIE WILL NOT DIE. THAT'S THE ONE THOUGHT I WANNA LEAVE WITH ALL OF YOU FOLKS BECAUSE- THERE WAS A MASS ATTEMPT TO MURDER AN ENTIRE POPULATION. BUT WE STAND. DR MARIJA TOOT ONCE SAID HOME IS NOT WHERE MY GRANDPARENTS ARE BURIED BUT WHERE MY GRAND CHILDREN ARE RAISED. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE THIRD LARGEST ARMENIAN COMMUNITY IN THE WORLD. THREE GENERATIONS OF MY FAMILY HAVE LIVED IN FOUR DIFFERENT PARTS. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST HUNDRED AND TEN YEARS BEFORE FINALLY SETTLING IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS MOTIVATED ME TO RUN FOR OFFICE. I WANT TO SHOW MY KIDS THAT CALIFORNIA IS THEIR HOME WE WILL NOT FLEE WE WILL NOT RUN WE WILL NOT HIDE. WE WILL NOT MOVE. WE ARE HERE TO STAY AND I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT THE FORTY SIXTH DISTRICT IN LOS ANGELES AND IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. THANK. THANK EMISSIONS AREA MR HOLDEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS I'M HONORED TO RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AND CONSTITUENTS BUT I SUPPORT. IN SUPPORT OF HR TWENTY ONE. TODAY WE RECOGNIZE THE HUNDRED AND SIX ANNIVERSARY. THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE A TRAGEDY THAT HAS GONE UNRECOGNIZED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR FAR TOO LONG. BUT NOW WE'RE AT A TURNING POINT. THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH ON SATURDAY SHOWS THE LEADERSHIP MANY OF THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FROM THEIR ADOPTED COUNTRY. AS PRESIDENT BY AND PUT IT IN A STATEMENT. OVER THE DECADES ARMENIAN AMERICANS AND ARMENIAN IMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN RESCUED NINE STATES AND COUNTLESS WAYS BUT THEY HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN THE TRAGIC HISTORY THAT BROUGHT SO MANY OF THEIR ANCESTORS TO OUR SHORES. WE ARE FIRM THEIR HISTORY. FROM THE MIDDLE PASSAGE TO JIM CROW THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IDENTIFIES WITH THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY IN THE PAYING. SUFFERING AND DEATH INFLICTED UPON OUR PEOPLE FOR NO OTHER REASON BUT HATE. WHICH INDEED IS POISON TO THE SOUL. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER ON THIS ISSUE FOR MANY YEARS AND I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM VAN NUYS FOR BEING A TIRELESS ADVOCATE AND REPRESENTATIVE FOR HIS COMMUNITY. AS WE COMMEMORATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGEDY WE MUST REMEMBER. THAT IN A SENSE. THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE DID NOT IN. IT CONTINUES TODAY. GENOCIDE SCHOLAR GREGORY STAN PUTS IT BEST WHEN HE SAYS THE NILE IS THE LAST STAGE OF GENOCIDE. TURKEY NOT ONLY DENIES THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE BUT CONTINUES TO ENGAGE IN ONGOING WELL FUNDED CAMPAIGN TO DENY THE GENOCIDE AND BLAME THE VICTIMS FOR WHAT HAPPENED. WITHOUT FACING ANY ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PAST ACTIONS TURKEY CONTINUES TO FEEL ANTI ARMENIAN VIOLENCE DOMESTICALLY AND IN AZERBAIJAN. INCLUDING BANKROLLING TERRORIST MERCENARIES FOR AZERBAIJAN'S WAR AGAINST ARMENIAN CONTROLLED NAGORNO KARABAKH REPUBLIC. FOR MANY FAMILIES WHO LOST PARENTS. GRANDPARENTS AND FRIENDS IN THE GENOCIDE THE CURRENT CONFLICT IS MORE THAN SALT IN THE WOUND IT IS A NICE. THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST BUT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO STOP THE AGGRESSION AGAINST ARMENIANS TODAY. EVEN IF IT'S JUST RAISING OUR VOICE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK I THINK ARE CALLINGAND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MR HOLDEN MS FRIEDMAN. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

AS JEWS WE FEEL A VERY CLOSE KINSHIP WITH THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS BOTH PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED WITHIN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY GENOCIDES. BUT WHEREAS THE JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT OF MOST OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD RECOGNIZING THAT THEHOLOCAUST OCCURRED IT HAPPENED SO RECENTLY THAT IT'S- DIFFICULT TO DENY IT. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD TRY EVEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE. THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE ON THE OTHER HAND HAS BEEN DENIED. HAS BEEN DISCOUNTED. UNTIL VERY RECENTLY. INCLUDING HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. JUST THIS SATURDAY JOE BIDEN CALLED THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE FOR WHAT IT IS A GENOCIDE THE FIRST MODERN PRESIDENT. IN HISTORY TO DO SO. I CAN'T TELL YOU THE AMOUNT OF RELIEF. THAT MY ONSTITUENTS HAD IN THAT MOMENT IT WAS LIKE A COLLECTIVE SIGH. A GUN ACROSS THE COMMUNITIES OF BURBANK AND GLENDALE PEOPLE SAID FINALLY A U. S. PRESIDENT IS ADMITTING THAT WE INDEED SUFFERED GENOCIDE. BUT I MUST ALSO TELL YOU MEMBERS BUT THAT IS TEMPERED BY THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF PAIN THAT THIS COMMUNITY HAS SUFFERED IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. WITH THE ATTACKS ON ARTSAKH. IN ARMENIA. THE AMOUNT OF DESPAIR OF ANGUISH OF THREAT A VIOLATION THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SO TRAUMATIZED THROUGH DIASPORA THROUGH WAR THROUGH GENOCIDE WITHIN RECENT REMEMBRANCE OF RELATIVES AND THE FEELING. THAT-PERHAPS HISTORY WAS ABOUT TO REPEAT ITSELF. HOW MY FRIEND FROM VAN NUYS. THE CHAIR OF THE ARMENIAN CAUCUS OF WHICH I AM PROUD TO BE A MEMBER SPOKE SO ELOQUENTLY AND SO POWERFULLY ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS. TO THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE. BUT I ASK YOU ALL THAT AS WE RECOGNIZE THE GENOCIDE TODAY AND WHEN WE SAY% NEVER AGAIN TO ALSO REMEMBER THAT THAT MEANS STANDING UP TODAY. AGAINST WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN ARMENIA. A PUSHING OUR ALLIES PUSHING OUR OWN GOVERNMENT TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE STAND TO PREVENT CONTINUED AGGRESSION CONTINUED WAR CONTINUE MURDER OF THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE. NOW ARE CALLING FROM VAN NUYS DID BRING ME TO ARMENIA AND ARTSAKH A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. UNTIL YOU WALK IN ARTSAKH AND FEEL AND SEE FOR YOURSELF. THE LAYERS OF GENERATIONS AFTER GENERATIONS OF ARMENIAN HISTORY THAT IS WOVEN INTO THAT COUNTRY THE ENGINE ARMENIAN WORDS. THAT GOING BACK AS FAR AS A FOR CENTURY WERE CARVED INTO CHURCHES AND MONASTERIES THE C. THE GRAVEYARDS. ONLY THEN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE INCREDIBLE CONNECTION THAT THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE HAVE TO THAT REGION IT IS OUR ANCESTRAL HOMELAND AND JUST WITHIN THE LAST YEAR. TO SEE INNOCENT ARMENIAN BLOOD SPILLED ON ARMENIAN CROPS IN ARMENIAN CHURCHES AND ARMENIAN HOMES. ONLY THEN CAN YOU REALIZE THE THREAT THAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS VERY SMALL. NATION TRYING TO REINVENT ITSELF SO I ASK YOU TODAY IS WE SAY NEVER AGAIN I RECOGNIZE THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE TO ALSO COMMIT TO TAKING A STAND.

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO A VIBRANT ARMENIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THE LARGEST DIASPORA COMMUNITY IN THE WORLD. THIS COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO BE HEAVILY AFFECTED BY AGGRESSION HATE AND WAR CRIMES. IN OUR STATE THE SAN FRANCISCO ARMENIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY WAS SUBJECTED TO HATE CRIMES WHEN THE KZTV ARMENIAN SCHOOL WAS VANDALIZED AND LATER THE ST GREGORY THE ILLUMINATOR ARMENIAN APOSTOLATE CHURCHES CENTER WAS FACED WITH AN ARSON ATTACK. INTERNATIONALLY THIS COMMUNITY WAS IMPACTED BY THE UNPROVOKED ATTACKS ON THE REPUBLIC OF ARTS OCT BY AZERBAIJAN. TURKEY ENCOURAGED AND SUPPORTED THESE UNPROVOKED ATTACKS AGAINST ARMENIAN PEOPLE AND WE CANNOT EMBOLDEN THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT TO COMMIT FURTHER CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. WE MUST SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT CALIFORNIA CONDEMNS THE DENIAL OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE THE ONGOING AGGRESSION AT HOME AND ABROAD AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF ARTSAKH. CALIFORNIA HAS A PROUD HISTORY AND STRONG RECORD OF CONDEMNING JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE GOVERNOR DEUKMEJIAN CONDEMNED SOUTH AFRICA'S APARTHEID APARTHEID POLICY AND FIND A DIVERTISSEMENT BILL. GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER SIGNED A SEDAN DEVELOPMENT THOUGH DUE TO THE ONGOING GENOCIDE IN DARFUR. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IS A STATE WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO CONDEMN VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE DENIAL OF GENOCIDE.

AND MORE THAN SURVIVAL THRIVING. SO WITH THAT HEY THANK ALL OF YOU AND HUMBLY ASKED FOR THE FIRST ROLE TO BE OPENED FOR COLLECTORS THANK YOU. THANK EMISSIONS- AND WITH THAT THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS. AUTHORS ON THE RESOLUTION THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS. THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS AT HR TWENTY ONE. THE CLERK WILL. CLOSER ALL THEIR SEVENTY FIVE CO AUTHORS ADDED WITHOUT OBJECTION WE MAY TAKE A VOICE VOTE ON THE HOUSE RESOLUTION ALL THOSE IN FAVOR SAY AYE AYE OPPOSED SAY NAY. THE EYES HAVE IT THE RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED. THIS IS FILE ITEM FIFTY THREE. HR THIRTY EIGHT BY MISS CARILLO CORKERY. HOUSE RESOLUTION THIRTY EIGHT BY SUMMER CARILLO RELATIVE TO SEXUAL ASSAULT. MYSTERY OF. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER NUMBERS TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT HR THIRTY EIGHT WHICH RECOGNIZES APRIL AS SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH AND APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH AS DENIM DAY IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE ITALIAN SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED THE CONVICTION OF A MAN WHO SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD YOUNG WOMAN BECAUSE SHE WAS WEARING QUOTE. VERY TIGHT JEANS IN THE MIDST OF IN THE MINDS OF THE OF THE MALE JURIES THAT MEANT TO. PERHAPS THE- THAT THE WOMAN HELP REMOVED IN THE MINDS OF THE MALE JURIST- THEIR DECISION WAS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT THIS YOUNG WOMAN REMOVED HER OWN JEANS. EXTRADITING EXTENDING THIS AGREE JUST LOGIC WHAT FOLLOWED WAS NO LONGER RATE BUT INSTEAD CONSENSUAL THE OUTRAGEOUS AND OFFENSIVE NATURE OF THIS VERDICT TRIGGERED AN INTERNATIONAL CALL TO ACTION AND SINCE THAT TIME WEARING DENIM ON THIS DAY SERVES AS BOTH. AN ACT OF PROTEST AND ANNOUNCEMENT OF ALL THE ACTIONS THAT SEEK TO SILENCE VICTIMS AND A SYMBOL OF ALLYSHIP AND SOLIDARITY. WITH SURVIVOR WITH SURVIVORS PEOPLE FROM EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC AND BACKGROUND ARM HEART ARE HARMED BY SEXUAL VIOLENCE BUT IT IMPACTS WOMEN AT A HIGHER RATE. ONE IN FIVE MEN EXPERIENCE SOME SORT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THEIR LIFETIME BUT FOR WOMEN IT'S ONE INTO. THE IMPACT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT LAST LONGER THAN THE HARMFUL ACT TAKES PLACE IN ADDITION TO THE IMMEDIATE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL COST SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS. REGULARLY SUFFER FROM SEVERE AND LONG LASTING CONSEQUENCES THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER MAY ALSO GRAPPLE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE DEPRESSION HOMELESSNESS AND EATING DISORDER ATTEMPTS AT SELF HARM INCLUDING ATTEMPTS TO TAKE ONE'S OWN LIFE. THIS IS WHY THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION HAVE IDENTIFIED SEXUAL ASSAULT AND RAPE CULTURE THAT ENABLED ENABLE IT AS PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A NATIONAL LEADER SETTING THE STANDARD FOR AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT PROMOTING APPROACHES WITHIN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS THAT DO MORE. THAN SEND TO THE NEEDS OF SURVIVORS AND PROVIDING COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO EMPOWER THEMSELVES TO INTERVENE TO PREVENT ASSAULT. AS ACTIVE BYSTANDERS. THE BAD NEWS IS OUR WORK FAR FROM FINISHED CALIFORNIA HAD FOUR TOP FOURTEEN THOUSAND. EIGHT HUNDRED REPORTED RAPE CASES IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AGAIN THAT'S. FOURTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED REPORTED RAPE CASES IN TWENTY NINETEEN. RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT ARE ALSO UNDER REPORTED CRIMES WHICH MEANS THE NUMBER OF SURVIVORS IS ACTUALLY MUCH HIGHER AND WE KNOW THAT AMID THE PULPIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THOSE NUMBERS HAVE ONLY INCREASED. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SEXUAL ASSAULTS ARE COMMITTED BY SOMEONE THE SURVIVOR NEW NOT A STRANGER. YET THE KNEE JERK RESPONSE SURVIVORS HERE REMAIN TO BE THE SAME QUESTIONS LIKE. WHAT WERE YOU WEARING WERE YOU DRINKING THE TO LEAVE THEM ON. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT WEARING JEANS OR ANYTHING ELSE IS NEVER AN INVITATION. TO RAPE NO MEANS NO. INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE IS UNACCEPTABLE IT IS EVERYONE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO STOP ASSAULT AND THE RAPE CULTURE THAT ENABLES IT WHAT WE NEED IS A SOCIETAL SHIFT IN CULTURE. IN WHICH BOYS AND MEN OUR ALLIES WERE BOYS AND MEN ARE TAUGHT THAT RAPE IS WRONG AND THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT IS WRONG. RATHER THAN THE ISSUE WARNINGS TO GIRLS AND WOMEN AND HOW THEY CAN AVOID BEING ASSAULTED. WE NEED A CULTURE OF WHICH NO ONE FEELS UNSAFE ON THE JOB AT SCHOOL OR AT HOME. ONE IN WHICH SURVIVORS REGARDLESS OF INCOME RACE CULTURE GENDER IDENTITY DISABILITY LANGUAGE OR IMMIGRATION STATUS FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD AND RECEIVING THE HEALTH CARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND OTHER SUPPORT. THEY NEED ONCE THEY DO. ONE IN WHICH PERPETRATORS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WITHOUT ATTACKING THE CHARACTER AND THE REPUTATION OF THE SURVIVORS. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES FOR WEARING DENIM TODAY. WE ALL HAVE MOTHERS SISTERS DAUGHTERS WHO WISH TO PROTECT AND WE WERE DONE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ELEVATING THE CONVERSATION AND BRINGING AWARENESS. THAT NO ITEM OF CLOTHING SIGNALS AN INVITATION FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT. MEMBERS TRADITIONALLY WE WOULD HAVE ACTIONS ON THE CAPITOL GROUNDS BUT DUE TO COVER THIS RESOLUTION IS OUR ONE AND ONLY ACTION FOR THIS YEAR. YOU ARE ALSO WELCOME TO WEAR JEANS ON WEDNESDAY WITH HIS DENIM DAY I WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS VALOR CALIFORNIA.
