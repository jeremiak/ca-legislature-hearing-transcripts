AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- LET ME JUST SAY IN. A YEARS PASSED THE SELECT COMMITTEE HAS HEARD. EXPERT TESTIMONY ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURING FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AND THE IMPACT. BUT TRANSIT CONNECTIVITY ON OUR COMMUNITIES. TODAY WE WILL EXPLORE THESE PAST THEMES ARE CURRENT PLANS NEW IDEAS TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND THE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THEY BRING TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH EQUITY AND OUR ECONOMY. AS LEGISLATORS IT'S OUR DUTY TO SERVE THE LONG TERM INTERESTS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDING SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. THAT JUST THE THAT OPTIONS DOES JUST THAT BY ONE CREATING EFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES TO DRIVING AN INTERN REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED TO SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGIES THAT REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON DIRTY FOSSIL FUELS THREE. HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT OPTIONS REDUCE PERSONAL VEHICLE TRAFFIC ON ROADS AND HIGHWAYS AND IN TURN MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER TO NAVIGATE AND SHORTENING TRAVEL TIMES WHEN DRIVING IS NECESSARY FOR BOTH. TIMES IT ENSURE AFFORDED AND ACCESSIBILITY TO HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT MAKE CERTAIN THAT NO ONE IN OUR COMMUNITY IS BARRED FROM EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. AND FIVE PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE HELPS ENCOURAGE COMMUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION WALKING BIKING FOR SKATEBOARDING WHICH IS A SHOUT OUT TO THE MILLENNIALS. ARE ALL THE- EMISSION TRANSFER OPTIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED PUBLIC HEALTH. SINCE OUR LAST HEARING IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FUNDING FOR REGIONAL TRANSIT PROJECTS HAS BEEN SECURED AND WE CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD ACHIEVING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS A NOTABLE PROJECT AS THE MAYOR POINTED OUT IS THE FOOTHILL GOLD LINE. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FOOTHILL GOAL LINE REAL AUTHORITY HAS SECURED FUNDING TO REACH POMONA. ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE PROJECTS TERMINUS IN MONTCLAIR. ITS ROUTE ALONG THE TWO TEN FREEWAY HAS CREATED A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO DRIVING THUS REDUCING CONGESTION IN THIS CORRIDOR. THE GOAL LINE HAS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN CONNECTING THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY TO THE REST OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS OF DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE GOAL LINE SERVERS OVER FORTY THOUSAND TRIPS PER MONTH. AS A GOAL LINE EXTENSION PROJECT PRESSES FORWARD TO MIND CLEAR BERIA'S TO THE PROJECTS TIMELY COMPLETION. HAVE PRESENTED THEMSELVES. THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION SHORTFALL FROM POMONA TO MY CLEAR POSES A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. MY DISTRICT ENCOMPASSES TWO COUNTIES THE UNIQUE ISSUES AROUND FUNDING A PROJECT THAT CROSSES THE COUNTY LINE IS NOT NEW TO ME. BUT IT IS NOT AN ISSUE ONE COUNTY MUST FACE ALONE. STATE FUNDING SOURCES SUCH AS SOLUTIONS FOR CONGESTED CORRIDORS PROGRAM WHICH IS OUTLINED IN SB ONE AND THE TRANSIT IN INNER CITY REAL CAPITAL PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY G. R. F. FUNDING COMBINED WITH LOCAL FUNDING MEASURES PROVIDE A PROMISING OUTLOOK. ON THE FUTURE OF INTER COUNTY CONNECTIVITY. IN A REGIONAL CONNECTIVITY IS NOT ACHIEVED OVERNIGHT. THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THE GOAL LINE PROJECT KNOW THAT IT HAS COME THIS FAR BECAUSE OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN POLICYMAKERS PLANNERS ADVOCATES IN GOVERNING BODIES WE DID IT BECAUSE WE SAID WE KNOW WE CAN. MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO GET THIS CRUCIAL PROJECT COMPLETED. THE GOAL LINE PROJECT PROVIDES A PREVIEW OF A GREATER URBAN PLANNING VISION FOR OUR REGION. RAIL TO THE AIRPORT CONNECTIVITY. BEFORE I INVITE OUR FIRST PANEL THE TO BE SEATED I'D LIKE TO OFFER MY COLLEAGUES AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A FEW OPENING COMMENTS AS WELL AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN TO- MY A MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE AND GOOD FRIEND A SIMILAR RODRIGUEZ.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS AND GET THEM INTO MASS TRANSIT HOW DO WE GET THEM INTO RAIL- WE DO THAT BY MAKING IT EASY BY MAKING IT CONVENIENT AND BY MAKING IT. AFFORDABLE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CONVENING ALL OF US THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT WELL BEFORE I WAS ELECTED BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU I BRING YOU A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE- SOMETIMES AS ELECTED OFFICIALS WE WORK IN SILOS. BUT WE ARE NOW REALLY BREAKING THOSE SILOS DOWN I THINK IN SACRAMENTO. I HAVE ONE CITY THAT'S IN LA COUNTY THAT IS PROMOTED THE REST OF MY CITIES ARE IN SAM READY NO COUNTY. SO I ATTEND THE LA COUNTY- CAUCUS MEETINGS WE MEET ONCE A MONTH. AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REGIONALIZATION WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE JUST DO IN LA WOULD WE JUST DOING SAM RADIO BECAUSE WE KNOW.

AND OUR ASSEMBLY MAN FREDDIE RODRIGUEZ HE COVERS THE ENTIRE CITY OF ONTARIO TO SEE NO MYSTERY HERE AND OF COURSE IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMORY AS WITH US WE WORK TOGETHER QUITE A BIT- IT I GUESS IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM THE THING I'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT. IS ALL THESE FOLKS CARE ABOUT ONTARIO AIRPORT DASHES GREAT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE. AND I THINK WE CAN ALL START ON THE SAME LEVEL THAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE TRANSIT AND RAIL BROUGHT TO THE AIRPORT. AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE ATTITUDE THAT WE ARE TAKING FROM THE AIRPORT- ALL REEMPHASIZE WHAT ARE MAYOR STATED IS THAT OUR COUNCIL IS ON RECORD UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTING THE GOAL LINE. AND I HAVE TO ALSO SAY PERSONALLY SUPPORT THE GOAL LINE HAS THIS PC T. IS ALWAYS SUPPORTED THE GOAL LINE. AND I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THIS P. C. TA THAT IF THEIR GOLD LINE WORTH COUNTING ON WE ARE PREPARE TO BRING IT TO MONTCLAIR SO THAT'S NEVER BEEN. ANY ANY KIND OF POINTED DISCUSSION. HAVING SAID THAT THOUGH IT'S IMPORTANT FROM THE AIRPORT PERSPECTIVE- ARE BACKED UP TO THE SECOND. OUR COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY THE CITY AS WELL AS THE AIRPORT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT WILL GROW THE AIRPORT AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T IMPACT THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE FOLKS THAT LIVE IN THIS COMMUNITY. WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY IT REALLY MEANS THE ENTIRE. REGION HERE. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE- HAVE. AN ALLEY ACTS HAPPEN. WE CANNOT TRY TO BE. A TRANSFERRED. IN AT THE HARD IS ALREADY OCCURRED. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE AND- IN. PRIOR TO THE GROWTH OF THE AIRPORT. RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT FIVE AND A HALF MILLION PASSENGERS WERE PROBABLY GOING TO GO TO THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE MILLION PASSENGERS. AND LESS IT IMPACTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OUT HERE. NOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INTER CONNECTED READY. FOR US IT'S MUCH LARGER THAN LOS ANGELES AND SALMON TO DO NO COUNTIES ARE CATCHMENT AREA INCLUDES A SANKEY REBELLION LA COUNTY. IT INCLUDES RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND INCLUDES ORANGE COUNTY. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH RIVERSIDE IN ORANGE COUNTY TO DEVELOP CONNECTIVITY AS WELL USING RALPH. SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REACH ACROSS ALL THE COUNTY LINES. ALL OF THE FOLKS IN THIS ROOM AND I KNOW ALL THE MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE. HELPED US TREMENDOUSLY IN BRING IN LOCAL CONTROL TO OUR AIRPORT SO I KNOW THAT THE SUPPORT IS THERE FOR THAT. FROM THE AIRPORTS PERSPECTIVE WE WANT REAL TO THE AIRPORT. IF WE CAN GET THE GOLD LINE THERE GOD BLESS THAT IS GREAT WILL WELCOME IT WITH OPEN ARMS. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND WE CAN'T WAIT. TO SEE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE GOAL OF MINE. AND SO FROM S. B. C. T. A AND BY THE WAY ONCE AGAIN I'M SO EXCITED. THAT THE C. T. A. B. L. E. METRO AND CERTAINLY OUR STATE LEGISLATURE. HAVE STEPPED UP. TO SUPPORT US AND EVEN TAKE THE LEAD ON PROVIDING RELAXES TO THE AIRPORT I THINK EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU A LONG TAMI WHAT THAT ARE WHICH IS GOING TO BE A FIGHT FOR THE AIRPORT IN THE CITY. AND LOOK AT ALL THIS HELP THAT WE'RE GETTING SO I YOU KNOW I'M LOOKING AT THE POSITIVES. AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO DELIVER. TO THE AIRPORT IN AN EFFICIENT ENVIRONMENTALLY- SHAPE. ECONOMICAL WAY. ON WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO BRING FOLKS TO THE AIRPORT TO THE CAN UTILIZE IT MORE CAN. THAT. EIGHT FROM IS A RIP. AS CTA AND WE'RE TO HEAR FROM. WALL WE'VE BONTA OFF A TO. AN WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THAT A READY YOUR- WHERE THE FACT THAT SB C. T. IS FOR SUPS. LIFT RIDE FROM ANY OF THE MEASURE ST. IN THE- FOR MONTHS. UPLAND RANCHO. AND ONTARIO EAST. THAT'S THE FIRST PHASE. IN AN- BEFORE TOOK WILL CAN. L. A. D. NOT ALLOW ANY. ON POOR ARE ON THE TRAIN SYSTEM WITH FORCED TO DROP. OFF ON THE OUTER. AND THEN TAKE A- TO AIRPORT. SO ON THE DAY THAT WE TO CONTROL OMNITRANS BEGAN FIFTEEN MINUTE HEADWAYS INTO BOTH TERMINALS. SO WE BEGAN OUR TRANSIT AT THAT POINT TWO TO CONTROL WE'RE NOW DO CONNECTIVE ITTY THE METROLINK WRITER. IN WILL PROBABLY GO TO WILL. JUST LIKE THE DAY ANOTHER. OAKLAND EXAMPLE AND THEN IN WHAT THE SAME TIME WE'RE GONNA BE. ON A REAL CONNECTION NOW I KNOW YOU CAN SEE ON THE MAP UP HERE THAT THE JURY'S OPTION AVAIL AND I THINK THAT CALL WAS ALL GOING TO TALK ABOUT STUDY. THAT WE DID AT SKAGGS THE TALKS ABOUT THE VARIOUS WAYS TO CONNECT LA WITH ON SUMMER TO DO NO COUNTIES. BUT YOU CAN SEE THE MANY OPTIONS THAT ARE. SURE TALK ABOUT THE GOAL MINE IN MY HAVE OFF TO THE LINE FOR UNDER. YOU YOU CAN TRAVEL IN. IN THE WORLD AND PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE GOAL LINE. REALLY I MEAN EASY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU ARE THEY MAY NOT KNOW WHAT THE GOAL LINE IS BUT THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S A GOLD MINE. SO CERTAINLY THE GOAL LINE HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE PLAN FOR ACCESS TO THE AIRPORT AND IT'S STILL THERE. HAVING SAID THAT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL SPUR BETWEEN RANCHO CUCAMONGA AND THE AIRPORT- THE TECHNOLOGY. IS WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT IT WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE THE BORING TECHNOLOGY. THAT I MISTER MUSKIES USING IT COULD BE A PEOPLE MOVER WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IT IS- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR THE FIRST TIME. AT USING THE EL HAMBRE SUBDIVISION. NO THAT REAL IS THE ONE THAT'S CLOSEST TO THE AIRPORT. THE WOOD STICKLE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THAT THE CHAIRMAN INDIAN METROLINK LINE. IS NORTH. AND THE ROOM THE RIVERSIDE LINE OF THE ONTARIO STE. IS ALSO THE YEAR REPORTS WHICH REALLY DIFFICULT TO. THOSE TO THE PATH. AREA THE HAVE SUB. IT RIGHT THE YEAR. WEEK COMES UP OF AGREE AND- IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH TECHNOLOGY WERE YOU. PLEASED OF THE RIGHT OF WILL BE THE DELIVER. RIGHT TO THE- ARE STARTING. THE AS WELL CORE IS C. T. DEVELOP IS FOR LIGHT RAY SYSTEM. IN REDLANDS PASSED RAIL REDUCING ON THE- COME ON A MISSION. SYSTEM USING- GM YEARS ZERO MISSION UNITS IN THAT TEN REDLANDS AND CERTAINLY THERE'S AN EFFORT THAT COULD BRING THAT ACROSS FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST- AS I MENTIONED WE'RE WORKING WITH ORANGE COUNTY NOW THAT'S GOING TO DELIVER. REAL FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY ARCTIC. TO YEAR. TO A REALLY LOOKING AT ALL THE END WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE AT THE AIRPORT IS WHEN WE BUILT TERM THREE WHICH KNOW IS IN THAT SPACE BETWEEN. TWO AND FOUR. WE WANT A REAL DELIVERED TO THE IN THE TERM. TIME THAT THE LIST STEP WILL BILLS. THE WORLD IS. AND HAVING THAT DIRECT CAN. TO COM. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. SO AGAIN I THINK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST. I THINK AGAIN IF WE ALL START WITH THE PROMISE THAT WE WANT REAL ACCESS TO THE AIRPORT AND WORK FROM THAT FORWARD. AND WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCEED THE AIRPORT IS A LARGE ECONOMIC GENERATOR. AND IN CASE YOU'RE NOT A WERE THE ONLY UNCONSTRAINED AIRPORT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHICH MEANS IN THAT PHYSICAL OR POLITICAL WHICH MEANS THAT ONCE ALL THE OTHER PORTRAIT CAPACITY WHICH THEIR NEARLY THERE. ON KERRY'S ONLY PLACE THAT CAN HELP THE ENTIRE REGION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEEDED DEVIATION NEEDS. AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT. PEOPLE THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN THE SUCCESS OF ANTERIOR PORT AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR INTEREST. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU. ALL. REPORTER MISTER A SURE ENOUGH OF THE COMMITTEE FOR OUT. HE'LL BE WHATEVER PARTNERSHIP WHY DON'T. THE AND SHE SAID THAT I TO WEAR GLASSES WHEN I DO YOU CAN PRESIDENT. PAGE THAT I WANT TO YOU YOUR STAFF FOR NAY THIS HEARING. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THIS SLIDE IT REMINDS US THAT THE INLAND EMPIRE'S POPULATION HAS ALMOST DOUBLED IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. WE'RE ON TRACK TO REACH MORE THAN SIX MILLION PEOPLE BY TWENTY FORTY. THE NEXT SLIDE. TALKS TO US YOUR BACK ON THE- SO SINCE THE RECESSION THE NUMBER OF JOBS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE HAVE INCREASED BY NINETEEN POINT 1% SURPASSING CALIFORNIA'S JOB GROWTH OF TWELVE POINT 8% AND THE U. S. IS JOB GROWTH OF NINE POINT 6% THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE APPRECIATE SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION IT IS THE INLAND EMPIRE THAT HAS BEEN THE NUMBER ONE JOB CREATOR IN THE UNITED STATES. THE USE OF THE ONTARIO AIRPORT HAS INCREASED TO MORE THAN FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION PASSENGERS IN TWENTY NINETEEN IS PROJECTED TO SURPASS THIRTY MILLION BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. YET ACCESS TO THE AIRPORT HAS ACHIEVED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY PASSENGER VEHICLES. THE METROLINK PROVIDE SERVICE FROM RIVERSIDE THE CARRIES PASSENGERS INTO ONTARIO BUT DOES NOT DELIVER THEM DIRECTLY TO THE TERMINAL AREA AS WELL AS- TO- THE- METROLINK LINE FROM A UNION STATION- TO SAN BERNADINO. TO ACCOMMODATE THE PROJECTED GROWTH NOT JUST AT THE AIRPORT BUT IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PUBLIC RAIL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS THE CAN TRANSPORT PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE REGION. TO AND FROM THE AIRPORT QUICKLY. CITIES WITH AIRPORT RAIL LINKS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN THOSE WITHOUT- AIRPORT RAIL LINKS CAN BE A CATALYST FOR WIDER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. I WANNA STOP HERE AND PAINT A PICTURE THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT- ABOUT THE INLAND EMPIRE. SO WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT AND SO IF WE DRIVE BEG CIRCLE AROUND US RIGHT NOW TWENTY FIVE MILES OUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT- SOME OF THE POPULATION THAT EXISTS OKAY SO PRETTY MUCH. HOW THERE'S TWO MILLION PEOPLE THAT LIVE WITHIN TWENTY FIVE MILES OF THE AIRPORT. AND IF YOU GO SOUTH OF THE AIRPORT POMONA AB GOES POSTS THAT SOUTH AND NORTH OF THE TENT. BUT IF WE START IN SOUTH POMONA IN POMONA CITY OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND HOMES HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND. CHINO HILLS SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND CHINO EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND. CORONA A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND- RIVERSIDE- THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND- AND- MORENO VALLEY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. SO PRETTY MUCH SOUTH OF THE AIRPORT A MILLION PEOPLE OKAY A MILLION PEOPLE NOW LET'S TURN AROUND AND START ON NORTH RIGHT SO YOU BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THE CITY OF REDLANDS SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND- HIGHLAND- SAMPRADAY NO TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND- ONTARIO A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE THOUSAND FONTANA TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND- RIALTO- HUNDRED IN TWO THOUSAND- ALL THE WAY BACK RANCHO CUCAMONGA. ON'T AND THEN- AGAIN BACK TO POMONA ANOTHER MILLION PEOPLE. AND SO I REALLY URGE- YOU- AS WE DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE TO TAKE THAT INTO TO HEART. THERE ARE ANOTHER TWO POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE THAT LIVE OUTSIDE OF THAT TWENTY FIVE MILES- SO FROM PARIS DOWN TO THE MENIFEE VALLEY AND TO MARIETTA AND LOOKED AT AND- TEMECULA- OUR FRIENDS IN THE HIGH DESERT OUR FRIENDS IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY OUR FRIENDS IN THE MOUNTAIN AREAS. SO RAIL AND TRANSIT ACCESSIBILITY TO THE AIRPORT IS ABSOLUTELY A KEY ECONOMIC DRIVER FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS REGION. ARE BUSINESS MEMBERS- WOULD- TELL YOU THAT THERE'S AN URGENCY TO THIS THEIR ABILITY TO CONNECT TO THE AIRPORT THEIR ABILITY TO BRING- PEOPLE INTO THE AIRPORT TO DO BUSINESS ABSOLUTELY KEY. SO DELIVERY OF WHATEVER OPTIONS WE HAVE THE SOONER THE BETTER. AND ALSO I THINK THAT PART OF THAT FROM THE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR MEMBERS AGAIN WHO ARE THE LARGER EMPLOYERS OF THE REGION- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH BUREAUCRACY. RIGHT IT. TRANSIT AND TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS ARE EXPENSIVE AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN DO THAT WITH AN EXISTING- AGENCIES- I THINK ARE BUSINESS MEMBERS WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S THAT'S BEST. TALK ABOUT THAT TWENTY FIVE MILE CIRCLE- COUNSELING WAPNER- TALKED ABOUT- AS SOME OF THE ISSUES- THE PARISH SCHOOL BOARD IS TWO MILES SOUTH OF THE AIRPORT TWO MILES SOUTH THAT HAS POTENTIAL CONNECTIVITY TO RIVERSIDE AND EVERYBODY GOING THAT WAY WHAT IT IS THE SOLUTION FOR THAT TWO MILES- I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT- THE GREAT- POTENTIAL OF THE- THE ERRO- SYSTEM- GOING IN FROM- SAMBAR DINO TO REDLANDS- AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE FIRST EVER IN THE NATION ZERO EMISSION- TRANSIT OPPORTUNITY- TO THE NORTH OF THE AIRPORT. AND THEN FIGURING OUT AGAIN HOW WE CONNECT- THAT SYSTEM TO THE AIRPORT AS WELL AS AS THE GOLD MINE. AS YOUR EXAMINE OUR WAYS TO ACHIEVE RAIL- TO THE AIRPORT- I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THE LARGER REGION- HOW DO WE PROVIDE THAT ACCESS TO SAN BERNARDINO TO CORONA TO CHINO. TO THE HIGH DESERT TO MACULA AND THE COACHELLA VALLEY'S. WE SHOULD ALSO SEEK TO AVOID DUPLICATING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. INSTEAD WE SHOULD FOCUS ON WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE RELEVANT AGENCIES IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF A MORE CONNECTED REGION I THINK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON TOP MCINTYRE CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER FOR METROLINK PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF OUR CEO STEPHANIE WEEK INTO SINCE OUR REGRETS SHE CANNOT MAKE IT TODAY. WE WANTED TO TALK A BIT IF WE GO TO METRO LINK SYSTEMS AND- REITERATE WHAT I BELIEVE ALL OF YOU HAVE SHARED WHICH IS THAT OUR SHARED GOAL IS TO DO OUR BEST AND PROVIDE AS MANY ALTERNATIVES TO. PRIVATE AUTOMOBILES AS POSSIBLE. METROLINK DOES THAT MEASURE LIKE HELPS US TO ACCOMPLISH THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED REDUCTION GOALS. AND TO CONNECT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES- TO HOUSING AS WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE THE OLD ADAGE IS DRIVE TO QUALIFY THERE ARE NOW WRITING TO YOU QUALIFY ON THAT FEELING SERVICES. OUR SYSTEM MAP I THINK IT SHOWS REALLY THE GREAT INTER REGIONAL CONNECTIVITY- OF THE METROLINK SYSTEM. FIVE OF THESE COUNTIES INCLUDING SAMBAR DINO IN IT LOS ANGELES COUNTY ARE I REMEMBER AGENCIES IN FUNDING AGENCIES WE ALSO SERVICE SIX COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. WE CONNECT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO A LOT OF JOBS. ARE AVERAGE RIDER- OVER THAT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILES SYSTEM. GOES APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SIX MILES ONE WAY. 60% OF OUR WRITERS ACROSS THE COUNTY LINE. TODAY WE KNOW THAT CAR. SO THEY ARE CHOOSING TO TAKE METROLINK SERVICE AND THEREFORE REDUCING APPROXIMATELY NINE POINT THREE MILLION CAR TRIPS PER YEAR- AS OF FY NINETEEN. THE CEO VISION HERE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND- ENHANCE METROLINK SERVICE IS ONE THAT FOCUSES FIRST AND PRIMARILY ON THE CUSTOMER. TO GET PEOPLE TO GET ON THE SYSTEM WE KNOW IT HAS TO BE SEAMLESS AND EASY AND WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE THEM PLAY DETECTIVE IN OUR TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT. AND SO. WE HAVE- INITIATED A FEW KEY. STRATEGIES LIKE A WIFI PILOT TESTS. OVER TEN YEARS. WIFI IMMUNITY WAS THE MOST REQUESTED IMMUNITY ON THE METROLINK SERVICE. AND IN NOVEMBER WE INITIATED THE FIRST TEST. WITH EIGHTEEN T. AND WE WILL BE INITIATING ANOTHER TEST- WITH SPRINT AS A CARRIER. TO IDENTIFY WAYS FOR US TO BRING AMENITIES LIKE THAT. WITHOUT INCREASING THE COST TO OUR MEMBER AGENCIES IMPORT. AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM IS REALLY KEY AND WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPLEMENTARY- USES AND APPROACHES BETWEEN A METROLINK GOAL LINE AND THE FIFTY ONE OTHER TRANSIT OPERATORS THAT WE ALLOW TRANSFERS TO THIRTY TWO OF THOSE FREE TRANSFERS. AND WE RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT WE ARE A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WE'RE MODERNIZING OUR BIG BUSINESS PRACTICES IN WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL- WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE DELIVER SERVICE AND THE OPERATIONS OF OUR SYSTEM DIFFERENTLY THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST INCREASING THE TECHNOLOGY- IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE GONE FROM THE INITIATION OF SMARTPHONES TO EVERYONE HAVING ONE IN THEIR POCKETS TODAY. NEXT SLIDE HAS OUR RIDERSHIP METRICS WHICH SHOW THAT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN CONTINUOUS RIDERSHIP GROWTH- PEAKING ARE EXCUSE ME. CAPPING IN FY NINETEEN ELEVEN POINT NINE MILLION TRIPS TAKEN WHICH IS A RECORD OF OUR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF SERVICE. THE GREATEST GROWTH WE'VE SEEN HAS BEEN OFF PEAK AND WEEKEND SERVICE- AND A LOT OF FAMILIES TAKEN THAT SERVICE- IN LINE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER PRESS COMMENTS. WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE METROLINK SYSTEM TAKES APPROXIMATELY TWO LANES OF PARALLEL CAPACITY HIGHWAY CAPACITY OFF OF THE HIGHWAYS. WE ALSO SHARE YOUR VISION FOR A SUSTAINABLE AND HEALTHIER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE TAKING DELIVERY OF FORTY TEAR FOR AND THAT'S THE EPA DESIGNATION HIGHEST. CLASSIFICATION OF CLEAN DIESEL TECHNOLOGY AND THEY'RE REPLACING OUR OLDEST FLEET AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY UP 285% FROM THAT FLEET WE ALSO IN- PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR MEMBER AGENCIES HERE SB CTA LOOKING AT ZERO EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGY AND- LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY RETROFIT SOME OF THOSE OLD DIESEL LOCOMOTIVES ARE COMING OUT OF SERVICE. WITH SOMETHING LIKE BATTERY ELECTRIC OR HYDROGEN TAXI REDEPLOY THEM AS PART OF A ZERO EMISSIONS FLEET AS WELL. WE TALKED ABOUT IT TRACKING A RETAINING WRITERS A COUPLE OF THINGS I'D JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAD A FREE FAIR DAY. ON EARTH DAY WE SO I 48% RIDERSHIP INCREASE ON OUR SYSTEM. MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THAN THAT THOUGH WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE DOWNLOAD OF OUR MOBILE APPS WHERE PEOPLE CAN EASILY BUY TICKETS FOR THEIR FAIRS. AND A PROXY NINETY FIVE THOUSAND NEW RETURNING RIDERS AS A RESULT OF THAT. I MENTIONED THE TEST PILOT AND IN- KEEPING WITH THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT THAT WERE COMING OUT OF. A WE HAD A NEW APPROACH TO HOLIDAY TRAINS AND WE ACTUALLY RAN FOR DIFFERENT HOLIDAY TRAINS AT A VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE BETWEEN DOLLARS PER PASSENGER THEY WERE SOLD OUT. AND WE HAD A LOT OF FAMILIES AND GREAT RECEPTION AND RESPONSE TO THAT AND EXPECT TO EXPAND THAT INTO THE FUTURE. ON THE NEXT SLIDE A REGIONAL CONNECTIVITY- A LOT HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE ONTARIO AIRPORT REDLANDS THEREFORE WE ALSO HAVE TO- STATIONS FOR METROLINK AT THE HOLLYWOOD BURBANK AIRPORT. AND WE AGREE THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS TO STUDY HOW. WE CAN PROVIDE MULTIPLE OPTIONS TO GET TO THE DIFFERENT AIRPORTS THROUGHOUT OUR REGION INCLUDING ONTARIO. NEXT I'D LIKE TO JUST SHOW A- BRIEF VIDEO THE SCORE OR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPTIMIZE RAIL EXPANSION PROGRAM AS OUR TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM THERE REALLY WANTS TO- SEEKS TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES. TO REALLY MAKE US A PREMIERE OPERATOR BY THE TIME THE OLYMPICS ARRIVE- AND PART OF THAT PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE ARE LIKE THE LILACS RIALTO DOUBLE TRACK PROJECT- THAT IS CURRENTLY IN OUR TRANSPORTATION AS YOU TRANSIT INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL- APPLICATION WITH THE STATE. EACH DAY AS THE SUN BEGINS TO RISE OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OVER TWENTY ONE MILLION PEOPLE ARE COMING IN GO. WHETHER THEY'RE HEADING TO SCHOOL WORK OR A BALL GAME METROLINK PROVIDES PEOPLE A CONVENIENT STRESS FREE AND GREEN WAITED TROUT. WE MUST DO MORE IN ORDER TO SERVE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S GROWING POPULATION AND MEET THE STATE'S AMBITIOUS GOALS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. METRO LINK HAS AN AMBITIOUS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN TO UPGRADE ITS SYSTEMS SO THAT THE REGION GETS MORE. AND JUST IN TIME FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES WITH OUR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPTIMIZED RAIL EXPANSION PROGRAM FOUR SCORE WITH STORE. THE REGION GETS MORE. SCORE WILL CREATE A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT SEAMLESSLY CONNECTS OUR JOB CENTERS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WILL HELP LOCAL BUSINESSES GROW AND THRIVE. THE STORE ALSO PROVIDES MORE SAFE RELIABLE TRAINS. INFREQUENT SERVICE THAT MEANS THE GIRLS ONE DIRECTION DURING PEAK COMMUTE TIMES TO SERVICE THAT RUNS REGULARLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. MORE JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE REGION MORE CLEAN AIR BECAUSE WHEN MORE PEOPLE WRITING NATURALLY MORE CARS ARE PARKED WHICH REDUCES TRAFFIC AND EMISSIONS ON THE MAJOR FREEWAYS TO CHANGE INTO THE METRO LINK SYSTEMS. STORE INCLUDES OVER TEN BILLION WORTH OF. PROJECTS IN GRADE CROSSING THAT IN TEN. AND ALLOW CITIES TO LIVE. SIGNAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT STREAMLINED. TRACKING THAT WILL RESULT IN FEWER DELAYS AND MORE SERVICE WHEN THERE'S DEMAND AND FUNDING WORKED IT WILL LOOK AT SALARY PROGRESS TOWARDS OURS ZERO EMISSIONS FUTURE. A STUDY BY THE LOS ANGELES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION ESTIMATES THAT SCORE WILL CREATE OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS BEFORE THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES AND OVER A THIRTY YEAR PERIOD THIS STUDY FORECAST APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION JOBS AND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN GROSS REGIONAL PRODUCT WILL BE ADDED TO THE ECONOMY THROUGHOUT OUR FIVE. COUNTY SERVICE AREA METROLINK DOES MORNING TENANTS FROM POINT A TO BE IT. SAYS AS A COMMUNITY IN SO MANY WAYS. FROM YOUR HOME TO YOUR CAREER FROM YOUR FRIENDS IN THE VALLEY TO YOUR FAMILY AND RIVERSIDE OR TO THE BEACHES AND VENTURA LA AN ORANGE COUNTY COAST LINE. FOR YOUR HEALTH AND FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR PLANET. NATURALLY RIDES WITH YOU. FIND OUT HOW YOU CAN GET MORE WITH SCORES AT METROLINK TRAINS .COM FORWARD SLASH SCORE. ALL RIGHT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND JUST I'LL JUST CONCLUDE WITH THE FINAL SLIDE WHICH IS SHOWS THE ECONOMIC. IMPACT IN BENEFIT OF THE SCORE PROGRAM BY COUNTY- IN TERMS OF GDP AND JOB CREATION SO WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO GROW THE BENEFITS OF METRO LINK AND DOUBLE OUR RIDERSHIP IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING- CARE HOLDEN MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RAY WOLF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAMBAR DINO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF THE SYSTEM PANEL THIS MORNING IF I COULD JUST DIGRESS BRIEFLY CHAIR HOLDING YOU TALKED ABOUT SKATEBOARDING AND MILLENNIALS IN YOUR INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS- I WOULD SUGGEST JUST LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM AND I MEAN NO OFFENSE- THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PRESENT HERE THIS MORNING OUGHT NOT TO TRY TO RIDE SKATEBOARDS. I PROVIDE A LIVING TESTIMONIAL TO THAT- AND WITH THAT I'LL I'LL MOVE ON. SO I WANT TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS AND PRIMARILY THIS MORNING ON THE EXCITING PILOT THAT WE ARE PARTNERING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY THAT IS TO INTRODUCE THE FIRST SELF POWERED ZERO EMISSION PASSENGER TRAIN IN THE UNITED STATES AND QUITE POSSIBLY IN NORTH AMERICA WE COLLEGE EMAIL I THINK THAT'S KIND OF A COOL NAME. THE VEHICLE CAN OPERATE ON EXISTING RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE INTERMINGLED WITH HEAVY FREIGHT AND HEAVY PASSENGER RAIL SUCH AS WHAT METROLINX OPERATES TODAY WE WERE ALREADY PLANNING TO BRING THE DIESEL VERSION OF THIS VEHICLE TYPE INTO SERVICE WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS ON A NINE MILE EXTENSION OF THE METROLINX AND WITHIN A LINE FROM DOWNTOWN SAMBAR TO DO YOU KNOW PROPER THE UNIVERSITY EDMUNDS AND IT WAS REALLY NOT PROJECT THAT SPURRED OUR DESIRE TO LOOK FLOOR CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES GIVEN THE THREAT OF THE VEHICLE THAT WE WERE OPERATING. WE SIGNED A CONTRACT- LOOKED ADLER A SWISS RAIL CAR MANUFACTURER- JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR A TO BUILD THAT FIRST PILOT VEHICLE AND WE EXPECT DELIVERY THAT VEHICLE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR JUST FOR YOUR YEAR AWAY SO I THINK THAT'S A IT. AND I HOPE THAT YOU SHARE WITH ME THE EXCITEMENT THE WE ARE IN A LEADING HERE IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY IF WE COULD GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK SLIDES HERE- THIS JUST KINDA SHOWS THE ACTUALLY GO BACK ONE I'M SORRY THIS SHOWS SORT OF THE INSIDE OF THIS NEW VEHICLE THAT'LL BE OPERATIONAL- IN OUR COUNTY WITHIN A FEW YEARS AND ONE OF THINGS I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THE LUGGAGE RACKS- THAT THERE OF THE SEATS THESE ARE NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLES- YOU KNOW WHATEVER THEY'RE CARRYING WITH THEM- IS ARE MOVING FROM COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITY- BUT COULD ALSO BE VERY IMPORTANT THE LONELY TALK ABOUT A RAIL CONNECTION. TO ENTER THE WINNER TIONAL AIRPORT WE CAN SO. THIS SLIDE HERE JUST HOME IN AND IN THE VEHICLE THAT WILL OPERATE. THAT WILL HAVE ROOM FOR BY BUT THAT CAN ALL. ADD ADDITIONAL CAPACITY OF FOR LUGGAGE WHICH IS GOING TO BE IMPERATIVE FOR ANY CONNECTION THAT WE ULTIMATELY BRING INTO THE AIRPORT PROPERTY. AND WE COULD GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE TRANSITIVE REALLY ABOUT CONNECTING PEOPLE AND PLACES IN A CONVENIENT MANNER. AS DEPICTED ON THIS SLIDE EASY CROSS PLATFORM CONNECTIONS ARE POSSIBLE. WITH THE Z. MOVE- CONNECTING TO OTHER TRANSIT SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE REGION NOT UNLIKE WHAT MORE MATURE SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES EUROPE AND ASIA PROVIDE TODAY. AND THE LAST LINE PLEASE I HOPE THAT- AGAIN THAT YOU SHARE WITH US THE EXCITEMENT- THAT WE ARE SHEPHERDING THIS NEW REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY- HERE ON AMERICAN SHORES. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT TO ADDRESS THE DOG IT CONCERNS OF SOME WHO ALLEGE THAT WE AT SPC TA OR I PERSONALLY OPPOSE THE GOAL LINE. THAT IS NOT TRUE AS PART OF THE LARGER METRO LIGHT RAIL NETWORK THE GOAL LINE PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT CHOICE AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD THIS MORNING FOR COMMUTERS AND OTHERS TO AVOID OUR CONGESTED FREEWAYS IT'S CONNECTIVITY TO MULTIPLE TRANSIT SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE LOS ANGELES REGION IS EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE STRIVING TO ACCOMPLISH. MY COMMENTS AT THE SPC T. A BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING LAST SEPTEMBER WERE SIMPLY THAT I WOULD BRING FORWARD A RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD TO LOOK AT COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES NOTING THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY TO PROVIDE HIGHER FREQUENCY SERVICE USING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SB CTA BORDERS ALLEN MENTIONED HAS BEEN CLEAR IN ITS SUPPORT OF THE GOAL LINE TO MONTCLAIR PRIOR TO AND SUBSEQUENT TO THAT SEPTEMBER MEETING. MY COMMENTS WERE SPURRED BY THE NEED TO ADDRESS TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT NOT ONLY IN THE CITY OF MONTCLAIR. BUT ALSO IN RANCHO CUCAMONGA AND OTHER COMMUNITIES CURRENTLY SERVED BY THE SAMBAR DINO METROLINK LINE. FUNDS FOR TRANSIT INVESTMENT IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ARE SCARCE IN OUR COUNTY AND SO WE MUST MAKE JUDICIOUS DECISIONS TO SERVICE THE GREATEST EXTENT OF OUR POPULATION. MY COMMENTS WERE INTENDED TO START A TOUGH CONVERSATION AND THEY CERTAINLY HAVE. MY JOB IS TO ADVISE THE SB CTA BOARD OF OPTIONS ALLOWING THEM TO MAKE EDUCATED DECISIONS AND THEN MY JOB IS TO IMPLEMENT THOSE POLICY DECISIONS. THAT IS ALL I HAVE DONE THANK YOU AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND WE DO APPRECIATE- EACH OF YOU MAKING. A PRESENTATION I THINK WAS VERY- THOUGHTFUL AND HAD SUBSTANCE BEHIND IT AND- MET OUR SEVEN MINUTE TIME FRAME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M GOING TO TURN TO MY COLLEAGUES- THE TO SEE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO INITIATE ANY COMMENTS OR OR QUESTIONS BASED ON THE FOR PRESENTATIONS- I JUST HAVE A FEW WILL COMMENT THAT'LL MAKE- BUT ALL YOU'LL TO THEM AT THIS POINT. SENATOR QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ALL EXCELLENT PRESENTATIONS I ENJOYED HEARING ABOUT ALL OF THEM I'M GONNA START WITH JUST A COMMENT- AND THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE WITH ME AT THE- ON TERRIO CHAMBER MEETING BEFORE THIS HEARD ME SAY THAT WHEN I WAS ELECTED OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS DID NOT WORK WELL TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT ALL OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WORK VERY WELL TOGETHER AND WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER GOOD THINGS HAPPEN SO I'M GOING TO. CHALLENGE OUR TRANSPORTATION GROUPS TO WORK BETTER TOGETHER. AND ALL OF YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE I HAVE SAID THIS TO ALL OF YOU PRIVATELY BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT. PUBLICLY WHEN YOU CAN'T PUT US IN THE MIDDLE YOU KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE THIS YOU DON'T LIKE THIS AND EVERYBODY WANTS THEIR OWN THING. WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER I'VE HEARD SO MANY GOOD IDEAS ON BOTH SIDES. METRO METROLINK GOLDLINE BUT WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN SILOS OF FOR ACTUALLY GOING TO- BENEFIT ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT. SO I'M GOING TO CHALLENGE ALL OF YOU TO DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE A SELECTED AND LEARN TO WORK TOGETHER. BUT WITH THAT- I WANTED TO ASK- MISTER WALKER- WHAT YOU THINK THE BEST OPTION IS FOR CONNECTING RESIDENTS TO THE AIRPORT. WHICHEVER ONE WE CAN GET BUILT. REALLY WE HAVEN'T REALLY WORKED- COMPARE THE OPTIONS BECAUSE THE ABOVE SO QUICKLY YOU KNOW IT WEEK AS FAR AS THE GOLD ONE CONNECTION TO THE AIRPORT THAT HAS NEVER BEEN PLAN AND IT'S NOT FUNDED AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE AND I WAS REALLY HOPING YOU GUYS FOR COMING WITH A CHECKBOOK. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S GONNA TAKE FOR ANY OF THESE PLANS TO HAPPEN. SO AT THIS POINT AGAIN THE AIRPORTS PERSPECTIVE IS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ONE OF THESE WORK AS LONG AS IT WORKS IN A SERVER HERE PORT NESTERS THE FOLKS THAT WE SERVE. SO I'M SORRY SHOULD I CAN'T GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC ANSWER BECAUSE- WE'RE NOT SET AND ANYONE OF THE OPTION TO REALLY OPEN TO ANY OF THEM. OKAY THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU I DO HAVE MY PERSONAL CHECKBOOK BUT I DON'T THINK IT GETS US WHERE. THIRTY AND THEN YOU PS IS DOING GREAT WORK IN EXPANDING THEIR AT THE AIRPORT- AND I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT THE PLAN IS TO MITIGATE THAT TRAFFIC BECAUSE I'M SURE THERE'S GOING TO BE. MUCH MORE TRAFFIC ONCE IT'S BUILT HAVE YOU GUYS THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR AND I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP BECAUSE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE CARGO AND OF THE AIRPORT. WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. RESPONSIBLE FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THE AREA- OBVIOUSLY YOU PS HAS HUGE PRESENCE BUT MORE EXCITING THE IS FED EX. IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING. A HUB FOR FED EX. IN FACT FOR THE FOLKS HERE IN THIS YEAR YOU CAN BE VERY PROUD TO KNOW. THAT OUR AIRPORT IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE- AIRPORT FOR OUTGOING CARGO WE OVERTOOK ATLANTA AIRPORT A FEW MONTHS AGO. BUT THE QUESTION IS AGAIN OUR COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY TO NOT MEDIC NOT NOT IMPACT THE COMMUNITY IN A NEGATIVE MANNER. SO WE ACTUALLY. PRIOR TO ALL OF THIS GROWTH WE RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING TO CREATE A GROUND ACCESS PROGRAM. SO WE HAVE A BROWN ACCESS PROGRAM NOT NECESSARILY JUST FOR CARGO. THERE'S IMPROVEMENTS BE MADE AND GROVE AVENUE WE'RE LOOKING TO CHANGE THE INTERCHANGE OF THE TEN FREEWAY GROW SO CLOSE ALL THE WAY FROM THE TEN. TO THE SIXTY WITH EXPANDED CAPACITY FOR CARGO AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SPECIFIC CARGO CIRCULATION PLAN. IN AND ON THE AIRPORT GROUNDS ITSELF. VERY GOOD THANK YOU IT'S VERY HELPFUL FOR METROLINK. I KNOW THAT- LA METRO HAS INFUSED MONEY TO REDUCE THE FARES FOR WRITERS IS THAT IN PERPETUITY OR DOES THAT COME TO AN END AT SOME POINT YES THAT SAY PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN SB CTA AND LA METRO THAT HELP TO REDUCE MAYORS IN OF THE THIS A TEST PERIOD FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS. THREE HALF YEARS HOW FAR INTO THE THREE YEARS OUR WAY ONE ONE OKAY SO TWO YEARS AND THEN YOU'LL REEVALUATE YES OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU. DOCTOR WOLFE I AM JUST CURIOUS- HAVE YOU IN SB TEETH CTA HAD ANY DISCUSSIONS IN REGARD TO CONNECT TO THE AIRPORT AND THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU FORESEE GETTING THERE. WE CERTAINLY HAVE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO OUR BOARD IN TWO SHORT WEEKS- TO COMMITTEE ACTUALLY- WITH A SCOPE OF WORK THAT LOOKS AT AND ALLEN WALKER HAD HAD A GENERAL MAP UP THERE THAT LOOKS AT MULTIPLE OPTIONS OF CONNECTING TO THE AIRPORT. OUR GOAL IS TO COMPLETE- AND ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS- THAT BUILDS ON WHAT'S GAG IS DONE IN THE PAST WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST AND OTHERS- SO THAT WE CAN START THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK WITHIN THREE SHORT YEARS. BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE AS ALAN POINTED OUT OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TIMELINE THAT WE HAVE THAT WE FACE THERE AT FIVE POINT SIX MILLION ANNUAL PASSENGERS TODAY THEY'RE GONNA HIT THIRTY MILLION IN IN VERY SHORT ORDER AND SO WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING NOW AND NOT WAIT- OUR GOAL WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY IN OUR CURRENT MEASURE TO BUILD THIS CONNECTION. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T PUSH THE ENVELOPE AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND THEN WE WILL BE COMING UP AND POUNDING ON YOUR DOORS AND SACRAMENTO WITHIN A FEW SHORT YEARS LOOKING FOR THE MONEY- THAT WE CAN. START TO CONSTRUCT THIS PROJECT I THINK THAT WE CAN START CONSTRUCTION AND TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN FOR A RAIL CONNECTION WHATEVER THAT IS FOR A RAIL CONNECTION ONTARIO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED YOUR HELP. VERY GOOD THANK YOU A I THINK CAN SEE FOR MY- AND PRY MY COLLEAGUES WE STAND READY TO HELP- TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. I THANK YOU TO THE WHOLE PANEL VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. THIS RACE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. JUST ONE COMMENT AND I'D LIKE TO- ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH MANY OF THE COMMENTS FROM MY EYES STEAMED SENATOR IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES WE KNOW WE WANT TO CONNECT TWENTY AIRPORT I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES WITH THAT- I THINK HAVE COMING UP WITH THE ALTERNATIVE THAT YOU ALL THINK IS THE BEST THEN ALLOWS US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH WHATEVER IT IS WE NEED TO DO TO HELP YOU WITH THE FUNDING. BUT THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STEP IN YOU ALL ARE THE EXPERTS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING YOU AT THAT POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THEN TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING ELSE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE WE DO WANT THAT CONNECTIVITY TO THE AIRPORT ESPECIALLY BEFORE THE OLYMPICS I THANK YOU ALL FOR THE PRESENTATION AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO KNOWING WHAT. THE GREAT MINDS DECIDE IS THE BEST SOLUTION FOR THAT THANK YOU. THE YOU AGAIN ARBOR FOR THEIR PRESENTATIONS IT'S- COMMON THEME I'M HEARING AS WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER. SOLVE THESE ISSUES AND LIKE THE CENTER SAYS THE MORE WE WORK TOGETHER WE WENT TOGETHER. A NO I'M JUST LOOKING BACK AT AT- WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK ON WITH THIS PROJECT EVER SINCE I GOT ELECTED IN. THE ELECTION IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN. HI ONE OF MY FIRST BILLS AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY FOUR. WAS THINKING THAT THAT EXTENSION FROM. MONCLER INTO THE AIRPORT AND SEEM LIKE BACK THEN. THERE ARE SOME HESITATION PEOPLE DON'T REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH ME I THINK. SOME FOLKS IN THE ROOM HERE WERE IN MY OFFICER AN AUNT AND CHINO WE HAD THAT DISCUSSION SEEM LIKE BACK THEN THERE'S PUSH BACK. OF THE GOAL LINE FOR SOME REASON I DON'T KNOW WHERE SO IT'S LIKE THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE. HOW BEST TO GET THE GOAL LINE TO THE AIRPORT WORKING TOGETHER AND NOW WE'RE PRESENT HERE WERE OUT THAT WE'RE STILL HAVING SOME. OF YOUR COLOR PUSH BACK OR HESITATION WHAT NOT. LET'S TRY TO MAKE SURE WE CAN GET ON THE SAME PAGE BECAUSE LIKE SAID IT'S A SOMETHING. FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. BACK IN LEX'S TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH. MY BILL I'M SURE YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND OUT THERE- A. B. TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY FOUR. IT WAS KINDA LIKE NOT THAT STUDY HOW HOW WOULD IT LOOK LIKE EXTENDING THE GOAL LINE FROM MONTCLAIR. INTO THE AIRPORT AND NOW FAST FOR TORE AT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER ALTERNATIVES BUT- LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT WORKING TOGETHER OR NOT. YOU KNOW DIVIDING ONCE. ONE ANOTHER FROM. ULTIMATELY THE GOAL OF CONNECTING THE AIRPORT TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND REALLY HELPING OUR FAMILIES AND THE BARMAN AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH THAT. SO JUST A COMMENT I WONDER ST THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AS WELL. THANK YOU I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT I THINK THAT A AND- TO NOTE THAT AS RELATES TO THE GOAL LINE. YOU KNOW IT'S A PROJECT THAT'S BEEN UNDER WAY FOR. DECADES AND WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF HAVING THE PROJECT- MAKE ITS WAY TO AN END TO- THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. SO I THINK ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES AND OBVIOUSLY PART OF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE CENTER AND OTHERS SENATOR AND OTHERS HAVE. ARTICULATED IS WE'RE BRINGING IN A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM OF THE WESTERN SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COMMUNITIES. OF THAT UTILIZE THE AIRPORT AND- CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY AND DOLLARS SPENT AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ POINTED OUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. MAKE THAT LINK COMPLETE BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. MANY OF THE PLANS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT- IN TERMS OF SORT OF INTEGRATING THE ENTIRE- INLAND EMPIRE. INTO THE AIRPORT MAKING CONNECTION REAL CONNECTIVITY IS CRITICAL AS WELL SO I I'M YOU KNOW I JOIN WITH. MY COLLEAGUES TO SAY THAT. SO WE WILL BE A PARTNER AND CONTINUING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO- INSURE THAT THE GREATER SAN BERNARDINO RIVERSIDE COUNTY AREAS ARE BEING ABLE TO LINK TO. A RESOURCE THAT IS NOT JUST FOR SAMBAR INYO COUNTY BUT CERTAINLY AS OF A DRIVER OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS CREATOR OF. OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL AND AS SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN PASADENA AND LOS THE IDEA OF- DRIVING TO LA ACTS AND BEING A PART OF THAT- NETWORK OF PARKING AND GETTING TO TERMINAL- I THINK WE ALL RELISH THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CLEANER SAFER WAY TO TRAVEL TO AN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND I THINK THAT. THIS DYNAMIC NEEDS TO WE NEED TO TIE UP THE LOOSE ENDS ON THAT. BUT JUST BE ONE DOLLARS. PEOPLE THROUGHOUT. VOTERS THROUGHOUT- THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY THE INLAND EMPIRE SUPPORTED. AND IT IS OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FAIR SHARE OF DOLLARS MAKE THEIR WAY INTO IMPORTANT PROJECTS- IN THE IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO. THIS CONVERSATION AND OTHERS THAT WILL FOLLOW HELP US GET A ROAD MAP OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SO THAT WE'RE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE POSITION TO BE ABLE TO ADVOCATE IN THE LOBBY. OF FOR. THE DOLLARS THAT SHOULD RIGHTFULLY COME INTO THIS REGION- SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT I THINK. ARRAY YOU'VE ALREADY OUTLINED THE- OUR PROCESS AND HOW. THE GOAL LINE IS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THAT SO A YOUR YOUR PLANNING PROCESS IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT I THINK AT SOME POINT SEEING- SOME CLEAR DEFINITIVE. L. NARROWING IN ON THAT SIX OR SEVEN. MILE GAP BECAUSE I MEAN LOOK. AS I MADE CLEAR IN MY OPENING STATEMENTS WE DO HAVE A FUNDING GAP BETWEEN POMONA. AND MARK LAYER. BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING VERY HARD AND COLLABORATIVELY TO SEE THAT WE CAN GET THAT- THAT GAP. OF FUNDING OF FINISH WE HAD A GAP. FROM A SEUSS- TO- TO PROMOTE POMONA- AND WE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS HILL SO I HAVE EVERY BIT OF CONFIDENCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE RESOURCES. TO SEE THE LINE- TO MONTCLAIR. THE POINT IS WE DON'T NEED PEOPLE THAN HAVING TO UBER FROM MY CLEAR TO THE AIRPORT. SO BUT COUNT ME AS A- ALONG WITH THE OTHERS AS A- A STALWART IN SUPPORT OF- SUPPORTING PLANS THAT MOVE. OF THE PEOPLE OF- THE INLAND EMPIRE. TO THE AIRPORT AND ONTARIO. I ALSO WANTED TO JUST TAKE A SECOND TO ON THE- MEASURE LIKE PRESENTATION- TODD WHERE YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW THE- RIDERSHIP IS INCREASING AND IT IT'S IMPORTANT TO THIS CONVERSATION TODAY EVEN THOUGH IT CENTERS ON THE POTENTIAL OF. A LINE A DOUBLING OF THE LINE- TO EXTEND FROM BURBANK AIRPORT TO WHERE THE COMMUNITY BURBANK- TO ORANGE COUNTY. IS THERE ANY AND I KNOW AND- HELLO LAURA FRIEDMAN WHO IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY BUT IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN SHARE ON THAT BECAUSE OF WHAT I UNDERSTAND. IF THAT WERE TO BE PUT IN PLACE THE REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC OR CARS OFF OF THE FIVE FREEWAY BETWEEN THAT STRETCHES WHO IF THE NUMBERS THAT I'M HERE IN OUR CORRECT. INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT WHICH IMPACT THE ENTIRE REGION AS IT RELATES TO THE- THE FREEWAY SYSTEM IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN ADD ON- OR- VERIFY AROUND WHAT'S WHAT CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING ON THAT KIND OF A PROJECT- THANK YOU JERROLD AND- I BELIEVE THAT- THERE ARE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN- THE SPEAKER. OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- LOOKING AT WAYS FORWARD IN ORDER TO TRY TO- INSURE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT POSSIBLE IN RAIL AND IN THE CORRIDOR HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT ULTIMATELY CAN HELP THEM GET. HIGH SPEED RAIL READY IN WHAT WE DID IS WE WORKED WITH- THE HIGHEST REAL AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE THEM INFORMATION AS TO THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT- THAT WAS NEEDED. AND OVERALL JUST CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM TO SEE IF THERE MAY BE SOME OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE FOR- THE GROWTH IN. FUNDING FOR RAIL INVESTMENT TO HELP US TO ACHIEVE OUR THE ANTI AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS IN AN ANSWER THE- IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN IN THAT LINE WERE TO BE DOUBLED WHAT IS THE ANTICIPATED. NUMBER PERCENTAGE OF CARS REMOVED FROM THE FIVE FREEWAY IN THE STATE IS THERE A I BELIEVE WE HAD JUST ABOUT A FIVE POINT. THREE MILLION ADDITIONAL RIDERSHIP TRIPS AND IF YOU. DO THE EQUIVALENT. RIGHT NOW ABOUT LOVE POINT NINE SO JUST UNDER HALF OF THAT SO THAT'S IN A- CONTINUED REDUCTION OF MAYBE AROUND YOU KNOW FOUR FIVE MILLION. VEHICLE TRIPS JUST FROM THAT CORRIDOR ALONG. I KNOW I GET EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING OUT OF THAT THING AND JUST- IN IN CLOSING ON THIS PANEL I JUST WANT TO ALSO THINK- FALL AND- ALLEN- AND THE COMMUNITY FOR YOUR- STRONG ADVOCACY AROUND THE- TANAMI. REPORTED BEING ABLE TO GET AN AGREEMENT TO WHERE YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO OPERATE THAT AIRPORT IN A WAY THAT- CONTINUES TO SEE IT GROW AND BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY AND THE RESOURCES OF THIS COMMUNITY I KNOW AS- HAVING SERVED ON AIRPORT AUTHORITY FOR TWENTY YEARS. OUR RECORD IT IS IN TERMS OF AN ECONOMIC ENGINE FOR THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME CONTROL AND- HOW THE BILL YOU TO PLAN EFFECTIVELY THAT INTEGRATES INTO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. SO LET ME THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IF YOU CAN STICK AROUND TO THE- Q. AND A FROM THE PUBLIC WE WOULD- MAY NEED TO CALL ON YOU TO ANSWER A QUESTION OR TWO. THANK YOU. OUR SECOND PANEL WILL DISCUSS THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AND THEIR ROLE IN REACHING CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. MS SUZANNE HEY DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH WILL DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF CALL OF QUALITY EQUITY AND AFFORDABILITY AND THE NEXUS OF HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION. MISTER WESLEY BROUGHT HIM IN SPECIAL PROGRAMS DIRECTOR AT ACTIVE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY WILL SPEAK TO THE NECESSITY OF ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND PROMOTING ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNORS GOVERNMENT'S MR CALL MAY I DO SAY WILL SHARE THE REGIONAL PLANNING GOALS AND VISION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THE TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING NEEDS. WE'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR PANEL AND IF YOU CAN PRINT. PRESENT IN THE ORDER THAT YOU WERE- ACKNOWLEDGE. WE WILL START OUR PANEL TO. NO WAY MILLION. SURE. TESTING HELLO TESTING. AS CHAIR HOLDEN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING SUZANNE HAGUE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AND I'M HERE THIS MORNING REPRESENTING BOTH OPR AS WELL AS THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW- MY OFFICE- PR AND THE STC WORK HAND IN GLOVE HAS SORT OF THE POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION ARMS OF SUSTAINABLE EQUITABLE GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AB YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND GO AHEAD WITH THAT- SO I WAS ASKED TO COME AND SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT- THE STATE'S VANTAGE POINT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABLE EQUITABLE GROWTH AS WELL AS WHAT THE STRATEGIC ROTH COUNCIL IS DOING TO IMPLEMENT SUCH GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THIS NARRATIVE REALLY STARTS FOR MANY OF US WITH OUR- STATUTORY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS WHICH AS MANY IN THE ROOM NO- WILL REQUIRE MORE BETTER AND FASTER CLIMATE SOLUTIONS IN ORDER TO REACH THOSE TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FIFTY TARGETS. HAD AND THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED TRANSFERRED. OF COURSE THE LARGEST SHARE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE STATE REPRESENTING OVER HALF OF GHG EMISSIONS. NEXT IN ADDITION UNFORTUNATELY VEHICLE MILES OF TRAVEL OR BE AND HE IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION- UP PER CAPITA RATHER THAN. DOWN AND HAS BEEN FOR SOME YEARS. AND AS MANY KNOW CALIFORNIA IS PROJECTED TO ADD TEN MILLION NEW RESIDENTS- PRESUMABLY WHO WILL NEED TO LIVE PLACES AND WORKPLACES AND GO LOTS OF PLACES AND- HOPEFULLY NOT ADD TOO MUCH TO THAT. THE M. T. INCREASE THAT WE SAW ON THE LAST SLIDE. THE FUTURE CALIFORNIA WILL BE OUT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIVERSE IN TERMS OF RACE AND ETHNICITY AS WELL AS OLDER SO AT THESE GRAPHS REPRESENTS- AGE BRACKETS FROM YOUNGEST ON THE BOTTOM TWO OLDEST ON THE TOP AND YOU CAN SEE. THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW THAT THE TOP PART IS SIGNIFICANTLY WIDENING SO WE'LL HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT POPULATION- SORT OF STRATA GUIDE- AND AS IS NO SECRET HOUSING PRODUCTION IN THE STATE IS NOT KEEPING PACE WITH DEMAND SO THE RED ARROW THERE IS THE ANNUAL PROJECTED PRODUCTION PRODUCTION AND DEMAND. I NEEDED AND THE BAR GRAPHS REPRESENT THE ACTUAL HOUSING PERMITTED ON THE GROUND AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOMES ARE THE MOST SCARCE HOUSING TYPE SO ON THE LEFT YOU SEE. THE DEMAND FOR VERY LOW AN EXTREMELY LOW- AREA MEDIAN INCOME HOUSING FOR RENTAL RENTER HOME OWNERS AS GUINEA RENTER HOUSEHOLDS. AND ON THE RIGHT YOU SEE THE SUPPLIED THE NUMBER OF HOMES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT THOSE INCOME STRATA WITH. THE RED SHAPE REPRESENTING A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT GAP THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS HAS DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS BY RACE AND ETHNICITY SO HERE WE SEE HOUSING COSTS BURDEN- DISAGGREGATED BY RACE. SOME STARK CONTRAST AND- MOST- GROWTH IN THE STATE IS PROJECTED IN THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO WE SEE THE MAP REPRESENTS IN YELLOW- THE TOP. 25% OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE AND THE GRAY SHADED AREAS REPRESENTING PROJECTED HOUSEHOLD GROWTH. THERE IS A SPATIAL MISMATCH BETWEEN JOBS AND HOUSING SO ON THE LEFT MAP YOU SEE THAT JOBS ARE CONCENTRATED ON THE COAST AND ON THE RIGHT YOU SEE THAT PROJECTED HOUSING GROWTH IS LARGELY CONCENTRATED INLAND. ONE OF THE- THE RESULTS OF THIS PHENOMENON IS THAT SUPER COMMUTERS ARE ON THE RISE THESE ARE FOLKS WHO TRAVEL MORE THAN NINETY MINUTES EACH WAY TO GET TO A JOB. AND THIS SNAPSHOT IS FROM THE BAY AREA BUT I KNOW WELL THAT THIS PHENOMENON IS ALIVE AND WELL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL- THE LATEST NUMBER I SAW FROM THE CITY OF PALMDALE IS AT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE TRAVEL EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THEIR CARS. TO THE LA BASIN AND THEN BACK AGAIN IN THE EVENING. I TRANSPORTATION OF COURSE INCREASES THE HOUSEHOLD COST BURDEN- PARTICULARLY IN LOWER DENSITY COMMUNITIES SO THAT CHART SHOWS. THE PERCENTAGE. OF TOTAL HOUSING PLUS TRANSPORTATION COSTS TO AREA MEDIAN INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. I APOLOGIZE THAT SOME OF MY FORMATTING GOT A LITTLE BIT. THE VISTA MISINTERPRETED HERE BUT- BUT THE THAT TAKE AWAY IS THAT SOME OF THE- LESS DENSE COMMUNITIES TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE ON THAT CHART HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST- HOUSEHOLD BURDEN WHEN YOU COMBINE HOUSING. AND TRANSPORTATION COST LOOKED AT ANOTHER WAY- THIS IS A TOOL THAT MEASURES AFFORDABILITY IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS SO ON THE LEFT WE SEE A TRADITIONAL DEFINITION OF HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AT 30% OF MEDIAN INCOME AND THE MAP SHOWS A MAP OF THIS AREA SO YOU CAN SEE ON TERRIO WHERE WE ARE IN THE BOTTOM LEFT OF THAT MAP- THE YELLOW AREAS ARE AREAS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AT 30% OF INCOME FOR HOUSING. WHEN YOU ADD TRANSPORTATION COSTS- FOR A COMBINED TOTAL OF 45% OF AREA MEDIAN INCOME THE AREAS OF AFFORDABILITY SHRINK CONSIDERABLY. SO WE NEED TO EXPAND HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION CHOICES IN LOCATION EFFICIENT AREAS WITH A FOCUS ON EQUITY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO HOW ARE WE DOING THIS- WE HAVE A LOT OF- POLICY MEASURES IN PLACE BUT IN PARTICULAR IS ASKED TO THE TO FOCUS ON THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL AS A MODEL FOR AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE EQUITABLE GROWTH. IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH US DO YOU SEE THIS IS OUR OUR OUR COUNCIL EFFECTIVELY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPRISES. SIX STATE AGENCIES SECRETARIES THREE APPOINTED PUBLIC MEMBERS- MY BOSS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS THE CHAIR OF THE COUNCIL. AND ALL HIGH LATE IN PARTICULAR ARE GRANT PROGRAMS- WE HAVE FOUR SEPARATE GRANT PROGRAMS- TOTALING OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR- TO FUND A HOST OF INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AROUND AFFORDABLE AND EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. IN PARTICULAR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM IS AN INNOVATIVE- PROGRAM IS GOING INTO ITS FIFTH CYCLE THAT FUNDS INTEGRATED HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS SO WE REQUIRE. PROJECT PROPONENTS TO COME TO US WITH WITH A HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION PROJECT THAT IS AS ONE MANY OF THESE PROJECT PROPONENTS HAVE NEVER MET EACH OTHER OR TALK TO EACH OTHER WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT IS BECAUSE I NEVER HAD TO- BUT ONE OF THE OUTCOMES OF THE GRANT PROGRAM IN ADDITION TO THE PROJECTS THAT WE ACTUALLY END UP FUNDING. IS THIS IS DIANE RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS SILOS AND ACROSS PARTNERS WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES- A HIGH LATE TO THAT- WE FIND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL LAND PRESERVATION WHAT WE OFTEN CALL. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN OF INFILL DEVELOPMENT IS OF COURSE PRESERVATION OF NATURAL WORKING LANDS- AND THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES HAS BEEN A REAL SIGNATURE PROGRAM FOR US AS WELL THAT. COMBINES MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND CAPACITY BUILDING AT A LOCAL LEVEL IN THE TOP FIVE TO SPUR OF PERCENT OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WHEN I HAD A ALSO THAT. WE HAVE SEVERAL PASSED THE BUILDING- PROGRAM. INCLUDING IN PART THANKS TO SENATOR GIVE US LEADERSHIP ON SPEED TEN SEVENTY UP NEW PRO FOR. ON REGION LIMA COLLABORATIVE WITH WERE X. ABOUT. ALL IT YOU SEE THE PROGRAM OF BUT AS SORT OF WITH A NATION TO COMMITMENT TO. WE PRAY. IN ALL OF OUR GRANDSON TECH ASSISTANCE WORK LOW INCOME IN DOES IT COMMUNITY WERE ALSO VERY PROUD TO HAVE ADOPTED THE FIRST EVER PUBLIC FACING. RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLAN JUST LAST YEAR SUMMER IMPACT INCLUDES EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT NINETY SIX MILLION- INVESTED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. OVER NINE THOUSAND AFFORDABLE HOMES CREATED US SEVERAL MILLION TONS OF CARBON EMISSIONS ELIMINATED FROM THE STATE AND THEN SOME. AND I WANTED TO GIVE YOU JUST A BRIEF SNAPSHOT OF WHAT ARE PROJECTS LOOK LIKE ON THE GROUND SO THIS IS A PROJECT CALLED ERRO HEAD GROVE IN ST BERNARD YOU KNOW IT WILL CREATE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR UNITS OF AFFORDABLE OF HOUSING 80% OF WHICH WILL BE AFFORDABLE AND HAS A CLEAN ENERGY COMPONENT. AND IT ALSO HAS TWO MILES OF BIKE LANES. CONNECTING THE PROJECTS TO EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE HALF MILE OF SIDEWALKS IN TWO NEW BUS SHELTERS. FIVE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES HAS TO INVESTMENTS AND- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WERE VERY EXCITED AND PROUD OF. ONE RIGHT HERE IN ONTARIO IS CALLED ON TERRIO TOGETHER- THIS. PROJECT HAS BEEN THE RECIPIENT OF THIRTY FIVE MILLION AND STATE INVESTMENTS COUPLED WITH. OVER SIXTEEN MILLION AND LOCAL LEVERAGE FUNDS. IT INCLUDES FIFTEEN IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS WHO ARE LOCAL OUR PARTNERS- PROJECT PROPONENTS WORKING VERY CLOSELY IN COORDINATION TOGETHER- TO INVEST IN HOUSING TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- AND- THINGS LIKE BIKE MILE. BIKE LANE MILES AND SIDEWALK IMPROVEMENTS. I LIKE WISEMAN WHAT'S WE HAVE A PROJECTS- ALSO WITH A THIRTY FIVE MILLION TCC INVESTMENT FROM THE STATE WHICH HAS LEVERAGED ALMOST A HUNDRED AND NINE EXCUSE ME A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE MILLION IN LOCAL LEVERAGE FUNDS- SEVENTEEN COMMUNITY PARTNERS COMING TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS PROJECT- PROP POSSIBLE. IT INCLUDES EXCUSE ME. AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS- ELECTRIC BUS- SERVICE AND INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING THE PURCHASE OF THOSE- THOSE ZERO EMISSION BUSES VAN POOL AND CAR SHARING AND OVER FOUR THOUSAND NEW TREES BEING PLANTED. I HOPE THAT GIVES YOU JUST A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF SORT OF OUR VANTAGE POINT FROM THE STATE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WHY WE VIEW SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE COMMUNITIES AS BEING VITAL TO THE STATE'S FUTURE. AND WHAT WE THINK THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE ON THE GROUND AND HOW WERE OR WALKING THE WALK IN COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SIX GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS WES REMAIN WITH- ACTIVESYNC GABRIEL VALLEY WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE FOR THOSE WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH US WE ARE A PLACE BASED COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION STARTED IS THE ALL VOLUNTEER COMMUNITY COALITION IN TWENTY TEN AND NOW WE HAVE A REALLY DEDICATED PASSIONATE AND DIVERSE STAFF THAT REFLECTS REALLY THE RICHNESS OF THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY IN EAST LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE ARE SMALL ORGANIZATION. BUT THERE ARE MANY GROUPS OF ALL DIFFERENT SIZES WORKING ON THE SAME ISSUES THAT I'LL BE SHARING TODAY WE'RE REALLY FORTUNATE TO HAVE AMAZING PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS OTHER TRANSPORTATION JUSTICE IN MOBILITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE WORK HAND IN HAND WITH ACROSS THE STATE. AND AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER STATED- TRANSPORTATION IS REALLY CLIMATE ACTION IF WE ARE GOING TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AND IN TWENTY THIRTY MAJOR TWENTY TWENTY GOALS WE NEED TO ADDRESS- THE OUR MOBILITY SECTOR AND IT'S OVER THE OIL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. EMISSIONS SO IT'S A IT'S A HUGE HUGE CHALLENGE. AND IT'S GETTING WORSE UNFORTUNATELY WORK WE'RE DOING BETTER IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER SECTOR EXCEPT SECTOR AND THAT'S THAT'S VERY PROBLEMATIC I KNOW US LOCALLY AND MANY OTHER GROUPS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND- IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US. ONE OF THE FACTORS HERE WHICH I THINK IS JUST COMING TO THE FOREFRONT MORE RECENTLY CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD RECENTLY ACKNOWLEDGE THIS BUT- THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD ARE BUYING LARGER AND LESS FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES EVEN ASKED HAS LINE ALL THESE ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE BECOMING AVAILABLE- THESE LARGER ON TRUCKS AND CARS. ARE SINGLE HANDEDLY TORPEDOING OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR CHRONICLES. AND THEY'RE ALSO OTHER CONCERNS IS PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC SAFETY ABOUT STV'S WHICH I'LL TALK TO ABOUT A LITTLE LATER- THEY ARE MORE DANGEROUS FOR EVERYONE OUTSIDE OF A CAR IF A CHILD OR AN OLDER ADULT IS STRUCK BY A HIGHER PROFILE VEHICLE. YOU WILL NOT ROLL OVER THE HOOD OF THAT VEHICLE ON AND THE OUTCOMES ARE ARE. FAR FAR GRIMMER FOR FOLKS INVOLVED IN. A COLLISION TO THOSE VEHICLES. ANOTHER SLIGHT JUST KIND OF ILLUSTRATES HOW EXPONENTIALLY DIFFERENT IT IS DEPENDING ON HOW WE'RE MOVING AROUND OUR COUNTY SO IF YOU'RE MOVING AROUND IN A LARGE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE SUV ON YOUR OWN. URINATING YOU KNOW. FAR FAR MORE THAN IF YOU'RE ON A BUS OR IF YOU'RE WALKING. SO HOW DO WE REDUCE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED THERE'S LOTS OF EMPHASIS ON THIS- REPLACING CAR TRIPS AS WELL AS PLACING HOUSING CLOSER TO JOBS IN TRANSIT LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING A WALK TO WORK OR A SHORT BUS RIDE TO WORK BUT IT WITHOUT HOUSING CLOSE TO JOBS THAT'S JUST NOT FEASIBLE. ELECTRIFYING TRANSPORTATION WE'RE SEEING THIS IS REALLY AN AMAZING TREND THE LAST FIVE YEARS- ALL MANNER OF BICYCLES YOU KNOW AND LARGER VEHICLES ARE ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN ELECTRIC AND THEN IT IMPROVING. ALSO HAVE TO BE MORE EFFICIENT VEHICLES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT HELPING US ON THIS AS WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN THE WORLD AND WE ARE THANKFUL THAT YOU ALL ARE PUSHING BACK. SO I WANTED TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THERE SOME AMAZING THINGS HAPPENING IN OUR PART OF THE COUNTY ARE PART OF THE WORLD. FOOTHILL TRANSIT NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED FIRST IN THE NATION WILL BE ALL ELECTRIC BY TWENTY THIRTY. THEY'RE SETTING THE STANDARD FOR EVERYONE ELSE. AS SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS ALSO DOING AN AMAZING JOB THEY HAVE SECURED A NUMBER OF GRANTS TO. ADVANCE TO STAND WILL ABILITY INCLUDING THE FIRST REGIONAL ELECTRIC BIKE SHARE PROGRAM IN THE STATE FIFTEEN CITIES HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING IN THIS. I'M REALLY INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY ELECTRIC BIKES IF YOU NEVER TRIED ONE EASIER THAN A SKATEBOARD TO USE FOR OLDER ADULTS- YEAH. EASIER THAN SCOOTERS MUCH MORE FORGIVING AND THE HILL YOU KNOW THEY TACKLE HILLS GREAT AND IF IT'S A HOT DAY IT'S ALSO OFTEN USED. I LOVE USING THEM I TAKE MY SON TO SCHOOL COUPLE DAYS A WEEK ON ELECTRIC BIKE SO. LET US KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TRY ONE THESE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER ONCE AND YOUNGER MILLENNIALS- ARE INCREASINGLY USING SCOOTERS AND OTHER- ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO GET AROUND WE SHOULD EMBRACE THAT WE DON'T ALL NEED TO USE THE SAME THING TO GET AROUND. HOWEVER STILL THE GREEN AND THE BEST FOR OUR HEALTH AND ALL SORTS OF OUTCOMES IS. WALKING AND BIKING AND JUST GETTING AROUND ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET. LOTS OF MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS IS THE HEALTH BENEFITS ENVIRONMENTAL DOWN BENEFITS. THANKS LINE. SOMERS TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT OUR ORGANIZATION REALLY FOCUSES ON IS- COMPLETE STREETS MORE SUSTAINABLE STREETS AND GREENER STREETS. ON THE CONCEPT IS JARGON BUT IT BASICALLY MEANS WE'VE DONE ONE THING FOR SEVENTY YEARS AND THAT'S DESIGNED STREETS PRIMARILY JUST TO MOVE ONE TYPE OF USER. WE REALLY NEED TO BE WORKING MORE HOLISTICALLY AND LOOKING AT ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF USER GROUPS INCLUDING. PEOPLE ON FOOT NOW TRANSPORTATION DELIVERING AND ON IN PUBLIC TRANSIT. SO TALK ABOUT CROSS DESIGNER OF THE STUFF DOES NOT TO COME A TON OF MONEY AND MANY OF YOU I KNOW TRAVEL ALL OVER THE STATE AND PROBABLY HAVE NOTICED SOME OF THESE THINGS EVERY COMMUNITY. FOR THE MOST PART APPROACH THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY. GOOD THE NEXT SLIDE I'VE US NICE EXAMPLES HERE SO THIS IS STANDARD CROSSWALK YOU SEE THIS IN MOST CITIES IN CALIFORNIA- AND TO GO TO THE NEXT SIDE THIS IS. AN EXAMPLE SIMPLE- CONTINENTAL CROSSWALK WITH THE CURVE EXTENSION MAKING THAT CROSSING DISTANCE A LITTLE BIT SHORTER. EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO GET ACROSS YOU CAN GET THE NEXT TIME YOU CAN GET- ARTISTIC WITH THESE TO THE PLAYHOUSE DISTRICT ASSOCIATION IN AND PASADENA HAS. HAS AN AMAZING ARTISTIC CROSSWALK PROGRAM THEY'VE HIRED LOCAL ARTISTS TO DESIGN THESE TEMPLATES AND THEY USE THEM THROUGHOUT THEIR DISTRICT TO REALLY GIVE IT. A CERTAIN UNIQUE FEEL AND IT ALSO ADDS TO SAFETY. LAST COUPLE YEARS. PEDESTRIAN START. SOME PEOPLE CAUGHT EARLY WALKED TIMING THE PLANNERS CALL IT A AND L. P. I. A LEADING PEDESTRIAN INTERVAL. ESSENTIALLY GIVES- PEDESTRIAN A COUPLE SECONDS HEAD START GETTING ACROSS THE INTERSECTION BEFORE THE LIGHT TURNS GREEN SO. REDUCING US RIGHT TURNING CONFLICTS THIS CALL VERY LITTLE MONEY BUT- HAS TREMENDOUS BENEFITS FOR SAFETY. AND MICHAEL MOBILITY LANE SO FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT BIKE LANES BUT- AND SO MANY MORE PEOPLE USE THESE THAN JUST PEOPLE ON BIKES. SO PEOPLE ON SCOOTERS AND SKATEBOARDS AND ALL THESE HE WHEELS AND DIFFERENT THINGS YOU SEE MORE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT ARE COMING DOWN HERE. THE LOCAL EXAMPLE AND CLAREMONT THE LOWER PICTURE FOOTHILL BOULEVARD IT JUST REDESIGNED THE STREET SPACE A BIT INCLUDED STORM WATER CAPTURE MORE STREET TREES- SO MULTI BENEFIT REDESIGN OF THE STREET SO MOVING VEHICLES HELPING EVERYONE GET AROUND SICK MORE SAFELY. THREE TREES- TREMENDOUS BENEFITS FOR A WALK ABILITY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH FOR THE ENVIRONMENT- AND- YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THE LOWEST COST THINGS YOU CAN DO AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT ON. AND HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE FROM THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CITY TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS A LOT OF OUR STREETS LOOK LIKE THIS NOT A LOT OF AMENITIES. NEXT SLIDE. WILL SHOW A REDESIGNED WITH STREET TREES WITH AN ELEVATED CROSSWALK WITH THE SAFETY ALLEN IN THE MIDDLE SO YOU DON'T NEED TO RUN ACROSS THE WHOLE STREET ONCE BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE STOPS FOR US WHEN WE- MUST WALK. I AND THEN SOME OF THE OTHER BENEFITS AND WE TALKED ABOUT PHYSICAL NOW. ONE IS MENTAL HEALTH AGING IN PLACE OUR SENIORS SO THEY CAN GET AROUND WITHOUT A CAR NOT ALWAYS YOU CAN BE ABLE TO DRIVE FOR EVER- ON. PERSONAL FINANCE. SICK AND IT'S ABOUT SIX GRAND A YEAR TO HAVE A CAR WHEN YOU ADD UP INSURANCE TICKETS PARKING EVERYTHING ELSE. AIR QUALITY BENEFITS QUALITY OF LIFE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MORE WALKABLE VIBRANT DOWNTOWN TO DO BETTER ECONOMICALLY. JOBS WHEN YOU INVEST IN THESE TYPES OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE MUCH MORE. LABOR INTENSIVE SO FIXING SIDEWALKS IMPROVING SUCH LOCAL STREETS CREATES MORE JOBS THAN FOR EXAMPLE PUTTING ANOTHER LANE ON THE FREEWAY- PUBLIC SAFETY AND THIS. THAT'S WHAT I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ON NOW. IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS BUT TRAFFIC VIOLENCE REMAINS A HUGE PROBLEM WE ARE AT A TWENTY FIVE YEAR HIGH RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF FATALITIES. OF PEOPLE ARE. RIDING BICYCLES AND WALKING IN THE STATE. A ONE OF THE FACTORS HERE IS THOSE LARGER VEHICLES WE HAVE MORE HAVE YOUR VEHICLES ON THE STREETS WHEN THEY HIT PEOPLE THEY DO A LOT OF DAMAGE. AND THE OTHER ISSUE IS OF COURSE EVERYONE HAS A SMARTPHONE NOW. AND IF YOU'RE OPERATING HEAVY VIA AND PAYING IT. THAT CAN BE DEBT TO. SO THESE ARE JUST ACCEPT I KNOW WE HAVE A LIST THE LAST TWO YEARS OF PEOPLE PREDOMINANTLY PEOPLE WALKING KILLED AND IT OVERWHELMINGLY IMPACT. CHILDREN IN OLDER ADULTS. WHO OFTEN DEPEND ON WALKING TO GET AROUND- CRASHING ON ACCIDENT- MANY OF THESE COLLISIONS FATAL COLLISIONS THAT WE CAN'T WE HAVE TO STOP CALLING THEM ACCIDENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE. OFTEN PREVENTABLE WITH BETTER DESIGN WITH BETTER EDUCATION. HI IF YOU CAN ADVANCE TO SLIDE. ABOUT 18% OF TRIPS IN CALIFORNIA BY FOOTER BIKE 40% OF FATALITIES ARE PEOPLE DOING EITHER OF THOSE THINGS AND WE WERE TRYING TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO GET AROUND BY PUTTING MY WE WORK WITH A LOT OF YOUTH. AND IT'S PARTICULARLY NOW MONEY CENTER SAYING YOUR BILL VALLEY A LOT OF THESE. YOUTH ARE ARE FROM. THIS COMMUNITIES AND THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY- VULNERABLE TO BEING KILLED WHILE WALKING AROUND THEIR CITIES. AND ONE OF THE REASONS THIS IS AGAIN HISTORIC UNDER INVESTMENT SO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THEM HAVE SIDEWALKS HAVE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH SIDEWALKS VERSES AND ALMOST 90% OF HIGH INCOME COMMUNITIES. SO THE LAST I KNOW EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT BUDGET AND IF YOU BROUGHT YOUR CHECKBOOK- I'M NO DIFFERENT. I WILL HIGHLIGHT THAT LESS THAN TRANSPORTATION SPENDING IS INVESTING IN WALKING AND BICYCLING PROJECTS AND OTHER ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS- MEANWHILE ABOUT BIKE. AND CALTRANS AS A GOAL BUT I BELIEVE TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TO DOUBLE THAT SO WE WANT TO GET TO THIRTY FIVE PERCENT- TRIPS BY PUT HER BIKE IN ORDER TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND MANY OF OUR OTHER GOALS. AND TALK A QUICK ABOUT ONE PROGRAM SO THAT THE BIGGEST PROGRAM TO FUND THESE THINGS IN CALIFORNIA AT THE STATE LEVEL TO THE CALIFORNIA ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. YOU'VE HAD FOUR CYCLES OF THIS SO FAR AND- NOW IT'S EVERY TWO YEARS. THE YELLOW BARS TO SHOWCASE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING REQUESTED BY CITIES. THE GREEN BARS HOW MUCH FUNDING IS AVAILABLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU CAN SEE WAS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE- NOT MANY CITIES RECEIVE THIS FUNDING- AND CYCLE FIVE IT HAS INCREASED MUCH- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE SEEING OUR ORGANIZATION AS HELP CITIES FOR MANY YEARS. APPLYING FOR THESE GRANTS. IS THAT. AFTER APPLYING ONCE OR TWICE CITIES JUST STOP. BECAUSE THEY REALIZE IT'S TOO HARD AND IT TAKES. HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS TO SUBMIT THESE THINGS OR THEY HAVE TO HIRE PROFESSIONAL- CONSULTANTS TO SUBMIT THE PROPOSALS. AND IF YOU DON'T GET FUNDED YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KEEP DOING IT SO I THINK. THE REQUESTED FUNDING WOULD BE EVEN HIGHER IF. IF THEY WERE BETTER SHOT THAT FOR CITIES TO GET THESE THINGS FUNDED. SO QUICK EXAM CYCLE FOR THESE ARE THE PROJECT THAT WERE SOME IN EAST LA ANGELES COUNTY. SO DIAMOND BAR TO RTL MONEY LA COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS SUBMITTED TEN. LEAVE PROJECTS COUNTY WIDE THEY DID NOT GET A SINGLE PROJECT FUNDED WHICH IS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE AND THERE ARE HUGE INSTITUTION WITH. ALL THE EXPERTISE AND MANPOWER TO SUBMIT THE THINGS AND KEEP ADVANCING THE SLIDES SO I LOVE PLENTY LOOKING OUT OF FLINTRIDGE MONROVIA MONTEREY PARK PASADENA AT POMONA SUBMITTED TO PROPOSALS ROSE MEETS OMITTED TO PROPOSE A SOUTH OF MONEY. ONLY TWO OF NINETEEN WERE FUNDED. AND JUST KIND OF IN A NUTSHELL HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS THE BECOME FOR CITIES AND MANY THE CITIES ARE GOING TO APPLY AGAIN IN TWENTY TWENTY BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED THE MOST RECENT. TIME SO WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE A COUPLE CITIES GET FUNDING BUT THE SAME TIME IT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. AN EXCELLENT. IT'S TWENTY TWENTY I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WHAT VOTERS THINK ABOUT THESE ISSUES SO IN TWENTY SIX TEEN ONE MEASURE AND MUST PASS LOS ANGELES COUNTY AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION DID POLLING OF VOTERS ON DIFFERENT TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS I'D SAY FOR OUT THE SCHOOL MAKING OUR SCHOOL SAFER FOR KIDS TO GET TO- IS VERY POPULAR AMONGST VOTERS SAME THING WITH THE CROSSWALK IMPROVEMENTS- I THINK ALL OF US ARE PEDESTRIAN AT SOME POINT I THINK MANY OF US OF EXPERIENCES FIRSTHAND THAT IT ISN'T SAFE ENOUGH TO WALK ACROSS TOO MANY OF OUR STREETS. AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO A RELATIVELY LOW COST SO- WITH THAT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AN INVITATION SPEAK TODAY WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE PEOPLE CONTACT US IF YOU LIKE TO COME DOWN MONEY ARE ALSO HAPPY TO SHOWCASE OUR CENTER WHICH IS IN WHICH INCLUDES- THE COMMUNITY BICYCLE PARK AND THE TRAFFIC GARDEN WHERE WE TEACH A SAFETY CLASSES. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THE MORE ARCHER HOLDEN AND MEMBER AND SAY LEYVA ARE RELIEVED THE INVITATION TO BE A MY NAME IS AND EXECUTIVES OF LOOKS LIKE SKY IS ISN'T PLANNING ORGANIZATION FOR THE REGION ARE A THREE I ALWAYS JOKE THAT I TO USE OF THE AND MY JOB. BECAUSE BECAUSE THIS STYLE THE STORY OF HOW HOW ABOUT OUR REGION IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND WHY WE THIS OF THE REGION ZERO WE HAVE ON HAVE PUBLIC OF THE STATE YOU KNOW SEE COUNTY ARE ARE ARGUES INCLUDING NINETY CITY AND IN THE SIX COUNTIES. IN TERMS. WITH ABOUT NINETEEN MILLION PEOPLE. TO SPEAK ORDER. FOR ALL RIGHT NEXT RIGHT BOB JUST TO GO NEED ON THAT ON THAT FOR A SLICE WE THE WORK DO AT AT SKY RE DO WE OF ALL OF LOCAL COORDINATING LOW ISSUE WE ALWAYS ALWAYS ARE TONE IT'S THAT THE BEST IS REALLY THE LOW GOVERNMENT CITY AND COUNTY GO. BECAUSE THAT'S WITH THAT TO LIVE DIRECTLY THE PEOPLE AS IMPORTANT THAT WORK IS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT STATE GO AND NAY OUR SO GOVERNMENT ALL BE IMPORTANT AND YOU ALL ARE HERE FOR THAT AND WE FIND OURSELVES IN A NICHE THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE WHERE WERE TACKLE THINGS THAT ARE DONE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN A SINGLE JURISDICTION AND THESE OTHER REGIONAL ISSUES THAT YOU ARE CALLING US TO SPEAK TO TODAY. ABOUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO ARTS GUY WILL PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENT WOULD PRODUCE IS THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT'S REQUIRED BUT BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW HOW WE DO THIS EVERY FOUR YEARS AND WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR CURRENT UPDATE WHICH IS A TWENTY TWENTY UPDATE. HOW WE CALL THE CAN OKAY BECAUSE INTO IS TO RE. GET A THE FIVE THAT WE HAVE A REGION. THAT IS LIKE I SAID THE MOST THAT CAN VIABLE REGION BECAUSE OF JUST LA- BUT BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE REGION COMING TOGETHER AND GETTING NEEDED TOGETHER. AND SO THAT ELEMENT OF CONNECTIVITY IS IMPORTANT AND THAT WAS THE END OF THE NATURE OF THE CONVERSATION YOU HEARD. ON THE FIRST PANEL WE ACTUALLY DID A CONNECTIVITY STUDY BETWEEN LA AND SOMEBODY YOU KNOW THAT WAS ALLUDED TO. EARLIER ON. IN THIS LONG RANGE PLAN WHAT IT IS REALLY MORE OF A VISION FOR THE REGION. IT'S NOT A MANDATE HOWEVER IT DOES PROVIDE. OF VERY DATA DRIVEN- FACT BASED- BASIS FOR WHERE WE THINK WE SHOULD GO AS A REGION. ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH STATE GOALS- STATE SUSTAINABILITY AND- AND LIVABILITY GOALS WE HAVE TO ASSURE THAT THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE PLAN OF FINANCIALLY CONSTRAINED OTHERWISE WE JUST DON'T MAKE THINGS UP- SO THE POLICIES AND STRATEGIES IN THE PLANT. AND THE PROJECTS IN THE PLAN HAVE TO- HAVE A REASONABLY A SHORT FUNDING OVER THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF THE PLAN LIFE. OUR STATE REQUIREMENT ON THE SP THREE SEVEN FIVE OFFICE ALSO REQUIRES US THAT THESE PLANS SHOW AND DEMONSTRATE. HOW WE ACHIEVE REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY FIVE OUR TARGET IN THIS REGION IS FIVE FROM THE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE LEVELS- ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL OUR PLAN HAS TO BE IN CONFORMITY WITH HER CLEAN AIR ACT. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE ARE WE ALSO STRIVE TO ACCOMPLISH NEXT LINE. WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGE AND YOU ARE NEW TO JOHN IN THIS I THINK SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN ALREADY ARTICULATED SO I'M NOT GONNA. DO A MUCH ON IT- VERY SIGNIFICANT IN OUR REGION OBVIOUSLY IS THE FACT THAT WE KNOW WE'RE GROWING WE'RE GOING TO GROW BY ABOUT FOUR MILLION THE PLAN. AND THE PLAN PERIOD- WE ARE GOING TO. AS A RESULT HAVE- INCREASING DEMAND ON OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. WE HAVE A DECLINE IN TRYING TO RIDERSHIP. I'D SAY IN TIME WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THAT TRANSIT IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR MOBILITY IN THIS REGION. ESPECIALLY ON THE ON THE LONG HALLS AND SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN TRANSIT WE HAVE TO ARREST THE DECLINE IN TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IN THAT. REST WE ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE FACT WE THE SYSTEM WE HAVE- THAT WE ARE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE OUR FUTURE SYSTEM MOST OF IT IS ALREADY HERE IN TERMS OF HIGHWAYS FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN A BILL NINETY MORE BUT WHAT WE HAVE WE ALSO HAVE TO BE VERY EFFICIENT AND HOW WE USE THEM. AND THAT REQUIRES SOME FUNDING. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IS HOW WE COORDINATE. LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION WHY WE DON'T HAVE LAND USE AUTHORITY AT THE REGIONAL. LEVEL AT THIS GAG LEVEL WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH A LAND USE AUTHORITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE MAKE IN- OUR WORDS COLOCATION EFFICIENCY- LOCATION- SHOPPER LAND USE DECISIONS WHERE WE'RE WE'RE MAKING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT THE- THE ESSENCE OF OUR- OF OUR OF OUR PLANET. OUR OUR PLAN WAS PREDICATED ON THIS TEN GOALS THAT OUR BOARD- REVIEWED AND ADOPTED THAT ALLOWED US TO BASICALLY BE TO BE THE PREDICATE FOR THE PLAN THAT WE RELEASED. LAST NOVEMBER. ARE THE PLAN WAS IN CIRCULATION FOR FIFTY FIVE DAYS- FOR COMMENT. AND THOSE WHO FIVE DAYS ENDED ON THE TWENTY FOURTH OF JANUARY WE HAVE RECEIVED SO FAR- WHEN I CHECKED WOULD STAFF YESTERDAY. WE RECEIVED SO FAR NORTH OF THE HEART OF FIFTEEN UNDER COMMENTS. ON THE PLAN. SO WE ARE VERY GRATIFIED THAT PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO- TO THE PLANNING TO WORK NOW BEGINS TO SORT THROUGH. AUGUST COMMONS. THERE ARE TWO ESSENTIAL BUCKETS THE PLAN ON THE WRIST AND THIS REGIONAL PLAN THAT WE WORK WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDER THE TO A BUCKETS ARE WHAT WE CORD AS AND WE CORPS V. REAL MEAN A THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE THAT INTO A- AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO THOSE BECAUSE IT MAKES SO THE ARE THE CORE VISION EL OF THE TO COME TO MAINTAIN HE TALKS ABOUT MAINTAINING WE ALREADY HAVE FIXING FORCE WILL WE HAVE TALKS ABOUT EXPANDING. IN TERMS OF MOBILITY AND HOUSING AND ALSO INCREASE IN INVESTMENT IN TRANSIT INCOMPLETE STREETS THE OTHER BALK AT IS OUR ELECTRONIC THAT'S RIGHT NOW KEEP CONNECTIONS THE KEY CONNECTIONS ARE NEW THINGS THAT WE ARE BRINGING FORWARD IN THIS IN THIS PLAN THAT ADDRESS- THE OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TODAY AND LOOKING FORWARD ESPECIALLY ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT TECHNOLOGY MIGHT OFFER US AND SO HERE WE HAVE IN THIS LIKE WE HAVE A LIST OF THINGS THAT WE ADDRESS OUR SCORE VISION THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR PLAN CYCLES BACK SOME OF THESE WE PIONEERED IN OUR REGION AND HAVE BECOME MORE STATE WIDE- IN ITS ADOPTION- IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT NEWS THAT WE'RE WORSE INVEST IN TRANSIT- IT'S NOT NEWS THAT GOODS MOVEMENTS ESSENTIAL TO OUR ECONOMY IT'S ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR ECONOMY SO WE CONTINUE TO CARRY- THOSE FOR BY MAINTAINING AND ENSURING WE EAT OUT THE MOST OUT OF EXISTENCE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF DEMAND AND SYSTEM PRESERVATION AND THE SYSTEM MANAGEMENT HAVING IS ALSO IMPORTANT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE KEY. CORRECTION. ARE WE- ON WHAT TECHNO WILL DO. IN TERMS OF TRIP READ THE ONE OF THE FIVE. GROWING TREAT CHIP MÙT TO MODE. THAT WE SAW IN OUR IN OUR US. IS TO WORK AT HOME. THE MOBILE WORKING ON HOME BECAUSE OF THE UP OF THE- WE HAVE WITHIN FOLKS CAN DO MY- ABOUT WORKING AT HOME OR WORK. TO SPUR SITES THEY'RE NOT NEXT WEEK. TO FAR WE- AWAY FROM HOME. HOW AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SO. HOUSING DID. I THINK ALSO IN WE ALSO AS A MATTER OF ELEMENT IN THIS IN THIS- IN THIS- PLAN FOCUS ON. OR HOW WE MANAGE. THE SYSTEM WHERE DURING THOSE PEAK PERIODS HOW DO WE MANAGE THIS SYSTEM AS A UTILITY. MOST OF US KNOW THAT. WE DON'T WANT TO USE ELECTRICITY CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY SO WE DON'T RUN OUT WASHES AND ENERGY AND- AND HIGH CAPACITY OUR ELECTRICAL. APPLIANCES AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY BECAUSE IT'S HIGH COST WE KNOW YOU JUST KNOW THAT. HOWEVER MOST OF US DON'T THINK TWICE ABOUT JUMPING ON THE FREEWAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE IS THAT WHETHER OR NOT THAT CHIP IS IMPORTANT. HOW WE MAKE PEOPLE MAKE THAT CHOICE HE'S ONE OF BY ONE OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD IN. IN THE GOES ON DISCUSSION. MOBILITY AS A SERVICE THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE NOW- WHERE WOULD BE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN PLAN WHICH IS STILL CURRENT WE DIDN'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT UBER AND LIFT- BECAUSE IT WASN'T AS RELEVANT TODAY WE CAN'T LOOK PAST THAT. AND SO HAVING THOSE MOBILITY. CHOICES AS A SERVICE SERVING AS THE FIRST AND LAST MILE TO OUR TRANSIT SYSTEM THE TRANSIT BACKBONE AT THESE IMPORTANT. AS ONE ELEMENT OF A REQUEST IN TRANSIT THE CAR RIGHT DECLINE. AND OF COURSE AS WE FACE AGREE GAS GOALS THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE TO SERIOUSLY. LOOK AT HOW WE ACCELERATE THE. ELECTRIFICATION OF THE ENTIRE. SYSTEM OUR FROM THE PROBABILITY TO. OF A CHANCE SYSTEM AND EVEN THE SING SINGLE OF. THE. EXCITE I'M GONNA END JUST TALKING ABOUT AND SO WERE FOR I REALIZE SITE. THE ALLEGES KIM UP WITH A ONE AS AN INVESTOR IN JUMP STARTING THE HOUSING. THAT WE HAVE NO NO NEW THAT WE HAVE A CRISIS BOTH ON THE A FOUR SIDE AND ALSO ON THE HOMELESS SIDE AND DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT I THINK OF THE STATE. STATE GOVERNMENT SHOWED A JUST TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP WITH AB ONE A ONE- WE ARE- STEPPING FORWARD TO THE STATE TO- TO GO FOR EARLY OF EARLY- THE EARLY ACTION GRANT MONEY TO BEGIN TO DO MORE WORK PLANNING FOR. HOW WE ACTUALLY JUMPSTART HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND CREATING CAPACITY FOR- ULTIMATELY BENDING THE NEEDLE ARE MOVING THE NEEDLE ON ON- THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IN OUR REGION WHAT THAT GRANT MONEY DOES FOR US IS ALLOWS US TO WORK WITH EACH OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. TO HELP THEM ENERGIZED THEM GIVEN THE CAPACITY TO ONE DO THE PLANNING WE HAD WE WERE ASSIGNED A VERY HARD HIGH REMAIN THIS YEAR IF YOU OFFER WITH RE I THINK I. IS. HEY IN WE WILL PASS THE S. OF THE NUMBER WE TO KNOW IF OUT HOW ACTION BILL THOSE. NOW THIS AND COUNTIES NOT I BILL. BUT THEY'RE IN A POSITION. HELP BY IN. THOSE WHO ACTUALLY BUILD AND TO DO THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT AND SOME OF THAT IS PLANNING SOME OF THAT IS RESOURCES- IN TERMS OF CAPITAL- THE- AGENCY MONEY THAT WE GET FROM S. S. YOU SEE I THINK IS IMPORTANT. IS ONE CATALYST THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN A CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING I THINK THERE ARE OTHER IDEAS THAT WE WANT TO BRING TO THE TABLE- THROUGH THIS- EARLY ACTION ACTIVITIES THAT WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS AT A BOARD- NEXT WEEK THURSDAY. BOB OUR NEXT LIGHT MY THAT'S IT BECAUSE I WANTED TRYING KEEP THE TIME YOU TIME IS. LITTLE FASTER HERE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI CERTAINLY AGAIN APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATIONS AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT HOW THEY ARE ALL LINKED TO SUSTAINABILITY OF. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT AND HOW WE PROVIDE SKEWS ME FOR. SEEMS LIKE HOUSING AND URBAN AREAS THAT YOU CAN BUILD ON SOME OF THE THEMES THAT WERE OUTLINED IN YOUR VARIOUS REPORTS- I'M GOING TO YIELD TO MY COLLEAGUES BUT I DO WANT TO IN YOUR MIND IF YOU CAN SORT OF THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF DENSITY- AND HOW THAT PLAYS. SEES ME IN TERMS OF THE HAVING MORE PEOPLE LIVING IN DOWNTOWN SO AND TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES I KNOW IN PASADENA WE HAVE THE GOAL LINE HAS CERTAINLY PROVIDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR GENERAL PLAN- REVISIONS THAT. BRING GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OUT OF SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS IN INTO THE CORE PARTS OF THE CITIES SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I HAD A FLASHBACK TO THOSE DAYS SO- IF YOU CAN KIND OF THINK ABOUT. WHAT DENSITY ROLE THAT PLAYS IN TERMS OF- CREATING THE SUSTAINABLE STREETS AND A GREEN MOBILITY AND HOW THAT ALL COMES TOGETHER I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL- BUT ALL YOU'LL TO. CENTER LABOR. THANK YOU SORRY MUST VOICE OF AND- SO WANT TO START WITH WAS IT MISS HOW. HAGUE SORRY I WAS IN THE RESTROOM- WE JUST I JUST WAS IN THE TEAM LEYVA ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS RETURN STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WE JUST SO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO- AND ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO PARTNER WITH YOU. AND THEN ALSO TO SAY PUBLICLY HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR FUNDING SB TEN SEVENTY TWO- VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE HOPE THAT WILL DO FOR THE ENTIRE STATE- AND YOU KNOW I A ALSO JUST YOU KNOW WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT WITH HOUSING BEING CLOSE TO TRANSIT AND WHATNOT. AND AS YOU WELL KNOW WE HAD A BILL THAT WE DEBATED AND DEBATED ABOUT SEVEN HOURS OVER TWO DAYS ON THE SENATE FLOOR THING ABOUT THAT YEAH. AND YOU KNOW I'M I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT- MORE OF MY COLLEAGUES- DIDN'T DO THE RIGHT THING A VOTE FOR THE BILL SO THAT WE COULD GET IT OFF THE FLOOR AND SEND IT OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY- WE CAN CONTINUE TO PRETEND. LIKE WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING EVERYWHERE BUT WERE NOT AND YOU KNOW I'VE SAID MANY TIMES THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU LEAVE IT TO THE STATE WE MIGHT SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T LIKE- TO OUR LOCAL CITY. AND I THINK THAT SB FIVE WAS VERY- I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DID NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND IT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION AROUND IT- BUT THE I THINK IT WAS A REALLY GOOD BILL. AND I'M SORRY THAT IT DID NOT- GET OUT OF THE SENATE AND I'M SURE WE'VE GOT SOMETHING ELSE COMING BUT MY FRUSTRATION AS A LEGISLATOR IS THAT FOR SIX YEARS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOUSING. BUT NOTHING DONE NOTHING AND WHEN YOU DO POLLING- YOU WILL SEE THAT THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT THING. TO PEOPLE UP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE AND THE HOUSING ISSUE SO I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS YOU GUYS ARE OFF THE OVER THERE IN THE ASSEMBLY COULD YOU DON'T HAVE TO VOTE ON IT. BOB THAT WE SHOW A LITTLE COURAGE AND WE DO GOOD WORK AND WE DO IT TO BE DONE THIS OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF. AT TRIMS XIN. WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT WELL AND ABOUT TRANSPORTING OF US BUT SAID TWENTY WE HAVE WHERE IN ANY PLACE IN THE SO FROM A LOT OF THIS IS A HOW WE ELECT BIG RIGS WE PASSED ON TO GIVE SIGNED A TWO SO THAT WE DO HAVE SOME CHECKS ON BIG RIGS WHICH IS AND THAT WILL BE LIKE. THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND BIG RIGS OFF OF THE- OUT OF THE OFF THE ROADS- SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK MORE THAT TO NOT JUST WHAT ARE WE A SINGLE PASSENGER'S DOING BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE IF YOU KNOW AMAZON AND ALL OF THESE COMPANIES ARE THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE THAN WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE BREATHING CLEAN AIR- AND THEN THE CITIES WHO DIDN'T GET THE MONEY WILL BE IT BECAUSE I TOTALLY AGREE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO APPLY AGAIN IF IT'S TOO HARD HOW DO WE HELP WITH THAT. THAT'S FOR YOUR CHECKBOOK COMES IN. WITH ME GET IT I HAVE IT. SURE YOU JUST DON'T LIKE THE LABEL VERY WELL. OKAY SO WE JUST MORE MONEY. I IF THIS. HAS A GOAL OF DOUBLING IN BIKING IN. TRANCE AND NEEDS TO FUNDING COMMENSURATELY WITH THAT YOU KNOW WITH THAT GOAL SO WE GOT IT TO SHIFT OUR TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS IN LINE WITH. THOSE GOALS CLIMB IN AND HEALTH GOALS WE HAVE. GOT IT I AGREE THANK YOU TO EVERYONE VERY GOOD PRESENTATION. ZERO ONE MAKE A COMMENT WE SPOKE TO THAT WERE STILL PRESENT. ON IT GOES BACK TO CENTER I GOT OVER TO YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WE WORK TOGETHER- WE HAVE RESULTS AND LOOKING BACK HERE ON TERRA SINCE WARREN TO REAL. THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT WE DID THE TCC GROUNDS AS YOU CAN SEE- THE SLICE OF RARE OVER A HUNDRED NEW HOMES AFFORDABLE HOMES- HOUSING TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS WORK FOR DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT TOOK A LOT OF WORK TO GET THAT DONE I THINK- ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WE DON'T MEAN CENTER ONE A BUS TOUR REMEMBER. GOING AROUND THE AREA TALKING ABOUT. HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT- THIS AREA WHICH IS HUGE NOW. AND BRING IN THOSE TYPES OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND DEVELOPMENTS HERE- IN ONTARIO IS A LEADER WHAT THEY'VE DONE WITH THAT MONEY THEN. LOOKING BACK WE TALK ABOUT THE ROUTE THE CONNECTIVITY AND HOW THE DEVELOPMENT WORKS. PUBLIC AT- MONTCLAIR WHO'S ALSO LOOKING AT DOING A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT A REGARDING THEIR TRANSIT OR IT GOVERNMENT. TO HOLD UP. BANK WHERE. ARE ALSO ADAMANTLY WORK ON. BUILDING AND BRING MORE FOR BY HOW. AND HOME AS WELL AS JUST. TO MAKE THE COMMENTS WHAT WE'RE DO HERE IN THIS. AS WE DO ABOUT. EVERYTHING WORKING TOGETHER FOR. BENNETT OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK MISTER CHAIR I JUST TO MY I SAID A FIVE IMAGE AS FOR. BY SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU- ANY THOUGHTS ON THE ISSUE OF DENSITY AND HOW THAT. AND I GUESS THAT TO SOME DEGREE TIES IN WITH THE SENATORS COMMENT. YES CHAIR HOLDEN- I CAN START- WITH A FEW THOUGHTS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP WHAT IS KNOWN IN PLANNER CIRCLES AS THE D. WORK- WHAT IS THE ROLE OF DENSITY IN IN CREATING ALL THE USE IN FOSTERING ALL THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT I THINK AB. THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS I MEAN FIRST OF ALL DENSITIES RELATED TO A LOT OF POSITIVE OUTCOMES THAT WE TALK ABOUT US POLICY GOALS NOT JUST ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES BUT A PHYSICAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH AS WEST RIVER- REFERRED TO- ALSO JUST HUMAN HAPPINESS THERE ARE SOME REALLY INTERESTING STUDIES FROM THE WORLD OF PSYCHOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY THAT SUGGEST THAT. OUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER HUMAN BEINGS NO MATTER WHO WE ARE NO MATTER WHETHER WHERE A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN OLDER YOUNG- ETCETERA- MAKE US HAPPIER AS INDIVIDUALS EVEN IF IT'S JUST SITTING NEXT TO US SOMEBODY ON ON THE TRAIN OR THE BUSSER SO YOU KNOW BUYING YOUR GROCERIES AND SMILING ACROSS THE- THE CASH REGISTER- SO. ALL THAT TO SAY WHAT IS THE ROLE DENSITY AND IN THESE. IN THE POLICY GOALS THAT WE- I THINK IT'S AN- TO I THINK THAT AS PRO. ARE KIND OF APPROVAL CONCEPT AND WE REALIZE THAT AND WE WOULD LOVE FOR YOU ALL TO DOUBLE AND TRIPLE OUR FUNDING BECAUSE WE SEE THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE HAVING IN COMMUNITIES BUT THAT SAID. WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE AND SO WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT- THE THAT ARE PROGRAMS AS SORT OF THE CENTER OF A SERIES OF CONCENTRIC CIRCLES AND SO AS WE LEARN WHAT WORKS IN COMMUNITIES WE LIKE TO THINK ABOUT. HOW DO WE EMBED THOSE LESSONS LEARNED IN OTHER POLICIES AND OTHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AS JUST SORT OF STANDARD PRACTICE ACROSS ALL- ALL ENTITIES. AND WHAT WE SEE WITH RESPECT TO DENSITY IS THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SCARY. HOME WE SEE ARE PROJECTS AS SORT OF REALLY EYE OPENING AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVEN'T PREVIOUSLY HAD DENSITY. AND WHEN THEY COME TO THE RIBBON CUTTING AND THEY SEE WHAT DENSITY THAT YOU ARE LOOKS LIKE. IT'S SORT OF A ABA THAT'S YOU. I'D TO LIVE THERE UP THAT'S A REAL ASSET TO OUR COMMUNITY SO WE SEE THAT PART OF OUR IMPACT- I WANTED. OUR BY THE CITY OF LOS. AND WORK ON I. TO A UNITS AND ALSO OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE YOUR LEADERS ACROSS BOTH HOUSES. TO REALLY ADVANCE AN AND FOR EIGHTY PAULA THE PLANNING FOR OF LA INFORMED RECENTLY THAT- PRIOR TO THE CITY'S WORK TO ADVANCE THAT. FUNDING PERMITS. MAKING IT EASIER AND CHEAPER AND FASTER TO DO EIGHTY USE AND THEY'VE DONE A WHOLE SUITE OF. POLICY MEASURES. BEFORE THEY WERE PERMITTING AROUND A HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY USE A YEAR IN THE CITY OF THE LAKE. CALPERS UP OR OF FOUR THOUSAND A YEAR AND I IS IN EXIST IN NAME BUT- THIS. FLOOR AREA RATIO TO GET. ON YOU- IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF COMMUNITY SIGNIFICANTLY BUT ONE OF THE BENEFITS THAT THEY SEE IS OTHERS AND ADDED IN URBAN PLANNING- RETAIL FOLLOWS ROOFTOPS. SO WITH ADDITIONAL. ADDITIONAL CHEQUE BOOKS AN ADDITIONAL WALL IT'S IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SUDDENLY BUT. COOL STORY EVERYONE. IN ONE. ACTUAL WILL BE THERE'S MORE PEOPLE THAT WALK BY IT EVERY DAY RATHER MORE PEOPLE THAT TAKE THE TRAINS YOU KNOW STOP AND GET A COUPLE COFFEE ON THE WAY TO. A TO THEIR THEIR PER OF WORK IT'S ADDRESS OF. JUST A FEW THOUGHTS THE TOP OF MY OBVIOUS LOTS TO SAY. THAT HAPPY TO TRAVEL. WELL WE- WERE THINK DENSITY IS NECESSARY. ARE YOU FOR GONNA. FOR MORE. PEOPLE TO THE NINE. THAT YOU HAVE IMAGINE THAT WE TO GROW A LITTLE BIT IN THE RE. I THINK THE EAST IS HOUSE. DENSE AS OFTEN. WHEN PEOPLE GET REALLY OF ABOUT DÂN. THEY IMAGINE. SKYSCRAPERS UP IN THE NAY. AND I THAT'S REALLY. THAT OVER EXPRESS AND THOUGHT. OF THE IDEA IS TO BE ABLE TO- PROVIDE. THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO LIVE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORK FOR EXAMPLE- THE REASON YOU HAVE CITIES IN CITY CENTERS BECAUSE THERE'S DENSITY. THE REASON- CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICTS WORKERS BECAUSE OF DENSITY. HAVE THIS CATCHMENT POPULATION THAT THERE TO- BE A BIT TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF SERVICES AND- AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE GOING ON- WE WILL STILL PREDOMINANTLY HOW SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING. IN MOST OF OUR REGION AND THAT'S NOT A CHANGE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO LEAVE AND- THEN. ONE AND MAYBE- ARE THREE OR FOUR UNITS ON A CAR OR EVEN. ON ON FIVE ACRE RANCH IS STILL BE TO DO THE- HOWEVER AS WE INVEST. IN INFRASTRUCTURE. LIKE AND WHICH IS AN ALLEN OF OUR PLAN WE THINK. THE WAY BE IT WILL BE ON WHY I MEAN IF. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THIS IS THIS REALLY LINE ALL AND BUILD AROUND THEIR BANK ARE CREE DIVIDE. THAT MANY OF US TRAVEL ALL OVER THE TO GO YOU KNOW PLACES CREE THAT VIBRANCE AROUND WE CAN DO THAT REAL SMARTLY AND STILL OFFER. AFFORDABLE AND WORKFORCE HOUSING VERY CLOSE TO WHERE PEOPLE TRANSPORT AND THAT ALLOWS THEM TO REALLY BEGIN TO CUT DOWN ON THE COMMUTE DISTANCES. FARTHER OUT THERE BECAUSE IF WE IF WE HAVE TO ADD A MORE JOBS AND MORE- MORE PEOPLE WE NEED TO THEN BUILD EVEN MORE CLOSER TO THOSE JOBS AND PEOPLE. WE ARE TODAY LOSING TALENT. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PORTABLE HOUSING OUR YOUNG FOLKS WE HAVE I THINK WE CAN ABOUT TWENTY FIVE. FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES IN OUR REGION. THEY GRAB WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THOUSANDS OF YOUNG TALENT EVERY MAY JUNE. MOST OF THEM LEAVE THE REGION. THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR US AND I THINK IT'S REALLY AND- ISSUE FOR US WE DON'T ABOUT. WE CREATE MORE HOUSING AND TO CREATE MORE HOUSING WE HAVE TO. BE A LITTLE MORE INTENSIFIED. BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE AND I THINK IT'S ALSO A- FOR US BECAUSE WE'RE- TO HAVE THIS THESE PAY. CONVERSE IN LIFE US BUT ALL. OF THOSE WHO ARE IN A TWO AND WHO LIE STREAMING TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT ALL OF THE SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS REPRESENT. SOME OF THEM WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND FROM A LEGISLATIVE. PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK THIS IT UNDER HIGHLIGHTED A COUPLE OF BILLS THAT ARE ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION- HAVE BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION. BUT ALSO THROUGH THE BUDGET SUPPORTING THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET- TOOLS QUITE FRANKLY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HANDS TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY. BUILD BUT THERE IS A ROAD AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO- FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO BRIDGE THE GAP IN TERMS OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. TRYING TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN QUALITY LIFE FOR THE SAME TOP RECOGNIZE. THAT. AS WE START TO EXPAND ON REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS AND THEY- INTERSECT THERE CAN. IS WILL CA OP. FOR HOUSING TO BE BUILT- THAT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESSIBILITY- TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION RAIL TRANSPORTATION BUT OTHER FORMS- WE WERE WE WERE SAYING HIGHLIGHTED. SO IT IS A CONVERSATION OF CONNECTING THE DOTS AND I DO APPRECIATE. THE FOCUS OF THIS PANELS- PRESENTATION- WE THANK YOU FOR THAT- IF YOU CAN STICK AROUND WE LOVE TO HAVE YOU AND IF I ANY. COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC TIE INTO YOUR ISSUE THAT- YOU'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RESPOND AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THIS MORNING. THE THIRD CONCLUDING. OF OUR ATTENTION ON SPECIFICALLY ON ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. IT WILL LOOK AT THE VALUE OF PROGRAMS CONNECTING STUDENTS TO SCHOOLS AND HOW QUALITY TRANSIT CAN PROMOTE EQUITY AND ACCESS FOR FINANCIALLY BURDENED WRITERS. MARIANA HER AT- JONES FROM A C. T. L. A. OR ACT LA WILL TOUCH UPON THE IMPORTANCE OF QUALITY BUS TRANSIT OPTIONS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AS DIRECTOR POLICY IN COMMUNICATION AT MOVE LA GLORIA OLEN WILL DISCUSS HOW MAKING TRANSIT MORE AFFORDABLE PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES AND REAL THAT RELY. AND RELEASE FINING PRESSURES. FROM STUDENT RAW CHIEF OFFICER FOR OMNI TRANS AND- MICHAEL TURNER DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR GOVERNOR RELATIONS AT LA METRO WILL TOUCH UPON THEIR CURRENT STUDENT TRANSIT PASS PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE OF CLEANER BUS TECHNOLOGY. SO WELCOME ALL OF YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION. A MARIANNA WOULD GO FIRST I REALLY. NOTHING NUMBER THE LOOKING THINK CAN MY THAT. THANK YOU ARE YOU AGAIN FOR AND US TO PART OF THE HEARING SO I MIGHT AND I WITH THE AT THE FOR CAN TRY. ON AND I'LL BE MY REMARK ON JUST. WHAT WE SEE AS SOME OF THE- OF I. TO QUALITY TRYING FOR COMMUNITY. I READ AND COUNTY REGION FOCUS ME IN OUR CITY AND I LIKE HOW AND AT SOME SOLUTION THAT WE'VE ALREADY IDENTIFIED IN OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE- PRESENT. SO THE ALLIANCE FOR COMMUNITY TRANSIT IS. HOLD OF SEVEN GROUPS WORKING AROUND THE ISSUES OF TRANSIT AND HOUSING SO IT INCLUDES TENANT RIGHTS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT GROUPS- AND TRANSIT EQUITY ORGANIZATIONS. AND WE WANTED TO COME TOGETHER TO LOOK AT POLICY SOLUTIONS- AND CAMPAIGNS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT. AND ENSURE THAT WE CAN CREATE THE BEST QUALITY AND EFFICIENT- TRANSIT SYSTEM- POSSIBLE FOR THE FOR THOSE WHO NEEDED- WE CAME TOGETHER AFTER THE PASSAGE OF MEN MEASURE ARE. IN TWENTY ELEVEN TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC TRANSIT ARE REALLY OP BENEFITING AND UPLIFTING- TRANSIT RIDERS AND THE RESIDENTS LIVING YOUR TRANSIT AND NOT DISPLACING THEM. SO KNOW ALLEY HAS A MAJOR TRAFFIC- AND CONGESTION TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND HOUSING PROBLEM AND THEY ARE LINKED FOR DECADES WE HAVE FOCUSED ON AND FAVORITE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING SUBURBAN SPRAWL AND KERR CENTRIC- DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS ON A AND ALSO THE LACK OF. INVESTMENTS IN TRANSIT HAVE REALLY CREATED A SYSTEM THAT IS UNDER RESOURCE WERE ROOM WE OVER RELY ON CARS AND MOST REST MOST PEOPLE ARE DRIVING TO WORK ALONE. THIS HAS IMPACTS ON ALL OF US BUT WE- WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS REALLY HAS DISPROPORTION IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND ALL INCOME RESIDENTS. IN ADDITION TO REALLY IMPACTING OUR POCKETBOOKS AND OUR CLIMATE. AND SOMEONE. SO IN IN TWENTY. WE PASSED MEASURE M. AND THAT'S CREATING THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT. IN THE IN THE U. S. CURRENTLY SO IT'S OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS BEING INVESTED- ON GOING FOR- TRANSIT BUT ALSO ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION MODES AND IT IS YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO REALLY TRANSFORM THE REGION ON THROUGHOUT THE NEXT. SEVERAL DECADES AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT ITS FOCUS A LOT ON RAIL WHICH IS WONDERFUL AND WE NEED MORE CONNECTIVITY IN THE IN THE REGION BUT 70% OF METRO USERS ACTUALLY RIDE THE BUS. I AND YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT INVESTING AS MUCH IN OUR BUS SYSTEM CURRENTLY AND OVER THE LAST SEVERAL A OVER THE LAST DECADE IN FACT METRO HASN'T LOST WRITERS UP 225% OF WRITERS HAVE STOPPED USING BUSES ALTOGETHER THERE MANY FACTORS INCLUDING- YOU KNOW ACCESS TO DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR BOOKS I DIDN'T HAVE IT BEFORE. YOU'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE NEAR BUS BUS LINES ARE OR- YOU KNOW THOSE TRANSIT RICH COMMUNITIES BUT IT'S ALSO THE LACK OF A VERY HIGH QUALITY AND RELIABLE AND DEPENDABLE SYSTEM THAT WILL REALLY GET PEOPLE TO THEIR DESTINATION ON TIME AND YOU KNOW WHERE WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO A SHELTER SO THAT. YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE OUR THAT OUR HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS CAN ACTUALLY USE OUR BUS SYSTEM SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE ARE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THEM. REVIVING OUR BUS AND IMPROVING OUR BUSES. SO YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT IN MANY IN THE MEASURE REGION OF USERS OF OUR TRANSIT. THEY ARE MATURE PEOPLE OVER SIX FOR. AND THE LOW INCOME SEVEN OVERSEE FOR OF. US MET RIDERS LAW BURNED LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND A YEAR WITH THE MEAT INCOME FOR BUST OF. A LITTLE OVER THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND FOR RAIL RYE IT'S ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND A SO A VERY LOW INCOME POPULATION VERY OF OWNER POP AND IT'S ALSO A VERY. UP A POPULATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO TWO VEHICLES- WE HAVE SEEN THAT ABOUT 10% OF. BLACK HOUSEHOLDS IN THE ALLEY COUNTY AREA DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A CAR IN ABOUT ELEVEN PERCENT. OF LATINO. HOUSEHOLDS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A CAR SO THESE ARE TRANSIT DEPENDENT ON. RESIDENTS THAT REALLY NEED ACCESS TO A GOOD QUALITY TRANSIT SYSTEM. AND I MENTIONED THAT OVER 70% OF US WRITERS. ARE AT 70% A MEASURE USERS ARE USING THE BUS SYSTEM BUT WE ARE LOSING. THE OF BASS MAJORITY OF BUS RIDERS AND THIS IS THE LARGEST DECLINE NATIONALLY IT'S- A PERCENT THAT METRO HAS LOST OVER THE LAST DECADE. I'M ONE OF THE- POINTS AN INMATE ABOUT KNOW IT'S BEEN MEN BEFORE FROM OTHER PANELISTS THAT WE HAVE VERY- BIG GOALS FOR MEETING CARBON REDUCTION CARBON EMISSION REDUCTIONS- AND YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REACH THOSE GOALS BUT- UNLESS WE ARE. TAKING THE BUS RIDERSHIP LOS VERY SERIOUSLY WE CANNOT ACTUALLY MEET SOME OF OUR GOAL SO. IN THIS SLIDE IT SHOWS THAT- THIS GAG REGION MAKES UP OVER 50% OF TRANSIT- TRIPS THE SHARE OF TRANSIT TO TRIP SO WE NEED TO REALLY RECOVER. THE 25% IF NOT MORE OF TRYING A BUS RIDERS TO ACTUALLY. OF ATTEMPT TO MEET SOME OF OUR CLIMATE GOALS- AND OF CARBON EMISSION REDUCTIONS. SO I THE AS A COLD A OR- IS REAL YOU KNOW FACED WITH- THE PRESS ORGANIZATIONS AND- TRANSIT RIDERS WHO USE THE SYSTEM EVERY DAY WE'VE IDENTIFIED SOME SOLUTIONS- AND METRO IS ACTUALLY A LEADER IN REALLY IDENTIFYING SOLUTIONS AND- IMPLEMENTING THEM SO. WE HAVE A YOU KNOW A LEADER IN THE REGION BUT WE DO WANT TO SEE THE AGENCY DO MORE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF FALLING RIDERSHIP AND REALLY AND IMPROVE OUR SYSTEM FOR EVERYONE- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN METRO PASS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND. TRANSIT ORIENTED TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITIES POLICY- WHICH RELATES TO THE PANEL THAT SPOKE PREVIOUSLY BUT IT REALLY IS- LOOKING AT ADDRESSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND DISPLACEMENT ALONG THE TRANSIT CORRIDORS- AND THIS IS KEY TO REALLY BE ABLE TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ARE ABLE TO KEEP RESIDENTS THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON TRANSIT TO STAY IN THOSE TRANSIT RICH NEIGHBORHOODS- YOU KNOW THIS IS A GREAT POLICY BUT WE- DON'T HAVE. FUNDING ALLOCATED FOR THIS POLICY SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT HAS TEETH AND THAT MORE FUNDING IS ON CREATED FOR THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE SEEN YOU PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE- INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN. DO TRANSIT NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING OUR COMMUNITY AND LAND PLANNING TO COMMENT EIGHT YOU BETTER PROTECTIONS FOR LOW INCOME RENTERS AND THAT WRITERS IN THESE JURISDICTIONS- ANOTHER'S NEED A SOLUTION. IS YOU KNOW THE ISSUE OF. I RELY THIRTY AND IMPROVE TO THE BUS SYSTEM. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS YOU KNOW MATCH IS CREATE A IMPROVING THE BUS SYSTEM WE- ARE TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT. IN A BAY. THEY ARE IN KNOW BUSTED A LAY. I YOU KNOW IMP THE THAT AREAS THAT WE HAVE SHELTER THERE'S BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE NEAR- BUS STOPS AND AREAS WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACCESS THE BUS SYSTEM. AND THAT THEY RUN ON WEEKENDS AND EVENINGS AND YOU KNOW BETTER SERVICE SO THAT IT'S MORE RELIABLE AND OUR- COME FASTER. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO SEE AS WELL- WE ALSO YOU KNOW METRO IS RECENTLY FOR THE TAKING THE LEADERSHIP OF ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF EQUITY. AND LOOKING HOW WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE DEFINING EQUITY FOR THE FUNDING THAT THE ALLOCATING GOING FORWARD- AND THE WAY THAT THEY DEFINED IT IS NEAT I'M- THEY'RE CALLING THEM EQUITY FOR. CAN BE SO. OUR SENSES TRACTS WITH LOW CAR. WE'RE COME THAT HAVE. THAT HAVE LOW CAR. HOUSEHOLD WITH NO CARS THESE HOUSES WITH NO CAR AND LOW IN CAN. SO PRIORITIZING FUN. IN THE AREAS I HAVE HAD DECENT FOR MANY DECADES AND ENSURING THAT AREAS THAT YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CAR ACTUALLY HAVE BETTER AND- QUALITY TRANSIT ACCESS. SO ENSURING THAT YOU KNOW ANY TRANSIT PLANNING AND- FUNDING IT REALLY IS PRIORITIZING THESE EQUITY FOCUS COMMUNITIES. AS A WAY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- WITH THIS MAJOR BILLION DOLLAR HUNDRED YOU KNOW SIXTY BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THAT THERE ARE. MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING SO THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE REALLY INVOLVED TRANSIT RIDERS ARE INVOLVED IN HOW THESE FUNDING HOW THESE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED TO REALLY ENHANCE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND FEEL- JUST REALLY CONNECTED AND WANT TO REALLY USE THE SYSTEM- VERSES YOU KNOW PUTTING DOWN. THERE DOLLARS INTO AREAS THAT ARE NOT REALLY IMPROVING THE TRANSIT SYSTEM ARE ENHANCING EXPERIENCE THE EXPERIENCE OF TRANSIT RIDERS- AND- THERE ARE A LOT OF A- AS I MENTIONED. AHMED IS REESE THEIR BUS SYSTEMS THEY THEY INITIATED SURVEYS AND ARE STUDYING HOW THEY CAN YOU KNOW RE RE COOPER GET BACK THERE TRANSIT THE BUS WRITERS THAT THEY'VE LOST- AND YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF A NETWORK OF BUSES WILL WORK FOR OUR REGION- SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE IS- GOOD PLANS GOING FORWARD METRO RECENTLY- ADOPTED WHAT THEY'RE CALLING A TRANSIT FIRST MODEL- WHICH WILL HELP- RECOVER- SOME OF THE TRANSIT RIDERS AT THE HAVE BEEN LOST BUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE FUNDING ALLOCATED THERE WAS ANOTHER MODEL CALLED THE FUTURE FUNDING MODEL THAT THE- WE'RE CONSIDERING BUT DECIDED NOT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SO WE WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THERE IS A LOT MORE FUNDING ALLOCATED TO THE BUS- REDESIGN A BUS RESTRUCTURING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY OF RECOVERING LOST ON BUS WRITERS AND INSURING THAT WE ARE CREATING THE BEST AND MOST EFFICIENT BUS SYSTEM- FOR THE REGION AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN A CONVERSATION ABOUT CONGESTION PRICING OR CONGESTION RELIEF MODELS METROS ALSO CURRENTLY STUDYING THIS. AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT- HOW TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO REALLY- AND CONGESTION PRICING JUST TO REALLY ANA SHORT WAY IS THAT IT WOULD CREATE- KIND OF LIKE- IT WOULD PRICE. ROLE THAT ARE IN THE DURING PEAK I. SO THAT IF YOU'RE A DRY YOU WOULD HAVE PAY YOU THE ROAD KINDA LIKE TOLL ROAD WRITER FAST BUT THIS IS A WAY TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF YOU KNOW I DON'T THEIR CARS USING THE PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM BUT WHATEVER REVENUE GENERATED FISCAL BACK. INTO OUR TRANSIT SYSTEM BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S- WE'RE LOOKING AT IT THROUGH AN EQUITY LANDS ENSURING THAT WE CAN. GET EXEMPTION FOR LOW INCOME DRIVERS RIGHT BECAUSE THIS WILL HAVE IMPACT ON A LOT OF DRIVERS AND REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THOSE REVENUE REVENUE GENERATED. IS GOING BACK TO THE BUS SYSTEM AND TO COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DISINVEST IT FOR MANY YEARS AND FINALLY. ANOTHER BUT YOU NEED IS A NATIONAL DISCUSSION FAIR FOR TRANSIT. IT SOUNDS IN A WHILE BUT WE WANT YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SEE THAT IN OUR LIFETIME. THAT OUR SYSTEM ARE TO TRANSIT SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY UNIVERSAL PUBLIC GOOD AND THAT IT'S FAIR FREE FOR ALL OF US. WHO ARE YOU KNOW. NOT INVESTING OUR TAX DOLLARS INTO THIS. AND YOU KNOW WE ALREADY SEEN THIS IN THE CITY OF OLYMPIA WASHINGTON. IN KANSAS CITY MISSOURI THEY JUST CREATED THERE. BUT THERE RAIL SYSTEM AND BUS SYSTEMS FARE FREE. HI N. ON MONTGOMERY. THERE IS OF. A SIMILAR PROGRAM. FOR YOUTH SO THEY MAKE TRANSIT PASSES FREE FOR YOU THEN THEY'VE SEEN A 50% INCREASE IN RIDERSHIP. SINCE IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM SO THERE'S A DEMAND THERE IS AN EXCITEMENT ABOUT HAVING ACCESS TO TRANSIT AND WE KNOW THAT MORE PEOPLE. WILL USE IT IF IT'S FREE FOR THEM- FOR YOU KNOW FOR EITHER SHORT TERM OR FOR LONG TERM. SO YOU KNOW JUST THESE ARE SOME REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITIES AND- IT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND THE DIALOGUE GOING FORWARD SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. HER NEXT WORDS. I'M NAME IS OAKLAND AND WORK FOR AN OR AND NO CALLED LA WE WORK MOSTLY ON TRANSPORTATION BUT ALSO ON HOUSING AND CLIMATE CHANGE WE WORKED WITH CLOSELY WITH METRO ON MEASURES ARE AND THEN AND WE LIKE TO FIND WAY FIND SOURCES OF MONEY TO HELP GOVERNMENT DO GOOD THINGS AND I'M VERY HONORED TO BE ASKED TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY THAT STUDENT TRANSIT PASSES BECAUSE WE WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN. AND STUDENT TRANSIT PASSES FOR THE NUMBER ONE YEARS. SO ON I THINK AS- WITH THE FIRST. OKAY ON A GUESS THAT IS IT ON. I REALLY THINK THE IF WOULD ABOUT CA CAL IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT CONNECTING STUDENTS TO OPPORTUNITY AND I'D JUST I THINK WE HAVE HE KNOWS THE MOST AWESOME ROAD SYSTEM IN THE WORLD BUT IT'S TIME TO START ADDING OTHER ELEMENTS LIKE TRANSIT AND BIKING AND WALKING AND BIKE SELECTED BIKES AND SCOOTERS IN YES. SKATEBOARDS FOR REBEL AND- I THINK THAT BUT. IT'S THAT SUDDENLY ALL OF THE- PEOPLE. WE NEED. FIVE THE PRESENTATION. SO AND LIGHTEN MARIANI'S. SUDDENLY THERE ALWAYS INTEREST IN TRADE PASS AND I'VE WHEN I WAS THE THINK ABOUT THIS POINT I STARTED ON LAW A WEEK AGO LOAN BUT I FOR ALL THESE TO AND JUST THE LAST WEEKS WHERE CITIES OF THE ARE TALK ABOUT MAKING TRANSIT FREE WHICH WHILE. AND I CAN IT WORK I DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE- CITIES EVERYWHERE FACING THE SAME PROBLEMS WHICH ARE IN AS TRAFFIC AND IT'S POVERTY AND ITS- DECLINING RIDERSHIP AND IT'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE. SO ON WE ARE- WHY STUDENT TRANSIT PASSES. YOU KNOW WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT COLLEGE IS HARD AND THAT IT SEEMS TO BE OR CALL IT CAN BE HARD AND IT SEEMS TO BE GETTING HARDER IN WE REALLY NEED AN EDUCATED WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA TO REMAIN ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE BUT IT'S INTERESTING STUDENTS ARE POOR AND A STUDY BY ACCOUNT BY CSU IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FOUND THAT AN ESTIMATED 10% OF CSU STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS AND ALMOST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OUR FOOD IN SECURE. AND YEAR THERE WAS A STUDY OF FORTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT FOUND THAT HAVE STRUGGLED TO BUY FOOD. A MAJORITY HAVE A- OF THE STUDENTS HAVE TROUBLE PAYING THE RENT AND 20% ARE HOMELESS AND. WHEN STUDENTS IN THE FACE OF SCHOOLS LIKE THESE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO VERY WELL AT SCHOOL AND- IT WAS INTERESTING LAST WEEK AT METRO THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT. EVERY STUDENT TRANSIT PASSES FOR LA U. S. T. COLLEGE STUDENTS. LA U. S. D. IS STUDENTS KIDS WOULD TUNES IN LOS ANGELES AND- IT WAS SHOT TO ME. FIND OUT THE AND I JUST OBVIOUSLY PAYING FOR TRANSPORTATION THEN BECOMES A VERY BIG DEAL FOR THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND A LOT OF THE STUDENTS. THEN EVADE PAYING FARE IS AND THEY GET CAUGHT BY THE POLICE AND THEN THEY GET TRAPPED UP IN THE- IN THE YOU KNOW. CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT'S A BIT HARSH BUT THEY GET YOU KNOW IT LEADS THEM IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. SO AND THERE'S ALSO A VERY FAMOUS STUDY THAT WAS DONE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BY HARBOR THAT TALKS THAT FOUND THAT ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST FACTOR. IN THE ODDS OF THIS GAPING POVERTY AND AVOIDING HOMELESSNESS SO CLEARLY ON. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GIVE STUDENTS ACCESS. TO TRANSPORTATION. END NEXT BUT SO IT'S NOT JUST STUDENTS THE BENEFIT IT'S ALSO THE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE- THIS REDUCES DRIVE LOAN MODE SHARE IT REDUCES THE NEED FOR SCHOOL TO BUILD PARKING STRUCTURES WHEN THAT LAND IS EXPENSIVE IT CAN BE USED FOR. THE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH EDUCATION INSTEAD REDUCES. PARKING DEMAND- COSTS CAN BE SHARED THERE WAS UCLA STUDY THAT FOUND- STUDENTS ARE WILLING TO HELP PAY FOR THESE PASSES ON. AND IT WAS INTERESTING LAST YEAR EIGHT OF NINE ON. LA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT SCHOOLS VOTED TO ADD THIRTEEN DOLLARS THE STUDENTS VOTED TO CHARGE THEMSELVES AN EXTRA THIRTEEN DOLLARS PER SEMESTER TO HELP PAY FOR DISCOUNT PASSES FOR MET METRO. AND IT'S ALSO INTERESTING NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF ABSENTEE ISN'T K. THROUGH TWELVE IS LACK OF TRANSPORTATION AND THAT OBVIOUSLY DRAMATICALLY REDUCES THE FUNDING PER STUDENT RECEIVED BY SCHOOLS. IN. SO THERE'S A CONUNDRUM YOU KNOW METRO HAS A PROBLEM DESPITE RAIL BUILDING BOOM AND ALL OF THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE'RE SPENDING ON BUILDING A BIGGER RAIL SYSTEM THERE IS STILL RIDERSHIP IS DECLINING AND ON THE OTHER HAND- THE LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE HAS A POVERTY PROBLEM SO YOU KNOW WITH 80% OF THE STUDENTS. LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LINE SO WHAT IF METRO AND LA U. S. D. HELD ONE AT. AND IN FACT THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING THERE WAS A BIG THE BOARD MEETING LAST WEEK THERE WAS A BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER ON METRO COULD PROVIDE FREE. TRANSIT PASSES TO K. THROUGH TWELVE OR K. THROUGH I THINK TO ALL STUDENTS ACTUALLY AND- SO THEY'RE WORKING ON IT AND- INDEX BUT BUT I SHOULD ALSO GOING FOR I'M SORRY YOU KNOW. EIGHT STUDENTS COULD FILL IN SEATS. DURING OFF PEAK HOUR IN THAT COULD HELP NOT ONLY INCREASE TOTAL TRANSIT RIDERSHIP BUT IT COULD HELP REDUCE OPERATING SUBSIDIES IT COULD CAUSE HIGHER DEMAND FOR TRANSIT WHICH ALSO TENDS TO RESULT IN BETTER SERVICE. IT COULD YOU IMPROVE DECLINING RIDERSHIP IT COULD PRODUCE TRAFFIC SO. THE PUBLIC THE GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD ALSO BENEFIT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY AGAIN DRESSES ALL THE BIG PROBLEMS TRAFFIC BY TAKING CARS OFF THE ROAD REDUCE PARKING DEMAND REDUCES AIR POLLUTION. AND AGAIN WE NEED EDUCATED WORKFORCE THIS PICTURE HOWEVER DOES NOT REALLY DEPICT THE PROBLEM BECAUSE- THE FOR A FIVE THREE THIS IS A GOOD DAY ON THE FOUR OH FIVE AS ALL THESE CARS MANY OF THEM PEOPLE WHO ARE HEADING TO UCLA TO GO TO SCHOOL. ON IN ITS SCHOOLS ESPECIALLY BIG ONES LIKE UCLA OR YOU SEE SUN OR IS STILL A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE LOTS LOTS OF. WHICH IS OF COURSE THE BIGGEST OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SO THERE IS THAT WE GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO WITH. AND WE'RE VERY HARD WITH MEMBER. IS THE X. DIRECTOR OF MOVE LA WORK WITH CENTER BECAUSE- ON BILL THE UNC. THIS ALSO STUDENT PASS PROGRAM WHICH THE CALL AND BLUE BUT- AND BEEN HOT EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE HALF OF ALL STUDENTS FACULTY FACULTY AND STAFF NOW USE TRANSIT TO GET TO CAMPUS. AND ON. THE WAY THIS IS DONE IS THE SCHOOL PAYS PART. AND THE BIG BLUE BUS DISCOUNTS THE TRANSIT PASSES AND STUDENTS ALSO PAY A PART THEY THEY PAY NINE DOLLARS PER SEMESTER WHICH IS NOT VERY MUCH MONEY AND THEY CAN RIDE ANY LINE ANY TIME FOR FREE. WHAT'S NOT FOR FREE THEY PAID NINE DOLLARS BUT ON THIS IS THE WAY IT'S DONE IS WHEN STUDENTS REGISTER FOR CLASSES THEY CAN THEY DON'T OPT IN THEY CAN OPT OUT BUT THEY DON'T OFTEN. SAID THE END IS THAT IT IT OPERATES KIND OF LIKE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM WE BY HEALTH INSURANCE EVERYBODY PAYS PAYS A LITTLE BUT NOBODY HAS TO PAY THAT MUCH AND EVERYBODY BENEFITS SO THIS IS WHAT IS BEING CALLED THE HEALTH INSURANCE MODEL. AND INTERESTINGLY ON THE LEGISLATURE ASKED UC IRVINE TO DO A STUDY THAT STUDENT TRANSIT PASSES BECAUSE WE HAD. WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN GOTTEN A STUDENT TRANSIT PASS ON GOVERNOR BROWN'S DESK. BUT HE SAID HE VETOED IT AND HE SAID HE NEEDED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW STUDENT TRANSIT PASS PROGRAMS WORKING CALIFORNIA. SO THIS STUDY WAS DONE. HELP ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND IT WAS JUST DELIVERY TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND IT'S REALLY INTEREST. BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT THE INSURANCE MY AND HOW THIS BE A WAY. BECAUSE I KNOW YOU KNOW FREE IS SUCH A GREAT I BUT FREE IS DIFFERENT. SOMEBODY HAS TO. AND WHO INTO THE LATEST CAN. METRO CAN PAY. THE SCHOOLS PAY THIS CAN PAY BUT- HAVING A BE FREE FOR EVERYBODY I DO KNOW WHO THEN PAYS. BUT IT'S A GREAT IDEA AND I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP IT. KEEP IT UNDER CONSIDERATION. SO ON AGAIN IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT FAMILY MEMBER GONZALEZ HAS AB THIRTEEN FIFTY BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT BILL- FLEW AT OF ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION IT FLEW OUT OF HER APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND IT GOT OUT THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR SO. YOU KNOW THERE'S ALREADY MOMENTUM IN THAT AREA A MAYOR GARCETTI HAS MADE THE DASH BUS IN LOS ANGELES SPREE FOR ALL K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS. THE CITY IS PAYING FOR THAT PROGRAM SAYS AGAIN SOMEBODY IS PAYING EVEN THOUGH IT'S FREE. AND METRO IS NOW STUDYING HOW TO MAKE TRANSIT FREE FOR ALL STUDENTS I THINK IT'S GONNA BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE. HOW THAT GOES. I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT SACK OR TA IS ALSO MAKING STUDENTS FREE MAKING PASSES FREE FOR STUDENTS. OF THE- A WAY. IN METRO SEE PHIL WANTS TO CAN CHEN HAS TO PAY FOR IT TRANSIT AND MAKE IT FREE FOR P. WHICH- WHILE THAT'LL BE THAT'LL BE THE DAY. I MEAN I WON IT TO BE THE DAY SO I AND THEN NOW IN WOMEN. HELLO HAS IN THE BILL WHICH- YOU HAVE AN ENTRY YET BUT YOU WILL. END SO NEXT. SO WE HAVE WORKED WITH MEMBER HOLDEN STUDENT SINCE TWENTY. LOW THIS PICTURE HE IS THE CHAIR. OF IN THAT THE TWO BILLS WE WORK ON TOGETHER THE BILLS ACTUALLY HAD ALMOST YOU SUPPORT IN MAY COMMITTEES AND IT WAS BROAD SUPPORT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IT WAS NOT IT'S NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE ANYWAY AND THEN YOU KNOW WE GOT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND HE SAID NO. BUT NOW THAT THE STUDIES BEEN DELIVERED WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE PROGRESS THIS YEAR'S SO IT'S ALL VERY EXCITING AND I THINK THAT'S THE AGAIN. YOU KNOW HOW HELLO BUT- IF THIRTEEN FIFTY IF YOUR BILL GETS ACROSS HOW WILL IT BE FUNDED YOU KNOW THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IS ONE POSSIBILITY IT THE STATE BUDGET IS ONE POSSIBILITY YOU KNOW THIS HEALTH INSURANCE FUNDING MODEL WHERE EVERYBODY PUTS IN A LITTLE MONEY. IT'S ANOTHER GREAT MODEL METRO HAS BEEN WORKING TRYING TO WORK TOWARD THAT KIND OF THE MODEL AND WE ESTIMATE BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE IN SANTA MONICA IT COULD COST ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION A YEAR TO PROVIDE A SUBSIDY FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER STUDENT PER YEAR. SO THAT ALL STUDENTS COULD. GET DISCOUNTED PASS ASSUMING THAT ONLY SEVENTY WOULD PROTECT. LAST FRIDAY. WHO KNEW WE HAD SUPPORT FROM METRO EARLY ON BEGINNING IN TWENTY. AND METRO IS ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED METROS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK. THE LEGISLATURE IS TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK SO TWENTY TWENTY I THINK IT'S THE YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- A WE SHOULD CHORE YOURS STEP. A SUPPORT IN AND ENERGY THIS INITIATIVE AND CERTAINLY- TAKE MORE THAN ANY TAKES ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND I'M OPTIMISTIC THIS TIME AROUND AS WELL- FOR TWO REMAINING PRISONERS IF I COULD JUST ASK YOU TO SORT OF CONVINCE YOUR PRESENTATION WE HAVE TO BE OUT BY ONE I DO WANT TO GIVE THOSE WHO. HAVE SOME QUESTIONS TO TASK AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE CERTAINLY GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AARON RODGERS AND I'M THE INTERIM CEO AND GENERAL MANAGER OF ON THE TRANS YOUR LOCAL TRANSIT SYSTEM HERE IN THE SAN BERNARDINO VALLEY IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION ON BEHALF OF OMNI TRANS AND ON BEHALF OF THE REGION. OTHERS BEEN A WEALTH OF THE L. WEALTH OF INFORMATION SHARED AND I HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A LOT OF MY THUNDER BEING SOLD BY SOME OF MY PREVIOUS PANELISTS SO IT WILL HELP ME SHORTEN MY PRESENTATION- I THINK WE ALL AGREE- WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT RAIL WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ALL OF THESE. ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT A ROBUST AND STRONG TRANSIT SYSTEM REALLY HAS TO BE THE BACKBONE THAT'S IN PLACE AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO MEET OUR OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS GOALS. JUST QUICKLY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ON THE TRANS- WE ARE THE LARGEST TRANSPORTATION TRANSPORTATION- PROVIDER IN THE SAN BERNADINO VALLEY- OUR TAGLINE IS CONNECTING OUR COMMUNITY- WE SERVE FIFTEEN CITIES IN THE COUNTY OF SAN BRING A DINO AND OUR SERVICE AREA STRETCHES TO THE WEST ALL THE WAY TO THE LA COUNTY LINE STARTING ALL THE WAY OVER CHINO HILLS CHINO. AND WE WE'D SOUTH TO THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY LINE AND WE SPREAD ALL THE WAY OVER- THROUGH THE VALLEY- SAMBAR TO SALMON A DINO YUCAIPA HIGHLAND GRAND TERRACE- CONNECTING OUR COMMUNITY WHERE THE OWNER OF A REGIONAL- OUR AGENCY OWNS A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION CENTER IN THE CITY A SAMPOERNA DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE CONNECT WITH THE RIVERSIDE TRANSIT AUTHORITY THE VICTOR VALLEY TRANSIT AUTHORITY THE MOUNTAIN AREA TRANSIT ALREADY PASSED TRANSIT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF CONNECTING WITH SUNLINE TRANSIT IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY. SO WE REALLY ARE- THE MULTI MODAL CENTER WITH THE METROLINK TRAINS IN THERE AS WELL AS THE FUTURE ERRO RAIL SERVICES YOU HEARD ABOUT EARLIER AS YOU KNOW WE'RE FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING- AND I'LL JUST TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS WHICH REALLY SORT OF- REFLECTS THE INFORMATION THE MARIANA SHARED WITH YOU- WE KNOW THAT 30% OF OUR RIDERS ARE BETWEEN. ARE ARE GENERALLY STUDENTS BETWEEN THE AGE OF NINETEEN AND TWENTY NINE ANOTHER 30% ARE BETWEEN FIFTY AND SIXTY FIVE AND THEY'RE GENERALLY LOW INCOME IN TERMS OF THOSE STATISTICS FOR OUR RIDERS- THE AVERAGE INCOME. IS A 57% OF OUR WRITERS HAVE AN AVERAGE INCOME OF UNDER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND 80% UNDER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THE THIS IS THE DEMOGRAPHIC- THAT THAT WERE GENERALLY SERVING- IN TERMS OF OUR TRIP PURPOSE- TO THE POINTS THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER APPROXIMATELY OUR SYSTEM. ARE TAKING PEOPLE TO WORK IN TO SCHOOL- SO WE ARE THAT VITAL LINK CONNECTING THESE COMMUNITIES TO OPPORTUNITY EDUCATION AND JOBS. AND AS AND AS YOU KNOW OUR SERVICE AREA SPAN AS WE SPAN ACROSS THE VALLEY REALLY DOES COVER A NUMBER OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. AND WHILE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY AS AS A WHOLE ACROSS NOT JUST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THE COUNTRY EXPERIENCING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN RIDERSHIP WE TO MERE A MERE WHAT WE SHARED ABOUT METRO WE'VE EXPERIENCED ABOUT A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. DROP IN RIDERSHIP AND- DESPITE THIS WE KNOW- THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A VITAL LINK IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING TO ADDRESS THAT IN THE FUTURE BUT FIRST I WANT TO TOUCH ON- WE'VE ALSO HEARD A LOT ABOUT. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS CONGESTION AIR QUALITY SO I DO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT- ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND THE PARTNERSHIP. THAT WE BRING TO THIS TO THIS COMMUNITY- I'M THE TRANS LEAD THAT THE INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EARLY IN THE TWO THOUSANDS BY INTRODUCING THE VERY FIRST HYBRID ELECTRIC TRANSIT BUS. AND AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PAST DECADE WE TRANSITIONED OUR ENTIRE FLEET TO COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS ENGINES- WHICH ARE THE CLEANEST BURNING- ENGINES THAT WERE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW WE'RE RE POWERING- SIXTY FIVE OF OUR BUSES TO WHAT'S CALLED A NEAR ZERO. AND GIN- WHICH WILL REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS EVEN MORE UP 290% WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH THAT PROJECT 70% OF OUR FLEET WILL. WILL BE OPERATING WITH THE CLEANEST BURNING ENGINES AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET. SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT. AND AS WE COMPLETE THAT AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE PREPARING TO MEET THE STATE MANDATED INNOVATIVE CLEAN TRANSIT RULE WHICH AS YOU KNOW REQUIRES TRANSIT OPERATORS TO TRANSITION THEIR FLEETS TWO ZERO MISSION BY TWENTY FORTY. THAT THE GRAPH ON THIS SLIDE BEFORE YOU. DEPICTS OUR FLEET ROLL OUT PLAN IS TO COMPLY WITH THIS REGULATION AND WE ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THIS PLAN TO CARB BY JUNE OF THIS YEAR. THE BLUE BARS ON THIS GRAPH SO ARE COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS BUSES AND YOU CAN SEE THEY GET TRANSITIONED OUT EACH YEAR AS WE BRING IN ZERO EMISSION BUSES. WERE EXCITED- TO REPORT THAT WE WILL BE GOING TO OUR BOARD. NEXT MONTH TO SEEK APPROVAL TO PURCHASE THE FIRST FOUR BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSES FOR OUR FLEET AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON TO SUPPORT US IN THE- PREPARING OUR FACILITIES TO MEET THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEMANDS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET THAT MANDATE- I'D ALSO LIKE YOU HEARD ABOUT. ONTARIO'S TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES GRANT COMMUNITIES CLIMATE GRANT- WE WERE ONE OF THE PARTNERS IN THAT EFFORT SO THAT BUS TOUR YOU ONE ON I'M QUITE CERTAIN WAS AN OMNI TRANS BUS AND SO WE'RE EXCITED TO BE A PARTNER. IN THAT PROJECT AND- WE ALSO ARE PARTNERING- WITH SB CTA TO APPLY FOR A GRANT FOR ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLES FOR ANOTHER SIGNIFICANTLY REGION REGIONAL SIGNIFICANT PROJECT THE WEST VALLEY CONNECTOR PROJECT WHICH WILL BRING THE NEXT BUS RAPID TRANSIT. SERVICE TO ONTARIO. I WILL ADD BEFORE I LEAVE THIS SLIDE SINCE SINCE EVERYONE ELSE WAS NOT SHY ENOUGH TO TALK ABOUT EVERYONE'S TECH BOOKS THAT. MEETING THAT THE MANDATE FOR THE ZERO EMISSION BUSES- IS FINANCIALLY A CHALLENGE NOT JUST FROM THE TRANS BUT FOR OTHER SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE TRANSIT AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND WHILE WE BELIEVE IT'S A VERY ACHIEVABLE GOAL WE WILL HAVE TO BE VERY AGGRESSIVE AND WORK- WORK TOGETHER TO FUND TO. FUND THIS THIS IMPORTANT EFFORT. WELL WE TALKED ABOUT TRANSIT EQUITY AND QUICKLY I KNOW I NEED TO ABBREVIATE- AND I AND I SPOKE TO YOU A BIT ABOUT OUR TWO LARGEST DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS THAT ARE USING OUR SYSTEM. STUDENTS AND ALTHOUGH I HESITATE TO CALL FIFTY TO SIXTY FIVE SENIORS I WILL SAY. SENIORS BUT WE DO HAVE A STUDENT PASS PROGRAM CALLED OUR GO SMART PROGRAM- WE PARTNER WITH FOR UNIVERSITIES IN THE REGION AND WE DO JUST WHAT WAS TALKED ABOUT- IS PART OF THE STUDENT FEES WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH THESE CAMPUSES- TO PROVIDE STUDENT STUDENT PASSES SO THOSE AND INCLUDE CHAFEE COLLEGE CRAFTING HILLS COLLEGE THEN BRING TO THE YOU KNOW VALLEY COLLEGE. AND CAL STATE SAN BERNARDINO- AND WITH THAT PROGRAM WERE CONNECTING STUDENTS TO EDUCATION AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING OUR NEXT GENERATION OF TRANSIT RIDERS- BY BY HAVING THAT GROUP FAMILIAR WITH USING THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. NEXT I WILL TOUCH ON. THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN OUR SERVICE AREA- WE'RE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE OUR LOCAL SALES TAX MEASURE SUPPORT SOME OF THESE SERVICES AND THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ADMINISTERED BY OMNI TRANS UNDER THE CONSOLIDATED TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AGENCY AND AS PART OF THE MEASURE WE AT AND AS PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS THE C. TSA- WE HAVE FUNDS TO PROVIDE TO THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT LOCAL COMMUNITY TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND IT AND AS A MATTER OF FACT AS I ARRIVED HERE THIS MORNING. THE BUS THAT WAS OUT FRONT WAS FROM THE WEST END YMCA PROVIDING TRIPS TO SENIORS TO THIS FACILITY RIGHT HERE WHERE WE ARE- USING THAT SERVICE- SO WE'LL WORK WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MANY OF THE CITIES IN YOUR DISTRICTS ARE ARE PARTICIPATING IN THAT PROGRAM THE CITY OF FONTANA REDLANDS GRANT TERRORISTS SO MANY ARE ALREADY PARTICIPATING AND WE'RE REALLY MAKING A PROACTIVE EFFORT. TO GET THAT MONEY OUT IN THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE TO PROVIDE MORE TRIPS UNDER THAT SERVICE. SO QUICKLY THE NEXT SLIDE JUST SHOWS THE REGION THE SERVICE AREA AND I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD TO SEE BUT THE TRIANGLES ARE WHERE THESE PROGRAMS CURRENTLY ARE FUNDED AND AGAIN WE PROACTIVELY REALLY ARE TRYING TO INCREASE THE PARTICIPATION IN THAT PROGRAM. UP NEXT IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABILITY WHAT'S NEXT YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE OUR CONNECT FORWARD PLAN WE ARE REDUCING SERVICE BY 11% AND WE WERE DOING THIS REALLY TO ENSURE A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE FOR OMNI TRANS WERE REALIGNING OUR SERVICES TO MATCH THAT 25% DECLINE IN RIDERSHIP SO WE ALSO BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT'S NECESSARY TO PREPARE US TO BE NIMBLE TO MEET SOME OF THESE OTHER NEEDS THAT THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT- IN THIS PLAN WERE IMPROVING REGIONAL CONNECTIONS TO METROLINK WE ALREADY HAVE CONNECTIONS TO THE AIRPORT THAT WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT- SO WE'RE REALLY WORKING TO MAKE BETTER CONNECTIONS FOR FIRST AND LAST MILE TRIPS. AND INTRODUCED A MORE FLEXIBLE OPTIONS LIKE MICRO TRANSIT WILL BE STARTING OUR FIRST MICRO TRANSIT PILOT PROJECT IN THE CITY OF CHINO HILLS OUT LATER THIS YEAR AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT IS WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS HAVE CHANGED FOR TRANSIT THEY EVERYBODY WANTS EVERYTHING FAST SO WE WILL BE PILOTING THAT CHINO HILLS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT ELECTRIC VEHICLES FOR THAT SERVICE SO WILL BE EXCITED TO SHARE THE NEWS ON HOW THAT GOES. SO LASTLY IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY REALLY OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE THE BUS SYSTEM EASY TO USE WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PLAN PAY AND USE THE SYSTEM WE HAVE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IT WAS ON LAST NIGHT BUT THAT'S OKAY REAL TIME PASSENGER INFORMATION WIFI SYSTEMS ALL THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ALLOW. PEOPLE TO USE OUR SYSTEM. AND CLOSE. I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I KNOW I'M HERE AT THE END I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION- SO WHY TRANSIT I THINK THAT THIS PICTURE WHICH YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN IN OTHER PLACES BEFORE- YOU KNOW REALLY TELLS TELLS THE STORY VISUALLY. AND I KNOW THAT WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE LONG TERM AND SUSTAINABLE OPERATING FUNDING- AND I BELIEVE MUCH OF THE INFORMATION TODAY SUPPORTS REALLY DOES SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT. THAT THE ROBUST TRANSIT SYSTEM REALLY IS THE BACKBONE IN THE STARTING POINT OF EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. SO I WILL BE BRIEF- ACTUALLY QUITE FRANKLY AFTER LISTENING TO- MARIANAS STE- TESTIMONY I JUST TURNED HER AND SAID YES TO EVERYTHING SHE SAID- I COULD NOT HAVE. DONE A BETTER JOB THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE BLOCKING ABOUT OUR CHALLENGE YEAH. SO BUT I JUST TO ADD AND YES EVERY. AARON AND GLOW ALSO IT'S LIKE A MINUTE FOR GOAL MY PRESENT. AND GIVE THREE SAID VERSION OF THE END BUT I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS- INITIATIVES THAT RELATE TO WHAT- EVERYBODY ON THE PANEL WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT METRO- MARIANA MENTION THE NEXT GEN STUDY THAT'S A COMPLETE. RE ENVISIONING OF OUR BUS SYSTEM AND WE ARE ABOUT TO EMBARK. ON A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY MEETINGS- BEGINNING FEBRUARY FIRST. WE'RE WE'RE TAKING PROBABLY THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT A BUS SYSTEM. THAT ANY TRANSIT AGENCY IN THE COUNTRY HAS EVER DONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPLETELY REVAMPING HOW WE OPERATE OUR- OUR BUS SYSTEM. IN LOOKING AT THE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BRINGING UP HERE CONNECTIONS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TELL STUDENTS TRAVEL. I WANT TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT IN THE COURSE OF THAT WE'VE ALSO DONE. THE STUDY THAT I DON'T THINK TO ME TRANSIT AGENCIES DONE THAT HAS TO DO WITH HOW WOMEN TRAVEL. AND IT'S A VERY COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE. YOU KNOW FOR THE BUT A LOT OF FOCUS ON BIKES ON SYSTEM AND PEOPLE ARE THEIR ACCOMMODATIONS FOR BIKES. WITH YOU LOOK CLOSELY WHO RIDE THEIR SYSTEM THE OTHER THING YOU SEE IS WOMEN WITH TWO CHILDREN. THERE'S A STROLLER- THERE'S USUALLY A BUNCH OF OTHER. THINGS THAT THE WOMAN NEEDS TO CARRY WITH HER. AND THERE'S NO ACCOMMODATION FOR THAT THERE'S A SPOT FOR BIKES ON TRAIN CARS- THERE'S A SPOT OF FOR HANDICAPPED PATRONS ON OUR- BUSES IN A REAL CARS. BUT THERE'S- WHERE IS THE SPOT FOR A WOMAN WITH TWO CHILDREN. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ISSUES LIKE THAT AS WE- AS WE WRITE REVAMPS OUR SYSTEM- WE ARE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF OBVIOUSLY BUILDING A LOT OF THE RAIL. LINES IN THE NEW TRANSIT SYSTEMS WERE STUDYING A LOT OF NEW CORRIDORS THAT CONNECT- TWO MAJOR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND THEY ALL NEED MORE MONEY I WANT TO SIT HERE AND JUST TELL YOU WE NEED MORE MONEY YOU KNOW WE NEED MORE MONEY. WILL WORK WITH YOU AS THESE PROGRAMS AND FOR THE LOOK AT THAT- BUT WE ARE ALSO TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT STUDENT TRANSIT PATH ISSUES THE- ORDER. OF. IT CONSIDERED A. MOTIONS LAST MONTH. THAT LOOK AT GRANTING. TRANSIT TO SEE EVER. IN LA YOU ARE CPAS. IN THERE'S TO MEASURE INSECT. AT THE HAVE TO DO RICK. US TO GRANT FREE PASS TO STUDENTS. SO LOOKING THAT YOU KNOW I'M THE MARKET IS SITTER INTO YOU YOU KNOW WE- MONEY OF. WE NEED BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO. WHEN GOING TO STE JUST GOING TO IN AND SAY MONIES ONLY. THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOUR THERE'S CHALLENGE. IN HELPING PEOPLE WE WANT TO. AND WE'LL ALL WORK THROUGH THAT. THE LAST I WANT TO MAKE. IS JUST AS WE FOR. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT. HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE PANEL- TODAY. WE THINK THERE ARE SOME SURGICAL SOLUTIONS THAT. WE COULD WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON. A IN TERMS OF HOUSING- PASS AFFORDABILITY- HOW WE HELP STUDENTS AND WOMEN MOVE AROUND. AND WE WILL COMMIT TO WORKING WITH- THE LEGISLATURE. ON TRYING TO ADVANCE SOME OF THESE INITIATIVES THAT'LL CLOSE THERE'S A QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND I PRE YOU PACKED A LOT INTO. THREE MINUTES APPROVED THAT BUT I ALSO. THINK THAT EACH OF THE OF TOUCH ON. SOME VERY PRINCIPLES. WAS IMPORTANT FOR AT LEAST ME AND I FOR THIS. TO REFER. ON AND THAT IS HOW MANY OF OUR- TRANSIT THE- MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY RIDE THE BUS. AND HOW THERE IS A NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON. RAIL AND MOVING COMMUNITY BUT ALSO- NOT LOSING SIGHT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF. HOW THE WEATHER'S JUST. PEOPLE BECOME A CUT TO WRITING THE BUS THIS THE ACCESSIBILITY IS MUCH GREATER- BUT WE WILL LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S A AS THE INTRACOASTAL. NEEDS BEING MET AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S GETTING THE SUPPORT THAT IT NEEDS. SENATOR DO. YOU HAVE ANY. QUESTIONS FOR A TIME OKAY AND WITH THAT WE PIVOT AT THE MOMENT I THINK WE COVERED A LOT SUBJECTS TODAY. SUBJECTS SO WE LOOK FOR TO UNIQUE THE PUBLIC WANTS TO SHARE LET ME CHECK REAL QUICK WITH THE STAFF IF WE I KNOW WHEN. EVERYONE SIGN IN THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FILL OUT A CARD SO IF THERE'S A WAY THAT IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION IN YOUR HAVE WRITTEN IT DOWN IF YOU CAN. PRESENT THAT TO. OUR STAFF AND THEY WILL. PRESENTED TO US SO. AND I WANT TO THIS THAT AND AGAIN OUR FOR HOUSE AND THESE MEETINGS THERE SO MUCH TO GET OUT OF THE WAY WANT TO SURE THAT WE HAVE. AND TO HEAR FROM PUBLIC WE ARE UNDER OF A CAN ON. BUT EACH OF THE QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED AND WE WILL OVER IN WRITING IF WE NEED TO DO THAT BUT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO COVER AS MUCH. MANY OF THEM AS WE CAN. TWENTY THREE LET'S SEE OKAY THIS IS FROM JACK MOREAU THANKS FOR BEING HERE YOU'RE WELCOME. WILL TRAINS BE. RUN FREE. THE GUN FREE. AND THEN I YOUR RECOMMENDING THAT WE SEE THE FILM THE JOKER. I'M NOT SURE HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT BUT LET ME JUST SAY THAT- IN TERMS OF THE TRAINS IN BEING GUN FREE- IS THERE A. I'VE BEEN RUNNING I WOULD SAY YOU WERE NOT OPEN CARE HEARING SO AREN'T THEY ALREADY GUN FREE. CURRENTLY THAT'S RIGHT. THIS IS. OKAY MARTIN MARTIN SO ABOUT WARMING. AS LET'S SEE. GLOBAL WARMING IS THE MAIN. TRANSPORTATION THE WORK FOR THE LESSER ACTOR GREW. ADDRESS BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT I'M DO IF YOU CAN JUST COME TO THE MICROPHONE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A FEW HERE I DON'T WANT TO. WHAT MAKES THE TRUE ESSENCE OF YOUR QUESTION GETS A- YEAH OUT. HOUSE KINDA RIGHT THINGS DOWN AS I WAS THE ABOUT BUT I'M A MEMBER OF A GROUP SAID CLIMATE. SO CLIMATE LAW IS LOBBYING CON. TO ENACT A CARBON FEE WITH THE DIVIDEND. AND THE CARBON FEE IDEA WAS NOT MENTIONED BY ANY OF THE PANELS IF WE CAN RAISE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE I WOULD THINK THAT BOSS MEMBER ARE RIDERSHIP WOULD DEFINITELY GO UP. AND THE IDEA OF THE CARBON FEE WITH THE DIVIDEND IS IT DOESN'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY SO THE FEES COLLECTED GOES INTO A FUND THAT THEN. SENDS A SHOULD CHECK TO ALL THE CONSUMERS AND THE CONSUMERS CAN USE THAT. DIVIDEND CHECK TO PAY FOR THE INCREASED PRICE OF THE CARBON BUT THEY CAN USE THAT TO LOWER THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT TO. AND IF. THE HIGH COST OF. ANGERS PEOPLE SUCH TO A LEVEL THAT THEY DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RIDE THE BUS INSTEAD YEAH A- SO ANYWAY- THE CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY IS GOING TO HAVE A REGIONAL CONFERENCE ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND AND TWENTY THIRD. CAL STATE LA YOU CAN GET THERE ON THE TRAIN SO ANYWAY- IS SUGGEST AND RECOMMEND THAT YOU GO TO THE OUR CONFERENCE FOR CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY AT LEAST CHECK OUT CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY ON THE WAY OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE- CAROLEE MONROE. I'M GONNA YOU COME FOR IF YOU'RE HERE. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO. THREE B. H. SURE YOUR QUESTION.

HOWEVER AT MY AGE I HAVE WHEN I'VE WRITTEN ON THE LIGHT RAIL THERE ARE NO RESTROOMS ON THE LIGHT RAIL AND THERE ARE NO RESTROOMS AT THE STATION EXCEPT YOU HAVE TO GO TO UNION STATION.

I JUST SAY THAT'S A GROUP THIS IS WHY WE DO THIS THAT PEOPLE BRING THING UP THAT CAN WORK ON THANK YOU CAROLE. HELLO SO. SEE. OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH TOP OF SO MUCH FOR THE ARE TO TALK WITH YOU AS WAS MENTIONED THE IN EMPIRE IS THE NUMBER ONE HOT SPOT FOR WAREHOUSES IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS A TRANSPORTATION LOCAL AND REGIONAL HEARING NOT ONCE DID I HEAR THAT IMPACT. THAT COMES WITH HAVING THESE WAREHOUSES. IN THERE'S ONE PROPOSED RIGHT NOW AND UPLAND AND IT'S THE LAST MILE DELIVERY. ELEVEN HUNDRED DELIVERY VANS AND A LOT OF HEAVY DUTY DIESEL TRUCKS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. UPLAND IS A RESIDENTIAL CITY WHERE BEDROOM. COMMUNITY THIS WILL SEVERELY IMPACT US. ALSO THE THERE IS A LOT OF ACTIVITY GOING ON BRINGING IN MORE WAREHOUSES THROUGHOUT RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY I WAS VERY SURPRISED NONE OF THAT WAS MENTIONED TODAY AND THE IMPACT ON TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND NOW WITH THE NEW- CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT SYKORA GUIDELINES THAT CAME IN SO FAR AS VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED GREENHOUSE GASES XTERRA. ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCREASED. VEHICLES HEAVY DUTY RIGS ON THE ROAD FROM ALL THESE WAREHOUSES. YES AND I KNOW THAT WE MAY NOT OF- HAD THE SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THE TOPIC BUT I KNOW IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF TRUCK TRAFFIC MAKING ITS WAY FROM THE PORTS. THROUGH THE INLAND EMPIRE THAT IS A GREAT CONCERN THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE I THINK THERE WAS A BILL LAST YEAR OR OBERNOLTE I BELIEVE HAD A BILL THAT ADDRESSED ISSUE OF- WORLD. THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT WHAT IT MEANT IN TERMS OF THE- INCREASE IN. WAREHOUSES AND MANUFACTURING. OF THAT OR WERE WELL HOUSING THAT WAS GOING TO. MAKE ITS WAY INTO THE AREA AS WELL SO I THINK WE'RE WE'RE CLEARLY HERE. PREPARE TO TAKE NOTES AND TO REGISTER YOUR YOUR ISSUE AND CONCERN- IT'S ALSO. SOME OF IT IS LAND USE IN TERMS OF HOW. OF CITING AND PLANNING OF THESE TYPE OF FACILITIES OR IDENTIFY FOR COMMUNITY BUT AS IT RELATES TO THE TRUCK TRAFFICKING THAT'S ONE THAT WE'RE- AWARE OF AND CONTINUE TO TRY TO FIND. SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS BUT WE'RE WE'RE HERE TODAY TO ALSO TAKE DOWN. THAT CONCERN AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET BACK TO YOU WITH SOME AND THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE FIRST IN THE LAST OF OUR OR MEETINGS AND GET TOGETHER THERE. SENATOR WILL HAVE MEETINGS I WILL JOIN I'LL HAVE MEETINGS WILL JOIN. ME AND ANSWER. TRICKS A CONTINUE TO HAVE A CAR HOW WE CAN MAKE AND GET OUR ARMS ARE THE ISSUE THANK AS WHEN HOW WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE HEAVY DO DIESEL ISSUE AT THE PORT. IT'S A SECRET HERE IN IN EMPIRE THAT THAT WE JUST OF. IN ISSUE WITH THE WAREHOUSE. RIGHT THE KEY. NEEDS BECOME FOR ABOUT QUIRK SEQUEL IS THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT FOR THEIR VOICE TO BE HEARD JUST NOT ONLY. YOUR JOB IT'S OUR JOB TO WE NEED TO PUSH BACK IN EVERY PERSON COUNTS. REVOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN STARTED BY ONE SHORT SPEECH THANK YOU AND THAT'S WHY I MENTIONED GENERAL PLANS AND LOCAL COMMUNITY RIGHT IN IN SOME OF THESE. YES THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO READ THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS LOOK AT THEIR GENERAL PLAN JUST BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL THE INITIAL STUDY SAYS IS COMPLIANCE WITH THE CITY'S GENERAL PLAN THAT DOES NOT MEAN IT DOES. AND IF I MAY WE'VE BEEN BATTLING THIS- PROBLEM SINCE I WAS ELECTED SIX YEARS AGO IN MY DISTRICT SENATE DISTRICT TWENTY AND AS YOU HEARD ME SAY WE HAVE MORE WAREHOUSES IS INDUSTRY TWENTY THAN ANY PLACE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY. AND IT IS THIS IS A WE CAN TRY AND WORK ON IT AT THE STATE LEVEL WHICH WE DO OUR INTERVIEWS BEST SB ONE THOUSAND WHICH THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A COUPLE YEARS AGO. ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL- JUSTICE IN- CITY PLANS AND ON THE TRIP BIG BILL- THE BIG RIG BILL THAT I TALKED ABOUT NOW THE BIG RIGS HAVE TO HAVE A SMOG CHECK THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO EVER HAVE THAT BEFORE. BUT THIS REALLY STARTS AT THE CITY LEVEL AND I TALKED TO MANY MANY MARES ABOUT WHY DO YOU CONTINUE TO LET THESE WAREHOUSES BE BUILT BECAUSE THEY BRING IN TRAFFIC NOISE POLLUTION AND USUALLY REALLY BAD JOBS SO WE CAN DO STUFF AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT WE NEED PEOPLE AT YOUR CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS WE NEED THAT COUNTIES DOING THEIR JOB ON THIS. WE CAN'T FIX IT ALL THE STATE LEVEL AND SO MUCH CAN HAPPEN FASTER AT THE CITY AND THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT WE NEED RESIDENTS LIKE YOU TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING GO TO MEETING SPEAK UP- WE HAVE DONE SO MANY OF THESE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THIS WHO YOU ELECT MATTERS WE'VE HAD MEMBERS OF ALL THE COMMUNITY OF BLOOMINGTON WHO HAVE HAD PETITIONS SIGNED WHO HAVE HAD PEOPLE OUT IN FRONT OF FOR AT THE MEETINGS AND STILL THE- ON COUNTY BOARDS SUPERVISORS CHOSE TO BUILD.
