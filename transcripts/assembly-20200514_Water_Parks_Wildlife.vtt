02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:35.060
VALLEY'S DRINKING WATER SUPPLY.

02:05:35.127 --> 02:05:36.562
I MENTIONED THAT THE DAM WAS

02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:39.064
BUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTY. AND IT

02:05:39.131 --> 02:05:40.933
WAS BUILT TO THE SAFETY

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.669
STANDARDS OF THAT TIME. BUT AS

02:05:43.736 --> 02:05:45.304
WE NOW KNOW THE DAM WAS

02:05:45.371 --> 02:05:47.439
CONSTRUCTED ALONG TO EARTHQUAKE

02:05:47.506 --> 02:05:50.342
FAULT LINES. THE CALAVERAS

02:05:50.409 --> 02:05:52.077
FAULT WHICH IS A MAJOR BRANCH

02:05:52.144 --> 02:05:53.946
OF THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT SYSTEM

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:56.415
AND THE DAM ALSO SITS DIRECTLY

02:05:56.482 --> 02:05:58.617
ABOVE THE COYOTE CREEK PAULINE.

02:05:58.684 --> 02:06:00.819
SECOND THIS ISSUE IS A REGIONAL

02:06:00.886 --> 02:06:02.955
ONE AS I STATED THIS DAM IS THE

02:06:03.022 --> 02:06:04.023
LARGEST RESERVOIR IN SANTA

02:06:04.089 --> 02:06:05.224
CLARA COUNTY AND IT'S A

02:06:05.291 --> 02:06:06.525
CRITICAL PART OF THE SILICON

02:06:06.592 --> 02:06:09.161
VALLEY. THE SILICON VALLEY

02:06:09.228 --> 02:06:10.896
DRINKING WATER SUPPLY. WHEN

02:06:10.963 --> 02:06:13.565
ANDERSON DAM WAS COMPLETED IN

02:06:13.632 --> 02:06:14.566
NINETEEN FIFTY SANTA CLARA

02:06:14.633 --> 02:06:16.702
COUNTY WAS A VERY PRODUCTIVE.

02:06:16.769 --> 02:06:18.270
AGRICULTURAL REGION WITH A

02:06:18.337 --> 02:06:20.639
POPULATION OF TWO HUNDRED

02:06:20.706 --> 02:06:26.278
NINETY THOUSAND. AND AS WE ALL

02:06:26.345 --> 02:06:29.348
KNOW NOW THE CARD COUNTY. IT'S

02:06:29.415 --> 02:06:30.416
AN INTERNATIONAL HUB OF THE

02:06:30.482 --> 02:06:32.651
TECH ECONOMY WITH A POPULATION

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:35.220
NEARLY TWO MILLION. THE CITY OF

02:06:35.287 --> 02:06:37.022
SAN JOSE THE COUNTY SEAT IS

02:06:37.089 --> 02:06:38.057
CURRENTLY THE THIRD LARGEST

02:06:38.123 --> 02:06:40.993
CITY IN CALIFORNIA THE TENTH

02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:41.627
LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS

02:06:41.694 --> 02:06:46.332

02:06:46.398 --> 02:06:47.566
SCENT OF A REGION HOME OF THE

02:06:47.633 --> 02:06:49.535
SILICON VALLEY IS A VITAL

02:06:49.601 --> 02:06:51.236
CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR STATE AND

02:06:51.303 --> 02:06:53.706
NATIONAL ECONOMY. AND IS EDISON

02:06:53.772 --> 02:06:55.674
DAM ISSUE POSES SOME SERIOUS

02:06:55.741 --> 02:06:58.644
PROBLEMS FOR THE REGION. THE

02:06:58.711 --> 02:07:00.312
DAM HAS SOME SERIOUS STRUCTURAL

02:07:00.379 --> 02:07:02.848
INTEGRITY ISSUES. IN THE EVENT

02:07:02.915 --> 02:07:04.583
OF AN EARTHQUAKE THE BRIDGE OF

02:07:04.650 --> 02:07:05.884
THE DAM AT FULL CAPACITY WOULD

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:07.953
BE CATASTROPHIC. IN THAT

02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:09.655
SCENARIO IS PREDICTED THAT FROM

02:07:09.722 --> 02:07:11.523
THE SIDE OF THE DAM. FLOODING

02:07:11.590 --> 02:07:12.658

SUNNYVALE IN MILPITAS. AND

02:07:23.469 --> 02:07:24.837
FLOODING WOULD ALSO EXTEND

02:07:24.903 --> 02:07:26.638
ANOTHER FORTY MILES SOUTHEAST

WELL. I KNOW THE AUTHOR CARES

02:41:55.038 --> 02:41:57.240
ABOUT JOSHUA TREE- BUT THIS

02:41:57.307 --> 02:41:59.242
BILL ANALYSIS MAKES PAINFULLY

02:41:59.309 --> 02:42:01.978
CLEAR THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:42:02.045 --> 02:42:03.513
PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL AND THE

02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:05.715

NOT AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

02:42:08.952 --> 02:42:10.987

IT'S INOPERABLE SECOND DESPITE

02:42:18.128 --> 02:42:19.896
THE FEDERAL LAW PREEMPTION. THE

02:42:29.573 --> 02:42:31.174
THE BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE

02:42:31.241 --> 02:42:32.542
WEEPING ENCOURAGE YOU PERHAPS

02:42:32.609 --> 02:42:34.010

02:42:34.077 --> 02:42:36.513
BY TREATING. EIGHT A PENALTY

02:42:36.580 --> 02:42:37.914
SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY LIMITS

02:42:37.981 --> 02:42:39.850
WHAT THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS

02:42:39.916 --> 02:42:40.484
CURRENTLY THERE'S NO CAP AT THE

02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:43.887

02:42:43.954 --> 02:42:46.623

ACTIONS THAT LIKE I SAID IN THE

02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:51.728
BILL ANALYSIS THAT IT PREVENTS

02:42:51.795 --> 02:42:54.698
IT FROM TAKING IT INVITES

02:42:54.764 --> 02:42:56.466
COSTLY A LITIGATION. WE'RE

02:42:56.533 --> 02:42:57.968
GOING TO BE IN THE RED IN THE

02:42:58.034 --> 02:42:59.336

ANY SEEPAGE LOSSES. AND THEN TO

02:56:16.899 --> 02:56:18.367
IF THEY'RE WE DETECT THAT THERE

02:56:18.434 --> 02:56:21.070

02:57:17.994 --> 02:57:20.830
BILL MISTER CHAIR HI APPRECIATE

02:57:20.896 --> 02:57:23.332
YOU PUTTING FORWARD- WHAT I SEE

02:57:23.399 --> 02:57:26.635
ON ITS FACE IS AN ATTEMPT TO

02:57:26.702 --> 02:57:27.670
STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL

02:57:27.737 --> 02:57:29.105
PROTECTIONS IT'S INTERESTING

02:57:29.171 --> 02:57:30.506
THAT YOUR YOUR MOTIVES HERE

02:57:30.573 --> 02:57:32.308
INTENTIONS ARE RE REALLY BEING.

02:57:32.375 --> 02:57:34.510
CALLED OUT HERE AND THAT'S AN

02:57:34.577 --> 02:57:36.746
UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE FOR ANY OF

02:57:36.812 --> 02:57:40.483
US TO BE. AND YOU HAVE- YOU

02:57:40.549 --> 02:57:41.617
HAVE BEEN A SUPPORTER OF THIS

02:57:41.684 --> 02:57:43.085
PROJECT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

02:57:43.152 --> 02:57:45.054
THAT YOU CAN'T ALSO BE A

02:57:45.121 --> 02:57:46.555
SUPPORTER OF OUR NATURAL

02:57:46.622 --> 02:57:47.823
ENVIRONMENT. I DON'T I DON'T

02:57:47.890 --> 02:57:49.025
THINK THOSE TWO HAVE TO BE

02:57:49.091 --> 02:57:50.960
SEPARATE AND I THINK THAT

02:57:51.027 --> 02:57:53.229
YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED INCREDIBLE

02:57:53.295 --> 02:57:54.530
ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP IN

02:57:54.597 --> 02:57:54.997
YOUR TIME HERE IN THE

02:57:55.064 --> 02:57:56.432
LEGISLATURE. I THINK THAT THOSE

02:57:56.499 --> 02:58:00.269
DUAL MOTIVES CAN EXIST TOGETHER

02:58:00.336 --> 02:58:01.337
TO SUPPORT A PROJECT BUT ALSO

02:58:01.404 --> 02:58:03.105
TO SAY. WE HAVE SHARED

02:58:03.172 --> 02:58:04.407
ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES AND WE

02:58:04.473 --> 02:58:05.875
WANT TO PUT THEM FORWARD IT

02:58:05.941 --> 02:58:07.943
REMINDED ME. WHEN I FIRST HEARD

02:58:08.010 --> 02:58:10.146
ABOUT THIS BILL OF- CENTER

02:58:10.212 --> 02:58:12.248
ATKINS SP ONE LAST YEAR WHICH-

02:58:12.314 --> 02:58:15.551
I SUPPORTED. WAS GOING TO HOLD-

02:58:15.618 --> 02:58:17.486
STATE STANDARDS AS HIGH AS

02:58:17.553 --> 02:58:19.488
PRIOR FEDERAL STANDARDS- THE

02:58:19.555 --> 02:58:21.857
GOVERNOR HAD VETO THAT BILL-

02:58:21.924 --> 02:58:23.125
BECAUSE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS

02:58:23.192 --> 02:58:23.993
AND I THINK THAT THOSE CONCERNS

02:58:24.060 --> 02:58:26.395
ALSO AT THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS

02:58:26.462 --> 02:58:27.063
BUT CONCERNS ABOUT SOME

02:58:27.129 --> 02:58:30.766
CONFLICTS. STILL HOVER AROUND

02:58:30.833 --> 02:58:34.036
THIS BILL AS WELL. BUT THAT

02:58:34.103 --> 02:58:34.837
YOU'RE YOU'RE APPROACHING IT

02:58:34.904 --> 02:58:36.906
FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE. YOUR

SO BEFORE ON A FEDERALLY

02:58:53.522 --> 02:58:55.758
APPROVED PROJECT. AND I THINK

02:58:55.825 --> 02:58:57.660
THAT THIS IS A TEST THAT'S

02:58:57.726 --> 02:58:59.862
WORTHY OF PUTTING FORWARD. AND

02:58:59.929 --> 02:59:02.364
