AS STUDENTS RETURN TO SCHOOL AMIDST. UNSETTLING TIMES AND AS THE DELTA VARIANT CONTINUES TO LOOM. WILL EXPLORE WAYS TO MINIMIZE ANY FURTHER ACADEMIC OR SOCIAL LOSSES FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND LEARN ABOUT HOW THE STATE AND OUR PARTNERS ARE HELPING SCHOOLS PRIORITIZE STUDENTS SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS. TO RETURN BOOSTED THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. AS WE'RE ALL AWARE DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR- MOST STUDENTS HAD BY TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR THE PAST TWO YEARS. MOST UNITS HAD RELATIVELY LITTLE IN PERSON INTERACTION WITH THEIR TEACHERS. OR WITH ONE ANOTHER AND NOW AS THEY RETURN IN PERSON TO CLASSROOMS IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT MANY OF THEM MAY BE RETURNING DIFFERENT. THAN WHEN THEY LEFT NOT IN MANY CASES MORE RESERVED. IN MANY CASES MUCH MORE ANXIOUS WHILE OTHERS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY LOST. TO THE CHALLENGES OF REMOTE LEARNING DURING THAT TIME. HOPEFULLY SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE SUMMER FOR STUDENTS TO ENGAGE WITH EACH OTHER AND RECONNECT WITH OTHERS. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. WITH APPROPRIATE DISEASE MITIGATION STRATEGIES LIKE MASK WEARING FREQUENT HAND SANITIZING AND SOCIAL DISTANCING IN PLACE. THIS SUMMER AN EXTENDED LEARNING PROGRAMS WE HEAR ABOUT TODAY OR INTENDED TO SET A FOUNDATION FOR HELPING OUR STUDENTS TEACHERS. AND OTHER SCHOOL PERSONNEL REESTABLISHED THE CONNECTIONS. WITH ONE ANOTHER AS WE CONTINUE TO EMERGE. FROM THIS PANDEMIC AND BEYOND. WHATEVER MODEL INSTRUCTION STUDENTS ENCOUNTER THIS FALL THERE WILL BE ONE CONSTANT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING NEEDS WILL BE HIGHER. THAN EVER BEFORE WE URGE THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY. IN THEIR EFFORTS TO KEEP STUDENTS PHYSICALLY SAFE. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR STRUGGLES AND PRIORITIZE THEIR WELL BEING IT IS. MORE URGENT NOW. THAN EVER. HAVING DOUBTS. SOME OF WHAT TODAY'S HEARING WILL BE ABOUT I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY ALSO IMPORTANT TO STATE CLEARLY WHAT TODAY'S HEARING IS NOT ABOUT TODAY'S HEARING IS NOT ABOUT MASKING. AT LEAST NOT ABOUT PROSPECTIVE PLANS OR POLICIES THAT MAY ULTIMATELY ULTIMATELY PUT IN PEOPLE BEING PUT. IN PLACE STATEWIDE. WORN ANY PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICT NEITHER IS TODAY'S DISCUSSION ABOUT VACCINATIONS THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT ISSUES. AND SUBJECT TO INTENSELY HELD VIEWS WHAT IS THE GOAL OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO TALK ABOUT APPROACHES TO. AND LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT TEACHING AND LEARNING IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC. WE WILL BE D. B. DELIBERATELY BE LEAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THESE OTHER OBVIOUSLY CONTENTIOUS TOPICS FOR OTHER VENUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND. AS YOU CONSIDERING OFFERING PUBLIC COMMENT.

THANK YOU TO ALL THE PRESENTERS THIS MORNING AND FOR ALL THOSE LEADING THESE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS IN OUR DISTRICT MY HEART IS BROKEN FOR STUDENTS OVER THE PAST SEVENTEEN MONTHS I'VE HEARD NUMEROUS STORIES ABOUT STUDENTS WHO USED TO LOVE SCHOOL WHO HAVE COME TO HATED IN THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT STUDENTS WHO THRIVED UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES DID POORLY IN VIRTUAL SUBMISSIONS I'VE SAID IT BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN HE'S JUST GOT DECISIONS SHOULD ALSO BE LEFT TO THE LOCALS WHO CAN BEST MAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR THEIR STUDENTS. THEY ARE EXPERTS IN COMPLETELY CAPABLE OF DECIDING WHAT THEIR COMMUNITIES NEED AND THEY HAVE DIRECT CONDUITS TO GETTING THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE TEACHERS STAFF PARENTS AND STUDENTS. HOWEVER WE NEED TO ALSO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM LIABILITY. IN ORDER TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DEVELOP POLICY THAT IS BALANCED CONDUCIVE TO THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND NOT BASED ON FEAR. AGAIN I'M THANKFUL THAT WE HAVE SO MANY OFFICIALS FROM ACROSS THE STATE HERE TODAY BUT WE NEED TO TAKE ACTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOW.

BIG CENTER OF CHUBB OKAY ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO WISH TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT SEEING THEN I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE FIRST PANEL WE WILL BE HEARING FROM DAVE GORDEN. WHO'S A COMMISSIONER WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT INCOME ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. ALSO WILL BE HEARING FROM OUR OWN STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMAN. MR MATSON OF OUR NOVEL THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE. MR GORDON PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD MORNING SENATORS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME IT'S MY HONOR TO SPEAK HERE TODAY GOOD MORNING DAVE GORDON. AS WAS MENTIONED I'M A COMMISSIONER WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AND I ALSO SERVES THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. SUPPORTING THIRTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN ORDER TO HELP THE- I'M ALSO A PROUD GRANDPA THE. THE GIRL WHO SPENT THE- SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL. IN FRONT OF THE ZOOM SCREEN AND- I'VE I'VE I'VE WATCHED WHAT HAPPENED TO HER IN THIS PERIOD SO I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING OUR STATE LEADERS. GOVERNOR NEWSOM IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR PROVIDING AN EXTRAORDINARY INVESTMENT OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO SUPPORT SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH BY BRINGING OUR SCHOOL AND MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS CLOSER TOGETHER AND HOPEFULLY TO FUNCTION MUCH MORE AS ONE SYSTEM. I WANT TO EXPRESS THANKS TO SUPERINTENDENT TONY BURMAN THE CD IN OUR STATE BORDER OF EDUCATION FOR STEPPING UP WITH LEADERSHIP FOR DISTRICTS BUT MOST OF ALL HAVING GONE AROUND TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR TEACHERS COUNSELORS CLINICIANS AND OTHER SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND LEADERS WHO HAVE REALLY STEPPED UP TO EMBRACE THEMSELVES THEIR STAFFS AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULARLY DURING THIS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT PERIOD YOUR WORK I CAN TELL YOU. IT'S BEEN A ROLLER CAN LIKE CHANGING IT UP INCLUDED IN MY PREPARED REMARKS SOME EXAMPLES SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON IN MY OWN COUNTY. I'M ALSO PROUD TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION INITIATIVES AND THE COMMISSION IS LED BY CHAIRMAN ASPECT VICE CHAIR TOMORROW MY WIFE. AND OUR. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TOLD THE US. AND LATE LAST YEAR THE COMMISSION PRODUCED A REPORT ON SO IN MENTAL WE ARE MEANT TO YOU CALL. EVERY YOUR HEART AND MIND SCHOOLS AS CENTRES OF WELLNESS. THEN THE REPORT LAID OUT A BLUEPRINT FOR MAKING SCHOOLS CENTERS OF WELLNESS FOCUSING. ON NOT JUST TREATMENT BUT ALSO ON PREVENTION. ALSO THROUGH THE SNAPPLE HELP STUDENTS SERVICES ACT FUNDING PROVIDED IN THE STATE BUDGET. THIS WILL ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO GO BEYOND THE EXISTING EIGHTEEN LOCAL COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS THE FUND NOT JUST A FEW BUT EVERY COUNTY. IN SUPPORTING ROBUST COUNTY SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS WHICH IS WHERE MUCH OF THE REAL WORK IS PERFORMED. IN TERMS OF YOUR VOICE AND YOU CAN GAUGE AND AS ADULTS WE OFTEN ASSUME WE KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR CHILDREN YOUR BEST BET I'M NOT LEANING MORE. ON OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HELP US UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS. OR COMMISSION I'M PROUD TO SAY IS LET'S WAIT TWO WORDS THE STATE TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE. THE VOICE OF YOUTH AND STUDENTS. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THE COMMISSION SPONSORED THE YOUTH ENGAGEMENT PROJECT. THAT CREATED USE IDEAL LAUGHS AND ARE YOU SO I CAN TELL YOU ARE COMING UPS WITH SOME AMAZING IDEAS WE NEED TO LISTEN TO THEM MORE. WHEN ASKED WHAT TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS OR SERVICES CAN BE MOST HELPFUL YOUNG PEOPLE SPOKE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WAYS TO EMPOWER THEM TO SHARE THEIR OWN VOICES AND PERSPECTIVES. THAT SHAPE OUR DECISIONS I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS ABOUT HOW WE CAN BEST SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT GETTING THOSE ANSWERS NEEDS TO INCLUDE ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE. IN THE PROCESS. LOCALLY IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WERE SPONSORING AN INITIATIE TO PLACE MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS IN EVERY SCHOOL THAT WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED OR MORE SCHOOLS. MONTEL HEALTH CLINICIAN THAT EVERY ONE OF THOSE SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTY. WE HAVE A PHASED ROLLOUT WE'RE UP TO ABOUT TWENTY SCHOOLS WITH THE GOAL OF REACHING MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED. THE NATION'S WORKING IN EACH SCHOOL ARE OUR EMPLOYEES SUPPORTED BY SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. FROM MEDICARE HELLO I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUSTAINABILITY OF FUNDING. WE'RE ALSO SUPPORTING A STATEWIDE COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE WHICH WAS INITIALLY FUNDED BY FEMA. THE N. B. IS GOING TO BE CONTINUED FUNDING THROUGH SEPTEMBER SOME OF THE STATE'S MONEY AND THAT PROVIDES A FORUM FOR HELPING US BUILD A COMMUNITY OF FIRST RESPONDERS AND IT HAS BEEN VERY WELL RECEIVED- THROUGHOUT THE- PROPERTY OF THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. SO IN CONCLUSION WE NOW UNDERSTAND CLEARLY BUT AS YOUNG PEOPLE COME BACK TO SCHOOL FIRST AND FOREMOST THEY WILL NEED A SAFE SUPPORTIVE SPACE AND STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH CARING ADULTS. THIS WILL TAKE MORE TIME WITH SOME STUDENTS SOME WITH OTHERS. BUT IS THAT IT IS NECESSARY PATHWAY TO ADDRESSING THEIR ACT NEEDS. RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC WILL NOT GO AWAY WHEN WE ARE BROUGHT DOWN INSTRUCTIONS RATES. LESSONS FROM OTHER LARGE SCALE DISASTERS SUCH AS KATRINA WHEN THE DEEPWATER HORIZON OIL. SUGGESTED FEAR ANXIETY AND RELATED MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WILL IMPACT STUDENTS FOR THREE TO FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THIS PANDEMIC IF NOT LONGER. AND IT IS SAID THAT OUT OF CRISIS COMES OPPORTUNITY AND THAT IS SO TRUE TODAY AND IN THE CASE OF WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON. TODAY WE'REFINALLY ON OUR WAY TOWARDS BUILDING A STRONG PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN HEALTH AND EDUCATION SYSTEMS. TO SUSTAIN AND SUPPORT NOT JUST MENTAL HEALTH. OVERALL HEALTH AND PREVENTION SERVICES FOR ALL OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES IT IS SO ENCOURAGING LEADERSHIP THE OWNER STATE SUPERINTENDENT AND ALL OTHER LEADERS HAVE TAKEN THIS INITIATIVE. LET'S NOT WASTE IT LET'S NOT. LET'S NOT SQUANDER THE OPPORTUNITY INSTEAD LET'S SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY THE PANDEMIC IS PRESENTED US WITH AND GET THIS WORKED OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER GORDON INSIGHTS MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO COMPLETE THE PANEL AND THEN I WILL ASK FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM ALL OF YOU NEXT WE'RE GOING TO% GO TO OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMAN. SUPERINTENDENT ARE YOU WITH US. YES HI THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA. CENTER IN NEW ENGLAND- CENTERS- ACTUAL BOGAN ANY OTHERS OF US WHO ARE PARTICIPATING- TONY THURMAN STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO BE ON THIS PANEL SUPERINTENDENT GORDON AND WITH MANY NAVAJOS HEADING UP OUR OUR GREAT- WAY OF A NEW ISSUE FOR CLOSING- OPPORTUNITY GAPS IN. PEOPLE LIKE ALEX BRISCOE AND OTHERS WHO'VE BEEN WORKING ON MENTAL HEALTH. WHAT ARE SCHOOLS FOR A LONG TIME- IT YOU KNOW I DON'T NEED TO UNDER ITS UNDER I CAN'T STATE ENOUGH HOW DIFFICULT THESE LAST EIGHTEEN. MONTHS HAVE BEEN FOR EVERYONE I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST EXPERIENCES THAT. WE WILL ALL UNDERGO IN OUR LIFETIME. YOU KNOW LIKE TO JUST START BY ACKNOWLEDGING OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE RESILIENCE- AS DIFFICULT AS THIS TRAUMA HAS BEEN. OUR STUDENTS ARE RESILIENT- THEY WILL CONTINUE TO LEARN AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO THRIVE. BUT THE TOPIC THAT YOU HAVE RAISED IS A CRITICAL ONE. WE MUST ADDRESS THEIR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING NEEDS AND WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE. THE RIGHT SUPPORTS TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE TRAUMA WE'LL MUST ALSOPROVIDE THAT SUPPORT FOR ALL OF OUR EDUCATORS ARE AND I WANT TO THANK OUR CLASSIFIED AS A DUPLICATED STAFF AND OUR ADMINISTRATORS. FOR DOING THIS VERY DIFFICULT WORK FOR WHICH THERE IS NO PLAYBOOK. FOR HOW TO NAVIGATE A PANDEMIC. AND IT'S JUST BEEN AS DIFFICULT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU. BUT PUTTING IT IN CONTEXT RECOGNIZING THAT OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THAT LOST LOVED ONES. PEOPLE HAVE LOST JOBS. HOMES IN THE DURING THE PANDEMIC AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC OUR SCHOOLS ARE PROVIDED. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION MEALS TO HUNGRY CHILDREN- THIS IS AGAIN THE MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGE THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE. IN OUR LIFETIME DURING THE PANDEMIC OUR OFFICE HAS WORKED WITH DISTRICTS AND COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS PROVIDE NEW RESOURCES NEW CREDIT ACCOUNTS IN COALITION BECAUSE WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUR STUDENTS COULDN'T GET ACCESS TO COUNSELORS. EVEN BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY THE LACK OF DEVICES TO CONNECT. WE KNOW THAT OUR STUDENTS EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS AND DEPRESSION- IT AND THEN INCREASE RATES AND SUICIDE AS A PANDEMIC GOT UNDERWAY. AND. WE KNOW THAT OUR STUDENTS WILL EXPERIENCE SOME JUST. AS THEY COME BACK TO SCHOOL AND SO WE CREATED THE AND COALITION. WE CREATED STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE HATE THAT MANY STUDENTS SAW IMPACTS OF RACE AND- RACISM AND BIAS THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD THE SPIKE IN HATE. AGAINST THE ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES ALL THESE THINGS ADDED TO THE STRESS THAT OUR STUDENTS WERE DEALING WITH ON TOP OF THE STRESS OF THE PANDEMIC. ITSELF AND SO WE'VE ADDED YOU KNOW STAFF AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF EQUITY WE'VE ADDED A FAMILY ENGAGEMENT UNIT WE'VE ADDED A YOUTH ADVISORY COUNCIL SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE. CAN HELP US HELP OTHER STUDENTS IN NAVIGATING THE STRESS THAT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT WHILE IT'S CHALLENGING OUR STUDENTS ARE DOING WELL. I'VE HAD THE PERSONAL PRIVILEGE OF VISITING MANY MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS THEY ARE OPENING AND PREPARING TO REOPEN. YEAH AND IN ALL THE DISTRICTS I'VE VISITED YOU KNOW IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR MORE THAN RETURNED TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WE KNOW THAT THAT IS THE DEFAULT THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS. WHEN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE EDUCATORS WHEN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR PEERS AND FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT WE APPRECIATE THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED. SOME ABILITY FOR SOME FORM OF INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR STUDENTS WITH. MEDICAL NECESSITY OR OTHER NEEDS BUT WE KNOW THAT OUR STUDENTS. NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IT'S BEEN GREAT TO VISIT SO MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND TO SEE OUR STUDENTS RETURNING. AND JUST SEE THE ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT. FROM STUDENTS AND FROM THEIR PARENTS. WE ALSO SEE SOME LEVEL OF ANXIETY- THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN THE WORLD AND IN TERMS OF. THE CORONA VIRUS- KOBE NINETEEN VIRUS SCAN IT THE LATEST- YOU KNOW BEARING AND SO WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES. BUT WE CAN NAVIGATE THESE CHALLENGES AND WE WORK WITH OUR SCHOOLS WE WORK WITH OUR FAMILIES TO HELP NAVIGATE DOWN OUR OFFICE IS WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OTHERS TO PROVIDE. FIVE MILLION RAPID COLBY TESTS TO HELP OUR SCHOOLS HAVE AWARENESS ABOUT ADDRESSING- WHO MIGHT BE A POSITIVE FOR COVERT SO THAT WE CAN HELP FAMILIES QUARANTINE. AND HELP OTHERS- YOU'LL BE ABLE TO STAY SAFE IN THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST STRESSORS IS KOBE ITSELF. AND FOR CHILDREN WHO COME TO SCHOOL- WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES WHO'VE EXPERIENCED LOSS IN YOUR COMMUNITY A LOVED ONE HAS LOST A HOME OR A JOB. WE DO SEE SOME EVIDENCE OF STRESS THAT THEY MAY BE DEALING WITH I WANT TO COMMEND SOME OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT. BUT THE CHULA VISTA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT THIS IS A DISTRICT WITH FIFTY THREE SCHOOLS. EVERY ONE OF THE SCHOOLS HAS A COUNSELOR OR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST OR SOCIAL WORKER WHO IS ATTENDING TO THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. THIS WAS LARGELY OUT OF THE INVESTMENTS MADE BY YOU ALL OF YOU OUR LEGISLATORS OUR GOVERNOR AND WE WERE GLAD TO WORK WITH YOU ON HOW.

IMPORTANT WORDS ABOUT VACCINATION AND HOW THAT IS GOING TO HELP US STOP THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE IN OUR SCHOOLS AS WELL AS OUR STATE- SOMEONE RECOGNIZE- DAVE GORDON WHO COURSE SAYS- ABLY HELPING US OUT IS- THE- SUPERINTENDENT OF- THE SEGMENT OF COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION HERE IN MY OWN DISTRICT AS WELL. I GUESS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS THAT IS- AND I KNOW THAT- SUPERTANKER AND ALSO SERVES ON THE- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AS WELL IS- YOU KNOW WE KNOW THERE'S A LARGE. DEMAND AND NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR- FOR OUR STUDENTS AND OUR- CHILDREN AND- WELL THINGS THAT IS WE'RE DOING THIS HEARING IS THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE LEVERAGE ALL THE DIFFERENT RESOURCES AND- YES MY QUESTION IS THAT SO WHAT DO YOU SEE IS THE ROLE OF THAT SAMPLE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS- SO MANY. CHILDREN DO YOU HAVE A PEDIATRICIAN OR FAMILY PHYSICIAN WHO IS- PROVIDING PRIMARY CARE- WE KNOW THERE'S A SHORTAGE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- PROFESSIONALS- BOTH IN THE COMMUNITY AND EVEN IN SCHOOLS. SO HOW HOW DO YOU SEE- DEVELOPING SYSTEMS THAT- BASICALLY NOT ONLY OF COURSE INTEGRATE SOME OF THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SPECIALISTS THAT PERHAPS IN THE COUNTY AND OTHER PLACES BUT ALSO PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AS WELL AND BUILDING COLLABORATIONS- WITH US SCHOOLS TO TRY TO. AGAIN PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES AND- FOR- STUDENTS- IS THERE BEING IS THERE GOING TO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. BOB ALL GOLD I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A SHOT AT THAT QUESTION- THANK YOU SENATOR AND- AND THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR- EFFORTS LOCALLY IN SACRAMENTO TO- TO STAND UP FOR OUR- YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR NEEDS IT'S SO APPRECIATED. R. A. D. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALSIS A CRYING NEED AS I SAID WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING TO FIND UP TO THREE HUNDRED. PROFESSIONALS JUST TO SEND OUT TO OUR SCHOOLS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON BOTH THE COMMISSION AND LOCALLY. IS A WORKFORCE PIPELINE. WHERE WE MIGHT- SO UP MATH TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET INTO THE FIELD TO HELP SUPPORT THEM THROUGH. MENTORSHIPS INTERNSHIPS SO THAT THEY CAN BE SUPPORTED OR GOING THROUGH SCHOOL STAY IN TOUCH WITH THEM ENCOURAGE THEM. IN CHURCH AND TO COME BACK- AND WORK IN OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS- AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES I THINK YOUR IDEA ABOUT REACHING OUT TO. A PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS IS- IS OUTSTANDING AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO WITH OUR INITIATIVES. THAT WE HAVE WORKING CLOSELY WITH COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH AND ALSO WITH OUR OUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS OR MANAGED CARE FOR BUYERS- AND OUR HEALTH SYSTEMS AND THAT'S ON OUR AGENDA TO. DO LOCALLY AND STATEWIDE AS A COMMISSION WE SHOULD. DR PANS OUT IF I COULD ADD ON TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO COURT AND SAY- OUR OUR OWN SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SAID DR GALLEY. IS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN THAT WOULD DO IT SHE SAID BRING UP MANAGED CARE PROVIDERS INTO THE CONVERSATION YUP I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF HOW WE USE MEDICARE DOLLARS BUT AS YOU KNOW. WE HAD MANY FAMILIES THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE- YOU KNOW DON'T EARN A LOT OF MONEY THEY STILL DON'T THEY EARN TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAMS AND SO- WHAT DR KELLY'S PLAN WILL DO- AND I THINK IT BUILDS OFF OF THE FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. FOR MENTAL HEALTH FROM AGES ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE WE'LL BRING ALL PROVIDERS TOGETHER- FROM BOTH THE SCHOOL COMMUNITIES AND THE MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH PROVIDERS AND IT WILL HELP US TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW MANY OF US HAVE STRUGGLED WITH FOR A LONG TIME. FILLING THOSE GAPS THAT EXIST IN THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH INTO THE METAL HEALTH ADVISORY OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES OUT HAS BEEN A REALLY CRITICAL IN HELPINGTO. THINK ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A MORE COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM SO I THINK AGAIN- THE FUNDING CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A BETTER SYSTEM- THAT WILL ENVISION ALL PROVIDERS BEING PART. OF THE DELIVERY- SYSTEM. NO REALLY PRETTY THE ANTS- FOR THIS. PRIOR TO MEETING THE LEGISLATURE AS ACTUALLY THE MEDICAL CONSULTANT FOR SEX SECOND CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND PARTNERED WITH SCHOOL NURSES AND PSYCHOLOGISTS TO. BASIC FIGURE HOW WE CAN BETTER INTEGRATE- CARE FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS INCLUDING ADHD SO WE WEREN'T IN KOBE BACK THEN BUT WE WERE DEATHS. HOW DO WE LINK EDUCATION AND HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE TOGETHER. RIGHT AND SO OF COURSE YOU KNOW- NOT ONLY OF COURSE FOR. THE HALF OF CHILDREN WHO ARE ON MEDICARE NOW BUT ALSO EVEN THOSE WHO ARE COMMERCIAL AS WELL SO. CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EACH OF YOU ON THIS ISSUE. I AM VERY- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY AWARE AND X- EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT- THAT WAS PROPOSED BY SECRETARY GOLLY AND THAT I KNOW THAT WE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE HEARD AND HAS SUPPORTED IN THE STATE BUDGET. BUT SO I'M SURE THAT AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN SCHOOLS TO DO THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT MANY OF THESE CHILDREN A RAKE OUT ALSO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH. THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WHO THAT YOU KNOW DOES HAVE TRAINING AND- MANY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND BEING SURE THAT WE DON'T MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO LEVERAGE. THEIR CAPACITIES AS WELL AS- GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT BURDEN. ON MENTAL HEALTH IS- THE BASICALLY A LOT. HEALTH THAT THEY'RE BEING FACE BURCHILL. AND OF COURSE AFFECTING THEIR EDUCATION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR LEYVA ANSWERED NEWMAN FOR THE SAMPLING THIS UP PANEL IN THIS- ET TODAY IT'S IT COMES AT A AT A IMPORTANT TIME BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A DIFFICULT TIME. I APPRECIATED HEARING FROM OUR WONDERFUL SUPERINTENDENT IN MISTER GORDON MYSTERY NOVEL ABOUT- THE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE DIRECTING TO TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS AT. THIS ISSUE- I KNOW THAT- I- AND MY COLLEAGUES WHO WERE PLEASE TO PUT THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS REALLY A HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY. TO DAY IN RECOGNITION OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING IN OUR SCHOOLS AND WITH OUR KIDS. BUT THE- THE QUESTION THAT THAT IS ON MY MIND AND I IF THERE'S A POTENTIAL RESPONSE I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT. IS IT HOW DO WE- HOW WE GOT A MEASURE- SUCCESS. HOW WE CAN MEASURE PROGRESS. HOW WE GONNA MEASURE WHAT KIND OF AN ONGOING PROBLEM THIS REALLY- IS. NOT FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE THAT MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT POLICY AND BUDGET IN THIS SPACE WE WANT TO MAKE GOOD CHOICES. AND SO AS YOU ARE ADVANCING THESE IMPORTANT INITIATIVES TO HELP OUR KIDS. AND OUR STAFF. DURING THESE DIFFICULT TIMES HOW IS IT THAT. YOU ARE GOING TO MEASURE AND YOU CAN REPORT BACK TO US ON WHAT REALLY. HAS BEEN THE EFFECT OF THOSE INVESTMENTS SO THAT WE KNOW HOW WE CAN AS POLICY MAKERS MAKE GOOD CHOICES GOING FORWARD. ALL RIGHT MA'AM. MANY OF OUR PANELISTS WANT TO TAKE A STAB AT THAT. YES I'M HAPPY I'M HAPPY TO. LATE IN THE DAY AND THEN I'LL LET THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. CHARLIE OFFICE WITHIN MR BOARD TAKE CARE I LOVE THE QUESTION ARE CENTERED MAJOR AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH PROSTATE ACTUALLY AS- AS I WORK WITH THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT WE LEAD OUR TWENTY EIGHT STATES AROUND THIS CONVERSATION. ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND NATIONALLY WERE GRAPPLING WITH THIS ABOUT HOW DO WE MEASURE THE- THE QUALITY OF INVESTMENTS RELATED TO S. E. L. WE ARE TACKLING THAT NURSE IN OUR GEO LEAD CONVERSATIONS IN OUR STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN MEASURE PROGRESS. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE NATIONALLY ABOUT HOW WE DO THAT- D. REACTIONS FOR ELLIE GAYS IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC SPIN TO REACT TO THE PANDEMIC IN THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS BY IMMEDIATELY TRYING TO ASSOCIATE SOME TYPE OF SCREENER. TO ASSESS WHETHER SQUARE STUDENTS FALL ON A CONTINUUM OF SUPPORTS A NATIONAL YOU HAVE A LOT OF DEBATES AROUND THAT I THINK BUT OUR EFFORTS. WILL BE TO- AT THE TIME. WERE OURS. ACROSS STATE. IT'S TOO BAD- IDENTIFY HOW WE CAN DO THIS MORE EFFECTIVELY SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. FOR YOU THE NEEDED INFORMATION THAT YOU REQUIRE. NOW AND THAT WE REQUIRE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INVESTMENTS SO MY SHORT ANSWER IS- WE NEED TO WORK ON THIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS NATIONAL ACROSS THE STATE I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS THIS. ASSISTING CANCER AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING IT BACK TO YOU. HOW THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE COME OUT BUT WE'VE DEVELOPED AS A RESULT. IF I COULD THANK YOU I WOULD JUST ADD TO- MR NAVAJOS- RESPONSE I THINK THAT. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE- A WAY TO MEASURE A STUDENT- SUCCESS AND SCHOOL SUCCESS AND THAT CAN BE THROUGH SCHOOL CLIMATE. THAT CAN HAVE THERE COULD BE MEASURES THAT WE CAN USE TO MEASURE. INDIVIDUAL STUDENT- SUCCESS AND HOW- YOU KNOW CAN WE SEE A REDUCTION. IN CRISES AND CRISES HOSPITALIZATIONS- AND I'M GATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR WORK IN THE BUDGET. TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WITH AT LEAST A HALF A DOZEN STAFF IN THE SPACE OF MENTAL HEALTH. THAT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN TO WORK WITH ACTS- IN SUCCESS- AND ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS TO BUILD A NETWORK FOR HOW WE TOLD STORIES. OF SUCCESS FOR OUR ENTIRE. DISTRICT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S LOCAL CONTROL INDIVIDUALS WILL USE VARIOUS TYPES OF. WAYS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WE LIKE TO BUILD THE PICTURE- IN BUILD THE METRICS. FOR MEASURING SUCCESS- STATE WIDE THE END PRIOR TO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD ONLY ONE. PERSON WITH A JOB TITLE THAT WAS FOCUSED ON MENTAL HEALTH AND I GOT TO GET A GREAT SHOT OUT- TO MONICA. ANNAPOLIS SAME- WHO'S BEEN HELPING TO STEER SO MANY TRAININGS. YOUR MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID IN OTHERS NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY CREATE. INTEGRATED COMPREHENSIVE WAY OF MEASURING AND I WANT TO SAY AN EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF THIS WILL BE A CHALLENGE. FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED. EVEN THOUGH THE INVESTMENT IS SO ROBUST FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE NATURE OF ONE TIME DOLLARS THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT- HIRING POSITIONS. THAT MAY HAVE TO GO AWAY IN A FEW YEARS AND IT'S NOT JUST. THE MENTAL HEALTH BY THE WAY- I NUMBERS PUTTING THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE I IT NOW. IT'S AN OPPORTUNE FOR US TO BE MORE NOW GET OUR OUR- AROUND HOW WE DRESS THAT WE HAVE ALL THE RIGHT EXPERTS ON THIS PANEL AND MANY MANY OTHERS. WHO CAN HELP US THINK THAT THROUGH BUT WE DO SEE THE OPPORTUNITY CREATED KIND OF INTEGRATED COORDINATED WAY TO MEASURE STUDENT SUCCESS GOING FORWARD AND- FOREST DR DANIEL LEE- WHO HEADS UP OUR EQUITY- UNIT AT OUR EQUITY BRANCH OF THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WHOSE- LICENSE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS AND- A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST WILL BE HELPING US. TO STEER THAT STATEWIDE CONVERSATION ABOUT MEASURING- THE IMPACT MENTAL HEALTH THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I ALSO SAY SENATOR LATER THANK YOU FOR THE WORK WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING YOUR- OUR PRODUCTS FOR PARTNER WITH YOU ON- TO RAISE AWARENESS AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND WE CERTAINLY WOULD BE EAGER TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT- IN SUBSEQUENT- LEGISLATIVE FIVE. YEARS OLD. IN CENTER. IF I JUST. AND ONCE POINT I THINK AS WE WORK TO BRING OUR HEALTH SYSTEMS AND OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS. MORTON ALIGNMENT IT'S ABOUT ACCESS MAKING SURE ALL OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS. TO CARE BUT MOST OF ALL THAT WE FOCUS. AS MUCH ON PREVENTION AS WE DO ON CARE SO THAT WE CAN AVOID. THE THINGS THAT WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE SO THAT MEANS ALSO MOVING INTO THE ZERO TO FIVE SPACE WALKS AS WE RAMP UP. A TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IN OUR IN OUR PRESCHOOLS. THE MORE WE CAN LOAD IN PREVENTIVE SERVICES THE MORE. WE WILL AVOID MORE SERIOUS. YOUR BUT DEAL WITH MAJOR ON IT'S- I WANT THANK EACH THEM FOR THEIR ANSWERS I APPRECIATE EACH OF YOU THE LEADERSHIP THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING ONE UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANT PINT THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT MADE A MOMENT AGO WE KNOW THIS IS NOT A ONE TIME- ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING ONE. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND WAYS TO TRY TO MEASURE THE GREAT WORK THAT IS GOING TO BE DONE AND WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME SENSE OF PROGRESS POINTS OR NOT IN ORDER FOR US TO DO OUR BEST WORK AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE RESOURCES FOR THIS ON GOING TO AN IMPORTANT EFFORT THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER SENATOR DOLLY THE ONLY FRIEND SHE WAS AT LEAST GET A REMIND PEOPLE AGAIN IF YOU ARE CALLING IN MAKE SURE YOU WERE ON YOU WE ARE GETTING SOMEONE'S CONVERSATION CENTERED ALI THANK YOU THE CO CHAIRS. AND I ALSO LIKE TO JUST GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO THE PANELIST I WANTED TO MR THURMAN BEEN ON MANY- ZOOM MEETINGS WITH MANY OF- MY COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT AND I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST WANT TO. START OFF BY SAYING AS A FATHER- THEY HAVE TWO SONS IN HIGHER ED AND A DAUGHTER IN IN- IN MIDDLE SCHOOL- IT'S BEEN A VERY. DIFFERENT DIFFERENT- YEAR OBVIOUSLY I ACTUALLY SPONSORED LEGISLATION TO GIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR MENTAL HEALTH FOR. SCHOOLS AND- MR FORTINOS BILL WAS THE LEAD BILL THAT CAME OUT BUT I WAS HAPPY TO SUPPORT THAT- SO I WANTED TO SHARE I THINK ONE OF THE- THE- THERE'S NO LACK OF RESOURCES. WE HAVE TONS OF RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW AND IT AND IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO IT- EXPEND THOSE RESOURCES BUT I THINK. A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT TO. LOOK AT HERE IS. A BIT AVAILABILITY OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO THE WORK- REPRESENTING VERY RULE DISTRICTS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND GETTING THE MONEY OUT AND ACTUALLY FINDING THE CLINICIANS- I'D LIKE TO MAYBE TOUCH ON THAT A LITTLE BIT AND THEN I WAS WONDERING AFTER YOU KNOW THIS MANY. MONTHS OF BEING IN THE PANDEMIC. ONE OF THE THINGS I OBSERVED AS A PARENT AND ALSO LISTENING TO MY- DISTRICTS IS CONSISTENCY IN LIKE POLICY SO I THINK- SENATOR GLAZER KIND OF TOUCHED ON THAT A LITTLE BIT LIKE. YOU KNOW HOW TO MEASURE WHAT WHAT WE SEE AS FAR AS- MOVING FORWARD SO. IF YOU COULD TOUCH ON THOSE- AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION WOULD BE. HOW DO YOU SEE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE VERY RULE SO THOSE ARE THE THREE. KIND OF TOP QUESTIONS I HAD. HELLO THE PANELISTS DECIDE WHO GOES FIRST THERE ARE. DOLLY I GET OUTSIDE RIGHT I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN NORMAL AREAS THAT OUR FAMILIES ARE DEALING WITH MANY THINGS IN ADDITION TO COVERAGE WE'RE ALSO DEALING WITH FIRES AND JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE HERE THAT WE'VE HAD WHOLE COMMUNITIES DESTROYED SCHOOLS LOSS AND LOSS OF LOVED ONES AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS IN ADDITION TO CALL BUT WE HAVE TO. PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SUPPORTS FOR FAMILIES IMPACTED BY A NATURAL DISASTER- YEAH AND YOU'RE RIGHT THE WORK FORCE HAS BEEN IMPACTED YOU MENTIONED COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS ARE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE IN STANDING UP WAYS TO- TO GROW THE WORKFORCE IN SUPER JENNA GORDON TALKED ABOUT IT. YEAH AND- YOU KNOW OUR SOLANO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT DR HEARING JAN- HAS- I'M SORRY CINEMA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT DR HEARING CAN HAS OUT OF EXPERIENCE IN THE SESAME BUILT A WAY TO HELP GET MORE COUNSELORS AREAS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'VE BEEN IMPACTED BY A NATURAL DISASTER AND WE HAVE TO LEARN FROM THAT AND BUILD FROM THAT. AND BUILD THE WORKFORCE PROGRAM SET SO THEY HELP US GET MORE CLINICIANS IN THE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE FEWER ACCESS POINTS- TO HEALTH CARE AND TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SO WE'RE COMMITTED. YOU KNOW THIS IS ALSO AN ISSUE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN TERMS OF WE HAVE TEACHER SHORTAGES WE HAVE SO MANY SUPERINTENDENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WERE RTIRING THE FATIGUE LEVEL OF EDUCATORS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IS SO SIGNIFICANT THAT PART OF OUR CALCULUS IN THIS MOMENT HAS TO BE ABOUT HOW WE SUPPORT OUR EXISTING CLINICIANS AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR- FROM A GREAT ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS AND COUNSELORS ARE. LATER TODAY- I WON'T I WON'T TAKE AWAY THEIR POINTS BUT WE HAVE GREAT ASSOCIATIONS FOR CLINICIANS WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM WE HAVE SUPPORT NOW IN TERMS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE IN GRADUATE PROGRAMS TO BECOME CLINICIANS AND REALLY PUT THE INCENTIVES IN PLACE TO HELP TEM- NOT ONLY BECOME CLINICIANS BUT ALSO TO I'M TO SOME OF THE COMMUTE. THAT HAVE THE HIGHER. NEEDS IN OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TO WORK YOU SENATOR DOLLY ON WAYS THAT WE CAN BE SUPPORTIVE I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF OUR FAMILIES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. BY THESE FIRES- AND THANK ALL OF OUR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS WERE HELPING THEM. WE'VE ALSO RAISE MONEY TO SUPPORT. THOSE FAMILIES THAT NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND SUPPORT AND- WE STAND COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THESE PANELISTS AND- WITH OUR OUR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS AND OTHER LEADERS. ON HOW WE GROW OUR WORK FORCE TO HAVE MORE CLINICIANS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. COULD I JUST BE VERY. DIRECT THE- ARE YOU HAVEN'T SO IT EVERY BUSINESS THAT I KNOW INCLUDING MY OWN IS HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING PEOPLE TO WORK AND SO ARE WE ARE YOU HAVING ITS DIRECTION ALREADY GE OF. FILLING THESE POSITIONS. ARE THEY AVAILABLE ARE THE PEOPLE AVAILABLE. TO YOUR QUESTION CENTER I THINK THAT IN AREAS THAT HAVE HAD. TO HAVE HEALTH CARE AND DON'T HAVE A LOT OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WE HAVE SEEN HISTORICALLY. THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES AND- BEFORE THE END OF THIS HEARING I CAN GET YOU ANY STATISTIC THAT'S AVAILABLE ABOUT SHORTAGES AROUND MENTAL HEALTH I THINK SUPERINTENDENT BORDEN ALLUDED TO IT IN HIS OPENING REMARKS- BUT WE HAVE FOUND THAT- OUR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS HAVE REALLY BEEN CREATIVE. IN COMING UP WITH SOME- I WOULD SAY SHORT TERM MEASURES AND LONG TERM MEASURES TO ADDRESS SHORTAGES AND I WOULD JUST MENTION- FRESNO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE. HAS YOU KNOW BEEN ABLE TO FILL HUNDREDS OF COUNSELING POSITIONS- IN RECENT TIMES AND SO THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF PLACES WHERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MEET THE NEED BUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE. THAT THIS SECTOR LIKE EVERY OTHER SECTOR IN OUR WORK FORCE WILL BE IMPACTED IT WILL NEED TO DO PLANNING AND STRATEGIZING NOW. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM NEEDS AND TO BUILD A LONG TERM WORKFORCE THAT WE WILL NEED GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR THE DIRECTION TO CO ANSWER I APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW IT'S A CHALLENGE AND- I'LL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING. YOU KNOW. I WANT TO JUST GIVE ME THE REST OF THE MEMBERS AND- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ARE FACED IN RURAL AREAS IF YOU'RE IN HAPPY CAMP WHICH IS. TYPICALLY IS ON THE% KLAMATH RIVER IT'S IN MY DISTRICT. IT'S NATIVE AMERICAN HIGHEST SUICIDE RATE OF YOUNG MAN IS NATIVE AMERICAN NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. TO GET THERE IS IT FROM PACIFIC YEW FROM CITY COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IS ABOUT A TWO AND A HALF HOUR TRIP SO IF YOU IF YOU SEND YOUR CLINICIAN OUT TO OBSERVE. THEIR FIVE HOURS ON THE ROAD EACH WAY BEFORE THEY EVEN GET TO OBSERVE THE STUDENTS AND SO THOSE ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACED WITH. THROUGHOUT THE NORTHEASTERN CALVARY I KNOW THE SENATOR MCGUIRE'S DISTRICT AS WELL AND SO THOSE ARE THE CHALLENGES AND FAST BE ABLE TO FIND THOSE FOLKS. TO START WITH SO APPRECIATE- THOSE COMMENTS AND I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR SUPERINTENDENTS. IN OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS AND YOU ALL AS WELL AS TRYING TO FIND THOSE FOLKS. TO GET OUT THERE AND ACTUALLY DO THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO- DESPERATELY FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I'M I WANT I WANT TO THINK THE SUPERINTENDENT AND MR GORDON AND MR NAVO- FOR THIS PANEL AND- AS WELL FOR CHAIRMAN FOR PUTTING THIS ON- ALONG WITH YOU- I HAVE A QUESTION AS IT PERTAINS AND THIS MAY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO READY SO FORGIVE ME IF IT HAS BEEN BUT AS IT PERTAINS TO RECRUIT THE RECRUITMENT OF. MENTAL HEALTH- SOCIAL WORKERS COUNSELORS WHO ARE- MULTI LINGUAL IMMIGRATION COMPETENCE- THAT CAN CERTAINLY WORK WITH STUDENTS OF COLOR ESPECIALLY IN THIS THIS AGE WHERE WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS OF COLOR BIN YOU KNOW HAD A LOT MORE CHALLENGES WITH- THIS PANDEMIC- CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT AND HOW WE'RE DOING WITH RECRUITMENT OR WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN SOME OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO GET A BETTER IDEA. AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION TO BUILD OFF OF THAT PLEASE. I YOU KNOW IF I COULD CENTER IS ALL THANKS TO THE QUESTION I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS OUR SYSTEM HAS TO DO BETTER- JUST LIKE. HOW WE HAVE TO DIVERSIFY OUR OUR OUR EDUCATED WORKFORCE- WE HAVE TO DIVERSIFY OUR OUR CLINICAL WORK FORCE BUT- AGAIN I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TOWSON COALITION THAT OUR OFFICE IS PUT TOGETHER. THAT BRINGS TOGETHER A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST- SOCIAL WORKERS- MF FEES- BRINGS TOGETHER. EVERYONE WHO WORKS IN A CLINICAL SPACE AND WE'VE MADE THAT OUR TOP PRIORITY HOW DO WE DIVERSIFY. THOSE WHO ARE. ABLE TO PROVIDE- CLINICAL SUPPORT TO OUR STUDENTS I WOULD SAY I WOULD DESCRIBE AS A AS A NEED IN A WORK IN PROGRESS- BUT WE ARE WILLING TO WORK CLOSELY WITH YOU SENATOR AND OTHERS- ON THIS ET AS WE CONTINUE TO. MOVE FORWARD AND- AS I'M REMINDED THERE ARE MANY EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY THE TYPES OF PROVIDERS WHO CAN BE HELPFUL AND THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO. WILL HAVE LICENSED PROVIDERS IN SOME CASES WILL HAVE PRACTITIONERS- WHO MAY BE AT THE BACHELOR LEVEL OR WHO APPEAR- LEVELS AND THAT THEY'LL BE WASTING INTEGRATE MORE FOLKS AND I BELIEVE THIS WILL ALSO ALLOW US. TO DO A BETTER JOB OF DIVERSIFYING- THE COUNCIL WORKFORCE. THE ANSWER AND SAID LET LET ME JUST ADD THAT I THINK. IN THE END WE ALSO HAVE TO WORK MUCH HARDER TO GROW OUR OWN WE HAVE OUR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING LOCALLY. TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO INTEREST YOUNG PEOPLE IN GOING INTO THESE FIELDS BUT MORE THAN THAT. TO PROVIDE THEM SUPPORT AS THEY NAVIGATE THROUGH GOING THROUGH- A COMMUNITY COLLEGE INTO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE INTO THE LICENSING PROGRAMS THEY WILL NEED SUPPORT THEY WILL NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT. IN THE FORM OF JOBS AND INTERNSHIPS AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT IF WE ORGANIZE IF WE ORGANIZED THE SYSTEM AND APPRENTICESHIPS. IN THOSE SORTS OF AVENUES I THINK I THINK WE CAN GET IT DONE IF WE'RE IF WE'RE FOCUSED AND JOB. WE'VE GOT SOME INITIAL SUCCESS SO FAR. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER AND I HAVE ONE MORE QESTION IT JUST A PERTAINS TO KIND OF BUILDING OFF OF THAT YOU KNOW IN IN LONG BEACH THAT I REPRESENT A VERY DIVERSE I'VE GOT ONE OF THE LARGEST. I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE CAMBODIAN COMMUNITIES AND SO AND LIKE TO KNOW- THE EFFORTS TO DISAGGREGATE THE DATA FOR API COMMUNITY BECAUSE- FOR THE CAMBODIAN COMMUNITY THEY'RE VERY UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND IN WHICH- ANOTHER CONSTANTLY ASKING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT NOT ONLY FOR STUDENTS BUT FOR THEIR- PARENTS. BUT THIS IS WHERE THE IMMIGRATION REFUGEE COMPENSATES COMPETENCY THE CULTURAL COMPETENCE COMES IN TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM. SO I'M WONDERING- HOW WE ARE. THAT IF OUR EFFORTS TO DISAGGREGATE THE DATA IS OUR SUCCESSFUL AND HOW WE'RE SORT OF LOOKING AT THE API COMMUNITY IN THAT IN THAT SENSE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM THE- CUSTOMIZABLE AT THAT THEY NEED. WHO WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A STAB AT THAT- I'LL I'LL TAKE IT AND JUST SAY THAT- YOU KNOW I'M GONNA BE ASKING MY TEAM TO HELP US COME UP WITH SOME- A FEW STATISTICS THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU. BEFORE THE END OF THIS HEARING- JUST KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL EFFORTS TO FOCUS ON DISAGGREGATED DATA IN EDUCATION THEY HAVEN'T ALL BEEN MENTAL HEALTH SPECIFIC- BUT THERE ARE SOME- THERE ARE SOME MENTAL HEALTH COALITIONS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON. A RACIAL AND ETHNIC JUSTICE AND THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE COALITION ON THAT WE WORK WITH IN SACRAMENTO- THAT DOES THIS WORK IT WILL HELP US I THINK THROUGH- YOU KNOW HOW WE JUST AGGREGATE THE DATA. AND THEN IN GENERAL SENATOR I THINK IT YOU'RE POINTING TO WE NEED MORE CULTURALLY COMPETENT- WAYS TO DELIVER- MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS IN THE WAY MENTAL HEALTH IS DELIVERED HAS TO BE VERY DIFFERENT- FOR MANY COMMUNITIES AND- I KNOW THAT- YOU'VE GOT GREAT PANELS HERE IN ALICE RISCO AND DOCTOR WOULD SOON WHO. WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK ON SOME OF THIS WITH MORE DETAIL BUT OUR OFFICE WILL WORK TO GET A FEW MORE POINTS SO WE CAN SHARE BEFORE THE CONCLUSION OF THIS YEAR. THANK YOU SUPERINTENDENT I APPRECIATE IT LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU. AND SAYING WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THANK YOU FOR RAISING THE ISSUE. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALES WE'RE GONNA GO TO SENATOR CORTESE THEN SENATOR ROSS. TURNER CORTESE. THANK YOU VENTURE- THE MISSISSIPPI ATTENDED- IT INTO EVEN ANSWERING A SIMILAR QUESTION TO WHAT I'M GOING TO ASK IN IN IN VARIOUS WAYS HERE BUT- ON THE VERY VERY POSITIVE SIDE. AND I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF THIS GIVEN YOUR- BUT GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU SAID IN YOUR- EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL WITH THE COUNTY OFFICES ON THE COUNTY OFFICE IN. WELCOME VALUES IN KERR COUNTY- RECENT RECEIVED ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN MH SSA FUNDS AND THEY'VE GOT ABOUT ANOTHER SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY'RE ANTICIPATING THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS WHICH PUTS. ELEVEN WELLNESS CENTERS IN ELEVEN. UNIQUE DISTRICTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THIRTY ONE DISTRICTS DOWN THERE- FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY. THE QUESTION- ALL MY MIND IS. WITH TWO FOLD ONE WHO WILL BE MONITORING- THE READY NESS FOR ADDITIONAL DOLLARS- ALL OF THAT THE QUESTION COURSE ANTICIPATES THAT THERE WILL BE A WAY AT SOME POINT TO. CONTINUE TO GROW AND AUGMENT. THE SUFFERED- EVEN INCLUDING IT IN THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE. BUT WHO WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. GIVEN WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE KIND THE QUALITY OF DATA THAT YOU'RE GETTING IN THE QUALITY OF COMMUNICATION THAT YOU HAVE. WITH THE VARIOUS COUNTY OFFICES- THAT YOU'RE IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO. INFORM THE NEED FOR THE READING OF THE READINESS AND THE NEED. FOR ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO SUPPORT GROWTH AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MY COLLEAGUES WHO TALKED. IF T. IAN STAFFING IN. A QUALIFIED PERSONAL CRITICAL PERSONNEL. BUT SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE- COUNTY'S COUNTY OFFICES INCLUDING. THE ONE IN MY DISTRICT THAT REPRESENTS THAT AREA. THEY'RE READY NOW TO KEEP GROWING IN IN IN SO THE SECOND PART OF MY QUESTION IS BESIDES WHO WHO WILL BE MONITORING THAT INFORMING. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH- IS IT. IS IT IS IT LIKELY OR ISIT ALREADY PART OF THE SYSTEM THAT THOSE WHO WERE- READY COMMAND WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO GO REGARDLESS OF YOU KNOW THE TYPICAL- GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD HAVE IN THAT I CERTAINLY VALUE- THIS SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE- GIVEN. THE GRAVITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES- WE NEED TO BE KEEP FEEDING AND FUELING- HERE THE INTERVENTION- KIND OF WORK THAT'S GOING ON IT WHICH IS SO OFTEN A LIFE AND DEATH PROPOSITION AMONG OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND AND SO I GUESS MY OPINION IS THAT WE SHOULD BE. WE SHOULD BE- YOU KNOW AGAIN FUNDING IN FUELING WITH INVESTMENT DOLLARS- THE GROWTH OF FOR THOSE WHO PERHAPS HAD A HEAD START WHO ALREADY HAD SOME INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE BUT- BUT ARE READY TO KEEP GROWING AND KEEP PROTECTING YOUNG PEOPLE WHO JUST LIKE YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT AND REALLY TO EDUCATE ME ON ON HOW THAT SYSTEM WILL WORK GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF. WHAT THE WHAT THE OVERRIDING CRITERIA IS GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY OR THOSE WHO ARE READY TO GO GO NOW. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION CENTER AND- IT'S COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT BUT I'M GONNA SPEAK PLAIN AND TELL YOU SOME PLACES WHERE I THINK THERE'S GOOD OPPORTUNITY AND WHETHER SOME CHALLENGES HAT WE NEED TO MANAGE AND STRATEGIZE BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT BONDS I REMIND FULL OF THE FACT THAT- THOSE GREAT PROGRAMS. GREW OUT OF YOUR CHAMBER GREW OUT OF THE SENATE- AND- CONTINUE TO LIVE ON WITH US- BUT THEY HAD BEEN- YOU KNOW PRIOR TO NOW BOTTLENECKS FOR SOME COUNTIES AND IT'S BEEN HARD TO MOVE THOSE DOLLARS- IT'S BEEN HARD TO MOVE SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS THE COMMUNITY PRIOR TO THE END AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING. GREAT MOVEMENT NOW AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIS MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS THEIR FOCUS ON SCHOOLS BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY THAT STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH YEAH WE HAVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ALLIANCE IN EVERY COUNTY HAS A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. ORGANIZATION WE NEED TO PARTNER WITH THEM SO GRADE AND- BLAND TOGETHER EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR- THAT'S AVAILABLE BECAUSE AS I POINTED OUT A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS ONE TIME MONEY YEAH AND I THINK WE'LL GO I THINK WE'LL BUILD STRONG SYSTEMS BUT WE MAY ONLY GET A LIFT FOR FEW YEARS UNLESS YOU BUILD THE RIGHT KIND OF SYSTEM. THAT CARRIES US BEYOND THE INITIAL THREE OR FOUR YEAR- THAT I THINK THESE DOLLARS CAN PROVIDE INVESTMENT FOR I WOULD SAY THAT EVERY COUNTY IS READY TO RECEIVE THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OUR OFFICE WILL WORK WITH EACH OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY OFFICES AND EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT TO RECEIVE THEIR AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT THEY SHOULD BE RECEIVING ACCORDING. TO YOU KNOW FORMAL- YOU KNOW LOCAL CONTROL FORMULA L. LOKS COOL FUNDING FORMULA AND SO- THERE ARE SOME ABILITIES TO MONITOR THAT SPENDING BUT I'M GONNA BE FRANK WITH YOU SENATOR MANY DISTRICTS HAVE SAID THAT NOT JUST IN RELATION TO MENTAL HEALTH. BUT IN TERMS OF ALL THE DOLLARS COMING THEIR WAY. SOME DISTRICTS HAVE SAID THEY'RE NOT SURE- EXACTLY HOW DO YOU LOOK. SOME OF THESE DUMB. A GROUP A GREAT DEAL OF THAT IS OUT OF CONCERN ABOUT THE ONE TIME NATURE. OF THE MONEY WE ACTUALLY PUT ON. A WE HAVE TO PUT ON A TRAINING JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WE INVITED EVERY DISTRICT IN THE STATE TO PARTICIPATE IN. WHERE THE FOCUS WAS ON HOW TO UTILIZE SOME OF THESE NEW STATE DOLLARS AND WE BROUGHT ON SEVERAL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BUILT MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS SO THEY CAN BE SPOTLIGHTS- FOR OTHERS THAT ARE BEGINNING. TO BUILD THEM WE HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE TO LIST- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH HAS A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR SCHOOLS EITHER A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST OR SOCIAL WORKER. OR SOMEONE WITH A CLINICAL BACKGROUND THAT IS NOT TYPICAL FOR ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. AND BUT WE WANT TO BUILD THAT KIND OF A SYSTEM AND SO- THE DOLLARS WILL BE MOVING. THE FOCUS WILL HAVE TO BE ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING. OUR OFFICE WILL BE ONE OF THE STANDS TO HELP AND TO DO THAT OBVIOUSLY THE MENTAL HEALTH. ADVISORY AND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WILL HELP WITH THAT AND THEN OF COURSE THE ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. DEPARTMENT THE STATE'S HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT WILL HELP YOU BUILD THAT WE ARE WE ARE HAVING TO BUILD A SYSTEM. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SYNCHRONIZE IN TRIAGE SO TO SPEAK. WITH OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS- ONE TO FIGURE OUT EVERY DOLLAR- HOW THEY GET MAXIMIZE. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE SYSTEMS ARE INTEGRATED AND HOW THEY'RE MOVING FORWARD. WHAT WHAT WILL HELP IS THAT THE STATE HAS MADE THREE BILLION AVAILABLE FOR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS SO IT'LL BE WRAP AROUND SUPPORTS. IN SCHOOLS HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE AROUND USING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. AND SOME HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH MENTAL HEALTH BUT MANY DO NOT HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH MEDICARE NOW IN MANY DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THE QUESTION. AROUND THE RECRUITMENT AND THERE IS NO SINGLE AGENCY WHAT'S UP THAT IS THE POINT OF RESPONSIBILITY. FOR BUILDING THAT WORK FORCE BUT IT WILL BE UP TO. SO IN MY- AND I TEAM AT THE- OF EDUCATION SUPERINTENDENT GORDON AND MR NAVAJO AND THE FOLKS AT THE MAIN OFFICE OVERSTEP BY THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE ALL OF US. TO PULL TOGETHER OUR PARTNERS. HOW TO BUILD THE SYSTEM- THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF FOR HOW WE DO THIS- BUT THE DOLLARS ARE MOVING NOW- TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS- WILL BE PROVIDING TRAINING ON HOW AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. ON HOW TO DO COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND I WILL BE WORKING WITH ALL THOSE PARTNERS THE POOL TOGETHER THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- YOU KNOW AGENCIES- AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE SO WE CAN BUILD A SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM. FOR DOING THIS WORK. SENATOR LET LET ME LET ME JUST BUILD ON- SUPERINTENDENT GOVERNMENT'S REMARKS BECAUSE I THINK HE'S RIGHT I THINK HE'S RIGHT ON TARGET- THE STATE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WILL BE INVOLVED IN WORKING ON MAJOR INITIATIVES TO WORK WITH THE MANAGED CARE PROVIDERS. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER INITIATIVES AT THE STATE LEVEL FROM THE FUNDING YOU APPROPRIATELY. OUR SYSTEM IS VERY VERY COMPLICATED AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE DID. WAS AUTHORIZED THE- MHS ALWAYS SEE TO MAKE SURE EVERY SINGLE COUNTY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR- ROBOTS SCHOOL COUNTY PARTNERSHIP. BECAUSE THOSE PARTNERSHIPS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. ARE THE KEY TO HELPING THE FARMS FLOW SMOOTHLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT ALSO TO DEAL WITH THE QUESTION. OF SUSTAINABILITY WHICH WORRIES SCHOOL PEOPLE SO MUCH SO I THINK THAT WILL THAT WILL COME INTO PLACE AND THAT WILL BE A GREAT HELP. BECAUSE I THINK THE COUNTIES THAT. ARE BLESSED TO HAVE RIGHT NOW STRONG LIKE LIKE IN OUR COUNTY STRONG LOCAL SCHOOL. COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS ARE MUCH BETTER ABLE TO MOVE MONEY AND- AND INNOVATE. USING THE EXISTING RESEARCH COURSES AND DEVELOP THE. DIVORCE EXPANDABLE RESOURCES. THANK YOU FOR THE CHAIR OF MAJOR. FOR WEAPONS JUST- I PRE VERY THE THOROUGHNESS OF THE RESPONSES- AND- YOU KNOW IN IN. THE I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH SO SUPERINTENDENTS. USE OF TOOL THIS IS AN EXAMPLE I DO REPRESENT I DO NOT REPRESENT THAT AREA BUT- WHEN I WAS TRYING TO SAY IS I REPRESENT AN AREA. OF SIMILAR CAPACITY- AN AREA WHERE. THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PROGRAM WHICH IS CALLED SCHOOLING SERVICES GOES BACK- IN ITS FIRST ITERATION ALL THE WAY TO AND PETE WILSON WAS GOVERNOR THAT'S HOW LONG THE PROGRAMS IN PLACE. SO MY CONCERN IS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE FROM A AN APPROPRIATION STANDPOINT. THE PERHAPS A LEGISLATIVE STANDPOINT PERHAPS IT'S JUST. A LEGISLATIVE BUDGETARY STANDPOINT COMING INTO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THAT WE- MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INCREASING FUNDING TO THE CHULA VISTA AS- IN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTIES OF THE WORLD WHO HAD THE SIMPLE STRUCTURE IN PLACE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE CERTAINTY IN THE CAPACITY. TO MAKE THOSE COMMITMENTS TO CONTINUE GROWING THEIR PROGRAM. BUT WHILE WE ARE PATIENTLY WORKING WITH THE DISTRICTS THAT AREN'T READY- YOU KNOW ONGOING TRAINING AND GETTING THEM. TO STAND UP THEIR PROGRAMS I DON'T WANT THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE TRYING TO STAND UP SLOW DOWN THE FLOW OF MONEY COMING IN. FOR THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN READY. FOR A LONG TIME TO CONTINUE GROWING SO- SHEET AGAIN- ABOUT ASKING FOR IT. RESPONSE BUT- I GUESS SOME KIND OF TELEGRAPHING WHAT I EXPECT TO BE. ADVOCATING FOR- YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD IN OUR OWN BUDGET PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE THAT'S WHY I SAY YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE- SUPERINTENDENT IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WHO IS VERY FOCUSED ON. YOU KNOW WHOLE CHILD SUPPORT'S WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT THERE WE UNDERSTAND AS WE'RE AS WE'RE EVEN IN THIS HEARING OUR TEAM HAS BEEN SENDING ME INFORMATION. THAT ONE OF THE NEEDS FOR A SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN GENERAL IS ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE AND SO WE WILL PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THAT NEED WORK CLOSELY WITH. YOUR OFFICE IN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION ON HOW WE MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S READY TO STAND UP- IN SENECA COUNTY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR% SUPERINTENDENT THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU- YOU KNOW I SKETCHED A LITTLE QUESTION AS MY COLLEAGUE WAS ASKING HIS I'LL PROBABLY ASK IT BUT I'LL I'LL PROBABLY DEVIATE FROM IT GIVEN THE RESPONSE AND I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE OR NOT. AND REALLY SHOULDN'T BE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FACILITIES YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO DO EDUCATING STUDENTS AND THERE ARE CERTAIN MENTAL HEALTH RELATED EDUCATIONAL ISSUES THAT OUR PROPOSAL APPROPRIATELY DEALT WITH ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT REALLY NEED TO BE TRIAGED AND DIVERTED TO OTHER TREATMENTS- RESOURCE IS MY QUESTION THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK AND I'LL ASK IT YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE A SPECIFIC INTER AGENCY PLANT A TREE- STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUES ON CAMPUS AND EFFICIENTLY STEER THOSE WITH MENTAL HEALTH RELATED EDUCATIONAL ISSUES TO SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND OTHER RELATED MENTAL HEALTH PERSONNEL ON CAMPUS AND THEN FOR THOSE WITH A MODERATE- MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES STEER THOSE TO OUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PROVIDERS TO THE EXTENT THAT'S APPROPRIATE AND THEN THOSE WITH THE MOST SERIOUS CASES TO THE COUNTIES. I'M I'M I GATHER WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC PLAN I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S REALLY A GOOD IDEA TO LEAVE IT UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND I'M WONDERING WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE I MEAN I WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT WE WOULD NEED TO. INVOLVE OUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE COULD ENTICE THEM ARE COMMERCIAL PROVIDERS. TO PERHAPS PLACE PERSONNEL IN DISTRICTS ARE CERTAINLY IN COUNTY OFFICES TO HELP. WITH THE TRIAGE EFFORT. TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE. STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT ENROLLED IN MEDICARE ALL WHO ARE APPROPRIATE RECIPIENTS ARE SO AND ROLLED IN TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY HAVE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE THAT PROVIDES MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE FOR THE MORE MODERATE. TO SEVERE CASES THAT WE GET THOSE STUDENTS. TO THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT PROVIDERS EFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVELY AND- AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO I I'D LIKE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. SUPERINTENDED TOUR OR THE OTHER PANELISTS. SENATOR RON THANKS FOR THE QUESTIONS THAT I START WERE YOU STARTED I AGREE WITH YOU SCHOOLS ARE NOT NECESSARILY MEANT TO BE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS- OUR SCHOOLS OUR TEACHERS AND OTHER STAFF THEY'RE THERE TO HELP SUPPORT THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. ABOUT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THOUGH IS THAT SCHOOLS CAN PLAY A KEY ROLE- IN BEING A PORTAL FOR HELPING STUDENTS TO GET SUPPORTED IN ONE OF THE TRAINING AS A GUEST PROVIDED FOR SCHOOLS IS A- A TRAINING CALLED NOW HEALTH FIRST AID. YEAH AND IT IS A TRAINING THAT ALLOWS EDUCATORS TO LEARN HOW TO RECOGNIZE SIGNS WHEN A REFERRAL NEEDS TO BE MADE OR STUDENT NEEDS TO BE CONNECTED TO A SOCIAL WORKER OR TO A COUNSELOR- AND SO THERE ARE WAYS TO DO THAT YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT- THAT WE HAVE TO BUILD OUT YOU KNOW THE RIGHT KINDS OF SYSTEMS. AND YOU KNOW OUT I CAN ONLY SPEAK ABOUT WHAT MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN I SPENT FIVE YEARS WORKING IN A SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATION THAT IS A PARTNER TO A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT MY EXPERIENCE WAS ONE. WHERE IT BURIED BY DISTRICT HOW REFERRALS GOT MADE AND WHAT SERVICES WERE IN PLACE AND SOME DID BETTER THAN OTHERS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT SO WE HAVE TO BUILD A KIND OF SYSTEM THAT RECOGNIZES- THAT HOW TO RECOGNIZE NEEDS AND HOW TO GET STUDENTS TO THE RIGHT LEVEL. OF CARE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THERE ARE SO MANY- SCHOOL BASED PARTNERS WHO SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS IN DOING THIS IN ADDITION TO OUR SCHOOL BASED STAFF AND A BIG SHOUT OUT TO ALL OF OUR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST OUR SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS ARE NURSES- ALL THE FOLKS WHO WORK DIRECTLY WITH OUR STUDENTS ARE BEHAVIORIST- YOU KNOW OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION STAFF. THEY DO INCREDIBLE WORK AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAVE TO BUILD THE SYSTEM THAT MAKES THE DELIVERY HAPPENED INCONSISTENT WAYS AND WE HAVE TO BUILD A SYSTEM THAT MAKES ALL OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS TALKTO EACH OTHER WORK. TOGETHER CLOSE TO A FAMILY IT'S SHOULD MATTER A FAMILY SHOULD GET PUSH AROUND INSTEAD- NO YOUR MEDIC OUT OR- NO YOU HAVE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE. TO THE FAMILY THAT YOU JUST KNOW WHAT DOOR I GO THROUGH TO GET WHAT I NEED YEAH WE DO HAVE WORKED TO BUILD OUT THOSE SYSTEMS AGAIN. SECRETARY GALLEY HAS OUTWEIGHED A VISION FOR HOW TO BUILD A SYSTEM THAT GETS PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE IS WORKING ALONGSIDE MEDI CAL. AND OUR OFFICE WILL I'M SURE AND ALONG WITH THE MICHAEL PANELISTS WILL ALL BE WORKING TOGETHER TO HELP. BUILD OUT THOSE SYSTEMS- TO MAKE SURE THAT- THERE'S A CLEAR DOOR TO GO THROUGH TO GET THE SERVICE THAT YOU NEED- WITHOUT ANYBODY HAVING TO. WORRY ABOUT LOSS WHO PAYS- BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO SOMEONE WHO HAS A NEED OUR KIDS ARE COMING BACK TO SCHOOL AND THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT KOBE. OR THEY'RE FEELING STRESSED FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD- LOST A LOVE ONE SOMEONE'S LOST A JOB- MAYBE EVEN HAD TO RELOCATE THEIR STRESS AND SO ALL WE WANT OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. AND OUR STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DO IS ACCESS THE RIGHT LEVEL OF CARE AND- SO WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO TO BUILD UP THAT SYSTEM BUT WE WILL FOLLOW YOUR DIRECTOR SENATOR. INTO WORKING TO BUILD THAT OUT. THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO. FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU AND THE REST ON THIS NEXT YEAR BUT THE ONE COMMON DENOMINATOR ACROSS OUR STATE AND ACROSS OUR- COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS. OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM. AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THAT'S THE ONE SYSTEM THAT WE DO HAVE A LITTLE CONTROL OVER. AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY HOW TO INCENTIVIZE OUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS ON BOTH SIDES. TO A PLACE WHETHER WHETHER WE CALL THEM NAVIGATORS ARE OTHER PERSONNEL ON OUR SCHOOL CAMPUSES. TO HELP STEER STUDENTS WHO ARE APPROPRIATELY. OF SHOULD BE OR ARE IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. THROUGH THAT MEDICAL SYSTEMS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT YOU AND- INDUCT KELLY AND THE REST PUT TOGETHER BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS AS THIS IS A CRITICAL. ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND ADDRESS NOW. THANK YOU SENATOR OFTEN IF YOU HAVE THE- TO HEAR FROM THE PALACE ALEX BRISCOE. I THINK HE'S ONE OF THE FOREMOST EXPERTS ON. MEDICARE HOW IN SCHOOL BASED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND SHE HELPED US PUT TOGETHER A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT ULTIMATELY BECAME- EMBEDDED IN STATE BUDGET. THAT TEACHES SCHOOL DISTRICTS HOW TO UTILIZE MEDICARE OUT YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE A IT IS IT'S A IT'S A IT'S AN EXPERIENCE IN A LANGUAGE UNTO ITSELF. TO KNOW HOW TO DO MEDICAL BILLING BUT IT IS A RELIABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR MEDICAL. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND IT IS YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW SENATOR IT IS A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT. THAT MEANS THAT MEANS THAT WHEN OUR STATE DOLLARS RUN LOW BECAUSE OF OUR ECONOMIC CHANGES DOWN THE ROAD. THE FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT CONTINUES TO BE AVAILABLE BUT CALIFORNIA HAS TO DRAW DOWN MORE OF IT WE- WE DRAW DOWN A SMALLER AMOUNT OF IT GIVEN OUR SIZE AND OUR- BRANCH. BUT IF WE FOLLOW THE PLANS OF PEOPLE LIKE ALEX CRISCO HAVE. IN OUR SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DOCTOR MARK GALLI I FORESEE THAT WE'RE GONNA MAXIMIZE MEDI CAL- AND THAT MEANS GREAT SERVICE FOR CALIFORNIA'S.

TWO IMPRESSIVE MASTERY OF THE ARCANE MECHANICS OF FEDERAL MEDICAID POLICY ADMINISTRATION. MR BRISCOE HAS BEEN A LONG TIME ADVOCATE FOR USING PUBLIC HEALTH AND EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS. AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT LINKAGES TO AFFECT BROADER TRANSFORMATIONS IN CHILD SERVING SYSTEMS WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR TO YOUR TESTIMONY AGAIN KEEPING IN MIND THE TIME DOCTOR COURTHOUSE- PLEASE KING THAT KICK THINGS OFF IT IS A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU HERE VIRTUALLY. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN AS SIGNED YOU INTRODUCED ME MY NAME IS DOCTOR DURING COURTHOUSE ON THE PEARL TO PRETEND TO HEAR HARBOR CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT. JUST WANT TO THANK ALL THE SENATORS WHO ASKED THE QUESTIONS- AND JUST APPRECIATE THAT THE THAT THE PANEL IS. HAS THE SUPERINTENDENT HERE BECAUSE THE IMPACT AND THE DECISIONS THAT YOU MAKE IN SACRAMENTO REGARDING THE- FUNDING AND WHAT IS BEST FOR KIDS DIRECTLY IMPACT US ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS- WE I'M VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A GREAT BOARD OF EDUCATION AND A COUNTY LEADER DR. A MORE CARS WHO WORKS WITH US TO TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN IN IN OUR DISTRICT. WE ARE LOW SOCIOECONOMIC DISTRICT. AND WE AS YOU KNOW WE SHUT DOWN ON MARCH THIRTEENTH THINKING THAT WE WERE GOING TO COME BACK TO EDUCATION. AND WE HAD TO SHIFT INTO EDUCATION VERY DIFFERENTLY WE WENT INTO A DISTANCE LEARNING AND WE STARTED SCHOOL IN OCTOBER WE BROUGHT OVER STUDENTS BACK IN A HYBRID MODEL. MANY OF OUR STUDENTS DECIDED TO STAY IN DISTANCE LEARNING. WE SHUT DOWN AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE HIGH POSITIVITY RATES IN LA HABRA. AND THEN WE BROUGHT OUR STUDENTS BACK IN FEBRUARY ONCE AGAIN IN A HYBRID MODEL- AND AS- YOU KNOW AS SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN HIT ON ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING WITH THE ANXIETY AND THE FEAR IN THE ANXIOUSNESS. WE DEAL WITH THAT EVERY EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT I HAVE TO TELL THE PANEL AND THE LISTENERS THAT. IF WE WOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE KIND OF. DONE WHAT WE HAD DONE DONE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AD ALSO AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD INTO THIS YEAR WE ARE BACK AND IN PERSON- FULL TIME WITH MASKS. AND THE MONEY THAT THAT- WE USED TO I JUST HAVE TO JUST GIVE YOU SOME SOLID EXAMPLES BECAUSE AS I SAID IT DEFINITELY IMPACTS US ON- YOU KNOW ON ON THE GROUND HERE IN THE DISTRICTS. WE USED. OUR BY OUR MONEY FOR THE- SUMMER SCHOOL ABBY OF. IN THE- ARE SCHOOL VERY LOW. ME HAD ABOUT TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS AND WE SIMPLY JUST HAD TO TARGET THE STUDENTS WITH THE LOWEST. LEVEL OF ACADEMICS AND THIS YEAR WE GET SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT WE INSTEAD OF HITTING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS WITH THAT MONEY. WE SPENT ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THREE WEEKS OF SUMMER SCHOOL BUT WE WERE ABLE TO IMPACT SIXTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND WE HAD THAT JOB WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT DOES ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS ALL NINE OF OUR SCHOOLS. AND THEN WE PARTNERED WITH THE CITY AND THEY BASICALLY BROUGHT THEIR EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO OUR SCHOOLS FOR US. WE WERE DOING- TAEKWONDO WE WERE DOING DANCE WE WERE DOING ALL OF THE RECREATION PROGRAMS THAT THE CITY THAT THE CITY IS DOING ON THERE- AT THE OTHER SUMMER PROGRAM. SO WE WERE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THAT AND WE ACTUALLY USE THE MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO THAT AGAIN NEXT YEAR. I WAS VERY PLEASED TO HEAR THE CONCERN THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THAT MONEY- AS WE'RE ON WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS FOR ADDITIONAL COUNSELORS. AND WE ARE DOING A- COMPASS PROGRAM IN OUR DISTRICT WHICH ALLOWS OUR STUDENTS IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. THEY HAVE CANNOT COUNSELING SERVICES TWICE A WEEK. IT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH AS WE TRANSITION INTO THAT YEAR BUT ALSO I USE THE WORD SCARY BECAUSE IT IS JUST WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER A MULTI YEAR BUDGET. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE BEING ABLE TO SPEND TAT. MONEY FOR COUNSELORS IN THE FUTURE IT'S SO SCARY TO THINK THAT WE ARE. EMPLOYING STAFF TO GATHER COUNCIL SIR. TO OUR STUDENTS AND KNOWING THAT WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE A SUSTAINABLE FOR NEXT YEAR. THE OTHER THING THAT WE ARE STILL GETTING ON WITH THAT MENTAL HEALTH PIECE OF IT IS THAT I'M A- FIRM BELIEVER IN PHYSICAL FITNESS WITH OUR STUDENTS- WE WERE GOING FROM- ONE TIME A WEEK WITH A WITH A P. E. TEACHER- AND THEIR TEACHERS WOULD. HANDLE THE PHYSICAL EDUCATION THE OTHER TIME- THE PART OF THE WEEK AND THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING WITH TWICE A TWICE A WEEK. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THE- LOOKING AT THAT USING THAT MONEY TO FUND THE PHYSICAL EDUCATION A PROGRAM BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT. THE THE BURDEN ON THE SCHOOLS ALSO WITH THE- WITH IT BUT THE TESTING AND THAT AND THE CODE RELATED ISSUES HAVE BEEN- ASTRID I HAVE JUST BEEN HUGE. WE HAVE HAD TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOURS AND ADDITIONAL STAFF. IN OUR SCHOOL OFFICES JUST TO MANAGE THE CONTACT TRACING AND THE- ADDITIONAL WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THE FAMILIES THE SPECIFIC CON AT THE SPECIFIC PHONE CALLS. BUT THIS YEAR FOR US WE ARE OPTIMISTIC WE STARTED SCHOOL- ALL THE KIDS ARE VERY- ARE VERY HAPPY TO BE BACK. OUR MOTTO THIS YEAR IS TO RESET RECONNECT AND REAFFIRM BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE IN THE HARBOR IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW OUR STUDENTS BY NAME BY FACE AND BY STORY. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. OUR STUDENTS ARE COMING TO US WITH PROBLEMS THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW EXIST IN OUR IN OUR DISTRICT AND SO FOR US TO FOCUS ON THE ACADEMICS. IS CRITICAL BUT WE ARE MORE FOCUSED THIS YEAR ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR STUDENTS. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUNDING- LIKE I SAID IF WE DID NOT HAVE THAT FUNDING WE WOULD NOT BEEN ABLE TO- TO MOVE OUR OUR OUR DISTRICT FORWARD. ARE NUTRITIONAL SERVICE WORKERS WE BEGAN- FEEDING. STUDENTS- AND WE NEVER STOP OCT WE FEEDING THEM WHEN WE SHOW DOWN AND- WE CONTINUE TO FEED OUR STUDENTS. BOTH FOR OUR WALK UPS AND ALSO IN ON OUR SCHOOL CAMPUSES. SO I WOULD WELCOME ANY OF YOU TO CALM I KNOW THAT WE ARE IN- SENATOR NEWMAN'S I DISTRICT. BUT I WOULD WELCOME ANY OF YOU TO COME AND VISIT BECAUSE WE ARE A VERY LOW SOCIOECONOMIC DISTRICT. AND I LOVED ALL THE QUESTIONS FROM THE SENATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY REAL QUESTIONS ON HOW WE- ADDRESS THIS POST PANDEMIC- ISSUES THAT WE HAVE AT OUR SCHOOL. AND NOW WITH THE VARIANT COMING ON AND THE ADDITIONAL FEAR THAT STAFF AND PARENTS HAVE. IT'S ONCE AGAIN- ADDRESS SCENE BE IT WHICH NOT OVER AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR PARENTS. AND OUR COMMUNITY SO WITH THE FUNDING COMING IN WE ARE ALSO USING THAT TO HELP WITH OUR VIRTUAL PROGRAM BECAUSE NOW- OUR DISTRICT DID NOT HAVE A VIRTUAL PROGRAM BECAUSE WE THERE WAS. NO NEED FOR IT AND NOW WE HAVE A NEED FOR. A LOT OF THE MONEY IS GOING INTO THE- INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM FOR PARENTS WHO ARE CHOOSING TO KEEP THEIR STUDENTS AT HOME AND IT'S A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE FOR OUR DISTRICT. SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK ALL THE SENATORS FOR ASKING THOSE CRITICAL QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR- OUR SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN FOR WHAT HE DOES FOR OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM I WOULD INVITE HIM TO COME TO. THE HARBOR SO HE CAN SEE WHAT IS GOING ON IN OUR DISTRICT- BUT WE ARE VERY PROUD. OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE OUR STUDENTS BACK- THEY STARTED MONDAY. AND THAT LET'S HOPE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO STAY IN SCHOOL FOR THE REST OF THAT FOR THIS ENTIRE. YEAR SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME. AND YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY DR CONGRESS. DOCTOR WHICH IS- PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THANK YOU AREN'T SURE LAID BACK AND NEW MAN. AND AND SENATORS- THIS IS REALLY AN HONOR TO BE A PART OF THIS GROUP OF BRILLIANCE AND- I ALSO WANNA JUST TECHNOLOGY I'M PRESIDENT FINDS THAT IT HAPPENED FOR MENTAL HEALTH. AND IT COULD GET A QUITE TOO WE HAD TWO THOUSAND STROP POSTINGS FOR JOBS FOR SCHOOL COUNSELORS THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS SO THAT MONEY IS TRICKLING INTO PEOPLE ON SITE WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. SO I HAD IT BEFORE I BECAME THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE SCHOOL COUNSELOR SIGNS OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY OR TWENTY YEARS. AND I WAS ALSO- THE CHERUB BABY EDUCATIONAL COUNSELING PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LAVERNE SOX HAD EXPERIENCE FROM K. THROUGH OUR HIGHER EDUCATION. AND AS ODD ODD TONY THURMAN SAID THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED TIMES THINGS THAT WE'LL WE'LL NOT SEE OUR FUTURE AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN OUR PAST- THE BEST WAY I CAN DO IS JUST- JUST TO BE BRIEF WITH MY COMMENTS BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. THINGS SAID THAT I AGREE WITH YOU IN JUST A SHORT FROM THE PENCIL LITTLE BIT ON A FEW POINTS. BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I'M HEARING FROM SCHOOL COUNSELORS OUT THERE IS THAT RESILIENCY REALLY VARIES BETWEEN ONE STUDENT TO ANOTHER AND AS ARE THE SUPER JANE JUST SAD WE HAVE TO KNOW EVERY STUDENT'S NAME FACE AND STORY RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO DETERMINE WHERE THEY ARE WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. ARE USING DIFFERENT MECHANISMS FOR SCREENING. BUT ONCE PERSON SAID IT REALLY BRILLIANTLY AND SAID THAT GRIEF COMES IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES BUT FOR EVERYONE IT MEANS THAT LIFE IS FOREVER CHANGED AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S THE WAY WE ARE RIGHT NOW THAT LIFE IS FOREVER CHANGED IN SOME CAPACITY. AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD IS REALLY IMPORTANT- I A. I'D BECOME ASSOCIATIONS WILL COUNT THAT ARE. OUR TWO SUPER. ABOUT A YEAR AGO WHICH TALKED ABOUT THREE TO. RE OPENING. AND ONE OF THE THAT. ADVOCATE FOR IS ASSESSING AND DIFFERENT WAYS OF ASSESSING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND TRIAGING THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED REALLY RAPIDLY AT THIS SPACE. AND ONE OF THOSE WAYS AND THERE'S ALSO A THERE'S ALL KINDS OF WAYS OF DOING IT BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ADVOCATE FOR WE PROMOTE OUR SCHOOL COUNSELORS TO DO IS TO TRAIN TEACHERS. TO SUPPORT TEACHERS IN REGARDS TO SEEING RED PLAQUES WITH STUDENTS. AND WITH THOSE RED FLAGS WHAT WE CAN DO IS STAND. I DO WARM HANDS OFF TO COMMUNITY HEALTH PROVIDERS HAVE PEOPLE ON OUR CAMPUS TO CAN HELP WITH OUR MENTAL HEALTHSERVICES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. RIGHT LET ME GIVE YOU ONE ONE PIECE THAT YOU KNOW I ASKED SCHOOL COUNSELOR SO TELL ME A STORY. ONE STRUCK ME IN ACCOUNTS ARE HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR SAYS YOU KNOW I HAVE AN ART STUDENT THIS HAS. GREAT ANXIETY BECAUSE FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS HE WAS LEARNING SPANISH ONE IN SPANISH THROUGH. ONLINE THROUGH FLASH CARDS AND NOW HE'S GOING TO DO SPANISH THREE. AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DIALOGUE IN CLASSROOMS WITH THAT AND THAT'S A LOT OF ANXIETY PRODUCING AND HE AND THE SCHOOL COUNSELOR. HAD TO WORK WITH HIM TO GET HIM BACK IN THE CLASSROOM. SO IT JERRY AS IT'S- TO WE ARE. ON BUT IT REALLY TAKES PERSONNEL. TO DO IT BECAUSE IT REALLY TAKES TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH EACH STUDENT'S LICENSE SOMETIMES IT JUST DOESN'T PRESENT ITSELF. IN A WAY THAT'S REALLY EVIDENT IN THE CLASSROOM- THERE WAS A SURVEY THAT WAS DONE RECENTLY. AND THAT WAS DONE BY THE ACLU WITH STUDENTS AND THEY DID ONE IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE RELEASED IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO. AND WITH THAT SURVEY WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT THEY CAME UP WITH. AND WHAT THEY DETERMINED WAS THAT STUDENTS SAD THAT WHAT THEY NEED IS THEY NEED PEOPLE. ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES BUT THEY CAN TRUST. AND THEN THAT TRUSTING SOMEONE THAT THEY KNOW AND THEY CAN COUNT ON IT THEY CAN SHARE WITH AND TALK THROUGH THINGS WITH STRONG. AGAIN THAT MEANS WE NEED MORE PERSONNEL SO. I JUST WANT TO SAY AND I AND I KIND OF. TOOK SOME NOTES OF SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I WAS ASKED TO THE LAST- AGAIN I WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THOSE. WHAT ARE THINGS ABOUT WORK FORCE AND I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS THAT- THERE ARE. PROBABLY THE ONLY WORK FORCE GROUP THAT HAS ENOUGH PEOPLE AVAILABLE TO FILL SOME OF THESE ROLES AS SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND- THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THIRTY EIGHT TRAINING INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE. ARE THAT ARE PRODUCING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SCHOOL COUNSELORS EVERY YEAR. ALL WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WE HAVE ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. COUNSELORS WORKING IN OUR SCHOOLS AND WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WHICH ACTED CREDENTIALS SO. I FEEL. REALLY CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN FEEL ALL ROLES EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES THE RULER IS IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO DO THAT. WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY I THINK TELEHEALTH IS REALLY- THANK GOD PRESERVE. AND FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO DO COUNSELING SERVICES WHEN WE HAVE INTERNET CONNECTIONS WITH KIDS THAT LIVE IN RURAL AREAS THAT CANNOT GET TO OTHER PLACES. THAT WE CAN DO THAT AND THE OTHER PLACES THAT ARE. TWENTY THERMOSTAT IS THAT SCHOOLS ARE THE PLACE. SKIP MOST OF THEIR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE KNOW THAT STATISTICALLY THAT'S WHERE THAT HAPPENS SO HAVING PEOPLE ON CAMPUS THAT CAN PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND BE ABLE TO HELP THEM THROUGH ROUGH SPOTS. GREAT BUT IN OTHER CASES WE CAN'T WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR WORKFORCE AND WORKFORCE ISSUES IT BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT SO WHEN I WAS A SCHOOL LEADER. WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR DATE PROSPECTOR VALUATION CHANGE WE HAD A- KID THAT WAS PSYCHOTIC TO COME OUT TO HELP US- WITH A STUDENT AND HOSPITALIZE USUALLY IS IT WAS THE END RESULT. AND LOT OF TIMES WE WOULD CALL AT NINE IN THE MORNING WE WENT TO GET SOMEONE TO LEAVE UNTIL EIGHT AT NIGHT TO DO THE ASSESSMENT. AND SO THOSE ARE THE PLACES THAT WE WERE ASKED. FIVE YEARS AGO AND IT LOOKS LIKE FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN READING IN REGARDS TO RESEARCH THAT WE'RE STILL THERE SO WE NEED TO. BUILD OUR WORKFORCE IN REGARDS TO OUR COMMUNITY WORK FORCE AND WE NEED TO INVEST. IN ONGOING FUNDING WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN BE THERE SO STUDENTS CAN TRUST THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND NOW THERE IS SOMEONE THERE TO COUNT ON THEY CAN TALK TO. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. NINE AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US DOCTOR WHICH IS- MR BRISCOE- WELCOME. AND PLEASE FOR SIX. HI GOOD AFTERNOON- UNABASHEDLY MOVE QUICKLY BUT I I'LL SOURCE WITH TO- HIGHLIGHT ALL OF CREDIT COMMENTS- THE STATE OR SHOULD- WE ALREADY MOMENT TIME- IS TRUE THAT OUR SYSTEM HAS STRUGGLED- IN FACT WE ARE THE STATE'S LARGEST OF THE NATION'S LARGEST MEDICAL PROGRAM AMONG WORST- BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THE WINDS OF CHANGE ARE BLOWING. SO WITH BOTH- WHAT REALISTIC REVIEW OF WHERE WE STAND BUT ALSO SOME REAL HOPEFULNESS. I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU THROUGH SOME KEY PRINCIPLES AND A LITTLE BIT OF DATA. SO FIRST HIS WHILE TODAY'S HEARING IS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF COLD IT. IT MUST BE NAMED THAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WERE IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. IN THE DECADE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC TWICE AS MANY CHILDREN WERE ADMITTED TO SELF INJURY THROUGH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. WE SAW A 50% INCREASE IN HOSPITALIZATION FOR PAEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH. DURING A TIME WHEN THE REST OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. SO DRAMATIC DECLINE IN BAD TASTE. YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING US SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY. THAT THEY NEED A LOT MORE THAN THEY'RE GETTING. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE RANK FORTY EIGHTH IN THE NATION AND ACCESS TO CARE FOR MEDICAID POPULATION WHICH REPRESENTS SIX OUT OF TEN CHILDREN IN THE STATE. AND BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER ALL OF THESE NUMBERS MEAN SOMETHING TO ME BOTH PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY. I HAVE WORKED AS A THERAPIST AND YOGA PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I WAS EMERGENCY ROOM SOCIAL WORKER AND I LET ONE OF THE STATE'S LARGEST. HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS I KNOW THIS WORK FROM ACTUALLY BILLING SERVICES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND SCHOOLS ARE ESSENTIAL FACTORS AT ANY RESPONSE TO SCALE. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT KOBE THESE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN GROWING IN OUR SOCIETY. MAYBE FROM FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF STRUCTURAL INEQUALITY MAYBE FROM ONE SOCIAL MEDIA BECAME AVAILABLE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE MAYBE FROM A PERPETUAL NEWS CYCLE. THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO CONSUME WHATEVER THE REASONS SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES AND WHETHER YOU EVER WERE A CHILD OR HOW. YOU'RE PROBABLY WORRIED ABOUT THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELFARE CHILDREN AND SCHOOLS ARE ON THE FRONTLINES OF THAT CHALLENGE. AND YOU HAVE TO DECIDE TO GET THIS DATA BY RACE REALLY APPRECIATE THE. QUESTIONS FROM THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM LONG BEACH. BLACK AND BROWN CHILDREN. A MUCH HIGHER PRICE. FOR THE FAILURE OF OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT THEIR SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELFARE. MAKING HEALING CENTER SCHOOLS ISN'T JUST A QUESTION OF GETTING THE MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT RATES BUT THAT'S A BIG PART. IT'S WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF OUR SURGEON GENERAL WHO'S BRINGING A BROAD CONSENSUS TO THE REALITY THAT RACE AND CLASS MATTER. THE EXPERIENCE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND I CAN SEE THIS FROM HAVING BUILD LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A SAFETY THAT NORMAL SERVICES THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES I SERVED WE'RE NOT PATHOLOGICAL. THEY WERE DEALING WITH LIVING IN A CULTURE THAT TOLD THEM THEY WEREN'T WORTH ANYTHING OR STRUGGLING WITH THE IMPACTS OF STRUCTURAL RACISM AND POVERTY ON THEIR WELFARE. AND OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TODAY HAS LARGELY FALLEN DRIVES THAT EXPERIENCE AND SO AS WE INVEST THESE DOLLARS AS WE BUILD THE CAPACITY OF SCHOOLS TO DO THIS WORK. WE MUST ALSO WE IMAGINE OURSELVES NOT AS A RESPONSE TO BEST OLOGY. BUT AS A SUPPORT FOR HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. FOR THOSE OF YOU WANT TO MASK THE IMPACT OF KOBE EVERYTHING HERE IS COMING TO PASS DRAMATIC INCREASES IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION FOR YOUNGER AND YOUNGER AGES. IN FACT IF YOU HAD WITH THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC TO THE DATA I SHOULD JOIN THE FIRST SLIDE. RADY CHILDREN'S AS ONE EXAMPLE HAS SEEN 17100% INCREASE IN EMERGING FROM UTILIZATION FOR CHILDREN. AND IN FACT WHEN YOU DECIDE TO GET JUST THE LAST YEAR. WE HAVE SEEN 34% FEWER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THEN AGAIN DESPITE THESE DRAMATIC INCREASES IN UTILITY. SO IF YOU'RE NOT A LITTLE BIT SCARED OR DEPRESSED THEN YOU'RE NOT LISTENING. AND SCHOOLS HAVE TO BE ESSENTIAL ACTORS THE DOCTOR PAM'S QUESTION ABOUT THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE. THAT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL FOR LITTLE CHILDREN ZERO TO FIVE ZERO EIGHT. WHEN KIDS GET TO BE ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD THEIR PERIODICITY MEANING HOW OFTEN THEY GO TO THE DOCTOR DECLINES DRAMATICALLY MANY CHILDREN IN THE MEDICAID SYSTEM BETWEEN THE AGE OF TWELVE AND TWENTY FOUR. GO TO THE DOCTOR ONCE OR TWICE FOR THEIR WHOLE ADOLESCENCE. SO SCHOOLS ARE ESSENTIAL ACTORS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE KIDS ARE AND DOCTORS MARCH DURING THE TIME THAT 75% OF MUSLIMS MANIFESTS. AND I'M NOT GONNA DO A BIG MEDICAID PIECE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE MEDICARE REFORM LANDSCAPE THAT'S A WHOLE SEPARATE PRESENTATION. WE HAVE UNIQUE LEADERSHIP AND INDIRECT LIKE PORN AND MARK GALLI WHO WORK INCREDIBLY SOPHISTICATED NEW TUNE TO THIS ISSUE. BUT THE FINANCES ALIGNED THERE'S REASON THAT'S THE SCHOOLS AND MEDICARE ARE LIKE PEANUT BUTTER AND CHOCOLATE. SOME OF THE UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IS SOMETIMES SO MUCH IT'S HARD TO TRACK. BUT I TRY TO ORGANIZE IT IN A FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR USE BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE. THE FIFTEEN PLUS BILLION DOLLARS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND THE FEDERAL STIMULUS DOLLARS WHICH CAN'T BE EXCLUDED. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE ARE INVESTING IN SCHOOLS YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THREE OF THESE TOGETHER. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REFORM OF OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM. SO WHY IS MEDICARE ALSO IMPORTANT. IT COVERS ALMOST SIX OUT OF TEN KIDS MORE INVOLVED IN EDUCATION PROBABLY SEVEN OUT OF TEN. AND UNFORTUNATELY LESS THAN 5% OF THOSE CHILDREN GET ACCESS TO ANY CARE AT ALL LESS THAN THREE PERCENT. ARE AN ONGOING CARE AS MEASURED BY FIVE OR MORE VISITS IN A CALENDAR YEAR. SO LET ME END WITH A SLIDE. IN WE HAVE A ONCE IN A. GENERATION OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS THAT IS A SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED EPIDEMIC OF DESPAIR. WE DIDN'T JUST CHANGE SOMETHING IN THE WATER IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS ACTUALLY DIDN'T GET SPIKED TWICE AS MANY KIDS DIDN'T GET ADMITTED FOR SELF INJURY JUST BECAUSE- OF SOMETHING IN THE WATER. WE ARE SO SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN OUR CULTURE WE ARE MAKING CHILDREN SICK. WE HAVE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REIMAGINE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT AND REDEFINE WHAT MENTAL HEALTH THIS IS NOT SIMPLY RESPONSIBLE POLICY. IT'S A SUPPORT FOR HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. AND IT IS BASED ON THE BELIEF IN THE WISDOM AND INTELLIGENCE OF LOW% INCOME COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES. I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF HUMAN SUFFERING. AND WHILE THOSE EXPERIENCES HAVE MARQUEE. MY LARGEST TAKEAWAY IS A BEAUTY AND WISDOM AND ABILITY TO SURVIVE AND EVEN THRIVE IN THE FACE OF THESE CHALLENGES. SO THIS REDEFINITION OF MENTAL HEALTH HAS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WE HAVE TO HELP SCHOOLS UNDERSTAND AND NAVIGATE THE NEXUS OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION WHICH MEANS UNDERSTANDING A COMPLEX AND EXTREMELY TROUBLED MEDICAID SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TO TEACH SCHOOLS TO PARTNER WITH THIS ORGANIZATION WHO ALREADY CAN NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. YES WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN THEIR OWN CAPACITY BUT THE ANALOGY I LIKE TO GIVE THIS IS YOUR HOUSE EDUCATION BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO OWN ALL THE FURNITURE IN IT. EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHERE IT IS. SO THE ESSENTIAL FOR SCHOOLS IS TO COORDINATE OLD UNDERSTAND MANAGE NOT NECESSARILY DO. AND FINALLY. THAT LIST OF DOLLARS I GAVE. SCHOOLS HAVE TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS STRATEGICALLY TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE PROGRAMS BASED ON BEST PRACTICES THERE ACTUALLY ARE THERE IS A CONSENSUS. ABOUT THE MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT AND THE CENTRICITY OF COORDINATION OF SERVICE TEAMS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS WORK. SO HOW IT'S STRUCTURED IS ACTUALLY PRETTY COMMONLY AGREED UPON. HOW TO FIND AND SUSTAIN IT MEANS NAVIGATING A TROUBLED MEDICAID SYSTEM. THAT'S IN THE MIDST OF REFORM. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I WANT TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEADERSHIP. OF THE CENTER OF THIS COMMITTEE. WHO CREATED A REALLY GREAT CREATE A REALLY GREAT RESOURCE GUIDE THAT I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU MISS RICHARD IF IT'S OKAY WITH ME WE WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF WE CAN SHARE A COPY OF YOUR PRESENTATION WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY- I'M ALSO WENT TO A DOCTOR CALLED RESPECT WHICH AND- FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND I'M GOING TO DIVERGE A LITTLE BIT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME FROM THE ORIGINAL PLAN SO LET US MOVE ON- TWO PANEL THREE AND THEN WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS TO BOTH THE PANELS AT ONCE SO WE DON'T RUN THE RISK OF RUNNING OUT OF. TIME AND TO THE PUBLIC- WE'RE GONNA DO OUR BEST TO GET TO PUBLIC COMMENTS- IF WE DO NOT I WILL PROVIDE AT THE END A WEBSITE FOR YOU TO SUBMIT PUBLIC COMMENT- ONLINE- MOVING ON TO THE THIRD PANEL FOR TODAY'S FINAL PANEL BUT WE WILL LOOK AHEAD AND BEYOND TO ONGOING EFFORTS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WELL BEING.

HELLO EVERYONE AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE FOR THIS INVITATION IS TRULY AN HONOR TO BE A PART OF THE PANEL. I DO WANT TO START BY JUST KIND OF REWINDING A LITTLE BIT. WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT OUR DISTRICT. OF FOCUSED HEAVILY ON DIFFERENT LEARNING OPTIONS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. A FOR NOT ONLY THE STUDENTS BUT THE COMMUNITY AND THE PARENTS AND WE- QUICKLY SPENT OUR OUR FUNDS EXAMINING THE ACCESS AND EQUITY WITH EQUIPMENT IN CONNECTION- TO VIRTUAL LEARNING. HOWEVER WE QUICKLY ALSO LEARNED THAT TRUE ACCESS TO STUDENT LEARNING MEANT THAT STUDENTS WERE ENGAGED. AND HOW CAN STUDENTS BE ENGAGED WHEN THERE IS SUCH DISPARITY WITH STUDENT NEEDS AND- WE DEVELOPED A MODEL CALLED SSDS. WHICH REPRESENTS FULTON SCHOOL DISTRICT THREE SIXTY AND IT WAS WRAPAROUND SERVICES. UNDERSTANDING THAT STUDENTS TO BE ACCESSED. TRUE LEARNING THERE IT NEEDS NEEDS TO BE MET HUNGER SHELTER. SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS. AND WITH THAT. WE LOOK AT OUR RESOURCES AN ALLOCATION- OF OUR STAFF OUR STAFF CAPACITY. TO CREATE- SIMILAR TO WHAT DOCTOR CULVERHOUSE SHARED A PERSONALIZED MODELS SO- IT WAS THE PHILOSOPHY. OF REALLY EXAMINING INDIVIDUAL STUDENT NEEDS AND THE MODEL WAS I SEE YOU YOU ARE IMPORTANT. AND YOU MATTER. BECAUSE LOST IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD WE WERE DISCONNECTED WITH STUDENTS AND FEELING. OF ARE THEY FEELING CONNECTED TO STUDENT LEARNING ARE THEY FEELING CONNECTED TO THEIR TEACHERS ARE THE FEELING CONNECTED TO. THEIR COMMUNITY AND WITH THAT- WE EXPANDED. OUR DIVISION TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL SOCIAL SERVICE ASSISTANCE ARE CAPTURED IN THE COUNSELORS- WE FOCUS HEAVILY ON POSITIVE BEHAVIOR INTERVENTION SUPPORTS- AND EXPANDING SOCIAL EMOTIONAL PRACTICES IN THE CLASSROOM.

BUT ALSO TO MOVE FORWARD WITH LEARNING IN PERSONAL LOSS WE INCLUDE ARTS. HE PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES SPORTS AS A PART OF OUR LEARNING RECOVERY BECAUSE STUDENTS DO NOT HAVE THOSE EXPERIENCES MANY DIDN'T- DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND SO WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO REALLY EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR INVITING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE HEARD AND SEEN- I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE FUNDING HAS A FACE AND A NAME TO IT. THAT IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT IN ORDER TO.

I RESIDED IN CINEMA COUNTY FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. TO WORK AS AN EDUCATOR HERE FOR TWENTY FIVE. THIRTY YEARS. MY SON IS A YOUNG ADULT WITH AUTISM WHO LOST HIS AND HIS FATHER'S HOME IN COFFEY PARK DURING THE TUBBS FIRE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. I CONTINUE TO SEE THE IMPACT OF THIS DRAMATIC EVENT. THE COMPOUNDING OF ADDITIONAL DRAMATIC EVENTS IN THE ISOLATION EXPERIENCE DURING THE NINETEEN. ON HIS AND OTHER STUDENTS EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL WELL BEING. WELL IN THE COUNTY USE THE NEW STRANGER TO FLOOD RELATED DISASTERS FOR DECADES. THERE IS NOTHING LIKE A WILDFIRE THAT COMES WITHOUT WARNING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND WHAT THAT DOES. TO A COMMUNITY ITS INFRASTRUCTURE ITS FAMILIES. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR CHILDREN OVER MANY YEARS. THERE IS ALSO NOTHING LIKE A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT CONTINUES FOR YEARS IMPACTING OUR CHILDREN'S ABILITY. TO CONNECT WITH THE WORLD AND LEARN IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVE KNOWN. IT'S BEEN ALMOST FOUR YEARS SINCE THE TUBBS FIRE OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN HERE IN CINEMA COUNTY IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE. THAT WE HAVE SEEN THREE MORE CATASTROPHIC FIRES A FLOOD AND NOW A CONDIMENT. THIS INCLUDES EVACUATING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY WHILE IN CHILDREN PLACED DUE TO COOK AT NINETEEN. FIFTY THOUSAND MORE PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED. I REALIZE OUR PANELISTS HERE TODAY TO INFORM YOU ABOUT WORK IN THE EDUCATIONAL FIELD AS IT RELATES TO COOK AT NINETEEN IN STUDENT AND PERSONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL WELL BEING.

GOING TO GIVE YOU A STEP BREAKDOWN OF THE STEPS WE USE HERE IN CINEMA COUNTY. TO SUPPORT STUDENTS IN THE WAKE OF A DISASTER. THE STEPS OR A COMBINATION OF THE STEP TRIAGE TO CARE APPROACH IN A FOCUSED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. STEP ONE. FIND OUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OUR CHILDREN DURING AND AFTER THE DISASTER. HERE WE USE A SITUATIONAL SCREENER TO FIND OUT USE A SCREENER KANSAI START IT IS A SIMPLE TWENTY QUESTION EVENT SCREENER AT EITHER SCHOOL STAFF CAN USE TO INTERVIEW A STUDENT WORK FAMILY. OR IT CAN BE DELIVERED ELECTRONICALLY FOR FAMILIES TO COMPLETE. IT GIVES INDIVIDUAL RESULTS RESULTS HIGH SCHOOL RESULTS BY DISTRICT. THIS TOOL HAS THE ABILITY TO INFORM SCHOOL LEADERS ABOUT THE SITUATION OF THAT STUDENTS. IN TO ASSIST IN THE DIRECTING RESOURCES AND TRAINING FOR SCHOOL STAFF. STEP TWO PROVIDE PSYCHOLOGICAL FOR STATE IMMEDIATELY POST DISASTER TO OUR CHILDREN AND SCHOOL STAFF. NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OR TRAINING IS ACTUALLY A FORM OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID FOR STOCK AT A SYSTEM TO KNOW HOW TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES CONNECT AGAIN TO TELL THEIR OWN TRAUMA STORY. AND A TOUCH COPING STRATEGIES TO THAT STORY OR NARRATIVE THIS EMPOWERS THE STAFF WAS SIMPLE HANDS ON TOOLS OF HOW TO TALK TO CHILDRENHOW TO TAILOR LESSONS IN CLASS WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND HOW TO CONNECT TO ITS TWO ADDITIONAL RESOURCE. STEP THREE. RESOURCE OUR SCHOOL STAFF SO THEY FEEL CONFIDENT TO RESPONSE TO OUR CHILDREN WHILE KEEPING EDUCATION MOVING FORWARD. EARLY ON CLOSE TIMES I WAS TOLD. IF YOU DO NOT GIVE THE STAFF RESOURCES AND A PATHWAY TO ACCESS THEM. YOU'LL BE SURPRISED BECAUSE STAFFEL FREEZE PERHAPS IS THAT THE EVENT NEVER OCCURRED. RESOURCE IN OUR STAFF INCLUDES HAVING KNOWN SUPPORTS AND HAVING SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO ACCESS THE SUPPORT. HAVING PUSHIN SUPPORTS INTO THE CLASSROOM AND HAVING TIME FOR SCHOOL STAFF TO ACCESS INFORMATION. TO SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS DURING THE WORK DAY THESE ARE KEY. STEP FOUR CONDUCT POST DISASTER SCREENING FOLLOWS THE SITUATIONAL SCREENING IN CINEMA COUNTY OR COUNTY OFFICE TEAMS USE THE CHILD PTSD SYMPTOM SCALE FIVE THIS EVALUATES POSTTRAUMATIC SYMPTOMS SEVERITY IN CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS IT GIVES OUR SCHOOL COUNSELING STAFF INDIVIDUALIZED STUDENT DATA.

AS I SIT HERE WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN EDUCATION- COPING WITH WILDFIRES ALONG WITH THE COMPLETE NINETEEN ENDEMIC. DOING ALL THEY CAN TO SUPPORT STUDENTS. HAVING A SENSE OF AGENCY DURING A CRISIS BY THE ADULTS IS THE BASIS OF OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE STUDENTS SUPPORT IMPLEMENT CURRICULUM ENGAGE STUDENTS IN LEARNING. DURING THE MOST CHALLENGING F TIMES.

YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND I KNOW I SPEAK FOR MY COLLEGE WE TRULY EMPATHIZE WITH. WHAT YOU AND YOUR WHOLE DISTRICT HAD BEE THROUGH. OUR NEXT PRESENTER IS DR COMPLETION- RACHAEL- PLEASE PROCEED DIRECTLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO BE HERE I'M SO HONORED TO BE PART OF THIS HEARING AND CONTRIBUTES A BIT BUT I WILL GIVE JUST. A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND I AM A RESEARCHER I'M ALSO A BOARD MEMBER OF CASTLE THE COLLABORATIVE FOR ACADEMIC SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING HERE IN CHICAGO WHERE I AM- THE NOBEL FOUNDATION ENDOWED CHAIR IN SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO SOCKS. I FEEL LIKE I'M A BIT OF AN OUTSIDER HERE BUT I'LL SAY I'M A BIG FAN OF CALIFORNIA AND HAVING RICH RESEARCH ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING ON SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING. YOU REALLY ARE A BEACON FOR THE NATION AND A PROTOTYPE OF THE WAYS HE MOVED FORWARD SO I REALLY I JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE EVERYONE'S EFFORTS AND- I KNOW YOU CAN OFTEN PICK OUT THE THINGS THAT AREN'T WORKING BUT I WILL JUST TELL YOU FROM OUTSIDE. YOU REALLY ARE A LEADER IN THE NATION IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING SUCKS I'M JUST GOING TO MENTION THREE THINGS ONE IS I AM I HAVE BEEN DOING RESEARCH FOR THE PAST THIRTY PLUS YEARS ON SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES. I SPENT MY ENTIRE CAREER FOR STARTING OFF AS A TEACHER IN ELEMENTARY AND- HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER FOR AT RISK YOUTH. AND CAME TO REALLY STUDY SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNIG BECAUSE OF ITS FOCUS ON PREVENTION AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE OF HOW MUCH- YOU KNOW IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS BUT ALSO TO SEE. HOW WE CAN PREVENT HEM AND HAD THEM OFF ESPECIALLY IN THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME I'M REALLY NEED INTENTIONAL EFFORTS. MIND UP- IS A PROGRAM WHICH I'VE BEEN DOING RESEARCH FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS IT'S THAT EVIDENCE BASED SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN AGES THREE TO FOURTEEN. IT IS- INVOLVES BASICALLY THE INCORPORATION OF NEUROSCIENCE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY- AS WELL AS MINDFUL ATTENTION AWARENESS- CHILDREN- ENGAGE IN A NUMBER OF LESSONS ACROSS THE SCHOOL YEAR. OR THEY LEARN ABOUT THEIR BRAIN AND HOW THEIR BRAIN WORKS AND IF IMPACT OF STRESS ON THEIR BRAIN AND THEN REALLY- DID AL. KIND OF A QUICK A QUICK TO- WITH THE TOOLBOX. FOR STRATEGIES TO HELP YOU L. WITH STRESS BUT NOT ONLY- HOW TO REDUCE YOUR STRESS BUT ALSO HOW TO ONCE THEY LEARN THE STRATEGIES TO REDUCE YOUR OWN STRESS. HOW TO HEAR AND BEHIND FOR OTHERS SO THEY ENGAGE IN. ACTS OF GRATITUDE PERFORMING ACTS OF KINDNESS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY ACTION SO. THIS PROGRAM HAS REALLY BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME IT'S- INCLUDED IN A NUMBER OF OUR CLASSROOMS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND THE RESEARCH. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT RESEARCH STUDIES- REALLY SHOWING IT'S AFFECTED AND NOT ONLY REDUCING. STRESS ABOUT REALLY PROMOTING THESE POSITIVE HUMAN QUALITIES OF COMPASSION. AND WELL BEING- AND ALSO HAVE FOUND THAT INCREASES ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS- REALLY. INCLUDES ALL OF THOSE STRATEGIES. KIND UP IS NOW EXPANDING TO INCLUDE A FOCUSED ON- AND FOR PARENTS AS WELL AS- IN SPORTS AND BEYOND. AND AND NOW FOR TEACHERS AND THAT'S REALLY THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS ONE OF THINGS I HAVEN'T HEARD. DISCUSSED AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE IS WHAT WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH. AND SYSTEMIC APPROACHES TO SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING WE NOT ONLY INCLUDE THE PROVISION ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES PROMOTE THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL COMPETENCIES OF STUDENTS. BUT HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT WE PROMOTE THE WELL BEING OF TEACHERS- WE KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WITH THE- RECENT RAND STUDY. FOUND THAT- WITH THE PANDEMIC THERE'S ACTUALLY ONE IN FOUR TEACHERS WERE PLANNING ON LEAVING THE PROFESSION. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HUGE TEACHER SHORTAGE AND HOW CAN YOU HAD THAT OFF- AND WHAT WE KNOW IT'S UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF STRESS. AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO JUST MENTION THE STUDY THAT WE DID. A FEW YEARS AGO ABOUT STRESS CONTAGION IN THE CLASSROOM YES STRESS IS CONTAGIOUS AND EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT STRESSED. IF YOU'RE AROUND PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGHLY STRESSED YOU WILL CATCH IT. AND HAVE THE NEGATIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES. EXAMINE THIS IN THE CLASSROOM WE LOOKED AT PORT THE SEVENTH GRADE CLASSROOMS. AND HEAD TEACHERS COMPLETE A MEASURE OF STRESS AND BURNOUT. AND THEN FOR THE STUDENTS WE WANT. TO GET THEIR STRESS UNDER THE SKIN TO SEE. HOW WERE THEY TO AND THERE'S A HORMONE CORTISOL. WHICH YOU CAN COLLECT AND SALIVA SO WE WENT TO THE STUDENTS AND WE YES WE DID COLLECT THEIR SALIVA AND JUST SO YOU KNOW FOR THE SEVENTH GRADE KIDS LIKE TO GIVE YOU THEIR SPENT- AND SHIPPED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THEIR STRESS PHYSIOLOGY. WHAT WE FOUND WAS FASCINATING WE FOUND THOSE CLASSROOMS IN WHICH THE TEACHERS REPORTED THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF STRESS AND BURNOUT. HAD STUDENTS WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF STRESS. SO WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THAT IF YOU ACTUALLY- HELP THE TEACHERS AND HELP THEIR WELL BEING. THERE WILL BE A- A RIPPLE EFFECT INTO THE CLASSROOM FOR THE POSITIVE WELL BEING OF STUDENTS. SO I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO REALLY THINK OF OUR EDUCATORS AS WELL AS ONE. IN WHICH I'VE BEEN DOING RESEARCH FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IS INCORPORATING S. YELL INTO TEACHER PREPARATION- IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE A WIDE SCALE- UPTAKE ACROSS. YOUR ENTIRE STATE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO ACTUALLY INTEGRATE- THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND MENTAL HEALTH WITHIN. OUR TEACHER PREPARATION AND I AND I CAN TELL YOU THE DEGREE TO WHICH THAT IS HAPPENING A BIT IN YOUR STATE- AND FINALLY. MAY REALLY WANT TO MENTION IS THIS NOTION OF CALIFORNIA BEING A LEADER AND THE IDEA OF ASSESSMENT IS SO CRITICAL- AND THE IDEA- I'VE WORKED IN- I ACTUALLY WORKED FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA CANADA WHERE I WAS A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA. WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAD A PER PROVINCE WIDE- POPULATION MONITORING PROBES AND CHILD WELL BEING THAT WE DID- OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND YOU KNOW HOW FUN AT UCLA'S ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THAT LEAD SO. I MAY SAY I HAD SOME GREAT IDEAS AND THINKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY MEASURE THIS. AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO END WITH ONE ONE STATEMENT AND I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH A PART OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING. IS THAT A SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING IS NOT ONE MORE THING ON TEACHERS PLAYED IT IS ACTUALLY THE PLATE AND SO. I JUST AM SO- JUST HONORED TO BE HERE AND TO HEAR ABOUT THE AMAZING EFFORTS HAPPENING. AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS ANYONE MIGHT YEAH THANK YOU. THANK YOU- DOCTOR SHOWN RADICAL- AND- NOW WE GET TO OUR LAST PRESENTER- DOCTOR STEPHEN EDELSTEIN. AND EMILY. IS STEPHEN AND ADAMANT ON AND WE PLAYED FOR SIX. SO MUCH OF REALLY REALLY QUICK BECAUSE YOU NEED TO HEAR FROM THE FAMILY SO- I JUST WANT TO SAY A COUPLE THINGS YOU KNOW I EIGHT- I'M NOT SOME PSYCHIATRIST AT STANFORD I WORKED IN SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH FOR MANY YEARS AS A DIRECTOR OF SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS IN NEW MEXICO AND AS A NATIONAL CONSULTANT AND I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M EXCITED TO SEE THE WORK THAT'S HAPPENING HERE ACROSS CALIFORNIA A LOT OF THE EFFORTS SO WE'VE ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN A- REVOLVED AROUND YOU SUICIDE PREVENTION. WORKING WITH TRIBAL PROGRAMS. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU KNOW AS AS I'VE KIND OF MOVED TO CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN SO GRATEFUL TO SEE THE SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH IT'S BEEN DEVELOPING NOW. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT FOR THE BROAD BASED IMPLEMENTATION. OF MODELS AND PROGRAMS AND ONE OF THINGS I WOULD SHARE WITH YOU TODAY IS THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO LOOK AT FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. HOW DO WE BUILD A CONTINUUM OF EARLY INTERVENTION MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. FROM SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH TO OTHER MODELS I THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN DISCUSSED EARLIER ONE OF THE MODELS WE'VE REALLY BEEN INVOLVED IN THROUGH THE SUPPORT FROM. ALL OF YOU IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND ME ALWAYS SEE HAS BEEN AROUND THE DROPOUT PREVENTION FINDS. IN DEVELOPING THE ALL CODES MODEL OF INTEGRATED YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. AND THESE ARE MODELS AND SITES THAT ARE DEVELOPING ACROSS THE STREET. WITH THE NOTION OF BEING ABLE TO LINK EARLY MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. EARLY PRIMARY CARE VERY MUCH LIKE THE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER MODEL AND REFERENCING THE ROLE. AS A SENATOR PAN MENTION OF PRIMARY CARE AS CRITICAL PARTNERS. BUT ALSO WAS SUPPORTED EDUCATION SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT. PEER SUPPORT AS WELL FOR EARLY SUPPORT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT CAN LINK TO SCHOOLS. AS PART OF AN EFFECTIVE COMFORTABLE PLACE AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE AN ADDITIONAL TRUSTED PLACE TO SCHOOLS. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO COME IN FOR EARLY CARE. WHAT'S BEING CRITICAL ABOUT DEVELOPING THIS MODEL HAS BEEN THE ROLE OF THE YOUTH VOICE. IN DEVELOPING THE SERVICES AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE YOUTH PERSPECTIVE. TODAY ON SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS. SO REALLY EMILY IS GOING TO SPEAK TO THAT IMPORTANCE. OF THE ROLE OF THE USER VOICE IN DEVELOPING ALL CALLED MODELS AND- THE INTEGRATION WITH SCHOOLS AND WHY THAT'S JUST SO CRITICAL. SO EMILY LET ME HAND THINGS OVER TO YOU. I THINK IT'S AT ALL SAY THANK TO EVERYONE HERE THE SENATOR ND ALL THE ADULT B. R. PANEL HERE YOUR AMAZING SOME- I WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL I CAN SAY THAT I'M SO HONORED AND SO GRATEFUL THAT STUDENT AND YOUR DENTAL HEALTH IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE DISCUSSED IN OUR SOCIETY HAS BECOME A MORE SUPPORT IN OUR COMMUNITY- BRIEF INTERACT ENGINE INTRODUCTION SORRY- I'M PART OF THE- YOUTH ADVISORY GROUP AND ACTS OF COKE SO I AM ALONG WITH. AROUND TWENTY FOUR OTHERS USE WE GOT TWO POINTS DECISIONS AND I CAN SAY THE OUTCOME HAS BEEN TRULY SOMETHING UNIQUE AND SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO ANYTHING ELSE I'VE BEEN PART OF MY WHOLE LIFE SO FIRST AND FOREMOST- OUTCOME HAS REALLY PROVIDED THE CONFIDENCE AND EMPOWERMENT AND THE VALIDATION THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR OWN NEEDS AN ADVOCATE FOR THEIR APPEARANCE NEEDS. AND SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY AWESOME ABOUT THE YOUR DEVICE A GROUP THAT I'M PART OF IS THAT WE GOT TO INFLUENCE THESE LARGE DECISIONS THAT WE'VE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT AND WHENEVER WE'VE TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE WE GOT TO INFLUENCE HOW THE SITE LOOKS LIKE WHAT- HOW YOURS ARE TREATED AND THE INSIGHT HOW- LIKE THE CONFIDENTIALITY HOW SAFE THEY FEEL IN THE SIDE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE CAMERAS IN CERTAIN PLACES. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE WEBSITE LOOKS LIKE OR WHAT THE LOGO LOOKS LIKE- YEAH HOW HOW THEY ARE DRESSED LIKE NITTY GRITTY NITTY GRITTY DETAILS ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP WHERE INVOLVED AND WE'RE SO ONORED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S TRULY. UNIQUE I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. OUR OPINION AND GOALS AND NEEDS ALSO IN. VALIDATED AND I'LL GO AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S IN. KIND OF MARTIN LUTHER SIDE AS A ADVISORY GROUP MEMBER. AS A SERVICE- SOMEONE WHO IS ACCESSING SERVICES YOUR GOALS ARE HEARD. THERE ARE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE. THAT MAKE UP A COHESIVE COMMUNITY WHO ARE THERE TO SUPPORT YOUR NEEDS AND TO LISTEN. AND TO TRULY BE PART OF A CONVERSATION THAT. THAT'S I'M WORKING TOWARDS A MUTUAL GOAL OF. YOUR MENTAL WELLNESS WHETHER REGARDLESS OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SH- AND BEING PART OF THE YOUTH ADVISOR GROUP HAS ALSO DEINITELY REALLY HELPED ME FEEL MORE ORGANIZED. I A AUTONOMY OR THAT I FEEL THAT I HAVE MORE AGENCY AND- BEING ABLE TO EXECUTE MY GOALS SO BEFORE I DON'T KNOW WHAT BEFORE I DIDN'T KNOW SAY LIKE D. D. E. R. LAWS OR REGULATIONS BEHIND WHAT I MAY WANT TO DO FOR MY COMMUNITY OR- WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD FEEL I WOULD BE- MY CONFIDENTIALITY WOULD BE RESPECTED IF I WERE TO. SAY ACCESS THERAPY MYSELF SO I COULD DEFINITELY PROVIDES THAT AND I KNOW THAT YOU OFTEN FEEL UNSURE OR INSECURE ABOUT ACCESSING SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE- MARK WHAT'S TRANSPARENT SIDE ABOUT ACCESSING SERVICES AND- I CAN ASSURE YOU CAN CHECK OUT FOR YOU- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT OUTCOME HAS HELPED ME. TAKE BETTER CARE OF MYSELF AND ALSO OTHERS WE HAVE TRAININGS AND SO MANY OTHER AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES THAT- HELP ME SUPPORT MYSELF AND OTHERS INCLUDING ONE ANOTHER YEAR FROM MY PEERS OR JUST. MY FAMILY MEMBERS OR OTHER PEOPLE AROUND ME. AND IT'S ALSO DEFINITELY ME IN THE- SENSE OF SELF CARE AND CARE IN GENERAL. IS THAT ON MANTA HOLD REALLY LOOKS DIFFERENT FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON SO. I'M SO HONORED AND GRATEFUL THAT I GET TO BE PART OF THIS GROUP BECAUSE I LEARNED FROM SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND I GOT TO SPEAK WITH SO MANY. STRONG AND LIKE PASSIONATE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUCH DIVERSE EXPERIENCES AND BACKGROUNDS. BUT THEY EACH HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO BRING FROM THE TABLE AND I BELIEVE THAT REALLY IS. A VITAL STEP IN OUR COMMUNITY TO. DEVELOP THE BEST- SERVICES THAT CAN BE TAILORED TO VARIOUS PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU ARE AT. THE HOUSE SH. AND FINALLY I WOULD SAY- CODE HAS BEEN THE PROVIDE AN EDUCATION AND THE COMMUNITY THAT I NEED TO. REALLY UNDERSTAND MENTAL HEALTH WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S HOW I'M GONNA SUPPORT MYSELF OR OTHERS. SO WHEN I FIRST JOINED SOMETHING THAT I HAD LEARNED IS THAT- SO. HEARING FROM EVERYONE HERE I MAYBE IT MAYBE OR MAYBE NOT YOU PART OF THIS. BUT I LEARNED THAT HALF OF ALL MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS BEGIN UP. BEGIN AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN SO. ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW SOMEONE PERSONALLY WHO IS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD- I GUESS I'LL REMIND YOU THAT FOURTEEN IS GENERALLY THE AGE FOR MOST USE. WHEN YOU'RE TRANSITIONING BETWEEN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL. SO- I THINK IF I AN **** I CAN. LIKE I TRUST THAT YOU CAN MAYBE TRY TO REMEMBER THAT A PRETTY DIFFICULT TIME. YOU'RE FACING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL AND- EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES OF THAT'S LIKE. YOU KNOW YOU'RE TRANSITIONING INTO A COMPLETELY NEW ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS HIGH SCHOOL THAT GIVES YOU A DEFINITE. AND YOU'RE IN A NEW ENVIRONMENT WITH YOUR PEERS NEW TEACHERS NEW CLASSES SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE BEING THROWN AT YOU AND THEN YOU'RE ALSO BEING. YOU'RE ALSO TRYING TO NAVIGATE WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON AND HOW YOU WANT TO OPERATE AND FUNCTION. AS THEIR OWN SELVES IN THIS. VAST COMMUNITY ABOUT SOCIETY. SO THE FACT THAT MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS STARTED SUCH A YOUNG AGE AND THEN. YET SO LIKE AS RARELY TALK ABOUT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT STATISTIC UNTIL UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN I JOINED TACOS. IT REALLY LIKE SHOCKED ME IN AND- REALLY BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THE WIDESPREAD ISSUE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE COMMUNITY ABOUT THE NEED TO RELY ON. AND ESPECIALLY IN THAT TRANSITION TRANSITIONING AGE BETWEEN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL NOW I WANT TO TRANSITION FROM BACK INTO HOW- RETURNING BACK TO SCHOOL IS A WHOLE OTHER TRANSITION. TRANSITIONING PROCESS I CAN BE A LARGE CHALLENGE SO. AFTER OVER A YEAR OF BEING AND THE PANDEMIC WE I KNOW WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT- I MEAN THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL. AND SO NOW WE HAVE TO RE ADOPT TO WHAT IT USED TO BE LIKE OR WHAT WHAT'S THE CLOSEST TO WHAT IT USED TO BE LIKE THERE'S A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF DEMAND AND- HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PERFORM PERFORM ACADEMICALLY. WHAT KIND OF LEARNING STYLE YOU'LL BE AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL YOU'RE STILL STAYING ONLINE. THE SOCIAL SOCIALIZATION OF THINGS OPEN BACK UP THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS FOR YOU TO BE INSECURE ABOUT. ALONG WITH. ANYONE REALLY THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT. WERE UNSURE ABOUT THAT MAY BE WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE IN YOUR SCHOOL ARE UNVACCINATED OR- THE DELTA AREA AS A WHOLE OTHER ISSUE AND IF YOU EVER EXPERIENCED THINGS LIKE SOCIAL ANXIETY OR TO SOMEBODY AND BEING AROUND PEOPLE. REGARDLESS OF AGE TO WHAT EXTENT THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT AND- NEWS I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO FEEL VALIDATED. AND LIKE- PREVIOUS COUNCIL ALSO MENTIONED SALUTE SO DID THE TEACHERS AND- I REALLY COMMEND TEACHERS FOR ALWAYS BEING THERE FOR THE STUDENTS. AND I'M REALLY THANKFUL FOR THAT. SO LIKE I SAID I. WANT EVERYONE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS A- A CENTRALLY IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN USED TO IT FOR. ALMOST TWO YEARS. AND YEAH IT'S IMPORTANT TO VALIDATE YOU THREE YEARS FOUND THIS TRANSITION IS INTIMIDATING. AND PLEASE BE OKAY REGARDLESS OF WHO YOU ARE WHETHER OR NOT YOUR NEWS OR STUDENT OR- ADULT. Z. OKAY WITH BEING. PERFORMING AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL BECAUSE IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT. I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK FORWARD TO IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO. MAKE THIS TRANSITION LESS OF A BLIND JUMP INTO A COMPLETELY NEW ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE FEEL INSECURE. AND MORE OF A SMOOTH PATH WHERE WE HAVE RESOURCES TO FALL BACK ON. WHEREVER YOU ARE OR WE FORCE IT RESOURCES TO LOOK FORWARD TO EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. SO IN ORDER TO FEEL SECURE I FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING. FOR EVERYONE TO LOOK TOWARDS- I'D ALSO LIKE SAY. ON OF VISIBILITY IS VERY VITAL AND- I KNOW THAT THINGS HAVE BEEN IMPROVING THIS YEAR AND I'VE SEEN THAT IN MY OWN SCHOOL. SCHOOLS MUST BE DOING BETTER THAN JUST FOR EXAMPLE PRINTING A SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE NUMBER ON THE BACK OF STUDENT ID CARDS THAT'S VERY PASSIVE WE DON'T SEE IT OFTEN DEPENDING ON WHAT SCHOOL YOU GO TO YOU MIGHT NOT USE YOUR ID CARDS VERY OFTEN. AND IT JUST BEING THERE AND I WAS NOT GETTING TO KNOW WHAT IS ON THOSE CARDS WHAT EXACTLY THAT ENTAILS IF I WERE TO CALL THIS NUMBER WHAT HOPE WHAT I RECEIVED OR- WHEN THEY ACTUALLY PICK UP OR WOULD THEY ACT WHEN THEY PUT ME ON HOLD WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT RESOURCES WHEN THEY BE OFFERING TO ANSWER THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT AND THIS OCCASION ABOUT THESE MEN ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN CURRENTLY ACCESS AND WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS MUST BE NORMALIZED SO THAT TEACHERS AND STUDENTS ALIKE CAN FEEL SECURE ABOUT WHAT WHAT THEY HAVE. AT. THEIR DISCRETION OR AT. AT THE OTHER THING- YEAH SO AGAIN WITH BEING PROACTIVE I REALLY THINK THAT. REGARDLESS OF IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT MORE OF THE ACT DON'T MAKE SENSE OR IN THE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS WE'VE REALLY BEEN TRYING TO REACH STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE SO I CAN BE AN ACADEMIC SENSE FOR EXAMPLE OFFERING MORE OFFICE HOURS FOR TUTORING. OR ONLINE RESOURCES VIDEOS LECTURES WEBSITES SO ON AND SO FORTH OR EVEN JUST KEEPING YOUR DOOR OPEN BETWEEN PASSENGERS OR LUNCH OR BRUNCH THE SITE YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE. THERE ARE THINGS THAT THEY CAN ACCESS IF THEY NEED IT. IN SCHOOL- MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES. I'VE SEEN THAT IT'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE POPULAR RECENTLY WHICH I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR BUT WHEN IT. COMES LOOSE CLINICIANS SOCIAL WORKERS PSYCHIATRISTS OR EVEN JUST WORKSHOPS THAT ARE. CREATED BY GUEST SPEAKERS OR- JUST. EARLY MENTAL HEALTH AND EDUCATION WILL REALLY BENEFIT. BECAUSE WE WELL UNDERSTAND WHAT WORK RACE AND WILL KNOW. THAT IT'S NOT IT'S VALID BECAUSE- EVERYONE HAS MENTAL HEALTH AND- WE I THINK WE HAVE THE SUBWAY FROM THE IDEA THAT- MENTAL HEALTH HAS ONE STRICT DEFINITION OR ABOUT IT LIKE IF IT. FITS INTO THIS ONE SPECIFIC BOX BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T BECAUSE IT CAN. COME IN MANY SHAPES AND FORMS DEPENDING ON HOW YOU'RE BROUGHT UP OR MAYBE EVEN JUST. YOU KNOW JUST LIKE COMMUNITY FACTORS. A LITTLE HELP IS THERE ANY TO CUT YOU OFF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR- REALLY IS APPRECIATED REALLY IS INSIGHTFUL. WE ARE ENFORCING COMING UP. ON THE ADVERTISEMENT ALSO THANK. ALL OF THE SEVEN OTHER PETITIONS BECAUSE THE OTHER TWO PANELS WE HAVE TIME FOR ALL OF I THINK TWO QUESTIONS. FROM MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR PENN  SEE YOU MR DALIO TO USE A LET'S START WITH SENATOR PAN- FOR ANY OF THE PANELISTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND PERHAPS MORE A COMMENT AND A QUESTION- I WOULD MAKE NOTE OF THAT- MR OF THE ATI LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS THAT- WINDOWS THAT ACTUALLY- ASIAN AMERICAN STUDENTS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE LEARNING REMOTELY- THAN ANY OTHER RACIAL ETHNIC GROUP IN THE UNITED STATES ISN'T BORN OUT OF THE DATA. BECAUSE NOT ONLY DID FREIGHT OF COVETED- ARE CONCERNED ABOUT COVE IT HAS LIKE MANY OTHER PARENTS- ALSO BECAUSE OF THE HATE DIRECTED TOWARD. ATI STUDENTS SENT IT AND H. I. COMMUNITY AND SO I THINK AS WE'RE LOOKING AT- PROVIDING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES. WE HAVE TO LOOK THINK ABOUT IT'S NOT ONLY FOR THE STUDENTS TO ACTUALLY SHOP FOR IN PERSON LEARNING IT'S ALSO OPTIONS FOR DISTANCE LEARNING AND ALSO PROVIDING THOSE SUPPORTS FOR DISTANCE LEARNING AS WELL. AND CREATING A VERY SAFE ENVIRONMENT IN THE SCHOOLS SO- IN TERMS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. WHEAT AND FORTUNE WE DON'T ONLY HAVE A VIRAL PANDEMIC WE ALSO HAVE A HEAT CAN DAMAGE. AND FOR CITY H. I. COMMUNE'S PARTICULARLY BEEN TARGETED- AS AND UNFAIRLY BLAMED US FOR THIS PANDEIC AND SO THIS IS CAUSING. IT AND THIS IS IN A GROUP OF. PEOPLE WHO USUALLY YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT ALL THERE TO WANT TO ALWAYS WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL AND THE FACT IS THE DATA SHOWS THAT MUCH LESS LIKELY TO ACTUALLY GO TO IN PERSON LEARNING SO I HOPE THAT- I KNOW WE'RE VERY SHORT TIME BUT I HOPE THAT- I KNOW OUR PANELISTS AND EDUCATION COMMITTEE WILL BE THINKING VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND I KNOW THAT OUR STATE BUDGET WE AS PART OF THE THAI EQUITY BUDGET AS WELL- ALLOCATE SOME MONEY. THAT'S RIGHT THE DIRECT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT TO HELP SCHOOLS I FIGURE THIS OUT AND THEY GET SOME RESOURCES THERE AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WILL WILL PUT ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. THANK THANK MY OWN THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIR AS WELL AS A- EMILY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I THINK THAT WAS OUTSTANDING OBVIOUSLY NO ISOLATION IS THE NUMBER ONE ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE REASONS FOR A DEPRESSION AND THE LIKE SO- ALCO IS IT A GREAT ORGANIZATION I'M EXCITED TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. MY QUESTION IS TO AND I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED BY THE SLIDES THAT ALEX I BELIEVE WAS ALEX THAT 2% OF THOSE SLIDES VERY IMPRESSED BY THAT IN YOUR HISTORY OF SHOWING US THAT EVEN PRIOR PANDEMIC WE HAD LOTS OF ISSUES THAT- WE SHOULD'VE BEEN ADDRESSING. AS LEGISLATORS WE ALLOCATE MONEY THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE DO WE ALLOCATE THE MONEY AND WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE POLICY BUT WE'RE REALLY. NOT EXPERTS IN ALL FIELDS WERE WERE JACKS OF ALL TRADES WE KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS AND SOME OF US ARE EXPERTS IN ONE AREA BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT AN EXPERT IN- THE HEALTH- ONLY. BY OBSERVANCE OR DEALING WITH OUR OWN FAMILY MEMBERS ARE CONSTITUENTS. IF MONEY WAS NOT A FACTOR. AND PAUL AS IT WERE- IS THERE SOME PROGRAMS THAT YOU COULD POINT US TO AND I THINK ALEX MIGHT BE THE BEST ONE TO ANSWER THIS THAT ACTUALLY WORK THAT WE WERE WE ACTUALLY HEAL PEOPLE- AND THERE'S A FORMULA I'M LOOKING FOR- SOMETHING WE IS WHAT WORKS IF WE HAD ALL THE- IF WE HAD EVERYTHING WE NEEDED THIS IS HOW THIS WOULD BE THE PERFECT MODEL DO YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION. SO THAT WE COULD THEN ANALYZE AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE WOULD THEN. ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES TO GET THERE. I'LL BE VERY BRIEF BUT THE ANSWER IS YES YES YES. WE KNOW THAT CULTURALLY RELEVANT BEHAVIOR HEALTH SUPPORTS THAT A RELATIONSHIP BASED. IMPROVE SCHOOL SUCCESS. IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IMPROVE LIFE OUTCOMES AND ARE ESSENTIAL TO HEALTHY GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN. I WILL SEND A COUPLE SLIDES TO THE STAFF AND INTERACTING WITH JUST SO YOU CAN SEE A LIST OF FOUR EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. HOW COOL IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE. OF THESE TYPE OF SERVICES THE CHALLENGE AND I THINK IT WAS NAMED BY EMILY AND SOME OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS WHAT WE SAY IS THERAPIST IS ALL THERAPEUTIC GAME PRESUPPOSES THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD IF THEY'RE TOO SHORT TO KEEP ONE TALK TO YOU. SO THE ESSENTIAL CHALLENGE FOR US IS IN DO WE HAVE MODELS THAT WORK. IS CAN WE FINANCE THEM. AND PLACE THEM WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE WILL ACCESS SEVEN. DELIVERED BY PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE THEM AND YOU CAN GENERATE TRUST AN ALLIANCE WITH THEM. AWESOME I WOULD REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT SO THAT WE AS LEGISLATORS CAN. RESEARCH THAT INFORMATION. AND PUT IN A MALL I'M A FARMER I KNOW IF YOU HAVE SUNLIGHT WATER AND GET SO- YOU'RE GONNA GROW CROP DOWN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME VARIABLES IN THERE. AND ANOTHER'S VARIABLES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE BUT IF WE HAVE THOSE BASIC THINGS AS LEGISLATORS THEN WE CAN THEN TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THOSE TOOLS. RESOURCES TO MAKE THOSE TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR YOU SO I APPRECIATE ALL THAT THE TESTIMONY IT WAS A VERY- LEARNING AND I LOOK FOR THOSE- BE HAVING AVAILABLE THE SLIDES THAT WERE AVAILABLE THOSE I THINK WERE VERY IMPACTFUL LEAST WHAT I COULD READ FROM THIS DISTANCE- SO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. BOTH TO MY CO CHAIRS- THAT TO PUT THIS COMMITTEE TOGETHER SEE WERE THE LAST ONES HERE ALSO. THANK YOU.

A HEALTH ISSUE THAN A LONG LIST OF DEATHS BY OTHER DISEASES LISTEN ON CDC WEBSITE. HERE'S TO REPAIR AND GRANDPARENTS FIFTIES COMMITTEES ARE MORE INTERESTED IN TAKING AWAY PARENTS RIGHTS WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. THE MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S JOB WE PARENTS WANT NORMAL SCHOOLING WITHOUT AN ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR AND OPPRESSION. WITH THIS LOSS OF SCHOOL CONTROL AND SAFE PROPER LOWER LEARNING ENVIRONMENT STUDENT RE ENGAGEMENT WILL HAPPEN WITH A RETURN TO NORMALCY IN OUR SCHOOLS WITHOUT THESE RESTRICTIONS AND FEAR MONGERING. BY LABELING TO CHILDREN WITH MENTAL ISSUES. CHILDREN ARE RESILIENT ROVER OVERCOME OBSTACLES OF THIS PANDEMIC WITHOUT THE INFUSION OF BUREAUCRACY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PUBLIC COMMENT.
