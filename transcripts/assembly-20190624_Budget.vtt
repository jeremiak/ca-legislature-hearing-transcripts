THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:12.130
QUESTION ABOUT THE THE MANDATE

00:32:12.196 --> 00:32:14.232
AND THE PENALTY SO ORIGINALLY

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:15.433
THE COUNT CONCEPT WAS TO HELP

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.536
THE PENALTY REVENUE PAY FOR THE

00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:20.605
SUBSIDIES AND I I REALIZE THAT

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:21.706
WITH THE SUBSIDIES ENDED UP

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:22.840
BEING BIGGER THAN THE PENALTY

00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:23.875
REVENUE SO THE STATE'S GOING

00:32:23.941 --> 00:32:26.377
AFTER AUGMENTED BUT THAT.

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:26.978
THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:31.883
RIGHT -- THAT WAS THE THAT WAS

00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:34.419
THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS IN THE

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:35.920
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND A REVISION

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:36.954
BUT AS YOU NOTED THE FINAL

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:39.223
CONFERENCE PACKAGE -- INCLUDES

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.159
SUBSIDY APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:43.561
IN EXCESS OF THE REVENUES OVER

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:44.629
THE MULTI YEAR WINDOW OKAY SO

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:46.197
MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER A QUESTION

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:47.398
THAT'S BEEN PUZZLING ME.

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:48.900
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE

00:32:48.966 --> 00:32:51.569
SUBSIDIES GO -- THE BULK OF THEM

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:53.538
WERE GOING FOR HOUSEHOLDS THAT

00:32:53.604 --> 00:32:55.239
ARE BETWEEN 40% 6100% OF THE

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:57.275
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL SO WHEN I

00:32:57.342 --> 00:32:59.143
DO THE MATH ON THAT THAT'S FOR

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.179
AN INDIVIDUAL SIX ARE PERCENT AS

00:33:01.245 --> 00:33:02.046
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR AND

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:03.147
FOR A FAMILY OF THREE IT'S

ALMOST A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:05.717
A YEAR.

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:06.384

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:06.617
INCOME.

00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:07.218
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS

00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:09.387
FROM WHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE

00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:10.722

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:16.928
A YOUNG.

00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:17.462
ARE YOUNGER.

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:19.997
HEALTHY PERSON MAKING BETWEEN

00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:20.631
THIRTY THIRTY THOUSAND AND FIFTY

00:33:20.698 --> 00:33:21.666
THOUSAND YEARS SO HERE'S MY

00:33:21.733 --> 00:33:22.900
PUZZLEMENT IS.

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:24.235
WHY ARE WE?

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:26.471
TAKING REVENUE FROM.

00:33:26.537 --> 00:33:28.106
PEOPLE MAKING THIRTY TO FIFTY

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.073

DOLLARS A YEAR THAT MAKES NO

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:36.981
SENSE TO ME -- WELL I THINK I

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:39.050
WOULD NOTE THAT -- LOOKING AT

00:33:39.117 --> 00:33:41.619
ONLY THE STATE SUBSIDY COMPONENT

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:43.187
OF THE OVERALL PICTURE.

00:33:43.254 --> 00:33:45.323
MIGHT LEAD ONE TO CONCLUDE THAT

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.325
I WOULD SAY THAT -- IF YOU

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:50.194
INCLUDE THE COMPARABLY GENEROUS

00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:51.362

00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:15.853
WELL BUT BETWEEN BETWEEN TWO

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.021
HUNDRED AND 4100% FILE POVERTY

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:19.490

FOR FEDERAL FUNDS MATCH -- AND

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:57.902
ACTUALLY BUT BY SHOULD CORRECT

00:38:57.968 --> 00:38:59.570
WHAT I SAID YEAH IT'S IT'S

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:01.372
ACTUALLY THROUGH AGE TWENTY FIVE

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:04.341

00:39:04.408 --> 00:39:05.876
UNDER CURRENT LAW THE CURRENT.

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:07.178
FEDERAL.

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:09.413
MEDICAID PROGRAM -- UNDOCUMENTED

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.215
INDIVIDUALS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:13.017
CERTAIN SERVICES WE REFER TO

00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:14.085
THEM AS RESTRICTED SCOPE

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:16.454
COVERAGE GENERALLY THEY ARE

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.422
EMERGENCY SERVICES AND PREGNANCY

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:21.358
RELATED SERVICES -- UNDER OUR

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:25.096
EXPANSION -- NEWLY COVERED

00:39:25.162 --> 00:39:26.330
INDIVIDUALS WILL STILL BE

00:39:26.397 --> 00:39:28.332
ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE FEDERAL

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:28.866
SERVICES THEY'RE CURRENTLY

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:29.834
OFFERED.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.602
SO WE WILL BE DRAWING DOWN SOME

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:33.571
FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THOSE BUT ALL

00:39:33.637 --> 00:39:35.272
OF THE SERVICES AND ACCESS TO

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:36.774
RESTRICTED CODES GO RESTRICTED

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:38.275
SCOPE COVERAGE THAT MAKE IT FULL

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:40.778
SCOPE COVERAGE -- WOULD BE

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:42.546
FUNDED BY THE STATE GENERAL FUND.

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:45.816
OKAY SO -- BUT NORMALLY.

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:47.518
A PEOPLE IN THAT AGE RANGE THAT

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:49.520
WE PUT ON MEDI CAL ARE ELIGIBLE

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:51.055
FOR AT LEAST A 50% FEDERAL FUND

00:39:51.122 --> 00:39:52.556
MATCH RIGHT IF NOT SOMETIMES

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:54.325
MORE DEPENDING ON WHO THEY ARE

00:39:54.391 --> 00:39:56.427
AND AND WHAT THEIR ISSUES ARE.

00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:57.962
THAT WAS ALRIGHT I BELIEVE JUST

00:39:58.028 --> 00:40:00.831
FOR THOSE VERY LIMITED SERVICES

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.199
THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE.

00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:03.734
OKAY SO WHAT WOULD BE WRONG TO

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:05.236
SAY THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WORK

00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:06.637
SPENDING MEDI CAL TO ARE COSTING

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:07.972
THE STATE TWICE AS MUCH PER

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:10.307
CAPITA IS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:40:10.374 --> 00:40:11.709
ALREADY COVERED BY MEDICARE.

00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:13.043
I'M NOT SURE THAT IT WORKS OUT

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.179
EXACTLY TO TWICE AS MUCH AGAIN

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.514
BECAUSE THERE IS SORT OF A AN

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.082
EFFECT WHERE THE INCREASED

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:20.084
CASELOAD -- WITH PEOPLE COMING

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:21.585
INTO THE PROGRAM THAT NEW

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:23.521
POPULATION WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO

00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:25.356
DRIVE DOWN THE MATCH FOR THOSE

00:40:25.422 --> 00:40:26.490
RESTRICTED SERVICES.

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:28.058
BUT I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:29.293
YOUR POINT IS RIGHT THAT THAT

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.728
THE STATE GENERAL FUND WOULD

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:33.430
COVER A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE --

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:35.599
PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL COSTS

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:37.668
COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:40.137
