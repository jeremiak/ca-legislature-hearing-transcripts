00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:05.742
IN JUNE OF NINETEEN NINETEEN IN

00:59:05.808 --> 00:59:07.377
JUNE OF NINETEEN NINETEEN THE

00:59:07.443 --> 00:59:07.977
SENATE VOTED ON THE AMENDMENT

00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:09.545
GIVEN THEM GIVING THE WOMEN THE

00:59:09.612 --> 00:59:10.346
RIGHT TO VOTE.

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:11.981
THE VOTE CAME AFTER FOUR HOURS

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:13.616
OF DEBATE.

00:59:13.683 --> 00:59:14.984
DURING WHICH SOME DEMOCRATIC

00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:16.753
SENATORS OPPOSE THE AMENDMENT

00:59:16.819 --> 00:59:18.922
AND TRIED TO FILIBUSTER. TO

00:59:18.988 --> 00:59:20.456
PREVENT IT FROM GETTING TO ROLL

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:20.723
CALL THAT.

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:23.092
THAT.

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:25.561
THAT FAILED CLEARLY.

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:26.763
THE STATE SEN HAD TO RATIFY HE

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.498
NEEDED TWO THIRDS TO DO SO BUT

00:59:28.564 --> 00:59:31.634
THEY WERE ONE STATE SHORT.

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:34.103
THE SOUTHERN STATES WERE OPPOSED

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:35.939
OKAY SO YOU HAD TO MEMBERS OF

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:37.273
CONGRESS SHE SAID WE CAN COUNT

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.541
ON THE SOUTHERN STATES WE KNOW

00:59:38.608 --> 00:59:39.809
THEY WON'T VOTE FOR IT.

00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:41.477
SO WE IF WE JUST PUT THIS UP TO

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:43.379
THE STATE'S THEMSELVES WE SAY

00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:44.881
THE STATE SHOULD HAVE THIS RIGHT.

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:46.616
THEN WE DON'T WANT PASS.

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:48.451
THE EFFORT TO LEAVE IT UP TO THE

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:49.786
STATE'S THOUGH AB DIDN'T FLY

00:59:49.852 --> 00:59:52.188
WITH CONGRESS.

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:54.324
SO IT CAME DOWN TO TENNESSEE.

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:56.993
TENNESSEE OF ALL STATES.

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.795
IN THE VOTE WAS FORTY EIGHT TO

00:59:58.861 --> 01:00:01.264
FORTY EIGHT FOUR IN A POST.

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:02.732
AND ONE VOTE.

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:04.167
PUT IT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:05.301
AND THAT WAS FROM TWENTY THREE

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:06.636
OR TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:08.705
REPUBLICAN HARRY T. BURN.

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.139
WHO WAS NOT?

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:12.809
COMPLETELY SOLD ON THE IDEA BUT

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.510
HIS MOTHER HELPED CONVINCE HIM

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:15.878
TO SUPPORT THE ISSUE.

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:17.447
SO I WOULD SAY ALWAYS LISTEN TO

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:18.514
YOUR MOTHER PARTICULAR IN CASES

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:20.783
LIKE THIS.

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.018
I HOPE MY KIDS ARE LISTENING --

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:24.921
SO IT TOOK MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:26.689
THOUGH FOR THE TWELVE REMAINING

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:30.426
STATES TO OFFICIALLY RATIFY.

01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:31.861
THIS AMENDMENT.

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:33.129
THE LAST TO STATE TO DO SO WAS

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:39.268
MISSISSIPPI IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:39.869
FOUR NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR IT'S

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:40.470
KIND OF ASTONISHING TO THINK

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:43.106
THAT.

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:44.474
OVER THE WEEKEND CAL MATTERS PUT

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.708
OUT A VERY INTERESTING ARTICLE I

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:46.676
DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAD A

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:47.643
CHANCE TO READ IT BUT I JUST

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:48.478
WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:49.779
THE THINGS THAT THEY NOTING HERE

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:50.747
WHICH I THOUGHT WERE.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.081
KIND OF FASCINATING AND IN

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:53.816
SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW ROSEANNE

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:55.685
VOYAGE A DAUGHTER OF YUGOSLAV AN

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.754
INGRID IMMIGRANTS FROM A TINY

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.222
TULARE COUNTY TOWN.

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:00.590
BROKE THE GENDER BARRIER IN THE

01:01:00.656 --> 01:01:03.726
UPPER HOUSE HERE IN.

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:04.360
NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX BEFORE HER

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:07.063
THERE HAD BEEN MORE THAN TWELVE

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:07.897
HUNDRED HUNDRED SENATE ELECTIONS

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:09.365
ADDED TAKEN PLACE.

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:11.834
SINCE STATEHOOD AND MEN HAD ONE

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:12.668
ALL OF THEM.

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:15.671
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:18.107
SO ROSANNE ONE AND THE MEN OF

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.176
THE SENATE WERE UNSURE OF HOW TO

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:22.345
HANDLE THEM A WOMAN'S PRESENCE

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:23.413
AND SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:24.647
GREETED WITH NOTHING LESS THAN

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:27.316
SHOCK WHICH DOES NOT SURPRISE ME.

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:29.352
SO SHE BROUGHT A SMALL PORCELAIN%

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:30.019
BELL WITH HER AND KEPT IT AT OUR

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:31.521
DESK WHENEVER ONE OF HER

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:33.322
COLLEAGUES BEGIN A FLOOR SPEECH

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:35.425
WITH GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE.

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:36.492
ROSEANNE WOULD RING HER LITTLE

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:39.629
BELL TO REMIND THEM THAT A LADY

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:42.432
WAS PRESENT IN THE HOUSE AS WELL.

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:43.733
TWO YEARS LATER DIANE WATSON

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.168
BECAME THE SENATE FIRST FEMALE

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:47.570
AFRICAN AMERICAN SENATOR.

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:49.405
AND I CAMPAIGN BUYS ADVISER OF

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:51.941
HERS RECALLED TAKING WATSON ON A

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:53.076
MEET AND GREET WITH OTHER BETTER

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:55.178
IN LEGISLATORS AND ONE OF THESE

01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:56.312
VETERAN LEGISLATORS PULLED HIM

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.881
ASIDE AND SAID. TWO WOMEN IS

01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:00.416
ENOUGH.

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.452
SO THAT WAS THE ATTITUDE THAT.

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:03.519
WE KNOW THAT THE STRUGGLE FOR

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:04.587
WOMEN'S RIGHTS MAY HAVE BEEN

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:05.855
LONG AND FRUSTRATING BUT IT WAS

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:07.423
CERTAINLY IN OUR COUNTRY'S BEST

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:08.391
INTEREST.

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.126
AFTER FORDING WOMEN THE SAME

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:11.494
RIGHTS AS MEN.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.262
WE SAW MANY OTHER ISSUES OF

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:15.431
EQUALITY.

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:16.699
PASSED THROUGH OUR LEGISLATURE'S

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.768
WE SAW THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WE

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:20.036
SAW THE EQUAL PAY ACT WE SAW THE

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:21.204
BEGINNING OF EMPLOYMENT

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:22.672
DISCRIMINATION BASED ON YOUR

01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:23.940
RACE OR SEX RELIGION OR YOUR

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:25.775
GENDER.

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:26.342
AND IF YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:27.610
REMEMBER.

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:29.812
AS I AM IN NINETEEN SEVENTY

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:31.347

MATCH BECAUSE HE SAID THE

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:38.421
WOMEN'S SPORTS DIDN'T MATCH UP

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:41.724
