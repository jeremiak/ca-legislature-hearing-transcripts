THE DIRECTLY THE ITEM TO SB TWENTY EIGHT- DISCOVER YOUR IF YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR SANTIAGO AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB TWENTY EIGHT A BILL THAT WILL ENSURE CALIFORNIA TWENTY ONE YEARS INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CAN CLOSE OUR DIGITAL DIVIDE PROVIDE ROBUST DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALL COMMUNITIES WHILE ENSURING NO CALIFORNIAN FACES DISCRIMINATION IN ACCESSING. IT ACCESSING THAT DIGITAL NETWORK FIRST I WANT TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE GRATITUDE TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF WHO WORK DILIGENTLY WITH MY STAFF ON THE RECOMMENDED COMMITTEE AMENDMENT I WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS SET FORTH IN THE ANALYSIS. FIRST SB TWENTY EIGHT PUT STATE ASSETS TO WORK IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES THE CPUC DGS THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY CALTRANS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES TO INVENTORY STATE RESOURCES THAT CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AT MINIMUM DOWNLOAD SPEEDS OF A HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND. SB TWENTY EIGHT PASSED THE STATE TO CREATE A LICENSE AGREEMENT SO THAT THE STATE CAN READILY CONTRIBUTE THESE RESOURCES TO INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ANY PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EFFORT. IT TAKES A BROAD VIEW OF STATE RESOURCES INCLUDING REAL PROPERTY THAT COULD BE USED TO SITE BROADBAND EQUIPMENT. RIGHT TO RAISE IT COULD BE USED FOR ROUTING FIBER AND EVEN WIRELESS SPECTRUM THAT COULD BE USED FOR BANDWIDTH CAPACITY. SECOND SB TWENTY EIGHT AMENDS FOR THE FIRST TIME A STATUTE CALLED THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE VIDEO COMPETITION ACT. OF TWO THOUSAND SIX OR DEFECT. DIFFICULT PROVIDES CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES WITH THE STATE WIDE. TEN YEAR LONG FRANCHISE LICENSE TO DEPLOY A DIGITAL VIDEO SERVICES. PRIOR TO DATE DIFFA FRANCHISE HOLDERS HAD TO NEGOTIATE WITH EACH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO GAIN SUBSCRIBER ACCESS INTO SERVICE TERRITORY. THIS REQUIRED OVER FOUR HUNDRED SEPARATE SEPARATE AGREEMENTS ACROSS THE STATE I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL AT THE TIME. THAT WE HAD THE AUTHORITY IN THE POWER TO NEGOTIATE. THEY'VE CUT ENDED THAT REQUIREMENT AND PROVIDED ONE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE STATEWIDE LICENSE WHICH INCLUDES DEFINED RULES FOR ACCESSING EASEMENTS AND RIGHTS OF WAY THIS IS WORTH. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND IT'S ONE FRANCHISE. ADDITIONALLY DIFFICULT FRANCHISEES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN REQUIRED TO BUILD THEIR DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THEIR SERVICE TERRITORY AREAS TO ALL HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION AND IN A REASONABLE TIME FRAME. AND THE STATUE CREATED DIFFERENT RULES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROVIDERS DEPENDING ON THEIR TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO SPUR COMPETITION SO THAT COMPANIES JUST ENTERING THE DIGITAL VIDEO MARKET PLACE WOULD REACH FISSURED PERCENTAGES OF THEIR SERVICE AREAS WITHIN JUST A FEW YEARS. IT IS NOW BEEN FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS SINCE DIFFICULT PAST SB TWENTY EIGHT REFORMS DISCUSSED SO THAT ALL FRANCHISE HOLDERS FACE THE SAME SIMPLE REQUIREMENT TO NOT DISCRIMINATE IN DETERMINING WHO HAS ACCESS TO AN ADVANCED DIGITAL NETWORK. IN OTHER WORDS SB TWENTY EIGHT UPDATES THE STATUTE TO BE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AS TO HOW ONE DIFFICULT FRANCHISE HOLDERS TREATED COMPARED TO ANOTHER I CONTINUES THE ANTI DISCRIMINATION AND TIMELY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS. THE CPRE C. HAS THE TASK OF REVIEWING FRANCHISE FRANCHISEE COMPLIANCE WITH THE FACT AS THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE THAT HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED SINCE THE CPUC DOES NOT RECEIVE SUFFICIENT SELF REPORTED DATA. TO KNOW IF CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES IN A NON DISCRIMINATORY. NON DISCRIMINATE MANNER SB TWENTY EIGHT REFORMS DIFFICULT REQUIRING THE- GRANULAR DATA TO BE REPORTED TO THE C. P. U. C. SO THAT FINALLY THE STATE WILL HAVE AN ACCURATE ACCOUNTING OF WHO IS RECEIVING SERVICE. AND WHO IS NOT GAINING THIS ACCURATE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK NETWORK MAP IS CRITICAL CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA SO LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A REAL QUICK. EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT INA IN A VISUAL FASHION BECAUSE I'M A VISUAL PERSON I LIKE TO SEE PICTURES AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE THIS AVAILABLE. FOR EVERYONE BUT I'VE GOT SOME MAPS THAT I'D LIKE TO IF YOU COULD SHARE- WE CAN WE CAN PASS THEM OUT BUT. SO. HARD TO SEE BUT HERE'S A MAP WITH SOME NAMES OF SOME CITIES AND THIS IS FRESNO AND WE WORKED WITH- AN ORGANIZATION IN FRESNO THEY GAVE US SOME REALLY GOOD DATA. SO THAT THESE COMPANIES HAVE COME IN AND SAID THEY PICK THEIR SERVICE AREA. SO IF YOU LINE UP THE NAMES OF THE CITIES. HERE'S A SERVICE AREA IN FRESNO EVERYTHING IS COLORED. BASED ON DIFFERENT COMPANIES RIGHT SO IT'S FRESNO CLOVIS SINGER READ ME SELMA KINGSBURG IT'S A IT'S A BIG AREA SOME OF IT IT'S REALLY EXTREMELY RURAL. THIS IS WHAT THIS GIVEN THIS TO THE CPUC. AND IF YOU LOOK AT IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY'S GETTING SERVICE. WHEN IN REALITY. THIS IS THE INFORMATION THAT IS PRESENTED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AGAIN I'M LINING UP THE CITIES AND THE PURPLE SHOWS YOU WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS RECEIVING IN REGARDS TO INTERNET SERVICE AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S STARTING TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT LIKE SWISS CHEESE AND THE QUESTION BECOMES. IN THIS PICTURE WHAT ARE THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT RECEIVING SERVICES. AND THERE AND WHY ARE THEY NOT RECEIVING THE SERVICES. WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS MORE GRANULAR INFORMATION IN THIS. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS TELL US WHO GET AND BY HOUSEHOLD WHO'S GETTING THE SERVICE AND WHO ISN'T BECAUSE IF IN FACT THE IMPACT OF PROVIDING THE SERVICE IS DISCRIMINATORY AND IS LEAVING OUT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHICH IN MANY INSTANCES MAY BE THE SAME. THEN THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY. THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN MY **** ARE PROHIBITED FROM FROM THEIR FRANCHISE AGREEMENT FROM DOING THAT AND THE REASON THIS BECOMES IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE IF WORD TOLD ALL THE TIME HEY LOOK IF. WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB HOW DOES THE C. P. U. C. DECIDE HEY WAIT A MINUTE YOUR FRANCHISE AGREEMENT- SAYS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING A LITTLE BIT BETTER IN YOUR NOT SO WHY. SO THE OTHER THING THE BILL DOES. IS IT. IT PUTS LOCAL GOVERNMENT BACK AT THE TABLE WHEN DIFFICULT WAS INSTITUTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH CUT OUT THERE'S NO PLACE IN A PROCESS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT HOULD BE INVOLVED BUT UNDER THIS BILL IT BASICALLY SAYS WHEN THE C. P. U. C. IS LOOKING AT YOUR FRANCHISE AGREEMENT TO SAY DO YOU GET ANOTHER TEN YEARS. THE CITIES. GET TO LOOK AT THE INFORMATION. OR THE COUNTIES AND DETERMINE PUNE. I THINK THEY'RE REALLY HITTING THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY BUT NOT THE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T. AND SO THEY NEED TO BE AT TE TABLE SO THERE'S A DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER THE DIFF COLLECTION SLICES. SHOULD BE- INCLUDE IT SHOULD SHOULD BE RENEWED FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS TEN YEARS IS A LONG TIME. AND SO IT'S THIS IS. THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS BASICALLY TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET DATA TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE WITH A SEAT AT THE TABLE BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHICH COMMUNITIES ARE THE COMMUNITIES ARE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE. ISSUES WITH ACCESS- AND IT IT IT- IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A DIALOGUE AND A DISCUSSION ABOUT WERE WE GOING TO DEPLOY. REALLY LIMITED STATE RESOURCES BECAUSE THERE ARE A MY BILL DOESN'T SAY WHERE THE STATE RESOURCES OUT AGO. BUT THERE ARE STATE RESOURCES WERE I'M BETTER BEING DEPLOYED THE ASSEMBLY HAS A COUPLE OF GOOD BILLS THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT. ABOUT THAT SERVICE FUND- WE DON'T KNOW. WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DEPLOY THEM AND WHERE DO WE HAVE HOLES- AND LET ME JUST SAY IN ADDITION. THAT THERE ARE PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS. ON WHERE. ACCESS CAN BE PROVIDED THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE BARRIERS RIGHT THEY BECOME VERY VERY EXPENSIVE WE'RE NOT SAYING THEY HAVE TO DO IT. IF IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE THAT'S THAT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSION RIGHT- MAYBE THERE'S A WAY THAT THE STATE CAN BE A PARTNER BUT BUT WE NEED WE NEED TO KNOW AND WE NEED TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AND SO- THE KEY HERE IS THAT. SB TWENTY EIGHT MAKE SURE THAT OBLIGATIONS ARE BEING KEPT AND THAT THE LACK OF ACCESS TO ADVANCED DIGITAL NETWORKS IS NOT BASED ON DISCRIMINATION OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT WILL KEEP THEM FROM. THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY REQUIREMENT THAT WE ALL HAVE INTERNET I MEAN YOU VIEW SIDE DURING THE PANDEMIC WHAT WHAT- HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS SO THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS TODAY AND TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT- IS KIMBERLY BALLOT THIS IS A CONSTITUENT FROM THE TOFF SENATE DISTRICT- AND JEFF NEAL FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES.

THANK YOU AND THE MISTER NEIL. MODERATOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CHECKING ON HIM. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JEFF NEAL HERE BUT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY THANK YOU TO SEND OUR COPIER- FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE THEM AS SHE NOTED IT WOULD MAKE IMPORTANT REFORMS TOO DIFFICULT WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND HAS NOT BEEN SUBSTANTIVELY. WE EXAMINED ST STE- DESPITE THE MANY CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE BUSINESS MODELS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THAT TIME. UNDER THE TERMS OF DIFFICULT WHICH IS- THE CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS FOUGHT VERY HARD FOR THAT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO- UNDER THOSE TERMS THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHICH SERVICES TO PROVIDE IN DIFFERENT AREAS EVEN WITHIN ONE- JURISDICTION- INSTEAD OF NEGOTIATING WITH COUNTIES AND CITIES OVER THE TERMS OF SERVICE. THOSE COMMUNITIES NEEDS- MAKE IT TO DECIDE WHO GETS SERVICE AND WHO GETS LEFT BEHIND- SO SB TWENTY EIGHT WOULD FIX THIS BY ASKING A COUPLE YEARS SAID RETURNING LOCAL AGENCIES TO A SEAT AT THE TABLE ALL IT DOES IS A HOLD AT LEAST COMPANIES TO THE STANDARD THAT THEY FOUGHT SO HARD FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THIS IS THE DEAL. THAT DAY- THAT THEY WANT AND NOW THEY'RE OBJECTING TO- BEING TOLD THAT THEY ACTUALLY NEED TO LIVE UP TO THEIR END OF THAT BARGAIN BAKER RETHINK CREDIBLE REWARDS AND YET DESPITE- DESPITE THAT THERE'S STILL A NEARLY QUARTER MILLION PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITHOUT- WITHOUT INTERNET SERVICE THERE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SAMBAR DINO COUNTY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE IN SAN DIEGO AND RIVERSIDE IN ORANGE OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. NOT ONLY THAT BUT THERE ARE FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE WHO ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO ONE BROADBAND PROVIDER. I KNOW THIS BILL IS ABOUT ALL THE DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS NOT JUST BROADBAND- BUT WE'VE WE'VE SEEN JUST HOW. THE LINKS TO- WHICH SHOULD ARRIVE AND THEY'LL GO TO PRESERVE AND THEIR ABILITY TO GET. THE SERVICES WHO GETS LEFT BEHIND- AND- GET MORE THAN NIGHT. ALSO THANK FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND- APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NOW WE HAVE. TO OPPOSITE- TESTIMONIES- FIRST MODERATE IF YOU COULD HELP ME FIND- MISS MCINTYRE. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CAROLYN MCINTYRE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO ASK THE TWENTY EIGHT- IF I COULD START MY TESTIMONY BY MAKING CLEAR AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT GIVE PASSED IS A LOG THAT FOCUSES ON THE AUTHORITY FOR A COMPANY TO PROVIDE VIDEO. CABLE AND VIDEO APARTMENT EVERYTHING NOT ALL I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE PROVISION OF BROADBAND SERVICE IT DOES IN FACT GOVERN WHERE THE COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR VIDEO SERVICE WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THAT THE AUTHOR HAS AGREED TO ACCEPT. WE WOULD LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO REVIEW THOSE AMENDMENTS HOWEVER WE NOTE THAT WHILE THERE IS A AN AMENDMENTS THAT ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT THE STATUTE TO BE A PRIORITY THAT IS GRANTED TO THE STATE. BY THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT LANGUAGE THAT WOULD TOLD SPECIFICALLY PROHIBIT A STATE ENTITY FROM ATTEMPTING TO THAT RATE- WAS NOT REINSTATED IN THE LEGISLATION I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE BILL DOES IN FACT ALLOW THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AS THE ISSUE ARE AT THAT VIDEO. FRANCHISE TO IMPOSE THE BUILD OUT REQUIREMENTS YET IT FAILED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION SITUATIONS WHERE A COMPANY NEVER INTENDED TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO THAT AREA AS IS THE CASE FOR ONE OF OUR MEMBERS. IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA AND THE STATE OR AND TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN A COMPANY IF I'M ABLE TO OBTAIN. THE NECESSARY PERMITS. YEAH CAN BETTER IS A OF THE LAW AND IT HAS BEEN. FROM THE PER THAT ATHLETES EIGHT IMPORT. THE AUTHOR HAS TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE REPORTING OF DATA TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FOR PURPOSES OF ENSURING THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AS TO WHERE BROADBAND SERVICES AVAILABLE. I KNOW THAT THAT WAS PLACED IN A SEPARATE SECTION AWAY FROM THE DESK OF PROVISIONS YES. IT ONLY WOULD REQUIRE DISTAFF FRANCHISEES TO REPORT THAT INFORMATION TO THE COMMISSION AND I WANT TO BE SPECIFIC BUT SOME OF THAT INFORMATION NOT ONLY INCLUDES WHERE WE PROVIDE CARE METHOD BUT THE SPEED AT WHICH WE PROVIDE CARE WITH THE COCKPIT WHICH WE PROVIDE THEM WITH. A LOT OF BUSINESS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION YET IT IS ONLY LIMITED TO ONE TYPE. INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER DOES THE FACT THAT ALSO HAPPENED TO PROVIDE. VIDEO PARAMEDIC- IN TERMS OF REPORTING I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD IMPROVE UPON WHAT THE SENATOR STATES HER GOAL IS WHICH IS TO HAVE ACCURATE MAPPING I WILL BROADBAND FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE AND- WHAT. ARE SEEN. BY THE COMPANIES THAT WE HAVE POSTED BAIL AND. WE REQUEST YOUR NOW ABOUT. THANK YOU MISSPENT ARE NOW WILL BLOOM. ASIDE PRIMARY TO AND PHONE- MODERATELY. YES THEIR LINES ARE OPEN. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MA'AM. BUT THERE. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO AND MEMBERS MARK GRAHAM ON BEHALF OF KEEP CELL ANTENNAS AWAY THE STATE SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES OF WIRED INTERNET ACCESS OVER WIRELESS CABLE COMPANIES HAVE A FEDERAL FRANCHISE TO OPERATE AND THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE THE TERMS OF THAT FRANCHISE THE STATE CANNOT DO THAT THE BILL ALSO THREATENS TO TAKE AWAY THEIR FRANCHISE UNLESS THEY COMPLY WITH CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. YOU CANNOT DO THAT EITHER. THE STATE POLICY SHOULD BE THAT ANY COMPANY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO FIBER OPTIC CABLES. BOB SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE SERVICE USING THOSE CABLES. THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THE INCENTIVE TO LAY THOSE CABLES THIS BILL FAILS TO DO THAT. IF THE STATE GOAL TO ENABLE UNIVERSAL HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS BY WIRELESS. ACCORDING TO THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY RULES FOR FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS THIRTY ONE CFR PART THIRTY FIVE THIS IS CALLED CORONAVIRUS STATE AND LOCAL FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS- PAGE SIXTY NINE. IT SAID THE INTERIM FINAL RULE PROP PROVIDE THAT ELIGIBLE INVESTMENTS IN BROADBAND ARE THOSE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SERVICES MEETING ADEQUATE SPEEDS. AND ARE PROVIDED TO UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES. UNDER THE INTERIM FINAL RULE ELIGIBLE PROJECTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE DESIGNED TO DELIVER UPON PROJECT COMPLETION SERVICE THAT RELIABLY MEET OR EXCEED SYMMETRICAL UPLOAD AND DOWNLOAD SPEED OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION. MEGABYTES PER SECOND. WIRELESS CANNOTDO THAT ONLY WIRED CAN. ALSO FROM THIS TREASURY REPORT I QUOTE EVEN IN AREAS WHERE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. BECAUSE IT IS ON AFFORDABLE END QUOTE. THAT ANSWERS THE OFFICE QUESTION OF WHY CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE NOT RECEIVING SERVICES MORE CELL ANTENNAS WILL NOT CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE STATE MUST BE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL THERE SHOULD BE NO SPECIAL FAVORS FOR THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY. MAKE YOUR CHOICES BASED ON THE ACTUAL SERVICE AND ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES. WIRELESS RADIATION IS HAZARDOUS TO HUMAN HEALTH CAUSE CANCER ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN AND I JOIN THE GENOMICS MISTER GRAHAM. ANYWHERE NEAR HOME. THE BEST WAY TO DELIVER HIGH SPEED INTERNET IS WITH FIBER OPTIC CABLES TO THE HOME. I URGE YOU TO VOTE FOR THAT AND ON THIS BILL THANK YOU MISTER GRAHAM MERRIMENT APPRECIATE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES- IN THE CHAMBER.

THANK YOU KNOW TAKE IT BACK TO COMMITTEE IF THERE'S ANY- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES I'M SORRY FIRST I APOLOGIZE. THIS ORDER BOERNER HORVATH BOERNER HORVATH TO DO BOTH TBH DAYS OUT OF THE H. SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK AND TAKING A LOT OF AMENDMENTS- I THINK IT'S VERY LAUDABLE TO HAVE A MORE DETAILED MAPPING OF WHEREVER PROVIDING VIDEO I THINK THAT IS THE INTENDED GOAL OF YOUR BILL AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT GOAL TO HAVE. A FINER GRAIN AND UNDERSTANDING WHERE- THE VIDEO SERVICE IS BEING ROLLED OUT I DO HAVE- AND IT'S ONE OF THE I THINK THE OPPOSITION WITH THIS PRODUCT WE HAVE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE AND SEE DIEGO THAT I HOPE YOU WILL ADDRESSING YOUR MEMBERS FOR THE NEXT COMMITTEE AND THAT IS **** COMMUNICATIONS GOES THROUGH CORONADO DOESN'T NEVER INTENDED TO HAVE ANY PROVISION OF SERVICE ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH CORONADO TO GET TO A MILITARY BASE DOWN THERE. SO IN THE DIFFICULT THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING THROUGH ALL THE. CENSUS TRACTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GET THEM. THEY NEVER INTENDED TO BUILD OUT. THEY PROBABLY WILL NEVER BUILD OUT SO I HOPE YOU CAN GIVE ME TO MAKE THAT ON THE LEFT IN YOUR NEXT COMMITTEE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A REAL ISSUE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THEIR INTENT TO EVER SAY. THAT WE WANTED TO BUILD OUT BUT YOU KNOW IT IS GOOD THAT WE HAVE A FINER GRAIN OF UNDERSTANDING OF. WHERE VIDEO IS AND WHAT IS INTENDED AND WHAT IS NOT INTENDED SO I HOPE THE AUTHOR. WILL CONSIDER THAT A MEMBER. AND ONE OF THE THINGS. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT IS. WHAT WE WANT THE CPUC TO AUTHORIZE. AND I WOULD PROBABLY BE HESITANT TO ALLOW SI PC. TO AUTHORIZED- REGULATION OF RATES. FOR VIDEO. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT AND WHAT IS YOUR INTENT ON THAT ISSUE IT WILL JUST GO THROUGH THE CHAIRS CUSTOMER. SORRY THROUGH THE CHAIR. IS W. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH- APPRECIATE THAT THAT THE QUESTIONS- AT THE BOTTOM LNE IS THAT IS THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR IS DATA IN THIS. IN THIS BILL AND ONE OF THE DATA POINT IS THE RATE CUT BUT WHAT THEIR- WHAT THEY'RE CHARGING ALONG WITH OTHER INFORMATION IT'S NOT. AT THERE'S NO ATTEMPT TO REGULATE IT AND TO SAY HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO AND WHAT YOU CAN'T DO THAT IS NOT PART OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. AND THE FINAL QUESTION- I DO HAVE AN ISSUE AROUND. I UNDERSTAND WE WANT TO SEE IF YOU SEE TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION SO WE HAVE. MORE GRANULAR PICTURE. OF WHERE VIDEO IS BEING USED OR NOT USED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF PRIVACY AND CONFIDENT ENOUGH PRIVACY CONFIDENTIALITY- TO. GIVING TO SEE IF YOU SEE THAT INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE NORMALLY YOU USE A RANGE OF SPEEDS RATHER THAN A SET SPEED- AND THAT IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THINGS VERY. AND THIS VARIAION OF PROVISION OF SERVICE SO I WOULD HOPE IN THE FUTURE AMENDMENT YOU WOULD BE CONSIDERING- THE CONFIDENTIALLY OP THE CONFIDENTIALITY ASPECT. OF THOSE SPEEDS FOR CONSIDER A RANGE THAT CAN BE GIVEN SO TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO LIABILITY ISSUES IN THE FUTURE. TO THE CHAIR. I APPRECIATE THAT- THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IN REGARDS TO THE- THE RANGE OF THE SPEECH AT THE SPEEDS- OBVIOUSLY THE SPEED IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE- IF YOU ARE IN I'M ABLE TO DO- ZOOM MEETINGS OR YOUR KIDS ARE AND IF- AND UNABLE TO. ACCESS THEIR EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT THE HIGH SPEEDS NECESSARY FOR THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM SO- A RANGE OF SPEECH MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE- AND- WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND I DO APPRECIATE HE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE- PHYSICAL BARRIERS IT'S NEVER INTENDED TO REQUIRE. THE COMPANIES TO HAVE TO OVERCOME PHYSICAL BARRIERS THAT CREATE A- COST THAT IS- WHEN BEYOND WHAT IS WHAT WHAT WHAT ONE WOULD THINK IT'S REASONABLE SO WE'RE VERY COGNIZANT OF THAT IN THERE MAYBE LANGUAGE WE CAN ADD THAT THAT- CLARIFIES OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE SO APPRECIATE. APPRECIATE COMMENTS. YES THANK YOU AND I WANNA APPLAUD THE AUTHOR IN THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AND UNDERSTANDING ESPECIALLY THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC THE NEED FOR EXPANDING ACCESS- I DO HOWEVER THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL'S DONE RIGHT AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES ACTUALLY COLLECTS- PRETTY DETAILED DATA I'M DOWN TO THE CENSUS BLOCK AND ADDRESS SO ISN'T THIS INFORMATION- DUPLICATIVE IF THIS IS A C. U. P. C. IS ALREADY COLLECTING THIS DATA OR IS THERE ADDITIONAL DATA THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY NOT COLLECTING- AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION. IS AROUND PREEMPTION IT'S BEEN- BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT THIS LAW COULD ACTUALLY- IS IT'S MOST LIKELY PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW SO HAS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL WAITED ON WHETHER OR NOT- THIS IS LEGAL AND WILL IT BE CHALLENGED IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS HAVE THIS- LEGISLATION AT YOU HAVE AND HAVE TO PUT RESOURCES IN- TO LEGAL- THE LEGAL. ACTION ON THIS BILL. THROUGH THE CHAIR. YEAH YOU MAY ANSWER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS I APPRECIATED VERY MUCH ON THE ISSUE PRESENT PREEMPTION- YES LEAD COUNSEL HAS LOOKED AT THIS AND THEY ARE VERY CAREFULLY CRAFTED THE LANGUAGE THAT WERE THAT WERE USING- IT DOESN'T KEEP YOU FROM GETTING SUED. BUT AT LEAST I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO IS TO THREAD A NEEDLE THAT THAT'S VERY FINE- AND- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES VERY- REGULATORY PROCESS AND WE DO OURS AND THEY'RE FOR DIFFERENT SERVICES ENTIRELY. AND SO WHAT WE FOCUSED ON THE ON THE ON THE CPUC- AND THE VIDEO CONFERENCING- ASPECT OF- OF THE- SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED- YOUR OTHER QUESTION- I HAD TO DO WITH DATA SO LET ME JUST SAY THAT- IS THAT THE FORM IN WHICH THAT THAT THE FORM IN WHICH THE DATA IS PROVIDED IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE DATA THAT THE CPUC IS GETTING RIGHT RIGHT NOW IS- IN A IN A FORMAT. THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE SERVICE AREA THAT THAT PARTICULAR COMPANY IS INTENDING TO SERVER TO SERVER AND SO THE FIRST MAP THAT I SHOWED YOU- AND I CAN GIVE YOU MY COPY OF IT SO YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT IS THE SERVICE AREA THAT THEY DECLARED AND IT IT'S NOT VERY GRANULAR IT'S VERY- BROAD AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS OKAY YOU'VE GIVEN US THE SERVICE AREA. THAT YOU WANT TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE TO BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE PROVIDING THE SERVICE THERE ARE NOT SO SHOW US THE DATA BECAUSE YOU HAVE IT AND YOU GIVE IT TO THE FCC SHOW US THE DATA IN A FORMAT WHERE WE CAN WE CAN DO AN OVERLAY AND WE CAN SEE WHERE ARE YOU ACTUALLY GIVING SERVICE AND WHERE HAVE YOU SAID YOU WANT TO BUT YOU HAVEN'T YET. AND THE REASON THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT IS THAT IF YOU'VE HAD THIS LICENSE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND- AND IF THE AREA THAT YOU HAVEN'T PROVIDED SERVICE YET WHY WHY IT'S EXPENSIVE TO DO BUILD OUT THEN THAT'S THAT WILL GIVE YOU TIME IS C. P. U. C. CAN SAY NUMBER OF THINGS BUT IF THE REASON IS. IF YOU THEN DRAW MAKE A MAP OF. THAT AREA AND IDENTIFY THE AREAS WHERE THE AT THE RATE OF POVERTY IS ABOVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE. AND THEY OVERLAP COMPLETELY THEN WE GOT A PROBLEM THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE GRANULARITY OF THE INFORMATION THEY PRODUCE IT FOR THE FCC THEY WE JUST ASKING THAT WE GET THE SAME KIND OF INFORMATION FOR THE PUC BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONES THAT GRANT THE LICENSE. AND THE LICENSE REVIEW BECOMES MEANINGLESS IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ABOUT INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO EVEN YOU KNOW MAKE IT IS A DETERMINATION OF HOW WELL THEY'VE DONE THEIR BUILD UP. FOLLOW UP CARE. YEAH SO AND- IF THIS IS ACTUALLY FOR THE OPPOSITION- CAN THE OPPOSITION SPEAK TO THE CURRENT- DATA THAT THE C. U. P. C. COLLECTS BECAUSE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT GETS A VERY GRANULAR IT GETS DOWN TO THE CENSUS BLOCK AN ADDRESS- AND I'M WONDERING IF THE OPPOSITION CAN WEIGH ON AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY PROVIDED AND WHAT CURRENTLY THE C. P. C. U. P. C. COULD PROVIDE. AND HOPE THE MISS MCINTYRE STILL ON MODERATOR COUNTY PLEASE FIND THIS MCINTYRE. I'M HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN. CAROL AMERICANS ARE HOPING YOU CAN HEAR ME- I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION CURRENTLY RETIRED GIFTED PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION BASED ON DEFENSIVE BLOCKS THAT WE INTEND TO PROVIDE SERVICE. THE INFORMATION THAT IS REQUIRED BY THE BILL IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY MORE GRANULAR THAN WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT. TO THE COMMISSION OR TO THE FCC AND THAT INCLUDES SPECIFIC RATE INFORMATION BUSINESS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. AND IT IS NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL IF SINGLED OUT ONE INDUSTRY AND REQUIRES US TO REPORT. SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS INFORMATION NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED ELSEWHERE AND DOES NOTHING TO ENHANCE BROADBAND MAPPING. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. I WOULD HAVE MISSED DAVIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY- QUESTION THAT BROADBAND IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST BIGGEST PRIORITIES WE HAVE COMING UP I DO HAVE- A COMMON IN A QUESTION THROUGH THE CHAIR OF COURSE- RIGHT NOW WHEN THE BIGGEST WE COULD SAY BARRIERS- CONCERNS ON IS THE DELAY WITH TRYING TO GET THESE PERMITS THROUGH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND SO MY QUESTION IS THAT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THE BILL REQUIRES THAT THE C. P. U. C. TO ACCESS DIFFICULT- TO BUILD OUT BUT IT REMOVES THE CURRENT LAW THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW THAT ALLOWS US CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS- DISASTERS INCLUDING ILDFIRES OR AGAIN- DELAYS ON GETTING PERMITS SO MY QUESTION IS- WHY REMOVED- I THINK IT WAS SECTION FIVE EIGHT NINE O. F. OF WITH THE CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW AND WOULD YOU BE IN CONSIDERATION OF PUTTING THIS BACK SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY MOVE THIS FORWARD. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT DELAYED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERMITS THANK YOU. FOR THE CARE. THANK YOU VERY THIRD THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I WILL I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT I DON'T. RECALL I DON'T REMEMBER ANY AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ACT IN THE WAY THAT YOU SUGGESTED BUT WE'LL TAKE A LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THAT SECTION. AND IF IT'S BEEN DONE IN ERROR WILL WILL FIX IT OBVIOUS OBVIOUSLY I THERE'S NO INTENT. TO STOP. THE EFFICIENCIES THAT ARE PART OF DIFFICULT. THERE WERE SOME THAT WERE WRITTEN IN SPECIFICALLY TO EXPEDITE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS- VIDEO CONFERENCING SO- I'M NOT INTERESTED IN IN STOPPING THAT. PRITCHETT YEAH JUST TO CLARIFY WHY I DON'T SEE THAT EITHER BUT THEY HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT BECAUSE I THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE INTENT AND I BELIEVE IS MISTER RODRIGUEZ RIGHT. YEAH ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU CENTER FOR- A BRING FOR ALL SEE THE PRESENTATION YOU GAVE TO US IS VERY EYE OPENING SPECIAL TO MAP YOU PROVIDED- AS WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS PANDEMIC IS REALLY- TAKE US TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL BUT- BECAUSE OF THAT AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA WE REALLY MUST LOOK ATHOW DO WE FIND THE WAYS TO EXPAND SERVICES. TO OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES- WELL ELECTED I PLAN SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE WORKING WITH OPPOSITION. AKHTER DRESSER ISSUES AND HOPEFULLY I GET A BETTER PRICE FOR EVERYBODY. BUT- THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN AND- CONTINUE WORKING THEIR OPPOSITION. THANKS THANK YOU I BELIEVE THAT ALMOST SUMS UP ALL THE COMMENTS OF THE GUN MISTER VICE CHAIR. THE HELP YOU CLOSE OUT. I THINK HIS CHAIR AND MEMBERS TO THE SENATOR- FIRST OF ALL I DO WANT TO. LET YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE. THE EFFORT HERE- YOU HAD MAPS OF THE AREA THAT I HAVE I WAS MAYOR FOR EIGHT YEARS- AND SERVE IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE- HOWEVER I DO. STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS- WITH THE BILL AND IT. NOT WITHSTANDING THEIR TESTIMONY- I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW. THIS IS THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT IT EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS FRANCHISING AUTHORITIES FROM REGULATING BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE. I HAVE REQUESTED AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED A LEGAL OPINION FROM THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S OFFICE REGARDING PREEMPTION AND EXPECT TO RECEIVE THAT OPINION FORMALLY AND IN WRITING SOON. BUT MEMBERS- MY ENTIRE BUSINESS AND BROADCAST LIVE WAS- IN RADIO AND THEN TELECOMMUNICATIONS- AND LOTS AND LOTS OF INTERACTION. NOT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BASED ON THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS ACT I HAVE ACCESS TO MY OWN- LAWYERS IN THIS SPACE. AND HAVE ASKED THEM. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AS WELL. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL REASON TO BELIEVE THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY REQUIRING A CABLE OPERATOR TO EXPAND BROADBAND SERVICE AS A CONDITION OF THEIR FRANCHISE. IS PREEMPTED. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I HOPE. THAT WE CAN GET TO A PLACE. WHERE WE BUILD OUT THE UNSERVED AREAS OF CALIFORNIA I HAVE BEEN. EIGHT YEARS IN THIS LEGISLATURE. AND AS VICE CHAIR OF UTILITY. AND THEN WE SPLIT OFF AT THE AT TO C. AND C. AS WELL THIS IS A SPACE THAT I HAVE CONTINUED. TO ASK THE QUESTION WHAT IS TAKING US SO LONG TO FINISH IT. BUT THERE IS NO PUBLIC GOOD. IN A BILL THAT ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT. IF IT INVITES LITIGATION. THIS BILL DOES INVITE THAT LITIGATION SO I'M GOING TO RESERVE MY VOTE ON THIS BILL UNTIL THE FORMAL LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S OPINION IN WRITING IS PRODUCED. AND ALL RESERVE MY VOTE FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONSIDERING OTHER LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL SO. THAT OPINION ON THIS WE HAVE STRONG REASON TO BELIEVE BASED ON MY CONTACTS WITH THE INDEPENDENT- LAWYERS YEAH- IN SPACE THIS SPACE THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CONCERN THAT THIS IS PREEMPTIVE. SO THE GOOD THAT WE TRY TO DO HERE MAY VERY WELL BE OFFSET BY A LITIGATION THAT IS EXPENSIVE. TIME CONSUMING AND UP. MIGHT HOLD UP THE EFFORTS WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. SO I'M GOING TO LAY OFF THE BILL. WHEN THE- LEGISLATIVE COUNCILS OFFICE PRESENTS ME WITH THE- FORMAL WRITTEN OPINION IT IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE- HAD EVERYBODY ELSE AND IN FACT I BELIEVE THAT THE- LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL- WE'LL OR HAS. NOTIFIED YOUR OFFICE OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF CREATING AN OPINION I DO BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT TO SLOW DOWN A BIT. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR LAWYERS WHO ARE SAYING THAT THIS IS. A PRODUCTION ISSUE IF WE GET A CONCURRING OPINION FROM BUDGET COUNCIL I THINK THAT OUGHT TO INSTRUCT. THE BILL AND HOW IT MAY BE AMENDED GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. YEAH THANK YOU IN AND THIS IS WHY THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WORKS IS BECAUSE PEOPLE CONTENT EVERYBODY CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION AND BUT WHAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST A RESULT I DO WANT TO DRESS AND JUST REITERATE THAT WE DID LOOK INTO THE ISSUE- PREEMPTION IN WHAT WE BELIEVE WE'VE- ROAD IN THE BILL AS AMENDMENTS AT THE AUTHOR TOOK ADDRESS THAT AND WE DID WORK WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. NOW AND I HAVEN'T SAID THAT BROADBAND IS YOU KNOW IS REGULATED- AND PREEMPTED BUT THE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY- THIS BILL WILL WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF VIDEO AND CABLE- WHICH ARE SEPARATE. FROM BROADBAND THAT THEN. AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT GRANULAR DATA WHICH IS FAR AND ABOVE WHAT THE CENSUS BLOCK DATA HASN'T AND THEY'VE BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY. BY THE GRAPHIC FOR OR MAP BY LAW BY LACK FOR LACK OF BETTER WORDS- BUT ALSO A REMINDER COLLEAGUES TO THAT THIS IS WHY THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO EXIST. TO CREATE LAWS THAT ARE. THAT INVENTED THAT ARE UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA WE JUST MEANT FOR YEARS- GOING IN ONE DIRECTION WITH LAWS THAT WE BELIEVE. I WAS EMPLOYED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ONE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AND SOYOU GOT WE CAN CREATE LONGER UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA. AT OR WHY WOULD WE HAVE LEGISLATURE- BUT HAVING SAID THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THAT THE AMENDMENT STRUCK HERE. ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES- AND I'M HAVING SAID THAT I WANT TO ST- THE ARCHER MAGNERS FONG. SURE THE TICKET PLEASE MATT. MY REQUEST IS AN OFFICIAL INFORM A FORMALIZED SPECIFIED REQUEST. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BILL AS PART OF THAT THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THE AMENDMENTS. AND IF IN FACT WHAT IS CLAIMED HERE IS FOUND TO BE SUPPORTIVE. IN THAT OPINION. I SEE TO THAT POINT BUT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT AMBIGUITY AND UNCERTAINTY. I HEAR THAT I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T WANT SOMETHING THAT IS LITIGATED. AND THAT. YOU SAY THE LEGISLATURE EXISTS WELL LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. EXISTS AND SO THIS IS A FORMAL BROAD. SPECIFIED REQUEST AND THEY ARE WORKING ON IT RIGHT NOW AND I TRUST THAT THEY WILL BE FAIR- AND- GIVE US THAT AS A GOOD OPINION- THE QUESTION IS THEN. DOES ALLEGE COUNCIL- HALF OF THOSE PREEMPTION CONCERNS AS DO THE PRIVATE LAWYERS AND I'VE CONSULTED N. AS THE LAWYERS FOR- SOME OF THE OPPONENTS. HAVE DEMONSTRATED- AND SO THAT'S WHY I AM LAYING OFF. I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE. WE CAN DO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THE AUTHOR SEEKS TO DO WITHOUT THE RISK OF LONG PROTRACTED LITIGATION AND I THINK WE INVITE THAT. IF WE'RE NOT VERY VERY CAREFUL. N. AND I APPRECIATE YOU DOING THAT AND THEN JUST GO TAKE A PER POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE I DON'T GO BACK AND FORTH IT'S NOT CUSTOMARY TO DO THAT- BUT- AND I AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IN GOOD SPIRIT TO DO SO. I'M OKAY WITH THAT. FIRST I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE- BEING ABLE TO. TAKE A LOOK AT- WHATEVER RESULT MAKEUP. BECAUSE WE ALL AGREE AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT WE- WE GO TO LET'S COUNCIL- FOR PEOPLE. AND WE ALL TEND TO AGREE THAT ONCE THEY MADE AN OPINION WELL WE AGREE OR DISAGREE ACOSTA- BUT KNOWING MY COMMENT IS THAT- I WAS LOOKING TOWARDS- THIS- TOWARDS- TOWARDS YOUR REQUEST OF LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL WHAT I WAS AYING. WAS THAT WHEN WE WERE CRAFTING THE AMENDMENTS WE ALSO- ASK LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL WHICH IS A VERY DIFFERENT THAN A DOZEN OPINIONS LEGISLATIVE pRESULT OF THE THURMOND. SENDING BOTH CAN EXIST- IT WOULD WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING THAT BUT- IN MY COMMENT ABOUT LET'S MAKE LAWS WE DO MAKE LAWS YOU KNOW IN THIS IS WILL BE HOSTED A CALIFORNIA- I TO LOOK FOR TODAY- TO THE TELECOM. AND LOOK AT WE'LL GO TO MY CONSCIENCE- BUT TODAY WHO WERE HERE BEFORE VOTING ON A BILL WHAT WE BELIEVE WE'VE WORKED ON IN THE AUTHOR HAS SPENT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME WITH OUR TEAM. ADDRESSING DIFFERENT ISSUES AND WORKING DILIGENTLY THROUGH THE DIFFERENT ITEMS AND THAT'S WHAT MY COMMENTS WERE MADE TO BE SO THAT I AT LEAST ADDRESS THAT YEAH WE DID WORK LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL IN OUR TEAM SPENT EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME- THE RESPECTIVE THEY CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION- AND THEN DOES THE LEGISLATURE- WE OFTENTIMES DO HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION WE'VE HAD A DIFFERENT OPINION WITH THE L. L. AS WELL. THAT'S WHY- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE VOTE THEY DON'T- TO HAVING SAID THAT- WE WOULD NEED A FIRST IN A SECOND- ON S. B- TWENTY. TWENTY EIGHT SORRY MY MASCOT STOPPED. I THOUGHT OUR FIRST FIRST MISTER BENNETT. SECOND SEMESTER OF BRINE- MAN FACT THIS IS THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED TO PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION- INSPECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

MISTER MCGUIRE WHENEVER YOU'RE PREPARED TO BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS- IN THE DEVICE CARE I'M HONORED TO BE WITH YOU AND I WANT TO. POINT OUT- INTO THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR INTO HIS AMAZING STAFF VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE ENGAGEMENT- IN FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL- MISTER CHAIR OF COURSE I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY AND GET RIGHT INTO IT TALK ABOUT WHAT THE HECK THREE FORTY ONE DIES. NUMBER ONE PROVIDES THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO CREATE BACKUP POWER RULES FOR CELL TOWERS LAND MINE OPERATIONS A CABLE PHONE SYSTEMS I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THOUGH THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH THE CURRENT PC PROCEEDINGS ON BACK UP POWER IN THE TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO BE ABLE TO CLARIFY THAT. NUMBER TWO IT MANDATES AT THE STATE OFFICE EMERGENCY FOOD SERVICES SHARES THE INFORMATION THEY ARE TO RECEIVE FROM TELECOM COMPANIES ON NETWORK OUTAGES TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THE REASON IS THIS THE DATA IS CRITICAL THE PC IS CHARGED WITH KEEPING THE NETWORKS UP AND RUNNING AND MAKING THEM MORE RESILIENT BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY. AT TO SEE THIS INFORMATION WHICH MEANS THEY CAN'T INSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE ENTIRE TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORK HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE AND WE ALL KNOW WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT. WE SITE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- WHERE WE HAD A POWER OUTAGE TO BUCKLE IN AT SPEAK NEARLY TWO MILLION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAD THEIR LAND LINE CELL PHONE AND CABLE SERVICE- INTERRUPTED. OUR PHONES THEY'VE NOW BECOME OUR LIFELINES IS HOW WE KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD AND HOW WE ARE ACTUALLY. RECEIVE EMERGENCY ALERTS. YET UP UNTIL THIS YEAR. OUR CURRENT TELE. SYSTEM ISN'T MANDATED TO HAVE BACK UP POWER. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THANKS TO THE HARD WORK I'VE YOUR CHAIR AND MEMBERS IN THISROOM. THE LEGISLATURE IN THE P. C. HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE OUR- TELECOMMUNICATION. NETWORKS ARE MORE RESILIENT AND THAT WE KNOW WHEN THEY ARE WORKING. THE PC IS RECENTLY ADOPTED DECISIONS FOCUS ON WIRELESS AS WELL AS WIRELINE- BACKUP POWER IN AGAIN THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH THOSE PROCEEDINGS- AND WE TOOK A MEANS IN THE SENATE TO BE A TO CLARIFY THAT- TELCO COMPANIES UNTIL WE TOOK LIMIT WERE INCREDIBLY CONCERNED. THAT THE BILL WOULD UPSET THOSE CURRENT BACKUP PROCEEDINGS. NOW A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE AND I PROMISE I'M GONNA WRAP UP- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN VIA SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY LEGISLATURE REQUIRED. TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO SUBMIT. AN OUTAGE NOTIFICATION TO- YES WHENEVER AN OUTAGE OCCURRED. IN LIMITS THE- THE BILITY TO MAKE NINE ONE ONE CALLS OR RECEIVE EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS. THIS INFORMATION GOES A CALLAWAY YES. NEVER MAKES IT TO THE P. C. IN BECAUSE THE PVC IS CHARGED WITH KEEPING. OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR THE UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE WEAKNESSES IN THAT SYSTEM EXIST. WITHOUT THE INFORMATION SI PC MUST RELY ON THE STAFF INITIATED REQUEST TO TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES. THAT AT TIMES AREN'T FILLED. FINALLY MISTER CHAIR- I WILL SAY THIS SB THREE FORTY ONE REQUIRE- YES. TO CREATE RULES ON OUTAGE MAPS FOR TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS TO REQUIRE THE PROVIDERS TO ABIDE BY THOSE RULES. ENSURING THAT THERE'S CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE BOARD. IT REALLY IS A COMMON SENSE BILL MISTER CHAIR TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS AND I'M GRATEFUL BY THE WAY MISTER CHAIR FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT. BOTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS AS WELL AS CABLE- AND ENSURES TO SEE PC. HAVE THE INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO KEEP OUR TELECOMMUNICATION. SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING IT'S SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA. PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS TO CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION STATE SHERIFFS ARE C. ARE SEEN TO BE WE HAVE. RAY GUIDE ON THE LINE HE'S THE FIRE CHIEF FOR THE CITY OF ONTARIO IN PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. WE'RE ALSO GRATEFUL TO HAVE COREY SAYS STILL ON THE LINE AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME MISTER CHAIR. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU NUMBER TO GO TO THE PHONE MODERATOR AND WE HAVE TO WITNESSES- MISTER GUIDE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHIEF. CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. AND THE MISTERS OF THE CELL IS- FROM- CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. I JUST WANNA REMIND YOU ALL THE WITNESSES AND THAT WE'RE DOING FOUR MINUTES ON EACH SIDE SUMMIT GENTLY- NO CHIU AT ABOUT TWO MINUTES. HI MODERATOR YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU IN OUR LINES ARE OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS INCLUDING MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER FREDDIE RODRIGUEZ MY NAME IS RAY GUY FIRE CHIEF IN THE CITY OF ONTARIO AND THE PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. DISASTERS AND POWER SHUT OFFS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE EMERGENCY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED FOR BOTH RESIDENTS AND FIRST RESPONDERS. WHETHER WE LOOK AT THE CAMPFIRE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN UP IN PARADISE OR THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NORTH BAY FIRESTORM GETTING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SAFELY EVACUATED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF A DISASTER. IS A LIFE OR DEATH AND ALL FIRST RESPONDERS IN OUR RESIDENTS NEEDS AND I'VE COME TO EXPECT OUR PHONES TO WORK ONE IS THAT HER STRENGTH. SB THREE FORTY ONE WILL IMPROVE OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS BY CREATING STRONGER OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS AND THE CALIFORNIA BROKE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. WHEN IT COMES TO THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES AND KOCKUMS POWER SYSTEMS. DURING THE POWER OUTAGES IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN NEARLY TWO MILLION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE THEIR LAND LINE CELL PHONE AND CABLE SERVICES INTERRUPTED. BUT SMALLER OUTAGES OCCUR IN A REPORT TO- YES DEMONSTRATING WEAKNESSES IN OUR EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION SYSTEM BUT THE CPUC HAS NO IDEA WHEN THEY'RE OCCURRING. SB THREE FORTY ONE WILL REQUIRE- YES THIS YEAR COMMUNITY ISOLATION OUTAGE INFORMATION WITH THE CPUC AND REQUIRES THE CPUC TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON ACTION TAKEN USING THE COMMUNITY ISOLATION OUTAGE INFORMATION. THE CPUC REGULATED TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE BACKUP POWER BUT IF THE TELCOS REPORT OUTAGES OF THEIR NETWORKS TO THE O. TWO OH YES. THE CPSC IS UNABLE TO FIND OUT IF THAT OUTAGE OCCURRED WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB THREE FORTY ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. MISTER TURNOVERS COREY CELLS ELLO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION- HAPPY TO BE IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE FORTY ONE AND IN THE SPIRIT OF BREVITY- IN YOUR VALUABLE TIME I WILL JUST KNOW THAT HAVING ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT NINE ONE ONE OUTAGES IS VITAL NOT ONLY THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRST RESPONDERS BOLSTERING OUTAGE MAP REQUIREMENTS WILL MAKE THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION MORE ACCESSIBLE AND IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY ENSURING TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE CORPORATE BACK ELECTRICAL SUPPLY TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE CONSUMERS CAN COMMUNICATE ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF DISASTER AND FIRST RESPONDERS ARE NOT IMPEDED FROM DOING THEIR VITAL WORK SB THREE FORTY ONE ALSO ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING PC IN CALLAWAY US TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT BACKUP ELECTRICAL SUPPLY RULES FOR THESE REASONS CSSA IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT- CENTER. MCGUIRE'S SB THREE FORTY ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU KNOW THE SHORTEST TESTIMONY AND OUR WOULD BE TO DO THAT. AND THEN- WE HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION TESTIFYING BY. PHONE MODERATE IF YOU COULD FIND- MISTER CARLSON OR MISS OR MISTER- OROVILLE. MISTER MISTER CHAIR THIS IS STEVE CARLSON- I'M ON THE LINE- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CENTER MCGUIRE US STEVE CARLSON FIFTY P. I. A WHERE THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING EXTREMELY CLOSELY WITH SENATOR MCGUIRE ON- ON THIS ISSUE FOR. THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND THE AND CLOSELY AND IN GOOD FAITH BOTH OF US- WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE ACT THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE- AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT- SENATE MCGUIRE IS TAKEN THEY HAVE ADDRESSED- SEVERAL OF OUR ISSUES WE HAVE PROVIDED- AT. A FAIRLY COMPLICATED AND- I MEAN COMPLETE SET OF AMENDMENTS TO- TO SENATE MCGUIRE WHICH WE CONTINUE TO- DISCUSS- WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE'RE TRYING TO WORK IT OUT SO THAT IT'S WORKABLE- FOR THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE TO IMPLEMENTED- ON THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO THE PC- WE- TO MAKE SURE. THAT INFORMATION IS DEALT WITH AS IT IS- PROVIDED WHICH IS ON PUBLIC SAFETY RELATED ISSUES. OUR CONCERN IS THAT WITH- YES PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION WHICH IS PURELY PUBLIC SAFETY RELATED- THAT IT NOT BE USED- ON THE BASIS OF SOME OTHER REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS. I WOULD THINK THAT'S A FAIR REQUEST- WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT TO OF MAINTAIN THAT INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL AND WE TAKE THE- COMMITTEE- THAT DID THE RIGHT THING THERE. ANOTHER ISSUE- WHERE THERE WE BELIEVE THERE IS SOME INCONSISTENCY WITH THE P. THINK THE BILLION PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO THE BILL- WHERE- THE- THE- PROVISION OF SERVICE FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS WHICH WE ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH THEM WHICH IS PART OF THAT. THE UC RESILIENCY ORDER- IS. BOB APPLIED IN THE TEARS MORE TO AND THREE FIRED. HERE'S BUT THE BILL APPLY THAT BROADLY WE THINK THERE'S AN CONSISTENT THERE AND- WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT. FINALLY THE WAY THE ISSUE IS DEALT WITH AT THE P. YOU SEE ON THE RESILIENCY ORDER IS THE PROVISION OF SERVICE FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS. UNFORTUNATELY SOME THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL APPEARS TO SUGGEST- THAT IF WE'RE GOING BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL IDEAS THAT EVERY CELL SITE HAD TO HAVE. A SEVENTY TWO OUR GENERATOR I THINK WE'VE ALL AGREED THAT THAT'S NOT LIKE NOT FEASIBLE BUT NOT NECESSARY- CARRIERS BUT THEIR NETWORKS TOGETHER. I'M MORE THEY HAVE A MAIN COVERAGE SITE AND THAT AFFECTED A PARTICULAR- ADJACENT SITE GOES DOWN THEY CAN OFFLOAD THAT WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE A GENERATOR ON EVERY SIDE. SO WE'D LIKE TO AND I AM ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE WITH THE- WITH THE CENTER STAFF I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THAT ISSUE JUST SO THAT THAT DOWN THE ROAD- THERE'S NOT A- THAT THERE'S NOT A- AND AMBIGUITY THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER. USING THE TERM BACKUP ELECTRICAL SUPPLY BECOMES- THE MATTER IN WHICH WE DO THIS WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT WAS INTENDED BUT WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT FINALLY. WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT AS THIS IS BEING DONE ON THAT STEAK ALL STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE HELP INCLUDING THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY. BUT WE APPRECIATE THE- OF THE WORK- SO FAR WITH LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THAT. WOULD CENTER MCGUIRE- AS THE. BILL MOVES TO ITS NEXT COMMITTEE THANK YOU.

HELLO MY NAME IS WHAT MUHAMMAD CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WILL RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORTER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU WILL GO IN THE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND MISTER BENNETT HAD- COUPLE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THIS CHAIR- OF THE FIRST TIME LIKE THANK OF THE SENATOR- FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BILL. AND THERE ARE MANY DESTRUCTION IN CALIFORNIA- THAT ARE WILL BE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY- THESE OUTAGES- I DO HAVE- TWO QUESTIONS- ONE THIS BILL REQUIRES SEVENTY TWO HOUR BACKUP OF ELECTRICITY- HAVE FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. OF THE BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE THE CPUC TO CHANGE THEIR EXISTING RULES ON THE ISSUE- SO COULD YOU CLARIFY WHAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS ON THE REQUIREMENTS FOR- THIS BACK UP INTO YOUR ONE TWO AND THREE FIRE HAZARD AREAS. AND ALSO THE QUESTION BROUGHT UP BY. THE OPPONENTS TODAY ABOUT. THIS IS A SEVENTY TWO HOUR BACKUP FOR EACH TOWER OR- SO IF YOU COULD HELP US WITH THAT PATIENT OR THE PATIENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH A SENATOR FOR THAT THAT QUESTION I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT SO LONG STORY SHORT LAST YEAR WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT FORWARD A BILL THAT WOULD- IMPLEMENT SEVENTY TWO HOUR BACKUP FOR. CELL PHONE TOWERS NOT ALL BUT TO BE A TO KEEP THE NETWORK RUNNING. BEING CANDID THE BILL- DIED- AND THEN THIS CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION PICKED UP THE ISSUE THEY ARE STUDYING IT IS WELL. THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AT TOWARDS THE END OF LAST YEAR MANDATED SEVENTY TWO HOUR BACKUP- FOR WIRELESS TOWERS IN IN EARLY THIS YEAR THEY MANDATED BACKUP FOR WIRELINE AND CABLE- THEY TOOK A BIT OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH IF I COULD BE HONEST WITH YOU- THAN WHAT WE TOOK. SO AB THE COMPANY PUBLIC CHOOSE COMMISSION TOOK A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH LOOKING AT ALL TOWERS- IS WELL AS A CABLE EQUIPMENT. AGAIN DIFFERENT APPROACH. OUTSIDE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH THOSE PROCEEDINGS- NUMBER ONE INDUSTRY. NCPC ARE ALIGNED ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE. SO OUR BILL AND WE TO CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS IN THE SENATE TO SAY THAT WE'RE NOT TOUCHING THOSE CURRENT PROCEEDINGS. WHICH MEANS- IN THE EXISTING CPUC PROCEEDINGS ARE IN TIER TWO TIER THREE. THAT'S WHERE THE MANDATES WILL FALL FOR BOTH WIRELESS AND WIRELINE BUT THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH- THAT PROCEEDING AND WE'RE TAKING- IN WHICH MEANS I WILL NOT IMPACT THAT OUTCOME. AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS COULD YOU JUST AT THE END OF DIESEL GENERATORS ARE. ARE LIKELY TO BE THE BACK UP AT THIS POINT TIME WHAT DO YOU SEE AND WHAT DO YOU HEAR FROM THE CPUC ABOUT EVENTUALLY MOVING FROM DIESEL GENERATORS SOMETHING MORE APPROPRIATE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. YEAH IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION THIS CAME UP A LOT LAST YEAR AS WELL SO I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE OUTGAINED GIVE YOU MY PERSPECTIVE AND- IN FULL DISCLOSURE ON A WORKING GROUP THAT WE ALSO HAVE ESTABLISHED. SO NUMBER ONE AND I DON'T EVER WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION BUT I'LL GIVE YOU MY OWN EDITORIAL I BELIEVE THE INITIAL ROLLOUT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE- BOTH FOR CABLE AS WELL AT TELCOS WILL BE DIESEL GENERATION REASON BEING IS. YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF TEMPORARY MOBILE GENERATORS PUTTING THE COMMUNITIES- AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE FASTEST TO DEPLOY- WHERE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WANTS TO GO IS LOOKING AT NON FOSSIL FUEL ALTERNATIVES. BUT WHERE THEY'RE MOVING NOW IS WITH SPEED IF WE HAVE ANOTHER SUMMER IN FALL THAT WE HAD IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- IT'S GONNA HAVE HONESTLY WILL ALL BE TO BLAME IN THIS ALONG WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SIR THEY'RE MOVING WITH SPEED AND YOU'RE GONNA SEE EVOLUTION OF THE EQUIPMENT. BATTERIES SOLAR PANELS YOU NAME IT HERE IN THE COMING YEARS BUT THE INITIAL DEPLOYMENT WILL EITHER BE TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT DIESEL WASTE TRANSITION HERE IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR THANK YOU SIR FIGURE IT OUT FOR THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OR QUESTIONS. FACING THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE CASES TODAY GREATLY APPRECIATED- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BUT I URGE THAT YOU WORK WITH OPPOSITION- LOT OF THE CALLS I GET WORD FROM SMALL COMPANIES AND THEIR CONCERN. OF LIABILITY- IN NOT HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY OR THE TIME TO ACTUALLY- GO AHEAD AND- YOU KNOW. PROVIDE THE- POWER NEEDED IN EMERGENCIES SO IF YOU WOULD PLEASE YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT YOU TAKE THE TIME. OBVIOUSLY WE WANNA MAKE SURE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE- SOLUTION- NOT TO BE FOR THE STATE BUT IT ALWAYS GOES DOWN THE CONSUMERS WE WANNA MAKE SURE THE SUIT CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO GET HIT WITH THE- INCREASE. ABSOLUTELY SO- WE'RE WORKING ON SPECIFICALLY. ON ISSUES RELATED THIS BILL WITH BOTH- WIRELESS WIRELINE ALONG WITH CABLE AS IN THROUGH MY ROLE AS GOVERNMENT AND FINANCE CHAIR IN THE SENATE WE'VE ALSO BROUGHT TOGETHER A WORKING GROUP WITH CABLE COUNTIES AND CITIES TO TALK ABOUT EXPEDITING DEPLOYMENT- IS WELL SO VERY ENTRENCHED IN THIS ISSUE AND YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT I WILL BE WORKING AT HAND INSIST ON THIS HERE IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME. IN I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU WOULD LIKE WITH ACTIVE HERE TO KEEP YOU UPDATED IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU IF YOU WERE WEARING GIANTS COLORS WHICH I'M EXCITED ABOUT. SO THERE YOU GO. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AND IF I'M NOT SEEING ANY OF QUESTIONS I LIKE TO HAND OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR. YEAH SURE THANK YOU- SENATE APPRECIATE- THE BILL AND THE ATTEMPT HERE. I WANTED JOIN MY- CALLING IN AND ASKING FOR YOU TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE ISSUES RAISED BY CTIA- BY THE OTHER- PROVIDERS AND OPERATORS HERE- THEY BRING TO THE TABLE- EXPERIENCE THEY BRING TO THE TABLE ABILITIES- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE ENHANCE AND FOSTER THEIR EFFORTS TO DO WHAT THE PC HAS- INDICATED WITH RESPECT TO THE BACK UP- AND SO I'LL BE VOTING. FOR TODAY- AT BUT AGAIN ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP IN COMMUNICATION AND TRY TO BESIDES THIS BILL AS IT GOES FORWARD I THINK WE'RE CLOSE AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME MEASURES THAT NEED TO BE- BE ROUGHED OUT.

L. A. COUNTY HAS A LARGE POPULATION OF FOSTER YOUTH IN ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE FOSTER YOUTH IN L. A. COUNTY. RESIDES IN MY SENATE DISTRICT. SO I'M VERY AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE FOSTER YOU FACE IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA IS VERY TROUBLING AND DISHEARTENING. THE CHANCES OF A FOSTER YOUTH GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL IS LESS THAN HALF OF A NORMAL STUDENT. THEIR GRADUATION RATE IN TERMS OF GETTING A BACHELOR'S DEGREES ABOUT 4% I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS DOESN'T HAVEHARD DATA. THEIR ESTIMATES IS THAT UP 220% OF THOSE INCARCERATED ARE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH.

LAUNCHED MID NOVEMBER IN TWENTY NINETEEN IN JUST A YEAR AND A HALF THIS LIFELINE PILOT HAS PROVIDED COMMUNICATIONS FOR THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO FIVE TO USE. MEETING THE NEEDS THAT 84% OF PILOT ELIGIBLE PARTIES. WE ALSO CONNECTED NEARLY TWO THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH WHO WERE NOT ELIGIBLE WITH FUNDING FROM CDS ACT AND PHILANTHROPY. SO NOT ONLY DO OUR YOUTH NOW HAVE ACCESS TO RELIABLE COMMUNICATIONS THEY'RE USING IT PILOT PARTICIPANTS USE THEIR PHONES FOR COMMUNICATIONS WITH FRIENDS FAMILY AND SUPPORT. FOR THE SCHOOLWORK EMPLOYMENT AND TELEHEALTH 1100% OF PARTICIPANTS AND FOSTER YOUTH SERVING AGENCIES BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE CONTINUED. WHICH IS WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT.
