ON THIS ISSUE ACTUALLY DID NOT

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:13.958
REALLY COME TO LIGHT UNTIL LATE

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:16.160
MARCH -- WHEN THE WORKING GROUP

00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:17.561
REALLY HAS BEEN TURNING FROM ONE

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:19.130
DEPARTMENT TO ANOTHER IN OUR

AND TOOK IT TO THE HOMELESS

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:26.804
COURTING IN FINANCING COUNCIL IN

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:29.240
OUR APRIL MEETING -- AND WE WE

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:31.142
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SUFFICIENT

00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:32.710
TIME TO BRING IT TO THE POLICY

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:34.211

DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR THAT

00:38:41.652 --> 00:38:42.119
I COULD COUNT APARTMENT A

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:43.220
FINANCE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

00:38:43.287 --> 00:38:44.989
THE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT AWARE

00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:46.090
THAT THIS WITH BILL WITH APPLY

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:47.858
TO THEM AND THEREFORE THIS IS

00:38:47.925 --> 00:38:48.926
PART OF THE REASON. FOR THE NEED

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:51.028
WHEN THIS ISSUE CAME UP IN LATE

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:53.330
MARCH BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE --

00:38:53.397 --> 00:38:54.465
YOU KNOW POSSIBLY TO A FAX

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:55.800
EITHER IT'S GOING TO EFFECTIVELY

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:57.034
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PRO IS A

COUNTRY WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS

00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:00.037
OR THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:02.006
CAN -- BUDGET IMPACT TO TREAT

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:03.507
MORE FOLKS UNDER THE HOUSING

00:39:03.574 --> 00:39:05.176
FIRST PRINCIPLE SO -- THEY

00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:07.378
WEREN'T AWARE AND I THINK IT'S

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:09.246
AN INTERPRETATION OF THE

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:12.049
LANGUAGE AFTER THAT THE THE FACT

00:39:12.116 --> 00:39:13.117
THAT'S DRIVING THE NEED FOR THIS

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:14.151
CHANGE WHY YES AND WE'RE STILL

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:15.052
LEFT WITH THE POLICY

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:17.254
CONVERSATIONS SO HAPPENING GAUGE

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:21.358
HELD OPEN BUT JUST WANT TO SAY

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:26.430
THAT SO THERE'S NO SURPRISES.

00:39:26.497 --> 00:39:29.433
THANK YOU.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.035
A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- NUMBER ONE

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:31.836
IS TIME SENSITIVE.

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:33.304
IT IS VERY TIME SENSITIVE -- THE

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.205
SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY REQUIRES THAT

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:34.839
STATE DEPARTMENTS COMPLY WITH

00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:36.173
THE REQUIREMENTS OF HOUSING

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:36.941
FIRST.

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:40.111
BY JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND

00:39:40.177 --> 00:39:41.312
NINETEEN AND AS THE COUNCIL

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:42.880
WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING

00:39:42.947 --> 00:39:45.182
WITH THE DEPARTMENTS TO ENSURE

00:39:45.249 --> 00:39:47.351
THAT COMPLIANCE.

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:47.985
AND WHAT OTHER GROUPS WILL THIS

00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:51.088
AFFECT.

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:52.823
I CAN SPEAK TO THAT -- AND I

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.658
WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I DO

00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:57.194
REPRESENT CDC ARE -- ON THE

00:39:57.261 --> 00:39:58.796
COMMERCE COURT NAME FINANCING

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:01.899
COUNCIL AND SO I CAN -- SUPPORT

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:04.668
THAT -- WE WERE UNAWARE THAT ARE

00:40:04.735 --> 00:40:06.604
TREATMENT PROGRAMS WOULD FALL

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.405
UNDERNEATH THIS PARTICULAR

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:10.741
COMPONENT AND INTO IT UNTIL LATE

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:15.412
MARCH AND SO -- BUT AT AS A ARE

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:18.349
MY COUNSEL ACTUALLY TRIES TO TO

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:19.817
ADVOCATE FOR POLICIES THAT ARE

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:20.951
IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PEOPLE

00:40:21.018 --> 00:40:22.186
WHO HAVE BOTH SUBSTANCE USE A

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:23.521
MENTAL ILLNESS AS WELL AS FORMER

00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:24.722
INCARCERATION.

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:26.190
SO THERE ARE POTENTIALLY OTHER

00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:27.525
STATE DEPARTMENTSIT'S NOT

00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:29.827
NECESSARILY A CDC ARE ISSUE THAT

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:34.465
DO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:35.432
WHO ARE EXITING INCARCERATION.

00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:36.734
TO RECEIVE TREATMENT SERVICES

00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:37.668
FOR THEIR SUBSTANCE USE NEED SO

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:39.136
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OTHER

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:41.071
DEPARTMENTS POTENTIALLY GRANTS

00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:42.339
THAT ARE OPERATED THROUGH THE

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:42.907
BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:43.841
CORRECTIONS.

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:45.342
AS WELL AS SOME OTHER PROGRAMS

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:47.378
THAT ARE OPERATED -- THROUGH THE

00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:48.479
DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:51.749
MIGHT -- BE IMPACTED BY THIS IN

00:40:51.816 --> 00:40:53.851
THAT THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:56.220
PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE AN OFFER

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:58.088
SOBER LIVING AS A CHOICE AND

00:40:58.155 --> 00:40:59.623
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD NO

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.025
LONGER HAVE SOBER LIVING AS A

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:02.960
CHOICE.

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:03.861
WHAT WAS THE UNIVERSE WERE

00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:05.062
TALKING HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS?

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:12.269
WE HAVE AN IDEA -- WE HAD A NO

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:15.272
SO -- ACTUALLY WE WE COULD HAVE

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:15.906
THE DEPARTMENT A MEMBER OF UP

00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:17.641
HERE BUT I THINK ROUGHLY OVER A

00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:19.043
THREE YEAR PERIOD.

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:20.544
THEIR TREATMENT PROGRAMS THAT

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:24.048
HAVE A HOUSING ELEMENT -- SERVE

00:41:24.114 --> 00:41:26.951
ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND PAROLEES

00:41:27.017 --> 00:41:29.420
SO -- WHAT'S THE QUICK MATH ON

00:41:29.486 --> 00:41:31.555
THAT LIKE SIX OR FIVE OR SIX

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:32.223
THOUSAND PAROLEES PER YEAR COULD

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:33.624
BE IMPACTED I MEAN IT WOULD BE

00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:34.859
SOME SUBSET OF THAT BECAUSE THEY

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:35.993
COULD STILL PROVIDE TREATMENT

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.261
SERVICES.

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:38.395
AND HOUSING IT'S JUST THAT WOULD

00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:39.230
BE HAVE TO BE DONE IN A

00:41:39.296 --> 00:41:40.631
DIFFERENT FASHION THAT HOUSING

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:42.166
WOULD HAVE TO BE EXTENDED.

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:43.100
SO THEN YOU'RE DO YOU HAVE TO

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:44.301
ACTUALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:41:44.368 --> 00:41:45.769
SLOTS PROBABLY TO PROVIDE THE

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:47.304
SAME LEVEL OF PROGRAM SO I JUST

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:49.173
WANNA CONFIRM HE SAID ABOUT.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.277
FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND YES THERE'S

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:54.411
ABSOLUTE HERE.

00:41:54.478 --> 00:41:55.512
A YEAR SO TALK ABOUT FIVE OR SIX

00:41:55.579 --> 00:41:56.146
THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR INSTEAD

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:56.680
OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE.

00:41:56.747 --> 00:41:58.015
THE LEGISLATURE SAID

00:41:58.082 --> 00:41:59.049
RESOUNDINGLY.

00:41:59.116 --> 00:42:00.985
WE WANT TO CRIMINALIZE A LOT OF

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:03.554
THINGS DRUGS AND OR ALCOHOL THE

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:04.889
HARDEST THINGS TO GET OFF OF NO

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:06.123
MATTER IF YOU'VE GOT A CRIMINAL

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:08.459
BACKGROUND I USE JOE BLOW.

00:42:08.525 --> 00:42:10.594
IT IS TOUGH SPECIAL ALCOHOLISM

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:11.328
BUT THE EFFECT OF THE DRUG

00:42:11.395 --> 00:42:12.930
PROBLEM IT IS HARD TO KICK THE

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:14.365
STATE DOES NOT OFFER ENOUGH

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:15.866
PROGRAMS.

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:17.368
IN THE LEGISLATURE'S IS ETHICAL

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:19.203
BILLION IS FOR FOLKS TO GET

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.071
THEMSELVES PLAYING THAT'S A HARD

00:42:21.138 --> 00:42:23.040
THING TO DO.

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:24.241
WE NEED THE RESOURCES.

00:42:24.308 --> 00:42:25.209
WE DON'T WANT FOLKS IN STATE

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:26.710
PRISON LEGISLATURE WE UP HERE

00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:28.979
SAID THAT WE VOTE ON THOSE BILLS.

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:30.247
SO AT SOME POINT IS WATER COMING

00:42:30.314 --> 00:42:32.116
BACK OUT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A

00:42:32.182 --> 00:42:33.684
DEGREE OF SUCCESS.

00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:35.953
THIS IS THE INTEGRAL PART IN

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.187
STARTING THAT SO.

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:39.490
AG SAID IT'S IT'S FIVE OR SIX

00:42:39.556 --> 00:42:40.658
THOUSAND PEOPLE PER YEAR.

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:41.892
OUT OF THE STATE OF FORTY

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:44.328
MILLION SO.

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:45.963
HOPEFULLY THE PEOPLE GET.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.231
IT TOGETHER AND WE SEE THAT YOU

00:42:47.298 --> 00:42:49.633
MAY NEED OR THEY DON'T COME BACK.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.468
SO FOR ME IT'S IT'S KIND OF A A

00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:52.836
SMALL PRICE TO PAY.

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:54.138
WHERE WERE HELPING WITH THAT

00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:56.740
LIKE I SAID IF YOU LOOK BACK THE

00:42:56.807 --> 00:42:59.376
LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED?

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:00.544
THE NO ONE ELSE IN PRISON THE

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:01.278
JAILS AND I WANT TO PASS ANY

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:02.546
LAWS THE LEGISLATURE WAS

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:03.380
SPEAKING.

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:06.083
THAT -- ENHANCED PENALTIES OR

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.684
SINCE ANYBODY BACK [inaudible]

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.185
TO PRISON [inaudible]

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.753
SO.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.688
IT'S IN ALL OF THESE FOLKS ARE

00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:12.389
SOME OF OUR MOST AT RISK.

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:13.023
AND THEY HAVE A HIGH CHANCE OF

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.059
RE OFFENDING SO I WOULD SAY ON

00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:16.994
THE WRIST KILL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:18.228
THEY'RE PROBABLY HIGHER THAN

00:43:18.295 --> 00:43:19.363
SOMEONE THAT'S JUST STRAIGHT

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.664
HOMELESSNESS.

00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:22.199
SO I THINK THAT THE RISK TO THE

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:24.234
PUBLIC.

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:25.869
IS GREATLY.

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:27.571
INCREASE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS

00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:29.473
LIVING IN THE PROPER TREATMENT.

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:30.507
I THINK THIS LEGAL LONG WAY IN

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:31.575
AND GETTING THEM BACK ON THE

00:43:31.642 --> 00:43:32.476
RIGHT PATH SO THIS IS SOMETHING

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:34.011
GET BEHIND.

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:36.380
AND SUPPORT -- AND OVERALL

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:37.948
VOTING ON THIS WILL HOLD OPEN

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:40.117
TODAY -- BUT YOU GOTTA TAKE A

00:43:40.184 --> 00:43:42.820
REALLY DEEP LOOK AT INSIDE IN A

00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:44.355
LIQUID LEGISLATURE'S MAN IS BAD

00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:45.823
I'VE BEEN HERE FIVE YEARS.

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:49.226
AND THAT'S BEEN THE MANDATE.

00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:51.128
SO WE CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:51.729
I THINK THE ONE THING THAT IF

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:52.262
YOU WOULD -- GIVE ME THE

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:53.397
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY WE DO A LOT

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:54.398
OF WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:56.066
FORMALLY INCARCERATED I THINK

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:57.134
ONE OF THE REASONS I WANTED TO

00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:58.135
BE HERE TODAY AND WHY IT WAS SO

00:43:58.202 --> 00:43:59.403
VOCAL ON THE COUNCIL.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:00.671
IS THAT IT'S INDIVIDUALS

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:01.772
THEMSELVES WHO ARE FORMALLY

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:03.574
INCARCERATED WHO CAME TO US AND

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.776
SAID WE WANT THE CHOICE OF SOBER

00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:08.178
LIVING WE WANT THAT CHOICE --

00:44:08.245 --> 00:44:09.813
AND I JUST DON'T WANT AND I

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.715
DON'T THINK IT WAS THE INTENT OF

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:13.083
THE LEGISLATURE TO POTENTIALLY.

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:14.985
INADVERTENTLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:16.487
TAKE THAT OPTION AWAY FROM

00:44:16.553 --> 00:44:19.423
PEOPLE -- AND I KNOW THAT IF IF

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.290
THERE WERE OTHER INDIVIDUALS

00:44:20.357 --> 00:44:23.761
HERE TODAY WHO WERE -- FORMALLY

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:25.129
INCARCERATED THEY MIGHT SHARE

00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:26.463
THEIR STORIES ABOUT HOW FOR A

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.165
VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME DURING

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:29.566
THAT IMMEDIATE TRANSITION HOME

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:30.701
FROM PRISON.

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:34.538
THAT BEING ABLE -- TO BE IN A

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:35.906
SOBER ENVIRONMENT WAS REALLY

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:38.876
CRITICAL TO THEIR REINTEGRATION

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:49.686
AND THEIR RE ENTRY [inaudible]

00:44:49.753 --> 00:44:55.059
THE IF I COULD JUST ASK A

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.794
QUESTION ON THIS POINT SO I GET

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.529
THAT THERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS

00:44:58.595 --> 00:44:59.730
THAT WANT TO LIVE IN SEVERAL

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:01.198
LIVING FACILITIES BUT YOU'RE

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:02.833
DEFINING RECOVERY HOUSING.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.034
AS SOBER LIVING FACILITIES ARE

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:05.335
NOT GIVEN AN OPTION INDIVIDUALS

00:45:05.402 --> 00:45:06.703
WERE STRUGGLING.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:08.772
WITH ADDICTIONS WHO DON'T WANT

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:10.007
TO BE ON THE STREET TO HAVE THAT

00:45:10.074 --> 00:45:11.642
OPTION AND THAT'S WHAT I'M

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:14.011
CONCERNED ABOUT HERE.

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:15.646
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND THE

00:45:15.712 --> 00:45:16.780
SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION WHAT

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:18.048
THE THE THE WAY YOU THE WAY THE

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:19.550
WAY THE LANGUAGES DEFINING

00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:21.652
RECOVERY HOUSING IT ONLY

00:45:21.718 --> 00:45:22.586
INCLUDES.

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:23.854
SEVERAL LIVING FACILITIES AND

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.456
PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE HOUSING IN

00:45:25.522 --> 00:45:26.557
AN ABSTINENCE FOCUSED IN PEER

00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:28.158
SUPPORT  COMMUNITY SO THERE IS

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:29.927
NO OTHER POSSIBILITY OF OTHER

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:31.728
TYPES OF FACILITIES. FOR

00:45:31.795 --> 00:45:33.130
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE STRUGGLING.

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:34.832
AS YOU SAID THERE MIGHT BE SOME

00:45:34.898 --> 00:45:36.667
INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO CHOOSE

00:45:36.733 --> 00:45:37.167
TO BE IN A SOBER LIVING

00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:39.036
FACILITIES BUT OTHERS WHO ARE

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:40.671
DEALING WITH ADDICTIONS HAVE NOT

00:45:40.737 --> 00:45:43.307
BEEN ABLE -- TO TO TO WIN

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:44.741
THEMSELVES OFF THOSE ADDICTIONS

00:45:44.808 --> 00:45:45.476
AND I FEEL.

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:46.977
IF IF THE ALTERNATIVE IS THE

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:48.579
STREETS THAT'S WHAT I'M THAT'S

00:45:48.645 --> 00:45:49.646
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:45:49.713 --> 00:45:51.748
THE DEFINITION OF RECOVERY

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:53.417
HOUSING ACTUALLY IS THE HIGH

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:56.086
DEFINITION -- THAT IT THAT SORT

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:57.955
OF THE TERM OF ART THAT HUD IS

00:45:58.021 --> 00:45:59.289
USING NOW IT INCLUDES SOBER

00:45:59.356 --> 00:46:01.625
LIVING FACILITIES AND OTHER

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:04.394
KINDS OF SUPPORTED SOBER LIVING

00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:07.431
ENVIRONMENTS -- I WANT TO

00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:09.133
EMPHASIZE THAT IT IS NOT OUR

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:12.469
GOAL. TO PRECLUDE ANYONE FROM

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:14.905
SEEKING OTHER KINDS OF TREATMENT --

00:46:14.972 --> 00:46:16.440
THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS

00:46:16.507 --> 00:46:19.643
WE HAVE AS A REQUIREMENT THAT

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.245
PARTICIPATION BE VOLUNTARY.

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:22.946
AND THAT IF SOMEONE DECIDES THEY

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:24.448
NO LONGER WANT TO REMAIN IN A

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:25.983
SOBER LIVING ENVIRONMENT THAT

00:46:26.049 --> 00:46:28.252
THEY'RE ASSISTED IN FINDING

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:29.953
OTHER KINDS OF HOUSING --

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.489
INCLUDING HOUSING THAT IS HARM

00:46:32.556 --> 00:46:34.525
REDUCTION BASED WHICH DOES NOT

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:36.860
REQUIRE SOBRIETY IS A CONDITION

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:43.800
OF RESIDENTS SO I AGREE WITH YOU.

00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:44.835

00:46:44.902 --> 00:46:45.469

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:47.037
DEFINITION BEING A FEDERALLY

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:49.640

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:51.808

IT'S A TREATMENT CHOICE OPTION

00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:15.532
THAT ISN'T POSSIBLE WITH THE

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:17.167
