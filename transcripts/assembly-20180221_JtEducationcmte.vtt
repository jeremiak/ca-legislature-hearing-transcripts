BACK TO A CATEGORICAL APPROACH

00:38:22.167 --> 00:38:25.170 region:rollup2
COULD BE A SIGNAL THAT CT IS

LASTLY WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT THE

WHEN COMPARED TO THE CT

00:38:51.129 --> 00:38:54.632 region:rollup2

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:57.368 region:rollup2
FEW ADVANTAGES OVER THE

RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:16.114 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WITH REGARD TO

00:40:13.044 --> 00:40:16.648 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD TO CT.

00:40:16.114 --> 00:40:18.182 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THERE ARE MANY

00:40:16.648 --> 00:40:20.418 region:rollup2
BENEFITS TO THE LOCAL CONTROL

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:21.953 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA APPROACH.

00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:23.488 region:rollup2
THE FORMULA IS FULLY FUNDED IN

00:40:21.953 --> 00:40:25.290 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET YEAR WE'VE HAD FIVE

00:40:23.488 --> 00:40:27.659 region:rollup2
YEARS OF TRANSITIONAL FUNDING.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:28.226 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE OF ITS

00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:30.295 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS

00:40:28.226 --> 00:40:31.496 region:rollup2
INDICATOR.

00:40:30.295 --> 00:40:32.630 region:rollup2
FOR THIS REASON WE RECOMMEND

00:40:31.496 --> 00:40:35.333 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATURE TAKE THE

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:37.101 region:rollup2
LCF APPROACH WE BELIEVE THAT IF

00:40:35.333 --> 00:40:38.303 region:rollup2
IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS CONCERNS

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:41.105 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF CREATING A

00:40:38.303 --> 00:40:42.640 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL PROGRAM. IT CAN A

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:45.243 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS IN OTHER

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.678 region:rollup2
WAYS FOR EXAMPLE IF THE CONCERN

00:40:45.243 --> 00:40:47.946 region:rollup2
IS THAT NOT ENOUGH FUNDING IS

00:40:46.678 --> 00:40:50.581 region:rollup2
PROVIDED TO HIGH SCHOOLS OFFER

00:40:47.946 --> 00:40:52.183 region:rollup2
CT THE LEGISLATURE CAN REVISIT

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:53.584 region:rollup2
THE HIGH SCHOOL FUNDING AMOUNT.

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:54.852 region:rollup2
IF THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:56.554 region:rollup2
NOT STRONG ENOUGH INCENTIVES

00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:58.423 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:59.557 region:rollup2
THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE WE THINK

00:40:58.423 --> 00:41:00.992 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE COULD REVISIT

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:02.560 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE HAVE SOME

00:41:00.992 --> 00:41:05.763 region:rollup2
IDEAS TO SHERIFF IF THAT ISN'T

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.265 region:rollup2
INTEREST. OF ON THE COMMITTEES.

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:09.233 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES

00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:10.768 region:rollup2
WISH TO TAKE THE CATEGORICAL

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:12.070 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO CUT TO CT <u><c.green>. WE</c></u>

00:41:10.768 --> 00:41:13.671 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND TAKING THE CT

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:14.272 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE GRANT APPROACH WITH

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:16.140 region:rollup2
SOME MODIFICATIONS THAT BRING

00:41:14.272 --> 00:41:17.442 region:rollup2
IN.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:20.144 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE COORDINATION THAT

00:41:17.442 --> 00:41:22.113 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR SUGGESTS.

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:23.981 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY. A WE BELIEVE THAT

00:41:22.113 --> 00:41:25.683 region:rollup2
A LINING A PORTION OF THE CT

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:26.784 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO WORKFORCE NEEDS BUT

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:28.086 region:rollup2
NOT ALL OF IT COULD HELP WITH

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:30.088 region:rollup2
ALIGNMENT BETWEEN COMMUNITY

00:41:28.086 --> 00:41:31.689 region:rollup2
COLLEGES. AND K. TWELVE CT

00:41:30.088 --> 00:41:33.624 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:35.226 region:rollup2
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT REQUIRING

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:36.527 region:rollup2
THE CD  <u><c.green>AND THE COMMUNITY</c></u>

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:38.463 region:rollup2
COLLEGES TO SHARE DATA

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:41.232 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY. COULD STRENGTHEN

00:41:38.463 --> 00:41:42.934 region:rollup2
COORDINATION FOR EXAMPLE BY

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:44.502 region:rollup2
REQUIRING QUE TWELVE AND

00:41:42.934 --> 00:41:45.670 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO LINK DATA

00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:47.205 region:rollup2
SUCH THAT WE COULD SEE ONE A

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:49.040 region:rollup2
STUDENT LEAVES HIGH SCHOOL IF

00:41:47.205 --> 00:41:51.008 region:rollup2
THEY ENTER CT PROGRAM IF THEY'RE

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.745 region:rollup2
REMEDIATED AND HOW WELL THEY

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:54.979 region:rollup2
PERFORM AFTER THAT STAGE.

00:41:53.745 --> 00:41:56.147 region:rollup2
TO FURTHER COORDINATE WE

00:41:54.979 --> 00:41:58.349 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND ROLLING IN THE

00:41:56.147 --> 00:41:59.617 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:01.519 region:rollup2
THAT ARE STILL OUTSIDE OF THE LC

00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:03.588 region:rollup2
FF IN TO ANY NEW CATEGORICAL

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:04.789 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:42:03.588 --> 00:42:07.759 region:rollup2
BURDEN AND PROVIDE MORE

00:42:04.789 --> 00:42:09.060 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED APPROACH.

00:42:07.759 --> 00:42:10.795 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.130 region:rollup2
REVISIT IN FUTURE YEARS TO SEE

00:42:10.795 --> 00:42:13.531 region:rollup2
IF THIS PROGRAM IS MEETING ITS

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:14.899 region:rollup2
GOALS WE RECOMMEND THE

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:16.567 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER MAKING THE

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:19.804 region:rollup2
PROGRAM LIMITED TERM AND SETTING

00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:22.240 region:rollup2
VERY CLEAR DATA. EXPECTATIONS AS

00:42:19.804 --> 00:42:23.574 region:rollup2
WELL AS TARGETS FOR SCHOOLS.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.109 region:rollup2
IN THAT WAY THE LEGISLATURE

00:42:23.574 --> 00:42:27.178 region:rollup2
COULD COME BACK IN SEVERAL YEARS

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:27.812 region:rollup2
AND EVALUATE WHETHER IT'S

00:42:27.178 --> 00:42:30.048 region:rollup2
MEETING THE GOALS THAT WERE PUT

00:42:27.812 --> 00:42:32.016 region:rollup2
FORTH.

00:42:30.048 --> 00:42:32.817 region:rollup2
FOR FUNDING THE PROGRAM WE THINK

00:42:32.016 --> 00:42:34.085 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO

00:42:32.817 --> 00:42:36.821 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THE TRADEOFFS OF HOW

00:42:34.085 --> 00:42:37.889 region:rollup2
MUCH FUNDING TO PROVIDE.

00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:39.690 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT GOES TOWARDS A

00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:41.392 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL PROGRAM IS FUNDING

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:43.061 region:rollup2
THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR

OTHER PRIORITIES OR FOR THE

00:42:43.061 --> 00:42:46.130 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

00:42:44.729 --> 00:42:47.865 region:rollup2
WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.600 region:rollup2
CONSIDER SETTING THE AMOUNT AT A

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:50.601 region:rollup2
RATE THAT SIGNALS.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:53.204 region:rollup2

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:55.339 region:rollup2

UNDERSTATEMENT FRACTIONS LED TO

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:46.937 region:rollup2
OUR CONSTRUCTION AND USE A

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:48.071 region:rollup2
MEASURING TAPE RIGHT HAD A

01:01:46.937 --> 01:01:50.307 region:rollup2
REALLY LEARN WHAT. THE

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:50.807 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE THREE IN FIVE MASON

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:51.341 region:rollup2
SEVENTY SECOND PLAN THE

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:53.276 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:53.877 region:rollup2
BUT TO PLAN THE REAL WORLD IS

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:56.346 region:rollup2
MUCH DIFFERENT THAT'S WHAT I

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:58.215 region:rollup2
THINK CT. OF PROGRAMS DAVID YOU

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:59.015 region:rollup2
SHE YOU KNOW ME OFF YOUR CONCERN

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.717 region:rollup2
MIND YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN RESPOND

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:02.252 region:rollup2
TO. MY CONCERN IS THAT WE MIGHT

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.386 region:rollup2
START TRACKING STUDENTS IN

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:04.220 region:rollup2
SEVENTH GRADE.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.822 region:rollup2
RIGHT THIS SOME OF THE GERMAN

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:07.324 region:rollup2
MODEL RIGHT WE STARTED SEVENTH

01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:09.092 region:rollup2
GRADE YOU PICK YOUR LANE.

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:10.727 region:rollup2
ARE YOU CAN YOU SEE T..

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:12.195 region:rollup2
ARE YOU GONNA GO TO UNIVERSITY

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:13.697 region:rollup2
AND I I I WANT STUDENTS TO

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:14.864 region:rollup2
PREPARE FOR BOTH FOR SURE.

01:02:13.697 --> 01:02:17.033 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO WANT THEM TO HAVE

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:18.301 region:rollup2
OPTIONS FOR BOTH AND NOT TO LOCK

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:20.003 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES AND FOR THE REST OF

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:21.504 region:rollup2
LIFE IN SEVENTH GRADE HIS IRA MY

01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:23.673 region:rollup2
WORLD IS A SEVENTH GRADER.

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:25.742 region:rollup2
WASN'T TOO BROAD RIGHT I'M COULD

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:27.711 region:rollup2
YOU COMMENT ON THAT.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:29.245 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE STATE AND THE

01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:30.981 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAVE HAD CONCERNS

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:32.349 region:rollup2
WITH TRACKING STUDENTS AND

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:34.050 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:34.718 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAS MOVED TOWARDS MORE

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:36.186 region:rollup2
OF.

01:02:34.718 --> 01:02:37.320 region:rollup2
THE MODEL I I THINK WE ARE WE

01:02:36.186 --> 01:02:38.855 region:rollup2
CALL IT MANY TIMES CAREER

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.456 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS ARE LINKED LEARNING

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:41.391 region:rollup2
MODEL WHERE STUDENTS ARE ABLE

01:02:39.456 --> 01:02:42.926 region:rollup2
TO.

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:44.160 region:rollup2
WHAT THE GOAL IS REALLY BEEN

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:46.029 region:rollup2
FOR STUDENTS TO BE COLLEGE AND

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.831 region:rollup2
CAREER READY WHERE THEY WOULD

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:49.332 region:rollup2
HAVE AN OPTION TO ATTEND A FOUR

01:02:47.831 --> 01:02:50.767 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY OR?

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:52.269 region:rollup2
JOIN THE WORKFORCE OR ENROLL IN

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.802 region:rollup2
A TRAINING PROGRAM AFTER HIGH

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:54.738 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:56.973 region:rollup2
FOR THAT VERY REASON WE WANT TO

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:57.340 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:58.375 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AREN'T.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.976 region:rollup2
.

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:02.679 region:rollup2
NUDGED AND INTO CERTAIN.

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:04.447 region:rollup2
CERTAIN PATHWAYS TRACKING

01:03:02.679 --> 01:03:05.015 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY AS HAS BEEN AT

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.316 region:rollup2
BENNETT CONCERN AND I THINK

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:08.018 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:10.186 region:rollup2
THE THE STEPS THROUGH THE LC FF

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:11.788 region:rollup2
AND THE COLLEGE IN CORRECTING A

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:13.757 region:rollup2
SYNDICATE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:14.791 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT GREAT THANK YOU

01:03:13.757 --> 01:03:15.659 region:rollup2
NEXT QUESTIONS FOR THE

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.459 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I VERY

01:03:15.659 --> 01:03:18.161 region:rollup2
MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:19.896 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR SEEN THE NEED. FOR MORE

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:20.497 region:rollup2
CT FUNDING WITH TWO HUNDRED

01:03:19.896 --> 01:03:21.564 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ONGOING

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:22.265 region:rollup2
BASIS.

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.566 region:rollup2
NOT JUST SAYING A FOR THREE

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:24.401 region:rollup2
YEARS WERE GONNA DO THIS AND

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:24.934 region:rollup2
THEN WE'RE GOING TO GIVE UP ON

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:25.869 region:rollup2
IT SO I THINK THAT'S VERY

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:27.671 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:29.039 region:rollup2
THOUGH ONE MAJOR CHALLENGE I

01:03:27.671 --> 01:03:30.740 region:rollup2
HAVE WITH THIS PROPOSAL YOU

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:32.242 region:rollup2
PROBABLY KNOWS THE CONSORTIUM.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.109 region:rollup2
THAT TO ME IS LIKE THE SOVIET

01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:35.211 region:rollup2
BLOCK I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:36.813 region:rollup2
ARE GONNA GET THEIR MONEY. ON

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:39.349 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE GONNA GET IT FAIRLY.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:41.318 region:rollup2
IT'S HANDED OVER TO THE

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:42.285 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:44.187 region:rollup2
WHICH IS VERY POOR PRECEDENT MY

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:45.889 region:rollup2
MIND THAT WE WOULD GIVE THEM THE

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:46.690 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY.

01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:48.091 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS.

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:48.958 region:rollup2
Y. WOULDN'T WOULDN'T KEEP THIS

01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:50.660 region:rollup2
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:51.561 region:rollup2
I'M STILL CURIOUS.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.129 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE CHALLENGES THE

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:53.697 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT EDUCATIONAL LET'S

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.864 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THOSE LET'S ADDRESS

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:56.1000 region:rollup2
THOSE.

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:58.334 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN WE HANDED OVER THE

01:03:56.1000 --> 01:03:59.369 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEN THEY

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:01.171 region:rollup2
HAND IT DOWN THE LOCAL

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:03.139 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM. MY CONCERN IS ALSO

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:03.873 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL CONSORTIUM LEVEL IT'S

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:05.909 region:rollup2
HANDED DOWN OF THE CONSORTIA

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:06.943 region:rollup2
THINK ON AN EIGHTY A BASIS BUT

01:04:05.909 --> 01:04:08.478 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT HANDED OUT BY THE

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:10.246 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM ON AN EIGHTY BASIS IF

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:12.015 region:rollup2
I'M CORRECT. SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:13.350 region:rollup2
HOW THAT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK AND

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:15.452 region:rollup2
HOW IT'S GOING TO BE FAIR THAT.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:16.853 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WON'T GET OUT VOTED AT

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:19.122 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL LEVEL ETCETERA.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:20.290 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:04:19.122 --> 01:04:21.791 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A LOT IN YOUR IN YOUR

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:24.127 region:rollup2
QUESTION FALL TRYING IF IF I

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:25.195 region:rollup2
MISSED ANYTHING GO FREE BECAUSE

01:04:24.127 --> 01:04:27.063 region:rollup2
SHE WAS A GUY I GUESS YOU.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:27.697 region:rollup2
SO THE APPROACH TO PROVIDE

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:29.532 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO ADD THAT THECOMMUNITY

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:31.000 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:32.302 region:rollup2
OFFICE THERE REALLY ALLOCATING

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.270 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING DOWN TO THE

01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:35.972 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM BASED ON A CALCULATED

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.940 region:rollup2
FORMULA. SO IT WOULDN'T

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:37.974 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY MATTER IF THE

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.175 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WITH

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:40.376 region:rollup2
CALCULATING THAT FORMULA OR

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:42.178 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:44.414 region:rollup2
WITH CALCULATING THAT FORMULA.

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:45.749 region:rollup2
THE FORMULA WILL BE WHAT IT IS

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:47.183 region:rollup2
AND BASED ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT

01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:48.618 region:rollup2
RATE RATE IN THE REGION THE

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:50.353 region:rollup2
PROJECTED JOB OPENINGS AND SEVEN

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:52.021 region:rollup2
FOR TWELVE EIGHTY A. UP AT THE

01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:53.590 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM LEVEL IS REALLY WHERE

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:55.458 region:rollup2
THE DECISIONS ON HOW WITHOUT

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:56.793 region:rollup2
FUNDING IT'S GETTING DISPERSED

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:59.662 region:rollup2
TO THE ALLEY AIDS THAT THAT'S

01:04:56.793 --> 01:05:00.296 region:rollup2
REALLY WHERE IT'S GOING TO

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:00.530 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IS DOWN AT THE CONSORTIUM

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:01.097 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:02.265 region:rollup2
AND CURRENTLY I AM IN IT

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:03.333 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM ARE ARE WORKING VERY

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:04.968 region:rollup2
CLOSELY WITH OUR INDUSTRY

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:06.669 region:rollup2
PARTNERS IN THEIR REGION TO MAKE

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:07.737 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:09.839 region:rollup2
OFFERINGS IN THEIR AREA ARE

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:11.207 region:rollup2
LYING TO INDUSTRY NEEDS. AND WE

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:12.742 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE THAT THAT AT

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:13.943 region:rollup2
COOPERATION WILL CONTINUE AS THE

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.578 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM GETS

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:17.080 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED. REALLY WITH THE

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.882 region:rollup2
INTENTION OF MAKING SURE THAT

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.784 region:rollup2
THE K. TWELVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:05:18.882 --> 01:05:22.619 region:rollup2
BEING FUNDED THROUGH THAT'S HAVE

01:05:20.784 --> 01:05:24.621 region:rollup2
FOR THROUGH THAT'S PROPOSAL. ARE

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:26.923 region:rollup2
FINE OUR MEETING INDUSTRY NEEDS

01:05:24.621 --> 01:05:28.525 region:rollup2
AND THAT AREA AND ARE DRIVEN BY

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.691 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE DEMAND IN THAT AREA.

01:05:28.525 --> 01:05:31.361 region:rollup2
SO.

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:32.962 region:rollup2
IT AT THAT SUBCOMMITTEE IS IS

01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:34.731 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WE'VE

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:35.999 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED TO REALLY TRY AND

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:37.700 region:rollup2
HELP MITIGATE SOME OF THE

01:05:35.999 --> 01:05:39.202 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.937 region:rollup2
WOULD BE MAKING THESE DECISIONS.

01:05:39.202 --> 01:05:42.972 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF OF THE K. TWELVE IN

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:45.108 region:rollup2
THEIR AREA. THIS SUB COMMITTEE

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:46.976 region:rollup2
IS MADE UP OF A HAM IT UP OF

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:48.611 region:rollup2
EXPERTS WITH THE K. TWELVE

01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:49.746 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE AND WORKFORCE

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.815 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR IN THEIR

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:54.517 region:rollup2
AREAS SO. WE ARE WORKING WITH

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:55.919 region:rollup2
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE NOW I'M

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:56.486 region:rollup2
IN IN GETTING SOME CALL SET UP

01:05:55.919 --> 01:05:58.922 region:rollup2
WITH SOME OF THE REGIONAL

01:05:56.486 --> 01:06:00.023 region:rollup2
CONSORTIA TO FIGURE OUT. HOW

01:05:58.922 --> 01:06:01.491 region:rollup2
BEST TO INTEGRATE QUE TWELVE

01:06:00.023 --> 01:06:01.958 region:rollup2
INTO THAT PROCESS WITHOUT

01:06:01.491 --> 01:06:03.760 region:rollup2
DISRUPTING THE CURRENT

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:06.396 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE?

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.531 region:rollup2
BUT REALLY OUR GOAL IS THAT

01:06:06.396 --> 01:06:11.901 region:rollup2
THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE MADE DOWN

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:13.770 region:rollup2
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL LEVEL WHERE

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:16.873 region:rollup2
I'M REGIONAL WORKFORCE DEMANDS

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:19.509 region:rollup2
ARE MOST KNOWN TO INDUSTRY IN

01:06:16.873 --> 01:06:22.645 region:rollup2
THAT AREA. AND REALLY GETTING

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:25.548 region:rollup2
THEM TO INFORM THE K. TWELVE OCT

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:29.152 region:rollup2
OFFERINGS GREAT SO FROM A

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:29.819 region:rollup2
DISTRICT AND I'VE GOT NINE OTHER

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:30.820 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS MY CONSORTIA.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.788 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THEM VERY LARGE IT

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.422 region:rollup2
MIGHT IT BE THAT I WOULD GET OUT

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:32.956 region:rollup2
VOTED I WOULDN'T GET ANY THAT

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:34.023 region:rollup2
MONEY THAT WE DO HAVE THE

01:06:32.956 --> 01:06:34.457 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE AND IN THE TRAILER BILL

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:36.092 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:37.193 region:rollup2
IT ESTABLISHES.

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:37.894 region:rollup2
THEY BASICALLY POP FIGHTERS SO

01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:39.162 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME SATISFIED WITH EACH

01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:40.063 region:rollup2
WITHIN EACH CONSORTIA ALLOCATION

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:40.930 region:rollup2
FOR SMALL TO MEDIUM AND LARGER.

01:06:40.063 --> 01:06:41.531 region:rollup2
AND SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THAT

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.732 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT THE SMOKE WOULD

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:43.399 region:rollup2
MAYBE BE SQUEEZED OUT BY SOME OF

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:44.434 region:rollup2
THE LARGE LAW SCHOOL DISTRICT A

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:45.535 region:rollup2
SMALL SCHOOL A IT'S BASED ON

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:47.537 region:rollup2
EIGHTY EIGHT SO IF YOUR PLANE

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:49.439 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE A AS A JPA. IT'S YOU

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:50.173 region:rollup2
KNOW YOU'RE COMBINED ABA IF

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:52.942 region:rollup2
YOU'RE PLAYING AS A SINGLE

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:54.110 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICT FURNITURE YOUR

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:55.378 region:rollup2
DISTRICT'S ADA.

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:55.945 region:rollup2
IT'S HOT IT'S BY EIGHTY OF THE

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:57.280 region:rollup2
DISTRICT NOT YET SCHOOL SITE

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:58.081 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.716 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE PLAYING OUT THE

01:06:58.081 --> 01:07:02.185 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICT OR COUNTY OFFICE

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:04.954 region:rollup2
OR WORK CHARTER SCHOOL ORDERED.

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:05.455 region:rollup2
JPA OKAY I STILL HAVE REAL I

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:07.156 region:rollup2
HAVE SIGNIFICANT I DON'T

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:08.558 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHY WE DESIGNED A

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:09.692 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:11.194 region:rollup2
GO TO THE PARTNER DUCATION

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.828 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT'S IT STRIKES ME AS

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:14.163 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING WHAT. WE

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:15.365 region:rollup2
WANT TO GIVE IT TO THE VICTIM

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:16.032 region:rollup2
NICOLE GE'S.

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:16.633 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALIGNED WITH THE

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.267 region:rollup2
WITH THE LOCAL OF I'M JUST A

01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:19.168 region:rollup2
LITTLE CONFUSED ON WHY YOU JUST

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:20.637 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T KEEP IT.

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:21.738 region:rollup2
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:23.907 region:rollup2
CAN ELABORATE ON THE CHURCH SO.

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:24.974 region:rollup2
.

01:07:23.907 --> 01:07:26.209 region:rollup2
I THINK WE GET TO GET AWAY FROM

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:27.343 region:rollup2
THE MINDSET BUT IT'S ACTUALLY

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.811 region:rollup2
THE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:30.280 region:rollup2
MAKING DECISIONS BECAUSE REALLY

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.813 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PASSING THE FUNDING DOWN

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.115 region:rollup2
TO THE REGIONAL CONSORTIUM

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:34.250 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

01:07:32.115 --> 01:07:35.485 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED IN

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.953 region:rollup2
THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS ONCE

01:07:35.485 --> 01:07:37.787 region:rollup2
IT GETS DOWN TO THAT CONSORTIUM

01:07:36.953 --> 01:07:39.656 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:40.390 region:rollup2
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:41.491 region:rollup2
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.892 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:44.694 region:rollup2
CAPABLE OF MAKING THAT

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:46.095 region:rollup2
CALCULATION. IT'S REALLY BASED

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:47.430 region:rollup2
ON THE FACT THAT THIS IS AN

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:49.399 region:rollup2
EXISTING STRUCTURE THAT THE

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:50.333 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.668 region:rollup2
OFFICE HAS IN PLACE.

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:54.437 region:rollup2
TWO OF THE THREE FACTORS THE

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:55.805 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND BE I AM.

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:57.774 region:rollup2
THE PROTECTIVE JOB OPENINGS IN

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:58.875 region:rollup2
THE REGION OUR CALCULATIONS THAT

01:07:57.774 --> 01:08:01.044 region:rollup2
ARE ALREADY IN THE COMMUNITY

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:02.845 region:rollup2
COLLEGE FORMULA SO THAT THE

01:08:01.044 --> 01:08:04.314 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT EDUCATIONAL JUST BE

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:05.982 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THE EIGHTY A. AND

01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:06.916 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY OUR GOAL WAS TO GET

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:07.850 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING DOWN TO THE

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:09.686 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM AND THE MOST

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:11.120 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT MANNER. AND WE FELT

01:08:09.686 --> 01:08:12.589 region:rollup2
LIKE PROVIDING IT DIRECTLY TO

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.290 region:rollup2
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WHO ARE

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:15.358 region:rollup2
A HOUSE THAT STRUCTURE IN PLACE

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:17.393 region:rollup2
AS MOST EFFICIENT.

01:08:15.358 --> 01:08:18.194 region:rollup2
OKAY AND I JUST AGAIN I THINK WE

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:19.929 region:rollup2
NEED TO THINK BROADER THAN JUST

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:20.964 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE NEED

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:22.665 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:24.033 region:rollup2
HERE TOO. AND IT MIGHT BE.

01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:25.134 region:rollup2
THAT A STUDENT IS AN A MIDDLE

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:27.036 region:rollup2
SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY HAVE

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:27.870 region:rollup2
A PATHWAY PROGRAM THAT MIGHT NOT

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:29.138 region:rollup2
BE AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:30.673 region:rollup2
COLLEGE MIGHT BE SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:32.508 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO GO. AND IT STILL

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:34.243 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE A FIT FOR THAT LOCAL

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:35.178 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BUT THEY MIGHT NOT GO TO

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:36.713 region:rollup2
THEIR VERY LOCAL COMMUNITY

01:08:35.178 --> 01:08:37.780 region:rollup2
COLLEGES I HOPE YOU THINK ABOUT

01:08:36.713 --> 01:08:39.215 region:rollup2
THAT TOO BUT I DON'T GET TOO FAR

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:41.684 region:rollup2
INTO THAT. TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:43.152 region:rollup2
OTHERS HAVE QUESTIONS HERE BUT

01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:44.320 region:rollup2
I'M REAL CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:45.755 region:rollup2
HOW THIS MONEY GETS DOWN ON THE

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.856 region:rollup2
GROUND IN THE ACCOUNTABILITY THE

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:48.324 region:rollup2
GROUND I'D VERY SOMETHING LIKE A

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:48.925 region:rollup2
NAVIGATOR MODEL IN THE

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:49.892 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S TWELVE MILLION AND

01:08:48.925 --> 01:08:50.426 region:rollup2
THERE?

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:52.061 region:rollup2
THAT THEN.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:53.162 region:rollup2
MY HOPE WILL BE THE NAVIGATORS

01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:55.098 region:rollup2
OF THE AROUND THE STATE NOT

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:56.332 region:rollup2
LOCATED IN SACRAMENTO SO THAT

01:08:55.098 --> 01:08:57.934 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD ACT YOU KNOW WE CUT

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:59.535 region:rollup2
INTO REGIONS AND THEY WOULD ACT

01:08:57.934 --> 01:09:01.104 region:rollup2
AS THE LOCAL EXPERTS. ON HOW

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:03.640 region:rollup2
BEST TO CONNECT DISTRICTS

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:04.907 region:rollup2
TO TO TELL TO LOCAL JOB NEEDS

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.543 region:rollup2
REGIONAL JOB NEEDS.

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:08.311 region:rollup2
AGAIN NOT RELYING ON ON ON TO

01:09:07.543 --> 01:09:09.879 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SITTING IN AN OFFICE IN

01:09:08.311 --> 01:09:10.980 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO BUT TAKE THAT TWELVE

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:12.115 region:rollup2
MILLION SPREAD ACROSS THE STATE

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:13.816 region:rollup2
REGION'S.

01:09:12.115 --> 01:09:15.418 region:rollup2
AND AND THEY WOULD DO THE SAME

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:16.519 region:rollup2
THING THAT THIS WHOLE CONSORTIA

01:09:15.418 --> 01:09:18.421 region:rollup2
THING WITH TO SOME A LITTLE

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:19.622 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. SEEMS A

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:21.190 region:rollup2
LONG WAY LEAD TO MAKE.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:23.259 region:rollup2
.

01:09:21.190 --> 01:09:24.794 region:rollup2
OKAY AND I KNOW MR MCCARTY HAD A

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:26.129 region:rollup2
COUPLE QUESTIONS.

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:28.164 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL IT'S

01:09:26.129 --> 01:09:29.365 region:rollup2
GREAT TO SEE THE AT THE BROAD

01:09:28.164 --> 01:09:30.867 region:rollup2
INTEREST FOR COMMITTEES. ROUGHLY

01:09:29.365 --> 01:09:32.468 region:rollup2
MAYBE

01:09:30.867 --> 01:09:33.503 region:rollup2
TWENTY. FIVE PERCENT OF THE

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:35.004 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY I THINK IS

01:09:33.503 --> 01:09:36.239 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN THIS SHOWS HOW

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:38.141 region:rollup2
BIG OF AN INTEREST THAT WE HAVE

01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:39.342 region:rollup2
IN THIS.

01:09:38.141 --> 01:09:40.309 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA GET IN

01:09:39.342 --> 01:09:42.111 region:rollup2
GREAT DETAIL ON THE BUDGET

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:43.112 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE SO I WANT.

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:44.447 region:rollup2
I WANT TO BORE YOU BUT HERE ARE

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:46.883 region:rollup2
THE DETAILS BUT JUST KIND THE

01:09:44.447 --> 01:09:48.384 region:rollup2
BIG PICTURE. BUT CERTAINLY WE'RE

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:49.519 region:rollup2
BOUND THE BUBBLE LAST FEW YEARS

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:51.421 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS FUNDING FOR THIS

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:52.822 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:53.623 region:rollup2
THE ONE TIME MONEY FOUR HUNDRED

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:55.958 region:rollup2
THE THREE INCH THAN TWO HUNDRED

01:09:53.623 --> 01:09:57.860 region:rollup2
SO. IT'S A RELIEF THAT WE HAVE

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:59.429 region:rollup2
AN ONGOING AMOUNT NOW GRANTED

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.664 region:rollup2
THAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:03.166 region:rollup2
COULD BE DEBATED. I DO HAVE A

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:05.268 region:rollup2
GREAT CONCERNS WITH THE LA O.

01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:06.669 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL AS FAR AS HAVING THE

01:10:05.268 --> 01:10:08.037 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WITH THEIR INCREASED

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:10.339 region:rollup2
ELSE IF THAT MONEY PICK AND

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:11.074 region:rollup2
CHOOSE THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:12.341 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER PRIORITIES.

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:14.677 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE THEIR PENSION COSTS

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:16.279 region:rollup2
ARE STIRS COST.

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:17.613 region:rollup2
TEACHER SALARIES YOU KNOW

01:10:16.279 --> 01:10:19.182 region:rollup2
BASICALLY GET GETTING OR FROM

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:20.450 region:rollup2
THE GREAT RECESSION SELF.

01:10:19.182 --> 01:10:21.918 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THIS WILL

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:23.352 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY BE A PRIORITY WHAT

01:10:21.918 --> 01:10:24.654 region:rollup2
YOU WANTED TO BE LESS WE SAY

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:25.988 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO BE A PRIORITY

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:27.090 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHY I THINK.

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:29.225 region:rollup2
IT'S IPORTANT EVERITT WE'RE

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:30.226 region:rollup2
DOING HERE TODAY SO I THINK THAT

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.527 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS AS

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.895 region:rollup2
FAR IT'S REALLY IT'S HOW MUCH

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:34.797 region:rollup2
MONEY ARE GOING TO PUT IN THE

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:36.666 region:rollup2
POT AND THEN HOW WILL IT BE.

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:38.968 region:rollup2
DOLED OUT ACROSS

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:39.602 region:rollup2
LEON ACROSS THE TO CALIFORNIA SO

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:41.237 region:rollup2
THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IT'S A GOOD

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:43.806 region:rollup2
START AT TWO HUNDRED TWELVE ON

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:45.274 region:rollup2
GOING. I THINK HIS DESIRE TO GO

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:46.476 region:rollup2
NORTH OF THERE AND CERTAINLY

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:48.544 region:rollup2
WILL POP WILL PROBABLY PUSH THAT

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:49.479 region:rollup2
IN IN OUR. BUDGET PROCESS IN THE

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:52.048 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY.

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:54.117 region:rollup2
AYE I AM I'M IN LINE WITH THAT

01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:55.618 region:rollup2
MISTER O'DONNELL AS FAR AS THE.

01:10:54.117 --> 01:10:57.820 region:rollup2
MEANT IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:59.956 region:rollup2
I'M NOT QUITE CERTAIN AS FAR AS

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:01.757 region:rollup2
WHY WE'RE PICKING THIS MODEL

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:04.427 region:rollup2
VERSUS THE PAST THREE YEARS. BUT

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:05.061 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I WANT TO

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:05.661 region:rollup2
RAISE WHICH HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT

01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:06.229 region:rollup2
UP YET.

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:08.030 region:rollup2
IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A

01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:10.066 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TYPE HIGH SCHOOLS IN

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:11.767 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA RIGHT. AND SOME KIDS

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:12.869 region:rollup2
AND PARENTS THERE THEY CAN VOTE

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:14.670 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR FEET THEY CAN GO

01:11:12.869 --> 01:11:16.339 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE DISTRICT ACROSS THE

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:18.474 region:rollup2
TOWN. BUT SOMETIMES MAYBE THAT'S

01:11:16.339 --> 01:11:19.809 region:rollup2
YOUR SCHOOL YOU YOU HAVE NO

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:22.612 region:rollup2
OTHER CHOICE MAYBE YOUR HONOR.

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:23.946 region:rollup2
THAT A RURAL AREA MAYBE URBAN

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.780 region:rollup2
AREA AND YOU'RE GONNA GO THAT

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:26.382 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOUR

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:28.117 region:rollup2
PARENTS OR WHOEVER WANT WANT YOU

01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:30.153 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS AND. YOU CAN BE ON A

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:31.654 region:rollup2
LOT BECAUSE THE CONSORTIA AT MAY

01:11:30.153 --> 01:11:33.656 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE YOUR HIGH SCHOOL

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:35.525 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING SO. IN THE OLD

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:37.126 region:rollup2
MODEL WHERE IS A CATEGORICAL YOU

01:11:35.525 --> 01:11:39.562 region:rollup2
KNOW EVERY STUDENT HAD AN

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:40.863 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY AND TO PARTICIPATE.

01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:42.765 region:rollup2
IN OUR AYE RIGHT DIDN'T BUY

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:43.366 region:rollup2
METAL SUBCLASS ROWS OF HIGH

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:46.002 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

01:11:43.366 --> 01:11:47.870 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S DIFFERENT NOW WE

01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:49.205 region:rollup2
WANT TO PICK THE THE THE PROGRAM

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:51.174 region:rollup2
WHICH THINK MAKES THE MOST SENSE

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:52.441 region:rollup2
BUT HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT BASED

01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:54.310 region:rollup2
UPON WHAT. MISTER O'DONNELL SAID

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:55.912 region:rollup2
THEY DID NOT JUST THE ECONOMIC

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:57.580 region:rollup2
NEEDS FOR THE INDUSTRY BUT THAT.

01:11:55.912 --> 01:12:00.216 region:rollup2
HUMAN NEEDS FOR IT A KID WHO

01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:04.153 region:rollup2
WANTS TO. BE ABLE TO TO TO MAKE

01:12:00.216 --> 01:12:04.987 region:rollup2
A GO OF THIS HOW DO WE ENSURE

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.588 region:rollup2
THAT VARIABLE TO.

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.023 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THEY WON'T GET

01:12:05.588 --> 01:12:07.857 region:rollup2
LEFT BEHIND.

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:09.125 region:rollup2
I'VE SURVEYED EXISTING STRONG

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:11.160 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE REGIONAL CONSORTIA

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:14.197 region:rollup2
BOTH COVER THE ENTIRE STATE SO

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.197 region:rollup2
EVERY LA A WILL FALL WITHIN ONE

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:17.633 region:rollup2
CONSORTIA SNOW LA A WILL BE LEFT

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:19.569 region:rollup2
OUT. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THAT

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:20.670 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATE USES TO ENGAGE IN THAT

01:12:19.569 --> 01:12:22.371 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM THAT IS THAT IF

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:23.973 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY UP TO THEM.

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:26.008 region:rollup2
YOU'D NEED AT THIS PROVIDES AN

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:27.476 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE FOR HOPE WE'RE HOPING

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.678 region:rollup2
TO GET THEM FURTHER INVOLVED WE

01:12:27.476 --> 01:12:29.979 region:rollup2
KNOW CURRENTLY ELOISE ARE

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:31.347 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN THESE CONSORTIUM FOR

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:32.915 region:rollup2
NOT JUST COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:34.851 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM. RIGHT NOW.

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:36.285 region:rollup2
SOME ELEAZAR ARE ARE

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:37.553 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN SOME ARE I'M

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:39.155 region:rollup2
EVEN RECEIVING FUNDING THROUGH

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:40.623 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING STRONG WORK FIRST

01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:43.459 region:rollup2
PROGRAM UP THROUGH THE POT

01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:44.193 region:rollup2
THAT'S RESERVE FOR REGIONALLY

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:45.561 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE PROJECTS.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:47.096 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:48.531 region:rollup2
APPROACH WILL LATIN BEAT.

01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:50.166 region:rollup2
FURTHER COOPERATION AT THE LOCAL

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:51.868 region:rollup2
LEVEL SO IF THERE IS A PROGRAM

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:53.436 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY OFFERED

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:54.637 region:rollup2
AT YOUR PARTICULAR SCHOOL. WE

01:12:53.436 --> 01:12:56.639 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THESE WILL LEAD TO

01:12:54.637 --> 01:12:58.774 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS FOR DISTRICTS AND.

01:12:56.639 --> 01:13:00.910 region:rollup2
OTHER ELEAZER IN THE REGION ARE

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:02.745 region:rollup2
TALKING AND AREN'T COLLABORATING

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:03.512 region:rollup2
ON MAKING SURE THAT COURSES ARE

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:05.314 region:rollup2
OFFERED TO STUDENTS IN THEIR

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:06.682 region:rollup2
AREA WE THINK IT WILL LEAD TO

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:08.484 region:rollup2
FURTHER COOPERATION BETWEEN

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:10.586 region:rollup2
ELOISE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:12.788 region:rollup2
FOR THINGS THAT. YOU POSSIBLY

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:13.956 region:rollup2
FOR AND USE THE FACILITIES TO

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:15.491 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT THAT IT DISTRICT

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:16.025 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE FACILITIES

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:17.159 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO OFFER CERTAIN

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:18.628 region:rollup2
CLASS.

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:20.796 region:rollup2
SO WE DO THINK. THAT THIS

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:24.700 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL ACTUALLY EXPAND ACCESS

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:26.168 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN RESTRICTING.

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:27.069 region:rollup2
SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THAT

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:28.671 region:rollup2
WOULD WORK IF YOU'RE INDIVIDUAL

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:30.139 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:31.674 region:rollup2
IN THE INTERIM DO YOU DO YOU

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:33.309 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TRANSFER TO A DIFFERENT

01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:35.745 region:rollup2
SCHOOL HARD YOU HAVE TO WAIT

01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:38.214 region:rollup2
UNTIL. YOUR AREA GETS TOGETHER

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:39.916 region:rollup2
AND COMES TO YOU AS. IT WILL BE

01:13:38.214 --> 01:13:41.417 region:rollup2
FOR YEARS AND YOU'RE LEFT OUT.

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:42.518 region:rollup2
AT GENERATIONS LOST.

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.753 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:45.321 region:rollup2
STUDENT NOW AND AND THERE'S A

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.922 region:rollup2
COURSE THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:49.525 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT BEING OFFERED.

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:50.526 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE THE THOUGH

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:52.428 region:rollup2
SO I'LL CAP PROCESS WHERE YOU

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:53.863 region:rollup2
CAN KIND OF BRING THOSE CONCERNS

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:55.231 region:rollup2
THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND IF YOU

01:13:53.863 --> 01:13:56.098 region:rollup2
GET ENOUGH SUPPORT LOCALLY MAYBE

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:57.700 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE CLASS THAT WILL

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:58.601 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY BE OFFERED ON YOUR

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.469 region:rollup2
CAMPUS.

01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:02.405 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:04.140 region:rollup2
THAT STUDENT IS AWARE OF OTHER

01:14:02.405 --> 01:14:04.707 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES IN THEIR AREA

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:05.975 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE DUTIES OF

01:14:04.707 --> 01:14:07.643 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:09.312 region:rollup2
QUE TWELVE FOR FOURTH PATHWAY

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:10.579 region:rollup2
COORDINATORS THAT WE'RE CREATING

01:14:09.312 --> 01:14:11.914 region:rollup2
IN THE REGION THAT WE THE REASON

01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:13.282 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE CREATED SEVENTY TWO

01:14:11.914 --> 01:14:15.017 region:rollup2
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:16.252 region:rollup2

OVER THE TIME WHEN YOU MAY BE

01:16:26.549 --> 01:16:29.752 region:rollup2
TOO YOUNG BUT I REMEMBER THE

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:32.188 region:rollup2
TIME WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL.

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:34.790 region:rollup2
I HAD OFFERED IN JUNIOR HIGH

SCHOOL.

01:16:37.393 --> 01:16:40.529 region:rollup2

THEY WENT TO JOBS RIGHT NOW

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:49.572 region:rollup2
THAT'S PROVIDING A WAY OF LIFE

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:51.073 region:rollup2
FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES.

01:16:49.572 --> 01:16:52.074 region:rollup2

THEY WERE HOPING TO ACHIEVE AND

01:17:33.449 --> 01:17:36.652 region:rollup2

01:22:53.035 --> 01:22:56.839 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE PROGRAM.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:57.439 region:rollup2
PROJECTED JOBS AND JOB GROWTH I

01:22:56.839 --> 01:22:59.708 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE.

01:22:57.439 --> 01:23:01.443 region:rollup2
IT NO MATTER WHICH DISTRICT YOU

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:03.745 region:rollup2
REPRESENT AND AGAIN I REPRESENT

01:23:01.443 --> 01:23:06.114 region:rollup2
ORANGE COUNTY SO MUCH DIFFERENT

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:07.182 region:rollup2
THAN THE INLAND. EMPIRE THAT WE

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:09.885 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT HAVE WINNERS AND

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:12.554 region:rollup2
LOSERS IN THIS WHICH MEANS THAT

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:14.089 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF WE DO. AS MR GIPSON

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:15.324 region:rollup2
SAYS THEY SAY IT WOULD REALLY

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:16.692 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON DISADVANTAGED

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:18.393 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND THAT WOULD MEAN

01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:19.995 region:rollup2
IN MANY WAYS MY DISTRICT

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:23.332 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T HAVE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:25.367 region:rollup2
GET FUNDING. I ALSO THINK THAT A

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:27.269 region:rollup2
IF YOU LEAVE IT UP TO INDIVIDUAL

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:29.271 region:rollup2
US SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO EITHER

01:23:27.269 --> 01:23:30.239 region:rollup2
SEEK OUT THE FUNDING APPLY FOR

01:23:29.271 --> 01:23:32.574 region:rollup2
THE GRANTS.

01:23:30.239 --> 01:23:34.343 region:rollup2
OR OF BE INTERESTED IN THE SOME

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:36.378 region:rollup2
WILL AND SOME WON'T SO YOU'RE

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:38.647 region:rollup2
GONNA ALSO HAVE THAT. THAT

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:40.215 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY UP MAY BE TAKEN

01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:42.618 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE DISTRICT SAYS THIS

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:44.186 region:rollup2
IS NOT IMPORTANT TO US OR WE

01:23:42.618 --> 01:23:45.587 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS FOR IT OR

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:47.155 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE GRANT

01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:49.258 region:rollup2
SO THAT AGAIN SOME DISTRICTS

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:51.760 region:rollup2
HAVE MANY MORE TOOLS. THAN

01:23:49.258 --> 01:23:54.863 region:rollup2
OTHERS WHETHER THEY HAVE A HIRED

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.131 region:rollup2
A GRANT WRITER WHETHER THEY YEAH

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:58.367 region:rollup2
YEAH AND THESE ARE ALL LITTLE

01:23:56.131 --> 01:24:00.435 region:rollup2
NUANCES BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:01.637 region:rollup2
TO FUNDING SOMEBODY HAS MORE AN

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:03.205 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

01:24:01.637 --> 01:24:05.474 region:rollup2
FULL TIME GRANT WRITER ON THEIR

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:07.342 region:rollup2
STAFF. OR IF YOU HAVE PARENTS

01:24:05.474 --> 01:24:09.811 region:rollup2
WHO ARE VERY VERY VOCAL ABOUT

01:24:07.342 --> 01:24:10.712 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT BE THEATER ARTS AWARD

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:12.347 region:rollup2
DANCE OR.

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:13.982 region:rollup2
SPORTS AND THEY'RE PUSHING FOR

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:16.652 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF.

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:19.721 region:rollup2
I EMPHASIS ON FUNDING THEY MAY

01:24:16.652 --> 01:24:21.590 region:rollup2
NOT SPEAK UP ABOUT C. T. E. AND

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:22.624 region:rollup2
AGAIN IF IT SEEMS AS IF THEY'RE

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:24.660 region:rollup2
NOT INTERESTED IN THEY DON'T

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:26.528 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD WITH. APPLYING

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:28.096 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE MAY OR MAY HAVE IT MAY

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:29.932 region:rollup2
NOT BE THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:31.566 region:rollup2
BUT IT MAY BE IF YOU HAVE YOU

01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:33.535 region:rollup2
KNOW A THOUSAND STUDENTS MAYBE

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:35.103 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS. THAT DON'T

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:36.538 region:rollup2
GET SERVE BECAUSE THEY EITHER

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:38.040 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT

01:24:36.538 --> 01:24:40.108 region:rollup2
PARENTS AREN'T ADVOCATING FOR

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:42.177 region:rollup2
THEM THERE COULD BE NO INTEREST

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:44.179 region:rollup2
BY THE SCHOOL BOARD SO I REALLY

01:24:42.177 --> 01:24:46.815 region:rollup2
WHATEVER MODEL IS CHOSEN I THINK

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:48.150 region:rollup2
AS A BODY. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:49.851 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A GROUP OF

01:24:48.150 --> 01:24:51.853 region:rollup2
STUDENTS OUT THERE THAT THRIVE

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:53.422 region:rollup2
IN THIS TYPE OF SETTING THERE IS

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:55.257 region:rollup2
A GROUP OF STUDENTS THAT.

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:56.525 region:rollup2
LEAVE HIGH SCHOOL AND

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:58.427 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY.

01:24:56.525 --> 01:24:59.795 region:rollup2
WANT TO GO INTO SOME TYPE OF

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:01.530 region:rollup2
PROFESSION WHETHER IT'S A PRE

01:24:59.795 --> 01:25:04.166 region:rollup2
NURSING WHERE THEY'RE LIKE YOU

01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:05.968 region:rollup2
SAY CONSTRUCTION. AND THE WE

01:25:04.166 --> 01:25:08.604 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE FOR

01:25:05.968 --> 01:25:10.739 region:rollup2
THEM THAT IS NOT THE SECONDARY

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:11.373 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE IT'S KIND OF LIKE

01:25:10.739 --> 01:25:12.074 region:rollup2
WELL IF WE HAVE MONEY WILL FUND

01:25:11.373 --> 01:25:13.609 region:rollup2
IT.

01:25:12.074 --> 01:25:15.811 region:rollup2
THIS HAS TO BE PART OF WHAT WE

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:17.779 region:rollup2
DO BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY IS

01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:20.048 region:rollup2
GOING TO GO TO A TWO YEAR. OR

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:22.217 region:rollup2
FOUR YEAR AND BOTTOM LINE IS WE

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:24.152 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY VERY TALENTED PEOPLE.

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:27.322 region:rollup2
THAT GO INTO TRADES THAT GO

01:25:24.152 --> 01:25:28.824 region:rollup2
INTO A BUSINESS MODELS AND THEY

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:30.892 region:rollup2
SUCCEED THERE AND WE HAVE MANY

01:25:28.824 --> 01:25:33.095 region:rollup2
MANY YOUNG STUDENTS TRYING OUT

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:34.997 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SOMETIMES

01:25:33.095 --> 01:25:36.765 region:rollup2
FOR FIVE AND SIX YEARS. KIND OF

01:25:34.997 --> 01:25:38.500 region:rollup2
FLOUNDERING LOOKING FOR WHERE

01:25:36.765 --> 01:25:40.068 region:rollup2
THERE'S MOST DO IN IT AND MANY

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:42.004 region:rollup2
CASES THAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:43.505 region:rollup2
DO ELECTRICAL WORK WHATEVER THAT

01:25:42.004 --> 01:25:45.073 region:rollup2
IS THAT'S KILLER TRADE BUT

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:47.943 region:rollup2
THEY'VE KIND OF BEEN. PUSHED

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:49.144 region:rollup2
INTO A DIFFERENT SETTING SO.

01:25:47.943 --> 01:25:50.979 region:rollup2
IT'S MAKING SURE THAT WE REALLY

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:53.482 region:rollup2
PUSH THAT WE KEEP THAT THERE'S

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:55.417 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF FAIR ADVANTAGE.

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:56.318 region:rollup2
THAT DOES NOT ELIMINATE A WHOLE

01:25:55.417 --> 01:25:57.486 region:rollup2
GROUP OF.

01:25:56.318 --> 01:26:00.088 region:rollup2
STUDENTS FROM DISTRICT TO

01:25:57.486 --> 01:26:01.790 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:26:00.088 --> 01:26:02.457 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AYE NEXT DOCTOR WEBER.

01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:03.859 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:05.293 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I

01:26:03.859 --> 01:26:06.828 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS

01:26:05.293 --> 01:26:08.430 region:rollup2
IN THEM.

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:09.197 region:rollup2
AND AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES COME

01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:11.266 region:rollup2
IT'S IN SOME WAS LIKE THIS IS

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:12.434 region:rollup2
THE HOME RELIVING OF FIVE YEARS

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:14.936 region:rollup2
AGO WHAT LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

01:26:12.434 --> 01:26:15.470 region:rollup2
FORMULA. THOSE WHO REMEMBER THAT

01:26:14.936 --> 01:26:17.039 region:rollup2
AND.

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:19.074 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I

01:26:17.039 --> 01:26:19.274 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE A REST IN THE FACT

01:26:19.074 --> 01:26:20.676 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:22.844 region:rollup2
.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:24.513 region:rollup2
THAT TOLD CONCEPT OF L. CFF WAS

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:25.380 region:rollup2
NEVER FULLY COMPLETED BECAUSE IT

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.848 region:rollup2
NEVER HAD A STRONG

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:29.084 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY DOCUMENT ATTACHED

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:29.918 region:rollup2
TO IT. NOW THE THE DASHBOARD IS

01:26:29.084 --> 01:26:31.753 region:rollup2
AN EFFORT TO MOVE IN THAT

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:33.321 region:rollup2
DIRECTION AND AND PROBABLY CITY

01:26:31.753 --> 01:26:34.456 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE MORE DATA AND MORE

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:35.524 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IN TERMS OF

01:26:34.456 --> 01:26:37.359 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT SOME OF THE

01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:39.027 region:rollup2
OTHER. INDICATORS THAT WE HAVE

01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:39.628 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH ACADEMIC SINCE WHAT

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.662 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN TERMS OF WHAT DOES

01:26:39.628 --> 01:26:42.698 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY MEAN.

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:43.498 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S IT'S A IT'S

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:45.667 region:rollup2
THEM YOU KNOW THIS IS.

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:46.702 region:rollup2
A PROCESS IT SEEMS LIKE WE KEEP

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:48.303 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH OVER AND OVER

01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:49.905 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE

01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:51.440 region:rollup2
DID ALL CFF PEOPLE WANTED TO DO

01:26:49.905 --> 01:26:53.075 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL TO GIVE.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.342 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S HOW CTE CAME INTO

01:26:53.075 --> 01:26:56.244 region:rollup2
BEING WHERE PEOPLE HATE THE

01:26:54.342 --> 01:26:57.079 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL AS ALONG AS IT WAS

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:58.380 region:rollup2
TAKING UP THINGS THEY DIDN'T

01:26:57.079 --> 01:27:00.982 region:rollup2
LIKE BUT THAT PEOPLE IN THE

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:03.752 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THEY DID LIKE SO. YOU

01:27:00.982 --> 01:27:06.621 region:rollup2
ALSO THEY'RE IN A LIKE A CRISIS

01:27:03.752 --> 01:27:08.790 region:rollup2
OF IDENTITY WITH REGARDS TO LC

01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:11.493 region:rollup2
FF YOU KNOW YOU THE WONDERS OF

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:12.894 region:rollup2
LCF F.. THEN PEOPLE START SAY

01:27:11.493 --> 01:27:15.230 region:rollup2
BUT WE GO MAKE YOU DO THIS AND

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:17.566 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE ONGOING CHALLENGE

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:19.034 region:rollup2
WE DON'T SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY

01:27:17.566 --> 01:27:21.436 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HOPE IS AN OUTCOME FOR

01:27:19.034 --> 01:27:23.605 region:rollup2
ALL STUDENTS WITH REGARDS TO IT

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:25.407 region:rollup2
AND HOW DO WE MEASURE THAT IN

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:27.642 region:rollup2
THE VERY SCHOOLS THAT ARE THERE

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:30.579 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OTHERWISE. YOU'RE GONNA

01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:31.246 region:rollup2
FIND YOURSELF WITH THAT NUMBER

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:33.582 region:rollup2
OF ISSUES THAT ARE COMING

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:36.318 region:rollup2
FORWARD REAL SOON. WITH A

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:37.219 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ED OR SOMETHING OF THAT

01:27:36.318 --> 01:27:39.621 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES

01:27:37.219 --> 01:27:42.157 region:rollup2
ONCE AGAIN FACTOR THAT

01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:45.260 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL MODEL WHERE WE SAY

01:27:42.157 --> 01:27:47.362 region:rollup2
OKAY. YOU KNOW WE NEED THIS AND

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:49.064 region:rollup2
SINCE YOU DIDN'T DO IT WILL MAKE

01:27:47.362 --> 01:27:52.167 region:rollup2
YOU DO IT AND SO THAT WE COULD

01:27:49.064 --> 01:27:54.669 region:rollup2
DEVELOP A CATEGORICAL. AT

01:27:52.167 --> 01:27:56.738 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CATEGORICAL AND THEN

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:59.007 region:rollup2
WILL FIND US ALSO THIRTY

01:27:56.738 --> 01:28:00.475 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL LIKE WE DID BEFORE

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:02.477 region:rollup2
ON EVERY ISSUE YOU COULD

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:03.111 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY IMAGINE AND IN SCHOOLS

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:07.916 region:rollup2
COMPLAINING WHATEVER WE WANT TO

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:10.185 region:rollup2
CALL IT IT

01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:11.653 region:rollup2
HAS LIMITATIONS.

01:28:10.185 --> 01:28:12.554 region:rollup2
OF FOR A PERSON'S LIFE NOW WE

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:15.056 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT IS HAVING GREAT

01:28:12.554 --> 01:28:17.392 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY BUT OFTENTIMES

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:19.361 region:rollup2
UNLESS IT IS SOMETHING LIKE LINK

01:28:17.392 --> 01:28:20.862 region:rollup2
LEARNING AND IDYLLWILD WE HAVE

01:28:19.361 --> 01:28:21.429 region:rollup2
MOVED TO LINK LEARNING READ THAN

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:21.897 region:rollup2
CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION.

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:23.798 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:28:21.897 --> 01:28:25.867 region:rollup2
IN THOSE CASES YOU GET STRONG

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:26.501 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC FOUNDATION.

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:28.270 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THINGS YOU LEARN IN

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:29.504 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IS THAT THE ONLY REAL

01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:30.939 region:rollup2
SKILLS WE HAVE THAT WILL LAST

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:32.240 region:rollup2
FOR TIMES READING AND MATH AND

01:28:30.939 --> 01:28:33.975 region:rollup2
COMPUTATION.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.744 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOU AND IF YOU DON'T

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:37.279 region:rollup2
HAVE GOOD SKILLS AT THAT LEVEL.

01:28:35.744 --> 01:28:38.980 region:rollup2
IF ANYTHING WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

01:28:37.279 --> 01:28:40.348 region:rollup2
TO DO IS GONNA BE SHORT LIVED

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.650 region:rollup2
BECAUSE GOING TO CHANGE TOMORROW

01:28:40.348 --> 01:28:43.185 region:rollup2
WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT'S COME WITH

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:44.486 region:rollup2
SOMETHING NEW COMING ALONG AS TO

01:28:43.185 --> 01:28:46.188 region:rollup2
HOW YOU MEASURE SOMETHING OF

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:48.023 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU PUT IN PLACE A HOW YOU

01:28:46.188 --> 01:28:49.591 region:rollup2
DEVELOP SOMETHING. AND SO WOULD

01:28:48.023 --> 01:28:50.392 region:rollup2
NOT EQUIPPING OUR STUDENTS WITH

01:28:49.591 --> 01:28:52.260 region:rollup2
REALLY STRONG.

01:28:50.392 --> 01:28:53.528 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC FOUNDATIONS THAT ARE

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:55.730 region:rollup2
MEASURED AND SOMETIMES

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:57.599 region:rollup2
MANIFESTED IN THESE VARIOUS

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:58.633 region:rollup2
CAREER OPTIONS AND CHOICES. UP

01:28:57.599 --> 01:29:01.203 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE SHORT LIVED IT'S

01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:02.637 region:rollup2
GONNA BE IT'S GONNA BE LIKE OLD

01:29:01.203 --> 01:29:05.340 region:rollup2
TO OF. THE BOOK IT PROGRAM THAT

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:06.508 region:rollup2
MOST OF YOU TALK ABOUT HOW

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:10.579 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL IT WAS A CHIU DRILLED

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:11.580 region:rollup2
HOLES MADE ESTRACE BUT.

01:29:10.579 --> 01:29:13.682 region:rollup2
THEY WE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:15.650 region:rollup2
HER IN SO AS A RESULT REGARDLESS

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:17.285 region:rollup2
SO BOMB. AND WHAT I SAY ESTRACE

01:29:15.650 --> 01:29:19.754 region:rollup2
KIDS GOING ON TIME BUT NOWADAYS

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:20.088 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS ASKED FOR

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:21.122 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE BUT.

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:22.524 region:rollup2
.

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:23.091 region:rollup2
BUT SO I'M WONDERING WHY WE

01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:24.559 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T MOVED OUR THINKING

01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:25.193 region:rollup2
TOWARD WILL BUT LINK LEARNING

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:25.760 region:rollup2
MODEL. NOW THAT LINK LEARNS

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.761 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE THE OTHER DAY IN

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.430 region:rollup2
TERMS OF YOU KNOW YOU DEAL WITH

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:29.564 region:rollup2
THE CAREER OPTIONS YOU DEAL WITH

01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:30.765 region:rollup2
A SOFT SKILL WHICH ALSO DEAL

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:31.900 region:rollup2
WITH THE HAS STRONG ACADEMIC

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:34.102 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION. SO THAT WHEN A

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:35.537 region:rollup2
STUDENT GRADUATES THEY HAVE THEY

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:37.405 region:rollup2
HAVE THEIR WE HAVE ALL THESE

01:29:35.537 --> 01:29:38.707 region:rollup2
CAREERS IN THE CREEK PATHWAYS

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:40.008 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE THIS WHOLE ARRAY

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:41.276 region:rollup2
OF STUFF THAT'S AVAILABLE TO

01:29:40.008 --> 01:29:42.344 region:rollup2
THEM. AND AND I THINK AS LONG AS

01:29:41.276 --> 01:29:45.280 region:rollup2
WE KEEP THE TERMINOLOGY CAREER

01:29:42.344 --> 01:29:49.818 region:rollup2
TECH EDUCATION WE WE SOMETIMES

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:51.219 region:rollup2
SHORT CHANGE OUR KNOWLEDGE.

01:29:49.818 --> 01:29:53.255 region:rollup2
SEE THAT LOOK WHAT HAPPENED

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:54.022 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:29:53.255 --> 01:29:54.890 region:rollup2
TO WHOM WE SHORT CHANGE OUR

01:29:54.022 --> 01:29:56.358 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:58.894 region:rollup2
MOVING TO IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT

01:29:56.358 --> 01:29:59.794 region:rollup2
IS OUT THERE BECAUSE. YOU I HAVE

01:29:58.894 --> 01:30:01.062 region:rollup2
A LOT OF KIDS WHO WANT ONE TO AN

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:02.564 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND WHO.

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:03.565 region:rollup2
BUT THEY HAVE SUCH POOR MATH

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:06.334 region:rollup2
SKILLS.

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:09.404 region:rollup2
BUT THEY CAN'T QUALIFY FOR A. B.

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:11.039 region:rollup2
A PROGRAM AND THAT'S SOUNDS UP

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:12.741 region:rollup2
APTLY HORRIBLE BUT THE STANDARDS

01:30:11.039 --> 01:30:14.609 region:rollup2
ARE HIGH NOW. AND SHOW SO WE'RE

01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:15.577 region:rollup2
NOT IF WE KEEP THE OLD MODEL AND

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:16.878 region:rollup2
WE KEEP MIDDLE CLASS IN A CLASS

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:18.713 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN THE INTEGRATION OF

01:30:16.878 --> 01:30:21.082 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM THAT HAPPENS IN A. IN

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:21.850 region:rollup2
A LINK LEARNING ENVIRONMENT.

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:22.484 region:rollup2
.

01:30:21.850 --> 01:30:24.286 region:rollup2
I THINK WE SHOULD CHANGE OUR

01:30:22.484 --> 01:30:25.253 region:rollup2
KIDS AND I DON'T THINK WOULD DO

01:30:24.286 --> 01:30:26.855 region:rollup2
IN THIS WONDERFUL CAREER

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:28.323 region:rollup2
PREPARATION STUFF THAT WE THINK

01:30:26.855 --> 01:30:30.225 region:rollup2
WE'RE MOVING INTO. BIKE BY

01:30:28.323 --> 01:30:31.660 region:rollup2
CONFLICT TALKING ABOUT IT IN

01:30:30.225 --> 01:30:33.261 region:rollup2
THIS WAY AS A COURSE IN OF

01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:35.196 region:rollup2
COURSE THERE RATHER THAN A WHOLE

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:36.097 region:rollup2
WAY OF THINKING THAT EXIST ON

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:37.165 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS WITH REGARDS TO

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:38.800 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM AND. AND THE

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:40.402 region:rollup2
INTEGRATION OF THAT CURRICULUM

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.770 region:rollup2
INTO THE CAREERS IN THE PATHWAYS

01:30:40.402 --> 01:30:44.139 region:rollup2
AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT ALSO

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:45.507 region:rollup2
VERY STRONG FOUNDATIONS A WE GOT

01:30:44.139 --> 01:30:47.242 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM BOTH HIT BECAUSE IT

01:30:45.507 --> 01:30:48.877 region:rollup2
WAS A VERY LIMITING. AND OFTEN

01:30:47.242 --> 01:30:50.645 region:rollup2
IT WAS AS OUR CHAIR TALK ABOUT

01:30:48.877 --> 01:30:51.913 region:rollup2
TRACKING CERTAIN KIDS IT A

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:53.581 region:rollup2
PATHWAY THAT THEY COULDN'T GET

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:55.283 region:rollup2
OUT OF AND END UP AT THE END OF

01:30:53.581 --> 01:30:56.885 region:rollup2
THE LINE WITH VERY LIMITED

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:58.720 region:rollup2
SKILLS THEY COULD WORK FOR THAT.

01:30:56.885 --> 01:31:00.422 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:02.791 region:rollup2
MEETING THE NEEDS WITHIN ONE

01:31:00.422 --> 01:31:06.328 region:rollup2
THAT PROFESSION CHANGE THEIR

01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:07.095 region:rollup2
SHIFT IT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:31:06.328 --> 01:31:07.796 region:rollup2
SKILLS TO SHIFT WITH THE.

01:31:07.095 --> 01:31:08.830 region:rollup2
SO I HOPE THAT OUR THINKING GETS

01:31:07.796 --> 01:31:09.497 region:rollup2
BIGGER THAN WHERE WE ARE THAT IT

01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:10.231 region:rollup2
REALLY STARTS IMPACTING THE FULL

01:31:09.497 --> 01:31:10.432 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM.

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:12.100 region:rollup2
AND.

01:31:10.432 --> 01:31:14.135 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE REALLY START

01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:15.470 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT LINK LEARNING AND

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:16.338 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE LINK UP THESE THINGS

01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:18.673 region:rollup2
ALL SCHOOLS THAT HAVE DONE LINK

01:31:16.338 --> 01:31:20.241 region:rollup2
LEARNING HAVE AMAZING RESULTS.

01:31:18.673 --> 01:31:21.576 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:24.012 region:rollup2
THEIR ACTIONS WHEN THEY LEAVE.

01:31:21.576 --> 01:31:25.680 region:rollup2
A AND AND WHAT THEY CAN DO AND

01:31:24.012 --> 01:31:27.716 region:rollup2
AND AND AND AND THE WORLD IS

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:29.985 region:rollup2
CHANGING SO RAPIDLY. THAT THOSE

01:31:27.716 --> 01:31:32.153 region:rollup2
TWO SKILLS OF THIS COMPUTATIONAL

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:34.022 region:rollup2
SKILLS. AND EURO OF LITERACY

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:36.091 region:rollup2
SKILLS ARE TO THE TWO SKILLS

01:31:34.022 --> 01:31:38.159 region:rollup2
THAT WORK YOU THROUGH LIFE RIGHT

01:31:36.091 --> 01:31:39.260 region:rollup2
NOW. A AND GOT WILL AND AND MOST

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:41.763 region:rollup2
OF OUR KIDS WILL CHANGE

01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:43.465 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONS A ZILLION TIMES I'M

01:31:41.763 --> 01:31:44.399 region:rollup2
A PROBABLY A DINOSAUR ANYONE

01:31:43.465 --> 01:31:45.767 region:rollup2
ABOUT A PROFESSION FOR FORTY

01:31:44.399 --> 01:31:48.136 region:rollup2
YEARS. UP THEIR PART WILL BE

01:31:45.767 --> 01:31:49.804 region:rollup2
MANY OF THOSE LEFT IN THE WORLD

01:31:48.136 --> 01:31:50.438 region:rollup2
UP BECAUSE OUR FOLKS OF THAT

01:31:49.804 --> 01:31:51.940 region:rollup2
YOUNG PEOPLE GOING TO CHANGE SO

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:53.641 region:rollup2
OFTEN. AND THEY SHOULD HAVE THE

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:55.877 region:rollup2
SKILLS TO ADAPT AND CHANGE AND

01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:57.278 region:rollup2
TO RECREATE THEMSELVES A BASED

01:31:55.877 --> 01:31:57.979 region:rollup2
ON THE INTEREST THAT THEY HAVE

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:59.547 region:rollup2
BEEN BASED ON THE CHANGING

01:31:57.979 --> 01:32:01.349 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE. SO I'M JUST HOPING

01:31:59.547 --> 01:32:04.919 region:rollup2
THAT AS WE TALK CT <u><c.green>%</c></u>

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:05.520 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THAT WE REALLY MOVE TO

01:32:04.919 --> 01:32:06.855 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.689 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE DON'T SEE THIS AS

01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:09.758 region:rollup2
SUCH A LIMITED THING BUT THAT IT

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:11.559 region:rollup2
IS REALLY INCORPORATED. IN ALL

01:32:09.758 --> 01:32:13.128 region:rollup2
OF THE COURSES AND THE WHOLE K.

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:14.963 region:rollup2
TWELVE SYSTEM.

01:32:13.128 --> 01:32:15.997 region:rollup2
THAT HELPS YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY

01:32:14.963 --> 01:32:20.168 region:rollup2
DEFINE WHAT THEY WANTED TO IN

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:23.004 region:rollup2
THEIR LIFE WITHOUT LIMITATIONS.

01:32:20.168 --> 01:32:24.939 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THOMAS BURKE.

01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:26.107 region:rollup2
AND SO I WOULD AGREE WITH DOCTOR

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:27.442 region:rollup2
WEBER AND THAT MY MOM ALWAYS

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:29.511 region:rollup2
TOLD ME WHATEVER I WOULD END UP

01:32:27.442 --> 01:32:30.612 region:rollup2
DOING I PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD

01:32:29.511 --> 01:32:33.314 region:rollup2
OF TODAY.

01:32:30.612 --> 01:32:35.116 region:rollup2
AND I AM PERSONALLY RIGHT NOW

01:32:33.314 --> 01:32:37.552 region:rollup2
SHE'S WRONG TO THEM EXACTLY

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:38.486 region:rollup2
WHERE SHE STARTED.

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:40.488 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW RYAN AND LET THEM

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:42.123 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS EXACTLY SHE

01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:44.626 region:rollup2
WAS WERE AND I WAS BORN SO.

01:32:42.123 --> 01:32:45.994 region:rollup2
THAT MAY NOT APPLY TO ME BUT. I

01:32:44.626 --> 01:32:47.095 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH DOCTOR WEBER IN THE

01:32:45.994 --> 01:32:49.464 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THAT PROBABLY APPLIES

01:32:47.095 --> 01:32:52.567 region:rollup2
TO MOST YOUNG PEOPLE HOWEVER I

01:32:49.464 --> 01:32:54.369 region:rollup2
WILL SAY I DO THEY HAVE TO. KIND

01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:57.105 region:rollup2
OF GO THE OTHER DIRECTION ON ON

01:32:54.369 --> 01:32:57.572 region:rollup2
THE SHORT LIVED PART OF IT I

01:32:57.105 --> 01:32:58.540 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:32:57.572 --> 01:32:59.707 region:rollup2
I I COME FROM A COMMUNITY THAT

01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:01.743 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE HAVE A

01:32:59.707 --> 01:33:03.278 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION THAT ALTHOUGH MAY

01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:04.479 region:rollup2
NOT BE PERMANENT AND MAY BE.

01:33:03.278 --> 01:33:06.014 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY SHORT LIVED ENOUGH

01:33:04.479 --> 01:33:08.450 region:rollup2
THAT'S TEN YEARS OR FIFTEEN

01:33:06.014 --> 01:33:09.050 region:rollup2
YEARS WOULD. WOULD BE THANKFUL

01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:09.784 region:rollup2
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO START A

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:11.786 region:rollup2
LIFE.

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:13.588 region:rollup2
AND TO START A CAREER.

01:33:11.786 --> 01:33:15.123 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THE FACT

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:17.092 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:33:15.123 --> 01:33:18.993 region:rollup2
AND JOBS THAT ARE NOT FILLED

01:33:17.092 --> 01:33:20.795 region:rollup2
WITH CAREERS THAT WOULD BE A

01:33:18.993 --> 01:33:22.597 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION WOULD WOULD PUT

01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:24.432 region:rollup2
THEM IN AND PUT PUT THE KIDS

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:26.501 region:rollup2
INTO. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES WHERE

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:27.902 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BUY A HOME WITH A START

01:33:26.501 --> 01:33:28.403 region:rollup2
AT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:33:27.902 --> 01:33:30.038 region:rollup2
YEAR AND THOSE ARE IN MY

01:33:28.403 --> 01:33:30.905 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THOSE ARE IT THOSE ARE.

01:33:30.038 --> 01:33:32.674 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL JOBS IF THEY JUST NEED

01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:34.509 region:rollup2
A CERTIFICATION AND I DO SEE

01:33:32.674 --> 01:33:35.877 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE BUSINESSES THAT ARE

01:33:34.509 --> 01:33:37.512 region:rollup2
STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND

01:33:35.877 --> 01:33:38.680 region:rollup2
CERTIFY THEMSELVES. BUT I DON'T

01:33:37.512 --> 01:33:40.415 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S BUSINESSES SOLE

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:41.583 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO FILL THEIR OWN

01:33:40.415 --> 01:33:42.617 region:rollup2
JOBS I THINK THAT WE HAVE A

01:33:41.583 --> 01:33:44.085 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CHILDREN

01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:47.155 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAD TO KATE TO CREATE

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:47.922 region:rollup2
THOSE JOBS. OUGHT TO CREATE

01:33:47.155 --> 01:33:49.791 region:rollup2
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM.

01:33:47.922 --> 01:33:51.159 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I LOOK AT MY WORKFORCE

01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:53.128 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT BOARD THEY'VE DONE A

01:33:51.159 --> 01:33:53.695 region:rollup2
FANTASTIC JOB CONNECTING AYE

01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:55.430 region:rollup2
EDUCATION WITH AEROSPACE OR

01:33:53.695 --> 01:33:57.565 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:59.067 region:rollup2
OR OR WITH MEDICAL INDUSTRY AND

01:33:57.565 --> 01:34:02.704 region:rollup2
ALL THESE OTHER THINGS.

01:33:59.067 --> 01:34:03.705 region:rollup2
I WILL SAY THIS I SAY TO THANKS.

01:34:02.704 --> 01:34:05.140 region:rollup2
ONE I THINK THE STUDY SHOULD

01:34:03.705 --> 01:34:06.508 region:rollup2
OCCUR TECHNICAL EDUCATION HAVE

01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:07.976 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO HAVE A

01:34:06.508 --> 01:34:09.911 region:rollup2
REASON TO GO TO SCHOOL. THEY

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:11.112 region:rollup2
HAVE IT'S APPLICABLE THEY SEE

01:34:09.911 --> 01:34:12.514 region:rollup2
WHEN THEIR SKILLS AYE IT WE SAY

01:34:11.112 --> 01:34:14.282 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE EA

01:34:12.514 --> 01:34:16.150 region:rollup2
SPORTS AND WE ALWAYS SAY MATH

01:34:14.282 --> 01:34:17.352 region:rollup2
LEADS TO MADDEN OF MORE MY KIDS

01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:18.620 region:rollup2
KNEW THAT GOING TO MATH CLASS

01:34:17.352 --> 01:34:20.588 region:rollup2
WOULD LEAD THEM TO BE ABLE TO

01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:21.523 region:rollup2
CREATE GAMES LIKE MADDEN. THEY'D

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:22.624 region:rollup2
SHOW UP.

01:34:21.523 --> 01:34:24.225 region:rollup2
AND SO I DON'T SEE IT AS A

01:34:22.624 --> 01:34:26.027 region:rollup2
LIMITED OPPORTUNITY CREW

01:34:24.225 --> 01:34:27.328 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL EDUCATION I SEE IT AS

01:34:26.027 --> 01:34:29.163 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY INTO THEM. TO

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:30.498 region:rollup2
KEEP KIDS ENGAGED TO KEEP YOUNG

01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:31.900 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ENGAGED IN TO WATCH THE

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:32.967 region:rollup2
MOVE INTO THE NEXT PHASE OF

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:34.302 region:rollup2
THEIR LIVES.

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:35.670 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER THAT IS A CAREER OR

01:34:34.302 --> 01:34:36.938 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT IS THE NEXT LEVEL

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:37.505 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATION I THINK IT'S

01:34:36.938 --> 01:34:38.773 region:rollup2
VITALLY IMPORTANT TO US THAT

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:40.141 region:rollup2
THE.

01:34:38.773 --> 01:34:41.442 region:rollup2
THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS GET THE

01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:42.210 region:rollup2
RPG DO THAT WHETHER WE ARE IN

01:34:41.442 --> 01:34:43.978 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED MEANS OUR

01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:46.748 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES. IN WHICH THERE ARE

01:34:43.978 --> 01:34:48.049 region:rollup2
JUST JOB OPPORTUNITIES.

01:34:46.748 --> 01:34:50.218 region:rollup2
I'M I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION AND I

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:51.019 region:rollup2
DO AT TWO QUESTIONS ACTUALLY ONE

01:34:50.218 --> 01:34:53.188 region:rollup2
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:34:51.019 --> 01:34:54.656 region:rollup2
WHAT? ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL

01:34:53.188 --> 01:34:56.257 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT

01:34:54.656 --> 01:34:57.525 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY A REGIONAL APPROACH

01:34:56.257 --> 01:34:59.093 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:01.029 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND I MIGHT HAVE MISSED

01:34:59.093 --> 01:35:02.096 region:rollup2
HEARD YOU. AND I WANNA MAKE SURE

01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:03.798 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS BY

01:35:02.096 --> 01:35:05.400 region:rollup2
WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS

01:35:03.798 --> 01:35:06.734 region:rollup2
DIVIDING UP THIS MONEY SO ARE

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:08.436 region:rollup2
YOU SAYING THAT THE MONEY WILL

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:10.438 region:rollup2
BE DIVIDED EQUALLY OVER EACH

01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:12.874 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM. OR HOW EXPLAIN TO ME

01:35:10.438 --> 01:35:14.275 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HOW YOU SEE THIS WORKING

01:35:12.874 --> 01:35:15.510 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE AYE I HEARD GRANT

01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:16.778 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BUT THEN I HEARD YOU SAY

01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:18.179 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE MOVING AWAY FROM

01:35:16.778 --> 01:35:19.414 region:rollup2
THE GRANT MODEL AND I JUST WANNA

01:35:18.179 --> 01:35:21.916 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND A HUNDRED

01:35:19.414 --> 01:35:24.419 region:rollup2
PERCENT. BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:25.186 region:rollup2
THINK YOU.

01:35:24.419 --> 01:35:26.321 region:rollup2
SO THIRTY AND THE FUNDING IS

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:27.755 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED TO THE CHANCELLOR'S

01:35:26.321 --> 01:35:29.290 region:rollup2
OFFICE WHO WILL THEN USE THE A

01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:31.926 region:rollup2
FORMULA TO DISTRIBUTE IT DOWN TO

01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:33.795 region:rollup2
THE CONSORTIA SO THE FORMULA IS.

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:35.096 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

01:35:33.795 --> 01:35:36.731 region:rollup2
IN THE REGION AND THE PROJECTED

01:35:35.096 --> 01:35:38.166 region:rollup2

REGION'S CONSORTIUM CONSORTIUM

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:45.773 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION WILL WILL VARY THAT

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:46.074 region:rollup2
BASED ON THAT FORMULA SAID IT'S

01:35:45.773 --> 01:35:51.145 region:rollup2
NOT A SET.

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:51.746 region:rollup2

OF THEM REGIONAL CONSORTIA I'M

01:38:00.441 --> 01:38:03.578 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO A REGIONAL PLAN AND

01:38:03.578 --> 01:38:06.614 region:rollup2
THEIR GOVERNANCE MODELS ABOUT IS

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:09.083 region:rollup2

LOCALLY BY THE REGION AND BUT

01:38:09.083 --> 01:38:13.354 region:rollup2
IT IS DESCRIBED IN THEIR PLANTS

01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:14.789 region:rollup2

GOVERNED ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:34.242 region:rollup2
RULES AND SO EACH CONSORTIA WILL

01:38:32.573 --> 01:38:35.376 region:rollup2
LOOK DIFFERENT. HAVE WHAT IS TO

01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:38.012 region:rollup2
PREVENT.

COMPLICATED ANSWER I THINK. AND

01:39:44.479 --> 01:39:46.681 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT I HAD ON EARLIER I

01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:47.982 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S REALLY WE'RE REALLY

01:39:46.681 --> 01:39:49.617 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO DIVE INTO THAT IN THE

01:39:47.982 --> 01:39:51.052 region:rollup2
IN BUDGET SUB TO FOR SURE

01:39:49.617 --> 01:39:52.286 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I

01:39:51.052 --> 01:39:53.754 region:rollup2
THINK EXPLAIN AGAIN AND I

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:55.056 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND. A

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:55.623 region:rollup2
THOMAS BURKE THEY'RE GONNA GIVE

01:39:55.056 --> 01:39:57.458 region:rollup2
THE MONEY TO CONSORTIUM MY

01:39:55.623 --> 01:39:59.093 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES HOUSING CONSORTIUM

01:39:57.458 --> 01:40:00.294 region:rollup2
GOING TO DELIVER SO I DON'T

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:01.495 region:rollup2
WANNA GET FURTHER IT TOO FAR TOO

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:02.563 region:rollup2
FAR INTO THAT RIGHT NOW IF YOU

01:40:01.495 --> 01:40:04.265 region:rollup2
COULD JUST GIVE A SHORT ANSWER

01:40:02.563 --> 01:40:05.299 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE MISTER KILEY.

01:40:04.265 --> 01:40:07.068 region:rollup2
WHO ARE RUNNING SIGNIFICANTLY

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:08.736 region:rollup2
BEHIND HER AS RIGHT NOW I'LL

01:40:07.068 --> 01:40:10.638 region:rollup2
JUST POINT OUT THAT I'M UNDER

01:40:08.736 --> 01:40:11.839 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING PROGRAM IN STATUTE

01:40:10.638 --> 01:40:14.075 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ARE REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:16.777 region:rollup2
THE CONSORTIUM COLLABORATE WITH

01:40:14.075 --> 01:40:18.312 region:rollup2
VARIOUS DIFFERENT DO YOU SO? I'M

EDUCATION IN THEIR REGION

01:40:20.515 --> 01:40:24.385 region:rollup2
ELEAZAR.

01:40:21.749 --> 01:40:25.753 region:rollup2
CIVIC LEADERS THAT THERE'S A

01:40:24.385 --> 01:40:28.389 region:rollup2
WHOLE HOST SO IT'S NOT

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:30.291 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:40:28.389 --> 01:40:34.962 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT WITHIN THE CONSORTIUM

01:40:30.291 --> 01:40:36.063 region:rollup2
IT REALLY AS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF

01:40:34.962 --> 01:40:36.964 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AT THAT POINT.

01:40:36.063 --> 01:40:37.565 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER KILEY WILL BE

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:38.332 region:rollup2
OUR OUR LAST QUESTION ON FOR

01:40:37.565 --> 01:40:39.600 region:rollup2
THIS PANEL.

01:40:38.332 --> 01:40:39.767 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.102 region:rollup2
MS.

01:40:39.767 --> 01:40:42.470 region:rollup2
COLLINS I SUED THE LA AS

01:40:41.102 --> 01:40:43.938 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE TAKE

01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:44.739 region:rollup2
CARE OF THE LCF APPROACH TO AYE.

01:40:43.938 --> 01:40:46.541 region:rollup2
TO.

01:40:44.739 --> 01:40:47.308 region:rollup2
CT AND CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE

01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:47.975 region:rollup2
MORE WITHOUT DETAIL YOU

01:40:47.308 --> 01:40:48.175 region:rollup2
BASICALLY RECOMMENDING THAT WE

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:48.643 region:rollup2
JUST.

01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:50.544 region:rollup2
AUGMENT.

01:40:48.643 --> 01:40:51.178 region:rollup2
THAT THE FUNDING TO WHATEVER

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:52.113 region:rollup2
DEGREE.

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:54.582 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

01:40:52.113 --> 01:40:56.751 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I SEE HOW THEY DO BY

01:40:54.582 --> 01:40:58.452 region:rollup2
THE COLLAGEN ENCOURAGING THIS

01:40:56.751 --> 01:40:59.620 region:rollup2
INDICATOR.

01:40:58.452 --> 01:41:01.255 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:03.457 region:rollup2
.

01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:05.192 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:06.527 region:rollup2
TAKING THE LC FF APPROACH WHICH

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:08.496 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SIXTEEN PERCENT MORE

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:10.631 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL

01:41:08.496 --> 01:41:12.466 region:rollup2
BASE RATE. I'M TO ACCOUNT FOR

01:41:10.631 --> 01:41:14.669 region:rollup2
THE HIGHER COSTS OF THINGS LIKE.

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:17.104 region:rollup2
CREW TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND.

01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:18.506 region:rollup2
COLLEGE PREPAREDNESS THIS IS

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:19.907 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINAL APPROACH THAT THE

01:41:18.506 --> 01:41:21.275 region:rollup2
STATE DETERMINED AT WHICH TO

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:23.544 region:rollup2
TAKE FOR CT <u><c.green>.</c></u>

01:41:21.275 --> 01:41:24.979 region:rollup2
BACK IN A TWENTY TWELVE OR

01:41:23.544 --> 01:41:26.080 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WE

01:41:24.979 --> 01:41:27.615 region:rollup2
ADOPTED THE LOCAL CONTROL

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:29.684 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA THE THOUGHT

01:41:27.615 --> 01:41:31.619 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THAT FOR MANY OF THE

01:41:29.684 --> 01:41:32.820 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS GIFTED AND

01:41:31.619 --> 01:41:34.522 region:rollup2
TALENTED.

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:37.058 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:41:34.522 --> 01:41:39.560 region:rollup2
CT  <u><c.green>THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING</c></u>

01:41:37.058 --> 01:41:41.062 region:rollup2
DISTINCT EARMARKED FUNDING FOR

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:42.897 region:rollup2
THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD

01:41:41.062 --> 01:41:44.565 region:rollup2
REQUIRE DISTRICTS TO.

01:41:42.897 --> 01:41:46.567 region:rollup2
PERFORM A LOT OF COMPLEX

01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:47.268 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE BASED ACTIVITIES THAT

01:41:46.567 --> 01:41:49.637 region:rollup2
CREATED.

01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:51.505 region:rollup2
INEQUITABLE FUNDING ACROSS

01:41:49.637 --> 01:41:53.174 region:rollup2
DISTRICT BASED ON HISTORICAL.

01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:55.843 region:rollup2
.

01:41:53.174 --> 01:41:57.111 region:rollup2
VARIABLES THAT BE LCF APPROACH

01:41:55.843 --> 01:41:58.346 region:rollup2
WOULD PROVIDE MORE FUNDING TO

01:41:57.111 --> 01:42:00.181 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BASED ON WHETHER THEY

01:41:58.346 --> 01:42:01.549 region:rollup2
WERE LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNERS

01:42:00.181 --> 01:42:03.417 region:rollup2
ARE FOSTER YOU.

01:42:01.549 --> 01:42:04.251 region:rollup2
AND THE THOUGHT WAS INSTEAD OF

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:06.153 region:rollup2
DECIDING.

01:42:04.251 --> 01:42:08.089 region:rollup2
HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHAT LOCAL

01:42:06.153 --> 01:42:09.657 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES WOULD BE WE WOULD

01:42:08.089 --> 01:42:12.860 region:rollup2
WILL ALLOW THE LOCAL SET ASIDE

01:42:09.657 --> 01:42:13.694 region:rollup2
THROUGH. ON THE AL CAPP PROCESS

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:14.729 region:rollup2
WHERE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING

01:42:13.694 --> 01:42:16.097 region:rollup2
PARENTS AND TEACHERS AND OTHERS

01:42:14.729 --> 01:42:16.964 region:rollup2
WOULD COME TO THE TABLE AND

01:42:16.097 --> 01:42:18.466 region:rollup2
DETERMINE HOW THEY WOULD SERVE

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:20.735 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:42:18.466 --> 01:42:23.604 region:rollup2
TO BE NOT ONLY COLLEGE AND

01:42:20.735 --> 01:42:25.406 region:rollup2
CAREER READY BUT ALSO ENGAGED.

01:42:23.604 --> 01:42:26.741 region:rollup2
AT WE HAVE A WE HAVE EIGHT

01:42:25.406 --> 01:42:27.274 region:rollup2
STATE PRIORITIES THAT WE WE

01:42:26.741 --> 01:42:28.409 region:rollup2
WANTED SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:42:27.274 --> 01:42:30.044 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

01:42:28.409 --> 01:42:31.479 region:rollup2
SO WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATION IS

01:42:30.044 --> 01:42:33.047 region:rollup2
FOR FOR MANY OF THE.

01:42:31.479 --> 01:42:34.248 region:rollup2
.

01:42:33.047 --> 01:42:35.883 region:rollup2
FOR MANY OF THE REASONS THAT

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:37.618 region:rollup2
THAT US SOME OF THE MEMBERS

01:42:35.883 --> 01:42:39.654 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP TODAY CONCERNS THAT

01:42:37.618 --> 01:42:41.389 region:rollup2
NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO APPLY

01:42:39.654 --> 01:42:42.890 region:rollup2
FOR A GRANT FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT

01:42:41.389 --> 01:42:44.625 region:rollup2
OUR RECOMMENDATION IS IS THROUGH

01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:46.460 region:rollup2
THE LC FF THE EXPECTATION IS

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:48.629 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYONE PERFORMS COLLEGE

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:50.398 region:rollup2
AND CAREER READINESS ACTIVITIES?

01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:51.499 region:rollup2
WE HOLD EVERYBODY ACCOUNTABLE

01:42:50.398 --> 01:42:53.034 region:rollup2
NOT JUST THOSE THAT ARE

01:42:51.499 --> 01:42:55.236 region:rollup2
RECEIVING FUNDS FOR IT AS WE DID

01:42:53.034 --> 01:42:56.237 region:rollup2
UNDER THE RCP DAYS BUT THE BUT

01:42:55.236 --> 01:42:58.372 region:rollup2
EVERY HIGH SCHOOL WAS HELD

01:42:56.237 --> 01:42:59.774 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE THROUGH THE.

01:42:58.372 --> 01:43:01.208 region:rollup2
NEW ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM.

01:42:59.774 --> 01:43:02.877 region:rollup2
THE NEW ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM

01:43:01.208 --> 01:43:04.011 region:rollup2
HAS TAKEN AWHILE TO ROLL OUT

01:43:02.877 --> 01:43:05.246 region:rollup2
THERE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:07.081 region:rollup2
INDICATORS RIGHT WITHOUT A

01:43:05.246 --> 01:43:08.215 region:rollup2
TRANSITION PERIOD BECAUSE WE

01:43:07.081 --> 01:43:10.584 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE FULL IMPLEMENTATION

01:43:08.215 --> 01:43:11.852 region:rollup2
OF ALL CFF THAT PROVIDE THAT

01:43:10.584 --> 01:43:13.554 region:rollup2
EXTRA FUNDING FOR HIGH SCHOOLS.

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:15.189 region:rollup2
I OR ANYONE ACTUALLY ON THAT

01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:16.323 region:rollup2
WASN'T FULLY FUNDED FOR ANY I'M

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:18.292 region:rollup2
GREAT SPAN.

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:19.960 region:rollup2
SO OUR OUR RECOMMENDATION IS

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:22.697 region:rollup2
CONTEST TO CONTINUE DOWN THAT

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:23.564 region:rollup2
PATH OF REQUIRING EVERYONE TO

01:43:22.697 --> 01:43:25.099 region:rollup2
PROVIDE CAREER TECHNICAL

01:43:23.564 --> 01:43:27.334 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND HOLDING THEM

01:43:25.099 --> 01:43:28.636 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT. SO I GUESS I

01:43:27.334 --> 01:43:29.804 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE IS THAT THE WAY THE

01:43:28.636 --> 01:43:31.072 region:rollup2
INDICATORS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IS

01:43:29.804 --> 01:43:31.972 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY DO THAT

01:43:31.072 --> 01:43:33.541 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE IS THAT YOU CAN

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:35.409 region:rollup2
SATISFY THIS INDICATOR THROUGH A

01:43:33.541 --> 01:43:36.977 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF. MEANS THAT THAT

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:39.113 region:rollup2
DON'T NECESSARILY INCLUDE ANY

01:43:36.977 --> 01:43:39.680 region:rollup2
VOCATIONAL OFFERING AT ALL IS

01:43:39.113 --> 01:43:41.682 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT RIGHT.

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:44.285 region:rollup2
YES WE AGREE THAT IF THE

01:43:41.682 --> 01:43:46.253 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS CONCERNS WITH

01:43:44.285 --> 01:43:47.621 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IT COULD MAKE

01:43:46.253 --> 01:43:49.390 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE INDICATOR.

01:43:47.621 --> 01:43:52.093 region:rollup2
STATE BOARD IS PLANNING TO ADD

01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:53.461 region:rollup2
OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS MORE

01:43:52.093 --> 01:43:56.097 region:rollup2
CAREER EDUCATION.

01:43:53.461 --> 01:43:57.698 region:rollup2
METRICS INTO THE INDICATOR

01:43:56.097 --> 01:43:58.599 region:rollup2
INCLUDING WORK BASED LEARNING.

01:43:57.698 --> 01:44:01.035 region:rollup2
AND.

01:43:58.599 --> 01:44:02.136 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATES BUT WE BELIEVE

01:44:01.035 --> 01:44:03.771 region:rollup2
THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS ITS

01:44:02.136 --> 01:44:05.606 region:rollup2
CONCERNS IT CAN IT HAS THE POWER

01:44:03.771 --> 01:44:06.941 region:rollup2
TO. MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO

01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:08.109 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT VERY CONCERNED

01:44:06.941 --> 01:44:09.577 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S CONCERNED WE'VE

01:44:08.109 --> 01:44:10.644 region:rollup2
HEARD AS WELL BUT I WOULD NOTE

01:44:09.577 --> 01:44:12.646 region:rollup2
THAT WHILE THIS IS OUR

01:44:10.644 --> 01:44:13.848 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION WE WE RECOGNIZE

01:44:12.646 --> 01:44:15.516 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT

01:44:13.848 --> 01:44:17.184 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN CREATING. A

01:44:15.516 --> 01:44:18.986 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL AND EARMARKED

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:20.387 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHY IN OUR

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:22.356 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS WE PROVIDED.

01:44:20.387 --> 01:44:23.757 region:rollup2
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW

01:44:22.356 --> 01:44:25.159 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT STRUCTURE THAT WE

01:44:23.757 --> 01:44:26.727 region:rollup2
THINK THAT ACCOUNTABILITY EVEN

01:44:25.159 --> 01:44:28.329 region:rollup2
IF YOU TAKE A CATEGORICAL ROUTE

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:29.864 region:rollup2
IS REALLY IMPORTANT IMPROVING

01:44:28.329 --> 01:44:31.532 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND IF YOU TAKE

01:44:29.864 --> 01:44:33.100 region:rollup2
THE L. CFF ROUTE. WE HAVE SOME

01:44:31.532 --> 01:44:34.769 region:rollup2
IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT AS WELL

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:36.637 region:rollup2
INCLUDING.

01:44:34.769 --> 01:44:38.305 region:rollup2
LONGER TERM INDICATORS WE RIGHT

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:40.608 region:rollup2
NOW DON'T KNOW AFTER A STUDENT

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:41.909 region:rollup2
COMPLETES HIGH SCHOOL. IF SAY

01:44:40.608 --> 01:44:43.077 region:rollup2
GOING TO COMMITTEE COLLEGE INTO

01:44:41.909 --> 01:44:44.378 region:rollup2
A FOUR YEAR INTO AN

01:44:43.077 --> 01:44:46.247 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM.

01:44:44.378 --> 01:44:46.981 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK AT THE VERY LEAST

01:44:46.247 --> 01:44:48.916 region:rollup2
THOSE TYPES OF IMPROVEMENTS

01:44:46.981 --> 01:44:50.284 region:rollup2
COULD BE MADE OF NO MATTER WHAT

01:44:48.916 --> 01:44:51.719 region:rollup2
APPROACH YOU DECIDE TO TAKE

01:44:50.284 --> 01:44:52.920 region:rollup2
RIGHT YEAH I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I

01:44:51.719 --> 01:44:53.788 region:rollup2
SEE IS.

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.389 region:rollup2
THE TENSION HERE IS THAT.

01:44:53.788 --> 01:44:56.190 region:rollup2
.

01:44:55.389 --> 01:44:57.391 region:rollup2
I MEAN SEPARATE FROM THE

01:44:56.190 --> 01:44:58.659 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF ACCOUNTABILITY WE

01:44:57.391 --> 01:44:59.827 region:rollup2
DON'T REALLY SEEM TO HAVE ANY

01:44:58.659 --> 01:45:00.161 region:rollup2
VISION AS TO WHAT THE

01:44:59.827 --> 01:45:02.496 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

01:45:00.161 --> 01:45:03.898 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND GOAL IS OUT WE

01:45:02.496 --> 01:45:05.432 region:rollup2
SEEM TO HAVE SOME AGREEMENT MORE

01:45:03.898 --> 01:45:06.567 region:rollup2
CT WOULD BE GOOD.

01:45:05.432 --> 01:45:08.302 region:rollup2
BY.

01:45:06.567 --> 01:45:08.969 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERY

01:45:08.302 --> 01:45:10.237 region:rollup2
STUDENT SHOULD HAVE SOME

01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:10.838 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE TO IT DOES NOT MEAN

01:45:10.237 --> 01:45:11.672 region:rollup2
THAT EVERY STUDENT SHOULD HAVE

01:45:10.838 --> 01:45:12.907 region:rollup2
A.

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:14.441 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF CAREER OFFERINGS

01:45:12.907 --> 01:45:16.110 region:rollup2
WITHIN THEIR DISTRICT WITHIN

01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:17.278 region:rollup2
THEIR REGION AND DIE THERE

01:45:16.110 --> 01:45:18.846 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY CONSENSUS

01:45:17.278 --> 01:45:21.248 region:rollup2
ON THAT AND YET WERE.

01:45:18.846 --> 01:45:22.016 region:rollup2
DEBATING SORT OF WHAT'S THE

01:45:21.248 --> 01:45:23.918 region:rollup2
BEST FUNDING MECHANISM TOWARDS

01:45:22.016 --> 01:45:25.686 region:rollup2
AN. UNDEFINED GOAL.

01:45:23.918 --> 01:45:27.488 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT THE

01:45:25.686 --> 01:45:28.255 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS AYE

01:45:27.488 --> 01:45:30.157 region:rollup2
UNANSWERED ABOUT THAT'S TO KIND

01:45:28.255 --> 01:45:31.692 region:rollup2
OF WHAT. WHAT OUR VISION IS HERE

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:32.993 region:rollup2
BUT THE OTHER POINT ALL HAD IS

01:45:31.692 --> 01:45:34.595 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:36.263 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WEBER'S COMMENTS ARE

01:45:34.595 --> 01:45:37.231 region:rollup2
WORTH TAKING REALLY SERIOUSLY

01:45:36.263 --> 01:45:37.965 region:rollup2
AND PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT

01:45:37.231 --> 01:45:39.266 region:rollup2
IS TO BE A DIFFERENT

01:45:37.965 --> 01:45:40.834 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION OF WERE SITTING? IN

01:45:39.266 --> 01:45:42.870 region:rollup2
A STATE THAT HAS THE BEST K.

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:44.872 region:rollup2
TWELVE EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY.

01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:46.240 region:rollup2
AND WE DO HAVE MANY MANY

01:45:44.872 --> 01:45:47.474 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING SCHOOLS IN THE STATE

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:48.342 region:rollup2
BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE

01:45:47.474 --> 01:45:49.543 region:rollup2
WORST PERFORMANCE WHEN IT COMES

01:45:48.342 --> 01:45:50.377 region:rollup2
TO TRADITIONAL ECONOMIC

01:45:49.543 --> 01:45:52.213 region:rollup2
INDICATORS IN CASE THROUGH

01:45:50.377 --> 01:45:53.447 region:rollup2
TWELVE. AND WHEN YOU'RE

01:45:52.213 --> 01:45:55.282 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING CT  <u><c.green>OF</c></u>

01:45:53.447 --> 01:45:57.418 region:rollup2
OCCASIONAL EDUCATION IN THAT

01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:58.719 region:rollup2
CONTEXT THEN IT ALMOST SEEMS

01:45:57.418 --> 01:46:00.054 region:rollup2
LIKE SUMMER READY TO JUMP AT THE

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:01.422 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW AN

01:46:00.054 --> 01:46:04.158 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE AND IT CAN'T I DON'T

01:46:01.422 --> 01:46:04.758 region:rollup2
THINK BE. CONCEIVED OF THAT WAY

01:46:04.158 --> 01:46:07.695 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:09.630 region:rollup2
THAT THIS THAT THESE OFFERINGS

01:46:07.695 --> 01:46:11.332 region:rollup2
ARE VITAL TO HAVE AND I THINK

01:46:09.630 --> 01:46:12.700 region:rollup2
THAT EVERY GUY STUDENTS SHOULD

01:46:11.332 --> 01:46:15.069 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO VOCATIONAL

01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:17.738 region:rollup2
EDUCATION BUT I IT'S NOT A

01:46:15.069 --> 01:46:19.373 region:rollup2
SUBSTITUTE FOR BASIC. OTHER

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:22.376 region:rollup2
BASIC EDUCATION THAT EVERY CHILD

01:46:19.373 --> 01:46:24.511 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA I SHOULD BE

01:46:22.376 --> 01:46:25.446 region:rollup2
GUARANTEED A WERE FALLING FAR

01:46:24.511 --> 01:46:28.315 region:rollup2
FAR SHORT.

01:46:25.446 --> 01:46:30.851 region:rollup2
ON ON THIS MORE TRADITIONAL

01:46:28.315 --> 01:46:33.053 region:rollup2
METRICS I GUESS JUST DIED

01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:35.756 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THE CHAIR WANTS TO MOVE

01:46:33.053 --> 01:46:38.726 region:rollup2
ON BUT I'M. YOU YOU DID TALK

01:46:35.756 --> 01:46:39.293 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME OF THE METRICS WE

01:46:38.726 --> 01:46:45.799 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:46:39.293 --> 01:46:47.635 region:rollup2
FOR HOW CD PROGRAMS ARE DOING I

01:46:45.799 --> 01:46:52.673 region:rollup2
DO YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THOSE

01:46:47.635 --> 01:46:53.240 region:rollup2
ARE AND THEN WHETHER YOU'VE

01:46:52.673 --> 01:46:53.874 region:rollup2
NOTICED I'VE.

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:54.975 region:rollup2
WHETHER THERE'S ANY CORRELATION

01:46:53.874 --> 01:46:55.542 region:rollup2
BETWEEN DISTRICTS THAT DO WELL

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:56.443 region:rollup2
BY TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC HE

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:58.178 region:rollup2
TWELVE METRICS AND THOSE THAT DO

01:46:56.443 --> 01:46:59.146 region:rollup2
WELL I WOULD CT  <u><c.green>OR THOSE.</c></u>

01:46:58.178 --> 01:46:59.780 region:rollup2
I'M NOT NECESSARILY CORRELATED

01:46:59.146 --> 01:47:03.250 region:rollup2
REAP BRIEFLY PLEASE BECAUSE TEAM

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:06.053 region:rollup2
AND WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:07.288 region:rollup2
THE LONG TERM DATA ADDS THAT THE

01:47:06.053 --> 01:47:08.522 region:rollup2

STATUTES GOVERNING BOTH PROGRAMS

01:47:11.692 --> 01:47:14.595 region:rollup2
AND WE DO NOT HAVE THOSE

01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:16.196 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC OUTCOME MEASURES TO

01:47:14.595 --> 01:47:17.431 region:rollup2
POINT TO. AND THAT'S THE REASON

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:19.133 region:rollup2
WHY WE'RE STRUCTURING OUR

01:47:17.431 --> 01:47:20.701 region:rollup2

AND ALIGNING IT WITH THE

01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:07.794 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD.

01:51:06.059 --> 01:51:09.596 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF JUST

01:51:07.794 --> 01:51:10.597 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS OF FUNDING.

01:51:09.596 --> 01:51:12.966 region:rollup2
I'M IN FAVOR OF PERMANENT

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:15.502 region:rollup2

01:51:12.966 --> 01:51:17.671 region:rollup2
MY FIRST POINT TODAY IS IF ELSIE

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:20.307 region:rollup2

01:51:20.307 --> 01:51:22.776 region:rollup2
THEN SEE TO YOU SHOULD BE

01:51:21.341 --> 01:51:24.511 region:rollup2

WE HAD.

01:51:27.381 --> 01:51:32.619 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT.

01:51:30.884 --> 01:51:34.154 region:rollup2
WHEN STUDENTS TAKE A MATH CLASS

01:51:32.619 --> 01:51:35.422 region:rollup2
IN HIGH SCHOOL THERE ARE FOUR

01:51:34.154 --> 01:51:37.724 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATH CLASSES

01:51:35.422 --> 01:51:40.994 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALL KNOW ABOUT.

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:43.430 region:rollup2
ALGEBRA GEOMETRY CALCULUS.

01:51:40.994 --> 01:51:44.932 region:rollup2
TRIGONOMETRY.

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:47.367 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO DEBATE ALL OF THE

01:51:44.932 --> 01:51:49.903 region:rollup2
CLASSES ARE FUNDED.

01:51:47.367 --> 01:51:52.039 region:rollup2
ONE STUDENTS TAKE A CTU CLASS

01:51:49.903 --> 01:51:53.407 region:rollup2
THERE ARE FOUR TYPES OF CLASSES

01:51:52.039 --> 01:51:55.042 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CD CLASS ON A HIGH

01:51:53.407 --> 01:51:56.176 region:rollup2
SCHOOL CAMPUS.

01:51:55.042 --> 01:51:58.111 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SEA TO YOU CLASS

01:51:56.176 --> 01:52:01.481 region:rollup2
COUPLED WITH CORE ACADEMIC

01:51:58.111 --> 01:52:04.318 region:rollup2
CLASSES WHICH I HIGHLY.

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:06.954 region:rollup2
HIGHLY EMPHASIZE THEY ARE VERY.

01:52:04.318 --> 01:52:08.922 region:rollup2
VERY SUCCESSFUL.

01:52:06.954 --> 01:52:12.726 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO HOUR IN THREE HOUR

01:52:08.922 --> 01:52:15.128 region:rollup2
CLASSES ON CAMPUSES AND CENTERS

01:52:12.726 --> 01:52:16.396 region:rollup2
LIKE OURS IN SAN JOSE.

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:17.531 region:rollup2
CENTERS ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN

01:52:16.396 --> 01:52:19.766 region:rollup2
THERE ALWAYS FORGOTTEN AND LEFT

01:52:17.531 --> 01:52:20.734 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:52:19.766 --> 01:52:22.636 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE ARE THE LINK

01:52:20.734 --> 01:52:23.670 region:rollup2
LEARNING CLASSES.

01:52:22.636 --> 01:52:25.939 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT THOSE ARE

01:52:23.670 --> 01:52:27.774 region:rollup2
VALUABLE AS WELL.

01:52:25.939 --> 01:52:29.443 region:rollup2

02:07:03.483 --> 02:07:07.487 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:09.222 region:rollup2
CT IS AS RELEVANT TODAY AS

02:07:07.487 --> 02:07:10.923 region:rollup2
PROBABLY IT'S EVER BEEN.

02:07:09.222 --> 02:07:11.424 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE CHANGING NATURE

02:07:10.923 --> 02:07:12.758 region:rollup2
OF OUR WORK FORCE IN OUR

02:07:11.424 --> 02:07:14.560 region:rollup2

EITHER OR BETWEEN CAREER IN

02:07:16.963 --> 02:07:20.666 region:rollup2
THE EXACT SAME THING.

02:07:18.698 --> 02:07:22.468 region:rollup2
OF AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MATH

02:07:20.666 --> 02:07:24.470 region:rollup2
SCIENCE AND READING. THOSE THAT

02:07:26.072 --> 02:07:28.708 region:rollup2
ARE GRADUALLY MY HIGH SCHOOL THE

02:07:27.306 --> 02:07:30.209 region:rollup2
WAY THAT THEY'RE LEARNING THEIR

02:07:28.708 --> 02:07:31.377 region:rollup2

02:07:30.209 --> 02:07:33.146 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MORE PREPARED AND THE

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:35.114 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE THAN THOSE ARE. THAT

ARE FOCUS ONLY ON TRYING INTO

02:07:35.114 --> 02:07:38.551 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

02:07:36.249 --> 02:07:40.486 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW HOW VALUABLE THAT IS

02:07:38.551 --> 02:07:42.321 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS WAS INDICATED. IT IS

02:07:40.486 --> 02:07:43.489 region:rollup2
SAN JOSE SOUNDS A MEASURE OF HIS

02:07:42.321 --> 02:07:44.824 region:rollup2
MOST EXPENSIVE PLACE IN THE

02:07:43.489 --> 02:07:46.792 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

02:07:44.824 --> 02:07:48.094 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO RATS WHEN IT

02:07:46.792 --> 02:07:49.829 region:rollup2
COMES TO REAL ESTATE.

02:07:48.094 --> 02:07:51.697 region:rollup2
AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLY

02:07:49.829 --> 02:07:52.231 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE WORK WORLD WORK

02:07:51.697 --> 02:07:54.767 region:rollup2
MARKER ECONOMIC I'M A JOB

02:07:52.231 --> 02:07:58.671 region:rollup2
MARKET.

02:07:54.767 --> 02:08:01.140 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S I THINK.

02:07:58.671 --> 02:08:02.708 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY NOT REALISTIC IN NOR

02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:04.443 region:rollup2
IS IT COMPASSIONATE OR SMART FOR

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:06.779 region:rollup2
US.

02:08:04.443 --> 02:08:08.781 region:rollup2
CCTV IS IN SOME WAY COMPETING

02:08:06.779 --> 02:08:10.016 region:rollup2
WITH ANY KIND OF EDUCATIONAL

02:08:08.781 --> 02:08:12.985 region:rollup2
PROGRAM A PRANK POST COLLEGE

02:08:10.016 --> 02:08:15.087 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT.

02:08:12.985 --> 02:08:16.189 region:rollup2
PEOPLE NEED TO GO TO WORK.

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:18.124 region:rollup2
PAIN TO BUILD A FOUR TO LIVE IN

02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:18.824 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:08:18.124 --> 02:08:20.226 region:rollup2
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

02:08:18.824 --> 02:08:21.761 region:rollup2
COLLEGE IS NOT IN THEIR FUTURE

02:08:20.226 --> 02:08:23.329 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES IT

02:08:21.761 --> 02:08:24.330 region:rollup2
WON'T BE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING

02:08:23.329 --> 02:08:26.132 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A GREAT JOB STRAIGHT OUT

02:08:24.330 --> 02:08:27.233 region:rollup2
OF. HIGH SCHOOL THAT WILL BECOME

02:08:26.132 --> 02:08:29.268 region:rollup2
THEIR CAREER

02:08:27.233 --> 02:08:31.470 region:rollup2
BUT THEY HAVE AND AND AND I

02:08:29.268 --> 02:08:33.439 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE OF. DECEMBER QUIRK

02:08:31.470 --> 02:08:34.941 region:rollup2
SILVA SINGS CHOICES BECAUSE

02:08:33.439 --> 02:08:35.641 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT WE WANT

02:08:34.941 --> 02:08:38.010 region:rollup2
TO GIVE ALL OF US USE THE

02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:40.246 region:rollup2
CHOICES. THAT ATTRACT THEM

02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:42.181 region:rollup2
AND WE HEARD IT FROM A GRANT

02:08:40.246 --> 02:08:43.783 region:rollup2

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:45.084 region:rollup2
HIS PASSION.

02:08:43.783 --> 02:08:47.220 region:rollup2
AND FOR SOMEONE ELSE MAYBE IT

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:49.222 region:rollup2
WILL BE SOMETHING DOZEN AG FROM

02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:50.990 region:rollup2
COLLEGE TRACK THAT'S. FINE

02:08:49.222 --> 02:08:52.658 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO STOP

02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:54.660 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT.

02:08:52.658 --> 02:08:57.363 region:rollup2
CT AS A SUBSTITUTE BUT TO BASIC

02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:58.364 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. OTHER REALITY IS THAT

02:08:57.363 --> 02:08:59.999 region:rollup2
SEEKS YOU SHOULD NEVER BE

02:08:58.364 --> 02:09:02.635 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED A SUBSIDIARY. TYPE OF

EDUCATION IT YOU'RE REALLY A

02:09:02.635 --> 02:09:06.339 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS AN

02:09:04.236 --> 02:09:06.606 region:rollup2
EQUAL OTHER TO TO GOING TO

02:09:06.339 --> 02:09:08.874 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

02:09:06.606 --> 02:09:10.676 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AND MAY END UP ON THAT

02:43:19.356 --> 02:43:22.059 region:rollup2
IT SADDENS ME AND MY PEERS THAT

02:43:21.158 --> 02:43:23.394 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT CULTURE AND OUR

THIS ISN'T EMBLEMATIC OF A

DANGEROUS CLASS CASTE SYSTEM

02:43:34.672 --> 02:43:37.841 region:rollup2

02:43:35.839 --> 02:43:39.476 region:rollup2
NOTIONS THAT PEOPLE WHO PURSUE

02:43:44.615 --> 02:43:46.150 region:rollup2
THEN THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO WORK

02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:49.520 region:rollup2

TRADITIONAL TECH COMPANIES LIKE

APPLE GOOGLE AS WELL AS START

02:48:06.843 --> 02:48:10.414 region:rollup2

SECOND CATEGORY OF JOBS AND

02:48:10.414 --> 02:48:14.551 region:rollup2
THESE ARE TECHNOLOGY OCCUPATIONS

02:48:13.216 --> 02:48:17.087 region:rollup2

02:48:19.389 --> 02:48:22.459 region:rollup2
MODEST MIDDLE SKILL JOBS THAT

FALL SQUARELY IN THE IN IN IN

02:48:35.973 --> 02:48:41.411 region:rollup2
THE CATEGORY OF QUALITY CAREER

TECHNICAL ED JOBS.

02:48:41.411 --> 02:48:45.015 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE JOB

02:48:43.380 --> 02:48:47.084 region:rollup2
MARKETS BECOMING INCREASINGLY.

02:48:45.015 --> 02:48:49.052 region:rollup2
AUTOMATED AND THERE'S A LOT OF

02:48:47.084 --> 02:48:50.821 region:rollup2
FEAR ABOUT THIS BUT WE KNOW THAT

02:48:49.052 --> 02:48:53.023 region:rollup2
THESE JOBS A SIX GREATER TODAY

02:48:50.821 --> 02:48:55.158 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE BY THE TIME THEY HIT

02:48:53.023 --> 02:48:56.593 region:rollup2
THEIR THEIR PEAK JOB YEARS IN

02:48:55.158 --> 02:48:58.829 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTY.

02:48:56.593 --> 02:49:00.630 region:rollup2
ABOUT HALF OF TODAY'S JAWS WILL

02:48:58.829 --> 02:49:02.265 region:rollup2
BE REPLACED WITH OTHER JOBS.

02:49:00.630 --> 02:49:04.901 region:rollup2
LOT OF TIMES THESE JOBS ARE

02:49:02.265 --> 02:49:06.470 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO AS NEW COLLAR JOBS.

02:49:04.901 --> 02:49:07.838 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN'T PREDICT WHAT THOSE

02:49:06.470 --> 02:49:09.539 region:rollup2
JOBS ARE GOING TO BE IN THE

02:49:07.838 --> 02:49:11.074 region:rollup2
FUTURE BUT WE KNOW THAT THE

02:49:09.539 --> 02:49:12.609 region:rollup2
KINDS OF SKILLS THAT STUDENTS

02:49:11.074 --> 02:49:15.312 region:rollup2
ARE GIVEN NEED TO SUCCEED IN

02:49:12.609 --> 02:49:16.580 region:rollup2
THESE EMERGING NEW JOBS THAT WE

02:49:15.312 --> 02:49:17.814 region:rollup2
DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT TODAY.

02:49:16.580 --> 02:49:19.950 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR SKILLS SUCH AS

02:49:17.814 --> 02:49:22.019 region:rollup2
COMPUTATIONAL THINKING WORKING

02:49:19.950 --> 02:49:24.121 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVELY PROBLEM SOLVING

02:49:22.019 --> 02:49:25.789 region:rollup2

02:49:25.789 --> 02:49:28.725 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE FOCUSED A LOT ON THE

02:49:27.357 --> 02:49:30.227 region:rollup2
DIGITAL LITERACY SKILLS SO WE

02:49:28.725 --> 02:49:31.795 region:rollup2
BELIEVE ALL STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE

02:49:30.227 --> 02:49:34.031 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CODING.

02:49:31.795 --> 02:49:36.433 region:rollup2
AND WE CONSIDER COATING THE NEW

02:49:34.031 --> 02:49:36.967 region:rollup2
BASIC SKILLS ARE BASIC LITERACY

02:49:36.433 --> 02:49:38.368 region:rollup2
SKILL FOR THE TWENTY FIRST

02:49:36.967 --> 02:49:40.303 region:rollup2
CENTURY.

02:49:38.368 --> 02:49:41.938 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL

02:49:40.303 --> 02:49:44.307 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BE EXPOSED A COATING AT

02:49:41.938 --> 02:49:46.777 region:rollup2
AN EARLY AGE INCLUDING C.

02:49:44.307 --> 02:49:47.778 region:rollup2
STUDENTS. THIS MIGHT TURN ON THE

02:49:46.777 --> 02:49:49.379 region:rollup2
LIGHT BULB AND HELP THEM

02:49:47.778 --> 02:49:51.548 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE TWO

02:49:49.379 --> 02:49:54.017 region:rollup2
CAN GO INTO A HIGH DEMAND STEM

02:49:51.548 --> 02:49:56.586 region:rollup2
FIELD WHICH WERE SORELY LACKING

02:49:54.017 --> 02:49:58.021 region:rollup2
IN. GIRLS AND STUDENTS FROM

02:49:56.586 --> 02:49:59.723 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS.

02:49:58.021 --> 02:50:02.159 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN IF THE STUDENT IS NOT A

02:49:59.723 --> 02:50:04.995 region:rollup2
STEM ORIENTED STUDENT THE STONY

02:50:02.159 --> 02:50:06.296 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT EXPOSURE BECAUSE.

02:50:04.995 --> 02:50:08.732 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS EMBEDDED IN

02:50:06.296 --> 02:50:10.467 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY ALL BUSINESSES NOW AND

02:50:08.732 --> 02:50:12.235 region:rollup2
THEY'LL BE PART OF CREATING

02:50:10.467 --> 02:50:14.004 region:rollup2
THESE NEW SYSTEMS AND THEY HAVE

02:50:12.235 --> 02:50:15.706 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THAT BASIC EXPOSURE TO

02:50:14.004 --> 02:50:17.574 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND. THE TWENTY FIRST

02:50:15.706 --> 02:50:19.342 region:rollup2
CENTURY BUSINESS.

02:50:17.574 --> 02:50:20.711 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY ABOUT CODING WE

02:50:19.342 --> 02:50:22.779 region:rollup2
REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

02:50:20.711 --> 02:50:24.614 region:rollup2
ARMOR STUDENTS WITH THE SKILLS

02:50:22.779 --> 02:50:26.216 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWED THEM TO CREATE

02:50:24.614 --> 02:50:27.851 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AND NOT JUST CONSUME

02:50:26.216 --> 02:50:29.886 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY.

02:50:27.851 --> 02:50:31.154 region:rollup2
SO LASTLY.

02:50:29.886 --> 02:50:32.889 region:rollup2
AS EVERYONE HAS SAID TODAY WE

02:50:31.154 --> 02:50:34.991 region:rollup2
NEED WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED A

02:50:32.889 --> 02:50:37.294 region:rollup2

TSUNAMI THAT WE ALL HEAR ABOUT

02:57:30.540 --> 02:57:33.710 region:rollup2
WILL SOON OVERTAKE MANUFACTURING

02:57:32.442 --> 02:57:35.512 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE GENERATION THAT'S

02:57:33.710 --> 02:57:37.814 region:rollup2

02:57:45.655 --> 02:57:49.192 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS LOSE

THEIR COMPETITIVE EDGE.

02:57:49.192 --> 02:57:52.495 region:rollup2
AND WITHOUT A PROPERLY TRAINED

02:57:52.495 --> 02:57:56.599 region:rollup2

INNOVATE.

02:58:06.543 --> 02:58:09.646 region:rollup2
WE CAN EVEN PROVIDE BETTER

02:58:07.844 --> 02:58:11.247 region:rollup2

THE INTERNET OF THINGS.

02:58:12.949 --> 02:58:16.586 region:rollup2
