PARTNER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA'S DEBATE COMMISSION AND WE WELCOME THIS NEW INVESTMENT IN THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM IS TO MAKE COMMISSION IS BEEN GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO INITIATE THIS NEW FORM OF SUPPORT FOR ASPIRING EDUCATORS AND THEY CONTRIBUTE TOWARD EXPANDING OUR TEACHER WORKFORCE PIPELINE AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS FOLLOWING THE REDIRECTION OF STATE FUNDING INITIALLY ALLOCATED TOWARDS PROGRAM -- AND THE TWENTY TWENTY ALLOCATION OF FEDERAL INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT FUNDING THIS TO MADE COMMISSION MOVE TO SHIFT OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ALSO NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION HAS RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY APPLICATIONS FROM STUDENTS INDICATING SPECIAL A CREDENTIAL IN SPECIAL EDUCATION THIS DO NEED COMMISSIONS VERIFIED AND VALIDATED APPLICANTS SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIALS WITH THEIR INSTITUTIONS AND OBTAINS TEACHING AGREEMENTS FROM ELIGIBLE STUDENTS HOWEVER THE COMMISSION HAS NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO DISPERSE AWARDS TO ELIGIBLE STUDENT APPLICANTS ADDS I'M WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO FINALIZE THEIR APPROVAL ON AN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT THAT WAS NECESSARY DUE TO THE USE OF ID EA FUNDING FOR THESE AWARDS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS JUST FINALIZED AND SENT THAT AGREEMENT TO THE STEAMING FROM CHANNEL LAST WEEK WE ANTICIPATE ITS FINAL SIGNING AND EXECUTION HOPE TODAY -- THIS DO NEED COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE APPLICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR BUT ESTIMATES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT WE WOULD EXTINGUISH THE ENTIRE FIFTEEN BILLION IN THIS YEAR AND REMAINING FUNDS WOULD BE UTILIZED TOWARDS ADDITIONAL AWARDS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ACADEMIC YEAR THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT WE ANTICIPATE AWARDING TOWARDS APPLICANTS THIS YEAR WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT THAT ASIDE FOR THIS TO MAKE COMMISSIONS ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM AND RELATED OUTREACH EFFORT THERE WOULD BE A REMAINING BALANCE OF AT LEAST A SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS SIMILAR TO OTHER -- TEACHING GRANT PROGRAMS RECIPIENTS OF THE GOLDEN STATE YOUR GRANT AWARDS WILL NEED TO PROVIDE VERIFICATION OF EVERY YEAR TAUGHT AT A TARGETED SCHOOL SITE AND RECIPIENTS MUST TEACH FOUR OUT OF FIVE YEARS -- AFTER COMPLETING THE PROGRAM AND THE STUDENT COMMITMENT WILL BE FOLLOWING UP TO RECEIVE THE FULL FOUR YEARS A VERIFICATION UNDER DEVELOPMENT AS WE'VE NOT YET SEEN THE FIRST -- COURT AND TEACHERS ENTER OTHER SCHOOL SITES SO -- WITH THAT ALL STOP THEIR -- IT ON THE THIRTY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU MR BREMNER -- DOCTOR MERRY VECSEY SANDY COMMISSION ON TEACHING CREDENTIALING GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO BEGIN JUST BY PROVIDING A LITTLE CONTEXT AROUND THAT OF A ROMAN TRANSCRIPTIONAL AND CREDENTIALS SUPPLIED THE MAN -- ENROLLMENT IN TEACHER EDUCATION EXPERIENCED A FOUR PERCENT DROP IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOLLOWING SEVERAL YEARS OF GROWTH DURING THAT SAME YEAR THE NUMBERS OF TEACHING CREDENTIALS ISSUED INCREASED BY THREE PERCENT HOWEVER DUE TO CHRONIC AND ONGOING SHORTAGES THE COMMISSION ISSUED FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO MORE INTERN CREDENTIALS EMERGENCY PERMITS AND WAIVERS THAT FULL TEACHING CREDENTIALS THIS IMBALANCE IS EVEN WORSE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION WE'RE ALMOST TWO THOUSAND MORE INTERNAL CREDENTIALS EMERGENCY PERMITS AND WAIVERS WERE ISSUED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THAN FULL SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIALS THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT STATE INVESTMENTS IN TEACHER RECRUITMENT ARE DRAWING MORE TEACHERS INTO PREPARATION AND TEACHING AND INCREASING DIVERSITY IN THE TEACHING WORKFORCE OTHER GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE HEAR FROM THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMUNITY THAT CANDIDATE APPLICATIONS FOR ENROLLMENT IN TEACHER EDUCATION WENT UP THIS YEAR AND ARE ALSO UP FOR NEXT YEAR WE BELIEVE THIS SEARCH MAY BE DUE IN PART TO FLEXIBILITY AROUND IT MISSION SIX EXAMINATIONS RACIAL PROGRAM CAPACITY HOWEVER MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ADMIT THE NUMBERS OF CANDIDATES APPLYING FOR ENROLLMENT SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF AREAS -- IN WHICH DEMAND THAT TO BE GROWING I DISTRICTS ARE REPORTING ANNUALLY ABOUT THE NEED FOR TWENTY THOUSAND MORE NEW TEACHERS AROUND THIRTY PERCENT OF THOSE ARE IN MULTIPLE SUBJECT AREAS TWENTY PERCENT IN SPECIAL EDUCATION SIXTEEN PERCENT IN THE STEM FIELDS JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED MILLION HAS BEEN INVESTED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF THESE FUNDS ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE TEN MILLION FOR UNDERGRADUATE PATHWAYS TWENTY FIFTY MILLION FOR LOCAL SOLUTIONS GRANTS FORTY FIVE MILLION FOR A CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TEACHER CREDENTIALING PROGRAM FIFTEEN MILLION FOR THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM AND FIFTY ONE MILLION FOR THE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM -- ITSELF THIRTY SEVEN GRANTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO DATE TO LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES PARTNERING WITH TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS AT AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY RESIDENTS OF WORLD LAST YEAR JUST UNDER HALF OF THEM IN SPECIAL EDUCATION A THIRD IN STEM FIELDS AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT SEEKING BILINGUAL CERTIFICATION SEVENTY PERCENT COMPLETED THEIR PROGRAMS LAST YEAR ARRESTER AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PROGRAMS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SEVENTY PERCENT OF THEM THEY'VE IDENTIFIED AS PEOPLE OF COLOR OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE ALLOWING US TO ADDRESS SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM NEEDS FUNDING TO DATE AND PROPOSED FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OF FISCAL YEAR WILL PROVIDE FOR ALMOST FIFTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS TO EARN FULL TEACHING CREDENTIALS AND HELP US TO ADDRESS THE TEACHER SHORTAGE UNDERGRADUATE AND RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ARE GROWING CRITICAL STATE INFRASTRUCTURE BY ESTABLISHING STABLE PATHWAYS INTO TEACHING RESIDENCY PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR ARE HELPING TO DEVELOP LDA CAPACITY TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN TEACHERS AND THESE PROGRAMS HAVE VERY STRONG POTENTIAL TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF OUR TEACHING WORKFORCE I THINK I'LL CLOSE THERE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE ADMINISTERING WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER THOSE AND WE ENTHUSING ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THANK YOU FOR THAT IN THROUGH THE ASPIC SUPPORT -- WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THE QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF ALL THE PRESENTATIONS THANK YOU DOCTOR SANDY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THANK YOU ALEXANDER AND YOU HAVE THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION MANY OF THE TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PROGRAMS ARE ADMINISTERED THREE CTC BUT THE CITY IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN OUR TEACHERS AND OUR EDUCATION WORKFORCE TEACHERS ARE OUR GREATEST ASSET IN CLOSING THE OPPORTUNITY GAP AND WE NEED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST TEACHERS SPECIFICALLY WE NEED TO MAKE INROADS FOR MALE TEACHERS OF COLOR AND TEACHERS IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE MATH AND SPECIAL EDUCATION JUST TWO QUICK ITEMS TO HIGHLIGHT TO SHOW THE MEANINGFUL IMPACT THESE PROGRAMS ONE IS THAT EARLY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED THE PROPORTION OF TEACHER CANDIDATES OF COLOR WHEN COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS IT ALSO SHOWS THAT TEACHERS PREPARED IN A RESIDENCY PROGRAM STATE OR ARE RETAINED AT THEIR SCHOOLS AND IN THE TEACHING PROFESSION AT HIGHER RATES PARTICULARLY IN SCHOOLS WITH HISTORICALLY HIGH TEACHER TURNOVER RATES IN ADDITION THE CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE PROGRAM HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL AS A AS A PATHWAY INTO THE TEACHING PROFESSION ESPECIALLY FOR EDUCATORS OF COLOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE ROLES THESE PROGRAMS PLAYING AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU MS GARDNER -- ANY LEAD LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE GOOD MORNING MEMBERS A NEARLY WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE WANTED TO SHARE OUR ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE GOVERNOR'S TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PROPOSALS STARTING WITH THE TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANTS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO PROVIDE ONE HUNDRED MILLION POP NINETY EIGHT FOR ADDITIONAL GRANTS TO ESTABLISH NEW AND EXPAND EXISTING TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS JUST AS A QUICK REMINDER TEACHER RESIDENCIES BORROWED FROM THE MEDICAL RESIDENCY MODEL WE'RE TEACHER CANDIDATES TEACH ALONGSIDE A MENTOR TEACHER FOR AT LEAST ONE HALF THE TIME WHILE PURSUING COURSEWORK THE LEGISLATURE FIRST ESTABLISH A TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANT PROGRAM AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET INTERSEGMENT WE FOUND THAT TEACHER RESIDENCY MODEL MAY IMPROVE TEACHER PREPARATION BUT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO INITIATE AND SUSTAIN FOR INSTANCE THE DISTRICTS WE SPOKE TO MENTION ISSUES ESTABLISHING A RELIABLE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDING THE COURSE WORK ATTRACTING RESIDENTS TO THE PROGRAMS IN FINDING SUSTAINABLE FUNDING AFTER THEIR GRANDPARENTS ADDITIONALLY CDC WAS ONLY ABLE TO AWARD TWENTY SEVEN MILLION OUT OF THE FIFTEEN MILLION ALLOCATED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION IN THE INITIAL FUNDING ROUND THEIR MEANING TO FUNDS WERE SWEPT AS PART OF THE STATE'S COPING NINETEEN RESPONSE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET DUE TO THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED AND REDUCED AMOUNT OF FIFTEEN MILLION FOR THE TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANT THIS AMOUNT REFLECTS THE AMOUNT THAT CDC HAS BEEN ABLE TO AWARD TO DATE AND THE LIKELY CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT DAMPEN INTEREST MOVING ONTO THE CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TEACHING CREDENTIAL PROGRAM THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO PROVIDE TWENTY FIVE MILLION PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR ADDITIONAL GRANTS TO SUPPORT CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES TO PURSUE THEIR TEACHING CREDENTIAL CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES INCLUDE TEACHERS AIDES BUS DRIVERS CAFETERIA WORKERS OFFICE WORKERS ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS WOULD RECEIVE UP TO TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS UNDER THE POLLS ALL WE FIND OF A CLASSIFIED PROGRAM IS IN HIGH DEMAND AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY SEVEN APPLICATIONS FROM DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WERE UNFUNDED FROM THE FIRST TWO FUNDING ROUNDS SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS IN SUPPORT OF OF THE PROGRAM AND CONSIDER IT A LONG TERM GROW YOUR OWN WHICH RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STRATEGY HOWEVER IT A CLASSIFIED PROGRAM DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE TARGETED TO SCHOOLS MOST AFFECTED BY TEACHER SHORTAGES IN OUR ANALYSIS WE FOUND THAT OF THE TWENTY THREE DISTRICTS THAT APPLIED INDIVIDUALLY SEVEN HAD LOWER SHARES OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ON EMERGENCY CREDENTIALS COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PROPOSED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION TO THE CLASSIFIED PROGRAMS THAT ALSO INCLUDE CHANGES THAT WOULD PRIORITIZE AND TARGET DISTRICTS MOST AFFECTED BY TEACHER SHORTAGES THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE STATE FUNDS -- MOST OTHER TEACHER WORKFORCE INITIATIVES LAST WEEK MOVING ON TO THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANTS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO PROVIDE ONE HUNDRED MILLION NOT A PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR ADDITIONAL GRANTS AT THIS TIME AND THE FIRST ROUND OF GOLDEN C. TEACHER GRANTS HAS NOT YET BEEN AWARDED WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF THIS PROGRAM ON TEACHER SUPPLY FOR THIS REASON WE CONSIDER AN ADDITIONAL ROUND OF FUNDING TO THE PROGRAM TO BE SOMEWHAT PREMATURE FURTHERMORE THE IMPACT OF THIS PROGRAM AND ADDRESSING THE RECRUITMENT CHALLENGES THAT LOW INCOME SCHOOLS MAY EXPERIENCE MAYBE WHEN IT FIRST THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A TEACHER CANDIDATE WILL ULTIMATELY TEACH AT A LOW INCOME SCHOOL OR BE ABLE TO KEEP BACKGROUND FUNDING IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND SOME OF THESE FACTORS MAY SIMPLY BE OUT OF THE TEACHERS CONTROL THE VICTIM IS OF THIS FUNDING AS A RECRUITMENT INCENTIVE IS ALSO LIMITED SINCE SOME TEACHERS WOULD HAVE TAUGHT AT A LOW INCOME SCHOOL EVEN WITHOUT THE GRANT FUNDING LAST WEEK SCHOOLS TARGETED UNDER THIS PROPOSAL HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FROM THE THREE FEDERAL KOPET NINETEEN RELIEF PACKAGES TOTALING TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY OVER THESE FINE SCHOOLS HAVE A BROAD RANGE OF OPTIONS TO HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PREPARE TEACHERS INCLUDING PROVIDING TEACHERS SERVICE AWARD SIGNING BONUSES OR STUDENT DEBT PAYMENTS MUSIC PURCHASED ME BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO LOCAL NEEDS THAN DOUBLE THE STATE'S FUTURE GRANTS PARTY'S REASONS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GULF GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROPOSAL SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE BE INTERESTED IN INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR STUDENTS FOR TEACHERS WE SUGGEST FOCUSING EFFORTS ON EXPANDING THE TOTAL SUPPLY OF TEACHERS IN SHORTAGE AREAS FOR INSTANCE THE LEGISLATURE COULD INSTEAD TARGET FUNDING TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT IN INTEGRATED TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL THIS ALLOWS EIGHTY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO PURSUE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL ON SITE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN FOUR YEARS MANY OTHER STATES CURRENTLY OFFER THIS ROUTE INTO TEACHING UNDER THIS APPROACH THE STATE COULD INCREASE THE TOTAL SUPPLY OF TEACHERS BY ENCOURAGING MORE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TO PURSUE TEACHING AND A HIGH NEED SUBJECT AREA WHEN THEY MIGHT HAVE OTHERWISE RECEIVED ANOTHER PROFESSION WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU LESLIE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE RIGHT LET ME ASK A FEW QUESTIONS THEM FIRST ONE IS OR WHY THE CHANGE IN THE DEFINITION OF PRIORITY SCHOOLS TO CONCENTRATION GRANT SCHOOLS OVER SCHOOLS WITH HIGH PERCENTAGES OF TEACHERS WITH EMERGENCY PERMITS IS THE ADMINISTRATION CONCERNED THAT THIS POLICY CHANGE COULD PUSH THE LEAST EXPERIENCED TEACHERS INTO STRUGGLING SCHOOLS FOR COMMITTEE MAJORITY LEADER THE BOMBING OF FINANCED THE CHANGING THE DEFINITION AND LANGUAGE THE VICE A PRIORITY SCHOOL A ONCE THAT HAS AT LEAST ONE OF THE REPRESENTED TO CHECK OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD TO BETTER CAPTURE THE INTENT FOR THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO CHANGE THE DEFINITION TO BE TIED TO SCHOOLS WITH AT LEAST FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF HIGH NEED STUDENTS AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND DEFINITIONS ARE MOVING TO DECIDE CHANGE -- -- TO A FIFTY FIVE PERCENT FESTIVAL WILL ESTIMATE THE GOAL OF INCREASING THE STATEWIDE SUPPLY ON YOUR SECOND QUESTION -- THE GROUND -- BACKGROUND PROGRAM HAS CURRICULUM AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS IF THE STUDENT DOESN'T COMPLY WITH THE CURRICULUM OR CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS THE CITY WILL HAVE TO PAY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL RECEIVED GRANTS AND ONLY UP TO A FULL REPLACEMENT FOR EACH YEAR THAT THE STUDENT FAILS TO MEET THE SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS THIS POLICY FOCUSES ON PROVIDING GRANTS INCENTIVES FOR PROFESSIONALS TO SERVE IN PRIORITY SCHOOLS WILL BE GRANTED OFFER STUDENTS A DISTURBANCE NEED TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION SUCCESSFULLY PASS THE STATE FARM HAS REQUIREMENTS AND ULTIMATELY APPLY IN THE HIGH BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS THANK YOU MISTRAS MISTER CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION YOU FOR FILLING AND LYFT ATTEMPT OUT REAL QUICK IN THIS INTERESTING JOB WE HAVE SOMETIMES -- YES IF YOU COULD -- JUST GO DOWN THE LIST AND HELP US UNDERSTAND -- BUT MORE ABOUT THE GOALS TAKE GRANTEES AND AND THE COMPLETION ISSUES AS WELL AS GET INTO THE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM AS WELL AND CHECK A RELIC CHÁVEZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THAT KARIM A REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROGRAM IS THAT THERE'S STUDENT MUST BE ENROLLED IN A TEACHING CREDENTIAL PROGRAM AB MUST HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPETED AT THE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING I WILL NEVER ROLLED INTO TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM THE STUDENT MUST MAINTAIN A GOOD ACADEMIC STANDING UP ON COMPLETION OF THE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM AT THE STUDENT WAS SATISFIED THE STATE BASIC SQL PROFICIENCY TEST REQUIREMENTS IN CURRENT LONG AND MUST COMPLETE THE REQUIRED TEACHING SERVICE FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE RECIPIENTS TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM OKAY THE NEXT ABOUT THE M.

F. P. I THINK THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S REPORT IS IS ACCURATE THAT THAT MAY NOT HAVE GONE TO THE HIGHEST NEED OR THE -- THE LOWEST INCOME I DISTRICTS IN THE STATE THAT CERTAINLY IS AN ADAPTATION TO THE PROGRAM THAT THAT WE COULD CREATE AS WELL AS ONE OF THE PRIORITIES OF I THINK EXPANDING THESE FUNDS FULLY -- USE WOULD BE A GOAL ON ANNUALLY AND AND WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT IF IF PARAMETERS ARE INCLUDED OF LIKE THESE THAT HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED THAT THEY BE A LIST OF PRIORITIES SO THAT WE DON'T HIT -- A BLOCK WHERE WE CAN'T RELEASE ALL OF THE FUNDS BECAUSE THEY THEY CAN'T BE ABSORBED BY A SMALLER GROUP OF OF THE L.

L. IT WILL BE WHAT THE ALLEN NOW ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS WE HAVE SOME GENERAL ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER FIRST WE CONSIDER THE GOVERNOR'S BLOCK GRANT APPROACH TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO BE REASONABLE FUNDING COULD BE USED TO COMPENSATE STAFF TIME SPENT ON TRAINING OR OTHER ASSOCIATED COSTS THE BLOCK GRANT ALSO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY OVER THE TRAINING TOPICS ALONG COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT TO BE TARGETED TO AREAS THAT WOULD MOST BENEFIT TEACHERS AND OTHER STAFF AT EACH SCHOOL SECONDLY AND MOST OF THE TARGETED PROPOSALS ADDRESS SPECIFIC GAPS IN TRAINING FOR INSTANCE THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IS DUE TO ADOPT A NEW ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM BY THE END OF MARCH SINCE ITS GUIDANCE IS NEW STATE FUNDED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SEEMS REASONABLE OTHER PROPOSALS SEEM TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF EXIT EXISTING RESOURCES SUCH AS THE EARLY MATH INITIATIVE OR FURTHER PROMOTES LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES SUCH AS THE STATE'S CONTINUED EFFORTS ON THE MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING WHERE LESS CLEAR HOWEVER ON HOW THE FUNDING FOR THE SUBJECT MATTER PROJECTS WOULD ADDRESS EXISTING GAPS FOR INSTANCE A TWO MILLION PROVIDED FOR ITS SUBJECT MATTER PROJECTS FIRST ETHNIC STUDIES APPEARS DUPLICATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S OTHER PROPOSAL AN ETHNIC STUDIES THIRD THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CONTAINS VERY FEW DETAILS ON SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS FOR IT SINCE THE EARLY MATH INITIATIVE AND THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING PROPOSALS DO NOT SPECIFY THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES TO BE SUPPORTED WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING THE SUBJECT MATTER PROJECT PROPOSAL DOES NOT CLARIFY HOW THE ONE TIME AUGMENTATION WOULD BE USED DIFFERENTLY THAN ONGOING FUNDING CURRENTLY PROVIDED TO THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE SPENT AS INTENDED WITH THE DESIRED OUTCOME WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CLEAR DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTATIONS TIED TO FUNDING FOR THESE MORE TARGETED PROPOSALS LASTLY WE NOTED THAT FUNDS PROVIDED THROUGH THE THREE FEDERAL COPING NINETEEN RELIEF PACKAGES CAN ALSO BE USED FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THE LEGISLATURE ME JUST WANNA CONSIDER HOW THE GOVERNOR'S PULLS ME COMPLEMENT THESE FUNDS WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU WITH QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTRETTA YES AT THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WITH REGARD TO THE EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS BLOCK GRANTS I HOPE THAT I HOPE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LANGUAGE ACTUALLY STE IT'S GOING TO SAY BUT IT NEEDS TO BE PRETTY SPECIFIC I MEAN TO ME IT IT SCHOOL COUNSELORS AT SCHOOLS PROBABLY -- OTHERWISE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO BE AN EFFECTIVE USE OF MONEY IF WE DON'T REALLY BE SPECIFIC ON WHAT WHAT THE USE OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE FOR INTRODUCTION BECAUSE WE WE SHOULD PROBABLY GOING TO IS SOME KIDS ARE US DOWN WHEN WE SHOULD BE GIVING DISTRICTS MONEY TO DEVELOP BETTER ONLINE PROGRAMS I DON'T WANT KIDS ONLINE QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S AN EFFECTIVE WAY TEETH BUT SOME ARE GOING TO REMAIN SO AND THE CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATIONS FOR THE MOST PART ARE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB OF IT OF THOSE THAT ARE OUT THERE SO SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY THIS IS MY POINT I SEE THERE'S FOR THE EARLY -- EARLY MATH INITIATIVE EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS THE SHOULD BE A HUNDRED AND EIGHT POINT THREE THAT SHOULD BE A HUGE PRIORITY -- HELPING TEACHERS -- DELIVER MATH SKILLS IN A MORE EFFECTIVE MANNER TO STUDENTS EIGHT POINT THREE IS LIKE NOTHING OKAY THAT JUST SAYS HEY THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY -- WITH REGARD TO THE UC -- SUBJECT MATTER PROJECT ON LEARNING LOSS -- -- THEIR SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF OTHERS FIVE MILLION -- DEDICATED TO TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON LEARNING LOS I THINK WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF GIVING THE UC MONEY -- -- TO -- TO ENHANCE -- TEACHER CREDENTIALING CANDIDATES -- TEACHER SKILLS IN THE CLASSROOM AND HE'S GOT THE CSU THAT IS THE PLACE WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS THE PLACE WHERE TEACHER CREDENTIALED CANDIDATES COME FROM BY AND LARGE THE UC DOES NOT MUCH OF IT AND DOESN'T SEEM TO ME EVEN HAVE AN INTEREST IN DOING SO IT REALLY SHOULD GO TO THE CSU BECAUSE THAT IS REALLY THE WORK COURSE -- INITIAL HORSE -- WITH REGARD TO TO TO TO THE PRODUCTION OF EFFECTIVE TEACHERS MY MY PERCEPTION IS THE UC PRODUCES STUFF LIKE THIS IT'S IT'S ON THE SHELF AND NEVER GETS ON THE GROUND SO WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF GIVING MONEY THE UC IT SHOULD GO TO THE CSU BECAUSE THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE TYPICALLY IN THE CLASSROOM MORE TYPICALLY MORE CONNECTED TO THEIR COMMUNITIES IT'S JUST A FACT FROM MY FROM MY PERCEPTION -- -- SO WITH THAT OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS I I JUST WANNA DRESS TWO ISSUES ONE IS THE IT'S IT'S A SMALLER AMOUNT HERE IN THE LAST ITEM THE DRESSED IN OUR AGENDA THE ETHNIC STUDIES PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT I KNOW SOMEONE MEMBER MEDINA AND WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE BUT I BELIEVE IT'S CHIANG AT HIGHER ED SEX SPECIAL COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW ALONG WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER MEMBERS AND TO IMPLEMENT ETHNIC STUDIES AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALREADY DOING IT AND -- THERE IS OF COURSE THE ONE SOMEONE TIME MONEY HERE AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD I'D LIKE TO AND ARE ASSEMBLY VERSION OF THE BUDGET AND SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE SO BE PREPARED THAT THIS WILL BE A PRIORITY -- FOR THE FOR THE ASSEMBLY AND I JUST WANTED TO GO BACK AND ADDRESS WHAT -- EDUCATION CHERYL DONALD BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON THE EDUCATOR BLOCK GRANTS AND -- MORE TIGHTENING UP THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE COULD HEAR FROM FINANCE OR WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT DOING IN OUR VERSION OF THE BUDGET FOR THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT OUT OF MONEY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION -- ONE TIME WHO KNOWS MORE ONE TIME MONEY THEM THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSED TO PUT MARIN AND MAY I JUST WANT I REMEMBER THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT YOU'RE THAT THE BUT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE HAVE THIS PROPOSAL AS NOTED HERE IN THE AGENDA -- JUST WONDERED IF IF IF L. A. OUR FINANCER CD II -- HAS ANY INSIGHT ON ON HOW THAT WENT THOSE YEARS AND -- WHAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT DOING IN THE SECOND ROUND -- GOING OUT TO OUR DISTRICTS AND UPPING THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS CERTIFIED EDUCATORS AROUND CALIFORNIA THIS IS KIMBERLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I AM WE HAVE BEEN HEARING ANECDOTALLY THAT EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS OUT IN THE FIELD ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE AND EFFECTIVE EDUCATOR BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM IT WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN OF THE MONEY PROGRAM IS IS FACT AND AFTER THE TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN CHANGES OTHER THAN THE TOPIC AREAS THAT THE MONEY CAN BE SPENT ON TYPES OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OR PROFESSIONAL LEARNING WELL IT THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS FUNDING IS IT ALLOWS EACH LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY TO PROVIDE THE TYPE OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT THEIR EDUCATORS LOOKING FOR THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES THEY CAN USE THESE FUNDS TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR FUNDS THEY CAN USE OTHER FUNDS TO SUPPLEMENT THESE FUNDS I'M IT'S VERY FLEXIBLE AND WE FOUND THAT IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN PROGRAM BASED ON REPORTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT EDUCATORS ARE TEACHING ABOUT THEM SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACTUALLY APPLYING MORE FUNDING TO THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THEY PROVIDED THEM TO SUPPLEMENT THE EFFECTIVE EDUCATOR BOKER OUT SOME DO THINK THAT THIS IS A FANTASTIC WAY TO PROVIDE MONEY THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO THEIR EDUCATORS OKAY THE L.

HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON ON THIS APPROPRIATIONS COMPARED TO WHAT WE DID SEVEN YEARS AGO AND AND WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD -- TAKE A LOOK AT THE JUSTANSWER TIGHTENING THE LANGUAGE FOR DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA SURE ASSEMBLYMEMBER IMMEDIATELY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AGAIN IN OUR REVIEW OF THIS PROPOSAL WE FOUND THAT THAT APPROACH FOR BLOCK GRANTS TO YOU FOR PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT WAS A REASONABLE APPROACH FLEXIBILITY THAT'S GIVEN TO DISTRICTS OVER HOW TO USE THESE FUNDS AND WHAT TOPICS TO CHOOSE WITHIN A LIST THAT'S ALREADY IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ITSELF AND SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY INITIAL CONCERNS OR ANY ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF THIS PROPOSAL OKAY AND THEN LASTLY TO SOMEONE I WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT IS NOTED IN THE STAFF AGENDA AND WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF DONNA MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THAT HOW THIS HE WIN THIS THAT LEARNING LOSS ISSUES DURING THIS -- PANDEMIC AND HOW YOU KNOW THESE MONIES CAN HELP ADDRESS -- THE THE ISSUES THAT TEACHERS ARE GOING TO BE FACED WITH HOW TO YOU KNOW GET STUDENTS -- PACKET BACK AT -- AT PAR WITH THAT WHERE THEY SHOULD BE ON THEIR LEARNING HOW ABOUT SIX CD HERE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WITH THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION I I WOULD ACTUALLY PREFER TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND HOW THEY AND HOW THEY PERCEIVE THESE GRANTS TO BE UTILIZED AT FOR LEARNING LAWSUIT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S BEEN QUITE A BIT OF FUNDS ALLOCATED AS PART OF THE -- RE OPENING AND AS EARLY EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAM THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED RECENTLY THAT THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION FOR EXTENDED LEARNING AND THEN THE TWO BILLION FOR FOR THAT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT SEEKS AT CCP HAS BEEN FUNDED TO DO A LOT OF THAT KIND OF WORK TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON THE LEARNING LAST PIECE AS WELL THIS IS YOUR LIFE HE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- REGARDING IT EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS BLOCK GRANT DUE TO THE FLEXIBILITY OF THESE FUNDS WHAT -- THEN THE TOPIC AREAS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE HELICASE CAN SPEND THIS MONEY ON THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AREAS OTHER THAN -- LOST MAYBE LEARNING LOS LEARNING MITIGATION THEY THEY CAN SPEND THIS ON SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING THEY CAN SPEND THIS ON STUDENT ENGAGEMENT PRACTICES THEY CAN SPEND THIS ON -- HOW TO BETTER -- WORK WITH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS IT'S I MEAN THERE ARE SIX TOPIC AREAS WITHIN WHICH THE APARTMENT THAT THE L. E. A.

THIS LATER IN THE SPRING OF THE CASING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUE NUMBER TWO ISSUE NUMBER THREE THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING GOOD MORNING BEGAN ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AS INDICATED IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS THE COMMISSION IS CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT STANDARDS BOARD RESPONSIBLE FOR CREDENTIALING THE EDUCATION WORKFORCE ACCREDITING APPROVED SPONSORS OF EDUCATOR PREPARATION AND ENFORCING STANDARDS OF PRACTICE AND CONDUCT FOR CREDENTIALED EDUCATORS IN ADDITION THE COMMISSION ESTABLISHES AND MAINTAINS EXAMINATIONS AND PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS FOR EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTERS TEACHER RECRUITMENT GRANTS THE COMMISSION'S OPERATING BUDGET IS SUPPORTED BY CREDENTIAL AND EXAMINATION FEES HAVE I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD SHAPE ALL THINGS CONSIDERED OUR YEAR TO DATE REVENUES ARE DOWN BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO COVER GAPS THIS YEAR WHO ARE EXISTING RESERVES AS NECESSARY THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR WE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER CREDENTIAL AND SUBSTITUTE PERMIT APPLICATIONS THAN USUAL WE ATTRIBUTE THIS TO SCHOOL CLOSURES AND EXPECT THAT OUR SCHOOLS REOPEN THIS SPRING AND INTO THE FALL WE WILL BEGIN TO BOUNCE BACK THIS TIME LAST YEAR THE COMMISSION WAS PLANNING FOR A SIGNIFICANT INFUSION OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT TEACHER RESIDENCIES AND OTHER RECRUITMENT PROGRAMS TO WORK TOWARD ELIMINATING TEACHER SHORTAGES WE HAD RECEIVED FUNDING UNDER THE PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT RENEWAL TO LUNCH SIGNIFICANT DO WORK IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WE WERE WORKING WITH PREPARATION PROGRAMS TO FULLY IMPLEMENT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS AND ENGAGED IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FIELD ABOUT OUR CURRENT TEACHER EXAMINATIONS ON MARCH NINETEENTH WE HAD A HARD STOP SCHOOLS AND HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS CLOSED THEIR BUILDINGS AND MOVED QUICKLY TO IMPLEMENT ONLINE INSTRUCTION AND FINISH OUT THE SCHOOL YEAR AS BEST THEY COULD OUR EMPLOYEES TRANSITION TO TELEWORK AND LIKE EVERY OTHER ENTERPRISES WE WERE FACED WITH THE QUESTION WHAT DO WE DO NOW IMPACTS ON STUDENT TEACHERS COMPLETING CLINICAL PRACTICE AND ON THE CLOSURE OF TESTING CENTERS WHERE TWO OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL ISSUES WE FACED EARLY ON THE PIPELINE INTO TEACHING WAS ESSENTIALLY SHUT DOWN TEACHERS ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE STUDENT TEACHING AND PASSED THE RICA AND A PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT TO ACCEPT PREPARATION COULD NOT DO SO NEITHER COULD PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS WHO NEEDED TO TAKE BASIC SKILLS AND SUBJECT MATTER TESTS TO ENROLL IN TEACHER PREPARATION MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS IN EARLY JUNE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER POSTPONING THE DATES BY WHICH TEACHERS WOULD NEED TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS ALLOWING PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS TO ENTER PREPARATION AND COMPLETE BASIC SKILLS AND SUBJECT MATTER TESTS LATER AND ALLOWING STUDENT TEACHERS WHO WERE CLOSE TO FINISHING TO EARN THEIR CREDENTIALS BEGIN TEACHING IN THE FALL INCOMPLETE PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT CENTER RIGA DURING THEIR FIRST YEARS OF TEACHING LAST YEAR'S TRAILER BILL EXTENDED THESE ALLOWANCES FOR ANOTHER YEAR AGAIN PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT SUPPORT FOR THE PIPELINE INTO TEACHING IN ADDITION THE COMMISSION WORKED WITH PREPARATION PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD BE SUSPENDED MOVED OR ADJUSTED TODAY TO COULD NOT FINISH ALL REQUIREMENTS LAST SPRING ELIGIBLE TO BEGIN TEACHING IN THE FALL ON A WAIVER AND COMPLETE THOSE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN ONE YEAR WE ARE FORTUNATE IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A CREDENTIALING STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES A TWO YEAR REDUCTION PROGRAM FOR NEW TEACHERS RECEIVE SUPPORT AND MENTORING WHILE THEY ON BOARD IN THE PROFESSION THE STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING INTENSIVELY WITH THE PREPARATION AND INDUCTION COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION FOR TEACHERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE INTERRUPTIONS IN THEIR PREPARATION PATHWAYS AND WE'RE ENCOURAGED DEEPLY SO BY THE COMMITMENT OF EDUCATORS ACROSS THE CONTINUUM TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT NEEDED TO SUSTAIN NEW TEACHERS HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS TO EXPAND PATHWAYS TO DEMONSTRATE BASIC SKILLS AND SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCE ARE A WELCOME RELIEF TO THE BOTTLENECK FUSSED BY TESTING CENTER CLOSURES OR TESTING PROGRAMS FOR TEACHERS NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND UPDATED WITH AN EYE TOWARD THEIR CURRENT RELEVANCE IN BOTH CONTENT AND FUNCTION WITH THE ADVENT OF PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS IN RECENT YEARS AND PROPOSALS THAT MAKES STANDARDIZED TESTING ONE OF SEVERAL OPTIONS WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE AND RIGHT SIZE THEIR IMPACT ON THE INCOMING TEACHING WORKFORCE THE GOVERNOR'S FUNDING PROPOSALS TO UPDATE AND EXPAND PATHWAYS INTO TEACHER PREPARATION ARE BOTH NECESSARY AND TIMELY ALSO THE PROPOSALS TO EXPAND RESIDENCIA CLASSIFIED GRANT PROGRAMS AND GROW THE SIZE OF OUR TEACHING WORKFORCE IN SHORT WE FULLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU OKAY LESSONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE -- THE THE DATE TEEKAY CREDENTIALING -- DISCUSSIONS YOU KNOW WE'VE CERTAINLY ALREADY HAVE -- THOUSANDS OF TWO K. TEACHERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND -- ATTENTIVELY MORE WITH WITH IT WITH EXPANSION AND YOU WE HAVE THE TRADITIONAL -- TEACHER CREDENTIALING FOR K. TWELVE TEACHERS AND SO THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSIONS OF HAVING ONE THAT FOCUS ON OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS FOR TO CANCEL CAN YOU DISCUSS THAT YES ABSOLUTELY WE WERE -- WE WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY TO SEE IT BEING A MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE AND ITS BROAD VISION FOR -- KIND OF A TEN YEAR GOAL FOR RICIN FOR HOW WE KIND OF COULDN'T REORGANIZE THE WHOLE SET OF SERVICES AND SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE UNDER WAY IN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD SPACE SO WITH ALL THAT IN MIND THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING -- WE'VE HAD A DESIGN TEAM THAT WORKED WITH US FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS ON HOW SHOULD WE STRUCTURE PREPARATION FOR THE WORK FORCE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MASTER PLAN AND THAT THAT CHANCE TO GAUGE WHERE PUBLIC OPINION IS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD -- SET REQUIREMENTS FOR WORK IN EARLY -- THE PRESCHOOL NTK WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS THEY HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING OF THE POSSIBILITY OF REGULATIONS AROUND THE T. K. PORTION IN PARTICULAR AND REALLY WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO AND AND WE THESE CONVERSATIONS RELATING FOR THAT IS WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO MAKE THIS A MORE SEAMLESS PROCESS OF PREPARATION FOR TEACHERS WORKING IN THE PRESCHOOL SPACE THE T. K. SPACE IN THE EARLY EARLY GRADES -- SO WE HAVE SOME IDEAS ON THE TABLE WHERE WE TAKE THE MULTIPLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL AND -- EXPAND ITS END AND STRENGTHEN IT FOR ITS -- ITS ABILITY TO WORK WITH AN EARLY LEARNING AND CARE ENVIRONMENT AND TO TAKE THE EXISTING CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT AND STRENGTHEN IT SO THAT THERE IS A PATHWAY AND AND POSSIBLY EVEN A NICE BRIDGE TO MOVE FROM ONE TO THE OTHER ALTHOUGH THESE ARE BIG IDEAS IT AND IT'S IT'S A DEVELOPMENT SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ATK CREDENTIAL IT'S THAT EARLY IT'S EARLY GREAT SO LIKE A P. THREE THREE CREDENTIAL HOW THE DIFFERENT THE MULTIPLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL SO WE DON'T HAVE A P. A T. K. THROUGH GRADE THREE CREDENTIAL YET ON THE BOOKS NOT ONLY HAVE MEANT THAT THE IS THE IDEA TO CREATE SIX NOT NECESSARILY TEEKAY CREDENTIAL BUT I CREEK AND I'M KIND OF PARALLEL CREDENTIAL FOR P. THROUGH THIRD GRADE P. THREE THREE THAT IS ONE OF THE IDEAS ON THE TABLE WE REALLY NEED TO GAUGE THE -- THE THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION'S SUPPORT FOR THAT IDEA WE THINK GOOD A TKA THROUGH GRADE THREE CREDENTIAL COULD ADD A LOT TO OUR SYSTEM -- AND THE MULTIPLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL YOU KNOW ALREADY TO WORK IN TKA REQUIRES THAT THAT TEACHERS HAVE SOME PREPARATION IN EARLY -- CHILD CARE AND EDUCATION BUT AGAIN WE WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THAT WE ARE ALL WE ARE AT THE EDGE HERE OF BEING ABLE TO REALLY DIG IN AND AND LOOK AT WAYS TO STRENGTHEN THE OTHER AT A PRESCHOOL THROUGH GRADE THREE PRUDENTIAL COULD HELP WOULD REPLACE THE MULTIPLE SUBJECTS PROVINCIAL LIKELY NOT I IN TERMS OF WORKING T. K. THROUGH GRADE THREE BUT WHAT IT NEED TO ALIGN TO THAT AND AND ALLOW A STEP MULTIPLE WAYS TO ASSIGN TEACHERS TO THESE ENVIRONMENTS THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE ABLE OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BY ADONIS YES TO KIND OF DIG INTO THIS -- TOPIC A LITTLE FURTHER YOU KNOW THE EARLY LEARNING COMMUNITY PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS ON FOR DECADES NOW HAVE BEEN WORKING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF I'M NOT JUST CARE BUT TEACHERS AND THERE ARE TEACHERS MORE AND MORE TEACHERS AT A PRESCHOOL TEACHERS HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREES SOME ONLY HAVE A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF UNITS OR -- ED EARLY LEARNING THEIR CHILD CARE PERMITS -- SO I THINK THAT WE DO NEED TO CONSIDER A PIPELINE AND THIS PIPELINE A I DON'T I WOULDN'T WANT TO DECIMATED BECAUSE OF SEEING A STRINGENT RESTRICTIONS SO I'M DEFINITELY OPEN TO TALKING ABOUT WHAT A -- P. THREE THREE OR PRESCHOOL T. K. CREDENTIALING PROCESS COULD LOOK LIKE WELL KEEPING IN MIND THAT THERE IS AN EXISTING WORK FORCE -- THAT HAS WORKED HARD TO IMPROVE QUALITY SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT THERE AND WOULD LOVE YOU KNOW ANY ADDITIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FLEXIBILITIES WE COULD GIVE TO THE EXISTING WORK FORCE TO GET THEM TO A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD BE T. K. TEACHERS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER -- EIGHT N. AND BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT THE COST MAY MAYBE TO THAT WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WITH THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING -- AND YOU KNOW THIS IS WE WE'VE WE'RE GOOD BUT WE'RE RIGHT AT THE EDGE NOW WITH THE MASTER PLAN PROVIDING A BROAD CONTEXT AND REYES AND WE'RE I THINK WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND WORK TOGETHER -- TYPICALLY THIS IS A TECHNICAL QUALITY OF CREDENTIALING IN CALIFORNIA BUT ONCE SOMEBODY IS CREDENTIALED TO DO SOMETHING WE DON'T TAKE THAT CREDENTIAL AWAY SO ANY CHANGES WE MAKE GOING FORWARD IN PREPARATION OF LICENSURE FOR THIS COMMUNITY WILL NOT REMOVE THEIR THE ABILITY OF THE EXISTING WORKFORCE TO CONTINUE PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING BUT AS WE ARE DEVELOPING SYSTEMS THAT ARE INTERNET STANDARDS FOR PREPARATION AND WORKING WITH PREPARATION PROGRAMS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS TO STRENGTHEN AND BRING SOME CONSISTENCY AND AND SYSTEMATIC ORDER TO THE PREPARATION IS WORKFORCE WE THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES TO INVEST IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR THE EXISTING WORKFORCE AND TO CREATE ON RAMPS FOR THIS WORK FORCE TO MOVE INTO A DEEPER INTO OPPORTUNITIES IN THE PRE K. THROUGH GRADE THREE SPACE WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE CLASSIFIED GRANT PROGRAM POSSIBLY BEING ADAPTED FOR THIS PURPOSE OF BRITISH POPULATION WE THINK THAT'S A FIRST A GOOD IDEA -- AND SO IT'S BUT ALL OF THIS OF THE MOMENT IS REALLY IN THE CONCEPTUAL STAGE I WILL BE GETTING SOME WORK -- ON AS I SAID ON STANDARDS AND AND LOOKING AT HOW TO STRENGTHEN PREPARATION PROGRAMS WE'RE BUILDING A PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT FOR PRESCHOOL THROUGH T. K. TEACHERS ARE ADDED AND THAT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT WILL BECOME A TOOL THAT CAN BE USED TO STRENGTHEN PREPARATION AND DIAGNOSTICALLY TO ASSESS THE NEEDS OF THE EXISTING WORKFORCE SO WE CAN FOCUS INVESTMENTS AND AND REYES SAID THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE WHOLE OF THE WHOLE POPULATION SO A LOT OF IDEAS AND PROGRAMS -- UNDER WAY WE DON'T WANT TO DISENFRANCHISE THE EXISTING WORKFORCE AS WE DO THIS SO ATTENDING TO TRANSITIONS -- BETTER TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE AND WELL SUPPORTED WILL BE A CRITICAL PART OF WHAT WE DO NEXT AND ONE MORE QUESTION IF YOU WILL I'M JUST TO KIND OF BROADEN THEM THE THAT TOPIC HERE THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE MAKES NUMEROUS CHANGES TO ALLOW FLEXIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WORKING TOWARDS A TEACHING CREDENTIAL TO DEMONSTRATE BASIC SKILLS AND SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCY I'M CAN THE CTC COMMENT ON SOME OF THE POTENTIAL BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR TEACHER CANDIDATES THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS AND HOW WILL THESE CHANGES IMPACT THE CAREER PATHWAY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL INTERESTED IN BECOMING A CREDENTIALED TEACHER WELL WE APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE FIRST HAS TO DO WITH THE BASIC SKILLS REQUIREMENT EVERY TEACHER NEEDS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR BASIC SKILLS COMPETENCE MOST TEACHERS ARE TAKING THE CALIFORNIA BASIC EDUCATIONAL SKILLS TEST THE C. BEST -- AND WE FOUND OF SIGNIFICANT BERRIER THIS YEAR WHEN TESTING CENTERS WERE CLOSED AND PEOPLE COULD NOT GOING TO TAKE THOSE TESTS SO FOR YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN ALTERNATIVES TO THE TEST ITSELF TO BEAT THIS REQUIREMENT INCLUDING SCORES ON THE SAT OR THE ACT -- AND OTHER MEASURES THAT THE LEGISLATURES ADOPTED OVER THE YEARS THE PROPOSAL THIS YEAR IS TO ALLOW RATES OF THE B. OR BETTER AN UNDERGRADUATE UNDERGRADUATE COURSEWORK FOCUSED ON READING WRITING AND MATHEMATICS TO COUNT RIGHT SIZE IN SOME WAYS THIS REQUIREMENT WHERE TESTERS KEPT PEOPLE OUT OF -- OUT OF PREPARATION ALLOWING CONFIDENCE DEMONSTRATED IN YOUR UNDERGRADUATE COURSEWORK AT A GRADE OF B. OR BETTER OF ME IS THAT YOU'VE GOT BASIC ROLES THIS IS BECAUSE COMPETENCE AND YOU SHOULD BE MOVING FORWARD INTO TEACHER PREPARATION IF THAT'S YOUR GOAL OF PARALLEL TO THAT IS THE SUBJECT MATTER REQUIREMENT WE CURRENTLY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA SUBJECT EXAMINATIONS FOR TEACHERS THE C. SET OF WHICH MEASURES ACT OF POTENTIAL TEACHERS SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCE THE LAW CURRENTLY ALLOWS THEM TO COMPLETE A FULL PROGRAM OF PREPARATION IN THAT SUBJECT MATTER AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE TEST WITH THIS OF PROPOSAL WOULD DO IS ALLOW FOR THE MIXING AND MATCHING UP TESTS INCLUDES FORCE WORK SO IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T PASS A PARTICULAR SUB TEST THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT UP BY TAKING A COURSE IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW PREPARATION PROGRAMS TO EVALUATE TRANSCRIPTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER COURSE WORK HAS BEEN TAKEN THAT ADDRESSES THE MAJOR DOMAINS OF THE SUBJECT MATTER AREA TO BE TAUGHT SO THE POSTER CHILD FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MIGHT BE A MATHEMATICS MAJOR WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE A TEACHER OF MATHEMATICS THE QUESTION IS SHOULD THEY HAVE TO GO BACK AND TAKE A C. SET TEST OR COULD WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOMEONE WITH A MATH DEGREE HAS MET AND EXCEEDED THE STANDARD AND JUST LET THE MOVING TO TEACHING THIS HAVE BEEN MONOLITHIC ROADBLOCKS FOR PEOPLE -- THAT THAT ONCE YOU CAN'T GET PAST THAT THEN WE'RE LOSING PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THIS IN SOME OTHER WAY AND THAT IT AND AND WE ARE NOT IN ANY WAY SEEKING TO REDUCE THE RIGOR OR UNDERVALUE THE IMPORTANCE OF SUBJECT MATTER KNOWLEDGE OF BASIC SKILLS BUT THESE ARE REQUIREMENTS THAT ONCE MET IN ONE OF THESE MYRIAD WAYS SIMPLY MEANS SOMEBODY IS READY TO BEGIN LEARNING HOW TO TEACH THEIR CONTENT BESTIVAL IT SHOULD PLAY IT SHOULD NOT PLAY THE KIND OF ROADBLOCK HE SAID SHOULD NOT PLAY THE KIND OF ROAD BLOCK THAT THEY HAVE PLAYED AT THE CANDIDATE CAN DEMONSTRATE THEY HAVE THE SKILLS WE SHOULD MOVE LIMITED PREPARATION AND INTO THE WORKFORCE AND THIS IS THE SET OF PROPOSALS WILL HELP US DO THAT THANK YOU THE OKAY I THINK IT WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OFF THE NEXT WITH MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ITEM WAS RELATED TO CTE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION ALWAYS A HOT TOPIC AMONG LEGISLATORS WILL HAVE THE L.

TWELVE I'LL SEE IF FUNDING IS PRIORITIZE FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN -- SO THIS IS REALLY TRYING TO CONTROL THE GROWTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE -- SERVING A DOUBLE STEP RECKLESS FELL EDUCATION PROGRAM AND NOW SQUEEZING OUT THE L. C. ABOUT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE K. TWELVE SCHOOLS RIGHT AND I MEAN IN THIS WHEN I CALLED FROM LONG BEACH AND I AGREE ON MANY THINGS EDUCATION BUT I I DO DIVERGE FROM HIM ON THE ON THE ADULT EDUCATION I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT -- AND YEAH WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF SPECULATION THAT YOU KNOW FOR WHATEVER REASON DID NOT GET THE EDUCATION -- THAT THEY NEED ARE NOW TRYING TO GET YOU KNOW BACK INTO -- NO MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE NEED NEED THAT EDUCATION GET THAT THIS IS YOUNG ANOTHER PATHWAY I THINK THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE -- I MEAN ARE WE UNDULY LIMITING THAT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW OR WE HELLO I'M KIND OF CONFUSED ON THAT ARE WE ALLOWING FOR THAT ARE WE NOT ALLOWED FOR THAT THAT QUESTION YEAH THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE WE'VE BEEN SEEING TREND THAT -- LCF AB GOING TOWARDS ADULTS HAS BEEN INCREASING IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS EACH YEAR SO I THINK WE WE JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT -- WANT TO CONTROL FOR THIS GROWTH BECAUSE WE DO SEE IT YOU KNOW TAKING A LARGER BITE OUT OF LCF AFTER YEAH CAN I INTERJECT FOR A FEW SECONDS ON THIS SO YOU KNOW THIS IS A REAL INTERESTING TOPIC THAT WE TRY TO TACKLE LAST YEAR DURING COVER NINETEEN AND WE COULDN'T AND WE DID HEAR FROM SOME OF THESE -- ADULT ED CHARTER SCHOOLS IN OUR DISTRICTS ARE DOING GREAT WORK ONE HERE IN OUR AREA MR GALLAGHER'S HIGHLANDS CHARTER WHICH IS SERVICE YEP AND THE PART BE YOUR PART DISTRICT IN MIND WHICH TAKES ADULTS -- PREDOMINATELY -- YEAH EASTERN EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS LATINOS SOME AFRICAN AMERICANS WELL FORMER INCARCERATED AND HAS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS RECORD AND I THINK THEY WENT FROM THE LAST FIVE YEARS FROM THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS TO MAYBE THREE THOUSAND SO A MASSIVE INCREASE SO THEY'RE DOING GOOD COULD WORK BUT I THINK THE QUESTION THAT THAT WE'RE ASKING IS IS THERE GETTING L. CFF DOLLARS AND I'M GONNA PAINT A BROAD STROKE HERE AND ASK FINANCED TO CLARIFY IT BUT THEY'RE GETTING HURT STUDENT LIKE WELL WELL NORTH OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A STUDENT MAYBE LIKE TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A STUDENT FOR LCS PATH CLASSIFYING THEM AS A FOURTH GRADER AT TENTH GRADER A FIRST GRADER BASED UPON THEIR LANGUAGE SKILLS WE HAVE THIS TRADITIONAL ADULTS SCHOOLS AND MY DISTRICT IN YOUR DISTRICT IN YOUR DISTRICT WHICH SERVE THE SAME POPULATION SAME ADULTS AND ADULTS SCHOOLS BY NICHOLAS DISTRACT SOME TO WERE IN LONG BEACH SAC CITY SO FORTH AND THEY GET ABOUT HALF OF THAT MONEY OR LESS AND SO THESE THESE ADULT CHARTER SCHOOLS IF I WAS THEM I DO THE SAME THING IF THERE'S TWO WINDOWS AND YOU WANT TO SERVE AN ADULT IS THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD EARNING ENGLISH YOU CAN GET REIMBURSED FROM THE STATE FOR FIVE THOUSAND STUDENT OVER HERE FOR FOURTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS WHY WOULD THEY GO TO THAT WINDOW THEY'RE GONNA GO TO THIS WINDOW AND SO WE'RE SEEING THIS INCREASE INCREASE SO IF YOU DID NOTHING THESE ADULT ED PROGRAMS WOULD GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE IT JUST HAPPENED THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO GO TO THE WINDOW NUMBER TWO RIGHT AND SO I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS NOT THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER TO RECOGNIZE THESE ADULT SCHOOLS BUT YOU KNOW HAVING THIS MASSIVE INCREASE YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS IT FAIR TO DO TRADITIONAL ADULT SCHOOLS AND IT CHIPS AWAY AT THE FUNDING FOR LCS FAST AND SO I THINK WHAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS COME UP WITH A FAIR COMPROMISE SO IF YOU CAN JUST UNRAVELING IN CCD E. OR R. OR AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHAT'S ROUGHLY THE -- PER STUDENT -- REIMBURSEMENT FOR TRADITIONAL ADULT SCHOOLS THROUGH SKIP THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSPECTION I'M GOING TO DEFER BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THAT ONE PRETTY MUCH -- WHEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS PUBLIC HAND FOR THE AT THE IS -- ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED FOR ON THE COMPLETE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM -- BUT FOR THOSE SPECIFIC NUMBERS WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT GET BACK TO YOU YEAH AND AND HOW MUCH DO STUDENTS WITH THESE AT THE ADULT CHARTER SCHOOLS GET ROUGHLY PER STUDENT HE WAS YEAH WELL LUCKY I K. SEEMS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE CORRECT ANSWERS THE DOLLARS AMOUNT BUT IF IF YOU CAN GIVE A BALLPARK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT BUT YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT THE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU GET THROUGH TRADITIONAL DAHLE SCHOOL LIKE SAC CITY HOUSES CHARLES JONES SCHOOL SKILL CENTER HERE ON STOCKTON BOULEVARD THREE MILES DOWN THE ROAD AND THEN JUST DOWN THE STREET THERE'S A CHARTER ADULTS SCHOOL AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU GET ALMOST THREE TIMES MORE IF YOU GET THE -- TELL CFF AMOUNT THROUGH THE CHARTER ADULT SCHOOL VERSUS A TRADITIONAL DAHLE SCHOOL IS THAT CORRECT OR AM I WRONG ASSEMBLY MEMBER BROUGHT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE A MARRIAGE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING ALL THE DESCRIPTION OF IT I THINK IT IS ACTUALLY TRUST WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE USING ONE OF THE AFFECT YOU ARE GENERATING A HIGHER AMOUNT OF FUNDING UNDER MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT RANGE ALSO NOTE THAT AND RAFI APART IF IT CONTINUES TO APPROPRIATIONS SO IF AND ONLY IF THE ATTENDANCE GO UP AND DOWN BALLOT IS AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDED IF YOU DON'T GET THE PROGRAM BACK FROM JUST ABOUT IT TOO DIFFICULT SOCIAL WHO THEN ALLOCATE THE FUNDS AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE PREFERRED FUNDING MODEL NOT A GREAT LIFT THE GROWTH FUNDING IS PROVIDED WITHIN THE BUDGET I'M IF NOT AUTOMATICALLY THAT IS A DIFFERENT YES SO THEY E. SOMEONE COULD GET BACK TO US WITH THE EXACT NUMBERS BUT YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT MY CHARACTER RACE AND CHARACTERIZATION IS IS FAIRLY ACCURATE AND I THINK THAT THE PROOF IS IN THE IN THE PUTTING HERE IS THAT -- A CHAR EDUCATION SHERM MAN FROM LONG BEACH SAYS DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH WE SHOULD GET RID OF ALL THIS AND WE DON'T HAVE SOME OF THE EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS YOU KNOW BANGING ON OUR DOOR RIGHT NOW THEY COULD BE LINING UP BUT WE'VE HEARD THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT FIELD GRANDFATHER CLAUSE AND HAVING YOU KNOW BASICALLY STABILIZE THIS THIS THIS PROGRAM LET THE CURRENT ONES THAT ARE OPERATING AT STILL DO WELL -- HAVING MORE REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE LINKED UP WITH -- ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE ACTUALLY QUALITY PROGRAMS AND MODELS THAT ACTUALLY WORK AND SO ON YEAH WE'RE GONNA KEEP WORKING ON THIS ISSUE BUT POTENTIALLY THIS IS A -- A DECENT -- COMPROMISE ASSEMBLYMEMBER VIDAK: SO MY QUESTION IS JUST IF IF WE'VE CLARIFIED THE RULES AND THE CHARGERS ARE ABIDING BY THE LAWS RULES THAT WE'VE CLARIFIED WHY ARE WE GONNA CAPIT SAME WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- LOWER CLASS CLEARING THE RULES BECAUSE CURRENT LAW IS KIND OF VAGUE ON THE DEFINITION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE EXCLUSIVELY IN PARTNERSHIP WE ALSO DON'T CURRENTLY COLLECT ANY INFORMATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME -- YOU KNOW WE WE ARE TRYING TO CONTROL THE GROWTH OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE COMPETING WITH ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND THAT IS THE REASON FOR FOR THE CAP THANK YOU YEAH AGAIN I THINK THIS IS A FAIR COMPROMISE AND IF WE DID NOTHING YOU WOULD SEE THESE CONTINUE TO PROLIFERATE HAVE A TENFOLD INCREASE AND I THINK NOW IT'S NEARLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE SPENT AND IT WAS JUST MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO SO IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS WE COULD BE GETTING CLOSE TO A BILLION AND THERE WILL BE NO ADULTS AT BECAUSE WHY WOULD AN ADULT AT SCHOOL STAINED BUSINESSES IT'S LIKE A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM OR HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAM IF YOU COULD GO TO ONE WINDOW FROM THE STATE AND GET A REIMBURSEMENT AND THE OTHER ONE GET TWICE AS MUCH MONEY OVER THERE WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE AND WE DON'T NUMBER ONE SO -- -- AND AND AND AGAIN THIS IS ONE OF SEVEN ISSUES HERE ON OUR ON THE BEST LIST BUT THIS IS THE ONE THAT CERTAINLY HAS THE MOST INTERESTING AND WE'LL SEE IF WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT TO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WAS AS MUCH CONSTERNATION FROM THE OPERATORS ACROSS CALIFORNIA EXCEPT FOR FIELD WHICH FOR CONTINUE TO TO TO TO LOOK INTO -- WITH THAT NO MORE QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE NUMBER FIVE ISSUE NUMBER SIX WE WILL HOLD UP IN ISSUE NUMBER FIVE CLARIFICATION THANK YOU ISSUE NUMBER SIX WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUILDING UPON THE THE THE INVESTMENT IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ONGOING AT THREE MILLION ONE TIME A GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM -- THIS THIS INVESTMENT IS ALSO CORRESPONDING WITH A PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE CHIU ADMINISTERED THE THE SYSTEM A WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY AS WELL AS THAT TRAILER BILL CLARIFIES THE GENERAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM ADDITIONALLY ARE BUILDING UPON THAT SYSTEM WHICH HAS TWO COMPONENTS AN ANALYTICAL AND OPERATIONAL A COMPONENT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION UP AN ONGOING AUGMENTATION THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION -- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE COLLEGE AND CAREER GUIDANCE INITIATIVE -- WHICH ASSIST STUDENTS AND PARENTS -- ADDS THE TRANSITION FROM THE CAPE FROM TWELVE SYSTEM AND A COLLEGE AND CAREER -- AND ADDITIONALLY IT -- I WOULD NOTE THAT WE HAVE SUBMITTED A JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE A LETTER REQUESTING THE USE OF A SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS A PART OF THE APPROPRIATION MADE IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DATA SYSTEM -- TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING THAT DATA SYSTEM -- WITH THAT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HONG WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE OKAY THANK YOU NEXT BIGGER MY NAME IS CATHY BOOTH AND I'M WITH WEST AT THE PROCESS FACILITATOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DATA SYSTEM I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU A VERY BRIEF UPDATE ABOUT PROGRESS ON ON THE PLANNING PROCESS TO DATE IN DECEMBER YOU RECEIVED A REPORTS THAT -- WAS COVERING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME THROUGH AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PLANNING PROCESS THAT'S INCLUDED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE TO DATE THAT INCLUDES ALL OF THE AGENCIES THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY BE PROVIDING DATA AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD BE THE USE OF THE DATA SYSTEM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS REALLY STRIKING ABOUT THE PLANNING PROCESS WAS THAT THE PANDEMIC MADE CLEAR HOW CRITICAL IT WAS TO HAVE THIS DATA SYSTEM THE PLANNING PARTNERS EASILY COULD HAVE SAID WE REALLY NEED TO ATTEND RUN THE FRONT LINES BUT

T. RECORD GIVEN THE AMBITIOUS NATURE OF THIS PROJECT THE PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFY IN STATUTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION BEGAN NOW USING THE POWER PLANNING PLANNING PROCESS AS WELL AS AGREED TO INDEPENDENT OLDER STUFF RIGHT ONCE THE PROJECT IS APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY FINALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE THIRD QUESTION ON PAGE THIRTY SEVEN OF THE AGENDA YES THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR THE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM BEYOND WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS CURRENTLY PROPOSING BUT THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT KNOW YET WHAT THE COSTS WILL BE THIS BILL MENTIONED -- THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A REPORT LATER ON IT'S GOING TO COME OUT IN JUNE BETTER SENSE OF THE ON GOING COSTS FOR THIS PROJECT BECAUSE IT IS A MULTI YEAR PROCESS IN THE MEANTIME THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER APPROVING SOME AMOUNT OF THE REMAINING SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING THAT MR FERGUSON MENTIONED AND USE THAT FOR GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS STAFF TO BEGIN THE POWER GOT THE APPELLATE PROCESS AND WE WOULD KNOW THAT BY USING THE POWER PROCESS LEGISLATURE WOULD ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING BETTER COST ESTIMATES FOR THIS PROJECT THANK YOU AND HAPPY JANET ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS AGENDA ITEM -- MISTER MCCARTY YES THE STOCK DOWN ON THE MISTER SMITH BY IT AS YEAH I THANK THANK YOU I MISS MCCARTY I YOU KNOW I WAS GONNA SHARE MY OPINION ABOUT THIS EFFORT -- I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE DOING THIS IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHY WE NEED THIS I HEAR OTHER STATES HAVE A HAS GREAT JUST BECAUSE OTHER STATES HAVE IT SOME OTHER STATES HAVE DOESN'T MEAN WE NEED TO HAVE IT I JUST YOU KNOW I THINK I'M WITNESSING A BOONDOGGLE ON A MONEY SUCK AND IT'S STARTING RIGHT NOW AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA AND THIS MONEY SHOULD GO INTO THE CLASSROOM THIS MONEY SHOULD GOING TO SUPPORTING STUDENTS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN HAS BEEN PRESENTED HERE I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE ADVOCATING FOR THIS NON PROFITS EXCITED THAT PROBABLY BENEFIT FROM IT BUT I DON'T SEE -- THE NEED FOR THIS MYSELF NOR DO I SEE THIS AS A WISE EXPENDITURE THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER VIA THAT IS YEAH THE PROPOSED GOVERNING BOARD HEAVILY WEIGHS ON DATA CONTRIBUTORS ADAM AS WELL AS EDUCATION SEGMENTS BUT THERE'S NO BOARD POSITIONS DESIGNATED FOR THE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE -- AND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT CD NDSS WOULD HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE TOPIC BUT -- AND THEY'RE ALSO ONLY TWO BOARD POSITIONS SPECIFIC TO THE WORK FORCE AND THERE'S ALSO AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S FOUR APPOINTEES -- AND THE LEGISLATURE'S TWO APPOINTEES IS THERE OPPORTUNITY -- NEED TO TO DO THIS A LITTLE MORE -- FAIRLY BALANCED AND AND GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE EARLY LEARNING I'M COMMUNITY AND AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE -- HOW CAN THERE BE BROADER SO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FINANCE HOW CAN THERE BE BROADER REPRESENTATION ALONG THE CRADLE TO CAREER CONTINUUM -- VIA THIS BOARD AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER SIX ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE APPOINTEES THAT WOULD BALANCE THE DATA CONTRIBUTORS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS PROVIDE EACH HOUSE WITH FOUR APPOINTEES THE SAME NUMBER AS THE GOVERNOR CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE SO I I THINK WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE WOULD NOTE IS THE TRAILER BILL DOES ALLOW FOR THE BOARD TO HAVE EX OFFICIO MEMBERS AND TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION ADDITIONALLY ALL OF THE BOARD MEETINGS WOULD BE TRANSPARENT THEY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO BACK MAKING THE PUBLICLY NOTICED THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC INPUT WOULD MOVE FORWARD -- AND CERTAINLY -- YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE GUNS -- LARGELY REPRESENT OTHER THAN THE CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS PROVIDERS -- TO THE SYSTEM SO I I MEAN AGAIN AN EX OFFICIO IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN A MEMBER CONSIDERATION FOR ALLOWING THE LEGISLATURE WHO WE SHOULD BE A PARTNER IN THIS EFFORT AND I WOULD ALLOWING US TO HAVE EQUAL REPRESENTATION -- I I THINK WOULD BE A GOOD MOVE THANK YOU OKAY FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THIS

TWELVE ISSUES SO MAYBE WE'LL HEAR FROM C. S. B. A. R. ACTS ABOUT THIS LATER MISTER MISTER O'DONNELL YEAH I THINK OF YOU KNOW ME YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY HERE I THINK VERY CAUTIOUSLY LISTEN -- THE DATA SHOWS THE STUDENTS GO GO TO COLLEGE BECAUSE THEY FILLED OUT THE FASTER OKAY AND IF ALL THE FASTER BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO COLLEGE GETTING THAT'S WHAT ISSUE BUT WHAT I'M MOST CONCERNED ABOUT HERE IS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A POLICY THAT COULD PUT STUDENTS IN JAIL ULTIMATELY OR HAVE THEM DEPORTED YES SOMEONE IS ON THE GROUND I THINK WE NEED TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE WHO'S ON THE GRAHAM WHO'S BEEN ON THE GROUND OKAY GOOD I HAVE -- HAD STUDENTS FALL THE FASTER MY POSTURE MANY TIMES IN CANCER COMMAND IT'S A TOMORROW OVER THE COUNCIL'S COME IN EVEN IF ALL THE FASTER -- BRING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER BRING YOUR NUMBER IF YOU HAVE ONE AND AS I REPEATED IN THE PAST MANY STUDENTS THAT MIGHT GO HOME AND SAY HEY MOM DAD I NEED MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND FIND OUT THEY ARE NOT DOCUMENTED FOR THE FIRST TIME ANY OTHER STUDENTS DON'T FIND THAT OUT AND THEY PROBABLY GO AHEAD AND FILL UP THE FAST THAT COULD PUT THEM IN A PRECARIOUS LEGAL SITUATION GOING FORWARD SO I THINK HOW THIS IS EMPLOYED ON THE GROUND -- EASE IS IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT REALLY THAT THROUGH THIS REALLY NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH BECAUSE I KNOW TO BE ON THE OUTSIDE SOUNDS GREAT OH MY GOSH FOR DOING A GREAT THING BUT YOUR MIGHT REALLY YOU PUT IN A CERTAIN GROUP OF STUDENTS AND A VERY BAD SPOT AND THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW EVEN FOR A COUPLE YEARS RIGHT -- BECAUSE THE THE THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS MIGHT I'D COME UP TO LATER BUT I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS I KNOW IT SOUNDS GREAT OKAY AND THE MISSION IS GREAT THE GOAL IS GREAT BUT HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED IS KEY HERE THERE NEEDS TO BE -- IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS GAME YOU'RE SO IN LOVE WITH IT THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT OF EDUCATION ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOOD THIS IS DONE ON THE GROUND LEVEL AND STILL WE WILL BE STATE SENATE AS SOME WILL FILL IT OUT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE QUOTE UNQUOTE A REQUIREMENT RIGHT THEY'RE NOT EVEN GONNA GET THEIR NOT GOING TO GET THE MESSAGE OR SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING TO FILL IT OUT WHATEVER -- ARE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CATCH THAT THEY SHOULDN'T FILL IT OUT AND I I KNOW THIS SOUNDS GREAT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AGAIN BUT I JUST THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE ALTMAN -- IMPLICATIONS THIS FOR SOME STUDENTS BECAUSE MAY VERY WELL BE NEGATIVE I SAY THIS AS SOMEONE WHO'S CONCERNED FOR THOSE STUDENTS TO SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS PROBABLY FILL OUT THE FASTER AND IS HAD TO SAY TO STUDENTS HEY IN A FEW DAYS YOU HAVE YOUR NUMBER GO TO THIS CLASSROOM TODAY YOU KNOW I HAVE YOUR NUMBER STAY OVER HERE BECAUSE WE WERE VERY CAREFUL IN ENSURING THAT STUDENTS DIDN'T FILL US OUT OF THEY DIDN'T HAVE A NUMBER BUT ALL THAT SOME STILL DO WELL BUT THEY DID -- SO WITH THAT I I THINK I PRESENTED MY CONCERN MULTIPLE TIMES AND IT FROM SOMEONE WHO'S DONE THIS AND I TURN IT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GALLAGHER INVITED US YEAH I WOULD ONCE AGAIN AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH -- AND I THINK THIS IS PROBLEMATIC -- I I GET THE INTENTION BEHIND IT BUT I THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA BE PUTTING OUR SCHOOLS AT A TIME WHEN THERE IS A WHOLE LOT TO MANAGE -- AND AND LOOK I MEAN COMBINED WITH THE BUT I THINK A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED -- BY MISTER O'DONNELL -- IT AT SOME POINT HOW MUCH TO EXPECT OF PEOPLE TO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THIS THEMSELVES YEAH -- YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY I THINK THERE'S A LOT OUT REACH THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE WE COULD ARGUE MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE EVEN MORE -- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WITH PUTTING THE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU KNOW FOR ENSURING THIS GETS FILLED OUT INSTEAD OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS SEEKING THE AID SEEKING TO GET THE YOU KNOW THE BENEFIT OF THESE PROGRAMS AND TO TO SEEK THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION TO ME SEEMS MISPLACED I THINK IT YEAH LOOK I THINK AS WITH MANY THINGS ACROSS THE BOARD I STILL THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY BE ON THE INDIVIDUAL TO ALTERNATELY ASSERT THEMSELVES TO APPROACH -- WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE PEOPLE LETTING PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE WHAT BENEFITS ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM BUT ULTIMATELY IF YOU DO IT ALL FOR THEM THERE'S REALLY NO INDIVIDUAL INCENTIVE MOTIVATION -- AND I DON'T THINK THAT ALL TO ME THAT'S GOING TO BE A RECIPE FOR SUCCESS KNOW THE WRONG APPROACH TO THIS AND A AND IN ADDITION TO BEING WHAT I THINK WILL PROBABLY BE A PRETTY EXPENSIVE MANDATE -- AND REQUIRE A LOT OF ADMINISTRATION TIME ON BEHALF OF OUR SCHOOLS OKAY THANK YOU CINEMA PROVIDE US I WANT TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE AND YOU KNOW I I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH GOVERNMENT CONSTANTLY TELLING US WHAT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO AND I MEAN WHY NOT IS THERE A CONSIDERATION OF A WAIVER IS THERE ARE FOR WAIVER AND OR STUDENTS OR PARENTS TO REJECT I'M HAVING TO APPLY I MEAN IF YOU ARE AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD AS A SENIOR OR EVEN A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD SINGER AND YOU'VE DECIDED THAT YOU WANT TO GO INTO THE UNITED STATES MILITARY AND SAVE AND AND AND SERVE OUR COUNTRY YOU KNOW WHY WOULD YOU HAVE TO APPLY FOR THIS -- BE REQUIRED TO APPLY FOR THIS SO IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY -- D. TO TO WAIVE THIS REQUIREMENT FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS ONE AND TWO WHAT WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FAST BUT AND AND THE C. A. D. D. A. -- APPLICATIONS GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER COMING UP FINANCED ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION YES THE CURRENT LANGUAGE ALLOWS A STUDENT OR A PARENT TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENTS TO APPLY FOR TOP CENTER FOR THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION ON YOUR SECOND NO REGARDING THE DIFFERENCE COLLEAGUE -- AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION SO THEY CAN TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO APPLICATIONS HE MISSED CHÁVEZ J. BREMNER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION -- THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION IS STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO MIRROR THE PROCESS SO THE QUESTIONS ARE ALL THE SAME AS THAT ARE PUT BEFORE STUDENTS TO COMPLETE THE BASS THAT THE ONLY REAL DIFFERENCE IS WHICH STUDENTS A STUDENTS WHO SUBMITTED THE ABSOLUTE ARE THOSE WERE ELIGIBLE UNDER A TITLE FOR -- AT THE END FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID -- PARLANCE THIRD ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID AND STUDENT THAT APPLIED IT THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION OUR STUDENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR IN STATE TUITION RATES -- BY -- DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY NEED A NUMBER OF CRITERIA -- THAT ALLOW LONG TIME RESIDENTS OF THIS STATE WHO MAY NOT BE U. S. CITIZENS TO STILL APPLY AND ACCESS STATE FINANCIAL IT THANK YOU AND IS IT THE ADMINISTRATION OPEN TO DELAYING FOR A YEAR AS WE KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL AND FAST THE APPLICATION IS GOING TO CHANGE IN THE TWENTY IS IT THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AWARD YEAR OF OUR TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WORK YEAR I MEAN WHY IF WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO CHANGE AND AND THEREFORE ARE DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE IT WHAT WHAT WHAT AND HOW WHY WOULDN'T WE DELAY GOVERNMENT CHÁVEZ WITH THE COMING OF FINANCE I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR FEEDBACK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS THANK YOU YEAH I DID I JUST WANT TO AND INTERJECT ON THIS IF ANY OF YOU EVER BEEN TO THOSE CAST RECALLS WORKSHOPS THAT EXTREMELY COMPLICATED FELT THIS FORM AND EIGHT QUESTIONS A THIRTY SIX I THINK WILL MAKE IT EASIER WHETHER WITHOUT WE HAVE THIS CHANGE BUT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HAVE THEIR STUDENTS -- YOU KNOW FILL OUT THIS APPLICATION I THINK THIS IS THAT A GOOD IDEA I KNOW SOMEONE MEMBER REYES HAD BILLS ON THIS TO TRY TO PUSH THIS DIRECTION HER IDEA WAS GONNA MAKE A REQUIREMENT STUDENTS HOW TO DO THIS FOR FOR -- GRADUATION AND WE GOT PUSHED BACK FROM A LOT OF THE ADVOCATES OUT THERE AND AND AND EQUITY GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA SAYS WELL YOU'RE GOING TO PUNISH STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE COUNSELORS AND HOW HOW DO THEY HOW CAN THEY EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO ITSELF TURNING IT AROUND WITH HAVING THESE OPT OUT OPTIONS FOR DISTRICTS AND STUDENTS I THINK MAKES SENSE I LOOK WITH WE TALKED A FEW WEEKS AGO ABOUT THAT THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IN THAT RESEARCH DONE SHOWS THAT IF YOU ASK A STUDENT WHO DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE AND THEY'RE LIKE EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE WHY DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE THEY SAY MONEY WITHIN ITS COST TOO MUCH QUESTION NUMBER TWO DID YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS PROGRAM CALLED THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS THAT SAID ENTITLEMENT IF YOU APPLY WHEN YOU'RE EIGHTEEN IN HIGH SCHOOL NOW IT NOW SO THIS REALLY IS A DIFFERENCE MAKER SO WE WANT TO FOCUS ON INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS AND FOCUS ON OUR NEEDS FOR EMPLOYERS TO GET MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE WHY WE WOULDN'T GO ALL IN FOR THIS -- I WE DO NEED TO BE CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS DON'T FILL OUT THE FASTER WHEN THEY REALLY SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON THE DREAM ACT APPLICATION I'M CERTAIN DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO MANY LATINO AND IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE GOING TO FIGURE THIS OUT RIGHT AWAY TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS DON'T PUT THEMSELVES IN LEGAL PERIL BUT -- EQUITY GROUPS ADVOCACY GROUPS SEE THE BENEFITS FAR OUTWEIGH THE DRAWBACKS I KNOW THE ONLY ISSUE THAT I WANT TO ADDRESS I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE LAYER DURING PUBLIC COMMENT IS A SCHOOL

AND A ON THAT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS BUT OVERALL OUR ARE RECOMMENDATION HERE IS SIMILAR TO OTHER ONGOING PROPOSALS IS TO REVISIT OF THE INITIATIVES HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON THE STATE'S BUDGET CONVENTION OKAY HAVE A GOOD ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YEAH WELL MAYBE YOU CAN JUST SELL MY UNDERSTANDING YOUR TO CONCERNS ARE ONE ONGOING VERSES ONE TIME AND IT IS WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL DOING ONGOING STAFF AT BUT TO CAN YOU REMIND US YOUR I DON'T REMEMBER THAT THIS THE FEEDBACK HE GAVE US -- ON THESE TWO PROPOSALS HE HAD SENT SOME CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM ON ON ON -- THESE EFFORTS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS CAN YOU -- AND LIGHTNESS THERE SURE FORCING FOR THE BOOKS PROGRAM -- ARE CONCERNED WITH A FEW CONCERNS FOR ONE CONCERN IS THAT -- LIBRARIES ALREADY SPEND A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LOCAL RESOURCES TO PURCHASING MATERIALS -- SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FUNDING THAN WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED IN PREVIOUS YEARS DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING ON SO IT IT DOES ARE DISCOVERING THINGS THAT -- LIBRARIES TO COVER OTHER LOCAL RESOURCES FOR THE BOOKS PROGRAM IS THAT ON SOME PREVIOUS ANALYSES HAVE FOUND THAT THEY GENERATE SAVINGS FOR LOCAL LIBRARIES ARE WE THINK THOSE LIBRARIES COULD USE THOSE SAVINGS TO HELP SUPPORT OF THE BOOKS PROGRAMMING ON ONE BASIS AND THEN THERE ARE THEIR CONCERN IT'S ABOUT THIS SORT OF ISSUE EMISSIONS SCOPE SO -- IS THE BOOKS PROGRAM WHAT WE THINK COULD BE JUSTIFIED FOR SOME OF WORLD LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS THAT WAS SORT OF THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE PROGRAM WAS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO LIBRARY RESOURCES FOR WORK HOLD LEVERAGE RESTRICTIONS THAT -- I CAN'T EASILY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THINGS LIKE INTERLIBRARY LOAN IT MIGHT BE VERY EXPENSIVE FOR THOSE BY BURGER SECTIONS ARE NOT ALL THE PARTICIPATING PARTICIPATING JURISDICTIONS ARE WORLD THERE ARE -- SOME WESTWORLD JURISDICTIONS CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM SO WE THINK THAT THE STATE CAN ALSO WORK WITH THE STATE LIBRARY DO -- MAYBE YOU FIND A WAY TO MAKE THE SCORE BELOW MORE TARGETED ON OF THE MOST WORLD THIS JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE ANALYSTS ON THE LIBRARY INITIATIVE ARE CONCERNED THERE IS ON MORE THAT -- YOU JUST COMPARED TO THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A LOT ABOUT THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS DOLLARS THE STATE RECEIVES IN FUNDING FOR -- -- SUMMER LUNCH PROGRAMS IT'S FUNDING WOULD BE RELATIVELY SMALL HAVE A FAIRLY SMALL IMPACT -- AND SO JUST FOR THAT REASON IT MAY NOT BE SORT OF THE HIGHEST ONGOING PRIORITY FOR THE STATE'S MOTOR SOME OF OUR PAST -- -- CONCERNS WOULD RAISE AT BOTH A NATIONAL SURE THANK YOU CAN I GO BACK TO OUR STATE LIBRARIAN MISTER LUCAS AND HAVE YOU RESPOND REALLY TO THE SECOND SET OF ISSUES THE FIRST ISSUE IS JUST A MONEY THING FOR US TO DECIDE DO WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY ONGOING SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET OR OR ONE TIME BUT IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO THAT THE THE POLICY -- CRITIQUE AND FEEDBACK FROM THE L. A. R. THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL THANK YOU IT BE MY PLEASURE -- WELL JASON'S RIGHT I MEAN INITIALLY THE ZIP BOOKS PROGRAM WAS WAS FIRST PILOTED IN RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA FOR FURTHER REASONS HE WAS ARTICULATING RIGHT SO IF YOU LIVE IN A RURAL PART OF CALIFORNIA GOING INTO TOWN -- IS -- ALL DAY AFFAIR AND SO IF YOU CAN CALL THE LIBRARY AND ASK FOR A BOOK AND THEY ORDER IT SHOWS UP IN YOUR MAILBOX ALSO AS JASON SAID IT'S ALSO A CHEAPER WAY OF DOING BUSINESS BE TERRIFIC IF LOCAL LIBRARIES WHERE THEY CAN YOU KNOW TAKE SOME OF THE SAVINGS THEY ACHIEVE FROM THIS PROGRAM HELP ALBEIT ONLY A MILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE AND PUT THAT TO -- IMPROVING THEIR LOCAL BUDGETS SITUATIONS AND THEN THE THIRD POINT I HEARD WAS YOU KNOW THIS MAY WORK BETTER IN RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE AND WE DO KNOW THAT IT DOES WORK BETTER IN RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE BUT IT WAS A PILOT PROJECT AND SO WE EXPLORED USING IT IN OTHER PLACES AND I WAS SURPRISED -- THE FEEDBACK I GOT FROM THE GLENDA WILLIAMS THE THE LIBRARY DIRECTOR IN LONG BEACH WHAT SHE SAID THIS IS A TREMENDOUS PROGRAM FOR US PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS WHERE YOU KNOW MOST OF MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING SERVED BY THE LIBRARY MAIL ISN'T SOMETHING THAT THEY REALLY WANT TO SEE SO HAVING THESE BOOKS ARRIVES -- IS IS BOTH YOU KNOW SAVINGS TO US THE LIBRARY AND KIND OF THE SOCIAL GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WE HELP LUNCH AT THE LIBRARY WELL YEAH YOU KNOW WE MEAN WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FEEDING HUNGRY POOR KIDS DURING THE SUMMER BUT WE'RE STILL AT A POINT WHERE FIVE ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE KIDS WHO GETS A FREE OR SUBSIDIZED SCHOOL MEALS DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR RIGHT ONLY ONE OF THEM IS GET IN THE MAIL IN THE SUMMER SO WHAT WHEN SAID SENATOR MITCHELL AND HER STAFF THOUGHT OF THIS CONCEPT I MEAN THEY'RE THINKING WAS OKAY YES WE HAVE PLACES WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE TWO THOUSAND LOCATIONS WHERE SUMMER LUNCHES GET SIR BUT THERE'S LOCATIONS THAT HAVE A FALLING NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING THEM SO WHY NOT BRING THE POWER OF LIBRARIES I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING WHAT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS EXTRAORDINARY WAS THE LAST YEAR RIGHT LIBRARIES ARE CLOSED NINETY EIGHT LIBRARIES -- CONDUCTED YOU KNOW WE HANDED OUT LUNCHES THROUGH THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDED THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEALS SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY KIND OF CREATIVITY CRAFT KITS AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FREE BOOKS SO THOSE THREE HUNDRED MEALS THAT THEY GAVE OUT LIKE AT CURBSIDE DELIVERY AND DRIVE THRU SORT OF OPERATIONS THAT'S TEN THOUSAND MORE THAN HAPPENED IN TWENTY NINETEEN SO THANK I MEAN I'D BE THE FIRST PERSON TO AGREE THAT THE LIBRARIES AREN'T HAVING LIBRARIES SERVE MEALS TO HUNGRY POOR KIDS IN THE SUMMER ISN'T GOING TO GET US FROM ONE OUT OF FIVE KIDS HAVING A LUNCH BUT IT BRINGS A LOT OF SECONDARY WELL I DON'T THINK THEIR SECONDARY BUT A LOT OF ANCILLARY BENEFITS TO THE TABLE LIKE THE COOL STUFF THAT YOU FIND IN EVERY LIBRARY IN CALIFORNIA I WOULD SAY AND I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK TO ORGANIZE THIS BUT THERE'D BE A LOT OF BENEFIT IN GETTING EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED IN FEEDING HUNGRY POOR KIDS IN THE SUMMER JUST SIT DOWN AND TALK TO ONE ANOTHER TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DO A BETTER YEAH I I'D I'D LIKE THE CONCEPT OF HAVING AND THE MEALS THAT I'VE SEEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO OR PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND TALK TO OUR LIBRARIAN BECAUSE ASKED ABOUT THEIR EFFORTS HERE AND YOU KNOW I I I KNOW THESE ARE AT THE TOP YEAH I KNOW THE PROGRAM SOMETIMES ARE AT AT SCHOOL SITES WHERE THERE SIMPLY CLOSED AND PEOPLE JUST DRIVE UP BUT I'M NOT GONNA SAY I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT EVERY FAMILY'S GONNA PARK THEIR CAR GET SOME LUNCH AND GO TO THE LIBRARY AND CHECK OUT A BOOK AND SEE WHAT ACTIVITIES THEY HAVE BUT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IF THEY DON'T GO THERE TO PICK UP FOOD AND SO JUST THAT JUST THE SPIN OFF BENEFIT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS CERTAINLY HELPFUL AND AND THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON YOU KNOW FEEDING MORE HUNGRY KIDS DURING -- DURING THE SUMMER FRANKLY ALL YEAR ROUND YOU KNOW -- HAS A BIG IMPACT ON ON HEALTH AND LEARNING AND TO START HEALTH LIFESTYLES IN CALIFORNIA SO -- YEAH THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO SUPPORT HE HAD GENERALLY AND WAS PART OF ONE TIME AND -- IF WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ONGOING LOOKED YOU KNOW MOST LIKELY -- PUT PUT FOR THIS THE REKO FROM THE GOVERNOR -- IN THEM AFTER THE MAY REVISE WILL HOLD OPEN FOR NOW QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SAYING NONE -- THANK YOU SO NEXT WE'LL GO TO THE SITE WITH STATE LIBRARY ONE TIME PROPOSALS SO START WITH BERMAN TO FINANCE LA ON IN STATE LIBRARIAN OKAY HELLO AT JENNIFER LOUIS AGAIN -- MISTER CHAIR AT -- WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE STATE LIBRARY'S ONE TIME AUGMENTATION OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS MENTIONED EARLIER REFLECTS EMPHASIS ON ACCESS EQUITY AND BUDGET RESILIENCY WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ARE ONE TIME DINNER FINE ARE DEDICATED TO THE LOCAL LIBRARY COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND BOOK MOBILES AND EARLY LEARNING AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AT THE COMPLETE MY PRESENTATION ON THE STATE LIBRARY'S ONE TIME PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU L. A. L. OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE OF THIS ITEM -- DIFFERS FOR THE FIVE MILLION FOUR EDUCATION ENRICHMENT GRANTS AND THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR BOOK MOBILES SALT A TOUCH ON EACH ISSUE FOR THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WHAT WE'RE CALLING EDUCATION ENRICHMENT GRANTS YOU TO BE THINGS FOR EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS AFTER SCHOOL INITIATIVES -- WE THINK THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT BECAUSE WILL DUPLICATE A LOT OF ACTIVITIES THAT THE STATE PROVIDES FUNDING FOR -- TO K. TWELVE SCHOOLS AND EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDERS NOT ONLY DUPLICATE IN TERMS OF THE ON GOING FUNDING THAT STATE PROVIDES BUT ALSO ONE TIME FUNDING FOR LEARNING LOSS BEING PROVIDED TO THE EDUCATION AGENCIES I'M IN ADDITION IT COMPARED TO THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE PROVIDERS SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION AGENCIES FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION EARLY LEARNING FROM THIS INITIATIVE LIKELY WHATEVER PRETTY SMALL IMPACT SO FOR THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT ALL THE PAUSE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CONTRAST THE FOR THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR BOOK MOBILES WE THINK THIS COULD AMERICA GREATER CONSIDERATION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR ONE THING THIS INITIATIVE IS MORE TAILORED TOWARDS -- SPECIFIC LIBRARY SERVICES WE ALSO THINK IT'S IT'S POSSIBLE COULD HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE PANDEMIC AND SO FAR THAT IT HELPS OUR LIBRARY PATRONS ACCESS LIBRARY RESOURCES ON WHEN THEY CAN'T ATTEND THEM THE MAYOR BRANCH CAMPUS SO FOR THE THREE GREAT REASONS WE RECOMMEND THAT FOR THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS YOU WAY THIS PROPOSAL -- AGAINST RATHER ONE TIME PRIORITIES WHEN YOU GET TO THE REDUCTION THANK YOU THANK YOU WE HAVE MISTER LUCAS FROM THE STATE LIBRARY FOCUS ON THE THE L. A. PROPOSAL TO NOT APPROVE THE -- THE -- FIVE MILLION FOR EARLY LEARNING AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS RIGHT GREG LUCAS FROM THE STATE LIBRARY THE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IN ONE TIME MONEY IT'S THE SECOND YEAR THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS DONE MR MADE THIS INVESTMENT -- WE SKIPPED LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE BUDGETARY ISSUES -- THE IT'S EXCLUDING THE LOCAL LIBRARY AND REMOTE SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDING LIBRARY SERVICES THE THREE MILLION PLEASE FIVE MILLION THE JASON WAS DISCUSSING IS THAT IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING TO HELP PROMOTE LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN LIBRARIES AND OTHER EXAMPLE IN THE BEST EXAMPLE I CAN GIVE IS IN EL DORADO COUNTY -- THEY HAVE FIVE COMMUNITY HELPS YOU CAN GO ON THE FIRST FIVE WEBSITE THERE AND IT'LL SHOW THESE FIVE COMMUNITY HUBS AND YOU CAN GO TO THE COMMUNITY HELP BUTTON ON A CERTAIN DAY YOU CAN GET A WELLNESS -- YOUR KIDS CAN GET A WELLNESS EXAMINATION ON ANOTHER DAY THERE'S A FAMILY LITERACY SPECIALISTS THERE IS OTHER SERVICES TO HELP YOU COORDINATE GETTING CHILD CARE SIGN UP FOR WORK THAT KIND SO IF IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP RIGHT IF YOU CLICK ON THE TO UNITY HUBS ALL FIVE OF THE COMMUNITY HUBS ARE THE LIBRARIES AND CAN CALDERON ACCOUNT SO CREATING THOSE PARTNERSHIPS -- IS KIND OF A NEWER THING FOR LIBRARIES AND THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE OFFERED THIS GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP PROMOTE THAT AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THERE'S A PIECE OF THAT THAT GOES TO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING BUT -- WHO WE HAD BUDGET REQUESTS FROM ALL PLACES ALL OVER THE STATE THAT WANTED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE WHAT EL DORADO WAS DOING ALL RIGHT AND PASADENA FOR EXAMPLE -- DECLARED THEMSELVES TO BE A CITY OF KIDS AND WHAT'S WORSE TRYING TO CREATE THE SAME SORT OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEMSELVES ANOTHER LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCIES SO THAT'S MAINLY THE INTENT BEHIND THIS IS TO TRY AND INCENTIVIZE -- LIBRARIES TO WORK WITH OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES AND AND AND IN FACT YOU CAN'T GET A GRANT UNDER THAT PROGRAM UNLESS YOU WALK YOU A LIBRARY WALK IN THE DOOR WITH ANOTHER LOCAL PARK WHETHER THAT'S FIRST FIVE OR YOUR LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE WORD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OKAY WHAT WILL I I WILL NOTE THAT IN IN GENERAL -- THIS DECIDE COMMITTEE AND THE ASSEMBLY HAS STRONG SUPPORT FOR A STATE LIBRARY AN EARLY LEARNING AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE TWO OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON THIS AS A TRY FACT THAT SOMETHING THAT IS IS THAT THE STRONG INTEREST UP AT ME AND I THINK OUR OUR OUR COMMITTEE SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH REVISIT THIS -- AFTER THE NAY REVISED THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD OPEN AND SINGLE COMMENTS ON ON THIS ISSUE I BEFORE WE GO TO THE LAST ISSUE WITH HASTINGS CALLS A LOT MEMBER I RAMOS -- YOU KNOW WAS TAKE CARE OTHER BUSINESS DURING THE PRESENTATIONS ON AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AS WELL AS THE FAST THE PROPOSAL SO WANTED TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ON THOSE TWO ISSUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR ON THE ADULT EDUCATION ARE WE DID RECEIVE A LETTER FROM THE -- LATINO CAUCUS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE LATINO CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF A PROGRAM THAT IS SPECIFICALLY FOR ADULT FARMWORKERS IT'S THE EPIC FEEL TO PROGRAM FOR ADULT EDUCATION AND SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THIS PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED A VARIETY OF SERVICES TO FARMWORKERS INCLUDING ENGLISH AND CITIZENSHIP PROGRAMS CAREER TRAINING AND HIGH SCHOOL CLASSES IT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OF NOT FUNDING THE EPIC PROGRAM THERE IS SERIOUS CONCERN -- BECAUSE THE THE EPIC AS A PRIMARILY SERVES MIX STATUS ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY FOUR IF IT IS THE IF HEALTH SPEND THEIR REQUEST OF THE LATINO CAUCUS AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT -- IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE PRESERVE THE EPIC FIELD PROGRAM IN ORDER TO CONTINUE MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF ARE DEALT FARMWORKER COMMUNITY AT A MINIMUM THIS COMMITTEE THIS COMMITTEE -- MAY WANT TO RECONSIDER EXEMPTING FIELD OR EPIC FIELD FROM THE PROPOSED BUDGET CHANGE FOR DURATION OF NO LESS THAN FIVE YEARS I THINK NOW MORE THAN EVER OUR PRIORITY MUST BE TO GIVE OUR WORK FORCE AND THE CENTRAL WORKERS LIKE I FARMWORKERS THE EDUCATIONAL SUPPORTS THEY NEED TO SUCCEED THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO ADD THOSE COMMENTS -- MISTER CHAIR ON ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN ELSE TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT THANK YOU FOR FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY ALSO TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS AND I WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE THE HEARING FROM MY OFFICE AND THERE ARE FEW COMMENTS -- AND I WANTED TO BE SURE TO ADDRESS THEM -- PHELPS FOR HIS THAT HAS BEEN OF GREAT INTEREST TO ME AND I'VE AS AS YOU KNOW HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF BILLS IN THIS SPACE THERE'S A COMMENT MADE THAT -- THAT THIS CAN GET STUDENTS DEPORTED OR INCARCERATED SHOULD THEY FILL OUT THE FORM AND I WHILE I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS IT'S THIS TYPE OF FEAR MONGERING THAT IS EXTREME TAILORING CAR OR DEPORTATION MOST FAMILIES IN THESE SITUATIONS THE SITUATIONS DO FEAR -- IT AND WE DON'T NEED TO ADD ANYTHING TO THIS ACCORDING TO IMMIGRANTS RISING IF YOU FILL OUT THE WRONG APPLICATION THEY WILL PLACE THE APPLICATION ON HOLD -- AND HOUSE OF NOW AND I HAVE MY STAFF TO LOOK INTO THIS WE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY CASES OF INCARCERATION OR DEPORTATION THAT IS HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF ANYONE FILLING OUT OF THE LOT THE THE WRONG FORM WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO PROVIDE EVERY OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR STUDENTS ANOTHER COMMENT WAS MADE THAT STUDENTS TO FILL OUT THE FASTBALL OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY GOING TO COLLEGE NOT STUDENTS WERE EXPLORING THAT OPTION -- AROUND THIS IS AS YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT ENTIRELY TRUE -- IT'S OUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND THEY NEED THAT HELP -- IS IT THERE WERE COMMENTS -- ALSO MADE THAT WE NEED SELF RESPONSIBILITY FOR FAMILIES AND STUDENTS TO GET THIS DONE -- THE STATUS QUO WAS WE KNOW IS NOT WORKING I DURING THE ONGOING ONGOING PANDEMIC THE GREATEST DECLINES IN CALIFORNIA PHELPS FOR COMPLETION HAS BEEN WITHIN THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE YOUNGER STUDENTS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO HELP THE YOUTH THAT OUR STUDENTS FILL OUT THE FAST REFORM WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A GREATER POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WILL GO TO COLLEGE ANOTHER COMMENT WAS THAT WE NEED LESS GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE SAME THING I I THINK THAT -- THE THE THE FAST FOR SHOULD NOT BE SHOULDERED SOLELY BY THE EARLY EIGHTIES I CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION LEADS A HANDFUL OF ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS TO ENSURE FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION COMPLETION THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEY'VE CASH FOR COLLEGE WORKSHOP WHEN WE'VE HAD THOSE ARE THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS PROGRAM WE DID THAT AS WELL THROUGH THE DISTRICT THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY THESE TRAININGS WALKED THE ATTENDEES THROUGH HOW TO FILL OUT THE FORM AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE ANOTHER THING ANOTHER COMMA THAT WAS MADE IS THAT THIS IS TOO LARGE A BURDEN ON OUR SCHOOLS WE DO HAVE TWO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA OF ALBERDI UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND PERRIS UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH HAVE ENACTED THE PHELPS FOR KEITA COMPLETION POLICY CHANGE AND HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT OF POSITIVE RESULTS IN VAL VERDE THE COMPLETION -- COMPLETION RATE HAS INCREASED BY FOURTEEN PERCENT FROM SIXTY NINE TO EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF IF WE DON'T DO THIS FOR OUR STUDENTS OUR STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE PENALIZED IN THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RECEIVE THE FINANCIAL AID THAT THEY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO -- THE THE FINAL COMMENTS -- ONE THE QUESTION WAS WHAT IS KEITA THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION -- WHICH IS BEEN IN PLACE FOR NEARLY A DECADE AND IT IS CALIFORNIA STATE FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION THAT ALLOWS UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS TO APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID LAST QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THE OPT OUT LOOK LIKE AND DOES THIS COVER MILITARY SERVICE ABSOLUTELY IT DOES COVER MILITARY SERVICE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR OTHER EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE TO OPT OUT OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS PARENTS AND ELEAZAR OF A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AS A STUDENT WHO IS EIGHTEEN YEARS OR OLDER MAY OPT OUT THROUGH A WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE ALLEY A OR AN ALLEY A COMPLY AGAIN EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE FOR STUDENTS WHO CANNOT COMPLETE THIS REQUIREMENT AND THUS OPT THEM OUT EXTENUATING EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES MAY INCLUDE MILITARY PLANS FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS ENTERING
