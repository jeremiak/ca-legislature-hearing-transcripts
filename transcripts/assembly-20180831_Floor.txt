THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS SP ONE SIXTY EIGHT HAS ONE SIMPLE BUT CRITICAL OBJECTIVE TO SUPPORT AND INCREASE RECYCLING MARKETS RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NATIONAL SOARED THE A A CHINESE. PROGRAM HAS RESULTED IN THE RECYCLING CRISIS AND A. STOCKPILING OF RECYCLABLE MATERIALS IT'S AB BUILDING UP ALL THROUGH OUR STATE. AND TO COMBAT THIS WE NEED. TO CREATE MARKETS FOR THESE MATERIAL SO ESPY'S. ONE SIXTY EIGHT DOES EXACTLY THAT BY CREATING A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM FOR PAT PLASTIC THAT DOES NOT EXIST TODAY. WITH THE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE WE ARE GIVING THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY A SIGNAL THAT IN -- OVER FIFTEEN MONTHS BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS MUST INCORPORATE. AT LEAST 20% RECYCLED MATERIAL IN THEIR PLASTIC BOTTLES THAT ARE FOR SALE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD LIKE TO CLEAR PASSED SOME OF MISINFORMATION THAT'S BEEN CIRCULATING ABOUT THE BILL. OF THIS BILL APPLIES ONLY TO SEE R. V. CONTAINERS EXCEPT FOR ALUMINUM AND GLASS [inaudible] UP. TO EACH INDIVIDUAL CONTAINERS NOT REQUIRED TO MEET THE CONTENT STANDARD IT'S THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION THAT COMPLIANCE. BE BASED ON THE AVERAGE OF A COMPANY'S CONTAINERS. THE 20% ANNUAL MINIMUM CONTENT FOR PLASTIC CONTAINERS IS 1100% FEASIBLE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF BEVERAGES SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. HAVE ALREADY REPORTED AS HAVING SOME LEVEL OF RECYCLED CONTENT. AND THERE'S ENOUGH PET PLASTIC IN CALIFORNIA TO MEET THIS 20% STANDARD. CALIFORNIA IS PROJECTED TO HAVE MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH CLEAN CLEAR FOOD GRADE OUR PET THEN. RECYCLABLE PET THEN WOULD BE NEEDED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS LEGISLATION. THE ELIMINATION OF OVERSEAS MARKETS HAS CREATED AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF RECYCLABLE PET. THAT IS AVAILABLE AND IT'S DEMAND. AND THAT WAS WHY S. B. ONE SIXTY EIGHT IS SO CRITICAL. OUR CHOICE IS CLEAR WE CAN HAVE PLASTICS IN OUR LANDFILL. OF WHERE THEY WILL NEVER GO AWAY OR WE CAN DEVELOP A VIBRANT RECYCLING MARKET. RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND CREATE GOOD MANUFACTURING JOBS. S. B.

COCA COLA AND OTHERS THAT ARE. SEATING THE 20% -- RECYCLED CONTENT BUT THAT WE NEED TO ESTABLISH A BASELINE SO THAT THE WE WE CAN NOW -- ADDRESS THIS CRISIS THAT IS THE NATIONAL SORT POLICY WHERE CHINA HAS REFUSED TO TAKE ANY -- MORE RECYCLED PLASTIC FROM OUR COUNTRY AND SO THIS IS A VERY NECESSARY BILL IN ORDER -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WHENEVER WE PUT PLASTICS AND RECYCLING BINS WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE RECYCLED. THANK YOU MISS MURATSUCHI SAYING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. ON THE ITEM THIS ROOMY MAY CLOSE WE WISH THANK YOU AGAIN AND I'M ITS FIRST MISTER SPEAKER AND THANK YOU MEMBERS STUFF FOR YOUR COMMENTS ON THIS BILL.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER GOOD MORNING MEMBERS WHEN THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTER KILLED FIFTY EIGHT AND INJURED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE. IN THE DEADLIEST MASS SHOOTING IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY HE FIRED MORE THAN ELEVEN HUNDRED ROUNDS IN MERE MINUTES. HE DID THIS USING A DEVICE KNOWN AS A MULTI BURST TRIGGER ACTIVATOR WHICH EFFECTIVELY TRANSFORMED HIS SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLE INTO A MACHINE GUN. UNFORTUNATELY MULTI BURST TRIGGER ACTIVATORS ARE LEGAL IN MANY STATES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY SIX LIST COMMON NAMES FOR THESE FIREARMS ATTACHMENTS WHICH INCLUDE BOMB STOCK DOUBT CRANK AND TRIGGER ACTUATOR. BY LISTING THEPOPULAR NAMES OF THESE DEVICES SP THIRTEEN FORTY SIX MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THE FIREARMS ENTHUSIASTS WILL BE MADE AWARE THAT SUCH DEVICES ARE ILLEGAL IN OUR STATE. THE BILL ALSO DESCRIBES VARIOUS DESIGNS FOR MULTI BURST TRIGGER ACTIVATORS AND MAKES CLEAR THAT IF SUCH DEVICES BUILT INTO OR USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A FIREARM. IT IS WITHIN THE STATUTE AND ILLEGAL. S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY SIX WILL DECREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THESE DEVICES BEING BROUGHT INTO CALIFORNIA AND THUS REDUCE THE CHANCES OF A TRAGEDY LIKE THE ONE THAT OCCURRED IN LAS VEGAS. THIS BILL HELPS STRENGTHEN OUR LAWS IN THE CHURCH THE BOTH GUN MERCHANTS AND OWNERS ARE UNMISTAKABLY PUT ON NOTICE THAT THESE DEVICES ARE LEGAL TO POSSESS OR SELL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS THIS BILL HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. I THINK IT WAS GABRIEL MUCH MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. A FIREARM IS SIMPLY A TOOL. IN A FOR ACTUALLY GOING TO STOP MASS MURDERERS AND DO THESE THINGS WE NEED TO DO MORE ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE. WE NEED TO STOP BLAMING FIREARMS WE NEED TO STOP SAYING BUT STOCKS AND EVERYTHING ELSE OR THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL. AND WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT THESE ARE SIMPLY TOOLS. THAT IT'S THE HUMAN BEHIND THE TOOL. THAT IS RESPONSIBLE THE SAME WAY AS IS NOT THE CAR'S FAULT FOR DRUNK DRIVER. ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU MR MATHIS DOCTOR CHOI YOU'RE RECOMMENDS. THANK YOU SPEAKER I RISE SITE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS A BIT A LOT S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY SIX SAW THIS BILL IS NOT A YA SOLUTION IN SEARCH FOR A PROPER. IT WORKED REPRESENTS ARE. JUST A AND NO THOUGH IS STONE MONTH NOT IN THIS OUR BODY IS SO ONGOING AFFLUENT. TO DISMANTLE THE A SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS ALL OF OUR LAW ABIDING CALIFORNIA CITIZENS. SOME INCOME ARE IN SACRAMENTO LOOSELY BY. IN THE QUEST TO LAW RESTRICTING THE RIGHTS ARE OVERALL ABIDING GUN OWNERS. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO OUR DEMANDS ON A SOFT ON CRIME RAFTO OWN MANAGERS [inaudible] OF MEASURES. THIS BILL LISTA UNNECESSARY. AND A DOZEN NOTHING [inaudible] SO ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF A GUN VIOLENCE. BY YEAH PREMIUM ON STOCKS TRUST ME. THEY WILL ALWAYS I HAVE WELL WHATEVER GUN THEY WANT. TO DO WITH THEIR WORK. I ASK MY COLLEAGUES DOCTORS JOIN ME. IN OPPOSING SPF. THIRTEEN FORTY SIX MISTER BERMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT. OF SB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX I AGREE. WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM BY THEY'LL YOU THAT WE NEED TO DO A LOT MORE. ON MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. STOP PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS FROM GETTING GUNS. THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE CASE -- IN THE VEGAS SHOOTING. WHICH ITS HOME A LITTLE BIT FOR ME BECAUSE WHEN THE VEGAS SHOOTER. I'M LEASE HOLY HELL. ON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AT A CONCERT THAT DAY. ARE THAT NIGHT THE NIGHT IT WAS JASON ALL DEAN -- WAS WAS ON STAGE. THE NIGHT BEFORE. I WAS AT ADJACENT CONCERT WITH MY GIRLFRIEND -- SING AND DANCING AND AND HAVING A GOOD TIME -- TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE IT'S RUNNING OF A THEATER IN MOUNTAIN VIEW. AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE -- THE THE IMPACT IF SOMEBODY WHERE IT WOULD'VE STARTED FIRING. OVER A THOUSAND ROUNDS -- INTO A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO WERE LITTLE IT LITERALLY TAKE. THEY'RE AT A CONCERT SURROUNDED BY FENCES. A CAGED IN. AND SOMEBODY WHO IS ABLE TO USE A BOMB STOCK. TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT. FAR MORE BULLETS PER MINUTE THAN ANYBODY EVER NEEDS TO OUTSIDE OF WAR -- TO DETAIN FLICK THE AND IT IMMENSE DAMAGE -- THAT THAT PERSON INFLICTED SO. THIS IDEA THAT -- YOU KNOW WE DON'T ELIMINATE CARS -- YOU KNOW THAT BACK THERE THAT BECAUSE CAR ACCIDENTS WE DON'T. BOARD PUT SPEED LIMITS ON THE ROAD. AND THIS IS AN ELIMINATING A GUN. IT'S OF RESTRICTING THE ABILITY OF SOMEBODY TO BE ABLE TO TOTALLY UNNECESSARILY FIRE. THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS IN IN AND I AM. INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME SPAN SO YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO HUNT. THAT'S COOL BUT IF YOU NEED ISSUED A HUNDRED ROUNDS IN A MINUTE TO HUNT [inaudible] YOU'RE USELESS -- SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH YOU. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS ALLOWS YOU TO DO. AND SO I FULLY ENCOURAGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT SB BECAUSE YOU'RE MATHIS STATE YOUR POINT OF ORDER -- TO DO WITH THE RIGHT OF HAUNTING IT HAD TO DO WITH THE RIDE OF CITIZENS BEING ABLE TO WRITE THEMSELVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S THAT. THIS IS A PULITZER MATHIS THE POINT OF ORDERS NOW ALL TAKEN POINT ORDERS NOT OPPORTUNITY. TO EXTEND DEBATE IT'S TO ISSUE A POINT OF ORDER THAT I'M ABLE TO RULE ON I MEAN TO SAY THAT POINT OF ORDER IS NOT WELL TAKEN MISTER. BERMAN IS. RIGHT JUST ON THE MATTERS I HAVE ABOUT THANK YOU THANK YOU DOWSING CLARIFIES. THAT A POINT OF ORDER IS REALLY STRICTLY ON THE RULES. THAT THIS BODY IS ABIDING BY. SO THAT'S OUT OF ORDER -- MISTER BERMAN HAS CLOSED DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. ON THIS MATTER. SEEING AND HEARING NONE. MR GABRIEL YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- I JUST SAY I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM IRVINE DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS -- IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM I THINK THAT MASS SHOOTINGS ARE PROBLEM OUR SOCIETY. I SUSPECT THAT IF MY COLLEAGUE WENT KNAUS MOST PARENTS IN HIS COMMUNITY IF THEY THOUGHT THAT MASS SHOOTINGS OR PROBLEM. THEY WOULD AGREE THAT THEY ARE PROBLEM AND I THINK WHAT'S FRUSTRATING FOR A LOT OF US IS THAT EVERY TIME THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH IS A REASONABLE MODEST COMMONSENSE MEASURE. ON THE ISSUE OF GUNS THERE SO MUCH PUSH BACK AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY. THIS IS NOT A MEASURE TO TAKE FOLKS GUNS AWAY. MULTI BURST TRIGGER ACTIVATORS ARE ALREADY ILLEGAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS SIMPLY CLARIFIES OUR LAW MAKE SURE AND THAT FOLKS ARE AWARE THAT THESE THINGS ARE LEGAL UNDER STATE LAW MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN BE USED IN A WAYS THAT ARE LEGAL UNDER STATE LAW. AND REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THESE DEVICES WHICH ARE ALREADY ILLEGAL UNDER STATE LAW WILL BE BROUGHT INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS A REASONABLE COMMON SENSE MEASURE IT HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. THINGS GABRIEL WITHOUT THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE I'M. THIS ARTICLE AT ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF THOUGH. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE ALL MEMBERS THAT IS OUT OF THE CLARK WELL. CLOSE YOUR ALL TALLY THE VOTE ICE FORTY THREE KNOWS. TWELVE THE MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO JUMP AHEAD. IN THE FILE ORDER. TAKE UP FILE ITEM NUMBER SIXTY THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER. SIXTY S. B. [inaudible] TWELVE SEVENTY NINE CORPORATE. SENATE BILL TWELVE SEVENTY NINE BY SENATOR BRADFORD AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO SENTENCING. IT'S YOU'RE DAVID CHIU. THANK MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES ARE RISING BEHALF OF SENATOR BRADFORD TO PRESENT SP TWELVE SEVENTY NINE A BILL TO SIMPLIFY CALIFORNIA'S COMPLEX SENTENCING LAWS AND ENSURE. GREATER PROPORTIONALITY IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. UNDER EXISTING LAW OUR STATE HAS ONE OF THE MOST CONFUSING SENTENCING STRUCTURES IN THE WORLD. SO INDICATE THAT SO INTRICATE THAT JUDGES PROSECUTORS AND PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE OFTEN UNCERTAIN WITH THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN VARIOUS SENTENCING SCHEMES. TO ADD TO THE PROBLEM OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY. INCLUDING OVER FOUR HUNDRED SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS ON OUR BOOKS. AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR I HAVE SEEN THE IMPACT OF THE WAR ON DRUGS THE TOUGH ON CRIME APPROACHES TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE. THIS IS RESULTED OFTEN IN A CYCLE OF CRIME AMONG DISADVANTAGED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WHAT THIS BILL IS A SMALL CHANGE IN A LARGER SYSTEM WHICH SEEKS TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS BY RESTORING SENTENCING PROPORTIONALITY AND PREVENTING INDIVIDUALS FROM SERVING MORE TIME? FOR AN ENHANCEMENT THEN THE UNDERLYING CRIME ITSELF. ULTIMATELY THIS BILL WOULD HELP TO REFINE ARE CONFUSING SENTENCING LAWS BY INSURING THAT A FULL TERM OF IMPRISONMENT DOES NOT EXCEED TWICE A NUMBER OF YEARS FOR THE BASE TERM. IT'S A MEASURED AND CAREFULLY CRAFTED BILL THAT DOES NOT ELIMINATE ANY ENHANCEMENTS AND DOES NOT INCLUDE A HOST OF OFFENSES THAT ARE NO SERIOUS VIOLENT. IN NATURE AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISS YOU. MISS BAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE. VERY STRONG OPPOSITION NOT BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A SIMPLE. AND WHAT WE SEE HERE PROPORTIONAL [inaudible] CRIMINAL CODE. BUT BECAUSE PASSING THIS LAW. IS GONNA MAKE LIFE VERY ON SIMPLE AND DISPROPORTIONATE FOR THE VICTIMS LITTERED DESPERATELY UNDERSERVED BY THE US. THIS GIVES A VOLUME DISCOUNT TO CRIMINALS. SO LONG AS THEY GET CENTS FOR ABOUT FOR THE CRIMES OF THEIR CHARGE FOR HAVE FOR VICTIMS YOU CAN HAVE VICTIM AFTER VICTIM AFTER VICTIM. WHO IS COMPLETELY THROWN ASIDE BY THE US? AND IT ALSO INCLUDES SOME OF THE GROSSEST MOST SEVERE CRIMES ON CHILDREN. LET'S TAKE A FEW EXAMPLES. LARRY NASSER HAD OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY VICTIMS MANY CALIFORNIANS. MANY THE AGE OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN THEY ARE COMPLETELY DISREGARDED BY THIS BILL. YOU ONLY HAVE TO SERVE IF YOU WERE HERE AND UNDER THIS BILL HE'D ONLY BE CENTS FOR FOUR OF THOSE VICTIMS WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO THE FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS. THE OTHER HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THAT WERE VICTIMIZED BY LARRY NASSER. YOU'RE SAYING I'D RATHER HAVE A SIMPLE CODE IN THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT. THEY ALSO WOULD NOT BE PROTECTED BECAUSE THIS DOESN'T COVER. NON FORCIBLE SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A MINOR. ONLY FORCIBLE SEXUAL ASSAULT. A MINOR IS COVERED BY THIS. SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO THOSE VICTIMS OF NON FORCIBLE SEXUAL ASSAULT I'M SORRY THAT'S JUST. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE THINK THE CRIMINAL SHOULD HAVE TO SERVE MORE TIME. FOR WE TALKED A LOT IN THIS FLOOR ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AGAIN THE FASTEST GROWING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE IN THE UNITED STATES AND A SEVERE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY FEWER BILLS ON THIS FLORA COME HERE AND GET PAST TO FIGHT HUMAN TRAFFICKING THIS IS ONE WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT. EASIER FOR THE PEOPLE WHO PERPETRATED HUMAN TRAFFICKING ON MORE THAN SIX VICTIMS. TO BE SENTENCED. FOR I JUST GIVEN EXAMPLE THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION MAKES VERY CLEAR. YOU HAVE SIX VICTIMS A JUDGE CAN CURRENTLY [inaudible] IMPOSE. A HIGHER SENSE OF EIGHTEEN YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS UNDER THIS BILL THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME THEY'RE GONNA SEE FOR THE BASED TERM IS GOING TO BE 50% OF THAT. SO THE CRIMINALS GET FREE VICTIMS [inaudible] FREE VICTIMS. THEY'LL GET CENTS FOR A FEW THE CRIMES AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT THESE ARE CONSTITUENTS. OR SOME OF THE WORST GROSSEST CRIMES THEY'RE NOT ONLY BEING LET OFF THE HOOK. THEY'RE NOT CARING FOR THE VICTIMS. GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE ROBBERY. YOU COMMIT A ROBBERY AND USE A FIREARM AND YOU JUST CHARGE IT AND IT CAUSES GREAT BODILY HARM. DOESN'T MATTER. UNDER THIS THAT ENHANCEMENT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE. AND WE JUST HAD A BILL ACTUALLY GREAT DOLLARS CO AUTHOR OF IT. I'M ON BOND STOCKS. AND EVERYONE HERE SPOKE IN FAVOR OF MAKING SURE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS AND CALIFORNIANS FROM GUN VIOLENCE. THIS BILL IS SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN WE WANT A SIMPLE PROPORTIONAL CODE AND IT DOESN'T MATTER TO US THAT YOU USED A FIREARM IN THE COURSE OF A ROBBERY AND CAUSE GREAT BODILY INJURY. WE HAVE DONE ENOUGH THIS LEGISLATURE TO BE LIGHTS ON CRIME IT'S START IT'S TIME TO START CARING FOR THE VICTIMS IN THIS STATE. AND HOLDING PEOPLE WHO COMMIT CRIME RESPONSIBLE FOR IT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. MS CARILLO. YOUR RECOGNIZE. SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE AS A PROD CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE S. B.. TWENTY SB. TWELVE SEVENTY NINE FOR DECADES THE TOUGH ON CRIME ERA THOUGHT POLICIES ENACTED THAT EXTENDED PRISON SENTENCES AND INCARCERATED THOUSANDS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR. THESE TACTICS REMOVE FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND KEPT MANY BEHIND BARS FOR FAR LONGER THAN THEY DESERVED. EXTENDED SENTENCES DO NOT LEAD TO A DECREASE IN CRIME OR IMPROVE OUR PUBLIC SAFETY WE SHOULD ROOT OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ACTUALLY MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER AND PRIORITIZE. THEIR FAIR STANDARDS IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. S. B. TWELVE SEVENTY NINE ENSURE THAT JUDGES OVERSEE EFFECTIVE SENTENCES THAT IT'S BASED ON CLEAR. AND LOGICAL STANDARDS AND I WANNA JUST PERSONALLY BRING UP A POINT THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM DUBLIN JUST STATED IN TERMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS. THIS BODY DEBATED YESTERDAY INCARCERATING. TWELVE YEAR OLDS. IT DEBATED INCARCERATING YOUNG PEOPLE. AND TRYING THEM AS ADULTS WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WHEN A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SHARES A CELLBLOCK. WITH A FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD. MORE THAN HALF OF YOUNG PEOPLE. THAT ARE THROWN IN PRISON WITH ADULTS. ARE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT INSIDE THE PRISON SYSTEM. SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT VICTIMS AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE ON ONE QUE ON ONE HAND AND THEN. TALK ABOUT THE VERY DIFFERENTLY ON THE OTHER HAND. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CORRECT MANY OF THE WRONGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING FOR MANY DECADES. THIS BILL. IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO REDEFINE CALIFORNIA'S COMPLICATED SENTENCING APPROACH AND REAFFIRMING OUR COMMITMENT TO A FAIR AND EFFECTIVE. JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- FIRST LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I WANT TO CLEAR ONE THING UP CHILDREN DO NOT GET SENT TO PRISON WITH ADULTS. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN SO LET'S JUST DISPENSED WITH THAT BALD HEAD SECOND OF ALL NO VICTIM I DON'T THINK VICTIMS. WHEN THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THE CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED AGAINST THEM? WHEN YOU'RE THINK WHEN THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THE CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST THEM I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT WHAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST IN THEIR MIND IS THE RACE? OF THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE CRIMES TO BRING RACE INTO IT IS INSULTING IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COLOR YOU ARE WHEN YOU COMMIT THE CRIME OR WHAT COLOR THE VICTIM IS. I THINK THAT NEEDS TO JUST BE OUT OF THE CONVERSATION -- THE ARGUMENTS FOR THIS BILL SUGGESTS THAT. THE SENTENCING LAWS THEY'RE JUST TOO CONFUSING. SO I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT ANYBODY WHO IS AN ATTORNEY A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY OR ANYBODY WHO SUGGESTING THAT OUR CRIMINAL SENTENCING LAWS ARE TOO CONFUSING. PERHAPS THEY MIGHT WANT TO CHOOSE ANOTHER PROFESSION ONE THAT'S A LITTLE MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD BY THEM. BECAUSE THERE IS NO MISUNDERSTANDING WHEN IT COMES TO CRIMES THAT ARE COMMITTED AGAINST CHILDREN. AND FOR THE LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORTH IN THIS BODY PARTICULARLY RELATING TO CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN ARE SEXUAL CRIMES. YOU ARE SUGGESTING WITH THIS BILL THAT -- PRIESTS WHO MOLEST CHILDREN. SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY SHE GET A BUY ONE GET ONE FREE IN THIS CASE IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE WAS CORRECT IN STATING THAT WE HAVE PASSED QUITE ENOUGH. SOFT ON CRIME [inaudible] PRUE. CRIMINAL BILLS THIS YEAR ALONE. THEN I THINK IT'S ENOUGH THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING DO NOT BE ENTICED BY THE SIREN SONG OF THIS IS ABOUT RACE. AND NO THIS IS ONLY ABOUT RACE. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. STOP RACE BAITING AND TALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUE IN MAYBE FOR ONE SOMEBODY HERE. CAN TALK ABOUT THE VICTIMS HOW ABOUT THAT. HIS VICTIMS HAVE A VOICE TO AND NEVER TO EVER HEAR ANYONE TALK ABOUT THE VICTIMS WHO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SOME BILL LIKE THIS WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION SPEAK ABOUT IT THANKFULLY. BUT IF YOUR HEART IS SO FULL OF COMPASSION. THEN SURELY THERE CAN BE SOME ROOM IN THERE FOR SOME COMPASSION FOR THE VICTIMS I URGE A NO VOTE [inaudible] MISTER MURATSUCHI [inaudible] URANUS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] MEMBERS. I UNDERSTAND AND I RESPECT WAS CENTER BRADFORD IS TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL. AND I THINK. WE ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE PASSED SEVERAL MEASURES. TO SWING THE PENDULUM BACK FROM WAR WE WERE IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. WHEN WE WENT TOO FAR? WHEN WE OVER INCARCERATED ESPECIALLY. PEOPLE FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND SO I UNDERSTAND THE GOAL AND THE INTENT. THE GOOD INTENTIONS OF MANY OF THE BILLS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE US. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS BUT THIS. IS A BAD BILL. DOCTOR LARRY NASSER. WE TALKED ABOUT HIM. THE MEMBER FROM DUBLIN. TALKS ABOUT DOCTOR NASSER A CONVICTED CHILD MOLESTER WHO WAS A USA GYMNASTICS NATIONAL TEAM DOCTOR MOLESTED OVER ONE HUNDRED YOUNG GIRLS MANY OF WHOM WERE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OLD HAD. DOCTOR NASSER BIN PROSECUTE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNDER THIS BILL. THE JUDGE WOULD BE TAPPED. HE WOULD HAVE NO DISCRETION TO SENTENCE HIM. TO ANYTHING MORE THAN SIX YEARS TOTAL. FOR MOLESTING OVER ONE HUNDRED YOUNG GIRLS. SO IF ANYTHING ELSE. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL BILLS COME BEFORE THIS BODY THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO GIVEJUDGES THE DISCRETION [inaudible] TO STRIKE. ENHANCEMENTS ARE TO STRIKE PRIOR CONVICTIONS. THIS IS TAKING AWAY FROM THAT DISCRETION. THIS IS TAKING US AWAY FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE WHICH IS LET THE PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DOCTOR NASSER MOLESTING OVER A HUNDRED YOUNG GIRLS. AND IT JUST BE CAPPED UNDER THIS BILL TO NO MORE THAN SIX YEARS IN PRISON. STRONGLY URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. MR CUTTING HIM URANUS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. JUST WANNA TOUCH ON ONE ASPECT THAT HASN'T BEEN ADDRESSED I THINK IN SOME OF THE VERY ELOQUENT. SPEECHES AGAINST THIS. VERY BAD IDEA -- AND THAT'S THAT IS THIS. LOOK I SUPPORT THE SECOND AMENDMENT BUT IF YOU USE A FIREARM IN THE COMMISSION OF A ROBBERY OR HOME INVASION. YOU NEED TO DO SOME PRISON TIME. THAT IS AN INHERENTLY DANGEROUS ACTIVITY IN MY CAREER I'VE WORKED ON CASES WHERE SOMEBODY BROUGHT A GUN IN TWO MARIJUANA RIPOFF. AND THE GUY. THE VICTIM THAT WAS SITTIN THERE SELLING MARIJUANA OUT OF HIS HOUSE HAD A GUN UNDER IT. UNDER A BED. AND HE PULLED THE GUN TO PROTECT HIMSELF. AND SOMEBODY DOT. I WORKED ON A CASE WHERE TWO GUYS HEARD KNOCKING OVER CONVENIENCE STORES. STICKING GUNS ON THE FACE OF SOME POOR CLERK IN A SEVEN ELEVEN WHO'S JUST TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING. HAS A GUN STUCK IN HER FACE AND THEY DEMAND SHE CLEANS UP THE CASH. SHE WASN'T DOING IT FAST ENOUGH AND THEY SHOT HER IN THE FACE. MIRACULOUSLY THAT LADY SURVIVE BOY HITTER CHEN WENT OUT THE SIDE OF HER FACE AND SHE SURVIVED TESTIFIED AGAINST THEM BUT LOOK IF YOU BRING A FIREARM. IN THE COMMISSION OF A ROBBERY OR A STRING OF ROBBERIES. AND YOU WAVE A GUN IN SOMEBODY'S FACE YOU'RE ENDANGERING THAT PERSON YOURSELF AND EVERYONE AROUND YOU. AND IF YOU GET CONVICTED OF THAT AFTER YOUR DUE PROCESS AND YOU'RE RIGHT TO TRIAL. THEN I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE PUTTING A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF YEARS YOU NEED TO GO AWAY. I THINK WE SHOULD BE LEADING A JUDGE DECIDE THE NUMBER OF YEARS YOU NEED TO GO AWAY [inaudible] TO PRISON I KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE. PLEASE VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM. SEEM KNOW ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE ITEM. CHIU YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER ARMPIT COLLEAGUES I DO APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND OBVIOUSLY WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION OF NOT JUST. HOW ARE WE TOUGH ON CRIME ARE SOFT ON CRIME BUT HOW DO WE BECOME SMARTER CRIME IS A STATE OF CALIFORNIA? IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND FELONY SENTENCING LAWS. OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS STATUTES CASE LAWS RULES OF COURT CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT NOT JUST FOR CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS. BUT FOR PROSECUTORS FOR JUDGES FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE ALSO BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO AVOID PUNISHMENT IT'S STILL SIGNIFICANTLY HOLDS PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CRIMES THEY COMMIT. AND CONTRARY TO SOME OF I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HEARD TODAY. I AND SOME OF WHAT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED BY THE OPPOSITION IT DOES NOT PUT A CAP ON SENTENCES FOR MURDER. AND FOR THE MOST SERIOUS SEXUAL OFFENSES INCLUDING SEX OFFENSES AGAINST CHILDREN. FOR EXAMPLE RAPE SODOMY LEWD AND LASCIVIOUS ACTS ON A CHILD CONTINUOUS SEXUAL ABUSE OF A CHILD ORAL COPULATION. I CAN GO ON AND ON BUT THIS BILL WILL NOT APPLY TO THOSE OFFENSES. COLLEAGUES UNTIL WE CAN PROVE. THAT IF WE HAVE SENTENCES THAT ARE MANY MANY TIMES MORE THAN THE BASE TERM OF WHAT SOMEONE'S BEEN CHARGED WITH UNTIL WE CAN PROVE THAT THAT IS TRULY A DETERRENCE. A CRIME THAT THAT ACTUALLY INCREASES PUBLIC SAFETY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD SMARTER POLICY CHOICES. TO HELP ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME AND TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS TRULY SAFE FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY. PARTICULARLY OUR CHILDREN AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE.

AND IT ALSO WOULD HAVE A FACT ON AFTER SCHOOL SPORTS IT WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON A STUDENTS COMING HOME LATER IN THE DAY SO AS MUCH AS I DO BELIEVE THE RESEARCH. I DO HAVE TO OPPOSE SECOND THING THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUES IS THAT WE HAVE STUDENTS AND CHILDREN AND FAMILIES STAYING UP LATER AND LATER AND LATER BECAUSE THEY ARE OUT USING TECHNOLOGY TO FALL ASLEEP. AND SO THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT PARENTS HAVE TO BE IN CHARGE OF AND GETTING TO THERE'S THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL SOMETIMES A THREE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS THEIR KIDS GO. TO THIS COULD BE A VERY VERY -- DIFFICULT PROCESS FOR PARENTS TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND LESS WE HAVE ALL OUR BUSINESSES ALIGNED AND SO FORTH SO I REGRET. THAT THAT I OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. NOW SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I'M YOU KNOW WE'VE SAT HERE AND I AND I THINK THROUGHOUT MY TIME IN THIS LEGISLATURE I ONCE SAT ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE THERE A LOT OF THINGS TO COME FORWARD AND WE DEBATE. WHAT'S RIGHT FOR CHILDREN YOU KNOW IS THIS TESTING RIDE IS THE WAY WE'RE DOING THIS CURRICULUM RIGHT AND THERE'S USUALLY DEBATE ON EITHER SIDE OF THOSE. WERE PRESENTED HERE TODAY WITH THE SITUATION WITH NO DEBATE EVEN THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED. WILL SAY THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR. TEENAGERS DO BETTER IF THEY START LATER. WE KNOW IT'S BETTER FOR OUR CHILDREN. INSERT THE END OF THE DAY IS A MOTHER. WITH THREE KIDS AT TWO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS I UNDERSTAND IT'S A STRUGGLE. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT BY MY OPPONENTS. TO THE BILL WHO TALK ABOUT THE THE WORK HOURS AND HOW THIS IS INCONVENIENT FOR WORKING FAMILIES. AND I FIND THAT AN INTERESTING ARGUMENT BECAUSE REALLY ALL SCHOOL HOURS CAN BE INCONVENIENT FOR WORKING FAMILIES I COME FROM A DISTRICT WHERE WE HAVE A LARGE POPULATION. OF JANITORS WHO WORK TILL TWO THIRTY IN THE MORNING OFTEN THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. AND THEN HAVE TO WAKE UP AT A CERTAIN TIME TO TAKE THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL. BID UP THE WORK HOURS ARE NOT. STANDARD FOR AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF PARENTS RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THERE AREN'T A LOT OF NINE TO FIVE JOBS. IN SO WELL I UNDERSTAND IN A TRADITIONAL FAMILY SITUATION WHERE TWO PARENTS MAY BE ARE WORKING NINE TO FIVE THAT THAT THOSE START TIME IN THAT SPECIFIC COMMUNITY MAY WORK FOR THEM. IT'S NOT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE KIDS. IT'S NOT WHAT'S TRUE ACROSS ALL CALIFORNIA IF WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE WE DO TODAY. TO ACTUALLY VOTE EIGHT IT IN AND TO CAST A VOTE FOR A POLICY THAT WE KNOW IS SCIENTIFICALLY BACKED UP TO HELP OUR HIGH SCHOOL IN MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS. I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SOMEWHERE O'DONNELL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TO OPPOSE S. B.. THREE TWENTY EIGHT SURPRISE FOR MANY REASONS. OUR NUMBER ONE IS WE SHOULD NOT MICROMANAGE SCHOOLS FROM SACRAMENTO. REALLY WHY HAVE A SCHOOL DISTRICT EVER GOING TO PASS THIS BILL. S. B. THREE TWENTY EIGHT WILL BURDEN WORKING FAMILIES AS NOT EVERY HOME HAS A STAY AT HOME PARENT. OR A PARENT THAT CAN SET THEIR OWN SCHEDULE TO MONITOR THEIR CHILDREN AS THEY GO TO SCHOOL. LATER. S. B. THREE TWENTY EIGHT WILL EXPLODE BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. DISTRICTS WILL HAVE TO BUY MORE BUSES HIRE MORE STAFF TO FIT THE KIDS IN A IN A MUCH TIGHTER WINDOW. SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT WILL LIMIT STUDENT LEARNING AND ACTIVITIES. NO LONGER CAN A SCHOOL HAVE A CLASS THAT STARTS BEFORE EIGHT THIRTY THIS BILL IS A MISTAKE LET'S PUT IT TO BED. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT WHEN I JOIN MY COLLEAGUES -- WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE IN TEACHING IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- WE WE VOTED AGAINST THIS BILL LAST YEAR I DON'T THINK THE BILL IS CHANGE MUCH. AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE. THAT ED IN THE WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION. THE FARTHER AWAY THE DECISIONS ARE MADE FROM THE CLASSROOM. THE WORST THOSE DECISIONS ARE. IT IS VERY CLEAR IN EDUCATION THAT ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL. WHY PUT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE SAME POSITION? I SUGGEST TO VOTE NO ON S. B.. THREE TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE TWENTY EIGHT I WORKED AT ONE TIME A UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH HAD FORTY ONE SCHOOLS. AND THE HAD STAGGERED START TIME SO MY OFFICIAL TIME I WOULD THINK I CONSIDERED A LATE SCHOOL MY OFFICIAL TIME WAS AT EIGHT FORTY FIVE KIDS CAME IN AT EIGHT FORTY FIVE AND IT WORKS IN FONTANA. AND THEY STAGGERED THAT START TIME SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN GET TO SCHOOL ON TIME AND IT WORKED I WORKED THERE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. AND IT WAS FINE PARENTS -- WERE ABLE TO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT. ANYTHING BUT THE KIDS AND WHEN WE START HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR KIDS THAT'S THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE IN. I APPRECIATE THAT WE ALL HAVE A BUSY LIVES AND WE HAVE DIFFERENCES IN -- RESPONSIBILITIES BIKED RESEARCH STATES THAT THIS IS GOOD FOR KIDS AND THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT S. B. THREE TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER YOU'RE WRECKING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I SERVED ON MY SCHOOL BOARD FOR OVER TWELVE YEARS BEFORE SERVING ON THE HUNTING CAN BE CITY COUNCIL BEFORE COMING HERE. AND I VERY MUCH VALUE THE ROLE OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LOOK LOCALLY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS LIKE THIS. AND A BIG PART OF THE REASON WHY THEY SHOULD MAKE DECISIONS LIKE THIS. IS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A VERY DIVERSE STATE WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT NEEDS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT INPUTS THAT SHOULD BE HEARD AND LISTEN TO AND GOING TO THE PROCESS OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS. THEY'RE JUST OVER THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT MANY OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY MUCH LARGER DISTRICTS IN URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS THAT DOES SERVE QUITE A FEW FOLKS. BUT AN AREA LIKE MINE. THERE COULD BE CONCERNS SUCH AS BEING ABLE COMEDY FOR SPORTS. THE TIMING NEEDED FOR THE COMEDY AT THE SURF TEAM I SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL JOBS AND OTHER THINGS. ARE BUT SAY THERE'S AN AFTER SCHOOL OR ON AFTER SCHOOL ISSUE OR ISSUES THERE RELATED ANYMORE AGRICULTURAL AREA -- WE'RE STUDENTS MAY BE MORE INVOLVED IN THE FARM. EACH OF US HAVE VERY DIFFERENT DISTRICTS WITH VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS. AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN SCHOOL MORE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN PARENTS TEACHERS AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE DECISION FOR WHAT IS THE RIGHT TIME TO BE ABLE TO START SCHOOL. THEY SHOULD BE A LOCAL DECISION FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE YOUR WRITTEN. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBER RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB. THREE TWENTY EIGHT I HAVE HAD CHILDREN IN HIGH SCHOOL FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS SO I HAVE A LOT OF PRACTICAL RECENT EXPERIENCE WITH THIS. AND WHERE I LIVE OUR FIRST BILL APPLY SCHOOL RINGS AT SIX FIFTY FIVE A. M.. AND THAT'S IF YOU DON'T HAVE ZERO PERIOD SO I'VE HAD FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WATCHING MY KIDS STUMBLE OUT OF BED AND TRYING TO GET TO SCHOOL AND I KNOW FIRST HAND THE EFFECT IT HAS ON THEM. BUT I WAS AMAZED WHEN I WORKED AT THE RESEARCH SURROUNDING THIS ISSUE IN THE RESEARCH SHOWS CONCLUSIVELY. THAT THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST COST EFFECTIVE THING WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES IN CALIFORNIA. THE RESEARCH IS VOLUMINOUS IT'S BEEN ACADEMICALLY VETTED AND NO ONE IS DISPUTING IT NO ONE IS DISPUTING IT. NOW I KNOW THE DIFFICULTIES THAT TAKING THIS ACTION WOULD CAUSE IN MY OWN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE IN OPPOSITION TO IT AND WHEN I ASKED THEM WHY. THEY SAY WELL WE WOULD HAVE TO REORGANIZE OUR BUS SCHEDULES WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A BUS AVAILABILITY AND WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH AFTER SCHOOL SPORTS SCHEDULING. AND THOSE ARE PROBLEMS THAT WE WOULD NEED HELP SOLVING WE DON'T HAVE THE HELP RIGHT NOW. BUT E WILL NEVER START SOLVING THOSE PROBLEMS. UNTIL WE AGREED TO WORK TOWARDS THE GOAL OF STARTING SCHOOL LATER IN THIS BILL IS THE WAY THAT WE DO THAT. LET ME SAY AGAIN THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST COST EFFECTIVE THING WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES IN CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S TIME WE TAKE THAT STEP. PLEASE VOTE YES. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM DIRECTLY. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. I RISE IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE ONE THOUSAND TWENTY SIX SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA. ONE THOUSAND TWENTY SIX RIGHT NOW THERE ARE TWO MILLION NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN HIGH SCHOOLERS AND MIDDLE SCHOOLERS. THIS AFFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE. SO AFFECTS A LOT OF KIDS A LOT OF TEACHERS. CENTER THE EFFECT ON THE TEACHERS THEY BARGAINED. AND A LOT OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY BARGAINED FOR CONTRACTS AND SPECIFY CERTAIN START TIME TO WHAT HAPPENS THEY ALL OF ALL THOSE GET THROWN OUT THE WINDOW. WE REALLY WOULD DO WE REVISIT ALL OF THOSE ISSUES. THE BUS SCHEDULE. THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR RURAL SKIP SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEING ABLE TO GET KIDS TO SCHOOL ON TIME. FOR WORKING PARENTS. I'M GONNA TWO PARENT WORKING FAMILY. WITH FOUR KIDS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SCHOOL. SO IT'S NOT ABOUT ME BUT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES OUT THERE. AND THEIR PARENTS TO HAVE TO OPEN UP THE STORAGE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK. TO BE IN COURT AT EIGHT THIRTY HAVE. TO OPEN UP THE THE MEDICAL PRACTICE. WORK AT THE HOSPITAL. AND THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF THINGS PARENTS HAVE TO DO. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS MANY PEOPLE OF EXPRESSES [inaudible] THIS IS. IF THERE IS A ONE ISSUE YOU WANT A LOCAL DISTRICT TO BE ABLE TO TAILOR. TO THE KIDS AND THE TEACHERS AND THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO REPRESENT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY WHAT TIME YOUR SCHOOL START. I RESPECTFULLY ASK I GET IT SLEEP IS GOOD I'VE GOT AN EIGHTH GRADER RIGHT NOW HOME. SLEEP IS GOOD I GUESS I GOT THAT. NO DEBATE THERE [inaudible] BUT MOVING THE START TIME BACK IS NOT NECESSARILY GONNA MEAN MORE SLEEP FOR EVERY KID. IT JUST DOESN'T. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOVA. IQ ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER -- I'M SURE EVERYONE HAS PROBABLY RECEIVED A LOT OF EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS ABOUT THIS BILL KNOWING THAT IT WAS COMING. IN THE RESEARCH IS VOLUMINOUS. ON THIS MATTER THAT IT IS BETTER FOR KIDS TO SLEEP IN A LATER TO GET MORE. SLEEP IN THE EVENINGS YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IS VOLUMINOUS AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS VOLUMINOUS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS TO SAY. THIS IS NOT YOUR DECISION TO MAKE THIS IS OUR DECISION TO MAKE AND YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO THE PARENTS IN YOUR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS I PUT THIS OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN MY DISTRICT. EVERY CD. I AM VERY SURPRISED AT HOW MANY FACEBOOK PAGES ARE OUT THERE BY THE WAY BUT EVERY CITY HAS A DIFFERENT FACEBOOK GROUP AND I PUT IT OUT ON ALL OF THEM I ASKING THEIR OPINION. I WOULD SAY ABOUT HALF SAID. THEY LIKE THE IDEA OF THE LATER START TIME BUT THEY DON'T WANT US IMPOSING IT ON THEM THEY WANTED TO BE A SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL DECISION THE OTHER HALF. SAID THAT IT DIDN'T WORK FOR THEIR SCHEDULES AND THAT SACRAMENTO OUGHT NOT BE DECIDING FOR EVERYONE AS A WHOLE. WHAT TIME KID SHOULD START SCHOOL? SO I THINK IF YOU'VE BEEN HEARING FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN OU'VE BEEN HEARING FROM YOUR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO THEM THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WERE SENT HERE TO DO. NOT DECIDE THAT WE KNOW BETTER. AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE DECISION FOR THEM AND NO ONE IS DISPUTING THE SCIENCE BUT IT'S NOT JUST SCIENCE THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING THESE ARE PEOPLE'S LIVES WE HAVE TO CONSIDER AS WELL THEIR SCHEDULES. AND WHAT IT DOES TO THE FAMILY -- YOU KNOW SITUATION IN THE ABILITY FOR PARENTS TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR KIDS TO AND FROM SCHOOL NOT EVERYBODY HAS SOMEONE WHO'S A STAY HOME MOM YOU CAN TAKE THEM BACK AND FORTH. NOT EVERYBODY'S PARENT WORKS TEN MINUTES AWAY THAT TO COMMUTE OTHER DISTRICTS OR THEY HAVE TO COMMUTE. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IN A RURAL AREA WHICH I KNOW PEARL COUNTIES WERE PULLED OUT OF THIS BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO DRIVE AN AWFUL LONG DISTANCE AND YOU'VE COMPLETELY UP ENDED. THEIR LIVES. SO I WOULD URGE AGAINST THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MORE RESEARCH MERCER TO YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO THANK SENATOR PORTANTINO FOR US. ALWAYS PUSHING THIS BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I I THINK WE HAVE A VERY HONEST AND IN A VERY -- REAL -- WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH THIS BECAUSE I I THINK WE'VE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SCIENCE IN AND AND A LOT OF STUDIES THAT SHOW ALL THE HEALTH BENEFITS. AND AND I HAVEN'T HEARD A SINGLE PERSON A DISPUTE THAT BUT YOU KNOW I I THINK THE COUNTER ARGUMENT. TO YOU KNOW. YEAH IT'S MY DISTRICT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE I HAVE ONE DISTRICT MAN HAND BEACH UNIFIED THAT'S VERY STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. BUT YOU KNOW THE OTHER DISTRICTS ARE STRONGLY AGAINST THE BILL AND THE REASON WHY IS IS WHAT THE YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT. WE NEED TO DEFER THIS TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FOR OUR SCHOOL BOARDS TO TO WORK THIS OUT I KNOW THAT THEIR PROBLEMS WITH THAT WITH THE SPORTS SCHEDULES AND AND AND YOU KNOW TRYING. TO OF ME STATEWIDE SOLUTION I I THINK THE REAL SOLUTION HERE AND I THINK CENTER PORTANTINO IS CONTRIBUTING YOU KNOW IS IS MAKING GOT MORE OF A DIFFERENCE THAN ANYONE IN AND AND MOVING THIS DEBATE FORWARD -- IS TO HAVE GROUPS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS AMONGST THEMSELVES TO HAVE THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. DISCUSS IT AMONG THEMSELVES AND THEN TO HAVE THEM BRING THE SOLUTION TO US RATHER THAN US IMPOSING A SOLUTION AND FOR THAT REASON I WANT TO EXPLAIN RESPECTFULLY CENTER PORTANTINO WHY I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SOME NUMBER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I BEEN CONFLICTED ON THIS BILL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME AND I'VE BEEN CONFLICTED ON THIS BILL FOR A LOT OF THE REASONS I THINK A LOT OF MEMBERS ARE CONFLICTED. ON THIS BILL IS THAT I'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF MY LOCALS -- THAT DO NOT SUPPORT IT AND THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO RAIN RETAIN A DOUBT WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THEIR RIGHT TO DICTATE WHAT THE START TIMES ARE FOR SCHOOLS. AND I RESPECT THAT BECAUSE I'M SOMEBODY WHO'S ALWAYS TRIED TO BE VERY ATTENTIVE AND LISTEN. TO WHAT MY LOCALS HAVE TO SAY BECAUSE THAT MATTERS TO ME AND HELPS ME MAKE BETTER DECISIONS AND I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT -- A LOT OF HYPOTHETICALS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF WE CHANGE SCHOOLS TART START TIMES -- BUT I'VE ALSO HEARD FROM SOME SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT THAT ARE IN SUPPORT -- AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE IN PARTICULAR A THREE YEARS AGO SIERRA VISTA MIDDLE SCHOOL. CHANGED ITS START TIME FROM SEVEN FIFTY AM TO EIGHT TWENTY FIVE PM. SINCE THAT CHANGE. THEY HAVE SEEN A DECREASE IN TARDY'S BY GREATER THAN 90%. CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM DROPPED TO JUST THREE POINT 8%. THE LOWEST RATE IN ANY SECONDARY SCHOOL AND THE HOSPITAL APPOINT THE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THEY HAVE ALSO ONE OF THE HIGHEST ATTENDANCE RATES IN THE DISTRICT AT 97%. AND BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE IN THEIR SEATS MORE THE SCHOOL HAS WITNESS ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT INCREASE IN SUSPENSIONS DECREASE. THIS BILL. I BELIEVE WILL ENSURE THAT MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS IN OUR STATE ARE ABLE TO READ. THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES THAT COME FROM THE START TIME BORN OUT OF SOUND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INTO THE SLEEP NEEDS OF ADOLESCENCE. ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THAT RURAL DISTRICTS ARE EXEMPT SO THOSE CONCERNS SHOULD BE NO AND VOID. THERE IS ALSO A THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION ON THIS BILL AND I THINK THAT THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH TIME TO GET BUS SCHEDULES IN CLASS SCHEDULES IN ORDER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. TODAY WHILE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL ON THE BASIS OF ITS SCIENCE. AND LONG TERM BENEFITS TO OUR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT I KNOW SOME MAJOR CONCERNS FOR THIS BODY TO EXAMINE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. FOR DISTRICTS LIKE MINE WITH WORKING FAMILIES THERE STILL REMAINS THE REALITY THAT CHILDREN WON'T BE GETTING DROPPED OFF AT SCHOOL AT LATER TIMES SIMPLY BECAUSE OUR PARENTS MUST LEAVE. EARLY FOR THEIR JOBS. THIS PUTS BURDENS ON THE CAMPUS IS TO BE OPEN OR TO HAVE SOME SORT OF SECURITY OR SUPERVISION IN THE MORNING BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS. AMONG OTHER CONCERNS. FURTHERMORE IN JUST ONE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. THEY'VE ADVISE ME THAT IT'LL COST OF APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO HAVE ENOUGH BUSES AND REROUTE. TO REROUTE AND TRANSPORT CHILDREN SAFELY. SCHOOL WITH THIS NEW START TIME. WITH NO STATE SUPPORT. THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARE HUGE TO CONSIDER AND MUST BE MITIGATED. IF WE IS THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT MAKE IT A POINT TO ASSIST AND SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS TO ADEQUATELY. IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WE WILL HURT SCHOOL AND STUDENT PERFORMANCE. RATHER THAN HELP IT. WHEN I WANT TO LISTEN ALSO TO THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE CALLED ME? WHY DID GOING TO COUNSELING GABBY AND IZZY WHO TELL ME THIS WOULD BE A GOOD THING? SO I URGE YOU THAT [inaudible] WE COMMIT. TRULY SUPPORTING OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS MOVING FORWARD TO ENSURE IMPLEMENTATION BOLSTERS. SO THAT WE CAN. JULIE HAVE SUCCESS FIRST STUDENTS AND NOT HINDER THEM AS WE AS WE IMPLEMENT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER EGGMAN YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. I THINK YOU MEADOW SPEAKER MEMBERS AND IT'S INTERESTING FOR ME ON SOME LEVEL CITY HERE ALLAH TALK ON THE FLOOR ABOUT THE DECADES OF EX OF A RESEARCH IN THE THE THE THE DATA CLEARLY SHOWS AND VOLUMINOUS RESEARCH TELLS US. A THAT'S AN ARGUMENT I MADE ABOUT THE OVERDOSE PREVENTION CENTERS. THERE HAVE THERE HIM THREE DECADES OF A RESEARCH OVERWHELMINGLY SHOWING SOMETHING -- BUT TO THREE YEARS TO GET A A ONE CITY PILOT. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO THIS FOR STATEWIDE CHANGE OF START TIMES -- THE BIGGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MY COMMUNITY IS A STOCKTON UNIFIED WITH OVER FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN IT -- AND THEY ALSO LOOKED AT THE LOOKS LIKE IT'S A WAY TO GO. AND THEY TRIED A PILOT FOR A YEAR. AND WAS AN ABJECT FAILURE. TRYING TO COORDINATE THE BUS SCHEDULES AND ARTISTS ARE GETTING WE HAVE BUSES WE THE CITY BUSES IN. GETTING KIDS AROUND -- SO WELL I THINK A BILL LIKE THIS THAT WOULD HAVE SAID. EVERY DISTRICT SHOULD MAYBE HAVE A HEARING ON THIS. TO LOOK AT WHAT WORKS FOR THEM. THAT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE TO ME BUT TO DO A STATEWIDE MANDATE ABOUT WHAT TIME SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO START. JUST SEEMS TO ME TO BE AN OVER REACH A AGAIN THE DATA CAN REALLY GUIDE US BUT IT'S UP TO US THAN TO CREATE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. THAT ALLOWS IT TO ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED. I RECOMMEND A NO VOTE THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I HAD DUBBED DECIDED I WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS AGAIN BECAUSE I TOLD YOU LAST YEAR. THAT THERE WAS PLENTY OF RESEARCH BUT THAT THIS BILL WILL BE KILLED BY IGNORANCE. AND IT WAS. A LET ME JUST SIMPLY SAY A COUPLE THINGS ONE YOU KNOW THE WORST SCHOOL BOARD MEETING I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. ABOUT START TIMES. YOU THOUGHT SOMEBODY HAD KILLED EVERYBODY'S CHILD STOLEN EVERY GRANDPARENT ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH BLOWN UP EVERY BUSINESS BECAUSE WE WERE CHANGING THE TIME THAT PEOPLE STARTED THE SCHOOL. EVERY PROBLEM YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW ABOUT KIDS BEING DROPPED OFF AT NOT BEING DROPPED OFF IN WHOSE HOME WHO'S NOT. EXIST IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING IN EARLY AND SOMEONE LADEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN IF SOMEONE TOLD COULD NOT DRIVE SO AND SO THE SCHOOL. THIS THAT ALL THOSE THINGS EXIST RIGHT NOW WE DO NOT HAVE A PERFECT SYSTEM OF SCHOOL STARTING AND STOPPING TO FIT EVERY PERSON'S AGENDA IN YOUR DISTRICT. AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WOULD DISTRICTS OFTEN DEBATE THIS ISSUE THEY ARE PARALYZED. BECAUSE THEY LISTEN TO EVERYBODY'S INDIVIDUAL ISSUE AND EVEN WHEN YOU GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT SOMEBODY ELSE STILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM IT'S TOO LATE IT'S TOO EARLY I GOTTA GO TO WORK HE'S GOT TO COME HOME. SOMEBODY AND PICK UP THE BABY SO MY GARDENS UP THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW SO LET'S STOP PRETENDING THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS PERFECT. IF YOU EVER SERVED ON A SCHOOL BOARD YOU KNOW IT IS MOST IMPERFECT IN TERMS OF THE START AND STOP TIME AND IS NOT BASED ON RESEARCH A DATA IT'S OFTEN BASED ON BUSES RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE STREET AND A HOST OF OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE. SO DON'T PRETEND THAT WHAT WE HAVE IS A WONDERFUL SYSTEM THAT WORKS IT DOES NOT. AND IF YOU WANT TO GO TO SEE HAVE THE NIGHTMARE GO TO SCHOOL BOARD MEETING WOULD YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE THE TIME TO SCHOOLS TO TRY TO MAKE IT FAIR FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LAID WHO NOW WANT EARLY. AND YOU WILL HAVE A NIGHTMARE AND A MIDNIGHT MEETING AS WE DID IN SAN DIEGO. SO I JUST WANT KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE IS NOT PERFECT. BUT THE LEASES HAVE SOME RESEARCH BEHIND IT. AND IT HAS BEEN MANY YEARS AND ALTHOUGH SCHOOL BOARD TWENTY YEARS AGO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME SUBJECT. FINALLY THIS YEAR SAN DIEGO IS GOING TO IMPLEMENT IT. BECAUSE WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING TO HELP KIDS AND WHEN THE DATA COMES BACK AND SAYS THIS WILL ACTUALLY HELP TO KEEP YOUR SCHOOLS HAVE THE KIDS IN SCHOOL HAVE BEEN DOING BETTER SO FORTH AND SO ON THEN YOU OUGHT TO AT LEAST LISTEN TO IT. AND THE REALITY IS WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THESE CONCERNS BECAUSE EVERYONE'S LIFE IS VERY COMPLEX WE DON'T JUST HAVE EVERYBODY GOING TO WORK AT THE SAME TIME COMING BACK THE SAME TIME. THE BUSES DON'T ALWAYS RUN THE SAME WAY ON EVERY COMMUNITY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN YOU CHANGE THEIR START TIME PEOPLE HAVE A FIT THEY SAID ALL DIAGRAM OF THE RUNWAY EVERYBODY'S GOAL SOME GO HAPPEN TO EVERYBODY? THEY ALL JUST. AND THEY SHOW UP AT SCHOOL ON TIME. THAT'S THE REALITY. SO IF YOU THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HELPS KIDS YOU SHOULD BOTH. FOR IF YOU THINK IT DOESN'T HELP KID YOU SHOULDN'T. BUT DON'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN A BASKET BASED ON GROWN FOLKS. WHAT THEY THINK IS CONVENIENT FOR THEM? AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BECAUSE WE WILL SOLVE AS PARENTS WE SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. ALL OF YOU HAVE. YOU GOT KIDS IN SCHOOL NOW MANY OF YOU WORKING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW LITTLE KIDS GO TO SCHOOL LATE. YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE WORKING A AND YOU'RE JUST AND YOU ADAPT IN THE SCHOOL MAKES THOSE THINGS HAPPEN. SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IS REALLY GOING TO MOVE THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA FORWARD. WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME THAT WE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME TALKING AT ALL PEOPLE AND THEIR NEEDS. AND VERY SUBTLE DO WE TALK ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND WHAT IS GOING TO REALLY HELP OUR KIDS GET FROM THE BOTTOM TO AT LEAST THE MIDDLE IF NOT THE TOP. IT THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS POINTED OUT BY RESEARCH WE NEED TO GRAB IT. AND I CAN TELL YOU TO TURN IT OVER TO THE SCHOOL BOARDS BAY WILL BE PARALYZED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SHOW UP. I TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY WENT FROM. EIGHT TO EIGHT THIRTY AND HOW SOME BY ANOTHER THE WORLD'S GONNA FALL APART IN THIRTY MINUTES. SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO IN THIS FOR THE RIGHT REASON. AND IF YOU BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO HELP OUR KIDS WE HAVE TO LEAD AND MANY OF OUR PORTS WILL BE HAPPY BECAUSE EVEN THEY WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE HEAT. THAT'S ALL THAT WAS DONE BY THOSE PEOPLE SACRAMENTO SO WE JUST GOT IMPLEMENTED. AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL REALIZE WHAT THEY REAP THE BENEFITS AS WE'VE SEEN IN SO MANY CASES AS WELL AS HERE ON THE FLOOR. IT WILL HELP OUR CHILDREN. AND I HOPE THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE HAVE IS THIS GOOD FOR KIDS. RESEARCH SAYS YES THEY'RE THE MAKE OLD FOLKS LIKE US FEEL SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE PROBABLY WOULD SO WHAT WE'VE ALREADY HAD EXPERIENCE IN SCHOOL WE'VE DONE WHAT WE DON'T DO. THIS GIVE OUR KIDS AT I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE FOR S. B.. THREE TWENTY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKERS AND MEMBERS NO ONE EVER WANTS TO GO AFTER DOCTOR WEBER BUT HERE I'M GONNA TRY -- I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHO SHARED THE X. WHO SHARED BE OF THE METAPHOR OF WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS SO LET ME TO SHARE A QUICK STORY. I'M SURE DID A LITTLE BIT BEFORE BUT I AM I I'VE BEEN VERY OPEN ABOUT IT BUT I DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I WAS OUT RULES OF ALL HIGH SCHOOL IN BOYLE HEIGHTS. AND THE REASON WHY THAT HAPPENED WAS BECAUSE I WAS CONSTANTLY LATE CONSTANTLY TARDY ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL AT THE TIME HAD A THREE TRACK SYSTEM REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD THAT I THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA. AND IT STARTED AT SEVEN THIRTY IN THE MORNING. I WASN'T DRILL TEAM I HAVE TO BE ON CAMPUS AT SIX AM AND WHEN WE WEREN'T. I HAD TO EITHER WALK TO SCHOOL WHICH WAS ABOUT TWO MILES OR TAKE -- THE AND THE TRANSIT OR TAKE A BUS AND THERE WAS TWO BUS LINES THAT I HAVE TO TAKE SO I HAVE TO LEAVE HOME. AROUND SIX IN THE MORNING. IF I IF I DID THIS AND THEIR GOT THERE THERE GOT TO A POINT WHERE I WAS JUST TOO TIRED. THANK YOU I WAS TOO TIRED AND I WAS CONSTANTLY LATE I WAS CONSTANTLY TARDY. AND BECAUSE I WAS TARDY. SCHOOL AT THE TIME HAD A POLICY THAT IF YOU WERE TRUANT OR TARDY. PARENTS AT LU ES DE WOULD GET A TICKET. AND YOU WOULD GET FINE. AND MAYBE PERHAPS THAT YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER THAT BUT LOW INCOME PARENTS REALLY CAN'T AFFORD TO BE GETTING TICKETS BECAUSE YOU'RE FIFTEEN MINUTES LATE TO CLASS. ROTH WELL HAS CHANGED NOW AND SEVERAL OTHER SCHOOLS HAVE CHANGED. TO HAVE A LATER START TIME WHICH HAS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED [inaudible] GRADUATION RATES IN FACT BECAUSE IF THE SCHOOL STARTS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK OR EIGHT THIRTY KIDS ARE ACTUALLY THERE EARLIER. BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING BREAKFAST SCHOOL AND FOR MANY KIDS AND MANY KIDS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE ONLY TIME THAT THEY ACTUALLY GET TO EAT HIS BREAKFAST AND LUNCH [inaudible] SCHOOL. SO THEY'RE GONNA BE THERE SLIGHTLY EARLIER TO HAVE BREAKFAST THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET DROPPED OFF AT THAT TIME. SO I JUST WANT US TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE DAILY LIFE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF THESE KIDS ARE I REPRESENT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. ELLIE WAS THE IS THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE SECOND LARGEST IN THE NATION I CALLED MY SUPERINTENDENT. I CALLED ARBORE PRESIDENT THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION THEY HAVE CONCERNS. THERE'S A THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT AND WE ALWAYS HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF THE STUDENT THAT'S ACTUALLY ATTENDING THE CLASSROOM HOW DO WE MAKE SURE. THE KIDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE AXES. EQUITY OPPORTUNITY JUSTICE AND MIMI A SLIGHT CHANCE AT A BETTER LIFE AND THE LIFE THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY LIVING. AND IF THE SCIENCE IS THERE. EITHER WE BELIEVE EVEN THE THIGH AND OR WE DON'T. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT KIDS. TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS. THE ACTUAL BECAUSE THE SCIENCE IS THERE. THE REST OF THE ISSUES WILL GET TO FIGURE OUT BUT WILL NEVER GET TO THE POINT OF ACTUALLY RESOLVING THEM. IF WE CAN'T MOVE THE NEEDLE FORWARD AN EDUCATION AND THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT WE TALK ABOUT EDUCATION SO MANY THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP TODAY WHICH ARE. CREDIBLE AND VALID POINTS BUT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT OTHERWISE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY FACING. A DECREASE AND DOCTORS AND NURSES AND TEACHERS AND ENGINEERS AND IF WE CAN GET OUR KIDS TO SIMPLY GRADUATE. THEN HOW ARE WE GONNA INCREASE THE WORK FORCE FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND PLEASE ALWAYS CONSIDER. WHAT THE STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH I WONDER GOING TO SCHOOL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. I AM NOT SEEING. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHOPPERS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I REALIZE I'M SHORT SO. CALLED HERE. IT I I REMEMBER THIS ISSUE LAST TIME I SPOKE OUT IN SUPPORT OF IT SO I'M GOING TO STAY WITH THAT THING. BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU AFTER LISTENING ALL THE DISCUSSION -- THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE. YOU KNOW I I COME FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE. OF MY CHILDREN WENT TO NINE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AND I CAN TELL YOU. I WILL THEY WOULD TO SOME OF THE BEST SCHOOLS ONE OF THEM IS IN IOWA. AND IN IOWA WHICH IS WHAT ONE TWO OR THREE IN THE NATION. THEY STARTED LATER FOR THE CORE PROGRAMS. NOW THEY IT IS ZERO PERIOD BUT THEY HAD. THE SAME THING [inaudible] YOU KNOW. WE TALK ABOUT [inaudible] I SCIENCE. WE WORRY ABOUT BUS SCHEDULES. WERE YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A REAL ISSUE. AND OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS WE HAVE. REDESIGNED OUR ENTIRE. ENERGY GRID SYSTEM IN THE STATE. WE ARE CHANGING OUR HOLD TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN THIS STATE WE BROUGHT IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND GOT RID OF A WHOLE INDUSTRY MOVING OUT OF FOSSIL FUELS. WE COULD CHANGE OUR WHOLE ECONOMY. UNDER THE IDEA OF PROTECTING SCIENCE. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SCIENCE ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR OUR CHILDREN RECOGNIZING THAT? WE'RE NOT DOING SO GREAT IN CALIFORNIA I THINK WE'RE LASSEN MICE I WENT. FORTY THREE I THINK THAT'S KIND OF A GOOD THING WHEN I CAME HERE SIX YEARS AGO WHERE. FORTY NINE SO WE'RE KIND OF MOVING DOWN IN QUALITY BUT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. AND I THINK SCIENCE SHOWS WE SHOULD DO THIS. ADDITIONALLY I THINK IT'S NO. OF TWO MONTHS AGO THE PTA WAS AGAINST THIS I GOT A LETTER TODAY THE PTA IS SUPPORTING THIS. THEY'RE RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE TO DO MORE FOR OUR CHILDREN TO GET THEM THROUGH THIS. AND I LEAVE YOU THIS LAST WILL. FIVE BECAUSE I'M PROBABLY ONE THE OLDEST PEOPLE AROUND HERE IN. NINETEEN SIXTY SIX WHEN I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL AND TOWARDS AYE SCHOOL. CLASSES STARTED AT NINE AM. NOW THEY HAD ZERO PERIOD YOU CAN GO IN EARLIER IF YOU NEED SOME OF THE THINGS AND MATH AND THINGS GET EARLY I MEMBER MISTER HUGHES B. AND THERE. AT SEVEN THIRTY OR EIGHT BECAUSE HE SAID HE WORKED FOR A LIVING NOT LIKE HIS OTHER TEACHERS. HE WAS A QUITE A CHARACTER. BUT WE STARTED AT NINE AM. AND IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX CALIFORNIA ACADEMICALLY WAS TWO OR THREE IN THE NATION. WE ARE ONE OF THE BEST SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN THIS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE NEED TO GO BACK WHERE WE WERE AND RECOGNIZE WHAT WE DO IS YOU SCIENCE AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE OUR CHILDREN. CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AND GO FORWARD. IF WE CAN A CHANGE OF ECONOMY AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. BECAUSE OF SCIENCE. WE CAN USE SCIENCE ENSURE THAT OUR CHILDREN HAVE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I ASK YOU TO VOTE I ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MA'AM SPEAKER. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR I VOTED FOR THIS BILL. IN SPITE OF MANY CONCERNS THAT I HAD -- THEN ABOUT THE BILL. AND I STILL HAVE THOSE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE BILL. I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS. QUESTION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE ON THE FLOOR JUST NOW. IT JUST STRUCK ME THAT THIS BILL MAY BE MORE THAN ANY I'VE EVER HEARD IN FOUR YEARS. EVERY ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE FOR OR AGAINST WAS VALID AND EVERY ARGUMENT THAT YOU HEARD ME YOU COULD SAY. IS THE RIGHT THING. I DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING THAT SOUNDED MORE CORRECT OR OR NO THAT'S WRONG. EVERYTHING I HEARD. WAS THE FACT. THAT MIGHT BE A FIRST AT LEAST WHAT I'VE HEARD ON THIS FLOOR -- THE MY GOOD FRIEND MISTER ALLEN AS BOOKING AND I'M JUST GETTING JUST KIDDING I JUST GET. I WAS STARTING THERE I'M STARTING THE READING ALREADY -- IT IS A FACT. IS AN IRREFUTABLE FACT. THAT THE BRAIN SCIENCE SAYS THIS IS GOOD. FOR IT IS ALSO IRREFUTABLE FACT. THAT IF YOU MAKE THIS CHANGE YOU'RE CREATING. FOR MANY MANY PARENTS A DEPARTURE. BECAUSE IT IS A FACT. THAT MOST PARENTS DO NOT HAVE THE KIND OF FLEXIBLE JOBS. THAT WE DO. OR THAT OTHERS DO THAT ALLOW THEM TO SAY TO THEIR EMPLOYER COMING IN. HALF HOUR LATER OR WHATEVER UP TIME LATER THAT'S JUST A FACT. AND IF THIS BILL GOES FORWARD. AND PREVAILS AND IS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE AUTHOR IN THE COALITION WHOEVER ELSE HAVE TO BE VERY SERIOUS. ABOUT HOW TO CREATE. SOMETHING THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED. THAT CREATES SUCCESS. AND CONSIDERS THE HARDSHIP THAT IT CREATES FOR PARENTS YES IT IS A FACT THAT THE BRAIN SCIENCE IS GOOD FOR KIDS BUT WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT IT CREATES A HARDSHIP FOR FAMILIES FOR MANY. WE SHOULD BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATION WITH FAMILIES AND GETTING INPUT. FROM OUR FAMILIES AND IT IS A FACT. THAT SHOULD IT BE IMPLEMENTED THIS BILL WILL CREATE A HARDSHIP. FOR MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR STATE. UP SOME DISTRICTS WILL DO THIS. MUCH EASIER THAN OTHERS YOU HEARD EXAMPLES TODAY. FROM A FEW DISTRICTS THAT HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS. BUT THE REALITY IS THIS FOR MOST DISTRICTS [inaudible] THIS WILL. MEAN INCREASED COSTS THAT THEY HAVE NOT PLAN. FOR AND WILL NEED HELP. TO GET IT DONE IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY WILL HAVE TO LOOK FOR THAT HELP. IT'S FROM THIS CHAMBER. THE RED CHAMBER. IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS. USING THEIR LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA OR ANY OTHER LOCAL DOLLARS. THEY WILL NEED HELP ON THIS LEGISLATURE AND FROM THIS AND FROM THE GOVERNOR. TO GET THIS DONE. SO HERE I AM A YEAR LATER. STILL WILLING TO VOTE. FOR STILL VERY CONFLICTED. BUT WANTING MEMBERS TO BE SERIOUS IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DO HERE TODAY. THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE TRUE FACTS AND WE'VE GOT TO GIVE DISTRICTS SUPPORT. IT THIS MOVES FORWARD THIS CANNOT BE AN UNFUNDED MANDATE WE JUST EXPECTED TO WORK BECAUSE IF NOT WE DOOM. THE FAMILIES TO FAIL THE DISHES TO FAIL. AND POTENTIALLY THE KIDS TO FAIL YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY. YEAH THANK YOU MEMBERS. I JUST OF FELT COMPELLED TO STAND. THE DEFENSE OF THE POSITION BECAUSE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO I DO NOT FEEL THAT THIS BASED ON IGNORANCE. I THINK THE BELIEVING IN LOCAL CONTROL IS A VERY POWERFUL. PIECE OF OUR INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE. AND I BELIEVE HAVING BEEN A MEMBER THE SCHOOL BOARD WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PUBLIC SERVICE -- EXPERIENCES THAT I'VE HAD IN MY LIFETIME. I'VE HAD THOSE MEETINGS THAT HAVE GONE WELL INTO THE THE A. M.. BUT THAT'S THEIR JOB. AND THAT'S A JOB THAT I I NEVER REGRETTED. AND I ALWAYS FEEL THAT IT. WE NEED TO TRUST OUR LOCAL OFFICIALS TO KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITY. AND I THINK WE SHOW [inaudible] THE DEGREE. OF ARROGANCE THAT WE KNOW BETTER THAN THEY DO I THINK IT'S DEPLORABLE AND I DO NOT THINK IT'S BASED ON IGNORANCE AND I ANNOUNCED FOR NO. TO US SOME A FIRST TIME WORK HERE NEXT THANK YOU AGAIN I PROBABLY WASN'T GONNA RISE ON THIS BUT I JUST THOUGHT WE NEEDED PUT THE PERSPECTIVE. OF THE EMPLOYER INTO THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IMPACTS OUR FAMILIES WERE TALKING ABOUT DOING IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO TAKE -- OUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL AND HOW THAT WILL IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO GO TO WORK AND I'LL TELL YOU AS AN EMPLOYER AGAIN EARLIER TODAY I MENTIONED ON THE BUSINESSES THAT I'VE OWNING CONTINUE TO OWN. I'M IN THE AGGREGATE I HAVE. OWN BUSINESSES FOR OVER THIRTY SIX YEARS I'VE EMPLOYED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE I'VE LEARNED AN INDELIBLE TRUTH OF THREE POINTS. ONE COMPENSATE YOUR EMPLOYEES FAIRLY [inaudible] SEEMS RIGHT [inaudible] TO TELL THEM HOW WELL THEY'RE PERFORMING WITH THEIR SCHEDULE. IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN AND KEEP YOUR EMPLOYEES HAPPY. FOLLOW THOSE THREE TRUTHS. THIS LAW WILL MESS WITH NUMBER THREE AND WILL HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT WE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WILL REVERBERATE THROUGH THE ECONOMY AND IMPACT ALL OF OUR FAMILIES. UNFORTUNATELY I WILL BE NOT SUPPORTING THIS BILL. MEMBERS IT APPEARS THAT ALL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE CEASED. SEEING NO OTHER REQUEST TO SPEAK WILL RETURN TO US NOVEMBER GLORIA FIRST CLOSING COMMENTS. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND A SINCERE APPRECIATION TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR ROBUST DEBATE ODDS PROFESSION YOU SEE AN ISSUE THEY GAVE YOU SO MANY MEMBERS ON ALL SIDES THE AYE WE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS. ON BUT I THINK WHAT THE REFRAINS I'VE HEARD REPEATEDLY IS ACKNOWLEDGMENT IT WITHOUT QUESTION THE SCIENCE SUPPORTS TODAY'S BILL AND THAT IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR KIDS SO I FIGURE VOTE TODAY'S PRETTY CLEAR BUT I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY CLOSING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS. THAT WERE MENTIONED. FIRST OFF THERE WAS A REFERENCE THE FACT THIS BILL HAS NOT CHANGED AND OF COURSE AS YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM WHAT YOU'RE IT IS IN FACT CHANGE THIS BILL EXCLUDES RULE DISTRICTS. ARE AND ALSO HAS A DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATION DATE THERE'S MADE MENTION OF IMPACTS TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ARE THAT WAS ALSO DRESSED IN THIS BILL WILL NOT BE IMPLEMENTED. UNTIL A NEW CONTRACT IS ADOPTED -- THERE WAS MADE MENTION OF LOCAL CONTROL AND THE DESIRE TO ALLOW LOCALS TO MAKE THIS DECISION AND I I I SORT OF CHUCKLE AT THAT WEB REPRESENTATION SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS BODY HAS MADE MANY. MANY DIRECTIONS TO LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS IN THIS SESSION ALONE I BEGAN ABOUT AT THE STUDIES I'M THINKING ABOUT CULTURAL ADORNMENTS I'M BEING DONE RECENT YEARS AROUND LED OF LEAD PAINT IN SCHOOLS. AROUND THE REQUIREMENT FOR PIT PHYSICAL AT SCHOOL DAYS THAT POINT OUT A LOT OF THOSE THINGS ADDRESS. CHILDREN'S HEALTH THAT THE VERY THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS WITH THIS BILL. MEMBERS EAT I KNOW THAT THIS MAY BE HARD FOR SOME OF YOU I CERTAINLY HEARD FROM MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS BUT YOU LISTEN HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE STOOD UP COLLECTIVELY OR INDIVIDUALLY. AND SAID THAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO THE SCIENCE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE WE SAY AGAIN AND AGAIN DO THEY NOT SEE WHAT THE EXPERTS ARE SAYING AND WHY ARE THEY NOT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT. SO YOU CAN'T GET UP AND SAY THAT IN THE TURN AROUND AGAIN VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL. YOU CANNOT RISE UP AND SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE TOUGH FOR ADULTS WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING THAT'S IS IF YOU'RE NOT SUPPORTING KIDS WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE. MEMBERS IT'S THREE MILLION OF OUR CHILDREN CHILDREN AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS ARE CURRENTLY SLEEP DEPRIVED AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT FROM THE GUY FROM SAN DIEGO OR THAT GUY FROM CLOCK KANATA FLINTRIDGE YOU CAN TAKE IT. FROM THE FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF SLEEP MEDICINE THE CALIFORNIA ADOLESCENT HEALTH COLLABORATIVE THAT BITS. CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE LIST GOES ON AND ON OF EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD WHO KNOW THAT THE CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF OUR CURRENT PRACTICE OF STARTING A LITTLE TOO EARLY AND WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS OF THAT THEY'RE PRETTY SIMPLE MEMBERS. THEY CANNOT GET ENOUGH SLEEP AND SO THEY SEE PERFORMANCE IN THEIR SCHOOL GO DOWN YOU SEE MEMORY ATTENTION AND JUDGMENT CHALLENGE YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF TRUANCY INTEROP OUT RATES. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS DANGEROUS TO OUR COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. NOT MANY OF YOU KNOW I'M THE SON OF A MADE IN A GARDENER WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WORKING FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET IN THIS STATE I'VE LIVED THAT. ALRIGHT BUT IT WAS NEVER EASY TO GET TO SCHOOL FROM MY PARENTS ARE THAT WE MADE IT WORK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO PAINT THIS VIVIDLY. SO WHAT HAPPENS THOSE FAMILIES WILL KNOW THAT THOSE FAMILIES TODAY HAVE SOME LITTLE SLEEP DEPRIVED CHILDREN IN THE STATE. AND SO WE CAN FIX THAT FOR THEM IF THAT'S WHO YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT IS WHO THIS BILL SPEAKS. TO AND WHAT HAPPENS FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT MY NEED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS THE JUST AS THEY DO NOW FOR AFTER SCHOOL CARE SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES AND TO AND DEMONSTRATION AREAS CAN BE REMOVED FROM THE AFTER THE SCHOOL DATES THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL DAY.

SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE BY SENATOR SKINNER AND UPLAND PEACE OFFICER RECORDS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISS ON MADAM SPEAKER I TO GET PRESENTS SP FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE BY. CENTER SKINNER A BILL WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR A NARROW SCOPE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO BE AVAILABLE VIA A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. CALIFORNIA'S WHEN THE MOST SECRETIVE STATES IN THE NATION WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC ACCESS TO INTERNAL LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION RECORDS. IN FACT TWENTY EIGHT STATES ALLOW FOR GREATER TO EQUAL ACCESS OF RECORDS THAN WHAT IS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WOULD ALLOW PUBLIC ACCESS TO INVESTIGATE RECORDS RELATED. TO DISCHARGE OF A FIREARM USE OF FORCE WHICH RESULT IN DEATH OR GREAT BODILY INJURY. SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF ON THE JOB SEXUAL MISCONDUCT FIFTEEN FINDINGS OF ON THE JOB DISHONESTY. AMENDMENTS ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE WERE NARROWLY CRAFTED TO ACCOUNT FOR PRIVACY AND SAFETY INTERESTS OF AN OFFICER. BY ALLOWING FOR ANY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION INCLUDING. NAME. MAY BE REDACTED FROM THE RECORD. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. WE'VE NEVER HAD A BETTER TRAINED OR EDUCATED LAW ENFORCEMENT. PERSONNEL YET AT THIS TIME WE HAVE CHALLENGES BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITIES AND EROSION OF TRUST. TRANSPARENCY AND REALLY HELP BRING BACK TRUST BACK WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I DON'T. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE FROM OUR SENATOR FRIEND. BERKELEY AFTER MANY YEARS OF DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE I THINK WE FINALLY HAVE. FAIR AND REASONABLE PROPOSAL BEFORE US WHICH WILL HELP IMPROVE THE PUBLIC TRUST IN OUR POLICING ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IT'S A MEASURE AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SERVICES BECAUSE THAT IS LIMITED IN ITS CIRCUMSTANCES -- THE EXAMPLES WHEN THIS CAN BE YEARS THEY MUST BE SUBSTANTIATED SERIOUS SEXUAL VIOLENCE -- INCIDENT SO I MAKE SURE WE FOCUSED ON ISSUES THAT AREN'T FALSE CLAIMS THAT REALLY WANTS THAT ARE ARE FACTUAL AND THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW. HOW CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST? SECRETIVE LAWS IN OUR COUNTRY WHEN IT COMES. TO PERSONAL RECORDS FOR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS UNFORTUNATELY THIS. PREVENTS THE PUBLIC AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM LEARNING ABOUT SOME OF THE BAD ACCIDENTS FROM. A SMALL AMOUNT OF OFFICERS MAJORITY OFFICERS I DON'T HAVE THESE INCIDENTS IN THEIR PERSONNEL FILES. BUT THIS HAS LED TO A NUMBER OF OF ALL [inaudible] ABLE TO CAN YOU TO CARRY A BADGE AND AND HAVE THIS. AN ENORMOUS -- JOB IN OUR IN OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND FOR FOR EXAMPLE AND EXPOSE BY THE LA TIMES JUST TWO YEARS AGO FOUND THAT HAVE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY OFFICERS HIRED. A FEW YEARS EARLIER NINETY SEVEN SHOWED SIGNS OF DISHONESTY. NINETY TWO WERE DISCIPLINED BY OTHER AGENCIES WHILE ON DUTY. TWENTY NINE WERE FIRED OR RESIGN FROM OTHER AGENCIES FIFTEEN WERE FLAGGED FOR TRYING TO MANIPULATE THE RESULTS OF THE POLYGRAPH EXAM. A WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA BUT ITS IT PROBABLY A SAFE BET THAT THERE ARE A FEW OF THESE EXAMPLES AND OTHER. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND THEY WILL NEVER KNOW BECAUSE OF THE SECRETS OF LOS -- THIS -- ERODES THE TRUST OF PUBLIC SAFETY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT A TIME WE'RE TRYING TO INCREASE THE PUBLIC TRUST. AGAIN THIS IS A REASONED. I FAIR A PROPOSAL AND I ASK THAT WE A SUPPORT THIS TODAY AND THIS ALLOWS US TO SUPPORT THE MAJORITY OF A LOT FORSMAN OFFICERS THAT ARE DOING THE GREAT WORK. AND FOCUSING ON THE ONES THAT MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE THIS IMPORTANT POSITION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU SPEAKER MEMBERS. I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL COMMEND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS PARTICULAR DELICATE ISSUE. AND I THINK THAT -- THIS BILL IS A VERY VERY CLOSE. TO WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE BUT AS THE CLICHE GOES CLOSE ONLY COUNTS IN HORSESHOES AND HAND GRENADES. THIS ISN'T IT'S NOT QUITE THERE AND THIS CAME AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE. AND THERE WAS EVEN SOME ADMITTED -- DRAFTING ERRORS BECAUSE IT WAS RUSHED. BUT SOMETHING THIS CRITICAL NEEDS TO BE. COMPLETELY THOUGHT OUT BY ALL SIDES AND I THINK THERE HAS BEEN SOME GREAT COLLABORATION AND THERE ALSO WAS A GREAT NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF BILL. ADMITTEDLY THERE'S BEEN SOME VERY VERY FRUSTRATING CIRCUMSTANCES ENSIGN -- BRICK CLEAR ABUSES OF OF THE POSITION AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE THAT TRUST BILL BACK WITH THE COMMUNITY. BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS PARTICULAR. IS THAT IT INDICATES THAT -- THE RELEASE OF THESE VIDEOS. I CAN ONLY BE. HELD UP AT THE AGENCY DETERMINES THAT. THE DISCLOSURE WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY INTERFERE WITH THE INVESTIGATION. WHAT IN THE WORLD IS SUBSTANTIALLY MEAN? I THINK THAT'S A VERY AMBIGUOUS TERM THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS BILL IT'S VERY VERY CLOSE BUT IT'S NOT QUITE THERE SO FOR THAT REASON I CAN'T SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. SUNLIGHT AS THEY SAY IS THE BEST DISINFECTANT. AND WE HAVE TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE IN OUR STATE BETWEEN PRESERVING CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS AND PROTECTING. A PROCESS FOR THE PEOPLE TO PROTECT US. AND GIVING PUBLIC THE RIGHT. TO ACCESS RECORDS. POURED OVER THIS ONE CAREFULLY MEMBERS I READ IT. TOP TO BOTTOM WORD FOR WORD. I THOUGHT HARD LONG ABOUT IT AND I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I THINK IT HAS [inaudible] CRITICAL LIMITATIONS I THINK IT WILL ALLOW WHERE THERE IS A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION YOU CAN PUT A PAUSE ON THESE REQUESTS AND TELL THAT INVESTIGATIONS OVER. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT. AND TO BE CLEAR IT ONLY APPLIES. THESE RECORDS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES. ONE THE INCIDENT INVOLVED THE DISCHARGE OF A FIREARM. AT A PERSON [inaudible] TO THE USE OF FORCE RESULTED IN DEATH OR GREAT BODILY INJURY. THREE THE OFFICER WAS FOUND TO HAVE COMMITTED SEXUAL ASSAULT ON SOMEBODY IN CUSTODY. AND FOR THE OFFICER WAS FOUND TO HAVE COMMITTED DISHONESTY. IN AN INVESTIGATION ON THE WITNESS STAND OR IN A REPORT. MOST OFFICERS OUT THERE MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS ARE HONEST HARD WORKING PEOPLE TRYING TO DO A VERY DIFFICULT JOB AND KEEP A SAFE. BUT THERE ARE SOME BAD APPLES. I THINK THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO ACCESS AND YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU DISCHARGE A FIREMAN A PERSON IN LINE OF DUTY. I'VE KNOWN CONSERVE DONE THAT. THAT MESSES WITH YOUR HEAD. AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS WRONG IT'S ALWAYS IT'S OFTEN JUSTIFIED. AND THAT SHOULD COME OUT. THE THE INVESTIGATION THAT CLEARS THE OFFICER THAT WAS JUSTIFIED DISCHARGING A FIREARM. THAT SHOULD COME OUT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THAT. THAT'S WHY THE POLICE CHIEF SUPPORT THIS BILL. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THEM ON BOARD SAY YES THIS IS THE RIGHT COMPROMISE THE STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE. I'M NOT GOING TO PRETEND TO YOU THAT THIS IS AN EASY VOTE IT'S A TOUGH VOTE. BUT I THINK THE SENATOR HAS DONE A VERY VERY GOOD JOB AND WORKED WITH A LOT OF INTEREST GROUPS. AND I THINK WHAT YOU SEE IN FRONT OF YOU. IT'S PROBABLY STRIKING THE BEST BALANCE WE CAN STRIKE AYE URGENT AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. MEMBERS BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT I'M GOING TO ALLOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER LACKEY SPEAK AGAIN. TO MAKE A CLARIFYING POINT. YEAH MEMBERS DIE JUST FOR INFORMATION I SPOKE TO A DIFFERENT BILL. THAT'S AUTHORED BY.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER LET'S BILL DOES A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ARE STILL SOMETHING TO BE WORKED ON MY CONCERN IS WILL PUBLIC EXPLODES LAW ENFORCEMENT WHISTLE BLOWERS. SCOURGE HIM FOR MAKING DECISION REPORT THE MOST SERIOUS OFFENSES OF MISCONDUCT. AND LETTER TO THE JOURNAL HAVE NO LEGAL STANDING. IF BE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE CURLY CONTAINS A PROVISION THAT WOULD IDENTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REPORT. MISCONDUCT OF OTHER OFFICERS. THE PROVISION EXPOSES WHISTLEBLOWERS [inaudible] OBJECTIVE STANDARD AND WHETHER THEIR DIGNITY IS RELEASED OR REDACTED [inaudible] THE PROVISION -- PROVIDES NO PROTECTION FROM THE IDENTITY OF A WHISTLEBLOWER BECAUSE DISTINCT CASES A MISCONDUCT OR HIGH PROFILE FROM THE ORGANIZATION. IN THE HUGE AUTHORS WILL KNOW WHO WAS THERE AND WHO WASN'T. IT A TIME IT IS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT SAFEGUARD THE DUTIES OF WHISTLEBLOWERS. THIS BILL FALLS VERY SHORT. IMPROVE PUBLIC TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT BY ENCOURAGING MORE WHISTLEBLOWING OF MISCONDUCT IN NOT LESS. THANK YOU I AM NOT SEEING ANY OTHER REQUEST TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. I WILL RETURN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING FIRST CLOSING COMMENTS. THANK YOU BOTH SPEAKER JUST -- TO TO JUST ADDRESS THE POINT OF MY DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE OF THE BILL EXPLICITLY STATES IN SECTION TO BE. FIVE FIVE OUR AGENCY SHOULDER DOCTOR RECORD DISCLOSE PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION ONLY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PURPOSES. TO PRESERVE THE ANONYMITY OF COMPLAINTS AND WITNESSES SO THEREFORE S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE EXPLICITLY REQUIRES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES REDACT ALL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. HAVE ANY FELLOW OFFICER WHO LODGES A COMPLAINT AGAINST OR REPORTS MISCONDUCT OF A FELLOW OFFICER. BUT BUT THAT'S MAJORITY AGAIN GOING BACK TO THIS POINT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICE HAVE EXCELLENT RECORDS.

THIRTEEN NINETY THREE CLERK WILL READ SENATE BILL THIRTEEN NINETY THREE BY SENATOR MITCHELL AND OTHERS ACTUALLY TO SENTENCING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS ARISE PRESENT SP. THIRTEEN NINETY THREE A MODERATE REFORM OF A SINGLE SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT. THAT ARE INCREASE THE FAIRNESS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE BILL RESTORES THE COURT'S DISCRETION IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE AND AT THE TIME OF SENTENCING TO STRIKE A FIVE YEAR SENTENCE WOULD PASS HANDS MEANT FOR SERIOUS. FELONY CONVICTIONS. WHILE MOST SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS CAN BE DECLINED IF THE JUDGE BELIEVES THEY'RE UNJUST. A FIVE YEAR AND HAS BEEN IS MANDATORY IN ALL CASES THAT IS APPLIED CONSECUTIVELY FOR EACH CONVICTION. THIS ON TOP OF THE BASINS QUICKLY ADDS UP TO TEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY YEAR SENTENCES. SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS CONSISTENTLY RESULT NO LONGER PERIODS OF INCARCERATION AND ARE THE MAIN CONTRIBUTORS TO PRISON OVERCROWDING. BUT RESTORING THE COURT'S DISCRETION LEUCHARS HURT BECAME RETURNED TO A SPACE WHERE JUDGES HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAILOR SENTENCES DEPICT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. LENGTHY PRISON TERMS DON'T DETER CRIMES THEY DON'T REDUCE RECIDIVISM OF THEY DON'T HELP REHABILITATION BUT THEY DO LEAD TO OUR BROKEN FAMILIES HIGH FINANCIAL BURDENS AND LACK OF OP OPPORTUNITY. A FAIR AND JUST DESPAIR AND JUST SENTENCING REFORM WAS SIMPLY RETURN JUDICIAL DISCRETION. TO THE JUDGE'S HANDS WHICH WAS IN EFFECT BEFORE. THE MASS INCARCERATION PUBLIC POLICIES. PASSED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. I HAVE LITERALLY BEEN IN COURTROOMS WHERE HAVE SEEN JUDGES. NEAR INTENDED NEARLY IN TEARS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO STRIKE THESE ENHANCEMENTS AND THEY KNOW THAT EVEN IF THEY'RE GIVING A BASE TERM OF THREE OR FIVE YEARS. ON A CONVICTION WHICH FITS THE CRIME. BUT THEY MAY BE SENTENCING SOMEONE. TO OFTENTIMES IT TO BE FIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS -- BUT ADDED TO THAT BECAUSE OF THIS FIVE YEAR ENHANCEMENT. AND SO THIS JUST MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO DESERVE IT GET IT. THOSE THAT DON'T. POLICE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL TO A JUDGE WHO VERY WELL STILL MAY. THEN FORCES BUT A LEASE THE JUDGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY HERE ALL SIDES IN A VALUE IT THE CASE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. NOT STRIPPING THE POWER AWAY FROM THE JUDGES [inaudible] AND HAVING. INDIVIDUALS LOCKED UP FOR MANY MORE YEARS. THEN WHAT FITS THE CRIME FOR WHICH THEY'RE CONVICTED WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AIBO. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI YOUR RECOGNIZED.

WHAT IS THAT PERSON DESERVE A LATER SENTENCE? SO SINCE NO ONE ELSE ONCE AGAIN WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE VICTIMS THEN I WILL [inaudible] TRUST ME. WHEN I SAY THIS TO YOU? YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH THIS WEEK TO CODDLE CRIMINALS. HOW ABOUT WE TAKE A BREAK HERE GIVE IT A REST AND VOTE NO ON THIS BILL? THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER COM LOCKER DOUGH. I THINK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB. THIRTEEN NINETY THREE TO THOSE OF YOU WHO SAY JUDICIAL DISCRETION RESULTS IN BY A SENTENCING. THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO THAT. WE SEE THAT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY WHERE THERE IS DISCRETION THERE A STATISTICAL BIAS AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS. FROM THE MOMENT OF AN ENCOUNTER WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OFFICER DECIDES WHETHER TO PULL SOMEONE OVER NOT AN OFFICER DECIDES WHETHER OR NOT TO ARREST. pPROSECUTORS DECISION TO CHARGE OR NOT PROSECUTORS DECISION ON WHETHER TO APPLY ENHANCEMENTS OR STACK THE CHARGES AND THE COURT'S DECISION ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE PENALTY. THIS BILL. ADDRESSES ONE STEP IN THAT CHAIN. CURRENTLY THE PROSECUTORS HAVE ALL THE DISCRETION IF THEY CHOOSE TO CHARGE THE ENHANCEMENT THE JUDGE'S HANDS ARE TIED. THEY HAVE TO IMPOSE THE ENHANCEMENT. IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW PROSECUTORS WILL CONTINUE TO HALF THEY HAVE IN THE PAST. USE THEIR DISCRETION AS THEY DO TODAY TO SEEK THE ENHANCEMET BUT JUDGES. THE ONES WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. WILL ALSO HAVE THE DISCRETION TO IMPLY TO APPLY THE ENHANCEMENT OR NOT. THE EVIDENCE IS VERY CLEAR MANDATORY MINIMUMS TRUTH IN SENTENCING DETERMINANT SENTENCES AND MANDATORY ENHANCEMENTS HAVE DEVASTATED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES SOMEHOW THE CURE FOR BIAS ONLY MADE THINGS WORSE. WE SHOULD FIND REASONABLE INCREMENTAL BILLS LIKE THIS ONE TO HELP ON WINE THE LEGACY OF MASS INCARCERATION AND THE MISTAKES OF PRIOR GENERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS. THESE PRIOR GENERATIONS OF LAWMAKERS WERE NOT AS DIVERSE AS WE ARE NOW. THERE WERE FEWER WOMEN IN THERE WERE FEWER PEOPLE OF COLOR THERE WAS NOT AN OUT LGBTQ MEMBER UNTIL SENATOR SHEILA KEWL IN. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THERE WAS NOT ONE INDIAN AMERICAN MEMBER UNTIL TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASH KALRA WAS ELECTED. LAWMAKERS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WERE LESS DIVERSE AND DID NOT BENEFIT FROM THE WEALTH OF RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE TODAY TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF GET TOUGH ON CRIME POLICIES. SO IT FALLS ON US TO ADDRESS THE BIASES AND LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE PRIOR GENERATIONS OF LAWMAKERS LET'S DO THE RIGHT THING TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY THREE AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE HERE FROM THE LOS ANGELES AREA WHO HAS PROBABLY SHARED MOST OF THE RESEARCH AND INFORMATION I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU. BUT ALSO REMIND YOU THAT PROBABLY WHAT AND COUPLE HOURS AGO THE COMET WAS MAY ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT WE NEED TO GIVE THE JUDGES THE DISCRETION. BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE WAS DOING SOME OTHER THINGS AND WE SAID WAIT A MINUTE WE WERE MOVING IN A DIRECTION OF JUDGE DISCRETION. AND THAT IS TRUE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE ENHANCEMENTS. IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO BUT IT SAYS THAT IN THE END. IT JUDGE SHOULD HAVE THE DECISION A A TO DO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE ENHANCEMENT THAT IS BEING RECOMMENDED BASED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS THERE. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN IN A COURTROOM AND YOU'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS IS ALMOST AS LIKE A MATH GAME THERE'S THREE PUT THIS THIS FOR FOR THAT THIS FIVE WITH THI THAT. AND I'M JUST BUT NO WOULDN'T AND I WAS IN ONE COURT ROOM WHERE SOMEONE HAD A CALCULATOR AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY CALCULATING THE YEARS OR HOW MUCH TIME A PERSON HAVE TO SERVE IN THE NECK AT SUBTRACT TWO YEARS FOR THIS OF I MEAN. THE THE CONCEPT OF JUDGING AND JUDICIAL DISCRETION HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT BECAUSE OF ALL THE MATH AND WE GIVE THEM IN TERMS OF HOW YOU. CALCULATE WHO DESERVES TO SPEND MORE TIME AND WHO DOES NOT SO I THINK IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT IF WE GO BACK AND SAY TO OURSELVES AS WE SAID A FEW MINUTES AGO AGAINST THE OTHER BILL. THAT WE WON AT THE JUDGES TO HAVE THE DISK [inaudible] SOME DISCRETION. EVERYONE ELSE STILL HAS THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE THE SENTENCING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO A BASICALLY ASK FOR ENHANCEMENTS ALL THAT IS THERE BUT RIGHT NOW THE LAW SAYS A JUDGE CANNOT. CANNOT REMOVE AN ENHANCEMENT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THAT DISCRETION OR HERE SHE SAID HAVE THE DISCRETION TO SAY OKAY IN THIS CASE. WE SHOULD DO TEN YEARS OF ENHANCEMENT BUT WE SHOULD DO FIVE OR MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE ENHANCEMENT BASED ON SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THIS GIVES A JUDGE SOME DISCRETION TO BASICALLY DEAL WITH THE INDIVIDUAL CASE AND THE NEEDS AT A VIA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IT I BOTH S. B. THIRTEEN NOT EIGHTY THREE IN THIS IS NOT BEING SOFT ON CRIME THIS IS BEING REASONABLE ABOUT WHAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT AND HOW WE PLAN TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BOTH THE THIRTEEN NINETY THREE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS THIS BILL IS SOFT ON CRIME I'M TIRED OF THESE CONTINUED MEASURES THAT KEEP GETTING INTRODUCED IN THIS CHAMBER. THEY'RE MAKING IT EASIER TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON OUT OF JAIL WHO SHOULD BE THERE AND OUT ONTO OUR STREETS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NOT NO VOTE. I AM NOT SEEING ANY. FURTHER REQUEST TO SPEAK IF I'M WRONG SOMEONE WILL WAVERED ME. OKAY WE WILL RETURN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA FOR HIS CLOSING COMMENTS. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER THINK SO TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO SUPPORT. THESE MANDATORY SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS AS WE'VE HEARD OF CREATED A HARSH. AND ARBITRATION SUMMER PUNISHMENT IS DISPROPORTIONATE. TO A POOR PERSON'S CULPABILITY DO NOT SERVE THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. CONTRARY OF BIRDS TO COLLEAGUES IN OPPOSITION. THIS BILL DOES NOT REDUCE ANYONE SENTENCES. HE GIVES JUDGES THE DISCRETION TO ACTUALLY. DECIDE A SENTENCE THAT FITS THE CRIME FOR WHICH SOMEONE IS BEING PROSECUTED. FOR ELEVEN YEARS. I WAS IN THE COURTROOM. EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND I'VE SEEN HOW JUSTICE IS METED OUT. AND I'VE SEEN THE FRUSTRATIONS A JUDGE'S. WHO HAD THEIR HANDS TIED AND I'LL TELL YOU CAN LIST I'LL AN ARBITRARY PICK OUT SOME SERIOUS FELONIES FOR WHICH WE KNOW. THE FIVE YEARS IS NOT GOING TO BE STRICKEN. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE PLENTY [inaudible] OF SITUATIONS INCLUDING SITUATIONS IN WHICH VICTIMS COME FORWARD AND ASK FOR MORE LENIENCY. THEN THE SENTENCE THAT'S BEING IMPOSED. BUT EVEN THEIR VOICE CAN'T BE HEARD IN THE SITUATIONS IN WHICH IN WHICH THEY MORE LENIENCY THE REALITY IS THAT WE NEED TO HEAR EVERYONE'S VOICES CERTAINLY THE VICTIMS. CERTAINLY THE PROSECUTORS WHO ARE THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY MAKE THE DECISION. AS TO WHETHER. TO CHARGE THESE ENHANCEMENTS. AND THEY DO QUITE FREELY. BUT WE NEED [inaudible] SOME [inaudible] JUDGE. TO MAKE THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER THE ENHANCEMENT FITS THE CRIME. WE NEED TO GIVE OUR JUDGES THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT HAVE ALL SIZE BE HEARD ON THE MATTER AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU [inaudible] ONE THING [inaudible] IS THAT. JUDGES ARE BEING SOFT ON FOLKS THAT HAVE. SERIOUS FELONIES ARE CONTINUE. TO COMMIT SERIOUS FELONIES. GOING TO A COURT OF HOW WATCH EVERY DAY AND YOU'LL SEE THAT TO BE THE CASE. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE. THE SYSTEM IN TERMS ADDITION DISCRETION TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DISCRETION TO NOT LET ANYONE OFF THE HOOK. BUT TO LET JUDGES ACTUALLY DO THEIR JOB WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOOK.

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS THERE'S A MEMBER OF OUR CAUCUS YOU'D LAST WEEK -- pIF I DID WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO. AND THAT WAS A SAILOR BIT ABOUT HIM BEFORE -- WE SAY GOODBYE TO HIM TODAY. THE REASON HE SAID THIS. IS A TESTAMENT TO HIS CHARACTER. HE DID NOT WANT THERE TO BE A TRIBUTE ALL ABOUT HIM FOCUSED ON HIM. AND SORT OF A HIT THE ANTI EGOTISTICAL REACTION WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING YOU OFTEN SEE IN POLITICS. AND I THINK THAT IS ALL THE MORE REASON WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SAY A FEW WORDS OF RECOGNITION TO OUR GOOD COLLEAGUE ROCKY CHAVEZ. THE MEMBER FROM OCEANSIDE. WHO IS -- HAVING HIS LAST DAYS OF ANY MEMBER ON THIS FLOOR. OTHER HOPING TO SEE AND WE WILL SEE HIM AGAIN IN TWO YEARS. I FIRST MET ROCKY NOT AS A FRESHMAN MEMBER BUT IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO RUN FOR OFFICE. AND NOT MANY MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE AT THIS TIME NO AND IT WAS HEAVILY DISCOURAGE THAT AT THAT TIME MY PARTY AND MY CAUCUS HELP. IN THE RACE I WAS RUNNING IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THIS IS BEFORE THE EVEN NUMBERED YEAR ACTUALLY. AND ROCKY REACHED OUT TO ME AND ASKED HOW COULD HE HELP AND NOT A LOT OF MEMBERS DO THAT THAT EARLY IN A CYCLE WHEN THEIR OWN PARTY. IS TELLING THEM DON'T GO HELP. AND WE HAVE SEEN THE LEADERSHIP THAT HE HAS HAD IN THIS BODY IN THIS TIME AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. YOU OFTEN REMEMBER I'M SURE THOSE TIMES WHEN HE'S HAD HIS MIKE UP. EITHER IN COMMITTEE OR ON THIS FLOOR AND SAID I'M GONNA TAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH. I STARTED TEASING ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU CAN ALMOST. YOU CAN ALMOST BET THAT THAT'LL BE THE BEGINNING OF HIS REMARKS. I'M GONNA SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH IN EVERY TIME HE WAS ABLE TO OFFER A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAT HADN'T ALREADY BEEN REPEATED. THAT HADN'T BEEN MADE AND HE MADE THAT PERSPECTIVE. SO WELL AND IT OFTEN CHANGED HOW. WE REACTED TO BILLS IN THAT THE COMMITTEE ARE ON THIS FLOOR. HIS COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION. BEFORE HE GOT HERE AND EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE HE GOT HERE IS EVIDENT IN HIS LEGISLATION AS AS HIS COMMITMENT TO VETERANS INCLUDING WOMEN VETERANS. BECAUSE ROCKY CAME TO THIS CHAMBER. VETERANS WILL NOW HAVE BETTER SUPPORT AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND HIGHER EDUCATION FOR VETERANS SERVICE CENTERS. THAT HAVE NEEDED FUNDING FOR YEARS. BECAUSE OF ROCKY VETERANS WILL HAVE MORE SUPPORT NOT ONLY IN HIGHER EDUCATION BUT IN CONNECTING WITH JOBS AND BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY FEMALE VETERANS BECAUSE OF ROCKY. AND BECAUSE OF ROCKY YOU YOU WILL HAVE VETERANS WHO HAVE IN STATE TUITION IN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE ORIGINALLY FROM THAT IS BECAUSE OF HIS LEADERSHIP AND HIS SUPPORT. NOT ONLY FOR EDUCATION BUT VETERANS. AND WE ALL NO THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT HE PLAYED IN HELPING OUR STATE MEET THE AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE CHANGE ROLES RULES THAT WE HAVE SET FOR IT. THROUGH HIS ACTIVE PARTICIPATION BRAVERY. AND LEADERSHIP ON CAPITOL TRADE. AND SO WE ARE -- I THINK A BETTER BODY BECAUSE ROCKY HAS BEEN HERE. I'M I AM PERSONALLY VERY VERY GRATEFUL. FOR NOT ONLY HIS SERVICE BUT HIS ENCOURAGEMENT TO RUN AT A TIME WHEN OTHER PEOPLE WERE SAYING THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN WIN. AT ALL AND YOUR OWN PARTY WAS TELLING YOU COULDN'T DO IT. AND DISCOURAGING YOU FROM DOING IT. THAT'S THE TYPE OF LEADERSHIP THAT ROCKY CHAVEZ SHOWS. SO ROCKY WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN HERE WE ARE SO GRATEFUL THAT MARRIED LESS UP HERE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AGAIN IN TWO SHORT YEARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS BAKER. MR DOLLAR YOU ARE RECOGNIZED I'D LIKE TO JUST ALSO. SAY A FEW KIND WORDS TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE ROCKY CHAVEZ. TO AND BY THE WAY ON WAS MY SEAT MATE AND I WANT TO JUST TELL THE STORY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE HE SAT. BEHIND ME. THE FIRST YEAR. AND THEN -- HIS TEAMMATE A ACTUALLY MIKE MORRELL WAS MY SEAT MATE AND HE WENT TO THE SENATE SANTA I HAD AN OPEN SEAT. AND UP HIS SEAT MAYBE DIDN'T ALONG WITH VERY WELL THAT SET BEHIND ME I WON'T MENTION HIS NAME BUT HE RAISES MY CAN OFF A LOT -- SO ROCKY NEVER HOUSE THE SPEAKER. HE JUST PICKED THIS STUFF UP THE FIRST DAY THAT THAT DOES WAS AVAILABLE AND MOVED UP NEXT TO ME AND SO I I GOT A SEAT MATE TOM. AND A GOOD FRIEND ON TOP OF THAT AND I WANTED TO SAY. ROCK WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU YOU'RE AWESOME. NEXT YOUR WIFE IN YOUR IN YOUR FAMILY AND ALSO I'M. THE ONE THING I REALLY LOVE ABOUT YOU IS THAT YOU'RE A GUY WHO JUST MAKES A DECISION. STICK WITH IT AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU WERE PROBABLY A LEADER IN THE SERVICE TO USE YOU YOU'VE BEEN TRAINED TO DO THAT. AND YOU DO IT WELL AND WE CAN COUNT ON YOU WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE THERE I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU BACK. SOON ANNA GOD BLESS AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIMON MEMBER DOLLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. NO -- I THINK IT WAS YESTERDAY -- WE PAY TRIBUTE TO JOHN MCCAIN AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT IS HOW HE WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE AND HOW HE WAS JUST A VERY PRINCIPLED MAN AND OFTEN MADE. A DIFFICULT ECISIONS THAT WERE THAT WERE NOT IN LINE WITH THE PARTY DECISION. AND THAT'S HOW I SEE YOU. OF SOMETIMES YOU THE LONE REPUBLICAN ON ON A REALLY DIFFICULT VOTES AND THAT ARE NOT IN LINE WITH YOUR PARTY BUT DOING THE DOING THE RIGHT THING. A I REALLY HAVE APPRECIATED WORKING WITH YOU ON VETERANS ISSUES -- OFTEN WE HAVE -- WE'VE I'VE HAD TO COME TO YOU AND SAY CAN YOU HURT HELP ME WORK THROUGH THIS -- I AM NOT A VETERAN MYSELF BUT THE THE THE INFORMATION AND EXPERIENCES THAT YOU'VE HAD REALLY HELPED ME TO BE A MUCH BETTER AND LEADER. IN THE ON THE VETERANS COMMITTEE AND AND THEN OF COURSE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE MILITARY COUNCIL HAS BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MAKING SURE THAT THOSE MILITARY BASES. STAY OPEN AND AND YOUR BACKGROUND HAS HAS REALLY OF PROGRESS STATUS IN IN THAT AREA. SO -- BEYOND THAT YOUR FOCUS ON ON EDUCATION AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND YOUR PASSION FOR MAKING SURE THAT THAT EVERYBODY THAT'S HERE EVERY. EVERY CHILD THAT IS IN THIS COUNTRY THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO BETTER. YOU ARE OF A GREAT MAN AND I'VE REALLY APPRECIATED. WORKING WITH YOU AND I WILL REALLY MISS. YOUR GUIDANCE ROCKY. THANK YOU SUMMIT ENVIRONMENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I THINK OF THEY PUT ROCKY IMMEDIATE GATHER A SEAT MATES BECAUSE THEY FIGURED WERE CRUSTY OLD VETERANS IF WE GOT INTO A FIGHT NOBODY WOULD CARE OKAY. BUT I DO HAVE ONE THING TO POINT NOW. TO MY COLLEAGUES. AND THAT IS AS MILITARY PEOPLE. ROCKY WAS A MARINE COLONEL. THAT'S PRETTY HIGH UP IN THE MARINE CORPS. AND THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENT I CAN GIVE THE ROCKY IS IF WE WERE MOBILIZED. AND I WAS PUT UNDER HIS COMMAND. I WOULD GO ALL THE WAY WITH THANK YOU. I THINK THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I KNOW I CAN TALK MISTER VOEPEL -- BUT I JUST WANNA SAY I ROCKET I CAME IN. WERE CLASSMATES TOGETHER. AND HAVE ENJOYED A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP. ON BEEN WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TOGETHER WE WE'RE BOTH PASSED BY AT THAT TIME SPEAKER JUMPER AS TO GO ON A TRIP FOR FOR FOR YOUNG LEADERS WE ALL AND WE LAUGHED ABOUT THAT A LOT. OF BUT WE WENT BACK TO AT THE WASH THAT VIRGINIA AREA IT'S BEEN A WEEK TOGETHER. I'M AND REALLY DELVING DOWN I THINK IN THE HISTORY OF THE GOVERNMENT AND LEADERSHIP AND AND I AND WE FORMED A REAL BOND THERE -- UNLIKE JACKIE I WAS THINKING OF JOHN MCCAIN WHEN WE'RE GOING TO SAY GOODBYE. TO I'M OUTS A DIFFERENT KIND BY. HER. DATA BUT JUST THE IDEA OF STARTING IN SERVICE AT A VERY YOUNG AGE AS I DID. AND THEN WHEN YOU GET OUT YOU CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO SERVE YOUR COUNTRY. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL WHETHER IT'S THROUGH DOING THIS. BUT THE SERVICE THAT YOU'VE GIVEN TO THIS [inaudible] STATE TO THIS COUNTRY. INTO THIS BODY. SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF I AM AND I WILL CERTAINLY MISS YOU AND I LOOK FOR ANOTHER BRAVE REPUBLICAN. BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY TIMES WHEN I HAVE NEEDED THAT ONE EXTRA VOTE. AND I ALWAYS KNOW. IT'S A BRIGHT JUST ISSUE OF JUSTICE. ROCKY CHAVEZ WILL BE THERE AMISH. THANK YOU DOCTOR EGGMAN. MISTER COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. SWING AROUND HERE SITE LOOK ROCKY I REALLY WANT TO JUST TELL A STORY ABOUT ROCKY BUT BEFORE I GET TO THE STORY -- I JUST WANT TO HONOR ROCKY YOU CAME AND I GOT TO KNOW YOU AS WE WERE ELECTED CLASS OF TWENTY TWELVE BUT WHAT A LONG HISTORY OF PUBLIC SERVICE TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF COURSE.

AND EXPRESS THAT THINGS HE THINKS. AND OF COURSE I GOT TO KNOW THAT ABOUT HIM JUST THE CONDUCT OF HIS WORK. BUT THE MOST MEMORABLE WAY I LEARNED THAT IS WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE. MY OFFICE WAS THE OFFICE OF MY COLLEAGUE MISTER RODRIGUEZ HAS. TWENTY ONE EIGHTY EIGHT AND THAT THAT'S A NICE OFFICE SOON HASN'T ESCAPED PACKAGE.

THE THING I THINK THAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT YOU AND THEN I WILL MISS. IS THAT I FOUND SOMEONE ELSE IN THE CAUCUS WHO WAS ABOUT MY SIZE SO WE SEE EYE TO EYE. ON MORE THINGS THAN PEOPLE REALIZE -- WE STARTED OFF. GOSH BACK WHEN I WAS CITY COUNCIL BEFORE EUROPEAN WE SOMEHOW ENDED UP MEETING ON THE TRAILING YOU SUPPORTED ME AND I SUPPORTED YOU AND IT WAS A NICE LITTLE. KIND OF REPRIEVE GETTING TO THE ASSEMBLY RELATIONSHIP THAT WE DEVELOPED AND THEN OVER TIME GETTING TO KNOW MARY AND HEARING ABOUT ALL YOUR KIDS AND YOUR GRANDKIDS AND ALL THE COOL STUFF YOU GUYS DO. AND SO I THINK -- GINO JAY'S SPEAKS FOR MORE THAN JUST HIMSELF WHEN HE SAYS THAT THE WAY IN WHICH YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF APPEAR IN THE ASSEMBLY AND STICKING YOUR GUNS AND SOMETIMES STRAYING OFF THE PATH AND SURPRISING PEOPLE. WITH HOW YOU VOTE IS IS. AN EXTRAORDINARY THING TO SEE UP HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY ONE I THINK YOU FOR ALL YOUR YEARS OF SERVICE TO YOUR COUNTRY INTO THIS STATE. AND WISH YOU VERY WELL. THE GAME IS MELENDEZ. LAST NOT LEAST ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LOOKS LIKE I'M A BATON CLEAN UP HERE. YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF OF ROCKY -- I THINK OF MANY OF THE THINGS THAT ALL OF YOU I'M HAVE HAVE SAID. THE ONE THING OF COURSE THAT STICKS OUT IS THAT HE IS A MARINE. AND THAT HE WAS A COLONEL IN THE MARINE CORPS AND YOU DON'T GET TO THE RANK OF COLONEL. WITHOUT BEING HAVING INCREDIBLE TALENT AND AN INCREDIBLE COMMAND PRESENCE. AND I THINK OF THAT PHRASE THAT. THE FINE MARINES A SIMPLIFY ALWAYS FAITHFUL. AND FOR ME FOR THE TIME THAT I WAS -- THE LEADER. IRAQI WAS WAS ALWAYS FAITHFUL AND HE WAS ALWAYS LOYAL. AND IF WE ARE GOING DOWN A PATH IF HE WOULD ARGUE WITH ME DEBATE WITH ME WHETHER WAS THE RIGHT PATH BUT ONCE THAT PATH WAS SET. HE STOOD RIGHT NEXT TO ME AND CONTINUED TO KEEP FIGHTING THAT FIGHT. AND AS WE KNOW. THERE WAS OUT THERE'S BEEN A FEW TOUGH VOTES -- AND FOR FOR ROCKY THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT THE OUTSIDE. BELIEVE THERE WHAT THE ERRONEOUS INFORMATION WAS WHEN HE KNEW THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. HE WAS GONNA DO IT. IN YOU KNOW MARINES HAVE THAT OTHER. THAT OTHER SAYING THAT THE FEW PROUD. AND THAT ALSO DEFINES THE FINES ROCKY. THERE ARE MANY OF US. IN THIS ROOM THERE'S EIGHTY POLITICIANS. BUT I THINK THERE ARE FEW FEW LESS [inaudible] STATESMAN ROCKY IS A STATESMAN. HE IS GOING TO BE MESSED HERE IN THIS HOUSE HE MESSED. IN HIS DISTRICT. IN CALIFORNIA IS GONNA MISS HIM FOR ALL OF HIS LEADERSHIP AND ALL OF WHAT HE DID FOR FOR US THANK YOU SO MUCH ROCKY. THANK YOU SOME A MEMBER MAYES CHAVEZ. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DEATH. WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THE WONDERFUL COMMENTS AS BASU WITH MARY HERE BEEN AND LYRICS. THE YOU KNOW IN IN. YOU'RE RIGHT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE MARINE CORPS AND AS I CAME THROUGH AND I WAS PROBABLY SAY THE SCOUTS -- NOTHING I LEARNED IT LEADERSHIP THE MARINE CORPS I DIDN'T ENCOUNTERING THE BOY SCOUTS FIRST. THE THE BEST ANALOGY IS I THINK THAT THEY GAVE US IS IT'S NEVER ABOUT YOU ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION. AND THE USER STORY RANDY SHARED WITH THAT EARLY I WOULD SAY GOT RAINED OUT MY STORIES THAT. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU AS A YOUNG LIEUTENANT COME INTO AN ORGANIZATION YOU THINK YOU'RE ALL THAT WITH YOUR LITTLE? BUTTER BAR AS I'M SURE MATHIS KNOWS I'M TALKING ABOUT THE YOU. THEY TELL YOU. THERE'S A BUCKET OF WATER. PUT YOUR HAND IN IT AND PULL IT OUT. SEE WHAT HAPPENS. IN YOUR HAND YOU KNOW THIS RECOVERY IS NOT IN THERE. IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU IT'S ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION THAT GOES. FOR AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'VE TRIED TO CONDUCT MYSELF HEARING IN THAT LINE I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE TIME TO SAY. PUBLICLY BECAUSE I'M SURE THEY'RE WATCHING THIS SOMEWHERE -- MY CHIEF OF STAFF MICHAEL O'HANLON -- HE'S BEEN INSPIRATION WITH ME HE'S BEEN WITH ME FROM THE BEGINNING. I FOUND HIM AS A A GUY RUN AROUND THE DISTRICT NEGROES TO BE MY CHIEF. VERONICA BUT DELIA WHO'S BEEN WITH ME.

AND SOFIA HERNANDEZ -- SHE WAS WITH ME FROM THE BEGINNING AS AN INTERN IN THE HOUSE BEEN THERE SIX YEARS. I JOKE AROUND WITH THEM BECAUSE HERNANDEZ GARCIA BUT DEALIO CHAVEZ.

YEAH SO THAT'S OF THE PEOPLE THERE THAT HAVE DONE ALL THAT I WANT TO LIKE TO THANK -- STEVE MCCARTHY OVER IN POLICY SPEND SO MANY HOURS WITH HIM AND WHAT HE'S DONE.

I WON A HIGHLY READY BECAUSE IT'S GOES TO THAT STORY THE BUCKET. AND THE WATER IS NOT ABOUT US. YOU KNOW WE COME WE MAKE A STATEMENT WE MOVE ON BUT IT'S ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS INSTITUTION THAT GOES FORWARD. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT ALL THESE OLD PEOPLE ON THE WALLS HERE THE USED TO BE SPEAKERS AND I THOUGHT THERE'S SOMEBODY. THEY'RE NOT ANYMORE [inaudible] IN SO [inaudible] IN SUMMATION. WHEN WE DO THINGS HERE HAVE A LONGER VIEW? IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT US. IT'S ABOUT THE STATE NOW AS WE GO FORWARD. AND NOW I'M IN THE LAST PERSON LIKE TO THANK. IS MY WIFE MARY MARY WOULD ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT I'D GET OUT OF THE HOUSE SHOULD MAKE SURE I HAD A WATER BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAD THESE TERRIBLE LITTLE.

AND SHE'S BEEN HERE AND AND SHE SAID I CAN'T COME BACK HERE EVER AGAIN. AND I'LL JUST SEND IT WITH THIS. I'LL BE BACK IT'S CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I REQUEST UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO SUSPEND THE RULES TO ALLOW AUTHORS TO TAKE UP THE FOLLOWING BILLS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE FOR THE PURPOSE. OF CONCURRENT THE SENATE AMENDMENTS THOSE BILLS ARE AB SEVEN FORTY EIGHTEEN AB SEVEN TWENTY FOUR CHOI AND AB NINETEEN NINETEEN WOULD [inaudible] WITHOUT OBJECTION THE CLERK WILL READ. AS I WILL SEVEN FORTY EIGHT ICE ON MEMBER TING ACTUALLY PEACE OFFICERS. VISITING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU ARE MISTER SPEAKER. MAYBE A SEVEN FOUR EIGHT ALLOWS A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO WITHHOLD A VIDEO OR AUDIO RECORDING OF THE CRITICAL SAFETY AGENCY DEMONSTRATES THE DISCLOSURE. WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE INVESTIGATION FOR FORTY FIVE DAYS. A SUBSEQUENT THIRTY DAY DELAYS IF THE MATTER IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. AMENDMENTS TAKE UP THE REQUEST OF C. H. P. IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL TO ONLY. WHEN AN OFFICER DISCHARGES THEIR FIREARM OR INSTANCES OF USE OF FORCE RESULTING? IN DEATH OR GREAT BODILY INJURY. AGAIN THIS IS A TRANSPARENCY MEASURE. TO REALLY GIVE OUR COMMUNITIES GREATER CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE'VE SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS UP AND DOWN THE STATE IN ALL OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. TO DEPLOY ON BODY CAMERAS WERE SPENDING MONEY TO RECORD THEIR FOOTAGE OF THIS WOULD PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY A STATEWIDE BASELINE OF POLICY. POLICY DOES NOT GO AS FAR AS THE LOS ANGELES POLICE COMMISSION POLICY. JUST ALREADY -- IN TRYING TO IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IT ALSO DOES NOT IMPACT. A POLICY THAT THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO HAS ALREADY ADOPTED -- THIS IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT MATTER IT PROVIDES A GREATER INSIGHT AND GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON IT ACTUALLY DOES NOT FORCE ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. TO RELEASE THE INFORMATION WALL THE ISSUE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION COULD ONLY ASK THAT THEY TELL US. PACIFIC WE WHY THERE'S A GREATER INTEREST IN KEEPING A PRIVATE VERSUS ON RELEASING IT TO THE PUBLIC WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR RIVAL FOR AB. SEVEN FOR A BAKER WAS SHOOTING MISTER LACKEY YOUR RECOGNIZE. YES BIGGER MEMBERS UP TO AVOID GROUNDHOG DAY. I I JUST WOULD OUST YOU RECALL MY REMARKS AND I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY. MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN FOUR EIGHT THIS BILL IS A GOOD BILL. THIS BILL ACTUALLY PROTECTS OUR MEN AND WOMEN AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM SPEECH JUST CLAIMS. IT LIMITS LIABILITY AND SAVES MANY OF OUR CITIES FROM THE EXORBITANT COSTS OF ACTUALLY DEFENDING SUCH CLAIMS. AND AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDINGS THAT COME FROM BODY CAMS CAN ACTUALLY BE EXCELLENT TRAINING RESOURCES FOR THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE ENTERING INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS BILL ACTUALLY PROMOTES TRANSPARENCY THAT WE NEED WHILE OFFERING VERY NEEDED. LAW OFFICER SAFETY -- IT IS FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE THAT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB. SEVEN FORTY EIGHT THEY CAN HAS COME UNDER THAT. THIS CAREER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB. SEVEN FOUR EIGHT AS A FORMER JOURNALIST I CAN TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. TO HAVE. THE FOOTAGE OF BODY CAMERAS AVAILABLE AND I THINK WHAT WE CAN LEARN IS THAT WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY NOW. IN WHICH WE HAVE INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. AND THE INFORMATION THAT IS GIVEN TO THE PUBLIC IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THAT INFORMATION. IN ANY FOOTAGE THAT IS SHARED. HELPS OR SOMETIMES DOES NOT HELP -- SHAPE PUBLIC OPINION. IN A TIME IN WHICH WE WANT THE COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENTTO SEE EYE TO EYE. AND HAVE A COMMON GROUND CONVERSATIONS. WE NEED TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION BE AVAILABLE AND TRANSPARENT. SO THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS FAITH. THAT THE PROCESS IS MOVING FORWARD IT ALSO HELPS MEDIA ENSURE THAT THEY'RE TELLING THE STORY. THEN NEEDS TO BE TOLD AND UP IS AWARE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH CERTAIN CASES THAT HAVE GONE. ON A NATIONAL LEVEL AND HAVE NATIONAL PRESENCE SO I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT BILL THE AUTHOR HAS CERTAINLY. TALKED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HAS COME TO AGREEMENTS IN WHICH HAVE ALSO -- CREATED MORE OF A A PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF AND LONGER PERIODS OF TIME IN WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN REVIEW. AND RELEASE INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC WHICH WOULD ALLOW JOURNALISTS TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE STORY THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD AND INFORM THE PUBLIC. SHAPE OPINION SO WITH THAT I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST IN MY BOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CARILLO. THIS OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION ASK YOU TO OUR A. B. SEVEN FORTY EIGHT I THINK THE ADVENT OF BODY CAMERAS HAS CREATED. A VERY SERIOUS AND SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE. WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIVACY BOTH OF THE PUBLIC AND OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL AND I WELCOME. THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THOSE RECORDING SHOULD BE RELEASED. HOWEVER I THINK THAT THAT HAS TO BE A VERY LIBERTE DELIBERATE DISCUSSION CERTAINLY VERY COMPLEX TOPIC WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- INTERESTED PARTIES AND WHEN WE TRY AND JAM THROUGH THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION LEYVA SESSION MISTAKES HAPPEN AND UNFORTUNATELY. THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION HAS A VERY SERIOUS DRAFTING HERE AND IT AND I WANT TO READ YOU FROM THE BILL WITH YOUR PERMISSION MISTER SPEAKER. WITHOUT OBJECTION OF THE BILL SAYS IF DISCLOSURE WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY INTERFERE WITH AN ACTIVE CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION. THE AGENCY SHALL PROVIDE IN WRITING TO THE REQUESTER THE SPECIFIC BASIS FOR THE AGENCY'S DETERMINATION THAT DISCLOSURE WHAT'S SUBSTANTIVELY INTERFERE WITH THE INVESTIGATION. AND PROVIDED THE VIDEO OR AUDIO RECORDING. THEREAFTER THE RECORDER RING RECORDING MAY BE WITHHELD BY THE AGENCY FOR FORTY FIVE CALENDAR DAYS. SO I THINK THAT WAS MEANT TO SAY AND WITHHOLD. THE VIDEO OR AUDIO RECORDING BUT IT SEEMS TO SAY THAT. THEY DENY THE REQUEST. THEY TELL THE REASON WHY THEY'RE DENYING REQUEST AND THEN THEY HAVE. TO PROVIDE THE VIDEO AUDIO AND THEN WITHDRAW IT SO -- I THINK THESE DRAFTING ERRORS ARE INDICATIVE OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN WOULD AMENDMENTS GET PUT THROUGH AT THE LAST MINUTE. NOW WE NEED TO BE MORE DELIBERATE ABOUT THIS AND GET IT RIGHT AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE OR I I KNOW WHAT BIGGEST OBERNOLTE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS -- I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THE BILL CLEARLY STATES THE BODY CAM VIDEO MUST BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS THE AGENCY CAN PROVE THAT THE DISCLOSURE WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY INTERFERE WITH THE WHILE INVESTIGATIONS ARE OCCURRING RELEASES COULD POTENTIALLY TIP OFF POTENTIAL SUSPECTS A PROVIDE THE SAME. WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADJUST THEIR STORIES TO COINCIDE WITH THE RELEASE VIDEO LET'S NOT INTERFERE WITH THE ONGOING LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS. LET'S VOTE NO IN AB SEVEN FOR A BACON IS WALDRON. SEEING AND HEARING OTHER REQUEST TO SPEAK MISTER TING YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU IT'S SPEAKER -- WITH OUR RESPECT TO THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT WE'VE WORKED ON THIS BILL YOU'LL NOTICE NUMBERS AB SEVEN FOR A THIS WAS A AYE TO YOUR BILL -- WE NEEDED TO TO YOUR BILL AND LAST SESSION -- SPAIN GREATER TIME TO LIBERTY DISCUSSING THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE -- WE HAD NUMEROUS -- DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS REINFORCED WE WEREN'T ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT BUT DESPITE -- NOT A BE ABLE TO REMOVE ALL OPPOSITION WE DID SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWED THE BILL AGAIN -- TO SPECIFICALLY USE BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE ONLY IN THE USE OF FORCE AREAS -- DO APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR MATCHING THE DRAFTING NEAR THE DRAFTING AREA WAS ACTUALLY -- DONE DURING AMENDMENTS IN JUNE SO AGAIN IT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT LAWS ARE DONE LAST LAST WEEK OR YESTERDAY. UNFORTUNATE A LEAD THE ERROR WAS ONLY BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION A COUPLE DAYS AGO AND WE WERE NOT ABLE TO MAKE AMENDMENTS IN TIME BECAUSE OF THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR ROLE. WE ARE SUBMITTING A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL WHICH WAS SUBMITTED ON AUGUST TWENTY NINTH AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM FIGURES CORRECT -- THE LEGISLATION SHOULD READ PROVIDE THE ESTIMATED DATE. FOR THE DISCLOSURE OF THE VIDEO OR AUDIO RECORDING -- AGAIN IT'S SOMETHING THAT BECAUSE WE HAD DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION THE PETITION FOR THE LEGISLATION IS NOT UNTIL JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN I SHOULD THE BILL PASS AND BE SIGNED. THEN WE WOULD ANTICIPATE BRINGING CAR CLEAN UP LEGISLATION VERY EARLY NEXT YEAR WITH AN URGENCY BECAUSE TO HELP. GET THAT -- GET THAT TO IMPLEMENTATION SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. SEVEN FOR A THANK YOU MISTER KING THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE.

IT TAKES ALL KINDS TO FILL A FREEWAY. YOU NO WHICH IS A VERY CALIFORNIA EXPRESSION FOR JUST A VARIETY [inaudible] OF LIFE. AND I THINK -- I CAN ASSURE YOU ALL. THIS IS PROBABLY MY FORTY FIRST. LAST NIGHT OF SECTION. IN MY CAREER THAT I'VE BEEN AROUND [inaudible] THERE'S ALWAYS. BIG PERSONALITIES IN THIS BUILDING. THERE'S ALWAYS PEOPLE WERE SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE. THERE'S ALWAYS PEOPLE WHO TEST THE BOUNDARIES. AND YET THIS IS THIS GREEN CARPET. THAT WE TALK ABOUT. FOR WHICH YOU ALWAYS HEAR PRIVILEGES TRAVIS ALLEN. WHEN THE GREEN CARPET? WHERE WE COME AND TRY TO WORK ON THE FUTURE TOGETHER? AND I THINK -- WE'RE IN AN ERA CERTAINLY WIN THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS IN ITS MEANING OF BEING TEST. AND WHAT IS MOST ASSUREDLY IS A TIME IN WHICH PEOPLE COME TOGETHER KIND WORK ON THE FUTURE. WITH DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS WE REPRESENT. FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. ALMOST FORTY MILLION PEOPLE VERY DIVERGENT VIEWPOINTS. AND THERE IS AN ERROR IN THIS INSTITUTION WHEN IT WAS EASIER FOR MEMBERS ACROSS THE AISLE. TO WORK THINGS OUT. I REMEMBER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AFTER ALL OVER PRINT EARTHQUAKE. KEN MATTER WILLIE BROWN MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE SPEAKER IN THE ASSEMBLY. DID A HANDSHAKE DEAL. TO RAISE TAXES TO REBUILD OUR STATE. BECAUSE IT WAS MOST OFFICIAL WAY. TO MOVE WITH ALACRITY. AND BUILD A BETTER FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIANS. I JUST WANT TO SAY. YOU KNOW YOU. YOU PROBABLY TWIST PEOPLE'S TAIL MOUNT AGAINST MY FIRST BOSS LIKE TO SAY [inaudible] BUT A THIS CHALLENGER JUST KIND OF WORKING TOGETHER. RECOVERING THE MEANING OF THIS INSTITUTION. BUT WE ALL REPRESENT DIFFERENT VIEW POINTS. AND TO TAKE US BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF RESPECTED EVERY MEMBER HERE. FOR THE CONSTITUENCIES WHO REPRESENT FOR THE VIEW POINT TO REPRESENT. I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT REPRESENT GOVERNMENT. IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE REPRESENTATIVES IT'S FINDING REPRESENT OF IDEAS. AND FOR THIS WE JUST NEED ALL OF THESE DIVERSE VOICES WHO WAY AND TO HELP US FIND. A WORKING CENTER. SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO IN OUR DELIBERATIONS TRYING FIND A WORKABLE CENTER. AND EVERY VOICE MATTERS. EVEN THOSE THAT SORT OF MAKE A SMASHER TEETH THAT. BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE HERE. THAT I DO THINK YOU REPRESENT ON ASPECT OF OUR DEMOCRACY THAT IS PRECIOUS TO US ALL. THAT WE BRING OUR CONSTITUENCIES HERE WE ADVOCATE FOR THAT WOULD TRY TO FIND A WORKABLE CENTER. AND HOPEFULLY WE EMBODY THE IDEALS OF WHAT. TO FOR OUR DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT [inaudible] AND I DEFTLY FEEL THAT WHAT WE DO HERE CALIFORNIA. IS IMPORTANT THE NATION PORT OF THE GLOW -- NOT JUST BECAUSE THE SIZE OF OUR ECONOMY BECAUSE THE SIZE OF OUR IDEALS. AND IT REMAINS TRUE IS THE WRITER THE BOOK OF PROVERBS SAID SO LONG AGO.

AND CONGRATULATE YOU BECAUSE IT IS VERY HARD TO PUT YOUR NAME ON THE BALLOT. INTO TRYING REPRESENT DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES OF A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN YOUR DISTRICT AND WHILE. OUR VIEWPOINTS ARE PROBABLY QUITE OPPOSITE IN. THERE'S NO SURFING IN MY DISTRICT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE FOUND THE BUDGET ISSUES THAT WE AGREE UPON. I THINK ANYONE WHO PUTS THEIR NAME ON THE BALLOT ATTEMPTS TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE THERE DISTRICT -- DESERVES -- TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED -- AS YOU ALL KNOW THE SEATS ARE I HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED'S. IN THE SCHEMEOF THINGS ONLY A FEW. ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE. HAVE SAT IN THE SEATS AND YOU CAN COUNT YOURSELF AMONG THEM. AND HOPEFULLY YOUR CHILDREN WILL REMEMBER THAT AND PERHAPS THEY TOO WILL ASPIRE TO SERVE IN THE VERY SEATS WHERE THEY ARE SITTING RIGHT NOW -- YOU I RESPECT YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE AND NOT BEING AFRAID. TO OFFER A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WAS FAR FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- BUT IT SAYS A LOT THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO SAY. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON WHO WOULD GET UP TO SAY. AND NOT TO PUT YOUR NAME ON THE BALLOT. AND RUN FOR STATEWIDE OFFICE IS A HUGE HUGE -- CHALLENGE AND IF YOU TOOK THAT ON AND YOU GOT OUT THERE AND YOU JUST KEPT ON GOING TO BLOW OUR DISCOURSE.

THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE -- IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE VINEGAR WILL SERVE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA IT'S A QUICK STORY. WHEN I FIRST GOT IN -- SPEAKER JOHN PEREZ WAS OUR SPEAKER. I THINK SHE'S GOT A HUNGRY TIRED RIGHT NOW. SPEAKER JOHN PEREZ WAS SPEAKER AND HE WAS A BIG GUY IN LITERALLY EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD. CAST A SHADOW ENTIRE BUILDING.

AND IN JOHN YOU CHOOSE CREDIT WAS VERY VERY CIVIL VERY TACTFULLY CEO. OR TO TALK BUSINESS LUNCH BUT YOU SEE. I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN MUCH OF A POLITICIAN AND I HAD NO IDEA OF THE SUBTLETY YOU CAME WITH BEING THE SPEAKER.

AND AS JEANS GALLAGHER POINT OUT I THINK I VOTED NO TO ME TIMES I'VE I'VE YOU BROKEN THE BUTTON OFF MY DESK. BUT I WILL TELL YOU. THERE ARE MANY VOICES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE REPRESENT I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE'S FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS. THAT NEVER GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVEN KNOW WHAT GOES ON HERE THEY THEY'RE SO FAR REMOVED FROM POLITICS THEY DO SEE THE NET EFFECT OF OF WHAT WE DECIDE APPEAR. IN THE REASON IRAN WAS VERY SIMPLE I BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS BALANCE AND I STILL FEEL THAT VERY STRONGLY.

BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING VERY SIMPLY THIS WAS NEVER MY LIFE'S ASPIRATIONS BE IN POLITICS THIS WAS NEVER DREAM OF MINE. MY DREAM WAS SIMPLY NEED YOU RIGHT IN THE WORLD AND AFTER I DID YOU MEASURE SUCCESS IN BUSINESS I UNDERSTOOD THE DIVIDE MEAN GIVEN MUCH THAT MUCH WOULD BE EXPECTED.

OF MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS SB FORTY SEVEN PROHIBITS POSSESSION OF ANIMAL TROPHIES AND OTHER BODY PARTS IN ELEVEN ICONIC AFTER ENDANGERED SPECIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EARLIER EARLIER THIS YEAR WE LOST SUDAN THE LAST MALE NORTHERN WHITE RHINO. SUDAN IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF A LARGER TREND PACING MANY OF THE MOST ICONIC AFRICAN ANIMALS. SAVANNAH ELEPHANTS POPULATION TO DECLINE BY 30% BUT 200-072-00014 AFTER ALLIANCE HAVE DECLINED BY THREE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY BLACK RHINO POPULATIONS. HAVE DECLINED BY 97%. EVIDENCE IS MOUNTING THAT TROPHY HUNTING IS NOT BENEFICIAL TO CONSERVATION. STUDIES SHOW TROPHY HUNTING IS LINKED TO POPULATION DECLINES IT ALSO SUB STUDIES ALSO SHOW THE EFFECTS OF TARGETING MATURE MAINLY MALE ANIMALS CAN DESTABILIZE A POPULATION. AND REMOVE IMPORTANT GENETIC MATERIAL. NOT ONLY ISSUE ACCOUNTING NOT BENEFICIAL TO THE SURVIVAL THE ANIMAL POPULATIONS BUT DOES NOT PROVIDE NEARLY THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OTHER FORMS OF THE CULTURE TOURISM DO. IN FACT CHOPPY HUNTING BRINGS IN LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN TOURISM SPENDING TO EIGHT COUNTRIES THAT WERE STUDY AT A SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. ANNUALLY AND TOURISM PENDING OR JUST ZERO POINT 78%. EVEN WORSE JOB HUNTING IS WILLING TO INCREASE POACHING ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING IS THE FOURTH MOST LUCRATIVE CRIMINAL INDUSTRY WITH THE VALUE ESTIMATE BETWEEN SEVEN AND TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR. ALL THESE REASONS BE ENOUGH TO WARRANT ACTION BUT ACTIONS TAKE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO WE CAN CONSERVATION EFFORTS MAKE WHAT WE DO HERE IN CALL CALIFORNIA EVEN. MORE IMPORTANT. OVER THE LASTYEAR THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY REMOVED A BAN ON IMPORTATION OF ELEPHANT AND LIE AND TROPHIES. S. B. FORTY SEVEN HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND IS SUPPORTED BY MANY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ANIMAL WELFARE ADVOCATES. AND OF THE EVEN. TODAY WAS FURTHER CLARIFIED NOT THAT. THE GOAL HERE IS TO STOP THE IMPORTATION. OF THESE TROPHIES AYE AND TO TARGET THOSE THAT ARE. REMOVING THESE PRODUCTS INTO OUR COUNTRY. IN ANY CASE I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE -- MEASURED I WANT TO THANK SENATOR STERN FOR AUTHORING. BIGGEST CALLER THIS FRIEDMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU -- MISTER SPEAKER I WAS ACTUALLY NOT. THE BILL TODAY BUT AFTER READING THE BILL IN BEING VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT SOME ASPECTS OF THE BILL I WANTED -- TO ADDRESS YOU AND TOP TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD WITH THE BILL'S AUTHOR WHEN THIS BILL CAME UP IN COMMITTEE I HEARD AND COMMITTEE. AND HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. FOR ONE THING THE GOALS OF THIS BILL ARE EXTREMELY MERITORIOUS YOU KNOW I HAVE A YOUNG DAUGHTER AND I WORRY EVERY DAY THAT I WILL ONE DAY HAVE TO TELL HER THAT THOSE BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS THAT SEE SEASON BOOKS. DON'T EXIST ANY LONGER. BUT YOU CAN'T SEE THEM IN THE WILD THAT MAYBE THERE'S ONE OR TWO LEFT IN ZOOS BUT THEY ARE ALL PRACTICALLY. FOR ALL INTENSIVE PURPOSES OFF THE PLANET THAT MIGHT SEEM. FAR FETCHED BUT THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF POACHING RIGHT NOW. BUT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE BILL AND THE REASON I WAS WORRIED IS BECAUSE OF SOME OF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS BUT AFTER I HAD MY CAREER IN THE FILM INDUSTRY I BECAME AN ANTIQUES DEALER. AND ICE THE DEAL IN ANTIQUE INVENTED STORY. AND SOME OF THAT VINTAGE STORY IN FACT QUITE A LOT OF IT OCCASIONALLY WILL HAVE IVORY AND OTHER TYPES OF MATERIAL AND BECAUSE THE BILL BANS POSSESSION. I WAS AFRAID ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. IF SOMEBODY IF SOME OVERZEALOUS PROSECUTOR STARTED TO GO AFTER. SOMEONE FOR THEIR GRANDMOTHER'S BROOCH. AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WASN'T THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND THAT COULDN'T HAPPEN IN THE BILL. BUT I ALSO DIDN'T WANT A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE HAD TO PROVE THEMSELVES THAT THEY HAD. OWNED A PIANO WITH IVORY KEYS FOR TWENTY YEARS OR THIRTY YEARS. I HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION SAY WITH THE BILL'S ADVOCATES IN THE BILL'S AUTHOR THAT CERTAINLY WASN'T ITS INTENT AND HE WAS WILLING TO PUT A LETTER INTO THE FILE WHICH HE DID. TO CLARIFY THAT NUMBER ONE IT WOULD BE IT WAS HIS INTENT THAT THE AND BURDEN OF PROOF WOULD BE ON THE PROSECUTORS ON THOSE WHO WANT. TO REST PRESS CHARGES AGAINST SOMEONE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PROVE. THAT THE ITEM WAS NOT OWNED FOR MANY YEARS AND SECONDLY IT WAS ALSO NOT AS INTENT TO HAVE PROSECUTION OVER DIMINISH THIS SMALL AMOUNTS OF THE MATERIAL SUCH AS YOU WOULD FIND IN VINTAGE JEWELRY. THAT LETTER IS NOW IN THE FILE AND NEXT YEAR I'M COMMITTED TO DOING A BILL TO CLARIFY THIS. SO THAT THE LAW IS A LITTLE BIT CLEARER AND DOESN'T LEAD TO THE OVERZEALOUS PROSECUTION OF SOME. ANTIQUE MALL OWNER WHO HAS A TEENY PIECE OF JEWELRY IN A SHOWCASE BUT CERTAINLY NOT AN IMPORTER OR SOMEONE WHO EVEN WOULD KNOWINGLY PUT THIS MATERIAL OUT FOR SALE. WITHOUT I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL RITE NOW AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE TIME IS RUNNING OUT. FOR THESE AMAZING AN ENDANGERED ANIMALS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BIG IS FRIEDMAN MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. SO I WANTED TO RISE BECAUSE I I SHARE MANY OF THE SAME CONCERNS -- THAT THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FROM GLENDALE THAT HAS POINTED OUT -- THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY WELL INTENTIONED. ONE AND I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WOULD PROBABLY AGREE WITH THAT INTENTION. THE ISSUE IS ABOUT HOW BROAD. THIS THIS BILL REACHES AND THOUGH I UNDERSTAND THE COMMENTS -- FROM MY COLLEAGUE. A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL DOES IT REALLY DO THAT. AND MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS COULD GO AFTER PEOPLE RETROACTIVELY COULD GO AFTER PEOPLE. WHO MAY BE IN POSSESSION OF JEWELRY OR SOME OR A BROOCH OR SOME KIND OF THING THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED? UNDER THIS BILL AND FACE PROSECUTION. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S JUST. AND THE OTHER POINT THAT I WOULD BRING UP THAT I THINK IS OFTEN LOST IN THIS DISCUSSION IS. THAT MANY OF THE HUNTERS. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR THE GREATEST CONTRIBUTORS TO CONSERVATION EFFORTS IN AFRICA THAT ARE PROTECTING THE SPECIES TODAY. AND SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GROUPS LIKE SAFARI CLUB INTERNATIONAL YOU TALK ABOUT MANY OF THEIR MEMBERS WHO. WHO ARE HUNTERS? BUT WHO ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THEY'RE NOT POACHERS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE IS WITH POACHERS THAT'S WHO WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. AND WHO ARE LEADING TOO THE DECIMATION OF SPECIES. IT'S NOT WITH RESPONSIBLE HUNTERS WHO ACTUALLY HAVE CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE. TO THE CONSERVATION OF THE SPECIES [inaudible] AND SO. YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. AND AS WELL AS NOT EVERY SPECIES. UNDER THIS BILL IS A THREATENED SPECIES SO AGAIN THE THE ALL THE SPECIES THAT ARE COVERED BY THIS BILL. IS NOT TARGETING THE MOST ENDANGERED SPECIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO AGAIN I THINK THAT THAT WE NEED SOME MORE WORK ON THIS BILL IT CAN WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR. AND I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE SO THAT WE CAN GET THIS RIGHT IN THE NEXT SESSION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER. MR MAKES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU IT'S INTERESTING ACTUALLY FINDS OF A FIND MYSELF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN. OF THE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM FROM GLENDALE AND AND MY COLLEAGUE HERE IN FRONT OF ME. I AM I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THIS EVENING BUT I DO THINK THAT IT ACTUALLY. NEEDS SOME SOME MORE WORK AND THE TRUTH IS OF THE ELEVEN ANIMALS THAT ARE ON I THIS LIST NINE OF THEM ARE -- THREATENED AND I THINK ITS IMPORTANT FOR US FOR THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN. I DO THE BIT THE LITTLE BIT THAT WE CAN A TO BE ABLE -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT KILLING ANIMALS THEY SHOULDN'T BE SHOULD BE KILLED WHILE I UNDERSTAND -- I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER THE AS THE CITY. THAT NECKLACE LIKE AS IT MY TO SEE BIEBER BUT THAT IS -- THAT IS MY OTHER OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES. THE FINE MEMBER FROM EAST NICOLAS. WHAT WHILE I AGREE WITH HIM I DO THINK THAT LED TO THE JOURNAL? THREE GALLAGHER THIS ONE REMIND THE GENTLEMAN -- FROM COACHELLA. DID NOT EVERY OTHER MEMBER NOT EVERYTHING NORTH OF THE TEHACHAPI IS. IS THE SAME. MISTER GALLAGHER THAT POINT IS. WHILE TAKING A MR DAYS I'D NOTE THE OUR AND THAT THE AGENDA THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US THIS EVENING PLEASE CONTINUE. I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO SAY. ANYWAY I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL THIS EVENING BUT IT DOES NEED SOME MORE WORK AND I'M GONNA WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM GLENDALE I'M NEXT SESSION IN AN EXPEDITIOUS MANNER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE. TO TO FIX AFTER A FEW OF THESE LITTLE LOOPHOLES THAT THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND THE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES SEEING HEARING NO FURTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK MISTER KALRA YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER IF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OUR DONE BICKERING WITH ONE ANOTHER.

EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY SEVEN I KNOW THAT MADE EVERYONE TURN AROUND I KNOW [inaudible] AND DON HAYS ME BRAUDEL HAZMI. I LOVE SPORTS BUT FOR ME MAYBE. NINE EIGHTY SEVEN HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT BUILDING A SPORTS ARENA. MOSTLY BECAUSE I AM A BULLS FAN. IT HAS BEEN ABOUT THOUSANDS OF JOBS AND ECONOMIC EQUITY FOR INGLEWOOD AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES THAT I AM PROUD TO REPRESENT. YET THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATE OF THE ARE PRIVATELY FUNDED FACILITY. TEN THOUSAND CONSTRUCTION JOBS ONE THOUSAND PERMANENT OPERATIONAL JOBS AND A VERY STRONG LOCAL HIGHER PREFERENCE ENSURING THESE JOBS COME TO AND STAY IN OUR COMMUNITY. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR MILLIONS IN POTENTIAL PUBLIC REVENUE FOR PARKS LIBRARIES MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH ACCESS AND OTHER SERVICES CONTRIBUTING TO OUR COMMUNITIES QUALITY OF LIFE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DIRECT AND INDIRECT ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES. ALL WHILE TRANSFORMING ACRES OF VACANT LAND THAT'S BEEN BLIGHTED FOR YEARS AND SITS DIRECTLY UNDER THE LOS ANGELES FLIGHT PATH WHICH IS NOT SUITABLE FOR MUCH ELSE. I WANT TO THANK MY INGLEWOOD COLLEAGUES ESPECIALLY ASSEMBLY WOMAN BURKE AND THOSE FROM THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES FOR THEIR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE PROBABLY THE VERY TIRED LABOR LEADERS AND COMMUNITY RESIDENTS WHO ARE HERE TODAY IN THE GALLERY AND IN THE BACK. THIS BILL DEMONSTRATES THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DO NOT NEED TO BE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE IN FACT WITH THIS BELL I DARE SAY WE ARE SETTING A NEW GOLD STANDARD FOR GREEN STANDARDS. AB NINE NINETY SEVEN REQUIRES OUR PROJECT TO MEET THE SAME STRICT ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS HAS MANY OTHER PROJECTS UNDER SEEK WHAT AND OTHER STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL STATUTES. IT REQUIRES A FULL AND COMPREHENSIVE III OUR LEAD GOLD CERTIFICATION A NET ZERO ENERGY STANDARD WHICH IS THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION 15% REDUCTION IN VEHICLE TRIPS. A TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT PLAN ENTRANCE OF DESIGN AND ASSISTANCE. ON SITE AND LOCAL MITIGATION A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT INTO A MISSION REDUCTION SOLAR ROOFING AND ENFORCEABLE METRICS TOWARDS ADMISSION GOALS. I'M TIRED JUST THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT INGLEWOOD WILL GET FROM THIS BILL. I CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR OF ALL OF THE COMMITTEES THAT THIS BILL HAS GONE THROUGH ESPECIALLY THE CHAIR OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. FOR MAKING THIS BILL CLEANER GREEN STRONGER. SO WITH A HUMBLE HEART. I ASK YOU TO JUDGE THIS BILL ON THE MERITS OF ITS TANGIBLE BENEFITS FOR INGLEWOOD AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. I UNDERSTAND THAT SEQUEL GIVES PEOPLE HEARTBURN A ON THIS FLOOR. AND IT HAS CHALLENGES AND NEEDS TO BE PART OF A LARGER MORE DELIBERATIVE STATEWIDE CONVERSATION. BUT THIS BILL IS ABOUT FIXING ECONOMIC DISPARITIES IN ONE PART OF OUR STATE. NOT FIXING EVERY PROBLEM EVERYWHERE. AND WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW THE PERFECT TO BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. FOR MANY OF YOU IN THE WAY IT. DOESN'T TOUCH OUR DISTRICT PROBABLY NOT EVEN CLOSE. AND YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING HOW IS THIS GOING TO HELP YOU. BECAUSE MOST OF US COME HERE TO FIGHT FOR OUR OWN DISTRICTS. BUT WE'RE OFTENTIMES VOTING ON ISSUES THAT HAVE A LARGER IMPACT. AND THIS BILL WILL. THIS BILL IS ABOUT JOBS IN JOB SAVE FAMILIES. THIS BILL WILL CEMENT THE HOME OF AN NBA FRANCHISE. INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS ON THE PRECIPICE OF REVITALIZATION. AND IT WILL CREATE AN ECONOMIC MULTIPLIER EFFECT. THAT WILL HAVE INGLEWOOD. SEE THAT KIND OF TAX REVENUE BASE THAT IT NEEDS AND DESERVES. TO TACKLE THE ISSUES THAT IT FACES AND THOSE ARE INTEGRATED. AND MANY OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE HAVING. EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY SEVEN HAS ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS -- AND WHILE I AM CERTAINLY INTERESTED AND BUILDING MAKING SURE THE ARENA GETS DEALT TO COME TO INGLEWOOD.

SOME SIMILAR SEQUENCE STREAMLINING FOR THE AMAZING SACRAMENTO KINGS HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND AND WE'VE SEEN THIS BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN ONE ARENA JUST DOWN THE STREET. AND I KNOW WE'VE. DONE THIS FOR THE WORLD CHAMPION GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS. I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT RIGHT BUT INGLEWOOD. ENGLEWOOD IS ALWAYS UP TO NO GOOD. AND EVEN HOLLYWOOD. HASN'T GOTTEN THIS KIND EXEMPTION. AND SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE IS IF YOU COULD PLEASE JUST MAYBE SPECIFY HOW THIS CHANGES. THE CURRENCY. PROCESS.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE THIS EVENING TO PRESENT S. B. NINE NO ONE ON THE FIRE. WILDFIRE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE REPORT. A BEFORE I BEGAN I WANTED TO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THE CONFEREES FROM THIS HOUSE WHO DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB. IN TERMS OF NAVIGATING THROUGH SOME VERY CHALLENGING AND VERY COMPLICATED. SUBJECT MATTER. FIRST I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE -- FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER. WHO HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB IN TERMS OF HIS SUPPORT AND HIS GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF MANY ASPECTS OF WHAT WE HAD TO DELIBERATE OVER? SAMBAR TO DO YOU KNOW. YUCCA VALLEY AND HELD. FOR EACH OF THESE MEMBERS HAS CONTRIBUTED A GREAT DEAL OF INSIGHT IN THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AS IT RELATES. TO THEIR COMMUNITIES BURNING. AND IT WAS VERY INSTRUCTIVE IN TERMS OF GIVING US GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF HOW WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT TO THE FORE. AS WE ALL KNOW THAT. WE STARTED THIS PROCESS RECOGNIZING THAT [inaudible] CALIFORNIA. HAS BEEN UNDER A DROUGHT CONDITION FOR MANY YEARS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS IMPACTED. ON THE EFFECTS OF ARE STATE IN A VERY DRAMATIC WAY. THIS YEAR NEARLY A MILLION ACRES IS BURNED. AND NOT ONE OF THOSE FIRES BECAUSE BY UTILITIES. BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE SAW DRAMATIC IMPACT ON OUR STATE. FROM FIRES IN THE NAPA VALLEY COMMUNITY. AND IN VENTURA COUNTY. AND AS A RESULT OF THOSE FIRES THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR LIABILITY. THAT HAS BEEN A DRIVING FORCE OF CONVERSATION TO BEGIN THIS YEAR. WHEN WE STARTED THIS YEAR? WE HAD A NUMBER OF UTILITIES ACTUALLY ALL THE UTILITIES PRIVATE. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE CAPITAL MANY OF THEM TO YOUR OFFICES TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT. THE FIRE WAS HAVING ON THEIR OPERATIONS ON THE POTENTIAL THEIR BUSINESS AND THEIR OPPORTUNITIES TO BE SOLVENT AND CONTINUE TO OPERATE. AND AS WE MADE OUR WAY THROUGH HEARING A LOT OF THE KIND OF COMPLICATED ISSUES AND THINGS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE. IT KIND OF BOIL DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY AND MANY EFFORTS AND CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE OUR LEADERSHIP. IN BOTH HOUSES IN OUR GOVERNOR TO MAKE STATEMENTS TO TRY TO CALM MARKETS AND TRY TO CALM FEARS. BUT IT BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY NEEDED TO GET ITS ARMS WRAPPED AROUND. THIS IN A VERY [inaudible] DRAMATIC WAY. AND SO THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED BY BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND WE WILL COME TO YOU TONIGHT. WITH OUR FINDINGS [inaudible] THIS REPORT. IS BUILT ON THE FOLLOWING GOALS. TO ENSURE RECOVERY FOR FIRE VICTIMS. STABILIZE UTILITY IN THE MARKET TO PREVENT ADVERSE REPAIR IMPACTS DUE TO INCREASE BECAUSE OF FINANCING. AND POSSIBILITY OF BANKRUPTCY. IMPROVE GRID SAFETY IMPROVE VEGETATION AND FORESTRY MANAGEMENT. THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE REPORT ALSO ADDRESSES THE MERIT OF ISSUES WITH THE CORE FOCUS ON PREVENTION TO REDUCE WILDFIRES IN THE ELECTRICITY. ELECTRIC UTILITY AND REPAIR IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH WILDFIRES. THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE FRAMEWORK MAKES COMPREHENSIVE CHANGES TO STRIP AND FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES SUCH AS VEGETATION. VEGETATION REMOVAL INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE AND UTILITY COMPANY INSPECTIONS. IT'S CRITICAL TO NOTE THAT NOTHING IN THE REPORT WILL CHANGE THE TRIAL COURT PROCEEDINGS WHICH CONSIDER DAMAGES FOR WHILE FIRE VICTIMS. BUT IT WILL ENSURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE THERE TO COMPENSATE THOSE VICTIMS. THIS REPORT INCORPORATES THE SAFETY MEASURES CONTAINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JULY PROPOSAL. EXPAND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS HARDENING SUCH AS UNDER GROUNDING AND INSULATION WIRES AND PULL REPLACEMENT. SPANS WILDFIRE PLAN REQUIREMENTS FOR PO USE BY REQUIRING PLANS FOR ALL WILDFIRE RISK CIRCUMSTANCES NOT JUST THOSE FOR CATASTROPHIC FIRES. REQUIRES PO USED TO CONSIDER SAME MEASURES AS REQUIRED FOR THE IOUS. THIS REPORT MAKES VARIOUS CHANGES INCREASE ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PRIVATE AND FEDERAL LANDS TO REDUCE FIRE RISK. REQUIRES WHEN THE STATE PURCHASES DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS TO CONSERVE FOREST LANDS AND THOSE LANDS ARE ACTIVELY MANAGED INCREASING THE PACE AND SCALE OF ACME ACRES TREATED. SMALL LANDOWNERS WILL BE GIVEN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND REGULATORY RELIEF TO CONDUCT FUEL TREATMENT. ON THEIR LANDS. SPECIFIED FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS ON FEDERAL LAND. WHERE THE STATE PROVIDES FUNDING OR STAFF USING THE GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY WHICH ONLY? WE'LL ONLY BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE NEPA INSTEAD OF BOTH SEE CORPS AND NEPA. LANDOWNERS WILL BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP LIFETIME TIMBER HARVEST PERMITS TO MANAGE THEIR LAND. FOR THE LONG TERM. THIRTY SECONDS HOLDEN REALLY WELL. JUST IN CASE WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE TIME MISTER HOLDEN WILL GIVE YOU A MINUTE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE EVEN BETTER. LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT THERE'S A GROUP THERE IS A THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTOOD. THAT THERE IS A GOING FORWARD. AS WELL IS A RECOGNITION THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FIRES NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED. THIS REPORT ALSO RECOGNIZES MENDIS MUCH ACETO BECAUSE OF THE FLOODS NEEDED TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS CALCULATION. IT GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR THERE TO BE A CAP. ON THE ON THE UTILITIES TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CPUC TO REVIEW. AND THEN PROVIDE A STRESS TEST BUT THE IDEA IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DRILL DOWN AND AND ENSURE THAT THERE IS A ADEQUATE AMOUNT. OF STAKEHOLDER INVESTMENT AND THEN THAT WHICH WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR RATEPAYERS. TO RESPOND TO WOULD BE COVERED UNDER STE UNDER -- FINANCING PLAN. GOING FORWARD WE'RE CHANGING THE RULES TO ALLOW FOR THE CPUC TO NOT PROVIDE FOR STRESS TESTS BUT ALLOW FOR THEIR BE OPPORTUNITY. TO GO FORWARD AND TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT. WILL ALLOW FOR THE CPUC CREATING DIFFERENT STANDARDS ALLOWING A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR UTILITIES TO BE EVALUATED UNDER. THERE'S ALSO A MUTUAL AID THAT IS INCLUDED IN THIS. LOW INCOME AND VERY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS WOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM THIS. FROM THE A TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SEVENTEEN AND GOING FOR PROPOSAL. THIS WAS IT HAS IT BUILT INTO IT WORKER PROTECTION. AND IT ALSO PROVIDES FOR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BLUE RIBBON COMMITTEE TO BE PRESENTED. TO REVIEW ADDITIONAL ISSUES THAT THIS COMMITTEE WAS NOT ABLE TO FULLY VET. THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER REMARKS. AS WE PROCEED BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER HOLD IT. MEMBERS WERE GOING TO WORK RIGHT TO LEFT WILL GO WITH MISTER MAYES AND I'M GOING TO WORK MY WAY ACROSS THE ROOM [inaudible] MISTER MAYES. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER A MEMBERS I KNOW AT THIS LATE HOUR THE LAST THING WE WANT TO HEAR IS -- MORE SPEECHES BUT I DO THINK THAT FOR THIS. LEGISLATIVE SESSION THERE IS NO ISSUE. THAT WAS AS INTENSE AS THIS ISSUE. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIRMAN OF HAVE YOU ANY FOR ALL OF HIS WORK ON THIS ALSO THE CHAIRMAN OR THE CO CHAIR. OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. THERE ARE MANY OF US HERE IN THIS CHAMBER WHO WORKED FOR MONTHS. ON THIS THEIR WAS INFORMAL WORKING GROUP [inaudible] THAT MATT. WEEK AFTER WEEK AFTER WEEK STARTING THIS THERE'S A MORE FORMAL GROUP THAT MET. WEEK AFTER WEEK AFTER WEEK STUDYING THIS AND I WAS ON BOTH OF THOSE WORKING GROUPS AND ALSO ENDED UP SERVING. ON THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AS WELL. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS ISSUE. IS EXCEPTIONALLY COMPLEX. BEFORE YOU THIS EVENING. THERE IS A CONFERENCE REPORT AND I DID NOT VOTE FOR THIS CONFERENCE REPORT ON TUESDAY EVENING BECAUSE THE LAST MINUTE. LANGUAGE BEFORE US I WASN'T COMFORTABLE AND I HADN'T SEEN IT YET. BUT I RISE AT THIS EVENING TO TELL YOU THAT I SUPPORT THE CONFERENCE REPORT. IT IS NOT PERFECT. IF YOU ARE A PROGRESSIVE THERE ARE. ISSUES INSIDE OF THIS. REPORT THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO VOTE ON IF YOU'RE A CONSERVATIVE. THERE ARE THINGS HERE THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WANT. TO VOTE ON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US CAN FIND PROBLEMS IN THIS REPORT AND YOU CAN FIND AN EXCUSE. TO NOT VOTE ON IT. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE. IN GOVERNING IF YOU BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE THAT OUR RESPONSIBILITY HERE IS THE WORK TO TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIANS. THEN I THINK WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US THIS EVENING. IS A MEASURE THAT WE CAN ALL. SUPPORT IT IS NOT PERFECT. BUT IT IS GOOD. I DO BELIEVE IT NEEDS SOME PIXIES. AND WHEN WE COME BACK NEXT YEAR FOR THOSE OF US. THAT WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY COME BACK WE CAN WORK TOGETHER THOSE FEW FIXES. BUT BEFORE US THIS EVENING. IT IS A GOOD MEASURE. AND IT IS WORTHY OF YOUR YES VOTE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THING MISMANAGED DOCTOR WOULD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS -- THIS ISSUE IS DEEPLY PERSONAL TO ME. THE TUBS FIRE. RAVITCH MY DISTRICT. FORTY FOUR PEOPLE DIED. OF FIVE THOUSAND HOMES DESTROYED. HUNDREDS OF BUSINESSES DESTROYED. I'VE LIVED THIS EVERYDAY SINCE OCTOBER NINTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND I WILL LIVE THIS FOR THE YEARS TO COME AS WE STRUGGLE TO REBUILD THE FABRIC OF OUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BILL. BUT IT IS THE BEST WE CAN DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. I HAVE FOCUSED ON FROM DAY. ONE THE VICTIMS. THOSE WHO DIED. THOSE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES AND NEED TO REBUILD. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL STRIKES THE BALANCE TO HELP US TO MOVE FORWARD. I DON'T WANT TO SEE FUTURE VICTIMS AND THAT'S WHY HAVE FOCUS SO MUCH ON THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. I THINK MOST OF THE CONVERSATION HERE TONIGHT. IS ABOUT WHETHER THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE. BUT I DO LINE IN THE SAND WHEN I SAID WE NEEDED TO PUT PEOPLE FIRST. AND BY THAT I MEAN VICTIMS. AND THOSE WHO MIGHT BECOME VICTIMS IN THE FUTURE. BUT PREVENTION HAD TO BE A PART OF THE OVERALL SOLUTION. TO ME THAT MEANS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCES FOR OUR FIRST RESPONDERS OUR FIREFIGHTERS. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS PACKAGE DEDICATES ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS. EACH YEAR THAT MEANS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR EFFECTIVE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR PER FRIES PRESCRIBE FUEL AND FUEL REDUCTION PROGRAMS. THERE IS ALSO FUNDING TO ALLOW FIREFIGHTERS TO PRE POSITION IN ORDER TO BETTER RESPOND TO FIRE. AND DIRECTION FIRE SIZE AND DIRECTION. THIS REPRESENTS WOULD THE LARGEST COMMITMENTS TO FIRE PREVENTION IN THE STATE'S HISTORY AND IN MY OPINION IT'S LONG OVERDUE. ADDITIONALLY THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES IN THIS BILL WILL ENCOURAGE LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BETTER PLAN FOR WILDFIRE AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR LANDOWNERS TO CONDUCT FUEL REDUCTION ON THEIR OWN LAND. SPECIALLY LA SMALL SMALL LANDOWNERS. I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE PACKAGE STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN MAKING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AFFORDABLE. AND PROTECTING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES BUT MAKE MAKE NO MISTAKE. AS A PROUD ENVIRONMENTALISTS I WILL WORK CLOSELY. I WON'T TOLERATE ABUSES. IN CLOSING WE CAN'T STOP THE SEVERITY THESE WILDFIRES WITHOUT DEALING WITH THE CAUSES. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. CAN REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF THE FIRES. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT ONE MAJOR FIRE OFFSETS ALMOST EVERYTHING THE STATE DOES. WHEN WE GO TO TO TRY TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS ON A YEARLY BASIS? THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION COLLEAGUES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THEY COULD ACT WOULD MISS LEVINE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE EFFORT. OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE BUT I MUST RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WELL THERE ARE IMPAIR MANY COMMENDABLE PROVISIONS REGARDING FIRE PREVENTION. INCLUDING INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN BETTER VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. THIS DID NOT NEED TO BE JOINED TO THIS BAIL OUT. IT STILL LEAVES UTILITY RATE PAYERS. ON THE HOOK. ON THE HOOK FOR HUGE COSTS DUE LARGELY. TO UTILITY NEGLIGENCE MEMBERS THE WORD NEGLIGENCE. DOESN'T EVEN APPEAR IN THE BILL WHICH IS INDICATIVE OF HOW LIMITED IS IT IS [inaudible] IN TERMS A RATE PAIR PROTECTIONS. IN THE MOST CRITICAL SECTION OF THE BILL ON COVERING THE COST OF WILD FIRE DAMAGES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT STATES. THAT THE P. YOU SEE SHALL CONSIDER THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STATUS. IN DETERMINE THE AMOUNT A CORPORATION CAN PAY. WITHOUT HARMING RATEPAYERS ARE MATERIALLY IMPACT IN ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE. ADEQUATE AND SAFE SERVICE. THIS STRESS TEST [inaudible] PROCESS WILL ULTIMATELY DETERMINE HOW MUCH A UTILITY. AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS WILL PAY FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILDFIRE DAMAGES [inaudible] SO. THIS PUTS A CAP THAT COULD WELL PROVE TO BE A DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW. ONE THAT ALLOWS IN THE POUND SIGN MAJOR COSTS TO RATEPAYERS TIED. TO UTILITY NEGLIGENCE SO AGAIN IT'S A CAP [inaudible] FOR SHAREHOLDERS. BUT NOT FOR RATEPAYERS. LET'S REMEMBER THAT CAO BUYER HAS FOUND THAT PJ ANY VIOLATED LAWS REQUIRING PROPER MAINTENANCE IN ELEVEN INSTANCES. AND THAT COULD ADD TO THE COST OF LAW LAWSUIT SETTLEMENTS SUMMER THOSE. AFTER THE SAN BRUNO DISASTER THAT DISASTER. WHERE PIPELINE APPEAR GINNY PIPELINE BLEW UP A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE PEOPLE IN THE SANCTITY OF THEIR OWN HOME [inaudible] WERE KILLED. THAT AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN LAWSUITS SETTLEMENTS. WHILE THOSE SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED PER P. GINNY COST RECOVERY FROM RATEPAYERS. NOTHING IN THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY PREVENTS THE STRESS TEST. FROM BEING APPLIED TO PGM EASE FINANCIAL STANDING AFTER. ASSESSMENT PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN APPLIED. AND HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED ITS FINANCIAL STATUS.% I SUCH IN ADDITION TO PAINT REPEATING EASE NEGLIGENCE DIRECTLY. RATEPAYERS COULD BE ON THE HOOK. FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO LAWSUITS. SO ONCE THE IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL THREAT HAS PASSED. SHAREHOLDERS AND WALL STREET UNDERWRITERS CAN RETURN TO THEIR SAFE DEPENDABLE PROFITS WHY RATE PIERCE WILL KEEP WRITING TRACKS. TO PAY FOR DAMAGE THEY DID NOT BECAUSE MEMBERS. WITHOUT A DOUBT THE COST OF OUR CHANGING CLIMATE WILL BE A SHARED. ONE WE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT IN FIRE FIGHTING AND PREVENTION EFFORTS. IT WE WILL SURELY HAVE COSTS FROM FIRES. YET TO COME. COST WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THE COSTS OF NEGLIGENCE SHOULD NOT FALL PRIMARILY ON RATEPAYERS. THE UTILITY AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS NEED TO SHARE RISK. NOT BE CAPPED BECAUSE OF A STRESS TEST THEY CAN'T SOCIALIZE. THE COST OF DISASTER. WHILE PRIVATIZING ALL PROFITS. UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL DOES NOT RESOLVE THAT IMBALANCE. REMEMBER EVEN WHEN CONGRESS BAILED OUT THE AUTOMAKERS. THE AUTOMAKERS PAID THEM BACK. THEREFORE DESPITE. THE PROACTIVE FIRE SUPPRESSION PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL. I ASK FOR A NO VOTE. ON S. B. [inaudible] NINE OH ONE MISTER DALLI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS IN AYE RISE. IS SUPPORT OF S. B. NINE A ONE AND I WANT TO SHARE. WITH MANY OF YOU -- WE'RE HAVING BEEN HERE SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AS YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED ABOUT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. AND THE REST FOR CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRES FROM THE DAY I CAME HERE. AND MAYBE I SPOKE AGAINST BILLS THAT WE WERE USING [inaudible] AND CARBON. AS FOR TRANSPORTATION AS WHERE WE SPEND MOST OF OUR RESOURCES BECAUSE I THOUGHT. WE SHOULD PUT MORE THOSE RESOURCES TOWARDS. EWING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA. WE CAME TO THE POINT LAST YEAR WHERE WE SAW CATASTROPHIC WILD BUYER. OVER FIVE THOUSAND HOMES BURNED DOWN THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION TONIGHT. BECAUSE THOSE FIRES AND NOT A CASES WORK BECAUSE BY UTILITIES. BUT I WILL SHARE THIS WITH YOU. THAT WHAT ONE OUT A TEN FIRES IS STARTED BY UTILITIES. THE OTHER NINE ARE STARTED BY. AUTOMOBILES LIGHTNING MANY OTHER THINGS. I HAVEN'T CHRISTIAN USE A PROP WITHOUT OBJECTION. THIS IS CAL FIRES. FIRE THREAT MAP. IF YOU'RE IN RED. YOU'RE GONNA BURN. I DON'T KNOW NGUYEN BUT YOU'RE GONNA BURN. I SEE A LOT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIVING DOWN HERE. MAYBE A MILLION FROM HERE UP. BUT THAT YOU'RE WATERSHED. THAT YOU'RE WILDLIFE. THAT YOUR FARMS IN THE WHITE IN THE VALLEY THERE. WE BURNED ONE POINT TWO MILLION ACRES JUST THIS YEAR. SEVEN PEOPLE DIED. IN REDDING CALIFORNIA. WHEN A FIRE TORNADO? FIRST TORNADO CALIFORNIA TO KILL SOMEBODY WAS A FIRE TORNADO JEREMY STOKES LOST HIS LIFE. BITING THE SPIRES. NOW WE KNOW ONE THING. FIRE CANNOT BURN WITHOUT FUEL. YOU TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THE FIRE. FIRE KIPPER. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WIN OXYGEN. IF IF IGNITION AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE FUEL. I'VE BEEN ASKING SIX YEARS TO REDUCE. VEGETATION AND FUEL. YOU'RE GONNA BURN IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING FAST. AND I WAS WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS ON MY COMMITTEE. ON THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE HAVE FINALLY. CAME TO A POINT. WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY DO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL REDUCE THE RISK. EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA. IF YOU'RE A HOMEOWNER. IT'S GONNA DRIVE YOUR CHURCH RATES DOWN. IF YOU DRINK WATER. IT'S CAN PROVIDE MORE WATER WE DO VEGETATION NAMES IN THE FORCE. WE'D TO EXPAND ON TOOLS LIKE GRAZING IN THE 300-010-0023 THOUSAND FOOT AREA. ON THE COAST YOU WHO LIVE ON THE COAST. WHERE THERE'S BRUSH? YOU NEED RESOURCES TO DO. MASTICATION IT'S A MACHINE THAT BRUSHES IT DOWN BECAUSE YOU NEEDED TO STAY ALIVE. SO THAT WHEN IT RAINS IT DOESN'T WASH IN THE OCEAN THAT'S WHERE THIS MONEY IS GOING TO BE SPENT. I WON A CIRCLE BACK TO THE UTILITIES AND BUT MY PREVIOUS COLLEAGUE TALKED ABOUT. IT'S NOT PERFECT BILL. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A PERFECT BILL. THE WRANGLINGS THAT WENT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE HOUSES WAS DIFFICULT. BUT I WILL SHARE WITH THIS WITH YOU. TO DO NOTHING. TO DO NOTHING. WOULD BE ON US. WE'VE DONE SOMETHING. IT'S NOT PERFECT. BUT I THINK IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I AM PROUD TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I CAN VOTE. FOR S. B. NINE A ONE BECAUSE I CAN GO BACK TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND ALL OF YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING. WE NEED TO TURN CALIFORNIA FROM RED. BACK TO GOLD GOLDEN STATE LIKE IT IS AND WERE WE HAD A HUNDRED YEARS. A FIRE SUPPRESSION IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE NOT GONNA GET OUT OF THIS SOON. IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME BUT THIS IS A STEP AND I JUDGE WE ACTUALLY HAVE PUT RESOURCES. TO REDUCING CARBON TO IMPROVING WILDLIFE AND IMPROVING. THE AREAS WHERE FIREFIGHTERS CAN GET AND SAFELY. JERRY STOKES Y.. IS HOME WITH THREE CHILDREN. AND HERE HE'S NOT GOING TO BE THERE EVER AGAIN. THE FORTY FOUR PEOPLE IN THE TUBS FIRE THAT LOST THEIR LIVES THE DOCTOR WOULD SIFT THROUGH THE ASHES TO DIGNIFY THEM. TO THEIR GENERAL. THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IS A TOUGH VOTE I GET THAT. BUT YOU CAN GO HOME MANY IN YOU WHO ARE THOSE RED AREAS WHICH IS MOST OF THIS STATE. IN START DOING THE RIGHT THING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER DALLI MEMBERS WILL BE MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION. FROM WE ARE LEFT TO RIGHT MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU -- MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ARISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK ON THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEES THE WORKING GROUPS AND EL ALL IT'S BEEN GOING ON I'M AS A MEMBER FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WANTED TO BE SURE TO RISE TO BECAUSE THIS IS A STATE. WIDE APPROACH WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AS A STATEWIDE APPROACH THAT MAP CLEARLY SHOWS. THAT THIS WHOLE STATE IS AT HIGH RISK -- HAVING JUST GONE THROUGH THE LILAC FIRE. IN MY DISTRICT LAST FALL AND BEING IN A ROOM. IN FALLBROOK CALIFORNIA WHERE WE BROUGHT IN ALMOST A THOUSAND RESIDENTS WHO HAD BEEN EVACUATED FROM THIS ONE PARTICULAR AREA THAT HAD COMPLETELY BURNED. THROUGH A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD. WHERE SENIOR CITIZENS LIVE? PEOPLE IN THEIR UPPER SEVENTIES EIGHTIES AND NINETIES. AND REALIZING THAT OF THAT GROUP HUNDREDS OF THEM WOULD NOT HAVE A HOME TO GO BACK TO BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO. AT THAT TIME WOULD HAVE A HOME AND WHO WOULDN'T AND IT WAS SO DEVASTATING TO BE THERE IN THAT AND THE WONDERING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON YOU KNOW LOTS OF CONCERN. THE FIRE SPREAD FIFTEEN HUNDRED ACRES IN LESS THAN AN HOUR BECAUSE ONE THE SAN AND THE WINDS BLOW IN MY AREA THERE'S NO STOPPING IT. AND WITH THE VEGETATION AND AND YOU KNOW WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO GET AHEAD OF THESE THINGS AND WITH FIRE BREAK SOME PLANNING. WHERE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THAT AGAIN WE'RE MOVING INTO FIRE SEASON WHEN I GO HOME AND I'M DREADING WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BRING WHEN THE SANTA ANA WINDS START TO BLOW -- ARE UTILITY COMPANY SAMPRAS THE GENIE HAS DONE A AND CREDIBLE JOB OF KEEPING AHEAD OF IT. THEY'VE -- YOU KNOW WE'VE ALL LEARNED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FROM THE BIG BLAZES THE WHICH CREWS IN THE CREEK FIRE THE WAY HE'D OF FIRE IN THE COCOS I COULD GO ON AND ON BECAUSE EVERY FOUR YEARS WE SEEM TO HAVE ANOTHER. BIG FIRE -- WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LET THE SESSION GO AND NOT START TO TAKE THIS. AND AND MOVE HEAD WITH THAT WE NEED TO START IT'S A GOOD START -- WE CAN AFFORD TO GO THROUGH OTHER FIRE SEASONS IN YEARS OF NOT TAKING CARE THIS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. AND SOME OF THE OTHER DEALS WITH THE UTILITIES ORIGIN I'VE. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON DOCTOR EGGMAN. I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I I'M I WAS NOT A AND ONE OF WAS A PRIVILEGE ERA THAT. AND THE PUNISHMENT TO BE ON THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE -- BUT I WATCHED MOST OF THEM AND I AND I SERVE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND I AM. SOMEBODY HAS BEEN VERY INTERESTED AND INVOLVED IN THIS TOPIC AND I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND AS PEOPLE SAID IT IS NOT A PERFECT BILL AND I DON'T THINK ANYTHING THAT WE EVER DO IN THIS BUILDING IS PERFECT NOR CAN ANYONE ASK US. TO WORK TOWARDS PERFECTION BECAUSE WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS DOING THE BEST WE CAN IN AN INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED ENVIRONMENT. BUT I TELL YOU SOMEBODY WHO LIVES IN THE VALLEY. AND WE'RE ALL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR AIR. AND THE PRICES BAR OF OUR ENERGY THAT WE HAVE HAD TO HAVE OUR AIR CONDITIONING IS RUNNING MORE THAN I HAVE EVER HAD MY PUP MY POWER BILLS HIGHER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE OUR WINDOWS OPEN. BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO SMOKEY AND PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BREEZE. BECAUSE OF THE FIRES THAT ARE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM US BUT THE BUT THE SMOKE COMES DOWN. AND EVERYBODY SUFFERS FROM IT -- AND THERE WAS UP A FEW MEMBERS OF THE OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS WHO HAPPEN TO BE UP IN THE MOUNTAINS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO -- WHEN ANOTHER FIRE BROKE OUT? A AND WE HAD TO BE EVACUATED OUT OF A PLACE -- AND I TALK WITH SOME OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER THAT TIME AND SAID WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED ABOUT. YOU KNOW LETTING PEOPLE KNOW WHEN THINGS ARE HAPPENING. AN OF CHP OFFICER SAID WE'VE LEARNED THAT SOMETIMES THEY MOVE SO FAST THERE'S NO TIME. THERE'S JUST NO TIME. AND AND JUST ONE OTHER ISSUE WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT MUCH IS WILDLIFE. AS WE WERE BEING EVACUATED OUT AND AS WE WERE GOING DOWN DARK ROADS. ALL YOU COULD SEE ON THE SIDES OF THE ROAD WERE EYES OF ANIMALS. HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS WHO ARE RUNNING FROM THE FIRES. TRYING TO FIND SOMEPLACE SAFE AND AND THERE ISN'T ANY PLACE SAFE. SO FOR THOSE ANIMAL LOVERS THINK ABOUT THAT. AND THEN ALSO SAY IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT RATES GOING UP. IF WE DO NOTHING. RATES ARE ARE ARE GONNA GO UP. AND THEN I'LL TALK BRIEFLY JUST AS A SOCIAL WORKER. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO AS A GOVERNMENT WHAT OUR CHARGE IS? IT'S I HOPE WE HAVE PEOPLE TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT. AND TRUST THAT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE THAT WE'RE DOING THE VERY BEST WE CAN. BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHO LIVE IN FIRE DISTRICTS WHO DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO BE SAFE. WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A HOME TO GO TO WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SCHOOLS GOING TO GO ON IN THE MORNING. WHO WHERE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE INSURANCE? THAT LEVEL OF ANXIETY. IT WE CAN'T JUST WISH IT AWAY. IT TAKES ACTION IT TAKES PEOPLE SAYING WE'RE PUTTING PLANS IN PLACE WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE DATA WE CAN IN THIS IS THE BEST THAT WE CAME UP WITH IN THIS AMOUNT OF TIME. AND WE'RE GOING TO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING ON AND THAT WE'RE NOT WALKING AWAY FROM IT THEY WERE TO CONTINUE COME BACK IN THE FALL WE'RE GONNA WORK ON THIS WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT EVEN BETTER WHERE TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THIS. BUT HERE ON THIS LAST DAY OF SESSION THIS IS THE BEST WORK THAT WE'VE COME UP WITH. THAT IS GOING TO BE A HOPE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN RATES. DEEPER UTILITIES IN BUSINESS TO TAKE CARE OF OUR FOREST. AND TO GIVE [inaudible] CALIFORNIANS SOME PEACE OF MIND THAT THERE LEGISLATORS ARE DOING THE BEST THAT THEY CAN. TO PASS LAWS [inaudible] PROTECT THEM. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE MISTER STONE. YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AND FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN. FROM PASADENA BUT THIS TOGETHER AND MINORITY LEADER WHO REALLY WORKED HARD ON THIS DEAL IN THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON THIS. THE DILEMMA THAT I FIND IS THAT WE'VE CONFLATED TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS AND ONE IS. PROTECTING P. GENIES LIABILITY WHICH IS REALLY BACK AND THEN THIS STARTED OUT OF A PANIC. ABOUT PROTECTING P. JEANNIE. ALL ON THE BACK AND WITH REALLY NO TALK ABOUT THE FRONT END WHICH IS EXACTLY THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. THE HARDENING OF THE SYSTEMS ALL THOSE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE TO PREVENT FIRES FROM GETTING WORSE ONCE THEY START BECAUSE FIRES WILL START. I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEING PUT IN HERE. TO GO CLEAN UP SOME OF THESE PROPERTIES BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S DONE THAT. I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT SOME OF THE RELAXATION OF THE RULES. BECAUSE A LOT OF THE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MARKETABLE TREES ON THEIR PROPERTY ARE GOING TO BE HAPPY WITH THAT RELAXATION. AND THEY'RE GONNA CUT. BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO DUE THE FIRE MANAGEMENT THAT WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT THAT WE'RE EXPECTING HERE. IF WE PUT USE YOUR OF MONEY UP FRONT. THEN WE CAN SAY THIS IS WHAT WE EXPECT YOU TO DO WITH THAT MONEY SO I THINK THAT'S MONEY GOING TO BE VERY WELL SPENT. THERE'S ALSO SOME MONEY FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS WE ASK THE FIRE CHIEF WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING FOR THE EXPIRED SEASON THEY SAID. MONEY FOR EQUIPMENT FOR PRE POSITIONING FOR USING THE PREDICTIVE TOOL SO THAT WE KNOW WHERE THE FIRES ARE GOING TO BE STARTING TO HAPPEN. HOW WE CAN KNOCK THEM DOWN BEFORE IT HAPPENS [inaudible] SO. THAT PIECE OF IT. IS ACTUALLY A LOT BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AND I HAVE TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BIEBER WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS HE'S ONE OF THE FEW FOLKS HERE WHO'S DONE LAND USE. AND DONE FORESTRY AND UNDERSTANDS THE PATTERNS IN THE PRACTICES IN THOSE INDUSTRIES AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE JUST LOOSEN UP REGULATIONS OR IF WE FIND A WAY TO GET PROPERTY OWNERS DO THE WORK THE WAY WE EXPECT THEM TO DO. BUT WE'VE ALSO CONFLATED THIS WITH THE LIABILITY FEES AND AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN VERSE AND LIABILITY IN ALL THAT THAT HAS BEEN. A MECHANISM. TO GET MONEY INTO THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO BE REBUILT AFTER THE FIRE THAT'S REALLY WHAT THAT IS. AND INCOME INVERSE CONDEMNATION THE THE THESE RULES A KATYUSHA RULES THAT APPLY TO PGD BECAUSE IT'S IT'S SORT OF IN BETWEEN A PUBLIC ENTITY IN THE PRESIDENT. HE GETS THE BENEFIT OF BEING THERE [inaudible] IT MONEY. GUARANTEED RAIDER TURNED BUT THE THE DOWNSIDE TO THAT. TO THEM IS HAVING TO TAKE ON ALL THIS RESPONSIBILITY AND STUPIDLY FUN ON THE SHAREHOLDERS. THEY'RE NOW THEY'VE MADE DECISIONS. THAT HAVE PUT THAT EQUITY THAT SHAREHOLDER EQUITY POTENTIALLY AT RISK. AND THOUGH NOW THE CONFLAGRATIONS OF COST SO MUCH THAT THEY'RE VERY VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THAT REPRESENTS I GUESS WALL STREET IS. AND BONDING AGENCIES AND ALL THAT ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO SURVIVE THROUGH THIS WE HAVEN'T REALLY TESTED AND DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED AND I DO UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE TRYING TO HELP OUT ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A VIABLE UTILITY AFTER ALL OF THIS. BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT IF WE DON'T DO THIS RIGHT. THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE TELLING OUR CONSTITUENTS OF THE END OF THE DAY SORRY YOU GOT BURNED OUT BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR YOU TO REBUILD. THAT'S JUST WHAT WE DEAD. AND IF WE ARE SITTING HERE IN FIVE SIX YEARS SEVEN YEARS FOR FOR OTHERS. AND UTILITIES ARE STILL FLASH AND HAPPY. AND THE RATEPAYERS ARE STILL CONTINUING TO PAY THAT MONEY. THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT US AND SAYING WHAT DID YOU DO. SO I'M VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE BACK END AND THE FOCUS OF THE BACKEND. AND EVEN THOUGH THEIR PROVISIONS IN HERE TO GET PGP HARD TO DO THE WORK UP FRONT. AND I LOVE THEIR ADS TALK THAT WE'RE GONNA DO THIS WE'RE GONNA DO THAT. AND I KEEP ASKING MYSELF WHERE WERE YOU TEN YEARS AGO. AT DOING THE HARDENING IT DOING THE PREDICTIVE TOOLS THAT HELPING US MAKE SURE THAT THESE FIRES DIDN'T GET OUT OF HAND TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN IRRESPONSIBLE ES DE JEANNIE BECAUSE THEY'RE FIRED AND SAN DIEGO. THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT THEY'VE ACCIDENT PRETTY GOOD JOB OF SENDING UP SO WE HAD THOSE EXAMPLES IN CALIFORNIA OF STUDY OF WHAT TO DO FOR A UTILITY. SO YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE ON THIS ON YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO. IT'S SO COMPLICATED WITH CONFLATED SO MANY THINGS IN HERE THIRTY SECONDS REYES DOWN DIFFICULT TO TO KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE GOING TO BE AROUND FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS IF WE DO PASS THIS. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO NGUYEN AND AND COOP ACT IF NECESSARY MONEY TO GET BACK TO OUR RATEPAYERS. TO HOLD PGD ANY OTHER UTILITY ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING SURE THEY'RE DOING THEIR PART IF WE'RE GONNA DO OUR PART BY PUTTING THE MONEY ON THE TABLE AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE DOING VEGETATION AND FORESTRY MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION WERE WORKING WITH A LOT OF UNKNOWNS INCLUDING NOT EVEN KNOWING WHAT THE RATE ISSUE IS WITH PGD BECAUSE WE DON'T SEE THEM OR SHARE WITH US THEIR FINANCIALS. SO IT'S VERY HARD TO KNOW WHAT. WHAT THE UPSIDE IS WHAT THE DOWNSIDE IS [inaudible] SO. GOOD LUCK IT'S AFTER TEN THIRTY WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME AND WE HAVE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISIONS I THINK THAT WE HAVE FACED IN A LONG TIME. AS MR STONE SAID WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME [inaudible] SO WE'RE WE HAVE THREE MORE MICROPHONES TO MORE MICROPHONES UP AND THEN A CLOSE MISTER VOEPEL. HOW GOOD VAST MISTER SPEAKER? ALRIGHT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S THE BACK AT WE HAVE TO DO IT TO SOME GREAT EXTENT. BUT THE REASON I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL IS THE FRONT END. NEXT SESSION THERE ARE SOME POSITIVE THINGS WE CAN DO FOR THE FUTURE ONE OF THEM IS HAVE THE POWER COMPANIES THE FOUR MAIN ELECTRICAL POWER COMPANIES ESTABLISH A JOINT POWER AUTHORITY. SO THE TAKEN PRE FUND SOME OF THESE CLAIMS. WITH THAT JOINT POWER AUTHORITY THEY CAN ALSO ADD RE INSURANCE FOR CATASTROPHIC CLAIMS. SO THERE PREFONTAINE THAT ESTABLISHES THE RISK FOR WALL STREET THAT ESTABLISHES THE RISK LEVEL FOR THE STOCKHOLDERS IT JUST BECOMES. A PART OF DOING BUSINESS NUMBER. TWO THE INSURANCE SERVICES ORGANIZATION I SO THEY'RE THE ONES THAT DETERMINE ALL THE FIRE AREAS AND BASICALLY DETERMINE LEVEL ONE THROUGH FOUR HOW MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR YOUR INSURANCE PREMIUM. THEY'VE BEEN TRACKING THESE FIRES SINCE. NINETEEN FIFTY AND THE I ALSO AREAS ARE SET UP TO PROTECT INSURANCE COMPANIES. WE CAN LOOK AT THAT. IT'S SEE ABOUT REDOING THE I SO AREAS THAT COULD SAVE A LOT OF MONEY. ANOTHER ONE IS FAIR PLAN FINANCING THAT'S RUN BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S OUR INSURANCE COMPANY BASICALLY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE PUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR WHATEVER NUMBER EVERYBODY COMES UP WITH. THAT WOULD ESTABLISH THEIR RISK. THAT WOULD LOWERED THEIR PREMIUMS AND IT WOULD GIVE THEM A BASS LINE THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY INSURER THESE PEOPLE THEIR END OF RED AREAS THEN LASTLY. SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC HAS AN INCREDIBLE SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING. THEIR GRIT. THEY'VE OF STAB US CAMERAS INFRARED ANOTHER TECHNOLOGIES TO DETECT FIRES THROUGHOUT THE GRID. THAT ALLOWS ANY SECTION OF THE GRID TO BE POWERED DOWN. FOR FIRE LIGHTENING ANOTHER THREATS ASUS ESTATE. HAD THAT SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE A OF WEATHER CENTER. AND THE LAST TOUR THREE FIRES THEY'VE BEEN ABLE. TO PAY HIM NAYLA SO THE FIREFIGHTERS CAN GO IN THERE AND SAFELY PUT OUT THE FIRES AND IF THERE'S LIGHTNING HER BIG STORMS. THEY CAN SHUT DOWN THEIR POWER PART OF THE GRID WALLAH YOU DON'T HAVE ANY. POWER DRIVEN FIRES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ENGLISH VOEPEL MS RACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AS A MEMBER OF THE WILDFIRE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT. COMMITTEES I'VE HAD TO WORK ON THERE ARE SO MANY CRITICAL ISSUES THE FIRST WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED IS. TO MAKE OUR VICTIMS HOLE. THAT WAS NUMBER ONE FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S INVOLVED IN THIS COMMITTEE. WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CONTINUING OUR PATH TOWARDS A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER REDUCING THE FUEL LOAD. AND ALSO PROTECTING OUR RATEPAYERS. WITHOUT A DOUBT THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR CHAIR. SOMEONE MEMBER HOLDEN. AND THE MEMBERS WHO HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN. IT WAS CLEAR THAT THIS WAS NOT GOING TO BE IN THE EASY SOLUTION. I'M VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE. THE DETAILS THAT WE LEARNED THAT WOULD WE HAVE TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS PLAN. AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID THERE WERE THINGS ARE ADDED AND SUBTRACTED. EVERYTHING WAS DONE ALWAYS KEEPING IN MIND WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. IT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID THAT THIS IS NOT A PERFECT A BILL. BUT I CAN UNEQUIVOCALLY TELL YOU. THAT IT'S NOT A BAILOUT. AND THAT IS THE BEST THAT WE CAN PRESENT TO YOU TODAY WITH THE TIME AND THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US. MOVING FORWARD WE KNOW THAT WE ARE INVESTING ONE BILLION DOLLARS IT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. DURING THE NEXT FOUGHT GOOD THEN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. FOR MANAGEMENT FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND GRID HARDENING. IN ADDITION WE ENSURE THAT IN CASE OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES THE UTILITIES WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND FAIR AND JUST COSTS WILL BE EVALUATED. MEMBERS THERE'S PLENTY AT STAKE WITH OUR VOTE TODAY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY. WE HAVE TO LOOK TO THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE. I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN TAKING THIS STUFF. BUT NECESSARY VOTE. TO ALLOW THE VICTIMS. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO MOVE FORWARD. I DON'T I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I DON'T [inaudible] ALL DEBATE. AND DISCUSSION HAVING CEASED. MISTER HOLDEN YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID IT ALL. WE HAVE FOUND OURSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE.

WE WERE AGONIZING OVER THE ISSUES AND IMPACTS ON RATEPAYERS SO JUST LIKE WHAT YOU ALL HAVE HEARD IN WHICH YOU'RE AGONIZING ABOUT TO DIE AS WELL. WE WEREN'T EXACTLY CLEAR THE DIRECTION. WE LEFT HERE ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHICH WAS ACTUALLY [inaudible] WEDNESDAY MORNING. WITH AT LEAST A DIRECTION. IT WAS A HARD POSITION TO FIND OURSELVES IN BUT LIKE MANY OF YOU WHO POINTED OUT TONIGHT. IDEAS THAT YOU BELIEVE NEED TO BE INTEGRATED INTO A PLAN GOING FORWARD. THERE A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. FOR THE PURPOSES OF LOOKING AT THIS. EFFORT INTO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE. A GOOD PLAN. THAT IS AN DURING. AND THAT OTHER IDEAS THAT CAN BE INTRODUCED WE HAVE ANOTHER LEGISLATIVE SESSION. WHERE WE CAN COME BACK AND LOOK AT OTHER ELEMENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT MAY NEED TO BE LOOKED AT? WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US. TONIGHT AS WAS POINTED OUT. REQUIRED A LOT OF HOURS. A LOT OF THE LIBERATION. QUITE FRANKLY A LOT OF ANGUISH. BUT IS WHAT THE IS NINE ONE COMMITTEE.

PARKER WOULD BE WAIVED ONLY IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AND ONLY FOR WORKERS WHO ARE COULD OUR COVERED BY A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT SPECIFICALLY PROVIDES. FOR A GRIEVANCE AND BINDING ARBITRATION PROCEDURE. THIS LEGISLATION HAS IN THE PAST. PROVIDED FOR SPECIFIC STATUTORY WAIVERS. DIFFERENT TO ME TO WE AGREED UPON AND LEGALLY BINDING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. THESE AGREEMENTS PROTECT WORKERS FOR ISSUES SUCH AS OVERTIME PAY. MEALS AND REST PERIODS. SICK LEAVE AND EVEN. THE WORKERS COMPENSATION STATUTES. THESE CONTRACTS WRITER RATIFIED BY WORKERS AND MANAGEMENT PROVIDE A FAIR BALANCE AND PEACEFUL SOLUTION. TO ISSUES IN THE WORD WORKPLACE. BOTH THE STATUTORY AND CONTRACTUAL. MORE THAN HALF A CHECK CENTURY. MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY STATE AND NATIONAL LABOR LAWS HAVE ENCOURAGED THIS PROCESS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES CERTAINTY. TO DISPUTE RESOLUTIONS. THAT IS CRITICAL FOR EMPLOYERS AND AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDE JUSTICE FOR WORKERS WITHOUT LENGTHY AND COSTLY LITIGATION. AB SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR PROTECTS THE PROCESS BY CLOSING A LOOPHOLE IN THE PROGRAM. THAT ALLOWS THE GRIEVANCE. AN ARBITRATION PROCEDURE TO BE SIDESTEPPED OR IGNORED.

ABOUT HIM THAT HE EXUDES EVERY TIME HE OPENS HIS MOUTH. AND SPEAK SO ELOQUENTLY AS HE ALWAYS DOES. EMPLEOS OFF THE CUFF ON SUBJECTS THAT IMPASSIONED HIM. AND WHEN HE CHOOSES TO SPEAK HE SPEAKS THE SAME WAY THAT HE VOTES AND THAT'S WITH A RIGHTEOUSNESS. THAT ALWAYS IMPRESSES ME. AND I THINK IN THE WHOLE YEAR AND A HALF THAT WE SAT TOGETHER I CAN THINK OF ONE TIME THAT WE VOTED IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS PRESS MY MY MY A BUTTON WHEN I WASN'T AROUND -- WITH MY PERMISSION -- BUT BECAUSE WE REALLY SEE AYE AYE ON SO MANY THINGS -- BUT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT HE REALLY -- IMPRESSED HIMSELF ON ME AND MADE AN IMPACT ON ME IS. THE COMMUNIST BY WHICH HE CARRIES HIMSELF. HE DOESN'T GET EXCITED AND HE DOESN'T GET ANGRY [inaudible] HE'S DETERMINED. AND HE'S FORCEFUL WHEN HE SPEAKS BUT HE DOES IT WITH HIS WISDOM. AND NOT WITH HIS TONE. AND EVERY TIME I WOULD WATCH HIM SPEAK I WOULD SIT THERE AND THINK. I WANNA BE JUST LIKE HIM WHEN I GROW UP. SO THANK YOU FOR BEING MY MENTOR IN MY FORMATIVE YEAR.

IN THOSE YEARS SUGGESTS WATER TO ADDRESS HOUSING -- TO ADDRESS THE QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES FOR STATE AND I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT WORK YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE MORE TOGETHER. TO ADDRESS FOSTER YOUTH NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND MONEY FOR SCHOOLS. AND AND I AM THANKFUL TO BE HERE ANY TIME OF THE STATE HAS MONEY AND AND WHAT I WOULD ALWAYS SAY. TO LANA IS YOU KNOW. WHY WOULD WE SPEND THE PEOPLE'S MONEY ON THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST? I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE I NEVER WILL NOW NEVER ACCEPTED. WE TELL OURSELVES NO. EVEN WE HAVE THE DOLLARS TO DO IT AND I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO BE INTERNAL CONTROLS. BUT WHEN I GOT HERE THEY SAID. AS A FRESHMAN THEY SAID TO ME DON'T EVER ASK FOR ANY MONEY. I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE CRAZIEST THING I EVER HEARD MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY PUT ME IN MISS BURKE'S OFFICE WHICH IS NOW. GONNA ASK FOR MONEY. BECAUSE I GREW UP WATCHING IN THE STATE EVERYTHING THAT I CARED ABOUT THE CAT [inaudible] EDUCATION. HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS FOR SENIORS AND SO. I'M HONORED TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE TIME WE ACTUALLY HAVE RESOURCES. TO HELP THOSE WHO NEED HELP THE MOST I'M THANKFUL TO SERVE THESE GREAT COLLEAGUES -- I FEEL AS THOUGH I'M CERTAIN SOME OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE I LEARN SOMETHING EVERY DAY EVERY TIME YOU PICK UP YOUR MIKES.

IN EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU HAS ASKED ME WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GO. TO AN OFFICE THAT NO ONE WANTS OR UNDERSTANDS AND RISK. THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS THAT I COULD SERVE HERE AND I THOUGHT.

IT'S INTERESTING FOLLOWING. MR MY FRIEND MR THURMAN'S A TRIBUTE WITH MY FRIEND MISS CABALLERO DISTRIBUTE. BECAUSE I THINK IT GOES TO SHOW THE GREAT DIVERSITY THAT IS CALIFORNIA -- THURMAN REPRESENTS A VERY URBAN. COASTAL PART OF CALIFORNIA. AND MISS CARILLO REPRESENTS A VERY. RULE PART OF CALIFORNIA. AND YET THEY'RE BOTH DEMOCRATS. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS ABOUT THE STATE THAT IS SO BIG AND SO DIVERSE. AND THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR ALL OF US TO COME WITH ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. SO YOU HAVE ON CABALLERO WHO SERVED THE LIFE OF A PUBLIC SERVICE. I'M IN AN AREA THAT IS NOT NOT ALWAYS BEEN HARD TO REPRESENT. A CHILD OF COPPER MINERS. MOVE TO CALIFORNIA. SHE IS A MOTHER. CHOOSE A WIFE. SHE THE DAUGHTER CAREGIVER OF A MOTHER WITH A LONG TERM ILLNESS THAT. THAT MANY OF US CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE WITH. DISEASE OF ALZHEIMER'S. I I KNOW THE PAIN THAT COMES FROM THAT. SHE WAS AN ATTORNEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA RULE LISTED RULE LEGAL ASSISTANCE. STOOD SIDE BY SIDE WITH FARMWORKERS. YOU START NONPROFITS. AND THEN LIKE MANY OF US AFTER WORKING. ON THE FRONT LINES AND DOING ADVOCACY AND WORKING ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE SIDE BY SIDE. THINK YOU KNOW I HAVE TO DO A PART OF BEING PART OF OF OF GOVERNMENTS TO AND THEN WAS ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THEN. BECAME THE MAYOR OF SILLINESS. AND OF THOSE OF US WHO KNOW YOU COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHANGES YOU FOR EVER IN HOW YOU SEE THE WORLD AND HOW YOU SEE YOUR ROLE. AND THEN FROM THERE CAME SERVED IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I MET ON I WAS AT ONE OF OUR STONE WALL MEETINGS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND WHILE THE SPEECH WAS RUNNING FOR WASN'T EXACTLY WHERE WE LIVED SHE WAS IN THAT CAR AND AND WELL THEY TALK ABOUT THE TRAIN CAUCUS. WHERE WE LIVE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TRAINS GOING THROUGH A LOT OF TIME SPENT IN CARS UP AND DOWN THE NINETY NINE AND UP AND DOWN THE FIVE AND UP AND DOWN? ROADS WHERE THERE'S NO SELF SERVICE A LOT OF PLACES IN -- BUT SHE AND ONE WOULD COME UP AND DOWN AND TALK WITH PEOPLE AND MEET WITH PEOPLE IN. A MINUTE THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED AND RESPECTED ABOUT HER IS HER TENACITY HER HARD WORK -- HER SPEAKING OUT FOR RULE CALIFORNIA. AND FOR THE UNIQUE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE FACE WHEN THEY LIVE WITHOUT RESOURCES AND THEY LIVE WITHOUT CLEAN AIR AND THEY LIVE WITHOUT CLEAN ATER. AND THEY LIVE WITHOUT GOOD QUALITY SCHOOLS AND THEY STILL WANT REPRESENTATIONS ALL OF THE THINGS THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS. AND YET THEY'RE NOT A SIMPLE TO GET. WHEN YOU LIVE IN AREAS THAT ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED AND SO IT IS SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE STRONG ARTICULATE VOICES? TO SPEAK ON YOUR BEHALF AND TO BE ABLE THE HOUSE PASSED LEGISLATION ON YOUR BEHALF AND TO BE ABLE. TO HELP OTHER MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THAT CALIFORNIA'S MORE THAN. THEN THE AND THEN JUST THE COAST THAT IT IT IT IS IT IS IT IS FARMS IT IS FARMWORKERS AND IT IS. THE FABRIC OF THOSE PEOPLE'S LIVES TO HELP MAKE UP OUR STORY IN OUR REALITY. AFTER SHE LEFT THE ASSEMBLY SHE WAS A SECRETARY FOR JOBS AND AND NOT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND THEY CAME BACK INTO THIS CHAMBER STILL NOT STILL NOT DONE SERVING. AND AS A CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I COULD SAY IT IS BEEN AN HONOR TO SERVE WITH ON A CABALLERO WHEN SHE GAVE YOU HER WORD SHE KEEPS IT. AND SHE SAYS SHE'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING SHE DOESN'T. AND WHEN SHE TOLD YOU SHE CAN'T DO SOMETHING IT SHOULD SAY THAT LOT MEMBERS LED MEMBERS THE SESSION WHEN BOTH A LOT OF MY BILLS. NOW. IF SHE WAS HONEST AND SHE WAS UPRIGHT AND SHE NEVER DODGE THAT AND SHE WOULD EXPLAIN TO YOU PERHAPS LONGER THAN YOU WANT TO HEAR. WHY SHE COULDN'T OR WHY SHE WOULDN'T? BUT ALWAYS WITH THE WELL REASONED. WAY TO PRESENT THAT. IN A WAY THAT SHE FELT WAS BEST REPRESENTATIVE OF HER COMMUNITY. AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN ASK ANY MORE THAN A POPE FROM A PUBLIC SERVANT IS TO SERVE WITH HEART. TO WORK HARD TO SERVE WITH INTEGRITY AND PASSION AND NOT BE DONE [inaudible] I HOPE. AND I WILL DO MY ALL I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT. SHE IS ONE OF THE LATINOS ARE GOING TO BE OVER THEY'RE SERVING US IN THE SENATE. ANOTHER WORK DONE IS NOT DONE BUT I CAN SAY THAT EVEN IF SHE WENT HOME TOMORROW. AND THIS WAS IT. HE'S BEEN A WELL LIVED LIFE OF PUBLIC SERVICE THAT HAS NEVER STOPPED AND HAS NEVER WAVERED. FROM THE HARD WORK AND THE DEDICATION. AND I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN. S. PEOPLE WHO LOOK TO HER. FOR HOPE. AND FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO FIGHT FOR THEM. AND FOR THAT FIGHTING SPIRIT AND THAT SENSE OF INTEGRITY AND THAT BRINGING ATTENTION TO RULE CALIFORNIA. A TRIBUTE A PREACHER BTO AND I WILL MISS YOU BUT I WILL FOR EVER CALL YOU MY FRIEND.

YOU DOLLY -- APPRECIATE YOUR HARD WORK. THIS THIS IS NOT EASY TO DO AND WITHOUT YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR FOR ALL OF THAT LEADERSHIP ALSO -- ONE ED. ECHO WHAT MY SEAT MATE SAID IS THAT THERE ARE SOME INCREDIBLE PEOPLE -- CHIEF AMONG THEM IS -- OUR CHIEF CLERK DODSON IN HIS STAFF. WHO ALWAYS ARE THERE FOR US AND MAKE US LOOK GOOD THEY MAKE THIS PLACE RUN AND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR YOUR SERVICE -- AS WELL AS ALL OF THE SECURITY STAFF EVERYONE THAT THAT REALLY MAKES IT POSSIBLE AND I REALLY WANT TO SALUTE MY AND MY STAFF IT'S IN. IT'S IN THE OFFICE -- BECAUSE I I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY OF MY BILLS DONE WITHOUT THEM AND DOT TODAY WAS A CRAZY DAY. WITH ALL OF THE HEARINGS THAT WE HAD OFF THE FLOOR AND THAT IT WAS STAFF WORK THAT. HAD THOSE REPORTS READY THAT HAD OUR BILLS READY HAD IS WITH THE RIGHT FOLDER. AND WITH THE RIGHT BILL AT THAT YOU KNOW RIGHT TIME AND SO -- THANK YOU TO ALL THE STAFF THAT THAT REALLY MAKE US -- LOOK GOOD IN THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO BE HERE. AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT I DOWN THIS IS THIS IS THAT I WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE ASSEMBLY I SAID I WAS A RETREAD. RIGHT SO I BUT IT IF I REALLY HAD IT IS BEEN AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE. TO BE ABLE TO SERVE IN THIS GREAT STATE. AND I FELT HONORED EVERY TIME I WALK IN THIS BUILDING AND I GET THE CHILLS EVERY TIME THE LIGHTS GO OUT IN THIS. ROOM AND WHEN THEY STUDENTS COMING THEY THEY LOOK AND AT OUR NAME PLATES AND THEY SEE THE MICROPHONES AND WHERE WE DO BUSINESS -- IT'S JUST SUCH A IT'S A MAKES ME FEEL VERY VERY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO BE PART OF THAT. EXPERIENCE AND TO BE ABLE. TO EDUCATE AND GET THEM EXCITED ABOUT GOVERNMENT AND SO -- I'VE REALLY BEEN. HONORED TO CHOOSE TO SERVE WITH EVERYONE OF YOU -- I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. THAT. I WILL REMEMBER YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR PARTICIPATION -- WITH GREAT FONDNESS BECAUSE IT ISN'T EASY TO GOVERN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA. IT IS COMPLICATED. AND WE ARE FACING INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES WORLDWIDE. THAT WE NEED THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IF WE DON'T DO IT WELL. THEN WE END UP IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE I WAS HERE WHEN THERE WAS NO MONEY. AND EVERY SINGLE THING THAT I THOUGHT THAT WAS IMPORTANT I HAD TO VOTE CUT. AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE US DO THAT AGAIN. SO WE HAVE THIS TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE OUR ECONOMY IS RUNNING RUNNING THAT. THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND WHAT HAS BEEN GREAT IT'S BEEN ABLE TO SEE YOU ADVOCATE. FOR WHAT YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT. BUT TO DO IT TOGETHER AND IT'S MY EXPERIENCE THAT. THAT IF YOU GET PEOPLE IN A ROOM WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE COMMON VALUES ARE. AT YOU USUALLY CAN GET TO A RESOLUTION AT THE END. AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN GET IN A ROOM AND TALK ABOUT OUR VALUES TALK ABOUT. RAISING CHILDREN TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FOSTER. FOSTER CHILDREN AND SUPPORTING THEM THE IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD pGOOD JOB. SO THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE WITH DIGNITY. THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GET AROUND WITHOUT HAVING TO DRIVE A VEHICLE ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ARE ISSUES THAT. THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS JOB IS THAT I GET TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I REALLY LOVE. AND I WAS NOT RAISED IN RURAL CALIFORNIA I WAS RAISED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RIGHT THERE'S NOTHING ROTH THERE'S A LITTLE BIT GIRL IN SPANISH CALIFORNIA BUT THERE'S NOT A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT. ACTUALLY FIGHT WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THERE WERE A LOT ORANGE TREES ALL THAT'S GONE -- AND THAT'S PROBABLY IT A STORY FOR ANOTHER DAY TO TALK ABOUT IF WE'RE NOT WISE STEWARDS THIS IS WHY LIBERAL CALIFORNIA IS THAT WHAT I WHAT I LEARNED MOVING TO RURAL CALIFORNIA IS THAT HARD WORKING PEOPLE MAKE IT HAPPEN. AND THEIR DEDICATION TO TAKING CARE OF THE EARTH BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU A GOOD CROP IS REALLY COMPLETE AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT GET UP AT THREE O'CLOCK EVERY DAY AND GO OUT TO THE FIELDS AND WORK. AND AND THEY'RE JUST LOOKING FOR A GOOD SALARY A THE ABILITY TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE MOST OF THEM -- CAME HERE LOOKING FOR A BETTER LIFE. AND WHAT I LEARNED OUT OF ALL OF THAT IS THAT THERE IS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE. TO CHANGE THE COMMUNITY AND TO REALLY BE ABLE TO TO DO GOOD THINGS SO THAT THOSE KIDS DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CHANCE IN THE GET A GOOD EDUCATION AND GET A GOOD JOB. BUT IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL. ON THEN WE'RE GONNA LOSE AGRICULTURE AND THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME. AND SO I AM AN ADVOCATE FOR THE PEOPLE. I LOVE THE HARD WORK I LOVE THIS SOIL I LOVE THE THE FEELING OF BEING OUT IN. OPEN OPEN FIELDS -- AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO TO EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT CALIFORNIA AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL LOSING -- SO THAT'S WHY I KIND OF FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT TO BE HERE.
