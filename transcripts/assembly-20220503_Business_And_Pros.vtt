FIFTEEN MILES FROM THE BORDER.

00:44:20.357 --> 00:44:22.393

THAT. NO I THINK THAT'S ACCURATE

00:45:14.144 --> 00:45:15.679
AND IT AT THIS POINT BECOMES

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:17.081
PRIMARILY A COMPLAINT DRIVEN

00:45:17.147 --> 00:45:19.183

00:45:35.732 --> 00:45:37.734

TO RETAIL AND THIS IS A MULTI

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:27.237
PRONGED- ISSUE THAT REQUIRES A

00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:28.805

SPECIFICALLY. SECOND I WOULD SAY

00:48:47.357 --> 00:48:49.192
A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:50.527

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:58.935
SO WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:00.637
SUPPORT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS

00:49:00.704 --> 00:49:03.173
THEY BRING ONLINE SAFE. ACCESS

IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE- BUDGET.

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:34.291
A HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO HAVE

00:51:34.357 --> 00:51:38.762

GOING TO BE IN THE BUDGET. WELL

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.505
I CERTAINLY WOULD HOPE THAT THE

00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:50.207
LEGISLATURE HAS PLENTY OF

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:53.076
AVENUES TO WEIGH IN ON ANY BILL

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:54.478
THAT'S BEFORE THEM. HI IF THIS

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:56.680
IS A THING THAT IS PURSUED IN

00:51:56.746 --> 00:51:58.348
THE BUDGET THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:51:58.415 --> 00:51:59.983
THE BILL AS YOU POINTED THAT

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:01.017
WOULD GO THROUGH THE- BUDGET

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:10.060
ADMINISTRATION STRONGLY SUPPORTS

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:11.862
IS THE ABILITY OF ALL MEMBERS OF

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:12.896

BECAUSE ULTIMATELY I THINK. THE

00:52:14.998 --> 00:52:17.334
IDEA IS TO HAVE A BILL THAT HAS

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.870
RESOUNDING SUPPORT ACROSS THE

I'M AND ONE THING THAT HAS

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.384
SIGNIFICANTLY HELPED- OVER THE

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:45.020
PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS REALLY. I

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.322
IS THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:47.590
DOLLAR LOCAL JURISDICTION

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:48.757
EXISTENCE GRANTS WHICH WILL

01:08:48.824 --> 01:08:50.326
REALLY AIMING TO HELP LOCAL

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:51.894
JURISDICTIONS WITH. A

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.362

WELL AS MEET THIS NET SORT OF.

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:02.171
HI BAR OF SEQUEL. ASSOCIATED

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:04.240
WITH THAT LICENSE I THINK THE

01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:06.141
BEST THING THAT WE CAN

01:09:06.208 --> 01:09:07.877
COLLECTIVELY DO A WHEN IT COMES

01:09:07.943 --> 01:09:09.345
TO ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGERS AT

01:09:09.411 --> 01:09:10.946
CHALLENGES OF ATTAINING ANNUAL

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:13.148
LICENSURE. IS TO LOOK AT THE

01:09:13.215 --> 01:09:14.717
ANNUAL LICENSING PROCESS AND

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.485
FIGURE OUT WHERE WE CAN REMOVE

01:09:16.552 --> 01:09:18.287
DUPLICATION IF APPROPRIATE

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:19.522
BETWEEN LOCAL AND STATE

01:09:19.588 --> 01:09:21.991
LICENSING PROCESS SEES. AND

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:23.526
START TO DO A REALLY DEEP DIVE

01:09:23.592 --> 01:09:25.294
ON HOW WE CAN FURTHER STREAMLINE

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:26.829
THE ANNUAL LICENSING PROCESS AND

01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:28.564
THAT WILL REQUIRE. AYE

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:30.165
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:32.268
IN AND KEEP US IN THE LOOP AS

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:33.769
YOU IDENTIFY SOME OF THOSE

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:34.637
OPPORTUNITIES FOR STREAMLINING

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:37.873
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY- WHAT'S

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:40.376
THAT SPEAKING OF DIE CUT.

01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:42.478
APPLICATIONS AND PROCESSES AND

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:43.979
TIMELINES WHAT'S THE CURRENT

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:45.648
PROCESS AND TIMELINE FOR NEW

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.617
LICENSE APPLICATION. SO I THINK

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:50.152
THAT THAT TIMELINE VARIES

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:52.855
BROADLY- DEPENDING ON THE LOCAL

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:54.890
JURISDICTION PROCESS OF THE

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:56.792
LICENSE TYPE. AND THE

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.827
THOROUGHNESS OF THE APPLICATION

01:09:58.894 --> 01:10:00.863
SO- I'M VERY THOROUGH

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:03.699
APPLICATION OUT WITH A LOCAL

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:06.135
JURISDICTION I THAT HAS THE

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:07.636
ABILITY TO MOVE THEIR PERMITS

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.872
AND SEQUEL PROCESS QUICKLY I

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:11.307
WITH A MORE SIMPLE LICENSE TYPE

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:13.842
IS ANYWHERE FROM SIXTY TO NINETY

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:17.546
DAYS. GOTCHA BUT IT CAN GO UP TO

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:18.681
WHAT'S WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:20.082
HIGH END. WELL WE STILL HAVE

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:21.850
LICENSES WHO ARE IN PROVISIONAL

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:24.219
LICENSURE I SO I THINK THAT

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:26.021
SPEAKS TO THAT QUESTION THERE

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:27.289
ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:30.292
LICENSES SOCKS THAT WERE STOCKS

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:32.094
IN I THINK I WOULD SAY TWENTY

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:34.063
NINETEEN. ARE THAT ARE STILL ON

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.364
PROVISIONAL LICENSURE AND HAVE

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:37.032
NOT YET EIGHTEEN IN IN ALL SO I

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:39.234
CAN BE THAT LONG AND LONGER

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:44.873
GOTCHA THANK YOU. SOME JUDGE I

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:45.841

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.710
CONVERSATION ABOUT FORSMAN AND

01:10:47.776 --> 01:10:49.511
LOTS OF CONCERNS RAISED BY

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:51.313
COLLEAGUES ABOUT FORSMAN MOST OF

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.215

COLLEAGUES RAISED- WHAT I GUESS

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:02.491
