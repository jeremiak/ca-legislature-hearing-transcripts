OKAY YES OKAY THERE YOU ARE THANK THE COOPER FOR THAT GO AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR BELLICUM MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORK COMPLETED BY THE STRIKE TEAM AS YOU KNOW THE STRIKE EAM WAS FORMED BY THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT IMPROVING THE PROCESSING OF CLAIMS AND MODERNIZING THE EDT YOU AYE CLAIMANT EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE. WHEN I LAST APPEARED HERE I PROVIDED YOU WITH A STATUS REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE STRIKE TEAM SINCE THEN WE'VE COMPLETED OUR REVIEW AND DELIVERED OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR. ARE STRIKING REPORT AS WELL AS THE DETAILED ASSESSMENTAND RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC AND ARE NOW IN USE BY EIGHTY D. AS A ROAD MAP. I COULD HEAR THE STRIKE TEAM WITH JENNIFER. A CALIFORNIA AND WELL KNOWN EXPERT IN GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY. THE GOVERNOR AND I ARE GRATEFUL FOR HER DEDICATION TO IMPROVING GOVERNMENT. AND THE TIME SHE CONTRIBUTED AS A CITIZEN OF CALIFORNIA. TO HELP MAKE OUR UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM BETTER. THE STRIKE TEAM ALSO INCLUDED AMY TONG DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WHO IS HERE WITH ME TODAY AND RICHARD RODGERS R. CHIEF DEPUTY. AS WELL AS WE DIE A PATENT IT HAD OF THE OFFICE OF DID OF OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION. WE WERE ALSO SUPPORTED BY AN OUTSIDE EXPERT TECHNOLOGY TEAMS WHO HELPED US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONAL PROCESSES WITHIN EDT. AS OUTSIDE AS WE WERE NOT BURDENED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RUNNING THE PROGRAM DURING A CRISIS INCLUDING BRINGING UP NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS AIMED AT PROVIDING RELIEF DURING THIS PANDEMIC. FOR MOST OF AUGUST WE MET WITH FRONT LINE EMPLOYEES CHALAMET'S MANAGER'S LEADERSHIP STAFF. AS WELL AS MANY LEGISLATORS AND MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF TO BETTER UNDERSTAND PERSPECTIVES ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT EDT AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. THE TEAM VISITED OFFICES AND SHUTTLE MANAGERS AND STAFF AND CITRAL DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT IDENTITY VERIFICATION AN OVERPAYMENT UNITS. AND MET WITH IT SPECIALIST WHO RUN TEN INDIVIDUAL IT SYSTEMS WITHIN EDT. TO UNDERSTAND HOW EACH OF THEM WORKS AND WE'RE CHALLENGES LIE. THE TEAM ALSO SPOKE WITH CLAIMANTS REVIEWED SOCIAL MEDIA AND CHATBOX QUERIES REVIEWED NOTICES REVIEWED CALL CENTER DATA AND LOOK AT IT LIKE TRONIC AND MAIL COMMUNICATIONS SENT BY CLAIMANTS TO AYE TO EDT. THE TEAM OBSERVE PHONE SESSIONS AT THE EDT SERVICE CENTER TO EXPLORE WHERE BREAKDOWNS ARE OCCURRING. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE TEAM FOCUSED ON DATA AT EVERY STEP WE USE DATA TO UNDERSTAND THE PACE OF CLAIMS PROCESSING TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND WORK USE. AS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE PROBLEMS THAT EDT ARE COMPLEX AND MULTIFACETED NEVERTHELESS WE HAVE MADE A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL LEAD TO THE IMPROVEMENT AT EDT IN THE SHORT MEDIUM AND LONG TERM. AS YOU LIKELY KNOW BY NOW WE RECOMMENDED THAT YOU DID THE INSTALL AND IDENTITY VERIFICATION TOOL THAT IS NOW IN USE AND IS MAKING IT EASIER AND FASTER FOR CLAIMS TO VERIFY THEIR IDENTITIES WHEN. FILING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. SINCE IT ME WAS IMPLEMENTED STARTING LAST THURSDAY MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. HAVE USED THE TOOL THROUGH FOUR PM YESTERDAY INCLUDING NICK NEARLY FIFTY NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO VERIFY THEIR IDENTITY WITHOUT NEEDING ANY ASSISTANCE. A LITTLE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE GOT ASSISTANCE TO VERIFY THEIR IDENTITY WITH A TRUSTED REFEREE USING VIDEO CHAT. AS INTENDED THIS IS A SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT MUST BE HANDLED BY MANUAL PROCESSING. IT IS ALSO SLOWING THE GROWTH OF THE BACKLOG BY ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR MANUAL VERIFICATION OF MANY CLAIMS. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THE TOOL IS WORKING TO BLOCK BLOCK INVALID CAIMS AT THE DOOR. BUT MORE DATA IS NEEDED IN THE UPCOMING WEEKS TO MAKE A CLEAR DETERMINATION ABOUT WHY CLAIMS ARE AND AREN'T MAKING IT THROUGH IT. AFTER A THOROUGH ASSESSMENT OF INCOMING APPLICATIONS IS COMPLETED AS WELL AS REMAINING DOWNSTREAM FIXES TO COMPLETE THE AUTOMATION OFIDENTITY VERIFICATION. EDT WILL PROVIDE A REPORT ON THE PROPORTION OF NEW CLAIMANTS WHO ARE GETTING THEIR CLAIMS PROCESS IN AN AUTOMATED WAY. BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST WEEK I'M CONFIDENT EIGHTY D. IS ON A PATH TO MAKE STEPS IN THE PROCESS EASIER FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF APPLICANTS. THE STRIKE TEAM USED TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS WHO WERE ABLE TO EXTRACT DATA FROM PD SYSTEMS TO INFORM OPERATIONS. THIS IS A CRITICAL CHIFFRE ET DE KNOWING WHERE IN THEIR SYSTEM CLAIMS ARE GETTING BOGGED DOWN. AND ADJUSTING STAFF AND OPERATIONS TO ADJUST THEM. WE RECOMMENDED OPERATIONAL CHANGES TO REDUCE THEBACKLOG BASED ON DATA INCLUDING INCREASED USED UP ALL CALLING TO CLAIMANTS TO RESOLVE ISSUES. WE RECOMMENDED A TWO WEEK RESET TO IMPROVE SYSTEMS DURING WHICH CLAIMANTS WOULD FILL OUT AN ONLINE FORM AND BE NOTIFIED LATER OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY. THIS RESET PERIOD WHICH ENDED SUNDAY WILL RESULT IN MANY OF THE CLAIMS DELAYED DURING THIS PERIOD TO BE PAID FASTER. WE SUGGESTED EDT PUBLISHED A NEW DASHBOARD UPDATED WEEKLY THAT CLEARLY IDENTIFIES THE U. I. BACKLOG AND PROVIDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE TIME IT WILL TAKE TO PROCESS THAT BACKLOG BASED ON DATA. I BELIEVE EDG HAS BEGUN MAKING THAT DATA AVAILABLE WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT YOU DO MAKE IT EASIER TO USE YOU AYE ONLINE BY MAKING YOU AYE ONLINE AND ASSOCIATED TOOLS WORK BETTER ON MOBILE DEVICES. FOR INCREASED USE OF THE INCREASE EASE OF USE AND DECREASE USER ERRORS AND DATA ENTRY. ERRORS CAN ACTUALLY CAUSE DELAYS. BUILDING ON THE RECENT IMPROVEMENTS AND DOCUMENT UPLOAD WE ARE RECOMMENDING EDT MAKE IT EASER TO UPLOAD DOCS UPLOAD DOCUMENTS TO THE EDT SYSTEM. USING THEIR MOBILE PHONES OR COMPUTERS TO SPEED CLAIMANT'S ABILITY TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR FURTHER VALIDATION OF THEIR CLAIMS. AND REDUCE THE MAIL PROCESSING BURDEN ON EIGHTY. WHAT THE IMMEDIATE FIXES IN PLACE THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDED THAT EDIE USE DATA DRIVEN EFFORTS TO PREVENT FRAUD AND ABANDON OLDER PROCESSES THAT ARE NOT BASED ON THE MODERN ATTEMPTS TO DEFRAUD EDIE'S PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY WE RECOMMENDED EDT SHOULD REVISIT THE B. S. M. PROJECT AND REIMAGINE IT FOR THE FUTURE IN WAYS THAT PRIORITIZE CLAIMANTS NEEDS AND MAKES THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH ET D. EASY FAST AND RELIABLE. THIS EFFORT DONE IN TANDEM WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION SHOULD BEGIN IMMEDIATELY ONCE THE BACKLOG HAS BEEN RESOLVED. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE CODE NINETEEN EPIDEMIC TRIGGERED AN UNPRECEDENTED VOLUME OF CLAIMS THAT HAS OVERWHELMED THE DEPARTMENT OF SYSTEMS AT ITS CORE. THE DEPARTMENT HAS GROWN OVERLY RELIANT ON A SINGLE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO MUST PERFORM HIGHLY SPECIALIZED TASKS TO PROCESS CLAIMS. IN THE LONG RUN THE DEPARTMENT MUST TAKE STEPS TO SIMPLIFY THAT WORK BY MODERNIZING THE PROGRAM TOGETHER WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT EDT EXPLORE THEIR OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY AND AGAIN BOLD CROSS DISCIPLINARY MODERNIZATION INVOLVING AN OVERHAUL OF ADMINISTRATIVE RULES AND PROCEDURES. OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY WHAT THE CENTRAL FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE FILING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO RESULT IN LOWER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS TO TAXPAYERS IN THE DELIVERY OF THESE BENEFITS. GOING FORWARD THE STATE WILL NEED HYBRID ECH POLICY TEAMS TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS TO ASSESS AND IMPROVE SYSTEMS BRINGING TOGETHER THE WORLD'S OF REGULATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND PROGRAMS TOGETHER WITH OPERATIONS TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS TO BETTER SERVE CALIFORNIANS. I BELIEVE THE STRIKE TEAM HAS HELPED EQUITY D. WAS THE NEW TOOLS AND NEW APPROACHES TO IMPROVE OPERATIONS AND ATTACK THE BACKLOG WITH MORE TRANSPARENCY AND A STRATEGIC APPROACH THAT WORKS PROCLAIM ITS EMPLOYEES MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVES ALIKE. THEIR NEW DATA AND PROCESSES IN PLACE AS WELL AS A TRANSPARENT METHOD OF REPORTING THAT WILL ASSIST YOU AS LAWMAKERS ALONG WITH THE SECRETARY OF LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO SUPPORT BDD AND MAKING PROGRESS. I AM EXTRAORDINARILY PROUD OF THE PACE WITH WHICH THE TEAMS HAVE COLLABORATED FROM THE RAPID COMPETITIVE COMPUTER MEANT OF THE PROCUREMENT OF THE ID VERIFICATION VERIFICATION TOOL TO A SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. MANY HARDWORKING DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS HAVE WORKED AROUND THE CLOCK LITERALLY IN RECENT DAYS. TO BRING UP THESE IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT EDT AND I AM SO VERY PROUD OF THEIR WORK. WITHIN MY AGENCY THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRIMARY RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSON ALSO ONE THANK YOU AND LOTS FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE YOU'VE BEEN- VERY COMMUNICATED WITH ME SO I APPRECIATE THAT NEXT UP. IS MISSILE YOUR. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU BUT WE'LL SEE YOU. UP OKAY HOLD ON. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YEAH WE HEAR YOU BELIEVE WE'RE SEEING THIS RICHARDSON STILL JUST TALKING AND THEN IT'LL- NEED TO KEEP TALKING KEEP TALKING YOU'RE FINE ALL RIGHT OKAY LET'S GET STARTED I GET AFTERNOON A- GERMAN GOVERNMENT COOPER THE REMAINING FOLKS IS BECAUSE I'M GLAD TO BE HERE AGAIN AND YOU AN UP. LIKE I DID LAST TIME I PROVIDED SORT OF A SLIDE DECK OF THE MOST- THE CURRENT INFORMATION- ANNA AND RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I KNOW OUR INTEREST THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SO HOPEFULLY HAVE ADDRESSED OR CAPTURED EVERYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IF NOT WE'LL BE GLAD TO TAKE BACK ANY ADDITIONAL. CONCERNS OR NEEDS AND BE SURE TO GET BACK TO IT AT A LATER DATE SO HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU THE- FLIGHT DECK WE SENT. OVER AND GOING TO FIRST PAGE AND FOR OF. NOTHING OFF OR SECRETARY RICHEST LEFT OFF AROUND THE STRIKE TEAM ARE. I'M TO READ ON THE WORD OF A ALLOW RECOMMEND. OF THOSE RECORD WE'VE ALREADY COMPLETED TWENTY TWO OF THEM THIRTY SIX ARE IN PROGRESS AND THE REMAINING FIFTY THREE YEAR UNDER EVALUATION AND- WAITING DEPENDENCIES AS SOME OF THE OTHER PROJECTS. NOW WE ARE MEETING WEEKLY WITH THE LABOR AGENCY AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO REPORT THE STATUS OF THESE PROJECTS AND- LET THEM KNOW WE'RE ACTIVITY UPDATES- ANY CONCERNS- WHEN SURE THAT WE ARE BEING ACCOUNTABLE AND- GETTING THROUGH ALL OF THESE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS AS SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE. I'M ALSO GLAD TO REPORT- INDUSTRY TO REPORT ITSELF IF IT'S HOT FOR- RECOMMENDATIONS- THREE OF THEM WE'VE ALREADY COMPLETED WHICH ONE IS DEALING WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DASHBOARD- THE DEPLOYMENT OF I'D ME. ADOPTING A BURN DOWN PLAN OF THOSE THREE HAVE ALL BEEN COMPLETED AND THE FOURTH ONE WHICH WAS TO COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT OF THE CURRENT DOCUMENT UPLOAD SOLUTION. FOR ALL TYPES OF DOCUMENTS- WE ALREADY COMPLETED PHASE ONE WHICH ALLOWS FOR IDENTITY DOCUMENTS TO BE UPLOADED. AND WE'RE GONNA START WORK ON LOOKING AT OTHER DOCUMENTS SUCH AS WE AGE VERIFICATION DOCUMENTS MILITARY CLAIMS IN FEDERAL CLAIMS SO THAT'S UP NEXT. SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND AS I SAID WE ARE MEETING WEEKLY WITH- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SOUNDS AGENCY TO ENSURE THAT THESE ARE ALL BEING DONE SO WITH LAKE. IT'S MOVING TO THE NEXT PAGE- ET RESET IT VERIFICATION. OF THE SOLANO RICHARDSON- STATED OR THE NEW ID NEED BEGAN WE ACTUALLY BEGAN WORKING ON IN JULY THAT WE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED OCTOBER FIFTH PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STRIKE TEAM- AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED IT'S IS WORKING AS WE EXPECTED SO FAR AND- WE'RE JUST SO FAR IT'S WORKING AS DESIGNED. AND WE'RE THRILLED TO HAVE THIS NEW TOOL UP AND RUNNING TO ADDRESS AND STREAMLINE OUR IDENTITY PROCESS. STARTING OCTOBER ONE OVER HUNDRED THIRTY SIX INDIVIDUALS WERE CONTACTED TO COME BACK AND APPLY THROUGH IT NEED FOR A SOFT LAUNCH. FROM OCTOBER ONE THROUGH THAT OF OVER SIX SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND USERS SUCCESSFULLY VERIFIED THEIR IDENTITY THROUGH IT. SO AND THEN ALSO WE ARE ON SCHEDULE FOR PAYMENT WITHIN ONE WEEK OF THE SAN FIVE LAUNCH FOR ALL CLEAN CLAIMS SO WE REMAIN ON TRACK. FOR MOVING TO THE NEXT PAGE THE ATV RECEPT. WE ARE AND- SCHEDULED TO LIQUIDATE THE BACKLOG BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND DURING THESE THAT WE CONDUCTED- 240-003-0080 SEVEN OUTBOUND CALLS AS PART OF AN OVERALL COME COME PAIN. WE CONTACTED CLAIMANTS WHO HAD CERTIFIED OR SHARED NEED WAGE INFORMATION WITH US SO- THAT WENT VERY WELL AND WE DID FIND IT AND MAKING ALL THE CALLS OF THE TOP THREE REASONS WHY PEOPLE DON'T CERTIFY- ONE MAJOR DON'T KNOW THEY NEED TO THEY WENT BACK TO WORK OR JUST DIDN'T NEED YOU I BENEFITS OR THREE THEY WERE UNABLE TO REACH ET SO THIS WAS VERY HELPFUL INFORMATION AS WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO LIQUIDATED EDT CALL BACK LIST ON SEPT WHAT SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINTH SO ALL THE- PEOPLE THAT WERE ON THE LIST FOR WAITING FOR CALLS AND WE HAVE. COMPLETED THAT. WE DID REDUCE OUR BACKLOG- BY BERSERK- AND HAD WE NOT RESET AND DONE OF THE- RECEPT WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR WORKLOAD WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY SIX PERCENT. SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME AND- IN FACT WE'RE GOING A LITTLE A LITTLE BIT AHEAD SO WERE EXCITED WITH THAT. THE DEVELOPMENTS AND- THIS RECOMMENDATION HAS IS PROVING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL FOR ALL OF US. THE NEXT ONE STRIKING RECOMMENDED DATE THIS MAN. AFTERWARDS US SECRETARY RICHEST MENTIONED THIS AND ON THE TOOLS PROVIDED BY THE STRIKE TEAM EATING THE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DEFINE AND IDENTIFY THE BACKLOG INTO TWO DISTINCT CATEGORIES. THE FIRST ONE IS INITIAL CLAIMS AND IT'S AN INCLUSIVE LOOK AT ALL CLAIMS SUBMITTED MORE THAN TWENTY ONE DAYS AGO THAT NEED TO BE PROCESSED BY AT THE STAFF REGARDLESS. OF IF THE CLAIMANT CORTINI DEEP NEED TO TAKE SOME TYPE OF ACTION TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY. AND THEN TH SECOND ONE THEY CONTINUED PLAYING BACKLOG. THIS REPRESENTS CLAIMANTS WHO RECEIVED THE FIRST PAYMENT OR PAYMENTS. BUT DUE TO SUBSEQUENT ELIGIBILITY CERTIFICATION ISSUES SUCH AS REPORTED EARNINGS HAVE STOPPED RECEIVING PAYMENTS. THE NEW DASHBOARDS CAN BE LOCATED VIA EDIE'S NEWSROOM ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE WHERE THERE ARE DISPLAYED AND UPDATED EVERY THURSDAY- SO. HELLO EVERY WEEK AND WE ARE WE ARE DO ACTUALLY PRODUCE OF DAILY FOR OWN USE BUT WE'RE PUTTING OUT THERE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE SO IT'S A PROVIDES A COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY. MOVING ON TO FROM PREVENT MEASURES. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK AROUND THE PROBLEM- THAT ISSUER FRAUD WHICH IS THAT PLAGUED OF THE PAN UNEMPLOYED ASSISTANCE PROGRAM NATIONWIDE CALIFORNIA ISN'T AND ANY DIFFERENT THAT'S THE STATE'S BUT UP WORKING COLLABORATIVELY TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS IT. AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO FIGHT CRIME. SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN DOING FROM AT. STAND OBVIOUS THE EMPLOYMENT ARMY TO. IDENTITY DOCUMENTS ON THE FRONT END OF AN APPLICATION IT'S RIGHT THERE THAT'S A HUGE STEP FORWARD AND- WE'RE MOST EXCITED ABOUT THAT. OTHER AREAS LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERSHIPS- WE MONITOR AND ANALYSE ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD REPORTED TO THE EIGHTY INVESTIGATION DIVISION. WE ALSO WORK WITH CDCR TO OBTAIN CURRENT ROSTER TO PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED TO CROSSMATCH WITH CLAIMS. UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO STATEWIDE DATABASE FOR US TO DO THIS SO- WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO SORT OF. AS WE CAN AND GET INFORMATION. EDT IS WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA CYBERSECURITY INTEGRATION CENTER TO USE A DIGITAL FORENSICS TO IDENTIFY FRAUDULENT ACTORS AND FURTHER PREVENT THEIR CHILDREN OF THAT INTO OUR SYSTEM. AND THEN FINALLY- WE HAVEN'T PARTICIPATING IN A NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE WORKFORCE AGENCIES IDENTITY- HUB. AND UTILIZE OUR FORENSIC TOOLS AND IDENTIFY IDENTITY SCHEMES WELL LET ME HAVE DRINK OF WATER. AND THEN OFF. BROWN POLICY CHANGES WE ELIMINATED THE AUTOMATIC BACK I'M DATING A FEW EIGHT. AND THAT WASN'T A SEPT AND WE SAW DECREASE IN RPO A CLAIMS BY ABOUT 72% SINCE THEN. WE ALSO SUSPENDED US HIGH VOLUME CLAIMS FILED AT THE SAME ADDRESS. HELLO MY LETTER TO TALK ABOUT ME SURE CLAIMING ACCESS TO BEND. ONE THING RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT'S NOT THIS ONE THAT I WANT MENTION THIS IS A- NEW I DO PUT IN EVERY TO BANK OF. REQUESTING THAT THEY. WAIVE THE TEN DOLLAR FEE TO. DEBRA I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING I HEARD THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AND I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE COME UP IN THE STRIKE TEAM. I DID PUT TO THAT REQUEST. B. OF A HAS RESPONDED AND THEY HAVE AGREED TO WAIVE- THE TEN DOLLAR EXT- FEED TO EXPEDITE AND THEY WILL BE REFUNDING PEOPLE'S MONEY BACK TO APRIL FIRST. SO I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD NEWS. AND THEN ALSO. EDT AND BANK OF AMERICA- WE'VE BEEN WE NOTICED A VERY HIGH UNUSUALLY HIGH VOLUME OF CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SINGLE DRESSES AND- AS WELL AS SOME OTHER FRAUD INDICATORS AS A RESULT APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED NINETY THREE CLAIMS WERE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED- ADD AND BANK OF AMERICA ACCORDING ADDITIONAL REVIEW OF THREE HUNDRED ALMOST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND DEBIT CARDS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED PAYMENTS RECEIVED. IT IS ALSO REVIEWING THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PAYMENT AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO IDENTITY VERIFICATIO PROCESS. NOW ALL RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK ET- I AM LABOR AGENCY IS CURRENTLY MISS MEETING WITH THE BANK OF AMERICA TO WORK THROUGH MANY OF THESE CONCERNS AND ISSUES AND HOW AND THE BEST WAY TO MOVE FORWARD TO ENSURE WERE FIGHTING FRAUD AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING THAT MONEY IN THE HANDS OF OUR CLAIMANTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THAT IS OUR PRIORITY. WE ALSO EIGHTY CONTACTED ALL THE CUSTOMERS ASSOCIATE WITH THESE CLAIMS ASK FOR DOCUMENTS TO HELP. I ENTITY ET WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP WITH EMAILS TEXTS AND PHONE CALLS TO HELP REESTABLISH PAYMENT QUICKLY FOR A LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. EIGHTY RECEIVE DOCUMENTS FROM TWENTY NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND THE DEPARTMENT IS UTILIZING ALL MEANS AVAILABLE TO EXPLOIT EXPEDITE THE REVIEW AND WE HOPE TO HAVE RESOLUTION OVER THE NEXT FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS. FOR THE REMAINING CLIENTS THAT DID NOT PROVIDE US DOCUMENTS AT ALL THE EDT IS REACHING OUT AGAIN THROUGH EMAIL TAX AN OUTBOUND CALLS JUST TO MAKE SURE WE TOUCH EVERYBODY. AND IF THEY NEED TO FILE FOR BENEFITS THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY. MOVING FORWARD AT THE EIGHTY BELIEVES IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR IT ME VERIFICATION TECHNOLOGY WHICH LAUNCHED MONDAY. AT A FRIEND I'M PROCESS IT WILL REALLY MOVE TO HELP QUICKLY AUTHENTICATE LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. AND HELP THE EDT LIST- PROCESSING THEIR CLAIMS FASTER. IT WILL ALSO MITIGATE OF FRAUD ACTIVITY FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE SO. HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW MOVING FORWARD THIS WON'T BE A CONCERN- AT THIS POINT WE JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT UP CLAIMS THAT WE- STILL NEED TO PROCESS- ARE. PEOPLE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GETTING PAID. SO THAT. RIGHT TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT UP IS MISTER ELMO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE PRESS THE ACCEPT. CHAD ALLEN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- OUR OFFICE PRODUCED- I BRIEF HAND OUT FOR THE HEARING THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S WEBSITE. AND WE WERE ASKED BY STAFF TO PROVIDE OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND ALSO ANY RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAD AS TO HOW THE LEGISLATURE MY CONTINUE OVERSIGHT OVER- IMPROVEMENTS AT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. ARE BOTH SECRETARY RICHARDSON AND DIRECTOR HILLIARD PROVIDED A THOROUGH BACKGROUND SO I'LL BEGIN ON MY SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT HAVING TO DO WITH WITH OUR PERSPECTIVE OF THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT. IN RSS THAT THE REPORT IS CLEAR IT'S EXHAUSTIVE AND IT'S CRITICAL OF THE DELAYS AND BACKLOG AT EDIE'S SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN- THE REPORT'S FINDINGS ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR OFFICES UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT'S LED TO THE BACKLOG AND DELAY. IN THROUGHOUT THE REPORT WE'VE IDENTIFIES WITH THREE RECURRING THEMES THAT WE WANT TO SPEAK TO TODAY ONE THAT A LONG STANDING INSTITUTIONAL FOCUS ON FRAUD PREVENTION. DURING THE PANDEMIC PROVIDED LITTLE BENEFIT AND AT GREAT COST. TO THAT VETERANS STAFF HAVE BEEN HAMPERED BY A PERFECT STORM OF SORTS MADE UP FROM THE REQUIREMENT- FOR MANY STAFF TO DO WORK REMOTELY. THE SUDDEN SURGE AND YOU AYE CLAIMS TO SUCH AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL AND ALSO THE REQUIREMENT TO TRAIN NEW HIRES AT EDT. AND THIRD CONTRARY TO A COMMON NARRATIVE- THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT IDENTIFIES- THAT THE BACKLOG IS DUE IN MANY WAYS FIRST AND FOREMOST TO OPERATIONAL POLICIES OR CHALLENGES AS WELL AS POLICIES THE DEPARTMENT HAS MADE IN THE PAST RATHER THAN THE DEPARTMENT RELIANCE ON OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM GOING FORWARDTHE REPORTS AND THAT THE REPORT'S RECOMMENDATION SEEMS LOGICAL AND THE STATE'S TROOP TO TASK NOW IS TO ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS GOING FORWARD. I'M SHOULD THE FIRST PERSON HAVING TO DO WITH THE EDT IS LONGSTANDING INSTITUTIONAL FOCUS ON FRAUD PROVIDING LITTLE BENEFIT DURING THE PANDEMIC- AS A RESULT OF THIS FOCUS WHICH IS LARGELY IN RESPONSE TO FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT SET TARGETS FOR OVERPAYMENTS I'M AT IS SCRUTINIZED ROUGHLY 40% OF INCOMING YOU AYE APPLICATIONS FOR IDENTITY ERIFICATION SINCE A PANDEMIC BEGAN AND DURING LOW WORK LOAD TIMES THIS MANUAL REVIEW PROCESS IS DURABLE BY THE DEPARTMENT BUT DURING HIGH WORKLOAD TIMES LIKE WE SEEN THIS LAST YEAR- THAT THE CLAIMS TO GO TO THE MANUAL REVIEW PROCESS ULTIMATELY ARRIVING A BOTTLE. THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. AND I OF TO THE STRIKE TEAM THAT THE MANUAL REVIEW PROCESS IN FACT DID NOT CAPTURE A MEANINGFUL NUMBER OF FRAUDULENT CLAIMS AS IT AN INTENDED I IN FACT THAT THE STRIKE TEAM FOUND THAT THAT OF EACH FIVE HUNDRED CLAIMS THAT EDT STAFF FOR MANUAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION OUT ONE pFRAUDULENT CLAIM WAS CAPTURED. THE SECOND THEME THAT WE WANTED TO FOCUS ON IS AGAIN ABOUT THIS PERFECT STORM AND THAT IS THAT THE MOST EXPERIENCED STAFF AT EDT HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN HAMPERED IN THEIR WORK VIA A REQUIREMENT TO WORK REMOTELY. BY THE SURGEON WHO CLAIMS AND BY TRAINING NEW HIRES ET HAS HIRED MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND NEW STAFF SINCE A PANDEMIC BEGAN AND EXPERIENCED STAFF OF BEEN ASKED TO HELP ON BOARD AND TRAIN THE STAFF FIRST I AM DOING SO I'VE BEEN DIVERTED FROM- ANSWERING PHONE CALLS AND- WORKING DOWN THE BACKLOG OF MANUAL CLAIMS THAT THAT BOTH THE SECRETARY AND DIRECTOR MENTIONED. IN ADDITION THEY'VE HAD TO WORK REMOTELY AND AS WE ALL KNOW THIS CAN HAVE PRODUCTIVITY AFFECTS. ON ONE AS ONE EXAMPLE IN THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT ONE COMMON PROCESS STEP CALLED THREE COMPUTATIONS. ARE DISTRACTING BROWN TOOK TWO TO FIVE TIMES LONGER NOW THAN IT DID BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AS A RESULT OF THIS PERFECT STORM. OUR OUR RECORD THEME THAT WE IDENTIFIED HAS TO DO. WITH THAT THE BECAUSE OF THE CAUSES OF THAT THE DELAYED PAYMENTS AND CURRENT BACKLOG AND WITHOUT QUESTION EDIE'S RELIANCE ON OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY HAS HINDERED THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE QUICK PROGRAM CHANGES AND IT'S pLED THE DEPARTMENT TO RELY ON WORKAROUNDS AND THAT TIME INTENSIVE MANUAL PROCESS. BUT AS IDENTIFIED IN THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT. THE LARGE BACKLOG AND BROAD FRUSTRATION FELT BY WORKERS CAN ALSO BE LINKS TO AN EFFICIENT OPERATIONAL POLICIES. AS WELL AS- OUR C. DETERMINATION MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT IN THE PAST- AND SPECIFICALLY THE APARTMENTS FOCUS ON FRAUD PREVENTION- SOME OF THE KEY POLICIES IDENTIFIED BY THE STRAIGHT TEAM REPORT THAT THAT LED TO SOME OF- THIS BACKLOG THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY TECHNOLOGICAL IN NATURE. BOB REVOLVE AROUND THE CALL CENTER STAFFING AND LIMITATIONS THE CALL CENTER THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE PLANT CLAIMS THAT COME IN AND RECONCILING MULTIPLE CLAIMS INTO A SINGLE CLAIM- THE LIMITATIONS FOR OUTBOUND COMMUNICATIONS HISTORICALLY FOR EDT STAFF. AS WELL AS DOCUMENT SCANNING AND OTHER INTERNAL PROCESS STEPS. I'M. FOR OUR OFFICE IS MADE FOR ONE BROAD RECOMMENDATION FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT INTO SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS SO. FIRST THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CARRYING OUT THESE VIRGIN AND LARGELY SORT OF ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS- THAT WERE PART OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT FALLS ON THE ADMINISTRATION AT THIS POINT- THESE TASKS ARE ARE TAKING PLACE NOW AS BOTH THE SECRETARY AND THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED AND THAT AND THAT TENDS TO LIMIT THE LEGISLATURE'S OVERSIGHT GIVEN THE URGENCY OF SOME OF THESE ITEMS- BUT THERE ARE ALSO BROADER RECOMMENDATIONS THROUGHOUT THE REPORT. AS WELL AS SOME SENSITIVE FINDINGS THAT WE BELIEVE WARRANT THE LEGISLATURE'S ATTENTION AT THIS TIME A COUPLE FINDINGS THAT WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH ACCESSIBILITY SO THE STRIKE TEAM. IDENTIFIED THAT THAT- THAT THE EDT WHY SYSTEM MAY NOT BE ACCESSIBLE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES- THAT IT WAS ALSO CHALLENGING FOR INDIVIDUALS TO COMMUNICATE OR CONTACT EDT IF ENGLISH WAS NOT THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE- AND ADDITIONALLY SOME MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE MORE LEGISLATIVE- ATTENTION THIS TIME INCLUDE THE MAJOR RECOMMENDATION TO RESTART THE BENEFITS SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION PROJECT THAT YOU NEEDS MAJOR I. T. UPGRADE AS WELL AS RECOMMENDATIONS OVER ALL OF THAT THE STE THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT. OF LOOK THROUGH EXISTING USER EXPERIENCE- FORMS- REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS- ELIGIBILITY CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND IMPROVE THOSE SUCH THAT WORKERS APPLYING FOR BENEFITS WOULD BE FACED WITH WITH FEWER YOUR CONFUSION OR LESS CONFUSION I SUSPECT HAN AND REGARDING OUR OUR SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS- THAT THE SECRETARY AND THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED BOTH OF THESE AND SO WHAT WE WOULD REITERATE- BECAUSE THEY STRIKE TEAM REPORT INCLUDES SO MANY RECOMMENDATIONS A HUNDRED ELEVEN AS A DIRECTOR MENTIONED- WE RECOMMEND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MAINTAIN A PROCESS OR PROJECT TRACKER- WITH EACH RECOMMENDATION JUST A TABLE. AND ALONGSIDE THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE STATUS OF WHERE THE DEPARTMENT. BERMAN EXPECTS TO IMPLEMENT THAT RECOMMENDATION. THAT THE REPORT IS THOROUGH AND LENGTHY AND HAVING A SHORT BRIEF DOCUMENT OF THIS KIND WOULD HELP STAFF AND MEMBERS FOLLOW ALONG AS ET DE- SETS ABOUT THESE IMPROVEMENTS AND BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY MAYBE PROBLEM AREAS WHERE THE LEGISLATORS INVOLVEMENT IS WARRANTED. AND FINALLY AS AS SECRETARY RICHARDS AND MENTIONED- HE- DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION ARE INTENDING TO MAINTAIN INVOLVEMENT WITH EDT AND HELP GUIDE- SOME OF THEIR TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS- BUT AS WE UNDERSTAND IT DABABNEH AGENCY ITSELF IS NO LONGER DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS. AND GIVEN OUR ASSESSMENT THAT MANY OF THE- MANY IF NOT MOST OF THE CAUSES OF THE BACKLOG AND DELAY WERE OPERATIONAL IN NATURE RATHER THAN TECHNOLOGICAL WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ON REQUEST THAT GOV OFFICE REMAIN CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH THE PROJECT AND PROVIDE OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE AT LEAST UNTIL EDT HAS ELIMINATED THE BACKLOG. THANK YOU ARE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. YOUR CONVENIENCE SURE THANK YOU MISTER ALMOST TALK ABOUT OPERATIONAL SHORTCOMINGS THAT'S NOTHING NEW TO EASY TO USE IF THE CAR FOR QUITE SOME TIME. TWO DIFFERENT CHANGES OF LEADERSHIP IS THAT CORRECT. I THINK I WOULD CHARACTERIZE IT AS AS SOME OF THE OPERATIONAL SHORTCOMINGS THAT. IMMEDIATE DEFENSE DON'T NECESSARILY APPEAR ASSHORTCOMINGS WHEN WORKLOAD IS LOW BECAUSE THEY'RE MANAGEABLE. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THESE SAME ISSUES AROSE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO- THAT WE'RE SEEING NOW DURING DURING THE PANDEMIC SO YES SIR. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE FOCUS ON FRAUD- ISN'TIT IS IT TRUE THAT A LOT OF THAT FOCUS IS MANDATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NOT SO MUCH CALIFORNIA POLICIES. THAT'S TRUE SIR- THAT DO YOU I PROGRAM IS A STATE FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP THE STATE RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDING AND WITH THAT FEDERAL FUNDING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SETS PERFORMANCE STANDARDS NOW THEY SET STANDARDS ON UP OVERPAYMENTS WHICH IS THAT THE FRAUD STANDARD WE'RE TALKING HERE BUT THEY ALSO SET STANDARDS ON BENEFIT TIMELINESS- IN THE OPINION OF THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT IN SOME OF THEIR FINDINGS THEY POINT OUT THAT THE STATE HAD. TENDED TO EMPHASIZE THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS ABOUT FRAUD. MORE SO THAN THEY'VE EMPHASIZED THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS ABOUT BENEFIT PAYMENT TIMELINESS AND- WITH THE POINT WE WOULD RAISE IS. AT THIS POINT DURING A PANDEMIC GIVEN THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT BALANCE- MAY HAVE BEEN. I CHALLENGE FOR EDT N. AND ADDRESSING ITS BACKLOG- GIVEN ITS HISTORICAL- FOCUS ON THAT FRAUD PREVENTION MEASURE BUT REGARDLESS THESE ARE BOTH FEDERAL MANDATES CORRECT. THEY ARE YES OKAY SO ITEMS SUCH AS WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA. IS DOING OF ITS OWN VOLITION IS MANDATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I THINK THAT'S A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION SIR- THE MANDATES THEMSELVES ARE PERFORMANCE TARGETS SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE ON HOW WE SHOULD GO ABOUT MEETING THOSE TARGETS. BUT DOESN'T NECESSARILY PRESCRIBE EXACTLY HOW WE WOULD DO SO- ONE INSTANCES THAT IT MAY WELL BE THE CASE THAT THE STATE COULD HAVE REACHED ITS- OVERPAYMENT FEDERAL TARGET. BY USING A DIFFERENT STRATEGY FOR VERIFYING CLAIMS- THE ID NEED TOOL IS CERTAINLY ONE EXAMPLE THAT THE STATE COULD HAVE INSTITUTED. SEVERAL YEARS AGO- TO READ SOME OF THE THAT MANUAL VERIFICATION PROCESS BACKLOG FROM ACCUMULATING. OKAY THANK YOU. MY NEXT QUESTION FOR THIS HILLIARD. I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT CLINK CLINK CLAIMS. IN THEIR EASY RESET I KNOW YOU'VE DONE SOME CASELOADS BUT- IT WENT DOWN FROM ONE POINT SIX MILLION TO ONE POINT THREE MILLION. SO NOT A NOT A BIG DENT IN THAT. I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS- WE'RE JUST STARTING IN OCTOBER. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU WON'T LOOK AT IT THE BACKLOG UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GONNA TAKE THAT LONG TO DO THAT. I GUESS I YOU'RE CORRECT- IT'S GOING TO THAT LONG BECAUSE THAT'S THE THAT THE WORK IS VERY COMPLEX AND COMPLICATED. AND WE HAVE X. NUMBER OF A PROFESSIONAL STAFF THAT ARE SKILLED IN AND TRAINED. IN THOSE AREAS EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE REDIRECTED FOLKS ADDS UP RECOMMENDED IN THAT STRIKE FORCE. I IN THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT TO ENSURE OUR MOST EXPERIENCED PEOPLE ARE ON THE MOST COMPLEX. TASS AND RT SIX VARIANTS PEOPLE ARE NOT USED- COMPLEX TASK UNTIL SUCH TIME WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN THEM. SO WE'RE UTILIZING ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES IN A VERY SYSTEMATIC WAY TO ENSURE THAT WORKING THE BACKLOG AT QUICKLY IN. AND FILLING IT DOWN AS FAST AS WE CAN AS WELL AS LOOKING AT MAINTAINING THAT INVENTORY THAT'S COMING IN. SO ON ONCE WE'VE CLEAR THE AT THE BACK WE DO BELIEVE WE'RE IN GOOD WILL BE IN GOOD SHAPE MOVING FORWARD TO ASSUMING. THERE'S ANOTHER PANDEMIC OR SOME SOME OTHER UNKNOWN THING COMES ALONG SO AS FAR AS A BACKLOG GOES WHAT IS THE OLDEST CASE YOU HAVE. IS IT BEEN LIKE SEVERAL MONTHS OUT THERE AND THEY MAY FACE IN THE FOR YOU KNOW IN THE NOVEMBER DECEMBER. WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME ON THESE CASES. YEAH IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT THE SITUATION AND WHERE THEIR- I GUESS STUCK IN THIS IN THE PROCESS BUT WE DO HAVE CLAIMS AS OLD AS OUT IN JUNE. SUBMERGING JULY AUGUST THE OLDER ONES. SO YOU'RE TALKING JUNE JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER IN THOSE PLANS ARE STILL PENDING OUT THERE AND THAT'S THAT'S FIVE MONTHS FIVE OR SIX MONTHS ALREADY. YES THAT'S VERY LENGTHY- RICK REGARDING YOUR THE YOUR INVESTIGATIONS WITH CC ARE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GETTING THE INMATES LIST THERE'S NOT ONE BUT WE SEE A LOT OF FOLKS IN COUNTY JAIL INMATES HERE SEVERAL COUNTY THAT HAVE. RACKED UP TEN OR TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS USING THE STATE ISSUED OR COUNTY ISSUED IPADS TO DO THESE CLAIMS. HOW MANY INVESTIGATORS HAVE AN EIGHTY D. WE HAVE TWENTY SEVEN INVESTIGATORS. FROM AN EIGHTY TWO FOR THESE PRODUCT THESE CRIMINAL FRAUD ACTIVITIES- THE CDC ARE IS IT IS VERY- MORE AFTER THE FACT BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T HAVE A LIST THAT WE CAN CROSS MATCH IT IN AT THE VERY GET GO. BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO IDENTIFY ANY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT'S GOING ON UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE PANDEMIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY. IT HAS IT'S LENIENT RULES THAT- IF PEOPLE HAVE THE UTILIZED THEIR OWN NAME AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND- YOU KNOW PRIVATELY IT STATE OR NOT AND YOU KNOW NOT A CURSE RATED. IT'S VERY HARD TO DETECT LET'S WE KNOW THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY INCARCERATED SOMETIME WE ONLY KNOW THAT IS IF CDCR IS ABLE TO GIVE US THE INFORMATION WE NEED. SO THERE'S NO WAY YOU WOULD KNOW IF SOMEONE'S DOING IN THE COUNTY JAIL BECAUSE MOST FOLKS ARE GOING BACK STATE PRISON THESE DAYS. I THINK IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THE COUNTY HERE SEVERAL COUNTY WHEN FOLKS WENT INTO CUSTODY A LOT OF A RECEIVING GENERAL ASSISTANCE THEY HAD THEY'RE ABLE TO TALK WITH. THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THAT ONCE THOSE FILES FROM THE CUSTODY THERE STOPPED THEY STOP GETTING GENERAL ASSISTANCE. AND THAT WAS DEEMED TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE WITH THAT- ARE. YOU GUYS WORKING ON A PLAN TO TALK TO THE COUNTIES I. AT THIS POINT BEEN WORKING WITH DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND CDCR. MORE ON THAT LEVEL- WORKS IN FOCUSING ON THAT. BUT CERTAINLY OUR HOPE IS TO WORK WITH THE COUNTY. SURE SO SINCE YOU HAVE TWENTY SEVEN INVESTIGATORS AT STATEWIDE IN A STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. I NOW OKAY MOST THIS FALLS ON THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES IT AND I'M GONNA POINT OUT MMHM I READ A HIGH TECH CRIMES TASK FORCES CENTRAL VALLEY THAT TARGETED THIS TYPE OF- ACTION FOR THREE YEARS. AND I JUST TO MY COLLEAGUES THERE'S BEEN NO INCREASE IN FUNDING SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SO NINE YEARS- IT HAS INCREASED AT ALL THIS IS BILLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO DELIVER THE BEST TO GET IT. AND THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT SO- IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT- SO REAL QUICK ON ON THE ID ME. THAT USING OF. FACIAL RECOGNITION. ANOTHER THEIR CROSS MATCHING WITH A DIFFERENT CREDIT REPORTS- TELEPHONE AT BILLS A DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLD FACILITY BILLS THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE- THE PICTURE OF THE ID'S IS. BUT ON THAT. NOTE SAID NO INTEREST YOU KNOW INTRICATE WORKINGS OF IT BUT- RIGHT BUT I ALSO. I ALSO DID PROVIDE YOU ALL THE HAND OUT I HOPE JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION ON IT ME THAT THEY PROVIDED ME TO TALK ABOUT THEIR WE GOT THAT MY I GUESS MY QUESTION ON THAT IS IF WITH ID ME THAT THERE'S HOLOGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ON OUR TO ISSUE ID'S. AND SOMEONE TAKING A PICTURE THAT YOU CAN'T LOOK AT THOSE HOLOGRAMS. AND THOSE LABELS TO TELL ON THAT SO I'M CURIOUS ABOUT HOW YOU VALIDATE THAT BECAUSE- IT'S VERY EASY. TO PRODUCE A FAKE ID. THIS IS A PICTURE AND- SO UNLESS YOU'RE USING THAT IT I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW PERSONALLY I DON'T KNOW BUT WE CERTAINLY COULD TALK TO ID MAN LET YOU KNOW THIS FAR AS DIEM VIGO'S OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE MOST PEOPLE STATE HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR ID. AT EMAIL HOW'S THAT WORKINGWITH DMV HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR FULL- I GUESS WHAT I THINK WE'VE BEEN USING- MATT ACROSS MATCH WITH DMV AND THE SO SECURITY FOR MANY YEARS NOW THAT HAS BEEN SORT OF OUR ARMED I MAIN METHOD OF IDENTITY PROOFING. BUT NOT NOT PHOTOGRAPHS UP TILL NOW IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE AN ID. YEAH. SO I GUESSI'M LIKE WITH MY QUESTION FOR YOU DOES IF YOU DO NEED MORE ACCESS TO DMV TO THE DMV PHOTOS. WOULD THAT MAKE THE JOB EASIER. WELL I BELIEVE IT ME AS I MEAN IT THERE THAT COMPANY IS WHAT WHO ARE CONTRACTING WITH IN ORDER TO DO THAT DON'T APPROVING SO I THINK. THAT IS ADDRESSING ARE ARE THE MAIN CONCERN OF WHO YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING BUSINESS WITH THE PERSON. THAT'S BUT ALL THE INFORMATION THEY GET IS ISRAEL TABLE THE DARK WEB WE'RE MOSTLY FLEXIBLE A DARK LIVING IN GETTING SOMEONE'S NAME SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER ADDRESS I MEAN THEY HAVE YOUR WHOLE PROFILE. SO SOMEONE WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION IF ASKED IN INCLUDES DON THAT THAT'S REALLY AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW SO. I'M I'M TRYING TO RECONCILE THAT FACT. AND THEN WITH THE I. D. AND THEN TAKING THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THEMSELVES. RIGHT AT SECRETARY RICHARD SAID I DON'T KNOW IF ANY TIMES AVAILABLE TO TALK ABOUT- ID ME AS SORT OF. HE'S BEEN. PLAYED AN INSTRUMENTAL ROLE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION AND- PROBABLY SPEAK TO IT MUCH BUT THAN ME. YES HI. HELLO CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS AMY TONG AND STATE AT ITS MISSION OFFICER AND- I CANPICK UP PERHAPS ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED- BY MEMBER COOPER- SPECIFICALLY- ALTHOUGH REVERSE ORDER A MEMBER COOPER SPECIFICALLY TO THE INFORMATION THAT IS. A COMPARISON WITH THE DMB BECAUSE DMB IN THEIR REAL ID PROCESS ARE USING SAME TECHNOLOGY ID ME UP THROUGH A DOCUMENT VERIFICATION PROCESS SO THE INTENT IS THAT AFTER THIS INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF ID ME SPECIFICALLY WITH EDT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT WHETHER THERE ARE SUFFICIENT FURTHER EFFICIENCY THAT CAN BE GAINED BY EDT AND EMB WORKING TOGETHER TO- PROCESS- SOME IDENTITY VERIFICATION FASTER A ONE THING I DO LIKE TO NOTE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT HAVE ALREADY SIGNED UP. WITH AN IDEA ME ACCOUNT THROUGH THE DMB PROCESS THEY DO NOT NEED TO RECREATE THOSE ACCOUNTS AND KEY BE AUTOMATICALLY LOG IN USING THAT SAME ACCOUNT OVER IT EDT WHETHER THEREFORE IN THE EARLY RESULTS WE HAVE SEEN SINCE ITS IMPLEMENTATION THERE'S ACTUALLY OVER 25% OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE APPLYING TO EDT RIGHT NOW ARE USING THE EXISTING. IT ME ACCOUNT. AND YEAH AND- MEMBER COMMITTED TO YOUR QUESTION A WHETHER IDEA CONSTRUED A FACIAL RIGHT WHEN USING FACIAL RECOGNITION- I'M AT AND AGAIN YOU KNOW THIS WILL BE A QUESTION. OF BETTER ADDRESS BITING ME DIRECTLY BUT FROM THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE APPLIED IN THIS THIS IS NOT A FACIAL RECOGNITION TYPE OF VERIFICATION IT'S ACTUALLY USING- INFORMATION SUCH AS THE INDIVIDUALS. A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND- I'VE ACTUALLY PERSON HAD GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS AS IT ONE OF THE BETA TESTER. AND THERE'S QUESTION ASKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE FINANCIAL DATA AND USE DOES AS BACKGROUND INFORMATION TO VERIFY. AND OTHERS OTHER REGISTRATION INFORMATION OF USE USING A PHONE ARE YOU IS THE PHONE REGISTERED TO YOU EXEDRA EXIDE RUSSELL THERE'S MULTIPLE ALGORITHM DOLLARS USED. BEFORE THAT OUR FACIAL RECOGNITION EVEN BEING APPLIED TO ALL THOSE LINES. ARE VISIBLE IN THE DARK LEAD TO. EVERY ITEM MENTIONED BILL ON THE DOOR WEB BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION CAN. THROUGH DATA BREACHES OVER THE YEARS. PRICE I WANT TO SEPARATE IT OUT SO- I'M ALSO A VERY MUCH AS ONE OF THE ACCOLADE OF THE- CALIFORNIA CYBER SECURITY INTEGRATION CENTERSTHAT ARE ENGAGED- WITH EDT ON A SEPARATE EFFORT TO LOOKING INTO FRAUD ASPECT. I WANTED TO SEPARATE OUT THE INFORMATION ON THE DARK WEB S. MIGHT HAVE BRED IS IDENTITY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN STOLEN OR IDENTITY THAT IS ACCOUNTS ARE CREATED WITH EDT A FURTHER TO BE SOLD ON THE DARK WEB- FOR THOSE IDENTITY THAT BE STOLEN- THEY WOULD HAVE A- A DIFFICULTY GOING THROUGH THE ID NEED VERIFICATION PROCESS. BECAUSE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THE WHOSE NEEDS TO VERIFIED YOU WOULD NEED TO KNOW MORE THAN ONE TO COMPONENT OF THAT ENTITY IN OTHER WORDS NOT JUST YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER. IS YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE PLUS SOMETHING SIMILAR TO LIKE WHAT IS YOUR MORTGAGE COMPANY AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT ARE NOT SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY CAN BE. BOUGHT THROUGH FROM A- DRIVER'S LICENSE INFORMATION PERSPECTIVE SO THERE'S THAT MULTI FACTOR VERIFICATION PROCESS. INVOLVED THANK YOU MISTER SHE- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN LET ME JUST START BY- IT WITH THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THIS REPORT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL DOCUMENT- I REALLY WANNAGIVE KUDOS TO- OUR CABINET SECRETARY GOVE OPS AS WELL AS MISS PARKER- THE STRIKE TEAM DESERVES. A LOT OF CREDIT FOR TAKING ON THIS VERY DIFFICULT TASK OF ANALYZING HOW TO TURN AROUND THE AGENCY THAT IS BROKEN FOR BEEN BROKEN FOR YEARS. ALSO JUST TAKE A MOMENT IN FACT THAT MANY MEMBERS OF RANK AND FILE EDT FOR ALL THEIR WORK DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. WHAT I WILL SAY ABOUT THIS REPORT IS IT SAYS. WHAT MANY OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR MONTHS IN A BIPARTISAN WAY THIS REPORT. DOCUMENTS IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL HOW EDT HAS FAILED CALIFORNIA IN EVERY IMAGINABLE WAY HOW BROKEN THIS AGENCY HAS BEEN. IN THE HUNDRED NINE PAGES OF THIS REPORT WITH OVER A HUNDRED RECOMMENDATIONS. IT PROVIDES A ROADMAP AND MY HOPE IS WE ARE AT THE LOWEST POINT OF THIS AGENCY AT A TIME WHEN OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE GONE INTO EXTREME DEBT DEPLETED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS AND ARE HAVING TROUBLE PAYING FOR RENT AND PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. I THE NUMBER OF. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS LET ME JUST START FIRST WITH THE ODOMETER ON THE BACKLOG. TO DIRECTOR. AS WE DISCUSSED IN PRIOR HEARINGS. WE WERE NEVER ABLE TO GET. AN UP FRONT ANSWER FROM YOU ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE BACKLOG. AT A MEETING WITH MANY LEGISLATORS. YOU ANSWERED A QUESTION BY OUR BUDGET YEAR MR TANG. ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE BACKLOG IN JULY WHERE YOU SAID THE BACKLOG WAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND. NEW A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND A HUNDRED THOUSAND. THEN TOWARD THE- TOWARD OF A FEW WEEKS LATER THE ADMINISTRATION TOLD US THE BACKLOG WAS ONE POINT ONE MILLION. TO BE CLEAR BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER. AND THEN WHEN THIS REPORT CAME OUT. LATE ON A SATURDAY NIGHT WE LEARNED THAT THE BACKLOG WAS ONE POINT SIX MILLION CLAIMS. TO BE CLEARED BY THE END OF JANUARY. SO MY QUESTION IS GIVEN THIS HISTORY. OF CHALLENGES OF UNDERSTANDING THE SIZE OF THE BACKLOG AND WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE CLEARED. I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WE MAY LACK SOME CONFIDENCE AND UNDERSTANDING AND BELIEVING THAT THIS IS A SIZE OF THE BACKLOG AND WHEN IT'S GOING TO GET CLEARED AND I WANTED TO ASK. ARE YOU FULLY CONFIDENT THAT THIS IS THE SIZE OF THE BACKLOG AND THAT IT'S GONNA BE CLEARED BY THE END OF JANUARY. WHICH BY THE WAY IS A DATE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY MANY MONTHS FROM NOW AND A VERY CHALLENGING DAY FOR CONSTITUENTS. YES I UNDERSTAND THAT I YES I AM VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE- TO THE WAY THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BACKLOG NOW SHOWS A VERY. OF TOTAL POPULATIONS UP THE WAY WE WERE LOOKING AT IT BACK IN THIS SPRING IN THE SUMMER. OF WAS REALLY BASED ON- WORKLOAD OF WHEN PEOPLE TURNED IN- ITEMS- NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE STRIKE TEAM. A MORE HOLISTIC- NOT ONLY UP WE'RE LOOKING AT INVENTORY WORK THAT. WE HAVE. ON OUR PLATE THAT WE NEED TO GET DONE BUT ALSO WE'RE LOOKING AT. CLAIMS WERE- OUR OUR CLAIMANTS HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO US BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S PROBABLY SITUATIONS WHERE THEY TRIED TO GET WORK THROUGH US OR GET A HOLD OF US AND COULDN'T AND MAYBE STILL ARE OUT THERE. SO WE'RE INCLUDING ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE NOW AS PART OF THE BACKLOG IT'S MUCH MORE INCLUSIVE THAT'S WHY IT GREW SO MUCH- SO MUCH LARGER. BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE ARE COUNTING FOR EACH AND EVERY PERSON THAT COULD POSSIBLY. OF BE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS AND- AND WORK THROUGH IT SO. WE ARE FEELING VERY GOOD ABOUT- LAST TWO WEEKS AND ARE BURNED DOWN WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WE'RE ON TRACK- IT NEEDS LOOKING GOOD SO AT THIS POINT BARRING ANY OTHER. NEW FEDERAL LEGISLATION OR OR OR OR WHAT NOT. WE FEEL VERY CONFIDENT AND VERY GOOD THAT WILL. CLEAR ON MY THIS THE COMING MONTH BECAUSE TO BE HONEST IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO TELL OUR CONSTITUENTS. THAT WE HAVE A GET RESOLVED IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS GIVEN. THE TRACK RECORD NAPS- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT THAT YOU'VE EXPRESSED SOME. SOME PRIDE IN IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT MAY. I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS JUST ON THE PRESS RELEASE THAT WE WERE PROVIDED IN THE LAST TWELVE HOURS. YOU SAID MORE THAN STE ABOUT SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. OF INDIVIDUALS WERE ABLE TO VERIFY THEIR ID ONLINE TO READY MADE. PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION YOU TOLD THE PUBLIC THAT ABOUT 60% OF APPLICANTS WERE ABLE TO AUTOMATICALLY VERIFY OR PUT ANOTHER WAY. 40% WERE FLAGGED FOR MANUAL REVIEW AND THAT'S WHAT TOOK SO MUCH TIME. SO FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GONE FROM 60% AUTOMATIC VERIFICATION. 66% AUTOMATIC VERIFICATION WHEN YOU TOLD US WEEKS AGO THAT ID ME WOULD AUTOMATICALLY VERIFIED OVER NINETY ONE. PERCENT OF ADVOCATES. SO HAS THIS TO MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT FROM THE VERY NUMBER PROVIDED US. YEAH ABSOLUTELY IS PERFORMING AS EXPECTED AS FAR AS THE UP THE COMPLETE 9091% THAT WE'RE GOING FOR IS STILL TOO EARLY TO TAKE A LOOK AT. THOSE NUMBERS- WE JUST HAVE SARTED GETTING CLAIMS IN AND THEY HAVEN'T RUN THROUGH ALL OF OUR AUTOMATED PROCESSES EVEN OUTSIDE OF. IT ME SO THE WE DON'T WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY GOOD METRICS YET AS FAR AS AS WHAT'S BEING DONE THROUGH AUTOMATICALLY. WE DO HAVE METRICS AS FAR AS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE. GETTING THROUGH IT ME AND- WERE THERE BEING VALIDATED AND THEY'RE BEING CLEARED. IF I COULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW WE WERE EXPECTING AN AUTOMATIC VERIFICATION OF IS AUTOMATIC VERIFICATION OF SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. THAT'S A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE THAT AS A COMMENT- AGAIN I'M NOT JUST WHICH- IS ACTUALLY MOVING THINGS FASTER BUT I HOPE TO BE. UP ENOUGH HOPE THAT WE'LL GET MORE INFORMATION. MORE TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT THE DASHBOARD AND JUST MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT IT. THIS LEGISLATURE LED BY OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DALY. MOVE FORWARD WITH BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE- AND ALSO WITH OUR CHAIRMAN. AB ONE OH SEVEN SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A SENSE OF. A TRACKING. AND I HAVE TO SAY. I'D GIVE ET D. MAYBE A D. WHEN IT COMES TO HOW YOU HAVE SHOWN YOUR INFORMATION SO YOU YOU YOU YOU PROVIDE A DASHBOARD. THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE PUBLIC TO FIND. IT SHOULD BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE ON YOUR WEBSITE BUT INSTEAD IT'S LINKED IN A PRESS RELEASE. IT'S IN A PDF FORM. SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPARE WEEK TO WEEK INFORMATION THEIR SEPARATE PDF FORMS. FOR DALY INITIAL VERSUS DALY CONTINUED BACKLOGS. IT'S CONFUSING IT'S HARD TO NAVIGATE IT'S NOT TRANSPARENT IT'S NOT ACCOUNTABLE. THIS IS NOT THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE ASK YOU TO DO. COULD YOU GIVE SOME COMMENTS ON THE DASHBOARD. AND HOW YOU ENDED UP. PROVIDE INTO US THIS WAY. IN AB ONE SEVEN IT WAS VERY WHAT WE WERE WHAT DATA L. WE REFER TO. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID- I CERTAINLY WILL GO BACK AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK AND ALL TALK MY COMMUNICATIONS PEOPLE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE COULD DO TO MAKE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY BUT WE WERE RESPONDING TO EXACTLY WHAT THE LEVEL OF WHAT THE LEGISLATION AND SAD. NOW WITH OUR NEW DASHBOARDS OUR HOPE IS TO REACH OUT TO THE COMMITTEE AND- SORT OF THAT REPLACE IT WITH THE NEW DASHBOARD METRICS AS AS RECOMMENDED BY THE STRIKE TEAM. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT- WHEN WE CAN HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT IT BUT I DON'T THINK THIS THE DASHBOARD YOU PROVIDED MEETS WITH THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE WERE ASKING YOU TO DO BUT THAT'S A CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER DAY. FROM WHAT I ASK YOU A QUESTION RENT ACCESS AND WHO GETS TO ACCESS YOUR SYSTEM ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH AT THEIR HOME YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS. NO I DON'T NOT SIX ABOUT IT'S ABOUT 40% OF OUR STATE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE STRIKE. TEAM REPORT LAID OUT IS THAT INDIVIDUALS pFACE INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING UNITY WE HAVE HEARD FROM- NOT JUST OUR CONSTITUENTS BUT CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS. WHO HAVE BEEN. WHO CAN REACH OUT TO YOU ON THIS UP WE I HAVE BROUGHT THIS UP TO YOUR ATTENTION. IN FACT IN REPORT I WAS- I WAS PLEASED. YOU ACTUALLY COPIED LANGUAGE THAT I HAD PROVIDED TO YOUR OFFICE- WEEKS AGO- AND I APPRECIATE THE PLAGIARISM BECAUSE IN THIS CASE.IT REFLECTS THE FACT THAT YOUR AGENCY IS AT RISK OF VIOLATING. OUR STATE LANGUAGE ACCESS LAW. AND FROM WHAT I CAN TELL THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY. PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM ENGLISH IS NOT THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE. I'D LIKE TO ASK WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT AREA I'M HOPING THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS BUT ACCORDING TO THE STRIKING REPORT. AND ACCORDING TO THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THERE HAS BEEN ON. WE GET LANGUAGE ACCESS IS A VITAL AREA THERE WERE ALWAYS WORKING TOWARDS- WE DO HAVE AN NUMBER DIFFERENT AVENUES FOR PEOPLE TO WORK THROUGH. WE HAVE A VERY STIFF MULTIPLE LANGUAGES ON OUR OUR- PHONE LINE. WE ALSO HAVE A SERVICE OF PEOPLE CALL IT'S NOT A LANGUAGE WE IMMEDIATELY HAVE WE CAN- YOU KNOW. BRING PEOPLE IN TO HELP WITH THE TRANSLATION. WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON FORM CHANGES AND UPDATES ON. OUR APPLICATION IS IN SPANISH AND ENGLISH I KNOW THAT'S YOU KNOW THEY'RE STILL MANY OTHERS IN OTHER LANGUAGES. BUT THAT WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT EVERY DAY. IT'S JUST NOT A QUICK FIX IT JUST IT TAKES TIME AND RESOURCES. BUT I TELL I TOTALLY CONCUR WE NEED TO DO MORE IN THAT ARENA. I WILL SAY BIG WITH PANDEMIC IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO- ENGLISCHER OR NON ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE. EVERYBODY HAS HAD A- STRUGGLE WITH IT AS WE ALL KNOW JUST BECAUSE OF THE SHEER MASSES IN THIS YEAR VOLUMES. SO YEAH THAT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION I TOTALLY AGREE. SO IF I COULD JUST RESPOND TO THAT YOU'VE GIVEN THAT SAME ANSWER FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS WE'VE ASKED YOU THIS QUESTION IN MANY MANY WAYS WERE TOLD YOU GUYS ARE WORKING ON IT- WE TOLD WE'RE TOLD THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE IMPROVEMENTS ON THE PHONE LINES AND EMAILS ON THE FORMS. NONE OF US HAVE SEEN IT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA- AND I'M AT A POINT WHERE WHEN A CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION BRINGS THIS TO MY ATTENTION- I THINK WE ARE ON ON. ON VERY DANGEROUS GROUND YOU'RE VIOLATING THE CIVIL RIGHTS. OF OUR CONSTITUENTS LET ME JUST. ADD A COUPLE MORE POINTS FROM CHALLENGES TO AXIS OF THE REPORT. ALSO LAYS OUT THAT CALIFORNIA'S WITH DISABILITIES ARE INCREDIBLY CHALLENGE IN ACCESSING THIS AND I THINK THAT NUMBERS. BETWEEN REPORT ALSO LAYS OUT THAT IF YOU'RE A LONGTIME PERSON THAT DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO. A COMPUTER- YOU'RE REMARKABLY CHANNELS IF YOU ADD ALL THIS UP. BETWEEN NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS. CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES CALIFORNIANS WELCOME. THAT'S AT LEAST OVER HALF OF OUR- WHO REPRESENTS SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE CHALLENGERS I WANNA MAKE THAT POINT. ON MODERNIZATION I KNOW THIS REPORT CALLED FOR A HALT. OF THE MODERNIZATION EFFORTS THAT HAD BEEN. AN ELEVEN YEAR PROJECT THREE YEARS IN THE MAKING. AND I THINK IT MADE SENSE TO HOLD THAT REPORT BUT I AM CONCERNED OF WHAT THE LONG TERM PLAN AS I LIKE TO ASK. MR FONG ON THE CALL. WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN ONCE WE CLEAR THE BACKLOG OF THE NEXT STEPS OF MODERNIZATION. HOW CAN WE- USE THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST OF OUR STATE WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATORS TO. REALLY. PUT THIS I. T. CHALLENGE BEHIND US. THANK YOU- STATE MEMBERSHIP WITHOUT QUESTION HAPPY TO JUMP IN HERE- SPECIFICALLY TO THE- PSM PROJECT I MEAN REFERENCE HERE- WE- ARE ASKED AND READY. TO WORK WITH- EDT AS SOON AS THE BACKLOG IT'S CLEAR- THERE ARE SEVERAL ITEMS WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON ONE IS TO WORKING WITH THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION- WORKING WITH FROM MY PROCESS RE ENGINEERING ASPECT. LOOKING AT THE CURRENT OPERATION IN POLICY AND PROCEDURE ASPECTS OF THE EIGHTY TO TAKE A LOOK WHAT IMPROVEMENT THAT CAN BE MADE. SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY APPLYING TECHNOLOGY TO THE EXISTING PROCESS BUT USING TECHNOLOGY AS A WAY AND AS ENABLE OUR TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. AND I BELIEVE- L. A. O. WAS ALSO REFERENCING THIS THAT IT'S REALLY BAD POLICY TECH OF COMBINATION. IS WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT MODERNIZATION. SECOND TO THAT THERE ARE THREE- MODULES IF YOU WOULD OUR FOCUS FOR THE BSN. THAT IS- DISABILITY INSURANCE AS WELL AS PAID FAMILY LEAVE THAT'S ON TOP OF- UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. AND WHEN THE RE ASSESSMENT BEGINS NEEDS TO LOOK AT HOW ARE THE PRIORITIZES JOKES WITH APPLY. AND THEN SPECIFICALLY APPLY TO THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS ON WHAT YOU DID THE SAME PROVIDE. AND THIRD ITEM MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT FROM A USER- INPUT ASPECT. NOW THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAVE A GREAT CREATED YOU KNOW IT'S A TREMENDOUS OF- EXPERIENCE THAT. THIS WOULD GAIN Y EDT IN TERM OF WHAT THE BEST WAY TO SERVE- THOSE- CLAIMANTS OR INDIVIDUALS NEED SERVICE FROM EDT. TAKING DOES IMPORT ESTHER DRIVING THE FOCUS AND THE PRIORITY AND HOW TO BE. A STREAMLINED TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE THOSE IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND WITH ALL OF THAT- AS YOU MENTIONED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHEWED OUT WE HAVE GREAT ASK IN THIS OF. AND WE DO NEED TO SOLD. INPUT AS WELL AS INNOVATIVE IDEAS FROM MANY OF THE FIRMS IN VARIOUS IN SIZE AND THAT SHOULD BE BY DESIGN SO WE CAN HEAR- MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IN RESOLVING THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU KNOW THAT'S GONNA BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION INTO THE COMING YEARS- I KNOW I'M GONNA DEFERRED QUESTIONS AROUND FRAUD TO THE NEXT PANEL ALTHOUGH I'M ASSUMING AT EDT WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AFTER THAT. ONE FINAL COMMENT AND SAID THE QUESTIONS AND THAT IS ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS REPORT SO THE STRIKE TEAMS FINISH ITS WORK AND I THINK THE TOP CONCERN MANY OF US HAVE IS THESE ARE GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS. HOW DO WE ENSURE THEY'RE ALL GONNA GET DONE WE LEARNED TODAY THAT FIFTY THREE OF THE HUNDRED ELEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS AREN'T EVEN IN PROGRESS. AND WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED AN ACCOUNTING OF WHAT THE SIX SIX AND SO. MY QUESTION TO THE DIRECTOR IS I'M ASSUMING YOU SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE ELIO ABOUT A PROGRESS TRACKER SO THAT WE CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE- LIKE TO ALSO ASK THE STREET TEAM WHAT IS GOING TO BE YOUR INVOLVEMENT FOR ENSURING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE DONE LET ME JUST. NOTE FROM DISTRICT TEAM REPORT. THAT THERE WERE MANY INSTANCES IT WAS IT WAS FASCINATING READING BECAUSE WE LEARN FOR EXAMPLE. THAT EVEN THOUGH THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDED. THAT EDT TURN OFF CERTAIN THINGS THAT WERE FLOODING PLANES FOR MANUAL PROCESSING. EDT RESISTED THAT AND DISTRICT TEAM CONCLUDED THAT EDT COULD'VE AVOIDED SENDING HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS TO MANUAL PROCESSING IF IT. AND LISTEN TO THIS TRACK TEAM REPORT. DISTRICT ALSO. WROTE THAT A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES WERE SO SIMPLE TO FIX THAT THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR WHY THEY WEREN'T DRESSED PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF THIS REPORT. SO MANY OF US READ THIS. ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE WE PROVIDED MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS REPORT TO EDT FOR MONTHS AND WE WERE NOT. WE WERE NOT LISTEN TO. SO THE CONCERN IS NOT THAT THE STRIKE TEAM IS DON WHO'S ACTUALLY GOT A WHOLE EDT ACCOUNTABLE. FOR GETTING THIS DONE SO. SO TO DIRECTOR HILLIARD. LOVE TO KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA BE. AGREEING WITH THE L. A. RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND PROGRESS TRACKING AND TO THE STRIKE TEAM ONE UNDERSTAND YOUR ROLE MOVING FORWARD YES ABSOLUTELY WE ARE WE'VE ACTUALLY ALREADY UPLOADED OUT WE HAVE A TRACKER GOING. SO WE'RE JUST FINISHING UP- IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS TO FINISH UP UP THE DATES THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO. OF FOR EACH AND EVERYONE OF THAT RECOMMENDATION SO ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. WHEN CAN WE RECEIVE THAT. I WOULD SAY BY THAT WOULD BY THE END OF THE MONTH GREAT. AND THEN TO MADAM SECRETARY- AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR LEADERSHIP IF IT WERE UP TO ME- YOU GUYS WOULD KEEP WORKING WITH EDT VERY CLOSELY FOR THE NEXT SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS. I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF BALLS ON YOUR PLATE BUT JUST CURIOUS WHAT WILL THE INVOLVEMENT OF DISTRICTING BE MOVING FORWARD. MEMBERSHIP IF I COULD- STEPPED IN FOR. A SIGNATURE RICHARDSON AND IN FACT AFTER THIS I'D LIKE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IF YOU WOULD ALLOW TO OFFER ME TO PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION BACK ON THE ID ME A STEP TO STICK TOGETHER. SO THIS IS A QUICKLY ON THE STRIKE TEAM CONTINUE ROLE- WE DOES THIS IS A CONSTANT CONVERSATION AND WE'RE BEING VERY. OPEN WITH EDT ABOUT CONTINUE INVOLVEMENT SPECIFICALLY FROM DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND OFFICE OF A DIGITAL INNOVATION. AND UP IN CITY TEASE ROLE IN THE OVERSIGHT WILL BE MONITORING OF A LOT MORE CLOSER. WITH IMPLEMENTATION ON THESE- STATS START ADDRESS AT. INVITING OF A RECOMMENDATION. AND WITH THE DATA DRIVEN APPROACH IF THINGS ARE AND IF WE'RE NOT SEEING IMPROVEMENT. IN THE EXPECTED TIME FRAME. AND THERE'S GOOD DATA AS WELL AS EVIDENCE OF BACKING BUT THE RESULTS WHY. THAT WOULD BE THE MEASURE THAT NEEDS TO BE VERY MUCH- IMPLEMENTED TO CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE IS CAUSING THAT. OR IS THERE ARE SOME I'M DISCOVERY ISSUE THAT PERHAPS THAT'S CREEPED UP. AND I THINK THAT LEVEL OF A VERY MUCH IN BED IT INTERACTION. AS WELL AS CONSTANT COMMUNICATION AND WITH THE SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- WILL BE ABLE TO STAY QUITE ENGAGE IN TERM OF THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF ET. HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND APPRECIATE YOUR INVOLVEMENT I KNOW OF THE APARTMENT HAS BEEN DEEPLY ENGAGE AND I THINK IT'S BEEN. A VERY MUCH A PART OF THE POSITIVE. MOVEMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS REPORT. THANK YOU MISTER TERRIFIC THANK YOU MISTER CELLOPHANE. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER- COOPER THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME OF- THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE OBVIOUSLY LOOKING AT EDT- SO REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING LEADERSHIP AND- I KNOW A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE CHAIRS OF OTHER COMMITTEES THAT. WERE THIS IS A VERY PERTINENT INFORMATION I HAVE TWO QUICK QUESTIONS AND I DID HEAR IT AND MISS HILLIARD'S. PRESENTATION BUT YOU KNOW ONE I DO APPRECIATE THAT HE DID HE'S WORKING ON THE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS. EVEN THOUGH AS MR TO POINT. IT OUT FIFTY THREE OF THOSE TO HAVE NO PROGRESS ON THOSE. BUT JUST WANTED ASK BECAUSE YOU DON'T MIND OF THE WOODS. I'M GETTING A LOT COMPLAIN LIKE I KNOW A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE ABOUT THE CALL CENTERS. AND WHEN I READ THE STRIKE TEAMS REPORT. YOU KNOW AND WHEN I READ WHAT STRUCK OUT TO ME WAS THAT. WHEN INDIVIDUALS WERE CALIFORNIANS CALL THE D. D. FOR ASSISTANCE AND HELP. NINETY EIGHT POINT 6% OF THEM. WERE TOLD TO CALL BACK BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T RESOLVE THAT ISSUE ON THAT FIRST CALL. AND SO MISS HOLDER IF YOU JUST HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED. AND WHY WE HAVE SO MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE SO FRUSTRATED. HOW IS THAT JUST. IF YOU COULD JUST EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T HEAR THAT IN YOUR PRESENTATION PLACE. YES SORRY I DIDN'T TO PROVIDE A CALL CENTER UPDATE THIS TIMES THAT I DID AT THE LAST HEARING BUT- WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TRAINING- RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THAT TRAINING WERE PUTTING ON HOLD WHILE WE WORK THROUGH THE BACKLOG. BUT AS SOON AS A BACKLOG IS CLEARED WE'LL BE DOING EVEN MORE TRAINING. AND NEWSLETTERS WE ALSO I IMPLEMENTED OVER THE SUMMER. A DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO PEOPLE COULD QUICKLY FIND ANSWERS AND BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO OUR AGENTS. WERE ALSO- MERGING OUR CALL CENTER- AND PROVIDING SKILL BASED ROUTING- IN THE NEXT WEEK I THINK- OCTOBER TWENTY SECOND. OF WHICH WILL HELP CLAIMANTS GET TO A PERSON IS TRAINED IN SPECIFIC AREAS. SO WE TAKE THE CALL CENTER WERE REALLY WORKING HARD TO. MAKE SURE IS AN EXCELLENT- SERVICE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. GOT IT AND WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE JUST TO THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT THAT ACTUALLY SAID WHEN THEY WENT TO SOME OF THESE CALL CENTERS THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T PICKING UP THE PHONES. AND NOT ANSWERING PHONES BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING FOR A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS AROUND THE STATE WHO WERE. TRYING TO GET ANSWERS AND SO IF YOU HAVE. A RESPONSE TO WHY PEOPLE WEREN'T PICKING UP. THE CALLS AT THESE CALL CENTERS YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS ARE HIRED. TO ANSWER THESE CALLS AND NOBODY'S ANSWERING THE CALLS AND- AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOME DISCREPANCY BECAUSE PEOPLE STARTED WORKING FROM HOME BUT THERE SHOULD STILL BE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR ACTUALLY DOING THE JOB. ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WORK AT THAT ARE IN THE OFFICE OF. THE WORKING IN THE CALL CENTER- ALSO DO CLAIM FILING. SO THEY'RE NOT ON THE PHONE ALL THE TIME I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE STRIKE TEAM SAW AT THE TIME. BUT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT ANSWER PHONES ARE WORKING FROM HOME THROUGH OUR VIRTUAL NETWORK. WE HAD WE HAD IS A MUCH SMALLER AMOUNT A STATE WIDE IN OFFICES OR ANSWERING PHONES. AND AGAIN THOSE PEOPLE WERE ALSO DOING CLAIMS FILING- SO THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT ON THE PHONE FULL TIME. AT ANY POINT SO AT. I WASN'T THERE SO I CAN'T I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT WHAT THEY- CAN YOU DO CAN YOU SPEAK TO PERHAPS THE METRICS USED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THEIR JOB IN. RESOLVING SOME OF THE NOT ONLY ANSWERING THE PHONES FOR RESOLVING SOME OF THE CLAIMS. WHERE THEY'RE ON THE CALLS. JUST A LITTLE TRICKS YOU USE AND THE RESPONSE THAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE DOING. THEIR JOB ALREADY DD. UP YES SO I MEAN I DON'T HOW THOSE METRICS RIGHT ON ME BUT- NEEDLESS TO SAY OF ALL THE FOLKS WORK. UNDER MANAGERS THAT MONITOR VERY CLOSELY. AND WORK WITH EACH PERSON TO DEVELOP THEIR PERFORMANCE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE- AT MEETING OR EXCEEDING PERFORMANCE AND IF THEY'RE NOT THEN- ADDITIONAL TRAININGS PROVIDED. YOU KIND OF CORRECTIVE ACTION. YOU KNOW ANYTHING SELL. AND I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THIS BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE FRUSTRATIONS I HEAR FROM A DIFFERENT CALIFORNIANS UP AND DOWN THE STATE YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO KNOW LIKE WHO'S BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE ARE THINGS BEING DONE WHEN THEY READ REPORT WHERE YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID NINETY EIGHT POINT 6% OF. PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THEIR ISSUE RESOLVED AT LEAST ON THAT FIRST PHONE CALLER EVEN SUBSEQUENT CALLS I BELIEVE THE CHAIRMAN ASKED EARLIER- WHAT'S LONGEST BACKLOG BUT STILL MONTHS. ONCE WAY HERE WE ARE YOU KNOW ALMOST HALF A YEAR LATER SIX MONTHS IT'S PEOPLE ARE OBVIOUSLY STILL FRUSTRATED. SO IF I COULD GO BACK AND TELL THEM LOOK THESE ARE THE METRICS IS OUR MAKING SURE THAT. EDT IS BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN THE PEOPLE ARE ANSWERING IN RESOLVING CASES- YOU KNOW THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY I THINK- FOR THE COMMUNITY OR FOR CALIFORNIANS. YEAH ONE OF THE BIGGEST IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING- THIS WAS- BASED ON- WORKING WITH OTHER VENDORS THIS SPRING. WAS WERE IN THE PROCESS OF INSTITUTING A COMMAND CENTER OVER OUR CALL CENTER. AND PUTTING IN- WHOLE SOFTWARE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO- ACTUALLY COMPILE METRICS. WE JUST HAVE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT SO-WE'RE REALLY MOVING TOWARDS THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. AROUND THAT SO SOON. OKAY GREAT I THINK WE HAD WHO WE APPRECIATE SOME OF THAT MAYBE IT'S ON THE DASHBOARD SO THAT ACCOUNTABILITY OF THOSE METRICS THAT ARE BEING USED- WOULD BE GREAT I THINK AS FOLLOW UP. BUT MY SECOND QUESTION WAS REALLY CENTERED ON YOU GUYS HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT ID ID MEDIANET. BEING ABLE TO RESOLVE A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE SAYING OVER AT EDT- OBVIOUSLY- WE'VE BEEN SEEING A LOT OF MEDIA ACCOUNTS AND EVEN THEIR OFFICES HEARING OF A LOT OF CASES- FOR INSTANCE WHERE SOMEBODY'S BEING MAILED. YOU KNOW TEN LETTERS OR MULTIPLE EDT DEBRA CARDS TO ONE ADDRESS AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHY OVER EDDIE EDT THIS WASN'T FLAGGED IN THE FIRST PLACE TO SAY LOOK THERE'S GOT TO BE AN ISSUE HERE. IF TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY. YOU KNOW DEBIT CARDS ARE BEING MAILED TO ONE ADDRESS OR OR LETTERS ADDRESSED TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE BUT STILL GOING ONLY TO ONE ADDRESS. NOW IS IT ME GONNA FIX ALL OF THAT. YES IT DOES ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW AT THE VERY GET GO AT THE FRONT END WHO WORK THERE THAT PERSON WE'RE DEALING WITH IS THE PERSON. OF ACT THAT WILL HELP. GOT IT NOW AND NOW. THE BIG QUESTION WHY THAT WASN'T DONE BEFORE BUT LET'S SET THAT ASIDE FOR A SECOND. WHAT IS BEING DONE TO MAKE SURE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO CAPTURE THE FRONT END BUT ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING IN THE BACK AND WITH INVESTIGATORS OR ANYTHING ELSE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE- FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. OH ABSOLUTELY SO AND I HAND OUT THAT I PROVIDED YOU EARLIER THERE'S A SECTION ON FROGS AND LYFT THAT'S WHERE INVESTOR DICTATORS COME IN AND THEY WERE UTILIZING A VARIETY OF TOOLS WHETHER IT'S FRONT THROUGH OUR DEPARTMENT OF LABOR- IF I MEAN I SCRIPT TRYING TO LIST IT ALL THERE FOR YOU. BUT WE YEAH YEAH YOU KNOW WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE HAVE PLENTY UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE PLENTY OF LEADS. GO IT WOULD YOU BE ABLE TELL ME AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE DID ALLOCATE- RESOURCES AND MONEY. TO EASY EARLIER IN ANTICIPATION OF. THE CASES THAT WE DO BUT- HOW MANY MORE. INVESTIGATORS ON THE FRONT SIDE DID YOU HIRE A READY DD. WE DIDN'T ADD- MORE INVESTIGATORS. AT THIS POINT WHERE WE FEEL WE ARE FILLING BUT OF. OKAY IT WOULD YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH MONEY TAXPAYERS OF LOST DUE TO SOME OF THESE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. NO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE TRACK. OKAY IT'S A LITTLE IS BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD MAN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS HELLO MISS BETWEEN NORTH. GUESTS WILL COME BACK TO THAT TOPIC NINETY THAT YOU FOR THE PROMPT CONVERSATION- THE BIT TECH- A TIME. THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SO FIRST JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU SECRETARY RICHARD SEND OFF FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND- ALSO FOR THE AT. THE WORK OF YOUR CO LEAD MS PODCAST AND DOES YOUR ENTIRE TEAM AND SHE SAID WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY AROUND THE CLOCK IN ORDER TO. ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL ISSUES AND I BEGIN TO MAKE PROGRESS AND- START TO DO A BETTER JOB SERVING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WE DO. GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT I'M JUST I WANT TO START WITH A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE SECRETARY AROUND ID ME SO. THAT WE HEARD THE L. A. O. IN IN HIS AT IN YOUR TO AN ALLEY OWES TESTIMONY. MISTER ALAMO AND MENTIONED THAT THEY HAD ID NEED TECHNOLOGY COULD HAVE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED YEARS AGO. I SECRETARY RICHARDSON. DO YOU SHARE THAT ASSESSMENT. AND IF. HI THIS IS A- IN THE AGAIN I- WANTED TO SEE IF IT'S OKAY FOR ME TO- COVER THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON BEHALF OF US SECRETARY RICHARDSON. YES PLEASE THANK YOU. YES FROM A STRIKE TEAM- ASPECT THE IDENTITY VERIFICATION- YES THE MAIN CAUSE FOR A LOT OF THE BACKLOGS. AND THE NEED FOR IMPROVED THAT AT THE VERY FIRST STEP IS SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY BASED ON THE STRIKE TEAM ASSESSMENT THERE'S EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THAT. I WOULD SAY DIED- YES WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW POPE THAT THIS WAS IMPLEMENTED EARLIER BUT I THINK- IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY THAT WITH THE A STRIKE TEAM WE HAVE TRUE EVIDENCE AND DATA SUPPORTING THAT DECISION SO. IMPLEMENTING RIGHT NOW IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND FIVE. MIKE MY COLLEAGUES AND AS A MEMBER CHIU RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ID ME IS LIVING UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE STRIKE TEAM. I JUST PROVIDE US A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ON THAT FRONT THAT IS THE IMPLEMENTATION FAR. MEETING YOUR EXPECTATIONS AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS ARE ACTUALLY BEING RESOLVED AUTOMATICALLY BECAUSE OF THE IMPLANTATION OF ID ME. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I DO THAT BUT WHAT'S WANTED TO HAVE A CHANCE TO CLARIFY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE REFERENCE ON THE PERCENTAGE WELL AS WELL- I LIKE TO SEPARATE OUT TO PERCENTAGE THAT AND- BEING USED IN REFERENCE ONE IS DE ID MEANS. PERCENTAGE OF NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL WHO APPLY FOR VERIFICATION OF THEIR IDENTITY AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO PASS THAT THE DENTAL T. WAS THE SUCCESSFUL- APPROVAL OF SIXTY FOUR AND AS OF TO DATE THAT ALREADY ONE UP TO SEVENTY PERCENT. THAT PERCENTAGE IS DIFFERENT THAN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS OR THE PERCENTAGE THAT- THE STRIKING REPORT HAS STRIVE FOR AUTOMATION- AT T. WHICH YOU HAVE SEEN AS NINETY ONE OR 94% SO THE KEEP THINKING OF THIS WAY OF INDIVIDUAL WHO APPLY FOR ID NY IS SEEKING A VERY STEP TO GETTING THEMSELVES DOWN TO FIND THROUGH A VERIFICATION PROCESS. THEY MAY OR MAY NOT IMMEDIATELY GO TO YOU I ONLINE AT EIGHTY TO APPLY FOR A CLING. SO THAT PERCENTAGE AS OF- SHARON HAS MISSION. WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH EDT AND EDP IS MONITORING THAT ON A DAILY BASIS TO SEE HOW THAT PERCENTAGE IS BEING ACHIEVED. BUT THE NINETY ONE NINETY FOUR PERCENTAGE IT'S ABOUT THE U. I. ONLINE NOT THE SAME AS THE ID NEED VERIFICATION PERCENTAGE WHICH CURRENTLY IS SIXTY FOUR TO SEVENTY PERCENT. AND AS IN JUST FOR THE MOTHER POINT OF REFERENCE- ID ME IMPLEMENTATION IT'S AT A NATIONAL LEVEL- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE FEDERAL VETERANS AFFAIR. AS WELL AS SOCIAL SECURITY MINISTRATION JUST TO NAME A FEWHAVE IMPLEMENTED IT AND SEVERAL OTHER STATES. SO ON THIS NATIONAL AVERAGE THE PASSING RATE OR SO SAYS IS HOVERING AT ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT. AND FOR THE STATE THAT HAVE YOU KNOW HIGHER PERCENTAGE OR COMPLEXITY POTENTIALLY DUE TO FRAUD. THE AVERAGE THAT WE HAVE SEEN IS HIRING BETWEEN SEVENTY TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. SO WITH THAT. FROM THE EARLY INDICATION THAT WE HAVE SEEN WE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE HAPPY WITH THE- PASSING RATE OF. 70% ACHIEVED BUT AT ANY. OKAY ALL RIGHT ANDERSON THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'M AND FIVE DIRECTOR HILLIARD COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YEAR- SO. I'M NOT TOO TO BE LOOKING BACKWARDS BUT I THINK I'M JUST TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND. AT THE ASSESSMENTS IN THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT AND REALLY WHERE WE GO FROM HERE SO WHEN WE HAVE HAD WE'VE HAD TWO PREVIOUS HEARINGS AND- YOU BLAMES THE DEPARTMENT BACKLOG AND THAT THE FIVE ISSUES IN THE NIGHTMARE THAT WAS UNFOLDING AT U. D. D. ON TWO THINGS YOU BLAME IT ON THE LEGACY SYSTEMS. ISSUES AND THEN YOU BLAMED IT ON A LACK OF STAFFING AND WERE FIVE MOVING TO HIGHER AND I THINK ACTUALLY DID HIRE SOMETHING LIKE FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE AS I READ THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY A FUNDAMENTAL REBUKE. OF BOTH OF THOSE STRATEGIES ARE BOTH OF THOSE ASSESSMENTS SO. AND IT NUMBER ONE IS THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT POINTS OUT THAT THIS BACKLOG IS DO YOU. NOT TO OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY BUT TO OPERATIONAL SHORTCOMINGS SO DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT WELL FIRST OF ALL IT AT. IT'S MORE OF THE CHECK I SEE IT MORE OR THE TECHNOLOGY WHERE THE ID ME WAS SO INSTRUMENTAL BECAUSE ONCE THE WAY PROGRAM CAME INTO PLAY I'M FROM AN OPERATIONAL STANDPOINT IT WAS A VERY SLOW PROCESS SAYING THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE CORRECT TOOLS TO HELP WITH OPERATIONS. AND THEN ONCE WE DID WE IMPLEMENTED RECENTLY- THAT'S JUST PUTTING US IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION. OKAY AND I IN TERMS AS THE HIRING OF HE HAS THOUSANDS OF NEW STAFF MEMBERS THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT POINTS OUT THAT THAT WAS NOT ONLY JUST A TOTAL WASTE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS BUT THAT IS ACTUALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND FIVE. ULTIMATELY MADE THINGS EVEN WORSE SO AND THEY ADVISE YOU TO STOP HIRING THOSE PEOPLE I GUESS TWO QUESTIONS. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT AND NUMBER TWO WHAT IS THE PLAN NOW WITH THOSE FIVE FIVE THOUSAND NEW PDT STAFF MEMBERS. SO IT WASN'T A MATTER THAT WE DIDN'T NEED EVERYBODY IT WAS A MATTER OF HOW WE WERE- ALLOCATING OUR STAFF- AND WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO TACKLE THE BACKLOG. SO WE DO NEED ALL THESE PEOPLE AND- OUT WE JUST MOVE THEM TO DIFFERENT% AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY UNTIL SUCH TIME TO GET TO THE BACKLOG AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO THE TRAIN THEM. NOW WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE STILL WITH US FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER BRANCHES WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT THAT WILL BE RETURNING OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS SO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE HIRED THAT- ARE ALREADY HELPING TO MITIGATE AND BRING DOWN THE BACKLOG. THAT'S NOT SOME OF THE LESS COMPLEX STUFF BUT NO THERE NEVER THE LESS IT'S ALL GOES TO THE BACKLOG I WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP THEIR TRAINING AGAIN FOLLOWING THE BACKLOG BEING BURNED DOWN. SO AGAIN THAT. IT IS EVERY SINGLE PERSON IS NEEDED- IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HOW WE WERE UTILIZING- AND ALLOCATING OUT THE WORK. I THINK I AM I WOULD I WOULD SAY AND WE CAN UNFORTUNATELY IT SOUNDS IT LOOKS LIKE SECRETARY RICHARDSON'S NOT HERE SO PERHAPS WE CAN GET ONE OF THAT DISTRICT TEAM FOLKS TO CLARFY THE ASSESSMENT BECAUSE- THE WAY THAT I READ THE ASSESSMENT. IS THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF A RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY FIX FOR IDENTITY VERIFICATION THAT WOULD HAVE. IT YOU HAVE KEPT 40% OF CLAIMS FROM GOING TO MANUAL PROCESSING WOULD HAVE OBVIATED THE NEED. TO HIRE. THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL STAFF MEMBERS THAT THAT WAS HOW I READ DISTRICT TEAM ASSESSMENT WHICH SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT THAN. YOURSELF AB. AND SO I GUESS JUST MIGHT MY FINAL QUESTION IS THAT THE STRIKE TEAM AB REPORT NEEDS THE TAG IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THESE TACTICAL ISSUES. IN ORDER TO MOVE EDT FORWARD THERE NEEDS TO BE A SHIFT IN CULTURE AND A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE THE RIGHT LEADER TWO OCCASIONS THAT SHIFT IN CULTURE AND TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE TO GET THIS DEPARTMENT ON TRACK. YOU KNOW I ABSOLUTELY DO BELIEVE I'M THE RIGHT LEADER AND I HAVE TO SAY WITH THE NEW APPOINTMENTS OF ART TO NEW CHIEF A DEPUTY DIRECTORS AND OUR- LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR AS WELL AS OUR NEW GENERAL COUNSEL. HAS ALREADY BROUGHT ON SOME GREAT IDEAS TO THE FOREFRONT ANDWE'RE STARTING TO RE LOOK AT THINGS THINGS AND WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T BEFORE. I HAVE TOTALLY EMBRACED IT I- I APPRECIATE THEIR INPUT AND THEIR GUIDANCE AND WE- ARE FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE AND AS A COLLECTIVE YOU KNOW. MAKING DECISIONS AS A COLLECTIVE BODY. I THINK WE'RE ON A GOOD PATH. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY JUST ONE QUESTION FOR MR BEFORE YOU OUR SECOND PANEL. REGARDING YOUR TWENTY SEVEN INVESTIGATORS. HOW MUCH FRAUD HAVE IDENTIFIED SO FAR I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER OF FRAUD WE RIGHT NOW HAVE SEVENTY FIVE ACTIVE INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON- AND- LIKE I SAID WE HAVE TWENTY SEVEN WE DIDN'T ADD A LOT OF RESOURCES BUT WAIT THEY ARE CONTINUING TO HIRE. UNFORTUNATELY HIRING PEACE OFFICERS IS A VERY LONG PROCESS OF BUT THEY ARE ARE IN THE HIRING MODE. OKAY WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND SWITCH TO OUR NEXT PANEL IN HOPE OF SORRY MISTER NAZARIAN. OKAY ONE OKAY. SO WE'RE GOING TO SWITCH TO OUR OUR SECOND PANEL IN OUR SECOND PANEL. WE HAVE LISTER FRIEDMAN THE MAYOR OF CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS AND ALSO MARK- PUT WHO THE SYSTEM CHIEF OF POLICE FOR THE CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THE SECOND A POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND THERE ARE FEW OTHER REMOTE LOCATION INVENT NICE. MISTER MAYOR CAN YOU HEAR ME. YOU HEAR ME YES. OKAY GO AHEAD AFTER MAYOR OKAY WE JUST STARTED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MAYOR LESTER FRIEDMAN FROM THE CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO REPRESENT BEVERLY HILLS HERE TODAY FOR THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED BUSINESS DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND BEVERLY HILLS IS NO DIFFERENT. WE'VE SEEN MANY STOREFRONTS CLOSED PERMANENTLY WHILE OTHERS HAVE DRAMATICALLY TRANSFORMED TO MEET NEW HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. AMID THESE CHANGES WE ALSO SAW AN INCREASE IN TRAFFIC AND PARKING VIOLATIONS THE OPEN USE OF MARIJUANA IN PUBLIC. AND THE APPEARANCE OF ILLEGAL STREET VENDORS AND GAMBLING ON OUR ICONIC RODEO DRIVE. AS OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT INQUIRED FURTHER OUR MERCHANTS ADVISED THAT THEY HAD SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CASH PURCHASES. AS WELL AS THE FREQUENT USE OF EDT CARDS. THIS BEGAN THE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY BY OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT TO PROBLEM SOLVE AND ADDRESS THE CRIMES THAT WERE OCCURRING ON RODEO DRIVE AND THROUGHOUT OUR BUSINESS DISTRICT. WITH THE CHAIRS PERMISSION I'D LIKE TO TURN TO OUR ASSISTANT CHIEF OF POLICE MARK COOPER WOULD. TO DISCUSS THE PROACTIVE STEPS WE TOOK TO MITIGATE THESE CRIMES AND THE UNFORTUNATE MISUSE OF CRITICAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRPERSON COOPER CAN YOU HEAR ME OK IT'S LIKE YEAH. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING THE MAYOR AND I THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO OUR COMMUNITY AND BEVERLY HILLS AS NEVER EXPERIENCE THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST SIXTY DAYS TO THIS LEVEL AND WE REALLY RECEIVED DAILY COMPLAINTS FROM ALL FACETS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AS A RESULT WE TOOK A GROUP OF OFFICERS LED BY A SERGEANT AND REALLY ASK THEM TO GO DOWN TO OUR BUSINESS DISTRICT. AND TO USE THE FAMOUS SERRA MODEL OF PROBLEM SOLVING THROUGH COMMUNITY OR ANY POLICING. WHAT IS THE SERRA MODEL WE SCANNED THE PROBLEM WE ANALYZED WHAT WAS PROBABLY. CREATING THE PROBLEM. WE RESPONDED TO THE PROBLEM AND NOW WE'RE IN THE ASSESSMENT PHASE WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT. WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHAT HE CAN DO TO HELP RESOLVE FURTHER ISSUES AND REALLY TO MITIGATE. FUTURE OF CURRENTS IS OF IN MY TWENTY SIX YEARS THE MOST. YOU KNOW THE MOST FRAUD I'VE EVER SEEN- WITHIN A SIXTY DAY PERIOD IN MY IN MY TWENTY SIX YEARS AND THAT INCLUDES MY TIME WITH THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. WHAT WE WERE SEEING WAS THERE WAS A THERE WAS A NEED TO MEET WITH OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY AS WELL BECAUSE WE REALLY HAD TO EDUCATE THEM ON WHAT THE FRAUD WAS THEY WERE SEEING- INDIVIDUALS COMING UP WITH- AS MANY AS FOUR TO FIVE FRAUDULENT EDT CARDS AT ONE TIME. AND THEY WERE COMING IN WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AT ONE TIME THROUGH THIS ERA MODEL AND DIFFERENT INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES THAT WE DEPLOYED. IN THE LAST SIXTY DAYS WE'VE ARREST OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE FREE DD FRAUD MOST ALARMING IS WE RECOVERED THIRTEEN FIREARMS AND WHY IS THAT ALARMING ALONG RODEO DRIVE THEY HAD NOT RECOVERED A FIREARM IN EIGHTEEN YEARS AND IN THIRTY DAYS WE RECOVERED THIRTEEN FIREARMS. WE WERE COVERED OVER TWO HUNDRED FRAUDULENT EDT CARDS WITH AN ESTIMATED STREET VALUE OF OVER FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WE RECOVERED OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN US CURRENCY. WE WERE COVERED OVER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF US POSTAL MONEY ORDERS. AND THE MOST ALARMING THING WAS WE WERE SEEING MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARRESTED WERE COMING FROM OUT OF STATE WITH NEW YORK LEADING THE WAY. GEORGIA NUMBER TWO AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAD SIXTEEN PEOPLE- THAT USED OF THAT AS THE RESIDENCY WE IMMEDIATELY SET UP A HOTLINE. TO TRY TO GET MORE INFORMATION FROM OUR COMMUNITY AND ONCE WE RELEASED ALL THIS INFORMATION INTO THE MEDIA WE HAD TO CREATE A HOLIDAY BECAUSE WE WERE RECEIVING CALLS FROM EVERYONE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THROUGHOUT THE NATION. WE CONTACTED OUR LOCAL OUR STATE AND OUR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS TO INCLUDE EDT. AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US WITH THE ADJUDICATION AND THE FOLLOW UP PIECES OF THESE CASES. AS YOU ALL ARE WELL AWARE OF IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD RELATED CASES ARE AND- ARE ARE VERY LABOR INTENSIVE AND THEY TAKE A LOT OF TIME FROM A DEPARTMENT OUR SIZE. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE HAVE PARTNERED FEDERALLY WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR TO ADOPT A MAJORITY OF OUR CASES. WE ARE GOING TO- HAVE THE REST OF- LOOKED AT THROUGH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DA'S OFFICE. AND WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH. THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AS WELL. WELL THIS ALL SEEMS POSITIVE I CAN TELL EVERYBODY WE WILL NOT ARREST OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. WE NEED TO SEE SYSTEMATIC CHANGES THAT ET D. THAT WE HAVE ALL GOT TOGETHER AND ARE GOING TO OFFER. SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE THINK WILL HELP ET DE. MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH EDT AND HELP THEM WITH SOME OF THE THINGS THE BRIGHTEST MINDS IN OUR INDUSTRY AT THE FEDERAL THE LOCAL ON THE STATE LEVEL HAVE OFFERED. WHAT ARE THOSE SOLUTIONS. I D. DOT ME VERIFICATION TOOLS A STRONG START WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING THESE CLAIMS EITHER THROUGH A GOVERNMENT ID LIKE A PASSPORT OR DRIVER'S LICENSE. THIS IS A BIG ONE THE NEXT ONE ALLOW ONLY ONE CLAIM PER APPLICATION PER IP ADDRESS. WE NOTICED ADDITIONALLY OUR FOLLOW UP WE'VE SEEN AS MANY AS A HUNDRED CARDS ISSUE. UNDER THE SAME I. P. IF ONE IP ADDRESSES ONLY ALLOWED PER ONE CLAIM THAT WOULD HELP A LOT. ALLOW ONLY ONE CARD TO BE SET TO ONE ADDRESS OR ONE PO BOX WE WERE COVERED AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED CARDS IN THE CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS. ALL IN DIFFERENT NAMES TO ONE ADDRESS. DISCONTINUE THE BACK PAY WE WERE SEEING SOME OF THESE CARDS BACK LOADED WITH ALMOST TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON. HAVE EIGHTY D. DEPOSIT THE MONEY INTO A LEGITIMATE BANK ACCOUNT. DISCONTINUE ALLOWING CASH WITHDRAWALS FROM THE ATMS WE WERE SEEING PEOPLE WITHDRAWING AS MANY AS A FELT AS MUCH AS A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CARD RIGHT IN FRONT OF US ON VIDEO AND LITERALLY THROWING THE ENVELOPES AWAY IN THE NEARBY TRASH BAND AND GRABBING THE NEW CARD OUT OF A NEW ENVELOPE AND WITHDRAWING ANOTHER THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE BANK OF AMERICA ATM. DISCONTINUE ALLOWING US POSTAL MONEY ORDERS TO BE PURCHASED WITH THESE CARDS. AND THEN LASTLY LET'S FIND A WAY TOGETHER TO REGULATE WHAT AID CAN AND CANNOT BE USED FOR WITH THESE CARDS I THINK WE ALL AGREE THE CARDS WERE NOT MEANT TO SHOP ALONG RODEO DRIVE. IN CLOSING WE APPRECIATE WE RESPECT AND WE KNOW THAT EIGHTY D. PROVIDES A LEGITIMATE RESOURCE TO PEOPLE WHO TRULY NEED THE HELP. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS A VICTIM. HOWEVER THE IDENTITY THEFT VICTIMS ARE ALSO GOING TO BE DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH OF THIS FOR MANY MANY YEARS TO COME. SPECIFICALLY NEXT YEAR THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE A TEN NINETY NINE. WITH INCOME THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE EXPECTED TO CLAIM. THAT IS NOT THEIR INCOME THEY DID NOT EARN THAT. BUT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK WITH THE IRS FOR YEARS TO GET THEIR NAMES CLEAR. AND AGAIN I WANT TO REEMPHASIZE THE CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS WANTS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. PLEASE INCLUDE US WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE DIRECTOR OF EDT- IN OFFER ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. AS FAR AS A LONG TERM SOLUTION. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. JUST REAL QUICK AND THIS IS A GOOD FOR THE BIG ISSUE WITH THIS AND OBVIOUSLY OF THIS BEVERLY HILLS AND WE'RE SEEING THIS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- SO I BELIEVE THE SYSTEM SHEILA THINKING FOR TESTIFYING ALSO THE MAYOR. BUT WHAT WAS ALSO WE'RE SEEING WITH THIS. ON A BANK CARD BECAUSE I'M I'M A FAR OKAY. I CAN WITHDRAW SILVA HER DOLLARS. MOST BANKS HAVE LIMITS ARE NO LIMITS THESE CARS. BUT YOU KNOW BACK TO THE I. P. AT ADDRESS AND ADDRESS OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE A WORKING FAMILY MAY HAVE TO. BUT I'M NOT SURE MY COLLEAGUES ARE OF THIS. IF YOU HAVEN'T OF. DELIVERY ON YOUR AD SO IF YOU. REQUESTED THROUGH THE STATES POSTAL. THEY WILL SEND YOU. A PICTURE. OF YOUR AS WILL BE ARRIVE THAT DAY OR THE NEXT DAY. SO WHAT'S GOING ON FOR OF USEFUL. IF I'M MISTER TO I'M BACK I'M USING ADDRESS. I WILL PLAYING IT AND HAVE A POST OFFICE IN ME A PICTURE OF YOUR IS COMING DAY SOME SURE TO LET YOUR- INTERCEPT MAIL. THE NEW INTO THAT RIGHT NOW SO FULL ARE DOING THIS BEING SENT TO HOUSES WHERE NO ONE LIVES THERE. YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THE SO THAT'S WHISKEY. IS INFORMED. THROUGH THE US MAIL SYSTEM YOU NEED WITH WATER YOU MAY. THAT'S GOING TO BE A. YOU SEE THE FOLKS ARE DOING THIS AND ALSO- SINCE BANKAMERICA SINCE THE DEMOCRATS ARE TO. TAKE A LOOK AT HOW MANY MONEY ORDERS ARE BEING GENERATED STATEWIDE AND THERE'S. ONE PLACE TO GO TO I'M NOT GONNA SAY THEY GET MOST THE MONEY ORDERS ARE AND WHERE IT WAS IN JUST I GUESS WE NEED TO TRACK RAISE MONEY- GOING BECAUSE THERE IS A TRAIL AND I KNOW HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A NUMBER OF. A FRAUD BUT- EIGHT IT CAN CERTAINLY IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS DID NOT. A BILLION DOLLARS A LOT OF MONEY OUT THERE AND I KNOW THE- THE ISSUE WAS INITIALLY PAY THE LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS FIRST AND GET THAT OUT THERE AND WE DID A BETTER JOB THAT THAT THEY'RE GETTING BETTER BUT- AT SOME POINT WE TO TURN TO THE FRAUD ISSUE. AND WITH TWENTY SEVEN INVESTIGATOR STATEWIDE. THEY CAN'T DO IT THEY'RE NOT DOING IT THEY WILL NEVER DO IT. GOD BLESS THEM BUT- IF FALLS ON LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THE SHOULDERS. OF THOSE FORCED TO DO IT WE'RE GOING TO DO MORE WITH THAT SO. MISTER LUCKY. YES THANK YOU WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS JUST NOT THE SIZE HOW BIG THIS PROBLEM IS AND MY DISTRICT ALONE WE'VE RECEIVED. NEARLY SIX HUNDRED FIFTY ENVELOPES THAT WE SUSPECTED FRAUDULENT BECAUSE THE NAMES OF THESE ENVELOPES THAT ARE ON THESE ENVELOPES NEVER LIVED AT THE ADDRESSES THEY WERE SENT TO. THESE ARE ALSO SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES NOT MULTI UNIT COMPLEXES SO THERE'S NO REASON FOR CONFUSION. MANY OF THE ENVELOPES HAVE AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THESE DEBIT CARDS FROM BANK OF AMERICA. WHICH ARE LOADED WITH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING. VERBALLY I WANT TO CREATE A VISUAL THERE IS ARE THE LETTERS RIGHT HERE. THAT WE RECEIVED IN ABOUT ONE MONTH. THIS IS MY DISTRICT ALONE WE HEARD THE EVIDENCE. SENATE AND. IT'S PRESENTED BY THE POLICE OFFICER- JUST PREVIOUSLY. IN BEVERLY HILLS I IT I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT STATEWIDE THIS IS A GARGANTUAN PROBLEM. I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST. THAT THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM FOR WHAT IT IS BECAUSE THESE ARE STATE RESOURCES THAT ARE GOING TO BE BADLY BADLY NEEDED AS WE'RE- GONNA BE FACING DEFICITS IN OUR BUDGET HERE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE NEED TO. INVESTIGATE AND HAVE THEM MITIGATION PROCESSES IN PLACE RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD SET UP WITH A TASK FORCE THAT COULD HELP UNITE LOCAL RESOURCES AS WELL AS BECAUSE OF STATE RESOURCES ARE WOEFULLY. UNABLE TO HANDLE THIS- PROBLEM AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD GIVE IT THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES BECAUSE THESE. CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. GOING WITHOUT ANY KIND OF INVESTIGATION IN MOST CASES. WE NEED TO DO BETTER THAN THIS OUR RESOURCES ARE. NEED TO BE RESPECTED AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE MISTER CELIS. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE BEST COVERAGE SAID IN A SPECIFIC QUESTION AND I BELIEVE IT'S THE SYSTEM G. FOR THE CHIEF AND MAYBE THE MAYOR BUT WHEN YOU INVESTIGATED THESE CASES IN YOUR OWN JURISDICTION. OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T HAVE A I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ID DOT ME I LIKE YOU D. D. IS NOW IMPLEMENTING LIKE HOW DID YOU. FIND THESE CASES WERE ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE AND FIGURE OUT WHY ET DE HASN'T DONE THE SAME THING. YEAH SO WE- IT WAS REALLY A CASE BY CASE BASIS WE- THE SHORT ANSWER IS WHEN WE MADE. THE WHATEVER INVESTIGATIVE STOP WE DID. WE NOTICED THAT THE CARD HOLDER I DID NOT MATCH THE PERSON THAT WAS DETAINED. AND THEN WHAT WE DID IS WE ALSO TOOK THE RECEIPTS FROM WHATEVER RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT- THAT. THAT THE MERCHANDISE WAS PURCHASED FROM AND WE'RE ABLE TO MATCH THE FRAUDULENT DEBIT CARD TO THE REALLY THE STOLEN MERCHANDISE OF THE MERCHANDISE THAT WAS PURCHASED WITH THE FRAUD SO DOES THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE WERE ABLE TO- IDENTIFY THE PERSON WHO WE HAD DETAINED. AND WE SAW THAT THAT WAS NOT- THE PERSON ON THE CARD AND THEN YOU REALLY- ASKED A QUESTION THAT SEGWAYS INTO THE FOLLOW UP BESIDES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO THE CARD IS REALLY- IN THE NAME OF. IS VERY CHALLENGING AND VERY LABOR INTENSIVE. GOT IT. SO WHEN YOU FIRST IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL HOW DID THAT HAPPEN WAS THAT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING IDENTIFIED FOR ME DEAR DID WAS THEY ARRESTED ON ANOTHER CHARGE. HOW DID YOU INITIALLY IDENTIFIED THE INDIVIDUAL AND WHICH LED TO OBVIOUSLY THE BIGGER DISCOVERIES. A LOT OF TIMES IT CAME FROM A CALL FOR SERVICE FROM OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY- SUBJECTS WOULD BE TRYING TO PASS A FOUR TO FIVE EDT CARDS AT ONCE AND THAT WAS A- A RED FLAG FOR THE BUSINESSES WE REALLY EDUCATED OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY FROM THE START. ON WHAT TO LOOK FOR WE DID A LOT OF PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS A LOT OF COMMUNICATIONS ON WHAT THE CARDS LOOK LIKE AND THAT THEY'RE ONLY SUPPOSED TO HAVE% ONE AND TO ASK FOR. A LEGITIMATE FORM OF ID TO VERIFY THE CARD HOLDER SO WE RESPOND TO A CALL FOR SERVICE IS ONE- IS ONE SCENARIO THAT WE HAD A LOT OF AND THEN THE OTHER ONES WOULD BE JUST GOOD OLD FASHIONED POLICE WORK WE'D MAKE A TRAFFIC STOP WHICH LED TO A LEGAL SEARCH OF THE VEHICLE. AND WE WOULD FIND THE EDT CARDS AND THE FIREARMS AND THE LARGE-AMOUNTS OF CASH CONCEALED WITHIN THE VEHICLE THOSE ARE REALLY PROBABLY THE TWO MOST. PROMINENT AND REOCCURRING- CASES WE HAD WITH THOSE TWO EXAMPLES. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT A MISTER CHAIRMAN PERHAPS WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE WE CAN ASK YOU D. D. AS A FOLLOW UP YOU KNOW WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD. FLAGS WHEN MULTIPLE THINGS WERE SENT TO AN ADDRESS LIKE MR LACKEY AS A WHOLE. KERRYON OF MAIL ALL. TO ONE INDIVIDUAL I JUST WHAT ARE WE DOING THAT ALSO FOR AS THE ASSISTANT CHIEF TALKED ABOUT. WE'RE TRYING TO USE FOUR FIVE DEBIT CARDS AT ONE SINGLE TIME AT ONE BUSINESS I THINK THEY SHOULD RAISE A RED FLAG SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TO. IDENTIFY THAT ARE HAVE THE FRAUD INVESTIGATORS LOOK INTO THAT. AND SO WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE. YEAH OKAY SO NOT NOTHING RIGHT NOW NOTHING RIGHT NOW FRONT. OKAY LAGOS MISTER NAZARIAN. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I HAD SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE FIRST PANEL AND BEFORE I START LIKE TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF THE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY THANKED- SECRETARY RICHARD SENATE MISS PARKER FOR THEIR WORK. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE SPEED AND THE- LEVEL OF DETAIL AND DEPTH THAT WAS PUT INTO THE STUDY. SO FIRST AND FOREMOST. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS OUT START WITH THE PROCESSING OF CLAIMS BEING SO SPECIALIZED AND COMPLEX THAT IT REQUIRES A- EIGHT HUNDRED PAGE TRAINING MANUAL. AND THREE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE SCHOOLING AND FORMAL TESTING. TO REQUEST FROM AN ENTRY LEVEL ACCOUNTING TECH TO AN ACCOUNT ONE AND ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS TO PROGRESS TO THE SUBSEQUENT TEARS AND THIS IS ALL PART OF THE STRIKE. TEAM REPORT. SO FIRST. WHERE ARE WE WITH NEW EMPLOYEE HIRINGS AT THIS POINT. MISS TAYLOR YES WE'VE HIRED ABOUT FORTY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE- TO DATE- WE STILL HAVE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE COMING IN AT THE TIME THE STRIKE TEAM MADE THEIR THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS WE ALREADY HAD A JOB COMMITMENTS MADE TO PEOPLE SO WE WANT TO HONOR OUR JOB COMMITMENTS. OF BUT AS OF THIS MOMENT WE'VE BROUGHT IN FORTY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE HOW MANY MORE WE GET A HIGHER. ABOUT A THOUSAND. ABOUT A THOUSAND MORE. AND REMEMBER WE DO HAVE TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE GOING BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL PRO AND TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. SO GIVE ME OF THE TOTAL OF FIFTY TWO HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND ARE GOING TO GO BACK SO WE'RE GOING TO BE LEFT WITH. THIRTY TWO HUNDRED. SO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW TODAY WE HAVE FIFTY SIX HUNDRED. WE HAVE EIGHTEEN- EIGHT LOW OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED THAT ARE FROM OTHER BRANCHES EIGHTY THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS. THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO GO BACK IN THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR MONTHS. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE LOIT- UNTIL THE END OF DECEMBER. SO WE'RE AT SEVENTY NINE SEVENTY ONE- RIGHT NOW AND THEN WE'LL WE'RE STILL BRINGING ON BOARD PEOPLE AND SO WE HAVE ABOUT ANOTHER THOUSAND TO GO. SO THAT BRINGS US TO ALMOST NINE THOUSAND. OKAY SO. YOU'RE GONNA BE AT A THOUSAND BUT OF THAT THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HUNDRED ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO THEIR BRANCHES AND I SUSPECT. ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED OR SO ARE WITH DELOITTE IS THAT ACCURATE. WELL HOW ABOUT NINE THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND WILL BE GOING BACK TO THEIR BRANCHES AND FIVE HUNDRED FROM BELOIT SO FIVE HUNDRED FROM THE WAY. OKAY. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT THE EIGHT HUNDRED PAGE TRAINING MANUAL IS UPDATED. WE HAVE A TRAINING UNIT THAT CONSTANTLY IS UPDATING OUR MANUALS AND IN FACT I THINK AS YOU. MAY REMEMBER OVER THE SUMMER WE CONTRACTED WITH THE COMPANY NAME ADVENTIST AND WOMEN MOVING ALL OF OUR TRAINING MATERIALS INTO. TRAINING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT HAS REALLY HELPED PEOPLE BE ABLE TO BRING UP THE INFORMATION THEY NEED AT AND I LOOKED AT HER FINGERTIPS. SO WE'RE TOTALLY TRANCE YOU KNOW TOTALLY AT. COOK UPDATING AND MODERNIZING OUR TRAINING MATERIALS SO THAT THE REALLY REAL TIME AND- YOU KNOW ALLOWS PEOPLE TO RESPOND QUICKLY SOME. WE'LL BE GLAD TO PROVIDE YOU THE SLIDE DECK ON IT AT A LATER DATE IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE ALL THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT THAT ENTAILS. I I'D BE VERY CURIOUS TO AND I BY THE WAY DON'T. APOLOGIES BUT I DON'T REALLY RECALL THE CONVERSATION FROM SUMMER HAVING TO DO WITH THE SPECIFIC ASPECT SO- I'M HAPPY TO REVIEW MY NOTES AGAIN BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING. BUT. I'D AND I'D BE VERY INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT'S BEING DONE BECAUSE I I'M I'M JUST WONDERING. IF THE NEW HIRES ARE EXPECTED TO. ANSWER QUESTIONS HOW WOULD THEY EVEN REPAIRED. TO PROCEED WITH OFFERING THEIR SUPPORT AND HELP WHEN THERE IS SUCH AN EXHAUSTIVE TRAINING MANUAL REQUIRED FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DIGEST. WHAT TRAINING IS ENTERED IF YOU DON'T DIGEST NINE HUNDRED PAGES AND- AND YOU WAIT TILL THE END TO PUT START PERFORMING WORK WITH. PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT- SKILLS DIFFERENT WORKLOADS- UP AND GIVE THEM TIME TO BECOME PROFICIENT THEY GO INTO TRAINING AND THEY ALSO HAVE MENTORS- AND THAT'S WHERE WE WERE HAVING A LITTLESTRUGGLE BECAUSE THE MENTORS WERE OR ALSO. ON THE OUR EXPERIENCE FOLKS SO. BUT IT DOES TAKE TIME AND IT TO IT IN ORDER TO HAVE A WORK FORCE UP AND RUNNING AT THE LEVEL THAT YOU NEED. I WHEN WE STARTED THIS WHOLE THING WITH THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WHAT WAS THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AT AT YOUR DEPARTMENT WELL AT WITHIN ARE YOU AYE PROGRAM OR A LITTLE OVER TWO THOUSAND. THAT'S IT OR THAT'S AT. SO IN ARE YOU OUR PROGRAM WELL I'M SEEING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE TO THE SEVENTY NINE SEVENTY ONE TOTAL THAT YOU HAVE NOW. AND MOVING UPWARDS TO ABOUT NINE THOUSAND WITH ANOTHER ADDITIONAL THOUSAND HIRES. COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES WHAT WERE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. WE HAD ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND IF YOU'RE COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES AND- IF YOU TAKE THE- NINE THOUSAND AND BACK OUT TE REDIRECT STAFF EMPLOYED THEN YOU HAVE APPLES AND APPLES. SO RIGHT WHAT'S RIGHT OKAY SO I'M ASKING THAT BECAUSE I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE IF ONCE WE GET TO NINE THOUSAND AND THEN WE CUT BACK BY ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED WE'RE WE'RE ROUGHLY AROUND SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED. SO ON AN ONGOING BASIS WE'RE GONNA HAVE SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. WHICH WE TREAT THE WHICH MEANS THAT THAT'S THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WE HAD AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. SO AT AND EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUALS ARE DWARFING THE NUMBER OF EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUALS. HOW IS THAT BEING MANAGED. WELL I- FOR ONE THING THAT NEW HIRES ARE LIMITED TERM BECAUSE WHEN THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT AND PROGRAM STARTED THE CURES ACT IT WAS TEMPORARY IN NATURE- SO AT SOME POINT THEY WILL OF. NOT BE WORKING FOR EDT ASSUMING THAT CONGRESS DOESN'T PASS SOMETHING IN THE END OF DECEMBER AND WE HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO TAKE ITS PLACE OR TO CONTINUE IT. SO OKAY AND WHEN DO YOU SEE THAT TAPERING OFF. ALL THIS WHEN. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY SIX MONTHS. A GOOD SIX MONTHS- ASSUMING IT'S NOT EXTENDED. SO WHAT AND WHAT WOULD THE NUMBER COME BACK DOWN TO WOULD IT GO BACK TO AGAIN TWO THOUSAND OR- IT COULD BUT WITH THE NEW TOOL THAT THE- STRIKE TEAM PROVIDED US. IT'S A BURN DOWN CHART I AS I REFER TO IT IS A PREDICTIVE MODEL WHERE WE CAN PUT IN INVENTORIES WORKLOADS AND STAFFING AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN BETWEEN THE WORKLOADS. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE USING MOVING FORWARD TO- MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT NUMBER OF STAFF- AT THE RIGHT LEVELS UP TO MEET ALL OF OUR WORKLOADS. RIGHT NOW IT SAYS WE NEED ALL OF THEM. K. BUT SAID. LET'S LOOK AT THINGS ON A ON A THIRTY THOUSAND FEET VIEW- THE STRIKE TEAM HAD MADE SOME EXTENSIVE NUMBER OF- DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS DO YOU WHAT DOES EDT OR DO YOU AND YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM AGREE WITH ALL OF THEM. YES WE DID AGREE WITH ALL OF THEM. JIM WHO'S GOING TO BE IN CHARGE WITH IMPLEMENTING ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WHAT TIMELINE. SO WE WILL HAVE A TIME LINE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE MONTH- AND WE'LL BE GLAD TO PROVIDE YOU ARE MATRIX- THAT THAT SHOWS ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL AS THE WHEN WE EXPECT TO IMPLEMENT THEM- MOST OF THEM AND I THINK NINETY ONE OF THE HUNDRED AND- ELEVEN R. I. T. US SOLUTIONS. OF SO R. I. T. BRANCH WILL BE- IMPLEMENTING THOSE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ARE YOU AYE BRANCH- AND OUR NEW CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR CAROL WILLIAMS- HAS OVERSIGHT OVER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL THOSE ON STRIKE TEAMS RECOMMENDATIONS. OKAY SO THEN THE NON NINETY PLUS SAFETY OF STRIKE TEAM TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE CULTURE OF DVD AND THE CHANGES THAT NEEDED TO BE MADE. EDT AGREE WITH THE ASSESSMENT. I THINK THE MAIN EXCHANGE OF CULTURE AND HOW WOULD THEY GO ABOUT CHANGING THE CULTURE. THE MAIN CULTURE CHANGE YOUR THEY'RE REFERRING TO IS REALLY AROUND- FRAUD AND- HOW WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BALANCE OF MAKING SURE WE PAY PEOPLE YET PROTECT THE FUND- AND THAT'S A TRICKY BALANCING THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT. SO AGAIN AND I THINK PART OF OUR CULTURAL CHANGE WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE AS WITH THE HIRE OF A NEW EXECUTIVE TEAM. THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER WITH OUR NEED TO CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTORS AS WELL AS A NEW CHIEF COUNSEL- AND NEW LEADS DIRECTOR- HAVE ALREADY SHOWN IMPROVEMENT BUT THE BRAND. NEW FRESH IDEAS AND A NEW LOOK AT THINGS SO I WELCOME THAT AND- THERE THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN EXTRAORDINARY AND WE'RE GETTING IN AND MAKING SURE THAT- IS REFLECTIVE IN A CULTURE. THAT WE'RE ALL PROUD OF. SO THEN I DON'T WANT. HEY BENEFITS SINCE AND SPEAKING OF THE FROM ISSUE. AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT WITH YOUR YOUR MORE. AS AS IT WAS POINTED OUT WITH SOME OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS THAT MORE OF THE- IT SEEMS LIKE THE APPROACH AND THE LEANING WAS TO- NOT PAY AND ASSUME THAT THERE'S FRAUD AND SO VERY FEW GO THROUGH EXHAUST THE VERIFICATION. WHERE WAS THAT COMING FROM WAS THERE A HIGH RATE OF INCIDENCE. FOR A FRAUD OR WAS IT- THE SPECIALIZED IN SPECIFIC REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHAT WAS. WHERE WAS THAT THINKING AN APPROACH BASED ON YEAH THAT THOSE ARE PERCEPTION- AND LIKE I SAID IT IS A VERY HARD BALANCE- I THINK WE'RE REALLY- FOCUSED IN WAS A COUPLE YEARS AGO THERE IS A NATIONAL IT'S CALLED SPRING BREAK BREAK CASE AND HIT THE UNEMPLOYMENT ASSIST AND- INSURANCE PROGRAMS HARD THROUGHOUT THE NATION- DEPARTMENT OF LABOR HAS- WAS THE ONE THAT REALLY LED THE CHARGE AND WORKING WITH ALL THE STATE'S. BUT THAT'S WHEN WE REALLY STARTED A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE REALLY STARTED SEE AN INFLUX OF- PEOPLE HAVING OTHER PEOPLE'S ID AND OTHER IDENTIFYING INFORMATION SO THEY COULD INFILTRATE OUR SYSTEMS WORKING REALLY BAD WAS WHEN CONGRESS PASSED THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED THAT BECAUSE IT HAS VERY LITTLE CHECKS AND BALANCES- AND MADE IT JUST YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY. THE ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT THAT THAT THE INCENTIVE WAS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE GETS PAID AND THAT WAS WHAT THEIR FOCUS ON THE% DOWNSTREAM THE FACT WAS THAT OPEN THE DOOR FOR FRAUD IN A WAY THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. SO THEN WHAT. WELL OKAY I WILL I WILL I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO MUCH INTO THE FRONT ISSUE RIGHT NOW. GOING BACK TO THE CULTURE ISSUE REASON WHY I WAS BRINGING IT UP AND YOU YOU SAID THAT IT HAS TO DO A LOT MORE FOCUS ON FRAUD I. THE REASON WHY I WAS BRINGING IT UP IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THE VERY IDEA VERIFICATION FOR THE CLAIMANTS AND THE FACT THAT THE SCANNER- IN THE VERIFICATION UNIT COULDN'T DETECT THE RED COLOR. AND HAT CREATED QUITE A BIT OF A BACKLOG BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO GO IN AND MANUALLY CONDUCT THAT. THE REASON MY ASSOCIATE THIS WITH CULTURE IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE. WEEKLY MEETINGS EXECUTIVE MEETINGS OR BI WEEKLY OR HOWEVER WAY YOU DO IT. YOU DISCUSS DIFFERENT ISSUES AND YOU SEE THINGS THAT YOU CAN POINT OUT TO THAT. ARE IN MASS CREATING A PROBLEM AND A HOLD UP. M. I AM JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SO OBVIOUS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED. AND CREATED SO MUCH BACKLOG. HOW WAS THAT NOT READILY SEEN OR OR COME UP IN YOUR MEETINGS I MEAN I SUSPECT YOU DO HAVE EXECUTIVE MEETINGS ON A RELATIVELY FREQUENT BASIS HOW WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT NOT IDENTIFIED AND BROUGHT UP. AND IT REQUIRED THE A STRIKE TEAM TO COME IN AND IDENTIFY IT. ABSOLUTELY I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SO. THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE HAD A PROJECT PORTFOLIO AND WE TRIED TO PRIORITIZE ALL THE PROJECTS ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE AND APPLY RESOURCES AS WE CAN WHO MAKE SURE THAT WORK- IMPLEMENTING. ALL THE APPROVED MENTAL DEFICIENCIES BUT LIKE ANY DEPARTMENT WEVE GOT MORE WORK AND THEN WE HAVE ACTUAL RESOURCES AND WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT. IT BECAME EVEN MORE CHALLENGING THAT'S WHY THE STRIKE TEAM CAME IN THEY ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN CAME IN AND BROUGHT IT DITION RESOURCES- BECAUSE I YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT THAT IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH OF US THAT WORK- ABLE TO ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES SWIFTLY ENOUGH. OUR FOCUS OUR PEOPLE ARE MAINLY ON ACTUALLY PAYING THE BENEFITS OF PRODUCING THE WORK. SO WHEN YOU'RE- YEAH. TRY TO REVEL. YOUR I. . SYSTEM IN YOUR PROCESSES AND EVERY FUNCTION- YOU KNOW WELL ONE FELL SWOOP IT. IS GOOD THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT JUST DOESN'T. BUT I'M POINTING OUT TO SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC THAT. I WOULD HAVE HOPED WHEN THIS IS CONTRIBUTING I THINK I REMEMBER SOMETHING ABOUT AROUND SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE LACKING OF THE PROCESS. SOME I'M NOT EXACTLY SOMETHING LIKE THIS ONE I WOULD HAVE ASSUMED WOULD HAVE COME UP. RELATIVELY QUICKLY OR OR AT LEAST WITHIN A MONTH'S PERIOD OF TIME WHEN IT BECOMES VERY NOTICEABLE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE. I WOULD EXPECT AND WE ENCOURAGE OUR EMPLOYEES TO- SPEAK TO THEIR MANAGERS AND REYES ALL ISSUES AND TALK ABOUT IMPROVEMENT- WE HAVE MANY COURSES ON BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT FOR ALL OF OUR STAFF THAT SORT OF. THE BASIS OF YOU KNOW OUR MANTRA- YEAH I WOULD HOPE SO TOO I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH EXACTLY THE ONE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT- YOU KNOW. ABSOLUTELY WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND WE ARE IT'S I MEAN AS A CONSTANT. OKAY THIS THIS WAS SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC IN THE END THE REPORT THAT DISCUSSED HOW. THE SCATTERED WENT WHEN THE DRIVER CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE WOULD BE SCANNED. THE RED INK DYE WOULDN'T BE PICKED UP. AND SO CERTAIN INFORMATION NEEDED TO BE MANUALLY AND PUT. SEVEN EIGHT THAT'S WHY I'M I'M JUST PICKING ON SOMETHING RELATIVELY SIMPLE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASILY NOTICED AND WOULD OF BEEN PICKED UP ESPECIALLY IF. MULTIPLE INCIDENTS REOCCURRING INCIDENTS HAPPEN TO THE POINT WHERE EMPLOYEES START TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER ABOUT IT. IT THAT NONE OF THAT GOT UP TO MANAGEMENT LEVEL AND ULTIMATELY TO YOU. NO IT DID NOT REACH ME- AND I WOULD HOPE IT TO ITDID GREAT- TO THE MANAGERS AND THAT THEY WERE ACTIVELY WORKING ON IT UP I CAN'T SPEAK TO IT. THAT I WASN'T AWARE. OKAY WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER DEAN. THANK YOU MR- THIS SO I WANT TO JUST JUST TALK TO LA- A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS ISSUE THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT REGARDING CULTURAL. SO IF AWAY COULD. THE STRUGGLE TO COME BACK. BECAUSE I HAD SIMILAR QUESTIONS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES. ON IT'S JUST REGARDING THE- PORCHER CAN YOU IDENTIFY IS SORT OF WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED AS YOU WERE- LOOKING OUT EDT TO GIVE US A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT WHAT WHAT WHY WAS THERE OF THIS CULTURE AND THIS FOCUS. ON FRAUD IN AT THE SAME TIME WE HAD A HUGE NUMBER OF CASES OF FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR SO SOMEHOW EVEN THOUGH THE CULTURE WAS VERY MUCHFOCUSED. ON FRAUD SOMEHOW THEY THEY MISSED ALL THIS FRAUD THAT WAS GOING ON SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU SAW. OF COURSE THANK YOU MR TANG. I SHOULD FIRST AND FOREMOST NOTE THAT. MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE CULTURE ET ARE SPECIFIC TO MY EXPERIENCE INTERACTING WITH APARTMENT ARE IN NO WAY CONCLUSIVE. AND THEN SECONDARILY I WOULDN'T WANT TO SEPARATE WITH A LONG STANDING. FOCUS ON FRAUD PREVENTION PER FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR THE STATE'S NORMAL UNDERLYING YOU IPROGRAM ON A SEPARATE THAT FROM FRAUD THAT'S BEEN SEEN WITH THE PO A PROGRAM THAT WAS PASSED AS PART OF THEIR KERR SACKED BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE TO. DIFFERENT ISSUES I THINK AND ARGUE SO FIRST RELATED TO. THE LONGSTANDING FOCUS ON FRAUD PREVENTION. IN IN IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH DVD IT'S CLEAR THAT. THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS READING INCENTIVES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PERTAINING TO MINIMIZING THE NUMBER OF OVERPAYMENTS- THAT ISSUES AND THAT GUIDANCE COMES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. AND AS ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS DO THAT ARE THAT ARE INTERACTING WITH WITH FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS THAT THAT DICTATE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT THAT THE PART WAS TAKING EFFORTS TO MEET THOSE. INCENTIVES AND MESSAGES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT SAID THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO EQUALLY PRIORITIZES THE PROMPT PAYMENT OF BENEFITS AND- SO WHEN WE COMPARED THE DEPARTMENT'S TREATMENT OF THOSE TO. HAVE WHAT'S SAY- TARGETS THAT THAT MAY BE IN OPPOSITION OR OR IMBALANCED- IT APPEARS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS TENDED TO PREFER FOCUSING ON FRAUD PREVENTION RELATIVE TO ISSUING- BENEFIT PAYMENTS IN A TIMELY FASHION. NOW TO THE SECOND POINT MR TANG RELATED TO FRAUD THAT'S RECENTLY BEEN BEEN UNCOVERED IN THE P. WAY PROGRAM AS BOTH THE THAT SECRETARY RICHARDSON AND- DIRECTOR SO YOU'D MENTIONED THE FEDERAL PROGRAM RECENTLY STOOD UP INCLUDED VERY FEW STEPS THAT WOULD LIMIT THIS SORT OF ACTIVITY- IF- A FRAUDULENT ACTOR HAD OBTAINED- IDENTIFYING INFORMATION FROM A PREVIOUS DATA BREACH. THEY COULD SUBMIT THAT INFORMATION THROUGH THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW FOR THE P. YOU A PROGRAM AND THE CLAIM COULD GO THROUGH CLEANLY THERE WOULD BE NOTHING BUILT INTO THE DESIGN OF THE CLAIM TO CATCH THAT FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY. NOW WHEN ET DE DID BEGIN NOTICING THE TRENDS IN THIS FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY MULTIPLE CLAIMS GOING TO A SINGLE ADDRESS I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE TRENDS LINES IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THERE WERE SOME INCONSISTENCIES. THEY TOOK SEVERAL STEPS TO NOT ONLY. STEP ESTABLISHED PRODUCERS AT THE AT THE OUTSET BUT ALSO TO REDUCE THE INCENTIVES SO THAT THE MAIN STEP THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT- STOPS AUTOMATICALLY CERTIFYING PRIOR WEEKS BENEFIT PAYMENTS. AND SO IN ORDER TO GO BACK LIKE GET TO RECEIVE A BACKDATED CLAIM UNDER THE POOL PROGRAM NOW- THERE'S ANOTHER TOUCH POINT WITH PD TO CONFIRM THE IDENTITY OF THAT CLAIM AND- AND THIS PREVENTS. A FRAUDULENT ACTOR FROM CLAIMING SAY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY WEEKS OF BACK PAYMENTS WHICH IS WHY YOU WERE SAYING TEN TWELVE FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR EDT DEBIT CARDS- THAT WERE BEING USED FRAUDULENTLY ALL SIGNS INDICATE AS OF NOW THAT THAT STEP. FATHER WAS INSTITUTED SEVERAL WEEKS AGO BY THE DEPARTMENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS- FOR THE P. AWAY PROGRAM AND LIKELY PRODUCING AND THAT THEY'RE NOT A FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY THERE. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION REGARDING THE PEE WEE PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY. WITH A PROGRAM WAS SET UP THERE ARE. THERE THE NUMBER FIVE THERE'S A LOT OF CONDITIONS THAT MAKE IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO. ENSURE THAT. THE ACTUAL PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO DESERVE TO CLAIM SO OR SO I DO UNDERSTAND THAT SIR THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. HOW DO SO BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS. HAVE YOU SEEN A SHIFT SO THAT THERE'S NOT MORE OF A BALANCE THAT YOU SAID YOU HAVE TO- SIMILAR INCENTIVES ONE ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO DO A- LOT TO PROCESS THE CLAIM AS WELL AS THE- OVER THE- OVER PAVE THE MINIMIZING OVERPAYMENTS. SO IF YOU SEE ME AT LEAST A SHIFT TO MORE OF A BALANCE SO THAT THERE IS MORE FOCUSED ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO PROCESS A CLAIM. I MUST SAY THAT I AM NOT IN A POSITION. TO HAVE SEEN A SHIFT INTERNAL ACT EDT AND WHETHER OR NOT IT IS OCCURRED OR IS OCCURRING- WHAT I WILL SAY. IS THAT THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT CLEARLY. ILLUMINATES THIS BALANCING ACT AND CLARIFIES THAT EDT HAS HISTORICALLY TENDED TO FAVOR FOCUSING ON FRAUD RELATIVE TO BENEFIT TIMELY PAYMENT. AND IN THIS REGARD WE BELIEVE THAT THE REPORT ITSELF AND THIS ASSESSMENT AND THESE FINDINGS ARE AT LEAST IN IDENTIFYING THE CULTURAL BALANCE THAT THE DEPARTMENT MUST STRIKE- SHOULD AT LEAST. THROUGH FACILITATE THIS CONVERSATION THE ONE THAT WE'RE HAVING HERE TODAY- GOING FORWARD SUCH THE LEGISLATURE CAN ALSOPROVIDE GETS INPUT ON WHERE IT WOULD PREFER THE DEPARTMENT LAND ON THIS BALANCE. THANK YOU I JUST WANNA GO BACK TO THE DIRECTOR HILLIARD. SO ON. IT GIVEN THE JUST THE L. L. AS I'LL JUST CALL AND OBSERVATION RATHER THAN A- DATA. BASE AND THE ONLY WAS OBSERVATION WHERE YOU HAVE THE- SIMILAR FEDERAL INCENTIVES FOR MINIMIZING OVER PAYMENTS AS WELL AS- ON MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE PAID IN A PROMPT MANNER. HAS THE DEPARTMENT STARTED TO MOVE. THE STAFF IN A MANNER SO THAT CLAIMS ARE GETTING PROCESSED IN A IN A FASTER. AND FASTER MATTER. DEFINITELY THROUGH ALL THE FISHING SEASON ID ME AND THAT THE WHOLE REDIRECTION OF PUTTING STAFF. EXPERIENCE STAFF ON THE COMPLEX CASES. I MEAN. IT YOU KNOW IT. THANKS STAFF OR PAYING BENEFITS TIMELY HIS ISN'T CREDIT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO US- NOW I KNOW THE STRIKE TEAM FELT THAT WE HAD A MORE PROPENSITY TO FRAUD- WE REALLY JUST BEEN TRYING TO. LET YOU KNOW BOUNCE BOTH AND BOTH ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO US BUT I WOULD SAY BETWEEN THE TWO- PAYING PEOPLE THINK PEOPLE YOU AYE BENEFITS- HAS A HIGHER NOT THEN THE FRAUD. SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ADDRESSING BOTH. BUT OUR TOP TOP TOP CONCERN IS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING BENEFITS WHICH THANK YOU IN A CAN YOU CAN YOU JUST FOR THE COMMITTEE JUST EXPLAIN TO US. HOW THAT'S BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE STAFF. HELLO THANK YOU. WE PROVIDE A NEWSLETTER. FOR CONCERTS EVERY. I SEND OUT DIRECT MESSAGES OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTORS COMMUNICATED IT I MEAN IT'S- IT'S ALSO IN OUR TRAINING MANUALS AS FAR AS THE IMPORTANCE OF PAYING BENEFITS. I MEAN IT'S THE LABOR IS EVERYWHERE- THOSE ARE ALL VERY BROAD- YEAH. COMMUNICATIONS I'M YOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WORK. WITH YOU BUT YOU ALSO HAVE DIRECT. SUPERVISORS TO SERVE YOU. HI WITH YOUR SENIOR TEAM. TALKED ABOUT IT AND TALKED ABOUT HOW TO GIVE THAT DIRECTIVE TO YOUR SUBORDINATES DOWN SUPERVISORS CENTER MANAGERS ALL AROUND THE STATE. RIGHT I HAVEN'T STARTED THERE YET I'VE STARTED WITH OUR GENERAL COUNSEL AND OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTORS IT JUST STARTED. WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AT ALL I'VE ALREADY AND LISTEN MY GENERAL COUNSEL TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF ALL THE BRANCHES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE YOU KNOW NEARING THE KIND OF DEPARTMENT WE WANNA BE PROUD OF. SO HE WILL USE YOU TALKED YOUR GENERAL COUNSEL TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING THAT'S- IN VIOLATION OF LAND. FORCES YEAH. I'M HAVING- MAKE SURE THAT- LOOKING AT ALL THE POLICIES THAT ITS IT'S- IT'S PROTECTING OUR CLAIMANTS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE DOING RIGHT BY THEM THAT'S THE INCENTIVE BEHIND IT. BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY- DIRECT. VERBAL CONTINUOUS. COMMUNICATION TO YOUR MANAGEMENT STAFF. NOT IN SPECIFIC WEEK IF WE YOU KNOW FRAUD 49% AND PAYING BENEFITS SERIOUSLY BUT IT IS SOMETHING I CERTAINLY COULD. OF LOOK AT AND I THINK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK AND- GIVEN THE STRIKE TEAMS REPORT THAT'S PROBABLY IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO BROADLY SORT OF LAY THE FOUNDATIONAL LOOK OF WHERE WE'RE GOING IN THE FUTURE I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION. THANK YOU I DID JUST COME BACK TO THE DASHBOARD I APPRECIATE THAT THE DASHBOARD WAS VERY MUCH. ON IMPLEMENTING THE BUDGET BILL THAT WAS PASSED FROM NOW AGAIN THOSE WERE SPECIFIC ITEMS TO BE IMPLEMENTED. BUT THEY DIDN'T LIMIT YOU FROM IMPLEMENTING ADDITIONAL ITEMS SO JUST IN LOOKING AT YOUR DASHBOARD MY HAVE A PULLED UP ON THE COMPUTER IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL. HOW IT'S WILL NOT DIFFICULT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL HOW LARGE THE BACKLOG IS UNLESS I STARTED SURFING AROUND YOUR- YOUR WELL DESERVE REASON WHY THE BACKLOGS NOT EASILY IDENTIFY HI FIVE WILSHIRE ON UP ON THE DASHBOARD. SO RIGHT NOW WE REALLY HAVE TO SET THE DASHBOARDS GOING ON WE HAVE THE DASHBOARD THROUGH AB ONE OH SEVEN AND WE ALSO HAVE THE DASHOARDS IT- WE HAVE NOW JUST PUBLICLY LAUNCHED AS A RESULT OF THE STRIKE TEAM. SO IT WAS OUR INTENT TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND RECOMMEND THAT WE REPLACE THE LANGUAGE IN THE ONE OH SEVEN. ALL UP WITH THE NEW DASHBOARD- PRESENTED BY THE- RECOMMENDED BY THE STRIKE TEAM BECAUSE WE FELT AND WE AGREED THAT IT'S MUCH MORE INCLUSIVE OF. YOU KNOW EVERYBODY BOTH PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW WORK THAT WE HAVE IN Q. AS WELL AS PEOPLE- STOCK- AND YOU KNOW DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO YOU KNOW. SO THAT WAS GOING TO BE OUR NEXT STEP WAS TO PUT A REQUEST AND IS TO LOOK AT- CHANGING REQUIREMENTS OF AB ONE OH SEVEN WITH THE AND REPLACING IT WITH THE NEW DASHBOARDS IT JUST GOT CREATED. THE NEW WITHIN THE DASHBOARD I'M I'M LOOKING AT YOUR POWER. H. FIVE IS. IS THE ONE UNDER THE NEWSROOM. THAT'S RIGHT YEAH RIGHT NOW SO THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS THE NEW DASHBOARD. THAT'S NOT PART OF ONE OH SEVEN THEN- THAT THAT THAT IS THE NEW DASHBOARDS WERE AS- RECOMMENDED TO THE STRIKE TEAM. AND THERE'S TWO TWO ONE ONE FOUR ONE FOR INITIAL CLAIMS ONE FOR CONTINUED CLAIMS. AND WHERE'S THE OTHER ONE OKAY BECAUSE YOU ONLY MENTION TO YOUR POWER POINT YOU JUST MENTIONED A NEW DASHBOARD. AND THAT'S WHEN I AND I. AND I BROKE DOWN TOO SO. TURN TO PAGE. SO SLIDE FIVE- IT TALKS ABOUT THE TO THE NATIONAL CLAIMS BACKLOG IN THE CONTINUE CLAIMS BACKLOG THERE'S TWO DASHBOARDS CURRENTLY BEING PRODUCED AND- DISPLAYED ON OUR WEBSITE. WE'RE THE SECOND ONE I'M I'M NOT SURE NEWS ROOM. SO I CAN SEE WHAT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AND I'LL BE GLAD TO EMAIL THEM IF YOU LOOK AT AGAIN I'M I'M AT THE- YOU SEE THE BULLET RIGHT AFTERWARDS ON YOUR OWN POWER POINTS AS THE NEW DASHBOARDS CAN BE LOCATED VIA EDIE'S NEWSROOM. YEAH HARBANS WEBSITE SO THAT'S WHAT I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT RIGHT WITH WEBSITE AMONG NEWSROOM. AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE NEWS ROOM THERE'S THE UNEMPLOYMENT. INSURANCE DATA DASHBOARD. SO THERE'S A DATA DASHBOARD THAT'S PART OF- THE WHAT'S IN THE NEWS. PRESS RELEASE IT YOU CAN SIT ON THE FRONT PAGE THEY'RE ALL SHOULD ALSO BE A LINK TOTHE TO- DASHBOARDS. ONE NINETY ONE FOR CONTINUED CLAIMS I THINK THE PART OF LINKS OKAY. YEAH THE SERVER SO I THINK- PHONE. THE CHALLENGES IS JUST OUT OF MY- NO MY MOTHER CALLING FROM SERVICE REITERATED. IS THAT IT IS. YOU'LL GET A BE NICE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO SEARCHING THROUGHOUT YOUR WEBSITE TO GO FIND THAT IT'S ALL IN ONE PLACE- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT HISTORIC TRENDS BECAUSE- I WILL CLICK ON THAT INFORMATION- ALSO IS THERE A REASON. WHY THE BACKLOG IS NOT ON THE DASHBOARD. THE BACKLOG IS ON THE DASHBOARD ON THE INITIAL CLAIMS AND CONTINUING CLAIMS THAT'S CLOSE ALL OF OUR THAT THE PDF FROM SORRY OKAY. IS THERE REASON THAT'S NOT ALL IN ONE PLACE. IT I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IF YOU HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS ON WHERE YOU THINK WOULD BE BETTER HOUSE DIED WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IT NOW I THINK. IT'S USING YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT IT'S HARD TO SPEND FIVE MINUTES AND YOU HAVE TO WALK ME THROUGH IT AND- I'M SITTING HERE ON YOUR WEBSITE DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS CONFUSING. THEY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DATA IS NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE. SO IT WOULD BE NICE TOO AGAIN TO HAVE IT ON ALL OF THE PLACE TO BE TO MAKE IT VISUALLY EASY TO LOOK AT- THE MORE LINKS OU DO- IT'S GREAT FOR IT ON DATA GEEKS WHO LOVE SPENDING TIME ON YOUR WEBSITE BUT FOR MOST. PEOPLE THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WOULD BE LOOKING AT AND THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND TIME DOING AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU DON'T HAVE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO PROCESS. A CLAIM ON YOUR DASHBOARD. OF WE DO HAVE A BURN DOWN CHART THAT WE WORK AT WHICH I REFERRED TO EARLIER IS NOT PART THE DASHBOARD BUT- WE CERTAINLY COULD PUT ON THE DASHBOARD SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I THINK I THINK COULD BE HELPFUL ON THE BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE MAKING PROGRESS AND THAT THAT THE CLAIMS ARE BEING PROCESSED IN A FASTER FASHION. YEAH SO THAT IT WOULD JUST BE IT WOULD BE BASED ON DATA RIGHT RIGHT NOW YOU'RE- YOU'RE TELLING US THAT BUT THAT THIS WHERE YOUR YOUR DRONE DATA WHAT COOPERATE THAT. GO GOING BACK TO THE JUST STAY STICKY WITH THE BACKLOG- YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU ANTICIPATE THIS ONE POINT SIX MILLION PERSON BACKLOG TO BE CLEARED BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT HOW LARGE WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE AT THE BACKLOG THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET TO- BIG BECAUSE IF THIS IS NOT A STATIC NUMBER BASED ON THAT PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME BUT I ASSUME. UNDERSTOOD YEAH CASES WILL BE COMING IN FOR HELPING ABOUT GLOBAL YOU HAVE IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. EXACTLY WE WILL NOT HAVE A BACKLOG AND THE NEW TOOL THAT I REFERRED TO BEFORE THAT- WE'RE ABLE TO PUT IN OUR RESOURCES PUT IN OUR WORK LOAD IN PROJECT. THIS WAS ATOOL THAT CAME OUT OF THE STRIKE TEAMS- EFFORTS- HAS ALLOWED US TO PREDICT AND PROJECT AND- FIGURE OUT HOW MANY STAFF ARE NEEDED SO ARE BURNED DOWN PLAN. TO LIQUIDATE THE BACKLOG THROUGH JAN IN JANUARY AND THEN MAINTAIN WORKING INVENTORIES MOVING FORWARD FROM HAT SO WE- YES WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANOTHER BACKLOG UNLESS OF COURSE YOU KNOW. THAT SOMETHING OUT OF OUR CONTROL CHANGES BUT AT THIS POINT WE'RE ON TRACK TO REACH YOU BURN IT DOWN AND BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN. GREAT SO IF I'M APPLYING FOR THE CLAYMORES EVEN CONSTITUENTS OF OURS APPLYING FOR CRIME IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THEN WE ANTICIPATE THAT THAT CLAIM WOULD BE FILLED IN A IN A TIMELY FASHION AFRICANS AS A LIKE THREE WEEKS. RIGHT THE THREE WEEK TIME FRAME YES OKAY. AND MANY REMARKS TODAY IT'S JUST. BUT A EVEN MORE WILL BE WITH HIDING IN PLACE YEAH I KNOW YOU KNOW FORTUNATELY WE NEVER GET JUST LIKE I'M SURE YOU NEVER REALLY GET TO HEAR ABOUT THOSE WE NEVER HEAR ABOUT US THE PEOPLE WHO GET PAID IN THREE WEEKS WE DON'T THEY DON'T KALRA RIGHT. RIGHT SO UNFORTUNATELY JUST JUST LIKE YOURSELF THAT THE CASES THAT WE HEAR ABOUT ARE REALLY THE MOST DIFFICULT TOUGHEST- YOU KNOW SET STATUS CASES SO KNOW MY ARE CAN TO ROUTE RECEIVE. SEVERAL PROCEDURAL CALLS FOR MORE RECENTLY REGARDING THE BANK OF AMERICA CARD SET UP AND SUDDENLY FROZEN. AND CAN GIVE US A SENSE AS TO SORT OF Y. Y. Y. ARE THEY BEING. AND YOU KNOW WO'S WHO'S ACCOUNT TO BEING. FROZEN WITHOUT SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT DIRECTED AT THEM DO WITH THE SYSTEM AND THAT THE BANK IS DOING. THIS IS PART OF- THE BANK OF AMERICA'S- FRAUD PROTECTION. SERVICES I GUESS- AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE MENTIONED THAT- B. OF A AND R. ET AND IT LABOR AGENCY WERE MEETING THIS AFTERNOON. TO WALK THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES SENSE AND LOOK AT THAT BALANCE AGAIN BETWEEN- YOU KNOW PAYING CLAIMS VERSES YOU KNOW FIGHTING FRAUD. BECAUSE SO WE'RE AGGRESSIVELY TAKING A LOOK AT THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE COULD BE HELPFUL I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE- YOUR WEEKLY CALLS WITH OUR VARIOUS DISTRICT OFFICES I THINK CAN BE HELPFUL TO. GIVE IT GIVE US AN UPDATE ABOUT WEEKLY CALL JUST TURN UP. YES WE UNDERSTAND AS WE'RE GETTING- A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CALLS COMING IN. HOW DO HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THEM. OKAY THANK THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. FROM THROUGH YOUR HOME ONCE ET DE REALIZE THAT'S FRAUD SUSPECTED BUT STILL DO YOU GUYS TAKE. IF WE IDENTIFY FRAUD HAS BEEN- SO THE COUPLE DIFFERENT ROUTES I MEAN IF IN MINISTRY TO FLEE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CORRECT PERSON ISN'T BING HARMED AND WE IT JUST THEIR ACCOUNT TO. ENSURE THAT IT YOU KNOW BUT THEY'RE BEING SEPARATED FROM THE FRAUDSTER AND THEN AS FAR AS THE FRAUDSTER GOES- IT IS ELEVATED TO OUR INVESTIGATION DIVISION. OF TO LOOK AT. PURSUING CRIMINAL ACTION. YOU HAVE NOT NO IDEA HOW MANY CASES YOU CURRENTLY HAVE PENDING. WE HAVE STE I KNOW WE HAVE SEVENTY FOUR OPEN CRIMINAL CASES RIGHT NOW- AT AT. SO THAT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE OPEN RIGHT NOW. PREPENDED MAKE HOW MANY EMPLOYEES WORK- TELECOMMUTERS WORK TO HOME. COUPLE THOUSAND MAYBE- ARE NOT MORE ABOUT AUDIT STAFF- AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE WERE HAD MORE MOBILE KIND OF. BUT NOW YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT THAT 78% WORKING AT HOME WHICH- THE ADDAMS KNOWLEDGES IT IS A CONCERN OF MINE OBVIOUSLY- MOST EMPLOYEES DON'T HAVE STATE ISSUED. LAPTOPS IS THAT CORRECT NO THEY DO- WE OUTFITTED ALL OF OUR FOLKS WHEN WE- WHEN THEY- BECAME TELEWORK CURSE SO WHAT PERCENTAGE I MEAN ALL SEVEN HOW MANY WORK AT HOME RIGHT NOW SO SEVEN THOUSAND WORKING OKAY. LARGE SO THAT 7880% HAVE STATE ISSUED LAPTOPS. OKAY YES ACTUALLY BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD BUT STILL IT IT'S DIFFICULT OBVIOUSLY IT WORK PEOPLE GET SET UP FOR ECONOMICS AND DIFFERENT THINGS SO THAT WORK IT IS A DIFFERENT AMOUNT SORRY AT HOME IT'S VASTLY DIFFERENT WORKING ON A LAPTOP AND GETTING THINGS DONE THE WORKING ON DESKTOP AND HAVING MONITORS AND WHAT NOT. WE PROVIDE DOCKING STATIONS AS WELL AS- MULTIPLE SCREENS- BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE IS A SUFFICIENT AT HOME AS THEY ARE IN THE OFFICE. SO IT DEPENDING ON THE WORK KIND OF WORK THEY'RE DOING WE MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE PROPER EQUIPMENT TO PERFORM IT AS IF THEY WERE IN OFFICE- BUT I MEAN IT'S A GOOD THING COMMITTEE FOR THAT BECAUSE MOST STATE AGENCIES DON'T DO THAT AND EVEN HERE THE CAPITAL. A LOT OF FOLKS THAT HAVE THEIR OWN DEVICES I'M SURE SOME EMPLOYEES WORKING. ON SMARTPHONES OR LAPTOPS BECAUSE YOU KNOW LET'S. WORK SHOULD PROVIDE THAT SO THANK YOU GUYS FOR DOING THAT FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES. MISTER KING. JUST ONE QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTION SO. REGARDING THE NEW PROPOSED DASHBOARD WAS KEBABS GOING TO BE SENDING A JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE LETTER. TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE- I KNOW IT IT WAS GOING TO START WORKING ON THAT NEXT. THAT WAS OUR THAT WAS I THOUGHT OKAY. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. MISTER JUNE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SOMEONE HAD GO BACK TO THE TOPIC OF FRAUD AND WE'VE LEARNED A LOT IN THIS HEARING- FROM THE BEVERLY HILLS ASSISTANT CHIEF THIS IS THE MOST PARTY SCENE IN TWENTY SIX YEARS FOR CALLING MR LACKEY SIX HUNDRED FIFTY ENVELOPES JUST IN THAT SUITCASE JUST FROM HIS DISTRICT. AND WE LEARN THERE ONLY TWENTY SEVEN STAFFERS IN THE EDT FRAUD UNIT- EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE CAPACITY TO HIRE OVER FIVE THOUSAND NEW STAFFERS FOR DEPARTMENT OF NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE ONLY SEVENTY FIVE ACTIVE ACT INVESTIGATIONS AFTER NEXT. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION IT'S PRETTY SHOCKING JUST HOW LITTLE WORK THERE SEEMS TO BE DEBT DOWN IN THIS AREA. SO THERE WAS A PRESS INVESTIGATIVE REPORT RECENTLY. THAT REPORTED THAT WITHIN YOUR DEPARTMENT YOU HAVE TO TERMINATE LEAST THIRTY THOUSAND ADDRESSES. WITH AT LEAST TEN SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ATTACHED TO. EACH OF THEM. AND I KNOW YOUR APARTMENT AS FAST ABOUT IT AND YOU HAVE REFUSED TO. DENIER CONFIRM WHETHER THAT'S THE CASE COULD YOU TELL US. IS THAT THE LEVEL OF FRAUD THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO AS I'M SURE YOU CAN APPRECIATE OF THE REASON WE DON'T SPEAK ABOUT THAT. TECHNIQUES OR USING OTHER NUMBERS THAT WE'RE USING IS WE JUST DON'T WANT TO TIP OFF FRAUDSTERS IF WE TELL THEM IF WE TELL YOU WHAT FOR DOING THE PUBLIC OVER DOING THE NOT JUST WORK AROUND THAT AND- COMMIT FRAUD. IN IN THAT IN THAT AREA. SO AND WE DON'T KNOW AND- YOU KNOW AT HINDER THE INTEGRITY OF OUR INVESTIGATION SO. I'VE HEARD THAT AS THE LINE FROM YOUR- COMMUNICATION SECRETARY- I REACH OUT TO YOU IN A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS OF THE PAST MONTH ON SEPTEMBER THE SECOND SEPTEMBER THE TWENTY FIFTH JUST ASKING QUESTIONS AROUND FRAUD. NOT RECEIVED ANY ANSWERS MYSELF NOT IN ASKING IF YOU CONTINUE TO IGNORE REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM ALL AGES LEADERS OR JUST SOME OF US WERE ASKING BUT WE HAVE QUESTIONS. MY PERSPECTIVE SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE PART OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS. IF SOMEONE'S BREAKING INTO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES AND STEALING PERSONAL PROPERTY. HE WARNED THE PUBLIC. YOU ADDRESS THE CRIME IF SOMEONE IS STEALING TENS OF THOUSANDS. OF PEOPLE I DON'T PEOPLE'S IDENTITY. HE WARNED THE PUBLIC YOU ADDRESS THE CRIME IF SOMEONE'S BREAKING INTO. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BANK ACCOUNTS YOU WARN THE PUBLIC YOU ADDRESS THE CRIME IN THIS INSTANCE. WE HAVE MULTIPLE CRIMINAL RINGS STEALING FROM TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IDENTITIES. FROM BANK ACCOUNTS FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY. IN YOUR APARTMENT HAS BEEN SILENT. AND YOUR YOUR DEPARTMENT'S BEEN SILENT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING YOU DON'T WANT TO OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT TO TELL FRAUDSTERS HOW TO DO THEIR JOB THIRTY DOING THEIR JOB BUT YOU'RE NOT WARNING THE PUBLIC ON THE LEVEL OF FRAUD THAT'S HAPPENED YOU GIVEN NO DETAIL ON THE TYPES OF CRIMES ARE BEING COMMITTED AGAINST PEOPLE SO THAT PEOPLE. CAN BE AWARE OF WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF PUBLIC NOW. IS WELL AS IN OUR I NEWS RELEASE EVERY THURSDAY. WE DRESS FRAUD EVERY THURSDAY ON WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO DO WHAT NEEDS PEOPLE NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR. SO YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE A LOT OF MESSAGING AROUND THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT UNLESS PEOPLE. KNOW THAT THEY CAN'T PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US. AND WE NEED THE PUBLIC'S- I ON IT AND UNDERSTANDING AND BEING ABLE TO. HELP HELP DEAL WITH THIS. NOW IT'S JUST A- SOME OF US WERE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THERE'S A MUSIC VIDEO. ON THE WEB WITH FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND VIEWS ON HOW EASY IT IS TO THE FRAUD EDT. ARE YOU AWARE THIS. YES. ON A DIFFERENT SIDE SO OUR DISTRICT STAFF. EVERY EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS WE WOULD TALK TO YOUR STAFF OF A WHAT TO DO WITH CONSTITUENTS WHO GET THESE ENVELOPES AND- WE HAVE OUR COLLEAGUE MR LACKEY WHOSE COLLECTED THEM IN A SUITCASE- ARE STAFFER TOLD. THAT IF OUR CONSTITUENTS DIDN'T WANNA PUT POSTAGE BACK ON THE LETTERS TO MAIL BACK TO DEPARTMENT THAT THEY SHOULD JUST THROW THE ENVELOPE AWAY. WHICH SELLS LATERALLY TANTAMOUNT TO DESTROYING EVIDENCE OF FRAUD. HOW IS IT THAT WAY OUR STAFF ARE BEING TOLD. SO WHAT WE'RE COMMUNICATING WHAT WE'VE BEEN COMMUNICATING TO THE PUBLIC IS THAT- IF THEY GUESTS TO GET THESE KIND OF ENVELOPES YOU KNOW SEND IT BACK TO AS RETURNED TO SENDER WHETHER IT'S TO EDT- FOR ON THE NOTICES OR WHETHER IT'S BANKAMERICA FOR THE BANK CARDS. IF FOR SOME REASON THEY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT THEY SHRED ALL THE EVIDENCE- IT AT IT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S UP TO THE INDIVIDUALS OUR COMFORT LEVEL WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO SEND THEM BACK BUT AT A YOU KNOW IF FOR SOME REASON THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE AT A VERY MINIMUM. MAKE SURE YOU SHRED. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A GOVERNMENT AGENCY SUGGESTING THAT CRIMINAL EVIDENCE BE BE SHREDDED- WE HAVE A COUPLE OF US WHO. USED TO BE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I WOULD JUST ASK MR LACKEY FORMALLY FROM THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OR- OUR CHAIRMAN MR COOPER A FORMER SHERIFF IF THAT MAKES SENSE- BUT I DON'T THINK IT DOES. LET ME ASK ONE ONE OTHER QUESTION YOU YOU STATED YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN STOLEN FROM THE STATE OR FROM A CONSTITUENTS NO IDEA OF THE LEVEL OF FRAUD. SO SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC UNTIL THE END OF THIS PAST MONTH EDT IS SENT OUT. NINETY FOUR BILLION. DOLLARS AND- I'M GONNA SIT RIGHT HERE BUT I'M SURE THERE'S BEEN AT LEAST OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OR FRAUD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS. BUT STRIKES ME IT'S SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE OUGHT TO INVESTIGATE. AND IF YOU HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN ONLY TWENTY SEVEN. ARE FOCUSED ON FRAUD. WHO'S GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE THIS IS BUREAUCRATIC CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE. AND THE FACT THAT INTERESTS THE FACT THE ATTERS THIS IS ALSO IT WASN'T A FOCUS OF THE STRIKE TEAM. AND IT JUST BOGGLES OUR MINDS AT THIS POINT THAT. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ENOUGH ATTENTION ON THIS SO LET ME ASK A QUESTION. HAVE YOU CONVENE A MULTI AGENCY TASK FORCE ON THIS. YEAH YES I HAVE AND TELLS US. SO CHIEF MONTEREY OF OUR INVESTIGATION DIVISION LEAVES LEADS THE TASK FORCE AND HE WORKS WITH OUR I. T. HE WORKS WITH OUR INFORMATION SECURITY AS WELL AS A PROGRAMS ITSELF. HE AND A TASK WORK TASK- THE WORKGROUP HAVE BEEN A MEETING CLOSELY WITH DEPARTMENT OF LABOR OF THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS TO INSTITUTE ALL THE VARIOUS TOOLS THAT I'VE LIVED I'VE- REFERENCED IN THE HANDOUT I PROVIDED YOU. BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE MORE PEOPLE BUT THE END OF THE DAY- THE THIS KIND OF YOU KNOW TAKE FROM A TECHNOLOGY STANDPOINT. IS REALLY DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS- THAT REALLY HELP THE FORENSIC REVIEW AND DETECTION OF WHAT'S GOING ON I THINK IS WHAT THE LAST COUNT TO SAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET INTO. CASE BY CASE IS IT'S VERY VERY TIME CONSUMING AND RESOURCE INTENSIVE AND NOT NOT TYPICALLY THE BEST WAY TO- YOU KNOW DRESS THAT THE MASSES SO WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE MASSES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DEPARTMENT. I UNDERSTAND HAVE A LOT GOING ON- IT JUST STRIKES US THOUGH THAT IF YOU ONLY HAVE TWENTY SEVEN INDIVIDUALS OUT OF NINE THOUSAND WE'VE GIVEN YOU THE AUTHORITY THIS YEAR TO HIRE OVER FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. YOU WOULD THINK. THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A LARGER TEAM DEALING WITH THIS IN FACT THE ASSISTANT CHIEF FROM BEVERLY HILLS STRIKES ME AS SOMEONE WHO YOU SHOULD BRING IN RIGHT AWAY TO HELP THIS TEAM. BUT AT THE LEAST IT IS IT STRIKES ME AS BUREAUCRATICALLY CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT THAT UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP THERE'S NOTHING MORE DEVOTED TO THIS FRAUD IF POTENTIALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ARE BEING STOLEN FROM THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS WOULD YOU AGREE. THAT AT THIS POINT YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO FRAUD. I THINK WE CAN ALWAYS DO MORE. ABSOLUTELY I MEAN IT'S BEEN A- YOU KNOW AT THE BIG YEAH. DR FOR US FIRST PARTICULARLY THE LAST FEW MONTHS- WHEN WE SAW A RISING UP A FIGURE OUT VERYTHING THAT WE CAN DO. SO I THINK WE CONTINUE TO. PARTNER WITH EVERYBODY WE CONTINUE TO REACH OUT OF COULD WE DO MORE AND- ABSOLUTELY LIKE I SAID WE ARE CONTINUING TO HIRE IT'S JUST A SLOW PROCESS WHEN IT COMES TO POLICE OFFICERS OR PROFOUND PEACE OFFICERS. MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MISTER YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISS PETER NORRIS I WANT ONE FOLLOW UP PICKING UP ONLINE AS NEW HIRES I'D SAY MY COLLEAGUE. FROM LOS ANGELES HAD ASKED YOU ABOUT THE NUMBER OF NEW HIRES THAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY PLANNING ON AND I THINK DID YOU SAY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED NEW INDIVIDUALS PLAYED A HIGHER WE HAVE FORTY TWO HUNDRED THAT WE HIRED WE HAVE ANOTHER THOUSAND THAT ARE. JUST WAITING FOR THEIR START DATES OKAY AND HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE FRAUD INVESTIGATORS. NO THIS WAS FOR THE U. I. PROGRAM BUT WE HANDLE A LOT OF THE CASES ADMINISTRATIVELY- THAT FRAUD INVESTIGATORS ARE JUST THOSE FOR THOSE- REALLY FOR THE RINGS THE CRIMINAL RINGS.
