THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE LIKE MANY RESOURCE CONCERNS HAS A CRITICAL LOCAL COMPONENT. COMMUNITIES NEED TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE FUEL LOADS. MANAGE FORCE APPROPRIATELY CREATE FUEL BREAKS AND EDUCATE MEMBERS ON US SAFE EVACUATION ROUTES. THIS MUST HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL LANDOWNER TO LANDOWNER. THIS TAKES THE WORK OF LOCAL GROUPS LIKE THE RCTS LIKE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES AND THESE GROUPS HAVE LIMITED BUDGETS. WHEN I TALK TO OUR CITIES AND OTHER LOCAL GROUPS AROUND THE STATE AND ASK THEM WHAT'S THE ONE THING THAT WE COULD DO? TO MAKE THEIR JOBS EASIER. THE NUMBER ONE RESPONSE IS ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO TAKE AWAY THE BURDEN OF CASH FLOW. WITH THE ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS OUTLINED IN THIS BILL THE STATE CAN BE ASSURED THAT GOOD WORK WILL GET DONE. AND THAT LOCAL GROUPS WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE PARTICULARLY WHEN GOING THROUGH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS BILL AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER SUPPORTERS.

HOWEVER WE'VE ONLY LOOKED AT THE JUNE FOURTEENTH VERSION OF DON'T HAVE MUCH IN [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK IT'S OUT ON A ROLL CALL THINKING THIS MORNING. YOU HAVE ELEVEN NINETY TWO AS WELL YES AT ALSO ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER IS THE SECOND BY MISTER QUIRK IN THE PRESENT THANK YOU. I'LL BE BRIEF MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- CALIFORNIANS DIETARY HABITS HAVE CHANGED GREATLY IN THE LAST FEW DECADES. WITH MORE MORE OF OUR FOOD BUDGETS BEING SPENT ON FOOD PREPARED OUTSIDE THE HOME. MOST MEALS OFFERED AND MARKETED TO CHILDREN REST READ DRINK WHICH OFTEN CONTAINS MORE THAN THE WEEKLY AMOUNT OF SUGAR RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN. MANY RESTAURANTS AND FAST FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS HOWEVER HAVE ALREADY TAKEN STEPS CHANGE WHAT BEVERAGES THEY OFFER IN THEIR KIDS MEALS. RESTAURANTS LIKE MCDONALD'S JACK IN THE BOX APPLEBEE'S AND I HOP HAVE ALL VOLUNTARILY MADE EFFORTS TO OFFER MORE HEALTHFUL BEVERAGE OPTIONS FOR CHILDREN. SENATE BILL ELEVEN NINETY TWO FOLLOWS THE LEAD OF THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND IMPLEMENTS A STATEWIDE HELPFUL DEFAULT BEVERAGE POLICY IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH WILL REQUIRE A RESTAURANT THAT SERVES A MEAL PRIMARILY OFFERED FOR CONSUMPTION BY CHILDREN. TO MAKE THE DEFAULT DRINK OPTIONS SERVED IN THOSE BUNDLED MEALS A HEALTHFUL BEVERAGE SUCH AS WATER SPARKLING WATER FLAVORED WATER WITH NO ADDED SWEETENERS OR UNFLAVORED MILK. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CUSTOMERS CAN STILL. EXPLICITLY ASK TO REPLACE THE HELPFUL DRINK WITH A SUGARY BEVERAGE BUT THE DEFAULT BEVERAGE OFFERED IN A CHILDREN'S MEAL. MUST BE A HEALTHFUL OPTION. MEMBERS PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES LIKE THE ONE FOUND IN THIS BILL CAN HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT IN EDUCATING PARENTS ABOUT THE SEVERE CHRONIC HEALTH IMPACTS. SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES ON THEIR CHILDREN. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU [inaudible] WITNESS INSPIRED. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DOCTOR FLOWS ON CO FOR AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF STATE POLICY AND RESEARCH FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES. I AM PLEASED TO JOIN THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AMERICAN STROKE ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA STATE ALLIANCE OF YMCAS THE LATINO COALITION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA AND MOM'S RISING TO CO SPONSOR SB. ELEVEN NINETY TWO AS YOU'RE AWARE WE HAVE AN OBESITY EPIDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS DRIVEN BY THE CONSUMPTION OF SUGARY DRINKS SUGARY DRINKS OF THE LARGEST SOURCE OF ADDED SUGAR IN OUR DIETS. ANY THEY COME WITH HEALTH CONSEQUENCES A CHILD WHO CONSUMES JUST WANNA SUGARY DRINK A DAY INCREASES THE RISK OF BEING OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE BY 55%. THE RISK OF HAVING DIABETES BY HAVING CAVITIES SO THIS IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. AND SO EACH OF THE CO SPONSORS HERE TODAY REALLY FOCUS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR HEALTH AND WE SEE THIS AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL BILL A BILL THAT CHANGES THE RETAIL FOOD ENVIRONMENT BY CHANGING WHAT IS WHAT IS DONE BY DEFAULT. I OFTEN TELL THE STORY OF COOKIES THAT IF I BROUGHT COOKIES TO YOU THIS MORNING OR DONUTS SINCE WE'RE HERE IN THE MORNING MANY OF YOU WOULD HAVE A DONUT AND NONE OF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME FOR A DONUT OTHERWISE AND YOU'D HAVE A DONUT BECAUSE IT WAS. HERE AND THAT'S THE INFLUENCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND MANY OF US DO WHAT HAPPENS BY DEFAULT AND SO THIS BILL IS REALLY CHANGING THAT SO WE'RE MAKING THE HEALTHY CHOICE THE EASY CHOICE. BY NOT PRIMING CHILDREN TO CONSUME SUGARY DRINKS. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION THE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS ARE ARE NEGLIGIBLE -- TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND LARGE BUSINESSES AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THE STATE ARE QUITE SMALL BECAUSE THIS IS BEING PULLED IN FOLDED INTO EXISTING ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS. SO WE SEE THIS AS A BILL THAT IS SMART THAT RELIEVED TRULY PROTECTS PUBLIC HEALTH AND WE'VE ALSO TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR A SMALL BUSINESS IS THE FIRST VIOLATION IS ACTUALLY JUST A WARNING IT'S SORT OF A FIX THAT TICKET. BECAUSE THE GOAL HERE IS NOT TO PENALIZE BUSINESSES THE GOAL REALLY IS TO GET THEM TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS CHILDREN'S HEALTH. SMALL CHANGES TO THE ENVIRONMENT CAN MAKE A REALLY BIG IMPACT AND SO WE WANT TO HAVE MORE SECONDS I'M SO I GUESS WE ONE OF THE KIDS GROWING UP -- NOT SEEN THESE BEVERAGES AND BEING PRIME SO I I STRONGLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU AYE I'M HOPING AND LEAVE A LOT OF BILLS TODAY AND I DO APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO KEEP COMMENTS TO THE A SCHOOL ISSUE -- BECAUSE THIS IS. TECHNICALLY NOT POLICY COMMITTEE.

WE KNOW THAT BY CREATING AN INFRACTION PUNISHABLE BY INCREASING FINDS THIS BILL COULD IMPOSE NEW BUT LIKELY MINIMAL COSTS AND WORKLOAD ON COUNTIES WHICH CREATES ADDITIONAL FISCAL PRESSURES ON THE LOCAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY WE NOTE MINOR AN OBSERVABLE COST LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES TO ENFORCE THE NEW RETAIL COULD PROVISIONS. HOWEVER ANY NEW COSTA ENTITIES WOULD INCUR WOULD BE COVERED FOR PERMITTING FEES [inaudible] THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE ANY COMMENTS AS A PARENT -- I THINK YOU FOR THIS BILL.
