JACOB POOR ALSO WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU RIGHT WHEN WE GO HEAD BEGIN WITH THE SONOMA WHICH IS THE OVERVIEW THANK YOU THANK YOU -- SEPARATELY THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON SOME OF THE MAJOR SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES. IN IMPLEMENTING CDA PROGRAMS. BRIEF BACKGROUND CDA IS THE FEDERALLY DESIGNATED STATE UNIT ON AGING AND ADMINISTERS PROGRAMS SERVING OLDER ADULTS. ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES FAMILY CARE GIVERS AND RESIDENTS TO LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTERS FUNDING ALLOCATED UNDER THE FEDERAL OLDER AMERICANS ACT THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT AND THROUGH THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT CONTRACTS WITH THE NETWORK OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING KNOWN AS TRIPLE A.'S. THAT DIRECTLY MANAGE A WIDE ARRAY OF FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDED SERVICES TO HELP OLDER ADULTS FIND EMPLOYMENT. SUPPORT OLDER AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS TO LIVE AS INDEPENDENTLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE COMMUNITY. PROMOTE HEALTHY AGING AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND ASSIST FAMILY CARE GIVERS IN THEIR VITAL KERR GIVING ROLE. CITY ALSO CONTRACTS WITH THIRTY EIGHT LOCAL AGENCIES THAT OPERATE THE MULTI PURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM. THROUGH THE MEDI CAL HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED WAIVER FOR THE ELDERLY. AND CITY ALSO CERTIFIES COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES PROVIDERS FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE AND THANK THE TRIPLE A NETWORK AND THE MANY LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP IN ADMINISTERING THESE PROGRAMS THESE ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE THE ON THE GROUND DIRECT SERVICES TO OUR PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. WE COULD NOT DO THIS IMPORTANT WORK WITHOUT THEM. SO AS REQUESTED BY THE COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS RECENT SUCCESSES. IN MAY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CITY RECEIVED AN INCREASE OF SEVENTEEN MILLION AND FEDERAL TITLE THREE GRANT FUNDING. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON COMMUNITY LIVING. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT AGREEMENT AND RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING. DISTRIBUTED TO TRIPLE A.'S TO SUPPORT CONGREGATE NUTRITION HOME DELIVERED MEALS SUPPORTIVE SERVICES HEALTH PROMOTION CARE GIVER SUPPORT. LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN AND THEN YOU TO PROGRAM. CDS OFFICE OF THE STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN WORKED WITH THE NATIONAL CONSUMER VOICE FOR QUALITY LONG TERM CARE TO APPLY FOR A TWO YEAR EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR FEDERAL GRANT. THIS FUNDING WOULD PROVIDE TRAINING TO NURSING HOME STAFF AN OMBUDSMAN REPRESENTATIVES ON PERSON CENTERED CARE AND STRATEGIES TO AVOID THE INAPPROPRIATE DISCHARGE OF NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. THE APPLICATIONS PENDING WITH CMS AND WE HOPE TO HEAR BACK SOON. IN COLLABORATION WITH CALIFORNIA REGIONAL ALZHEIMER'S ORGANIZATIONS CITY A HAS APPLIED FOR A THREE YEAR SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FEDERAL DEMONSTRATION GRANT. THIS FUNDING WOULD BE USED TO REPLICATE AND EXPAND TO MENTION TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP PLAN CARE MANAGERS SO THEY CAN BETTER IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH DEMENTIA AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES CDA HAS EXPANDED CALPERS OUT REACH TO OLDER ADULTS VIA FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EDUCATION FUNDING ON A FLAT BED. WITH THE GOAL OF HELPING OLDER ADULTS MAKE HEALTHIER FOOD CHOICES. AND TO INCREASE THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PARTICIPATING TRIPLE A.'S AND THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS SERVED OVER FIVE THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS. IN ADDITION APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED NUTRITION EDUCATION THROUGH PUBLISHED MATERIALS AND WEBSITE MESSAGING AT SITES WERE SNAP AT ACTIVITIES ARE DELIVERED. UNDER THE NEW COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES PROGRAM THERE ARE NOW 200-51 C. BASS PROVIDERS AND OVER THIRTY SIX THOUSAND SEA BASS PARTICIPANTS. THESE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO GROW SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THIRTEEN YOU SEE BASS PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED. AS OF JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CDA HAS RESPONDED TO ALMOST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING. OPENING NEW SEA BASS CENTERS. IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CDA DESIGNATD AN ADDITIONAL AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTION. TO SIR PLASTER COUNTY EXPANDING SERVICES IN THAT AREA THERE ARE NOW EIGHT DESIGNATED. EIGHTY OUR SEASON THE STATE. CDA CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND OUR TRIPLE A PARTNERS TO IMPLEMENT THE REVERSAL AT THE SS I CASH OUT POLICY. THESE EFFORTS WILL ASSIST NEWLY ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS AGE SIXTY PLUS WITH APPLYING FOR CALPERS BENEFITS THEY'RE BY SUPPORTING IMPROVED NUTRITION FOR OLDER ADULTS. IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CITY IS OFFICE OF THESTATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN RELEASED A NEW CURRICULUM CHAPTER.

WE WILL ALSO BE UPDATING THE HEALTH INSURANCE COUNSELING AN ADVOCACY PROGRAM CANCER HANDBOOK TO INCLUDE THE MOST RECENT MEDICARE INFORMATION. THESE ARE IMPORTANT RESOURCES FOR CONSUMER EDUCATION. LAST ACCOMPLISHED MAN I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS AN ON GOING ONE CDA CONTINUES TO PARTNER WITH THE LOCAL TRIPLE A.'S AND THEIR ASSOCIATION ON VARIOUS INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS VIA WORKGROUPS MEETINGS AND ENHANCE COMMUNICATION EFFORTS. THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR US AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE OUR COLLABORATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO SUPPORT THE TRIPLE A IS AN IMPORTANT WORK. MOVING ON TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES -- FIRST LIMITED DATA TO INFORM PROGRAM DELIVERY AND TO DETERMINE NEEDS AND GAPS IN SERVICES. THIS IS A BROADER ISSUE AFFECTING MANY AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO OLDER ADULTS. AND ADDRESSING IT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT OMPONENT OF A COORDINATED PLAN FOR AGING SERVICES -- ANOTHER CHALLENGES IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR PROGRAMS THIS CONTRIBUTES TO WORKLOAD CHALLENGES FOR BOTH THE STATE AND OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE FIND INNOVATIVE AND STREAMLINE METHODS TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE SO WE CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY DELIVER OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS. THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON A FISSION SERVICE DELIVERY RATHER THAN BURDENSOME ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES. RECRUITING AND RETAINING VOLUNTEER WORKERS AND CITIES STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SPECIAL SKILLS NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO CONFRONT. ABUSE NEGLECT AND EXPLOITATION. WE LOOK TO CONTINUE TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND ENSURING ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF VOLUNTEERS. THE LAST CHALLENGE IS TO REPORT IDENTIFYING. A MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO UTILIZE THE INFORMATION WE GET FROM CDS MONITORING OF TRIPLE A.'S WE NEED TO USE THIS INFORMATION AS WELL AS FEEDBACK FROM THE TRIP LAYS TO DEVELOP BETTER TRAINING. MORE HELPFUL TOOLS AND RESOURCES THIS SUPPORT OUR PARTNERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. PROGRAM MONITORING IS REQUIRED ACTIVITY AND IS CURRENTLY VERY TIME CONSUMING FOR BOTH STATE AND LOCAL STAFF WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE IT MORE STREAMLINED TO REDUCE WORKLOAD TIME. AND COST WE VIEW THESE CHALLENGES AS OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS IN A THOUGHTFUL AND INNOVATIVE MANNER. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS. FOR RIGHT NOW FOR IMMEDIATE FOCUS IS TO FILL CRITICAL. TO POSITIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR INTERNAL OPERATIONS. AND MAXIMIZE OUR EXISTING RESOURCES WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR VITAL NETWORK OF TRIPLE A.'S LOCAL PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HOW CURRENT PROGRAMS ARE ADMINISTERED AND TO BETTER MEET BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE WE SERVE.

OKAY WELL -- SO ACTUALLY AT THE THAT'S BECAUSE IN TERMS OF SO WE WE HAVE THREE PROPOSALS BY A IN TERMS OF AN SS HE OF THE TESTIMONY WAS IS THAT -- THAT FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT UP TO I GUESS IS FROM A WAIVER SO THERE'S A CAP ON THE TOTAL NUMBER BUT WE'RE NOT UP TO MAXIMUM CAP -- BUT ALSO THAT IT AVOIDS. INSTITUTIONALIZATION -- SO -- AND FROM -- FIVE AGING ARE LA YELLOWS THERE AS IS RUN SOME EVALUATION AS TO WHAT -- WHAT DEGREE THEY SP PROGRAM THAT DOES -- REDUCE -- BASICALLY INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PEOPLE HAVING TO AND TO MOVE TO NURSING HOMES WHICH BY THE WAY WE ALSO PAYS A STATE THE EVEN MORE SO CAN YOU JUST CAN YOU DRESSED AS ONE LOOKED AT THAT ISSUE. WE DO KNOW -- THAT AT LONG CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING WE DO KNOW THAT EMESIS P.. DOES PREVENT OR DELAY INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PERSONS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD BE -- QUALIFIED TO BE IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE -- I DIDN'T COME PREPARED WITH HER THE THE THE FAX WE'D -- THE INFORMATION WE DO HAVE. BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY PULL THAT TOGETHER THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AND GET THAT TO THE COMMITTEE -- AND LA LA -- HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT ISSUE AT ALL. SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE YEAR ROUND. WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY PARTICULAR CITY BUT HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN AND ALSO I'M THE EMESIS BESIDE ASSOCIATION TO SEE IF FUND THEY HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THAT BUT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THE DEPARTMENT MADE IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT RECEIVE EMESIS P. -- ESSENTIALLY ARE ELIGIBLE AND IT -- AND OUR FRIEL ENOUGH TO BE IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY SO I'M. HAPPY TO SEE WHATEVER INFORMATION WE COULD GET TO GET -- HOPE YOU ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND THEN I GUESS FOR FINANCE -- TO ME WE HAVE THE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE -- WA TO SAVE MONEY. SO ANY THOUGHTS FROM FINANCE ABOUT LOOKING AT THIS DATA IN TERMS OF I KNOW WHEN YOU. FINALLY CRUNCH EVERYTHING FROM A REVISED. I MEAN WE WE CAN WORK WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS IN FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE DEPARTMENT BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING -- CATCHER NIGHT DAY I RECOGNIZE THAT -- SO BUT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LOOK AT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT WAS A SAID THAT. AS I UNDERSTANDTHAT -- WE EAT UP THERE'S BOTH A RATE INCREASE ARE ASKING FOR BU ALSO EVEN IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF POSITIONS IN THE WAIVER I RECOGNIZE THERE'S A CAP BUT IF IT. PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM GOING TO NURSING HOME CARE WE CAN THAT NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT THE MONEY BUT IF YOU DO AN ACTUARY ANALYSIS AND METER THAT SAVES US MONEY TO DO THAT. SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN DO THOSE KIND OF CALCULATIONS. THAT'S SOMETHING THINK FINANCE CAN LOOK AT WE WE CAN'T DO AN ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS ARE OUR STAFF HOLDS BUT WELL TO THE SIDE I'M HOPING THAT HAPPY. TO LOOK AT THE DAY OKAY -- YES THAT -- THE DEPARTMENT HAS OKAY. WILL DEFINITELY PROVIDE TECHNICAL SYSTEM OKAY WELL I I THINK I THINK THE IDEA IS THE OF THAT -- BROUGHT UP IN MULTIPLE HEARINGS BEFORE EIGHT WE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE ITEMS WE THINK OKAY V. PUT MONEY INTO SOMETHING WE ALWAYS SCORE ACOSTA THAT RIGHT. BUT WE SHOULD ALSO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS WE DON'T DO IT WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT SO -- I DON'T THINK THE SENIORS WHO WOULD TAKE UP THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. ARE GOING TO BE NOT. DOWN THE AND NOT GOING TO TO DELTA THE THING IS IS THAT IF WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW IN NURSING HOMES ARE TO COULD HAVE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE NURSING HOME SUIT DOWN. TO MY GUESS IS A SOMEONE RAN THE NUMBERS THAT FIGHT CHEAPER TO HAVE THEM S. S. P. THAT AND HAVING A NURSING HOME CARE SO. ASIDE FROM THE QUALITY ISSUES AND SO FORTH YOU KNOW I MEAN EVEN JUST A NUMBERS STANDPOINT -- AND AND MAYBE I REALIZE THE FEDS PAY HALF FOR NURSING HOME UNDER MEDI CAL ABOUT THE EVEN IF EVEN AT THAT RATE. SO I JUST I JUST HOPE YOU LOOK AT THAT SO WHEN WE COST EFFECTIVE AS IT CROSSES IN EVERYTHING WE ALSO LOOK AT OTHER FACTORS BUT EVEN FROM A COST STANDPOINT NOW WE SHOULD HOPEFULLY. HOPEFULLY CAN WORK TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GO THERE [inaudible] YES -- SOME OF THE INFORMATION WE DO HAVE LIMóN WE RENEWS THE WAIVER FOR MSN WE HAVE TO TO REPORTING TO THE FEDS RIGHT. IS THE COST OF EMESIS P. TO WHAT THE COST OF OF A HIGHER LEVEL OF KERR WOULD BE SO WE NEED TO HAVE THAT SORT OF NATION. PULL TOGETHER AND WE COULD WORK WITH FINANCE TO SHARE THEM WITH YOU ALL RIGHT I FIGURED BETWEEN NOW AND MAY WE CAN PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER FORGET SOUTH. ALL RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL -- I THINK WITH THAT -- THAT -- WE'RE GOING TO HOLD OPEN -- THOSE ITEMS -- ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH THE B. C. P. ON CBS -- AND THEN ALSO ISSUE NUMBER THREE EACH. SO I WANT THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH -- FOR PRESENTATION THE BARDEN AGING AND SO WHAT WE CAN DO NOW IS GOING -- TO MOVE ON TO OUR BACK TO THE FIRST ITEM WHICH IS THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE ALL THE SPEAKERS HERE NOW.

APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND SHARING WITH US YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT ARE SOME THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AND ADD THINGS TO BE LOOKED AT IN A MASTER PLAN ON AGING SO. AGAIN BEGIN WITH THOUGHT THIS BROSSIER FAMILIAL THANK YOU WELCOME. OUR OFFICE WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE JUST A STATUS UPDATE IN TERMS OF WHERE THE STATE IS AT WHEN IT COMES TO PLANNING FOR THE AGING POPULATION AND ON THIS QUESTION IS DEFINITELY COME UP -- AND SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR OFFICE. THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE JUST TO GET A BETTER CENTER STARTING POINT ON THIS CONVERSATION AS YOU MENTIONED WE DID DO -- SOME WORK ON LOOKING AT DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS SPECIFIC TO THE AGING POPULATION BUT THEN ALSO PROJECTING OUT DISABILITY RATES -- WHICH THEN ARE SET THE TONE OF DOUBLE BY TWENTY SIXTY BUT THEN ALSO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A HIGHER SHARE OF THE AGING POPULATION -- WITH DISABILITIES -- AS MEASURED BY JUST LIMITATIONS WITH ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING WHICH IS AN INDICATOR OF A NEED FOR THAN THESE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND THAT THE STATE. OPERATES I'M SORRY THESE BIG PICTURE QUESTIONS -- JUST TO TAKE A STEP BACK THINGS THAT HAPPENED RESEARCH OVER THE RECENT YEARS THAT HAVE MADE SOME MOVEMENT IN TERMS OF THIS. BLOCK LARGE BIG PICTURE PLANNING FOR THE AGING POPULATION IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AS A PART OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET TO PROVIDE -- SOME FUNDING TO INCLUDE QUESTIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY AND THESE QUESTIONS IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD HELP THE STATE GATHER MORE INFORMATION NOT ONLY ON THE PREVALENCE OF DISABILITIES. BUT ALSO COGNITIVE AND FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENTS NEED AND USE OF L. T. S. AS CURRENTLY. ARE THERE -- LEVELS OF UNMET NEEDS. AND ALSO FACTORS THAT CAN MITIGATE OR OFFSET ON THE NEED FOR L. TSS. OF THESE QUESTIONS -- THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY AND IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT -- THEY WILL BE ANALYZED -- BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY BUT AGAIN IT'S IT'S MORE OF THAT LIKE LONG TERM NEAR TERM PLANNING OF A JUST GATHERING DATA WHICH IS KEY -- ADDITIONALLY THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED -- HAS BEEN. AS YOU MENTIONED THE NOVEMBER HEARING IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE CONVENED A PANEL NOT ONLY TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS BUT THENALSO THEN. A SENSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT ON OF THE PROGRAM ONLY WATER WHAT ARE THE EFFORTS AND FUTURE PLANNING. WITH THAT. IN THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NOT ALL OF NOT ONLY AS THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO EXPRESS INTEREST BUT THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THIS CONCEPT OF DEVELOPING A MASTER PLAN. AND ALTHOUGH THE DETAILS -- ARE FORTHCOMING -- THIS DEFINITELY IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO NOT ONLY DEFINE THE SCOPE OF THE MASTER PLAN BUT ALSO TO COME UP WITH A TIME LINE AND THESE KEY QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE USED TO INFORM THE MASTER PLAN. IN OUR NOVEMBER HEARING WE JUST PRESENTED A SAMPLE OF SOME OF THOSE POTENTIAL QUESTIONS THAT COULD BE -- USED ON AS A POINT OF CONSIDERATION. SOME OF THOSE INCLUDE. I'M GETTING A BETTER SENSE OF THE CURRENT L. TSS SYSTEM AND THEN ALSO HOW IS THAT MEETING THE CURRENT NEEDS OF SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES -- PROJECTING OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE DO EXPECT IN THE FUTURE WILL BE NEEDING SOME FORM OF L. TSS SERVICES -- WHAT TYPES OF SERVICES WHAT THEY NEED? AND THEN ALSO THINKING WE HAVE OUR CURRENT BUCKET OF LTE SAYS PROGRAMS BUT THEN THAT IN THIS CONCEPT OF FUTURE PLANNING DOES THAT THE NECESSITATE THE CONVERSATION UP ARE THERE ADDITIONAL TSS PROGRAMS THAT WE THAT MAY NEED TO BE INTRODUCED INTO THE MIX -- LASTLY THINGS THAT WE ALSO MENTIONED IS HOW WILL THE FUTURE ALTI ASSIST UTILIZATION AND PACKED THE FINANCING OF THE STATE FUNDED LTO SUCH PROGRAMS AS WELL. THOSE ARE FEW QUESTIONS THAT WE LAID OUT AND I KNOW THE PANELISTS WILL SPEAK MORE BROADLY IN TOUCH ON OTHER DIMENSIONS OF THIS CONCEPT OF A MASTER PLAN. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT DR WEBER [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD MORNING -- IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC -- I WORK WITH GERONTOLOGIST AND DEMOGRAPHER'S AND A LONGEVITY EXPERTS AND WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS STRIDES AS YOU KNOW AND WE'RE ALL HAPPY ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE AN AGING SOCIETY LIVING INTO OUR EIGHTIES AND NINETIES. BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE I DON'T THINK WE DO THE BEST JOB WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. OLDER AGES OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND THAT IT'S A SECURE OLD AGE. IN PREPARING FOR THIS I KIND OF LOOK BACK AND I HAVE TO SAY I'VE BEEN COMING UP HERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME I'VE WORKED ON FIVE MAJOR PROJECTS WITH THE STATE. STARTING IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND AS I LOOKED IT WAS EVERY ABOUT EVERY DECADE AND THEN IT'S TIGHTENED UP WITH SOME OF THE PROJECTS WE'VE DONE ONE WAS -- CALLED THE LONG TERM CARE INTEGRATION. WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO INTEGRATE MEDICARE AD MEDICAID AND LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS DATA? ACROSS TWENTY COUNTIES AND ANSWER SOME VERY INTERESTING QUESTIONS BEFORE THAT WAS SHUT DOWN WE ALSO WORKED ON A PROJECT. TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A DATA WAREHOUSE -- BECAUSE OF HIGH. I WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT KIND OF WHAT WE KNOWN WHAT DATA ARE AVAILABLE AND THE THE PROBLEM IS THAT I DON'T THINK WE KNOW NEARLY ENOUGH BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA -- MOST RECENTLY WE WORKED AND MOST OF THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN BETWEEN UCLA AND USC SO WE'RE ABLE TO COORDINATE ACROSS THOSE ENTITIES -- BUT THE MOST RECENT ONE WAS LOOKING AT A UNIVERSAL ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT AND LOTS OF STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WITH THAT PROJECT. A AND I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF INFORMATION THAT'S STILL OUT THERE FOR ALL THESE PROJECTS. TO BUILD ON AND THE SORT OF THINKING ABOUT THE KEY TAKEAWAYS SOME OF WHICH YOU'VE HEARD. REPEATEDLY ABOUT THE FACT THAT WERE AN AGING SOCIETY PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE ONE AGENT PLACE. AND TO DO THAT THEY NEED HOUSING AND THEY NEED SERVICES AND THEY NEED SUPPORTS COMING INTO THEIR HOMES -- THERE ARE A VARIETY OF INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE PULLED IN -- FROM CO HOUSING TO THE CAPABLE PROGRAM WHICH BRINGS HANDYMAN INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES TO INTENTIONAL COMMUNITIES -- I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD THIS OVER AND OVER AND CARE GIVERS FAMILY CARE GIVERS ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE CURRENT LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. BETWEEN FIFTY SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT BILLION BILLION DOLLARS WHICH ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS ABOUT DOUBLE CALIFORNIA'S MEDI CAL. CONTRIBUTION SO THAT'S HUGE BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER FROM PEOPLE. MAKING PUBLIC COMMENT WE'VE SEEN SERVICES KAT. AND TERMINATED SO THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS COME BEEN CUT BACK DRAMATICALLY. AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED IT AND I HAVE TO SAY HAVE BEEN COMING UP HERE TO TESTIFY FOR THESE THIRTY YEARS SAYING. WE'RE GOING TO BE AN AGING SOCIETY WE NEED TO GET READY. LOOKS LIKE I DIDN'T DO THAT COMPELLING A JOB BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET READY AND NOW -- NOW WE EED -- TO WE STILL HAVE SILO DATA I THINK THE CHEST QUESTIONS WILL BE REALLY HELPFUL -- BUT WE REALLY NEED DATA TO HELP US. ANSWER SOME OF THE CORE QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF SERVICE PATTERNS AND DUPLICATION -- WHAT WHAT DOES CREATE RISK FOR NURSING FACILITY PLACEMENT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT WITH MONEY FOLLOWS THE PERSON? WHO'S ACTUALLY ABLE TO COME OUT AND WE KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FACILITIES THAT HAVE KIND OF RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY TO GO BACK TO THE COMMUNITY DON'T. EXIT THE FACILITY BECAUSE THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THEM IN THE COMMUNITY SO THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT -- SO I I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE A FEW MORE COMMENTS ACROSS THESE FIVE STUDIES IN THESE THIRTY YEARS. SO FIRST CALIFORNIA HAS SOME VERY INNOVATIVE AND REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AND YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THEM AND THE AMASIS P. I. TO SAYS -- BUT WHAT WE'VE LACKED IS A COHERENT VISION. OF FOR PEOPLE TO AGING PLACE TO HAVE OF PERSON CENTERED CARE. BECAUSE WE FLEXIBLE POLITICAL WILL AND SO I THINK NOW WE'RE AT THE JUNCTURE WHERE THE AGING POPULATION IS HERE. AND IT'S REALLY TIME TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THE MASTER PLAN TO PUT THE RIGHT PEOPLE. ON THE TASK AND SEE IF CALIFORNIA CAN -- GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'LL JONES JONES WELCOME. THERE IS A DOT THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME THIS MORNING THEY GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF SENIORS ALL OVER AND SHARE WITH YOU MY PERSONAL JOURNEY. I'M A PERSON IN THE EAST COAST TO NEW JERSEY I MOVED HERE. JUST PRIOR TO RETIRING IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE SO THAT POINT I DIDN'T KNOW. ANY RESOURCES HOW TO GO ABOUT TO WIN MEDICARE OR WHAT BENEFITS I HAD. SO -- I WAS BLESSED. THAT REPORTED THE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON AGING IN CONTRA COSTA. THAT GROUP IN TRIPLE A A VERY VITAL. TO SENIORS UNDERSTANDING. HOWEVER AT THAT POINT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION ASSISTANCE. CALL CENTER AND I DON'T KNOW THE DATA ON OTHER COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA MAYBE YOU DO THAT HAVE THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW. WHERE TO GO TO GET AN ANSWER AND THEN GO FORTH BECAUSE YOU'RE FAMILIES GENERALLY DON'T KNOW NEIGHBORS OR CHURCH MEMBERS? SOUL I WAS BLESSED TO MEET THEM AND I GOT -- TO AFFILIATE WITH SOME THE ARM [inaudible] TO BANK. AND THE MANAGED CARE COMMISSION AT CONTRA COSTA HEALTH PLAN. WHICH GAVE ME A LITTLE UP ON SPECIALLY COMING FROM OUT OF STATE BECAUSE I HAD NO. CONNECTIONS AND MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WAS VERY VITAL. I PICKED ONE THAT WAS ON OUT OF THE PHONE BOOK. THAT WAS. A VERY VERY HELPFUL IN IN MY HEALTH CARE IN THE QUALITY OF ON THAT I GET IS A SENIOR. OKAY MY MY PRIORITIES AS A SENIOR. IN THINGS THAT THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD ON HELP MAKE HAPPEN NUMBER ONE IS HOUSING. AND THIS YEAR HOUSING CONCEPT IS VERY GOOD THAT THE WHOLE HOUSING OR HAVING SOMEONE IN FOR PEOPLE LIKE WHO HAVE A ONE IS THE IN HOME. AND THEY HAVE EXTRA ROOM THERE'S A PROJECT GOING ON I THINK IN ON CONCORD A GROUP THAT I THINK SOMEONE'S HERE FROM THERE DID ON THE INTERVIEW PEOPLE TO COME IN. AND LIVE WITH. ENGLISH HERE THE COURSE THAT'S A VERY GOOD CONCEPT. BUT THE MAIN THING I EXPERIENCE WAS. HOW DO I KNOW WHAT FACILITY TAKES IN SENIORS WHAT AGE THAT THE FIFTY FIVE YOU GET THE SIXTY TWO AND THEN YOU AFFORDABILITY? OF COURSE IT'S THE NUMBER. ONE HUD HAS -- DIFFERENT LEVELS OF HOUSING THAT THEY HELP PEOPLE WITH. SO WHAT I DID I WILL TO SIGN IN SACRAMENTO. I'M IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THEY SENT ME A LIST INDICATING. IT'S THE TO RUN ACROSS THAT NEEDS THAT HUD HAS A LISTING OF OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN. AND THAT THEREFORE YOU CAN HELP PEOPLE WITH THAT. FOOD THE FOOD BANK THIS SENIOR GIVE OUT THE CHURCH IS DIFFERENT THE SENIOR SENATORS. A GREAT RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED. MONEY FOR OUR FOOD. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE ON SSI I'M RETIRED SO SECURITY WHICH IS A LITTLE BETTER. BUT ON THE THEIR GREAT SOURCE FOR HELPING PEOPLE OUT AS WE SEE NOWADAYS HOWEVER ONCE. THE COST OF THINGS HERE FROM WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE IN TWO THOUSAND TILL NOW IS. IS ASTRONOMICAL SO I KNOW WE'RE ALL IN TROUBLE HEALTHCARE IS THE NEXT THING. OKAY PART D. TELL ME MY DAUGHTER MY MY DOCTOR ORDERED A PRESCRIPTION FOR ME. AND WALGREENS ON FILLED IT. AND THEN THEY TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE I WAS OVER SEVENTY YEARS OLD. THAT THEY HAD TO HAVE THE DOCTOR OR TO RISE TO PRESCRIPTION. THAT WAS TOTALLY NEW I DON'T I'M JUST THROWING IT OUT ON IT BUT I'M GONNA FIND OUT MAYBE YOU KNOW THE ANSWER DR PAT. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT IS ACTUALLY IN THE FORMULA WE BOOK IF YOU WILL WAS. SEVENTY THE DOCTOR HAS TO LOOK IF I WAS UNDER SEVENTY DAY WHEN A QUESTION ABOUT SCRIPTED AND THEY DON'T WANT TO FILL IT. I GOT IT BUT YOU KNOW I I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT. OKAY TRANSPORTATION IS ANOTHER THING IS THAT THAT'S HOW DO WE GET TO WHERE WE DON'T HOW DO YOU MOVE AROUND. AND THE LAST THING I AM CONCERNED WITH HIS ADULT DAYCARE THERE'S A LOT OF LEVELS OF AG. DECIDE TO TAKE YOUR BABY TO THE NURSERY. YOU CAN TAKE YOUR MOTHER YOUR GRANDMA. AND WHY YOU GO TO WORK. THEY'LL BE ON GIVEN YOUR MEDICINE FED AND ENTERTAINED SOCIALLY IT'S GOOD FOR THEM TO GET OUT. AND HANG OUT WITH OTHER SENIORS. IT'S LIKE YOU GUYS HANG OUT AT THE WELL. FOR THE WAY -- I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING OF A FACILITY IN PLEASANT HILL THEY DO A TREMENDOUS JOB. DATE -- BUT THEY HAVE SOME LOW INCOME SLOT WITHIN YEARS SO I THINK THE COMMITTEE SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THAT IN THE BUDGET WHEN YOU TALK -- TO OUR GOVERNOR IN AMONG YOURSELVES. TO MAKE AVAILABLE. ADULT DAYCARE CENTERS FOR PEOPLE IN IN SCREEN OUT PEOPLE THAT WOULD HELP THE FAMILY HAVE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE EVERYBODY'S HAPPY. FOR THE CARE TAKING CAN TAKE A NAP FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND AND YOU KNOW TAKE IT ON THAT LEVEL TO GO TO A DAYCARE CENTER. BY THE DAY SITTING HOME WATCHING FOUR WALLS AND A TV. OKAY SO -- I APPRECIATE YOU I THANK YOU FOR THE AS A SIDE BENEFIT TO TO PUT IN THAT WE LOBBY FOR LAST YEAR I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT. CELL THANK YOU AGAIN AND KEEP ON DOING AND ALWAYS SUPPORT ALL THESE PROGRAMS AS WELL YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. THIS CAMP WELCOME. THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE IT'S REALLY A PLEASURE [inaudible] AND I'VE BEEN ASKED TO KIND OF TALK ABOUT. PEOPLE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND AND DOCUMENTING NEEDS AND AND IT'S SUCH A BROAD CATEGORY THAT I DON'T THINK. I CAN DO ANY OF THAT JUSTICE IN THE TIME WE HAVE HERE -- AS ARE THE SOLUTIONS THEY'RE EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND TAKE A DETAILED LINK THE I TACK ON THE THE VERY DIFFERENT PROBLEMS WE FACE BUT A COUPLE THINGS THAT I WANT TO SHARE ABOUT. DOCUMENTING THE I JUST THINK THAT SHEER NUMBERS OF OUR POPULATION DOES THAT. RIGHT NOW THE SIXTY PLUS POPULATION IS AT EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION IN THE STATE. TEN OF THOSE. ONE OUT OF SIX LIVE ALONE. AND LONELINESS AND ISOLATION IS A TOPIC THAT WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING A LOT ABOUT IN THE-COMING YEARS. IT'S KIND OF BEEN IGNORED WE KIND OF HAVE BEEN TRYING TO MAINTAIN. THE CORE SERVICES THAT WE HALF BUT IT'S BEEN STUDY THAT LIVING ALONE -- BEING ISOLATED IS THE EQUIVALENT OF SPOKE SMOKING HALF A PACK A DAY OF CIGARETTES ON ON YOUR HEALTH CARE. SO THE PROGRAMS THAT WE DESIGN IN THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. NEED TO COMBAT THAT IN MANY OF THEM OFTEN IT'S ONE OF THE PUT THAT PIECE INTO THE MAX. ONE OUT OF EVERY. FIVE OTHERS SIXTY PLUS POPULATION IS MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE. SO I THINK THAT'LL LOAN DOCUMENTS THE NEED. JUST POVERTY WE ALL KNOW THE CAUSES AND CHALLENGES AND RESULTS OF POVERTY AND IF WE HAVE ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE SENIORS LIVING IN POVERTY WE HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS. IF YOU ASK ME THREE YEARS AGO ABOUT WHAT I WOULD THINK WE WOULD NEED. I WOULD HAVE BEEN SAYING TWO THINGS WE NEED TO ELEVATE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE OLDER ADULT POPULATION. CHAMPIONS. AND I'M REALLY THRILLED THAT WE KIND OF DONE THAT YOU KNOW I'M LOOKING AT LEGISLATIVE CHAMPIONS RIGHT NOW. AND THE WHOLE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MASTER PLAN AN AGING SHOWS WITH ELEVATED THAT CONVERSATION. SO THE CHALLENGE NOW BECOMES WELL NOW THAT IT'S HAPPENED WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT. HOW TO REMOVE THIS YOU'VE ISSUE FORWARD -- THERE'S A COUPLE KEY THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. ON THE BAD NEWS YOU HEARD ONE OF OUR PRESENTERS EARLIER. STATE THAT THE STATE GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION TO OUR CORE OLDER ADULT PROGRAMS HAS DROPPED BY THIRTY MILLION. OVER THE LAST DECADE IN TWO SIXTY TWO SIXTY THREE MILLION. AND THAT DROPPED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THIRTY TWO MILLION. AND THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE'S BEEN A CONCERTED EFFORT TO GET SOME OF THAT MONEY BACK AND WE GOT TWO TO THREE MILLION BACK WHICH IS. YOU KNOW HER RAY WERE REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THAT BUT CLEARLY WE HAVE THIRTY MILLION TO MAKE UP JUST TO GET WHERE WE WERE EN YEARS AGO. AND THAT WAS WITH A MUCH SMALLER POPULATION. AND NOT NECESSARILY ONE THAT WAS ACT AS ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED AS TODAY. SO I THINK THAT'S THE CHANNELS THAT I WOULD THROUGHOUT THEIR THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT WORK. WE JUST NEED TO INVEST IN THEM. WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO RECREATE THE WHEEL WE NEED TO RE CREATE HOW THE INTERFACE WITH EACH OTHER. AND THAT'S WHY THINGS LIKE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT IS BEING LOOKED AT TO DEVELOP A CALIFORNIA A COMMUNITY LIVING HOT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE REALLY COMBINING SERVICES AND MAKING SURE THAT WHAT'S NEEDED IS GETTING TO PEOPLE IN THE MOST COST EFFICIENT WAY. BUT THAT COMMITMENTS. TO WHAT ALREADY WORKS TO WHAT WE KNOW WORKS. IT'S CRITICAL NOW COURTS WE NEED TO INNOVATE WE NEED NEW PROGRAMS THAT'S ALWAYS PART OF WHATEVER CHALLENGES. BUT WE WHEN WE HAVE EXISTING SERVICES THAT WORK WELL. AND WE JUST DECIDED NOT TO FIND THEM WE DON'T HAVE A CRISIS IN POLICY WE HAVE A CRISIS IN FUNDING. AND WE DON'T JUST NEED AN MASTER PLAN ON AGING WEEDING UP MASTER PLAN ON PAYING FOR AGING. AND JUST TO WRAP UP I I KNOW MY TIMES JUST TO BRING THAT PIECE TOGETHER. WE ALSO KNOW THAT HEALTH CARE COSTS IN THE LAST 20% OF YOUR LIFE CONSTITUTE ABOUT 80% OF ALL OUR HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES. SO IF WE DO NOTHING WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE A BUDGET CRISIS DEALING WITH OLDER ADULTS WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING ALL THESE DOLLARS. TO DEAL WITH EMERGING HEALTH CARE. AND THAT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE INTERVENTION WE CAN TAKE. YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT EASIER TO PUT A GRAB BAR AND A BATHROOM. THE END IS TO REPLACE A HIP WHEN SOMEBODY'S FALLEN AND BROKEN THAT. SO. I BELIEVE OUR CHALLENGE AND WHAT THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING SHOULD FOCUS ON IS NOT HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO SPEND BECAUSE THAT'S A GIVEN. THE MASS SAYS WE'RE GOING TO SPEND A LOT. BUT LET'S LOOK AT HOW WE CAN SPEND THOSE DOLLARS EFFECTIVELY. COMPASSIONATELY AND IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY REDUCES THE EXPENDITURES THAT THE STATE HAS. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THE EXPENDITURES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN BUT TO SPEND THE DOLLARS RIGHT AND MAKE EVERYBODY'S LIFE PATTERN MAKER BUDGET LOOK BETTER. AND WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY NOW THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT MISTER MITCH THE PRESS SECRETARY YEAH YOU DATA CENTER PAN CENTER TANTO IN CENTER STONE THANKS FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE. BEFORE I BEGIN I JUST WANNA KNOWLEDGE THAT OTHER FOLKS ON THE PANEL I THINK IT'S REALLY GREAT TO HEAR THEIR PERSPECTIVES IDEAS AND RECOMMENDATIONS -- AND SPECIFICALLY TO MRS MRS JONES I THINK WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER AND WE MUST DO MUCH BETTER FOR INDIVIDUALS LIKE YOU AND THOSE THAT ARE SITTING IN HE AUDIENCE. AND SO THAT'S I THINK OUR TASK MOVING FORWARD -- AS YOU NOTED MY NAME IS MARKHAM EACH I'M THE ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR PROGRAM IN FISCAL AFFAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. OVERSEES TWELVE DEPARTMENTS AND FIVE OFFICE AS WE SERVE AT WE PROVIDE A RANGE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES INCOME ASSISTANCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. TO ALL CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPECIFICALLY TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING. AND AS A GOVERNOR NOTED INSTEAD OF THE STATE OF DRESS IT'S TIME FOR US ALL TO COME TOGETHER AND REALLY TACKLE THIS HAD ON IT MUST ADDRESS PERSON CENTER CARE THE PATCHWORK OF PUBLIC PROGRAM PROGRAMS. SOCIAL ISOLATION BED LOCK SENIORS IN NEED OF TRANSPORTATION IN ADDITION TO MANY OTHER THINGS. AND WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT HAS NO BOUNDARIES AGING DOESN'T CARE WHAT RACE YOU ARE WHAT ECONOMIC STATUS YOU ARE OR IF YOU'RE SINGLE WITH NO OTHER FAMILY SUPPORT. AND AS MY OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO WORKS ON THE PANEL AT DESCRIBED YOU ALL ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT THAT WILL FACE IN THE COMING DECADE. NOT ONLY WILL WE SEE A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS. THAT ARE GONNA BE OLDER BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO SEE A SHIFT IN THE COMPOSITION OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE COHORT OF OLDER ADULTS IS MORE LIKELY TO BE SINGLE. CHILDLESS MORE ETHNICALLY DIVERSE LIVE ALONE AND LIVE IN POVERTY. THERE IS NO SINGLE PROGRAMMER POLICY THAT'S GONNA PREPARES FOR THE SHIFT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A COMBINATION OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. AND WE MUST WORK TOGETHER BOTH YOUNG AND OLD AND PRIVATE SECTOR AND PUBLIC SECTOR. AND EVEN INDIVIDUALS LIKE MYSELF MILLNNIALS WE HAVE TO COME TO THIS TABLE. A ONE THIRD OF US OUR CURRENT CARE GIVERS ANOTHER THIRD WILL BE CARE GIVERS IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND AS MANY PEOPLE ALLUDED TO WE ALSO WILL AGE SO WE HAVE TO BE AT THIS TABLE. AS PART OF OUR WORK ON THE MASTER PLAN AN AGING WE HAVE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW WE DELIVER OUR PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. I THINK THIS IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO ENSURE THAT THE DELIVERY OF OUR PUBLIC PROGRAMS. ARE CENTERED ON THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE OUR CLIENTS. FOR DECADES PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND SERVICES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO DELIVER TO SUPPORT THE STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER INDIVIDUALS LIKE MRS JONES. THEY DON'T LIVE THEIR LIVES IN SILOS. OUR VISION FOR THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING IS THAT IT WILL SERVE AS A BLUEPRINT THAT CAN BE USED BY STATE GOVERNMENT. LOCAL GOVERNMENT BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS AND PHILANTHROPY TO BUILT ENVIRONMENTS A PROPOSED HEALTHY AGING. AND I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THIS IS NOT JUST GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO THIS ALONE WE MUST DO THIS TOGETHER. WE CAN ONLY DO THIS COLLECTIVELY PRESSURING IDEAS AND CONNECTING PEOPLE STORIES AND DATA WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY ENSURING THAT OLDER CALIFORNIANS CAN AGENT PLACE AND WITH THE DIGNITY. SO THE QUESTION BEFORE US TRULY IS HOW CAN WE CREATE AN AGING FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES FOR ALL ALL OLDER ADULTS. THIS MEANS THAT OUR WORK MUST GO BEYOND JUST THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT UNDERLYING SOCIAL FACTORS LIKE SO THANK HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION AND FOOD. HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON INDIVIDUALS WELL BEING AND AND HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THIS IS TRUE FOR CHILDREN AS MUCH AS IT IS FOR ADULTS AND OLDER ADULTS AS WELL. ADDITIONALLY THE MASTER PLAN MUST NOT ONLY FOCUS ON PUBLIC PROGRAMS WE ADMINISTER IN MUST BE INCLUSIVE OF ALL OLDER CALIFORNIANS. THERE ARE MANY OLDER CALIFORNIANS THAT DON'T UTILIZE OUR PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND WE MUST ENCOMPASS THEM AS WELL. FINALLY THE MASTER PLAN MUST BE ACTIONABLE WE HAVE TO HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE. AND WE MUST DEVELOP CONCISE METRICS THAT WILL HELP US EVALUATE OUR PROGRESS. SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE TO ACT WITH URGENCY HOWEVER THERE ARE NUMBER STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE AND HAVE TAKEN TO SET THE FOUNDATION TO ACCELERATE THIS WORK AT THE AGENCY. FIRST WERE BETTER LEVERAGING PUBLIC DATA WE'RE DATA RICH BUT INFORMATION POOR WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WE COLLECT A LOT OF DATA BUT WE DO A POOR JOB USING IT TURN FORMER. PROGRAM DELIVERY DATA MUST INFORM THE MASTER PLAN AND IT CAN HELP IMPROVE PROGRAM OUT REACH SERVICE DELIVERY AND ULTIMATELY CLIENT LIVES. SECOND WE'RE CHANGING THE CULTURE AND WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION WE MUST FOCUS ON HOW WE BETTER DELIVER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. TOO OFTEN WERE FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPING PROGRAMS BASED ON WHAT'S CONVENIENT WITHIN THE SILO STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT. THE MASTER PLAN MUST ENVISION A SYSTEM OF PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT'S EASY TO NAVIGATE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CONSUMER. AND AS GOVERNMENT IT'S OUR DUTY TO ENSURE THAT WE WRAP THESE PROGRAMS AROUND THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. FINALLY WE'RE DEVELOPING PROGRAMS WITH OUR CLIENTS NOT FOR THEM THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO ENGAGE OUR CLIENTS MEETING FLEET IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. SO THAT THEY ARE PART OF IT SO THE MASTER ENGAGE INDIVIDUALS LIKE MRS JONES. BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT WE ARE ULTIMATELY BUILDING THE PLAN FOR SO IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS WE HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION WILL ENGAGE CLIENTS STAKEHOLDERS AND CERTAINLY YOU AS THE LEGISLATURE. ON THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONNECTING YOUR IDEAS. THOUGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS I'D LIKE TO FINISH BY UNDERSCORING THE GOVERNMENT'S VISION FOR CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS OUR SOCIAL CONTRACT THIS IS OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS THAT WE BUILD A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN H. WITH INDIGNITY. MANY LEGISLATORS INCLUDING YOURSELF DOCTOR PAN HAVE ADVOCATED FOR MASTER PLAN AN AGING WE THANK YOU IT'S TIME FOR US TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND GET TO WORK TOGETHER I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND I'M. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE ALL THE PANELISTS PRESENTATION -- I HAVE TO STEP OUT JUST FOR A FEW MOMENTS I'M GONNA PASS GAVEL TO CENTER STONE BUT I'M SURE BOTH CENTER STONE HER TADO HAVE QUESTIONS AND BY THE TIME I GET BACK I CAN GET IN MY QUESTIONS THAT. THREATENS THEIR STUFF. THANK YOU DOCTOR BROWN -- CENTER RICARDO WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO START WITH MY QUESTIONS OR DO YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WE'LL START WITH OKAY. WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR INFORMATIVE -- A PRESENTATIONS -- IN APPRECIATE -- SO MANY MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE THAT ARE HERE TODAY THAT SHOW OF CONCERN. FOR BUT I I THOUGHT I WOULD OFTEN CALLED THE THE SILVER TSUNAMI WITH -- WITH THIS IS LANDED IT LANDED RIGHT. AND WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS IT -- I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE LA -- IN MY ROOM IN THE SENIOR POPULATION OF THOSE SIXTY FIVE YEARS AND OLDER AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. THAT MEANS I HAVE TWO MORE YEARS OF USE BEFORE -- I BECOME OFFICIALLY PART OF OF THE GROUP. SO -- YOU KNOW. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN HAVING THIS MASTER PLAN. IS -- TO DO WHAT WASN'T DONE -- DECADES AGO IN PREPARING FOR THIS EVENTUALITY -- WHEN I WAS GROWING UP MY MY GRANDPARENTS WERE GETTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MY PARENTS AND THE FINANCIAL SECURITY OF COURSE WHEN SOCIAL SECURITY -- FIRST CAME OUT AND WOMEN MY GRANDPARENTS WERE THE BENEFICIARIES OF IT ACTUALLY YOU CASH YOU LIVE ON IT. HE ACTUALLY PAY RENT YOU COULD ACTUALLY FEED YOURSELF AND GO TO THE DOCTOR AND NOW YOU'LL FAST TRACK TODAY YOU LOOK AT THE VERY MODEST INCREASES THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS -- IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY CHALLENGING FOR ANYONE. TO TO HONESTLY SAY THAT THEY CAN LIVE ON JUST -- SO SECURITY ALONE THAT SAYS IT IS APPALLING SO -- SO WITH THAT SAID. IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS REAL MASTER PLAN -- I THINK A PART OF THAT IS -- REACHING OUT TO OUR MILLENNIALS REACHING OUT TO OUR OUR OUR YOUNGSTERS ARE MIDDLE CLASS. AND AND HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF EMBRACING PROGRAMS THAT WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO BE IN THE POSITION -- THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN TODAY. AND SO. ARE A NOTICE ONE OF THE THE SHOCKING STATISTICS FOR ME WAS THAT. OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT GET -- L. T. S. HELP -- ONLY 5% OF THEM. HAVE BOUGHT LONG TERM LONG TERM INSURANCE 5% I MEAN -- SO TO THE TO MAYBE THE EIGHTH -- PANEL IN PARTICULAR DR ROBERT -- IT'S IT'S VERY VERY WONDERFUL HAVING YOU HERE FROM A VERY PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY THEY WERE VERY LUCKY THAT WE HAVE SOMEBODY YOUR CALIBER HERE TODAY SO -- AS AS A FELLOW TROJAN I'M I'M DELIGHTED TO HEAR I WAS. WHAT WHITE WHY IS IT THAT -- THERE ARE BARRIERS FOR FOR MEDICAL LAST CALIFORNIANS TODAY -- TO PLANNED THIS THIS EVENTUAL FUTURE -- AND AND AND WHY DO YOU THINK. THAT -- WE ONLY SEE 5% OF CALIFORNIANS THAT BOTTLE AS LONG TERM INSURANCE -- REFLECT THE THE OVERWHELMING NEED THAT WE'RE GONNA BE SAYING IN THE FUTURE. SO I THINK THERE'S SEVERAL ANSWERS TO THAT -- ONE IS THAT WHEN IT'S INEXPENSIVE TO BUY IT IS WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG YEAH BUT WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT EDUCATING YOURSELF. OF MORTGAGE MAY BE -- SAVING FOR RETIREMENT GETTING YOUR KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE HIGHER PRIORITIES IF YOU IN FACT. HAVE ANY DISCRETIONARY INCOME TO PUT TOWARDS THOSE THINGS. BUT AS YOU REACH RETIREMENT AGE AND BEYOND WHEN YOU REALLY START THINKING YOU NEED LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. IT'S PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE IMAGE THE INSURERS SNOW THAT IT'S AN INSURED EVENTS THAT IS UP ALSO IT'S DIFFICULT TO COST IT OUT FAR AWAY. AND SO AND SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS IS AN INSURANCE PRODUCTS -- THERE HAVE BEEN. EFFORTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT BUT PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO AS YOU KNOW TO EVEN SAVE FOR RETIREMENT BEYOND CELS SECURITY. SO LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE SEEMS LIKE. OF SOMETHING THAT'S DOWN THE ROAD IN TERMS OF A PRIORITY FOR MANY PEOPLE AND THEN I'LL JUST SAY ONE OTHER THING -- THE PRODUCT ITSELF. IS NOT ALL THAT GREAT OFTEN AND SO DOES IT INCLUDE INFLATION -- WE'VE SEEN SOME PEOPLE PURCHASE IT AND THEN THE PRODUCT IS NO LONGER THERE SO WE NEED A LOT OF SAFEGUARDS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO AS WELL. WOULD YOU SEE WOULD YOU SEE IS GOVERNMENT'S ROLE SHOULD GOVERNMENT -- ESTABLISH SOME TYPE OF A FUND. THAT OUR CITIZENS CAN CONTRIBUTE. VOLUNTARILY -- TO INSURE THAT THEY HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT HELP AND RESOURCES WHEN THEY RETIRE SO. I I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF WE STILL HAVE THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT THAT SEEMED LIKE. A MODEL THAT PEOPLE COULD PARTICIPATE IN. SO A CALIFORNIA AND THREE OTHER STATES HAVE A PROGRAM WHERE YOU COULD INSURE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ASSETS -- YOU COULD DECIDE AND THEN WHEN YOU HAD SPENT DOWN TO THOSE ASSETS. THEN YOU COULD GO ON STATE MATTER CAL AND SO IT WAS A WAY TO TO KIND OF OFFER A PROTECTION AND MAYBE -- OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE AT THE HEARING NOW IF THIS IN FACT AND MAYBE AT LONG WOULD HAVE KNOWN. IT DOES THIS EXIST -- THIS WAS A THIS WAS A BIG IDEA AND THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES IN CALIFORNIA WAS A LEADER -- SO. I I THINK THERE ARE SOME MODELS BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT A LOT OF VERY SMART PEOPLE HAVE WORKED ON THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND HAVEN'T COME UP WITH ANY KIND OF PANACEA FOR IT OKAY. ONE THING IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT IS CREATING A LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE STATE PROGRAM SIMILAR TO DISABILITY INSURANCE. WHICH BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL AND EMPLOYER POSSIBLY THE STATE COULD COULD PAIN. TOO AND I THINK THE PLACE TO LOOK AT THE FEASIBILITY OF THAT WOULD BE SOMEHOW CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO SPEND DOWN. THEIR SAVINGS AND USE MEDI CAL MEDICAID TO PAY FOR THEIR LONG TERM CARE. WHEN A WHEN THEY GO INTO A NURSING HOME AND SEE YOU KNOW DO A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS ON? HOW MUCH DOES COST COULD BE DIVERTED BY CREATING THIS STATE LONG TERM INSURANCE PLAN WITH THE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY OTHER STATES SORT OF -- TAKEN ON AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM LIKE THIS I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE SOMEBODY MUST HAVE BUT I IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IT I HAVEN'T HEARD. THOSE EXAMS DOCTOR WILBUR MY NO THAT'LL BE AFFORDED WHICH WAS A WAY TO FUND LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. IT WAS THE FIRST THING TO GO BECAUSE THE THE NUMBERS DIDN'T WORK AL THAT WELL. SO AGAIN I THINK THIS. THIS IS A HUGE CHALLENGE AND ONE OTHER THING IS THAT. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO ENSURE AGAINST FACILITY PLACEMENT OF SO THE PRODUCT NEEDS. TO INCLUDE HOME COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES BUT HOW MUCH DO THOSE COSTS IN HALF HOW DO YOU MANAGE THAT SO I WISH I COULD. BE MORE HOPEFUL AND SAY YEP -- MINNESOTA DOESN'T HERE'S HOW IT IS IT WORKS GREAT BUT WELL WE LIVE THE GOLDEN STATE AND I THINK OUR OUR OUR OUR CITIZENS WHEN THEY REACH THEIR GOLDEN AGE. SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE IN DIGNITY AND IN CASE OF AND AND NOT HAVE TO TO WORRY -- WHERE THE RENT CHECKS AND COME FROM WHERE THEY'RE? WERE THERE OTHER MONEY FOR THE MEDICATIONS GOING TO COME FROM THEIR FOOD -- SO YOU KNOW. I'M I'M SOME TYPE OF A MASTER PLAN THEY THEY GIVE SAID ASSURANCES SO -- CEDARS CAN LIVE IN PEACE. AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE IN THEIR AND THEIR GOAL AND THEIR GOOD YEARS WHEN EXPOSED TO BE ENJOYING THEIR LIVES. I WILL TAKE THIS BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES AND SEE I'M SURE THERE ARE THINGS THAT I'VE MISSED AND IF I FIND SOMETHING THAT'S PROMISING I'LL MAKE IT AVAILABLE THANK YOU -- SO I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE -- HEARING THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING THAT ACTUALLY -- FIRST OF ALL I HAVE A BILL -- TO LOOK AT IN ACTUAL ANALYSIS IN FACT AND WE ALSO HAVE A BUDGET PROPOSAL INVESTMENT WE'RE GONNA HERE LATER ON TODAY. THAT LOOKS AT THIS VERY ISSUE SO IT'S ASKING FOR A BUT A JAZZ ALLOCATION TO DO A FEASIBILITY ACTUAR ANALYSIS OF BASICALLY FINING FINANCE YOU'LL TO SUPPORT FINANCING SERVICES OPTIONS AROUND A LONG TERM CARE. AND SO FORTH SO -- I REALIZE IT'S A TOUGH NOT IT'S ONE THAT WE WANT TO TRY TAKE ON SO THAT -- WE CAN HELP THE THEIR SUPPORT -- MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH THIS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW OUR CURRENT OPTION IS SPEND DOWN ON MEDI CAL AIMED AT THAT THAT SAID AND TWITTER. ESSENTIALLY THE STATE IS PAYING YOU KNOW FOR AT A GOOD JOHNNY ON THE HALF IN THE FEDERAL AND ITS IT'S AND BASICALLY. WE EXPECT FAMILIES TO DRIVE HIMSELF IN THE POVERTY FIRST. AND THEN -- AND AND THAT AND THEN WE BUT IN AN INSTITUTION SO -- WHEN WE WERE TRYING -- TO GROW STRAIGHT CREEL OPTIONS SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THIS IS ATION SO ANYTHING WE LOOK THE MASTER PLAN WILL LOOK AT THESE WELL LOOK SAID FIGURE OUT WHAT THE VISION IS AND I APPRECIATE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION SAYING. RIGHT SO WHAT WHAT IS A WHAT WE WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND THEN THINK ABOUT HOW WE GO ABOUT GETTING THERE CERTAINLY THIS IS ONE THE STEPS WHILE LOOK AT IS HOW CAN WE HELP. BETTER -- FINANCING OPTIONS THAT -- WORK FOR OKAY S. FAN YOU CAN HAVE SELF SELECTION AT EIGHT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE TO SAY WE CAN ONLY DEPEND ON THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM SO. FAR WE HAVE TO LOOK AT NINE ONE ONE MORE THING. SO -- IT USED TO BE THAT YOU HAVE A CUTE PRIMARY CARE AND LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND YOU SEE THOSE COMING TOGETHER AND WE SEE WAYS THAT WE CAN SAVE ON THE ACUTE CARE SIDE OF COURSE. THAT'S MEDICARE -- AND SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD WORK COMING OUT OF BROWN THAT SHOWS THAT. HOME DELIVER NUTRITION PROGRAMS SAVE HOSPITALIZATIONS. SO IT'S SORT OF THINKING ABOUT WHERE ARE THE DOLLARS THAT COULD BE DEVOTED IF WE HAD. A BETTER INTEGRATION OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT OF LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. QUESTION SENATOR TADA YES MISTER CHAIR. SO A MISMATCH I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET A CENTER NAY MENTION THE THREE STEPS -- THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF TIME OF WHEN YOU. CAN PLAN ON COMPLETING THIS OR IF IT'S JUST AN ONGOING THING JUST WANT TO GET MORE OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK THE THE THINGS THAT I OUTLINED OR THINGS THAT ARE IN. PROGRESS NOW WE HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY THE GOVERNOR HAS -- HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE THIS IS NOT ACT. THE MULTI YEAR EFFORT THIS HAS TO HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY SO I THINK WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AND MONTHS WE WILL BE ENGAGING BOTH STAKEHOLDERS LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS. TO REALLY THINK THOUGHTFULLY ABOUT WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE AND IT CAN BE A DRAWN OUT PROCESS THAT TAKES YEARS IT HAS TO BE WE HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY ON THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND MAKE NOTE OF THE WORK THAT -- FORMER SERIK CAROL LOU DID -- SHE HAS SELECT COMMITTEE ON AGING I THINK SHE PRODUCED THIS CHART WHICH SHOWED ALL THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT PROGRAMS OUT ONE HAND YOU GO LOOK AT IT YOU SEE ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AT THE OTHER HAND. THERE'S A LOT MISSING ELEMENTS RIGHT. AS WELL AND SO -- I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE THE BILL DEVELOP A VISION AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW IT'S THAT SITTING THERE SAYING WHAT SILOS DO WE HAVE AND I THINK WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF THE CONVERSATION WE TALK ABOUT FARM AGING WE ARE BY AN S.. P. AND RESIZE WHAT WE TALK ABOUT THIS PIECE BUT THERE'S A MEDI CAL PIECE WHICH WILL BE HEARING THIS SUBCOMMITTEE LATER ON AND AND THOSE. TO MEET RIGHT AND BUT THEY'RE BEING HEARD DIFFERENT TIMES AND SO FORTH SO -- ISN'T ACTUALLY DISPOSSESSED A MASTER PLAN THAT'S GOOD -- THAT'S AND I APPRECIATE WE NEED TO MOVE SPEEDILY ON THIS -- SO HOW HOW. HOW DO YOU TREAT THIS VISION FOR IT IS EVIDENCE BASED VISION -- FOR FOR AGING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I MEAN IS THERE A PARTICULAR -- DEAL IS THERE A PARTICULAR STATE OR OTHER NATION THAT WE LOOK AT THAT IT'S DONE THAT BEFORE WE PLOWING WE GOT TO BUILD THIS WE'RE PLOWING NEW GROUND FOR CELLS I WAS WE HAVE UNITARY CALIFORNIA CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL. HOW HOW HOW DO YOU ENVISION THE PROCESS FOR DOING THAT I APPRECIATE THE SPEED PART BUT WE ALSO HEARD ABOUT WE NEED TO ENGAGE? THE THAT. THEY ON SENIORS WE NEED TO DO REACHED THERE'S A PART THE STATE IT CETERA. ALL THAT TAKES SOME TIME SO I I'VE USED THE FINAL LAB RATE ON WHETHER THERE'S EXISTING WORK THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO BUILD ON AS WELL AS WHAT KIND OF THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THAT FROM. YEAH SO MAYBE I CAN START CENTER I THINK YOU MAKE A REALLY GOOD POINT I THINK THAT. YOU REALLY -- OUR PROGRAMS ARE SILO IT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO THAT AT A NECESSITY BECAUSE GOVERNMENT THAT'S HOW GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS BY. LIKE I NOTED THAT'S NOT HOW PEOPLE'S LIVES WORK AND SO WE HAVE TO REALLY THINK HOLISTICALLY ABOUT. IF PEOPLE ARE COMING TO OUR AGENCY AND COMING THROUGH FIVE DIFFERENT OORS AND PROVIDING THE SAME INFORMATION FIVE DIFFERENT TIMES AS OUR MORE INNOVATIVE WAY FOR US TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE DELIVER THOSE SERVICES -- AND I THINK THAT THAT WE NEED TO PUT ON STEROIDS THAT CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO PUT ON STEROIDS AND THINK REALLY THOUGHTFULLY ABOUT WHAT WE DO THERE -- IN TERMS OF THE MASTER PLAN I THINK THERE IS BOTH STUFF THAT HAS HAPPENED OR A WORK THAT HAS HAPPENED BOTH WITHIN GOVERNMENT AND OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT. DR WILBUR'S WORK ON CARE GIVING AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DONE PHENOMENAL WORK ON THIS WE HAVE TO BUILD ON TOP OF IT THERE'S NO NEED TO RECREATE THE WHEEL. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH METRICS THIS ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH METRICS AROUND. THINGS THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE PERHAPS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND REALLY HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE BOTH. BROUGHT ON THE PRIVATE SIDE AND THE PUBLIC SIDE TO SAY HOW ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS US METRICS -- AND SO I THINK PART OF THE MASTER PLAN IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT DOES -- HEALTHY AGING LOOK LIKE IN THE STATE AND IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE COAST. BUT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT A MORE HOLISTICALLY AND THEN SET THOSE PARAMETERS SO THAT WE CAN BE MEASURING TOWARDS THEM OVER TIME. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE THAT LONG TERM CARE BE SOMEHOW. PUT IN WITH MEDI CAL IS PART OF THE IF THEY SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND YOU KNOW UP. PUT IT IS PART OF THE MEDI CAL BENEFITS SORE HOWEVER WASTE THE GOVERNMENT DOES IT. IF NEEDED. EVERYBODY'S NOT GONNA LIVE AND WHEN YOU PAY INTO A LONG I HAD A LONG TERM CARE POLICY WHEN I WAS YOUNG. BUT YOU CAN'T COULD TOO BECAUSE I HAD THREE KIDS RIGHT. AND MYSELF THE HOUSE TO COLLIDE IN. IN TIME IN LIFE SELL IT I'D I DIDN'T CONTINUE IT SO ALL THE MONEY YOU PUT INTO A LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. WHO IS A GO IS HIS GUN RIGHT? RIGHT [inaudible] NOT. GONE. YES WELL AT THE AGE THAT STOCK TO ENSURE ANY GOES INTO A POOL WHICH THEN RIGHT -- SOME OF IT NAY VI YOU NEVER USE IT. RIGHT IF YOU DIE. WHICH WE KNOW WILL YOU FEET IF YOU DON'T NEED TO GO INTO A LONG TERM CARE FACILITY THEN. THAT IS THAT RIGHT WELL AT THE THE WITHOUT GOING TO BED TO THE BACK AND FORTH SO FIRST OF ALL -- THE AND ACTUALLY -- MEDI CAL THOSE GRAYSON WITH MEDICARE THAT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT. BECAUSE FOR SENIORS MEDICARE STARTS OPINION IS BEING THE MAIN PAYER FOR HEALTH CARE -- AND THEN WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INSURANCE. YOU DO COUNT ON THE FACT THAT IF YOU DO THAT IN AN INSURANCE POOL THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE GREATER NEEDS EL AND SOME PEOPLE OF LESSER NEEDS. RIGHT AND WE DON'T KNOW AND AND WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHO IT'S GOING TO BE BUT THAT YES I MEAN YOU DO NEED A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE LEE DON'T NEED IT BUT THEY BOUGHT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO NEED IT -- AND THERE'S A PEOPLE WHO END UP NEEDING AND THAT'S HOW YOU AVERAGE THAT'S HOW YOU SOCIALIZE AVERAGE OUT THE COSTS AMONGST EVERYONE. RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE SO SECURITY PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF TIME IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU YEAH THAT IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU LEFT HE LIVES. YET EVEN LIVE AS LONG THAT. THERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE PEOPLE LIVE LONGER SO SO ANYTIME WE TALK ABOUT INSURANCE WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT WE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE DO WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF PROFITS OR OTHER TYPE THING TO GET THE WORD OUT THE POOL. BUT YOU DO NEED TO PULL IN ORDER TO MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE OTHERWISE OTHERWISE EVERYONE'S BACK TO PAYING FOR THEMSELVES RATE SO LOW I NEED DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT I DON'T NEED AT ALL THEY DON'T PAY FOR IT AND THEN. THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD. YEAH MOST PEOPLE AREN'T MINNESOTA FINANCIAL POSITION TO PAY FOR ALL THEIR LONG TERM CARE THEMSELVES WE DON'T FIND A WAY TO CREATE A POOL. SORRY FOR THE LONG TALKED BUT NOW YOU SAY. LONG TERM CARE IS IT IT IS PART OF MEDI CAL WE THAT'S CERTAINLY A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF OUR MEDI CAL BUDGETS PAYING FOR LONG TERM CARE AND ALSO OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT AYE HSS TODAY AND OTHER. SO WE DO HAVE WE DO PAY THROUGH MEDIC HOW FOR DIFFERENT SERVICES HOPEFULLY MANY OF THEM WE ACTUALLY WANT TO SUPPORT MORE BECAUSE THEY KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES AND OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. YES. QUESTION ABOUT HOW DO WE GET TO THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING I THINK THE DEPUTY SECRETARY IS OUTLINED SOME REALLY NICE STEPS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE IS COMPONENT TO THAT. MAKING SURE WE HAVE STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE. AND WE NEED TO THINK OF THAT I THINK WE NEED TO PRIVATE PUBLIC NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BUT ALSO THE FEDERAL FUNDING SIDE THE STATE FUNDING SIDE AND LOCAL FUNDING SITE WHICH IS A HUGE PIECE OF IT. SO THAT SHOULD BE PART OF IT -- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT. THIS NEEDS TO BE A LIVING PLAN AND EVOLVING PLAN BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET IT RIGHT IN A YEAR. OR EVEN TWO YEARS IT'S WAY TOO HARD TO DO THAT. AND SO MANY TIMES I'VE SEEN GREAT PROJECTS THAT NEVER LAUNCH BECAUSE WE SPEND ALL THIS TIME TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO MAKE TIME OF THE ESSENCE AND PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE WITH THE ADMISSION UP FRONT THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE BUT WE NEED TO START TAKING ACTION. IF WE MAKE IT ACCOUNTABLE THEN THOSE CORRECTIONS AND THAT EVOLUTION WILL NATURALLY BE BUILT INTO IT SO RELEASE A SIMPLE TO DO THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO URGE THAT THE IMPORTANT THING IS WE DO SOMETHING. NOT WAIT FOR PERFECTION. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY WELL I'D AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE -- EVERYONE PRESENT HERE THIS IS -- WE'RE TRYING TO WATCH IT IS ONE THING I WOULD MAKE NOTE -- IS IS THAT -- I APPRECIATE YOU SAID THAT THIS INVOLVES FEDERAL STATE LOCAL AND FOR EXAMPLE -- JUST RAISE YOUR TO BUDGET SUB HEARING YOU KNOW AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN S. S. P.. THAT'S COMING FROM A DIFFERENT PART OF MONEY MONEY THAT FROM THE FED START COMING THROUGH RIGHT AND SO -- SO WE ALSO TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT WE HAVE FEDERAL SILOS FUNDING SILOS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND WILL. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T. YEAH OF COURSE FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRIDGE THOSE THAT WILL GET THINK HOW IS A STATE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MANTA AND THEN ALSO PERHAPS LEAN ON SOME OF OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO GIVE US THE KIND OF FLEXIBILITY. TO BE ABLE TO PROCESS SALAS TO MAKE MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR FUNDS AS WELL SO. I THINK I APPRECIATE THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE THE GOVERNOR IN THIS -- AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SAID ADMINISTRATION CERTAINLY HERE IN THE SENATE THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY I KNOW -- CENTER TODD DOES CHAIR OF THE HUMAN SERVICES -- I UNDERSTAND IT'S A PRIORITY THE OTHER SPEAK FOR HERSELF IT'S SO -- AND AND AND A IS THAT NO THAT THE CENTER STONE -- IS OUR VERY GOOD FRIEND FROM ACROSS THE ISLAND. SO THIS IS A BIPARTISAN OF PRIORITY WITH ALL OF YOU -- AND AND AND BE SURE WE TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE THAT IS FOR THEM SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE IN THE SAME POSITION. HOPEFULLY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. OKAY. THANK YOU. OKAY SO NEXT ITEM WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO NOW IS THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE -- SO [inaudible] RIGHT. SO WE CAN BRING UP PLAIN OF SERVER HERE. RIGHT HE IS PRESENTING HAIR OKAY. ACTUALLY ISSUES IS PRESENTING HERE A NAME PERSON HERE. OKAY YES SO -- THE BRING UP THE SEE LEGISLATURE OF THE LA OWN FINANCE STAFF OKAY AND SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS HAVE EVERYONE INTRODUCE THEMSELVES THE RECORD AND THEN WE'LL GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH THE PRESENTATION THE OVERVIEW PRESENTATION. SO IF YOU LIKE. TO FOR THE RECORD -- FOR YOUR MACHINE ABOUT JUSTICE THANK YOU HELLO. THANK YOU JACKIE BRAZIL ILIO. JANIE BELL LA -- THANK YOU FINANCE WHISPERS WROTE APARTMENT FINANCE YOU. PLEASE BEGIN. PARTICIPATE IN THE LONG TERM CARE. IT'S A CHALLENGE TO STAY. IN LONG TERM CARE SO I'VE HAD TO RESORT. TO OUR COMPRESSING THE INFLATION FACTOR. IN ORDER TO STAY IN THAT PLAN MY CONCERN IS I'M NOT SURE THE PLANS CAN BE AROUND. BY THE TIME BECAUSE I THINK THE POOL JUST CAN CONTINUALLY SHRINK AS PEOPLE NO LONGER CAN AFFORD IT SO IT'S IT'S AWFULLY SCARY. IN TERMS OF THAT SO I JUST SORRY I WANTED TO DEVIATE FOR JUST A MINUTE YEAH WELL THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO DO A STUDY IN THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE HAVE A POOL THAT'S LARGE ENOUGH AND KEEP IT LARGE ENOUGH RIGHT EXACTLY. EXACTLY TO POOL SIZES KEY YES ALL RIGHT SENIOR LEGISLATURE THANK YOU CHAIRMAN PAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE U.. YOUR COMMITTEE TODAY. I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE A STATE AGENCY CELEBRATING ITS THIRTY EIGHTH YEAR ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS. AN AGENCY THAT HAS OVER TWO HUNDRED LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL SIGNED INTO LAW. OVER THE SAME THIRTY EIGHT YEAR PERIOD. I'D LIKE TO START. WITH A REMINDER THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE PRESENTED TO THIS COMMITTEE A THREE YEAR FINANCING PLAN. AS PART OF A REFERENCE TO CONTINUOUSLY CONTINUOUSLY FUN CSL. AIR AND REQUESTED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. AS YOU RECALL. OUR REQUEST FOR CONTINUES FUNNY TO NOT MAKE IT OUT OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. SINCE THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN LEGISLATIVE SESSION CSL SUBMITTED A PCP. FOR CONTINUOUS FUNDING FOR INCLUSION IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. BUT WE WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET. WE HAVE CONTINUED OUR PURSUIT OF CONTINUOUS FUNDING. THROUGH THE FUNDING LETTER WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLANCA RUBIO CHAMPIONING OUR REQUEST. THREE YEAR FINANCING PLAN. THE PLAN NOTED ABOVE WITH THE RESULT OF A TWENTY SEVENTEEN LEGISLATIVE SESSION. THE ASSEMBLY CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET THE NUMBER ONE REQUESTED DEAL WITH CSL IN LA YOU KNOW WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE FUNDING OF CSL. AS A RESULT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS HE ALSO RESPONDED. BY CURTAILING EXPENSES IN THE ERROR IS A PRINTING POSTAGE. AND HOUSE CSL CONDUCTS ITS ANNUAL SESSION. THE PLAN ALSO NOTED THAT THE SEAL SO WAS TO IDENTIFY LARGER DEPARTMENTS OR AGENCIES THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY UP SORT. CSL ACCOUNTING AND OTHER TGS CONTRACTED WORKLOAD. WELL THE CSO MET WITH OTHER AGENCIES NO SOLUTIONS BEEN FOUND TODAY. THIS IS QUESTIONS CONCLUDED WITH THE LEGISLATURE REQUESTING AT CSL PROVIDE AN UPDATE TO THEM IN JANUARY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN REGARDING A LONG TERM FINANCING PLAN. THAT'S WHAT I REFER TO AS THE THREE YEAR FINANCING PLAN. AT THIS DOCUMENTS ABOUT TEN PAGES IN LENGTH. ARE IN THE PLANTS HERE SO REFERENCE TO CONTINUE TO RISE IN SALARY AND BENEFITS AND FIXED COSTS LIKE STATE FEES. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THESE COSTS REPRESENTED 36% TOTAL EXPENSES. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE TOTAL EIGHTY AND 69%. IN TWENTY NINETEEN WERE PROJECTING THEY WILL TOTAL 76%. THE JOB IS THE RESULT OF A A RECENT VISIT BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. CONDUCTED A CYBER SECURITY AUDIT -- IN A LEARNING THIS THAT WILL BE AUDITED IN THE FUTURE EVERY TWO AND FOUR YEARS. THAT'S THE THREE YEAR FINANCING PLAN. OUR AND PREPARE TO SPEAK TO THE INCREASE FUNDING OUR ISSUE NOTED IN THE AGENDA AS WELL OR TAKE QUESTIONS YOUR RUN. WHICHEVER YOU PREFER GERMAN OKAY WELL -- WHEN WE -- TO START -- ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM ALEJO ON THE OVERVIEW AND A THREE YEAR PLAN. JUST AS WAS MENTIONED -- AND SEE ESOS OPENING COMMENTS WE WERE ASKED -- TO TWO YEARS AGO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH TO LOOK INTO THE BUDGETING AND THINGS THAT CAME UP DURING THAT CONVERSATION WAR -- A PORT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE BUDGET WAS TIED TO THE SPECS COSTS THEN CAME THIS CONVERSATION OF WELCOME OTHER DEPARTMENTS ABSORB THOSE FIXED COSTS TO REDUCE COST PRESSURES NCSL. CONCERN -- STANDING ABOUT THAT OPTION WAS EXPLORED BUT ISSUES OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH CSL BEING A LOBBYING INSTITUTION AND HOW -- FOR FOR THAT ORGANIZATION TO BE INCORPORATED ADMINISTRATION COULD RAISE SOME ISSUES OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST -- BUT WITH REGARDS TO THE CURRENT PROPOSAL -- WELL IT'S NOT IT INCLUDED IN JANUARY'S BUDGET AND JANUARY BUDGET. BASED ON THE COMMENTS IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS SOME PROPOSAL BEING MADE. FOR POSSIBLE CONTINUATION GENERAL FUND IN THE JANUARY BUDGET IT IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ENOUGH MONEY COMING IN FROM THE TAX. ACCOUNT -- TO FIND THEIR SOURCES BUT WE SAW ON PREVIOUS YEARS THAT THAT HASN'T NECESSARILY BEEN THE CASE SO THIS CALL THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT ONGOING GENERAL FUND IT WOULD JUST BE A MATTER OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES OKAY FINANCE. YEAH JUST TWO QUICK THINGS ABOUT JUST FOR THE RECORD AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN SENIOR LEGISLATURE SAFELY MAINTAINED ITS TAX CHECK OFF STATUS. WHICH ESTABLISHED THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR CITIZEN VOLUNTARY TAX CONTRIBUTION FUND. AND AS NOTING THE ATTENDANCE ABOUT NINETY ONE THOUSAND AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WE'RE STILL WAITING TO SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT HAS -- IT WAS FORWARD AND THE BILL ITSELF MADE MANDATED 10% OF THE REVENUES BE USED FOR MARKETING CAMPAIGN I BELIEVE. CSL HAS ALREADY SECURED -- SOMEONE TO DO THAT SO THERE'S THAT ISSUE TO CONSIDER AND THEN JUST FOR THE RECORD IN APPROPRIATED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND GENERAL FUND ONE TIME. AND ALSO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ANOTHER ONE TIME GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION OF TURN TO SEVNTY FIVE THOUSAND THESE HAVE BEEN RE APPROPRIATED AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT -- FOR CURRENT YEAR FOR SO FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIS GENERAL FUND MONEY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN APPROPRIATED SHOULD COVER [inaudible] YOUR EXPENDITURES [inaudible] IN IN. NOT TO GET TOO MUCH INTO THE WEEDS SO EXACTLY. WHAT DO YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY ON TO HOW MUCH IS STAFF AND SO WE HAVE THESE -- PRORATED FEES AND SALARIES AND BENEFITS AND SO FORTH I'M JUST A SELECT. THERE WAS A YOUNG IT SO I MEAN THAT IN TERMS OF HATS I'LL BE STAFF HOW ME TELL ME PAID STAFF MEMBERS EIGHT STAFF SO WE HAVE OKAY SO WE HAVE SO BASICALLY ISSUES OF ONE PAID STAFF RIGHT. TO OF COURSE AS SALARY BENEFITS AND THE OVERHEAD RELATE TO HAVING A STAFF PERSON AND AND WHAT PORTION OF THE BUDGET IS THOUGH. WHEN PAID STAFF PERSON? SO. IN ROUND NUMBERS AT APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. OKAY SO THAT'S A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE SALARY AND BENEFITS QUESTION RIGHT AND THEN THERE'S I ASSUME THERE'S MORE BECAUSETHERE'S ALL THIS CONTEST. THE CPS SERVICES RIGHT BECAUSE ALL I PROFESSIONALS CC NPS SERVICES. IS. SO. I HAVE A TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET -- THAT. I CAN WALK YOU THROUGH THAT OR YOU MAY WANT TO VIEW IT YEAH SO SO SO SO I GUESS I GUESS THE COURT I AM SURE YET PAD FOR APPS WITHOUT GAIN. TOO MUCH INTO THE WEEDS BECAUSE OF OF IS IS THAT. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THE FIXED COSTS RELATED TO CENTURY THIS THE CONSOLIDATED PROFESSIONAL SERVICES STRAIGHT. PORTION OF THE BUDGET RIGHT AND THAT PARTS GROWING CORRECT BECAUSE THE RED CAR. AND SO I GUESS WITH. AND I REALIZE THAT THEY ALSO WAS ONE STAFF PERSON. IT IS SO IT SO LICENSE THAT'S AN AVERAGE STEPS -- THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW SOMEONE CALCULATED AND SERVE AVERAGES ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES DEPENDING ON HOW BIG THEY ARTS ADDRESS HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THIS. THIS RATE THE C. AND P. S. RATE FOR FOR THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE IN HOUSE AT CONTRAST WITH SETTING IT. FOR OTHER OTHER AGENCIES AND SO FORTH. SO THIS IS -- A UNIT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES ALL THE CONTRACTED FISCAL UNIT AND THE SMALLER ENTITIES LIKE THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE RIGHT EXPENSIVE THEY CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES AND I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH EXACTLY HOW THOSE RATES ARE SET SO I HAVE TO WORK WITH MY TGS COLLEAGUES ON FINANCE -- BUT THEY HAVE BEEN INCREASING FACTUALLY SPEAKING OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. AND SO THAT THE HAS BEEN A PRESSURE AND THEN JUST THE STAFF PERSON I THINK MAINLY FOCUSES ON JUST DAY TO DAY TASKS AND ALSO THE MODEL LEGISLATIVE SESSION SO I DON'T KNOW IF. IF HE PERSON IS THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE TIME TO ALSO TAKE ON THE ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS IN THE BUDGETARY FUNCTION VIA IN A GOOD AND NOT SO MUCH SAYING THAT THOSE FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE SHIFTED TO THE ONE STAFF PERSON BECAUSE AFTER THEY REQUIRE MULTIPLE SKILL SETS. I GUESS THE QUESTION I'D HAVE AND IT AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND DETAILS CHALLENGE FOR DTS KISSER THE TO TO ASSESS EACH INDIVIDUAL SMALL AGENCY AND SEE WHAT I MEAN LEGAL SERVICES DOES THAT AGENCY REALLY NEEDS I'M JUST THINKING LIKE. THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES ENGAGE IN OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED SOME BASIC A COUNTY YOU NEED SOME BASICALLY YOU'LL SERVICES BUT I MEAN ARE THEY IN A POSITION WHERE THEY GET SUED ALIVE -- THE A LOT OF LEGAL SERVICES IT'S ADDRESS I'M JUST AND AND AND I IT CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT DEL AT THAT THAT'S WORK FOR D. G. S. M. INTERNET THEY MAY NOT WHAT IT MAY BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO GO THROUGH AGENCY BY AGENCY AGENCY TO FIGURE OUT WHILE. THEY MAY VARY FROM ONE THE ONE SO THEY JUST SAY OKAY WELL THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS IS THE POOL WE SPEND WE JUST DIVVIED UP. FOUND SOME PROPORTION BASED ON HOW BIG THEY ARE BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THERE'S SOME WAY. TO GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE WORK THEY DO TO GET. TO DEAL WITH THE C. AND P. S. A LOT OF THE SERVICING ITSELF. NOW THE ACCOUNT AND A LAWYER AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT AT SO I KNOW THERE'S SOME. WAY WE COULD WORK WITH THAT OR NOT WELL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE MAJORITY OF EXPENSES UNDER ACCOUNTING AND SO FOR EXAMPLE ALL THE MEMBERS WHEN THEY FLY OKAY SO THAT'S ALL THEY DO ALL THE REIMBURSEMENTS AND IT'S I THINK THAT'S THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK LOAD BUT THE SPECIFIC. CALCULATIONS AT TGS YOU CHARGE I'M NOT PERSONALLY FAMILIAR WITH. AND DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY OPPORTUNITIES. TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND I REALIZE THIS VERY CONVERSATION WITH THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE MEMBERS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAYS. TO ADDRESS OF THIS COSTS IN A WAY THAT MIGHT REDUCE THE COUNTY OVERHEAD LIKE I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I I I I I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU HOW TO RUN YOUR ORGANIZATION BUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE OKAY WE JUST DO PER DIEM IS WE DON'T DO REIMBURSEMENT. SO THEREFORE IT'S IT OUT WITHOUT HAVING TO GO PROJECT REVIEW ALL THESE RECEIPTS AND SO FORTH I HAVE NO IDEA SO. I THINK THAT THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE WE WE RUN INTO WITH THIS IS THAT I MEAN THEY'RE STILL WALK. RIGHT RIGHT SO SO TO THE EXTENT. WE YOU KNOW IF IF IF THIS THE THE CFS WASN'T YOU KNOW SERVICES WEREN'T CHARGED. TO THE AGENCIES THAT UTILIZE THOSE SERVICES SO AS A RIGHT SO SO IT'S REALLY JUST YOU KNOW YOU'RE TAKING FROM ONE IN BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO. PUT THE MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE SO IT IT BECOMES AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE YOU KNOW. CELLS DEFINITELY NOT THE ONLY AGENCY THEY ARE SMALL -- AGENCY BUT WE WE CAN LOOK INTO HOW THE DETERMINATION IS MADE WHAT THOSE CFOS. ARE HOW THOSE COSTS ARE ALLOCATED AMONGST THE TO AGENCIES THAT USE THOSE SERVICES. I WILL GO OUT ON A LIMB AND SAY I'M I'M PRETTY CERTAIN IT'S THERE'S LIKE. A IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE AMOUNT OF OF WORKLOAD THAT -- THAT TGS TAKES ON BUT WE CAN GET YOU SOME -- SOME MORE INFORMATION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW THAT WORKS UNFORTUNATELY -- YEAH WE WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO OUR D. G. S. CAR DOT COM PARTS AT FINANCE OKAY WELL IN IN WE'VE BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD WE WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH. THE ORGANIZATIONS TERMS HOW THE CALCULATION. IS AND WHETHER THERE ARE ADJUSTMENTS IN. MY POINT IS. THAT IT SEEMS LIKE [inaudible] IT'S JUST. EACH YEAR SOMETHING ELSE COMES UP SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS YEAR. OF CYBER AUDITS HAVE NOW BECOME A PART OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE COST SO HERE WE HAVE. ONE ONE OUR DESKTOP COMPUTER. A ROUTER. AIR AND WE'RE INVOLVED IN A MAJOR. CYBER ON IT THAT'S GOING TO NOW BE OCCURRING EVERY. TWO AND FOUR YEARS. AT A COST IT'S CLEARLY GOING. TO BE THE SIX FIGURE. CATEGORY ARE SO. EVEN IF I WAS THE GREATEST PROMOTER. I PT BARNUM AND I WAS ABLE TO GENERATE MASSIVE INCREASES IN TAX CHECK OFF I CAN'T STAY AHEAD OF THE CONSTANT INCREASES THAT OCCUR -- AS A RESULT OF NEW PROGRAMS THAT INTRODUCED OR SOMEBODY DISCOVERS WHAT THEIR CSL WHERE YOU BEEN ALL THESE YEARS IN TERMS OF FAR CYBERSECURITY SO I I I'M NOT SURE I MISTER CHAIR I'M EVER GOING TO GET A HEAD OF IT AND THEN THE CHALLENGES IS ALSO. AS THE TAX LAWS CHANGE WHAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING TO THE TAX CHECKOFF PROGRAM AND THAT KIND OF THING AS WELL SO I'M CONSTANTLY -- AWAKE WITH WITH NEW CHALLENGES IT SEEMS. OKAY WELL -- YEAH I THINK I THINK THE OTHER PART I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS PART -- AS WELL AS IT IS PART OF ITS LIKE YOU KNOW -- I KNOW AND WE'RE GONNA GET IT'S A VERY QUICKLY TO YEAR -- PROPOSAL FOR INVESTMENT BUT SOME DOUBT THIS SO IT'S GOING TO ASK AND RIGHT NOW. EVENTUALLY IN SPECIALLY IF THE CLINIC IF THE COUNTY TURNS DOWN THE FUTURE LIKE OKAY WELL YOU HOW HOW HOCKEY RAISE MONEY TO SUPPORT YOURSELF THIS IS THAT THE PEOPLE SEE VALUE IN THE STATE NEED TO BE. IT SAID THERE MEMBERS A SENIOR LEGISLATURE. FUNDRAISING EIGHT ON AND HOW THE HOW THE MEMBERS ARE ENGAGED IN AND THEN SOME OF THAT THE TIES OF STANDARDIZATION AND ALSO -- FOR FRANKLY -- WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO BE. PART OF THE STATE WITH THE KIND OF STATE OVERHEAD DOORS IT MAKE MORE SENSE. TO BE LIKE CREATE A SEPARATE NONPROFIT AND PEOPLE CAN GIVE AND GET RIGHT OFTEN MAYBE YOU GET A LITTLE STATE SUBSIDY BUT THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SEE TO READ THAT MEANS YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE ON THIS TASK YOURSELF AND CONTRACT WITH WHOEVER YOU KNOW. ACCOUNTANTS AND LAWYERS CITY NECESSARY BUT DEBT WHETHER THAT'S A A OF CHEAPER COST STRUCTURE YEAR CYBERSECURITY WILL BE THAT. WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK INSTEAD OF HAVING YOU KNOW THE REPORT STATES STATE OF COURSE US DO SOMETHING ACROSS THE BOARD SO. I JUST NOT PROPOSING YOU DO THAT RIGHT NOW I'M JUST THROWING THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A CHRONIC ISSUE THAT COMES UP. NOW EVERY YEAR EVERY TIME WE SO THAT ALLOWS ME TO SEGUE TO THE NICELY YES THAT'S SOMETHING I AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE. TWO BILLS OF INVESTMENT YES. TO THE REQUEST FOR A CONTINUOUS FUNDING -- THE THREE YEAR PLAN NOT ONLY IDENTIFY THE CHALLENGES FACING CSL AND OUTLINED A SOLUTION AS WELL. IT INVOLVED A TWO PRONGED FUNDED APPROACH THAT INVOLVED FUNDING OF THE ADVOCACY EFFORTS AND WE REFER TO IT AS ADVOCACY NOT LOBBYING. K. ARE LOBBYING REQUIRES REGISTRATION ALL THAT KIND OF EFFORT -- AND IT CAN FOR TAX PURPOSES IF WE WERE A NON PROFIT -- WE'D BE IN A DIFFERENT CATEGORY. AS WELL SO ANYWAY. AND ALSO THEN FUNDING COSTS INVOLVING ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE AGENCY. USING GENERAL FUND THIS. SO YOU HAVE A TWO TIERED FUNDING PROGRAMMING YOU'VE BASICALLY. FIRE WALL IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THE OF THE MINISTRY OF PEACE AND THE AND THE ADVOCACY PIECE. OF THE REQUEST FOR AN ONGOING APPROPRIATIONS FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT JUMPED FROM OUR PREVIOUS YEAR BUDGET IS TO TRIP IT MAINLY. TO THE CYBER AUDIT EXPENSE. AND AS OUR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET NOTES 76% OF OUR COSTS. INVOLVED SOVEREIGN BENEFITS STATE FEES. AND CITY T. AUDIT EXPERTS. AS A FIRM REMINDER. THE SALARY AND BENEFITS INVOLVED. A STATE EMPLOYEE BEING ASKED TO THEIR SALARY BENEFITS TO BE FUNDED OUT OF DONATIONS. IN MY MIND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT. OKAY -- THE PROBABLY THE SAVING GRACE AT THIS POINT IS THAT AN EMPLOYEE IS NOT A UNION. PERSON THERE ARE MANAGEMENT. INDIVIDUAL SO BUT STILL THE QUESTION IN MY MIND IS AND I THINK A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ASK HOW DO YOU FUND. A STATE EMPLOYEE OUT OF DONATIONS [inaudible] OUR SO [inaudible] IN CLOSING.

THANK YOU ARE GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS VALERIE SMITH I MAY -- PROGRAM MANAGER WITH ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY CALIFORNIA. AND I'M SCARLET HUGHES I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION. OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS PUBLIC GUARDIANS IN PUBLIC CONSERVATORS. DO I PRESENT A PROPOSAL AND OKAY. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT TO CONTINUE TO GROW THE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR A PS SOCIAL WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR GUARDIAN CONSERVATORS. OUR BROAD COALITION IS REQUESTING FIVE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS OVER THREE YEARS. THIS WORKS OUT TO BE JUST UNDER TWO MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. BUT IT LEVERAGES ANOTHER FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION IN FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR A TOTAL INVESTMENT OF TEN POINT TWO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. UNTIL THREE YEARS AGO THE APS TRAINING PROGRAM WAS SUPPORTED BY A MERE EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN STATE FUNDS. THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH TO MEET -- NOT ONLY MY OWN STAFF TRAINING NEEDS -- LET ALONE ALL THE NEEDS OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY APS WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE. THERE WAS NO CON -- SKEWS ME THERE IS NO TRAINING TO ONBOARD NEW SOCIAL WORKERS OR NEW SUPERVISORS. AND NO ADVANCE TRAINING TO ADDRESS THE VERY COMPLEX AND DIVERSE TYPES OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT THAT WE RESPOND TO ON A DAILY BASIS. WITH THE ONE TIME THREE MILLION APS TRAINING INVESTMENT WHICH GREW TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE FEDERAL MATCH OVER THESE PAST THREE YEARS. WE WERE ABLE TO TRAINER SOCIAL WORK STAFF TO BETTER PROTECT OLDER ADULTS. AND VICTIMS OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT LADIES. FOR EXAMPLE MY STAFF NOW HAVE INCREASED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO CONDUCT INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS ASSIST CLIENTS. FOR DECISION MAKING CAPACITY COMPLETE FINANCIAL ABUSE INVESTIGATIONS ANSWER VICTIMS WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE NEEDS. WE BELIEVE THE TRAINING IS CRITICAL TO PREPARING OUR APS WORK FORCE TO PROTECT AND SERVE OLDER ADULTS AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES. AS DEMAND FOR SERVICES CONTINUE TO RISE WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. OUR ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR GUARDING THINK CONSERVATIVES IN THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND WE'RE THE CERTIFYING BODY LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACCREDITATION. OUR MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURTS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST IMPAIRED ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE IS STATES. I TOO AM REQUESTING YOUR SUPPORT TO CONTINUE THESE FUNDS PRIOR TO THREE YEARS AGO OUR MEMBERS NEVER RECEIVED ANY TYPES OF TRAINING FUNDS EVEN THOUGH CERTIFICATION IS LEGALLY MANDATED FOR THEM. TRAINING WAS LIMITED TO ONE THREE AND A HALF DAY CONFERENCE HE YEAR AND MANY MEMBERS COULD NOT AFFORD TO ATTEND REGULARLY. THE TRAINING FUNDS ALLOWED US TO DELIVER THIRTY ADDITIONAL TRAININGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND PROVIDED OUR MEMBERS WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATION HOURS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVING THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISE. AND REALLY DIFFICULT CASES OUR MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED TO TAKE OVER THE PERSONAL DECISION MAKING OF OUR CLIENTS WHOSE RIGHTS. FOR TO SELF DETERMINATION HAVE BEEN REMOVED BY THE COURTS. AS A RESULT OUR MEMBERS MUST BE TRAINED IN A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE. INCLUDING DECISIONS CONCERNING CEMENT MEDICATION END OF LIFE DECISIONS AND OUR MEMBERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING CLIENTS PERSONAL INCOME AND ALL OF THEIR FINANCIAL AFFAIRS. THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH ANY COMMENTS OR THOUGHTS FROM THE AGENCY ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. NOW OKAY LA -- ANY. FINANCE.

AND IN YOUR POWER POINT IT COVERS ALL THE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND AS RIGHT IT'S DESERVE PROPOSAL TO CONTINUING OF THAT TRAINING OR NOT. THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THIS IS EXACTLY THE TIME SAYS. I GUESS THAT'S ON POSING THE QUESTION IS ARE LIKE WELL THE I MEAN IT WAS USEFUL I MEAN I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT EIGHT THIS IS WONDERFUL RIGHT NOW LIKE WELL THEN WE I'D ASSUME THAT WE'RE STILL HAVING YOU SOCIAL WORKERS RIGHT. YEAH OKAY SO SO IS I I REALIZE THAT IT'S IT'S NOT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YOU CAN'T SAY YEAH I'M FOR IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I DISLIKE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAD A TRAINING PROGRAM IT WAS VERY. SUCCESSFUL RIGHT. PEOPLE SAID IT WAS GOOD RIGHT THAT THE DEPARTMENT FELT WAS USEFUL RIGHT. OKAY THAT'S GOOD SO SO WE SHOULD GIVE CONSIDERATION TO CONTINUING IT PERHAPS OKAY. BECAUSE THERE'S NO PROPOSAL TO CONTINUE IT CORRECT AT THE MOMENT OKAY ALL RIGHT. YOUR COMMENT ON THAT. JUST GOING TO POINT OUT YOU MIGHT HAVE AN INFO GRAPHIC PRINTS THAT TAUGHT US ABOUT SOME OF THE TRAININGS -- WITH THE THREE MILLION IN -- TRAINING FUNDS THAT WE HAD WE ARE ABLE TO DO BOTH ONLINE AND IN PERSON TRAININGS -- AND THE THE ONLINE HELPFUL BECAUSE IT REDUCE THE TRAVEL EXPENSES FOR PEOPLE SO -- AT WE ALSO -- WERE ABLE TO CREATE A CORE CURRICULUM THAT MEANT CRITERIA -- FOR NATIONAL ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES CERTIFICATE -- AND THOSE TRAININGS WERE -- THAT NEEDED IN ORDER TO MEET THAT CRITERIA AND SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO CERTIFY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE A PAST WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE -- SINCE THOSE FUNDS OKAY ALL RIGHT. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL THE AND DO YOU DEBT AT AND HOW MANY I MEAN GIVEN.

IT'S HARD TO SAY BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED EVERY COUNTY IS DIFFERENT HOWEVER -- WE HAVE THE NUMBER THAT THERE'S APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY APS SOCIAL WORKER OR WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE. SO IF ONLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE WERE ACTUALLY MEANT THE DID ALL THE COURSE CURRICULUM FOR THE CERTIFICATION YOU CAN SEE THAT -- OTHER WORKERS MAY HAVE DONE.

CAROL SCHOOL REPRESENTING THE TO CO SPONSOR ORGANIZATIONS THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING AND THE CALIFORNIA ELDER JUSTICE COALITION -- A FACTOR THAT IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT FUNDING A PS IS THAT MANY OF THE SOCIAL WORKERS WHOSE STAFF FOR THESE PROGRAMS.

SO MANY PEOPLE DON'T AND THEY FALL INTO THAT FIELD LATER. MAYBE GOING FROM CHILD% PROTECTIVE SERVICES INTO A PS LATER THIS TRAINING IS CRITICAL BECAUSE WORKING WITH THE ELDERLY AND WORKING WITH AUTONOMOUS POPULATIONS. WHO HAVE A CHOICE AND WHO HAVE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS IS A VERY DIFFERENT THING -- ADDITIONALLY THE FACT THAT -- APS ALSO DEALS WITH AND FINANCIAL CRIMES CHANGE AND EVOLVE DALY.

HARD TO STAND UP TO BRAND NEW PROGRAMS TO AUTOMATE THEM AS ETCETERA -- AND AS WE JUST HEARD BRIEFLY WE KNOW THAT JUST THE ON THE CALPERS SIDE THE ENROLLMENT GOALS ARE ARE ARE YOU KNOW I NEVER MAGNITUDE LIKE WE'VE WE'VE REALLY SEEN RIGHT WE'VE NEARLY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAM AND THE COOL CENTRAL BETWEEN OR SEVENTY THOUSAND AND SO WE KNOW. THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO GET THERE -- AND SO WE FIND SOME SOME QUESTIONS AND AND LIKE SOME POTENTIAL CONCERNS FOR YOU -- SIMILAR TO THE THE LA -- I MEAN YOU CAN SEE IN OUR LETTER THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE STATE OF MONITORING METRICS AND ALSO LOOKING AT SOME OF THE PARTICULAR BARRIERS AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM SOME PEOPLE WHO CAN SPEAK TO BETTER THAN I CAN. I WANNA GET TO PUBLIC COMMENT BUT CERTAINLY ISSUES ARE LANGUAGE ACCESS THAT IS THAT IN THE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW BUT WITH SENIORS PEOPLE DISABILITIES PEOPLE EXPERIENCING POVERTY PEOPLE POTENTIALLY HAD SOME CHALLENGES WITH THE SS I BENEFITS. THAT'S ALL GONNA COME INTO PLAY -- AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THAT THEY THE COUNTY SINCE YOU'RE LOOKING TO DO BUT THERE'S GONNA BE A ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REMAIN ENGAGED TO COMMIT TO STEP IN HAVE OVERSIGHT AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STEP UP AND FIX THINGS AS AS THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] IT'S OKAY ON HOLD HARMLESS AND THANK YOU TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CAUSES FROM LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WAS PROTECTING FAMILIES FROM LOSING CAL FRESH WHEN. THE SS I RECIPIENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD -- WERE PLEASE AT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET INCLUDES A COMMITMENT TO MAKE PROTECTING THESE FAMILIES PERMANENT. AND WE'RE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATUTE. THAT WOULD MAKE THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION BENEFIT AND TRANSITIONAL NUTRITION BENEFIT PERMANENT. BUT PROGRAMS PERMANENT -- AND IN LIGHT OF THE GOVERNOR'S KIND OF INTENTION TO MAKE THOSE PROGRAMS PERMANENT AND TO ADDRESS SOME ISSUES -- THAT WERE NOT LIKE FULLY VETTED IN THE CLICK CLICK OF DRAFTING OF THE LANGUAGE LAST YEAR. WE'RE ASKING FOR SOME ADJUSTMENTS. TO TO MODIFY RULES RELATED TO EXIST FOR THE TO PROGRAM SO THAT BOTH PROGRAM PROGRAMS USE THE ROLE THAT'S CURRENTLY IN PLACE FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION BENEFIT -- TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO RESTORE THE BENEFIT IT WAS TERMINATED FOR REASONS OTHER THAN MISSING EVERY DISCRIMINATION. AND ARE DEADLINE AND ALSO TO ALLOW FOR PROSPECTIVE ENROLLMENT -- AND FINALLY WE'RE PLEASED THAT THE LEGISLATURE ELIMINATED THE OF THE TEN DOLLAR GAP BETWEEN THE CAPPY BENEFIT AND THIS IS I GUESS IS P. BENEFIT -- HOWEVER WERE ASKING THAT THE SECTION THAT MAKES THE INCREASE IN THE CAP THE BENEFIT SUBJECT TO A BUDGET APPROPRIATION BE STRICKEN. THANKS MEGA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK MECCA WITH THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE -- SEATED READING A AND ARE COUNTIES BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE SS AND MANY ADVOCATE PARTNERS LIKE THE FOOD BANKS ASSOCIATION IN THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- THE PARTNERSHIP IS SPEND BAND TASTIC IN THE STATE'S LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN REALLY TOP RATE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP OF ALL THOSE ORGANIZATIONS. ALSO WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEM SO THAT WE HAVE AUTOMATION IN PLACE -- BY JUNE ONE TO IMPLEMENT THE BENEFIT WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT SO FAR THAT IMPLEMENTATION IS GOING WELL. AND THAT WE'VE ENCOUNTERED NO MAJOR PROBLEMS ARE BARRIERS. AND THE CURRENTLY WORK GROUPS DISCUSSING HOW READ -- IT'S CLEAR THAT THE STATE IS GOING TO BROADLY REACH OUT TO ANY -- POTENTIAL -- BENEFICIARY AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A SMART APPROACH THE BROUGHT OUT REACH -- IS IT IS GREAT FOR MOWING SSI RECIPIENTS IT ALSO SORT OF LEADS TO BASICALLY ARE SORT OF MOST SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. AND THAT IS -- MISS MCCOY WAIT INDICATED IS JUST VOLUME -- WE LEARNED MANY LESSONS FROM IMPLEMENTING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT -- SOME OF WHICH WE'VE ANTICIPATED THAT WON'T HAPPEN -- AUTOMATION IS IN PLACE THE STATE RULES HAVE BEEN CLEAR AND HAVE COME TO US WITH SUFFICIENT LEAD TIME -- BUT WE ALSO REALIZE FROM THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A VOLUME THAT FAR EXCEEDS WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE -- IT CAN BE REALLY DIFFICULT FOR CLIENTS AND IN THIS CASE OR SOME OF THE MOST WONDERFUL PEOPLE IN THE AND SOCIETY. THAT LEADS -- TO A CW WE'RE REQUESTING FIFTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND WHICH IS AND SORT OF TWO COMPONENTS. THE FIRST IS FIVE POINT THREE MILLION ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR APPLICATION VOLUME. THE BUDGET INCLUDES FUNDING FOR NEW CASES. THE BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE FUNDING -- FOR THE ESTIMATED THREE HUNDRED AND TWELVE FOR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY CASES -- WE EXPECT THE VOLUME OF APPLICANTS WILL BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT COULD BE TRIPLE -- AND WE ARE REQUESTING ONE TIME FUNDING SO WE CAN PROCESSES APPLICATIONS AND WE DON'T HAVE VERY VULNERABLE PEOPLE WAITING LONG PERIODS OF TIME MORE HAVING LONG LINES. OUT OUT THE DOOR OF THE WELFARE OFFICE. THE SECOND PART OF THE REQUEST IS TEN POINT ONE MILLION FOR ONGOING FUNDING. THE STATE IN THE COUNTIES DID AGREE LAST YEAR TO AN ASSUMPTION ABOUT WORKLOAD FOR THE NEW CASES. THEIR NEW WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE BUT FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE WE CAME TO A A GOOD. A GOOD UNDERSTANDING -- THE BUDGET HOWEVER FUNDS THAT WORKLOAD AT TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE COSTS. SO THAT THE UNIT COST THE COST OF THE WORKER THE COST OF THE BUILDING THE OVER HAD. IN THE CALPERS PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE AND SO INFLATION AND HAS PROBABLY ERODED MAYBE 40% OF THAT SO THE BUDGET ACTUALLY ONLY FUND 60% OF THE WORK THAT WE AGREED. COUNTIES NEED TO DO AND AND THAT'S A VAST SESSION ERA. A YOU KNOW A BY GONE ERA OF HOW THE STATE MANAGED ITS BUDGET IN A KIND OF A STATE COUNTY -- ENGAGEMENT IT REALLY DOESN'T REFLECT WHERE WE ALL ARE IN TERMS OF PARTNERSHIP. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO GET THIS THIS IMPLEMENTED AND SO WE'D REQUEST THAT THE ADMINISTRATION UPDATE THE UNIT COST. TO CURRENT COST SINCE IT IS INCONTROVERTIBLE A NOT TOO THOUSAND TODAY. RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ANY COMMENTS FROM AGENCY ABOUT WHAT SAID BEEN PRESENTED [inaudible] OKAY ALEJO [inaudible] FINANCE -- WORDS PER MINUTE FINANCE I THINK WE WOULD JUST SAY FOR A COUPLE OF THESE ISSUES WERE OBVIOUSLY WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THE LEGISLATURE THE EXTENT THESE BECOME PRIORITIES -- AND WE'RE OPEN ONGOING DISCUSSION HOWEVER NOW THESE WERE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OKAY BUT I WOULD PRESUME THOUGH THAT IMPLEMENTING CASH OUT IS A PRIORITY OF THE BUDGET RIGHT BECAUSE IT DOES. SO THAT. THE SUGGESTION IS IF IT'S IF IT'S A NICE THING THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO DO. THAT ENTERTAIN THE CONVERSATION BUT OTHERWISE NOT THAT WOULD NOT SEEM CONSISTENT. WITH THAT THE PARTNERSHIP AROUND A PROPOSAL THAT IS CURRENT LAW. THE CURRENT FINANCED HER WORDS I THINK WE WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE THAT WE WANT THIS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AND SMOOTH AND SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION AND THAT'S WHY WE'D BE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN FURTHER CONVERSATION. ALL RIGHT A FREE **** MAY V. CAN LOOK AT THE THE FINDINGS BASED ON OLD NUMBERS MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT THE WEATHER WE HAVE MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION. TO BETTER DISHER THAT. THANK COUNTY PARTNERS THE HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL CENSORED THE SIR THE OPERATIONAL AND OF THIS RIGHT OKAY. RIGHT OF A CERTIFIED THIS ONE IS THE THIS IS MY THANK EVERYONE AND WHO HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS -- THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR A VERY LONG TIME I HEARD FOR ME MY COLLEAGUES AND LEGISLATURE WHY ARE WE NOT DOING THIS RIGHT AND IT AND I THINK LAST YEAR I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AND THE FACT THAT. CENTER FOR US -- Là PROPERTIES AT OKAY THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO WE JUST HAVEN'T DONE IT AND WE HAVEN'T DONE IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME LIKE WELL WHY CAN'T WE DO IT. RIGHT AND THAT WE WERE ABLE. TO COME TOGETHER I KNOW THERE IS -- YOU KNOW TURN THAT THE END OF WORKING OUT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ROLLING PEOPLE INTO CAL FRESH IT'S ALSO ABOUT DOING THE HOLD HARMLESS PIECE WHICH IS. COMPLICATED A THEY THINK YOU KNOW YOU THE TRICKERY THAT PIECE OUT AND SO FORTH AND SO AND I'M GLAD WE WERE ABLE TO COME TO AGREEMENT GET IN THE BUDGET AND LIVE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS LAUNCHING ON ON JUNE FIRST AND BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE. THAT -- HOPEFULLY -- IT WE ALWAYS AT THE LOOKS LIKE WE'RE IN THE NEXT RECESSION MIGHT HIT WE ONLY PUT IN VARIOUS BUFFERS BETWEEN RAINY DAY FUND AND AND SO FORTH BUT ALSO THAT. HOPEFULLY THE CALPERS BENEFIT ITSELF IS ONE THAT WILL BE ITSELF -- POLICE A SMALL BUT BUT IMPORTANT BUFFER -- TO STRESSES THAT HAPPEN ON THE STATE BUDGET AS WELL THE FACT THAT WE NOW CAN GET PEOPLE ON CAL FRESH'S. SO GIVEN THE VOLATILITY OF STATE FUNDING REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK -- EVERYONE IS DONE ON AND LOOKING FOR TO BOTH THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH ON JUNE FIRST -- BUT ALSO THE FOLLOW THROUGH RIGHT AND AND AND I APPRECIATE THAT WERE LIKE THE CA RIGHT WE'RE GOING. TO THE CIVIC VOLUME WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE MOVING PEOPLE INTO A CELL [inaudible] RIGHT.

THINGS TO SAY IN JUNE BUT IN TERMS OF ACTUAL STATEWIDE DATA WILL BE A MONTH IN AND THEN EVEN THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO SORT OUT -- BUT WE YOU KNOW ANYTIME WE CAN -- POSTER WISHING PUBLICLY ON A MONTHLY AND QUARTERLY BASIS AND THEN OF COURSE HAPPY TO DO MORE BRIEFINGS FOR THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF ANY TIME OKAY SO PLEASE GIVE BERNIE TO SOMETHING TO DO AFTER TO BUDGETS. OKAY SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT HOW HOW THIS ALL OF THIS NOW THIS RULES OUT AND LET'S SEE A WILL FIGURE OUT FOR MAY HELP YOU SURE PEOPLE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE WE DO THIS SUCCESSFULLY SO BASED ON MORE CURRENT. NUMBERS CELL THAN WAS AT NINETY ONE AND WHICH WHICH YEAR WAS THAT. THROUGHOUT. TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE ALL RIGHT OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT. OKAY SO -- SHE WAS REPEAT CPO. OKAY THEY MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THAT RIGHT OKAY SO JUST TO CONFIRM -- SINCE THERE'S ALSO PCP PORTION THAT THERE WAS A REQUEST SINCE I KNOW YOU DON'T EXPLICITLY SAY I NOTES INTO WRITTEN MATERIAL -- SO LIVE TURF LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR ELEVEN A HIGHER CASELOAD ALRIGHT THAT'LL NATURE OF THIS CASE LOW THE ELDERLY AND PEOPLE DISABILITIES AND THE NEW STATE PROGRAMS OKAY EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT. OKAY SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE HOUSING THIS BILLY ACSI PROGRAM. OKAY I THINK EVERYONE AROUND THE TABLE STILL THE SAME OKAY ALL RIGHT GOOD ALL RIGHT SO WE'LL. RIGHTS OF MY GO AHEAD AND BEGIN YES SIR ALEX HADN'T CSS OUR HOUSING ASSISTANCE FOR ITS BRANCH -- SO JUST A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION SINCE WE WERE LAST YEAR -- YOUR OVERVIEW DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF IT SO I'LL JUST QUICKLY TOUCHING A FEW PIECES BUT AS A REMINDER THIS IS THE FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR OVER A THREE YEAR -- PROGRAM THAT WAS FUNDING COMING DUE NEXT NEXT YEAR -- THERE IS A THERE IS A COUNTY MATCH -- AND THIRTY NINE COUNTIES ARE ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED TO COUNTIES -- SORT OF ON A ROLLING BASIS BETWEEN NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN JANUARY -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH A SECOND ROUND SORT OF COMPLETING AND ROUNDING OFF THE FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- IN APRIL OF OF LAST YEAR -- SINCE THEN WE HAVE HOSTED AT THREE IN PERSON LEARNING FORUMS YOU'VE BEEN DOING QUITE A FEW WEBINARS OUGHT TO TRY TO GET FOLKS UP TO SPEED ON HOW TO SECURE HOUSING FOR THIS POPULATION THAT HAS BEEN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. HOW TO GO ABOUT BUDGETING IT'S A PRETTY COMPLEX -- PROGRAM AND THEN ENSURING THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING FIRST WHICH WILL BE A REQUIREMENT AS OF JULY OF THIS YEAR -- SO THERE'S I'VE I'VE ALSO GONE OUT AND DONE QUITE A BIT BUT IF SITE VISITS -- UNTIL WE SEE FOLKS YOU KNOW IT IT DID TAKE AT COUNTIES QUITE A BIT OF TIME TO GET ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THIS PROGRAM TOGETHER -- IT'S THAT PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING POPULATION TO SERVE -- TO TRY TO DO OUR REACH FOR A TO MAINTAIN THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH -- IT'S ALSO BEEN A PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING POPULATION TO FIND HOUSING FOR EVEN WITH AN SSI CHECK I THINK SOME COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT MIGHT WORK -- WE ARE JUST IN THE MIDST OF SORT OF SEEING THE DATA THAT YOU ALL SEE -- FROM IS FROM NOVEMBER WE ACTUALLY HAVE HAD UPDATED DATA AS OF JANUARY SEEING ALMOST A DOUBLING DISABILITY BENEFITS APPLICATION SUBMITTED TO US SINCE WE LAST OF THIS THE WERE ALMOST AT SEVEN HUNDRED APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED AS OF JANUARY -- AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT PARTICIPANTS PERMANENTLY HOUSE YOU ARE SEEING THAT GAP BETWEEN -- THOSE -- DISABILITY BENEFIT ABLE TO FIND PERMANENT HOUSING FOR IT THUS FAR -- TO A STOP THERE WAS SORT OF THE OVER VIEW -- I KNOW YOU A COUPLE QUESTIONS ANNA. AGENDA THAT I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS AS WELL AS HELPFUL WHAT WHAT -- WHAT YOU GO AND ANSWER THOSE? QUESTIONS THAT ARE SO YEAH SO I MEAN IN TERMS OF MEASURING THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM ON LIKE A COUPLE OF OUR OTHER -- HOMELESSNESS PROGRAM THIS PROGRAM DOESN'T HAVE AN EVALUATION COMPONENT TIED TO IT SO WE UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE AN EXTERNAL EVALUATOR FOR THIS PROGRAM. THAT SAID WE ARE TRYING TO DO SOME THINGS INTERNALLY -- AS THE PROGRAM GETS UP AND RUNNING AND MAINLY THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS IN THE STATUTE THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE COLLECTED -- THERE'S SOME QUALITATIVE DATA THAT WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN SEEING FROM COUNTIES IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT SORT OF EVEN TEMPORARY HOUSING ON GETTING AS AS OUR WHILE GETTING APPLICATION PUT TOGETHER -- SORT OF HOW THAT HELP THE APPLICATION BE SUBMITTED MORE QUICKLY HOPEFULLY SO THERE'S SOME QUALITATIVE DATA WILL BE GETTING FROM THERE WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH A FEW COUNTIES -- THAT HAVE ACCESS TO THE SOME TO SEE IF DOWN THE ROAD WE CAN TRACK RETURNS TO HOMELESSNESS -- IT IS NOT A DATA SYSTEM THAT WE OWN OUR MOST COUNTIES -- SO IT HAS BEEN A BIT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH THE COUNTY TO TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN GET THERE DOWN THE ROAD BUT THAT -- THAT RETURN TO HOMELESSNESS NUMBERS A BIT TRICKY FOR US TO GET TO BUT WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON IT FOR THIRTEEN COUNTY SORT OF HAVE GOOD ACCESS NOW WE'RE TRYING TO TO BUMP THAT NUMBER UP AS WE GO. AND THAT SORT OF IN TERMS OF SUCCESS -- ALSO LOOKING SORT OF IT AS WE GET FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD AND HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF APPROVAL RATES FOR SS I APPLICATIONS WILL BE LOOKING AT THOSE COMPARED TO OTHER MODELS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE QUITE AS MUCH EIGHT ON THAT YET BECAUSE IT. TAKES A BIT OF TIME TO GET THOSE APPROVED -- AND THEN YOUR LAST QUESTION HERE ON THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WERE EXPECTING THAT TO BE GIVEN A PRETTY SIMILAR WAY THAT WE ALLOCATED THE LAST ROUND THING YOU KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE A MATCH -- IT WILL BE COMPETITIVE WE HAVE SEEN A FEW COUNTIES THAT GOT I LOS UP FIVE LESS FUNDING IN THE FIRST ROUND SORT OF ALREADY SLOWING DOWN. THERE -- THEIR OUR REFERRALS AND AND APPROVAL SO THERE AND WE WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME NAY BUT IT WILL BE GIVEN OUT A PRETTY SIMILAR FASHION AS AS THE FIRST FORTY FIVE MILLION WAS. OKAY THANK YOU -- COMES FROM OHIO. WE'VE REVIEWED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MONEY REYES NO CONCERNS WITH THE CONCEPT OF AGE THAT BEING AN ONGOING PROGRAM WE JUST -- WOULD KNOW JUST SOME GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION OR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AROUND WHEN AGED UP WAS PROPOSES A PILOT PROGRAM THEY WERE SPECIFIC -- DATA -- COMPONENTS THAT WERE OUTLINED BEING THAT IT'S BEEN MORE DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE SOME OF THOSE DATA COMPONENTS THAN OTHERS -- SO WITH THE ONGOING NATURE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL GETTING A BETTER SENSE OF MOVING FORWARD HOW ARE WE CAN IMPROVE THE DATA QUALITY THAT WE'RE GETTING -- FROM COUNTIES TO BETTER ASSESS THE OUTCOMES WITH AN H. TOP ITSELF -- BUT IN ALSO BROADER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE INITIAL FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO UNDERSTANDING THAT -- IN NINETEEN TWENTY THAT WOULD BE THE LAST YEAR IN WHICH THAT FIRST -- INITIAL FUNDING CAN BE SPENT DOWNS GETTING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WILL -- LATER ON ON TOP OF THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCE AS WELL -- BUT HAPPY TO CONTINUE HAVING CONVERSATIONS THE DEPARTMENT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS AN EVOLVING CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW HOW THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. THANK YOU FINANCE [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. UP SO. THE IDEA I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO MEASURE THE RETURN TO HOMELESSNESS A YEAR SO YOU'RE COUNTY AND THESE AT THIRTEEN COUNTIES HAVE SOME. MECHANISM IN PLACE. TO MEASURE THAT I GUESS WHEN IT COMES -- NOW THIS THIRTEEN COUNTIES REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL OF THE STATE OR THE HOURS JUST A THIRTY BIGGEST COUNTIES PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY USUALLY HAVE MORE RESOURCES. I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK ABOUT LIKE WELL. WHEN IT COMES TO DOING EVALUATION -- AND SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NO I'M GOING FUNDING AT MOVING MORE TOWARD THAT AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THIS IS -- YOU KNOW VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM -- THAT -- WE LOOKING AT SOME OTHER OF AND OR EXPANDED CAPACITIES OF COUNTIES THAT THAT DOWN MAYBE PARTNERING OF COUNTIES THAT DO SO THEY CAN NOW LEVERAGE OFF EACH OTHER IN TERMS OF EXISTING SYSTEM SO. HE SPEAK TO WHAT MIGHT BE FUTURE PLANS FOR FEMALE TO BE SURE WE CAN GET THE KIND OF INFORMATION WE NEED TO SHOW THAT WERE -- THAT WILL GAIN CAM RESULTS WERE EXPECTING YEAH SO I I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF THIS IS THERE'S ALSO DISCUSIONS HAPPENING AT THE STATE LEVEL AROUND SORT OF A STATEWIDE DATA WAREHOUSE FOR HOMELESSNESS WHICH IF THAT WERE TO COME. TO PLAY WE'D BE ABLE TO SORT OF MATCH TO THAT DATA SET AND BE ABLE TO SEE THAT SOMETHING IS STATEWIDE LEVEL -- I EXPECT THAT TO BE QUITE A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD THOUGH SO I I MEAN I THINK FOR THE THIRTEEN COUNTIES THAT ARE ARE CURRENTLY. I WOULD SAY ACTIVELY ABLE TO GET DATA OUT OF THE H. I. S. SYSTEM IT'S IT'S A VERY GROUP -- OUR HOPE IS THOUGH THAT JUST FROM A A SYSTEMS OUR COLLABORATION STANDPOINT THAT WE CAN BRING MORE COUNTIES INTO THAT SPACE -- AND IT WOULD IT WOULD TAKE MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ARE OTHER BUT WE'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN OR OTHER -- PROGRAM BRINGING FAMILIES HOME HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT WITH AN EXTERNAL EVALUATOR SORT OF ON THE GROUND HELPING THEM FIGURE OUT. THAT THE DATA PRIVACY PIECES OF OF SOME OF THAT SO THE HOPE WOULD BE THAT -- WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND AND SOME OF AND AND WITH THE ONGOING NATURE THAT THERE'S MORE INCENTIVE TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE LONG TERM IT IN THAT -- MODEL IN THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTH SAYS IT DOESN'T STATUTES. OKAY THE OBVIOUS THING I AT LEAST IN THE BEGINNING IF THERE'S A WAY. TO MAYBE A SAMPLE RIGHT. OF COURSE THIS IS AT THE THIRTEEN MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INTERSTATE BUT THE AND AND THINKING ABOUT LIKE WILDER PARTICULAR COUNTY SO MIGHT BE MORE WILLING THAT THEY HAD SOME ASSISTANCE FROM MY COUNTY THAT THREE DOING YET THEY CAN LEVERAGE OFF THEIR SYSTEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ARE THAT WRITING THEM ASSISTANCE IN THAT REGARD SO FORTUNATELY ALL OF THE HMS SYSTEMS ARE OWNED BY -- SEPARATE ENTITIES ACROSS AND THEY SORT OF HAVE VERY DIFFERENT DATA PRIVACY RULES AND SO WE'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF PEER SHARING OF AT LEAST THIS IS HOW WE WERE ABLE TO GET. ACCESS TO IN OUR COUNTY AND YOU CAN GO AND TALK TO YOUR A TO MY AS CORNY OR IN YOUR COUNTY SOME OF THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING I WOULD SAY THAT WITH THE THIRTEEN THAT WE HAVE WOULD BE ABLE. TO SAY SOMETHING DOWN THE ROAD JUST SORT OF NOTING THOUGH THAT EVEN IF THEY GET THEIR A SOCIETY YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW THEY GET THEIR **** SIDE WE DON'T NECESSARILY ACCEPT THEM RIGHT OFF. AND THEN IT WOULD TAKE A SIX MONTH AT MINIMUM FROM THERE SO EVEN THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIT OF A LAG AND AND EVEN LIVE TIME DATA SO WHILE WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WE HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITY TO TRY. TO GET BETTER ENGAGEMENT INTO THOSE SYSTEMS OKAY ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- SO -- WHAT WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX IS A PROPOSAL FOR INVESTMENT AND -- WE HAVE SOMEONE IS SEE WHO'S PRESENTING CALIFORNIANS FOR SSI. THE REQUESTED -- ACTUALLY IS THAT OKAY FROM WESTERN STAR Là POVERTY YOUR SERVICE IS THE PERFECT WHO IS THE PRESENTER FOR THIS. WELCOME ALL RIGHT SEE LAST TIME WHAT YOU DID LAST YEAR OKAY ALL THE TROUBLE WE CAUSED YES THANK YOU FOR CALLING US OUT ON THAT -- I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- AND I'VE JUST IF I JOB MOMENT PRIVILEGE TO SAID -- THANK THAT APARTMENT IN THE COUNTIES -- FOR THE GREAT WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE OVER THE LAST YEAR ROUND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALPERS EXPANSION. MEAN -- WE ARE REALLY WE'VE BEEN VERY PLEASE WITH THE STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT I THINK FRANKLY IT'S AS GOOD AS I'VE EVER SEEN -- IN IF THEY'VE REALLY WORKED VERY HARD AT THIS AND I'M ANTICIPATING A A REALLY ROBUST RESPONSE IN JUNE IN FACT I WHEN I TALK TO CLIENTS MAY NAY. THE CAN'T WAIT MORE THAT WILL BE OVERWHELMED. AND WE'RE GONNA E UNDER ALL SO -- THAT'S A GOOD THING AND HOPEFULLY THAT'S A PROBLEM WE CAN MANAGE AND WE WILL AS WE GO FORWARD BUT I JUST DID WANT. TO SAY THAT ON THE RECORD THAT OF THE ASTOUNDING JOBS OUTSTANDING JOB THAT THEY HAVE DONE. ON THIS WORK ON THE SEPARATE SO -- SO -- I'M HERE TODAY THOUGH ACTUALLY TO PRESENT ON AND A SEPARATE ISSUE BUT RELATED WHICH IS THE THAT'S THE ESSENCE I GRANT LEVELS -- AND I WAS LISTENING EARLIER IN THE DAY OUT -- SENATOR STONE -- HAD MADE A COMMENT ABOUT SORT OF THE STATE OF BE YOU KNOW OF EVEN SOME SECURITY CHECK CAN'T LIVE -- OUT OF OUTSIDE OF POVERTY ANYMORE IN OUR STATE THAT COSTS OF RIBBONS RISEN SO QUICKLY -- THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO THAT WELL WE HAVE -- ROUGHLY WE HAVE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF OVER SIXTY FIVE SS I RECIPIENTS OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY SO AS CENTER STONE WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS JUST STRUCK ME THAT. EVERYTHING HE'S DESCRIBING APPLIES TO THAT AS THE SITE POPULATION BUT EVEN MORE BECAUSE THEIR MAXIMUM GRANT IS NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH. SO PEOPLE WHO ARE ON SOCIAL SECURITY ARE GETTING OLD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT ABOVE THAT I'M STILL NOT ADEQUATE I COMPLETELY GROUP CENTER STONE ON THAT POINT -- BUT I I THINK IT AGAIN BEARS REPEATING THAT WE STILL HAVE CUTS IN PLACE THAT WE TOOK -- DURING THE TIME OF GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER -- THAT REDUCE THE STATE'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE GRANT TO THE POINT WERE WERE ONLY I THINK FOUR DOLLARS ABOVE THE ABSOLUTE. BOTTOM THAT WE CAN PROVIDE UNDER FEDERAL LAW HUNDRED SIXTY DOLLARS A MONTH THE MINIMUM IS -- ONE FIFTY SIX AND SO AGAIN AS EACH YEAR THAT WE GO ALONG WE SEE THAT. THE POVERTY LEVEL FOR THAT CREATES -- AGAIN WE DROPPED OVER A MILLION PEOPLE TIME THAT WAS OUR ACTS THAT WE DID HERE AND THAT NUMBER KEEPS GOING DOWN I THINK WE'RE DOWN TO ABOUT 90% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL NOW -- NOW IT WAS GREAT THAT WE ARE DOING THE CALPERS EXPANSION AND THAT'S GOING TO HELP A LOT OF FOLKS. BUT WHEN YOU DO THE MATH AND EVEN IF WERE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL LET'S SAY WE GOT A HALF OF HALF A MILLION AS A SLIGHT RECIPIENTS IN ROLLED AND CAL FOR US. THAT WOULD STILL LEAVE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES WHO DO NOT BENEFIT FROM THE CALPERS EXPANSION MEANING THAT THEY AREN'T GOING TO BE GETTING ANY INCREASE IN THEIR BENEFIT AT ALL. IT'S A WIN FOR THE TNTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING OVER A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ANNUALLY FROM THAT POPULATION. NOT PROVIDING IT TO THEM AND I'M WOULD SUGGEST THAT OVER TIME THIS IS HAVING TO MAKE-SIGNIFICANT DETRIMENTAL EFFECT. ON THE THE PEOPLE ON THE US ASIDE IN THE US AYE CASELOAD -- I THINK WE'RE SEEM HIGHER LEVELS OF HOMELESSNESS -- HIGHER LEVELS OF ILLNESS. PEOPLE ARE REALLY REALLY STRUGGLING TO GET BY AND SO WE ARE BACK AGAIN ASKING. FOR AUGMENTATIONS TO THE BUDGET THAT WOULD MAKE. SURE THAT THE GRANT LEVELS FOR SSI RECIPIENTS HITS THE 1100% LEVEL OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL NOW WE DON'T THINK THAT'S A PANACEA WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY EVEN COMPLETELY ADEQUATE. BUT WE THINK IS A STARTING POINT FOR THE LEDGE -- INTO WE'VE COME FORTH AND SUGGESTED THAT WE DO THIS OVER. A COUPLE BUDGETS I THINK WE WOULD STILL BE OPEN TO APPROACH LIKE THAT AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THE TIME WILL COME THIS YEAR WHERE WE CAN PUT THAT PLAN IN EFFECT AND GET IT DONE. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR TIME MY TIME OKAY THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH ANY COMMENTS FROM THE FORCES OF SOCIAL SERVICES. ALL RIGHT LA -- OF FINANCE [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY WELL.

ACCURACY -- ELIA JEANNIE BELL LA O.. K. FINANCE CUT OFF TO THE JOB HERE ALL RIGHT WELCOME ALL RIGHT SO -- WHEN WE GO AHEAD BEGIN WITH THE? AN OVERVIEW OF AYE HSS IN THE END MAINLY ABOUT HITTING VIA THE HIGHLIGHTS WHICH HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD ABOUT I THINK THERE'S SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WE HAD THAT WE WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN AS WELL. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO THE POWER POINT TO STARTS WITH THE BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAM ITSELF -- WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND CURRENT. RECIPIENTS RECEIVING I AGES US -- AS THE ESTIMATED FOR A FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY ARE THE BREAKDOWN OF THAT GIVES YOU BY AGE THEIR SEASON SEE THAT A LITTLE BIT -- THEN WE GO INTO SOME BUDGET INFORMATION FOR YOU. AND THEN SOME INFORMATION AGAIN ABOUT THE GROWTH OF THE PROGRAM AND RECIPIENTS AND PROVIDERS OVER TIME. WE'RE UP TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PROVIDERS AS WELL IN THE PROGRAM. GIVES YOU SOME DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ABOUT BOTH THE RECIPIENT SEVEN AM THE PROVIDERS THAT YOU CAN. TAKE A LOOK AT AND THEN IT GOES INTO GIVING OUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SICK LEAVE BENEFIT. THAT OCCURRED THIS LAST JULY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO OUR EYES HAS PROVIDERS ARE NOW ELIGIBLE. FOR EIGHT HOURS -- ANNUALLY AND THAT WILL GO UP AS THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES. TO SIXTEEN HOURS WHEN MINIMUM WAGES THIRTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR I'M NOT A FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR -- THE ELECTRONIC SERVICES PORTAL I KNOW YOUR LITTLE BIT INTERESTED AND THE ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS SO THAT IS FULLY OPERATIONAL STATEWIDE AND HAS BEEN FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR NOW I THINK. AND WE HAVE A JUST OVER ABOUT ROLES NOW IN THE PORTAL AND USING ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS -- AS A WAY OF SUBMITTING THEIR TIME FOR PAYMENT -- THERE IS ALSO A LITTLE OVER 40% OF PROVIDERS THAT ARE RECEIVING THEIR PAYMENTS THROUGH A DIRECT DEPOSIT -- OFF OPTION. THEN IT GOES INTO OUR ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION -- AND I CAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO COVER YOUR QUESTION NOW AS FAR AS ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION -- AS FAR YEAH UPDATE ON BASS. PLEASE OKAY SO THE REQUIRE THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS TO IMPLEMENT ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION SYSTEM FOR OUR PROVIDERS -- ME BY. JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY WAS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT NOW. FOR A YEAR AND A HALF FOR MORE WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE TO PASS GOING WE HAVE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM ITSELF. AND THEN WE HAVE THE IMPLEMENTATION PATH SO AS FAR AS THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT THERE WILL BE TWO PRIMARY OPTIONS FOR PROVIDERS TO UTILIZE IN. IN DOING ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION EITHER ONLINE OR THROUGH A TELEPHONE SOLUTION. THE ONLINE SOLUTION WE DID AN EXTENSIVE -- OUTSIDE. THE STAKEHOLDER -- LAST FALL WE GOT -- TO VERY POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THE EASE AND SIMPLICITY OF THAT SO THAT PEACE IS. FAIRLY WELL -- COMPLETED THE TELEPHONE SOLUTION WE WILL BE DOING THOSE DEMOS COMING UP NOW IN MARCH AND APRIL. THAT WILL FOCUS PRIMARILY ON WALKING INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THE SCRIPTING PROCESS AND THE PROMISE THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE TO ENTER THAT INFORMATION AND THAT IN A TELEPHONE -- OPTION AND THE DE INTENT AND WE ARE ON TRACK IS TO COMPLETE THOSE BY JULY OF THIS YEAR JULY OF NINETEEN AND HAVE IT READY. TO MOVE INTO A PILOT PHASE AND ROLLOUT OF THAT SYSTEM. ON THE IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION WE ARE WORKING ON MATERIALS FOR OUTREACH AND TRAINING WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEND THOSE OUT TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS THIS MONTH TO START LOOKING AT THOSE AND GIVING US FEEDBACK ON THEM BECAUSE WE WILL ALSO WANT. TO HAVE THEM ALL TRANSLATED ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN. A WE'VE GOTTEN ALL THE APPROPRIATE FEEDBACK AND HAVE THEM READY TO BEGIN USING WITH -- WITH OUR PILOT FOLKS IN JULY -- THAT WE WILL ALSO BE TALKING ABOUT HE STRATEGY FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ROLLING THAT OUT WE HAVE MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS THAT WILL BE COMING UP THE END OF MARCH -- THAT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING PLAN IS TO START IMPLEMENTING IN JULY AND IT WILL BE AN EIGHTEEN MONTH IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD TO BRING US -- TO THE END OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ON THE IN ORDER TO MEET THE FEDERAL TIMELINES WELL THAT'S A YEAR PAST THE DATE. THE STATE DOES INTEND TO APPLY FOR THE ONE YEAR GOOD FAITH EFFORT AT EXCEPTION FROM THE PENALTY FOR ON THAT YEAR PERIOD. AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THAT PROCESS -- IN AND THEN AFTER THE ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION IT ALSO INCLUDES -- INFORMATION ABOUT -- WE WILL BE -- STARTING TO INCLUDE -- SOME ADDITIONAL PROGRAM DATA THAT'S GOING TO BE GOING UP ON OUR WEBSITE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF SHARING THAT WITH OUR COUNTIES BECAUSE IT WILL BE COUNTY LEVEL DATA AS WELL. AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE THAT UP THAT. END OF MARCH BEGINNING OF APRIL. BEFORE WITH THE COMMENTS FROM LA -- IN FINANCE -- JUST THE THE CLERK AND THE SELECT TRONIC TIME SHEETS HAS IF SO I THINK THE LAST. TIME WE TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR WE WERE DOES THAT AT THE FEDERAL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COME UP WITH THERE'S ACTUAL REGULATIONS AROUND THAT. AROUND ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION YES THEY HAVE NOT ISSUED REGULATIONS OKAY NECESSARILY ANTICIPATE THEY'RE GOING. TO DO ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT WITH. OKAY AND TO SOME DEGREE THAT OR FLEXIBILITY AND CHECK TO DO IT AND THE WAY THAT WORKS BEST FOR GOOD. WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE OKAY SO I I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO SOME BACK AND FORTH ABOUT BECAUSE -- SERVICE IN THE ABSENCE OF INFORMATION WE OVERSHOOT RIGHT AND RECOGNIZING THAT. SO I THINK THERE WAS SOME TENSION ABOUT WELL WHAT ARE THE FEDS GOING TO PUT IN REGULATION AND WHAT WE DO AND SO FORTH SO. I JUST WANT TO FIND A WAY THE FEDS WERE ON ON THE ON ON THEIR RULES BUT THAT THEY WOULD BE GOOD IF THEY GIVE US SOME SOME FLEXIBILITY. THAT THEY ARE -- ALLOWING FOR THAT FLEXIBILITY AND ALLOWING US TO WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO DO WHAT OKAY WORK FAST EXCELLENT EXCELLENT AND THEN -- JUST ALSO. DID IT AT THE PROVIDER BACK UP SYSTEM FOR THE PAID SICK LEAVE -- TOBY IDIOT AND STAND THE THE PAID SICKLY WORKGROUP IN A FIRE BACK UP SYSTEM RECOGNIZING THAT. YOU KNOW JUST HOW. HOW THAT HOW IS THAT GOING? SO WHAT WITH SICKLY BEING IMPLEMENTED THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT WOULD BE FOR INDIVIDUALS -- WHEN THEIR PROVIDER WAS OUT SICK AND BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE THEIR CARE SO WE ARE WORKING WITH ABOUT TEN COUNTIES AND PUBLIC AUTHORITIES INCLUDING LA COUNTY WHICH IS ABOUT 40% OF OUR CASELOAD? TO GATHER DATA ABOUT WHAT IS OCCURRING -- AND WHAT KIND OF REQUEST THE COUNTIES ARE GETTING -- FOR BACK UP DUE TO THE SICK LEAVE IMPLEMENTATION AT OUR FIRST MEETING AND FEBRUARY HAD ABOUT A QUARTER ABOUT THREE MONTHS WORTH OF DATA AT THAT POINT IN TIME. RIGHT NOW THE THE NUMBERS OF REQUESTS ARE. REAL FAIRLY REALLY FAIRLY LOW -- WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THEM TOGETHER AT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND LOOK AT THAT AND THAT WOULD BE -- COMING BACK TO YOU AS A REPORT IN SEPTEMBER OKAY RIGHT OKAY COMES FROM OHIO. WE'VE REVIEWED ' ASSUMPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN USED -- TO CALCULATE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR I JUST SAYS AND REYES NO MAJOR CONCERNS ONE THING WE WOULD NOTE -- THE ADMINISTRATION DOES PROPOSED TO CONTINUE FUNDING THE RESTORATION OF THE 7% WHICH UNDER CURRENT LAW WAS TIED TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE MCO TAX -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HOWEVER DOES NOT IN THE NCO TAX SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR -- BUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY FORM OF A RENEWAL OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT FOR THE MCO TAX BUT SO GIVEN THAT IT'S THE INTENT FOR THE RESTORATION OF I JUST SAYS. OURS TO BE ONGOING IS STILL IN EXISTENCE THAT LINKS IT TO THEM SO TAX SO WE JUST RAISE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IF IT'S THE TRUE INTENT. AND IF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION WANT THIS TO BE ON GOING ON IN FUTURE YEARS THEN CHANGING THE STATUTORY FLAG THAT MAY BE NEEDED. OKAY SO WE NEED TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. TO BUT ON WHICH ALL RIGHT FINANCE COMMENTS. SENATE HAMMER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS THE ELLIE -- HAS NOTED THE BUDGET DOES NOT ASSUME EXTENSION OF THE MANAGED. CARE ORGANIZATION TAX HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO RESTORE THE SOME PERCENT THROUGH BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. ON AN ONGOING BASIS THE COST RESTORE THE 7% REDUCTION IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY TWO POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND. AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WE HAVE ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS CONCERNING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FIRST BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. AND WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE THEIR CURRENT CONCERNS INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE GO INTO MAY REVISION. OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND OKAY CAN ACTUALLY TO STIR ON THE SAID THE ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS -- THE TERMS OF FIVE ERRORS -- THAT -- MAY HAVE SHOWN UP -- TERMS OF AS IF YOU THE YET -- ARE -- BECAUSE OF THE THERE'S A SHOWED UP ON THEIR TIME CARDS UNDER FLSA. SO I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- VIOLATIONS WERE USEFUL ARE GOING ABOVE THE WEEK RIGHT -- HOURS STRAIGHT SO. SOMETHING'S WE HAVE THE INFORMATION FOR YOU ON THAT SORRY [inaudible] TO HAVE. PUT IT AWAY WITH SOME OTHER PAPER -- CAN'T OF NINETY FOUR YEAH. SO. IN THIS LAST -- FISCAL YEAR FROM JANUARY EIGHTEENTH THROUGH DECEMBER OF EIGHTEEN THERE WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT INDIVIDUALS THAT RECEIVED A THIRD VIOLATION. WHICH IS THE THREE MONTH -- SUSPENSION. AND THE FOURTH VIOLATION THERE WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE PEOPLE THAT RECEIVE THAT. NOW THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE AT THOSE WITH THE COUNTIES AS WELL AS IF THEY LOSE THAT DISPUTE TO APPEAL THAT TO THE STATE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEWS -- ON THE THIRD VIOLATIONS WE DID OVER TURNED THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX AT THE STATE LEVEL OF THOSE VIOLATIONS AND ON THE FOURTH WHEN WE OVERTURNED FORTY SIX OF THOSE. SO -- PROPORTIONALLY TO THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS WE HAVE THESE ARE OUR VERY SMALL NUMBERS ON BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS DOES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON INDIVIDUALS SO WE CONTINUE. TO OUR OUR OWN STAFF AT THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW LEVEL AS WELL AS WORKING WITH COUNTY STAFF TO REALLY -- TO OUTREACH AND EDUCATION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH THESE -- ISSUES AND MAYBE MISS UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON FILLING OUT TIME SHEETS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL BE OCCURRING AND IS ALREADY OCCURRING IN ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS AND THEN WE'LL CONTINUE WITH EBV. ON THE IS THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF WILL PROMPT PEOPLE AS THEY COMPLETE THEIR TIME SHEET TO LET THEM KNOW IF THEY'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE CLAIMING HOURS THAT WILL LEAD TO A VIOLATION. SO IF PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING NOW TO USE ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS THEY GET THOSE PROBLEMS AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE CONTINUED TO DO IS ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO UTILIZE THE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT. AND AS PEOPLE MOVE INTO EBV BOTH ON THE TELEPHONE AND ON THE ONLINE SYSTEM THEY WILL GET -- DOT SUPPORT AS WELL AS THE ON GOING OUT REACH AND TRAINING FROM THE COUNTIES AND THE STATE LEVEL AND WHAT PROPORTION OF PEOPLE ARE USING THE LIKE TRYING TIME SHEETS NOW. ABOUT 32% OF 32% AND HOW LONG AND HISTORIC TRY TIME SHEETS BEEN AROUND. LITTLE OVER A YEAR. YEAR AND A HALF ALMOST TWO GOING ON TO JUST THINKING LIKE AT THE THIS. THE IN THE LIKE THE ONLY A YEAR EXPERIENCE USE IT YOU'RE EXPECTING THIS TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK PART OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS INITIALLY BECAUSE IT WAS COMPLETELY. OPTIONAL THERE WASN'T A LOT OF PUSH -- IN AND OUT REACH -- TO TRANSITION FOLKS AS WE'VE MADE THE DETERMINATION TO USE OUR ELECTRONIC TIME SHEETS SYSTEM OUT SO -- OUR APPROACH TO COMPLIANCE WITH EVEY VIA KNOWING THAT THAT WILL BECOME A MANDATE WE'VE REALLY -- CHANGE THAT APPROACH AND NOW ARE DOING MONTHLY TIME SHEETS STAFFERS AND INFORMATION OUT TO FOLKS WERE FINDING THAT WITH THOSE STAFFERS WERE GETTING ABOUT A 2% BUMP EACH TIME. AND WE ALSO HAVE AN INITIATED A LOT OF WORK WITH THE COUNTIES TO DO SOME -- MORE OUTREACH AROUND THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT WE ANTICIPATE THAT THOUGHT WILL. START GOING UP MORE AND MORE OVER TIME. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THE LAW WE GO THEN -- TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE WHICH IS I. TO ASSESS MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT -- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND WE HAVE -- GRAHAM KNAUSS FROM THEY CALPERS THE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WELCOME -- TO GIVE US -- ACTUAR START WITH ELLEN HAVING A START WITH LA OKAY ALL RIGHT SO AT THE LA -- WE HAVE A WALK SO FIRST OF ALL WE ARE HEAVILY OPENS GONNA WALK THROUGH -- OUR GRAPHIC ABOUT NINE ONE REALIGNMENT -- AND THEN THAT WE HAVE THE PART OF FINANCE PROVIDE THERE A BRIEF SUMMARY IF THEY'RE REPORT ON SB NINETY NINETY ONE REALIGNMENTS AND AND THE HAVE AND DISCUSS HOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS REPORT REFLECTED THE POSE POSE CHANGES THAT MEANS OF EFFORT AND THEN THE LA -- WILL RESPOND AND THEN WE'LL HAVE -- STRAUSS -- SPEAK AS WELL AND COMMENT SO -- IT'S ONE OF THE FOUR WE'VE DIED INTO THIS IS THAT -- WELL CERTAINLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AYE HSS ONE OF THINGS I WANT TO SORT TOUCH ON IS NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT BECAUSE THAT TYPE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THIS IS FOR THIS YEAR I SHOULD SAY. UP TO SEE EVERY YEAR WE RUN IT WE TOUCH ON THIS -- THIS IS GONNA BE THE FIRST PROGRAM. THAT TOUCHED ON NIGHT ONE REALIGNMENT WE WILL LATER ON WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT ACCOUNT MANAGED CARE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. YEAH PUBLIC HEALTH COUNTY LEVEL IT'S ADDRESS SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US THIS IN A FEW MOMENTS. GOING OVER WHAT NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT IS AND JUST -- IS AS BACKGROUND --% AS BEFORE WE GET INTO THIS MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT I JUST US AND COUNTY FUNDING SO. LET'S GO AHEAD BEGIN WITH LA JOH. SO ON PAGE THIRTY FIVE OF THE AGENDA YOU'LL FIND A FLOW CHART THAT JUSTICE BLAZE HOW NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT IS STRUCTURED. AND WE WERE ASKED TO BROACH JUST WALK THROUGH THIS. SO IN GENERAL REALIGNMENT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT PROVIDES COUNTIES WITH DEDICATED REVENUES TO PAY FOR PROGRAM COSTS. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE SPECIFICALLY. A NUMBER OF COSTA RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SOCIAL SERVICES HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS WERE LARGELY TRANSFERRED FROM THE STATE TO THE COUNTIES. SO WHEN YOU SEE IN THE CHART IT'S BESET THE REVENUES THAT THAN WERE PROVIDED TO COUNTIES TO PAY FOR THESE NEW COST. WAS BOTH A PORTION OF THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEE AND A PORTION OF SALES TAX AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DOES TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF MAGNITUDE LF REVENUE THAT FLOWED TO NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE REALIGNMENT WAS AROUND. TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND THE AMOUNT OF SALES TAX THAT FLOWED TO REALIGNMENT WAS AROUND THREE BILLION. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART REALIGNMENT IS MADE UP OF A NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS AND THEY'RE GENERALLY DEFINED BY PROGRAM AREA SOCIAL SERVICES HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH. NOW HOW THE REVENUES FLOW WITHIN THE STRUCTURE THEY FOLLOW RANK ORDER. THE SOCIAL SERVICES ACCOUNT GETS THE FIRST CALL ON THE DOLLAR. AND THIS SUB ACCOUNT INCLUDES COUNTY COST FOR I'D JUST US. THEN THE REVENUES WOULD FLOW -- TO COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAMS WHICH IS A SMALL NUMBER OF COUNTIES FOR THEIR HEALTH PROGRAMS. AND THEN LASTLY TO THE GENERAL HEALTH ACCOUNT AND MENTAL HEALTH ACCOUNTS AND YOU SEE YOU EVEN WITHIN THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH ACCOUNTS THEY HAVE SUB ACCOUNTS WITHIN THEM. IN WHICH A PORTION OF THEIR REVENUES THAT THEY GET GO TO THESE ACCOUNTS TO ULTIMATELY THAN OFFSET STATE CAL WORKS COST. NOW THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT GOES INTO EACH ACCOUNT IN ANY GIVEN YEAR -- DEPENDS ON TWO FACTORS THE FIRST BEING THAT EVERY ACCOUNT GETS THE AMOUNT THAT THEY RECEIVED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AND THAT'S REFERRED TO AS BASE FUNDING. SO ONCE EACH ACCOUNT IN THE ORDER THAT I JUST DESCRIBED GETS THERE'S THEIR BASE FUNDING TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ANY DâN REALIGNMENT REVENUES LEFTOVER. THAT'S AGAIN RE DISTRIBUTED TEACH ACOUNT IN THE ORDER AND THOSE ARE CALLED GROWTH FUNDS. ON THE WAY BACK VLF GROWTH FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED -- YOU'LL SEE THAT DAY FIRST GO TO SEE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH. IT'S REALLY THE CONVERSATION AROUND HOUSE SALES TAX GROWTH DOLLARS ARE -- HOW DO THEY FLOW THROUGH THE SYSTEM WHERE WE GET INTO THE SITE JUST AS CONVERSATION BECAUSE THE SALES TAX GROWTH FUNDS FIRST GO TO THE SOCIAL SERVICES SUB ACCOUNT? AND THE COSTS THAT THOSE GROWTH DOLLARS ARE USED TO COVER REFLECT YEAR TO YEAR GROWTH IN THE PROGRAMS WITHIN THE SOCIAL SERVICES ACCOUNT. AND THOSE -- GROWTH IS ATTRIBUTED IN MOST CASES TO JUST GROWTH IN CASELOAD. NOW TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH GROWTH DOLLARS TO COVER THOSE COST -- THEN THAT MEANS IN THAT PARTICULAR YEAR SALES TAX GROWTH DOLLARS DON'T FLOW TO HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND THAT CAN HAPPEN FOR AND MULTIPLE YEARS BECAUSE THE WAY THAT REALIGNMENT WORKS IS IF THERE ANY IF THERE'S ANY ON MAC COST WITHIN THE SOCIAL SERVICES UP ACCOUNT FACTS TRACKED. UNTIL IT'S PAID IN FULL WITH FUTURE REVENUE SOURCES -- SO COULD BE A NUMBER OF YEARS UNTIL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH I'M SEIZE ANY FORM OF SALES TAX GROWTH AND THAT'S THE SITUATION -- WE GOT OURSELVES IN IN THE RECENT YEARS WITH THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE TO I JUST AS COUNTY COST WERE UNDER CURRENT LAW. COUNTY COSTA -- WERE SO LARGE THAT REALIZE COVER THEM SO WHAT THAT MEANT FOR HELP HEALTH AND MENTAL IN THE CASE O SALES TAXES THAT NO DOLLARS ARE FLOWING TO THEIR TO THOSE ACCOUNTS BUT ALSO. BE A LEFT GROWTH FUNDS WERE TEMPORALLY RE DIRECTED FROM HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH TO PAY OFF -- I JUST AS COST AND I'LL LET FINANCE EXPLAIN SOME OF THEIR CHANGES THAT UNDO SOME OF THESE THINGS AND ALLOW ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE MORE FUNDS -- TO FLORIDA HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH AND THEN I'LL SHARE OUR COMMENTS ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. I THANK YOU FINANCE. GREAT THANK YOU CITY TEHAMA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS YOU MENTIONED MISTER CHAIR IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE REPORT WILL BE DISCUSSED IN FUTURE HEARING SO I'M HAPPY TO GIVE A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF THE DEPARTMENT FINDS ANNOUNCES NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT REPORT. THE PRIMARY FINDING BASS OUR ANALYSIS IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE AVAILABLE UNDER NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT CANNOT SUPPORT THE COST OF THE CURRENT PROGRAMS FUNDED WITH REALIGNMENT. THIS IS NOT DUE TO CONSTRUCT CONSTRUCT OF THE ORIGINAL DESIGN BUT IT'S MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES. THAT HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE REALIGN PROGRAMS PRIMARILY I HSS. AND SOME OF THESE CHANGES ARE THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES AND PAID OVERTIME. THERE'S ALSO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE INDIGENT HEALTH POPULATION AND THE REDIRECTION OF FUNDS TO SUPPORT CAO WORKS GRANT INCREASES. BASED ON THIS REPORTS FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A NUMBER CHANGES TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH THREE MAIN GOALS. FOR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE REST ACCOUNTING IS OF HAVING TO USE GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDS TO COVER AYE HSS COSTS. SECOND FREE OF NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT GROWTH REVENUES FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH AS THE ELLIE -- HAD ALLUDED. TO AND THIRD IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY FLEXITY IT CURRENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH NINETY NINE DO YOU WANT RELY MAC THINK REALIGNMENTS PRETTY MUCH SYNONYMOUS WITH COMPLEXITY. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS THE BUDGET SPECIFICALLY PROPOSES TO REDUCE THE STATE WHY COUNTY I HSS MOE AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FROM TWO BILLION TO APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FIVE SIX BILLION. A REDUCTION OF FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. THE REVISED IMHO YOU PROJECT REFLECTS THE PROJECTED LEVEL COUNTIES I HSS COSTS THAT CAN BE FUNDED WITH IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR. SECONDLY THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO REDUCE THE ANNUAL MOE INFLATION FACTOR FROM 7% 24% BEGINNING AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ELIMINATE THE GENERAL FUND MITIGATION. GOING FORWARD. THIRDLYTHE BUDGET PROPOSES TO STOP THE REDIRECTION THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT GROWTH FROM MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH TWO HSS SO RE DIRECTED BACK TO INITIALLY WHERE IT WAS FLOWING. TO THE PROBE THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO TEMPORARILY ELIMINATE GROWTH ALLOCATIONS TO THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM BOARD BEGINNING AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY DUE TO THE BOARD SIGNIFICANT OPERATING RESERVE. THIS PROVIDES ADDITIONAL GROWTH FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH. AND LASTLY THE BUDGETS PROPOSING TO STREAMLINE THE DISTRIBUTION OF GENERAL GROWTH FUNDS BY ESTABLISHING FIXED ALLOCATIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND CAL WORKS. THE PROPOSAL TO REDUCE THE COUNTY I HSS MOE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES GENERAL FUND COSTS GOING FORWARD COMPARED TO CURRENT LAW. SAID BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FORTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY GROWING TO FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY TWO TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE WE KNOW THAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE REST TO COUNTIES FROM THE POTENTIAL REVENUE. DECLINES THAT WE THOUGHT WERE PART OF THE ORIGINAL NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT STRUCTURE. HOWEVER THE SIGNIFICANT FUSION A GENERAL FUND MEANS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS FOR US TO COUNTIES WITH USING GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDS TO COVER I IT JUST AS PROGRAM COSTS. THANK YA HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SELL FOR HERE BACK FROM LA -- AND THEN WE'LL TAKE SOME QUESTIONS FROM COUNSEL FINANCE MENTIONED TO THEIR CHANGES MODE THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE I JUST AS RELATED IN THOSE ARE THE BIG SIGNIFICANT ONES THERE IS -- OTHER PROPOSES THAT WOULD AFFECT HEALTH THE MENTAL HEALTH WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN FUTURE BUDGET HEARINGS -- OUR OFFICE IN ANTICIPATION OF FINANCE RELEASING THEIR REPORT JANUARY WE DID -- OUR OWN ASSESSMENT OF NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT BACK IN OCTOBER WHERE WE ARE GENERAL I IDENTIFIED GENERAL PRINCIPLES. IN WHICH YOU COULD USE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OR A VALUE IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT. AND WE FOUND SOMEWHERE TO WHAT FINANCE FOUND IN THEIR REPORT IS -- THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THERE WAS A MISALIGNMENT WITH THOSE PRINCIPLES -- FINANCES RECOMMEND RECOMMENDED CHANGES TO I JUST SAYS DEFINITELY MOVES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF MEETING THE CORE PRINCIPLES THAT WE IDENTIFIED SPECIFICALLY THAT COST WITHIN -- BACK COUNTY COST REFLECT THEIR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY CONTROL THE PROGRAM. FIVE REDUCING THE COUNTY ACOSTA NITROUS AS WE THINK THAT THE TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT THEN ALSO THAT REVENUES WITHIN REALIGNMENT COVER COST OVER TIME IN THESE CHANGES IMPROVE THAT PROBABILITY -- WE ALSO REYES -- SOME GENERAL BIG PICTURE QUESTIONS -- FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ONE BEING THAT WHETHER REALIGNMENT REVENUES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER COUNTIES COST IN THE LONG TERM REMAINS UNCLEAR THAT'S JUST DUMB. HOW REALIGNMENT WORKS SO SOMETHING THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS REALIGNMENT REVENUES AND IN ANY GIVEN YEAR -- ARE THEY GENERALLY COVERING COUNTY COST. AND THEN THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAD IS WHY -- BY REDUCING THE I JUST SIZE COUNTY COSTS THAT THEN SHIFTS COSTS A GREATER AMOUNT OF BY JUST AS COST TO THE STATE AND WE FIND THIS APPROPRIATE -- HOWEVER THIS DOES RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEN THE STATE'S ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS BUT THEN ALSO -- LOOKING AT COST PRESSURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AGING POPULATION THAT WE MAY SEE AND I JUST US SO SUMMER TO THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD EARLIER IN THIS HEARING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT. HOW DO WE PLAN FOR THE IMPACT OF THE GROWING AGING POPULATION IN THE STATE BUDGET -- FITS IN WITH US AS WELL DO YOU. RIGHT SEC MR HOUSE. I THANK YOU SENATOR PAN I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A COUNTY PERSPECTIVE ON THE GOVERNOR SITE TO ASSESS AND WE PROPOSAL -- ITEM GRAND CANAL SOME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C. SACK. THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND WE REPRESENT ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AND I'M GONNA PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS RELATIVE. TO WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE WE SIT TODAY AND HOW WE SEE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND ALL ACTUALLY BEGIN WITH THE PUNCH LINE WHICH IS REALLY THAT WERE THANKFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE COMMITMENT OF ADDITIONAL STATE GENERAL FUND -- TO STABILIZE A PROGRAM IN THE STABILIZE THE OVERALL REALIGNMENT. AS AS COUNTIES WE ARE STEWARDS OF A NUMBER OF STATE PROGRAMS THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE -- WITH -- WITH AYE TO ASSESS -- WE'RE PROUD TO STAND WITH THE STATE AS A PARTNER IN ADMINISTERING THE I JUST AS PROGRAM. I'M TO MEET THE NEEDS OF MORE THAN HALF A MILLION FOLKS AT THAT ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY SUIT TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN. SAFELY REMAIN -- WITHIN THEIR HOMES. WHEN WE THINK BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE WE NEGOTIATED WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION. I'M A COUNTY I JUST US AND WE THAT -- THAT -- WHO HAD A TWO YEAR RE EXAMINATION IN TERMS OF WHERE WE WERE AT -- AND THAT PROVISION -- FOR US IS CRITICAL TO THAT AS WE WERE GOING THROUGH A NEW MODEL WITH A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF CHANGE. THAT WE KEPT IN MIND. THE RISK SHARING -- THAT EXISTED BETWEEN THE STATE AND COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT FROM A LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE -- WE COULD HAVE SUSTAINABILITY OF PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE -- ACCESS TO DELIVER ON THEIR BEHALF. SO THIS. THIS RE EXAMINATION WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT BALANCE POINT OF INSURING -- APPROPRIATE SHARED RISK BETWEEN THE STATE AND COUNTIES. BUT AS WE WALKED IN -- THIS AM A WE WE HAD -- CONFIDENCE THAT IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS WE COULD MANAGE THROUGH WITH THE ANIMAL WE WITHOUT I'M SEVERE DISRUPTION RELATED TO PROGRAMS. I'M NOT WITHSTANDING THE REDIRECTION OF BOTH PUBLIC HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH RELATED FUNDING WITHIN THE REALIGNMENT. BUT WE ALSO KNEW THAT. AS WE GOT TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND BEYOND. THAT THE COST WOULD INCREASE AT A MUCH FASTER RATE THAN THE REVENUES THAT WE WOULD RECEIVE -- TWO TO FUND THOSE COSTS AND SO THIS IS WHERE -- WE ALONG WITH THE SO HAVE A VERY SIMILAR ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF OF WHERE THINGS WERE. WE'RE GOING. SINCE OUR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN COUNTIES HAVE. WORKED DILIGENTLY TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT -- THE ANIMAL WE I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF ELEMENTS OF THE EMMA WE THAT. WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH -- THAT TO LEAD US UP -- TO TO THIS PROPOSAL. THE FIRST IS THAT. THE INCREASE COSTS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED UP TO COUNTIES -- OCCURRED IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO THERE'S THOSE THINGS -- ATTRIBUTED TO REGULAR PROGRAM CASE SLOW GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM WHICH IS ABOUT 4% -- AND THEN -- CHANGES THAT OCCUR THAT WERE OUTSIDE OF COUNTY CONTROL THAT DEAL WITH -- STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES AND ALSO DEAL WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL -- OVERTIME RELATED RULES BECAUSE OF THOSE INCREASED COSTS -- BEING FAR HIGHER THAN THE REVENUES AVAILABLE WITHIN THE REALIGNMENT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE M. A WE WORKABLE AND THIS IS WHERE THAT REDIRECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH RELATED. I'M REVENUE -- OCCURRED. SO WE WE KNEW WE COULD WIN THROUGH THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS BUT THAT THAT WAS NOT SUSTAINABLE. WHICH IS WHY I'M WITHOUT AS SIGNIFICAN INTERVENTION WE'VE KNOWN THAT WE'VE BEEN HEADED. FOR THIS CLIP AS THE STATE GENERAL FUND WAS OTHERWISE SLATED TO DECREASE OVER TIME AS OUR COSTS -- ACTUALLY WENT UP. SO WITHIN THIS CONTEXT -- COUNTIES HAVE UTILIZED SOME OF THE NEW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. JURORS AND TOOLS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE -- TO MAKE SOME FOR PROGRESS RELATIVE. TO LABOR AGREEMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- FOR ARE I TO ASSESS -- PROVIDERS -- AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE WITH THE UTILIZING OF THE WAGE SUPPLEMENT AND ADDITIONAL STATE SHARON AND I'M SO WE'VE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. WITH THIS -- NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT REPORT IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT'S IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUT NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. I'M WERE ABLE TO BRING SOME STABILITY TO NOT JUST A TO SAYS BUT ALSO TO THE REALIGNMENT -- MORE BROADLY -- AND AS WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY BOTH THE MINISTRATION ELIO -- STOP THE REDIRECTION OF REVENUE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- TO ENSURE THAT CHEMICAL DISEASE CONTROL -- SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE RELATED EFFORTS CAN CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND SO I WANT. TO ACKNOWLEDGE -- THE ADMINISTRATION FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH US -- FOR BOTH HEARING OUR CONCERNS -- AND I'M PUTTING A PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET. THAT -- STABILIZES -- HEIGHTS ASSESSES THE PROGRAM -- PROVIDES A SUSTAINABILITY IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL REALIGNMENT -- CLEARLY AS A LA APPOINTED. THIS IS STILL A SHARED RISK MODEL AND SO THERE IS -- REMAINING RISK WITH ON THE COUNTY SIDE JUST AS THERE IS ON THE STATE SIDE. AS WELL -- BUT WE SEE THIS PROPOSAL AS FAIR AND BALANCED IN TERMS OF PROVIDING THAT STABILITY I'M RECOGNIZING THAT OF WHICH COSTS CAN BE CONTROLLED AND BY WHOM. AND AS A RESULT WERE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL AND WHEN YOU CAN ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO MOVE IT FORWARD AS WELL. RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL. FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- I THINK THAT -- WHEN MY THINGS AS WE LOOK AT -- REALIGNMENT I APPRECIATE I THINK I AGREE THAT -- THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AB REALLY DOES COME DOWN TO THE YOU KNOW WHO'S BEARING THE FINANCIAL BURDEN. WHO ACTUALLY HAS CONTROL OVER THE COSTS LIKE THE WORST SITUATION IS THAT YOU HAVE AN EXPENSE THAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOU DON'T HAVE THE AND THEN YOU DON'T AND? AND ALSO TIED TO A REVENUE STREAM THAT YOU ACTUALLY CAN'T MANAGE EITHER RIGHT SO -- FOR EXAMPLE -- WELL AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME OF RALEIGH VLS IT'S NOT LIKE A COUNTY CAN REYES STIR FEEL LASSIE SEPARATELY FROM OTHER COUNTIES RIGHT IF I DON'THAVE A FEEL LEFT REVENUE ARE JUST RAISED VEAL A FEW MY COUNTY RIGHT. THAT'S THAT'S THAT SAID IT STATE RIGHT SO THAT VLF MONEY. HOW MUCH YOU GONNA GET PART OF IT'S A TEN OF COURSE ON HOW MANY CARS YOU HOUSE RIGHT WHICH YOU DON'T DECIDE EITHER YOU CAN'T TAKE PEOPLE BUYER MORE OR LESS CARS IN YOUR COUNTY OR OUR OWN MORE OR LESS CARS AND CUT IT SHOULD SAY BECAUSE PEOPLE MOVE? IN THE PAPER. BUT THEN ALSO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE SET THE FEET RIGHT SO THAT'S GOING TO BE THAT SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THAT GREAT. SALES TAX A LITTLE DIFFERENT YOLO CONTROL YOU COULD YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IF YOU GO BACK TO YOUR VOTERS AND SO FORTH PERSUADE PEOPLE THAT THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT. SO -- SO I MEAN AS WE LOOK AT THAT AND THEN ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TRADE OFFS RATES OF FOR EXAMPLE I HSS WON THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT OUR INVESTMENT AYE HSS. ALSO ALLOWS US TO ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY LOWER AND WE'VE DONE STUDIES WHICH LOOKED AT THIS LOWER SOME OF THE STATE SPENDING ON INSTITUTIONS RIGHT WHICH IS ACTUALLY COST US FOR BY THE STATE NOT BY COUNTY SO -- SO IT'S GOOD THAT THE STATE HAS DAVE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE RE PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THIS IT MAKES SENSE FOR US BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY CAN REDUCE OUR COSTS IN THE SIDE WHERE IS THE COUNTIES LIKE WELL WE'LL WE CAN. PUT MORE MONEY INTO IT AND SAVE MONEY BUT WE DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT SAVINGS RIGHT SO THINKING ABOUT HOW THAT I REALIZE THESE ARE MULTIPLE THREADS THAT RUN THROUGH THINGS BUT NOW THAT THAT IS WHAT IT IS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS I KNOW THAT BACK IN. WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS COUPLE YEARS AGO AND A DEAL DID COME TOGETHER? KNIVES CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THESE THINGS INTERPLAY AND WHERE'D INCENTIVES BEING CUT RIGHT FOR FOR THE DIFFERENT PARTIES THE STATE THE COUNTIES AND SO FORTH IN TERMS OF BEING SURE THAT. YOU DON'T HAVE -- I GUESS -- YEAH. WELL ATTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARE MISALIGNED INCENTIVES RATE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO TO CHEAT THE CHEMICALS MY CHIEF WITH WITH THE PROGRAM. AND SO I DO THINK THIS IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- I CLEARLY IT DOES PUT A GREATER BURDEN ON YOU KNOW THE STATE WHICH MEANS THAT I HAVE TO SAY THE OKAY HOW WE GONNA FIGURE OUT WE HAVE. YOU HERE WE HAVE LOTS PROPOSALS FOR THINGS PEOPLE WANT IT TO GET FUNDED RIGHT OUT THERE AND AND WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING ON AN ONGOING BASIS OF LARGE PORTION OF THE AYE HSS RATE SO THAT MEANS THAT ON STATE SIDE. BARRING ADDITIONAL REVENUES THAT PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON ANY OTHER PROGRAM THE STATE FUNDS AS WELL -- BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING COUNTIES AT SQUEEZE OUT OTHER THINGS SO WE HAD A HEARING ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND WILL DELVE MORE DEBT LATER WE HAVE HEARING ON MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT. AND SO WHEN THAT. LATER LIVE OF A RUN DOWN THERE'S NOBODY GOING THERE WELL WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN RIGHT SO -- SO I THINK THAT -- SO I DO APPRECIATE -- THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL I THINK AS WE CONTINUE TO BEFORE WE NEED TO LOOK AT I THINK IS MENTIONED EXACTLY. WELLS WAS WAY [inaudible] WE'RE FUNDING. HSS BUT THE DEMAND FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NOT AT LEAST I KNOW OF MAYBE SOMEONE DID MIKE MACRO ECONOMIC ANALYSIS IS TIED TO THE NUMBER OF CARS IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION OR THE AMOUNT OF RETAIL SALES THAT HAPPENS IN IN A COUNTY RIGHT. SO THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FUNDING SOURCE AND THE AND WHAT'S PAYING FOR IS NOT NECESSARILY YOU YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ALIGNED THAT WAY AND THAT NOT. SO -- WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THE FUNDING STREAM MAILED IS IS IS IS GOING TO BE ADEQUATE ON AN ONGOING BASIS OVER TIME SO WE NEED TO CERTAINLY MONITOR THAT. SHE LOKED OVER TIME AND CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THE STATE HAS TO LOOK AT AS WELL WERE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON INCOME TAX REVENUE -- CAPITAL GAINS REVENUE SO WE HAVE A MORE VOLATILE WE'RE TRYING -- TO AND I APPRECIATE GOVERNOR BROWN THIS IS LEADERS AND CERTAINLY STEPS WE'VE TAKEN THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO BE SURE WE CAN -- LEVEL OUT THE BULBS SAID TO THE DEGREE WE CAN -- TO BECAUSE RECOGNIZING WHAT WE SPEND THINGS ON ACTUALLY FIRST OF ALL GENERALLY TENDS TO BE MORE CONSTANT IN A REVENUE STREAM AND ALSO TENDS TO BE SOMEWHAT COUNTER CYCLICALS WELL SO THE DEMAND GOES UP WHEN OUR REVENUES ARE DOWN. SO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES IS -- SOMETHING THAT -- WE WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO SURE WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING AND I APPRECIATE THE THE THE THE GOVERNOR'S -- LEADERSHIP IN TRYING TO AT LEAST I THINK MOVE THIS MIGHTY ONE REALIGNMENT PORTION TO I THINK WE'RE MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF MAKES MORE SENSE THAN THAN IT DID BEFORE -- RECOGNIZING IT DOES MEAN MORE BURDEN ON THE STATE -- OF A TERMS OF ITS US.

HI SENATOR PAN MY NAME IS CHRISTINE ABBAS HAMILTON WITH YOU W. APPS ME LOCAL THIRTY NINE THIRTY WE REPRESENT. I JUST AS PROVIDERS IN TWENTY ONE COUNTIES AND I'M HERE TO INTRODUCE FLORENCE CROSSAN WHO IS THE CHAIR OF DISTRICT FOR FOR UT W. SHE IS AND I JUST AS PROVIDER. OKAY AND DOES HE ALSO SPEAKING YEAH JUST AS CONSUMER FORMER WORKER ARE THE CALIFORNIA ALLSTATE COMMITTEE LOCAL AGENT SAYS COMMITTEE AND MULTIPLE OTHER COMMITTEES. EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT WHICH COULD BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. LIKE CRISTINA SAID MY NAME IS FLORENCE PRESIDENT EMMA I JUST AS PROVIDER. FROM MERCED COUNTY I CARE FOR MY MOM DOROTHY. AND I'VE BEEN A PROVIDER FOR A LIVING YEARS. UNLIKE MOST CARE GIVERS MY DAYS ARE HARD ENOUGH. A LOT OF THE CARE THAT WE PROVIDE IS PERSONAL. AND WOULD NOT BE RIGHT TO SHARE WITH ANYONE. AND STOPPING OUR WORK TO REPORT THESE DETAILS WOULD TAKE TIME THAT WE DON'T HAVE. WE DO WANT OUR PRIVACY WE DO NOT WANT OUR PRIVACY TO BE INVADED AND WE DON'T WANT THE PRIVACY OF OUR CLIENTS TO BE INVADED EITHER. AND THAT'S WHY WHEN I JUST AS PROVIDERS FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE V. V.. WE WERE LIKE REALLY WORRIED. IT'S KIND OF CONCERNING. I I KNOW THAT THE STATE IS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO IMPLEMENT THE EBV BY JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE I ALSO KNOW THAT BECAUSE PROVIDERS AND CLIENTS MADE OUR VOICES HEARD. DSS HAS OUTLINED AND EBV PLAN THAT IS MINIMALLY INVASIVE AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENTS LEADERSHIP ON THIS. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATOR PASSED VERY IMPORTANT PRTECTIONS. SOME OF THESE ARE. MANDATING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WHERE YOU W. IS AT THE TABLE TO REPRESENT THE VOICES AND CONCERNS OF OUR MEMBERS. IMPLEMENTING ETV BY CD SS MUST BE IN A WAY THAT IS NOT A BURDEN TO I JUST AS PROVIDERS AND CLIENTS. NO GPS TRACKING NO VIOLATIONS FOR PROVIDERS. GUARANTEEING THAT PROVIDERS ARE SUFFICIENTLY TRAINED ON THE STATE'S NEW EBV SYSTEM. COMMITMENT THAT HOMESTED RIGHTS OF I'D JUST AS CLIENTS ARE NOT INFRINGED UPON. SO I ASK PLEASE PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CARE GIVERS AND OUR CLIENTS. BY WRITING THE SAME EBV PROTECTIONS INTO THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SO THAT THEY WILL BECOME PERMANENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I ACTUALLY HAVE TWO SUBJECTS EVEY V. JUST BE WHATEVER MADE A SPECIAL ROSY -- EBV WILL HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON SENIORS BLIGHTED PEOPLE DISABILITIES TAKING AWAY FROM HAVING TO PAY FOR SYSTEM WILL TAKE AWAY FROM THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT TIME SHEETS. IN SOME CASES AND CURRENT FIVE SYSTEM HAS A LOT TO BE FIXED WHEN IT COMES TO USING IT FOR EBV. EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE TAKING AWAY THE PAPER TIME SHEETS RECIPIENTS AND THE PROVIDER WILL STILL HAVE AN ABILITY TO PRINT. PAST TIME SHEETS AND THEIR RECORDS BELIEVE IT OR NOT CDSS HAS MADE. A MESS MOST OF THE REQUEST REGARDING CATION A SENIORS AND OTHERS WHO ARE AFRAID OF COMPUTERS IS GREATLY NEEDED. HOW HOW CAN THIS BE STRESSED THAT IT PAYS MORE THAN STE THE STAFF IN THE OFFICE BUT FOR STAFF THAT GOES OUT IN THE FIELD OF WORKS WITH THE CONSUMERS AND THE PROVIDERS? SAID THE EEVEE IS PUT IN PLACE. OUTRAGE IS DONE IN A WAY IT WILL IMPACT A LOT OF HIGHLY VVV IS IMPLEMENTED OVERALL AND HAVING A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES FOR RECIPIENTS CENTER PROVIDERS. THERE ARE STILL MANY ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE JOINTLY WORKED OUT WITH ON CONSUMER GROUPS AND WITH PROVIDERS. I WOULD HOPE CSS WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THOSE WHO WERE IMPACTED BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE V.. I ALSO WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE 87% ARE YOU WANT TO HANG ON THERE WHEN WE GET TO THAT PANEL JUST IF YOU DON'T MIND I WISH YOU CAN JUST STAY RIGHT THERE WHEN WE GET THAT PANEL YOU WOULD HAVE YOU SPEAK ON THAT AS WELL.

VERY BRIEFLY MISTER CHAIR WE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND IN THEIR HAND OUT THAT MY COLLEAGUE WENT THROUGH FOR YOU ON PAGE NINETEEN LAYS OUT THE POLICY PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY BOTH DISCUSSED. WE DON'T PARTICULARLY HAVE AN OBJECTION TO THOSE BEING CODIFIED WE'VE BEEN CLEAR IN ALL OF OUR MEETINGS -- CONSULTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS IS CRITICAL IT'S MANDATED BY FEDERAL LAW THE FEDERAL LAW ALSO MANDATES TO BE MINIMALLY BURDENSOME OR INVASIVE -- TO USE THE TERM PROTECTING THE ONSTAD RIGHTS AS LONG BEEN A PRINCIPAL IN THE PROGRAM SO WE WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION. OKAY. LA -- ANY COMMENTS ALL RIGHT FINANCE. NO ALL RIGHT. OKAY WELL CERTAINLY THOSE OUR BEST PRACTICES WITH I WANT YOU TO STAY THERE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE WHAT I DO ANOTHER PANEL THAT WE GET TO YOUR SECOND ONE SO IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE THERE. THANK YOU. PLEASE HANG OUT WITH US ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO THE NEXT ITEM IS THE ACTUAL STUDY FOR LTE ASSESS FINANCING SERVICE OPTIONS. SO WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA AGING AND DISABILITY ALLIANCE WELCOME RIGHT. OKAY SO -- WHEN YOU ALL GET UP HERE INTRODUCE YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD AND EACH OF THE FORTY A YEAR HI INTERVIEW OF YOUR TIME? OKAY SO FIRST LET'S DO INTRODUCTIONS. BUDGET HAND INDUCTOR PUBLIC POLICY LEADING AGE CALIFORNIA. CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. AND I'M PRETTY WILL FIND THE STATEWIDE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR SEIU LOCAL TWENTY FIFTEEN WE REPRESENT THE AGES AS PROVIDERS AND THE OTHER. AT THIRTY SEVEN COMPANIES. I WANT TO BEGIN. GREAT THANK YOU A DOCTOR PAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AGAIN MY NAME IS TO ENHANCE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR LEADING AGE CALIFORNIA. LEADING IS CALIFORNIA IS THE STATE'S LEADING ADVOCATE FOR QUALITY AND NOT FOR PROFIT SENIOR LIVING IN CARE. OUR ASSOCIATIONS MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDE PROVIDERS OF SENIOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES AND SKILLED NURSING CARE. OUR MEMBERS REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SENIORS -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BUDGET ITEM -- WE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF KATO THE CALIFORNIA AGING DISABILITY ALLIANCE WHICH IS TWENTY ORGANIZATIONS THAT -- SHARING THAT SHARE A COMMON INTEREST AND COMMITMENT TO CREATING AFFORDABLE HERE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE HA WHEN CAR CONGRESS FORMALLY REPEALED THE COMMUNITY LIVING ASSISTANCE SERVICE IN SPORTS OR THE CLASS ACT. OUR ORGANIZATION HAS RETIRED TIRELESSLY TO FIND NEW WAYS ON HOW WE CAN. PAY FOR LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. IN LATE -- TWENTY THIRTEEN OUR NATIONAL ORGANIZATION LEADING AGE PARTNERED WITH A. R. P. IN THE SKIN FOUNDATION TO JOINTLY FUND AND ECONOMIC AN ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS WITH THE URBAN INSTITUTE -- AN ORGANIZATION WHICH EMPLOYS OVER FIVE HUNDRED SOCIAL SCIENTISTS ECONOMISTS MATHEMATICIANS DEMOGRAPHERS AND DATA SCIENTISTS. AND WITH MIDDLEMAN AN ACTUARIAL FIRM. TO MODEL THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FINANCING DESIGNS. BOB WALTER LEIGH THE MODELING RESULT RESULTS SHOWED THAT THERE WERE NO PERFECT FINANCING SOLUTIONS. IT DID PROVIDE CRITICAL AND VALUABLE INSIGHT ON WHAT FEATURES TO MAKE A FINANCING MECHANISM MORE IMPACTFUL -- INCLUDING ELEMENTS SUCH AS COST AND COVERAGE OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS. UNFORTUNATELY AS WE AS WE ANOTHER CONVERSATION OF HOW WE PAY FOR LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT -- HAS NOT BEEN PRIORITIZE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. I RECENTLY OTHER STATES SUCH AS HAWAII TEN IN MAINE. HAD BEGUN TO TAKE INITIATIVE TO WORK ON THEIR OWN STATEWIDE SOLUTIONS TO FINDING A SUSTAINABLE FINANCING MECHANISM. TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES FACING MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES IN CARING FOR THEIR AGING LOVED ONES. I WE LEAVE NOW THE TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO MOVE FOR WITH DEVELOPING OUR OWN SUSTAINABLE FINANCING MECHANISM. TO MEET THIS GROWING NEED -- JUST FOR CONTEXT CALIFORNIA HAS ALMOST EIGHT MILLION PERSONS WHO ARE EITHER A OLDER ADULTS PERSONS WITH MOBILITY SENSORY INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL AND OR MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES MANY OF WHOM STRUGGLE TO FOR THE SERVICES. AND SUPPORTS THE NEED TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY AND INDEPENDENCE. I NGUYEN INFORMAL NETWORKS OF CARE NOT AVAILABLE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR LONG TERM SERVICES FOR SELF FILL THE GAP. BUT THESE SERVICES BRING HIGH COSTS NOT ONLY TO THE INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY INVOLVED BUT ALSO TO THE TAXPAYERS IN THE GOVERNMENT. AS MORE INDIVIDUALS ARE FORCED TO SPEND DOWN ASSETS TO QUALIFY FOR AN ALREADY OVERBURDENED ACCOUNT SYSTEM. I'M SURE MOST INDIVIDUALS AWARE THAT MEDICARE DOES NOT COVER -- ADEQUATELY -- LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FINANCING HOURS ON COMPUTERS AND SUPPORTS. AND AS AS THIS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT TODAY WE KNOW THAT LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE -- BY AND LARGE IS RELATIVELY ON AFFORDABLE. OKAY I THINK YOU JUST USE THAT ALL THE TIME -- WELL THEN I WILL OUT PASSED ON TO TO MY CALL IS THAT OKAY. ALSO BE TALK HERE SO -- OUR ORGANIZATION IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE VARIOUS REASONS EXPRESS BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL THE SORT OF FISCAL CRUNCH ON THE AYE HSS PROGRAM. FAR TOO OFTEN WHEN INDIVIDUALS REACH THE AGE WHERE THEY NEED LONG TERM CARE -- THEY'RE FORCED TO SPEND DOWN INTO POVERTY TO QUALIFY FOR THE AGE OF SUCH PROGRAMS. AND IT IS AS IT STANDS NOW THE CURRENT FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR AYE HSS IS NOT. SUSTAINABLE -- WITH THE GROWING SENIOR POPULATION -- AND WE ALSO REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE VISION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE OUR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IMPOVERISH THEMSELVES -- SIMPLY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE CARE THAT THEY NEED IN THEIR CITING OF CHOICE WHICH IS OUR HOME. SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT CALIFORNIA FIND OF OF SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION TO THESE CHALLENGES FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO ARE CARING FOR THEMSELVES OR THEIR AGING AND DISABLED LOVED ONES. AND IT'S OUR POSITION AT LOCAL TWENTY FIFTEEN UNNECESSARY FIRST. MISTER CHAIR BOTH -- DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND AND AS A MEMBER OF CARE THAT WE SUPPORT THE REQUEST I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE QUICK POINT ON TOP OF THE THOROUGH DISCUSSION OF MY COLLEAGUES -- AND IS A PROGRAM I THINK YOU'RE BEGINNING TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER A KEY COMPONENT FOR THE US AND WHAT WE THINK WILL BE HAVING THE ACTUARIAL STUDY -- TO WILL SHOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IS -- REQUIRE -- THAT ANY PLAN THAT GOES FORWARD IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE HOMESTEAD ACT AND INSURING THAT WE'RE PROVIDING INDIVIDUALIZED PERSON CENTERED CARE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH -- ANY COMMENTS FROM DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. NO WE WE BEEN APPROACHED INVOLVED IN SOME INITIAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL IN LIGHT OF WHAT YOU HEARD IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MASTER PLAN CONVERSATION -- THERE MAY BE ROOM TO MAKE THAT A PRIORITY IN THE BUDGET OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT HELLO COMMENTS.

OUR MAIN APPROACH TO OUR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES HERE WHO CLEARLY THEY ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD TO SORT OF CARE TO START WITH IS TO TELL THEM THAT WELL YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY YOUR FAMILY THE POVERTY AND THEN THE STATE WILL STEP IN IS. NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT SOME OTHER OPTIONS AND I APPRECIATE -- YOU CHAMPING THIS I APPRECIATE THE INTEREST APARTMENT SCIAL SERVICES AND I THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT STUDY THAT NEEDS TO BEFORE SO THANKS FOR MUCH THANK YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT.

SO THEY MAY LIVE INDEPENDENTLY AS POSSIBLE AND WITH DIGNITY IN THEIR OWN HOMES A TEMPORARY OR ANNUAL RESTORATION OF THE 7% CUT. CREATES INSTABILITY IN THE LIVES OF CARE RECIPIENTS LIKE MY SON AND THEIR CARE PROVIDERS LIKE ME. NO SORT OF NSA CONFIDENCE AT THE PERCENT ON THE WHOLE THING OKAY I'M GUESSING IF YOU GOT THE NEW JUNGLE BUT A MONTH AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND EAGLE DO YOU MUST BUY LIST.

A CUT TO HIS HOURS PUTS US IN A UNSTABLE POSITION TO BOTH CONSUMERS LIVES. AND THE CARE BEING PROVIDED. ME YOU CALL NO. BUDGET. BUSINESSES SODAS I THINK YOUR LET'S BE LOOK ABOUT HOW WATER HI BUT YOU NEVER EVER THOUGHT OF HIM FOR A MINUTE. GET THE POSSIBLE GRASS YES. MY SON SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER HE WILL HAVE ENOUGH HOURS OF CARE SO TODAY I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT A TRUE PER MINUTE RESTORATION OF THE 7% CUT THANK YOU. THIS IS A I SHALL ROSY OF EVERYONE REPEAT WHAT THEY SAID LOT OF WHAT I WAS CONVINCED HER TO SAY TODAY OF WOULD BE REPEAT WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY. BUT I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD WEAR CARD WITH A PROPOSED A UNIQUE WAYS FOR MAKING SURE AYE HSS SERVICES ARE SUSTAINABLE AND TO THE FUTURE FOR THOSE WHO NEED A IT JUST SAYS. THERE'S NOT AN ALTERNATIVE TO USING AYE HSS THERE'S NOT A BETTER PROGRAM IN THE COMMUNITY THAT HELPS KEEP SENIORS THE BLIND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES MAINTAINED IN THE COMMUNITY. AS WITH THE SUPPORTS THEY NEED. I'M GLAD THE GOVERNOR SAYS HE FULLY SUPPORTS HIGH SHE SAYS BUT A ONE YEAR RESTORATION OF 7% CUT USING. GENERAL FRIENDS IS NOT ENOUGH WE NEED TO FIND A PERMANENT SOLUTION. YEAR AFTER YEAR WE'VE WE'VE COME BACK. IT IS FOR IT OF SUN BECAUSE WHEN I HAD THOSE CUTS IMPLEMENTED FOR ANY. OF I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THING ON THE LIST OF MY THINGS TO DO THAT. THAT THAT I WOULD HAVE TO CUT OUT WITH THOSE CUTS AND I DON'T EVER LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH -- ANY COMMENTS FROM. THE FARM SOCIAL SERVICES. OKAY -- LA -- ONCE FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ANY TALENT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE BUDGET DOES INCLUDE. THREE HUNDRED FOR A TWO POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND TO RESTORE THE 7% IN IS THE INTENT OF THE AMOUNT ADMINISTRATION FOR THIS RESTORATION TO BE ONGOING. WE HEAR THE CONCERNS WERE HAPPY TO CONTINUE ENGAGING CONVERSATIONS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO WE WILL HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I'M HAPPY TO KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION LEASES. PROPOSING IN SPIRITS AND IN NUMBERS TO DO THAT BUT I ALSO HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT. WE SHOULD HAVE OUR OUR CODE ACTUALLY REFLECT OR INTENT AS WELL OKAY ALL RIGHT. OKAY NEXT ITEM. IS -- IS THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY FOR MINISTRY TO FUNDING SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES -- I CARE YOU ARE OKAY WILL COME OKAY. SO PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD FOR BEING Q. MISTER TERRIBLY BC AND HAS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES FOR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR AGENDA USING THIS ISSUE -- WE FIRST WANT TO START BY EXPRESSING OUR APPRECIATION. FOR THE ON GOING DIALOGUE WE'VE BEEN HAVING WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- REGARDING WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT IN THE CURRENT PROPOSAL FOR PA ADMIN FUNDING -- WE ARE HOPEFULLY OPTIMISTIC THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THOSE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WILL PROVE FRUITFUL AND WILL COME TO A SHARED UNDERSTANDING ABOUT. THE NEED TO FULLY FUND PA ADMIN ON JUST TWO EXAMPLES I WANT TO GET OF OFTHE FUNDING METHODOLOGY THAT WE BELIEVE HAS PROVEN FAULTY. IN DETERMINING -- PA ADMIN FUNDING FOR THIS UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR -- FIRST OF ALL PLEASE PROVIDE A WIDE VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS -- INCLUDING YOU KNOW REGISTRIES REFERRAL SERVICES BACKGROUND CHECKS AT CETERA. SO AS IT RELATES TO BACKGROUND CHECK OLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF FULL TIME EMPLOYEES ALLOCATED FOR PERFORMING BACKGROUND CHECKS WAS BASED ON FORTY FIVE THOUSAND BACKGROUND CHECKS BEING DONE ANNUALLY -- THERE'S A REALLY LARGE TURNOVER RATE IN HSS ABOUT 30% SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE DOJ BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT WERE DONE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE NUMBER WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SO THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE THE R. FREIGHT -- AND SO THAT RELATED THAT VERSE THE RESULT OF IT -- BEING BASED ON FORTY FIVE THOUSAND WOULD RESULT IN ABOUT ONE AFTER HE FOR EVERY NINETY FIVE HUNDRED BACKGROUND CHECKS AND ONLY FOUR POINT. SEVEN FOUR FULL TIME EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE STATE TO DO THAT WHICH IS INSUFFICIENT THE SECOND EXAMPLE HAS TO DO WITH THE PROVIDER REGISTRY THAT WAS BASED ON ONLY. 8% OF THE CONSUMER CASELOAD WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN ONLY THIRTY SIX POINT SIXTY THREE OF T. E.'S ACROSS THE STATE AS WE HAVE FIFTY SIX PUBLIC AUTHORITIES THROUGHOUT. THE STATE THAT'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH FOR ONE PER SO WE AGAIN ARE VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE TO CONVINCE. EVERYBODY THAT WE NEED MORE MONEY THANK YOU. I THANK YOU -- COMES FROM THE FARM SOCIAL SERVICES. OKAY NO THAT'S RIGHT RIGHT LA -- FINANCE ALL RIGHT. OKAY WELL THANKS VERY MUCH AND STANDARDS ON GOING DISCUSSIONS SO HOPEFULLY THOSE SKETCHES OF PROVE FRUITFUL BY -- MAY. EXCELLENT. FINALLY WE HAVE THE TO LINK I JUST AS COUNTY ELOISE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- SO. YOU W. SEIU WELCOME -- SO I KNOW YOU'VE BOTH BEEN UP HERE BEFORE BUT LET'S INTRODUCE YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD FOR THIS PARTICULAR ITEM THANK YOU. IF ANYONE KNOWS THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA. HI CHRISTINE ABBAS HAMILTON YOU W. ASKS ME [inaudible] SO -- SO I'D BE GOING BEGIN THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR -- YOU W. REPRESENTS TWENTY ONE COUNTIES THE OF AYE HSS PROVIDERS I DISTRIBUTED TO THE COMMITTEE A GRAPH IT SHOULD BE THAT SHOWS YOU COLLECTIVE BARGAINING STATUS IN OUR TWENTY ONE COUNTIES. SO WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TODAY GIVING ATTENTION TO THE LONG TERM CARE CRISIS. I BELIEVE WHAT ARE PROPOSAL ADDRESSES IS ANOTHER LINK IN THAT CHAIN WHICH IS PROVIDER PAY. AND THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT RECRUIT AND WORK WHEN ALL YOU DO IS PAY THE MINIMUM WAGE. THEY CAN GO WORK ANY OTHER JOB THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS STRESSFUL AND LESS DIFFICULT. AND PROBABLY GET PAID MORE AND PROBABLY HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH BENEFITS. I JUST AS PROVIDERS AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE IN THE COUNTIES HIGHLIGHTED IN GREEN. WE ONLY HAVE SIX COUNTIES CURRENTLY OUT OF TWENTY ONE THAT PAY OVER MINIMUM WAGE. THE COUNTIES HIGHLIGHTED IN YELLOW ARE COUNTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS IN PLACE. AND SO YOU CAN SEE OUT OF THERE'S SIX ONLY SIX COUNTIES OUT OF TWENTY ONE HAVE AGREEMENTS CURRENTLY IN PLACE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT CALL AND YOU CAN SEE THE AVERAGE TIME SINKS SINCE THAT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN EXPIRED IS ALMOST THREE YEARS. AND THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE EIGHTY NEGOTIATED WAGE INCREASE OCCURRED IS CLOSEST TO FOR YEARS I WANT TO POINT OUT BECAUSE I REALIZE THIS AFTER I I PUT THE CHART TOGETHER. THAT. THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE FACT THAT MOST OF THOSE WAGE INCREASES THAT HAPPENS SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE COLUMN IN THE MIDDLE THAT SAYS LASTING INCREASE. MOST OF THOSE INCREASES WERE PURELY THE TRANSFER OF THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT WERE SPENT ON HEALTH BENEFITS. BEING PUT TOWARD WAGES SO THAT THERE WAS NO ACTUAL COST TO THAT AND THE REASON WHY THAT HAPPENED WAS THAT WAS WHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PASSED. AND MEDICAID EXPANSION HAPPENED WHICH MEANT WHICH MEANT THAT MOST OF THOSE WORKERS WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET ON TO MEDIC HAL. SO THE ONLY WAY THAT WE GOT THOSE INCREASES WAS BY TAKING MONEY OUT OF HEALTH BENEFITS. THE REASON I SPEAK SO PASSIONATELY ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSEWE HAVE TRIED OVER AND OVER IN THE BUDGET PROCESS TO INCENTIVIZE MOVEMENT. BY THE COUNTIES WHO WE BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY WITH AND SO THIS ISN'T TARGETING THE COUNTIES WHO HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING THIS IS TARGETING THE COUNTIES THAT ARE RECALCITRANT AND REFUSE. TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT BY THESE WORKERS BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DON'T SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. AND I'M GONNA GO BACK TO TWENTY TWELVE WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE STATE TO GET THE COMMITTEE FIRST CHOICE OPTION WHICH WAS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL DOLLARS. THAT WAS APPLIED RETROACTIVELY WHICH MEANT THAT EVERY COUNTY GOT A CHECK FOR THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT WAS REFUNDED BACK TO THEM WE BAG AT THE TIME FOR THOSE DOLLARS TO BE PUT RIGHT BACK INTO THE PROGRAM IN THE FORM OF WAGES AND BENEFITS AND THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. THE I. AGES AS MOE WHICH HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN STARTING IN TWENTY TWELVE MEANT THAT THE COUNTIES WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SPENDING IN THE PROGRAM. EXCEPT FOR THREE AND A HALF PERCENT GROWTH FACTOR. I DIDN'T RESULT IN ANY WAGE INCREASES I'M SORRY MR TRACK IS BIG ON THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT LET ME PASS IT ON TO MY COLLEAGUE IN TO SAY THAT WHAT WE'RE ASKING. FOR IS A COMMITMENT THAT THE SAVINGS THAT THEY WILL EXPERIENCE. WE'LL GO BACK INTO THE POCKET BOOKS OF THESE PROVIDERS THANK YOU. YOUR PASSION LAUGHTER WITH NO TIME BY LETTERS GO HEAD TO HEAD. BECAUSE TO BRIEFLY. ANYWAY IN WITH US THE ARE YOU THIRTY SEVEN COUNTIES CURRENTLY WE HAVE TWENTY THREE OF OUR THIRTY SEVEN COUNTIES WITHOUT A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THERE'S NO THERE'S NO RECOURSE -- OUR PROVIDERS CANNOT STRIKE SIMILAR TO PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS THERE'S NO BINDING ARBITRATION SO AT COUNTY CAN DECIDE THAT THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT AND AND BACHELORS OKAY THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN OTHER PROFESSIONS STATE EMPLOYEES TO HAVE A CONTRACT. THERE WOULD BE CONCERNED IF HOSPITALS DON'T HAVE A CONTRACT THERE WOULD BE CONCERN THE FACT THAT ARE AYE AGES AS PROVIDERS COULD NOT HAVE A CONTRACT FOR UPWARDS OF TEN YEARS. IS IS NOT OKAY AND THERE SHOULD BE CONCERNED IT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE GRAVELY CONCERNED -- WITH THIS CURRENT STATE WE HAVE ONE COUNTY AS LASSEN THEY HAVE NEVER HAD A CONTRACT THEY WENT TO MANDATORY MEDIATION AND IN MEDIATION IT WAS FOUND IN. FAVOR OF THE UNION AND THEY HAVE DISMISSED EVERYTHING SO NOT HAVING A CV EIGHT IS BASICALLY A DISMISSAL OF AYE AGE OF THOSE PROVIDERS IT'S A DISMISSAL OF THEIR CLIENTS IN A DISMISSAL OF THE PROGRAM AND ITS ENTIRETY. AND SO THAT'S WHY THIS PROPOSAL IS BEFORE YOU TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH CLEARLY A BIG PROBLEM. YEAH OF COMMENTS FROM THE PARTS OF SERVICE. NO I THINK THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE HEARING IS NOT A NEW -- ONE WE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S BEEN HISTORICAL UNCERTAINTY ON ON REGARDING WHETHER A BARGAINING WOULD BE MOVED TO THE STATE LEVEL -- AS WAS PROPOSED UNDER THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE INCREASES IN MINIMUM WAGE -- HAVE BEEN A FACTOR AND ALSO JUST THE GENERAL CONVERSATION AROUND THE AMMO IN FISCAL COMMITMENTS IN THE PROGRAM WE'RE NOT GOING CONCERNED AS CLEARLY COMPLICATED THE ABILITY TO REACH AGREEMENTS -- THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND CARE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE ALL HERE. FOR IS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE HAVING A STABLE WORKFORCE AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT KNOWN IN CERTAIN COMPENSATION FOR THAT WORK FORCE IS THEREFORE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT HEALTH CARE AND SAFETY. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LA -- ANY COMMENTS. FINANCE. ALL RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU. OKAY SO WELL WE'RE GOING TO NOW MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENTS ON AYE ON THIS PORTION OF AYE HSS SO WE WILL BE THEY'LL COVER THE OVERVIEW THE MAN IS FIVE FIRSTS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO THE B. C. P.. FOR THE MISTER VIEW DATA AND THE FIVE PROPOSALS FOR INVESTMENT. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ITEMS -- BUT ALSO LOTS BEEN SAID ABOUT THEM READY NOT THAT MARKET COULD BE BUT I'M GOING TO ASK IF YOU COULD SEE -- THESE AGAIN KEEP YOUR REMARKS TO A MINUTE BE TO USE WORK I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER AGREED WITH PEOPLE TESTIFIED WORKS -- TO SO THANK YOU AND Là. WELCOME. AFTER PAN IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CONNIE ARNOLD HERE AGAIN. A DISABILITY RIGHTSADVOCATE FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS. FIRST I AM HERE TO SAY THAT THE I JUST AS PROGRAM IS NO LONGER SERVING THE INTERESTS OF THOSE. OF US WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES TO SAY LIVING. AT IN OUR OWN HOMES IN THE COMMUNITY -- THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT THE I JUST SAYS. PUBLIC AUTHORITIES ARE IN EFFECTIVELY USELESS AND HELPING RECIPIENTS. TO FIND COMMUNITY CARE PROVIDERS BECAUSE AND WHAT I'M SAYING SPECIFICALLY MAY INVOLVE OTHER MULTIPLE COUNTIES BECAUSE I HEAR FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE. ONE THEY RECYCLED NAMES ON LISTS TWO THEY GIVE OUT VERY FEW PROVIDER NAMES TO CALL WHEN THERE'S RECIPIENT. CALLS IN FOR A LIST SOMETIMES FAR AWAY. THREE POTENTIAL COMMUNITY PROVIDERS DON'T WANT TO WORK FRIDAY JUST AS RECIPIENTS WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES ONE WAGES ARE LEVEL. LOWER THAN MCDONALD'S OR OTHER LOW WAGE JOBS -- WITH THE LAST TWO SPEAKERS -- NEW PROVIDER ENROLLMENT IS TOO SLOW AND REQUIRES A GOING THROUGH ITS LOW BACKGROUND CHECK PROCESS. I AGES SAYS TIME SHEETS ARE GIVEN OUT FOR WEEKS TO MONTHS FOR NEW PROVIDERS TO BE PAID. PAYMENT CAN BE DELAYED FOR MONTHS. ARE THERE IS NO LOW PAY DIFFERENTIAL FOR PROVIDERS WILLING TO WORK FOR PERSONS DEFINED IN LAW IS HAVING. A SEVERE DISABILITY WHERE THE AYE HSS RECIPIENT HAS TWO OR MORE. I IT JUST SAYS PROVIDERS WERE AT LEAST ONE IS A NON FAMILY MEMBER CARE PROVIDER OR MORE. THERE SHOULD BE ANNUAL PAY INCREASE INCENTIVES SMALL REYES FOR THOSE PROVIDERS WILLING TO WORK. AND PROVIDE CARE TO AYE HSS RECIPIENTS DESIGNATED AS HAVING A SEVERE DISABILITY. THIS DESIGNATION IS BASED ON LEVEL OF ASSESSED AYE HSS HOURS UNDER THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS COAT. EIGHT CDSS AYE HSS AND RECONCILED ADVANCE PAY I'M AND I HSS ADVANCE PAY RECIPIENTS. THERE OVER PAYMENT PROCESS IS UNCONSCIONABLE. HAS THE STATE AND COUNTY IS FAILING TO GET ONLY TIMELY PAPER TIME SHEETS. THEN TURN AROUND AND DEMAND A REFUND OF THE MONIES FOR ATTENDANT CARE THAT THE PERSON PAID OUT. TO THEIR PROVIDERS -- FROM THOSE OF US WITH THE MOST SEVERE DISABILITIES CURRENTLY THAT SITUATIONS GOING ON WITH A FRIEND IN LA. THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A FRIEND OF MINE WHO RUNS A NONPROFIT WHO IS A QUADRIPLEGIC IN. SANTA CRUZ CAN'T GET TIME SHEETS EVEN THOUGH HE'S CALLED THE HELP DESK CALL THESE. SOCIAL WORKER CALLED THE COUNTY THEY WON'T SEND HIM OR THE PROVIDER THE TIME SHEETS AND THEY'VE HAD HIM ALREADY PAID BACK MONEY [inaudible] AND AND NOW HE'S FACING IT A SECOND TIME HE CAN'T GET THE TIME SHEETS THAT'S WRONG THAT'S UNCONSCIONABLE. CDS AS PROPOSED DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN PARAMEDICAL SERVICES PROPOSED. CHANGES THAT WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR AYE AGES SAYS RECIPIENTS WHICH IS ABILITY TO GET PARAMEDICAL SERVICES. AND THEY'RE MAKING THE SYSTEM MORE PER YEAR CRADDICK. SO IF YOU NEED HER MEDICAL SERVICES THEY WANT YOU TO HAVE TO GO TO A LICENSED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. TO GET TWO FORMS FILLED OUT NOW AND GET TRAINING AND SIGN OFF ON IT FOR WHAT. THE PROVIDER CAN BE PAID TO PROVIDE A CATHETER CHANGE A FEEDING -- TO RANGE OF MOTION THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND THE PRIORITY NEEDS TO SHIP TO THE THIRTY PER 2% OF US THAT NEED. A COMMUNITY PROVIDERS WE REALLY THOSE COMMUNITY PROVIDERS ARE NOT BENEFITING FROM THE OVER TIME. AND WE APPRECIATE ALL THAT IS BEING DONE FOR THE FAMILY MEMBER PROVIDERS BUT WHEN WE CAN'T FIND IT. WERE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO END UP IT'S OUR DEBT I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. I HAVE A HOUSE AND I KNOW I'M GOING TO END UP IN A NURSING HOME THE WAIT THE SYSTEM IS. SET UP IN A FIGHT.

AND CERTAINLY IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT ANY VV I UNDERSTAND THAT'S ALSO POSITION TO TAKE -- BUT I'M HEARING SOME. ASPECTS OF TV THAT'S NOT WHAT'S. DVD CURRENTLY IS IN FACT WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS TO CODIFY THE KIND OF PRINCIPLES AND CHANGES. THAT THE THE PART SOCIAL SERVICES ACT DOING SO -- IF I MAY ASK THE PART JUST BEGAN. TWO WEEKS TO HELP OF BE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT WHAT IS. EVEY EXPECTING PEOPLE TO DO -- A HEARING THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE HAVING SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT CHECKING IN CHECKING OUT OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT HAVE TO DO. FOR THEM IN ORDER TO BE SURE THAT THEY GET THEIR BENEFITS. SO THE IN THE DESIGNED THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE. FOR THE V. V. THERE IS NO CHECK IN OR CHECK OUT REQUIREMENTS THIS THE FEDERAL STATUTE REQUIRES US TO COLLECT INFORMATION OF START TIME IN AND TIME. SO WHEN THE TIME SHEET IS COMPLETED. YOU'LL FILL OUT YOUR START TIME IN AND TIME YOU'RE NOT CHECKING IN AND CHECKING OUT IN REAL TIME. SO AT THE END OF THE PAY PERIOD OR AT WHATEVER. INTERVALS YOU CHOOSE TO FILL OUT -- THE INFORMATION OR PROVIDE THE INFORMATION IS YOU'RE GETTING GIVE THOSE ADDITIONAL PIECES OF INFORMATION BUT YOU'RE NOT STOPPING OR STARTING AS YOU AS YOU ACTUALLY DO THE CHECK IN OR CHECK OUT -- FROM THE WORK THAT'S NOT THE CASE I'VE ALSO HEARD A COUPLE OF CONCERNS AROUND -- INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE ABLE -- TO DO THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY SIMILAR TO I WOULD IMAGINE TODAY THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO SIGN TIME SHEETS PERHAPS -- IF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RECIPIENTS ARE IN THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS THEN IT JUST LIKE TODAY. A CONSERVATIVE OR A GUARDIAN APPARENT. AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE CAN DO THAT ACTIVITY ON THEIR BEHALF ELECTRONICALLY THE SAME AS THEY WOULD IN PAPER TODAY. THE CLEAR FIVE BECAUSE I THINK MANY OF THEM ARE FAMILY CARE GIVERS WHAT HAPPENS IS THEIR GUARDIAN IS ALSO IN THE IHS AS CARE GIVERS CAN THEY SIGN OFF ON THAT OR NOT I MEAN. SO IF THEY HAVE LEGAL AUTHORITIES OF THEIR THE CONSERVATOR THE PARENT OF A MINOR. THEN THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT ON THEIR BEHALF EVEN IF THEY ARE THE PROVIDER ALSO JUST LIKE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT WITH THE TIME SHE TODAY. OKAY SO I JUST WANNA BE SURE WERE YOU CAN ADD A CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDS SOMEONE SAYS BOOK I STILL DON'T LIKE IT I OPPOSE -- BUT I JUST WANNA BE SURE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME. BUT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE TALKING WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING AND AND THE PROPOSAL IS ACTUALLY TO CODIFY. THESE PRINCIPLES SO THAT WE DON'T GO TO X. I KNOW THERE WAS A PREVIOUS PROPOSAL THE I THINK IT WAS A YEAR A YEAR AGO OR SO THAT BORDER WAS IN THE CHECK IN CHECK OUT WHICH WE REJECTED.
