GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND GAS IT GIVES ME TREMENDOUS PRIDE AND HONOR TO ADVISE ON BEHALF OF THE LGBT Q. LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS TO PRESENT HR FORTY ONE WHICH DECLARES JUNE TO BE PRIDE MONTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EACH YEAR JUNE MARKS THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE STONEWALL UPRISING THEY GAVE BIRTH TO THE MODERN LGBT Q. CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT INDEED THIS IS OUR FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THAT RIGHT IN NEW YORK CITY THEY GAVE SO MANY OF US THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE OUT CELLS OUT. PROUD IN FULL -- IN FULL JOINED THAT OF OUR RIGHTS. THERE'S A STATE WITH AS MANY BLESSINGS AS WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT DIVERSITY IS AMOUNTS OUR GREATEST BLESSINGS. TODAY THE LEGISLATORS NATURE WITH THE LEGISLATURE IS REPRESENTED BY THE LARGEST LGBTQ CAUCUS IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE COMPRISED OF EIGHT OPENLY LGBT Q. MEMBERS INCLUDING ONE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER THE FIRST IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. THIS COMMUNITY HAS COME SUCH A VERY VERY LONG WAY AND WHAT SEEMS OFTEN LIKE A RELATIVELY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. IT WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO THE DEBATES ON THIS FLOOR WITH THE OUTCOMES WERE NEVER CERTAIN IN OFTEN WERE NOT POSITIVE. IN FACT IT WAS JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN VOTERS A CALIFORNIA WENT TO THE BALLOT IN PASSED PROPOSITION EIGHT TO NINE MANY OF US THE RIGHT TO MARRY. WHILE THE OUTCOME OF THAT WAS EVENTUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN LOVE DID IN FACT WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES IN THE COMMUNITY. AND WHILE WE REJOICE IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN SUPREME COURT DECISION TO GRANTED US MARRIAGE EQUALITY WE KNOW THAT OUR RIGHTS ARE FAR FROM ONE IN THERE TO IN TOTALITY. IN FACT FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT SUGGEST THAT OUR MOVEMENT HAS ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING IT MUST ACCOMPLISH THAT IS FAR FROM THE TRUTH. IN FACT JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THE SUPREME COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF A BAKER WHO REFUSED TO SELL A CAKE TO A LESBIAN COUPLE SEEKING TO GET MARRIED. MEMBERS THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN HAS REPORTED THAT AT LEAST TEN TRANSGENDER WOMEN. HAVE BEEN VIOLENTLY MURDERED IN OUR NATION IN. TWENTY NINETEEN ALL OF THESE WOMEN ARE BLACK. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE FOR SO MUCH OF OUR MOVEMENT THERE CONTINUES TO BE VIOLENCE AND DISCRIMINATION PARTICULARLY AGAINST OUR TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND MISTER SPEAKER I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO READ THEIR NAMES ALLOWED BECAUSE YOU MUST KNOW THEIR NAMES TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE STREETS. AND IN THE COMMUNITIES NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE NATION DANA MARTIN. DOESN'T MEAN WHERE A SHANTI CAMERON CLEAR LEGADO. MALAYSIA BOOKER TO ME GO WASHINGTON PARIS CAMERON. CHINA OUT LENZI. CHANEL SCURLOCK INS ALWAYS SPEARS. ALL CHANGE GENDER BLACK WOMEN ALL MURDERED ALL IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS. THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES THAT CONTINUE TO FACE OUR COMMUNITY. AND I LEGISLATIVE LGBT CAUCUS WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP CALIFORNIA ON THE LEADING EDGE OF A QUALITY WHEN IT COMES TO CREATE PEOPLE. AND WE APPRECIATE THE SOLIDARITY TO SO MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN STANDING WITH US IN THIS ONGOING STRUGGLE. MEMBERS TODAY WE ARE HONORING SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE THE PROGRESS IN THE STATE POSSIBLE. THERE ADVOCATE EIGHT PEOPLE WHO'VE CONTINUE TO FIGHT AN ADVOCATE FOR EQUAL RIGHTS. THERE LGBT Q. ACTIVISTS ARTISTS CULINARY EXPERTS ELECTED OFFICIALS. BUSINESS LEADERS COMMUNITY LEADERS. AND EVEN AN ATHLETE. THAT'S SURPRISING FOR SOME OF US. THEY COME FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. AND WE ARE SO VERY PROUD TO HAVE THEM HERE IN THE CAPITAL TODAY TO HONOR THEM. IN MEMBERS ON YOUR DESKS YOU'LL NOTICE A BAG WITH A LAPEL PIN. AND A NOTE. APPEAR VITA BRACELET FOR WHICH BENEFIT SAN DIEGO'S LGBT PRIDE CELEBRATION. MEMBERS I WANT TO END WITH THIS NOTE. 40% OF HOMELESS YOUTH. IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ. AND THIS YEAR THE CAUCUS HAS PURCHASED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BACKPACKS. STARTING TODAY WILL BEGIN ACCEPTING DONATIONS TO FILL THESE BACKPACKS WITH THE ESSENTIAL NEEDS FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. WHO ARE LIVING WITHOUT SHELTER OFTEN BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE? SO WE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CELEBRATE BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT PRIDE IS. BUT WE NEVER EVER FORGET THAT THIS MOVEMENT STARTED IN A VERY DARK PLACE AFTER YEARS OF OPPRESSION MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY NO LONGER WILLING TO TAKE IT STANDING UP SPEAKING OUT ACTING OUT. AND AND AS A RESULT AND DEVELOPING AND ACQUIRING. MORE RIGHTS MORE RESPONSIBILITIES MORE EQUALITY. I STAND HERE TODAY PROUD TO BE INTRODUCED H. R. FORTY ONE TO DECLARE PRIDE MONTH IN CALIFORNIA. AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL JOIN ME IN DOING SO NOT JUST HERE TODAY WITH YOUR VOTE. BUT IN YOUR HOME COMMUNITIES MANY OF THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE LIKE ME STILL STRUGGLE TO BE WHO THEY ARE. WITH THE KIND OF DIGNITY THAT THEY DESERVE AS CALIFORNIANS. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE MISTER SPEAKER WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE ASSET THE FIRST WILL BE OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS GLORIA MISTER BONTA S. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN A PROUD CO AUTHOR I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR. FORTY ONE FOR LGBT Q. PEOPLE COMING OUT IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP AND WE'VE BEEN. LIVING FREE LEE AND AUTHENTICALLY. ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE LACK TEEN ACTS COMMUNITY. HOW DO WE TAKE HERE WATCHING NEXT HERITAGE CAN BE TRACED BACK TO PRE COLUMBIAN TIMES IN MEXICO THERE'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD A LONG HISTORY OF RECOGNIZING? MACHE PEOPLE OR YOUNG PEOPLE ASSIGNED MALE AT BIRTH WHO EMBRACE IDENTITIES AS FEMALE OR NON BINARY. MACHE INDIVIDUALS ARE OFTEN CELEBRATED AS CORNERSTONES OF OUR COMMUNITY. SAME SEX RELATIONS ARE WELL DOCUMENTED IN THE MAYAN CIVILIZATION ENCOMPASSING WHAT WE KNOW TODAY IS PORTIONS OF MEDICAL. WHAT A MAILLET BILLY'S HONDURAS AND EL SALVADOR ESPECIALLY IN RITUALS AND OTHER CEREMONIES? TODAY THE LATINO POPULATION MAKES A THIRTY NINE POINT 3% OF CALIFORNIANS AND ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN ADVANCING LGBTQ EQUALITY THE LGBT Q. IN THE WATCHING ACTS COMMUNITY ST STILL FACE. TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES RELATED TO IMMIGRATION. LANGUAGE ACCESS BARRIERS VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT AND HIV AND HEALTH INEQUITY. THANKFULLY CALIFORNIA IS IN RICH WITH PASSIONATE AND DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS THAT PROVIDE REGIONAL SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE BROWN BOY PROJECT IN EAST BAY. AND TO REVOLUTION IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WERE ESTABLISHED TO PROMOTE EQUALITY IN ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WHO SEEK SUPPORT AND LOVE AND ACCEPTANCE. THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE LGBT Q. AND THE WATCHING NEXT COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO BE A VITAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND IDENTITY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY ON H. R.. FORTY ONE THANK YOU MISTER MANTAS. MISTER DAVID CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES AS CHAIR OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR FORTY ONE IN CELEBRATION OF PRIDE MONTH. THIS YEAR'S PRIDE CELEBRATION MARKS THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE STONEWALL RIOTS. HOWEVER THREE YEARS BEFORE STONEWALL THIS MOVEMENT WAS ALREADY TAKING SHAPE IN PART BECAUSE OF AN API TRANS GENDER ACTIVISTS. IN THE TENDERLOIN NEIGHBORHOOD OF MY DISTRICT IN SAN FRANCISCO. SIMILAR TO STONE WALL. TAMERA CHING WAS INVOLVED IN A REVOLT AGAINST POLICE HARASSMENT. WHEN POLICE ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE HER AND OTHERS FROM A LOCAL RESTAURANT? COMPTON'S CAFETERIA CHAOS ERUPTED. THIS EVENT RESULTED IN ESTABLISHING TRANSGENDER ADVOCACY PROGRAMS WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO'S POLICE DEPARTMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND BEYOND. ANOTHER PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR LGBT Q. HISTORY ALSO INVOLVED AN ASIAN AMERICAN ACTIVISTS. WHILE SERVING IN THE US ARMY LIEUTENANT DAN CHOI CAME OUT ON NATIONAL TELEVISION WHEN CHALLENGING. DON'T ASK DON'T TELL. HIS ACTIVISM RESULTED IN THE REPEAL OF THIS DISCRIMINATORY POLICY. JUST REMEMBER THE ACTIONS OF DAN. AND TAMERA AND COUNTLESS OTHER BRAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE FOUGHT FOR QUALITY AND JUSTICE BY SUPPORTING HR FORTY ONE TO CELEBRATE OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY. THANK YOU MISS CHIU DOCTOR WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR FORTY ONE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA. LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS WE CELEBRATE THIS MONTH CALL PRIDE. THE STORY OF LGBT AMERICANS HAS BEEN ONE OF MARGINALIZATION DISCRIMINATION AND THE STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY AND EQUALITY. AFRICAN AMERICANS RECOGNIZE THOSE STRUGGLES IN THOSE VOICES THAT ARE TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED FROM HISTORY. THE BLACK LGBT MEMBER HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY LONG BEFORE STONE WALL. AND YET THEY WERE PRESIDENT STONE WALL MARCIA JOHNSON WAS A TRANSGENDER RIGHTS ACTIVIST WAS ONE OF THE PROMINENT FIGURES. OF THE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE STONEWALL RIOT FIFTY YEARS AGO. IT IS INTERESTING THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR RIGHTS AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO SECURE THEM. WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO TALK ABOUT THE FAMOUS PEOPLE WE TALK ABOUT AUDRE LORDE AND JAMES BALDWIN AND BAYARD RUSTIN AND BARBARA SMITH AND PHIL WILSON. ALL OF THOS IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE STRUGGLE. BUT SOMETIMES WE FORGET THOSE WERE NOT THE ACTIVISTS IN TERMS OF THE FOREFRONT BUT THOSE WHO JUST EVERY DAY LGBT PEOPLE TRYING TO LIVE THEIR LIVES. TRYING TO BASICALLY BE HAPPY IN WHO THEY ARE. I'VE HAD A NUMBER OF L. G. B. T. MEMBERS WHO WERE MY STUDENTS AND MY COLLEAGUES. AND WATCH THEM STRUGGLED NOT ONLY ON BEING JUST L. G. B. T.. BUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY FIT IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN THE BLACK CHURCHES IN THE BLACK SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS. AND OFTENTIMES THEY SUFFER A DOUBLE IF NOT A TRIPLE WHAMMY EVERY NOW AND THEN IF THEY'RE FEMALE IF THEY'RE BLACK AND THEIR L. G. B. T.. IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND TO BE A PART OF A COMMUNITY. I'VE SEEN SO MANY OF MY FRIENDS WHO ARE REALLY TORN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COME OUT OR THEY DON'T FEEL THEY CAN OR IF THEY DO COME OUT. THEY FEEL THEY WILL LOSE THE LOVE AND RESPECT. OF THE FOLKS WHO CARE ABOUT THEM. ONE OF THE MOST TRAGIC EXPERIENCES I HAD WAS WHEN I LOST ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES A VERY GOOD FRIEND DR DANI SCARBOROUGH. WAS A DANCER AT SAN DIEGO STATE ONE OF MY FACULTY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES SOMEONE THAT I LOVE DEARLY THAT MY CHILDREN CONSIDERED THE GODFATHER. AND THEY LOVED HIM DEARLY AND HE WAS A HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST VICTIMS OF AIDS. IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE EVEN DESPITE ALL OF THE CARE THAT WE HAVE FOR HIM. HE WAS SO AFRAID THAT SOMEONE WOULD KNOW THAT HE WAS GAY. WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE WE ALL KNEW HE WAS GAY. AND IT WAS KIND OF A LARRY IS WHEN HE CAME OUT AND SAID YOU KNOW I HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE. AND I SAID YOU MEAN YOU STRAIGHT OUT WE WAS JUST SHOCKED BECAUSE WE ALL KNEW HE WAS GAY. BUT THE FEAR THAT HE WOULD THAT WE WOULD REJECT HIM. EVEN AT THIS DIFFICULT TIME WAS UNEMPLOYED JUST AMAZING TO ALL OF US ALL OF HIS STUDENTS IN THE COLLEAGUES IN WHO LOVED HIM SO DEARLY. AND THE FEAR THAT WE WOULD REJECT HIM IF WE KNEW HE WAS GAY AND YET EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM SAYS I'M TRULY GAY I AM WONDERFUL AND EVERYONE LOVED IMPORT. SO I OFTEN THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH WE MISS AS A COMMUNITY. BECAUSE WE OFTENTIMES DON'T LET PEOPLE BASICALLY RELAX AND TO BE THEMSELVES AND BE ACCEPTED. AN ETHNIC COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFICULTY DEALING WITH THE LGBT COMMUNITY WOULD WE DON'T WE DON'T WE US ALMOST AS IFTO SAY. I WON'T ASK AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL AND WE'LL ALL BE OKAY. AND YET WE ALL AREN'T OKAY. SO IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS THAT THE THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SUFFER SO SEVERELY. IT WOULD HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY DON'T FIT IN WITH -- THE WHAT THE LGBT COMMUNITY THAT'S PREDOMINANTLY WHITE THEY DON'T FIT AND CULTURALLY THAT'LL FIT IN IN MANY WAYS AND SO THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO FIND THEIR OWN IDENTITY. AND SOMETIMES OWN COMMUNITY DEMANDS THAT THEY NOT BE FULL EXPRESSIVE OF WHO THEY ARE. IT IS INTERESTING TO ME THAT THE BLACK LG P. L. G. B. T. COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO SUFFER. THE SEVEREST FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION IN TERMS OF IT YOU JUST HEARD THE ONLY SEVEN INDIVIDUALS KILL THIS YEAR WHO TRANS GENDER ALL BLACK WOMEN. UNBELIEVABLE THAT THAT EXIST AND YET IT IS NOT THE FANFARE AND IS NOT WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF THINGS THAT DON'T UPSET US A LOT. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE STILL SUFFERING WITH WITH AIDS AND NOT GETTING THE CARE THAT THEY NEED? IT IS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY WHEN ONE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES A FEW YEARS AGO WAS ASK ABOUT. BUT AIDS IN BLACK COMMUNITIES HE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT AFRICA AND SOMEONE SAYS NO NO NO I'M TALKING ABOUT WASHINGTON DC I'M TALKING ABOUT NEW YORK I'M TALKING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES. AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE HIGH NUMBERS OF ALL OF THE NEW INCIDENTS ARE BASICALLY IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ISSUES ARE ISSUES FOR ALL OF US. THAT WE NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN SO I STAND TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS THAT HAS BEGUN TO ISSUE WOULD DEAL WITH ISSUES OF HIV IN BLACK COMMUNITIES IN OTHER PLACES. TO SAY THAT IT IS TIME NOW THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY STEP UP AND RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT ALL OF OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS ALL OF THOSE WERE PART OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND THAT INCLUDES THOSE OF COLOR. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I ASK THAT YOU STRONGLY SUPPORT HR FORTY ONE THAT HERE TODAY BUT YOU ALSO GIVE SPACE FOR OUR FOLKS TO BE PROUD OF WHO THEY ARE. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PRIDE MONTH IS ALL ABOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I VOTE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER MR GABRIEL. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS OF ACR NINETY NINE IN RECOGNITION ALSO OF EL TO BE PRIDE MONTH IS A RESOLUTION. CONDEMNING CONVERSION THERAPY AS MANY OF YOU MAY RECALL IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR WE HAD A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THERE IS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE TO QUALIFY CONVERSION THERAPY. AS WHAT IT IS A FRAUDULENT PRACTICE AT THE SAME TIME IT BECAME READILY. OUT THAT A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WERE IN OPPOSITION THAT FELT THAT THIS WOULD BAN THE BIBLE AND AS SUBSEQUENTLY TO THAT -- TYPE OF RHETORIC I FIND MYSELF VISITING A NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES DISTRICTS. INCLUDING THE MEMBER REPRESENTING THOUSAND OAKS THE MEMBER REPRESENTING ST BERNARD YOU KNOW THE MEMBER REPRESENTING CONCORD AND PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS WERE SUCH THAT. I FOUND THAT THERE WAS AN UNLIKELY ALLY SHIP THAT WAS RECOGNIZE WITH RESPECT TO KERN VERSION THERAPY IN FACT THE LEADERS THAT I MET WITH. ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INDIVIDUALS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY. SHOULD BE LOVED AND CELEBRATED AS WHO THEY ARE AND THAT CONVERSION THERAPY. WAS A FRAUDULENT PRACTICE AND A PERMISSION TO READ MISTER SPEAKER. WITHOUT OBJECTION. IN FACT PART OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. WERE SO FRUITFUL THAT. THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL EVANGELICAL ASSOCIATION PENNED AN OP ED IN THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER. STATING THAT REPAIRED IF THEY'RE P. IS WITHOUT EVIDENCE AS TO ITS EFFICACY IT IS INCONSISTENT WITH CHRISTIAN LIVING. WE SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION TO THIS PRACTICE THAT CAUSES HARM TO THESE INDIVIDUALS THIS IS CONTRARY TO THE NATURE OF THE CHRISTIAN MESSAGE. WHICH WHILE CALLING FOR CHANGE IN ALL PEOPLE TO BE ORIENTED TOWARDS CHRIST EVEN AT GREAT SACRIFICE NEITHER FAVORS NOR SUPPORTS ANY PRACTICE THAT CAUSES ANY HARM. MEMBERS THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE US IS A SIMPLE RECOGNITION THAT MEMBERS OF THE LGB COMMUNITY SHOULD BE LOVED AND CELEBRATED AS WHO THEY ARE. BUT IN FACT THIS IS ALSO A CULMINATION TO ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS ENJOYS WIDE SUPPORT WITH IT WITHIN THE EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY. WE FOUND THAT OFTENTIMES WE WOULD FIND THAT THE LGBT COMMUNITY WOULD BE AT ODDS WITH THAT OF EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN LEADERS BUT WE WE HAVE BEFORE US HERE TODAY. IS A CULMINATION OF THE HARD WORK AND RECOGNIZING THAT ALL THREE OF CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE RECOGNIZEDAS WHO THEY ARE AND AND BRACED -- AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THEY WERE SLOW MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER GOOD AFTERNOON COLLEAGUES I LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SILICON VALLEY FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL I STAND AS A PROUD. CO AUTHOR I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND HIM FOR HIS WORK TO FACILITATE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND CHRISTIAN LEADERS. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THIS RESOLUTION. YOU KNOW I'M SURE THAT MANY OF US CELEBRATED PRIDE MONTH -- BY PARTICIPATING IN LOCAL PARADES AND THE COLORS AND THE GLITTER. AND THE DANCE MUSIC WE'RE ALL FINE BUT HOPEFULLY WE SAW. A KALEIDOSCOPIC REPRESENTATION. OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY. IN SIZES IN AGES AND RACES AND ETHNICITIES. AND PROBABLY WE SAW [inaudible] HOPE [inaudible] LOVE [inaudible] SADNESS STRENGTH. RESILIENCE AND DETERMINATION. IN THEIR EYES. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR ONE OF THE VERY FIRST VOTE THAT I TOOK ON THIS FLOOR WAS ON CONVERSION THERAPY. AND I HADN'T BEEN HERE THAT LONG. AND I WAS ACTUALLY AGHAST THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE STILL TALKING ABOUT. AND I REMEMBER SHARING THIS AT BATH SHYING A LOCAL SYNAGOGUE IN MY COMMUNITY IT IS THE FIRST LGBT -- Q. SYNAGOGUE FOUNDED IN THE WORLD. I SHARED THIS WITH OUR MEMBERS IN ATTENDANCE. AND WAS RETURNED. WITH SADNESS AND GAS THAT THIS IN FACT WAS SOMETHING. THAT WE WERE STILL TALKING ABOUT. AS WE CONTINUE TO GRAPPLE WITH ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WE KNOW THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCHIS NOW STARTING TO OPERATE MORE AND MORE HOSPITALS. THAT IS GREAT BECAUSE THAT IS TALKING ABOUT HAVING GREATER ACCESS TO CARE. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHICH OPERATING THOSE HOSPITALS. THEY WILL BE SHARING A VERY PRESCRIPTIVE VALUE SYSTEM. THAT HAS BEEN RESTRICTIVE TOWARDS AND BIASED AGAINST WOMEN AND MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY. AS WE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO FIND COMPASSION AND LOVE AND EMPATHY WITH HOW WE COMMUNICATE. WITH OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND OUR FRIENDS. LET'S THINK ABOUT THE WORDS THAT ARE IN THIS RESOLUTION AND NO. THAT THE LIVES OF OUR LGBT Q. FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS ARE IMPORTANT. AT THE EQUAL AND EQUITABLE AND FAIR TREATMENT OF OUR LGBT Q. FAMILY FRIENDS. FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS. ARE IMPORTANT. AND LET'S NOT JUST CELEBRATE ON A DAY AND THEN GO ON ABOUT OUR BUSINESS. SCHERING SHAME AND TOLERANCE AND RESENTMENT. BECAUSE I'M SURE MANY OF US HAVE HAD TO FACE THE SAME KIND OF GOOD DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES AND FEELINGS THAT WE KNOW. OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND OUR FRIENDS IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY HAVE EXPERIENCED. I WANT TO SHARE THAT -- MY COUSIN COUSIN BUZZY. LONG AGO -- HE WAS A FLIGHT ATTENDANT AND LIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO AND HE WAS GAY. AND I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GAY. I'M BECAUSE I WAS TOO LITTLE AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. BUT WHAT I DID NOTICE WAS THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME AROUND ALL OF THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY. WOULD RUSH TO MAKE SURE THAT HE HAD WHAT HE NEEDED WOULD EMBRACE HIM WOULD HANG WITH HIM AND WOULD MAKE SURE THAT HE HAD THE LOVE AND SUPPORT THAT HE NEEDED. AND WHAT I REALIZED LATER ON WAS. IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS GAY. AND HE HAD BEEN ERASED. FROM OUR FAMILY TREE. BY HIS FATHER SOMEONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANT. TO HAVE AND LOVE BLACKS OUT. BUT HE DIED YEARS LATER FROM COMPLICATIONS OF AIDS. BUT HE ALSO DIED OF A BROKEN HEART. AND THAT IS WHAT THIS RESOLUTION AND WHAT PRIDE MONTH FIGHTS AGAINST. SO AS ASSIST WOMAN. AS AN ALLY TO THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON ACR. NINETY NINE THANK YOU MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE [inaudible] MISS FRIEDMAN [inaudible] YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS. IN SUPPORT OF RESOLUTION AND ACR NINETY NINE AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- SPEAKING ON THIS RESOLUTION. I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT FOR MANY OF US BECAUSE THE VERY PRACTICE OF CONVERSION THERAPY WHICH STILL HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA. GOES TO THE HEART. OF THE DISCRIMINATION THAT HAS BEEN HOUNDING LGBT PEOPLE T. TO PERPETUATE THE IDEA BUT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS TO BE OR CAN BE CURED. CONTINUES THE CYCLE OF SHAME. OF THE NILE. A DISCRIMINATION AND IN MANY CASES OF VIOLENCE. THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS. HOW WE JUST WENT THROUGH A VERY JOYOUS CEREMONY WERE REAL WE WERE ABLE TO HONOR PEOPLE? WHO HAVE BEEN EXCEPTIONAL CONTRIBUTORS? TO OUR STATE. AND THEIR CONTRIBUTORS NOT IN SPITE OF WHERE THEY FALL ON THE GENDER SPECTRUM. BUT BECAUSE OF IT [inaudible] AND TO HAVE THE IDEA THAT THAT PART OF THEM SHOULD BE A RACE OR DENIED. WHATEVER ROBBED US OF THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS MADE. WATCHING THE CEREMONY I WAS THINKING BACK TO WHEN I WAS YOUNG. MY VERY BEST FRIEND GROWING UP. WHEN I WAS A GIRL? WAS A LESBIAN NOW. NONE OF US SPOKE OF THAT NONE OF US REALLY KNEW I MEAN. THIS WAS FLORIDA THIS WAS MANY YEARS AGO. WHEN I WENT? TO MY HIGH SCHOOL. HOMECOMING DANCE IS A SENIOR. THE BOY THAT I TOOK TO THE DANCE WAS GAY. AGAIN NOTHING THAT WAS SPOKEN BUT WE KNOW. WE KNOW THAT NOTHING WILL COME OF THAT NIGHT BEYOND FRIENDSHIP. BUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS AND WHAT THEIR LIVES MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE AT THAT TIME. TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE LIVING A LIE. AND TO BE AFRAID OF BEING EXPOSED TO BE SO AFRAID THAT THEY HAD TO DATE. IN MY CASE A GIRL. MY GIRLFRIEND'S CASE BOYS. WHEN THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE LAST PERSON THEY WANTED TO BE DATING? AND TO THINK THAT ON TOP OF THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HAVE TOLD THEM THAT THEY COULD BE CURED. AS THOUGH THEY HAD SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM. AND WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT TO THEM. AND THAT'S TE HORROR THAT WE STILL PUT PEOPLE THROUGH TODAY. AND THERE'S SOMETHING SO FUNDAMENTALLY. GROSS ABOUT THAT. AND SAD ABOUT THAT. SO I WANT TO AGAIN APPLAUD. THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM SILICON VALLEY'S EFFORTS TO END THIS PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND A WAY [inaudible] TWO HAVE PEOPLE REALIZE THAT NOT ONLY SHOULD THEY SUBJECT THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS TO CONVERSION THERAPY. BUT THAT THEY SHOULD. WHEN THEY HEAR ABOUT IT SAY OH MY GOD IS THAT A BORING PRACTICE STILL HAPPEN? IN OUR MIDST. THANK YOU AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE. NAME IS FRIEDMAN MIS RACE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SO I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR. NINETY NINE AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SILICON VALLEY FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. WHEN WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY LAST YEAR TO VOTE [inaudible] ON LEGISLATION. MY COLLEAGUE WENT TO MY COMMUNITY TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. AND I APPRECIATED SO MUCH. NOT ONLY HIS WILLINGNESS TO COME TO THE COMMUNITY. BUT ALSO THE LEADER'S WILLINGNESS TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION. WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH. INTEREST IN PROTECTING VULNERABLE CITIZENS DECEPTIVE. PRACTICES [inaudible] CONVERSION THERAPY. IS ONE OF THOSE PRACTICES. AND TO BE CLEAR IT'S PROVEN TO BE AN UNETHICAL AND ULTIMATELY HARMFUL. BEING LGBT Q. IS NOT A DISEASE. IT'S NOT A DISORDER IS NOT AN ILLNESS THAT NEEDS TO BE CURED. I SUPPORT MY COLLEAGUES CALL FOR THE EQUITABLE TREATMENT. OF ALL PEOPLE. PROMOTION OF THE IDEA THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY CAN OR SHOULD BE CHANGED DOES NOT DEMONSTRATE THE BASIC RESPECT. THAT WE SHOULD SHOW ALL PEOPLE. REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY CHOOSE TO LOVE. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASPIRIN AYE VOTE. THANK ADDRESS MISS KOREA YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RIGHTS AND PROUD SUPPORT IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LET THE NO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. IN SUPPORT OF ACR NINETY NINE A RESOLUTION THAT EMBRACES THE DIVERSITY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. FOR FAR TOO LONG OUR LGBT COMMUNITY HAS BEEN REGULATED RELEGATED TO SHADOWS IN CLOSETS FEARING SOCIAL STIGMA AND PERSECUTION. FOR BEING WHO THEY ARE. STATE MY HAS FOSTERED DAMAGING PRACTICES LIKE CONVERSION THERAPY. WHICH TEACHES LGBTQ PEOPLE TO RESENT THEIR AUTHENTIC AND BEAUTIFUL IDENTITIES LABELING THEM AS PEOPLE WHO NEED TO CHANGE. NOT ONLY DO THESE PRACTICES CAUSE HARM TO THE LGBT Q. INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO A LARGER CULTURE OF INJUSTICE. AND DISCRIMINATION. THIS CULTURE HAS FATAL CONSEQUENCES AS SHOWN IN THE TRAGIC MASS SHOOTING. AT THE POLLS NIGHT CLUB IN ORLANDO FLORIDA WHICH TOOK THE LIVES OF FORTY NINE PEOPLE. AND WOUNDED FIFTY THREE OTHERS MOST OF WHOM WERE LGBT Q. LATINO INDIVIDUALS. DESPITE THE INJUSTICES AGAINST THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. THE COMMUNITY HAS OVERCOME EACH AND EVERY OBSTACLE IN STRIDE AND I OUT ARE UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT THEIR FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS. AND IDENTITY. ON THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF STONE WALL. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR SCHOOL CURRICULUM ADDED A THIRD GENDER OPTION IN OUR STATE ID'S. AND CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST LGBT Q. LEGISLATORS IN THE NATION. IN THE SPIRIT I LIKE TO MENTION THE REVOLUTIONARY WORK OF SYLVIA HE BETTER. A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD PORTER RICAN DRAG QUEEN WHO USE HER VOICE TO INFORM AND TRANSFORM. THE LGBT Q. MOVEMENT AND PUT THE VOICE OF TRANS WOMEN AND TRANS WOMAN OF COLOR. AT THE FOREFRONT IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND WHO STORY WITHIN STONE WALL IS ONLY NOW BEING TOLD BY THOSE THAT CAME AFTER HER. LIKE BAMBI SAYS HELLO FROM LOS ANGELES WHO NOW RUNS THE NATIONAL TRENDS LET THE NOT COALITION. ADDING PERSPECTIVE AN INTERSECTION NOW READY TO THE TRANS IMMIGRANT UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY WHO EVERY DAY CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR RECOGNITION AND JUSTICE THE PURSUIT. OF THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS. AND ALSO IN THAT SPIRIT AND THE SPIRIT OF THOSE TIMES A REVOLUTION OF THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES. I LIKE TO GIVE A PERSONAL SHOUT OUT OF LOVE AND APPRECIATION TO THE LGBT Q. PATRONS OF THE BLACK CAT TAVERN. IN THE SILVER LAKE NEIGHBORHOOD OF EIGHTY FIFTY ONE THE TWO YEARS PRIOR TO STONE WALL WERE HARASSED AND BEATEN BY POLICE SIMPLY FOR KISSING. DURING A NEW YEAR'S EVE CELEBRATION. IN RESPONSE THE COMMUNITY PROTEST THAT FOR THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS WERE FELT ACROSS THE NATION WHICH LED TO STONE WALL. TO HONOR THOSE BEFORE US WE THE MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY MUST FOSTER A CLIMATE OF INCLUSIVITY INTERSECTION NOW LADY. AN ADVOCATE FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY UNTIL ALL MEMBERS ARE HEARD SEEN AND CELEBRATED BECAUSE LOVE IS LOVE IS LOVE IS LOVE NO MATTER WHO OR WHERE YOU WORSHIP. AS A PROUD ALLY. KLAY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON ACR. NINETY NINE THE MYSTERY OF DOCTOR EGGMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE AS A PROUD MEMBER THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND ALSO AS A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER WHO WAS DONE. A LOT OF WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS OVER THE WORLD OVER THE WORLD OVER MY LIFE -- BUT I GUESS I JUST WANT TO ADD MY VOICE TO THE VOICES SPEAKING TODAY. THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE BASED TYPES OF CONVERSION THERAPY THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS TIME TRIED AND TRUE AND TESTED WE KNOW IT IS -- ACTUALLY IS DANGEROUS IT IS COUNTER INTUITIVE -- AND I THINK IT SPEAKS TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER ISSUES AROUND ADDICTION ISSUES AROUND HOMELESSNESS. IS YOUR OWN SELF DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIORS THAT OFTEN COME FROM A DEEP PLACE THAT LIVES INSIDE SOMEBODY WHO SAYS I'M NOT OKAY. THAT I NEED TO BE CHANGED THAT MY COMMUNITY CAN'T SEE ME AS WHO I AM FOR THE AS A AS WE HEARD FROM OTHER ARE CHAPLAIN THE ONE IN SIX TRILLION PERSON. IN THE WORLD THAT IS JUST YOU THAT IS BORN JUST TELL YOU ARE TO LOVE JUST TO YOU LOVE AND TO BE LOVED FOR WHO YOU ARE -- AND CONTINUE ON WITH THINGS LIKE CONVERSION THERAPIES TELLS ALL THE UNCLE BUDDIES OF THE WORLD THAT THEY DON'T BELONG THAT THEY ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH THAT SOMETHING IN THEM IS WRONG. AND MUST BE CHANGED WE WANT TO REBUKE THAT WITH OUR HARSHEST VOICE TO SAY THAT IS NOT THE WAY FOR ANY OF US TO LIVE OUR FULL AND TRUEST LIFE THE WAY WE LIVE OUR FULL AND TRUEST LIFE IS TO HAVE THOSE AROUND US. NOT LOOKING AT US AS THOUGH SOMETHING ABOUT US MUST BE CHANGED SO THAT WE CAN BE EQUAL BUT THAT WE STAND SIDE BY SIDE SHOULDER SUPPORTS SHOULDER AND HEART TO HEART. WITH ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT WE ARE ALL OKAY AND I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR NINETY NINE AGAIN THERE IS NO EVIDENCE BASED CONVERSION THERAPY IT IS SIMPLY A PLOY. TO PREY UPON PEOPLE'S -- MY DEEPEST FEARS AND DEEPEST INSECURITIES ABOUT THE DESIRE ONLY TO BE LOVED AND ACCEPTED I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON ACR.

AND WHAT EVER THAT PATH WHOEVER THEY ARE I DON'T WANT ANYONE. ANYONE. TELLING THEM THAT THEY ARE A DISEASE THAT NEEDS TO BE CURED THAT THEY ARE A WRONG. THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE RIGHT.

THE NUMBER IS ONLY SLIGHTLY BETTER IN SCHOOL SETTINGS API LGBT Q. STUDENTS -- RESPONDED ONLY AT THE LEVEL OF 29% WHO SAID THAT THEY COULD BE DEFINITELY WHO THEY ARE IN SCHOOLS. THIS IS A RESOLUTION THAT IS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS THE STATISTICS BY ENCOURAGING ALL OF US TO EMBRACE ACCEPTANCE AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT AND WITHOUT I HOPE THAT YOU CAN SUPPORT ACR.

AND I'VE SEEN OVER TIME THE CONFLATION OF OUR POLITICS -- AND AND RELIGION. AND I THINK UNFORTUNATELY FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE BELIEVERS. IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO SEE THIS EMERGENCE OF BETWEEN RELIGION AND POLITICS AND I THINK SOME OF US. INSTEAD OF SHOWING LOVE SHOWED HATE. AND THEN OTHER SOCIAL ILLS CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF OF CONVERSION THERAPY THIS THE MEASURE BEFORE US TODAY -- IS NOT ABOUT. RELIGION IT IS ABOUT LOVE AND IF I CAN FOR JUST A MOMENT IF I MIGHT.

BECAUSE I AM FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE YOUR WORKS ARE WONDERFUL I KNOW THAT FULL WELL. WE ARE ALL GOD'S CHILDREN. WE NEED TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER. ALSO WHEN I THINK OF THE AUTHOR FOR ALL OF HIS WORK ON THIS -- I KNOW FOR FOR YEARS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO HIM AND THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT HE JUST WANTED TO JAM THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE HE'S LISTENED. HE'S WORKED HARD HE'S BEEN UP AND DOWN -- THIS STATE. I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR HIS WORK ON THIS AND A STRONG I I URGE THIS BODY A TO VOTE YES. THERE WAS REYES WAS POWER CAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR. NINETY NINE AS THE SISTER OF AN LGBT Q. MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY WHO REMEMBERS.

TO THE COLLEAGUES FROM YOU GO VALLEY. PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE FOR THOSE WHO NOT VOTE IN SUPPORT OF IT WAS THAT SUCH THAT. MANY OF YOU SURE CONVERSATIONS PERHAPS THIS MIGHT GO TOO FAR. OR COULD WE STILL ALLOW FOR RELIGIOUS PROTECTIONS WHICH WAS CLEARLY DEFINED THE BILL BUT WAS NOT PERHAPS AS THERE V<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND&lt;/c&gt;</u> WITH RESPECT TO THE POSITIONS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAD -- BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US HERE IS THE RESULT OF A SEEMINGLY DIVERGENT VIEW POINT TO WHICH WE HAVE ACTUALLY COME TOGETHER AND STATED OUR COLLECTIVE INTEREST IN THE PUBLIC GOOD OF PROTECTING INDIVIDUALS. AGAIN TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE AM CONVERSION THERAPY AS A FRAUDULENT PRACTICE FLEW OUT OF THIS BODY. IT ALSO FLEW OFF THE SENATE FLOOR AND WAS READY FOR THE GOVERNOR SIGNATURE. BUT MANY OF YOU SAID. PLEASE WOULD YOU PAUSE BECAUSE WE JUST FEEL LIKE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY PERHAPS HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS SOME CONCERNS. SO IN FACT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID. WE PULLED THE BILL. AWAY FROM THE GOVERNOR SIGNATURE AND THAT LAW WAS NOT PUT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR. FOR HIS APPROVAL. NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MANY OF YOU BUT HOW HOW MANY LEGISLATORS.

THEN YOU SHOULD VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE THIS RESOLUTION TALKS ABOUT THE T. ESSENCE OF WHICH YOU SHARED WITH ME PERSONALLY ONE ON ONE THAT THIS IS A NON BINDING RESOLUTION BUT IN FACT YOU ALSO BELIEVE IN BASIC. LOVE IN THE PADDY AND RESPECT JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE THIS IS WHY WE CELEBRATE PRIDE. BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS GROWING UP. WE DON'T WANT THEM TO THINK. ABOUT SUICIDE. AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF SUICIDE THE PERCENTAGE OF SUICIDE AMONG LGBT YOUTH. I DO NOT WANT TO SEE A YOUNGER EVAN LOW. IN WHICH I THOUGHT ABOUT SUICIDE AND WHEN MY PARENTS MY FATHER WHO THEM THOMAS AS A DOCTOR ALSO SAID.

IT ALSO PROVIDES A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR GRANT PROGRAM FOR FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES. I WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE FOR SB. SEVENTY FIVE THANK YOU MISTER TANG MISTER OF REALTY MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB SEVENTY FIVE MEMBERS THIS BILL CONTINUES THE ASSAULT ON CHARTER SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. CURRENT STATE LAW PERMITS ANY SCHOOL A PUBLIC MAGNET SCHOOL OR A CHARTER SCHOOL TO ENFORCE ACADEMIC STANDARDS ON ADMISSIONS THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD TAKE THAT ABILITY AWAY FROM CHARTER SCHOOLS IN FACT. UNDER THIS TRAILER BILL CHARTER SCHOOLS WOULD NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO REQUEST AN ACADEMIC TRANSCRIPT OF SOMEONE WHO APPLIES TO THEIR PROGRAM. SIMILARLY UNDER CURRENT STATE LAW A PUBLIC MAGNET SCHOOL OR A CHARTER SCHOOL MAY ENFORCE ACADEMIC STANDARDS ON ITS STUDENTS. THIS WILL WOULD PROHIBIT IT JUST A CHARTER SCHOOL BERMAN FORCING THOSE STANDARDS EDISON ROLLING A STUDENT BECAUSE THEY FOUGHT FAILED TO MEET THE STANDARDS. PUBLIC MAGNET SCHOOLS ND SPECIAL SCHOOL DISTRICT PROGRAMS WOULD STILL BE ALLOWED TO DO THIS. COLLEAGUES THIS BILL WILL SERIOUSLY DEGRADE THE EDUCATIONAL DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND SERIOUSLY IMPACT THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND CAL CALIFORNIA I URGE A NO VOTE. THEY WERE SHOWING ALL THE MISS WALDRON IF YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ATTACK ON CHARTER SCHOOLS BASED ON THE FALSE PREMISE THE CHARTER SCHOOL SKIM ONLY THE BEST STUDENTS AND PUSH OUT LOW PERFORMING CHILDREN. DESPITE ALLOWING MAGNET SCHOOLS AND SPECIALIZED SCHOOL DISTRICT PROGRAMS TO SET ADMISSION STANDARDS. THIS BILL UNFAIRLY SINGLES OUT CHARTER'S BY PREVENTING THEM FROM USING THE VERY SAME PRACTICE. IF ADMISSION STANDARDS AREOKAY FOR MAGNET SCHOOLS WHY ARE WE ATTEMPTING TO TREAT CHARTERS DIFFERENTLY. THIS BILL WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEMS FACING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN ANOTHER ATTACK ON CHARTER SCHOOLS AND ITS DISTRACTION. FROM BADLY NEEDED REFORM EFFORTS THAT WILL GIVE ALL CHILDREN THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE. I ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEE RECOGNITION. IS TAKING MY CLOTHES WE WISH. WITH THAT CLARK LIBERALS. ALL MEMBERS OF THE DESIRE TO VOTE ON MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF THE ALL MEMBERS VOTE. WHO DESIRE TO VOTE [inaudible] QUIRK WELL. CLOSER ALL. TELL YOU ABOUT AYE AYES. FIFTY SEVEN KNOWS TWELVE THAT MISTER PASSES IN WITHOUT OBJECTION IMMEDIATE TRANSMITTAL. TO THE SENATE. MEMBERS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE THIS IS SB. SEVENTY EIGHT SB. SEVENTY EIGHT CORPORATE. SENATE BILL SEVENTY EIGHT BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AND ACT LIKE THE HEALTH MAKING PREPARATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATE TO THE BUDGET. MISTER KAY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS IS THE FIRST OF TWO HEALTH TRAILER BILLS -- FIRST THIS BILL FINALLY RESTORES CUTS TO THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM MADE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION -- THESE CUTS BEEN LONG OVERDUE AS SPECIFICALLY RESTORING -- CUTS REGARDING MEDI CAL BENEFITS INCLUDING. OPTICAL PODIATRY AUDIOLOGY IN SPEECH THERAPY. ADDITIONALLY WERE ALSO. DOING RESTORATION TO PUBLIC HEALTH AS PART OF CREATING NEW PREVENTION PROGRAMS FOR HIV AND STDS. AND THEN LASTLY WE ARE AUTHORIZING THE REINSTATEMENT OF THAT INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY AND PROVIDES INCREASES IN SUBSIDIES FOR HEALTH COVERAGE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THESE PENALTIES WILL GO TO ENSURE THAT MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE SUBSIDIES WILL BE PROVIDED FOR PEOPLE BETWEEN WHICH FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR'S INCOME. BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR CALIFORNIA HAS PROJECTED THAT THESE NEW SUBSIDIES WHAT IMPACT ALMOST A MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND HELP THEM GET THE HEALTH CARE ACCESS THAT THEY DESERVE. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE FOR SB. SEVENTY THINGS TING MISTER OF ROYALTY THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB. SEVENTY EIGHT THIS BILL WILL CREATE A MANDATE THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA MUST PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE AND CREATE A PENALTY FOR THOSE WHO FAIL TO ACHIEVE THAT. THAT PENALTY REVENUE WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE. IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THOSE SUBSIDIES WILL GO THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBSIDY REVENUE WILL BE SPENT. FOR PEOPLE ABOVE 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND ELIGIBILITY FOR THOSE SUBSIDIES WILL EXTEND ALL THE WAY UP LEVEL. SO TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE LEVEL RIGHT NOW IS AN INCOME OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A SINGLE PERSON. OR ALMOST A HUNDRED AND HIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A FAMILY OF THREE IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHEN IT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA THE PEOPLE PREDOMINANTLY THE PAID THE PENALTY IS. WERE YOUNG HEALTHY PEOPLE WITH AN INCOME OF EITHER BETWEEN THIRTY THOUSAND AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SO THIS TRAILER BILL IF WE PASS IT TODAY WE'LL TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM PEOPLE MAKING THIRTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND GIVE IT TO PEOPLE MAKING BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR COLLEAGUES THAT MAKES NO SENSE I REGIONAL VOTE. THANK YOU MISS ROAD ONLY SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE ITEM YES. DR AMULET HERE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. IN RESPONSE TO THE CRITIQUE FROM OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT OCCURS TODAY TO SOME PEOPLE. FOR A COUPLE WHO ARE IN THEIR EARLY SIXTIES COULD SPEND AS MUCH AS HEALTH CARE. AFTER WHAT WE SEE IN AFFORDABILITY THAT COMES IN A SUBSEQUENT TRAILER BILL SB ONE OF SIX WE WILL CAP THAT AT 18% OF INCOMES THAT CAN BE SPENT ON PREMIUMS. THAT'S STILL A LOT OF MONEY BUT IT'S MUCH LESS THAN THEY'RE CURRENTLY SPENDING NOW. TWO SEPARATE STUDIES HAVE USED DIFFERENT MICRO SIMULATION MODELS AS WELL. WHICH WOULD SHOW THAT WE COULD INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND COVERED CALIFORNIA BY UP TO A HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE. AS WE INCREASE THE PREMIUM OBSESS ASSISTANCE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING. UNTIL NOW PROVIDING AFFORDABILITY HAS HAD A STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL. SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR. NOW SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. THESE ARE TO VOTE ON MEMBERS VOTERS ARE ABOUT. ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE KIRK WELL. CLOSE YOUR ROLL TIDE ABOUT EYES.

THIS BILLS ON PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE ACTION WE HAD OF OFFERING MEDI CAL TO YOUNG PEOPLE UP TO EIGHTEEN REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS THIS WILL EXPAND.

THAT THE PER CAPITA COST TO THE STATE OF THESE NEW ENROLLEES WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN IT SPENDS CURRENTLY ON A WOMAN IN MEDI CAL THAT'S BECAUSE THESE ARE ENROLLEES THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A FEDERAL MATCH. FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE DOLLARS. I ALSO FEEL THAT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO FIX MEDI CAL FOR THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO DEPEND ON IT NOW BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY FOR IT. I GET PHONE CALLS EVERY SINGLE DAY IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE FROM CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE ALL BUT OR ILL AND ARE UNABLE TO SEE A DOCTOR. AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE SO FEW DOCTORS IN MY DISTRICT ARE ABLE TO TAKE THE LOW REIMBURSEMENTS THAT MEDI CAL PROVIDES THEM. AND THEREFORE VERY FEW OPPORTUNITIES EXIST FOR MY CONSTITUENTS TO GET ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE COLLEAGUES WE NEED TO FIX THOSE PROBLEMS FIRST AND MAKE SURE WERE FROM FILLING THE PROMISES THAT WE MADE.

MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OF AN ITEM ON THE ASSEMBLY THIRD READING FILE. THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER. THIRTY THREE AC A FOURTEEN BY MISS GONZALES. THE CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOURTEEN BY SOME REMEMBER GONZALEZ AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. MS GONZALEZ YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. AC A FOURTEEN IS SIMPLY A RESOLUTION THAT ASKS THE VOTERS WHETHER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENSURE ALL WORKERS WHO PERFORM SUPPORT SERVICES. AT THE UC ARE AFFORDED THE SAME EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. STANDARDS AS YOU SEE EMPLOYER HE'S. BEYOND PROVIDING WORLD CLASS INSTRUCTION AND RESEARCH AT ITS CAMPUSES A MEDICAL CENTERS THE YOU SEE IS THE STATE'S THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN AS AN ANCHOR IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES. IN RECENT YEARS THE UC HAS OUTSOURCED AN ESTIMATED SEVEN THOUSAND SUPPORT JOBS WHAT THE SAME TIME INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HIGHLY PAID ADMINISTRATORS TO APPROXIMATELY. EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIS RESULTED IN ANNUAL GONNA STATE STRAIGHT OF PAYROLL COST INCREASES OF APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THIS AMOUNT MATCHES WHAT YOU SEE IS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED WOULD COST OFFER OUTSOURCED WORKERS THE FULL PROTECTIONS IN EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY STANDARDS ENJOYED BY YOU SEE EMPLOYEES. ACA FOURTEEN WILL PROTECT SERVICE WORKERS THAT YOU SEE FROM POLICIES THAT PRODUCE ECONOMIC RACIAL AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION. IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS RELATED TO THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY TO HANDLE EITHER MEDICAL EMERGENCIES OR UNANTICIPATED NEEDS. ANYWHERE IN THE UC SYSTEM WE DID TAKE A MOMENT SAID INCORPORATE UC'S CURRENT POLICIES FOR THE USE OF TEMPORARY PER DIEM UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES. TO BE CLEAR NEITHER THE LEGISLATURE NOR THE GOVERNOR CAN ADDRESS A SYSTEMATIC INEQUITIES THAT OCCUR DUE TO THE YOU SEE THE TANAMI UNDER ARTICLE NINE OF THE CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER ARTICLE TO THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE LEGISLATURE THE POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY TO ALLOW VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE. I SIMPLY ASK THAT YOU ALLOW THE VOTERS TO DECIDE WHETHER LOW INCOME SERVICE WORKERS THAT YOU SEE. THOSE WHO CLEAN THE TOILETS MOWING THE LAWN SERVE OUR FOOD AND CLEAN THE BED PANS SHOULD ENJOY THE SAME STANDARDS ENJOYED BY YOU SEE EMPLOYEES DOING THE SAME EXACT WORK. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. I THINK IT IS BECAUSE OFFICER KALRA THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER IS CHAIR OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE ARISE THE PROPERTIES WERE CO AUTHOR IS A FOURTEEN AUTHORED. BY OUR COLLEAGUE OF SAN DIEGO -- AS SHE STATED AC FOURTEEN WILL DIRECTLY ASK OUR VOTERS WITH THE WE SHOULD PROTECT THE LOWEST WAGE WORKERS AT THE UC. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE UC SYSTEM HAS TURNED UNFETTERED OUTSOURCING OF LOW WAGE WORK WITH PROMISES OF COST CONTAINMENT AND PROCUREMENT BENEFITS. HOWEVER. WHEN THE STATE AUDITOR REVIEWED TEN OF THESE CONTRACTS THEY TELL OF THE UC LACKED ADEQUATE DOCUMENTATION TO SUBSTANTIATE? NINE OF THE TEN BENEFITS REVIEWED AND THE LOW WAGE OUTSOURCED WORKERS AT THE UC IRVINE EARLY THREE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY SIX CENTS LOWER AN HOURLY WAGES ON AVERAGE. THAN UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES DOING SIMILAR WORK. ONLY THE VOTERS CAN CORRECT THESE INEQUITIES AN ACA FOURTEEN EMPOWERS VOTERS WITH THE NECESSARY CHANGES IN THE UC SYSTEM THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I BO. THERE WAS KALRA MISTER MCCARTY. YES THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT. THREE YEARS AGO THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A BILL AB EIGHT FOUR EIGHT WHICH I AUTHORED. TO CRACK DOWN ON THIS YOU SEE OUTSOURCING HOWEVER BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CAN DO THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY -- THE PRACTICE HAS CONTINUED SO THIS ESSENTIALLY PROVIDES US AN OPPORTUNITY FOLLOW UP ON THAT GO TO THE VOTERS AND MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING OUR BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK. A FEW YEARS AGO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SPENT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS DEL SOURCE IT WORKERS. AND THEIR EXISTING WORKERS WERE FORCED TO TRAIN THOSE PEOPLE WHO WOULD TAKE THEIR JOBS. AND IT WAS FOUND OUT THAT THE CONTRACT COST TAXPAYERS MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. HURT EMPLOYMENT GOT RID OF MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AND COST TAXPAYERS THIS IS A MEASURE WHICH TIME IS DO. MORE POORLY GHOST ELECTORATE ASK THEM TO WEIGH IN AS WELL THANK YOU. THEY WERE ESCORTED MISTER JONES SAWYER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACA FOURTEEN BY OUR ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO -- AS SOMEONE WHO'S DONE. PROBABLY SEVERAL HUNDRED CONTRACTS THE PUBLIC SECTOR I KNOW FIRST HAND WHAT IT'S LIKE. FOR A LOW BALLED BITTER TO COME IN. PROMISE THE WORLD TO A GOVERNMENT ENTITY. AND THEN IN THE END WE SPEND MORE WITH A WORD THAT WOULD JUST TWO WORDS CALL CHANGE ORDERS WE DON'T ALWAYS DO THE BEST AT CONTRACTING. I DON'T ALWAYS DO THE BEST A DOING THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. WHAT HAPPENS IS AFTER THE CONTRACT GOES OVER AND OVER YOU DO A CHANGE ORDER? THAT CHANGE ORDER INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF THE ORIGINAL -- BID AND BEFORE LONG YOUR PLANE TWICE AS MUCH SOMETIMES THREE TIMES MORE. THEN THE PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEE. AND MOST IMPORTANT YOU GET LESS WORK THAN YOU DID BEFORE. PUBLIC EMPLOYEES BY RULE ALMOST ALWAYS NOT ONLY HAVE PRIDE IN WHAT THEY DO THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY DO THE BEST JOB THAT MONEY CAN BUY. YOU WANT SOMEONE THAT THEY HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN DOING THE WORK ESPECIALLY TO UC'S. UC'S AS WE ALL KNOW. AS WE ALL KNOW HAVE NOT BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE WITH THIS LEGISLATURE THIS BILL. HELPS PROTECT NOT ONLY THE TAXPAYERS. BUT IT ALSO GIVES BODY THE FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT MONIES ARE SPENT APPROPRIATELY. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO SAID. THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE TWELVE YEAR TERMS. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR OFFICE EVERY TWO YEARS. THEY'RE IN FOR TWELVE YEARS AND TO GET ANOTHER TWELVE YEARS IN PART ALMOST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY. WHICH MEANS THEY IGNORE US MOST OF THE TIME THIS BILL ACTUALLY HAS A LOOK AT HOW THEY SPEND TAXPAYERS MONEY AND ACTUALLY HAS SOME INPUT. SOME INPUT INTO IT ONE DAY I WOULD LOVE TO RUN A BILL. TO SHORTEN THOSE TERMS OR TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE MORE. CONSTITUTIONALLY AVAILABLE NOT ONLY TO THE PUBLIC. BUT TO THIS BODY. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] DOCTOR QUIRK. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I WORKED FOR YOU SEE FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS. THAT'S THE TIME I SPENT AT LARGE SLAB WHERE YOU SEE WAS THE OUR CONTRACTOR TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND RAN LAWRENCE LAP. IN MY FIRST FIFTEEN YEARS EVERYBODY ON CAMPUS ONCE IN A PLOY E.. UNLESS YOU'RE COMING IN AND SELECT TRICIA AND OR SOMETHING TO DO A JOB THAT TOOK A DAY OR TWO THEN. ALONG AROUND NINETY IN THE EARLY NINETIES. ARE THEY MADE THE CAFETERIA WORKERS [inaudible] CONTRACT WORKERS. SO PEOPLE WHO WERE GETTING A PENSION. PEOPLE WHO WERE GETTING A DECENT WAGE NOW WORK FOR CONTRACTORS. WHEN THE CONTRACTOR CAME IN MAYBE THEY TO HIRE THEM MAYBE THEY WON'T? AND THEN IN ANOTHER FIVE YEARS ANOTHER CONTRACTOR WHO MIGHT HIRE YOU MIGHT NOT. BUT NO JOB SECURITY [inaudible] NO PENSION. WHAT WAS UC DOING? WE HEARD YOU SHE SAY. AT OUR HEARING AND APPROPRIATIONS -- WE JUST DO THIS BECAUSE IT'S NECESSARY. THAT'S NOT TRUE THEY'RE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CUT COSTS AND THEY WANT TO CUT COSTS. BY GIVING WORKERS LESS SECURITY. LAST PENSIONS. BASICALLY ABUSING THE SYSTEM. IF A PERSON CAN DO THE JOB AND DOES THE JOB YEAR AFTER YEAR THEY OUGHT TO BE AN EMPLOYEE WE OUGHT NOT TO ALLOW YOU SEE. YOUR VIEWS ITS WORKERS THANK YOU. I GET A COURT MISTER MEDINA KERRIGAN S. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AYE RISES AS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AND IS A PROUD GRADUATE OF UC RIVERSIDE. IN SUPPORT OF A CA. FOURTEEN DURING MY TIME AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. AND THE HORRIBLE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I'VE FOUGHT THEN. AGAINST OUTSOURCING WHETHER IT WAS LIBRARIANS. OR BUS DRIVERS OR MAINTENANCE WORKERS. BECAUSE I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES THAT PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WHO ARE EMPLOYED WHETHER IT BE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE THE SAME WHEN I WAS A TRUSTEE. AT RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND THE EFFORT WAS MADE TO TRY TO PRIVATIZE THE BOOKSTORE. AND OF TAKE OFF THE WORKERS IN THAT IN THE BOOKSTORE AND MAKE THEM -- NON PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. THAT EMPLOYEES SHOW THAT THEY DO A BETTER JOB WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO WORK FOR THE INSTITUTION WHICH THEY TAKE PRIDE IN. AND AS I'VE FOUGHT AGAINST CUTTING LIBRARIANS AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER BECAUSE OF BUDGET -- RESTRICTIONS ARE TRYING TO CUT BUDGET. I KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT. THAT LOOKING AT THE LOWEST PAID WORKERS IS NOT THE PLACE TO CUT MANY I AM A PROUD SUPPORTER. OF UC EVERY YEAR I FIGHT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INCREASE OUR FUNDING OF UC BUT I AM VERY HAPPY AND PROUD TO SUPPORT ACA FOURTEEN IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THANKYOU MISTER MEDINA MISTER MURATSUCHI YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HI. WILL VOTE FOR THIS A CA. BUT I WANT TO RAISE. SOME CONCERNS THAT I THINK WE SHOULD ALL KEEP IN MIND. YOU KNOW I'M VOTING FOR THIS BECAUSE I SUPPORT WORKERS. ESPECIALLY MAKING SURE THAT ARE -- WORKERS ON THE LOW END OF THE PAY SCALE OR NOT HAVING THEIR JOBS CONTRACTED OUT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT A FORGET A FEEL GOD IN SUPPORTING OUR WORKERS. THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT. YOU KNOW THIS YEAR. AS A MEMBER OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IN EDUCATION FUNDING I SUPPORTED THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S REQUEST FOR NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FUNDING. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. ACCORDING TO THE FLOOR ANNOUNCES. THIS MEASURE IF PASSED BY THE VOTERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MAY RESULT IN ONGOING GENERAL FUND COST PRESSURES. POSSIBLY IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO AGAIN. YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IS. ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT WE HAVE GOING FOR US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS THE BEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IF NOT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. AND I'M GONNA CONTINUE THE CHAMPION THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT THE WORKERS LET'S SUPPORT THE WORKERS BY INCREASING FUNDING. TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE BEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. MR BELOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER ON A MEMBERS -- LIKE OUR FRIEND FROM THE SOUTH BAY OF LOS ANGELES I RISE AND CAUTIOUS SUPPORT. OF FLOOD OF THIS A CA. I I DO BELIEVE THAT CONTRACTING OUT. I AND ITS IMPACT ON WAGES AND BENEFITS AS A REAL ISSUE FOR WORKERS AND I COMMEND THE MEMBER FROM -- SAN DIEGO FOR WORKING SO HARD ON ON THIS ISSUE. BUT I I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS -- WE JUST HEARD THE ESTIMATE OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- THAT THIS COULD COST THE UC ACTUALLY HAS THAT NUMBER UP AROUND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO MILLION WHAT EVER THE COST MAY BE WE HAVE. TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER THAT COST. PARTICULARLY AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE ADDED AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET WITH AN EMPHASIS ON INCREASING ENROLLMENT WELL THIS IS A REAL ISSUE. TOO AND I TAKE THE POINT THAT. AS A MATTER OF FLYING MALADY THIS CAN ONLY BE CHANGED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BUT THAT'S NOT EXACTLY THE CASE WE CAN ALSO CHANGE THIS BY USING THE POWER OF THE PURSE THAT WE HAVE. JUST AS WE HAVE WITH UNIVERSITY AND ROLL MEANT -- WE'VE CHANGED THE DYNAMIC ON THAT AND WE COULD WORK HARDER TO CHANGE THE DYNAMIC THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE BUDGET PROCESS WHICH I THINK IS FAVORABLE MORE FAVORABLE TO DOING SOMETHING THAT IS RIGID AND INFLEXIBLE ONCE IT IS PUT INTO CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. WE KNOW HOW BALLOT MEASURES ARE. WE WE WITH OUR OWN LEGISLATION FREQUENTLY COME BACK TO CLEAN UP THAT LEGISLATION BECAUSE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. I'M I'M VOTING FOR THIS TODAY I AM HOPING THAT COOLER HEADS WILL PREVAIL AND THAT THERE CAN BE A NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION TO THIS SO THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE CALM. A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT -- BUT FOR TODAY I'M AN AYE VOTE. THING WAS BLOW SENIOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ACA. MS GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE. I WANT TO REMIND THIS BODY OF A FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL -- THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL MA'AM IT'S GOING TO BE PUT TO VOTERS IF WE PASS IT THROUGH FOR THE VOTERS TO DECIDE. AND FOR THE VOTERS I THINK TO HAVE AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW MUCH WE'RE INVESTING OR NOT INVESTING IN YOU SEE I THINK THAT'S A GOOD DISCUSSION TO HAVE. IN A GOOD US. QUESTION TO PUT TO OUR VOTERS. ALSO RIO ONE REMIND FOLKS THAT THIS BILL THIS IS BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD AS A BILL -- I THINK AYE JOCKEYED IT FOR THREE THREE TIMES ON THIS FLOOR. GOT TO THE GOVERNOR AND YOU SEE INSISTS THAT WE CAN'T IN FACT MAKE THEM DO THIS. THEY'RE INDEPENDENT. THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT. AND I KNOW THOSE OF YOU OF WORK THROUGH BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS WITH YOU SEE OF HER THAT AS WELL. SO WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO TELL US THAT THEY CANNOT. BE FORCED TO PROTECT THEIR LOWEST WAGE WORKERS THEY CONTINUE TO PAY THEIR HIGHEST WAGE WORKERS MORE. ADMINISTRATORS. I DON'T LIKE HAVING TO DO A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR SOMETHING THAT SEEMS SO OBVIOUS. WE SHOULD JUST BE. FIGURING OUT TOGETHER. HOW TO PAY FOR THESE -- WORKERS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THE POSITION WE'RE IN AND CONTINUE TO BE AN BECAUSE THE WAY THE CONSTITUTION IS WRITTEN. SO IF YOU SEE TRULY IS A THOMAS I KNOW THE CONSTITUTION IS THERE TO PROTECT. THOSE WHO ARE THE LEAST AMONG US. SO PERHAPS IT IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE. TO GIVE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS TO THE LEAST. PAID WORKERS THE WORKERS WHO DO THE REAL WORK ON UC CAMPUS WHO WILL NEVER HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING POWER. IN THIS BUILDING OR IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH YOU SEE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK TODAY. THAT WE PASS THIS FORD. THAT WE DO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ARE YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE REAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW MUCH THAT IS. BUT WE LET THE VOTERS DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE NOT THEY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO PROTECT UC WORKERS. UP AND DOWN THE SPECTRUM INCLUDING THOSE WERE PAID THE LEAST. AND THOSE ARE CONTRACTED OUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU MRS OLSEN WITH THAT LOCAL OF THE ROLE. DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBER SERVICE ARE TO VOTE.
