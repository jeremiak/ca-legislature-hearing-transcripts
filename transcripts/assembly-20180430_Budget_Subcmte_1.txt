I'D LIKE TO ASK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF POSSIBLE TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE STAFF TO. COME UP WITH SOME METRICS THAT WE CAN FOLLOW TO ENSURE THAT THE PROPOSAL HAS OUTCOMES THAT WE. CAN SEE WHERE THE STATE INVESTMENT IS BEING SPENT AND. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN WOULD YOU YEAH NOW ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONSIDERATION AND AND THAT IS THE GOAL OF TAP CARE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE. WE CAN PROVIDE SERVICES BUT THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE. THE MONEY THAT WE'RE INVESTING OUR HOPEFULLY BE INVESTING IN THEIR SERVICES AS IS ACCOUNTED FOR AND. HOPEFULLY GIVE. UP REALLY POSITIVE OUTCOME WITH THE MONEY THAT WE'RE INVESTING SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CONSIDERATION THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER THANK YOU THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE. I'M HERE UP ON ISSUE TOO ON BEHALF OF. TEN OTHER ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES MYSELF BUT I ON A BIPARTISAN REQUEST. I'M. THE DATA ALL SANTA LETTER ACROSS THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET ALLOCATE THREE MILLION DOLLARS CONTRACT. BUT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES TO INCORPORATE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ARE ACCESS TO. AND THE NEED FOR LONG TERM CARE SUPPORT SERVICES IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY. IN THE TWENTIETH NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR SURVEY CYCLES. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS CLOSED EIGHT MILLION PERSONS WERE EITHER SENIORS AGE SIXTY FIVE AND OVER. OR PERSONS UNDER AGE SIXTY FIVE WHO HAVE DISABILITIES THIS POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE NEXT DECADE PRIMARILY TO THE AGING OF THE POPULATION BUT ALSO DUE TO THE GROWING NUMBER OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. INCLUDING THOSE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. DESPITE THIS UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH THE NEEDS FOR LTE SS. CALIFORNIA IS NOT COLLECTED DATA NEEDS TO ACCURATELY TRACK AND PLAN FOR THESE NEEDS. FOR NATIONAL SURVEYS COLLECTED ON THE PREVALENCE OF DISABILITIES AND COGNITIVE AND FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENTS THAT ARE NOT PROVIDE STATE AND COUNTY LEVEL ESTIMATES OF THE POPULATION THAT NEEDS AND USES LTFS. IN CALIFORNIA. NORRIS SAYS THE NEED THROUGHOUT YES HAS BY INCOME LEVEL AGE TYPE OF DISABILITY GEOGRAPHIC REGION OR RACIAL OR ETHNIC GROUP. A MODEST INVESTMENT DEVELOPING BETTER AND MORE ACCURATE STATE AND COUNTY LEVEL DATA ONE ABLE THE STATE TO ENGAGE IN BETTER PLANNING FOR THE L. TSS NEEDS OF ITS GROWING POPULATION OF SENIORS. AND PERSONS OF A DISABILITIES. THE STATE WILL NOT ONLY BE BENEFICIAL TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO REQUIRE LTSA US IN THE FUTURE. BALL PROVIDE ABOUT THE DATA FROM RESEARCHER BUDGET ANALYST AND PUBLIC POLICY ADVOCATES TO ASSIST US AS WE LOOK DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE FUNDING MECHANISMS TO DEAL WITH THIS LOOMING PROBLEM. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOCTOR KEPT. I'M STEVE QUE FROM. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO PROFESSOR AT THE INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH AND AGEING. PLACEMENT IS MICHAEL AND WORKING. AND. LONG TERM CARE WE CALL IT LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IS NOT JUST NURSING HOMES NOT JUST INSTITUTIONAL CARE MOSTLY IT'S PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THEIR HOMES IN THE COMMUNITIES. AND THEY GET HELP FROM PEOPLE MOSTLY IT'S NOT PEOPLE WHO GET HELP FROM PUBLIC PROGRAMS LIKE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES IT'S PEOPLE WHO GET ON HELP FROM FAMILY MEMBERS. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE GET A MIX OF BOTH. IT'S NOT JUST ELDERLY PEOPLE IT'S NON ELDERLY PEOPLE HAVE DISABILITIES ON AND THE GOAL IS THE GOAL OF MUCH OF IT IS REALLY TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES IT WHICH IS WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS HOME THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES. AND AVOID INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND IT SAVES MONEY TO. ARE AND THAT WHAT ELSE YES S. DOES IS IT HELPS PEOPLE MAINTAIN THEIR HEALTH THEIR ABILITY TO FUNCTION THEIR INDEPENDENCE TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. OTHER SELF DETERMINATION AND THEIR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IS ACTIVE MEMBERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND AVOID THE ISOLATION THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY SENIORS. ARE OFTEN HAVE. SO AS WE JUST HEARD THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IN CALIFORNIA I CAN TELL YOU THAT ROUGHLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA NEEDLE TEST'S* RIGHT NOW. ON BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU PRECISELY BECAUSE NEITHER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR THE STATE DOES DATA COLLECTION WHICH WE ACTUALLY ACCURATELY MEASURE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO NEED. OUR EL TSS. AND THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF WE DON'T NEED NO ABOUT THOSE POPULATIONS ONE OF WHICH IS TO THEY HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO CAN HELP THEM. RIGHT SO IT ARE YOU KNOW OR ARE THEY SAY LIVING ALONE WITHOUT FAMILY NEARBY AND THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO ENTER A PUBLIC PROGRAM MUCH MORE LIKELY TO APPLY FOR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND IF THEY QUALIFY GET ON. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR INCOME IS SO WE DON'T KNOW WELL ARE THEY LIKELY TO QUALIFY DO THEY NEED TO SPEND DOWN CAN. AND ONE MAJOR VERY MAJOR THING IS WE DON'T KNOWIN GENERAL. WHETHER PEOPLE'S LTFS NEEDS ARE BEING MET OR NOT. SO IN AMONG PEOPLE NOT IN PUBLIC PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY KNOW NOTHING WE DON'T KNOW. WHAT PERCENTAGE THOSE PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE MET VERSES UNMET IN PUBLIC PROGRAMS WE'VE JUST DONE A STUDY? OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DUELS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICARE AL AND MEDICARE AND EVEN AMONG THESE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS MOST OF WHOM ARE GETTING I JUST ASK IF THEY NEED IT. FORTY TWO PERCENT SAID THEY DID NOT GET ALL THE HELP THEY NEEDED WITH THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES. FORTY TWO PERCENT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN MAJOR PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY DON'T GET ALL THE HELP THEY NEED FOR EXAMPLE. THEY TAKE THE WRONG MEDICATIONS ARE DON'T TAKE THEIR MEDICATION. THEY HAVE TOSTAY IN BED OR AT HOME BECAUSE NOBODY IS THERE TO HELP THEM GET OUT AND PARTICIPATE IN SOMETHING. THEY DON'T GET TO THE TOILET ON TIME THEY END UP ON IN CLOTHES THAT ARE SOIL THEY DON'T EAT THE FOOD THEY NEED AND IT HAPPENS A LOT. SO. THE OTHER MAIN THING THAT WE DON'T KNOW IS Y. PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BARRIERS ARE AND IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BARRIERS ARE WE CAN'T SOLVE IT SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS FOR EXAMPLE. ONE OF THESUPPORTS THAT FAMILY CAREGIVERS NEED SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP DOING WHAT THEY DO AND DO IT BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY. WE DON'T KNOW THAT WE DON'T KNOW EITHER ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS IS THERE SOMETHING WE COULD DO A PROGRAM WE COULD IMPLEMENT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING OTHER THAN AYE CHESS AT SO THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED. A LITTLE BIT TO HELP PEOPLE WHO NEED SUPPORT WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT AT NOT SOME HUGE AMOUNT OF OF COST. WE DON'T IF THERE'S SOME PRIVATE SOLUTION LIKE MAKING LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE AXES SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT. AND COULD AFFORD AND I'VE MET ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS IS WE DON'T KNOW OUR THEIR SOLUTIONS LIKE TECHNOLOGY. ARM HOME MODIFICATIONS OTHER INNOVATIONS THAT COULD REALLY HELP PEOPLE AND DECREASE THE BURDEN OF CARE GIVING AND OF ONE OF THE STATE TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE SERVICES. SO WE JUST OR ASKING FOR OUR A SUPPLEMENT TO ADD QUESTIONS ABOUT. BELT YES ASKED TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY WHICH IS A VERY ROBUST WELL RESPECTED EXISTING SURVEY IN CALIFORNIA. ARM OF THE OF THE OVERALL POPULATION WHICH PROVIDES COUNTY LEVEL ESTIMATES VERY WELL AND IT ALREADY IS VERY WELL SET UP TO JUST ADD A FEW QUESTIONS AND THEN. ON THE PEOPLE YOU SEE EL DE LA WILL GO AND DEVELOP. A QUESTIONNAIRE WITH THE HELP OF AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND THEN FEEL THE QUESTIONNAIRE FOLLOWING UP THOSE PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFIED IN THE MAIN SURVEY AS HAVING LTFS NEEDS PLUS THEY'LL BE SOME ADDITIONAL. DETAILED INTERVIEWS DETAILED PERSONAL INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF LTO SAYS NEEDS TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THEIR INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS. BOB. I WOULD SAY THIS IS MONEY WELL SPENT BECAUSE WE REALLY KNOW SO LITTLE AND THE NEED IS URGENT RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE BABY BOOMERS LIKE ME ARE AGING INTO NEEDING MORE AT INTO HAVING MORE AND MORE LIKELIHOOD OF NEEDING AL TSS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AND IF CALIFORNIA'S AND START TO PLAN FOR THIS NOW. THE BUDGET WE BROKE AND I MEAN AT SOME POINT WILL BE SO MANY PEOPLE APPLYING FOR I JUST AS WE WANT NOT A. WE NEED AN ALTERNATIVE. THANK YOU SIR. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TO. HELLO I FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU AYE JESSICA LEHMAN WAS TERENCE'S CHO SENIOR DISABILITY ACTION IN HAND AND HAND.

THE BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY. WOULD MANDATE THAT MEDI CAL PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORS. WHEN MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT OF DIABETES. THE PROPOSAL. MAY LOOK FAMILIAR AS IT IS IDENTICAL TO A BILL I CARRIED LAST YEAR A. B. FOR FORTY SEVEN. WHICH WOULD HAVE SOUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH THE EXACT SAME. THE BILL RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BY PORTERS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN BOTH HOUSES THE LEGISLATURE. BUT WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE G. H. C. S. ALREADY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO COVER CGM. AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. SINCE THAT TIME DEPARTMENTS CONTINUOUS CERTAIN THAT THEY ARE CRAFTING GUIDELINES TO MAKE SEE GEMS AVAILABLE FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS THAT NEED THEM. WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING THAT SHE JAMS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS THAT NEED THEM. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. DEPARTMENT MAINTAINS THAT THIS CHANGE WILL GIVE MEDICARE PATIENTS ACCESS TO SEE GM WITHOUT THE NEED TO MAKE CGM A COVERED BENEFIT. AGAIN WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE. WHY WON'T DHS MAKERS SEE GEMMA COVERED BENEFIT IF THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE TO ALL? OF THOSE THAT NEED. THE REALITY IS. THE PROBLEM IS MADE IT AS HARD AS POSSIBLE TO THE MEDI CAL PATIENTS TO ACCESS HE JAMS SO THAT THEY CAN SAY ALL THE RIGHT THINGS WHILE CREATING A DE FACTO BAN ON COVERAGE. DEPARTMENT SO COMMITTED TO THIS STRATEGY MACHINE CHAIR THAT. LAST YEAR AT THE VERY SAME TIME THAT I WAS RUNNING MY BILL THEY UNILATERALLY OVERRULED AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WHO REJECTED THEIR INITIAL DECISION TO DIE COVERAGE FOR A PATIENT. SO PATIENTS ARE COVERAGE A DOCTOR AGREED. DENIED COVERAGE APPEALED THAT DECISION TO AN LJ IN LJ AGREED WITH THE PATIENT AND THE DEPARTMENT CAME AND USE THE UNILATERAL AUTHORITY TO REVERSE THAT DECISION. MEMBERS TWO POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE DIABETES AND HALF OF THIS POPULATION IS ON MEDICARE. THE RATE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS WITH DIABETES IS DOUBLE THAT OF THOSE WITH EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE. EVERY COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLAN IN CALIFORNIA COVERS CGM FOR THE TREATMENT MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES. CG ENDS ARE ALSO COVERED BY MEDICARE. COVERED CALIFORNIA. THE MEDICAID PROGRAMS OF MORE THAN THIRTY OTHER STATES NINETY PERCENT OF MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN SERVICES PROGRAM. MEDICAL STANDS ALONE DENYING CGM ACCESS TO THEIR PATIENTS. CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MYERS ARE CLINICALLY PROVEN TO BE THE BEST TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL TO MENTION TREAT DIABETES. THEY ARE THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR EVERY OTHER PATIENT POPULATION CALIFORNIA EXCEPT THOSE ON MEDICARE. WHO IN MANY INSTANCES OF THE MOST IN NEED OF THIS CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY? COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS ARE NOT REQUIRED BY LAW TO COVER THESE DEVICES AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THEY CERTAINLY ARE NOT COVERING THEM OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR HEARTS. THEY'RE COVERING CGM BECAUSE THAT RESULTS IN BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THE PATIENT POPULATIONS REDUCES COMPLICATIONS RESULTING IN HOSPITALIZATION AND ULTIMATELY SAVES THE PLANTS MONEY. CALIFORNIA COULD BENEFIT FROM THE SAME COST SAVING SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE COST OF HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH DIABETES IS BORNE BY THE TAXPAYER. SO EVEN A MODEST REDUCTION IN HOSPITALIZATIONS WOULD SEE THE STATE COME OUT AHEAD FINANCIALLY CERTAINLY PAY FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. I ASK BEFORE YOU TODAY. DEPARTMENTS MAKE CLEAR THEIR INTENT INTENTION TO CONTINUE DRAG THEIR FEET ON ADOPTING COVERAGE CRITERIA. IT'S TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP IN AS WE ATTEMPTED TO DO LAST YEAR TO FINALLY BRING AN END TO THIS DISCRIMINATORY POLICY. THIS PROPOSAL SUPPORTED BY THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS AMONGST OTHERS. I HOPE YOU'LL SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL TODAY WHEN IT COMES. BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR ABOUT AND WITH ME TODAY WE HAVE SEVERAL OTHER FOLKS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT BEGIN. DOCTOR LEVINE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOCTOR MATTHEW LEVINE AND I THINK A PRACTICING ENDOCRINOLOGIST FOR THE PAST THIRTEEN YEARS. CURRENTLY WORKING AT SCRIPPS CLINIC IN SAN DIEGO. I'M ALSO THE VICE PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT ELECT FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGIST. I'M THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A COALITION OF PHYSICIANS. DIABETES NURSE EDUCATORS PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS AND WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE TO PASS OUR PROPOSAL TO MAKE CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CGM. A COVERED BENEFIT FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. THE EPIDEMIC THAT IS DIABETES IS GROWING AND ITS IMPACT ON MEDI CAL COSTS IS ENORMOUS. ACCORDING TO A DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORT MEDI CAL SPENDING ON ADULTS TREATED FOR DIABETES TOTALED MORE THAN THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS ROUGHLY FOURTEEN PERCENT OF TOTAL SPENDING ON NON DUAL ELIGIBLES. THE MOST COSTLY FIVE PERCENT OF THE DIABETIC POPULATION GENERATES ROUGHLY THIRTY SIX PERCENT OF DIABETES SPENDING AT AN AVERAGE COST OF TWELVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE DOLLARS PER MEMBER PER MONTH. APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHICH IS AROUND ONE AND SEVEN ADULTS HAVE DIABETES AND AMONG U. S. STATES CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE OF DIABETES CASES ANNUALLY. DIABETES IS THE SEVENTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THIS STATE AND IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ADULT BLINDNESS KIDNEY FAILURE AND AMPUTATION OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. ONE OF THE FACETS OF DIABETES CARE IS MANAGEMENT OF HYPOGLYCEMIA OR LOW BLOOD SUGAR WHICH CAN BE A SIDE EFFECT OF CRITICAL LIFESAVING TREATMENTS. TWENTY SIXTEEN DATA FROM THE JOURNAL DIABETES MEDICINE SHOWS THAT TWENTY NINE PERCENT UPS OF YOUR LOW'S RESULT AND AMBULANCE AND EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES FURTHER DRIVING UP THE HEALTHCARE COSTS. CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORS FUNCTION BY CONTINUOUSLY MONITORING TISSUE FLUID GLUCOSE LEVELS A SURROGATE MARKER FOR BLOOD SUGARS AND USE ALARMS AND ALERTS TO INFORM PATIENTS WHEN BLOOD SUGAR IS EITHER EXCEEDING OR FALLING BELOW SAFE LEVELS. NUMEROUS ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE ENDOCRINE SOCIETY AGREE THAT EXPANDING COVERAGE FOR CGM CAN LEAD TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR PAPAL TRIP TO MEET PEOPLE WITH DIABETES OR DEEMED CANDIDATES FOR THIS BY THEIR TREATING PHYSICIAN. ANOTHER STUDY PUBLISHED JUST THIS MONTH IN DIABETES CARE DEMONSTRATES THAT CGM IS COST EFFECTIVE IN TYPE ONE DIABETES PATIENTS RESULTING IN IMPROVED BLOOD GLUCOSE CONTROL AND LESS HYPOGLYCEMIA. AS AN ANECDOTE I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY MENTION JOHN A PATIENT OF MINE WITH DIABETES JOHN UNFORTUNATELY SUFFERED FROM A TIME FROM DEBILITATING SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA SUBSEQUENT TO IS NEEDED INSULIN TREATMENTS. HE REQUIRED FREQUENT PARAMEDIC ASSISTANCE AND EMERGENCY ROOM CARE HIS LIFE AND WORK WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED HOWEVER. HE NOW HAS THE ABILITY THROUGH THE USE OF CG AND A BETTER RECOGNIZE IMPENDING LOW OR HIGH BLOOD SUGARS AND TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION SHOULD BE NEEDED HE HAS NOT REQUIRED AMBULANCE NOR EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES IN OVER ONE YEAR. AND IS UNDER MUCH BETTER CONTROL OVER ALL. IN CONCLUSION PUBLIC PAYER SUCH AS MEDICARE AND EVERY MAJOR COMMERCIAL PLANNING CALIFORNIA EXCEPT FOR MEDI CAL CURRENTLY COVER CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THEIR VALUE IN IMPROVING OUTCOMES. PLEASE PASS THIS IMPORTANT BUDGET PROPOSAL WHICH CAN HELP SAVE LIVES AND SAVE STATE SPENDING IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DOCTOR. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TRAINING A SELECT SEARCH TOOL CARS AT LEAST SACRAMENTO COUNTY TEAM USA TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I'M HERE TODAY TO TO APPROVE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE CGM A COVERED BENEFIT MEDI CAL BUT MAKING CGM AND MEDI CAL COVER BENEFIT. KIDS LIKE LARA CCS PROGRAM ON NOW WILL KNOW THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEIR CGM AS THEY MOVE INTO ADULT MEDI CAL. I'M A FORMER CALIFORNIA FOSTER CHILD WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES A WAS DIAGNOSED EIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT THIS AUTOIMMUNE INCURABLE DISEASE. DESPITE HAVING TEA TYPES OF INSULIN TESTING UPWARDS TO TWELVE TIMES A DAY AND MARK TO INJECTIONS. SHORTLY AFTER I WAS DIAGNOSED I SHOULD MOVE FOR MY BIOLOGICAL PARENTS LIKELY ONE FOSTER PARENT WAS A TYPE ONE DIABETIC AS WELL SO MADE THE TRANSITION A LITTLE EASIER. ABILITY TO FOSTER HOMES BEFORE WAS PLACED WITHIN ADOPTED BY MY DAD'S. TOGETHER WE DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO GET AN INSULIN PUMP THE PUMP ALLOWED ME TO CUSTOMIZE MY BASAL RATE AND FREEDOM FROM MANY OBJECTIONS. BUT I STILL HAD CHALLENGES WITH LOW AND HIGH BLOOD SUGARS. MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED A CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TO HELP ME KEEP MY BLOOD SUGARS AND WITHIN THE SAFE RANGE. IT HAS BEEN AMAZING. MY PARENTS ABLE TO MONITOR MY BLOOD GLUCOSE FROM A DISTANCE LIKE FROM WORK EVER RECEIVE UPDATES EVERY FEW MINUTES. HAVING BE DEXCOM HAS ALLOWED ME TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN PATENTS BEER CHAMPION HORSE RIDER OWNER AND BREEDER OF MY OWN NIGERIAN DWARF GOATS HEARD. FORMER MENTOR TO FOSTER YOUTH THE CLASH TO AN AFFRONT TO YOU THE QUESTION OF THE SORORITY ANYBODY SIMPLE THINGS LIKE OVER TO FRIENDS HOUSES AND HAVE SLEEPOVERS WITHOUT ANY WORRY. BUY DEXCOM HAS ALARMS THAT ENABLE ME AND OTHERS TO IT TO SEE QUICKLY TO PROVIDE LOW AND HIGH BLOOD SUGARS. THESE ALARMS ALERT MY PARENTS BECAUSE HONESTLY SOMETIMES I BECOME DEAF TO IT. I'M ABLE TO GET REPORTS ACCURATELY ADJUST MY BASE RATES NOT ABLE TO TEST LESS OFTEN. THOUGH I AM VERY BUSY NOW MY LONG TERM GOAL IS TO ATTEND UC DAVIS LIKE MY DAD EXPERT. WE COME A LARGE ANIMAL VETERINARIAN. I ALSO JIM ADJOINING THEIR HUNTER JUMPER QUESTIONING TEAM. IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS THAT I ASK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TO APPROVE LANGUAGE SO THAT I AND OTHERS. COVER BY CCS WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE OUR DREAMS WITHOUT INTERRUPTION THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOUR CONSIDERATION AND ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY STORY. THANK YOU AS WELL FOR YOUR POISON ADVOCACY. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT AS OUR LEGAL AID ADVOCATES HAVE REPORTED CLIENTS DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING THIS DESPITE BEING MEDICALLY NECESSARY. THANK YOU.

SIR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ALL OF IRAQ RIGHT CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. YOU SIR. HELLO MY NAME IS WENDY CHAD I OF A NINETEEN YEAR OLD TWO ND DAUGHTER. UNDERSTANDING FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHAT A DIFFERENCE CONTINUOUS MONITORS CAN BE AND WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HELP PROTECT GLUCOSE TRENDS GIVE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES AND BETTER OVERALL. CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND ADULTS LIVING WITH T. ONE D.. POINTS THIS OUT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR ME TODAY CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORS ALSO ALLOW US AS PARENTS TO LIVE IN LESS FEAR AND BE MORE PRODUCTIVE IN OUR LIVES SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. WE CAN. THOMAS ERIC'S IN SUPPORT OF MY DAUGHTER ANOTHER CC ESSE. PARTICIPANT AND SPORT. THANK YOU SIR. STEPHANIE KLEIN FROM CARMICHAEL AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS DOCUMENT. HI MY NAME IS CHRISTY CASTILLO I AM A NURSE DIABETES EDUCATOR AND OF ALL THE LIQUID TYPE ONE DIABETES FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. PRIOR TO SEEGM ACCESS I A.

WHICH I WAS ABLE TO KEEP MY BLOOD SUGARS SAFE AND MAKE TREATMENT DECISIONS APPROPRIATELY WITH INSULIN. DOING SO WITH ALL ALLOWED ME TO MEET MY OWN PERSONAL GOALS WHICH I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN LAST YEAR RUNNING A MARATHON WHICH WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT CGM THERAPY. SO I WAS AFFORDED THIS GREAT TOOL TAKE CARE FOR MYSELF SO I CAN LIVE WELL EVERYONE SHOULD GET THIS OPPORTUNITY THERE SHOULD BE NO DISPARITY AMONG ANYONE.

IT IS ALLOWED ME TO ON. MATT WELL JUST CONTROL MY BLOOD SUGARS IT'S ALLOWED I CARRY THIS DEVICE WITH ME ALL THE TIME. I HAVE A CONNECTED TO MY IPHONE. I CAN LOOK AT THIS EVERY MOMENT OF THE DAY AND KNOW WHAT MY BLOOD SUGARS ARE. YOUR BLOOD SUGARS THOUGH IT'S THEY STAGNANT THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE DAY THEY CHANGE AND IT ALLOWED ME. TO SEE THE TRENDS AND MAKE THOSE CITING CHANGES LIKE AVOID HYPOGLYCEMIA OR AVOID THE HIGHS AND BRING IT DOWN. BUT THE HARDEST THING FOR ME IS AS A DIABETES EDUCATOR NOT BEING ABLE TO GIVE THAT. THIS TOOL TO MY PATIENTS SADLY ONE OF MY AND THIS IS ONE STORY OF MANY WE SHARED BUT SADLY ONE OF MY PATIENTS WAS ON THE MEDI CAL. COVERAGE DIDN'T WAS DENIED THIS TOOL NUMEROUS TIMES. HE DIDN'T GATHERED AND TELL CLOSE TO THE END OF HIS LIFE WHEN HE FINALLY GOT IT AND THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE GOT THIS WAS AMAZING IT WAS A TOOL LIKE HEAT I WISHED HE WOULD HAVE HAD IT BEFORE. AND THE HARDEST THING FOR ME AS I SAID IS ALL THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT CURRENTLY ARE BIG THAT NIGHT THIS. SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU. TO HAVE THIS INCLUDED IN THE MEDI CAL BUDGET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME BEGIN.

IMAGINE A PILOT FLYING A PLANE BLINDFOLD ADDED AND ONLY GETTING TO TAKE OFF THE BLINDFOLD ONCE EVERY FOUR HOURS. THAT'S WHAT MANAGING DIABETES WITHOUT SEJAM AS LIKE AS WE KNOW IT IS THE STANDARD OF CARE. AND ALMOST ALL PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS AND MEDICARE COVER IT NOT ONLY IS IT COST EFFECTIVE AS WE'VE HEARD. IN TERMS OF REDUCE SAYING THAT MONEY SPENT ON HOSPITALIZATIONS DUE TO SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA. SWALLOWS LACK OF PRODUCTIVITY AND LONG TERM COMPLICATIONS BUT IT ALSO IMPROVES SHORT TERM QUALITY OF LIFE. BEING ABLE TO MEASURE YOUR TIME IN RANGE AND BLOOD SUGAR THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS THE METRIC THAT REALLY DICTATES A PERSON'S QUALITY OF LIFE WITH DIABETES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ACUMEN. HELLO I'M LISA MURDOCH REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL I HAD A BROTHER WHO PASSED AWAY DURING AN INCIDENT OF A SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA TWENTY YEARS AGO. I WOULD HAVE LOVED FOR HIM TO HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WHO NEEDS IT HAS ASKED. THE GAME. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRIS STEEL I DROVE UP FROM SAN DIEGO FOR THIS HEARING. I'VE HAD TYPE ONE DIABETES FIFTY EIGHT YEARS. IN NINETEEN SIXTY WHEN I WAS DIAGNOSED BY PAUL WOULD DRIVE ME TO THE HOSPITAL SATURDAY MORNING THAT DROP BUT TELL ME TUESDAY AFTERNOON WHAT WHAT MY SATURDAY MORNING BLOOD SUGAR WAS AS IF I COULD DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. BY THE YOU KNOW. THE CGM IS A TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENT IT SAY'S SAVE MY LIFE MANY TIMES. SINCE I STARTED ON IT IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND INCLUDING LAST NIGHT I ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE HEARING BECAUSE OF AN INCIDENT YESTERDAY SO. YOU SEE MY LIFE LAST NIGHT AND I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD. HAVE ACCESS TO THIS TECHNOLOGY IF THEY HAVE DIABETES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR. I. HELLO MY NAME IS LORRAINE STEEL I AM THE PROUD SPOUSE OF KRIS DE L. FROM SAN DIEGO. AND. FOR THE PERSON WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES IT IS A LIFE SAVER. FOR THE CAREGIVER THE SPOUSE THE FAMILY MEMBER IT IS SUCH PEACE OF MIND YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR LOVED ONES.

I'VE HAD TO PULL MY HUSBAND OUT OF THE LIFE THREATENING LOW. I'VE HAD PARAMEDICS AT OUR HOUSE TOO MANY TIMES TO COUNT. BUT MUST SAY THAT THAT HAS REALLY CHANGEDWITH THE CGM. AND I SEE OUR RIFF SAN DIEGO PARAMEDICS FAR FEWER TIMES EACH YEAR. I KIND OF MISS THOSE HUNKY FIREMAN IN MY BEDROOM AT THREE IN THE MORNING. FROM TIME TO TIME BUT THE REALITY IS. IT IS SAVING MY HUSBAND'S LIFE THE CGM AND IT IS A SHAME IF THERE ARE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO GET. THIS LIFESAVING TREATMENT SO THANK YOU SO MUCH HERE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KRISTA MCEWAN AND I'M FROM SAN DIEGO I'VE HAD TYPE ONE DIABETES AND HOW FAR. COMING UP ON FOURTEEN YEARS. DIABETES IS A CHALLENGING DISEASE BECAUSE OUR MANY FACTORS ON THE PACK MY BLOOD SUGAR. SO MANY OF THE OTHER FEELS LIKE IT CAN ALMOST CONSUMES ME. FINGER PRICKS. CANNOT PROVIDE THE SAME BENEFITS OF A CDM. HAVING. CONTINUOUS UPDATES ON MY. ON HOW MY BLOOD SUGARS DOING HAS CHANGED MY BEHAVIOR IN THE WAY THAT I MANAGE MY DIABETES BETTER. BECAUSE IT IS MORE TANGIBLE. THIS OF I SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR A VULNERABLE POPULATION. SUCH AS THE MEDI CAL PATIENTS. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT QUALITY CARE AND APPROVING THIS FUNDING BUT IT KEEP US ON THAT PATH. THANK YOU THEY CAN. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS USE LEER CAME OVER HERE FROM SAN DIEGO TO SHOW SUPPORT. AND I REALLY CAN'T. SAY ANYTHING BETTER THAN ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE ON THIS ISSUE HAVE SAID FOR THE FACTS OR STATISTICS SAID. BUT THAT MEANS SAID EVERYBODY IN HERE PROBABLY HAS. AT SOME POINT OF THEIR TIME AT A LEVEL ONE OR FAMILY MEMBER FRIEND. THAT IS. CREE DIABETIC MAYBE DIABETIC AND. THIS WILL AFFECT. PRETTY MUCH SOMEWHERE YOU'LL KNOW YOU'RE GUARANTEED.

YOU CAN SEE HOW IT REALLY CHANGES PEOPLE'S LIVES AND. JUST THE FACT THAT TO SAVE SO MUCH MONEY IS. ONE HUGE THING IN. DIDN'T SOME THAT'S REALLY GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO BE ALIVE ISN'T OF THIS. PRAYER THE NEXT WE'RE JUST IMPORTANT SO. PLEASE GIVE. ALL THESE PEOPLE JUST THAT. STANDARD MEDICAL. RIGHT TO HAVE A. THE MONITOR. AND. THERE'S COMMON SAYING WHAT GETS. WHAT GETS MEASURE GETS MANAGED AND THIS IS CAMERAMAN'S ME THAT WHAT GETS? MONITORED GETS. MANAGE SO PEOPLE CAN JUST. LIVE A SOMEWHAT NORMAL LIFE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU SIR. TIM MADDEN REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE MAYOR COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES THREE. WE HAD SEVERAL QUESTIONS WITHIN THE AGENDA AND I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD HAVE. RA NAME BELOW FROM THAT THE AIDS HE ASKED. THOSE QUESTIONS. HELLO THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR NAY MAILLOT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO THERE WERE SEVERAL QUESTIONS THAT I DE EACH CS WAS ASKED TO RESPOND TO. AS I'M JUST GONNA KINDA COMPREHENSIVELY COVER QUESTIONS SO CURRENTLY CDM IS NOT A COVERED MEDI CAL BENEFIT AS HAS BEEN STATED TODAY. I'M IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE A NON COVERED BENEFITS SO THERE ARE PROCESSES IN PLACE WHEREBY FOR NON COVERED BENEFITS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. PEOPLE CAME REQUEST UP PHYSICIANS CAN REQUEST THOSE SERVICES USING PAR AUTHORIZATION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE WARRANTED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH AYE SUPPORTERS OF THIS PROPOSAL. IS THAT WE'RE WORKING TO PUT OUT SOME ADDITIONAL CRITERIA AND OUR MEDICAL PROVIDER MANUALS TO HELP EDUCATE THE PROVIDERS HOW TO SUBMIT REQUESTS FOR THE SERVICES USUALLY USING SPECIAL HANDLING. REQUIREMENTS OF THOSE AYE TARBERT QUEST AND TOWARDS OUR TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION REQUEST BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING ABOUT BE PAR AUTHORIZED UNDER THE DEPARTMENT. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT PROVIDERS WOULD HAVE TO SUBMIT THE TAURUS ELECTRONICALLY SO WE'RE LOOKING TO RELEASE AN AUTOMATIC CAO PROVIDER BULLETIN AROUND MID MAY. SOME CRITERIA TO HELP PROVIDERS IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS IS THAT THEY NEED TO DO TO SUBMIT THOSE CARS SO THAT THOSE POWERS CAN THEN BE DIRECTED. TO MEDICAL STAFF WITHIN THE PROGRAM TO LOOK AT THE REVIEW AND. MAKE DETERMINATIONS BASED UPON MEDICAL NECESSITY THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE CCS ELIGIBLE CONDITIONS WHO MAY BE AUTHORIZED FOR THE SERVICES AND ONCE THEY ONCE THEY AGE OUT OF THE CCS PROGRAM. THAT HOW IT THOSE SERVICES BE COVERED AGAIN BASED UPON THE SUBSTANTIATION UP PROMESAS CITY ONCE THE A DOT OF THE PROGRAM IT WOULD BE PAR AUTHORIZED. AND THEN THAT REQUEST WILL COME INTO THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE DOCUMENTATION TO DEMONSTRATE MEDICAL NECESSITY. BECAUSE IT'S A NON COVERED BENEFIT TODAY IT IS LIKELY THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE MEDICAL PROGRAMS THAT HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS BENEFIT. BUT AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN ADDRESS THAT THROUGH. CLEAR DIRECTIONSFOR HOW TO REQUEST SERVICES FOR BENEFITS OUT AMONG COVERED UNDER THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AND WE HAVE NOT. BECAUSE AGAIN THAT THE WAY IT'S ADMINISTERED UNDER OUR PROGRAM WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DISPARITIES IN TERMS OF REQUEST COMING AND OR HOW SERVICES ARE BEING AUTHORIZED. THE OTHER THING I DID WANT TO MAKE MENTION OF. IS THAT WITH THE MEDICAL POPULATION TODAY ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT ARE ON MANAGE THROUGH MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS SO OUR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS BECAUSE IT'S NOT HE COVERED BENEFIT. DO HAVE THE ABILITY SHOULD THEY DESIRE TO MAKE THIS BENEFIT AVAILABLE TO THE BENEFICIARIES THAT THEY SERVE BUT THEY DO HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL. THE ABILITY TO MANAGE THAT CONTINUUM OF CARE NEEDS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS INCLUDING DIABETES AND SO THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SO. THAT'S KIND OF THE CORNERSTONE OF THE WORK THAT MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS DO AS HELPING TO MANAGE AND THAT I'M LEAST RESTRICTIVE WAY LEAST COSTLY MANNER IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS. AND WHAT THAT I WELCOME ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SO. THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF THAT THAT. I'M STRUGGLING WITH BUT. MAYBE I'LL GIVE MYSELF A MINUTE AND ALLOW DOCTOR WOULD TO GO FIRST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR. COMMENTS AB COUPLE COUPLE QUESTIONS SO. I MISTER GRAY TALKED ABOUT A CASE WORD AND. WHERE DR? DESCRIBES FOR PATIENT. WENT TO ALL WHICH UNIT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE THEY OVERTURNED THAT. SEEM TO BE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL CERTAINTY OR OUR MEDICAL NEED IN A CASE LIKE THAT BUT I AM CURIOUS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THESE PRETREATMENT THESE PRIVATIZATIONS. HOW WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT? A FLAW APPLY FOR A PRE AUTHORIZATION THAT ACTUALLY GET THE DEVICE. I DON'T HAVE THAT DATA I CAN MAKE THAT AVAILABLE. YOU YOU CAN OKAY I CAN GO BACK AND HAVE STAFF LOOK AT A AND I AM PUZZLED YOU KNOW WITH WITH. LIKE THE YOUNG LADY HERE. THE ELOQUENTLY YOUNG LADY OF WHAT I. YOU KNOW SHE'S GONNA SHE'S GONNA FACE A POINT WHEN SHE TURNS EIGHTEEN AND IS NO LONGER COVERED WITH CCS. PEOPLE OF TYPE ONE DIABETES DON'T AGE OUT OF TYPE ONE DIABETES. SO WHY WOULD THEY HAVE TO THEN GO TO ANOTHER PROCESS. TO ASSIST TO ASCERTAIN THE MEDICAL NECESSITY FOR THE DEVICE THAT THEY'VE BEEN USING. UNDER THE CCS PROGRAM I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SO BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE BENEFIT IS COVERED TODAY SOMEONE AT THE NON COVERED BENEFIT ABOUT WHEN WE LOOK AT. CGM IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND FOR MOST DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT THAT IS COVERED BY THE MEDIC CAO PROGRAM. PAR AUTHORIZATION IS REQUIRED SO IT'S JUST THE SUBSTANTIATION AND RECOGNIZE SEEN. WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE COVERED UNDER THE MATTER HOW PROGRAM WHEN THEY ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE AS A CHILD THEY ARE CONSIDERED. I'M ELIGIBLE UNDER WHAT WE CALL E. PIASKI T. EARLY PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS. AND TREATMENT SERVICES SO THOSE SERVICES HAVE AN EXPANDED MEDICAL NECESSITY REQUIREMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME FOR ADULTS ONCE THEY EIGHT OUT OF. BEING TWENTY ONE AMBIEN AT BEING CONSIDERED A CHILD UNDER THE MEDICAL PROGRAM SO THERE'S A DIFFERENT STANDARD OF MEDICAL NECESSITY BUT AS AN ADULT WE DO LOOK AT. WHAT WAS SAPE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED AND THEN BASED UPON WHAT'S COVERED UNDER OUR PROGRAM FOR A IN THIS INSTANCE IF IT'S AMONG COVERED BENEFIT? AGAIN WE WOULD LOOK AT THE SUBSTANTIATION OF SAY PRIOR NEED AND THEN USE THAT INFORMATION TO THEM MAKE A DETERMINATION OF ONGOING MEDICAL NECESSITY. SO THEN I GUESS MY FINAL QUESTION IS. WHITE Y. SCOUT IS SO MANY OTHER STATES HAVE THIS IS PART OF THE PROGRAM AND THEIR PROGRAMS WHY WHITE Y. WHEAT Y. WE NOT DOING THIS WE SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON TREATMENT. AND INSTEAD OF PREVENTING SOME OF THE EPISODES THAT DRIVE PEOPLE TO EMERGENCY ROOMS THAT BRING OUT FIRST RESPONDERS. WHAT WHAT WHAT AM I MISSING HERE WHITE WHAT? WHY IT WHY ARE WE NOT INVESTING IN THESE THESE KINDS OF DEVICES THAT CAN REALLY HELP PEOPLE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND SAVE US MONEY ON THE OTHER END I'M I'M? A MISSING SOMETHING HELP ME UNDERSTAND SO I THINK PART OF IT IS LOOKING AT BECAUSE THERE'S MANY DEVICES THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY WE IS THE PROGRAM BECAUSE IT IS A PUBLICLY FINANCED PROGRAM. WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE DEVICES THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS. SEE THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED BASED UPON SAY PEER REVIEWED JOURNALS EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE SO THIS IS SOMETHING AGAIN BROUGHT TAR TENSION WE'VE HAD THE DISCUSSIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THIS WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS USE THE DATA THAT WILL COME INTO LAST ONCE WE PUT OUT THIS INFORMATION. FOR HOW ON PROVIDERS CAN REQUEST THIS BENEFIT TO GET MORE INFORMATION IN TERMS OF HOW WE MAY LOOK TO COVER THIS IF IT IS DETERMINED EITHER THROUGH THIS BODY OR THROUGH OTHER MEANS OF US COVERING THIS AS A COVERED BENEFIT UNDER THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. BUT. OKAY AND I'D SPOT COMMEND YOU MR GRAY AFTER YOUR PERSISTENCE ON THIS I MEAN YOU HAD UNANIMOUS SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR AND. I THINK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED WORK ON THIS. I'M GONNA ADD MY BIASES WELL AND. IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME I'D LIKE TO SHARE A PERSONAL STORY MY FATHER IN LAW SUFFERS FROM DIABETES THAT. HE GOT FROM EXPOSURE TO AGENT ORANGE IN THE VIETNAM WAR. AND HE. STRUGGLES OFTENTIMES TO HELP TO CONTROL HIS BLOOD SUGARS AS WELL. AND BUREAUCRACY THROUGH THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HAS. FORCED HIM TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEM TO PURCHASE A CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITOR HIMSELF. AND WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE DEPARTMENT NOW HAS ECHOES OF THAT SAME BARACK. AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHEN WE HAVE A EVIDENCE BASED. A MONITOR THAT'S IN FRONT OF US THAT REALLY DOES HELP TO. EXPAND SERVICES INCREASED TREATMENT INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE DISEASE PROCESS. WIRE WE AS A STATE NOT FUNDING THIS PROGRAM NOW. AND WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM US AS A LEGISLATURE TO SHOW OUR INTEREST IN THE STATION. IN THIS ISSUE AND WANTING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE. NOW COVER THIS AS AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT. I MEAN I THINK THE INTEREST HAS BEEN CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED HERE IN THIS HEARING AND AND THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO THE DEPARTMENT. WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION TO OUR. SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF SO THAT WE MAY UNDERSTAND THE COST THAT IS BEFORE US AND MAKE SURE THAT. ANYTHING ANY INFORMATION THAT WE NEED PRIOR TO MY REVISION IS PRESENT SO THAT WE CAN. GIVE THIS PROPOSAL. UP ALL THE DUE DILIGENCE THAT IS NECESSARY. YES THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. APPRECIATE THE. IN DEPTH DISCUSSION IMPORTANT ISSUE ARE. SOME OF THE ANSWERS FRANKLY AT THAT WE GET OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION PARTNERS. PARTICULAR ISSUE JUST BECOME INSULT INSULTING TO OUR INTELLIGENCE I INSULT TO THIS COMMITTEE. A. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT BOTH TUGS AT OUR HEARTSTRINGS BUT ALSO MAKES SENSE FOR OUR WALLETS WE SAVE MONEY WE SAVE LIVES. TOM THIS IS ALSO A PERSONAL ISSUE. FOR ME AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR I HAVE TO MEMBERS OF MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY. WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM TYPE ONE DIABETES MY MOTHER GOT UP SIXTY EIGHT TIMES A NIGHT FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS? UP UNTIL MY SISTER WENT TO COLLEGE AND I THINK SHE STILL GETS UP AND CHECKS THE. NOW MONITOR ON THE CELLPHONE. THANKS TO THIS SITE. NEW AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES BUT TO DENY THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AYE IS IMMORAL. A IT'S COSTING THE STATE MONEY AYE EVERY OTHER PRIVATE SECTOR PROGRAM AND MOST OTHER STATES WOULD BE DOING THIS IF THAT WEREN'T TRUE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THE COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. WHEN THIS COMES FOR YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY AND WITH THAT WE WILL ISSUE THREE OPEN. WE'RE NOT GOING TO SKIP AHEAD TO ISSUE SEVEN AND FOR THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WHO ARE WAITING I APOLOGIZE BUT WE HAVE A WITNESS WHO NEEDS TO LEAVE. SO APOLOGIES I WITH READY AT THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS MY NAME IS FRED NO WHEREIN WE HAVE REPRESENTED THE A LS ASSOCIATION FOR OVER TEN YEARS. WE HEARD TODAY FOR A BUDGET REQUEST. I THINK EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS VERY WELL THAT A DIAGNOSIS DIAGNOSIS OF LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE IS A REAL TOUGH. TOUGH DIAGNOSIS ENDA WITH ME TODAY IS FRED FISHER THE PRESIDENT CEO OF THE ASSOCIATION. AND OUR GOOD FRIEND RUSTY SEE LEX WHO WAS RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH A LS. WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THE NUMBERS OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE A LS ARE GROWING IN CALIFORNIA. THE CASELOAD IS GROWING FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE IS PEOPLE ARE LIVING LONGER. AND JUST OVERALL WITH EACH WITH THE OVERALL INCREASE IN THE POPULATION. OF THE NUMBERS ARE GROWING AND THE ASSOCIATION WHICH PROVIDE SO MANY ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO PEOPLE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH THE DISEASE. IS NOT ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THAT GROWING DIM DEMAND. ITEM I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT. WE'RE DISTRIBUTING A MEMO FROM MAYOR STEINBERG OF SACRAMENTO. A HE WAS A WONDERFUL A CHAMPION OF OF. OF HOURS WHEN HE WAS THE SENATE PASSED A BILL IN FIFTY IN THEM. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SENATE BILL FIFTY NO THREE THAT SET FORTH IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE THE OPTIMAL MODEL OF CARE. WHICH THE LS ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN ABLE TO REPLICATE AROUND THE STATE. AND. MAYBE I'LL JUST TURN OVER TO MISTER FISHER AND TELL FROM THEIR. THANK YOU FOR HEARING. CHILDREN ARAMBULA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO THE LARGEST AIR LESS PATIENT POPULATION IN NORTH AMERICA. AND THE A OR ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA'S THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST PROVIDER OF COMMUNITY AND HOME BASED SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIA'S AIRWEST COMMUNITY. SP FIFTEEN NO THREE SPONSORED BY SENATOR STEINBERG ESTABLISHED AN EVIDENCE BASED SYSTEM OF CARE. THAT IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY WAY TO MEANINGFULLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND LENGTH OF LIFE. PEOPLE LIVING WITH A LESS INCLUDING THOSE WHO WERE DIAGNOSED AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE FAMILY MEMBERS AND CAREGIVERS. THE SYSTEM IS BASED ON A SET OF ROBUST CLINIC COMMUNITY AND HOME BASED SERVICES CREATING ACCESS TO A FULL WRAPAROUND MODEL OF CARE. AND LONGER AND DIE TYPICALLY WITHIN THREE YEARS AFTER DIAGNOSIS IN THEIR HOMES. THE SYSTEM WHICH IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN AIRWEST ASSOCIATION CERTIFY TREATMENT CENTERS AND AFFILIATED MEDICAL CLINICS WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS COVERED BY MEDICARE AND OTHER THIRD PARTY PAYORS. THIS COVERAGE ONLY AMOUNTS TO ABOUT TEN PERCENT. THE COST. THE REMAINDER IS COVERED BY PHILANTHROPY. WHICH MEANS THAT THE AWACS COMMUNITY IS UNDERWRITING ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THE COST OF THEIR CARE. THE DRAMATIC GROWTH IN THE AIR WEST PATIENT POPULATION A STRAIN THE SYSTEM TO THE BREAKING POINT. PHILANTHROPY BRIAN FROM THE AWACS COMMUNITY CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH THE GROWING DEMANDS FOR SERVICES AND SUPPORT. CALIFORNIA'S NOW WARRANT LEADER NEUROGENIC DISEASE SCIENCE. AND IS NOW WORLD LEADER IN A LESS CARE. IT CREATES A FULL BENCH TO BEDSIDE PLATFORM. THROUGH WHICH EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS AND CURES ARE TESTED FOR A O. S. AND RELATED DISORDERS. THOSE LIVING WITH THIS DISEASE NEED THE STATE'S HELP IN UNDERWRITING THE SYSTEM OF CARE THAT WILL ENABLE THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO PURSUE PROGRESS. WHILE ENABLING THE ONE IN FOUR HUNDRED WHO WILL BE DIAGNOSED. INCLUDING VETERANS WHO CONTRACT A WEST AT TWICE THE RATE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT FROM THE ONLY TREATMENT THAT WILL HELP THEM LIVE LONGER AND BETTER. THE SYSTEM OF CARE THAT S. BE FIFTEEN OH THREE ESTABLISHED. AND ARE BUDGET REQUEST WILL ASSIST IN FUNDING. Q. A MISTER CHAIRMAN RUSTY SEAL ACCEPT PATIENTS WITH IOS. AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR IN EACH OF THE PREVIOUS THIRTY YEARS I. CAME BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES. IRONICALLY THOSE ARE PERFECT PARALLEL IN THAT CHAIR STEINBERG OF COURSE WAS ARE CHAMPION FROM ON HOW. THE FIRST STEP HAD BEEN. LEGISLATION LIKE THIS CREATING THE SYSTEM A CURRENT STATUTE THE NEXT STEP WAS FUNDING AND THAT'S WHAT HE AND I DID TOGETHER FOR MANY YEARS. BUT THE PARALLEL EXTENDS THE FACT THAT WE KNEW WITH PEOPLE NOW UNLESS IT'S WHATEVER IT TAKES. AND WHAT THEY'LL LAST WENT ALRIGHT FACE WHEN ALL OF US WHEN THEY LOST FACE. IS THAT THERE IS A FUNCTIONAL RATING SCALE ON TWELVE ASPECTS OF DAILY LIVING. AND WE DECLINE AN AVERAGE POINT A MONTH. SO EVERY MONTH WE HAVE A NEW CHALLENGE OF SOMETHING THAT WE USED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WE CAN'T ANYMORE. AND HOW DO WE MANAGE OUR LIFE AND HOW TO WE ADJUSTED. ON THAT NEW CHALLENGE. THIS EL LAST CLINIC MODEL WHERE EVERY THREE MONTHS WE SEE THE CLINIC TEAM. OF. YEAH SIX PEOPLE SAY YES OVER THREE HOUR VISIT. WHEN I FIRST STARTED GETTING THOSE BENEFITS LAST SUMMER I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WASN'T ALL COVERED BY INSURANCE WAS ONLY WHEN I LEARNED THAT.

AT A TIME WE'RE HAVING THESE KEY DEBATES IN LEGISLATURE ABOUT EXPANDING UPON THE WITH GREAT WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE IN TERMS OF PROVIDING GREATER HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. OUR OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT HOUSE ME AND OUR PARTNERS IN THE SPACE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIANS SEEKING ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE HAVE AN EFFICIENT MECHANISM IN PLACE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR PROVIDERS TO ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM DELIVERS THE BEST POSSIBLE HEALTH OUTCOMES. REGARDLESS OF A PATIENT'S LANGUAGE OR ETHNICITY. NOW WHEN THE BILL PASSED THE BUDGET PROCESS TWO YEARS AGO WE ARE EXCITED TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE VALUABLE MEDICAL INTERPRETATION SERVICES. TO THOSE CALIFORNIA'S INDEED AND WERE ALSO. ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE IF THE PROGRAM COULD WORK. OUT WE BELIEVE THAT THESE FOR OUR MINOR ADJUSTMENTS MENTIONED BY MISTER BONTA.

VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AS CO CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE RARE DISEASE CAUCUS I JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA. IN SUPPORTING A BUDGET REQUEST FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR A CLINICAL PILOT PROJECT TO DEMONSTRATE BOTH THE PRINT PRECISION DIAGNOSTIC AND FINANCIAL VALUE OF CLINICAL WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING. FOR THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT PROJECT WILL BE TO TEST A MINIMUM OF ONE HUNDRED MEDI CAL NEONATAL ANOTHER PEDIATRIC PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM ON. DIAGNOSE DISEASES THAT OF REMAIN UNDIAGNOSED OR HAD MULTIPLE DIAGNOSES HUSING CW GEASS TO PRODUCE PROCESS PRECISE CONDITION DIAGNOSES AND TARGETED TREATMENT PATHWAYS. THE PROJECT WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE AND TRANSPARENT BY REPORTING TEST RESULTS QUARTERLY INCLUDING HOW DIAGNOSES WERE REVISED AND TREATMENT PASSED PATHWAYS ALTERED THE PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE. IN MEDI CAL COMPARED TO CURRENT STANDARDS OF NEWBORN AND PEDIATRIC HEALTH CARE ASSESSMENTS SCREENINGS ARE TASKS ADDITIONALLY THIS CLINICAL PILOT PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE MEDICARE WOULD BENEFIT FINANCIALLY. AND MEDICARE PATIENTS WOULD BENEFIT CLINICALLY FOR IMPROVEMENT ACCELERATED ACCESSIBILITY AND COST EFFECTIVE AND. EFFECTIVENESS OF ADOPTION OF DEBBIE GS WHEN COMPARED TO SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES FOR PATIENT DIAGNOSTIC ODYSSEYS AND COSTLY INEFFECTIVE TREATMENTS IT WILL ADVANCE PRECISION MEDICINE IN CALIFORNIA BY DEMONSTRATING THE CURRENT COST EFFECTIVE AVAILABILITY OF TECHNOLOGY. TO IDENTIFY DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE GENETIC CONDITIONS IN THE MEDICAL POPULATION TO MORE EFFECTIVELY GUIDE CLINICIAN TREATMENTS THE CHIEF OF GENOMICS MEDICINE AT UC DAVIS SAID IT SIMPLY IN A RECENT ARTICLE MEDI CAL AND OTHER FORMS OF STATE A. REALLY VIEWED XIN GENOMIC SEQUENCING AS EXPERIMENTAL SO IT'S NOT BEING COVERED. GENOMIC SEQUENCING IS NOT EXPERIMENTAL ANYMORE THIS REQUEST WILL ESTABLISH A PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. SO IT MAY CONSTANTLY MOVE FOR WITH ESTABLISHING IT AS A COVERED BENEFIT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK. THE SUBCOMMITTEE APPROVE THIS REQUEST AND ALONG WITH A SUM IN MY SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA WE ALSO HAVE A DOCTOR DAVID DIMOCK. THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE FOR GENOMIC MEDICINE READY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN SAN DIEGO JOHN AND JOHN VALENCIA RESENT RESENT REPRESENTING ALUMINA HEADQUARTERED IN SAN DIEGO. AND LARGE FAR NAY IS THAT DOCTOR LARGE FURNACE TIME AT THE M. GAVE AT RATED CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA WOULD. THANK YOU SOME OF THE REMAIN CHINA OUGHT TO BE A A CO CHAIR OF THE. CALIFORNIA RARE DISEASE CAUCUS WITH YOU AND WHICH WILL EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL I THINK WE CAN REALLY BENEFIT THE MEDICAL PROGRAM FINANCIALLY AS WAS MENTIONED COULD BENEFIT. OF PATIENTS CLINICALLY IN MY OWN DISTRICT IN OAKLAND CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IS THE EAST BAY'S LARGEST PEDIATRIC SPECIALTY CARE CENTER. AT BUILT JUST FOR KIDS EGGMAN CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE THESE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE BEST. STANDARD OF CARE THE MEDICAL PROGRAM CAN REASONABLY PROVIDE. IN THE PAST I THINK GENOME SEQUENCING HAS BEEN SEEN AS AN INVESTIGATIONAL OR EXPERIMENTAL AND WE SHOULDN'T SEE IT ASAP. ANYMORE THIS IS A A A PILOT PROJECT THAT CAN REALLY DEMONSTRATE THE TRUE VALUE. ADD TO OUR OUR PATIENTS IN MANY CAL SO I I WANNA THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS I THINK IT'S A MODEST PROPOSAL WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR TREMENDOUS IMPACT FOR OUR PATIENTS TO SAVE MONEY. AND PROVIDE GREAT CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND RESPECT WE ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER SUPPORTING THANK YOU. SIR. I'M DAVID ULTIMA CLINICAL GENETICISTS BY TRAINING AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR THE GENOME INSTITUTE. THE PROPOSAL IS A RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD WHAT TO SEQUENCE THE MINIMUM OF HUNDRED CHILDREN AT LEAST TWO OTHER CENTERS. AT OUR INSTITUTION WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF PHILANTHROPY THAT HAS ENABLED US TO STOP THE PROGRAM PERSONAL TOLL WITH PROPOSING. WE JUST RECENTLY PUBLISHED A PRELIMINARY DATA ON OFFICE FORTY TWO CHILDREN THAT WE SEQUENCED. WE DEMONSTRATED CONSERVATIVELY EIGHT HNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN COST SAVINGS. ONE SIX PERCENT OF OUR CHILDREN AROUND A Q. OUR. HOME SUCCESSFUL MEDI CAL FROM INFANTS. AND. IT IS WORTH NOTING THE GENETIC DISORDERS WOULD REPRESENT ABOUT SIX TO SEVENTEEN ADMISSIONS TO NICK HUGHES AND CALIFORNIA ON A GIVEN DAY. THIS PROPOSAL IT'S TRANSPARENT IN PROVIDING QUARTERLY CHECK INS. ON WE WILL MEAN TO STICK WITH AS MANY CHILDREN AS WE CAN THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES TOM. THE SET UP THE CONTENT IN THE BOND HOSPITALS. WHICH OF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE GETTING THAT TELLS INFO. AND INCLUDES FUNDING TO PROVIDE DATA COLLECTION TO UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF GENOMIC SEQUENCING AND NANITES. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US MY NAME IS LOW THE FARMHOUSE I AM ONE OF THE PHYSICIANS AT THE. CHILDREN'S INSTITUTE FOR GENOMIC MEDICINE. I AM TRAINED IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE IN PEDIATRIC HEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY. I'D ORIGINALLY BECAME A PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGIST BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THOSE WERE THE SICKEST OF THE SICK CHILDREN BUT THE REALITY IS THIS THOSE CHILDREN. HAVE A LOT A LARGE CARE NETWORK AND THEY'VE HAD GREAT OUTCOMES DUE TO THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES THAT WE HAVE MADE. MANY CHILDREN WITH GENETIC DISEASE ARE NOT DIAGNOSED IN THE NEWBORN PERIOD AND DIE FOR UNKNOWN REASONS THESE WILL BE CHILDREN THAT DIED OF CULTURE NEGATIVE SUBSETS OR OR ANOTHER. ARBITRARY DIAGNOSIS. WE FOUND THAT WITH THE APPLICATION OF A RELATIVELY LIMITED SET OF EXCLUSION CRITERIA TO IT LEMONADE CHILDREN SUCH AS THOSE WHO HAVE ISOLATED PRE MATURITY. OR INFECTION WITHIN WITHIN IDENTIFIED ORGANISM. IF WE SEQUENCE EVERYBODY ELSE THAT'S LEFT OVER THAT DOESN'T HAVE A CLEAR DIAGNOSIS WE STILL COME UP WITH A GENETIC DIAGNOSIS IN ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO A THIRD OF THE PATIENTS. BEFORE GENETIC DISEASE WAS EVEN SUSPECTED. THIS ALLOWS US TO INTERVENE THIS ALLOWS US TO HELP THESE CHILDREN. WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS PROPOSAL WILL SAVE LIVES THERE WILL BE CHILDREN IN THE STUDY THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE DIED OR BEEN NEUROLOGICALLY DEVASTATED. WHO WILL BE SAVED? PEOPLE BECOME VERY NERVOUS ABOUT. DOING A WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCE ON A NEWBORN IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT WILL MEAN FOR CHILDREN LATER IN THEIR LIVES WE ONLY I'D TRY TO IDENTIFY THE REASON WHY THAT PATIENT IS SICK RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T ANALYZE FOR IF THERE IS AN INCREASED CHANCE THAT THEY'LL GET BREAST CANCER WHEN THEY'RE FORTY FIVE. IF THERE'S AN INCREASED RISK OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WE LOOK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY IS THIS PATIENT SICK IN THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP THEM. THANK YOU SIR MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JOHN VALENCIA REPRESENTED ALUMINA AND A GLOBAL LEADER IN JUNE HUMAN GENOMICS HEADQUARTERED IN SAN DIEGO. I WANT TO EXPRESS OUR DEEP APPRECIATION TO THE CO CHAIRS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE RARE DISEASE CAUCUS FOR SPONSORING THIS PROPOSAL ALONG WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA. KICKED OFF THE INTEREST AS BOTH MEMBERS OF STATED THIS IS WHAT THE COMMITTEE SO OFTEN ASK FOR AND THAT IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT BEFORE A LARGER INVESTMENT. ON THIS SMALL INVESTMENT WE EXPECTED EXTRAORDINARY RETURN WE PRESENTED TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE AS WELL AS THIS COUNTERPART IN THE SENATE WHICH WILL HEAR THE MATTER LATER THIS WEEK. A DETAILED PROPOSAL ALONG WITH THE BUDGET TO SHOW THE EXPECTED INVESTMENT AND THE RETURN BEFORE THE BROADER REQUEST OF COVERAGE WITHIN THE PROGRAM. IT'S A TOOL THAT IS HERE AND NOW IT SOUNDS FUTURISTIC BUT IN CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT ONLY BEEN INNOVATIVE IT'S BEEN REFINED AND WE SHOULD MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THE PROGRAM THE COVERS FIFTY PERCENT OF THE BIRTHS. IN THE STATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE PROUD A PROPOSAL THANK YOU SIR WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FIVE. CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU OLIVER A GREAT CALIFORNIA LIKE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION. PROUD PARTNER CALIFORNIA RARE DISEASE CAUCUS I WANT TO THANK THEM BOTH FOR BRING THIS FORWARD. GENTLEMAN EARLIER SAID IF YOU CAN MEASURE IT YOU COULD TREAT IT AYE THIS IS VERY SIMILAR. THE THE AMOUNT OF UNDIAGNOSED RARE DISEASES THAT COULD BE A TREATED EARLIER ON IN LIFE. OR HAVE TREMENDOUS VALUE IF YOU CAN DO SOME GENOME SEQUENCING SEVEN STRONG SUPPORT OF PROPOSAL AND OUT LOOK FORWARD TO IT MOVING FORTY. THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS THAT WE MAY HAVE. I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION IF IF I MAY DOING. WORKING A LITTLE BIT OF MATH WHILE I WAS HERE BUT. FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT'S TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER GENOMIC SEQUENCING. AND. MINDER STANDING IS THAT TECHNOLOGY IS NOW MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN THAT FIGURE AND SONG TRYING TO. WONDER. IS THERE. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT STATE DOLLARS ARE PAYING THE ACTUAL PRICE FOR THE GENOMIC SEQUENCING? TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU GOT TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS. YEAH BUT SO. THE REPORTER QUESTION SO. TO BE CLEAR WAS TOLD UNITS SEQUENCING HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING COST IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE TO DO A RAPID JEAN OF TRENTON RESULT ROUNDED THREE TO FOUR DAYS. RATHER THAN A MONTH OR TWO MONTHS BECAUSE IT'S RENTS HAVE KILLED MICE FOR SPEED PROBLEM COSTS ABOUT ONE POINT. SECOND ONE WHICH I THINK IS PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT THAT ACTUALLY GETTING A DIAGNOSIS ON A GENOME IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE JOURNEY. AND IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR GENETICALLY AND FORMATS AND TO THINK ABOUT THE TIME TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTATION OF CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT. AS WE LOOK GOING TO BOTH ON THE CHILDREN'S ON TO OAKLAND. THEY HAVE GOOD GENETICS DEPARTMENTS ON BUT DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE PENALTY ON THE FLIGHT TO. RESPOND TO JIM RESULT AS CURRENTLY SIGN UP. THERE IS A NEED TO PROVIDE GENETIC COUNSELING IN THE NECK IS OUT THOSE INSTITUTIONS WHICH REQUIRES PERSONAL TO DO THAT. AND FURTHERMORE THE COST ANALYSIS IN AND OF ITSELF IS VERY LABOR INTENSIVE TO REVIEW THROUGH MEDICAL RECORDS. AND TO DEVELOP WHAT WE CALL COUNTERFACTUAL TRAGIC TRAJECTORIES THAT'S TO SAY. TRYING TO ESTABLISH WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN A RARE DISEASE SITUATION IF WE HADN'T DONE THE GENOME SEQUENCE SO THE BUDGET INCLUDES THE COUNSELING. ASSISTANCE WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF PRECISION MEDICINE AS WELL AS THE GENOME SEQUENCING. IN ITSELF FROM A TENT IN THE BUDGET TO SAY AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED. WE ARE NOT FOR PROFIT WE WILL TO THIS AT COST RECOVERY SO IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY WOULDN'T BUDGET WE WILL STICK WITH SMALL CHILDREN. THANK YOU. AND IT EXCELLENT ANSWER. SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WE WILL HOLD TO ISSUE FIVE OPEN AND THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES AND STAFF THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER ACOSTA FAIR PATIENTS. DOUG ELLIN TAKE OUR TURN AND GET RID OF HERE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. BUT CURRENTLY THERE ARE MORE THAN FOUR MILLION AND PAID FAMILY CARE GIVERS IN CALIFORNIA. THE PP I SEE IS ESTIMATED THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY THE NUMBERS OF SENIORS IN NEED OF IN HOME CARE SERVICES WILL HAVE DOUBLED TO OVER NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND. NOT TAKING IT WOULD COUNT THOSE WILL BE IN NURSING HOMES SOMETHING THAT MOST MIDDLE AND LOW CUT INCOME FAMILIES CANNOT US HOT NOT AFFORD. THE COST FOR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES AND NURSING HOMES CONSUME SIXTEEN NINE POINT SEVEN AND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE PERCENT RESPECTIVELY RESPECTIVELY. OF THE MEDIAN ANNUAL INCOME OF CALIFORNIANS SOMETHING THAT MEDICARE MEDICAID OR UNABLE TO. COVER EFFECTIVELY. THE CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTER IS ALREADY OF PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT CAN BE ADDED ON TO BY CREATING INCENTIVE BASED PILOT PROGRAM FOR YOUNG ADULTS. I AM REQUESTING THAT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE APPROVED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ORDER TO FUND THE CALIFORNIA CARE CORPS PILOT PROGRAM. ESTABLISHING A WORKFORCE FOR THE ELDERLY. THE PROGRAM WILL WORK SYMBIOTICALLY WITH THE CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTERS TO PROVIDE RESPITE CARE TO THOSE IN NEED OF IN HOME CARE FROM LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR HSS. IDEALLY THE PROBLEM THE GEAR FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE INTERESTED IN PURSUING A CAREER IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD BY PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS A MONTHLY STIPEND. THIS PROGRAM WILL ACT AS A TUNNEL BETWEEN SCHOOL AND HEALTH CARE FIELDS FOR STUDENTS TO GAIN REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE. AS WELL AS ENCOURAGE THEM TO MEET THE GROWING NEEDS OF OUR AGING POPULATION BOTH NOW. AND IN THE FUTURE. UNFORTUNATELY MY COAUTHOR ASSEMBLYMAN. EDUARDO GARCIA HAD TO HAD TO LEAVE ARE BUT I DO HAVE. AT ME HEALTH OKAY THEREBY HOPE A PRONOUNCED IT RIGHT AGAIN. HOW FROM THE YOUTH A MOVEMENT AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT AND ALSO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS THANK YOU? THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND I WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS ABOUT THAT SOME WOMEN ACOSTA AND ASSEMBLYMAN GARCIA I'M FOR THEIR BUDGETARY REQUEST. I'M CHAIR DR RAMBLA AND. ESTEEMED MEMBERS MY NAME IS THE HOUSE THAT YOU DAY I AM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS BUDGETARY REQUEST AND ASPIRING PHYSICIAN AND SERVICE THE CEO AND COFOUNDER OF THE YOUTH MOVEMENT AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S AND NONPROFIT THAT STARTED RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IS NOW THE NATIONAL LEADER AND YOU THOUGHT BECAUSE HE AGAINST THIS DISEASE. STUDENTS AND AS MILLENNIALS WE ARE WORRIED THAT THE COST OF CARE WILL OUTGROW MEDICARE AND MEDICAID WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DECADES. AND ARE INVESTED IN VOTING FOR A LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO GLOBAL CHALLENGES THAT IF NOT ADDRESS NOW WILL BE UNIVERSALLY IMPACTFUL AS WE REACH OUR FORTIES AND FIFTIES. AND TODAY WE ARE CREATING JUST SUCH A SOLUTION THIS BUDGETARY REQUEST CALLS FOR A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION TO CREATE THE CALIFORNIA CARE COURT. A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PILOT THAT INCENTIVIZE HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE GRADUATES TO WRITE FULL TIME CARE TO SENIORS WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. FOR. AND THE MANY. UNPAID FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR AMAZING AND MUCH NEEDED PROGRAMS LIKE I JUST SAYS THIS OFFERS A MUCH NEEDED BREAK. THOSE WITH THE DISEASE ARE OFFERED A YOUTHFUL PARTNER TO INJECT SPIRIT AND ENERGY IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. YOUNG INDIVIDUALS LIKE MYSELF ARE OFFERED TREMENDOUS LIFE PERSPECTIVE AND A SKILL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH OUR GROWING AGING POPULATION. AND A POTENTIAL FUTURE CAREER IN CARE SERVICES. THIS IS A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE BUDGETARY ASK CALIFORNIA IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BENEFIT FROM REDUCED BURDEN ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND AS CURRENT CARE GIVERS RE ENTER THE WORKFORCE. IF THE AND THIS CURRENT CAREGIVERS REENTER THE WORKFORCE IF JUST FIFTY PERCENT OF THE RECIPIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM GO BACK TO WORK I MEDIAN SALARY THE STATE WILL BE PAID BACK TEN PERCENT OF COST SIMPLY THROUGH STATE TAXES. IN ADDITION WE WILL HAVE AN ADVISORY BOARD THAT WILL ENSURE OPTIMAL IMPLEMENTATION OF A PILOT. OUR NONPROFIT RECENTLY LAUNCHED YOUTH CARE AN INTERGENERATIONAL RESPITE CARE PROGRAM AT USC. AFTER A TWO YEAR GRANT FUNDED PILOT AT UCLA. WE PARTNER TRAIN COLLEGE STUDENT VOLUNTEERS AND OLDER ADULTS WITH EARLY TO MID STAGE DEMENTIA IN A COMMUNITY BASED SETTING FOR SIX HOURS A WEEK. DURING WHICH TIME CARE GET FAMILY CAREGIVERS ARE GIVEN A BREAK. WE HAVE QUANTIFIABLE DATA TO SHOW BENEFITS FOR ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. THIS BUDGETARY ALLOCATION CREATES A DIRECT COMPETITOR FOR OUR BUSINESS YET OUR ORGANIZATION IS SPONSORING THIS EFFORT AND IS INSPIRING OTHERS TO CREATE SUCH SIMILAR COMPETITORS BECAUSE THE CARE MARKET IS NOT A ZERO SUM GAME. THE REALITY IS THAT THE DEMAND IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE SUPPLY AND THAT WE CANNOT SIMPLY RELY ON FOR PROFIT CARE FOR THE FILE ON THE FOR PROFIT CARE INDUSTRY. TO SERVE ALL FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION OF CALIFORNIA'S UNPAID FAMILY CAREGIVERS. IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THE COUNTRY ONCE AGAIN JUST LIKE IT DID IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS AND IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE ACT. THAT WE ARE STATE THE UNDERSTANDS THAT CARE GIVER ARM ARE AMONGST AMERICA'S UNSUNG HEROES AND WE ARE A STATE THAT IS INNOVATING SAYS INTERGENERATIONAL SOLUTIONS BASED IN COMPASSION FOR THOSE WHO ARE AMONGST OUR MOST VULNERABLE. ESTEEM COMMITTEE TODAY I REQUEST YOU TO PASS THIS BUDGETARY ASK AND JOIN ORGANIZATIONS VISION AS TOGETHER WE CAN CREATE A FUTURE WORTH REMEMBERING THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIX. NIKOLAY TERRACE ON BEHALF OF THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THE GAME. QUIRK SORTS CUTS BEING IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLYMAN EDUARDO GARCIA. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS THAT WE MAY HAVE. SEEING NONE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THIS IT'S. NICE TO HAVE SOME YOUTH ADVOCACY ESPECIALLY ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. I THINK WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX OPEN THANK YOU THANK VERY MUCH MISTER. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE EIGHT SO AGAIN RENEE MONOLOGUE DEPARTMENT OF SO I'VE BEEN ASKED TO RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA. AND THIS IS RELATED TO THE TENTACLE PROGRAM WHICH IS UNDER MY PURVIEW IN THE DEPARTMENT. AND SO THE AND A COMMITTEE HAS ASKED FOR I'M INFORMATION ON THAT CHALLENGES AND PROGRESS MADE ON BURKE GUARDIAN THAT IDENTICAL PROGRAM. AS WELL AS TO. SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THE OUT PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDING. SO FIRST I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHALLENGES SO THERE HAVE BEEN QUITE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN OUR PROGRAM. INCLUDING NEGATIVE AUDIT FINDINGS LOW UTILIZATION RATES FOR CHILDREN ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF ACCESSING PREVENTIVE SERVICES. CHALLENGES WITH PROVIDER PARTICIPATION BOTHAROUND HIM MOMENT PRETEND CHEN AND ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS AND CONFUSION OVER COVER BENEFITS AS WELL AS ONGOING MEDIA ATTENTION. WE HAVE. RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THESE CHALLENGES BUT. IN TERMS OF OUR EFFORTS IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES WITH LEGISLATIVE REPORT I AM PLEASED TO REPORT OUT ON THE FOLLOWING. SO ONE WITH. THE LEGISLATURE WE DID WORK RECEIVE RELIEF FOR DENTAL PROVIDERS FROM A. B. NINETY SEVEN PROVIDER PAYMENT REDUCTIONS AND ALL OF THESE THINGS COLLECTIVELY HAS HELPED TO ON. TURN THE TIDE IN TERMS OF OUR PROGRAM BUT I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE UP FRONT THAT THERE ARE STILL QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO BE DONE. WE ALSO HAVE THE ODD DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE ON THAT AGENDA DID OUTLINE THE COMPONENTS OF THAT. AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IS A SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE PROGRAM. TARGETED TOWARDS PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. I'M AND MAP UP PROJECT IS OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. I'M WE ARE CURRENTLY AND I'M YEAR THREE OF THE PROJECT. AND PART OF THIS EFFORT IS LOOKING AT THE INCREASED UTILIZATION OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. AND SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PROJECT WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE OF SEVEN PERCENT IN TERMS OF PREVENTIVE SERVICE UTILIZATION. MOVIE NOT FROM APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT THREE PERCENT TO FORTY FIVE PERCENT IN TERMS OF UTILIZATION OF SERVICES. WE'VE HAD. WITH LEGISLATIVE. AUTHORIZATION RESTORATION OF ADULT DENTAL SERVICES THOSE WENT INTO A FACT ON JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE'VE ALSO HAD THE PROP FIFTY SIX INVESTMENTS IN THE DELTA CAO PROGRAM. I'M OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A BUDGET YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND ANOTHER SEVENTY MILLION THAT'S PROPOSED. IN THE UPCOMING BUDGET. WE HAVE ALSO WORKED ON. THE I. SPLITTING OUT OF OUR DENTAL FISCAL INTERMEDIARY CONTRACT THAT HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN HELD BY DELTA DENTAL AND SO WE HAVE NOW A SEPARATE FISCAL INTERMEDIARY CONTRACTOR AS WELL AS A NEW ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES I'M CONTRACTOR. AND THIS CONTRACTOR IS I'M CRITICAL IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE ADMINISTRATOR PROGRAM BECAUSE APPROXIMATELY NINETY PERCENT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE DEN ACCOUNT PROGRAM HAS OPERATED UNDER. A FEE FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND WE DO HAVE I MANAGED CARE INTO COUNTY SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES. SO THE ASL CONTRACTOR HAS. SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITIES WITH OVERSIGHT BY THE STATE IN TERMS OF INCREASING OUTREACH TO PROVIDERS BOTH IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE LOW UTILIZATION RATES. AS WELL AS WORK EFFORTS TO UNDERTAKE TO HELP INCREASE PROVIDER PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM. THERE ALSO DIRECTED IN TERMS OF DOING OUTREACH TO BENEFICIARIES AND PROVIDING CASE MANAGEMENT AND CARE COORDINATION. FOR BENEFICIARIES WHEN PROBLEMS ARISE. AND THEN THEY ALSO ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE US WITH ANYA OUTREACH PLANS FOR BENEFICIARIES AND PROVIDERS. WE'VE HAD ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATIONS ONE BEING WITH STREAMLINED PROVIDER. APPLICATIONS WE ARE SEEING THE NEW I'M APPLICATIONS INCREASE PROVIDER MOMENT WE'VE HAD LIKE FORTY FOUR NEW APPLICATIONS COMING INTO LAST. WE'VE ALSO WORKED ON AYE A DECREASING. THE DENTAL TAR I. PROCESSING TIME LINES AND FOR AN AVERAGE OF FIVE DAYS BEFORE IT WAS AROUND TEN TO FIFTEEN DAYS IF NOT LONGER. AND RIGHT NOW BASED UPON DATA THAT WE HAVE FROM OUR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES ORGANIZATION WERE SEEN THAT TARA'S ARE BEING AT HOME APPROVED IN AN AVERAGE BETWEEN ONE TO THREE DAYS. DEPENDING UPON THE DELIVERY SYSTEM OR ABOUT THE PLAN AYE AND WHAT'S THE SERVICES ARE BEING REQUESTED. AND I'M ALSO LOOKING TO MOVE OUR DENTAL PROVIDER APPLICATIONS INTO AN ONLINE APPLICATION PROCESS THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING PILOTED. FOR OUR MEDICAL I'M. PROVIDERS PROOF AYE THAT PARTICIPATE IN OUR PROGRAM. WE ALSO HAVE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF REPORTING THANKS AGAIN TO LEGISLATION BY MEMBER WOULD. UNDER AB TWO TWO OH SEVEN WHEREBY WE ARE DOING MORE UP REPORTING. EXCUSE ME ON ON PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WERE DEVELOPED WITH STAKEHOLDER INPUT. AND ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS POSTED ON AND MEDICAL DENTAL PROGRAM WEB PAGE THAT WE CREATED SPECIFICALLY. TO GIVE INFORMATION ON OUR DENTAL PROGRAM. DATA IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE. OUR AGENCY I'M OPEN DATA PORTAL AND IT DOES INCLUDE DATA BY COUNTY AGENT ETHNICITY. THERE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE BENEFICIARY OUTREACH FOR POPULATIONS ARE NOT I UTILIZING SERVICES AND FOCUSING OUTREACH ON UNDER UTILIZING COUNTIES INCLUDING I'M INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AYE ZERO TO AGE THIRTY. AND IMPROVE THE MESSAGING IN TERMS OF COVER BENEFITS AND HOW TO ACCESS SUCH BENEFITS UNDER OUR PROGRAM. INCLUDING WORKING ON A REVISION OF THE META CAO BENEFICIARY PROVIDER HANDBOOK WHICH IS ALSO POSTED ON OUR WEB PAGE. AND WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT. THROUGH AGAIN LEGISLATION BY SENATOR CANNELLA THAT THERE IS THE DESIRE TO HAVE A GOAL OF ACHIEVING SIXTY PERCENT OR HIGHER. IN TERMS OF UTILIZATION FOR SERVICES AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR STARTING POINT FOR THAT WAS FORTY SEVEN PERCENT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE GOAL THAT WE HAD SET FOR OURSELVES. WITH THE DTI. PROJECT BECAUSE WE WERE STARTING AT A LOW OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT SO OVER THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD WE WERE LOOKING TO INCREASE UTILIZATION BY TEN PERCENT. AND AGAIN. WE ARE SEEN INCREASES IN UTILIZATION FOR CHILDREN THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF THE DTI. AND THEM WERE ALSO. LOOKING AT AND MONITORING I'M UTILIZATION FOR ADULT BENEFICIARIES RIGHT NOW IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL I'M A WET THAT UTILIZATION IS LOOKING LIKE IN TERMS OF THE RESTORATION OF THE ADULT DENTAL BENEFIT. JUST BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION. BUT WE. ARE TRACKING AYE UTILIZATION FOR PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR ADULTS WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY TWELVE PERCENT. AND THEN JUST AN ANNUAL DENTAL VISIT FOR NY TYPE OF THE DEVIL SERVICE FOR ADULTS IS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE PERCENT. BUT THAT DATA IS LIKELY TO CHANGE AS WE CONTINUE TO GET CLAIMS RUN OUT FOR OUR PROGRAM. THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF OUR CONCERNS IN TERMS UP WRITER PARTICIPATION IN OUR PROGRAM. AND AS OF MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND OUR FEE FOR SERVICE GENERAL PROGRAM WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY SIX HUNDRED SERVICE OFFICE LOCATIONS. AND APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNT NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX RENDERING PROVIDERS I'M IN OUR PROGRAM IN THIS IS INCLUSIVE OF PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING AND BOTH ARE DIEM SEE. AN OUR FEE FOR SERVICE DENTICLE PROGRAM AND LIKE I SAID EARLIER WHILE WE HAVE MADE SOME GAINS IN OUR PROGRAM WE DO RECOGNIZE. THAT THERE IS STILL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE INVESTMENT SEDATE HELP TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS. THAT WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN INCLUDING LEGISLATIVE ACTION. IN TERMS OF PROP FIFTY SIX THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT. THAT SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE AYE SUBJECT TO THOSE PAYMENTS SO WE ARE REVIEWING UP PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME INTO THE DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL. PROCEDURE BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THOSE PAVEMENTS I'M AND WE'RE LOOKING AT. ADDRESSING THOSE AND COMING BACK WITH MAY REVISE IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE USE OF PROP FIFTY SIX. I'M THAT STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS INCLUDE LOOKING AT THE INCLUSION OF ADULT PART I PREVENTIVE SERVICES. PERIODONTAL SERVICES EXTENDED APPOINTMENT TIMES AND THEN GENERAL ANESTHESIA PARITY. AND THEN WE'LL LOOK AT THOSE I'M FOR ANY OTHER PROPOSALS THAT ARE ALSO PRESENT ON TODAY FOR CONSIDERATION. AND THEN AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT. AS WE'RE FOCUSING ON THOSE SERVICES THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE PROP FIFTIES PAYMENTS. LOOKING AT AREAS WHERE THERE IS UNDER UTILIZATION AND THEM FOCUSING THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT THEY'LL BE THE GREATEST BENEFIT. OUT FOR OUR COVERED BENEFICIARIES. THINK THE SMALL OFTEN. DR KUMAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JACK MARIN STAYED DOWN DIRECTOR. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE ORAL HEALTH PROGRAM THE.

THANK YOU BIGGER DOCTOR KAMARCK. CLEAR GLASS WATER. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELLIOTT. TO YOU KNOW COMMENT. WE HAVE A KATIE ANDREW WAS WELL AS BRIANNA PITMAN AND KIMBERLY CHAN CAN WE CREATE A LITTLE BUT A SPACE FOR THEM UP. HERE I. CALF NOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF PRE INDEPENDENCE FUNDS ARE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION. I WANTED JUST SAM KEEP MY COMMENTS DIRECTLY TO THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX. DONE THE COUNCILMEN ALL PAYMENTS. I MEAN SPECIFICALLY OUT FOR THAT AND THE NEW MONEY THAT HAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE SEVENTY MILLION. I'M WE REALLY THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON PREVENTION AND PERIODONTAL CARROTS ARE GOING TREATMENT CARE I'M AS RENEE MENTIONED EARLIER. I'M WE HAVE GIVEN THAT PROPOSAL TO THE DEPARTMENT BUT WOULD URGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE. TO PUSH THE. DEPARTMENT REALLY FOCUS ON THOSE TWO TWO PLACES I'M THINK THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL LONG TERM SAVINGS COSTS FOR THE STATE BOTH ON THE PREVENTION AND THE PERIODONTAL CARE SIDE. BUT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY DOUBLE DISEASES VERY MUCH PREVENT PREVENTABLE AND WE DO HAVE THE DTI FOCUSING ON CHILDREN ZERO TO TWENTY. THERE THERE IS NOTHING FOR ADULTS AND WE KNOW THAT THE DTI IS GOING AWAY AND SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT TO SORT OF LONG TERM LUCK. HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN SOME KIND OF INCENTIVE? FOR PREVENTION FOR CHILDREN A MINUTE ESPECIALLY FOR THE PERIODONTAL CARE I WAS THE ONE AREA I'M OF THE ADULT DENTAL BENEFITS THAT WERE RESTORED. THIS YEAR WHICH WERE VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT DID NOT RECEIVE A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT IN THERE'S A LOT OF BACKLOG I'M AND IN NEED. OF FOR ADULTS AND SO THAT'S REALLY AN AREA WHERE THERE'S A LOT IN NEED I AM AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE CHRONIC DISEASE. AND AND THEN I WOULD ALSO AND JUST MAKE A COMMENT AROUND STABILITY AND CONTINUITY INTO CAL IS A PROBLEM AS PROGRAM THE TIDE I'M A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND IT'S BEEN UNDER FUNDED YOU HEARD A LITTLE. BIT OF THE HISTORY THERE I'M THE DTI AND THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON OUT REACHED OUR MEMBERS TO GET THEM INVOLVED. BUT I THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE AWHILE TO UNDO THE DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN DONE TO THE PROGRAM FRANKLY AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME TIME AND THE ABILITY TO EVALUATE THAT AND. I KNOW WE TALKED LAST MONTH THE BEGINNING IN MARCH FIFTH ABOUT. THE CONTINUITY OF THOSE PAYMENTS OUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT WHICH IS YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING A START STOP. FOR THOSE THOSE PAYMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO PROVIDERS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY GONNA DISINCENTIVE EYES THEM TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE PRACTICE WHICH IS REALLY WHAT WE WANT TO SEE. I THINK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KIMBERLY CHEN ON PATH CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK. THEY WANT IT ECHO A SOME OF THE COMMENTS. THAT I'M STATEMENT. SPENCER NOTED. A PARTICULARLY ON THE NEED FOR PREVENTIVE SERVICES. MISSY PEN IS THE CONVENER OF THE STATE ORAL HEALTH NETWORK AND AS PART OF THAT WE CONDUCTED A LISTENING TOUR ACROSS THE. STATE ON. HEALTH THINGS WERE GOING NOW THAT WE HAVE A RESTORED ADULT DENTAL BENEFITS AND PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX AND. AS ONE PARTICIPANT NOTED WE NEED FROM THE STATE A BUSINESS MODEL FOR PREVENTION SERVICES BECAUSE FOR PAID FOR PATIENTS ACCESS TO PREVENTION IS HOW WE WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND. HELP TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES I WANT TO SHARE A PARTICULAR STORY. FROM FRESNO WE LEARNED THAT. THERE WAS IN FACT AN UPTICK IN UTILIZATION AND ACCESS FROM ENROLLEES AND WE ASK WHY HOW IT WAS HAPPENING WE LEARNED THAT CAN THE COUNTY WAS ACTUALLY HIRING. SALES PEOPLE TO WORK ON OUT REACHED A WORKING WITH. UP PROVIDERS ONE ON ONE SHOWING THEM THE BUSINESS CASE FOR. TAKING A JOB AT THE DEAD COW PATIENTS NOW WITH THE PROVIDER UP PAYMENTS FROM PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX AND WE WOULD ARGUE THAT WE WOULD NEED MORE OF THIS AND TO PROVIDE THAT STABILITY SHOWING THAT. PREVENTION IS GOING TO BE PART OF THAT COVERED. BENEFITS AS WELL. THAT RECEIVE THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. AT MOVING FORWARD WE LOVE TO ALSO SEE. THAT GREATER TRANSPARENCY. AND. DISCUSSION OF EVALUATION. WE WANT TO KNOW WHETHER THIS IS ACTUALLY INCREASE INCREASING UTILIZATION WE HAVE GREAT ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE BUT UP TO DATE WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY MOVING FORWARD. ON HOW WILL ADDITIONAL CODES BE. SELECTED A WHAT WILL BE THE PROCESS. IN SHARING WITH STAKEHOLDERS FOR THAT. DO WE HAVE A TIME LINE FOR THESE THINGS MOVING FOR AND IN TERMS OF REALIZATION AS STRUCTURE YOU KNOW. NO UNDERSTANDING THE DEMOGRAPHIC UP BREAKDOWN OF UTILIZATION. I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE AND. WOULD LOVE TO SEE THOSE ADJUSTMENT FORK. IF YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR. COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF AKB ANDREW CHILDREN NOW I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM CPA AND SEE PAN. IN THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND EVALUATION THE PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. WE ALSO STRONGLY AGREE WITH THE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE PREVENTION. AND PERIODONTAL SERVICES. AND WE HAVE CONCERNS AROUND THE SUSTAINABILITY OF INCENTIVES FOR PREVENTIVE STARTED SERVICES I'VE FOR BENEFICIARIES AGES ZERO TO TWENTY ONCE THE DTI CONCLUDES IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND SO WE ASK THAT YOU SEE US CONSIDER USING PROPERTY SIX A PEROT PAYMENT FUNDS TO CONTINUE PRIORITIZING PREVENTIVE DENTAL SERVICES FOR CHILDREN. AS WELL AS CONSIDER THE ADDITION OF CODE DE EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY YEAR. WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE REMOVAL OF ORTHODONTIC APPLIANCES CONSTRUCTION RETAINER PLACEMENT FOR THOSE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH THAT HAVE INCOMPLETE BUT APPROVED TREATMENT AND AUTHORIZATIONS THEY HAVE AGED OUT OF THE FOSTER YOUTH SYSTEM. LASTLY I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS. AB TWENTY TWO OF SEVEN A PET. THAT WHICH WE KNOW AIMS TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY IMPROVE DENTAL CARE CORONATION WITHIN THE DON'T HELP PROGRAM. OF IN PART BY CALLING FOR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE HEALTH PLANS TO REQUIRE THEIR PROVIDER NETWORKS TO PROVIDE DENTAL SCREENINGS REFERRED TO DENT CAL PROVIDERS AND PROVIDE DENTAL RELATED. CARE COORDINATION IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT AT THIS POINT THERE'S NO MEASURE TO TRACK ADHERENCE TO THAT AND SO WE WANTED TO. USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIFT THAT UP AND URGED THE A CS TWO AND DEVELOP MEASURES SO THAT WE CAN TRACK IT PARENTS TO THOSE PARTICULAR PROVISIONS AND AB TWENTY SEVEN. THINK YOU WE GIVE. DO NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE EIGHT. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF OUR FULL ADULT RESTORATION AND DTI ACCESS REMAINS TO BE A CONCERN AS SEEN. BY RECENT DATA FROM BEACH CS THAT SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF DEAD TO CALPERS FIGHTERS HAVE ACTUALLY DECLINED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. WHEN YOU WOULD EXPECT THE NUMBERS TO INCREASE. IN ADDITION WE'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE A GREATER FOCUS ON PREVENTION FOR ADULTS AND GUN TREATMENT AS IT'S APPALLING THAT TWO OF THE TOP TEN. DEADLY CAO SERVICES FOR ADULTS IS EXTRACTION. ON. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE FIVE COUNTY SOME OF WHICH ARE IN MISTER WOODS DISTRICT. AYE THAT HAVE NO DEAD TO CAL WHATSOEVER AND SO TENER. A SOAP BADEN SUBLIMINAL RATES COULD COULD BE DIRECTED THERE AS WELL. AND AND LASTLY IN REGARDS JACK AB TWO TWO ZERO SEVEN I WILL BE WE APPRECIATE THAT BILL MOVING FORWARD IN LATIN WHICH REQUIRED IT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS TO COORDINATE DENNY CAO BENEFITS FOR THEIR ENROLLEES BY INCLUDING TANNIC. DENTAL SCREENINGS I WE'D LIKE TO SEE HERE ABOUT PROGRESS AS WELL AS HOW I TEACH THE ASSISTANT FORCING THAT THE KEY. IF YOU. MILLION DOLLARS OF HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA AND WE APPRECIATE. THE DIRECTORS. COMMENT ABOUT REVIEWING THE PROPOSALS THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S COTTON AND COMING BACK IN MAY REVISE. WITH SUGGESTIONS AND. AND. FOR INVESTMENT AND HOW TO USE THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS I'M WE HOWEVER. DO REMAIN CONCERNED THAT UTILIZATION AMONGST CHILDREN CONTINUES TO BE LOW WITH LESS THAN HALF OF CHILDREN GETTING PREVENTIVE CARE AND VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF DENTAL PROVIDERS. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR PROVIDER PARTICIPATION AND DENTAL UTILIZATION THE DENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE RESTORATION OF THE DENTAL BENEFIT. AND OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP THAT FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. HEALTH ACCESS ALSO. AS A PART OF THE ORAL HEALTH NETWORK ALONG WITH THE PEN AND WE WANNA. ECHO KIM AYE CHAN'S COMMENTS AS WELL AS LINDA IS. ON PREVENTIVE AND PERIODONTAL TREATMENT. AND I HOPE THAT TO SEE THOSE. DENTAL CODES FUNDED THROUGH SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AS WELL THANK YOU THE COMMAND. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS VIVICA RIGHT NOW ANDERSON I'M WITH PDI SURGERY CENTER RELOCATING IN CINEMA CAO ME WHERE TO UPPER TORRANCE SURGERY CENTER. WHERE CLINICS FROM THIRTY THREE ARE COUNTY SEND THEIR CHILDREN EVERYDAY WE SEE? TAM CHILDREN IN EACH OR I MEAN NOT FIVE MINUTES OR TEMPER DAY AND IT'S USUALLY A THREE AND A HALF YEAR OLD WITH A WOOD AROUND FOURTEEN CAVITIES. WE HEAR A LOT FROM THE FAMILIES THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO FIND IT DOWN TO CAL PROVIDER IN THEIR COUNTY THAT WE'LL SEE A CHILD'S ZERO TWO THREE. AM SO WE DO URGE THAT THE. WE DO URGE THE DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MORE AND RELEASED WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF DENTISTS THAT WE ARE IN CONTACT WITH WHO HAD HADN'T REALLY FIGURED OUT THAT THERE WAS. ENHANCED REIMBURSEMENTS I THINK OUTREACH BUT CONTRACTOR THAT'S DOING OUTREACH TO ENROLLEES CENTER PROVIDERS MORE OF THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT WE ALSO SEE DISABLED PATIENTS ARROGANCE OF A COURSE EVERYONE WHO I AM. HAS LISTEN TODAY THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD BE TREATING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OR ON PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS OR PEOPLE ON MEDICARE ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN% OUR OWN THREE CHILDREN OR OUR OWN CHILDREN I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND I FEEL STRONGLY. THAT THE KIND OF ACCESS THAT I HAVE JUST KID WE HAPPEN TO HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE. THEY'VE HELD MY HAND WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW THAT MILK IN A SIPPY CUP WAS NOT BAD. BUT BAD. WHEN IT'S CONSTANT AT THE SAME THING WITH I'M A LOT OF THE A LOT OF THE FAMILIES THEY GET APPLE JUICE AND THEY THINK APPLE JUICE IS GOOD IT'S IN THE WEEK PACKET. BUT THEY PUT IT IN THE SIPPY CUP AND THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THAT REALLY HARMS THEM SO I THINK IT'S EASY TO SAY THEY'RE DOING IT WRONG BUT WE ARE NOT AS THE STATE. SUPPORTING FAMILIES ON MEDI CAL OR DOWN TO COUNT IN THE SAME WAY THAT WERE SUPPORTING OF FAMILIES ON ON A TO PRIVATE INSURANCE WE'VE SEEN IT IN DIFFERENT THAT I PREVIOUS YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF THAT THEM. THE TESTIMONY TODAY I THINK IT'S JUST TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A STAND. THERE'S NOT TWO DIFFERENT STANDARDS DEPENDING ON WHAT INSURANCE YOUR OWN AND THAT ALL FAMILIES AND ALL PATIENTS BETWEEN THE TWO THAT THE QUALITY OF CARE BECAUSE. EVERYONE MATTERS SO I'M THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK. IT COULD BE REPRESENTING WESTERN DENTAL. THE STATE'S LARGEST PROVIDER OF. SERVICES TO DONNA CALAVERA MILLION VISITS THIS YEAR. BOB WE JUST WANT TO SAY WERE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF MOVING THE PROGRAM FURTHER ALONG. USING THE PROPOSALS THAT CDA AND SEE PAN AND ITS ALLIES ABROAD LONG WE THINK. DARIO AND. AND PREVENTIVE CARE ARE IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS IN A PROGRAM THAT IS GETTING BETTER. THERE IS AN UP TICK IN PROVIDERS OF THIS YEAR OVER LAST YEAR OF ALMOST A THOUSAND AND. IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE CATEGORY SOMETHING IS HAPPENING THAT'S BETTER NEEDS TO HAPPEN. FASTER AND NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH GREATER VOLUME BUT. WE'RE ON THE WAY AND I ALSO WANT TO. GIVE HAVE TIPPED TO THE DEPARTMENT SHATTUCK IS ALSO MUCH BETTER. POLICY AND BUSINESS PARTNER FOR PROVIDERS THEN IT MAY HAVE BEEN FOUR YEARS AGO LOT MORE DIRECT. A LOT MORE COLLABORATIVE LOT MORE INCLUSIVE IT'S BETTER THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. CLEVELAND REPRESENTING WRITTEN CARRY ME OF PEDIATRICS OUGHT WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF CHILDREN'S NOW. A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE FLUORIDE VARNISH ON IN TWENTY FIFTEEN A A. P. RECOMMENDED ON. MAY THE ONLY RECOMMENDATION THAT YEAR WAS FOR CHILDREN TO HAVE ACCESS TO OUR OF FLUORIDE VARNISH. SO WE ON SUPPORT. THEY CAN. GOOD AFTERNOON ARE SIMEON GANTA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA BLACK HEALTH NETWORK AND WE ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF SEE PAN AND ITS PARTNERS RECOMMENDATION. TO PROVIDE DENTAL CODES FUNDED THROUGH SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE EIGHT HELP BRING UP TO THE DYESS. AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH DOCTOR WOULD BUT I MAY HAVE THE DEPARTMENT COME BACK IN FRONT IF I MAY. LA EL ENDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND DOCTOR WOULD WHEN YOU'RE READY. YEAH I'D JUST LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF OF THE PROPOSAL'S WE HEARD. FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS OF RELATED PREVENTION AND PERIODONTAL TREATMENT. IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO BEND THE COST CURVE ON ON ISSUES WE'VE GOT TO FOCUS ON PREVENTION. AND. AND THEN PERIODONTAL TREATMENT. OBVIOUSLY SYMPTOM OF OTHER CONDITIONS AS WELL AND. CHALLENGES THAT DIABETICS FACE. BUT ALSO. OTHER HEALTH CONDITIONS AS WELL AND SO. I MEAN COURAGE TO HEAR FROM SOME THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS COMING OUT. IN AND PARTICIPATE IN A MEAN COURAGE TO HEAR THAT THERE IS. IMPROVEMENT IN THE WITH THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT. BUT BUT I I I JUST YOU KNOW. WITH MAYBE WERE INCHING UP ABOVE BUT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT WE'VE REALLY TURNED THAT CORNER THERE AND. AND FUNDAMENTALLY STILL THE THERE REALLY. HIGH CASA DELIVERING CARE. TO PEOPLE IN THIS PROFESSION MAKE THE DATA CAL RATES THAT ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE FIND A WAY TO STICK CONTINUE TO SUPPLEMENT THOSE ARE INCREASES BECAUSE. IT'S SIMPLY NOT FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE FOR MOST PEOPLE AND PRIVATE PRACTICE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES. I COULD GO INTO THE STORIES OF MY OWN PRACTICE WE'VE HEARD HIM HER MOM BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN ONLY DO. YOU CAN ONLY PROVIDE CARE AT A LOSS FOR SO LONG BEFORE YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO PRIDE CARE. SO. SO. IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD BUT I AM ENCOURAGED AND WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THE FOCUS ON ON THE CODES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR IT. PREVENTION. AND AND APPEARED ON THE TREATMENT. THINKING. I WANTED TO ECHO MANY OF THE SAME COMMENTS. BOTH PROVIDER PARTICIPATION AND UTILIZATION OUR FITNESS NECESSARY FOR US TO ACTUALLY PREVENT DISEASE. I'M I'M A BIT STRUCK LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT TWENTY ONE PERCENT OF ADULTS UTILIZED CARE EACH AND EVERY YEAR THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AND. HAVE CONCERNS THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WE ARE NOT THERE YET IS OUR RATES. AND SO JUST WOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT TO REALLY WILL WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND ADVOCATES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION BEFORE US AT THE ME REPURPOSE. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE EIGHT OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NOT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BURR'S MY NAME IS MICHELLE GIVENS AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY EXECUTIVE HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO REQUEST AND. ROLL OVER ABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ROLL OVER LOCAL ORAL HEALTH PROGRAM FUNDING FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT. AND AS DOCTOR KUMAR STATED THERE'S I HAVE ROUGHLY EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLAR THAT'S BEEN SET ASIDE FOR GRANTS TO LOCAL ORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO CREATE AND EXPAND TO CUT THE CAPACITY AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO CONDUCT. OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AND LINKAGES TO ADD DENTAL PROVIDERS THE GRANTS ARE PROVIDED FOR A FIVE YEAR PERIOD WITH FUNDING SPREAD EVENLY. OVER THE COURSE OF EACH YEAR AND ACCORDING TO GUIDELINES THAT WERE RELEASED BY THE LOCAL ORAL HEALTH PROGRAM FUNDING CANNOT BE ROLLED OVER FROM YEAR TO YEAR. HOWEVER WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND HAVING ONLY SIX MONTHS FOR EXAMPLE TO EXPAND A FULL YEAR IS WORTH ABOUT HOW OUT. FUNDING ALLOCATION IN THE FIRST YEAR AND WE FIND OURSELVES CHALLENGE TO REALLY EXPAND THE GRANT FUNDS IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AND WE STAND TO LOSE ACCESS TO CREATE CRITICAL RESOURCES THEY CAN GO BACK INTO THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE. AND UTILIZING THE PROGRAM AT ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE EARLIER YEARS OF THE PROGRAM ARE REALLY CARED AT AND CAN'T BUILDING THE STAFFING CAPACITY THE INTERNAL CAPACITY IN DOING THINGS SUCH AS ASSESSMENT SEN. ON COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND SO FORTH AND BUILDING WHAT AND A COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN WOULD LOOK LIKE THE LATTER YEARS FOCUS MORE ON INVESTMENTS OF STRATEGIES AT PROMOTING EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES CONDUCTING OUR REGION IMPLEMENTATION. AND HEALTH AND EDUCATION LITERALIST LITERACY CAMPAIGNS AND. I WOULD ALSO JUST MENTION THE ABSENT THE ABILITY TO ROLE OVER THE FUNDING IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT AND USE FUNDING WOULD GO BACK AND AND BE USED FOR THE INTENT OF FURTHERING THE PROPOSITION BUT IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE FUNDING WE GO BACK TO THE LOCAL ORAL. HEALTH PROGRAM NOR DOES IT GUARANTEE THAT WE GO BACK TO THE PARTICULAR JURISDICTION THAT WOULD HAVE LOST THE FUNDING. AND SO I REQUEST TODAY AND IS MODELED AFTER OTHER PRACTICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY HAPPENING FOR EXAMPLE IN THE TOBACCO PROGRAM WHERE IT ALLOWS THE ABILITY TO ROLL OVER FUNDING FOR UP TO THREE YEARS AND MOVING FORWARD. AND AGAIN WE ARE JUST REALLY TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THAT THE FUNDS ARE USED PURELY FOR THE ENTIRE AND THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WERE ABLE TO MAKE GREAT DECISIONS AND THAT. THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IS GOING TO BE SUSTAINABLE. I THINK YOU WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE NINE. KIMBERLY CHEN OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK WHERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. STEVEN IS ONE OF THE IS THE COMPUTER FOR THE STATE ORAL HEALTH NETWORK. IN OUR WORK TALKING TO FOLKS AROUND THE STATE ON FOLKS ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS WORK TO. TO FINALLY DEVELOP ALL OF ORAL HEALTH PLAN FOR COUNTIES AND IT WOULD BE A SHAME FOR ON THE WORK TO BE DISRUPTED ON. THAT IF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS PROPOSAL BEING ADOPTED SO WE ORDER SUPPORT. THANK YOU MA'AM. I BRING UP INSTANCE OVER THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL I WE WERE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS SUPPORTERS OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX AND WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS I'M MONEY GOING TO. DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH FOR ORAL HEALTH NEEDS REALLY DO SEE THIS AS SORT OF A GAME CHANGER ALL OVER THE STATE TO IMPROVE I'M ORAL HEALTH. NOT JUST IN THE DENTAL PROGRAM BUT FOR EVERYBODY VERY CONCERNED THAT THE MONEY MAYBE I'M YOU KNOW I'M NOT BE FLOWING THE WAY WE'D LIKE IT TO AND THAT WE KNOW WE'RE HEARING FROM. SOME LOCAL FOLKS THAT THEY'RE HAVING ISSUES GETTING THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR AND ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT IT MIGHT BE DIVERTED TO SOME OTHER PURPOSE WHEN IT WAS CLEARLY THE INTENT OF THE VOTERS THAT. THIS MONEY I'M GO TO ORAL HEALTH THANK YOU BECAME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS VERENIGDE TING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU MA'AM. WENT AWAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

NEVER COME RIGHT OUT ANDERSONOF PTI SURGERIES SUMMER ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSED. HUMAN. SIMEON GANT CALIFORNIA BLACK HEALTH NETWORK IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE NINE OH BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS. I. WILL ADD MY OWN TO START THEN. I AGREED WITH THE COMMENT ABOUT VOTER INTENT IT WAS THE INTENT FOR US TO SEND THIS MONEY DOWN TO THE COUNTIES AND FOR THEM TO SPEND IT RESPONSIBLY. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR PROPOSAL IS MODELED AFTER WHAT WE DO WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND I'M QUITE SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU PRESENTED HERE TODAY. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE NINE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TEN A LOT ISSUE I'M COMMENTING ON A DESTRUCTIVE THERE. SO DOES THE PROPOSAL FROM AS CDA TO. PUT SALUTE I MEAN FLUORIDE AS A MEDICAL COVERED BENEFIT. STF IS A TOPICAL AYE MEDICAMENT THAT YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY PAINT ONTO TEETH IN A HOUSE THAT. CAN SLOW OR STOP ON THE GROWTH OF CAVITY SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY A GAME CHANGER IN THE FIELD OF DENTISTRY. IT IS CURRENTLY BEING USED BY THE DEPARTMENT IN THE DOMAIN TO PILOT DTI. DOESN'T ELEVEN COUNTIES FOR KIDS UNDER SIX AND ONLY SOME OF THOSE KIDS HAVE THE HIGHEST NEED. SO WE USE FEEL LIKE THAT IT IS M. IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL THE DATA CAL BENEFICIARIES. NOT JUST THOSE IN THOSE ELEVEN COUNTIES AND WE KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING EVALUATING THAT S. I'M BUT THERE'S A LOT OF DATA THAT'S ALREADY OUT OF THE OUT THERE. THE LAST TWO CD INTERNALS IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY LOOKED AT THIS THEIR SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN DONE AND WE KNOW THAT IT WORKS AND SO WE THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE AN OPTION I'M FOR THE PROVIDERS AND AND CAL JUST BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A. NEW OPPORTUNITY AND CAN REALLY. THINGS ON A COST SAVINGS FOR YOU KNOW USING THIS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO TREATMENT ESPECIALLY ON VERY YOUNG KIDS AND YOU KNOW THOSE WHO ARE. ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE IN CANTON YOU KNOW HOLD THEIR MOUTH OPEN LONG AFTER STEVE TRADITIONAL TREATMENT. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TEN. KITTY ANDREW CHILDREN OUT IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU THANK HIM. BRENT SPENCE WITH THE WEST HEALTH INSTITUTE IN SUPPORT. PERFECT RIGHT NOW ANDERSON OF PTS ORDER SOME ALSO SUPPORT ACHE GUMP JUST WITH THE CAB CARRY UP KIND OF HOW I'M FAMILIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SURPRISED WHEN THEY GET THE SILVER CAPS. WHAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN FROM CUT CLINICS THAT HAVE SENT US THE KIDS WITH FLORA IS THAT THE PARENTS DON'T KNOW THAT? I'M GONNA GET BLACKENED FROM THE SILVER IS I THINK IT'S JUST. AGAIN OVERALL BUT WE JUST EDUCATE THE FAMILIES THAT. YOUR. IF YOU DON'T BRUSH IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T COME IN EARLIER IF WE'RE NOT GIVING YOU MORE THAT DENTISTS TO GO TO ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM BUT ALSO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW THERE'S DISCOLORATION FROM THE SILVER AND YES THE SILVER CAPS IS IS THE OTHER OPTION WAS GONE FAR LONG SO I JUST. I THINK THAT WE CAN'T DO ENOUGH I'M ASKING FOR A PR CAMPAIGN PUBLIC AWARENESS OF HOW BIG A PROBLEM THAT THE CASE SO THANKS. I COMMEND. WITH THAT WILL BRING IT BACK UP THE DYESS DOCTOR WOULD. YEAH JUST LIKE THE SAP FIRST OF. SAW THIS SERVE AT AT NYU COUPLE YEARS AGO I'M OF TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO AND. THERE'S NO QUESTION THE VALUE OF THIS. AND THE POTENTIAL. FOR SAVING THE. A LOT A LOT OF. A LOT OF A LOT OF DOLLARS AT THE END OF THE LINE. THERE AT THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT IT DOES MAKE THE CHIEF LOOK BLACK. IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THERE IS TO QUE BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IT A REST THE DECAY AND AND THOSE IN IN SOME THOSE CASES AND SOME OF THESE POPULATIONS IS JUST SO HARD TO GET THEM. INTO TREATMENT THAT IT WOULD BE A HUGE PUBLIC SERVICE. TO DO. TO TO HAVE THIS AS A AS A COVERED BENEFIT SO I COULDN'T ENCOURAGE US ONE ENOUGH QUITE FRANKLY. WELL WITH THAT. WE LOOK TO YOU DOCTOR WOULD FOR ADVICE REGARDING DENTAL ISSUES AND APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT HERE TODAY. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE ELEVEN THANK YOU. MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE I AM BUT DOCTOR PAUL GLASS BUT I'M A PROFESSOR AT UNIVERSITY CIVIC SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY IN SAN FRANCISCO. HAVE AT A FORTY YEAR CAREER WORKING PRIMARILY IT WITH A FOCUS ON PEOPLE WITH. SPECIAL WORD NOW REFER TO SPECIAL DENTAL CARE NEEDS AS A PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC MEDICAL MENTAL BEHAVIOR OR DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO RECEIVE DENTAL CARE OFTEN IN A NORMAL MANNER. I STARTED MY CAREER WORKING IN A VERY CLICK AWAY IN A HOSPITAL I DIRECTED HOSPITAL JOURNAL PRACTICE RESIDENCY PROGRAM. I SAW MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE ADMITTED TO THE OPERATING ROOM I WAS THERE PROVIDING DENTAL TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD. YEARS OF NEGLECT. ENDED UP IN A SITUATION WHERE WE WERE SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY TO REPAIR THINGS THAT HADN'T BEEN ADRESSED FOR A LONG TIME. I SAW PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL WHO DIED. OF DEADLINE FACTIONS OFTEN THE DEATH CERTIFICATE DIDN'T SAY DEADLINE FACTION AT SAID DUH. OF DISSEMINATED SEPSIS OR ITS EDNA ARE CARDIAC ARREST OR BRAIN ABSCESS BUT I KNEW THAT THEY WERE DYING FROM DOUBLE DISEASE. I'M SINCE THAT TIME MY CAREER TAKEN A SHIFT AND I NOW. DIRECTOR OF POLICY ADVOCACY CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY PACIFIC'S WITH DENTISTRY IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT VARIOUS WAYS OF TRYING TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO PEOPLE. IN POPULATIONS HAVE TROUBLE GETTING DENTAL CARE IN THE NORMAL DENTAL CARE SYSTEM. FROM AMONG THEM AS WE WORKED ON. SOMETHING CALLED A VIRTUAL DEL HOME SYSTEM WHICH USES TELEHEALTH CONNECTED TEAMS TO GET ALLIED THEM PERSONNEL INTO COMMUNITIES AND HAVE THEM CONNECTED BY A TELEHEALTH SYSTEM INTO DENTISTS. IF I HAD A OF A SLIDE SHOW HERE THE SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF A YOUNG MAN WHO'S IN A. RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY IN SAN MATEO WHO HAD HAD ALL OF HIS PREVIOUS DENTAL CARE DONE IN A HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM. HE WOULD WALK INTO DENTAL OFFICE HE'D BE NERVOUS TO DENNIS WOULD LOOK AT AMOUNTS I CAN'T WORK ON THIS PERSON NEEDS TO BE UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA. AND YET IN HIS OWN HOME WITH A DENTAL HYGIENIST USE IT WILL TAKE COMPLETE RECORDS CLEANEST TEETH BUMP DO SMALL FILLINGS THAT ARE ALLOWED NOW USE THINGS LIKE SOBRE DIE MEAN FOR IT HE MAY NEVER HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL AGAIN. AND YET HIS HISTORY HAS BEEN SPENDING HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY IN A HOSTILE SITUATION FOR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO AT A FRACTION OF THE COST. NOW. THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE IDENTICAL SYSTEM THAT ISN'T ORGANIZED TO SUPPORT THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY ADELA CALLOUS PRIMARILY A PIECEWORK SYSTEM IT PAYS FOR THE FILLING. AND IS WILLING NO DIFFERENTIATION IN TERMS OF THE OF THE PERSON WHO NEEDS THAT FEELING. THAT PEOPLE WHO WHO COULD ACTUALLY RECEIVE DEL CARE WITH A LECTURE TIME SITTING IN THE CHAIR DOING THINGS MORE SLOWLY THERE'S NO EXTRA REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT. SOMEONE WHO TAKES A FOUR FIVE CALLS TO THEIR PHYSICIANS TO WORK OUT THE MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS OR WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH CONSENT ISSUES THAT ARE PRESENT IN NORMAL PEOPLE THERE'S NO. BUT EXTRA COMPENSATION FOR ANY OF THOSE KIND OF ACTIVITIES SORES RESULT. AS YOU ALL KNOW IN THE SYSTEM WHERE MANY PROVIDERS WHERE HER ACCEPTING GONNA CALCULATOR DOES BARELY GETTING BY. TO TAKEN AT A PERSON WHO'S GONNA TAKE TWICE OR THREE TIMES A FOUR TIMES AS MANY HOURS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE TREATMENT FOR THEM. IT BECOMES COMPLETELY UNDOABLE SO THIS PROPOSALBEFORE IS TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE INDIVIDUALS IN THESE CONDITIONS THAT DO TAKE EXTRA TIME TO PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT. FOR THEM I THINK THAT TOUGH THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOME YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO QUANTIFY ALL THE SAVINGS IN THIS BECAUSE SOME OF THEM ARE AND. ARE IN OTHER KINDS OF BUCKETS AS YOU ALL KNOW THE WAY WE WE DO OUR ACCOUNTING IN THE WORLD. UP BUT YET I THINK THAT WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR NOT ONLY. SAVING A LOT OF MONEY BY PROVIDING EARLY AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE IF YOU COULD PROVIDE. THE UP PROVIDERS A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA REIMBURSEMENT TO TAKE THE EXTRA TIME TO BE ABLE TO SEE THESE POPULATIONS. I THINK THIS PROPOSES A VERY WISE USE OF PUBLIC MONEY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR. WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ELEVEN. BRENT SPENCER WITH THE WEST HEALTH INSTITUTE ACTUALLY THE SPONSORS OF THIS POLLS BEFORE YOU. WE PREDICTED RATIONS IMPORTANT A PROPOSAL TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN NEED AS DESCRIBED DOT LASSEN THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. WENT AWAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE'VE HEARD OF ACCESS ISSUES FOR THIS POPULATION SO DO SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I BREATHE HIM INSTANCE ARE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT AND WE DO HAVE SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT WE FACE WITH THAT AND. SPONSORS AROUND ENSURING THAT WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO CUT OFF ON THE OTHER SOURCES OF CARE AND IN SOME INSTANCES WHERE AS WE'VE HEARD THAT. UNLIKE THE REGIONAL CENTERS WILL SORT OF BACK FILL AND FOR THESE I AM CASE MANAGEMENT AND BEHAVIORAL MANAGEMENT CODES AND JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IN THE PROCESS OF. PUTTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN FOR THESE SERVICES WHICH WE DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND AND AND ACKNOWLEDGE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE NOT. YOU KNOW CREATING NEW PROBLEMS. I COMMEND. MEDICARE RIGHT NOW ANDERSON ON PBS SURGERIES CENTER OUT UP UNTIL THREE YEARS AGO ITEM WE ONLY TO CARE CHILDREN BUT WE WERE ACTUALLY ASKED BY OF THAT PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PATIENTS UP TO TWENTY FIVE. OF SPECIAL NEEDS ARE AND AS HIGH AS WE COULD GO AND BECAUSE WE'RE AWAY FROM. A HOSPITAL UP TO TWENTY FIVE IS WHAT WE DEEMED SAFE SO FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY PARTNERED. WERENT DIG WITH WITH PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN AND BEEN ABLE TO. SEAT SPECIAL NEEDS PATIENTS TWO MONTHS FOR TWO DAYS OUT OF A MONTH AND ON THOSE DAYS WE CAN ONLY SEE. THREE PATIENTS A FOR PATIENTS RATHER THAN USUAL TAN SO YEAH IT'S IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MEDICAL INTENSITY CHO TAKES LONGER BODIES PATIENTS HAVE NEVER HAD CARE BEFORE. OF WASTE WE WILL ALSO CASE MANAGEMENT THEM AND HELP OUT IF THEY THERE'S SOME BLOOD WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WE ASK THE FAMILIES TO COME IN WITH THE THE VIALS THAT THEY NEED FOR THAT. WE CUT THEIR HAIR PARA THEIR NAILS THINGS LIKE THAT SO I DO HAVE A SUCCESS STORY TO SHARE THIS FROM THIS WEEK WHERE THERE'S NOT A MOM HAS TWO DAUGHTERS THAT HAVE AUTISM. AND THE FIRST TIME THE GIRLS CAME THEY WERE TEN AND TWELVE AND THEY FOUND THEY HAD A LOT OF DECAY JUST FOURTEEN TO ABBOTT EIGHTEEN CAVITIES BOTH OF THEM WE'VE NOW SEEN THEM EVERY YEAR THE LAST THREE YEARS AND THE. BUT WANT ONE OF THE YOUNGEST OF THE TWO GIRLS SHE IS LESS ARM SHE HAS NOT A SEVERE OCT AUTISM AS OF THIS LAST TIME WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA TRY. SINCE YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY CAVITIES AND ALL THIS TIME AND THEY ARE MAINTAINING OUR HER. DENTAL HEALTH BUT THAT SHE'S GOING TO TRY TO GET A X. RACING CLEANINGS GOING FORWARD AT IT UP WITHIN THE PROVIDERS THAT WE CAN'T JUST BEFORE CAN I CATCH IT EARLY ENOUGH THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY IN SUPPORT OF THIS THING. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ELEVEN ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. DOCTOR WHAT. JUST JUST PANIC APPRECIATE SEEING DOCTOR GLASSMAN AGAIN HERE SEEN. FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND. YOU KNOW. CHALLENGING POPULATION. TAKES MORE TIME AND. TO PROVIDE THAT BUT THAT THAT THAT INVESTMENT OF TIME YIELDS HUGE HUGE BENEFITS MUCH MORE THAN WHAT WOULD BE THE THAN THE PROVIDES A BE REMUNERATED AND SO. YES YOU NOT SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF THIS PROPOSAL I THINK IT MAKES. COMPLETE SENSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR GLASSMAN FOR THE PROPOSAL WILL HOLD ISSUE ELEVEN OPEN THANK YOU. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS TRANSMIT HERE ON BEHALF OF THE HEALTH PLAN OF SAN MATEO. HEALTH PLAN OF SAN MATEO WAS A COUNTY ORGANIZE HEALTH SYSTEM THAT'S A MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLAN IT'S A PUBLIC NON PROFIT PLAN I KNOW SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT. MODEL WITH KOS IN THEIR DISTRICTS AND YOU'VE JUST HEARD PARTNERSHIP MEAN MENTION THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THEM. THE MODEL. HEALTH PLANS ABOUT SAN MATEO STRESSES PREVENTIVE CARE AYE KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY THEREBY SAVING MONEY COORDINATING CARE GETTING PEOPLE INTO THAT TYPE OF UP PREVENTIVE CARE. FORTUNATELY IN SAN MATEO THE UTILIZATION RATES FOR DENTAL CARE FOR ELIGIBLE ENROLLEES IS EVEN WORSE THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE. I BELIEVE IT'S FORTY PERCENT OF CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF ADULTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE RECEIVE DENTAL CARE. AND SO ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND SAN MATEO COUNTY THE ORAL HEALTH COALITION WHICH CONSISTS OF PATIENT ADVOCATES AND THE DENTAL COMMUNITY. BEGAN TO GET TOGETHER AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET HIGHER UTILIZATION RATES AND THEY. APPROACHED THE HEALTH PLAN OF SAN MATEO BE AN UNKNOWN ENTITY THAT WAS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THIS TYPE OF A STRUCTURE OF GETTING PEOPLE IN TO RECEIVE HEALTHCARE. AND SO THEY. HAVE COME FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL OF BEFORE YOU TODAY WHICH. IS A PROPOSAL FOR A FIVE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM WHEREBY THE HEALTH PLAN A SAN MATEO WAS THE HEALTH PLAN WOULD. TAKE OVER OR ADD DENTAL. SERVICES AS PART OF THEIR CARE SO JUST LIKE PHARMACY OR MEDICAL OR IMAGE SEEN. DENTAL CARE WOULD BE PART OF IT AND THEN THEY WOULD AS THE HEALTHPLAN WHEN THEY'RE. A REMINDING THEIR ENROLLEES IT'S TIME FOR YOUR ANNUAL CHECKUP OR YOUR MAMMOGRAM OR YOUR CHOLESTEROL TESTS THEY WOULD NOW BE IN A POSITION TO REMIND PEOPLE IT'S TIME TO. GET. DENTAL EXAM OR A CLEANING. THE WAY WE ENVISION NET AND WE. WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR GUARD GUIDANCE BUT WITH THE WAY WE ENVISIONED IT WOULD BE THAT THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PER PATIENT PER MONTH. CAPITATED RATE THAT THEY WOULD BE AT RISK FOR SUFFOLK COST MORE THAN WHAT THEY ARE RECEIVING. THE HEALTH PLAN WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BALANCE. BUT THROWING THAT INTO A. COORDINATED DELIVERY MODEL WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT IT WILL PROVIDE GREATER UTILIZATION BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THAT. THE HEALTH PLAN COULD ADD EVENTUALLY SAVE MONEY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SEEING A LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO GET A MORE COMPLICATED HEALTH. YOU KNOW. THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO TREAT AND ARE MORE COSTLY AND SO THEY'RE HOPEFUL THAT THROUGH THIS PLAN THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PREVENT SOME OF THOSE. THE PLAN THEY DO ENVISION A REPORTING MECHANISM WHERE THEY CAN STUDY TO SEE IF THERE IS BETTER UTILIZATION AND BETTER OUTCOMES ON ON THE BACK AND. AND BE ABLE TO REPORT THAT TO THE DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO SEE IF THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM IS IT IS A SUCCESS SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SIR. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TWELVE. BREANNA PITTMAN SPENCER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN SUPPORT. COME OVER LOCAL DENTAL SOCIETIES IN SAN MATEO. TWO I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND ARE IN SUPPORT I'M WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE PROPOSAL AND WHILE WE HAVE HAD SOME QUESTIONS AROUND DENTAL MANAGED CARE IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM IN THE PAST. THIS. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE RISK WOULD BE MANAGED LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING NEW AND DIFFERENT TO US AND WE DO LIKE THAT IT'S I'M SERVE A FIVE YEAR CONTAINED PILOT WITH MY VALUATION THAT WE THINK WILL. AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL TEACH US SOMETHING I AM ABOUT WHAT INTEGRATION. CAN LOOK LIKE THE AGREEMENT. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE HAVE NO OFFICIAL POSITION BUT WOULD NOTE THAT THE LEGAL AID OF SAN MATEO DOES SUPPORT THIS. A WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES. I WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE THE UTILIZATION RATE COTTON. TO TO BE THE SAME AS I FOR MANAGE CARROTS AT LEAST TEN PERCENT LOWER THAN IT IS AND THE FEE FOR SERVICE SIDE SO I WOULD WANT TO SEE ROBUST DATA COLLECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. LIVE A CORRIVEAU ANDERSON AGAIN REPS ANY PDF SURGERIES SENATOR ESTES OR IN THIRTY THREE COUNTIES AND WE WE JUST APPLAUD THIS A PILOT PROGRAM I THINK ON THE INTEGRATION IS SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO THERE SO MANY RURAL COUNTIES IN SO MANY. AREAS WERE NOT REACHING AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOME COME INNOVATIONS HOPEFULLY SOME GOOD DATA COMES OUT OF THIS AND WE. HAVE A NEW AND BETTER WAYS TO DO IT SO THANK YOU. HUMAN. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT TO BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS DOCTOR WHAT. BUT OBVIOUSLY SEEN BETTER INTEGRATION WITH MEDICAL DENTAL CARE I THINK IS IS A IS A GOAL THAT A LOT OF US. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE. AND THE. WELL FAILURE OF IN MANY WAYS OF OF A LOT OF WAYS OF THE CURRENT PILOT PROJECT PROJECTS ON DENTAL MANAGED CARE HAVE. HAVE LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRED SO. YEAH AND I. IT'S INTERESTING DE I'M CURIOUS HOW. ARE YOU SEE. OTHER THAN COORDINATING HOW DO YOU PLAN HOW THEY PLAN TO GET PROVIDERS IN INVOLVED BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A SILLY FAIRLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS OR RURAL OR ARE THERE CLIP CLINICS. SO JUST TELLING PEOPLE YOU NEED TO GO TO THE DENTIST IS IS NOT GOING TO BE ADEQUATE. YEAH FAIR FAIR QUESTION DOCTOR WOULD AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS BEEN A YEAR AND A HALF IN THE PLANNING OF THE HEALTH PLANS SAN MATEO WASN'T. READY TO. RUN TO THE LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT A PILOT PROGRAM WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THEIR TO LOCAL. DENTAL SOCIETIES THAT THE MY MID POLL MID PENINSULA AND. SAN MATEO COUNTY DENTAL SOCIETIES AND SO THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH THEM AS PART OF THIS ORAL HEALTH COALITION. FOR A YEAR AND A HALF AND I THINK BASICALLY THE HEALTH PLAN IT SAN MATEO SAID LOOK WE'RE NOT WILLING TO TACKLE THIS UNLESS WE THINK WE CAN GET. BY AND FROM THE LAW PROVIDER COMMUNITY TO. PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM OTHERWISE THEY THEY WOULDN'T BE HERE AND AND AGAIN FAILED TO MENTION YOU'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT PART OF THAT WAS BY AND FROM THE PATIENT ADVOCACY COMMUNITY SO THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE A. THE PEOPLE RECEIVING THE CARE WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THIS BUT ALSO TO YOUR POINT THAT THERE WOULD BE BY OFF FROM THE PROVIDERS WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE. THEY SEEMED TO THINK THEY HAVE THE CRITICAL MASS TO TO GET IT GOING BASED ON THAT SUPPORT IN THE. SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION SO. YOU KNOW OUR OUR CLIENTS A LITTLE NERVOUS ESPECIALLY ASSUMING SOME OF THE FINANCIAL RISK THAT OF THEM THEY THEY PARTICIPATE IN THESE THINGS IN THE PAST WHERE THEY'VE ASSUMED THE REST OF IT TO HOPEFULLY GET SOME REWARD AND BE A LITTLE BIT OF A TRAIL BLAZER AND SO. THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. OR NOTHING LIKE A LITTLE SKIN IN THE GAME TO HAVE A LITTLE INCENTIVE RIGHT. SO SO BUT BUT. IT I'M I'M I I LIKE I LIKE THE APPROACH I THINK IT MAKE I THINK I THINK WHICH AGAIN MAKES SENSE WITH THEIR PROPOSALS MAKE SENSE. CLEARLY HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET GET PEOPLE THE CARE THEY NEED AND THAT THE OTHER PILOTS HAPPENED BEEN A SUCCESSFUL QUITE FRANKLY. SO. THE DATA WILL BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THOUGH. AT A FORD A PATTERN THIS AFTER IF IT THE FUTURE FOR OTHER THE OTHER COUNTY A. OPERATE HEALTH SYSTEMS. WE'VE GOT TO KNOW THAT WE'RE BEING SUCCESSFUL AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE ARE SOME DATA CHECK IN POINTS ALONG THE WAY. THAT WE'RE NOT WAITING FIVE YEARS FOR THEM FOR THE ULTIMATE DATA BECAUSE OF THAT WE NEED TO KNOW WE'RE GONNA NEED TO KNOW SOONER RATHER THAN LATER THAT THEY WERE THAT THAT WE'RE HAVING THOUGH SUCCESS METRICS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. YEAH I'M THE PROPOSAL. LANGUAGE WHEN WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD IS REALLY KIND OF OPEN ENDED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT WITH SOME OF THAT BUT IT IS TRUE THAT OUR INTENTION TO HAVE SOME. DATA CHECK IN POINTS. WILL NEED A LITTLE TIME THAT TO BUILD A NETWORK. AND TO GET IT UP AND GOING AND AND HOPEFULLY GROW IT BUT YEAH I MEAN THAT THE DATA IS IMPORTANT AND YOU'VE HEARD AGAIN. PARTNERSHIPS DOING SOME UNIQUE THINGS ARE SOME THINGS AND CAL OPTIMUM ORANGE COUNTY THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO SO BUT ALL THIS IS CONTINGENT ON. HAVING SOME SORT OF A MODEL THAT THAT SHOW SOME SUCCESS BEFORE EVERYONE CAN CUT A DIVAN SO. THANK YOU. I'M ENCOURAGED BY THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE US BUT WOULD HOPE THAT BOTH THE DEPARTMENT AND YOURSELF TO WORK WITH OUR SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE. APPROPRIATE METRICS BEFORE US AS WE GO FORWARD. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TWELVE OPEN INLAND ISSUE THIRTEEN. GOOD EVENING. YOU CARE MEMBERS PLEASURE TO BE HERE. OF THIS BILL BARNABY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION PROVIDES NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION TO PEOPLE'S MEDICAL NEEDS JUSTIFIED I'M HERE TODAY TO INTRODUCE MISTER STEVE HORN WHO'S THE PRESIDENT OF C. EMPTY A. AND HE WILL DESCRIBE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE KIND OF A RECURRING THEME PROVIDERS WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE. BUT IT'S NOT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE UNDER THE CURRENT THE SITUATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR PUBLISHED CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU. BUT I'M STEVE HORN PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION. FROM BEHALF OF THE CMT IN THE PATIENTS WE SERVE MORE RESPECTFULLY ASKING YOU UP FOR RESTORATION OF THE A. B. DOT NINETY SEVEN A TEN PERCENT CUTS. WE HAVE NOT BEEN RESTORED A. MADE WHOLE IF YOU WILL SINCE. TWENTY ELEVEN. NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION WE TRANSPORT THE CHRONICALLY ILL OF THE MOBILITY IMPAIRED THE ALLERGY ELDERLY AND WHEELCHAIR BOUND PATIENTS TO AND FROM THEIR MEDICAL SERVICES. MOST OF OUR TRANSPORTS ARE DIALYSIS PATIENTS. AND THEY GO THREE TIMES A WEEK FIFTY TWO WEEKS OUT OF THE YEAR. AND ACCESS TO CARE ISSUE IS GROWING OF FOR THE MEDICAL FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENTS. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS. ITS DUAL LED DO SOLELY TO THE LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATE AND WE'RE FINDING IT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE METROPOLITAN AREAS IN YOUR MAJOR METROPOLITAN HUBS IT'S THERE'S PLENTY OF PROVIDERS THERE'S PLENTY OF ACCESS. BUT WHEN YOU START GETTING OUT A LITTLE BIT AND THEN OF COURSE YOU RURAL AREAS. IF A PROVIDER HAS TO DRIVE MORE THAN TEN MILES TO GO PICK UP A PATIENT. BECAUSE IN OUR INDUSTRY YOU GET PAID WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY ON PORT. THEY ARE SPENDING MONEY OUT OF THEIR POCKET TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE AND I BELIEVE THAT MR WOULD HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER THERE'S ONLY SO MANY. DAYS AND WEEKS YOU CAN RUN AT A LOSS AND SO LOT OF PROVIDERS ARE DISCONTINUING SERVICE TO ANYBODY IN THOSE OUTLYING AREAS. AND. IT'S GETTING WORSE WITH THE PUSH TO MANAGE CARE. MANY OF THE PROVIDERS IN THE PAST WHEN IT WAS PRIMARILY FEE FOR SERVICE HAD TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE IT WORK WELL NOW THEY HAVE ON ANOTHER WHOLE PACE OF PATIENTS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO. CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICE AND MAINTAIN THEIR BUSINESS AND NOT HAVE TO RELY SO MUCH ON THE FEE FOR SERVICE SIDE. AND SO WE'RE SEEING THAT LESS AND LESS PROVIDERS ARE ARE ACCEPTING THESE PATIENTS IN THESE OUTLYING AREAS. AND IN YOUR MANAGED CARE COUNTIES. MOST OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ESPECIALLY THE ONES A COVER RURAL AREAS ARE PAYING ABOVE MEDI CAL FEE FOR SERVICE RATE AND ABOVE BEFORE OR WHAT THE TEN PERCENT CUT IT'S AND SO I WORK WITH. COUNTY SUB PARTNERSHIP NOT HEALTH PLAN THAT COVERS. I WON'T DO A BUNCH OF WORK FANS HAVE A LOT OF RURAL AREAS THAT THEY COVER AND THEY PAY WELL ABOVE THE. HUNDRED PERCENT. MEDICAID OUTBREAK THERE ADDING ANOTHER FIFTEEN TO. TWENTY FIVE PERCENT ON TOP OF THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE RECEIVING THE TRANSPORTATION NOTHING NEED. SO. THAT'S REALLY IN A NUTSHELL I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN BUSY WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME THROUGH HERE AND A LOT OF. STORIES AND SO I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME BUT. REALLY WOULD LIKE TO BE RESTORED TO PRE AB NINETY SEVEN IF I COULD JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT ARE. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GO TO MANAGE CARE THEN DROPOFF THERE'S A CONSTANT TURNING. FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER MISSING PAPERWORK PLATE ELIGIBILITY WHATEVER THAT NAY REVERT BACK INTO FEE FOR SERVICE AND THEN THEY DON'T GET THE SERVICE SAID ED THEY DON'T THERE'D. THAT THEY CAN'T GET THE NOT AMONG TO MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION THAT THEY NEED AND THAT IT'S MONTHS BEFORE THEY GET BACK ON THE MANAGED CARE SOLIS. IT'S A CONSTANT PROBLEM AT PARTICULARLY IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE BUT BEFORE SERVICE DOES AFFECT EVERYTHING OF THAT GOES ON IN MEDI CAL SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. THE NOT IMMATURE MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION WAS THE FIRST A PROVIDER GROUP TO SUFFER THE TEN PERCENT CUT. SO WHAT LOOKS LIKE PER MAY BE THE LAST TO HAVE IT RESTORED BUT WE'RE HERE TO SEE THAT RESULT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR. WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE THIRTEEN. SAYING NON OF BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. I REPRESENT ONE OF THOSE MORE RURAL PARTS OF OUR STATE AND HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING WITH SOME. MEMBERS OF CMT HAY AND. THEY WERE ABLE TO ALSO SHARE STORIES OF COMMUNITIES THAT I KNOW AND CARE ABOUT THAT. ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS YES YOU MET WITH ALBERTANS HIS IN ALBERT THAT HAS BEEN A PROVIDERS SENSE. AND I BELIEVE THE INDUSTRY FIRST STARTED IN THE MID TO LATE SEVENTIES HE'S. BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF. WELL I REALLY APPRECIATED HIS ADVOCACY AND YOURS TOO. WILL HOLD ISSUE THIRTEEN OPEN IN THE BOND ISSUE FOR TO. GET HAS TAKEN THAT IF YOU. THANK YOU GO HIT OKAY. GOOD EVENING RESEARCHER MEMBERS AND THIS IS GALIEN WITH CHILDREN NOW TERROR HERE TO ASK THAT YOU WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ENSURE ACCESS THE ASTHMA EDUCATION. AND HOME ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGER ASSESSMENTS FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. PUT POORLY CONTROLLED ASTHMA. SPECIFICALLY THE REQUEST THAT THE DEPARTMENT ENSURE MEDICARE COVERAGE QUALITY MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR QUALIFIED NON LICENSED PROFESSIONALS. TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES UNDER THE SUPERVISORS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED PRACTITIONER. IMAGINE A FAMILY WERE FOUR YEAR OLD HAS RECENTLY RETURNED FROM HER. THIRD ET VISIT FOR OUTSIDE AT THE DIRECTION OF THEIR DOCTOR THEIR VISITED BY SYLVIA A WELL TRAINED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER WHO SPEAKS THEIR LANGUAGE. TWO REVIEWS OF DOCTORS ASTHMA EDUCATION ASTHMA ACTION PLAN TO MAKE SURE THE FAMILY KNOWS HOW TO RECOGNIZE SYMPTOMS OVERSEEING ASTHMA. AND LOOKS AROUND THE FAMILY'S HOME. THAT'S ISSUE QUICKLY IDENTIFIES SEVERAL ASTHMA TRIGGERS AND EDUCATES THE FAMILY ABOUT HOW TO AT PRELIMINARY FOR REDUCE THEM. NO THAT'S OVER SUPPORT FOR THE FAMILIES WORKS. SUCH INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING THOSE PROVIDED BY QUALIFY NON LICENSED ROFESSIONALS HAVE BEEN PROVEN IN A VARIETY OF STUDIES TO REDUCE ASTHMA ET VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS AND IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. MANY STUDIES ALSO NOTE THE FINANCIAL RETURN OF INVESTMENTS FROM THESE INTERVENTIONS BY REDUCING MORE COSTLY EDIE VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY ACCESS TO THESE SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA IS VERY LIMITED. INCREASING THE USE OF QUALIFY NON LICENSED PROFESSIONAL IS AN INEFFECTIVE WAY TO PROVIDE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. POORLY CONTROLLED ASTHMA THE SUPPORT THEY NEED WE THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU BUNDLE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M DELIVERS WITH RAMP REGIONAL ASTHMA MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION. AND ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS REQUEST TO ENSURE MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL ASTHMA PREVENTION SERVICES. ASTHMA SIX SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AND DRIVER OF HEALTH CARE COSTS EFFECTIVE AS A MANAGEMENT REQUIRES A COMBINATION OF FOR VITAL COMPONENTS. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT MEDICATION PATIENT EDUCATION AND CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGERS DESERVES LAST TWO COMPONENTS ASTHMA EDUCATION AND CONTROL THEM GOVERNMENTAL TRIGGERS. WHERE THERE IS A CRITICAL GAP AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN ASTHMA CARE? ORGANIZATIONS RAMP CHILDREN NOW IN THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK HAVE BEEN AN ONGOING PROACTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES. FOR OVER TWO YEARS FROM PRIOR TO THE INTRODUCTION OF AB THREE NINETY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU LAST YEAR THAT'S OUGHT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OF THE BILL AND NOW AND NOW AFTER THE BILL'S VETO WE APPRECIATE THAT ASSISTANCE DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED ALONG THE WAY. SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT HAVE SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE DEPARTMENT'S AUTHORITY ON THIS MATTER BUT THE FACT IS THAT WE DON'T YET HAVE A CLEAR AND SYSTEM WIDE SOLUTION TO INCREASE ACCESS. TO THE SERVICES THROUGH CLINICAL DOLLARS. AT LAST THURSDAY'S HEARING OF THE SENATE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. A DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR JENNIFER CAN'T INDICATED THAT DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE BUDGET COULD BE USE A USEFUL WAY. TO INCREASING ACCESS TO THE SERVICES. SHE SPECIFICALLY REFERENCED THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET TRAILER BILL AS A POTENTIAL MODEL FOR HOW TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDED ASTHMA SERVICES. THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES HAVE ACCESS TO BE SERVICES INCLUDING WHEN THEY ARE PROVIDED BY NON LICENSE INDIVIDUAL SUCH AS A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER. SUPERVISED BY LICENSED PROVIDER THANK YOU AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS FOR. THANK YOU SIR. WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOURTEEN. MY NAME'S MARY FRAZIER I'M A REGISTERED NURSE AND I'M THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BREATH MOBILE WE PROVIDE A MOBILE ASTHMA CLINIC WITH A PROVIDER AND. ASTHMA TRAINED STAFF. AND WE SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF OUR. CLIENTS. AND I'D LIKE TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THESE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE WORKERS BEING TRAINED. TO. MAKE A LINK BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND THE HOME. ARE. ASSOCIATION OF ASTHMA EDUCATORS IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION. FOR OUR GROUP AND FOUR YEARS AGO I BEGAN WITH THE GROUP FROM MINNESOTA TO MAKE. THE EDUCATION PROTOCOL. WHETHER THAT MODULES FOR EDUCATING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS TO GO INTO A HOME AND WORK WITH A FAMILY AND TALK ABOUT ASTHMA. AND THE TRIGGERS AND THE BARRIERS TO CARE. AND LEAVE PILOT AT THIS PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN OFFERING IT IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGH DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE DOING IT. BUT THE PEOPLE WERE TRAINING WE ASK THEM TO GO OUT AS VOLUNTEERS TO DO THIS. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS AN AREA OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IF WE CAN TRAIN THESE HEALTH WORKERS. THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T HAVE LICENSES BUT THEY WORK UNDER THE SERVICE OF SOMEBODY WHO IS. TRAINED IN IT. AND. WE GIVE SOME OF ENTRY LEVEL JOB IN THE HEALTH CARE WE PAY THEM WHAT THEY'RE WORTH TO GO INTO FAMILIES AND SHOULD BE ENDED. RESOURCE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. FOR ASTHMA EDUCATION. AND CONTROLLING ASTHMA. IT'S AS MUCH A HUGE PROBLEM. IN SCHOOL ABSENTEEISM ER VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS AND. IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT THIS AND OTHER STATES THAT ARE DOING THIS THROUGH THEIR. MEDICAID. SERVICES THAT IT'S WORKING ON DECREASING ER HOSPITALIZATIONS AND ABSENTEEISM THANK YOU. AGREEMENT. OKAY MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MARILYN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ALSO PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL WE OBVIOUSLY REGRET ANYTIME CHILDREN SHOW UP IN OUR EMERGENCY ROOM BUT IT'S EVEN MORE REGRETTABLE WHEN IT'S FOR SOMETHING THAT'S PREVENTABLE SO WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS. REASONABLE PROPOSAL THINK YOU CAN. CAN REALLY COUNT THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS PROPOSAL. AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOTED WE'VE BEEN IN PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON THIS ISSUE BUT. REALLY WOULD LIKE GREATER CLARITY ON THIS IF WE ALL AGREE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO THEN. WE'D LOVE TO HEAR EXACTLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT I'M WHAT INITIAL THINGS THEY NEED FROM US IN TERMS OF RESOURCES OR OUR OR STATUTORY CHANGES OR TO MAKE THIS I. THINK YOU. THANK YOU. MARIA VALDEZ LET HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA ONE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS PROPOSAL AND SEE PAN AND AREN'T SUPPORT THINKING WE CAN. ON A HAS SUPPLIED WITH THE UNITED WAY THE CALIFORNIA AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT THINKING. MEDICARE RIGHT NOW ANDERSON PP I SURGERY CENTER AGAIN HUGE PROBLEM IN THE THIRTY THREE COUNTIES THAT WE SERVE AND WITH THE FIRES ARE INTIMATELY HAPPENED WE SEE A LOT OF THIS IN THE SAME PATIENT POPULATION. THE HUMAN. SINGLE FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOURTEEN I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. I WAS. TOUCHED BY ONE OF THE COMMENTS HERE ABOUT SCHOOL ABSENTEEISM AND RECOGNIZING THAT FRESNO THE NUMBER ONE REASON WHY KIDS MISS. CLASS HIS HOUSE MY EXACERBATIONS. AND SO WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT IF I MADE TO HELP ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE. IN THE STAFF COMMENT SECTION. CERTAINLY AGAIN WERE NAY MULLIN DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND JUST I'M FOR CLARITY PURPOSES SO WE TO COVER TODAY UNDER THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. ASTHMA AND. DELIVERY OF ASTHMA SERVICES AS WELL AS THE ABILITY FOR OUR HOME ASSESSMENTS TO BE COMPLETED. ARM THOSE ASSESSMENTS CAN BE COMPLETED BY LICENSE TISHAWN OURS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM I THINK WHERE THERE'S A DISCONNECT IS THAT UNDER OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM WE DO NOT ANIMAL I'M LICENSED PROVIDERS. SO THEY CAN'T PRACTICE AS WELL AS. COMMENTED ON BY ONE OF THE OUTCOME. PUBLIC TESTIFY OURS IS THAT THROUGH A LICENSED PHYSICIAN OR LICENSED NURSES THEY CAN DO THEIR TRAINING AND PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT AND THE SUPERVISION OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. AND THEN THEY CAN BILL FOR THOSE SERVICES OR IDENTIFY THAT THOSE SERVICES WERE THEM PROVIDED BY THOSE UNLICENSED INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED AND WERE CERTIFIED. UP UNDER THEIR DIRECTION AND SUPERVISION TONIGHT GET OF THE LEVEL OF CLARITY THAN. WHERE WOULD OUR TEAS FALL IN A LICENSED OR UNLICENSED? R. T. RESPIRATORY THERAPIST SO I THEIR LICENSE PROVIDE. BECAUSE ARE LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE A LICENSE TO PRACTICE THEIR SERVICES. SO IN OUR MEDI CAL STATE PLAN. WE LIST CALLED LICENSED PROVIDERS AND VOTE AND THERE ARE PROVIDERS THAT ARE REQUIRED OF US. TO BE IDENTIFIED IN OUR STATE PLAN BY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I'M ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HERE WAS DEALING WITH DIED CHANGES AND. FEDERAL REGULATIONS DEALING WITH THIS SERVICES THAT COULD BE PROVIDED BY UNLICENSED CARE PROVIDERS OR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. AGAIN THAT IT IS POSSIBLE BUT FOR PURPOSES OF THE MEDIC HOW PROGRAM. IF THAT PROVIDER TYPE WHEN OUT TO RENDER THAT SERVICE. WE COULD LOOK TO ESTABLISH BILLING CODES THAT INDICATED THAT THIS WAS A SERVICE PROVIDED MEANING THE HOMOSASSA MAN. UNDER THE DIRECTION AND SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED PROVIDER THEY CAN BILL FOR THAT AND THEN REIMBURSE THOSE I'M LICENSED PROVIDERS BUT WE DON'T HAVE A MECHANISM TODAY. TOO ON AND ROLL AND PAY FOR THOSE ON LICENSE CARE GIVERS DIRECTLY DO WE HAVE AN ASSESSMENT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS A COST ESTIMATE FOR THE SERVICES AS PER AB THREE NINETY ONE I WAS. PLEASE TO SUPPORT THAT BILL LAST YEAR AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF WE HAVE A COST ESTIMATE FOR THE SERVICES. MISTER CHAIR WHETHER OBAMACARE US WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DON'T HAVE A COST ESTIMATE ESTIMATE FOR THIS AT THIS TIME. WE CAN MOM PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY WE DON'T SHARE ARE ENROLLED BILLS REPORTS BUT WE DO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS I'M TO DEVELOP ESTIMATES. WHEN BILLS ARE HEARD AND. FISCAL COMMITTEE. I AM IF WE CAN GET THAT BY MAY REVISION THAT WOULD HELP US TO MAKE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS. SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENT FROM THE DYESS WILL HOLD ISSUE FOURTEEN OPEN THE BOND ISSUE FIFTY MS CHEN I THINK IT JUST THE ROOM I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR MY VOICE WILL COME BACK AND. WELCOME BACK. SORRY MISTER CHAIR. CAN REALLY CHEN ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK. I'M THAT ON BEHALF OF SEA PEN AND THE SOUTHEAST FUTURE RESOURCE ACTION CENTER WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ONE POINT FOUR MILLION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO EXPAND. THIS AGGREGATED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTION FOR ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER I THINK CITIES. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE LARGEST ASIAN AMERICAN AND SECOND LARGEST NEED APPLY IN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATIONS. THESE ARE THESE POPULATIONS ARE THE FASTEST GROWING GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WITH THE PASSAGE OF ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX BY MR BONTA TWICE SIXTEEN. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WILL NOW BEGIN COLLECTING AND. DISAGGREGATED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA FOR THE API SUBGROUP POPULATIONS. BUT AS PART OF THAT BILL. WE AGREED TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ADMINISTRATIVELY TO INCLUDE THIS. WITHIN DH CS. WITHOUT GRANULAR DISAGGREGATED DATA AT MANY SUBGROUPS WITHIN THE API POPULATION DISTINCT HEALTH DISPARITIES REMAIN UNADDRESSED AND SUBPOPULATIONS BEAT REMAIN UNACCOUNTED FOR. SO THE FIRST STEP IN BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES IS THE ACCURATE COLLECTION. AND REPORTING OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC DATA OF THOSE ENROLLING IN HEALTH COVERAGE. THROUGH WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT WE WERE I ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE EXACT AMOUNT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ORANGE INCLUDES. IN THE PROGRAM. WE ARE PLEASED TO ALSO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. IT IN THE SUPPORT IN THIS PROPOSAL. WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION NOW POLITICIZING THE SENSES WITH A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION. IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A LEADING ROLE IN ENSURING WE MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR DIVERSE POPULATION AND NOT MEANS MAKING SURE EVERYBODY COUNTS AND EVERYBODY IS INCLUDED. WE URGE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO MAKE THIS A CRITICAL INVESTMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU. WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FIFTY. GOLIA WITH THE SOUTHEAST ASIA RESOURCE ACTION CENTER WE WERE ALSO A CO SPONSOR OF AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX I AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA. WERE IN FULL SUPPORT AT THIS AND I REQUEST. CAN. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN PHENOMENON POVERTY IN SUPPORT WE CAN. MARY VALDEZ HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT BECAME. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT AMMO BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS AND. JUST THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THIS I'M THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE IS WHY ONE TIME AS THIS. IS IT. YES HELP SET UP THE SYSTEM MORE ABSOLUTELY IT'S THE ONE TIME COST TO MAKE THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES IN THE CAL HERE'S AND MET SYSTEM SO THAT THOSE INPUTS CAN BE COLLECTED WHEN INDIVIDUALS ROLE. GREAT FOOD REPRESENTING A I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING A COMMUNITY WHERE WE HAVE A LARGE MUNG POPULATION AS YOU ARE AWARE AND. OFTENTIMES THEY GET LOST IN THE API DISCUSSION AND REALLY DO. BELIEVE THAT DISAGGREGATED DATA HELPS US WITHOUT SOME WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIFTEEN OPEN IN THE BOND ISSUE SIX SO AGAIN FOR NAY MULLIN PROPER HEALTHCARE SERVICES. SO I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE I'M AND THIS IS DEALING WITH OUR PROPOSAL REGARDING THAT THREE FORTY BE PROPER. THE AGENDA DOES THOROUGHLY AND. APPROPRIATELY COVER THAT THREE FORTY BE PROPOSAL WHICH IS BASICALLY FORCED TO ELIMINATE THE USE OF THESE DRUGS. IN TERMS OF SERVING MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. AND FOR PROVIDERS FARM AND FOR PHARMACY PROVIDERS TO THEM BILL US IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR CURRENT POLICIES ON PHARMACY AND CLINIC REIMBURSEMENTS FOR DISPENSED DRUGS. PLUS THE APPLE COUPLE DISPENSING FEE. AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA THERE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS THAT ARE PLACED ON THE DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF HOW THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED. AND WE MUST HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE TO HELP ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO DUPLICATE DISCOUNTS AND TO COMPLY WITH OUR PROVE STATE PLAN. REGARDING THE USE OF AYE DISPENSE THREE FORTY BE DRUGS. WE DO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF THE THREE FORTY BE AYE PROGRAM TO COVERED ENTITIES AND TO THE POPULATIONS THEY SERVE. HOWEVER IT WASN'T UNTIL. OUR FIRST PROPOSAL IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH CONTRACTS PHARMACIES AND NOW THIS ONE DID WE WERE REALIZE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE REVENUE THAT IS GENERATED. BY THE COVERED ENTITIES WHICH IS ACHIEVED BASED UPON WHAT IS CLAIMED TO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. WE DIRT DO COULD CAR EMPIRE IN TERMS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ALEJO THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE TRANSPARENCY. IN TERMS OF THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THE COVERED ENTITIES AND HOW SUCH RESOURCES ARE USED. RELATIVE TO THE PROVISION OF THE SERVICES AND THE MATTER HOW PROGRAM. WE'VE HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE PRESENT LETTERS OF OPPOSITION TO OUR PROPOSAL. AND WE REMAIN. DILIGENT AND OUR DESIRE OF WORKING COLLABORATIVE WITH THEM REGARDING THE IMPACTS OF THIS PROPOSAL AND THEN TO ALSO CONSIDER ON POTENTIAL APPROACHES. THAT THEY WOULD LIKE US TO CONSIDER AND ALSO IS DISCUSSING THE AGENDA WE ARE WORKING ON A SAVINGS ESTIMATE RELATIVE TO THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. CATCHER MEMBER SERGIO I GO WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SO FIND AT THAT THE POOR PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE THE THREE FORTY P. DRUG REIMBURSEMENT THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. HOW'D VOCAL ALLOW THE STATE TO COMPLY WITH THE COULD THINK BETTER REQUIREMENTS. HELPS PROTECT PROGRAM INTEGRITY AND REDUCE UNNECESSARY OVERPAYMENTS ALLOW THE STATE TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL DRUG REBATES NOTHING MITIGATES ABOUT OF TIME AND RESOURCES SPENT ON RESOLVING DISPUTE THROUGH LATE AT THREE FORTY BE DRUG CLAIMS. WE ARE AS THEM WITH MULLIN MENTIONED CURLY PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A FISCAL AT THE MET FOR THE IMPACT OF THE STATE. AND DO INTENTA RELIEF ANATHEMA UP FROM A REVISION HOWEVER WE DO KNOW SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO DEVELOPING A FISCAL ETHNIC ON THE IMPACT TO COVERED ENTITIES. PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE LACK OF DATA. THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU SIR. AMBER. I THINK YOU MANY OF THEM ARE OUGHT AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT OVER FOUR HUNDRED HOSPITALS ACROSS THE STATE. INCLUDING ONE HUNDRED HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE HOSPITALS THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE THREE FORTY THE PROGRAM. WHAT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT CONGRESS ENACTED THE THREE FORTY THE PROGRAM BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO? AND THE STATED COMPRESSIONAL INTENT OF THE PROGRAM AND I QUOTE IS TO STRETCH SCARCE% FEDERAL RESOURCES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE REACHING MORE ELIGIBLE PATIENTS AND PROVIDING MORE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM HOSPITAL MUST BE EITHER A NOT FOR PROFIT ENTITY OR A PUBLICLY OWNED ENTITY. AND MUST SERVE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PATIENTS. SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE FUNDED WITH SAVINGS FROM THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM. INCLUDE OUTPATIENT CHEMOTHERAPY CENTERS MOBILE AND PRIMARY CARE CLINICS DIABETES SCREENING HEPATITIS C. TREATMENT AND HIV CLINICS. THESE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ARE REACHING DIRECTLY INTO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND FOR SOME OF THE SMALL AND RURAL HOSPITALS ACROSS OUR STATE. THE SAVINGS REALLY DO MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KEEPING THEIR DOORS OPEN AND HAVING THE CLOSE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM FOR MEDI CAL BUT NOT ONLY REDUCE ACCESS TO VITAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IT WOULD ALSO SEVER A LIFELINE THAT PROVIDES FREE DRUGS TO VULNERABLE PATIENTS. IF HOSPITALS ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO PURCHASE DRUGS THROUGH THE THREE FORTY PROGRAM. THEY WILL BE FORCED TO PURCHASE THEM AT THE WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST. WHICH CAN BE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE THREE FORTY BE PRICE. AND THIS IS PER A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT THAT SAYS THREE FORTY BE COVERED ENTITIES CANNOT PURCHASE DRUGS THROUGH GROUP PURCHASING ARRANGEMENTS SO THEY REALLY WOULD BE PAYING THE HIGHEST PRICE ON THESE DRUGS IN THE MARKET. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD COST HOSPITAL'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND THAT THE STATE WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO CLAIM THE REBATES ON THESE DRUGS THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THAT WILL OCCUR. BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS THE LA. REPORTED THE STATE ONLY GETS TO KEEP ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE REBATES. MEANING THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE DOLLARS WOULD BE SENT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND INSTEAD OF KEEPING THESE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SAVINGS WITHIN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE SEND THEM TO WASHINGTON DC. WHICH IS INCREDIBLY CONCERNING FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. NATURALLY THAT IF THERE ARE LESS DOLLARS IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THERE IS GOING TO BE AN IMPACT ON ACT. AND THOSE THREE FORTY THE HOSPITALS THAT TREAT THE LARGEST PORTION OF MEDICAL PATIENTS. WILL BE DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED BY THIS PROPOSAL AND THEY WILL BE FORCED TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE SERVICES. AND THERE WILL NOT BE ACCESS TO THESE FREE DRUGS FOR THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. BUT THERE OUR SOLUTIONS TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL RELEASED A REPORT. THAT STUDIED HOW THIRTY SEVEN DIFFERENT STATES HAVE FOUND WAYS TO IDENTIFY THREE FORTY BE CLAIMS IN MEDICAID MANAGED CARE CLINICS. AND ONE EXAMPLE. WAS THAT HOSPITALS HEALTH PLANS CLINICS VENDORS COULD SUBMIT A FILE TO THE STATE THAT GIVES THEM ALL OF THE DATA THEY NEED TO IDENTIFY THE THREE FORTY BE CLAIMS AND EXCLUDE THEM FROM THEIR REBATE REQUEST. AND IN FACT CALIFORNIA APPROVED A MODEL THAT DOES JUST THAT IF WITH PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND THAT MODEL HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND IT DOES REQUIRE THAT THE STATE RECEIVE A FILE. WITH THE NECESSARY ELEMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN IDENTIFY AND EXCLUDE THREE FORTY BE DRUGS FROM THEIR REBATE REQUESTS. WHICH REALLY BRINGS INTO QUESTION WHY CAN'T NOT TYPE OF A MODEL BE EXPANDED ACROSS THE STATE. SO WE CAN PRESERVE THE PROGRAM AND ENSURE FEDERAL COMPLIANCE. AND FINALLY I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT LAST MONTH THE STATE DID RELEASE A DRAFT ALL PLANNED LETTER FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. AND ONCE STATED PURPOSE ABOUT APL WAS TO CLARIFY THE PLANS RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO REPORTING DRUGS PURCHASED THROUGH THE THREE FORTY PROGRAM. THE A CAL CLEARLY OUTLINES THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PLAN IDENTIFY THREE FORTY BE DRUGS AT THE CLAIM LEVEL USING NATIONALLY STANDARD INDICATORS. AND IT ALSO REQUIRES THE PLANS HAVE FORMAL POLICIES IN PLACE TO PREVENT DUPLICATE DISCOUNTS WITH CONTRACT PHARMACIES. IN OUR OPINION THAT IT FELT PROVIDE SOME VIABLE SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE DEPARTMENT'S CONCERNS AND WE REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT. TO SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE THESE SOLUTIONS A REALITY. HOSPITALS ARE COMMITTED TO BEING GOOD STEWARDS OF THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM AND WE SUPPORT REPORTING MODIFICATIONS THAT WOULD STRENGTHEN PROGRAM INTEGRITY AND. BUT THE PROPOSED ONE FRONT ABOUT THAT FAR TOO EXTREME. AND IT WOULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON ACCESS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE BY SAYING THAT NO OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY HASN'T ACTED SUCH A HARMFUL POLICY. AND I ASK THAT THIS COMMITTEE PLEASE REJECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S FOR. WE GIVE THEM. COOPER. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE HEALTH CENTER PERSPECTIVE ON THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE IT PLAYS IN SUPPORTING ACCESS TO CARE. MY NAME IS PRETTY GUERRERO I'M THE CEO OF THE SACRAMENTO NATIVE AMERICAN HEALTH CENTER A NONPROFIT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER. PROVIDING CARE TO OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PATIENTS IN AND AROUND SACRAMENTO. I'M A PROUD THEM A PROUD BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION. THE CENTRAL VALLEY HEALTH NETWORK AND THE CONCERTS THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM FOR URBAN INDIAN HEALTH. TODAY I'D LIKE TO START BY SHARING MY HEALTH CENTERS THREE FORTY BE STORY. AND THEN PROVIDE SOME STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM. FOR THE OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER SITES THAT SERVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE HIGH QUALITY CARE TO SIX POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE THAT'S ONE IN SIX CALIFORNIANS. OUR HEALTH CENTER HAS BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THE THREE FORTY P. PROGRAM SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. THE BEST SERVER PATIENTS WE HAVEN'T INTO IN HOUSE PHARMACY AND SEVENTEEN CONTRACT PHARMACIES. THIS MODEL ALLOWS OUR PATIENTS TIMELY ACCESS TO PHARMACEUTICALS. INCLUDING SPECIALTY DRUGS PATIENTS CAN PICK UP THEIR MEDICATIONS RIGHT AFTER THEY SEE THEIR PROVIDER OR SUBMIT A REFILL TO A PHARMACY CLOSER TO THEIR HOME. SNACK WHICH IS THE ACRONYM FOR HEALTH CENTER DEPENDS ON THREE FORTY BE SAVINGS TO EMPLOYMENT BIRDS OF OUR CARE TEAMS SUCH AS CARE TEAM NURSES CASE MANAGERS REFERRAL COORDINATORS AND OTHER POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT. THESE CARE COORDINATION SERVICES ARE CRITICAL TO MAKING SURE THE COMPLEX NEEDS OF OUR PATIENT POPULATION ARE BEING MET BY CONNECTING PATIENTS WITH COVERAGE ENROLLMENT TRANSPORTATION TRANSLATION SERVICES. IN IN NETWORKING OUT A NETWORK SPECIALISTS AND OTHER SUPPORT OF SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. THEREFORE UNABLE TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATION IN THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM UNDER FEE FOR SERVICE. AND MANAGE CARE MEDI CAL WE MAY ALSO NEED TO CLOSE OUR IN HOUSE PHARMACY. THIS WOULD DISRUPT PHARMACEUTICAL ACCESS FOR ALL OF OUR PATIENTS AND FOR MANY RAISING COSTS WE PROVIDE LOW IN FREE MEDICATION THE UNINSURED. AS RESPONSIBLE PARTICIPANTS IN THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM WE'VE CONTRACTED A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. WHO HELPED TO TRACK OR THREE FORTY BE DRUGS AND HELPS TO ELIMINATE DUPLICATE DISCOUNTS UNDER THE THREE FORTY PROGRAM? WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO COLLABORATE WITH THE STATE PHARMACIES PLANS AND OTHER COVERED ENTITIES. ON WAYS TO ENSURE THE APPROPRIATE DRUG DISCOUNT INFORMATION IS BEING REPORTED AN AUDIT. FEW THINGS I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT US FIRST THE STATE WHY PROPOSAL AND PURSED HER STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE ON THREE FORTY BE. IF ENACTED THIS PROPOSAL WILL HAVE DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON HEALTH CENTERS IN THE ULTIMATELY HARM ACCESS FOR LOW INCOME AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. WE LIKE OUR THREE FORTYB. ENTITY COVERED POT COLLEAGUES. ON THIS PANEL ARE CONCERNED WITH A HASTY PROPOSAL. THE ADMINISTRATION ARGUES THEY'RE PROPOSING NEW LEGISLATION TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A MINT AT MISINTERPRETATION OF THE OF THE CURRENT LAW. FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE ELIMINATION OF THE PROGRAMMING MEDICAID. BUT RATHER CLAIMS THAT STATES% HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO IDENTIFY TRACK OUGHT IN AUDIT THREE FORTY BE CLAIMS. ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER STAND READY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION AND STAKEHOLDERS TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT INSURANCE PROGRAM INTEGRITY. WERE ALL THREE FORTY BURKE BE DRUGS ARE APPROPRIATELY CODED CLAIMED AND THEREBY CREATE ASSURANCE THAT THE STATE WILL HAVE NO DUPLICATE DISCOUNTS. BUILDING THE SYSTEM TOGETHER WILL HELP TO HELP THE STATE RECEIVE MORE REBATES LOWER COSTS AND OUR COMMUNITY SOME PATIENTS WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS. PRINT COVERED ENTITIES PARTICIPATING AT THREE FORTY P.. THERE ARE MODELS IN OUR STATE AND OTHER STATES WERE THREE FORTY BE CLAIMS ARE IDENTIFIED TRACKED AND AUDITED AND WE ARE CONFIDENT WE CAN BILL FROM THOSE SYSTEMS ALREADY IN PLACE. IN CLOSING THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR CREATING A SPACE FOR THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. WITH OF FEDERAL POLICY ENVIRONMENT THAT CONTINUES TO THREATEN AND DESTABILIZE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT. CALIFORNIA. NEEDS TO BE INVESTING AND SUPPORTING BOTH COVERAGE AND ACCESS AND NOT TAKING AWAY ONE TO SUPPORT ANOTHER. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU AM THAT WE'VE EXPECT WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO REJECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM. AND AS YOU CONTINUE YOUR DELIBERATIONS. THE HEALTH CENTER COMMUNITY LOOKS FORWARD TO BEING A RESOURCE TO YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MA'AM. FULLY OF. I'VE BEEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA SHOW UP THIS WINTER WE CONDUCT ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S THREE FORTY BE. PROPOSAL AND. ULTIMATELY CAME TO RECOGNIZE A LOT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES ARE CAUSED BY THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE PROGRAM AND THE MEDICAID DRUG REBATE PROGRAM CHALLENGES THAT HAVE GROWN I THINK IN RECENT YEARS. AND WE WE CAME WE ALSO AGREED THAT THAT THE PROPOSED ELIMINATION THE PROGRAM WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN IN SAVINGS WHICH WE LOOK FORWARD TO AN ESTIMATE. AT THE MAY REVISION THESE RICH THESE HIGHER SAVINGS WE RECOGNIZE WOULD. BE IN PLACE OF A OF A PORTION OF THE SAVINGS THAT THREE FORTY BE COVERED ENTITIES DO GET TO RETAIN THROUGH THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM. AND ALL WE FOUND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES MEET MERIT SERIOUS CONSIDERATION DUE TO THE SAVINGS THAT WOULD BE. GENERATED. THE REDUCTION IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES AND THE. CUT COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAWS AND RULES ABOUT PREVENTING DUPLICATE DISCOUNTS. WHICH WHICH WOULD BE ACHIEVED UNDER THE PROPOSAL. SINCE THE SAVINGS WOULD ULTIMATELY BENEFIT THE GENERAL FUND WE WE BELIEVE THESE EX ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM PRESCRIPTION DRUG DISCOUNTS WOULD DIE GIVE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE FLEXIBILITY OF HOW TO TARGET THESE RESOURCES. AND TO PURSUE ITS PRIORITIES AND BELIEVE THAT WOULD ALLOW A WOULD MAXIMIZE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF HOW THESE DISCOUNT SAVINGS. ARE ULTIMATELY TARGETED IN USED SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO WITH THE SAVINGS INCLUDE AUGMENTING OF THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM IN NEW WAYS YEAH OR A COULD BE TO DEDICATING. RESOURCES TO THE COVERED ENTITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THAT THAT THE CHANGES THAT WOULD OCCUR UNDER THIS PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT ACCESS DOESN'T BECOME. A PROBLEM FOR. CERTAIN THE HOSPITALS OR ENTITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BENEFITING UNDER THE PROGRAM. WE DO RECOMMEND THAT BEFORE REACHING A DECISION. THE LEGISLATURE REQUEST FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT'S THE SAVINGS ESTIMATE AND ALSO THAT IT TO GET DOES GATHERADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON HOW THE PROPOSED CHANGES WOULD DIE. WOULD IMPACT COVERED ENTITIES AND THEN FINALLY OUR REPORT DOES PROVIDE A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF CERTAIN ALTERNATIVES TO THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL WHICH WE CAN GET INTO IF IF THE LEGISLATURE IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES SIXTEEN. DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS TERRY CALGARY HILL ON BEHALF OF THE HUMOROUSLY COUNCIL CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THE PATIENTS WHO HAVE RARE BLEEDING DISORDERS SUCH AS HEMOPHILIA VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE. WE SUPPORT STRONGLY SUPPORT OUR HEMOPHILIA TREATMENT CENTERS THOSE ARE GENERALLY CLINICS THAT ARE LOCATED WITHIN CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTERS THERE ARE A COUPLE OF STAND ALONE. BUT THEY BASICALLY PROVIDE THE CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS WHO NEED TO SEE THEIR HEMATOLOGIST AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE CARE PLAN. THE HTC'S ARE OPERATING UNDER VERY STRICT FEDERAL LAWS SO THEY HAVE TO REPORT TO HER CELL WEPT WHEN THEY RECEIVE GRANTS AND SO THEY HAVE TO REPORT ALL OF THEIR INCOME AND. FACTOR FOR OUR HEMOPHILIA PATIENTS IS CARVED OUT OF MEDI CAL FEE FOR SERVICE AND IS PAYER EXCUSE ME OUT ABOUT IT HOW MANAGED CARE AND IS PAID DIRECTLY THROUGH FEE FOR SERVICE ON A SEPARATE. WILL TALK ABOUT THE FACT IRATE LATER BUT BASICALLY ALL OF THE ON ABILITY FOR THE HUMANLY TREATMENT CENTERS TO PURCHASE THAT IT DISCOUNT ALL OF THE PROFITS ARE REINVESTED INTO THOSE HEMOPHILIA THINGS SUCH AS. THE ULTRASOUND MACHINES THAT LOOK INTO THE JOINTS OF THE HEMOPHILIA PATIENTS THAT LEAD INTO THEIR JOINTS THE OLD DAYS WE JUST HAVE THE HEMATOLOGIST PRESCRIBE MORE CLOTTING FACTOR. IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE AND SO NOW THE DOCTORS AND THE STAFF AT THE TREATMENT CENTERS CAN LOOK INTO THE JOINTS AND SEE HEY MAYBE WE CAN JUST ON ORDER SOME PHYSICAL THERAPY OR NOT AS MUCH FACTOR. TO PREVENT A FURTHER PLEASE AND JOINT DAMAGE SO THE MONEY THAT COMES TO BACK INTO THE CENTERS IS USED VERY WISELY AND RESPONSIBLY THEY HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE FEDS AND SO. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT I'M POSITIVE SOLUTIONS THANK YOU. I CAN. BRENT SPENCE ARE BEHALF THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S OF CALIFORNIA WHAT CONCERNS THE PROPOSAL AS WELL. UP GRANDPARENT HEALTH CENTERS OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEALTH CENTERS ROCK CALIFORNIA SERVE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS ANNUALLY PASSED EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THOSE PATIENTS ARE. FROM ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL LAST YEAR THE LAST YEAR FEDERAL THREATS ASIDE YOU CAN IMAGINE THE FINANCIAL BAND BALANCING ACT WE FACE WITH. PROVIDING QUALITY SERVICE FOR PATIENTS WHILE MANAGING OVERHEAD COSTS AS A SAFETY NET PROVIDER. TODAY PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEALTH CENTERS OPERATE IN THE CONTEXT OF A FEDERAL MINISTRATION SEEKING THE CITY S. WASTE OVERCOME. COME AFTER OUR PATIENTS AND THE BASIC HEALTH CARE WE PROVIDE. OUR DOORS OPEN ALL CALIFORNIANS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH SERVICES AND THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM IS A VITAL PART OF THE CONTRACEPTION VACCINATION STI TREATMENT SERVICES WE OFFER. OVER YEARS AFFILIATES HAVE PARTNERED WITH DEPARTMENT ON PROPER BILL WHEN YOU SING. IN UT MODIFIERS WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO USE THAT THIRTY THREE FORTY BE. S. HAVE. USED THEIR THREE FORTY BE SERVE OUR PICK MEDICAL PATIENTS SO WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OUR PATIENTS WILL EXPERIENCE AND THIS TYPE OF PROPOSAL. THEREFORE WE URGE CAUTION AS YOU PROCEED CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAYOR MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THIS PROPOSAL. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ALIGN MYSELF WITH ALL THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE WITH A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. AND JUST ADD THAT WE ARE. ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO HELPING WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH HEALTH PLANS TO MAKE SURE WE CAN I HANDLE AND SO RESOLVE ISSUES AROUND DUPLICATE DISCOUNTS. BUT PHILIP THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSALS A VERY INEFFICIENT WAY TO DO THAT IT WOULD EFFECTIVELY TAKE TWO THIRDS OF THE BENEFIT OF THE PROGRAM ON THE MEDICAL SIDE OUT OF THE STATE AND SEND THEM ELSEWHERE SO IF THIS IS ABOUT MORE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. IT'S NOT AN EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THAT IF IT'S ABOUT A BETTER OVERSIGHT OR TRANSPARENCY IT'S NOT AN EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THAT. ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING JUST I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT THREE FORTY PROGRAM IS REALLY IT'S NOT A COST TO THE DEPARTMENT IT'S NOT ACOSTA THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND IT'S NOT ACOSTA TAXPAYERS. THE WAY THAT THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED IS BAD ALL PAYERS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WE CONTINUE TO REIMBURSE. HOSPITALS FOR THE COSTS OF THE DRUGS THAT THEY PROVIDE OUT THE WAY THAT THEY HAD AT THE COST THAT THEY HAVE BEEN REIMBURSING. THE SAME TYPE DRUG COMPANIES HAVE TO SELL THOSE DRUGS AT A LOWER PRICE AND WHAT THAT DOES IS CREATE A GAP. WHERE THE HOSPITAL HAS EXTRA RESOURCES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE? BUT PROGRAM NOT TAXPAYERS THIS IS A VERY YOU KNOW EFFICIENT SYSTEM ARE ESPECIALLY AT HEMERY ABOUT DRUG PRICES AND FEEL THE DRUG COMPANIES MAY BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PATIENTS THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF PROPOSAL WE SHOULD BE. A TRYING TO EXPAND NOT SHRINK AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE YOU TO REJECT IT AND WE DO COMMIT THAT WE WILL WORK OUT TO FIND HIM A BETTER SOLUTION THAT'S MORE WORKABLE. THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M FAIR MAKE THEY TING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES MY REMARKS ARE ALSO I'M IN MIND WITH THE URBAN COUNTIES.

PARTNERS AT OUR HOSPITALS ARE VERY DIVERSE AND SOME ARE RULING CRITICAL ACCESS HAS BEEN MENTIONED OTHERS ARE I AM URBAN AND SUBURBAN BUT.

HAVE BUT WE DO URGE THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO REJECT THIS ONE BECAME. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS STEPHANIE DANCE GROWN I'VE A THIRTY ONE YEAR OLD SON WAS SEVERE HEMOPHILIA SO I'M HERE TO GIVE A NAME A FACE AND VOICE TO THE ISSUE AT HAND. HEMOPHILIA TREATMENT CENTERS VIRTUALLY SAVED MY SON'S LIFE. BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED AT THAT TIME HE WAS PART OF A CLINICAL TRIAL HE WAS SPARED FROM HIV AS WELL AS HEPATITIS C. WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS CALLED HEPATITIS NON A. NON B.. WHO SPARED FROM MANY INTER CRANIAL? HEMORRHAGES THAT COULD HAVE LED TO. BRAIN DAMAGE OR EVEN WORSE DEATH.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS MEGAN SUPERSONIC HAVE OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND CLINICS RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. I'M I FIRST WANT TO START BY SAYING I THINK YOU KNOW YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THIS EVENING THAT. THIS PROPOSAL WILL JUST MAKE IT LESS BURDENSOME PERHAPS FOR THE STATE TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM AND ALSO THAT THE STATE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF SOME OF THE DOLLARS. AND PERHAPS THEY WOULD I JUST GO INTO THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND THERE'S NO OF REQUIREMENT RIEBEN RECOMMENDATION THAT THESE DOLLARS GO BACK IN THE MEDI CAL. WHICH I THINK IS A A BIG CONCERN FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT THESE DOLLARS ARE CURRENTLY. BEING USED BY COVERED ENTITIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT THEY OTHERWISE CANNOT AFFORD AND SO IF WE ARE TAKING THAT OFF THE TABLE AND SAYING WE ARE WE NEED TO TAKE THESE DOLLARS TO GIVE TO THE STATE. BUT THE STATE MAY NOT GIVE THEM BACK TO YOU TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES ON THE BACK AND THAT'S A BIG CONCERN SO WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. JUST FOR THE RECORD AVAIL OURSELVES AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE WE WE HOPE TO I'M. HOPE THE STATE DETERMINE A LESS BURDENSOME WAY TO TRACK THESE REBATES RATHER THAN ON THE MAIN THE PROGRAM THANK YOU BECAME. GOOD EVENING I'M SIR HAS GET WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS ALSO RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE. GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE A TWO WOULDN'T WHAT ECHO MIKE I WOULD SYMPATHIZE AN ECHO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES. I'M COMMENTS HERE TODAY AND WE JUST HIGHLIGHT TWO QUICK THINGS ONE IS. THIS THE MORE MEDI CAL PATIENTS THAT WE SEE THE GREATER THE IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL IT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS SAFETY NET PROVIDERS. AND REALLY CAN IMPACT THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TODAY. SECOND WE TO STAND READY TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE STATE AND COMING UP WITH SOME ALTERNATIVES THAT CAN BOTH PRESERVE THE PROGRAM'S INTEGRITY. AND ALLOW US TO COME INTO FEDERAL COMPLAINTS THINKING BECAME. KELLY BRICKS ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF RIVERSIDE SANTA CLARA AND VENTURA COUNTIES ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS AND BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. ALL IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. ONE THING ALL MY CLIENTS HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY'RE PUBLIC ENTITIES OPERATING ON VERY THIN MARGINS THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE VERY DEVASTATING TO SOME OF THEM. FOR HOPEFUL THAT THERE THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE THAT COULD BE. PURSUED AND THAT THE CONVERSATION MAY TAKE A DIFFERENT TURN AND I THINK YOU THE COMMAND. THOUGHT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION ON HFS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF CARE AND TREATMENT OF PEOPLE WITH HIV IN THE WORLD. EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PATIENTS WORLDWIDE IN FORTY COUNTRIES BUT A VERY LARGE PRESENCE HERE IN OUR HOME STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE THREE FORTY BE PROVIDER OF THOSE FUNDS ARE IMPORTANT FOR A COUPLE REASONS ONE. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT PAY WHO ARE NOT COVERED BY MEDICAL ON WHO WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO SECOND IS WE PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES THAT GO BEYOND WHAT IS ALLOWED UNDER CURRENT LAW. BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT RANGE OF SERVICES KEEPS PEOPLE ON THEIR TREATMENT REGIMEN. I'M WE HAVE A VIRAL LOAD UNDETECTABLE RATE AT AGE HALF OF EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. AND THAT'S REMARKABLE GIVEN WHERE IT IS THEN THE REST OF THE STATE. ON TOP OF WHICH THAT HAS A HUGE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT BECAUSE IF YOUR VIRAL LOAD UNDETECTABLE YOU ARE NOT TRANSMITTING THE VIRUS. ON VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THESE FUNDS CONTINUE TO. TO SUPPORT THOSE SERVICES WE DO SUPPORT A NEGOTIATION ON ON ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT CONVERSATION BUT WOULD HAVE TO REJECT THE. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THINK IT'S HER. I A MATCHING TRULY FROM THE CENTER FOR INHERITED BLOOD DISORDERS AND HEMOPHILIA TREATMENT CENTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ARE CENTER WAS A THREE FORTY BE LEAD IN PRACTICE SAY. AND WE WOULD LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM INTEGRITY WE'VE ALWAYS ACTED IN BUT THAT THAT'S INTEGRITY OF THE PROGRAM. WE USE OUR FUNDS TO FIND IT DREAMILY GOOD OUTPATIENT SERVICES WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE THESE PROGRAMS AND OUR PATIENTS WOULD END UP BACK IN THE HOSPITAL. SO PLEASE. SAY THE PURPOSE. THANK YOU SIR. AFTERNOON CRAIG PULLS FROM BEHALF OF A KILLER HEALTH IN THE CALIFORNIA HIV ALLIANCE FOR A COALITION OF EIGHTEEN HIV SERVICE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE. HERE IN STRONG OPPOSITION AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION FOR HIV. AND STDS THESE FUNDS ARE CUR THESE. SAVINGS ARE CURRENTLY IS TO EXPAND HIV AND STD SERVICE HAS INCLUDING CASE MANAGEMENT PROP NAVIGATION AND AS TO THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION AND MANY OTHER SERVICES. AND THERE'S CERTAINLY NO GUARANTEE THAT THOSE FUNDS WILL BE REINVESTED SO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED ON THESE EPIDEMICS THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. HI DEVON ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF THE CEMETERY COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE ELIMINATION OF THE PROGRAM WOULD ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AND ALSO AT THE SAN MATEO COUNTY. HEALTH SYSTEM. ANTICIPATES A TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO PERCENT INCREASE IN MEDICAL PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS HOME IF THIS WERE TO GO THROUGH THANK YOU SO MUCH THE COMMAND. MICHAEL MORTAL MEN ON BEHALF OF THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S THREE FORTY BE PROPOSAL AND URGING YOU TO REJECT IT. THANK YOU MA'AM. HI MY NAME'S RAN REGAL I'M A SEVERE FACTORY CAN FEEL THAT COUP IS ACTUALLY PATIENT AT THE INFILL TREATMENT CENTER THAT STEPHANIE DANCER WORKS AT. I'M IN OPPOSITION TO THE CUTS TO THIS PROGRAM AND PROGRAMS THAT WOULD TAKE WITH FUNDS FROM THE EXXON SERVICES I GET AT THAT HEMOPHILIA TREATMENT CENTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIXTEEN I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVIEW. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE YOU. COMING UP AND TESTIFYING. BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. I HEARD SEVERAL THINGS AND I WILL TRY TO. OF. ASK SPECIFICALLY UP THERE WERE IS A COMIC ABOUT COST SAVINGS FOR THE STATE. AND I DON'T I'M NOT QUITE SURE. IF. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE COST SAVINGS WOULD I BE BE REALIZED IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT TO. US ABSOLUTELY SO. A DRUG CAN EITHER RECEIVE A DISCOUNT. YOU CAN EITHER PLAY DISCOUNT THAT ESSENTIALLY THAT DRUG MANUFACTURERS PAYING FOR. EITHER TO A COVERED ENTITY THROUGH THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM OR THROUGH A MEDICAID DRUG REBATE SO THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE PROGRAMS AND. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AND ISSUES IS THAT WE'RE HAVING A CHALLENGE OF. AT SOMETIMES ACCIDENTALLY OR ARE UNINTENTIONALLY. GET IT GET IT TRYING TO GET DISCOUNTS ON BOTH AND SO. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THAT WE WOULD GET THE MEDICAID DRUG REBATE? AND THAT COVERED ENTITIES WOULD HAVE TO FOREGO THE THREE FORTY BE DISCOUNT. YES BUT THAT HOW DOES THAT GIVE US GIVE THE STATE SAVINGS. BECAUSE. MY UNDERSTAND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE WORK IS BAIT THAT DISCOUNTS ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY COMPARABLE AND HOW THEY'RE CONSTRUCTED IT SAGA IT'S A PERCENTAGE DISCOUNT OR. THE REQUIREMENT FOR DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE THE BEST PRICE. THAT'S AVAILABLE TO ANY SORT OF MOST PRIVATE PAYERS AND A LOT A LOT OF PUBLIC PAYERS TO. THAT THE ESSENTIALLY THE STATUTE OF THE STATUTORY DISCOUNT IS THE SAME FOR BOTH THE THREE FORTY BE ENTITY AND FOR THE MEDICAID PROGRAM IT'S JUST THAT YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE OF THE PRO ONE GET IT AND THE OTHER CANNOT FINISH AND I WOULD. LIKE I COULD JUST. NO I UNDERSTAND THAT PART I THINK WHAT I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING IS HOW WOULD THAT DIRECTLY BENEFIT THE STATE ARE HOW WHAT. WHO WHO WOULD GET THE DISK WHO WOULD GET THE COST SAVINGS WILL HELP WITH THAT IT WOULD BE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE MEDICARE MEDICAID LIKE I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY? SO THE THE. FOR ALL MEDICAID REBATES FOR MEDI CAL. WE COLLECT THE DHS COLLECTS THOSE REBATES AND THEY OFFSET GENERAL FUND SPENDING IN THE PROGRAM AND SO IT ESSENTIALLY WOULD REDUCE THE GENERAL FUND OBLIGATION TO SORT OF FIND. MEDI CAL ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AND SO THAT WOULD FREE UP ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND RESOURCES FOR. FOR OTHER USES. OKAY BUT BUT IF THE SO SO BUT THREE FORTY BE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THAT. THEY WOULD GET THE DISCOUNT BUT THEN IN THE MEANTIME THE THREE FORTY BPM. IS BEING PAID TO THE CLINICS INTO THE. HOSPITALS BUT. OKAY. BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THESE THE SAVINGS WOULD BE IN PLACE OF SAVINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUT RETAIN TO AT LEAST SOME EXTENT BY THREE FORTY BE ENTITIES AND POTENTIALLY OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THAT IN IN THE. IN SORT OF STUFF UP THE PAYMENT CHAIN. OKAY BUT IF AN AND I'M AGAIN I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS BECAUSE. IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THOUGH IS IT FROM PREVIOUS COMMENTS WAS THAT IT WAS BEING DOUBLE. A REBATED SO THE STATE IS TALKING THE REBATE AND THEN SO WAS THAT THREE FORTY BE. PROVIDERS ARE STILL GETTING SO SOFT. I CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND HOW THE DISCOUNT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU'RE STILL GETTING BUT THIS COUNTS ANYWAY WHAT YEARS WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THERE'S DOUBLE REBATES. AND SO THE STATE IS STILL GETTING THE THE DISCOUNT OR THE. THE. THE SAVINGS THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT. OKAY SO LET ME JUST UNDERSTAND THE SOUL SO PART OF THE ISSUE FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN READING AND FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING IS THAT THERE'S DOUBLE AHA DISCOUNTS. TO ME THAT MEANS THE STATE STILL GETTING THE DISCOUNTS ARE STILL GETTING THE REPEATS. CORRECT AND SO IF THEY'RE GETTING THAT I KNOW AND I'M TRYING TO KIND OF VERBAL AND THAT HERE SO IF YOU'RE STILL GETTING THE BUT DISCOUNT AND THEN THE THREE FORTY BE. ABOUT FOLKS ARE GETTING THE DISCOUNT YOU'RE ALREADY GETTING IN MY MIND YOU'RE ALREADY GETTING. THAT SAVING BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY BEING REALIZED BY WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE DOUBLE. OUT WE A REIMBURSEMENT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. AND FEDERAL ROUTE RULES BAR US FROM GETTING THE DOUBLE DISCOUNTS AND SO THERE ARE PROCESSES IN PLACE. TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING NO NO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IN THE MEAN RIGHT THIS MINUTE THERE WERE STILL GETTING THE REBATES THE STATE'S THEY'RE GETTING THE REBATES AND THE POINT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE REBATE SO THEN. THE SOUL I DON'T SEE WHERE THE SAVINGS WOULD COME FROM BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY RECEIVING THE. BUT REPEAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE'RE NOT COLLECTING THE MEDICAID REBATE ON THE ON THE VAST MAJORITY PROBABLY OF THE THREE FORTY BE DRUGS THAT ARE TAGGED THAT WAY BUT I WOULD DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT. SO BRING A MONOLOGUE SO. WHEN DRUGS ARE BUILT TO THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE CERTAIN PRICING METHODOLOGIES FOR HOW. PHARMACIES CLINICS ARE SUPPOSED TO BELLA'S. IF THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM. IT NEEDS TO BE SUBMITTED IN THE CLAIM THAT THIS DRUG THAT HAS BEEN DISPENSED COME REIMBURSED IS A THREE FORTY BE DRUG. WE DO NOT HAVE THAT TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS ABOUT REPORTING FOR THOSE DRUGS SO WHEN WE ENTER INTO REBATE AGREEMENTS WITH MANUFACTURERS AND THEN WE WORK OUT. THE DRUGS THAT HAD BEEN. AND REIMBURSE THE DEPARTMENT IF THEY'RE NOT IDENTIFIED AS BEING A THREE FORTY BE WE SUBMIT AN INVOICE TO THAT MANUFACTURERS THEY WILL COME BACK IN DISPUTE AND SAY NO. THERE ARE THREE FORTY BE DRUGS ON THIS INVOICE AND SO THEN THEY LOOKED AT THE DEPARTMENT TO RECONCILE WHICH OF THOSE DRUGS ORDER IN THAT INVOICE ARE ACTUALLY THREE FORTY BE DRUGS VERSUS NOT. AND UNTIL WE CAN CLARIFY. INCORRECT THAT DISPUTED INVOICE WHERE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO COLLECT THE REBATES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT BUT THEN IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THAT IT'S A DEPARTMENT ISSUE. BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE PROPER. FLORIDA CALLS OR WHATEVER IT IS TO NOT SEND WELL THAT HAVES WE HAVE STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES PARTICIPATING ENTITIES IN THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM. TED BILL PASSED AT THE RATE IN WHICH THEY ACQUIRED THE DRUG RIGHT UNDER THREE FOUR GB SO IF IT'S NOT BEING. COMMUNICATED TO WHAT'S. AND THEY'RE REIMBURSING NOT OR THEY'RE CLAIMING TO US A DIFFERENT AMOUNT WE DON'T KNOW WHICH OF THOSE DRUGS ARE ACTUALLY THREE FORTY BEAVER SAYS NOT SO WE THEN DON'T PUT THOSE CLAIMS. INTO THE SAME BUCKET PROCLAIMING THE REBATES OR THE DISCOUNTS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THOSE. UP DRUGS I MEAN WHAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES BECAUSE IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WAS ALSO AROUND THE USE OF CONTACT PHARMACY. AND ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER HER CELL WHICH OVERSEES THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM IS THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A. CONTRACT PHARMACY ARRANGEMENT BOTH THE THREE FORTY BE ENTITY THAT CONTRACT PHARMACY AND THE DEPARTMENT HAVE TO INTO. ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ONE ANOTHER IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE CONTRACT PHARMACIES THAT ARE IN USE. BUT WE ONLY HAVE ONE AGREEMENT RIGHT NOW THAT WE ARE WHERE OUT WITH THE HEALTH PLAN WITH PARTNERSHIP HELP OKAY SO THEN. SO WE HAVE SO SO. THE CHALLENGES CONTRACT PHARMACIES. MAY NOT RECOGNIZE OR REALIZE THAT FOR THE CLAIMS THAT THEY ARE SUBMITTING TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY A THREE FORTY BE DRUG. SO THEY ARE NOW BILLING US AT A HIGHER OUR. RATE. AND THAT WERE NOW REIMBURSING THEM AND THEN ON THE BACK AND THERE WAS A RECONCILIATION PROCESS THAT IS HAPPENING BETWEEN THE MANUFACTURER AND THE THREE FORTY BE ENTITY. AND THAT DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS REIMBURSED SAID THAT PHARMACY PROVIDER AND THAT RECONCILED A REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS THAT SAVINGS. THAT IS BEING GENERATED AND MAINTAINED BY THE THREE FORTY BE ENTITIES TO DO THE THINGS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE SPOKE ABOUT TED RIGHT BUT THEN SO THEN TURNED. TO ME AND AGAIN. I'M A TEACHER NOT A. MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL BUT. FOR ME WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IS. AND THAT'S JUST IN SIMPLE TERMS AND OBVIOUSLY THE EXPERTS CAN HELP ME LATER. BUT DON'T WE CAN'T WE JUST SAY YOU CAN'T USE THE CONTRACT PHARMACIES LET'S JUST IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN THAT REFER TO BE INSTEAD OF ELIMINATING THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM ALTOGETHER BECAUSE OF THOSE ARE THERE ISSUES I MEAN. IT. I MEAN AGAIN I'M. COMPLETELY JUST TRYING TO. GRAPH THE ISSUE IF I COULD RESPOND TO THAT OUT WE HAVE SEVENTEEN CONTRACT PHARMACIES AND WE HAVE A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. AND THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR TRACKS ALL OF OUR THREE CORE AB MEDICATIONS THROUGH OUR NPI NUMBER AND ALL OF THOSE PHARMACEUTICALS THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED OUT OF ANYONE OF THOSE CONTRACT PHARMACIES ARE RECONCILED MONTHLY. AND ANNUALLY SO THAT'S THAT SYSTEM ALREADY EXISTS AS A PATH FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT AND THE REPORTING TOOL. OKAY UP SO THEN OKAY SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE AND I THINK. WE ALL AGREE THAT. THIS IS A BIG ISSUE THAT CAN'T BE SOLVED. HERE ON. THE OTHER. COMMENT I GUESS IS WE TALK ABOUT THESE SAVINGS BEER BEING REALIZED AND BEING ABLE TO USE THOSE SAVINGS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS BUT BY THE TIME WE REALLY REALIZE THOSE SAVINGS. IF THEY MAGICALLY APPEAR HOWEVER WE PLAN ON APPEARING THEM. IT COULD BE. SAY A YEAR SO WE WOULDN'T BE USING ANY OF THOSE SAVINGS ANY TIME SOON ON TOTAL SAVINGS ARE REALIZED IN THE MEANTIME. COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. I WILL BE IMPACTED BECAUSE SERVICES WON'T BE ABLE TO BE PROVIDED WE CAN AUGMENT THE. MEDICARE MEDICAID WHATEVER. PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE HOPING TO AUGMENT WHAT THE SAVINGS UNTOLD FAIR YEAR MAYBE ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF IN THE MEANTIME I'VE COMMUNITIES THAT. ARE GOING TO BE. HUGELY IMPACTED BY THIS. TRANSITION SO. I I A AGAIN. WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT BY. AT WHAT COST IN THE MEANTIME I THINK THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY'S WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AND THEY DON'T. THERE COMPLICATED I THINK WERE OVER COMPLICATING THEM BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE. THERE'S. FOLKS THAT ARE ALREADY WORKING WITH. ART THERE PROVIDERS OR OR PHARMACIES AND THEN SOMEBODY THAT THAT THIRD PARTY LIKE MANAGEMENT PERSON THAT IS TAKING CARE OF THAT SO IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT COULD BE. A SOLUTION FOR US AS WELL ON. ANYTHING BUT THAT'S JUST MY COMMENTS BY. BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THESE ISSUES. WAYS OF FIXING IT OR NOT FIXING ADD. ELIMINATING IT RIGHT AWAY DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE PREPARED TO ELIMINATE IT RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS POSSIBLE COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN THE HEALTH CENTERS ALL OF THEM. AND THE STATE AND TRYING TO. I FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DO THIS WITHOUT BUT THE LEAST IMPACT. YES ON THE THE. PROVIDERS OF THE SERVICES BUT ULTIMATELY THE FOLKS THERE RECEIVING THEIR CERTAIN THE SERVICES WON'T BE RECEIVING THE SERVICES BECAUSE ALL OF THESE HEALTH CENTERS. ARE BEING IMPACTED SOLD. I CAN GO ON AND WE CAN CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW POINT OF. MY LONG WINDED. I CONVERSATION AS. TO. EXPRESS HOW MUCH MORE WE NEED TO WORK ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T IMPACT. MAINLY FOR ME THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS AS THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT. AND SO I RESPECTFULLY WOULD ASK THAT WE. THE BRAKES ON THAT FOR NOW UNTIL WE CAN. ALL SIT DOWN AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST. SOLUTION WOULD BE. FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED BUT AGAIN FOR ME THE MAIN CONCERN IS THE PUBLIC AND THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT I SERVE THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS. ENOUGH AXES THAT'S IT IS AND THEN IT WOULD THE IMPACT WOULD HAVE WAY LET'S AXES AND SO INSTEAD OF HELPING OR HURTING THEM EVEN IF IT'S. TEMPORARY BECAUSE IT SOUNDS THAT EVEN THOUGH. EVEN IF WE ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW THOUGH SAVINGS WON'T BE REALIZE FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER YEARS ON THE MEANTIME WHAT OF THOSE COMMUNITIES DO. TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW THE CONSERVE THE THE THE POPULATIONS. I WANNA ECHO MANY OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVEALS COMMENTS AND SAY THAT IF WE HAD ANOTHER MEMBER HERE I MIGHT ASK FOR EMOTION AND SOME ACTION TODAY. BECAUSE I FIND WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED FAR TO EXTRACT NOT TIME TOMORROW MORNING FOR YOU WANT TO CALL A SPECIAL MEETING. AS WELL AS DETRIMENTAL TO ACCESS AND WANT TO REITERATE WHAT WAS SAID EARLIER TODAY. THE FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE ELIMINATION IT REQUIRES ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROGRAM INTEGRITY. SO I'D LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT IF I CAN ARE THERE ANY OTHER STATES THAT ARE CONSIDERING THE ELIMINATION. OF THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM. NOT NECESSARILY THE ELIMINATION BUT STATES HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT HOW TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS AN ISSUE I'VE NATIONALLY AND IN PARTICULAR IN MANAGED CARE ELIVERY SYSTEMS. BECAUSE OF THAT. THAT WORK WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND CONTRACT WITH THE PROVIDERS AND SO. THERE'S THIS DISPARITY IN TERMS OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE REPORTED BACK TO THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND BASED UPON. YOU KNOW STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AND AUDIT FINDINGS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL THEY HAVE RECOGNIZED THE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF MANAGING THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR WITH CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS. AND THEY OFFER NO IDENTIFIED SOLUTIONS THAT STATES COULD AT LEAST YOU KNOW SIT DOWN AND HAVE MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. JUST BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE PROGRAM THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THOUGH CAME OUT WITH A VERY DETAILED REPORT. HIGHLIGHTING WHAT OTHER STATES ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO. AND I WONDER WHY WE DON'T LOOK TO THEIR RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS TO REQUIRE CLAIM LEVEL. METHODS AND I'M TRYING TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT EXPLICITLY. WHY ARE WE NOT CONSIDERING THAT PROPOSAL THAT? WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL. CONSIDERATIONS OUT WE DO HAVE A MEETING THAT'S BEING PLANNED WITH EYES SOME OF THE REPRESENTATIVES HERE TODAY REGARDING THE THREE FORTY BE PROPOSAL SO WE DO REMAIN COMMITTED AND TIMES OF WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS. REGARDING THE PROPOSAL THAT IS ON THE TABLE BUT BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AS WHY WE HAVE THE PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE TODAY. IT THUMB WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO WAS SPEAKING IT DOES SEEM THAT THE PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN IS A POTENTIAL MODEL FOR US TO. LOOK AT AS A AN EXAMPLE OF PILOT IF YOU WELL THAT HAS WORKED WELL. ARE THERE ANY PROBLEMS THAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING WITH THAT SPECIFIC HEALTH PLAN AND WHY AREN'T WE CONSIDERING THAT AS A POTENTIAL. PATH FORWARD I MEAN THAT IS ONE OPTION BUT I THINK AGAIN ONE OF THAT THE UNDERLYING ISSUES HERE IS. THAT SAVINGS THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BECAUSE THERE IS A CEILING PRICE FOR THREE FORTY BE DRUGS. WE'VE THE STATE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT CEILING PRICES. WE'LL LEARN ABOUT WHITE THE. ENTITIES WHAT THEY CLAIM TO US WHAT IS REIMBURSED BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CEILING PRICES SO THERE IS A CEILING PRICE OF THREE FORTY BE. THERE'S SOME DIFFERENCE IN BETWEEN THERE AND MOM WE REIMBURSE FOR. MEDICATIONS IN THE PROGRAM WE'RE LOOKING TO REIMBURSE AB WHAT THE DRUG WAS ACQUIRED FOR. SO IF YOU ACQUIRED THE DRUG JUST AS AN EXAMPLE FOR TEN DOLLARS. WE WOULD THEN LOOK TO REIMBURSE YOU WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THREE FORTY BE. AT THAT TEN DOLLARS PLUS THE DISPENSINGFEE NOT SOME NUMBER THAT FROM TEN DOLLARS MAYBE UP TO SAY TWENTY DOLLARS BECAUSE IT'S THAT DIFFERENCE MATT'S BREAD. THAT IS THEM BEING MAINTAINED BY THE THREE FOUR TO BE ENTITIES TO DO THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE BUT. THERE IS NO. FOR TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF HOW THOSE MONIES ARE THEN BE AND UTILIZE WHETHER IT'S FOR THE MEDICAID PROGRAM OR FOR POPULATIONS THAT ARE UNINSURED TODAY. SO THAT THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT. HAS COME TO OUR ATTENTION AND THAT WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED FROM LA OR RECOMMENDATIONS BUT AGAIN WE DO WERE REMAIN COMMITTED. IN TERMS OF SITTING DOWN WITH FOLKS TO TALK THROUGH SOME OPTIONS THAT WE MAY WANT TO RECONSIDER AND MAY LOOK TO PRESENT AT MAY REVISE WHAT DOES THE STATE EXPECT WILL HAPPEN TO THE FQHCS OUR SAFETY NET. HOSPITALS WITHOUT THE THREE FORTY BE PROGRAM. AGAIN WE WOULD BE LOOKING THAT REIMBURSING THEM AT COST FOR FOR PURPOSES OF THAT. DISPENSING OF MEDICATIONS SO WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND A FOR REIMBURSING THEM ACT BECAUSE. THEN WHAT'S THE LOS TO THOSE CLINICS WHAT THE LAW SAYS IS THE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THEM THAT THE SAVINGS THAT THEY GENERATE BECAUSE THEN WE'RE BEING BILLED. AT A HIGHER RATE THEM WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY THEM WHAT THE DRUG WAS ACTUALLY ACQUIRED. THE. I'M STRUGGLING A BIT WITH THAT ANSWER AND DO YOU HAVE TO SHARE THAT SENTIMENT THAT I. BELIEVE THIS WILL BE DETRIMENTAL TO ACCESS AND. AFFECT MANY OF OUR AGE FQHCS THAT. MY COMMUNITY NEEDS AND REALLY. STRUGGLE WITH THAT ANSWER BUT WILL LOOK TURF HAVING FURTHER CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THAT UNDERSTOOD BUT IF IF I CAN. WEEK WE HEARD THAT THE STATE GETS TO KEEP A THIRD OF THE SAVINGS AND WE'RE GIVING BACK TWO THIRDS. I WAS HOPING YOU COULD EXPAND ON THAT A LITTLE BIT TO. EXPLAIN WHY THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOR OUR STATE. THEN WHAT WE HAVE NOW. I MEAN PART OF IT IS WHAT WE'RE WORK HARD TO GET BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NUMBER SHARING IN SAVINGS BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS FINANCE. IN PART WITH FEDERAL DOLLARS SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE FEDERAL SHARING RATIO THAT'S JUST A REQUIREMENT A PARTICIPATING AND ON THE FEDERAL REBATE PROGRAM WE ALSO HAVE A STATE REBATE PROGRAM WHICH IS SEPARATE AND APART. FROM THE THREE FORTY BE BUT THE GOAL OF THREE FORTY BE WISE TO. MAXIMIZE. YOU KNOW IT LOW COST IN TERMS OF PROGRAM OPERATIONS. TO IF WE'RE GIVING A TWO THIRDS OF THE DOLLARS BACK DOES THAT BENEFIT OUR SYSTEM. WELL YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHERE WE ACTUALLY THEN SPENDING FOR THE COST OF THOSE SERVICES BECAUSE NOW RIGHT NOW IT WOULD APPEAR THAT WERE. OVER SPEND. AND I I RECOGNIZE THAT THE CONCERN RAISED BY A PART OF IT IS HOW THE REBATE PROGRAM WORKS BUT THEN IF THERE ARE SAVINGS BECAUSE THERE ARE SAVINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE. BETTER NOT BE INPUT AND FIND THE LEGISLATURE WHAT THEY MAKING THEM DECISION. WHAT? WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE THOSE SAVINGS WOULD BE USED FOR. WHY THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A DECISION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TOTAL WHEN I AM WHO I AM I READING GENERAL FUND THEN BECAUSE I? GUESS BECAUSE WE DO NOT CONTROL THE USE OF THE GENERAL FUND SO I STRUGGLE WHEN. OUR SYSTEMS ARE STRESSED AS THEY ARE TO CONSIDER THAT WERE TAKING. LIMITED HEALTHCARE DOLLARS AND SENDING TWO THIRDS OF THEM. BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN POSSIBLY RE DEDICATING THE OTHER THIRD TOWARDS OTHER SOURCES. THERE WERE ACTUALLY IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE INSTEAD OF. INHIBITING IT IN SOME TRYING TO REALLY GET A SENSE. IF NO OTHER STATES ARE TRYING TO DO THIS IF. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND WE HAVE A POTENTIAL PATH FORWARD WITH A PLAN IN OUR COMMUNITY WIRE WE NOT LOOKING AT THAT. AS OUR PATH FORWARD. RATHER THAN THE ELIMINATION. I THINK AGAIN THAT THAT SOMETHING FOR CONSIDERATION I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE YOU KNOW STATES. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD TO SEE A MASS THEY HAVE OTHER STATES HAVE PUT FOR REQUIREMENTS WHERE THEY DO A LEMONADE. AYE THE USE OF CONTRACT FORMS. SO THERE AS MORE OF A A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP OF WHAT THE PROVIDERS WILL ACTUALLY BELL AND THEN IDENTIFY FOR THOSE SURPLUS. OUT AND WITH THIS IF I CAN BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE MOTHER WHO TESTIFIED SAID IT BEST. SHE SAID TO URGE THE STATE TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE. WITHOUT AFFECTING OUR CENTERS FOR EXCELLENCE. I THINK THAT SAYS IT WELL AND I HOPE THAT DEPARTMENT FINDS AN ABILITY TO. REACH OUT TO THE STAKEHOLDERS AND FIND A SOLUTIONS THAT BEST FOR THE STATE. I JUST WANT ONE OUR LAST QUESTION THERE IS A COMMENT ABOUT. BECAUSE SOME OF THESE CLINICS CAN PARTICIPATE IN THREE FORTY BE THAT THEY HAVE. EITHER A REALLY EXPENSIVE. A ACCESS OR NO ACCESS TO SOME OF THESE DRUGS AND HOW. DO WE ACCOUNT FOR THAT FOR SOME OF THESE FOLKS ARE IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY IS. IF HOW WOULD WE. THE ABLE ACCESS OR SOME OF THESE FOLKS BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE NEEDED. UGH DRUGS IF NOW THEY CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR DRUGS. BUT THREE FORTY BEE IS JUST ONE WAY IN TERMS OF GETTING DRUGS PROVIDED. OTHERWISE THROUGH OUR REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES WE THEN REIMBURSE AT THE COST OF THE DRUG THAT WAS ACQUIRED BY THE ENTITY. THEIR REIMBURSE AT THAT AMOUNT PLUS THE DISPENSING FEE. IT OKAY IF YOU COULD CLARIFY FOR ME BECAUSE I'LL BE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT SO AND THE MODEL THAT RAINY IS REFERRING TO IS IN THAT FEE FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. SO TODAY COVERED ENTITIES DO NOT READ ANYTHING YOU THINGS FROM THREE FORTY BE. IN FEE FOR SERVICE WHICH IS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE MEDI CAL BOOK BUSINESS. THE REMAINING EIGHTY PERCENT THOUGH IS REIMBURSED BASED ON PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS AND HOSPITALS SOMETIMES AS HEALTH PLANS PACKED WITH THE XIN COST FROM THEM THEY PAY MORE SOMETIMES AT LAST THAT'S ALL PART OF THE NEGOTIATION. BUT IF WE CAN NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN THREE FORTY BE FOR THIS MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE BOOK OF BUSINESS. THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL AYE THREE FORTY HOSPITALS PURCHASE THOSE DRUGS AT WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COSTS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL RULES SAY. YOU CANNOT BE PART OF A GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATION IF YOU ARE A THREE FORTY BE COVERED ENTITY. SO YOU KNOW THE BEST WAY I CAN EXPLAIN IT PERHAPS AS. WE CAN EVEN GO TO COST GOING GET THESE DRUGS WE HAVE TO GO TO RITE AID AND GET THEM NOW AND THAT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE DRUG ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GET PAID BY THE DEPARTMENT NOT AT. OUR. ACQUISITION BECAUSE IT STILL PER THAT CONTRACT THAT WE NEGOTIATED WITH THE PLAN SO THE PLAN THIRTY TOLD US WERE PAYING YOU TWENTY DOLLARS FOR THAT DRUG WE DON'T CARE IF YOU BOUGHT IT AT RITE AID FOR FIFTY DOLLARS OR IF YOU BOUGHT IT AT COSTCO FOR FORTY OR ON. THREE FORTY BE FOR TEN. IT DOESN'T MATTER TO US WE'VE NEGOTIATED THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GETTING PAID FOR THAT DRUG SO WE WILL HAVE TO PAY SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IF WE CAN'T BUY THESE JOGGED THREE FORTY BE. AND THAT'S GOING DEBT. AGAIN BE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR HOUSE. THANK YOU AND THE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THE NEXT. STEP WOULD BE BUT I THINK THAT. I THINK OF DOCTOR WOULD EVERYBODY ELSE WAS HERE THAT WE EXPRESS AND I PERSONALLY I WILL THAT THIS REQUIRES WE MORE CONVERSATION AND ELIMINATING THIS. YOU KNOW FROM ONE ONE DAY TO ANOTHER WHICH IN. HOSPITAL TIMES YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS IS ONE DAY TO ANOTHER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAN FOR THE. FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR FOR THE. FUTURE YEARS WE NEED TO HOW CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION IN AGAIN NIGHTS CLEAR THAT THERE'S. ROOM MANY EXPERTS NOT ME. THAT ARE WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT SOLUTION I KNOW THAT THERE WERE SOME. AYE DISCUSSION OVER IN THE SENATE. ABOUT. THE POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES SO IT'S NOT JUST THE ASSEMBLY THAT'S HAVING ISSUES WITH THAT IS THE SENATE ONE MEAN. REALLY GO BOTTOM LINE FOR ME IS THAT ALLOW LOSS OF CARE FOR THE KINGDOM WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES BUT THEN IN THIS CASE. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT REALLY TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT WE CAN NEVER TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE THAT WEEK. THAT SOME POINT TALK ABOUT THE HUMAN FACTOR IN THIS AND YES FELLOW BOTTOM LINE IN THE SPREADSHEETS ARE GUIDED BY THE HUMAN FACTOR IN THIS IS THAT MY COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS I THINK ALL OF CALIFORNIA TO BE QUITE HONEST I DON'T THINK WE'RE UNIQUE DOCTOR ROBILAR AYE YOU NEED TO THE. FACT THAT THERE'S POOR PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THE SERVICES AND SO IF WE CAN ASK THAT THE HUMAN FACTOR BE. AYE LEAST PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AS OPPOSED TO UST THE MONEY FACTOR. ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND ARE LOOKING FOR RESOLUTION BY AT THIS POINT I. REALLY WOULD HOPE THAT WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE THE STAKEHOLDERS. BECAUSE MY STAKEHOLDERS AND MICE DISTRICT CAT COME UP HERE AND DON'T HAVE A SEAT AT THAT TABLE THIS ISN'T THE FEET THAT THEY. HAVE AT THE TABLE IS THROUGH THEIR EYES AND SO. RESPECTFULLY ASK AGAIN THAT WE DON'T DO THIS. RIGHT AWAY I THINK WE CAN TKE LEGISLATIVE ACTION. TO ASK OFFICIALLY YOU BACK WE DON'T DO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEEING AS A SEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION TODAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE MAY REVISE BUT IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS. YOU'RE FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO CATEGORIZE THREE FORTY BE. AYE WANTS TO ENSURE THE NUMBERS WE GET FROM. THE DEPARTMENT ARE ACCURATE. THAT THE REAL. THAT THE SAVINGS CAN BE TRACKED AND SO REALLY WILL BE LOOKING TO YOU TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE IF WE CAN HAVE A PATH FORWARD. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIXTEEN OPEN END OF ON THAT ISSUE SEVENTY SITEMAP OKAY. THANK YOU AND I. ARI TIMES THEIR BROOKS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO THE AGENDA ITSELF DOES COVER AT THE G. HPP BOB BUDGET IN GENERAL. ON THE GENETICALLY HANDICAPPED PERSONS PROGRAM PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE CONDITIONS SUCH AS CYSTIC FIBROSIS HEMOPHILIA SICKLE CELL OR HUNTINGTON'S. PRETTY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE CASELOAD IS A PROCESS APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NINE AT THIS TIME. OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SHOWS FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN COSTS OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. BECAUSE OF SMALL CASELOAD SIZE AND HIGH COSTS OF TREATING THESE CATASTROPHIC CONDITIONS COST CAMPUS FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY AND SO YOU DO SEE THAT IN THE BUDGET ITSELF. AND THERE WAS A REQUEST FOR AT ADDRESSING OF BLOOD CLOTTING FACTORS WILL ADDRESS THAT IN THE NEXT AND THE NEXT TIME AGENDA ITEM IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU ABSOLUTELY. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELIA. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE SEVENTEEN. SEEING NONE WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SEVENTEEN OPEN TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE A TO. WE CAN MAKE. FACE EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS LINDA TAKE AMHERST I GRADUATED WITH A DOCTORATE IN PHARMACY FROM USC IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS I'VE BEEN A CLINICAL PHARMACIST IN FRESNO WORKING WITH HEMOPHILIA PATIENTS. I'M THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY TO EXPLAIN THE POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES. BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROPOSED CHANGE TO MEDI CAL PHARMACY REIMBURSEMENT FOR FLOOD FACTORS. COULD HAVE ON PATIENTS WITH BLEEDING DISORDERS SUCH AS HEMOPHILIA. SPECIALTY PHARMACIES ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF HEMOPHILIA CARE BECAUSE PATIENTS WITH BLEEDING DISORDERS REQUIRE SPECIAL CARE. THE APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT OF HEMOPHILIA IS CRITICAL IN MINIMIZING AND PREVENTING LONG TERM COMPLICATIONS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO HIGHER HEALTHCARE COSTS. HISTORICALLY PATIENTS TREATED BLEEDING EPISODES ON DEMAND. TODAY HOWEVER PROPHYLAXIS TREATMENT HAS GAINED IMPORTANCE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER OUTCOMES. INCLUDING REDUCE JOINT BLEEDS. JOINT REPLACEMENT SURGERIES ARE A COMMON COMPLICATION FROM NOT PROACTIVELY TREATING THE HEMOPHILIA PATIENTS JOINT BLEEDS. BECAUSE OVER TIME THE REPEATED BLEEDING INTO THOSE JOINTS CAN CAUSE SEVERE DAMAGE. AS A RESULT PROACTIVE CARE AND SPECIAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY SPECIALTY PHARMACIES SUCH AS CREATING CARE PLANS ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES AND REDUCE COSTS. AT OUR PHARMACY WE MONITOR PATIENT RESPONSE TO THERAPY BY RECORDING BELIEVES BY TYPE LOCATION AND BECAUSE. AND PROACTIVELY REACH OUT TO THE PATIENT'S HEMOPHILIA TREATMENT CENTER TO ALERT THEM OF ANY PROBLEMS. WE WORK WITH. THE PATIENTS HTC TO DEVELOP TREATMENT PLANS FOR HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR SURGERIES OBSTETRICS DENTAL PROCEDURES EXCEPT FOR. TO MAKE SURE THE PATIENT HAS ADEQUATE PRODUCT AVAILABLE FOR THE GIVEN PROCEDURE. SPECIALTY PHARMACIES IT TREAT BLEEDING DISORDER PATIENTS PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR HOUR ACCESS TO CONSULTATION WITH THE CLINICAL PHARMACIST. THIS ALLOWS PATIENTS TO HAVE A SUPPLY OF FACTORY HOME SO THEY CAN COMPLY WITH THEIR PROPHYLAXIS AND TREAT A BLEEDER EARLY SHOULD OCCUR. THEREBY KEEPING THEM OUT OF THE ER OR HOSPITAL AND PREVENTING COSTLY COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS THE JOINT REPLACEMENT. THE D. H. CS PROPOSED REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY FOR BLOOD FACTORS FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS. WOULD THREATEN BLEEDING DISORDER PATIENT HEALTH AND SAFETY BY LIMITING ACCESS TO CARE. THE NEW REIMBURSEMENT WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS AND WILL NOT BE VERY ATTRACTIVE TO LARGER SPECIALTY PHARMACIES EITHER. IT DOES NOT COVER THE COST OF KEEPING FACTOR IN STOCK OR PROVIDING SERVICES FOR THE PATIENTS. THIS WILL RESULT IN DECREASED PATIENT CHOICE OF PHARMACY AND ACCESS TO CARE. WITHOUT AVAILABLE CLOTTING FACTOR IN SERVICES PATIENTS MAY RESORT BACK TO TREATING ON DEMAND. I'M GOING TO HE OURS FOR THEIR INFUSIONS. HE OURS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO HANDLE A PATIENT WITH A BLEEDING DISORDER. MOST DO NOT STOP CLOTTING FACTOR. AND THE STAFF IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND HOW TO APPROPRIATELY DOES THEM. AS A RESULT OUR PHARMACY HAS BEEN A RESOURCE FOR MOST OF THE E. OURS IN THE FRESNO AREA FOR THIS VERY REASON. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO PREVENT D. H. CS FROM IMPOSING THEIR. OPPOSED BLOOD FACTOR REIMBURSEMENT CUTS TO SPECIALTY PHARMACIES WHO SERVE HEMOPHILIA PATIENTS. THE GOOD DOCTOR HURST. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE EIGHTEEN. DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS TERRY COVER HILL AGAIN FOR THE MONTHLY COUNCIL CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THE FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH HEMOPHILIA AND RELATED BLEEDING DISORDERS. WE HAD HISTORICALLY SUPPORTED THE CURRENT RATE THAT IS ON THE BOOKS AND I THINK ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTACTED THE STATE INSTEAD. THEY NO LONGER WILL BE ALLOWING THAT RATE AND SO THEY DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO COME UP WITH A NEW RATE. THE COUNCIL DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC POSITION ON WHAT THAT RATE SHOULD BE OR LEAVING IT TO THE THREE FORTY BE PHARMACIES IN THE SPECIALTY PHARMACIES BEFORE YOU TO COME UP WITH THAT SOLUTION. WITH THE DEPARTMENT WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND FOR YOU TO BE AWARE THAT THE RATE THAT WAS INITIALLY PROPOSED WE'RE HEARING IS. INADEQUATE THERE ARE A LOT OF ANCILLARY SERVICES THAT GO INTO THE DELIVERY AND DISPENSING OF CLOTTING FACTOR TO THE PATIENTS IN THE HOME SETTING. WE WORKED WITH ON KILEY MITCHELL ON THE STANDARDS BILL IT'S STILL ON THE BOOKS THAT WAS PUT FORTH IN TWENTY TWELVE. SO THERE ARE STANDARDS AROUND THE DISPENSING OF THE STORAGE OF FACTOR SO THAT'S ALL GOOD THAT'S ALL STILL ON THE BOOKS AS I MENTIONED BUT AS FAR AS THE NEW RATE IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO COVER THE SHIPPING SO. IF THERE ARE. THIS THE COSTS RELATED A SHIPPING INCLUDE TRANSPORTATION INCLUDE ICE PACKS IN THAT EXPENSIVE FACTOR SO THAT IT DOESN'T. GET DESTROYED OUT IN THE HEAT IN FRONT OF SOMEONE'S DOORSTEP SO THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT GO INTO THE ANCILLARY COSTS THAT THE SPECIALTY PHARMACIES IN THREE FOUR TO BE PHARMACIES. CAN ARTICULATE BETTER THAN I CAN WE JUST HOPE THAT. YOU KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE DEPARTMENT ARE ALL INVOLVED IN A SOLUTION THANK YOU BECAME. I'M JOHN MARTINEZ FROM FRESNO I HAVE TWO SONS WITH SEVERE HEMOPHILIA DOT WITH MILD HEMOPHILIA. AND WHEN MY SON WAS BORN THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE HOSPITAL WHO COULD EXPLAIN TO US MY WIFE'S PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS SPANISH. THEY COULD TALK WAS EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON SO WE MADE SOME BAD DECISIONS WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION AND MY SON WENT TO A GREAT DEAL OF TRAUMA IN THE HOSPITAL. BECAUSE THE DOCTORS DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND THEY DIDN'T A THE RIGHT TEST AT THE BEGINNING SOME SAY THEY'VE BEEN FIND OUT THAT AND LOOK AT THE PTT LEVELS UNTIL. OUR SEVERAL DAYS LATER WHEN THE FIGURE FINALLY OUT AND IT WAS DURING THAT PROCESS THAT WE SORT OF HAVE TO ADVOCATE FOR OURSELVES% AND LEARN BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL WE WERE ABLE TO GET CONNECTED WITH ESPECIALLY PHARMACIES AND SOME ADVOCATES FROM THOSE. PHARMACIES THAT WERE ABLE TO GIVE US THE INFORMATION CONNECT US WITH THE RIGHT RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN START TO MAKE SOME EDUCATED DECISIONS WITH HIS CARE. AND HE WENT FROM BEING IN A WHEELCHAIR ONCE A MONTH TO PLAYING SPORTS AND BEING BECOME REGULAR CHILD FOR THE MOST PART. AND THAT WAS DUE TO THE ACCESS THAT WE HAD WE ARE I URGE YOU. TO DO I FAIR COMPENSATION PLAN THAT WILL ALLOW THAT TYPE OF ACCESS FOR EVERY PATIENT CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM HONORED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THIS EVENING. I ALSO HAVE AN ADULT BROTHER AND A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD SON WITH HEMOPHILIA. I AM OPPOSED TO THE MEDICAL CUTS THAT WE'RE TRULY THREATENED HEMOPHILIACS TO OUR PATIENTS AND OUR STATE. I'VE GROWN UP AN IMMENSELY A COMMUNITIES THROUGH SOME VERY DIFFICULT TIMES. AND I UNDERSTAND FIRST HAND THE CHALLENGING BUT VITAL ROLE THAT SPECIALLY PHARMACIES PLAY. HAEMOPHILIA SEND A SPECIALLY PHARMACIES ARE VITAL PARTNER IN OUR COMPREHENSIVE CARE. THEIR STAFF HAVE THE LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE NEEDED TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL TIME SENSITIVE AND CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE CARE FOR OUR COMMUNITY. PLEASE KNOW THAT DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF THE MEDICATIONS FACTOR MEDICATIONS ARE NOT ST KEPT IN HOSPITAL PHARMACIES AND AVAILABLE THE EMERGENCY ROOMS GENERALLY. AS A MOTHER I CAN TELL YOU STORY AFTER STORY OF HOW ARE SPECIALLY PHARMACY WAS THE FIRST RESPONDER IN OUR TIMES OF NEED. I CAN SHARE WITH YOU HOW THEY PERSONALLY HAND DELIVERED FACTOR TO THE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM TO TREAT A HADLEY THE COULD HAVE PROVEN THAT AND ACTUALLY HELP PREVENT BRAIN DAMAGE FROM MY SON. I CAN ALSO TELL YOU ABOUT THE FRIDAY NIGHT DELIVERY WHERE THEY MET US AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT TO MAKE SURE WE HAD ENOUGH PRODUCT TO GET THROUGH THE WEEKEND BECAUSE MY SON HAD AN ACTIVE NEW PLEADED THEY KNEW WE WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL DOSES. THEIR EXPERTISE AND SERVICES PROVIDED ARE ESSENTIAL FOR COMPREHENSIVE CARE BUT IT NEEDS TO BE NOTED THAT THEY ALSO DO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE OVERALL LIFETIME CARE NEEDS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEALING WITH THEIR TREATING A PERSON WITH A BLEEDING DISORDER. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CURRENT PROPOSED COST FACTOR REIMBURSEMENT THE CUTS WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR SPECIALLY PHARMACIES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR THIS RARE DISORDER. AND OUR COMMUNITY. AS A MOTHER I ASK YOU TO REJECT THEIR PROPOSED BUDGET CUTS FOR PHARMACY AYE REIMBURSEMENT RATES TO BLOOD CLOTTING FACTORS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. BEGIN. HI MY NAME IS THERE'S CHARMIN I AM A CARRIER FOR SIPPING HEMOPHILIA I HAVE. A THREE YEAR OLD AND A SIX YEAR OLD AND NEPHEWS THAT HAVE SEVERE HEMOPHILIA AS WELL AS MY DAD. AND MY DAD HAS DEVELOPED AN INHIBITOR AS WELL AS MY YOUNGEST NEPHEW. AND WE INFUSE THEN THE HOMIES A SPECIALTY PHARMACY MY YOUNGEST NEPHEW AND MY DAD HAVE TO INFUSE EVERY DAY. AND GO WHICH FROM MY DAD IT TAKES ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR AND IF HE HAS A BLEED IT'S EVERY TWO HOURS. SOMETIMES THAT COULD LAST A COUPLE WEEKS MY NEPHEW HAD TO DO FACTOR EVERY TWO HOURS FOR TWENTY SIX DAYS. I CAN'T EVEN CONCEPTUALIZE WHAT IT WOULD BE TO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT IN YOUR HOME. TO GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM THIS WILL TAKE US BACK TWENTY YEARS AND THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. JUST UNACCEPTABLE. I PLEASE. HOPE THAT YOU. HERE WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY I THINK IT EGGMAN. ARE. MY NAME'S TERRY RICE I'M A PERSON WAS APPEARING APHELIA FACTORY DEFICIENCY I'M AGE FIFTY SIX. PER PERSON TO BE FIFTY SIX WHEN MY SEVERITY OF DISEASE I'M LIKE A UNICORN YOU DON'T SEE ME THAT OFTEN. A MY DEMOGRAPHICS. PEERS OF THE SIXTIES SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES THERE EITHER DECEASED ALSO SEVERELY. DISABLED THAT. THERE ARE AMBULATORY ISSUES ARE DRAMATICALLY IMPACT IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE. I LOOK THROUGH ALL OF THE ADVANCEMENTS OF HEMOPHILIA THERAPIES FROM ESSENTIALLY NOTHING IN THE EARLY SIXTIES. TO THE AMAZING FACT REPLACEMENT THERAPIES THAT WE HAVE TODAY. THAT DUBBED I. DO USE AN ECONOMIC TERM WHEN YOU WERE HAVING A BLEED. AND THE PAIN OF THEM OF A JOINT LEAD YOU CAN'T EVEN I'M ACTION. AND I WENT TWO HUNDRED ZIP UP THEM. AND. WHEN YOU'RE HAVING THAT BLEED LET ME TELL YOU FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT THAT'S. BUT I STUDY. FACTORS SUBSTITUTES FOR EVERYTHING AND NOTHING SUBSTITUTES FOR IT FULL OF THE PAIN RELIEF AND WHAT IT CAN DO FOR YOU. I AT THE. TWENTY YEARS AGO I HAD BOTH OF MY LOOK MY KNEES HAVE BEEN REPLACED MY ANKLES HAVE NO DOOR SUPPLYING AFFLICTION NO CIRCUMFLEX ION IT I'M WALKING ON ESSENTIALLY BONE ON BONE. THAT THE PAIN IS EXTRAORDINARY. I'M JUST STUBBORN. ANY DELAY IT THE CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY THAT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD BY THE EIGHT CS WELL. BY ANYBODY'S ASSESSMENT WILL CURTAIL ACCESS TO CARE. ANY CURTAILMENT TO THE ACCESS TO CARE THAT WE CURRENTLY ENJOY WILL SET US BACK DECADES MY OLD DECADES WITH MY RESULTS. OF EITHER MY PEERS WHICH I'VE EXPLAINED OR MYSELF IN A VERY COMPROMISE QUALITY OF LIFE SITUATION. I'LL GIVE YOU A JUST A QUICK EXAMPLE OF WHAT ANY DELAY ON ONE PLEAD CAN DO PERSONALLY. I WOULD INFER THAT CUT. AT FOUR YEARS OF AGE ON THAT HAND. THEY TRIED ASPIRATED VINI PUNCTURE OF FULL BOTTOM THE SAMPLING CASE I MIGHT NEED A TRANSFUSION IN THAT PROCESS THEY INFILTRATED THE VEINS IN MY LEFT ARM. THE ONE DOCTOR THAT KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM THE PHILLY AT THE TIME WAS ON VACATION FOR THE WEEKEND. BY THE TIME HE GOT BACK FORTY EIGHT HOURS LATER IN THE THERAPY I NEED WHICH WAS A PRECURSOR TO THIS REMARKABLE FACT REPLACING THE RECALL CRY PRECIPITATE BUT IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE. IN AND OF ITSELF. BY THE TIME HE GOT BACK I HAD HATE OPENS CONTRACTURE AYE IT HAD A COMPARTMENT SYNDROME. AND FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS I'VE HAD ESSENTIALLY THIS ARM HANGING. THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE LATE OF ONE BELIEVE. FROM CRIER PRECIPITATE WAS LITERALLY TWO FLOORS ABOVE ME BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GET INTO MY BODY IN A TIMELY BASIS THAT IS WHY IT'S SO CRITICAL. THAT PATIENTS HAVE RENTAL ACCESS TO CARE NO INTERRUPTIONS NO WAY TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING HAVING IT IN THEIR HOME BECAUSE IT IS THE DELAY TO THAT FACTOR GETTING INTO A PERSONAL BLEEDING DISORDER. AT ANY ANY DELAY WHATSOEVER WHICH WILL CAUSE IRREPARABLE PERMANENT DAMAGE THAT WILL. COMPLETELY CHANGED THEIR LIVES AND NOT FOR THE BETTER I URGE YOU TO FIND A BETTER MECHANISM I KNOW THAT THEIR UNDER CONSTRAINTS BY CMS TWO THREE FOUR. AT FTA THAT THE FINAL RULE. BUT THERE ARE OTHER STATES WHO'S MEDICAID PROGRAMS HAVE LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY FOR FACTORY AT FOR A BLEEDING DISORDER THERAPIES AND IT FOUND A BETTER SOLUTION. TO COMPLY WITH BOTH CMS AND THEY'RE REGULATION AND WE DO HAVE A STATE LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA FROM TWO THOUSAND FOUR. THERE IS A BETTER WAY AND MY SUGGESTION IS THAT WE FIND IT BECAUSE THIS CURRENT PROPOSAL WILL DO NOTHING MORE THAN CURTAIL ACCESS TO CARE. AND I AM THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT THAT WILL MEAN. GOOD EVENING I'M DOCTOR AMY ALERS ON AND THE DIRECTOR OF PHARMACY TO SPECIALTY PHARMACY IN TO MY KILL OUT RIGHT CARE FOR HAVE CARED FOR PATIENTS WITH HEMOPHILIA FOR THE PAST ELEVEN YEARS. SPECIALLY PHARMACIST TRAINING BLEEDING DISORDERS PROVIDE THE INDIVIDUALIZED CARE NEEDED TO ALLOW PATIENTS TO FOLLOW THEIR TREATMENT PLANS AND HOW THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF FACTOR ON HAND AT ALL TIMES. BY MINIMIZING THE RELATED COMPLICATIONS UNPLANNED E. R. VISITS AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS PATIENTS HAVE A HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE STATE SAVE HEALTHCARE DOLLARS. THE CONSEQUENCES OF PATIENTS ON HAVING ACCESS TO AN EXPERT SPECIALTY PHARMACY TEAM CAN BE SIGNIFICANT. MY PATIENT IN HIS EARLY FORTIES UNDER ONE HIP REPLACEMENT DUE TO REPEATED UNTREATED BLEEDING EPISODES IN HIS TEENS AND TWENTIES. DEAR COMPLICATIONS OF THE INITIAL PROCEDURE HIT A TOTAL OF THREE HIP SURGERIES IN SIX MONTHS HE WENT FROM INFUSING AS BY FACTOR WEEKLY TO ALMOST DAILY DURING THIS TIME. THIS LACK OF A CONSISTENT QUALIFIED SPECIALTY PHARMACY TEAM. CONTRIBUTED TO NEGATIVE A FAX ON HIS PHYSICAL HEALTH PERSONAL LIFE FAMILY JOB IN FINANCES. THE D. H. C. S. PROPOSED SEVENTY FIVE TO NINETY PERCENT REDUCTION MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR BUD FACTOR PRODUCTS WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MEDI CAL PATIENTS. WITH THE OUTREACH EDUCATION AND PATIENT CARE SERVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY DO. PATIENTS WILL BE FORCED TO UTILIZE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS WHICH ARE NOT EQUIPPED WITH A VARIETY OF LIKE CUTTING FACTORS OR THE TRAINING TO TREAT THESE PATIENTS. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO PROVIDE DEEP SEA ES ROOM POSING THESE DRASTIC CUTS IN BLOOD FACTOR REIMBURSEMENT ESPECIALLY PHARMACIES. TO SERVICE THE THING AFFILIATE PATIENTS THINK YOU'RE WELCOME. STEPHANIE DOWN SCORE AGAIN AS I NOTED I OF AN ADULT SOME WAS SEVERE HEMOPHILIA WITHOUT SUFFICIENT REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR CLOTTING FACTOR. THE AT THIS WILL. AFFECT ACCESS TO LIFESAVING MEDICATION AND TO THE SPECIALTY TREATMENT CENTERS WHO PROVIDE CARE TO THESE COMPLEX PATIENTS. THE MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE BUT ALSO AFFECT CHILDREN WHO ARE COVERED BY CCS AND G. H. PP MANY PATIENTS WITH HEMOPHILIA. CANNOT GET PRIVATE INSURANCE IF THE COST IS PROHIBITIVE. THEY RELY ON CCS NGH PP AS WELL AS MEDI CAL. I KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE CLOTTING FACTOR IS FOR THE STATE BUT THIS METHODOLOGY. COULD ACTUALLY CREATE EVEN A GREATER EXPENSE AS WELL AS HARM TO THE PATIENTS. GAME. HI I'M RYAN REGAL AND I'M A SEVERE FACTORY HEMOPHILIAC NAM ALSO A PATIENT WITH A SPECIALTY PHARMACY HERE IN CALIFORNIA HEARD IN PHARMACY. I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE A. F. A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO PREVENT THE PROPOSED MEDICAL CUTS TO SPECIALTY PHARMACIES FOR OF. BLOOD FACTORS. THE BLEEDING DISORDER COMMUNITY IS VERY SMALL THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND I FEEL ACTS IN AMERICA SO WE ARE A. VERY CLOSE KNIT COMMUNITY AND WE LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AND THE SPECIALTY PHARMACIES THAT I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO HAVE ACCESS TO THROUGHOUT MY LIFE ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THAT COMMUNITY. JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE. THE SPECIALTY PHARMACY THAT I'M A PATIENT OF WAS STARTED BY HEMOPHILIACS FOR HEMOPHILIACS. AND THE UNDERSTAND LIVING WITH HEMOPHILIA IN A WAY THAT NO OTHER ORGANIZATION COULD. UNLESS YOUR HEAD LIKE YOU BELIEVE AS MY MONTHLY ORDER FOR FACT WAS AWAITING AUTHORIZATION. NOT PLACE TO CALL THE HERNDON AND THEY HAD SOMEBODY WITH A BREAK TO THOSE OF FACTOR TELL ME TREAT THAT IF YOU BELIEVE DRIVEN UP TO MY HOUSE AND THEY TURNED AROUND A DROVE RIGHT BACK A SIX HOUR ROUND TRIP JUST MAKE SURE THAT I HAD ACCESS TO. OTHER FACTOR I NEED TO TREAT THAT LEAD. AS HEMOPHILIAC YOU UNDERSTAND DAMAGE THAT CAN BE DONE IF THAT FACTOR IS NOT DELIVERED PROMPTLY. TOUCH WON'T SAY A LIVING WITH HEMOPHILIA IS MUCH LESS OF A BURDEN THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD BE. THANKS TO MEDI CAL G. H. PP AND THE SPECIALTY PHARMACY THAT I RELY ON FOR THESE FACTORED LIVE. DELIVERIES. I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT I HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S DIAGNOSED I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE CONDITION I HAVE HAS MEDICINE AVAILABLE TO TREAT MY DIAGNOSIS. AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT I LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THE MEDICINE IS AVAILABLE TO ME. I I JUST WANNA SAY THAT THE THOUGHT OF NOT HAVING ACCESS TO PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT IS TERRIFYING. I'M I'M A PRODUCTIVE TAXPAYING CITIZEN TODAY BECAUSE OF THE PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENTS I RECEIVED THROUGHOUT MY LIFE. AND TO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT AS A PERSON WITH A BLEEDING DISORDER IS. THAT A CONDEMNATION IT DAVID THE AYE THE IDEA WOULD BE TERRIFYING. WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. HELLO. MY NAME IS SHELLY JUDGE JAY AND I AM THE MOTHER OF TWO SONS ONE OF WHICH HAS SEVERE HEMOPHILIA. I WAS NOT AWARE OVER SECURING AIR INTO MY SON WAS BORN TWENTY THREE YEARS AGO. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAEMOPHILIA WAS BUT ALONE HOW IT WAS GOING TO RAISE A CHILD WITH THIS DISEASE. AFTER COUNTLESS TRIPS TO THE ER FOR INFUSIONS I WAS FORTUNATE TO MEET THE SPECIALTY CARE PHARMACY OWNERS. AT MY FOLLOW UP VISIT AT THE HTC. SHE TOOK THE TIME TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT A SPECIALTY PHARMACY DOES AND HOW THEY COULD HELP ME WITH THE WELL BEING OF MY SON. A SPECIALTY CARE PHARMACY HAS THE HONOR OF COMING INTO PATIENTS HOMES THEIR PLEASURE PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT AND THEIR SOCIAL SURROUNDINGS. THEY GET TO MEET THE FAMILY AND LEARN ABOUT THIS PERSON OUTSIDE OF THEIR DISEASE STATE. THIS FOSTERS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE THAT ENABLES THE SPECIALTY CARE PHARMACY TO ACCESS THE NEEDS OF THE PATIENT AND THEIR FAMILY AND CONNECT THEM TO RESOURCES THAT THEY MAY NOT. HAVE THE AWARENESS OF. HAVING A THOUGHTFUL AND RESOURCEFUL SPECIALTY CARE PHARMACY IN MY SON'S LIFE SINCE THE AGE OF TWO HAS ENABLED HIM TO BE JOINT FREE. NOT ONLY DOES OUR SPECIALTY CARE PHARMACY ENSURE THAT IS FACTOR IS DELIVERED MONTHLY THEY ALSO ENSURE THAT HE IS BEING COMPLIANT WITH HIS INFUSIONS. INFUSING DALY IS NOT SOMETHING ANYONE WANTS TO DO HOWEVER WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR SPECIALTY CARE PHARMACY MY SON STARTED SELF INFUSING AT AGE SIX. WITHOUT OUR SPECIALTY CARE PHARMACY EDUCATING US ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF TREATMENT DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AVAILABLE RESOURCES WE WERE UNAWARE OF. MY SON WHO IS NOW TWENTY THREE MAY NOT HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE THE SIX FIVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS YOUNG MAN HE IS TODAY. I DID NOT HAVE A CHOICE WHEN I GIVE THE HIM AFFILIATED JEAN TO MY SON BUT I DO HAVE A CHOICE ON CHOOSING A SPECIALTY CARE PHARMACY. I BEG YOU PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS AWAY FROM US AND ANY OTHER FAMILY THAT CHOOSES TO USE OUR SPECIALTY CARE PHARMACY. FAMILY IS NOT ABOUT BLOOD IT'S ABOUT WHO IS WILLING TO HOLD YOUR HAND WHEN YOU NEED IT THE MOST AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT A SPECIAL PETER. SPECIALTY CARE PHARMACY DOES THANK YOU BECAME.

HELLO AGAIN MY NAME'S MATCHING TRILLIUM FROM THE CENTER FOR INHERITED BLOOD DISORDERS WE ARE THE LARGEST HEMOPHILIA TREATMENT CENTER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ONE THING YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS THAT WE LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OUR CLINICAL CARE EACH YEAR. AND IT'S WE MAKE UP FOR IT BY OUR THREE FORTY BE PHARMACY PROGRAM. REPORTS THAT CARE. SO WE'RE JUST ASK HERE ON BEHALF. OF ALL THE HIM FISHING IN CENTERS JUST TO COME UP WITH MODEL THAT WORKS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROPERLY COMPENSATED FOR ALL THE CARE THAT WE DO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD EVENING COME MY NAME IS CRAIG MAYOR SAM WITHOUT HAVE OCCASION FOR ACCESS SPECIALLY PHARMACY COALITION AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR STAYING IN THIS LATE HOME. GIVEN US ACCESS AND HEARING OUR VOICES. SO SPECIALLY PHARMACIES DO IS DO THE SAME THING AND THEY PROVIDE ACCESS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS OF THE YEAR. THEY PROVIDE THAT HUMAN FACTOR. OF MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN PATIENTS LIVES. THERE'D THERE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT IF YOU AS YOU'VE HEARD. HELPING A PATIENT ACCESS THEIR PRODUCT THEY'RE THERE WHEN A CHILD WAKES UP IN THE MORNING IN NEEDS THE PRODUCT BEFORE THEY GO TO SCHOOL. SO THEY CAN BE AT SCHOOL AND PLAY WITH THEIR FRIENDS AT SCHOOL. THEY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN PATIENTS LIVES EACH AND EVERYDAY. WE'VE ASKED FOR A COUPLE OF THINGS ARE PROPOSAL IS BUDGET NEUTRAL ACTUALLY THE METHODOLOGY ROUTE WE'VE PROPOSED. WILL SAVE THE STATE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS FROM THE CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY THAT EXISTS TODAY. ARE ALSO ASKING FOR OVERSIGHT WE'VE MET WITH THE DEPARTMENT. I WE'VE HAD SOME STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WE PROVIDED DATA THAT THEY REQUESTED AND ALL THAT COMMUNICATIONS STOPPED AFTER WE PROVIDED THAT DATA. SO WE HAVE A REALLY WE DIDN'T HAVE A STAKEHOLDER MEETING WERE SUPPOSED TO IN JANUARY. AND SO EVERYONE IS REALLY. ANXIOUS. CONCERNED. THE THIRD THING I'D LIKE TO ASK IS IS THAT THERE BE A SAFETY STUDY DONE. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO SEE IF THIS IS IMPLEMENTED A PATIENT ACTUALLY DIE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CLIENT FACTOR. LIKE THEY DO TODAY AND A SIMPLE SAFETY STUDY MAY BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR AND WELCOME TO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. I'D LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE SEVERAL. SUBCOMMITTEE QUESTIONS AND ARE WONDERING IF YOU CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE. YES THANK YOU I'M. IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSAL I I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT THE A PROPOSED CHANGE. I THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD PUT OUT AND DATING GAUGE WHAT STAKEHOLDERS WAS AS A RESULT OF AS WAS MENTIONED WHAT THE FIRST ON PUBLIC COMMENT. AS A RESULT OF A FEDERAL RULE THAT CAME OUT WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES IN OUR DRUG REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES SO BLOOD CLOTTING FACTOR IS ONE. WE DID PUT OUT JUST THAT A PROPOSAL WE HAVE BEEN AYE TAKING BACK. THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED TO DATE AND THAT'S WHY FOLKS HAVE NOT YET HEARD BACK FROM US IS BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING THOSE UNDER CONSIDERATION. AND TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO US SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WERE AWARE THAT. THE PROPOSAL WAS SOMETHING THAT WE WANTED TO HAVE ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON AND IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE COME OUT AND SAID YES THIS IS IN FACT WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE ARE REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO COME UP WITH A REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY AND BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING. IS TECH BREAKING APART ARM THAT REIMBURSEMENT UP THE DRUG ITSELF AND THEN ALSO DOING. A BETTER JOB OF DELINEATING WHAT THOSE CANCEL LARRY SERVICES ARE BECAUSE TODAY THE WAY THAT THEY'RE REIMBURSED. IS BASED UPON AVERAGE SALES PRICE OF THE DRUG PLUS TWENTY PERCENT. SO IT'S TWENTY PERCENT OF THAT DRUG PRICE AND SO WHAT SEE A MASSIVE SAYING. THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE OVERPAYING FOR CLOTTING FACTOR WE HAVE TO DO IS COME UP WITH THE METHODOLOGY THEY HAVE NOT DICTATED WHAT THAT METHODOLOGY SHOULD LOOK LIKE. BUT IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT MEETS THEIR REQUIREMENTS AND THAT WE HAVE TO PUT IN FRONT OF THEM WE DON'T HAVE A TIMELINE HOWEVER WHEN THEY DID APPROVE OUR STATE PLAN AMENDMENT. FOR OUTPATIENT COVER DRUGS BY A PHARMACY PROVIDERS. THEY DID INDICATE IN THAT LETTER THAT THEY WERE EXPECTING TO SEE SOMETHING FROM US IN THE THIRD QUARTER. OF THIS YEAR BUT WE HAVE ALREADY INDICATED TO THEM WE WILL NOT HAVE SOMETHING TO PUT BEFORE THEM AND THAT WE ARE JUST WORK PART TO THEM REPORT BACK TO THEM IN TERMS OF THE STATUS. OF WHERE WE'RE AT AND MAKING A PROPOSAL FOR MAKING CHANGES TO OUR PLANT PUTTING OUR REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY. I'M SAYING THAT THERE'S NO SPECIFIC DEADLINE WHAT OTHER OPPORTUNITY WILL WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAVE TO. PROVIDE INPUT. AND WHY I BRING IT UP IS I WAS ON THE RECEIVING END OF. MANY OF THE HEMOPHILIACS WHO WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS. TIMELY. MEDICATIONS AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A COST TO OUR STATE. WHEN WE ARE NOT PROVIDING. THE APPROPRIATE CARE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. AND SO. WILL WE HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO. PROVIDE INPUT OR TWO. AS AN ADVOCATE FOR THE SPECIALTY PHARMACIES THAT DO PROVIDE A NEEDED SERVICE FOR COMMUNITIES. HE YES THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT INPUT TODAY WE DO HAVE STATE STATUTE. THAT TALKS ABOUT AND THIS WAS ALSO MENTION. THE EXISTING STATUTE TODAY SAYS WE SHALL NOT PAY MORE THAN A S. P. PLUS TWENTY PERCENT THAT'S KIND OF LIKE OUR FRAMEWORK THAT WERE WORKING WITHIN. IT COULD BE SOMETHING GLASS FAN HOW MUCH LESS THAN WE DO NOT HAVE THOSE DECISIONS MADE AS OF YET. SO THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC PROCESS WE WELCOME. AND THE ENGAGEMENT AND THE INTERACTION WITH BOTH THE STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS WHAT THE LEGISLATURE WELL I HOPE YOU WILL WORK WITH OUR SUBCOMMITTEE I'M ENGAGED ON THIS ISSUE.
