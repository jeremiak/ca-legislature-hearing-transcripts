PATH TO MAKING DECISION ON THIS.

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:59.785
AND YOU HAVE IN ESSENTIALLY A

00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:00.318
MONOPOLY.

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:01.219
AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE A

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:01.987
TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF FAMILIES

00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:03.388

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:04.222
AUTISM.

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:06.224
AND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:07.993
THOSE FAMILIES ARE FINDING THAT

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.828
THE ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT.

00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:13.031
IS EFFECTIVE IF THEY DIDN'T.

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:15.067
TAKE THE FIRST TREATMENT WASN'T

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:15.834
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE

00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:16.868
SECOND TREATMENT.

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:19.171

00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:21.440
AN ARBITER IN THIS CONVERSATION

BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A

00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:24.309
MONOPOLY YOU'RE GONNA SAY WERE

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:25.544
BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:26.878
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A MONOPOLY.

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:27.913
IS WERE IN POWER IN THE

00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:31.717

PHYSICIAN THINKS THAT CHILD IS

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:50.469
GOING TO BENEFIT FROM FOR TIME.

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:51.770
THAT THE INSURER SHOULD COVER IT

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:52.838
AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S

00:22:52.904 --> 00:22:55.607
OPPOSITION BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:22:55.674 --> 00:22:56.608

00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:45.543
MIX BETWEEN THE TWO INTERESTED

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:46.978
IN BOTH OF THE THEORIES IN TERMS

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:48.680
OF HOW IT WORKS.

00:25:48.747 --> 00:25:51.449
I APPRECIATE THAT -- DIE A TO

00:25:51.516 --> 00:25:53.051
THE IN A CENTER PORTANTINO I AND

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:54.152
I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:55.353
THEIR TO ME BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.788
BASED MEDICINE IS SOMETHING

00:25:56.855 --> 00:25:58.957
THAT'S BEEN PART OF MY CAREER --

00:25:59.024 --> 00:26:00.759
THE I HAVE A BACKGROUND IN.

00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:02.761
PUBLIC HEALTH IN THIS INTO MY

00:26:02.827 --> 00:26:04.396
MASTERS PUBLIC HEALTH IS ON

00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:08.199
FOCUSED ON ON CLINICAL QUALITY

00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:10.535
IMPROVEMENT SO EVIDENCE BASED

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:12.370
APPROACHES OR SOMETHING THAT IS

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:13.905
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME.

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:15.240
I THINK I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING

00:26:15.307 --> 00:26:17.375
AMENDED BECAUSE THE DEFINITIONS --

00:26:17.442 --> 00:26:18.910
CAN BE A LITTLE CHALLENGING AND

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:20.412
ACTUALLY I WANT TO BE SURE WE

00:26:20.478 --> 00:26:22.113
DIDN'T PUT A DEFINITION CODE

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.848
THAT WASN'T BUT THE SAME TIME I

00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:25.617
ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A

00:26:25.684 --> 00:26:29.454
LOT OF THINGS WE DO IN MEDICINE.

00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:31.756
THAT WE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE DOING

00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:33.792
BIG STUDIES IS EXPENSIVE SO BIG

00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:35.460
STUDIES HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN DONE

00:26:35.527 --> 00:26:37.295
I MEAN WE LOOK AT NEONATOLOGY

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:38.296
I'M PEDIATRICIAN.

00:26:38.363 --> 00:26:39.965
WHAT OF THOSE STUDIES ARE VERY

00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:42.600
IS -- THE UPDATE INVOLVED TO

00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:43.635
TWENTY PATIENTS OR TWELVE

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:44.869
PATIENTS OR SOMETHING AND DEAL

00:26:44.936 --> 00:26:46.237
WE WE DON'T WANT WHAT WE CALL

00:26:46.304 --> 00:26:48.039
EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE -- SO

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:49.908
THAT SOUNDS EXAMINE EXPERT BUT

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:51.276
SAME TIME WE ALSO TO TAKE THE

00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:52.978
THE DATA THAT WE HAVE AN

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:54.045
EXISTENCE AS A WILL WHICH

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:54.846
DIRECTION IS A LOOK LIKE NOW

00:26:54.913 --> 00:26:56.414
SOMETIMES IT'S WRONG AND WE HAVE

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:57.949
TO CHANGE DIRECTION.

00:26:58.016 --> 00:26:59.250
BUT WE CAN'T SAY WELL IF WE

00:26:59.317 --> 00:27:00.719
SOMEONE DIDN'T DO A BIG STUDY WE

00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:02.053
DON'T DO ANYTHING AND WE'RE NOT%

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.122
GOING TO PROVIDE CARE RIGHT WE

00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:05.690
HAVE A PATIENT WHO NEEDS HELP.

00:27:05.757 --> 00:27:07.292
AND SO THEY NEED TO GET CARE AND

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:09.294
THAT'S SO I THINK IF WE IT IS

00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:10.729
NOT A CASE WHERE A PHYSICIAN IS

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:13.031
WILLFULLY -- JUST TRYING TO AND

00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:14.432
HAS A CONFLICT AND THEY'RE

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:15.567
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT

00:27:15.633 --> 00:27:16.901
THERE'D YOU EXERCISING THE BEST

00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:18.436
CLINICAL JUDGMENT BECAUSE THAT'S

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:19.704
WHAT WE NEED TO THERE ISN'T

00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:21.506
RESEARCH ON EVERY SINGLE ASPECT

00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:22.607
OF CARE.

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:23.842
THEY'RE USING THE BEST CLINICAL

00:27:23.908 --> 00:27:30.548
JUDGMENT USING THE BEST

00:27:30.615 --> 00:27:32.050
AVAILABLE EVIDENCE.

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:32.884
I THINK WE HAD AN IDEAL THAT WE

00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:33.551
COULD TALK ABOUT MEDICAL

00:27:33.618 --> 00:27:34.152
NECESSITY DEFINITIONS AND ALL

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:34.753
THAT WE'LL GET INTO THAT BUT I

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:35.387
MEAN I'VE FUNDAMENTALLY I DON'T

00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:36.354
SEE HOW WE CAN'T SAY THAT WELL

00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:38.089
WE NEED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:38.289
THAT.

00:27:38.356 --> 00:27:41.026
AND AND I THINK WHAT YOU HEAR IS

00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:41.726
THAT YOU HAVE A BEHAVIOR

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:42.994
DEVELOPMENTAL TOO SO IT'S NOT

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:43.762
LIKE SOMEONE.

00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:46.331
YOU KNOW JUST GOT ANY FOUND THE

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:46.931
DOCTOR TO TELL THEM WHAT THEY

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:48.366
WANT TO HEAR DAVE STATE THAT

00:27:48.433 --> 00:27:49.434
THEIR OWN BE GIVEN DEVELOP THE

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.102
FUTURE IS A SPECIALIST IN THE

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.636
FIELD SAID.

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:52.937
YOU KNOW WHAT BASED ON

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:54.439
EVERYTHING I SEE WITH YOUR CHILD

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:55.840
IN MY KNOWLEDGE THIS IS

00:27:55.907 --> 00:28:00.278
SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY BENEFITS.

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:01.780
SIGNIFICANTLY.

00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:02.580
I FIND IT HARD TO SAY WELL GUESS

00:28:02.647 --> 00:28:03.748
WHAT WE'VE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:04.816
ARTISAN BENEFIT BUT WE'RE NOT

00:28:04.883 --> 00:28:06.151
GOING TO COVER THAT.

00:28:06.217 --> 00:28:07.218
I MEAN THIS IS NOT SOMEONE WHO

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:08.620
HASN'T BEEN EVALUATED FAIRLY

00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:12.390
THOROUGHLY AND AND SO -- SO I AM

00:28:12.457 --> 00:28:14.359

00:28:15.693 --> 00:28:17.062
WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO PUT ALL

00:28:17.128 --> 00:28:18.129
THESE DIFFERENT PIECES TOGETHER

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:19.898
BUT AND ADMIT I TRAINING

00:28:19.964 --> 00:28:21.366
BEHAVIOR DEVELOPMENTS -- NOT

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:23.701
FORMAL BE INDIE DR BUT I I DO I

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:27.338
DO THINK THAT -- WE WE NEED --

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:32.644
TO THAT -- THAT WE WE NEED TO

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.546
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW.

00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:35.814
TO HOW. TO TO TO TO MEET THE

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.347
NEEDS OF THESE FAMILIES

00:28:36.414 --> 00:28:37.248
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE --

00:28:37.315 --> 00:28:39.384

BIGGER STUDIES BUT I AND I AM

00:28:45.123 --> 00:28:46.424

AS A WOMAN AND AS A LEGISLATOR

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:43.147

STUDENT RIGHT TO ACCESS ACT.

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.372
THE FIRST LOOKED AT HOW OFTEN

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.441
STUDENTS SEEK ABORTION CARE AND

00:43:30.507 --> 00:43:31.041
WHETHER THEY FACE SIGNIFICANT

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:31.942
BARRIERS.

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:33.844
STUDENTS ACROSS THE THIRTY FOUR

00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:41.118
WE ESTIMATE THAT AS MANY AS

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:43.387
THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO TO

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:44.021

MONTHLY ON CAMPUSES.

00:43:47.024 --> 00:43:48.926
IF STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:49.693
OFFERED THE SERVICE.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.261

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:52.796
PUBLIC UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:54.198
CONSIDERING THAT THE SERVICE

00:43:54.264 --> 00:43:56.200
REQUIRES TWO VISITS THE MEDIAN

00:43:56.266 --> 00:43:58.002

AND UP TO FOUR HOURS FOR

GIVEN THESE FINDINGS I BELIEVE

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:23.427
THAT ABORTION KAREN CAMPUS IS

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:26.163
NECESSARY TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:27.898
DECREASED BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS.

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:29.366
FOR THE SECOND STUDY WE STUDY

00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:30.734

IF IF IF YOU'RE A WHOLE ARGUMENT

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:20.849
IS [inaudible]

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:22.017
GEOGRAPHY.

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:25.821
YOU FOLLOW ME.

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:26.822
YES MA'AM MY VOLUME ALL RIGHT.

01:15:26.889 --> 01:15:29.391
I WOULD SAY THAT.

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:30.692
AND THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:32.527
LEAVE TO PEOPLE THAT ARE MARKS

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:33.595
HAS MUCH MORE EXPERTISE HAN

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:35.163
PASSING LEGISLATION BUT IT SEEMS

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:36.164
TO ME THAT.

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:38.500
IT'S VERY RISKY TERRITORY TO

01:15:38.567 --> 01:15:40.435
PASS LEGISLATION ON POTENTIAL

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:42.104
FUTURE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE NOT

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:43.105
OCCURRED.

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:44.373
AND SO WHETHER IT'S ABOUT

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:47.843
ABORTION OR ANYTHING ELSE REALLY.

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.645
IF THE IDEA OF THE ARGUMENT AND

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:50.045
CORRECT ME IF I'M

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:51.713
MISUNDERSTANDING YOU BUT IF THE

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:54.750
ARGUMENT IS THAT WE SHOULD MAKE

01:15:54.816 --> 01:15:56.785
SURE OUR UNIVERSITIES PROVIDE

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:58.987
ABORTIONS IN CASE ABORTION

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:00.522
CLINICS ALREADY EXISTS THESE.

01:16:00.589 --> 01:16:01.490
TWO THAT I THINK THAT GOES WELL

01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:02.891
BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:04.092
ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS BILL HAS

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:05.127
FOCUSED VERY.

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:06.795
CLEARLY AND CAREFULLY ON HOW WE

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:08.897
ARE NOT PROVIDING SURGICAL

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:10.632
ABORTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WHICH PART

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:11.700
OF MY ARGUMENT WAS THAT WOULD

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:13.802
MAKE MORE SENSE IN TERMS OF

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:15.671
SAVING STUDENTS TIME.

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:18.073
AND I THINK THAT.

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.943
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ANSWER.

01:16:21.009 --> 01:16:21.677
I THINK IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:23.478
ANSWER FOR IT FOR THE KIND OF

01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:24.913
SPECULATION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:25.180
I GUESS.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:26.214
IF IT WERE ME.

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:28.116
I WOULD LOOK AT ALL THE

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:28.850
PROVIDERS NOT JUST BECAUSE WE

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:30.118
KNOW PLAN PARA HAS NOT THE ONLY

01:16:30.185 --> 01:16:31.753
ABORTION PROVIDER I'M READING

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:32.821
FROM YOUR CHART AND SO YOUR

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:33.855
CHART LISTS.

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:35.324
THE WHOLE COLUMN WITH PLANNED

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:36.558
PARENTHOOD PROVIDERS.

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.393
ALL WHO ARE WITHIN SIX MILES YES

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.362
MA'AM I AGREE BUT I'M SAYING IF

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:40.996
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:42.230
HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION THAT I

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:44.766
WOULD LOOK AT WHAT LEGISLATION

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:46.168
YOU THINK IS GOING TO PREVENT

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:47.669
PLANNED PARENTHOOD PREVENTING

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:48.904
ABORTION PROVIDING ABORTION.

01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:50.238
IF IT APPLIES TO ALL THE CLINICS

01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:51.573
WERE TALKING ABOUT AND UNDER

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.774
THAT LANDSCAPE WHAT IT WOULD

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:53.642
MEAN FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:55.310
RIGHT TO ABORTION ON COLLEGE

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:56.211
CAMPUSES.

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.313
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT HAS MUCH

01:16:58.380 --> 01:16:59.314
TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:16:59.381 --> 01:17:02.784
ABOUT TODAY BECAUSE THAT HAS NOT.

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:03.852
OCCURRED IN TO MY KNOWLEDGE IN

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:04.686
CALIFORNIA IS UNLIKELY.

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:07.389
TO SO.

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:08.457
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT.

01:17:08.523 --> 01:17:10.359
SO I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:12.928
I WOULD HAVE.

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:13.729
TO I WOULD HAVE TO SEE THAT

01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:15.831
SITUATION AND AND THEN CONSIDER

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:16.932
THE ARGUMENT.

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:21.870
I I APPRECIATE THAT AND I ONLY

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:23.205
RAISED IT BECAUSE I'M READING

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:24.806
THE CHART THAT WAS PROVIDED TO

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:26.308
ME BY THE OPPOSITION.

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:29.344
THAT AN ARBITRARY NOTION THAT

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:31.313
SIX MILES WAS DEEMED ACCEPTABLE

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.382
I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT OF

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:35.384
THE BILL THAT IS BEFORE US.

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.285
IS THAT IT SHOULD BE A SERVICE

01:17:37.352 --> 01:17:39.488
AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS ON THEIR

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:42.391
CAMPUS -- I APPRECIATE THE

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:44.192
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION --

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:45.394
OPINED [inaudible]

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.596
THAT.

01:17:47.662 --> 01:17:50.065
CLINICS WORK CLOSE ENOUGH AND

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:51.800
THE POINT I'M RAISING IS I THINK

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:57.339
IT IS A VERY -- TROUBLING BUT

01:17:57.406 --> 01:18:00.275
POTENTIAL LIKELIHOOD -- BASED ON

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:04.613
THE CURRENT -- CONSISTENT ACTION

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:06.415
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:08.984
THESE CLNICS WOULD NOT BE ABLE

01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:10.886
TO PROVIDE THESERVICES THAT

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.721
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:14.389
THAT HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:16.124
ATTACK IN MESSAGE FROM THE

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.493
ADMINISTRATION WE ARE CURRENTLY

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.496
FIGHTING A TITLE TEN GAG ORDER

01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:23.698
AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:25.333
PERSPECTIVE THAT CALIFORNIA

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.502
WOULD BE THAT THAT CATEGORY.

01:18:27.569 --> 01:18:29.938
I HOPE TO SHARE YOUR OPTIMISM

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:31.273
BUT I'M VERY CONCERNED.

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:32.641
BUT I JUST THINK IF THAT'S THE

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:34.242
ARGUMENT YOU'RE GONNA RAISE THAT

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:35.777
WE NEED TO HAVE BE REALLY CLEAR

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:38.647
ABOUT WHAT IS ON THE TABLE AND

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:39.881
WE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION ON A

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:41.349
REGULAR BASIS INCLUDING THE

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:42.384
BUDGET.

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:44.986
IN TERMS OF OUR EXPECTATIONS

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:47.622
ABOUT PROSPECTIVE ACTIONS WE DO

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:49.491
IT ALL THE TIME SO THAT.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:52.060
CLEARLY WITHIN OUR LANE.

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:53.395
IT WAS -- IS OKAY IF I RESPOND

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.397
WITH THE ONLY IF YOU HAVE TO

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:56.765
CHECK DO WE SHOULD RESPOND YES

01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:57.299
THANK YOU A YES PLEASE.

01:18:57.365 --> 01:18:58.700
THE ONLY OTHER THOUGHT I HAD IS

01:18:58.767 --> 01:19:00.402
THAT IT'S NOT I THINK IT'S

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:02.070
INHERENTLY AND IN THE I'M GOING

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:02.971
TO BE.

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:04.272
A MATTER OF OPINION DECIDING

01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:05.674
WHAT IS OR IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.042
DISTANCE AND I AGREE UP FOR

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.743
DEBATE I AGREE BUT I DON'T THINK

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:10.378
THE ARGUMENT IS SOLELY WHAT IS

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:11.880
AN ACCEPTABLE DISTANCE THIS

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:12.581
ISN'T.

01:19:12.647 --> 01:19:14.116
A SITUATION OF INFINITE TIME AND

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:17.752
RESOURCES AND I THINK PART OF

01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:18.320
THE ARGUMENT AND THIS HAS.

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:18.954
THIS IS NOT SPEAKING TO PRO LIFE

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.222
OR PRO CHOICE AT ALL IN MY

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:21.356
OPINION IT'S SIMPLY.

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.358
WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRE THE

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:24.860
UNIVERSITIES TO TAKE ON

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.261
SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVEN'T

01:19:26.328 --> 01:19:27.295
ELECTED TO TRY TO DO ON THEIR

01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:27.729
OWN.

01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:29.831
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:31.900
IT'S GOING TO COST SOME NON ZERO

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.368
AMOUNT VERY LARGE NON ZERO

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:34.202
AMOUNT.

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:37.038
OF TRAINING IN EXPENSES AND

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:38.573
RESOURCES AND THEN.

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.242
THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE OF

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:42.277
CONSIDERATIONS OF FOR EXAMPLE IF

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.979
LET'S SAY THE NEAREST ABORTION

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:45.013
CLINIC WAS.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.749
ON AVERAGE THIRTY MILES AWAY

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:49.084
THEN WE MIGHT START TO BE MORE

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:50.685
LIKE WELL THAT'S THAT'S VERY

01:19:50.752 --> 01:19:51.753
STRONGLY IN THE ARGUMENT THAT

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:52.888
YOU'RE MAKING OR IF IT WAS ON

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.222
AVERAGE A BLOCK AWAY THEN IT

01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:55.023
WOULD SEEM.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.491
LESS COMPELLING SO I THINK IT

01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:57.859
DOES MATTER TO LOOK AT AVERAGE

01:19:57.926 --> 01:19:59.327
DISTANCE AND LOOK AT WHAT THE

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:00.695
BILL IS GOING TO COST WHAT

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:01.863
LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT OPEN THE

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:03.932
UNIVERSITIES UP TO OR NOT IT'S

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:04.933
WORTH DISCUSSING.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.268
BUT IT'S NOT SIMPLY ONE SIDE OF

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:08.870
THE EQUATION BECAUSE IF THIS WAS

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:09.671
SOLELY ABOUT.

01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:10.372
THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO

01:20:10.438 --> 01:20:13.041
ABORTION NO MATTER WHAT THE COST

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:14.709
THEM I AGREE THE RENO POINT

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:16.711
LOOKING AT THE GEOGRAPHY IF THAT

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:17.445
MAKES SENSE BUT IT IS ALWAYS

01:20:17.512 --> 01:20:17.913
GOING.

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.514
TO WELL YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:20.282
GOING TO BE A BALANCE OF

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:21.816
RESOURCES AND RIGHT THAT WAS

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:25.053
PART OF THE I THINK THAT WAS THE

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:25.921
PART OF THE THOUGHT PROCESS WHEN

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:26.922
IT WAS VETOED.

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:28.423
I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND THIS

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:29.891
IS THE POLICY COMMITTEE THE

01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:31.526
RESOURCE CONVERSATION TAKES

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:32.160
PLACE IN APPROPRIATIONS

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:33.895
COMMITTEE SO I'M REALLY FOCUS ON

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:35.931
THE INTEGRITY OF THE POLICY

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.032
ITSELF.

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:38.466
ANOTHER WITNESS WANTED TO

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:40.435
RESPOND TO MY POINTS TO THE

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:41.436
CHAIR IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:43.338
MISTER CHAIR THANK PLEASE.

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:46.508
DISTANCE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:48.043
THE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IS

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:50.612
THIS BILL IS ABOUT ACCESS.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.714
AND ACCESS TO MY RATES AND IN

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:54.382
THAT THREE MONTH PERIOD THAT I

01:20:54.449 --> 01:20:56.151
DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO MARS I

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:57.986
HAD NO RIGHTS ESSENTIALLY SAID

01:20:58.053 --> 01:20:59.487
THIS IT IS ABOUT ACCESS.

01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:00.822
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S SIX

01:21:00.889 --> 01:21:03.124
MILES TEN MILES THIRTY MILES IT

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:04.559
SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE

01:21:04.626 --> 01:21:06.661
NO MATTER THE DISTANCE AND MAKE

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:07.562
IT CLOSER AND MAKE IT MORE

01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:09.164
CENTRAL TO OUR STUDENTS LIVES

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:11.833

THE PROPONENTS CLAIM THAT.

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:02.017
ABORTION MEDICATION TECHNIQUES

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:03.351
ARE EXTREMELY.

01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:04.953
SAFE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND COST

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.388
EFFECTIVE.

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:07.856
AND MAYBE FOR MOST WOMEN THAT'S

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:09.190
TRUE.

01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:10.625
BUT FOR MANY THIS IS NOT THE

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:11.626
CASE.

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.194
STUDENT HEALTH CARE CENTERS ARE

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:15.730
GENERALLY NOT EQUIPPED. TO

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:17.098
HANDLE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES A

01:22:17.165 --> 01:22:19.534
COME WITH THE ADVERSE REACTIONS

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:22.270
THE COME FROM ABORTION PILLS.

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:23.471
SINCE MY FIRST PAYMENT METHOD

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:25.507
PRESS STONE WAS APPROVED IN TWO

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:27.242
THOUSAND BY THE FDA AS WAS

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:28.209
MENTIONED.

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.944
THERE'S BEEN MORE THAN FOUR

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:31.379
THOUSAND CASES WERE SEVERE

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:33.214
REACTIONS OF A CLEARED INCLUDING

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:34.582
A THOUSAND WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:35.917
HOSPITALIZED.

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:37.752
AND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT

01:22:37.819 --> 01:22:38.687
WOMEN THAT IF NEEDED BLOOD

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:40.922
TRANSFUSIONS BECAUSE OF PROFUSE

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:41.756
BLEEDING.

01:22:41.823 --> 01:22:43.158
AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE HAVE

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:46.194
BEEN TWENTY TWO DEATHS.

01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:48.229
DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE.

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:49.898
TO THE MEDICAL PROCEDURE.

01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:51.199
THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:53.468
MEDICINE IN NINETEEN NINETY

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:54.869
EIGHT CONCLUDED THAT ONE OUT OF

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:56.838
SIX CASES.

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:58.573
THE TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.342
WHEN THE MEDICATION IS TAKEN.

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:02.243
IS IN COMPLETE.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:03.278
SO WHEN THE ABORTION PILL

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:06.214
DOESN'T WORK THE FIRST TIME.

01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:07.549
A LOT OF TIME WE WERE WE'VE

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:08.717
HEARD ABOUT THAT THERE'S IS LAID

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:10.485
BEFORE THE WOMAN UNDERSTANDS

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:13.054
THAT IT'S HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE.

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:14.122
WHICH MEANS THAT SHE'S OFTEN

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:15.857
HAVING TO TAKE IT A SECOND TIME

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:17.926
WHICH IS PUSHING AGAINST THE TEN

01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:19.160
WEEK WINDOW.

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:20.395

BEFORE BETWEEN -- TAKEN THE PILL

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.333
THE SURGICAL ABORTION -- THAT

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.668
MAY BE NEEDED HAS ALLOWED THAT

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:28.803
BABY TO MATURE EVEN FOR TO A

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:31.539
FURTHER STEP MAYBE CAUSING MORE

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:32.273
COMPLICATIONS.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.409
IF THE MEDICATION ABORTION FAILS

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:35.744
TO TERMINATE THE PREGNANCY THE

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:37.445
TIME COMMITMENT AND COSTS RISE

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:39.447
EVEN FURTHER AS A PATIENT NEEDS

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:40.548
ANOTHER ROUND A MEDICATION

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:43.618
ABORTION OR IF TOO LATE A

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:44.953
SURGICAL ABORTION.

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:46.221
IF THE MEDICAL ABORTION DOESN'T

01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:47.522
WORK AFTER TEN WEEKS THE WOMAN

01:23:47.589 --> 01:23:49.357
WILL HAVE TO UTILIZE A SURGICAL

01:23:49.424 --> 01:23:50.859
ABORTION.

01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:52.327
SECOND TRIMESTER SURGICAL

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:53.762
ABORTIONS PROCEDURES ARE

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:55.530
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE AND

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:57.265
CARRY A MUCH GREATER OVERALL

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:58.767
RISK TO THE MOTHER.

01:23:58.833 --> 01:23:59.968
THESE RISKS INCLUDE HEAVY

01:24:00.034 --> 01:24:02.971

ABORTION PILL GIVES A FALSE

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:37.806
SENSE OF SECURITY. TWO YOUNG

AND STILL MIGHT HAVE THOSE SIDE

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:54.516
EFFECTS NOW WHILE I'M NOT

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:59.087
SO FORTH WHEREVER SHE GETS THIS

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:01.389

BE -- A A SIDE EFFECT -- BAD

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:08.029
SIDE EFFECTS SHE IS GOING TO

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:09.464
FACE THE SAME.

01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:12.700
ISSUE AND SO IT'S IF IT'S AN

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:14.269
EMERGENCY IT'S GOING TO BE AN

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:16.604
EMERGENCY WHETHER OR NOT.

01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:18.606
THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:20.074
ADMINISTERS THE FIRST BILL OR

01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:22.844
WHETHER IT'S DONE TWO MILES AWAY.

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:25.813
SO I I I I WHILE I'M NOT

PREPARED TO TO TO COME IN AND I

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:29.050
DO FEEL IF WE LOOK AT IT FROM

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.652
THE PERSPECTIVE OF WOMEN ARE

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:31.653
GETTING THIS OUTSIDE OF THE

01:26:31.719 --> 01:26:35.924
STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS ARE GOING

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:37.559
BACK ON CAMPUS NOW IT.

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:38.359
IT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:39.694
ADDRESSED BY THIS BILL.

01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:40.595
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU BUT

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:42.130
WHEN YOU HAVE A A WOMAN IS GOING

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:44.732
ONTO A CAMPUS FACILITY.

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:46.267
AND THEY'RE BEGINNING AND

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:48.303
INITIATING A MEDICAL TREATMENT

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:50.471
THAT HAS COMPLICATIONS.

01:26:50.538 --> 01:26:52.073
AND THOSE COMPLICATIONS CAN

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:54.275
INSTANCES ALBEIT RARE.

01:26:54.342 --> 01:26:54.842
CAN BE THAT THE LIFE OF THE

01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:55.910
WOMAN.

01:26:55.977 --> 01:26:58.279
ALL FOR HOSPITALIZATION

01:26:58.346 --> 01:26:58.580
[inaudible]

01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:00.748
TO MITIGATE HEMORRHAGING.

01:27:00.815 --> 01:27:01.816
I BELIEVE THERE CAN BE A

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.718
LIABILITY ON THE CAMPUS THAT

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:05.119
INITIATED THAT TREATMENT SO.

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:06.688
YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION I

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:07.789
APPRECIATE THAT.

01:27:07.855 --> 01:27:09.090
MY MY CONCERN ABOUT THE

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:11.292
LIABILITY OF COLLEGE CAMPUSES --

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:12.860
IT REMAINS AND I'M HOPING THAT

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:14.729
THE AUTHOR WILL WILL WORK

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:15.730
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND

01:27:15.797 --> 01:27:16.965
ASSUMING THE BILL GETS OUT WHICH

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:19.634
I'M SURE PROBABLY WILL --

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:21.736
BECAUSE THIS COULD BE OF A LOT

01:27:21.803 --> 01:27:24.272
OF EXPOSURE -- THE YOUNG AND THE

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:25.573
LIVES OF YOUNG WOMEN WHO MAY

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.275
FACE SEVERE COMPLICATIONS IS

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:28.776
ALSO A MAJOR CONCERN OF MINE

01:27:28.843 --> 01:27:30.111
HEALTH AND SAFETY.

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:32.614
OF WOMEN ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.315
NEEDS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:36.250
GIVING THEM A FALSE SENSE OF

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.919
SECURITY WITH AN EASY FIX. TO

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.420
THE ABORTION NEEDS DOESN'T SEEM

01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:42.156
LIKE A WISE COURSE OF ACTION TO

01:27:42.223 --> 01:27:44.359
TAKE SO FOR THOSE REASONS.

WHAT I AM MOST INTERESTED IN IS

01:32:52.166 --> 01:32:54.468
REALLY KIND OF THE?

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:56.637
HOW IT'S OPERATIONALIZED HOW WE

01:32:56.704 --> 01:32:58.039
IN THE SYSTEM THAT'S NOT

01:32:58.105 --> 01:33:01.242
CONSISTENT THAT PIECE -- THE

01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:04.278
ARGUMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

01:33:04.345 --> 01:33:07.114
ONE IS ANTI CHOICE OR PRO CHOICE

01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:09.417
IS MOOT TO ME.

01:33:09.483 --> 01:33:11.485
IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL --

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:14.789
FOR THOSE WHO -- DON'T BELIEVE

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.390
IN ABORTION.

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:20.227
DON'T HAVE.

01:33:20.294 --> 01:33:21.862
ONE AND SO THE CONVERSATION

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:23.331
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:25.132
HAVE FULL COMPLETE ACCESS TO

SERVICES I DEEP APPROPRIATE FOR

01:33:28.002 --> 01:33:31.439
ME SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO ME.

01:33:31.505 --> 01:33:33.074
AGAIN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:34.108
NOT THE ISSUE HERE UNFORTUNATELY

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:35.843
THAT'S WHAT.

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:37.111
MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION IS

01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:39.146
FOCUSED ON WHICH IS OFTEN THE

01:33:39.213 --> 01:33:39.780

01:33:48.089 --> 01:33:49.023
THE BILL.

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:51.959
AND I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT --

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:54.128
THAT WE FIGURE OUT THE WAY IN

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:56.630
WHICH IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:59.567
SYSTEM IN WHICH WE ARE ASKING --

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:04.171

A MEDICATION.

01:34:07.742 --> 01:34:11.212
I THINK IT IS -- UNFAIR -- WHEN

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:13.314
WE HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:15.149
WE FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY OR VERY

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:18.285
NARROWLY ON COMPLICATIONS AS YOU

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:19.520
KNOW MISTER CHAIR I'M CARRYING A

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:21.655

UNIVERSITY -- LET ME PARTY

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:37.998
DIFFERENTLY AS A BUSINESS OWNER

01:35:38.065 --> 01:35:39.800
I KNOW THAT IF I DO.

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:42.036
X. IT CREATES A CERTAIN

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:43.771
LIABILITY.

01:35:43.838 --> 01:35:45.840
I KNOW IF I I PROVIDE TO

01:35:45.906 --> 01:35:47.208
STAFFING RIGHT IF I STAFF

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:48.976
SOMEBODY IN A CLERICAL OFFICE I

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:49.376
HAVE.

01:35:49.443 --> 01:35:52.046
THIS PIECE OF LIABILITY.

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:52.613
THERE'S A CHANCE THEY'LL GET

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.581
INJURED.

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:56.016
NOT REALLY IF I PUT A REFER ON A

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:57.518
ROOF THERE'S A HIGHER RISK OF

01:35:57.585 --> 01:35:59.787
LIABILITY.

01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:03.257
DO YOU SEE THAT THE THIS BILL IN

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:04.391
IMPLEMENTING THIS BILL ON A

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:07.094
UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IS IT THE SAME.

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:09.330
LIABILITY EXPOSURE OR DO YOU SEE

01:36:09.396 --> 01:36:10.998
IT AS A HIGHER OR LOWER.

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:17.204
OR LIABILITY EXPOSURE -- THIS

01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:18.672
BILL HAS STORE THIS CONCEPT HAS

01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:20.107
BEEN LOOKED AT FOR A COUPLE OF

01:36:20.174 --> 01:36:22.543
YEARS AND WE JUST HAVE NOT HEARD

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:24.378
A LOT OF RINGING FROM THE

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:26.647
UNIVERSITY AND WE'RE NOT A QUIET

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:28.182
GROUP TYPICALLY.

01:36:28.249 --> 01:36:30.684
BUT ABOUT THE LIABILITY THAT

01:36:30.751 --> 01:36:32.253
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE'S NONE

01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:34.255
BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN IS PART OF

01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:35.556
OUR ANALYSIS.

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:37.691
RAISING THAT IT REALLY HAS BEEN

01:36:37.758 --> 01:36:39.627
A MATTER OF STUDENT HEALTH

01:36:39.693 --> 01:36:42.196
CENTERS ARE NOT HOSPITALS AND SO

01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:45.432
HOW DO THEY MANAGE THEIR BUDGETS

01:36:45.499 --> 01:36:47.935
AND HOW DO THEY DETERMINE WHICH

01:36:48.002 --> 01:36:49.370
ARE WHICH SERVICES ARE BETTER

01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:51.605
OFFER ON WAS NOT NECESSARILY A

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:54.375
DECISION ABOUT LIABILITY -- IT

01:36:54.441 --> 01:36:57.244
WAS MORE OF A DECISION ABOUT --

01:36:57.311 --> 01:36:59.079
WE WE FOR OTHER SERVICES OFF

01:36:59.146 --> 01:37:01.515
CAMPUS AS WELL SO WE DON'T HAVE

01:37:01.582 --> 01:37:02.983
ALL SERVICES.

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:04.418
IN THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:05.819
BECAUSE THE GOAL OF THE STUDENT

01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:07.888
HEALTH CENTER IS TO HAVE IS LOW

01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:10.024
OR NO COST AS POSSIBLE SO

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:11.492
WHEREVER WE CAN.

01:37:11.559 --> 01:37:14.495
FIND A COMMUNITY PROVIDER WE DO

01:37:14.562 --> 01:37:15.196
AND WHENEVER WE CAN DO IT IN

01:37:15.262 --> 01:37:17.798
HOUSE WE DO SO IT REALLY IS VERY

01:37:17.865 --> 01:37:20.534
MUCH A LOCAL DECISION AND IT'S

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:22.236
IN IN IT AND AND THE DECISION

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:23.504
HASN'T BEEN.

01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:24.872
LET'S LOOK AT THE STRANDS OF

01:37:24.939 --> 01:37:27.308
LIABILITY AND DECIDE THIS VERSUS

01:37:27.374 --> 01:37:27.841
THAT SO RIGHT.

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:30.444
AT THAT THAT'S NOT BEEN -- TO MY

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:31.879
KNOWLEDGE THE WAY THE DECISIONS

01:37:31.946 --> 01:37:36.217
ON BRINGING SERVICES ON OR OFF

01:37:36.283 --> 01:37:37.985
HAVE BEEN MADE.

01:37:38.052 --> 01:37:38.586
BUT I'M ASKING YOU IS SOMEBODY

01:37:38.652 --> 01:37:40.354
THAT REPRESENTS THE UNIVERSITY.

01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:42.423
IF YES M. THIS BILL GOES FOR

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:43.390
WOMEN I GUESS I SHOULD SAY THIS

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:43.824
BILL GOES FORWARD.

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:44.725
AND YOUR MANDATED IN THE

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.393
UNIVERSITIES ARE MANDATED TO

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:47.628
PROVIDE THIS SERVICE.

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:49.496
DOES IT CREATE A GREATER RISK OF

01:37:49.563 --> 01:37:52.600
YOUR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:54.735
SELF FUNDED INSURANCE BEFORE IT

01:37:54.802 --> 01:37:56.136
GOES OUT TO RE INSURANCE.

01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:58.339
OR IS IT JUST A SIMPLE AS GIVING

01:37:58.405 --> 01:38:01.041
SOMEBODY A STICK TO URINATE ON

01:38:01.108 --> 01:38:01.575
TO SEE IF THEY'RE PREGNANT

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:01.875
[inaudible]

01:38:01.942 --> 01:38:06.247
I I DON'T AND I DON'T KNOW I

01:38:06.313 --> 01:38:07.982
DON'T KNOW I THINK IT WILL

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:11.752
DEPEND ON AND THE THAT THE RISK

01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:13.287
IS IS ABOUT NUMBERS IT'S ABOUT

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:16.023
HOW MANY POTENTIAL CASES AND THE

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:20.461
LIKE SO -- AND SO I I I REALLY

01:38:20.527 --> 01:38:21.729

01:38:24.131 --> 01:38:26.300
AFTER THE HEARING -- BECAUSE I

01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:28.569
DON'T KNOW THE EXACT ANSWER TO

01:38:28.636 --> 01:38:30.170
YOUR QUESTION.

01:38:30.237 --> 01:38:31.205

TO BAD GEE I REALLY I'M NOT I'M

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:34.341
JUST TRYING TO COME TO A

01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:36.944
CONCLUSION OR MAYBE -- THAT

RIGHT NOW I APOLOGIZE I MEAN I

01:38:47.254 --> 01:38:48.522

LIFTED IT I HAVE HAVE CAUSED ANY

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:20.247
KIND OF BEING MANDATED TO PUT

01:40:20.314 --> 01:40:20.948
THIS BILL ON THE STATE

UNIVERSITY CAMPUS DO YOU THINK

01:40:22.383 --> 01:40:23.951

AND MORE OF A RISK.

01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:30.958
SO I AM I AM A LITTLE CONFUSED

01:40:31.024 --> 01:40:31.892
BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY DOING

01:40:31.959 --> 01:40:33.827
PREGNANCY TEST THAT WON'T CHANGE

01:40:33.894 --> 01:40:35.129
THIS BILL DOESN'T MANDATE THAT

BLEEDING CRAMPING SURGICAL

01:40:46.607 --> 01:40:48.175
PROCEDURES THAT ARE NEEDED.

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:49.910
DOES THAT CREATE A GREATER RISK

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:52.179
OF LIABILITY TO YOURSELF FUNDING

01:40:52.246 --> 01:40:55.149

POTENTIAL BUT I WOULD HAVE TO

01:41:07.928 --> 01:41:10.898
SPEAK WITH -- SOME EXPERTS ABOUT

01:41:10.964 --> 01:41:14.101

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:20.100
WHERE.

01:42:20.167 --> 01:42:21.869

BEFORE -- THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.754
YOU SEE HAS BEEN AND I ASSUME

01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:42.356
CSU HAS ALSO LOOKED AT THE BILL

01:42:42.422 --> 01:42:43.323
AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:44.658
DIFFERENT ISSUES AND THAT THAT

01:42:45.692 --> 01:42:47.194
YOUR CLEANERS BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:48.395
SOME ISSUES.

01:42:48.462 --> 01:42:56.436
BUT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT FOCUS

01:42:56.503 --> 01:42:58.572

01:43:04.444 --> 01:43:05.445
BIG THING THAT RUNS WORRIED

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:05.646
ABOUT.

01:43:05.712 --> 01:43:06.480
WELL FROM THE UC PERSPECTIVE I

01:43:06.547 --> 01:43:08.882
CAN'T SPEAK FOR CSU RIGHT AND I

01:43:08.949 --> 01:43:09.883
KNOW IT UNLOCKS IKIZI FOR UC'S

01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:11.685

01:43:11.752 --> 01:43:12.019

THE KKK COME UP BUT AT THE END

01:43:20.394 --> 01:43:21.995

01:43:57.197 --> 01:43:57.631
CAMPUS.

01:43:57.698 --> 01:43:59.299
YOU KNOW I WOULD HATE TO SEE

THAT I GOT PREGNANT AND I WENT

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:38.198
TO MY STUDENT HEALTH CENTER

01:45:38.265 --> 01:45:39.466
WHERE THEY TOLD ME THAT I WAS

01:45:39.533 --> 01:45:42.769
PREGNANT -- OUT AGAIN I WAS A

01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:44.171
GRADUATE ARE I AM A GRADUATE OF

UC RIVERSIDE SO AT THE UC

01:45:47.841 --> 01:45:48.675
STUDENT HEALTH CENTER -- THEY

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:50.610
THEN SET UP ANOTHER APPOINTMENT

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:53.947
WITH AN OB GEIN -- WHERE THAT OB

01:45:54.014 --> 01:45:56.316
GYN TOLD ME ABOUT THREE

01:45:56.383 --> 01:45:58.118
DIFFERENT PLACES I COULD GO TO

01:45:58.185 --> 01:45:59.953
STEP THREE DIFFERENT REFERRALS --

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:01.421
THE FIRST FACILITY THAT I WAS

01:46:01.488 --> 01:46:04.958
SENT TO DIDN'T OFFER ABORTION

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:07.094
SERVICES -- AND SO THAT DELAYED

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.395
A LOT OF MY CARE -- THE SECOND

01:46:08.462 --> 01:46:11.598
FACILITY THAT I WAS THAN REFER.

01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:13.867
TO THEN TOLD ME -- I WAS ABLE TO

01:46:13.934 --> 01:46:17.637
SCHEDULE MY APPOINTMENT THERE.

01:46:17.704 --> 01:46:20.974
BUT AFTERWARD THEY YOU KNOW

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:21.942
AFTER YOU KNOW DEALING WITH THAT

01:46:22.008 --> 01:46:22.509
THEY SAID THAT THEY COULD.

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:23.477
GIVE ME AN APPOINTMENT ABOUT A

01:46:23.543 --> 01:46:30.884
MONTH AND A HALF OUT -- FROM

01:46:30.951 --> 01:46:40.794
THAT TIME THAT I CALLED -- AND

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:52.973
AS YOU ALL OF MENTIONED.

01:46:53.039 --> 01:46:53.607
HAVING AN ABORTION IS A DEEPLY

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:59.079
PERSONAL DECISION BUT ONCE

01:46:59.146 --> 01:47:00.347
SOMEONE HAS MADE THAT DECISION

01:47:00.413 --> 01:47:12.192
THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT -- AND SO

01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:13.627
SO ONE IMPORTANT THING TO

01:47:13.693 --> 01:47:15.729
REMEMBER HERE AS YOU DISCUSS

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:18.565
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE RIGHTS AND OUR

01:47:18.632 --> 01:47:19.766
BEAR YEARS ARE BARRIERS ARE

RATES EXCUSE ME ARE EXACERBATED

01:47:21.635 --> 01:47:24.538
BECAUSE WE ARE YOUNGER PEOPLE --

01:47:24.604 --> 01:47:27.507
SO.

01:47:27.574 --> 01:47:29.209
THAT SO FROM THERE -- I CAN GET

01:47:29.276 --> 01:47:34.147
MY APPOINTMENTS AND BRINGING UP

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:35.415
ANOTHER BAY AREA THE STIGMA.

01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:36.850
YOU KNOW AS YOU MENTIONED CENTER

01:47:36.917 --> 01:47:37.784
YOUR ALSO PUTTING.

01:47:37.851 --> 01:47:40.253
YOU KNOW PUTTING A REPRODUCTIVE

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:41.922
ON HEALTH CARE UNDER THIS

01:47:41.988 --> 01:47:44.090
MAGNIFYING GLASS -- I HAD

01:47:44.157 --> 01:47:45.559
REMAINED SILENT THROUGHOUT THIS

01:47:45.625 --> 01:47:46.760
WHOLE TIME AND THEN FINALLY

01:47:46.827 --> 01:47:49.429
BROKE MY SILENCE WHEN -- I

01:47:49.496 --> 01:47:50.263
FINALLY WENT TO A PLANNED

01:47:50.330 --> 01:48:03.677
PARENTHOOD BECAUSE I OPENED UP

01:48:03.743 --> 01:48:05.278
AND I TOLD SOMEONE ABOUT IT.

01:48:05.345 --> 01:48:10.750
BUT DIAZ OF THOUGHT IN A

01:48:10.817 --> 01:48:13.520
NUTSHELL IS WHAT HAPPENED.

01:48:13.587 --> 01:48:14.788
OKAY I HEAR MOTION FOR THE BELT --

01:48:14.855 --> 01:48:18.258
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING

01:48:18.325 --> 01:48:21.228
IT AND ACTUALLY SO LEYVA.

01:48:21.294 --> 01:48:23.263
SOUNDS THAT SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:24.064
THE ISSUE SO ASIDE FROM LACK OF

01:48:24.130 --> 01:48:26.032
AVAILABILITY ON CAMPUS IS ALSO

01:48:26.099 --> 01:48:28.268
AND THAT AND FRANKLY -- I COULD

01:48:28.335 --> 01:48:29.102
ASK YOU THE QUESTION I KNOW WHAT

01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:29.736
THE ANSWER IS IS THAT ANY

01:48:29.803 --> 01:48:30.971
FACILITY INCLUDING SOON HEALTH

01:48:31.037 --> 01:48:31.638
FACILITY SHOULD ALSO HAVE

01:48:31.705 --> 01:48:33.406
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER

01:48:33.473 --> 01:48:35.642
PROVIDERS ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:38.078
WHAT I HEAR IS THAT THEY THEY

01:48:38.144 --> 01:48:39.312
REFERRED -- FOR YOU TO A PERSON

01:48:39.379 --> 01:48:40.747
THAT DIDN'T ACTUALLY WAS ABLE TO

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:42.515
PROVIDE SERVICE OR SOMETHING WE

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:43.516
NEED SOME IMPROVEMENTS THERE.

01:48:43.583 --> 01:48:44.951
TOO AND I AND I KNOW THAT YOU

01:48:45.018 --> 01:48:46.253
SEE ALSO OPERATES LOTS OF

01:48:46.319 --> 01:48:50.824
MEDICAL CENTERS AS WELL SINCE I

01:48:50.891 --> 01:48:53.460
USED TO PRACTICE AT ONE DID YOU.

01:48:53.526 --> 01:48:54.527
SAY SOMETHING YES IF I MAY

01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:55.962
SENATOR JUST BRIEFLY THIS IS

01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:56.429
BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT

01:48:56.496 --> 01:48:58.031
CONVERSATION I THINK FOR THE

01:48:58.098 --> 01:48:59.432
PAST YEAR OR SO -- ON THIS ISSUE

01:48:59.499 --> 01:49:01.234
AND ONE OF THE RESULTS OF HAVING

01:49:01.301 --> 01:49:02.269
THIS ISSUE WAS TO RECOGNIZE.

01:49:02.335 --> 01:49:04.437
THAT STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS AND

01:49:04.504 --> 01:49:05.705
WE'VE DIRECTOR ARE STUDENT

01:49:05.772 --> 01:49:07.207
HEALTH CENTERS TO MAKE SURE --

01:49:07.274 --> 01:49:08.208
THAT THEIR THEIR THEIR LISTS ARE

01:49:08.275 --> 01:49:09.609
ACCURATE INTO NOT JUST REFER BUT

01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:10.410
TO DO MORE OF A WARM HAND OFF TO

01:49:10.477 --> 01:49:12.312
MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENT GETS

01:49:12.379 --> 01:49:13.280
THE APPOINTMENT THAT THEY

01:49:13.346 --> 01:49:14.447
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF

01:49:14.514 --> 01:49:15.515
THING YOU GIVE THEM A SHEET OF

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:16.349
PAPER AND SAY GO.

01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:17.617
AND DO AN EVEN IF THIS BILL

01:49:17.684 --> 01:49:18.485
PASSES IT DOESN'T ENSURE THAT

01:49:18.551 --> 01:49:19.286
EVERY STUDENT IS GOING TO WANT

01:49:19.352 --> 01:49:20.954
TO HAVE THE PROCEDURE THERE ON

01:49:21.021 --> 01:49:22.155
THE STUDENT HEALTH CAMPUS.

01:49:22.222 --> 01:49:22.989
SO WE STILL NEED I THINK FROM

01:49:23.056 --> 01:49:24.190
THE UNIVERSITY'S PERSPECTIVE TO

01:49:24.257 --> 01:49:26.493
PROVIDE THAT SERVICE OF A MORE

01:49:26.559 --> 01:49:28.161
WARM HAND OFF SO YOU'RE NOT.

01:49:28.228 --> 01:49:29.195
THREE MONTHS TRYING TO FIGURE

01:49:29.262 --> 01:49:31.264
OUT INSURANCE AND IS THIS THE

01:49:31.331 --> 01:49:32.899
RIGHT PROVIDER AND DOES IT WORK

WE RECEIVED THAT VETO MESSAGE

01:50:15.575 --> 01:50:16.409
FROM THE GOVERNOR.

01:50:16.476 --> 01:50:17.877

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:29.556
NOR DID MANY OF THIS THAT THE

01:50:29.622 --> 01:50:30.223

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:31.891
SECOND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:33.326
BIT ABOUT LIABILITY.

LIVE IN A VERY LITIGIOUS SOCIETY

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:44.804
AND IF WE ARE GOING TO WORRY

01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:46.406
ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPENED WHICH

01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:47.440
I DO THINK THAT'S LEGITIMATE

01:50:47.507 --> 01:50:48.141
CONCERN.

01:50:48.208 --> 01:50:49.175
WHAT HAPPENS AT THE U. S. C.

01:50:49.242 --> 01:50:50.243
RIGHT NOW WHO TREATS A STUDENT

01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:51.011
WITH DIABETES IN THE STATE AND

01:50:51.077 --> 01:50:52.045
THE STUDENT GOES INTO A DIABETIC

01:50:52.112 --> 01:50:52.245
COMA?

01:50:52.312 --> 01:50:53.747
IS THE IS THE UC ARE THIS ISSUE

01:50:53.813 --> 01:50:54.647
LIABLE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE

01:50:54.714 --> 01:50:55.215
TREATING SOMEONE FOR MENTAL

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:56.216
ILLNESS AND THEY TRY TO HARM

01:50:56.282 --> 01:50:58.051
THEMSELVES IS THE USE YOUR THE

01:50:58.118 --> 01:50:59.586
C. ISSUE LIABLE.

01:50:59.652 --> 01:51:00.920
WHEN MY DAUGHTERS WERE IN

01:51:00.987 --> 01:51:02.956
COLLEGE THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR --

01:51:03.023 --> 01:51:04.724
OF ONE OF THE TEAMMATES STUMBLED

01:51:04.791 --> 01:51:06.426
INTO THE ROOM SO DRUNK THAT SHE

01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:08.895
WET HERSELF AND PASSED OUT.

01:51:08.962 --> 01:51:10.196
MY GIRLS CALLED ME AND I SAID

01:51:10.263 --> 01:51:12.332
DEAR GOD HANG UP AND CALL 911-

01:51:12.399 --> 01:51:16.469
WHICH THEY DID AND LATER THE

01:51:16.536 --> 01:51:17.804
MOTHER OF THE STUDENT TRIED TO

01:51:17.871 --> 01:51:19.939
TRIED TO SUE US BECAUSE SHE LOST

01:51:20.006 --> 01:51:21.674
HER SCHOLARSHIP.

01:51:21.741 --> 01:51:23.777
AND TRIED TO SQUISH ARE TRIED TO

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:25.645
SUE THE THE COLLEGE.

01:51:25.712 --> 01:51:27.814
SO I THINK THAT WE CAN'T ALWAYS

01:51:27.881 --> 01:51:30.016
WORRY ABOUT LIABILITY IT IS

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:32.118
ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERE IT'S

01:51:32.185 --> 01:51:32.786
UNFORTUNATELY THE WORLD THAT WE

01:51:32.852 --> 01:51:33.586
LIVE IN.

01:51:33.653 --> 01:51:38.291
BUT I WILL END WITH THIS.

01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:38.992
WHEN I GOT ELECTED IN CAME TO

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:40.026
SACRAMENTO I FOUND OUT VERY

01:51:40.093 --> 01:51:41.027
QUICKLY THAT I'D KIND OF BEEN

01:51:41.094 --> 01:51:42.595
RAISED IN AND LIVED IN A BUBBLE?

01:51:42.662 --> 01:51:44.397
I LIVED IN THIS VERY WARM

01:51:44.464 --> 01:51:46.599
ENVIRONMENT WHERE MY PARENTS

01:51:46.666 --> 01:51:48.101
TALKED TO ME ABOUT MY RIGHTS

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:50.003
WHERE I KNEW THAT A WOMAN HAD

01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:51.671
THE RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

01:51:51.738 --> 01:51:53.273
THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT AND

01:51:53.339 --> 01:51:54.908
THERE WAS NO SHAME AND THEN I

01:51:54.974 --> 01:51:56.843
GOT HERE AND I WAS JUST

01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:59.179
ABSOLUTELY DUMBFOUNDED.

01:51:59.245 --> 01:52:01.114
AND THIS HASN'T HAPPENED TODAY

01:52:01.181 --> 01:52:02.615
BUT DUMBFOUNDED BY HOW THE

01:52:02.682 --> 01:52:05.051
OPPOSITION SHAMED WOMEN FOR

01:52:05.118 --> 01:52:07.020
ACCESSING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL

01:52:07.087 --> 01:52:10.256
RIGHT HOW WOMEN FEEL STIGMATIZED

01:52:10.323 --> 01:52:11.958
AND SO I SAID TO MYSELF I SAID

01:52:12.025 --> 01:52:12.625
YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T WANT THAT

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:13.593
TO HAPPEN ANYMORE.

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.195
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN WANT TO SAY

01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:15.929
THE WORD ABORTION IS LIKE A

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:18.131
PORTION YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS PART

01:52:18.198 --> 01:52:19.833

CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ACCESS

IT IS YOUR BODY YOU HAVE THE

01:52:24.337 --> 01:52:26.139
RIGHT TO DECIDE NO ONE ELSE HAS

01:52:26.206 --> 01:52:26.840
THAT RIGHT.

01:52:26.906 --> 01:52:28.508
SO FOR ME THIS IS THIS IS

01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:29.509
PERSONAL IN THE SENSE THAT I

01:52:29.576 --> 01:52:31.511

DO THAT.

02:45:26.449 --> 02:45:27.484
MORE SIGNIFICANTLY KAISER ALSO

02:45:27.550 --> 02:45:28.618
DOESN'T BREAK OUT PRICES BY

02:45:28.685 --> 02:45:30.587

LUMPS ALMOST ALL OF THAT INTO A

02:45:45.568 --> 02:45:47.704
SINGLE HOSPITAL INPATIENT NUMBER.

02:45:47.771 --> 02:45:49.205

ONLY OTHER CATEGORY REPORTED

02:45:52.108 --> 02:45:52.876

02:45:52.942 --> 02:45:53.576
WITH REGARD TO HOSPITAL

02:45:53.643 --> 02:45:54.911
REPORTING COSTS CALIFORNIA

02:45:54.978 --> 02:45:58.848
HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE REQUIRED TO

02:45:58.915 --> 02:46:00.383
INDIVIDUAL HOSPITAL.

02:46:00.450 --> 02:46:01.084
EYES ARE ON THE OTHER HAND

02:46:01.151 --> 02:46:03.253
REPORTS THESE FINANCIAL FIGURES

02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:04.354
FOR ALL OF ITS NORTHERN OR

02:46:04.421 --> 02:46:05.855
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS IN

02:46:05.922 --> 02:46:07.190
AGATE SO YOU GET A NUMBER FOR

02:46:07.257 --> 02:46:08.658
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND A NUMBER

02:46:08.725 --> 02:46:09.826
FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:46:09.893 --> 02:46:11.061
WE CERTAINLY KNOW HEISER HAS

02:46:11.127 --> 02:46:14.731
MANY FACILITIES -- WITHIN EACH.

02:46:14.798 --> 02:46:16.166
NOW.

02:46:16.232 --> 02:46:17.701
I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND KAISER'S

02:46:17.767 --> 02:46:18.802
LEVEL DIFFERENCE.

02:46:18.868 --> 02:46:20.537
BUT THIS SPECIAL TREATMENT

02:46:20.603 --> 02:46:22.339
OBSCURES IMPORTANT NOBLE

02:46:22.405 --> 02:46:25.208
KNOWLEDGE -- ABOUT WHAT'S GOING

02:46:25.275 --> 02:46:26.576
ON TO A VERY SIGNIFICANT PLAYER

02:46:26.643 --> 02:46:28.044
IN THE HEALTHCARE MARKET HERE IN

02:46:28.111 --> 02:46:29.079
CALIFORNIA.

02:46:29.145 --> 02:46:30.780
IT ALSO DOES PROVIDE CERTAIN

02:46:30.847 --> 02:46:32.215
ADVANTAGES THE KAISER AND

02:46:32.282 --> 02:46:33.850
PREVENTS OUR LAWS FROM BEING

02:46:33.917 --> 02:46:36.720
IMPLEMENTED AS THEIR INTENDED.

02:46:36.786 --> 02:46:37.620
SO AS I MENTIONED AT KAISER

02:46:37.687 --> 02:46:39.122
REPRESENTS ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIA

02:46:39.189 --> 02:46:41.257
HOSPITALS MORE THAN 40% OF

02:46:41.324 --> 02:46:42.826
INSURED CALIFORNIANS WITH THE

02:46:42.892 --> 02:46:44.060
COMMERCIAL COVERAGE.

02:46:44.127 --> 02:46:45.562
SO THIS BECOMES AN INFORMATION

02:46:45.628 --> 02:46:46.830
GAP THAT MEANS THAT STATE

02:46:46.896 --> 02:46:48.064
REGULATORS LACTAID ON THE

02:46:48.131 --> 02:46:50.033
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

02:46:50.100 --> 02:46:51.101
HEALTH CARE MARKET.

02:46:51.167 --> 02:46:53.103
AND AS HEALTHCARE COSTS CONTINUE

02:46:53.169 --> 02:46:54.771
TO RISE POLICY MAKERS PURCHASERS

02:46:54.838 --> 02:46:57.107
AND CONSUMERS NEED ACCESS TO THE

02:46:57.173 --> 02:46:58.408
SAME INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS

02:46:58.475 --> 02:46:59.909
DRIVING COST INCREASES THAT

02:46:59.976 --> 02:47:01.978
KAISER'S THEY DO AT EVERY OTHER

02:47:02.045 --> 02:47:03.446
HOSPITAL AND HEALTH PLAN.

02:47:03.513 --> 02:47:05.448
AND SO I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE

02:47:05.515 --> 02:47:07.517
THAT -- WE WANT TO WORK WITH

02:47:07.584 --> 02:47:08.485
KAISER.

02:47:08.551 --> 02:47:09.853
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE

THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT WE'VE

02:49:09.172 --> 02:49:11.674
HAD LARGE GROUP RATE REVIEW IN

INCREASES FOR FIVE MILLION

02:49:18.715 --> 02:49:21.351

EVERY YEAR YEAR OVER YEAR THOSE

AMONG KAISER'S MEMBERS.

02:49:36.766 --> 02:49:39.602
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:49:39.669 --> 02:49:42.105
LEGISLATION WILL ALLOW US TO

02:49:42.171 --> 02:49:44.440
UNCOVER WHAT'S DRIVING THOSE

02:49:44.507 --> 02:49:45.742

ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE STATE AT

02:49:58.955 --> 02:50:00.323

02:50:08.431 --> 02:50:09.599
INSURERS.

02:50:09.666 --> 02:50:10.600

THESE COMPONENTS ARE COSTING AND

02:51:01.150 --> 02:51:03.586
BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW -- THE

02:52:13.156 --> 02:52:14.657
GET AWAY WITH IT.

02:52:14.724 --> 02:52:15.958
THE RATE REVIEW LAW REQUIRES

HOW ARE THEY PROVIDING CARE TO

02:52:44.454 --> 02:52:46.522
ALMOST NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS

02:52:46.589 --> 02:52:48.157

HOSPITALS?

02:52:51.094 --> 02:52:52.695
WE KNOW FROM OUR WORK ON OTHER

02:52:52.762 --> 02:52:54.430
RATE REVIEW BILLS THAT KAISER

TYPES OF CARE.

02:53:01.838 --> 02:53:04.040
AND THEY DO IT QUARTERLY YET IN

02:53:04.107 --> 02:53:05.875
THEIR RATE FILINGS KAISER SAYS

02:53:05.942 --> 02:53:07.944
THEY CANNOT PUBLICLY EXPLAIN

02:53:08.010 --> 02:53:09.912
WHAT THEY SPEND ON DOCTORS

AND THEY POINT TO THE SENTENCE

02:53:14.217 --> 02:53:15.885
THAT SB THREE FORTY THREE

02:53:15.952 --> 02:53:18.154
DELETES AS THE REASON THAT THE

02:53:18.221 --> 02:53:19.589
LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE THEM.

02:53:19.655 --> 02:53:21.124
TO THAT IS NOT WHAT THE SENTENCE

02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:24.227
SAYS T IS NOT WHAT IT MEANT THE

02:53:24.293 --> 02:53:25.061
FAILURE OF THE PRIOR

02:53:25.128 --> 02:53:26.796

02:53:29.565 --> 02:53:30.967
KAISER IS A MAJOR PART OF OUR

THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED

02:53:36.973 --> 02:53:39.075
HEALTHCARE CANNOT DETERMINE

02:53:39.142 --> 02:53:40.042
WHETHER KAISER.

02:53:40.109 --> 02:53:41.477
KAISER IS RATES ARE REASONABLE

02:53:41.544 --> 02:53:43.079
OR JUSTIFIED BECAUSE KAISER

02:53:43.146 --> 02:53:44.413

WE SUPPORT SB THREE FORTY THREE

02:53:51.587 --> 02:53:52.155
BECAUSE IT DILUTES THE SENTENCE

02:53:52.221 --> 02:53:53.156
THE KAISER HAS USED AS AN EXCUSE

02:53:53.222 --> 02:53:53.890
FOR AVOIDING COMPLIANCE WITH

02:57:15.791 --> 02:57:17.493

QUALITY INTEGRATED DELIVERY

02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:26.235
SYSTEM -- WE DO FEEL THIS BILL

02:57:26.302 --> 02:57:28.037
IS IS MISGUIDED AND SHORT

02:57:28.104 --> 02:57:29.105
SIGHTED.

02:57:29.171 --> 02:57:30.740
I DO WANT TO CORRECT -- SEVERAL

02:57:30.806 --> 02:57:32.375
ACTUALLY MIS CHARACTERIZATIONS

02:57:32.441 --> 02:57:34.143
ABOUT ABOUT CURRENT LAW IN THE

02:57:34.210 --> 02:57:35.945
BILL IT IS IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND

02:57:36.012 --> 02:57:37.880
WE ARE NOT EXEMPT -- FROM EITHER

02:57:37.947 --> 02:57:39.348
OF THE LAWS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT

02:57:39.415 --> 02:57:40.516
OF THIS MEASURE AND ALL ALL

02:57:40.583 --> 02:57:42.685
EXPLAIN THAT MORE THERE ARE.

02:57:42.752 --> 02:57:44.186
NO EXEMPTIONS NO EXCEPTIONS --

02:57:44.253 --> 02:57:45.988
AND AND THE CHARACTERIZATION

02:57:46.055 --> 02:57:47.490
THAT KAISER IS NOT THAT

02:57:47.556 --> 02:57:49.492
DIFFERENT ANYMORE -- IS ACTUALLY

02:57:49.558 --> 02:57:50.826
IT COULDN'T BE FURTHER FROM THE

02:57:50.893 --> 02:57:52.728
TRUTH -- AND REALLY I THINK

02:57:52.795 --> 02:57:54.363
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE FATAL FLAW

02:57:54.430 --> 02:57:55.898
WITH THE BILL -- KAISER

02:57:55.965 --> 02:57:57.633
PERMANENTE A I'M STILL IS VERY

02:57:57.700 --> 02:57:59.869
UNIQUE -- AND I THINK THIS

02:57:59.935 --> 02:58:01.303
DEMONSTRATES KND OF A LACK OF

02:58:01.370 --> 02:58:02.905
UNDERSTANDING WITH OUR MODEL WE

02:58:02.972 --> 02:58:04.206
ARE AT THE KAISER FOUNDATION

02:58:04.273 --> 02:58:05.374
HEALTH PLAN THE KAISER

02:58:05.441 --> 02:58:06.942
FOUNDATION HOSPITAL.

02:58:07.009 --> 02:58:07.977
AND THE PERMANENTE MEDICAL

02:58:08.044 --> 02:58:10.446
GROUPS TOGETHER IN ONE SYSTEM

02:58:10.513 --> 02:58:12.048
THERE'S AN EXCLUSIVE CONTRACTING

02:58:12.114 --> 02:58:13.682
RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT IN THAT

02:58:13.749 --> 02:58:15.484
SYSTEM AND THOSE ENTITIES WORK

02:58:15.551 --> 02:58:17.586
SEAMLESSLY TO PROVIDE CARE FOR

02:58:17.653 --> 02:58:19.088
IT FOUR NINE MILLION MEMBERS.

02:58:19.155 --> 02:58:21.223
OUR MODEL IS INTEGRATED IN EVERY

02:58:21.290 --> 02:58:22.925
WAY NOT JUST CLINICALLY BUT

02:58:22.992 --> 02:58:24.960
FINANCIALLY ELECTRONICALLY

02:58:25.027 --> 02:58:27.129
ADMINISTRATIVELY GOVERNANCE AT

02:58:27.196 --> 02:58:28.030
CETERA.

02:58:28.097 --> 02:58:32.068
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE KAISER

02:58:32.134 --> 02:58:33.436
PERMANENTE A PERIOD.

02:58:33.502 --> 02:58:34.203
JUST BECAUSE KAISER FILE SOME

02:58:34.270 --> 02:58:35.104
INFORMATION DIFFERENTLY WITH OUR

02:58:35.171 --> 02:58:36.772
REGULATORS THAT DOESN'T MEAN

02:58:36.839 --> 02:58:37.840
THAT THAT INFORMATION IS

02:58:37.907 --> 02:58:40.109
INCOMPLETE OR INFERIOR IT IS

02:58:40.176 --> 02:58:41.410
DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE ARE

02:58:41.477 --> 02:58:42.311
DIFFERENT.

02:58:42.378 --> 02:58:44.013
AND I DO HAVE TO QUARREL WITH

02:58:44.080 --> 02:58:46.048
THE THE CHARACTERIZATION I WAS

02:58:46.115 --> 02:58:48.851
ACTUALLY AROUND WHEN -- SB

02:58:48.918 --> 02:58:49.452
ELEVEN SIXTY THREE WAS MOVING

02:58:49.518 --> 02:58:50.653
THROUGH AND WE DID NEGOTIATE

02:58:50.719 --> 02:58:52.988
THAT LANGUAGE -- AND IT WAS VERY

02:58:53.055 --> 02:58:54.623
CLEAR THAT THAT WAS AN

02:58:54.690 --> 02:58:56.358
ACCOMMODATION FOR US ON THE

02:58:56.425 --> 02:58:57.993
HEALTH PLAN REPORTING SIDE TO BE

02:58:58.060 --> 02:59:00.729
ABLE TO COMPLY IN AN ACCURATE

02:59:00.796 --> 02:59:02.965
WAY WITH REPORTING ARE COST

02:59:03.032 --> 02:59:03.699
TREND.

02:59:03.766 --> 02:59:05.134
BECAUSE WE ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE

02:59:05.201 --> 02:59:06.969
OF OUR INTEGRATED MODEL WHEN IT

02:59:07.036 --> 02:59:08.304
COMES TO CALCULATING TREND WE

02:59:08.370 --> 02:59:09.772
JUST DO IT DIFFERENTLY THAN

02:59:09.839 --> 02:59:11.974
OTHER PLANS AND WE WHEN WE BUY

02:59:12.041 --> 02:59:14.443
CARE WE BY KAREN YOU IN NOT IN

02:59:14.510 --> 02:59:16.512
UNITS AND SEGMENTS WE ACTUALLY

02:59:16.579 --> 02:59:19.281
BY CARE -- ON A POPULATION BASIS

02:59:19.348 --> 02:59:21.750
A TOTAL COST OF CARE BASIS OF

02:59:21.817 --> 02:59:24.086
GLOBAL BUDGET BASIS -- OUR COST

02:59:24.153 --> 02:59:25.621
STRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT AND SO

02:59:25.688 --> 02:59:27.723
BECAUSE OF THAT IT IS DIFFICULT

02:59:27.790 --> 02:59:29.892
FOR US TO SLICE AND DICE INTO

02:59:29.959 --> 02:59:32.495
THOSE SEGMENTS -- BACK.

02:59:32.561 --> 02:59:34.163
THE LENO BILL CALLED FOR IN SO

02:59:34.230 --> 02:59:35.598
WE SIMPLY ASK.

02:59:35.664 --> 02:59:37.133
FOR A VERY SMALL PROVISION THAT

02:59:37.199 --> 02:59:39.168
IS A AN ACCOMMODATION FOR US SO

02:59:39.235 --> 02:59:40.836
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FILE IN A

02:59:40.903 --> 02:59:42.471
WAY THAT IS AN HONEST AND

02:59:42.538 --> 02:59:44.240
ACCURATE REFLECTION.

02:59:44.306 --> 02:59:46.308
OF OUR MODEL SO IT'S IT'S IT'S

02:59:46.375 --> 02:59:47.877
COMPLETELY INACCURATE TO SAY

02:59:47.943 --> 02:59:49.445
THAT WE PLAY BY DIFFERENT RULES

02:59:49.512 --> 02:59:50.946
WHEN IT COMES TO THE RATE REVIEW

02:59:51.013 --> 02:59:52.481
WE GO THROUGH THE SAME.

02:59:52.548 --> 02:59:53.983
VERY RIGOROUS RATE REVIEW

02:59:54.049 --> 02:59:55.918
PROCESS -- THAT EVERY OTHER

02:59:55.985 --> 02:59:57.620
HEALTH PLAN DOES AND I WILL ALSO

02:59:57.686 --> 02:59:58.621
CORAL THAT THE PRIOR

02:59:58.687 --> 03:00:00.156
ADMINISTRATION THEN LET US GET

03:00:00.222 --> 03:00:01.957
AWAY WITH ANYTHING SO I THINK

03:00:02.024 --> 03:00:02.858
THAT IS AN UNFORTUNATE MIS

03:00:02.925 --> 03:00:05.461
CHARACTERIZATION OF OF THE THE

03:00:05.528 --> 03:00:07.029
PRIOR IN ACTUALLY CURRENT

03:00:07.096 --> 03:00:08.964
LEADERSHIP OF THAT DEPARTMENT --

03:00:09.031 --> 03:00:10.332
WE GO THROUGH A VERY RIGOROUS

03:00:10.399 --> 03:00:11.867
PROCESS OVER THERE AND AND WE'RE

03:00:11.934 --> 03:00:13.669
NOT EXEMPT -- WE JUST SIMPLY

03:00:13.736 --> 03:00:15.704
SHOW ONE PART OF OUR RATE

03:00:15.771 --> 03:00:16.539
SUBMISSION A LITTLE BIT

03:00:16.605 --> 03:00:18.774
DIFFERENTLY -- THAN OTHER PLANS

03:00:18.841 --> 03:00:20.643
BUT WE ARE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH

03:00:20.709 --> 03:00:22.444
THAT -- I WANT TO SPEND A LITTLE

03:00:22.511 --> 03:00:23.746
BIT MORE TIME ON THE HOSPITAL

03:00:23.812 --> 03:00:25.114
PART OF THE BILL THAT THE

03:00:25.181 --> 03:00:26.348
SUPPORTERS DIDN'T REALLY FOCUS

03:00:26.415 --> 03:00:27.616
ON THAT AND THAT'S FRANKLY THE

03:00:27.683 --> 03:00:28.651
MORE PROBLEMATIC.

03:00:28.717 --> 03:00:32.721
PORTION OF THE BILL -- AGAIN

03:00:32.788 --> 03:00:34.190
THEY THE LANGUAGE IT'S IN THAT

03:00:34.256 --> 03:00:35.357
STATUTE WHEN IT COMES TO

03:00:35.424 --> 03:00:35.958
REPORTING TOSH POT IS NOT AN

03:00:36.025 --> 03:00:37.193
EXEMPTION WE FILE ALL OF THE

03:00:37.259 --> 03:00:38.527
SAME ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY

03:00:38.594 --> 03:00:39.662
QUARTERLY REPORTS AS OUR

03:00:39.728 --> 03:00:40.896
HOSPITAL COLLEAGUES.

03:00:40.963 --> 03:00:42.164
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND

03:00:42.231 --> 03:00:43.399
THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE AND

03:00:43.465 --> 03:00:45.234
THAT'S BECAUSE KAISER FOUNDATION

03:00:45.301 --> 03:00:46.335
HOSPITALS ARE ORGANIZED

03:00:46.402 --> 03:00:47.670
DIFFERENTLY THAN ANY OTHER

03:00:47.736 --> 03:00:49.338
HOSPITAL AND THAT'S BECAUSE

03:00:49.405 --> 03:00:50.439
THAT'S HOW WE STARTED IN

03:00:50.506 --> 03:00:52.241
CALIFORNIA DECADES AGO THAT'S

03:00:52.308 --> 03:00:53.409
HOW WE GREW UP.

03:00:53.475 --> 03:00:56.045
WE HAVE THIRTY SIX HOSPITALS INCALIFORNIA.

03:00:56.111 --> 03:00:58.180
AND THEY ARE OWNED AND OPERATED

03:00:58.247 --> 03:00:59.782
BY THE REGIONAL K. FH

03:00:59.848 --> 03:01:01.050
ORGANIZATION THEY ARE NOT

03:01:01.116 --> 03:01:02.918
INDIVIDUAL STANDALONE FINANCIAL

03:01:02.985 --> 03:01:04.620
ENTITIES AND SO SOME OF THE

03:01:04.687 --> 03:01:05.955
INFORMATION THAT THIS BILL WOULD

03:01:06.021 --> 03:01:07.056
ACTUALLY REQUIRE.

03:01:07.122 --> 03:01:08.357
REQUIRE US TO SUBMIT

03:01:08.424 --> 03:01:09.992
SPECIFICALLY THAT THE FINANCIAL

03:01:10.059 --> 03:01:12.394
INFORMATION -- THE BALLOT SHEET

03:01:12.461 --> 03:01:13.262
THE INCOME STATEMENT THE

03:01:13.329 --> 03:01:14.763
STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW THAT

03:01:14.830 --> 03:01:16.565
DOESN'T EXIST AT THE FACILITY

03:01:16.632 --> 03:01:18.367
LEVEL IT JUST DOESN'T OUR

03:01:18.434 --> 03:01:21.303
INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALS ARE ASSETS

03:01:21.370 --> 03:01:23.172
OF THE REGIONAL ORGANIZATION.

03:01:23.239 --> 03:01:24.240
SO WE ACTUALLY DO FILE A

03:01:24.306 --> 03:01:25.541
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

03:01:25.608 --> 03:01:26.875
INFORMATION IN THE OCCUPIED

03:01:26.942 --> 03:01:28.611
REPORTING AT THE FACILITY BASIS

03:01:28.677 --> 03:01:30.546
AND WE'RE TRYING TO BE ABLE TO

03:01:30.613 --> 03:01:32.681
DO. TO DO MORE AND TO BE MORE

03:01:32.748 --> 03:01:34.116
TRANSPARENT IN THAT SPACE

03:01:34.183 --> 03:01:35.117
BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IT'S

03:01:35.184 --> 03:01:37.019
IMPORTANT BUT WITH RESPECT TO

03:01:37.086 --> 03:01:38.354
THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE

03:01:38.420 --> 03:01:39.455
INFORMATION.

03:01:39.521 --> 03:01:41.156
LITERALLY DOESN'T EXIST AND SO

03:01:41.223 --> 03:01:43.359
WE FILE -- THE CONSOLIDATED

03:01:43.425 --> 03:01:46.428
REPORT -- AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL

03:01:46.495 --> 03:01:47.763
SO.

03:01:47.830 --> 03:01:49.031
I I THINK AT THE MEMBERS IN BOTH

03:01:49.098 --> 03:01:49.665
OF THESE THESE LAWS AGAIN IT'S

03:01:49.732 --> 03:01:51.467
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT

03:01:51.533 --> 03:01:53.135
WHAT WE SEND IS THE TRUTH.

03:01:53.202 --> 03:01:55.504
IT IS AN HONEST AT AN ACCURATE

03:01:55.571 --> 03:01:57.206
REFLECTION OF OF OUR OUR

03:01:57.273 --> 03:01:59.575
OPERATING MODEL IN AND HOW WE DO

03:01:59.642 --> 03:02:01.143
BUSINESS IRONICALLY.

03:02:01.210 --> 03:02:02.911
THIS BILL WILL ACTUALLY IS

03:02:02.978 --> 03:02:04.113
ACTUALLY ASKING US TO BE LESS

03:02:04.179 --> 03:02:06.048
TRANSPARENT TO ACTUALLY OBSCURE

03:02:06.115 --> 03:02:08.684
THE TRUTH AND CANGE THE STORY

03:02:08.751 --> 03:02:10.753
THAT IS THE STORY AND AND SPEND

03:02:10.819 --> 03:02:12.321
A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY DOING IT.

03:02:12.388 --> 03:02:13.689
UP FOR FOR WHAT PURPOSE WERE

03:02:13.756 --> 03:02:15.958
WERE NOT CLEAR WE WOULD ACTUALLY

03:02:16.025 --> 03:02:18.294
PREFER TO SPEND MONEY ON ON

03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:21.597
HEALTH CARE -- INSTEAD OF ON

03:02:21.664 --> 03:02:23.232
ADMINISTRATION.

03:02:23.299 --> 03:02:24.767
MY FINAL THOUGHT -- MEMBERS BUT

03:02:24.833 --> 03:02:26.268
BESIDES SORT OF THE THE NUTS AND

03:02:26.335 --> 03:02:28.270
BOLTS CONCERN OF THE BILL I

03:02:28.337 --> 03:02:30.472
THINK WHAT WHAT FRUSTRATES US

03:02:30.539 --> 03:02:31.607
ABOUT THE BILL IS.

03:02:31.674 --> 03:02:33.175
THAT IT REALLY IS TAKING THE LAW

03:02:33.242 --> 03:02:35.711
BACKWARDS AND AND HEALTH CARE

03:02:35.778 --> 03:02:37.579
EXPERTS HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR

03:02:37.646 --> 03:02:38.981
YEARS AND SENATOR PANDAS HAVE A

03:02:39.048 --> 03:02:40.849
HEARING ON THIS WE NEED TO

03:02:40.916 --> 03:02:42.618
ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO

03:02:42.685 --> 03:02:44.320
CHANGE AND TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM

03:02:44.386 --> 03:02:45.387
INTO.

03:02:45.454 --> 03:02:47.690
A VALUE BASED SYSTEM AND NOT A

03:02:47.756 --> 03:02:50.225
VOLUME BASED SYSTEM -- WE WANT

03:02:50.292 --> 03:02:51.927

03:02:51.994 --> 03:02:53.562
LITTLE BIT BIGGER EXPAND OUR

03:02:53.629 --> 03:02:55.397
THINKING A LITTLE BIT AND SO HOW

03:02:55.464 --> 03:02:57.633
DO WE USE THE STATUTE INSTEAD OF

03:02:57.700 --> 03:02:59.601
GOING BACKWARDS AND TINKERING

03:02:59.668 --> 03:03:00.536
WITH.

03:03:00.602 --> 03:03:02.104
A TEN YEAR OLD LAW HOW DO WE

03:03:02.171 --> 03:03:03.238
ACTUALLY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:03:03.305 --> 03:03:05.274
ASPIRATIONAL HOW DO WE LOOK AT

03:03:05.341 --> 03:03:07.743
THE STATUTE AND SEE HOW WE CAN.

03:03:07.810 --> 03:03:10.479
REUSE POLICY TO LEVERAGE THE

03:03:10.546 --> 03:03:12.314
KIND OF CHANGE WE WANT TO SEE IN

03:03:12.381 --> 03:03:13.782
OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO REALLY

03:03:13.849 --> 03:03:17.119
REWARD AND INCENTIVIZE THE KIND

03:03:17.186 --> 03:03:19.154
OF OF A FINANCIAL ALIGNMENT THAT

03:03:19.221 --> 03:03:20.422
WE WANT TO SEE TO CREATE THAT.

IT IS IT IS SO BUT AND WHAT

03:04:52.314 --> 03:04:54.149
WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH THIS BILL

HOW MUCH YOU'RE SPENDING ON

03:05:12.935 --> 03:05:15.137
RADIOLOGY VERSUS WHAT YOU'RE

03:05:15.204 --> 03:05:17.339

AND I APPRECIATE THE ALL KINDS

03:05:28.317 --> 03:05:29.852
THAT'S WELL KNOWN WE NEGOTIATE

03:05:29.918 --> 03:05:30.986
WITH SOMEBODY WE CAN ACTUALLY

03:05:31.053 --> 03:05:32.187
HEAR THEM LOT MORE DETAILED

03:05:32.254 --> 03:05:33.422
INFORMATION.

03:05:33.489 --> 03:05:35.257
AND AND THEY DO AND AND I THINK

03:05:35.324 --> 03:05:37.626
IT'S IMPORTANT -- BUT WHAT WE

03:05:37.693 --> 03:05:39.795
DON'T GET AND I WOULD POINT OUT

03:05:39.862 --> 03:05:41.263
THAT FOR EXAMPLE I SAID MORE

03:05:41.330 --> 03:05:42.397
GRANULARITY AND I APPRECIATE NO

03:05:42.464 --> 03:05:44.132
MORE WORK WITH KAISER ABOUT THIS.

03:05:44.199 --> 03:05:45.834
BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE HOSPITALS

03:05:45.901 --> 03:05:46.835
AND I I UNDERSTAND YOU GOT YOU

03:05:46.902 --> 03:05:49.104
KNOW WHAT AND TAX ID NUMBER

03:05:49.171 --> 03:05:50.172
SOMETHING FOR THE WHOLE THING

03:05:50.239 --> 03:05:51.139
BUT IT'S ALL OF NORTHERN

03:05:51.206 --> 03:05:52.774
CALIFORNIA NOW TELL YOU KAISER'S

03:05:52.841 --> 03:05:54.209
BIG IN SACRAMENTO IT'S BIG IN

03:05:54.276 --> 03:05:55.244
THE BAY AREA.

03:05:55.310 --> 03:05:56.812
THEY'RE ENTIRELY EVERY THEIR

03:05:56.879 --> 03:05:57.880
CLOTHES BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT

03:05:57.946 --> 03:05:58.680
HEALTHCARE MARKETS AFFECT EVEN

03:05:58.747 --> 03:06:00.549
COVERED CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

03:06:00.616 --> 03:06:01.917
THINGS CARVE TELL DIFFERENTLY

03:06:01.984 --> 03:06:02.150
RIGHT.

03:06:02.217 --> 03:06:03.452
SO THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS IS WE

03:06:03.519 --> 03:06:04.653
DON'T HAVE ALL WE HAVE IS ALL OF

03:06:04.720 --> 03:06:06.221
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU DON'T

03:06:06.288 --> 03:06:07.990
KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON BUT

03:06:08.056 --> 03:06:10.025
LIKE IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT

03:06:10.092 --> 03:06:10.626
THE PEOPLE SHOULD RUNNING THE

03:06:10.692 --> 03:06:11.226
SYSTEM.

03:06:11.293 --> 03:06:12.794
GO OH YEAH WELL WE REALLY DON'T

03:06:12.861 --> 03:06:14.162
KNOW HOW MUCH IS GOING ON THE

03:06:14.229 --> 03:06:15.230
SACRAMENTO SIDE OF THINGS VERSUS

03:06:15.297 --> 03:06:16.365
THE BAY AREA SIDE OF THINGS

03:06:16.431 --> 03:06:18.133
VERSUS THE YOU KNOW WHATEVER

03:06:18.200 --> 03:06:19.034
OTHER.

03:06:19.101 --> 03:06:21.036
AREAS THEY HAVE IN THAT AND AND

03:06:21.103 --> 03:06:24.139
THAT THAT THAT PUZZLES ME A BIT.

03:06:24.206 --> 03:06:25.941
THERE TOO SO I THINK WE NEED TO

03:06:26.008 --> 03:06:28.076
HAVE A LOT MORE GRANULARITY SO

03:06:28.143 --> 03:06:30.279
WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON

03:06:30.345 --> 03:06:31.280
FOR THE REGULATORS RIGHT OF IT

03:06:31.346 --> 03:06:37.686
ALL IN ON CALIFORNIA'S THE SAME.

03:06:37.753 --> 03:06:40.188
I THINK THAT'S A BIT.

03:06:40.255 --> 03:06:41.123
DIFFICULT YEAH THAT THAT THAT.

03:06:41.189 --> 03:06:43.158
DOESN'T SOUND CREDIBLE SO -- SO

03:06:43.225 --> 03:06:44.259
I THINK WE WILL WE WE NEED TO WE

03:06:44.326 --> 03:06:44.860
WE NEED TO HAVE MORE

03:06:44.927 --> 03:06:46.828
TRANSPARENCY -- WE ARE

03:06:46.895 --> 03:06:47.429
REGULATORS THE YOU KNOW WHAT'S

03:06:47.496 --> 03:06:48.864
GOING ON I THINK OUR PURCHASERS

03:06:48.931 --> 03:06:50.365
NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

03:06:50.432 --> 03:06:51.934
FRANKLY HAVE A KAISER HAD AND I

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:53.368
AGREE KAISER HAS A GREAT YOU

03:06:53.435 --> 03:06:54.002
KNOW WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE BASS

03:06:54.069 --> 03:06:54.770
PURCHASING WE HAVE AN INTEGRATED

03:06:54.836 --> 03:06:55.571
MODEL -- BUT THERE'S ALSO OTHER

03:06:55.637 --> 03:06:57.873
INTEGRATED MODELS AS WELL AND WE

03:06:57.940 --> 03:07:00.509
EXPECT THEM TO REPORT AND ART

03:07:00.576 --> 03:07:01.743
EXACTLY SEEMS KAISER NO.

03:07:01.810 --> 03:07:03.879
BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF THE KIND

03:07:03.946 --> 03:07:05.547
OF THINGS ARE ASKING THE REPORT --

03:07:05.614 --> 03:07:06.982
I'D ANYTHING KAISER CAN DO A LOT

03:07:07.049 --> 03:07:09.885
MORE THAN THEY'RE DOING NOW AND

03:07:09.952 --> 03:07:11.553
BECAUSE IF NOTHING ELSE I'M SURE

03:07:11.620 --> 03:07:12.521
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO

03:07:12.588 --> 03:07:16.191
THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO RUN THEIR

03:07:16.258 --> 03:07:17.292
SYSTEM.

03:07:17.359 --> 03:07:18.260
THANK YOU -- AND THE REASON I

03:07:18.327 --> 03:07:19.494
WAS ASKING OUT IS THAT -- YOU

03:07:19.561 --> 03:07:20.429
KNOW BECAUSE I HEAR THAT THEY

03:07:20.495 --> 03:07:21.964
HAVE A CARVE OUT. FOR THEM.

03:07:22.030 --> 03:07:24.166
AND I'M HEARING FROM YOU THAT

03:07:24.232 --> 03:07:26.568
THERE'S OTHERS MOM THE OTHER --

03:07:26.635 --> 03:07:28.070
HOSPITALS THAT HAVE INTEGRATED

03:07:28.136 --> 03:07:29.605
MODELS MAYBE NOT IN THE SAME WAY

03:07:29.671 --> 03:07:32.307
BUT I THINK IT BOILS DOWN -- TO

03:07:32.374 --> 03:07:34.643
TRANSPARENCY ISSUE AND AND

03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:36.545
HAVING EQUITY -- AND IN THE

03:07:36.612 --> 03:07:38.814
MARKET AND SELL I JUST WANT TO

03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:42.884
JUST HEAR FROM -- FROM KAISER.

03:07:42.951 --> 03:07:43.485
THEN I UNDERSTAND AND I HEARD

03:07:43.552 --> 03:07:44.987
YOU SAY THIS IS A TEN YEAR MODEL

03:07:45.053 --> 03:07:46.321
I'M SORRY LAW THAT YOU'VE BEEN

03:07:46.388 --> 03:07:49.091
WORKING ON I JUST WANT TO HEAR.

03:07:49.157 --> 03:07:51.660
IF -- IT MAY BE COMPLICATED IS

03:07:51.727 --> 03:07:54.730
IT TIME THAT YOU NEED TO TRY AND

03:07:54.796 --> 03:07:57.032
COMPLY WITH THIS.

03:07:57.099 --> 03:07:57.933
CAN YOU ANSWER THAT THANK YOU

03:07:58.000 --> 03:07:59.501
CENTER WE'VE WE'VE BEEN

03:07:59.568 --> 03:08:00.736
COMPLYING WITH THE LAW TO BE

03:08:00.802 --> 03:08:03.038
CLEAR -- BOTH FLAWS TO MEAN THAT

03:08:03.105 --> 03:08:04.439
THE OCCUPIED THE WHOLE FOR THE

03:08:04.506 --> 03:08:06.008
HOSPITAL REPORTING HAS BEEN IN

03:08:06.074 --> 03:08:07.242
THE LAW FOR DECADES.

03:08:07.309 --> 03:08:08.710
AND OUTPUT HAS NEVER HAD ANY

03:08:08.777 --> 03:08:10.612
ISSUES WITH OUR REPORTS THE RATE

03:08:10.679 --> 03:08:12.581
REVIEW -- PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN

03:08:12.648 --> 03:08:14.282
IN THE LAW FOR FOR TEN YEARS AND

03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:15.617
WE'VE BEEN FULLY COMPLIANT SO I

03:08:15.684 --> 03:08:16.685
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT

03:08:16.752 --> 03:08:19.755
IT A LACK OF COMPLIANCE IT IS

03:08:19.821 --> 03:08:20.555
AGAIN.

03:08:20.622 --> 03:08:21.823
YEAH THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OF

03:08:21.890 --> 03:08:23.492
BLANK BOXES ON A FORM BUT I

03:08:23.558 --> 03:08:25.093
WOULD SUBMIT THAT THAT'S A FLAW

03:08:25.160 --> 03:08:27.162
IN THE FORM AND NOT WITH OUR

03:08:27.229 --> 03:08:29.564
REPORT SO.

03:08:29.631 --> 03:08:31.433
SO AND I THINK JUST IT TO TO

03:08:31.500 --> 03:08:33.035
KIND OF GRAB ONTO YOUR ACTUALLY

03:08:33.101 --> 03:08:33.802
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.

03:08:33.869 --> 03:08:35.771
IS THERE MORE THAT WE CAN DO IN

03:08:35.837 --> 03:08:37.372
EITHER OF THESE PROBABLY --

03:08:37.439 --> 03:08:39.074
WE'VE DONE A LOT IN THE LAST TEN

03:08:39.141 --> 03:08:41.309
YEARS WE'RE REALLY -- MAKING

03:08:41.376 --> 03:08:42.944
GREAT STRIDES WHEN IT COMES TO

03:08:43.011 --> 03:08:44.479
TRANSPARENCY IT HAS NOT BEEN OUR

03:08:44.546 --> 03:08:45.981
STRONG SUIT IT HASN'T BEEN AND

03:08:46.048 --> 03:08:47.115
PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF OUR

03:08:47.182 --> 03:08:48.583
MODEL WE ARE SO TIGHTLY

03:08:48.650 --> 03:08:49.518
INTEGRATED.

03:08:49.584 --> 03:08:51.253
AND BECAUSE WE DO LOOK AT THE

03:08:51.319 --> 03:08:53.055
TOTAL COST O CARE OUR COST

03:08:53.121 --> 03:08:53.922
STRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT OUR

03:08:53.989 --> 03:08:55.123
BUDGETING IS DIFFERENT WHICH IS

03:08:55.190 --> 03:08:55.891
DIFFERENT.

03:08:55.957 --> 03:08:58.160
BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE

03:08:58.226 --> 03:09:00.328
MARKET AND ARE PURCHASERS -- OUR

03:09:00.395 --> 03:09:02.030
LARGE GROUP PURCHASERS ARE ARE

03:09:02.097 --> 03:09:03.665
LARGE YOU KNOW CALPERS AND COVER

03:09:03.732 --> 03:09:05.200
COME HAVE BEEN PUSHING US THEY

03:09:05.267 --> 03:09:07.102
WANT TO UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT'S

03:09:07.169 --> 03:09:08.670
UNDER THE HOOD WHAT'S DRIVING MY

03:09:08.737 --> 03:09:10.372
RATES WHAT IS YOU KNOW HELP US

03:09:10.439 --> 03:09:11.940
UNDERSTAND AND SO WE UNDERSTAND

03:09:12.007 --> 03:09:13.408
THE MARKET IS IS IS PUSHING US

03:09:13.475 --> 03:09:15.310
ON THAT -- WE ALSO UNDERSTAND

03:09:15.377 --> 03:09:16.845
THAT THERE'S VALUE IN THESE

03:09:16.912 --> 03:09:18.914
REPORTS TO RUN REGULATORS SO.

03:09:18.980 --> 03:09:20.582
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE --

03:09:20.649 --> 03:09:22.317
THERE'S THERE'S SOME INFORMATION

03:09:22.384 --> 03:09:23.418
IN HERE AS I MENTIONED WITH

03:09:23.485 --> 03:09:24.286
RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL

03:09:24.352 --> 03:09:26.488
STATEMENTS THAT WE CAN'T DO

03:09:26.555 --> 03:09:28.123
BECAUSE OF THAT THE STRUCTURE OF

03:09:28.190 --> 03:09:30.625
OUR OSPITAL SYSTEM.

03:09:30.692 --> 03:09:31.259
SO.

03:09:31.326 --> 03:09:32.627
THERE MAY BE THINGS WE CAN DO TO

03:09:32.694 --> 03:09:32.961
IT.

03:09:33.028 --> 03:09:35.030
TO YOU KNOW BUT AGAIN.

03:09:35.097 --> 03:09:36.998
AS WE START SLICING AND DICING I

03:09:37.065 --> 03:09:38.333
WANTED HER TO GET BACK TO IS

03:09:38.400 --> 03:09:40.502
THAT REALLY WHERE WE WANT TO GO

03:09:40.569 --> 03:09:42.137
WITH WITH POLICY.

03:09:42.204 --> 03:09:43.405
DON'T WE WANT TO REALLY LOOK AT

03:09:43.472 --> 03:09:45.107
THAT GLOBAL BUDGET BECAUSE WHEN

03:09:45.173 --> 03:09:46.475
IT COMES TO THE HOSPITALS AND I

03:09:46.541 --> 03:09:47.676
THINK DOCTOR PAN WITH WITH ALL

03:09:47.743 --> 03:09:48.944
DUE RESPECT.

03:09:49.010 --> 03:09:49.745
A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

03:09:49.811 --> 03:09:51.213
ABOUT SORT OF IS THE OLD WAY OF

03:09:51.279 --> 03:09:53.315
THINKING ABOUT HOSPITALS MAKING

03:09:53.381 --> 03:09:54.616
DECISIONS BASED ON ON ON

03:09:54.683 --> 03:09:57.619
FINANCES AND MONEY AND VOLUME

03:09:57.686 --> 03:09:59.788
AND HEADS IN BEDS AND AND THAT'S

03:09:59.855 --> 03:10:01.223
WHAT WE WANT TO GET AWAY FROM.

03:10:01.289 --> 03:10:02.791
OUR HOSPITALS THEY DON'T HAVE TO

03:10:02.858 --> 03:10:04.092
WORRY ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE THEY

03:10:04.159 --> 03:10:05.627
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT VOLUME

03:10:05.694 --> 03:10:06.928
THERE ONLY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING

03:10:06.995 --> 03:10:08.497
GOOD CARE AND IT'S ACTUALLY IN

03:10:08.563 --> 03:10:10.632
PART. TO THE FOLKS THAT THE

03:10:10.699 --> 03:10:12.868
SPONSOR REPRESENTS WE HAVE GREAT

03:10:12.934 --> 03:10:13.702
HEALTH CARE TEAMS THAT ARE

03:10:13.769 --> 03:10:14.669
BETTER.

03:10:14.736 --> 03:10:16.605
KNOCKING THOSE QUALITY SCORES --

03:10:16.671 --> 03:10:18.774
OFF THE CHART BUT THAT'S BECAUSE

03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:20.976
THEY'RE NOT FOCUSED ON WHETHER

03:10:21.042 --> 03:10:22.744
THEY'RE GONNA MAKE BUDGET THIS

03:10:22.811 --> 03:10:24.179
YEAR THOUGH I I WOULD ASSERT

03:10:24.246 --> 03:10:25.180
THAT THAT'S THE DIRECTION WE

03:10:25.247 --> 03:10:27.415
WANT TO TAKE HEALTHCARE AND GO.

03:10:27.482 --> 03:10:28.917
TO LOOKING FOR OUTCOMES AND

03:10:28.984 --> 03:10:31.653
VALUE AND QUALITY -- INSTEAD OF

03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:33.488
WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

03:10:33.555 --> 03:10:35.223
SAY TODAY.

03:10:35.290 --> 03:10:36.324
WELL.

03:10:36.391 --> 03:10:37.425
CAN I JUST SAY ONE BECAUSE OF AN

03:10:37.492 --> 03:10:38.160
EVER SAID THAT KAISER WAS

03:10:38.226 --> 03:10:39.327
VIOLATING THE LAW THE REASON

03:10:39.394 --> 03:10:40.729
WE'RE HERE AND DOING A BILL IS

03:10:40.796 --> 03:10:42.497
BECAUSE OF LAW AS IT CURRENTLY

03:10:42.564 --> 03:10:43.298
IS IS NOT.

03:10:43.365 --> 03:10:45.734
ACHIEVING THE RESULTS THAT WE

03:10:45.801 --> 03:10:47.903
DESIRE TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY.

03:10:47.969 --> 03:10:49.271
I WAS GONNA ADD TO THAT --

03:10:49.337 --> 03:10:49.871
BECAUSE I THINK YOU

03:10:49.938 --> 03:10:50.806
MISUNDERSTOOD MY QUESTION I

03:10:50.872 --> 03:10:52.174
WASN'T IMPLYING BY ANY MEANS

03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:54.075
THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN

03:10:54.142 --> 03:10:59.047
COMPLAINING THE LAST TEN YEARS I

03:10:59.114 --> 03:10:59.214
DO.

03:10:59.281 --> 03:11:00.348
THAT.

03:11:00.415 --> 03:11:01.183
CLEARLY YOU USED TO REPORTING IN

03:11:01.249 --> 03:11:02.918
A CERTAIN WAY WHICH IS THE LONG.

03:11:02.984 --> 03:11:03.652
AND THE NOW WITH THE CHANGES

03:11:03.718 --> 03:11:05.320
THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT

03:11:05.387 --> 03:11:06.188
HERE IN THIS SITE LEGISLATION I

03:11:06.254 --> 03:11:07.155
WAS TRYING TO SEE WE CAN.

03:11:07.222 --> 03:11:08.957
BRIDGE THE GAP TO ALLOW YOU AT

03:11:09.024 --> 03:11:10.792
LEAST TIME IF THAT'S WHAT YOU

03:11:10.859 --> 03:11:11.893
NEEDED.

03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:13.361
TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO -- BUT

03:11:13.428 --> 03:11:14.429
I DID HEAR YOU JUST SAY RIGHT

03:11:14.496 --> 03:11:15.630
NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT CONCERNED

03:11:15.697 --> 03:11:16.898
WITH THE BOTTOM LINE HOWEVER I

03:11:16.965 --> 03:11:18.433
HEARD YOU JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO

03:11:18.500 --> 03:11:19.367
THAT.

03:11:19.434 --> 03:11:20.936
THAT YOU CAN DO IT BUT IT WAS

03:11:21.002 --> 03:11:21.937
GOING TO COST A LOT OF MONEY AND

03:11:22.003 --> 03:11:23.738
YOU WHAT RATHER USE THAT MONEY

03:11:23.805 --> 03:11:25.841
TOWARDS HEALTH CARE SO THERE IS

03:11:25.907 --> 03:11:26.608
SOME CONCERN WITH THE BOTTOM

03:11:26.675 --> 03:11:28.243
LINE -- BUT AGAIN I WAS JUST

03:11:28.310 --> 03:11:29.477
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

03:11:29.544 --> 03:11:30.545
BRIDGE THAT GAP SO THAT.

03:11:30.612 --> 03:11:31.613
AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS

03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:32.948
LEGISLATION YOU WOULD HAVE THAT

03:11:33.014 --> 03:11:35.250
TIME OR TRY TO WORK WITH YOU TO

03:11:35.317 --> 03:11:36.918
TO MAKE SURE THAT.

03:11:36.985 --> 03:11:38.720
THEY'RE SUFFICIENT TIME BUT I

03:11:38.787 --> 03:11:40.755
NOT SURE THAT TIME IS WHAT YOU

03:11:40.822 --> 03:11:43.291
NEED -- BUT THANK YOU THAT

03:11:43.358 --> 03:11:45.594
ANSWERS MY QUESTION THANK YOU

03:11:45.660 --> 03:11:46.428
DOCTOR SENATOR MITCHELL.

03:11:46.494 --> 03:11:50.599
THANK YOU -- THIS IS COMPLEX.

03:11:50.665 --> 03:11:51.867
AND I THINK KAISER IS A UNIQUE

03:11:51.933 --> 03:11:53.668
ANIMAL.

03:11:53.735 --> 03:11:57.639
AND I THINK -- YOU KNOW THE

03:11:57.706 --> 03:11:58.840
OLDER SAY TO MOLD THE CREATIVE

03:11:58.907 --> 03:12:01.142
THE WHOLE HMO MODEL WE RECOGNIZE

03:12:01.209 --> 03:12:03.612
THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENT KIND

03:12:03.678 --> 03:12:04.880
OF MOTIVATION YOUR BUSINESS.

03:12:04.946 --> 03:12:06.014
IT'S BEEN A WE GET THAT BUT

03:12:06.081 --> 03:12:07.048
THERE'S A DIFFERENT.

03:12:07.115 --> 03:12:09.718
KIND OF MOTIVATION IN TERMS OF

03:12:09.784 --> 03:12:11.386
PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES AND

03:12:11.453 --> 03:12:13.154
THAT OTHER HOSPITALS DON'T

03:12:13.221 --> 03:12:14.956
NECESSARILY HALF AND SO I GET

03:12:15.023 --> 03:12:17.158
THAT AND SO WHEN I STRUGGLE WITH

03:12:17.225 --> 03:12:19.594
THIS EXPECTATION PERHAPS ON OUR

03:12:19.661 --> 03:12:21.029
IN.

03:12:21.096 --> 03:12:22.063
THAT THERE WOULD BE THAT THERE

03:12:22.130 --> 03:12:24.266
EVEN CAN BE AN APPLE TO APPLE

03:12:24.332 --> 03:12:26.334
COMPARISON FOR REGULATORS I

03:12:26.401 --> 03:12:28.036
WONDER HOW REALISTIC THAT THAT

03:12:28.103 --> 03:12:29.004
IS.

03:12:29.070 --> 03:12:31.273
AND AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO

03:12:31.339 --> 03:12:32.607
DRIVE TO AN APPLES TO APPLES

03:12:32.674 --> 03:12:35.443
COMPARISON. TO GET TO THE ROOT

03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:39.314
ISSUE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING. TO

03:12:39.381 --> 03:12:41.249
TO TO FIX OR IDENTIFY -- THE

03:12:41.316 --> 03:12:42.684
KAISER WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOUR

03:12:42.751 --> 03:12:44.286
REGIONAL YOU KNOW HOW MANY

03:12:44.352 --> 03:12:46.321
HOSPITALS ARE PER REGION IS IT

03:12:46.388 --> 03:12:46.821
LIKE.

03:12:46.888 --> 03:12:50.025
DOCTOR PAN SAID THAT THAT THAT

03:12:50.091 --> 03:12:52.460
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CHI CHI'S IN

03:12:52.527 --> 03:12:54.129
NORTH IS EVERY HOSPITAL IN

03:12:54.195 --> 03:12:55.463
KAISER NORTH YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU

03:12:55.530 --> 03:12:57.065
DEFINE YOUR REGION'S BECAUSE OF

03:12:57.132 --> 03:12:58.166
THE REGIONS ARE.

03:12:58.233 --> 03:13:00.135
SMALL ENOUGH THERE ARE FEWER

03:13:00.201 --> 03:13:01.603
ENOUGH HOSPITALS IN IT.

03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:03.204
WHILE IT WON'T BE AN APPLES TO

03:13:03.271 --> 03:13:04.539
APPLES COMPARISON IT MAY BE

03:13:04.606 --> 03:13:06.574
EASIER TO EXTRAPOLATE THE KIND

03:13:06.641 --> 03:13:07.475
OF DATA.

03:13:07.542 --> 03:13:09.444
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SO HOW

03:13:09.511 --> 03:13:10.845
MANY HOSPITALS PER REGION YEAH

03:13:10.912 --> 03:13:12.347
IT SO THERE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

03:13:12.414 --> 03:13:13.715
REGION IN SOUTHERN CAL IS ALL

03:13:13.782 --> 03:13:15.750
ONE WRONG SO BUT AGAIN BUT

03:13:15.817 --> 03:13:17.585
THAT'S THE LEGAL STRUCTURE.

03:13:17.652 --> 03:13:19.321
K. FH NOR RIGHT OWNS THE

03:13:19.387 --> 03:13:20.855
HOSPITALS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

03:13:20.922 --> 03:13:23.458
RIGHT THEY ARE ONE THEY ARE THAT

03:13:23.525 --> 03:13:24.859
THEY ARE THE ASSETS OF KAISER

03:13:24.926 --> 03:13:26.828
FOUNDATION HOSPITAL THEY'RE NOT

03:13:26.895 --> 03:13:27.929
STANDALONE FINANCIAL AND I GET

03:13:27.996 --> 03:13:28.997
YOUR THE I GET IS RIGHT.

03:13:29.064 --> 03:13:30.365
SO I THINK IN INTO YOUR POINT

03:13:30.432 --> 03:13:31.299
ABOUT THE APPLES TO APPLES

03:13:31.366 --> 03:13:32.667
COMPARISON I THINK YOU REALLY

03:13:32.734 --> 03:13:34.169
HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD BECAUSE

03:13:34.235 --> 03:13:36.004
I THINK IT IS MISLEADING. TO SAY

03:13:36.071 --> 03:13:37.839
THAT THERE CAN BE AN APPLES TO

03:13:37.906 --> 03:13:39.941
APPLES COMPARISON HERE BECAUSE

03:13:40.008 --> 03:13:41.543
WE'RE NOT AN APPLE I GET IT

03:13:41.609 --> 03:13:42.510
WE'RE ACTUALLY MORE LIKE AN

03:13:42.577 --> 03:13:45.480
APPLE PIE ACTUALLY HIT -- BUT

03:13:45.547 --> 03:13:53.321
SERIOUSLY BECAUSE YEAH GIVE

03:13:53.388 --> 03:13:55.223
THOUGH THE GOAL.

03:13:55.290 --> 03:13:55.991
WHAT TO DROUGHT WITH THAT GIVEN

03:13:56.057 --> 03:13:57.258
THE UNDERLYING MOTIVATING FACTOR

03:13:57.325 --> 03:13:58.393
WHICH IS TO GET HAVE A SENSE OF

03:13:58.460 --> 03:13:59.427
HOW WE MEASURE [inaudible]

03:13:59.494 --> 03:14:00.895
COST.

03:14:00.962 --> 03:14:02.097
IT MAY NOT BE AN APPLES TO

03:14:02.163 --> 03:14:02.897
APPLES BUT BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE

03:14:02.964 --> 03:14:03.965
A RESPONSIBILITY TO KIND OF PLAY

03:14:04.032 --> 03:14:05.033
IN THE SANDBOX IN TERMS OF

03:14:05.100 --> 03:14:06.868
SHEDDING SOME LIGHT. TO THE

03:14:06.935 --> 03:14:10.071
REGULATORS ABOUT WHAT INFORMS

03:14:10.138 --> 03:14:12.307
YOUR DECISION MAKING AROUND HOW

03:14:12.374 --> 03:14:14.943
YOUR COSTS ARE.

03:14:15.010 --> 03:14:17.912
DECLARED AND SO IF NOT THIS WAY

03:14:17.979 --> 03:14:20.181
THEN WHAT YEAH NO I THINK ON THE

03:14:20.248 --> 03:14:23.485
ON THE COST CHARGE REVENUE SIDE

03:14:23.551 --> 03:14:24.753
YEAH I THINK THERE'S THERE'S

03:14:24.819 --> 03:14:26.888
ROOM THERE FOR US TO TALK MORE

03:14:26.955 --> 03:14:28.556
ABOUT HOW WE CAN REPORT THAT IN

03:14:28.623 --> 03:14:29.891
A MORE GRANULAR BASIS.

03:14:29.958 --> 03:14:31.393
THAT IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO

03:14:31.459 --> 03:14:32.227
AGAIN AND THAT WAS MY POINT

03:14:32.293 --> 03:14:34.262
ABOUT WE WOULD NEED TO INVEST

03:14:34.329 --> 03:14:35.997
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND AND

03:14:36.064 --> 03:14:36.865
HIRE.

03:14:36.931 --> 03:14:38.233
ACCOUNTANTS AND ACTUARIES IN

03:14:38.299 --> 03:14:39.367
ORDER TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT

03:14:39.434 --> 03:14:41.269
REALLY IS REVAMPING ITS

03:14:41.336 --> 03:14:43.505
REVAMPING OUR ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS

03:14:43.571 --> 03:14:45.040
BUT IT'S IT'S DOABLE.

03:14:45.106 --> 03:14:46.408
ON THAT I I THINK I WANT TO GO

03:14:46.474 --> 03:14:48.309
BACK TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

03:14:48.376 --> 03:14:49.044
THAT.

03:14:49.110 --> 03:14:51.179
AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE OWNERSHIP

03:14:51.246 --> 03:14:53.415
OF THE HOSPITALS THAT

03:14:53.481 --> 03:14:54.182
INFORMATION JUST.

03:14:54.249 --> 03:14:54.849
DOESN'T EXIST AND WE DON'T WANNA

03:14:54.916 --> 03:14:56.618
MAKE IT UP SO I THINK THERE IS

03:14:56.684 --> 03:14:58.887
ROOM TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT AND

03:14:58.953 --> 03:14:59.754
OPEN.

03:14:59.821 --> 03:15:02.057
ABOUT THE THE REVENUE AND AND

03:15:02.123 --> 03:15:04.459
CHARGE ASPECT OF IT WHEN WE CAN

03:15:04.526 --> 03:15:05.460
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND THE

03:15:05.527 --> 03:15:07.395
LET'S GET CLEAR ABOUT WHY THAT'S

03:15:07.462 --> 03:15:09.697
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE A HOW.

03:15:09.764 --> 03:15:11.499
MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S MEDI CAL

03:15:11.566 --> 03:15:13.601
BENEFICIARIES ARE KAISER

03:15:13.668 --> 03:15:15.670
PATIENTS I MEAN I THINK THE THE

03:15:15.737 --> 03:15:17.739
THE ROLE WE PLAY IN IT IS GIVEN

03:15:17.806 --> 03:15:19.441
THE SHEER VOLUME OF STATE

03:15:19.507 --> 03:15:21.409
DOLLARS.

03:15:21.476 --> 03:15:23.578
THAT ARE FUNNELED THROUGH.

03:15:23.645 --> 03:15:24.212
NORTH OR SOUTH OF ME SO THAT'S

03:15:24.279 --> 03:15:25.747
WHY WE'RE IN THE CONVERSATION

03:15:25.814 --> 03:15:27.015
GENERALLY.

03:15:27.082 --> 03:15:28.316
AND I AND I WOULD ASSUME IN ALL

03:15:28.383 --> 03:15:29.884
FAIRNESS THE OTHER HOSPITALS

03:15:29.951 --> 03:15:30.919
EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE TO

03:15:30.985 --> 03:15:33.521
CHANGE YOUR SYSTEM ALSO HAVE TO

03:15:33.588 --> 03:15:36.024
HAVE PERSONNEL IN PLACE. TO

03:15:36.091 --> 03:15:38.259
ADHERE TO ALL OF THE REGULATORS

03:15:38.326 --> 03:15:39.961
IN ALL THE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT

03:15:40.028 --> 03:15:42.130
ALL OF OUR ASK -- FOR SO IN

03:15:42.197 --> 03:15:44.165
FAIRNESS SHINGLES ACOSTA BORN

03:15:44.232 --> 03:15:47.669
ALL BE THEY DIFFERENT -- IN IN

03:15:47.735 --> 03:15:50.872
THE OTHER HOSPITAL SYSTEMS -- TO

03:15:50.939 --> 03:15:52.307
AND I WOULD VENTURE TO ASSUME

03:15:52.373 --> 03:15:53.641
THAT WITHOUT A VEHICLE GOING

03:15:53.708 --> 03:15:55.910
THROUGH.

03:15:55.977 --> 03:16:00.448
THE THE CONVERSATION -- WOULDN'T --

03:16:00.515 --> 03:16:01.583
HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF

03:16:01.649 --> 03:16:02.951
MOTIVATION.

03:16:03.017 --> 03:16:04.819
AS IF THERE WERE NOT INTERFERE

03:16:04.886 --> 03:16:06.387
TODAY YEAH IN TERMS OF THESE

03:16:06.454 --> 03:16:08.523
REPORTS PROBABLY BUT AGAIN AS AS

03:16:08.590 --> 03:16:11.092
I STATED YOU KNOW TRANSPARENCY

03:16:11.159 --> 03:16:12.327
IN WANTING TO UNDERSTAND MORE

03:16:12.393 --> 03:16:13.928
WHAT WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD IS IS

03:16:13.995 --> 03:16:14.562
A IS.

03:16:14.629 --> 03:16:16.731
A CONVERSATION ARE PURCHASERS

03:16:16.798 --> 03:16:19.367
ARE WANTING OF US APPROPRIATELY --

03:16:19.434 --> 03:16:21.236
AND WE'VE WE'VE MADE A LOT OF

03:16:21.302 --> 03:16:22.237
INVESTMENTS AND WE'RE GOING TO

03:16:22.303 --> 03:16:23.771
CONTINUE TO DO MORE ABOUT THAT

03:16:23.838 --> 03:16:26.007
SO I THINK THAT IS CHANGING US

03:16:26.074 --> 03:16:27.742
INTERNALLY A LITTLE BIT WE WANT

03:16:27.809 --> 03:16:28.877
TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THAT

03:16:28.943 --> 03:16:31.880
BUT YEAH THIS THIS BILL IS IS.

03:16:31.946 --> 03:16:33.014
ADDITIONALLY CHALLENGING RIGHT

03:16:33.081 --> 03:16:35.950
SO LET ME SAY DOCTOR PAN THAT

03:16:36.017 --> 03:16:38.553
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY

03:16:38.620 --> 03:16:39.454
YOU KNOW HOW WE LIKE TO DO THESE

03:16:39.521 --> 03:16:40.955
CABBIE OUT MOST SUPPORTED TODAY.

03:16:41.022 --> 03:16:43.825
BUT I DO THINK IT IS FAIR TO

03:16:43.892 --> 03:16:45.793
WITH KNOWLEDGE THE KAISER HE IS

03:16:45.860 --> 03:16:48.163
A DIFFERENT ANIMAL AND THAT

03:16:48.229 --> 03:16:50.331
ISN'T TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S BAD.

03:16:50.398 --> 03:16:50.999
THEY WERE THE FIRST THEY CREATED

03:16:51.065 --> 03:16:52.867
A CERTAIN MODEL BUT MANY HAVE

03:16:52.934 --> 03:16:55.203
FOLLOWED -- AND SO I THINK WE DO

03:16:55.270 --> 03:16:57.005
HAVE TO WORK TO FIGURE OUT HOW

03:16:57.071 --> 03:17:01.142
WE GET TO THE REAL CRUX OF THE

03:17:01.209 --> 03:17:02.844
QUESTION.

03:17:02.911 --> 03:17:04.379
IN ALL AND AN APPLES TO APPLES.

03:17:04.445 --> 03:17:05.013
I DON'T THINK IT'S A FAIR

03:17:05.079 --> 03:17:07.382
EXPECTATION OF IT IF THERE IS A

03:17:07.448 --> 03:17:09.083
WAY TO GET THERE -- AND I

03:17:09.150 --> 03:17:10.218
BELIEVE THE VEHICLES PROBABLY

03:17:10.285 --> 03:17:12.187
NECESSARY TO MOVE THE

03:17:12.253 --> 03:17:13.755
CONVERSATION ALONG WHICH IS WHY

03:17:13.821 --> 03:17:15.256
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT -- BUT

03:17:15.323 --> 03:17:17.659
BUT I THINK THAT THAT WE NEED TO

03:17:17.725 --> 03:17:21.429
ALSO BE FAIR IN TERMS OF IT MAY

03:17:21.496 --> 03:17:23.998
NOT LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER

03:17:24.065 --> 03:17:26.367
HOSPITAL APPLES -- BUT HOW DO WE

03:17:26.434 --> 03:17:28.236
GET TO THE CRUX THE CORE ISSUES

03:17:28.303 --> 03:17:30.371
THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR OUR

03:17:30.438 --> 03:17:32.173
ABILITY TO MANAGE AND PROVIDE

03:17:32.240 --> 03:17:34.676
OVERSIGHT.

03:17:34.742 --> 03:17:36.444
IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN DO THAT.

03:17:36.511 --> 03:17:37.745
IN THE MAY I JUST SAY ACTUALLY I

03:17:37.812 --> 03:17:38.813
AM FULL AGREEMENT WITH YOU

03:17:38.880 --> 03:17:40.481
CENTER I TO CHILL AND WHILE THE

03:17:40.548 --> 03:17:42.517
BILL IS IN ITS CURRENT FORM

03:17:42.584 --> 03:17:44.619
WE'RE STILL WAITING TO HAVE.

03:17:44.686 --> 03:17:46.087
THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE YOU'RE

03:17:46.154 --> 03:17:47.188
RIGHT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN

03:17:47.255 --> 03:17:48.656
APPLE THE APPLE BUT IT'S GOT TO

03:17:48.723 --> 03:17:49.457
BE.

03:17:49.524 --> 03:17:50.725
BASICALLY WE HAVE TO GET THE

03:17:50.792 --> 03:17:52.527
KIND OF DATA WE NEED TO ACHIEVE

03:17:52.594 --> 03:17:54.429
OUR GOALS SO I UNDERSTAND MAY BE

03:17:54.495 --> 03:17:57.465
SIMILAR NOT IDENTICAL GIVEN THE

03:17:57.532 --> 03:17:58.199
STRUCTURE.

03:17:58.266 --> 03:18:00.401
BUT WE BUT THAT IDEA THAT WELL

BLANK AND IT'S ALL ROLLED UP

03:18:06.207 --> 03:18:08.309
INTO ONE NUMBER.

03:18:08.376 --> 03:18:09.811
ISN'T ENOUGH PLANET GRANULARITY

03:18:09.877 --> 03:18:10.612

OF AT LEAST INITIALLY LE

03:18:12.380 --> 03:18:13.648
CONVERSATIONS WITH TRYING TO

03:18:13.715 --> 03:18:14.115
FIGURE OUT.

03:18:14.182 --> 03:18:15.483
IF THERE CAN BE SOME KIND OF

03:18:15.550 --> 03:18:18.987
AGREEMENT ON WHAT -- THE SHARED

03:18:19.053 --> 03:18:20.822

03:18:43.177 --> 03:18:44.646
POINT OF FRUSTRATION FOR US AT

03:18:44.712 --> 03:18:45.913
THE BARGAINING TABLE.

03:18:45.980 --> 03:18:48.383
BECAUSE WE COULD NEVER GET TO

03:18:48.449 --> 03:18:51.119
THE ROOT OF HEALTH ACTUALLY

03:18:51.185 --> 03:18:53.221

OUR EXPERIENCE RATE WE KNEW

03:19:11.806 --> 03:19:13.041
WHERE THE COST INCREASES ARE

03:19:13.107 --> 03:19:14.742
COMING FROM.

03:19:14.809 --> 03:19:17.111
BUT WE NEVER KNEW WITH KAISER SO

03:19:17.178 --> 03:19:21.883
I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- ONE

03:19:21.949 --> 03:19:23.117
I WOULD THINK THAT YOU HAVE A

03:19:23.184 --> 03:19:25.086
TEAM THAT PROCESSES CLAIMS.

03:19:25.153 --> 03:19:27.555
AND THEY WOULD ENCOUNTER DATA.

03:19:27.622 --> 03:19:30.224
COULD THEY NOT USE THAT DATA OR

03:19:30.291 --> 03:19:32.927
USE THOSE CLAIMS TO EXTRAPOLATE

03:19:32.994 --> 03:19:34.429
OUT HOW MUCH IT COSTS FOR

03:19:34.495 --> 03:19:35.430
CERTAIN.

03:19:35.496 --> 03:19:37.031
VISITS AND CERTAIN THINGS THAT

03:19:37.098 --> 03:19:38.666
HAPPEN [inaudible]

03:19:38.733 --> 03:19:40.234
SO ACTUALLY.

03:19:40.301 --> 03:19:42.170
THAT'S NOT TRUE WE BEGIN DON'T

03:19:42.236 --> 03:19:43.604
HAVE A CLAIMS DEPARTMENT PAID

03:19:43.671 --> 03:19:46.341
WHAT WE DO NOW BECAUSE SOME OF

03:19:46.407 --> 03:19:47.575
OUR OUTSIDE SERVICES ARE CLAIMS

03:19:47.642 --> 03:19:50.078
BASED RIGHT BUT OUR MODEL.

03:19:50.144 --> 03:19:52.313
THE THE CORE STRUCTURE OF HOW WE

03:19:52.380 --> 03:19:55.216
FUNCTION IS IS A PREPAID RISK

03:19:55.283 --> 03:19:57.985
BASED SYSTEM RIGHT SO THAT SO

03:19:58.052 --> 03:19:59.320
IT'S A PM PM.

03:19:59.387 --> 03:20:00.655
THERE ARE NO CLAIMS ARE OUR

03:20:00.722 --> 03:20:03.491
PHYSICIANS DON'T BILL THE HEALTH

03:20:03.558 --> 03:20:05.393
PLAN THE HOSPITALS DON'T BILL

03:20:05.460 --> 03:20:06.928
THE HEALTH PLAN IT IT'S IT'S

03:20:06.994 --> 03:20:07.995
IT'S THAT SORT OF TOTAL TOTAL%

03:20:08.062 --> 03:20:09.731
COST O CARE BUDGET RIGHT.

03:20:09.797 --> 03:20:11.366
BUT HAVING SAID THAT AGAIN THE

03:20:11.432 --> 03:20:13.234
CLAIMS DATA IS WHERE THE

03:20:13.301 --> 03:20:15.536
TRANSPARENCY COMES FROM AND WHAT

03:20:15.603 --> 03:20:17.205
OUR PURCHASERS WANT TO SEE AND

03:20:17.271 --> 03:20:19.273
SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY AGAIN

03:20:19.340 --> 03:20:21.109
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN WORK

03:20:21.175 --> 03:20:23.978
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS -- TO TO

03:20:24.045 --> 03:20:25.613
CREATE THAT CLAIMS DATA WERE

03:20:25.680 --> 03:20:26.881
ACTUALLY.

03:20:26.948 --> 03:20:28.683
MANUFACTURING THE CLAIMS DATA

03:20:28.750 --> 03:20:29.784
WHICH IS WHICH IS THE THE

03:20:29.851 --> 03:20:31.619
ENCOUNTER DATA TIMES PRICE RIGHT

03:20:31.686 --> 03:20:32.620
WHICH IS REALLY WHAT IT IS SO

03:20:32.687 --> 03:20:34.455
WE'VE ACTUALLY WORKED SO HARD TO

03:20:34.522 --> 03:20:35.723
SAY THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT HOW WE

03:20:35.790 --> 03:20:36.691
DO IT.

03:20:36.758 --> 03:20:38.426
WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING THAT THAT

03:20:38.493 --> 03:20:39.160
THAT.

03:20:39.227 --> 03:20:40.995
TOTAL COST OF CARE APPROACH BUT

03:20:41.062 --> 03:20:42.263
BECAUSE IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO

03:20:42.330 --> 03:20:44.298
CALPERS AND OUR LABOR TRUSTS AND

03:20:44.365 --> 03:20:46.300
OUR OUR PUBLIC SECTOR PURCHASERS

03:20:46.367 --> 03:20:48.302
WE ARE CREATING THAT DATA FOR

03:20:48.369 --> 03:20:50.004
THEM SO THEY CAN SEE THAT --

03:20:50.071 --> 03:20:51.572
IMPORTANTLY PROTECTING MEMBERS

03:20:51.639 --> 03:20:54.208
PRIVACY -- WHILE WE'RE DOING

03:20:54.275 --> 03:20:55.143
THAT BUT WE CAN ACTUALLY SHOW

03:20:55.209 --> 03:20:56.444
THE UTILIZATION AND AND THE

03:20:56.511 --> 03:20:58.012
ENCOUNTER INFORMATION NOW AND SO

03:20:58.079 --> 03:20:59.747
THAT'S A BIG IMPROVEMENT WE WE

03:20:59.814 --> 03:21:03.017
WELCOME YOU TO COME BACK IN AND

03:21:03.084 --> 03:21:03.651
CHECK IT OUT WHEN I DON'T KNOW.

03:21:03.718 --> 03:21:04.585
THOSE.

03:21:04.652 --> 03:21:05.586
DAYS ARE OVER THANK YOU.

03:21:05.653 --> 03:21:07.355
OKAY SO I WANT TO UNDERSTAND I

03:21:07.422 --> 03:21:09.791
HAVE A PPO SO I GO TO MY DOCTOR

03:21:09.857 --> 03:21:11.692
AND I HAVE A CHECK UP AND HE

03:21:11.759 --> 03:21:12.927
SAYS -- CONNIE WE WANT TO CHECK

03:21:12.994 --> 03:21:15.096
YOUR LIVER FUNCTION WALKED DOWN

03:21:15.163 --> 03:21:16.697
THE HALL AND LET'S DO A SONOGRAM

03:21:16.764 --> 03:21:18.399
GREAT WE DO THAT THEN HE SAYS --

03:21:18.466 --> 03:21:19.300
WALK ACROSS THE HALL AND WE'RE

03:21:19.367 --> 03:21:21.035
DRAW SOME BLOOD WORK OKAY GREAT

03:21:21.102 --> 03:21:22.069
SO WE DO THAT WHEN I GET MY

03:21:22.136 --> 03:21:23.171
STATEMENT.

03:21:23.237 --> 03:21:25.206
IT SHOWS ME ITEMIZED WHAT I HAD

03:21:25.273 --> 03:21:28.509
DONE WHAT THE COST WAS NOW MY

03:21:28.576 --> 03:21:30.711
MOTHER IN LAW JOSEPHINE WHO HAS

03:21:30.778 --> 03:21:32.180
KAISER AND MY HUSBAND I

03:21:32.246 --> 03:21:33.581
SOMETIMES TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR.

03:21:33.648 --> 03:21:35.183
THE SAME THING HAPPENS TO HER

03:21:35.249 --> 03:21:37.585
AND SHE GOES IN AND HE HAS HER

03:21:37.652 --> 03:21:43.524
PHYSICAL AND THEN HE SAYS ALL

03:21:43.591 --> 03:21:44.158
YOU KNOW WHAT JOSEPHINE WE WANT

03:21:44.225 --> 03:21:45.827
TO CHECK -- Là -- FUNCTION GO

03:21:45.893 --> 03:21:46.961
DOWN THE HALL WE WANT TO CHECK

03:21:47.028 --> 03:21:47.829
YOU TAKE SOME BLOOD GO ACROSS

03:21:47.895 --> 03:21:48.095
THE HALL.

03:21:48.162 --> 03:21:50.398
WHEN SHE GETS A BILL IT'S NOT

03:21:50.465 --> 03:21:51.532
ITEMIZED BUT I I THINK I'M JUST

03:21:51.599 --> 03:21:52.533
HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING

03:21:52.600 --> 03:21:53.801
WHAT DOESN'T KAISER HAVE ANY

03:21:53.868 --> 03:21:56.170
IDEA WHAT THAT SONOGRAM COST?

03:21:56.237 --> 03:21:57.672
ANY IDEA WHAT THAT BLOOD WORK

03:21:57.738 --> 03:22:00.475
COST BECAUSE I'M THINKING THAT

03:22:00.541 --> 03:22:02.210
YOU WOULD HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE TO

03:22:02.276 --> 03:22:04.145
DO THE JOB SO AT THE VERY LEAST

03:22:04.212 --> 03:22:05.913
YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT THEIR SALARY

03:22:05.980 --> 03:22:06.814
WAS.

03:22:06.881 --> 03:22:08.816
I JUST THINK YOUR SALARIES OKAY

03:22:08.883 --> 03:22:10.852
BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF

03:22:10.918 --> 03:22:12.887
ACOSTA SIS SO TO MY MOTHER IN

03:22:12.954 --> 03:22:14.055
LAW GOES AND HAS THOSE

03:22:14.121 --> 03:22:15.223
PROCEDURES TO AND THAT WOULD

03:22:15.289 --> 03:22:17.325
COST KAISER X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS

03:22:17.391 --> 03:22:18.326
BECAUSE SHE HAD THREE TWO THAT'S

03:22:18.392 --> 03:22:18.659
REALLY THEM.

03:22:18.726 --> 03:22:20.862
THAT'S THE RISK BEARING SO SO

03:22:20.928 --> 03:22:24.732
THAT THE MEDICAL GROUP FOR

03:22:24.799 --> 03:22:25.199
EXAMPLE.

03:22:25.266 --> 03:22:26.534
MERRILY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF

03:22:26.601 --> 03:22:27.168
THAT CARE EVEN IN OUR HOSPITALS

03:22:27.235 --> 03:22:28.703
RIGHT SO OUR PHYSICIANS PRACTICE

03:22:28.769 --> 03:22:31.205
IN OUR HOSPITALS -- AND AND THAT

03:22:31.272 --> 03:22:32.507
ACTUALLY CREATES EVEN AT A

03:22:32.573 --> 03:22:34.509
TIGHTER AND TIGHTER INTEGRATION

03:22:34.575 --> 03:22:36.043
BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A

03:22:36.110 --> 03:22:38.813
CONTRACT BETWEEN THE PERMANENTE

03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:39.413
MEDICAL GROUPS AND THE HEALTH

03:22:39.480 --> 03:22:39.614
PLAN.

03:22:39.680 --> 03:22:41.215
SUPER SECRET DOCUMENT BUT ALL OF

03:22:41.282 --> 03:22:43.351
THAT IS IS IS IN THAT DOCUMENT

03:22:43.417 --> 03:22:44.685
IT'S IT'S THE CONTRACT IT'S THE

03:22:44.752 --> 03:22:46.220
MEDICAL GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

03:22:46.287 --> 03:22:47.855
ALL OF THESE THINGS.

03:22:47.922 --> 03:22:48.789
YOU'RE GONNA GET THIS AMOUNT PER

03:22:48.856 --> 03:22:50.992
MONTH FOR ALL OF THESE MEMBERS

03:22:51.058 --> 03:22:52.527
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE AS GOOD CARE

03:22:52.593 --> 03:22:54.395
OF THEM AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN IF

03:22:54.462 --> 03:22:55.863
THEY'RE HEALTHY GOOD FOR YOU

03:22:55.930 --> 03:22:57.532
THAT'S UPSIDE RISK IF THEY GET

03:22:57.598 --> 03:22:58.299
SICK.

03:22:58.366 --> 03:22:59.834
BAD FOR YOU THAT'S DOWNSIDE RISK

03:22:59.901 --> 03:23:01.035
AND THAT'S KINDA HOW IT HOW IT

03:23:01.102 --> 03:23:02.036
WORKS FOR US AND WE HAVE

03:23:02.103 --> 03:23:04.171
ACTUALLY REALLY HARNESS THAT

03:23:04.238 --> 03:23:07.141
MODELS IT TO EVEN MAKE IT DIDN'T

03:23:07.208 --> 03:23:09.243
EVEN MAKE IT STRONGER SO.

03:23:09.310 --> 03:23:09.944
THERE AREN'T THERE AREN'T BILLS --

03:23:10.011 --> 03:23:11.445
THEY GO OUT -- FOR THE MOST PART

03:23:11.512 --> 03:23:13.848
IT IT IS IT IS IT IS ALL PREPAID

03:23:13.915 --> 03:23:15.182
AND IT'S A RISK BASED AND REALLY

03:23:15.249 --> 03:23:17.018
THAT THE PATIENT IS NOT INVOLVED

03:23:17.084 --> 03:23:18.152
IN THAT AND I I'VE BEEN A

03:23:18.219 --> 03:23:20.154
BECAUSE REMEMBER. FOR FORTY

03:23:20.221 --> 03:23:21.389
YEARS I'VE NEVER HAD A BILL AND

03:23:21.455 --> 03:23:23.024
AND THAT'S BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S

03:23:23.090 --> 03:23:24.892
IT'S THE FOCUS ON ON THE THE

03:23:24.959 --> 03:23:26.627
OVERALL PERSON -- IN DOING

03:23:26.694 --> 03:23:28.496
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP THAT

03:23:28.563 --> 03:23:29.931
PERSON HEALTHY WHICH IS THAT

03:23:29.997 --> 03:23:32.133
VALUE BASED OUTCOMES BASED

03:23:32.199 --> 03:23:33.968
STRUCTURE THAT WE REALLY THINK

03:23:34.035 --> 03:23:35.436
WE NEED TO BE MOVING TO OKAY SO

03:23:35.503 --> 03:23:37.305
YOU HAVE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE

03:23:37.371 --> 03:23:38.306
HEALTH PLANS RIGHT.

03:23:38.372 --> 03:23:40.608
OKAY SO HOW DO YOU DETERMINE IF

03:23:40.675 --> 03:23:42.109
YOU HAVE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN

03:23:42.176 --> 03:23:45.580
YOU'VE GOT A YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE

03:23:45.646 --> 03:23:47.481
SOME IDEA OF WHAT THE THAT'S WHY

03:23:47.548 --> 03:23:48.115
WE'RE GETTING NOW IS WE HAVEN'T

03:23:48.182 --> 03:23:48.649
ALWAYS HAD HIGH DEDUCTIBLE

03:23:48.716 --> 03:23:49.283
HEALTH PLANS THAT'S A RELATIVELY

03:23:49.350 --> 03:23:50.551
NEW ADDITION TO OR BENEFIT

03:23:50.618 --> 03:23:51.586
PACKAGE.

03:23:51.652 --> 03:23:53.287
BUT AGAIN BECAUSE THE MARKET WAS

03:23:53.354 --> 03:23:55.423
ASKING FOR THAT RIGHT SO FOR

03:23:55.489 --> 03:23:56.724
THAT REASON WE DO TRACK VERY

03:23:56.791 --> 03:23:58.526
CAREFULLY THE SERVICES SO THAT

03:23:58.593 --> 03:24:01.195
WE CAN SET SO THAT WE CAN TRACK --

03:24:01.262 --> 03:24:02.597
THAT THE COST SHARING AND THE

03:24:02.663 --> 03:24:04.398
DEDUCTIBLE AND AND ALL OF THAT

03:24:04.465 --> 03:24:05.900
SO THERE IS THAT THAT TRACKING

03:24:05.967 --> 03:24:08.669
GOING ON AT THE AT THE PEOPLE

03:24:08.736 --> 03:24:11.939
YOU GET IN THERE.

03:24:12.006 --> 03:24:12.573
YEAH GET ME OUT ALL RIGHT WHICH

03:24:12.640 --> 03:24:13.541
WILL GET YOU A LITTLE FARTHER

03:24:13.608 --> 03:24:14.442
ALONG INTERSTATE.

03:24:14.508 --> 03:24:15.710
BECAUSE I JUST I CAN'T EXPRESS

03:24:15.776 --> 03:24:17.111
YOUR MEAN I'VE BEEN GONE FOR

03:24:17.178 --> 03:24:18.346
FOUR YEARS NOW -- I DON'T

03:24:18.412 --> 03:24:19.714
NEGOTIATE THOSE CONTRACTS

03:24:19.780 --> 03:24:20.781
ANYMORE BUT I CAN'T SHARE WITH

03:24:20.848 --> 03:24:22.383
THAT I CAN'T EXPRESS ENOUGH HOW

03:24:22.450 --> 03:24:23.884
FRUSTRATING IT WAS.

03:24:23.951 --> 03:24:26.087
AND HOW HARD IT WAS FOR US TO

03:24:26.153 --> 03:24:27.521
NEGOTIATE BENEFITS FOR OUR

03:24:27.588 --> 03:24:29.357
MEMBERS WITH EMPLOYERS WHO

03:24:29.423 --> 03:24:30.691
DIDN'T WANT TO PAY A DIME

03:24:30.758 --> 03:24:32.827
TOWARDS THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE

03:24:32.893 --> 03:24:34.295
WHEN WE CAN'T WE DON'T HAVE GOOD

03:24:34.362 --> 03:24:36.931
HONEST DATA AND INFORMATION.

03:24:36.998 --> 03:24:38.666
SO THAT WE CAN SAY LOOK KAISER'S

03:24:38.733 --> 03:24:40.401
ACTUALLY BETTER DEAL WHY DON'T

03:24:40.468 --> 03:24:41.502
WE GO TO KAISER -- LOOK BLUE

03:24:41.569 --> 03:24:43.270
CROSS PPO IS ACTUALLY BETTER

03:24:43.337 --> 03:24:44.505
DEAL MAYBE WE SHOULD GO WITH

03:24:44.572 --> 03:24:44.705
THEM.

03:24:44.772 --> 03:24:46.941
IT JUST MAKES IT HARD TO DO

03:24:47.008 --> 03:24:48.609
OTHER IT MAKES IT HARD FOR OTHER

03:24:48.676 --> 03:24:50.578
PEOPLE TO DO THEIR JOBS.

03:24:50.645 --> 03:24:51.212
WHEN YOU CAN'T BREAK DOWN THAT

03:24:51.278 --> 03:24:52.546
DATA I KNOW THAT YOU'RE

03:24:52.613 --> 03:24:54.181
DIFFERENT MODEL BUT I'M HOPING

03:24:54.248 --> 03:24:55.616
THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW

03:24:55.683 --> 03:24:57.418
IMPORTANT THIS IS FOR A WHOLE

03:24:57.485 --> 03:24:58.786
LOT OF PEOPLE AND MAYBE WE CAN

03:24:58.853 --> 03:25:00.054
START FIGURING OUT A WAY TO FIND

03:25:00.121 --> 03:25:01.989
THOSE NUMBERS?

03:25:02.056 --> 03:25:05.393
THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

TO DOING SOMETHING IN A CERTAIN

03:27:30.671 --> 03:27:32.506
WAY IT TAKES LONGER TO GET THERE

HOURS GETTING LATE SO -- FOR THE

03:27:47.421 --> 03:27:50.925
SEIU RAP -- DESI ARE YOU OPPOSE

03:27:50.991 --> 03:27:52.092
THE COMEDY LANGUAGE THAT KAISER

03:27:52.159 --> 03:27:53.894
REQUESTED IN THE ORIGINAL RATE

03:27:53.961 --> 03:27:59.700
REVIEW -- OR ASHKHABAD STATUTE.

03:27:59.767 --> 03:28:04.805
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE -- WE DIDN'T

03:28:04.872 --> 03:28:05.873
OPPOSE THEM.

03:28:05.940 --> 03:28:07.341
AND THAT'S WHY HE DIDN'T OPPOSE

03:28:07.408 --> 03:28:08.475
IT AT THAT TIME AND WELL THE

03:28:08.542 --> 03:28:09.543
ASHRAM LANGUAGE I BELIEVE WAS

03:28:09.610 --> 03:28:11.912
PUT IN PLACE IN THE SEVENTIES OR

03:28:11.979 --> 03:28:13.180
EIGHTIES SO I'M.

03:28:13.247 --> 03:28:14.915

03:28:21.021 --> 03:28:23.390
RATE REVIEW PROCESS LANGUAGE I

03:28:23.457 --> 03:28:25.025
THINK THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION

03:28:25.092 --> 03:28:26.427
THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT'S IN

03:28:26.493 --> 03:28:29.163
STATUTE NOW WOULD HAVE ALLOWED

03:28:29.230 --> 03:28:31.799
KAISER TO DO ITS BEST AND I

03:28:31.866 --> 03:28:33.300
THINK WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE

03:28:33.367 --> 03:28:34.702
WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT'S BEEN

03:28:34.768 --> 03:28:36.704
FILED THE LAST THREE YEARS AND

03:28:36.770 --> 03:28:37.338
RATE REVIEW AND WE'RE SAYING.

03:28:37.404 --> 03:28:39.373
HEISER IS FALLEN FAR SHORT OF

03:28:39.440 --> 03:28:41.442
DOING ITS BEST IN TERMS OF

03:28:41.508 --> 03:28:43.711
WHAT'S IN EXISTING LAW THEY GOT

03:28:43.777 --> 03:28:46.614
A SPECIAL MENTION -- OVER THAT

03:28:46.680 --> 03:28:48.816
TIME THERE'S THEY'VE SUBMITTED

03:28:48.883 --> 03:28:50.751
ONE NUMBER FOR ALL THE SIX

03:28:50.818 --> 03:28:52.052
BENEFIT CATEGORIES THEY WERE

03:28:52.119 --> 03:28:53.754
SUPPOSED TO TRY TO DO THEIR BEST

03:28:53.821 --> 03:28:55.289
TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE SIX BENEFIT

03:28:55.356 --> 03:28:56.557
CATEGORIES TO THE BEST OF THEIR

03:28:56.624 --> 03:28:57.324
ABILITY.

03:28:57.391 --> 03:28:59.426
WE DON'T THINK THAT ONE NUMBER

03:28:59.493 --> 03:29:00.494
FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF

03:29:00.561 --> 03:29:02.196
CALIFORNIA GETS YOU THERE.

03:29:02.263 --> 03:29:04.565
AND THEY'VE -- INCREASED RATES

03:29:04.632 --> 03:29:06.267
EACH OF THOSE YEARS INCLUDING

03:29:06.333 --> 03:29:08.669
THE MOST RECENT FIVE POINT 1%

03:29:08.736 --> 03:29:11.071
RATE INCREASE AGAIN WITH NO

03:29:11.138 --> 03:29:13.974
JUSTIFICATION OTHER THAN THE

03:29:14.041 --> 03:29:15.542
PRICES ARE HIGHER THEY DON'T

03:29:15.609 --> 03:29:16.844
TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

03:29:16.911 --> 03:29:18.879
TERMS OF UTILIZATION AT KAISER.

03:29:18.946 --> 03:29:20.814
AND SO WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS

03:29:20.881 --> 03:29:27.888
THE NEED -- FOR YOU KNOW.

03:29:27.955 --> 03:29:29.089
YES MEAN.

03:29:29.156 --> 03:29:30.557
TESTIFIED VERY WELL TOO YOU KNOW

03:29:30.624 --> 03:29:30.791
THERE.

03:29:30.858 --> 03:29:31.425
MAYBE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SOME

03:29:31.492 --> 03:29:32.059
LAPSES ON THE REGULATORY SIDE

03:29:32.126 --> 03:29:33.160
BUT THERE IS A NEED TO GET

03:29:33.227 --> 03:29:35.329
KAISER TO A PLACE OF EQUAL

03:29:35.396 --> 03:29:37.197
FOOTING WITH WHERE THE REST OF

03:29:37.264 --> 03:29:38.098
THE MARKET IS.

03:29:38.165 --> 03:29:40.234
AND IF THIS YEAR'S RATE INCREASE

03:29:40.301 --> 03:29:43.170
PUTS THE BLUE SHIELD ON AVERAGE

03:29:43.237 --> 03:29:45.072
PRODUCTS 12% TWELVE DOLLARS

03:29:45.139 --> 03:29:46.807
EXCUSE ME LOWER THAN THE KAISER

03:29:46.874 --> 03:29:49.043
PRODUCT ON AVERAGE YOU KNOW.

03:29:49.109 --> 03:29:50.744
IS THAT TWELVE DOLLARS A FACTOR

03:29:50.811 --> 03:29:53.147
OF ALL THOSE OTHER INSURANCE

03:29:53.213 --> 03:29:53.847
PLANS AND ALL THOSE OTHER

03:29:53.914 --> 03:29:55.149
HOSPITALS AND ALL THOSE OTHER

03:29:55.215 --> 03:29:57.584
DOCTORS HAVING TO COMPLY WITH

03:29:57.651 --> 03:30:00.087
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF REGULATION

03:30:00.154 --> 03:30:02.589
AND TRANSPARENCY IT'S IT'S

03:30:02.656 --> 03:30:05.025
SIMPLY NOT FAIR. TO SAY THAT YOU

03:30:05.092 --> 03:30:06.660
DON'T HAVE TO PRODUCE THE SAME

03:30:06.727 --> 03:30:08.095
LEVELS OF INFORMATION AND

03:30:08.162 --> 03:30:10.064
JUSTIFICATION AND THEN YOU CAN

03:30:10.130 --> 03:30:13.000
CHARGE SO SLIGHTLY LOWER RATES

03:30:13.067 --> 03:30:13.901
THAN SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.

03:30:13.968 --> 03:30:15.169
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER AND

03:30:15.235 --> 03:30:17.171

03:30:17.237 --> 03:30:18.238
PRISM OF THE YOU BEEN IN CONTACT

03:30:18.305 --> 03:30:20.240
WITH OCCUPIED -- ABOUT THE BILL

03:30:20.307 --> 03:30:21.909
IN THEIR DATA COLLECTION IF ONLY

FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- WHAT

03:30:24.311 --> 03:30:24.878
ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT WITH THE

03:30:24.945 --> 03:30:25.813
KAISER COULD EVEN PROVIDE THE

03:30:25.879 --> 03:30:29.917
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT THIS

03:30:29.984 --> 03:30:31.352
BILL WOULD -- MANDATE.

03:30:31.418 --> 03:30:34.621
SO -- I I DON'T SPEAK DIRECTLY

03:30:34.688 --> 03:30:35.990
FOR US I SPIED -- BUT THANK THE

03:30:36.056 --> 03:30:37.458
THE ISSUES REALLY WHAT KAISER --

03:30:37.524 --> 03:30:38.792
PROVIDES AND WHAT THEY FILE AND

03:30:38.859 --> 03:30:39.927
I'VE EXAMS ON THE FILINGS AND

03:30:39.994 --> 03:30:41.128
THERE'S A LOT OF WELL BLANKS

03:30:41.195 --> 03:30:42.229
BASICALLY SAYING REFER TO THIS

03:30:42.296 --> 03:30:43.130
ONE NUMBER.

03:30:43.197 --> 03:30:45.099
AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S

03:30:45.165 --> 03:30:53.073
PROBLEMATIC -- AND AND SO -- I I

03:30:53.140 --> 03:30:54.875
DON'T I SPORTS MAINLY.

03:30:54.942 --> 03:30:55.609
I START SELF IS MORE OF A DATA

03:30:55.676 --> 03:30:57.911
COLLECTOR THAN ANYTHING ELSE I

03:30:57.978 --> 03:30:59.413
MEAN I BUT I WOULD SAY IS THAT

03:30:59.480 --> 03:31:01.548
UNFORTUNATELY THE THE LEVEL OF

03:31:01.615 --> 03:31:03.283
GRANULARITY OF INFORMATION WE'RE

03:31:03.350 --> 03:31:06.920
GETTING IS -- IT IS NOT VERY

03:31:06.987 --> 03:31:08.288
HELPFUL OR USEFUL RIGHT WHEN YOU

03:31:08.355 --> 03:31:10.391

03:31:10.457 --> 03:31:12.126
WELL GEE I MEAN I'M IN IN

03:31:12.192 --> 03:31:13.527
SACRAMENTO MARKET I KNOW THIS

03:31:13.594 --> 03:31:14.695
WILL EVEN MULTIPLE HOSPITALS AND

03:31:14.762 --> 03:31:15.729
SECOND I CAN'T.

03:31:15.796 --> 03:31:16.263
PULL OUT WHAT'S GOING ON

03:31:16.330 --> 03:31:18.432
SACRAMENTO VERSES THE BAY AREA

03:31:18.499 --> 03:31:19.466
VERSES.

03:31:19.533 --> 03:31:20.868
AT PRESENT OUR NORTHERN

03:31:20.934 --> 03:31:22.603
CALIFORNIA IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S

03:31:22.669 --> 03:31:23.904
IT THE AND YET YOU KNOW WHAT

03:31:23.971 --> 03:31:25.639
EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL AND I'M NOT

03:31:25.706 --> 03:31:27.207
SAYING YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE

03:31:27.274 --> 03:31:29.243
THE APPLE IT IT'S NOT NOTHING ON

03:31:29.309 --> 03:31:30.110
THE APPLE EXACTLY APPLE APPLE

03:31:30.177 --> 03:31:32.312
BUT WE WE THERE'S A REASON WE

03:31:32.379 --> 03:31:33.547
ASK THOSE OTHER INSTITUTE.

03:31:33.614 --> 03:31:35.215
OTHER HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH

03:31:35.282 --> 03:31:37.151
PLANS FOR INFORMATION AS WELL

03:31:37.217 --> 03:31:39.353
AND SO I THINK THERE IS ALSO AN

03:31:39.420 --> 03:31:40.721
ISSUE OF FAIRNESS THAT COMES OUT

03:31:40.788 --> 03:31:42.256
TO ABOUT WELL WHY DO THEY HAVE.

03:31:42.322 --> 03:31:43.857
TO TELL US STUFF AND KAISER

03:31:43.924 --> 03:31:45.859

03:31:45.926 --> 03:31:47.761
THERE BUT IT BUT MORE

03:31:47.828 --> 03:31:50.264
IMPORTANTLY IT'S IT COMES DOWN --

03:31:50.330 --> 03:31:52.099
TO DO ARE WE GETTING THE KIND OF

03:31:52.166 --> 03:31:53.700
INFORMATION TO REACH THE KIND OF

03:31:53.767 --> 03:31:54.568
GOAL TO WANNA CHIEF FOR OUR

03:31:54.635 --> 03:31:56.070
REGULATORS AND FOR OUR

03:31:56.136 --> 03:31:57.271
PURCHASERS AND FOR THE PEOPLE OF

03:31:57.337 --> 03:31:58.605
CALIFORNIA SO THEY CAN

03:31:58.672 --> 03:32:01.075

PROBABLY MORE WE CAN DO AT A

03:32:45.352 --> 03:32:46.620
MORE GRANULAR GRANULAR LEVEL

03:32:46.687 --> 03:32:48.055
WITH RESPECT TO THE THE CHARGE

OR THE QUARTERLY REPORT -- THAT

03:32:54.962 --> 03:32:57.331

03:32:57.397 --> 03:32:58.966
DO SO I THINK AGAIN YOU KNOW

03:32:59.032 --> 03:32:59.967
IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WE'RE

03:33:00.033 --> 03:33:01.702
WE'RE WILLING TO DO THAT WORK IN

03:33:01.768 --> 03:33:02.436
AND REALLY.

03:33:02.503 --> 03:33:03.770
SORT OF FREAK REVAMP THE

03:33:03.837 --> 03:33:06.006
ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS TO TO

03:33:06.073 --> 03:33:07.508
ALLOCATE THAT AND FIGURE THAT

03:33:07.574 --> 03:33:09.443
OUT FOR THIRTY SIX HOSPITALS YOU

03:33:09.510 --> 03:33:10.144
KNOW INSTEAD OF TWO REPORTS

03:33:10.210 --> 03:33:11.278
THERE WOULD BE THIRTY SIX

03:33:11.345 --> 03:33:12.913
REPORTS THAT'S NOT.

03:33:12.980 --> 03:33:14.581
THIS IS ALL MANUAL ENTRY AND WE

03:33:14.648 --> 03:33:18.986
LOVE OUR SPOT BUT THEIR THEIR

03:33:19.052 --> 03:33:19.820
TECHNICAL PLATFORM IS NOT GREAT --

03:33:19.887 --> 03:33:21.588
SO THAT SO THERE'S AN INVESTMENT

03:33:21.655 --> 03:33:23.257
THERE -- I WOULD SO WE CAN DO IT

03:33:23.323 --> 03:33:25.092
IT'S DOABLE IT WILL BE DIFFICULT

03:33:25.159 --> 03:33:28.128
AND COSTLY -- THAT IS IN IN

03:33:28.195 --> 03:33:30.063
CONTRAST TO THE FINANCIAL

03:33:30.130 --> 03:33:31.665
STATEMENTS -- WHICH THAT THE

03:33:31.732 --> 03:33:33.767
BALANCE SHEET THE INCOME

03:33:33.834 --> 03:33:36.637
STATEMENT -- IS IF YOU REFER TO

03:33:36.703 --> 03:33:37.004
AS THE PANELS.

03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:38.472
THAT AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE LEGAL

03:33:38.539 --> 03:33:39.706
STRUCTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION

03:33:39.773 --> 03:33:41.742
THAT LITERALLY DOESN'T EXIST AT

03:33:41.808 --> 03:33:45.312
THE FACILITY LEVEL.

03:33:45.379 --> 03:33:46.446
SO.

03:33:46.513 --> 03:33:47.481
THE HOSPITALS ARE ASSETS OF

03:33:47.548 --> 03:33:49.483
KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL SO --

03:33:49.550 --> 03:33:50.484
IF IF YOU OWN THREE TV'S IN YOUR

03:33:50.551 --> 03:33:51.418
HOME I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DO BUT

03:33:51.485 --> 03:33:52.753
IF YOU OWN THREE TV'S IN YOUR

03:33:52.819 --> 03:33:53.453
HOME.

03:33:53.520 --> 03:33:55.055
YOU THOSE ARE YOUR ASSETS YOU

03:33:55.122 --> 03:33:57.457
OWN THOSE TV'S THE TV'S.

03:33:57.524 --> 03:33:59.092
ARE INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL

03:33:59.159 --> 03:34:00.694
ENTITIES THAT HAVE THEIR OWN

03:34:00.761 --> 03:34:01.995
ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SO IT.

03:34:02.062 --> 03:34:03.297
IT'S HARD TO KIND OF WRAP YOUR

03:34:03.363 --> 03:34:05.132
MIND AROUND -- ACCOUNTING WAS A

03:34:05.199 --> 03:34:07.868
LONG TIME FOR ME BUT SO WE IF

03:34:07.935 --> 03:34:09.536
THERE'S MORE WE CAN PROVIDE.

03:34:09.603 --> 03:34:10.804
THAT IS THAT IT'S THAT YIELDS

03:34:10.871 --> 03:34:12.139
MEANINGFUL TRANSPARENCY AND

03:34:12.206 --> 03:34:14.141
HELPS TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION

03:34:14.208 --> 03:34:15.242
FORWARD WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO

03:34:15.309 --> 03:34:16.577
DO IT BUT THEY'RE SIMPLY

03:34:16.643 --> 03:34:18.078
INFORMATION THAT THAT IS JUST A

03:34:18.145 --> 03:34:20.247
NON STARTER THAT DOESN'T EXIST.

03:34:20.314 --> 03:34:22.916
SO YOUR ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE FOR

03:34:22.983 --> 03:34:25.686
BASICALLY FOR KAISER I'M SURE

03:34:25.752 --> 03:34:26.353
WAS PROBABLY DESIGNED FOR KAISER

03:34:26.420 --> 03:34:26.787
THAT.

03:34:26.853 --> 03:34:28.255
SENDS ALL THE EXPENSES AND ALL

03:34:28.322 --> 03:34:30.224
THE REVENUES TO ONE FEDERAL TAX

03:34:30.290 --> 03:34:31.458
ID NUMBER AND YOU COME UP WITH

03:34:31.525 --> 03:34:33.727
WHAT THE RATE THAT IS

03:34:33.794 --> 03:34:36.897
IMPLEMENTED. FOR IT FOR YOU TO

03:34:36.964 --> 03:34:37.397
DO WHAT'S BEING OUSTED.

03:34:37.464 --> 03:34:38.198
WHAT IS A FAIR TO THIS TO SAY

03:34:38.265 --> 03:34:39.333
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO HIRE

03:34:39.399 --> 03:34:41.535
FORENSIC ATTORNEY ACCOUNTANTS TO

03:34:41.602 --> 03:34:42.202
COME IN?

03:34:42.269 --> 03:34:45.539
AND TO DISASSOCIATE FROM THE

03:34:45.606 --> 03:34:46.506
MASTER ACCOUNTING.

03:34:46.573 --> 03:34:48.008
OF THE ACCOUNTING RELATED TO

03:34:48.075 --> 03:34:50.410
EACH RESPECTIVE HOSPITAL

03:34:50.477 --> 03:34:51.745
QUESTION ONE QUESTION.

03:34:51.812 --> 03:34:53.247
TWO IS IT FAIR TO SAY WITH YOUR

03:34:53.313 --> 03:34:54.248
THIRTY TWO HOSPITALS SUGGEST

03:34:54.314 --> 03:34:55.315
SOME HOSPITALS THAT ARE MUCH

03:34:55.382 --> 03:34:57.517
MORE PROFITABLE THAN OTHERS AND

03:34:57.584 --> 03:34:58.085
MAYBE SOME OF THE HOSPITAL'S

03:34:58.151 --> 03:34:59.753
ACTUALLY.

03:34:59.820 --> 03:35:00.988
KERRY OTHER HOSPITALS.

03:35:01.054 --> 03:35:02.656
AND IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO SAY

03:35:02.723 --> 03:35:03.857
THAT IF YOU DID THE ACCOUNTING

03:35:03.924 --> 03:35:05.025
OF EACH RESPECTIVE HOSPITAL

03:35:05.092 --> 03:35:06.693
WOULD YOU SEE DIFFERENT RATES A

03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:07.828
COULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

03:35:07.894 --> 03:35:08.929
CERTAIN AREAS.

03:35:08.996 --> 03:35:11.265
AND LESS EXPENSIVE IN OTHER

03:35:11.331 --> 03:35:12.466
AREAS.

03:35:12.532 --> 03:35:13.634
YES SIR TWO TO YOUR FIRST

03:35:13.700 --> 03:35:15.035
QUESTION I I CERTAINLY CAN'T

03:35:15.102 --> 03:35:17.037
SPEAK TO WHO WE WOULD NEED TO

03:35:17.104 --> 03:35:18.739
HIRE AN AND HOW MANY OF THOSE

03:35:18.805 --> 03:35:20.107
PEOPLE WE WOULD NEED TO HIRE I

03:35:20.173 --> 03:35:21.842
DO KNOW THAT THE MY SUBJECT

03:35:21.908 --> 03:35:22.976
MATTER EXPERTS WHO HAVE BEEN

03:35:23.043 --> 03:35:24.244
WORKING WITH ON THIS BILL HAVE

03:35:24.311 --> 03:35:25.112
BEEN VERY.

03:35:25.178 --> 03:35:26.713
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT.

03:35:26.780 --> 03:35:28.348
THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT

03:35:28.415 --> 03:35:30.050
WOULD TAKE FOR US TO ACTUALLY

03:35:30.117 --> 03:35:31.385
YOU KNOW REPORT DECEMBER WEEK WE

03:35:31.451 --> 03:35:33.487
HAVE IT WE CAN DEVELOP BUT A

03:35:33.553 --> 03:35:35.122
METHODOLOGY A SYSTEM TO TO

03:35:35.188 --> 03:35:36.523
REPORT THAT BUT THAT IS NOT A

03:35:36.590 --> 03:35:37.691
SMALL THING.

03:35:37.758 --> 03:35:39.493
I I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW BUT

03:35:39.559 --> 03:35:40.894
AGAIN THE NUMBER OF MILLIONS OF

03:35:40.961 --> 03:35:42.663
DOLLARS WAS WAS THROWN OUT IN

03:35:42.729 --> 03:35:44.264
AND I WILL ADMIT WE HAVE NOT.

03:35:44.331 --> 03:35:46.033
SAT AND DONE THAT YOU KNOW VERY

03:35:46.099 --> 03:35:48.302
CAREFUL MATH -- BUT IT WOULD BE

03:35:48.368 --> 03:35:50.070
A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND IT

03:35:50.137 --> 03:35:51.204
MIGHT BE WORTH IT THERE MIGHT BE

03:35:51.271 --> 03:35:53.006
VALUE IN THAT INVESTMENT BASED

03:35:53.073 --> 03:35:56.743
ON ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY --

03:35:56.810 --> 03:35:57.778
WITH RESPECT.

03:35:57.844 --> 03:35:58.512
TO HOSPITALS THAT ARE MORE

03:35:58.578 --> 03:35:59.579
PROFITABLE IN THERE THAT THAT'S

03:35:59.646 --> 03:36:01.848
JUST NOT HOW WE THINK -- CAR OUR

03:36:01.915 --> 03:36:04.518
HOSPITALS ARE ACTUALLY BEING

03:36:04.584 --> 03:36:05.385
FORCED TO THINK THAT WAY WELL WE

03:36:05.452 --> 03:36:07.421
THINK IN A WAY WHERE I THE FACT

03:36:07.487 --> 03:36:08.689
THAT OUR HOSPITALS ARE ARE ARE

03:36:08.755 --> 03:36:10.023
ESSENTIALLY ONE ENTITY IS

03:36:10.090 --> 03:36:11.291
ACTUALLY A GOOD THING WHEN IT

03:36:11.358 --> 03:36:12.526
COMES TO COSTS WHEN IT COMES TO

03:36:12.592 --> 03:36:14.861
QUALITY SO FOR INSTANCE.

03:36:14.928 --> 03:36:16.063
KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL

03:36:16.129 --> 03:36:17.998
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY BY ALL

03:36:18.065 --> 03:36:19.166
OF THE DRUGS.

03:36:19.232 --> 03:36:20.867
RIGHT SO WE KNOWTHE ISSUES WITH

03:36:20.934 --> 03:36:22.502
WITH PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING WE

03:36:22.569 --> 03:36:27.374
HER UP A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT --

03:36:27.441 --> 03:36:28.575
BUYING EQUIPMENT WHEN YOU'RE

03:36:28.642 --> 03:36:30.644
BUYING MATERIAL WE'RE NOT JUST

03:36:30.711 --> 03:36:32.179
ONE HOSPITAL YOU KNOW BUYING

03:36:32.245 --> 03:36:34.014
THESE THINGS WE ARE LEVERAGING

03:36:34.081 --> 03:36:35.716
THE SIZE OF THE ORGANIZATION AND

03:36:35.782 --> 03:36:37.484
ACTUALLY THAT'S CREATING VALUE

03:36:37.551 --> 03:36:38.852
AND EFFICIENCIES AND KEEPING

03:36:38.919 --> 03:36:40.354
PRICES LOW.

03:36:40.420 --> 03:36:42.356
SO I DON'T THE I DON'T THINK WE

03:36:42.422 --> 03:36:43.423
EVEN HAVE LOW PERFORMING

03:36:43.490 --> 03:36:44.791
HOSPITALS IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU

03:36:44.858 --> 03:36:46.960
HOW YOU DEFINE THAT THE QUALITY

03:36:47.027 --> 03:36:47.928
SCORES REALLY SPEAK FOR

03:36:47.994 --> 03:36:50.063
THEMSELVES THE QUALITY SCORES

03:36:50.130 --> 03:36:51.732

HOSPITALS AND AND AND PLAN HERE

03:36:55.335 --> 03:36:57.104
IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S I THINK

03:36:57.170 --> 03:36:58.338
HOW WHAT WE HAVE TO BE LOOKING

03:36:58.405 --> 03:37:00.173
AT IS IS THE QUALITY.

03:37:00.240 --> 03:37:03.210

BEING USED.

03:38:15.682 --> 03:38:16.917
SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF

03:38:16.983 --> 03:38:18.752
INFORMATION IN ORDER TO RUN THE

03:38:18.819 --> 03:38:20.153
ORGANIZATION.

03:38:20.220 --> 03:38:22.756
OKAY SO YES ALL HOSPITALS MAY BE

03:38:24.458 --> 03:38:26.693
SURE THEY MUST HAVE AN

03:38:26.760 --> 03:38:27.294
UNDERSTANDING.

03:38:27.360 --> 03:38:29.963
OF FOR EACH HOSPITAL WHAT

THEY'RE SPENDING HOW MUCH HOW

03:38:31.431 --> 03:38:32.532
MANY PATIENTS ARE IN THERE HOW

03:38:32.599 --> 03:38:34.668
MUCH THEY'RE SPENDING PER BED

03:38:34.734 --> 03:38:36.336
ICU BED OTHER TYPES OF THINGS

03:38:36.403 --> 03:38:37.904
AND YET IN THE REPORT.

03:38:37.971 --> 03:38:38.905
EVEN FOR ALL THE NORTHERN

I I DO THINK THAT IS.

03:38:45.879 --> 03:38:48.448
A BIG PROBLEM I APPRECIATE THE

03:38:48.515 --> 03:38:49.716
THE CENTER LEYVA YOU ASKED YOU

03:38:49.783 --> 03:38:51.318
YOU MENTIONED ABOUT HIGH

03:38:51.384 --> 03:38:53.053
DEDUCTIBLE PLANS WELL SOMEBODY

03:38:53.119 --> 03:38:53.887
HAD TO COME UP WITH THE

03:38:53.954 --> 03:38:59.960
CALCULATION FOR HOW IF YOU ME

03:39:00.026 --> 03:39:00.327

03:39:00.393 --> 03:39:01.228
THAT DEDUCTIBLE.

03:39:01.294 --> 03:39:03.029

SO THERE'S A MECHANISM AND THEN

03:39:12.939 --> 03:39:13.707
