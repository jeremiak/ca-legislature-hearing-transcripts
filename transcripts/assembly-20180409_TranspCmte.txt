AS YOU KNOW OUR SON ETHAN HAWKE'S WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED ON NOVEMBER TWENTY FOURTH. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AS RESULT OF DEBRIS ON THE FIFTY SEVEN FREEWAY. HE WAS JUST ONE MONTH PASSED HIS SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY. HE MADE AN IMPACT ON EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS BLESSED TO MEET HIM. THE SEVEN HUNDRED PLUS PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED HIS MEMORIAL SERVICE CAN ATTEST TO THAT. HE CONTINUES TO BE MISSED EVERY SINGLE MOMENT OF EVERY SINGLE DAY. BY THOSE WHO LOVED HIM. I HOPE THAT THIS BILL WILL PASS CAN HELP PREVENT THIS UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY FROM HAPPENING TO ANOTHER FAMILY. ON SATURDAY NOVEMBER NINETEENTH TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AS I WAS DRIVING HE SAID. TO PICK UP A GIRL HE LIKED FOR THEIR VERY FIRST DAY. I WAS PLANNING ON TAKING HIM TO GET HIS LEARNERS PERMIT THE FOLLOWING WEEK. A LARGE CHUNK OF METAL CAME THROUGH OUR WHEN CHILDREN HIT MY SON. IT CAME AT US WITH SUCH VELOCITY THAT THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS ESTIMATE AROUND. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES PER HOUR. THAT I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO REACT OR AVOID THE OBJECT. IT TORE A HOLE IN OUR WINDSHIELDS AND SLICE THROUGH MY SON. SEVERING HIS CAROTID ARTERY AND REMOVING HALF OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS FACE. IT THEN CONTINUED WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT BROKE HIS SEAT CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO THE STEEL OF THE REAR PASSENGER DOOR. FINALLY COMING TO A STOP IN THE REAR PASSENGER SEAT. WHERE THE CHP OFFICERS FOUND IT? THIS CHUNK OF METAL WEIGHING AN ESTIMATED FOUR TO SEVEN POUNDS. WAS LAUNCHED AT US FROM WHERE WE KNOW NOT THAT THE CHP BELIEVED THAT IT WAS LIKELY DEBRIS. WHICH HAD FALLEN OFF ANOTHER VEHICLE AND THEN HAVING BEEN LEFT IN THE ROAD. WHO IS ELEVATED BY YET ANOTHER VEHICLE AND HURL HURLED AT OUR VEHICLE AND MY CHILD? MY SON NEEDS AND WAS INCREDIBLY STRONG I FULLY BELIEVE THAT ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL IN HIS CONDITION WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE CAR THAT DAY. BUT MY ETHAN HUNG ON. WELL I DROVE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL APPLYING PRESSURE TO HIS WOUND THE DAMAGE TO HIS CAROTID ARTERY PATA STROKED THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE OF HIS BRAIN. HIS JOB WAS SHATTERED IN HIS FACE WAS TORN. FROM HERE ALLEN. HE WASN'T SURGERY FOR OUR SIMPLY JUST TRYING TO STOP THE BLEEDING. AND CLOSE HIS FACE. LATER PLANS TO REBUILD A NEW JOB FROM ISRAEL BEEN REPAIRED THE OTHER INJURIES SUSTAINED WOULD HAVE WAITED UNTIL MUCH FARTHER ALONG IN ITS RECOVERY. HAD HE MADE IT THAT FAR. TWO AND A HALF HOURS FOLLOWING THAT FIRST SURGERY HE WAS RUSHED BACK FOR ANOTHER THREE AND A HALF HOURS OF SURGERY. TO HAVE THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS SKULL REMOVED SO THAT THE SWELLING IN HIS BRAIN COULD FIND SOME RELIEF. HE LOST PART OF HIS RIGHT FRONTAL OPEN THAT SURGERY HAVING BEEN CRUSHED BY THE SWELLING. AND SUSTAINING TOO MUCH DAMAGE TO SAY. OVER THE NEXT FIVE DAYS EATEN INTO OUR TO MORE PROCEDURES TO INSERT PROBES. INTO HIS BRAIN TO MONITOR SWELLING IN ACTIVITY. ALONG WITH OTHER MEDICAL EFFORTS TO SAVE HIS LIFE. THE BEST TRAUMA TEAM NEUROSURGERY TEAM AND I SEE YOU TEAM DID EVERYTHING WITHIN THEIR POWER TO TRY TO SAVE MY SON. FOR FIVE DAYS HE FOUGHT TO CLING TO LIFE ULTIMATELY. EATEN SUCCUMBED TO HIS INJURIES AT FIVE THREE AM. THANKSGIVING MORNING. UPON LEAVING THE HOSPITAL AFTER LOSING MY SON.

ALSO ALL OF THE OTHER FAMILIES WHO CAN'T BE HERE TODAY. THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN LOST. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED HAD PROPERTY DAMAGE IN THOSE WHO. ARE MISSING LOVED ONES TODAY BECAUSE OF OTHER PEOPLE NOT SECURING THEIR LOADS. EVERY SINGLE DAY I SEE VEHICLES DRIVING WITH UNSAFE FLOATS INDIVIDUALS WHO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HE SAID. REGULARLY APPROACH ME TO REPORT THAT THEY SAW AND SAFE VEHICLES ARE ITEMS LEFT IN THE ROADWAYS. REPORTING NEAR MISSES ON THEIR WAY TO WORK. DESCRIBING THE ACCIDENT THEY SAW UNFOLD BEFORE THEIR EYES DUE TO DEBRIS ON THE ROADWAYS AND HIGHWAYS. FAR TOO OFTEN PEOPLE FIND LADDERS FURNITURE PIPES TOOLS PAULA MANNER OF DEBRIS ON THE ROADWAYS AND HIGHWAYS. HAVING TIME ENOUGH TO TRY TO AVOID SUCH ITEMS HAS A HIGH PROBABILITY OF CAUSING ANOTHER COLLISION. WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE. MORE OFTEN HOWEVER THESE MOTORISTS ARE TRAVELING AT SUCH SPEEDS. THE DAY UNWITTINGLY HIT THESE ITEMS CAUSING DAMAGE TO THEIR VEHICLES. AND ARE CATAPULTING THESE ITEMS. INTO SOME OTHER UNSUSPECTING MOTORIST OR PASSENGER LIKE MY SON.

THIS DATA WILL BE HELPFUL IN ASSISTING THE STATE TO COME UP WITH AN INFORMED POLICY AROUND CANNABIS DE WISE. AS WE TRANSITION INTO THE LEGALIZED CANNABIS MARKET. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS NO WAY TO DETERMINE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ARRESTED FOR CANNABIS STEEL Y. ANNUALLY. BECAUSE EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY TRACKS THIS DATA INDIVIDUALLY AND INDEPENDENTLY. AND THERE CURRENTLY ISN'T A REQUIREMENT TO REPORT THE SAYS THAT. AS WE HAVE SEEN IN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE LEGALIZED CANNABIS AN INCREASE IN CANADA'S DRUG DRIVING. CAN BE EXPECTED DUE TO LEGALIZATION ACCORDING TO THE DENVER POST AFTER LEGALIZATION THE STATES OF COLORADO AND WASHINGTON. BOTH EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN CANADA SO INVOLVED ACCIDENTS ARE INVOLVING FATALITIES WITH THE WASHINGTON STATE EXPERIENCING AN EIGHTY ONE PERCENT INCREASE IN THESE ACCIDENTS. AND ON THE OTHER HAND COLORADO EXPERIENCE THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE PERCENT INCREASE IN THESE ACCIDENTS BETWEEN A YEAR TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. SO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE HOUSE ACCURATE AND RELIABLE DATA ON CANNABIS DO YOU WISE. THIS BILL AB TWENTY FIFTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO REPORT.

FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND AND ACCEPTING THAT I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THAT PROTECTS. STUDENT PRIVACY. AB TWENTY SIX SIXTY SIX. ESTABLISHES AN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT WHICH WILL MEASURE EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES THE STUDENTS AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO RECORDS IN PLACE THAT MEASURE LONG TERM STUDENT SUCCESS. KRIS STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES THE COLLABORATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. ATTRACT WAGE DATA SO THAT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS CAN BE IMPROVED. TO YIELD OPTIMAL RESULTS FOR ITS STUDENTS. HERE WITH ME TODAY ON BEHALF OF A. B.. TWENTY SIX SIXTY SIX. ARE LARA MATTOON FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND OTHER HAND THOUGH ESPINOZA WITH THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. THE BILL. SECOND. A PLEASE INTERNET. LARA MATERIAL AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT CANCERS OFFICE THAT OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS IS THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN OUR BOARD VOTED TO ENDORSE THE CHANCELLOR'S VISION FOR SUCCESS WITH CALLS OUT SIX. GOALS. A ONE OF THOSE GOALS FOCUSES ON INCREASING BY TWENTY PERCENT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO OBTAIN AN INDUSTRY VALUED CREDENTIAL. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT OUR PROGRAMS ARE ALIGNING WITH INDUSTRY NEEDS IS BY DOING A DATA MATCH THAT ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT WAGE GAINS FOR OUR STUDENTS. IT IS THEN PROVIDED IN THE AGGREGATE FOR INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR POLICY MAKERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW WELL OUR PROGRAMS ARE DOING IN SERVING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND THE NEEDS OF THE WORKFORCE. I APPRECIATE THE. RECOMMENDATION FROM THE COMMITTEE THAT RESULTED IN THE AMENDMENT TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND MAINTAIN PRIVACY AYE WITH THAT. WE ASK FOR YOUR I DON'T THINK YOU. HAVE JUST BEEN US ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TOWARDS THEM. CO SPONSOR OF AB TWO SIX SIX SIX. ARE A LOT OF THIS WORK CAME OUT OF THE JOINT ADMINISTRATION OF THE ADULT ED BLOCK PRO. GRANTS A BETWEEN THE CHANCES OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND LOOKING AT WAGE AND. INCOME DATA. Y. AFTER LOOKING AT SOME OF THE THE GOALS. WITH REGARDS TO THE ADULT EDUCATION POPULATION WE WERE LET OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. STEPPED BACK AND TOOK A LOOK AT HOW THIS COULD. FEED INTO OUR OUR OUR NEW ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM THAT'S REPORTED TO THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS DASHBOARD. AND WITHIN THAT DATA. ONCOLOGY CAREER INDICATORS ARE COLLECTED AND SO WE ENVISIONED THIS DATA TO BE INFORMING FORMING A LOT OF THAT INFORMATION WHICH WOULD INCLUDE. IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS THE COLLECTION OF. THE NUMBER OF THE NUMBER OF PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS THAT ENTERED THE WORKFORCE RIGHT AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. THE TYPE OF INDUSTRY A WAGE STATE. SO I DON'T LET LET US LOOK ELECT SCHOOLS LOOK AND SEE OUR STUDENTS PURSUING C. T. CAREER IS. ARE THEY. GETTING JOBS THAT ARE ALIGNED TO SOME OF THE CAREER A CT COURSES OR INDUSTRY SECTOR CERTIFICATES THEY'VE RECEIVED. ALSO GO BACK IN INFORMED SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS ARE WHETHER. THE PROGRAMS BEING OFFERED IS FULFILLING OF THEIR LOCAL NEEDS. AND ALSO. HELPING THEM OF FUTURE PLAN UP PLAN OUT. OTHER PROGRAMS AND SO FORTH SO WITH THAT. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I THINK A MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE FROM THE PUBLIC THAT WE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME. THANK YOU MARK MCDONALD ON BEHALF OF THE FOOTHILL DE ANZA AND KERN COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ARE THERE ANY. INDIVIDUALS THAT LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OTHER ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE ON THIS BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I'M THINK YOU MISSED MEDINA. AYE MEASURE LIKE IT'S SEE THIS HIGHER EDUCATION AS WELL WITH BOTH WELL BY TEN TO A COUPLE QUESTIONS REAL AND THEY ARE ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS. AND ESPECIALLY WITH SO SECURITY NUMBERS. FIRST ONE IS. IS WHAT WHAT OTHER ALTERNATE WHY SO SECURITY NUMBERS WHERE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH TO GET THIS INFORMATION. AVAILABLE. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CURRENTLY HAS THE DATA SHARING AGREEMENT WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOP. IMPLEMENT ABOUT MY DEPARTMENT AND WHAT WE UNDERSTAND FROM THAT EXISTING DATA SHARING AGREEMENT IS THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY CAN DO THIS WAGE FILE MATCHES WITH THE FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. WE HAVE EXPLORED OTHER IDEAS LIKE JUST USING THE LAST FOR DOING A FUZZY MATCHING WE'VE BEEN TOLD THERE'S NOT AN OPTION THERE. WELL I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT ANSWER BECAUSE I'VE LOOKED INTO EDT A LOT. WITH WHAT THEY DO WITH SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. AND. THERE REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY STILL USE FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS INCLUDING FOR MAILING INFORMATION TO PEOPLE THAT HAS THEIR FULL ADDRESS FULL NAME IN FULL SO SECURITY NUMBERS. AND MET WITH THEM DIRECTLY TO SEE HOW THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT IN WHY THEY CAN'T USE. ONLY FOUR DIGITS AND I. AM SORRY THAT THAT'S THE BEST WE CAN DO FOR SAY WHY WOULD YOU HOLD IT WHOLE NUMBERS WE SHOULDN'T. I MEAN I REALLY THINK. IT'S EVEN A QUESTION MARK IF WE SHOULD USE THE LAST FOUR DIGITS BUT AT A MINIMUM WE SHOULD NOT BE CONTINUING TO SPREAD THE PROBLEM. AND AM EDT HE'S GOT ITS OWN PROBLEMS ON THIS SAYS THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA TAKE SIX OR SEVEN YEARS TO DIG OUT OF IT. THAT'S THE BEST THEY CAN DO WE SHOULD NOT BE PUT IN I PERSONALLY VERSION OF BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT. OF MOTOR VEHICLES RIGHT DOWN THAT SAME PATH. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE ARE REFERRING TO A VERY PRIVATE NUMBERS THAT ARE CONSTITUENTS ALREADY ARE VERY CONCERNED GET SHARED NOT JUST BY GOVERNMENT BUT IN GENERAL. WHICH GOES TO MY NEXT QUESTION AND THAT IS HAVE YOU THOUGHTS OR COULD YOU DO GIVEN THE. HEIGHTENED PRIVACY CONCERNS AND HOW VERY IMPORTANT IT IS WE DON'T JUST READ DO BAD POLICY AND BAD USE OF SO SECURE MEMBERS BY THE STATE. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED AN OPT IN. OR ARE GETTING THE INFORMATION DIRECTLY WITH PERMISSION FROM THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE SU SU SECURITY AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ARE TRYING TO GET EMPOWERING. THEM TO CONTROL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THEIR NUMBERS. BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS. AND MINIMUM A BEST PRACTICES AND EIGHT I DON'T IF YOU LOOK AT THAT OPTION AND IF NOT WHY THAT'S NOT MORE FEASIBLE. IF. SO UNDER EXISTING PRACTICE ARE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE YES YOU AND YOU SEE ALL USE THIS EXISTING MECHANISM. WITHOUT AN OPT IN IN THE INFORMATION ONLY COMES BACK FOR. POLICYMAKERS ARE COLLEGE USE IN THE AGGREGATE SO THERE'S NO PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION THAT HAPPENS THROUGH THAT. WE HAVE. THIS QUESTION CAME UP ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD DO AN OPT IN OR OPT OUT PROCESS. AND I THINK OUR ONLY CONCERN IS ABOUT THE HOW THAT WOULD FUNCTION THROUGH THE TWO OFFICES RIGHT I MEAN I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO STEP. GO BACK AND TALK TO OUR SPECIFIC DATA FOLKS TO SEE. HOW THAT PROCESS WOULD WOULD LOOK LIKE? AND WHAT THAT WOULD ENTAIL IF IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE. WE DID A SIMILAR PROCESS FOR THE STUDENT THE COMMISSION WHERE RIGHT NOW PLEASE SHARE. INFORMATION FROM K. TWELVE DISTRICTS TO STUDENT A COMMISSION SO WE CAN TRY AND GET THEM AS MUCH FINANCIAL AID IS POSSIBLE. BUT NOT PROCESS DID INCLUDE AN OPT OUT FOR STUDENTS AND SO WE'RE THINKING MAYBE THERE'S A MODEL THERE THAT WE TO FOLLOW BUT WE JUST WEREN'T READY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION TODAY. AND AND. I THINK YOU BECAUSE I ONLY KNOW TO THE CHAIR TO HAVE HIGHER EDUCATION TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR STUDENTS AND COMPLETELY SUPPORT THE NEED FOR US TO HAVE INFORMATION THAT'S RELIABLE. SO WE CAN KNOW WHAT WORKS AND WE CAN WE CAN AND REINFORCE THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WORK AND SEE WHAT DOESN'T WORK ABOUT OTHERS AND HOW WE CAN HELP. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CRITICAL EDUCATION THAT REALLY ANYTHING GOVERNMENT DOES I'M I I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL THIS TIME MAYBE BY THE TIME YOU SAW HER EDUCATIONAL. HOW THIS I JUST CAN'T SAY ENOUGH HOW WE SHOULD NOT BE PERPETUATING POOR USE OF FULL SO SECURITY NEVER THAT BART STATE HAS NO BUSINESS DOING THAT ANYMORE? AND. ONCE YOU GET DOWN THAT PATH YOU END UP WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT WON'T CHANGE. I REWRITING CODE THAT CAN'T BE DONE UNLESS YOU SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DOING IT. AND WE END UP PATCHWAY IN A PROBLEM SO I HOPE I STRONGLY HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER. I'M NOT USING FULL SO SECURITY NUMBERS I THINK IT MIGHT HELP ET DE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE. PRESSURE ON THEM TO GET IT RIGHT. A AND ALTERNATIVELY PERHAPS ALSO AT THE SAME TIME YOU MAY NOT GET THE SAME QUALITY OF DATA BUT ALLOW PEOPLE TO DECIDE WHEN THEY'RE SO SECURING MEMBERS ARE GIVEN WHAT THEY'RE USED FOR EVEN IF IT'S. NOT DISAGGREGATED. BUT WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE CHARITABLE HAVE A CHANCE TO WORK ON AGAIN IN HIGHER EDUCATION. I'VE I THINK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE. OF ALONGSIDE SO WAS I. I TO HAVE A CONCERN OVER THE SECURITY OF THIS I'M I'M GONNA VOTE YET I QUIT TODAY WITH THE HOPES THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT WE. SOME MEMBER BREAK BAKER BROUGHT UP. BECAUSE I AM ABLE PROPONENT OF CT AND I THINK THE DATA IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND FOR OF JOBS GOING FORWARD WHAT WE NEED IN THE COMMUNICATIVE. AND. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THIS CONSIDERATION. AS IT MOVES ON TO THE COMMITTEE HOPEFULLY. I THINK YOU ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I MISSED MEDINA WAS A CLOSE UP WELL WE WILL CONTINUE TO DIALOGUE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. I THINK THIS MEDINA WE HAVE A MOTION FIRST FROM.

AS WE'VE DISCUSSED IN THE COMMITTEE BEFORE MANY TRANSIT AGENCIES HAVE SUCCESSFUL TRANSIT PASS PROGRAMS. FOR STUDENTS FROM MANY OTHER PEOPLE. I AM WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE TRANSIT AGENCIES HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY PERCENT INCREASE IN FUNDING. THAT BECAUSE THAT CAN BE USED TO EXPAND THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF WHAT IS OUT THERE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS STUDY REQUIRED BY YOUR BILL. IS SO IMPORTANT TO GET THE DATA. BEFORE WE CONSIDER ANY KIND OF A NEW PROOF PROGRAM. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT TRANSIT AGENCIES SCHOOLS AND OTHERS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW. AND HOW THEIR PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED IN WHAT GAPS MIGHT STILL EXIST. SO WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALLED. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE FRAZIER. FRAZIER AYE FONG FUNG I AND WE ARE CURRY. AND WE ARE CURRY AYE BAKER. BAKER AYE BERMAN. CHAU. CHIU AYE DALY. DALY AYE FRIEDMAN.

THE BILL IS TWELFTH WILL KEEP OPEN TRAPS MEMBERS CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR COMING OVER TO EUROPE. AB. THIRTY FIFTEEN. PLEASE PERSONA READING. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS UP THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE B. THIRTY FIFTEEN RETRO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S NEED. FOR A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION OR FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION NETWORK AND SUPPLY CHAINS FROM OUR CURRENT DIESEL BASED TECHNOLOGY. TOWARDS ZERO AND NEAR ZERO EMISSIONS FUTURE. THIS WILL BE A COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE PROCESS AND NOT WITHOUT SOME CONTROVERSY. BUT IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION IN CLEAN AIR GOALS THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT A TRANSITION NEEDS TO OCCUR. BUT BECAUSE THIS IS COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE IT IS IMPERATIVE TO BE PLANNED. THAT MAY BE IMPLEMENTED WITH OUR INDUSTRY AND LABOR PARTNERS AT THE TABLE. AND THAT WHEN WE INVEST STATE DOLLARS INTO NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND NEW EQUIPMENT THAT WE DO IT WITH A WELL THOUGHT OUT IN STRATEGIC PLAN. OTHERWISE YOU RUN THE RISK OF SETTLING THOSE WHO ULTIMATELY. PAID FOR INVESTMENT IN OUR POLL AND IMPORTS OF CARGO THAT IT SHIPPED. WITH SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND JEOPARDIZE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF OUR PARTS AND I THINK. IN PARTICULAR NOW WITH THE COMPETITION OF PORTS. IN OTHER STATES OF THIS BECOMES REALLY BAD CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. I AS YOU ARE AWARE CALIFORNIA'S PORTS ARE A CRITICAL COMPONENT COMPONENT OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY AND AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DISTRICT WITH HEAVY INTEREST IN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS. I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND INVESTMENT IN OUR PORT GATEWAYS CAN SUPPORT AND GROW JOBS ALL ACROSS ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. FOR EXAMPLE THE VALUE OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS THAT WERE EXPORTED TO THE PORT OF OAKLAND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TOTAL OVER SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL THAT INCREASED TRADE BARRIERS CAN CAUSE REAL HARM. THIS CAN OCCUR AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL LIKE WE HAVE SEEN WITH TERRACE BEING ACTIVELY DEBATED IN BEIJING AND WASHINGTON DCSCENERY RIGHT NOW WHICH THREATENED TO HEAVILY IMPACT OUR STATE'S FARMERS. AND AG COMMUNITIES INCREASES IN THE COST OF TRADE CAN ALSO OCCUR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AB THIRTY FIFTEEN WILL HELP TO AVOID THIS. WE CAN ALL ANTICIPATE THAT WILL WE WILL HAVE MORE COSTLY PART INFRASTRUCTURE ANY EQUIPMENT COSTS BUT WITH GOOD PLANNING AND LONG TERM INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT OUR TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSIONS. WILL HAVE POSITIVE IMPACTS ON JOBS AND LIVES IN BOTH RURAL CALIFORNIA AND IN. COMMUNITIES NEIGHBORING THE PORTS WITH ME TODAY IS MY CHECK UP OF THE PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MIGHT TAKE WITH THE MSA. AND SUPPORT OF THE BILL ONE AND I THINK JUST TO THE ACT OF ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S COMMENTS. QUICKLY WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE WORK WITH THE STATE AND PARTNERSHIP ON INFRASTRUCTURE AN ON AIR QUALITY ISSUES. WE LIKE TO HAVE THAT. PARTNERSHIP CONTINUE IN A FORMAL CAPACITY WITH INCLUSION OF THE PLANS. AND A NO MATTER WHAT TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY COMES TO PASS. BUT WE DO KNOW FROM OUR EXPERIENCES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND. IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN GET TO ZERO EMISSIONS. THAT THEIR TO PASS FOR THAT. ONE IS WHAT'S HAPPENING THEN THE PORT OF LA AND LONG BEACH WHICH IS INVESTMENT. AND. ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND AND. NEW INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE MOST MODERN EQUIPMENT WE HAVE. THE OTHER ONE IS THE PORT OF OAKLAND. AND THAT'S WE HAD OUR HARPER TERMINAL GO BANKRUPT THAT IS THE WRONG TYPE OF ZERO EMISSIONS TERMINAL. THE NO WANTS TO SAY AND SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE LONG TERM PLANNING SO WE CAN FACILITATE THE INVESTMENT WE NEED TO TRANSITION PROPERLY. THANK YOU. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME HE REPRESENT PLEASE. AIDAN MEDI UP YOU KNOW SUFFER LA. A WEIRD SPORT OF THE BILL. WE ARE EXPERIMENTING RIGHT NOW WITH THE ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR YARD EQUIPMENT THAT A COUPLE OF OUR LARGEST YARDS WE'VE INSTALLED CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND.

RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL TODAY. IN ORDER SUPPORT THE FREIGHT INDUSTRY WE MUST FIRST GET THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO MAKE WISE INVESTMENTS AND PROMOTE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE REGULATIONS. WHEN YOU STEPPED UP THERE YOU HAD ME AT HELLO. I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ANDERS INDUSTRY TO WORK WITH THE CORRESPONDING SEAT AGENCIES GET THE MOST ROBUST INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THE PORTS WHICH ARE A THIRD. OF OUR ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE JOBS THAT IT WILL AND DOES SUPPORT. I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY. VERY ENTHUSIASTIC. KLAY SO LINKLETTER SPEAKER MATH. MADAM SECRETARY OF MY.

THIS MEASURE ALLOWS TRANSIT AGENCIES IN OUR STATE TO RETAIN THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE IN CENTER FUNDING. AS THE INTRODUCE MORE ZERO EMISSION TRANSIT BUSES. THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS DEVELOPING REGULATIONS TO ACHIEVE A ZERO EMISSION TRANSIT SYSTEM STATE WIDE. BY THE YEAR TWENTY FORTY. THIS IS A LOT OF ALL GOAL IT HAS WIDESPREAD WIDESPREAD SUPPORT. AND IT'LL HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE TARGETS. BUT WITH JUST SWIFT TRANSITION. WELCOME ADDITIONAL COST PRESSURES ON TRANSIT AGENCIES WHO ALREADY OPERATE ON SMALL MARGINS. PRESSURES TO INCREASE BUS FARES. THE PRICE FOR A ZERO EMISSION BUS CAN BE THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. APPROXIMATELY MORE EXPENSIVE THEN ITS TRADITIONAL COUNTERPART. AS OF A FEW MONTHS AGO TRANSIT AGENCIES IN OUR STATE HAD ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN ZERO EMISSION BUSES IN OPERATION. WITH AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED FORTY ON ORDER. ALL OF THESE PURCHASES ALL OF THESE WERE PURCHASED WITH THE HELP OF INCENTIVE FUNDING I REPEAT ALL OF THEM WERE PURCHASED WITH THE HELP OF SOME TYPE OF INCENTIVE FOR. ON TOP OF THE UP FRONT COST PRESSURES TO PURCHASE THESE MORE EXPENSIVE BUSES TRANSIT AGENCIES MUST ALSO FUNDING CREATE A COMPLETELY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A ZERO EMISSION FLEA. IT'S VITAL THAT FUNDING REMAIN AVAILABLE IN ORDER FOR TRANSIT AGENCIES TO SET. EXCESSIVELY COMPLY WITH RAPID. TRANSITION REGULATIONS. WITH ME TODAY IS MICHAEL PAYMENTS ALL REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION MODERATE TOP REPRESENTING THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION. AUTHORITY.

WE WILL HAVE A FOR SPEAKER PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND. WE REPRESENT PLEASE. SURE THING MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS MICHAEL HIMSELF CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAILY NOTED THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD IS IN THE PROCESS OF PROMULGATING A REGULATION. THAT WOULD TRANSITION CALIFORNIAS TRANSIT FLEET TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ZERO EMISSION BY TWENTY FORTY. AT THE HEART OF THIS REGULATION IS A PURCHASE MANDATE. THAT WOULD REQUIRE EVERY TRANSIT AGENCY THE STATE. BEGINNING SOMETIME AFTER TWENTY TWENTY TO PURCHASE ZERO EMISSION BUSES AS PART OF THEIR NECKS PROCUREMENTS. WHEN THIS PURCHASE MANDATE GOES INTO A FACT. ARB WILL DISALLOW PUBLIC TRANSACTIONS HE'S A MEAT ONLY THE BASELINE PURCHASE REQUIREMENTS FROM ACCESSING INCENTIVE FUNDING ALREADY APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. TO SUPPORT ZERO MISSION BUS DEPLOYMENT. YOUR BE ARGUES THAT THIS APPROACH IS NECESSARY AND BECAUSE OF ELECTED BOARD POLICY THAT PROHIBITS THE USE OF INCENTIVE FUNDING. TO BE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AYE AND APPROPRIATE NOT TO ENCOURAGE ZERO MISSION BUS DEPLOYMENT ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE REGULATIONS. SOME SUPPORTERS OF YOUR BEES APPROACH OF TAKEN THAT. CONSISTENT BUT MORE STRIDENT POSITION. ARGUING THAT IN MEETING REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS THE POLLUTER SHOULD PAY. I IN DOING SO THE SUPPORTERS OF TAKING A PRINCIPLE CALMLY APPLY TO OTHER REGULATED ENTITIES. THAT POLLUTE AS A CREE PROFIT AND APPLIED IT TO A RESOURCE CONSTRAINED PUBLIC TRANSIT AND SEE. THAT ALREADY REDUCE EMISSIONS BY TAKING CARS OFF THE ROAD. I KNOW MATTER JUST. THE JUSTIFICATION ARE MEMBERS OF WRONGLY AGREEING THAT LIMITING ACCESS TO ENSIGN FUNDING FOR ZERO MISSION BUS DEPLOYMENT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. I WITHOUT ACCESS JONES AND FUNDING THAT IS IF PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES HAVE TO BEAR THE FULL COST OF THIS TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION BUSES. THEY HAVE TO PULL RESOURCES AWAY FROM OTHER VALUABLE USES SUCH A STATE OF GOOD REPAIR. DAILY SERVICE AYE AND OTHERWISE UNDERMINE THE VIABILITY PUBLIC TRANSIT. WE ASK FOR GOD OF THANK YOU FOR THE DISSERTATION. ON NEXT WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MORE ATOP ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. AND. WE ARE IN VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AS OUTLINED AIR BE IS PROMULGATING REGULATIONS AND WE ARE WE'RE APPRECIATIVE OF THESE THESE RAGS THERE ARE. OTHER BOLD THEIR INNOVATIVE. THEY ARE AGGRESSIVE. BUT THEY COME WITH A REAL A REAL PRICE TAG AND BOB FOR ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY WHAT WE KNOW AS WE'VE. WE'VE GONE BACK AND WE'VE CRUNCHED THE NUMBERS AND WE. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A A RP BUT BUT THE NUMBERS ARE. PARTICULARLY STARK FOR US. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A ACOSTA FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO COMPLY WITH THIS WITH THIS REGULATION AND JUST TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT. ARE ARE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE BUDGET FOR. THE ENTIRE AYE COUNTIES A TRANSIT SYSTEM IS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THIS WOULD WIPE OUT TWO YEARS OF FUNDING THAT WE. ARE THAT WE USE TO I TRIED IMPORTANT TRANSIT SERVICES. TO TOURISTS ARE CITIZENS. I'M WE THINK THIS IS ONE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHAT IT WILL DO IS IT'LL HELP. PROVIDE INNOVATION AND. HOPEFULLY GET THAT COST LOWER AS WE ARE ONTINUE TO INNOVATE AND PROVIDE MORE COST EFFECTIVE MEANS TO MEET THIS REGULATION. I'M NOT STILL GOING TO BE VERY VERY COSTLY FOR AGENCIES. WE. WE WE HAVE ESTIMATED THAT WE THINK OF REGULATION LIKE THIS COULD COST. IN TERMS OF TRANSIT SERVICE A TWENTY TWO PERCENT REDUCTION IN SERVICE. ARE WE. SERVE PRIMARILY A LOW INCOME RESIDENTS OF ORANGE COUNTY O. ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF OUR. OF OUR BUS RIDERS ARE FROM HOUSEHOLDS THAT EARN LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SEWER A PROPOSAL. THAT COULD CUT SERVICE COULD HAVE A VERY REAL IMPACT SO WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS THOUGHTFUL BILL THAT WILL GET US ON THE ROAD TO MAKING. UP A BALANCED. AND APPROPRIATE. REGULATORY SCHEME.

AT YOUR FRAZIER ARRAIGNED CANDY WITH CLEAN ENERGY. AND ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF OUR TRADE ASSOCIATIONS OF BY RG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA AND. EAGLE COALITION HOW WE OUGHT TO BE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND. I THINK THE THE AUTHOR INVOLVED RESPECT IN OUR A SUPPORTERS AND MADE THE CASE. VERY WELL IF THIS IS GONNA REQUIRE A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FUNDING. AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS IS GONNA SQUEEZE OUT THE EXISTING. PROJECTS AND. AND DEATH FUNDS FOR THOSE ALREADY IN THIS PROGRAM. AND THE OTHER RIGHT NOW PROGRAM IS TECH NEWS SHOW FOR ZERO AND NEAR ZERO BYTES. IT'S THE ULTIMATE ULTIMATELY COME DOWN TO AIR BE MAKING THE DECISIONS WITH THEIR FUNDING PLAN AND THERE COULD BE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AND WITH THIS MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FUNDING NEEDED IT'S GONNA SQUEEZE OUT. THOSE THAT ARE IT NEEDED TO ALREADY. ALSO MENTION TO YOU THAT. HOW BUSINESS CERTAINTY IS VERY IMPORTANT IN A STEADY STREAM OF FUNDS THAT ARE KNOWN AND? AT IT WITH A GREAT AMOUNT TIME THAT OUT IN FRONT AND I WERE CONCERNED THAT THAT THAT WILL BE. AT AN ISSUE AS WELL AS THE SITE GOES FOR SO WE DO RESPECTFULLY WHERE I REQUEST ID CONCERT SOME CONSIDERATION OF THE OTHER PROJECTS THAT THIS WILL BE SQUEEZED OUT FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU. DECISION A WE REPRESENT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JOSHUA SHOP FOR THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA AND THEIR BIG BLUE BUS TRANSIT OPERATION IN SUPPORT YOU. STEVE WELCOME AT THE CENTER FOR TRANSLATION ENVIRONMENT ALSO SUPPORT THANK YOU. VINCENT WHERE MUCH OF WHAT THE WHITENING GRIP ON THAT THE PYD MOTORS A CALIFORNIA BASED MANUFACTURER BETTER LOGIC TRUCKS AND BUSES IN SUPPORT. MOVE THE BILL. ANY OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TALK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. MANY MAKE ROOM PLEASE FOR ONE THIRD OF ONE WITNESS PLACE PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME WHO REPRESENT PLEASE. KATHY CATHERINE PHILLIPS WITH SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS INTEREST IN ZERO EMISSION BUSES WE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING ZERO EMISSION BUSES FOR A LONG TIME. I WANT TO CORRECT A FEW THINGS THAT SHOWED UP IN THE AN OUNCE THIS AND ALSO IN THE TESTIMONY WE JUST HEARD. THERE IS NO DRAFT REGULATION OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. WHAT HAS BEEN CIRCULATED IS ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS ARE? WHITE PAPERS. AND THERE'S THE MOST RECENT WHITE PAPER INDICATES ó THERE'S A THREE PAGER THAT CAME OUT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. INDICATES THAT THE. AGENCY HAS BEEN LISTENING TO THE TRANSIT AGENCIES AS THEY HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS. AND ARE PREPARED TO. CHANGE SOME OF THE ELEMENTS. OF THEIR PROPOSAL SO THAT. THE THE THE START DATE OF THE REGULATION WON'T BE AS SOON AS HAS BEEN IN THE MOST RECENT ONE. BUT FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT'S WHAT ARE YOU KNOW HAVE YOU EVER HAD THAT EXPERIENCE WHERE. YOU THINK SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND THEN FIFTEEN YEARS LATER YOUR WORST FEAR COMES TRUE. THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING TODAY BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS WE WORRIED ABOUT WHEN WE STARTED GROUP. ENVIRONMENTALISTS STARTED SUPPORTING INCENTIVES FOR EARLY. ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGIES AND PUBLIC MONEY GOING INTO EARLY ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES THIS WAS THAT WE WOULD INCREASINGLY SEE THE REGULATED INDUSTRY COMING IN AND SAYING. YOU SHOULDN'T ADOPT ANY REGULATION UNLESS YOU HAVE PUBLIC MONEY TO PUT UP FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THAT REGULATION. AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING HERE THE KINDS OF TESTIMONY WE HEARD HERE TODAY IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HEAR. INCREASINGLY OVER AT THE REGULATORY AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS REGULATIONS ARE COMING UP. SO OF FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A PREMATURE BILL THE REGULATION STILL HASN'T EVEN COME OUT IN DRAFT FORM. SECONDLY. YOU KNOW ASPECTS OF THE BILL ARE FINE THE ONE THING THAT WE WOULD ASK IS THAT THE. PHRASE THAT WOULD ALLOW COMPLIANCE THIS MONEY TO BE USED FOR COMPLIANCE AS OPPOSED TO EARLY. EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN EARLY COMPLIANCE. BE STRICKEN. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. VOICE OUR OPINION WHO. OF HIS BILL SING NONE. ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. I'M GONNA VOTE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I'M WANT TO TAKE A LOOK OF MORE AT SOME OF THE. METRICS AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SMALLER AGENCIES IN THE LARGER AGENCIES AND HOW THEY'RE FUNDING SOURCES COME FROM AS WELL. AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT OVERLY BROAD AND IN TERMS OF TRYING TO. TARGETING EVERYONE ONE MAYBE IT SHOULD BE TARGETING THE AGENCIES THAT REALLY ARE UNABLE TO TURN. AROUND. MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS. THAT IS AN EXCELLENT POINT. SOME OF IT SOMEBODY AGENCIES HAVE LOCAL. REVENUES OTHERS DON'T. THE FAREBOX RECOVERY. AND DYNAMIC IN EACH AGENCY IS DIFFERENT AND. I WAS A BOARD MEMBER. AT THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY FOR YEARS AND IT'S SO. THERE PRESSURES TO RAISE THE FARE BOX. RECOVERY BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING NO. EXPENSES AND RIDERSHIP IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE TO ME THE REAL GOAL OF THESE TRANSIT AGENCIES IS TO CARRY AS MANY FOLKS AS POSSIBLE. AND. SO I THINK WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOAL HERE IS JUST HOW WE GET THERE WHAT ARE THE METRICS WHAT IS THE TIMING THE TIMING QUESTION IS IMPORTANT. SO WHY APPRECIATE QUESTIONS AND I WILL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A YES VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER DALY. SO. WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE. REGULATORY AGENCIES OUT THERE. SOMETIMES QUEST TO DO GOOD. DOES HARM. AND. I WOULD HATE HOPE IT'S NOT A VEILED ACTION TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES BY DECIMATING THE ABILITY FOR TRANSIT SYSTEMS TO OPERATE. AND. ADDS CAPACITY RATHER THAN TAKE AWAY FROM OF THE CAPACITY I WISH A OR B. WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO THIS. I GUESS IS HERE CLICK HERE REPRESENTING A RB. NO I'M SORRY SIR WE'RE ONLY REPRESENTING SIERRA CLUB OR YOU MENTIONED IT WAS PREMATURE BILL LIST WELL I DO THINK IT'S A PREMATURE BILL THAT THAT'S A SIERRA CLUB POSITION. OKAY THANK YOU PROOF CLARIFYING THAT. BUT WILL THANK IS A PREEMPTIVE BILL. BECAUSE HALF THE TIME WHEN WHITE PAPERS OR. THOUGHTS COME OUT OF AN AGENCY THEY BECOME. NOW REGULATION WITHOUT MUCH THOUGHT PROCESS. SO WITH THAT I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I REALLY DO THINK. ALLOWING ACCESS TO INCENTIVES. REDUCES THE NEEDS FOR CUTTING WE ARE CURRY. AND WE ARE CURRY AYE BAKER. BAKER AYE BERMAN. SHOW. CHIU AYE DALY. DALY AYE FRIEDMAN FRIEDMAN AYE GIPSON. GIPSON AYE HARPER. MATHIS. MEDINA. MEDINA AYE NAZARIAN. O'DONNELL. O'DONNELL I WE DOES TEND WILL LEAVE THE ROLE CONTRACTS MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THINKING. SOME REMEMBER CREEL. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTEEN. ALL SEE WHEN YOU'RE READY. Q.. I GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE M. HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX FIFTEEN. A BILL THAT WOULD HELP MAXIMIZE SAFE AND CONVENIENT ACCESS FOR BICYCLES AND PEDESTRIANS TO CALIFORNIA PARKS. CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO NUMEROUS STATE AND LOCAL PARKS THAT OFFER FUND AN ENRICHING EXPERIENCE TO THOSE WHO MAKE USE OF THEM. ACCESS TO THESE PARKS HAS MANY UPSIDES INCLUDING ENCOURAGING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN PROMOTING HEALTH AND MENTAL WELLNESS. IN SOME CASES BEAST PICTURESQUE PARKS ARE WITHIN SIGHT OF MANY RESIDENTS BUT JUST OUT OF REACH. THESE PARKS CAN HAVE ACCESS ISSUES ARE PHYSICAL BARRIERS NEAR THEM. SUCH AS ROADWAYS ARE UNSAFE TERRAIN THAT MAKE IT HAZARDOUS FOR PEOPLE TO ENSURE THEM ON FOOT OR RIDING BIKES. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION OR CALTRANS IS CHARGED WITH COORDINATING IN DEVELOPING TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND POLICY HOWEVER. ISSUES RELATING TO SAVE PARK ACCESS ARE NOT OFTEN CONSIDER WHEN PLANNING. AND POLICY MAKING FOR TRANSPORTATION. PROJECTS. TRUST ISSUE PROJECTS. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTEEN WILL MANDATE THAT CALTRANS COLLABORATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION AND OTHER PUBLIC ENTITIES. TO FACILITATE GREATER COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION THAT EMPHASIZES THESE CONCERNS OF SAFE PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE ACCESS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. THIS COOPERATION WILL HELP CLEAR THE WAY FOR MORE OF OUR RESIDENTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MAGNIFICENT. PARKS WITHIN OUR STATE AND CONSEQUENTLY ENCOURAGING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROMOTING HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS. NO ONE SHOULD BE DENIED ACCESS TO SAFE FUN PARKS AND THOSE EXPERIENCES. OUR PARKS OUR PRECIOUS RESOURCES FOR OUR STATE AND OUR RESIDENTS. AND WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE CAN ENJOY THEM SUCH AS THIS BEAUTIFUL. BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH THAT WE HAVE IN THIS A COMMITTEE ROOM. AND WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY ARE A FELLOW ADDED ON THOUGH OF LATINO OUTDOORS AND ONE A COMING DOWN ALL OF THE OUT OF WORK OUT OF ON CALIFORNIA. PLEASE TEACH NAMELY REPRESENT PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS OFTEN EITHER ALONE THOUGH I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE YOU KNOW WHAT DOORS TODAY IN SUPPORT. OF AB. TWO SIX ONE FIVE. BUT YOU KNOW DOORS IS UNIQUE AND LET YOU KNOW LET ORGANIZATION. WORKING TO CREATE A NATIONAL COMMUNITY OF LEADERS IN CONSERVATION AND OUTDOOR EDUCATION. IN THE STATE AND AND IN THE COUNTRY. AS PART OF THIS WORK WERE FOCUSED ON EXPANDING AMPLIFYING LOOKING EXPERIENCE IN THE OUTDOORS. BY PROVIDING LEADERSHIP MENTORSHIP AND PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. TO LEADERS THROUGHOUT. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND DOING THIS WORK IN PARKS AND OTHER PUBLIC LAND SPEED. SUFFER IF YOU WANT DOORS OUTINGS INCLUDE TAKING STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ON. HIKING AND BACKPACKING ó WHICH INCLUDE. COMPONENTS OF INTERPRETATION AND AFTER EDUCATION. TYPICALLY JUST INVOLVE CORDONING VEHICULAR TRANSPORTATION YOU KNOW GETTING FOLKS INTO A CARAVAN AND GOING OUT TO THESE DIFFERENT PLACES. BUT OFTENTIMES WE DO ENCOURAGE. IF POSSIBLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BEING ABLE TO ENCOURAGE THE PARTICIPANTS TO TO WALK OR BIKE TO THE. THE PARKING QUESTION. SO GOING THROUGH EMPHASIZING THIS YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE. NOT ONLY A FIRST TIME EXPERIENCE FOR A LOT OF THE IN THE PARTICIPANTS BUT. ENCOURAGING A REPEAT ACTION. GIVEN THE PROXIMITY TO A LOT OF THESE RESIDENCES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE MANY EXAMPLES WHERE EXISTING TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE MAKES THIS REALLY DIFFICULT. SO MAKING ACCESS TO STATE REGIONAL LOCAL PARKS AND PUBLIC LANDS ON FOOT OR BY BICYCLE. IS A CORPORATE ALREADY FOR NOTHING WHAT DOORS. ESPECIALLY FOR COMMUNITY RESIDENTS THAT LIVE. SOMETIMES WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF A PARK BUTTON THERE JUST ON THE WRONG SIDE OF A HIGHWAY OR FREEWAY. AND FOR THE REASONS I OUTLINED BY SOME REPEAL LATINO DOORS THAT IS A REALLY STRONG SUPPORTER OF AB TWO SIX ONE FIVE. AND AND THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING US A TIME PRESENT AND. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST IN MY BOOK NEXT BAKER PLEASE STATIONING YOU REPRESENT PLEASE. QUALIFY ME NOT A WITH OUT OF ON CALIFORNIA I AM THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR.
