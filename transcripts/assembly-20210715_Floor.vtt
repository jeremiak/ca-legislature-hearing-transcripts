01:19:26.995 --> 01:19:28.930
NO BROADBAND ACCESS. THIS IS

01:19:28.997 --> 01:19:30.866

BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY FOR

01:19:35.704 --> 01:19:37.706
DECADES BUT THE PANDEMIC ONLY

01:19:37.772 --> 01:19:38.840

LACK OF BROADBAND ACCESS

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:43.845

RESPONDING TO THESE ISSUES.

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.257
THAT MUCH HARDER. IT'S PAST

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:56.558
TIME OUR RURAL AREAS WERE

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:57.893
PRIORITISED FOR BROADBAND AND

01:19:57.959 --> 01:20:00.862

WAYS OF RURAL ELECTRIFICATION

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:48.443
THAT WAS DONE. EIGHTY YEARS AGO.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.644

PEOPLE POINT OUT SPEECHES I

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:03.091
JUST LIKE TO MAKE A POINT

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:04.025
BECAUSE OPERATION AND

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:05.093
MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.461
SIGNIFICANT THIS CAN'T BE A ONE

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:08.029
TIME THING. THERE HAS TO BE

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:10.298
COMMITMENT ONGOING. BOTH PUBLIC

CABLE EVERY YEAR. IN

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:20.775
CALIFORNIA. THAT HAS TO BE

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:21.643
REPLACED AT SIGNIFICANT

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.612
EXPENSE. AND I DON'T KNOW IF

THIS BILL REALLY. FULLY

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:26.948
CONTEMPLATES THE OPERATION

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:27.983
MAINTENANCE COSTS I THINK

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:29.017
THERE'S GONNA BE CLEAN UP WORK

01:21:29.084 --> 01:21:30.719
WE NEED TO FUTURE YEARS BUT

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:32.187

TO ENSURE THAT RATES WILL BE

01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:30.111
AFFORDABLE AND THAT THAT THERE

01:22:30.178 --> 01:22:32.347
IS PARITY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT

01:22:32.414 --> 01:22:33.448
OWNED NETWORKS AND THE PRIVATE

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:35.483

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:38.720

UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THIS IS

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:49.664
SOMETHING VERY VERY IMPORTANT

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:51.499
FOR US ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:53.535
THAT WILL HELP EACH AND

NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE IT

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.048
GLARINGLY CLEAR THAT WHILE

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:42.384
CONNECTIVITY IS CRITICAL IN

01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:44.252
NORMAL TIMES IT CAN MEAN THE

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:46.488
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:48.423

AND GUNS ACT BILLETS. THOSE

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:59.547
PARTICULAR OF HOUSES WAS BUILT

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:00.715
IN A TIME WHERE THEY HAVE

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:02.684
CENTER BLOCK WALLS WHAT DOES

WALLS ARE MADE OUT OF CONCRETE.

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:14.896

ABOUT DISTANCE LEARNING BUT

01:27:20.768 --> 01:27:21.336
THERE WAS NO DISTANCE LEARNING

01:27:21.402 --> 01:27:23.004

WE'RE NOT DOING ANY DISTANCE

01:27:31.412 --> 01:27:31.946
LEARNING BECAUSE THEY HAD NO

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:33.815
ABILITY TO DO IT. BECAUSE THEY

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:35.216
HAD NO INTERNET THERE WAS NO

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:36.718
THERE WAS NO CONNECTIVE ITTY TO

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:39.454
THE INTERNET. ACCESS WHATSOEVER

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.189
IN THOSE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS

01:27:41.255 --> 01:27:42.824
IN WHICH I REPRESENT. AND

01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:44.292
THAT'S THE SAME FOR THOSE EAST

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:45.994
LOS ANGELES ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.596
CALIFORNIA 40% OF CALIFORNIANS

01:27:48.663 --> 01:27:51.366
DUNCAN IS NOT CONNECTED. SO

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:52.166
WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT TO

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:53.668
CALIFORNIANS. WE'RE TALKING

01:27:53.735 --> 01:27:56.070
ABOUT A CALIFORNIA THAT IS

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:58.072
CONNECTED. TO THE PRIVILEGE AND

01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:59.540
ONE THAT IS NOT CONNECTED AND

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:01.809
DISENFRANCHISED. AND THAT'S THE

01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:05.046
PROBLEM THAT WE CAN NOT FORGET

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:07.048
ABOUT THE LEAST OF THESE. I

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:08.316
BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:09.484

PART OF THE LEAST OF THESE THE

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:18.393
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. SO WE

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:21.963
TO HAMMER OUT THE LANGUAGE I

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:23.731

WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO YES WE

01:28:27.168 --> 01:28:27.769
