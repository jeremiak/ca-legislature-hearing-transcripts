RETIREMENT SO SECURITY COMMITTEE. BEFORE WE BEGIN I HAVE A FEW ANNOUNCEMENTS TO MAKE THIS MORNIN. FIRST MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER TRAVIS ALLEN IS ABSENT TODAY AND NO SUBSTITUTE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE COMMITTEE. SECOND WE HAVE SEVENTEEN ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TODAY. FILE ITEM NUMBER TO SP FOUR FIFTY NINE PORTANTINO HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR. FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN SP ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE PAN. AND FILE ITEM FOURTEEN S. B. TWELVE SEVEN DIVIDE ACT OR ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. AND ALSO WILL TAKE UP THE CONSENT CALENDAR SINCE WE HAVE A QUORUM. SO WITH THAT TO IN GO AHEAD. WE GO AHEAD AND PRESENT -- SENATOR JACKSON. YOU HOW PHONE NUMBER EIGHTEEN SJR -- TWENTY FOUR YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY [inaudible] ALSO [inaudible] OKAY FUND. IT DOES MATTER WHICH I REALLY. WE GO IN ORDER. YES BOTTOM [inaudible] FIFTEEN THIRTEEN TWELVE GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF MY ON BEHALF OF MY THE JOINT AUTHORS SENATORS JOSH NEWMAN I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT S. B.. THIRTEEN TWELVE THIS IS A CLEAN UP MEASURE THAT MODIFIES DISABLED VETERAN SICKLY BENEFITS FOR STATE WORKERS TO MATCH THOSE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. TO PUBLIC SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN I CARRIED TWO BILLS THAT AUTHORIZED TO LIMITED ALLOTMENT OF SPECIAL SICK LEAVE. FOR DISABLED VETERANS WHO HAD BEEN NEWLY HIRED INTO PUBLIC SERVICE. ONE BILL PROVIDED THE BENEFIT THE STATE WORKERS. THE OTHER BILL PROVIDED IT TO SCHOOL EMPLOYEES BOTH BILLS PASSED THE LEGISLATURE UNANIMOUSLY AND WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE GOAL OF THESE MEASURES WAS TO PROVIDE A CUSHION OF SICKLY FOR DISABLED VETERANS WHO ARE TRANSITIONING FROM MILITARY SERVICE. BACK INTO OF CIVILIAN LIFE AND SPECIFICALLY IN TO SCHOOL ARE OR STATES SERVICE. THE NEWLY HIRED EMPLOYEES WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE BENEFIT IF AT THE TIME OF THEIR HIRING. THEY WERE MILITARY VETERANS WITH SERVICE CONNECTED HEALTH CONDITIONS. RATED BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AS 30% OR MORE DISABLED. THIS SICK LEAVE MAY BE USED ONLY TO TREAT SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS AND IS SUBJECT TO STRICT CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. TO ENSURE AGAINST MISUSE. STATE WORKERS RECEIVE TWELVE SICK LEAVE DAYS SCHOOL EMPLOYEES RECEIVE TEN DAYS A FOR CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES. AND TWELVE DAYS FOR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES BELIEVE MUST BE TAKEN WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER WHICH ANY UNUSED LEAVE IS FORFEITED AGAIN THE GOAL IS AS THEY TRANSITION BACK AND THEY HAVE THE NEED FOR SERVICES. THEY SHOULDN'T BE OF PROHIBITED OR DISCOURAGED FROM TAKING THAT NECESSARY TREATMENT AYE AS THEY TRANSITION BACK INTO A CIVILIAN LIFE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SEATS US SENATOR NEWMAN ASKED A FURTHER QUESTION WHAT IF A STATE ARE SCHOOL EMPLOYEE NOT A NEW HIRE BUT IN EXISTING EMPLOYEE WAS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL GUARD OR RESERVES. WHO WAS MOBILIZED ON TO ACTIVE DUTY WAS INJURED OR BECAME ILL DURING THAT DUTY AND THEN RETURN TO CALIFORNIA TO THEIR STATE OR SCHOOL JOB? WITH A QUALIFYING SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITION THAT NEEDED TREATMENT. CLEARLY THESE CATEGORIES OF RETURNING DISABLED SERVICE MEMBERS ARE TO BE AFFORDED TRANSITIONAL SICK LEAVE AS WELL SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE TREATMENT FOR THEIR INJURIES WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE LEAVE. WITHOUT PAY. SO LAST YEAR SENATOR NEWMAN AND I JOINTLY AUTHORED TWO ADDITIONAL BILLS TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR EXISTING EMPLOYEES WHO ARE GUARD MEMBERS OR RESERVISTS. BUT THERE'S STILL WALKING GROUP OF DISABLED VETERANS NOT COVERED. CURRENT STATE OR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO ARE THAT NEITHER NEW HIRES NOR GUARD MEMBERS BUT HAVE NEVER THE LESS HAVE PRE EXISTING SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS FROM EARLIER MILITARY SERVICE. IN THE ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES VETERAN BILL WAS AMENDED TO CLOSE A FINAL COVERAGE GAP. AND OFFER ADDITIONAL SICK LEAVE TO SERVICE MEMBERS WITH PRIOR EXISTING INJURIES BUT LAST YEAR'S OTHER BILL. PERTAINING TO DISABLED VETERANS STATE EMPLOYEES DID NOT GET THAT LOOPHOLE FIXING AMENDMENT AND CONTINUE TO ADD COVERAGE. ONLY FOR GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS. THIS YEAR'S BILL S. B. THIRTEEN TWELVE WILL BRING DISABLED VETERAN SICKLY FOR STATE EMPLOYEES UP TO PARITY WITH THE BENEFIT LEVEL THAT WE PROVIDE CURRENTLY FOR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. WITH THIS BILL ALL DISABLED SERVICE EXCUSE ME ALL DISABLED VETERANS IN STATE SERVICE WILL BE COVERED EQUALLY AND FAIRLY TO THE SAME BENEFITS STANDARD AND THE SAME ACCOUNTABILITY. WISHES WEREN'T SO COMPLICATED BUT YOU KNOW WE DO THINGS INCREMENTALLY. AND THIS WAS THAT ONE OF THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT BIT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO FIX SO -- IT'S AN IMPORTANT FIX FOR THOSE WHO NEED THE SERVICES IT'S NOT A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE BUT IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL. A POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE A SERVE THEIR COUNTRY AND DESERVE THE THESE PROTECTIONS AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU TO ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS STILL OUR STORY AND FLOORS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORTED THIS BILL LAST YEAR WHEN IT PROVIDED THE SAME SICKLY BENEFIT TO ACTIVE DUTY. CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES THIS IS A PARODY DEL AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT IT THANK YOU. ANYONE IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS TWENTY MEMBERS. I EXPLANATION JUST SAY YOU'RE. YOU INTENDED UNIFORMITY ACROSS OUR WORKFORCE YOU IDENTIFIED A AREA WHERE YOU DIDN'T HAVE YOUR COMPLETE IN THAT. THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL A MOVE THE BILL WE HAVE OUR QUORUM. THANK YOU SENATE LIKE CLOSE. OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PUT IT PERFECTLY AND INTO. IF I WERE TO DO IT OVER AGAIN I TRY THAT APPROACH AND THEN SOMEONE MIGHT SAY WHAT THE HECK IS THIS BILL ALL ABOUT. BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT BILL AND I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU FOR MUCH AS WELL I DO HAVE US SUPPORT ON THIS AS SOON AS WE GET A QUORUM WILL BRING UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU AND THEN I HAVE ONE OTHER. YES NEXT ONE IS FILE ITEM ARE. TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSUS IS A RESOLUTION CALLING ON CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT TO ADOPT A COMPREHENSIVE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN AND ALSO CALLING ON CALPERS TO DIVEST ITS GUN HOLDINGS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT AFTER THE LATEST SHOOTINGS WHERE WE SAW THAT THE BOMB STOCK OF BEING USED AND THERE WAS A CALL TO AT LEAST BAND THAT'S IN THERE WAS A PROMISE THAT WOULD HAPPEN. NOTHING HAS HAPPENED ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. AND RAPID FIRE ASSAULT WEAPONS WITH LARGE CLIPS OF AMMUNITION HAVE ONLY ONE PURPOSE THE MASS SLAUGHTER OF LARGE NUMBERS OF HUMAN BEINGS. THERE THESE OF WEAPONS ARE DESIGNED FOR MILITARY USE TO ACHIEVE THAT MISSION IN COMBAT. FOR NEARLY EIGHTY YEARS EIGHTY YEARS FEDERAL LAW HAS BANNED MACHINE GUNS GRENADES AND BOMBS OTHER WEAPONS OF WAR LIKE ASSAULT WEAPONS. THAT ARE SIMPLY TOO DANGEROUS TO BE IN CIVILIAN HANDS. CONGRESS PASSED AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN THIS PART OF THE VIOLENT CRIME CONTROL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR BUT AS WE ALL KNOW. IT EXPIRED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND WAS NOT RENEWED. BEFORE ITS EXPIRATION. THE FEDERAL ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL SHOOTING VICTIMS BY FIFTY FOUR POINT 4% ACCORDING TO A QUINNIPIAC UNIVERSITY STUDY. COMPARED WITH A TEN YEAR PERIOD BEFORE THE BAND WAS IN PLACE THE NUMBER OF MASS SHOOTINGS DURING THE BAND FELL BY 37%. AND THE NUMBER PEOPLE DYING FROM MASS SHOOTINGS BY 43% BUT AFTER THE BAN LAPSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THE NUMBER SHOT UP AGAIN. AND IT'S TARNISHING ONE HUNDRED AND 83% INCREASE IN GUN MASSACRES AND TWO HUNDRED AND THE ONLY GUN CONTROL MEASURE THAT HAS TO HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IS THE FEDERAL ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. IT'S GOAL IS TO STEM HORRIFIC MASS SHOOTING INCIDENTS IT WON'T STOP EVERY GUN MASSACRE WE KNOW THAT BUT IT WILL CUT DOWN ON THEIR CARNAGE. IT WILL ALSO REDUCE THE PROBLEMS OF POROUS BORDERS FOR STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT A PASSED TOUGH GUN CONTROL LAWS AND YET WITH OTHER STATES BY HAVING LACKS LAWS. PEOPLE CAN SIMPLY TRANSPORT THESE FIREARMS IN THE CALIFORNIA THIS HAS TO BE TAKEN ON A NATIONAL LEVEL AS WELL. IN LIGHT OF THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENT POLICIES. TO MATCH THE VIEWS OF THE STATE'S CITIZENS AND TO STAND UP. AND START SHOULD TAKE A STAND WITH THE VICTIMS OF THESE HORRIFIC CRIMES CAL STIRS HAS ALREADY TAKEN THE STEP OF THE VESTING ITS HOLDINGS INCOME MANUFACTURE. PERHAPS REALIZING THE DISCONNECT RETIREES INVESTMENTS AND TEACHERS MISSION OF KEEPING STUDENTS SAY FROM THE CLASSROOM. AND FURTHER AS PRESSURE IS MOUNTING ON WALL STREET TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE. I BELIEVE THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME FOR US AS A STATE THE CALL UPON CALPERS INVESTMENT FIRMS AND OTHERS WHO ARE ALSO RE EXAMINING THEIR PORTFOLIOS MANY OF WHICH ARE DROPPING GUN STOCKS. AND ASKING WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE THEIR PRODUCTS DON'T END UP IN A MASS SHOOTING. SEVERAL MAJOR RETAILERS INCLUDING DICK'S SPORTING GOODS HAVE DECIDED TO STOP SELLING A STALLED STYLE WEAPONS ALL TOGETHER AND OTHERS LIKE WALMART WILL BE RAISING THE AGE TO PURCHASE A FIREARM IN THEIR STORES. TO TWENTY ONE IN SHORT THEY HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT GUNS ARE BAD FOR BUSINESS AND CAL STIRS I BELIEVE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REINFORCE THEIR POSITION. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER ANYBODY IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE SOME RECURRENT. MACHINERY EQUIPMENT COMMITTEE CRAIG DELUDE UP AFTER THE FIRES POLICY COALITION UP I YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT KNOW THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A RESOLUTION THAT SAYS. A WE DON'T LIKE IT CONSTITUTIONALLY ENUMERATED RIGHT WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT -- THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS IS A NOTED IN OUR CONSTITUTION THIS THERE FOR A REASON. RIGHTS THAT OUR NUMERATOR THAT OUR CONSTITUTION ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE CONVENE. THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH ISN'T THERE TO BURST PROTECT SPEECH THAT WITH WHICH WE ALL AGREE. IN FACT IS THERE TO PROTECT SPEECH WHICH SOME MAY FIND OBJECTIONABLE. AND I UNDERSTAND WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE SOME PEOPLE WELL THEY CHOOSE NOT TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS BUT FOR THE STATE GOVERNMENT FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PUT FORTH A RESOLUTION BASICALLY DECRYING. THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS AND LET US BE CLEAR THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN ASSAULT. WEAPON THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN ASSAULT STYLE WEAPONS THERE HAVE BEEN NO REAL SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE TYPE OF FIREARMS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE A ARE FIFTEEN WHICH IS. KIND OF THE TARGET IN PARTICULAR OF OF RESOLUTIONS LIKE THIS HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE. NINETEEN FIFTY NINE WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS NOT A GUN PROBLEM IT'S NOT A TOOL PROBLEM IT IS A PEOPLE PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS AN ISSUE WITHIN OUR SOCIETY THAT NEEDS TO BE TO ADDRESS. THIS NOT A GUN VIOLENCE THAT YOU IT IS A VIOLENCE ISSUE ONE THAT WE DO TO SERIOUSLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT BUT AS LONG AS WE ARE GOING TO AS A SOLUTION SEEK TO DISARM. LAW ABIDING CITIZENS AND USE THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT -- TO PRESSURE BUSINESSES OF WHO ARE ENGAGING IN THE FACILITATION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT I THINK THAT WE ARE OVERSTEPPING OUR BOUNDS AND IS THIS FOR IS FOR THIS REASON. THAT I ASK THAT YOU OPPOSE THIS MAY THANK YOU. THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION SEEING NONE. THE NAME MEMBERS. MANY MEMBERS INCOME IT'S SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE TO A REF REFERENCING THE FIRST AMENDMENT -- THE GENTLEMAN SUPPORTING THE UNFETTERED RIGHT TO OWN FIREARMS FORGETS THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THAT IS WITHOUT A LIMITATION. AND UP UNTIL THE HELLER CASE WE HAD TO A AFFIRMATIONS THAT A THE SOCIETY AND A PUBLIC SAFETY TO WARRANT. A IN INSTANCES WHERE GUNS ARE REGULATED. THE WAY SPEECH WE DO NOT ALLOW SOMEONE TO YELL FIRE IN A MOVIE THEATER BECAUSE IT IS A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. FIRE ARMS AND SPECIFICALLY IN THIS INSTANCE ASSAULT TYPE WEAPONS ARE A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. THE STATISTICS DEMONSTRATE WE DO HAVE A GUN VIOLENCE PROBLEM WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE KILLED EVERY YEAR IN GUN VIOLENCE AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE TALKING HERE ABOUT LIMITING. A THE WEAPONS OF WAR IS IN NO WAY AN IMPAIRMENT OF ANYONE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. AND IF YOU RECALL THAT THE SECOND AMENDMENT STARTS WITH THE PHRASE A WELL REGULATED MILITIA. BEING NECESSARY TO THE SECURITY OF A FREE STATE. ARE IT IS APPALLING TO ME THAT THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE HEAR IGNORE. CONTEXT OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND ALSO IGNORE THE STATEMENT BY ONE ANTONIN SCALIA IN THE HELLER CASE WHICH AFFIRMED THE FACT THAT OF THE RIGHT TO OWN RIGHT. THIS IS A REASONABLE MEASURE THIS WILL HOPEFULLY SAVE LIVES -- THERE IS A RIGHT TO LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS THAT I BELIEVE I IS CHALLENGED WHEN WE ALLOW WEAPONS OF WAR LIKE THE WEAPONS THAT ARE ON THE STREETS TODAY. TO GO A TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO SEEKS THEM WITH THAT I WOULD URGE DRIVE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR AND AS YOU SEE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM MINUTES WE CAN BRING ARE FOR VOTE FOR HAVE LONG COLLEGE YOU GET A QUORUM THANK YOU [inaudible] THIRD MEMBERS. SO NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR LEYVA I THOUGHT I CYNICAL ON IT. SENATOR WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR PROTECTS THE RETRY RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF CALPERS MEMBERS BY MAKING SURE THAT ANY COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED COMPENSATION TOWARDS RETIREMENT CANNOT BE FORCED TO BE PAID BACK. TO INCORRECTLY REPORTED INFORMATION BY THEIR EMPLOYERS THIS MAJOR RESPONSE TO INTO INSTANCES WHERE THE COMPENSATION INFORMATION OF RETIRED EMPLOYEES WAS MISCALCULATED FOR INCORRECTLY REPORTED TO CALPERS. BY THEIR EMPLOYERS IN THESE INSTANCES THE RETIRED EMPLOYEES ARE FORCED TO PAY BACK THE OVERPAID AMOUNT AND EVEN SUFFER REDUCTIONS IN FUTURE PAYMENTS. THESE RETIRED EMPLOYEES MANY TIMES IF NOT ALL THE TIME RELY ON THEIR FIXED INCOME AND SHOULD NOT HAVE TO TAKE UNEXPECTED CUTS TO THEIR BENEFITS. S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR GIVES RETIREES THE PEACE OF MIND THAT THEY WILL NOT BE FORCED TO PAY BACK MONEY OR HAVE REDUCTIONS IN THEIR FUTURE PAYMENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR PLAYERS ACCOUNTING ERROR OR A REPORTING HERE.

CHRISTIANITY THE MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY VALMONT BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. PLEASED TO BE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE. BUT YOU KNOW WE HAD A MEMBER START COMING TO US. WELL ONE PARTICULAR STORY WOULD SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE IN TWENTY TWELVE A FIREFIGHTER WHO -- WAS A FIREFIGHTER FOR THE CITY DAVIS FOR THIRTY YEARS. AHEAD RETIRED FOR FIVE YEARS AND THEN RECEIVED A LETTER IN THE MAIL. UP FROM THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM SUGGESTING THAT. THE EMPLOYER ALTHOUGH BARGAIN FOR A BENEFIT. PROMISED IT INTO RETIREMENT PAID FOR IT. SHE BOTH PAID FOR AS WELL AS HER EMPLOYER THROUGHOUT HER CAREER. THAT THEY NOW WOULD LIKE A REMITTANCE OF A DIFFERENCE WHAT THEY'VE DETERMINIST BEEN DISALLOWED. OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF MONEY AND PERMANENTLY REDUCED THAT ALLOW IT'S GOING FORWARD IN PERPETUITY WHILE THIS MEMBER. GAVE HER LIFE TO THE FIRE SERVICE AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND THEN HAS BEEN BECAUSE OF AN ACTION OF THE EMPLOYER. HOPE IS THE ONE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG IN THE OBLIGATION. BECAUSE OF THIS BILL APPROPRIATELY CORRECTS THAT AND PROTECTS A RETIREE DOES NOTHING FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN TO SEND THEM BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE BUT IF YOU'VE ALREADY MADE THE ACTION TO RETIRE. THE BILL REQUIRES THE EMPLOYER TO MAKE THE PAYMENT BACK TO THE SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM HOLE AND ALSO TO ASSUME ANY UNFUNDED ACTUARIAL LIABILITY THAT MAY RESULT FROM CONTINUING THAT BENEFIT GOING FORWARD. SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THINK ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MUCH. SEEING NONE ANY COMMERCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENIOR CENTER LIKE BECAUSE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW WORKERS BOB MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE PROMISES THAT THEY'RE MADE BY THEIR EMPLOYERS THEY MAKE CAREER DECISIONS TO GIVE ALL THE BEST YEARS OF THEIR LIFE.

SO POUND ONE START NAY OF A COUPLE SO START WITH THE NUMBER FOUR SB [inaudible] SEVEN EIGHTY THREE ARE THEY IF YOU GOOD MORNING [inaudible] SO. THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING HERE I SP SEVEN EIGHTY THREE MAKES A REQUEST BY THE LEGISLATURE TO UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TO DEVELOP A PENSION DIVESTMENT REVIEW PROGRAM. TO ASSESS THE INVESTMENT PROPOSAL SIMILAR IN A MANNER. TO THE EXISTING PROCESS UNDER DICK CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFIT REVIEW PROGRAM SHOULD BURKE. EVENT WHICH LEADS THEY PROPOSALS PROPOSALS TO MANDATE HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFIT COVERAGE. IT PROVIDES THE LEGISLATIVE HERS COMMITTEE CHAIRS THE SENATE PRO TEM AND ASSEMBLY SPEAKER. NEWT FIRST BILL TO BE RID VIEWED BY AT THE PD R. P. WHICH WILL PROVIDE ITS ANALYSIS TO THE CORPORATE POLICY FISCAL COMMITTEES. NOT LATER THAN SIXTY DAYS AFTER RECEIVING REQUESTS THEY ALSO REQUESTED UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA COLLABORATE WITH ACTUARIES RECOMMEND BY THE CALIFORNIA ACTUARIAL ADVISORY PANEL. EXPERTS IN THE PUBLIC PENSION FUND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONS WELL AS USE UNIVERSITY RESOURCES THAT% SPECIALIZE IN PROVIDING OBJECTIVE FINANCIAL POLICY ANALYSES. ALSO PROVIDES THAT TWO MILLION APPROPRIATION TO PROVIDE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM. AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS PANEL IS REALLY TO ESTABLISH A DISPASSIONATE ANALYTICAL METHOD. USING CLEAR CRITERIA TO ADD VALUE EACH LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL TO THE VAST TO RESTRICT PENSION FUND INVESTMENTS. FOR THE PROPOSAL'S. BOTH IN TERMS OF COST ACHIEVING PROPOSALS INTENDED POLICY OBJECTIVE IN ORDER AT THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE RECEIVED CURRENT ACCURATE DATA INFORMATION WHEN CONSIDERING PROPOSAL. YEAH I WOULD MAKE NOTES THAT CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA. PROFESSORS AND ACTUALLY STANDS BY ITS VALUES IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO SO IT'S ALSO WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR RETIREMENT AND INVESTMENT SPURS. HELPERS AND CAL STIRS OUR EXISTS TO ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT DUE RETIREMENT. OF OUR STATE EMPLOYEES ARE TEACHERS ARE OTHER -- GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE WELL INFORMED IN MAKING ANY SORT OF DECISION THAN LOOKING AT THE RIGHT DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES THAT WE HAVE BEEN. TO ENSURE THAT WE ADVANCE OUR ARE EVER VALUE SO WITH THAT UMP RESPECT WE ASK WHEN I VOTE AND HAVE WITNESSES SUPPORT. AGAIN CORBETT FIGURES TO CALIFORNIA'S CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFIT REVIEW PROGRAM WILL DISCUSS HOW THIS PROGRAM WORKS -- IN TERMS OF SUCH A BIRD THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER SUPPORT. GLENN BRING JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE IT WE THINK THAT THAT'S A SUB POP WILL APPROACH. TO TRY TO GRAPPLE WITH THE MULTITUDE OF AREAS THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED WHEN IT COMES TO DIVESTMENT LEGISLATION WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS IS THE LEGISLATURE HAS VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE POLICY AND MORAL ISSUES. THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND NEED TO BE DISCUSSED IN OUR CERTAINLY WITHIN THE JURISDICTION IN PURVIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE. OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION IT'S HAS ALSO SET UP A MECHANISM TO TRY TO BETTER ASSESS THE LONG TERM FISCAL IMPACT OF THE FUND WHICH HAS A MAJOR IMPORTANT ON RETIREMENT STABILITY FOR OUR MEMBERS. WHICH IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE OF THE RECENT PENSION REFORM ACT THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATURE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. I NEW TEACHERS THAT YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO RECRUIT A RETAIN OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS ARE GOING TO BEEP FACING A 1% -- INCREASE IN THEIR RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO CASTERS BEGINNING ON JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR THIS KIND OF INFORMATION IS NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD AND IF YOU WERE TO PASS A BASEMENT LEGISLATION THAT CAN HAVE A FISCAL IMPACT ON THE FUHRMAN. DOCKING HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON A NEW TEACHERS SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO CONSIDER THE POLICIES THAT YOU WANT TO CONSIDER WHEN IT COMES TO DIVESTMENT BUT ALSO THE RETIREMENT POLICY ON HOW IT MIGHT IMPACT THE RETIREMENT SECURITY OF OUR CURRENT EDUCATORS AS WELL AS OUR FEW EDUCATORS FOR THOSE. REASONS WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. YOU WANT SUPPORT DAVE WALRATH REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. IN ADDITION TO THE COMMENTS MADE ALREADY BY CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WIN SUPPORT THE BILL WE SUPPORT THE THIRD PARTY ANALYSIS PROCESS. NOT BECAUSE WE DO NOT TRUST CALPERS MCALISTER'S. BUT BECAUSE FREQUENTLY THERE ARE QUESTIONS ASKED. ABOUT WHETHER THEY HAD A A SOME ON THE SCALE. A WE DON'T BELIEVE THEY DO BUT THIS WILL ENSURE THAT IT IS A NEUTRAL THIRD PARTY ANALYSIS. THAT ALL PEOPLE CAN WORK WITH WE SUPPORT THE TEMPLATE -- PROCESS IN LOOKING AT FIRST ENGAGEMENT. CARTER GOING INTO A DIVERTISSEMENT PROCESS IT IS HARD TO CHANGE A FIRM'S BEHAVIOR IF YOU'RE NOT AT THE TABLE AND WHEN YOU'RE DIVESTITURE NO LONGER AT THE TABLE. WE BELIEVE ENGAGEMENT SHOULD ALWAYS BE TRIED FIRST WE BELIEVE IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND NUMBER OF CASES. OUGHT AND FOR THAT REASON WE BELIEVE THIS BILL STRIKES A VERY GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE'S OBLIGATIONS AND RIGHTS. I AS FAR AS SAY POLICY IN ASSURING THAT THE OBLIGATIONS OF PENSION SYSTEMS ARE MATT AND THE PROVISION OF SERVICES AND BENEFITS. TO MEMBERS AND RETIREES ARE MET FOR THOSE REASONS WERE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE SPORT. GOOD MORNING DEREK CLINICS ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL PLAYER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT ASSOCIATION CLAPPING SUPPORT. GOOD MONEY VINE GOT REAL WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING TERM MEMBERS START THE JOHNS WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES PLEASES SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TED TOP AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE RETIREES STRONGLY IN SUPPORT. WE HAVE BEEN -- STRONG ADVOCATES FOR ENGAGEMENT AND NOT DIVESTMENT WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD [inaudible] WHICH NEITHER. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT ANYONE OPPOSITION. WE HAVE SOMEBODY COME. YES MY NECK MY NAME IS. IT DIDN'T PLAN IS PRISTINE SHOEMAKER I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF PALM THREE FIFTY BAY AREA LEGISLATIVE ACTION TEAM. AND WE DID SUBMIT A LETTER IN OPPOSITION I THINK IT WAS A LITTLE BIT LATE BUT I THINK IT'S ON YOUR LIST OF OF LATE LETTERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY COMES COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUT YES I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IS ONE TO THINK THE OFFER FOR THIS EFFORT RELEASE APPROACH. I THINK IT'S A WISER APPROACH A MUCH MORE THOROUGH APPROACH AND WE GET A BUNCH OF DIVESTMENT BILLS EVERY YEAR EVERY YEAR RIGHT AND REALLY I THINK WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE. GOING FOR MISTER CHARGED THAT RECOMMENDATION FOR THE COMMITTEE MAYBE NEXT YEAR IS THAT. WHEN SOMEONE DOES WALK UP WITH A DIVESTMENT BILL I THINK THEY NEED TO IDENTIFY -- WHERE THEY CAN GET THE DOLLARS TO OFFSET THE LOSSES FOR THEIR PROPOSAL -- BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PENSION -- PROBLEM IN THIS STATE AND OBLIGATIONS. TO AND THIS IS MEMBERS MONEY IT DOESN'T MONEY THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN JUST TAKE AND DO WHAT THEY WANT. OR NOT WANT WITH -- BUT THAT WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH I THINK THIS IS A MORE THOUGHTFUL APPROACH [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUICK. SOME ARE BROKEN THING WAS CHAIR -- NOT A BIG FAN OF THE INVESTMENT I THINK IT'S DEFICIENT RESPONSIBILITIES FUNDS GET THE MAXIMUM PROFIT FOR THEIR MEMBERS HOWEVER -- IN CALIFORNIA DIVESTITURE IS A REALITY SAW BE SPORTING A BILL TODAY. ONE QUESTION -- IS IS JUST LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS ARE SAFE CALLOUSED OURS BOARD DECIDES TO DIVEST IN A CERTAIN INDUSTRY A PRODUCT DOES THAT GO THROUGH THIS COMMISSION PROCESSORS AT JUST THE LEGISLATURE. SO THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY FOR LEGISLATION SO BECAUSE BUT CERTAINLY IT WITHIN THAT OF RACE PENSION FUNDS -- THEY IN MAKING THOSE DECISIONS ARE AND THEY CAN SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES BUT I AM AWARE THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT SILLY THEIR INVESTMENT PERSON NOW. ARE. I'D GO OVER AND PRESENT TO THEM YOU KNOW WHAT THAT POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES ARE THEY DO HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY. ARE UNDER LAW -- AND I THINK EVEN UNDER THE CONSTITUTION TO TO TO BE SURE WE GET THAT I RETURN THE CHALLENGES IS THAT WHAT I'M SOME WE AS THE LEGISLATURE GIVE DIRECTION -- WHAT THIS BILL AND PROCESS DOES IS THAT IT HELPS INFORM THAT SO THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE MAY PREFER BROWN THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL SAYS WE CAN'T PASSIVE INVESTMENT BILL?

NOW BOTH OF THE THE FUNDS HAVE BOTH OF THE THE PLANS HAVE GOVERNS DIRECTIVES THAT ADVISE THEM TO TAKE CLIMB RISK INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THEIR INVESTMENT DECISIONS. OUR CLIMATE CHANGE POSES FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF RISK TO THE VALUE OF FUND ASSETS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. BY FUN FIDUCIARY THIS INCLUDE PHYSICAL RISK. TRANSITION RISK STRANDED ASSET RISK. LITIGATION RISK SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU KNOW. IF I IF YOU THINK ABOUT BUYING WHAT A REAL ESTATE ON THE COAST IN BANGLADESH.

NOW GLOBALLY THESE RISKS AND HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR THEM OF BEING TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN FRANCE BECAME THE FIRST COUNTRY TO REQUIRE MANDATORY CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED REPORTING. FOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT THEN PROCEEDED. THE NEXT YEAR AND IN APPROVING A DIRECTIVE REQUIRING PENSION FUNDS TO ASSESS CLIMB A RISK ALONG WITH OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL. AND GOVERNANCE RISKS IN THEIR INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND TO INFORM FUND MEMBERS AND FIT AND BENEFIT BENEFICIARIES OF THEIR FINDINGS. CALIFORNIA'S LEAD THE WAY ON SO MANY THINGS RELATING TO CLIMATE CHANGE. OUR PENSION FUNDS ARE ALREADY LEADING THE WAY AND ENSURING THAT BICYCLING RISK IS BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY. WITHIN THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY WILL GET THE STRESS AS THEY OUGHT TO TAKE. INTO ACCOUNT THE REALITY OF CLIMATE.

EVEN AFTER INFUSION OF SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET TOM ADDRESSING CONCERNS FROM WITH LEGISLATION THAT DIVEST. OR OPEN THE DOOR INVESTMENT.

COOPER THE VOTING. COOPER NOT VOTING O'DONNELL. BELONG THOSE LOCAL PICK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT UP IS THERE MORE LUCK S. B. SIX BY. SIX GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING CHAIR [inaudible] BLUEBOOK [inaudible] BUT FROM. IF IT IS A LOT OF WORK IN THIS BILL -- S. B. SIX FIFTY SIX IS AN ATTEMPT TO MODIFY A RETIREMENT PLAN THAT HAS FALLEN SHORT AND PROVIDING AN APPROPRIATE INCOMPARABLE RETIREMENT SYSTEM FOR THOSE SERVING. OUR STATE WITH DILIGENCE ON THE BENCH IN THE JUDICIARY. COLLEAGUES IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR A SECOND TIER PENSION PLAN WAS ESTABLISHED FOR NEW JUDGE'S KNOWN AS J. R. AS TO JUDGE RETIREMENT SYSTEM. TO MAKE IT AS A HYBRID DEFINED CONTRIBUTION DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN. AND IT HAS COMPONENTS THAT WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT LOOKS LIKE THE PLAN THAT WAS CREATED BY COMMITTEE. THE NET RESULT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS THE ONLY PUBLIC EMPLOYEE GROUP NOT IN A BONAFIDE. DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN. AS A LONG TIME. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN REFORMER I HAD TO CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL. OUT WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROCESS LAST YEAR THE FIRST. IS THE PRINCIPLE OF NO BETTER NO WORSE. THE STATE SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES CANNOT OBTAIN THE DEFINED BENEFIT UNLESS THEY HAVE WORKED TWENTY YEARS AND REACH AGE. SIXTY FIVE THOSE STARTING BEFORE THE AGE OF FORTY FIVE MUST WORK EXTRA YEARS. THOSE APPOINTED AFTER FORTY FIVE MINUTES WORK PAST AGE SIXTY FIVE OR TO AGE. SEVENTY DOES NOT MEETING THESE PECULIAR REQUIREMENTS WILL RECEIVE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS BACK PLUS INTEREST PLUS A STATE MANDATED 10% MATCH. THEREFORE IF HEALTH CONCERNS ARISE. THE JUDGE IS NOT REELECTED. WHICH THEY ARE UP EVERY SIX YEARS IF A SPOUSE NEEDS CRITICAL ATTENTION AND THE JUDGE. NEEDS TO THE HUSBAND NEEDS TO STOP AND PAY ATTENTION TO THE SPOUSE OR IF A JUDGE DIES PREMATURELY THEN THE JUDGE AND FAMILY HAVE A MORE DIFFICULT QUANDARY. THAT THE JUDGE FIGHTING CANCER CONTINUE TO WORK TO REACH TWENTY YEARS ARE. EIGHT SEVENTY THIS IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE LEASE INCENTIVIZE SYSTEM. AND IF EQUALITY IS ARE BUZZWORD HERE THEN SOMETHING MUST BE DONE. THE SECOND CONCERN FOR THE CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER WITH COST. OTHER MODIFICATIONS HAD TO BE AS COST NEUTRAL AS POSSIBLE. ACCORDING TO A DECEMBER ELEVENTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN ACTUARIAL COST ANALYSIS BY CALPERS S. B. SIX FIVE SIX WOULD COST WOULD ONLY COST TWO TWO POINT FOUR MILLION IN THE FIRST YEAR. ACCORDING TO THAT REPORT THE TWENTY YEAR PERIOD ESTIMATED. TO BE ABOUT NINETEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION OR ROUGHLY ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN JANUARY ON THE TWENTY THIRD IN THERE MEMO FOR THE FINANCE BILL ANALYSIS STATED. GENERAL FUND COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE UP UNDER 1-000-420-1819 EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND IN. NINETEEN TWENTY AND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE COLLEAGUES THIS IS NOT COST NEUTRAL BUT IT COMES AWFULLY CLOSE. AND WE CAN NEGOTIATED DOWN. IF IF NECESSARY BUT FOR ALL THE GOOD THIS EFFORT WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS COST IS A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT IN WRITING IRAN. COLLEAGUES I HAVE A FEW SIGNATURES. OF SUPPORT FROM OUR JUDGES YOUR REPORT SAYS I HAVE A FEW BUT I GOT OVER SIX HUNDRED SIGNATURES I'D LIKE [inaudible] TO POPE. IT STARTED HANDLES OUT TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS PLEASE AT SENATOR RICARDO LARA IS A JOINT AUTHORED. AN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BRO IN COOLEY ARE CO AUTHORS AND I THANK THEM. AND I HAVE. A REQUEST AFTER MORE TO BE TO BE ADDED ON THE LIST THAT YOU. BECAUSE WE MAY TAKE AN AMENDMENT AND APPROACHED -- I WANT EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE CALPERS FOR ITS ASSISTANCE IN PROVIDING AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. THEY'VE ASKED FOR ONE MORE TECHNICAL TRY I WILL HOPE TO MAKE AN APPROACH. BUT THIS BILL IT HAD NO OPPOSITION AND SINCE A STRONG SIGNAL TO THE JUDICIARY BRANCH THAT IT IS APPRECIATED. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OKAY WHAT MOTION A SECOND WHEN THIS IS A SUPPORT. WELL GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS LAURIE DAMELIN A JUDGE HERE IN SACRAMENTO WITH THE SUPERIOR COURT. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS AS A NEW JUDGE ON S. B.. SIX FIFTY SIX AM HERE TODAY NOT SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE SACRAMENTO SUPERIOR COURT FOR ON BEHALF OF ANY PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION BUT AS AN INDIVIDUAL JUDGE. I'M SEEING THIS THROUGH THE PRISM OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A MOTHER AS A WIFE A PERSON COMMITTED TO SERVING IN PUBLIC SERVICE FOR MANY YEARS TO COME -- I FEEL PRIVILEGED TO HAVE BEEN APPOINTED JUST DIED JUST LAST YEAR AND I REALLY SINCERELY HOPE THAT I HAVE THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE PLUS YEARS TO SERVE BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THINGS HAPPEN. AND DON'T ALWAYS GO AS EXPECTED IN THIS BILL REALLY ADDRESSES THAT REALITY. I'M CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE JUDGE STEVE PERK WHO EFFORT WAS FROM ORANGE COUNTY WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PANCREATIC CANCER AT AGE SIXTY THREE AND HAD BEEN ON THE BENCH. FOR NINETEEN YEARS -- DOCTORS GAVE HIM FOR SIX MONTHS TO LIVE FORTUNATELY HE LIVED LONGER THAN NOT THEY WERE WRONG BUT AT THE TIME HE KNEW HE HAD TO SURVIVE TO THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE TO GET A DEFINED BENEFIT FOR HIS WIFE -- A DISABILITY RETIREMENT WAS WORTH ABOUT A THIRD OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT PAYOUT HE HAD BEEN COUNTING ON FOR HIS FAMILY'S FINANCIAL SECURITY. AS WELL AS HE WAS OF S. B. SIX FIFTY SIX HAD BEEN LAW AT THE TIME HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED WHEN HE REACHED TWENTY YEARS OF SERVICE AND ASSURE HIS WIFE OF FINANCIAL SECURITY. BUT AS IT IS HIM PUTTING NEARLY A FULL YEAR AND THEY'LL HEALTH AFTER HIS TWENTY YEARS OF AND AT ITS TWENTY YEAR ANNIVERSARY AS A JUDGE JUST TO AVOID LEAVING HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE. WITH LESS THAN HALF OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT THEY WERE COUNTING ON THIS IS NOT THE ONLY JUDGE TO SEPARATE THIS KIND OF EXPERIENCE AND IT WON'T BE THE ONLY JUDGE AND CERTAINLY THIS COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE -- AS THE NEWLY APPOINTED JUDGE I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'M AWARE OF A NUMBER OF VERY HIGHLY WELL QUALIFIED -- LAWYERS IN THE COMMUNITY YOUNG AND DIVERSE LAWYERS WHO WOULD WHO MIGHT CONSIDER A JUDGESHIP BUT SEE THIS LACK OF SECURITY AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO PURSUING A JUDGESHIP. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THIS KIND OF CLIFF VESTING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR NOT EVEN IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR -- THIS LEGISLATION AS YOU'VE HEARD IS A VERY VERY MODEST FIX THAT WOULD HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT -- ON THE LIVES OF MY COLLEAGUES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES AND IN LIGHT OF THAT FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY. THREE I THOUGHT I KNEW. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON CAN'T HAMLIN A JUDGE FOR THE PRESIDENT'S PARACORD THE DIRECTOR OF THE ALLIANCE CALIFORNIA JUDGES SPONSOR. FOR SIX FIFTY SIX ADD THE JUDICIAL FAIRNESS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I WANT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU. I WILL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF UNLIKE THE LAWYERS WHO APPEAR IN MY COURT ALL MAKE GOOD ON THAT PROMISE -- I AS JUDGE HIM WELL POINTED OUT THERE ARE TRAGEDIES -- WITH I'LL ADD ONE MORE IT'S A GENTLEMAN SOUTH OF WHERE I AM IN TULARE COUNTY APPALLED BOARDMAN. A JUDGE MORGAN WAS DIAGNOSED WITH METASTATIC CANCER AT AGE -- SIXTY NINE HE KNEW THAT IF HE LAUGHED AND TOOK BACK HIS CONTRIBUTIONS PLUS INTEREST IT WOULD LEAVE HIS WIFE VERY LITTLE. FOR HER SECURITY. AND SO HE DRAGGED HIMSELF INTO WORK EVERYDAY UNTIL HE REACHED HIS SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY SO HE COULD RETIRE AND PREVENT SECURE THAT BENEFIT FOR HER FORTY DAYS LATER. NOW THERE IS NO REASON FOR THAT COURT TO SUFFER. THE LOSS OF HIS ABILITIES TO SERVE BOMBING I'M SURE HE DID HIS BEST BUT HOW MUCH CAN ONE DO IN ITS STATE. AND SO THE COURT HAD TO PICK UP THE SLACK AND CERTAINLY WAS A TRAGIC EXPERIENCE FOR HIM HIS WIFE TO WONDER IF HE WOULD EVEN MAKE IT TO THAT FINISH LINE. I'M. I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY MISTER BOLTON'S ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL IT'S THOROUGH AT SIX IT IT EXPLAINS ALL OF THE BEST ARGUMENTS. THE MOST IMPORTANT ARGUMENT TO MAKE IS THAT UNDER THIS BILL NO JUDGE GETS A DOLLAR MORE OR A DOLLAR A DAY SOONER. THAN THEY WOULD GET IF THEY STAYED ON UNTIL FINAL RETIREMENT AGE. IT'S SIMPLY ALLOWS THE JUDGE TO GET THE YEARS OF SERVICE THAT JUDGE HAS ACTUALLY SERVED. AT A LATER DATE. I AND ACTUALLY FORGO SOME INCREASES THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE OTHERWISE RECEIVED SOME JUDGES WILL TAKE LESS SOME WILL GET THE BENEFIT AT A LATER DATE THAT HAD THEY STAYED ON THE BENCH. A IT'S A VERY SMALL ASK BUT I THINK IT ADDRESSES THE MOST TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT ARE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE CLIFF VESTING FEATURE OF THIS BILL. SO ICE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR BUTTONS. FOR THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING I'M JUDGE MARIANNE GILLIARD I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU [inaudible] IF YOU. JUDGE ELIZABETH WITH IT I SUPPORT THIS BILL THINKING HELLO. JUDGE US IN THOSE IN SUPPORT AND FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER HAD FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER. GOOD MORNING I'M JUDGE STEVE WHITE THE PRESIDENT OF THE ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA JUDGES AND OF COURSE I SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT BILL. I'M JUDGE JOHN ADAMS MARCH COUNTY ALSO ALLIANCE DIRECTOR AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I THINK THOSE WHO HAVE HELPED US THIS FAR. JUDGE THOMAS LONG LOS ANGELES I ALSO SUPPORT THIS BILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MIKE BELOW IT SPEAKING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION WE AGREE THIS IS A WORTHY INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE J. HEIRESS UP PROGRAM AND WE APPLAUD SENATOR FOR HIS HARD WORK ON IT. BUT HE IS CERTAINLY CORRECT THAT JUDGES RETIREMENT SYSTEM IS A REALLY UNIQUE. PROGRAM WITHIN -- THE STATE SYSTEM IT IS THE ONLY HYBRID PROGRAM THAT I KNOW OF ANYWHERE IN PUBLIC SERVICE WHERE YOU HAVE A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION UNTIL THE EXACT MOMENT OF VESTING. AT WHICH CASE YOU CONTRIBUTE YOU CHANGE TO A DEFINED BENEFIT. IT ALSO IS THE ONLY SYSTEM I KNOW OF THAT HAS THIS SORT OF CLIFF VESTING. A THAT SORT OF CLIFF VESTING IS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL IN PRIVATE PLANS SO THIS IMPROVEMENT IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S WORTHY -- THERE HAS BEEN QUESTION AND AND SO THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION HAS A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS ABOUT COST ESTIMATES ABOUT THE PLAN OVERTIME AND THEY HAVE. VARIED WILDLY. A AT THE PRESENT TIME -- WE BELIEVE -- THE ACTUARIAL COST IS THESE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND TO A MILLION PER YEAR -- THE SPONSORS HAVE INDICATED THAT NO -- POSED PEPPERIDGE JUDGE SHOULD HAVE THEIR RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION INCREASED BECAUSE OF THE ENACTMENT OF THIS BILL. THE OTHER UNIQUE THING ABOUT JUDGES PENSION LAW UNDER PEPPER. IS THIS ONE HALF OF NORMAL COST OBLIGATION ON NEW PEPPERIDGE JUDGES. HAS THE HIGHEST EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTION I'M AWARE OF IN THE STATE SYSTEM IT IS PRESENTLY SIXTEEN POINT 75% OF SALARY WHICH IS FAR HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER EMPLOYEES THAT I KNOW OF SO WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT THE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED JUDGES WHO COULD SEE THAT SIXTEEN POINT 75% GO UP. AND WE HAVE ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION THAT THEIR CONTRIBUTION WOULD NOT BE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE WHICH WOULD [inaudible] IMPLEMENT THE A STATEMENT MADE BY THE SPONSORS THAT NO POST PEPPER JUDGE WOULD PAY MORE FOR THIS BENEFIT. IF THAT AMENDMENT IS INCLUDED WE'D BE DELIGHTED TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. NO SPEAKERS AND SUPPORT SPEAKERS OPPOSITION. LOCAL PUBLIC COMMENT FIRST OLYMPIC CENTER FOR BEING THIS BILL FORWARD PAID SO MUCH NEED TO FIX THAT MAYES JUST A SECOND A COUNTY. THE OPTION TO WORK WITH AND DEATHLY UNDERSTAND THEIR PLIGHT. AND THEIR ISSUES. INCOME IS THE COMMITTEE MISTER BROKE. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER -- CENTER MORLOCK THANKS FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS THIS HAD BEEN TRIED BEFORE AND THE THE PICK UP WAS ALWAYS SENATE PERSONA THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN YOUR HARD WORK WITH SARAH LAUREN GETTING INTO SENATE PURSE -- ALSO LIKE SAY HELLO TO MY FRIEND AND FORMER DANA POINT RESIDENT JUDGE JOHN ADAMS FOR HIS HARD WORK THIS IS BEEN SEVERAL YEARS IN THE MAKING AND THANKS FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS AND I'M PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL. IT KNOW FOR THE COMMENTS THAT WE INCLUDE CLOSING COMMENTS THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- THANK YOU ASSUMING BROKE FOR BEING ENCOURAGE YOUR FROM THE GET GO -- WHEN THIS STARTED LAST YEAR? I REALLY APPRECIATE IT -- COLLEAGUES I I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE REQUEST FOR AN AMENDMENT -- WHEN YOU HAVE TWO HUNDRED JUDGES THAT R. J. ARRESTS ONE AND THEN YOU HAVE? ROUGHLY THIRTEEN HUNDRED BETTER CHERISH TO IN ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED BETTER POST PEPPER THAT ARE NEW -- WHEN THE ACTUARIES I DO THE? CALCULATION OF THE CONTRIBUTION -- I CERTAINLY EMPATHIZE WITH THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT THE POST PEPPER JUDGES -- WE WORK WITH CALPERS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AFTER THIS ISSUE WAS. BROUGHT TO US AND THEY'RE A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO MAKE ANY RECOMMENDED CHANGES. IN THAT THE BILL AS IT IS A IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO TELL ACTUARY HOW TO MAKE SOME CALCULATIONS -- SO THAT'S WHY I'M [inaudible] SORT OF NOT GOING THE AMENDMENT ROUTE I'M KIND OF SAYING THIS IS LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IT WAS A LOT BIGGER WHEN WE STARTED WE HAD A LIABILITY THAT WAS OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ACTUARIES AT CALPERS AN EXTERNAL. AND SO I I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNOR I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THIS COST WE'VE JUST GIVEN SOME GET FUNDING TO THE TO THE JUDICIARY BRANCH IN THIS CURRENT BUDGET THAT WAS APPROVED LAST WEEK. AND WE'RE ALSO DOING A WHOLE LOT FOR THE MENTALLY ILL AND THE HOMELESS I I WOULD THINK THAT -- WE SHOULD BE REFLECTIVE OF WHO'S REALLY WORKING HARD MAKING OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM WORK AND FOR FOR THIS SMALL AND A MODIFICATION WE'RE GIVING A BIG INCENTIVE. TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T PAY THEM YOU DISCOURAGE THEM THEY DON'T FEEL APPRECIATED IN THIS IS A A GLORIOUS OPPORTUNITY I JUST THINK WE SHOULD. TAKE CARE OF IT ALL ONCE AND FOR ALL IN THE BUDGET AND MAKE A STRONG STATEMENT OF SUPPORT PROJECTED SO THANK YOU. AND I ASK REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. LOCAL POLICE.

UP OFTEN THEM WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR SPOUSE. THEN THOSE REDUCTIONS ARE REDUCE OR IN FACT OFTEN ELIMINATED AS WELL THIS HAS A MASSIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON RETIREES AND AS YOU KNOW WOMEN HAVE OFTEN NOT HAD. EQUAL REPRESENTATION WHEN IT COMES TO EQUALITY IN RETIREMENT AND SO WE SEE THE ELIMINATION OF THOSE SOCIAL SECURITY OFF SAID SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE.

NOTHING HELD [inaudible] ON SHE BUT I MENTION NICOLAS OPENS A CRACK [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] TO TRY. I HEARD SUPPORT. WHERE CURLY WAITING FOR US SENATOR [inaudible] SKINNER. SHOP SAWS WE WAIT. SHOULD TAKE OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR SECRETARY UNKNOWN OR WE'RE DEGENERATE OKAY WE'RE GOOD [inaudible] TROPICAL OVER [inaudible] YEAH. WE'RE JUST GONNA DO EVERY WE ONLY NEED FOR IN THE BILL IS. GOVERNOR'S NUMBER. SEVEN THIS LAST ONE YEAH. SENATOR THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE OUR LAST RULED THAT THE DAY -- FOUGHT NUMBER SEVEN S. B. TEN EIGHTY FIVE SENATOR. THE MIKE IS YOURS THANK YOU I'M CHAIRED VERY PREACHED TO OF OF IN COLLEGES FOR THE COMMITTEE. THE DELAY -- MY MAYOR OF ONE OF MY MY LARGEST CITY IS PRESENTING ON A BILL IN THE COMMITTEE I WAS SITTING AND SO. ANYWAY. I'M SP TEN EIGHTY FIVE RECOGNIZES THAT. WE HAVE -- PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WHO ALSO HAVE RULES IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS THAT THEY ARE MEMBERS OF SO OFTEN THEY ARE THE STEWARDS FOR THAT UNION OR ANOTHER RULE. AND THAT IT REQUIRES THEM AT TIMES TO TAKE OFF TIME FROM THEIR REGULAR JOBS TO PERFORM THEIR UNION DUTIES AND SO WHAT S. B. TEN EIGHTY FIVE DOES IS ENSURE THAT. THOSE EMPLOYEES CAN RECEIVE A LEAVE OF ABSENCE WHICH THE UNION PAYS FOR COVERS ALL COSTS. AND THEN THAT THE REINSTATEMENT WOULD OCCUR WHEN THEY'RE COMPLETE THEIR DUTIES WITHOUT LOSS OF SENIORITY. AND I IT ALSO HOLDS THE AND EMPLOYER HARMLESS SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT OCCURS WHILE THE EMPLOYEES DURING THEIR UNION DUTIES. THE EMPLOYERS NOT HELD LIABLE THEIR HELD HARMLESS. AND US OF THE STUDENT ADDRESSES WHAT SOME. EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO GRANT THOSE -- EMPLOYEES THEIR ABILITY TO DO THEIR UNION DUTY SO WITH THAT I ASPIRO VOTING MY WITNESS MICHELE KESTLER FROM SEIU GOOD SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MICHELLE CAST THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL BE VERY BRIEF. JUST WANT TO SAY A FEW THINGS CURRENT LAW. CURRENTLY ALLOWS EMPLOYEES THE RIGHT TO FORM JOIN AND PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THEIR EMPLOYEES ORGANIZATION. BUT THAT RIGHT IS THWARTED ONE PUBLIC EMPLOYERS REFUSED TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE TIME OFF -- AS SENATOR SKINNER SAID THIS BILL REALLY IS BUILT OFF OF THE A LAW THAT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE PROVIDES US RIGHT TO SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND ALL IT DOES IS PROVIDE THE SAME RIGHTS TO OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES -- LAST POINT IS THE OPPOSITION IS GOING TO COME UP HERE AND CONTEND THAT THIS BILL TAKES AWAY IMPORTANT MEASURES FROM THE BARGAINING PROCESS. TO THE DETRIMENT OF PUBLIC AGENCIES AND COMMUNITIES. TWO POINTS ON THAT FIRST THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO THESE TYPES OF LEAVES AND NOBODY HAS BEEN HARMED COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT BEEN HARMED SERVICES HAVE NOT BEEN HARMED HARMED -- THEY REALLY ONLY HAVE ISSUE WITH ONE MATTER COMING OUT OF THE BARGAINING PROCESS AND THAT'S THEIR VETO AUTHORITY. THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH TWO OTHER ISSUES COMING OUT OF THE BARGAINING PROCESS AND THAT IS WHAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE TO ASK FOR A US IN THE BARGAINING PROCESS AND THAT'S TO FULLY REIMBURSED FOR THE COST OF EMPLOYEES TIME WHILE THEY'RE ON LEAVE. AND TO INDEMNIFY THEM WE PROVIDED BOTH OF THOSE THINGS IN THIS BILL -- AGAIN ALL THIS BILL DOES IS GIVE THESE EMPLOYMENT EMPLOYEES EQUAL TREATMENT TO OTHER EMPLOYEES WE ASK FREE AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THINK ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. MARK CHAIR MEMBERS RANGE FROM WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION I'M OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN I GREATLY IMPACTED -- ON THIS ISSUE. WE'VE BEEN A FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THE TIME OFF TO TAKE CARE OF OUR UNION DUTIES. FOR OUR MEMBERS AND TIME UNTIL RECENTLY JUST ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO BOMB OUR SHERIFF DECIDED THAT HE WANTED TO NOT DO THAT ANYMORE AND JUST HAD ELIMINATED. AND THIS IS BECAUSE OUR EMPLOYEES TO NOW HAVE TO BURN THEIR OWN TIME. TO DO THEIR UNION DAVIES EVEN THOUGH THE UNION HAS ALWAYS PAID. FOR THOSE SAME ACTIVITIES AND THERE'S NEVER ANY COST THIS WAS A RESULT OF SOME POLITICAL DIFFERENCES THAT ARE ASSOCIATION AND OUR SHERIFF OF HAD. AND TARA WERE BEING A WE'RE BEING HARMED AS A RESULT AND SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL LAST YEAR I VOTE. MIKE WE'LL WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ARE ALSO HERE STRONG SUPPORT. TO CHECK MEMBERS PATRON WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATE REPEALING THE PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN THE ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. CHRISTIE BELL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS IN SUPPORT. DILLER STRAND FLORIST ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY'S GOING PLACES CESSATION IN SUPPORT. JOSH WILL GO GO WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES IN SUPPORT. RIGHT NOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE OPPOSITION. GET READY MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AGAIN DOROTHY JOHNSON THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND ALSO BEHALF MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE URBAN COUNTIES THE CALIFORNIA THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTS OF CALIFORNIA WHO WERE ALSO ALL STUCK IN OTHER COMMITTEE HEARINGS THIS MORNING. AND WE ARE HERE RESPECTFULLY POSE TO THE MEASURE -- AND I DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE OFFERED AND THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS BUT UNFORTUNATELY -- WE FEEL THIS BILL TIPS THE SCALE FAR WITH THE MANDATORY -- LEAVE THAT MUST BE PROVIDED -- OUR LOCAL AGENCIES UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR ENGAGEMENT AND INVOLVEMENT -- WITH THEIR REPRESENTATIVES BUT AGAIN -- THIS CREATING NEW TYPE OF PROTECTIVE LEAVE BUT WE THINK -- IS AB AT STEP. TO STEP TWO PARTS USE ME. AM I ALSO IMAGINE THIS IS NOT CODIFYING EXISTING PRACTICES THAT MAY BE THE CASE AND MANY LOCAL AGENCIES BUT IT IS NOT A STATE RIGHT PRACTICE. AND IT DOES NOT ACTUALLY NEAR WHAT SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO DO SCHOOLS HAVE A MANDATORY REIMBURSEMENT FULL REIMBURSEMENT AND WITHIN TEN DAYS -- OF THAT LEAVES SO IT'S NOT EXACTLY MARRIED WHAT THE SCHOOLS DO HAVE -- ARE COUNTIES ARE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED FOR POSITIONS IN HUMAN SERVICES IN CHILDREN'S SERVICES DEPARTMENTS THERE FUND OF ITS STATE AND FEDERAL DOLLARS -- UNFORTUNATELY FOR NOT ABLE TO GET FULL REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE POSITIONS THAT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE STATE OR FEDERAL DOLLARS INSTEAD THAT WOULD COME OUT OF OUR GENERAL FUND SO THAT'S ANOTHER TRUCK COST. COUNTIES AND OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES ARE ALSO ON THE HOOK FOR PROVIDING ACCRUED SICK LEAVE AND VACATION TIME IS ALSO PENSION CREDIT THAT WOULD STILL CREW WHILE THE INDIVIDUAL WAS OUT FOR UNION PURPOSES. AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE HEARD CONCERNS FROM OUR COUNTIES ABOUT WHEN THAT COLLATERAL COLLATERAL WORKERS BROUGHT IN TO BACK FILL THE POSITION WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM AND HOW ARE THERE. I'M RIGHTS AND ABILITIES PRESERVED ON IF THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR POSITION AFTER A MONTH SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR SO. FOR THE REASONS STATED WE RESPECTFULLY POSES MEASURE THINK ILL. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE -- COMMENTS WIENER. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER OR WHAT THEY CONSIDER BRING US FOR THIS IS A OF MUCH NEEDED BILL I'VE SEEN INACTION SACRAMENTO COUNTY. WHICH IS WHERE LARGER COUNTIES IN SACRAMENTO HAVE BEEN ON BOTH ENDS OF IT AS A BARGAINING UNIT MEMBER BUT ALSO THE MANAGER PARTY A CONTRACT. IT'S EFFECTIVE SILVER SO TO SAY THAT DOESN'T WORK NO BY THAT. IT'S A LOT EASIER TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES ON THE FRONT END AND GET SOME RELEASED UNDERGONE BARGAINING CONTRACT. THEY GET WORK BETTER FOR EVERYBODY SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. AS WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORWARD [inaudible] AND ALLAH.
