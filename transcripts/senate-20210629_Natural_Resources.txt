PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LET ME START BY ACCEPTING THE CHAIR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND I WANT TO THANK KATHIR MORE. FOR ALL HER HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. WE KNOW CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE A SEVERE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS WITH THE DEFICIENCY OF THREE MILLION HOMES AND GROWING. THE ISSUE WAS EXACERBATED IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF THE COASTAL ZONE WHERE DEVELOPMENTS FACE VARIOUS CHALLENGES. EIGHTY USES SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. CAN PROVIDE SOLUTIONS TO HELP THE CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS FOR MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS YET. UNDER UTILIZED IN THE COASTAL ZONE IN PART DUE TO THE TIME INTENSIVE NATURE OF THE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT PROCESS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN RECENT YEARS. PASS LAWS TO STREAMLINE THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES FOR EIGHTY YEARS SUPPORT OF A HOUSING AND- AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HOWEVER WHILE THOSE HELP CITIES AND COUNTIES THEY DID NOT EXTEND TO CDP'S WHICH ARE AS YOU KNOW ESTATE PROCESS. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT. THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION HAS TAKEN STEPS TO CLARIFY THE REGULATORY PROCESS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ADOPT. HOWEVER IT IS NOT EXPRESSLY WITHIN THE COMMISSION SCOPE. TO PROMOTE SOLUTIONS. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE. WITH OPPOSITION FROM THE COMMISSION THE LEGISLATURE AMENDED THE COASTAL ACT AND REMOVED LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING POLICIES FOR MISTER STICTION. AB FIVE HUNDRED WOULD REINSTATE THE COASTAL ACT AFFORDABLE HOUSING POLICIES. THAT WERE REPEALED FORTY YEARS AGO TO GIVE THE COMMISSION THE AUTHORITY. TO PROTECT EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND ENSURE THAT NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS CONSISTENT WITH COASTAL ACT POLICIES. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO UPDATE AND STREAMLINE. THE REGULATORY CDP PROCESS FOR EIGHTY YEARS JUNIOR EIGHTY YEARS. SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND THE COASTAL ZONE. AND I'M WORKING WITH THE COMMISSION TO MAKE SURE THAT PROCESS IS EXPEDITIOUS AND SIMPLE. THE BILL RETAIN SUPPORT FOR EVALUATION PROTECTIONS OF SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO RESOURCES. IN THE COASTAL ZONE WHILE REMOVING BARRIERS FOR THESE HOUSING TYPES. BY APPROVING AB FIVE HUNDRED. COASTAL COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH POSTAL COMMISSION AND PROVIDE NEW HOUSING SOLUTIONS. AND TO ENSURE THAT NOT JUST VISITORS SERVING. ACCOMMODATIONS BUT ALSO RESIDENTS SO. TO THE- IS BETTER FOR YOU TO ALL. I'D LIKE TO PRESENT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THIS BILL WE HAVE ZERO CHRISTIE THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FROM THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION. AND BILL PRINCE LOOKING THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PEOPLE ORGANIZED FOR WESTSIDE RENEWAL. VERY GOOD THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. LET'S TURN TO OUR FIRST WITNESS- AGAIN EACH SIDE WE PERMITTED THREE MINUTES TOTAL FOR THE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES AND THEN- GENERAL ME TO USE FOR THE- FIFTEEN MINUTES ELSEWHERE FOR SIDE SO- MODERATOR WOULD YOU- PLEASE CALL THE FIRST WITNESS. SO I JUST GO. ONE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING CARE NUMBERS I'M SURE CHRISTY WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION WHICH IS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO SUPPORT SB FIVE HUNDRED. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE WELL AWARE OF COMPLEX MANDATES TO PROTECT CULTURAL RESOURCES LIKE SENSITIVE HABITATS WETLANDS AND PUBLIC ACCESS. BUT YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT WHEN THE COAST LACK WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX IT ALSO INCLUDED A POLICY TO PROTECT AND PROVIDE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHICH WAS CONSIDERED AT THE TIME A COASTAL RESOURCE. FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE PROGRAM THE COMMISSION WITH AUTHOR THE COMMISSION AUTHORIZED THE CONSTRUCTION OF OVER FIVE THOUSAND EACH RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS TO BE BUILT WITHIN THE MANY COLORFUL SUBDIVISIONS SPRINGING UP FROM SAN DIEGO TO SANTA CRUZ. THE COMMISSION ALSO PREVENTED THE DEMOLITION OF OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED EXISTING UNITS AND COLLECTED OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN INCLUDE FEET. BUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS AS CONTROVERSIAL BAN AS IT IS NOW SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE SENATOR HENRY MELLO CARRIED A BILL THAT REPEALED THE COMMISSION AFFORDABLE HOUSING AUTHORITY. AND EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DEMOLISH EXISTING AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THE FOCUS ON. IT PROHIBITED THE COMMISSION FROM REQUIRING HOUSING PROGRAMS AND HEALTHY PEAS. BUT AUTHORIZED DEVELOPERS TO GET OUT FROM UNDER EARLIER CONDITIONS REQUIRING THEM TO BUILD AFFORDABLE UNITS. AS A RESULT ONLY THIRTEEN HUNDRED OF THE FIVE THOUSAND UNITS WERE EVER BUILT. IMAGINE WHAT CALIFORNIA WOULD LOOK LIKE TODAY IF THE COMMISSION HAD BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE PROTECTING AND PROMOTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CALL HOLD ON. FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED WOULD RESTORE THE COMPLEX AFFORDABLE HOUSING POLICIES. AND REPEAL THE PROHIBITION ON HOUSING POLICIES IN L. C. P. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO PROVIDE FOR GREATER RESIDENTIAL DENSITY IN URBAN AREAS NOT AT RISK OF WILDFIRE PERSONALIZED. FINALLY IT WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO UPDATE THEIR L. C. P. TO REFLECT RECENT CHANGES TO EIGHTY YOU LAWS. SOMETHING THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN RECOMMENDING SINCE TWO TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN A SERIES OF GUIDANCE MEMOS. MEMBERS THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDO THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST AND RESTORE THE COSTA LACKS ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE COASTLINE THAT IS NOT THE ONLY ACCESSIBLE. TO ALL BUT LIVABLE AS WELL I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'M AVAILABLE TO QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISS CHRISTY- NEXT LEAD SPORT WITNESS. PLEASE PROCEED.

POWER NOR MEMBERS ALSO SUPPORT AB FIVE HUNDRED WE WERE FOUND IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND ONE SIDE LA TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT THAT GENTRIFICATION WHICH HAVE AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WITHIN OUR COASTAL ZONE. AND WE OUGHT TO CREATE AND PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE GRASSROOTS MEMBERS REGULARLY ENGAGE WITH LOCAL PLANNING DEPARTMENTS CITY PLANNING COMMISSION DOWN THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND ITS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TO EXPLAIN NORM GRASSROOTS MEMBERS THAT THE COASTAL COMMISSION CANNOT CONSIDER PORTABLE HOUSING THE PRIMARY REASON OUR MEMBERS ENGAGED IN LAND USE CONVERTIBLE HOUSING IS IN FACT BECAUSE THE RESOURCE AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH BY THE COMMISSION AND- UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE RESTRICTED BY LAW AND CAN'T DO THAT. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU RECALL THAT YOU SUPPORT AS WELL SO THAT OUR MEMBERS CAN ENGAGE THE COMMISSION ON ASIA THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM ACROSS LAND USE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

WELL WE AGREE WITH THE STATED GOAL OF AB FIVE HUNDRED WHICH IS TO PROVIDE MORE HOUSING WE DON'T BELIEVE AB FIVE HUNDRED DOES THAT. AS YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE PREVIOUSLY REMOVED THE CULTURE COMMISSION POWER TO IMPOSE HOUSING POLICY BECAUSE OF THE INCONSISTENCY THEY THOUGHT BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE COASTAL COMMISSION WE BELIEVE IT'S THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS JOB I TO APPROVE HOUSING. AND WHAT WE HAVE OFFERED OUR SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WE BELIEVE DO THIS. FIVE BUT UNFORTUNATELY- WE INCORRECTLY- UNDERSTOOD THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS- WERE ACCEPTABLE THE AUTHOR DOES THE MEMBERS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE YET WE HAVE SUBMITTED THOSE AMENDMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE. INCLUDING WANT TO SAVE YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HOUSING PRODUCTION BEEN MAKE IT VERY CLEAR WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN AND CANNOT DO WE BELIEVE THIS BILL OPENS UP SO MUCH MORE ON SUBJECTIVE. APPROVAL OR NON APPROVAL WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE HOUSING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CONVINCE US THAT THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S PRIMARY GOAL IS TO PROMOTE HOUSING- BE MORE SPECIFIC WITH THIS BILL AND ACCEPT OUR AMENDMENTS.

HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT RATHER PROMOTE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COASTAL ZONE. AB FIVE HUNDRED WOULD ACTUALLY SHIP THE AUTHORITY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMPRISED OF ELECTED OFFICIALS YOUR CLOSEST RESIDENT CAN YOU NEEDS. TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION ON ELECTED STATEWIDE BODY WITH SCARCE RESOURCES AND LIMITED EXPERIENCE ADMINISTERING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISSUES. IN DOING SO AB. FIVE HUNDRED. IN FAVOR OF THE COSTA COMMISSION. MOREOVER EIGHTY FIVE I WILL GRANT THE COASTAL COMMISSION WITH UNBRIDLED DISCRETION TO DEVELOP HOUSING POLICY WITHOUT ANY OTHER RESTRICTIONS OR SAFEGUARDS CONTAINED IN THE MAIL ACT IS BLANK CHECK RAISE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S POTENTIAL POLICY RESPONSE. PARTICULARLY LIE THE COMMISSION'S GUIDELINES BONTA PORTABLE HOUSING PRIOR TO NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WHICH CONTEMPLATE YOU POTENTIALLY ONEROUS INCLUSIONARY HOUSING REQUIREMENTS DEVELOPED OUTSIDE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. RENDON SUCH BY HOUSING AT WITHOUT LIMITING TO THE COMMISSION BUT CREATE SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPERS AS NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS COULD BE ADDED ON AN AD HOC BASIS LATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR YOU KNOW. IT IT IS MEMBERS SUPPORT MORE NOT LET HOW MUCH HOW THE INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA- OUT ALL WRAPPED UP CHAIRMAN.

GOOD MORNING CARLA FARLEY ON BEHALF OF MARCOS CALIFORNIA'S BEGIN STRONG OPPOSITION OF AB FIVE HUNDRED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MANY OTHERS. MR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. OKAY WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE DIS- COMMENTS WILL START CENTER HUESO AND WILL BRING IT AROUND OR- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD- YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IF YOU ASK ANYBODY IN OUR STATE EVERYBODY. WANTS US TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HOMELESSNESS THEY BELIEVE THEY SHOULD HOMELESSNESS SHOULD NOT EXIST BUT WHENEVER YOU PROPOSE PUTTING HOMELESS FACILITY IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. ABSOLUTELY NOT I THINK ALSO OF CALIFORNIANS ONE OF MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT WHEN YOU PROPOSE PUTTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEIGHBORHOOD NEIGHBORHOODS ABSOLUTELY NOT IN MY BACKYARD TYPE OF IT FEELING. AND THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE HERE IN GOVERNMENT THAT WHENEVER WE TRY TO PROPOSE ANY SOLUTION TO BRING. ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO THE STATE THERE'S ALWAYS A GROUP THE COMES OUT AND SAYS ABSOLUTELY NOT WE CAN'T DO THAT I JUST HAVEN'T FOUND A SOLUTION. THAT MAKES EVERYONE HAPPY. BUT WE HAVE ONE HERE THAT IS COMPLETELY REASONABLE ONE THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT USED TO ALREADY BE PART OF THE PROCESS THE FACT THAT IT WAS REMOVED. IT IS JUST A SAD PIECE OF HISTORY IN OUR STATE THAT WE CANNOT THAT THE COASTAL COMMISSION SHOULD NOT. INFORCE PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COASTERS ON WHAT HAS HAPPENED. OUR COASTAL AREAS HAVE BECOME LESS AFFORDABLE. AND IN MANY CASES SOME SOME OF THE SOME OF THE JOBS BE PROVIDED IN THE COASTAL AREA HAVE ALSO BEEN LESS WELL REMUNERATED SO. FOUR FOUR COULD COMMUNITIES ON THE COASTLINE THEY DEFINITELY PROVIDE A LOT OF LOW WAGE JOBS. BUT EVERY SINGLE WORKER THAT COMES INTO THE COASTAL ZONE COMES FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT GOOD FOR OUR FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S DEFINITELY. NOT GOOD TO CREATE AN EQUITABLE SOCIETY AND DEFINITELY NOT GOOD TO. PROVIDE PEOPLE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE WHEREVER THEY WANT TO LIVE IN THE STATE. THAT'S JUST AN ENORMOUS FAILURE OF OUR STATE GOVERNMENT IT'S UP ENORMOUS FAITH- FAILURE OF HOW OF PUBLIC POLICY HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED REALLY TO SEGREGATE PEOPLE IN OUR STATE IN TWO DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS WE HAVE. HIGH INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN MIDDLE INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN CALIFORNIA JUST AN ENORMOUSLY SEGREGATED STATE AND IT AND IT'S BEEN IT'S VERY SAD AND WE SHOULD AS POLICY MAKERS WORK. TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO LIVE WHEREVER THEY WANT AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IT ONE ATTEND AND GIVE THEM. THE OPPORTUNITY. TO LIVE WHERE THEY WORK AND TOO POTENTIALLY WALK TO WORK OR NOT HAVE THESE ENORMOUSLY LONG COMMUTES- SO. I APPRECIATE THIS BILL I YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED THAT THIS IS GONNA. A CREATE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE COASTAL COMMISSION YES. THERE ARE INCONSISTENCIES BECAUSE IN MANY CASES THERE ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE NOT IMPLEMENTING THE COAST LACKED. THEY REFUSE TO CREATE A LOCAL COASTAL PLAN OFTENTIMES WHEN THERE'S A LAW ON THE BOOKS THEY APPROVED PROJECTS TO DO NOT CONFORM THAT'S JUST. A FACT. AND YES THAT CREATES A CONFLICT BECAUSE SOMETIMES WITH THE COASTAL ACT. REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS JUST DO NOT WANT TO DO. AND IF YOU ASK ME AND YOU KNOW I HAVE SEEN VERY VERY LITTLE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO BE BUILT IN THE COASTAL. COASTAL ZONE. I HAVE WORKED. AND SUCCESSFULLY TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COASTAL ZONE BUT IT WASN'T COMMUNITIES LIKE MARTY LOGAN. THAT JOB I HAVE OFTEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BUT INDUSTRIAL USES AN AND PARTY LOGAN WE HAVE TRIED TO. REZONE AND CREATE A COMMUNITY THAT YOU SEE AN AREA THAT USED TO BE A COMMUNITY BUT THAT WAS ABSORBED BY INDUSTRIAL USE IN AND BEFORE YOU KNOW WE HAD JUNKYARDS AND WE HAD. OF CHROME PLATING SHOPS AND WE HAD- USES ADJUSTED NOT MIX WITH RESIDENTIAL AND I THINK THAT'S A CALIFORNIA STORE IF YOU GO AROUND CALIFORNIA YOU SEE WHERE. IF THEIR OWN ANY LOW INCOME PEOPLE LIVE IN THE CLOSE IT'S USUALLY IN VERY CONTAMINATED COMMUNITIES IN THE COAST A BUDDY IN INDUSTRY. AND THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE CAN RESOLVE THIS BILL COULD RESULT THAT HOPE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS I I'M ENCOURAGED. THAT THIS BILL COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE I SERVED ON THE COAST COMMISSION. I WAS THERE SEVERAL YEARS AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES. IT WAS SIDE DURING A HERE. THAT WE COULD NOT EVEN DISCUSS AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN STRICKEN. FROM THE COASTAL ACT. AND HOW MUCH OF A. FIVE A JUST A HISTORIC. JUDICIARY OF DATA THERE IS ON THE SUBJECT THAT'S THERE IT'S AVAILABLE TO US NOW IF THIS WAS REINSTATED WE CAN GO BACK TO YEARS AND YEARS OF CASE LAW RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE IN THE COASTAL ZONE. THAT WOULD HELP US TO JUDICATA FUTURE HOUSING SO THIS IS NOT ANYTHING NEW. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS A TOOL. PROBABLY DIDN'T SOLVE ALL THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS BUT IT SOLVES SOME. AND THIS BILL WILL PROBABLY NOT SOLVE ALL THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS BECAUSE YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE RESISTANCE TO ANY KIND OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THE IN THE IN THE COASTAL ZONE OR ANY HOUSING WHETHER FORD WILL NOT THAT HOUSES WORKERS MIDDLE INCOME WORKERS OR EVEN. A LOW LOW WAGE WORKERS ANYTHING THAT RESEMBLES THAT WILL BE OPPOSED TO THE CULTURES ON NO MATTER WHAT LAW IS PUT INTO PLACE BUT HAVING THAT I THINK WILL MAKE. AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE IN THEM THAT THAT WILL DISCUSSION WILL BE HAD AND IT WILL HOLD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE TO APPROVING PROJECTS THAT KNOWN NOT ONLY CONFORM TO THE STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS BUT THEN IT ALLOWS ANOTHER JURISDICTION THAT HAS A LOT OF INFLUENCE TO ENSURE. THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE WORKING THANKS PRODIGIOUSLY TO CREATE THE HOUSING THAT THEY PROMISED TO PROVIDE SO I THINK THIS IS ONE MORE FULL BILL I DON'T THINK IT NEEDS ANYTHING I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR IF THAT'S POSSIBLE AT SOME POINT IN THIS PROCESS AND I JUST WANT TO PLOT- THE AUTHOR FOR HAVING THE COURAGE REALLY TO BRING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS. THAT WILL FULFILL ITS PROMISE THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU CENTER HUESO CENTER EGGMAN- CENTER LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THAT IT ACTUALLY MISTER HUESO PARK ANSWERED THE QUESTION I WAS GOING TO ASK THE AUTHOR BUT OUR BECAUSE- I'VE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES ARE THE NEXT OFFICIAL MEMBER OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION FOR EIGHT YEARS BUT I WAS ALSO MARRIED TO TIME WE ADOPTED A LOCAL COASTAL PLAN AND- AT THE SAME TIME AS RESOURCES SECRETARY FUNDED THE UPDATE OF COUNTLESS LOCAL COASTAL PLANTS PRIMARILY. TO DEAL WITH SEA LEVEL RISE. AND SO WHEN I READ THE ANALYSIS AND READ THE LETTERS THAT CAME IN. TO GET THE GOAL ARE OBVIOUSLY SHARE THE GOAL I UNDERSTAND THE BILL AND WHAT IT DOES BUT WHAT'S NOT CLEARLY ARTICULATED. THAT SENATOR HUESO GOD AT A BIT IN HIS COMMENTS IS HOW DOES THIS ACTUALLY PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND HOW DOES THIS NOT IMPEDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WAS NOT CLEAR FROM THE ANALYSIS AND SO HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT. THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED AND- I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT THAT PERSON DOESN'T ALTER SPONSORED BILL I WANTED TO GET IN THERE AND BE IN CONTROL OF HOW WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING INTO THE SPACE SIDEBAND WRITTEN EVERY WORD I'VE ANALYZED EVERY COMMA BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THIS IS DONE RIGHT- WE HAVE. EXAMPLES FROM THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WHICH I PREVIOUSLY SERVED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL WE ACTUALLY EAT MORE ABOUT MORE THAN A YEAR AHEAD OF THE STATE WHEN WE STREAMLINED OUR EIGHTY YOU REGULATIONS AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS. IN THE PARTS OF THE CITY OUTSIDE OF THE COASTAL ZONE WILDLY POPULAR PEOPLE WANTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT THEY WERE ON THE NEW THAT HAVE REDUCED PERMIT TIME TO NEW THAT WOULD HAVE REDUCED COSTS- AND THEY WERE IN WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THE WERE WE OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD. THOSE PERMITS COMING INTO THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO THE PART OF THE CITY THAT IS INSIDE THE COASTAL ZONE WE HAD SIX DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD AND WE TALK TO THOSE AND DEVELOP INDIVIDUALS AND WE TALKED THE OTHER. INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO THINK ABOUT 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT INSIDE THE COASTAL ZONE. KC YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL BARRIER AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU BUT THE ADDITIONAL PART OF THE PROCESS TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH A CD P. REVIEW. THEY KNOW THAT TAKES TIME THEY KNOW THAT THE STAFF FOR THE COLUMBUS ALREADY. AYE SIR JERRY BROWN USE AN ACRONYM GO. TO PRISON. WHAT DOES HE ACT. MEAN THAT YOU'RE SAID. THE- THE EIGHTY. OF CDP OR SOMETHING THAT. PER BECAUSE THAT THANK YOU ALL PART THAT WE TO GO. AND I. THE CLOSER TO. DESERVE MORE RE. BECAUSE THEY BACK LAW WITHIN OF STAFF TODAY. BUT THESE ARE VERY SIMPLE. TYPES THAT WE KNOW HELP CONTRIBUTE. TO THE HOUSING STOCK THAT WE NEED FOR MIDDLE AND LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS THEY OUGHT TO BE EXPEDITED. AT THE TOP OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION THEY SAY. REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE. VOTER AND ENTITLED MANDATES TO REALLY PROTECT OUR COASTAL RESOURCES PROTECT COASTAL ACCESS BUT FOR ME WHEN I'M HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THEM. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT VISITORS SERVING ACCOMMODATIONS AS A LAND USE BODY. THAT ALREADY HAS REGULATORY POWERS IT'S IMPORTANT THEY'RE BALANCING RESIDENTIAL INTEREST THERE- FOR HOW WE ARE MAKING SURE. THAT THE POSTAL ON DEVELOPMENT PLANS WHICH EVERY CITY OR EVERY JURISDICTION SHOULD BE SUBMITTING AS WELL. ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE UNDERLYING CITY ZONING SITTING. HOUSING ELEMENTS SO. I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL ON TIME I CHECK AND BALANCE THAT WE HAVE FOR SPECIAL ZONE OF OUR STATE. HE AND I'M NOT SURE THAT TOTALLY. ADDRESSES IT WILL BE TRIED A DIFFERENT WAY. BECAUSE IN MY HOME AREA IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T GET WHAT THEY WANT. THEY USED A LOCAL COASTAL PLAN TO APPEAL IT TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND DRAG OUT THE DEVELOPMENT. AND THAT'S NOT IN THIS FOR EIGHTY USER OTHER THINGS NOW. BUT IT WILL HAVE THIS. HOW ARE YOU CONFIDENT. THAT THIS WILL EXPEDITE AND NOT ALLOW PEOPLE ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE TO DELAY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OKAY THAT'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND CLICK USE AS A SENATOR SO IT MAY NOT BE IN THE ANALYSIS BUT IT IS IN THE BILL. IN ON PAGE SEVEN THAT ACTUALLY DOES DIRECT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO UPDATE THEIR- THEIR STREAMLINED PERMITTING PROCEDURES FOR EIGHTY YEARS JUNIOR EIGHTY YEARS A 100% AFFORDABLE UNITS. AND SUPPORT OF HOUSING UNITS AS WELL. SO SHALL. BE PROCESSED BY THE COMMISSION AND DOT WITH RESPECT TO ONE OF THE ARE. TESTIMONY I HAPPEN WORKING WITH FOR SOME- MONTHS. THERE IS ACTUALLY L. DIAZ FOR TWO THINGS ONE OF THOSE IS HERE IN THE BILL WHICH REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO PROCESS AND APPROVING THEM IT WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT SPECIFIED. IN CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE OF THE CODE ON SO THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A GUARANTEE AND THIS CASE IS A LINES WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S ASSESSING PROCESS TO PROCESS- THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I THINK THAT THERE'S ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE BUT YOUR BILL IS LIMITING HOW THE BITE AT THE APPLE CAN BE TAKEN SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I'M NOT SURE I STREAMLINING OR LIMITING THE NUMBER OF TIME I'M TRYING TO GET. AT WHAT. I DO KNOW BE WE'VE DONE A LOT IN THIS LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO. PROMOTE A STREAMLINING OF CERTAIN HOUSING NO NO I KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT AND THAT EXISTS IN LAW. RIGHT AND YOU ARE ADDING ANOTHER PIECE OF THE LAW THAT EXISTS IN LAW FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IT DOESN'T EXIST FOR THE- FOR THE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT PROCESS OR LOCAL COASTAL PLAN. YES AND BUT MY QUESTION IS ONE IT NOW WOULD EXIST IF WE APPROVE THIS BILL FOR THE LOCAL COASTAL PLAN. DOES THAT IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH THE STREAMLINING AND DOESN'T GIVE SOMEBODY A BITE AT THE APPLE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE NOW TO DELAY THE HOUSING. THAT IS OE. AND WHEN I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY. IS THAT YOU UP SOMETHING IN THE BILL THAT LIMITS THE ABILITY AND TIME LINES. TO APPEAL OR DO SOMETHING WHICH- WOULD MAKE THE CASE THAT YOU'RE LIMITING THE ADDITIONAL BITE OF THE APPLE I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU HERE. AND I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO TELL US CLEARLY HOW THAT'S TRUE. I THINK IT IS TRUE BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHAT THIS DOES IS THIS PACKS BUT I AM REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO PROCESS THESE MOD MINISTERIAL LEE. OUT WITHIN A SPECIFIED TIMELINE. THE AND IS THAT A CITY PERMIT WITH THE COASTAL OVER LIFE GENERATES EXPEDITING VAT. IT'S NOT ADDING A SECOND COASTAL STREAMLINING. THAT IS ADDITIONALTIME EVEN THOUGH IT STREAMLINED RIGHT AND BACK TO MY CITY OF SAN DIEGO EXAMPLE THAT WAS THE PROBLEM WITH MANY HOMEOWNERS AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLY A ONE OR TWO YEAR ON STAFF FOR YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL BACK LOG. ON BUT WHY SHOULD I GO TO THE BACK F THE LINE THESE ARE EASILY THERE THERE'S NO. IMPACT IN SOMEBODY'S BACKYARD THERE'S YOU KNOW THESE ARE NEEDED HOUSING TYPES OF SHOULD BE EXPEDITED. AND THEN THERE'S- I'M I'M GONNA TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD ON THAT THE TO THE SECOND ISSUE IS THERE'S A UNIQUE THING IN THE COASTAL ACT. AND IN THE PROCESS AND THE UNIQUE THING IS. IS THAT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION GETS TO DECIDE. IF AN APPEAL WAS. WITH MERIT AND FORWARDED ON TO THE COMMISSION. SO PART OF YOUR- GIVING. THE IF SOMEBODY WAS A FRUIT. APPEAL AN EIGHTY. THAT THE ACOSTA. DIRECTOR BE M. TO DECIDE THAT IS NOT A VALID APPEAL OPENED AT THAT AS A BACKSTOP TO THE EXPEDITING VAT IS. THE STORY OF HERS YES BUT I'D LIKE TO ALLOW MY TO- WITNESS TO BE ABLE TO. MAYBE TALK TO A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THEIR INTERNAL PROCESS YOU MEAN SIR CHRISTIE. YOU MEAN SERRA CHRISTIE PACIFIST ON JUST SAID YOU'RE WITNESSING YOU HAD A FEW WITNESSES YES THAT'S OKAY. I'M FINE WITH HER ANSWERING THAT QUESTION A FEW STONE LET'S TURN THE LINE. MISS CHRISTY ARE YOU STILL WITH US. YES I AM DO YOU WANT TO JUMP IN HERE. SURE AND THAT SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR MOST RECENT QUESTION SENATOR WHERE IT IS YES THAT'S EXISTING LAWS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DOES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A- AND APPEAL AS FRIVOLOUS. SHE BEYOND THAT- IF IT'S NOT DEEMED PATENTLY FRIVOLOUS AT THE OUTSET IT GOES TO THE COMMISSION FOR WHAT'S CALLED A SUBSTANTIAL ISSUE HEARING WHERE IN THE COMMISSION CONFIRMS WHETHER OR NOT THE APPEAL RAISES A SUBSTANTIAL ISSUE ONE OF THE COSTA LACK SO- AND- THEN. LET ME ASK YOU FOLLOW QUESTION IS THERE SOMETHING AUTHOR OF THE BILL COMES DUE. R. TO SORT OF. PLEASE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IN A GOOD POSITION AND DETERMINING THAT- THING IS FRIVOLOUS BASED ON PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. WELL I WOULD SAY- THE EXISTING LAW COVERS THAT- IF THERE'S A WAY TO POTENTIALLY ADD SOME LANGUAGE TO MAKE THAT MORE CLEAR WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR OR TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. BUT AT THIS POINT YEAH BUT THE STATUTE AS WRITTEN. COVERS THAT- YOUR ONE NO THERE'S MORE STOPS FOR THIS BILL AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT DID YOU JUST CONSULT WITH THE AUTHOR AND- AND MAKE SURE THAT'S THE CASE AND MISTER CHAIR ON MY OWN TIME- I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK THAT'S THE CENTRAL ISSUE HERE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO WORK TOWARD IS MAKING SURE THIS IS NOT AN IMPEDIMENT- BECAUSE I JUST WATCHING IT JUST HAPPENED WITHIN AFFORDABLE HOUSING- PROPOSAL IN THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ WHERE. IT WAS APPEALED TO THE COMMISSION ON A HIKE LIMIT BUT THE HAWKS TAKING EIGHT FEET DOWN WOULD HAVE STRIPPED THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FROM THE PROJECT AND SO. IT I'M JUST CONCERNED THERE'S NOT SOMETHING IN IT FOR IN THIS BILL THAT IS AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT IT IS ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE FOR PEOPLE THAT. WANT TO GET IT THIS AND SO I HOPE AS YOU MOVE ON HE WILL CONSIDER THAT AND I THINK. I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO LOOK AT HOW THIS IS IMPLEMENTED IF IT IN FACT PASSES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO NOT. COME TO AFFECT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THE THING YOU LOOK AT IS JUST PEOPLE USING. AMANDA SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS USING C. QUOTE TO DECIDE WHETHER THE OAKLAND A SHOULD RELOCATE TO SAN JOSE THAT WAS NOT AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE. IT SO I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE WOULD USE THIS IN A WAY THAT HAS THE OPPOSITE IMPACT IN TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT SO. YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I THINK THAT'S THE PRISM WITH WHICH- YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THIS AS IT MOVES ALONG. THANKS FOR DOCTOR ME MR CHANNEL OF COURSE VERY INSIGHTFUL COMMENTARY AND A LOT OF DEEP EXPERIENCE ON THIS COMMITTEE- INCLUDING FROM THE AUTHOR ON THIS ISSUE AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE BILL WILL IF IT MOVES FOR TODAY IT'S GOING TO. GOVERNMENT'S FINANCE. I BELIEVE IN AND HOUSING AFTER THAT. WE WILL- THE HOUSING COMMITTEES I. IT WILL BE HER GUYS. ONE HEARING WITH CAN HOUSING- BUT I WOULD JUST ADD TO THE TO THE COLLEGE WE HEAR THAT- THAT. WELL YOU WELL YOU DON'T LOOK ONE TO SEE ANY CONSEQUENCES OF NEW PROCESS BECOME BEING SORT OF MISUSED EXPLOITED ALSO WOULD POINT OUT THAT NOTHING IN THIS MEASURE AS I UNDERSTAND IT- CONTRAVENES ANY OF THE EXISTING PROCESS SEES OR PROTECTIONS IN TERMS OF PERMITTING- ACT COASTAL SO THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED SAY ABOUT- ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE HABITAT AREAS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT NON HAZARDOUS USES AND I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENT ON FOCUSING ON WILDFIRE RISK- THAT THAT NOTHING IN THIS WOULD CONTRAVENE THOSE PROCESSES IMPEDING ACCESS FOR INSTANCE IT WOULDN'T BE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WOULD SOMEHOW TRUMP- ONE OF THOSE OTHER. KEY SORT OF CORE COASTAL COMMISSION CONSIDERATIONS BUT THAT THERE MAY BE- AS THIS IS IMPLEMENTED- MORE PUSH WINNER WHEN IT SOME NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IS PROPOSED FOR THAT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TO BE MORE AFFORDABLE I THINK THAT THAT LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR DOWN IN IMPERIAL BEACH AND CHULA VISTA-AND LOGAN I I'VE BEEN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES TO AND I. YEAH I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M SEEING ATTENTION ESPECIALLY FROM THE OPPOSITION TO IS HAVING THAT INCLUSIONARY ELEMENT. HAVING AFFORDABILITY ELEMENT IS REALLY- WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE TENSION BUT I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE NAVIGATING ALL THIS BRIEFLY- AND THAT YOU'RE SENSITIVE STILL TO THE UNDERLYING. INTEGRITY THE COASTAL ACT AS WELL THAT'S THE PURVIEW THIS COMMITTEE WERE NOT THE HOUSING COMMITTEE BUT- WE DON'T WANT TO SEE- FROM A RESOURCES PERSPECTIVE. ANYTHING THAT SUDDENLY THROWS THAT OUT THE WINDOW AND SAYS YOU KNOW IT'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF- YOU KNOW AN ENDANGERED GROVE- BUT I THINK WHAT WHAT WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS IF I NOTHER STADIUMS GOING UP RIGHT ON THE COAST WHY IN THAT STADIUM ALSO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS GOING INTO THAT COMMUNITY- IF ANOTHER MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IS GOING DOWN INTO IMPERIAL BEACH IS IT GONNA BE- YOU KNOW. SUPER HIGH END MARKET RAIDER THEY GONNA TAKE INTO ACCOUNT- SOME OF THE OTHER FACTORS ARE NOT TO INITIATE A NEW LAND USE PROCESS PER SE OR OPEN UP SOME NEW OTHER PERMITTING BUT REALLY- WITHIN EXISTING CITY P. PROCESSING- TOOK TO REALLY PUT THIS THUMB ON THE SCALE SO YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THIS FACTOR AND I THINK THAT EQUITY PIECES. IS WISE AND- I THINK YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD BALANCE HERE SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY- I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAD ANY OTHER COMMENTS ARE. COMING FROM CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION- AND MAYBE IF THE AUTHOR- CAN'T I DON'T. I THINK YOU CAN ANSWER IT BUT IF YOU CAN'T I'M SURE THE TWO PEOPLE WITH PREVIOUS CALLS TO QUESTION EXPERIENCE WOULD BE ABLE TO- THE BILL SAYS THAT. THE THAT TIME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO REQUIRE A COASTAL PLAN AND ADOPTED BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. IS THAT LENGTH OF TIME SUFFICIENT MEMORY AT THE END OF TWENTY ONE SO TWO YEARS IS THAT LENGTH OF TIME SUFFICIENT. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW SO IT SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR JUST THE PURPOSES OF AMENDING AND THE LANGUAGE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE STREAMLINING FOR THESE HOUSING TYPES. WHICH THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO PROVIDE SAMPLE LANGUAGE. BY JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO HAVE A NARROW FOCUSED. LCP AMENDMENT TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE TERMS OF THE BILL. I AM WITH MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR LAYERED LCP IS SORT LOCAL COASTAL PLAN HERE THANK YOU. I GOT INTO MY BILL RIGHT WORD THAT. EVERY SO YOU TO TALK TO US LIKE. RIGHT I RESPECT. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SIR. OKAY JUST JUST TO CLARIFY THE WHEN YOU SAY. STREAMLINED AND I WANT TO WE'RE GOING TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. THERE'S NO INTENT HERE TOO WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUE SAY OF SUBSTANTIALITY. TO DIMINISH OR CONTRAVENE ANY OF THE UNDERLYING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS IN THE COASTAL ACT- CASH- ACCESS ALL THOSE HAZARDOUS ISSUES ABSOLUTELY NOT NO COULD BE IN CONFLICT WITH THOSE- THOSE. REQUIREMENTS VERY GOOD OKAY- I WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION IF THERE'S NO FURTHER. SO SO THAT'S A MOTION. FROM SENATOR HUESO WHO ALSO HAS TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR IN THE MOTION WOULD BE DO PASSED AS AMENDED. THE FIRST AMENDED RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE- SOME MEMBER DO WANTED TO A CLOSE I REALLY APPRECIATE ON THE- THAT THE KNOWLEDGE BASE THE SUPPORT ON THE QUESTIONS WHICH I SHARE. THAT CONCERN AS WELL AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS- FINE TUNE I WILL BE DOING THAT WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS WOULD BE ON FUTURE STOP THE COMMITTEES AND THEIR CONSULTANTS AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS- AND OUT SHOULD THIS BECOME LAW IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE WATCHING CLOSELY ON HOW IT IMPLEMENTS.

AND MORE INTENSE WILD. AT THE REPRESENT OF A LEAD TO SAID. LATINO CAN. THESE ARE MORE THAN JUST CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES THEY'RE ALSO INVITED MENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES. A RECENT- POLITICAL ARTICLE ILLUSTRATED THAT IF YOU WERE TOOK OVER LIKE A MAP OF CORONAVIRUS HOT SPOTS AND EXTREME HEAT SPOTS THE MAP WOULD BE VIRTUALLY THE SAME. AREAS THAT EXPERIENCE EXTREME HEAT OFTEN HAVE LARGE EXPANSES OF CONCRETE LESS GREENERY HIGHER DENSITY HOUSING IN LOWER AVERAGE INCOMES AND POOR HEALTH STATUS. SENATORS DEATHS COULD BE PREVENTED IF WE WERE TO INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO MITIGATE EXTREME HATE. CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS CONTINUED INACTION WILL INCREASE HARDSHIPS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING DUE TO THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC. IT ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF THE PUBLIC'S OVERALL HEALTH. AB FIVE EIGHTY FIVE WILL BRING EQUITY TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES AND GIVE THEM A FIGHTING CHANCE TO BEAT THE HEAT.

AND I'M HERE TO ASK YOUR VOTE IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY FIVE. IN AN AVERAGE YEAR EXTREME HEAT CAUSE MORE DEATHS THAN HURRICANE FLOODS TORNADOES AND LIGHTNING COMBINED. AND SOME POPULATIONS TAKE A LARGER THREATEN OTHERS. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY OUR GREATEST RISK FROM EXTREME HEAT IT INCLUDES SENIORS ESPECIALLY THOSE LIVING ALONE MEMBERS IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES PEOPLE CRYING DISEASES OUTDOOR WORKERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN AND INFANTS. FOR MANY OF THESE AVAILABLE PEOPLE THE BIGGEST DRIVER OF HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS THE LACK OF ACCESS TO AIR CONDITIONED OR COOL SPACES. EVEN IF ONLY FOR A FEW HOURS. WE KNOW THERE ARE WAYS TO PREVENT HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES AND DEATHS. MY OWN WORK PUBLISHED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER USUALLY RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT HAVING ACCESS TO COOL SPACES SAVE LIVES. EVEN THE USE OF REFLECTIVE SURFACES OR TREE SHAPE CAN SAVE ONE FOR LIVES OTHERWISE LOST IN Q. TWO IF I REDUCING NEIGHBORHOOD AND HOME TEMPERATURES. OTHER COMMUNITY BASED STRATEGIES FROM PUBLIC HEALTH OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS TO INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS SUCH AS COMMUNITY CENTERS ARE IMPORTANT WAYS TO SHOW THE RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION ARE LOCALLY DRIVEN. TOGETHER THE SOLUTIONS NOT ONLY PROVIDE DAILY BENEFITS AND RESOURCES BUT ALSO SAVES LIVES. TAKE REALLY. IN LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. CALIFORNIA ALWAYS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF RESPOND TO CLIMATE CHANGE EXTREME HEAT IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS CALIFORNIANS PAY.

THE HEAT THAT HITS THE GROUND IT GOES UP TO THE BUT SURROUNDING BUILDINGS THEREFORE USUALLY HEATING THE SURROUNDING BUILDINGS AND SURROUNDING AREAS THEREBY REQUIRING MORE ENERGY TO COOL THOSE BUILDINGS SO SOMETIMES END UP WITH A SORT OF A PERVERSE EFFECT AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SO WE'RE CONCERNED WITH THAT AND THE L. THE ASSOCIATES REMAINS OPPOSED LESS AMENDED FOR REMOVED THE PROVISION ADDRESSING COOL PAVEMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY VERY GOOD. THANK MISS SIEVERS ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. NO OTHER LINES AND- OKAY- WELL THAT THAT THAT IS THE END OF PUBLIC TESTIMONY THEN- I'LL JUST SAY AT THE GATES I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE YOU IS THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE AT A MOMENT WHERE HE- IS THE- THE SECRET KILLER OUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WHEN WE'RE HITTING A HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES AND SILMAR PROCLAIM OUR- YOU KNOW CANOGA PARK- THIS ISN'T. THIS IS ACTUALLY TAKING LIVES NOW WE DON'T ALWAYS ACCOUNT FOR IT WE DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THE FULL IMPACT OF HEAT BUT- I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A DEDICATED SINGLE MINDED EFFORT THROUGH THIS LENS AND I THINK THAT THE POSITIONING OF THIS MEASURE WITHIN- OPR AND THE IG CARP PROCESS AND SORRY FOR THE ANALOGY BUT WITHIN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH OTHER SOMETHING CALLED THE INTEGRATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY PROGRAMS OF THIS WOULD SET UP ITS OWN- OFFICE UNDER THAT PROGRAM. THE BIG THE ONLY CONCERN I HAVE IS I DON'T WANT THESE PLANS TO END UP ON A SHELF WE WANT WE WANT THIS TO TAKE EFFECT I APPRECIATE THE REPORTING FUNCTION AND THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA BE BUDGETING IN THIS AREA AS WELL- I'M HOPING GOING FORWARD THAT. WE JUST. WE'VE WE FOCUS ON THOSE OUTCOMES AND REALLY TRYTO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE THIS LEGISLATION AS THE WAY TO HOLD THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO ACCOUNTABLE FOR FOLLOWING THROUGH- I THINK IT'S GOT ALL THE TOOLS TO DO THAT IT'LL BE ON US. GOING FOR TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BUT WHEN I THINK OF. THE IMPACT ON INFANT MORTALITY ON PREMATURE BIRTH- THE NEW STUDY THAT JUST CAME OUT ON THE IMPACT OF PREGNANT WOMEN AT THIRTY SIX THIRTY SEVEN WEEKS- THERE'S NEW RESEARCH THAT EMERGED. ON SUICIDE RATES AND MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS ACTUALLY JUMPING DURING TO HAVE A- I THINK IT'S A 5% UPTICK IN SELF HARM FIVE POINT SUICIDE. AND INTENTIONALLY AN INJURY IN HOMICIDE UP SEVEN POINT NINE PERCENT. FOR THE FIRST 10 DEGREES JUMP IN TEMPERATURE. THESE THESE ARE VERY REAL EFFECTS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT AREN'T REALLY MEASURED AS A CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUE PER SE BUT YOU BROUGHT THAT HUMANITY TO THIS SO. I AM LOOKING FORWARD IF THE BILL IS FOR TODAY TO BE ADDED ON TO THIS AND BE YOUR YOUR CO AUTHOR AND CO CHAMPION ON THIS MEASURE- THEY DON'T CALL IT. GLOBAL WARMING- FOR LACK OF A WE STARTED FOCUSING ON SEA LEVEL RISE IN WILDFIRE BUT THE HEAT IT'S ALL ABOUT PIZZA THANK YOU FOR YOU AND YOUR SPONSORS FOR BRINGING HE HAD TO LIKE. THE CENTER EGGMAN. BUT YOU AND THANK YOU FOR. BRING THIS PHOTO S. MEMBER AT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. IT SO WE KNOW THE ALL THE ISLAND IN MOSTLY IN IN CITY- THIS IS SO IS THERE GOING TO BE AN OVERALL PLAN THAT WILL. WILK ASSESS WHERE THOSE AREAS ARE OR IS IT UP TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S WEED COMMUNITY FOCUSED. OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TO IDENTIFY THE ISSUES AND THEN. APPLY TO THE STATE IN A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO GET FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE HEAT. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. IF THAT IS IF I IF I AM CORRECT IN THAT WHAT. WHAT IS THE MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT- BECAUSE WHAT I THINK WHAT WE FIND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS WE PROVIDE THESE GRANT FUNDING CONSERVE OUR- POOREST AND MOST AT RISK COMMUNITIES DON'T APPLY FOR THEM. IS OFTENTIMES THEY DON'T HAVE THE STAFF POWER OR- OR SOMETIMES EVEN POLITICS GET AWAY ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK IS REALLY WHAT PEOPLE THINK. IS NOT REAL- AND THEN WE END UP WITH. THE POOREST COMMUNITIES NOT BEING ABLE TO GET ACCESS. TO THE PLANS. THE VERY GOOD INTENTIONS WE HAVE. TO IMPROVE LIVES YOU DRESSED OUT OVER. THIS BILL- WILL THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH WILL ALSO COORDINATE THE STATE'S EFFORTS RIGHT- THAT DEAL WITH EXTREME HEAT. I AGREE WITH YOU THAT A LOT OF TIMES WE CREATE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS BUT THEN. ARE MOST. IMPACTED COMMUNITIES DON'T APPLY BECAUSE OF MAYBE HUMAN RESOURCES RIDER- THEY'RE NOT AS COMPETITIVE AND- I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT FOR A LONG TIME YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETIMES THAT HAS HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT- AND I THINK. YOU'RE RIGHT AND I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN THIS PROGRAM AND I'M YOU KNOW DEFINITELY DEDICATED TO THAT. IT AND THEY'LL BE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE REAR TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT COMMUNITIES ARE ACTUALLY USING IT- AND WHAT THEY ARE. GONNA WE GONNA BE ABLE TO MEASURE ANY KIND OF HEAT REDUCTION OR THE IMPACTS AND I'M HOPING THAT THE THIS PROGRAM WILL BE THEN COORDINATED WITH LIKE AN URBAN GREENING PROGRAM YEAH AND TO OUR IS THERE GONNA BE SOME KIND OF A ONE APPLICATION WOULD BE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE EVERYTHING. THAT THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE COORDINATED- TOGETHER OR A CONNECTED TOGETHER I GUESS THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEGINNING OF COORDINATING THESE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND EFFORTS THAT THE STATE RUNS TOWARDS REDUCING HEAT- RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE. IT IS NOT ONLY FOR URBAN AREAS- INTO THESE THOSE ARE GREAT POINTS THAT YOU'RE MAKING AN I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH YOU- AND THAT'S MY INTENTION OF THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL COORDINATE THAT. AND ALSO BOB DO THE OUTREACH YOU KNOW PART OF- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE IN THIS GRANT PROGRAM ARE ALSO PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS AROUND HE NOT JUST TECHNOLOGIES OR LIKE URBAN GREENING- AND SO IT IS UP TO THE LOCAL. ENTITIES TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS ON WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. BUT I WANT THE STATE TO ALSO- YOU KNOW PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AND EXAMPLES OF WHAT CAN BE DONE AND THAT'S WHY WE LISTED SOME OF THESE. PROGRAMS ARE TECHNOLOGIES IN THIS BILL THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED- IN A LIKE FOR EXAMPLE COOL PAVEMENTS AS US SOMEONE MENTIONED IN THE TESTIMONY. IT IS NOT REQUIRED BUT IT IT'S A WAY TO. UP TO LET OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE AREA THAT THEY CAN FOCUS ON. IF THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY OKAY. SO I GET TO DO. THE ONE THING I JUST ALWAYS TRIED TO RESIST IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BUILD SHE COULDN'T CREATE ANOTHER SILO THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO APPLY TO INDIVIDUALLY. PERSON BEING ABLE TO SAY HERE'S OUR PROBLEM WHAT DO WE WHAT WE QUALIFY FOR- AND THEN THIS IS NOT YOUR ISSUE BUT I THINK IN ALL OF OUR BILLS GOING FORWARD IT WOULD BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO BUILD AND- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE. ON THAT ACTUAL GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS. WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN THIS PROGRAM IS CREATED THERE WILL BE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO COMMENT ON WHO SHOULD APPLY AND HOW AND SO THAT'S BUILT INTO THIS. PROGRAM AND I WOULD JUST ADD A COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ALSO DO AUTHORIZED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- BOTH FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ELIGIBLE ENTITIES AND THEN THE REPORT JUST TO BE CLEAR IS IT IT'S NOT AN ANNUAL REPORT THERE'S A ONE TIME IN JULY TWENTY THREE. BUT THE ACTIONS THAT THEY'RE ANALYZING INCLUDING ASSESSMENT OF ALL STATE PROGRAMS- SO THAT'S ON PAGE SEVEN EIGHT IF THAT- YES SIR JUST TO WATCH THAT INCLUDING UNMET GAPS POTENTIAL GAPS- IN THE STATE'S APPROACH- BUT I AGREE THAT EQUITY. REALLY NEEDS TO ALSO BE A DRIVING FORCE HERE AND I KNOW THAT'S THE HEART OF YOUR COMMUNITY TOO SO- I THINK IT'S AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE A BILL A LITTLE LATER TODAY AND BILLS IN THE NEXT TO ME HEARING IS A LOT OF OVERLAPPING WORK GOING ON IN THE ADAPTATION OF RESILIENCY SPACE SO THE IDEA OF COHESION HEARING YOUR CROSS REFERENCE TO THE OTHER PROCESS HE'S I THINK IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. TO SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA THERE'S A STATE WIDE PLAN IN THIS SORT OF ASSIST WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE GRANDSON URBAN GREENING BUT AGREED GETTING ALL THAT TO WORK ONE FRONT DOOR WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT I KNOW CENTER GROVE HAD A COMMENT AND THEN SENATOR JONES. SAWYER GROWTH. THANK YOU MISTER. SO I THINK ROSHI BUYER EXPERIENCES IN LIFE AND OBVIOUSLY KERN COUNTY HAS DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES THAN LA- THE COASTAL AREA AND- BEING A BUSINESS OWNER IN WHAT I CALL THE REAL WORLD. WE ALWAYS TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS IS LIKE WHAT'S THE ROOT CAUSE FOR EXPENSES TO GO UP FOR WHAT'S THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE INJURY TO TAKE PLACE. AND THEN IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A THE CONTINUOUS BANDAID OR A FIX IT ON ON WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS. SO FIRST OF ALL TO SAY THAT I DO BELIEVE IT'S FILLED ENERGY POLICIES IN THE STATE M. BECAUSE THAT BECAUSE- ELECTRICITY RATES TO GO SO HIGH YOU KNOW CALIFORNIANS IF YOU LOOK AT IT I THINK IT'S TWENTY TWO CENTS. IT'S ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION'S IF NOT THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION'S SO WHEN YOU LIVE IN AN AREA IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY LIKE MYSELF FOR- MY COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON. AND WE'RE DIFFERENT THAN THE CHAIRMAN AND HERE BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST OPEN A WINDOW AT NIGHT AND- HAVE YOUR BREEZE BLOW THROUGH AT OUR HOUSE GETS CALLED OFF. PARDON ME. OKAY M. SO M. I JUST THINK THAT- IF ELECTRICITY RATES WEREN'T SO BAD AND WE HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST- YOU KNOW POOR DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS FARMWORKERS PREDOMINATELY LATINO POPULATION IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT- YOU KNOW CAN'T AFFORD AN EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR A MONTH UTILITY BILL OR SEVEN HUNDRED OR MONTH UTILITY BILL SO- I THINK THE ROOT CAUSE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND THE COST IS THE COST OF UTILITIES BUT IN THE MEANTIME. I THINK THAT- YOUR BILL DOES DO SOME GOOD RIGHT FOR THE TO THE GRANT PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE PEOPLE TO APPLY FOR THEM SO THAT- YOU KNOW IF COUNTIES OR CITIES WANTED TO PUT TOGETHER SOME STUFF IT WOULD BE- YOU TO BE BENEFICIAL ESPECIALLY FOR THE AREAS THAT WE CAN APPLY FOR THE GRANT FROM PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE IN THE BILL- I APPRECIATE YOU CLARIFYING MR SIEVERS- CONCERN. OVER AT DID YOU KNOW PAVE AN ISSUE. BECAUSE AGAIN IN THIS BUILDING WE TEND TO LOOK AT THINGS FROM A TEN THOUSAND FOOT VIEW. AND WE THINK THAT. IF WE DO THIS IT WILL FIX THIS BUT WHEN IT'S IN THE REAL WORLD. N. LIKE MR SIEVERS ASCRIBE YOU KNOW THE REFLECTION OF THE PAVEMENT COULD CAUSE THE BUILDINGS. TO BE- THE HARDER TO COOL IN THE SUMMER TIMES- EVEN THOUGH IT'S A GOOD CAUSE TO HAVE LOWER HEATED AND- THAT PAVEMENT. SO M. G. ALL THAT TO SAY. THAT I LIKE YOUR BILL AM I DO I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT AND I DO WANT TO JUST ASK ONE QUESTION I DIDN'T SEE A FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE GRANT. I GUESS SAM WE CURRENTLY- SUBMITTED A BUDGET REQUEST OKAY FOR THIS SO IT IS ON UP UPON APPROPRIATION OF THE LEGISLATURE OKAY CAN YOU TELL WHAT THE AMOUNT IS. WHAT THE REQUEST WITH. YOU I CAN GET BACK TO YOU OF ANY GREAT THE GUY I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE IT- SO ANYWAYS BUT I APPRECIATE YOU LETTING. ME TO MAKE MY COMMENTS OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS YEAH. IN THIS BEFORE. THANKS AND GROWTH- CENTER JONES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- JUST REAL QUICK ON THE MOTION ON THIS. DOES IT. IS IT DAHLE REFERRED WHERE DOES IT GO FROM HERE. IT'S GOING TO- EQ. AFTER ALL OKAY AND THEN APPROACH. THE MEASURE YES YES THE COURSE I HAD THE SAME CONCERNS AS CENTER GROVE ON THE FUNDING SO APPRECIATE IF YOU CAN GET BACK TO ALL OF US ON THAT I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT QUESTION- AND THEN BUT REGARDING THE PAVEMENT ASSOCIATION. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY'RE ASKING FOR PRETTY SIMPLE. AMENDMENT- K. USE ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE THAT A MEMBER OR IF NOT WHY NOT ARE YOU CAN YOU TALK TO A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW THIS BILL IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL WE'RE NOT PRESCRIBING COOL PAVEMENTS TO ALL LOCAL ENTITIES RIGHT IT IS UP TO THE NEEDS. OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS- AND I'M I'M NOT WILLING TO REMOVE THAT AS AN OPTION. FOR A LOCAL ENTITY TO MAKE ON THEIR OWN DEPENDING ON THEIR NEEDS OKAY SO IT AT MY UNDERSTANDING THEN. IS IT'S OPTIONAL. IT IS OKAY GOT IT OKAY WE LISTED SEVERAL- THINGS THAT. THE PROGRAM CAN FIND GREAT IN. IN THIS BILL BUT IT EVERY LOCAL ENTITY WILL MAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES THANK YOU. PICTURE JONES AND I WOULD JUST ADD LASTLY THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ALSO SAYS TO AVOID MALAH ADAPTATION SIR IS IT AS A GENERAL ISSUE SO WHAT THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT OF CONCERN THAT. SOMEHOW COOL PAVEMENT PROJECT WOULD HAVE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE I THINK WE DEALT WITH AND- THE NEW. YOU'RE A BIN MAN SAW AND- PAGE DATA THE ANALYSIS THERE SO- ROBUST DISCUSSION APPRECIATED ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. SEEING NONE HELLO ASK YOU TO CLOSE SURE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS DISCUSSION AND ALL OF THE COMMENTS. AND CONCERNS I THINK IT SHOWS THAT WE ARE ALL INTERESTED.

EIGHTY EIGHT HUNDRED ACRE LAND WITH THE LAND CONSERVATION EASEMENT ON IT OR THEY DID A PRESCRIBED FIRE ONE SIDE IT WAS THE ONLY HOMES THAT WERE SAVED IN THE AREA OF THAT FIRE WERE PROTECTED BY THAT ONE PARTICULAR. PRESCRIBED BURN AND- THE HISTORIC- TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE AREA ARE WORKING WITH THEM ABOUT THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND UNDERSTANDING PRESCRIBED FIRE AND IT IS A NATURAL FIT WITH YOUR WITH YOUR BILL. AND CENTER EGGMAN WILL ROLLER I SAT MY- A LATE IS SHAMELESS- A PLUG FOR THE FACT THAT WE RESTORED A YOU SEE AG COOPERATIVE EXTENSION IN THE BUDGET YESTERDAY AND ADDED TO ACROSS THE STATE AND YOU HAVE CALLED THEM OUT FOR DOING EDUCATION AND- HOPEFULLY THEY WILL HAVE MORE RESOURCES TO DO THAT GIVEN THE BUDGET THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE. ADOPTED IN TWO I HAVE A BILL THAT IS NOT REFERENCED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT MOVING THIS YEAR THAT TAKES THE ACTION PLAN OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY PUTS IT OVER FIVE YEARS- TO SORT OF PLAN FOR EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE pDOING BUT TO SIGNIFICANT PIECE IN RELATION TO YOUR BILL. IS THAT IT ACTUALLY TRACKS AND HAS A TRANSPARENT WAY. TO DETERMINE WHAT IS DONE EVERY YEAR GETS THE GOALS ON PRESCRIBED FIRE FEW MANAGEMENT FORCE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER PRACTICES AND SO. IF AND WHEN THIS BILL PASSES THERE WILL BE A WIDE TRACK. OF WHETHER OR NOT IT ACHIEVES WHAT THE DESIRED GOALS OR A NEW WAY TO TRACK HOW MUCH THE ACREAGE ACTUALLY IS THAT IS EXPERIENCED BY IT. SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL I SEE YOU A BROAD SUPPORT AND NO OPPOSITION INTO A HOBBY HAPPY TO MOVE IT WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU A CENTER GROVE. AND THEN CENTER EGGMAN S. THANK YOU MISTER. IT'S A EATING THE CREEK FIRE. SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES MY FAMILY HAS CAMPED UP THERE EVERY YEAR AT ABOVE SHAVER LAKE AT HUNTINGTON LAKE. IN THE CREEK FIRE CAME THROUGH IS IT WAS PRETTY DEVASTATING NOT ONLY FOR. THAT BEAUTIFUL AREA UP THERE IN THIS YEAR FOR NATIONAL FOREST BUT FOR WILDLIFE- FOR WILDLIFE FOR THE HORSES IN THE CATTLE THE- YOU KNOW. THERE'S A LOT OF RANCHERS INCLUDING ARRANGING FAMILIES THAT AT LEAST WITH THE FOR SERVICE AND JUST TO GET IN AND GET THEIR CATTLE OUT AND- YOU KNOW A GROUP OF PEOPLE LEFT KERN COUNTY AND WENT UP THERE TO HELP- ONE. PARTICULAR FLAG RANCHER THAT IS WELL KNOWN AND- YOU KNOW. THEY WERE GETTING CATTLE OUT WITH BURNED HIS LIKE YOU KNOW WE'RE ANIMALS GO RIGHT WHEN THAT HAPPENS. AND I'VE OFTEN ADVOCATED FOR UNIFICATION MANAGEMENT AND PRESCRIBED BURNS THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW CAMPING UP THERE FOR YOU KNOW SINCE I WAS A KID- AND MY MOM AND DAD BEFORE THAT- YOU KNOW EAST BILL TO GO TO OUR CAMPSITE A WALK DIRECTLY TO THE LAKE. AND NOW YOU CAN'T DO THAT M. YOU HAVE TO WALK ALL THE WAY AROUND BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH VEGETATION ON THE GROUND- AND SMALL TREES THAT YOU CAN'T GET TO THE LAKE. AND I THINK THAT JUST- PER VOIGTS KINDLING AT YOU KNOW FUEL FOR THESE FIRES AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE HAD SUCH A DEVASTATING LOSS WITH THE CREEK FIRE. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR BILL AND THANK YOU M. FOR BRING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SCHERING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE EVERY. TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX AND I THINK PRESCRIBERS HAVE NOT BEEN USED AS MUCH AS WE KNOW HISTORICALLY IT'S- IT IS A WAY TO KEEP WORKFORCE CLEAN- I. ALSO HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE AREA WHERE THE CREEK FIRE OCCURRED AND WE LOST MY DAD SOLD OFF THE GRID CABIN. AND CHOSE NOT TO EVEN THINK ABOUT REBUILDING AS A BURN TO THE GROUND JUST BECAUSE THE DEVASTATION IS SO MASSIVE THAT. I DON'T THINK IN MY LIFETIME THAT AREA. WE'RE WEEK WHERE WE HIKED AND FISHED WELL WE'LL BE BACK. IN ANY WAY THAT I CAN ENJOY IT. SO I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I HOPE THAT WHEN THE PLANS ARE DEVELOPED ACTUALLY ENCOMPASS- I MEAN REALLY LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF SPACE THAT NEEDS TO BE. CUPBOARD AND ENTREATED. AND THAT IT IS ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT LARGER. AREAS I THINK SOMETIMES WE DO IN SMALL PATCH AREAS WHICH ISN'T AS EFFECTIVE SO. HOPEFULLY WILL MOVE TOWARDS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. THAT WILL INCLUDE ALL ALL PROPERTY OWNERS AS IT GOES FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WE DO HAVE A PROMOTION FROM CENTER LAYERED I'LL JUST SAY I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP. IN THIS AREA YOU'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR A WHILE. WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THAT CRITICAL MODEL COMPONENT OF YOUR LEGISLATION WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN LAW YEARS AGO- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSISTENCE ON THAT ESPECIALLY THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND SORT OF THAT ROLE OF MODELING RISK- MAYBE THEY'LL BEAT US TO TH PUNCH HERE AND- GET MOVING. BUT I APPRECIATE THESE BILLS MOVING TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS THE ONE THING I WANTED TO NOTE- YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS ALSO. AN IMPORTANT TRUST BUILDING EXERCISE IN THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS HE'S HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET PEOPLE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT. THIS CAN DO- BUT IT DOES NOT. EXPRESSLY DOES NOT CONTRAVENE ANYTHING IN EXISTING LAW THE WAY THE COMMITTEE IS READY TO. TO EXACERBATE ANY TYPE CONVERSION WE KNOW THAT AFTER SOME FIRES- INVASIVES COME BACK IN SO. IN AREAS. WHERE THERE ARE AT THE CHAPARRAL AND COASTAL SAGE SCRUB. IF YOU PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT AND THEN IT COMES BACK AS MUSTARD WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED AND WE'LL SEE IS ALL THE CHAPARRAL IS GONE AND NOW WE HAVE TEN FOOT HIGH COMBUSTIBLE INVASIVE GRASSES. AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES- THE BILL- SORT OF NAVIGATES THROUGH THAT THAT COMPLEXITY I THINK ASTUTELY SO I APPRECIATE THAT. IT'S NOT A SORT OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH BUT YOU ARE BUILDING TRUST. AND PUSHING HIS PRACTICE FOR WHERE WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE- SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION- DO YOU WANT TO CLOSE. THE ONLY THING THAT I'LL ADD IS THAT. ALSO PART OF THE MODELING BESIDES REDUCING RISK IS TO REWARD COMMUNITIES THAT THAT ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF REMEDIATION AND DO A LOT OF WORK. AND THAT POSSIBLY INSURANCE COMPANIES REALIZING THAT THEY HAVE REDUCED THE RISK AND REWARDING THEM WITH LOWER INSURANCE RATES IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WOULD THIS COULD HELP FOSTER AND- I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS THAT YOU ALL MADE IN THE SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH- THE MOTION IS. TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION- SHE CANCELED WHICH PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

A FEW DAYS AGO WE'VE GOT RECORD BREAKING FLOODS IN DETROIT AND EXPLOSIVE WILDFIRES RISING SEA LEVELS ALL OF THE SIGNS THAT ARE COMMON REALITY- CRISIS IS HERE AND AN URGENT CALL TO ACTION. AND WHILE THE LEGISLATURE HAS ENACTED FRAMEWORKS AND ENDORSE VARIOUS POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. WE STILL LACK GOVERNANCE PARTICIPATION AND METRICS ON CRITICAL PARTY ACTIONS AND TIMELINES TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE ADAPTATION GOALS AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL. IN THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THAT GAP OF BY ASKING THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TO DEVELOP AND COORDINATE A STRATEGIC RESULT RESILIENCY FRAMEWORK. THAT WILL OUT TIMETABLES AND METRICS TO MEASURE PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING THAT FRAMEWORK AND FACILITATE TIMELY CONCRETE ACTION. AND ALSO TO ELEVATE EQUITY AS A AS A CONSIDERATION BY IDENTIFYING.

THE IMPACTS TO PEOPLE IMPACTS THE NATURE INTO OUR COMMUNITY. THERE'S MUCH TO DO AND THAT MUCH NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PREPARE FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION. SOME IS ALREADY BEEN DONE AND SENATOR LIAR GO THROUGH THE SAFEGUARDING PLAN- BUT OTHER WORK STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE AS YOU HEARD EARLIER TODAY I HEARD SENATOR EGGMAN MENTION I NEED TO THINK ABOUT MEASURING COORDINATING.

CLEARLY WE WANT TO PUT EQUITY AT THE FRONT OF THAT POLICY WE THINK AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY QUARTERBACK. AND FINALLY IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT WHAT THE STATE DOES AND HOW THE STATE THINKS ABOUT CLIMATE ADAPTATION. NO MATTER WHAT WE SAY WE NEED TO BE WORKING WITH ON THE VARIOUS REGIONS AND MAKE SURE THERE'S ULTIMATE PRETTY PRETTY COORDINATION GOING ON THERE. FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS WARRANT SUPPORT TODAY.

WELCOME TO THE MORNING CARE AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DIANA WINE AND I'M THE CHAIR OF THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY CHAPTER OF THE CLIMATE REALITY PROJECT CLIMATE REALITY PROJECT MISSION IS TO CATALYZE A GLOBAL SOLUTION TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS BY MAKING URGENT ACTION A NECESSITY ACROSS EVERY SECTOR OF SOCIETY TODAY I'M HONORED TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL. THE BILL WILL REQUIRE STATE AGENCIES TO COLLABORATIVELY ENGAGE WITH REGIONAL AND LOCAL ENTITIES AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP AND COORDINATE STRATEGIC RESILIENCY FRAMEWORK THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.-CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST CLIMATE CHALLENGE REGIONS IN NORTH AMERICA IN THE LOS ANGELES REGION SPECIFICALLY IT IS EXPECTED TO WARM FOUR TO FIVE DEGREES BY MID CENTURY. AND THE YEARLY NUMBER OF DAYS OVER NINETY FIVE DEGREES IS PROJECTED TO ALMOST QUADRUPLE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. CLIMATE SCIENTISTS HAVE PREDICTED THAT THE SEA LEVEL WILL RISE ALONG THE CALIFORNIA COAST FIVE TO TWENTY FOUR INCHES. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIFTY. TIED TO THE STORM SURGE CAN CAUSE COASTAL FLOODING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY WHEN BIG WAVES STORMS OCCUR AT HIGH TIDE. LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALSO SUFFERS FROM SOME OF THE WORST AIR POLLUTION IN THE COUNTRY WHICH IS THE PROBLEM WORSENED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. QATAR TEMPERATURES SPEED UP CHEMICAL REACTIONS THAT CREATE GROUND LEVEL OZONE WHICH IS THE MAIN COMPONENT OF SMOG. GROUND LEVEL OZONE IS LINKED TO ASTHMA BRONCHITIS HEART ATTACKS AND PREMATURE DEATH. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE STATE TAKE ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMAN GABRIEL WILL CREATE COORDINATED GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS ON CRITICAL PRIORITY ACTIONS.

ZERO WELL KNOWN QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME MISTER OKAY VERY GOOD WILL BRING IT BACK- COME IN BURSTS ORDER THEN MR LAYERED AND THEN THE SECOND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THE END TO THE AUTHOR I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE DIRECTION IN THIS AND- IT WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE SEARCH. THE COR IS SO AND IS. A WAS A MEMBER OF THE ST GROWTH COUNCIL FOR EIGHT YEARS SO I GUESS WHAT YOU'RE TO DO A OF. IN THE ONE IS- PROTON HAS A MAJOR SEA LEVEL RISE THE NOT REFERENCED IN THE ANNOUNCES THAT ACTUALLY. UP A PROCESS. AND A CALL. FOR DRESSINGS LEVEL RISE AND I HEARD THE WITNESSES MENTIONED IT AND- HOW WHAT STEPS WILL YOU. TAKE TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF HER BILL WAS ENACTED AND SIGNED INTO LAW AND THIS IS SIGNED INTO LAW THERE'S NOT SOME DUPLICATION HERE HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR AND IT'S A IT'S A ACTUAL QUESTION AND YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BUILD ON A LOT OF THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE IN YOUR UNIT IN PREVIOUS ROLES TO HELP TO GET US TO THIS MOMENT- WE SEE THIS REALLY IS BEING OUT OF IT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF FRAMEWORK THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE. WORKING ON A LOT OF ISSUE AREAS IN MORE SPECIFIC DETAIL COMMENT AS YOU MAY KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN HAS% ABOUT WORKING ON REGIONAL CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION SO. WE THINK IT'S COMPLIMENTARY TO THAT AS WELL SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE IN CONVERSATION WITH EVERYBODY THAT'S WORKING IN THE SPACE. BUT WE THINK THESE EFFORTS ARE ULTIMATELY COMPLEMENTARY AND THAT THERE COULD BE LOTS OF EFFORTS ON PARTICULAR THINGS. WHETHER BE WILDFIRE MITIGATION WHETHER B. C. LEVEL RISE WHETHER BE OTHER ISSUES WHERE WE CAN FOCUS ON THE POLICY AND MORE- GRANO DETAIL. BUT ALSO HELP TO HAVE COORDINATION AT THE TOP LEVEL SO THAT ALL OF THIS CAN ULTIMATELY BE MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. AND I'M PRESENTED TO PROTECT HIS BILL IN ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES. I GUESS I WAS JUST LAST WEEK AND SO I WOULD JUST SUGGEST. THAT YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC CONVERSATION WITH OUR STAFF. IN CASE THERE'S A WAY. THAT YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY SPECIFIED IN YOUR BILL BUT THEY'RE NOT IN CONFLICT OR OR DEAL WITH IT ANNOYS IT'S GOOD. SECOND AND THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD IS. THEIR NUMBER VOICE TO GO WITH THIS WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. YEAH I'LL JUST SAY ON YOUR ON ON THE PLAYMATE ABSOLUTELY AND WE WILL DEFINITELY REACH OUT TO THE PART TIME AND I THINK THAT'S A WELL TAKEN POINT- SO IT'S SO IT'S SO THANK YOU FOR THAT- SO. OUR OUR ASSUMPTION ALL ALONG IS THAT ULTIMATELY THIS WOULD BE A CONVERSATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN THAT YOU KNOW REASONABLE MINDS COULD DISAGREE ABOUT. SHOULD THIS BE HOUSED IN OPR SERVICE BECAUSE THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE STRATEGIC ACCOUNTS AND WE DECIDED TO. BEGIN WITH THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL BECAUSE REPRESENTATIVES. FROM BOTH OF THOSE ENTITIES AND IS A PLACE WHERE FOLKS CAN GET TOGETHER- AND HOPEFULLY HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT ULTIMATELY WE THINK THAT THAT'LL BE A CONVERSATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND WORKING WITH THEM TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THIS IS ULTIMATELY SO IN MANY WAYS THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCILS A STARTING POINT FOR YOU AND YOU'LL SEE HOW THEY RESPOND. CORRECT I THE ONE. ON MY OWN TIME MISTER CHAIR THE ONE OBSERVATION I WOULD. MAKE IS THAT. THE SORT OF A THE ONE HAND ON THE OTHER HAND WITH THAT. IT ON THE ONE HAND IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT'S DESIGNED TO COORDINATE ANOTHER CAT A NUMBER OF CABINET LEVEL SECRETARIES. SO THAT YOU GET INTO EVERY PLACE TO ISSUE MIGHT EXIST. IN MANAGING IT AND THERE ARE PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS AND- AND IN THE PAST I DON'T KNOW WHO'S THERE NOW THE PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS ADDRESSED. EQUITY A IN A WAY TO MOVE THAT INTO THE CONVERSATION. THE FLIP SIDE OF IT IS. IS IF EVERYBODY SORT OF HAS A LITTLE RESPONSIBILITY NOBODY HAS THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY AND- YOU COULD. GET A SITUATION WHERE NOBODY SHEPHERDING IT NOBODY'S REALLY MAKING SURE THAT IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS AND SO. I WOULD JUST HOPE YOU WOULD HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. IT IN A TIMELY BASIS BECAUSE THE REAL ISSUE IS MAKING SURE THIS HAPPENS AND MAKING SURE THIS HAPPENS IN A GOOD WAY ADMINISTRATIVE PLAN SO. I'M GONNA BE HAPPY TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY AND REALLY SALUTE YOU. I JUST THINK YOU STILL NEED TO WORK ON A COUPLE OF THOSE ISSUES AND- SO THAT THIS. DOES THE BEST IT CAN BE AS A CONSOLE SO I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH PARTICULARLY GIVEN YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR PRIOR EXPERIENCE HERE IN THE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU BRING TO IT AND- YOU KNOW WE SOUGHT TECHNICAL EXPERTISE FROM VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS IN ABOUT PASSED THE ADMINISTRATION FOR. THEIR THOUGHTS ALREADY ON AMENDMENTS WERE JUST WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM THEM BUT I HEAR EXACTLY WHAT. YOU'RE SAYING WILL CERTAINLY HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM. AT THE MOMENT THANK YOU- AT AND I WOULD NEVER ROLL MY EYES. AT MONEY FOR DO YOU SEE AG EXTENSION SENATOR LAYER TO LAST LAST POINT- AND I AM NOT AS KNOWLEDGEABLE AS- AS THE FINE SENATOR FORMER SECRETARY. SO FOR ME WHO SOMEONE WHO REALLY LIKES TO FOCUS ON OUTCOMES AND RIGHT HAS BEEN HERE QUITE AWHILE AND THE KEEP DOING THINGS AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WE- FOLLOW THROUGH WITH REAL OUTCOMES. WHY IF WE ALREADY HAVE. MANY PEOPLE WORKING IN THE SPACE WHY NOT JUST MAYBE DO MORE. TO SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA MANDATES THAT PROGRAM IS ALREADY EXISTING AS THE CENTER LAYERED AND SAYS IN THE WE ONE PERSON RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE- I THINK. THE LAST THING ANYBODY WANTS THAT WE'VE SEEN TO THIS IS FINGER POINTING THIS WAY OR THE OTHER WAY. SO WHY NOT. SIX IMPORTANT WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE VERSUS BEGINNING SOMETHING NEW. YEAH IT'S A GREAT POINT SENATOR AND I THINK THAT THE THRUST OF THIS BILL IS TO IS TO MOVE FROM PLAN INTO ACTION RIGHT AND THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GOOD WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE SPACE BUT HOW DO WE TAKE IT TO THE NEXT STEP HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. MEASURABLE DEMONSTRABLE OUTCOMES THAT ARE GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE FORWARD HERE- THEY WERE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WE WANT TO DO THAT IN A WAY THAT SENSITIVE TO ALL THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE HERE- GOING BACK OVER OVER A DECADE AND BUILT ON THAT DOESN'T RECREATE THE WELL BUT LEVERAGES WHAT WE'VE BEEN DONE AND REALLY YOU KNOW AT SOME SOME SOME TEETH AND SOME HAVE TO IT AND MOVED IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. SO THAT IS A THAT THAT'S VERY MUCH THE INTENT HERE AGAIN I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THIS IS IMPORTANT BURKE- AND THIS BILL I THINK STILL HAS A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN THE SECOND HOUSE NOW SO- I APPLAUD YOU BUT LET'S LET'S MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO. IS BE CREATING MORE FRAMEWORKS AND STRATEGIES THAT THAT THAT WOULD THAT WE NEVER ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT AND UP THAT THE CITIZENS NEVER ACTUALLY SEE THE BENEFIT OF. A GIFT. THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN- COMMITTEE CENTER AROUND- ARE YOU KNOW I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR IS ENGAGED IN THIS ISSUE AND- CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE COULD HAVE SUPPORTED TODAY.

YOU KNOW WE WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT JUST DOESN'T BECOME A REPORT THAT SITS ON A SHELF BUT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY MOVES US TO ACTION THAT RESULTS IN IN YOU KNOW OUTCOMES THAT ARGUE THAT WE pNEW REALITY WITH OUR CLIMATE SITUATION AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE THRUST HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW SENATE COMMITTEE MOVES FOR TODAY REALLY LOOK FOR TO THAT CONVERSATION WITH YOUR STAFF CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE STAFF HERE AND HOPEFULLY GET TO SOMETHING WE ALL FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT.

MISTER ALLEN'S GONNA PRESENT A FILE ITEM TWO IS THAT CORRECT. ARE YOU UP FOR THAT MISTER ALLEN WE HAVE HE SLOTTED YES TO A PRISON AB SEVENTY. REGARDING THE DOMINGUEZ CHANNEL WATERSHED IN SANTA CATALINA ISLAND. YES. HE DON'T YOU SOME TENTATIVE NO NO I MEAN THIS IS THIS A SLIMMER AND HONESTLY JUST ASK ME TO GET SENATE- THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD EXPAND THE TERRITORY THE SAN GABRIEL AND LOWER LOS ANGELES RIVERS. AND MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY TO INCLUDE THE DOMINGUEZ CHANNEL WATERSHED IN THE SOUTHWEST PORTION OF L. A. COUNTY. CANNELLA AND ALSO CATALINA ISLAND. NASA SAID THAT SINCE ITS ESTABLISHMENT TWENTY YEARS AGO THE RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY A SUCCESSFULLY PURSUED A MISSION OF PRESERVING OPEN SPACE AND HABITAT WHILE FACILITATING PUBLIC ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA'S WILDERNESS AND WILDLIFE. BY PROVIDING GRANTS TO VARIOUS PROJECTS THROUGHOUT ITS TERRITORY IN EASTERN IOWA AND WESTERN ORANGE COUNTY THE CONSERVANCY IS IMPROVE WATERSHEDS RESTORED WILDLIFE HABITAT AND PROVIDED NUMEROUS OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOLKS FROM ALL OVER THE L. A. REGION- WHILE THE CONSERVANCY HAS HAD GREAT SUCCESS WITH NUMEROUS PROJECTS WITHIN ITS TERRITORY SEVERAL NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES AND NOT HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES. HOW THE DIMMING IS CHANNEL WATERSHED LOCATED TO THE WEST OF THE L. A. RIVER IS ONE. AREA WITH SEVERAL COMMUNITIES IN NEED. AND INCLUDES CAR ST STE- PORTIONS OF COMPTON GARDENA HAWTHORNE LONG BEACH- YOU KNOW INGLEWOOD AT SUCH A- ALSO INCLUDING PORTIONS OF INGLEWOOD AND YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES- THIS IS AN AREA THAT'S THAT'S HEAVILY DEVELOPED IT'S ALSO SEVERELY AXES THAT LACKING IN PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE OPEN SPACE. IN ANOTHER AREA OF NEED VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF PLACES CATALINA ISLAND CERTAINLY NOT NEED MORE OPEN SPACE BY THE ACCESS TO THAT OPEN SPACE CAN CERTAINLY PROVE PROVE- SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE AND THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF FUN A RESOURCE CHALLENGES. NOW IT SAID THE ISLAND'S DEPENDENCE ON THE TOURISM INDUSTRY IS REALLY LEFT IT UNABLE TO FIND LONG TERM OPEN SPACE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN THE WAKE OF THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. SO THIS CONSERVANCY IS IN THE NEW PLACE UNIQUE POSITION TO HELP THESE AREAS ACTIVE SPEND THEIR MISSION. OF PRESERVING. OUR NATURAL RESOURCES IN A WAY THAT WE CAN ALL ENJOY AND THIS BILL WOULD- THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO EXACTLY THAT BY EXPANDING THEIR TERRITORY TO COVER THESE AREAS AND SO. I KNOW I HAD TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS. SALLY ANN GARCIA FROM THE RIVERS AMOUNTS CONSERVANCY. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT- I SEE THAT WE HAVE LET'S SEE. TO LEAD TO WITNESSES- YOU MAY NOT HAVE ANY LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I DON'T SEE ANY. I'M SORRY YES MISS GARCIA WITH SAN GABRIEL. MR GARCIA A SINK APRIL LOWER L. A.

AND THE LOWER HALF OF THE L. A. RIVER STARTING AND THE CITY OF RUNNING TO THE PORT OF LONG BEACH OUR PREPARATORY FIRES OF JUST OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE MILE EIGHTY FIVE EIGHT WHAT AT A PRACTICE TWO HUNDRED SEVEN SQUARE MILES WHAT. TERRITORY. BOTH HAVE A I'LL IS THE BEING OF CHANNEL OF SAID SHARE. OF THE CAR. OF THE LATE. COMMUNITIES ANY. THAT EXISTS WITHIN A CONSERVATIVE CURRENT. THE AREA BUT THE NAY. IS HEAVILY URBANIZED BY RELATIVELY COMPLICATED DEVELOPMENT. THE RESIDENTS ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE LACK OF A LITTLE DEVELOPMENT OF GREEN AND OPEN SPACES. DIFFICULT PART PARTY BELIEVES DESERVE ACTION IS NO DIFFERENT THAN A COMMUNITY WITH THE CONSERVANCY CURLY COMPRISES RESOURCES. INCLUDING FUNDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE EXPANSION WOULD INCLUDE OF ANGLE AN AREA THAT HAVE AN AVERAGE OF POINT EIGHT ACRES OF PARKS PAVE PER ONE THOUSAND RESIDENTS. AND AREA- THIRTY NINE APARTMENT 39% OF THE POPULATION LIVE BELOW TWO TIMES THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AND ONE POINT FIVE ACRES ONE THOUSAND RESIDENTS INDICATE WITH CITIES WITH LESS THAN POINT FOUR ACRES. NO ONE OFF OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT ELEMENTS OF THE CITY OF AVALON GENERAL PLAN. WHICH INCLUDES ACTION INCREASE PUBLIC RECREATION AS WELL AS IMPROVING ACCESS TO DOCUMENT OPEN SPACE AREA AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE WATERSHED AREA. HAT AB FOR ME LEAVE THEM FIFTEEN OTHER CITIES COMMITTEE UNINCORPORATED AREA. WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES ACT OF MILLIONS OF BONTA ON IT PROGRAM DOLLARS BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PRIVY TO. DOLLARS ARE MEANT TO BE INDUCTED INTO THE CONVENIENCE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO ENJOY OPEN SPACE. DEVOTED PUBLIC ACCIDENT PREVENT AND HABITAT CONSERVATION PROJECT. SUPPORT YOUTH TRAINING PROGRAMS. AND PROJECTS ARE IN LINE WITH EXECUTIVE ORDERS. NINE EIGHTY TO EIGHTY AND SO ON. THE BILL WHAT THE SUPPORT INCLUDE PART OF THE- AND GO PRIVILEGE. BUDGET PROP SIXTY EIGHT. THE BILL WOULD ALLOW THE CONSERVANCY TO MAXIMIZE THE- GRAPH TO MULTI RECIPIENTS WELL THE WATERSHED THEM L. A. RIVER. DURING YOUR WEBER BUT THE MAKE UP CHANNEL OF COURSE KIND OF AND I. BAKER OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW AND EXPANDED ACCESS BUT MAKING STATE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO ELIGIBLE PROJECTS. PRODUCT WITH BIRD JOB ECONOMIC GROWTH ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF CONSERVATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THAT'S GOOD BILL ISN'T JUST ABOUT MAKING THE CONSERVATIVE TERRITORY BIGGER ANY PUTTING STATE INVESTMENT BACK INTO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. ESPECIALLY SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU SOME ADVOCATES SAID- WE SHOULD PROTECT YOU SO MUCH- MISTER SEA APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY DO WE HAVE ANY OTHERS ON THE LINE.

NAME AFFILIATION SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR KNOWN AS QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME. OKAY VERY GOOD WE WILL THEN TURN TO OPPOSITION I DON'T SEE ANY OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM OR TO REMOTE HEARING ROOMS. I DO WANNA CHECK THE LINES MODERATOR JUST TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINES WE HAVE NONE LISTED IN COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN MR SURE NO ONE IS QUEUING UP. OKAY I WILL BRING BACK TO DIE CENTER EARLIER YEAH I HAD A QUESTION OR TWO AND IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THE WITNESS RATHER THAN. THEN PUT MISTER ALLEN ON SPOT OKAY IT IS THE RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY PERSON STILL ON THE PHONE. IT'S GARCIA YOU STILL WITH US. THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE IS. THERE'S A PLANNING PROCESS IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE A WHILE FOR THE LOS ANGELES RIVER IN THE LOWER RIVER IS UNDER THE RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY WITH THE AREAS THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THIS ADDITION. B. HAVE THEY ALREADY BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS OR WOULD THEY BE THIS BRING THEM INTO THE L. A. RIVER PROCESS FOR THE FIRST TIME. OKAY ACTUALLY WE- AFTER ALLEN HAD STATED WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS ARE OVER TWENTY YEARS- SO IT'S TIME TO UPDATE OUR OPEN SPACE PLAN WE ARE CURRENTLY UPDATING OUR OPEN SPACE PLAN ALSO KNOWN OF COMMON GROUND WITH INCOMES FROM OTHER CONSERVANCY DUE TO THE MULTI AGENCY EFFORT TO UPDATE WILL INCLUDE METROPOLITAN AREA DARK CURLY NOT PART OF OUR TERRITORY WHAT'S IN. THE UPDATE WILL REVIEW FUNDING ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO ECONOMIC NEEDS OF THE AREA WHICH INCLUDES THE EXPANSION THE EXPANDED AREA OF DIMMING OF CHANNEL AND CATALINA ISLAND. I THINK THAT WAS A YES BUT I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE. IT YEAH BIG BIG BECAUSE- THE ISSUE IS THERE'S AN ELABORATE PLANNING PROCESS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO SENATOR STERN'S DISTRICT. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THE LOWER PART OF THE RIVER WAS INVOLVED AND GOT OUT AHEAD OF THE PLANNING AND SO. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF. IF THE AREAS ADDED WERE INVOLVED AND I THINK YOU'RE SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IF THEY WEREN'T INVOLVED ALREADY. THE COULD SECOND QUESTION I HAD IS I HAVE A VAGUE RECOLLECTION THAT THERE WAS A PRIVATE CONSERVANCY THAT EXISTED FOR THE CAMERA WE CATALINA ISLAND OR OUT THERE. IS THIS COORDINATING WITH THAT PRIVATE CONSERVANCY IS IT SUBSUMING IT IS THERE SOME RESOURCES THEY BRING TO THE TABLE IT MIGHT COME TO RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS IF THIS. IF THIS BILL PASSES. VERY GOOD QUESTION WE HAVE ACTUALLY MET WITH THE CITY AVALON AS WELL THE CATALINA CONSERVANCY. THE CATALINA CONSERVANCY IS A NONPROFIT THAT IS NOT A STATE AGENCY. SO WHAT THIS EFFORT WITH OF EXPANSION WE'D BE ABLE TO. ASSIST EACH OTHER- ON EITHER EXPANDING OR REVITALIZING THEIR HABITAT ON THAT ISLAND. AND THEN WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST TO THE AUTHOR- IS DEAD HE ACTUALLY BE EXPLICIT ABOUT WHAT COORDINATION IS GOING TO BE SO THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T PASS AND THE NEXT THING WE KNOW THERE'S SOME NEGOTIATION GOING ON THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED AT THE TIME WE WERE DOING THE BILL SO I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT THE AUTHORS. HAVE THOSE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS AND CLARIFY THAT BEFORE THE BILL'S DONE A WITH THAT. A MISTER CHAIR OUT THERE'S A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS THERE BROKE WITH THAT I'LL BE READY TO MOVE THE BILL WHENEVER BUT DISCUSSION IS. DONE GREAT. GREAT THANK YOU- AND JUST TO CLARIFY- THE DOMINGUEZ CHANNEL IS NOT A PART OF THE L. A. RIVER IT'S WEST OF THE RIVER THERE IS A TRIBUTE TO THERE IS A- PROBLEM LET ME TELL YOU. MAY TELL YOU THAT FIRST BILL THAT THAT PASSED DIDN'T INCLUDE TRIBUTARIES AND THEN I HAD A NUMBER OF SENATORS SOME OF WHICH I AM SERVING WITH NOW. LAND ON ME TO MAKE SURE THAT TRIBUTARIES WERE ADDED TO THE BILL AND SO EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT JUST BE A TRIBUTARY IT'S LIKE I'M TRYING TO PRESUPPOSE THE CONFLICT BEFORE. IT LANDS ON SOME BUT YET I'M JUST NOT SURE IT'S A TRIBUTARY I WOULD LOVE TO GET WELL WE'LL LET WE'LL LET THEM CLARIFY THAT OVERTIME. I THINK I'VE RAISED THAT ISSUE WITH THE OTHER ISSUE IN THE AUTHOR CAN. FIGURE OUT IF THOSE ISSUES AND DEAL WITH I KNOW THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IMPACTED ARE CERTAINLY. INVOLVED WITH THE BILL SUPPORTING THE BILL WORKING WITH THE CONSERVANCY IN THE AUTHOR BUT AND- I DON'T KNOW THAT I KNOW. AREN'T I KNOW SUPPORT THE BILL YEAH IT'S HOW DIFFERENT RAISES AN ISSUE THAT'S ON THE DRESS THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THAT'S ALL YEP. YEP GOOD POINT. ALL RIGHT SO WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THAT ISSUE GOING FORWARD AND- IT SHOULD THE AUTHOR WANT TO MAKE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS. ANY L. A. RIVER PLANNING- COMMITTEE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT- BUT FOR NOW WE HAVE THIS BILL BEFORE US HERE TODAY. WHICH AT SANTA CATALINA ISLAND AND THE DIMMING IS CHANNEL WATERSHED TO- THIS CONSERVANCY THERE'S A MOTION FROM CENTER LATER DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MISTER. PROXY AUTHOR WOULD YOU. PLEASE CLOSE HERE RECEIVE THE DISCUSSION- THAT WILL CERTAINLY. HELP TO FACILITATE- FIVE GIVEN THE ANSWERS THAT THAT- CENTER LAYERED CORRECTLY RAISES AND RESPECT S.
