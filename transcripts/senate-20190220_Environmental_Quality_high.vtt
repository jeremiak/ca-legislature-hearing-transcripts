THERE IS --

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:54.747
EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRICITY

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:56.382
THAT'S BEEN THE BIGGEST DRIVER

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:59.418

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:42.361
TO MEET THAT TWENTY THIRTY GOAL

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:44.029
ARE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY ONE

00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:45.564
MILLION METRIC TONS.

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:48.300
OF THE BIGGEST POLICIES THAT IT

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:50.069
HIGHLIGHTS TO HELP HELP ACHIEVE

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:51.537
THOSE REDUCTIONS ARE CAP AND

AT 35%.

00:12:57.576 --> 00:12:58.577
AND THEN --

ARE.

00:13:06.685 --> 00:13:08.254
A LITTLE BIT SMALLER PERCENTAGE

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.721
OF KIND OF THE OVERALL

00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:10.623
CUMULATIVE MISSION REDUCTIONS --

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:12.057
THAT IT FORECAST WOULD BE NEEDED

DOING HIGHLIGHT JUST A COUPLE

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:17.396
THINGS.

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.098
THE ANALYSIS DONE BY CAR DOES

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:20.699
FOCUS ON CUMULATIVE EMISSIONS SO

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:22.168
IT'S KIND OF THE OVERALL

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:24.470
AGGREGATE EMISSIONS.

YEAR OVER YEAR --

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:30.376
AND THE FOCUS ON IN THAT

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:32.711
ANALYSIS IS NOT EXPLICITLY ON

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:34.813

SCIENTIFIC BASIS AND AND HAVE AN

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:44.657
INTEREST IN FOCUSING ON Q.

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:46.225
MOTIVE EMISSIONS GIVEN THE

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:49.461
TO STAY IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND SO

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:52.398
THERE'S THERE'S ABOUT COMMITTED

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:54.500
EMISSIONS OVER TIME WE JUST

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:55.334
WANNA SORT OF HIGHLIGHT THAT

ANNUAL TERMS AS WE WILL GET TO

00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:02.608
IN A LITTLE BIT ON NOT CREATES A

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.376
BIT OF ATTENTION AND KIND.

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:05.411
OF HOW THE PROGRAM IS SET UP

00:14:05.477 --> 00:14:06.512
PARTICULARLY CAP AND TRADE

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:07.413
PROGRAM IN THE DEGREE TO WHICH

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:10.349
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY CHIEF THAT

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:13.085
ANNUAL TARGET AND TWENTY THIRTY

00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:14.053

IT'S SORT OF A HIGHLIGHTED AS

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:23.062
KIND OF THE THE BACKSTOP FOR THE

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:24.663
THE THE TOOL IT'S GOING TO MAKE

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.665
SURE WHERE OTHER POLICIES.

00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:27.967
AREN'T ACHIEVING --

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:30.169

SOME REPORTS THAT WE'VE ISSUED

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:47.286
AND HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE KEY

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:48.220
TAKEAWAYS --

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:49.488
FIRST --

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:50.055
JUST KIND OF ON THE OVERALL

00:14:50.122 --> 00:14:53.259
EFFECTS OF THE HE'S JUST --

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:55.361
BY WAY OF BACKGROUND.

00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:56.262
AB THREE NINETY EIGHT THE BILL

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:57.896
THAT EXTENDED THE CAP AND TRADE

00:14:57.963 --> 00:14:59.064
PROGRAM IN.

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:00.566
TWENTY SEVENTEEN ESTABLISHED A

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:01.900
REQUIREMENT FOR OUR OFFICE.

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:03.435
TO ANNUALLY ASSESS THE ECONOMIC

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:05.504
IMPACTS AND BENEFITS OF THE

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.773
STATE'S CLIMATE POLICIES AND GHG

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.208
TARGETS.

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:11.176
AND SO THIS DECEMBER LAST

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:13.312
DECEMBER WE ISSUED A COUPLE

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:14.013
REPORTS --

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.314
ONE OF THEM WAS JUST KIND OF

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:16.649
PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:20.219
GENERAL TYPES OF A FAX.

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:22.021
THAT STATE CLIMATE POLICIES HAVE

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:23.389
AND SO THAT'S VERY COMPILER WILL

00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:25.391
IN GENERAL DISCUSSION.

00:15:25.457 --> 00:15:28.460
OF THE THE TYPES OF TEXAS STATE

00:15:28.527 --> 00:15:29.495
POLICIES --

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:31.430
AND WHAT WE COULD CUT SEE ABOUT

00:15:31.497 --> 00:15:32.031
NEAR THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.432
AFFECTS SOME OF THE KEY

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.234
TAKEAWAYS ARE ARE REALLY I THINK

00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:36.835
THAT THE OVERALL EFFECTS OF

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:38.170
STATE CON A PIECE.

00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:40.272
ON A POLICY SO FAR UNCLEAR --

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:41.573
AND THAT'S FOR A VARIETY OF

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.442
REASONS --

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:44.643
ONE IS THAT JUST THE POLICIES

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.045
HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF AFFECTS

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:47.846
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BENEFITS

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:49.782
ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCING

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:51.583
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS --

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.285
THERE ARE --

00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:56.922
REDUCTIONS DIED SIGNIFICANT

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:58.123
BENEFITS AS WELL.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.692
THERE'S A VARIETY OF COSTS

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:01.126
INCLUDING KIND OF DIRECT

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:03.128
FINANCIAL COSTS MAYBE IN A MORE

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:04.430
EXPENSIVE SOURCE OF ENERGY AND

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:05.364
SO THERE'S KIND OF A DIRECT HIRE

00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:07.099
FINANCIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:08.300
PROVIDING THAT.

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:09.335
AS WELL AS MORE CAN KIND OF

00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:11.937
IMPLICIT OR INDIRECT COSTS SAID

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:13.372
FOR EXAMPLE IF --

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:15.307
ENERGY IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.543
MAYBE HOUSEHOLDS WILL ADJUST THE

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:20.312
THERMOSTAT OR ON THEIR H. BACK A

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:21.146
LITTLE BIT LASSEN SO THERE'S

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:22.881
SORT OF A A CHANGE IN SORT OF

00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:24.383
COMFORT --

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.751
BENEFIT THAT SOMEONE MIGHT GET

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:26.719
FROM THAT TO LIVE JUST OF A WIDE

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:28.187
VARIETY OF AFFECTS THAT ARE

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:29.655
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE POLICIES.

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:33.192
ARE OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:35.494
ESTIMATE --

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:37.496
AND THAT GETS TO OF THE LAST

00:16:37.563 --> 00:16:39.164
SECTION HONEST ON PAGE SIX IS

00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:40.299
THE KEY CHALLENGES AN ESTIMATE

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:41.467
IN THOSE POLICY AFFECTS.

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:42.201
OTHERS A WIDE VARIETY OF THEM

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:43.869
AND THEN TRYING TO TEASE OUT.

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:45.104
WHAT THE SPECIFIC AFFECT OF A

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.139
PARTICULAR POLICY A PARTICULAR

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:48.273
GROUP OF POLICIES IS

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.575
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT?

00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:51.176
GIVEN THE CHANGES AND OTHER

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:52.644
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGES

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:53.645
ANOTHER TECHNOLOGICAL

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:56.615
ADVANCEMENTS SOME OF WHICH ARE

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:59.051
UNRELATED TO THE STATE'S KIND OF

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:00.452
POLICIES THEMSELVES AND SO SIR

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.821
TRYING TO TEASE ALL THOSE OUT AS

00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:06.125
A AS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING.

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:07.259
ON PAGE SEVEN WE TALK ABOUT TO

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:07.926
SOME OTHER CHALLENGES IN TRYING

00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:09.094
TO KIND OF COME UP WITH A NUMBER

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:10.496
ON KIND OF WHAT THE OVERALL

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:12.464
ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE POLICIES

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:13.532
ARE --

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.034
INCLUDING TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:17.636
A IMPACTS ON EMISSIONS IN OTHER

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.538
JURISDICTIONS --

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:20.272
AND EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:23.876
AND AS WELL AS CONSIDERING SOME

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:25.644
OF THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:26.745
DIFFERENT STATE POLICIES AND

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:32.217
OTHER FEDERAL POLICIES.

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:36.355
I'M GONNA MOVE ON TO PAGE --

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:38.090
EIGHT SOME COMMENTS ON THE CAP

00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:40.459
AND TRADE PROGRAM A COUPLE OF

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:42.261
LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO WE

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:43.495
ISSUED A REPORT --

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:44.696
HIGHLIGHTING SOME ISSUES FOR

00:17:44.763 --> 00:17:45.964
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT ON

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:47.633
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CAP AND

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:49.001
TRADE PROGRAM --

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:50.436
DOING A STATE UP FRONT --

00:17:50.502 --> 00:17:52.137
AS AN OFFICE WE THINK OF ECONOMY

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:53.672
WIDE PRICING POLICY LIGHT

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.274
CONCENTRATE IS THE MOST COST

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.209
EFFECTIVE POLICY TO REDUCE

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:58.811
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

00:17:58.877 --> 00:18:00.112
GIVEN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT --

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:01.146
POTENTIAL EFFECTS AND COSTS

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:02.614
ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT

00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:04.416
POLICIES AND THE DIFFICULTY IN

00:18:04.483 --> 00:18:06.051
ESTIMATING THOSE WE THINK

00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:07.519
THERE'S JUST A LOT OF VALUE AND

00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:09.288
A PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY AND

00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:10.923
PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE TO

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:11.790
DIFFERENT BUSINESSES AND

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:13.659
HOUSEHOLDS TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:14.026
ARE.

00:18:14.092 --> 00:18:15.360
WITH COSTLY TO THEM AND SO

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:17.095
RELYING ON A KIND OF FLEXIBLE

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:19.264
ECONOMY WIDE MARKET PRICES

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:20.466
PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AND WE

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:20.999
THINK IT'S THE MOST COST

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:23.569
EFFECTIVE STRATEGY AND IN MOST

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:26.338
CASES -- BUT

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:27.739
THAT SAID --

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:28.640
AND ARGUE CAP AND TRADE LIKELY

00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:30.409
IS NOT PLAYED A PRIMARY ROLE IN

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:33.078
EMISSION REDUCTIONS SO FAR --

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:35.380
THE PRICES HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:36.582
LOW AND NOW THEY HAVE HAD AN

00:18:36.648 --> 00:18:39.051
EFFECT YOU DO STILL HAVE A PRICE

00:18:39.117 --> 00:18:39.685
ON A MISSION SO I DO THINK THEY

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:41.053
ARE HAVING AN EFFECT BUT THE

00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:43.755
PRICE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LOW --

00:18:43.822 --> 00:18:44.323
BECAUSE EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:48.260
BELOW THAT OF THE PROGRAM --

00:18:48.327 --> 00:18:49.628
OTHER FACTORS LIKE ECONOMIC

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:51.263
CONDITIONS TECHNOLOGICAL

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.532
ADVANCEMENTS ANOTHER ON THE

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:54.299
POLICIES OF THE STATE IS

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:56.001
IMPLEMENTED ARE.

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:57.903
LIKELY --

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.471
MAJOR DRIVERS AND COST EMISSIONS

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:00.739
TO REMAIN BELOW CAPS FROM

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:02.274
EXACTLY WHICH ONE OF THOSE

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:03.675
FACTORS IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:04.910
SAY BUT THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.345
OF FACTORS THAT --

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:07.880
ARE LIKELY DRIVING --

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:10.048
HAVE HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:13.418
DOWNWARD TREND IN EMISSIONS --

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:15.687
THE DETAILS OF THE POST TWENTY

00:19:15.754 --> 00:19:16.121
TWENTY CONCENTRATE

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:17.122
IMPLEMENTATION --

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:19.191
WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS --

00:19:19.258 --> 00:19:21.360
SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE

00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:23.128
OVERALL EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAM.

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:24.863
AND SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE NINE

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.298
WE HIGHLIGHT SOME KIND OF KEY

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:27.132
ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.768
CONSIDERATION AND OVERSIGHT --

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:31.103
MANY OF THE KEY IMPLEMENTATION

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:33.338
DECISIONS HAVE A KEY TRADE OFFS

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:34.873
JUST BETWEEN COSTS AND EMISSION

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.408
REDUCTIONS OR EMISSIONS

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:37.175
CERTAINTY.

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:37.743
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:39.378
BALANCE THAT --

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:41.280
THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND CARBON --

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:42.548
WILL HAVE TO STRIKE IN A LOT OF

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:44.349
THESE DECISIONS.

00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:46.485
I'M JUST GONNA HIGHLIGHT TWO OF

00:19:46.552 --> 00:19:48.387
THEM IN THE SECOND BULLET.

00:19:48.453 --> 00:19:50.022
I'LL WE DISCUSS MANAGING

00:19:50.088 --> 00:19:50.956
ALLOWANCE PRESENCE CERTAINTY.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:54.793
SO GIVEN THE MORE STRANGE --

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.395
FUTURE PRICES ALTHOUGH THEY'RE

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:57.763
SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY.

00:19:57.829 --> 00:19:58.864
NAME MIGHT HAVE TO INCREASE

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:00.232
SUBSTANTIALLY IN ORDER TO

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.466
ENCOURAGE ADOPTIONS THAT ARE

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:03.669
NEEDED TO MEET THE STATE'S.

00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:05.337
TWENTY THIRTY GOALS AND SO --

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:07.372
TRYING TO SORT OF AGAIN BALANCE --

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.608
THOSE HIGHER PRICES WITH THE

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:11.276
EMISSIONS AND CERTAINTY IS A KEY

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.945
CHALLENGE AND I THINK ONE

00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:13.645
QUESTION --

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:15.147
FOR THE LETTERS LEGISLATIVE

00:20:15.213 --> 00:20:17.349
OVERSIGHT FOR CAR BAR AND OF ARE

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.484
THE TOOLS FOR MANAGING ALLOWANCE

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:20.919
PRICES SUCH AS A PRICE FLOOR

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:22.354
PRICE CEILING.

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:23.655
AND SO CALLED SPEED BUMPS ARE

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:25.724
THEY SAID AT LEVELS THAT ARE

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:26.725
CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.026
LEGISLATURE BALANCES THOSE TRADE

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:29.795
OFFS BETWEEN --

00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:31.163
WHAT WHAT THE OVERALL COSTS ARE

00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:32.464
AND CERTAINTY AROUND MEETING

00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:37.069
THOSE EMISSIONS TARGETS ND SO --

00:20:37.135 --> 00:20:38.470
THAT'S ONE ONE KEY AREA FOR

00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:39.838
OVERSIGHT THE SECOND ONE A

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.273
HIGHLIGHT AS IS THE FIRST BULLET

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.075
ON YOUR PAGE --

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:45.444
IS SENDING THE EMISSIONS CAPS

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.279
AND THE KEY QUESTION AND OUR

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:48.347
VIEWERS ARE THE PROGRAM CAPS AT

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:50.315
A LEVEL THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:54.453
THE STATUTORY TWENTY THIRTY

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:57.623
ANNUAL TARGET TEN OUT THIS IS

00:20:57.689 --> 00:21:00.092
JUST KIND OF A GRAPHICAL

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:02.160
ILLUSTRATION OF OF I THINK SORT

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:03.695
OF ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS HERE.

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:05.430
IS JUST THIS QUESTION AROUND

00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:07.165
WHETHER A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:21:07.232 --> 00:21:08.233
THANKED ALLOWANCES IN THE CAP

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.901
AND TRADE PROGRAM INCREASES THE

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:13.438
RISK OF EXCEEDING THE STATE'S

00:21:13.505 --> 00:21:14.339
ANNUAL TWENTY THIRTY TARGET.

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:15.307
SO JUST TO KIND OF WALK YOU

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:17.843
THROUGH THIS FIGURE THE THE MORE

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:18.777
STEEP LINE --

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:20.145
WHAT'S GONNA STARTS OUT AT THE

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:21.413
TOP OF THE LEFT AND THEN --

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.749
GOES DOWN TO MEET THE TWENTY

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:24.650
THIRTY TARGET --

00:21:24.716 --> 00:21:26.451
THOSE ARE KIND OF THE THE ANNUAL

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:28.920
PROGRAM CAPS. FOR THE CAP AND

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:30.022
TRADE PROGRAM.

00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:31.990
THE SHALLOW LINE THAT IS KIND OF

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:34.059
A AN EXAMPLE EMISSIONS SCENARIO

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:35.060
WHERE EMISSIONS ARE STILL

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:37.029
DECLINING AND IN THE FIRST

00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:38.130
SEVERAL YEARS OF THE PROGRAM

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:39.631
EMISSIONS THE GOOD THING THAT

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:40.866
EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN BELOW THE

00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:42.567
CAPS BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT.

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:45.604
THERE'S A KIND OF BANK OF

00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:48.407
ALLOWANCES THEY'RE BUILT UP THAT

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:48.874
YEARS.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.308
AND SO --

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:50.909
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN GET

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:52.678
OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY IF THERE'S

00:21:52.744 --> 00:21:54.079
A LARGE BANK OF ALLOWANCES THAT

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.348
CAN THEN BE USED IN LATER YEARS

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:56.548
THEN.

00:21:56.615 --> 00:21:58.150
YOU CAN MEET OUR SORT OF OVERALL

00:21:58.216 --> 00:21:59.418
CUMULATIVE.

00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:00.719
EMISSIONS GOALS SET OUT BY THE

00:22:00.786 --> 00:22:02.621
PROGRAM BUT WHEN HE REACHED

00:22:02.688 --> 00:22:03.188
TWENTY THIRTY YOUR ANNUAL

00:22:03.255 --> 00:22:05.057
EMISSIONS MIGHT NOT BE ON THE

00:22:05.123 --> 00:22:06.792
TRAJECTORY THAT YOU WANT --

00:22:06.858 --> 00:22:07.492
AND AND THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED IN

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:10.128
YOUR SB THIRTY TWO TARGETS.

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:11.663
SO THAT'S KIND OF A WE THINK A

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.398
KEY QUESTION. FOR CARBON AND

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:14.399
JUST FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:16.001
CONSIDER IS IS THE PROGRAM SET

00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:17.302
UP IN A WAY.

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:19.638
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:22.240
TWENTY THIRTY TARGET AND THE

00:22:22.307 --> 00:22:24.476
LEVEL OF AMBITION ABOUT TARGET.

00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:26.611
SO -- PAGE

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.213
ELEVEN MOVE THROUGH THERE'S NO

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.014
WE HAVEN'T WE ISSUED ANOTHER

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:30.148
REPORT FOCUSING MORE

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:32.451
SPECIFICALLY ON THE STATE'S

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:34.453
TRANSPORTATION POLICIES.

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:37.122
ON THE CHART ON PAGE ELEVEN

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.256
GIVES YOU A SENSE OF JUST THE

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:39.458
WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:41.359
TRANSPORTATION RELATED SPECIFIC

00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:43.395
YET SHE POLICIES THAT THE STATE

00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:43.595
HAS.

00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:44.529
INCLUDING LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:47.733
PROGRAMS REGULATIONS INCENTIVES --

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:49.301
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:22:49.367 --> 00:22:53.105
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE VOUCHERS FOR

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:54.639
A CLEANER HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AS

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:56.641
WELL AS PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATION

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:58.110
PROGRAMS.

00:22:58.176 --> 00:22:59.511
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:00.846
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED SO I WILL

00:23:00.912 --> 00:23:02.013
GO THROUGH THOSE IN DETAIL BUT

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.448
JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:06.485
THE RANGE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.

00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:09.287
PAGE TWELVE OF THE HAND OUT --

00:23:09.354 --> 00:23:10.555
JUST SUMMARIZES SOME OF OUR KEY

00:23:10.622 --> 00:23:13.125
TAKE AWAYS AFTER HAVING REVIEWED

00:23:13.191 --> 00:23:14.426
THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION OF

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:15.694
LITERATURE ON ALL THOSE

00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:16.895
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE

00:23:16.962 --> 00:23:18.430
KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THOSE

00:23:18.497 --> 00:23:19.397
PROGRAMS.

00:23:19.464 --> 00:23:20.665
AGAIN THE OVERALL MAGNITUDE OF

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:23.368
THE EFFECTS ARE LARGELY ON CLEAR

00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:24.703
THERE ARE CLEARLY SOME BENEFIT

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:25.737
SOME SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS

00:23:25.804 --> 00:23:27.506
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAMS AS

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:29.875
pSISTER TRYING TO PINPOINT WHAT

00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:32.310
THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE ARE IT IS

00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:33.078
DIFFICULT FOR A LOT OF THE

00:23:33.145 --> 00:23:34.179
REASONS THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:36.381
TRYING TO SORT OF TEASE OUT.

00:23:36.448 --> 00:23:37.749
THE EFFECTS OF THESE PROGRAMS.

00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:39.384
RELATIVE TO OTHER ECONOMIC

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:40.685
CONDITIONS CHANGES IN GASOLINE

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:43.054
PRICES AND OTHER FACTORS.

00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:45.757
IS DIFFICULT --

00:23:45.824 --> 00:23:47.425
THERE'RE.

00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:49.060
WORSE SOME MORE SORT OF

00:23:49.127 --> 00:23:50.595
PROSPECTIVE ANALYSES TRYING TO

00:23:50.662 --> 00:23:51.863
SORT OF FORECAST WHAT THE

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.632
EFFECTS OF THESE PLICIES WILL

00:23:53.698 --> 00:23:55.100
BE ONCE ARE IMPLEMENTED.

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:56.501
I TINK ONE GAP THAT WE

00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:57.836
IDENTIFIED AS THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:23:57.903 --> 00:24:00.405
MANY ESTIMATES OF ACTUAL PROGRAM

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:01.940
AFFECTS AFTER THEIR IMPLEMENTED

00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:04.042
AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:06.178
BUT WE SEE THAT THIS AS ONE OF

00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:07.512
SIGNIFICANT GAP IN KIND OF THE

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:08.847
OF STATE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:09.815
WHAT WHAT HAVE THE EFFECTS.

00:24:09.881 --> 00:24:11.349
OF THESE POLICIES BEEN WHAT'S

00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:13.552
EFFECTIVE OTHERS RELATIVELY

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:14.586
LIMITED NUMBER OF TRYING TO KIND

00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:16.254
OF RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSES

00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:18.356
LOOKING BACK ON ON WHAT HAS THE

00:24:18.423 --> 00:24:19.958
PROGRAM ACHIEVED --

00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:21.393
AND THOSE ARE DIFFICULT AND

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:22.627
SOMETIMES CAN REQUIRE YOU KNOW

00:24:22.694 --> 00:24:23.695
VERY ADVANCE TO TO SINGLE

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:25.664
TECHNIQUES OR MAYBE ON IN THE

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.399
EARLY STAGES OF PROGRAM

00:24:27.465 --> 00:24:28.567
EXPANSION OR DEVELOPMENT TRYING

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:29.868
TO SORT OF SET UP THE PROGRAM AS

00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:32.404
AS A PILOT AND TRYING TO SORT OF

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.272
SET UP THAT WAY TO TRY. TO

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:38.510
EVALUATE THE PRO EXCUSE ME.

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:41.213
OF THE LARGE NUMBER POLICIES --

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:42.614
TARGETING TRANSPORTATION

00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:44.115
EMISSIONS CREATES A VARIETY OF

00:24:44.182 --> 00:24:45.851
OF CHALLENGES INCLUDING JUST

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:46.651
CHALLENGES TRYING TO ESTIMATE

00:24:46.718 --> 00:24:48.086
THE EFFECT OF EACH PARTICULAR

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:49.955
PROGRAM --

00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:50.956
AND POTENTIAL LACK OF

00:24:51.022 --> 00:24:52.390
COORDINATION BETWEEN --

00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:55.126
DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT OPERATE

00:24:55.193 --> 00:24:57.729
A SIMILAR TYPES OF PROGRAMS.

00:24:57.796 --> 00:25:00.565
HOLDON MOVE ON QUICKLY --

00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:04.302
FINALLY ON PAGE --

00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:05.971
THIRTEEN THE THERE'S NOT ALWAYS

00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:08.240
GREAT EVIDENCE ON THE COSTS AND

00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:09.507
BENEFITS OF EACH PROGRAM BUT

00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:12.444
BASED ON THE THE EVIDENCE THAT

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.012
WE DID FIND ON THE COSTS OF

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:16.214
REDUCING THE A TON OF GREENHOUSE

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:18.283
GAS EMISSIONS IN EACH PROGRAM --

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.651
MANY OF THE POLICIES OR SOME OF

00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:20.518
THE POLICIES ARE RELATIVELY

00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:22.320
COSTLY WAYS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE

00:25:22.387 --> 00:25:24.222
GAS EMISSIONS --

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:25.857
RELATIVE TO FOR EXAMPLE A CAP

00:25:25.924 --> 00:25:27.626
AND TRADE PROGRAM --

00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:28.793
HOWEVER IT CAN THEY COULD BE

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.362
VALUABLE ANOTHER --

00:25:30.428 --> 00:25:32.664
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE --

00:25:32.731 --> 00:25:34.499
SOME OF THE POLICIES COULD BE

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:36.434
VALUABLE AND KIND OF PROMOTING

00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:37.369
ACTIVITIES THAT MAY BE A CARBON

00:25:37.435 --> 00:25:40.438
PRICE ON ITS OWN EXAMPLE --

00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:41.239
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:43.241
ACTIVITIES PARTICULARLY EARLIER

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:44.009
STAGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

00:25:44.075 --> 00:25:45.677
ACTIVITIES OR PILOTS AND

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:47.612
DEMONSTRATIONS.

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:49.147
EVEN WITH A CARBON PRICE THERE

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:50.448
MAY NOT BE SORT OF AN ADEQUATE

00:25:50.515 --> 00:25:51.716
INCENTIVE AND PRIVATE.

00:25:51.783 --> 00:25:53.451
PRIVATE ENTITIES MAY NOT INVEST

00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:54.853
IN THOSE THINGS AND SO THERE MAY

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.621
BE A ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT.

00:25:56.688 --> 00:25:57.589
TO KIND OF PROMOTE ADDITIONAL

00:25:57.656 --> 00:25:59.190
INVESTMENT AND THOSE TYPES OF

00:25:59.257 --> 00:26:01.459
KIND OF ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:02.027
INNOVATION AND RESEARCH AND

00:26:02.093 --> 00:26:03.161
DEVELOPMENT --

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:04.796
OTHER AREAS ARE CO POLLUTANTS

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.331
AGAIN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS

00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:08.300
THAT SHE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS.

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:11.436
IN REDUCING POLLUTANTS AND SO --

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:12.370
YOU KNOW I HAD TO EXTENT

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:13.772
PROGRAMS ARE SIR TARGETED AT

00:26:13.838 --> 00:26:16.341
THOSE THOSE BENEFITS THEY THEY

00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:19.177
MIGHT BE VALUABLE --

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:22.414
IN THAT REGARD.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.115
FINALLY PAGE --

00:26:24.182 --> 00:26:25.583
FOURTEEN JUST SOME HIGH LEVEL --

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.818
ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:29.354
CONSIDERATION AGAIN WE THINK

00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:30.889
USING RELYING ON A COMPANY WIDE

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:32.223
CARBON PRICING --

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.326
WOULD ACHIEVE LOW COST

00:26:34.392 --> 00:26:36.795
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION-REDUCTIONS I'LL AND COST

00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:37.662
EFFECTIVENESS IN OUR VIEW IS

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:39.597
INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS THE

00:26:39.664 --> 00:26:41.066
GOALS.

00:26:41.132 --> 00:26:42.167
BECOME MORE AMBITIOUS AND THE

00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:43.501
TARGETS BECOME MORE AMBITIOUS

00:26:43.568 --> 00:26:47.572
OUT -- TO

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:48.673
TWENTY THIRTY WERE WARY THINK

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.808
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD THINK

00:26:49.874 --> 00:26:50.909
ABOUT IMPLEMENTING COUPLE

00:26:50.976 --> 00:26:52.210
COMPLIMENTARY POLICIES AND BUT

00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:53.645
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:54.379
THEY'VE.

00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:56.514
IDENTIFIED A AN AREA WHERE

00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:57.716
CARBON PRICING DOESN'T

00:26:57.782 --> 00:27:00.285
ADEQUATELY SORT OF ENCOURAGE --

00:27:00.352 --> 00:27:01.252
COST EFFECTIVE EMISSION

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:04.055
REDUCTIONS --

00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:07.158
FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER --

00:27:07.225 --> 00:27:08.426
ONE OTHER ISSUE WE WANT TO

00:27:08.493 --> 00:27:09.995
HIGHLIGHT IS --

00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:11.896
AND ARGUE THERE SHOULD.

00:27:11.963 --> 00:27:13.131
LIKE WHAT IS THAT WOULD MEAN

00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:14.632
COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES WHAT SO

00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:15.767
YEAH SEVENTY YEAR.

00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:17.736
RIGHT SO I THINK.

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:20.338
THE WAY WE VIEW IT AS THINKING

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:22.207
ABOUT WHAT CARBON PRICING DOES

00:27:22.273 --> 00:27:24.342
AND WHAT IT DOESN'T DO.

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:26.444
AND YOU KNOW CARBON PRICING CAN

00:27:26.511 --> 00:27:28.446
KIND OF ENCOURAGE --

00:27:28.513 --> 00:27:30.348
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES.

00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:32.317
TO REDUCE EMISSIONS ONE THING

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:33.151
THAT.

00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:33.785
A COMMUNIST WILL OFTEN POINT TO

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:37.055
THAT PRICING DOESN'T DO FOR

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:39.090
EXAMPLE IS --

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:40.859
EVEN WITH A PRICE ON CARBON

00:27:40.925 --> 00:27:41.559
THERE MAY JUST BE AN UNDER

00:27:41.626 --> 00:27:42.961
INVESTMENT IN KIND OF NEW

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.429
TECHNOLOGIES AND RESEARCH AND

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:46.264
DEVELOPMENT --

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:47.465
THAT'S ONE I THINK COMMON

00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:49.000
EXAMPLE ON JUST BECAUSE SOME OF

00:27:49.067 --> 00:27:50.668
THE BENEFITS OF INVESTING.

00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:51.536
AND MORE RESEARCH AND

00:27:51.603 --> 00:27:52.670
DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION WILL

00:27:52.737 --> 00:27:54.672
SOMETIMES SPILL OVER TO OTHER

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:57.709
FIRMS OR AND SO --

00:27:57.776 --> 00:27:58.576
YOU KNOW THE PRIVATE SECTOR ON

00:27:58.643 --> 00:28:00.378
ITS OWN MIGHT TEND TO UNDER

00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:03.114
INVEST IN THOSE AREAS AND SO --

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.382
YOU KNOW THAT THE STATE'S SORT

00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:06.084
OF FOCUSING AND SOME OF IT'S A

00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:08.119
NON CARBON PRICING POLICIES ON

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:08.920
WAYS TO KIND OF PROMOTE THAT

00:28:08.987 --> 00:28:10.321
TYPE OF INNOVATION OR ADDITIONAL

00:28:10.388 --> 00:28:12.157
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT --

00:28:12.223 --> 00:28:13.191
IT'S KIND OF ONE WAY TO THINK

00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:14.626
ABOUT SORT OF YOU KNOW HOW.

00:28:14.692 --> 00:28:17.095
TO YOU KNOW HOW TO KIND OF WRAP

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:17.662
OTHER POLICIES AROUND CARBON

00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:19.064
PRICING --

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.031
THERE'S I THINK THERE'S ALSO

00:28:20.098 --> 00:28:21.132
ANOTHER --

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:23.668
ARGUMENT I THINK --

00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:24.736
FOR SOME FEELING AND

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:25.703
INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALSO MY

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.740
COMMENTS WILL POINT TO THE SUN.

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:29.574
KIND OF AFFECTS OF YOU KNOW YOU

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.209
NEED THE FILLING STATION OR THE

00:28:31.276 --> 00:28:32.577
CART WHICH ONE COMES FIRST SORT

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:33.778
OF THE THE FILLING STATION OR

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:35.780
THE VEHICLES AND THERE MIGHT BE

00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:37.515
A RATIONALE FOR GOING TO TRYING

00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:39.651
TO PROMOTE SERGEANT CHARGING FOR

00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:42.153
EXAMPLE YEAH --

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.621
BUT TRYING TO SORT OF IDENTIFY

00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:44.522
WE AWAY THOSE GAPS ARE AND WHAT

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:45.523
WHAT CARBON PRICING DOESN'T

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:46.157
ACHIEVE ON ITS OWN AND THEN

00:28:46.224 --> 00:28:47.392
TRYING TO SORT OF FIT THE

00:28:47.459 --> 00:28:48.793
POLICIES --

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.462
TO TO TO THOSE PARTICULAR GAPS.

00:28:50.528 --> 00:28:55.967
AND SO FOLKS IN POLICIES THAT

00:28:56.034 --> 00:28:57.235
ARE MOST LIKELY TO ENCOURAGE

00:28:57.302 --> 00:28:58.903
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS IN

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.305
OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO MAXIMIZE

00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:02.107
THE OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS

00:29:02.173 --> 00:29:03.108
BENEFITS --

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:04.209
I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:05.310
THE LEGISLATURE THINKS ABOUT

00:29:05.376 --> 00:29:06.544
THAT WE JUST WANTED.

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:07.278
TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IS

00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:08.780
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT --

00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:10.648
GIVEN THE CONTEXT OF CALIFORNIA

00:29:10.715 --> 00:29:12.183
BEING ABOUT 1% OF GLOBAL

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.086
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

00:29:15.153 --> 00:29:15.720
THAT LIKELY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:18.523
AFFECT HAVE IS ON THE DEGREE TO

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.292
WHICH IT ENCOURAGES EMISSION

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:22.293
REDUCTIONS IN OTHER

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.096
JURISDICTIONS AND SO --

00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:27.132
HOW TO DO THAT IS NOT ALWAYS AN

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:28.600
EASY QUESTION AND NOT ALWAYS AN

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.335
EASY QUESTION TO ANSWER --

00:29:30.401 --> 00:29:31.469
BUT MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER

00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:32.370
THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHICH

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:34.372
FOR EXAMPLE WHICH POLICIES ARE

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:35.373
LIKELY TO SERVE AS A

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.241
DEMONSTRATION FOR OTHER

00:29:36.307 --> 00:29:37.642
JURISDICTIONS WHICH ONES ARE

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:38.910
LIKELY TO BE.

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:40.178
ADOPTED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS

00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:42.413
AND KIND OF FOCUS ON ON THOSE AS

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.415
MUCH AS POSSIBLE --

00:29:44.482 --> 00:29:45.984
AS WELL AS POLICIES AGAIN.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.719
THAT MIGHT PROMOTE TECHNOLOGICAL

00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:49.387
ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY THAT

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:50.955
CAN THEN BE USED IN OTHER

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:52.657
JURISDICTIONS AND THINKING ABOUT --

00:29:52.724 --> 00:29:53.391
WHICH POLICIES ARE MOST

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:55.293
EFFECTIVE AT DOING THAT AND

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.561
THEREFORE MIGHT HAVE THE SORT OF

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:58.129
SPILLOVER BENEFITS IN.

00:29:58.196 --> 00:30:01.032
AN AMBUSH AS EMISSION REDUCTIONS

00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:03.034
IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:04.135
AND FINALLY --

00:30:04.202 --> 00:30:05.436
ESTABLISHING A ROBUST SYSTEM TO

00:30:05.503 --> 00:30:06.538
EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF STATE

00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:08.106
CLIMATE POLICIES ITALKED A LOT

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:09.174
ABOUT I DON'T.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.309
KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW SO FAR --

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:12.810
SOME EXAMPLES THE LEGISLATURE

00:30:12.877 --> 00:30:13.711
MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:15.713
REQUIRING DEPARTMENTS TO CONDUCT

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.316
RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS AGAIN

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:20.652
OF IT OF ITS MAJOR POLICIES --

00:30:20.718 --> 00:30:22.687
FOR EXAMPLE IS COULD INCLUDE AS

00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:24.522
A PROGRAMS BEING ROLLED OUT

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:26.090
TRYING TO PLAN.

00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:27.892
FOR HOW HOW THAT PROGRAM WILL BE

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:30.762
EVALUATED --

00:30:30.828 --> 00:30:32.197
OFTENTIMES IN OUR VIEW THAT THAT

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.798
HASN'T BEEN DONE.

00:30:33.865 --> 00:30:35.033
ON AND SO THE AND THAT MIGHT

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:36.334
MEAN BRINGING AND RESEARCHERS

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:37.602
EARLY ON AS THE PROGRAM'S BEING

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:39.170
ROLLED OUT --

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:40.972
TWOS KIND OF SET UP A SYSTEM FOR

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.307
YOU KNOW WHAT DATA MIGHT NEED TO

00:30:42.373 --> 00:30:42.941
BE COLLECTED --

00:30:43.007 --> 00:30:43.808
OR TO THE VALUE WITH THE PROGRAM

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:45.977
AFTER IT'S IMPLEMENTED A SO THE

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:46.477
LEGISLATURE CANNOT GET

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:48.146
INFORMATION ON ON WHAT THE

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:50.381
EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAM TO BAN --

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:51.449
AGAIN IT GETS ESPECIALLY

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:53.051
IMPORTANT GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S

00:30:53.117 --> 00:30:54.752
ROLE AS TRYING AND TRYING TO

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:56.621
SORT DEMONSTRATE WHICH POLICIES

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.890
ARE AFFECTED OF AND AND

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:01.159
THEREFORE CAN KIND OF INFLUENCE --

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:03.261
EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN OTHER

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:04.395
JURISDICTIONS.

00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:06.898
SO I WILL END MY COMMENTS THERE

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:07.398
AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:08.566
QUESTIONS.

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:10.068
WELL THIS IS GREAT AND VERY.

00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:11.769
COMPREHENSIVE I I DO APPRECIATE

ENTITIES AND THE CAPTAIN TRIPLE

00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:39.998
THAT WE KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT 80%

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.332
OF THE ENTITIES THAT ARE COVERED

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:43.134
THOSE ENTITIES AND WILDFIRES NO

00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:44.869
WE'VE GOT. TWELVE YEARS GOING

00:31:44.936 --> 00:31:47.772
FORWARD WE DO BEFORE WE GET TO

TWENTY THIRTY IN SORT OF AN AUNT.

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:51.142
IN ANTICIPATION AT THE MORE

00:31:51.209 --> 00:31:55.580
INTENSITY WHEN THE AFTERMATH OF

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:57.415
THE FIRE WITH THE CHARRED --

00:31:57.482 --> 00:31:59.050
LUMBER SITTING THERE IF WE DON'T

00:31:59.117 --> 00:32:00.418
WE MOVE WE DON'T DO ANYTHING

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:02.887
THAT CONTINUES TO ADD TO THE

00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:04.322
GREENHOUSE GAS.

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:05.823
CALCULATION WHICH WE NEVER

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.692
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT FRIEND PAT WE

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:12.030
DIDN'T INCLUDE THAT.

00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:13.498
YEAH I MEAN AND JUST BY WAY OF

00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:14.198
BACKGROUND.

00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:15.466
YOU KNOW THE CHART ON FIGURE

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:19.437
THREE WHICH KIND OF GIVES YOU A

00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:20.672
EMISSIONS THAT ARE COUNTED IN

00:32:20.738 --> 00:32:21.673
SORT OF THE OFFICIAL STATE

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:22.774
INVENTORY.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.175
OF THOSE DON'T INCLUDE --

00:32:24.242 --> 00:32:26.210
ANY SORT OF CHANGES AND CARBON

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:29.347
RELATED TO FORESTRY FOR EXAMPLE --

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:31.649
I KNOW THERE'S THERE'S

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:32.950
INCREASING WORK IN THAT AREA

00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:35.253
SORT OF TRYING TO ESTIMATE THOSE

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:35.787
THE FACTS AND I THINK ONE

00:32:35.853 --> 00:32:36.788
CHALLENGES.

00:32:36.854 --> 00:32:38.623
TRYING TO SORT OF ESTIMATE THE

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.392
SORT OF LONG TERM EFFECTS OF

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:42.560
ENOUGH YOU KNOW CARBON BEING

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:43.628
RELEASED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:45.096
THEN BEING SEQUESTERED AND AND

00:32:45.163 --> 00:32:46.230
TREES THAT MIGHT GROW SORT OF

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:47.632
BEHIND THAT AND SO.

00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:48.333
YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT SORT OF

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:49.634
THE LONG TERM --

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:51.202
CARBON IMPLICATIONS.

00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:53.538
IS IMPORTANT BUT I THINK YOU

00:32:53.604 --> 00:32:55.239
KNOW BOTTOM LINE IS --

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:57.442
SOME OF THE KIND OF OFFICIAL

00:32:57.508 --> 00:32:58.209
STATE INVENTORIES WE HAVE DON'T

00:32:58.276 --> 00:32:59.610
INCLUDE KIND OF THE NATION'S

00:32:59.677 --> 00:33:01.479
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUT IT'S

00:33:01.546 --> 00:33:02.380
CLEARLY A KIND OF AN IMPORTANT

00:33:02.447 --> 00:33:04.148
AREA -- AND

00:33:04.215 --> 00:33:06.384
I THINK THE STATUS --

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:09.287
IS IS CONTINUING TO TRY AND

00:33:09.354 --> 00:33:11.556
MONITOR AND TRY TO DO A BETTER

00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:12.590
JOB OF KIND OF COUNTY IN --

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:14.392
WHAT THOSE CHANGES ARE?

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:15.893
JUMP TO PAGE FOURTEEN OF YOUR

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.462
PRESENTATION WHAT CAN WHAT

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:18.863
LESSONS CAN WE TEACH OTHER

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:20.798
JURISDICTIONS ON REDUCING IS

00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:23.835
THIS AN AREA OF HOW WE MANAGE NO

00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:26.738
WE DO A LOT OF SUPPRESSION DO WE

00:33:26.804 --> 00:33:28.473
DO WE HAVE THE TWENTY FIRST

00:33:28.539 --> 00:33:31.242
CENTURY FORCE MANAGEMENT.

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:32.610
FOR THE CONTROLLED BURNS TO WERE

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:34.612
LIMITED GROWTH IN OUR AND OUR

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:36.447
WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE MEAN

00:33:36.514 --> 00:33:37.815
THAT THESE AREAS THAT WE SHOULD

00:33:37.882 --> 00:33:41.018
BE LOOKING AT TO HELP MEET THAT.

00:33:41.085 --> 00:33:42.453
THAT THAT THAT --

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.422
CAM TO EFFECTIVE --

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:46.491
EMISSIONS BY --

00:33:46.557 --> 00:33:47.158
TWENTY THIRTY I MEAN I I THINK

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:47.792
THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT ISSUES

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:49.193
SORT OF ON THEIR OWN I GUESS THE

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.262
DEGREE TO WHICH BAY KIND OF

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:53.998
INFLUENCE ACTIONS IN OTHER

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:55.099
JURISDICTIONS I GOT I AND I

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:56.901
FRANKLY DON'T REALLY KNOW KIND

00:33:56.968 --> 00:33:57.902
OF YOU KNOW HOW HOW THE STATE

00:33:57.969 --> 00:33:59.303
CAN KIND OF TARGET.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:00.238
ITS ACTIVITIES --

00:34:00.304 --> 00:34:03.641
TO TO DO ALL OF THE ALL OF THE

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:04.809
ISSUES THAT YOU TOUCH ON ARE

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.043
IMPORTANT --

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.178
NOT JUST FROM SORT OF A

00:34:07.245 --> 00:34:07.779
GREENHOUSE GAS PERSPECTIVE BUT

00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:09.714
JUST A AN OVERALL KIND OF PUBLIC

00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:10.581
SAFETY AND FORCED HEALTH.

00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:12.216
PERSPECTIVE --

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:13.618
I THINK THIS QUESTIONS AROUND

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:14.919
WELL HOW DO YOU.

00:34:14.986 --> 00:34:16.954
TARGET POLICIES --

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:18.222
IN A WAY THAT HAVE THAT KIND OF

00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:19.791
MAXIMUM IMPACT ON WHAT OTHER

00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:21.392
JURISDICTIONS ARE DOING IS JUST

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:23.094
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ONE AND

00:34:23.161 --> 00:34:24.862
IT'S FRANKLY I THINK DIFFICULT

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.230
FOR US TO KIND OF COME UP WITH

00:34:26.297 --> 00:34:27.632
SORT OF AN ANALYTICAL ANALYTICAL

00:34:27.698 --> 00:34:30.034
ANSWER TO THAT BUT ANYTHING IT'S

00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:30.535
OF IT THROUGH THE LENS.

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:33.771
OF ON YOUR TECHNOLOGIES OR JUST.

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:35.072
TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:38.075
OTHER JURISDICTIONS MIGHT BE.

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:39.277
WILLING.

00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:41.212
TO ADOPT SO I THINK IN

00:34:41.279 --> 00:34:42.513
PARTICULAR SOMETHING THAT'S COST

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.348
NO COST EFFECTIVE POLICIES A

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:45.383
GREAT OUT WELL ON THE ON THAT

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:46.584
METRIC YOU KNOW I THINK OTHER

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:48.286
JURISDICTIONS ARE ALSO LOOKING

00:34:48.352 --> 00:34:49.987
FOR COST EFFECTIVE POLICIES BUT

00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:50.988
AS FAR AS SORT OF TRYING.

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:53.291
TO TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHICH ONES

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:57.595
ARE GOING TO HAVE THE THE ISN'T

00:34:57.662 --> 00:34:58.963
THINKING ABOUT.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.531
SO FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:02.200
HERE IN THE SMALL GROUP OF

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:03.568
PEOPLE THAT FOLLOW THE OPTIONS

00:35:03.634 --> 00:35:05.636
IT IS AKTION SEASON FOR THE CAP

00:35:05.703 --> 00:35:07.839
AND TRADE PROGRAM SO WE'RE GOING --

00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:09.674
TO BE WATCHING THOSE NUMBERS --

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.809
THAT GO IN --

00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:13.878
THIS YEAR MY ONE OF THE

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:15.480
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS THAT

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:17.181
WE'RE STILL UNDER AB THIRTY TWO

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:18.883
WHICH REQUIRES US TO SPEND EVERY

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.384
PENNY UNDER THE LAW TO REDUCE

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:23.387
EMISSIONS AND WE HAVE.

00:35:23.454 --> 00:35:26.991
AB THREE NINETY EIGHT AND AND AB

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:28.426
SIX SEVENTEEN ARE YOU KNOW SO MP

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:29.393
ALLOW SOME WIGGLE ROOM HOW THE

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.262
LEGISLATURE MAY SPEND THE MONEY

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:34.065
BUT BUT URINALYSIS PREVIOUSLY IS

00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:35.433
ALWAYS BEEN THAT WE'RE STRICT

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.034
GUIDELINES --

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:39.670
WE CAN USE SOME OF THE AUCTION

00:35:39.737 --> 00:35:41.939
MONEY THAT COMES. FOR TWENTY

00:35:42.006 --> 00:35:44.041
TWENTY ONE OPTIONS MY NUMBERS

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:46.077
HAVE BEEN OF FOLLOWING IS ABOUT

00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:49.146
15% OF THAT IN CUT --

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:51.249
THE AUCTION PROCEEDS ARE COMING

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:51.516
IN -- FOR

00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:54.318
THESE OUT. FIVE AUCTIONS IS THAT

00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:55.520
DRIVE WITH WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE

00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:56.854
COULD HAPPEN AT LEAST THIS

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:58.122
FISCAL YEAR.

00:35:58.189 --> 00:35:59.657
E. I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT

00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:01.392
NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT I

00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:03.761
THINK SOMETHING IN THAT RANGE IS --

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:06.030
PROBABLY RIGHT I MEAN I THINK --

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:07.798
IT'S HARD TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT

00:36:07.865 --> 00:36:09.934
NUMBER OF FUTURE ALLOWANCES AS

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:11.402
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SORT OF THE

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:12.904
POST TWENTY TWENTY ALLOWANCES

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.105
HOW MANY OF THOSE WILL SELL

00:36:14.171 --> 00:36:15.907
IMMINENCE AND SOME PAST AUCTIONS

00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:16.707
THEY HAVE AN ALL SOLD SO IT.

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:17.775
NOTED THAT THE NUMBERS COULD

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:19.977
SWING A LITTLE BIT ON THAT BUT I

00:36:20.044 --> 00:36:21.979
THINK THAT GENERAL RANGE SEEMS

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:22.813
RIGHT ONE OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.382
ARE LOOKING FOR IS WHAT'S COULD

00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:25.917
BE THAT FLOOR.

00:36:25.983 --> 00:36:29.420
NUMBER AND WE YOUTH YOU HAVE A

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:32.290
AND CAP SAYS THE CAP IS GOOD

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:33.891
SENSE AND IN THE LEGISLATURE WE

00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:35.393
SET UP THE PROGRAM WE'VE GAVE

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:36.961
THE AIRPORT COMPLETE CONTROL

00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:37.228
OVER IT.

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:39.263
DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ON

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.365
WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:36:41.432 --> 00:36:46.270
SET A FLOOR OR SET A CAP GIVEN.

00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:50.608
GIVEN WITHOUT TRIGGERING A PROP.

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:51.442
TWENTY SIX POINT SIX IS A NEW

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:53.177
DEAL BUT BUT IS THAT IS THAT A

00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:55.212
POSSIBILITY THAT THAT WE COULD

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:56.314
ENCOURAGE.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.649
THE AIRPORT TO BY SETTING

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:01.085
SETTING ARE CAPPED AND NO AND NO

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:02.620
IT'S NOT PROHIBITED JUST SORT OF

00:37:02.687 --> 00:37:03.721
THINGS THAT WE NEVER THOUGHT

00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:04.589
ABOUT IF WE DO IT IN ORDER.

00:37:04.655 --> 00:37:06.591
TO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT

00:37:06.657 --> 00:37:07.925
TWENTY THIRTY GOAL NOT.

00:37:07.992 --> 00:37:09.560
AS A TAXI MECHANISM BUT SORT OF

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:10.828
FOR FILLING THE STATUTORY

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:13.197
DIRECTION THAT WE'VE GIVEN.

00:37:13.264 --> 00:37:15.032
YEAH I MEAN I THINK ON THE LEGAL

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:17.134
QUESTION --

00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:18.869
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY WE I MEAN

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:21.105
THAT'S PROBABLY A QUESTION BEST

00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:22.974
FOR COUNCILMAN ON AND BUY

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.375
SOMETHING WHICH I DON'T THINK WE

00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:25.276
CAN A PINE ON A KIND OF WEATHER

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:27.044
THOSE TYPES OF CHANGES WOULD

00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:28.646
REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE OR NOT.

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:29.547
I THINK FROM A POLICY

00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:31.349
PERSPECTIVE AND CERTAINLY THE

00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:32.817
LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE THINKING

00:37:32.883 --> 00:37:34.018
ABOUT --

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:35.453
INSURING THAT THE PROGRAM HAS

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:37.054
BEEN IMPLEMENTED AWAY THAT IT'S

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:38.456
CONSISTENT WITH ITS GOALS IN ITS

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:41.025
PRIORITIES AND THAT MIGHT MEAN

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.326
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL A MORE

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:43.527
SPECIFIC DIRECTION AND WRITE IT

00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:44.929
DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO WE YOU

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:45.830
KNOW WE DEFINITELY THINK THOSE

00:37:45.896 --> 00:37:46.631
ARE ISSUES LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE

00:37:46.697 --> 00:37:47.798
THINKING ABOUT.

00:37:47.865 --> 00:37:50.368
AND ONE FINAL QUESTION MISTER

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:53.537
CHAIR IS --

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:56.440
ONE MILLION METRIC TONS.

00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:57.975
CAN YOU GIVE US SOME GUIDANCE

00:37:58.042 --> 00:37:59.710
HERE ON AND WHEN WE GO THROUGH

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:01.145
WE WOULD LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:38:01.212 --> 00:38:02.246
PROPOSAL ON HOW THE SPEND CAP

00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:03.914
AND TRADE MONEY --

00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:05.783
AGAIN I WOULD I BELIEVE THAT

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.451
WERE.

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:08.819
WERE -- IT

00:38:08.886 --> 00:38:10.621
LOOKS LIKE WE TO GET THREE POINT

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:12.523
TWO BILLION VERSUS TWO POINT

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:13.290
FIVE BILLION BUT THE LONG THOUGH

00:38:13.357 --> 00:38:14.925
INMAY WHEN THE FINAL OPTION IS

00:38:14.992 --> 00:38:16.527
IS IS AND IT'S SO SO THAT'S AN

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:17.995
OPPORTUNITY.

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:19.163
THE MAY REVISED FOR THE FOR THE

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.399
EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND THE SENATE

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:22.566
TO LOOK AT HOW WE WOULD BEST

00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:24.902
INVESTED SHOULD I BE USING OR

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.671
SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE BE USING.

00:38:26.737 --> 00:38:30.408
THESE THESE --

00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:31.842
A PERCENTAGE IS THAT YOU'VESET

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:34.412
FORTH OF HOW MUCH 30% OF THE

00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:36.013
CUMULATIVE REDUCTION SHOULD BE

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.114
COMING FROM CAP AND TRADE SHOULD

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:38.582
SO SHOULD THAT WOULD BE THE

00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:39.850
INVESTMENT IN A SMALLER

00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:41.485
PERCENTAGE IN RENEWABLE

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:42.820
PORTFOLIO BECAUSE IT'S ONLY.

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:45.289
REPRESENTS 3% OF WHAT ARE SHORT

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:47.158
TERM TARGETS ARE I I GET THE

00:38:47.224 --> 00:38:50.261
INVESTMENT IN AND OUR RESEARCH

00:38:50.327 --> 00:38:51.362
AND DEVELOPMENT BUT IT ID SORT

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:54.565
OF GUIDELINES ON WHERE THE MONEY

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:56.434
SHOULD BE GOING.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.935
OR CAN YOU FLUSH IT OUT AND

00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.570
SEEING WHETHER MAY BE IT MAY BE

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:01.105
WE MAKE IT BETTER SHORT TERM

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:02.540
ACHIEVEMENTS BECAUSE WE CAN TALK

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:04.542
ABOUT GET MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK.

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:06.877
RIGHT -- AND

00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:07.511
I AGAIN WE'RE GOOD IT WE'VE GOT

00:39:07.578 --> 00:39:08.679
REQUEST THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:10.214
SAID ON THIS LOW CARBON FUEL

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:11.382
STANDARDS AND ALL THESE OTHER.

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:13.284
VARIOUS PROGRAMS OF WHAT WE'RE

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.519
WE'RE PUTTING THE INVESTMENT.

00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:16.687
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY

00:39:16.754 --> 00:39:19.223
THIRTY GOALS UNDERSTAND YEAH I

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:19.857
MEAN I I WOULDN'T LOOK AT THE

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:21.058
NUMBERS --

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:23.027
ON PAGE FIVE AS SORT OF

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:25.096
GUIDELINES OF HOW TO THINK ABOUT

00:39:25.162 --> 00:39:29.066
SPENDING CAP AND TRADE REVENUE --

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:30.735
I THINK WE WOULD THINK ABOUT --

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:32.903
YOU KNOW WHERE YOU KNOW FIRST

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.004
OFF WATER KIND OF LEGISLATORS

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:35.439
PRIORITIES AND IF IF THE

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:36.874
PRIORITY IS KIND OF REDUCING

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:38.075
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:40.177
WHERE ARE SORT OF GAPS --

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:41.879
EITHER IN CARBON PRICING OR JUST

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:43.781
ANOTHER POLICIES THE LEGISLATURE

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:45.382
COULD USE THE MONEY TO ENCOURAGE

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:46.517
THE MOST --

00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:48.252
PRODUCTIONS WITH THAT MONEY --

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:49.453
THAT COULD INCLUDE KIND OF YOU

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.721
KNOW FOCUSING ON SOME OF THESE

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:51.922
CATEGORIES --

00:39:51.989 --> 00:39:52.556
BUT AT THAT SORT OF DEPENDS ON

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:55.826
THE THANK --

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:56.861
YEAH BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE

00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:58.095
ALSO I THINK SORT OF OTHER GOALS

00:39:58.162 --> 00:39:58.295
THAT.

00:39:58.362 --> 00:40:00.164
IN SOME CASES LEGISLATURE HAS

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:01.499
IDENTIFIED IN COPELAND

00:40:01.565 --> 00:40:03.534
REDUCTIONS ANOTHER THING SO YOU

00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:04.702
KNOW THAT WHILE THE GX SHE'S

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:05.269
MIGHT HAVE TO BE BALANCED

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:05.836
AGAINST SOME OF THOSE OTHER

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:06.971
GOALS AS WELL.

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:08.305
WITH THE LIMITATION OF HOW MUCH

00:40:08.372 --> 00:40:10.341
OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE OPTIONS

00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:11.442
ALLOW US WITH THE FLEXIBILITY

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:13.244
VERSUS WHAT WE'RE BOUND BY LAW

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.780
TO DO SIMPLE MEDICATION RIGHT

00:40:15.846 --> 00:40:19.250
SURE I CAN'T BREAK THE LAW.

00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:19.583
BY [inaudible]

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.919
THANK YOU --

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:22.753
QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS I'VE

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:27.224
FINISHED ON THANK YOU A SERVER.

00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:28.492
THE RATE PRESENTATION I THINK

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:29.827
WITH ANY OF OUR PROGRAMS IN THE

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:32.062
STATE OF THINGS IMPORTANT --

00:40:32.129 --> 00:40:32.596
TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE

00:40:32.663 --> 00:40:34.331
SUCCESS.

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:35.099
OR LACK OF SUCCESS OF THESE

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:36.567
PROGRAMS.

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:38.602
WHY IS IT BEEN SO DIFFICULT TO

00:40:38.669 --> 00:40:39.270
ASCERTAIN THE COSTS AND BENEFITS

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:40.938
OF?

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:42.273
OUR CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAMS AS

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:46.076
IT BECAUSE WE THE DATE IS TOO

00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:47.378
HARD TO COLLECT OR IS IT BECAUSE

00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:50.948
SIMPLY IS FAILING TO COLLECT IT.

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:52.483
IN I I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:54.084
OF BOTH --

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:55.119
AT EIGHT I DO WANT TO BE UP

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:56.053
FRONT THAT --

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.755
IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TRY

00:40:57.822 --> 00:40:59.356
TO SORT OF TEASE OUT AND SPECIFY

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:00.624
THE EXACT AFFECTED FOR

00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:02.459
PARTICULAR POLICY AMONGST A WIDE

00:41:02.526 --> 00:41:04.128
VARIETY OF OTHER FACTORS THAT

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:05.596
AFFECT EMISSIONS AND COSTS.

00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:07.865
IN OTHER WAYS --

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:09.967
WE DO THINK THAT --

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:13.070
WITH KIND OF A MORE VALUATION

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:14.705
THERE'S PROBABLY OPPORTUNITIES

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:16.140
TO JUST TO GET SOME BETTER

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:18.309
INFORMATION MAYBE NOT ON EVERY

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:19.510
SINGLE POLICY BUT ON SOME OF

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:20.144
THEM -- AND

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:23.214
MIGHT REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES --

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.348
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:25.182
THINK JUST LOOKING BACK AT

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:26.584
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:27.985
IMPLEMENTED --

00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:28.953
THERE MAY BE SOME CHALLENGES

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:30.254
THERE BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:31.322
OF SMART PEOPLE IN THE STATE

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:31.922
THAT --

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:33.457
CONTRITE A SORT OF TEASE OUT THE

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:35.426
EFFECTS OF PARTICULAR POLICIES

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:36.460
BUT ME ON SOME INSTANCES IT

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:38.896
MIGHT BE LIMITED.

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:40.631
I THINK ON A ON A GOING.

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:41.532
GOING FORWARD BASIS TRYING TO

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.800
THINK ABOUT BEFORE HAND AS

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:44.468
POLICIES ARE BEING EITHER

00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:46.203
EXPANDED OR NEW POLICIES ARE

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.671
BEING IMPLEMENTED --

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:48.739
AND OUR VIEW TRYING TO THINK

00:41:48.806 --> 00:41:49.573
ABOUT --

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.308
BEFORE THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED HOW

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:52.443
IS THE STATE GOING TO BE

00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:54.345
EVALUATING THOSE PROGRAMS AFTER

00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:56.180
THEIR IMPLEMENTED IS THERE SORT

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.348
OF A PROCESS IN PLACE.

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:58.182
FOR YOU HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO

00:41:58.249 --> 00:42:00.284
THAT -- AND

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:00.985
PLANNING --

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:02.753
THAT UP FRONT CAN BE VERY

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.188
HELPFUL IN TRYING.

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:06.323
TO IDENTIFY YOU KNOW EITHER WHAT

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:08.292
TYPE OF DATA MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:09.393
ORDER TO KIND OF VALUE WITH THE

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.394
PROGRAM SEVERAL YEARS DOWN THE

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:11.495
LINE.

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:12.796
OR IN SOME CASES IT MIGHT MEAN

00:42:12.863 --> 00:42:15.165
TRYING TO SET THE PROGRAM UP IN

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:16.333
A WAY THAT FACILITATES

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.369
EVALUATION FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:20.237
PILOTS BEING ED AND CERTAIN

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:21.939
AREAS EARLY ON AND THEN.

00:42:22.006 --> 00:42:23.474
USING THAT AS SORT OF A A WAY TO

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:27.311
EVALUATE IT BEFORE BEFORE IT

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:27.878
GETS EXPANDED.

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:29.680
APPRECIATE THAT --

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:30.981
I'M PAGE --

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:31.615
TEN YOU'RE LA --

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:35.119
ASSESSMENT A CAPTAIN A SICKLY --

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:37.554
OPINED THAT --

00:42:37.621 --> 00:42:41.058
SOME OF THE BANK ALLOWANCES --

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:43.160
COULD AND ACCORDING TO YOUR

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:45.496
PRODUCTION NOT ALLOW US TO MEET

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:49.266
OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS --

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:49.967
DO YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:53.070
NECESSITY AS A RESULT OF THAT.

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:54.571
LACK OF ATTAINMENT TO MODIFY THE

00:42:54.638 --> 00:42:57.441
PROGRAM IN ANYWAY.

00:42:57.508 --> 00:42:59.543
I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:00.844
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT AND WHERE

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:02.179
EMISSIONS WILL BE GOING GOING

00:43:02.246 --> 00:43:04.048
FORWARD I MEAN THE EXAMPLE THAT

00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:05.683
WE PERCENT ON THAT CHART IS JUST

00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:07.318
ONE EXAMPLE THERE ARE OTHER.

00:43:07.384 --> 00:43:08.352
SCENARIOS THAT COULD BE

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:09.987
DIFFERENT --

00:43:10.054 --> 00:43:12.356
BUT WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT --

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:13.424
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:16.126
TO ASK CARP FOR EXAMPLE HOW THEY

00:43:16.193 --> 00:43:18.295
ENVISION CAP AND TRADE ENSURING

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:19.730
THAT THE STATE NEEDS THAT GOAL

00:43:19.797 --> 00:43:21.332
VOCALIST THAT IS IN FACT SORT OF

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:22.499
A PART OF THE REASON FOR HAVING

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:23.767
CAP AND TRADE AS ENSURING THAT

00:43:23.834 --> 00:43:24.868
WILL BE THE TOOL TO KIND OF HELP.

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.503
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL UNDER WHAT

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.373
SCENARIOS MIGHT THAT NOT HAPPEN

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:29.840
AND WATER SORT F THE

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:31.442
CONTINGENCY PLANS OR WHAT ARE

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:32.910
THE OPTIONS.

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:34.178
FOR RESTRUCTURING THE PROGRAM OR

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.646
JUST MODIFYING THE PROGRAM IN

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:37.448
SOME WAYS TO PROVIDE GREATER

00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:39.116
CERTAINTY THAT IT CAN ACHIEVE

00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:40.718
THAT -- I

00:43:40.784 --> 00:43:41.752
MEAN IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT YOU

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:43.020
KNOW MAKING THOSE ADJUSTMENTS

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:44.488
COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:46.156
INCREASING ALLOWANCE PRICES AND

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:48.525
THAT'S ONE OF THE TRADE OFFS --

00:43:48.592 --> 00:43:49.760
BUT IN OUR VIEW YOU KNOW SETTING

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:51.028
UP THE PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT'S

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:52.429
CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERALL

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:54.365
AMBITION OF THE STATE'S GOALS IS

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:55.232
IMPORTANT.

00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:58.235
AND YOU HAVE OTHER TOOLS LIKE A

00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:01.338
PRICE CEILING FOR A CONCERNS

00:44:01.405 --> 00:44:02.172
AROUND --

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:03.640
YOU KNOW COSTS BECOMING TOO HIGH

00:44:03.707 --> 00:44:05.476
AND SO WE THINK THAT SORT OF THE

00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:06.443
TOOL THAT COULD BE USED TO CUT

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:08.345
MEDICAID THAT BUT THE THE THE

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:09.847
CAPS AND SORT THE PROGRAM

00:44:09.913 --> 00:44:10.748
STRUCTURE OF THE NUMBER OF

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:11.815
ALLOWANCES BEING ISSUED SHOULD

00:44:11.882 --> 00:44:12.816
BE SAID IN A WAY THAT'S

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:14.084
CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE.

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.519
GOALS IS IT YOUR OPINION THAT WE

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:17.187
SHOULD BE LIMITING --

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:19.990
FINITE LEE THE AMOUNT OF

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:22.726
ALLOWANCES THAT CAN BE PURCHASED --

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:25.796
I MEAN I HATE.

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:28.332
I THINK OF THE LEGISLATURE IN

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:30.234
ADOPTING AB THREE NINETY AIDS.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.469
ESTABLISHED A HARD PRICE CEILING

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:34.338
AND DIRECTED CARP TO ESTABLISH A

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:35.272
HARD PRICE CEILING AND I THINK

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:37.975
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD REASONS TO

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:39.076
DO THAT --

00:44:39.143 --> 00:44:40.344
ULTIMATELY THERE'S GOING TO BE A

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:41.345
SORT OF A TRADE OFF BETWEEN

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:44.181
COSTS IN A MISSION CERTAINTY AND

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:45.449
AT SOME POINT --

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:47.184
YOU KNOW MAYBE THE COST MIGHT

00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:48.352
JUST BE A LITTLE BIT TOO HIGH IN

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:49.386
YOUR AND THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

00:44:49.453 --> 00:44:51.288
BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE SOME OF

00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:54.625
THE EMISSIONS CERTAINTY AND SO.

00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:56.794
THAT INTO A PRICE CEILING.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.428
IT'S A LOT OF SENSE AND SIR

00:44:57.494 --> 00:44:58.062
TRYING TO BALANCE THOSE TRADE

00:44:58.128 --> 00:44:58.962
OFFS AND REALLY.

00:44:59.029 --> 00:44:59.630
I THINK THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT

00:44:59.696 --> 00:45:01.432
MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT

00:45:01.498 --> 00:45:03.133
IS TO ISSUE KIND OF AN UNLIMITED

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.868
NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES AT THAT

00:45:04.935 --> 00:45:05.803
PRICE CEILING AND SO WE THINK

00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:07.504
THAT SORT OF DESIGN MECHANISM.

00:45:07.571 --> 00:45:09.640
MAKES MAKES SOME SENSE --

00:45:09.706 --> 00:45:11.275
WHERE YOU KIND OF SET THAT PRICE

00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:12.376
CEILING IS AN IMPORTANT

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:14.578
CONSIDERATION --

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:15.145
BUT THE THE OVERALL SORT OF

00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:18.482
DESIGN OF SINCE INTERVIEW.

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:33.330
THANK YOU.

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:34.932
ARE THERE ANY MORE QUESTIONS

00:45:34.998 --> 00:45:35.165
FROM --

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.201
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:38.535
I JUST HAD A QUICK WHEN I WAS

00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:42.773
CURIOUS ON PAGE BY PAGE TEN PAGE

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.174
SKEWS GIVES A PAGE.

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:45.342
THIRTEEN OF REGARDING THE

00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:47.845
TRANSPORTATION POLICIES SEEM TO

00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:49.746
GENERALLY BE MORE COSTLY.

00:45:49.813 --> 00:45:51.381
IN CAP AND TRADE WHAT SORT OF AN

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:54.318
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS COULD WE USE

00:45:54.384 --> 00:45:56.453
TO SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.421
TRANSPORTATION.

00:45:57.488 --> 00:45:59.423
ARE YOU MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:03.093
IMPACT N ON THE ARE.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.429
JOB CENTERS JOBS OPPORTUNITIES

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:07.030
THAT SEEMS TO BE WHERE MOST OF

00:46:07.097 --> 00:46:09.633
THEM BIG CONCERN IS FOCUSED NOW

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:10.567
ON AND CERTAINLY WITH THE

00:46:10.634 --> 00:46:12.536
TRANSPORTATION POLICIES A LOT OF

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:13.704
THE RESISTANCE.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.205
TO CLIMATE CHANGE WHETHER IT'S

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:17.174
REAL OR NOT REAL HOW TO DO IT

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:18.742
PEOPLE PUSHING BACK ON THE

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:20.677
IMPACT OF THE TRANSPORTATION

00:46:20.744 --> 00:46:22.613
POLICIES THAT HAVE BECOME PART

00:46:22.679 --> 00:46:23.347
OF THE F..

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:26.250
SO HOW DO WE LOOK AT THAT

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:26.550
[inaudible]

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:28.485
GOING FORWARD.

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:29.720
I'M I MEAN I THINK LIKE WITH ALL

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:31.255
THESE ISSUES IS TRYING TO SORT

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:33.657
OF STRIKE THAT RIGHT BALANCE

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:34.925
BETWEEN.

00:46:34.992 --> 00:46:35.792
THE STATE'S BUREAU CHIEF IN

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:36.260
THOSE --

00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:38.562
GOALS AND I'M TRYING TO DO THEM

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.197
AND THE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

00:46:40.264 --> 00:46:42.366
WAY -- AND

00:46:42.432 --> 00:46:43.333
YOU KNOW IT I THINK IT REALLY

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.601
JUST IT'S IT'S ON KIND OF A CASE

00:46:44.668 --> 00:46:46.136
BY CASE BASIS IT SORT OF DEPENDS

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:48.338
ON WHAT'S POLICY YOU'RE LOOKING

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:50.374
AT BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT A

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.608
LOT OF THE TRANSPORTATION

00:46:51.675 --> 00:46:53.443
RELATED POLICIES ALTHOUGH.

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.412
MANY OF THEM FOCUS ON GREENHOUSE

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:56.914
GAS EMISSIONS.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.348
THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE BEING

00:46:58.415 --> 00:47:00.350
IMPLEMENTED IN PART TO ACHIEVE

00:47:00.417 --> 00:47:01.251
OTHER --

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:03.320
OTHER GOALS LIKE --

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:04.655
IMPROVEMENTS IN REGIONAL AND

00:47:04.721 --> 00:47:06.657
LOCAL AIR QUALITY AND SO --

00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:07.291
YOU KNOW TRYING TO SORT OF VALUE

00:47:07.357 --> 00:47:10.994
WAIT THE PRINCIPALLY I MEAN GHG

00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:12.362
EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND KIND OF

00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:13.764
COST PER TON IS AN IMPORTANT

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:14.865
METRIC BUT THERE ARE OTHER.

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:16.300
IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT NEED TO

00:47:16.366 --> 00:47:17.968
BE CONSIDERED AS WELL WILL YOU

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:19.236
MAKE IT SOUND GENERALLY THEY'RE

00:47:19.303 --> 00:47:21.138
MORE COSTLY THAN CAP AND TRADE

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:22.773
IT SEEMS TO ME WE NEED.

00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:23.974
MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:25.909
WHAT SPECIFIC.

00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:27.377
AREA FENCE REALLY WE NEED TO

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:30.414
TARGET TO BRING SOME BALANCE.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.418
YEAH YEAH I'M I'M IN --

00:47:34.484 --> 00:47:36.553
THE COUPLE THE PROGRAMS THAT WE

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.288
LOOKED AT HAD JUST --

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:39.356
COSTS THAT WERE --

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:40.657
YOU KNOW AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE

00:47:40.724 --> 00:47:42.326
HIGHER THAN KIND OF THE CURRENT

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:44.895
CAP AND TRADE ALLOWANCE PRICE --

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:46.463
AT NOT KIND OF FOR THE MARGINAL

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.065
EMISSION REDUCTION OR THE KIND

00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:48.899
OF THE INCREMENTAL EMISSION

00:47:48.966 --> 00:47:50.934
REDUCTION --

00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:52.269
MINUTE --

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:53.437
JUST TO KIND OF REITERATE I

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:54.838
THINK YOU KNOW IN OUR VIEW.

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:56.473
TRYING TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.076
WAYS IN WHICH POLICY USE KIND OF

00:47:59.142 --> 00:48:01.144
WRAP AROUND OR OR A CHEAP THINGS

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:01.712
THAT CARBON PRICING DOESN'T

00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:02.846
ACHIEVE THIS IS ESPECIALLY

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:04.581
IMPORTANT AND THERE.

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:05.983
MAY BE SOME I KNOW AND THAT AND

00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:07.651
THE HEAVY DUTY SPACE AGAIN --

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:09.052
THERE'S A LOT OF POLICIES RE

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:10.454
REFER AT THAT REVOLVED AROUND

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.488
KIND OF PILOTS AND

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.357
DEMONSTRATIONS AS WELL AS

00:48:13.423 --> 00:48:14.224
PRODUCTIONS AND AND CO

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:16.293
POLLUTANTS AND SO THERE'S A LOT

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:16.927
OF BENEFITS OF THOSE TYPES OF

00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:17.995
THINGS BUT TRYING TO THINK ABOUT

00:48:18.061 --> 00:48:19.363
HOW THOSE PROGRAMS.

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:23.367
CAN BE TARGETED TO ACHIEVE THOSE

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:27.471
GOALS ABOUT THE CHIEF YOU KNOW

00:48:27.537 --> 00:48:28.405
EITHER A PROMOTE MET PROMOTING A

00:48:28.472 --> 00:48:30.173
PARTICULAR TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY OR

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.142
ADVANCEMENT IN TECHNOLOGIES OR

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:33.610
REDUCING COPELAND'S IS IMPORTANT.

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:35.479
BUT THANK YOU IT SEEMS TO ME

00:48:35.545 --> 00:48:38.615
THAT MIGHT BE WHERE ARE YOU DO

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:38.915
YOU REALLY.

00:48:38.982 --> 00:48:40.617
TAKE A LOOK.

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:41.251
IS IT BETTER RECEIVED BY THE

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:42.953
PUBLIC AND CERTAINLY THE COST OF

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.454
LIVING ISSUES THAT.

00:48:44.521 --> 00:48:47.190
ARE FORMERLY CONNECTED TO MUCH

00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:48.492
OF THAT FROM THE THANK YOU

00:48:48.558 --> 00:48:51.828
REPRESENTATION MICROBIAL SPRAY

00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:54.031
LEARNED.

00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:55.132
WHAT WE'RE WHERE DO YOU JUST?

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.366
WHEN YOU SEE THAT 38% NUMBER AND

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:57.234
THE SCOPING [inaudible]

00:48:57.301 --> 00:48:58.302
PLAN [inaudible]

00:48:58.368 --> 00:48:59.803
DOES THAT.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:00.470
WHERE'S THAT SIT WITH YOU DOES

00:49:00.537 --> 00:49:02.773
THAT DOES THAT SEEM OUTLANDISH

00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:04.608
DOES IT SEEM DOABLE THE SEEM

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:05.809
REASONABLE --

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:10.280
WHAT WERE YOU ON THAT NUMBER?

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:12.482
IN I MEAN A I GUESS I HAVE A

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:15.152
COUPLE OF THOUGHTS ON IN --

00:49:15.218 --> 00:49:16.119
ONE WE WE THINK RELYING ON

00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:17.354
CARBON PRICING AS SORT OF A

00:49:17.421 --> 00:49:18.655
SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF EMISSION

00:49:18.722 --> 00:49:19.856
REDUCTIONS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE

00:49:19.923 --> 00:49:21.892
BECAUSE WE DO THINK IT IS THE

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:24.261
MOST COST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY --

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:27.564
I THINK THE OTHER THOUGHT IS --

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:28.598
AND THE KEY QUESTION IS WE ASK

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:30.567
IS IS THE PROGRAM SET UP IN A

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:33.003
WAY THAT WOULD KIND OF ACHIEVE

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:33.437
THOSE.

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:34.638
THOSE TYPES OF REDUCTIONS THAT

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:37.641
SORT OF 38% AND SO --

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:38.875
YEAH RIGHT THAT'S WERE SORT OF

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:40.444
QUESTIONS AROUND IS THE PROGRAM

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:41.645
ARE SORT OF THE LEVEL OF THE

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:43.380
CAPS OR JUST THE THE KIND

00:49:43.447 --> 00:49:44.147
GENERAL SET UP OF THE PROGRAM IS

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:45.982
IT -- IN

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:48.452
LINE WITH KIND OF THE THE THE

00:49:48.518 --> 00:49:50.821
TRUNK OF THE PILOT IS BINS WERE

00:49:50.887 --> 00:49:52.422
CARVED OUT FOR IT.

00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:53.490
IS IT YOUR SENSE THAT THE AIR BE

00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:54.758
HAS ENOUGH TOOLS.

00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:57.260
TO GET MORE AGGRESSIVE AND AND

00:49:57.327 --> 00:49:58.795
AND AND KNOCK IT DOWN.

00:49:58.862 --> 00:50:00.731
ADEQUATELY IMMEDIATE GIVEN ALL

00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:01.498
THE POLITICAL PRESSURES THAT

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:02.666
EXIST.

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:04.000
BUT I THINK THAT --

00:50:04.067 --> 00:50:06.236
THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:08.171
A WIDE VARIETY OF CHANGES TO THE

00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:08.839
PROGRAM INCLUDING CHANGES.

00:50:08.905 --> 00:50:10.974
THAT.

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:11.975
MIGHT IT JUST FUTURE COPS OR

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:13.176
MAYBE JUST SORT OF A SET OF

00:50:13.243 --> 00:50:14.878
RULES RELATED --

00:50:14.945 --> 00:50:16.546
TO FUTURE CAPS IF IF THE BANK OF

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:18.415
ALLOWANCES GETS TOO LARGE FOR

00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:20.350
EXAMPLE --

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:21.251
MS IT ALMOST A SIGNAL THAT

00:50:21.318 --> 00:50:22.686
THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA GET MORE

00:50:22.753 --> 00:50:24.020
AGGRESSIVE IS THAT IS THAT THE

00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:26.323
MESSAGE IS BEING SENT BY THAT.

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.957
YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S PROBABLY A

00:50:27.023 --> 00:50:31.762
QUESTION BUT I MEAN IT IS --

00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:33.430
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A TOUGH

00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:35.065
BALANCE AS WELL I MEAN YOU KNOW

00:50:35.132 --> 00:50:37.467
GIVEN THE AMBITION OF THE GOALS

00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:41.204
THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT

00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:42.139
INSIGNIFICANT CHANCE THAT YOUR

00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:44.107
PRICES IN ORDER TO KIND OF IF IF

00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:44.841
THESE TYPES OF JUDGMENTS ARE

00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:45.809
MADE.

00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:47.043
THAT PRICES COULD INCREASE

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:48.478
SIGNIFICANTLY ANSWERS ARE TRYING

00:50:48.545 --> 00:50:49.312
TO MANAGE.

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:50.814
THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:53.016
HIGHER PRICES IS DEFINITELY A

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.451
CONCERN AND SOMETHING THAT NEEDS

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:54.684
TO BE.

00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:57.754
THOUGHT THROUGH CAREFULLY --

00:50:57.821 --> 00:50:58.355
BUT AGAIN WE DO THINK SORT OF

00:50:58.422 --> 00:51:02.092
YOUR FOLKS MISSIONS TARGETS BUT

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:02.759

CEILINGS AND AND SPEED BUMPS AND

00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:06.329
OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT TO MANAGE.

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:07.664
AND COSTS IS IS REALLY THE BEST

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:11.468
WRITER SHE CRIME.

THIS MORNING AT THE BEGINNING OF

00:51:58.482 --> 00:51:59.382
THIS HEARING --

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:02.419

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:03.653
INSPIRATION AYE YEAH RIGHT IT

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.822

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:07.357
HOPEFULLY --

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:09.826
SETTING OF THE STAGE FOR WHAT I

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:11.328
HOPE IS GOING TO BE.

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:16.533
OF A YEAR OF COLLABORATION AND

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.669
THINKING OF WHICH IN WHICH WE

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:21.771
CAN EXPAND UPON AND IMPROVE OUR

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:23.406
CURRENT PROGRAMS.

00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:25.709
AND I THINK IT INDICATES AS YOU

00:52:25.775 --> 00:52:26.977
CAN TELL THAT I HAVE A

00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:28.879
PROPENSITY FOR THINKING OUT LOUD

00:52:28.945 --> 00:52:30.447
BUT WHEN I DO.

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:33.083
IT'S IN THE DIRECTION OF TRYING

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:34.484
TO CONSTANTLY BE ASKING THE

00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:37.387
QUESTION OF HOW WE CAN DO BETTER.

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:38.722
AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:39.756
THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:41.458
ARE DOING THE SAME THING.

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:42.893
AND SO --

00:52:42.959 --> 00:52:45.328
I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE ABOUT THE

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:46.663
OPPORTUNITIES --

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:48.298
I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE LA --

00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:49.900
I'M SURE WE WILL AGREE WITH SOME

00:52:49.966 --> 00:52:51.635
OF THEIR POINTS AND I KNOW WE

00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:53.303
DISAGREE WITH OTHERS BUT THE I

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.805
THINK HE HAS LEFT OUT.

00:52:55.872 --> 00:52:57.607
ONE ELEMENT OF THE BENEFITS OF

00:52:57.674 --> 00:52:59.809
THIS PROGRAM TO CALIFORNIA AND

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:01.545
THAT IS THE REVENUE THAT HAS

00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:03.880
BEEN COMING FOR THE LAST SEVERAL

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:05.348
YEARS FROM INTERNATIONAL

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:06.650
VISITORS.

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:07.918
AS WELL AS PEOPLE FROM OTHER

00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:09.386
STATES TRIPPING THROUGH

00:53:09.452 --> 00:53:10.687
CALIFORNIA TO LEARN WHAT WE'RE

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:12.822
DOING AND HOW WE'RE DOING IT I'M

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:14.391
BEING A LITTLE BIT FACETIOUS BUT

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:17.427
OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:18.662
BUT THAT WAS REFERRED TO BY.

00:53:18.728 --> 00:53:21.431
SENATOR Y. CASKEY IS A VERY REAL

00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:22.465
[inaudible]

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:25.268
IT'S ALSO THINGS THAT WE DON'T

00:53:25.335 --> 00:53:27.604
ENTIRELY KNOW HOW TO QUANTIFY

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:29.139
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT OTHER

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:31.141
STATES OR OTHER SUBNATIONAL

00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:32.742
JURISDICTIONS --

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:34.444
PICK UP ON THINGS THAT WE ARE

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:36.513
DOING WE ARE HELPING TO MOVE THE

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.715
NEEDLE AND A MUCH BIGGER WAY

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:41.051
THAN CALIFORNIA CAN DO A LOAN

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:42.953
AND AT A TIME WHEN.

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:45.255
AS WE ALL ARE AWARE OUR NATIONAL

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:48.358
GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME A LEADER

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:51.027
IN THE ANTI TERRORIST OUT ANTI

00:53:51.094 --> 00:53:54.164
ACTION MOVEMENT ON BUT I BELIEVE

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:56.066
WE ALL AGREE IS.

00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:58.168
THE SINGLE MOST PRESSING

00:53:58.234 --> 00:54:00.337
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM OF OUR

00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:01.605
TIME -- I

00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:03.740
THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT IT'S

00:54:03.807 --> 00:54:04.307
WORTH --

00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:07.510
CONTINUING TO REMEMBER SO --

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:09.079
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT.

00:54:09.145 --> 00:54:10.614
ABOUT THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.148
TAKEN --

00:54:12.215 --> 00:54:17.787
SINCE I REJOINED THE BOARD AND

00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:18.555
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND WE

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:20.557
DEVELOPED THE FIRST SCOPING PLAN

00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:22.058
UNDER AB.

00:54:22.125 --> 00:54:24.361
THIRTY TO THE APPROACH THAT WE

00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:27.530
HAVE TAKEN SENATE TARGET AND

00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:29.299
THIS IS VERY SIMPLE THE WAY THAT

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:31.368
THE A. R. B. HAS APPROACHED ITS.

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:32.969
TASK IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT AS

00:54:33.036 --> 00:54:36.439
WELL IS TO LOOK AT THE SCOPE OF

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:37.007
THE PROBLEM.

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:38.742
SET A TARGET IN TERMS OF NUMBER

00:54:38.808 --> 00:54:41.077
OF TONS THAT NEED TO BE REMOVED

00:54:41.144 --> 00:54:42.445
FROM THE AIR.

00:54:42.512 --> 00:54:44.881
AND THEN DEVELOP A PLAN TO

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:47.217
REMOVE THOSE TONS --

00:54:47.283 --> 00:54:49.052
THIS IS NOT THE WAY EVERYBODY

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:51.087
DOES THESE THINGS AND FOR

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:54.858
EXAMPLE OF ONE COULD --

00:54:54.924 --> 00:54:56.526
IMAGINE A THERE'S A CARBON

00:54:56.593 --> 00:54:58.928
PRICING PROGRAM THAT DID NOTHING

00:54:58.995 --> 00:55:01.031
BUT PUT A PRICE ON CARBON

00:55:01.097 --> 00:55:03.566
WITHOUT HAVING A TARGET AND YOU

00:55:03.633 --> 00:55:05.669
WOULD ACHIEVE SOME REDUCTIONS BY

00:55:05.735 --> 00:55:05.869
THAT.

00:55:05.935 --> 00:55:07.303
BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOU

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:08.605
WERE CHEATING ENOUGH FOR TOO

00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:10.640
MANY -- AND

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:12.876
YOU WOULDN'T BE TAKING ADVANTAGE

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.511
OF SOME OF THE OTHER TYPES OF

00:55:14.577 --> 00:55:17.380
TOOLS THAT CAN BE USED --

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:19.582
WE HAVE HAD OUR PROGRAM --

00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:22.385
EVALUATED AND HAVE TAKEN INPUT

00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:22.585
FROM.

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:24.487
COMMITTEES AND BOARDS OF

00:55:24.554 --> 00:55:26.856
ECONOMIC ADVISERS GOING TO THAT

00:55:26.923 --> 00:55:28.324
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:32.395
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

00:55:32.462 --> 00:55:33.096
THAT.

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:35.598
IF YOUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE A SET

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:38.635
NUMBER OF EMISSIONS THAT THE MIX

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:41.304
OF BANDAIDS AND INCENTIVES AND

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:44.307
PRICING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS USED.

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:46.843
IS PROBABLY THE MOST COST

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:48.712
EFFECTIVE WAY YOU COULD HAVE

00:55:48.778 --> 00:55:51.948
GONE ABOUT ACHIEVING THAT GOAL.

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:53.983
WHO SAID THAT WHO THAT WAS SAID

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:57.020
BACK IN 200-010-2000 --

00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:58.388
TWELVE WE HAD AN MRI AND

00:55:58.455 --> 00:56:01.491
ECONOMIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE --

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:02.926
WE'VE HAD --

00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:04.994
PEOPLE LIKE.

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:07.297
THAT NOW NOW MEMBER FOR THOSE

00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:08.798
CASO BOARD DOES SEVEN POINTS

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:09.833
BEING AND OTHERS WHO'VE SERVED

00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:11.601
AS ADVISERS TO THE PROGRAM OVER

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:12.702
THE YEARS.

00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:14.471
AND THEY REPEATEDLY LOOKED AT

00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:18.174
THESE I'LL BE HAPPY TO FURNISH

00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:19.943
YOU WITH SOME.

00:56:20.009 --> 00:56:22.312
QUOTES ARE CITATIONS ON THAT --

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:24.481
BUT I THINK WE ARE NOW AT A

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:25.949
POINT WHERE WE CAN SEE THAT

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:29.686
MOVING AHEAD TOWARDS OUR TWENTY

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:30.653
THIRTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.321
GOALS.

00:56:31.387 --> 00:56:32.756
WE NEED TO GO FURTHER AND WE

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:35.125
NEED A FASTER AND THAT'S TRUE

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:37.026
FOR CALIFORNIA'S GOALS IT'S ALSO

00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:40.029
TRUE FOR THE WORLD'S GOALS THAT.

00:56:40.096 --> 00:56:44.100
ARE NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE AND

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:46.002
NOW THE VERY SERIOUS THE FACTS

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:47.237
OF THE WARMING THAT'S ALREADY

00:56:47.303 --> 00:56:49.139
TAKING PLACE AND WHAT'S ALREADY

00:56:49.205 --> 00:56:52.375
BEEN BAKED INTO THE SYSTEM.

00:56:52.442 --> 00:56:53.443
SO -- WE

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:54.778
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ARRAY OF

00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:55.779
TOOLS THAT WE HAVE AT OUR

00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:58.014
DISPOSAL AND WHETHER THERE WERE%

00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:59.449
USING ALL OF THEM AND WHETHER

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:00.116
THERE'S OTHERS THAT WE HAVEN'T

00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:02.051
THOUGHT OF AND WHETHER WE CAN

00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:04.020
TWEAK ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS TO

00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:05.021
MAKE THEM BETTER.

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:07.357
CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM IN ADDITION

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:08.558
TO THE CAP AND TRADE AND BY THE

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:09.859
WAY HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT

00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:11.895
THERE'S AN AUCTION GOING ON EVEN

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:13.429
AS WE SPEAK.

00:57:13.496 --> 00:57:15.398
OKAY ONE PERSON WHO FOLLOWS IT

00:57:15.465 --> 00:57:18.001
ON THE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HAD.

00:57:18.067 --> 00:57:19.936
QUARTERLY AUCTIONS AND FROM THE

00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:21.805
BEGINNING OF THIS PROGRAM THAT

00:57:21.871 --> 00:57:23.840
HAVE RAISED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS --

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:25.642
IS WELL KNOWN BUT THE FACT THAT

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:27.577
AN OPTION IS TAKING PLACE ON ANY

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:29.746
GIVEN DAY OR WHAT THE RESULTS OF

00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:30.647
THAT AUCTION ARE.

00:57:30.713 --> 00:57:33.216
SELDOM PERCEIVED BY THE PUBLIC

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:35.885
AND ACTUALLY WE THINK THAT'S A

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:37.654
GOOD THING OUT WITH OKAY IF YOU

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.955
KNOW BUT IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:41.291
EVEN OKAY FOR ME TO ASK LIKE

00:57:41.357 --> 00:57:42.926
WHAT OF THE BIDS LOOKING LIKE

00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:43.993
WHAT WHAT'S COMING IN HOUSE IT

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:44.327
GOING.

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:46.696
THIS TAKES PLACE IN A COMPLETELY

00:57:46.763 --> 00:57:49.599
SEALED ATMOSPHERE --

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:51.234
WE DON'T CERTIFY THE RESULTS OF

00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:53.403
THE AUCTION UNTIL THERE'S AN

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:54.370
OUTSIDE MONITORING COMMITTEE

00:57:54.437 --> 00:57:56.539
THAT SAYS THAT THE AUCTION WAS

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:58.441
CONDUCTED IN A FAIR.

00:57:58.508 --> 00:57:59.809
WAY -- WE

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:04.280
HAVE NEVER ELATION OR INSIDER

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:06.783
TRADING OR OF THE THINGS

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:08.451
THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:10.186
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TALKING

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:10.954
ABOUT CREATING A MARKET AND

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:12.755
ALLOWANCES WERE WHAT PEOPLE WERE

00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:14.457
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU KNOW

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:16.359
MARKETS WEREN'T LOOKING THAT.

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:18.895
GOOD BACK THEN AS A SOMETHING

00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:19.662
THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:21.798
CONFIDENCE IN WORKING FAIRLY AND

00:58:21.865 --> 00:58:23.166
NOW WE FIND OURSELVES IN A

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:25.568
SITUATION WHERE INDEED THIS

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:27.337
MARKET HAS FUNCTIONED --

00:58:27.403 --> 00:58:29.405
IN A CLEAN AND EFFECTIVE MANNER

00:58:29.472 --> 00:58:31.107
AND I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:33.309
CONTINUE TO DO THAT BUT THAT'S

00:58:33.376 --> 00:58:34.844
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY --

00:58:34.911 --> 00:58:37.347
I DON'T SPECULATE OF A LOUD

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:38.514
ABOUT CHANGES WE MIGHT BE

00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:40.250
THINKING ABOUT MAKING TO THE

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.517
MARKET BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

00:58:41.584 --> 00:58:43.519
SEND ANY SIGNALS --

00:58:43.586 --> 00:58:45.021
IN ADVANCE OF A FORMAL

00:58:45.088 --> 00:58:47.390
RULEMAKING OPEN PROCEDURE FOR

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:48.658
FEAR THAT --

00:58:48.725 --> 00:58:51.227
THAT THAT MIGHT CAUSE A PROBLEM

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:52.228
SO -- IN

00:58:52.295 --> 00:58:54.264
ADDITION TO THE MARKET OF COURSE --

00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:56.566
WE ALSO HAVE AND THIS IS PERHAPS

00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:57.667
THE FUNDAMENTAL.

00:58:57.734 --> 00:58:59.135
BUILDING BLOCK OF THE ENTIRE

00:58:59.202 --> 00:59:01.371
PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA IS THE

00:59:01.437 --> 00:59:05.208
HOUR OF VEHICLE PROGRAMS THE OUT

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:06.943
THE LOW CARBON OR THE HELP LEVEL

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.344
EMISSIONS AND ZERO EMISSION

00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:10.346
VEHICLE PROGRAMS AT THE STATE

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:11.447
OPERATES.

00:59:11.514 --> 00:59:13.316
OUT WHICH ARE UNDER THREAT.

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:16.619
AGAIN EVEN AS WE MEET HERE TODAY --

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:19.055
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL BE

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:20.223
AN ANNOUNCEMENT COMING OUT OF

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:22.458
THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THEY INTEND

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:23.993
TO PROCEED FULL STEAM AHEAD ON

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.261
ROLLING BACK.

00:59:25.328 --> 00:59:32.568
THE OBAMA ERA A FEEL OF AND WE

00:59:32.635 --> 00:59:33.736
HEAR THIS IS NOT EXACTLY A

00:59:33.803 --> 00:59:36.105
SURPRISE BUT THE ONLY THING

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:36.706
THAT'S A SURPRISE ABOUT IT IS

00:59:36.773 --> 00:59:37.573
THAT THEY'VE.

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.442
APPARENTLY CHOSEN TO PUT OUT A

00:59:39.509 --> 00:59:42.478
BIG BLAST AT CALIFORNIA TODAY

00:59:42.545 --> 00:59:44.480
WHICH APPEARS TO BE PART OF A

00:59:44.547 --> 00:59:47.216
CONTINUING SERIES OF A VOLLEY IS

00:59:47.283 --> 00:59:49.285
THAT WE WILL BE SEEING --

00:59:49.352 --> 00:59:51.254
COMING FROM WASHINGTON AND IT'S

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:53.022
IT'S VERY SAD --

00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:54.190
WE HAVE --

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:55.725
THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AT

00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:58.828
PROGRAM SB.

00:59:58.895 --> 00:59:59.662
THREE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH DOESN'T

00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:01.097
OFTEN GET TALKED ABOUT BUT WHICH

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:03.399
IS A REALLY FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:06.402
BLOCK OF OUR FUTURE AT HOUSING

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:08.371
AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT WE

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.373
THINK ARE GOING TO IN THE LONG

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:10.907
RUN.

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:12.275
MAKE OUR STATE MORE RESILIENT

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:13.643
AND ALSO.

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.346
REDUCE EMISSIONS --

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:18.614
AS WELL AS OUR RENEWABLE AT

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:20.984
PROGRAMS WHICH WE NOW KIND OF

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.385
TAKE FOR GRANTED BUT WHICH HAVE

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:23.086
INDEED.

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:25.021
REDUCED EMISSIONS AND AND

01:00:25.088 --> 01:00:26.923
CERTAINLY MADE THE ELECTRICITY

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:28.791
SECTOR BY FAR THE LEADER IN

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:30.193
TERMS OF HAVING --

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:31.961
MOVE FORWARD ON ACHIEVING

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:33.763
GREENHOUSE GAS.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.432
GOALS SO --

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:38.801
I I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE

01:00:38.868 --> 01:00:41.304
PROGRAM IS BUILT ON A FOUNDATION

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:43.439
OF DATA THAT WAS DEVELOPED LONG

01:00:43.506 --> 01:00:46.476
BEFORE AB THIRTY TWO EVEN PASSED

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:47.410
THAT.

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:49.212
THE STATE HAD BEGUN COLLECTING

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:51.080
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS DATA

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:53.616
FEEL USE DATA AND THAT WAS USED

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:56.386
IN TURN AS PART OF THE MANDATORY

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:58.054
REPORTING PIECE OF THE WHAT

01:00:58.121 --> 01:01:00.390
BECAME THE CAP AND TRADE RULE.

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:02.825
AND WHICH HAS NEVER REALLY BEEN --

01:01:02.892 --> 01:01:05.428
CONTESTED NOW IT ONLY COVERS THE

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:08.631
MAJOR EMISSIONS SOURCES THAT --

01:01:08.698 --> 01:01:10.833
ARE AT COVERED UNDER THE CAP AND

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.202
TRADE PROGRAM BUT THAT IS A VERY

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:14.904
LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE SOURCES

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:17.040
THAT ARE OUT THERE.

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:19.142
AND WE THINK THAT --

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:21.944
THAT PLUS OF RIGOROUS ANALYSIS

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:25.214
WHICH AS HAS BEEN SUBJECTED --

01:01:25.281 --> 01:01:27.216
TO REVIEW AND AND IS.

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:32.722
SOUGHT INPUT FROM MANY DIFFERENT --

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:35.858
TO IS A GOOD START BUT AGAIN --

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:37.994
WE WANT TO DO AND I THINK WE

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:41.431
NEED TO DO MORE TO DRIVE DOWN

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:43.366
EMISSIONS AT THE SAME TIME TO

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:45.334
KEEP OUR ECONOMY.

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:47.837
OF HUMMING ALONG --

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:51.374
WHENEVER I GET INVOLVED IN --

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.876
HEARING ARE TALKING ABOUT.

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:55.144
THE POTENTIAL.

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:57.580
FOR OVER ALLOCATION IN THE

01:01:57.647 --> 01:02:00.850
MARKET OR THE NEED --

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:02.652
TO USE PRICES MORE AGGRESSIVELY

01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:05.088
THAN WE'RE DOING NOW --

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:08.858
I THINK ABOUT THE YELLOW.

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:10.693
FAST IN PARIS AND I THINK ABOUT

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.728
THE MANY TIMES IN WHICH WE HAVE

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:15.331
BEEN ON THE VERGE OF HEARING

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:17.467
THAT ENERGY PRICES IN CALIFORNIA

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:19.836
WORD GOING TO DRIVE PEOPLE.

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.571
AWAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO

01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:23.706
HARM TO OUR ECONOMY --

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:25.508
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED AND WE'RE

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:26.642
VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:28.744
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE THIS

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:30.646
ARRAY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:33.216
IN A WAY THAT HAS BOTH KEPT US

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:34.484
ON TRACK IN TERMS OF EMISSIONS

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:36.419
REDUCTIONS.

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:39.388
AND NOT DRIVEN ORDINARY PEOPLE

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:41.190
TAKE TO THE STREETS TO COMPLAIN

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.159
ABOUT HOW WE'RE DEPRIVING THEM

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:46.095
OF THE ABILITY TO GET TO WORK --

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:48.564
IF IT IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM AND

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:50.099
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I DON'T

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:51.801
THINK WE'LL EVER ACHIEVE.

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:55.671
THE LEVEL OF PERFECTION THAT --

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:57.340
MIGHT BE DESIRABLE IN TERMS OF

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.475
BEING ABLE TO ANALYZE THE

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:01.344
EFFECTS OF ALL OUR POLICIES IS

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.411
THAT WE LIVE IN A VERY

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:04.347
COMPLICATED ECONOMY CALIFORNIA

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:07.383
HAS A VERY COMPLEX ECONOMY AS WE

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.785
IT REPEATEDLY I TOLD --

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:11.721
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE LIVE IN

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:14.457
A POLITICAL WORLD WHERE WE KNOW

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:14.690
THAT --

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:17.293
THERE ULTIMATELY THE PUBLIC WILL

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.228
ONLY SUPPORT BUT THEY THINK THEY

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:21.230
CAN LIVE WITH AND WE HAVE TO

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.266
CONSTANTLY KEEP ASKING OURSELVES

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:25.201
IF WE'RE MAKING THE PROGRESS

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:26.469
THAT WE HOPE TO MAKE.

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:28.471
RESPONDING TO THE DESIRE THAT WE

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.006
HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC TO ADDRESS

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:31.841
GLOBAL WARMING AND AT THE SAME

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:33.809
TIME NOT DOING IT IN A WAY THAT

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:37.647
MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYBODY.

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:39.348
TO TO GET TO WORK SOUTH.

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:40.917
AT THE FOCUS LOW NOW

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:42.952
INCREASINGLY HAS TO BE ON THE

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:45.888
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BECAUSE AS

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:47.890
YOU HEARD IT ACCOUNTS.

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:49.959
FOR NEARLY HALF OF THE EMISSIONS

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:51.260
AS WELL AS BEING A LEADING CAUSE

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:53.629
OF AIR POLLUTION AND A

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:55.498
CONGESTION AND OTHER PROBLEMS

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:57.200
THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:58.868
THESE EMISSIONS FROM THE SECTOR

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:00.903
ARE RISING DESPITE INCREASES IN

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:03.506
FUEL EFFICIENCY AND VEHICLES AYE

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:06.509
WHICH WILL CONTINUE DESPITE WHAT.

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:08.644
MADE TURNED OUT TO BE A ROLE

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:12.348
THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:15.017
IS ON TRACK TO CONTINUE TO MAKE

01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:17.753
IMPROVEMENTS IN MANY CATEGORIES

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.021
AND AND THEY HAVE TO IF THEY'RE

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:20.356
GOING TO SURVIVE IN A IN A

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:22.291
GLOBAL MARKET --

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:24.560
BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO START

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:26.295
ADDRESSING SERIOUSLY --

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:27.430
HOW COMMUNITIES AND

01:04:27.496 --> 01:04:29.332
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ARE

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.634
PLANNED AND FUNDED AND BUILT?

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:34.170
THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE IT CLEAR

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:36.239
THAT THIS HAS TO INCLUDE LOOKING

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:37.607
AT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN

01:04:37.673 --> 01:04:39.442
TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING.

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:41.477
WE NEED REAL ACCESSIBLE

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:43.479
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.414
LOCATED IN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:47.416
CAN GET TO WORK SCHOOL AND GO

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:48.351
ABOUT THEIR LIVES WITHOUT

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:50.786
SPENDING HOURS IN THEIR CARS.

01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:53.389
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO REALISTICALTERNATIVES.

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:55.424
WERE SLATED TO SPEND MORE THAN

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:56.792
ONE TRILLION DOLLARS UNDER

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:58.427
CURRENT SATE TRANSPORTATION

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:00.029
FUNDING PLANS.

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:02.064
WE SHOULD BE MAKING INVESTMENTS

01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:03.432
THAT WILL INCREASE CLEAN

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:05.568
MOBILITY OPTIONS CLEAN UP IN

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.470
SUPPORT LOW AND ZERO EMISSIONS

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:09.905
MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND GOODS.

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:12.675
AND HELP BUILD COMMUNITIES THAT

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.377
ARE TRULY SUSTAINABLE.

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:16.879
AS INDICATED IN THE SP ONE FIFTY

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:18.614
REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED LAST

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:19.882
NOVEMBER.

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:21.384
WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT A RANGE

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.586
OF WAYS TO CUT SINGLE OCCUPANCY

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:25.788
VEHICLE TRAVEL INCLUDING BY

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:28.257
PILOTING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:29.925
TO INCREASE MOBILITY OPTIONS

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:30.626
ACROSS.

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:33.229
DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNITIES

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:35.097
AND WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:36.899
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO GET

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:39.368
CALIFORNIANS INTO LOW AND ZERO

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:41.304
EMISSION VEHICLES.

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:43.706
WE NEED TO BE PUSHING A RIDE

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.408
CHER COMPANIES LIKE LIFT AND

01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:47.543
UBER TO TRANSITION THEIR FLEETS

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.245
TOWARDS ZERO EMISSIONS.

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:50.780
WE NEED TO B. CHARTING A PATH TO

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:53.382

OF ZERO DIESELS BY.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.087
TWENTY THIRTY SO THAT'S  LOT OF

01:05:58.154 --> 01:05:58.921
WORK -- IN

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:00.523
FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW AND

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:02.391
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WOULD

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:04.493
BE HELPFUL IF WE COULD --

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.064
COLLECT AND AND ANALYZE ALL OF

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.632
THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE IN

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:13.369
THIS AREA AND TO BE COMMIT

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:15.338
OURSELVES TO FINDING MORE

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:17.306
EFFECTIVE WAYS TO ACHIEVE

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:18.374
RESULTS.

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:19.575
IN ADDITION THE TRANSPORTATION

THIRTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:25.247
TARGETS IS GONNA RQUIRE GREATER

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:27.717
SUSTAINED ACTION ACROSS THE

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:29.485
ENTIRE ECONOMY.

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:30.986
WHILE THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR

01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:32.488
HAS MADE HUGE STRIDES WE NEED TO

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:34.457
CONTINUE TO STAY ON TRACK

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:36.292
TOWARDS ARE 1100% RENEWABLE

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:37.460
ENERGY GOAL.

01:06:37.526 --> 01:06:39.095
AND CONTINUE PUSHING AHEAD ON

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:41.097
ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLEAN

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.732
ENERGY STORAGE WE NEED TO BE

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:44.333
DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.435
STRATEGIES TO DE CARBONIZED OUR

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:46.969
BUILDINGS.

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:49.438
WE NEED TO BE A TURNING TO OUR

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:51.273
NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS LIKE

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.510
FORESTS AND FARMS AND TURNING

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:56.278
THEM INTO EMISSIONS THINKS.

01:06:56.345 --> 01:06:57.980
THAT WILL SUCK CARBON OUT OF THE

01:06:58.047 --> 01:06:59.382
ATMOSPHERE.

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:00.416
WE NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTING

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:01.917
STRATEGIES THAT WILL BOTH CAUGHT

01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:04.520
FIRE RISKS AND UTILIZE BIOMASS

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:06.255
RESOURCES FROM OUR FORESTS AND

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:09.125
WORKING LANDS IN INNOVATIVE WAYS.

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:10.226
LIKE LOW CARBON FUELS AND

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:12.328
PRODUCTS THAT WILL PROVIDE A

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.196
REAL AND LASTING ECONOMIC

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:16.899
OPPORTUNITIES IN RURAL

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:18.200
COMMUNITIES.

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:19.135
WE NEED TO KEEP SLASHING

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.070
EMISSIONS OF THE MOST POTENT AND

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:22.905
FAST ACTING SUPER POLLUTANTS

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:24.874
LIKE METHANE BLACK CARBON.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.309
AND HYDROPHOBIC HYDROCHLORIC

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:28.377
CARBONS AND WE HAVE TO KEEP

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:29.879
INVESTING IN THE KINDS OF

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.747
RESEARCH AND INNOVATION THAT

01:07:31.814 --> 01:07:33.215
WILL SPAWN THE NEXT GENERATION

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:34.884
OF CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE'RE

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.620
GOING TO NEED. TO DE CARBONIZED

01:07:37.686 --> 01:07:39.288
ALL OF THESE THINGS --

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:41.323
WE BELIEVE ARE WITHIN THE

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:44.293
POSSIBILITY AND INDEED WILL BE

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.095
INTERESTING AND I MEAN

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:49.498
INTERESTING AND THE MOST HEY --

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.100
FOR US TO BE ENGAGED IN AND

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:52.635
PEOPLE LOOK TO CALIFORNIA TO

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:55.004
COME UP WITH INNOVATIVE IDEAS IN

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:57.173
THESE IN THESE AREAS --

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:59.375
FINALLY OF COURSE WHAT WE DO

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:01.377
HERE IS ONLY A SMALL PART OF

01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:02.511
GLOBAL EMISSIONS.

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:04.413
BUT WE RECOGNIZE IS A CRITICAL

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.249
PART OF THE GLOBAL ACTION NEEDED

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:09.785
SO AS WE TURN UP THE DIAL HERE

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:11.153
WE ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.655
WORKING WITH PARTNERS IN OTHER

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:14.590
STATES PROVINCES AND COUNTRIES

01:08:14.657 --> 01:08:16.025
AROUND THE WORLD.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:18.327
WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATORS

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:19.962
WHO HAVE MADE THE TREK TO

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:22.965
GLAMOROUS PLACES LIKE KATOWICE

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:25.134
AS WITH THIS TOO AS WELL AS TWO

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:25.935
OTHER.

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:27.870
POINTS AROUND THE GLOBE --

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:29.505
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT I THINK

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:31.240
THAT WE CONTINUE --

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:34.009
TO AT PAY ATTENTION TO HOW ARE

01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:35.945
PROGRAMS ARE BEING INTERPRETED

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:39.348
AND TAKEN UP BY OTHER PEOPLE AND

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:40.182
WE NEED.

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:42.351
TO BE OUT REPORTING BACK TO YOU

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:43.486
AND TO THE PUBLIC ON SOME OF

01:08:43.552 --> 01:08:43.686
THAT.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:45.054
COLLABORATING WITH OTHER

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.289
JURISDICTIONS REALLY CAN HELP US

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:49.925
TO COST EFFECTIVELY SCALE LOW IN

01:08:49.992 --> 01:08:51.594
ZERO CARBON TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.330
CAN UTILIZE TO CUT EMISSIONS

01:08:54.396 --> 01:08:55.431
HERE AND THAT WILL HELP US TO

01:08:55.498 --> 01:08:58.400
TRANSITION. TO A CLEAN ENERGY

01:08:58.467 --> 01:08:59.735
ECONOMY SO.

01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:02.271
NO WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR MORE

01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:04.373
THAN A DECADE --

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.443
AND THE ADMINISTRATION OBVIOUSLY

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:09.211
BUT ALSO LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:11.013
AGENCIES AND BUSINESSES AND

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.616
ORGANIZATIONS AND CITIZENS UP

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:15.284
AND DOWN THE STATE WHO HAVE COME

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:17.419
FORWARD WITH SOLUTIONS AND

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:18.487
PARTICIPATED.

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:20.456
IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT KINDS

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:22.892
OF ACTIVITIES AND WORKSHOPS

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:25.327
AIMED AT PROMOTING --

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:28.998
LOWER CARBON LIFE IN CALFORNIA --

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:30.232
IT'S DELIVERED A RANGE OF

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:31.433
BENEFITS BEYOND JUST THE

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.402
REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:34.837
EMISSIONS --

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:37.039
BUT AGAIN THERE'S MORE TO BE

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:38.274
DONE SO --

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.276
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:42.444
COLLABORATING WITH YOU AND WITH

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:43.612
THAT I THINK I'LL JUST.

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.981
ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU

01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:48.250
MAY HAVE FOR ME.

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:49.618
I HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:54.356
YOU COULD ASK ME RIGHT HERE.

01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:58.027
WE WE WE GET A COPY THAT --

01:09:58.093 --> 01:09:59.061
AS FEDERAL CASKEY.

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:00.129
I WANT TO GO BACK AND REVISIT

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:02.231
THE ORDINARY PEOPLE YELLOW FESS

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:04.400
OUTRAGE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN I

01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:05.668
GOT ELECTED IN.

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:07.002
TWENTY TEN THE PRICE OF GASOLINE

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:08.871
IN CALIFORNIA WAS. THREE DOLLARS

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:10.539
AND EIGHTY CENTS A GALLON.

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:14.443
IT'S TO THE WE'VE DONE SB ONE

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.245
THAT INCREASE THE PRICE OF

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:17.980
GASOLINE WITHIN CAP AND TRADE

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:19.982
THE SKY WAS GONNA FALL AND

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.484
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:25.087
ALL OVER THE OPINION THAT THAT

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:28.490
IF WE HAD A ANOTHER CARBON TAX

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:30.025
AND OIL SEVERANCE TAXES SOME.

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:32.361
A SUCH THAT THE ORDINARY MARKETS

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:36.265
SPREAD THAT PRICE AROUND IT'S

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:37.933
NOT JUST CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.835
THE UNITED STATES ITS MORNING

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.470
THE CATION OF WHAT HAPPENS

01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:43.372
DESTRUCTIVELY IN VENEZUELA OR

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:44.239
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:45.608
IF WITH THE WITH THE SAUDIS

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:48.444
VERSES YOU KNOW OUR WELL MEANING

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.412
PROGRAMS DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:50.646
ABOUT.

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:52.948
THE SKY IS FALLING AND AND THIS

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:55.150
THE THE SORT RELATIVELY STABLE

01:10:55.217 --> 01:10:56.652
PRICE OF THE FUEL IN THE LAST

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:59.154
DECADE WELL IT CERTAINLY IF YOU

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:00.389
WERE LOOK --

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:03.058
ACROSS TEN YEARS THE PRICE HAS

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:04.593
BEEN RELATIVELY STABLE IF YOU

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.395
LOOK ON A WEEK TO WEEK OR MONTH

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.263
TO MONTH BASIS IT GOES UP AND

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:10.833
DOWN A LOT AND CALIFORNIA IS.

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:12.935
KNOWN FOR HAVING EVEN SOMEWHAT

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:15.537
MORE VOLATILE GASOLINE PRICES

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:17.673
THAN OTHER PLACES DO BECAUSE WE

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.341
HAVE SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:21.410
PLANS THAT ARE SOLD IN

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:23.012
CALIFORNIA --

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:25.314
IN A IDEA I NO LONGER GO TO A

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:27.116
GAS STATION I'M HAPPY TO SAY AS

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:29.018
I WAS ABLE --

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:31.420
TO BUT MYSELF INTO A OF ELECTRIC

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:34.256
VEHICLES NOT TOO LONG AGO BUT I

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:36.392
DO HEAR A LOT FROM PEOPLE ABOUT

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.160
THE PRICE OF GASOLINE AND I KNOW

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:39.061
THAT.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.363
WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.098
SEES A SPIKE IN GASOLINE?

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:48.170
PEOPLE REACT AND THERE'S DOWN

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:49.772
FOR MAINTENANCE OR THERE'S SOME

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:51.473
DISRUPTIVE WEATHER EVENT THAT

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.375
CAUSES THE PRICES TO GO UP BY

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:54.309
MORE THAN A PENNY OR TWO A

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:55.244
GALLON.

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:57.346
SOMETIMES EVEN AT THAT LEVEL YOU

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:59.081
YOU HEAR A PUBLIC RESPONSE NOW

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:01.950
IT LEVELS OFF GENERALLY AND IT

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:04.653
HAS SO YOU KNOW AFTER WE'VE AB

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.789
YELLED AFTER TAT MEDIA DESIRE

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:08.157
TO DO SOMETHING AND AFTER YOU

01:12:08.223 --> 01:12:09.725
APPOINT A COMMITTEE TO SEE

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:10.492
WHETHER THERE WAS.

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:13.328
ANY TRUST VIOLATION OR OTHER OF

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:15.397
MANIPULATION IN THE MARKET IT

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:17.366
USUALLY TURNS OUT THAT --

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:18.767
PRICES YOU KNOW HAVE SETTLED

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:20.369
BACK DOWN AGAIN AND NOTHING

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:22.805
HORRIBLE HAS HAPPENED --

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:24.807
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:26.942
OF THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY IN

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.378
CALIFORNIA THAT IS A WHOLE

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:30.345
CONVERSATION THAT --

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:32.381
AS YOU WELL KNOW --

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:33.882
THERE'S A STRONG.

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:36.418
MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:37.186
SEE -- OIL

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:40.389
PRODUCTIONAND REFINING --

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:43.092
PHASED OUT OR BAND AND OUR STATE --

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:45.360
THERE'S ALSO PEOPLE WHO.

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:48.263
FEEL THAT --

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:51.100
LIVING NEAR.

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:54.570
TO A BURDEN ON LOW INCOME

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.305
COMMUNITIES THAT SUFFER

01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:58.307
OFTENTIMES FROM WORST AIR

01:12:58.373 --> 01:12:59.274
POLLUTION THAN OTHER PARTS OF

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:01.110
THE STATE SO IT BECOMES AN

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:03.045
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE AS

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:06.749
WELL. FOR THE PAST YEARS --

01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:09.485
I THINK WE'VE BEEN OPERATING

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:12.621
UNDER A POLICY OF TRYING TO

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:16.024
REDUCE DEMAND AS A WAY TO REDUCE

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:18.360
THE IMPACT OF OIL PRODUCTION AND

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:20.863
OIL ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA.

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:22.998
BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE COULD GET

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.400
TO A POINT WHERE WE HAD ACHIEVED

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:27.236
OUR ZERO EMISSION GOALS.

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:28.504
AND THEY WOULD STILL BE AN OIL

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:30.105
AND GAS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:32.474
BECAUSE WE HAVE WE HAVE THE

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:34.443
RESOURCES AND WE HAVE THE

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:36.245
REFINING CAPACITY HERE.

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:38.413
AND THEY WOULD SELL THE PRODUCT

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.649
IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE ITSELF

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:42.451
THE LEGITIMATE COMMERCIAL

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:44.186
ACTIVITY RIGHT --

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:46.388
IS SO IF WE ARE GOING TO BE

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:47.823
THINKING ABOUT THAT.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:50.959
WHOLE SECTOR IT DESERVES TO BE

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:52.227
THOUGHT ABOUT IN A IN A MORE

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:54.196
COMPREHENSIVE WAY I THINK THAT'S

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:55.864
A LONG ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:58.400
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT --

01:13:58.467 --> 01:13:59.968
YES THERE PROBABLY IS ROOM TO

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:01.537
RAISE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE TO

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:05.340
CONSUMERS BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE

01:14:05.407 --> 01:14:07.042
SOMETHING THAT'S DONE VERY

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:10.379
THOUGHTFULLY AND CAREFULLY.

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:12.347
GOT A I GUESS THE THE FOCUS WILL

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:14.349
BE ON THIS MEDIUM TERM GOAL OF

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:16.418
TRYING TO REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:18.821
AND AND WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBERS

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:19.755
THAT YOU'VE RELEASED ABOUT THE

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:21.990
INCREASED VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:23.659
AND POLLUTION GOING UP IN THIS

01:14:23.725 --> 01:14:25.561
SECTOR WIENER UNDERSTAND PEOPLE

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:26.895
ARE WORK AND THEY'RE ALL ALL.

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:27.963
THESE OTHER THINGS AND AT THE

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:31.667
WHAT'S ANOTHER MARK THE SENT.

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:33.468
I'M YOU INDICATED --

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:35.470
THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRE TO HAVE

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:36.471
THAT NEXUS BETWEEN

01:14:36.538 --> 01:14:37.606
TRANSPORTATION HOUSING AND I

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:40.509
THINK WE'VE DONE THAT IN THE CAP

01:14:40.576 --> 01:14:40.943
AND TRADE PROGRAM.

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:43.345
PEOPLE CONTINUE TO FORGET THAT

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:45.547
THE 35% OF THE MONEY GOES TO

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:48.217
HOUSING OR TRANSIT OR RAIL

01:14:48.283 --> 01:14:49.685
CONNECTIONS AND OF THE 60%

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:52.421
THAT'S DESIGNATED YOU KNOW IF IF

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:54.456
THE WHITE HOUSE KEENLY THREE

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:54.823
POINT.

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:55.691
TWO OPTION NUMBER IS CORRECT

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:57.459
THAT'S OVER A BILLION ONE THAT

01:14:57.526 --> 01:14:58.493
GOES TO HOUSING AND

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.096
TRANSPORTATION.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.931
GOING TO THE LEGISLATURE'S 40%

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:05.534
DISCRETIONARY FUNDS IS THAT DO

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:07.402
YOU THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:11.907
MORE IN THAT MEDIUM VERSUS THE

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:14.176
OTHER WE'LL GET TO THE CLERK AT

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:14.910
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:17.045
ALL THE OTHER --

01:15:17.112 --> 01:15:18.981
PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE WE'VE BEEN

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:21.216
IS FUNDING IN THE END OF THIS

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:23.452
YEAR'S WELL --

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:24.853
IDEA I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:29.224
BUDGET PRESENTS A PRETTY CLEAR --

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:31.126
VIEW OF HOW HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:32.828
THOSE FUNDS ALLOCATE THIS I'M

01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:33.962
NOT GONNA TRY.

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:36.265
TO REDO THAT HERE --

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:38.400
BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT --

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:41.203
FROM CARBS PERSPECTIVE THE NEED

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:44.339
TO CONTINUE TO TURN OVER THE

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:45.407
FLEETS.

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:49.778
OF BOTH LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE THE

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:52.214
TRANSPORT SECTOR OF A HEAVY DUTY

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:54.616
VEHICLES OUT REMAINS VERY HIGH

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:58.353
ON THE LIST OF SHORT AND MEDIUM

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:00.689
TERM THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE --

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:03.392
BECAUSE THOSE VEHICLES IN THE

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:05.260
MARKET ARE GONNA BE USED ALL THE

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:07.930
TIME OF WHETHER IT'S A LIFT OR

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:09.598
pTAKING.

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:11.199
GOODS FROM OUR PORTER THE

01:16:11.266 --> 01:16:13.568
AIRPORT AND DISTRIBUTING THEM TO

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:16.004
PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY --

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:17.539
THESE VEHICLES US STAY ON THE

01:16:17.606 --> 01:16:21.243
ROAD FOR DECADES AND THEY ARE

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:23.045
BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY LARGE

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:26.548
SHARE OF OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AS

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:28.083
WELL AS OUR AIR POLLUTION

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:29.885
PROBLEMS SO --

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:31.653
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SAY --

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.155
WE'VE SPENT TOO MUCH ON THOSE

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:34.957
TYPES OF PROGRAMS IN FACT I

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:36.458
THINK WE'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:39.528
JOB OF CREATING A MIXOF OF

01:16:39.594 --> 01:16:42.497
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FUNDING

01:16:42.564 --> 01:16:44.166
NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE.

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:47.202
CONTINUING TO BE A TO APPEAR ON

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:49.438
THE SCENE AND ALSO --

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:51.340
MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR FLAYED

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:53.775
SEND AN INDIVIDUALS TO TO

01:16:53.842 --> 01:16:55.010
PURCHASE THESE CLEANER VEHICLES

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:58.313
A HOUSING PROBLEM HOWEVER AND

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:01.750
DEALING WITH CALIFORNIA'S --

01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:03.118
CHRONIC SHORTAGE OF HOUSING CAP

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:05.554
AND TRADE AN APPROPRIATE SOURCE

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:10.258
OF BUT MY UNDER IT'S NOT THE

01:17:10.325 --> 01:17:11.026
ONLY --

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:13.028
SOURCE THAT OF PEOPLE CAT OR

01:17:13.095 --> 01:17:14.529
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT NEXUS

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:16.331
BETWEEN GREENHOUSE GAS

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:17.265
REDUCTIONS AND WE GETTING ON

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:20.535
LET'S GO TO I HAD BEFORE GOING

01:17:20.602 --> 01:17:23.105
TO THE COP. TWENTY FOR IN A CUT

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:25.007
OF PIZZA I WAS IN NORWAY AND I

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:28.643
ACTUALLY WENT TO A WASTE

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.679
GENERATION --

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:32.914
INCINERATION PLANT THAT WAS

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:35.317
PUTTING ON A CARBON

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:37.419
SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON CAPTURE

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.354
MANDATE THERE NO WE CHANGED OUR

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:40.622
BUILDING YOU KNOW IT'S THIS IS

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:41.690
ONE OF THE UNTHINKABLE CERTAIN

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:42.657
TALK BULLS AND CALIFORNIA

01:17:42.724 --> 01:17:45.460
TALKING ABOUT CONSIDERATION.

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:47.529
BUT I ACTUALLY DID IT AT THAT

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:50.032
CHAIRMAN ALLEN'S FIRST --

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:51.199
MEETING IN EQ.

01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:52.067
WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL CALIFORNIA

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:53.135
THIS IS A ONE OF THESE THINGS

01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:54.603
THAT PEOPLE WILL SAY GIVEN THE

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:57.472
TECHNOLOGY AND GIVEN OUR DESIRE

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:59.574
TO SHOW THE WORLD HOW WE CAN DO

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:01.510
THAT WE JUST SIT AND LESS.

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:04.146
LET OUR LANDFILLS ROCKED AND AND

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:06.748
LET THINGS TO DISINTEGRATE AND

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.550
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT EVEN WITH

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.519
THE BEST RECYCLING PROGRAMS THAT

01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:12.821
WE HAVE ALL THE MONEY ALL THE

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:16.591
ALL THE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:17.659
EMISSIONS THAT ARE TURN.

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:19.194
OCCURRING AT OUR LANDFILLS RIGHT

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:21.696
NOW AND IF THAT'S A IS

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:23.298
APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT.

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:25.067
AGAIN TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:26.401
THEY SHOULD BE DOING THAT ALSO.

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:28.070
SO CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY DOES A

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:29.871
PRETTY GOOD JOB OF CAPTURING THE

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:32.774
METHANE FROM OUR LANDFILLS --

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:35.610
WE DON'T ALWAYS RE UTILIZE IT IN

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:37.546
A WAY THAT SAYS --

01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:39.481
PROGRESSIVE OR IS AB.

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.683
AS CLEAN AS IT MIGHT BE AND WE

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:43.452
DO NEED TO DEMONSTRATE OTHER

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:46.521
THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH METHANE.

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:47.756
I IN GENERAL BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:51.326
LOT OF IT OUT MENTIONED EARLIER

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:53.328
FROM NOT JUST THE LANDFILLS BUT

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:53.728
FROM --

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:55.764
TREES AND OTHER VEGETATION

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:57.599
THAT'S ARRIVING ON ON LAND AND

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:59.568
SO FORTH AND PUTTING THAT TO

01:18:59.634 --> 01:19:01.470
WORK IN A IN A WAY THAT WILL

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:02.370
GENERATE --

01:19:02.437 --> 01:19:04.806
JOBS AND GENERATE PRODUCTS IS A

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.775
VERY HIGH PRIORITY --

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:07.876
IN THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

01:19:07.943 --> 01:19:10.679
POLLUTANTS PLAN THAT INCLUDES --

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:13.115
DERRY DIED JESTERS AND USING THE

01:19:13.181 --> 01:19:16.451
POTENTIAL FOR USING THE GAS

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:19.421
THAT'S GENERATED FROM THOSE --

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:22.057
TO POWER AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT

01:19:22.124 --> 01:19:23.325
AS YOU KNOW JUST BEGINNING TO

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:24.526
REALLY BE.

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.895
INVESTIGATED AND AS I MENTIONED

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:28.396
IN MY REMARKS --

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:30.665
WE SEE THIS AS AN AREA.

01:19:30.732 --> 01:19:32.634
FOR RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:34.136
THAT HAS A LOT OF BENEFITS

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:35.570
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:38.206
THE TECHNOLOGY FOR GETTING

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:41.376
CARBON OUT OF THE AIR IS STILL

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:44.279
PRETTY MUCH IN THE R. D. AND D.

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:46.414
STAGE THERE ARE COMPETING IDEAS

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:47.549
OUT THERE THEIR PRODUCTS THAT

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:51.520
PEOPLE ARE ARE WORKING ON AND

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:51.920
OUT WE SHOULD BE.

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:54.656
TAKING IT NG DEMONSTRATION ON

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:58.860
THESE ARE AT THE END OF IN

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:00.896
CALIFORNIA WHICH WE HAVE NOT

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:02.430
PAID AS MUCH ATTENTION TO BUT

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:04.399
MANUFACTURING WHETHER IT'S CLASS

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.701
PLANTS OR CEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:09.304
PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:11.306
DEMONSTRATING A WAYS IN WHICH

01:20:11.373 --> 01:20:14.309
YOU COULD CAPTURE AND RE USE --

01:20:14.376 --> 01:20:16.711
CARBON FOR BENEFICIAL PURPOSES

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:19.414
THE IS A REALLY HOT AREA --

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:20.949
FOR ENTREPRENEURS AND AND

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:23.685
INVENTORS RIGHT NOW AND AND

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:25.921
HOPEFULLY WE CAN HELP PROVIDE

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:26.121
SOME.

01:20:26.188 --> 01:20:28.390
OF THE PLACES WHERE WE CAN TEST

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:29.391
THESE THINGS OUT.

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:30.892
IN AND ONE FINAL QUESTION ON OUR

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:32.527
ACHIEVING THE SB THIRTY TWO

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:35.497
GOALS WE'VE TALKED PREVIOUSLY

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:37.365
ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:38.500
HAVE TO PROVIDE A SMOOTH

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:39.301
TRANSITION.

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:40.502
YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT WE DIDN'T

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:41.570
WANT TO YOU KNOW NOT

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:43.905
WITHSTANDING SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:44.806
WHICH WITH THE SET.

01:20:44.873 --> 01:20:47.242
RAILS AND AND AND AND CAPS

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:49.344
PUTTING PUTTING THAT ASIDE FOR A

01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:50.545
MINUTE.

01:20:50.612 --> 01:20:52.747
WE ALWAYS NEED TO READJUST.

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:56.351
OUR NUMBERS GIVEN THE NEW IF

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:59.421
RICE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:01.923
USED TO SAY NOW WHAT DO YOU DO

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:06.494
WE LOOK AT THE THE IF WE SET A

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:08.863
INCREASE A FLOOR EARLIER THAT --

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:11.032
RATHER THAN LATER WHEN IT SEEMS

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:12.500
LIKE WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:13.935
THAT SEEMS TO SEND THE SIGNAL TO

01:21:14.002 --> 01:21:15.170
THE MARKET OF A SMOOTHER

01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:17.138
TRANSITION THE PAIN IS COMING

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:19.174
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SPREAD OUT

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:20.709
OVER A DECADE VERSES.

01:21:20.775 --> 01:21:22.344
THE LAST YEAR'S WHAT IS YOUR

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:23.778
THINKING ON THAT AS WE'VE GOTTEN

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:25.146
THESE NEW NUMBERS HAVE COME IN

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:27.015
AND STAFF THIS WONDERFUL JOB

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:27.415
SAYING.

01:21:27.482 --> 01:21:29.551
NOT ALWAYS QUANTIFIABLE RIGHT

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:30.819
MMHM.

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:31.953
OF WELL IT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.555
WE ARE STUDYING AS PART OF

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:35.056
PUTTING TOGETHER THE NEXT

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:37.058
SCOPING PLAN --

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:40.295
WE HAVE NOT COME UP WITH ANY --

01:21:40.362 --> 01:21:41.963
DEFINITIVE --

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:43.265
RESPONSE YET --

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:44.432
TO BUT WE'RE ALSO NOT SAYING THE

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:46.034
PROGRAM IS PERFECT AS IT IS AND

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:48.637
SHOULD CONTINUE THAT EVER HAVING

01:21:48.703 --> 01:21:50.038
ANY CHANGES MADE IT AND I THINK

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:50.972
WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:52.941
LOOKING AT TO ANNUAL.

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:55.010
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAM'S

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.211
OPERATION.

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:58.246
NO MATTER WHAT --

01:21:58.313 --> 01:22:01.316
IN TERMS OF MAKING AND ON A

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:03.752
PERCENTAGE BASIS YOU KNOW X.

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:05.253
AMOUNT OF THE REDUCTION SHOULD

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.554
COME FROM THE CAP AND TRADE

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:08.590
PROGRAM VERSUS WHATEVER.

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:11.660
IT IS OF YOU KNOW AT THE MOMENT --

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:13.461
IS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT AS A

01:22:13.528 --> 01:22:14.829
POLICY.

01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:16.798
COULD BE DONE I THINK WHAT WE

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:18.433
NEED TO DO IS TO LOOK AT IT IN

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.435
THE CONTEXT OF THIS MIX OF

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:22.504
MEASURES AND INCENTIVES THAT I

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:24.939
WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER TO TRY.

01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:28.343
TO KEEP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE --

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.712
TO A TO A PROGRAM WHERE WE CAN

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:32.347
GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO WITH

01:22:32.414 --> 01:22:35.016
MINIMUM COST AND MAXIMUM.

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:36.418
SIDE BENEFITS I MEAN THAT'S WHAT

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:37.252
ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:39.487
RIGHT BUT I DON'T THINK WE KNOW

01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:41.756
YET WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER AS TO

01:22:41.823 --> 01:22:43.358
ACHIEVING THAT PERFECT MIX THAT

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:44.559
THE ALTERNATIVE IS JUST.

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:46.227
IF WITH IF IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.095
WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND THIS

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:48.930
IS THE PURPOSE OF THE HEARING IS

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:49.998
TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THEN

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:51.833
WE'RE STUCK WITH COMMAND CONTROL.

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.401
THAN THAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:54.836
ALTERNATIVE A THEN YOU REALLY

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:55.970
DON'T LIKE A ALTERNATIVE BE IF

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:58.073
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DESTRUCTIVE.

01:22:58.139 --> 01:22:59.774
TO THE BUSINESSES AND SAYING YOU

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:02.377
THOU SHALL DO THAT SO THAT'S

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:04.646
YOUR CHARGE AS CHAIR.

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:08.249
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:09.384
THANK YOU MISTER FOR THE

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:10.885

AND I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:23:11.453 --> 01:23:13.221
RECOGNITION THAT --

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:16.257
SPIKES AND GASOLINE PRICES CAN

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:17.392
PROVOKE.

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:19.794
A LOT OF ANGER AND I A REPRESENT

01:23:19.861 --> 01:23:20.395
A LOT OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:23.064
THE EASTERN.

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:23.865
WHEN WE SEE THESE PRICE

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:26.935
INCREASES PEOPLE GET TAKE OFF

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:27.569
AND -- THE

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:29.137
VOLUME OF EMAILS AND TELEPHONE

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:30.972
CALLS TO OFFICE --

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:34.309
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE --

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:35.543
YOU KNOW.

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:36.678
IT WAS MENTIONED THAT --

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:37.879
IN A CALIFORNIA CAN'T DO IT

01:23:37.946 --> 01:23:39.681
ALONE YOU KNOW WE CAN CONTROL

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:42.317
ABOUT 1% OF THE EMISSIONS

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:44.386
CONTROLS OF OF THE GLOBE WE NEED

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:46.421
WE NEED COOPERATION FROM FROM

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:48.423
OTHER COUNTRIES --

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:49.391
BUT IT'S BEEN SHOWN TO OUR

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:50.925
POLICIES THAT.

01:23:50.992 --> 01:23:53.027
THE COST OF FUEL ELECTRICITY AND

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:54.629
HOUSING TRANSPORTATION CAN BE

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:57.298
IMPACTED.

01:23:57.365 --> 01:23:58.466
STATE SENATOR --

01:23:58.533 --> 01:23:59.667
ACOSTA USED --

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:00.869
ASSERTION THAT THE PRICE OF

01:24:00.935 --> 01:24:02.070
GASOLINE HASN'T --

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:03.371
INCREASED --

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:04.439
SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST TEN

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:05.407
YEARS IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRICE

01:24:05.473 --> 01:24:07.442
AND MAYBE EVEN AT AND FACTOR

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:09.144
INFLATION BUT WE DON'T TAKE INTO

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:11.880
CONSIDERATION IS --

01:24:11.946 --> 01:24:13.348
SUPPLY AND DEMAND --

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:16.117
WE ARE NOW A OIL EXPORTER

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:17.652
MONAURAL IMPORTER AND A LOT OF

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.254
IT HAS TO DO BECAUSE OF FRACKING

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.789
NOT ONLY WITHIN CITY CALIFORNIA

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:22.524
BUT THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:23.691
THE COUNTRY --

01:24:23.758 --> 01:24:27.395
PARTICULAR THE WESTERN STATES --

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:29.431
BUT WE HAVE SEEN --

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:30.532
PROBLEMS IN IN OTHER COUNTRIES

01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:32.667
ONTARIO CANADA WHICH I THINK YOU

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:33.301
MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE TOO A LITTLE

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:34.669
BIT THAT --

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:35.637
THEY WITHDREW FROM THE CAPITATE

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:37.739
PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE THE

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:38.506
NEGATIVE PUBLIC PRESSURE AND WE

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:41.042
SEE AN AWESOME VIOLENT PROTESTS

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:42.143
AND IN FRANCE.

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:46.915
AS A RESULT OF HIGHER PRICES --

01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:48.483
WHILE OUR CITIZENS IN CALIFORNIA

01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:50.118
HAVE AND MARCHED IN THE STREETS

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:52.020
BECAUSE OF HIGH ENERGY.

01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:53.021
COSTS WE HAVE SOME OF THE

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:54.189
HIGHEST ENERGY COSTS AND IN THE

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:57.425
COUNTRY AND 53% OF THE CITIZENS

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:58.660
IN A RECENT POLL JUST SAID THAT

01:24:58.726 --> 01:24:59.727
THEY ARE CONSIDERING.

01:24:59.794 --> 01:25:00.895
LEAVING CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:03.565
COST OF LIVING HERE IS.

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:07.302
IS SO EXPENSIVE SO --

01:25:07.368 --> 01:25:10.371
WHILE WE SET A GOOD EXAMPLE HERE

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:12.140
AND UNDER UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:13.775
YOU YOU HAVE BEEN --

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:16.678
TAKING AB THIRTY TO SB.

01:25:16.744 --> 01:25:17.545
THIRTY TWO TO THE AT THE PROPER

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:18.880
LEVELS AND WERE SAYING THE

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:19.614
OPTIONS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:21.483
SUCCESSFUL --

01:25:21.549 --> 01:25:24.152
HOW DO WE COMBAT THESE OTHER?

01:25:24.219 --> 01:25:25.787
COUNTRIES AND SEE THESE HIGHER

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:27.922
COSTS AND ARE TAKING A STEP BACK

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:30.058
AS WE ATTEMPT.

01:25:30.124 --> 01:25:35.029
TO HARMONIZE THE THE WORLD --

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:36.531
THAT'S A BIG AND COMPLICATED

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:38.233
QUESTION AND I'M.

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:39.801
NOT GONNA TRY TO ANSWER FOR

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:41.436
EVERY PLACE BUT ONE THING I

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:42.837
WOULD SAY IS THAT.

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:44.873
I THINK YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:46.407
THAT --

01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:49.677
ENERGY MANDATE AND IT IS GOING

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:51.513
TO CONTINUE AND AND AND THAT'S A

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:53.348
GOOD THING THAT AS OUR STANDARDS

01:25:53.414 --> 01:25:54.616
OF LIVING CONTINUE TO RISE

01:25:54.682 --> 01:25:55.850
AROUND THE GLOBE.

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:57.552
PEOPLE WANT WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS

01:25:57.619 --> 01:26:00.421
COUNTRY IN TERMS OF APPLIANCES

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:03.591
AND AIR CONDITIONING AND IN

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:04.959
THEIR MANY PLACES IN THE WORLD

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:05.760
THAT.

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.195
WON'T BE LIVEABLE --

01:26:07.262 --> 01:26:10.565
WITHOUT SOME OF THESE BENEFITS --

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:14.302
CALIFORNIA CAN BE A NET EXPORTER

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:16.471
OF SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT

01:26:16.538 --> 01:26:18.706
WILL ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:20.708
IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT INCREASE

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:23.344
EMISSIONS AND HOPEFULLY ALLOWS

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:27.348
US TO YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO EXIST --

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:29.551
IN.

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:30.552
LITIF SAFETY --

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:32.754
AS A PLAN AT AND SO THAT'S THE

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.522
TASK I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:38.226
LOOKING AT IT'S A IT'S A MORE.

01:26:38.293 --> 01:26:40.261
COMPLICATED IN SOME WAYS BUT IT

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:41.896
ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT DIFFERENT

01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:43.665
PLACES A START FROM DIFFERENT

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:45.767
STARTING POINTS AND THEY ALSO

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:48.036
HAVE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:50.638
REDUCE EMISSIONS AS YOU GO ALONG

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:52.874
THAT THERE ARE PLACES NOW WHERE --

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:54.475
FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW SOLAR

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:57.178
ENERGY ISN'T BEING UTILIZED AT

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:59.480
ALL BUT COULD BE USED IN A VERY

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:01.382
COST EFFECTIVE WAY.

01:27:01.449 --> 01:27:03.451
AND WHERE PEOPLE ARE ONLY JUST

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:04.953
BEGINNING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:27:05.019 --> 01:27:06.588
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT'S OUT

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:09.357
THERE NOT EVERY PART OF THE

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:11.125
GLOBE AT CAN OR SHOULD.

01:27:11.192 --> 01:27:14.329
DEVELOP IN THE WAY THAT WE DID

01:27:14.395 --> 01:27:16.097
STATE AND AS A COUNTRY WE WERE

01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:17.465
BLESSED WITH ALL THESE.

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:19.801
RESERVES OF COAL AND OIL THAT

01:27:19.867 --> 01:27:22.403
OTHER PEOPLE JUST DON'T HALF AND

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:25.707
SO OUT WE'RE KIND OF NOW GOING

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:27.609
BACK AND RE INVENTING SOME OF

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:29.210
THESE --

01:27:29.277 --> 01:27:30.678
IDEAS AND AND WERE IN IN A

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:32.914
POSITION WHERE WE CAN BE HELPFUL

01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:35.383
TO OTHER PLACES AND NOT JUST OUT

01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:37.185
OF THE GOODNESS OF OUR HEART BUT

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:39.287
OUT OF SELF INTEREST BECAUSE OUR

01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:40.555
ECONOMY WILL.

01:27:40.622 --> 01:27:43.558
BENEFIT IF OTHERS ARE ABLE TO

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:45.393
USE SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.295
AS WELL SO --

01:27:47.362 --> 01:27:49.931
I I SEE THIS PROGRAM IS A AS

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:51.466
POTENTIALLY.

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:55.203
A WINNER FOR CALIFORNIA'S DESIRE

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:57.338
TO ATTRACT THE BEST AND THE

01:27:57.405 --> 01:27:59.874
BRIGHTEST OF ENTREPRENEURS AND

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.275
IT DOES CNTINUE ON THE PATH

01:28:01.342 --> 01:28:02.744
THAT WE'VE BEEN ON FOR ALL THESE

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:05.546
YEARS OF EXPORTING OUR AT

01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:11.386
UNIVERSITY YOU KNOW TOP THE TOP --

01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:13.955
EXPORTS IN THE IN THE WORLD AND

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:16.257
HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT

01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:18.226
AS YOU SAY PUTTING TOO MUCH OF A

01:28:18.292 --> 01:28:20.261
BURDEN ON THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE

01:28:20.328 --> 01:28:21.729
HERE ALREADY ADAM.

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:24.699
BUT THE LOWER INCOME PEOPLE AND

01:28:24.766 --> 01:28:27.101
I KNOW IN YOUR DISTRICT THEY DO --

01:28:27.168 --> 01:28:28.670
NEED TO USE MORE ELECTRICITY FOR

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:30.605
AIR CONDITIONING BECAUSE OF THE

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:32.674
HOTTER SUMMERS AND THAT'S JUST

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.776
CONTINUING TO GET WORSE --

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:36.110
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND WAYS

01:28:36.177 --> 01:28:37.378
TO MAKE THE HOUSES MORE

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:38.746
EFFICIENT TO MAKE THE AIR

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:39.981
CONDITIONING ITSELF MORE

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:41.382
EFFICIENT.

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:45.386
AND YOU KNOW ALLOW FOR WAYS --

01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:47.388
TO TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY THAT

01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:49.657
ARE DON'T USE AS MUCH RESOURCES

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:51.759
AS WERE USING TODAY IF WE CAN DO

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:53.928
ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH I THINK

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:55.863
ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE AND

01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:57.331
WHICH WE COULDN'T GET THE

01:28:57.398 --> 01:28:58.399
INVESTMENT NOT JUST FROM

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:00.001
GOVERNMENT BUT FROM.

01:29:00.068 --> 01:29:02.370
THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO DO THEN I

01:29:02.437 --> 01:29:03.371
THINK WE HAVE.

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:05.440
FOUND A WAY WE CAN FIND A WAY TO

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:08.409
MAKE THIS ACTUALLY A A NET WIN

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:10.411
FOR THE ECONOMY.

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:11.312
THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND I

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:16.818
I I COME FROM A A VERY --

01:29:16.884 --> 01:29:18.419
GREEN COUNTY --

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:20.088
WE HAVE GEO THERMAL.

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:22.290
JEFF WE HAVE WIND.

01:29:22.356 --> 01:29:23.391
WE HAVE SOLAR.

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:25.526
I IN FACT --

01:29:25.593 --> 01:29:27.462
OUR COUNTY SPEARHEADED THE

01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:28.963
EXPANSION OF PEACE PROGRAMS

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.464
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:31.265
CALIFORNIA.

01:29:31.332 --> 01:29:33.334
SO THE WE COULD BE GREEN SO THAT

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:34.435
WE COULD LOWER ELECTRICITY RATES

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:36.337
ESPECIALLY IN.

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:37.905
THE PALM SPRINGS AREA WERE

01:29:37.972 --> 01:29:40.041
GUESTS TO BE A HUNDRED TWENTY TO

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:40.675
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR DEGREES

01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:42.243
IN THE PEAK OF SUMMER.

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:43.945
SO OUR EDITOR CITIZENS OF REALLY --

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:47.148
STEP UP TO THE PLATE --

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.283
THE SCOPING PLAN AND OTHER STATE

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:50.151
POLICIES CALL FOR GREATER

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:51.686
ELECTRIFICATION NEWS YOU

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:52.920
MENTIONED BY EXAMPLE THAT YOU

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:54.756
DRIVE AN ELECTRIC CAR NOW I'M.

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:55.990
VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT I'M I'M

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:57.425
I'M SORT OF A SOMEWHAT OF A

01:29:57.492 --> 01:29:59.460
GREEN REPUBLICAN I ACTUALLY OWN

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:01.062
THREE ELECTRIC CARS.

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:03.831
AND VERY PLEASE WITH --

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:04.432
THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE

01:30:04.499 --> 01:30:06.467
ESPECIALLY WITH.

01:30:06.534 --> 01:30:07.668
RANGING RANGE RANGE ANXIETY AND

01:30:07.735 --> 01:30:09.337
OTHER MANUFACTURERS NOW THAT ARE

01:30:09.403 --> 01:30:11.372
STEPPING UP AND CERTAINLY WE

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:13.141
WE'VE SEEN A BIG --

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:14.942
SOLOMON FROM VOLKSWAGEN THIS

01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:15.877
GOING TO PROVIDE FOR MORE

01:30:15.943 --> 01:30:17.411
ELECTRICAL CHARGING STATIONS

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:18.179
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:19.347
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS TO BE THERE

01:30:19.413 --> 01:30:19.847
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A

01:30:19.914 --> 01:30:20.915
SUCCESSFUL.

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:22.884
MARKETING OF THESE CARS SO THE

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:24.385
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE RANGE

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:25.419
ANXIETY THAT --

01:30:25.486 --> 01:30:27.188
CONCERT MAYES SYSTEM AND I'VE

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:28.289
ALREADY TALKED TO SOME MAJOR

01:30:28.356 --> 01:30:29.557
COMPANIES ABOUT THE TEST LET

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:31.325
TRUCKS --

01:30:31.392 --> 01:30:33.127
END OF THE RANGE THAT THEY GET

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:33.828
AND THE ONLY CHALLENGE THEY HAVE

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:35.229
NOW AS YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE

01:30:35.296 --> 01:30:38.366
PACE AT WHICH THEY CAN BE --

01:30:38.432 --> 01:30:40.001
RECHARGE --

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:40.902
BUT WE KNOW THAT WITH THESE WITH

01:30:40.968 --> 01:30:42.570
THE BATTERIES --

01:30:42.637 --> 01:30:45.640
THAT CALLS FOR CERTAIN MINERALS

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:47.608
THAT ARE READY MIND AND OTHER

01:30:47.675 --> 01:30:49.043
PARTS OF THE OF THE WORLD EVEN

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:51.646
THOUGH WE HAVE A DRAMATIC --

01:30:51.712 --> 01:30:53.981
AMOUNTS OF LITHIA AT THE SALTON

01:30:54.048 --> 01:30:57.018
SEA AREA THAT WE TRY TO MARKET --

01:30:57.084 --> 01:31:00.154
TO TEST Là AND OTHERS BUT WE'RE

01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:03.024
BUT THESE --

01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:06.861
LITHIUM ION BATTERIES --

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:08.496
IN GETTING THAT LET THEM IS BEEN

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:09.764
LINKED TO SIGNIFICANT

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:11.566
ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION.

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.434
CHILDHOOD SLAVERY ESPECIALLY IN

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:15.937
THE CONGO AREA --

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:17.572
AND HAS A A. R. BE CONSIDERED

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:19.006
ITS POTENTIAL ROLAND

01:31:19.073 --> 01:31:20.541
EXACERBATIONS OF THIS.

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:22.376
MORAL CRISIS --

01:31:22.443 --> 01:31:24.245
IN ENSURING THAT WE'RE GETTING --

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:27.081
LITHIUM FROM --

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:29.350
ETHICAL SOURCES IF YOU WILL

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:30.551
NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO AND I

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:31.152
DON'T KNOW IF THIS QUESTION'S

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:33.588
BEEN ASKED BUT WE WE'RE SAYING --

01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:36.023
A LARGER SALE OF ELECTRIC CARS

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:38.793
AND HYBRIDS --

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:41.362
THAT HAVE A CERTAIN LIFE.

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:43.331
WHAT HAS BEEN FOUGHT IN A?

01:31:43.397 --> 01:31:44.732
FIVE IF IT'S ALREADY BEEN

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.801
DISCUSSED I APOLOGIZE BUT WHAT

01:31:46.868 --> 01:31:47.735
WE'RE GONNA DO WITH ALL THESE

01:31:47.802 --> 01:31:49.403
OLD BATTERIES --

01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:50.605
IS THIS GOING TO CREATE ANOTHER

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:52.773
ENVIRONMENTAL --

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:55.142
DEBACLE FOR US IN HERE WE'RE

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.143
TRYING.

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:57.411
TO HAVE A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT BY

01:31:57.478 --> 01:31:58.613
EMBRACING THIS TECHNOLOGY BUT

01:31:58.679 --> 01:32:00.915
ARE WE CREATING A HAZARD.

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:01.482
AT THE END OF LIFE OF THESE

01:32:01.549 --> 01:32:03.584
PRODUCTS.

01:32:03.651 --> 01:32:05.553
A SO I I THINK I HEARD TWO

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.288
DIFFERENT QUESTIONS ALL START

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.390
WITH THE BATTERY ONE WHICH IS --

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:10.825
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK DONE

01:32:10.892 --> 01:32:13.427
ON BATTERY RECYCLING AND HOW TO

01:32:13.494 --> 01:32:16.464
EXTRACT THE MINERALS SUCH AS

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:18.432
LITHIUM FROM --

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:20.201
USED BATTERIES THEIR VARIETY OF

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:21.702
DIFFERENT --

01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:25.840
IDEAS FOR THE BEST RIGHT NOW

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:27.074
THERE ARE.

01:32:27.141 --> 01:32:28.776
YOU PEOPLE UTILIZING SOME OLD

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:31.979
BATTERIES AS A STORAGE --

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:34.382
FOR ACCESS ELECTRICITY AND TIMES

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:36.617
OF WHEN THERE'S MORE ELECTRICITY

01:32:36.684 --> 01:32:38.252
BEING GENERATED AND THEN

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:39.387
ALLOWING IT TO BE RELEASED WHEN

01:32:39.453 --> 01:32:40.554
THERE'S A NEED FOR THE

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:42.924
ELECTRICITY SO THEY CAN YOU CAN

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:45.493
TAKE A BASICALLY A WHOLE ARRAY

01:32:45.559 --> 01:32:47.328
OF THESE AUTOMOTIVE BATTERIES

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:48.663
AND GROUP THEM TOGETHER AND USE

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:49.263
THEM.

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:50.631
AS A STATIONARY SOURCE FOR

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:52.900
STORAGE AND AND GIVING BACK OF

01:32:52.967 --> 01:32:54.602
ELECTRICITY BUT THERE'S ALSO

01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:56.237
WORK BEING DONE ON EXTRACTION OF

01:32:56.304 --> 01:32:58.406
THE MINERALS AND REUSING THEM IN

01:32:58.472 --> 01:32:59.273
BATTERIES.

01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:01.609
AND AS ELECTRIC VEHICLES BEGIN

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:03.878
TO BE MORE THAN THE RELATIVELY

01:33:03.945 --> 01:33:05.212
SMALL SHARE OF THE MARKET THAT

01:33:05.279 --> 01:33:07.048
THEY ARE NATIONALLY YOU'RE GONNA

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:09.183
SEE MORE PLANTS THAT ARE.

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:12.253
BEING CREATED TO DO THAT --

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:14.188
ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION --

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:16.157
WE HAVE NOT --

THAT WE HAVE HERE DOMESTICALLY

UNDERSTANDS OUR KNOWS ABOUT THE

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:44.205
SPACE IN WHICH YOU OCCUPY WHAT

01:35:44.271 --> 01:35:45.306
DO YOU THINK THE BIGGEST

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:46.774
MISUNDERSTANDING THAT THEY HAVE --

01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:49.443
IN THEIR LIFE --

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:51.145
THAT THAT YOU COULD CLEAR UP

01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:51.779
RIGHT HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK IT

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:53.314
IS THAT --

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:54.648
HERE THEY THEY HEAR ALL THE ALL

01:35:54.715 --> 01:35:56.317
THE NATIONAL IT.

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:58.319
EXCHANGE ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND

01:35:58.385 --> 01:36:00.054
INTERNATIONAL.

01:36:00.121 --> 01:36:02.022
I ISSUES IN COUNTRIES MET IN THE

01:36:02.089 --> 01:36:03.257
AND THEN THEIR OWN LIFE THAT

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:04.825
THEY ARE EXPERIENCING.

01:36:04.892 --> 01:36:06.594
WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THEIR

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.528
BIGGEST MISUNDERSTANDING OF YOUR

01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:09.463
WORK [inaudible]

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:13.400
A OF THIS PROBABLY.

01:36:13.467 --> 01:36:14.735
IS NOT THE ANSWER THAT I WOULD

01:36:14.802 --> 01:36:16.437
GIVE IF I'D HAD A LOT MORE TIME

01:36:16.504 --> 01:36:18.305
TO THINK ABOUT IT BUT BUT I WHAT

01:36:18.372 --> 01:36:19.573
I ACTUALLY THINK IS THE BIGGEST

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:20.541
MISUNDERSTANDING.

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.309
WITH THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE THAT

01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:23.777
WE HAVE IS THE FEAR THAT THERE'S

01:36:23.844 --> 01:36:25.479
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THE

01:36:25.546 --> 01:36:26.147
PROBLEM.

01:36:26.213 --> 01:36:30.117
THE MORE I SEE OF THE NEWS CYCLE

01:36:30.184 --> 01:36:31.552
OF THE REPORTING WHICH NOW

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:35.456
ALWAYS IDENTIFIES THE TIE

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:37.057
BETWEEN GLOBAL WARMING AND

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:38.826
THINGS LIKE SPECIES EXTINCTION

01:36:38.893 --> 01:36:41.462
AND FIRES AND FLOODING AND SO

01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:41.695
FORTH.

01:36:41.762 --> 01:36:44.331
THE MORE I FEEL THAT --

01:36:44.398 --> 01:36:45.933
PEOPLE ARE FEELING.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.436
IT WE'VE GONE FROM DENIAL TO

01:36:49.503 --> 01:36:52.273
OVERWHELMED BY THE SIZE OF THE

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:54.441
PROBLEM AND HOW HARD IT IS TO

01:36:54.508 --> 01:36:55.142
ADDRESS.

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:57.311
AND SO IF THERE WAS ONE THING

01:36:57.378 --> 01:36:59.747
THAT I WOULD WANT TO DO IT WOULD

01:36:59.813 --> 01:37:01.282
BE TO TRY.

01:37:01.348 --> 01:37:03.784
TO FIND A WAY TO COMMUNICATE

01:37:03.851 --> 01:37:05.920
THAT ALTHOUGH.

01:37:05.986 --> 01:37:08.155
ADDRESSING IT IS A CHALLENGE AND

01:37:08.222 --> 01:37:09.023
WE WON'T.

01:37:09.089 --> 01:37:11.392
TOTALLY SUCCEED IN MAKING OUR

01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:13.827
CLIMATE BUT IT WAS FIFTY YEARS

01:37:13.894 --> 01:37:15.062
AGO BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY MORE

01:37:15.129 --> 01:37:17.164
CARBON OUT THERE THAN WE COULD

01:37:17.231 --> 01:37:18.899
GET RID OF THROUGH --

01:37:18.966 --> 01:37:20.601
EVEN THROUGH A VERY AGGRESSIVE

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:24.405
PROGRAM OF OF OF CARBON CAPTURE

01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:25.739
NEVER THE LESS THAT THERE ARE

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:27.241
SOLUTIONS.

01:37:27.308 --> 01:37:29.376
THAT WE KNOW ABOUT INCLUDING

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:31.145
JUST SIMPLE THINGS LIKE PLANTING

01:37:31.212 --> 01:37:32.713
TREES --

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:34.782
THAT CAN IF DONE CORRECTLY IN

01:37:34.848 --> 01:37:36.283
THE RIGHT WAY IN THE RIGHT

01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:38.118
PLACES AND YOU KNOW THE TREES

01:37:38.185 --> 01:37:39.887
ARE ALLOWED TO LIVE AND SO FORTH.

01:37:39.954 --> 01:37:41.789
CAN ACTUALLY --

01:37:41.855 --> 01:37:43.757
MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:46.260
WHAT LIFE WILL BE LIKE --

01:37:46.327 --> 01:37:48.429
FOR OUR KIDS AND OUR GRANDKIDS

01:37:48.495 --> 01:37:49.763
SO -- I IT'S

01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:51.799
HARD TO BE BOTH A PESSIMIST

01:37:51.865 --> 01:37:53.300
TALKING ABOUT THE GLOOM AND DOOM

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:55.369
THAT WE'RE FACING FROM SEA LEVEL

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:56.403
RISE AND ALL THESE OTHER

01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:57.304
TERRIBLE THINGS.

01:37:57.371 --> 01:37:58.739
AND TO BE AN OPTIMIST AT THE

01:37:58.806 --> 01:38:01.942
SAME TIME THINK THAT'S WHAT WE

01:38:02.009 --> 01:38:04.345
HAVE TO DO AND IF I COULD.

01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:06.680
YOU KNOW IMPLANT ONE FOUGHT AND

01:38:06.747 --> 01:38:08.048
PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELVES WHO

01:38:08.115 --> 01:38:09.483
REPRESENT --

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:11.151
VOTERS AND WHO TALKED TO PEOPLE

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:12.720
THAT WOULD BE TO HELP US TRY TO

01:38:12.786 --> 01:38:14.622
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO COMMUNICATE

01:38:14.688 --> 01:38:15.055
THAT.

01:38:15.122 --> 01:38:16.957
THANK YOU AND IN ONE ONE OTHER

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:19.460
QUESTION YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:20.027
BEEN WITHIN THE LEGISLATIVE

01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:21.895
COMMUNITY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:24.298
AISLE THERE'S CONSTANT CHATTER

01:38:24.365 --> 01:38:26.634
ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CHOICES

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.235
THAT ARE MADE IN THE SPACE AND

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:29.503
WE OWNING UP TO THE COSTS AND

01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:30.738
BENEFITS AND RISKS AND ALL THE

01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:31.372
REST.

01:38:31.438 --> 01:38:34.341
AND HAVE WEEK AT GIVEN AUTHORITY

01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:36.810
AWAY TO AND NINE ACCOUNTABLE --

01:38:36.877 --> 01:38:39.179
BODY -- THE

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:40.381
AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND THE LIKE

01:38:40.447 --> 01:38:42.049
BUT IF THERE WAS WHILE ONE

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:43.317
MISUNDERSTANDING YOU THINK THAT

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:45.552
WE HAVE AS LEGISLATORS --

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:46.820
THAT YOU COULD CLEAR UP FOR A

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:49.390
ONE AND SPEAK TO TODAY WHAT WHAT

01:38:49.456 --> 01:38:53.227
WOULD THAT MISUNDERSTANDING BE --

01:38:53.294 --> 01:38:54.862
I HAVE.

01:38:54.928 --> 01:38:56.330
I HAVE HEARD THROUGH THE

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:58.332
GRAPEVINE ALTHOUGH MAYBE NOT

01:38:58.399 --> 01:39:00.167
DIRECTLY THAT --

01:39:00.234 --> 01:39:02.069
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINKS THAT

01:39:02.136 --> 01:39:04.471
THERE RESOURCES BOARD IS --

01:39:04.538 --> 01:39:06.707
NOT INTERESTED IN OR NOT

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:08.942
RESPONSIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:39:09.009 --> 01:39:10.210
AND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:15.516
INTERESTED IN AND I SAY THAT YOU

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:16.250
KNOW.

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:18.852
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN EVERYWHERE

01:39:18.919 --> 01:39:20.421
ANTICIPATING EVERYBODY'S

01:39:20.487 --> 01:39:22.356
QUESTIONS OR PROVIDING THEM

01:39:22.423 --> 01:39:23.691
EVERY ANSWER THAT THEY WANTED

01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:26.694
BUT WE SURE TRY --

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.228
TO SEE THIS AS SOMETHING WHERE

01:39:28.295 --> 01:39:31.231
THE LEGISLATURE HAS A ROLE NOT

01:39:31.298 --> 01:39:32.966
JUST AS THE AT NOT JUST IN

01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:34.234
PROVIDING THE MONEY --

01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:35.703
YOU KNOW HAVING US ON THE BACK

01:39:35.769 --> 01:39:37.071
ALTHOUGH THAT'S ALWAYS NICE IF

01:39:37.137 --> 01:39:39.106
THAT HAPPENS BUT MOSTLY IT'S

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:41.442
ABOUT REALLY TRIED TO GET --

01:39:41.508 --> 01:39:43.777
EVERYBODY ON BOARD WITH THE

01:39:43.844 --> 01:39:45.379
OVERALL APPROACH BECAUSE IT IS

01:39:45.446 --> 01:39:47.481
SO BIG AND COMPLICATED SO I

01:39:47.548 --> 01:39:48.649
DON'T EXPECT THERE TO BE

01:39:48.716 --> 01:39:51.218
UNANIMITY ABOUT ANYTHING BUT I

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:53.487
THINK IF WE CAN USE.

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:58.225
HEARING IS LIKE THE TO TO

01:39:58.292 --> 01:40:00.361
PROMOTE A SENSE THAT THIS IS A

01:40:00.427 --> 01:40:02.463
SHARED ACTIVITY.

01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:05.833
THAT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING --

01:40:05.899 --> 01:40:07.601
YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:09.503
THERE WAS CERTAINLY A SENSE THAT --

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:11.772
A ARBY'S PROGRAMS WERE ONLY

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:15.409
FOCUSING ON THE A LEAD IN THAT

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:16.143
WE WEREN'T --

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:18.278
THINKING ENOUGH ABOUT THE

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:19.847
PROBLEMS OF PEOPLE IN THE

01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:22.783
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SO

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:24.084
THAT WAS A SPATE OF LEGISLATION

01:40:24.151 --> 01:40:26.453
THAT WAS DESIGNED TO BOTH EXPAND

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.121
THE BOARD.

01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:28.455
ODD TO PUT MEMBERS OF THE

01:40:28.522 --> 01:40:30.524
LEGISLATURE ON THE BOARD AND TO

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:32.359
MAKE SURE THAT A PERCENTAGE OF

01:40:32.426 --> 01:40:35.929
ALL THE FUNDS OF THAT ARE

01:40:35.996 --> 01:40:37.364
ACCUMULATED FROM THE CAP AND

01:40:37.431 --> 01:40:38.832
TRADE PROGRAM WERE SPENT IN

01:40:38.899 --> 01:40:40.501
THOSE COMMUNITIES.

01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:43.137
AND IT SEEMED AT FIRST LIKE THIS

01:40:43.203 --> 01:40:47.274
WAS A INTENDED TO BE A LOT OF IT

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:49.443
OUT THAT IT WAS A SIGN THAT.

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:50.277
THINGS HADN'T BEEN DONE WELL IN

01:40:50.344 --> 01:40:53.280
THE PAST LET'S.

01:40:53.347 --> 01:40:55.349
JUST LIKE WHEN TERM LIMITS WERE

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:57.050
PASS THERE IS A SENSE OF

01:40:57.117 --> 01:41:00.320
NEGATIVITY ABOUT AT ALL --

01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:01.789
AND MAYBE IN SOME RESPECTS

01:41:01.855 --> 01:41:03.757
THINGS GO TOO FAR --

01:41:03.824 --> 01:41:07.060
BUT I FIND THAT THE INCREASED

01:41:07.127 --> 01:41:11.398
ATTENTION AND ABILITY TO GO INTO --

01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:13.934
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND TO

01:41:14.001 --> 01:41:17.438
SHOW THAT THE PROGRAM IS HAVING

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:19.273
AN IMPACT THAT MONIES HAVE BEEN

01:41:19.339 --> 01:41:21.542
ACTUALLY SPENT IN COMMUNITIES ON

01:41:21.608 --> 01:41:24.077
PROJECTS THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT.

01:41:24.144 --> 01:41:27.414
IS A TREMENDOUS ASSET HAND WHEN

01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:29.316
PEOPLE -- IT

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:30.317
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IN

01:41:30.384 --> 01:41:32.386
PARTICULAR ARE ASKING ABOUT THE

01:41:32.453 --> 01:41:34.121
PROGRAM I ALWAYS MAKE IT A POINT

01:41:34.188 --> 01:41:36.356
TO TELL THEM ABOUT THIS PIECE OF

01:41:36.423 --> 01:41:38.792
IT BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T

01:41:38.859 --> 01:41:40.494
KNOW THAT IN ADDITION TO DOING A

01:41:40.561 --> 01:41:42.095
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:43.864
AND COLLECTING ALL THIS MONEY

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:45.933
THAT WE ACTUALLY SPENT THE MONEY

01:41:45.999 --> 01:41:47.634
ON THINGS THAT WERE THAT THE

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:50.070
LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED IT FOR

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:53.807
AND THAT WERE BENEFICIAL --

01:41:53.874 --> 01:41:55.342
TO TWO PEOPLE AND THAT PART OF

01:41:55.409 --> 01:41:57.544
IT SOMETIMES JUST GETS LOST IN

01:41:57.611 --> 01:42:00.280
THE DISCUSSIONS SO I HOPE TO DO

01:42:00.347 --> 01:42:00.981
MORE OF THAT.

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:03.150

I THINK.

01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:13.861
ONE OF PEOPLE ARE GRAND KIDS

01:42:13.927 --> 01:42:15.429
LOOK BACK AT WHAT WE ARE DOING

01:42:15.496 --> 01:42:16.196

THOSE THOUGHTS.

01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:29.109
I HAVE A NUMBER  THINK SOMEONE

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:30.377
ASKED ABOUT BUT I REALIZE WE

01:42:30.444 --> 01:42:32.312
ONLY HAVE BEEN LESSEN OUR NOW

01:42:32.379 --> 01:42:33.847
I'M LEFT TO GO AND TO UP TO

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:35.516

THERE'S ONLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:41.288
YOU WANT TO STATE PUBLICLY GIVEN --

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:42.456
THE IMPACT THAT YOUR REMARKS

01:42:42.523 --> 01:42:44.491
SOMETIMES HAVE ON THE MARKET THE

01:42:44.558 --> 01:42:46.026
AUCTIONS --

01:42:46.093 --> 01:42:47.227
SO I'M GOING.

01:42:47.294 --> 01:42:49.363

01:42:49.429 --> 01:42:50.631

THE YOUR JUSTIFICATION BY THE

01:43:08.582 --> 01:43:09.082
38%.

01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:10.551
IN THE SCOPING PLANNED THOUGH --

01:43:10.617 --> 01:43:14.555
I I CAN I CAN SURMISE WHAT SOME

01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:16.690
OF THAT IS GOING TO IN IN --

01:43:16.757 --> 01:43:18.392
I IMPLICATE TERMS A DECISIONS AT

01:43:18.458 --> 01:43:19.826
THE RP.

01:43:19.893 --> 01:43:21.828
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE.

01:43:21.895 --> 01:43:24.464
TO GET A SPELL THAT OUT TOO MUCH --

01:43:24.531 --> 01:43:25.566
BUT BUT I KNOW THAT TECH THAT

01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:26.667
CONTINUES TO BE AN AREA OF

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:28.435
CONCERN OUT THERE AND THEY'RE I

01:43:28.502 --> 01:43:30.504

01:43:30.571 --> 01:43:31.572
CLAIM THAT THE IMPACT IS BEEN

01:43:31.638 --> 01:43:36.009
EVEN LESS THAN 5% ADD.

01:43:36.076 --> 01:43:37.377
SO HOW WE GO FROM THERE ABOUT

01:43:37.444 --> 01:43:38.478
THE OTHERS DEBATES ABOUT THAT

01:43:38.545 --> 01:43:39.613
BUT HOW WE GO FROM THERE ARE TO

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:40.013
THIRTY EIGHT IS --

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.015
SO TOUGH.

01:43:42.082 --> 01:43:44.017

ASSUMPTIONS AND THE THE REASONS

01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:58.699
WHY LEAVE --

01:43:58.765 --> 01:44:01.401
ALLOCATED THE PERCENTAGES OF

01:44:01.468 --> 01:44:02.669
REDUCTIONS IN THE WAY THAT WE

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:05.939

FOLLOW UP THAT WAY WE CERTAINLY

01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:09.242
WOULD BE.

01:44:22.689 --> 01:44:24.625
I SHARE A LAST QUESTION I'M NOT

01:44:24.691 --> 01:44:25.325
A QUICK QUESTION I JUST WANT TO

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:26.426
THANK YOU ON THIS NICHOLS I

01:44:26.493 --> 01:44:27.995
THINK YOU STARTED WHEN I DID

01:44:28.061 --> 01:44:29.529
BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE IT

01:44:29.596 --> 01:44:30.797
WAS ON ONE OF THE COMMITTEES ON

01:44:30.864 --> 01:44:31.064
I THINK.

01:44:31.131 --> 01:44:31.965
YOU CAME.

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:33.200
I INTO THE LEGISLATURE AT THAT

01:44:33.266 --> 01:44:34.334
TIME SO --

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:36.269
GOOD JOB MANY MANY YEARS ARE I

01:44:36.336 --> 01:44:38.338
JUST LIKE TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS MY

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:40.240
COMMENT TO OUR CHAIR I THINK IT

01:44:40.307 --> 01:44:41.775
WOULD BE SO VERY IMPORTANT. TO

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:43.243
HAVE THIS NICHOLS BACK FOR A

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:44.645
MORE EXTENDED CONVERSATION

01:44:44.711 --> 01:44:47.414
REGARDING OUR THEIR APPROACH ON

01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:49.449
A ARE BE BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED

01:44:49.516 --> 01:44:51.551
SPECIFICALLY WITH THE TIMING OF

01:44:51.618 --> 01:44:52.819
ALL OF THIS FAITHFULLY ELEVEN

01:44:52.886 --> 01:44:53.954
YEARS AND WHICH WERE SUPPOSED TO

01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:55.455
MEET A NEW TARGET.

01:44:55.522 --> 01:44:56.857
AND THAT IS I THINK WHAT CREATES

01:44:56.923 --> 01:44:59.226
THE EXTREME ANXIETY IN OUR

01:44:59.292 --> 01:45:00.560
COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:02.029
MORE OF THE SAME ISSUE SAID IT

01:45:02.095 --> 01:45:03.430
HAS TO BE MORE OF THE SAME AND

01:45:03.497 --> 01:45:05.065
ASK ME FASTER.

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:06.800
AND THERE ARE CERTAIN MAJOR

01:45:06.867 --> 01:45:08.735
IMPACTS TO OUR LOW INCOME

01:45:08.802 --> 01:45:10.337
COMMUNITIES AND WE CANNOT DENY

01:45:10.404 --> 01:45:11.705
THAT ANY LONGER.

01:45:11.772 --> 01:45:14.207
THE REGRESSIVE PRICING --

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:16.243
THE THE PRICING POLICIES ARE SO

01:45:16.309 --> 01:45:17.444
REGRESSIVE THEY'RE REALLY

01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:18.111
HURTING AND LET ME GIVE YOU ONE

01:45:18.178 --> 01:45:19.446
EXAMPLE.

01:45:19.513 --> 01:45:21.448
MY BROTHER IS LOW INCOME HIS

01:45:21.515 --> 01:45:29.456
ENERGY BILL WAS ALMOST OUR 35%

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:31.958
OF HIS TOTAL INCOME THIS MONTH.

01:45:32.025 --> 01:45:32.826
BECAUSE HE NEEDED SUMMIT HEAT.

01:45:32.893 --> 01:45:33.860
SO THESE ARE REAL

01:45:33.927 --> 01:45:35.128
STORIES OF OF CALIFORNIANS WE

01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:36.430
NEED TO DO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:45:36.496 --> 01:45:36.963
DO HERE IN TERMS OF OUR

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:38.298
ENVIRONMENT SAVING THE PLANET

01:45:38.365 --> 01:45:39.266
ALL OF THAT.

01:45:39.332 --> 01:45:40.333
THAT I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE --

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.537
A DEEPER DIVE THESE ARE

01:45:43.603 --> 01:45:44.705
DEVELOPED AND THE SPEED AT WHICH

01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:45.939
EACH AND EVERYONE OF ON THIS

01:45:46.006 --> 01:45:47.340
IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE THEY THINK

01:45:47.407 --> 01:45:49.443
WE HEARD IN THE EARLY COMMENTS.

01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:50.544
THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER COST

01:45:50.610 --> 01:45:53.180
EFFECTIVE MODEL WE NEED TO DO A

01:45:53.246 --> 01:45:55.148
A DEEPER DIVE ON WHAT IS WORKING

01:45:55.215 --> 01:45:56.717
AND AND WHICH IS FASTEST.

01:45:56.783 --> 01:45:58.685
IN GETTING A FIRMWARE CLOSER SO

01:45:58.752 --> 01:46:00.387
I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO THAT

01:46:00.454 --> 01:46:00.620
TODAY.

01:46:00.687 --> 01:46:01.388
THAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE THIS

01:46:01.455 --> 01:46:03.423
NICHOLS COME BACK SO WE CAN HAVE

01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:04.357
pMORE OF THAT KIND OF

01:46:04.424 --> 01:46:04.991
CONVERSATION.

01:46:05.058 --> 01:46:07.360
I DO BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE

01:46:07.427 --> 01:46:09.162
NEEDS TO HAVE MORE ENGAGEMENT IF.

01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:11.898
OVERSIGHT ALSO ON THE POLICIES

01:46:11.965 --> 01:46:14.501
THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH A

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:16.336
RB THEN THAT EXPAND --

01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:17.671
MAJOR OF THE DISCUSSION HERE

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:19.272

THAT FINAL COMMENT GAS IN MY

01:46:31.818 --> 01:46:34.488

01:46:34.554 --> 01:46:35.388

01:46:54.608 --> 01:46:55.041
HAVE BEEN RAISED BY OUR

01:46:55.108 --> 01:46:56.309
COLLEAGUES ABOUT --

01:46:56.376 --> 01:46:57.577

FOR YOU ALL THINK THE THE MOST

01:48:31.571 --> 01:48:32.939
IMPORTANT THING TO SAY.

01:48:33.006 --> 01:48:36.009
ABOUT THE SITUATION RIGHT NOW IS --

01:48:36.076 --> 01:48:36.910
THE DEBATES AND DISCUSSIONS ALL

01:48:36.977 --> 01:48:38.411
HAD I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:48:38.478 --> 01:48:40.213
DISCUSSIONS OF MY ROLE AS A

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.014
MEMBER OF THE INDEPENDENT

01:48:41.081 --> 01:48:42.549
EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY

01:48:42.616 --> 01:48:44.050
COMMITTEE OR THE I MAC.

01:48:44.117 --> 01:48:44.985
IS TO REVIEW THE DECISIONS AND

01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:46.186
DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:47.487
AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ADVICE

01:48:47.554 --> 01:48:48.555
ABOUT THOSE --

01:48:48.622 --> 01:48:49.890
DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS I

01:48:49.956 --> 01:48:51.291
THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I

01:48:51.358 --> 01:48:52.492
CAN SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT THE

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:54.361
THE SCOPING PLAN THAT WAS

01:48:54.427 --> 01:48:56.396
DEVELOPED AND FINALIZED.

01:48:56.463 --> 01:48:57.430
IN LATE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AFTER

01:48:57.497 --> 01:49:01.234
THE A MUCH INCREASED ROLE FOR

01:49:01.301 --> 01:49:02.002
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS YOU

01:49:02.068 --> 01:49:03.336
DISCUSS NATIONAL THROATED

01:49:03.403 --> 01:49:04.704
DIFFERENT NUMBER YOU ALL BEEN

01:49:04.771 --> 01:49:05.805
CITING THE NUMBER FOR CUMULATIVE

01:49:05.872 --> 01:49:07.240
EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND IT'S

01:49:07.307 --> 01:49:08.375
TRUE THAT.

01:49:08.441 --> 01:49:10.577
THE PLAN FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS

01:49:10.644 --> 01:49:12.512
RELIES ON THIS PROGRAM 438% OF

01:49:12.579 --> 01:49:14.080
THE MISSION REDUCTIONS IF YOU

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:15.515
LOOK AT THE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:16.950
REQUIRED IN THE YEAR TWENTY

01:49:17.017 --> 01:49:18.351
THIRTY A NUMBERS ACTUALLY BUT

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:19.052
47%.

01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:21.187
SO THAT HALF OF THE WORK THAT

01:49:21.254 --> 01:49:22.555
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO ACCORDING

01:49:22.622 --> 01:49:23.490
TO THE SCOPE AND PLAN IS

01:49:23.556 --> 01:49:24.791
EXPECTED TO COME FROM THE CAPITA

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:25.859
RATE PROGRAM.

01:49:25.926 --> 01:49:27.594
THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS

01:49:27.661 --> 01:49:28.929
ITERATIONS OF THE SCOPE IN PLAN

01:49:28.995 --> 01:49:29.930
WE'RE CAP AND TRADE IS PLAYED A

01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:31.298
MUCH SMALLER --

01:49:31.364 --> 01:49:33.967
AND AN ARGUABLY LESS SIGNIFICANT

01:49:34.034 --> 01:49:34.701
ROLE.

01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:35.702
AND I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:49:35.769 --> 01:49:36.670
THING I CAN SHARE WITH YOU THE

01:49:36.736 --> 01:49:37.370
RESPECT OF THIS PLAN IS THAT THE

01:49:37.437 --> 01:49:39.039
CAPITA RATE REGULATIONS ADOPTED

01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:40.607
IN DECEMBER.

01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:41.207
ALMOST NO RELATIONSHIP TO THAT

01:49:41.274 --> 01:49:43.410
PLAN.

01:49:43.476 --> 01:49:46.379
JUST ALMOST NO RELATIONSHIP --

01:49:46.446 --> 01:49:47.681
UP THE TESTIMONY I HAVE IN

01:49:47.747 --> 01:49:48.782
WRITING WILL WALK THROUGH SOME

01:49:48.848 --> 01:49:50.350
OF THE DETAILS ABOUT THIS THE

01:49:50.417 --> 01:49:52.352
ASSUMPTIONS IN THE SCOPING PLAN

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:54.254
ARE RADICALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE

01:49:54.321 --> 01:49:55.221
STATEMENTS MADE BY THE BOARD

01:49:55.288 --> 01:49:56.356
WITH RESPECT TO THEIR

01:49:56.423 --> 01:49:58.358
EXPECTATIONS FOR THE PROGRAM --

01:49:58.425 --> 01:50:00.460
THE REGULATORY ANALYSIS DONE

01:50:00.527 --> 01:50:02.028
DOESN'T CONFRONT THE PLANE

01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:04.397
STATUTORY DIRECTION. TO ADDRESS

01:50:04.464 --> 01:50:05.231
THE ISSUE OF THERE BEING TOO

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:06.132
MANY ALLOWANCES IN THE PROGRAM

01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:08.001
WHICH A DOCTOR BROWN TALKED

01:50:08.068 --> 01:50:09.569
ABOUT -- AND

01:50:09.636 --> 01:50:11.571
I WON'T EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL.

01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:13.073
FROM THE ANNOUNCES THAT SON ALSO

01:50:13.139 --> 01:50:14.107
MY OPINION RESTS ON A BASIC

01:50:14.174 --> 01:50:16.309
MATTER THAT OTHER LEGISLATIVE

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:17.844
COMMITTEES HAVE IDENTIFIED --

01:50:17.911 --> 01:50:19.612
AND WHICH FRANKLY I THINK IS

01:50:19.679 --> 01:50:21.114
WELL BELOW THE STANDARDS WE NEED

01:50:21.181 --> 01:50:21.982
TO SET FOR OURSELVES IN TERMS OF

01:50:22.048 --> 01:50:23.383
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AGAIN

01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:24.851
WHEREVER PEOPLE WANT TO COME OUT

01:50:24.918 --> 01:50:27.020
ON THE QUESTION OF WHAT ROLE.

01:50:27.087 --> 01:50:27.554
OF CAP AND TRADE AND OTHER

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.155
REGULATORY INSTRUMENTS BASIC

01:50:29.222 --> 01:50:30.223
FACTS NEED TO BE CLEAR --

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:32.759
AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE NOT

01:50:32.826 --> 01:50:34.894
BEEN SO FAR IN THIS PROCESS --

01:50:34.961 --> 01:50:37.330
I WILL REFER YOU TO A COUPLE OF

01:50:37.397 --> 01:50:40.233
RECOMMENDATIONS THE I A MAC PUT%

01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:41.401
OUT ITS FIRST ANNUAL REPORT IN

01:50:41.468 --> 01:50:42.235
OCTOBER.

01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:43.470
AND TO ADDRESS THIS DEBATE OVER

01:50:43.536 --> 01:50:44.571
WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRAM'S

01:50:44.637 --> 01:50:46.172
PERFORMING WELL RECOMMENDED

01:50:46.239 --> 01:50:48.041
METRICS TO TRACK THIS QUESTION

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:49.809
OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE ACCESS

01:50:49.876 --> 01:50:50.410
COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS IN THE

01:50:50.477 --> 01:50:51.845
PROGRAM --

01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:53.747
SO FA A. R. B. HAS NOT ENGAGED

01:50:53.813 --> 01:50:55.782
OR ADOPTED ANY SUCH METRICS BUT

01:50:55.849 --> 01:50:56.816
THERE ARE METRICS THAT ARE OUT

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:58.284
THERE IN FACT EVERY OTHER CAP

01:50:58.351 --> 01:50:59.452
AND TRADE PROGRAM IN THE WORLD

01:50:59.519 --> 01:51:01.187
HAS THESE KINDS OF METRICS SO IN

01:51:01.254 --> 01:51:02.856
SOME RESPECTS FOR LACKING THE

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:04.958
OTHER LEADERS IN THE SPACE --

01:51:05.025 --> 01:51:06.926
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE

01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:08.495
KINDS OF METRICS AND MY TEAM AND

01:51:08.561 --> 01:51:09.362
THERE'S HEROES PRODUCED.

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:10.530
ONE I'D REFER YOU TO PAGE FIVE

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:13.299
OF MY HAND OUT THE MOST

01:51:13.366 --> 01:51:15.402
COMPLICATED LOOKING CHART.

01:51:15.468 --> 01:51:16.503
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY VERY SIMPLE

01:51:16.569 --> 01:51:17.003
STATEMENT.

01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:18.438
IF YOU TRACK THE NUMBER OF

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:20.507
ALLOWANCES AND CARBON OFFSETS

01:51:20.573 --> 01:51:22.008
THE INSTRUMENTS THAT CAN BE USED

01:51:22.075 --> 01:51:22.976
FOR COMPLIANCE IN THE CAPITA

01:51:23.043 --> 01:51:24.144
RATE PROGRAM TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:51:24.210 --> 01:51:25.178
WHAT'S IN PRIVATE ACCOUNTS WITH

01:51:25.245 --> 01:51:27.480
PEOPLE ACTUALLY PURCHASED AT

01:51:27.547 --> 01:51:28.048
AUCTION.

01:51:28.114 --> 01:51:29.549
CAN YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE

01:51:29.616 --> 01:51:31.618
COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS THEY FACE

01:51:31.684 --> 01:51:33.553
YOU CAN TRACK THE EXCESS BUILDUP

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.255
OF THESE ALLOWANCES AN OFFSET IN

01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:36.389
PRIVATE ACCOUNTS THIS IS NOT

01:51:36.456 --> 01:51:37.957
SPECULATIVE THIS IS LITERALLY

01:51:38.024 --> 01:51:38.958
WHAT ENTITIES ARE HOLDING

01:51:39.025 --> 01:51:41.261
ACCORDING TO AIR BEES REPORTING.

01:51:41.327 --> 01:51:42.595
AND THERE'S BEEN A DEBATE ABOUT

01:51:42.662 --> 01:51:43.296
THIS ISSUE --

01:51:43.363 --> 01:51:44.464
AS DOCTOR BROWN ALLUDED TO

01:51:44.531 --> 01:51:45.732
EARLIER THIS MORNING I THINK

01:51:45.799 --> 01:51:47.333
IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:48.835
PART OF THE POST TWENTY TWENTY

01:51:48.902 --> 01:51:51.004
MARKET DESIGN PACKAGE --

01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:52.439
IN DISMISSING THIS PROBLEM

01:51:52.505 --> 01:51:54.407
ENTIRELY IN TAKING NO ACTION TO

01:51:54.474 --> 01:51:55.008
CORRECT IT.

01:51:55.075 --> 01:51:56.609
OF THE BOARD PROJECTED THAT AS A

01:51:56.676 --> 01:51:58.812
WORST CASE SCENARIO NO MORE THAN

01:51:58.878 --> 01:51:59.979
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:01.381
ALLOWANCES WILL BE IN PRIVATE

01:52:01.448 --> 01:52:02.449
HANDS IN EXCESS OF THEIR

01:52:02.515 --> 01:52:04.350
COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS AND SAVED

01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:05.351
INTO THE POST TWENTY TWENTY

01:52:05.418 --> 01:52:05.885
PERIOD.

01:52:05.952 --> 01:52:07.854
BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY NO

01:52:07.921 --> 01:52:08.388
MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY

01:52:08.455 --> 01:52:09.689
MILLION --

01:52:09.756 --> 01:52:11.191
THE METRIC MY TEAM HAS DEVELOPED

01:52:11.257 --> 01:52:12.959
A VERY CLEARLY SHOWS THAT WE ARE

01:52:13.026 --> 01:52:14.127
IN EXCESS OF THAT.

01:52:14.194 --> 01:52:16.129
AS OF THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:17.263
AND THE PROJECTIONS FROM

01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:18.698
INDEPENDENT NON PARTISAN

01:52:18.765 --> 01:52:20.834
FINANCIALLY DISINTERESTED GROUPS --

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.202
CLOCKING UP QUITE A BIT HIGHER

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:23.436
THAN THE ARBY'S PROJECTIONS.

01:52:23.503 --> 01:52:24.971
SHOWED.

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:26.172
A AND IT LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST FOR

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:27.507
NOW WE ARE ON TRACK FOR THOSE

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:29.175
PROBLEMS TO MANIFESTED THE SKILL

01:52:29.242 --> 01:52:31.211
THAT CRITICS HAVE IDENTIFIED --

01:52:31.277 --> 01:52:32.345
I WANNA POINT OF THIS PROBLEM IS

01:52:32.412 --> 01:52:33.613
LIKELY TO GET WORSE FOR SOME

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.381
TIME.

01:52:35.448 --> 01:52:37.317
THE PROGRAM CAPS ARE HIGHER THAN

01:52:37.383 --> 01:52:38.485
EMISSIONS COVERED IN THE PROGRAM

01:52:38.551 --> 01:52:40.353
AND SO LONG AS THESE OPTIONS

01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:41.254
CONTINUE TO SELL ALL THE

01:52:41.321 --> 01:52:42.822
ALLOWANCE IS MADE AVAILABLE.

01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:44.457
THE EXCESS SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES

01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:45.458
WILL ACCUMULATE AND PRIVATE

01:52:45.525 --> 01:52:46.559
ACCOUNTS --

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:47.827
THE ONLY WAY THIS PROBLEM

01:52:47.894 --> 01:52:49.162
DOESN'T GET BETTER OR SORRY GETS

01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:50.463
BETTER OF ITS OWN ACCORD IS IF

01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:51.698
PEOPLE STOP BUYING ALLOWANCES AT

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:53.199
AUCTION WHICH MEANS LOWER

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:54.000
REVENUES AND DISRUPTION THE

01:52:54.067 --> 01:52:55.401
PROGRAM.

01:52:55.468 --> 01:52:56.636
I DON'T THINK ANYONE EXPECTS THE

01:52:56.703 --> 01:52:58.438
COLLAPSE LIKE WHAT WE SAW IN

01:52:58.505 --> 01:52:59.639
TWENTY SIXTEEN OR TWENTY

01:52:59.706 --> 01:53:00.507
SEVENTEN BUT QUESTIONS AROUND

01:53:00.573 --> 01:53:03.143
THE OUTLOOK FOR TIGHTLY

01:53:03.209 --> 01:53:04.377
INTERTWINED WITH THIS IF.

01:53:04.444 --> 01:53:05.578
THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES TO

01:53:05.645 --> 01:53:07.780
MANIFEST WE WILL HAVE PROBLEMS

01:53:07.847 --> 01:53:09.816
MEETING OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOAL --

01:53:09.883 --> 01:53:12.218
IF THE OPTIONS STOP SELLING OUT --

01:53:12.285 --> 01:53:13.720
WE MIGHT SORT OF MITIGATE THAT

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:15.455
TO SOME EXTENT BUT YOU HAVE THE

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:16.022
REVENUE IMPLICATIONS I JUST

01:53:16.089 --> 01:53:17.490
DISCUSSED.

01:53:17.557 --> 01:53:19.726
SO I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT

01:53:19.792 --> 01:53:21.961
WHEN YOU HAVE ALMOST HALF OF THE

01:53:22.028 --> 01:53:22.929
PLANNED REDUCTIONS FOR THIS

01:53:22.996 --> 01:53:23.930
AGGRESSIVE TARGET COMING FROM A

01:53:23.997 --> 01:53:25.431
PROGRAM.

01:53:25.498 --> 01:53:26.799
AND NO ANALYTICAL CONSISTENCY

01:53:26.866 --> 01:53:28.501
BETWEEN THE REGULATORY DESIGNED

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:29.802
THAT PROGRAM AND THOSE

01:53:29.869 --> 01:53:31.171
ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE ARE IN QUITE

01:53:31.237 --> 01:53:33.640
A DIFFICULT PERIOD --

01:53:33.706 --> 01:53:35.074
I ALSO WANT TO RESPECT --

01:53:35.141 --> 01:53:36.843
THE COMMENTS MADE BY SENATOR

01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:38.144
BATES AND SENATOR STONE ABOUT

01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:39.212
COST IMPACTS.

01:53:39.279 --> 01:53:40.346
THERE IS THERE'S NO QUESTION

01:53:40.413 --> 01:53:42.015
THERE ARE COST IMPACTS WHEN YOU

01:53:42.081 --> 01:53:43.883
PURSUE CLIMATE POLICIES.

01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:45.151
I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:46.452
A MARKET BASED PROGRAM LIKE A

01:53:46.519 --> 01:53:47.620
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS THAT

01:53:47.687 --> 01:53:48.588
AFFORDS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:50.523
MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS DIRECTLY

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:51.691
AND ONE ISSUE WE CAN DISCUSS IF

01:53:51.758 --> 01:53:52.959
IT'S OF INTEREST.

01:53:53.026 --> 01:53:53.860
IS WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE SHOULD

01:53:53.927 --> 01:53:55.094
BE RECYCLING SOME OF THE REVENUE

01:53:55.161 --> 01:53:56.629
RAISED BY THIS PROGRAM TO

01:53:56.696 --> 01:53:58.431
DIRECTLY MEDICAID THE COST

01:53:58.498 --> 01:53:59.399
IMPACTS TO LOW INCOME AND OTHER

01:53:59.465 --> 01:54:00.700
FAMILIES --

01:54:00.767 --> 01:54:01.601
RIGHT NOW WE ARE BASICALLY A

01:54:01.668 --> 01:54:03.102
SPENDING ORIENTED MODEL WHERE

01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:04.571
ALMOST ALL OF THE REVENUE.

01:54:04.637 --> 01:54:06.039
GETS SPENT ON DISCRETIONARY AND

01:54:06.105 --> 01:54:08.174
PRE APPROPRIATED FORMULAS --

01:54:08.241 --> 01:54:09.842
BY THE LEGISLATURE --

01:54:09.909 --> 01:54:11.744
IT IS TRUE THAT RAISING PRICES

01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:13.680
WILL HAVE COST IMPACTS AND THAT

01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:15.348
IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT

01:54:15.415 --> 01:54:16.583
LEGISLATORS AND THE EXECUTIVE

01:54:16.649 --> 01:54:18.184
BRANCH HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM.

01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:18.818
TO CONSIDER ADDRESSING SOME OF

01:54:18.885 --> 01:54:21.120
THOSE ISSUES IF YOU WANT TO DO

01:54:21.187 --> 01:54:23.056
MORE THAN IT'S DOING TODAY.

01:54:23.122 --> 01:54:24.290
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RELY ON

01:54:24.357 --> 01:54:25.558
THIS PROGRAM TO DO MORE THAN

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:26.192
IT'S DOING TODAY WHICH IS NOT

01:54:26.259 --> 01:54:27.026
MUCH.

01:54:27.093 --> 01:54:28.528
OTHER STRATEGIES NEED TO BE

01:54:28.595 --> 01:54:30.396
ADOPTED TO STAND TRACK FOR THE

01:54:30.463 --> 01:54:31.364
SB THIRTY TO TARGET.

01:54:31.431 --> 01:54:32.498
AND THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS

01:54:32.565 --> 01:54:34.367
TO ECHO DR BROWN'S TESTIMONY I

01:54:34.434 --> 01:54:36.002
THINK A LOT OF THOSE STRATEGIES

01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:37.437
LOOK MUCH LESS COST EFFECTIVE

01:54:37.503 --> 01:54:38.504
THAN A WELL DESIGNED MARKET

01:54:38.571 --> 01:54:40.406
BASED PROGRAM.

01:54:40.473 --> 01:54:42.375
AND SO APPRECIATING THAT HIGHER

01:54:42.442 --> 01:54:43.876
EXPLICIT ENERGY COSTS CARRY

01:54:43.943 --> 01:54:45.378
POLITICAL COSTS THE KERRY

01:54:45.445 --> 01:54:46.179
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR

01:54:46.246 --> 01:54:47.213
CONSTITUENTS.

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:50.416
pSMART DESIGNS THAT THE DIFFERENT

01:54:50.483 --> 01:54:51.351
STRUCTURE THAN WHAT WE'RE

01:54:51.417 --> 01:54:52.352
TALKING ABOUT.

01:54:52.418 --> 01:54:53.987
IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION WE'RE

01:54:54.053 --> 01:54:55.521
OFF TRACK FOR THE TWENTY THIRTY

01:54:55.588 --> 01:54:56.322
TARGET IN MY OPINION.

01:54:56.389 --> 01:54:57.690
I AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE

01:54:57.757 --> 01:54:59.292
DIFFICULTIES IN BALANCING THESE

01:54:59.359 --> 01:55:01.761
ISSUES BOTH AT A OR B. AND IN

01:55:01.828 --> 01:55:02.128
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:06.332
I'LL STOP THERE [inaudible]

01:55:06.399 --> 01:55:13.006
YEAH -- ONCE

01:55:13.072 --> 01:55:15.675
AGAIN I I JUST CAN'T HOW I THIS

01:55:15.742 --> 01:55:18.177
IS ALL COMPLICATED STUFF AND YOU

01:55:18.244 --> 01:55:19.279
KNOW VIEW ALL HAMMY BIG

01:55:19.345 --> 01:55:20.146
DOCUMENTS LITERALLY AT THE

01:55:20.213 --> 01:55:21.247
HEARING.

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:24.884
AND IT'S HARD FOR ME. TO TO SOAK

01:55:24.951 --> 01:55:26.986
IT ALL IN AND SO I JUST I PUT A

01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:28.154
LITTLE MESSAGE OUT TO THE

01:55:28.221 --> 01:55:29.789
UNIVERSE THAT THE THE THE SOONER

01:55:29.856 --> 01:55:31.591
EVERYONE GOT TO SIR MATERIALS --

01:55:31.658 --> 01:55:33.993
THE MORE WE CAN ACTUALLY GRAPPLE

01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:35.428
WITH THEM IN PREPARE FOR THIS

01:55:35.495 --> 01:55:37.630
HEARING BUT DO APPRECIATE YOUR

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:39.832
ALBEIT VERY DARK ASSESSMENT.

01:55:39.899 --> 01:55:43.569
OF THE OF THE FACTORS AT PLAY I

01:55:43.636 --> 01:55:45.071
GUESS THE QUESTION IS --

01:55:45.138 --> 01:55:45.938
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE THE

01:55:46.005 --> 01:55:50.843
LEGISLATURE DO? TO PUSH --

01:55:50.910 --> 01:55:51.978
AN YOU DO I MEAN YOU'RE

01:55:52.045 --> 01:55:55.381
COMMITTEE DOES SERVE AS A AS IN

01:55:55.448 --> 01:55:56.949
AS CAN OFFICIAL ADVISER TO THE

01:55:57.016 --> 01:55:58.918
AIR BE.

01:55:58.985 --> 01:56:00.453
ARE YOU MAKING A SERIES OF

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:03.356
RECOMMENDS THE I MAC MAKING --

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:04.457
LOOK WHAT WHAT I GUESS THE DID

01:56:04.524 --> 01:56:05.258
COME OUT OF THIS REPORT THAT THE

01:56:05.325 --> 01:56:08.127
THE QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD SPEND

01:56:08.194 --> 01:56:08.761
THE INTERPLAY WITH THERE BE ARE

01:56:08.828 --> 01:56:12.865
THEY WHOA WHOA --

01:56:12.932 --> 01:56:14.400
THAT I IDEA CLEARLY THERE'S THE

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:15.435
THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING

01:56:15.501 --> 01:56:16.402
RECOMMENDATIONS HOW HOW'S THAT

01:56:16.469 --> 01:56:17.236
COMING ALONG CAN YOU GIVE US A

01:56:17.303 --> 01:56:18.171
SENSE.

01:56:18.237 --> 01:56:19.839
THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED IN

01:56:19.906 --> 01:56:21.140
THE OVERSIGHT REPORT --

01:56:21.207 --> 01:56:22.308
AND THE RIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS

01:56:22.375 --> 01:56:23.676
THERE AND WE'RE NOT TAKEN UP IN

01:56:23.743 --> 01:56:25.445
ANY SERIOUS AND SUBSTANTIVE WAY

01:56:25.511 --> 01:56:27.513
IN THE REGULATORY PROCESS --

01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:29.115
I WANT TO KNOW WHY WHAT'S WHAT'S

01:56:29.182 --> 01:56:31.984
YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE THE

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:33.720
CONFLICT.

01:56:33.786 --> 01:56:35.054
I DON'T THINK I COULD SPEAK TO A

01:56:35.121 --> 01:56:36.422
ARBY'S PERSPECTIVE ON THAT I

01:56:36.489 --> 01:56:39.225
THINK THE CHALLENGES OF

01:56:39.292 --> 01:56:40.727
INCREASING THE AMBITION OF THIS

01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:42.562
PROGRAM ARE SIGNIFICANT AND

01:56:42.628 --> 01:56:43.996
OBVIOUS AND I SUSPECT THAT'S A

01:56:44.063 --> 01:56:45.398
BIG PART OF IT.

01:56:45.465 --> 01:56:46.966
I ALSO THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM

01:56:47.033 --> 01:56:47.867
WITH THAT THE BOARD IS FRANKLY

01:56:47.934 --> 01:56:49.168
NOT BEING AS TRANSPARENT ABOUT

01:56:49.235 --> 01:56:50.870
ITS STATE OR ACTIONS.

01:56:50.937 --> 01:56:51.838
AS IT NEEDS TO BE IN A CLEAR

01:56:51.904 --> 01:56:53.005
LOOK AT THOSE ACTIONS

01:56:53.072 --> 01:56:54.073
CONTRADICTS A LOT OF THE

01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:55.708
RATIONALES FOR DECISIONS THAT

01:56:55.775 --> 01:56:57.377
HAVE BEEN MADE SO I THINK THAT'S

01:56:57.443 --> 01:56:58.111
IT.

01:56:58.177 --> 01:56:59.979
INHERENTLY A CONTROVERSIAL THING --

01:57:00.046 --> 01:57:01.614
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE BOARD

01:57:01.681 --> 01:57:02.915
IN ADOPTING THE CAPITA RATE

01:57:02.982 --> 01:57:05.251
REGULATIONS ALSO SAID THEY WOULD

01:57:05.318 --> 01:57:05.585
START -- AN

01:57:05.651 --> 01:57:08.888
pYEAR AND I HEARD CHAIR NICHOLS

01:57:08.955 --> 01:57:09.789
TESTIFIED THAT.

01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:11.457
SOMETHING LIKE ANNUAL PROGRAM

01:57:11.524 --> 01:57:13.292
UPDATES MIGHT BE A CONSIDERATION

01:57:13.359 --> 01:57:14.594
SO I'M HOPEFUL ACTUALLY THAT

01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:15.895
THERE'S ROOM FOR OF SERIOUS

01:57:15.962 --> 01:57:17.430
CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE.

01:57:17.497 --> 01:57:18.631
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO

01:57:18.698 --> 01:57:20.199
START REPORTING THE DATA IN A IN

01:57:20.266 --> 01:57:21.801
A WAY THAT --

01:57:21.868 --> 01:57:24.303
FACILITATES A CLEAR I DISCUSS

01:57:24.370 --> 01:57:25.838
BOTH AIR BE AND LEGISLATORS NEED

01:57:25.905 --> 01:57:27.507
TO MAKE ABOUT THE TRADE OFFS

01:57:27.573 --> 01:57:28.207
BETWEEN AMBITION COST

01:57:28.274 --> 01:57:29.375
EFFECTIVENESS.

01:57:29.442 --> 01:57:30.743
A AND SUCCESS ON THE

01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:34.447
ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE.

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:36.015
MMHM WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO

01:57:36.082 --> 01:57:39.819
SEE THE LEGISLATURE DO --

01:57:39.886 --> 01:57:40.820
WHAT WHAT ARE YOU ASKING US TO

01:57:40.887 --> 01:57:43.089
DO ANY PARTICULAR --

01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:45.391
I'LL ALSO TO STEP BACK FROM MY

01:57:45.458 --> 01:57:46.392
ROLE ON THE COMMITTEE WHERE I

01:57:46.459 --> 01:57:48.461
WOULDN'T HAVE ANY POSITION ABOUT

01:57:48.528 --> 01:57:49.562
THAT -- I

01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:50.797
WOULD SAY --

01:57:50.863 --> 01:57:52.532
I THINK CONTINUING THIS

01:57:52.598 --> 01:57:53.800
DISCUSSION IS REALLY IMPORTANT I

01:57:53.866 --> 01:57:55.568
THINK THEIR SPECIFIC ACTIONS

01:57:55.635 --> 01:57:56.502
THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:57:56.569 --> 01:57:57.336
CONSIDER.

01:57:57.403 --> 01:57:58.604
YOU COULD DIRECT THE OVERSIGHT

01:57:58.671 --> 01:57:59.906
COMMITTEE TO ANALYZE SOME OF

01:57:59.972 --> 01:58:01.808
THESE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS.

01:58:01.874 --> 01:58:03.843
YOU COULD APPROPRIATE FUNDS ARE

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:05.478
OR SUGGESTED THAT FUNDS NEED TO

01:58:05.545 --> 01:58:07.146
BE APPROPRIATED TO DO SOME OF

01:58:07.213 --> 01:58:08.614
THE MONITORING AND EVALUTION

01:58:08.681 --> 01:58:10.383
THE DOCTOR BROWN TALKED ABOUT.

01:58:10.450 --> 01:58:11.484
THINK THERE'S BASIC.

01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:12.819
INFRASTRUCTURE QUALITY OF

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:14.620
INFORMATION ISSUES WHERE --

01:58:14.687 --> 01:58:16.022
STATEMENTS FROM THIS COMMITTEE

01:58:16.088 --> 01:58:17.557
OR FROM THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE

01:58:17.623 --> 01:58:20.092
HELPFUL TO ADVANCING A

01:58:20.159 --> 01:58:22.195
CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE ABOUT.

01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:22.929

OBVIOUSLY THE CHAIR OF WAS A

01:59:01.701 --> 01:59:04.237
LITTLE BLEAK BUT SHE DOES SEEM --

01:59:04.303 --> 01:59:06.539

01:59:33.099 --> 01:59:33.900
ENGAGEMENT.

01:59:33.966 --> 01:59:35.234
I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT A WEEK

01:59:35.301 --> 01:59:36.702
AGO THE REGULATOR ISSUED ITS

NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED PAGE

01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:40.273
DOCUMENT DESCRIBING WHY THEY

01:59:40.339 --> 01:59:41.474
WON'T TAKE ANY ACTION ON THESE

01:59:41.541 --> 01:59:41.908
ISSUES.

01:59:41.974 --> 01:59:43.476
AND I WOULD NOT USE ANY OF THE

01:59:43.543 --> 01:59:45.344
THE TERMS YOU JUST DESCRIBED --

01:59:45.411 --> 01:59:46.479
IN IN TALKING ABOUT THAT

01:59:46.546 --> 01:59:47.413
DOCUMENT WHERE IT'S A FAIRLY

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:48.848
COMBATIVE AND DISMISSIVE

01:59:48.915 --> 01:59:51.450
APPROACH. TO UP FAIRLY ENORMOUS

01:59:51.517 --> 01:59:52.351
AMOUNT OF INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE

01:59:52.418 --> 01:59:53.686
FROM MULTIPLE DISINTERESTED

01:59:53.753 --> 01:59:54.754
PARTIES THAT HAS JUST BEEN SORT

01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:56.155
OF DISMISSED.

01:59:56.222 --> 01:59:57.356
AND WHAT WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE

01:59:57.423 --> 01:59:58.925
IN THERE IN THE DOCUMENT.

01:59:58.991 --> 02:00:00.726
I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST LEFT TO

02:00:00.793 --> 02:00:04.330
AIR BE TO THE OBJECTIONS OF THE

02:00:04.397 --> 02:00:05.831
LAST YEAR AND A HALF FOR EXAMPLE

02:00:05.898 --> 02:00:07.366
THIS QUESTION BUT OVER SUPPLIES

02:00:07.433 --> 02:00:08.868
BEEN TO SAY IT'S ALARMIST IT'S

02:00:08.935 --> 02:00:10.403
SPECULATIVE IT'S THE RADICAL.

02:00:10.469 --> 02:00:12.505
WILL NEVER COME TO PASS THE

02:00:12.572 --> 02:00:13.940
FIGURE YOU SAW LA --

02:00:14.006 --> 02:00:14.941
IN AND THE ILLEGAL ALIENS ARE

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:17.276
HAND OUT IS JUST AN IDEA AND WE

02:00:17.343 --> 02:00:19.145
JUST ON OUT FOR WEBER HAPPEN --

02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:20.279
INTO THAT I WOULD SHOW YOU

02:00:20.346 --> 02:00:21.747
FIGURE THREE AND AND MY HAND AT

02:00:21.814 --> 02:00:23.082
WORK AND YOU CAN NOW MEASURE IN

02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.783
A OR B. SOME DATA THAT THE

02:00:23.849 --> 02:00:25.618
PROBLEMS MANIFESTED TO A GREATER

02:00:25.685 --> 02:00:26.419
DEGREE.

02:00:26.485 --> 02:00:30.222
THAN THE WORST CASE ASSUMPTION

02:00:30.289 --> 02:00:31.724
FOR TWENTY TWENTY AS A TWENTY

02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:32.391
EIGHTEEN I THINK AGAIN WHEN ONE

02:00:32.458 --> 02:00:33.459
LOOKS CLEARLY AT THE DATA

02:00:33.526 --> 02:00:35.595
WITHOUT EXPRESSING JUDGMENTS

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:38.030
ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS DATA --

02:00:38.097 --> 02:00:39.532
OF A VERY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION

02:00:39.599 --> 02:00:40.700
BEGINS I HOPE.

02:00:40.766 --> 02:00:42.301
THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE

02:00:42.368 --> 02:00:43.803
CONVERSATION THAT WILL WILL NOW

02:00:43.869 --> 02:00:45.237
UNFOLD.

02:00:45.304 --> 02:00:46.872
AS WE HOPEFULLY MOVE TO A POINT

02:00:46.939 --> 02:00:48.274
WITH KNOWLEDGE THE CURRENT

02:00:48.341 --> 02:00:50.476
MARKET IS NOT THE MARKET THAT'S

02:00:50.543 --> 02:00:52.011
NEEDED. TO ACHIEVE WITH

02:00:52.078 --> 02:00:53.279
IDENTIFIED IN THE SCOPE AND PLAN.

02:00:53.346 --> 02:00:54.914
OUT WHERE ONE GOES FROM THERE --

02:00:54.981 --> 02:00:56.182
THERE ARE IMPORTANT TRADE OFFS

02:00:56.248 --> 02:00:58.718
TO MAKE BUT TO START WITH CLEAR

02:00:58.784 --> 02:00:59.218
DATA I THINK IS A REALLY

02:00:59.285 --> 02:01:03.522
IMPORTANT THING --

02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:04.290

WELL KNOWN TECHNOLOGIST BEEN

02:03:08.047 --> 02:03:09.415
DEVELOPED IN THE CLEAN ENERGY

02:03:09.482 --> 02:03:10.182
SECTOR --

02:03:10.249 --> 02:03:12.184
SOLAR PANEL YOU CAN SEE A

02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:13.652
SNAPSHOT OF HOW THAT TECHNOLOGY

02:03:13.719 --> 02:03:15.354
LOOKS IN EACH STAGE I HOPE IS

02:03:15.421 --> 02:03:17.022
PROVIDE KIND OF A A BIG PICTURE

COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF HOW

02:03:18.524 --> 02:03:19.592
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPS.

02:03:19.658 --> 02:03:22.394
ALONG A VERY EXTENSIVE AND

02:03:22.461 --> 02:03:24.463
SOMETIMES LONG PIPELINE --

02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:25.264
WHEN SPEAKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

02:03:25.331 --> 02:03:25.865
BRAKE THERE IS IT SHOULD BE

02:03:25.931 --> 02:03:27.700
STATED THAT THE EARLIER YOU ARE

02:03:27.767 --> 02:03:29.702
IN THE PIPELINE THE MORE LIKELY

02:03:29.769 --> 02:03:30.903
YOU ARE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

02:03:30.970 --> 02:03:32.605
TECHNOLOGY BREAK THROUGH THIS

02:03:32.671 --> 02:03:33.806
REALLY TO CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE

02:03:33.873 --> 02:03:35.541
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CURRENTLY

02:03:35.608 --> 02:03:37.143
SEE TODAY?

02:03:37.209 --> 02:03:39.178
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TO THE HAND

02:03:39.245 --> 02:03:41.514
OUT WE DISCUSS SOME CHALLENGES

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:42.348
THAT --

02:03:42.414 --> 02:03:44.350
PARTICULARLY CLEAN TECHNOLOGY

02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:46.685
FACES AS IT MOVES THIS PIPELINE.

02:03:46.752 --> 02:03:47.820
THE FIRST AT A CHALLENGE THEIR

02:03:47.887 --> 02:03:49.355
FINANCIAL SO COMPARED TO

02:03:49.421 --> 02:03:50.923
SOFTWARE OR PHARMACEUTICAL

02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:52.858
INVESTMENTS CLEAN TECHNOLOGY IS

02:03:52.925 --> 02:03:53.459
CONSIDERED A VERY HIGH RISK

02:03:53.526 --> 02:03:54.326
INVESTMENT.

02:03:54.393 --> 02:03:56.462
THAT'S PARTLY DUE TO THE LONG

02:03:56.529 --> 02:03:57.763
TIME LINE IT TAKES TO REALIZE

02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:59.064
REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS FROM

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:00.232
CLEAN TECHNOLOGY.

02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:01.700
AND ALSO THE HIGH CAPITAL COST

02:04:01.767 --> 02:04:03.302
REQUIRED UP FRONT PRIVATE

02:04:03.369 --> 02:04:05.404
INVESTMENT THAT'S USUALLY A LOT

02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:06.972
LARGER MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN

02:04:07.039 --> 02:04:08.474
LIKE A SOFTWARE PHARMACEUTICALS.

02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:09.441
THERE'S OTHER POLICY STATE

02:04:09.508 --> 02:04:10.409
POLICIES THAT MIGHT PRESENT

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:12.344
CHALLENGES TO MOVING TECHNOLOGY

02:04:12.411 --> 02:04:13.813
TO THE PIPELINE THESE MIGHT BE

02:04:13.879 --> 02:04:15.347
DUE TO INCONSISTENT IN LOCAL

02:04:15.414 --> 02:04:16.515
PROPERTY POLICIES.

02:04:16.582 --> 02:04:18.450
OR INCONSISTENT RESEARCH

02:04:18.517 --> 02:04:19.385
CONTRACTING PROCEDURES THAT

02:04:19.451 --> 02:04:20.419
WOULD INHIBIT SUMMER BEST

02:04:20.486 --> 02:04:23.989
RESEARCHERS FROM EXPLORING IN

02:04:24.056 --> 02:04:25.391
DEVELOPING THIS TECHNOLOGY --

02:04:25.457 --> 02:04:26.258
WITH CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES ACTUALLY

02:04:26.325 --> 02:04:28.027
NON FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO IF YOU

02:04:28.093 --> 02:04:29.361
THINK ABOUT THE SCIENTISTS

02:04:29.428 --> 02:04:31.397
WORKING IN THE HARD SCIENCES HE

02:04:31.463 --> 02:04:32.231
PHYSICISTS.

02:04:32.298 --> 02:04:32.798
YOU TALK ABOUT ON MATERIAL

02:04:32.865 --> 02:04:35.434
SCIENTISTS HAVE THE SKILL SET TO

02:04:35.501 --> 02:04:37.136
TRANSITION INTO THE

02:04:37.203 --> 02:04:38.437
ENTREPRENEURIAL OR BUSINESS

02:04:38.504 --> 02:04:39.872
SPACE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

02:04:39.939 --> 02:04:41.774
FACILITIES.

02:04:41.841 --> 02:04:43.175
TO DEVELOP A PROTOTYPE OR TO

02:04:43.242 --> 02:04:44.643
MANUFACTURE YOUR SMALL

02:04:44.710 --> 02:04:46.512
DEMONSTRATION PROJECT SO THOSE

02:04:46.579 --> 02:04:47.346
ARE NON FINANCIAL KIND OF

02:04:47.413 --> 02:04:49.348
BARRIERS THAT CLEAN TECHNOLOGY

02:04:49.415 --> 02:04:50.115
FACES AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE

02:04:50.182 --> 02:04:52.084
PIPELINE.

02:04:52.151 --> 02:04:55.554
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE. THREE FOR

02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:56.755
PART OF OUR WORK WE REVIEWED

02:04:56.822 --> 02:04:58.324
WE'VE RECENTLY REVIEWED FORTY

02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:59.959
STATE PROGRAMS.

02:05:00.025 --> 02:05:00.993
THAT PROVIDE FINANCIAL

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:03.195
INCENTIVES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT

02:05:03.262 --> 02:05:04.997
OF CLEAN ENERGY OR CLEAN

02:05:05.064 --> 02:05:06.198
TRANSPORTATION --

02:05:06.265 --> 02:05:07.700
FROM THOSE FORTY PROGRAMS WE

02:05:07.766 --> 02:05:10.469
HAVE ESTIMATED THE CURRENT YEAR

02:05:10.536 --> 02:05:11.437
FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

02:05:11.503 --> 02:05:12.338
FUNDING LEVELS.

02:05:12.404 --> 02:05:14.573
IN WHERE THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE

02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:16.442
SUPPORTING THE PIPELINE IN EACH

02:05:16.508 --> 02:05:17.209
CATEGORY OF THE PIPING THAT WE

02:05:17.276 --> 02:05:19.144
HAVE DESIGNATED --

02:05:19.211 --> 02:05:20.412
IT SHOULD BE NOTED HERE THAT

02:05:20.479 --> 02:05:21.647
ALTHOUGH THE STATE DOES NOT

02:05:21.714 --> 02:05:23.015
REPRESENT DOES NOT --

02:05:23.082 --> 02:05:24.383
SUPPORT FROM MILLER RESEARCH

02:05:24.450 --> 02:05:25.417
THAT FUNDING IS USUALLY

02:05:25.484 --> 02:05:27.486
TYPICALLY PROVIDED BY THE

02:05:27.553 --> 02:05:28.053
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR THREE

02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:31.357
UNIVERSITY.

02:05:31.423 --> 02:05:32.458
AND FINALLY IT FREED ME FROM

02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:33.692
WITH PASSING OF SOME IF YOU HAVE

02:05:33.759 --> 02:05:35.494
ANY QUESTIONS WHEN TRYING TO BE

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:37.429
SENSITIVE TIME HERE.

02:05:37.496 --> 02:05:38.797
FINALLY ON THE LAST PAGE PAGE

02:05:38.864 --> 02:05:39.531
FOR WE HAVE A HANDFUL OF KEY

02:05:39.598 --> 02:05:40.566
ISSUES FOR THE COMMUNITY

02:05:40.633 --> 02:05:42.134
CONSIDER.

02:05:42.201 --> 02:05:42.668
THE FIRST THE FIRST ISSUE

02:05:42.735 --> 02:05:44.003
LOOKING BACK AT THAT --

02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:45.471
TABLE ON PAGE THREE YOU CAN SEE

02:05:45.537 --> 02:05:46.472
THAT THE STATE INVESTMENTS ARE

02:05:46.538 --> 02:05:48.908
PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE LEFT

02:05:48.974 --> 02:05:51.477
THE LAST STAGE OF OF THAT --

02:05:51.543 --> 02:05:52.378
DEPLOYMENT WHICH IS A COMMERCIAL

02:05:52.444 --> 02:05:54.313
DEPLOYMENT.

02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:55.614
EXPERTS TYPICALLY RECOMMEND THAT

02:05:55.681 --> 02:05:57.549
IF PARTICULARLY FOR TRYING TO

02:05:57.616 --> 02:05:59.385
FOSTER TECHNOLOGY BREAKTHROUGHS

02:05:59.451 --> 02:05:59.885
YOU ONE HAVE A BALANCED

02:05:59.952 --> 02:06:01.420
PORTFOLIO APPROACH.

02:06:01.487 --> 02:06:03.222
AND AND KIND OF OPTIMIZE WERE

02:06:03.289 --> 02:06:04.423
YOUR INVESTMENT STRATEGICALLY

02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:05.824
ARE ARE BEING PLACED --

02:06:05.891 --> 02:06:07.526
REFERRING BACK TO THE LA --

02:06:07.593 --> 02:06:09.628
DOCTOR TALKING ABOUT MARKET

02:06:09.695 --> 02:06:11.563
FAILURES FOR CLEAN TECHNOLOGY

02:06:11.630 --> 02:06:13.165
THEY'RE SPECIFICALLY A LARGE

02:06:13.232 --> 02:06:15.167
DROP OFF OF FUNDING FROM THE

02:06:15.234 --> 02:06:16.068
APPLIED RESEARCH THE PROTOTYPE

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:16.902
PHASE.

02:06:16.969 --> 02:06:19.104
THAT'S WERE FEDERAL FUNDS DROP

02:06:19.171 --> 02:06:20.239
OFF AND WE CURRENTLY SEE IN THE

02:06:20.306 --> 02:06:21.407
TABLE DON'T REALLY SPEND A LOT

02:06:21.473 --> 02:06:22.441
OF MONEY IN SUPPORTING THE

02:06:22.508 --> 02:06:24.143
PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT.

02:06:24.209 --> 02:06:25.544
AND THAT'S CONSIDERED A WOULD BE

02:06:25.611 --> 02:06:27.446
CONSIDERED A A MARKET FAILURE IN

02:06:27.513 --> 02:06:29.348
IN THE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH.

02:06:29.415 --> 02:06:30.983
ALSO REVIEWING OUR THE PROGRAM

02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:32.418
TO FIND IF THERE IS LIKELY

02:06:32.484 --> 02:06:34.053
PROGRAM OVERLAP SPECIFICALLY ON

02:06:34.119 --> 02:06:35.220
THE PROGRAMS ARE TARGETING

02:06:35.287 --> 02:06:36.755
ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

02:06:36.822 --> 02:06:38.390
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ELECTRIC

02:06:38.457 --> 02:06:39.858
VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THOSE

02:06:39.925 --> 02:06:41.627
A TARGET LOW INCOME CONSUMERS.

02:06:41.694 --> 02:06:43.562
AND PROGRAM OVERLAP CAN PRODUCE

02:06:43.629 --> 02:06:45.965
INEFFICIENCIES INEFFECTIVENESS

02:06:46.031 --> 02:06:47.333
OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

02:06:47.399 --> 02:06:48.467
INTENDED TO SUPPORT THIS

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:50.402
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT.

02:06:50.469 --> 02:06:51.337
WE ALSO FIND THOSE

02:06:51.403 --> 02:06:52.171
INCONSISTENCIES ACROSS STATE

02:06:52.237 --> 02:06:53.772
AGENCIES AND HOW THEY HANDLE

02:06:53.839 --> 02:06:54.373
THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:55.374
POLICIES.

02:06:55.441 --> 02:06:56.575
AND THE RESEARCH CONTRACTING

02:06:56.642 --> 02:06:58.677
PROCEDURES PARTICULARLY OF IP

02:06:58.744 --> 02:07:00.746
POLICY THERE IS NO STATEWIDE I

02:07:00.813 --> 02:07:03.082
POLICY RIGHT NOW SO EVERY --

02:07:03.148 --> 02:07:04.350
AGENCY THAT THAT'S THE

02:07:04.416 --> 02:07:05.384
MINISTRY'S HAD A KIND OF GRANTS

02:07:05.451 --> 02:07:07.086
ARE BASICALLY REINVENTING THE

02:07:07.152 --> 02:07:08.520
WHEEL EVERY SINGLE TIME.

02:07:08.587 --> 02:07:09.855
AND THERE HAS BEEN EVIDENCE THAT

02:07:09.922 --> 02:07:12.791
SHOWN THAT I'M CLEAR IP POLICIES

02:07:12.858 --> 02:07:14.426
AND RULES REQUIREMENTS OF LIKELY

02:07:14.493 --> 02:07:16.161
LEAD TO THE DISCOURAGED MEANT.

02:07:16.228 --> 02:07:17.496
A VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT

02:07:17.563 --> 02:07:18.764
THAT'S SO CRITICAL IN THAT

02:07:18.831 --> 02:07:20.265
PROTOTYPE PHASE --

02:07:20.332 --> 02:07:21.166
IN OUR CLEAN TECHNOLOGY

02:07:21.233 --> 02:07:22.301
DEVELOPMENT.

WHO WOULD WHO WOULD PROMULGATE

02:07:37.383 --> 02:07:38.183
THAT THE STATE AGENCY ID

02:07:38.250 --> 02:07:39.418
POLICIES ACT THAT'S ON IN THE

02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:42.187
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE COULD DO?

02:07:42.254 --> 02:07:43.522
THAT'S SOMETHING TO LIKE SUCH A

02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:44.690
GOOD DEAL AS AN ADVISER YES YES

LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY POLICY AND

02:09:04.503 --> 02:09:05.504
SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY IN ENERGY

02:09:05.571 --> 02:09:06.939
EFFICIENCY SEARCH.

02:09:07.005 --> 02:09:07.840
HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT

02:09:07.906 --> 02:09:10.175
CONTRIBUTOR TO SOMETHING CALLED

02:09:10.242 --> 02:09:12.077
A DOZEN FROZEN FOR EFFECT.

02:09:12.144 --> 02:09:12.711
THE FACT THAT PARK UP

ELECTRICITY USE IN CALIFORNIA

02:09:14.413 --> 02:09:16.949
HAS NOT INCREASED FOR DECADES.

02:09:17.015 --> 02:09:18.450
WHAT IT DOES INCLUDE A 50% REST

02:09:18.517 --> 02:09:20.419
OF THE COUNTRY?

02:09:20.486 --> 02:09:22.688
UP IS IS STARTING IN NINETEEN

02:09:22.754 --> 02:09:24.523
SEVENTY THE COMPANIES OF OF A

02:09:24.590 --> 02:09:26.425
NINETEEN SEVENTIES A PRODUCTIVE

USE OF WHAT IF I LIKE TO CITY

02:09:28.594 --> 02:09:30.496
ELECTRICITY I GUESS.

02:09:30.562 --> 02:09:33.232
UP UP AND THAT IS PRIMARILY

02:09:33.298 --> 02:09:34.366
BECAUSE THE RULES IN FULL EFFECT

02:09:34.433 --> 02:09:36.935
ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY --

02:09:37.002 --> 02:09:37.569
IMPROVEMENT IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY

02:09:37.636 --> 02:09:38.537
[inaudible]

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:40.472
UP.

TECHNOLOGY AREA AT BERKELEY LAB.

02:09:46.211 --> 02:09:47.045
THIS PARTICULAR AT SUCH AREA OF

02:09:47.112 --> 02:09:48.313
THE LAB IS COMPRISED OF MORE

02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:49.648
THAN SEVEN HUNDRED RESEARCHERS

02:09:49.715 --> 02:09:51.450
AND STOP.

02:09:51.517 --> 02:09:52.518
WHO SPEND THEIR PROFESSIONAL

LIVES PURSUING THE ANSWERS TO

02:09:53.752 --> 02:09:54.753
SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:57.523
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE TODAY?

02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:58.790
I IN ADDITION TO OUR PRIMARY

02:09:58.857 --> 02:10:00.993
WILL PRODUCE FUNDED BY.

02:10:01.059 --> 02:10:03.028
PRIMARILY BY THE BOTTOM ENERGY

02:10:03.095 --> 02:10:04.730
MUCH OF THIS RESEARCH IS ALSO.

02:10:04.796 --> 02:10:06.431
COMPUTER THE SUPPORT FROM THE

02:10:06.498 --> 02:10:08.433
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:10.969
MOST IMPACTFUL LEAVE BEFORE NAY

02:10:11.036 --> 02:10:13.338
FROM CALIFORNIA IS A COMMISSION.

02:10:13.405 --> 02:10:14.606
EPIC PROGRAM WHICH IS FORMALLY

02:10:14.673 --> 02:10:16.441
KNOWN AS THE PIPP PROGRAM.

02:10:16.508 --> 02:10:19.745
AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO TIE

02:10:19.811 --> 02:10:22.214
OUTGOING CHAIRMAN VISOR MILLER.

02:10:22.281 --> 02:10:24.249
AND AND THE INCOMING TEACHERS ON

02:10:24.316 --> 02:10:25.617
MEN HAWK SHIELD.

02:10:25.684 --> 02:10:27.352
FOR THE TIRELESS WORK UNDERSTAND

02:10:27.419 --> 02:10:28.287
THE CHALLENGES CALIFORNIA

02:10:28.353 --> 02:10:31.089
ADVANCED TO SUPPORT RESEARCH

02:10:31.156 --> 02:10:31.690
THAT DEMONSTRATES SOLUTION TO

02:10:31.757 --> 02:10:33.225
THOSE.

02:10:33.292 --> 02:10:34.560
CHALLENGES JUST TO GIVE AN

02:10:34.626 --> 02:10:35.727
EXAMPLE.

02:10:35.794 --> 02:10:36.562
WELL THE AP PROJECTS FUNDED IN

02:10:36.628 --> 02:10:38.463
YOUR DISTRICT.

02:10:38.530 --> 02:10:40.799
OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THAT THE

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:42.501
TECHNICAL POTENTIAL THE TO

02:10:42.568 --> 02:10:43.168
CANNOT CONNECT ECONOMIC

02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:45.437
POTENTIAL OFF OF THE ONE DOLLAR

02:10:45.504 --> 02:10:46.905
INVESTED IN RESEARCH.

02:10:46.972 --> 02:10:48.674
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:50.175
ALMOST HUNDRED DOLLARS SAVINGS.

02:10:50.242 --> 02:10:51.810
AND THAT IS A TESTAMENT TO THE

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:54.046
FACT THAT.

02:10:54.112 --> 02:10:57.416
FUNDING RESEARCH BEES OFF.

02:10:57.482 --> 02:10:58.550
NOT ORDER THANK GOD --

02:10:58.617 --> 02:11:00.352
CAUGHT YOUR MILLION NICHOLS FOR

02:11:00.419 --> 02:11:01.420
BECAUSE SCOTT WAS A SUPPORTS

02:11:01.486 --> 02:11:02.888
QUITE A BIT OF RESEARCH AT THE

02:11:02.955 --> 02:11:05.657
LAB INTENSE AND DOING A LOT OF

02:11:05.724 --> 02:11:07.726
DIFFERENT AND MOMENT ANALYSIS.

02:11:07.793 --> 02:11:09.161
NOT GOING BACK TO THE TOPIC OF

02:11:09.228 --> 02:11:11.563
THE DAY AT WATER DONE HE SAYS

02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:13.432
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY NEEDS AND

02:11:13.498 --> 02:11:15.934
WELL THE GAPS IN DUMPS A MEETING

02:11:16.001 --> 02:11:16.969
THERE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS.

02:11:17.035 --> 02:11:17.603
I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW

02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:19.371
THINGS.

02:11:19.438 --> 02:11:21.073
FIRST OF ALL YOU MAY KNOW THAT

02:11:21.139 --> 02:11:24.243
THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

02:11:24.309 --> 02:11:24.810
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ALREADY

02:11:24.876 --> 02:11:26.078
MADE A TWENTY TWENTY TARGET

02:11:26.144 --> 02:11:26.912
WHICH IS VERY COMMENDABLE VERY

02:11:26.979 --> 02:11:28.880
COMMENDABLE FEAT.

02:11:28.947 --> 02:11:31.183
NOW THE QUESTION IS FROM HERE TO

02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:32.451
TWENTY THIRTY WHAT ELSE WHAT ARE

02:11:32.517 --> 02:11:36.221
THE THINGS THAT NEEDED.

02:11:36.288 --> 02:11:37.756
SO FOR ACHIEVING THAT TWENTY

02:11:37.823 --> 02:11:38.890
THIRTY GOALS WE WILL NEED A

02:11:38.957 --> 02:11:40.659
MULTI PRONGED APPROACH.

02:11:40.726 --> 02:11:42.561
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO DATE DE

02:11:42.628 --> 02:11:45.130
CARBONIZED TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.

02:11:45.197 --> 02:11:46.698
OF THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND THE

02:11:46.765 --> 02:11:47.899
BUILDING SECTOR BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:11:47.966 --> 02:11:50.602
THE TOP THREE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:53.205
EMITTERS IN THE STATE.

02:11:53.272 --> 02:11:54.940
BUILDING HEATING IS PRIMARILY

02:11:55.007 --> 02:11:57.042
BASED ON NATURAL GAS AND I THINK

02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:58.377
I BELIEVE I HEARD SOME

02:11:58.443 --> 02:11:59.544
DISCUSSION RELATED TO THAT

02:11:59.611 --> 02:12:00.846
EARLIER TODAY YEAH.

02:12:00.912 --> 02:12:02.047
AND SO ELECTRIFICATION A

02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:03.882
BUILDING HEATING VERY VERY VERY

02:12:03.949 --> 02:12:05.617
IMPORTANT IN ACHIEVING FUTURE.

02:12:05.684 --> 02:12:09.288
DAMAGING GOALS OF CALIFORNIA.

02:12:09.354 --> 02:12:10.522
IT ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO

02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:11.790
UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF NON

02:12:11.857 --> 02:12:13.992
CARBON DIOXIDE REYES GOT A

02:12:14.059 --> 02:12:16.995
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:17.829
A PARTICULARLY FROM THE CRITICAL

02:12:17.896 --> 02:12:21.800
JUST SECTOR AND REFRIGERATION.

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:23.902
OR DO YOU TO PLEASE TO US

02:12:23.969 --> 02:12:25.003
SOMEONE HE'D RAVES ARE THERE IS

02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:26.471
SIGNIFICANT REQUIREMENT FOR AIR

02:12:26.538 --> 02:12:28.173
CONDITIONING IN IN THE STATE OF

02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:30.375
CALIFORNIA.

02:12:30.442 --> 02:12:32.377
AND AND THE REFRIGERANT THAT WE

02:12:32.444 --> 02:12:34.112
USE TODAY HAVE A VERY HIGH

02:12:34.179 --> 02:12:35.580
GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AS

02:12:35.647 --> 02:12:38.917
COMPARED TO COVERED EXCITE.

02:12:38.984 --> 02:12:40.385
THAT'S AND I THINK THAT YOU HAVE

02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:41.086
TO DATE BE A LOT OF ATTENTION

02:12:41.153 --> 02:12:41.520
[inaudible]

02:12:41.586 --> 02:12:43.722
TO UP.

02:12:43.789 --> 02:12:45.157
SWITCHING TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

02:12:45.223 --> 02:12:46.224
TO RENEWABLE RESOURCES IS IS

02:12:46.291 --> 02:12:47.559
VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALL

02:12:47.626 --> 02:12:49.494
THE DATA INDICATE THAT THAT IN

02:12:49.561 --> 02:12:53.031
FACT A THE THE THE FUEL USE AND

02:12:53.098 --> 02:12:54.666
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IN IN

02:12:54.733 --> 02:12:56.301
CALIFORNIA'S INCREASING.

02:12:56.368 --> 02:12:57.636
AND AND AND SO IT'S VERY

02:12:57.703 --> 02:12:59.438
IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU WANT TO

02:12:59.504 --> 02:13:01.139
ACHIEVE THESE TARGETS THE SWITCH

02:13:01.206 --> 02:13:02.708
TO RENEWABLE.

02:13:02.774 --> 02:13:03.108
ENERGY SOURCES FOR

02:13:03.175 --> 02:13:05.811
TRANSPORTATION.

02:13:05.877 --> 02:13:08.146
ALSO I END UP TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

02:13:08.213 --> 02:13:10.248
A VERY AGGRESSIVE OBVIOUS

02:13:10.315 --> 02:13:12.317
JUNIPER BEFORE YOUR GOALS.

02:13:12.384 --> 02:13:14.419
AND IN OUR OPINION THE RESEARCH

02:13:14.486 --> 02:13:16.655
SHOWS THAT THE DOCTOR PROBLEM

02:13:16.722 --> 02:13:19.157
VERY BECOME WHAT'S MORE

02:13:19.224 --> 02:13:21.493
PENETRATION OF INTERVAL.

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:22.127
SO WE HAVE TO FOLLOW

02:13:22.194 --> 02:13:23.395
TECHNOLOGIES AND STRATEGIES TO

02:13:23.462 --> 02:13:24.496
SOLVE THE DARKER PROBLEM

02:13:24.563 --> 02:13:25.564
[inaudible]

02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:27.232
I'D UP.

02:13:27.299 --> 02:13:28.533
CLOSE THE CONVERSION EXTENT

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:30.836
STORAGE BASICALLY I'LL TALK

02:13:30.902 --> 02:13:32.571
ABOUT THE DENTIST COMBINATION OF

02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:34.473
STORIES AS WELL AS HOW DO YOU

02:13:34.539 --> 02:13:36.208
MANAGE THE NOTES IN THE BUILDING

02:13:36.274 --> 02:13:39.378
A HOUSE AND AND A COMBINATION OF

02:13:39.444 --> 02:13:39.911
BOTH THE STRATEGIES RIGHT

02:13:39.978 --> 02:13:40.412
[inaudible]

02:13:40.479 --> 02:13:43.115
UP.

02:13:43.181 --> 02:13:45.384
THE CONVERSION OF THE GOD A

02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:45.984
CULTURAL FOR US A SOLID WASTE

02:13:46.051 --> 02:13:48.387
STREAMS.

02:13:48.453 --> 02:13:49.488
AS WELL AS YOU DO A SHORT LIVED

02:13:49.554 --> 02:13:51.223
CLIMATE POLLUTANTS LIKE METHANE.

02:13:51.289 --> 02:13:53.191
INTO VALUABLE CARBON NEGATIVE

02:13:53.258 --> 02:13:54.993
AND GOVERNOR TO BUY YOUR FIELDS

02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:56.962
AND BIOPRODUCTS.

02:13:57.028 --> 02:13:59.030
USING BIOTECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO

02:13:59.097 --> 02:14:00.532
VERY IMPORTANT.

02:14:00.599 --> 02:14:01.533
BUT IT FACES SOME UNIQUE

02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:03.502
TECHNICAL CHALLENGES WHICH

02:14:03.568 --> 02:14:04.369
REQUEST FOR THE RESEARCH AND IT

02:14:04.436 --> 02:14:05.404
GOES BACK TO WHAT MR NICHOLS WAS

02:14:05.470 --> 02:14:06.538
SAYING.

02:14:06.605 --> 02:14:08.240
THAT IT IS OVERLY STUDIOUS AS

02:14:08.306 --> 02:14:10.609
WHICH IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE SOME

02:14:10.675 --> 02:14:14.513
OF THOSE BREAKTHROUGHS.

02:14:14.579 --> 02:14:17.549
AND FINALLY IN TOM SAW FOR THE

02:14:17.616 --> 02:14:20.218
ENERGY.

02:14:20.285 --> 02:14:21.219
OR DOING OF WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

02:14:21.286 --> 02:14:22.120
CHALLENGES ONE THING WHICH I

02:14:22.187 --> 02:14:22.988
WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS V.

02:14:23.054 --> 02:14:24.389
ALSO MUST DRAMATICALLY REDUCE

02:14:24.456 --> 02:14:27.492
ENERGY USE ASSOCIATED.

02:14:27.559 --> 02:14:29.761
MOVING IN THE AD THE SALINITY

02:14:29.828 --> 02:14:30.495
WATER THAT SCARED BECAUSE

02:14:30.562 --> 02:14:33.331
DESALINATION OF WATER IT IS VERY

02:14:33.398 --> 02:14:38.470
VERY AND AND AND MANAGEMENT.

02:14:38.537 --> 02:14:39.538
SO.

02:14:39.604 --> 02:14:41.373
LBNL THE BERKELEY LAB HAS BEEN

02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:42.441
PARTNERING WITH CALIFORNIA

02:14:42.507 --> 02:14:43.208
UTILITIES AND PRIVATE SECTOR

02:14:43.275 --> 02:14:44.543
PARTNERS TO CREATE FLEXIBLE

02:14:44.609 --> 02:14:47.045
BUILDING AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMER.

02:14:47.112 --> 02:14:48.914
ENERGY LOADS.

02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:50.715
THAT CAN HELP INTEGRATE MORE

02:14:50.782 --> 02:14:53.518
RENEWABLE ENERGY TO THE GRID.

02:14:53.585 --> 02:14:55.387
UP FOR EXAMPLE SIMILAR POLITICAL

02:14:55.454 --> 02:14:57.122
ENERGY STORAGE MANY CUSTOMER

02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:59.090
LORD SUCH AIR CONDITIONING.

02:14:59.157 --> 02:15:01.126
OR WATER HEATING CAN BE CHARGED

02:15:01.193 --> 02:15:03.295
AND DISCHARGED RIGHT AND THAT

02:15:03.361 --> 02:15:05.163
COULD YOU CAN MATCH IT WITH A

02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:05.664
SWORD OR LOOK A SORT OF

02:15:05.730 --> 02:15:07.999
GENERATION.

02:15:08.066 --> 02:15:10.435
ALL MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED

02:15:10.502 --> 02:15:12.471
OLDER TO DEVELOP COMMON OPEN

02:15:12.537 --> 02:15:13.472
INTEROPERABLE METHODS FOR

02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:15.640
CONTROLLING AND COMMUNICATING

02:15:15.707 --> 02:15:20.145
WITH THE CUSTOMER AND USE LOTS.

02:15:20.212 --> 02:15:22.280
R. L. BEEN AND AN L. IS ALSO THE

02:15:22.347 --> 02:15:24.583
BURKE LABS AS CONTINUING FORM

02:15:24.649 --> 02:15:27.219
WHAT FUNDED BY A CITY YOU SEE.

02:15:27.285 --> 02:15:29.654
TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF DEMAND

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:32.457
TO SPONSOR RESOURCES.

02:15:32.524 --> 02:15:34.459
UP RESOURCE POTENTIAL INCLUDING

02:15:34.526 --> 02:15:36.261
SHIPPING LORDS WITH DYNAMIC

02:15:36.328 --> 02:15:38.196
PRICING AND SHIFTING DEMAND.

02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:39.297
DOCTOR Y USE OF RENEWABLE

02:15:39.364 --> 02:15:41.533
ENERGY SO THAT'S ONE STRATEGY

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:44.536
HOW DO YOU MIND IS THE LOOK.

02:15:44.603 --> 02:15:45.337
SECOND STUDY AS YOU POINTED OUT

02:15:45.403 --> 02:15:48.573
IS ENERGY STORAGE.

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.675
UP SO THE BERKELEY LAB AND OTHER

02:15:50.742 --> 02:15:52.444
COLLEAGUES OF OTHER LABS AND THE

02:15:52.511 --> 02:15:53.845
GOVERNMENT'S TRADITIONS AND EVEN

02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:55.480
A PRIVATE RESEARCH LABS.

02:15:55.547 --> 02:15:56.248
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON VARIOUS

02:15:56.314 --> 02:15:57.549
ENERGY SOURCE TECHNOLOGIES

02:15:57.616 --> 02:15:59.150
INCLUDING ELECTROCHEMICAL SORT

02:15:59.217 --> 02:16:01.553

CHALLENGES ELECTROCHEMICAL

02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:05.891
STORAGE SUCH A LEAVE HIM ON

02:16:05.957 --> 02:16:07.359
BATTERY.

02:16:07.425 --> 02:16:09.194
IS GOING TO BE SAFETY AND THIS

02:16:09.261 --> 02:16:11.263
CASA DEAL CRITICAL MATERIAL SUCH

02:16:11.329 --> 02:16:12.864
AS CORD AND I HEARD IT IN THE

02:16:12.931 --> 02:16:15.033
FEWEST BOTTLE THAT WAS DISCUSSED

02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:16.635
QUITE A BIT.

02:16:16.701 --> 02:16:17.135
AND WHICH IS A SEE THIS

02:16:17.202 --> 02:16:20.472
CHALLENGE.

02:16:20.539 --> 02:16:21.907
V. HAVE ACTUALLY EMBARKED OR

02:16:21.973 --> 02:16:23.441
DELETE FUNDED PROGRAM TO SOLVE

02:16:23.508 --> 02:16:25.443
ALL THESE PROBLEMS DISCUSSES THE

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:28.079
RESOURCES OF THE COURT WHICH IS

02:16:28.146 --> 02:16:30.782
ABOUT YOU SIGNIFICANTLY IN

02:16:30.849 --> 02:16:32.551
TODAY'S THE TIME ABOUT.

02:16:32.617 --> 02:16:34.019
THREE THE TWO APPROACHES ONE IS

02:16:34.085 --> 02:16:37.289
HOW DO YOU DO FOR A DOUBLE UP.

02:16:37.355 --> 02:16:39.124
A LITTLE ABOUT THE WAS DOES NOT

02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:41.459
USE ANY COURT THAT'S CRITICAL

02:16:41.526 --> 02:16:42.994
WARD FORGET HIM ON BATTERY.

02:16:43.061 --> 02:16:45.430
AND SECOND ONE IS A RECYCLING

02:16:45.497 --> 02:16:47.432
GOLF THE CURRENTLY COMING

02:16:47.499 --> 02:16:48.433
BATTERIES SO THAT HE COULD

02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:50.235
RETRIEVE A LOT OF THESE MINERALS

02:16:50.302 --> 02:16:53.104
FROM THE OF THE FOR THE THE THE

02:16:53.171 --> 02:16:55.774
THE BATTERIES THESE ARE BOTH

02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:56.374
GOING TO PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT

02:16:56.441 --> 02:16:58.443
ROLE IN THE FUTURE.

02:16:58.510 --> 02:17:01.012
AND AT THE SAME TIME THOMAS

02:17:01.079 --> 02:17:02.781
STORAGE IS ANOTHER STRATEGY IF

02:17:02.847 --> 02:17:04.115
YOU LOOK AT THE BUILDING.

02:17:04.182 --> 02:17:06.084
ALMOST 50% ENERGY GOES IN

02:17:06.151 --> 02:17:08.520
HEATING OR COOLING.

02:17:08.587 --> 02:17:09.988
SO THOMAS STORAGE CAN BE ANOTHER

02:17:10.055 --> 02:17:16.494
VIABLE OPTION SO THEY CAN

02:17:16.561 --> 02:17:17.162
PROVIDE FOR TO DISTRIBUTE IT AND

02:17:17.228 --> 02:17:18.029
THE DISTORTED.

02:17:18.096 --> 02:17:19.831
AS WELL AS CAN PROVIDE VERY ZONA

02:17:19.898 --> 02:17:21.232
CLIMATE CONDITIONING OF THE

02:17:21.299 --> 02:17:22.634
BUILDING WHICH WILL LEAD TO

02:17:22.701 --> 02:17:25.203
SIGNIFICANT.

02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:28.373
A NEW A OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE IN

02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:28.974
THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THE

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:31.610
BUILDING RIGHT RIGHT.

02:17:31.676 --> 02:17:33.578
AND FINALLY ONE ONE TO ADMIT IT

02:17:33.645 --> 02:17:34.613
BUT I'M SURE AS HELL PEOPLE

02:17:34.679 --> 02:17:36.514
MIGHT WANT TO HAVE THEIR BEDROOM

02:17:36.581 --> 02:17:38.049
WARM IS AT EIGHT BUT THEY DON'T

02:17:38.116 --> 02:17:42.520
NEED THE LIVING ROOM THAT THEY

02:17:42.587 --> 02:17:44.556
DON'T NEED THAT EVEN TO THE ALL

02:17:44.623 --> 02:17:46.758
THIS RESOURCE YES YOU KNOW HOUSE

02:17:46.825 --> 02:17:47.459
WARM YES.

02:17:47.525 --> 02:17:49.361
YOU'RE NOT THAT CAN BE ENABLED

02:17:49.427 --> 02:17:50.595
IF YOU HAVE A STORAGE IN THE IN

02:17:50.662 --> 02:17:53.398
THE WALLS OF THE BUILDING.

02:17:53.465 --> 02:17:54.132
AND AND ONE AND LOST ONE AND

02:17:54.199 --> 02:17:55.567
REYES STRATEGY IS SOMETHING ON

02:17:55.634 --> 02:17:57.202
THE GRID INTERACTIVE EFFICIENT

02:17:57.268 --> 02:17:58.870
BUILDING SO TODAY.

02:17:58.937 --> 02:17:59.371
IF YOU LOOK AT A BROADLY

02:17:59.437 --> 02:18:02.040
SPEAKING.

02:18:02.107 --> 02:18:03.508
LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF THE

02:18:03.575 --> 02:18:05.477
BURNING BODIES SEPARATE AND

02:18:05.543 --> 02:18:06.511
WALKED IN THE SUPPLY FROM THE

02:18:06.578 --> 02:18:07.445
GREAT.

02:18:07.512 --> 02:18:09.180
BUT WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:11.082
OUR IS THE EFFICIENCY OF THE

02:18:11.149 --> 02:18:12.784
SYSTEM LEVEL YOU'RE ARE SCANNED

02:18:12.851 --> 02:18:14.185
THE BUILDING CONTINUOUSLY

02:18:14.252 --> 02:18:15.787
INTERACT WITH THE GOOD.

02:18:15.854 --> 02:18:16.321
SO THAT WE HAVE A HIGHLY

02:18:16.388 --> 02:18:17.856
EFFICIENT.

02:18:17.922 --> 02:18:20.125
SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDE BORDER OF

02:18:20.191 --> 02:18:21.426
THE DEMAND SIDE AND THE SUPPLY

02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:21.993
SIDE AND LOOKING AT I VERY

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:23.128
HOLISTICALLY.

02:18:23.194 --> 02:18:23.695
AND IN FACT DEPARTMENT OF

02:18:23.762 --> 02:18:25.163
ENERGY'S DIVERTING SIGNIFICANTLY

02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:27.699
IN THAT DIRECTION BEFORE NEED A

02:18:27.766 --> 02:18:28.633
LOT OF RESEARCH IS SOMETHING

02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:31.202
CALLED A GRID INTERACTIVE

02:18:31.269 --> 02:18:35.073
EFFICIENT BUILDINGS YEAH.

02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:36.608
UP CONTRIBUTOR A MUCH TIME I

02:18:36.675 --> 02:18:38.376
JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE THAT UP

02:18:38.443 --> 02:18:39.644
YOU KNOW V. DIVIDE THE STATE HAS

02:18:39.711 --> 02:18:41.513
MADE ENORMOUS PROGRESS IN

02:18:41.579 --> 02:18:44.449
ACHIEVING DEEP REDUCTIONS.

02:18:44.516 --> 02:18:47.419
UP IENEN VIEILLE NEEDED A CgA

02:18:47.485 --> 02:18:49.721
A ROBUST MULTI PRONG STUDY

02:18:49.788 --> 02:18:52.424
TOUCHES DEDUCTIONS.

02:18:52.490 --> 02:18:55.427
AND I WANT TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL

02:18:55.493 --> 02:18:57.429
WHAT ROLE MR DICK UPSET.

02:18:57.495 --> 02:18:59.064
BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN AT LEAST

02:18:59.130 --> 02:19:00.131
IN MY OPINION IN THE FREE LOVE

02:19:00.198 --> 02:19:02.300
CANADIAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY IS

02:19:02.367 --> 02:19:04.469
THAT IF THERE IS A NEW BIXEL

02:19:04.536 --> 02:19:04.903
TODAY.

02:19:04.969 --> 02:19:06.204
IT TAKES ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS

02:19:06.271 --> 02:19:07.272
FOR THAT BREAK THROUGH THE

02:19:07.338 --> 02:19:08.640
MATERIALIZE INTO A VIABLE MARKET

02:19:08.707 --> 02:19:14.813
READY TECHNOLOGIES RESOLUTION A

02:19:14.879 --> 02:19:16.147
STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN PLAY A

02:19:16.214 --> 02:19:17.582
VERY SIGNIFICANT ROLE. TO TO

02:19:17.649 --> 02:19:20.385
BRIDGE THAT GAP.

02:19:20.452 --> 02:19:21.786
AND UNDER THAT I'LL JUST MOVE

02:19:21.853 --> 02:19:23.354
FUNDING BUT FUNDING OF COURSE

02:19:23.421 --> 02:19:23.621
YES MA'AM.

02:19:23.688 --> 02:19:26.124
YEAH BUT WITH THE BE SURELY THE

02:19:26.191 --> 02:19:27.258
SAME REASONS WHY IT'S HARD TO

02:19:27.325 --> 02:19:28.727
GET PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING

02:19:28.793 --> 02:19:29.527
BECAUSE IT'S SO SPECULATIVE

02:19:29.594 --> 02:19:30.829
RIGHT.

02:19:30.895 --> 02:19:32.597
MILT EMILY HOW HOW DOES HOW DOES

02:19:32.664 --> 02:19:34.232
THE STATE FIGURE OUT A WAY OF

02:19:34.299 --> 02:19:36.167
PICKING LOSE I I CAN I IF YOU

02:19:36.234 --> 02:19:37.502
LOOK AT IT IT'S NOT AS YOU

02:19:37.569 --> 02:19:39.404
TECHNOLOGY I THINK I WILL

02:19:39.471 --> 02:19:41.206
BROUGHT UNDER TO ANY HARDWARE

02:19:41.272 --> 02:19:42.707
TECHNOLOGY.

02:19:42.774 --> 02:19:44.409
IT TAKES A LOT OF EMPIRICAL DATA

02:19:44.476 --> 02:19:46.211
SUGGESTS THAT IT TAKES ROUGHLY

02:19:46.277 --> 02:19:47.312
FIFTEEN TO TWENTY IS EVEN

02:19:47.378 --> 02:19:48.379
RESPECTIVE OFF THE END OF

02:19:48.446 --> 02:19:50.448
LOCATION.

02:19:50.515 --> 02:19:51.316
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO

02:19:51.382 --> 02:19:53.318
LOOK AT NEXT COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY

02:19:53.384 --> 02:19:54.452
STILL TO GET FIFTEEN TO TWENTY

02:19:54.519 --> 02:19:55.754
YEARS.

02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:56.755
BECAUSE HARDWARE IS JUST A

02:19:56.821 --> 02:19:58.189
TALENTED IS A LOT OF TRIAL AND

02:19:58.256 --> 02:19:58.423
ERROR.

02:19:58.490 --> 02:19:59.557
SO ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH WE

02:19:59.624 --> 02:20:02.494
HAVE STARTED AT THE LOT AND

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:03.428
ORDERED PARTS OF DEAL HE HAS

02:20:03.495 --> 02:20:05.063
STARTED LOOKING INTO SOMETHING

02:20:05.130 --> 02:20:06.498
CALL SIGNS OF SKILL UP.

02:20:06.564 --> 02:20:08.566
HOW DO YOU START DOING A LAW OF

02:20:08.633 --> 02:20:09.567
SINES RIGHT IN THE BIG INTO

02:20:09.634 --> 02:20:11.436
UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE

02:20:11.503 --> 02:20:14.439
CHALLENGES THAT YOU WOULD FACING

02:20:14.506 --> 02:20:17.475
SKINNING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY?

02:20:17.542 --> 02:20:18.376
SO RATHER THAN GOING FROM A

02:20:18.443 --> 02:20:20.345
LINEAR MODEL OF INNOVATION VERY

02:20:20.411 --> 02:20:22.147
OF DISCOVERY THAN.

02:20:22.213 --> 02:20:25.083
ENGINEERING THAT MARKET LOOKING

02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:27.819
OVER THE CIRCULAR MORTAL OFF OFF

02:20:27.886 --> 02:20:29.354
OFF ARE DOING --

02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:30.655
OF THE DISCOVERY TO DEVICES.

02:20:30.722 --> 02:20:31.856
AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WHICH I

02:20:31.923 --> 02:20:33.258
WOULD SAY IS IS A PARADIGM SHIFT

02:20:33.324 --> 02:20:33.992
IN HOW YOU DO.

02:20:34.058 --> 02:20:36.227
A TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND I'M

02:20:36.294 --> 02:20:36.995
FINDING IT IS A QUITE FRANKLY

02:20:37.061 --> 02:20:41.199
WILL HAVE TO SUPPORT THAT KIND

02:20:41.266 --> 02:20:44.202
OF A MODEL IF.

02:20:44.269 --> 02:20:46.504
THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT

02:20:46.571 --> 02:20:48.506
I'VE NEXT THAT TO HEAR FROM A

02:20:48.573 --> 02:20:49.808
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE TALK ABOUT

02:20:49.874 --> 02:20:51.476
ANOTHER INTERESTING SERIES OF

02:20:51.543 --> 02:20:54.479
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND

02:20:54.546 --> 02:20:54.779
DOCTOR BONE.

02:20:54.846 --> 02:20:56.481
THANK YOU.

02:20:56.548 --> 02:20:57.048
CAROLYN AND MEMBERS OF THE

02:20:57.115 --> 02:20:57.649
COMMITTEE.

02:20:57.715 --> 02:20:58.716
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS

02:20:58.783 --> 02:21:00.251
OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE LAWRENCE

02:21:00.318 --> 02:21:02.053
LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABS THOUGHT

02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:04.389
ON SOME TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE

02:21:04.455 --> 02:21:05.790
BELIEVE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

02:21:05.857 --> 02:21:06.658
PURSUE TO REACH SOME OF ITS

02:21:06.724 --> 02:21:08.560
CLIMATE GOALS.

02:21:08.626 --> 02:21:09.661
MY NAME IS STEVE BOWLING ALLEY

02:21:09.727 --> 02:21:12.530
THE ENERGY AND HOMELAND SECURITY

02:21:12.597 --> 02:21:14.599
PROGRAM AT LIVERMORE.

02:21:14.666 --> 02:21:15.333
I'M ALSO GRATEFUL THAT THIS IS A

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:17.101
LITTLE MORE RELAXED SETTING THAN

02:21:17.168 --> 02:21:18.970
THE PREVIOUS TIME I WAS IN FRONT

02:21:19.037 --> 02:21:20.071
OF THIS COMMITTEE WHEN I WAS ON

02:21:20.138 --> 02:21:21.573
GAS SUPERVISOR.

02:21:21.639 --> 02:21:22.874
AND THE HEAD OF THE DIVISION OF

02:21:22.941 --> 02:21:24.309
OIL AND GAS DURING A VERY

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:26.644
CHALLENGING TIME IF YOU'LL

02:21:26.711 --> 02:21:28.413
REMEMBER FEAR OF SENATOR.

02:21:28.479 --> 02:21:31.015
THE THE STATE FACES MANY

02:21:31.082 --> 02:21:32.450
CHALLENGES BUT ONE OF THE MOST

02:21:32.517 --> 02:21:37.722
SIGNIFICANT AND CHAIR LOCAL MUCH

02:21:37.789 --> 02:21:39.224
MORE RESTED FOR THE FACT THAT.

02:21:39.290 --> 02:21:41.593
I AM ACTUALLY I SLEEP AT NIGHT

02:21:41.659 --> 02:21:45.396
NOW.

02:21:45.463 --> 02:21:47.098
WE ARE TWINS WELL AND MY KIDS

02:21:47.165 --> 02:21:48.566
ARE A LITTLE OLDER SO I I'VE

02:21:48.633 --> 02:21:50.768
BEEN IN THAT SLEEPLESS STAYS.

02:21:50.835 --> 02:21:54.272
WITH BACK A FEW YEARS AGO --

02:21:54.339 --> 02:21:55.440
WELL THE CHALLENGES THE STATE

02:21:55.506 --> 02:21:56.140
FACES INSURE NICHOLS MENTIONED

02:21:56.207 --> 02:21:57.342
THIS IS THE CHALLENGE OF

02:21:57.408 --> 02:21:58.843
EMISSIONS FROM FROM --

02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:59.544
VEHICLES.

02:21:59.611 --> 02:22:01.112
IT'S A HUGE CHALLENGE AND AND

02:22:01.179 --> 02:22:02.213
ONE THAT'S NOT EASILY TACKLED.

02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:04.515
IF YOU ADD THE ENERGY.

02:22:04.582 --> 02:22:06.751
EMISSIONS FROM THE PRODUCTION OF

02:22:06.818 --> 02:22:07.785
OIL IN THE STATE AND THE

02:22:07.852 --> 02:22:10.321
REFINING OIL THE STATE. TO THE

02:22:10.388 --> 02:22:12.824
EMISSIONS OF ROUGHLY TWENTY

02:22:12.891 --> 02:22:13.524
BECAUSE IN THE STATE OF ALL

02:22:13.591 --> 02:22:15.593
TYPES --

02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:17.061
THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT HALF OF

02:22:17.128 --> 02:22:18.363
THE STATE'S EMISSIONS THAT'S

02:22:18.429 --> 02:22:19.264
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY

02:22:19.330 --> 02:22:20.331
FIVE MILLION TONS.

02:22:20.398 --> 02:22:22.934
OF CO TWO A YEAR.

02:22:23.001 --> 02:22:25.303
AND THEN DEALING WITH THAT.

02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:27.171
IS IS IS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING

02:22:27.238 --> 02:22:29.307
BECAUSE EVEN BY OPTIMISTIC.

02:22:29.374 --> 02:22:31.276
PROJECTIONS OF OF THE BUILD OUT

02:22:31.342 --> 02:22:32.543
OF THE ELECTRIC --

02:22:32.610 --> 02:22:34.812
FOR VEHICLE FLEET IN THE STATE.

02:22:34.879 --> 02:22:36.648
OIL AND AND I I A GASOLINE AND

02:22:36.714 --> 02:22:37.949
DIESEL FUEL WILL STILL BE THE

02:22:38.016 --> 02:22:39.384
PREDOMINANT FUEL --

02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:41.719
WELL INTO THE MID CENTURY --

02:22:41.786 --> 02:22:43.588
EVEN IF YOU HAVE A BATTERY --

02:22:43.655 --> 02:22:45.723
TECHNOLOGY BREAKS THROUGH --

02:22:45.790 --> 02:22:47.492
ENERGY DENSITY DOUBLES OR

02:22:47.558 --> 02:22:51.829
TRIPLES COST DECREASE --

02:22:51.896 --> 02:22:54.065
AND SAFETY IMPROVES.

02:22:54.132 --> 02:22:55.066
ITS FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE YOU CAN

02:22:55.133 --> 02:22:56.868
GET THAT INTO THE MARKET AS YOU

02:22:56.935 --> 02:22:59.170
JUST HEARD --

02:22:59.237 --> 02:23:00.705
AND THE HALF LIFE OF AUTOMOBILES

02:23:00.772 --> 02:23:01.506
IN THE STATE IS FIFTEEN YEARS

02:23:01.572 --> 02:23:03.274
ROUGHLY.

02:23:03.341 --> 02:23:05.243
SO SO THERE'S THERE'S NO SILVER

02:23:05.310 --> 02:23:06.444
BULLET HERE IN IN ADDRESSING

02:23:06.511 --> 02:23:08.379
THIS ISSUE.

02:23:08.446 --> 02:23:09.647
NOW FORTUNATELY THE STATUS HAD

02:23:09.714 --> 02:23:10.949
THE FORESIGHT TO PROVIDE

02:23:11.015 --> 02:23:12.817
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL MECHANISMS

02:23:12.884 --> 02:23:14.152
FOR INCENTIVIZING NEW APPROACHES

02:25:53.211 --> 02:25:54.712
THE STATE IS BLESSED WITH

02:25:54.779 --> 02:25:56.047
EXCELLENT GEOLOGY FOR THIS AN

02:25:56.114 --> 02:25:58.516
INITIAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT

02:25:58.583 --> 02:26:00.151
OVER TWO BILLION TONS OF CO.

02:26:00.218 --> 02:26:02.353
TWO COULD BE SEQUESTERED IN JUST

02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:04.055
THE DEPLETED OIL RESERVOIRS OF

02:26:04.122 --> 02:26:05.123
THE STATE ALONE.

02:26:05.189 --> 02:26:06.524
THERE ARE OTHER RESERVOIRS IN

02:26:06.591 --> 02:26:07.892
THE STATE THE COULD HANDLE CO

02:26:07.959 --> 02:26:10.294

02:26:10.361 --> 02:26:11.596
IS FIFTY MILLION TONS A YEAR

02:26:11.662 --> 02:26:12.997
POTENTIALLY.

02:26:13.064 --> 02:26:17.101
THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY EQUALS THE

02:26:17.168 --> 02:26:18.669
EMISSIONS THAT ARE GENERATED BY

02:26:18.736 --> 02:26:20.371

02:26:23.808 --> 02:26:24.876
SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE

02:27:26.837 --> 02:27:27.738
THERE'S HUGE POTENTIAL IN

02:27:45.823 --> 02:27:46.757
THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE

AGRICULTURAL SOILS OF CALIFORNIA

02:27:48.993 --> 02:27:50.561
ALSO HAVE PROBLEMS FOR SIMILAR

02:28:03.274 --> 02:28:05.409
THERE ARE ANOTHER OTHER EMERGING

02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:07.378

ARE ARE ARE BEING WORKED ON

02:28:56.527 --> 02:28:57.962
RIGHT NOW.

02:28:58.029 --> 02:28:59.363
ALL THESE ARE MAKING PROGRESS

02:28:59.430 --> 02:29:00.564
BUT ARE FAR FROM READY TO

02:29:00.631 --> 02:29:01.799

02:29:01.866 --> 02:29:03.901
THE STATE HAS.

02:29:03.968 --> 02:29:05.403
IN UMMARY WE SEE CCS IS A

02:29:05.469 --> 02:29:07.171
PROVEN VIABLE TECHNOLOGY TO HELP

INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION

02:29:11.509 --> 02:29:12.877

02:29:12.943 --> 02:29:14.512
THIS IS REALLY A TRANCE

02:29:14.578 --> 02:29:16.080
TRANSITIONAL TECHNOLOGY WE'RE

02:29:16.147 --> 02:29:17.848
NOT GOING TO STORE OUR WAY OUT

02:29:17.915 --> 02:29:19.483
OF THIS PROBLEM.

02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:20.318
BUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BUY

02:29:20.384 --> 02:29:21.419
TIME.

02:29:21.485 --> 02:29:22.853
AND AND TIME IS WHAT WE DON'T

02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:24.989
HAVE IF WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

02:29:25.056 --> 02:29:26.724
THIS PROBLEM AGGRESSIVELY --

02:29:26.791 --> 02:29:28.092
FROM THE EARLY NINETIES WHEN IT

02:29:28.159 --> 02:29:29.593
WAS CLEAR IT WAS A PROBLEM WE

02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:31.462
MIGHT BE IN A DIFFERENT POSITION.

02:29:31.529 --> 02:29:33.898
BUT WE NEED ALL ALL OPTIONS ON

02:29:33.964 --> 02:29:35.700
THE TABLE HOW DO YOU CAPTURE THE

02:29:35.766 --> 02:29:38.202
CARBON AS PART OF THIS.

02:29:38.269 --> 02:29:40.371
SO -- THE

02:29:40.438 --> 02:29:41.305
ACCOUNT WELL IF YOU CAN'T YOU

02:29:41.372 --> 02:29:42.440
CAN CAPTURE FROM OF THE

REFINERIES.

02:29:43.474 --> 02:29:46.110
IF YOU HURT CARBON CAPTURE AND

02:29:46.177 --> 02:29:47.745
VICES DEVICES ON THE RISE THE

02:29:47.812 --> 02:29:49.080
NICE THING ABOUT REFINERIES IS

02:29:49.146 --> 02:29:51.215
pIS THAT THE CO TWO STREAM IS

02:29:51.282 --> 02:29:53.184
RELATIVELY CLEAN --

02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:55.152
FAIR AND BUT YOU CAN CAPTURE IT

02:29:55.219 --> 02:29:56.754
DIRECTLY FROM THE AIR AS WELL IN

02:29:56.821 --> 02:29:57.688
IS AS YOU HEARD CHAIR NICHOLS

02:29:57.755 --> 02:29:59.757
THAT'S THAT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGY

02:29:59.824 --> 02:30:01.425
THAT'S QUITE READY FOR PRIME

02:30:01.492 --> 02:30:03.227
TIME IT'S MAKING GOOD PROGRESS.

02:30:03.294 --> 02:30:04.729
BUT YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:30:04.795 --> 02:30:07.098
ALSO THEN TAKE OUT CRITERIA

02:30:07.164 --> 02:30:08.599
POLLUTANTS AND OTHER TOXICS.

02:30:08.666 --> 02:30:09.567
SPECIALLY DISADVANTAGED

02:30:11.635 --> 02:30:12.470
FIELDS.

02:30:12.536 --> 02:30:14.372
AND SUCK ALL THAT STUFF OUT AND

02:30:14.438 --> 02:30:16.273
PUT IT UNDERGROUND SO THE CCO TO

02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:18.209
THE GOES UNDERGROUND DOESN'T

02:30:18.275 --> 02:30:20.511
HAVE TO BE PERFECTLY PURE.

02:30:20.578 --> 02:30:21.512

SYQUEST TO THE FOOD INDUSTRY AT

02:30:24.348 --> 02:30:26.517
A LOSS --

02:30:26.584 --> 02:30:28.452
REFINERIES DON'T SEQUESTER CO

02:30:28.519 --> 02:30:30.388
TWO RIGHT NOW THERE'S A FAIRLY

02:30:30.454 --> 02:30:31.789
SIGNIFICANT PRODUCER DO IT.

GET BACK IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

02:30:35.292 --> 02:30:37.428
GROWTH OF OR OR THE RICE

02:30:37.495 --> 02:30:40.398
PRODUCERS PUT IT IN TO FUMIGATE

02:30:40.464 --> 02:30:42.333
THEIR THEIR SILOS THINGS LIKE

RIGHT IT IS A AND THAT IS GOING

02:30:58.649 --> 02:30:59.583
TO FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE BECAUSE

02:30:59.650 --> 02:31:01.452
I MEAN CHEMISTRY IS USED IN

02:31:01.519 --> 02:31:02.953
SEPARATING THE AT THE SHE WOULD

02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:03.654
DO FROM THERE.

02:31:03.721 --> 02:31:05.356

02:35:47.571 --> 02:35:48.539
OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY NOT A HARD

02:35:48.605 --> 02:35:50.207
CAP ON MISSIONS IN TWENTY THIRTY

02:35:50.274 --> 02:35:51.475
INCREDULOUSLY DURING CARP TO

02:35:51.542 --> 02:35:52.543
CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE REST AN

02:35:52.609 --> 02:35:53.610
OVERSUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES WILL

02:35:53.677 --> 02:35:54.578
UNDERMINE THE CAP AND TRADE

02:35:54.645 --> 02:35:56.146
PROGRAMS INTENDED ROLE AS A

02:35:56.213 --> 02:35:59.983
BACKSTOP TO ME TWENTY SB THIRTY

02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:01.719
TWO LIMITS --

02:36:01.785 --> 02:36:02.519
AND THEN I WANT TO RETURN TO A

02:36:02.586 --> 02:36:03.420
POINT THAT DOCTOR BROWN MADE N

02:36:03.487 --> 02:36:04.788
HIS REMARKS REGARDING THE USE OF

02:36:04.855 --> 02:36:05.622
CARBON PRICING VERSUS

02:36:05.689 --> 02:36:06.990
COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES YOU SEE

02:36:07.057 --> 02:36:08.225
US FOR SUPPORT CURRENT PRICING

02:36:08.292 --> 02:36:09.059
IS IMPORTANT TOOL.

02:36:09.126 --> 02:36:10.160
REDUCING CRIME AT POLLUTION BUT

02:36:10.227 --> 02:36:11.328
WE BELIEVE IN EVEN MORE STRONGLY

02:36:11.395 --> 02:36:12.262
IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING

02:36:12.329 --> 02:36:13.597
CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT OTHER

02:36:13.664 --> 02:36:14.665
FOUNDATION OF POLICIES THAT

02:36:14.732 --> 02:36:15.566
REDUCE EMISSIONS FOSTER

02:36:15.632 --> 02:36:17.601
INNOVATION IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES

02:36:17.668 --> 02:36:18.168
AND PRODUCE VALUABLE COULD

02:36:18.235 --> 02:36:21.405
BENEFITS. FOR COMMITTEES ACROSS

02:36:21.472 --> 02:36:24.341
STATE THINKING.

02:36:24.408 --> 02:36:27.478
YEP YEP ALL SET THE I JUST

02:36:27.544 --> 02:36:28.612
WANTED TO GO BACK ALSO TO

02:36:28.679 --> 02:36:29.713
SOMETHING DOCTOR BROWN TALKED

02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:31.215
ABOUT THE LA OVER FOUR EIGHT

02:36:31.281 --> 02:36:32.449
KNOWLEDGE IS THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:36:32.516 --> 02:36:35.185
FEELING OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS --

02:36:35.252 --> 02:36:36.553
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE

02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:38.422
ATMOSPHERE CARES ABOUT AND RAN

02:36:38.489 --> 02:36:40.624
REALLY ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVING

02:36:40.691 --> 02:36:42.893
OUR CLIMATE AND PULLS WRIT LARGE --

02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:44.161
WE SEE BANKING ACTUALLY IS AN

02:36:44.228 --> 02:36:45.896
IMPORTANT WAY TO HELP ACHIEVE

02:36:45.963 --> 02:36:48.198
EARLY EMISSION REDUCTIONS WHICH

02:36:48.265 --> 02:36:49.533
ARE OF COURSE ESSENTIAL TO

02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:50.534
GREATER CUMULATIVE EMISSION

02:36:50.601 --> 02:36:51.835
REDUCTIONS --

02:36:51.902 --> 02:36:54.004
SO SO I THINK THAT POINT NEEDS

02:36:54.071 --> 02:36:55.539
TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT TAT

02:36:55.606 --> 02:36:57.541
BANKING DOES INCENTIVIZE THOSE

02:36:57.608 --> 02:36:59.009
REDUCTIONS AND AND THAT'S REALLY

02:36:59.076 --> 02:36:59.877
IMPORTANT.

02:36:59.943 --> 02:37:03.380
AND SO WE SEE THAT THE BANK OF

02:37:03.447 --> 02:37:06.316
ALLOWANCES.

02:37:06.383 --> 02:37:08.385
SET YOUR OF YOUR WHAT ARE

02:37:08.452 --> 02:37:10.120
DISCRIMINATION OCCURS IT BECAUSE

02:37:10.187 --> 02:37:11.321
THEY SURE I MEAN THAT CONCERN I

02:37:11.388 --> 02:37:13.657
I'M MY BEST UNDERSTANDING THEIR

02:37:13.724 --> 02:37:14.625
CONCERNS THAT.

02:37:14.691 --> 02:37:17.194
IT'S JUST BEEN A FOR YOUR FOR

02:37:17.261 --> 02:37:19.062
FOLKS.

02:37:19.129 --> 02:37:20.931
TO SORT OF BY A CREDITS INTO THE

02:37:20.998 --> 02:37:23.233
FUTURE AND AND SO.

02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:26.403
SURE SO HOW WE SEE IT IS THAT OF

02:37:26.470 --> 02:37:27.871
ALLOWANCES PURCHASE NOW AND NOT

02:37:27.938 --> 02:37:29.406
USE NOW REPRESENTS A TON OF THE

02:37:29.473 --> 02:37:30.908
MISSIONS IS NOT EMITTED NOW SO

02:37:30.974 --> 02:37:32.976
THAT IS THERE FOR LESS TIME.

02:37:33.043 --> 02:37:34.111
MEAN DECADES IN THIS CASE AT

02:37:34.178 --> 02:37:35.479
THAT TIME ISN'T DAMAGING THE

02:37:35.546 --> 02:37:37.047
ATMOSPHERE --

02:37:37.114 --> 02:37:38.248
BUT I THINK THERE'S A YOU KNOW

02:37:38.315 --> 02:37:40.250
OF THE FURTHER POINT THAT BY

02:37:40.317 --> 02:37:41.952
HAVING THIS MAN OF ALLOWANCES.

02:37:42.019 --> 02:37:43.620
OF THIS ALSO REALLY INCENTIVIZE

02:37:43.687 --> 02:37:45.522
IS CALIFORNIA TO ACTUALLY TAKES

02:37:45.589 --> 02:37:48.425
STEPS BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY OR

02:37:48.492 --> 02:37:49.159
TWENTY FIVE THIRTY AND SET

02:37:49.226 --> 02:37:51.695
TARGETS FURTHER OUT --

02:37:51.762 --> 02:37:53.297
THE BANK OF ALLOWANCES MIGHT BE

02:37:53.363 --> 02:37:54.464
A GREATER THREAT IF WE KNEW THAT

02:37:54.531 --> 02:37:55.799
CAP AND TRADE WAS GOING TO END

02:37:55.866 --> 02:37:57.901
IN -- TWENTY

02:37:57.968 --> 02:37:59.203
THIRTY BUT I DON'T THINK THAT

02:37:59.269 --> 02:37:59.770
THAT'S GOING TO YOU KNOW I'M

02:37:59.837 --> 02:38:00.871
ENOUGH OF AN OPTIMIST NOT TO

02:38:00.938 --> 02:38:01.839
BELIEVE THAT THAT'S GOING TO

02:38:01.905 --> 02:38:03.240
HAPPEN SO I THINK IF WE LOOK OUT

02:38:03.307 --> 02:38:04.508
PAST.

02:38:04.575 --> 02:38:05.342
TWENTY THIRTY THAT WOULD

02:38:05.409 --> 02:38:08.011
ELIMINATE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS --

02:38:08.078 --> 02:38:08.579
AND I THINK THE LAST POINT I

02:38:08.645 --> 02:38:11.748
WANT TO MAKE RATE IS NOT THE END

02:38:11.815 --> 02:38:13.183
ALL BE ALL TO MEETING OUR

02:38:13.250 --> 02:38:14.484

AT THAT THE STATE CAN BE DOING

02:38:16.453 --> 02:38:17.988
AN ETF IS REALLY INTERESTED IN

SCENES STATE TO MORE ON HEAVY
