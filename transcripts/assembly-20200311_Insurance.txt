SO I RESPOND ASK THAT FOR A MOMENT- TO PLEASE STEP BACK FROM LOOKING AT THE DRAFT REGULATION TAXED. AND THAT WAS PUBLISHED PUBLICLY SHARED WITH STAKEHOLDERS LAST DECEMBER. REALLY I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER THAT THE COMMISSIONER WITH THE COMMISSIONERS COMING FROM HIS CORE OBJECTIVE HERE. WHICH IS RESERVE AFFINITY GROUPS WILL MAKING SURE THAT SAFE DRIVERS. IN ALL SOCIO ECONOMIC CLASSES AND REGARDLESS OF EDUCATION LEVEL ATTAINED AN OCCUPATIONAL STATUS BENEFIT EVENLY FROM HIS AFFINITY GROUP DISCOUNTS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE MORE FOR. INSURANCE AND SO I REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO STEP BACK UP FROM THE REGULATION TAX BECAUSE IT JUST TO GO FROM A HIGH LEVEL OF WHERE. IT'S COMING. VIEW ALL OF YOU WORK. HIM IT WAS HERE IN THE STATE LET. NO HE'S COME FROM YOU KNOW THE DISTRICT THAT HE REPRESENTED IN THE ASSEMBLY AND ENDS AND- AND STATE SENATE AND SO YOU HAVE THE- BELIEVE A STRONG SENSE OF WHO HE IS AS A PERSON AND WHO HE IS AS A- AS A- FORMER LEGISLATOR IN AND- IT CONTINUED ELECTED HERE IN OUR STATE AND SO AS WE CONTINUE IN THIS HEARING AND- CALIFORNIANS. WITH COMPARABLY SAFE DRIVING RECORDS BENEFIT FAIRLY AND EQUITABLY FROM THESE INSURANCE AFFINITY GROUPS WHICH OFFER MORE AFFORDABLE CAR INSURANCE. I'D SAY BASED DOT AND I'LL HAVE MY COLLEAGUES OF WALK THROUGH THAT WITH YOU AND USE MAPS THAT THE ANSWER THUS FAR IS NO. DATA THAT THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED LAST YEAR FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES SHOWS THAT ONE'S EDUCATION ONE'S OCCUPATION AND ONCE INCOME LEVEL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN WHETHER ONE RECEIVE THE DISCOUNT. THANKS IN ADDITION I ASK THAT YOU JUST PLEASE KEEP US SOME OF THESE KEY FACTUAL CONSIDERATIONS IN MIND NAMELY. UNLIKE OTHER INSURANCE PRODUCTS CAR INSURANCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS LEGALLY REQUIRED IN CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO DRIVE A VEHICLE I KNOW WE KNOW THAT BUT IT'S JUST SORT OF THE SORT OF BASE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. OUR DEPARTMENT THAT. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIGHER PRIOR APPROVAL OF THESE CAR INSURANCE PREMIUMS IN THE STATE TO ENSURE THEY ARE FAIR AND BASED ON OBJECTIVE FACTORS THAT HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL RELATIONSHIP TO A DRIVERS RISK OF LOS. THIRDLY PROP ONE OF THREE- REQUIRES CAR INSURANCE PREMIUMS BE BASED ON THREE MANDATORY FACTORS AND ENSURE YOU'VE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF THESE AS A DRIVER SAFETY RECORD. ANNUAL MILES DRIVEN. AND YEARS OF DRIVING EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS PROHIBITS UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY OF BRICKS. FOURTHLY THE COMMISSIONER CAN THEN ADOPT OPTIONAL THE COLD OPTIONAL RATING FACTORS BY REGULATION THAT HAVE BY AND LARGE THEY HAVE A LAST AND THEY SHOULD HAVE A LAST IMPACT ON PREMIUMS IN THE THROUGH THE AFFIRMATION MANAGER AFTER IS THAT STATE. YET IS OFF TRACK CANNOT BE USED AND IT IS COMMITTEE WAY AGAIN CAD DRIVERS WITH UNPAYABLE RISK LAW. FOR THESE EIGHT. THE RECORD SO. YOU WHAT THE SAME TWO DIFFERENT DRIVE. EVERYTHING IN A- THE THREE MANDATORY FOR. PLAY INTO WHAT IT PAY AGAIN THE SAFETY RECORD THEIR ANNUAL MILES DRIVEN. AND THEIR YEARS OF DRIVING EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER SUPPORT THAT EDUCATION LEVEL TAMED. AND OCCUPATIONAL STATUS HAVE NEVER BEEN ADOPTED BY THE DEPARTMENT AS OPTIONAL RATING FACTORS. FIFTY PROP ONE OF THREE PERMITS GROUPS TO EXIST OKAY AND THE GOAL OF DEPARTMENT IS TO ENSURE THAT SUCH A GROUP DISCOUNTS ARE DISTRIBUTED AMONG ALL THOSE. SURE IT'S RICK OF THEIR OR OCCUPATION AND THAT'S KEY AGAIN AND MY COLLEAGUES A BRIGHT WILL WALK THROUGH JUST SORT OF THAT THAT THERE ARE SOME. AS FOR A POP THIS IS IMPORTANT DISTINCTION. FORTY FOUR NHÃ  A AND HEALTH FOR THE WE'VE GONE REGARD TO PUBLIC IN PER ALL THE OF HEALTH RESIDENTS CALIFORNIA ALREADY AND THE USE GENDER. CREDIT SCORE PRIOR. PRIOR COVERAGE LIMITS AND UNINSURED STATUS IN THE CALCULATION OF A DRIVER'S AUTO INSURANCE PREMIUMS TODAY AN OPTIONAL RATING FACTORS AND THOSE ARE IMPORTANT TO KNOW BECAUSE IT'S JUST HELP. AS POLICY IS DECIDED THAT THOSE TWO SIX OF A DRIVER SHOULD NOT INSURANCE COMPANY IN ORDER. ON THE PREMIUM THE FIFTH TODAY. COUPLE SINGLE PASSOVER BRIAN. PLEASE KNOW THAT THERE ARE THREE TODAY MICHIGAN MASS. AND VERMONT BANNED THE USE OF OCCUPATION EDUCATION AS RATING FACTORS FOR CAR INSURANCE TODAY AND SO THERE ARE THREE STATES ALREADY IN IN THE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT BAND RIGHT THE USE OF EDUCATION ATTAINMENT AN OCCUPATION. THE CARD IS TODAY. THE STATE OF NEW. I'M ALSO PROHIBITS THE USE OF OCCUPATION ARE EDUCATION AND LESS THE INSURER DEMONSTRATES THESE DOCTORS ARE TRULY PROTECT PREDICTIVE OF NOT JUST THE CORRELATION BUT COSTLY. IT IS SIX. IT WILL NOW PASSED FOR TO MISTER HENLEY TO A TO- PROVIDE YOU KNOW OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE AND ITS OBJECTIVES. THANK YOU MISTER MARTINEZ AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING. AGAIN MY NAME IS BRIAN KENLEY I'M DEPUTY CURRENT SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA. INDO JUST TO TAKE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BACK TO TWENTY NINETEEN IT LIKE TO GIVE A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE ON HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. COMMISSIONER LARA BEING A NEW INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IN TWENTY NINETEEN HAD BEFORE HE EVEN TOOK OFFICE COULD BEEN AWARE OF THE CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN RAISED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW ABOUT. WHETHER AUTO INSURANCE RATES. SIR SENSE OF SUS THESE OF CALIFORNIA'S DRIVERS SPECIFICALLY THERE HAD BEEN CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THE USE OF AFFINITY GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHETHER THOSE AFFINITY GROUPS. ARE SOCIO ECONOMICALLY BALANCED TO ALL SAFE DRIVERS WHETHER THEY ARE RICH OR POOR WHETHER THEY HAVE A LOT OF EDUCATION OR LITTLE EDUCATION. HELP BALANCE ARE THOSE GROUPS SO THERE WERE A LOT OF RUMORS A LOT OF CHATTER FOR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA TOOK OFFICE. WHEN HE GOT TO OFFICE OF COURSE AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE THERE WERE MANY WHO WERE EAGER TO HAVE THE COMMISSIONER STOP. THE TWO GROUPS RIGHT OUT THE GATE. LOW OR THEY SHOULD EXIST COMMISSIONER LOT OF BEING VERY MINDFUL AND METHODICAL AND- PLAYED ABOUT HIS. THAT'S NOT THAT'S- INTENDED I WANT TO GET THE FACTS I WENT IN FIRST WHAT THE INFORMATION IS WHERE TO THE FACTS LEAD US. AND THEN DECIDE UPON BEST STEPS BASED UPON THOSE FACTS AND SURE ENOUGH THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE COMMISSIONER DID. IN MAY OF TWENTY NINETEEN INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA INVITED THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE DATA TO THE COMPUTER SCHEDULING A SEPTEMBER. INVESTIGATORY HEARING WHERE WE WOULD REVIEW THAT DID. NOT COMMISSIONER LARA WAS VERY. INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THIS WAS A VOLUNTARY REQUEST FOR DATA IT WAS NOT A MANDATORY LINE HERE LIES THE IMPORT OF THAT. AND SO WE HAVE NOT A HUNDRED REPRESENTATION FROM THE INDUSTRY BUT WE HAD A VERY LARGE MARGIN OF THE INDUSTRY THAT VOLUNTARILY SHARE DATA. SO I WAS A PRETTY OF THE COMMITTEES. PAPER WHICH- WAS WAS VERY UP NICK WENT THROUGH A LOT OF DETAILS ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND INCLUDING THE FACT THAT. BASED UPON THE COMMITTEES BACKGROUND PAPER DATA COLLECTED WHICH WAS MORE THAN SIXTEEN MILLION VEHICLES DRIVING IN THIS STATE OR MORE THAN SIXTY PER. OF THE ENTIRE INSURANCE MARKETS. ALL OF WHOM ARE IF THE GROUP INSURANCE. FOR A FIFTH. TO SMOTHER COST. AND AS- PAPER OKAY GUYS THAT THIS DAY COLLECTED IS. STILL ADEQUATE DRAW A GENERAL GENERALIZE CONCLUSIONS AND OF COURSE. IN MISS COMMISSION RICARDO LARA AGREES. SINCE IN EIGHTY EIGHT IF YOU'RE SINGLE NOTE THIS IS THE FOR TIME IN TRANSCRIPT OR HAS. STE AFFINITY GROUPS STUDY THE IMPACT OF AFFINITY GROUPS DESPITE THE FACT THAT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THERE HAS BEEN A RISING CONCERN. ABOUT THE IMPACT OF AFFINITY GROUPS ON DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF DRIVERS IN CALIFORNIA. USE ME SIR MISTER COOLEY HAS A QUESTION. IT'S ACTUALLY MORE OF AN OBSERVATION- EARLIER TODAY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS CANCELED ERRORS ON A MEETING THEY DID CORONAVIRUS. PRIOR COMMISSIONERS IN CALIFORNIA AT THE END A I SEE HAVE PROMOTED THESE SORTS OF AFFILIATED GROUPS. PRECISELY BECAUSE BOB HUNTER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN HIS BIG STUDY OF TO THE OFOUR INSURANCE HE SAYS WE HAVE THE STATE OF THE ART SYSTEM IN THIS NATION. VANITY GROUPS. DISABILITY NEGOTIATED IS A GREAT ADVANTAGE AND I SHOULDN'T SAY THE GOSHEN BECAUSE TO GO SHE IT'S NOT IN PROP ONE OF YOUR COURSES AS AN INSURER MAY ISSUE ANY COVERAGE. TO A GROUP AND IT'S NOT UNFAIRLY TO RETORT SO YOU'RE SAYING NO OTHER COMMERCIALS LOOKED AT IT BUT IN FACT CALIFORNIA REGULARS HAVE BEEN GOING TO ANY I SEE. SO THERE SHE HAS DONE STUDIES. IN A SHE IS ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO COPY. CALIFORNIA STATE THE STATE STATE OF THE ART. SO TO SAY THAT HASN'T BEEN LOOKED AT. TO THE CONTRARY IT HAS BEEN PROMOTED. AS ONE OF THE GREAT INNOVATIONS THAT PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION PROPER THREE THESE GROUPS COULD NOT BE FORMED. RESERVATION TO FORM THEM WAS NOT BEEN PROP ONE OH THREE. CAN POINT AT THIS. DRIVE THANK. DO FUNDED PURPOSE OF PROP ONE OF THREE WHICH PROMOTE COMPETITION INSURANCE MARKET PLACE. AND THE RECORD THAT BOB HUNTER TOUTS THAT HAS BEEN TOUTED THE ANY I SEE IS INDEED COMPETENT AS ENSUED AROUND THESE IDEAS AND IS A NERD TO THE BENEFIT OF CONSUMERS AND AFFORDABILITY SO I THINK THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DOES. BUT ACT I. MEASURES LOOKED AT THIS AND THEY BEEN PROMOTING AROUND THE NATION AND THAT IS IN THE RECORD BOB HUNTER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT REPORT THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS AND WE MEMBER COOLEY AND- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY I APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE I THINK THERE ARE A FEW. POINTS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY. THE DATA THAT WAS COLLECTED HERE IS ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S SPECIFIC DRIVERS AND PARK COMMISSIONER IS NOT GOING TO BE LIKE PRIOR COMMISSIONERS TO STATE WHETHER AFFINITY GROUPS ARE GOOD OR BAD WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE FACTS THE FIRST WE DIRECTED. THE AND IT OR WHAT WE LOOK TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THOSE FACTS GO IN SO WHAT WE FOUND IN THE DATA WE COLLECTED OVER SIXTY MILLION. 60% OF THE CUP. WE'RE REAL TWENTY FIVE OR SO. WE FOR THAT THEY PREDOMINATELY FAVOR PROFESSIONAL OCCUPATIONS UPPER EDUCATION LEVELS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER SAFE DRIVING GROUPS FOR LOW INCOME LESS EDUCATED DRIVERS BUT NONE THE LESS SAFE DRIVERS. THE IN THIS THE DATA TALKING NOT OUR COMMISSIONER NOT PRIOR COMMISSIONERS NOT MISTER HUNTER THIS IS THE DATA FOR CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY NINETEEN COLLECTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN SHOWS THAT DRIVERS AN AFFINITY GROUPS ARE MORE LIKELY TO RESULT TIP CODE WITH A PREDOMINANTLY NON. ELECTION ADD A SH QUARTER OF PAPERS RESIDE SIR COMMUNITIES WE OUR STATE OR NOT IN AN AFFINITY WHILE THE REST OF THE STATE HAS UPWARDS OF 57% OF DRIVERS ARE IN AN AFFINITY GROUP THE DATA SHOWS THAT DRIVERS AFFINITY GROUPS ARE MORE LIKELY TO RESIDE IN ZIP CODE BUT HAVE A HIGHER AVERAGE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT ONLY THOSE 20% OF THOSE LIVING WITH THE LOWEST NUMBER OF COLLEGE TO. IN THE CODES ONLY TO. DISCOUNTS COMPARE THAT TO RESTRICTIONS WITHIN ZIP CODES THAT ARE 56% WERE HALF OR MORE OF THOSE DRIVERS HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES SO PEOPLE WERE HALF OR MORE PEOPLE IN THE ZIP CODE HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES 50% THOSE DRIVERS GET DISCOUNTS COMPARE DON'T HAVE DEGREES. BECAUSE AUTO INSURANCE IS A ZERO SUM SYSTEM THE WAY IT WORKS IS AN INSURER COLLECTS PREMIUM AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE IT PROVIDES A DISCOUNT TO IT MUST COUNTERBALANCE THOSE DISCOUNTS WITH SURCHARGES TO OTHER DRIVERS AND THAT'S WHAT IS MEANT BY A ZERO SUM STUFF SOME OF CALLED IT IN THE WAY OF SQUEEZING A BALLOON WHERE IF YOU HAVE A SQUEEZE ON ONE AND- IT MUST FLOW TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BLUE AND IT'S THE SAME. SYSTEM OF MONEY IT HAS BALANCE OUT THAT'S THE SOME NATURE WE FIND BASED UPON OUR STUDY THAT DRIVERS WHO RECEIVE. DIRECTOR AND YET WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T FIND AFFINITY GROUPS FOR DRIVERS LIKE A FACTORY WORKER THAT BALANCE OUT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IT IS FOLKS WHO ARE FACTORY WORKERS THOSE WERE NOT DESIGNATED INFINITY GROUP THAT PAY FOR THE DRUG THE DRIVERS THEY GET THOSE DISCOUNTS SUCH AS IT GIVES. WHAT WE- TOUCH WHICH IS A TWO TIER SYSTEM WHERE THOSE WHO MAKE LESS GET CHARGE HIGHER RATES SO THAT THE CURRENT AFFINITY GROUP SYSTEM BECOMES A PROXY FOR ONE'S INCOME THAT REWARDS CUSTOMERS WHO WILL PURCHASE OTHER PRODUCTS FROM THE INSURER. THUS PROVIDING A LARGER POTENTIAL REVENUE STREAM TO THE INSURER AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT JUST LAST WEEK CONGRESS HELD A HEARING ON MARCH FOURTH. THE HEARING WAS FROM THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES SUBCOMMITTEE ON HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND INSURANCE. THE TITLE OF THAT HERE WAS DRIVERS DISCRIMINATION AND EXAMINATION OF UNFAIR PREMIUMS PRACTICES AND POLICIES IN THE AUTO INSURANCE INDUSTRY. IT WAS FASCINATING TO READ THE TEST. ONE INSURANCE CHIEF OP. SIR THIS THE CHEN BY THE OF POPE HE'S OPERATE OFFICE OF BOTTOM INSURANCE COME. YOU KNOW AUTO INSURANCE DEBATE IN NEW JERSEY. HE TESTIFY IN PART AS FALL. QUOTE HI INCOME. OFFER A LARGER REVENUE STREAM TO AUTO INSURERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE OTHER PRODUCTS FROM MULTI LINE INSURANCE CARRIERS. A COMPANY IS HAPPY TO OFFER LOWER AUTO INSURANCE PREMIUMS WHEN THE CONSUMER IS ALSO PURCHASING SEVERAL OTHER PRODUCTS THAT MAKE. ALL ASSET PACKAGE FIVE ATTRACTIVE TO THE COMPANY HERE IS AN EXECUTIVE OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY RECOGNIZING THAT INDEED INSURERS HAVE AN INTEREST IN SELLING PRODUCTS TO THOSE WILL PURCHASE MORE PRODUCTS. NATURALLY THOSE WITH LESS MONEY WHO HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BUYING INSURANCE WHICH IS REQUIRED BY LAW AND BUYING OTHER PRODUCTS THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE FEWER OPPORTUNITIES TO PURCHASE OTHER COVERAGES AND STIR PO OF CURE AUTUMN. THIS COMPANY RECOGNIZE THIS CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY CONGRESS WAS VERY SIR OUT WHETHER STATES UP EARLY REGULATING IN THIS SPACE HELLO. THE CAN. IT BY MID MANY THE TESTIFIED BEFORE THE FOR THESE REASONS. SO I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT A FEW EXAMPLES OF SOME SURPRISING OVERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN THE FILINGS THAT WE RECEIVED TODAY FROM INSURERS THAT AFFINITY GROUPS. WE HAVE GROUPS THAT ARE PREDOMINANTLY BASED ON FUND GROUPS LIKE ENGINEERS. DOCTORS LAWYERS FRATERNITY. STE PRETTIES THERE IS A GROUP WANT ONE GROUP THAT IS CALLED QUOTE WHITE COLLAR CONTRACTOR DEVELOPER INSPECTOR THESE ARE A FEW REAL EXAMPLES OF THE PREDOMINANT TYPES OF GROUPS WE SEE INSURER FILINGS. WHAT WE SEE IS. THAT ART INVESTMENT BANKERS LAWYERS CORPORATE EXECUTIVES FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES EXPLOSIVE NOTICEABLY ABSENT GROUPS FROM THE DEPARTMENTS PER VIEW OF FILINGS. ESCAPE WORKERS ARE NOT BE FOUND SEEN PROCESS NOPE- WITHIN THESE FILINGS DAYCARE WORKERS NOT ON. FILING FIRST. RICHARD ACTOR REPORTERS HOUSEKEEPER AB FROM THE AFFINITY ON BUT I'D LIKE TO DO IS IT YOU ASSEMBLY HAS A AS ZIP THAT SHOWS VERY THEIR DISTRICT I SHOULD FOR MAPS FOR YOUR DISTRICTS THESE SHOWS SIP CODE THAT MAY HAVE SOME OVERLAP WITH A- HISTORY. WE LIKE TO YOUR FOCUSED IN ON YOUR SPECIFIC. WHENEVER DISTRICTS THAT'S FOR YOUR INFORMATION I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT THE CITY WIDE MAPS WHICH FOR THE FIRST THREE PAGES YOU HAVE. SO THE FIRST ONE I'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT IS THE LOS ANGELES AREA. AND THIS. WAS YOU HAVE EIGHT ALLEGING HERE ON THE SIDE WHERE IT HAS AN AFFINITY PERCENTAGE FROM ZERO TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. AND YOU MAKE THIS CLEAR. THIS IS BASED ON THE OTHER WE COLLECTED THE INVESTIGATORY HEARING LAST. AND IT THE REDDER THE ZIP CODE THE LESS LIKELY IT IS THAT THAT ZIP CODE HAS. PEOPLE IN THAT ZIP CODE THAT ARE GETTING AN AFFINITY GROUP DISCOUNT. CONVERSELY THE GREENER A ZIP CODE IS THE MORE PREDOMINANT IS THAT DRIVERS WITHIN THAT ZIP CODE A RECEIVING A DISCOUNT. AND SO LOOKING AT THE LOS ANGELES AREA THE ONE WHO'S FROM. LOS ANGELES SEE. A SOMEWHAT THIS TREND IN TERMS OF. REGIONALLY WHERE YOU SEE RED AND REGIONALLY WHERE YOU SEE GREEN. WAVE IT SAM. WE USED PER CAPITA INCOME HERE IN OUR COLLECTION. YOU CAN SEE THAT L. AIR. UNDER NINTH. OR CAP. FOR THAT ZIP CODE THERE IS FIFTY ONE. OF THE DRY. CODE THE VEHICLE STUDY. GET IN A- THIS. WHERE THE CAPITA INCOME WAS JUST TWELVE AND WHERE YOU SEE. PATIENT A TWELVE PER. THE SAME PATTERN AS SHOWN ON IN A CITIES. IF YOU LOOK IT'S FRANCISCO FORTY. LOOKING AT NOR BEACH THE INCOME PER CAPITA BASED ON THE DATA WE COLLECTED OVER SIXTEEN MILLION VK IT'S A HUNDRED AND NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. COME IN THE NORTH AREA HAS 75% GROUP PARTICIPATE. COMPARE THAT OAKLAND WHERE PER CAPITA INCOME IS SIXTEEN THOUSAND. GROUP PARTICIPATION AT 29% AGAIN LOOKING THESE GYMS YOU. BRENT ARTIST. THIS ANY EIGHT FINAL CAR ROLLED WITH A PER CAPITA INCOME OF SEVEN THOUSAND HAS A GROUP PARTICIPATION RATE OF 68% THAT WITH WILL BE HIGH IN INCOME PER CAPITA OF TWENTY THOUSAND WORDS. WE I'D SAY THAT JUST. AT THESE PAD EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEY EXIST WITHIN YOUR OWN MEMBERSHIPS DISTRICTS. SO THAT THE COMMISSIONER HAS MADE IT CLEAR BASED UPON THE STUDY THERE IS ONE CLEAR UNDENIABLE FACT TODAY. BASED ON THE DATA WE DID MORE THAN 60% OF THE MARKET MORE THAN SIXTEEN MILLION VEHICLES IN THE STATE. MORE FLUENT EDUCATED DROP RECEIVE MORE GROUP DISCOUNTS BEEN LESS WEALTHY LESS FORMALLY EDUCATED IF DRIVERS. IN SH HAVE YET PROVIDE US WITH DATA TO SHOW WHY POUR LES FORMALLY EDUCATED DRIVERS NOT RECEIVE THE SAME. SORT OF THE SAME OUT AS WITH WHO ARE WEALTHY WHICH RIGHT PRESENT. WITH THE- THREE MISTER GRAYSON GO HEADS YOUR MISTER CHAIR ADD TO AS AN I HAVE THE PRESENT COMING FOR I JUST NEED SOME CLARIFICATION ON- HOW COME ABOUT WITH THE INCOME PER CAPITA MY DISTRICT. ARE YOU HAVE AN INCOME CAPITA TWENTY TWO THOUSAND HOWEVER. THAT'S NOT THE FIGURES THAT I WOULD HAVE AS FAR AS- INCOME IN MY AREA AS FAR AS AN AVERAGE INCOME SO. CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW YOU CAME FOR THESE TWO YEARS ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON A COUPLE OF POINTS SO THAT THE FIGURES COME FROM. CENSUS DATA. THERE IS A COMPANY AS REPEAT DEMO. THAT US INSISTS. FOR PER CAP INCOME FOR ZIP CODES THAT'S THE DATA SOURCE. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE WHAT PER CAPITA INCOME GAINS HEARING BECAUSE IS AN IMPORTANT TIME TO DO THAT. PER CAPITA INCOME IS NOT THE SAME THING AS AVERAGE SALARIES SO. WHAT PER CAPITA INCOME MEANS LET ME JUST TAKE AN EXAMPLE OF A FAMILY OF FOUR. YOU HAVE LET'S SAY A HUSBAND AT. A SPOUSE TO CHILDREN. BUT IN THE HOUSE TURN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND OF COURSE THE CHILDREN HAVE NO INCOME SO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THAT FAMILY OF FOUR YOU TAKE THE TWO HUNDRED DIVIDED BY FOUR. AND THE PER CAPITA INCOME OF THAT HOUSEHOLD IS FIFTY THOUSAND. TWO I DO BESIDES THAT WHEN YOU SEE A FIGURE LIKE LIKE A TWELVE THOUSAND THAT MAY NOT BE THE SALARIES OF THE PEOPLE DISTRICT. IT'S ON A PER CAPITA. SO IF. TO DO AVERAGE. INCOME FOR THE HOUSEHOLD WITH THAT CHANGE THIS AT. THE GLEE. RATHER BUT A I'M JUST ASKING POLICE SUBMIT TO YOU THAT WHEN WHETHER YOU LOOK AT THIS ON A PER CAPITA BASIS OR JUST AN INCOME EARNER BASIS THE TRAINS WILL REMAIN THE SAME. IF YOU LOOK AT THE REGIONS OF THE CITIES WHERE YOU SEE. ALL THESE HOW THESE. ARE GETTING MORE AND LESS AFFINITY GROUPS. THAT'S GOING TO EXIST THESE ARE THE DROP IN THESE CATIONS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU SUGGEST THEY WERE GONNA REMAIN THE SAME IS A REASON WHY WE DIDN'T USE INCOME BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE WOULD RELATE TO INCOME MORE THAN THEY WOULD PER CAPITA. AND IT'S A FAIR POINT ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THE RESOURCES WE HAD US CENSUS DATA AND AS RE DEMOGRAPHICS DATA WERE THE BEST TOOLS WE HAD TO USE BASED UPON THE STUDY. IT EITHER CONCERT OTHER WAYS TO SHOW THE SAME IMPACT. THANK YOU. MISTER COOPER. TO QUESTION SO OBVIOUSLY YOU WANNA DO IT DISCOUNTS FOR THE STUDY GROUPS. BUT WILL STILL BE OTHER DISCOUNTS IN THE INSURANCE ARENA FOR OTHER THINGS CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT AND THEN ON THE AS FAR AS CLAIMS GOOD. THE TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS YOU'RE MISSING HERE. FOR THE CLAIMS OF TO HIRE. LOWER GROUPING BUT SINCE. WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT YES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND- AND I SHOULD EMPHASIZE WHAT ARE DATA DOES NOT SHE DOES NOT STUDY WE DO NOT WE DID NOT STUDY CLAIMS DATA. BASED UPON THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVE WE STUDY JUST. ZIP CODE LEVEL. VEHICLES WHO GETS GROUPS WHO DOES NOT A QUESTION WE CONTINUE TO ASK INSURERS AND AGAIN WOULD VAST. WE HELD A WORKSHOP IN INVESTIGATORY HERE IN SEPTEMBER. A WORKSHOP IN JANUARY WE HAVE URGED INSURERS TO PRESENT DATA TO EXPLAIN TO US. IF POOR DRIVERS BECAUSE POOR DRIVERS LESS EDUCATED DRIVERS ARE REPRESENTED HERE. WHY WHY IS THAT WE'VE NOT RECEIVED AN ANSWER TO THAT DATA TO DEMONSTRATE THAT OR- ARE LESS EDUCATED DRIVERS ARE RISKIER DRIVERS. WE JUST HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE DATA. THE FOLKS TALKS ABOUT UNINSURED LAW OF PEOPLE NEED TO CARRY MORE UNINSURED MOTORISTS INSURANCE THESE DAYS RICHARD MOTORS THAT'S A BIG ISSUE. IS DOES THAT FACTOR THAT I MEAN THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER. MOVING PARTS TO THIS SO I'M TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IT I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMMON ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER IT THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS TO THIS BUT I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU. THAT FOR THOSE DRIVERS WHO ARE. JUST GETTING BY BUT PURCHASING INSURANCE WHICH IS REQUIRED BY LAW. IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING DISCOUNTS THAT IS NOT HELPING AN UNINSURED MOTORIST ISSUE IT IS MAKING IT WORSE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE CHOOSING WHETHER TO BUY GROCERIES THAT WEEK OR PAYS THEIR THEIR PAYMENT PLAN FOR PREMIUM. SO TO THE EXTENT THESE DRIVERS ARE SAFE DRIVERS AND NOT RECEIVING THE DISCOUNTS WE ARE DOING A DISSERVICE TO CALIFORNIANS WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND THE COMMISSION IS CONCERNED. THANK MR MAY SAYS GO DO YOU WANT TO CALL JUST BECAUSE I'VE GOT THE MAP OF MY DISTRICT IN- DISTRICT FORTY TWO AND DAMS THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT TO READ HERE EXCEPT FOR- THERE'S A LITTLE GREEN HOW CALLED AN OLIVE- ON THE NORTH SIDE OF SAM YOU KNOW COUNTY MY GUESS IS- THAT'S TWO TWENTY POUNDS WRINKLE INQUIRER GROUND COMBAT CENTER AND MY GUESS IS THAT MIDDLE THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE IN THE MILITARY- ARE- PERCENT A PRETTY CLOSE TO IT. IS THAT ACCURATE. ALL OF YOUR IS THERE ASSEMBLYMEMBER MAYES THAT THAT IS TWENTY NINE PALMS THE GREEN AREA YOU SEE AND THE REASON WE DIDN'T HIGHLIGHT THAT AREA IS WE WERE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WHERE WE SHOULD HIGHLIGHTED THESE BALLOONS THAT WE HAD A STATE CREDIBLE AMOUNT OF DRIVERS WITHIN THAT ZIP CODE AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IF YOU JUST HAD TEN DRIVERS AND IS IT CODE. NOT A VERY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT SAMPLE- SO WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT ZIP CODES THAT HAD AT LEAST A THOUSAND VEHICLES A THOUSAND AND EIGHTY TO BE PRECISE WAS DETERMINED AS THE RIVER ABILITY SO THAT'S WHAT HIGHLIGHT COMES BUT TO SET THIS SUMMER MAYES UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM. HELLO TERRY MEMBERS DO BENEFIT FROM A GROUP OUT UNDER THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT ARE NOW DRAFT WORKS SET MILITARY MEN WOULD CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THOSE LONG AS THEY AT A LOWER RISK ACCESS. WE'VE DONE THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS THOUGH IN YOUR- TESTIMONY THAT YOU'RE MAKING THE CASE. ALMOST AS IF. THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM POOR PEOPLE- BUT I DIDN'T QUITE HEAR THAT DIRECTLY- ARE ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T WANT POOR PEOPLE TO BE TO JOIN AFFINITY GROUPS- AND IF. THAT IF THAT'S THE CASE WHAT WE DO TO RESOLVE THAT THAT'S- I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION ASSEMBLY. TO BE CLEAR ON. WE ARE NOT. CERTAIN THAT INSURERS ARE INTO ITALY DISCRIMINATING AGAINST DRIVERS. BUT WHAT I THINK IS TELL IS THAT THAT THE TESTIMONY I READ TO YOU FROM WANTING FOR COMPANY IT'S- TENDS TO DISCRIMINATE. IS IN IT TO MAKE MONEY I MEAN IF I WERE AN INSURER AND I DIDN'T CARE TO MAKE MONEY I WOULDN'T BE IN INTERPHALANGAL. AND AS WE'VE HEARD FROM TESTIMONY. FROM THIS INSURANCE COMPANY CALLED CURE. HIGHER INCOME DRIVERS OFFER A LARGER REVENUE STREAM. SO THERE IS A PRE ELECTION A PREFERENCE FOR HIGHER DRIVERS THAT MAY BY MORE PER. IT'S THAT THAT IS A BETTER PROFITABLE INVESTMENT FROM INSURERS PERSPECTIVE AND PROBABLY THERE IS LESS ENERGY FOCUSED ON POOR DRIVERS THAT ARE AS LIKELY TO PERCH MULTIPLE PRODUCTS. IT'S AN INTENT TO DISCRIMINATE IT'S AN INTO SERB TO MAKE MONEY. AND MR CHARSADDA TWO QUESTIONS IF YOU WATCH ME TO ASK IF THE THIRD- HOW. IS IT TO JOIN. NITTY GROUP I UNDERSTAND THAT A IS A IS AN AFFINITY. IS THAT ACCURATE HOW AND I. THE MISSION. YOUR YOUR- HOW HARD IS IT TO JOIN RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES IT DEPENDS UPON WHO YOU ARE HOW ARE IT IS TO JOIN IT'S FASCINATING BUT THE BUT THE STATUS THE DATA THAT WE'VE COLLECTED WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS PREDOMINATELY FOR THOSE WHO ARE WEALTHIER OR MORE EDUCATED THERE ARE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO END THAT FITS YOU FOR THE DRIVERS OF OUR STATE THERE ARE FEWER OPPORTUNITIES TO BETTER FIND A GROUP THEY THEY DO IT FROM THE TIME FOR EXAMPLE ONE ESTIMATE DETAIL. BURNED NURSE IS COSTCO MEMBERSHIP UNLIKE A LOT OF THE GROUPS WE SEE TODAY COSTCO MEMBERS WERE ESSENTIALLY LEVEL ACROSS ALL THE ZIP CODE GROUPS WHETHER IT WAS THE POOREST DRIVERS OR THE RICHEST DRIVERS COUPLE MEMBERSHIP AMONG THEM. BOTH HAD A CAUGHT MESS DISK. WERE OF ALL STRESS OBSESS. THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM GROUPS LIKE LAWYERS DOCTORS ENGINEERS WORK AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE IS A VERY SKEWED SEGMENT OF SOCIETY THE BENEFITS FROM THOSE AN OVERALL OUR DATA SHOWS. THAT THE TREND IS TOWARD RICHER MORE EDUCATE FIBERS ARE EXCEPTIONS. IT OF WHAT WHAT LIKE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MISTER CHAIR DALY AYE I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT BACK OVER TO MISTER MARTINEZ IT AT THE PROPER TIME BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE MORE QUESTIONS. HE I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM QUITE A FEW COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER GIBSON WHAT WAS NEXT IN YEAH GO AHEAD SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- I WAS GOING TO ASK IF WE CAN FINISH THE PRESENTATION AND ASK QUESTIONS BUT SINCE. THAT YOUR FAULT WHAT KEY IS TALK ABOUT THE MARKETING PIECE TO AREAS THAT ARE THAT ARE FACT NOT RECEIVING. FINISH GROUP OF DISCOUNTS THEN IF IT'S- IS YEAH ONCE TALK ABOUT THAT THAT I WANT TO ASK MY NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT OTHER STATES DOING. TO HAVE THIS AT THIS ISSUE. IF YOU WANT GET. THE MORE. TO SPEAK TO THAT FOR THE WAY YOU KNOW THIS IS THERE ARE EIGHT YOU I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM INSURERS WHO CAN SPEAK TO WALK BY AND HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS BUT IN COMMENTS WE RECEIVE PEAKING WITH COPIES AS WE'VE MET WITH MANY COMPANIES AND INSURERS AND CONSUMER GROUPS. THEY TELL US IS THAT THERE ARE BENEFITS TO HAVING A MARKET EXCLUSIVE MARKETING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN INSURER IN A PARTICULAR GROUP I'M NOT GONNA NAME ANY PARTICULAR INSURER OR ANY PARTICULAR GROUP BUT CAN JUST GEN A GROUP OF AN ASIAN. THAT MIGHT HAVE TO FIT WITH THE COME BY HAVING ANY ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY THE GROUP PEOPLE GET DISCOUNT ANY TURNED GET A LIVE OF ALL OF NUMBER SHIP THAT THEY FOR OTHER MARKETING SO. THIS IS THROUGH THE DISCIPLINE GET. YOU SEE THIS THIS TYPE RELATIONSHIP ISN'T ABOUT SAFE DRIVING WERE RISKY DRIVING THIS TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP IS A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP AND IT'S ABOUT IT'S ABOUT INFORMATION. SO FROM A MARKETING PERSPECTIVE THAT IS CERTAINLY AN ELEMENT OF HOUSE SOME AFFINITY GROUPS ARE ESTABLISHED THAT THE INSURER IN THE ORGANIZATION SEE A MUTUALLY FINANCIALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP TO ESTABLISHING OR PERFORM THAT GROUP. AND I'VE ALREADY LOST THE SICK PART OF YOUR QUESTION WHERE WERE THE OTHER STATES DOING THANK YOU TO ADDRESS THIS YES SO OTHER STATES THIS IS THIS IS ALSO A FASCINATING SUBJECT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. AS NOT TO DIGRESS TO BUT JUST LIKE WHEN YOU A REAL OF SCHOOL FOR AUTO INSURANCE. THE STATE HAVE ALLOWED AT SCHOOL. AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS A FASCINATING TREND IN RECENT YEARS BOTH REFER TO REGARD THE CREDIT SCORE AND ALSO WITH REGARD TO AFFINITY GROUPS AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. IS WHAT WE TALK ABOUT CREDIT SCORE MANY STATES HAVE NOW BEEN A BUYER'S REMORSE. THEY REGRET EVER ALLOWING CREDIT SCORE INTO THEIR MARKETS WHY BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN THE SOCIOECONOMIC DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT ON THEIR STATE. THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE SEEN THE SAME THING WITH AFFINITY GROUPS THE RATIONAL HEARING THAT REFERENCE EARLIER TODAY THAT JUST HAPPENED LAST WEEK IT IS EXACTLY UP. H. BUT- OF THE ACTUAL. IT WAS DRIVERS OF DISCRIMINATION AND EXAMINATION OF UNFAIR PREMIUMS PRACTICES AND POLICIES IN THE AUTO INSURANCE INDUSTRY. SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STATES IN VERY RECENT YEARS JUST LAST YEAR MICHIGAN PASSED SB ONE THAT'S JUST THAT'S A THAT'S THE STATE. NOW HAS A LAW THAT BANS USE OF EDUCATION OCCUPATION AND GENDER AMONG OTHER THINGS WHEN RATING FOR INSURANCE THAT LAW WILL TAKE EFFECT IN JULY. VERMONT IS THAT THAT THAT WOULD PUSH AGAIN MICHIGAN OF VERMONT IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE BILL ONE. YEAH YEAH YES FOR MICHIGAN THAT WAS SENATE ONE IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT PASSED IT WILL TAKE AFFECTING A LOT. HERE VERMONT IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A STATE THAT SAW HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN LOWER HOUSEHOLD INCOMES AND HIGHER RATING FACTORS AND NAY BANDIT AND SAID THIS IS AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY GETS UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY FROM WHAT THE- MASSACHUSETTS. SIMILARLY BANS THE USE OF EDUCATION AND OCCUPATION. NEW YORK ADOPTED A REGULATION AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT SAYS. YOU KNOW SHOW US THE DATA WE WILL ALLOW AFFINITY GROUPS YOU CAN SHOW US THAT YOU'RE NOT DISCRIMINATORY THAT THERE IS A TRUE RELATION TO RISK OF LOSS. BUT UNTIL YOU DO THAT YOU CAN'T USE IT IN OUR STATE. AND SO TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE IS NO ENSURE OR THAT HAS RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE NEW YORK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TO ALL GROUPS IN THEIR STAY BASED UPON WHAT YOU. CONSIDER EXAMPLES OF STATE OF THE NOTHING WORKED CHICAGO DO BOARD. AGES SIX. DETROIT AGAIN OF WAIT WHAT BE AFFECT BY THE SB ONE. TO DETROIT AND DETROIT IS A STATE IS A TOWN THAT HAS- OBSERVE SOME VERY. BIG CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRICE OF AUTO INSURANCE AND EXACTLY HOW THOSE PRICES ARE LEVIED ACROSS THE STATE. SO WHAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CITY THAT IS GOING TO LIKELY BENEFIT FROM THEIR CHANGE IN POLICY IN THE LAW ADOPTED. CHICAGO TO MY KNOWLEDGE I I'M THE EXHAUSTIVE STUDY BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE CHICAGO DOES NOT HAVE A SIMILAR LAW. THANK YOU. MISTER MARTINEZ TO RIP UP BECAUSE A WE HAVE A FEW OTHER PANELS HERE OF COURSE OF COURSE. NO JUST IN CLOSING AND CLEARLY MEAN- MY COLLEAGUE MISTER HENLEY HE'S BEEN THE LEAD.

SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE INDUSTRY HERE NO MISTER CHAN HAS A QUICK QUESTION BEFORE YOU DEPART MISTER MARTINEZ GO AHEAD MR CHEN. IN BRIEF AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PRESENTATION I DO APPRECIATE THAT- YOU MENTION PROP. ONE OH THREE BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT IF YOU FOR THE LETTER OF THE LAW PROPOSITION ONE OH THREE IT DOES STATE THAT DISK CAN BE GIVEN BROADLY AND GIVEN WITHOUT RESTRICTION. SO INSTEAD OF CHOOSING WHEN I FIRST WINNERS AND LOSERS WHY NOT FOLLOW THE LETTER OF THE LAW. PLEASE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHEN THAT'S IT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION AND- I THINK THIS BODY WOULD LIKELY AGREE WITH ME THAT. BETWEEN WRITING A LAW IN THIS BUILDING AND WRITING AN INITIATIVE. THERE IS MUCH CLEARER WORDING USUAL COMING OUT OF THIS BUILDING BEEN INITIATIVE MEASURES ANDSO. THE REASON I MENTION THIS. IS DEREK KEATING PROVISION WITHIN PROPOSITION ONE OH THREE AND THIS IS A CHALLENGE WE OBSERVE TIME AND AGAIN. IS HERE SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO AFFINITY GROUPS WE HAVE MULTIPLE COMPETING FOR JONES. ONE WE HAVE A- SET. THE YOU GROUP. IS ALLOWED CALIFORNIA PROP THREE THROUGHOUT REGARD TO ALL PATIENTS SO THEY CAN BE USED THAT'S ONE STATUTE THERE'S ANOTHER STATUTES SPECIFIC AUTO INSURANCE BUT SAYS NOTWITHSTANDING. ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW. THE ONLY RATING FACTORS YOU SHALL USE INSURERS IN THIS STATE THE THREE MANDATORY FACTORS IN ANY OPTIONAL FACTORS OF THE COMMISSION USES. THAT'S HOW YOU RATE INSURANCE IN THE STATE NO MORE OR LESS AS A COMPETING PROVISION WITH THE GROUP PROVISIONS. AND LASTLY BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T GEN THAT PROPER THREE SAYS RATES SHALL NOT BE UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY IT SPECIFICALLY REFERENCES THE UNRUH CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IN ADDITION TO THE UNFAIR DISCRIMINATION. **** ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS COMPETE AND THIS COMMISSIONER IS LOOKING AT HOW TO RECONCILE WAS A BIG BASS AND OF FAIR AVAIL. PORTABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU A RESPONSE ONE. QUESTION ON YOU SAID EARLIER ON THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS THIS- PERCEPTION THAT AT LEAST EXACT IS BENEFIT FROM THESE DISCOUNTS AT LEAST IN MY DISTRICT I AM GETTING SOME CALLS FROM SECRETARY IS FROM FROM EMTS THAT THE ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE DISCOUNT AS PART OF THEIR BUDGET IN TERMS OF HOW THEY FINANCE THEIR LIVELIHOOD- I UNDERSTAND THAT- EARLY ON A JANITORS GARDENERS WILL NOT BE ABLE FIT. ONLY BUT INSTEAD. ALIEN SOME. SWATH OF INDIVIDUALS THAT BENNETT FROM THROUGH THE DISCOUNTS WHY NOT CREATE- OF A CURRENT POLICY IN WHICH- THIS FOLKS THAT YOU STATED CORNERS JENNER'S COMPANION FROM THE DISCOUNTS ON ALIENATED FROM THE INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY THAT ALSO BENEFIT FROM THESE GROUP DISCOUNTS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAD IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AS WE HAVE THE DRAFT WORKSHOP THAT WE'RE REVIEWING REVIEWING THE COMMENTS WE RECEIVED ON THE STRAP BUT THE FIRST STEP. THE MULTI STEP PROCESS FOR DOING A ROOMMATE. ARE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE DO THAT IN A WAY THAT MAKES GROUP'S GOAL. ALL SO SIT BACK CLASS. I WOULD SAY THAT EXPAND. WILL NEARLY WITHOUT RESTRICTION. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. AND THE DATA SHOWS THAT DOESN'T WORK WE NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT DIFFERENT PROCESS THAT MAKE SURE THE GROUP DISCOUNTS CAN EXIST. BUT THEY'LL EXIST IN A WAY THAT IS UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY THAT IS NOT. UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY. ALL RIGHT ANYTHING ELSE MISTER MARTINEZ SIR MISTER HENLEY THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY OAK. MR VOEPEL HAS QUESTIONS. SORRY ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT I HEARD THIS CORRECTLY- WITHIN YOUR DATA AND YOUR ANALYSIS. I THANK YOU SAID YOU DID NOT HAVE CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT WITHIN THAT MAKES EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING- COMPLETELY USELESS BECAUSE WITHOUT CLAIMS EXPERIENCE YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH AFFINITY GROUP IS HIGH CLAIMS LOCAL NEWS WHATEVER. THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE HIGH CLAIMS ARE LOW CLAIMS AT CLAIMS IS EVERYTHING BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A KERRIER TAKE ON AN AFFINITY GROUP.

MISS ROGERS IS LIVE FIRST ON THE AGENDA WANT YOU GO AHEAD MISS ROGERS OKAY THANK YOU MY NAME IS ROGERS I'M THE ASSISTANT MANAGER OF MEMBER BENEFITS FOR THE CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ACTUALLY IN THE STATE BUILDING I'M SPEAKING APPRENTICE LATER SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE INSIGHT FROM THE MEMBER BENEFITS PERSPECTIVE. THE MAIN GOAL OF CTA MEMBER BENEFITS IS TO PROVIDE CJ MEMBERS WITH QUALITY MEMBER BENEFIT PROGRAMS THAT ARE BOTH COMPETITIVE. AND UNIQUE TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF OUR MEMBERSHIP. AND NOT ONLY DO REQUIRE THAT OUR VENDOR PARTNERS PROVIDE THOSE QUALITY PRODUCTS AT COMPETITIVE RATES BUT WE ALSO EXPECT SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FOR ALL MEMBERS TO BE TREATED EQUALLY AND FAIRLY. SO THIS EXPECT RELATES TO OUR ENTIRE DIVERSE MEMBERSHIP. I'M REFERRING TO A GROUP OF OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS. MORE THAN OF OUR MEMBERS ARE FEMALE. FORTY OF OUR MEMBERSHIP IS BETWEEN AGES OF THIRTY AND FIFTY NINE BUT WE ALSO HAVE A VERY WIDE RANGE OF AGE GROUPS AS WELL FROM THOSE IN THEIR EARLY TWENTY. IN ORDER HEARING RETIREMENT. OUR MEMBERS ARE FULL TIME THE KID EDUCATORS BUT WE ALSO ARE PROUD TO HAVE MEMBERS WHO ARE PART TIME EDUCATORS COMMUNITY COLLEGE MEMBERS. AND EDUCATION SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS WHO DRIVE THE BUSES PREPARE THE MEALS THE NURSES WERE FIXING THIS GREAT NEEDS IN THE GROUND THE MAINTENANCE STAFF THE CUSTODIANS PARA PROFESSIONALS OFFICE WORKERS. THAT ENTIRE. A MEMBER BENEFITS MAY PLAY A DIFFERENT ROLE IN ALL OF OUR MEMBERS LIVES BUT IT HAD IT IN. EACH NEVER THE LESS A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS ARE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND RELY ON OUR MEMBER BENEFIT PROGRAMS FROM HELPING THEM WITH THEIR DISCOUNTED OUR DAILY LIVES. OR IN LONG AND SHORT TERM INSURANCE NEEDS. I'M ARE FORTUNATE TO NOT IT REALLY NEED THE DISCOUNTS BUT APPRECIATE THE EXCLUSIVITY COMPONENT. ANY UNIT CALLED SWEEP THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY ALL AN ENJOY BY THE LONGING TO A LARGE ASSOCIATION LIKE CTA. NO MATTER WHAT THE NEEDS ARE THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME EXPECTATION AND THAT'S TRUSTING THAT CTA HAS VETTED. THE PARTNERS WE DOORS. BEING A MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATION OUR MEMBERS TRUST IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US AND THEREFORE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAMS WE ENDORSE IS ONE OF OUR MAIN GOALS. GAINING CJ ENDORSEMENT IS NOT AN EASY TASK AND WHEN THEY CAN TAKE ACTUALLY YEARS TO DEVELOP. ENDORSED PARTNERS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO A SET OF HIGH STANDARDS THAT ARE UNIQUE AND UNLIKE ANY OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS ARE MEMBERS CAN PURCHASE. OUR STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND UNIQUE PROGRAM ATTRIBUTES ALONG WITH THE HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE SO IMPORTANT TO US THAT THEY'RE WRITTEN IN OUR CJ BYLAWS. AND THEIR CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED AND EVALUATED TO ENSURE THAT THEY MAINTAIN THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED TO BE CONSIDERED A C. K. INDOORS PART. OUR MEMBERS BENEFIT PROGRAMS ARE PART OF OUR VALUE PROP. AND ARE ENDORSED PARTNERS ASSIST US WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP ENGAGEMENT AND RETENTION EFFORTS. CJ ENDORSEMENT IS NOT JUST LIKE ANY OTHER BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WE DO STRIVE TO DEVELOP LONG TERM PARTNERSHIPS FOR EXAMPLE OUR CJ ENDORSED PARTNER PROVIDING OUR AUTO AND HOME INSURANCE NEEDS CAL CASUALTY. IN OUR FOR ALMOST SEVENTY IS NOW. HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF BEING THERE FOR OUR MEMBERS AND THEIR GREATEST TIME OF NEED WE RESPECT CALIFORNIA CASUALTIES COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICE. AND OFFER COMPETITIVE RATES TO THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS THAT LOOK AFTER THE INTERESTS OF THE HEROES IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. BEING OUR PARTNER FOR SEVENTY YEARS THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR SENSITIVE TO AND RESPECTFUL TO OUR C CULTURE AND THIS UNDERSTANDING OF OUR CJ MEMBERSHIP HAS HELPED OUR PROGRAM EVOLVED INTO THE UNIQUE COVERS THAT OFFERS OUR MEMBERS TODAY. CALIFORNIA IS HEREBY SPUR BYLAWS AS THEY DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN MEMBERS JOB CLASSIFICATIONS THEY PROVIDE THE SAME COVERAGE TO OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE CLASSROOM IT. TEARS COMMUNITY COLLEGE EDUCATORS AND TERRY WORKERS. THE ASSISTANT OUR VALUE PROPOSITION EXCLUSIVITY MODEL BY ENSURING THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING THE CJ RATE. TO THE ACTIVE IN VERIFIED MEMBERS OF OUR ASSOCIATION. THEREFORE WE CANNOT SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY IMPAIR OR IMPACT OUR MEMBERS BEST INTEREST OR ARE INDOORS PARTNERS ABILITY TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. CJ IS NOT IN RELATION THAT REQUIRES THE CONFIDENTIAL CONTRACTS BETWEEN TGA CALIFORNIA CASUALTY BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION THE BUSINESS AGREEMENT WE ENTERED TO UNDER CONFIDENTIAL TERMS. NOT CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVATE. FURTHER CJ IS NOT IN FAVOR OF A DRAFT REGULATION THAT COULD IMPOSE NEW FILING AND DATE PORTING REQUIREMENTS UPON INSURERS. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS COULD ADD TO THE OVERALL COST OF OFFERING A LEGIT PROGRAM LIKE OURS. ULTIMATE LEAD TO HIGHER PRE OWNS OUR MEMBERS. ARE YOU CTA TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE THE WELL BEING OF OUR MEMBERS. AND THAT MEANS MAINTAINING OUR LOW PROVIDING ARE HARD WORKING SEATED MEMBERS WITH QUALITY UNIQUE MEMBER BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND AT A COMPETITIVE RATE AND ENSURING THAT ALL OF OUR MEMBERS ARE BEING TREATED. EQUALLY AND FAIRLY. THANK YOU SO SHIP COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM CTA. ALL RIGHT WITH. YOU COVERED IT THAT WAS VERY CLEAR THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH NOW WE'LL TURN TO A MISTER LUMBAR FROM THE BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WELCOME THERE THANK YOU. MY NAME'S AT MODEL NUMBER FROM THE PRESIDENCY OF THE CALIFORNIA BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE HAD SOME- INFORMATION PASSED UP TO YOU ALL THEIR LETTERS OF SUPPORT ALL OPPOSITE GEN OF NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSED REGULATORY CHANGES TO INSURANCE AFFINITY PROGRAMS AS YOU MAY KNOW I HAVE TESTIFIED TWICE BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ON THIS ISSUE TO ONLY HAVE THE CONCERNS OF LOW INCOME MINORITY COMMUNITIES IGNORED. ONCE AGAIN IS OR ARE BEING PUSHED ASIDE OVER IT ISSUE THAT IMPACT THE FINANCIAL WELL BEING OF OUR FAMILIES. THE BOOK OF CALIFORNIA'S WORK FORCE IS NON UNION. AND WHILE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR SOME OCCUPATIONAL GROUP DISCOUNTS THE PROPOSED REGULATION WOULD FORCE ON REASONABLE AND COSTLY REQUIREMENTS ON THEM TO JOIN IT EVEN. BY GROUP MEMBER. NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD A UNION. OR AFFILIATED GROUP MEMBERSHIP. AS A RESULT DISCOUNTS EARNED BY HARD WORKING FAMILIES WOULD CEASE TO EXIST. WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS. IF THE OPEN IF THE OPTION TO PURCHASE COST EFFECTIVE INSURANCE THROUGH AFFINITY GROUPS IS REMOVE THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT WE REPRESENT WILL BE THE FIRST TO FEEL THE EFFECTS. AN INCREASE IN THE COST AN AUTO INSURANCE TO THIS MAGNITUDE MAY FORCE ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CHAMBER MEMBERS AND OTHER RESIDENTS TO MAKE TOUGH CHOICES WHEN PLANNING THEIR YEARLY BUDGETS. PUTTING THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AT RISK. AS YOU KNOW MOST OF OUR OF COMMUNITY. WORK VERY SMALL MARGINS SO ANY CHANGE AND A DISCOUNT DOES GIVE IT TO THEM WE'LL HAVE IT AN INCREDIBLE AFFECT ON HOW THEY DO THINGS. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT YOU AND YOUR STAFF WILL CONSIDER THESE CONCESSIONS TO ENSURE. NOT AFFECTED. ALLOW FOR ON AFFILIATED GROUPS TO BE CREATED AND EASILY VERIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT SMALL BUSINESSES COMMUNITY GROUPS AND LOW INCOME POPULATIONS CAN OBTAIN DISCOUNTS WITHOUT BURDENSOME FILING REQUIREMENTS. THE GOAL WAS TO MAKE ACCESS TO THESE DISCOUNTS EASIER. PUTTING MORE RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE JUST LIMITS WHO CAN HAVE THESE DISCOUNTS. ELIMINATE THE DISCRIMINATORY REQUIREMENTS OF DUES AN ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP. REQUIRE COMPANIES TO VERIFY THAT THEY HAVE IN PLACE A PROCESS TO VERIFY MEMBERSHIP. THE DEPARTMENT COULD HELP CONSUMERS LEARN HOW TO USE AND SET UP GROUPS AND HOW TO WORK WITH INSURERS. THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD AND CREATE REASONABLE CRITERIA TO ENSURE THAT MEMBERS OF GROUPS HAVE SOME COMMON CHARACTERISTICS MAKE IT SIMPLE AND EASY FOR MEMBERSHIP GROUPS LIKE OURS TO VALIDATE THEIR AUTHENTICATION. MR GIPSON YOU ASKED ABOUT MARKETING AND HOW AE COMMUNITIES CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THESE AFFINITY GROUPS WILL. IF THE IF PART IT WOULD TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO PASS THIS INFORMATION ALONG THAT WOULD SATISFY YOUR YOUR YOUR AT YOUR QUESTION I DON'T THINK IT WAS ANSWERED PROPERLY WHEN YOU. GAVE IT OUT EARLIER WITHDRAW THE PROVISION AROUND SHARING PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL DATA WITH THE STATE. NOT WE WILL FORCE COMPANIES TO WITHDRAW THEIR PROGRAMS BUT POTENTIALLY WILL FORCE PRIVACY BREACHES AND REYES DATA BEING USED FOR ILLICIT EFFORTS AND WE'VE SEEN QUITE A BIT OF THAT HAPPENING IN SOCIETY TODAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER COMMITTEE WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE THIS RIGHT. BY PROTECTING THOSE IN THE STATE THAT DO NOT HAVE A VOICE. THAT ARE SO OFTEN OUT IN BY OVERZEALOUS STATE REGULATORS. WE STAND READY TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THIS COMMITTEE TO HELP MAKE THIS RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER LOMBARD- IN AGAIN VERY CLEARLY STATED AND WE APPRECIATE THE POINTS THAT YOU'RE MAKING. MR COOLEY I THINK WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT AT THIS POINT REGARDING THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE GO AHEAD RIGHT.  WANT TO SAY I LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND YOUR STAKE IN AND I THINK YOU'VE EXPRESSED YOUR STATE THIS IDEA THAT THERE ARE DISCOUNTS THAT THE PUBLIC IS ENJOYED THAT YOU SEE AT RISK. THANKS AS A MEMBER WILL TRY JUST FEEL OUR JOB IS TO STICK TO THE LAW. AND I WANT TO NOTE ARE. SINCE. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR CALIFORNIA LAW HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT THE JOB INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THIS IS TWELVE NINE TWENTY ONE INSURANCE CODE IS TO ADMINISTER THE LAW. THE TEST BUT WE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT SERVICE WAS OTHER STATES HAVE DIFFERENT RULES BY ADOPTING NEW LAW. WE HAVE THIS PROVISION. THAT I THINK SUPPORTS YOUR POSITION THE INTERESTED CONSUMERS THE FACT THE PEOPLE NOW FOR THREE DECADES OF ENJOY DISCOUNTS. OF THAT SAYS ANY INSURER MAY ISSUE ANY INSURANCE COVERAGE ON A GROUP PLAN. WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS THE GROUP OCCUPATIONAL TYPE OF GROUP. GROUP INSURANCE RATES SHOPPING CENTER BEEN FAIRLY DISCOVERED FOR IF YOUR AVERAGE BROADLY SO I THINK THE QUESTION THAT WE COME BACK TO IS THE LEGISLATURE ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS IS. OUR SYSTEM PERRANCE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. IS IT ACCORDING TO LAW UNDER THIS PROVISION. AND IT WAS NOT ACCORDING TO LAW THEY DON'T HAVE THE- ABILITY TO FREELANCE THEY HAVE TO ABIDE WITH THE LAW. AND ALSO SINCE EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES CALIFORNIA LAW HAS SAID. OF STATUTES PARTICULAR EXPRESSIONS WHICH IS WHAT EIGHTY SIX ONE POINT TWELVE IS PARTICULAR FIRST LAW SPECIFIC EXPRESSIONS. QUALIFY THOSE RICHARD GENERAL. SO WE HAVE THIS CAN OF CONSTRUCTION SAYS YOU GO FOR THE SPECIFIC. AND THAT TRUMPS THE GENERAL ARE. AND IN THE SAME WAY HEY. YOU KNOW THE COURTS HAVE SAID GENERALLY STATUTES HAVE A SPECIAL APPLICATION CONTROL GENERAL ONE WITHOUT REGARD TO DATE OF PASSAGE. A SPECIAL STATUTE DEALERS EXPRESSED WITH A PARTICULAR SOBRE CONTROLS TAKE PART OF A GENERAL STATUTE SO. I JUST WANT TO SAY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS. I FEEL WE HAVE AN INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WHOSE BOUNDARY IT HERE TO THE LAW. LOS QUITE CLEAR IN THE AREA THESE GROUPS. AND SO I THINK THE CONVERSATION IN THE CASE FOR CHANGE. NEEDS TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE SO ISSUES. FOR EXAMPLE OF CLAIMS EXPERIENCE. DID THE UP. ALL OF THESE THINGS EFFECTS BECAUSE RICHARD BE CONSIDERED. ARMED BUT BUT TO ME. CONSIDER WE HAVE HEARD. BENEFITING FROM THESE AND THAT WAS A FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF PROP ONE OF THREE IN ITS PURPOSE STATEMENT TO PROMOTE COMPETITION TO THE BENEFIT OF CONSUMERS SO I HAVEN'T HEARD HOW THIS APPROACH IS VIOLATED WITH THE PURPOSE OF% PROBLEM THREE BUT AGAIN THE CONSCIOUS ASK ABOUT COLLECTIONS THE CHURCH IS A STATE PROGRAM. YEAH MR COOLEY THANK YOU FOR THE FOR THE- HELPFUL BUT HISTORY LESSON AND- TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE POINTS THAT MR LOMBARDO MADE ANDA AND MISS ROGERS THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IS VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITTEE. AND THE LAST PANEL FOR THE HEARING TODAY. OUR STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES MR REX FRAZIER ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION AND CHUNK CHUCK MUNSON FROM CALIFORNIA CASUALTY. CALIFORNIA CASUALTY WAS MENTIONED AS THE- A PARTNER OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION FOR INSURANCE PURPOSES SO WHAT PLEASE GO AHEAD MR FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. MY NAME'S REX FRAZIER WITH PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO PRY TESTIMONY REGARDING THE CD EYES WORKING DRAFT OF AFFINITY GROUP REGULATIONS. AFFINITY GROUPS PROVIDE MILLIONS OF DRIVERS WITH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND AUTO INSURANCE DISCOUNTS EVERY YEAR. AND IF THE CD I. INTENDS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AFFINITY GROUP REGULATIONS WE URGE THEM TO ADOPT RULES THAT FURTHER EXPAND THE REACH OF GROUP DISCOUNTS IN PLACE. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL UNFORTUNATELY GOES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IN MANY CASES THE PROPOSAL WOULD ELIMINATE THE DRIVER'S ELIGIBILITY FOR A GROUP DISCOUNT THE HERE SHE CURRENTLY ENJOYS. AND MANY OTHER CASES THE PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE A DRIVER TO GIVE UP ONE OR MORE DISCOUNTS IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR CURRENT GROUP DISCOUNT. WE ARE HOPEFUL PUBLIC DIALOGUE SUCH AS TODAY'S HEARING WILL HIGHLIGHT LEGITIMATE CONCERNS WITH THE DRAFT PROPOSAL AND HELP THE CD I CRAFT A REVISED VERSION. THAT WORKS ALL CALIFORNIANS. NOT ONLY OTHER POLICY PROBLEMS WITH THE THIS REGULATION THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ISSUES. THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE EXPLICIT PERMITS GROUP PLANS WITHOUT DIRECTION AS TO THE PURPOSE. OF THE- OCCUPATION OR TYPE OF GROUP. YEAH THE LAW IS CLEAR THE GROUP INSURANCE RATE SHALL. ON FOR. BUT TORY AS LONG OUR AVERAGE BROAD AMONG MEMBERS. HOWEVER THE PROPOSED STATION IS THE WHICH OF FOR ONE OF THREE AND WOULD UNDO THE MANY GROUP INSURANCE OPTIONS THAT THE CD I ITSELF HAS APPROVED OVER SEVERAL DECADES. THE POPE REGULATIONS PROVIDES TO FIX THESE POLICY AND LEGAL CONCERNS. AND AS THE CDI CONSIDERS ITS NEXT STEPS WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE FOLLOWING REVISIONS TO THE CURRENT ACT. FIRST TO LIMIT THE DRAFT REGULATION TO AUTO INSURANCE ONLY THE CD I HAS NOT PRODUCED ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE GROUP MARKET BEYOND AUTO INSURANCE. SECOND ELIMINATE THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT THAT A DRIVER CAN ONLY OBTAIN A DISCOUNT THROUGH AN EMPLOYER UNION OR OTHER GROUP TO WHICH THE DRIVER PAYS DUES OR FEES. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE BRIDGE CAN OBTAIN DISCOUNTS BASED UPON THEIR JOB JOB TRAINING OR JOB CERTIFICATIONS WITHOUT BEING FORCED TO PAY DUES ARE A FEW TO ANYONE. SHOULD AN EMPLOYEE ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO A GROUP DISCOUNT FROM THE INSURER THAT MANAGEMENT OF AN EMPLOYER CHOOSES. HEARD ELIMINATE THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT THE GROUP DISCOUNTS MUST INVOLVE A WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN AN ORGANIZATION AND AN INSURER. AND FOR THOSE THOSE DISCOUNT PROGRAMS CURRENTLY IN OPERATION THAT YOU INVOLVE A WRITTEN AGREEMENT. ELIMINATE THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT THAT THE ORGANIZATION IN THE INSURER PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THE PRINT THIS BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT. FOURTH MAKE THE FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR AFFINITY GROUP PROGRAMS REALISTIC PARTICULARLY THE PROPOSED REQUIREMENT THAT AN INSURER WOULD AFFIRMATIVELY MUST DISPROVE THAT IS VIOLATING CIVIL RIGHTS LAW IN ORDER TO GET AN APPROVAL. PROPERLY APPLIED THE UNRUH ACT- TO SAY THE LEAST THE PROPOSAL GOES WELL BEYOND CASE LAW. AND WE COULD SPEND I HAVE. YEAH BUT WHAT I'M THE PROCESS FOR VERIFYING THAT A DRIVER ACTUALLY QUALIFIES FOR A GROUP DISCOUNT WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS BUT THE VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND PROPOSED DRAFT ARE SIMPLY COMMERCIALLY UNREASONABLE. THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER WHETHER THE CURRENT GROUP INSURANCE MARKETS SERVICE ALL COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE COMMISSIONER TO ELIMINATE THESE CONCERNS AND LOOK TO FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM THIS. GUY ON WHICH TYPE GROUP COMES ARE UNDER REPRESENT THE MARKET. WE BELIEVE THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE COMMISSIONER TO PLAY IN SPURRING ADDITIONAL DISCOUNT THROUGH SOME TYPE OF MARKET ASSISTANCE MECHANISM YEAH. LATER THIS WEEK WILSON DETAILED SUGGESTIONS TO THE CD I FOR HOW TO A COP THE ABOUT CHANGING. OUR GOAL IS TO CAN ON A- RESERVE EXIST DRIVER ACCOUNTS WELL EXPECT THE SUBJECT DISK FOR MORE SHOULD. BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER OTHER ANY QUESTIONS FOR. MR VOEPEL GO AHEAD SO MISTER FRAZIER- ON. THE INDUSTRY. WHY DON'T WE HAVE OR DO WE AVE I'D MIND NOT EVEN BE AWARE OF IT A LOW INCOME AFFINITY GROUP FOR GOOD DRIVERS. I INCOME. LOW INCOME AFFINITY GROUP FOR GOOD DRIVERS IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU'RE BELOW A CERTAIN INCOME CHAIR YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AN AFFINITY GROUP THAT WOULD GIVE YOU A DISCOUNT I HAVE A GOOD DRIVER RECORD- BUT NOT AWARE OF GROUPS THAT ARE ARE PRESENTLY FIVE WITH AN APPROVED BY THE I'M SURE THAT INCLUDING COM OR THE THAT WOULD BE PART F AN APP. THAT CARE. RISKY CERTAINLY BUT THE TYPES OF GROUP DISCOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN PREDOMINANT OVER TIME HAVE RELATED TO- THE TYPE OF JOB OR TRAINING OR MEMBERSHIP TO EDUCATION WHAT SAMPLE I'M NOT ASSOCIATION OF YOU KNOW SOME SOMETHING LIKE THAT- AND SO COULD BE RELATED TO INCOME BUT A AT THIS POINT I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT APPROVAL FILING LIKE IMPORTANT. FOR THREE DECADES INTO THIS IF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THOUGHT ANY GROUP THAT'S PRESENTLY APPROVED WAS INAPPROPRIATE THEY WOULD HAVE DISAPPROVED. YOU KNOW WE'RE RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT AS IF YOU CAN AS A CARRIER JUST DECIDE YOU WANT TO- HAVE A GROUP AND THEN JUST GO ABOUT OFFERING A CHANGED PRICE FOR THAT GROUP YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE SO IT'S A FAIRLY ARDUOUS PROCESS- WE WOULD CERTAINLY ARE YOU THAT THE BEST THING THE DEPARTMENT COULD DO. IS TO MAKE THE APPROVAL OF GROUP- PROGRAMS EASIER- SO THAT IT'S SOMETHING CARRIERS WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO DO RIGHT NOW IT GETS CAUGHT UP IN A PRETTY COMPLICATED PROCESS FOR ONE QUESTION. ALL RIGHT. IF YOU CAN'T GO WITH INCOME WHY NOT HAVE BECAUSE OF THE INSURANCE. GUYS GIVE US. DETAILED LISTS. PRINT IT IS. WHAT IF ANY RED OR PINK AREA. WOULD QUALIFY FOR A GOOD DRIVER. AFFINITY DISCOUNTS. IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION CERTAINLY- THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE PRESENTLY- ALLOWS ONE COMPONENT OF THE RATE BEING THE GARAGING ADDRESS OF THE DRIVER IN THE LOS- EXPERIENCE AROUND THAT GARAGING ADDRESS NOW THAT IS LIMITED UNDER THEIR CD I REGULATIONS. AT THAT IMPACT CAN NEVER EXCEED THE WAIT FOR IT TO THE THIRD MANDATORY FACTOR OF YEARS AND DRIVING EXPERIENCE SO BUT CERTAINLY- FREQUENCYLOSS AND SEVERITY OF LOS BY GARAGING ADDRESS IS A LONG APPROVED RATING FACTOR IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM UNDERSTOOD ONE LAST COMMENT. ON WHAT I'M LOOKING AT THE DO YOU HAVE INSURANCE ONE TEEN IS THAT GOOD DRIVERS THAT ARE LOWER INCOME PER CAPITA OF BE ALSO. HAVE DISCOUNTS THROUGH AN OF ENERGY GROUP. AVAILABLE THEY CAN CERTAINLY BY AN INDIVIDUAL POLICY AND QUALIFY FOR IT. HE YELLED AT A PRICE THIS IS WHITER THAN JUST GOOD DRIVERS RIGHT THIS IS ALL THIS IS ALL DRIVERS REGARDLESS OF YOUR YOUR NPR- WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN THEN DISCOUNT SO THIS IS FOR. THE DRIVERS THE HARD PART FOUR INCH- RAISES THEY'LL THEY'LL MAKE A FILING THAT SAYS WE HAVE DATA TO SUGGEST THAT THIS PARTICULAR GROUP. IS WERE LOWER LOS. LIKELY HAD. AND THEY'LL FILE THAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND THEN. IF APPROVED THEY CAN IMPLEMENT THAT IN THE MARKET WHERE. WHEN SOMEONE IS APPLYING THEY CAN DETERMINE THAT SOMEONE. QUALIFY THIS PARTICULAR DISCOUNT. OFTENTIMES INSURERS DON'T CONTROL ALL WHO COMES INTO THEIR BOOK OF BUSINESS BECAUSE- THERE'S TAKE ALL COMERS PROVISION. DRIVERS AND UNDER THE STATUTORY MISSION WE'VE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD 7080% OF DRIVERS ARE GOOD DRIVERS. SO THAT MEANS 78280% OF APPLICANTS THE INSURER MUST ACCEPT. REGARD AND THEN IF THE PERSON QUALIFIES FOR A DISCOUNT THAT BECOMES PART OF THEIR RATING METHODOLOGY SO. SO IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT THAT MAP BUT THEN CONNECTED TO WHAT DOES THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTED INSURANCE COMPANY TO DO THEY'RE THEY'RE- THEY'RE NOT. ALLOWED TO INTAKE BASED UPON. ZIP CODE. RIGHT THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT ANYONE WHO COMES IN THEY HAVE A SEPARATELY APPROVED DISCOUNT PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID. THAT THE THAT CARRIER JUST BY THE ACCOUNT TO BE OFFERED AS THEY APPLY THAT AS PART OF THE RATING PROCESS. SO HOW DO YOU SORT CONNECT THESE TWO ISSUES WE DON'T YET UNDERSTAND IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ARGUMENTS WILL BE USING THIS PER CAPITA IN I'M- MEASURE. THAT COST THE BITTER FUSION. ON THE ONE HAND GOING TO THAT AGENCY. LOOK PACKED. DIVIDED QUINTILES IN HOUSE MAJORITY OF GROUP DISCOUNT BENEFICIARIES AND THEIR OWN STUDY ARE IN ZIP CODES WERE THE PER CAPITA INCOME IS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS RIGHT AND SO THAT'S NOT EVEN POVERTY LINE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SO WHEN YOU SEE A GROUP DISCOUNT PROGRAM AT BY THEIRUP MEASURES IS. WHAT WHAT WHAT THE OF BENEFIT IN. BOB PERK PRAC PER CAPITA INCOME LEVELS ZIP CODES A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS AND THEN BE TOLD THAT THERE IS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE SUGGESTING WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EACH YEAR HOW THEY'RE USING THAT DATA THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU MISTER WILL FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND LETS. OUT A MISTER SIN FROM CALIFORNIA CASUALTY MISTER FRAZIER THANK YOU VERY MUCH GO AHEAD SIR. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN THE MEMBERS THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU THIS MORNING. MY NAME IS CHUCK MUNSON I REPRESENT CALIFORNIA CASUALTY WHERE I'M SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF CUSTOMER SERVICE UNDERWRITING AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. CALIFORNIA CAVALRY BEGAN IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN REDDING WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. OVER TIME THE COMPANY SHIFTED ITS FOCUS TO PERSONAL LINES ALMOST SEVENTY YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE WE ACTUALLY PIONEERED THE PERSONAL LINES GROUP SPONSORSHIP APPROACH BY PARTNERING WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY AUTO AND HOMEOWNERS COVERAGE IN SERVICE AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. WE'VE TRAVELS DOZENS OF ADDITIONAL PARTNERSHIPS OVER THE YEARS WITH OTHER CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS IN THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND PUBLIC SAFETY. INCLUDING FIFTY YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HIGHWAY PATROLMAN. WE HAVE A Y. WE EXIST STATEMENT THAT WE LIVE BY AS A COMPANY. FULL WHO COMMIT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE FINANCIAL PROTECTION WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF CARE SERVICE COMPASSIONATE UNDERSTANDING WHICH IS. IN A NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CONSUMER REPORTS STUDY OF ATO INSURERS WE TIED FOR FIFTH OUT OF FIFTY TWO COMPANIES IN THE STUDY. OUR PRIMARY CONCERNS ARE THAT THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE THE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO BY PRIVATE ENTITIES AND THAT THEY WOULD EXPERT IMPOSE RATE FILING AND DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE FOR ANY CASUAL. TO COMPLY WITH. THESE COULD AFFECT JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE COVERAGE AND SERVICE TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF OUR GROUP PARTNERS AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. THE REGULATIONS AS DRAFTED IMPOSE BURDENSOME FILING DATA REPORTING AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AS MENTIONED. THAT WE DO FEEL ARE GOING TO IN THE END DRIVE UP THE PREMIUM FOR OUR GROUP MEMBERS AND DIMINISH THE VALUE OF THAT BENEFIT FOR THEIR FOR THEIR GROUP MEMBERS. THERE ARE SOME IN ELEMENT TO IT. MOVING THE RATING FROM A. EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE TWELVE GENERAL RATE LEVEL FOR GROUP OVER TO THE INDIVIDUAL RATING ALGORITHM OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE OR TWO WAY THAT WILL SUBSUME THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GROUP. SHIP WAY DOWN THE LIST OF OPTIONAL RATING FACTORS AND MATHEMATICALLY WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY DIMINISH THE VALUE AND BENEFIT OF THOSE GROUP DISCOUNTS. THANK YOU. ARE THERE QUESTIONS FOR MISTER MUNSON. AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THAT YOU HAVE RELATIONSHIPS- BEYOND THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WITH THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND- IN OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THANK YOU FOR THAT. IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WE THANK THIS PANEL FOR YOUR INSIGHT AND YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

SEARCH RIGHTS. A LOW INCOME IMMIGRANT ANOTHER ADVOCACY GROUPS THAT SUPPORT THE REGULATIONS AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO READ A STATEMENT THAT I JUST RECEIVED FROM MISTER BOB HUNTER HE WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WHO IS AN EXPERT WORSE FOR CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA I HAVE AN EMAIL SAYING THAT FROM MISTER HUNTER NEITHER ALL I NOR CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA HAVE EVER SUPPORTED THE USE OF SO CALLED AFFINITY GROUPS WHEN WE FIRST OF ALL BUT IDEA OF TRUE GROUP.

PROVIDE THIS TO YOU IT'S AN EMAIL SO I CAN SEND IT OUT BUT IN BRIEF AND I LOVE TRAVEL WILL BE ADDITIONAL TIME BECAUSE WE DO WORK IN THIS AREA. UP THE GROUP. GROUPS SHOULD BE REAL LIVE MEMBERS WERE IN THE PROPOSAL AN EMPLOYER CAN CONSTITUTE A GROUP RATHER THAN A FIGMENT OF THE IMAGINATION OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY WHICH IS ALMOST ENTIRELY. WHETHER YOU HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF ADVANCED EDUCATION OR A JOB TITLE THAT SUGGEST YOUR HIGHER INCOME PERSON AND THEY BENEFIT WITHOUT BEING MEMBERS OF A REAL GROUP THAT SITS DOWN LIKE THE CTA AND OTHERS AND NEGOTIATES WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES NOTHING IN THESE WERE ELECTIONS. TO THE CURRENT EXISTENCE OF REAL GROUPS THAT HAVE THEIR OWN LIFE AND THAT ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR DISCOUNTS COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT SOME OF THE DISCLOSURE OF PROVISIONS OF THE OF THE REGULATION WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THAT BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT GROUP DISCOUNTS SHOULD BE BETWEEN REAL GROUPS THAT REALLY EXIST HAVE REMEMBERS THAT CAN THEN NEGOTIATE.

PLEASE GO FOR GOOD MORNING I AM PASTOR ROBERT JONES OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BLACK PASTORS. AND WE'RE HERE TO OPPOSE THIS- STATEMENT THAT AN EFFORT THAT THE COMMISSIONER SAYS IS WRONG- AND HE'S WRONG. WHEN HE IMPUGNED IS THIS- THESE AFFINITY DISCOUNTS AS BEING DISCRIMINATORY AND DRIVING UP THE COST OF INSURANCE FOR ORDINARY CALIFORNIANS. OF IS COMMISSION IS GOING TO BE AN ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THOSE FOLKS THAT FEEL DISCRIMINATED AGAINST PERHAPS HE SHOULD. DIRECT THOSE EFFORTS TO- PROMOTING DISCOUNTS AND EFFORTS TO SPREAD AND EXPAND THESE SENATE A GROUP DISCOUNTS TO THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE TYPICALLY AND- HISTORICALLY- SYSTEMATICALLY. TO SERVE. AND ILL INFORMED AND ELY QUICK AND SO- THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE CONSTITUENTS. FEEL THAT THEY ARE SENATE IN MANY CASES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE THEY'RE BUSY DEALING WITH THE DAY TO DAY ISSUES- WHEN THE COST OF INSURANCE GOES UP YOU TAKE AWAY THIS DISCOUNT THEN THEY HAVE THEY THEY'RE OPERATING ON A VERY SMALL MARGARINES AND WHEN IT COMES TO LOWERING INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR ORDINARY CALIFORNIA'S DEATH DISCOUNT. IN FACT IT'S NOT THE PROBLEM IT'S SOLUTION. THAT A BIRD NAY THESE GROUPS WITH EXCESSIVE RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY- THE COMMITTEE SHOULD LOOK TO IT AND ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS AS A VET OF THE UNITED STATES I AM NOT PROUD TO RECEIVE THE DISCOUNT. TO GET THROUGH MY WORK WHICH IS HERE TO. BUT I THINK THAT ALL OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. SHOULD RECEIVE DISCOUNTS FROM THOSE AFFINITY GROUPS AND DO NOT. TAKE THOSE AWAY IT'S THE WRONG THING TO DO AND I THINK WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE OUR COMMISSIONER AND THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE WITH THIS AND EXPANDED AND PUT. THE LEFT. IS JOHN. HI CARLOS MARQUEZ ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION FIRST THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THE OVERSIGHT HEARING AND GIVING ATTENTION AND CARE TO THE ISSUE AT HAND- WE WANT TO JUST OFFER OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSED RULE CHANGE- WE CAN'T WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE IMPACT ON OUR SECTOR- COULD AMOUNT TO TWENTY THOUSAND OR MORE CHARTER SCHOOL TEACHERS LOSING- SUCH DISCOUNTS AND WE BELIEVE THAT DISCOUNTS RANGE FROM TWO TO FIVE THAT SO. MOUNTING A FEW DOLLARS A REALLY DOES I PROPORTIONATELY IMPACT FOLKS DO FOLKS BUT OTHERS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER ARE REALLY BUDGETING AND THE MARGINS WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A HISTORIC TEACHER SHORTAGE AND WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PUT X.

TO SHARE A FEW POINTS IS. SPINNING THE ALUMNI INDUSTRY FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. AND SHARE SOMEPERSPECTIVES ON THE VALUE THAT AFFINITY DISCOUNT PROGRAMS BRING TO ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS. AND TO ALUMNI. WE HAVE FOUND THAT RECENT GRADUATES WERE JUST DURING THE WORK FORCE OR ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BENEFITS OF DISCOUNTS AND AS COST OF LIVING INSURANCE COSTS AND CERTAINLY OTHER MANDATORY EXPENSES ARE EVER GROWING CERTAINLY HERE. FOR YA THOSE WHO ARE JUST START A CAREER PATH. SHE THESE DISCOUNTS FOR NECESSARY EXPENSES SUCH AS INSURANCE. ADDITIONALLY FOR IN ALMA MATER IF WE CAN BEGIN TO PROVIDE THESE DISCOUNTS AND THESE PIECES THROUGH OUR ORGANIZATIONS. THAT HELPS BUILD AFFINITY BETWEEN A LOT NINETY INSTITUTION AND THAT HELPS PROVIDE FEWER EXPORT ENGAGEMENT FOR ONE'S ALMA MATER. WITH THE SERVICE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE BY VIRTUE OF HAVING PARTNERSHIP SUCH AS THESE WE CAN MAKE. AND OFFER. TO OUR ALUMNI INTO OUR FUTURE ALUMNI WHICH IS THE MISSION OF OUR ORGANIZATION. TO CURTAIL THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THESE PROGRAMS BY EITHER THE PROVIDER OR THE ORGANIZATION WOULD HAVE A TRULY DEEP IMPACT ON THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT WE ARE ABLE B.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AMY SCHMIDT AND LIKE THE PRECEDING SPEAKER SAID I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES BUT FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE I'M A GRADUATE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LIKE MOST INDIVIDUALS FROM MY GRADUATING CLASS I'VE STRUGGLE TO FIND FULL TIME WORK IN MY FIELD FORCING ME TO JUGGLE MULTIPLE TEMPORARY PART TIME JOBS JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. HOWEVER AVAILABLE TO ME AS AN ALUM OF A C. IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT I'M ABLE TO AFFORD MY CAR INSURANCE WHICH IS CRUCIAL WHEN I SPEND A LARGE PART OF MY DAY GETTING FROM GIG TO GIG THESE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WERE DRAFTED IN AN ATTEMPT AT LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD WHEN IT COMES TO WHO QUALIFIES FOR AFFINITY GROUP DISCOUNTS. HOWEVER THEY ARE MY OPTICALLY NEARING THE SCOPE AND DEMONIZING BENEFICIARIES OF AFFILIATED GROUPS RATHER THAN CREATE MORE AWARENESS AND ACCESS WHEN A LOT OF THE POPULATION WITH COLLEGE DEGREES STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS TO MAKE EVERY MONTH ON AND DOUBLES THREE IS GETTING PAY. I CAN AFFINITY GROUP DISCOUNT. BOB I KNOW OF COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BUYING GROCERIES AND PAYING THEIR PREMIUMS EVERY MONTH. I'M AN ALUMNA AND MY COLLEGE DEGREE DOES AFFORD ME THE PRIVILEGE QUALIFYING FOR THIS DISCOUNT. BUT HAVING A COLLEGE DEGREE IN TWENTY TWENTY DOESN'T NECESSARILY EQUATE TO SUSTAINABLE INCOME. THIS DISCOUNT MATTERS TO ME AND COUNTLESS COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO OFTEN LIVE WITH THREE TO FOUR OTHER PEOPLE JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. WHILE I APPRECIATE MR MARTINEZ AND MR HANLEY'S CONCERNS FOR DIVERSITY I WOULD ASK THEM TO EXPAND THEIR VIEW TO ALL COLLEGE GRADUATES. PARTICULARLY THE ONES LEAVING SCHOOL TO MARKET OF SMALLER SALARIES AND RISING RUNS. INSTEAD OF SHRINKING THE AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES WE EDUCATED MMHM WE NEED TO EDUCATE MORE PEOPLE ABOUT HOW TO USE THEM.

HE HAD STRUGGLE WITH HIS BODY AND THE ADVICE- FOR HIS HEART PROBLEM WAS TO DRINK A LOT OF CREAM. AS IN TO STRENGTHEN HIMSELF AND TO FATTEN HIMSELF UP. OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS THE MEDICINE THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY CONTRARY TO EVERYTHING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE HE HAD A HEART ATTACK AND HE DIED. SOMETIMES SOLUTION IS SOMETIMES PROBLEMS ARE EGGNOG ARE RECOGNIZED AND I THINK THAT COULD THE DEPARTMENT HAS IDENTIFIED A CHALLENGE OF A LACK OF EQUITY BUT THE SOLUTION IS NOT TO JUST TAKE IT AWAY FROM EVERYONE. THE SOLUTION IS TO GO JUST IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION DOUBLE DOWN ON THE NOTION THAT AFFINITY GROUPS ARE A GOOD THING THIS STATE FOR BUILDING SOCIAL CAPITAL FOR STRENGTHENING OUR COMMUNITIES SO FOR INSTANCE YES WE'VE HEARD. SOME YOU HAVE A FIT IN THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN IN A TO DO SO BY THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE BUT THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ENABLE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN BUILT. INTO THIS IDEA THIS PROGRAM SO FOR INSTANCE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE WHO ARE CHURCH LEADERS HOW MANY CHURCHES HAVE BEEN APPROACHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF. INSURANCE TO. DETERMINE HOW TO HOLD AFFINITY GROUP OUT OF THEIR MEMBERSHIP. YOU KNOW. WHAT THE WITH THE SET WITH THE CRUSHING OF THIS SYSTEM RATHER LET'S BUILD IT UP INTO A ROBUST ODD OF THE ACCOUNT. I'M ALL ALIVE YOUR ROOM. MISTER COOL BECAUSE I DO QUESTION HOW THE DEPARTMENT CAN MOVE FULLY FORWARD WITH THIS. SIDE OF THE WILL OF JUST LET IN THE PROCESS. ALSO SAY I'M GOING. MR GIBSON'S PER. THAT REALLY THIS IS A- CHIU. NOT ABOUT SOME SORT OF.

PART SEVEN WITH AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION WHILE THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING A HEARING TODAY IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO SEE SAID AS A DEMOCRACY AND ACTION I THINK THIS COUPLE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE POINTED OUT.
