TO THANK YOU FOR IN THE BILL OUT IN SECONDS THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH HAPPY TO COME BACK ANY TIME- IT. WHATEVER IT TAKES ON A. GOOD AFTERNOON I CHAIR AND MEMBERS HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN EIGHTEEN REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IS UNDER ASSAULT ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY AND OUR WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN PROTECTING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS I. MANY CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO LACK ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IN FACT 40% OF CALIFORNIA COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE ABORTION PROVIDER THIS BILL WILL CREATE A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICE COURT IN CALIFORNIA THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION INSPIRED BY THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS THIS PROPOSAL WILL GREATLY STRENGTHEN OUR HEALTH CARE EDUCATION PIPELINE BY RECRUITING TRAINING AND RETAINING. A DIVERSE WORK FORCE OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ARE PROUD TO BE WORKING WITH THE TRAFFIC COALITION OF PARTNERS ON THIS BELL AND- I WOULD NOW LIKE TO INTRODUCE FLOOR HUNTED TEACH AND AS DALY CARRASCO AND ARE IN STUDENT NURSE MIDWIFE AT UC SAN FRANCISCO. MOTION THE MOTION AND REFERRING. SECOND BY MR IS IT WOULD KNOWS THIS BILL NEEDS TO GET OUT HERE REALLY QUICKLY TO GET OVER TO HIGHER EDUCATION. THIS IS. YOUR WITNESSES SO AND BEATEN. THE MOTION BY MISSISSAUGA CURRY SECOND BY MISTER NAZARIAN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON- WOULD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS FOR HUNT I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TEACHER TRAINING IN EARLY ABORTION FOR COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. I AM A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL- TEACHERS AN ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES ABORTION TRAINING AND MENTORSHIP- TO ENSURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CHAMPIONS I AM VERY EXCITED TO BE WORKING ON THIS BILL WITH ASSEMBLYWOMAN CONNIE PETRIE-NORRIS THAT WOULD CREATE. THE CALIFORNIA REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICE CORPS. AYE SHE'S MENTIONED THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED FIFTY YEARS AGO AND AB NINETEEN EIGHTEEN WILL DO FOR ABORTION CARE ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT THE NHS CEDAR FOR PRIMARY CARE ACCESS IN UNDERSERVED AND RURAL AREAS. THERE'S COLLAR SHIPS AND STIPENDS FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE HEALTHCARE TEAM AB NINETEEN CREATES ACTION EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS. THAT MEET THE REAL NEEDS OF DIVERSE EXPIRING HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. WE CANNOT GET SERIOUS ABOUT DIVERSIFYING OUR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH WORKFORCE WITHOUT INVESTING UP FRONT IN THEIR EDUCATION THEIR MENTORSHIP AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT. THIS UP FRONT INVESTMENT WILL ENSURE OUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS BETTER REFLECT THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART THIS BILL ALSO ADDRESSES THE SHORTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR ABORTION TRAINING. ROGER IT'S OF THE TEACH PROGRAM ARE AMONG THE LUCKY FEW PARTY OF ONLY 6% OF FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENTS GUARANTEED ABORTION TRAINING BY THE RESIDENCY. AND FOR ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSES ABORTION TRAINING IS EVEN LESS ACCESSIBLE. I URGE YOU TO VOTE EIGHT ON AB NINETEEN EIGHTEEN SO THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE STRONGEST BEST TRAINED REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH WORK FORCE IN THE COUNTRY CAPABLE OF CARING FOR EVERY PERSON SEEKING CARE IN OUR GREAT STATE THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU MISS HUNT AND I THINK AND WE'LL HAVE OUR SECOND WITNESS JUST BE AVAILABLE TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SHOULD ADD. THEY HAVE THEM. THANK YOU. BUT THERE IS A. THERE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KATHLEEN JONES I'M LAST WEEK THERE WAS TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AND ONE OF MY ASSOCIATES WAS HERE TO TESTIFY SHE WASN'T ABLE TO COME TODAY SO I'D LIKE TO GIVE HER TESTIMONY HER NAME IS SONIA BATES AND SHE'S A VOLUNTEER WITH THE SAMBAR DINO PREGNANCY AND FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER SHE'S LED ABORTION RECOVERY FOR FIFTEEN YEARS TO HELP WOMEN HEAL FROM THE TRAUMA OF ABORTION. SHOUTS CLARITY ABOUT ABORTION IT'S NOT AN ABSTRACT WORD. THAT SIMPLY. YOU HEAR ON THE NEWS SHE CHOSE TO ABORT TWO OF HER OWN CHILDREN. AND THROUGH OUR WORK SHE'S MET DOZENS OF WOMEN'S WHO DID LIKEWISE SOME EARLY IN THE PREGNANCY AND OTHER SUPPORTING LATE TERM. SOME HAD ONE ABORTION REMEMBER. SHE IS LED GROUPS THAT ARE DIVERSE IN AGE ETHNICITY INCOME AND EDUCATION BUT ALL HAVE HAD ONE OR MORE ABORTIONS EVERYONE IS CRIPPLED EMOTIONALLY FROM THIS EXPERIENCE MANY CAN EVEN SAY THE WORD ABORTION MUCH LESS SHOUTED. SOME HAVE VIVID MEMORIES THAT HAUNT THEM WHILE OTHERS LIKE SONIA WORKED HARD TO SUPPRESS IT DETAILS THE TRAUMA COMES FROM THE FACT THAT WE ALL KNOW IT'S ALWAYS WRONG TO KILL AN INNOCENT HUMAN BEING WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT ABORTION DOES. BUT WE RATIONALIZE WHICH IS A LOT OF WORK SO WE FIND PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT US IN OUR SELF DECEPTION WHICH IS THE ABORTION INDUSTRY IS PLEASED TO DO. THAT'S WHAT AB NINETEEN EIGHTEEN SCHOLARSHIPS WILL FIND MORE TRAINING TO DECEIVE WOMEN THAT ABORTION AND ITS SIDE EFFECTS. SO YET ABORTED HER FIRST CHILD AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN AND AFTER THE FAMILY DOCTOR WROTE THE WORDS THERAPEUTIC ABORTION ON A PRESCRIPTION PAD. SHE RECALLS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE ACTUAL ABORTION BECAUSE SHE INTENTIONALLY SUPPRESSING MEMORY BUT CLEARLY REMEMBERS THE WORDS ON THE PAINT PAD THERAPEUTIC. RELATING TO HEALING OF THE DISEASE IT WASN'T SEIZE IT WITH THE PREGNANCY. AND CERTAINLY SHE WASN'T HEALED FROM THAT ABORTION. ABORTION HAS AN ENORMOUSLY NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON EMOTIONAL HEALTH. AND THE WAY WE BEHAVE. THROUGH PREGNANCY AFTER A FEW YEARS SHE ONCE AGAIN CHOSE A FORTUNE BUT THIS TIME WAS DETERMINED TO BE UTTERLY DETACHED EVEN OFFERING TO PAY HALF OF THE ABORTION BECAUSE IT TOO TO GET PREGNANT. SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THE ABORTION HERSELF. THAT REMEMBERS THE CALLOUSNESS RESPONSE MUCH LATER THROUGH THE ABORTION RECOVERY PROGRAM HAS RECEIVED HEALING FROM THE SO CALLED THERAPEUTIC ABORTION. TODAY I HELP HEAL OTHER WOMEN FROM THE PAIN THAT WAS SUFFERED THROUGH ABORTION DO NOT FUND THE SCHOLARSHIP FOR ABORTION PROVIDERS THEY DON'T NEED HELP WOMEN NEED HEALING FROM ABORTION NOT MORE DECEPTION AND TRAUMA MY ASK IS THAT YOU VOTE NO ON A. B. NINETEEN EIGHTEEN. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MY NAME IS THERESA BRENNAN I'M A CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY AND A THIRD GENERATION PRO LIFE ACTIVIST AND PRESIDENT OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE LEAGUE AMERICA'S FIRST PRO LIFE ORGANIZATION. REPRESENTING FIFTY TWO MEMBER PREGNANCY HELP CLINICS CENTERS AND MATERNITY HOMES IN EVERY ONE OF YOUR DISTRICTS AND TENS AND THOUSANDS OF PRO LIFE VOTERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ABORTION IS A MEDICAL PROCEDURE THAT CARRIES WITH IT GREAT RISK FOR INJURY AND COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING BLEEDING TISSUE RETENTION AND INFECTION UTERINE DAMAGES SUCH AS UTERINE PERFORATION AND TOTAL LOSS OF FERTILITY FOLLOWING ABORTIONS. THE STATED INTENT OF AB NINETEEN EIGHTEEN IS TO TRAIN AN ARMY OF ABORTIONISTS WHO WILL TARGET THE CHILDREN OF POOR UNDERSERVED AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES. THE BILL SETS UP AS STATE FUNDED SCHOLARSHIP TO TRAIN DOCTORS MIDWIVES NURSES AND PHYSICIANS ASSISTANTS. TO PRACTICE IN ONE NARROW ASPECT OF HEALTHCARE ABORTIONS NOT DENTISTRY ARE ONCOLOGY OR CARDIOLOGY NOT INFERTILITY AND CERTAINLY NOT OBSTETRICS. AFTER MENTIONING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE THE BILL USES THE WORD ABORTION AND ABORTION CARE NO FEWER THAN EIGHTEEN TIMES. WHO WILL ADMINISTER THESE ABORTIONS IS THE EMPHASIS ON SKILLED PHYSICIANS GIVING PROFESSIONAL AND COMPASSIONATE CARE NO. THE ONLY STUDENTS TO GET GRANTS MUST AGREE TO PERFORM ABORTIONS. AB NINETEEN EIGHTEEN SPECIFIES THAT SCHOLARSHIPS ARE NOT BASED ON MERIT STUDENTS MUST SPEND AT LEAST TWO CRITERIA FROM A LIST OF ALL OBSCURE CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDING UNDERSERVED AREAS HOMELESSNESS MENTAL IMPAIRMENT. HOW DO THESE QUALITIES BARE ON LEARNING OR PROVIDING ABORTIONS THEY DON'T. BY DIRECTING THESE LESSER TRAINED ABORTIONISTS TO RURAL UNDER SERVED AREAS AB NINETEEN IT WILL REDUCE THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR TARGETED WOMEN OF COLOR WHO LIVE THERE. WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOWARD IMPROVING CCESS TO HIGH QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN AND PROVIDING THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO GIVE THEM A REAL CHOICE NOT JUST INCREASE ACCESS TO SUB STANDARD ABORTIONS. THANK YOU AT THIS POINT WE'LL GO TO OTHERS IN EITHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION- PLEASE COME FOR TO THE MICROPHONE JUST YOUR NAME POSITION ON THE BILL AND ANY ORGANIZATION IF YOU REPRESENT ONE.

THIRTEEN SO HAS THIRTEEN VOTES THAT BILL WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO HIGHER EDUCATION AS WELL SO- MR SANTIAGO ARE YOU READY TO PRESENT. I KNOW YOU WILL NEED FOR TRANSMITTAL PERSON PURPOSES SO. YEAH OTHERS PRESENT MY BILL. AB TWO ZERO EIGHT ZERO BERMAN WHAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THIS COMMITTEE HAS INVESTED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE THE CONSUMERS RECEIVE AND REDUCE ITS COST WE HAVE HELD MANY HEARINGS ON COST CONTAINMENT. ACCESS CONSOLIDATION AND MORE. IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT SOMEONE INFAMOUSLY SAID. WHO KNEW HOW HEALTHCARE COULD BE SO COMPLICATED. HELLO WAS IT NOT MOST OF US HAVE KNOWN THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD FROM OPPONENTS WHO SAY THIS BILL IS TOO COMPLICATED BUT I SAY IT'S SIMPLE. CONSOLIDATION CONTINUES AND HEALTH CARE AND THE HEALTH CARE MARKET PLACE AND PRICES ARE NOT GOING DOWN. AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY'RE GOING UP. AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE OVERSIGHT IN GENERAL. AND MORE OVERSIGHT AND AUTHORITY IN CONSOLIDATIONS. OR INTO THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES. HEALTHCARE SPENDING INCREASED BY NINE POINT TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY. AND ALTHOUGH THAT GROWTH WAS DUE IN PART TO THE COBIT PANDEMIC NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING IS PROJECTED TO GROW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT 4% THAN THE ANNUAL GROWTH OF FOUR POINT 2% FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. HEALTHCARE IS GROWING AT TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE. THE BILL PROHIBITS SIX TYPES OF ANTI COMPETITIVE CONTRACT PROVISIONS AS AGREED TO IN THE SETTLEMENT BETWEEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SUTTER HEALTH. IT BUYS PROHIBITIONS NOT ONLY TO HOSPITALS BUT ALSO THE HEALTH PLANS INSURERS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. THIS WILL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AS THESE GROUPS NEGOTIATE AMONG THEMSELVES ON PAYMENT RATES. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE PROHIBITED TYPES OF CONTRACT CLAUSES IS ALL IS AN ALL OR NOTHING CLAUSE. SOME HOSPITALS REFUSED TO ALLOW A PLAN TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT WITHOUT ALL OF THE HOSPITALS IN THE PLANT EVEN AS SOME HOSPITALS ARE FAR OUTSIDE THE AREA THE PLAN OPERATES IN. THIS ALL OR NOTHING REQUIREMENT INCREASES THE PLANS COSTS AND THEREFORE INCREASES COST TO CONSUMERS. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS BILL EXTENDS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S EXISTING AUTHORITY TO REVIEW NONPROFIT HOSPITAL SALES AND MERGERS TO FOR PROFIT HOSPITALS. INCLUDE HEALTH PLANS AND MEDICAL PRACTICES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD FROM OPPONENTS OF THIS PROVISION HOW ONEROUS AND UNFAIR IDEAS I SAY IS LONG OVERDUE. OKAY NOR CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY HEAVILY CONSOLIDATED. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CONSOLIDATION IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS THAT AN AVERAGE IMPATIENT PERSON CONSERVE INPATIENT PROCEDURES. TO BE NEARLY TWICE THAT IN NORTH AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THIS BILL MAKES CLEAR THAT TRANSACTIONS BY HEALTH PLANS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATE APPROPRIATE REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT. BECAUSE HEALTH EXPENDITURES ARE PROJECTED TO GROW ONE POINT ONE FOR SEPARATE SENT FASTER- POINTS FASTER ON AVERAGE 420-192-2820 EIGHT. OKAY COSTS ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE FROM FOUR POINT ONE TRILLION DOLLARS INTO ANY TWENTY. TWO SIX POINT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. THESE ARE STAGGERING NUMBERS AND CERTAINLY UNSUSTAINABLE FINALLY THE INDUSTRY ARGUES A CONSOLIDATION IMPROVES QUALITY BUT THERE'S NO LITERATURE. OTHER THAN INDUSTRY SPONSORED STUDIES THE SUPPORT THAT ASSERTION IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE. I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU HERE FOR MY WITNESSES BETH CAPELL WITH HEALTH ACCESS AND JERRY BURRELL. WITH PURCHASERS BUSINESS GROUP ON HEALTH. GOOD AFTERNOON A GERMAN WORD AND COMMITTEE- AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THIS AFTERNOON- I'M JERRY BURRELL. WITH PGH- BUT PRIOR TO JOINING PGH I MANAGE HEALTH BENEFITS AND PURCHASED HEALTH CARE FOR MCKESSON STANFORD AND SAFE WAY FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. HE J. H. IS A NON FOR PROFIT NOT FOR PROFIT COALITION OF EMPLOYERS AND PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND FAMILIES WITH THE MISSION OF IMPROVING QUALITY AND AFFORDABILITY AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AS YOU KNOW THE COST OF HEALTH THE COST FOR CALIFORNIANS COVERED BY PRIVATE HEALTH THE HEALTH PLANS ARE MUCH TOO HIGH AND CONTINUE TO INCREASE AT AN UNSUSTAINABLE RATE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE HIGH COSTS ARE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGH PRICES. NOT INCREASED USE OF SERVICES OR THE AGING OF THE POPULATION. HIGH PRICES ARE DUE LARGELY TO THE MARKET POWER OF LARGE HOSPITALS HEALTH SYSTEMS AND PROVIDER GROUPS. THE GAME THIS MARKET POWER BY CONSOLIDATING AND FOR SOME OF THEM ENGAGING IN ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES. WITH NO FOCUS ON QUALITY. AB TWENTY EIGHTY APPLY THE PRO CONSUMER PROVISIONS OF THE LANDMARK SUTTER SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY WIDE IN OTHER WORDS LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD BY APPLYING THE SAME RULES ALL HOSPITALS PROVIDER GROUPS. AND HEALTH PLANS BY PROHIBITING THE SPECIFIC ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIORS IN THE SETTLEMENT. THE BILL ALSO EXTENDS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S EXISTING OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER NONPROFIT HOSPITAL MERGERS TO ALL HEALTH SYSTEM TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO REVIEW THE IMPACT ON QUALITY COSTS AND ACCESS TO NEEDED SERVICES BOTH OF THESE ELEMENTS. OF THE BILL ARE ESSENTIAL TO GETTING COSTS UNDER CONTROL. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT HIGH PRICES FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES GIVEN BY INDUSTRY CON CONSOLIDATION AND ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYERS WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS HAS RESULTED IN LOWER WAGES FOR WORKERS AND SLOWER JOB GROWTH. IN OTHER WORDS THIS IS NOT JUST A HEALTH CARE BILL IT'S A WAGES AND WAGES AND JOB GROWTH BILL THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS CROWDING OUT THE REST OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND WE CANNOT LET THIS CONTINUE. WE NEED LEGISLATION THAT WILL MAKE HEALTH CARE MARKETS WORK THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO RESULT IN LOWER PRICES A STRONGER ECONOMY AND MORE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU. YES HELLO ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION. WE SUPPORT AB TWENTY EIGHTY BECAUSE AS WE KNOW FROM AN AMPLE ACADEMIC LITERATURE IN THIS DOCTOR WOULD JUST SAID. CONSOLIDATION DRIVES UP COSTS WITHOUT IMPROVING QUALITY AND THEY'RE EVEN STUDIES INDICATING THAT IT WILL WORSEN MORTALITY OR DEATH RATES REALLY THE WRONG DIRECTION. THE ONLY STUDIES THAT INDICATE DIFFERENTLY WERE FUNDED BY THE HOSPITAL INDUSTRY ITSELF. WE KNOW FROM THIRTY YEARS OF WORKING WITH ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF BOTH PARTIES. ON NONPROFIT HOSPITAL MERGERS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS USED THEIR AUTHORITY TO KEEP HOSPITALS OPEN TO PROTECT EMERGENCY ROOMS LABOR AND DELIVERY CARDIOLOGY REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES LGBT CUES. SERVICES ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE ALSO IMPOSED CONDITIONS TO PREVENT ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR INTO MODERATE POST CONSOLIDATION PRICE INCREASES. YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REVIEW MAKES BUSINESS DECISIONS MORE EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS NINETY DAYS WITH ONE FORTY FIVE DAY EXTENSION THAT'S PRETTY MODEST WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT'S INVOLVED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS THESE ARE ALL TRANSACTIONS THAT INVOLVE MORE THAN FIVE BUSINESSES WITH MORE THAN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS DOZENS INDEED HUNDREDS OF TRANSACTIONS HAVE PRECEDED ALL MOST OF THEM WITHOUT CONTROVERSY AND MOST WITH CONDITIONS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY. THE IMPORTANT THING THAT AB TWENTY EIGHTY DOES IS TO ASSURE THAT THERE ENFORCEABLE CONDITIONS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND TO PROTECT THE HEALTH CARE THAT'S BEING DELIVERED. IN THE COMMUNITY YOU WILL ALSO HEAR THAT SOMEHOW AB TWENTY EIGHTY UNWINDS MANAGED CARE ON DOES INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEMS. AGAIN NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH AN INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEM INVOLVES A HEALTH PLAN THAT'S TRUE WHETHER TO KAISER OR SUTTER OR SHARP. IT IS THESE HEALTH PLANS. THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT HEALTH ACCESS IS FOUGHT FOR DECADES TIMELY ACCESS NETWORK ADEQUACY RATE REVIEW FINANCIAL SOLVENCY. THOSE PROTECTIONS ARE THE ONES THAT WE HOLD DEAR AND THINK IMPORTANT AND WE SUBMIT TO YOU THAT IN PART WE HAVE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS TRYING TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THEM BY SAYING THEY DON'T NEED A MANAGED CARE PLAN AS PART OF THE DEAL. FOR THESE REASONS WERE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU- I'LL CALL UP ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO WITNESSES- THREE MINUTES EACH. THANK YOU I'M THE MARC ALMOND WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND WE'RE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL BECAUSE IT ELIMINATES THE VALUE OF MANAGED CARE NETWORKS. AND ALSO ELIMINATES THE BENEFITS OF COORDINATED CARE AND TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS. I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW AN INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HOSPITAL SYSTEM CAN TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS AND REACT TO- UNPRECEDENTED EVENTS. FIRST EXAMPLE IS- WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE PANDEMIC WE SAW THAT HOSPITAL SYSTEMS HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. WERE ABLE TO REACT QUICKLY TO- THE SURGE THAT WAS- EBBING AND FLOWING IN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES. I HAD MORE RESOURCES TO MOVE P. P. YEAR ROUND TO MOVE EQUIPMENT AROUND TO MOVE STAFF AROUND TO ADDRESS A WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN COMMUNITIES. ANOTHER VALUE OF INTEGRATED SYSTEMS IS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A SPECIALTY CARE. IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HAVE THAT SPECIALTY CARE. A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES- MATERNAL HEALTH CARE A MOTHER OF COURSE- HAVING A NORMAL PREGNANCY- IT'S BEST TO DELIVER- IN THE COMMUNITY AT THE AT THE LOCAL HOSPITAL OR OTHER- LOCATION NEARBY. BUT IF THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS IF IT'S A HIGH RISK PREGNANCY. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN HAVING ARRANGEMENTS PREDETERMINED KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO GO- FOR SPECIALTY CARE AT TO A HOSPITAL WITH HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICES- WE KNOW THAT- ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SPECIALTY CARE WE KNOW THAT THE MORE A RARE OR VERY COMPLICATED PROCEDURE IS DONE IN ONE PLACE AT THE SAME HOSPITAL. BY THE SAME PHYSICIANS SURGEONS AND CARE TEAM THAT THE OUTCOMES ARE MUCH BETTER- FOR EXAMPLE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE WHERE PATIENTS ARE DIRECTED- THEY RECEIVE INCENTIVES TO GO THERE IN THE FORM OF LOWER COPAYS- THEY GET CARE FROM SURGEONS WHO DO THAT SORT OF TRANSPLANT ROUTINELY IN THE OUTCOMES ARE BETTER. FINALLY ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROVISIONS- EXTENDING THIS TO ALL THE SECTORS IN THE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY BEYOND- THE WORDS APPLIED NOW WE THINK. THERE SHOULD BE SOME DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS PUT IN PLACE- THE RULES OF EVIDENCE DON'T APPLY THE RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE DON'T APPLY AND WE KNOW THAT- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION TO IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON THESE TERMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WILL OPEN IT UP TO THE TESTIMONY FROM FOLKS IN THE ROOM SUPPORT OR OPPOSE LIMITED TO NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL.

MISTER MASON THANK YOU- ADAM VICE CHAIR- STE WE'VE HAD A LITTLE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS- AND- AS THE FORMER VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND ALL THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN REGARDS TO COST CONTAINMENT TRY TO DRIVE DOWN THE PRICES OF HEALTH CARE WHICH ARE STILL CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET- I'M- YOU KNOW I'M I'M SINCERE IN MY SUPPORTER OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE DON AND THE EFFORTS WE'VE CONTINUED. TO DO- TAKING A LOOK AT THIS BILL IS A COUPLE CONCERNS- THAT I THAT I HAVE- ONE OF THEM ALL JUST TALK ABOUT LOCALLY- BACK IN MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW THAT THE- THE CHAIR THE AUTHOR KNOWS. MY DISTRICT PRETTY WELL- BUT- WE HAVE- FOR HOSPITALS IN MY DISTRICT BUT THREE OF THEM WITH ONE JUST OUTSIDE IN INDIO. A WE HAVE- JFK A DESERT REGIONAL I AND ALSO HIGH DESERT- HI I HAD AS A MEMORIAL HEALTH CARE DISTRICT WHICH IS HIGH DESERT A HOSPITAL. THAT HAS CONTRACTED WITH TENET AND THEY'VE CREATED THE DESERT CARE NETWORK THE THREE OF THEM- I KNOW THAT I HEARD THAT- CONSOLIDATION IS TO IS- THERE'S NO DATA TO SUPPORT THAT IT ISN'T GOOD BUT I CAN TELL YOU- THAT- AT LEAST ANECDOTALLY. FROM THE FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT THAT- IT HAS BEEN BETTER. FOR THEM THAT OUGHT TO ALSO BE FIT THERE'S SOME COMPETITION A BECAUSE- RIGHT NEAR THEM WE'VE ALSO THAT EISENHOWER SO WE'VE GOT SOME AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE THERE ISN'T ANY ANY COMPETITION WITH HAVING. IT'S ALL CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE NO COMPETITION PRICES. ON THE PRICES RISE BUT WHAT WHAT IMPACT WOULD THIS HAVE ON THAT. ON THAT TYPE OF AN ARRANGEMENT WHERE YOU HAVE ON TO HOSPITALS THAT OUR PUBLIC HOSPITALS THAT HAVE CONTRACTED- WITH A PRIVATE MY ENTITY YOU. AT LIKE TEN TO CREATE A AND IN. SYSTEM I WOULD CALL AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM. A WHAT IMPACT WOULD THAT WOULD THIS HAVE ON ON THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF THE OPPOSITION OR FOR THE AUTHOR WANTS TO. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A STAB AT IT IN ON THE NIGHT I THINK BETH WILL AS WELL- LOOK I THINK THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAPPEN OUT THERE AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IN MY OWN DISTRICT- WE ALMOST LOST A HOSPITAL COAST HOSPITAL. IN FORT BRAGG AND WERE IT NOT FOR ADVENTIST HEALTH STEPPING IN. YOU DO A MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT FOR THAT HOSPITAL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THAT HOSPITAL TODAY. I WOULD SAY THAT'S A GOOD ARRANGEMENT NO. EVIDENCE DOESN'T OWN THE HOSPITAL BUT IT IS AN OPERATING. AND YES. PROBABLY CALL THAT CONSOLIDATION. BY THE AS A CONSOLIDATION AND FOR THE BENEFIT. OF THE COMMUNITY THERE. I DO NOT UNDERGRADUATES. THAT NONE OF THIS BILL UNWINDS ANY EXISTING AGREEMENTS- BUT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK. MORE CLOSELY. WHY SHOULD A HOUSE WHITE WHY SHOULD A HOSPITAL SYSTEM HAS HOSPITALS IN. MULTIPLE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT MIGHT NOT BE CLOSE TOGETHER. ALL CONTRACT YOU GATHER FOR THE SAME EXACT RATE. THAT DOESN'T REFLECT. THOSE INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES THAT DOESN'T REFLECT THE COST OF NECESSARILY DOING BUSINESS THERE. WHAT IT DOES DO. IS MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE PRICES STAY HIGH AND I BELIEVE THAT'S ARTIFICIALLYHIGH. AND SO THIS WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE REVIEW PROCESS. LUBIS SCRUTINY AROUND THIS. SAY THIS COULD BE FAIR FOR CONSUMERS ARE NOT. AND THE- I DON'T KNOW IF THE IF THE OPPOSITION WANTS TO ADDRESS THAT ARE OFF YOU'VE GOT ANY THOUGHTS ON ON THAT- THE ADVANTAGE OF- HOSPITALS IN A LARGER SSTEM MEAN IF THEY'RE NOT GEOGRAPHICALLY NEXT TO EACH OTHER IS THAT THEY DO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO ALL THE HOSPITALS IN THAT SYSTEM CLINICAL EXPERTISE I OFTENTIMES ITS FINANCIAL RESOURCES A HOSPITAL THAT- WOULDN'T MAKE IT ON. ITS OWN CAN BE PART OF A LARGER SYSTEM AND CONTRACTING AND NETWORKING TOGETHER- IN A STATE THAT HAS HIGHLY LEVERAGED- PAYMENT PLANS AS WELL IS JUST A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY. IS ABLE TO- GET A FAIR RATE FOR PROVIDING CARE IN THE IN THE COMMUNITY BUT IF I IF I MIGHT AND AGAIN YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH MY AREA BUT- THE COMMUNITIES OF PALM SPRINGS- ARE VASTLY. IN THE COMMUNITIES OF JOSHUA TREE- AND TO THE RESPONDING- THEY ARE DIFFERENT AND SO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE NEGOTIATING A RICK- IT'S THE SAME RATE SAYING IT'S GONNA ALL NOTHING. OUT AND I AND BY JOSH SHOULD BE A IS A MUCH PLACE EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST FORTY MINUTES UP THE ROAD- WHY WOULD- BE A- FOR THE- COME UP THE BILL THE BILL- THE PROHIBITS WERE ALL HA. COULD BE AND ALL OF TO BE IN THE NAY AND DOESN'T THAT THE RATES HAVE TO BE THE SAME. SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE PARTIES COULD AGREE TO SAY YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE IN THE NETWORK YOU HAVE TO CONTRACT WITH US. BUT THEN THERE IS A SEPARATE NEGOTIATION ON WHAT THE SPECIFIC RATE IS THE BILL PROHIBITS- THE ABILITY TO KEEP ALL OF THE AFFILIATES TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE IT'S AN INTEGRATED COORDINATED NETWORK. SO THE ECONOMICS I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT THE DID THE ECONOMICS BECOME PROBLEMATIC THEN FOR LIKE A HOSPITAL LIKE JOSHUA TREE- WHERE IS A SMALL RURAL AREA WOULD BE- MAYBE IT WOULD WORK OUT MAYBE TEN IT WOULD DECIDE HEY IF IT'S NOT ALL OR NOTHING THEN WE WOULD HAVE DONE. THAN BUSINESS THERE THEY WOULD DECIDE TO BE ABLE TO- TO DROP THAT CONTRACT RIGHT IN AND WHAT WE SEE SOME GAMES WITH THESE HOSPITALS TO IS- THE PAIR THE HEALTH PLAN. THE INSURER CHOOSES A DIFFERENT HOSPITAL THEY FEEL LIKE THEY GOT A BETTER RATE. THAT MEANS ALL THE- PATIENTS IN THAT COMMUNITY ARE DRIVING PAST THEIR LOCAL HOSPITAL. GOING TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL THAT'S FARTHER AWAY THAT'S ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES THAT I- THAT I HAVE- AND I'M LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS I TRIED ACTUALLY FIND THIS IN THE LANGUAGE. OF THE BILL AND I'M SURE THAT IT'S THAT IT'S THERE BUT THIS IS ON PAGE THREE. AND ITS THE- THE BULLET OF THIRTEEN- TALKING ABOUT THE ATTORNEYTHE DISCRETION IT'S GIVEN TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IT SEEMS TO BE. A LOT LIKE SOME- THAT YOU'RE GIVING IT OFF A LOT OF POWER TO ONE INDIVIDUAL A TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THESE AND YOU KNOW I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT GIVING. THAT KIND OF POWER TO ONE OF ONE PERSON AND THE IN JUST THE LANGUAGE THAT'S THERE- WAS SAYING WHETHER OR NOT. WHETHER OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT- THAT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S THE IT AG DOESN'T HAVE ANY- ROAD BLOCKS IF YOU WILL- TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE- IS JUST YOUR COMPLETE. I'M AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO GO IN AND YOU DO THAT OF COURSE OF CORRUPTION AND OTHER THINGS CAN END UP HAPPENING. IS IS THERE ANY CONCERN ABOUT THAT- AT ALL TO TIGHTEN. UP BORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WE WILL BE WORKING WITH JUDICIARY ON THIS AS WELL- I THINK YOU MIGHT BE MESSY ATTORNEY GENERAL THEY MIGHT THINK THE LANGUAGE IS WEAKER THAN THEY WOULD LIKE QUITE FRANKLY- BUT- BUT- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. THAT THAT WILL BE AN ISSUE I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO WHY WE'RE HERE. WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF A SUTTER SETTLEMENTS. OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES. THAT'S SIGNIFICANT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT AND WHAT THAT DID. WAS THAT YOU HEALTHCARE COSTS BEING 50% HIGHER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR CONSUMERS AND THE CARE NECESSARILY ISN'T BETTER THAN IT IS IN YOUR AREA BUT IT IS WAY MORE EXPENSIVE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE MIGHT WITNESS SHE CAN ANSWER A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YEAH OF BETH BELL AS A GIRL FROM RIVERSIDE I DO KNOW PALM SPRINGS AND- PART OF YOUR DISTRICTS ARE. OF UP I WOULD NOTE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S DISCRETION IS ALWAYS BOUNDED BY THE COURTS AND IN FACT. IN A RECENT TRANSACTION INVOLVING HUNTINGTON AND CEDAR SIDE I THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION LITIGATED THEY THERE WERE THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT IT IT CAME TO A HAPPY PLACE BUT WE HAVE THIRTY YEARS. OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL GOING BACK TO DAN LUNDGREN A REPUBLICAN IS WE MAY RECALL- USING THIS AUTHORITY IN A WHAT I WOULD SAY WAS A RESPONSIBLE WAY ALWAYS SUBJECT TO REVIEW B THE COURTS AND SO THERE'S ALWAYS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR- A CORE DUMP IN AND SAY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS OVERSTEPPED THEIR BOUNDS AND- IN MY DEALINGS WITH ATTORNEYS GENERAL. OVER THESE DECADES THEY'RE VERY MINDFUL THAT THEY HAVE TO BE WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE LAW FIVE MILLION DOLLAR A NUMBER WHY WAS THAT WHY WAS FIVE MILLION- THRESHOLD THAT WAS CHOSEN WHY NOT TWENTY MILLION OR THIRTY MILLION OR TWO MILLION FOR THAT MATTER WHY FIVE FLIES FIVE MILLION THE- I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARGUED FOR LESS SO QUITE FRANKLY- I DO. THAT IS YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE KEY IS COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT THAT IS THE INAPPROPRIATE NUMBER I'M OPEN TO THAT- IF YOU'RE A IS CERTAINLY RID SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE MIGHT BE THERE MIGHT BE INDIVIDUAL PRACTITIONERS LOOKING AT. VERGE YOU KNOW. DOCTORS MERGING PRACTICES THOSE ARE LIKE NOT LIKELY TO BE HIT THAT THRESHOLD. WE'RE TRYING TO BE SENSITIVE TO PROVIDERS. BUT THESE ARE IN OF THESE THESE LARGE MERGERS ARE GONNA. THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER HIGHER THAN THAN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND DOT IF THERE'S A PROGRAM MORE PROBING NUMBER OF PEOPLE CAN MAKE A CASE FOR THAT WE ARE OPEN TO THAT I. I THINK PEOPLE KNOW MY DOORS OPEN WE WILL WE WILL ALWAYS TALK WITH THE OPPOSITION. BUT I DON'T LIKE IS WHEN PEOPLE TO SAY NO WE DON'T OFFER OFFER A REASON WHY OR- OR SOMETHING FOR US TO CONSIDER. OKAY WHAT MANAGER THAT'S THE ALL MY QUESTIONS I JUST TO MAKE ONE STATEMENT I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS- TODAY- ONE OUT OF MY AFFECTION FOR OF THE AUTHOR- I'VE GOT SOME DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT- THIS- THIS BILL AND IF IT WOULD BE OKAY AS THIS MOVE AS THIS BILL MOVES ON THROUGH THE PROCESS- IF WE CAN CONTINUE TO KEEP ENGAGING ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO HOW IT AFFECTS- A HEALTH CARE DELIVERY- IN IN IN REGIONS LIKE MINE ABSOLUTELY MY PLEASURE THANK YOU. MYTHAGO OCCURRED. I THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I TO HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS ON THIS BECAUSE OF MY RURAL COMMUNITIES- BUT I WANT TO STATE IS THAT IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT HOW MANY TIMES YOU GO OUT TO VISIT WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND HEALTH CARE IS THE NUMBER ONE QUESTION THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED ARE YOU GONNA GET THE RATES DOWN OR HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE SPECIALIZED MEDICINE THAT WE NEED THOSE ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT MANY OF US GET WITHIN THE RURAL COMMUNITIES AS PART OF THE NUMBER ONE. OF A TOPIC THAT COMES UP SO I THINK THIS IS A REALLY FAIR PLACE TO START I KNOW THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND I PLAN ON WORKING WITH YOU I MEAN WHO CAN SAY THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE% THERE'S NOT UNFAIR PROVIDE CONTRACTING HELLO AS WELL AS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE OVERSIGHT FOR HEALTH PLANS AND WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND SAY YOU'RE RIGHT THIS IS WRONG OR WAS GREAT AT WORKED ALL ALONG. BUT AGAIN I WILL CONTINUE TO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND- AS- SOME GOVERNMENT SAID LET'S KEEP WORKING ON IT THE ARTIST DESERVE IT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GIVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND TO PASS TO JUDICIARY I'LL GIVE GERMAN WOULD A MOMENT TO CLOSE IF YOU'D LIKE THANK YOU AND IT'S WHAT THE MEMBERS FOR THE QUESTIONS AND WE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND WE WILL ABSOLUTELY WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION THERE'S REASONABLE REASONABLE THINGS. THAT DON'T. LATELY UNDER THE INTENT OF THE BILL WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN TO THAT- BUT WE'RE ALSO WATCHING CLOSELY FOR POISON PILLS WE KNOW WE KNOW THAT GAME TOO- SO I WENT THANK YOU- JUST LET ME FINISH BY SAYING. THAT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT KEEPING HEALTH CARE COSTS DOWN. IS ABOUT KEEPING WAGES AND JOB GROWTH UP TOO MUCH FOR THEIR INSURANCE PREMIUMS THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO GIVE RAISES. RED JOBS. THIS IS IMPORTANT ON MANY LEVELS I CONTINUES ALWAYS TO MEET WITH AND WORK WITH OPPONENTS OF STAKEHOLDERS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS I'M WORKING ON AUTHORS AMENDS WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS AROUND. THE AGE APPROVAL PROCESS- AND YES WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO BUT IT'S IMPORTANT WE GET THIS DONE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AND THE MOTION TO PASS TO JUDICIARY. I WOULD I WOULD I WALDRON NO WATER NO FIGURE CURRY AGUIAR-CURRY AYE ARAMBULA. BIGELOW BIGELOW NO CARILLO. LAURA LAURA NO MAIENSCHEIN. MAYES MAYES AYE MCCARTY. NAZARIAN RIVAS. RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ AYE SANTIAGO SANTIAGO AYE GARCIA. RIGHT NOW IT'S FIVE TWO THREE. WE WILL HAVE SOME MORE FOLKS SAID IN LATER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL. MR SANTIAGO IS GOING TO BE PRESENTING ITEM THREE A. B. TWO TWO FOUR TWO. I THINK MISTER CHAIR HARPER- FOR LONG AS THE PRESENT THIS OUT BUT I ALSO WANNA THINK THIS COMMITTEE- AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE- FOR WORKING WITH THIS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS- AB TWENTY TO FORTY TWO WHICH WE CALL THE MENTAL A MENTAL HEALTH CARE COORDINATION ACT. WILL GO A LONG WAY STILL TOWARDS HELPING PEOPLE WERE ON HOUSE AT THE CURRENT TIME NOW BACK LAST YEAR YOU MIGHT RECALL THAT WE CARED A BILL LIKE THIS- ALONG WITH MY JOIN OTHERS LIKE MISTREATMENT THE TALK ABOUT CONSERVATIVE- WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW WE ENDED UP PULLING BACK BECAUSE WE FELT THAT THE AMENDMENT OF THE TIME WATER DOWN THE BILL SO MUCH THAT. THE CHIP. SUGGEST WE DO A HEARING ON IT. IN IN THE HEARING- WE DISCOVER THAT IT WAS BIGGER PROBLEMS IN THE COORDINATION OF CARE FOR A PERSON WHO IS HELD UNDER A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. NOT THE BIG ONE THE BIGGEST PLANS WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO COORDINATION- AND NO SERVICE UNDER TOWARD THAT PERSON SO EVEN IF. WE WENT DOWN THE PATH TO CHANGING A CONSERVATIVE DEFINITION THIS THERE WOULD BE A BIG PROBLEM AND I WANT TO LAY OUT WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO AND KIND OF THE SIMPLEST TERMS. NUMBER ONE IT WOULD IT WOULD REQUIRE A COURT A CARE COORDINATION. OF BOTH AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL AT DIFFERENT TIMES BUT THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD ASSEMBLY JAMES LEE. IT WOULD REPORT- WE ARE A REAPING MECHANISM. A FRAME WHICH WOULD REAP. THE DOLLARS USE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HOW. WHO HELPED AND BASED ON WHO HELPED. AND IT WOULD ALSO BE. THE M. H. S. A. DOT. WOULD BE. WELL TO PAY FOR IN BY. AMBLE AND HOLES. NOW IT. WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AT THE GOES A LONG WAYS. TOWARDS HELPING THOSE PEOPLE WHO WE HAVE. OVER THE YEARS. WHO FOR ONE REASON ANOTHER CAN'T GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED AND ARE PUTTING A HOLD- IN WHAT IT WOULD DO. AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU GOTTA ASK YOURSELF WHAT IS DUE TO THAT PERSON. THAT HAS TO BE A HEALTH COORDINATION PLAN. TO THAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL BEFORE THEY ARE RELEASED NOW WE'RE NOT ASKING THAT THEY BE HELD UNTIL THERE'S A PLAN WE'RE NOT ASKING THAT ANY A LOT LAWS BE CHANGED. FOR THE TO BE IN HELD ANY LONGER WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BUT WHAT TOLD. IS A- ACCORDING TO HEALTH PLAN MENTAL HEALTH CARE PLAN FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT THAT IS ALL INCOMPLETE BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES WHAT WE FIND OUT IS A PEOPLE ARE RELEASED AND THAT THERE'S NO PLAN I WANT TO GO THROUGH A COUPLE NUMBERS JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW IN IS. IN SOMETHING KIND OF MIGHT. WE ALSO ASKED FOR AN AUDIT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND IN TWENTY TWENTY THOSE ARE AUDIT RELEASED TO US THAT THE US STATE HONOR HONOR DID AND IT LOOKED AT- THE STATE IN A PIC ON L. A. COUNTY THAT FROM FROM BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN TO TWO THAT. NINETY GET THE- PEOPLE. WHO ARE PLACED ON SEVEN TWO HOUR. HAVE FIFTY PRIOR HOLD HIMSELF. INTERVIEWED IN WHAT WHAT WAS DONE ABOUT IT OUT OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX. THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WERE HELD MULTIPLE AMOUNT OF TIME. OUT OF THAT ADULT PEOPLE THAT WERE HELD TEN THOUSAND OF THOSE PEOPLE WILL HOLD OVER TEN TIMES EACH THAT MEANS THAT WE'VE INVESTED ALL THIS MONEY. WE HAVE ALL THESE. PROCEDURES OF ALL THESE HEALTHCARE SERVICE EVERYTHING WE PUT OUT THERE MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH BUT WHEN A PERSON IS HELD. THERE'S NOT COORDINATION PLAN FOR THEM. AND SO WHAT WE'RE ARGUING HERE IS THAT THERE THAT THERE HAS TO BE THOSE THREE THINGS THAT WE MENTIONED. BUT WHAT WE RESULTS IN IS A COORDINATED PLAN FOR THIS PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WHO IS BEING HELD SO THAT THEY HAVE THOSE- SO THAT THEY HAVE THE CARE THAT THEY NEED THAT COULD TRANSLATE A BUT IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS. WE CAN CONTINUE TO DISCUSS BUT MIGHT BE. A RESPECT FOR THE COMMITTEES I WOULD HANDLE. THE MISTREATMENT. CHAMPION WITH OVER NUMBER VIEW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M SURE LIKE THOSE OF US IN LOS ANGELES THAT MANY OF YOU. HEAR FROM CONSTITUENTS IN YOUR AREA ALL THE TIME. ABOUT THE FRUSTRATION OF SEEING PEOPLE WHO CLEARLY. HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING ON THE STREETS WHO ARE. SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL OR IN THE THROES OF SOME SORT OF CRISIS. SEEING THEM SOMETIMES WE AFTER WEEK YEAR AFTER YOU. SOMETIMES SEEING THE SAME PEOPLE DIED BECAUSE MANY OF THEM HAVE UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT THEY'RE UNABLE TO TREAT- OF ANY COULD SAY THAT THERE ON THE STREETS OUT OF CHOICE PEOPLE SOMETIMES WHO ARE. CLEARLY DELUSIONAL- SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL AND WHY IN A NATION THAT HAS THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE THAT WE CAN SEEM TO. A WAY TO HELP THESE. AND STAY. AND I AS WHO'S HAD TO IN. IN MY CLOSE FAMILY. I'M BE THIS WAS ALMOST GOOD TO ANYTHING OTHER WAS A SEER BY PAUL DISORDER. AS THEY ENTERED A IN BATTLE OF AND SENT TO A DOUBLE. THAT OUR FAMILIES A BILL. TO- AND WORK WITH THEM THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN STATE KNOW TWO INTO TO THIS TIME A POST GRADUATE COLLEGE BOTH WITH ADVANCED DEGREES ARE LOOKING VERY SUCCESSFUL LIVES BUT ONLY BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO OFFER THEM THAT KIND OF. CLOSE CONTACT AND HELP AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE SEE ON OUR STREETS DESERVE THAT EVERY MUCH IT JUST AS MUCH. THEY'RE ALL SOMEBODY'S CHILD THEY'RE ALL SOMEBODY SIBLING AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HELP THEM. THE FAILING HERE I WOULD LIKE INTO THIS THAT IT WHEN I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AND I LEFT MY TREATMENT MY HOSPITAL AFTER MY FIRST SURGERY I WAS GIVEN A VERY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOLLOW A PLAN THAT LASTED FOR YEARS. I WASN'T JUST WAS SENT HOME AFTER SURGERY AND SAID HEY GOOD LUCK WITH THIS LET US KNOW IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG. NO I WAS OFFERED A CONTINUAL CARE AFTERWARDS- THERE WAS A REGULARITY TO IT THERE WAS A COORDINATION BETWEEN CAREGIVERS BETWEEN AN ONCOLOGIST IN A PRIMARY POSITION A NUTRITIONAL LIST AND OTHER. DOCTORS A SURGEON AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND YET WE DON'T DO THAT FOR MENTAL ILLNESS BUT DON'T WE SAY THAT MENTAL ILLNESS IS AN ILLNESS JUST AS MUCH AS A PHYSICAL ILLNESS. IF WE HAVE THAT UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COORDINATE CARE AFTER THAT FIRST CONTACT WITH THAT MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUAL THEY SHOULDN'T BE HELD IN JUST SEND HOME THE SAME WAY THAT SOMEONE HAS HAD A HEART ATTACK WOULD NEVER. JUST BE SENT HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL WITHOUT A FOLLOW UP PLAN SO IF YOU WANT TO THINK OF IT IN SIMPLE TERMS THIS IS REQUIRING THAT KIND OF FOLLOW UP PLAN FOR SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS.WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW AMOUNTS TO NEXT TO NOTHING AND IT'S NOT WORKING AN ARCHITECT YOU ANSWER FED UP WITH IT AND IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE TOOK A BIGGER AND BOLDER STAFF AND I BELIEVE THAT SINCE THE BEGINNING. OF THAT STEP THANK YOU SO MUCH. VERY MUCH. WITNESS SUPPORT. THERE REGISTERED. MR SANTIAGO DO YOU HAVE PEOPLE TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT WITH YOU.

MISTER SALAS YOU HAVE- YOU BILLS BEFORE US YOU HAVE WON A CONSENT ASSUME YOU WANT TO BE THAT WHEN THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY GOOD IDEA ESPECIALLY OF PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH AN AYE WE NEED THREE WITH KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE A LONG AGENDA- MEMBERS ARE PROUD TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN FORTY WHICH UPDATES A MODERNIZES THE EXISTING SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER. IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM TO MEET CURRENT NEEDS OF STUDENT HEALTH RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ANYBODY TO HAVE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU.. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN FORTY HI MY NAME'S LISA EISENBERG I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BASED HEALTH ALLIANCE WE ARE REPRESENT TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE ACTIVE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND MANY MANY MORE- PROVIDERS AND SCHOOLS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN STARTING SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS I DON'T THINK I NEED TO MAKE THE CASE FOR WHY WE NEED SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES OR THE BENEFIT OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS I KNOW THIS COMMITTEE IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT. IF YOU WANT TO QUICKLY SHARE THAT THERE ARE THREE QUICK ASPECTS THAT MAKE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER SO EFFECTIVE. THEY DELIVER COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE THAT INCLUDES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. FOR THEIR TEAM BASED CARE APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. MANY EVEN PROVIDE DENTAL CARE AND VISION SERVICES. THE SECOND ONE IS THAT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE REALLY WELL POSITIONED TO HELP STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES COME BACK TO SCHOOLS FROM THE PANDEMIC SO MANY ARE PROVIDED COVERT COVER TESTING AND VACCINATIONS. AND HELPING STUDENTS CATCH UP ON ON MATT AND EXACERBATED HEALTH CARE NEEDS. AND SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS OUR PROVEN STRATEGY TO ADDRESS HEALTH AND EDUCATION EQUITY THEY PREDOMINATELY ARE LOCATED IN SCHOOLS WHERE A MAJORITY OF STUDENTS ARE LOW INCOME OR STUDENTS OF COLOR. SO I'M EIGHTY FIVE NINETEEN FORTY UPDATE OUR CURRENT PROGRAM IN STATUTE DEFINES SCHOOL MAKES A STRONG DEFINITION OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS AND REALLY ADAPTS THE GRANT CATEGORIES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CURRENT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER FIELD. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK OUT IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. MY NAME IS KATHLEEN JONES I'M THE DIRECTOR FOR MOUNTAIN RIGHT TO LIFE THE CALIFORNIA LICENSE MEDICAL FACILITY. I COULD NOT BE MORE IN FAVOR OF PROVIDING HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN ESPECIALLY THOSE IN RURAL AND UNDERSERVED AREAS. PROVIDING SUCH HEALTH SUPPORT THROUGH SCHOOLS MAKES GOOD SENSE AND IT'S VITAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES. IN MY JOB I SEE FIRSTHAND THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF HOMELESSNESS AND POVERTY ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN. IT'S OUR DUTY TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR NO ACCESS TO RESOURCES YOU AND I MUST STAND FOR THOSE IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE BUT ABORTION IS NOT ASSISTANCE AND A SOMEONE WHO IS CRIED WITH WOMEN WHO REGRET THEIR ABORTIONS MOMENTS AND YEARS LATER I CAN TELL YOU THAT PROVIDING SCHOOL BASED. SCHOOL BASED HEALTH. CENTER SUPPORT PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES ABORTION IS NOT THE KIND OF HEALTH CARE OUR CHILDREN NEED. AMICALE ABORTIONS ACCOUNT FOR THE MAJORITY OF ALL ABORTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES CURRENTLY INJURY FROM THESE CHEMICAL ABORTIONS INCLUDE HEAVY BLEEDING REQUIRING SURGERY AND SECTION SEPSIS PUBLIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE ENDOMETRIOSIS ANXIETY MENTAL DEPRESSION UP TO DEATH. AB NINETEEN FORTY WILL FACILITATE GIVEN THE SAME CHEMICAL ABORTION PILLS THE GRADE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS THROUGH THE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS. JUST LIKE SB TWENTY FOUR MANDATES CALIFORNIA PUBLIC COLLEGES. AND WORKING IN CONCERT. WITH THE PRO ABORTION LAWS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS AND THOSE BILLS CURRENTLY IN COMMITTEE AB NINETEEN FORTY IF PASSED WILL ENSURE THAT EVEN PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS LOCATED AT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS CAN GIVE CHEMICAL PORTION. THE TWO YEAR OLD. WITHOUT PARENTS KNOWLEDGE AND WITHOUT A DOCTOR'S DIRECT SUPERVISION. BUT WHAT IF A GIRL TAKES THE CHEMICAL WORSHAM TONE CHANGES HER MIND AND SHE GO BACK TO THE SCHOOL NURSE TO START A PROJECT FROM TREATMENT TO OFFSET THE MIFEPRISTONE. IS THAT INCLUDED IN THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE ABORTION PILL REVERSAL WHICH IS THE PROGESTERONE TREATMENT EVEN THOUGH IT'S A LIFESAVING TREATMENT FOR THE BABY AND POSSESSES NO RISK TO THE MOTHER SO WHO DECIDES WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CARE. POLITICIANS OR THE PARENTS FOR THESE REASONS I ASK YOU TO OPPOSE AB NINETEEN FORTY UNLESS AMENDED TO REMOVE THE PHRASE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE BILL. HELLO MY NAME IS ELIZABETH RANGEL AND THE YOUNGEST OF TWELVE CHILDREN I'M A UNITED STATES VETERAN I HAVE SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES AIRFORCE RESERVES. AND WORKED AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRECTIONAL OFFICER FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS. I'M A CURRENTLY A CHILDREN'S PASTOR AND I OVERSEE A CHILDREN'S MINISTRY AT MY CHURCH. I'M A PROUD GRANDPARENT OF TEN GRANDCHILDREN. WITH AB NINETEEN FORTY CALIFORNIA'S DOING SOMETHING IT HAS NEVER DONE BEFORE. I PROVIDING DIRECT STATE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS. YOU CAN HELP SUPPORT GENERATIONS OF CHILDREN ESPECIALLY IN UNDERSERVED AREAS WITH ACCESS TO A NURSE. AND A LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE. AB NINETEEN FORTY GOES BEYOND HEALTH CARE TO ENABLE ABORTION THROUGH THE SCHOOLS. BEHIND THE BACKS OF PARENTS DESTROYING THE CHILD AND PARENT BOND. ABORTION LEAVES EMOTIONAL AND SOMETIMES PHYSICAL SCARS IN THIS CHILD ON CHILDREN I KNOW I HAVE THREE LIVING CHILDREN AND I'VE HAD FOR ABORTIONS. SO I'M READILY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS AND THE DEVASTATING REGRET AND SHAME. I HAVE SUFFERED FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS ABORTION HURTS. I KNOW MANY MOTHERS HAVE HAD ABORTIONS AND SOME WERE NEVER ABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN. SOME OF THEM WERE LED ON A POWERFUL DRUG ADDICTIONS ALCOHOLISM SUICIDE. AND REGRET ISRAEL AND CAN LAST A LIFETIME. AS A SIDEWALK COUNSELOR I HAVE PERSONALLY WITNESSED SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS BRING IN YOUNG GIRLS. AS YOUNG AS TWELVE YEARS OLD FOR ABORTIONS AT THE PORTION CLINICS. THEY'RE YOUNG AND THEY ARE NAIVE AND SCARED TO TELL THEIR PARENTS. I PERSONALLY WALK SIDE BY SIDE WITH SOME OF THESE YOUNG MOMS. THAT WERE AFRAID I HAVE WATCHED THESE SCENARIOS PLAY OUT. I HAVE PICTURES OF THESE BABIES AND THEIR MOMS AND THEY'RE ALL VERY THANKFUL. SOMEONE WAS THERE TO GUIDE THEM IN THE RIGHT PATH. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A STRONG PRO LIFE ADVOCATE. NOT SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES ABORTION TO THE ANSWER. AS WOMEN WE ARE NOT PROMISE CHILDREN. TEACHERS AND SCHOOL NURSES SHOULDN'T BE ABORTION ADVOCATES. BUT THAT'S WHAT AB NINETEEN FORTY WILL DO. THE BILL CHANGES THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO AUTHORIZE THESE NEW SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS TO PROVIDE PRIMARY MEDICAL CARE. THAT INCLUDES REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH MOBILE HEALTH INTEL AND TELEHEALTH FOR TELEHEALTH. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES IS A CODE FOR ABORTION THAT MEANS. AB NINETEEN FORTY WILL DIRECT STATE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS. TO PROVIDE ABORTION SERVICES TO CHILDREN ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. THROUGH THE STATE THE NEXT STEP WILL BE TO PROVIDE ABORTION PILLS TO GROUP TO GRADE SCHOOLS. AND HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES THROUGH THE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS. BECAUSE THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE MINISTRY. THE NEW SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAM UNDER AB NINETEEN FORTY. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN WILL ALSO BE IN CHARGE OF PROVIDING CHEMICAL AND SURGICAL ABORTION SERVICES. TO THE SCHOOLS AND CAMPUSES. AS A PARENT AND A GRANDPARENT MYSELF I CAN SAY PARENTS WANT TO KNOW THEIR CHILDREN ARE SAFE WHEN THEY'RE AT SCHOOL. NOT CHORUS INTO MAKING A LIFE DECISION WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS KNOWLEDGE. I'M TALKING ABOUT OUR CHILDREN. YOUR CHILDREN PLEASE AMEND AB NINETEEN FORTY TO REMOVE THE DIVISIVE ISSUE OF ABORTION FUNDING IN OUR SCHOOLS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO GOOD OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION JUST YOUR NAME POSITION ON THE BILL AND ANY ORGANIZATION IF YOU REPRESENT ONE.

THIS IS WHAT I GOT. I GOT HIS THERE'S NO ONE THAT YOU KNOW AND THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF SERVICE AS MUCH AS THEY USED TO AND I JUST. THINK IN THIS TIME IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE EMBRACE OUR CHILDREN. AND- I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS BILL BUT I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GOOD. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOUR CURRY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS IT WAS SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS MAKE SURE THAT KIDS THAT NEED EYEGLASSES ARE GETTING EYEGLASSES KIDS THAT NEED MENTAL HEALTH ARE GETTING MENTAL HEALTH. IT'S A NEED ANY TYPE OF SERVICES THERE'S A PLACE TO DO IT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE DONE THIS ON THEIR OWN THROUGH THEIR- ACE. WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO PROVIDE THIS MECHANISM FOR ALL SCHOOLS I THAT FOR. CHILDREN RESPECT TO THE OPPOSITION. WAS THAT'S GIVEN TESTIMONY BELIEVE IT'S- BASE THERE'S NO. SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER THAT'S OFFERING ANY ABORTION SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. SO I BELIEVE IT'S OFF BASE AND I BELIEVE DOES NOT PERTAIN TO THIS BILL WE'RE REALLY JUST TRYING TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR CHILDREN I THINK THAT'S WHY.

I'M LIKE TO START WITH THE SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN IS THAT OKAY MADNESS OKAY THANK YOU WITH EVERY READY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN. IMMODEST BELL TO IMPROVE THE CALIFORNI IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY. WHICH IS AN EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE TOOL. IMMUNIZATION INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE CONFIDENTIAL POPULATION BASED COMPUTERIZED DATABASES THAT RECORD MMUNIZATION DOSES GIVEN BY PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS IMMUNIZATION INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE BENEFICIAL BECAUSE THEY DETERMINED VACCINATION STATUS TO A DECISIONS MADE BY CLINICIANS HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SCHOOLS GUIDE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSES TO OUTBREAKS OF VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASES. AND FORM ASSESSMENT OF VACCINATION COVERAGE MISSED VACCINATION OPPORTUNITIES INVALID DOSE ADMINISTRATION AND DISPARITIES IN VACCINATION BECAUSE- THEY ALSO FACILITATE VACCINE MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY ALSO KNOWN AS CAR. CAME INTO EXISTENCE OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO AND WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES. THE SYSTEM BEGAN WITH MANY DIFFERENT INDEPENDENT COUNTY BASED SYSTEMS AND WE HAVE SINCE BEEN UPGRADED TO BECOME A MORE CENTRALIZED STATEWIDE DATABASE. TO DATE EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA IS A PART OF THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM EXCEPT SAN JOAQUIN. WHO CURRENTLY HAS ITS OWN IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY CURRENTLY ABOUT UNDER THE AGE OF SIX HAVE TWO OR MORE IMMUNIZATIONS RECORDED IN THE SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM IS OUTLINED IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE ONE TWO ZERO FOUR FOUR ZERO AND LAYS OUT THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR REPORTING THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY AND TO WHOM CERTAIN INFORMATION THE REGISTRY MAY BE READ DISCLOSED. THE EXISTING LAW ALSO ALLOWS THE IMMUNIZATION INFORMATION TO BE SHARED WITH THE IMMUNIZATION ALSO ALLOWS IT IMMUNIZATION INFORMATION TO BE SHARED WITH THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY AS LONG AS THE PARENT. OR PATIENT IS INFORMED ABOUT THE REGISTRY. INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO LOCK THEIR RECORD SO THAT IT IS NOT SHARED WITH ANY OTHER CARE USER. ONLY THEIR PHYSICIAN WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THAT IMMUNIZATION INFORMATION. THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY STATUES SHORTS STRICT CONFIDENTIALITY AND DOES NOT VIOLATE HIPPA GUIDELINES AND AGREEMENT. TO PARTICIPATE IN THE IN THE CARE SYSTEM THE PROVIDER USER MUST SIGN A CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND VIEWING OF PATIENT RECORDS ARE TRACK TO MAINTAIN AN AUDIT TRAIL. IT IS CONFIDENTIAL AND IT IS SAFE. PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. IS TO ALLOW KERR'S ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE ACCURACY OF IMMUNIZATION RATE DEPENDS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF TIMELY ACCURATE AND COMPLETE INFORMATION PERTAINING TO VACCINATIONS RECEIVED BY MEMBERS OF A POPULATION. CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA NOT ALL IMMUNIZATION PROVIDERS ARE RECORDING THE IMMUNIZATIONS THEY GIVE. THE INFORMATION IS ONLY AS COMPLETE AS THE INFORMATION THAT IS PLACED AND BY THE IMMUNIZATION PROVIDERS. AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN WILL ONLY CHANGE THREE SIMPLE THINGS TO THE EXISTING REGISTRY. ONE IT WOULD REQUIRE ALL VACCINE PROVIDERS TO RECORD THE INFORMATION INTO THE REGISTRY TO BOLSTER COMPLETE AND ACCURATE DATA. TWO IT REQUIRES THE COLLECTION OF RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA ACCURATELY TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY AND RECOGNIZE DISPARITIES. AND THREE A. CLARIFIES THE SCHOOLS CAN ACCESS VACCINATION STATUS DURING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES TO AID AND STUDENT SAFETY. AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION COALITION PROTECT US SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SUPPORTED BY THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS. CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PEDIATRICIAN PHYSICIANS CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES ASSOCIATION LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SACRAMENTO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND TEENS FOR VACCINATIONS INCORPORATED. WITH ME TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IS KATHERINE FLORES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION COALITION AND SUSAN PARN DOLLAR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR NURSING AND WELLNESS FROM SANTA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WOULD AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATHERINE FLORES MARTIN I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION COALITION AND WE'VE WORKED FOR YEARS WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE STRONG AND EFFECTIVE LAWS. THAT RESULTED IN PROTECTING MILLIONS OF CHILDREN TEENS AND ADULTS. THIS BILL MAKES SEVERAL CHANGES A DOCTOR WEBER TO SAID IN THE END UPDATES THE SYSTEM AND HELP ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA'S BETTER PREPARED TO OUR NEXT PUBLIC HEALTH. AGENCY AND WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THE UPDATES WILL REQUIRE A START WEBER SAID HEALTH PRACTITIONERS TO ENSURE THAT THE DATA ON THE VACCINES THEY ADMINISTER WILL BE RECORDED IN THE REGISTRY WILL. CASES PATIENTS REYES THE CITY BE RECORDED THIS FIELD IS ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM IT WOULD JUST REQUIRE THAT THE THAT THE BE RECALL THAT BE CHECKED- ALONG WITH AUTHORIZING SCHOOLS TO DATE ON ALL VACCINES RELATED TO SCHOOL SAFETY AGAIN ENSURING THAT WE'RE PREPARED FOR THE NEXT EVENT- THE CALIFORNIA REGISTRY IS A SECURE CONFIDENTIAL SYSTEM USED BY DOCTORS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS INCLUDING PHARMACIES AN OPTOMETRIST THOSE WERE REQUIRED. OR AUTHORIZED TO GET VACCINES SO THAT ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS CAN GET THE VACCINES THEY NEED AT THE RIGHT TIME- THE LEGISLATURE FIRST AUTHORIZED REGISTRY NINETY EIGHT AND SINCE THAT TIME MILLIONS OF. DOSES HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN THE REGISTRY AND IT'S BEEN AN INTEGRAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK. FOR HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS TO FORECAST WHAT CHILDREN NEED BEFORE THEY START SCHOOL FOR PHARMACISTS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP UP ADULT UP TO DATE ON THEIR IMMUNIZATIONS. AND OTHER AUTHORIZED USERS THIS BILL LIKE SCHOOLS TO DOCUMENT VACCINES FOR TO BE ABLE TO KEEP TRACK OF VACCINES. AS OF SUBSUMING MEMBER WEBER SAID THAT CONSOLIDATES THE WRECKED. FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES INTO ONE SINGLE RECORD FORECAST WHAT IMMUNIZATIONS ARE DO TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT SINCE WE DO HAVE A LOT OF VACCINES NOW. MANAGES A VACCINE INVENTORY OFFICES REALLY LIKE THIS MEDICAL ASSISTANTS AND MANAGERS THAT USE THESE SYSTEMS LOVE THE SYSTEM. ASSIST PROVIDERS WITH CONDUCTING REMINDER RECALL REMINDING PARENTS TO GET THEIR- FLU SHOT. AND PRODUCES A VARIETY OF PATIENT SPECIFIC AN AGGREGATE REPORTS. AUTHORIZE USERS INCLUDE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SCHOOLS HAVE READ ONLY ALONG WITH CHILD CARE FACILITIES HEALTH CARE PLANS AND FOSTER CARE AGENCIES. AS WE SAID USERS ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS AND UNDERGO REQUIRED TRAINING BEFORE THEY CAN USE THE SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM WAS ALREADY IN PLACE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC THIS PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM HAS BEEN DILIGENTLY ACCOMPLISHING IMPORTANT WORK TO SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS. ONCE COVERED NINETEEN VACCINES BECAME AVAILABLE AVAILABLE THE SYSTEM GREW TO BECOME EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT TO OUR PANDEMIC RESPONSE EFFORTS. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO ALL OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE WORKED TO ENSURE ITS CONTINUED SUCCESS. IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY USED TO REGISTRY FOR DECADES THEY'RE HAPPY WITH THE SYSTEM AND THEY ARE SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SUSAN BARTON DOLLAR AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NURSING AND WELLNESS AT THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I COME TO YOU WITH THIRTY YEARS EXPERIENCE AS A NURSE. TWENTY OF THOSE AS A SCHOOL NURSE IN SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IS THE SECOND LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA WE SERVE STUDENT POPULATION OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS AT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX SCHOOLS OUR STUDENT POPULATION CONSISTS OF NEARLY 45% OF STUDENTS WHO ARE LATINO TWENTY THREE POINTS PERCENT ARE WHITE. EIGHT POINT PER WHO IDENTIFIED. THIS 73% WHO ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND NINE POINT 7% WHO ARE ASIAN. NEARLY FOR FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH MEALS. AS A SCHOOL DISTRICT THE PANDEMIC HAS DEMONSTRATED AND NEED FOR INFORMATION TO EFFECTIVELY SERVE STUDENTS AND TO DO IT WITH EQUITY. AT SAN DIEGO UNIFIED WE DEFINE EQUITY AS PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT AND HOW THEY NEED IT. AS A SCHOOL DISTRICT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE FACE IN HELPING OUR MOST IMPACTED STUDENTS IS KNOWING WHO HAS ACCESS TO A VACCINE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHO DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A FAX SEEKING. ACCESS TO THE REGISTRY IS CRITICAL FOR US TO ASSESS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR SCHOOLS IN TO ENSURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS REMAIN OPEN EVEN DURING A PANDEMIC. ACCESS TO THE REGISTRY WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE SPECIFIC SCHOOLS THAT NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH ACCESS TO VACCINES. ACCESS TO THE REGISTRY DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WILL ALSO REMOVE THE BURDEN ON PARENTS AND THEY'RE VERY BUSY SCHEDULES. TO COMMUNICATE WITH SCHOOLS WHEN THEIR CHILD HAS BEEN VACCINATED. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL SIMPLY BE ABLE TO CHECK THE REGISTRY ON A REGULAR BASIS TO CONFIRM A STUDENT HAS BEEN VACCINATED. THIS WILL ALSO BE CRITICALFOR HOMELESS FOSTER CARING YOUTH AND MAY NOT ALWAYS BE AWARE OF THE NEED TO INFORM THEIR SCHOOL ABOUT A VACCINE OR ACCESS TO A VACCINE. FOR THESE REASONS SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IS A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN. AND THANKS ASSEMBLY REMEMBER WEBER WELL THAT WAS EASY TO SAY FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS PROPOSAL. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU AE VOTE AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ARE THEIR OPPOSITION WITNESS. HI MY NAME'S KRISTINA HILDEBRAND FROM A VOICE FOR TRADE ADVOCACY I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE STAR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. OUT WILEY WE AGREED THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BE MADE TO THE CALIFORNIA MINIMIZATION REGISTRY THIS BILL DOESN'T ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. HONESTLY THE REGISTRIES AMASSED. AMONG CHILDREN THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DUPLICATION OF RECORDS WITH A HUNDRED AND 7% OF ZERO TO FIVE YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA HAVING VACCINE RECORDS IN THE DATABASE. WE ALSO THAT THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE AMEND THE BILL TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES SO THAT THE DATA AND THE REGISTRIES IS ACCURATE. THE REMAINDER OF OUR CONCERNS REVOLVE AROUND PRIVACY WHICH WE ARE THANKFUL CALIFORNIA TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY. CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY CLAIMS TO BE AN OPT OUT REGISTRY. BUT IT ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE LOCKING OF DATA. CURRENTLY NOT ALL DOCTORS OR VACCINE PROVIDERS INPUT VACCINES INTO THE REGISTRIES. IF THEY DO THEY MUST DISCLOSE THAT THEY ARE DOING SO TO PATIENTS PARENTS AND GUARDIANS BUT THEY PEOPLE CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO STOP THE INPUTTING IF THEY DISAGREE. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE ALL ACCINE PROVIDERS TO ENTER OR VACCINES. WE RECEIVED NUMEROUS CONCERNED COLES AND EMAILS FROM UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES AND THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED FOR THE PRIVACY OF OUR MEDIC. THE AUTHOR SHOULD ALSO. SEND THAT THIS MAY REDUCE THE VACCINES. THAT AMONG THESE GROUPS. WE ALSO THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE AMEND THE REGISTRY TO BE OPT IN. WHERE PATIENTS PARENTS AND GUARDIANS CAN DECIDE IF THE RECORDS ARE PUT INTO THE REGISTRIES AT THE TIME OF VACCINATION. THERE'S ALSO DISCONNECT REGARDING ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE BILL SPECIFICALLY REGARDING WHAT SCHOOLS AND OTHER ENTITIES WILL BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD AND A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. IF THAT IS A LARGE DOWNLOADS OF COMMUNITY DATA TO WHICH WERE OPPOSED OR JUST VACCINES RELATED TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ON AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT ADULT CLIENT BASIS WE ALSO THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE TO DEFINE IMMUNIZATION STATUS ASSESSMENTS. TO REFLECT THE LATTER WE ALSO ALSO THAT THE AUTHOR ENSURES THAT HIPAA AND POP FOLLOW THE MEDICAL RECORDS ONCE THERE ARE ACCESS BY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS.

THE VACCINE AND MANDATE IS THE LAW IN IN CALIFORNIA MY GUESS IS THE REASON WHY THERE'S OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IS BECAUSE THERE'S FOLKS THAT DON'T WANT THEIR NAME TO BE IN A REGISTRY BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T GOT THEIR VACCINATIONS THAT'S MY GUESS THAT'S PROBABLY WHY. MY PUBLIC EMAIL ACCOUNT GOT BANNED- OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS BUT SURE ALL OF YOU GOT THOSE IS AS WELL I'M NOT GOT AND THEN- WHO VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE- HEY I UNDERSTAND IT- AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S A VERY STE. THAT YOU HAVE. A BUT IS LAW IN CALIFORNIA- AND- IT'S UP. IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR- THAT OUR CHILD CARE CENTERS. AND OTHERS KNOW THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE THE KIDS THAT ARE GOING- ARE ARE VACCINATED YET AND THEN THERE THERE IS THAT. OF THAT DATA- YEAH I'VE GOT. A THREE AND A HALF ALMOST FOUR MONTH. OLD AND GONE THROUGH THE FIRST SET OF AXE IS AND GET IT READY IF. VERY TO BE ABLE TO GO FOR THE- NEXT SET OF VACCINES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION SO THAT WHEN SHE GETS READY TO GO. TO SCHOOL THAT. IT'SALL ALIGNED. THE ONE. THE BILL TODAY- BUT- IN REGARDS TO THE QUESTION TO BE ABLE TO LOCK- THAT HE SAID TO TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT TALK ABOUT THE PRIVACY OF IT- AND THE PURPOSE ALLOWING. BE ABLE TO BLOCK. DATA SO I'LL I WILL LET MY- ONE OF MY WAY SPEAKING AND I'LL SPEAK FROM A PHYSICIAN'S RIGHT SO THERE THE SYSTEM HAVE WE HAVE A WEBSITE THAT PARENTS. TO HAVE. NOT SHARED WITH OTHERS- THE DATA STILL AVAILABLE TO THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUT NO OTHER SEAT YOU THE USUALLY PEOPLE WANT THEIR OWN DOCTOR TO BE ABLE TO SEE THEIR- IF. THE LAW FOR THE- NOT TO BE SEEN BY THE PERHAPS OR ANOTHER DOCTOR WE FOUND IN THE PAST THE MOST PARENTS MAY HAVE CONCERNED IF ANY PARENT AND IS A SMALL NUMBER IF THEY HAVE CONCERNS IN A LOCKET THEN THEY REALIZE IT'S NOT SHARED WITH PEOPLE THEY NEEDED HAVE. BUT YOU. THE FORMER SOMEONE POCKET BE THE PURPOSE OF IN THAT JUST LIKE SOME OF US DON'T STROLLER DATE WHEN WE UP FOR OR WHEN WE- SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO. MAYBE ARE THEY FEEL. STRONGLY ABOUT. THIRTY SERVICE THE ABOUT PRIVACY IS. MAYBE DON'T UNDER THAT IT. IT IS JUST THEIR CHILD'S IMMUNIZATION HISTORY THERE'S NO OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY THEY MAY NOT MAY NOT REALIZE THAT IT'S JUST THEIR IMMUNIZATION JUST I WOULD GIVE. CHILD CARD THAT'S WHAT REGISTRY TO HELP THE SPACE THAT DATA. IN A ONE. RESOURCE THAT. AFTER THIS ONE QUICK STORY NOW WE A LONG LONG- BUT I DO THINK IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS- AND DID YOU. COOLEY FOR ME IN MY TO COUNTY RIVERSIDE IN SAN BENITO COUNTY- WE DO HAVE THAT AND I CHANGE FROM ONE HEALTH PLAN TO THE OTHER HEALTH ABOUT ONCE. AND I STEPPED ON A- SANDALS ON WENT THROUGH THE SANDAL INTO MY FOOT- AND MY WIFE SAID YOU'RE GOING TO THE DOCTOR TO GO GET- A WIN OF LAST TETANUS SHOT COULDN'T REMEMBER. SOME I GOT MY SHOT I GO PLAN AND TURNS OUT THAT EVEN WITH THE NEW HEALTH PROVIDER BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE'VE GOT. COUNTY THAT THEY HAD RECORD IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE A TEN YEARS AND THANKFULLY I WAS ABLE TO GET. A TECHNICIAN OUT DIDN'T HAVE TO GO GET ONE BUT WHEN MY- WHEN MY BABY WAS BEING BORN- SO YOU WERE DOUBTS. THANKFULLY THEY HAVE HEARD OF THAT I THINK IT MAKES. FOR A TO HAVE A- PLACE WHERE. THAT DAY. TO THE- SAYS. BUT THAT HAVE GOING TITERS IN SORT OF. FIGURE OUT WHICH IS MUSICIANS YOU HAPPY DON'T HAVE SO AGAIN I'M SO. OF THIS. THANK MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY. THIS AGUIAR-CURRY THING THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR NUMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FOR REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN HAVING ALL THAT INFORMATION IN ONE PLACE. AND I THINK IN THE SAME WAY AT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MACE'S JUST SAID IS THAT. IN CHILDREN MYSELF IF I WOULD MAKE IT MORE BECAUSE I CAN'T REMEMBER ONE DAY FROM THE NEXT TO WHERE I. FOR MY INFORMATION'S GONE TOO. FAR TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I'VE TAKEN SO STRONG AS TO HAVE IT ALL IN ONE PLACE. BUT ALWAYS REMIND MYSELF WHAT MY JOB IS ABOUT. WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE ASK YOU WHAT YOUR- THAT FIFTY. WHAT STREET WROTE POLICE FIRE THE PUBLIC SAFETY IS A BIG PIECE OF IT AND SO THIS IS A- ALMOST. THAT THINK YEAH. THE WHAT. IS IT DID YOU. SURE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR N. AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I BUT I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION- AND SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO. HAVE A- THE XIN ABOUT THIS OUT HAVING EITHER SIDE BE UPSET WITH YOU. WHEN YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO DERIVE THE DATA AND INFORMATION- BUT- WHAT I'M JUST. WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH THE ANALYSIS AND SPEAKING ALSO TO MY STAFF WHEN I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WAS. HOW MANY SCHOOLS WERE NOT PROVIDING THE VACCINE INFORMATION NECESSARY THAT REQUIRES US. TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN PLACE THAT THE REQUIRES INFORMATION INFORMATION TO BE GATHERED. UP TO WHAT BUT I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS WHAT'S BEEN THE ISSUES WITH COMPLIANCE THAT'S REQUIRING US TO DO THIS BILL. RIGHT SO THIS BILL MANY MANY PROVIDERS ALREADY USE THE REGISTRY THE MAJORITY PROVIDERS USE REGISTRY WE HAVE SO MANY MORE NEW PROVIDERS THAT ARE. ALSO USED IN REGISTERING OUTLAW WHAT MORE AWARENESS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ADULT IMMUNIZATION FOR EXAMPLE IT'S A LIFESPAN REGISTRY SO IN A BUT PRIMARILY AT FIRST WE WERE FOCUSING ON CHILDREN BUT MILLION. INTO DOSES OF GONE IN SINCE COVERT VACCINES BECOME AVAILABLE. AND THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL PROVIDERS ARE USING IT I'D HAVE TO ONE ALSO SURE THAT MAJORITY OF DATE. WAS SHARED BY TWO MILITANTS WERE LINKED WITH. ELECTRONIC HEALTH WE HAVE A GREAT STAFF AT CDPH TONS OF FOLKS WORKING ON MAKING PERMITS IT SEEMS THIS. THE CARE PROVIDERS GET THAT DATA THE ROOT STREET SO WE WANT TO GO THE EXTRA MILE NOW TO GET THOSE. OTHER PROVIDERS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN USING THE REGISTRY FOR WHATEVER REASON AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE. DOES THAT HELP ANSWER THAT'S ONE OF THEM SHOT THE OTHER PART IS MAKING SURE THAT SCHOOLS. ARE FINANCED OUT THAT- THE SCHOOLS HAVE ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT VACCINES CHILDREN HAVE. IT THEY CAN SEE THE REQUIRED SCHOOL DOCUMENTS VACCINATIONS RIGHT NOW BUT IN IN SOME. THE PUBLIC HEALTH. ME NEED TO BE. SOME GOOD. YEAH I THINK I AM CHILDREN MOVE IN CHILDREN A LOT AND BEFORE I CAN WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN I MEAN IS REGISTRY OR A SCHOOL WOULD COLLECTED THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN REGISTRY THEIR OWN DATABASE WITHIN THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT N. AND THEN THEY WOULD MOVE AND ALL F THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE LOST MILITARY IF GOOD DAY OF THAT YOU KNOW WHICH THAT WHERE DID PUT THAT RECORD. BEFORE I MOVED HERE FROM STATE WHERE IS IT I GET PERMISSION AND SO I THINK THAT. HAVING IT ALL IN ONE PLACE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE EVERYBODY FROM CALIFORNIA CAN GO LOOK AT THAT ONE SPOT JUST MAKE SO MUCH MORE SENSE IT JUST GETS RID OF ALL THAT FOR. BUT YOU HAVE DATA TO WHAT- IF THERE'S BEEN A CHALLENGE OR HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO QUANTIFY WHAT'S NOT BEING REPORTED THAT IS POSING A PROBLEM TO NECESSITATE THIS. WE NEED TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL PROVIDERS ARE ACCESSING THE SYSTEM TO PUT IN THE IMMUNIZATION DATA TO KNOW WHERE OUR POPULATIONS THAT- WE KNOW IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE WHOLE POPULATION. AND I KNOW WHO YEAH GO AHEAD. SO I THINK- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU KNOW BETTER YOU DO BETTER RIGHT AND SO. WE YOU KNOW. TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO EVEN MORE WHEN I STARTED- AS A PHYSICIAN WE WERE RIDING ON CHART. RIGHT AND- THE ISSUE WAS DO WE UNDERSTAND EVERYBODY'S HAND WRITING OR WITH A LOSS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THEN WE SLOWLY STARTED SWITCHING OVER TO ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS REMEMBER WE DID CERNER AND CHICAGO WHEN I WAS AT COOK COUNTY AND THEN. WE'VE ALL SWITCHED OVER TO A DIFFERENT METHOD NOW BECAUSE WE KNOW BETTER WE DO BETTER AND MOST PHYSICIANS. ARE USING SOME KIND OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY RARE FOR YOU TO GO INTO A DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND HAVE SOMEBODY ACTUALLY. WRITING DOWN AND YOU SEE YOUR CHART RIGHT THERE ANYMORE I THINK THE SAME THING ABOUT IMMUNIZATION- YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT IT IS- BETTER FOR THE- PATIENTS BETTER FOR THE PARENTS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT LIKE WHERE IS THAT YELLOW CARD I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS ASKED FOR A YELLOW CARD WHEN I HAVE TO HAVE YOUR CARD. I WAS CAN'T. BE ABLE TO ONE PLACE IF YOU MOVE IF YOU NEED TO VERIFY IT FOR YOUR SCHOOL THAT YOUR CHILD HAS BEEN IMMUNIZED YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AND- HOBBIES OR FIND SOMETHING- YOU KNOW A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA ONCE I GOT THE- YELLOW FEVER BACK. TO THE LIFETIME THING I LOST MY YELLOW CARD NEXT TIME I WAS GOING I HAD TO GET IT AGAIN. SO. YOU BETTER AND THIS IS A- OF DOING BETTER BE WE KNOW THE- IMMUNIZATION REGISTRIES HAVE WORKED AT THE CONFIDENTIAL- AND- SO IF SOMEONE. DOESN'T WANT THEIR INFORMATION SHARED THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A CHAIRED. BUT THIS IS JUST EXPANDING IT SO THAT WHEN THAT NEXT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS COMMS. WE HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE. WE'RE DOING AS MUCH AS WE CAN FOR OUR RESIDENTS TO MAKE THEIR LIVES EASIER. AND SO THIS IS WHY IT NEEDED TO BE EXPANDED. BUT THERE'S NO SPECIFIC. DATA OR ISSUE I WOULD. SO AT THIS WE HAVE A LONG MEETING I DON'T WANNA GO ON BUT I DO WANT TO JUST. AT MY OWN BY CONCERN IS WE ALSO HAVE AN IMPERFECT SYSTEM. ANNA OUR IMPERFECT SYSTEM IS FRAUGHT WITH VULNERABILITIES AND WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITH INFORMATION BEING LEAKED OUT UNFORTUNATELY WHEN IT WAS UNINTENDED- SO I AM. I'M I'M QUITE HONESTLY OF TWO MINDS AYE AYE AYE THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT ME SUPPORTING UNIONIZATION BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE WE WORK AROUND THE EDGES TOO MUCH ON ISSUE AREAS THAT WE MAY RATHER WAIT TO SEE CHALLENGE FIRST BROUGHT. RATHER THAN SOMETHING TO CREATE A PERFECT SYSTEM WHEN- AGAIN WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH A LOT OF IMPERFECTIONS AND- THE WAY WE HANDLE A LOT OF THINGS. AS WAS EVIDENCED DURING THIS LAST PANDEMIC- SO. WELL I THINK ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE SYSTEM LIKE I SAID IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND SO HOW MANY- DATA BREACHES HAVE. THE REGISTRY HAVE OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. ZERO OKAY. IT'S AN EXCELLENT SYSTEM M. THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE IS INVESTED WELL IN THIS IN THIS PROJECT FOR SURE I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS BACK AND GET THEM ANSWERED BY- YOUR TECHNICAL STAFF AT THE CDPH BECAUSE- THEY HAVE. A WONDERFULLY TALENTED TEAM THERE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE WORKING HARD FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND YOU SHOULD ALL BE VERY PROUD OF THEM. LET THE OPPOSITION A QUESTION IF THAT'S OKAY MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO ON TO GIVE MORE LIGHT TO YOUR ON SITE AND THE MAJORITY OF LARGE ORGANIZATIONS OR ALL OR LARGE ORGANIZATIONS ARE KAISER UCSF ALL OF THEM WILL GREENS IS THE CARAMELIZATION TREE CURRENTLY WHO DOESN'T USE IT A MOSTLY INDEPENDENT OUR DOCTORS BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE TRAINING IT DOES TAKE EXTRA SOFTWARE- AND TIME AND AN EFFORT- BUT THOSE DOCTORS STILL KEEP ELECTRONIC RECORDS. I THINK FOR US YOU KNOW ONE OF THE KEY PIECES HERE IS THE LOCKING OF THE DATA YOU CAN LOCK IT BUT THE DATA STILL REMAINS THERE AND SO OUR CONCERN REALLY IS- THE FACT THAT ONCE EVERY DOCTOR IS REQUIRED OR HIM FOR IN THAT DATABASE IT MEANS THAT THE IF YOU'RE UNDOCUMENTED OR YOU DON'T WANT YOUR INFO IN A GOVERNMENT DATABASE IT'S GOING TO BE A THERE. I THINK NUMBER. CHOOSE THE WERE NOT IN SYSTEM THE WOULD CHOOSE TO OPT IN OR NOT HAVE THEIR INFORMATION PUT IN THERE IS VERY SMALL BUT THE SCHOOLS WOULD STILL FOR THOSE PARENTS THAT YOU KNOW OUR ARE. WHAT YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID ONE THREE MINUTE STATION RECORDS IN ONE PLACE TO ACCESS THEM THE BE ABLE TO DO THAT SIR YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL ASKING FOR THE SMALL POPULATION OF UNDOCUMENTED. PEOPLE OVERHEAD IT WAS. IT WAS WIDELY KNOWN WIDELY. ENCOURAGED THAT UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA GOT VACCINATED THOSE PEOPLE WILL HAVE THEIR INFORMATION PUT INTO THAT DATABASE AND THEY'RE REALLY CONSENT AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT THEIR PRIVACY. THANK YOU. JUST TO THAT POINT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A PHYSICIAN YOUR INFORMATION IS PUT INTO SOME KIND OF COMPUTERIZED DATABASE AT THIS WHETHER YOUR- DOCUMENTED OR UNDOCUMENTED. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. THE NONE- WE DON'T HAVE A MOTION AFTER SOME OF. THE MOTION NOW ARE DEAD MOTION AND THIS BY MISTAKE OR CURRY SECOND BY MR MAYES TO PASS TO EDUCATION- I CLOSER TREVOR YES THANK YOU- SO THIS BILL UPDATES ARE ALREADY EXIST ALREADY EXISTING IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY I CANNOT. EMPHASIZE THAT ENOUGH ALREADY EXISTING. IT DOES NOT VIOLATE HIPAA LAWS NOR DOES IT REMOVE A PATIENT OR PARENTS RIGHT TO DECLINE HAVING THEIR INFORMATION LOCKED FROM BEING ACCESSED FROM ANY OTHER OF THE USERS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ALBUM PASS RECOMMENDATION- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

IT IS ZERO THREE ZERO WHERE- YEAH OUR OUR OUR GROUP IS SHRINKING AS WE SPEAK HERE SO- BUT- PLEASE GO AHEAD AND PRESENT YOUR NEXT BILL AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR. HEY I AM HERE TO PRESENT MY LAST BILL BEFORE YOU ARE TODAY. AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR CALIFORNIA ABORTION AND REPRODUCTIVE EQUITY ACT ALSO KNOWN AS THE CARE ACT. THIS BILL ENSURES ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTIVE SERVICES ARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL PATIENTS AND TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SAFETY NET PROVIDERS FOR THESE SERVICES. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE AND I DEFINITELY ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS LEADER IN PROTECTING AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO ACCESS ABORTION AND WHILE THESE EFFORTS HAVE HELPED TO MAINTAIN THIS RIGHT FOR DECADES THERE ARE STILL NUMEROUS REMAINING BARRIERS TO ACCESSING CARE INCLUDING COST. TO ADDRESS THESE BARRIERS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA OFFER UNCOMPENSATED CARE THE PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD THIS COST OF SERVICES. PATIENTS MAY BE IN THIS SITUATION BECAUSE OF INCOME AND PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS OR BECAUSE THEY LACK COVERAGE FOR ABORTION AND ABORTION RELATED REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED DUE TO GAPS IN THEIR PERSONAL COVERAGE DUE TO RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION OR SELF INSURED EMPLOYEE. INSURANCE REGULATED BY FEDERAL LAW. IN ADDITION TO THE COST BARRIER THIS YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN OVER FIVE HUNDRED ABORTION RESTRICTIONS PROPOSED IN OVER FORTY STATES. AND SIX STATES HAVE ALREADY ENACTED ABORTION BANS. THIS IS FORCING PEOPLE TO TRAVEL FROM THEIR HOME STATE FOR AN ABORTION. CALIFORNIANS PROVIDERS ARE ALREADY SERVING PATIENTS FROM THE STATE'S AND EXPECT TO SEE UP TO ONE POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE TRAVELING TO CALIFORNIA FOR CARE. AS ADDITIONAL STATES AN ACTOR HOSPITAL LAWS AND THE SUPREME COURT RULED IN A CASE THAT WILL LIKELY OVERTURN ROE VERSUS WADE. AS A REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE WE MUST URGENTLY ADDRESS AND SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF THE PROVIDERS WHO OFFER THIS CARE TO ENSURE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO SERVE PATIENTS WHO ARE RELYING ON THEM FOR THIS VERY CRITICAL SERVICE. AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR ESTABLISHES THE REPRODUCTIVE CALIFORNIA REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH EQUITY PROGRAM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION. TO PROVIDE GRANT FUNDING TO CALIFORNIANS SAFETY NET PROVIDERS OF ABORTION AND COUNTRY TO SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD ALSO CREATE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SELF INSURED EMPLOYERS WHO DO NOT PROVIDE ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION TO NOTIFY THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS OF WHAT BENEFITS ARE NOT COVERED AND THAT THEY CAN ACCESS THESE BENEFITS THROUGH THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH EQUITY PROGRAM. AMENDMENTS ALSO ENSURE THAT THE BILL DOES NOT INFRINGE UPON THE RIGHTS OF EXEMPTED RELIGIOUS AFFILIATED EMPLOYERS. WITH ME TODAY. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR IS MOLLY ROBSON LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA. AND STACY WHAT A ROCK FOR OFF ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL AT THE PACK IS ALSO HERE FOR ANY. QUESTIONS WE- HAVE. THE CALIFORNIA SORRY IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE I'VE BEEN UP HERE I'M PEAPACK REPRESENTS THE SEVEN PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES IN THE STATE WHO OPERATE OVER A HUNDRED HEALTH CENTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ALONGSIDE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA FROM THE FUTURE OF ABORTION COUNSEL IN THE FALL OF LAST YEAR TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO ABORTION AND DECREASE BARRIERS TO CARE. AND WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES TO REDUCE COST BARRIERS TO ABORTION THEY'RE STILL INDIVIDUALS UNABLE TO AFFORD THE COST OF SERVICE. ABORTION AS YOU KNOW IS A TIME SENSITIVE AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE SERVICE AND BARRIERS TO ABORTION CAN CAUSE PEOPLE TO BE FORCED TO CARRY AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY OR PUSHED INTO A LEADER JUST STATION CREATING. MORE BARRIERS. TO ADDRESS THESE BARRIERS A SAFETY NET PROVIDERS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD OFFER UNCOMPENSATED CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY. ON AVERAGE PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE OFFERED ABOUT MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE ANNUALLY TO PATIENTS. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT WHEN ROSE OVERTURNED WHICH IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN BY JUNE OF THIS YEAR ONE POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE FIND THE CLOSEST. WRITER IN CALIFORNIA. AS WE PREPARE TO SEE THESE PATIENTS SEEKING ABORTION SERVICES AND OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IN OUR STATE. IT IS CRITICAL THAT- OR IT IS SORRY WE EXPECT TO SEE MORE PATIENTS UNABLE TO AFFORD THE COST OF SERVICES AS THEIR INELIGIBLE FOR STATE PROGRAMS. AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR WILL CREATE A GRANT PROGRAM FOR ABORTION PROVIDERS WHO OFFER UNCOMPENSATED CARE TO PATIENTS. ENSURING THAT PROVIDERS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD CAN CONTINUE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE CARE TO ANYONE WHO WALKS IN THE CENTER DOOR. IN FRONT OF YOU YOU HAVE RECEIVED WRITTEN TESTIMONY FROM DR JANET JACOBSON THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD ORANGE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES. I'D LIKE TO READ JUST A PIECE OF HER TESTIMONY FOR YOU. RECENTLY I PROVIDED CARE FOR TWO PATIENTS ONE FROM BARSTOW CALIFORNIA AND ONE FROM DALLAS TEXAS. THE VISION FROM BARSTOW TRAVELED ON A BUS WITH HER KIDS TO OUR CLINIC AND SAMPOERNA DINO FOR CARE. SHE COULD NOT GET AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE CARE SHE NEEDED IN BARSTOW AND HOW TO TAKE A DAY OFF OF WORK. ADDITIONALLY SHE CANNOT AFFORD CHILD CARE AND DID NOT QUALIFY FOR. MEDICAL PROGRAM. THE OTHER PATIENT WHO TRAVEL TO GET CARE FROM TEXAS LEFT HER KIDS WITH HER SISTER IN DALLAS. AND FLEW TO CALIFORNIA WITH NO CLOTHES NO FOOD AND NO MONEY. WHAT THAT TEXAS PATIENT DID HAVE WAS AN APPOINTMENT AT P. P. O. S. B. C. WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE HER CARE AND A SISTER WITH ARRANGING TRANSPORTATION. MEALS AND ACCOMMODATIONS. BOTH THESE PATIENTS WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEEDED EVEN THOUGH THEY COULD NOT PAY. PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S MOD. IS CARE NO MATTER. AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR INSURERS PROVIDERS. CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PATIENTS EQUITABLY. REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. FOR THESE-REASONS WERE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU- I'M JUST HERE FOR QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW HAS SOMETHING BUT I THOUGHT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. MY NAME IS KATHLEEN JONES FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS I'VE BEEN THE CEO FOR MOUNTAIN RIGHT TO LIFE PREGNANCY CENTER A RELIGIOUS NONPROFIT CALIFORNIA CORPORATION. THAT I WAS A GLOBAL EMPLOYEE MANAGER. OR TRUCKING AND LOGISTICS COMPANY BASED HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH OFFICES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTH AMERICA. AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR CREATES A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH EQUITY FUND WITH MONEY FROM TAXPAYERS AND PRIVATE DONORS. MY COMPANIES FOCUS IS SERVING UNDERSERVED WOMEN AND FAMILIES BUT WE NEED NOT APPLY FOR GRANT BECAUSE WE CHOOSE TO OFFER. ENDS WE'LL GO TO THE WASHROOM PROVIDERS ONLY LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AS AN EMPLOYER I'M ALREADY FORCED TO PAY FOR STATE FUNDED ABORTION INDIRECTLY THROUGH BUSINESS TAXES. THIS BILL BILL DOES VIOLATE MY RELIGIOUS BELIEFS I HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHAT INSURANCE BENEFITS WILL PROVIDE TO MY EMPLOYEES. AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR IGNORE SAID I. THE SUPREME COURT IS ALREADY TOLD CALIFORNIA THAT CANNOT FORCE OR FORCE ME TO TELL EMPLOYEES ABOUT OPTIONS THAT AYE OPPOSE BECAUSE TO DO SO VIOLATES MY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS AS AN EMPLOYER. THAT CASE WAS NOT FOR THE SERRA. SO NOW IN THE END RUN AROUND THE SUPREME COURT'S AND TRAMPLING OVER MY RIGHTS AS A CALIFORNIA EMPLOYER. TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR. OTHER COMPANIES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO TELL MY EMPLOYEES NOTHING. SOMETHING I WON'T PAY FOR THAT INTERFERES WITH THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP. THIS SAID ABOUT FUNDING ABORTION THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DON'T FORCE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO TALK ABOUT GETTING COVERAGE FOR OTHER HEALTH RISKS LIKE DIABETES OR HEART DISEASE WEIGHT LOSS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE WELL WOMAN CARE CHILDBIRTH SO HIS WHO IS PUSHING ABORTION. BY TARGETING RELIGIOUS EMPLOYERS LIKE MYSELF AND COMPELLING PROFESSIONAL SPEECH THAT GOES AGAINST MY RELIGIOUS TENETS CONCERNING ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR VIOLATES MY RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES PROTECTED BY THE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR IS DISCRIMINATORY AND PUSHES A RADICAL ABORTION AGENDA IT INTERFERES WITH EMPLOYERS RIGHTS AND VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND SHOULD BE REJECTED BY THIS COMMITTEE. FOR THOSE REASONS I'M ASKING FOR A NO VOTE ON AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR. NEXT WITNESS WITH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR WOULD AN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE I NAME IS KATHLEEN DOMINGO I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF PRIVATE NONPROFIT SOCIAL SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA IN OUR NATION AND THE WORLD EVERY DAY CATHOLIC MEN AND WOMEN PRIESTS AND SISTERS SERVE THE POOREST OF THE POOR IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD IN CALIFORNIA. WE PROVIDE HOUSING TO THOSE WHO LIVE ON THE STREETS THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM ADDICTION WE WELCOME IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES WITHOUT QUESTION PROVIDE HOUSING LEGAL SERVICES JOB PLACEMENT AND CASE MANAGEMENT. WE PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES TO THOSE IN OUTLYING AREAS AND IN INNER CITIES. WE WALK WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. FIVE IN THE STATE. PORTABLE HOUSING IS OUT OF REACH FOR SO MANY. I AM HERE TODAY TO OPPOSE AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR. CONTRARY TO THE AUTHOR'S ASSURANCES THIS BILL DOES NOT PROTECT RELIGIOUS EMPLOYERS PRACTICING MINISTRY TO ALL PEOPLE. THE AUTHORS AND SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL KNOW THAT IF THE EFFECT THAT IT WILL HAVE ON THE MINISTRY'S OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS CHRISTIANS HAVE PRACTICED OUR FAITH BY SERVING THOSE IN NEED. OUR FAITH IS NOT CONFINED TO THE INSIDE OF OUR CHURCHES. OUR MINISTRY SERVE ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO IS IN NEED. THIS TOPIC OF ASSIGNING DEFINITIONS TO RELIGIOUS EMPLOYERS HAS BEEN LITIGATED AGAIN AND AGAIN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IF PASSED AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR WOULD FORCE OUR MINISTRIES TO CLOSE. INSTEAD OF SERVING THE POOR AND HOUSING THE HOMELESS AND CARING FOR THE ELDERLY HE WOULD RATHER. DOORS FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS ABORTION HAS BEEN THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC IN AMERICAN POLITICAL LIFE. CREATING REFS IN POLITICAL PARTIES COMPANIES AND FAMILIES. HOLDING SHOWS THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DO NOT WANT THEIR TAX DOLLARS USED FOR ABORTIONS. AND AMERICANS ARE DIVIDED FIFTY FIFTY ON ABORTION'S LEGALITY. AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR DOES NOT PROVIDE TRUE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE WHEN OUR COMMUNITY ORGANIZER IS GO INTO THE HOMES OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES FAMILIES AND POVERTY BE FAMILY SAY. WE CANNOT SURVIVE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY SAY WE'RE PUTTING OFF HAVING CHILDREN FOR NOT HAVING THE CHILDREN THAT WE WANT. TO HAVE BEEN AND WE'RE NOT. GETTING FOR WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO GIVE BIRTH. WHICH IS THE PARENT WHO NEED THE TO AFFORD THE COST THE PRENATAL CARE UNTIL AS A MIDWIFE. ALL OF THAT COMES OUT OF. NO SIMPLE. PAY FOR BIRTH AS THERE IS ABORTION. NOT ONLY WOULD AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR CHANNEL TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO ABORTION BUT NOT HELP WOMEN WHO WISH TO BECOME PARENTS IT WOULD ALSO CLOSE THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF SERVICES TO WOMEN CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WOULD WOMEN IN FAMILIES TURN IF THEY WANTED TO HAVE CHILDREN AND GROW THEIR FAMILIES. ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA WOMEN AND FAMILIES AND EMPLOYERS OF FAITH I URGE A NO VOTE TODAY ON AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FOUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE ARE OTHER WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM.

CALIFORNIA HAS LONG RISEN TO THE OCCASION AND OFTEN LEAD THE WAY TO FIGHT FOR HEALTH EQUITY. IT SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT WHEN IT COMES TO ABORTION AND THE SAFETY NET PROVIDER TO PERFORM THE SERVICES. THE CARE ACT CONTINUES CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO BEING A REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE. INTERNATIONAL LEADER IN SAFEGUARDING AND ADVANCING REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE.

THE SECULAR KERR. OKAY WE'RE DOING ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN A. B. TWO FIVE ONE SIX ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUILAR KERRY. JUST GIVE ME A SECOND WE'RE GETTING OUR- OF THE I GUESS IS A LONG LINE OUT THERE MAYBE. MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES FIRST MY THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK. AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTEEN WOULD REQUIRE ALL HEALTH PLANS TO COVER HPV VACCINE WITHOUT ANY COST SHARING STATUS ADDITIONALLY IT WOULD MAKE HPV VACCINE A COVERED BENEFIT IN THE FAMILY PLANNING ACCESS CARE AND TREATMENT AND TREATMENT KNOWN AS FAMILY PACKED. MEDI CAL PROGRAM. HPV IS THE MOST COMMON SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION IN THE UNITED STATES. THERE ARE MULTIPLE TYPES OF HPV THAT CAN LEAD TO DIFFERENT HEALTH PROBLEMS THE MOST SEVERE WHICH ARE CERVICAL AND OTHER TYPES OF CANCERS. ACCORDING THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION MORE THAN THIRTY SIX THOUSAND NEW CANCER DIAGNOSIS EACH YEAR CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO R. E. V. INFECTION. IF KERN HP VACCINATION RECOMMENDATIONS WERE FOLLOWED THE CDC ESTIMATES AROUND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND OF THESE CANCERS COULD BE AVOIDED. AND WHILE MOST HEALTH INSURERS OFFER COVERAGE FOR THE HPV VACCINE AS A PRO PREVENTATIVE SERVICE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. SOME REQUIRE PATIENTS TO COVER SOME OR PART OF THE COST WHICH CAN BE UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER DOSE. ADDITIONALLY NOT ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO QUALIFY FOR FAMILY PACK WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FULL SCOPE INSURANCE. ONLY PACKED IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY COVERED ANY VACCINES SO MAKING THE HPV VACCINE A COVERED BENEFIT WILL MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THOSE WHO WISH TO BE VACCINATED WELL THEY'RE ALREADY IN THE PROVIDER LOCATION. FOR OTHER HEALTH SERVICES AVOIDING THE DELAYS TO THIS CRITICAL PREVENTABLE CARE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY TODAY'S DR SARAH KENNEDY CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER. MEDICAL OFFICE. HELLO AND LEGISLATIVE CAN MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU AND FOR HEARING THIS TESTIMONY I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO BE HERE MY NAME IS DR SARAH KENNEDY I'M AN OBSTETRICIAN AND GYNECOLOGIST- ON AS LISTED ON THE C. O. O. CMO OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I WHICH REPRESENTS SEVENTEEN HEALTH CENTERS THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RANGING FROM URBAN SAN FRANCISCO AND SUBURBAN BAY AREA AND UP TO THE OREGON BORDER SEVERE PEARL CENTERS. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT AS AN OBSTETRICIAN AND GYNECOLOGIST A CERVICAL CANCER IS ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING DISEASES THAT I CARE FOR IT IS A HORRIFIC DISEASE- LARGELY TARGETING REPRODUCTIVE FEMALE BODIED PATIENTS ON LEADING USUALLY TO VERY PAINFUL DEATH. ON THIS HORRIBLE DISEASE IS ACTUALLY ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE BY THE HPV VACCINE WHICH HAS BEEN. IF AN EFFECT AND MANY COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH VACCINE UPTAKE HPV VACCINE UPTAKE ARE ACTUALLY NEARING EXTINCTION OF CERVICAL CANCER IF YOU CAN IMAGINE SO AUSTRALIA WILL HAVE NO CERVICAL CANCER CASES BY TWENTY TWENTY EACH BECAUSE OF THE HPV VACCINE. I THE ISSUE WE FACE TODAY IS ONE OF HEALTH EQUITY SO WILD WHITER RICHER INSURED PATIENTS HAVE READY ACCESS TO HPV VACCINE. FAMILY PACKED PATIENTS DO NOT. AN APPROXIMATELY 40% OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD PATIENTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE COVERED BY FAMILY POTS AND THESE PATIENTS DO NOT HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE HPV VACCINE. THIS MEANS THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR LOW INCOME PATIENTS PATIENTS STRUGGLING TO OBTAIN HEALTH CARE ACCESS DISPROPORTIONATELY. AND EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCIA. OF CERVICAL CANCER- ORAL PHARYNGEAL CANCER AND GENITAL WARTS ALL OUTCOMES OF HPV. SO I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT- OF THE HPV VACCINE COVERAGE BY FAMILY PATHS AND ACROSS ALL INSURERS- AS THIS IS BOTH A HEALTH EQUITY ISSUE AND AN ISSUE THAT WE ALL FACE AND THAT WE WOULD WANT OUR SISTERS OUR MOTHERS OUR DAUGHTERS ARE AND- TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT. THIS TERRIBLE DISEASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK I WAS ACTUALLY WITNESSES IN ANYBODY IN THE CHAMBER IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION SORRY. HEAD OF MYSELF THERE.

W.'S AND PROMONTORIES ARE TRUSTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND HELP ADDRESS MONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS PREVENTED OF HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND HEALTH RELATED SOCIAL NEEDS. FROM A TAURUS YOU USUALLY LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY SERVE THEY SHARE THE NEIGHBORS OF THIS THIS TO THE LANGUAGE SOCIAL NOT ECONOMIC STATUS AND LIFE EXPERIENCES. BECAUSE OF THAT THEY HAVE THE UNIQUE ABILITY TO BRING INFORMATION WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED SPECIFICALLY TO WHERE PATIENTS LIVE. EAT PLAY WORK AND WORSHIP. THIS YEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PLANTS TO MAKE SEA HW'S AND PROMONTORIES A COVERED BENEFIT FOR ALL SIXTEEN MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THE FUND THIS EFFORT. THIS IS WHY AB TWENTY SIX NINETY SEVEN IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE IS ABLE TO REVIEW THE SUCCESS OF C. H. W.'S IN THE PROPER TORRANCE. WHILE IN A ADVOCATES TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN SUPPORT THE ONGOING NEEDS A MEDIC CAL ENROLLEES. LOCAL WORKFORCE THESE DH CS IMPLEMENTS THE NEW BENEFIT. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS ANDREA RIVERA SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS AND TAYLOR REFERENCE. PROGRAM COORDINATOR WITH THE HEALTH EDUCATION COUNCIL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY% NAME IS ANDREA RIVERA AND I'M THE SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK THE PLAN IS A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY SIX NINETY SEVEN. CALIFORNIANS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS OR PROMOTE PRODUCTS AND ENSURE THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF THE C. H. W. WORKFORCE. AB TWENTY SIX NINETY SEVEN IS FOCUSED ON THREE KEY GOALS. ONE CODIFY ASPECTS OF THE MEDICAL CHW BENEFIT TO ROUTE THAT RELATE TO WORK FOR SUSTAINABILITY. TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PLANS THAT ARE DEVELOPED BY MEDI CAL. CARE PUT THAT WILL INFORM FISHERIES OF THIS NEW SERVICE THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE. AND WE BUILD AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENTS OF THIS BENEFIT FOR THE PURPOSE OF MONITORING OUTCOMES AND TO ESTABLISH THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS BEEN CONVENING STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE TO CAREFULLY DEVELOPED THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT THAT MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE SPOT CONTAINS THE GUIDELINES AND PARAMETERS OF THE DEPARTMENT AND MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS MUST USE WHEN PROVIDING C. H. W. SERVICES STARTING JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO. AB TWENTY SIX NINETY SEVEN. OF THE SPA THIS FAR. WITH REGARDS TO TERMS ON ELIGIBILITY THE SCOPE OF SERVICES THAT C. H. W.'S CAN PROVIDE AND MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS TO ENTER THIS CRITICAL WORKFORCE COMMUNITY STRONGHOLDS AND EQUITY STRATEGY AND REDUCING RACIAL DISPARITIES HOWEVER THEY HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR CENTRAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE. THAT IS ONLY UNTIL RELATIVELY RECENTLY WITH EFFORTS LIKE AB TWENTY SIX NINETY SEVEN AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO HIRE AND RECRUIT NEARLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND C. H. W. THE CROSS THE STREET. THAT THESE WORKERS ARE FINALLY BEING RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR INVALUABLE ABILITY TO WORK WITH COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AB TWENTY SIX NINETY SEVEN WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE ABILITY TO REVIEW AND APPROVE. PROPOSED EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. THAT ARE TO BE DEVELOPED BY MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS CREATING ACCESS IS ONE STEP BUT IN ORDER FOR THE STATE TO SEE SUCCESSFULOUTCOMES THEN THE UTILIZATION OF SERVICES. THERE MUST BE TARGETED CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY RELEVANT OUTREACH GOALS TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS. LASTLY AB TWENTY SIX NINETY SEVEN WILL REQUIRE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ANNUALLY ASSESS CHW OUTCOMES ENSURE THOSE ASSESSMENTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT. I TRACKING OUTCOMES THE DEPARTMENT THE LEGISLATURE CONSUMER ADVOCATES AND COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS CAN MONITOR IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE BEING SERVED WE URGE AND I BOTH FROM THE COMMITTEE ON AB TWENTY SIX NINETY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. IT CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M TAYLOR WITH THE SACRAMENTO HEALTH EDUCATION COUNCIL ON THE LOWER LATINO COALITION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA AS THEY'RE KNOWN IN SPANISH BERMAN THOUGHT US ARE AN IMPORTANT CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE WORK FORCE THAT COMPLEMENTS OUR STATE'S MEDICAL AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. WE HOPE TO DELIVER QUALITY INAPPROPRIATE CARE FOR CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE COMMUNITIES REACH PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CARE IN INFORMATION IN THEIR LANGUAGE. I PROVIDE SERVICES SIX TIMES A MONTH IN THE MEXICAN CONSULATE OF SACRAMENTO. TWO WEEKS AGO I MET LIZ A MONOLINGUAL SPANISH SPEAKER WHO ORIGINALLY CAME IN TO GET HER TAXES FILED.

UNITY HEALTH WORKERS SERVE AN ESSENTIAL FUNCTION OF HEALTH CARE OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL IMPATIENT SIDING. THERE BEEN MANY TIMES WHEN WORKING ON A MOBILE WORLD BOXING CLINIC WHERE MOST PARTICIPANTS ARE SPANISH SPEAKING THE I AM THE ONLY STAFF ON THE FLOOR HELPING CLIENTS. I'M PRESENT ALL POINTS OF INTERACTION FROM HELPING REGISTER FILLING OUT PAPERWORK. I AM TRANSLATING MEDICAL HISTORY QUESTIONS. IN CARE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THEIR STAFF AS WELL AS CONDUCTING PATIENT EXPERIENCE SURVEYS.

BECAUSE WE REPRESENT A SIMILAR CULTURE TO THE COMMUNITY WE LIVE IN AND WE HAVE LIVED IN EXPERIENCE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE DISCUSSED AROUND HEALTH.

THANK YOU PERFECT THANK YOU. YOUR PERCEPTION THERE SO WE CAN HEAR YOU THANK YOU MY NAME IS MARCEL CEDARS AND I AM A PHYSICIAN AT UCSF I'M A REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGIST AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE. BERMAN GOOD ANY MEMBERS INFERTILITY HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A DISEASE BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. THE AMERICAN MEDICAL SOCIETY NEWS ORGANIZATION I AM PROUD TO HEAD THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE. AND YET CALIFORNIA LAW SETS INFERTILITY APART FROM OTHER DISEASES ID ONE. PERVERSE WAY. INFERTILITY IS THE ONLY DISEASE THAT IS FREQUENTLY COVERED TO DIAGNOSE BUT NOT TO COMPREHENSIVELY TREAT INFERTILITY INSURANCE. AND EVEN WHEN A PLAYER'S REQUEST COVERAGE INSURERS CAN EXCLUDE IN VITRO FERTILIZATION. IT ALSO DEFINES INFERTILITY IN SUCH A NARROW WAY AS TO EXCLUDE THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND SINGLE PEOPLE NEEDING MEDICAL INTERVENTION TO BUILD THEIR FAMILIES. AS DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AT UCSF I CAN ATTEST THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO THIS OUR DAUGHTER DAVID LAW ARE TWO FOLD WHO DO NOT EVEN SEE CARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS OR FINANCES AND THEY THEREFORE SUFFER THE EMOTIONAL COSTS OF STRUGGLING TO GROW THE FAMILIES THEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE. PATIENT BUT ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE MOST EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT OF IVF BECAUSE COST WOULD BE OUT OF POCKET AS IVF IS NOT A COVERED BENEFIT UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. THESE PATIENTS OFTEN SEEK LESS EFFECTIVE SOMETIMES RISKIER AND COSTLY TREATMENTS THAT ULTIMATELY LEAD TO DOWNSTREAM HEALTH ISSUES FOR BOTH THE PREGNANT PERSON AND CHILDREN OR CHILD OR CHILDREN. WE INCREASING THE FAT AND THE STATE. WHEN THE FULL SUITE OF TREATMENTS INCLUDING IVF IS COVERED PHYSICIANS ARE ABLE TO TAILOR CARE TO EACH PATIENT CHOOSING THE LEAST EXPENSIVE AND LEAST INVASIVE THAT IS MOST MEDICALLY EFFECTIVE ACCORDING TO CURRENT GUIDELINES. FERTILITY TREATMENT IS PART OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE JUST LIKE MATERNITY CARE IN FAMILY PLANNING IT IS. THAT OUR INSURANCE LAW. THIS REALITY AND PROVIDE THE SAME KIND OF INSURANCE COVERAGE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING RENT PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE OR USING THOSE SAME DOLLARS TO START THEIR FAMILY. ASK THAT YOU PASS. B. TWENTY TWENTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS WITH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WOULD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANABEL ADAMS AND I SUPPORT AB TWENTY TWENTY NINE BECAUSE IDEA OF COVERAGE IS HEALTHCARE. WITHOUT THIS HEALTHCARE I HAVE SUFFERED SIX PREGNANCY LOSSES BUT SEVENTY TWO WEEKS OF PREGNANCY SYMPTOMS LIKE MORNING SICKNESS AND NAUSEA. OVER THREE AND A HALF. THAT'S COUNTLESS PRESENTS AND A YEARNING TO BUILD A FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN CRUSHED BY DRAMATIC LOST TIME AND TIME AGAIN AFTER ALL THIS I STILL HAVE ZERO LIVING CHILDREN. I AM THE ONE WITH THE DISEASE OF INFERTILITY WHICH INCLUDES PEOPLE WHO HAVE TROUBLE GETTING PREGNANT. AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE TROUBLE SUSTAINING A PREGNANCY. I'M HERE TO REPRESENT THE FAMILIES WHO CAN CONCEIVE NATURAL PREGNANCIES BUT FOR WHOM IVF WOULD HELP THEM BRING HOME THE BABY IN THEIR ARMS. I WAS BORN WITH TOPIC TWIST. ON ONE OF MY FIFTH CHROMOSOMES JUST CALLED A CHROMOSOME VERSION. IT'S ONE OF A HANDFUL GENETIC ALTERATIONS CALLED STRUCTURAL CHROMOSOME REARRANGEMENTS. BECAUSE THE ONLY AFFECT A PERSON'S ABILITY TO CONCEIVE. MOST PEOPLE BURKE ABILITY TO CONCEIVE A HEALTHY PREGNANCY MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE ONE OR THAT THEIR PARTNER HAS ONE UNTIL THE EXPERIENCING BECAUSE HE US.

TRANSFERRED WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE DOCTOR RECOMMENDED CURE TO MY CONDITION IVF WAS UNCOVERED BY MY INSURANCE IT FELT LIKE ANOTHER LOSS HANG UP GOOD FOR US F. MY HOPE NIGHT ARE ALL. OUR CHILDREN SPEND. HERE TO THEIR BIRTH. WITH ANY OF COVERAGE. WE FELT INCLINED TO PLAY THE LOTTERY OF CONCEIVING NATURAL PREGNANCIES AND THE HOPES WE GET A PREGNANCY UNAFFECTED BY MY GENETIC ISSUE. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CANCER IN MANDATING IVF COVERAGE IS THAT IT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE I'D LIKE TO. CONCERN INTO THIS MANDATING IVF COVERAGE RECURRENT PREGNANCY LOSSES BECAUSE FINANCIAL PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM MY LAST MISCARRIAGE SURGERY COST UTERINE SCARRING WHICH HAD UNSUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH A LEFT ME STERILE.

YEAH THIS WOULD ALL. PERTAIN TO THEM IF THEY NEED TO HAVE A MAMMOGRAM OR IS A MAMMOGRAM I MEAN THAT'S JUST ME- RATE. AN MRI YEAH ENUMERATOR. HOW DO YOU DO THAT YEAH SO LET ME JUST- TWO POINTS TO THAT IT ACTUALLY DOES APPLY TO MEN AS WELL AND- SO APPLY TO WOMEN WHO ARE YOUNGER OR OLDER THAN OUR TYPICAL SCREENING- RECOMMENDATIONS AND- AS MOSTOF YOU KNOW. THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE PARTICULARLY RISKS NEED TO SCREENING OUTSIDE OF THE REGULAR TIME AND NEED TO DO SCREENING OUTSIDE OF REGULAR MAMMOGRAMS. SO SOMEBODY I KNOW HAS A VERY STRONG FAMILY HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER SO SHE GETS MRI'S. NOT SPEAK MAMMOGRAMS AND IF SHE WASN'T ABLE TO GET THAT COPAY COVERED. THEN SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET THE NECESSARY SCREEN TESTS DONE. SO ABSOLUTELY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND I YOU KNOW JUST. SPEAKING TO THE PERSON IN OPPOSITION. THAT WE KNOW THAT THE COST OF. NEEDED ACTION- WE- IS FAR LESS THAN THE COST OF TREATING ADVANCED CANCER. SO ULTIMATELY IN TERMS OF THE BURDEN ON OUR PATIENTS LIVES AND ON OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THE STATE'S MONEY. EVERY YEAR I GIVE MYSELF A BIRTHDAY GIFT JUST LIKE A BIRTHDAY CARD AND ON MY BIRTHDAY I GOING GET A MAMMOGRAM. CLOCKWORK SINCE MY MOTHER PASSED CAN'T. OKAY S. KOREA. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO YOU AND TO ALL OF US THAT HAVE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS- AB THREE AUNTS- BE A LITTLE BIT MEDINA MEDINA AND MY DENTAL SEAT. ALL AGES. BEING THE OLD. AND THEY ALL DECIDED SOME YEARS AGO TO GO GET MAMMOGRAMS- WAS TOO LATE FOR MY OF MY DEVELOPER WHO WAS THE OLDEST OF THE THREE SISTERS. THEY ALL HAD SOME FORM OF BREAST CANCER. THEY ALL HAD DOUBLE MASTECTOMIES. MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT LOST HER LIFE. MY IDEALISTIC THE HER BREAST CANCER CAME AGAIN YOUNGEST SISTER WAS ABLE TO DETECT IT EARLY BUT BECAUSE IT WAS OF THEIR AGES. AND FROM A LATINO FAMILY. IT IS OFTEN A CONVERSATION THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITHIN OUR FAMILY SO THERE'S A LOT OF EDUCATION THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITHIN. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WITHIN THE LATINO COMMUNITY THE LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE RELIANT ON COMMUNITY CLINICS FOR HEALTH CARE MOST OF THE TIME IF YOUR MEDICAL RECIPIENT. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE HEALTHCARE THAT THEY HAD WITH THEIR UNION THE TEAMSTERS. BUT IT WASN'T- SOON ENOUGH IT WASN'T DONE EARLY ENOUGH FOR- MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT THE ELDEST OF THE THREE. AND UNFORTUNATELY SHE LOST HER LIFE TO IT. BUT I'M GLAD THAT AT LEAST THERE WAS ACCESS AND THEY WERE ABLE TO RETURN THEY WERE ABLE TO GET ADDITIONAL CARE BUT WE ALL IN SOME POINT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY IT AND IT'S SOMETHING MY SISTERS AND I THINK ABOUT OFTEN AND THE REST OF- THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY. THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR BRING IN A VERY VALID POINT. THAT BREAST CANCER IS SOMETHING ALSO THAT. MEN CAN ALSO GET. AND SO I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I'M THANKFUL FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN SUPPORT AND I HOPE AGAIN. THAT THE OPPOSITION. LUSATIAN THAT. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CONVERSATION THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE LEGISLATURE UNTIL WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE. HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. AND THE WHOLE OTHER CONVERSATION. BUT WE START YOU KNOW WITH THIS THAN WITH OTHER THINGS AND MOVE IT ONE STEP AT A TIME AND I HOPE THAT WE DO FIND SOME PLACE TO AT THE END OF THE DAY PROVIDE EQUITY AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS CARILLO. ANYBODY ELSE ANY OTHER MEMBERS. WE COULD USE A MOTION AND- OKAY WAIT OKAY THERE WE GO WE GOT A MOTION AND A MOTION BY MISS CARILLO SECOND BY MISTAKE. I JUST COMMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MYSTERY REFERRING IN THIS BILL- I LOOK AT THIS IN MANY WAYS AS A AS PREVENTIVE I MEAN IT ISN'T THE PRIMARY SCREEN BUT IT'S ADDITIONAL SCREENING AND- WHEN I LOOK AT THAT RIGHT THINK ABOUT THAT. THE VALUE OF THAT FOR THE LIFE OF THE PERSON INVOLVED- ACTUALLY EAT. FISH DINNER REDUCING THE COSTS OF HEALTH. OF OVER ALL. I SOMETIMES WHAT IF SOME OF THE OPPOSITION IS PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH- WHEN YOU'RE- OUT ITS- NOT A HUGE IMPACT I DO RECOGNIZE THAT THE WITH THAT THE BILL'S ARE THAT OUR MANDATES DO I COME RETIRE AT BUT ALL ALL THINGS CONSIDERED THIS IS A GOOD BILL AND I APPRECIATE BRINGING IT FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DO HAVE A QUESTION A SECOND WHICH I CLOSE I TO SAY THAT I HAD NEVER HAD AMERICA- ABOUT IT. WE'RE MADE IT. IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE. BECAUSE I WAS IN MY THIRTIES I WAS TOO YOUNG FOR REGULAR SCHEDULED MAMMOGRAMS. AND I WAS LUCKY IN THAT. THE TREATMENT THAT I HAD WERE YOU KNOW WORKED. BECAUSE MEDICAL SCIENCE. I'M MY SISTER IMMEDIATELY WAS GIVEN A COUPLE WAS GIVEN A YEARLY MRI SCREENING- BECAUSE OF THAT RISK AND BECAUSE OF THE- CENSUS OF HER TISSUE. SURE ENOUGH FOUR YEARS LATER SHE ALSO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND ON A REGULAR MAMMOGRAM IT. TOMORROW DETAIL. VERY EARLY. SO I THINK THAT THIS WILL SAVE LIVES AND I APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE IN YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS FRIEDMAN- THAT SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHEN I WOULD I WALDRON. WALDRON AYE AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY AYE ARAMBULA. BIGELOW. CARILLO I FLORA FLORA NOT VOTING MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN AYE MAYES. MCCARTY. NAZARIAN NAZARIAN I REQUEST RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ AYE SANTIAGO SANTIAGO AYE GARCIA. THE BILL HAS EIGHT VOTES AT BILLS OUT- AND THAT JUST TO CLARIFY THE MOTION WAS FROM- THIS CARILLO SECOND PREMISE AGUIAR-CURRY IT WAS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO PREPARATION SO THEY GIVE YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL YES AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY ONE- WE HAVE HAD HEARD A LOT OVER THE LAST IN THE LAST FEW YEARS ABOUT P. FOSS- THESE DAYS FIRST CLASS PERSON COME THAT ARE PENSION SURPRISING ENOUGH IS. CARE PRODUCTS. MAKE UP. SKIN CARE- HAIR IS SUPPLIES YOU'RE SMEARING IT ON YOUR FACE IF YOU PUT ON A SKIN CREAMS OFTEN. AND UGH THESE PRODUCTS SHED P. FOSS NOT ONLY EXPOSING HUMAN BEINGS BUT AGAIN WHEN YOU WASH YOUR FACE GOING INTO THE WATER SUPPLY. AND WE KNOW THAT THESE CHEMICALS HAVE ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS AND ARE A HUGE SOURCE OF CONCERN AS AN EMERGING CONTAMINANT FOR WATER SUPPLIERS AND- MANY FACTORS I DO ADD. HE FOSS INTENTIONALLY TO PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT ESSENTIAL THAT THERE ARE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE WITHOUT THESE THAT ARE PERFECTLY GOOD. A RESTRICTION ON THE SALE OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING INTENTIONALLY OUT OF PEOPLE US IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO PRODUCTS. THAT DO NOT PRESENT A DIRE RISK TO THEIR OWN HEALTH AND TO THE ENVIRONMENT. IT IS BILL. ONLY OUT. ST TO FIND OUT IF THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLY. WITH THE EFFORTS TO BAN P. FOSS. AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM VERY CLOSELY ON THIS LEGISLATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO MEET WITH THEM TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE. BUT THEY SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS AND THE NECESSITY OF IT- WE- I BOUGHT A CALIFORNIA EXPECTED IF THEY'RE GONNA BUY SOMETHING ON THE SHELVES AND A CALIFORNIA STORE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE SAFE FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILY AND THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY ONE IT'S JANET NUDELMAN DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM AND POLICY WITH BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS. AND ANY JACKSON A CO FOUNDER AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT CREDO BEAUTY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JANET NUDELMAN I'M THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM AND POLICY AT BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS. I AM SO USED TO BE TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY ONE ON BEHALF OF THE CPP AND BILLS OTHER TO CO SPONSORS THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP AS WELL AS THE SIXTY LEADING NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND BUSINESSES THAT SUPPORT IT. CONCERNS ARE MOUNTING WORLDWIDE ABOUT THE TOXICITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERSISTENCE OF P. FIVE CHEMICALS. CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY PROHIBITED THE ENTIRE CLASS OF P. FAST FROM BEING USED IN FIREFIGHTING FOAM FOOD PACKAGING IN JUVENILE PRODUCTS YET THERE IS NO STATE OR FEDERAL LAW THAT PROHIBITS THE USE OF THESE VRY TOXIC FOREVER CHEMICALS. FROM COSMETIC PRODUCTS THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE A RECENT STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME FOUND HIGH AMOUNTS OF P. FASTENED OVER HALF OF THE BEAUTY PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THEY TESTED. HOWEVER EQUALLY CONCERNING IS TE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE P. FAST DETECTED IT BY THE STUDY DIDN'T EVEN APPEAR ON THE PRACTICALLY OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WERE TESTED. CREATING A BUYER BEWARE SITUATION. TO ASSEMBLY. IS A PUBLIC PROBLEM. THESE LOCALS HAVE ALSO. THE DRINKING OF OVER SEVENTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS. VERY LOW DOSES OF PEETHAS CHEMICALS IN DRINKING WATER HAVE BEEN LINKED TO AN INCREASED RISK OF CANCER REPRODUCTIVE AND INSISTED PART. AND LET AND FIERY DISEASE AND P. FAST EXPOSURE IS ALSO LINKED TO ELEVATED RISK OF BREAST CANCER HORMONE DISRUPTION AND OTHER SERIOUS HEALTH CAN. THIS WELL. CAN HIM CALIFORNIA CAN WATER HAS BEEN SHOWN TO JUST. IMPACT ALREADY BURDENED COMMUNITIES BY MULTIPLE SOURCES OF POLLUTION AND BY OTHER FACTORS THAT MAKE THEM EVEN MORE SENSITIVE TO POLLUTION. IN THESE OWNERS KEEP A GREATER RISK OF HARM FROM P. FAST EXPOSURE. ELIMINATING P. FAST FROM COSMETIC PRODUCTS WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF P. FAST THE FLUSHES DOWN THE DRAIN AFTER WE BATES THAT WATER AND SANITATION AGENCIES HAVE TO MANAGE AND REMOVE. EVEN THE VERY SERIOUS IMPACT P. FATS CHEMICALS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT CHEMICAL SHOULD NOT BE IN THE BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS YOU EVERY DAY. THING AND NOT PRICES. THANK EXT CALIFORNIA ONCE HOW THE OPPORTUNITY LEAD THE WAY IN TERMS OF COSMETIC SAFETY I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU- AND MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M ANNE JACKSON CO FOUNDER AND CEO- ACT CREDO. CREDO IS THE LARGEST RETAILER OF CLEAN BEAUTY PRODUCTS IN THE WORLD SELLING OVER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE INDEPENDENT BEAUTY BRANDS THROUGH OUR BRICK AND MORTAR STORES AND WEBSITE. AND WE ARE HEADQUARTERED IN ST SCOUT. IT IS ARTWORK CITING SAFETY AND SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS CREDO IS CONSIDERED A LEADER IN THE FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR CLEAN COSMETICS INDUSTRY. CREDO INTERBRAND HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO CREATE THE SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT AMERICANS ARE ASKING FOR. WE PROHIBIT BRANDS FROM INTENTIONALLY ADDING P. FOSS IN THE PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL AND SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN THE ENTIRE CLASS OF P. FIVE S. AS BEEN ON CREATORS RESTRICTED SUBSTANCE LIST OF CHEMICALS. SOME PRODUCT FOR FORMULATORS THESE ARE THE CAMERAS TO MAKE THE SKIN CARE AND BEAUTY PRODUCTS THAT WE ALL USE INTENTIONALLY ADD P. FAST AS LISTED INGREDIENTS. OTHER TIMES P. FOSTER USED AT ASSESSING AIDS COATINGS OR TREATMENTS TO HELP WITH AN INGREDIENT OR PACKAGING'S PERFORMANCE. BUT THESE TRACE OR INCIDENTAL INGREDIENTS DO NOT HAVE TO BE DECLARED TO BRANDS OR RETAILERS LET ALONE REMARKS. SO IN SOME INSTANCES HE LAST MAY BE DETECTED IN A COSMETIC PRODUCT NOT BECAUSE THE SKIN CARE BEAUTY BRAND WANTED IT THERE AS PART OF ITS RECIPE. BUT BECAUSE IT WAS ADDED SOMEWHERE A LOT BECAUSE NEXT APPLY CHAIN OFTEN WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT OF THE BRAND OWNER. SO CREDO AND OUR BRAND PARTNERS TELL EVERYONE UP AND DOWN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN THAT WE DO NOT WANT P. FILES TO BE USED. BUT LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHO HOW AND WHERE P. FOSTER INTENTIONALLY ADDED AS PROCESSING MANUFACTURING AIDS. MAKES IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR INDEPENDENT BEAUTY PART OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE PRODUCT THEY MAY. SELL DO NOT CONTAIN THE TOXIC CHEMICAL. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY THIS BELT SO THE CLEANING. WE DO NOT WANT ANY P. FAST THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE AVOIDED AND ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS. RESHAPED ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S FRIEDMAN PLAN TO WORK WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO FLUSH OUT THE DEFINITION OF INTENTIONALLY ADDED P. FOSTER AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN ONE IT'S CLEAR AS TO WHAT IS. AND WHAT IS NOT CONTENT ARE CONSIDERED INTENSELY ADDED A STRONG DEFINITION OF INTENTIONALLY ADDED P. FAST WILL HELP OSMETIC MANUFACTURERS RETAILERS LIKE CREDO AND HOLD OUR SUPPLY CHAIN ACCOUNTABLE. BEAUTY INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO MAKE THEIR P. FOSS ARE NOT WELCOME HERE AND AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN ONCE A CRITICAL STEP IN THIS FIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

GOOD AFTERNOON A GERMAN WOULD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MANDY LEE I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN ONE A BILL TO BAN P.

FOSSE'S. AVOID TRACE CONTEMPT. QUITE PLEASE IN AS IT ANALYSIS NOTES- VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE THE TRIP UP COMPLIANCE WITH THE BILL FOR INSTANCE THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DEFINED WOULD CAPTURE FLUORIDES LIKE TFA WHICH ARE ALREADY FOUND IN THE WATER SUPPLY SOILS CLAYS COMPANIES USED WATER WHICH IS ONE OF THE SINGLE MOST COMMON INGREDIENTS IN COSMETICS THERE MAY BE TECHNICALLY UNDERWENT A TRAIT LEVEL IT AND THAT GET INTO PRODUCTS. THIS BILL MUSKER BIGELOW P. FIVE REYES LEVELS AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE BANNING INTENTIONALLY ADDED P. FAST IN GROUP AND AT RATHER THAN INGREDIENTS WITH TRACES. THIS PRINCIPLE WAS ADOPTED IN TWENTY TWENTY. AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY MURATSUCHI WHICH BANNED SEVERAL INTENTIONALLY ADDED INGREDIENTS AND CONTAIN LANGUAGE THAT WAS CLEAR THAT TECHNICALLY UNAVOIDABLE TRACE CONTAMINANTS WERE NOT IN SCOPE. PC PC IN A WIDER GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS STRONGLY SUPPORTED THIS EFFORT- THIS WAS APPROVED BY THIS BODY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR. WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CAN CONTINUE CONTINUING TO DO SO USE ME. BUT UNTIL OUR OUR CONCERNS ARE WORK THROUGH WE I RESPECTFULLY REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMEND. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE.

YOUR FOES HAVE A VERY LOW GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND REDUCE GROUND LEVEL OZONE FORMATION. GIVING THEM AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REACHING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. HFO AEROSOL PROPELLANTS ARE VITAL FOR MANUFACTURERS TO HAVE IT AVAILABLE FOR COMPLIANCE COMING LOWER V. THIS IS. CARP WHEN WE TO ABOUT FOREVER WE TALK ABOUT HOW THEY ARE PERSISTENT BIO ACCUMULATIVE- AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS BILL IN THIS COMMITTEE WE TALK BIG WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE TOXIC HFO THERE NONE OF THOSE THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT REVIEWED HFO ONE TWO THREE FOUR ZERO P.

ANOTHER LEGISLATION LIKE IT AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT IT'S SUPPOSE THAT WAS REFERENCED BY THE GENTLEMAN. I'M EVEN THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES MAY HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO BE SAFE BY SOME OF THESE THEY TURN INTO A DIFFERENT CHEMICAL CALLED TFA WHICH DOES HAVE HAVE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. THESE ARE NOT WIDELY USED RIGHT NOW IN COSMETICS AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL GIVEN THE HISTORY THAT WE HAVE OF INTRODUCING THESE CHEMICALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. PARTICULARLY IN SOMETHING THAT YOUR SPRING. ID THAT LATER ON TURNED OUT TO. BE SO DEVASTATING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND I ALSO HAVE TO SAY THAT I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER IT WAS ONE OF THESE KINDS OF CHEMICALS THAT CAUSED MY CANCER AND MY SISTER'S CANCER. THAT I.

IF TWO BILLS BEFORE. AB. TWENTY NINETY ONE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TIME AND WORKING ON THIS BILL IN THE PAST YEAR MULTIPLE STATES HAVE RAMPED UP THEIR ANTI ABORTION EFFORTS AND PASSED LAWS TARGETING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION LAST YEAR ALONE A HUNDRED AND EIGHT ABORTION RESTRICTIONS WERE ENACTED IN NINETEEN. THIS INCLUDES TAXES WHERE THE MOST RECENT ANTI ABORTION LAW ENCOURAGES PRIVATE CITIZENS. TO ACT AS BOUNTY HUNTERS TO SEEK OUT AND SUE THOSE PROVIDE ANY FORM OF SUPPORT TO. TO PEOPLE SEEKING AN ABORTION INCLUDING THEIR DOCTOR THEIR NURSE A FRIEND TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHETHER TO GET THE ABORTION EVEN THAT WEBER DRIVER. WITH THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT LATER OVERTURNED THE PROTECTIONS GRANTED. UNDER ROE V. WADE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE HAVE IMPROVED ABORTION ACCESS AND STRENGTHEN PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE SEEKING. INSTEAD OF SERVICES PEOPLE ALREADY ARE WELL ARE AND WILL CONTINUE TO COME TO CALIFORNIA FREE ACT OF HEALTH CARE. HOWEVER WE WORRY THAT ARE OUT OF STATE PRIVATE CITIZENS AND ACTORS WILL DEMAND THE MEDICAL RECORDS OF THOSE WHO SEE CARE HERE. TO PUNISH THEM FOR EXERCISING THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MINUTES MINUTE CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL TEAM TO GET WHICH PEOPLE WHO SEEK AND REFUGE HERE. MY BILL A NEW NINETY ONE WILL ENSURE OUT OF STATE SUBPOENA. WHICH SEEK INFORMATION RELATED TO A PATIENT WHO RECEIVED GROUP REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ARE NOT GRANTED BY DOING THIS CALIFORNIA WILL PROTECT THE MEDICAL PRIVACY OF THOSE PATIENTS WHO MAY BE TARGETED BY HOSTILE LAWS IN OTHER STATES. AB TWENTY NINETY ONE ALSO ENSURES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE CAN ENFORCE VIOLATIONS. OF THE RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORDS RELATED TO SENSITIVE SERVICES. AB TWENTY NINE CAN. BE NINETY ONE CAN. LEGISLATORS WORK OF PROTECTING PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE AND THEIR MEDICAL INFORMATION THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY IS DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY LAWS. THAT UNDERMINE ABORTION CARE WHICH COMPOUNDS LONGSTANDING BARRIERS INCLUDES CARE. EXACERBATES NEGATIVE HEALTH DISPARITIES. CALIFORNIA MUST PROACTIVELY PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL RECORDS OF EVERYONE. AS WE STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY PAVING THE WAY TO USE THOSE WRECKED ENFORCE THEIR OWN STATES. ANTI ABORTION. THANK YOU AND IS WITNESS TODAY I HAVE SOME OF. MY SPUR WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA A CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL. THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD. YEAH DOCTOR WERE A MEMBERS OF THE- I'M LISA MATSUBARA ON BEHALF OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THE SEVEN AFFILIATES IN THE STATE OPERATING OVER A HUNDRED HEALTH CENTER. HE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS UNDER ROE V. WADE ARE NO LONGER ENSURING ACCESS TO ABORTION ACROSS THE NATION. EVEN AS THE US SUPREME COURT CONSIDERS A DIRECT CHALLENGE TO ROE THE COURT HAS ALREADY UPHELD TEXAS SENATE BILL EIGHT. IN ITS DELIBERATE LEGAL SCHEME TO CIRCUMVENT JUDICIAL REVIEW OF AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAW. ALLOWING TEXAS TO RELY ON PRIVATE CITIZENS CIVIL LAWSUITS TO TAKE PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. THE TEXAS ABORTION BAN HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS. AT THE SAME TIME ANTI ABORTION LAWMAKERS HAVE INTRODUCED OVER FIVE HUNDRED RESTRICTIONS IN FORTY TWO STATES SO FAR THIS YEAR. WITH ABORTION BANS BEING RECENTLY ENACTED IN ARIZONA. IDAHO WYOMING FLORIDA KENTUCKY AND OKLAHOMA. THESE BANDS CREATE A CULTURE OF FEAR AND AIM TO MAKE PATIENTS CARE TO SEE CARE OR CLINICIANS TO PROVIDE THE CARE. THE RECENT LY ENACTED BILL IN OKLAHOMA WILL ACTUALLY MAKE THE PROVISION OF ABORTION A FELONY. IN OTHER STATES LIKE MISSOURI LAWMAKERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO BAN RESIDENTS FROM LEAVING THE STATE TO OBTAIN AN ABORTION. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS OVER THIRTY SIX MILLION PEOPLE FOLKS IN OVER HOW STATES WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ABORTION IN OUR HOME STATE. THESE BANDS DENY PEOPLE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE HARM PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY FACING SYSTEM. THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND PEOPLE TO FLEE THEIR HOMES STATES TO GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE. WE'RE PROUD OF THE WORK THAT THIS STATE AND THIS LEGISLATURE HAS DONE AND IS DOING TO ENSURE ABORTION ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA. MUST BE MORE. FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD PROTECTING PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY IS AT THE CORE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUR AFFILIATES. A PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORDS SHOULD NEVER BE USED TO PUNISH SOMEONE FOR OBTAINING AN ABORTION. A RIGHT THAT IS EXPLICITLY PROTECTED UNDER OUR STATE LAWS. AB TWENTY NINETY ONE ESTABLISHES SAFEGUARDS IN THE LAW TO PROTECT THE MEDICAL RECORDS OF ABORTION PATIENTS. THAT THIS INFORMATION IS NOT USED AS EVIDENCE IN AND OUT OF STATE CASE TO PENALIZE THE PATIENT WHO SEEKS CARE IN OUR STATE. AND WOULD SIMILARLY PROTECT THOSE WHO PROVIDE ABORTIONS OR ASSIST. TO SEE KAREN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT CALIFORNIA CAN BE A SAFE HAVEN FOR THOSE WHO SEEK THE ABORTION CARE IN OUR STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON THERESA BRENNAN PRESIDENT OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE LEAGUE. THIS BILL IS A COMPANION PIECE TO AB ONE SIX SIX SIX LIKE THAT BILL AB TWENTY NINETY ONE IMPERMISSIBLY DECLARES ANOTHER STATE SUBPOENA AND JUDICIAL ORDERS NULL AND VOID. AB TWO ZERO NINE ONE VIOLATES THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION WHICH STATES FULL FAITH AND CREDIT SHALL BE GIVEN IN EACH STATE TO THE PUBLIC ACTS RECORDS AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF EVERY OTHER STATE. WHETHER THIS BILL WILL FALL UNDER THE PUBLIC POLICY EXCEPTION OR WHETHER IT WILL BE FOUND UNCONSTITUTIONAL REMAINS TO BE SEEN IT WILL BE DECIDED IN THE COURTS. EITHER WAY AB TWO ZERO NINE ONE IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT DECLARES ANOTHER STATE'S COURT ORDERS TO HAVE NO EFFECT WITH WARNING ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN LAWS. FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE AB TWENTY NINETY ONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM EITHER IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONES.

AND IT IS NO LONGER USED OR WILL BE USED FOR ANY ACUTE CARE SERVICES. A BRIDGE WHICH CONNECTED THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING TO THE STEVENS WEARING- WAS DEMOLISHED SO ALL ACUTE CARE FUNCTIONS ARE SEPARATED FROM ANY BUILDING THAT'S NOT COMPLIANT WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY STANDARDS- WE ALSO RELOCATED THE BIGGEST PORTION OF THE EXPENSE OF THE PROJECT WAS RELOCATING THE KITCHEN TO THE STEVENS WING WHICH WILL BE A TWENTY TWENTY COMPLIANT BUILDING- THAT WAS PROBABLY A COST OF ABOUT TWENTY MILLION OUT OF THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION THE STEVENS WING WAS UPGRADED- TO- A. S. B. C. TO BUILDING AND THEREFORE MEETS THE TWENTY TWENTY STANDARDS. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS- WE HAVE WORKED WITH ARCHITECTS TO TRY TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO COMPLY WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY THIRTY STANDARDS BY TWENTY THIRTY UNFORTUNATELY THAT SCENARIO- TURNED OUT TO BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE AT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ALSO WOULD HAVE BEEN SO COMPLEX AND DISRUPTIVE THAT IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE NECESSITATED THE HOSPITAL CLOSING FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS. IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO WE B. WE WENT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND TRY TO LOOK AT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BRING ALL THE BUILDINGS UP TO COMPLIANCE. BUT AT S. P. C. FOUR D. UP BY TWENTY THIRTY- AND THE INTENT TO MEET ALL OF THE IN PC- REQUIREMENTS AND ALL OF OUR BUILDINGS THE ONLY EXCEPTION WOULD BE THE BUILDING IN WHICH THE KITCHEN HAS BEEN RELOCATED WHICH WE DO NOT BELIEVE. CAN BE. RESURRECTED TO- A. L. TWENTY THIRTY STANDARD. I'M I'M JUST GOING TO SAY THAT WE HAVE A VERY COMPLICATED PLANNING PROCESS BEFORE US THAT'S LAID OUT IN THE TIMELINE WE PRESENTED- IT IS.

THERE'S. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT THIS IMPORTANT BILL TODAY AT TO MISOGYNY BABCOCK BUT THE COMMITTEE FOR HER ASSISTANCE AND STRICTLY THIS PROPOSAL. AB TWENTY TWO ANYONE PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS IN YOUNG CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH. THE EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WOULD ENABLE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. THE FUND GRANTS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF CARE. FOR THE ZERO FIVE POPULATION THEIR PARENTS FAMILIES AND CAREGIVERS TO THE MILD TO MODERATE NEEDS OF THESE YOUTH IS ESSENTIAL FOR JUST MEANT. UNENCUMBERED BY ANXIETY AND TOXIC STRESS CAUSED BY WHAT HAS BEEN TERMED ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES KNOWN AS ACES. IF LEFT UNTREATED THESE ACES MANIFESTS AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS THIS BILL WOULD ALLEVIATE EXACERBATIONS OF OUR SHARED SYSTEM BY DECREASING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SERIOUS DISEASES DEVELOP LATER IN LIFE. CALIFORNIA'S EMBARKED ON A SIGNIFICANT JOURNEY DISTRICT ARE SUPPORT OF CHILDREN FAMILIES AND ADULT CARE GIVERS. AND APPRECIATION FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AS VITAL AS WE OVERCOME. I'M SORRY AS OUT AS WE COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THERE IS AN EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WHICH WAS INFLAMED BY THE LOCKDOWNS ASSOCIATED WITH COLBERT. WE ALL NEED HELP ADJUSTING TO RAPIDLY CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES IN DEALING WITH THE TRAUMA. THESE GRANTS WILL PRODUCE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES ARE BEST FOR TREATING THE NEEDS OF YOUNG CHILDREN WILL SPUR INNOVATION FOR HOW BEST WE CAN SUPPORT THESE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. I BELIEVE THIS INVESTMENT IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUPPORTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES WITH EARLY INTERVENTION. I HAVE TOBY EWING WITH THE EXECUTIVE I'M SORRY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION WITH ME TODAY. YOU IN.

YOUNG CHILDREN ALSO- EXPERIENCE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS THAT OFTEN GO UNADDRESSED- MANY OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH A COMMON REFRAIN THAT FAMILIES ARE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED TO WAIT UNTIL THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN ENTER SCHOOL TO SECURE AN IEP OR OTHER STRATEGY. IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR PARENTS AND FAMILIES TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN THEY'RE VERY YOUNG CHILDREN. ARE EXPRESSING THEIR NEEDS TO THEIR BEHAVIOR AND IN FACT MY FAMILY HAS EXPERIENCED THIS. AS A RESULT WE SEE THESE DEVASTATING DELAYS IN ACCESS TO CARE AND TREATMENT. AB TWO TWO EIGHT ONE WORST LET'S JUST THE G.

THIS IS THERE ANY LIKE TO PRESENT MR LEVINE'S BILL ON. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WOULD REQUIRE A HEALTH SERVICE PLAN TO APPROVE AND SCHEDULE INITIAL OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF A PERSON'S RELEASE FROM SEVENTY TWO HOUR INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATION CURRENT LAW AUTHORIZES THE TEMPORARY INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO DUE TO MENTAL ILLNESS POSE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. OR WHO ARE GRAVELY DISABLED MEANING THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR BASIC NEEDS OF FOOD CLOTHING OR SHELTER AFTER SEVENTY TWO HOUR INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATION THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING FOLLOW UP CARE ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS CAN BE FRUSTRATING AND COMPLICATED FOR THE DISCHARGED INDIVIDUAL WHO IS OFTEN STILL EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT MENTAL ANGUISH AND IS ILL EQUIPPED TO TAKE NECESSARY STEPS TO OBTAIN FOLLOW UP CARE AND TREATMENT. THERE IS A CLEAR NEED TO EXPEDITE AND STREAMLINE THE PROCESS FOR FOLLOW UP MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT ACCORDING TO A STUDY PUBLISHED IN A GEMMA PSYCHIATRY. IN THE NINETY DAYS FOLLOWING THEIR DISCHARGED PERSONS WITH ANY MENTAL DISORDER OR SEVERELY AT RISK FOR SUICIDE AND R. TWELVE. AND A HALF TIMES MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT SUICIDE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. A. B. EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WILL HELP IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AND ENSURE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE BY REQUIRING THAT A PATIENT RELEASED FROM INVOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITALIZATION RECEIVED AUTHORIZATION FOR CARE WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF THEIR RELEASE- THE AUTHOR MR LEVINE IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE. ON QUESTIONS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND THE ON HIS BEHALF I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. YOUR SHOW NOW. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOHN VAN OVER AND I'M THE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR FOR DVSA CALIFORNIA THE BIPOLAR SUPPORT ALLIANCE AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ON IMPORTANT BILL. IN ADDITION TO BEING ARE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR I AM ALSO APPEAR AND LIVE WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. I HAVE BIPOLAR ONE. AND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I HAD MY FIRST MANIC EPISODE. I AM LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE WONDERFUL FAMILY SUPPORT AND THOUGH WE WERE ALL CAUGHT OFF GUARD MY AUNT EVENTUALLY REALIZED I NEEDED PROFESSIONAL HELP AND TOOK ME TO THE ER WHERE WAS PLACED ON A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. DESPITE THAT MY MOTHER HAD GONE TO THE FACILITY. UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE HOLD I WAS PLACED IN A VAN WITH THREE OTHER MEN AND WE WERE ALL DROPPED OFF AT UNION STATION IN DOWNTOWN LA BEHAVIOR BUT ALSO THE BEHAVIOR OF THE SYSTEM MY LOVED ONES WERE AT A LOSS YET MY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING. MY MANIA QUICKLY WORSENED AND EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A PSYCHOTIC BREAK. WITHIN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS I WAS ARRESTED THREE TIMES FOR MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES. THE FIRST OF MY LIFE WITH THE FINAL ONE BEING A VERBAL ASSAULT OF THE MAILMAN THE PUT ME IN THE COUNTY JAIL FOR THIRTEEN HORRIFIC DAYS. STILL INCREDIBLY SICK. SO IN ADDITION TO MY SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS I KNOW ALSO HAVE PTSD. AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE IS A COMMONSENSE PARITY DRIVEN STEP THE COULD HAVE EASILY CHANGED MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER. OUR STATE DOESN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF EDUCATING THE PUBLIC AND DE STIGMATIZING WHAT A MANIC EPISODE REALLY IS. THE WARNING SIGNS OF MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID OR WHAT TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE. AS A RESULT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR LOVED ONES TO KNOW WHERE TO GO OR WHAT TO DO. EVEN THOUGH THEY DESPERATELY WANT TO HELP. AS INVOLUNTARY HOLDS AMPLIFY THE TRAUMA SOMEONE'S EXPERIENCING IN THAT STATE. IT IS CRITICAL TO GET THEM INFORMATION AND CONNECTION TO VOLUNTARY CARE OPTIONS IMMEDIATELY UPON RELEASE. IF ALL RIGHT AS AN UP. WHITE MALE. GRADUATE DEGREE CAREER HOME THAT I OWNED INSURANCE AND EXCELLENT FAMILY SUPPORT. DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO FOR CARE IN THE MOST POPULOUS CITY IN THE STATE. THEN WHAT CHANCE TO ANY OF US HAVE. DUE TO A LACK OF RESEARCH IN THE FIELD AND INDIVIDUAL STILL CANNOT BE PROPERLY DIAGNOSED WITH BIPOLAR ONE AND THEREFORE TREATED UNTIL THEY HAVE A TRUE MANIC EPISODE. THE MANIA AND WE DON'T JUST HAVE A BAD MORNING THEN BECOME PSYCHOTIC. THERE ARE MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT THE PROGRAM SIMPLY AREN'T AVAILABLE. TRAGICALLY THE LAWS THAT ADDRESS OF YOUR MENTAL ILLNESS AS WELL AS THE MEDICATION I CURRENTLY TAKE OVER HALF A CENTURY OLD. AND PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT US IS EQUALLY ARCHAIC. IN ADDITION TO THE PASSAGE OF AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE OR ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE TO QUICKLY TAKE UP LEGISLATION IN THE NEXT SESSION THE WOULD PROVIDE IDENTICAL PROTECTIONS TO THE UNINSURED. AND SINCE PRO CHOICE. THING THE PROBLEM FOR GETS WORSE THE CAN ONLY IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR THE PUBLIC AND THE STATE. BEFORE WE REIMAGINE OPPORTUNITIES TO WAIT TILL PEOPLE ARE SEVERELY ILL AND THEN REMOVE THEIR RIGHTS CRIMINALIZE THEM AND FORCE THEM INTO TREATMENT. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE TO PUT RESOURCES AND ALL THE OTHER WAYS WE COULD SOLVE THE SYSTEM THAT EVERYONE AGREES IS BROKEN. PUBLIC EDUCATION AND AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DRUGS AND TREATMENT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. AND ACCESS TO VOLUNTARY TREATMENT OPTIONS THE SAME HALLMARKS WE RELIED ON FOR FISCAL HEALTH FOR GENERATIONS. SHOULD BE EMBRACED AND FUNDED RATHER THAN A DORK. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE IN FAVOR OF AB FIFTY NINE. THANK EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN I THINK THREE TIMES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WHAT AN MEMBERS- THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF- FOR ON. AB. FIFTEEN FIFTY NINE MY NAME IS ADAM HORN. SHARE MY- IS IDENTIFYING A FULL FULL AND TIME WE HAVE REGULAR- DELAYED MY OWN UP CARE FROM HEALTH HOLD. NEARLY FOUR YEARS AGO ON ADVICE FROM A CLOSE FRIEND- HERE WHO WORKS IN THE CAPITOL. I MADE A VISIT TO MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER. AND HAT AS I HAD BEEN EXPERT SEVERE DEPRESSION AND A CONSTANT BARRAGE OF THOUGHTS THAT LEAD ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. TO ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. WHILE THERE THE NURSES SOFFIT TO PLACE ME INTO A MENTAL HEALTH HOLD THE REQUESTED PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS. TO TRANSFER ME TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. AFTER SEVEN EIGHT HOURS SITTING ON A GURNEY IN THE HALLWAY OF THE YARD. I WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY AN ON DUTY PSYCHIATRIST. AND WOULD BRIEF AND FREQUENT AT CHECK INS BY A SOCIAL WORKER I WAS RELEASED TO THE CARE OF ANOTHER CLOSE FRIEND. IN A WEEK. AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK I WAS ABLE TO SCHEDULE AN INITIAL FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT. WITH THE SPECIALIST HOWEVER THE SOONEST. I COULD OBTAIN WAS SIX WEEKS AFTER MICHAEL. AT THE HOURS DAYS AND WEEKS PASSED I KEPT WONDERING WHY WAS TAKING SO LONG. FOR ME TO SEE A SPECIALIST- WHY COULDN'T GET THE CAR NEEDED WHILE I CONTINUE TO SUFFER. ALTHOUGH THE PROVIDER ASSIGNED A CASE WORKER WHO CONTINUE TO CALL AND CHECK IN. ON MY STATE. THE CONVERSATIONS WERE DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND. I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING STRUNG ALONG. I EXPRESS MY FRUSTRATION TO THE CASE WORKER AND ASK WHY I COULDN'T HAVE MY- DINNER. THE RESPONSE. REALIZE THE FOOTBALL IN THE TIME WE ACCESS REGULATIONS. THAT UNLESS THE PATIENT EXPLICITLY ASKED FOR CARE- AND MAKE THE REQUEST. THE TIME REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT TRIGGERED. THERE FOR TREATMENT AND FURTHER DELAY IN. IN LIGHT OF MY FRUSTRATION THE CASE WORKER MOVED UP MY APPOINTMENT BUT ONLY BY TWO WEEKS. BROUGHT THE MONTH AFTER MY HOLD I THOUGHT RELIEF FOR THE PAIN THROUGH EXCESSIVE USE OF INTOXICANTS. CONTEST FOR INTENSIFYING THE DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL IDEATION. MY FIRST LIKE I. THANK YOU EFFORT APPOINTMENT WAS THE TURNING POINT I NEEDED AND I WISH I HAD IT SOONER. OVER TIME THE MEDICATION AND TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY HELPED. I BEGAN TO ENJOY LIFE AGAIN. AND THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE DIMINISH DRAMATICALLY. MY EXPERIENCE SHOWED ME THAT WHEN A PATIENT IS IN A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S THEIR FIRST. THEY CAN NOT A PROPERLY UNDERSTAND WHAT STEPS NEED TO BE TAKEN TO GET PROPER CARE. THE SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT NEED TO INSURE THE PROPER CARE. I PROVIDE IS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND WAITING A MONTH TO SEE A DOCTOR IS UNACCEPTABLE. AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE- EX. EXPEDITE DESPERATELY NEEDED CARE. THANK YOU AND I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT A. B. EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THEIR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I DON'T BELIEVE THERE MIGHT BE OKAY NEVER MIND PLEASE COME FORWARD MY APOLOGIES. MOTION BY MISS CARILLO SECOND BY MISS GARCIA. PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JEFF HAMPTON HERE AT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS I REGRETTABLY WE DO HAVE A POST POSITION ON AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE I WISH REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS DETAINED FOR SEVENTY TWO HOUR- TREATMENT AND EVALUATION UNDER THE LANUS PETR SHORT AFTER WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF THE PERSON'S RELEASE. I WE CERTAINLY AGAIN APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AS A MEMBER PLANS ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT OUR ENROLLEES RECEIVE HIGH QUALITY MENTAL HEALTHCARE SERVICES A PERSONALIZED COMPASSIONATE MANNER. HOWEVER A EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS ALREADY ESTABLISHED TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE FOR THESE SERVICES. EXISTING LAW AND REGULATIONS STATUS TIME FRAME FORTY EIGHT TO NINETY SIX HOURS FOR ENSURING URGENT FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS ADD ON THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. WORSHIPED THEIR CONCERNED THAT AB TWO FIFTY NINE- ARBITRARILY MANDATE HEALTH PLANS. FALL PLACEMENT UPON DISCHARGE FROM THE TRADING FACILITY WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS REGARDLESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCE- UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL MAKES SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS DO NOT PRACTICALLY TRANSLATE. REAL WORLD A REAL WORLD SCENARIOS WHICH WE THINK WOULD MAKE THIS BILL VERY CHALLENGING TO IMPLEMENT- FOR INSTANCE THE OFTENTIMES IT TAKES UP TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO DETERMINE IF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS ON A VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY HOLDS HE'S ME I HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM THEIR HOSPITALIZATION ADDITIONALLY THE BILL SOON THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO'S ON AN INVOLUNTARY HOLDS HAS THE PICTURES INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND IS A POSITION TO RELAY THAT INFORMATION TO THEIR HEALTH PLAN. IF THE IN REALLY DOES NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE HOW WOULD THEY OR THEIR SHE PROVIDER KNOW HOW TO CONTACT THE HEALTH PLAN REGARDING FOLLOWED SERVICES IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS. FURTHERMORE THE BILL ASSUMES THAT HEALTH PLAN SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS ON BEHALF OF THEIR ENROLLEES GENERALLY SPEAKING THIS IS NOT THE CASE. I PROVIDERS ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROVIDERS. TYPICALLY WANT TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THE INDIVIDUAL BEFORE SCHEDULING AN APPOINTMENT. I LASTLY IN THE BILL MANDATES THAT HEALTH PLANS ENSURE THAT THE LOCATION OF FACILITIES PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BE WITHIN A REASONABLE PROXIMITY TO THE RELEASE- HOME OR WORK LOCATION. HELLO WE UNDERSTAND THE NETWORK NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS ARE IMPORTANT TO ENSURING THAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL- YOU KNOW MANY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS HAVE EXCLUSIVELY TRANSITIONED TO VIRTUAL PLATFORMS TO DELIVER THE SERVICES. SO- WE'RE NOT BEEN A SUPER CLEAR IF THE BILL IS INTENDED TO EXCLUDE TELEHEALTH FROM CONSIDERATION TO MEET THE STANDARDS BUT IT WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING FOR HEALTH PLANS TO. GO TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE BILL- IF TELEHEALTH WERE EXCLUDED. AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL- BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AT THIS TIME BUT DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR MOVING FORWARD ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIRMAN PERSEPHONE WALKEN'S ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL- ECHO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS. WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE NEED FOR SERVICES AND CARE AFTER DISCHARGE WE JUST THINK THAT IT'S MORE APPROPRIATELY A PART OF THAT JUST CHARGE PROCESS. CERTAINLY VISUALS TRANSITIONING OUT OF THE HOUSEHOLD I'M IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO THAT COMMUNICATION I THINK WE HEARD IN SOME OF THE TESTIMONY THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE NEXT STEPS COULD BE. UNFORTUNATE PART FOR- PLANS IT. PLEASES EARLY NAY. PERSONS THAN JUST CHARGE FROM A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. SO AFTER THE FACT WHEN THE INDIVIDUALS LEFT THE FACILITY FOR US TO THEN. BE INFORMED CONTACT THEM DIRECT AND SET UP AN APPOINTMENT THAT THERE NOW FINANCIALLY OBLIGATED- TO PAY FOR. WITHOUT THEIR INTERFACE OR INTERACTION IS A CONCERN FOR US. SO THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO SORT OF ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND CERTAINLY WORK WITH THE DISCHARGE PROCESS. TO SEE IF THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN THE CHAMBER CHAMBER OF THE HEARING ROOM- IN SUPPORT OR UP IN OPPOSITION- JUST YOUR NAME POSITION AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE.

I DO WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO START LET'S START WITH TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY THREE. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL AND FOR THE SUPPORT THE STAFF IS GIVEN TO OUR OFFICE AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY THREE WOULD INCREASE THE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR REGISTERING AS A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER COUNSELOR OF CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD EXPAND THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER COUNSELOR CERTIFICATION CURRICULUM AND INCREASE THE CERTIFICATION OUR REQUIREMENTS SO THEY ARE NO LOWER. THEN THE OUR REQUIREMENTS APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR CERTIFIED PEER SUPPORT SPECIALISTS WHICH IS EIGHTY HOURS. RIGHT NOW THE OUR REQUIREMENT FOR REGISTERING AS A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER COUNSELOR IS ONLY NINE HOURS WITH A LIMITED CURRICULUM. THIS MINIMUM STANDARD IS INADEQUATE TO EFFECTIVELY PREPARE INDIVIDUALS TO ENTER A PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND WORK WITH A DIVERSE HIGH NED POPULATION FREQUENTLY WITH COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND LIFE EXPERIENCES. THE PANDEMIC HAS ONLY HEIGHTENED THE NEED TO RE CERTIFICATION STANDARDS AS ALCOHOL AND DRUG RELATED DEATHS HAVE INCREASED AT AN ALARMING RATE TO ENSURE THAT WORKFORCE SHORTAGES AREN'T AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. WE WORKED WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON A SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE A GRANDFATHER CLAUSE FOR ALREADY CERTIFIED COUNSELORS AND A SIX MONTH GRACE PERIOD FOR THOSE BEGINNING THEIR CERTIFICATION PROCESS.

ARE AN INCREASE IN D. WORK FOR STANDARDS FOR REGISTERED COUNSELLORS IN THE FIELD AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY THREE DOES THIS IN TWO WAYS THAT INCREASES THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE NUMBER OF HOURS- AN STD COUNSELOR WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO BECOME REGISTERED- SETS IT AT LEAST AT THE LEVEL OF THE NEW ENTERED BY SB EIGHT THREE FOUR A PEER SPECIALISTS WHICH IS EIGHT HOURS. IT ALSO ENSURES THAT THE CORE COMPETENCY COURSE. REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTER AND CERTIFIED COUNSELORS IS CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL STANDARDS. FOR SUBSTANCE USE ASSESSMENTS DIAGNOSES.

OUT WE CANNOT BE EFFECTIVE ON ANY OF THESE FRONTS WITHOUT A WELL TRAINED AND ROBUST SUBSTANCE USE WORK FORCE- AND SUBSTANCE USE COUNSELORS ARE THE PRIMARY SUBSTANCE USE WORK FORCE- FOR ADDICTION ACROSS THE STATE A TO ENSURE QUALITY SERVICE IS ALSO IMPERATIVE THAT WE- NOT HAVE PEER. SPECIALIST STANDARDS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN SUBSTANCE USE CANCERS PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT SUBSTANCE USE COUNSELORS I PERFORM A BROADER RANGE OF CLINICAL SERVICES I'VE BEEN MANY PEER SPECIALISTS- THIS BILL BALANCES STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS OF ONGOING BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKFORCE SHORTAGES WITH THE NEED FOR- THESE HIGHER STANDARDS AS WELL AS QUALITY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THE ANALYSIS REFLECTS AMENDMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO TAKE SO THAT THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD SO I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THESE AMENDMENTS AND OF FURTHERMORE COMMITTEE TO WORKING CONTINUING WORKING WITH YOU- BEFORE APPROPRIATIONS RELATING TO THE WORKING GROUP ADDED TO THIS BILL- THIS BILL IS STILL REFERRED AND WAS HEARD AN AGING COMMITTEE LAST WEEK AND RECEIVED UNANIMOUS SUPPORT. BILL CREATES THE RESIDENT DESIGNATED SUPPORT PERSONS ACT THIS MEASURE IS A PRODUCT OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC- THE BILL INSURERS ALL RESIDENTS IN NURSING HOMES. OR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES THE RIGHT TO IN PERSON ON SITE AND ON SCHEDULED VISITATION FROM A MINIMUM OF TWO RESIDENT DESIGNATED SUPPORT PERSONS DURING ANY PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN WHICH A RESIDENTS FORMAL VISITATION RIGHTS ARE CURTAILED. SUPPORT PERSONS PROVIDE A CRITICAL AND OFTEN LIFESAVING ROLE IN THE LIVES OF RESIDENTS IN CARE SETTINGS INCLUDING AMONG OTHER THINGS COMPANIONSHIP COGNITIVE STIMULATION. EDUCATION AND DECISION MAKING ASSISTANCE OFTENTIMES THEY PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WITH DAILY LIVING TASKS SUCH AS EATING DRESSING AND HYGIENE. THE PROVIDE MEANINGFUL CONNECTION TRANSPORTATION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THE FULL EXTENT OF THE SUPPORT WAS POORLY UNDER BUT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF YOURS. WHO AUTHORIZED VISITATION LOCKOUTS. IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OR OTHER EMERGENCY SITUATION LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS ARE INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE. OVERSIGHT BODIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM THEIR ORDINARY SUPERVISOR SUPERVISORY FUNCTIONS IN THE CURRENT PANDEMIC SUPPORT PERSONS HAVE OFTEN BEEN BARRED FROM VISITING AT A TIME WHEN RESIDENTS NEEDED THEM THE MOST. DURING THE PANDEMIC THERE WERE A STAGGERING NUMBER OF ALL FACILITY LETTERS PUT OUT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE MAJORITY IMPACTING CARE IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. THE S. S. PUT OUT PROVIDER INFORMATION NOTICES AN EXPONENTIALLY GREATER NUMBERS AS WELL. CARE FACILITIES WERE DEALING WITH COVERT NINETEEN OUTBREAKS INCREASED INFECTION PROTOCOLS STAFFING SHORTAGES AND MORE. AS NURSING HOMES AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES WERE ATTEMPTING TO FOLLOW GUIDELINES SET FORTH BY DPH AND THE SS. THE IMPORTNCE OF IN PERSON VISITATION WAS COMPLETELY FORGOTEN. THE MORBIDITY ASSOCIATED WITH COVERT NINETEEN ISOLATION IS STILL DATA THAT ROOM YET REMAINS ELUSIVE. AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX AUTHORIZES A FACILITY TO REQUIRED DESIGNATED SUPPORT PERSONS TO GREATER INFECTION CONTROL PROTOCOLS REQUIRED OF CARE STAFF DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND ALL INFECTION CONTROL PROTOCOLS MUST BE COMMUNICATED. AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX OUR TONY CHICKEN TELL REPRESENTING KENNER AND DENISE SPOKE ON REPRESENTING THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTER FOR COALITION. PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU GOOD EVENING MY NAME'S TONY TICKET TELL EM SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY FOR CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. AB TWO FIVE FOUR SIX IS ABOUT CORRECTING A MISTAKE A HORRIBLE MISTAKE. MISTAKE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO CLING TO. A MISTAKE IS ASSUMING THAT DESIGNATED SUPPORT PEOPLE ARE NO MORE VALUABLE ARE ARE ARE LESS VALUABLE. THAN THE FACILITIES STAFF. PUBLIC HEALTH OF THIS COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG ABOUT THIS SUPPORT PERSON VISITORS PERFORM MANY OF THE SAME SERVICES. THAT THE SAID THAT FACILITIES STAFF PROVIDED TO KEEP RESIDENTS SAFE AND ALIVE AND THEY BRING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR RESIDENT WELL BEING LOVE. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS WHO NEVER CONSULT WITH ACTUAL RESIDENTS OR THEIR FAMILIES AND CRAFTING THEIR MISGUIDED SUPPORT PERSON LOCKOUTS. SIMPLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT FAMILY MEMBERS BRING. A LONG TERM CARE FACILITY RESIDENTS. IS OFFICIALS ARE COMPLETELY IN CURIOUS ABOUT REAL RESIDENT EXPERIENCES AND HAVE FAILED TO GRASP. THAT SUPPORT PERSON HELP IS NOT A LUXURY IT% IS ESSENTIAL. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR THE AWFUL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES FOR ISOLATING LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS FROM THE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE MOST. I'VE NOT SEEN IT WILL STATE OR LOCAL HEALTH ORDER ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN- TALKED ABOUT THE AFL'S IN THE PENS. THAT ACTUALLY STUCK TO A STUDY A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OR ANY QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. THE ORDERS ARE NOT BASED ON EVIDENCE AND DATA THERE BASED ON HUNCHES AND HOPELESSLY NARROW VIEW OF WHAT SUPPORT PERSONS DO. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS WRONG THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT LOCKDOWNS IN A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THE BILL DOES NOT PREVENT PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES FROM IMPOSING ANY INFECTION CONTROL MEASURES THAT THEY FEEL ARE NECESSARY. WHAT AB TWO FIVE FOUR SIX DOES IS REQUIRE MEASURES AFFECTING DESIGNATED SUPPORT PERSON ACCESS THE APPLIED EQUALLY TO FACILITIES STAFF. AB TWO FIVE FOUR SIX IS NOT ABOUT LIMITING PUBLIC HEALTH IT'S ABOUT EQUAL TREATMENT FOR SUPPORT PERSON VISITORS. RECOGNIZING THAT SUPPORT PERSONS ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT OF THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE RESIDENTS AS THE FACILITIES STAFF. THAT THEY BEGIN THE SAME ACCESS AND IT TO BE POTENTIALLY HELD TO THE SAME RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR INTERACTIONS. GIVING A SUPPORT PERSON THE SAME ACCESS IS A RIGHTEOUS CONCEPT STATES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ARE ADOPTING DESIGNATED SUPPORT PERSON BILLS. IN TEXAS THE 88% OF THE VOTERS AMENDED THEIR CONSTITUTION TO ALLOW FOR SUPPORT PERSON ACCESS. THE COMMITTEE IS PROPOSING A WORKGROUP THAT KICKS THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD FOR ANOTHER YEAR WHILE OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS LIVE WITH THE IN SECURITY. THAT THEIR ABILITY TO RECEIVE LIFE SUSTAINING CARE LOVE MAY BE TAKEN AWAY ON THE WHIMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS. WHO HAVE NEVER SET FOOT NOT ONCE IN A LONG TERM CARE FACILITY IN PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY. THE LEGISLATURE IS A WORKGROUP THE LEGISLATURE IS THE CHECK ON ARBITRARY RULES HANDED DOWN BY THE BUREAUCRATS. IT'S SAD THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IS BEING DELEGATED. AND THAT WILL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR WHERE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE LOCKED OUT AND HAVE TO LOOK WATCH THEIR LOVED ONES DIE. OVER FACETIME. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY DESERT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MISSOURIAN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND FOR HIS STEADFAST COMMITMENT THAT SUPPORT PERSON SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY AS FACILITIES STAFF THANK YOU. GERMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM DENISE BOGAN FROM RIVERSIDE AND I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX. IT'S A HUMAN RIGHT TO BE WITH OUR LOVED ONES. LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS MY MAMA GABBY LEWIS AND MY YOUNG NIECE KELLY SMITH HAD THIS RIGHT TAKEN AWAY. THOUGH THE DETAILS. MAKE THEIR STORY THE HORRORS OF ISOLATION ARE COMMON DINNERS NURSING HOME RESIDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. MOM'S DEMENTIA KEPT HER IN. IN A NURSING HOME PRIOR TO LOCK DOWN HER DAUGHTER'S PARTNERED EVERY DAY WITH THEIR CNA'S TO ASSIST WITH DAILY NEEDS. NURSES GAVE MEDICATIONS BUT WE CLOSELY OBSERVED HER FOR SIDE EFFECTS. MOM ATE VERY LITTLE UNLESS WE WERE THERE TO ENCOURAGE EVERY BITE. ANXIOUS IN THE WE REASSURED HER WITH FAVORITE SONGS AND FAMILY STORIES WE TUCKER IN WITH HER YELLOW AFGHAN AND PLACED HER ROSARY BEADS IN HER HANDS WE WERE HER COMFORT AND HER JOY WE WERE NOT JUST VISITORS ALL OF THIS STOPPED WHEN THE LOCKDOWN WAS IMPOSED ON MARCH THIRTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY SEVERING MOM FROM HER DAUGHTERS WAS DEVASTATING WE WITNESSED MOM'S DAILY SUFFERING THROUGH A FACEBOOK PORTAL. WE WATCHED HELPLESSLY AS MOM DECLINED SHE USE WORDS THAT WE NEVER HEARD CROSSED HER LIPS BEFORE LIKE I'M MISERABLE LOT I'M LONELY IT'S ANOTHER NO NOTHING DAYS SHE WOULD SAY MOM WOULD CRY AND SOMETIMES COMPLETELY WITHDRAW TO SATTAR CONFUSED VIDEO CHAT. THE LOCKDOWN KEPT US OUT BUT NOT CORONAVIRUS STAFF EXPOSED MAMA SHE SUFFERED ALL THAT YOU MIGHT IMAGINE AND ON JANUARY SEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SHE TOOK HER LAST BREATH WHILE HER SIX ADULT CHILDREN WATCHED THROUGH FACEBOOK PORTAL MAMA DIED COMPLETELY ALONE. NO ONE DESERVES THAT. FIVE MONTHS AFTER MOM'S DEATH ANOTHER TRAGEDY MY YOUNG NIECE KELLY SMITH SUFFERED A BRAIN INJURY SHE IS NOW PARALYZED FULLY RELIANT ON LIFE SUPPORT AND RESIDES IN A NURSING HOME. SHE WAS THOUGHT TO BE MENTALLY INCOMPETENT AND UNCOMMUNICATIVE BY DOCTORS AND STAFF THAT IS UNTIL HER LOVED ONES WERE ALLOWED TO BE WITH HER AWARE OF EVERYTHING GOING ON WE CURRENTLY WORK WITH HEARD DAY IN AND DAY AND NIGHT DILIGENTLY. KELLY NEEDS US SHE COMMUNICATES TO THE WORLD THROUGH US. REALLY IS BEEN HOSPITALIZED SEVERAL TIMES DURING HER NURSING HOME STAY DUE TO COMPLICATIONS. IT IS HER LOVED ONES THAT I'VE NOTICED CHANGES IN KELLY AND HAVE BROUGHT IT TO THE MEDICAL STAFF EVERY TIME ONCE AGAIN WE'RE NOT JUST VISITORS WERE ESSENTIAL CARE GIVERS. KELLY LIKE MY MOM HAS ALSO BEEN DENIED ACCESS TO US EVERY CHANGING INFECTION CONTROL PROTOCOLS HAVE KEPT US AT BAY WE HAD TO PURCHASE OUR OWN COLBY TESTS AT TIMES. THE INEQUITIES ITS ACT OF EXPECTATIONS BETWEEN US AND STAFF WERE GLARING AT TIMES REQUIRED TO WEAR FULL PP WE OFTEN SAW REPAIR MEN GO IN AND OUT OF THE BUILDING WITHOUT ANYTHING. WEARING GLOVES TO HOLD KELLY'S HAND I OFTEN WATCH STAFF TOO BUSY AND TOO WEARY TO PUT THEIR GLOVES ON. EIGHT TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX- THAT BOULDER AND TERM CARE ALWAYS MAINTAIN THEIR HUMAN RIGHT TO BE CARED FOR BY FAMILY. AS A CENTRAL CARE GIVERS OUR GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF OUR LOVED ONES AS IS THE GOAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. ARE SUPPORT SHOULD BE WELCOMED WE POSED LESS INFECTION RISK THEN THEN STAFF BECAUSE WE TAKE THE SAME PRECAUTIONS BUT ONLY SPEND TIME WITH ONE RESIDENT. IN HONOR OF MY MOM GABBY LEWIS AND MY NIECE KELLY SMITH PLEASE SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX SO MUCH SUFFERING AND DEATH CAN BE AVOIDED. TO THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

ARE THEY CITY OF REDONDO BEACH HAS SIX A LAUNCHED A SUCCESSFUL HOMELESS COURT PROGRAM WHERE THEY PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SERVICES INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR A CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS THAT- HAVE. BEEN CHARGED WITH- WITH MINOR OF QUALITY OF LIFE- IT TYPE CRIMES- BUT- WE KNOW THAT- THIS IS NOT A NEW PROGRAM WE KNOW THAT TO AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY THERE IS A ALSO A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL HOMELESS COURT PROGRAM. A SAN DIEGO WAS ONE OF THE FIRST IN THE STATE TO ESTABLISH THIS. AND SO- BUT WITH THIS TRACK RECORD THE CHIEF JUSTICE IS WORKING GROUP ON HOMELESSNESS AS RECOMMENDED IN FACT THIS HOMELESS COURT A PILOT PROGRAM TO BE FUNDED. A WITH ME- HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS A MICHAEL WEBB CITY ATTORNEY OF THE CITY OF REDONDO BEACH WHO HAS SPEARHEADED THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IN REDONDO BEACH.

PROSECUTOR AND PUBLIC DEFENDER SIDE BY SIDE IN SUPPORT OF THE HOMELESS COURT PROGRAM. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WEDDING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TIFFANY SENATE I AM A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS. MAY SUPERVISE SOME OF OUR PUBLIC DEFENDER PROGRAMS HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. AN INTERSECTION EXISTS BETWEEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND HOMELESSNESS AND TWENTY NINETEEN SACRAMENTO COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE FOUND. THAT WERE UN HOUSED A SECONDARY STUDY IN TWENTY NINETEEN FOUND THAT FIFTY PERCENT. OF A MISDEMEANOR MENTAL HEALTH DIVERT. FUNDS WERE ALSO AND HOUSED IN 99% LIVED IN QUALIFIED OPPORTUNITY ZONES. RECOGNIZING THIS INTERSECTION IN A NEED TO LINK OUR CLIENTS WHO SUPPORTED SERVICES. WE DEVELOPED A PRE TRIAL SUPPORT PROGRAM WITH OLIVER JUSTICE PARTNERS SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES SUPERIOR COURT AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. OVER THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE USE LAW STUDENTS TO GO INTO CUSTODY AND ASSESS OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE USING AND FOR EVIDENCE BASED TOOLS TO IDENTIFY THEIR NEEDS WHAT WE FOUND WAS THIS. 51% OF THE PEOPLE IN CUSTODY NEEDED MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT 43% NEEDED SUBSTANCE USE SUPPORT 46% NEEDED HOUSING SUPPORT IN 83% NEEDED FOLLOW UP WITH THE SOCIAL WORKER BILLION CLIENTS TO OUR PUBLIC DEFENDERS SOCIAL WORKER TEAM. WITH TO POSTAL WORKERS A HANDFUL OF SOCIAL WORKER AND LAW STUDENT INTERNS AN IMMENSE COLLABORATION FORMER SUPERIOR COURT JUSTICE PARTNERS AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES TOGETHER WE LINK TO FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO INDIVIDUALS TO MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT.

THIS YEAR WE HAVE ALSO RECALLED WARRANTS AND OVER THREE HUNDRED INFRACTIONS CHANGING FINES AND FEES TO COMMUNITY SERVICE ROB MOBILE LEGAL HOMELESS CLINIC. WE'VE SUPPORTED OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND HOUSE CLIENTS WITH RECORD MODIFICATION SO THAT WE CAN REMOVE THE BARRIERS THESE CONVICTIONS GREAT FOR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND HOUSING. ADDITIONALLY WE OPEN UP A ONE STOP SHOP WITH PARTNERS SO THAT SERVICES CAN BE FOUND ONE RULE FOR A MISDEMEANOR MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION. WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED THROUGH ALL OF THIS IS THAT THERE IS AN INTERSECTION BETWEEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND HOMELESSNESS. BUT WITH HOLISTIC MULTI PRONGED MULTI SYSTEMIC APPROACH WE CAN CHANGE LIVES WE CAN IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE CAN HELP SUPPORT THIS STATE AND ARE HOMELESS CRISIS. THANK YOU. PLEASE GO AHEAD THANKS THANK YOU CHAIR WOULD IN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE WELL BEHIND THE CITY ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF REDONDO BEACH. IN MY THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF WORKING IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING WHERE THE INTEREST OF EVERYONE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ALIGN DEFENDANT'S DEFENSE ATTORNEYS PROSECUTORS IN THE COMMUNITY. MEMBERS ARE ALL- SEEKING THE SAME GOAL WHICH IS TO REMOVE AS MANY OF THE OBSTACLES PREVENTING THE ON HOUSE FROM. PEENING HOUSING. IN THE DIFFICULTY IN CALIFORNIA IS THERE ARE SO MANY PROGRAMS THAT WORK IN SILENCE IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANNOUNCED INDIVIDUAL NOT ONLY IS ON HOUSE BUT WE MAY BE SUFFERING FROM OF ONE OR MORE ISSUES WHETHER IT BE MENTAL HEALTH FOR DRUG ADDICTION TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH- THROUGH THE SYSTEM. ARE- THE APPROACH TO ALMOST COURT IS WE MOVED OUTDOORS AND WE ORIGINALLY DID IT BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC BUT WHAT WE QUICKLY LEARNED WAS THAT BY BRINGING THE JUSTICE SYSTEM INTO THE COMMUNITY NEAR WHERE THEY ON HOUSE ALREADY WERE WE HAD BETTER RESULTS IT WAS AA IT'S A COURT BUT IT'S A COURT IN A PARKING LOT IN ITS AGREE AND IT'S A SITUATION WHERE. IT'S- LESS THREATENING AND WE BRING ALL THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND WE'RE ADDING MORE EVERY DAY. TO MAKE THE PERSON NOT GIVE FIVE REFERENCES OF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO THIS EVERYTHING'S RIGHT THERE ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELLING DRUG ADDICTION DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH- THAT JOB PLACEMENT FOR THE PEOPLE AS THEY PROGRESS THROUGH SO WE'RE- TRYING TO SET THEM UP FOR SUCCESS. AND THAT'S WHY YOU THINK BY ELIMINATING THE SILOS WHY IT WORKS SO WELL AND WHY EVERYBODY IS SO. SUPPORTIVE OF IT- WE'RE A SMALLER CITY BUT WE'RE FULL SERVICE WE HAVE OUR OWN PROSECUTION POLICE FIRE HOUSING AUTHORITY SO WE'RE GOOD- SMALLER MODEL TO PILOT IT'S NOW BEING TESTED IN A TORRANCE OUR LARGEST NEIGHBOUR IN LONG BEACH THE SECOND LARGEST CITY. IN LA I THINK THIS I FULLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT WOULD ENABLE THAT SORT OF PUBLIC PROJECT HE BE ADOPTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE FOUND THAT OURS IS PRE PLEA BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO ENTER A GUILTY PLEA AND WE FOUND THAT. OVER 71% OF THE PEOPLE REFERRED SHOW UP AND ACCEPT SERVICES. AND IN A STUNNING STATISTIC THE AMOUNT OF DEFENDANTS WHO ARE ENCOUNTERED THAT SHOW UP. IS AT A LOW OF EIGHTY PERCENT. SOMETIMES IS A ANY SORT OF COURT PROCEEDINGS SO- WE'RE SETTING THEM UP FOR SUCCESS IT WOULD BE A GREAT MODEL TO TRY AND BRING ALL THE SERVICES. IN ONE PLACE AND I THANK YOU.

AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTEEN WOULD ESTABLISH A LICENSING PATH AND ENSURE MUCH NEEDED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR CHILDREN CRISIS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS. CURRENTLY AN ESTIMATED THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR CHILDREN IN THE U. S. WHO NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DO NOT RECEIVE THEM. SUICIDE IS NOW THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG ADOLESCENTS. FORTY SEVEN OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE NO CHILD PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL INPATIENT BEDS FOR CHILDREN UNDER TWELVE. ON THE HEELS OF THE US SURGEON GENERAL'S DIRE WARNING ABOUT THE GROWING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AMONG YOU. WHICH HAS WORSENED DUE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. CRUCIAL MENTAL HEALTH REFORM IS NEEDED.

WITH THE APPROPRIATE LICENSING CATEGORIES ESTABLISHED THE STATE AND COUNTIES WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE CONTINUUM OF MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE OUT EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS ENTRY. WHICH IS A FEDERAL AND A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH SECRETARY GOLLY AS WE HAD A CONVERSATION ON THURSDAY OF LAST WEEK TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS- IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND- TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A BILL THAT THAT REALLY- SUFFICES IN AND- MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

OUR MEMBERS ARE SERVING SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM. AND THEY'RE SEEING HIGHER ACUITY AND MORE INTENSE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS THAN EVER BEFORE WHERE THE PROUD SPONSOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE SEVENTEEN. THIS BILL WOULD ADD A NEW LICENSURE CATEGORY CALLED THE PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY OR THE P. R. T. F. SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING CHILDREN'S CRISIS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE CRITICALLY NEEDED TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY HOSPITALIZATIONS ENABLE CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN A TIMELY MANNER. ESTABLISHING A NEW LICENSURE CATEGORY IS NECESSARY FOR COUNTIES AND COMMUNITY BASED AGENCIES. TO DEVELOP THE SHORT TERM CRISIS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS THE NEED EXISTED WELL BEFORE THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND CONTINUES TO BE EVEN MORE NEEDED NOW. IN A STUDY OF CRISIS SERVICES PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. HIGHLIGHTED THAT FORTY THOUSAND CHILDREN WERE BEING HOSPITALIZED EVERY YEAR. AND THE SAME STUDY IDENTIFIED JUST SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR BEDS AVAILABLE FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS STATEWIDE- AS MISTER RAMOS STATED WE- SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE CHAI AND THE STAFF- TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THIS BILL AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH.

GOOD EVENING MISTER TURN MEMBERS AMY BLOOMBERG ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RUNS HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION CCHA REPRESENTS THE EIGHT PRIVATE NONPROFIT FREESTANDING CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS IN THE STATE'S APPROXIMATELY 62% OF OUR PATIENTS ARE ON MEDICAID. AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTEEN RECENTLY CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS HAVE SEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE AND PEDIATRIC PATIENTS IN PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS FOR EXAMPLE FROM 202-120-2220 TWENTY ONE AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF ORANGE COUNTY OR CHALK. THERE WAS A 27% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF KIDS PRESENTING TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND JUST THE FIRST SEVEN MONTHS OF THIS FISCAL YEAR THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER 24% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS IN CRISIS PRESENTING AT THE E. D. THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN BEING HOSPITALISED FOR EATING DISORDERS IS ALSO VERY ALARMING. FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT SHOCKED THERE WAS A HUNDRED AND 8% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN BEING HOSPITALISED FOR EATING DISORDERS. AND THIS YEAR'S CASES ARE KEEPING PACE FOR ANOTHER OVERALL IN THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS CHOCK HAS SEEN A FOUR HUNDRED AND 50% INCREASE OF CHILDREN BEING HOSPITALISED FOR EATING DISORDERS. THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS OF HOW TO ADDRESS THE SURGE AND- DEATRICH PSYCHIATRIC NEEDS AND CRISIS RESIDENTIAL SERVICES ARE A RESOURCE THAT CAN HELP. MANY OF THE CHILDREN ARRIVING IN THE E. R. COULD BE TREATED MORE EFFECTIVELY IN A RESIDENTIAL SETTING PROVIDING QUALITY AND SAFE CARE AND ALSO RESERVING THE LIMITED INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC BEDS FOR THE KIDS THAT NEED IT MOST. ACCESS TO CRISIS RESIDENTIAL BEDS IF AN EFFECTIVE DISCHARGE ACTION FOR PATIENTS THAT REQUIRED INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION RIGHT NOW MANY COMMERCIAL INJURED PATIENTS HAVE THIS AS AN OPTION THAT IS USE REGULARLY WHEN STEPPING DOWN TO ONCE A WEEK OR ONCE A MONTH THERAPY IS TOO BIG OF A DROP. UNFORTUNATELY ACCESS RESIDENTS THIS IS BEDS IS NOT COVERED FOR MEDICAL PATIENTS FOR THESE KIDS THE MAIN OPTION IS GOING TO FROM TWENTY FOUR HOUR SUPERVISION AND A LOCKED IN PATIENT UNITS BEING A THERAPIST EVERY FEW WEEKS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS NOT SUCCESSFUL FOR MANY PATIENTS AND- RETURNING TO THE ER OR IMPATIENCE THANK YOU TRICK UNIT.

ARE PROGRAM BLACK MOTHERS UNITED FUNDED FOR OVER EIGHT YEARS BY FIRST FIVE SACRAMENTO IS MODELED ON C. P. S. P. AND RELIES ON THE SERVICES OF PREGNANCY COACHES TO ASSIST CLIENTS DURING PREGNANCY THREE FOUR MONTHS POSTPARTUM IN THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITY. OUR ABILITY TO MEET CLIENT'S WHERE THEY'RE OUT OUTSIDE OF THE CLIP ALLOWS OUR TEAM TO BUILD XIN SHIPS BASED ON TRUST AND EMPOWERMENT LEVERAGING C. P. S. B. TOOLS LIKE THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT WE HAVE DEVELOPED A ROBUST DATABASE AND THROUGH INDEPENDENT EVALUATION THE FOLLOWING ARE JUST A COUPLE OF THE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT OUTCOMES THAT WE ARE SEEING. ONE REPORTED NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES DECREASED FROM 20% AT PROGRAM INTAKE 26% AT FOLLOW UP. AND MATERNAL DEPRESSION AS INDICATED BY THE PH Q. NINE ASSESSMENT WAS RATED MODERATE OR HIGH IN 30% OF MOTHERS BEFORE ENTERING THE PROGRAM. AND AFTER PROGRAM COMPLETION ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS POSTPARTUM VERSUS SIXTY DAYS POSTPARTUM BSE PSP. THIS PERCENTAGE HAS DECREASED 211% SIXTY DAYS POSTPARTUM IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH WE KNOW THAT POST PARTUM MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS DO NOT OFTEN DISPLAY IMMEDIATELY AFTER BIRTH AND CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT INDIVIDUALS THROUGH ONE YEAR POSTPARTUM WITH NO OPPORTUNITY FOR SCREENINGS OR SUPPORT. ADDITIONALLY THIS EXPANSION WOULD ALLOW PROVIDERS REIMBURSEMENT FOR ONGOING LACTATION SUPPORT ASSISTING PARENTS IN BREASTFEEDING LONGER IMPROVING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR BIRTHING PEOPLE AND DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES FOR THE BABY. ADDITIONALLY IT WOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY SUPPORTS TO ENSURE THAT THE INFANT IS CONNECTED TO THEIR PEDIATRICIAN RECEIVING REGULAR WELL CHILD CHECKS VACCINATIONS AND DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS IF NOT FOR GRANT RELIANT PROGRAMS LIKE BLACK MOTHERS UNITED WHERE ELSE WOULD OUR FAMILIES GO TO RECEIVE THE SUPPORTS IT SHOULD BE A PART OF MEDIC CAL. GIVEN THE OUTCOMES THAT WE ARE SEEING WITHIN OUR PROGRAM IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE C. P. S. P. BENEFIT BE EXPANDED AT A MINIMUM TO FOUR MONTHS POSTPARTUM HOWEVER CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL IMPACT WE WOULD SEE IF THE BENEFIT WAS EXPANDED TO SUPPORT. OUR FAMILY THEN BABIES THROUGHOUT THE FIRST YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION RESEARCH THERE'S NO RESEARCH OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SO- OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

TWENTY THREE SIXTY WILL HELP REDUCE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN FUTURE RECOVERY RESPONSE AND REPAIR EFFORTS FOLLOWING STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCIES. COBIT NINETEEN REVEALED THE CRACKS IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEIR DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. OUR LACK OF A COMPREHENSIVE AND COLLABORATIVE EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM OF CARE EXACERBATED THE INEQUITIES AND DISPROPORTIONATE ALITY THAT HISTORICALLY DISINVEST DID COMMUNITIES FACED. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY WILL PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF EMERGENCY FUNDS MOVING FORWARD. BY EVALUATING WHERE CALIFORNIA EXCELLED AND WHERE IT FELL SHORT IN SUPPORTING DISADVANTAGED DIS INVESTED COMMUNITIES THE RECOMMENDATIONS DEVELOPED BY THE WORKING GROUP THIS BILL ESTABLISHES WILL DRAFT A MORE EQUITABLE RESPONSE TO FUTURE EMERGENCIES. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY ARE THE PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES AND ALLOW THEM TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS A SOME APPLIED THEN THE DIRECTOR OF STATE POLICY A PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES. TOGETHER WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER DR ARAMBULA WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE SIXTY WHICH WILL PROVIDE A STRATEGY TO PLAN ALLOCATE AND EXECUTE THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF FUTURE EMERGENCY FUNDING. TWO YEARS INTO THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC DATA REVEALS THE PANDEMIC HAS DONE IMMENSE HARM AND HAS IT HAD AN UNEQUAL IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. LIKE THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE AND RECOVERY EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE ALSO BEEN ON EQUAL. WE KNEW GOING INTO THE PANDEMIC WHO WOULD BEIMPACTED BECAUSE WE WERE AWARE OF THE EXISTING HEALTH AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES RESPONSE SYSTEMS WERE NOT PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGES THAT KOBE NINETEEN PRODUCED THE PANDEMIC HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE. THE PANDEMIC ALSO REVEALED SIGNIFICANT CRACKS IN THIS CRITICAL SYSTEM. THESE LESSONS LEARNED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS HAVE TAUGHT US THAT WE NEED TO PREPARE NOW. FOR THE NEXT EMERGENCY. OUR GOAL GOAL THROUGH A B. TWENTY THREE SIXTY IS TO BRING TOGETHER KEY STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS TO DEVELOP TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS FOR THE ALLOCATION OF FUTURE EMERGENCY FUNDING. TO REDUCE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN RECOVERY RESPONSE AND REPAIR EFFORTS. THE WORK GROUP CREATED BY AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY WILL CREATE A PLAN FOR ALLOCATING FUNDING DURING EMERGENCIES THAT WILL COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR APPROVAL. THE PLAN WILL CREATE THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE BY PREPARING NOW FOR FUTURE CRISES WITH THE RACE CONSCIOUS LANDS AND COMMUNITY DRIVEN APPROACHES. TO PUT OUR MOST HISTORICALLY DISINVEST THE COMMUNITIES FIRST. BUILDING RESILIENT COMMUNITIES BY MAKING SMART AND SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS BASED ON THE EXISTING NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND ESTABLISHING RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY BY PARK LEAD AND SERVING ORGANIZATIONS BEFORE EMERGENCIES HAPPEN. FINALLY I KNOW THAT PEOPLE DID THE BEST THAT THEY COULD TO RESPOND TO THE PANDEMIC. THIS WAS AN OVERWHELMING TASK FOR ALL OF US AND ALL OF OUR STATE AND LOCAL SYSTEMS HOWEVER. WE HAVE LEARNED LESSONS FROM OUR SUCCESSES AND OUR FAILURES WE MUST USE THESE LESSONS TO CREATE AN EMERGENCY FUNDING STRATEGY THAT BETTER SERVES OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE FAIL TO DO SO EACH FUTURE EMERGENCY WILL CREATE DEEPER DISPARITIES THAT WILL BE EVEN HARDER TO ADDRESS. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY AND STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- OTHERS IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO MIGHT WISH THIS EXPRESSIVE PORTER OPPOSITION- PLEASE COME FORWARD YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION POSITION ON THE BILL.
