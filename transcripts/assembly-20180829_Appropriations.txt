ON TWO POINTS AND THEY'RE BOTH RELATED TO THAT. FISCAL REALITIES OF THE BILL MEASURE IS ESTABLISHING A BROAD NEW STATEWIDE. A PROGRAM FOR TAKE BACKS AND WE'RE THE ODD PARTICIPANT -- OUT IN THE PROCESS THERE'S NO DEFINED PROCESS IN THE MEASURE AS TO HOW. THE ALLOCATION OF THE COST WILL BE AND ALLOCATED AND IN OTHER STATES AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- IT'S BEEN ALLOCATED BY VOLUME -- THE GENERICS PROVIDE A 90% OF THE VOLUME RATHER THAN REVENUE WHERE WE ONLY CREATE. A RECEIVE 27% OF THE REVENUE AND YET WE SAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. FOR OUR CONSUMERS AND I HEALTHCARE COSTS AND WE THINK THAT -- THE BILL NEEDS TO BROADEN OUR WHO IS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN SUBJECT. TO THE FEE -- REIMBURSEMENTS AND THEN ALSO BE CLEAR AS TO THE ALLOCATION PROCESS FOR HOW THE FEES TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM -- WILL BE ADMINISTERED ARE FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YEAR ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO FILE.

WELL YES FIRST OF ALL THERE'S NO FEE LISTED IN THE BILL AND WE'RE LEAVING IT TO THE INDUSTRY -- TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY WANT TO GO ABOUT PAYING FOR THIS. AS GOOD AS A WAY TO GIVE THEM THEY WANT THAT CREATIVE OPPORTUNITY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE BILL WE BASICALLY SAID. HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT AND THAT HAS MET WITH APPROVAL OF ALL OF THEM I WOULD INDICATE TO THAT THE COST IS AND I KNOW WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION I HOPE SOMEBODY GOT YOU THE ANSWER. IS UP LESS THAN HALF A CENT FOR EVERY TEN DOLLARS. HE'S AT THE HALF A CENT FOR EVERY TEN DOLLARS OF LIST PRICE OF THE DRUG [inaudible] IT'S MAINLY. WE'LL TAKE THAT IS YOUR CLOTHES. I'VE JUST RESPECT OF THIS THIS A BILL WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A NUMBER YEARS. UP WE DO THIS OR WE'RE GOING TO FIND HUNDREDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES DOING THEIR OWN TAKE BACKS WHICH IS GOING TO CREATE ABSOLUTE HAVOC. THIS IS A SYSTEM WHERE IT COUNTS RECYCLES GONNA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IT'S GOING TO BE PAID FOR BY THE INDUSTRY EVERYONE'S IN AGREEMENT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A GROUP THAT'S CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO COST THEM.

THANK YOU MISTER ACCENT YOU WILL PROCEED WITH. FOR SIXTY FIVE AS BEFORE SIXTY FIVE THIS ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. UP MOVE DEVELOPMENT MOTION BY. DOCTOR QUIRK A SECOND BY MISS CARILLO. SO TRY TO BE BRIEF ON THIS. WERE TRYING TO DO WITH OUR WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA MANY OF US HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE IN OUR DISTRICT I HAD THE TOMS FIRE. IN MINE WE LOST TWENTY THREE PEOPLE OF THE FIRES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES CONTINUE TO BURN WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO TO TRY TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WHILE WE TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE THINNING THE FOREST AND CONTROLLED BURNS SAN. DEFENSIBLE SPACE ONE OF THE OTHER ITEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT QUITE A BIT IS HARDENING OF NOT ONLY THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR UTILITY COMPANIES BUT HARDENING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR HOMES. AND THAT WE KNOW IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT RIGHT NOW WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY RECOURSE TO DOING THAT EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THINGS LIKE GETTING RID OF THATCHED ROOF SO. I END DOUBLE PAINTING WINDOWS ARE JUST SIMPLE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO PROTECT OUR HOMES BETTER FROM THE SITUATIONS AS THESE HOT AND A WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY FIRES CHOI UNITIES. THE PACE PROGRAM ACTUALLY HAS SOME MONEY NOW I UNDERSTAND. A APPARENTLY THERE IS A LOT OF CONSTERNATION ABOUT THAT PROGRAM AND AYE I DON'T QUARREL WITH THAT THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY. A ATTACHED TO A ASSEMBLY MEMBER AYE WE ARE CARREY'S REFORM BILL. UP BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S MONEY AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PACE PROGRAM WE ARE GOING TO ADD THIS OF HARDENING HOMES TO THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OR I SHOULD SAY TO THE MONEY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PACE PROGRAM. FOR THIS HARDENING PROCESS WE'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS THAT LIMIT -- HOW WE CAN BE USED WHERE CAN BE USED THIS IS KEY TO OUR PARTICULARLY ARE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT CANNOT OTHERWISE AFFORD TO DO SOME OF THIS HARDENING WE DON'T WANT THEM TO LOSE THEIR HOMES NOBODY? CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THEIR HOMES THIS IS ONE ELEMENT IN THIS BATTLE AGAINST THE CHANGING CLIMATE THE WILDFIRES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE STATE.
