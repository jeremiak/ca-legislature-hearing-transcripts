WORK AT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL SCALE ON PLANNING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSPORTATION AND OVER THE LAST TWELVE YEARS FOCUSED ON STRATEGIES TO CONSERVE AND MANAGE OUR NOT RESOURCE. SUCH THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THESE RESOURCES PROVIDE. BUT ALSO ENHANCE THE ECONOMIC VALUE FROM THE INDUSTRIES AND THE JOBS THAT RELY ON AND UTILIZE THESE RESOURCES. AND FURTHER MORE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT THESE BENEFITS ARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THOSE LIVING IN BOTH RURAL AND URBAN PARTS OF OUR STATE. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR ENVIRONMENT HAS INHERENT RISKS AND HAZARDS THAT WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR. OUR CHALLENGE AND OUR OPPORTUNITY IS TO ENSURE RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP OF OUR RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR STATE TODAY BUT ALSO FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION'S MISSION. AND IT'S ALSO THE COMBINATION OF MY PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND PASSION. MY VISION FOR THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT REQUIRED NEW PROGRAMS OR A MAJOR REORGANIZATION. RATHER A NEW WAY OF LOOKING AT OUR PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS IN TERMS OF THE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS DIRECTIVES OF THE GOVERNOR. SECRETARY PRO CLINTON LEGISLATURE. THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION HAS A UNIQUE COLLECTION OF DIVISIONS THAT ENCOMPASS BOTH THE SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE ASPECTS OF NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS.

I JUST SO YEAH I GET AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS I JUST I'VE GOT JUST ONE QUESTION FOR YOU- AS YOU KNOW ABOUT 70% OF THE OF THE OIL DEMAND FOR CALIFORNIANS COMES FROM ELSEWHERE IN MOST AFTER THE MIDDLE EAST AND COURSE IF YOU YOU SEE PICTURES ON THE COAST HAS BEEN- JUST. THIS YEAR JUST A MASSIVE YEAR FOR THESE OIL SUPERTANKERS OFF THE COAST IS THERE ANY IS THERE ANY ROLE FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT TO PLAY. INTO ENSURING THAT WE'RE NOT THAT WE DON'T BECOME MORE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL THAT DOESN'T REALLY FALL INTO THE DEPARTMENT CONSERVATIONS ROLE- BE THERE ARE STUDIES UNDER WAY CURRENTLY- AT CALIFORNIA. A LOOKING AT- THE FUTURE AND TOWARD- OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND CHANGES. IN THE MARKETPLACE. REALLY ARE OUR ROLE IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IS TO IMPLEMENT THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND TO DO THAT TO THAT THE LETTER LAWS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. INCISION IN SINCE YOU'VE BEEN THERE- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ON TERMS INCREASING COLLABORATION BETWEEN BECAUSE YOU GOT BASICALLY FOUR PILLARS OF RESPONSIBILITY HAVE YOU HAVE YOU. TAKE ANY ACTIONS TO INCREASE AND IMPROVE THAT COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION OR WAS IT ALREADY GOOD WHEN YOU GOT THERE. YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO WE DO HAVE FOUR DIVISIONS AND- I THINK OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE LOOK AT THOSE DIVISIONS AND THINK THAT THEY REALLY ARE JUST SEPARATE AND THEY DO SEPARATE THINGS BUT BUT MY VIEW OF OUR FOUR DIVISIONS ACT WE- WE ARE TACKLING. MANY UP THE ACTUAL WORKING LANDS CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FROM FROM MAYBE FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES BUT WE'RE ALL AIMING TOWARDS THE SAME GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND SO IN IN LOOKING AT THAT AND KIND OF TAKING A STEP BACK AND- AT. THE THAT WE HAVE WITHIN EACH OF OUR DIVISIONS AND THE PROGRAM'S HIGH END SCENE WHERE THERE'S REALLY SYNERGY BETWEEN THOSE AND- I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF SYNERGY BETWEEN THOSE THOSE DIVISIONS. ARE BECAUSE WE ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS NATURAL WORKING LAND TO CALIFORNIA IN DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THOSE WHO PUT THEM TOGETHER WERE MORE COMPETITION SOME. HIGH LEVEL GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT BY THE GOVERNOR BY THE SECRETARY- AND WE SEE OURSELVES. IN A CENTRAL ROLE IN MANY OF THOSE ASPECTS GREAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS AGAIN HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

THERE WERE A LARGE NUMBER OF PERMITS ISSUED APPARENTLY- PRIOR TO THAT. TRANSITION OF LEADERSHIP. LINKING THAT OVERSIGHT TO COUNTY M. ANA TO OIL EXTRACTION FRACKING HOW HIS COVERT NINETEEN IMPACTED. THE DIVISION'S ABILITY TO MONITOR AND PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER TO IT YOU KNOW IT REALLY HAS NOT WE WERE ABLE TO TRANSITION FAIRLY SEAMLESSLY FROM OFFICE TO DO HOMEWORK TO OUR VIRTUAL WORK ENVIRONMENTS- AND SO WE DIDN'T REALLY MISS A BEAT AND- ALL OF THE WORK THAT WE DO TO OVERSEE- THAT THE REGULATIONS APPLY TO THE INDUSTRY- AND SO I WOULD SAY JUST IN SHORT ACT YOU KNOW KOBE IT IS ACTUALLY- HASN'T REALLY INTERRUPTED OUR OUR OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR CONNECTIONS AND IN FACT WE FOUND WAYS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT IN THIS VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. AND TO START PILOTING NEW IDEAS AND METHODS FOR HOW TO DO OUR WORK. GREAT WELL THANK YOU. AND THEN THE OTHER AREA WE DISCUSSED THAT I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN IS THE CALIFORNIA GEOLOGIC SURVEY THE- SIZE MAKE- MONITORING AND COLLABORATION AMONG. DIFFERENT PARTNERS- AND THEN THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SHAKE ALERT- AS PEOPLE SAY YOU CAN'T PREDICT AN EARTHQUAKE BUT THERE CAN THERE'S TECHNOLOGY FOR EARLY. AWARENESS OF GROUND MOVEMENT COULD YOU JUST GIVE US A QUICK UPDATE THE STATUS OF SHAKE ALERT AND HOW MUCH OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS. PROTECTED BY THAT IF AT ALL AT THIS STAGE. YES WILL WE CONTINUE TO DEPLOY OUR SENSORS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- CONCENTRATING ON AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO SEE MORE SEISMIC ACTIVITY ON A REGULAR BASIS- AND WORKING OUT FROM THERE YOU KNOW OUR OUR WORK IS RATHER ENDLESS I WOULD HAVE TO SAY BECAUSE CAL. IS RATHER ACTIVE SO WE ARE WE ARE DOING THE BEST THAT WE CAN DO TO GET- SENSORS OUT IN THE FIELD- GET THOSE OUT OF SYNC DEVON LINKED INTO A CENTRAL SYSTEM- AND GET THAT INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- YOU KNOW THE DATA YOU'RE RIGHT WE CANNOT PREDICT EARTHQUAKES BUT WE'RE GETTING BETTER AND THE INFORMATION IS MOVING FASTER OUT TO THE PUBLIC SO THAT THEY ARE ALERTED WHEN SOMETHING STARTS TO HAPPEN- AND TRYING TO GIVE THEM THAT THE VALUABLE SECONDS THAT THEY NEED TO. ADAM DOWN AND COVER OR THERE'S- AND SO I WE CONTINUE TO CHIP AWAY AT THAT- AND AS I MENTIONED WE ARE WE ARE DOING% OUR BEST WITH WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE.

ACCORDING I WILL PULLING A RESEARCH TOGETHER AND AGAIN IN. THE SPEED AT WHICH WE GET FOR. OUT TO THE PUBLIC. THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT NINE NOW. AS CALIFORNIANS WE KNOW IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY'LL BE. FUTURE SEISMIC EVENTS THE QUESTION IS WHEN IN TERMS OF ONES THAT MAY BE. DISASTROUS IN PROPORTION AND I THINK ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE EARLY SENSOR IS TO POTENTIALLY PROTECT PEOPLE FROM BEING CAUGHT IN ELEVATORS OR TO STOP ON. TRANSIT SYSTEMS ALL DESIGNED TO PROTECT PEOPLE WITH EVEN A FEW SECONDS OF WARNING IN AN I KNOW FUNDING IS AN ISSUE BUT I HOPE YOU. THREE YEAR DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE PROGRESS OF THAT WORK AND- HOW RESOURCES FUTURE RESOURCES MIGHT HELP FURTHER DEVELOP THAT AND- I'LL JUST CLOSE BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR CAREER PUBLIC SERVICE IN.

TO MY FAMILY OF CHOICE I HAVE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE. AND I HAVE CHOSEN WELL AND I HOPE YOU ALL KNOW HOW GRATEFUL I AM. I WANT TO THANK MY FAMILY LENORA HALL ALISON LESLIE CARTER AND O'MARA. BUT SPECIAL THING THIS GOES TO MY PARENTS. MY FATHER WAS A CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR AND MY MOTHER TAUGHT. HELLO BLACK STUDIES AND POLITICAL SCIENCE IN MY WORK PUTS ME SQUARELY BETWEEN THOSE TWO REALMS ALTHOUGH MY FATHER HAS PASSED. AS YOU CAN SEE MY MOTHER CONTINUES TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT. AS WITH ALL APPOINTMENTS THAT COME BEFORE YOU THIS POSITION IS A GREAT DEAL OF RESPONSIBILITY. YOU ARE ALL AWARE OF DTS HE'S CHALLENGES. WE WORKING THE KERRY DISPROPORTIONATE POLLUTION BURDENS AND EXPERIENCE ECONOMIC DISPARITIES. THEIR SUFFERING HAS BEEN MADE EVEN WORSE BY COVERT NINETEEN. I'VE HEARD FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO CONTINUE TO DIE OUT THE DEPARTMENT'S COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING INEQUITIES. I WANT. YOU TO KNOW THAT I TAKE THESE CONCERNS VERY SERIOUSLY. AS DOES THEGOVERNOR. AS DOES THE SECRETARY HAPPENED DOES US AND AS THOSE ARE STAFF. YEAH I TAKE IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THE TNC. FIRST AND FOREMOST I BELIEVE IN OUR MISSION TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA FROM THE IMPACTS OF PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE EXPOSURES TO HARMFUL CHEMICALS. I BELIEVE IN OUR STAFF WERE. WRONGLY COMMITTED TO THAT MISSION. AND I BELIEVE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO HELPING DGSE MEET THAT MISSION ESPECIALLY SECRETARY BLUMENFELD. AND LASTLY I BELIEVE BASED ON MY INTERACTIONS THAT A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS ARE ALSO PASSIONATELY COMMITTED TO THAT MISSION. I WANT TO SEE US FULFILL THAT MISSION BY TELLING PEOPLE WHAT WE PLAN TO DO AND THEN DOING. I WANT US TO FURTHER OUR MISSION BERMAN FORSMAN OF HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL LOS. I BELIEVE THAT IF WE DO THOSE TWO THINGS AND COMMUNICATE TRANSPARENTLY WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD MORE TRUST IN DGSE. THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEMS RELATED TO TOXIC CHEMICALS IS MAURY. THAN WIDELY RECOGNIZED YET CALIFORNIANS EXPECT. US TO SOLVE THEM. I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE A ARE TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP TO TACKLE THOSE PROBLEMS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MONNING LET'S START WITH YOU THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- THANK YOU. DIRECTOR CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT THANK YOU FOR. INTRODUCING YOUR FAMILY TO LISTEN I'M ADMIRING THAT WALL HANGING BEHIND YOU AS WELL. WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION THE OTHER DAY- I THINK JUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE PUBLIC IF YOU COULD JUST UPDATE ON THE WORK ON THE PHOTOVOLTAIC HAZARDOUS WASTE RECYCLING. UNITED HAD A CHANCE TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS AND I'VE APPRECIATED YOUR LEADERSHIP AND TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE IMPLEMENTATION. AS MANY OF THE SOLAR PANELS THAT WERE INSTALLED TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO ARE NOW AT END OF LIFE AND LOOKING FOR A FINAL. RESTING PLACE OF HE WILL IN IN THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATION OF COURSE WAS TO. TRY TO PROVIDE RECYCLING OF MATERIALS THAT ARE RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL OF WASTE PRODUCTS IN THIS. MANNER IS HAZARDOUS WASTE BUT I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN SOME STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH AND COULD YOU JUST PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE MAY BE WITH AN UPDATE AND HAS THAT STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH BEEN. IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING AND THANKS FOR YOUR TIME I WILL SAY THAT MY SPOKE VERY TALENTED SISTER MADE THE CALL BEHIND ME. I IN TERMS OF THE FOLDABLE TECH REGULATIONS I- OUR DEPARTMENT IS IN THE HOME STRETCH OF ADOPTING THOSE REGULATIONS WHAT THOSE RESIDENT REGULATIONS WILL DO IS ENABLE FOLKS TO TREAT. PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULES ONCE THEY'RE AT THE END OF LIFE AS UNIVERSAL RICK WASTE RATHER THAN HAZARDOUS WASTE AND RIGHT NOW THOSE MINERALS ARE CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS WASTE AND SO. OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S EASIER TO DISPOSE OF THEM PROPERLY YET SAFELY- IN TERMS OF A DELAY FROM CODED OF THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW THAT LAW WAS QUITE BACKED UP AND SO ALTHOUGH WE WENT AHEAD WITH THOSE REGULATIONS DAVE NEEDED A LITTLE EXTRA TIME TO. DO THEIR FINAL REVIEW WE EXPECT THAT REVIEW TO BE COMPLETE BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER FIRST WHICH MEANS THE UNIVERSAL WASTE DESIGNATION WILL BE IN EFFECT STARTING IN THE NEW YEAR. IT DOES. COME UP ADOPTED BY AWAY- WILL BEGIN OUR OUTREACH PROCESS WE WILL EDUCATE THE LOCALS. HAZARDOUS HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE AND HAZARDOUS WASTE HANDLERS AS TO WHAT THE REGULATIONS MEAN AND HOW TO- MANAGE THE PHOTOVOLTAIC MATERIALS WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE ALL OF THE REGULATIONS AND THEN WE'LL YOU KNOW WE'LL TRAIN. KIND OF WORK FROM A STATE OR CIRCLE OUT WE'LL GET OUR INTERNAL FOLKS AND THOSE WHO ARE MOST INTIMATELY A SOCIAL- RESPONSIBLE FOR HANDLING THE MATERIALS WELL TRAINED AND THEN WE'LL MOVE OUT- TO BROADER AND BROADER CIRCLES AND TO HOPEFULLY GET TO CONSUMERS WORKING PARTNERSHIP PERHAPS WITH OTHER AGENCIES WHO HAVE A BETTER CAN- CONSUMER INTERFACE. TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE AWARE OF WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AT THE END OF LIFE OF THEIR PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOU'VE BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO MY OFFICE IN MOVING THIS FORWARD. WE DID COME A NUMBER OTHER SUBS BUT- MADAM CHAIR I'M GOOD FOR NOW AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE. PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT- QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS AT. HOW ARE YOU WORKING TO IMPROVE THE DEPARTMENTS TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNICATION- WITH STAKEHOLDERS AGRICULTURE AND BEEN THERE THAT LONG BUT WANTED TO CUT IT CONSEQUENCES AND I'VE HEARD INSIDE STAKEHOLDERS GET TO THE TABLE NOT AS SOON AS THEY WOULD LIKE SO JUST CURIOUS ON YOUR PROGRESS ON THAT. WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT ISSUE ON A NUMBER OF FRIENDS SO I WOULD SAY. AS THE IMAGE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AS A WHOLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IS PUT FORTH A PROPOSAL. THAT'S UNDER CONSIDERATION NOW TO PUT A BOARDING PLACE TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT VENUE FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO COME BEFORE A BOARD RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEPARTMENTS AND- GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE DECISIONS WERE MAKING AND SO. THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL AND STAKEHOLDERS FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND THEN THEY'D MINISTRATIONS STANDS BY THAT PROPOSAL. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN CONTROL WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE A NEW STRATEGIC PLAN THAT STRATEGIC PLAN WAS BUILT AROUND THESE LONG STANDING CONCERNS FOR THE DEPARTMENT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND OF COURSE FISCAL STABILITY GIVEN OUR BECAUSE OUR- MONETARY FISCAL CHALLENGES. SO WE DO NOT PLAN WE'VE DONE THINGS LIKE- COMMITTED TO HAVING MEASURABLE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THAT WE CAN AND MAKE PUBLIC. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE COMMITTING TO DO AND ON OURWEBSITE WE WILL BE LAUNCHING DASHBOARDS THE CHORE PROGRESS AGAINST THOSE COMMITMENTS AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME TO US AND HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE AND SAY.

LET ME ASK DOCTOR WILLIAMS IF TO START YOU AYE IF THERE WERE QUITE A FEW COMMENTS THERE FROM. FOLKS AND- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF YOU WOULD LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON ANY OF THOSE. QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. FROM YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY. I WOULD SAY THESE ARE THE PRECISELY IN THE CHALLENGE THAT IS THAT I ALLUDED TO IN MY OPENING COMMENTS. I AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT WE. NEED TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OUR ENGAGE. A WE TO TAKE AGGRESSIVE STANCE. WHEN IT COMES TO ENFORCEMENT IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE EARING THESE BURDENS- UNFORTUNATELY THE WHEELS OF GOVERNMENT SOMETIMES MOVES SLOWLY WE ARE MOVING OUT FOR INSTANCE- WITH REGARD TO THE KERN COUNTY. KERN COUNTY CIVIL RIGHTS CONCERN THAT'S A CONCERN THAT WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION WE HAVE ENGAGED WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE ENGAGED WITH THE COUNTY WE ARE COMMITTED TO CIVIL RIGHTS AND LANGUAGE ACCESS IN FACT. BERMAN HAS ADOPTED A VERY FORWARD LEANING LANGUAGE ACCESS POLICY AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO NOT ONLY TO- IMPLEMENTING THAT POLICY OURSELVES BUT USING THAT POLICY TO GUIDE ACTIONS THAT ARE TAKEN BY OTHER AGENCIES WITH. IN YOU KNOW WITH WHICH WE- INTERACT AND SO. I JUST REINFORCED MY COMMITMENT THE SECRETARIES CONFIRMED COMMITMENT- THE GOVERNOR IS ALL ABOUT CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AND WHEN. AND THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THAT IS EQUITY YOU KNOW HE CAME OUT WITH CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AND TALKED ABOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND TALKED ABOUT. PLACES LIKE IMPERIAL THAT IMPERIAL WE'RE GOOD AT THE BURDENS ARE TREMENDOUS AND WE HAVE TO. JUST CONTINUE TO PUT OUR SHOULDER AGAINST THE WHEEL AND KEEP MOVING THE BALL FORWARD AND THAT'S MY COMPLAINT. THANK YOU DR WILLIAMS LET ME- BRING IT BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THEY HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OUR MOTION. THE SENATE ROTH I'M SORRY WELL LET ME FIRST MAKE THE MOTION TO CONFIRM THANK YOU. IT WILL JUST MAKE A COMMENT- YOU KNOW. IN GENERAL WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE COMMENTS THAT. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MAKE DURING THIS RULES COMMITTEE HEARING AND THE SUBMISSIONS THAT ARE PROVIDED TO US. AND WHEN WE RECEIVE THEM I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUES WE TAKE THOSE SUBMISSIONS SERIOUSLY AND WE LOOK INTO THEM. SO THAT WE TRY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND WE TRY VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. THE VARIOUS POSITIONS THAT ARE PRESENTED WITH RESPECT TO THE GOVERNOR'S. NOMINEES THIS IS NOT A SLAM DUNK WIN WIN NOMINEES ARE PRESENTED TO THE RULES COMMITTEE AND NO ONE SHOULD THINK IT IS BUT IN LOOKING AT THE STAFF REPORT THAT I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME IT SAYS OPPOSITION NONE REPORTED. AND IN FACT IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER I MADE MY COMMENTS DR ABOUT YOU BUT I RECEIVED A TEXT FROM MY STAFF MEMBER WHO INDICATED THAT A LETTER OF OPPOSITION AND COME IN. JUST AT THAT MOMENT I'M NOT SPEAKING TO YOUR DOCTOR I'M SPEAKING TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AND I THINK TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE STILL ON THE LINE. IF YOU HAVE ISSUES THAT ARE OF CONCERN TO YOU ON THIS APPOINTMENT OR ANY OTHERS THAT COME BEFORE THE RULES COMMITTEE. I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON YOU TO. PROVIDE YOUR COMMENTS IF YOU CAN IN ADVANCE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND WE CAN LOOK INTO THEM. AND WE CAN HAVE AN INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION WITH THE NOMINEES AT THE GOVERNOR PUTS FORWARD. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ANALYZE WHAT YOU SAY TO US IN PUBLIC COMMENT AND DEAL WITH THAT. IN THE TWO OR THREE MINUTES THAT YOU HAVE AND IN THE TIME THEN THAT WE HAVE. TO DEAL WITH THE NOMINATION SO MATTER PRO TEMAS TO MAKE THE MOTION TO CONFIRM AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT MY COMMENTS ARE ON THE RECORD SO THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LISTENING WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION. I UNDERSTAND THE POSITION THAT WE'RE IN. I WILL COMMIT TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE- ORGANIZATIONS THAT- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I WILL I WILL WILL WORK WITH THE DOCTOR. AND THE T. S. C. TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED. ISSUES OF STAKEHOLDER RESPONSIVENESS- ISSUES OF RESPONSIVENESS TO THE NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY SO WITH THAT METAL PROTEIN THANK YOU FOR GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- I'D LIKE TO JUST TO LINE MY COMMENTS WITH US OF SENATOR ROTH- I JUST LEARNED FROM MY STAFF- IS WELL ABOUT OPPOSITION AND- IT IS HELPFUL FOR US TO HAVE. CONCERNS VOICED. AT LEAST WITH ENOUGH TIME TO. LOOK INTO IT MAYBE FORMULATE OUR QUESTIONS FOR ANY CANDIDATE WHO COMES FORWARD. BUT BEING SENSITIVE TO THE CONCERNS RAISED THE COMMONALITY OF ALL THOSE WHO WEIGHED IN. WAS AN ISSUE OF. ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM OF TOXIC DUMPS AND AS WE KNOW THE HISTORY OF THIS STATE THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY AND A GLOBALLY TOXIC WASTE OR TOXIC PER. IS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT LOCATED NEAR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR I THINK SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS THAT ARE NOT THE FAULT OF TODAY'S CANDIDATE ALSO INCLUDE BUDGET PRIORITIES FOR STATE ACTION AND AS WELL AS HOLDING RESPONSIBLE INDUSTRIES ACCOUNTABLE- FOR REMEDIATION AND IDEALLY FOR PREVENTION IN THE FIRST PLACE- SO WHEN I HEAR FROM. THE DIRECTOR AND IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH HER SHE SHARES THOSE CONCERNS AND COMMITMENTS WE FACE A PARTICULARLY TOUGH TIME NOW WITH COVERT NINETEEN THE IMPACT ON THE STATE'S BUDGET. AND OUR ABSOLUTE DEPENDENCE. ON SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT HAS NOT BEEN FORTHCOMING DUE TO INACTION. IN CONGRESS IN FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. TO HELP SUPPORT STATES AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO FULFILL EXISTING OBLIGATIONS AND INDEED TO LOOK TO EXPANDING OUR CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO THE VERY CONCERNED SO WELL I THINK THOSE WHO WAIT IN. AND UNDERSTAND THE SINCERITY OF THEIR CONCERNS. I THINK THE PROBLEM CITED ACTUALLY GO BEYOND. ANY CULPABILITY OF THIS NOMINEE- OR PERHAPS OF THE DEPARTMENT AND REQUIRE STRUCTURAL REFORM AT THE STATE LEVEL IN TERMS OF THE PRIORITIZATION THAT IS THOUGHT AND I WOULD JUST CONCLUDE BY ENCOURAGING THE DIRECTOR WHO'S ON THE FRONT LINE OF THIS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE SECRETARY IN THE GOVERNOR ARE KEPT IN REGULAR- COMMUNICATION ON THE NEEDS OF VARIOUS COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE MAY BE BUDGET ACTION REQUIRED OR LEGISLATIVE ACTION REQUIRED. SO WITH THAT- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE CONFIRMATION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SENATOR MINING- LET ME CONCLUDE WITH THIS I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO SPOKE TODAY IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR PROCESS AND I WOULD SAY THAT. THE SENATE OUT MUCH TO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR ROTH AYE THIS IS NOT A RUBBER STAMP WE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST AND WHAT WE WILL DO- WORKING WITH THE DIRECTOR AND CERTAINLY THE SECRETARY. AS WE MOVE FORWARD- MY STAFF ARE. ON MANY OCCASIONS WHEN THERE IS OPPOSITION TAKE NOTES WE HAVE. THE MINUTES FROM OUR STENOGRAPHER. TO OUTLINE THE ISSUES OF CONCERN AND WE WILL COMMUNICATE WITH THE DIRECTOR AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT THAT IN WRITING AND TO FORWARD IT. AND IT ALSO TO TALK ABOUT THE ROLE THAT WE PLAY IN OVERSIGHT- IT N. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND WE HAVE DONE THAT WITH OTHER DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS. WE HAVE HELD MEETINGS- AFTER TO OUR TO GO OVER ISSUES OF CONCERN AND TO. MY COLLEAGUES SENATOR MINING'S POINT- SOME OF THESE DEFICIENCIES ARE. A SYSTEMATIC I THINK IN TERMS OF HISTORY- I THINK THAT IS WHY I THINK THE GOVERNOR I BELIEVE TRIES TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENTS WITH THAT IN MIND IN TERMS OF THE REPRESENTATION TO COVER ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IGNORED- I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CASE HERE BASED ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS I HEARD FROM SOME ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT. SO WE WILL COMMUNICATE WITH YOU FURTHER- DIRECTOR AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HAVING AN ONGOING. DIALOGUE AND THAT WE ACCEPT OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSIGHT MONITORING BUT ALSO AS IT COMES TO BUDGETARY ACTIONS- IN TERMS OF WHAT MIGHT BE NEEDED- AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT ISSUES WHICH WAS OUTLINED IN AND IN OUR- STAFF FOR A REPORT AND NOTES RELATED TO SOME OF THE ISSUES. THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS HISTORICALLY HAD AND WE HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY THERE SO. HAVING SAID THAT I. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE MOTION. AND MADAM SECRETARY WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BATES WILL BE JOINING US SHORTLY AND I WAS NOT UNDER THAT IMPRESSION BEFORE SO. WEWILL LEAVE THE WORLD BUT FOR NOW WE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THANK YOU GO AHEAD. OKAY WHAT A FORMER DIRECTOR PAM ALLEN. WHEN SHE SAID WHO WILL WIN MISS CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT SHE HAD ASSURED THE SAME THAT THE PATIENTS HAVE AN OUTLET FOR THEIR GRIEVANCES TO BE FULLY VETTED AND WE POPPED. NOW THIS IS PROOF OF THIS WAS SENT. TO THE APPOINTMENT OFFICE INTO THE STAFFERS ON THE COMMITTEE UNFORTUNATELY THAT PATIENT RIGHT THAT SHE WAS REFERRING TO HAS BECOME A FAILURE. ONE OF THE THINGS. IN REGARDS TO THAT IS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN JANUARY THERE WAS AT DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS COALINGA THERE IS A FULL AND THEY WERE VIOLATION THAT DEALT WITH LIKE COMMUNICATIONS TWO ATTORNEYS COMMUNICATIONS TWO OTHER PEOPLE THROUGH THE PHONE AND ALL. AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S RECORDED- AT THAT TIME AND NOW THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BRANDON PRICE HE HAD SHARED THAT AND THE QUOTE IS HE SAID THAT WHEN HE GETS A RESPONSE REGARDING TOMORROW OF PATIENTS RIGHT. IT WILL BE POSTED. UP UNTIL TODAY THIS THERE WAS NOTHING POSTED THERE WAS NOTHING PUT IN THE PATIENT CHARGE THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTATION THAT THAT DENIAL OF RIGHTS EVER HAPPENED I FIND IT VERY DISCONCERTING. THAT MISS MISS CLINTON DIDN'T WOULD LET IT GO ALL THIS TIME. AND IGNORE THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO DOCUMENTATION THAT'S MOVING FORWARD WHEN PATIENTS RIGHT WHEN THE PATIENTS THEIR RIGHTS ARE BEING DENIED. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE TALKED QUITE A BIT ABOUT DEALING WITH THE COLD AT NINETEEN. AND DISCONCERTING THING IS PATIENCE AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. HAVE SPOKEN QUITE A BIT TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS COALINGA AND UP DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS THEY STILL HAVE NOT SET UP A HOTLINE WHERE PATIENTS OR- BOARD MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. CAN REPORT VIOLATIONS THAT DEAL WITH THE STAFF WE CONTINUE ADDS CO IT DEPARTMENTS THAT ARSENAL'S CALLING IT TO HAVE STAFF MEMBERS GOING FROM QUARANTINE UNITS. THAT EVEN HAVE THE COLD IN NINETEEN AND WORKING ON OTHER UNITS WHICH CONTINUES TODAY. WITHIN THE LAST THREE DAYS THERE WAS A NEW UNIT THAT JUST HAD TEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE IN THE LAST THREE DAYS. THAT BECOMES A VERY ALARMING ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S WE WAS REPORTED EARLIER BUT SEPTEMBER FROM A QUARANTINE UNIT WAS VISITING THAT. I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT. THE STAFF IN THE CLINTON OR STERLING PRICE WOULD BE A BAD EXAMPLE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND INVESTIGATED BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD. BECAUSE I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE SHOWN ENOUGH THAT THEY WANT TO CORRECT THESE PROBLEMS THANK YOU THANK YOU MR OAKES. OF MATAMATA RAIDER NEXT WITNESS.
