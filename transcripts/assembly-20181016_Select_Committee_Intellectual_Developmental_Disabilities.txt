Thank you for being part of the first regional. Session of the select committee of intellectual developmental disabilities. Thank you Fresno for hosting us. Who were anxiously awaiting his arrival he? Assemblymember thirty first district for joining us this evening. I'll be brief. Remarks. Listen to you. Not me. Assemblymember Jim Frazier. Aye represents the eleventh assembly district the delta region. But I'm here today because I chair of this committee. Discuss. It with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Thanks us all regardless of our background [inaudible] Is. This a select committee on the ID de movie is listening and listening intently. Doesn't concerns and suggestions. On how we can improve. Servicing the people we care. For select. Different from standing register committees. Some pending legislation but legislation can happen. With all of your input. And that. I really hope that you can give us your input. Help move the needle forward. And I move forward. I'm sorry. The system did and how we can improve moving forward. Hey we have expressed our respective fields testifying to the rentals. Program services and challenges. But as we can test we will Rev up for the next legislative cycle as we wrap this one up. Number eighty population continues to grow and we need to be able to provide support and services that are essential to this population. So. Without further ado. I would to say that we should get started on this. Great. Opportunity to meet each and everyone of you. Elvis taken around afterwards if you have anything that you'd like to add. On the maybe you're just a little bit bashful public or just want to be in private I'm more than happy to have a discussion with. Each any one of you until. Thank you similar member Frazier we're glad to have you and your team here and are very positive -- For amber you're coordinating efforts and bringing us all together here and I understand you're from Clovis highs so you of the Central Valley connection we appreciate that. So -- I want to say. I'm gonna disclose some billing stuff last year and commuters Lecter their lives simply also purpose capacidad often a lot intellect Wallasey love. Del Desiderio yes a person on but I could not in store pertaining died there scratch about in bias and from. An internal caps on us in the LA Argentina can seven Espanol là sympathetic and now I am in the coming safe Rachel translator. That appeals okay I on about some of the Ana until becoming a thing going. On but I can see use that assesses changing times -- We serve in the Central Valley over nineteen thousand four hundred individuals representing six counties I do have a power point [inaudible] In. The city California's you know has made a commitment under the Lanham act to serve people throughout the state California Rick. Com um and so what will into meant for individuals with developmental the bill. And their families I'm in other states on their thing là this other states if you don't qualify for Medicaid you don't answer. Is. On your own for families that can be very challenging any numbers such actions or they can. One third of many things that the rest of us take. For the mobile. Seven for members developmental disabilities. Until they got Irwin. In and the that's the earn so it's crucial. Birth out our work that we do that. Members come from. Some members come personal voice found that we must attend. To the service must either it's I'm step. Those are at stake graphic in our area we have steps but not often entity. Talked with the state not aid in teas and the reason for this was that we are supposed to be nimble and flexible to the needs of our community. And sometimes people get a little frustrated because you go between regional centers and things might seem a little different now services once you receive them once you're found eligible under the Lanham acts so age three and up -- You should be eligible throughout the state your services should transfer between regional centers. In the not so distant past regional centers what kind of coral or bicker over the money following the person and when did that money got transferred in the state. Several years back made a change where the regional centers are true. To at the end of the year so they should be no more issues around case transfers but I hear that there are still some challenges along those lines. Our philosophy at CRC to the greatest extent possible is just take the case we need to get families part of the services as quickly as possible [inaudible] I'm. In the Central Valley we have issues around transportation -- Lack of social opportunities insufficient medical care providers are airy our our needs can be very different from the needs of the rest of the state -- Because we don't have all these connective tissue with bus lines and and high speed rail yet you know these things are coming and I know that you're on the transportation sub sub committee and more to come transportation is a huge issue in our area. People -- Assume that we don't have housing issues here in the valley because we have lots of land and because we're a low income area but we have very similar issues to other parts of the state's. We have a low capacity for housing -- There is housing that is being built for instance in Clovis but Fresno had made some changes in their housing and redevelopment and zoning -- Look -- More to come on that and I know that that's not special instead is is all [inaudible] In. Bedroom apartment what washer and dryer the going rate the theft and Dahle. Which is a real I would consider once in could be hundreds or some. Maybe nine hundred a month they count of for other things if trying to buy into a nice neighborhood. So they often in the neighborhoods that are more dangerous than they should be. If can get in at all because we in the back to get your about ours than Marler. What's in it is -- So you can see that will talk about area Los Angeles there are very different than ours if we were to look assist as a whole. We may miss some of needs Central Valley of weren't promote independence employability care and support -- We also have to access generic services this was an original intent of the letterman act that service coordination. The doctor immune [inaudible] Welcome. Please proceed thank you. I'm generic or services are requirement of the regional centers to access. So first five insurance medi cal funded services and school districts are things we must attend to before we can purchase of service -- And with generic services sometimes people get confused about those -- But it will as I said it was an original intent of Lanham act that the regional centers are service coordination entities. And that was our first and foremost I'm a borrowed from Star Trek our prime directive -- Is service coordination so I have a slight later that shows you -- From the complex systems that families have to navigate and our job is to try to help them navigate complex systems. I wanted to bring your attention to community access services that senior CS engaged in at this time. We have a promo toward community navigator program which is working with our Spanish speaking among speaking communities this is headed up by my chief counselor ritual Hagens who's in the back -- And these folks go into the homes they talk with the families about why they're not accessing services and what those. Challenges are and we're learning in some cultures -- Feel somewhat ashamed perhaps in their community to have a family member board of the developmental disability. But we didn't understand then the deeper dive was even showing up to their house called attention to this and if you're talking about a clown system for instance this could change your standing in the clown. So it's very complex it's very important we have those community navigators helping us on this is the program for center of new Americans that we've -- Contracted with. I'm wearing gauging in person center practices training for all staff for our service providers families and individuals through Michael small. And I put a under liner rips and a river Berman in the back also helps us with the project. In control compensate for all staff at the for service for your through doctor Valerie about the vision ink we also don't ting called. Us and try to reach out to understand that neighborhoods so that we can have direct access individuals and families research here from their voice directly. These are just some examples of how we're trying dressed in meridian arc de. These are examples of services region centers provide spit care in op is Dave programs. Of schemes don't center one of the things we take pride in an at a rain my the mission back there. Started this night guys so you won T.. Be helpful. Answer phones twenty four seven so we do not some people to voice mail. And one of the ages certainly made. A few to the desk you will be routed to a real person for intake and assessment this is a well known and in some vantage of the last. Of the in it's a very important. And a vote. 7% of the Chau pain need services beyond early start early intervention which is really exciting number that I just heard from one of our city kids Clovis unified partners -- So I can go into detail with us if you would like these are the criteria we also have a handout that was at the front table for what the criteria are. Now. If you weren't confused before for early start here are the rules for age three through adulthood. So once a child begins to turn three so you're not quite there yet -- We start assessing for went but what we fondly call Lanham eligibility. And that's what you're mostly clear with up to three calls to lex just the in app lapsed and then. The fifth. So there services. Persons planes so similar to support an election disability. Or some some with. With [inaudible] Ability. Do you have to have three out of seven what they call stone the regulations I hate using this term but that's and regulations substantially handicapping. Conditions which must be met. And thirty two thousand three legislation you used to be able to qualify with to out of seven but it was a cost savings measure by the state at that time to increase the number of substantial handicaps you must have to get into the system. Prior to that in two thousand two there was a legislative change. Where the assessment period moved from sixty days which was the norm for linemen eligibility to a hundred and twenty days -- So these are both cost savings motor so sometimes we hear from the community the frustration around eligibility -- And we do have a team here -- Tammy Maranda his here to she's our clinical Sir I'm about how do you get into the system how do you. You know how do you how do you get found eligible it all starts with referral process -- Robust review of records as many records as we can get from school systems these sorts of things. And then -- If we need to will do our own assessment using a psychologist and then an interdisciplinary team made up of a physician psychologist the service coordinator at Sutter will make on decisions around eligibility based on all the afraid of available data and information. One thing you're probably aware of is starting an intake and assessment all the way through our service provision there's always room for AA exceptions and be. Appeals. And we are not opposed to appeals in fact sometimes we will encourage families to do appeals because that will allow a judge to make a decision in a different direction. Than maybe we feel we're allowed to do by what's in regulation are law. But for families that can be a burden that's just one more thing for them to go through -- When you know when they're when they're trying to get their needs met and? On for the way the laws are written you know but I have someone come in with schizophrenia and that alone I'm not going to be able to serve them and that's really hard on the family. They come in and crisis and they want us to serve them. And we have to tell them now so our job is a community is a collaborative community in partnership with exceptional fair parents unlimited. And our other community partners six EP you exceptional parents unlimited as our family resource center -- Hand offs together and make sure that people get plugged into the services they need so they're not just told you're not eligible and move on with your life. And we really try to help families are in crisis even if we're not that person for on I'm these are examples of services we provide birth to three I just want to draw to your attention in. Two thousand nine there was legislation passed that no longer allow us to provide space for in some top players. Is a full the feet third. Member. Of baby. A ticket their baby in a person time I'm not fine out have you ever. Care take first. Family member who maybe wasn't hot. Or in on this. One when you're. In first when you're on the phone or seven or take burn out they've [inaudible] My gosh -- Formally included in -- School age -- Was also -- Suspended services such as social recreation in camp -- In age twenty three and up we work on employability housing medical support and quirk. That map of telling you about earlier to get permission. For post this. Man this is around. She's served area but I'm assuming full of comp since the fan is half now but it. Room regional planner is opposed to be to help family now very complex systems -- And you can see when you look at the health care systems education systems all these sorts of things that families must get engaged with that this can be very complex and challenging for them and whatever we can do to simplify their lives it's really imperative -- So systems challenges in our service leader. The river centers tomorrow we was up for one and all center for every million residents so we have four regional center state and by the math the relaxation stopped at twenty one each. Other's so about services service coordination and the ability to meet family's needs and have time for them you know these are some areas that you might want to look up. Systems challenge an adequately funded provider rates the provider rate study that's upcoming is a great opportunity. To look at these sorts of things but we've also had rate freezes legislative mandates for uniform holiday schedules finally called forced closure days. And half day billing -- Which has severely impacted our providers their ability to hire keep and retain staff and provide quality services. Providers and I also including providers to see you know the concept of para professionals parents are professionals in the care of their own children. And many of them are highly specialized especially in the medical and behavioral care of their children. So there are services that we funded that support the family reckless and serve as context and there's an optional. I'm not on the on the phone staff in that inch X. retain town. And for example since and loss of the local ability. To provide start up monies for creative services or just rate for next level service. Local area challenges here in the valley transportation accessing costs rural areas have limited resources. As I said earlier acting training [inaudible] Personnel also. Well in 30% speed occupational therapy physical therapy. Hi but pretty and in security valley. And safe and adequate housing I addressed a little bit earlier. I got a couple more minutes. I'm almost done -- And also the bridge funding that was recently up local -- Providers in this area were preemptively excluded -- I know the decision hasn't been fully made yet but at the hearing we were told that we were being excluded because were considered a low cost area. But if you look at the challenges we face in the valley and you accommodate for those factors were probably just as high cost is up other areas -- ABA services transition to insurance has been a challenge -- Families are very confused around enrollment with insurance which providers are in network. And the things that we use to rape working with our providers within the regional centers pay their bills on time a lot of our providers have billing department now. And don't get their paid on time for the insurance companies staffing crisis I've touched on a little bit earlier -- Touch trusted staffer leaving rage compression -- And providers not of the pay directs this professionals more than minimum wage so they're leaving for and number and stuff ox care take is used. As a trusted spit opportunities and not all families could depress but on a monthly basis but that one time -- For two weeks was very helpful for families -- And also reduce unnecessary administrative burdens I've read through the latest a hundred and fifty trailer bill since two thousand eight line by line and there's a lot of room I think they're for change -- Keep DC closure money in the community based system I know this is been a hot topic over the last while we have portable mental center own backyard. In her -- All done with our Xin the Jack treatment closure. On but many follow a certain person follow vigils challenging needs but it would be nice for to come to this around in the job find. Stop at some of these -- Cost thing that. That would address some of these issues I brought up earlier. System solutions fully fine staffing and other crucial rates the rate study is an opportunity -- Allow regional is once again to address crucial rates it tears up local. Full funds. Refresh [inaudible] And finally. Collaboration is crucial it's really imperative to do is you're doing today listen to families vigil service covers provide there's the biggest champions with someone chair. Of for the population in the capital also so [inaudible] Assemblymember. I want to start if I can by apologizing for being late I have a responsibility as a parent professional myself and on days that I'm home I pick up my three daughters -- And are three five and seven year old sometimes preoccupied me at home. I wanted to be able to come here and I'm quite pleased that assemblymember Frazier. Decided to hold this select committee hearing here today. In Fresno. Because oftentimes our voices in the Central Valley are not heard in our state capitol. Easy where they the Los faces on the loss of Shauna skin number the outlined and copy thousand this stuff. So on board okay tangle meal. E. aqui en and bias and problems the son Joaquin I parts only the odds but I realize you sub doubles. The grass yes but a lot but to me the I. but it's the idea. I wanna thank you for the opportunity to be here. And I will stop just to allow. More time for the can this. We don't hear from our community and I really look forward to this opportunity today so thank you for having this year. Thank you doctor and I just want to acknowledge a couple members of staff have. Joined us this evening also -- We have in. Compare with us some member Patterson's office. And we have -- Denise of runs. From assemblymember Rubio's offices record okay good good to see you guys and thank you. And please share with your members we appreciate. Your participation in in the hearing today -- We're gonna move on to our next panelist Alaska -- Rear mirrors. To come on up to the to the podium please. Greetings. Good evening thank you so much assemblymember Frazier for chairing the select committee first and foremost and also for having these listening sessions these hearings. And thank you so a member of Arambula for being here tonight to support us. I'm it's again like heather said it's just great to have you here in Fresno and thank you amber was in joint meeting with you and talking -- I think I'll take less time so we can get caught up quick -- Saw many hit my timer -- So first of all and executive director twenty eight years I've been executive director for twenty of those years and I know that the lord above has blessed me with this job and I feel so. Privileged to work for people with developmental disabilities first and foremost. I'm and I'm here tonight strictly for them -- To share with you -- Wonderful things that we're doing in the community as service providers but many of the struggles that were having and so the very first thing that I I could just say in publicidad on would be insufficient funding. If we just stop there and more money came our way would be very helpful to address many of our issues and concerns. The main thing -- I've been around long enough to know that the rates been frozen twenty plus years and is some of my peers will remember there were cost statements at the time the DDS would require from us. And you centers in every two years and they were actual dollars that you spent and then you've got a rate to meet your needs to keep doing this service will that was frozen in nineteen ninety eight we have had to increases that were -- Primarily for wage pass through which is desperately needed to paid staff her doing this work hands on so we did have money I'm about to year goes with the AB two X. -- One dollars there were one time in -- Two thousand four one of the things that -- Heather brought up is about and we're thankful there three left and we agreed that the hundred plus million dollars that we believe the state would save -- Every year after the closure will lead to should go back into the system that serves the people that were serving three earned thirty thousand plus people in California -- So one of the biggest things with staffing -- With -- Funding being so tough is that we are having a much harder time now attracting qualified staff. And right now -- On any given day you at our agency we serve a six hundred and thirty five adults -- And we do it with two hundred staff and we usually have between seven and ten positions open at any given time. And to so that causes a real problem with ratios you're supposed to required to have so many staff for pretty clients you're serving. And that makes very hard so and now we're learning because minimum wage we all agree people deserve to make more money -- To living out there is getting tough -- But the people are now leaving for jobs that are they concert to be a much less stressful job I was at a restaurant recently and I had the gumption to actually asked the waitress because she seems so. Knowledgeable about her job and very good which is about me disabled adults and really since it's a lot less stress. Is like wow you know I couldn't even convince somebody in a restaurant to maybe consider to help a human being and services and so that's a sign of our times -- So that's what's probably the biggest -- Hurdle for many of our providers I'm only speaking for they are tonight but for most of the providers are here -- They experience the same thing minimum wage going up in 202075% of our staff will be a minimum wage and all other wages will have collapsed we will be almost on the same all of our fifteen sixteen your employees or more will be. At the same level and so that's gonna be a huge -- Concern for us -- Because we're gonna lose a lot of staff they're going to move on to other jobs -- Were concerned a better quality of services can be very challenging we expect outcomes for individuals there's goals and objectives that need to be tracked. And we're going to be concerned about the revolving door staff there's no continuity then in the service when you deal with people with disabilities. And so with constant changing of staff gives no consistency or care of support of the people we serve and that's public the most concerning to me -- We are always juggling every single day to you -- Plug the holes in the boat that feels like the waters just pouring out everywhere -- It's just gonna get worse the next couple years it seems kind of I'm kind of on you know twenty years I'm kind on the downhill slide of my career here and it's just really I'm. Disheartening to see what's happening to the system so -- So then on top of this of the funding -- I want to stick with that because and you know unfortunately DDS we did have I know recession cuts that we needed to take in two thousand eight nine and ten I believe it was. And but the state has totally turned around we understand governor brown has done some great job and putting like nine billion dollars in rainy day funds which is great. But when in our system when we're now hit with half day billing and with more for more closure days -- That's a hundred sixty thousand dollars or agency that's not a little small amount of money to us -- And so that's really -- A little overwhelming when you know the state does have nine billion dollars and rainy day funds -- I and I think people with development disabilities are very deserving of every opportunity life that you and I are in so. That we have to go through these -- May through is very I'm upsetting -- One of the other things to is when we run these agencies we are a nonprofit we've been on a five oh one see -- Three but we were very lean administration group so it because it takes people to manage the people that manage the direct care staff. I'm we have the same needs of corporate -- Businesses and technically I could use at least four or five more on lead manager and director positions to help us keep doing what we're doing to keep the doors open to help. The direct care staff -- But I just recently have two openings for manager jobs and three people that applied for the jobs when we told with the salary was declined immediately -- And so we don't have a long line at the door to come in and and do the jobs in the services that we want to offer. And so -- It just seems like every day there's just another obstacle another roadblock to giving good quality services to people with disabilities -- Another thing that is happening is transportation is -- An issue the federal government expects -- More community Gration with two thousand twenty two I'm from the five of our five in the community we do integrate -- But for us to get more based on with them CMS rules looking for we need bunch on many more staff and vehicles -- And so one of the things that I want to share with you was that -- I did a quick analysis of those four five positions and if I put how many vehicles I need to get out and I need staff. And if we were to pay them the right salaries to do the jobs it would require 2225% increase and then of course the bumps up the different levels as we go up. My agency alone almost needs to million dollars more a year to do everything sufficiently and meet all those needs. And so on were just -- Not sure winner if that money will be coming so I'm the other thing is that -- The we offer work activity programs and there's been a lot of concern about -- How valid those are and if we should be looking at closing those and we believe that every individual deserves an operate shoot for employment wherever they see fit that's their choice? And we want to make sure that the state does not consider closing any kind of options that are out there in that are available. And so we want to really encourage you to talk to others about employment opportunities for our clients and making sure that all options are out there for them that we don't close anything. I'm. I think the last thing that I want to say is that -- So we work really hard to meet the needs of the families in the individuals we serve and we take this job so seriously. And that we want to do more and better for them -- But right now we are being stranglehold but also by a lot of regulatory constraints also problematic for us it's amazing the amount of documentation and audits and reviews and everything that we go through on top of it feels like some days we don't even get to talk. Or touch the individual we're so busy meeting regulatory things and so -- We can use some real relief and that -- And so. I have many new ideas and things that we could -- Suggests that could be looked at and would like to submit that to both later at another time but in closing I just would really implore you. To think about the funding first and foremost and go from there but thank you so much for tonight and for this opportunity. So I will tell you that -- Through my office we do hire the arc in Contra Costa county to do -- I gives certificates of recognition to every high school graduate in my districts was about eighty thousand a year. And we hire the are to do the certificates right. Alphabetized all Ole the quality is unsurpassed yeah and so you know I highly recommend anybody has an opportunity. To utilize this work forces as and some amazing opportunity and and but yeah it kinda you got is you have to settle up. All right so. Thank you for the plug I don't have to say any of it is good to hear using -- But yeah that's how we feel there such as they are hard workers they're dedicated they show up there their amazing individuals and so we want to give them every chance to work just like you and I thank you again. Work in progress thank you. So move on to a Teman water board certified behavioral. Analyst pleased at the podium please [inaudible] See [inaudible] Thank you. My name is Tamera one and I am a Central Valley native. Go eagles Clovis west graduate -- I began my career is behavior analysts at hold them back behavioral health in nineteen ninety four so I've been there for some time. And that has allowed me to see lots of different trends here in the valley -- Hold a master's degree in psychology and a board certification from the a and B. A. C. B.. I am. And the clinical director -- For the early intervention program for children with autism. And I also oversee engine services for individuals with developmental disabilities other than autism of all ages -- I also my parent professional have twelve children. And and seven of them have physical disabilities and one is an adult with intellectual disabilities so I do understand that and appreciate the unique challenge of obtaining. Services for individuals especially adults with developmental disabilities. An first I just wanted to talk a little bit about what ABA is ABA that acronym applied behavior analysis. Be here now is this is the science of behavior which is a history. Has a history extending back to the early twentieth century. Its underlying philosophy is behaviorism which is based on the premise that attempting to improve the human condition be he is three behavior change. I'm basic behavior analytics scientists have conducted thousands of studies to identify the laws of behavior and the predictable ways in which behaviors learned and how to change it over time. The underlying theme of much work has been that behavior is a product of its circumstances particularly the events that immediately follow the behavior. Supplied behavior analysis analysts have been using the information to develop numerous techniques and treatment approaches for analyzing and changing behavior and ultimately to improve lives. Because this approach is largely based on behavior and its consequences the techniques generally involve teaching individuals more effective ways of behaving in making changes to social consequences of existing behavior. AB Aizen Pericles shown to be effective in a wide variety of areas including parent training. Substance abuse treatment dementia management brain injury rehabilitation occupational safety intervention and among others however because ABA was first applied to the treatment of individuals with intellectual disabilities and autism. This is the practice that is most largely evidence based and has received the most recognition. Am I work for holding back behavioral health we've been a provider here in the Central Valley for over thirty years -- We provide individual assessments and we decide design individual intervention to address the specific needs of families in our community we help increase behaviors such as language acquisition cooperation. Pre academic readiness toilet training self management other socially valued behaviors we also said assist with the reduction of behavior such as aggression or self injurious behavior. We help people throughout their lives is needed addressing the unique challenges faced by individuals. Like children teens and adults. Our early intervention services for young children with autism. And when I first started in the field this is not a service that was covered. By the regional centers by insurance it wasn't recognized as something that was vital -- And since it is now and funded through the Central Valley regional center and now I've seen that transition to an health insurance companies and now medi cal. Sting quite a ride. And it since it's services for children with a diagnosis of autism focus on core behavior deficits in accesses parents participate in one to one intensive services between an analyst in a child. The assessment and intervention plan are proposed to specifically address that individual child's and deficits in accesses. It's a huge commitment by families we're looking at ten to forty hours a week of service for a child that might be two years to four years of age. And however -- As a conservative taxpayer myself and a scientist I've always interest in the data -- So. Because of the accountability of that we were curious as the company to see the fiscal impact which I think is important to all y'all. All y'all's what we say here in Central Valley. Home we're very curious about the fiscal impact and so we did some in house research looking at children with the diagnosis of autism he received early intervention services. Defined as twenty hours or greater beginning before the age of 485290% of those children landed in general education public school. With no support. You could not identify them from other children in a class. And now I'd like to say that is because we're create company. Well it's actually because of great team thing to do with just as it -- It's not an accident though it's result of good AB services with calf careful treatment planning. Parents to commit to consistent services and sacrifice countless hours for children's progress. It's result of staff who diligently followed through with program curriculum teachers who collaborated with us it was result of whites funding from a regional center careful steps to achieving accountability for the provider and the parent and straight up hard work. Is result of team work. And we to as a company experience a lot of the challenges that and that the ark experience it's very difficult for us. To an attract and retain individuals who are. Trained in in behavior analysis who might speak Spanish you might speak mom who are eager to help in a very stressful job. We've had rate freezes for very long time -- But I'm hooked so I'm not going anywhere because once you seen a child and progress and you see a family and turn around to be able to have dinner together is here child say their first words. You get hooked so. An a couple of then we also work with. I do want to leave out that we also work with teens and adults. And as it provider I've seen not population of individuals who missed out on that early intervention. Applied behavior analysis still works for them it's a different set of unique challenges -- And so we do provide services to teens and adults. And we help increase behavior such as effective communication safety awareness self management and other socially valued behaviors increase independence and autonomy. Also system reduction with behaviors that create barriers for them such as aggression or self injurious behavior An here in the valley. We do have some unique challenges that I see. As a provider and families. We're in fast geographic areas you'll now. And since we provide services in the homes that means we're having staff drive. Needs vast geographic areas -- And since autism and other disabilities they're not discriminative the impact the entire community reaching from every socioeconomic class every gender every race and ethnicity and every corner of our community. Several unique challenges -- That come to mind as heather mentioned is reaching the many variety of cultures and and families where. Stereotypically Sam are skeptical of outsiders coming and so providing centers or other -- Means of attaining applied behavior analysis would be great. But again it takes spending. Am keep keeping in retaining and monolingual Spanish speaking. Employees has been so difficult. True story I played a plate I played to hold them back behavior health when they were hiring for a modeling tools are bilingual Spanish speaking individual I speak no Spanish what I thought I could find people that speaks. You can find people that speak other languages but it is a unique challenge keeping them retaining them. On in the in the work force reap freezes and difficulties with that [inaudible] I am. Another trend that I've seen. As the health insurance and Medicare transitioning. We are so blessed that front Central Valley regional center has been incredible with helping through those transitions I feel like it's a team teamwork thing. Every day I work with three different regional centers and this is a star regional center Central Valley regional center talk about team work and transitioning. South are not afraid to hold providers accountable. In as a provider I'm thankful for that because I've seen many providers. Senate shop here in the valley there here today gone tomorrow in so I think that accountability continued and is very important. For our consumers. And I heard a time I think I'm done [inaudible] Now. I think I'm done. Thank you so much. Thank you. We're gonna move on to Mister chairman have just absolutely Christmas -- There's a reoccurring theme and I wanted to highlighted because it's nice when we hear it to make sure that we capture it and that was transportation -- I was recently at monta Vista it's a in read Lee and they have moderate to severe developmental. Disabilities and they were discussing similar concerns about transportation. And so I just wanted to take a moment and highlight that if I could. And also to say the importance of early intervention -- Tomorrow I'm going to a conference in. Adverse childhood experiences which for those of you that have not heard me before it's what I believe is the single largest public health discrepancy that we're not talking about enough. And so I hope that those of you in the room will take this opportunity to do some research on it. There's a wonderful book called the deepest well if you have not read it it's one of the best books I've read in a decade. Based off what you are saying I think you also see the importance of that early intervention and that it is wise for us to make sure we are. Funding it appropriately. Our fellow thank you a doctor Arambula who as I mentioned he has been such a champion in the assembly and we talk about so many issues that we've -- Motorcross and then shared the committee shared with us and we both fought. Tirelessly home. But to no avail sometimes things get up to the administration and and they're not supported and so -- We have a new a new a regime coming in. And hopefully a new. Opportunity cool going forward. When you talk about the transportation and? And the chairman of transportation in the assembly in California and we have a funding bill that sound after the election. Dr their seven hundred million dollars a year in public transit will look at utilizing for this population it. And trying to make sure that the Central Valley is identified because of the role nature and and making sure that the your clients and your consumers are absolutely -- Cared for so that's one thing that I will commit myself to on that [inaudible] Are you. So anyway we're gonna move on and again thank you for your testimony. A removal into a are a self advocate Caroline -- Approaches to tailor a billion Hello in. Please step [inaudible] For close. Who was pretty close -- So I'm gonna talk fast. Catcher. But I want to thank you both for having us here. And for having all of this here this is a great team we all work together for many years I want to say -- When I'm a heroes as Dr Phil and? Studies I use in my work as a social worker licensed clinical social worker valley children's. And and I'm basically I'm here because I'm a parent to what I want to do is put a face on these issues that have been spoken about. So when we talk about transportation I want you to visualize what that means and when we talk about. Things like -- Recreation what that actually means to the person because we haven't had too much of a clear picture on that yeah. So -- She has ever asked me to give you a little bit of my involvement so you know that I'm. A credible credible witness -- I collaborated with my cell unified to start the first includes a preschool program if I sell yeah. My daughter was a for students to be fully included. Twenty five years ago Tulare county school. It's a parenting resource center that's and buy sell you a similar to the one and if you. Aye road received a two point five million dollar federal grant to start us tips of program here in Fresno. Which is way finders at Fresno state for people with intellectual disabilities. Birth seedier see an S. C. DD's self determination advisory committee for the past three to four years. Founded and facilitated a parent support group for the down syndrome association the Fresno I participate in the war on the walk on Washington. With a doubt national down syndrome society to advocate to say Medicaid -- And down syndrome research and other medical initiatives that relate to our people with down syndrome other ID and all say ID to keep it quick short. I. volunteers a private consultant and advocate for parents at their child's eyed peas for those of autism and down syndrome and the Central Valley I've also been asked to be an expert witness for special education attorney here in town. And a valley children's hospital I work with children. With idea who are medically fragile and sometimes I work with parents who have ID and our regional center clients that also have children. With the ID and her medically fragile. So my biggest thing is we've heard already competitive wage wages for caregivers. The high turnover rate for carriers who leave for higher paying jobs. With almost any job being a higher rate. This for my daughter lives in a house with her two friends and staff of my daughter's home results a lack of continuity and security fell by the girls in their own home. Care givers usually work part time so that benefits don't have to be paid by the employer because of their constraints. And the move on for higher wages health insurance and other benefits many work more than one job to make ends meet. There's a lack of qualified workers also because of these low wages and they I have that and none of them have many have come to work in the girls home that have had no experience working with a person with a disability. The pay support staff that I've worked with my daughter includes these agencies respite in home supportive services independent living services supported living services. And a day program [inaudible] Housing. Housing let me give you the picture there's a lack of a poor formal housing and safe neighborhoods. Choices are limited my daughter in her to remove roommates with down syndrome are able to afford to rent and this. The same neighborhood that I live in only due to them sharing the reasonable and reduced rate. Given by the landlord and having three of them live together in the same house so they can share expensive. This would not be feasible ishe if my daughter wanted to live by herself or with one other person or in another city. For contacts they pay twelve hundred dollars a month and you heard rented a small apartment so thousand so it is a really rose reasonable rate. And that she received about. A thousand dollars a month for social security. In my job and help the couple from Kern county regional center who were the parents were -- Clients moved to be closer to our hospital at valley children's. Because they had a daughter who had ID and developmental disabilities and was medically fragile we could only find a section eight housing apartment for them. In in that part of town which we lay. Criminal activity and gangs the soon had to leave. Transportation another favorite. And I'll give you a picture of that as they will go through this for those with ID the handy right system has had ongoing problems. And with being unreliable and untimely also are handy right can't cross country county lines. So if you want to come from Clovis to valley children's hospital you cannot take the saying -- Handy right you have to switch county county. Resources. Basically there's no real transportation available those two with ID that have factors that put their safety at risk. Regional center under SLS us that the girls learn to take the city bus which I understand. But while I'm sure that they can learn to maneuver the bus system to a certain extent. The fact remains that three young ladies who are five feet tall and under. Who don't look typical are going to be targeted by others who are waiting to take advantage of them? Safety is a key issue for all of us. And on and Salas program to fight transportation I would like to see an independent company established that will cry transportation services. That's a standalone of like them see vendor through the regional center. Bet that with or without self determination that research there that resource can be accessed through our regional center. I know of two young men recently who took the city bus. One with autism and one with a AT. Who were bullied another young man with autism who was lost on the bus system because he didn't know where to get off? And his phone had died he was found hours later. I would like to speak a little bit about Central Valley regional center I have a long relationship with them. And a very good when. I think that the regional center budget not billing fully refunded has resulted in changes in processes and policies that have medical negatively affect our community which you've heard. The first of the loss of social recreation cam funding which is made a huge impact on my daughter's life and her peers. Again let me put a face on this. My daughter has to dance classes in dances for two and a half hours a week well you might say well that's an extra not everybody can do that. Let me explain the benefits of dance with this extra curricular activity and house of impacted her life. Dance is provided building friendships and socialization with her typical peers and non typical peers. Movement exercise building tone in maintenance. Promoting her physical and mental strength and this is an actively seeking help for the rest of her life this is something we all want to have. Another is a change in the behavioral services is being offered by. By -- To bother to Perrance. Well my child was in grade school age I was able to call regional center get behaviors within a couple weeks to come to my house. To help with. The beef behavior this is before the cats. This is no longer helping parents are now required to take it behavior modification class parenting class the feedback I have received that the parents are first really hesitant to go been find it very valuable. However when there's a behavior that's disrupting the whole house. The whole home family home in these to be a quicker way to get a behaviorist of this at the family before stresses hiring. And the family unit is there and I see this as a social worker and as a parent. About twenty years ago the regional center implemented a great plan to get a dozen parents. To be trained. By a behavior management agency that was from Sacramento instructor taught about six of those couples over an eight to ten week period of time I can't remember exactly. And we were given the tools together in. Tools -- To test and implement a behavior plan for a child this was done with videos group work in instruction Burke but an essence we became behavior modification Saudi. And I won't no longer called the reason center for behaviors help. I could do that on my own. Education which is my last area. Here a few of the most pressing issues with comment threads a see happening across the state I have my own experiences with bad. And her from other families in person and through other state advocacy groups that I belong. To the individuals with disabilities act IDA. That was an act in nineteen ninety is being ignored. Parents are still fighting for full inclusion I've fought for this twenty five years ago and they're still having. The same ridiculous fight. District state and there's several districts I have worked with. That they don't do full inclusion they don't give one on one support. Maybe give you a few hours are part of the day the status are policy and the policy differs from federal. Laws there's the that support the request for an inclusive setting and ideas least restrictive environment. We don't have the resources is not in the best interests of your child these are things I have heard why do you keep doing this to your child she was starting first grade. Arm. So what that's not what the parents are asking. For what they wanted their child to learn alongside their their age appropriate peers it's about learning the same material. Adapted to their needs and with necessary accommodations as required by law however even with going to fair hearing many parents lose the battle. Another problem is that most schools and teachers don't ascribe to follow us of the of assume competence. As soon confidence in our kids. They don't challenge arches his with age appropriate educational opportunities instead of her juvenile activities. I can tell you act ideas about that later. I met teachers who have taught for twenty years or more and have no training and I'm almost done. In teaching children with ID they're never taught even one child with the ID and a local school that didn't have one child with ID in their whole school. Or district they have only had kids with physical disabilities the teacher told once told me. Who's going to teach that child when she found out a child with down syndrome is coming into her kindergarten class. This just happened a couple years ago. It's important to note that students with ID are graduating with high school diplomas and taking college courses and getting real jobs. The good things we have in Fresno here's my ending. We do have I feel one of the best regional centers and I see that from all the communications I have throughout the state. They have worked well with me I feel I've been reasonable with them and they have been reasonable with me. We have the down Sonora socialization of central California break the barriers exceptional Perrance unlimited post secondary education program. Projects search brought by my good friend Michelle Smith. Part of the horse the ark Fresno. Participate our kids participate in and a day program that even focuses just on art. Something my daughter also laughs. One thing I would like to see come -- To Fresno is the Joey Travolta film camp in workshops come to the valley there in Livermore and they just started one in Stockton. Undertaking names right now and I know someone who's traveled the country working and being paid by them and she has on the intellectual disability. I thank you for your time respectfully [inaudible] Thank you. Thank you for that so we'll move on to work our next battle she won a cruise. Thank you for being here this evening. Thank you for allowing us to come here and talk about what's going on the Central Valley I'm along the crew some with the state council on developmental disabilities. This acquire region -- We cover seven counties. From Mariposa all the way down -- To current. So a little bit about me I actually came. To the Central Valley about three years ago. Have been working for the State Council. For a long time. But I was actually working for the state council in Orange County. So I've seen. The difference between what happens in Orange County and what happens in the Central Valley. And I'm gonna I'm gonna agree with you as far as working with the regional center. I've seen different regional centers county have several -- Orange County has one and it's not always as easy as it has been here so I do want to commend the regional center and I do also want to commend. All the agencies that have. Allowed me to to work with them because it has been. A very. Different experience working in the Central Valley arm the one thing I do want. To point out is the transportation I know we keep talking about transportation. But coming from. Los Angeles the Long Beach area I'd it never dawned on me how. Big the area who is here how long it would take me to get from. Fresno to Mendota didn't realize that there wasn't more than. Two lanes basically getting there so. If I struggle with my car trying to get to certain places I can only imagine what it's like to have to rely on public transportation. So a little bit about what we do our objectives is a State Council as we are we have. Twelve regional offices and again mind the Senate bill Dolly. On this the county was is pushed the temporal lobe as it independence day eight C. we are leading please what does little. To our we have the LCD is made up of thirty one people appointed by the governor. And what we do so we support systems advocacy I'll talk a little bit at what looks. We do a lot training. In the past used to be an H. B. that lottery and David Blatt see me in would go on to keep peace we would talk to we went. To for adults who needed transition program. Are we change to the way we do things and there's been some you know there's really some. The downside about changing that is that we don't really get to inner act with families as much as we used. To but we do get to fit get to find out what the what systems are working and what systems are having on issues. So we do look at innovative ways to to help -- Other agencies to try to come up with solutions. We offer resources and we have a wonderful state plan that we are look at to figure out what we need to do -- As a whole in the state or in my little area of the Central Valley [inaudible] He so again we provide a lot of training I do believe that educating our community. Is the way we are going to be able to get understand what's this is our avail. It's not John. Admit you know the point is if you know what's this is our global not into what to ask. For some time. It can be the difference. Are yours X. sometimes families don't know how to describe what's going on which makes it difficult for agencies to figure out what type of services -- That family might need -- Let's see. We do that again we do the systemic advocacy I'll talk a little bit about that. We work with the different communities different providers here that I've worked with -- And we had our this we do have the cell to self determine the state wide self determination advisory committee. So some of the gold all the goals that we address our self advocacy. We address formal and more community supports that things like home port of service. It's one agent that we have really talked about but in. That required. Twenty four seven odd type support. I'll see a new house is huge we know the house. Issue all California we know that certain areas you just can't afford to live in -- We do have that same issue here I think here. One of the biggest challenges is getting and with those developers letting them know that our population also needs housing that they need to set aside units that could house our population. Early intervention education transition and post secondary education you brought up education and I'm gonna talk a little bit about. What that is like one of the biggest issues here several school districts just? Do not believe in inclusion and inclusion you know we talk about being an inclusive society but if we can't even get a school district to agreed. To place in a child in an inclusive environment being in a regular class with. With other other children not just being in a special day class as an option you know that. That really kind of conflicts our whole inclusive environment -- A philosophy. And we do do we do a lot with health and safety. See we also ward community grants so. Just so you all know keep an eye on it I keep an eye out for our community ground. Level. On our part of the year sets and disability rights. Our other one are funny voices minutes Xin for could community living. So what I'm doing -- I think one of the big things that the special that is doing right is all into other. We are all. In the nation do you think Bob Can someone. We talk about it and it is what happens most of the time. Will get call. We'll get several calls about the image. After file because looking at houses stem vacancy. We look at it we we were is that there is a trend and at that point we might. You know talk to a director of an agency let them know this is what's going on how can we help you so that. We don't continue having to hear about these gonna these issues that are going on so I think that the Central Valley has that. We have that going for us were able to communicate were able to use each other -- I know one of the things that I want to talk about his disparities solutions like. For example room heather talked about her Brough her promoted a project. That's a big deal. In. And I'll tell you what you think it's going to be effective because they were kind enough to have me come in. And train their promote thought us on generic resources. You know generic resources is a it's an important part of services to people with developmental disabilities. It's not just. Bad -- That they're receiving services from Central Valley regional center or from the school district. The generic resources our HSS art SSI. Are -- Medi cal all those other services that that a person might require in order to be able to live in an inclusive environment. Inclusive society. Are let's see the sequoia office which is I'm a my office has. Provided IEP trading's not only. To to the Central Valley regional center staff. There are service coordinators. So that they can go out and help advocate for their clients. Let's see we've also provided trainees for Madera county mental health their therapists because they've stay actually identified a trend. With one of the dais with one of the does in Madera county regarding even. The child SS so there's trends here that are happening. And and we're helping with advocating for not only one child but just the community and in the whole. Are working together on projects like to me tomorrow we're having a huge self advocacy conference would've been so nice for you to be here. We're having a huge self advocacy conference in all of us have worked together to get this going is gonna be at least two hundred and fifty self advocates their learning about the safety piece to get safe -- And also learning about how to advocate for themselves. I do want to talk about the systems advocacy peace that we worked on so educational for example. We talked the talk include. Include and I we were. Is -- But there's a local district that it. Well the for next to do with it Bassman the oldest just clean assessments for Chau. So. In have. Command has identified my done. I'm are will be to receive. A and has been has done a that he you know there's something going on with my child. In this listing instead of you know it shouldn't have to get to this point. I definitely don't want to have to follow state complaint but if that happens you know it's gonna be because we just and come to a solution when I'm getting ten calls for the same issue. I have to do something about it. The other piece the inclusion piece we have a district that refuses to include children. And one of our cases that we identified as the systemic issues getting ready to go to the ninth circuit. Hey that's going to be December twentieth and it's really. Fun inclusion the law has always said let's include and we're still what this case has to go to the ninth circuit parents are spending an enormous amount of money. Just to get this case hard. And transportation that's the whole issue but we can talk about that solid -- Just a little bit about us and that's just that's me in Okay. And I didn't want [inaudible] Introduce our mind newest rack member my regional advisory committee member Michael ask of all who is also a self advocate. And who was gonna talk about. How you doing Sir? I bet you I bet you don't know what I'm gonna talk to you about Transportation [inaudible] He well let me just give a brief about me -- My name is Michael is given I was born in the California -- At a very young age I was diagnosed restore opposing from birth. And it was -- Heartfelt for me to go through it as through the years -- Who was the it all year round in Exeter -- But I wanted to make a difference. And I went to college the cigarettes for two years of fortunate in go my way there. But I still wanted to make it I wanted to be an advocate loading behold I worked for able industries. For the I don't know if you're familiar with able industries it's their invoice LA California they work with -- Developmental disabled. And they they have a shop inside where where the severe they they were they do -- Piece work you could say they do for the police -- The jail they make the the packets. I was one of the fortune wants to claim the parks in by so yeah. And that was in a good thing because it. It it and help me. With the disabled get to know them get. To no gets another issues that they had and their main issue was transportation. And that was. In it it was hard for me because going through the process I guy I keep telling you gotta be patients. Got to be patient a lot of times and have patience. You know you got it you got it you got to you got to have you got you just bear with me. In the unfortunately they're still around me but the issue still stands. There's a lot of people that we just can't example myself I was offered a job in point of bill. Seventeen dollars an hour at the mental health -- State the hospital janitorial. Guess what happened. One a aye aye the jobless therefore we're ready for me and a friend of my rainy. Transportation issue. The dress are the vendors did not want to transport from by Sally up all the way to prevail. Because they never the right. Ninety and that was understandable so unfortunately I lost that job. And that that was very that. A lot. In. That I had to make a difference. With the transportation issue for seven years I've been trying to push this fan to make a difference for the vendors so I can go to for it to go to Sacramento. Senate work Sacramento -- Friends. The wherever Washington remember. In the the then and now not there right now. And that's a big issue and I'm I'm hoping I'm I'm having fifteen you Mister Fisher you can take care of this. You know I've I've I've I've sent emails tomb June. Kong other congressmen Congress Kanye. Congressman. As either. Response back. Not a room [inaudible] I there are little bit. Sent on ten a big shot Governor brown can you believe that. I'll. Be said Mister brown. Well the first to call me back laughing hysterically. And he said that the the pressure. I am proud and I was going. To do something about it. I haven't heard anything about it [inaudible] Nothing more. Mister Fisher I'm. Can take care of this issue. For other people like myself. They don't have the the functions that I have. Right no I got my my beautiful rather. Transport this and this and this and that. Is given a free. At the bell you know Yeah. Yeah that's that's that's the best I can do right now. Well thank you for your time in a really appreciate you Hey I had a good. With hard to follow you Michael but if. If I can both you and you alone though are very good advocates yes we are. A perfect we work together well and a lot of situations -- I wanted to highlight a couple things and then ask for some let me just say that they don't you may say or you can take transportation as far as the bus system. But I that's fine but the thing that I'm dial a ride. Just so I can. And or whatever it's called here. But I gotta get. To I got a good time work at eight o'clock. That's hard. To and I and I think and a very long. Time I got to be patient. I don't know how long I can high I can learn and back. One of the hopes I was trying to extend to you with that -- There are multiple avenues and people to reach out. To and that I wanted to avail ourselves and our off when it's issues that are concerning us. Specifically -- I practiced in Selma which is just south of here and I know how hard it was for people to get into town. Even to get in to Fresno on to one of the things my office is. Does is we go out to the community. Just on the eleventh we were out and Carmen on the twenty fifth we're going out to Selma on November first were going to be in cal what park in and November third were going to be a maxi -- Parks's park the point I'm trying to see is if there's opportunities to collaborate with you Yolanda and I was. I was going to mention that but I ran out of time I was at the which I thought was amazing well and it is a good opportunity for us to hear from real advocates and those who are on the front lines. Who are expressing the problems that you're bring and before us today Michael and if I can one more thing please because you talked about programs and? Oftentimes get an opportunity to educate about what we're doing currently yeah but we made a change to SSI this year that. I am aware that you know people may not be as aware of which is about cashing out and that. Previously you could not be on food stamps and SS I SS P. at the same time. That has changed. The state a California's working through how we implemented but it is exciting to think that we are able to address some of the food and security. Also many within our community struggle with and so there. Are some things we can points to that are helpful and wanted to just highlight those two things. Thank you sure have a good day. So order move on to our our disability rights California -- Mayor Cruz Magdaleno. Thank you for being here this evening. Good evening thank you for the opportunity to be heard in tight le allow us to talk -- To to you guys and to our community about our agency. Are a little bit about myself I'm a new immigrant to the Central Valley. And I've been blessed with the opportunity to work for disability rights California for approximately eight years now -- More specific to developmental disabilities I am the former AC are assisting plane right side to get for the office of clients Reyes advocacy. So I am -- I a very familiar whereas -- A lot of the issues that had been presented here today. I movies of who is this ability rights California so we are the agency mandated under federal law to provide protection and advocacy. For individuals with disabilities I will be here in Fresno are very fortunate to have the local office -- It is. It is relatively small we have about seven people there -- We have advocates we have out reach people. An intake people. We also house the office of clients Reyes advocacy hallways the agency. Funded by the department of developmental services to provide advocacy is specific to people with developmental disabilities N. I'm there we have in this is a clients right advocate in assisting clients rights advocate who is here with us today Jose. Mendoza of the office of clients Reyes side because it not only works -- A specific to issues related with -- Regional center we provide a lot of advocacy. In relation to generic resources like in home supported service says -- Also -- We provide advocacy in areas like special. Basically any legal issues. That are pertaining to people with disabilities we are able to provide advocacy and needs. Not able to get directly involved to provide appropriate -- Referrals for that there are some areas of the lot when which we do not practice which is -- Personal injury of family law those are areas that we would provide referrals. For that we also provide training for parents and clients. Are in again -- Areas like special education -- In home supported services social security. I was asked -- To speak about some of the issues that we commonly see coming into our office and and I think I am not gonna. Do fair with anything that has been said here today transportation it's one of the big ones. Are we also get issues related to regional center eligibility. And lack of to lack of this thing which is. We also hear a lot about. Our services or parents having difficulties identifying the services available through the regional centered. I and I think this is more specific to monolingual Spanish speaking families. Are in another issue that we are seeing it's the community placement community -- Please ma'am for individuals with challenging behaviors and and I have to say that our regional center has been great and they have put a lot of efforts into -- The development of new community care homes for individuals that are coming out of there -- I did the disease and we just hope that that momentum would continue and we would -- Container about women as appropriate community placements for individuals who are already in the community. So -- Again thank you for the opportunity to be here and to talk about our agency out we had a hand out talks about. The R. C.'s recommendation of for the safety net of individuals with disability for anybody will like -- To to get a copy Jose has them for us. Thank you again. Thank you with that. One two public comment after doctor limb I have. Arambula some comments -- You'd mentioned housing the need of housing. How many of? Of your consumers are at risk or without housing at this point in time now. That's a good mathematical question. I know that -- We could run those numbers for you and get those sent out to you. I know I was just talking to the regional center North Bay about. I don't Santa Rosa and they were talking about they had forty five consumers and we're homeless at this point in time and several others that were at risk so it will be health yeah we have quite a number of individuals who reside on the street as well. And that we would very much like to get the appropriate housing and also they tend to have comorbid conditions with mental illness. In that the other one was just on ongoing training for your for your employees and and as a providers of mention we know that everybody in this. This community is as far as providers and the regional centers as a a pretty good turnover of employees. And what is your training into a full to make sure that the people are up to current standards -- In our doing appropriate of service to the consumer. With regard to training for our staff -- So when you begin at the central regional center you have a two week minimum -- Period where we do orientation and before we set you free we also set you up with a mentor. Of mentors someone who's worked in the field for quite a long time and supports you in the field along with your on going team there's ongoing training through the orientation period for several weeks where they come back. For but you really can't do understand till you've done them -- Such as billion for Medicaid -- Some of our computer systems -- Appeals an advocacy those sorts of things on going training we just -- Surveyed our staff for priorities for training and we have monthly training at a minimum that's offered to our service coordinators for everything from. Health issues -- Such as the importance of shall I said. Making sure that Bosnia properly -- I know that's not an appropriate topic on one hand but on the other hand it is imperative to people's health and out at risk of high death if we don't manage that properly. And we also work on many other concepts -- Not just medically related but also related to advocacy we doing adolescence of your mindset the State Council comes into strains for us. On I EPS another collaborative trainings we also have annual training surround mandated reporting and those sorts of things. So just one other question so I know there's it a differential and adult service coordinators and and the the motor service corners what is the average. Senses that you're coordinators in adult and minor actually service. Right now were at one to sixty eight which is -- Lower compared to our peers in the state -- But those numbers are rising. Overtime. Thank you doctor and questions taking and public comment I wanted people to know to relax a little bit. To know that we're here to listen to you as your public servants. I'm glad we're in my backyard. And so please take the time that you need to tell your story -- It's a wonderful opportunity for us to hear from you and I just look forward to the public comment. Do for public comment is all I ask you to stand. In line in the aisle and we're gonna give you. Approximate two minutes to try to to give us your your your mission will also as I mentioned will have time afterwards what I will tell you in this advocacy that you're doing.

And I've learned that the managers are also Ridley available. They are approachable and they have a desire to resolve any concerns that I may have. I will give you one example. Jeff had attended a creative arts program for he learned to be a stage performer. And at and arts and I after about. Seventeen years of this program I received started receiving calls from the program manager about Jeff acting out. Jeff for sherry the cookie at lunch against rules. Jeff was not coming in a bad area day against roles. And so I said to Jeff Jeff what's going on Jeff being the Wiseman he said. I need a new boss. So I said I can't change that but you can go someplace else. And he said I can. I was so pleased I call the regional center. The case worker returned my call. The next day I explore. She was knowledgeable bill out every sort of program Jeff could attend. In the Tulare county area. She set up appointments for me to go to these different places. I narrowed it down. To one then we took Jeff. He loved it and he said I want to go there and the case worker sat down with him and says this means you have different friends you have different transportation. Your life will be different. He understood because she took time to talk to him the person. And then this is a work program so the now Jeff has a paycheck. He's excited to earn thirty dollars a week he's a proud man in fact he said to his dad one time dad. I'm a man I have a paycheck. But we have a couple speakers we have to be out here okay so -- Basically I found a CV RC to be people who care and people who want to help. They've been responsive.

We deal with that part of society that's considered broken. Were forgotten. Or their swept under the rug. And and I'm glad that we have. You guys to come and actually say this though. All I wanna say is we need more money for these [inaudible] Programs -- So they don't get swept under the rug they don't get forgotten and they're not looked at as broken. So we need more money. And more years like you guys thank you. Looks like this will be our last. Please my name is Reza way moan and I live in Fresno -- I'm just gonna be repeating a lot of what everybody is sad -- I'd like to tell you a little bit about my daughter. She's thirty six years old she works she works at a place that -- Values her gifts she's a big contributor there and they would miss her she wasn't there -- She's also looking for more work all the time. As other people to make ends meet she lives in our own home. And she's active in her community there. She probably knows more neighbors than I do she does favors for them and they look after her -- She balling she's done volunteer work -- She shares her own story in fact should be at the conference on Thursday -- Participating in a panel -- She belongs to clubs she's now the president of a club that she is active in and none of this happens without the support without the support of the agencies that are represented here today. They've all played a part -- All the advocacy agencies that are here State Council disabilities rights. Regional center -- Has has. Just I would echo what the young man said I'm not sure what we would have done without them -- And then that this would have happened for her -- The community needs people living with a disability to be part of the community. And one of the things that I I want to and with is that -- Regional center has now committed to becoming a person centered thinking agency. I have the privilege to be a part of that project. And the user trainings that are ongoing for the staff there's internal activities for the staff to keep. The vision going. Of person centered planning. And the trainings are not just for the staff in the air it's equally as important that is for the community. So these trainings are given out in the community for parents for providers. And for anyone else that unity -- So we can see an inclusive hold community in Fresno thank you. I think I'm gonna let you have the floor for a minute so you can. To show your feelings. We will start if I can to thank everybody who came but specifically the mother from kings park if I could -- Your comment about your son ending with you his day being perfect -- Reflects the feelings I have about today as well. There's times we can lose faith in our democracy in what we do by. What we hear? But there are moments like today that I'm reaffirmed in what it means to make our communities better. It's by advocates like you. Who come forward and give voice to the problems and the disenfranchised? And it's up to us the servant public service to do something about it. And so I look forward to the opportunities to working collaboratively with all of you who are here. No I hold hearings through the year and sub one and hope I see many of you continuing to be advocates in that form as well. We need all of our forces we need to all be rowing in the right direction and working together. Without I just wanted to thank again you Mister chair for agreeing to hold this hearing here. It's imperative that we in the valley feel like we get heard. And I heard from many of you today and was moved by what I heard. So thank you for making this a perfect day. With that -- I am blessed to serve in the assembly with doctor Arambula who is so passionate about. The human being -- Coming to him as the chairman of someone in being able. To share with him some of the issues that I've run across and he's been so support of one of the reasons that. We were able to be able to work on this committee together and a passion for the people that you and I and the doctor okay all care about -- I can't thank you each and everyone of you enough for being here. And sharing with us how we can better advocate for you also. Remember. Your voice is being heard. We are going to advocate on a higher level but what I will share with you. As I mentioned dyslexia bill. When we were going to the process of getting this bill? Through the committees. The advocates the mothers showed up. There was a hundred mama bears in this committee where these lime green. T. shirts and you think any those committee members we're going to opposed does mama bears. You got to be the momma bear and Papa bear. In those committees. That's how you're going to get things pushed through legislation we need your help also. We can be the voice. And we can be the the quarterback with the ball. Be your the force to be reckoned with. We represent you. No I have six more years the doctor has eight I believe -- Left into in the assembly. And to tell you the truth -- I'm gonna commit my next six years and most of my legislation to this community. So working together. We will be able to address the needs. And do it on a task with tactful. Unemotional business like level to go back towards. The ministration tell them at another has enough. And as the one gentleman had -- Mentioned swept under the rug will not happen ever again on my watch. I look forward. To provide we have a survey on my website for the intellectual developing disabled how your dealings with and not to pick on the regional centers but we want to know how the providers. How the the regional centers approach providing for the families? And we want to know how we can actually support more through funding in and and other processes to go forward so we look for you addressing the website and and doing the survey. But we're going to seven more of these hearings throughout California. In December -- Dropping legislation in last socially challenged each and every member of of the legislature in the assembly.
