01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:14.729
NEEDS THAT WE HAVE AT THE

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:16.764
FAIRGROUNDS- SO WHILE THEY GET

01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:18.900
WHILE THEY'RE OLD- THEY THEY

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:21.769

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.871
LOOK AT THEM FAILING HOWEVER.

01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:26.507
THAT SAID. WE ARE BEGINNING TO

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:28.042
COME TO END OF LIFE ON A LOT OF

01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:29.644
THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES AND

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:31.446

HAVING THAT MANY FAIRGROUNDS

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:34.282
ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:36.284
EVENTUALLY WE ARE GOING TO NEED

01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:38.620
TO REPLACE THOSE- PEOPLE ON HIM

01:27:38.686 --> 01:27:39.921
