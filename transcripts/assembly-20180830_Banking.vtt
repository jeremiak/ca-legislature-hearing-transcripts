HERE WE JUST HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:31.077
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHETHER THIS

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:32.545
IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:33.980
I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST JUST TRY

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.515
ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:37.617
KNOW IN A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:41.520
DON'T KNOW --

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:43.189
THIS BILL WAS HERE BEFORE THIS

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:44.657
BODY -- JUST

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:46.325
ABOUT A YEAR AGO --

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:47.894
AND THERE WERE LOTS OF QUESTIONS

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.996
AND CONCERNS LEGITIMATELY SO --

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:53.933
THIS BILL SEEKS.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.534
TO TAKE A PARTICULAR LENDERS

SPECIALIZED TREATMENT THIS IS A

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.608
SINGLE COMPANY BILL AND I DON'T

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:03.743
BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A DEBATABLE

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:05.711
POINT --

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:07.880
THIS COMMITTEE WILL NOT HAVE ANY

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:09.348
INPUT.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:10.116
ON WHAT THIS BILL SHOULD LOOK

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:11.817
LIKE WE DON'T THINK THAT'S

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:12.852
NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY TO DO

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.254
POLICY.

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.089
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LOANS

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:18.124
THAT ARE MADE BY FINDERS

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.459
CURRENTLY.

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:21.961
ARE UNDER THE TWENTY FIVE

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:22.595
HUNDRED DOLLAR CAPSULE WE DON'T

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:23.729
BELIEVE THERE IS ANY COMPELLING

00:09:23.796 --> 00:09:25.364
REASON.

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:26.666
TRIPLE THE SIZE OF THE LOANS

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.668
THAT CAN BE DONE UNDER IT.

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:30.136
NO DATA FROM THE REGULATOR

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:31.871
APARTMENT BUSINESS OVERSIGHTS.

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.005
WE JUST THAT THERE'S SOME

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:35.441
CHALLENGING PIECES RELATED TO

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:36.842
LOANS THAT ARE ORIGINATED BY

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:37.843
FINDERS ONLY JUST PROVIDE A

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.112
COUPLE OF THEM.

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:41.247
DB A DATA SAYS THAT ONLY SIX

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:43.649
PRINTS 16% OF THE LOANS.

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:45.751
THAT ARE MADE OF BY FINDERS

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:47.753
UNDER THE PILOT ARE DONE IN LOW

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.422
TO MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES.

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:51.223
AS OPPOSED 263% A LOANS

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.859
ORIGINATED BY NON FINDERS --

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:56.696
THE POINT OF THE PILOT WAS TO DO --

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:58.097
TO GET ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:00.232
CAPITAL IN UNDERSERVED

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:00.866
COMMUNITIES AND WE DON'T WANNA

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.301
THINK THIS DATA SUGGEST THAT

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:02.835
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING WITH

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:04.136
FINDERS.

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:05.638
THE DATA SUGGEST THAT COULD

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.773
SCORE BUILDING THAT HAPPENS --

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.408
OUT WITH FINDER LOANS IS

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:10.776
DRAMATICALLY LESS THAN THE

00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:11.377
CRITICAL THE CREDIBILITY THAT

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.279
HAPPENS OUT WITH LOANS MADE BY

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:15.047
NON ORIGINATED ONCE.

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:16.282
SO THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WE

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:19.318
DON'T KNOW IS I'M.

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:20.619
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WITH THESE

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:21.954
FINDERS ARE INTERESTING AND

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:23.990
COLLECT A COLLECTION OF OF FOLKS

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.658
THEY INCLUDE PAYDAY LENDERS

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:26.759
CHECK CAPTURES.

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:29.595
A FURNITURE STORE OF A GOLD A

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:31.964
GOLD BUYING PLACE THAT SO THAT'S

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.232
ALWAYS KIND OF CONCERN JUST AS

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.100
WELL BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.434
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON THAT WE

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:36.369
DON'T KNOW.

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:39.305
IF PILOT LOANS ARE BEING USED AS

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:40.606
YOU KNOW THE BAIT IN A BAIT AND

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:42.074
SWITCH WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:45.244
CROSS SELLING GOING ON WE WE

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.746
DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS ENABLING.

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:47.680
AND THIS HASN'T REALLY BEEN

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:48.481
LOOKED AT AND NOW WE'RE GONNA

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:50.282
TRIPLE THE SIZE THE LOANS THAT

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:52.418
HAPPEN HERE --

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.053
AT THIS POINT I THINK THAT'S

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:54.520
SUFFICIENT WE'VE WE'VE

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:55.721
