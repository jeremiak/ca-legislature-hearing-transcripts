AND CONSUMER PROTECTION TODAY IS JANUARY FOURTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE A TOTAL OF FIVE BILLS ON THE AGENDA AND TOOL OF WHICH ARE ON THE CONSENT AGENDA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA IS GONNA BE JOINING US LATER HE'S GONNA BE SUBBING FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL SINCE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM WE COULD PROCEED AS A- SUBCOMMITTEE SINCE I HAVE A BILL SO I. VAST VICE CHAIR TO CHAIR THE MEETING WHILE I PRESENT MY BILL IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. THIS IS. THANK YOU SIR. HARRY. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I LIKE TO START OFF BY A- AGREEING TO THE AMENDMENTS LISTED ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS OF THE AMENDMENTS WILL ESSENTIALLY AND SURE THAT THE BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO EXPAND THE AUTHORITY OF A GOVERNMENT ENTITY TO USE SOFTWARE FOR SURVEILLANCE OF THIS BILL AB NINE OH FOUR AS CURRENTLY IMPRINTS SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT ENTITIES CANNOT USE TRACKING SOFTWARE. THAT PERMITS THE TRACKING OF THE MOVE MOVEMENT OF A PERSON OR OBJECT WITHOUT A WARRANT. A CURRENT LAW REQUIRES A SEARCH WARRANT BE ISSUED BEFORE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER CAN INSTALL A TRACKING DEVICE OR SERVING A WARRANT. ON A THIRD PARTY POSSESSOR OFF THE TRACKING DATA HOWEVER WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY IT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR THE OFFICER TO MAKE PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH A DEVICE. PERSON OR VEHICLE TO INSTALL A DEVICE IN ORDER TO TRACK AN INDIVIDUAL. ON THE CONTRARY THEY SIMPLY NEED TO HAVE WIRELESS ACCESS TO DOWNLOAD TRACKING SOFTWARE THAT WILL PROVIDE INVESTIGATORS WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THE SEEK. SINCE CURRENT LAW DOES NOT EXPLICITLY DEFINE THE TERM DEVICE THERE IS AMBIGUITY WHETHER THE DEVICE HAS TO BE A MECHANICAL DEVICE OR NOT. SO THIS BILL WOULD CLARIFY THAT A TRACKING DEVICE INCLUDES ANY SOFTWARE THAT PERMITS THE TRACKING OF THE MOVEMENT OF A PERSON OR OBJECT FOR PURPOSES OF THE STATUE. OF SOME OF THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED THE CONCERN THAT THE BILL UNDER THIS BILL WE ARE GRANTING NEW POWERS SO TO GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. ARE THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN FACT THE AMENDMENT THAT I REFERENCED EARLIER WILL ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. ON EVER DOES NOT AND I'M COMMITTED TO A CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO- HAVE- ALL REFINED THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE IT BETTER SO WE GOT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SO NOT NOT EXACTLY OPPOSITION AT THIS POINT- KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- WORK ON THIS AND THE AMENDMENTS ARE WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING TO SEE IF THEY FULLY ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS BUT LOOK FORWARD TO. WORKING WITH HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE ADDRESSED. THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER. ALL SECONDS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WE NEED A QUORUM TO US YET GOOD POINT WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT ON THE. MOTION AND SECOND BUT FOR THE TIME BEING. MR CHAO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU MUCH. ALL RIGHT AND- WE WILL- GO AHEAD AND THAT HAVE TO WAIT TO HAVE A QUORUM TO VOTE ON THIS. THANK. YEAH SEE MR GRAYSON- IN THE ROOM SO- MISTER GRAYSON IF YOU'RE READY TO PRESENT YOUR BILL THE FLOOR WILL BE YOURS AND WELCOME MR GRAYSON HAS ITEM NUMBER TWO EIGHTY SIX NINETY NINE. THAT'S ON CREDIT SERVICES ORGANIZATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES THIS AFTERNOON I BRING FORWARD AB SIX NINE NINE RELATED TO CREDIT SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS BEFORE I START I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY OFFICE TO IMPROVE THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS OF THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S BEEN A DELIGHT WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF CHAIR. AS YOU KNOW CREDIT SERVICE ORGANIZATION OFFER TO REPAIR A CONSUMER'S CREDIT FILE EXCHANGE FOR PAYMENT. TYPICAL SERVICES INCLUDES SCORE ANALYSIS. ZERO CHALLENGES AND CREDIT CREDITOR INTERVENTIONS HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW INSTANCES WHERE THE SERVICES LACK DISCLOSURES OF WHAT SPECIFIC SERVICES A CONSUMER IS PURCHASING AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES ON WHAT A SCARE SO HAS ACTUALLY DONE ON BEHALF OF THE CLIENT. CONSUMERS ARE LED TO BELIEVE THAT BY SIMPLY HIRING THE SEA- THE CS SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CLEAN UP THEIR CREDIT FILE AND IMPROVE THEIR FINANCIAL STANDING HOWEVER. IS THE FACT THAT NOBODY CAN ERASE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF LEGITIMATE UNPAID BILLS DEBTS OR BANKRUPTCY SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS BILL IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS MEDIA STORIES ABOUT THE COMMON PRACTICES OF THIS INDUSTRY AND THE CONSUMER PROTECTION FINANCE BUREAU HAS FILED SUIT AGAINST TWO OF THE LARGEST CREDIT. AND THE CFPB HAS ALSO ISSUED A- IT'S THREE ABOUT THE INDUSTRY TO BE CLEAR THE AIM OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO SHUT DOWN LEGITIMATE CREDIT REPAIR AGAIN THIS BILL IS NOT TO SHUT DOWN LEGITIMATE CREDIT REPAIR CLEARLY INACCURATE INFORMATION CAN GET INTO A OR ONTO A CONSUMER'S CREDIT FILE AND NAVIGATING THE PROCESS OF REMOVING THAT INFORMATION CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING. AND TIME CONSUMING WITH AB SIX NINETY NINE WE ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE INFORMATION TO KNOW WHAT SERVICES THEY ARE PURCHASING AND WHAT ACTIONS A REPAIR ORGANIZATION IS TAKING ON THEIR BEHALF WHILE I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL DOES HAVE SOME OPPOSITION FROM THE CREDIT REPAIR INDUSTRY I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE HAD DOCTOR THINGS AND I THINK WE'RE HAPPENED DOWN THE- RIGHT TRACK. WANT TO CONTINUE TO. THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS IF IT WAS TO GET OUT OF THIS- COME TODAY. WITH THAT IN MIND I WOULD LIKE TO CLEARLY STATE THAT I AM COMMITTED TO AMENDING THE BILL AS NOTED ON PAGE TEN OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS FOR THE MORE. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE YOUR STAFF TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES RAISED IN COMMENT FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS. SPECIFICALLY THAT WE WILL WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE FURNITURE OR A FURNITURE- TREAT ANY COMMUNICATION FORM OF THE C. S. O. SENT ON BEHALF OF A CONSUMER AS DIRECT COMMUNICATION FROM THE CONSUMER THEMSELVES. I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL WILL LIKELY REQUEST NEW. APPOINTMENTS TO PARAGRAPHS BOTH IN V.

THANK YOU JOINING YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- CLIFF BURKE HERE IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS IN SUPPORT OF AB SIX NINE NINE WE BELIEVE AB SIX NINE NINE IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS IN THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS COMMUNITY BOTH FROM UNSCRUPULOUS PRACTICES OF CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY CERTAIN PRACTICES OF THE REPAIR INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN PROBLEMATIC FOR A LONG TIME AND QUê NHà IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY OR CALIFORNIA WILL PLACE YOUR ACTED THE CREDIT SERVICES ACTIVE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHICH DECLARED THE LEGISLATURE FARMS IN THE CLEAR HERE'S CERTAIN ADVERTISING AND BUSINESS PRACTICES THEMSELVES CREDIT SERVICES ORGANIZATION. I WORKED A FINANCIAL HARDSHIP UPON THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE THE PURPOSE OF THIS TITLE ARE TO PROVIDE PROSPECTIVE BUYERS OF SERVICE CREDIT SERVICES. NATION'S WITH PATIENT. INTEL DECISIONS REGARDING PURCHASES OF THESE SERVICES AND TO PROTECT PUBLIC FROM UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING AND BUSINESS PRACTICES AND QUOTE UNFORTUNATELY. PROBLEMS WITH THE CREDIT REPAIR INDUSTRY REMAIN TODAY FRONT PAGE NEWS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU THE CUES COMPANIES OF VIOLATING THE LAW COLLECTING ILLEGAL FEES DECEPTIVE PRACTICES IN CHARGING CONSUMERS WITHOUT DELIVERING RESULTS. AB SIX NINE NINE PROVIDES THE FREE FIRST MAJOR UPDATE AND EXPANSION OF CALIFORNIA STATE PROTECTION SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AB SIX NINE NINE REQUIRES CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH INFORMATION ON SERVICES PERFORMED BEFORE CHARGING CONSUMER REASONABLE TIMELINES TO PREVENT ENDLESS CHARGES FULLER DISCLOSURE OF CONTRACT TERMS BEFORE A CONTRACT IS EXECUTED. IN A LISTING OF REGISTER CONSUMER REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS ON THE WEB. IMPORTANTLY FOR CREDIBILITY OF THE PURPOSE PROCESS AB SIX NINE NINE REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE REAL SENDER OF THE COMMUNICATION. THIS WILL PREVENT CIRCUMVENTION OF THE ACT AND PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY IN KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS BEING DONE IN THEIR NAME. UNFORTUNATELY TODAY OFTEN WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OR AUTHORIZATION. AT THE END OF THE DAY AB SIX NINE NINE PROTECTS CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES FROM PRACTICES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS RECOGNIZED AS TROUBLESOME FOR MORE THAN FOUR DECADES. WELL IT IS GOOD NEWS THAT THE C. F. P. B. AND THE FTC ARE TAKING ACTION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT LEAVE PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB SIX NINE NINE. WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF OTHER COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHERS TO AMEND THE BILL LAST WEEK TO ENSURE THAT AB SIX NINE NINE IS FAIR AND REASONABLE TALL LEGITIMATE CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS.

NO ONE HERE IS INTERESTED IN ANYBODY OUT OF BUSINESS OR MAKING THEIR BUSINESS MODEL ON WORKABLE IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA FROM UNSCRUPULOUS PRACTICES AND WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE I HAVE HERE WITH ME- CINDY AKLAN WHO IS THE LEAD SHARE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS.

THANK YOU WELCOME AND MR CHAIRING FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU- AS CLIFFORD MENTION I'M CURRENTLY MY NAME IS CINDY OFTEN I'M CURRENTLY SERVING AS LEGISLATIVE CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS AND I AM ALSO A SECOND GENERATION COLLECTION AGENCY OWNER WITH AN OFFICE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I'M AB SIXTY NINE IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS AS A DIRECT RESULT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY OUR MEMBERS IN ON BEHALF OF COLLECTION AGENCIES NATIONWIDE. EACH DAY. COLLECTION AGENCIES RECEIVE BASS GENERATED LETTERS FROM ZEROS ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS DISPUTING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES FOR SIGNED ACCOUNTS. HUNDREDS AND IN SOME INSTANCES THOUSANDS MAYBE RECEIVED BY OUR MEMBERS. EACH LETTER APPEARS IN THE SAME FORMAT TYPESET AND REQUEST VALIDATION AND DOCUMENTATION FOR THE REPORTED ACCOUNT AND OR A DELETION FROM THE CONSUMER'S CREDIT FILE. THE LETTERS ALL CONTAIN A WET OR ORIGINAL SIGNATURE OF THE CONSUMERS NAME THE DISPUTES ARE PROCESSED BY OUR MEMBERS AND VALIDATION IS MAILED AT THE CONSUMER REQUEST. CONSISTENTLY OUR MEMBERS HAVE REPORTED THAT CONSUMERS DID NOT ACTUALLY DISPUTE THE AMOUNT ASSIGNED. THEY HAVE INDICATED THAT THE SIGNATURE IN THE LETTER IS NOT THEIR SIGNATURE. THEY'VE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AND ANGER AS THEIR CREDIT SCORE DID NOT INCREASE AT THIS THIS ZERO HAD REPRESENTED. THEY HAVE PAID FOR SERVICES TO A C. R. O. WITH NO RESULTS. THEY'RE UNAWARE THAT THE LETTERS ARE BEING SENT ON PAID ACCOUNTS. AND MULTIPLE LETTERS ARE MAILED AT THEIR COST FOR ACCOUNTS PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED. ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS EIGHTY SIX NINE NINE IS INTRODUCED BY ASSEMBLYMAN TIM GRAYSON AND SPONSORED BY SEE AC TO REVISE THE EXISTING NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR ACT INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIS YEAR AS- WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR AYE THAT TODAY THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON VANESSA GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF ENCORE CAPITAL IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MUCH. OPPOSITION PLACE COME ON UP. IF I COULD ASK YOU TO MAKE WAY FOR OPPOSITION AB ONE OF YOU. WELCOME HERE I GET AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN HI MY NAME IS RUNOFF DAYLAMI WITH NELSON MARKS MURDER HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENT LEXINGTON LAW WITH ME TODAY AS LEXINGTON'S COUNCIL ERIC CAMERA AT WHO IS HERE TO SPEAK BRIEFLY REGARDING HOW LEXINGTON OPERATES- AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU. THAT YOU MAY HAVE. FUNDAMENTALLY AS A DSL OR CREDIT SERVICE ORGANIZATION WE ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS LEGISLATION EIGHTY SIX NINE NINE. TRUTHFULLY AS REPRESENTATIVES OF CONSUMERS AND DISPUTES AGAINST DEBT COLLECTORS IT'S A LITTLE ODD DEFINE OURSELVES AS THE TARGET A CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION WERE OP THAT SPONSOR STAND TO BENEFIT IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL AND HELPING THE CONSUMER IN THE PROCESS OF DISPUTING AND REMOVING ARONIE US ARE OBSOLETE DEBT. FROM THEIR RECORDS BUT HERE WE ARE- WE KNOW THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO BE ONE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION- SO WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT CONSUMERS DO BENEFIT FROM CREDIT REPAIR SERVICES. AND WE AGREE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT AND A LEGITIMATE GOAL OF SUCH LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE CLARITY TO THE CONSUMER ABOUT WHAT SERVICES THEY'RE GETTING HOW THEY'RE GETTING THEM WHEN THEY'RE GETTING THEM- AS WELL AS GETTING UPDATES ON THOSE SERVICES JUST AS IT JUST AS IT IS AN IMPORTANT AND LEGITIMATE GOAL TO PROVIDE APOTEX THEIR PRIVACY. BY REDACTING THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION- OF COURSE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T ADD PUT THIS YES SO IN A BIND BY REQUIRING THEM TO REDACT INFORMATION AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE THE FULL INFORMATION- SOMETHING THAT WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE- PALACES AND- DROP. WHAT WE DON'T BELIEVE WOULD BE APPROACH IT- ARE PROVISIONS CLEAR. MIND TO ROAD ABILITY OF CSOS TO DO THEIR JOBS- THAT SAID WHERE WE ARE TODAY IS IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION THAN WHERE WE WERE. EVEN YESTERDAY SO BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER. I JUST WANT TO STOP AND SAY WE REALLY THANK MISTER GRAYSON THE AUTHOR OFFERS HARD WORK AND WE THINK THE COMMITTEE. I'M HERE TO STAFF SPEND A- LONG AMOUNT OF TIME MORE THAN AN HOUR LAST WEEK SITTING DOWN WITH US GOING THROUGH THE BILL IN DETAIL. THROUGH ALL OF OUR CONCERNS EACH OF THE PROVISIONS THAT WE FELT THAT WERE INTENDED TO PERHAPS HELP THE CONSUMER BUT POTENTIALLY HAD UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT- WE ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. FOR AN EXCELLENT JOB AN ANALYSIS. FOR HIGHLIGHTING MANY OF THE SAME ISSUES THAT CLEARLY AND CONCISELY- WE THINK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE AMENDMENTS- THAT THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED HERE TODAY- WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS HAVE. REALLY TAKEN OUT MANY OF THE PROVISIONS THAT WE FELT WERE DESIGNED TO HELP THE DEBT COLLECTORS AND NOT TO PROTECT THE- CONSUMER AND HAS SIGNIFICANTLY MOVE THE BILL IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SELL BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS TO STAY HERE TODAY WE WERE AND THEN OPPOSE POSITION WE ARE MOVING TEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. SO THAT WE THINK THE AUTHOR AGAIN- THE REASON WE REMAIN AND OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED A POSITION VERSUS OUR FAVORITE TWEEN OR POSITION OF. CONCERNS IS BECAUSE WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE DIRECTION IT HAS TAKEN BUT THERE IS A THE BIGGEST ISSUE IN THIS LEGISLATION STILL REMAINS AND WE FEEL IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE- FIND RESOLUTION ON THIS AND- THIS IS THE ONE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT ON IT WE'RE THANKFUL BUT- IS WHAT I WILL CALL THAT DO NOT IMPERSONATE POTS AND THE- FIRE. ITSELF AS SUBDIVISIONS AND ENVY OF SECTION THREE. I'M I WANT TO BE CLEAR AGAIN THAT WE ABSOLUTELY TAKE AUTHORED A BIRD. THAT IT IS NOT HIS SCHOOL TO SHUT DOWN CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S AS INTENSE. BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT'S THAT FACT OF THOSE TWO SUBDIVISIONS RIGHT NOW- SO WERE EXTREMELY HARD BY ITS COMMITMENT- BACK AND WE ARE. APPRECIATE THAT THE ANALYSIS- INCORPORATE THAT CONCEPT. OF A REQUIREMENT OF THE DATA FURNITURE- AS TREE ANY COMMUNICATION FROM A CSS SENT ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER AS A DIRECT COMMUNICATION FROM THE CONSUMER THEMSELVES. WE THINK IT'S CRUCIAL AND NOT COMING TO A RESOLUTION ON THIS ISSUE IS FOR LACK OF A BETTER PHRASE IT'S THE WHOLE BALL GAME- STE. THE FACT THAT CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS ARE FACED WITH THIS CHOICE. IT'S NOT IDEAL IT'S NOT ANYONE'S IEA ALL IT'S A CREATURE FEDERAL LAW. BY ANY REPRESENTATION THAT THEY DO THIS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND AUTHORIZATION OR CONSENT TO THE CONSUMER. IT IGNORES THE FACT THAT CSOS HAVE CONTRACTS WITH THEIR CLIENTS IT'S JUST NOT TRUE THEY'RE NOT OUT THERE ACTING ON BEHALF OF THEIR CLIENTS WITHOUT ANY AGENCY OR BECAUSE OF ANY- ANTI CONSUMER INTENT. I IT'S NOT NECESSARY YES THEY DO THIS BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T THE DEBT COLLECTOR FURNITURE AS THEY'RE CALLED UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATIONS. THEY COULD TAKE THEIR LETTERS AND PUT IT TO THE SIDE THERE WOULD BE RENDERED INEFFECTIVE IN REPRESENTING THE CONSUMER WHO HIRED THEM. IT'S HIGHLIGHTED THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THE FURNITURE'S ONLY OBLIGATION TO INVESTIGATE A DISPUTE IS WHEN THEY GET A DISPUTE FROM THE CONSUMER THEMSELF THERE'S AN EXPRESS EXEMPTION. FOR AT THE FURNITURE'S OBLIGATION TO INVESTIGATE IF THERE'S A REASONABLE BELIEF THAT THE DISPUTE WAS REPAIRED ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER BY OR- SUBMITTED BY A CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATION THAT IS. AND BLACK OR WHITE LETTERS SO WHAT THIS DOES IT GIVES SOME CERTAINTY THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO HAVE A REASONABLE BELIEF AND IN VEGAS UNCERTAINTY. SO THAT SAID WE KNOW THE AUTHOR IS MADE THE COMMITMENT WE ABSOLUTELY KNOW THAT HE WANTS TO GET THE LANGUAGE RIGHT. WE WANT HIM TO GET IT RIGHT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM TO HELP YOU GET THERE. WE SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT WERE ACTUALLY PART OF THE SOLUTION- AND WITH THAT MR TERABITS OKAY WITH YOU- I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY CLIENT JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTES- I THINK. IF YOU'D RATHER HAVE AN JUST ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS OF NOTHING ELSE- I THINK MY CLIENT DISAGREES WITH THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE LAWSUIT AND IF HE COULD JUST SAY A WORD ABOUT THAT THAT WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED I KNOW IT TOOK A LOT OF. TIME PLEASE DO. WELCOME THANK YOU- YES WHAT I'D LIKE TO MENTION A FEW POINTS ON THE LAWSUIT- THAT WE'VE HEARD NOW TWICE- THERE IS NO ALLEGATION IN THE LAWSUIT THAT PEOPLE DID NOT RECEIVE THE SERVICES THAT THEY CONTRACTED FOR- THAT IS NOT A PART OF THE LAWSUIT- THERE IS A BILLING QUESTION THE CFPB HAS AN INTERPRETATION OF LAW THE DELAYS BILLING FOR SIX MONTHS AND THE ALLEGATION IS THE BILLING OCCURRED PRIOR TO SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES- SOMETIMES THAT GETS CONFLATED WITH AN- UP FRONT FEE THAT SUGGEST PRIOR TO THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES. EXISTING FEDERAL LAW AND CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES THAT SERVICES BE DELIVERED FIRST AND BILLING OCCUR LATER- SO IT NEITHER OF THOSE CHARACTERIZATIONS AS ACCURATE. YEAH IF I MAY LIKE TO PRIDE JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON. WHAT THE SERVICES ARE THAT WOULD BE TO HELP MAKE IT. YES JUST BRIEFLY. THIS COMMITTEE IN PARTICULAR I THINK IS. IMPORTANT COMMITTEE FOR THIS MATTER- NOT BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE AMENDMENT BUT BECAUSE CREDIT. REPORTING IS FUNDAMENTALLY A PRIVACY ISSUE. IT'S ABOUT OUR DATA IT'S ABOUT THE WAY OUR DATA FLOWS BETWEEN DIFFERENT BUSINESSES AND IT'S ABOUT HOW THOSE BUSINESSES USE THAT DATA. FUNDAMENTALLY OUR WORK IS TO INSERT CONSUMERS INTO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THEM THAT OCCURS RELATIVE TO THEIR DATA. AND SO AT ITS CORE THE WORK THAT WE DO IS ABOUT PRIVACY WHAT PEOPLE CAN SAY ABOUT US AND HOW WE CAN INTERVENE IN THAT MATTER WE SPECIFICALLY FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON THE THREE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES THE INFORMATION THAT APPEARS ON THOSE CREDIT REPORTS. AND PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH TOOLS SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE SURE THAT INFORMATION IS NOT ONLY ACCURATE BUT THAT IT IS FAIR AND THAT CAN BE SUBSTANTIATED BECAUSE IF PEOPLE ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT US AND ABOUT OUR DATA. THEY BETTER HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION TO DEMONSTRATE WHY SOMETHING% APPEARS ON A CREDIT REPORT AND WHAT THE JUSTIFICATION IS THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE DO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO BILL PLEASE COME ON UP AND IDENTIFY YOURSELF. SEEING NONE NOT SLL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I KNOW GO AHEAD MISGUIDED GOT THAT EMOTION. YES BILLS BEEN MOVED. GO AHEAD MISS KILEY SO THE KEYS FOR THE OPPOSITION IS THIS DO NOT IMPERSONATE PROVISION AND SO- YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT IN LAST THE C. R. O. USES THE NAME OF THE CONSUMER AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CONSUMER THERE'S NO OBLIGATION UNDER FEDERAL LAW- FOR THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES RESPOND IS THAT RIGHT. OKAY SO. IF IT WAS A LOT OF THE SAID THE YOU KNOW- THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION AND SAID ACTING AS AN AGENT OF ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER WHY WOULD THAT NOT WORK. BECAUSE THEN THEY HAVE CONFIRMED THAT HEY ARE NOT THE CONSUMER AND SO UNDER THE EXEMPTION UNDER FEDERAL LAW. THEY DON'T THE- FURNITURE DOESN'T HAVE A DUTY TO INVESTIGATE THERE'S AN EXEMPTION. IS THE EXEMPTION DEFINITIVELY DOESN'T APPLY TO THE AGENT OF THE- OF THE CONSUMER IT LITERALLY SAYS IF THERE IS A REASONABLE BELIEF THAT SOMEONE IS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER. OR THAT THEY ARE THAT IT IS BEING FOR FAST SUBMITTED BY A CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATION. THEY DON'T HAVE TO. FIVE RESPOND THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THE INVESTIGATIONTHE SAME MANNER THEY WOULD WITH A CONSUMER DISPUTE. I SEE IS THAT THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE AUTHOR OR SUPPORTERS. SO WE'RE WORKING ON- TRYING TO TIGHTEN UP LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE AND OF COURSE- CLIFFORD CAN GIVE ANSWERS WELL BUT WE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ADDRESSING. IN THOSE TWO SECTIONS THAT I MADE A COMMITMENT ON TRYING TO FIND LANGUAGE. THAT WOULD TIGHTEN THAT UP TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE OUR INTENT IS NOT. TO AN ABLE- THERE TO BE NO RESPONSE. GOOD ARMED I MEAN IF I WOULD AGREE WITH THEM IN THE I THINK THE AUTHOR HAS WILL SET IT. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT YOU KNOW IS A SPONSOR OF THE BILL THAT WAS NOT OUR INTENT. YEAH WE'RE NOT SURE THE LAW REALLY WORKS THE WAY IT'S BEEN TO DESCRIBE CLEARLY FEDERAL LAW. REQUIRES US TO RESPOND TO A CONSUMER WHEN THEY MAKE. IT WHEN THEY CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OF IT YET BUT IT THAT REQUIRES A RESPONSE AND THAT THE WHOLE. YOU VALIDATING THE DEATH SO WHEN YOU GET THOUSANDS OF WROBEL LETTERS THAT WERE NOT ACTUALLY SIGNED BY THE CONSUMER. AND YOU'RE PUTTING IN PLAY THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE MAIL AS WELL AS CREATING WORK WE'RE TRYING WE'RE TRYING TO. DO NARROW DOWN WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. ARM. TO SEND A LETTER. TO DISCLOSE WHO THE ACTUAL CENTER IS SPEAKS TO ENFORCE THE LAW AGAINST WHAT'S ACTUALLY PROVE IT IN THE LAW HE SERVE ACTUALLY NEED TO KNOW WHO SENT IT. BUT BUT- IT'S NOT OUR INTENT NOT TO RESPOND SO THE IT YOU KNOW. THE ASSERTION THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO RESPOND IS OF COURSE BOTH IS A MATTER OF OUR A CHANCE. WHICH THERE'S NOTHING A LIMITS ARE. THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD LIMIT. US RESPONDING THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST WILL SAY WE'RE NOT REQUIRED TO YOU WHAT WE HAVE SUGGESTED IT IN THE RECEIVED IN HIS EARLY. IS A- DUPLICATIVE OR STATE VERSION OF THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS JUSTIN BUT THEIR CONCERNS AT REST. BECAUSE IT IS NOT OUR INTENT TO USE THIS. TO AVOID RESPONDING. I'M JUST. THAT'S NOT A REASON FLYER SAYING YOU HAVE A STATE VERSION OF THAT REQUIREMENT THAT EXTENDS TO SOMEONE ACTING AS AN AGENT OF THE CONSUMER RIGHT. IN WHICH THIS YEAR BECAUSE AGAIN WE'RE- MISTER GREAT IN AS THE AUTHOR CLEARLY. IS HAS COMMITTED TO WORK WITH THIS WITH THE VERY BEST PARTY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO THAT. YOU KNOW THIS AREA THEY DESCRIBE DOESN'T HAPPEN I SAY IT IS NOT OUR. GOAL TO MAKE TO HAVE. HAPPENED SO. THIS OUT IN FOR THE OPPOSITION OF ROBO LETTERS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS ACTUALLY DO IS THERE A LEGITIMATE PURPOSE OF THIS HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT. I THINK I GOT A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED THERE I THINK THE SUBJECT OF THIS WAS TO HELP THE CONSUMER AND NOT TO. REDUCE THE WORKLOAD AT THE DEBT COLLECTOR SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON. I THINK THE NUMBER OF LETTERS IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF THINGS TO DISPUTE. SO BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT YOU'RE DISPUTING WITHOUT THERE BEING A REASONABLE BASIS TO BELIEVE THAT IT MIGHT BE DISPUTABLE AS THAT THE ALLEGATION FROM. JACK LET ME CALIFORNIA ON THE CLEARED FACT THE OLD THE EXISTING LAW THAT YOU CAN ADVISE YOUR CHARACTERIZATION. YOU CAN ADVISE SUMER TO DISPUTES. THOUGHT SOMETHING THAT YOU OTHERWISE NO IS NO IS VALID. ARMS SIMILARLY THERE IS IT THERE ARE DEBTS OR CREDIT. THAT GETS PAID PAID OFF THAT IT'S ALREADY BEEN RESOLVED IN WHICH WE STILL GETTING LETTERS CHALLENGING SO I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE HOST. AND I CAN BRING SEND TO THE COLLECTION AGENCY PERSON BACK UP HERE LET ME JUST SAY THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS WHY A LOT OF THE LETTERS THAT ARE SAD. ARE INACCURATE. ARE NOT CARAFES- THERE TEND TO BE A TEMPLATE SO THESE ARE NOT INDIVIDUALIZE LETTERS. WHEN WE HAVE A OF THE LETTERS THAT WE THEY'RE ALL THE SAME LETTER THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS FOR CONSUMER. TO CONSUMER. NAME IS JUST STAFF WIDER IF THAT. AND OUT ALLERGY THANK MMHM SO OKAY I DO YOU GUYS WATER RESPONSE ARE ADDED ME TO INVITE BACK AND FORTH. NO WHERE IN MY COMP PRESENTATION OF ANY PARTICULAR COMPANY YEAH I'M JUST TELLING YOU WHAT THE INDUSTRY PRACTICE ARM WALL. TROUBLING AND I THINK I MADE IT CLEAR IN MY PRESENTATION OF THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO HELP CONSUMERS AND THE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WHICH IS WHY YOU SEE SUCH BROAD BUSINESS SUPPORT FOR THANK YOU LET'S HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION AGAIN ONE. EIGHT SO I THINK THERE ARE TWO POINTS TWO QUESTIONS. ONE QUESTION THAT YOU MADE IS- IS THERE A BASIS FOR SENDING LETTERS AND I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION AND THEN THE IDEA OF USING TEMPLATES REFORMS. SO WITH RESPECT TO A BASIS FOR US. AN APPROPRIATE BASIS UNDER THE LAW IS SUBSTANTIATION. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT CONSUMERS OFTEN HAVE NO SENSE OF WHO A DEBT COLLECTOR IS WHAT THEIR BUSINESS NAME IS THEY SIMPLY SEE AN ITEM ON THEIR CREDIT REPORT. AND SO OFTEN THE QUESTION THAT WE POPE WAS IS WHO ARE YOU WHERE THIS COME FROM LISA THE NTA CREDIT REPORT. NO ASSERTION IT'S NOT TERRACE IT'S BEST TO GET. THE SECOND POINT THIS NOTION OF THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY WRONG WITH USE THAT TEMPLATE THE DEBT COLLECTORS AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE SEND EVERYTHING AS A TEMPLATE THE ONLY THING THAT CHANGES IS THE INFORMATION FROM THE CONSUMER. AND SO THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY WRONG WITH US USING APPROVED TEMPLATES FOR THE SAME PURPOSE- I THINK IS A SPECIOUS ARGUMENT IT IT MAKES NO SENSE ATTORNEYS USE TEMPLATE ALL OF THE TIME THERE'S NO REASON TO REINVENT THE WHEEL THERE'S NO- THERE'S NOTHING NEFARIOUS ABOUT USING A TEMPLATE AND USING THE SAME LETTER FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. AGAIN IT'S THEY DO TIME AND TIME AGAIN. NUMBER THAT I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU THAT FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFTER THE FACT AND IT'S TOO LATE FOR THIS COMMITTEE OBVIOUSLY BUT FOR PURPOSES OF THE FLOOR- WILL ALSO SEE THAT THERE IS. A PROVISION TALK ABOUT FRIVOLOUS OR OR RELEVANT DISPUTES THERE ARE WAYS OF HANDLING THINGS IF YOU THINK THERE'S NO BASIS FOR SOMETHING WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS GETTING IN THE FRONT DOOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I BELIEVE OUT OF THE RUBBLE LETTER SITUATION HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BY ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS- TAKEN. AND THAT PLACES THE BUT ESSENTIAL PLACE THE BURDEN ON THE- SEE A SOUL TO VERIFY THE INFORMATION IS NOT OBSOLETE IN. AN ACCURATE I THINK THAT'S THE OF AMENDMENT NUMBER THREE ITEM THE MICHIGAN BUT I ALSO AGREE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S PROBLEMATIC TO PROVIDE A FRESH. NEW WHERE THE INFORMATION IS COME QUICKLY FROM THE FROM THE CONSUMER VERSUS YOU KNOW ON BEHALF OF THE INSTRUMENTS SO I THINK THAT HAS TO BE FIXED. SO I'M GLAD THAT THE AUTHOR HAS AGREED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT- AND- YOU KNOW SO LONG AS- I HAVE YOUR COMMITMENT AND I'M I'M I'M OKAY WITH. THE WITH THE BILL GOING FOR A MISS SMITH GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE AS WELL INTENTIONED AS THIS BILL IS IN AROUND CONSUMER PROTECTION IS THAT IS. IN THIS ETIRE SPACE OF CREDIT AND CREDIT REPORTING. THE CONSUMER. A SENSIBLY HAS NUMEROUS PROTECTIONS OF BOTH THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE LEVEL ALL OF THOSE PROTECTIONS HOWEVER ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS THEIR ABILITY TO BE ENFORCED ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER. AS CONSUMERS WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN THE SITUATION NEED OF THESE SERVICES. ARE PRBABLY THE LEAST LIKELY AMONG ALL CONSUMERS TO HAVE THE BAND WITH. TO THEN PURSUE ADDITIONAL LEGAL HELP AND SUPPORT AS NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR% RIGHTS ARE BEING PROTECTED. SO I WOULD SAY THAT RELUCTANTLY I WILL SUPPORT TODAY BUT WHAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE ADDED AS THE FINAL PIECE BEFORE IT COMES BACK TO US FOR A FINAL VOTE WOULD BE. THAT ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT AND IS IT MEANINGFUL AND IS IT EASILY ACCESSIBLE BY CONSUMERS IN THE INTENT- YOU KNOW WITH WHICH YOU AUTHORED THE BILL. SO. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I DO WANT TO ADD THAT THE I DO RESERVE MY RIGHT TO CALL THE BILL BACK IN THE EVENT THAT IT DOES NOT GET ADDRESS A- OR ANY OTHER ISSUES THAT MAY COME UP BETWEEN NOW AND- WHENEVER. SAID I APPRECIATE THAT. IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. JUST SIMPLY- MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU AGAIN FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD AND COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR HEARING IT FOR THE GOOD QUESTIONS. IWANT TO THINK OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE HAVE HAD- SO- SUBSTANTIAL DISCUSSIONS WE'VE COME A LONG WAY SOME OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY WE'RE JUST RECENTLY BROUGHT UP TO THE POINT THAT WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO DO SOME DUE DILIGENCE- HOWEVER THROUGH COMMITMENTS AND WILLINGNESS TO BE ABLE TO BRING IT BACK- IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO. A SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND ADDRESS ISSUES ESPECIALLY ENFORCEMENT WHICH WE HAVE STARTED TO DO AND PENALTIES AS WELL AS WORKING WITH THE AG'S SELL WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE. THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED UP AND YOU TO IN. A BILLS OUT THE MOTION. TO APPROVE CAN A MAN SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHAU HI I KILEY BY KILEY AYE POWER A HAND. FOR ME.

RETURN TO WORK. FOR THE TEAM MISSED AND THANK YOU AND YEAH THIS IS OBVIOUSLY REALLY IMPORTANT OF. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I DIDN'T SEE ADDRESS WAS THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF WHAT'S- AGENCY USES THOSE- SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS BECAUSE OF COURSE AT THAT LIST WOULD BE A GREAT LIST FOR- HACKERS TO HAVE FOR A HE USED TO HAVE SO IT IS YOUR INTENTION TO MAKE THE LIST. CONFIDENCE WE HAVEN'T- BUT- IF YOU'VE GOT ANY IDEAS AND- MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF IF YOU'VE GOT ANY IDEAS ON ON SOME LANGUAGES INTO THE BILL FORD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT AT ITS IT WOULD BE AT NOT GREAT IF THE- PRESS.
