MY NAME IS ALEX CRONIN A LICENSED PHYSICAL THERAPIST A GRADUAL FRESNO STATE WERE ALSO PLAYED FOUR YEARS SINCE AS A STARTER ON THE TENNIS TEAM. I'M ALSO THE FOUNDER OF SAFE TECHNOLOGY FOR SANTA ROSA AND AFTER YEARS OF HARD WORKING COMMUNITY SUPPORT JUST LAST WEEK SANTA ROSA PASSED TO PROTECT THE SMALL CELL ORDINANCE. WIRELESS OF ANY G. IS THIRD RATE. CHEAP BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE FAR INFERIOR TO FIBER OPTIC OR CABLE SERVICES. DIRECTLY TO HOMES. WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT RELIABLY FAST ENOUGH AND NOT SYMMETRIC THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPT TO UNDERSTAND. IT MUST HAVE THE SAME SPEED UP AND DOWN WHO SAYS THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY IN THE JUNE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR BROADBAND CORONAVIRUS RECOVERY FUNDS. WIRELESS BROADBAND CAN'T MEET THIS STANDARD ACCORDING TO OKALOOSA BE CHECKED IN PC MAGAZINE IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE FIVE G. IS NO FASTER THAN FOUR G. IT'S A SYMMETRIC UPLOAD SPEEDS ARE A SMALL FRACTION OF ITS DOWNLOAD SPEEDS. WHAT IS NEEDED FOR FEDERAL BROADBAND FUNDING IS A HUNDRED MEGABITS DOWN AS WHICH WHAT I RECEIVE. AND A HUNDRED UP IS WHEN I SEND OUT. ONLY CABLE OR FIBER TO THE HOME CAN DO THIS WIRELESS CAN'T RELY WE DO THIS IT IS NOT FUTURE PROOF. AS WE CONTINUE TO REQUIRE MORE MORE BANDWIDTH FOR ECONOMY AND EDUCATION IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR WIRELESS TO KEEP UP WITH THIS DEMAND. WIRELESS USES MICROWAVE RADIATION A PROVEN CARCINOGEN IN THEIR- TALKS IN IMMUNO SUPPRESSOR. THROUGH THE AIR TO SEND AND RECEIVE DATA ABOUT FIBER OPTICS USES VISIBLE LIGHT THREE CABLE TO SEND AND RECEIVE DATA DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WIRELESS AND FIBER OPTIC FREQUENCIES ARE A MILLION TIMES. THIS MEANS FIBER CAN CARRY A MILLION TIMES MORE DATA THAN WIRELESS CAN'T. AB FIVE THREE SEVEN IS A DEEMED APPROVED NIGHTMARE FOR LOCALITIES IT WILL PUT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST OUR CITIES AND LOCALITIES. AND COUNTIES. LOCAL BERMAN CENTER OBLIGATE TO DELIVER ACTUAL PUBLIC SAY. AND ENJOYED MINISTRIES CAL. DO NOT WANT NAY. THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS FLOODED WITH CELL TOWERS OUTSIDE THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS DO YOU SENATORS. SENATORS PLEASE UNDERSTAND SEC SHOT CLOCKS FOR SO CALLED SMALL CELLS ARE RULED BY THE NINTH CIRCUIT TO BE PRESUMPTIVE ONLY THAT MEANS THEY'RE NOT THEIR STATEMENTS OF FCC PREFERENCES THEY ARE NOT FEDERAL LAW.

I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- HAVE A FEW. QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR- AND I WORKED. IN THE PAST A WITH THE AUTHOR SO I APPRECIATE. THE DEPTH WITH WHICH TO GO INTO THESE ISSUES- ONE IS ABOUT THE FIRST ISSUE IS ABOUT- OF THE SHOT CLOCK IN THE TIMING- ONE IS. IF THE PARAMETERS FOR THE SHOT CLOCK HAVE BEEN SET. WHY PURSUE LEGISLATION- ON THE SAME ISSUE. WELL THIS ALL STARTED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN I WAS SITTING IN THE AND- A MEETING. ACTUALLY WEAPON ARE DONE BY THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN THE RECENT SHOT CLOCK THE WITH STEP BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WHAT THE PERSON DID THE BRIEFING CARE WAS. ARM YEAH THIS IS A SHOT CLOCK BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT THEY HAVE TO SUE YOU. TO ENFORCE IT AND THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO SUE YOU SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT THERE WAS IN FACT POINT THAT I DECIDED WE SHOULD HAVE A REMEDY- AND IT WAS MY IDEA THAT IT WOULD BE DEEMED APPROVED% THAT WAS ME. AND WENT ON FROM THERE AND IT DID BECOME LAW. OKAY- YOU MENTIONED OR A MENTION WAS MADE OF THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS WHO HAVE RAISED ISSUES OF SAFETY- AND SO HOW DO YOU HOW ARE YOU ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE ARE REGARDING THE SAFETY RISKS THAT THE- THAT MIGHT BE IMPOSED OR MIGHT BE YEAH- THAT WORKERS AT THE PUBLIC- WHAT WOULD HAVE TO FACE- AND IT SEEMS TO BE THAT WE'RE GOING EVEN FURTHER THAN THAT- WELL. LET ME JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT SO- THE THING WHEN WE WORKED WITH THE AND I'M VERY PROUD AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND RURAL COUNTIES WORKING WITH THAT. BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING. ARE CONCERNED WATCHING IN FACT SAFETY AND BY THE WAY REMEMBER C. W. WAY- LOCAL NINE ONE ONE NINE- THE- THE CONCERT IS BOTH WORKERS WHO WOULD BE OUT TO THE RIGHT OF WAY AND OF COURSE- DISRUPTION OF TRAFFIC FLOW AT CETERA. SO WHAT WE'VE SAID IS THAT WE WANT THE CITIES TO COME UP WITH THE FLAM WE'VE ASKED THEM TO DO IT- WITHOUT DELAY BUT YOU KNOW. WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO PLAN I WANT TO PLAN I KNOW THE COMPANIES WANT TO PLAN THE WORKERS WE NEED A PLAN FOR THEIR SAFETY AND THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE BILL AND THAT'S WHEN THE CITIES AND THE RURAL COUNTIES DROPPED THEIR OPPOSITION AND BECAME NEUTRAL SO I THINK WE'VE ADDRESSED THAT IF ANYONE FRANKLY BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN IT GOES TO THE SENATE FLOOR IT SAYS THAT- THERE'S ONE OF THESE TRAFFIC SAFETY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT MATTER FACT. I BELIEVE IN THE MEMBERS WE SUGGESTED WE ALSO GOT SOME ADDITIONAL WORDING IN THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY SAFE WITH REGARD TO RIGHT OF WAY AND TRAFFIC AND ALL THAT OKAY WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME AMENDMENTS OR LANGUAGE PROPOSED BY ACWA SOUGHT PRE SHEET IF YOU WOULD YEAH LET THAT THEY SENT. TO US YESTERDAY YEAH WE HAVE BEEN. WE CONTACT THEM WITH SAME TIME WE DID THE LEAGUE OF CITIES IN THE WORLD COUNTY THEY'VE NEVER AGREED TO MEET WITH US WE'VE ASKED THEM. YESTERDAY THEY THREW A BUNCH OF AMENDMENTS THAT IS FRANKLY THAT'S NOT SERIOUS. IF THEY'RE SERIOUS COME AND TALK TO US THERE'S TIME BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN IT GOES TO THE SENATE FLOOR. OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU YES AND THE LAST ISSUE- I BROUGHT THIS UP ON WITH OTHER BILLS- AND THAT IS THE- THE ISSUE OF EQUITY- MANY TIMES THESE BILLS- INCLUDING YOURS MAKE REFERENCE TO- COMMUNITIES OUT IN CALIFORNIA THAT. JUST HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT ON MEANT. YOU KNOW HAVE NOT BEEN AT PAR WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES AS FAR AS ACCESSIBILITY- AND RELIABILITY ON THIS WAS OF COURSE- BROUGHT UP EVEN MORE DURING THE PANDEMIC- WHICH AFFECTED THEIR LEARNING. OF OUR CHILDREN SO. IT KEEPS COMING UP BUT THERE IS- NOT ALWAYS IS THERE AN EXLICIT REFERENCE ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS- OR HOW THIS. IN FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS BILL THAT IT WOULD ADDRESS THE DID DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR THE MOST UNDERSERVED SELF COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE AGAIN. THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME YOU KNOW I'VE ASKED ABOUT THIS QUESTION OF DONE IT ON OTHER BILLS AND THE AUTHORS HAVE- THEN TURNED AROUND AND MADE AN EFFORT TO BE MORE EXPLICIT SO SHALL WE HAVE A TELEVISION ASSEMBLY AND SENATE AVENUE. ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE RIGHT NOW. SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET. ARM IT'S FOUR BILLION FOR WHAT THEY CALL MIDDLE MILE WHICH WOULD BE PREDOMINANTLY BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE OUT TO THE RURAL AREAS VETS. HAVE PROBLEM IN THE CITY'S FANS TO BE. THERE IS A SIGNAL IT'S JUST TOO EXPENSIVE. AND FOR THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT LIFELINE FOR YOUR CELL PHONE ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR CELL PHONE ON A LIFELINE YOU CAN THEN ATTACH A CONTRIBUTOR SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IN THE URBAN AREAS THAT'S THE LIFELINE IS THERE. I'VE ALSO WORKED IN THE PAST AS WE NEEDED MORE AND MORE- THE CONNECTION FOR STUDENTS DURING THIS LAST YEAR AND A HALF. TO GET HOT SPOTS SET UP BY A. T. AND T. COMCAST AT CETERA SO- WE NEED TO. WE HAVE A FAILED TO DO THIS IS CELIA. ARE IN THE- CECILIA AGUILAR CURRY IS THE AUTHOR IN THE ASSEMBLY. LENA GONZALEZ IS THE AUTHOR IN THE SENATE- THESE WILL ADDRESS THE DIGITAL BOUGHT DIVIDE BY GETTING- BOTH. OUT TO THE RURAL AREAS WHERE THERE MAY BE NO INTERNET AT ALL AND THEN ALSO IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN AREAS WHERE YOU'VE GOT FIVE FAMILIES TO OUR- TO OUR HOUSE. AND THE BUDGETS ARE LOW AND THEY NEED THAT LIFELINE RATE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON IN THOSE BILLS AND- FOUGHT OVER IT MEETING TODAY AND MATTER OF FACT AT ONE O'CLOCK WITH THE GOVERNOR. OF GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- TO WORK OUT FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. WELL I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT- TO LOOK AND SEE IF THERE'S- LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE EXPLICIT ABOUT IT- BUT MORE POORLY IF YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO RAISE THIS BECAUSE- THERE'S A LOT OF PIECES I KNOW TO THE BROADBAND DISCUSSION. ON THIS FUNDING INVOLVED IS A LOT OF PIECES BUT SOMEHOW THE SERIOUSNESS TO ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES IS NOT THERE AND THERE'S A LOT OF FLUFF LANGUAGE. LEFT LANGUAGE DOESN'T HELP OUR COMMUNITY SO I'M JUST RAISING IT TO YOU AND I ARE NAY SHAKE YOU TAKING US SURE WE HARD LINE ON IT YEAH WE HAVE A SUMMARY OF WHERE THE ASSEMBLY POSITIONS ARE RIGHT NOW. AND I'LL HAVE MY STAFF SEND IT TO YOUR STAFF AND YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING THAT'S THE VEHICLE FOR ADDRESSING THIS THROUGH THE BUDGET THROUGH THAT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND THROUGH WORKING THIS THE SYSTEM FRANKLY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENATOR AND THANK YOU SOME NUMBER- WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT IS A ADDITIONAL. OR HE HEARING TINA THERE A MOTION TO APPROVE. SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER DRAWS ON THE FLOOR. FINAL CALL FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS. HEARING TINA FROM COMMITTEE SUPPORT PROJECT CLOSE PLEASE ARM ARE WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMENTS WE SPENT AN HOUR DISCUSSING THIS YESTERDAY WERE MEETING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TODAY WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY BOTH SATURDAY GONZALEZ AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER ID ARE VERY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I APPRECIATE OUR OUR COLLEAGUES OF PATIENTS TODAY KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON. LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING THE CHEERING YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF OR YOUR IMPRTANT AND SIGNIFICANT WORK ON THIS BILL- HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO STREAMLINE. USE POLICY REPORTING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CLARIFY THAT MILITARY EQUIPMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE GENERAL COMMENT THAT'S NOT PROHIBITED BY THE DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY. THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENTS REGARDING USE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR I KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR STATE OUR OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT IN A POST GEORGE FORD WORLD WE DO NEED TO CONSIDER HOW EQUIPMENT AND TACTICS IMPACT THEIR PARTNERSHIP. OUR STATE IS LED THE NATION IN THE AMOUNT OF MILITARY WEAPONRY OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS PROCURED TO THE TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT LINK BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND WEAPONS OBTAINED BY POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE NUMBER OF POLICE SHOOTINGS. THIS PAST YEAR OUR STATE SAW AN ALARMING RANGE OF EQUIPMENT IN ACTION DURING PEACEFUL PROTESTS WHEN POLICE SPRAY TEAR. GAS FROM MILITARY GRENADE LAUNCHER IS AND SHOT ROBERT. FROM VEHICLES. THE DECISION OF HOW TO. THE SENSE OF EQUIPMENT. WERE LEFT UP TO IN. OFFICERS AT THE SCENE WITHOUT UNIFORM PROTOCOLS. THIS BILL ASKED LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO WORK WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND GOVERNING BOARDS TO COME UP WITH APPROPRIATE MILITARY EQUIPMENT USE POLICIES THAT CAN BE DELIBERATED AND APPROVED IN PUBLIC SETTINGS. THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN AND WHY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BELIEVE THEY NEED MILITARY CALIBER EQUIPMENT ESPECIALLY WHEN PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE AT STAKE IN AT THIS TIME I LIKE TO TURN IT OVER. TO OUR WITNESSES THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A MEMBER CHU SO LACING GENTLEMEN HEARING COMMITTEE- AND- WATCHING ONLINE WE HAVE TO LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES WHO WOULD BE PROVIDED TWO MINUTES EACH AT FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'RE GONNA GO TO BRIANNA SO I FULLER- AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO CASEY SHORT.

GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE CHAIRED MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS BRANDON PLACE WHERE I AM AN ATTORNEY WITH FIVE NOBODY ELSE YOU KNOW. AND I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF WOMEN'S FOUNDATION CALIFORNIA. THE CROWD COSPONSORED ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR EIGHT ONE. CALIFORNIA POLICE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN MILITARIZING FOR DECADES WITH LITTLE TO NO OVERSIGHT. THROUGH ONE PROGRAM THE TEN THIRTY THREE PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA POLICE HAVE REQUIRED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT. INCLUDING MINE RESISTANT AMBUSH PROTECTED VEHICLES. UNMANNED GROUND VEHICLES ASSAULT RIFLES AND NIGHT VISION SNIPER SCOPE. OTHER FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE ANY REPORTING BUT A CATALOG LIST EVERYTHING FROM ARMORED VEHICLES TO NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. ALL THIS ALL THIS EQUIPMENT BEG THE QUESTION WHO IS THE ENEMY POLICE ARE TRYING TO COMBAT. A TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY FOUND MILITARIZED POLICE FORCES WERE MOST OFTEN DEPLOYED IN BLACK COMMUNITIES EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR CRIME RATES. AND SEVERAL STUDIES FOUND SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN INCREASED POLICE MILITARIZATION AND INCREASED POLICE KILLING. FOR ALL OF THAT HARM THERE IS NO BENEFIT. STUDY SHOWED POLICE MILITARIZATION FAILED TO REDUCE CRIME SALES TO ENHANCE OFFICER SAFETY AND FAILED TO SUPPORT A PUBLIC TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS BILL PREVENTING EASY SEX POLICE AGENCIES ALREADY REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT PLANNED PURCHASES DURING THE ANNUAL BUDGET REVIEW PROCESS. THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DETAIL ABOUT THE EQUIPMENT FOUGHT FOR THE USE POLICY BEFORE POLICE CAN BRING IN THE MOST EXTREME WAR LIKE EQUIPMENT INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS IS A MINIMAL ASK OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS. PLEASE MAKE CLEAN THE NEED DISAPPOINTMENT WE ARE JUST SAYING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE A VOICE. AB FOUR EIGHT ONE IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION TO ADVANCE RACIAL JUSTICE REDUCE POLICE VIOLENCE AND INSERT BASIC TRANSPARENCY MEASURES. ALL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INCLUDING THOSE HEADED BY ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT THIS BASIC PRINCIPLE OF GOVERNMENT MUST BE IMPLEMENTED WITH REGARD TO A QUICK MEANT ORIGINALLY MEANT ABOUT PEDOPHILES THIRTY SECONDS EVERY SEXUALLY ARE YOUR EYES OUT.

I AM A BLACK MALE- I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT USING MILITARY WEAPONS AUTOCOCKERS DON'T WANT MENTAL. ABILITY YOU COULD BE IN QUESTION BECAUSE LIKE THEY'RE ALREADY THE ENEMY. WHO A POLICE REPORT. SO IN ORDER TO CREATE CHANGE TO CRUELLY CREATE CHANGE. I'D SAY GIVE YOU TO PLEASE PAT. AB FOUR EIGHT ONE IN ORDER TO CREATE A GAP BETWEEN THE PEOPLE. AND THE POLICE. IF YOU WERE OUT OUTSIDE TO ASK PEOPLE TO DATE THEY DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE POLICE REPORT AT ALL. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT POLICE ARE OFF TO TREAT AGGRESSIVE TOWARD. PROTESTERS IN GENERAL.

IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED SB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE A SIMILAR BILL. THAT DID NOT GO SO FAR AS TO REQUIRE GOVERNING BODY APPROVAL FOR THE ACQUISITION OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT. IN HIS VETO MESSAGE ON THAT BILL. HE STATED THE CURRENT LIST NOT ONLY INCLUDES ITEMS ARE CLEARLY MILITARISTIC AND STYLE BUT MANY THAT ARE COMMONLY USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DO NOT MERIT ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO THEIR ACQUISITION.

BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT- SUBSTANTIVE INTEREST OF THESE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES- THEY ARE ALL WE ARE ALL INTERCONNECTED AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR SENATORS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH WHERE THIS IS HEADED BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT. WE'VE BEEN DOING SO MUCH WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO WORK ON HOUSING QUESTIONS OVER RECENT YEARS AND FOR THE SOME OF THE STREAMLINING EFFORTS AT BOOM. ON EVEN MODEST PROPOSALS EIGHTY YEARS A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING OTHER HOUSING TYPES. SOME OF THOSE OF OR FIND A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUT HAVE YET TO ACTUALLY WORK ON. THE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT PROCESS WHICH IS THAT. UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION WHICH OF COURSE LOOKS AT LAND USE AUTHORITIES WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE. RELATED TO THAT AS YOU ALL PROBABLY KNOW WHEN THE COASTAL COMMISSION WAS ENACTED BY THE VOTERS AND THROUGH THE COASTAL ACT GIVEN THE POWERS THAT THE LEGISLATURE GATE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. IT ACTUALLY HAS PURVIEW OVER AFFORDABLE HOUSING QUESTIONS AND WORK REALLY HARD. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PRESERVING EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK IN. LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. IN SOME OF THOSE VERY SAME COMMUNITIES AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE MIXED INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT CAN SUPPORT. OUR WORKFORCE AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. ACROSS ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND NOT HAVE EXCLUSIONARY AREAS THAT ARE JUST. REALLY GETS HER OR AVAILABLE FOR ONE SUBSET OF THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION THAT'S WHY WE LOOK AT THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS. ACROSS ALL OF OUR JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA BUT BECAUSE- OF SOME OF THE- TECHNICAL DETAILS THAT WE FIND WITHIN THE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT PROCESS IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE. WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE COMMUNITIES AREAS WHERE PEOPLE COME TO WORK. TO BE ABLE TO BE A PART OF. THOSE COMMUNITIES. AT SOME OF THOSE VISITORS SERVING ACCOMMODATIONS BUT HAVE. SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES NOT BEEN ABLE TO REALLY HAVE SOME OF THESE INTEGRATED QUESTIONS AROUND HOUSING. THROUGH SOME OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S ALREADY ESTABLISHED LAND USE THE WORD EXCEL WE HAVE A LOT THAT'S EMOTION THIS BILL HAS DEVELOPED IT HAS ACTUALLY GOTTEN A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THE TABLE. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS IS ONE OF AGREEMENT I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. OVER THE COMING FOUR WEEKS AS WELL. TO BE ABLE TO PUT SOME FINE. TUNING ON TO THIS I REALLY WANT TO THANK ON THE CHAIR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. AND ESPECIALLY THANK ANTON SEVERINI SORE ABOUT FOR ALL THAT HARD WORK OUT THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE. I'D LIKE TO PRESENT A FEW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SARAH CHRISTIE THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION. AND BILL PRINCE LUCKY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF PEOPLE ORGANIZED. FOR WESTSIDE RENEWAL. THANK YOU SO MY JOB GRATEFUL I SIMPLY MEMBER ALL RIGHT TO LAY. CHEN OUT WE ARE GOING TO. TAKING THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE HUNDRED. WE WANT TO REMIND FOLKS YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES WE'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROMPT AS YOU'RE COMING UP ON THAT TWO MINUTES. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'RE GOING TO BE STARTING WITH THAT. DON'T COUNTY RESIDENT SARAH CHRISTIE FROM THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION IS CHRISTY AS ALWAYS WE WELCOME YOU COMMITTEE. YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN MORNING MEMBERS- AFTERNOON MEMBERS I'M SURE CHRISTY WITH ACOSTA COMMISSION WHICH HAS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED THE CLUB FOR GROWTH. I WANT TO SAY THE COMMISSION WORKING INTENDED USING REAL TWENTY NINE TEN. TO PROVIDE MORE TIME TO NEGOTIATE CONSENSUS LANGUAGE THAT WILL ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS WHILE STILL ACHIEVING THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CALLS ON. THE COMMISSION SHARES THAT GOAL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO A PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE IT A REALITY. I'D LIKE TO USE THE BALANCE OF MY TIME TO TERRIFYING ISSUE IN A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REGARDING THE COMMISSION'S RECORD ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING LIKE. THAT THE SEVEN TO NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE. AS STATED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN CULTIC MUST REPORT THE COMMISSION APPROVED THE CONSTRUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND BEACH SECURE PORTABLE UNIT. WITHIN THE MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS APPROVING AT THAT TIME. AND PRIVATE PREVENTED THE DEMOLITION OF THE- ANOTHER ELEVEN HUNDRED. PAPA COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ALSO REFERS TO A DIFFERENT STUDY THAT ESTIMATED THE COMMISSION ONLY REQUIRED THE CONSTRUCTION OF BETWEEN SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN AND FIFTEEN SIXTY UNITS DURING THAT TIME. THAT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY ACADEMIC ARTICLE BY ROBERT JOHNSON SEE MORE SPORTS PUBLISHED IN THE COASTAL MANAGEMENT JOURNAL. WHICH WAS ALSO CITED AND RELIED UPON IN THE COMMISSION TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORT. THE LOWER NUMBERS ONLY CAPTURE THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS BUILT IN LA. ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THIS NUMBER IS A SUBSET OF THE THREE THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN APPROVED AFFORDABLE UNITS REQUIRED IS BECAUSE THE PERMIT CONDITIONS ENOUGH COUNTY. WHICH IS ALSO MENTIONED IN THE JOHNSON SCHWARTZ REPORT. THE STUDY'S AUTHORS ESTIMATED THAT THIS NUMBER REPRESENTS 63% OF THE TOTAL. STATEWIDE WHICH MEANS IF YOU DO THE MATH. THE CULTURE COMMISSIONER CHOIR. FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO UNIT. SEVENTY SEVEN EIGHTY ONE. A STUDY AND- FOR FIFTEEN OR- ALL REFERENCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE NOW FROM. SECOND RECORD MARC FISHER. ONE EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR UNITS BEEN APPROVED AT THE TIME OF ITS RIGHT. THIRTY NOT A WORD THE ACADEMIC STUDY TO THE COMMITTEE CONFLICTING THE COST OF WHICH IS NOT ACT CAN. THE APPROVAL OF OUR PRODUCTS FIVE UNITS. THE REASON THE NUMBER OF UNITS ON THE GROUND IS LOWER THAN THE NUMBER. PRINTED BECAUSE THE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE NOW ACT IN ADDITION TO AUTHORIZING THE DEMOLITION OF COASTAL HOUSING EXPERT IF YOU NEED OUT OF THE CAUCUS ON. ALSO OPERATE DEVELOPERS TO GET OUT FROM UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS REQUIRING THEM TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE MARKET PROJECT. NOT BECAUSE OF REQUIREMENTS RENDERED THEM ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. I BRING THIS UP AT THE POINT OF VERIFICATION AND TO PROVIDE CONTEXT TO WHAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE TWO REPORT.

HEALTH CARE DISTRICT IS A COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH CARE DISTRICT AND PITTSBURG BAY POINT. THE PORTIONS OF CLYDE. CLAYTON IN ANTIOCH. IT WAS FORMED IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT WITH THE PURPOSE OF OPERATING THE LOS MCDONALD'S COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THE HOSPITAL CLOSED DUE TO BANKRUPTCY AND IS NOW BEING LEASED TO THE CONTRA COSTA. COUNTY OP OPERATING AS A PITTSBURG HEALTH CENTER. THE DISTRICT HAS CEASED PROVIDING DIRECT CARE TO ANY HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN OR EMERGENCY SERVICES. HOWEVER FROM DISTRICTS STILL HAD AN AVERAGE. SKEWS ME ANNUAL REVENUE OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN DOLLARS MOST OF WHICH CAME THROUGH AN AD VALORUM PROPERTY TAX. TUESDAY APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO CONTRA COSTA GRAND JURY FILED A REPORT RECOMMENDING THE CONTRA COSTA LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION CUP MISSION AS WE ALL KNOW IS LASKO. DOES ALL THE DISTRICTS CITING THE LACK OF DIRECT. MEDICAL SERVICES AS WELL AS VERY HIGH ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. AS NOTED THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE REVIEWED ALL OF THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS. AND TO QUOTE FROM THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THESE DISTRICTS ARE SOMETIMES ACCUSED OF BEING HIGHLY COMPENSATED MIDDLEMAN THAT INCUR UNNECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. TWENTY NINETEEN THE DISTRICT SPENT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THIS ONE POINT FOUR MILLION TOTAL REVENUE. I'M FIGHTING THE DOES A LOOK THE DISSOLUTION OF THIS DISTRICT. OVER HALF ITS BUDGET IS BEING SPENT ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THAT'S THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS COULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON HEALTH SCREENINGS SENIOR CITIZEN CARE GIVING SUPPORT HOMELESS PREVENTION OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THESE COMMUNITIES. ABSOLUTELY DESPERATELY NEED. HOWEVER THE DISTRICT IS ONLY OPEN TWELVE HOURS A WEEK.

AND MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A MODERATOR LADIES IN GENERAL COMMITTEE WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME. PLEASE CENTER DRESSEL THANK YOU I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. YES MA'AM- OBVIOUSLY ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY- FOLKS CALLING MAN- ART ARE TWO ISSUES ONE IS ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE- AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON HEALTHCARE ISSUES. OFF FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SINCE I CAME HERE FOR THE UNINSURED AND THE UNDERINSURED SO THAT CONCERNS ME IF YOU COULD. TALK A BIT ABOUT. THE CARE THAT'S ALREADY THAT CARE THAT IS BEING PROVIDED AND WHAT THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL COULD HAVE ON THAT CARE SO I'M GREATLY CONCERNED ESPECIALLY- BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS A COMMUNITY. THAT IS OF A LESS RESOURCES AND UNDERSERVED SO IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE- YOU KNOW WHAT COULD WHAT COULD THIS BILL- DUE TO THAT- CONTINUITY OF CARE OF OFF FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BEING SERVED. THANK YOU THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION SO THE CONTINUITY OF CARE IS THERE'S ALREADY SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE COUNTY. AND THEIR DUPLICITY TOOK TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE INTENDED IN THE MISSION STATEMENT OF THE DISTRICT. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THE TRANSITION IS AUTOMATIC THERE ALREADY THERE THERE IN THE OLD HOSPITAL. THEY'RE ALREADY PROVIDING IS ALSO- SENATOR OF THE CLINICAL LA RAZA IS IN PITTSBURGH ALSO PROVIDING A WONDERFUL OF. ARRAY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- THROUGH THEIR WONDERFUL NETWORK. WE ALSO HAVE VERY MANY SERVICE CLUBS THAT ARE DOING THE FREE CLASS CLASSES PROGRAMS AT ALL OF THE THINGS BUT THE COUNTY IS ALREADY AN ESTABLISHED ENTITY. IN THE AREA WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THESE RESOURCES THESE ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES AND REAPPLY ADD ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OF HEALTH CARE. OF THROUGH THIS THERE WILL BE A ADVISORY COMMITTEE PUT IN PLACE OF CITIZENS AND THE BOARD IS MORE THAN WELCOME TO APPLY FOR THAT POSITION OF AN ADVISORY. BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT A LOT MORE BEING DONE FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY. FOR AND- THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN BROUGHT UP THAT- I KNOW THAT THAT A LOT OF IT IS AT THE CORE OF THIS. IS THE ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE RESOLVED LOCALLY. OR OR BY THE STATE- AND SO I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT BACK. IF YOU COULD. GET INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE- AGAIN THERE'S A SYSTEM THERE IS A SYSTEM THERE IS A PROCESS SET UP AND WE'RE BASICALLY BEING ASKED OF THE STATE. TO CHANGE THAT SYSTEM WHILE IT'S STILL IN IN IN THAT LITIGATION PROCESS RIGHT NOW AND AS I UNDERSTAND. AND IT IS AN APPEAL PROCESS NOW. WHAT MIGHT MIGHT. ABSOLUTE HOW I'M OFFENDED IS THAT THEY'RE USING MONEY TO DEFEND THIS PROCESS THAT SHOULD GO TO THE PEOPLE. IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THIS IS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE SPENT WHERE WE LOOK AT POST PANDEMIC WE NEED MENTAL BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH HELP WE NEED ALL OF THESE THINGS TO BE ABLE TO MULTIPLY OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN THIS DISTRICT. AND AS THIS PLAYS OUT AND TIME AND TIME AND TIME THAT'S LESS AND LESS MONEY THAT ARE GOING TO THE INTENDED RECIPIENTS FOR HEALTHCARE. AND THAT'S MY WHOLE PURPOSE IS JUST TO MAKE SURE AT THE ALL OF THESE ENTITIES FOR GRAND JURIES. A REPORTS THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS UNANIMOUSLY LASKO UNANIMOUSLY AND THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION ALL RECOMMENDING THAT. THERE'S ALREADY ENERGY THERE TO PROVIDE THIS AND WE CAN MULTIPLY THE EFFECTIVENESS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND JUST QUIT SPENDING LEGAL FEES. TO DEFEND SOMETHING THAT REALLY ULTIMATELY WE CAN YOU APPROACH AND A BUSINESS APPROACH WE CAN GET MORE VALUE FOR A BIGGER BANG. FOR OUR BUCK FOR FOLKS. WELL I HAVE TO BE A I FEEL BE IN THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES- AS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND I FELT REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE SORT OF LIKE. HERE'S A LOCAL COMMUNITY AND THEN WILL BE ANNOUNCED BY THE STATE- TO CHANGE JUST TO CHANGE THE PROCESS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S STILL UNDER THE COURTS TO. I WILL- I WILL SUPPORT TODAY HOWEVER I REALLY. URGE YOU TO LOOK AT THIS LANGUAGE YEAH. I GUESS THAT WAS MENTIONED HERE ABOUT- CHANGING COURT TO COURT OF APPEALS AND- AND SEE IF IT COULD BE RESOLVED BECAUSE- AT THIS POINT AND I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE FOR THE WEEDS OF IT YEAH YEAH BUT IT FEELS VERY MUCH LIKE THE- WE'RE- BEING PITTED AGAINST A LOCAL COMMUNITY. I AT THE STATE LEVEL SO. THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I STAND TODAY AND I REALLY URGE YOU TO. GET DEEPER INTO THE PROPOSED CHANGES THANK YOU AND CENTER I AM A FORMER. RESIDENT OF THE CITY OF PITTSBURGH WHEN I FIRST GOT MARRIED I MOVED TO PITTSBURGH AND LIVE THERE SO I KNOW THE COMMUNITY WHILE. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER DRIVE SO WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEN AND WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE DISPOSITION OF THE DISTRICT HAS BEEN A LONG TERM QUESTION FOR CONTRA COSTA COUNTY THIS BILL IS AN EQUITABLE SOLUTION TO THE HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE REGION SO THE COUNTY IS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE DISSOLUTION OF THE DISTRICT WILL REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS HAVE TO BE PUT BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY AND MAKE ADDITIONAL FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR HEALTH PROGRAMS I RESPECTFULLY ASTRONAUT THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER AND- AS WELL AS IMMIGRATION OUR RIGHTS WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR- BY- SAID SENATOR DORADO.

FOR YOUR GUN. YEAH OKAY. WE'VE GOT. A I WOULD JUST TO A DOCTOR FRAZIER BUT GO HAVE A. FOR PROSECUTION OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL AND CONSUMER ELEMENTS IN OUR IN OUR COUNTIES ARE SHERIFF'S OF COURSE- PATROL UNINCORPORATED AREAS- ADMINISTER COUNTY ORDERS AS WELL AS OVERSEE OUR COUNTY JAILS ON A LARGE IMPACT ON THE PEOPLE OF OUR GREAT STATE. HOWEVER WHEN THEY ARE SELECTED OR ELECTED IT'S USUALLY WHEN WE HAVE THE FEWEST AMOUNT OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATING AND FRANKLY THE LEAST DIVERSE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN THE ELECTORATE SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE NOTIONS ACROSS OUR OUR STATE AND NATION- ENGAGEMENT RACIAL RECONCILIATION MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE OF HISTORICALLY WITHOUT A VOICE HAVE A VOICE IN THESE. IN THESE IMPORTANT ELECTIONS HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND ACROSS THE STATE WE'VE SEEN STARK DIFFERENCES IN VOTER TURNOUT BETWEEN THE GUBERNATORIAL AND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. AND THIS WITH THAT ENABLE US TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION ON THESE ON THESE KEY MATH ON THESE KEY POSITIONS WITH IT WITHIN OUR COUNTIES I WE DID AMEND THE BILL RECENT ELECTIONS TO FOCUS TO TAKE OUT THE ASSESSORS TO DEAL. STRICTLY WITH THE- PUBLIC SAFETY POSITIONS OF A DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND SHERIFF. AND I KNOW THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL QUESTIONS AND ISSUES ALL THROUGH ENGAGE AT DURING THE Q. AND A PIECE OF THE WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH OUR PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAVE- ONE SPEAKER I BELIEVE- ON THE PHONE LEGAL ADVISORS AS WELL AS ONE WITNESS. I WITH US TODAY A LOCAL GROUP HERE IN SACRAMENTO ORGANIZED SACRAMENTO. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR YOU HAVE A ANDREW MUSE FISHER HAS THAT CORRECT. YOU HAVE AN ANYBODY PAPER IN THE ROOM. OKAY YEAH PLEASE CONFIRM. FROM WHERE THEY COME. JUST GO DOWN A FIGHT YOURSELF AND THEN YOU CAN PROCEED WITH YOUR AT TWO MINUTES ALL RIGHT MY NAME IS MICHELLE PATTERSON TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF ORGANIZED SACRAMENTO AS A SPONSOR OF EIGHTY SEVEN FIFTY NINE. THIS BILL PROMOTES GREATER VOTER PARTICIPATION BY MOVING THE ELECTION OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND SHERIFF TO THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CYCLE. RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT THERE IS A GREATER GREATER VOTING PARTICIPATION BY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CYCLES- WE'VE HEARD SOME CONCERNS AND I WANT TO ADDRESS A FEW OF THEM HERE. I YOU KNOW THE DATA IS VERY CLEAR THAT IN AGGREGATE MORE PEOPLE VOTE IN DOWN BALLOT RACES ON PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BALLOTS THAN UNDER TERM BALLOTS. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR PARTICIPATION ORGANIZED SACRAMENTO- DOES A LOT OF WORK AROUND- COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN IN IN IN PUBLIC PROCESSES LIKE. FOR EXAMPLE THE CENSUS OR OR AND VOTER EDUCATION AND WE FEEL THAT THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE VOTING IDA INSURERS RACES- THEN ARE CURRENTLY- YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS THAT. COUNTY WHITE OFFICERS. ON THE PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT WITH. MIGHT I MIGHT- THE- STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR THAT MEDIA MARKETING THAT THEY HAVE TO DO- AND OUR RESEARCH INDICATES THAT- THE PRESENT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CYCLE ARE THERE ISN'T QUITE AS MUCH COMPETITION FOR THAT MEDIA MARKETING BECAUSE CALIFORNIA SO RARELY CONTESTED- AND WHAT IT IS THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL- DELLINGER A CANDIDATES ARE PURCHASING. ADD SPACE FROM VERY LARGE- MEDIA OUTLETS. NOT COMPETING IN THE SAME WAY IN THE SMALLER MARKETS THE COUNTY WHAT OFFICERS ARE. SO THIS BILL IS ABOUT INCREASING VOTER PARTICIPATION IN CRITICAL ELECTIONS AND WE APPRECIATE THE- THE COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE STAFF AND LOOK FORWARD. TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. DO WE HAVE A SECOND PERSON HERE IN THE ROOM WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. A BLACK BEAR I'M ON THE PHONE I CAN HEAR ME PLEASE GO AHEAD THEN. YOU MISTER MUSE FRAZIER WHAT. THAT'S CORRECT GO AHEAD YEAH HI THIS IS THE END USER THANK YOU THE ENDING THE SESSION WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA THANKS FOR HAVING ME TODAY THAT'S FINE SUPPORT EASTERN. NINE AND BEFORE ELEVEN I JUST WAIT WOULD LIKE TO QUICKLY EXPRESSED HER APPRECIATION. THAT THAT THAT PRESERVES COUNTRY UP TO THE TOP OF. A LOT OF SYSTEMS. THAT THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE SEPARATE PRIMARY. AND GENERAL ELECTIONS. BUT BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRACY IS. WHEN REPRESENT ARE CHOSEN WILL NO ACTION HI CHAIN BROWN A PERSON ORDER. OUT IS WELL ESTABLISHED FACT THAT PER. ELECTION ATTRACTED. MORE VOTERS BUT TERM GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION. DOESN'T THAT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ATTRACT MORE REPRESENTATIVE. VOTERS I TO THE CENTER FOR TO. WHEN COMPARING- THE NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN CORRECT ENTIRE L. LECTION AND THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. TURNOUT OF ELIGIBLE ASIAN AMERICAN VOTERS INCREASED BY FIFTEEN PERCENT. I'M TURNOUT OF ELIGIBLE LATINO VOTERS INCREASED BY 18% A SIMILAR TREND CAN BE SEEN IN YOU VOTER TURNOUT WHICH INCREASED 21% FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THE DATA HERE IS CLEAR CANDIDATES SELECTED HIGHLIGHTED DURING MID TERM ELECTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BUY SMALLER LESS REPRESENTATIVE PROPORTION OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS COMPARED TO THOSE LIKE TO DURING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEARS. AB SEVEN FIVE NINE WILL ENCOURAGE MORE VOTERS TO PARTICIPATE IN A SPECIFIC COUNTY ELECTIONS ALLOW MORE UNDERREPRESENTED VOTERS TO PARTICIPATE MAKING CRUCIAL LOCAL DECISION. HELLO THEREFORE INCREASE THE LEGITIMACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE FALCONS- LOCAL ELECTED OFFICES. ENTER THAT A LARGER AND MORE. ABOUT ASKING VOTE FOR HIM.

WELL PROPONENTS POINT TO THE NOTION THAT MORE VOTERS ON AVERAGE MAY VOTE IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. AS A REASON TO MOVE THESE CONTESTS. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE THAT VOTERS WILL EXAMINE THEIR CHOICES MORE CAREFULLY IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR. OR FRANKLY CAST MORE VOTES IN ANY PARTICULAR. CONTEST ESPECIALLY DOWN TICKET RACES. IN FACT A LONGER ELECTION BALLOT COULD RESULT IN VOTER FATIGUE AND FEWER VOTES CAST IN THOSE DOWN TICKET RACES. TO BE SURE THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT MOVING ONLY CERTAIN ELECTIONS AS THE BILL WAS RECENTLY AMENDED. WOULD ENHANCE VOTER ENGAGEMENT IN THOSE RACES AND IN FACT THERE'S A STRONG LIKELIHOOD THAT VOTER PARTICIPATION COULD DECREASE. INSTEAD THE ONLY SURE OUTCOME THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND COST OF ATTENDING THE CURRENT ELECTION CALENDAR. ADDITIONALLY DEPENDING ON A COUNTY JACKSON THE BILL COULD RESULT IN COUNTY OFFICERS ELECTED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SERVING EITHER A TWO YEAR TERM OR SIX YEAR TERM. IN IN THOSE CASES WHERE THERE WAS A TWO YEAR TERM THOSE OFFICERS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SEEK REELECTION WOULD HAVE TO DO SO JUST TWO YEARS LATER IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IST THIS WILL REQUIRE AGAIN JOHNNY RESOURCES. AND RESULT IN CERTAIN OFFICERS NECESSARILY SPENDING MORE TIME SEEKING ELECTION- AND JUST FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE- THOUGH NOT AN ATTORNEY IS LESS THAN CLEAR. THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE EVEN ABLE TO CHANGE TERM LINKS. AFTER THOSE OFFICERS HAD BEEN ELECTED SO IN OTHER WORDS THE FOLKS WHO ARE ELECTED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IF THE BOARD OF pPROVIDED THAT THE MEASURE. TO CREATE A TWO YEAR TERM TO SWITCH THE CYCLES IF YOU WILL- BUT THEY'D BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE TERM LENGTH. OF THOSE ELECTED OFFICERS SO FOR THOSE REASONS YES THE FAMOUS RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB SEVEN FIFTY NINE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH OF SUCCESS- APPRECIATE THAT ALL RIGHT SO LAYS IN GERMAN GIVE US. THIRTY SECONDS WE'RE GONNA CHECK IN TO SEE IF WE HAVE JOHN TURNER ON THE LINE I GIVE US THIRTY SECONDS WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOU. THANK THEM ON THE LINE. I GOT THAT AND WE HAVE. THE DEAN OF THE CALIFORNIA. SISTER QUICKER AND RECORDER SO SHE SHOULDN'T ALONG WITH THE DEAN OF THE SENATE SO BEFORE WE GET STARTED- MISTER TUTOR OF PLEASE MR VICE CHAIR.

THIS IS THE MOST ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT I AM WILLING TO. THE AUTHORS BEEN CHAMPIONS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO DO. ONE CUMBERLAND CHERUBS AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY. WHERE THE BLACK LADY THE OPPOSITE. WAY THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT GREATER TURNOUT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION NORDERSTEDT FACT. THAT TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION WAS SO MANY PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR PRESIDENT. THEY DID NOT TOUCH THE REST OF THE BALLOT. THAT IS NOT A GOOD THING. ASSEMBLY OF COURSE YOU THAT THERE MORE PEOPLE ARE. AND SO. ACROSS TELL ME WHY LAW OFFICE IS. WHO'S BEEN NEGLECTED IN SOME YEARS IN SOMEWHAT BEING LEFT IN OTHER YEARS. CURRENTLY THE COST OF THIS BEST THE SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS LAW BECAUSE ADDING THE TOO LONG OFFICE TO THE GROUND BALLOT THE IS ALL COMPLEX YEAH DIFFICULT AND CAUSES FRUSTRATION BECAUSE VERY WELL. AN ADDITIONAL BALLOT CAR WHICH BECAUSE THIRTY DOLLARS A WHICH ONE REQUIRE THAT TIME TWENTY PLUS MILLION VOTERS IS BUT TO SEVEN AND EIGHT MILLION. THEREFORE I THINK THAT IT'S A TO BECOME MEMBERS. THAT ONE COME WILL DO BETTER IN THE PRESIDENT ELECTION THEN THEY WILL ILLUMINATE WILL. RECALL- THE COMPLEXION OF THE DIFFERENT OF RAISING AND SPENDING MORE THAN ELECTION WILL PUT CHALLENGER OF THE DAY AND- SO I WOULD EXPECT SOMETHING MCCARTY M. TO DO SOME ABOUT THE SHERIFF CONTRACT COUNTY. YEAH IN CERTAIN DAYS MARKETS COUNTY IT YOU KNOW OF COURSE ALSO SUPPORTS THAT THE PRIME PEOPLE STATE. I ONLY EARN A NOTEBOOK THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A TWO P.

THANK YOU SO MUCH YOUR COMMENTS FOR SERVICE YOU'RE AT PLEASE SENATOR RAWSON FOR SHORT. YEAH I AM I REMOVED THE BILL I JUST DO WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION- WHICH I THINK IS COME UP.

IN TOTAL MORE PEOPLE MAY VOTE FOR SOME BODY ON THE BALLOT BUT DOES THAT EXTEND TO ALBIA POSITIONS ON THE BALLOT AND IF ANYBODY COULD HELP ANSWER THAT I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE- BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT. JUSTIN COURAGE WHERE PEOPLE COULD VOTE FOR THE TOP. THE BALLOT AND THEN LEAVE EVERYBODY ELSE OFF. SURE YEAH I CAN ADDRESS AT THAT AND- OF THE OTHER ISSUES AS WELL AS WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION ALL AT ONCE OR JUST THIS QUESTION IF YOU WANTED TO STAND YEAH YES JUST THAT QUESTION YES SIR THERE'S MORE DROP OFF ON A PRESIDENTIAL BUT EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE DROP OFF IT'S STILL WAY MORE PEOPLE VOTING AND THAT THEN IT A GUBERNATORIAL WHICH WE ALSO HAVE DROPPED OFF.

UNFORTUNATELY THAT THEY ONLY BE TRYING AT TEN TWENTY ONE RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY ADDRESSED HOW AND WHEN THE FUNDING WILL BE PROVIDED BY RIVERSIDE COUNTY. BUT BOTH THE IMPERIAL AND RIVERSIDE LACK. RECENTLY ADDED URGENCY CLASS CUT THE FULL YEAR OFF THE TIMELINE ALASKA CAN CONDUCT THE STUDY AND WITHOUT AN EXPLICITLY DEFINED ALLOCATION PROCESS AND TIMELINE FOR DISTRIBUTION OF THAT FUNDING. IT IN ESSENCE STILL MANDATE THE STUDY WITHOUT THE FUNDING IN HAND AND SO ALTHOUGH THERE FUNDING IS APPROPRIATED REQUIRING THE LACK OF TO DO THE STUDY WITHOUT AN IMPLANT. IS STILL A PRECEDENT. SETTING MANDATE THAT IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO CALICO. GIVEN THE LIMITED BUDGET ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW WITH THE JUST. THE TIMELINE CLOCK FOR THE STUDY START WHEN ALASKANS RECEIVE THE FUNDING AND WANT TO ENSURE THE TIME FRAME IS REASONABLE. WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF.

THURMOND COLLEGE. HAVE AN REPRESENTED NINETEEN COUNTIES OVER THE YEARS I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY I REPRESENTED MORTAR GUESSING DISTRICT RCTS WE STARK CONSERVATION DISTRICTS THAN ANYBODY. AND LOWER THEIR FAR AWAY FROM ME I'M NOT UNFAMILIAR WITH IMPERIAL COUNTY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WITH WATER. AND THEIR ID'S. AND I MUST TELL YOU THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. THE. PERSON THAT THIS DESIRE SUPPORT ON THE BOARD IS NOT A VOTING MEMBER AT LEAST THAT'S SAVING GRACE. BUT PUTTING THAT PERSON INTO CLOSED SESSION HAS A HUGE PROBLEM. ENDED SEPT EIGHT STRAORDINARIO A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. AND I'M NOT I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT HISTORIC ISSUE THAT HAS KIND OF BECAUSE THIS IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF IRRIGATION DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE THAT PROVIDE ENERGY. THEY HAVE. OF GENERATORS AND- AND THEY THEY PROVIDE ENERGY. BUT TO INVOLVE OTHER PARTIES THERE'S A MUCH BETTER WAY TO DO THIS THEN IF YOU WILL PUT. THE PERSON WHO COULD BE CONSTRUED AS A SPY WITHIN THAT CLOSE SESSION. WAY BACK IN THE MID EIGHTIES TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING FAR GREATER THAN THIS. THE WHOLE SACRAMENTO RIVER. I AUTHORED LEGISLATION CREATING WHAT BECAME THE SACRAMENTO RIVER CONSERVATION FOR. THAT WAS ALSO A PATTERN FOR WHAT BECAME CALVET DEALING WITH THE DEATH. BUT IT IS ALSO SIMILAR TO WHAT IMPERIAL COUNTY IRRIGATION DISTRICT HAS DONE TO DEAL WITH GIVING OTHER INPUT. ON THESE ISSUES THAT AFFECT OTHER AREAS SUCH AS RIVERSIDE COUNTY. THE GREAT SUCCESS OF THAT LEGISLATION THAT CONTRIBUTION FORM IS STILL AROUND. AND IN FACT THE SECTOR OF RESOURCES ACTUALLY CHAIRS AND ATTEND THE MEETINGS ALL OF THE TIME. AND WHAT IS THAT ALLOWED YEARS AGO THE CONVERSATION IN THE EMPLOY OF THE VARIOUS TETRIS INCLUDING ALL OF THE AGENCIES ARE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. COMMUNICATING AND COORDINATING AND EXCHANGING INFORMATION. THAT KIND OF LEGISLATION WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA AND I WOULD SUGGEST AFTER ASSEMBLY MEMBER MASON I WOULD HELP HIM OUT WITH THE YOU KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT. THAT WOULD BE WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST AS AN ALTERNATIVE. MISTER ROGERS THANK YOU MISTER VENTURE WOULD IT BE APPROPRIATE WITH YOU- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE HAVE THE LEAD SUPPORT WITNESS. ON THE LINE IN BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM OUR TO LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESSES WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT IF WE OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THEN- MR MAYS IF YOU'D BE ALRIGHT IS. WE'LL HEAR FROM THE LEAD TO POOR WITNESS WHO GETS TWO MINUTES AND FIFTY SECONDS BASED OFF OF. WHAT I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER MISTER MARTINEZ RECEIVED JUST TWO IN EQUAL TIME- IN IN ESTIMATES IF YOU COULD IN ADDRESS A VICE CHAIRS- CONCERNS ANY ADVANCE ALL RIGHT. SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COMMITTEE WE'RE GOING TO BRING ON SCOTT WHICH SCOTT WHICH AGAIN IS REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION ELECTRICAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA ST PATRICK'S COUNSEL IN THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL FOR SHIPMENT WORKERS. MISTER WHICH DO GET EQUAL TIME YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES AND FIFTY SECONDS THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE. IN SUPPORT OF AB TEN TWENTY ONE. HELLO MISTER HERE THANK YOU IN ADDITION TO THOSE CLIENTS I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. REPRESENT THE EMPLOYEES OF THE- GEISHA DISTRICT IT'S BEEN OUR EXPERIENCE AND IDEALLY MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THAT THIS IS A CLASSIC PROBABLY THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS EXAMPLE OF. ACTIVATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION WHEN YOU HAVE A MAJORITY OF RATEPAYERS LIVING IN A COUNTY. WHERE THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO VOICE. WITH THE BOARD DID IS DETERMINING THE RATES OF THEY'RE GONNA PAY FOR ELECTRICITY. MY MEMBERS ARE INUNDATED WITH PHONE CALLS CONSTANTLY. BY RATE PAYERS IN RIVERSIDE WHO HAVE ISSUES WITH THE UTILITY SERVICE AND YET THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE NO RECOURSE BECAUSE THEY HAVE. NO ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES THAT THEY CAN APPROACH. WE FEEL THAT THE I. B. W. IN THE AND THE WORKERS THAT WE REPRESENT ID THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE GET THEIR ARMS AROUND THIS INJUSTICE IS GOING ON. IN THE KATELLA VALLEY. IN THAT- TO THE POINT OF THE VICE CHAIR WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. THERE'S MANY EXAMPLES IN STATE GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE NON VOTING MEMBERS WHO SIT. IN IN CLOSED SESSION ALL THE TIME THERE'S NONVOTING MEMBERS ON THE- ISSUE BORDER TRUSTEES ON THE UC REGENTS ON THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION. THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON PRACTICE THERE'S LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND- LIABILITIES THAT COME WITH BEING ON A BOARD IN MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY. BUT IF THERE'S OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT NEED TO BE AMENDED INTO THIS BILL SURELY WE CAN WORK THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO DO THAT BUT I WOULD JUST URGE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT. THE RATE PAYERS. WHO SIT THERE AND ARE HAVING POLICIES IN IN IN. MIKE REALLY SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR ELECTRICITY IN THE SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE WITHOUT HAVING ANY REPRESENTATION SO WE WERE JUST URGE AND I VOTE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER WHICH I MISTER WHICH BEGIN IN SUPPORT OF AB TEN TO ONE TODAY ALL RIGHT LASERJET COMMITTEE WERE IN TURN OVER SOME REMAINS SOME REMAINS IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF DANCE FOR THE VICE CHAIR THANKS AS WELL. MISTER VICE CHAIR AND SENATOR A GOOD TO SEE YOU- I DO NOT IN FACT I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU ON THIS YEAR YOU'VE HAD- NOT YEARS OF EXPERIENCE- IN IN STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAD DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN A IN STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT I AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT FOR OTHERS LIKE WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT. WELL WHAT THIS IS- IS ABOUT THIS SITUATIO OF AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS THAT WAS ADOPTED OVER NINETY WELL ABOUT NINETY YEARS AGO WHEN THINGS WERE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THEY ARE TODAY WE NOW HAVE A SITUATION IN WHICH AN IMPERIAL ARE THE OF THE PILLAR GEISHA DISTRICT THIS YEAR GEISHA DISTRICT ONE FOR PROVIDING JUST WATER DID TO PROVIDING WATER AND POWER IN THIS ELECTRICAL SERVICES AREA. THERE THE REVENUES THAT ARE GENERATED- IN THAT NOT FOR THAT- THAT DISTRICTS ARE FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF ENERGY AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN WATER IT'S ARGUABLE NOW THERE AND ENERGY COMPANY AND WATER IS SECONDARY I DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST YOU THOUGH THAT WATER IS A DECEPTIVE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IT IS IN FACT IT IS A LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE IMPERIAL COUNTY IF THEY DON'T HAVE WATER AND THEY DON'T GET THEIR ALLOCATION OF WATER THAN THEY DON'T SURVIVE- THAT THAT LANGUAGE I'M NOT MAKING THAT UP THAT'S NOT- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT EXAGGERATED IT IS REAL AND I'VE TOLD THEM OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BUT I WILL FIGHT WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SECURED THEIR WATER BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS THOUGH THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS THOUGH IS THAT 60% OF THE PEOPLE THERE IN THEIR ELECTRICAL SERVICE. AREA DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT HAVE FOR SOMEBODY. ON THEIR BORDER TO. AND WE ALL GET THAT BECAUSE WE ALL UNDERSTAND GOVERNMENT. THIS IDEA THAT THEY MIGHT BY MINORITY PART OF A GROUP GETS THAT MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS WITHOUT ANY INPUT. FROM THE MAJORITY AND YOU ARE ALSO RIGHT YOU ARE ALSO RIGHT. THAT ALL THIS BILL DOES RIGHT NOW AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN IS TO PROVIDE A DELEGATE. TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DEVOTE BUT WOULD BE ABLE TO GET SOME INFORMATION. IT'S NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE WE NEED TO GET TOWARDS PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION. BUT IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IF MISTER CHAIR IF I CAN. I JUST SAY MAYBE REFERENCE A COUPLE OF- OF THE OTHER. FOLKS THAT ACCORDING TO MISTER MARTINEZ THAT COLD. HOLDEN HE'S BEEN WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH I IN FACT. OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS- AS IT SITS TODAY HAS ALSO BEEN WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH AND I. WANT TO CONTINUE TO KEEP WORKING WITH THEM IT IS A GOVERNMENT ENTITIES A GOVERNMENT AGENCY. AND THEY SERVE THE SAME PEOPLE THAT THAT I SERVED AS A LOT MORE WORK TO DO IN THIS SPACE. THIS IS JUST ONE STEP. ALONG THE ROAD. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GRATEFUL FOR THAT I HAVE SOME VERY QUICK COMMENTS BUT BEFORE I MAKE THEM I WANNA CHECK IN WITH US IN OUR DRESSING ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THERE IS A MOTION THANK YOU SO MUCH WE DO HAVE EMOTIONAL- BY SENATOR ALSO. LOOK AT. I UNDERSTAND HOW CHALLENGING IN. HISTORIES ALONG WITH THIS ISSUE- AND I KNOW I'M NOT A NEWCOMER IN- TO THIS ISSUE- BUT- I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN IN WHICH AS A MEMBER MAYES IS BRINGING FORWARD. JUST BEING CANDID- IF THIS WAS AN AREA THAT I REPRESENT. AND 60% OF THE BUSINESS. IS IN AN AREA WHERE THERE IS NO VOICE TO CONSTITUENTS I MEAN THAT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE RIGHT. I MEAN TRULY IF- I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DISTRICT IS WORKING ON THAT AND VERY GRATEFUL- BUT THIS IS BEEN A LONG STANDING CHALLENGE THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. SO WHETHER THAT IS ULTIMATELY HOME RULE. WHERE DOES IN RIVERSIDE CONTROL THEIR OWN DESTINY WHEN IT COMES TO POWER THERE'S SOME TYPE OF SHARED- POWER IN GOVERNANCE AT BETWEEN RIVERSIDE IN IMPERIAL COUNTY WHATEVER THAT MODEL MAY BE- IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE GET THERE AND WE GET THERE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. AND ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT RIVERSIDE YOU SEEN INCREDIBLE GROWTH AT WHICH IS WHY WE SEEN A SHIFT IN OUT WHERE THE POWER LOAD HENCE THE CONSTITUENTS ARE LOCATED. BUT THERE THERE ARE VERY FEW AREAS IN THE STATE. WHERE THERE IS SUCH A GAP WHEN IT COMES TO REPRESENTATION JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT IT. NOT TRYING TO THROW STONES BUT SIMPLY SAYING WE HAVE TO FIX IT- AND KNOW THAT THE DISTRICT IS WORKING ON IT- AND AS A MEMBER MAYES HAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR IT. SO I KNOW THAT THIS IS- I'LL SAY THERE'S A LOT MORE TO COME. A LOT MORE CONVERSATION AND HOPEFULLY A LONG TERM SOLUTION WE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'LL TURN IT OVER TO YOU FOR A CLOSE. BY ALMOST ONE- THAT MAKE THAT MY CLOTHES BECAUSE I THINK YOU YOU HAD A VERY WELL MISTER CHAIR THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD SUGGEST- IS TO- MRS MILLER WHO I'VE WORKED WITH A LOT IN THE PAST.

OUR OFFICE MANAGES THE COUNTY'S ASSESSMENT DEALS PROGRAM AND I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE THREE. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT BILL AB TOTAL THREE WOULD PROVIDE CRUCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE BOARD'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE. TO APPOINT BOARD MEMBERS TO HEAR TAXPAYER APPEALS. UNDER EXISTING LAW THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO RECRUITING CANDIDATES TO SERVE ON THE ASSESSMENT BILLS FOR. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO IDENTIFY AND EXPAND THE POOL OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES TO SERVE IN OUR APPEALS PROGRAM. AB TWELVE THREE WILL HELP BROADEN THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO RECRUIT. PEOPLE THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR WHO EVALUABLE EXPERIENCES THAT WE CANNOT REACH UNDER EXISTING LAW. BY ALLOWING A PERSON WITH A MINIMUM OF FIVE YEARS PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BUSINESS ACCOUNTING. AND TAXATION LAND USE AND URBAN PLANNING REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT OR INVESTMENT ANALYSIS AND IN REAL ESTATE BANKING OR FINANCING WILL BROADEN THE POOL OF CANDIDATES TO INCLUDE PEOPLE WITH PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. RELATED TO PROPERTY APPRAISALS AND NOT JUST LIMITED TO PEOPLE WITH PROFESSIONAL DEGREES ARE LICENSES FOR EXAMPLE WE MIGHT FIND SOMEONE WITH TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN EVALUATING APPRAISALS FOR BANKS. OR ANALYZING REAL ESTATE SALES DATA AND TRENDS FOR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY BUT WITHOUT A REAL ESTATE BROKERS LICENSE LAW DEGREE OR PRISON LICENSE. THAT PERSON IS UNAVAILABLE FOR US TO EVEN CONSIDER FOR POSITION ON THE ASSESSMENT FIELD SPORT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS BY FAR THE MOST APPEAL APPLICATIONS FILED IN THE STATE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE RECEIVED NEARLY AS MANY APPLICATIONS AS THE NEXT FIVE LARGEST COUNTIES COMBINED. CONSEQUENTLY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO CREATE MANY MORE APPEALS COURTS TO COUNTER THESE HEARINGS. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF AB THIRTY THREE SEVENTY THREE LAST YEAR. OUR COUNTY HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF PORTS FROM FIVE TO SIX WE ANTICIPATE EXPANDING UP TO TEMPLE WHAT BY NEXT YEAR. THUS DOUBLING OUR CAPACITY TO STAFF SCHEDULE IN HERE THE MORE THAN THIRTY SIX THOUSAND APPEALS. APPLICATION ARE CURRENTLY IN OUR SYSTEM. AS WELL AS THOUSAND OF ANTI.

ON BEHALF OF THE MEMBERS OF KEITA AND HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION AND- CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION ALMOST. RESPECTFULLY CONTINUE TO OPPOSE TWELVE OH THREE. BY REDUCING THE COOLING OFF PERIOD FOR FORMER ASSESSOR PERSONNEL. SEEKING TO SERVE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY APPEALS BOARD ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD FROM THREE YEARS TO ONE. AB TWELVE THREE WE BELIEVE INVITES BIAS FROM THE ASSESSMENT APPEALS PROCESS AND UNDERMINES THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM. HE ALWAYS PROPERTY TAX RULES THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE THREE E. THREE TWENTY FOUR AM THREE ZERO TO SEE FIRST UPON INDICATES THAT IN DECIDING AN APPEALS CASE ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD MEMBERS MUST RELY EXCLUSIVELY. ON EVIDENCE PRESENTED DURING THE HEARING AND NOT RELY UPON OUTSIDE KNOWLEDGE. REDUCING THE COOLING OFF PERIOD ALLOWS FORMER ASSESSOR PERSONNEL TO DECIDE CASES RELATING TO MORE RECENT ASSESSMENTS OF WHICH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED OR LIKELY HAVING A INTERMITTENTLY FILM FAMILIAR IN THE PROCESS THE PLAYERS. AND THE PROPERTY. THIS IS PATENTLY UNFAIR AND VIOLATES THE PROPERTY TAX RULES. IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS THESE ARE CONCERNS WE MET SEVERAL TIMES WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE WITH A STAFF OF THE ASAP ASSEMBLY REVENUE TAX COMMITTEE. AS WELL AS LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE PROPOSE SEVERAL ROUNDS OF POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS DESIGNED TO ALLEVIATE OUR CONCERNS. DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS THESE DISCUSSIONS WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL.
