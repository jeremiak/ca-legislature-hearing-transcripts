TODAY IS TUESDAY JULY. TO NINE TWENTY NINETEEN THIS WILL HELP QUORUM WAS PROCEED AS A SUB COMMITTEE I SEE SENATOR ALLEN AND JOINING US -- WELCOME SENATOR ALLEN YOU HAVE -- ITEM SB. SIX SIX FOUR ANYTIME YOU'RE READY. YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF US SIX SIXTY FOUR WHICH WHICH OFFERS A CALPERS REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES HAVE CLEAR AUTHORITY TO RESPONSIBLE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION. FOR NECESSARY DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES TO OPERATE TOOLS AND REGIONAL TRANSIT SYSTEMS ON THE PUBLIC'S BEHALF. I WANT THE TO COMMITTEE I THANK THE CHAIR -- THE EXCELLENT STAFF FOR THE PHONE CALLS THE EMAILS THE MARATHON STAKEHOLDER MEETING. THAT PREDATES -- MY PRESENTATION THE BILL HERE TODAY -- AND I ALSO WANT TO THINK ON OPPOSITION AND SUPPORTERS A MINUTE WE WE'VE I THINK AT A VERY PROGRESS PRODUCTIVE. CONVERSATION -- WE HAVE -- AN EXTENSIVE ARRAY OF AMENDMENTS LAID OUT BETWEEN PAGES. ELEVEN EIGHTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS AND I'M ACCEPTING ALL OF THEM. HI VA WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY NARROW SB SIX SIXTY FOUR NUMBER SIGNIFICANT WAYS AND I I WILL SAY I THINK APPROPRIATELY SO -- EVEN THOUGH SOME AYE SUPPORTERS MEN AND GREAT -- YOU KNOW AS THE COMMITTEE KNOWS CALIFORNIA AUTHORIZES REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES TO BUILD OPERATE AND MAINTAIN ROADS BRIDGES AND TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND PROVIDE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC I AM BEFORE YOU WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE A GROWING LIST. OF LITIGANTS SOME PETITIONING FOR CLASS ACTION STATUS OF FILED CLAIMS AGAINST MANY REGIONAL TOLL AGENCIES AND CONTRACTORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ALLEGING VIOLATIONS IMPERIL. LILY BILLIONS IN TAXPAYER TALKS FOR DOLLARS -- PLEASE ARGUING THERE BEEN MILLIONS OF VIOLATIONS. OF STREETS AND HIGHWAYS CODE SECTION THIRTY ONE FOR NINETY WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED. IN TWENTY TEN THROUGH LEGISLATION AUTHORED BY CENTER JUST MEDIAN WHICH IS SB. TWELVE SIXTY EIGHT NOW THE WELL DOCUMENTED INTENT OF CENTERS MILLIONS BILL AND I THINK I HAVE HIS FACT SHEET. FROM DEEP IN THE HISTORY OF TWENTY TEN HERE IN THE WELL BUT FOR THE WELL DOCUMENTED INTENT WAS TO CODIFY UNIFORM STANDARDS. ACROSS ALL CALIFORNIANS TOLLING AGENCIES TO PROTECT AGAINST PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION CONSUMERS. BEING PROVIDED TO COMPANIES ORGANISATIONS FOR MARKETING OR INAPPROPRIATE USES. A CENTER SEAT MEDIAN FACT SHEET ACTUALLY DETAILS HOW THE BILL WAS CRAFTED EXPLICITLY SO THAT. IT WOULD NOT HINDER A TRANSPORTATION AGENCY FROM FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES REQUIRED TO OPERATE AND MANAGE TOLL FACILITIES. INCLUDING THE SHARING OF DATA TO ENSURE INTER OPERABILITY OF TOLL COLLECTION DEVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES. IN THE MIDST OF ONGOING LITIGATION A CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF SB SIX SIXTY FOUR WOULD APPLY RETROACTIVELY. AND THE SECTIONS DESERVE I THINK VERY CAREFUL SCRUTINY -- BY ALL OF THE ALL OF US TO ENSURE THAT OUR INTENT IN GRANTING RETROACTIVITY. IS TRULY IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. A SERIES CONSUMER INJURIES CAN AND DO OCCUR WHEN SENSITIVE AND PRIVATE INFORMATION IS SHARED FOR MARKETING OR INAPPROPRIATE SERVICES -- BUT YOU KNOW THE OTHER DAY. THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL AND AND THE VERY NARROW LANGUAGE THE BILL ESPECIALLY NOW WITH THESE WITH THESE I THINK VERY WELCOME A MAN'S. I MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL DOES NOT LOOSEN PROTECTIONS WHICH GUARD AGAINST THE MISUSE OF DATA IT PRESERVES EXISTING PROHIBITIONS ON SALE OR DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION UNCONNECTED. WITH OPERATING TOLL FACILITIES IN TRANSIT PAYMENT SYSTEMS. BUT THE LEGISLATION ALSO RESPONSIBLY DEFENDS THE VITAL PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF A COMPREHENSIVE. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DOES INCLUDE. ARE YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE PAY. ARE THERE TOLLS. ABSENT CLEAR EVIDENCE THE CALIFORNIANS ARE BETTER OFF IF BILLIONS OF TAX DOLLARS ARE IMPERILED. THIS BILL PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT NECESSARY CLARIFICATION OF STATE LAW TO INCLUDE. I STARTED TO CONTINUE ALLOWING TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES TO USE PERSONAL DATA EFFICIENTLY FOR THINGS LIKE. YEP PASS IT ON THE ADDRESS SO AS TO BE ABLE -- TO SEND A NOTICE OF TOLL -- WHILE AT THE SAME TEAM MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE PROHIBITIONS AGAINST IMPROPER SHARING OF THAT INFORMATION. I I I REALLY DO REITERATE THE HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE ON THIS -- I EVEN WHEN I FIRST TOOK THE BILL AND I HI AND AND I I SAW HOW THINGS WERE LINING UP I MYSELF WAS. REALLY CONCERNED LOOKING FOR TO THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE TO TO ENSURE. THAT WE REALLY KEPT THIS NARROWLY FOCUSED. ON ON ON ALLOWING THE AGENCIES TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THAT'S COOL THAT THEY'RE CLEAR ALLOWED TO DO. WE SEND THE INTENT OF THE CIVILIAN BILL WHILE NOT ALLOWING ANY MORE ANY ANY ADDITIONAL -- YOU KNOW ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT. AND I THINK THAT WE'VE GOTTEN THERE WITH THESE MEN CERTAINLY HAPPY TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS -- AS THIS BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD I WITH ME I HAVE SEVERAL JOHNSON IS THE CHIEF TOLL OPERATIONS OFFICER FOR THE TRANSPORTATION QUARTER AUTHORITIES. OF ORANGE COUNTY IS ALSO CHAIR THE TRICK CALIFORNIA TOLL OPERATORS COMMITTEE AND ALSO MORE TOP WAS HERE ON BEHALF OF AN ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY I I KNOW ALSO WE'VE GOT -- TO HELP WITH LEGAL AND TECHNICAL QUESTIONS BEEN RUBIN. WHO IS WITH THE TRANSMISSION COURT OR IT THOR IT AGENCIES OF ORANGE COUNTY? THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR SOME IN THIS PLACE. WHICH JOHNNY MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB. SIX SIXTY FOUR AS CENTER ALLEN NOTED MY NAME IS SAMUEL JOHNSON. CHIEF TOLD OPERATIONS OFFICER FOR THE TRANSPORTATION CORPS AGENCIES IN ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA. I AM THE INCOMING CHAIR OF THE INTERNATIONAL BRIDGE TUNNEL AND TURNPIKE ASSOCIATION SERVING TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MEMBERS ACROSS TWENTY THREE COUNTRIES. I ALSO SERVE AS THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA TOLD OPERATORS COMMITTEE OR C. TOPPED. SEATAC IS THAT. COALITION OF THE FOURTEEN PUBLIC AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR TOLLING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- IN ACCORDANCE WITH CALIFORNIA LAW THE MEMBERS OF SEE TOP WORK CLOSELY WITH CALTRANS IN DEVELOPING OUR SPECIFICATIONS ON HOW TO EXCHANGE DATA. TO ENSURE THAT WE ACHIEVED IN OUR ABILITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND TO MAKE SURE CUSTOMERS WERE PROPERLY BUILD IN CHARGE FOR THE USE OF TOLL FACILITIES. I WAS ARE MYSELF ALONG WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF SEE TIME WERE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN WORKING WITH SENATORS MEDIA IT'S OFFICE IN CRAFTING THE LANGUAGE AND SB. TWELVE SIXTY EIGHT TO ENSURE THE PROPER HANDLING OF PERSONAL DATA AND THAT THE TOLL I AGENCIES COULD OPERATE AS THEY DO DAILY. SEE TALK ALSO WORKS WITH THE DMV UTILIZING THEIR STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFYING VEHICLE OWNERS AND ENFORCING THE PAYMENT OF TOLLS. TOLD AGENCIES HAVE IT HERE TO THE LAW AND ITS INTENT HAS EXPRESSED BY SENATORS MEDIAN AND THERE BEEN NO BREACHES OF PRIVACY SALES OF CUSTOMER DATA. OR NO CONSUMER HARM FROM THE AGENCIES TOWING OPERATIONS HAVE OCCURRED. HOWEVER CLARIFICATIONS IN THE LAW ARE NEEDED TO COMBAT FALSE ASSERTIONS AROUND MISCONCEIVED GRAY AREAS. THESE ASSERTIONS CALL INTO QUESTION OUR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS -- AND OUR DAILY PRACTICES OF OUR AGENCIES AND THREATEN OUR MEMBERS WITH HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND FINES FOR DOING SUCH THINGS AS COMMUNICATING WITH THE DMV TO GET THE REGISTERED -- THE RICH SHOULD OWNERS ADDRESS AND INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN PROBABLY NOTICED THEM REGARDING AN UNPAID TOLL. COMPLYING WITH THE STATE MANDATE FOR INTER OPERABILITY BY SHARING INFORMATION BETWEEN TOLL AGENCIES TO PROPERLY BILL CUSTOMERS. FOR USING THE US POSTAL SERVICE FOR MAILING NOTICES TO CUSTOMERS. FOR USING VENDORS TO SUPPORT OUR SYSTEMS AND PROCESS TOLLS. AND AND AS A TRUE DICHOTOMY -- PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS ARE CLAIMING WE VIOLATE THE LAW WHEN WE CONDUCT THE SKIP TRACE TO TRYING TO GET A CORRECT ADDRESS FOR SOMEONE. BUT YET THEY ALSO CLAIM WE VIOLATE THE LAW WHEN WE DON'T DO A SKIP TRACE TO TRY AND IDENTIFY THE CORRECT ADDRESS. OF SOMEONE WHO HASN'T PAID THEIR TOLL. SO SB SIX SIXTY FOUR WOULD CLEAR UP THESE GRAY AREAS AND CODIFIED ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE LAW. WHILE RETAINING PROTECTIONS FOR PRIVACY. ALLOWING US TO PERFORM OUR DAILY FUNCTIONS THAT ARE BEST PRACTICES IN THE TOLLING A TREE. THIS BILL SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF TOLLING AS A VIABLE REVENUE SOURCE USED TO ENHANCE MOBILITY. MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM AND IMPROVE TRANSIT OPERATIONS AS WELL AS SUPPORT CRITICAL SAFETY FUNCTIONS PERFORMED BY THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. IN CLOSING WE APPRECIATE THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR -- FOR ALL THEIR EFFORTS CAN CRAFTING REASONABLE AMENDMENTS HOW WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK PRODUCTIVELY TO ADDRESS OPPOSITION CONCERNS WE SCALE BACK THE RETROACTIVITY VERBIAGE.

WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB. SIX SIX FOUR AS NOTED SB SIX SIX FOR THE CLARIFICATION BILL -- THAT WE BELIEVE IS A CRITICAL TO PRESERVE THE ABILITY FOR TOLL OPERATORS ACROSS THE STATE TO MEET IN OUR OPERABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND FORCE TOLL POLICIES. INITIAL VIOLATIONS IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. ALL WITHOUT WEAKENING EXISTING PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR THE USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. SB SIX SIX FOUR WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT TOLL OPERATORS SUCH AS THEIR CTA CAN CONTINUE TO EQUITABLY ENFORCED TOLL POLICIES INCLUDING WHEN RENTAL WHEN USING THE USE WHEN USING -- RENTAL CARS ARE USING THE FACILITIES OR WHEN A DRIVERS USING A TRANSPONDER TRANSPONDER PROVIDED BY A TOLL OPERATOR IN ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE WHICH ARE BOTH REQUIREMENTS OF STATE LAW OFF UPON US. WITHOUT THESE CLARIFICATIONS TOLL FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE. I WILL BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION CHALLENGES THAT COULD DISRUPT THE VIABILITY OF EXISTING AND FUTURE TOLL FACILITIES. AND THREATEN THE ABILITY OF TOLL AGENCIES TO USE EXCESS TOLL REVENUES TO INVEST IN ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS AND TRANSIT SUBSIDIES. IT'S A CHAIRMAN WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE -- THE TIME YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAS SPENT WORKING ON THIS BILL -- AS NOTED THE AMENDMENTS IDENTIFIED IN THE MOCK UP IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NARROW THE BILL WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THEM BEING VERY SURGICAL AMENDMENTS THAT HEN WE WE THINK THAT THAT THEY HOUND THE BILL TO THE CRITICAL AND MOST IMPORTANT PIECES. OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS THE PASSAGE OF SB SIX SIX FOUR WILL MAINTAIN EXISTING CONSUMER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT TOLL OPERATORS CAN SHARE NECESSARY INFORMATION WITH EACH OTHER TO COMPLY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL IN OUR OPERABILITY REQUIREMENTS. IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE. AND FACIL AND FAT AND FACILITY EFFICIENCY. AND MAXIMIZE THE USE OF REVENUES FOR REINVESTMENT AND FURTHER TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS WE ASK YOUR AYE ABOUT.

AND THE IMPLEMENTATION -- PROGRAM IS LINKED TOWARDS THE TRANSIT PASSES THAT WOULD PROVIDE. AND SO IT MAKES IT ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO KIND OF GET A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM -- RIGHT ALSO ADD THAT -- EXCESS TOLL REVENUE AND THE TO PARTS OF THE FREEWAY SYSTEM IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT WE OPERATE THE TOLL LANES.

MR MEMBERS GREG HAYES ON BEHALF OF NAY ELEGY HEADQUARTERED IN SAN DIEGO THE LEADING TELLING TECHNOLOGY PROVIDER IN THE COUNTRY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS -- OPPOSITION TO THE BILL POLICE ARE STILL FOR WELCOME ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS BACK AYE KRAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITTEE ON THE AUTHOR'S WORKS TO ADDRESS A FEW OF OUR CONCERNS HOWEVER WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BELL -- AS WILL BE AMENDED IN THIS COMMITTEE -- I'M A PUT ASIDE THE QUESTIONS AROUND -- WHETHER OF THE LIABILITY AND RETROACTIVITY ISSUES -- BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE ADDRESSING AS AN I'M GONNA FOCUS MY TESTIMONY SOLELY ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER. THE POLICY CHANGES CONTEMPLATED AND THE SPELL ARE GOOD POLICY GOING FORWARD AND THE CLEAR ANSWER IS NO THEY ROLL BACK PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND REYES SIRIUS DUE PROCESS CONCERNS. LOOKING JUST AT THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN SECTION ONE OF THE BILL UNDER SUBDIVISION I THE SUBDIVISION -- THAT CHANGES WOULD EXPAND THE PERMISSIBLE -- REASONS FOR SHARING DATA FROM FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS REQUIRED TO OPERATE AND MANAGE THE TOLL COMPANIES TO ANY OPERATING AND MANAGEMENT PURPOSE WHICH LEAVES OPEN THE ABILITY. TO UNDER THIS BILL PERMISSIBLE YOU SHARE ALL OF THIS INFORMATION WITH EVERYONE FROM JANITORS TO BIG DATA AS LONG AS THOSE AGENT THOSE ENTITIES. RELATE IN SOME WAY TO THE OPERATING OR MANAGEMENT OF THE TOLL COLLECTION AGENCY WHETHER OR NOT IT'S REAL THERE IF THEY HAVE ANY LEGITIMATE NEED FOR THIS DATA. MOVING ON TO SUBDIVISION J. -- THE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD QUALIFY THE WRITTEN CONSENT REQUIRED PRIOR TO SENDING MARKETING MATERIALS IT UNDER THIS BILL IT WOULD BE QUALIFIED SO THAT YOU WOULD ONLY NEED THIS WRITTEN CONSENT. FOR INFORMATION ACQUIRED ON OR BEFORE JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN MEANING THAT IF A TOLL AGENCY HAS SOMEONE SCHEME OUT FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY ACQUIRED ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND TEN THEY CAN EMAIL MARKETING MATERIALS WITHOUT ANY WRITTEN CONSENT. TO THAT PERSON UNDER THIS BELL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IN THE AMENDMENTS. MOVING ON LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE SECTION OF SECTION ONE IT'S ALL ABOUT WHEN AND WHY TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES CAN SHARE PRIVATELY IDENTIFIED. IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH ANOTHER ENTITY AND SO THE CHANGES IN SUBDIVISION AL TO THE DEFINITION OF TRANSPORTATION AGENCY TO INCLUDE ANY CONTRACTOR. ISN'T A HUGE LOOPHOLE. BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW A TOLL COLLECTION AGENCY TO GET AROUND ALL OF THE REASONABLE DATA SHARING RESTRICTIONS IN THIS SECTION. ON COMPLETELY UNDERMINES THE ENTIRE INTENT OF THE STATUTE. FOR THESE REASONS WE THINK THAT THE SPELL THE POLICY MOVING FORWARD -- IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE CONCERNS AROUND THE ODD. RETROACTIVITY AND THE DUE PROCESS AND PUBLICATIONS WE THINK THIS IS BAD POLICY FOR CALIFORNIA DRIVERS AND WE ENCOURAGE YOUR NOTE OF IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH NEXT WHEN HIS PLACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE MEMBERS MY NAME'S BLAKE WHEN THE MEN I REPRESENT A CERTIFIED CLASS OF DRIVERS IN CALIFORNIA -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENTS GO -- TO SOME OF THE ISSUES HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL SEVERAL ISSUES WITH THIS BILL ARE HARMFUL. FIRST AND FOREMOST A SUBSECTION T. WHICH DEALS WITH THE FACT THAT THIS WOULD BE DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW. THE AMENDMENTS TO THAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST DISCUSS GO FAR AND BEYOND A WATER DECLARE TOWARD EXISTING LAW AND AND HAVE THE REAL ABILITY TO IMPERIL THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS. SECOND -- I BROUGHT THIS CASE -- OF THE FIRST ATTORNEY TO BRING A CASE OR THIRTY ONE FOR NINETY BECAUSE I'D AN EIGHTY SIX YEAR OLD HOMELESS VETERAN CLIENT. WHO HAD NO REDRESS HIS PERSONAL AND IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WAS TRANSMITTED TO THE DMV IMPROPERLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPOSING A WHOLE? UNDER THIS STATUTE SEVERAL CALIFORNIANS ARE IN JEOPARDY BECAUSE THEIR CARS CAN BE TAKEN BY THE USE OF THEIR P. I UNDER THE AMENDMENTS -- MISTER CHAIR I RESPECTFULLY LOOK AT SECTION I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THAT PROVISION AND LEADS A LARGE LOOPHOLE THAT ANY OPERATION OR MANAGEMENT. CAN INCLUDE SENDING P. I. FOR ANY PURPOSE. SO WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT I IN MAKE SURE THAT'S ADDRESSED REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT TI AND MAKE SURE THAT IT IS ADDRESSED -- SECOND A TO ADDRESS SECTION FOUR OH TWO FIVE FOUR OF THE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE. THE REAL CONCERN HERE IS THAT -- THEY THE TOLL ENTITIES WANT TO SEND INFORMATION TO A RELIABLE PARTY. BUT THAT BEGS THE QUESTION AS TO WHO THAT PARTY WILL BE AND WHAT THE DATA WILL BE USED FOR SENATORS TO MILLIONS BILL I HAVE THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY WAS NOT JUST ABOUT MARKETING. IT WAS ABOUT THE USE OF TRAVEL PATTERN DATA IN HERE THERE'S A REAL CONCERN THAT DRIVERS INFORMATION IS BEING -- IMPROPER CREDIT IN CORY'S -- THROUGH LEXIS NEXIS EXPERIAN OTHER COMPANIES AND THIS EXISTING LEGISLATION WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR FORWARD LOOKING CONSUMERS. TO ADDRESS THE MIS USE OF THEIR PI WITH THAT WE REQUEST ON BEHALF OF TAXPAYERS IN THE CLASS THAT THE VOTE NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE -- RICHARD HALL OVER WITH THE CONSUMER FEDERATION CALIFORNIA FIRST I DO WANT TO THANK. US UNDER ALAN AND AND THE COMMITTEE FOR A LOT OF GREAT WORK YOU'VE DONE NARROWING THE SCOPE OF THE BILL ADDRESSING MANY OF OUR CONCERNS I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. WE DO STILL CONTINUE HAVE CONCERNS AND THAT'S WHY WE TO OPPOSE THE BILL. OF AS ADDRESSED EARLIER. THERE ARE CHANGES TO CURRENT LAW THAT ARE STATED TO BE DECLARATORY OF CARTON LAW THAT WILL IMPACT PENDING LITIGATION AND AS A PUT GENERAL POLICY MATTER I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT SHOULD NOT BE APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE -- THEY INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE -- AND WE WORK WITH SENATORS MERION AND AND TWENTY TEN WE WORKED WITH THE OPPOSITION IN TWENTY TEN TO ELIMINATE ALL THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WHICH HAD TO DO AROUND RETENTION OF DATA. OF THE LENGTH OF TIME FOR RETENTION BUT AS AS CURRENTLY AMENDED ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WAS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE AGENCY TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. BEFORE JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY ELEVEN IS NOT PROTECTED BY THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF OF THE CONSUMER TO USE OR SHARE THAT SO. THAT WILL CERTAINLY IMPACT OF CURRENT LITIGATION IN A VERY NEGATIVE WAY. AND WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED WITH IRTY ONE FOR NINETY THAT ELIMINATES RESTRICTION ON OF THE SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES BECAUSE IT DEFINES. WHICH ARE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND ANY CONTRACTOR FOR ANY SUBCONTRACTOR AT ANY LEVEL AS CONSTITUTING THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY THEREFORE. THERE IS NO SHARING WHETHER IT'S WITH THE JANITORIAL FIRM OR OF CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY OR BIG DATA OR ANYONE ELSE THEY ARE NOW ALL CONSIDERED TO BE A TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL WHICH MEANS THEY'RE NOT SHARING. SO THAT IS A MAJOR CHANGE IN IN TERMS OF CURRENT CONSUMER PRIVACY PROTECTION. AND OF THE THIRD POINT HAS TO DO WITH. US SECTION. THIRTY FOUR ONE FOUR NINETY C.. VIOLATION INFORMATION IS ALREADY COVERED. OF IN CURRENT LAW OF IT CAN BE RETAINED UNTIL EITHER FOR YEARS AND SIX MONTHS HAVE HAVE PASSED WORD TOLD THE VIOLATION HAS BEEN RESOLVED BUT THIS MOVES IT TO A DIFFERENT SECTION. SO VIOLATION INFORMATION NOW CAN BE RETAINED INDEFINITELY AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT IS PROTECTIVE OF THE PRIVACY OF CONSUMERS SO. THOSE ARE OUR OUR MOST ARE EVIDENT CONCERNS BUT WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED WITH THE METHODS THAT ARE DESCRIBED FOR OBTAINING. AN ACCURATE ADDRESS BY ALLOWING ANY SOURCE TO BECOME. A RELIABLE SOURCE THAT COULD BE AN INTERNET SEARCH YOU GET AN ADDRESS YOU SEND A NOTICE TO THAT ADDRESS AND IN EFFECT THE AGENCY HAS DONE ITS JOB WE DON'T THINK THAT IS A SUFFICIENT BURDEN. ON AN AGENCY TO TRACK DOWN THE ACTUAL ADDRESS OF A OF A CONSUMER BEFORE VERY HARSH. PUNITIVE. ACTIONS ARE TAKING INCLUDING A POUNDING THEIR VEHICLE PUTTING LIENS ON THEIR VEHICLE OVER REVOKING THEIR LICENSE. SERVED WITH WITH -- WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPROVEMENTS WE STILL ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ADDITION OPPOSITION PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION PLACE. TO BE AN ATTACK OR THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA WE ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS ALREADY MADE GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT LOOPHOLES THAT ARE STILL IN THE BUILDER AND OPPOSE MONTH AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH NEXT PLEASE. ROSE MERRY SHE HIM PRESERVE CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY SAFETY WE CONCUR WITH THE OTHER COME OPPONENTS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO FAULT. THANK YOU MUCH NEXT PLEASE. BEEN TRAVIS FROM COSTAR GROUP I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE VOTE NO ON THIS BILL THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. LIKE LIKE SUPPORT -- STEVE ARE COMING OFF THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE DISTRICT ALSO ONE EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU MY CHILD. SEEING NO OTHER OPPOSITION IS BRING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY COMMITTEE MEMBERS COMING MISTER OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SENATOR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. WHEN I LOOK AT AMENDMENTS? IN THE COMMITTEE AND THERE'S VOLUMINOUS AS THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE TAKING I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING HARD. SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENTTO WORK THROUGH ALL OF THE ISSUES IS CERTAINLY COMPLEX TOPIC. AS YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE SPACES WHILE IN LAST YEAR I HAD A BILL. THAT ENACTED SOME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WHEN VIOLATIONS FOR HIGH OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS AND TOLL LANES. WERE ISSUED. AND MY BILL REQUIRED AT THAT. WHEN YOU ISSUE A VIOLATION YOU ALSO INCLUDE THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE OF THE VIOLATION SO THAT THE CONSUMER? YOU KNOW WE HAVE THAT -- INFORMATION THERE AND HAVE THAT AVAILABLE TO CONTEST A VIOLATION IF IT WASN'T VALID SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE PRESERVING THAT BECAUSE THE BILL ORIGINALLY IS DRAFTED INCLUDED IT MODIFIED THAT INCLUDED THE WORDS OR OTHER EVIDENCE. AT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS APPEAR TO TAKE THAT OUT BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL BECAUSE THE AMENDMENTS. IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT ARE IN THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT STATE LAW NOT IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR BILL SO I JUST FIRST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT THOSE THOSE. TWO WORDS ARE BEING TAKEN OUT YEAH MY I MEAN I'VE I'VE TALKED MY STAFF A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND AND THEY SAY THAT THEY WORK THIS OUT -- BUT BUT CERTAINLY IF IF YOU DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH WILL WORK I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR TO ME IT WAS JUST A LITTLE HARD TO TELL. THE OTHER THING THAT THAT I THINK IS STILL A PROBLEM IN THE BILL AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU'RE OPEN TO FIXING THIS. IS THAT -- US ANOTHER SECTION OF YOUR CONCERNS THE CALCULATION OF THE TOLD THE APPROPRIATE TOLL. AND YOUR ADDING THE WORDS INCLUDING THE PROPER TOLL AMOUNT TO THAT SECTION WHERE A WAIT UNTIL YOU. WE WILL DEAL WITH THESE ONE AT A TIME. YEAH I'M I MEAN I'M I THINK WE'RE WE'RE FINE WITH TAKING THAT OUT IF -- IF THE BILL IS FOR OKAY SO THE THE THE FIRST THING I THINK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN OUT BUT BUT THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT ABOUT THAT -- IS THIS THE SECOND -- ONE I THINK IS STILL IN THE BILL AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE OPEN TO TAKING THEM OUT -- IT SAYS IN THIS IS -- BUT SECTION IS THIS. THIS IS THIRTY ONE FORTY M.. IN THE BILL AND IT READS YEAH WHAT WILL TAKE THAT OUT. TO OKAY THE THE WE CLING THE PROPER TELL ABOUT THAT LIMITING THE PROPER TOLL AMOUNT AND YOU UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT WITHOUT ANY NOTICE TO THE CONSUMER. A TOLL AGENCY COULD JUST RE CALCULATE THE AMOUNT AND I I THINK THAT IF THE CONSUMERS REPRESENTING SOMETHING ABOUT OCCUPANCY THAT THEY OUGHT TO GET A NOTICE OF VIOLATION. HE ALSO GOT A NOTICE THAT THAT WOULD THAT THAT'S BEING TAKEN ALSO THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMITMENT YEAH. I PLEASE I MEAN I YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN SUCH A REAL CHAMPION THIS ISSUE A NUMBER OF YOU I LOOK AROUND THIS TABLE I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE. ALL THESE PRIVACY CHAMPIONS AROUND THE TABLE AND SO IT AS AS MORE OF THESE ISSUES COME UP PLEASE. SHARE THEM WITH US AND I WILL GET THEM ADDRESS THAT YOU KNOW. I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS FOCUSED ON ON WHAT I SAID THE BEGINNING WHICH IS. ALLOWING THEM TO DO THEIR WORK IN TERMS OF COLLECTIONS THAT SORT OF THING AND THAT'S IT. TEACHER DILIGENCE INVESTMENT WORK ON THE BILL YEAH RESPOND QUE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN I THINK THAT YOUR GOAL HERE WHICH IS TO PROTECT THE TAXPAYERS MONEY WHICH THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE GOING TO FIX THE ROADS GOES TO DO THAT IS -- IMPORTANT ONE I I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND YOUR FOR THE AMENDMENTS I THINK YOU'RE DRESSED MOST OF MY CONCERNS ON THE BILL WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATED -- I THINK IT IS MUCH BETTER IN ITS CURRENT FORM -- BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS IN MY BRIEF TENURE HERE ON THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE I HAVE. ALL I THINK IN EVERY INSTANCE SEEN THAT THE DURATION IN WHICH WE THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO WITH TO RETAIN DATA IS APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS. THE BILL AND I KNOW THIS ISN'T A CHANGE BUT HOW WE'RE CHANGING THE LOS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT. IN THE BILL. THEY HAVE FOR YEARS AND SIX MONTHS AFTER SOMEBODY CLOSE AN ACCOUNT FOR A FINE IS SETTLED THAT SEEMS LIKE A VERY LONG TIME FOR THIS DATA BE RETAINED. HAS ANY THOUGHT BEEN GIVEN TO AMENDING THAT. YEAH THE BEN RUBIN YEAH THANK YOU ADD TO SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE THE CONCERN THERE WAS THAT UNDER THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW THERE'S A FOUR YEAR STATURE LIMITATIONS. AND IN THE LAWSUITS AGAINST THE CONTRACTORS FOR THE TOLL AGENCIES THEY'RE STARTING A FOR YOUR STATURE LIMITATIONS. IN IF WE ONLY HAVE THE INFORMATION FOR SIX MONTHS. AGENCIES WILL BE ABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES OF THE CONTRACTORS AGAINST THOSE CHALLENGES SO THAT'S WHY IT'S A FOR YEARS AND SIX MONTHS TIME PERIOD IS BECAUSE UNDER THEM FOR COMPETITION LAW. THE FOR YOUR SEDIMENTATION. AND IF WE WOULD BAR ALL CLAIMS AGAINST TOLL AGENCIES OR THE CONTRACTORS UNDER THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW. WE WOULD NEED THAT TIME PERIOD BUT IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SERVING THOSE CHALLENGES THAT'S NECESSARY GOT IT OKAY. AND THEN I AM. I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE SECTION. FOUR ZERO TWO FIVE BE WHICH IS THE SECTION RELATED TO NOTICE TO CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR FINES. SO I WAS RECENTLY DRIVING ORANGE COUNTY AND NOT BEING FROM ORANGE COUNTY ENDED UP ON A TOLL ROAD WITHOUT KNOWING IT DIDN'T HAVE MY FAST TRACK -- MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING AND I THOUGHT OH NO WELL I'LL JUST GO ON THEIR WEBSITE AND I'LL PAY THE TOLL. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THERE IS NO WAY FOR ME TO PAY THE TOLL PROSPECTIVELY UNLESS I HAD MY TOLL TAG. SO HERE I WAS ON A TOLL ROAD WHICH DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS DOING IT I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THEY SENT ME SOMETHING IN HOPES THAT GOT TO ME. SO I WOULD AS I SEE THIS THE BEST EFFORT WOULD INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO PAY THE TOLL UP FRONT TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING TO DO THAT SO. I GUESS I JUST SEE THIS AS YOU KNOW WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS A PRETTY STRONG THING TO PROVIDE. AND TO PROVIDE IT WITHOUT MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF OUR TOLL PROVIDERS ARE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO PAY THESE TOLLS IS SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE. DO YOU WANT TO SAVE HIS USING I I MEAN I WAS IN ORDER NOT TO LONG AGO AND PAID MY TOLL I DIDN'T HAVE MY FAST I GOT PAID RIGHT AFTERWARDS BUT IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH. YOU'VE GOT THE THERE IS A WAY TO PAY HEARING IT YEAH MY MY APOLOGY -- MEMBERS IF OUR INFORMATION WAS A PERFECTLY CLEAR BUT DEFINITELY WHEN YOU USE THAT TOLL ROADS IN ORANGE COUNTY YOU CAN PAY FIVE DAYS BEFORE WITHOUT ACCOUNT YOU CAN PAY FIVE DAYS AFTER. AND ALSO IF YOU FORGET TO PAY AND YOU GET A VIOLATION WE HAVE AN AMNESTY PROGRAM WHERE AS LONG AS YOU PAY THE TOLL WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. ALL PENALTIES ARE WAY TO DO WE KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE TOLL ROAD IN CALIFORNIA I CAN GO ON AND PAY PROACTIVELY. I KNOW THAT YOU TO REPRESENT ALL THE TOLL ROAD SO I'M PROBABLY ASKING QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER BUT I GUESS THAT I WOULD INCLUDE THAT IN THE DEFINITION RIGHT THE DEFINITION HERE IS OF YOU SEEKING OUT BUT I THINK THE ABILITY FOR CONSUMERS TO GO AND PAY THOSE TOLLS. SHOULD ALSO BE INCLUDED. AND I DON'T I MEAN I YOU PROBABLY CAN'T FIX EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW I WOULD EXPECT YOU. TO AS AS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA TOLD OKAY I THINK THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION OKAY -- I DEFINITELY KNOW THAT ALL THE AGENCIES HAVE TO AMNESTY PROGRAM THAT I MENTIONED IN PLACE AND YOU KNOW WE MIGHT DO IT DIFFERENTLY BUT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES. AND WE ALL OFFER WAIVERS OF PENALTIES IN TERMS OF A PROACTIVE NOTICE IF THAT'S SOMETHING -- THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO SEE GOING FORWARD IN WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE -- THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT WORK -- TO MAKE SURE IT'S CONSISTENT -- IN TERMS OF PROCESS ACROSS ALL THE TOLL FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA OKAY BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S A CONSUMER WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO JUST GO ONLINE AND PAY THAT KNOWING I HAD MADE A MISTAKE RIGHT. RATHER HAVE TO WAIT FOR NOTICED COME TO ME BUT THEN AGAIN I MAY HAVE NOT BEEN AN ORANGE COUNTY BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE SPEAKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT TORRENT -- AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION -- WAS [inaudible] THIRTY ONE SO. THIRTY ONE FOUR NINETY I WHICH IS THE SECTION THAT RELATES TO THE SHARING OF INFORMATION -- IT TALKS ABOUT THE REASON YOU WOULD SHARE IT RATE -- WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO IN THE PERFORMANCE OF COLLECTION AND ETCETERA ETCETERA. IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SHARING IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE DUTIES WHICH IS A CONCERN FOR ME RIGHT YOU DO YOU HAVE A LOT MORE INFORMATION THEY NEED THEN IT NEEDS TO BE SHARED WITH THE DMV TO PERFORM YOUR DUTIES. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT NARROWED SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE YOU'RE DOING IT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS BUT YOU'RE ALSO ONLY SHARING THE DATA THAT IS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THAT. BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED TO SHARE WITH THE DMV WHAT LANE I WAS IN OR WHAT BRIDGE I WAS HONORED CETERA ETCETERA RIGHT IN ORDER TO GET MY ADDRESS. YES AND WE DEFINITELY WORK WITH THE DMV AND IT HERE TO THEIR STANDARDS IN TERMS OF THE FIELDS AND DATA WE HAVE TO SUBMIT TO WORK WITH THEIR SYSTEM. BUT I I I DON'T SEE YOUR REQUEST AS UNREASONABLE I THINK IF YEAH I WANTED TO SEE MORE DEFINITION. AROUND THAT I THINK LAYING OUT THE EXACT DATA WE SHARE IN EACH INSTANCE WOULD MAKE THE BILL AWFUL ALL RIGHT -- BECAUSE WE ARE VERY SELECTIVE AND DEPENDING ON THE PURPOSE. OF THAT PARTICULAR CONTRACT IN THE FUNCTION WE DO LIMITED DATA THATWE WOULD SHARE WITH THEM JUST LIKE WE DO WITH INTER OPERABILITY. RIGHT BUT I THINK YOU COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE SAY ONLY THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO PERFORM HIS DUTIES FOR EXAMPLE I WHICH IS I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU KNOW WE HEAR IT THE REPAIR REASON WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE OF GRAY AREA SOMEONE WE SITE SOMETHING LIGHT. AS NECESSARY IS THAT GOING TO CREATE ANOTHER GRAY AREA WHERE. ONE GROUP MAY SAY NECESSARY MEANT THIS AND ANOTHER GROUP. SAYS NO IT MEANT THIS. RIGHT WELL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WEEK THAT SOME OF THE TOLL AGENCIES HAVE BEEN SHARING MORE DATA THE NECESSARY WHICH IS WHY I SAY THIS AND SO I THINK THAT TALKING ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE SHARED IS IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE. WE NOT JUST THE THE PURPOSE OF THIS YEAR. ON UNDERSTATEMENT -- EIGHT YOU KNOW I I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT ASSERTION BY I I DO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL MISTER ONE GO AHEAD -- IF I YOU KNOW I I APPRECIATE SENATOR ALLEN ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE ALREADY DONE AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- YOU'VE TAKEN AND I AM GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY -- BUT AS WE'VE HEARD I THINK THERE'S STILL -- ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND AND TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T DEGRADE THE OF PRIVACY -- THE LEVEL OF PRIVACY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN TOLL PAYER SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO NARROW THE SCOPE AND MAKE SURE THAT -- THE SHARING FOCUSES ONLY ON THE TOLL COLLECTING FUNCTIONS AND WE NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE DATA IS NOT BEING USED FOR MARKETING OR NON TOLD RELATED ACTIVITIES MR GALLAGHER. YEAH JUST REALLY QUICKLY I MEAN -- ONE I I I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRING THIS BILL FORD IN IT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE -- IN WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. BE AWARE I START FROM IS YOU KNOW WE ARE DEALING WITH AN INDUSTRY AREA THAT'S ALREADY HAS THESE TYPE PARAMETERS OF MEN PUT AROUND IT FROM THIS A MILLION LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED -- IT'S IN IN A WAY ALMOST LOOK IT THIS IS PROBABLY WHAT A LOT OF OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. SHOULD HAVE IN PLACE THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE -- AND AND ENSURE THAT DATA IS NOT BEING SOLD. OR YOU KNOW MISUSED. BUT THIRD PARTIES AND IT REALLY. WHAT I GET FROM THIS IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS TRYING TO KEEP THIS REALLY TIGHT SO THAT YOU CAN USE IT FOR ENFORCEMENT -- AND TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IN TERMS OF PAYING THE TOLLS THAT -- YOU KNOW AND AND THAT THAT'S NOT BEING SOMEHOW SUBVERTED AND THE CONCERN BEING THAT. UPS BECAUSE OF RECENT LEGISLATION YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE. TO YEAH AND AND OBVIOUSLY. THE LITIGATION THAT HAS TRANSPIRED -- YOU KNOW SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T THAT THIS PROHIBITS YOU FROM SHARING. WITH THE AND THE FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU FOR A LEAD FOR LEGITIMATE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS SO NEAR TO ME I SEE IT AS A YOU KNOW A TIGHT. FIX -- TO AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE'VE ALREADY I MIGHT ASK KAY. WE KNOW WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES -- AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HOW THEIR SH YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE SHARING DATA AND AND HOW THEY'RE VULNERABLE. I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THEM AS IT WOULD BE. MY QUESTION BUT YEAH. ANYWAY I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. MISS WICKS GUY. YEAH -- THANKS FOR BRINGING THE BILL -- YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES IN MADE AROUND REALLY MAKING SURE REGARDING PRIVACY PROTECTING PRIVACY I CAN SEE WHY WE NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THE AMENDMENTS AND COMPARING THAT SCOPE IN. YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH TO MOVE THE BILL FOR TODAY BUT I AM ASKING YOU TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS YOUR NORTH STAR REALLY PROTECT NOT PRIVATE SIX IT'S GOING GOOD. VERY CRITICAL AND A LOT OF THE STAKEHOLDERS TO COME TO THE TABLE -- I VALUE THEIR OPINION IN JUDGMENT ON THE STUFF AND HOPE THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE THE THE CONVERSATION WITH THOSE THAT ARE OPPOSING. TWENTY ALSO THANK THE SENATOR AND HIS TEAM FOR WORKING WITH US -- THE LAST FEW WEEKS -- ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO I I HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AND IN IN MY OFFICE IN AND TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I CAME UP WITH AT THAT POINT WAS -- THERE'S NO WAY THAT IS GONNA YOU KNOW -- BE TAKEN OF THIS YEAR I HAD TO BE A TO YOUR BILL. NOW SINCE THEN -- WE CONVENED A STAKEHOLDERS MEETING OBVIOUSLY ABOUT BY BRINGING BOTH SIDES TOGETHER. AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT -- YOU KNOW. WE ALL SAT DOWN AND TALKED AND THE TEAMS THAT IS. OUR AND DO YOU KNOW WE'RE MUCH CLOSER THAN WE WERE THREE THREE WEEKS AGO AND AS MENTIONED -- AS WE HEARD EARLIER. ALL THE SENATOR HAS ACCEPTED A LOT OF IN FACT ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT'S BEEN THE PROPOSED. ON AND I THINK -- THE AMENDMENTS GO QUITE A BIT OF A WAYS -- IMAGES SHARE SOME THOUGHTS WITH YOU ON OUR ON WHERE I AM ON THE BILL. I THINK SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS SEARCH BEEN TAKEN ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS -- TO REVOKE CONSENT. ARE TO HAVE THEIR INFORMATION SURE FOR MARKETING PURPOSES AND ALSO IMPROVING HOW THE AGENCIES DETERMINE. THE INDIVIDUALS ADDRESS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SENDING A VIOLATION NOTICE. YET. THERE ARE STILL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT ARE STILL PROBLEMATIC -- IN MY VIEW -- AS APPLIED RETROACTIVELY AND ALL SOUL PROSPECTIVELY. OUR SPECIFICALLY THE BILL EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS ALLOWS TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES TO SHARE THE INDIVIDUAL'S PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH ANY CONTRACTOR HAS BEEN MENTION. OF FOR THE OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE TOLL COLLECTION SYSTEM. THIS IS -- AN EXPANSION OF WHAT IS SO ALLOW UNDER EXISTING LAW. NOW APPLY PROSPECTIVELY I HAVE CONCERNS THAT AGENCIES WOULD NOT BE INCENTIVIZE TO LIMIT THE SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. OF WHAT IS NECESSARY -- TO COMPLETE A TASK. NO THIS COULD RESULT IN NOT A LARGE DATABASE FULL OF INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL INFORMATION. ARE NOW IS AS THE CO AUTHOR OF THE THE PRIVACY BILL THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR THAT THE CCPA. I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT -- BUT I'M I'M EVEN MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF THE BILL. OUR FIRST AHA I BELIEVE THAT LEGISLATION SHOULD APPLY PROSPECTIVELY. ARE TO AVOID ANY -- TO AVOID. INTERFERING WITH ANY PENDING LITIGATION. WHEN APPLIED RETROACTIVELY I'M CONCERNED AT THIS EXPANSION? OF WILL ALLOW INTO THESE THAT HAVE WILEY TO THE LONG TO OF AVOID BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE VIOLATIONS. AND EVEN WORSE SO WILL PREVENT INJURE THE PARTIES FROM SEEKING REDRESS. I'M I THINK -- THE PROPONENTS HAVE ARGUED THAT MANY OF THESE PLAINTIFF SUFFER NO HARM AND AGENCIES ACT WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF THE ORIGINAL. LEGISLATION. NO I THINK THAT IF IF THERE ARE TRULY FRIVOLOUS CITATIONS BEING FILED. I THINK THE PROPER PLACE -- TO DISCERN OR ADJUDICATE WOULD BE WOULD BE ALL IN THE COURT SYSTEM. INSTEAD OF REWRITING THE LAW. ARE THERE IS NOT TO SAY THAT -- UNLIMITED LIABILITY FOR TOLL AGENCIES IS NOT A PROBLEM. OUR MILLIONS OF TAX PAYERS DOLLARS HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN THAT WHOLE ROSE AS WE HEARD. ALL AND MANY OF US RELY ON THEM AND YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT -- ANY RETROACTIVITY ARE THAT WE TAKE ON SHOULD BE LIMITED TO JUST AMENDMENTS THAT TRULY CLARIFY THE LAW AND DO NOT WATER DOWN. ANY RIGHT SO THAT CALIFORNIA'S HOUSE. WITH RESPECT TO THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR ANY CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALL INTENDED TO IN THE SOME INDIAN LEGISLATION. HAVING SAID ALL THAT -- I I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TO MOVE IT FORWARD IF I HAVE THE SENATORS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS I THINK EARLIER YOU INDICATED THAT YOU WOULD DO SO. SO I THINK THERE ARE STILL ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO KIND OF FINE TUNE GOING FORWARD. BUT BUT I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT IT AND YOU KNOW CAN I ASK YOU TO BE MINDFUL OF THOSE ISSUES THAT I MENTIONED -- REGARDING RETROACTIVITY AND YOU KNOW THE POTENTIAL OF INTERFERING WITH THE PENDING LITIGATION. OUR BE MINDFUL OF THAT ICE I THINK -- WE DON'T WANT TO BE ACCUSED OF YOU KNOW RIGHT WRITING LAW OR REWRITING LAWS THAT WOULD -- IMPACT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COURT SYSTEM AND THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF MY CONCERNS SO TO FEED IT. YOU KNOW -- ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES IF YOU LIKE IN AN HOUR AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE. YEAH I LOOK I APPRECIATE ALL COMMENTS YOU JUST MAY MISTER CHAIR I THINK -- IN THE OTHER DAY I THINK WE'RE VERY MUCH IN LINE I CERTAINLY GIVE YOU MY COMMITMENT TO TAKE TO TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE VERY CLOSELY. ON BOTH OF THE OPPOSITION -- THE SUPPORTERS BUT I ACTUALLY I REALLY DO I'M [inaudible] APPRECIATE. THE THE THE THE ENGAGEMENT OF YOUR COMMITTEE -- COMMITTEE STAFF -- I DO I DO THINK YOU PARTICULARLY GIVEN YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE WITH THE PRIVACY BILL LAST YEAR IS AS OR SEEN AS SOMEONE WHO'S. GOT A LOT OF INTEGRITY AND A LOT OF FUN. A LOT OF OF OF CREDIBILITY ON THIS ISSUE. AND I I I THINK YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY SEVERAL TIMES CONSIDER YOUNG I REALLY THINK IT BEARS REPEATING -- THIS REALLY IS ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT THAT. IT. TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE ALLOWED FREDDIE RETROACTIVITY IT IS SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE. OF OF FILLING THAT THE YOU KNOW WHAT IS TO ME THE CLEAR INTENT. OF THIS COMMITTEE AND BILL -- WHICH INVOLVES ALLOWING THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES TO DO THEIR BASIC WORK -- INVOLVING -- TOLD MANAGEMENT IN COLLECTION. AND ANYTHING BEYOND THAT I THINK IS A IS NOT WHAT I'M LOOKING TO DO I WITH THIS BILL AND SO ON YOU TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMMITTEE WANTS. YEAH I I WOULD LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO BE HONEST I TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE. OUR TO THE SENATE THERE ARE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS OR YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL REFINEMENTS THAT YOU -- WANT TO MAKE TO TO ENSURE THAT WHAT I JUST. STATE IT IS MY CLEAR INTENT -- IS IS IS IS A FACTUAL IN IN IN IN IN THE FINAL LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL. THAT THAT'S THAT'S ALL OUR EFFORT IS ABOUT -- SO YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO SEE LITERALLY BILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. IMPERILED ARE BECAUSE OF TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS -- OF OF OF BUT OF THE LAW THAT. ARE THERE THAT ARE THAT THAT ARE NOT IN LINE WITH THE INTENT. AS STATED BY SUBMITTING WHEN HE PUT THE BILL FORD [inaudible] ON THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING I REALLY FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT AS BOTH THE TAXPAYER AND IS A USER OF OF TRANSIT IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE -- BUT BUT ALL THE COMMENTS THAT ARE MADE ABOUT PRIVACY I CARE A LOT ABOUT MYSELF I WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE NO IMPACT ON THE CPA -- AND YOU KNOW I INVITE THE COMMITTEES YOU CAN CONTINUE TO ENGAGEMENT. ON THIS BILL IF IT GETS OUT TODAY -- TO ENSURE THAT THE INTENT THAT I TO STATUS. IS -- IS CASE CLEARLY EFFECTUATE A MAP AND IN THE FINAL PRODUCT HERE. VERY GOOD WITH THAT -- WAS AT YOUR CLOSER. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY SOMEWHERE. I NEED A MOTION. THIS THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED SO IF YOU FEEL YOU KNOW WOULD LIKE TO HAVE WELL WE BROUGHT TOGETHER YOU KNOW POLITICIANS LAWYERS AND TOLL OPERATORS THROUGH THE MOST POPULAR. TYPES OF PEOPLE. AND THAT'S QUITE ACHIEVEMENT AND I I I KNOW I I I REALLY DO YEAH YOU GUYS ARE THE MOST POPULAR TOLL. TO OPERATORS. I GUESS YEAH. WE FINALLY FOUND A GROUP IT'S LESS POPULAR THAN LAWYERS. I'M A LAWYER I'M ALIVE. I KNOW BUT I I I I REALLY DID YOU FOR ME THIS IS ABOUT -- LEADING OUR OUR TRANSIT AND TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. DO THEIR WORK. AND THAT'S ALL THIS IS ABOUT. AND SO I I'VE HEARD ALL THE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE WE'RE GONNA YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I'D ADDRESS ISSUES RAISED BY SUMMER OBERNOLTE -- I THINK THIS PERSPECTIVE PAYING ISSUE IF WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR ON THE WEBSITES AROUND THE STATE WE OUGHT TO DO THAT -- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF I I'M I'M HEARING THIS KIND OF DEBATE ABOUT HOW WE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE SPECIFY. INFORMATION THAT THAT THAT CAN BE SHARED -- I MEAN I I HEAR YOU BUT THE SAME TIME I YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'RE HEARING FROM THE COMMITTEE. ABOUT THE NEED TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER INFORMATION IS HERE IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE OF THE TRANSIT AGENCY SO WE NEED. TO TO FINESSE THAT LANGUAGE AND GET IT TO A A GOOD PLACE -- AND I I ALSO HEARD ALL THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER KIND OF SWEEP OF THIS BILL GO THROUGH THE VARIOUS ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. AND AND JUST ADDRESS EVERY SINGLE THING WE POSSIBLY CAN -- YOU KNOW I WILL SAY THE OPPOSITION I THINK YOU FOR ME SEE OVER AND OVER AGAIN I I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK. BUT BUT BUT YOU KNOW THE THE PRIVATE INFORMATION CANNOT BE USED FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES FOR MARKETING. AND CANNOT BE USED FOR ACTIVITIES THAT GO BEYOND -- IT THE THE THE CORE FUNCTIONS OF WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WITH THE OPERATION. OF THESE TOLL ROADS AND SO ON SO WE'VE GOT TO KEEP KEEP JUST HAMMERED AWAY GOING INTO THE DETAILS WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. WORKING WITH WHATEVER MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE WANTS TO ENGAGE -- AND AND AND AND GET TO A PLACE THAT WE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH. AND WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE TO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SECRETARY -- WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

SB SEVEN THIRTY I DO PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE READY YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- APPRECIATE. YOUR TIME APOLOGIES FOR THE DELAY MEMBERS -- FIRST ONE WE THINK THEY COMMITTEE STAFFER THE DIALOGUE AND TRY TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE ISSUES -- SO THE THE THE AMENDMENT -- THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN WRESTLING WITH IT I KNOW WE'RE STILL TRYING TO SORT OF WORK THIS THROUGH WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THERE'S STILL SOME OUTSTANDING ISSUES SO -- WE WANT TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT GOING FORWARD BUT I FROM OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHAIR SOUNDED AMENABLE TO LEAVING THAT ASIDE FOR THE DAY AND THEN SORT OF WORKING ON THAT ISSUE OF WHAT EXACTLY -- WHICH WAY AN EQUITY STAKE FLOWS -- SHOULD BE RESOLVED TO APPRECIATE THAT UP FRONT I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. THE CALIFORNIA HOME OF TECHNIQUE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND THERE ARE HUGE HUGE OPPORTUNITIES THAT BEEN A MALE AVAILABLE TO US TO LIVE OUR LIVES MORE CONVENIENTLY TO ACCESS OUR DATA WHEN EVERYONE. THROUGH THE CLOUD OF FINDING CONVENIENCE IS OUR DAILY LIVES BUT THERE'S ALSO CHALLENGES THAT GO. WITH THE GROWTH OF THIS TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL SECTOR -- AND THOSE MAY ENTAIL NOT JUST ISSUES AROUND LABOR AND AUTOMATION WHICH WE'VE SEEN MANY TIMES THE LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF ISSUES AROUND A PRIVACY THAT WE'VE SEEN ELEVATED THIS YEAR WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE -- AND ALSO ABOUT THE VALUE OF OURSELVES AND OUR DATA INTO THE SYSTEM -- A PERSON CAN'T BE REDUCED INTO JUST DOLLARS AND CENTS BUT RIGHT NOW THE WAY WE INTERACT WITH TECHNOLOGY -- WE ARE QUANTIFIED IN THAT WAY AND SOME INTERNAL PROCESS THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS REALLY TO TRY TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY WHICH DOESN'T JUST LIVE IN THE CLOUD. WAS HERE ESTABLISHING CALIFORNIA AS THEIR HEARTLAND TO TAKE MORE OF AN EQUITY STAKE IN SOME OF THE COST BUT ALSO THE BENEFITS OF INNOVATION. AND REALLY TRYING TO THINK THROUGH A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AS OPPOSED TO JUST TRYING TO LEGISLATE. SOME SOLUTION TO GET THE SAME KIND OF DILIGENCE BEING DONE AROUND THE FUTURE OF WORK BY THE GOVERNOR NOW -- INTO A SORT OF BROADER QUESTION THAN JUST -- IMPACTS ON LABOR MARKETS SO TO BE THINKING ABOUT -- IMPACTS ON HOUSING -- ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND ON DEMOCRACY I NOTE -- CHAIRMAN BERMAN WITH THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING ON CYBERSECURITY ISSUES -- JOURNALISM IS COLLAPSING IN MANY CASES WE HAVE NEWS DESERT'S EMERGING ALL OVER THE PLACE -- IT'S AND IT'S ONE THING TO PLAY THE BLAME GAME BUT IT'S ANOTHER TO ACTUALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS COMMISSION CAN ACTUALLY COME UP WITH SOME PROACTIVE SOLUTIONS TO DEALING WITH SOME THESE BIG GAPS. THEY WERE FACING -- IN CALIFORNIA AND MAYBE IF WE BECOME A SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SCALE THIS TO COVER THE REST THE COUNTRY -- SO HOPEFULLY THIS COMMISSION -- SETS A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE GIVES LEGISLATURE A HEAVY HAND IN DECIDING THOSE OUTCOMES AND COMES BACK TO US -- WE SOME OF FEEDBACK THAT WE CAN MOVE ON IN THE FUTURE YEARS -- I WANTED TO OFFER TESTIMONY FROM AERIAL FOX JOHNSON HERE WITH COMMON SENSE MEDIA AND A HAPPY TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. I WOULD I WOULD SAY KEEP IT BRIEF AND BASED ON THE DON'T TALK PASS YES. GREAT -- R. F. I. TONSON WITH COMMON SENSE MEDIA NATIONAL NONPROFIT ADVOCATING FOR HEALTHY DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM WE REPRESENT MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION PARENTS FAMILIES STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS ACROSS THE NATION WHO WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THEY CAN HARNESS THE POWER BE AND TECHNOLOGY. FOR LEARNING IN LIFE. TAX REFORM MEANS MORE THAN JUST PROTECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION OBVIOUSLY WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AS CO SPONSORS THE CCPA. TECH COMPANIES ARE BENEFITING FROM A DATA CONNIE AND THEY NEED TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH DISPLACEMENT AND GROWING INCOME INEQUALITY. WE FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO CONTRIBUTE TO COMMUNITIES WITHOUT COMPROMISING INDIVIDUALS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY PRIVACY. TECH COMPANIES PROFIT OFF OF US THEY SHOULD BE PAYING BACK TO SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS AND NEIGHBORHOODS. CORPORATE PROFITS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING MY TECH COMPANIES ARE AN ALL TIME HIGH. BUT THE PORTION OF TAX REVENUE CALIFORNIA RECEIVED FROM CORPORATIONS AS CLOSE TO ITS LOWEST POINT AND FORTY YEARS. THEY HAVE TO BE ACCOUNT HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE IMPACT OF MISINFORMATION THE MANIPULATION OF OUR DEMOCRACY. AND THE THREAT THAT THEY COULD POSE TO OUR FREE PRESS. CALIFORNIA HAS THE WORLD'S MOST INNOVATIVE TECH COMPANIES WORKING ON SOLVING SOME OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES OF OUR TIME WILL DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY THAT MAKES OUR LIVES AFER HEALTHIER AND MORE CONNECTED. BUT AS WE SEE MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY THIS INNOVATION ECONOMY WE THINK IT'S TIME FOR TECH TO GET BACK THEY SHOULD CREATE NOT LIMIT OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. EQUITY MEANS AS IT RELATES TO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT. THROUGH THIS ACT WE HOPE TO EXPLORE TAX IMPACTS ON INEQUALITY OUR WORKFORCE THE FUTURE OF A FREE PRESS AND TAX IMPACT ON OUR DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL CAPITAL. THIS WILL HAPPEN BY ENGAGING THE COMMUNITIES AND SECTORS MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THIS AND WITH THE MOST AT STAKE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS SENATOR START TO REALIZE A JUST AND EQUITABLE TECH FUTURE FOR ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. MEMBERS THE PUBLIC IN OPPOSITION SEEING NONE WILL BRING BACK THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. THANKS FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER -- THANKS COMMON SENSE MEDIA FOR BEING A PART OF THIS -- GRAPPLING WITH SOME REALLY VEXING ISSUES HERE A LOT OF A CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES I THINK WE HAVE IN THE STATE -- LOVE THE BILL OF A FORD WOULD LIKE TO BE CALLED HER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I JUST HAD OBSERVATION I I'D BEEN STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH THIS BILL SENATOR AND IT'S BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND I COMPLETELY SUPPORT THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE BILL. I THINK THAT THAT KIND OF EQUITY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- INCOME INEQUALITY AS YOU POINT OUT HAS GOTTEN WORSE THROUGH THE TECHNICAL REVOLUTION. AND I'VE SAID BEFORE THAT I THINK IT'S THE DEFINING CHALLENGE OF OUR GENERATION TO TRY TO DRESS THAT INEQUALITY SOME VERY SUPPORT OF THOSE THINGS BUT I'M A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH POINTING THE FINGER AT THE TECHNICAL REVOLUTION. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES BECAUSE? IF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC DATA. THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN THE GREATEST ENABLER OF THE CLASSES OF PEOPLE THAT. WE'RE TRYING TO HELP IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY. YEAH AND IF YOU DEFINE. EMPOWER MEN NOT JUST AS INCOME INEQUALITY BUT ALSO AS EQUITY AND YOU COMPARE IT TO THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WE HAVE A LOT MORE EQUITY NOW THAN WE DID DOWN. BECAUSE BACK THEN YOU HAD FACTORY OWNERS WHO JUST BY ACCIDENT OF BIRTH. WERE ABLE TO COMMAND THESE HUGE RETURNS ON THEIR WORKERS GOT NOTHING WHEREAS IN TECHNOLOGY WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT -- IT'S MUCH MUCH MORE BROADLY BASED NOW IT IS TRUE THAT. IT TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE WINNERS AND LOSERS BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE AND TRAINING TO EMPLOY AND THEREFORE THAT CREATES THAT ANY QUALITY BUT THAT'S A MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND NUANCED ISSUE AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY I'M A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE. WITH THE BILL BUT A VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT AND JUST ONE LAST COMMENT IN YES BUT I HATE TO BE A LITTLE CYNICAL BUT WE'RE ALL IN GOVERNMENT HERE -- YOU KNOW WE WE SEEM TO BE IMPLYING WITH THIS LEGISLATION THAT MORE GOVERNMENT AND INTERVENTION REGULATION IS GOING TO MAKE THE SITUATION BETTER -- BECAUSE NO ONE HAS EVER FAILED TO BE TRUTHFUL. SO SO THAT'S ANOTHER TO PIECES SKEPTICISM THAT I HAVE BUT I KNOW YOUR HEARTS IN THIS IN THE RIGHT PLACE MY HEART'S WITH YOU I JUST I JUST STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION. I I APPRECIATE THAT -- MISTER VICE CHAIR YES -- AND I DO I DON'T WANT THE THESIS OF THIS LEGISLATION TO BE ONE OF ACCUSATION AND I ACTUALLY I'M I'M OPEN TO THINKING THROUGH WITH YOU. HOW TO CAPTURE -- REALLY ACCURATELY THE THE BENEFITS THEY'RE OF OF DEMOCRATIZING ECONOMIC POWER THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- MY SENSE IS THAT THE INDUSTRY ACTUALLY WANTS TO STEP UP AND TRY TO TAKE A LITTLE DIFFERENT ROLE YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME OUT COMPANIES LIKE MICROSOFT -- AND SOME OTHER LEADERS IN THE FIELD -- THEY'RE ANXIOUS TO FIND A BETTER VENUES IN THE CURRENT SORT OF CAT AND MOUSE GAME THAT WE'RE PLAYING OF SHUT IT ALL DOWN OR AUTHORIZED EVERYTHING SO I'M HOPING TO FIND THAT SWEET -- BUT I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS AND FEEL ALLOW ME TO TREAT THAT AS MY CLOTHES ARE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL.
