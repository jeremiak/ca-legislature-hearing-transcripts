00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:23.234

THESE CONDITIONS ARE

00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:42.220

SIMPLY TRYING TO PRESERVE YOUR

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.834

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.769
AT THE THE PROMISE OF THE

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:41.537
MEASURE IS 50% IN ONE OF

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:43.239
ANYTHING THERE'S I CAN PROMISE

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.941
YOU THERE'S NOT 50% OF THE

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:46.309
COUNTY TREASURY.

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:47.910
AND ANY OF THE FIFTY EIGHT

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.178
COUNTIES INVESTED IN ONE THING

01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:52.115
AND 30% SEEMS.

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:53.616
A PRETTY HEALTHY NUMBER OF THIS

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.818
THAT THE SURPLUS DOLLARS 50%

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.387
COULD GET INTO YOU COULD GET

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:58.888
INTO REAL TROUBLE.

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:01.090
AND BECOME ILLIQUID UNDER THE

01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:03.393
CITY REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:04.794
RELATED.

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:06.029
TO AFTER ORANGE COUNTY WENT

01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:07.530
BANKRUPT IT'S SAFETY FIRST THE

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:09.432
RETURN OF PRINCIPLE NOT RETURN

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:10.700
ON PRINCIPLE.

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:12.168
AND THEN LIQUIDITY AND THEN

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:13.302
YOU'LL NOT BE THE THIRD THING

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:14.704
YOU CONSIDER BUT LIQUIDITY MUST

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:16.773
BE READILY AVAILABLE AND THE 50%

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:18.307
OF THE DOLLARS ARE INVESTED IN

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:19.208
ONE THING.

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:22.779
IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT -- TO

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:26.616
TO ACCESS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:29.285

ALL THE ENTITIES HAVE A WIDE

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:37.794

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:39.695
CHOICE.

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:41.130
SO.

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:44.200
JUST BECAUSE IT'S 50% IN ONE

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:45.168
FUND.

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:48.237
HEY MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT.

01:01:48.304 --> 01:01:49.772

PUBLICLY OWNED SITES AND HOW

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:09.434
THEY ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED.

02:10:09.501 --> 02:10:11.403
THIS IS TO PROVIDE CLARITY ON

02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:13.238
WHAT LAND EVEN EXISTS -- IF YOU

02:10:13.305 --> 02:10:15.607
ASK MANY LOCAL AGENCIES THEY DO

02:10:15.674 --> 02:10:18.010
NOT FULLY KNOW WHAT THEY OWN --

02:10:18.076 --> 02:10:19.811
IT WILL CREATE A PROCESS FOR

02:10:19.878 --> 02:10:21.313
STATE PLANS THAT MIRRORS THE

02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:24.016

THE SAME PROCESS PURPLE.

02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:38.997

GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE.

02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:03.689

BRING UP TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED

02:13:15.087 --> 02:13:16.922
UNITS INTO THECOMING YEARS --

02:13:16.988 --> 02:13:18.623

COLLABORATION WITH CITIES WERE

02:13:23.195 --> 02:13:24.363
ALSO ESTIMATING THE DEVELOPING

02:13:24.429 --> 02:13:26.565

02:13:33.705 --> 02:13:34.940
I LIKE THAT MY REMARKS WITH THE

02:13:35.006 --> 02:13:36.608

PARCEL.

02:13:41.747 --> 02:13:43.048
THAT WAS DâN DONATED TO HABITAT

02:13:43.115 --> 02:13:44.249
FOR HUMANITY.

02:13:44.316 --> 02:13:45.650
THAT HABITAT WAS ABLE -- TO FOR

02:13:45.717 --> 02:13:47.352
BUILD ITS FIRST HOME -- THROUGH

02:13:47.419 --> 02:13:54.459
THIS PARTNERSHIP AND EVEN THOUGH

TOOK PLACE -- I KNOW IT SO WELL

02:13:56.895 --> 02:13:57.462
BECAUSE IT WAS MY FAMILY THAT

02:13:57.529 --> 02:13:58.096
ACTUALLY HAD THE CHANCE TO LIVE

02:13:58.163 --> 02:13:59.931
IN THAT HOME -- FOR MY IMMIGRANT

02:13:59.998 --> 02:14:00.699

02:14:03.802 --> 02:14:05.537
AND GAME CHANGER AND CERTAINLY

IN FROM DIXON THE VALLEJO IT'S

02:41:47.998 --> 02:41:49.332
PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT THERE'S A

02:41:49.399 --> 02:41:51.334
SIGNIFICANT -- PORTIONS OF OUR

02:41:51.401 --> 02:41:53.103
COUNTY THE REMAIN GREEN

02:41:53.170 --> 02:41:55.005

FARMLAND FOR MANY DECADES.

02:41:56.540 --> 02:41:57.774
AND THIS ABOUT A PROCESS THAT

02:41:57.841 --> 02:42:00.243
HAS NOT BEEN EASY IT'S INVOLVED --

02:42:00.310 --> 02:42:03.513
POLICIES POLITICS -- MANY

02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:05.248
ELECTIONS INITIATIVES AND

02:42:05.315 --> 02:42:07.250
OCCASIONALLY LAWSUIT WHAT WE SEE

02:42:07.317 --> 02:42:08.919
TODAY WITH THE LEGISLATION

02:42:08.985 --> 02:42:10.420
THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU.

02:42:10.487 --> 02:42:11.488
IS THE SUBTLE LANGUAGE SHOULD

02:42:11.555 --> 02:42:12.522
SETTLING WHICH THAT WOULD OPEN

02:42:12.589 --> 02:42:14.825
UP A RURAL SOLANO COUNTY TO THE

02:42:14.891 --> 02:42:16.193
POSSIBILITY.

02:42:16.259 --> 02:42:20.163
OF UNWISE -- SPRAWL TYPE

02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:21.198
DEVELOPMENTS IN ON CURRENTLY

02:42:21.264 --> 02:42:22.499
WITH ME WELL PROTECTED FARMLANDS

02:42:22.566 --> 02:42:24.301
IN SOME CASES WHAT WE'VE SEEN

02:42:24.367 --> 02:42:26.103
WITH PROJECTS IN THE COUNTY.

02:42:26.169 --> 02:42:26.670
IS THEY'VE BEEN STOPPED OR

02:42:26.736 --> 02:42:29.406
STALLED BECAUSE THE INABILITY TO

02:42:29.473 --> 02:42:31.374
DO ADEQUATE SEWAGE TREATMENT WE

02:42:31.441 --> 02:42:33.310
ALSO TIMES OF PROBLEMS WITH --

02:42:33.376 --> 02:42:34.411
PROJECTS HAVE HAD TROUBLE

02:42:34.478 --> 02:42:35.912
GETTING -- WATER THEY WANT

02:42:35.979 --> 02:42:37.848
MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLIES WE HAVE

02:42:37.914 --> 02:42:40.283
A STRONG POLICY IN SOLANO COUNTY.

02:42:40.350 --> 02:42:42.085
OF OF WHAT IS URBAN SHALL BE

02:42:42.152 --> 02:42:43.086
MUNICIPAL

02:42:43.153 --> 02:42:48.692
AND WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE

02:42:48.758 --> 02:42:50.393
SURE THAT THAT POLICY CONTINUES.

02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:52.028
THE THE LANGUAGE THAT WE

02:42:52.095 --> 02:42:53.730

02:42:55.432 --> 02:42:55.966
HAVE BEEN SENT IN BY THE EARLY

02:42:56.032 --> 02:42:56.366
GROWTH COMMITTEE.

02:42:56.433 --> 02:42:57.434
IS THAT TO AMEND THE LANGUAGE OF

02:42:57.501 --> 02:42:58.468
THAT LANDS IN THE UNINCORPORATED

02:42:58.535 --> 02:43:00.504
PART OF SOLANO COUNTY WOULD NOT

02:43:00.570 --> 02:43:02.572
BE ALLOWED TO DELIVER BIO SALAS

SOON PLAN IN TERMS OF PROCESSING

02:43:06.910 --> 02:43:08.178
IS EXCELLENT THE DOING OF

02:43:08.245 --> 02:43:10.046
THEY'RE DOING A WONDERFUL JOB OF

02:43:10.113 --> 02:43:11.781
TAKING BY ALL SOLID MATERIALS?

02:43:11.848 --> 02:43:12.916
RUNNING IT THROUGH AN ADDITIONAL

02:43:12.983 --> 02:43:15.185
PROCESSING STEP -- AND THEN

02:43:15.252 --> 02:43:16.586
HAVING HIGH QUALITY FERTILIZER

02:43:16.653 --> 02:43:17.854
THE GET SENT OUT TO THE TO THE

02:43:17.921 --> 02:43:19.556
FARMS IN OUR REGION WE WE THINK

02:43:19.623 --> 02:43:20.891
THAT'S JUST TERRIFIC.

02:43:20.957 --> 02:43:22.225
THE QUESTION BECOMES WHERE THAT

02:43:22.292 --> 02:43:23.727
MATERIAL COMES FROM.

02:43:23.793 --> 02:43:25.562
SO WE URGE YOU TODAY TO VOTE NO

02:43:25.629 --> 02:43:26.696
ON FIVE THIRTY UNLESS IT'S

02:43:26.763 --> 02:43:28.932
AMENDED CAN CAN CONSISTENT WITH.

02:43:28.999 --> 02:43:30.300
THE MEMBERS THAT WE HAVE SENT TO

02:43:32.335 --> 02:43:33.270
SHOULD PROBABLY ANNOUNCED THAT

02:43:33.336 --> 02:43:36.540
WHICH WE'LL GET TO MAINE AND

02:43:36.606 --> 02:43:41.811
WITNESSES.

02:43:41.878 --> 02:43:42.412
EITHER SIDE AND THE REST WERE

02:43:42.479 --> 02:43:43.213
JUST.

02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:45.348
IF OKAY EXPRESSIONS.

02:43:45.415 --> 02:43:46.216
GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS NOR

02:43:46.283 --> 02:43:47.684
DECIDE I REPRESENT THE SECTION

02:43:47.751 --> 02:43:49.719
OF FAIRFIELD THAT WILL BE MOST

02:43:49.786 --> 02:43:51.955
IMPACTED BY THESE CHANGES.

02:43:52.022 --> 02:43:58.195
THE ADDITION OR THE INCLUSION OF

02:43:58.261 --> 02:43:59.629
COUNTY PROPERTY.

02:43:59.696 --> 02:44:01.331
SO PROPERTIES OUTSIDE OF THE

02:44:01.398 --> 02:44:02.265
CITIES [inaudible]

02:44:02.332 --> 02:44:04.234
WILL.

02:44:04.301 --> 02:44:06.937
INCLUDE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

02:44:07.003 --> 02:44:09.039
HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS.%

02:44:09.105 --> 02:44:11.174
AND WE ARE READY SEVERELY

02:44:11.241 --> 02:44:13.009
IMPACTED.

02:44:13.076 --> 02:44:14.611
IN OUR AREA WE'VE GOT

02:44:14.678 --> 02:44:16.680
APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED

02:44:16.746 --> 02:44:17.480
HOMES.

02:44:17.547 --> 02:44:19.149
OUR CITY HAS BEEN PROLIFIC IN

02:44:19.216 --> 02:44:20.717
WORKING ON DEVELOPMENTS WHICH IS

02:44:20.784 --> 02:44:23.019
WONDERFUL THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE

02:44:23.086 --> 02:44:24.955
DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

02:44:25.021 --> 02:44:26.323
SUPPORT IT.

02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:28.658
WE'VE GOT FOUR SCHOOLS.

02:44:28.725 --> 02:44:30.827
IN OUR AREA.

02:44:30.894 --> 02:44:34.731
WHERE THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY

02:44:34.798 --> 02:44:35.265
FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED

02:44:35.332 --> 02:44:37.234
CHILDREN THE MAIN ROAD?

02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:39.202
THAT PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE

02:44:39.269 --> 02:44:42.172
SCHOOLS.

02:44:42.239 --> 02:44:44.541
IS JUST TWO LINES YOU HAVE TO

02:44:44.608 --> 02:44:46.343
COME TO A FULL STOP BEFORE YOU

02:44:46.409 --> 02:44:47.611
CAN ACCESS.

02:44:47.677 --> 02:44:49.446
THE FREEWAY.

02:44:49.512 --> 02:44:52.549
THE ROADS IN ADEQUATE TRAFFIC

02:44:52.616 --> 02:44:54.351
FLOW IS INADEQUATE.

02:44:54.417 --> 02:44:56.152
BUT THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE'VE

02:44:56.219 --> 02:44:59.055
GOT A SCHOOL DISTRICT.

02:44:59.122 --> 02:45:01.324
THAT HAS ONLY FOUR POINT FIVE

02:45:01.391 --> 02:45:04.294
MILLION DOLLARS. TO INCREASE

02:45:04.361 --> 02:45:05.362
CAPACITY [inaudible]

02:45:05.428 --> 02:45:08.164
AND WE ARE ALREADY HAVING

02:45:08.231 --> 02:45:09.933
PROBLEMS AT OUR SCHOOLS WHERE

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:11.735
THEY ARE.

02:45:11.801 --> 02:45:14.437
BEING TURNED AWAY TO OTHER.

02:45:14.504 --> 02:45:16.039
SCHOOLS IN THE DISTRICT.

02:45:16.106 --> 02:45:17.507
THE SCHOOL CANNOT INCREASE ITS

02:45:17.574 --> 02:45:20.176
CAPACITY WE'VE GOT IN OTHER

02:45:20.243 --> 02:45:22.245
PARTS OF FAIRFIELD NEAR THE NEW

02:45:22.312 --> 02:45:23.880
TRAIN STATION WHERE THERE BE

02:45:23.947 --> 02:45:25.982
APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND NEW

02:45:26.049 --> 02:45:27.350
HOMES.

02:45:27.417 --> 02:45:29.486
AND AGAIN THIS IS THE SAME

02:45:29.552 --> 02:45:31.788
SCHOOL SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE THE

02:45:31.855 --> 02:45:34.924
CAPACITY TO INCREASE.

02:45:34.991 --> 02:45:37.494
SERVICE TO ALL THESE NEW HOMES

02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:41.064
THAT ARE BEING APPROVED

02:45:41.131 --> 02:45:41.364
[inaudible]

02:45:41.431 --> 02:45:43.600
NOT ALLOWING.

02:45:43.667 --> 02:45:47.304
THE GREEN THE SKIS ME SPECIFIC

02:45:47.370 --> 02:45:50.307
MIDDLE GREEN VALLEY. TO CONNECT

02:45:50.373 --> 02:45:52.375
TO THE SEWER SYSTEM IS NOT GOING

02:45:52.442 --> 02:45:54.177
TO STOP THE PROJECT.

02:45:54.244 --> 02:45:56.746
THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND BUILD IT.

02:45:56.813 --> 02:45:58.181
THERE ARE NO SUBJECTS.

02:45:58.248 --> 02:46:00.583
SYSTEMS THAT WE USE THEY'LL

02:46:00.650 --> 02:46:02.886
BUILD THEIR OWN SEWER SYSTEM AND

02:46:02.952 --> 02:46:03.787
WHAT WE NEED.

02:46:03.853 --> 02:46:06.156
IS TIME.

02:46:06.222 --> 02:46:07.891
THERE IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR THEM

02:46:07.957 --> 02:46:10.126
TO DO THAT AND WE NEED THAT TIME

02:46:10.193 --> 02:46:11.861
BECAUSE WE ARE ALREADY IN

02:46:11.928 --> 02:46:13.630
TROUBLE.

02:46:13.697 --> 02:46:17.167
WE JUST CANNOT ACCOMMODATE.

02:46:17.233 --> 02:46:19.903
THESE ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED

02:46:19.969 --> 02:46:21.504
HOMES WITH WE JUST DON'T HAPPEN

02:46:21.571 --> 02:46:21.805
[inaudible]

02:46:21.871 --> 02:46:31.948
THE THE THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT.

02:46:32.015 --> 02:46:34.050
PEOPLE SPEND BRING THEIR

02:46:34.117 --> 02:46:35.785
CHILDREN TO SCHOOL.

02:46:35.852 --> 02:46:37.454
I HAVE A PARENT WHO DESCRIBED IT

02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:39.055
AS I COULD HAVE BEEN TO SAN

02:46:39.122 --> 02:46:41.825

02:46:41.891 --> 02:46:43.693
STUCK IN ALL THIS TRAFFIC.

02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:46.196
BECAUSE WE HAVE LIKE I SAY IN

02:46:46.262 --> 02:46:47.530
ADEQUATE COULD ROADS.

02:46:47.597 --> 02:46:50.367
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE.

02:46:50.433 --> 02:46:52.001

02:46:52.068 --> 02:46:53.203
CAPACITY AT THE SCHOOLS HOW IS

02:46:53.269 --> 02:46:54.804
IT THAT.

02:46:54.871 --> 02:46:57.407
THESE FOUR HUNDRED HOMES WHICH

02:46:57.474 --> 02:46:58.608
BY THE WAY THEY'RE NOT

02:46:58.675 --> 02:47:01.077
AFFORDABLE HOMES THE HOMES THAT

02:47:01.144 --> 02:47:02.278
THAT ARE APPROVED IN CITY.

02:47:02.345 --> 02:47:04.347
THERE ARE MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE

02:47:04.414 --> 02:47:07.684
IF YOU'RE GONNA COMPARED THEM --

02:47:07.751 --> 02:47:10.053
THIS WILL HELP VERY AFFLUENT

02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:13.590
PEOPLE. TO THE DETRIMENT OF

02:47:13.656 --> 02:47:14.891

DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDENTIAL

02:50:59.949 --> 02:51:01.784
DEVELOPMENTS THAT WOULD BE

02:51:01.851 --> 02:51:03.419
CREATING SPRAWL IN THE COUNTY SO

02:51:03.486 --> 02:51:04.854
THAT'S IN IT IT WOULD BE ON

02:51:04.921 --> 02:51:08.091
PRIME AG LAND SURROUNDING SOLANO

COUNTY IS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS

02:51:22.405 --> 02:51:24.240

02:51:30.146 --> 02:51:30.713
THE PEOPLE.

02:51:30.780 --> 02:51:32.415
AND SO WHAT MONDAY TALK ABOUT

02:51:32.482 --> 02:51:34.350
URBAN SPRAWL THE CANNOT TAKE

02:51:34.417 --> 02:51:35.918

AMENDED OR VOTED ON BY THE

02:51:37.887 --> 02:51:38.988
PUBLIC AND SO.

02:51:39.055 --> 02:51:40.857
IT DOES NOT CREATE URBAN SPRAWL

02:51:40.923 --> 02:51:42.425
THERE'S A DESIGNATED AREAS AND

02:51:42.492 --> 02:51:43.893
COUNTY THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED

02:51:43.960 --> 02:51:46.329
THAT'S ALL THAT CAN BE.

02:51:46.396 --> 02:51:47.697
DEVELOPED IN THE COUNTY.

02:51:47.764 --> 02:51:49.899
THEN THE THE OTHER -- CONCERN I

02:51:49.966 --> 02:51:54.270
HEARD WAS THAT.

02:51:54.337 --> 02:52:00.043
SOMEHOW -- THE SEWERS -- SEWER

02:52:00.109 --> 02:52:01.711
SERVICE WAS GOING -- TO AND THAT

02:52:01.778 --> 02:52:03.312
BEING BROUGHT FROM ONE AREA INTO

02:52:03.379 --> 02:52:04.681
ANOTHER AREA AND MAYBE YOU CAN

02:52:04.747 --> 02:52:06.049
EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BETTER

02:52:06.115 --> 02:52:06.983
THAN I JUST TRIED.

02:52:07.050 --> 02:52:09.318
TO ARTICULATE A CAN YOU RESTATE

02:52:09.385 --> 02:52:10.853
THAT AND SURE.

02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:12.088
A FURTHER EXPLAIN SURE DOING

02:52:12.155 --> 02:52:14.590
CRIME AGAIN SO THE THE FAIRFIELD

02:52:14.657 --> 02:52:15.391
TO SOON SEWER DISTRICT PLANT

02:52:15.458 --> 02:52:17.627
WHICH BY DEFINITION FEARFUL TO

02:52:17.694 --> 02:52:20.063
SENATE WAS BUILT TO ACCOMMODATE

02:52:20.129 --> 02:52:20.997
TO CITIES.

02:52:21.064 --> 02:52:22.799
BUT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS OR

02:52:22.865 --> 02:52:23.332
THREE YEARS GREG.

02:52:23.399 --> 02:52:24.467
THEY'VE IMPORTER THE NEW

02:52:24.534 --> 02:52:26.602
TECHNOLOGY -- CAME OUT OF CANADA

02:52:26.669 --> 02:52:27.804
THIS IS THE TO TRAFFIC

02:52:27.870 --> 02:52:29.572
TECHNOLOGY THAT RUNS -- BILE

02:52:29.639 --> 02:52:31.908
SALTS BOTH FROM THEIR PLANT AND

02:52:31.974 --> 02:52:33.076
FROM OTHER PLANTS AROUND THE BAY

02:52:33.142 --> 02:52:34.744
AREA THEIR TRUCKED INTO THE

02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:36.679
FAIRFIELD TO SOON PLANT. TO

02:52:36.746 --> 02:52:38.715
TREAT THOSE BIOSOLIDS TO IT TO A

02:52:38.781 --> 02:52:40.616
HIGHER DEGREE OF CLEANLINESS

02:52:40.683 --> 02:52:41.651
PURITY.

02:52:41.718 --> 02:52:42.852
THE BECOME A HIGHER QUALITY

02:52:42.919 --> 02:52:45.188
FERTILIZER I THINK IS PROBABLY

02:52:45.254 --> 02:52:46.723
YOU KNOW EMINEM MUCH WITH MUCH

02:52:46.789 --> 02:52:47.590
OF WHILE SOLDIERS WHO TREATMENT

02:52:47.657 --> 02:52:48.257
PLANTS.

02:52:48.324 --> 02:52:51.160
IS APPLIED LAND APPLIED ACROSS.

02:52:51.227 --> 02:52:51.861
THE STATE PROBABLY ACROSS

02:52:51.928 --> 02:52:54.330
COUNTRY HEARING AREAS TO USE AS

02:52:54.397 --> 02:52:54.997
FERTILIZER.

02:52:55.064 --> 02:52:57.266
SO THE ABILITY TO BRING IN THAT

02:52:57.333 --> 02:52:58.801
MATERIAL RIGHT NOW IT'S PROBABLY

02:52:58.868 --> 02:53:00.369
NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE EXISTING

02:53:00.436 --> 02:53:01.871
SEWER DISTRICT LEGISLATION.

02:53:01.938 --> 02:53:03.740
WERE NOT WHEN IT COMES FROM

02:53:03.806 --> 02:53:09.445
OTHER -- OUTSIDE AREAS OUTSIDE

02:53:09.512 --> 02:53:10.680
OF FAIRFIELD TO SOON.

02:53:10.747 --> 02:53:11.748
WE THINK IT'S A FINE IDEA TO

02:53:11.814 --> 02:53:12.448
BRING AND STUFF FROM.

02:53:12.515 --> 02:53:13.282
MUNICIPAL SEWAGE TREATMENT

02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:14.117
PLANTS THAT SERVE YOU

02:53:14.183 --> 02:53:17.220
INCORPORATED AN URBANIZED AREAS.

02:53:17.286 --> 02:53:20.189
IN IN THE RURAL AREAS WE'VE HAD

02:53:20.256 --> 02:53:20.757
A COUPLE OF THE PROPOSED AND

02:53:20.823 --> 02:53:22.825
SOLANO COUNTY -- SUPERVISORS

02:53:22.892 --> 02:53:24.327
BERRY AND I GO BACK AND FORTH

02:53:24.393 --> 02:53:25.795
REGULARLY ON DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.

02:53:25.862 --> 02:53:26.696
BUT THERE'S BEEN REGULAR

02:53:26.763 --> 02:53:31.200
PROPOSALS TO HAVE -- FANCIER

02:53:31.267 --> 02:53:32.268
SEPARATE TYPE SYSTEMS AFTER

02:53:32.335 --> 02:53:33.269
PUMPED OUT PACKAGE SEWAGE

02:53:33.336 --> 02:53:34.637
TREATMENT PLANTS THAT THEN THEY

02:53:34.704 --> 02:53:35.171
HAVE TO GET RID OF THEIR

02:53:35.238 --> 02:53:37.006
MATERIAL THAT THEY CAN'T BRING

02:53:37.073 --> 02:53:38.407
IT UP TO A HIGH ENOUGH QUALITY.

02:53:38.474 --> 02:53:39.609
ON SITE TO HANDLE WITH THE

02:53:39.675 --> 02:53:41.110
REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL

02:53:41.177 --> 02:53:43.312
BOARD REQUIRES SO IF THEY HAVE

02:53:43.379 --> 02:53:44.914
THE ABILITY TO DO SOMETHING OF A

02:53:44.981 --> 02:53:46.849
LOWER QUALITY TREATMENT SYSTEM

02:53:46.916 --> 02:53:47.884
ON SITE.

02:53:47.950 --> 02:53:50.119
AND THEN HOLD THE MATERIALS TO

02:53:50.186 --> 02:53:51.020
THE FAIRFIELD TO SOME PLANT.

02:53:51.087 --> 02:53:52.288
GOOD ENVIRONMENTALLY AFTER

02:53:52.355 --> 02:53:53.856
PROJECTS BEEN BUILT.

02:53:53.923 --> 02:53:55.625
BUT IF THAT ENCOURAGES AND

02:53:55.691 --> 02:53:56.759
INCENTIVIZE IS PROJECTS TO BE

02:53:56.826 --> 02:53:59.128
BUILT IN THAT PLACES WE HAVE A

02:53:59.195 --> 02:53:59.729
CONCERN THAT'S ALL OUR CONCERN

02:53:59.796 --> 02:54:00.496
IS.

02:54:00.563 --> 02:54:01.631
DON'T INCENTIVIZE THE

02:54:01.697 --> 02:54:02.899
POTENTIALITY.

02:54:02.965 --> 02:54:05.334
OF PUTTING SUBDIVISION

02:54:05.401 --> 02:54:07.870
DEVELOPMENTS ON FARM LET.

02:54:07.937 --> 02:54:09.772
AND WHAT IF I COULD GET A RISK I

02:54:09.839 --> 02:54:10.239
MIGHT OUT TONIGHT I'M

02:54:10.306 --> 02:54:11.507
CERTIFICATION THE BILL DOESN'T

02:54:11.574 --> 02:54:13.242
ADD THE PROVISIONS TO PUT IN THE

02:54:13.309 --> 02:54:14.610
SORT OF PACKAGE TREATMENT PLANTS

02:54:14.677 --> 02:54:15.878
THAT ALREADY EXISTS THOSE CAN BE

02:54:15.945 --> 02:54:16.712
DONE.

02:54:16.779 --> 02:54:18.714
REGARDLESS OF THIS BILL IF THE

02:54:18.781 --> 02:54:20.149
COUNTY APPROVED THE PROJECTS

02:54:20.216 --> 02:54:21.551
THEY CAN BUILD THESE ON SITE

02:54:21.617 --> 02:54:23.419
TREATMENT SYSTEMS AND THEY CAN.

02:54:23.486 --> 02:54:25.788
TRUCK THAT TO ANY OTHER FACILITY

02:54:25.855 --> 02:54:27.056
THIS BILL WOULD ONLY PREVENT

02:54:27.123 --> 02:54:28.691
THEM FROM TRACKING IT TO THE IT

02:54:28.758 --> 02:54:29.992
AS AMENDED BY.

02:54:30.059 --> 02:54:31.327
THE ORDERLY GROWTH PEOPLE.

02:54:31.394 --> 02:54:33.696
WOULD ONLY PROHIBIT THAT FROM

02:54:33.763 --> 02:54:34.864
COMING TO THE FAIRFIELD TOO SOON

02:54:34.931 --> 02:54:36.566
SEWER DISTRICT NOT TO THE PLANTS

02:54:36.632 --> 02:54:37.667
IN BACK OF BILL OR DELAYED OR

02:54:37.733 --> 02:54:39.802
BENICIA OR ANY OTHER PLANT

02:54:39.869 --> 02:54:41.037
THROUGHOUT SOLANO COUNTY SO THAT.

02:54:41.103 --> 02:54:45.641
THIS DOES NOT HELP THAT

02:54:45.708 --> 02:54:47.143
PARTICULAR PROVISION.

02:54:47.210 --> 02:54:48.778
OKAY -- I THANK YOU FOR THE

02:54:48.845 --> 02:54:50.146
RESPONSE I I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT

YOUR BILL I UNDERSTAND THERE'S

02:54:51.247 --> 02:54:51.948

UP ALL ACROSS THE THAT THE STATE

02:54:57.053 --> 02:55:00.590
OF CALIFORNIA -- WHEN -- FOLKS

02:55:00.656 --> 02:55:02.158
DON'T WANT TO SEE DEVELOPMENT TO

02:55:02.225 --> 02:55:05.194
HAPPEN I UNDERSTAND IT I GET IT --

02:55:05.261 --> 02:55:06.262
BUT WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A

02:55:06.329 --> 02:55:07.630
HOUSING CRISIS.

02:55:07.697 --> 02:55:10.199
AND TO WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING

02:55:10.266 --> 02:55:12.001
RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT.

02:55:12.068 --> 02:55:13.002
I DON'T SEE THAT THIS IS A

02:55:13.069 --> 02:55:14.737
RESPONSIBLE SIMPLY BECAUSE

02:55:14.804 --> 02:55:17.039
SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN -- THE

02:55:17.106 --> 02:55:18.307
OPPOSITION SEEMS VERY

02:55:18.374 --> 02:55:23.212

02:55:34.824 --> 02:55:36.626
POTENTIAL -- THE DEVICE FOR THE

02:55:36.692 --> 02:55:37.927
BUILDINGS GOOD PLANNING I THINK

02:55:37.994 --> 02:55:39.161
IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A SOMETHING

02:55:39.228 --> 02:55:42.398
THAT'S WELL GROUNDED -- IN THE

02:55:42.465 --> 02:55:43.866
ANALYSIS BUT YOU KNOW THE THINGS
