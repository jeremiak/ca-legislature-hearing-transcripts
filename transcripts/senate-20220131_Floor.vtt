00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:41.106
FOR- WEEKS NOW AND CERTAINLY

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:42.341
BELIEVE THAT WE WILL GET TO THE

00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:43.842
FINISH LINE WITH SOMETHING THAT

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.844
MAKES SENSE FOR EVERYONE

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:47.512
ESPECIALLY OUR SMALL CRAFT

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:51.516
DISTILLERIES AND- ARE CONSUMERS

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:54.286
. BUT- I ACTUALLY RAISED

00:20:54.353 --> 00:20:59.157
CONCERNS- NGO OUT WHEN THIS BILL

00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:02.327
WAS HEARD- AND OFFERED A

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:03.562
COURTESY VOTE TO KEEP THE

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:06.198
DISCUSSIONS GOING AND HAVE BEEN

00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:09.368
MONITORING THEM- AS THINGS HAVE

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:12.204
PROGRESSED YOU KNOW I- AND

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.872
CONCERN THAT THE BILL DOES NOT

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:16.074
INCLUDE COMMON CARRIER WITH

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:20.379
EMPLOYEES LANGUAGE AND I AM ALSO

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:21.613
DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT IT

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.749
CONTINUES TO HAVE- BIG

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:25.951
DISTILLERIES IN IT I KNOW THAT

00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:27.519
THEY GOT A HAIR CUT BUT WE ALSO

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:30.088
KNOW THAT LARGE. ENTITIES AND

00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:32.658
CORPORATIONS- EVEN WHEN THERE

00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:35.127
ARE CAPS THERE ARE WAYS TO WORK

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:38.163
AROUND THE CAPS IT IS JUST TRUE

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.765
AND I HAD A REALLY HEARTFELT

00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:41.266
CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR WHO

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:42.701
TALKED TO ME ABOUT THE INTENT

00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:44.903
BEHIND THIS BILL AND WHY IT IS

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.005
SO IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT SMALL

00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:50.175
CRAFT DISTILLERIES. AND WHILE

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:54.246
THE HIGH TIDE RISES ALL BOATS-

00:21:54.312 --> 00:21:55.847
IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT WHEN THAT

00:21:55.914 --> 00:21:57.749
HAPPENS YOU KNOW MOST OF THE

00:21:57.816 --> 00:22:02.287
BOUNTY GOES TO LARGER COMPANIES-

00:22:02.354 --> 00:22:04.823
AND SO I WOULD PREFER IF WE

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.559
SEPARATE THIS IN HOUSE SOMETHING

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:09.061
THAT FOCUSES ON BG CRAFT

00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:10.629
DISTILLERIES AND THEN HAVE

00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:12.230
SOMETHING THAT FOCUSES ON SMALL

00:22:12.297 --> 00:22:14.099
BUSINESSES BECAUSE SO OFTEN WE

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:17.402
SAY WE'RE DOING THIS FOR THE

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:18.403
LITTLE GUY WE'RE DOING THIS FOR

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.872
THE LITTLE GUY. AND THEN THE BIG

00:22:20.939 --> 00:22:21.540
GUYS SEE AN OPPORTUNITY AND THEY

00:22:21.606 --> 00:22:24.209
JUMP ON TO THE BANDWAGON AND

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:26.678
THEN AS A RESULT THERE ARE A LOT

00:22:26.745 --> 00:22:29.081
OF CHANGES THAT HAPPEN. TO

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:31.183
ACCOMMODATE THOSE SIZED

00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:32.851
INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:35.020
NEEDS AND DIFFERENT CHALLENGES

00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:36.955
THAN OUR SMALL MOM AND POPS THAT

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:38.523
ARE OFTENTIMES STRUGGLING TO

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.159
SURVIVE AND I SURMISE BECAUSE I

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:42.260
HAVE TALKED TO SOME OF THEM

00:22:42.327 --> 00:22:43.528
WOULD LIKE SOMETHING

00:22:43.595 --> 00:22:47.099
pI AM DISTURBED THAT WE ARE

00:22:47.165 --> 00:22:48.700
PAINTING YOU KNOW WORKERS%

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:51.036
AGAINST WORKERS AND SO THAT IS

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:53.839
ALSO WHY YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE

00:22:53.905 --> 00:22:54.840
TO SEE THIS BILL HAVE DIFFERENT

00:22:54.906 --> 00:22:56.575
LANGUAGE IN AND AROUND. COMMON

00:22:56.641 --> 00:22:58.577
CARRIER WITH EMPLOYEES AND

00:22:58.643 --> 00:23:01.213
BECAUSE I KNOW. I AM ALSO VERY

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:02.514
GRATEFUL TO HEAR THAT THE NEXT

00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:04.116
TIME WE WILL SEE IT YOU KNOW

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.788
THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT KIND OF

00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:12.491
CONSTELLATIONS AND SO IT MIGHT

00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:14.860
MAKE SENSE FOR US TO TRY TO YOU

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:17.529
KNOW ADDRESS THEM- DIFFERENTLY

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:21.333

NECESSARILY A BAD THING. I WOULD

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:06.104
STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

AND THAT THERE. ISN'T ANY A

00:30:11.943 --> 00:30:14.712

THAT NOBODY COULD SELL IF YOU

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:18.016

00:33:17.328 --> 00:33:20.331
NUMBER ONE. THE SMALL DISTILLERS

00:33:20.398 --> 00:33:23.968
DEFINITELY NEED TO BE SUPPORTED

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:25.837

AS A SOCIETY IS COMMERCE HAS

00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:41.285
MOVED TO SO SIGNIFICANTLY ONLINE

MORTAR. INFECTED DYING AND WE

00:33:47.158 --> 00:33:48.693
BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT LIKE

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.528
MANY OF OUR LAND USE POLICIES

00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:51.662
ARE BASED AROUND BRICK AND

00:33:51.729 --> 00:33:53.831
MORTAR OR SALES TAX POLICY SO

00:33:53.898 --> 00:33:56.734
MUCH. AND YET THE REALITY IS

00:33:56.801 --> 00:33:58.136
THAT THINGS ARE MOVING AWAY FROM

LOAN I THINK IS SOMEWHAT IS

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:21.092
UNFAIR BUT I AM GOING TO DO

THIS BILL STARTED OFF WITH MANY

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:46.951
DEFICIENCIES I THINK RECALL ALL

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:49.153
AGREE ON THAT AND BECAUSE OF

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.155

WITH SOME OF OUR LABOR FRIENDS

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:57.094
TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE FOCUS

00:34:57.161 --> 00:34:58.563
ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY

00:34:58.629 --> 00:35:00.631
CARED ABOUT AND I WOULD JUST SAY

00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:02.533

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:12.877
THAT I AT LEAST WHAT WAS ABLE TO

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:15.246
GET SOME OF THE LARGER ITEMS

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:16.914
THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED WITH

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:20.284
TOM AND AT NO TIME DID I HEAR NO

00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:21.786
EVERY TIME I PRESENTED SOMETHING

00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:23.054
THAT LABOR WANTED HE WOULD BE

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.490
AGREEABLE TO- UNFORTUNATE SOME

00:35:25.556 --> 00:35:27.492

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:04.335
HAVE STAINED AT THAT POINT AND I

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:07.138
HAVE TO CONFESS- I'M INCLINED TO

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:08.172
ABSTAIN IN THIS SITUATION

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.840
BECAUSE WE'RE COMBINING TWO

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:13.778
ISSUES. THAT ON THE- ON THEIR

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:15.412
MERITS SHOULD BE SEPARATED. I

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:16.947
WOULD LOVE IF THEY WOULD JUST

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:19.083
THIS BILL ON ON DISTILLERIES I

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.852
THINK IT WOULD BE A FORTY YO.

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:24.021
NOW MOVING INTO THE OTHER MORE

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:25.956
DIFFICULT THING IS HOW DO YOU

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:27.992
HOW DO WE INVOLVE THE TIER

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:31.061
SYSTEM. BECAUSE THERE SHOULD BE

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:34.331
SOME CAPACITY FOR PRODUCERS TO

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:36.767
MAIL DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. BUT

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:38.035
YOU ALSO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:40.271
BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES UPON

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:42.506
DECADES UPON DECADES IN ALL THE

00:40:42.573 --> 00:40:43.307

INVESTMENT TRANSPORTATION

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:47.878
EMPLOYEE BLOCKS. YOU CAN'T JUST

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:50.114
SIMPLY ON DO THAT OVERNIGHT AND

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:51.549
I KNOW THAT THIS BILL SOUNDS

00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:52.850
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BE ON DOING IT

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:54.618
OVERNIGHT BUT IT WILL

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:59.223
IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THAT PROCESS

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.457
OF BOTH SIDES GOING TO THEIR

00:41:00.524 --> 00:41:03.561
CORNERS IN DUKING IT OUT- THE

00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:05.563
VOLUME THAT CAN BE TRANSPORTED.

00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:07.398
THROUGH DIRECT CONSUMER SALES

00:41:07.464 --> 00:41:10.167
WHAT UNDOUBTEDLY INCREASE SORT

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:12.603
PUSHING OFF THE INEVITABLE. I

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.505
WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:15.606
OF COURSE YOU WANT TO PASS IT

00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:17.508
TODAY AND THEN- IT IT'S GOING TO

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:18.609
BE OFF TO THE RACES IN THE

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:21.145
ASSEMBLY. IF THIS WERE TO BE

00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:23.314
BIFURCATED I WOULD BE SO PROUD

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.582
TO CAST A VOTE IN FAVOR OF

00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:26.050
PROMOTING SMALL BATCH

00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:30.754
DISTILLERY- CONSUMER SALES. AND

00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:32.156
THE NEXT BATTLE WHICH WOULD

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:33.657
ESSENTIALLY BE A POLITICAL WAR

00:41:33.724 --> 00:41:36.694
WE ALL KNOW THAT. LET THE MERITS

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.730
OF THAT DEBATE UNFOLD. IN LET'S

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:40.564
GO AFTER THE TIER SYSTEM FOR

WHAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:44.235
ANTIQUATED BUT YOU CAN'T JUST ON

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:46.570
DO IT WITHOUT A HIGH DEGREE OF

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:48.405
FOR NON PREPARATION PRECAUTION.

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:50.741

ECONOMIC SENSE FOR THEM TO BE

00:45:42.306 --> 00:45:42.940
UNDERSTAND THEIR CENTRAL

00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:43.841
ARGUMENT WHICH IS THAT THEY

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:44.942

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.588
MADE DURING A VERY DIFFERENT

00:55:25.655 --> 00:55:28.558

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:29.893
POSSIBLE WHEN ALL FRONT LINE

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:32.095

00:55:41.204 --> 00:55:43.406
EXCUSES ME WE MAKE BEFORE WE DO

00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:46.009
WHAT'S RIGHT. OPPONENTS MAY

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:48.244
ARGUE THAT THE BILL ROUSSEL. IN

00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:49.279
A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

00:55:49.345 --> 00:55:50.914
FRAUDULENT CLAIM AND BANKRUPT

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:51.948
HOSPITALS THIS IS SIMPLY NOT

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:54.250

ALL PRESUMPTIONS IN THE BILL CAN

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:59.422
BE REBUTTED. EMPLOYERS HAVE THE

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:01.191
ABILITY TO DISPUTE ANY CLAIMS.

00:56:01.257 --> 00:56:03.226
SB TWO THIRTEEN EXPLICITLY

00:56:03.293 --> 00:56:04.994

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:53.810
SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS THAT DON'T

00:56:53.877 --> 00:56:54.844
WATER DOWN THE INTENT OF THE

00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:57.213

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.081
AGAIN IS LEVELING THE PLAYING

00:56:58.148 --> 00:57:01.217

RESOLVING THE ECONOMIC AND

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:05.155

FURTHER I OPENING EXPERIENCE.

00:57:12.061 --> 00:57:13.029
AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS AS A

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:14.464
COUNTY SUPERVISOR. I HAD A

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:15.398

THE BEAUTY OF THESE DISCUSSIONS

IS THAT WE FIND WAYS. TO CREATE

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:22.571
