MEMBERS AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK SOMETIMES LATE IN THE HOUR BUT WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ENOUGH MEASURE. THAT WE SHOULD MOVE IT NOW. PERCENT A BEFORE SIXTY FIVE A BILL TO BETTER PROTECT SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC. VIOLENCE FROM GUN VIOLENCE. AB FOR SIXTY FIVE WOULD CODIFY TO EXISTING CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT THAT ESTABLISHES ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT PROCESS. RECORDS TO ENSURE THAT FIREARM RELINQUISHMENT IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER CASES ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE I WOULD MAKE THIS PROCESS CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. BUT ALSO A LINE THE CIVIL RULES LANGUAGE WITH A CRIMINAL RULE WHICH MEANT MANDEECEES PROCESSES ARE REQUIRED. AT THEY'RE IN EXPEDITED TIMELINE. IN CALIFORNIA 33% OF WOMEN AND 20% OF MEN EXPERIENCE SOME FORM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DURING THEIR LIFETIMES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATED CALLS FOR ASSISTANCE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OVER 45% OF THESE CALLS REPORTS SOME KIND OF WEAPON BEING INVOLVED IN THE ABUSE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE PRESENT FIREARM IN THE HOME DURING AN INCIDENT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCREASES THE RISK OF HOMICIDE BY AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT. IN FACT OVER HALF OF THE FEMALE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOMICIDE IN UNITED STATES. ARE KILLED WITH A FIREARM. EVERY MONTH THE NUMBER FIFTY TWO WOMEN ARE SHOT AND KILLED UNITED STATES BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER. IN NEARLY ONE MILLION. WOMEN TODAY ARE ALIVE WHO HAVE BEEN SHOT AT WERE SHOT. SHOT OR SHOT AT BY A TO AN INTIMATE PARTNER EVEN WITH OUR STATES ROBUST FIREARM LEGISLATION THEY'RE STILL OVER TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FARM TO PROHIBIT A PERSON TO HAVE FAILED TO RELINQUISH THEIR WEAPONS. OF THOSE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HAVE BECOME A PROHIBITIVE PERSON TO A RESTRAINING ORDER. SO UNDER EXISTING LAW WHEN A PERSON BECOMES HAS A RESTRAINING ORDER PUT IT UP ON THEM FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THEY AUTOMATICALLY ARE SUPPOSED TO RELINQUISH THEIR FIREARMS. WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF THAT BEING HAPPEN TO RULES OF COURT THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO AT. THERE'S NO LIMIT IN OFTENTIMES IS INCONSISTENT TO ONE SUMMER. AND BACK BEFORE THE JUDGE THEY SEVEN GET THEIR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER THANK THEN COME BACK THE SEE THE JUDGE THE JUDGES AND OFTEN ASK HAVE YOU RELINQUISH YOUR FIREARMS DO YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF PROOF OF THAT OR ARE YOU STILL. HOLDING OUT NOW ALL OF THEM THE WOMAN IS GOING TO COME TO THE COURT WITH THAT THAT THAT SAID ABUSER AND MAY NOT EVEN HAVE AN ATTORNEY PRESENT I BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF TIMES AND CIVIL COURTS FAMILY COURT. DO YOU GO WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ASK THE JUDGE TO ASK QUESTIONS. AND SO OFTEN. AND WHO ARE LEFT OUT AN ATTORNEY WITH SOMEBODY SPEAK FOR THEM WITHOUT NO RIGHT. TO ASK. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. QUESTION YOU NEED. HAS REALLY WHICH THEIR FIRE ARMS AS THEY ARE ALREADY BOUND TO DO UNDER LAW. THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION THE GIFFORDS LAWSON TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE THE PARTNER THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. AS YOU KNOW THERE WAS JUST RECENTLY IT LOCALLY IT WAS SOMEBODY WHO HAD SUPPOSED TO HAVE GIVEN UP THEIR WEAPONS A WOMAN CALLED AT TO SAY I NEED HELP GETTING OUT OF MY HOUSE WHEN THE POLICE OFFICER SHOWED UP. THAT ABUSER OPENED FIRE AND SHOT AND KILLED AN OFFICER SO THIS IS NOT ONLY TO KEEP VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SAFE BUT ALSO OUR FIRST RESPONDERS WHO HAVE TO OFTENTIMES GO OUT ON THE CALLS. AND YOU KNOW A SOCIAL THE BODY ALSO MIGHT SHOW UP I KNOW THAT IF SOMEBODY HAS A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST THEM AND THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN CHARGE OF A POSSESSION. OF IT. WITH HERE TO ANSWER SHINJI. LOS IN CAP PART. OF LEGAL SERVICES AT WE'VE WHO HELPS TO REPRESENT. IN COURT AT NO COST. THE BILL. I'M BILLS BEEN MOVED THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR DISCUSSION BY OUR. WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES AS WELL OUR STORY FOR DOWN THAT'S A GOOD POINT. ALL RIGHT LET'S JUST DOUBLE FOR FIRST. SKINNER HAVING BEEN TO FOR SO LONG I'M ACTUALLY HEAR MORE LACKEY. PRESIDENT BRADFORD. JACKSON MITCHELL MITCHELL WIENER. RIGHT WILL RETURN TOWARDS GOOD PROCESS THAT WE DO IN CASE YOU MAY STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR SUPPORT AND THEN WE CAN SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE IS HERE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU I MY NAME IS ALLISON CAP PART IN THE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL SERVICES WITH WE'VE- I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE ABOUT THE PROCESS. NOW ARE THERE ANY PEOPLE HERE IN SUPPORT. YOUR MEMBERS JONATHON FELDMAN CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT GREAT ANY OTHERS OR IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. SURE. WELL I THINK THEY CAN. YEAH. OKAY THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING IN THE LIVING ROOM ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE REGRETFULLY IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL THE SIGNIFICANCE OF REALLY QUICK RELINQUISHING WEAPONS UPON THE ISSUANCE OF DVR ROSE AND CRIMINAL PROTECTIVE ORDERS CANNOT BE OVERSTATED AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL RECOGNIZES THAT SWIFT ACTION IS IMPERATIVE THE COUNCIL ALSO RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT REPRESENT UNNECESSARILY AN UNREASONABLY IMPACTED WILL RESTRAINING ORDERS ARE REQUESTED. AB FOR SIXTY FIVE NEEDS MORE WORK THE PROCEDURES IN THE BILL DO FAR MORE THAN CODIFY TO RULES OF COURT AND INSTEAD THEY APPEAR ALTHOUGH IT IT'S SOMEWHAT UNCLEAR. TO SUBSTITUTE OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURES AND PUT THEM INTO FAMILY LAW. AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THAT IN THE CRIMINAL UNIVERSE DEFENDANTS ARE REPRESENTED THEY HAVE COUNSEL THERE IS LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENT. IN THE FAMILY LAW AS- AS OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIGHTLY POINTED OUT PEOPLE MAY NOT BE REPRESENTED WHICH MEANS THAT THERE ARE PROCEDURES THAT NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE FOR THE COURTS. TO ADVISE AND GUIDE TO PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS OF PROTECTING THEMSELVES THE BILL HAS THE RIGHT HEART WE JUST WANT TO BE THE COURTS WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE TO HELP THE PROCEDURES WORK SO WE KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT WE CAN DO. AND WHAT IS THAT WE CANNOT DO. WE FEEL THAT THE BILL IS. AMBIGUOUS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE COURTS ARE BEING ASKED TO DO. MAKING FINDINGS IN THE NEGATIVE FOR EXAMPLE IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE LANGUAGE WOULD SUGGEST. HOW FAMILY COURTS THAT DON'T HAVE THESE COMMON RELATIONSHIPS ARE SUPPOSED TO COMMUNICATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. HOW THE COURTS WILL REVAMP OUR RULES ARE FORMS ARE CALENDARING OUR PERSONNEL AND OUR TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GOOD TO GO WHEN THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE GOES INTO PLACE. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON THIS WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO BE A PARTNER WITH THE AUTHOR AS THIS MOVES FORWARD. BUT WE FEEL THAT UNFORTUNATELY IN ITS CURRENT FORM IT SHOULD NOT GO FORWARD AND WE MUST REGRETFULLY OPPOSE. HELLO BEFORE WE HEAR FROM THE NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT. SOME OF YOUR AND- CONCERNS ARE RELATED TO THE FAMILY COURT PROCESS WHICH IS PART OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHERE THIS BILL WILL GO NEXT AND WHAT OUR OUR. MAY HER VIEW IT IS IN THE CRIMINAL SIDE IN THIS DOES NOT. CHANGE THE CRIMINAL CODE PART OF THIS SO YOUR AND NOT TO DISCOUNT THE CONCERNS BUT WHAT'S RELEVANT TO US IS THE CRIMINAL SIDE SO JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT IN THE RECORD AND NOW WE WILL. HEAR FROM OUR NEXT WEEK. RIGHT OVER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION AND IT'S ALSO AND REGRET FOR OPPOSITION TO AB FOR SIXTY FIVE AND WE ALIGN A LOT OF OUR COMMENTS WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SO I WON'T GO BACK INTO THOSE CONCERNS. BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT. YES OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE RELINQUISHMENT OF FIREARMS BY RESTRAIN PERSONS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY IN THE COURTS TO PLAY A ROLE IN THAT. HOWEVER AB FOR SIXTY FIVE AS WRITTEN EITHER HAS TOO MANY TEETH BECAUSE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS ENVIRONMENT AND DUE PROCESS CONCERNS OR NOT ENOUGH TEETH BECAUSE IT IS NO BENCH WARRANTS NO EXPLICIT CONTENT AND NO DUTY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE. BECAUSE THE LAST MINUTE CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL MANY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED BUT NO ANSWERS PROVIDED. AND CJ AND FOR THESE REASONS CJ RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND NO VOTES THAT WE CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS ON THIS IN THE FALL TO SEE HOW THE COURTS CAN WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE FIREARMS ARE REMOVED. YOU. THOSE CONCERNS PRIMARILY AROUND THE PORTION OF THE BILL THAT. IS WRITTEN THAT AFFECTS THE TO DISTORT THE PAINT NOT THE WELL THE JUDICIAL CODE VERSUS THE PENAL CODE. I THINK THERE IT'S A HEIGHTENED AND THE FAMILY CODE SECTION OF THIS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT BECAUSE- THERE'S USUALLY IS COUNSEL ON THE CRIMINAL SIDE AND THE DEFENDANT IS ALREADY SOMETIMES AND THE BECAUSE CITY SO THE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS OUR ALLEVIATE SLIGHTLY FOR THE CRIMINAL SIDE BUT WE STILL THINK THERE ARE SOME IMPLICATIONS. WHICH I OUTLINED IN A LETTER. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OFFICE. OKAY GIVEN THAT SOME PEOPLE CAME IN LATE WERE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT BEFORE WE OPEN THE DÃ­AS FOR DISCUSSION. OKAY LET'S SEE DISCUSSION MOVES SENATOR. THANK YOU YOU MAY REMEMBER I TH I THINK THE TERM GUT AND AMEND THIS GUY IS HAS UP IN FOR NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS I DON'T WANT TO USE THAT TERM BUT CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THIS BILL IS BEFORE ME. I'LL FRAME IT THAT WAY. AS OPPOSED TO NEXT YEAR. CERTAINLY BUT- YEAH AND I AND I DON'T THINK ANY WE LIKE TO TERM LIMITS. I AM NOT I AM NOT. A FAN OR ONE WHO USES THEM MUCH. HOWEVER IN LIGHT IT FEELS TO ME OF THE URGENCY THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE AROUND THE STATE AND THE NATION. AND WE PULL TOGETHER A COALITION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WORK WITH MY DE A DOMESTIC THAT VIOLENCE ORGANIZATIONS. GOT ORGANIZATIONS AND THOUGHT HOW CAN HOW CAN WE- FIVE THREAD THIS NEEDLE NOW I WILL SHARE WITH YOU SENATOR AND SENATORS. LAST WEEK AHEAD. THE STOCK AND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT A BLOCK AND A HALF FROM A AND IS SIDE SCHOOL VERY POOR SOULS WHO ARE NOT ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC. A WOMAN HAD INVITED A FRIEND TO COME AND STAY WITH HER WAS AFRAID FOR HER LIFE FROM HER SPOUSE. WHEN THEY LEFT THAT MORNING TO GO TO SCHOOL. FRONT YARD I'M OF THE FIREARM AND BEGAN FIRING AT THEM. THEY WERE ABLE TO GET BACK INTO THE HOUSE. AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOWED UP AND THAT INDIVIDUAL IS NOW TO SEIZE WAS TURNED THE GUN ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THAT TIME. THAT ENTIRE SCHOOL HAD TO GO ON LOCKDOWN. TALK LINKED WITH THE TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS AFTERWARDS ABOUT THE HORROR THAT IS THAT WAS ONE OF THEIR TEACHERS ALSO THAT WAS IN THE HOUSE. AND SO JUST THE COMPOUNDING OF THAT ESPECIALLY IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS I JUST FEEL LIKE WE DIDN'T HAVE A YEAR TO WAIT. A AND WE HAVE A TOOL THAT WE CAN PUT INTO EFFECT AND I AM I AM. I KNOWLEDGE THAT WE MAY HAVE MORE WORK TO DO AND I'M WILLING TO DO WORK ON SOME CLEAN UP THINGS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. BUT I THINK WITH THE HEIGHTENED. SENSE THAT WE ALL HAVE THAT GUNS ARE GETTING OUT OF CONTROL AND THAT WE KNOW FACTUALLY THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES AND HAVE WEAPONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE THEM. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT FOR A YEAR. I CAN I GET THAT FULLY APPRECIATE. THAT RESPECT THAT I AM. IN THREE BY. THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT AROUND KIND OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE RULES AND EXPERIENCES IN THE TWO COURTS. AND IF THE BILL. GOALS FAR ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT IN NON CRIMINAL COURT SEAT SETTINGS WHERE THERE ISN'T ALWAYS REPRESENTATION THAT WHAT YOUR INTENT REALLY HAPPEN. YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THAT THE VIDEO. SHORT THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION I THINK THE I THINK THE WAY IN THIS DOES LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE AT THE CIVIL CODES AND PARTICIPANT PROTECTION WHICH I RECOGNIZE IS A LITTLE MORE UNDER THE PURVIEW OF. OUR NEXT COMMITTEE BUT I BELIEVE IN THAT PARTICULAR ROUND THAT'S AROUND THAT I HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCE IN FAMILY COURT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN FACT THAT THERE ARE OFTEN ARE NOT ATTORNEYS ON EITHER. SIDE THE ONLY NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT TYPICALLY INVOLVED. ONLY INDIVIDUAL IN THAT ARENA WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE RELINQUISHMENT ARE HAPPENING AT THE FOLLOW UP ON THIS IS THE JUDICIAL OFFICER AT THAT HEARING. THAT CASE. THANK YOU OKAY OTHER AT CENTER JACKSON YES AND I APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE DEFINITE DISTINCTIONS TO BE DRAWN HERE AND SO WE'LL BE HEARING THAT BILL IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THIS AFTERNOON. AND I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE AND WHICH IS TO OTHER. GUNMEN I MEAN OTHER BILLS I WAS. HEARING JUST BEFORE COMING TO THIS I WOULD APPRECIATE. THOUGH THE GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY ON WHAT EXACTLY YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO SORT OF WALK A TIGHTROPE BETWEEN THE CRIMINAL. REQUIREMENTS AND THE FAMILY LAW REQUIREMENTS MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THESE A LITTLE TIGHTER THAN THE FAMILY DOG BUT NOT QUITE. AS THEY ARE IN THE CRIMINAL COURTS. OF OR THE CRIMINAL PROCESS I SHOULD SAY AND THEN. IF THE OPPOSITION COULD. ARTICULATE PERHAPS AGAIN APOLOGIZE WHAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS CONCERNS ARE BUT PRACTICALLY SPEAKING HOW HOW WE GONNA DO THIS YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT IN A CRIMINAL COURT PROCEEDING. SO DO YOU HAVE TO GIVE NOTICE AND THE RIGHT TO GET COUNCIL OF OR NOT. HOW YOU CAN IMPLEMENT THIS I KNOW IT'S A NEW CRIME. TO VIOLATE THIS AND I'M WONDERING WHAT THE FAMILY LAW EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN AND WHY WE'RE SORT OF TRYING TO CREATE THIS HYBRID. SO FAR AGAIN FROM THE FAMILY A PERSPECTIVE THAT WE'RE NOT AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THIS BILL IS NOT CHANGING THE RELINQUISHMENT REQUIREMENT THAT ALREADY EXISTS SO THEY'RE ALREADY EXIST AB SECTION IN THE FAMILY CODE THAT REQUIRES ANYONE WHO IS SUBJECT TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER. TO RELINQUISH THEIR FIREARMS UPON BEING GIVEN NOTICE OF THAT ORDER AND THAT INCLUDES TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE ORDERS THAT ARE ISSUED OFTENTIMES AND AN EX PARTY YES WITH THE COURT. THEY THE REQUIREMENT TO. RELINQUISH MEN'S GOD DOESN'T COME IT DOES IS IT TRIGGERED HE IS A LOADED WORD. INTEL THE RESTRAINT PERSON IS SERVED WITH A COPY OF THE RESTRAINING ORDER AND AT THAT POINT THEY HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO RELINQUISH THEIR FIREARMS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR LICENSED GUN DEALER. AND FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION TO THE FAMILY COURT THAT THEY'VE DONE SO THERE'S THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL FORM TO DO IT AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE A RECEIPT THAT SHOWS THE TODAY. THE REALITY IS BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT OFTEN TIMES. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT OFTENTIMES INVOLVED OTHER THAN PERHAPS TO SERVE THE RESTRAINING ORDER AND THERE ARE NOT ATTORNEYS INVOLVED AT THAT POINT IN TIME THE REALITY IS THAT THESE RESTRAINT PARTIES ARE NOT RELINQUISHING THEIR WEAPONS. WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE THEY FEEL. THEY DON'T NEED TO BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T READ THE RESTRAINING ORDER. OR WHATEVER CENTERPOINT SO. THE FAMILY LAW CONTACT WHEN A WHEN THE TWO PARTIES COME TO THE FIRST NOTICED HEARING WHICH IS NOTICED BY SERVING THE TEMPORARY WATER. THAT IS THE PLACE THAT WE'D LIKE TO HAVE THE JUDICIAL OFFICER. MAKING AND DO AN ANALYSIS OF HAS THE COURT RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT. THE RESTRAINT PARTY DOES POSSESS A FIREARM OR HAS ACCESS AND CONTROL OVER A FIREARM AND HAD THEY COMPLIED WITH THE RELINQUISHMENT REQUIREMENTS AND WE'RE ASKING THAT THAT HAPPENED REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE A RESTRAINED PARTY UP HERE AND ASK FOR A CONTINUANCE TO GET COUNCIL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. NO PROBLEM THERE BUT WE ARE ASKING THAT THE JUDICIAL% OFFICER AT THAT POINT MAKE THAT DRAMATIC REGARDLESS WHETHER CASES COULD TAKE BACK LATER. EXACTLY. TO THE BRIDGE SO IS OPPOSE BECAUSE. THANK YOU BECAUSE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE UNDERSTAND FULLY THE PROCEDURES WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE COURTS WOULD HAVE QUALITY INFORMATION TO MAKE A FINDING IN FAMILY COURT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE. LARGELY ON REPRESENTED WE DON'T KNOW WHAT INFORMATION WOULD BE AVAILABLE UPON WHICH COURTS COULD MAKE A REASONABLE FINDING ONE WAY OR AND OTHER THAT WOULD ACTUALLY RESULT IN THE RELINQUISHMENT THE PROCEDURES FOR RELINQUISHMENT ALREADY EXIST BUT THEY WERE HARD UP FOUGHT TO GET TO WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR I'M MAKING SURE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROCEDURES ARE WITH THE KIDS CAN DO WHAT THE LIMITS OF THE COURTS CAN DO. MAKING FINDINGS BECAUSE SOMEBODY. WAS IN COURT AND SAYS THEY'RE IN DANGER. MAY NOT RESULT IN A FINDING THAT THEIR FIRE ARMS WHEN IN FACT THERE ARE FIREARMS IN THE HOUSE WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT THE COURTS HAVE FAILED THAT PERSON AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A TERRIBLE SITUATION. SO SIMPLY WE JUST WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE AND WORK IT OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT THE COURTS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY CAN DO AND WHAT WE CAN. BE HELPFUL IN. I THINK WE CAN. FOLLOW UP IN THIS IN THE IN THE FAMILY LAW ARENA I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. NOT TO BELABOR IT BUT- IF YOU. MAY THIS INTO YOUR BILL AND THEN PUT AN URGENCY CLAWS ON IT AND IN JANUARY WE GET IT PASSED AFTER YOU'VE COLLABORATED THEN IT COULD BE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR BE EFFECTIVE FOUR MONTHS FROM NOW. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A WHOLE YEAR LATER ACT I'M I'M WONDERING WHY. THAT ROUTE ISN'T BEING TAKEN. THIS IS OUR FIRST COMMITTEE. IS OUR FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING AND WHILE WE ALWAYS INTENDED TO TAKE IT ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE FINISH LINE WE KNOW SOMETIMES HAVE TIME IS CALLED. SO WE ARE OUR INTENTION IS TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD WE THINK THERE'S URGENCY INVOLVED WITH IT BECAUSE NO MATTER THE COURT. THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM IS STILL WE CAN STILL KILL RIGHT AND THEY ARE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN RELINQUISHED. WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN DO SOME CLEAN UP LANGUAGE LATER IF WE NEED TO BUT CERTAINLY WOULD BE A TO THE COMMITTEES PROCESS THAT WE WOULD DECIDE IF WE'RE GOING TO GO. ALL THE WAY RIGHT NOW OR IF WE'RE GONNA PAUSE UNTIL JANUARY. TO WRITE HIS BILL. AND BUT IT'S A LAST WEEK A SESSION THANK GOD. YEAH I UNDERSTAND. OKAY AND. AND YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HELP. YOU KNOW MAKE IT RIGHT THE FIRST. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME CENTER MORE LIKE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. RIGHT ON. APPRECIATE JUDICIAL COUNCILS CONCERNS FROM THE CRIMINAL SIDE. THE BILL AS WRITTEN DOES NOT DISTURB OUR PROCESS SEES THAT MAYBE THAT'S INACCURATE WORRIED BUT WHATEVER IT IS AND SO I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. AND IT IS TRUE SOMETIMES THAT RUSHING THINGS CAN BE. WHATEVER BUT WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIX AND I KNOW THAT THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE WILL BE VERY. JUDICIOUS BECAUSE I KNOW THE CHAIR AND I KNOW THEY'LL BE CAREFUL ABOUT REVIEWING IT. I'M JUST STRUCK BY. THE NUMBERS THE PERCENT OF WOMEN WHO WERE MURDERED IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR STATE. AS A RESULT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT YOU'RE MOST LIKE. AS A WOMAN. I'M RARELY GOOD I'M NOT GONNA BE MURDERED EXCEPT BY THE INTERNET PARTNER THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT THE STATS SHOW. THE OTHER AND THIS MAY BE WHY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS IN SUPPORT. THE RECORDS SHOW THAT AT MINIMUM THERE ARE FIVE SWORN OFFICERS KILLED IN A- WHEN THEY INTERVENE IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DISPUTE SO OUR OWN PEACE OFFICERS IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS SITUATIONS THAT DAY WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT. THE TYPE OF. EVERY TIME A SWORN OFFICER PUTS THEIR UNIFORM ON STEPS OUT THE DOOR THAT THEY'RE TAKING THEIR LIFE IN THEIR HANDS. AND HALF PERCENTAGE GOES UPS HOW MUCH HIGHER WHEN THEY ARE INTERVENING IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DISPUTE. AND THERE'S ALSO A VERY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE ABUSERS ARE PERPETRATORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND OTHER VIOLENT CRIME. SO I AM VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF TRYING TO. BETTER OUR RELINQUISHMENT OR OBTAINING THOSE WEAPONS FROM THE DOMESTIC ABUSER AS POSSIBLE SO FOR THAT REASON I'M WILLING TO MOVE IT ON NOW AND. WE WILL SEE HOW THE G. JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HANDLES IT. ALRIGHT LET'S TO ROLL CALL. THE. MOTION OF I'M SORRY WE HAD A MOTION HAS LOST MITCHELL. OR OKAY YOU'RE RIGHT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE. THEN I'LL TAKE YOUR MOTIONS YOU MAKE OKAY USUALLY DID MAKE THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT YOU MADE THE MOTION OKAY. ALL RIGHT GO FOR IT MOTIONS TO PASS TO DIGEST. SKINNER ALL RIGHT SKINNER I'M MORE LACKEY. THAT THIS COMMITTEE PUBLIC SAFETY WILL BE A JERK THANK YOU. MAYBE FOR THE YEAR
