GOOD MORNING. WARNING OR. SANDOR STERN WAS WAS OUT LATE. CELEBRATING HIS RECEIVING THE TECHNET LEGISLATOR OF THE YEAR AWARD. LAST NIGHT SO CONGRATULATIONS SIR. YEAH. I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYONE TO TODAY'S JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING AND THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS AND CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. ON THE TOPIC OF CYBERSECURITY IN CALIFORNIA LAW ACTIONS. I DON'T THINK EVERYONE WHO IS HE. OUR YEAH. I DON'T THINK EVERYONE WHO IS HERE TO PARTICIPATE IN HEARING INCLUDING THE WITNESSES WHO TRAVELED FROM AROUND THE STATE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY TO BE HERE TODAY. I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARC BERMAN THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE. AND I'M HAPPY TO BE JOINED BY MY CO CHAIR FOR TODAY'S HEARING CENTER AND WE STERN THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE ELECTIONS IN CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS COMMITTEE. SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ELECTIONS THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASED FOCUS ON ELECTION SECURITY NON THE INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED THREATS POSED TO OUR ELECTION SYSTEMS. A LARGE PART OF THAT INCREASE FOCUS IS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE WELL DOCUMENTED EFFORTS THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT UNDERTOOK IN AN ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THOSE EFFORTS REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION BY THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT OVER PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO INTERFERE WITH OUR NATION'S ELECTIONS. AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS WARNED THAT RUSSIA AND BULLDOG EMBOLDENED BY THE LACK OF A STRONG RESPONSE BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO ITS INTERFERENCE IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ELECTION. IS CONTINUING TO INTERFERE WITH U. S. ELECTIONS THIS YEAR. HEARING CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE RECEIVED CONFLICTING AND CONFUSING INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER OUR ELECTIONS RELATED SYSTEMS WERE THE TARGET OF RUSSIAN ATTACKS. TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND WELL IT APPEARS THAT RUSSIAN OPERATIVES MAY HAVE TRIED TO TEST THE SECURITY OF SOME STATE WEBSITES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OUR SECRETARY OF STATE. WHO WE WILL HEAR FROM SHORTLY ASSURES US THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS RELATED SYSTEMS WERE BREACHED IN ANY WAY? WHILE RUSSIA'S ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE ELECTIONS HAVE RECEIVED A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLIC ATTENTION THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY SOURCE OF POTENTIAL CYBER ATTACKS WERE ELECTIONS INFRASTRUCTURE. AND TODAY'S HEARING IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A FORM FOR EVALUATING WHETHER RUSHES EFFORTS HAD ANY EFFECT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. INSTEAD IT THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS TO HAVE A MORE FORMAL DISCUSSION ABOUT ELECTION SECURITY IN ORDER TO HELP PROMOTE A THOUGHTFUL AND FACTUAL ASSESSMENT. OF HOW CALIFORNIA CAN DEAL WITH THE EVOLVING THREATS TO OUR ELECTION SYSTEM. PART OF THAT DISCUSSION WILL INVOLVE AN EXAMINATION OF CURRENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS IN PLACE TO COMBAT THREATS TO ELECTION INTEGRITY. FOR EXAMPLE WHILE FOURTEEN STATES STILL USE PAPERLESS VOTING SYSTEMS ALLEY SOME JURISDICTIONS CALIFORNIA'S* PROHIBITED THE USE OF SUCH SYSTEMS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. SIMILARLY CALIFORNIA HAS LONG STANDING PROHIBITIONS AGAINST VOTING SYSTEMS BEING CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. HAVING WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES OR OTHERWISE CONNECTING TO PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS IN ORDER TO PROTECT AGAINST REMOTE ATTACKS TO THOSE SYSTEMS. IN FACT CALIFORNIA EVEN HAS ITS OWN VOTING SYSTEM TESTING AND CERTIFICATION STANDARDS THAT EXCEED THE VOLUNTARY STANDARDS DEVELOPED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS A MUNIFICENT WITH THREATS AND SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS WILL REQUIRE PROACTIVE EFFORTS BY FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND OFFICIALS. SOME OF THOSE EFFORTS ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY INCLUDING A ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNOR OF STE. OF STATE FUNDING TO REPLACE OUTDATED VOTING EQUIPMENT ACROSS THE STATE. AND I'M HOPING THAT TODAY'S HEARING WILL HELP US DETERMINE OTHER STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. IN PUTTING TOGETHER THE AGENDA FOR TODAY'S HEARING IN THE PRIMARY FOCUS WAS ON THREATS TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE. IN OTHER WORDS TODAY'S HEARING WON'T BE TOO HEAVILY FOCUSED ON SOCIAL MEDIA PROPAGANDA THAT'S DESIGNED TO HELP ONE CANDID IT OR HURT ANOTHER. THAT MAY BE A TOPIC FOR A FUTURE HERE. BUT THE TWO ISSUES ARE NOT COMPLETELY SEVER ONES AND I EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT THE THREAT OF. ABOUT THE THREAT TO PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN OUR DEMOCRACY WHEN VOTERS RECEIVE MISLEADING OR INACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF ELECTION RESULTS. WE HAVE A VERY DISTINGUISHED GROUP OF PARTICIPANTS FOR TODAY'S HEARING. AND AFTER WE HEAR FROM THE WITNESSES ON THE AGENDA WILL HAVE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT FROM THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE. AND ANYBODY WISHING TO TESTIFY DURING THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY PORTION OF THE AGENDA SHOULD SIGN UP WITH THE SERGEANT AT ARMS. RIGHT OVER THERE. BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THE WITNESS IS ON THE AGENDA A LIKE TO INVITE MY CULTURE FOR TODAY'S HEARING SENATOR HENRY STERN TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. PLEASE DO THE JOINT HEARING WITH YOU TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INITIATIVE IN BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TIME TO ASSURE THE VOTERS A CALIFORNIA. THAT. STRONG THIS WAY THEY CAN COME BACK RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IS TO GO OUT AND VOTE. THE REGISTER TO VOTE EARLY. AND TO VOTE AND OUR SYSTEMS. AS WE'VE SEEN THROUGH THE DILIGENCE OF OUR SECRETARY OF STATE. AND OUR NUMEROUS COUNTY REGISTRARS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE PRETTY GOOD CYCLE. COMPARE TO THE REST THIS COUNTRY. SOME OF IT WAS BECAUSE OF. REAL LEADERSHIP. IT IN IN OUR SYSTEMS AND AND VIGILANCE AND A AND A SORT OF. A WILLINGNESS TO MODERNIZE BUT SOME OF IT IS LOW TECH SOME OF IT ISABOUT OUR WILLINGNESS IS A STATE. TO. DISCONNECT FROM THE INTERNET AND TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR VOTING SYSTEMS IN FACT. OUR ON SITE CURE WITH PAPER TRAILS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY AUDIT. AND INTERESTINGLY THAT THAT ACTUALLY IS BROUGHT SOME MODICUM OF OF SECURITY INTEREST I THINK BACK TO THE CALIFORNIA ELECTORATE. BUT OF COURSE IT'S OUR DUTY HERE IN THE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO KICK THE TIRES AND I THINK. DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS SYSTEMS GET ALL. AND ITS EQUIPMENT GETS OLD AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW IS HOW TO SORT OF ADAPT THAT HARD INFRASTRUCTURE. INTO THE MODERN ERA. BEYOND SAY WINDOWS TWO THOUSAND. INTO. THE TWENTY. TWENTIES. AND AND BEYOND THAT I THINK WE'LL HEAR A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT TODAY. BUT I WANTED TO SEND THAT NOTE EARLY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DISTRUST OUT THERE AND AND AGAIN ACKNOWLEDGING WHAT WE PROBABLY CANNOT SOLVE TODAY WHICH IS THE SOFT INFRASTRUCTURE. SPEECH. AND OF ART SHOULD HAVE DEMOCRATIC CONVERSATION WHICH REALLY CAN'T BE PINNED DOWN IN ANY PARTICULAR MEDIUM. IT'S OBVIOUSLY ON FACEBOOK IT'S SO ON YOUR TWITTER ACCOUNTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION MOVING A LOT OF QUESTIONS I'M SURE PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THE DURABILITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY IN LIGHT OF ALL THIS CHEAP SPEECH AND OFTEN FAKE SPEECH. BUT TODAY. WE'RE HERE TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BONES OF CALIFORNIA'S DEMOCRACY ARE STRONG SO. WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE CHAIR. AND AND GET INTO IT. THANK YOU SENATOR. AND BEFORE HEAR FROM SECRETARY PADILLA WHAT ANY OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT LET'S GET STARTED ON OUR AGENDA LEADING US OFF TODAY WILL BE OUR SECRETARY OF STATE. ALEX PADILLA. THE SECRETARY OBVIOUSLY NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION TO THE MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITTEES BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT AS A SENATOR SECRETARY PADILLA AUTHORED THE BILL THAT LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT VOTING SYSTEM TESTING. AND CERTIFICATION STANDARDS. DURING HIS TIME AS SECRETARY OF STATE SECRETARY PATILLAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR MODERNIZING THE OFFICE INCREASING VOTER REGISTRATION AND PARTICIPATION AND STRENGTHENING VOTING RIGHTS. SECRETARY VIDEO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. THANKYOU VERY MUCH A POUND CHAIRMAN BERMAN CHAIRMAN STERN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND FOR ORGANIZING THIS IMPORTANT. AND OF SHE VERY TIMELY A HEARING THE TIMING COULDN'T BE ANY MORE APPROPRIATE. ALSO TO COMMITTEE FOR PUTTING A GREAT LINEUP OF SPEAKERS TOGETHER OF COURSE VIA. A BRITISH TOWARDS VOTERS THAT ARE HERE FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA OF OUR PARTNERS THAT WE WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY. BECAUSE ELECTIONS ARE CONDUCTED AT THE GROUND LEVEL AND THERE ARE THERE ON THE FRONT LINES BUT IT'S TREMENDOUS PARTNERSHIP. THE OF ENJOYED BUT JUST AND ADMINISTERING SAFE AND SECURE ELECTIONS IN MODERNIZING FOR THE FUTURE. BUT REALLY I OUGHT TO IT TOTO MAXIMIZE THE CYBERSECURITY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ELECTIONS. A AND BEYOND IN OF ALL WANT TO GIVE VOTE WORK CALIFORNIA WELCOME TO COMMISSIONER MASTERSON FROM THE EAC. A WHO'S BEEN A. BUT A TREMENDOUS LEADER. TRULY PROFESSIONAL AND SEVEN WHO HAS RALLIED EXPERTS ACROSS THE BOARD BOTH IN THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES. ARE ON A NATIONAL LEVEL SO I I THINK YOU CAN HAVE VERY MUCH ENJOYED HIS PRESENTATION. AND INVITE YOU TO PICK HIS BRAIN AS MUCH AS YOU HUMANLY CAN. OUGHT TO BENEFIT FROM HIS. EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE. BOB I WANT TO START MY TESTIMONY TODAY WITH THE VERY VERY CLEAR. COMMITTEE AND ANYBODY WHO'S LISTENING OR WATCHING. WE HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE. CALIFORNIA ELECTION SYSTEMS HACKED OR BREACHED. TWENTY SIXTEEN. NONETHELESS I OPERATE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT CALIFORNIA AND IT'S VOTING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A TARGET. OF RUSSIAN. AT OTHER STATES AND NOT STATE ACTORS WHO SEEK TO UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN ELECTION. AND BEYOND. THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL. CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE SOME STRONG SECURITY MEASURES IN PLACE TO ATTACKED OUR ELECTIONS. BUT WE MUST CONSTANTLY IMPROVE STRENGTH IN OUR SYSTEM. AND MY OFFICE. JUDGE WITH COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IF WE ARE TO DEFEND AGAINST FUTURE CYBER THREATS. I CONSIDER TODAY AN OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE CYBER THREATS AND SECURITY. BUT A ALSO ASK YOU TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE MUST TALK ABOUT OUR SECURITY EFFORTS. WITHOUT GIVING AWAY THE COMBINATION TO THE. LET ME BEGIN WITH ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT LESSONS. BUT I'VE LEARNED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS SECRETARY. YES ACKNOWLEDGING MATTERS. YES PARTNERSHIPS MATTER. POLICY MATTERS. EQUALLY IMPORTANT IN ALL THIS. CYBER VOCABULARY. PUT SIMPLY WORDS MATTER. WHEN WE ARE PRECISE OUR TERMINOLOGY. OR A MEDIA REPORTS. WE. ABOUT THE TERMINOLOGY THAT WERE USING IN OUR DISCUSSION. WE CANNOT. EASILY GO FROM HAVING CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE. TWO VERY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE I KEEP A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES. THE TERM HACK. FAR TOO OFTEN IT IS USED AT THE BLANKET TERM TO REFER TO A RANGE OF ACTIVITIES OR EVENTS. PERFECTLY A HACK IS DEFINED AS. UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. TO AN INFORMATION SYSTEM WHERE INFORMATION IS MANIPULATED OR STOLEN. TERMS HACK OR HACKED. OR HACKING ARE OFTEN ERRONEOUSLY USE TO DESCRIBE OTHER INCIDENTS AND A WHAT WE'VE READ ABOUT LAST SEVERAL MONTHS IS. SCANNING. RIGHT SCAMMING IS MORE SPECIFIC SCANNING IS WHEN AN AND ENTITY PINGS ON ONLINE SYSTEM FOR A WEAKNESS. SCANNING IS THE EQUIVALENT OF SOMEBODY HAVE YOU KNOW WALKING UP AND DOWN THE STREETS ARE SHAKEN SOME GATES. TO SEE WHO'S HOMEOWNER WHO'S THAT OR WHICH CATER LOCKED OR UNLOCKED. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES WITH ALL MY PRESENTS EXPERIENCE SCANNING. EVERY SINGLE DAY. AGAIN THIS IS JUST THE REALITY THAT WE LIVE IN TODAY. ANOTHER EXAMPLE. OF IT AND AND MAYBE PART OF FRAME TODAY'S HEARING IN THE FOLLOWING CONTEXT I'VE OBSERVED. THREE. SEMI RELATED DYNAMICS GOING ON AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL BUT AS WE STOP AND CONSIDER EACH THAT ARE THERE REALLY DISTINCT. IN OF THE TOPIC UP HERE TODAY AS ARTICULATED MISTER CHAIRMAN IS VOTING SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS IN FRANCE. IT'S SECURE ARE NOT. WAS IT. BREACHED COMPROMISED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE NOT AND THE ANSWER IS NO. THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN. WAS THERE. WHAT IS ART ARE GOING? ASSERTED MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN. BACON DUCTED BY AGENTS OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. VETERANS ABSOLUTELY YES. THE COUPLE WEEKS AGO YOU SAW THE IT AND NOT SORT OF INDICTMENT OF THIRTEEN INDIVIDUALS. RIGHT AND THAT INDICTMENT LATER THAT. AND THERE'S MORE AND IT'S CONTINUE. BUT THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE QUESTION OF WAS THERE A BOOK CHIANG DROVE A TALLY. THAT WAS. ABOUT MANIPULATED CHOOSE NOT. THIRD LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHO WAS THERE WAS ARE NOT COLLUSION BETWEEN WILL. A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OR HIS. FOR HER CAMPAIGN AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. WELL LET. MOLLER WHO COME TO CONCLUSIONS ON THAT CLEARLY THREE DIFFERENT ITEMS RIGHT BUT AS WATCH THE CABLE NEWS AT NIGHT THE STORYLINES TEND TO GET BLURRED. SO GET TO MY POINT CYBER VOCABULARY MATTERS. VOCABULARY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE PUBLIC PERCEPTION. IT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE REALITY OF WHAT DID OR DID NOT HAPPEN IN TWENTY SIX. INACCURATE OR MISLEADING STORIES ABOUT CYBER THREATS DO A GREAT DISSERVICE. IT UNDERMINES THE CONFIDENCE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE. IN OUR ELECTION SYSTEM. MEMBERS IF YOU. OR YOUR STAFF OR ANY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ABOUT MEDIA REPORTS PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO REACH OUT TO MY OFFICE ALLOWED US TO A ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. AND WHEN NECESSARY AND HOPEFUL CORRECT THE RECORD. LET ME TURN TO OUR SUMMER OBSERVATIONS OF ACTIVITIES THAT WERE HAPPENING PRIOR TO. IT CALIFORNIA LONGO IMPLEMENTED MANY SAFEGUARDS FOR VOTING SYSTEMS TO ASSURE VOTERS THERE BALLOTS ARE COUNTED. ACCURATELY AD RELIABLY. STATE LAW REQUIRES. AS CENTER STERN REFERENCE. THAT NO VOTING SYSTEM OR PART OF THE BUILDINGS. IN CALIFORNIA CAN BE CONNECTED TO. TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THE MAGICALLY. OR RIG AN ELECTION. CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS ONE OF THE MOST STRENUOUS VOTING SYSTEM TESTING. EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY. NEW VOTING SYSTEMS APPLY FOR CERTIFICATION IN CALIFORNIA GO THROUGH MONTHS OF TESTING. COULDN'T FUNCTIONAL TESTING. SOURCE CODE REVIEW. RED TEAM SECURITY TESTING THAT INVOLVES. EXPERTS LETTER TO KIND OF BREAK INTO AND COMPROMISED VOTING SYSTEM. AS WELL ACCESSIBILITY AND. VOLUME TESTING IS WHAT. CALIFORNIA CELTIC ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM LOGIC AND ACCURACY TESTING OF THEIR VOTING SYSTEMS. BEFORE EACH ELECTION. AND FOLLOW SPECIFIC PROCEDURES OR PROGRAMMING APPOINTMENTS AND THE USE OF VOTING EQUIPMENT. AS WAS REFERENCE IN THE INTRODUCTION CALIFORNIANS. FOR THE MOST PART CASTOR VOTES ON PAPER BALLOTS. AND THE LIMITED VOTING SYSTEM USED IN CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDE A DIRECT RECORD RECORD ELECTRONIC SYSTEM. IS MAINLY FOR ACCESSIBILITY OPTIONS FOR VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES. MUST HAVE VOTER VERIFIED PAPER RECORDING. FOR AUDIT RECOUNT AND MEDAL TALLY PURPOSES. IN ADDITION. COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS ARE REQUIRED TO CONDUCT A MANUAL TALLY OF WHAT PERCENT OF THE PRECINCTS AS PART OF BE OFFICIAL CANVASS OF ELECTION RESULTS. THE SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE VOTES WERE ACCURATELY READ AND TAP. IT SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. I A SECRETARY STATE CERTIFIED VOTE CAP. OUR NEW STATEWIDE VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASE AS OUR SYSTEM OF RECORD. VOTE CAL ADHERES TO INDUSTRY STANDARD SECURITY CONTROLS ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STEP STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY.

ARE DESIGNED TO PREVENT MALICIOUS ACTORS FROM INTERFERING WITH VOTER REGISTRATION WEBSITES AND DATABASES. BOTH HEALTH DATABASE RESIDE ON SERVERS. LOCATED ON A SECURE INTERNAL NETWORK. AND DESPAIR OF REPEATING THERE'S. YOU KNOW AT A AS FOLKS ARE PAYING ATTENTION THEY'VE ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOTING SYSTEMS BEING SECURED AND. WHAT ABOUT OUR VOTER REGISTRATION INFORMATION BECAUSE WERE ALLOWED TO RICHARD OF ONLINE? VOTE HEALTH DATA. DOES NOT RESIDE. IN THE CLOUT. NO ACCESS EXISTS BETWEEN THE BOOK HELP PUBLIC WEBSITE SERVERS. USE FOR THE PUBLIC WEBSITE AND THE BOOK CAO DATABASE SERVERS WHERE THE VOTER DATA RESIDES. CONDUCT ROUTINE VULNERABILITY SCANS AND SECURITY AUDITS TO PRO ACTIVELY IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS VULNERABILITIES. IN ADDITION WE ROUTINELY APPLY THE LATEST SOFTWARE. SECURITY PATCHES TO ENSURE THAT VOEPEL REMAINS PROTECTED AGAINST EMERGING. AND INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED SECURITY THREATS. VOCA ALSO PROVIDES THIRTY REQUIREMENTS A COUNTY. THE COUNTY MUST PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY. TAG PRETTY AND AVAILABILITY OF THE DATA AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS AUTHORIZED. A TWO PROCESS STORE AND TRANSMIT VOTER REGISTRATION DATA. COUNTY VOTER REGISTRATION AND ELECTION INFORMATION SYSTEMS WHAT'S CONFORM TO RECOGNIZE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT SECURITY STANDARDS AND PRACTICES.

WE'VE CONTINUE TO WORK DILIGENTLY TO HARDEN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND PREPARE FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN THESE ACTIVITIES INFORMED FRANKLY BY WHAT WE LEARNED. A NOT JUST INTERNALLY AT THE STATE LEVEL WITHIN THE STATE FAMILY BUT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ABOUT WHAT WAS ATTEMPTED IN TWENTY SIX. ABOUT WE HAVE SENT TO TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION CONDUCTED AN AGENCY WIDE SECURITY AUDIT. IDENTIFIED HIGH RISK SYSTEMS. THE COMMISSION THEM AND REPLACE THEM. WE REPLACE OBSOLETE DEVICES AND UPGRADED FIREBALLS. WE INCREASED TWENTY FOUR SEVEN MONITORING AND ALERTS CAPABILITIES.

WE ENHANCE THE SECURITY OF OUR SERVERS. WE POSTED CYBERSECURITY TRAINING FOR COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. AND WE ADDED REDUNDANCIES TO OUR SYSTEMS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF POTENTIAL OUTAGES. AND WE INCREASINGLY WORK WITH FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS. PUTTING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. SHARE INFORMATION AND BEST PRACTICES. THE RELATIONSHIP WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES IN PARTICULAR HAS IMPROVED OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR AND HOPE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD. I ALSO. WOULD LIKE TO INFORM THE COMMITTEE THAT I SERVE AS AN ALTERNATE MEMBER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE GOVERNMENT COORDINATING COUNCIL FOR ELECTION THAT DISTRICT. AND THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTRAR VOTERS KNOW KELLY WHO YOU WILL HEAR FROM. A LATER TODAY IS A MEMBER OF THAT SAME COMMITTEE. I'M SPEND A MINUTE BY DISCUSSING RESOURCE. TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OUR CYBERSECURITY MY OFFICE AND COUNTY OFFICIALS NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. I'VE BEEN WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW TO CURATOR RESOURCES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND OUR TECHNOLOGY STAFF. AND AS YOU'RE LIKELY AWARE COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS DO NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVE ANY STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDING. THE NEED TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS IS MOST EVIDENT AND ARE OUTDATED. AGING VOTING. COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE VOTING SYSTEMS ARE AT OR NEAR THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY. THE DUE DILIGENCE OF COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS AND OUR OFFICE. IT'S HELP MITIGATE RISK. TWENTY SIXTEEN WRITTEN FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN. BUT WE CAN'T TAKE THE LONGEVITY OF OUR SYSTEMS FOR GRANTED. COUNTY VOTING MACHINES. SOME INSTANCES ARE LITERALLY FALLING APART. VENDORS NO LONGER MAKE REPLACEMENT PARTS. COUNTIES ARE TURNING TO EBAY AND SCRAP PARTS FROM OTHER STATES. KEEP THEIR MACHINES OPERATING. SOME COUNTIES WERE CUT OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT ARE SO OLD THEIR VENDORS NO LONGER PROVIDE TECH SUPPORT. MEANING CALIFORNIA VOTING MACHINES CANNOT BE PATCHED OR UPDATED. WITH pSECURITY SOFTWARE. MEMBERS. REMEMBER THE TWO THOUSAND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THE AGE OF FLORIDA'S VOTING SYSTEM. TIME CONTRIBUTED TO THAT CRISIS. AND IN RESPONSE. CONGRESS ACTED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. PASS THE HELP AMERICA VOTE ACT. PROVIDED FUNDING. TO MODERNIZE VOTING SYSTEMS IN ALL FIFTY STATES. HOUSE MORE THAN THIRTEEN YEARS AGO. TODAY SEEMS LIKE WE'RE RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED WITH AGING VOTING SYSTEMS THAT ARE AT RISK OF FAILING. CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ALONE CANNOT BEAR THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF PURCHASING. THE NEW SYSTEMS THEY NEED. THEY NEED. YOUR HELP. OUR VOTING SYSTEMS WERE DESIGNED AND ENGINEERED FRANKLY IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES. WHAT DID YOUR CELLPHONE LOOK LIKE? TWENTY YEARS AGO. WHAT DID YOUR TELEVISION LOOK LIKE TWENTY YEARS AGO? WHAT WAS THE CAPABLE OF? AT THAT TIME. WE WOULDN'T SETTLE FOR TWENTY YEAR OLD TECHNOLOGY. AND ON OUR PHONES ARE SMARTPHONES ARE CONSUMER PRODUCTS. AND A VOTING SYSTEMS BE NO DIFFERENT. SO YES I'M THE SPONSOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL SIX SIX EIGHT BY SOME OF EVER GONZALEZ FLETCHER. WHICH SEEKS TO IF YOU UP TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS.

LET ME JUST CONCLUDE WITH THIS AND NOT PREPARED TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY CLEARLY DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO GUARD AGAINST CYBER THREATS. COMMUNICATING CLEARLY AND RESPONSIBLY WITH THE PUBLIC. STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS WILL REMAIN VIGILANT AS A TWENTY EIGHTEEN ELECTIONS YOU'RE UP. WHEN I DO WHAT DAIS FROM ELECTION.

LOSE MEETINGS ARE INCONCLUSIVE SO A I WOULDN'T CATEGORIZE IT OR CONCLUDE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING RAMPANT OR SYSTEMIC ABOUT GOING ON BUT IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THE DA HASN'T. PROVIDED TO OFFICE WERE HAPPY TO INVESTIGATE. WHAT WOULD BE THE? RATIONAL EXPLANATIONS THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO RUN DOWN. IN THOSE HANDFUL THAT. THANK THINGS LIKE GOING BACK AND FINDING EITHER ORIGINAL VOTER REGISTRATION CARD OR BE REGISTRATION RECORDS THAT SHOWED THAT. BUT IT'S PARTY AFFILIATION OR ANY OTHER ISSUE IN QUESTION ADDRESS CHANGE. OKAY AND THEN. THERE WERE TWO RECENT NBC STORIES. RELATED TO THE PREACHER VOTING SYSTEMS. AND. AND HE WAS IN SEVENTEEN STATES. AND OUR I WONDER IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK TO THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT'S THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN NBC STORIES AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON. IT KNOW IS INTO A SIDEBAR. OF A CAPILLARY ISSUE WERE. WHAT? TING PROMPTING MY FIRST GOAL WHO'S WORKED WITH SENATOR ANDERSON YOU CYBER VOCABULARY IS IMPORTANT THAT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. SO A TWO PART RESPONSE ONE THE THE RECENT NBC REPORTS AND THEN. ALTHOUGH SHED LIGHT ON THE. TWENTY ONE STATE. LIST YOUR QUESTION OR ISSUE. THE RECENT AND BEACH REPORTS A. FRANKLY PROVIDED NO NEW INFORMATION. DIDN'T PROVIDE OUR OFFICE ANY. MISSION THAT WE DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE ABOUT PREVIOUS SCANNING REPORTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNNAMED SOURCES SORT OF ALLEGING THAT SOMETHING MORE THAT HAPPENED BUT THEY COULDN'T TELL US EXACTLY WHAT. US ALONE WE RESPONDED. WITH. THAT TO THE ABBEY TO REPORT THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC SECURITY AS WELL. HAD SENT CONCLUSION. A. SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT NBC WHAT INFORMATION A. B. C. NEWS FROM LAST WEEK THINK THEY HAD BUT. THEY'RE NOT SHARON IT IT'S HARD TO TELL THERE'S NOTHING NEW. AT THAN THE PRIOR A SCANNING QUICKLY SCANNING REPORT A. SEVERAL MONTHS AGO SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED THERE LAST FALL.

NUMBER TWO THE QUALITY OF THE IN. RIGHT SEWER I GET. AT OF A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE TRANSPARENT AND HONEST WITH THE PUBLIC QUITS. A CLEAR ABOUT WHAT DID WHAT DID NOT HAPPEN. WILL BE HACKED NO WAS OUR SCANNING. YES SCARY THOUGHT HACK OF RECKLESS GETTING HAPPENS EVERYDAY. AND IT HAPPENS TO THE. UP A TON OF FOLKS. LESSON LEARNED FROM THAT IS THE THE NEED TO A IMPROVE UPON THE PROTOCOLS AND PRACTICES FOR HOW BOTH AND INFORMATION AND INTELLIGENCE SHARED. EITHER FROM COUNTIES TO THE STATES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR THE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE STATES OR NOW TO LOCALS ANDA THAT'S BEGINNING TO HAPPEN. THE SENATOR. SECRETARY. MR ARBOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND DISTINGUISHING THEM BECAUSE. I I pDIALOGUE AS WELL AS THE. THE MEDIA PRESENTATION OFTEN A LOT OF ISSUES ARE CONFLATED TOGETHER YEAH I AND IT DOES MAKE IT A TRICKY UP FOR THE FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO BUY TO FOLLOW AND UP FOR FOR THOSE WHO WERE EVEN A. I IN AN INTERESTED LEVEL FOLLOWING. OF ONE THING THAT. IN TERMS OF HAVING OVERALL CONTEXT OF IT DONE BECAUSE YOU DID THAT DO A GREAT JOB IN TERMS OF PROVIDING OVERALL CONTEXT. OF THE ONE THING THAT I WANTED FURTHER CLARITY ON. I'VE ALWAYS ON THE TIMELINE OF AYE INDEED HOW IDEN THIS LEVEL OF SCANNING. ATTEMPTS TO HACKING ATTEMPTS AT BREACH AYE ATTEMPTS ON WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THIS IS A PHENOMENON THAT'S BEEN PRESENT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY TEN. IN ELECTIONS BEFORE IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S A ON A STEADY UPSWING AS ELECTIONS ARE PROGRESS. I OR IS THIS SOMETHING WHERE YOU FOUND AYE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN PROVIDE SOMETHING OF A UNIQUE SPIKE IF YOU WILL TOOK. AGAIN WALKING THE LINE BETWEEN THE. BEING CLEAR AND AUDITS OF THE PUBLIC VERSES NOT GIVE AWAY THE COMBINATION TO THE SAFE. IMAGES TIE IT. SCANNING NO PRO. ACTIVITY OF THAT NATURE APPETITE A CONSTANT. BASS. TO ANY ENTITY THAT HAS. A PUBLIC INTERFACE BOTH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. OF. YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAID LOOK THERE'S JUST VALUE IN DATA MINING RIGHT. ON THE DARK NET BAD ACTORS. IDENTITY THEFT THAT CETERA. AND TOOK. THAT DRIVES A LOT OF THE ACTIVITY SEPARATE APART FROM THOSE WHO ARE SPECIFICALLY. TARGETING OR OR OR WHO SPECIFIC GOALS IS TO CREATE CHAOS FUSION AND UNDER MY CONFIDENCE IN OUR DEMOCRACY BUT THAT'S A VERY VERY CLEAR OBJECTIVE. AND JUST THE SHEER FACT THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE SUCCEEDED IN PART. RIGHT BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT BEN. COMPROMISE ANY VOTING SYSTEMS ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE AND CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTIONS. CALIFORNIA AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WE'VE SEEN NO EVIDENCE OF THAT UP AT YOUR QUESTION YOU KNOW. TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX I I ASSUME IT'S GOTTA BE HAPPENING. FROM A VARIETY OF ACTORS FOR A VARIETY A OF A OBJECTIVES. LOT PEOPLE LEAD YOU KNOW WHISPERED IN MY EAR TWENTY SIXTEEN THE KANATA SWING STATE IN ECONOMIC A DIFFERENT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAUGHT THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. I DISAGREE FOR CALIFORNIA. AND WE ARE A HIGH VALUE TARGET. IT'S I HAVE TO OPERATE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION WITH WHETHER IT'S IT'S REAL OR NOT AND I CHOOSE TO OF IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE DIDN'T TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE WELL. AND TWENTY TWENTY AND BEYOND. AND. THE FOLLOW UP BY IN REGARDS TO THAT DONE. IS WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE OVER TIME MORE SPECIFIC TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. IN THESE TYPES OF STE. HACKING SCANNING EXCEPT FOR A. AYE EXCLUSIVE TO RUSSIA WAR I OR THEIR POTENTIAL CHINESE STATE OR NON STATE ACTORS OR OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD I IN TERMS OF THE A BASE OF. OF THESE KINDS OF FOR. I INTERACTIONS WITH THE ELECTIONS IT SO AGAIN. YOU. PROBABLY MULTIPLE MULTIPLE SOURCES OF THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY. YOU KNOW AND WE CAN DEBATE OR QUESTIONER INQUIRE ABOUT THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVES OF THE KIND OF ACTIVITY. THE THE THE THREAT AND THE TACTICS ARE WHAT THEY ARE AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO DEFEND AGAINST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA. I THINK MISTER CHAIR. GOOD MORNING MR SECRETARY THANK YOU FOR JOINING US UP I WANTED TO GO BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE COUNTY OFFICIALS IN THE COUNTIES NOT RECEIVING ANY STATE OR FEDERAL MONEY. SO DOES THAT MEAN EACH COUNTY HOUSE TO UP WITH THIS IN THEIR BUDGET SO EACH COUNTY MAY HAVE MORE OR LESS AND REALLY EACH COUNTY. IS OPERATING A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH MONEY THEY ALLOCATE TO THE VOTING SYSTEMS. ARE SOMEONE ABOUT YOU ASKED THAT THE SPECIFIC QUESTION TO THE REPRESENTS IN THE COUNTY THAT THEY CAME UP TO TESTIFY. BUT. YOU SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS YOU KNOW OUR COUNTIES REIMBURSE FOR CONDUCTING A SPECIAL ELECTION. THE FULLER LAKE I THINK THOUGH. A WHERE THE COUNTIES BUDGETS FOR. VOTING SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT. RIGHT THERE'S NOT INHERIT BILL TEN LINE ITEM THAT'S EACH AND EVERY YEAR IT COMES AND GOES OVER TIME AND DEPENDING ON THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THAT WERE ENTERED YOUR BUDGET SURPLUSES ARE DEFICITS. AND HOW THIS MEASURE UP WITH COMPETING PRIORITIES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL RIGHT UP IN EVEN. A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. RIGHT HAD WE AUGMENT THE KEY ANY PARTICULAR COUNTY OF THEIR IT DEPARTMENT AND. FURTHER BETTER TRAINED THEIR IT STAFF. IN AREAS OF CYBERSECURITY ABOUT WHETHER COMPETING MAYBE WITH THE A DIFFERENT CHAU WITHIN THE WITHIN THE COUNTY OR MAYBE TO SATELLITE SO OFTEN TEAR COUNTIES. FUNCTIONS YES EVERY COUNTIES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. BUT WE ALL HAVE A VESTED STAKE IN. FREE AND FAIR AND SECURE ELECTIONS. SO OF BY WHAT I WOULD ARGUE THAT STATE NEEDS TO BE A PARTNER IN THAT INVEST. I AGREE WITH YOU AND I WILL ASK MORE QUESTIONS OF. THE COUNTIES THAT ARE HERE BUT IT WORRIED ME WHEN YOU SAID THAT SOME OF THE ELECTION SYSTEMS ARE LITERALLY FALLING APART SO IF I VOTINGFORWARD ABOUT BEING COMPROMISED WE PROBABLY ONE HAVE THE BEST VOTING. MACHINES OUT THERE BUT THANK YOU. FOLLOWING UP ON THE SANDERS POINT. HEAR YOU MENTION THAT KIND OF. THE. BIGGEST THING THAT WE COULD DO RIGHT NOW IS TO INVEST IN UPDATED. ELECTION SYSTEMS OTHER THAN THAT OTHER CHANGES THAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE MAKING IMMEDIATELY. TO INCREASE ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY. AND I YOU KNOW I GIVE AWAY THE KEYS TO THE SAFE BUT. YOU KNOW I. AND ANYTHING THAT YOU FEEL CONFIDENT OR COMFORTABLE SAYING. BY OTHER. INITIATIVES THAT WE SHOULD BE UNDERTAKING YES I THINK. WHAT WILL ARGUE WORKING A WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO? PROVIDE YOU KNOW CARE A GUIDANCE GUIDELINES. CONSEQUENCES. FOR THIRD PARTIES WHO WERE. A ARE NOT ACCESS TO SOME ELEMENTS OF YOUR. BUT REGISTRATION EIGHT BUCKS EVEN RIGHT THE CURRENT STATE LAW DOES ALLOW. NOT NOT ALL OF THE VOTERS INFORMATION TO SHARED BUT PERTINENT. ELEMENTS OF THE VOTER FILE TO BE SHARED WITH CAMPAIGNS FOR OUTREACH PURPOSES. YOU KNOW JOURNALISTS A ACADEMICS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES AT CETERA. A AND WE HAVE HISTORICALLY JUST TRUSTED THAT THAT DATA WHAT THE THIRD PARTY HAS LAWFUL ACCESS TO THIS PROPERTY. BOB SHORE THAT UP A LITTLE BIT AGAIN. DIFFERENT THAN. A CARING ARCH HURDLES SYSTEMS FOR ELECTION MINISTRATION PURPOSES. BUT WE HEAR FROM TIME TO TIME OWES. SOME OF INFORMATION WAS ACCESSED ON THE WEBER SOMEBODY THIRD PARTY GOT MIGHT BE COMPROMISED. THAT GOES BACK TO UNDERMINING VOTERS COPY TO THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN A OUR ELECTIONS. BOB THAT'S ANOTHER ITEM THAT I THINK THE SLIPPED STITCH WOULD RETAIN SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. THANK YOU.

THE CONCESSION I GUESS WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A RUSSIAN IMPACT ON OUR NATIONAL ELECTION DOWN I'M I'M I'M FRANKLY FRUSTRATED THAT. THAT THEY'VE SET THE FRAME BUT I THINK WE CAN TAKE IT BACK HERE TODAY THROUGH. EVIDENCE OF YOUR DILIGENCE IN HOUSE. IN AYE I OF IT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE. I DID WANT TO ASK ABOUT THIS SORT OF. YOUR SECURITY AUDITS OF ALL STATE AGENCIES. OUR SOPHISTICATION IN BUILDING THE SECURE INTERNAL NETWORKS THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR DATA SYSTEMS. I WANT TO ASK ON THAT FRONT. THERE WAS A. THERE'S A ARTICLE ABOUT A SACRAMENTO BEE. BREACH BUT. I WAS TAKING AN OLD VOTER DATABASE. FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND SORT OF THE PRESS REPORTED AS A HACK. ULTIMATELY OUR VOTER FILES FROM MY UNDERSTANDING WERE NOT ACTUALLY HACKED BUT A THIRD PARTY HAD AN OUTDATED SECURITY SYSTEM IN THIS CASE A NEWSPAPER. CAN YOU HELP US MAKE THAT DISTINCTION TO BECAUSE.

THERE THEIR CANDY RIGHT FOR FOR READERS THEY LOOK THEY LOOK EXCITING IF YOU SEE THE WORD HACK ON THE FRONT PAGE YOU'RE GONNA YOU'RE GONNA PICK UP THAT PAPER YOU GONNA CLICK THAT LINK BUT. JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YEAH I DID ARE TOO GOOD A MORE ABOUT THE DANGERS IN LANGUAGE THERE DISTINGUISHING THAT OUT. THAT PARTICULAR INSTANCE AND DO WE NEED I MEAN ON THAT NOTE I GUESS THAT THE SECOND PART IS. IS THERE ANYTHING WE SHOULD BE DOING. EITHER TO ASSIST THE COUNTY'S IN A SIMILAR KIND OF SECURITY AUDIT. ONUS ON THE CYBER FRONT. TO TO PROTECT ANY VULNERABILITIES ARE INTERFACE WITH PRIVATE ACTORS RATE LIKE WE WE CAN'T TELL A NEWSPAPER. A FROM THE SECRETARY STATEHOUSE NECESSARILY HAD OF HOW TO MANAGE THEIR SERVERS BUT. THAT INTERFACE WITH PUBLIC DATA. JUST HOW DID TIGHTEN THAT UP. KNOW EXACTLY AND SERBIA THE INCIDENT REFERRING TO THE PUBLIC OF A RECENT EXAMPLE OF A. YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS EXPLAINING TO TO CHAIRMAN BERMAN HERE. SO. SACRAMENTO BEE. OF OUR GREAT JOURNALISTS THERE THEY HAVE LAWFUL ACCESS TO VOTER INFORMATION FROM OUR OFFICE. SO WHEN IT WAS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS A. A A BEACH OTHER SERVER YOU KNOW OR SOMEHOW THERE WAS UNLAWFUL ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT WAS BEING HOUSED ON THEIR SERVER. HOW DOES GET WRITTEN RIGHT IN THE NEWSPAPERS ON BLOGS IT'S ATTITUDE VOTER INFORMATION COMPROMISED OR STOLEN OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE? THE SENSATIONAL HEADLINE IT'S. MOST PEOPLE WILL IMMEDIATELY THINK. I OFFICE RIGHT SO WE GET THE PHONE CALLS. WHEN. LOOK AT OUR SYSTEM PAY WERE. WHAT WERE FRONT RUNNER TOES BUT WERE FIGHT HERE? THE REAL INCIDENT WAS A THIRD PARTY. AND SEWER AGAIN WHERE ARE OUR OFFICE OF WORKING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO CRAFT LANGUAGE TO IMPROVE UPON. A THE GUIDANCE. THE THE DIRECTIVES INFECTED REQUIREMENTS AND AND THE CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT FOLLOWING SOMA. SECURE MAINTENANCE OF VOTER INFORMATION FOR THIRD PARTIES. I YEAH I THAT THAT WAS THE OTHER COMPONENT AYE QUESTION THERE'S ON ON THE CONSEQUENCES FRONT. IN ADDITION TO. OUTDATED OR SLOPPY MANAGEMENT ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE OF THEIR OWN SERVERS AND NETWORKS I'M ALSO WONDERING FOR INDIVIDUALS. WHEN THERE'S MISINFORMATION BEING SPREAD SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ELECTIONS SO WE'VE SEEN ALLEGATIONS OF FOLKS SAYING THE WRONG ELECTION DAY LAST CYCLE YOU CAN VOTE ONLINE. THIS KIND OF THIS INFORMATION. THAT GETS POTENTIALLY SORT OF BOMBARDED ON VOTERS IN IT COULD COME LAST MINUTE RIGHT THESE KINDS OF THINGS COULD COME LATE AND THEY COULD. THROUGH DIVERT US IN. CONSEQUENCES FOR THOUGH FOR THOSE KINDS OF ACTIONS AND. WHO ENFORCES TOO BECAUSE I THINK WE WE BLUR THE LINE THERE BETWEEN? ACTUAL CRIMINAL ACTION WHICH SEEMS TO EVEN EMERGE OUT OF YOUR OFFICE INTO THE AG'S FEAR BUT JUST WONDER ABOUT THAT SORT OF. MISINFORMATION NIGHT THAT WAS A BIG CHALLENGE FOR US IN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN READ THOSE A LOT OF. INFORMATION A LOT OF MISINFORMATION THAT WAS OUT THERE. ITS WHAT IN A TALK ABOUT GOOD OLD FASHIONED YOU KNOW CAMPAIGNER INFORMING THE PUBLIC WITH ITS KNOCKING ON DOORS OR WHAT HAVE YOU TO. THE TOOLS OF A TRADITIONAL MEDIA. MASS MEDIA BROADCASTS ITS HEADER VERSES SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. A BED HAVE ON THE UPSIDE THE BITTER REACH A LOT MORE PEOPLE LOT MORE QUICKLY A LOT MORE EFFECTIVELY. GOOD INFORMATION HAD THE DOUBTS HAD TO BE ABLE TO REACH A LOT MORE PEOPLE HAVE MORE EFFECTIVELY. INTO WITH. NOT SO GOOD INFORMATION RIGHT AND AND IT'S THE PROVERBIAL HAD PUT THE TOOTHPASTE BACK IN THE TUBE BAD INFORMATION IS OUT THERE WHETHER IT'S. POLLING PLACE CLOSED. ORDER.

ARE GOOD MORNING TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU ARE ALL FOR HAVING ME OUT AGAIN MY NAME'S BOB MATT MASTERSON. I AM A COMMISSIONER AT THE UNITED STATES ELECTION ASSISTANCE COMMISSION ON HOPEFULLY TODAY CAN PROVIDE OF. A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON WHERE WE ARE NOW WITH CYBERSECURITY IN THE ELECTION SYSTEMS THE WORK THAT'S GOING ON AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WELL AS THE WORK ACROSS THE COUNTRY BY THAT THE GREAT ELECTION OFFICIALS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. I WILL QUICKLY GO THROUGH ROSTER ORAL TESTIMONY YOU HAVE AN EXTENDED VERSION OF MY TESTIMONY THERE ON SO I WON'T DWELL ON ON MUCH OF THAT. ARE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE REAL AND SOPHISTICATED THREATS AGAINST OUR NATION'S ELECTION SYSTEMS INCLUDING DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS VIA SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER OUTLETS. AS WELL AS CYBER THREATS AGAINST HER ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE. THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FEDERAL ELECTIONS DEMONSTRATED ARE THAT WE'RE IN A NEW OPERATING ENVIRONMENT ELECTIONS ONE THAT POSES BOTH NEW CHALLENGES AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLABORATE. THE REALITY IS THAT IN TODAY'S WORLD IF YOU OPERATE ANY IT SIT. INCLUDING ELECTION SYSTEMS YOUR TARGET OF NATION STATE ACTORS FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE AND OTHER SEEKING DISTRAUGHT THIS MONTH DEMOCRACY. ELECTION SECURITY HOWEVER BOTH PHYSICAL AND CYBER IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT FOR ELECTION OFFICIALS NATIONWIDE AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE. SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC VOTING SYSTEMS AND STATEWIDE VOTER REGISTRATION. VOTER REGISTRATION DATA BASES MORE THAN A DECADE AGO ELECTION OFFICIALS HAVE FOCUSED TO BETTER SECURE THE ELECTIONS PROCESS. ELECTION OFFICIALS ARE COMPLEX IT SYSTEM MANAGERS IN FACT IN MANY COUNTIES THE COUNTY ELECTION OFFICE IS THE LARGEST IT SYSTEM OPERATION IN THE COUNTY. AND AS SUCH JURISDICTIONS USE MULTI LAYERED APPROACH TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE LECTURES PROCESS. IN ORDER TO PROTECT VOTERS PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE ONLY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL HAVE ACCESS TO THE VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASE DATABASE TRAFFIC IS MONITORED FOR IRREGULARITIES. EVERY TIME A RECORD IS ACCESS TO CHANGE DETAILS FROM THAT SESSION ARE LOGGED AND ROUTINE OFFLINE BACKUPS HELP ENSURE ALL DATA CAN BE RESTORED. IF ANY UNEXPECTED MODIFICATIONS OCCUR AND ADDITIONAL VOTING EQUIPMENT AS WE HEARD FROM THE SECRETARY'S PUBLICLY TESTED PRIOR TO THE ELECTION TO ENSURE THAT THOSE SYSTEMS ARE READY TO RUN THAT ELECTION WITH THAT PERSONNEL. WITH POST ELECTION AUDITS BECOMING THE NORM. ON THEY ARE BECOMING THE NORM IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER TO AUDIT AT THIS POINT IT'S HOW TO AUDIT. ALL ELECTION OFFICIALS ARE MOVING TO VERIFIABLE AN AUDIBLE VOTING SYSTEMS AND ARE LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE EFFECTIVE AUDITS TO PROVIDE VOTERS. WITH GREATER CONFIDENCE IN THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. CHAIN OF CUSTODY PROCEDURES ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORTING AND SECURING BALLOTS ARE FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT THE ELECTIONS PROCESS VOTING EQUIPMENT IS SEALED AND MONITORED. THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS BY ELECTION OFFICIALS IN APPROVED OBSERVERS BALLOTS AND OTHER SENSITIVE ELECTION MATERIALS ARE KEPT IN SAFE. AND OTHER SECURE AREAS ARE MAINTAINED BY CLERK'S OFFICE WHICH IS OFTEN WITHIN A SECURE FACILITY. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE MEASURES THAT ELECTION OFFICIALS TAKE TO SECURE IN IT NATION'S ELECTION SYSTEMS. WHILEWATCHING OFFICIALS ARE AT THE HEART OF THESE EFFORTS WE AT THE US ELECTION ASSISTANCE COMMISSION OR E. A C.. HAVE LONG HELP THEM IN THEIR WORK TO ADMINISTER ELECTIONS FOR THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE A SAID LIKE OFFER JUST VERY BRIEF BACKGROUND ON OUR WORK. THE A SEA IS A BIPARTISAN INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES WHO WERE NOT AN EXECUTIVE AGENCY OUR BRANCH BUT INDEPENDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE AGENCY ARE CREATED BY THE HELP AMERICA VOTE ACT AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND ELECTION. OPERATES STUDY BY THE WAY HOW MANY CLASSES I NOW SPEAK TO WHERE THE KIDS DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TWO THOUSAND ELECTION AS AND I THINK. MAN I'VE GOTTEN OLD. UNBELIEVING HANGING CHADS KNOW THAT HALLOWEEN COSTUME CHARGES THE AC WITH HELPING ELECTION OFFICIALS ADMINISTER ELECTIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS THIS INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO THE CREATION OF THE VOLUNTARY VOTING SYSTEM GUIDELINES WHICH ARE. GUIDELINES USED TO TEST AND CERTIFY VOTING SYSTEMS TESTING AND CERTIFYING VOTERS VOTING SYSTEMS THROUGH THE FIRST AND ONLY FEDERAL RUN VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. AND PROVIDING BEST PRACTICES TO THE STATE'S REGARDING EVERY FACET OF THE AUCTIONS PROCESS. INCLUDING SECURITY FOR VOTING SYSTEMS AND POLLING PLACES ELECTION DATABASE INTEGRITY AND CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR ELECTIONS IN GENERAL. AHEAD OF THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTIONS ARE WORK TO ADVISE ELECTION OFFICIALS ON BEST PRACTICES TOOK ON A WHOLE NEW DIMENSION. IN THE WAKE OF REPORTS ABOUT ATTACKS ON TO STATE LEVEL VOTER REGISTRATION SYSTEMS THE A SEIZE EFFORTS AND FOCUS TURTON TOWARD WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION TO HELP PROTECT US ELECTIONS FROM SPECIFIC CYBERSECURITY THREATS IDENTIFIED BY THESE AGENCIES. THE A. C. MET ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS WITH STAFF FROM D. H. S. THE FBI THE WHITE HOUSE AND OTHERS TO DISCUSS SPECIFIC AND NONSPECIFIC THREATS STATE LOCAL OFFICIALS. ALEXIAN SYSTEMS ARE WERE FACING AND THE DYNAMICS OF THE ELECTION SYSTEMS AND IT'S EIGHT THOUSAND PLUS JURISDICTIONS NATIONWIDE. THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS FORMALIZED IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY DOOR DESIGNATED ELECTIONS IS PART OF THE NATION'S CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE A. C. LED THE EFFORT TO CONVENE THE ALEXIAN INFRASTRUCTURE SUBSECTOR WORKING GROUP. I WOULD LOVE ACRONYMS IN WASHINGTON AS YOU KNOW. CONSISTING OF STATE LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS AND COLLABORATION WITH THE HST AC WORK TO ESTABLISH THE ELECTIONS GOVERNMENTS SECTOR COORDINATING COUNCIL OR GCC. ABOUT HIS WORK ARE MYCOLLEAGUE AND YOU'LL KELLY WILL SPEAK ABOUT LATER TODAY AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT ARE BETWEEN SECRETARY PADILLA AND NEIL KELLY CALIFORNIA'S WELL REPRESENTED. ON LEADING ON THIS ISSUE WITHIN THE GCC. THE GCC WILL INFORM HOW THE. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY IN EAC WORK WITH STATE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE DESIGNATION OF ELECTION SYSTEMS IS PART OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IS A CRITICAL MILESTONE IN THE EFFORT TO ESTABLISH A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUBSECTOR THAT CAN FACILITATE TIMELY AND ACTIONABLE INFORMATION SHARING AND COORDINATE BETWEEN. OUR ELECTION OFFICIALS AND FEDERAL AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON ISSUES SUCH AS CYBER AND PHYSICAL SECURITY AS WE HEAD INTO THE MID TERM ELECTIONS AND BEYOND. THIS ON IT'S OWN HOWEVER IS NOT ENOUGH. ELECTION ADMINISTRATION THAT ADMINISTRATORS CRUCIAL WORK OF STRENGTHENING THE RESILIENCE OF ELECTION SYSTEMS IS MADE MORE DIFFICULT BY THE LOW FUNDING CURRENTLY ALLOCATED ACROSS THIS COUNTRY TO UPDATE SYSTEMS. AND DEVELOP ADDITIONAL SECURITY EXPERTISE. I KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM CALIFORNIA IS TRYING TO TACKLE PROACTIVELY AND HEAD ON. ELECTION OFFICIALS MUST HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES MONETARY AND OTHERWISE. TO HELP THEM SECURE THE PROCESS IF WE DON'T INVEST IN ELECTION ADMINISTRATION IN INTEGRITY ELECTION OFFICIALS WILL CONTINUALLY HAVE TO MAKE WRIST BASED BUDGET DECISIONS IN AN INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. I IN ORDER TO FUNNEL MORE RESOURCES TO THESE EFFORTS THE AC HAS WORK TO GO BEYOND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND BEGIN FORMING MORE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. IN ADDITION TO OUR WORK WITH THE FBI DHS THE AC HAS WORKED WITH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY SECRETARIES OF STATE STATE ELECTION DIRECTORS LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIAL. ARE THE GOVERNOR'S IS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES SUCH AS ALL HARVARD'S BELFER CENTER THE CENTER FOR INTERNET SECURITY. THE CENTER FOR ELECTION INNOVATION RESEARCH THE CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY AND TECHNOLOGY GOOGLE CLOUD FLARE AND REALLY ANYONE ELSE THAT IS WILLING TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO ELECTION OFFICIALS. ELECTION OFFICIALS NEED TO BE ABLE TO DRAW ON THE EXPERTISE OF NEW PARTNERS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR ACADEMIA. AND EVEN WHITE HAT HACKERS IF WE'RE ABLE TO COMBAT SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS. FROM NATION STATE ACTORS. WORKING ACROSS SECTORS IN INDUSTRIES BOLSTERS THE VAST WEB OF PHYSICAL AN ONLINE SECURITY. ELECTION PERSONNEL IN THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCESSES AND EACH JUROR SICK DICTION THE MAKE UP A SECURE ELECTION PROCESS. IF NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION WE HAVE CLEARLY SEEN THAT THIS YEAR WITH A HOST OF INNOVATIVE NEW ELECTION SECURITY APPROACHES IN RESOURCE IS GENERATED. SUCH AS TABLE TOP EXERCISES PLAYBOOKS CUSTOMIZED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TRAINING TO BEST PRACTICES AND BOOKS. I'VE COME ABOUT. EVEN SO MORE RESOURCES AND SERVICES ARE NEEDED AS WE APPROACH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN MID TERM ELECTION. THERE ARE HOWEVER A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN ADVISING ELECTION OFFICIALS TO DO TO STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY OF ELECTION SYSTEMS. TO PREVENT DETECT AND RECOVER FROM POTENTIAL ATTACKS. IT'S TYPICALLY HERE FIVE THINGS. THAT. WE'VE ENCOURAGED ELECTION OFFICIALS TO DO RIGHT NOW MANY OF WHICH AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE SECRETARY THEY'RE ALREADY DOING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ONE IS ENSURING THAT ALL ASPECTS OF THE VOTING SYSTEM. INCLUDING THE ELECTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM BALLOT CREATION SYSTEM. TABULATION ARE PROPERLY AIR GAPS FROM THE INTERNET THIS INCLUDES USING CLEAN MEDIA TODAY LOAD BALLOTS. TO OUR CONDUCT ELECTION NIGHT REPORTING AND PROVIDE RESULTS ON ELECTION NIGHT. IF A VENDOR PERFORMS THESE TASKS ON BEHALF OF A COUNTY ARE THEY NEED TO HOLD THAT VENDOR ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE SAME PROCEDURES AND PROVIDE THE SAME SECURITY PROTECTIONS THEY HAVE IN PLACE. AUDIT SYSTEMS DATA PROCESSES PROCEDURES FOR ELECTION. PREELECTION TESTING POST ELECTION AUDITING CHANGE A CHAIN OF CUSTODY IN COMMAND ACCESS CONTROLS PHYSICAL SECURITY IN ESSENCE REVIEW THEIR ENTIRE OPERATION TO ASSESS WHAT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. ARE WITH AN EYE TOWARDS CYBERSECURITY. SS DATA RESIDENTS YOU SECURE SYSTEMS APPROPRIATELY ARE USING AVAILABLE RESOURCES. DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE INCIDENT RESPONSE AND RECOVERY PLAN IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT ALL ACTION OFFICIALS WORKING THAT THE STATE LOCAL LEVEL CAN DO RIGHT NOW. DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE INSTANT RESPONSE RECOVERY PLAN THE REALITY FOR ALL OF US IS THAT CYBER INCIDENTS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. WE'RE GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY CYBER INCIDENTS WHETHER IN THE STATE A COUNTY TO A VENDOR OR ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION HOW DID YOU DETECT HOW DID YOU RECOVER AND WHAT YOUR PLAN. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES INCLUDING THOSE FROM DHS STATE GOVERNMENT ACADEMIA PRIVATE SECTOR A COUPLE I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ARE THE PLAYBOOKS OFTEN THE BELFER CENTER. DEFENDING DIGITAL DEMOCRACY PROJECT WHICH CAME OUT TWO WEEKS AGO I WHICH PROVIDE COMMONSENSE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO STATE LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS. TO OUR PROTECT THEIR SYSTEMS RECOVER ARE AN INCIDENT RESPONSE PLANNING AS WELL AS COMMUNICATIONS A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION YOU JUST HAD A WITH THE SECRETARY WAS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RESPOND TO PROVIDE CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS. IN THE BELFER CENTER TOOK A LOT OF TIME WORKING WITH ELECTION OFFICIALS PROVIDE COMMUNICATIONS OUR INFORMATION THE OTHERS FROM THE CENTER FOR INTERNET SECURITY OR SEE I S.. ARE THEY PROVIDED EIGHTY EIGHT TECHNICAL IT CONTROLS BUT ELECTION OFFICIALS CAN CHECK ARE IN USE TO ASSESS THEIR PREPAREDNESS AYE AND CYBER HYGIENE AYE IN PREPARATION FOR THE MID TERM ELECTIONS. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT BECAUSE OF ALL THE ATTENTION THAT'S BEEN PAID ELECTION SYSTEM SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN THEIR NUMBER OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE SOME OF WHICH I JUST HIGHLIGHTED. ALL THAT ELECTION OFFICIALS HAVE NEVER HAD ACCESS TO BEFORE. AS THE ELECTION COMMUNITY WORKS TO CONFRONT THE EMERGING THREATS. THE AC STANDS READY TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT STATE LOCAL OFFICIALS WERE ON THE FRONT LINES OF DEFENSE. WE CONTINUE TO PRODUCE BEST PRACTICES INCLUDING CHECKLISTS FOR VOTING VOTER REGISTRATION DATA BASES ELECTION NIGHT REPORTING AN INCIDENT RESPONSE PLANNING. AND PRODUCTS THAT PROMOTE CYBERSECURITY FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. TO THIS AND THE AC HAS BEGUN EXPANDING ON ITS VOTING SYSTEM PROCUREMENT SUPPORT. OUR THAT IT ALREADY PROVIDES ELECTION OFFICIALS AS WELL AS DEVELOPING CYBER INCIDENT RESPONSE PLANNING TOOLS. THE AC OFFERS HANDS ON ALEXIAN IT MANAGEMENT TRAINING FOR STATE LOCAL OFFICIALS. THE TRAINING FOCUSES ON. THE MINDSET KNOWLEDGE AND RESOURCES NEED A BY ELECTION OFFICIALS TO MANAGE THE DESPERATE AND OUR COMPLEX IT SYSTEMS THAT THEY MANAGE I IN ADDITION TO RESPOND TO. US SOMETHING SECRETARY PADILLA SAYS THE AC HAS AVAILABLE GLOSSARY OF ELECTION I T. TERMINOLOGY AS WELL AS A GLOSSARY OF CYBER ELECTION TERMINOLOGY TO HELP CREATE A COMMON LEXICON. ARE FOR THE ELECTIONS ENVIRONMENT TO USE WHEN TALKING ABOUT CYBERSECURITY IT MANAGEMENT ON ELECTIONS THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO ALLOW ALL OF US TO SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE THAT WHEN WE COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC. MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE OTHER I'M PORTANT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WERE ALL SAYING THE SAME THING CONSISTENTLY. THE EAC ALSO CONTINUES TO TEST AND CERTIFY VOTING MACHINES AGAINST THE MOST UP TO DATE STANDARDS POSSIBLE. ARE THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF OUR VOTING SYSTEM GUIDELINES VSG TO DORADO. WAS RECENTLY RECOMMENDED BY THE A SEIZE TECHNICAL GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE IN SEPTEMBER. WITHIN ANTICIPATED RELEASE DATE IN MID TWENTY EIGHTEEN THESE GUIDELINES ARE WRITTEN TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION AND COMPETITION AND COMPETITION AND HAVE BEEN HEAVILY INFLUENCED. AND. INFORMED BY THE WORK THAT LA COUNTY HAS DONE IN BUILDING AND DESIGNING THEIR OWN FOR VOTING SYSTEM. I CAN ASSURE YOU LA COUNTY IS LEADING THE WAY. THE DILIGENT EFFORT OF THOSE INVOLVED IN A MINISTRY THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THAT ELECTION. BUT WE CAN AND SHOULD ALWAYS SEEK SEEK TO DO MORE. VOTERS WANT AND EXPECT A COORDINATED WHOLE OF NATION RESPONSE TO THESE THREATS AGAINST OUR DEMOCRACY SO THAT THEY CAN HEAD TO THE POLLS OR. BALLOT DROPBOX WITH CONFIDENCE. AND TO THOSE VOTERS I HAVE ONE MESSAGE. GET INVOLVED OFFICIALS RUN ELECTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO ALL VOTERS STAYING GAUGE AND PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS. BECOME A POLL WORKER OBSERVE PREELECTION TESTING WATCH POST ELECTION AUDITING CHECK YOUR VOTER REGISTRATION INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE IT'S UP TO DATE AND CORRECT. ASK QUESTIONS AND ENGAGE YOUR LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY VOTE. THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU. WE NEED LESS FINGERPOINTING AND MORE CANDID AND OPEN CONVERSATIONS AMONG ELECTION MINISTRATIONS FEDERAL AGENCIES PRIVATE INDUSTRY CYBER NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS AND LEGISLATORS WE NEED A PLAN TO INVEST IN ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE ON A REGULAR BASIS. THESE THREATS AREN'T GOING AWAY AND REGULAR FUNDING RESOURCES TO SUPPORT LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS ARE NEEDED TO HELP PROTECT THE PROCESS. ELECTIONS ARE MORE SECURE WHEN WE FULLY COORDINATE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS EXISTING THREATS SURE CUTTING EDGE STRATEGIES THAT STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THEM. IMPROVE INFORMATION SHARING AND HELP JURISDICTIONS BEST PROTECT SYSTEMS WHEN BUDGETS ARE TIGHT. THIS TYPE OF COORDINATED RESPONSE FROM ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WILL ENSURE THE CONTINUED ACCESSIBILITY ACCURACY AND INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTION PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER THAT. BEFORE I JUMP IN THEM CIRCULATE TO SEE IF ANY OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF QUESTIONS. A CHAIR. OUT SORRY SENATOR ALAN. RIGHT FOR SMOG JUST WANTED THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT. AREA OF NATIONAL DEFENSE AND NATIONAL SECURITY. I I JUST WANTED TO TO TO ASK YOU IF THERE'S ANY A PARTICULAR BEST PRACTICE YOU SEEN OUT THERE IN YOUR WORK WITH THE STATE'S. I'M ANY ANY PARTICULAR STATE STORY THAT YOU CAN HIGHLIGHT TO US THAT WE CAN. THAT WE OUGHT TO LEARN FROM AND BE ABLE TO ADOPT OR OR OR BY THE WAY IF THERE'S A BAD STORY. NO BAD STORIES NOT OKAY NOW NOW COP. SURE THERE'S AYE AYE AND FRANKLY HUNDREDS OF STORIES THAT ARE HIGHLIGHT THE KIND OF INNOVATIVE NATURE OF ELECTION OFFICIALS ARE WHO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS UNLIMITED BUDGETS TO HELP SECURE IN AND IMPROVE THE PROCESS. A COUPLE A HIGHLIGHT. ONE IS US SVERAL STATES HAVE. ENGAGE THE NATIONAL GUARD AYE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS TO HELP THEM SECURE THE PROCESS AND IT'S RESULTED IN A KIND OF AN INNOVATIVE. APPROACH TO USING RESOURCES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE A WEST VIRGINIA HAS BROUGHT IN A NATIONAL GUARD MEMBER AS A MEMBER OF THEIR ELECTIONS TEAM TO SIT IN THE STATE FUSION CENTER. I'D MONITOR THAT THE CYBERSECURITY AROUND ELECTIONS PROCESS THAT'S AN INTERESTING I INNOVATIVE APPROACH ARE ANOTHER ONE IN. IS THE STATE OF COLORADO. IT IMPLEMENTED THE FIRST STATEWIDE WRIST LIMITING AUDITS. BUT THE FIRST STATEWIDE WRIST LIMITING AUDITS A WRESTLING AUDITS ARE. NEW. EFFICIENT PERCHED AUDITING I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO APPROACH AUDITING A. IS BUT A COLORADO ON THAT. LARGE SCALE THE STATEWIDE AUDIT. WAS ABLE TO CONDUCT REALLY EFFICIENT AUDITS THE PROVIDED A GREAT DEAL OF TRANSPARENCY IN CONFIDENCE AND SO I WAS OUT THERE TO WITNESS IT AND IT WAS. A REALLY. ONE COOL. TO WATCH BUT REALLY INFORMATIVE. NOW THE KEY FOR COLORADO IS ARE THERE ENTIRELY SENSUALLY COUNTED. STATEWIDE AND SO THAT ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBILITY ON HOW THEY CONDUCT AUDITS AND SO ONE ONE SOLUTION ELECTIONS DOESN'T SERVE ALL EIGHT THOUSAND JURISDICTIONS ARE BUT THERE'S A LOT TO BE LEARNED FROM WHAT THEY GET OUT THERE IN COLORADO FOR SURE. COLORADO SEEMS TO BE A WE WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN LEARNING A LOT FROM THEM WE'VE YOU KNOW EVEN OUR NEW. ELECTION SYSTEM WITH ADDRESS THE VOTE CENTERS WHERE WHERE WE'RE USING A LOT OF THEIR MODEL YEAH I'VE MOVING FORWARD BUT. I'M WILL GOOD I'M I'M GLAD THAT I I ASSUME YOU'RE SHARING THIS INFORMATION WITH OUR SECTOR STATES OFFICE WOULD YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR TIMEFRAME IN TERMS OF YOUR YOU'RE STILL AT THE COMMISSION AND TELL THERE'S A REPLACEMENT THAT SELECTED IS THAT. YEAH THERE'S AYE AYE SENATE CONFIRMATION PROCESS IN. AND I'M I'M THERE DOING THE WORK UNTIL. EITHER THAT HAPPENS OR OR. NEW I OPENER FEW DRUGS ARE LEARNING ABOUT ME. A FOOD TRUCK YEAH WELL MAYBE YOU BOTH YEAH I. NO. BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN APPOINTEE. SUBMITTED THOUGHT SO MUCH MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE. THAT THE SPEAKER. HAS. IT'S IN THE PROCESS WITH THE WHITE HOUSE IT GOES THROUGHOUT THE VETTING PROCESS AND SO IT COULD BE. AT THE WHITE HOUSE COULD USE ANOTHER NAME IT'S IT'S TOTALLY UP TO THEM ON HOW THAT WORKS AND CAN YOU I'M CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP IN THE LAST PANEL WITH REGARDS TO. THE NEWS MEDIA AND WORKING WITH OUR FRIENDS IN THE MEDIA TO HELP BETTER UNDERSTAND AND EXPLAIN AND AND JUST. JUST BE MORE ACCURATE IN IN ADDRESSING THE. THE VARIOUS. TERMS IN THE VARIOUS THE RATS. IT REALLY DOES APPEAR AS THOUGH THERE'S THERE'S JUST SO MUCH. CONFUSION OUT THERE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT IS. IN OF WILLFUL IGNORANCE OR. YOU KNOW. CLICK BAIT. EVEN PRACTICED BY THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA BECAUSE THEY NEED THE CLICKS TO. I A KID YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH WERE WERE WERE WORKING ON ON INFORMING JOURNALISTS. ABOUT THESE. I TERMS AND AND IT JUST IMPROVING PEOPLE CYBER VOCABULARY SURE SO THAT SO I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC QUESTION IN AND. THE ACCURACY AND AND. PURSE PRECISION OF OUR OWN. TERMINOLOGY WILL HELP DRIVE THE WAY THAT THAT FOLKS PUBLICLY TALK ABOUT WHETHER IT'S THE MEDIA VOTERS OR OTHERS AND SO I A REALLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE THAT THAT ALL OF YOU I'M SURE OF EXPERIENCE. IS THE COMPLETION BETWEEN VOTING SYSTEM AND VOTER REGISTRATION SYSTEM ELECTION SYSTEM. THE VOTING SYSTEM IS NOT THE VOTER REGISTRATION SYSTEM THEY'RE NOT ONE IN THE SAME AYE MANY CASES THEY'RE NOT IN ANY WAY CONNECTED AT ALL. BUT WHEN THE HEADLINE SCREAMS VOTING SYSTEM HACKED IT IMPLIES THAT THE TABULATION OR OR. VOTE TOTALS WERE WERE HACKED WHEN IN FACT WHAT WE SAW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS THE TARGET OF VOTER REGISTRATIONS. AND SO THAT VERY IMPORTANT ODD DISTINCTION EYES ONE THAT VOTERS AYE IN AND SOMETIMES THE MEDIA DON'T OFTEN MAKE THAT WE NEED TO REINFORCE AS A COMMUNITY. ARE THAT THE THERE ARE A LOT OF THAT ELECTION NIGHT REPORTING SYSTEM IS NOT THE SAME AS THE VOTING SYSTEM THESE ARE THESE ARE ALL SEPARATE. SOMETIMES DEPENDENT SOMETIMES NOT DEPENDENT SYSTEMS AND THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT THESE NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH PRECISION ASA THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE RIGHT SYSTEMS AND THE RIGHT TYPE OF ACTIVITY ARE THAT WAS OR WASN'T GOING ON ALL THE OTHER PART OF THAT IS TRANSPARENCY THE BEST WAY. I THINK ABOUT THAT I KNOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA YOU ALL I HAVE. O. LAWS THAT SUPPORT. VOTER ENGAGEMENT AND OBSERVATION OF THE PROCESS THAT'S CRITICAL ARE BECAUSE THE BEST WAY. TO EXPOSE THE PUBLIC IN EDUCATE IS TO ALLOW THE MAN TO PARTICIPATE RIGHT. ARE AND SO EMBRACING THAT TRANSPARENCY INVITING THE AN ISSUE THEY TRUST THE LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIAL TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY HAD THAT RELATIONSHIP AND DIALOGUE WITH THEM SO OPENING THE PROCESS OUT. AYE ENGAGING IN THAT WAY I ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS WE SAW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ON A NATIONAL LEVEL IS REALLY THE LOCAL REPORTING. WAS VERY STRONG. THEY WOULD GO OUT TO THE LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIAL OFFICES AND VISIT THE WAREHOUSES THE THE SYSTEMS ARE AND WHAT NOT AND SO IN MANY CASES THE LOCAL REPORTING WHICH MUCH STRONGER. THAT ANDTHEN OF SOME OF THE NATIONAL REPORTING BECAUSE THEY HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH THOSE LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS ARE TO SEE THE PROCESS AND EXPERIENCE AND SO THE MORE WE CAN ENCOURAGE THAT OPEN THE PROCESS UP. I THINK THE BETTER OFF WE ALL ARE YEAH I I CAN AGREE MORE I I DO I DO THINK YOU YOU. USE THE WORD BORING I MEAN THAT THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW. WHAT ABOUT YOU KNOW AND I I HAVE GONE TO LOOK AT? YOU KNOW I I'VE GONE DE AND ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY HERE. TWO TO GO AND SPEND SOME TIME YET AS POLITICIANS WERE ON ELECTION NIGHT WHERE AND WE'RE SO FOCUSED ON THAT. POLITICAL SITE WE'RE GOING TO THE POLITICAL PARTIES WHERE WHERE WHERE. WE'RE DOING THAT THE LAST DITCH GET OUT THE VOTE EFFORTS BUT IF YOU'RE EVER NOT ON THE BALLOT. ON A SPECIAL ELECTION THERE WHATEVER ELSE GO SPEND SOME TIME TO ENSURE RECORDER'S OFFICE AND YOU SEE THAT PROCESS. I PLAY OUT IT IS A LITTLE BIT IT'S INTERESTING AS A AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IS ACTUALLY VERY INTERESTING. BUT I'M BUT GIVEN ARE ARE TWENTY SECOND ATTENTION SPAN SPECIAL. ASIDE. I THINK SOMETIMES THAT THAT AND. YOU KNOW THE THE IF IT'S NOT EXCITING ENOUGH FOR FOR IT FOR PEOPLE TO REALLY GET INTO. AND. AND I GUESS THAT'S WHAT CONSTANTLY CONCERNS ME WITH REGARDS TO AND TO THE PUBLIC AND AND THE MEDIA ATTENTION AND. I BUT I JUST CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IS FOR. FOR FOLKS MAYBE THIS COULD BE YOUR NEXT BIG PROJECT SOME YOU TEAM UP WITH A MEDIA PERSON. AND. AND JUST JUST REALLY FOCUS TIME THAT I TRY TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO YEAH YACHTS AYE I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTION SO YEAH YEAH YEAH YOU CAN DO IT OUT OF THE FOOD DRUG. I YEAH BUT I LIKE WHERE THIS IS HEADED BUT YOU CAN YOU TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY SERVE TACOS AND AND. AND ALSO. IMMEDIATE TRAINING BUT THE REAL YOU KNOW BUT BUT BUT REALLY I'M. ARE YOU KNOW THAT. SPEND SOMETIME WORKING ON THIS AGAIN BECAUSE IT IT'S. IT'S THAT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT COMPLICATED ONCE YOU EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE I'M TERM YOU THE DIFFERENT TERMS A DIFFERENT SYSTEMS BUT THE AVERAGE PERSON'S HAS NO IDEA AND AND FORTUNATELY. THE AVERAGE JOURNALIST HAS NO IDEA I WOULD POSIT THAT THE AVERAGE LEGISLATOR HAS NO IDEA. I AND SO I. YOU REALLY FOR SPENDING SOMETIME. FOCUSED ON I MEDIA LITERACY IN THIS AREA I THINK WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE FOR JOKES IN THE ELECTIONS COMMUNITY AYE AYE I COMPLETELY AGREE AND I I WILL. HUMBLY. SUBMIT TO YOU ALL THAT ARE NOT NOT THIS ROOM OBVIOUSLY BUT THOSE WHO HAVE WON AN ELECTION JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE WON AN ELECTION DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW HOW ELECTIONS RUN RIGHT. NOT THIS ROOM THOUGH OF COURSE. AND SO TAKE THE TIME TO TO DO THAT I CAN TELL YOU THAT NEIL KELLY IN ORANGE COUNTY WHO YOU'LL HEAR FROM LATER HAS A HAS A VIDEO. DOCUMENTARY BEHIND THE SCENES LOOK AT HOW THEY AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL STRIKE YOU WITH EVERY ELECTIONS OFFICE I PROMISE YOU IS THEY LITERALLY ASK THEMSELVES WHAT CAN GO WRONG PLAN FOR THAT AND WHAT ELSE COULD GO WRONG AND SO THE NUMBER OF THEM OUT OF CONTINGENCY. PLANNING AYE IS ON BELIEVABLE. THE QUESTIONS YEAH JUST JUST QUICKLY AND BLAH. REALLY ONCE AGAIN EVERYTHING THAT A CENTER ALLEN SAID AND AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR VIEW THAT YOU KNOW THAT SUNLIGHT IS THE BEST DISINFECTANT FOR FOR SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND CAN AGREE MORE. AND WAS HEARTENED BY YOUR YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THERE ARE A LOT OF. RESOURCES MATERIALS FOR ELECTIONS OFFICIALS BECAUSE. OF YOU SAID THERE ARE OVER EIGHT THOUSAND ELECTIONS JURISDICTIONS NATIONWIDE THAT'S MASSIVE. AND A LOT OF THEM DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OF AN ORANGE COUNTY YEAR SACRAMENTO. AND SO MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE BEST PRACTICES AND KIND OF SHOW THEM SOME OF THOSE PITFALLS THAT MIGHT OCCUR. AND HOW TO HOW TO PREPARE FOR THEM IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. DOWN THE FEDERAL LEVEL SEVERAL BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS ON ELECTION SECURITY ISSUES. AND LAST WEEK IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE HOMELAND SECURITY REAUTHORIZATION BILL MIGHT BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE LANGUAGE STRENGTHENING THE DEPARTMENTS ELECTION CYBERSECURITY MANDATE. DO YOU BELIEVE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE ARE LIKELY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND YOU ALSO MENTIONED EARLIER THE JUST A LACK OF FUNDING AND WHAT A BIG PROBLEM THAT IS. YOU THINK THERE'S ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MIGHT BE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ELECTION SECURITY AT OR AND OR VOTING SYSTEMS REPLACEMENT SURE SO IT'S IT'S A GREAT QUESTION IN. I WILL I WILL NOT. TRY TO GUESS WHAT CONGRESS MAYOR MAY NOT DO. BUT I EVEN WITH THE BILL THAT. OR BILLS THAT ARE OUT THERE MUCH OF THAT WORK THAT'S CONTAINED IN THAT BILL IS ALREADY BEING DONE AS A PART OF A GOVERNMENT COORDINATING COUNCIL WORK OR OTHER. DHS EAC EFFORTS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE INFORMATION SHARING PROTOCOLS THAT ARE. WITHIN THAT THE SECURE ELECTIONS ACTS ON THE SENATE SIDE ODD THAT IT HAS BEEN A FOCUS THE PRIORITY OF THAT THE GOVERNMENT COORDINATING COUNCIL TO ENSURE THAT. A TIMELY AND ACTIONABLE AYE INFORMATION I GETS DOWN ALL THE WAY TO THE LOCAL LEVEL. AS IT NEEDS TO. AND BECOMES AVAILABLE AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEING DONE AS A PART OF THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGNATION WORK OUR REGARDLESS OF SORT OF HOW CONGRESS CHOOSES TO MOVE FORWARD ATTRACT. EYES FAR AS RESOURCES. THAT THE GOOD NEWS THAT I'VE SEEN I KNOW CALIFORNIA'S IN THE MIST MIDST OF THIS DISCUSSION IS STATES HAVE COME UP WITH SOME REALLY CREATIVE WAYS TO DO IT TO TACKLE THIS RESOURCE CHALLENGE. AND FUNDING CHALLENGE MY HOME STATE OF OHIO EYES WORKING THROUGH BILL NOW OUGHT TO SPLIT THE COST BETWEEN THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE IN A PRETTY INNOVATIVE WAY AND THEN TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THE STATE'S PURCHASING POWER SO THAT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS TO GET THE BEST VALUE ON BEHALF THE COUNTIES WHAT THE COUNTY STOP THE FLEXIBILITY AND SO. I WOULD I TELL YOU AS AN OVERALL MESSAGE OF THAT WON'T SURPRISE YOU IS NOT OF THE STATE'S THAT I'VE INTERACTED WITH ARE WAITING TO FIND OUT WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN IN CONGRESS THEIR PROACTIVELY TAKING THIS ON. OUR AND IF SOMETHING GOES ON THOUGH RESPONDED THAT. I DID PRETTY THAT NOTHING THAT'S THE EXACTLY THE MINDSET THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE UP HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR MAKING THAT'S ABOUT A LOT I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE I APPRECIATE THAT THEY INVITE VERY MUCH YEAH. JUST A COUPLE CLOSING QUESTIONS UNLESS THERE'S ANY OTHERS OKAY SO. VERY SIMPLE QUESTION. DO YOU FEEL CALIFORNIA'S ELECTION SYSTEM IS SECURE. I'D I THINK CALIFORNIA'S TAKING ALL THE PROACTIVE STEPS ON YOU HEARD THE SECRETARY LETS THROUGH ALL OF THE WORK THAT HE IN HIS OFFICE OF DONNA KNOWING MANY OF THE REGISTRARS HERE. THEY'RE TAKING ALL THE STEPS THEY CAN OUGHT TO SECURE THE PROCESS BUT I'D I'D ENCOURAGE IN AND THEY KNOW THIS BETTER THAN I DO. OTHER THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS SECURE RIGHT IT'S AN ON GOING. EFFORT THAT THAT CONSTANTLY IS IN NEED OF NEW INFORMATION NEW RESOURCES AND SO ARE ALL OF US ARE WORKING ON A DAILY BASIS TO RESPOND OF INFORMATION WE GET. I PUT IN PLACE THE BEST PRACTICES WE CAN'T EITHER PROTECT THE SYSTEMS OR RESPOND AND RECOVER LET ME ASK YOU THIS IN THIS WAY THEN. ARE WE HEARING TO THE BEST PRACTICE FIVE BEST PRACTICES THAT YOU OUTLINED IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU AS FAR AS I'M AWARE YES I MEAN I'VE BEEN OBVIOUSLY GOOD GONE THROUGH BUT. YOU ASKED A QUESTION EARLIER TO TO. THE SECRETARY ABOUT WHAT STEPS CAN WE HELP. TAKE TO HELP LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS KIND OF EVALUATE THEIR. CYBER POSTURE RIGHT ARE AND I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE CENTER FOR INTERNET SECURITIES. EIGHTY EIGHT. CONTROLS OR ARE A GOOD STEP TO WEAR A LITTLE LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS CAN SELF ASSESS CAN TAKE THAT INFORMATION TAKE IT OVER THEIR IT WHETHER IT'S COUNTY CONTRACTED HOWEVER AND SAY WHERE ARE WE ON THIS WHERE DO WE NEED MORE RESOURCES ABOUT IMPROVE. SO THAT'S A REALLY GOOD OBJECTIVE WAY OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THAT EXCELLENT. AND I WAS GONNA ASK YOU JUST TO BRIEFLY COMMENT ON SORT OF. BEYOND THAT THAT BILL FOR POOR YOU REFERRED TO FROM HARVARD. THAT SORT OF WE WE WERE TEASING US WHEN OUR LAST PANEL TO THE NOTION OF HAVING. PROACTIVE CREDIBLE RESPONDERS AND BUILDING CAPACITY IN THAT SORT OF CUT ON THE COMMUNICATIONS SIDE ON THE PUP FROM THE SURPLUS COMMUNICATE DO YOU DO. IS THAT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE BELL FOR REPORT AND AND OTHER SUGGESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE FOR US IN TERMS OF. ARMENIANS COUNTY REGISTRARS OR SECRETARY STATE OR OTHER ACTORS TO SORT OF. SORT OF B. KNOW WHAT BE LOUDER THAN. THE MISINFORMATION YES SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S IN PART OF WHAT THE BELFER CENTER DID IN THE DEAD THREE PLAYBOOKS AND ONE OF THEM WAS COMMUNICATIONS PLAYBOOK THAT'S. THAT'S GEARED EXACTLY TO THAT UP PROACTIVE MESSAGING PROACTIVE CONVERSATIONS TO HAVE WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN THE ELECTION CYCLE THEM ONCE THEY HAVE WHEN YOU'RE IN IT AND THAT IF THERE IS AN INCIDENT HOW TO TALK ABOUT THE INCIDENT. ARE AND WHAT NOT. BUT THE THE OTHER PART IN THIS AND IT'S A CHALLENGE IS A THIRD PARTY VALIDATORS RIGHT HAVING PEOPLE THAT CAN TALK ABOUT THE ELECTIONS PROCESS INVALIDATE THE STEPS. THAT FOLKS ARE TAKING IS TOUGH BECAUSE THE REALITY IS ARE THAT FOR MANY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THIS ISN'T UNIQUE TO ELECTIONS ARE. PEOPLE JUST ASSUME THAT THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS GO SAY NO EVERYTHING'S OKAY RIGHT AND SO WHAT YOU NEED TO SOME THIRD PARTY VALIDATION ON ELECTION OFFICIALS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB AND WILL CONTINUE I THINK TO DO A GOOD JOB. OF BRINGING THE PUBLIC IN EXPERTS AND OTHERS THAT CAN TAKE A LOOK INVALIDATE THE WORK THEY'RE DOING BECAUSE THIS OPTION IS EITHER GOING TO SAY THAT RIGHT AND SO HOW CAN WE TAKE YOU GETTING THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATIONS THINGS LIKE THAT TO SHOW. WERE TAKING THOSE STEPS WHETHER IT'S AYE SO A WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. AND AND DO YOU FEEL I MEAN IN TERMS OF YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL LANDSCAPE WHERE WHERE WHERE DO YOU SEE S. FALLING IN THERE'S. OUR OUR OUR MODE OUR MOST STATE SORT OF ADHERING TO THE. VOLUNTARY VOTING SYSTEM GUIDELINES THAT YOU'VE ESTABLISHED IN THE A CC I MEAN ARE WHAT WHERE DO WE SORT OF FALL IN THE PACK FOR. THE NATIONAL SURE SO. ONE IS A FORTY SEVEN OUT OF FIFTY STATES YOU SOME PART OF OUR PROGRAM TO EVALUATE THEIR VOTING SYSTEMS THAT COULD MEAN FOR INSTANCE MY HOME STATE. OF FULL CERTIFICATION SYSTEMS WITH THIS WITH THE STICKER PAC STICKER ON THERE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA THEY CERTIFY THEIR OWN SYSTEMS MUCH LIKE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY USE OUR STANDARDS AS AS. I. WHAT A A CORE AT THE CORE OF HOW THEY TEST AND EVALUATE THE SYSTEMS ARE OTHER STATES WILL USE OUR TEST LABS WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN? STANDARDS BY WHICH THEY EVALUATE IT BECAUSE WE ARE CREDIT THE VOTING SYSTEM TEST LABORATORIES I CALIFORNIA HAS FOR YEARS NOW BEEN VERY PROACTIVE IN DILIGENT IN THEIR ASSESSMENT OF VOTING SYSTEMS I IN FACT. WE AT THE AC STOLE ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA SECRETARY STATE EMPLOYEES OUGHT TO COME HELP US A MINISTER AND YEAH I KNOW IT'S A BRUTAL ACTUALLY. UP. OKAY. BOB BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT CALIFORNIA WAS DOING SO YEAH ABSOLUTELY CALIFORNIA I HAS FOR YEARS NOW BEEN BEEN EVALUATING AND AND. INNOVATING AROUND HOW THEY TEST SYSTEMS CREATE ONE LAST QUESTION BECAUSE I KNOWWE GOT TO KEEP MOVING BUT ABOUT THE DESIGNATION OF ELECTION SYSTEM IS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN JANUARY DHS. IDEA WHAT IMPACT YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE THE DESIGNATION MEAN WE USE THIS CRITICAL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGNATION FOR THE POWER GRID OR OTHERS ARE SENSITIVE SYSTEMS THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON NATIONAL SECURITY BUT. TO CENTER AROUND POINT EARLY HE MENTIONED THIS IS A MATTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE NOW WE'VE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED ELECTION SYSTEMS THROUGH DHS AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SO. IF YOU'RE GONNA BE. IT IN IT DO YOU SEE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT THEIR IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY YEAH I DO AT VERY MUCH ON I KNOW. NEIL KELLY'S CAN SPEAK TO THIS AS WELL BUT. THAT THE TWO MAJOR AREAS OF IMPACT ARE ONE. THAT INFORMATION SHARING SO THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE. INEFFICIENT AVENUE TOWARDS. TIMELY AND ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION BEING SHARED WITH ELECTION OFFICIALS THAT OTHERWISE WASN'T AVAILABLE TO THEM PREVIOUSLY. THAT THAT THAT IS THE MAIN FOCUS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR AND I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY VITAL ARE THAT ELECTION OFFICIALS HAVE THAT INFORMATION FOR WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS SHORT SO I ATE A COULD BE EVERYTHING FROM JUST GENERAL CYBER THREAT INFORMATION SO. THAT WITHIN THE EIGHTEEN AREAS A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE DO YOU MAY SEE ACTIVITY IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR OR ELECTRICAL SECTOR THAT CAN HELP INFORM THE ELECTION SECTOR OR COULD BE. ARE MUCH LIKE WHAT WE SAW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. PACIFIC INDICATORS ARE THAT WERE PROVIDED BY THE FBI DHS DOWN THE LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS ABOUT THREATS FACING THEIR SYSTEMS THAT THEY ELECTION OFFICIALS COULD GO BACK AND LOOK. AT THEIR SYSTEMS AND SAY HAVE WE SEEN ANY OF THESE IF SO WHAT HAPPENED ALL WHAT WENT ON IN SO THAT'S THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND WILL RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION I MEAN. EXPLAIN REALLY BRIEF THE FLOW SO IT SURE STATE WHERE WHATEVER ANY DETECTS THE THREAT HOW HOW WOULD THEN MAKE ITS WAY. BACK TO CALIFORNIA YET SO SO THE IDEA WOULD BE EACH STATE'S GONNA HAVE TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT THEIR BEST MODE OF COMMUNICATION AS FAR AS GETTING IT ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE YOU KNOW THE THE LOCAL. OF THE SMALLEST OF LOCALS RIGHT BECAUSE EACH STATE IS DIFFERENT IN HOW THEY COMMUNICATE ACROSS THE COUNTY SOME STATES HAVE MORE CENTRALIZED CONTROL SOME. STATES DON'T BUT THE IDEAS THAT THERE ARE STATE LOCAL POINTS OF CONTACT IN EVERY OUR ELECTION. JURISDICTION IN EVERY STATE ARE THAT AS INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE THERE SOMETHING CALLED THE MULTI STATE INFORMATION SHARING AND ANALYSIS CENTER MSI SACK ROLLS OFF THE RIGHT SUPER ANOTHER ACRONYM WERE HERE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE HERE TO HELP RIGHT. AND THE MSI SACK IS DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SHARE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION WITH WITH STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBAL TECH AND TRIBAL AND TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AND SO UTILIZING THE RESOURCES AT THE IMAX ISAC AS WELL AS. DHS IS CAPABILITIES PUSH IT ALL THE WAY OUT SIR STEP NUMBER ONE I WAS GETTING ALL THE LOCALS IN IN WHATEVER WAY THE STATE WANTS TO GAUGE IT SIGNED UP FOR THEM AS I SAT TO RECEIVE. PA THE ELECTIONS INFORMATION. AND THERE'VE BEEN SOME STATES LIKE A COLORADO. WHICH OF TOLD LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS ONE YOU MUST SIGN UP FOR THEM AS I SECRETARY WHEN YOU YOU HAVE TO DO IT AYE INTO IF YOU HAVE A CYBER INCIDENT YOU MUST REPORT IT TO THE STATES SO EACH STATE KIND OF FIGURING OUT HOW THEY WANT TO HANDLE THAT. AND WHAT LEVERAGE THEY HAVE ON THE LOCALS TO DISSEMINATE. CENTER HERTZBERG. YOU ALLUDED TO THE DAYS PAPA GONE BY OF HANGING CHADS FOR SOME OF US REMEMBER THOSE VIVIDLY. IN FROM FLORIDA AND WE RESPOND HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND WITH A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BOND ISSUE TO UPDATE THE SYSTEM ARE JUST CURIOUS FROM OUR NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. DO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHTS AND WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WE DID IN AND AND WHETHER IT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN ANY RESPECT. BUT CHAU I'D I HAVE NO AYE I ASSUME IT WAS SUCCESSFUL AS YOU'RE STILL A SUCCESSFULLY RUNNING ELECTIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I THAT IT TIME FIFTY THREE PERCENT OF OUR SYSTEMS. IN CALIFORNIA HAD. WELL WHAT WERE FLORIDA HAD WHICH RESULT IN THE HANGING CHAD OR JUST CURIOUS IF YOU HAD ANY RESEARCH IN THAT REGARD FROM A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. IT SO BUT AS FAR AS NOT. RESEARCH AS FAR AS THE WHITE SUCCESS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BOB NOT GOOD HABA YOU HAD ALL THIS OTHER STUFF IS AN HISTORICAL CONTEXT WHICH HAD A BUDGET CHANGE FOR SHORT OF HONORED THIRTY SOME MILLION DOLLARS OF SECTOR STATES OFFICE. TRY TO UPDATE GET FURTHER WE ALSO HAVE LOCAL POINTS OF VIEW I JUST TRYING TO GET YOUR NATIONAL POINT OF VIEW IF YOU SAW ANY OF THAT. I SAW THE IMPACTS AS WELL AS WE FEEL THE ELECTION COMMUNITY EARLIER BEFORE WE SAW THE CYBER PROBLEM WE HAD ANOTHER BIG MANAGEMENT PROBLEM. BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS TO SEE IF HE HAD THE POINT OF VIEW IN THAT YET SO I THINK WELL ONE. IN ONE A PARTICULAR AREA IT WAS PARTICULARLY. IMPACTFUL THAT IS PROVIDING FULL ACCESSIBILITY TO TO VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES IN AND NEEDS TO I MEAN THAT WAS AT THE CORE OF WHAT HAVA. I DID IN WELL IN PART OF THE REASON WHY I THAT CHANGE WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT THERE WERE THERE WERE MUCH UP. MANY OTHER SUBTLE I IMPROVEMENTS THAT I THINK OVER TIME HAVE BEEN CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ELECTIONS AND ONE THAT I HIGHLIGHT. THAT CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY IT'S BEEN VARIABLE THEN IS UP ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF FROM FLORIDA TWO THOUSAND THAT NOW THE NATION. HAS WORKED TO ADDRESS OVER TIME IS. THE USABILITY OF THE BALLOTS IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT VOTERS ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTANDING CAST THEIR VOTE ALLY AS THEY INTENDED AND THERE'S BEEN A TON OF WORK. DONE TO IMPROVE NOT JUST THE SYSTEMS BUT THE ACTUAL BALLOT DESIGN AND LAYOUT. SO THAT VOTERS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE VOTING ON. UNDERSTAND. HOW HOW TO CAST THEIR BALLOT IN THAT IT'S? IT COUNTED APPROPRIATELY GIVE ANY MEASURABLE OUTCOMES THERE THAT YOU THINK IS WIDE ELECTION THE COMMITTEES OF ONE OF THE COMMITTEES I REPRESENT WHERE. CLEAR THERE WAS GREAT CONFUSION ABOUT HOW THE BALLOT WAS WOULD LIKE WE SAW IN FLORIDA AND THE LIKE IT'S STILL HAPPEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND. FOURTEEN YET SO THERE'S. A WEALTH OF RESEARCH ACTUALLY NOW ON BOTH THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE A I CAN'T BE MADE ON BALLOT DESIGN ABOUT LAYOUT EVEN JUST VOTER INFORMATION OF THE A. C.. PROVIDED A GRANT. TO DESIGNING OUR DEMOCRACY GRANT ARE ON THIS AND THAT IT WAS BUILT UP OFF OF THAT WITH AN ONGOING PROJECT BY THE CENTER FOR CIVIC DESIGN. OUR DO IT% LOOKING UP LOOKING AT THIS EXACTLY THIS EXACT ISSUE SO THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OUGHT TO VOTERS TO THERE ARE BEST PRACTICALLY YOUR BEST PRACTICES IN PUBLISHED OUT THERE IN THE LAST. PRACTICE. THE OPEN PRIMARY STATES. YOU KNOW HAVE YOU SEEN THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CONFUSION THERE WERE SOMEONE DON'T DON'T RULE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NATURE OF OPEN PRIMARIES. SO OF THEIR PERFECT PART PARTY PREFERENCE TO PICK THE FIRST ONE IN THE BECAUSE SOME CHALLENGE IF YOU HAD ANY. ANY HOMEWORK IN THAT AREA I'VE NOT SEEN A LOT OF GUIDANCE I KNOW THIS IS A CHALLENGE AND IN IN SEVERAL STATES WITH OPEN PRIMARY SORTA ESPECIALLY AS MORE STATES ARE MOVING TO VOTE BY MAIL AND HOW TO HANDLE THAT AS WELL. AYE WHICH IS IT IS A CHALLENGE AND AND THE ONLY OTHER THING ALL HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU ON YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW THE WHICH IS A REALLY GOOD ONE. IS THERE A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT PURCHASING ARE AND HOW TO PURCHASE SYSTEMS OF WHEN HARPER WAS PASSED AT THE AC CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WAS AN UP AND RUNNING YET. AND THE MONEY WAS PROVIDED AND STATES AND LOCALS WERE TOLD JUST GO BY SYSTEMS I AM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE NOW IS YOU ALL LOOK AT FUNDING FOR ELECTION OFFICIALS. I IN THE WORK OF THAT'S BEEN DONE FOR INSTANCE IN LA COUNTY IS WE HAVE A MUCH MORE INFORMED INFORMED PURCHASER OF ELECTION SYSTEMS ARE ELECTION OFFICIALS. KNOW WHAT THEY EXPERIENCE AFTER TWO THOUSAND NO THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE WITH THE SYSTEMS ARE AND ARE MUCH CLEARER ON HOW THEY WANT THE SYSTEM SHOULD PERFORM THE SERVER VOTERS. AND THAT CAN ONLY HELP BUT SAVE MONEY AND PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE TO VOTERS. THE FOOD TRUCK AND YEAH THE NATIONAL PUBLIC DISSEMINATION CAMPAIGN INVOLVES TACOS IN THAT IS A CULMINATES IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A LOT THEY DON'T IS THAT THE. THAT THE COMMISSIONER AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT SACRAMENTO YES AND WHAT A LOVELY COMMUNITY IT IS. ONLY MY GET INTO THE MOVIES ó NOW. WE'RE ALL IN TROUBLE IF THAT HAPPENS. YEAH THAT WAS MY IT'S IF I DON'T WANNA GIVE IT AWAY BUT IT'S IT'S A RESULT OF FOOD TRUCKS AND WHY NOW PARA. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT LONG YOU JUST GIVE US. WITH THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU AND IF IN YOUR CLOTHES YOU DO WANT TO. ARTICULATE IF YOU HAD A MAGIC WAND. AND COULD DO ANYTHING YOU WANTED WILL YOU I SEE. THIS IS A GOOD VENUE TO. TO TO LET US KNOW BUT. YOU CAN YOU CAN CONTINUE THAT BRAINSTORM TO AND COME BACK TO US YEAH SO I I DON'T KNOW ABOUT A OF A MAGIC ONE. AS FAR AS THE DAC AYE I THINK WERE. EXACTLY WHERE WE NEED TO BE DOING THE WORK THAT THAT WE'RE DOING I'M I'M PLEASED TO BE THERE. ARE THAT THE MAGIC WAND I WOULD HAVE. OR CHANGE I WOULD MAKE IS IS UP FOR I'VE WORKED IN THIS SO JUST OVER A DECADE NOW IN THIS ELECTION TECHNOLOGY SPACE ARE IN RIGHT NOW IS BY FAR AND AWAY THE MOST ATTENTION I'VE EVER SEEN PAID TO IT. AND I HOPE WE ALL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT ATTENTION THAT'S BEING PAID TO GET THE RESOURCES TO GET THE INFORMATION TO GET THE SERVICES ARE AYE I MENTIONED GOOGLE AND CLOUD FLARE. UP GOOGLE IN FLAT CLOUDFLARE CURRENTLY OFFERING FREE SERVICES TO LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS TO HELP PROTECT THEIR WEBSITES. THAT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE OFFERING FROM TWO SIGNIFICANT COMPANIES RIGHT AND AYE I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE MORE PRIVATE. PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS LIKE THAT TO BRING THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES TO BEAR TO THE LOCAL ACTION OFFICIALS BECAUSE THE SMALL COUNTIES IN PARTICULAR ONLY AS GOOD AS OUR WEAKEST LINK. AND THE SMALL COUNTIES IN PARTICULAR OTHERS RESOURCES COULD BE ENORMOUSLY IMPACTFUL. THANK YOU THANK YOU PRITCHETT THAT'S COMMISSIONER. SO NEXT WE HAVE OUR FIRST OF TWO PANELS ON THE AGENDA TODAY. ON THIS PANEL INCLUDES THREE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST EXPERIENCED ELECTION ADMINISTRATORS. IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER THEY ARE NEIL KELLY THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS FOR ORANGE COUNTY. MISTER KELLY IS AN APPOINTEE OF THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE GOVERNMENT COORDINATING COUNCIL THE GCC WHICH WE'VE. TALK ABOUT A LOT TODAY. WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED TO INFORM HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WORKS WITH STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO IMPLEMENT ITS DESIGNATION OF ELECTION SYSTEMS AS PART OF THE NATION'S. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. MISTER KELLY HAS BEEN WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER VOTERS OFFICE FOR NEARLY FOURTEEN YEARS AND IT'S BEEN THE REGISTRAR THERE FOR THE LAST TWELVE YEARS. SECOND DEAN LOGIN AS THE REGISTRAR RECORDER COUNTY CLERK FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY MISTER LOGAN IS ALSO THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLARK'S. AND ELECTION OFFICIALS MISTER LOGAN HAS MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS EXPERIENCE IN ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATION. IN RECORDS MANAGEMENT AT THE LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT LEVELS AND IT'S BEEN THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AND THIRD WE HAVE GAIL PELLERIN THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY CLERK REGISTRAR OF VOTERS. MS PELLERIN HAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE SERVING AS THE PRIMARY ELECTIONS OFFICIAL IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. FIRST IS THE COUNTIES ELECTIONS MANAGER AND SHE'S HOW THE POST OF COUNTY CLERK SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR. MS PELLERIN HAS SERVED AS AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVER WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ALEXIAN OBSERVATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TEAM AND IT'S BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S VOTING ACCESSIBILITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE. IT'S TWO THOUSAND SIX. AND THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH WE'RE WE'RE REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE ALL THREE OF YOU AYE HERE JOINING US TODAY. AND A WHAT. APPARENTLY LED THE THREE OF YOU DECIDE WHO YOU GO FIRST. AND AND. CORD POOR NIELSEN GETTING THROWN OF THE BUS ABOUT YEAH. GOING INTO THE LAWS OF MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MISTER CHAIRMAN AND A CHAIRMAN STERN BOTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I JUST WANTED TO SAY. BEFORE I START IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD DAY WHEN I HAVE TO FALL SECRETARY PEDIA AND COMMISSIONER MASTERSON SO GIVE IT MY BEST SHOT. ME TO SOMEONE HARPER YOU RAISE A POINT ABOUT SCANNING SYSTEMS AND I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU WHY BEEN SITTING HERE IN THE OFFICE OUR SYSTEM HAS BEEN SCANNED FOR ABOUT. I TAKE FIVE THOUSAND TIMES A RIGHT TO THE FAR WALL FROM IP ADDRESSES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY SO TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE THAT THE. TYPE OF OF SECURITY IN ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ARE AT THE FOREFRONT EVERYDAY. SCURRYING ELECTIONS HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPORTANT THEME A PARADIGM SHIFT OCCURRED IN SECURITY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTIONS WHEN WIDELY REPORTED ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO DISRUPT ELECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION ON ISSUES RELATED TO BALLOT INTEGRITY VOTER REGISTRATION SYSTEMS AND ENSURING THE ELIGIBILITY OF VOTERS. AS A RESULT IN ORANGE COUNTY WE'VE BEEN AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. I BELIEVE IN A PROACTIVE RING OF SECURITY. IS CRITICAL TO SAFEGUARD THE MILLIONS OF BALLOTS ARE CAST IN ORANGE COUNTY. EVERY YEAR. AS YOU WELL KNOW IN YOU SPOKE TO CHAIRMAN STERN A IN JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE DEPARTMENT HOMELAND SECURITY. DESIGNATED STATE AND LOCAL VOTING SYSTEMS AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO OFFER A FEDERAL RESPONSE TO THESE THREATS. MANY ELECTION OFFICIALS ARE BOLSTERING CYBERSECURITY AND RESILIENCE LEVELS AS WELL AS PHYSICAL SECURITY WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. FOR FUTURE ELECTIONS BY FOCUSING ON THE KEY DIGITAL COMPONENTS. OF THEIR ELECTION SYSTEM SUCH AS VOTER REGISTRATION DATA BASES ELECTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND. THE ALL CRITICAL IMPORTANT ALEXIAN AT REPORTING SYSTEM. I AM ONE OF TWENTY FIVE ELECTION OFFICIALS HALF OF WHICH ARE SECRETARIES OF STATE THAT HAVE BEEN APPOINTED TO THE U. S. DEPARTMENT HOMELAND SECURITY GOVERNMENT COORDINATING COUNCIL OR GCC. FOR THE ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR MY INVOLVEMENT AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL GIVES ME UNIQUE INSIGHT INTO THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH TRYING TO PROTECT NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND DISPARATE ELECTION. JURISDICTIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THE GCC IS TO FOCUS ON COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS THREAT NOTIFICATION INCIDENT RESPONSE AND EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS. TWENTY SIXTEEN CERTAINLY SHOWED US THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO IMPROVE THIS COMMUNICATION THERE IS A LOT OF PRESS ATTENTION I'D AROUND THAT VERY ISSUE. THE GCC IS NOW FINALIZING COMMUNICATIONS PROCESSES FOR ELECTION SPECIFIC NOTIFICATIONS. WE'VE ALSO PROMOTED THE LEVERAGING A MULTI STATE INFORMATION SHARING FUSION CENTERS AS COMMISSIONER MASTERSON SPOKE TO FOR CONTINUOUSLY MONITORING THREAT DETECTION AND INCIDENT AWARENESS AND RESPONSE. MEMBERS OF THE GCC ARE NOW GOING THROUGH FEDERAL BACKGROUND. CLEARANCES IN ORDER TO EXCEL AT ACCESS TIMELY THREAD INFORMATION. SO I THINK YEARS IMPORTANT QUESTION HOUSES GOING TO BENEFIT LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS. NOT JUST THE GCC MEMBERS. TO THAT END THE GCC IS ACTIVELY WORKING ON DEVELOPING A SECTOR SPECIFIC PLAN WITH INFORMATION FOR LOCAL ELECTION OFFICES THIS WILL OUTLINE THE FEDERAL RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THOSE LOCAL OFFICES. IT WILL PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HARDENING ELECTION SYSTEMS AND DELIVER A TEMPLATE FOR BEST PRACTICES. WHICH INCLUDES TRAINING TABLETOP EXERCISES CHAIN OF CUSTODY PROCEDURES AND MORE. THERE CURRENTLY IS A WEALTH OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE FROM HOMELAND SECURITY AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL GUARD WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN TO THAT WILL PROVIDE ENHANCED SECURITY FOR EVEN THE SMALLEST ELECTION OFFICES. AND MANY OF THESE RESOURCES ARE FREE OF CHARGE SOME SOME THERE ARE CHARGES BUT MANY OF THEM FREE. FOR INSTANCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH DHS ELECTION OFFICES CAN REGULARLY MONITOR ELECTION SYSTEM THREATS AND VULNERABILITIES TO DEFEND ANY CYBER RELATED NETWORK ATTACKS. INCLUDING PHISHING SCAMS MALWARE DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS AND OTHER COMMON PRACTICES EMPLOYED BY MALICIOUS ACTORS. IN ADDITION PARTING WITH DHS AN IN HOUSE IT ADVISORS PRIVATE SECURITY PARTNERS STATE AND LOCAL SAYS THOSE AND OTHERS WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT ELECTION SYSTEMS ARE SECURE WITH TECHNOLOGIES AND STANDARD OPERATING PRACTICES. SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I GOT UP EARLY ON WHEN WHEN I WAS INVITED TO SPEAK WAS YOU KNOW THERE A FEW COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE STILL USING ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS ORANGE COUNTY BEING ONE OF THEM. NUMBER FORTUNE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAVE THE REQUIREMENT OF HAVING A PAPER BACK UP ON THOSE ELECTRONIC BOOTHS. THESE VOTER VERIFIED PAPER LA BALLOTS PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF EACH VOTERS INTENT IN A WAY THAT CANNOT BE COMPROMISED BY COMPUTER ELEMENTS OF THE VOTING SYSTEM THAT'S CRITICAL. IN ADDITION AIR GAPS PROTECT AGAINST NETWORK INTRUSIONS AND STRICT STEALIN CHAIN OF CUSTODY MEASURES ARE IN PLACE. NOW THERE ARE MANY BRILLIANT MINDS AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A GOOD DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE THAT SEALS PROVIDE AID A LEVEL OF SECURITY THAT IS. AND NOT THE BEST. ARE HOWEVER I FEEL IT THESE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE ARE STRONG BARRIERS. AND AND THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT. SO IN MY OPINION THAT'S NOT ENOUGH AND I WANT TO GET INTO A LITTLE BIT OF THE MEAT POTATOES SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING TODAY. WE MUST CONSIDER MY OPINION MOVING TOWARDS A ROBUST SYSTEM OF RISK LIMITING AUDITS. PURPOSE OF A SOUND ELECTION AUDIT IS TO PROVIDE CONFIDENCE THAT ELECTION OUTCOME IS CORRECT. ANY POTENTIAL ERRORS AND TABULATION MUST BE DETECTED AND CORRECTED. RISK LIMITING AUDITS CAN BE INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT. AN ELECTION WITH TENS OF MILLIONS OF BALLOTS CAN. ATTENTION WOULD BE CHECKED BY EXAMINING ONLY A FEW HUNDRED RANDOMLY SELECTED BALLOTS. I PLAN ON CONDUCTING ONE OF THESE RISK WINNING AUDITS IN JUNE AS A PILOT PROGRAM. ON THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS TO SHOWCASE A PROOF OF CONCEPT THAT YOU CAN'T ON LEGACY SYSTEMS CONDUCTORAS LOOMING ON IT AND I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL. THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON VOTING SYSTEMS COMMISSIONER MATCHES AND TALKED ABOUT THIS DELINEATION BETWEEN VOTING SYSTEMS AND VOTER REGISTRATION SYSTEM. BUT IN MY OPINION THE REALITIES IS GREATER VULNERABILITIES THAT ARE OUT THERE. OUTSIDE OF THE VOTING SYSTEM. SO FOR INSTANCE WE KNOW THAT IT VOTER REGISTRATIONS. WAS SUCCESSFULLY INTRUDED UPON IN ILLINOIS WERE SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND VOTER RECORDS. WERE AT STAKE. IN ORANGE COUNTY THERE ARE ON AVERAGE I WANNA GIVE A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE TO S. RATES WE HAVE ELEVEN HUNDRED DEATHS THAT OCCUR EACH MONTH IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND I WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE TO DETECT WITHIN MY VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASE ANY ANOMALIES IN THAT DATA MY SING ANY TRENDS THAT MIGHT BE OCCURRING THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY SIMPLE TO DO. BUT WHAT ABOUT PARTY CHANGES. WHAT A PARTY CHANGES WERE DONE IN A SUBTLE WAY THAT THAT WERE IMPERCEPTIBLE THAT YOU COULD NOT DETECT THEM? HAVING THE ABILITY TO DETECT NUANCES IN THE DATA WOULD BE INVALUABLE. CAPTURING SNAPSHOTS OF THAT DATABASE IN CONDUCTING AUDITS ON THE VOTER REGISTRATION SYSTEM I THINK IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS CONDUCTING AUDITS ON THE VOTING SYSTEM. OUR A AND IT'S CRITICAL. FINALLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT FUNDING ISSUES I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT ELECTION OFFICES HAVE SUFFICIENT EQUIPMENT TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN A SOUND SECURITY POSTURE FOR THEIR ELECTION BASED SYSTEMS. INCLUDING REPLACING AGING VOTING EQUIPMENT THAT IS NEARING AND OF LIFE I'M ONE OF THOSE CITIES USING WINDOWS TWO THOUSAND ON A PORTION OF THE SYSTEM AND LOVE TO ENGAGE ON THAT DISCUSSION. THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THAT. BUT NO LONGER MEET STATE TESTING AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND SOME OF THE SYSTEMS AND THEY WILL SOON FAIL TO MEET SUCH REQUIREMENTS DUE TO A LACK OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND REPLACEMENT PARTS. I'M GRATEFUL TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE GOVERNOR FOR INCLUDING FUNDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF SYSTEMS. BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT LOST ON THIS COMMITTEE I JUST WANT TO TO PUT IT OUT THERE THAT CONGRESS HAS STILL NOT APPROPRIATE THE FULL THREE HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS LEFT IN HAVA. THAT NEEDS TO BE APPROPRIATED IN MY HUMBLE OPINION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THANKS VERY MUCH. TO LOGIN. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BERMAN AND CHAIRMAN STERN AND MMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M DEAN LOGAN THE REGISTRAR RECORDER COUNTY CLERK FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY I'M HERE TODAY BOTH IN MY CAPACITY AS THE CHIEF ELECTIONS OFFICIAL FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY. BUT ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLARK'S ELECTION OFFICIALS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A PART OF THE THE CONVERSATION TODAY ON CYBERSECURITY CALIFORNIA LECTIONIS. FIRST AND FOREMOST ON BEHALF OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY REGISTRARS OF VOTERS WHO REPRESENT THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND OF ELECTION ADMINISTRATION IN THE STATE. I WANT TO CONVEY HOW SERIOUSLY WE TAKE THE SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTIONS PROCESS. LOCAL AND STATE ELECTION OFFICIALS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN SYSTEM SECURITY AND EXCISING DILIGENCE AND MONITORING FOR THREATS AND VULNERABILITIES THAT UNDERMINE OUR ELECTIONS PROCESS. I WE'VE HEARD FROM A PREVIOUS BECAUSE AND I APOLOGIZE THE REPUBLICAN HERE A LOT OF REPETITION HERE BUT THAT WEEK WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. THE REPORTS AND WE'VE BEEN ASSURED THAT THERE WERE NOTES THAT THERE'S NO SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO DEMONSTRATE THAT CALIFORNIA ALEXIAN SYSTEMS WERE COMPROMISED. OR THAT THE VOTE TABULATION PROCESS AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH MANIPULATED IN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER WITHOUT QUESTION OUR AWARENESS AND ALERTNESS IS HEIGHTENED BASED ON THE RECOGNIZABLE ACTIVITY AND THREATS. THAT HAVE BEEN REFERENCED IN YOUR BRIEFING PACKETS AND BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THERE ARE BAD ACTORS ACTIVELY TRYING TO DISRUPT THE ELECTIONS PROCESS AND THAT THREAT IS COMPOUNDED BY INCONSISTENT INFORMATION SHARING AND INCIDENT REPORTING? AS WE MOVE INTO ANOTHER MAJOR ELECTION CYCLE IT'S INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF US FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS TO BE VIGILANT ABOUT SECURITY WHILE ENCOURAGING ACTIVO TO PARTICIPATION TO DEMONSTRATE THE STRENGTH OF OUR REPRESENTATIVE FORM OF GOVERNMENT. WITH RESPECT CYBERSECURITY PREPAREDNESS FOR ELECTIONS THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT POINTS ODD TO REMEMBER FIRST CYBERSECURITY IS NO DIFFERENT FOR ELECTIONS THAN IT IS FOR OTHER CRITICAL SECTORS INVOLVING THINGS LIKE HEALTHCARE PUBLIC SAFETY AND FINANCIAL SERVICES. THE BEST CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES ADOPTED BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF GOVERNMENT IT IS FREE ARE EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATION AND STRICT ADHERENCE TO THOSE PRACTICES IS ESSENTIAL TO ELECTION SECURITY. SECOND CYBERSECURITY INVOLVE SEVERAL LAYERS OF PROTECTION AGAINST ATTACKS INCLUDING PHYSICAL SECURITY GENERAL IT SECURITY PROTOCOLS AND SYSTEM SPECIFIC FEATURES. EACH OF THESE LAYERS IS PRESENT IN THE CYBERSECURITY DEFENCES PROTECTING ELECTIONS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND EACH INVOLVES PEOPLE AND PROCESSES IN ADDITION TO HARDWARE SOFTWARE AND FACILITIES. WE REMAIN CONFIDENT THAT OUR SYSTEMS DESPITE THEIR AGING LIMITED AGILITY IN COMBINATION WITH THE APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS AND PROTOCOLS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY. CAN ENSURE A SECURE ELECTION ENVIRONMENT TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THAT SAID IT REMAINS INCUMBENT UPON US TO BE VIGILANT IN MONITORING AYE SYSTEMS ACTIVITY IN ADHERING TO THE OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO IT SECURITY AND ELECTION TRANSPARENCY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE AS PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE HAVE DONE SO THAT MUCH OF THE CONCERN RAISED ABOUT THE INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTIONS PROCESS IS RELATED TO ACTIVITY OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF VOTING SYSTEMS THAT ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATION. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AND ALLEGATIONS HAVE CENTERED AROUND INTERFERENCE WITH POLITICAL DATA SOURCES AND WITH FALSE OR MISLEADING MISLEADING SO FROM MEDIA. OUR MESSAGING. WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE DIRECT ABILITY TO COMBAT A REGULATE THAT ACTIVITY I'M THAT'S EXTERNAL TO THE VOTING SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES. WE DO SEE THIS AS AN INTEGRAL ELEMENT OF THE VOTER OUTREACH AND EDUCATION UP PROVISIONS OF OUR OFFICES IN THAT REGARD WE WANT TO SEEK TO ESTABLISH AND PROMOTE TRUSTED SOURCES OF INFORMATION. FOR VOTERS TO SEEK INFORMATION ABOUT THE VOTING PROCESS AND WILL DO THAT BY ACTIVELY SHARING ANY CLARIFICATIONS OF WARNINGS THAT CAN HELP VOTERS IDENTIFY INFORMATION THAT IS NOT COMING FROM TRUSTED SOURCES. OUR MAINTAINING THE RESOURCES FOR THAT TYPE A NOTIFICATION SYSTEM AND FOR BROUGHT OUT REGION EDUCATION ACTIVITY HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY. I WILL BE CRITICAL TO THAT EFFORT. IN ADDITION OF WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN I COVERED IN TODAY'S HEARING IT'S IMPORTANT AND AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR THIS FROM ALL OF US TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SECURITY THREATS AND VULNERABILITIES REFERENCED. LINK TO A RESOURCE THAT. WHAT CALIFORNIA BENEFITS FROM A POLICY FOUNDATION THAT HELPS INSURE SECURITY? AND THESE HAVE BEEN STATED THAT ARE WORTH REPEATING THINGS LIKE A WELL ESTABLISHED VOTING SYSTEM CERTIFICATION PROCESS THE REQUIREMENT PAPER BASED BALLOTS THAT CAN BE VERIFIED BY VOTERS AND THAT ARE SUBJECT TO POST ELECTION AUDITING. A CLEAR EMPHASIS ON TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND A SET OF VOTING SYSTEM STANDARDS THAT SUPPORT FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION. HOWEVER DESPITE THAT POLICY FOUNDATION OUR CORE ELECTIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS LARGELY OUTDATED AND UNMATCHED TO THAT POLICY FOUNDATION. MOST COUNTIES IN THE STATE AS YOU'VE HEARD ARE RELYING ON TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT FOR VOTING THAT IS MORE THAN TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AND RELIANT ON USER INTERFACES THAT LACK THE ACCESSIBILITY. AND FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES TO MEET THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF A LARGE DIVERSE AND COMPLEX ELECTORATE. WE ALSO LACKS STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING TO INVEST IN MODERNIZE SYSTEMS AND SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY OUR CORE VOTING SYSTEM COMPONENTS DATE BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT ONE PUNCH CARD VOTING WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA. AND LET ME JUST PUT THAT INTO SOME VERY CLEAR PERSPECTIVE. THAT MEANS THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE CORE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE USE FOR VOTING AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY PREDATES THE TWO PREVIOUS SPEAKERS WHO ARE HERE AT THIS HEARING. AND PREDATES THAT STAFF AND THE TEAM THAT ARE WORKING ON THE NEXT GENERATION OF VOTING SYSTEM IN OUR OFFICE AND THEY WERE DEVELOPED AFTER OUR VOTING EQUIPMENT. EFFORTS IMPLANTS TO MODERNIZE IN LA COUNTY HAVE BEEN STYMIED BY SHRINKING AND INSUFFICIENT PROPRIETARY COMMERCIAL MARKET. AND AT TIMES BY UNSTABLE INFLEXIBLE REGULATORY STRUCTURE. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'RE NOW ON THE CUSP OF INTRODUCING OUR VOTING SOLUTIONS FOR ALL PEOPLE INITIATIVE A LINE TO THE VOTING MODEL ENVISIONED BY THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT. AND GROUNDED IN PUBLICLY OWNED OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPED VOTING INTERFACES AND SYSTEM COMPONENTS. SECURITY AS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR US IT IS ONE OF OUR CORE PRINCIPLES IN THE PROJECT. THE VOTING SYSTEM WILL HAVE FEATURES FOR SAFE AND SECURE STORAGE INCLUDING FEATURES SUCH AS LOCKS AND SECURITY SEALS TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE EQUIPMENT WHILE IN THE CUSTODY OF ELECTION WORKERS. AND WHILE IN THE STORAGE OF ELECTION OFFICIALS. IN PURSUIT OF THIS EFFORT WE ESTABLISH AND WORK CLOSELY BUT THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT INCLUDED HIGHLY RESPECTED EXPERTS IN SECURITY. AND WE WILL ENGAGE IN THIRD PARTY TESTING AND HACKING EXERCISES PRIOR TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE EQUIPMENT. FULLY REALIZING THE BENEFITS AND SECURITY PROVISIONS OF THE NEW LOS ANGELES COUNTY MODEL AND OTHERS LIKE IT WILL REQUIRE A FUNDING COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT THE INITIAL INVESTMENT. THE NECESSARY OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION. AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY THE GOVERNOR HAS INCLUDED A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN VOTING SYSTEM MODERNIZATION FUNDING IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET. THAT SIGNALS THE RECOGNITION OF THE NEED AND A COMMITMENT OF SUPPORT. BUT IT FALLS SHORT OF WHAT IS NEEDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS NEEDED TO INCREASE AND CONTINUE THE FUNDING AND FUTURE BUDGETS INTEL WE HAVE REPLACED AND IMPLEMENTED NEW VOTING SYSTEM THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. CONSISTENT WITH THIS DISCUSSION ON SECURITY. IN CLOSING I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT I AND MY COLLEAGUES ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED ON THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEVELS IN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS INFORMATION SHARING AND COLLABORATION AROUND CYBERSECURITY IN ELECTION INTEGRITY. AS NEW INFORMATION IS THE SENATE FROM THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WE INSURE ALL COUNTIES ARE WELL INFORMED. AS RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING SECURITY PROTOCOLS CHECKLISTS AND TOOLS ARE MADE AVAILABLE WE MOVE SWIFTLY TO ENSURE OUR PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES ARE LINED. WE RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS DIALOGUE AND OUR RESPONSE HAS AND AND THE RESPONSE THAT HAS ON VOTER CONFIDENCE PARTICIPATION. WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO RAISING THE PROFILE OF THESE ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA AND WE STAND READY TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE U. S. ELECTION ASSISTANCE COMMISSION THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY THE SECRETARY STATE. AND THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ELECTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER LOGAN MS PALLOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR BERMAN AND CHAIR STERN COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY. AND I AM WELL THANK YOU FOR IMPROVING THE GENDER DIVERSITY OF HELL A THANK YOU GOT THAT THAT PROBABLY ONE OR TWO WOMEN SPEAKING TODAY. AND SO I'M GAIL PELLERIN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY CLERK REGISTER VOTERS WE ARE SMALL COUNTY A HUNDRED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND REGISTERED VOTERS I HAVE EIGHT ADD TEAM MEMBERS WHO HELPED ME WITH THE A THE JOB OF CONDUCTING ELECTIONS AND. UP WE ARE ALL CROSS TRAINED SO I MYSELF AM INVOLVED WITH UPDATING MY WEBSITE I DO COUNT IT FILING I ANSWER THE TELEPHONES I HELP AT THE COUNTER WE ALSO DO WEDDINGS AND PASSPORTS FICTITIOUS BUSINESS NAMES. AND AND WE HAVE A VERY SMALL TRAVEL BUDGET I'M HERE TODAY ON MY OWN TIME WHICH I AM A HAPPY TO DO IT LIKE THAT TO SEE MY DAUGHTER AT UC DAVIS AND HAD DINNER WITH HER LAST NIGHT SO. IT'S MY PLEASURE AND BUT ONE OF THE THINGS TO PUT ON MY NOTES HERE AS I AM NOT A CYBERSECURITY EXPERTS. AND THE REASON IS WE ARE SMALL AND WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER DUTIES I DO HAVE OF. A PERSON WHO RUNS BY IT DEPARTMENT MARTIN PETE AND WHO IS THAT MILITARY SECURITY EXPERTS WHO DOESN'T EXPLAIN JOB BUT I NEED TO RELY ON OUR COUNTY INFORMATION SERVICES DEPARTMENT. SECRETARY STATE YOU KNOW LARGER COUNTIES THAT HAVE INFORMATION OR CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION A CLERK THAT ELECTION OFFICIALS EAC I ALL THESE GREAT RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE I NEED TO RELY ON THEM FOR INFORMATION. AND IT BUT AT THE COUNTY CLERK IN CHARGE OF THE SYSTEM YOU KNOW THAT THE SOMETHING THAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT. THE SECURITY OF OUR VOTING SYSTEM UP WE ARE UP AGAINST TROLLS BULLIES HACKERS A POTENTIALLY TERRORISTS AND IT'S GREAT THAT ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE I UNDERSTAND A CALIFORNIA THERE'S ALSO SIXTEEN AREAS THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AT WITH THE WATER ELECTRICAL WHICH ACTUALLY KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT AS WELL AND. AND YOU KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY ALL TECHNOLOGY HAS SOME VULNERABILITIES AND WE DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING TRIPLE CHECK EVERYTHING WE HAD THE PAPER ABOUT WE DO THE AUDITS AND. AND YOU KNOW AND ALL EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN GATHERED BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT WE ARE MAINLY DEALING WITH TROLLS. WHO ARE SCANNING OUR SYSTEM BASICALLY KNOCKING ON THOSE DOORS PRIMARILY VOTER REGISTRATION SO I THINK THAT THAT HOW WE'RE? PRESENTING THIS IN THE MEDIA'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND THE EFFORTS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHERE THERE ARE TWENTY ONE STATES ARE SCANNED BY RUSSIAN IP ADDRESSES THERE WAS ONLY THAT ONE INSTANCE IN EL ILLINOIS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ACCESS THE VOTER DATA NO RECORDS WERE ALTERED OR DELETED. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT OUR FIREWALLS HAVE PREVAILED AND THEY DID NOT GET IN. AND. I THINK THERE GOAL THOUGH IS TO. BRING DOUBT INTO PEOPLE'S MINDS ABOUT THE INTEGRITY AND THE ACCURACY OF OUR VOTE AND IN THE HOPES THAT WE STAY HOME AND DON'T VOTE. AND SO I REALLY AM TRYING TO GET OUT THERE TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING SIGNED UP. AND SHOWING UP ANDREW AND AT THE POLLS. AND. SO WHERE THERE WAS A FAILURE TO HALF THE VOTE I BELIEVE THERE WAS A GREAT SUCCESS AND HACKING IN PEOPLE'S MINDS AND BELIEFS. AND I HAD THIS IS NOT NEW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. THE FEDERALIST PAPERS FROM ALEXANDER HAMILTON WARNED AMERICANS TO BEWARE OF FOREIGN EFFORTS TO HIJACK U. S. ELECTIONS. AND AN INTERESTING I BUT WORK IN THIS BUSINESS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AYE WE RECENTLY MOVED OUR OFFICE AND IN THE PROCESS OF PACKING UP FILED LIKE FOUND A FOLDER ON THIS GREAT NEW THING CALLED THE INTERNET. AND I HAD THESE GREAT NOTES AND COMMENTS IN THERE ABOUT HOW WONDERFUL THIS NEW TOOL IT THEN AND I ACTUALLY HAVE A SCREEN SHOT ON ELECTION NIGHT WHEN THE SECRETARY STATE THOUGHT OF OFFICE OR. WEBSITE WITH ACT OF WITH THAT INAPPROPRIATE IMAGE ON ELECTION NIGHT SO I STILL HAVE THEM BUT ONCE THAT. AND BUT IT ALSO THE TODAY WITH THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA IT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER FOR THESE TROLLS TO USE BOTS TO SPREAD THEIR LIES AND DECEIT AND POOR FUEL ON THIS FIRE. AND YOU KNOW TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE IS INFORMATION OUT THERE THAT THAT. THAT THE POPE HAD ENDORSED TRUMP AND THAT AFTER THE PARK WHEN SHOOTING IN RUSSIA AND THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL MEDIA FIGHT FOR UP AND RUNNING WITH INFLAMMATORY PRO AND ANTI GUN CONTROL MESSAGES WITHIN HOURS OF THOSE KILLINGS. ALL WITH THE CAMPAIGN TO DISRUPT AND DIVIDE. AND AND I GET SO FRUSTRATED WITH THAT BECAUSE WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT'S. AND YEAH I WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE FACTORY STATE OFFICE ARE COUNTY FORMATION SERVICES TEAM UP TO ENSURE THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE PROTECTED FOR MANY CYBER INVASION. ARE VOTER REGISTRATION NETWORK TO THE FACTORY STATES OFFICE IS ISOLATED AND WE HAVE A SOPHISTICATED EN POINTE PROTECTIONS ON SERVERS AND WORKSTATIONS. OF VOTE HOW HAS ONE PIPE TWO SEPARATE STATE WITHIN THE DATA'S ALL ENCRYPTED. AND WE HAVE NEXT GENERATION FIREWALL THAT SECURITY APPLIANCES DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE NETWORK WHICH BLOCK KNOWN THREATS AND PROVIDE REAL TIME REPORTING OF SUSPICIOUS OR ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR ON THE ELECTIONS IT INFRASTRUCTURE I GOT THAT FROM MY AYE TEACHING. AND. WE HAVE NO REMOTE ACCESS SOFTWARE ON OUR SERVERS AS IF THERE EVER IS AND KNOWN THREAT TO ALEXIAN SYSTEMS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE AND LOCAL ELECTIONS OFFICIALS BE NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY. SO THAT WE CAN FOR ANY EFFORT TO COMPROMISE OUR SYSTEMS IT'S SO FRUSTRATING GETTING THAT THE NEWS MONTHS OR YEARS LATER. AND OF COURSE CALIFORNIA AND OF THE DECENTRALIZED VOTING THAT SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WERE ALL INDEPENDENT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SO I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT A HACK IN THE SYSTEMS. AND. OUR VOTING SYSTEM INCLUDE THE STANDALONE VOTING EQUIPMENT THAT IS NOT TIED TO ANY NETWORK OR INTERNET YOU'VE HEARD THAT HERE TODAY. AND ARE A YOU KNOW WE HOW THE TEMPER PROOF SEALS WE DO ALL THE AUDITS AND. AND THERE IS DEFINITELY A NEED FOR MORE FUNDING WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE OLD SYSTEMS. THAT WE DO NAY REPLACE BUT I WANT TO GUARANTEE THAT IT IS SECURE AND WE DO HAVE A LOT OF. PROCESSES IN PLACE WITH YOU KNOW TO PERSON CHAIN OF CUSTODY AND AND LOTS OF LIVES TO MAKE SURE THAT. EVERYTHING IS PROTECTED AND AND OF COURSE ALL VOTERS WILL VOTE ON PAPER RECORDS THAT ARE THOROUGHLY AUDITED WE AND THEN IN THE EVENT THAT A VOTER DOES SHOW UP TO VOTE AND THEIR NAMES ON THE LIST WE HAD THE PROVISIONAL VOTING NOW IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE. SAME DAY CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION AS WELL WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO AND REGISTER UP TO INCLUDING ELECTION DAY IF THEY'RE NOT CORRECTLY ON THE LIST. THAT WE DO THE RESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE VOTING EQUIPMENT A WE'VE BEEN INVESTIGATED BY A GRAND JURY TWICE AND HAD GLOWING REPORTS WITH OUR SECURITY THAT WE HAVE THAT WE DID AND IMPLEMENT. RECENTLY THE THUMB DRIVES ONE WAY ONE USE AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING AS WELL. WE MONITOR AND BACK UP AND LOG OR DATA DAILY. AND WE ARE DOING THE. THE PENETRATION TESTING TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A STRONG SYSTEM AGAINST THAT ANY BREACH OR ATTACK. THAT BOTTOM LINE IN MY VIEW IS AMERICA IS UNDER ATTACK. IT HAS BEEN UNDER ATTACK. IT REMAINS UNDER ATTACK. AND THE US GOVERNMENT IS DOING VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT. SO I AM VERY PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY WITH ALL OF YOU BECAUSE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WITH THAT YOU HAVE VERY WELL SAID. LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES. FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE OF OUR. COUNTY ELECTIONS LEADERS. JUST TURN. OPUS ART CENTER ALLEN. A LOT OF FOR BEAUTY THAT HOT HOT HOT HOT. YEAH CANNELLA SO IT'S A. YOU KNOW. YEAH WELL. YEAH. A. WHY PRETTY APPRECIATE AND NOT ONLY THE TESTIMONY BUT ALSO ALL THE HARD WORK THAT GOES BEHIND HAND YOUR PRESENTATIONS? SO I'VE HEARD. I'D LOVE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON AND A PUSH THAT'S. CURRENTLY UNDER WAY WITH THE CROWDS TO OPEN SOURCING. THE THE DID BASICALLY THE SYSTEMS THAT UNDER GIRD. YOUR WORK. AND LEGISLATURE BY THOUGHTS ON ON THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE. IN THE GOOD GOVERNANCE GONNA WATCH STOCK COMMUNITY ARE REALLY SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING. I DOUBT INSURANCE TAG READY IN OUR IMPROVE INTEGRITY EFFORTS AND WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR VARIOUS THOUGHTS. I'M HAPPY TO TALK MEANT FOR YOU DON'T YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT YEAH OKAY SO. IN AND THAT IS ONE OF THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF THAT THE VOTING SOLUTIONS FOR ALL PEOPLE. INITIATIVE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS TO TO DEVELOP THE THE. THAT THE CORE UNDERPINNINGS THAT SYSTEM USING OPEN SOURCE PLATFORM I THINK WHEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT OPEN SOURCE SOLUTIONS IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT. YOU CAN GO BACK TO SECRETARY PREVIOUS POINT TO THEIR THERE IS THERE'S A VOCABULARY AROUND OPEN SOURCE TO IN AND A LOT A LOT OF DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS THAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON WHAT TYPE OF LIFE AND THINK SHOULD BE USED. WHETHER WHETHER OPEN SOURCE MEANS THAT YOU'RE PUBLISHING THAT OUT ON GET HAVE BEEN MAKING IT AVAILABLE ARE PERMITTED TO DOWNLOAD AND AND CONTRIBUTE TO IT THERE THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT. ARE I THINK FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE JUST SPEAKING FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S PROTECTIVE IN THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE ON MOVING FORWARD OUR FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE IS THAT THAT WE WANT TO HAVE. THE CORE. DEVELOPMENT OF OUR VOTING SYSTEM WE WANT THAT TO BE A PUBLICLY ON SYSTEM WE BELIEVE THAT THAT ELECTIONS ARE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO PUBLIC THEY SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO PROPRIETARY LIMITED SYSTEMS WHERE WHERE WHERE THAT SOURCE CODE CANNOT BE REVIEWED SO WE HAVE WE HAVE PUT IN THE PROVISIONS OF OUR F. P. THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF BASED ON THE DESIGN SPECS THAT WE THAT WE ARE ON THE IP FOR. THAT THAT BE DEVELOPED ON AN OPEN SOURCE PLATFORM HOW THAT GETS LICENSED AND HOW THAT'S MADE AVAILABLE TO BE SHARED WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND HOW THAT SECURED. A IS STILL VERY IMPORTANT. TO DO SO I ALWAYS MAKE THE DISTINCTION THAT. WE ARE WE ARE OPERATING ON A PROJECT THAT IS THEY'VE VOTING SYSTEMS PROJECT. NOT OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPMENT. IT SAID THAT THE NFL LITTLE BIT OF ANYONE SO WHERE WERE USING THE FUNDAMENTALS AND THE STRENGTH OF OPEN SOURCE BUT IT IS NOT A DEMONSTRATION OF OPEN SOURCE AT THE DEMONSTRATION ON. HOW TO GET THE BEST VOTING SYSTEM THAT WILL MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR VOTERS SO IT'S FOR VOTERS FIRST AND THEN WE WILL? WE WILL EXTEND THE THE OPEN SOURCE PLATFORM BEYOND THAT SO BUT ALL OF THAT SAID I THINK THAT. I I CAN TELL YOU FROM THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE THAT FOR INSTANCE THAT OUR TALLY SYSTEM THAT THAT WE PLAN TO HAVE CERTIFIED AND AN OPERATING FOR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS IN NOVEMBER. A HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND IS BEING DEVELOPED ON AN OPEN SOURCE PLATFORM AND THE USER INTERFACE FOR ABOUT MARKING DEVICES THAT WILL. BE OPERATING AT ABOUT SENATORS AND TWENTY TWENTY. ALSO IS REQUIRED TO BE DEVELOPED ON AN OPEN SOURCE PLATFORM A AND I THINK THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT CENTER LEYVA. REFERENCE IN A QUESTION TO SECRETARY VIDEO EARLIER IS THAT THAT WE DO HAVE DISPARITY IN TERMS OF RESOURCES AND OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES BASED ON SIZE AND RESOURCES AND LA COUNTY WHEN WE. UNDERTOOK THIS PROJECT IN SOME WAYS WE WERE FORCED INTO THAT'S BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A SYSTEM AVAILABLE FOR US BUT. OUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE BECAUSE OF OUR SIZE AND BECAUSE OF THE RESOURCES WE HAVE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME WAY. THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHOLE OR IN PART AND WHERE ARE THE OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPMENT WILL ENABLE US TO DO THAT. OKAY. MYTHS ABOUT IT'S BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY QUICK ANSWER FOR ME AND THAT IS WE WERE OP ARE LOOKING FOR SYSTEM TO. A MORE OPEN TO OPEN SOURCE AND LOOKING AT THOSE SYSTEMS I THINK THAT THE GOOD THING ABOUT OPEN SOURCE IS THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING SUCH A SOVEREIGN DEPENDENCE IN THE POTENTIAL FOR END TO END VERIFIABLE SYSTEM SO. GOOD STUFF THAT ARE HAPPENING THE MARKETPLACE. AND JUST AS FAR AS THE CODE BEING AN ESCROW SHOULD THERE BE ANY DISCREPANCY WITH THE VOTING SYSTEM THEY CAN ACCESS THAT AND REVIEW IT SO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S LOCKED UP AND EVERYTHING. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE EVERYONE'S ON THE SAME PAGE WHAT WHY THE. I'M A* OFFLINE BABS TENET WHAT WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S EVANS NERVOUSNESS THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ALL PRETTY AMENABLE TO THIS. I I. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT THAT THE NERVOUSNESS IS AROUND THE OUR LINE. AS WELL I ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACED IN LA COUNTY IS THAT. THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE EVEN THE FEDERAL MONEY AND STATE. PROPOSITION MONEY. THAT THAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF PUNCH CARD VOTING SYSTEMS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO USE THAT MONEY EVEN THOUGH WE STILL HAVE EARMARKED UNLIKE ANYWHERE NOT ABLE TO USE THAT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SYSTEM. BECAUSE IT IS REGULATED FOR THE USE OF ALREADY CERTIFIED VOTING SYSTEMS WHICH WHICH LIMITS YOU TO THE OPTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND THAT LIMITED PROPRIETARY MARKET PARA WE'VE WE'VE MADE EFFORTS TO CHANGE THAT. THROUGH THROUGH LEGISLATION ON LAST COUPLE YEARS AND AND MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN PARTNERS IN THAT BUT WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GET CAUGHT UP WITH. WITH THAT IN A WAY THAT WOULD INCENTIVIZE. NOT JUST COUNTIES BUT ALSO AT THE COMMERCIAL MARKET TO START LOOKING AT MORE OPEN IN THE END. THEY SOLUTION I THE REALITY IF I HAD A BUCKET FULL OF MONEY TODAY AND I WENT TO THE VOTING SYSTEM STORE TO BUY A VOTING SYSTEM THERE'S. TWO ON THE SHELF. DO YOU THINK SO YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST NOT A GOOD SELECTION REALLY HE WON HAVE MORE OPTIONS AVAILABLE AT ALSO WE NEED TO GET THE MONEY ONE ONE THING WE FOUND OUT WE DID GET THAT HALL THEN THAT PROP FORTY ONE MONEY. IT PAID FOR THE VOTING SYSTEM BUT IT DIDN'T PAY FOR THE CARE AND FEEDING OF THE VOTING SYSTEM SO THAT THE WAREHOUSE THING WE HAD TO HIRE A NEW STAFF PERSON TO MANAGE THE WAREHOUSE AND. AND YOU KNOW JUST A IT REQUIRED A LOT MORE LOCAL SOURCES THAT YOU KNOW FUNDING SOURCES WE HAVE TO DO AS WELL AND IT'S JUST BEEN A STRESS PERSONAL COUNTY. OKAY ANOTHER THING I HEAR ABOUT FROM FOLKS YOU KNOW AND AND OBVIOUSLY. THIS IS A SUPER SENSITIVE RIGHT TO PEOPLE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTEGRITY THE SYSTEM PART OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SECRET BALLOT WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR SYSTEM AND YET IT IT ALSO. AND LEADS TO AN ACTUAL LEVEL OF NERVOUSNESS FROM PEOPLE BECAUSE IT INVOLVES. I AM YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T JUST TRACK VOTES. IVAN SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM. I'M. ONE THING WE HAD A HEARING A LOT ABOUT AND UNITED BENNETT PANELS IN FORUMS WHERE WHERE FOLKS BROUGHT UP. THE WHOLE QUESTION OF OUR AUDITS. I AND DONE SOME. CHANGES THAT MADE BEEN MADE IN THE WAY THAT WE DO AYE THAT'S A LETTER TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT. IT WITH THINGS THAT WE CAN TELL CONSTITUENTS IN OUR DISTRICTS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE AUDITING PROCEDURES AND. SO THAT FOLKS CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN AND TO ENSURE INTEGRITY IN A TIMELY MANNER. THERE THE YOU GET YOU GET SOME FOLKS OUT THERE WHO ARE SOMETIMES CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT NINE. WHAT THEY MAY PERCEIVE AS? SHORT CUTTING. THE AUDIT PROCESS AND. LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT. SO I WOULD JUST REITERATE LET LET NIELSEN HIS TESTIMONY I I DON'T THINK YOU WILL FIND A RED STAR. IN CALIFORNIA THE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE IDEA OF MOVING TO WARDS A RISK WHEN MANY AUDIT MODEL IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT. WE ARE WORKING IN OUR ASSOCIATION ON THE ON THE BILL TO TO DO THAT THERE'S THERE'S THAT UP BILL THAT'S ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED. I IT WHICH BILLS AT THAT TIME AS TO WHO'S RUNNING AT. ASSEMBLY MORE QUICKLY WITH RUNNING THAT HAD THE BILL NUMBER I GET IT OKAY NON. IT. IT'S A COMPLICATED AREA IN NEEDS AND NEEDS A LOT OF WORK AND SO THERE THERE THERE IS A COALITION OF PEOPLE WORKING BOTH INSIDE THE ASSOCIATION OF CLIQUES ELECTION OFFICIALS AND WORKING WITH. STAKEHOLDERS AND AND. ELECTION INTEGRITY ACTIVISTS ON ON THAT PROCESS ONE OF THE THINGS THE CHALLENGING IN THIS REGARD IS IS A LOT OF THE MODELS FOR IF BY ME LIMITING AUDITS ARE BASED ON. A STATEWIDE ELECTION RESULTS AND IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE WEIRD. AT. WE DISTRIBUTED AND AND WE WE DON'T TEND TO THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T TEND TO MANDATE. THINKS TO APPLY TO ALL COUNTIES BECAUSE THERE'S A COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND THAT CUTS HAVE TO BE PAID SO WE ARE WE'RE ACTIVELY TRYING TO WORK ON THE STRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR COUNTIES TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION I THINK IT'LL TAKE AWHILE TO DO THAT. A AND OUR INTENT IS FOR THAT TO BE USED AS A REPLACEMENT OF THE ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY THAT'S THAT'S CURRENTLY IN PLACE THERE'S UTILITY IN THE ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY I'M WITHOUT QUESTION IT PROVIDES TRANSPARENCY IT'S IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE TO. OBSERVE AND UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT STATISTICALLY BASED AND IF YOU GO BACK IN THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY IT WAS INTENDED. TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE VIABILITY IN THE ACCURACY OF THE COUNTY EQUIPMENT NOT TO. NOT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE PARTICULAR CONTEST WAS CORRECT RISK LIMITING AUDIT SEEK TO DO THAT. THAT LATTER TO TO ACTUALLY REINFORCE THAT THE OUTCOME ON BASED ON THE STATISTICAL MODEL IS AS AS YOU WOULD EXPECTATIVA COUNT MORE BALLOTS UNTIL YOU REACH THAT I'M. THAT THRESHOLD SO I THINK THERE'S GENERAL SUPPORT I THINK SOME OF THE CONTROVERSY ARE CONCERNED STATE THAT THAT YOU'VE HEARD. AND AND AT THE EVENT THAT YOU AND I RECENTLY WHERE AT I'M WERE MORE ABOUT METHODOLOGY AND ALSO ABOUT PRACTICE I MEAN PRACTICALLY SPEAKING. OF WE HAVE TWENTY EIGHT DAYS TO CERTIFY THE ELECTION AFTER ELECTION DAY CRITIQUE THAT INCLUDES. YET NOW IT'S THIRTY. THAT INCLUDES A LATE ARRIVING VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS WERE VERY PROUD IN CALIFORNIA OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE. I CAREFULLY EXAMINED PROVISIONAL BALLOTS AND VALIDATING COUNT THOSE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT TO ENFRANCHISEMENT IF YOU IF YOU TRY TO SQUEEZE IN A A ROBUST AUDIT IN THAT SAME PERIOD. I'M SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE SO IT'S A THERE'S A TIMING AND OPERATIONAL CONCERN BUT PHILOSOPHICALLY I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD FIND A REGISTRAR IN THE STATE THAT WOULD NOT AGREE. WITH MOVING TOWARDS A MORE ROBUST WITH LIMITING AUDIT FUNCTION BIDS EDITOR I'M SORRY. I WAS GONNA SAY AND I THINK TO WE WERE LOOTING TO US THAT THE INCLUSION OF PROVISIONAL BALLOTS INCLUSION OF VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS WRITING AFTER NEARLY AS PART OF THE AUDIT PROCESS. AND THAT SPEAKS I THINK TO THE INEFFICIENCY THE WILD INEFFICIENCIES IN THE ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY AND SOME COUNTIES HAVE THE PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO INCLUDE THOSE AND SOME HAVE A LOT OF DIFFICULTY DOING THAT AND THAT. AGAIN POINTS T WHY WE NEED THIS WRESTLING ON A PROCESS. AND HERE'S THE REALITY WHEN YOU HAVE A CLOSE CONTEST AS THE PERSON WHO CAN BE CITING THAT STATEMENT VOTE ATTESTING TO THE VOTE THE ACCURACY THAT VOTE. I WILL BE RECOUNTING EVERY SINGLE BALLOT IN THAT CONTEST DEPENDING ON HOW CLOSE IT IS FROM WE'VE DONE THAT WITH THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ RACE BUT WE HAD ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND VOTES IN THE RECOUNT IT AT ALL AND. I LOVE YOU KNOW SO SO READ AND I KNOW REGISTERED ACROSS THE STATE DO THIS AS WELL SO BELT ESCALATE THEIR AUDIT WHEN THEY DO HAVE VERY CLOSE CONTACT THAT WE GOT YOU DO WE PACK CAO YEAH WE'VE HAD TYPE VOTES BEFORE TO. YOU KNOW AND HAD BEEN WAIT CERTIFY THAT I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE I KNOW EVERY NUANCE OF EVERY BALLOT IF I LOOKED. NO AND BEING SMALL YET WE'RE STILL MAY VERY. YEAH. WE ARE THOSE WHO REMEMBER. YOU KNOW THAT IN MIND DO YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO ANY I'M. IS THERE ANYTHING WE ARE BE KEEPING IN MIND IN THE CONTEXT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION SP FOUR FIFTY. WITH REGARDS TO THE THEMES THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY. I'VE BEEN. NINA. MANY THINGS WERE NOT THINKING ABOUT A GIVEN THE FACT OR ABOUT TO SHIFT OVER TO THIS NEW SYSTEM. I GUESS TWO THINGS COME TO MIND FOR FOR ME ONE IS AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS DURING EARLIER TESTIMONY AND WE. I BELIEVE THAT THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THE VOTER CHOICE ACT AS BEFORE FIFTY AND GO A LONG WAY AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE THE COMPREHENSIVE INCIDENT RESPONSE RECOVERY PLAN BECAUSE OF THE. ELEVEN DAY VOTING PERIOD OF VOTE SENATORS BECAUSE OF THAT PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO CORRECT THEIR REGISTRATION OR MAKE CHANGES AT THAT BUT CENTER AT THE TIME THAT THEY'RE VOTING. THAT. THAT. INCREASES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR VOTERS TO TO BE ABLE TO CORRECT ANY ISSUES THAT HAVE IMPEDED THEIR ABILITY TO TO VOTE RIGHT NOW THOSE ON AVAILABLE AT INDIVIDUAL POLLING PLACES SO. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THAT THAT MODEL OF VOTING GOES A LONG WAY IN ADDRESSING. SECURITY CONCERNS THE THE OTHER PIECE I WOULD SAY IS IS AGAIN BACK TO THAT THE RECLAIMING AUDIT MODEL IS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THE FIVE COUNTIES THAT ARE. IMPLEMENTING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ARE ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH IT HOW DO YOU APPLY THE ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY TO ABOUT CENTER MODEL WHERE VOTERS ARE VOTING NINE IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS SO AGAIN I THINK IT JUST IT. IT IS MY BELIEF THE POINT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AND A MORE ROBUST MONEY. AUTUMN AND FOR ME LOOKING AT THE BOAT CENTER MODEL I'M REALLY LOOKING OUT THE CONNECTIVITY TO THESE VOTE CENTERS AND. WE KNOW WE HAVE A HARD ENOUGH TIME AND SOME OF OUR AREAS WE ACTUALLY DO OPERATE ABOUT CENTER WATSONVILLE WHERE THEY DO THE VOTING FOR THE TWENTY NINE DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION. AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY HAVING CONNECTIVITY ISSUES SO YOU KNOW BEING A ROLE COUNTY I CAN IMAGINE SOME THESE. YOU KNOW OFFSITE OF FACILITIES HOW WELL THAT'S GOING TO WORK SO AND JUST KEEPING THE SECURITY AND THE ACCESSIBILITY OF ALL THOSE LOCATIONS AS WELL AND STOPPING. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A NEW PERSON IN THERE EVERY DAY YOU HELP THAT CONSISTENT STOPPING AND TRAINING YOU KNOW AND AND THEN SO HERE'S THE CHING CHING THE MONEY STARTS GOING BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE RESOURCES TO MAYBE HIRE PEOPLE. AND I TRAIN THEM SO THEY KNOW HOW TO USE ALL THE SYSTEMS NOW. OKAY RIGHT WHAT LAST WILL REQUEST IS EARLIER A GRADE ONE PAGER OR VIDEO OR MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GET A BRIEFING ON THE PROCESS BEHIND THE RISK LIMITING AUDIT PROCESS. AND I HAVE A GREAT WHEN I CAN SEND YOU WOULD YOU MIND OF YASSER AYE AYE DOES LOVE TO. BETTER UNDERSTAND. I'D BE HAPPY TO. YEAH BECAUSE WE ARE BABIES WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE'RE SHIFTING. FROM THIS ONE PERCENT ANNUAL TALLY TOWARD THE WRIST LIMITING AUDIT PROCESS. AND I THINK YOU KNOW. THAT I'M. YOU KNOW TRUST YOU GUYS AND AND. I'D WANNA BETTERS IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT I CAN BETTER ANSWER CONSTITUENTS. AS THEY RAISE CONCERNS AND. FEARS ABOUT ANY KIND OF SHIFT IN THIS AREA BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE. YOU KNOW AYE AYE UNDERSTANDABLY NERVOUS JUST GIVEN THE ALTHOUGH THE ATMOSPHERE OUT THERE I'M. I THINK YOU KNOW I I TWENTY DOLLARS AND SYSTEM. IT'S AWESOME SOCCER THAT WE CANNOT PROVIDE YOU LINK THAT THAT THE STATE OF COLORADO THAT JUST DID THE STATEWIDE RECLAIMING NOT AT THAT SECRETARY COULD YOU TALK ABOUT. JUST PUBLISHED A VIDEO. AS WELL IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED A ONE PAGER BUT WE CAN'T HAVE AS WELL OKAY THANK YOU. THEY VERY MUCH IN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SANDOR STERN CHAIR STERN I GOT A COUPLE QUICK ONES. THANK YOU GUYS FOR COMING UP. AND FOR MAKING THE. SLIP ON YOUR OWN DIME ESPECIALLY THAT SPEAKS TO YOUR COMMITMENT TO. THE PUBLIC TRUST IN FOR DINNER WITH YOUR DAUGHTER I. YEAH HOBOS GOOD SHE BETTER PAID IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW. ALL MONDAY IT'S ON MY THAT SHE WAS THERE. EXACTLY. YOU KNOW THE. FUTURE A BIT OF A NINE COUPLE EVEN BACK UP AT MASTERSON'S. COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS FOR YOU ALSO A. MSI SACK ADMISSION MASTERSON BROUGHT THAT UP. WHO? TERMS OF THE CHALLENGES YOU WOULD SEE SIGNING UP FOR THAT IS THAT GONNA BE USEFUL INFORMATION AT A YEAR THERE ARE. YOU'RE ON THE. FORGET THE NAME ZZ THE GCC. SO CHALLENGES ARE EXPEDITIOUSLY SORT OF ENGAGING IN THAT SYSTEM YES SIR SO IT'S IT'S VERY EASY TO SIGN UP IT'S FREE THOSE LIKE THOSE OF THE TWO IMPORTANT POINTS I WANT TO POINT OUT. AND THERE'S USEFUL INFORMATION THE DIFFICULTY I THINK THAT SOME ELECTION OFFICES WILL HAVE HIS SORTING THROUGH THE WHITE NOISE BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT'S THROWN AT YOU. AND I I THINK ONCE YOU FIND THAT BALANCE BETWEEN THE WHITE NOISE AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT IT WILL BE VERY USEFUL FOR FOR ALL ACTION OPS. AND. AND INSERT CENTER BECAUSE YOU HAVE WOMAN PLEASE HERE SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING ON THE GCC IS. DO WE HAVE A. A BRANDED ELECTION ISAK AS OPPOSED TO JUST THE GENERIC MSI SACK AND I AND THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE CONTINUING BECAUSE THAT CAN ALSO HELP. FATAL TO IT AND AND CUT OUT THE WHITE RIGHT BECAUSE MSI SACK IS GONNA HAVE ALL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE RISK INFORMATION KNOW THEY ARE THERE ONLY FORWARDING INFORMATION RELATED TO ELECTIONS WITH A PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THERE'S A LOT OF AND FOR. BECAUSE YOU COULD YOU COULD GET JUST THE GENERAL SCANNING INFORMATION RIGHT RIGHT THAT'S NOT GONNA BE SPECIFIC TO YOUR COUNTY. SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. IT'S ORG PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD SEND OUT TO ELECTIONS OFFICIALS SO THEY CAN ALL JR DEATH THAT YEAH BECAUSE I WAS GONNA SAY WHAT CAN WE DO TO ESPECIALLY TO ENCOURAGE. THE REGISTRARS LIKE THAT GAIL AND AND SMALLER COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS AND HOW BEST PRACTICE SOME FILTERING OUT LIKE YOU'RE SAYING WHITE NOISE ESPECIALLY IF YOU END WHAT MARTIN MARTIN ARE GOING TO BE. THE SOUL WATCHERS ON THE WALL THERE TO BE LOOK AND IT'S A IT'S A LOT TO ASK FOR SO. IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN BE DOING ALSO THE STATE LEVEL TO EITHER ENCOURAGE PUSH TRAIN. WOULD LOVE THAT FEEDBACK BECAUSE WE WANT TO LOOK AFTER THE SMALL COUNTIES TO ABSOLUTE. I THINK THAT THAT TO STATE YEAH PLEASE I KNOW THAT IT IS YEAH ONE TO SAY THAT THAT. I THINK THE SECRETARY STATE. I HAS DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF DISSEMINATING THAT INFORMATION VERY QUICKLY WHEN WHEN THEY GET SO THE COMBINATION OF. NEIL AS A RESOURCE. REPRESENTING LOCAL OFFICIALS AND THE SECRETARY STATE THAT IS HAPPENING I THINK THERE'S THERE'S MORE THAT CAN BE DONE ON THAT AND THEN I THINK TWO TALES FINE IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY IDENTIFYING. WHO ARE THE MARTINS IN ALL THE COUNTY ATTITUDES THAT? BECAUSE IT IS. EVEN IN THIS MONTH SMALL COUNTIES I THINK NOW THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S RESPONSIBLE IF THE CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER AND SAID IT'S. AS IMPORTANT IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT. UP FOR THEM TO GET THAT INFORMATION THAT IS AS IT IS THE REGISTRANT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CASIO COULD COME BACK TO OUR COMMITTEE ON JUST SORT OF LET US KNOW STATUS FOR SIGN UPS IN CHALLENGES AS IT AS IT EVOLVES SO THAT WE DON'T HIT JUNE AND THEN. SO WERE WE WERE SORT OF WONDERING BUT DOING IT SOONER THAN LATER JUST REPORT BACK AND CHECK AND LET US KNOW OKAY. ON THAT NOTE. TERMS OF UTILIZING RESOURCES OUT THERE. MASTERSON BROUGHT UP GOON CLOUD FLARE IN THE DESERT OF FREE TIRE KICKING IF YOU WILL THAT THEY'RE OFFERING. AND I ELISE YOU KNOW SEEING LA YOU GUYS ARE DOING A LOT OF THAT IN HOUSE. BUT. DOES THAT. IN TERMS OF THE THIRD PARTY VALIDATION AND TRYING TO FIND OTHER BRANDS OUT THERE BEYOND GOVERNMENT SAYING THE GOVERNMENT'S DOING A GOOD JOB WHERE THERE'S GOING TO JUST BE INHERENT DISTRUST FROM PEOPLE WHO DON'T TRUST GOVERNMENT PERIOD. EFFICACY IN THAT APPROACH OF WE UTILIZE THAT DO IT TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN ANY. ANY COUNTIES IN THE STATE SO WE WE ARE IN IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR BE SET PROJECT THE BODY SOLUTIONS AND PROJECT IN LA COUNTY WE WILL BRING IN A THIRD PARTY. I'M HACKING GROUP TO TO ACTUALLY ATTEMPT TO HACK THE SYSTEM AND WE THINK AND WE SENT STAFF FROM OUR. A PROJECT TEAM TO THE DEATH CON CONFERENCE IN IN LAS VEGAS WHERE THEY HAD A. VOTING SYSTEM HACKING VILLAGE TIME AND YOU PROBABLY READ ABOUT THAT WHERE WHERE OUR STAFF WATCH TO SEE HOW THE. ANA PENETRATED THAT SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY WORKED ON NOW. WE WANT TO LOOK AT THAT IN PRACTICAL TERMS I MEAN SOME OF SOME OF THAT. IS BEST PREVENTED BY. SECURING THE ACCESS TO THE SYSTEMS AND AND I'M DOING OPERATIONAL THINGS AND THERE ARE OTHER THINGS I AM LOOKING LIKE JUST PERSONNEL NOT GIVING UP THAT PASSWORD TO THEY'RE. NOT DANCING THINKING OF MOVING IN THERE THAT THAT RIGHT. IDEA SO SO WE'RE WE'RE DOING THAT I THINK WE RECOGNIZE. THAT THAT IT ISN'T GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR US TO SAY THAT THAT WE DID THAT IN HOUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE THIRD PARTY VALIDATORS. THAT IS PART OF THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT A THIRD PARTY TESTING. AUTHORITY DOES COME IN AND LOOK AT THE CODE AND AND RUN TEST. A PENETRATION TEST. VOLUME TEST ALL OF THOSE THINGS BEFORE YOU GET THAT SEAL OF APPROVAL TO MOVE FORWARD I THINK THE THAT THE MAIN EMPHASIS IS HOW DO WE CARRY THAT FORWARD SO EVEN AFTER YOU'RE CERTIFIED AFTER YOU IMPLEMENT IT. ESPECIALLY WERE MOVING TO MORE AGILE MODELS WHERE WE CAN UPDATE THAT SYSTEMS ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT THOSE PROTOCOLS ARE IN PLACES. AND LET ME JUST ADD IF I COULD GET HONOR. SO WE ARE PARTNER WITH CAL TECH. STARTING THIS MONTH ACTUALLY ON A NINE MONTH PROJECT. FOR A THIRD PARTY VALIDATION ON WHAT WE'RE DOING ON OUR NETWORKS ARE SYSTEMS VOTER DATABASE. DEAL USE THAT AS BEST PRACTICE FOR OTHER COUNTIES IN THE STATE AND I WOULD JUST ADD GOOGLE'S DOING GREAT WORK. CENTER FOR INTERNET SECURITY IS DOING GREAT WORK BUT THE ACADEMICS ARE ALSO SOMEBODY MENTIONED LOOKING AT FOR THIRD PARTY VALIDATION. AND WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH A THIRD PARTY AS WELL TO DO PENETRATION TESTING IDENTIFY ANY WEAKNESSES. SO HE WOULD BE MY ONE. REQUEST THEN IS THAT. AS YOU GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS LET'S FIND A WAY. YES THERE WE THE CERTIFICATION AT THE END AND YOU'LL GO THROUGH WHATEVER. THIRD PARTY VALIDATION GOING THROUGH BUT PUBLICIZING THAT PROCESS AND LETTING THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT. WE ARE DOING THIS SORT OF WHITE HAT HACKING EXERCISES IN THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS TIRE KICKING PROCESS BEFORE THEY GO TO THE POLLS. THERE'S LET'S FIND SOME WAY TO PUBLICLY COMMUNICATE THAT AND. I I WANT TO. FOLLOW THAT UP THOUGH WITH WE DON'T WANT TO ADD EVEN FURTHER TO YOUR PERSONNEL AND RESOURCE BURDENS ON THAT FRONT SO THE OTHER PART I'D LIKE IS IF WE ARE GOING TO ACCURATELY BE COMMUNICATING BACK TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEING DONE ON DEFENSE WHAT'S BEING SORT OF WHAT'S GOOD INFORMATION. IN ADDITION THAT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION WHICH IS. FOR MINOR SAYING REALLY SOLELY FOCUS ON EQUIPMENT ITSELF ON THE ON THE CAPITAL BUT NOT ON THE. AND AND NOT ON THE PERSONNEL. FEEDBACK ON THAT FRONT WILL BE VERY VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF THERE IS. ONE MORE PERSON. IN THE COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS STUFF OUR PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER SUMMING IT ACTUALLY GET OUT THERE. YEAH I I'M I'M VERY INTERESTED IN IN THAT SO. YEAH ANYWAY HOPE YOU HOPE YOU GUYS WILL TAKE THAT INTO ADVISEMENT. AND WITH THAT AND THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT. CIRCLE A QUICK QUESTIONS. MISTER LOGAN YOU'D COUNT ALLUDED TO. BUT BORN OPEN THIS UP THAT TO EVERYBODY. THEY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR. KIND OF A FIFTY FIFTY MATCH WITH COUNTIES FOR PURCHASING NEW ELECTIONS AND VOTING SYSTEMS AS AS NOT NOT. BEING A AS A GOOD FIRST START BUT NOT BEING ENOUGH. AND SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU ALL IS AND WHAT IS ENOUGH. GO BEYOND VOTING SYSTEMS OTHER CERTAIN OTHER THINGS THAT IT THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE STATE TO SUPPORT COUNTIES ON. MAYBE KEEP A LAUNDRY LIST OF THE TOP TEN. BUT WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU KNOW ALL YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT SO I GET SAD I ADMIT WHEN I WAS PRESIDENT. OF CC GO WAS WORKING CLOSELY THE SECTOR STATES OFFICE IDENTIFYING WHAT WOULD BE THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT NEEDED ACROSS THE STATE. AND THAT NUMBER IS ACTUALLY CLOSER ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT SIMILAR TO THE THE BOND GET ALL THE ANSWER THAT'S CORRECT AND THAT TAKES IN CAPITAL ONLY DOESN'T TAKE AND THEN WRITE DOT THING IN THE TRAINING AND OTHER ADDITIONAL COSTS. OKAY. AND THEN OF COURSE I AM I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR OF FOR INCLUDING THAT THAT AND WE ALSO I THINK A COLLECTIVELY AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE STATE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MANDATES AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT FUNDING THAT. HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY JUST FOR THE NORMAL OPERATION PIECES IS VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGING WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SET ASIDE MONEY TO PROTECT CYBER NAM SO. AND I WOULD JUST THE TWO TWO THINGS THAT THAT I WOULD. ADD TO THAT ONE IS THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND JUST THE EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT ONE OF A THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN. LOS ANGELES IS THAT THIS WAS BASED ON DATA FROM VOTERS AND IT'S BASED ON VOTER BEHAVIOR OF THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT IS BASED ON THAT AS WELL BUT THE REALITY IS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT VOTERS AGAIN EXPECTED WHEN IT'S IMPLEMENTED VOTER THIRD BY AND LARGE CAN EXPECT WHAT THEY. EXPERIENCE ANYMORE SO A PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS WE HAVE TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. OTHERWISE IT WON'T BE SUCCESSFUL WE DON'T REALIZE THE FULL VISION OF THOSE REFORMS JITTER IF WE DON'T DO THAT. SO SO THAT'S THAT'S LIKE A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND AND JUST STAYED. BECAUSE I HAVE TO I FEEL OBLIGATED TO FADE THAT THAT IT IS THOSE OF THOSE MANDATES I MEAN FINALE COUNTY WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO ROLL OUT THIS NEW VOTING SYSTEM AND EVERY OTHER MONTH WE HAVE. SPECIAL VACANCY ELECTIONS THAT THAT ARE BEING PAID FOR THAT ARE BEING SQUEEZED OUT OF OUR OPERATIONAL BUDGET AND HAVE THREE COMING UP IN APRIL. I'M IN A MATTER OF DAYS THE GOVERNOR'S GONNA ANNOUNCE ANOTHER ONE ALL OF WHICH HAVE TO BE MERGED INTO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ELECTION CYCLE WITHOUT ANY FINDINGS AND AND WE'VE A BILL ON THAT THIS YEAR AS WELL. INTRODUCED BY SOMEONE NUMBER CARILLO WHO KNOWS A LOT OF VERY ABOUT ABOUT US ELECTIONS IT SO. YEAH HOPEFULLY WOULD THAT ADDRESSED REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. MISTER KELLY WHAT I COULD MISTER LOGAN YOU MENTIONED YA OUT WC OUT LA COUNTY DEVELOPING ITS OWN. VOTING SYSTEM. AND I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO THIS EARLIER BUT TO WHAT EXTENT. YOU KNOW WILL LA BE CONSIDERING. OR ARE WILLING TO MAKE THAT SYSTEM AVAILABLE FOR USE BY THE JURISDICTIONS AND A HAVE YOU RECEIVEDANY INTEREST FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS THEM I WANT TO USE THE SYSTEM THAT. THAT YOU'RE KIND OF TAILOR MAKING. WE WE CERTAINLY HAVE RECEIVED. OF THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN IT A BOTH WITHIN CALIFORNIAN OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WE ESTABLISHED EARLY ON IN THE PROJECT THAT WE WANTED THAT TO BE. A PART OF A COURT PROCESS IS TO TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART. ON HOW THAT HAPPENS AND. CANDIDLY WE WANT WE WE WE NEED TO BE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT AND LA COUNTY FOR SURE THAT WE GET UP AND RUNNING AND GETS. WE ARE A LONG WAY FROM NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND IT'S IT'S OVERDUE IN LA COUNTY. SO WE WANT TO DO THAT WE ALSO ARE VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN BECOMING A VOTING SYSTEMS VENDOR. RUNNING ELECTIONS IN LA COUNTY IS CHALLENGING. ON IT'S OWN BUT. BUT WE DO WANT TO LOOK AT AT AT LICENSING ABILITY TO TO LICENSE THE THE I. P. THE LICENSE THE SOFTWARE THE DESIGN SPECS FOR THE HARDWARE ARE ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE PUBLICLY OWNED. WE HAVE SOME ABILITY TO CHAIR SHARE THOSE IN WAYS THAT THAT THAT. ARE TYPICALLY AVAILABLE AND WE'D LIKE TO TO MAXIMIZE THOSE ALSO ALL THE DATA AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT'S GONE IN THAT THAT. THE FOCUS GROUPS AND WORK WITH VOTERS THAT IS ALREADY AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE IS AVAILABLE. TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO USE THAT TO IT TO SUPPORT. ANY KIND OF SIMILAR EFFORT THERE AND GREAT. AND MISTER KELLY A THAT AS A MEMBER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S ELECTIONS INFRASTRUCTURE GOVERNING COORDINATING COUNCIL. WHAT'S YOUR SENSE ABOUT HOW SERIOUSLY DHS IS TAKING ITS RESPONSIBILITIES TO HELP. PROTECT ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY THERE HAVE BEEN. A NUMBER OF. IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE WE FORMED. AND I THINK THE RISK UP THE SCHISM AT FIRST ERA AS TO DHS IS COMMITMENT TO THOSE. BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM THE LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP ALL THE WAY DOWN A IT'S VERY CLEAR THEY'VE TAKEN A VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY GOOD HERE VERSION OF THAT. ALL RIGHT I THINK ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. NOW WE'RE ON THE FORTY FIVE MINUTES BEHIND. IT'S A GREAT. JOB CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE IT. ART IS MY DISTINCT HONOR TO WELCOME OUR LAST SAID OF. STING WAS PAINLESS TO THE. THE TABLE HERE ANDREW GROTTO AND PAMELA SMITH. GUYS WANNA COME UP AND TAKE SEE WELCOME MR GROTTO. MISS SMITH. JUST FOR A QUICK INTRODUCTION FOR A MEMBERS HERE. INTEGRATE AS. WILLIAM J. PERRY INTERNATIONAL SECURITY FELLOW AT THE CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN A RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE HOOVER INSTITUTION BOTH AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR WORK AT CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY COOPERATION EARLIER. A BEFORE STANFORD PRESERVATIVE WAS A SENIOR DIRECTOR CYBERSECURITY POLICY THE WHITE HOUSE AND BOTH THE OBAMA AND TRUMP ADMINISTRATIONS. BUT A KEY ROLE IN SHAPING PRESENT OBAMA CYBERSECURITY NATIONAL ACTION PLAN IS ALSO THE PRINCIPAL ARCHITECT. OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CYBERSECURITY EXECUTIVE ORDER STRENGTHENING THE CYBERSECURITY FEDERAL NETWORKS AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO JOINING US ON THIS PANEL IS MISS PAMELA SMITH A SENIOR ADVISER TO VERIFIED VOTING AN ORGANIZATION. WHICH IS SERVED AS PRESIDENT FOR TEN YEARS. SHE PROVIDES INFORMATION. ON VERIFIED VOTING ISSUES BOTH TO US HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES. ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION AND VARIOUS OTHER BODIES SHOULD AUTHOR OF. A SEVERAL A KEY PUBLICATIONS ON ELECTION SECURITY AND IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA LECTIONIS NETWORK AND MEMBER OF THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTING'S. VOTING SOLUTIONS FOR ALL PEOPLE PROJECT THAT REGISTRAR LOGIN JUST. MENTION SO THANK YOU BOTH FOR GOING AND I WILL LET YOU HAVE IT OUT AS TO WHO GOES FIRST. PLEASE MR GRETA WELCOME GREAT WELL I THINK YOU CHAIRMAN STERN AND CHAIRMAN BERMAN FOR FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR. YOUR TIME ATTENTION THIS MORNING. PRESERVING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTORAL INFRASTRUCTUREIS OBVIOUSLY VITAL TO ORGANIZE. AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT AMERICAN AND IS A NEW WE ARE RE REGISTER CALIFORNIA VOTER FOR YOUR. A FOCUS ON THIS TOPIC. BUT NORMALLY INTEREST IN OUR LIKE TOOL INFRASTRUCTURE P. IN EVEN NUMBERED YEARS ONLY TO FADE. ARE IN ODD NUMBERED YEARS AS OUR ATTENTION AS A NATION. TWO OTHER PRIORITIES. THIS WAS THE CASE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HOWEVER. AS RESOLVED IMPORTANT WORK DONE BY ELECTION PROFESSIONALS CIVIL SOCIETY AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. I DO HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA AT THIS POINT AFTER WHAT CYBERSECURITY BEST PRACTICES LOOK LIKE FOR ELECTORAL AT FIRST. THAT WASN'T THE CASE I THINK IN TWO THOUSAND TINA MY S.. SO I BELIEVE THAT THE KEY QUESTION IS KEY CYBERSECURITY QUESTIONS BUT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ELECTION CYCLE. NOT REVOLVE AROUND IMPLEMENTATION. AN INCIDENT RESPONSE INCLUDING PUBLIC. AND DO STATE LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS HAVE SUFFICIENT MANAGEMENT STAFF AND BUDGET RESOURCES. IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICE. AND ARE AND SINCE I INCIDENTS CAN STILL HAPPEN EVEN WHEN. ON BEST PRACTICES ARE IMPLEMENTED PERFECTLY A. OUR CONTINGENCY PLANS A CALIBRATED FOR THE CHANCE I HAD. DO YOU RECEIVE A LOT INFORMATION ALREADY THIS MORNING FROM OUR STATE'S ELECTION PROFESSIONALS ABOUT THEIR COGNIZANCE OF SECRETARY BEST PRACTICES. AND THE READING THAT SUCH CONDUCT CYBERSECURITY ACTION THIS FALL ON THE FOCUS WAS UNDERSTANDABLY ON. A WHAT THESE ELECTION PROFESSIONALS ARE DOING TO ENSURE THAT ELECTION OUTCOMES IN NOVEMBER REFLECT WILL THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE. ABOUT WHAT I WANNA PRIMARILY EMPHASIZE IN MY REPAIRED REMARKS TODAY IS THE EQUALLY VITAL ROLE THAT CANDIDATES FOR PUBLIC OFFICE I MUST PLAY A HOLDING THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN OUR ELECTORAL AT FIRST. YOU TWO ARE THE FRONT LINES OF COMBAT INSIDE RISKS TO ELECTORAL. A PROVIDES PERSPECTIVE AND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE. ATTRIBUTE OF THE FIGHT. BUT FOR CONTEXT I BEGIN WITH A BRIEF REMINDER OF THE THREAT OR FACE NITTANY. I IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IS IS AS YOU ALL KNOW THE U. S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ISSUED AN UNCLASSIFIED REPORT ON RUSSIA'S INTERFERENCE NO ELECTION PROCESS AND I QUOTE. WE ASSESSED WITH HIGH CONFIDENCE THAT RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. ORDERING INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN U. S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THE CONSISTENT GOALS OF WHICH WOULD UNDERMINE PUBLIC FAITH IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. THEN IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. CIA DIRECTOR MIKE PAPALEO A SAID HE EXPECTED RUSSIA TO INTERFERE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ELECTION. AS PART OF THE KREMLIN'S STRATEGY TO QUOTE UNDERMINE WESTERN DEMOCRACY. HOW WILL THE KREMLIN ATTEMPTED? THROUGH SO CALLED ACTIVE MEASURES. ACTIVE MEASURES IS THE ENGLISH TERM FOR RUSSIA'S DOCTRINE OF INFORMATION WARFARE A COMBINED HACKING. A WITH INFORMATION OPERATIONS AND AND AND OTHER. ACTIONS OUGHT TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF RUSSIA'S CAPABILITIES IN THIS AREA. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS. RUSSIA CONDUCTED. INFILTRATION AGAINST. UKRAINE'S CENTRAL ELECTION ADMINISTRATION. THEY DELETED FILES AND HEADS AND AND ATTEMPT TO INSTALL MALWARE THE WHAT CHANGED OUR VOTES. I IN SUPPORT OF ULTRA RIGHT WING NATIONALIST PARTY. THE WHO. WHO SERVICE CONVENIENT FOIL FOR RUSSIA'S? IT A PROPAGANDA THAT BUT UKRAINE SPA AND FASCISM. UNFORTUNATELY. UKRAINE'S LOOKING PROFESSIONALS DISCOVERED THIS AND STOP HAPPY THAT DIDN'T STOP. RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA AND ITS OVERALL DISINFORMATION APPARATUS IN SPREADING FALSE NARRATIVE THAT IN FACT THESE ULTRA NATIONALISTS. THE EFFECT WAS TO SORT OUT UKRAINE ABOUT INTEGRITY THEIR ELECTION. REGIONAL AND GLOBAL. AND ISSUED UNDER MY. I THINGS EXPECT RUSSIA TO INUSE ACTIVE MEASURES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I THINK. THERE WERE MEASURES WILL BE AIMED AT FEW FEEDING CORROSIVE NARRATIVES ABOUT ELECTION FRAUD ABOUT MILES TO POLLING PLACES ABOUT LONG LINES AND OTHER IRREGULARITIES A BEFORE AND DURING ELECTION. NOW NOTICE HOW THE SUCCESS OF THE KREMLIN'S STRATEGY DOESN'T NECESSARILY DEPEND ON ANY ACTUAL HACKS IRREGULAR. OF THE KREMLIN WINS BY SLOWING DOWN. I WISH YOU TO CUT IT WOULD ACCOMPLISH ABOUT MAKE IT HARD FOR US TO DISCERN GROUND TRUTH I TO SEPARATE FACT FROM TO SUPERMAN. DOUBT IS CORROSIVE TO. THAT OBSERVATION TAKES ME THE FIRST OF THE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE. GIVEN THIS THREAT IT IS VITAL THAT ARE WATCHING PROFESSIONALS PRACTICE THEIR CYBERSECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE PLANS BEFORE NOVEMBER THROUGH THROUGH EXERCISE. I KNOW THE CONTINGENCY PLANNING IS ALREADY PART THE DNA OF OUR ELECTION PROFESSIONALS. BUT IN THIS CONTEXT IT YOU KNOW MY IN MY VIEW IS THAT IT NEEDS TO FOCUS YET READY TO FOCUS ON TWO GOALS ONE OBVIOUSLY MAKING SURE THAT THAT THE ELECTION RESULTS REFLECT WILL BE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE. BUT ALSO UPHOLDING CONFIDENCE IN THE OUTCOME IT'S POSSIBLE TO CERTIFY ELECTION OUTCOME AND STILL LOSE THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE THAT THE ELECTION HAPPENED. BUT THE WAY THAT THAT. WE WOULD EXPECT IT TO. ARE THESE EXERCISES DON'T NEED TO BE ALLOWED AFFAIRS UP DID YOU NEED TO BE REPLACED ENOUGH TO HELP OUR PROFESSIONALS TEST OTHER TECHNICAL RESPONSE PLANS AND VITALLY THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS. ARE THESE EXERCISES WILL HELP IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE PROBLEMS I GENERAL MAIL THEM TO BUILD SOME MUSCLE MEMORY AROUND HOW DOES NOT RESPOND TO CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS REGARDLESS A PERPETRATOR INCLUDING. ANY ACTIVE MEASURES THEY MAY EMANATE FROM. THAT'S WHAT WAS RECOMMENDED. MY SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THOSE OF YOU RUNNING FOR REELECTION DEVELOP YOUR OWN. PLANS TO PURPORTED. CYBER SCREENS. THE TWITTER MEME ABOUT HACKED E. POLL BOOKING OR DISTRICT STARTS TO DEVELOP ON ELECTION DAY. STORIES ABOUT VIOLENT PROTESTS AT A POLLING PLACE SHOW UP IN FACEBOOK NEWSFEEDS HOW YOUR YOUR TEAM SPOT. HOOSIER TEAM CALLED THE FIRST INSTANCE FOR GROUND. A WHAT DO DILLON IS APPROPRIATE A BEFORE MAKING. I SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER THE INTERSECTION OF POLITICS AND POLICY. AND POST IT IN POLICY SO I FULLY APPRECIATE THE RELENTLESS. AT NEW CYCLE AND HOW INTENSE CAMPAIGNS CAN BE A THAT SAID DON'T ALLOW YOU YOUR CAMPAIGN TO BE CAUGHT BY THE KREMLIN IS PART OF AN ACTIVE. MY ADVICE IS TO DEVELOP INSTANT RESPONSE YOUR OWN INCIDENT RESPONSE PLANS IN ADVANCE PRACTICE. IDEALLY DEVELOPMENT COORDINATION WITH WITHOUT ELECTION OFFICIALS WHO WHO ARE YOU FOR FROM TODAY AND BY THE WAY TO MANAGE YOUR OPPONENTS TO THE SAME. BOB DON'T STOP THEIR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS ARE ARE VITAL ELECTORAL INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL BY DIFFERENT OF COURSE THAN. THE INFRASTRUCTURE ADMINISTERED BY STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT IMPORTANT IN THE LAST. I CAMPAIGNS MUST ALSO INFLUENCE ARE RISKY BEST PRACTICES TO PROTECT THEIR SYSTEMS AND IT WILL COMPROMISE. IT STARTS WITH CREATING A CULTURE. SECURITY AND AND BUILDING FROM THERE. WHAT CLOSE WITH A THIRD RECOMMENDATION A TOPIC IT'S A BIT MORE FUTURE ORIENTED BUT I THINK I ACTION MUST BUS START NOW? PICKED UP ON SENATOR STEARNS APPOINT A OPENING COMMENTS WHERE HE DESCRIBED ELECTORAL SYSTEM AS THE BONES OF OUR DEMOCRACY. CIVIC DISCOURSE I WOULD ARGUE IS THE SOLE. AREN'T WE PARTY SCENE THE TOXIC IMPACT THE FAKE NEWS CAN HAVE. AND THE FORM OF DOCTORED PHOTOS AND MEET UP TAXED ON OUR CIVIL DISORDER CIVIC. OF MY STAFF RECALL THE DAMPENING AYE DOCUMENT FORTHCOMING PAPER WHAT'S COMING NEXT IS FAKE VIDEO A SO CALLED DEEP FAKES ARE THAT USE MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES TO GENERATE SPOOKED VIDEOS. BUT THESE VIDEOS CAN DEPICT A PERSON SAYING AND DOING WHAT EVER THE AUTHOR THE VIDEO DOESN'T DESIRES WITH POTENTIALLY BREATHTAKING REALISM. BUT YOU MAY SEE SOME EXAMPLES OF DEEP FIX ALREADY OTHER ALREADY IMPRESSIVELY PERSUASIVE AND SOON IT WILL BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. DISTINGUISHED FAKE VIDEO FROM A REAL ONE. OTHER MANY MOST APPLICATIONS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY BUT WE'RE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED BUT MISUSED IN ELECTION CAMPAIGNS TO MAKE IT EVEN HARDER FOR AMERICANS TO SEPARATE FACT WITH APPLICATION. AND LEARN TRUTHS ABOUT CANDIDATES AND ISSUES. NOW COMPANIES SUCH AS FACEBOOK AND TWITTER HAVE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PREVENT THE PLATFORMS I'M FOR BEING ABUSED SPREAD ALMOST STEEP TAKES WHICH HOLDEN TO A HIGH STANDARD. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS KNOW TECHNOLOGICAL OR REGULATORY SO REPORT. WE MUST ALSO LOOK TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO RUN FOR OFFICE HOLD LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN OUR POLITICAL INSTITUTE IT'S FOR LEADERSHIP. THE RISK OF THE RISK OF MISUSE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. IN AN ELECTORAL CONTEXT IS AS MUCH A FUNCTION OF WHAT OUR POLITICAL LEADERS CONSIDER TO BE APPROPRIATE NORMS BEHAVIOR. AS IT IS A FUNCTION OF WHAT TECHNOLOGY CAN DO. BOB PUT DIFFERENTLY EXCLUSIVE FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS IGNORES THE KEY ROLE THE CANDIDATES FOR. AND THEY'RE FOR ALLIES PLAY IN SETTING ENFORCING A BREAKING OF CONDUCT IN OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE CANDIDATES NEED TO JOIN THE FIGHT. A FOR THAT REASON I BELIEVE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF MANAGING THE RISK THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY POSES TOWARD DEMOCRACY IS FOR LEADERS TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR NORMAL RESTRAINT. AROUND I WHICH LEADS TO MY THIRD AND FINAL RECOMMENDATION. CANDIDATES IN THE FORMAL CAMPAIGN INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING THE NATIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES SHOULD MUTUALLY AGREED TO NOT PRODUCE PROMOTER OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTE A FAKE VIDEO. TO PICKING A PERSON WITHOUT THAT PERSON. OUR THEY SHOULD ALSO SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE THEIR ALLIES AND PROXIES THAT THEY SHOULD OUT OF USES TECHNOLOGY EITHER AND ENERGETICALLY CALL UP GROUPS IT FIGHTS. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS I LOOK FORWARD YEAR OF QUESTIONS I HOPE WE CAN HAVE A WIDE RANGING HALF. FIGURE MUCH CHRIS SMITH. THANK YOU. A CHAIRED BERMAN CHAIR STERN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. TODAY I'M HONORED BY THAT. IN MY APACITY IT VERIFIED VOTING I'VE WORKED WITH ADVOCATES AND ELECTION OFFICIALS ON LAWMAKERS FROM ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN YOU EVALUATE HOW STATES ARE DOING ON METRICS THAT RELATE TO SECURITY SOME DO BETTER THAN OTHERS. AND THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND THE ONES THAT EMBRACE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE ARE THE ONES THAT DO THE BEST. SO THEREFORE I'M GRATEFUL FOR THIS CHANCE TO SHARE ON THIS TOPIC AND THAT YOU'RE HAVING THIS HEARING. AND BY THE WAY I TOLD MATT MASTERSON NOT TO TAKE ALL MY BEST LINES BUT I THINK YOU CAN LISTEN SO YOU MAY HEAR. SOMETHING ECHOED IN WHAT I SAY I'M JUST A FRAME UP YOU KNOW I LOOK AT SECURITY AT ALL SECURITY ELECTIONS THROUGH THE FILTER OF HOW WILL THIS AFFECT. THE ABILITY OF VOTERS TO CAST AN EFFECTIVE BALLOT. AND EFFECTIVE BALLOT THE IN THE BALLOTS AVAILABLE TO THEM THEY'RE NOT TRIPPED UP BY A FAILED ELECTRONIC PULL BOOKER TAMPERED REGISTRATION LIST THAT THEY GET THE CORRECT BALLOT IT'S PRESENTED COMPLETED IT'S FEASIBLE TO MARK. CHECK VERIFY CAST IT SAFELY AND PRIVATELY AND THAT IT'S COUNTED CORRECTLY ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER BALLOTS. AND THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT FACT. TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE PUBLIC INCLUDING THOSE ON THE SIDE OF LOSING CANDIDATES OR ISSUES. VOTERS NEED TO KNOW THAT ELECTIONS ARE WORKING THE WAY THAT THEY SHOULD OR ELSE THEY WON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE TO ENGAGE IN NOTHING SADDER THAN THROWING A PARTY AND NOBODY SHOWS UP SO. THERE OBSTACLES TO VOTING OF MANY KINDS THERE ARE MANY GROUPS THAT WORK HARD TO REMOVE SOME OF THOSE OBSTACLES AND HELP VOTERS ENGAGE INCLUDING OUR FRONTLINE OF THE ELECTION OFFICIAL COMMUNITY. BY ENSURING THAT VOTERS KNOW WE'RE TAKING ALL POSSIBLE STEPS ON SECURITY WE'RE REMOVING THE OBSTACLE OF LACK OF CONFIDENCE. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SECOND THING TO EMPHASIZE IN CYBERSECURITY ISSUES IN PARTICULAR PREVENTION AND DETECTION OF TAMPERING IN BREACH IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT FOR ELECTION OUTCOMES AND ENSURING THAT. THE VOTERS WHO SHOW UP CAN CAST AN EFFECTIVE BALLOT WHAT'S CRITICAL IS THE ABILITY TO RECOVER. BOTH REAL TIME AFTER THE FACT AS COMMISSIONER MASTERSON REFERENCED EVEN IF THERE IS A BREACH EVEN IF THERE WAS TAMPERING. EVEN IF SOME SYSTEMS FAILED OR CAUSE TO FAIL ON ELECTION DAY THAT PEOPLE CAN STILL VOTE. AND THAT THEIR VOTES ARE STILL COUNTED CORRECTLY. WE GO TO ELECTIONS WITH THE SYSTEMS WE HAVE THEIR ELECTIONS ALL THE TIME THEY'RE ALL IMPORTANT NEW STANDARDS THAT WE SAT. THOUGH GOOD ARE NOT RETROACTIVELY APPLIED SO WE HAVE TO HAVE STRATEGIES FOR RECOVERY NO MATTER WHAT. AND SECURITY IS NOT AN ON OFF YES NO THING ITS LAYERS. THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER VULNERABILITY TO BE FOUND. AND IF WE SAY OUR SYSTEMS ARE SECURE IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE PAINTING A TARGET ON YOUR BACK. INCREMENTAL SECURITY MEASURES CAN HARDEN TO MAKE A SYSTEM MORE SECURE THAN IT WAS BEFORE AND WE SHOULD TAKE THOSE MEASURES. WE SHOULD MAKE IT EASY FOR TAMPERING TO OCCUR. BUT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE INCREASINGLY SAVVY PUBLIC ALREADY KNOWS THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS TAMPER PROOF. BUT WE CAN SAY WE TAKE THE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY THE OUTCOME. AND THAT EVERYBODY WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE WAS ABLE TO DO SO. IT'S NOT PERFECTION IT'S DILIGENCE. IN THAT LIGHT I WOULD SAY THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS CALIFORNIA DOES WELL AND HAS DONE WELL OVER TIME. COMPARING WITH ALL THE STATE'S CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF LIFTING UP THE ISSUE OF SECURITY. WE'VE BEEN A LEADER IN THIS SPACE AND I THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO LEAD. OUR SECRETARIES OF STATE OVER A NUMBER OF. ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE DONE THINGS LIKE REQUIRING AUDITABLE SYSTEMS REQUIRING BACKUP PAPER BALLOTS CALLING FOR AUDITABLE. A SYSTEMS BEFORE MOST OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY OF VOLUME TESTING FOR CERTIFICATION NEW AND IMPROVED CERTIFICATION. TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW OF VOTING SYSTEMS INCLUDING ON ACCESSIBILITY INCLUDING A PARALLEL EFFORT A TASK FORCE ON POST ELECTION AUDITING WHICH. RECOMMENDED. RESPONDING AUDITS. WE'VE DONE SO MANY THINGS THAT HAVE REALLY HELPED TO THEN MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR COUNTIES LIKE LA AND. SAN FRANCISCO DID STEP UP AND DEVELOP. MORE SECURE SYSTEMS THAT MEET TODAY'S VOTERS NEEDS. THEN WE'VE PILOTED THE AT RISK LIMITING AUDITS IN A NUMBER OF COUNTY STARTING BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. WE ALSO A PROHIBIT A CONNECTION TO THE INTERNET WITH ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION THE FAX RETURN A VOTED BALLOTS. OF FOR SOME VOTERS AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL CALIFORNIA HAS UNDERSTOOD OVER THE YEARS BETTER THAN A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO LET THE PUBLIC OBSERVE ALL PHASES OF THE ELECTION PROCESS THAT THAT'S A. MAJOR TRUST BUILDER. WHAT CAN CALIFORNIA DO BETTER? IT'S BEEN TOUCHED ON BETTER AUDITING. RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT SOUND AUDITS WHICH THE PUBLIC CAN OBSERVE HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON VOTER CONFIDENCE BUT WE NEED TO PROVIDE MUCH MORE AUTHORITATIVE CONFIRMATION. ABOUT THE CORRECTNESS IN THE OF THE VOTE ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT. PUT ANOTHER WAY WE SHOULD REDUCE THE RISK OF CONFIRMING AN INCORRECT DOT COM SO THAT'S WHAT RISK RUINING AUDITS ARE ALL ABOUT. AND I DON'T THINK EVERYONE WILL AGREE BUT THE RECENT CHANGES THROUGH AB EIGHT FORTY TO THE ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY HAVE FURTHER WEAKENED IT. IT CAN STILL ACCOMPLISH SOME USEFUL THINGS BUT IT DOESN'T CONFIRM ELECTION OUTCOMES ARE CORRECT. OF COURSE IT DOESN'T LIVE BY ITSELF AS THE ONLY MEANS FOR CHECKING AS GIL PELERIN REFERENCED WE HAVE RELATIVELY EASY TO OBTAIN RECOUNTS IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH ARE ALSO OBSERVE. NONE THE LESS EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO ADOPT RISK LIVING GODDESS IN CALIFORNIA AND. THOSE EFFORTS CAN'T HAPPEN SOON ENOUGH WE'RE WE HAVE CHALLENGES WITH OLDER EQUIPMENT THAT MAYBE DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO GRANULAR BALLOT LEVEL VERY EFFICIENT RISK LIMITING AUDITS WE CAN DO SOMETHING CALLED BALLOT POLLING AUDITS IT'S ANOTHER KIND. OF RISK LIMITING AUDIT. AND. THAT CAN BE DONE WITH COUNTIES A CROSS COUNTY BORDER CONTESTS. AND STATEWIDE CONTESTS WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE EFFORT. WHERE QUITMAN PERMITS OR AS WE ADOPT NEW EQUIPMENT THAT DOES PERMIT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY DO FULL RISK LIMITING AUDITS AND I AGREE WITH MILT KELLY ON THE SUGGESTED TO AUDIT VOTER REGISTRATION DATA BASES AS WELL? THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION I WOULD HAVE WOULD BE TO LIMIT OR EVEN ELIMINATE ELECTRONIC RETURN OF VOTED BALLOTS WE HAVE TO BETTER SERVE OUR MILITARY AND OVERSEAS VOTERS PRIVACY AND SECURITY. AND WHILE WE LIMIT OUR ELECTRONIC RETURN IN THIS STATE TO FAX MOST FAXES DONE OVER THE INTERNET TODAY. AND HAS THE SAME VULNERABILITIES AS OTHER KINDS OF ELECTRONIC RETURN MATH IT'S IT'S A BIG TARGET. WE COULD POTENTIALLY ADD MORE TIME FOR LATE ARRIVING MILITARY BALLOTS AND EXPAND THE USE OF TRACKING EXPRESSED LABELS AND OTHER. UP PRACTICES LIKE THAT THE THIRD THING AND I THINK. WE'VE WE'VE SORT OF BEEN. DANCING AROUND THE EDGES OF THIS BUT I THINK WE SHOULD FORM ELECTION SECURITY ADVISORY COUNCIL. SIMILAR TO THE LANGUAGE ACCESS ADVISORY COUNCIL OR THE VOTING ACCESSIBILITY ADVISORY COUNCILS THAT EXIST A SOUNDING BOARD OF TALENTED EXPERTS FROM OUR MANY UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY HUBS. SECRETARY PRETTY A MATCH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND OTHERS. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP BOLSTER THE INSIDE TALENT THAT ALREADY EXISTS AT THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY AND AND AMONG THE COUNTIES. IT SPEAKS TO WHAT NEIL KELLY SAID ABOUT USING ACADEMICS AS THIRD PARTY VALIDATORS AND RESOURCES AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. OF THE EFFORTS OF THE STATE TO SPONSOR CYBERSECURITY TRAINING FOR COUNTIES AND WE WOULD SUPPORT GATHERINGS OF THE COUNTY'S IT EXPERTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT ARE ALREADY WORKING IN THE COUNTY SO THAT THEY CAN. SHARE THEIR BEST PRACTICES AND INSIGHTS MORE READILY. ALONG THESE LINES LOS ANGELES HAS HAD A TECHNICAL ADVISER GROUP. INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT F THEIR NEW VOTING SYSTEM FROM THE BEGINNING A PROCESS AND IT'S BEEN REALLY WORTHWHILE OR ELSE DEAN WOULD HAVE DID STE DISBANDED US ALREADY. AND I WOULD ADD THAT COLORADO'S RISK LOOT RISK LIMITING AUDIT IMPLEMENTATION WAS SUCCESSFUL IN NO SMALL PART BECAUSE OF A. SLIGHTLY ON SONG BUT TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT AND COLLABORATION THAT WENT INTO HAMMERING OUT ALL THE DETAILS OF PROTOCOLS OF HOW TO DO IT. AT A VERY GRANULAR LEVEL THOUSANDS OF PERSON HOURS WERE DONATED. TO THAT EFFORT AND MADE IT ARE MUCH MORE FEASIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL. AT LEAST ONE OF THE EXPERTS WHO VOLUNTEERED REALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFORT OF IS THE NATION'S LEADING EXPERT ON AUDITING LIVES RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE CAN DO THIS. AND I THINK MY FOURTH RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE IT'S PROBABLY NOW UP BY NOW KIND OF OBVIOUS BUT I'LL SAY IT HIGHER MATT MASTERSON. A NO I MEAN FULL FUNDING FOR ELECTION OFFICIALS TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO SAFEGUARD THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE VOTE. AND THE VOTER REGISTRATION ROLLS FUNDING FOR ELECTION MANDATES NEEDS TO BE RESTORED IN THE STATE BUDGET SUCH THAT THE STATE IS A PARTNER TO THE COUNTIES AS THE SECRETARY SAID. I'LL CLOSE BY SAYING THERE'S REALLY BEEN A SEA CHANGE IN THINKING ON ELECTION SECURITY. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE OVERT ATTACKS ON OUR DEMOCRACY AND WE'RE EVEN USING A WHOLE NEW LANGUAGE OR VOCABULARY ON CYBERSECURITY TODAY. WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT LEAPS FORWARD IN LEARNING AND BEST PRACTICES FOR HOW TO ADDRESS WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A THREAT BUT IS NOW NO LONGER THEORETICAL IN NATURE. I MORE THAN GRATIFIED THAT THIS HEARING HAS BEEN HELD TODAY AND TO HAVE BEEN A PART OF IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SMITH. MEMBERS QUESTIONS. I JUST A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS ONE. WHICH MEANS TONY GO WITH. NOW WITH THIS ONE AND FROM IS SMITH FOR SOLVE THANK YOU BOTH OF FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY REALLY APPRECIATE IT OBVIOUSLY FOR. ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE OVER OVER MANY YEARS ON THIS ISSUE WHICH IS A MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER. NOT AT TIMES THERE ARE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN LOOKING SECURITY AND ELECTION ACCESSIBILITY. FOR EXAMPLE MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE IN AND YOU ALLUDED TO THIS. MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR YOUR VOTE OVER THE INTERNET CAN BE GREAT FOR ELECTION ACCESSIBILITY BOARD HAVE VERY A LARGE AND THEN POSSIBLY INSURMOUNTABLE SECURITY CHALLENGES. AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN ADVOCACY IN THIS POLICY AREA FOR A LONG TIME. DO YOU HAVE ANY DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO NAVIGATE THOSE TYPES OF TRADE OFFS BETWEEN ACCESSIBILITY AND SECURITY. I IN ALLOCATION SYSTEMS. WELL I THINK THEIR FIRST THING TO DO IS TO. NOT THINK THAT WE CAN'T HAVE IT ALL. YOU KNOW THE THE PROCESS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS BEEN A CONSTANT. OPEN DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE ISSUES ARE AND HOW DO WE RESOLVE THEM SO THAT WE HAVE MAXIMUM ACCESSIBILITY AND A SECURE SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT. A. YOU KNOW KNOCK WOOD BUT IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL SEE ME. I WAS A VERY PLEASED TO WORK ON A PROJECT WITH THE CENTER FOR CIVIC DESIGN AND OTHERS. ON RISK ON REMOTE ACCESSIBLE BALLOT MARKETING. YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO MARKING OR CASTING BALLOTS OVER THE INTERNET THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE HOW DO YOU SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IT IT CAN BRING BENEFITS BECAUSE OF HOW THE TECHNOLOGY. IT BECAUSE OF ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY THAT VOTERS MAY HAVE IN THEIR OWN HOMES. AND THAT CAN FACILITATE THE PROCESS GREATLY. BUT ISN'T IT. POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT HAVING TO EXPOSE THOSE THAT THE VOTERS PRIVACY AND THE SECURITY OF THEIR CHOICES. AND SO WE WORKED ON THAT AND I'M REALLY GRATIFIED TO SAY THAT THE PRINCIPLES AND BEST PRACTICES THAT WE CAME UP WITH IN COLLABORATION WITH. NATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND AND MANY OTHER ADVOCATES. WERE UP PUT FORWARD TO. THE TGC AND. BY NO STE AND. HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA AS PART OF HOW WE DO REMOTE ACCESS WILL BALLOT MARKING FOR US BEFORE FIFTY. SO IT CAN BE DONE AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE WE MAY GET THERE WE MIGHT NOT GET THERE IN MY LIFETIME AS FAR AS INTERNET VOTING IS CONCERNED. BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS WE CAN DO THINGS TODAY. THAT THAT GIVE US BOTH OR IS AS MUCH A BOTH AS WE CAN HAVE. THANK YOU. I HAD A BRIEF JUST A BRIEF BUT NOT ON THAT WHICH I THINK IT YOU KNOW THAT TO ME SECURITY ENABLES ACCESSIBILITY RIGHT. I THINK VIEW LOOKING AT THAT THAT THAT THAT THE ISSUE FROM THAT PROSPECTIVE I THINK GETS IT. DOT GETS THE POINT THAT WE REALLY SHOULD BE ABLE TO. PEOPLE GET. THANK YOU. AND MISTER GRASSO. OR THIS ONE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A HIGH LEVEL ROLES DOING WHATEVER SECURITY ISSUES IN BOTH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THE DESIGNATION OF ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE. AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WAS MADE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REAFFIRMED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THE DESIGNATION WILL AID IN IMPROVING ELECTION IN FOR SECTION INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY. AND YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHETHER THE COMMITMENT TO THE DESIGNATION HAS CHANGED AT ALL WITH A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION. YEAH I THINK MATT MASTERSON'S COMMENTS RESPOND. YOU KNOW AND AND SOME OF THE OTHER ELECTION PROFESSIONALS THAT THAT THE DHS IS REALLY COMMITTED TO. MAKING SURE THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S AVAILABLE AS A RESOURCE FOR ELECTION OFFICIALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU A DAY IN AND MATT MENTIONED I THINK. YET THAT THE BENEFITS FROM INFORMATION SHARING PROSPECTIVE OF OF A CRITICAL DISTRICT DESIGNATION I WOULD ADD. ANOTHER ONE WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW. DESIGNATING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE% IS CRITICAL SENDS A SIGNAL TO. BOTH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT WOULD SEEK TO. HOLD US AT RISK THAT. WE ATTACH HIGH INSIGNIFICANCE. IT. PUTS US IN A POSITION TO POTENTIALLY ENACT SANCTIONS ON. CERTAIN WISHES ACTORS UNDER OTHER TREASURE DEPARTMENTS THAT OFFERS ONE ASKS CONTROL OCTOPUS SANCTIONS AUTHORITY. BOMBS A DESERT THERE'S A THERE'S A STRATEGIC. FOREIGN POLICY NATIONAL SECURITY OVERLY TO THIS IS. THANK YOU. ONE LAST QUESTION LAST YEAR'S EVERY UNIVERSITY HAS ITS THIRD ANNUAL CYBER BOOT CAMP. UP FOR CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS AS YOU TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY FROM THE TWENTY FOURTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. A JUST THING AND THAT. JUST. AND PROGRESS NOT THEY NEVER LET ME AND BUT YOU KNOW I'LL ADD THAT VERIFIED VOTING WAS FOUNDED BY PROFESSOR FROM STANFORD ALL THERE YOU GO. IS IT IS A LOVE FEST TWENTY FOUR THEY LOVE. YET. ANYBODY CAL TOO SO YEAH. SOME OF THE TOPICS DISCUSSED AT THAT BOOT CAMP WERE WIDE OFFENSES HARDER THAN CYBER OFFENSE AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF APPLYING EXISTING LA TO ACCELERATING TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS ON THE WE STRUGGLE WITH EVERYDAY. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THOSE PRINCIPLES WITH RESPECT TO ELECTION SECURITY YEAH I THINK YOU KNOW THAT I THINK IT I MEAN THAT THE CHALLENGE THAT. ARE LIKE PROFESSIONALS HAVE TO FACE IS IMAGINE IS A PHYSICAL WORLD NOW TO TRY TO MAKE THIS WORKS OBSERVE BEAR WITH ME HERE MATH TEST TESTS ON YOU GUYS. SO IMAGINE. YOU KNOW A THAT INSTEAD OF DEFENDING VOTING SYSTEMS BY THIRD WERE WERE DEFENDING A A STEEP. RIGHT. AND YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE JUST BASED ON. THE RATE OF OWN ABILITIES AND SOFTWARE AND JUST YOU KNOW HUMAN ERROR. WHICH IS A MUCH STIPULATE THAT THERE ARE WE KNOW THERE ARE TEN WAYS IN. TO THE STATE. RIGHT. DON'T OF THE DEFENDERS JOB IS TO. DISCOVER AND PATCH ALL TEN OF THOSE ROUTES IN. THE I PERSONALLY ONLY TO FIND ONE OF THEM WHAT THE ODDS OF THE DEFENDER FINDING THE EXACT SAME. WAY IN. THAT THE DEFENDER DISCOVERS FIRST IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE QUITE QUITE SMALL WHO DOES IT ASYMMETRY. YOU KNOW. THREAT HERE I'M THE AND THAT THAT'S WHY THIS IS A HARD CHALLENGE BOTH BOTH FOR A LECTURE PROFESSIONALS BUT INSIDE I FEEL GENERALLY. ARMED. THE ON ON YOUR ON YOUR YOUR YOUR BROADER QUESTION ABOUT. BECAUSE WHAT HE SAID. TRY TO KEEP LAW TO KEEP LAWS AND POLICIES UP WITH WITH. TECHNOLOGY AND AND AND YOU'VE ALL THE LANDSCAPE. YOU I MEAN YOU KNOW WASHINGTON MOVES SLOWLY A HUMANS. MOVE SLOWLY RIGHT I MEAN THE THESE ARE REALLY COMPLEX CHALLENGES ARE ROOTED IN SOME PRETTY COMPLICATED TECHNOLOGIES. WITH. NUMEROUS EQUITIES AT STAKE OFTEN EQUITIES THAT OUR INTENTION WITH EACH OTHER SO. YOU KNOW I'M IN YOU KNOW IN MY FORMER JOB RIGHT AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO BALANCE. SENATE ECONOMIC EQUITIES AROUND IN YOUR ENSURING THAT UNITED STATES THAT PRESERVES ITS LEADERSHIP ROLE IN INNOVATION. UP WITH. THREATS THAT MIGHT REQUIRE REGULATION AND THERE'S A TRADE OFF THEIR AND THAT'S JUST REALLY HARD HARD. THAT QUESTION TO GET AT ARM YOU KNOW ANOTHER ANOTHER. AREA RIGHT REALLY SAW THIS PLAY OUT WAS IN FEDERAL IT WHICH IS PART MY RESPONSIBILITY. AT THE WHITE HOUSE. SUBSTANTIVE FEDERAL IT. AND YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT YOU KNOW. WE IS A AS A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE OF THE NUMBER STE JUST BEGIN TO CHANGE OVER THE YEARS BUT YOU KNOW WE WE SPENT SOMETHING LIKE. EIGHTY PERCENT OF OUR IT BUDGET ON OPERATIONS AND MAKE. SUPPOSED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WHICH IS SWITCHES OFF BY ABOUT YOU TEN PERCENT APPEARED THE PRIVACY. AND I I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD BET THAT ARE ARE ARE BACK COLLEAGUES. AT THE STATE COUNTY WILL HAVE SIMILAR CHALLENGE WHERE. THE MONEY COMES IN FOR IT YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE THEY WORK WHERE THE MONEY FOR. YOU KNOW CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS COMES IN THESE KIND OF SPURTS AND MEANWHILE. THERE I'M SPEND MORE AND MORE MONEY I JUST MEAN TEEN THE EVEN SYSTEMS. THEY HAVE ARM YOU KNOW WE'D THAT THERE'S A PRETTY INNOVATIVE IDEAS OUT THERE FOR HOW TO CRACK THIS NOT. YOU KNOW WE AGAIN YOU AT THE END OF THE ABOUT ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED ON THE NINETEEN MODERNIZATION FIND. CONGRESSMAN HEARD A REPUBLICAN TEXAS PICK THIS IDEA UP THE LAST CONGRESS AND UP. IN IN IN THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT THE IDEA THERE IS THAT. AGENCIES CAN ESSENTIALLY. THEY THEY SUBMIT APPLICATIONS FOR PROJECTS TO MODERNIZE RIGHTY AND ENABLE THEM BORROW MONEY ON THIS FUND THAT HAVE TO REPAY BACK OVER TIME. USING THE SAVINGS THAT THEY ACQUIRE FROM FROM HAVING UPDATED THEIR SYSTEMS NOT HAVING TO DEAL WITH THAT THE LEGACY. YEAH. THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL I GOT GESTURE PREP. THROW A FEW MORE QUESTIONS THAT YOU GUYS BEFORE WE WRAP UP HERE. NEW THREATS THAT WE DIDN'T SEE LAST CYCLE. IF YOU'RE IN YOUR CRYSTAL BALL TRYING TO THINK THROUGH THE MIND OF THE. ATTACKER VERSUS THE DEFENDER AND PICKING ONE OF THOSE TEN EXITS MEAN WHAT. WHAT NEW STUFF FOR THEY GOING TO BE THROWING AT US THAT WE HAVE AND THAT WE DIDN'T SEE LAST TIME? SO YEAH IT'S ALWAYS YOU KNOW IT WAS DANGEROUS TO PUT THE FUTURE BUT NOW THAT I'M AN ACADEMIC NOT SPEAKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT I FEEL LIBERATED SO I WILL I WILL TELL. YES AYE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW ONE REALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE. THIS UPCOMING ELECTION TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ELECTIONS AT THE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN ELECTION WAS FUNDAMENTALLY A NATIONAL ELECTION RIGHT. IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT. WITH THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WROTE IN THE RUN CLASSIFIED. REPORT FROM JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND SO TEEN. THE RUSSIANS FOCUS WAS ON NATIONAL PUBLIC. AND THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT'S IT'S A MORE DIFFUSE. AND MORE REGIONAL. MORE REGIONAL ELECTION AND. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT CONCERNS ME IS THAT YOU KNOW WITH THE HOUSE A POTENTIALLY IN PLAY ACCORDING TO US TO SOME POLITICAL ANALYSTS. AND WITH YOU KNOW HUGE STAKES AHEAD FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS IN STATE. RACES. THAT YOU KNOW. I WAS FIGHTING. YOU KNOW USEFUL PARA PERMIT EVIL GENIUS HAD ON. YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW. REDIRECTING ENERGY AT STATE AND LOCAL RACES ARE BOTH OF THE. CONGRESSIONAL LEVEL BUT ALSO AT THE STATE HOUSE AND STATE POLITICAL LEVEL. YOU KNOW IF THE IF THE GOAL IS TO SOW CHAOS RIGHT. THAT'S A PRETTY ATTRACTIVE TARGET FOR FOR FOREIGN ADVERSARY AND SO DO YOU THINK THOSE CLOSER TO SMALLER LESS SOPHISTICATED JURISDICTION'S OUR OUR REPORT POTENTIALLY THAT THAT MORE IDEAL TYPE IF YOU'RE ABLE TO HIT. SO THERE'S. A TO GO KEEP GOING BACK YOUR STADIUM BUT THERE'S ONE BIG EXIT RIGHT CALL THAT THE ORANGE COUNTY YOU'RE THE LA COUNTY YOUR YOU KNOW. SOMEWHERE ON YOU KNOW. ON THE EAST COAST SOME. WHEN THESE HUGE VOTING PRECINCTS VERSES. A LOT OF LITTLE SMALL PENETRATIONS THAT SORT OF COLLECTIVELY SO THAT THIS COURT I MEAN. DOES THAT MEAN. THAT YES SO STERN YOU YET SO YOU KNOW I I MEAN I YOU KNOW. I THINK IT'S IT'S SOME UNREALISTIC AND UNFAIR TO EXPECT A LOCAL ARE COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIAL TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST. THE RUSSIAN RUSSIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE THAT IS NOT A FAIR. I MEAN IF IF RUSSIAN MILITARY DILIGENCE WANTS TO METAL. THE ODDS ARE ON THEIR SIDE THAT THEY WILL SUCCEED SOMEWHERE ANOTHER. THIS IS MY EMPHASIZED INCIDENT RESPONSE. OCCASIONS IN MY REMARKS. I AM WE HAVE TO REPAIR FOR THE POSSIBILITY. THAT. THERE'S INCIDENT. AND. YOU KNOW REAL OR FABRICATE. AND ENSURE THAT DEBT THAT THERE ARE ELECTION PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE THAT THE CANDIDATES THAT THE MEDIA ARE IN A POSITION TO. PORT. ACCURATE FACTS HAVE YOU SEEN THAT DONE WELL ANYWHERE YOU MANY EXAMPLES OF WHERE GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR HAD AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE THAT SORT OF WAS IT QUICK RESTORATION OF CONFIDENCE LEANING IN THE MUSE IT'S YEAH YOU KNOW I IT'S IT'S HARD FOR ME TO IDENTIFY EXAMPLES BECAUSE YES. THIS THIS THREAT SPACE IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW REPAIRED OTHER POLICY DOMAINS I THINK THAT DOM HYPOTHETICALLY THOUGH LIKE WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SO I I THOUGHT I I THINK YOU KNOW EXERCISE YOU CONDUCTING AN EXERCISE THAT INVOLVES. STATE LOCAL OFFICIALS THAT THE STATE AND YOU KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW DID ELECTION FOR STRUCTURE. GCC AND AND AND AND THAT'S YOU SEE. AND MAYBE EVEN FIGURED OUT HOW TO GET MEDIA INVOLVED COULD BE YOU KNOW USEFUL EXERCISE OF THE DAM TO TRICK THEIR. RIGHT IS TO ENSURE THE EXERCISE ACCOMPLISHES ITS GOAL WHICH IS TO. HOPE IDENTIFY ISSUES FIX THEN BUILD CONFIDENCE ENOUGH MEMORY NOT ACTUALLY. BECOME IT'S OWN SORT OF FEEL PUBLIC AFFAIRS FIASCO RIGHT BECAUSE AGAIN DUE TO THE GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS. IT'S HARD TO DO IF IF IF STAKEHOLDERS I FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T BE FORTHCOMING AND ABOUT PROBLEMS THAT FEAR OF YOU KNOW GETTING HUNG OUT TO DRY BY THE PRESS OR BY UP IN A POLITICAL. RIGHT. UNIT PIGGYBACK ON WHAT IS A GOOD JOB AND I BECAUSE I DID HAVE A SORT OF MORE CITIES AND FOCUSED QUESTION YOU TO IN TERMS A UTILIZING THE POWER OR YOUR NETWORKS AND OTHER NETWORKS OUT THERE THIS IS A LITTLE BIT RELATED TO JUST SAY. YOU KNOW WHILE WE'VE BEEN LEARNING. SO HAVE THE ADVERSARIES. I THINK WE CAN ASSUME THE ATTACKERS ALREADY IN THE STADIUM. A I THINK THAT THERE ARE NO TWELVE NOT TEN ROUTES OF INGRESS. YOU HAVE TO BE THINKING IN THOSE TERMS AND THAT'S WHY I EMPHASIZE RECOVERABILITY. THE ABILITY TO RECOVER REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS IS REALLY CRUCIAL ANYMORE DETAIL THOUGH WHAT WILLOW YOU MEAN BY RECOVERY WHAT IS RECOVERY LOOK LIKE YOU SO. YOU KNOW SOME OF THE COUNTIES. A LOT OF THE COUNTIES ACTUALLY BUT I IKNOW IN PARTICULAR OF ONE OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY RIGHT HERE TO LEVINE PUT TOGETHER REALLY OUTSTANDING DISASTER RECOVERY KIND OF PLAN. IT WAS VERY COMPREHENSIVE. AND IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU KNOW HELPS IF THERE'S A FLOOD ON ELECTION DAY AND YOU HAVE TO GET PEOPLE FROM THE SIDE OF THE RIVER NOT OUTSIDE OF THE RIVER TO COMMENT BEEN EELIN SO THAT PEOPLE CAN STILL VOTE IT'S ALL ABOUT PEOPLE CAN STILL VOTE. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT IF YOU HAVE AN AUDITABLE SYSTEM. AND YOU CAN CONDUCT A ROBUST AUDIT YOU WILL KNOW WHETHER EVEN IF SOMEBODY WAS IN. TAMPERING WITH THE SOFTWARE THAT THE OUTCOME WAS IN FACT CORRECT YOU CAN IDENTIFY THAT THERE WAS AN ANOMALY OR PROBLEMI COULD STILL GET A CORRECT DEL COM IF YOU HAVE A FULLY AUDITABLE SYSTEM. COURSE THEIR OTHER FACTORS YOU KNOW THERE'S CHAIN OF CUSTODY HAS TO BE REALLY ROBUST AND OTHER KINDS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY MEASURES. BUT LIKE I A I EMPHASIZE THE RECOVERABILITY JUST KIND OF KEEP US THINKING A STEP AHEAD OF WHERE OUR ADVERSARIES ARE BECAUSE OUR ADVERSARIES NO MAYBE. YOU KNOW GET INTO A SYSTEM THAT THEY FOUND A BACK DOOR INTO AND JUST BEEN WAITING. FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT WHICH MIGHT NOT OF BEEN YOU KNOW TWENTY SIXTEEN SURE WE HAVE SEEN ED PATTERN OVER TIME YOU YOU KNOW YOU YOU THAT'S IT LINE WEIGHT. YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT WHEN I MET WITH A. AND HIS BOSS ONE TIME HE SAID TO ME. YOU KNOW THERE'S BASICALLY TWO KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS THE ONES THAT AVE BEEN HACKED AND THE ONES THAT DON'T KNOW IT YET. AND IF SO AND I THINK THAT'S THAT ASSUMING THAT KIND OF ASSUME BREACH IS A GOOD WAY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE AND IT PROTECTION IS. IS A MISGUIDED EXPECTATION I'D STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT AND I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE PUBLIC WILL UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THEY DON'T EXPECT. A. PERFECTION. OR DON'T NEED TO EXPECT PERFECTION MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE EDUCATED BUT THEY DON'T EXPECT PERFECTION BUT THEY DO EXPECT DILIGENCE THAT YOU'RE MAKING THE EFFORT AND THAT YOU CAN SHOW YOUR WORK. YOU KNOW IT I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY THE KEY THEY WERE. IT THE MORE THEY KNOW. BECAUSE THE BETTER OFF THEY ARE. IN A DECISIVE FACTOR THINK HERE IS WHAT. QUALITY OF POLITICAL DISCOURSE AROUND A GIVEN. LIKE AND THAT'S WHY COME BACK TO THE DID THE VITAL IMPORTANCE LEADERSHIP LEADER FROM THE CANDIDATES AND AND I WOULD SAY I MEAN. THE LOSERS MATTER MORE THAN THE WINNERS. THAT I MEAN I I'M I I THINK IT THE WHO BOTH PARTIES AT LEAST IN THIS STATE AND DOES NOT IN PARTY'S. TO REALLY EMPHASIZE. WHEN YOU LOSE A RACE BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A LOSER. COMMUNICATING DIRECTLY WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT ACCEPTING. TERMS OF THAT ELECTION AND ODDLY YOU KNOW FEDERAL YOU'VE SEEN WINNERS ACTUALLY. CALL OUT FRAUD BUT. WILL SET THAT ASIDE IT'S A BIZARRE. YEAH IF I HAD TO COME BUT I THINK. YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO SORT OF FIND THAT POLITICAL COURAGE INCREASE IN SPACE IT WILL TRY TO ADDED TODAY'S HEARING FINAL LITTLE BIPARTISAN PLEDGE. THAT WE CAN START TO ENGAGE IN AND. DO SOMETHING THAT CAN BE PUBLICLY VISIBLE TO SAY SURE OF YOU KNOW I'M I'M STICKING WITH THIS SYSTEM. EVEN IF IT DOESN'T ALWAYS SUPPORT ME I DID WANT TO ASK. THOUGH. MISS SMITH. MEAN WITH THE QUANTITY OR AG TO BOTH OF YOU WITH THE QUANTITY OF THREATS OUT THERE ALL ALL THE SCANNING CONSULAR GONE WE HEARD FROM. KELLY. FIVE THOUSAND SCAN SINCE HE WAS SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE RIGHT IT'S IT'S IT'S CONSTANT. IS THERE. IS IS THERE A POINT WHICH THERE'S JUST. TO WHOM TO MUCH OUT THERE FOR GOVERNMENT OR EVEN A PLATFORM LIKE FACEBOOK TO BE ABLE THAT TRACK IN TERMS OF MISINFORMATION LIKE I I'M TRYING TO THINK THROUGH THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO DISINFORMATION. RIGHT BEFORE ELECTION IS THEIR CITIZEN COMPONENT HERE TO IS THERE A WAY TO INSERT A MEANING FULLY EQUIPPED THE PUBLIC. WITH THE ABILITY TO REPORT. WHAT THEY SEE IS SORT OF REALLY ELECTION RELATED MISINFORMATION AS OPPOSED TO? SPINNER POSTURE WHERE WE ALL ANGLE ON ISSUES AND TALKING ABOUT POLICY REALLY ON. POLLING PLACE INFORMATION AND THAT SORT OF. HAVE YOU SEEN THAT WORK. BEFORE WHERE. CITIZENS ARE FINDING THINGS BEFORE GOVERNMENT OR THE PRIVATE OR THE PLATFORMS CAN AND IS THERE SOME BETTER ROLE FOR THAT. EITHER IN FROM A MECHANICAL PERSPECTIVE FOR SPYING THREATS OR FROM A PERCEPTION PERSPECTIVE TO SAY. YOU YOU EVER YOU HAVE A ROLE IN THIS PROCESS TO TO BLOCK FOREIGN ACTORS FROM IT. ARE ALEXIAN SO I DON'T KNOW A. B. BOTH YOU COULD WEIGH IN ON IT IS A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN ANSWER AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN SORT OF. CITIZENS TAKE THE INITIATIVE TO REPORT HEY THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE GOING ON IT. YOU KNOW WHEN I TRIED TO VOTE THIS HAPPEN AND I DON'T KNOW WHY. AND IT GIVES THE ELECTION PROTECTION TYPE GROUPS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHECK IN WITH THE ELECTION OFFICIAL AND MAYBE THERE THAT THAT'S THE FIRST ALERT THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG MAYBE THAT CITIZEN DOESN'T KNOW. ABOUT TO CALL THE ELECTION OFFICIAL OR TWO REPORTED TO THEM DIRECTLY BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE HEARD ABOUT A HOTLINE AND IF THAT IF IF EVERYONE'S WORKING TOGETHER AND DOING THEIR JOB CORRECTLY. IT'S A CHANCE TO CONTACT THE ELECTION OFFICIALS SAY HEY THIS HAPPENED AND LET THEM INVESTIGATE AND TAKE ACTION. AND IT MIGHT BE THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE FOR THEM SO IT'S A VALUABLE THING TO HAVE. BICU ELECTION OFFICIALS ALL HAVE LINES COMING IN THAT THEY CAN TAKE THESE KINDS OF REPORTS BUT IF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT IT'S YOUR COUNTY THAT RUNS YOUR ELECTION YOU JUST GO AND VOTE WHERE THEY TELL YOU TO. YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT THAT'S THE PLACE TO DO IT. ACADEMICS OFTEN DO RESEARCH. JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE GEEKY AND INTERESTED IN THIS KIND OF STUFF AND THEY CAN FIND OF WAYS. TWO THEY COULD FIND PROBLEMS AND THEN FIND WAYS TO HELP RESOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS AND HAVE VERY GOOD ADVICE SO THAT'S WHY I RECOMMENDED THE. ELECTION SECURITY ADVISORY COUNCIL THAT WILL INCLUDE A. THAT TYPE OF EFFORT AND MAYBE ADDED A. SERVER BECAUSE IN EUROPE COROLLARY TO THAT CONCEPT. AND WHAT IS THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH LOOK LIKE FOR OUR DEMOCRACY RIGHT WHAT IT HAD. READ THAT ACTUAL COMMUNITY LEVEL HOW DO WE EMPOWER THOSE FOLKS SO. YEAH ADVISORY COUNCIL BUT THEN HOW. ARE WE INSTILL THAT PRIDE IN. CONSERVATIVE COMMUNITIES IN LIBERAL COMMUNITIES SO TO SAY LIKE THIS IS THIS IS YOUR YOUR RACE SO I KNOW WHAT ELSE IS YEAH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT I WOULD JUST ADD ONE OTHER THING TO. IT BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ELECTION CYCLE BEGAN SORT OF THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. THAT PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS ARE CENTER ON THE STATE'S AB SPONSORED SOME. CONVENING STE FOR MEDIA THEY DID FOR FIVE OF THEM AROUND THE COUNTRY I PARTICIPATED IN ONE. OF I WAS ON A PANEL WITH THE PERSON WHO WAS REPRESENTING THE. VOTING SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY. LOBBYING GROUP. IF SO. IT WAS GREAT IT WAS YOU KNOW SORT OF DIFFERING OPINIONS AND PERSPECTIVES ON THINGS. BUT IT WAS SUCH A VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WE COULD. PRE ANTICIPATE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO COME UP FOR THE USED A REPORTERS AND JOURNALISTS AND HELP FRAME FOR THEM WHAT THEY NEEDED TO KNOWN WHAT THEY NEED TO ASK. SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE THE NBC PROBLEM THAT WAS REFERRED TO EARLIER. SO THAT PEOPLE ARE USING THE RIGHT TERMINOLOGY EVEN. YOU KNOW SAYING ELECTION SYSTEM NOT VOTING SYSTEM IF THAT'S WHAT THEY MEAN ARE SAYING REGISTRATION SYSTEM NOW VOTING SYSTEM IF THAT'S WHAT THEY MEAN. AND BEING. A SORT OF A THIRD PARTY RESOURCE FOR. WHEN THE MEDIA WOULD CALL OVER THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE OF YOU KNOW HAD TO DO A LOT OF THAT THEY'D SAY WELL JUST HAVE I JUST NEED FIVE MINUTES I HAVE THESE QUESTIONS AND WE DAY. STAY WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION AND THEN I'D REALIZE WE HAVE TO START AT THE BEGINNING A THIRTY MINUTES LATER WE GET TO THE QUESTION. ONCE THEY UNDERSTOOD HOW IT WORKED I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THE MEDIA NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS IN THERE'S NEW JOURNALISTS ALL THE TIME TO REPORTERS ON THE BEAT ALL THE TIME THAT ARE DOING SOMETHING. NEW FOR THEM SO THEY DON'T KNOW SO NEEDS TO BE EDUCATION OF THE PUBLIC AND EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE INTERMEDIARY TO. VERY VERY USEFUL FEEDBACK. JUST TO. BRIEFLY. BEYOND PERCEPTION ACTUAL. CONCRETE SECURITY VALUED FOR A SORT OF MORE DISTRIBUTED SENTINEL SYSTEM IS THAT IS THAT A REAL KIND OF CONCEPT OR IS IT YEAH I THINK IT IS. I MEAN I THINK THAT YOU KNOW. ANYTIME THERE'S A SINGLE POINT FAILURE YOU'RE HERE LESS SECURE I I THINK. THAT IF YOU'RE MORE DISTRIBUTED. YOU KNOW BUT THE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE MORE. DISTRIBUTED NOTES THAT YOU HAVE THE LESS. ABLE THE. MINISTRY TO THOSE NOTES ARE. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE. FOR MANAGEMENT AND STAFF THEME IN PRODUCING IN THAT. LARGER ORGANIZATION CONTINUED MANAGEMENT AND THEN IS THIS IS A. IS A BALANCING IT'S HARD BOUNCE. WELL. I I FUNDS INCREDIBLY MULLIN FORESTS I APPRECIATE AND I I WOULD JUST ASK IF WE CAN CAN TEN YOU TO RELY ON YOUR COLLECTIVE EXPERTISE HERE S WE GO FORWARD. NOT JUST TODAY BUT YEAH THANK YOU AND. THANKS FOR BEING IN CALIFORNIA TO. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF OTHERS SOUGHT A SECOND WOOD WOOD MISTER CHAIR SAID. GONNA BE A LOT MORE WORK ON THIS IN THE COMING YEARS. AND WE WANT TO. YEAH. TO USE THAT WE CAN GET OUT FRONT. OF OUR ADVERSARIES. OR RELIGIOUS MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE. FIRMED UP OUR. THE. FOR LOOK LIKE OF A BETTER TERM BORDERS IF THERE ARE ANY IN THE IN THE STADIUM. AND SO YOU KNOW THIS CAN BE A LOT OF. LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY A LOT OF WORKING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I'VE GOT SOME IDEAS DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL CAMPAIGNS CAN WORK. WITH SOME OF THESE COMPANIES THAT OUR ADVERSARIES ARE USING TO PROMOTE MISINFORMATION AND CONFUSION AND DOUBT. IN IN THE PUBLIC'S MIND. SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD IDEAS I KNOW WE ALL HAVE A LINE NOTES. AND AND FOLLOW UP ITEM SO I'M SURE WE REACHING OUT ON SIR THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH LIKE IT'S NOT A BIG YEAR FOR HISTORY IN THE DAY THANK YOU. SOARING TO MOVE ON IT TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION OF TODAY'S HEARING. I HAVE FOR. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO HAVE SIGNED UP I ASK EACH OF YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO THREE MINUTES. AND IN THE FIRST IS GONNA BE. BRENT TURNER MISTER TURNER. AND UGH UGH GIVE EVERYONE. KINDA ONE MINUTE HEADS UP. WHEN YOU GO ONE THAT LETS. ASSUMES. HELLO COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRENT TURN AROUND WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VOTING OFFICIALS WE ARE THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP FOR SOFTWARE SECURITY. WE WERE THE FIRST TO DECLARE THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS IS BROKEN PER ROY SALTMAN THE INVENTOR OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY A CERTIFICATION PROCESS WE ARE THE PRO BONO BY PIONEERS OF THE CUTTING EDGE OPEN SOURCE VOTING SYSTEMS. THERE HAVE BEEN REFERENCED HERE WE FIRST DEMONSTRATED THOSE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR UNDER THE NAME OPEN VOTING CONSORTIUM ARE LANGUAGES NOW INCLUDED IN REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD RECENT FEDERAL. LEGISLATION DISCUSSING OPEN SOURCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH PAPER BALLOTS I'M HERE ARE SOME HARD TRUTHS. THE AIR GAPS THAT WERE DISCUSSED ARE GOOD BUT NOT ENOUGH. FOR CYBERSECURITY WE MUST PER PUSH FURTHER TO INOCULATE AGAINST THE INTERNET. SECURITY ISSUES AS THE. THE BAD FOLKS COME IN THROUGH THE VENDORS A THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE DE CENTRALIZATION IS GOOD BUT NOT ENOUGH MORE FACT HERE RISK LIMITING AUDITS AND PAPER BALLOTS ARE GOOD BUT NOT ENOUGH. AND ONLY ONE HALF OF THE CONVERSATION WHAT HIS BEEN OMITTED TODAY FOR THE MOST PART OR AT LEAST INSUFFICIENTLY REFERENCED IS INFORMATION REGARDING THE SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE IS CURRENTLY PRIVATIZED AND DO THAT PRIVATIZATION THE SYSTEMS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE PROPERLY SECURED AND NEVER WILL BE AS LONG AS ARE COMING FROM VENDORS AND OUR PRIVATE. THE NEXT TRUTH IS THAT THE SOLUTION SOFTWARE WHICH IS PUBLIC OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IS AVAILABLE BUT BEING SIDELINED BY CORPORATE VENDOR INTERESTS. THE LICENSING TO WHICH. DEAN LOGAN REFERENCED IS NOT TRIVIAL IT MUST BE P. L. GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE THREE POINT OH THAT WILL GUARANTEE. GUARANTEE SHARE ABILITY THE SOLUTION SYSTEMS ARE MORE SECURE LEFT TO SPEND EXPENSIVE CURRENTLY DEPLOYED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR THE MOST PART EXCEPT FOR THE TABULATION PIECE. AND NOW CURRENTLY SLATED FOR SAN FRANCISCO THEY WILL BE FIFTY PERCENT LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THE CURRENT SYSTEMS WE MUST WATCHDOG AGAINST THE STATUS QUO PRESERVATIONISTS. AND GRANT ABSORBING FIVE OH ONE. THREE'S THAT ARE CONTROLLING THIS CONVERSATION AND ALSO SEEPING INTO ACADEMIA THE OPEN SOURCE ARE YOU GONNA WHAT'S AT ONE MINUTE. THANK YOU THE OPEN SOURCE SCIENTISTS ARE CRUCIAL TO YOU FOR THE TRUTH HERE PLEASE DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE VENDOR INTEREST THAT CONFLICTS WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY. IT CREEPS INTO ALL ASPECTS AS HAS BEEN REFERENCED BY MY ASSOCIATE JAMES WOOLSEY FORMER CIA DIRECTOR. PEW VERIFIED VOTING AND OTHERS CONTINUE THE CIRCULAR CONVERSATION WHILE TAKING GRANT MONIES BUYING NEW PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS IT'S OF THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY HERE. ANY FURTHER MONEY MUST GO TOWARD SECURE BOWL OPEN SOURCE SYSTEMS. A FINALLY WE SUGGEST SWORN TESTIMONY THAT FUTURE HEARINGS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER TURNER. THEN NEXT WEEK I HAVE GYM SOBRE. HELLO MY NAME IS JIM SO PER IBM. CULTURE THE VOTING TRANSPORTS AND AUTHORED THE WEBSITE COUNTED AS CATS THAT ORG. UP. I SPOKE. HERE FOUR YEARS AGO. WHEN SENATOR PATEA HELD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ABOUT WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED SINCE FATHER. AND WE'VE REVIEWED MY NOTES THERE AND THEY STILL STAND PRETTY MUCH. I WILL TRY TO SEND YOU A POINTER TO THAT. WHAT'S MISSING HERE. IN MUCH THE CONVERSATION IS SOMETHING THAT I. POINTED OUT. FOUR YEARS AGO I SAID. THE MOST IMPORTANT THREAT. SOME INSIDERS. I STAND BY THAT TODAY. THAT IS. PRINCIPALLY THE PROGRAMMERS. GEOFFREY DEAN'S WITH TWENTY THREE CONVICTIONS FOR EMBEZZLEMENT. PROGRAMMING DEED PEOPLE MACHINES. OR CLING KURDISH BEING HIRED TO WRITE CREATE A MACHINE A VOTING MACHINE THAT WOULD MAKE VOTES. INSIDERS. THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST. VERY KIND A PROBLEM IS OPEN SOURCE. SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN LOOK AT IT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT IT IT'S NOT ABSOLUTE. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF LINES OF CODE TOTALLY INVOLVED BUT IT'S A DETERRENT. THAT THEY MIGHT BE. CAUGHT A TREND TO PUT IN SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE. A. IBM REALLY FRUSTRATED I'VE BEEN AT THIS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE. TO SEE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS YET TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPMENT. AND I'VE BEEN HERE ESPECIALLY THE LAST FEW YEARS SERVICES BECAUSE WORKING HARD ON THIS MISTER LOGAN'S. ARE WORKING HARD ON IT. THEY NEED SOME HELP SPECIALLY SAN FRANCISCO. ARE I'M GOING TO BE AT THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING TOMORROW NIGHT INSTEAD OF CISCO. THEY'VE GOT VERY GOOD PEOPLE THERE. AND THEY'RE WORKING HARD ON THIS. AND I'M GLAD THAT THE GOVERNOR PUT IN A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR EQUIPMENT. SPUN IT THAT THERE'S NO MONEY FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. IN SOFTWARE IN SYSTEMS THAT WOULD SAVE CALIFORNIA. THE COUNTIES AND EVEN THE STATE. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS DOLLARS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE TEN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. SO MY PRIMARY ARE. URGING HERE IS THAT YOU KEEP THAT IN THE BUDGET. THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SO THAT THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. ALSO WON'T FUNDING FOR CERTIFICATION OF ANY OTHER CERTIFICATION AND TESTING THE OTHER OPEN SOURCE IS. THERE SYSTEMS DEVELOPED THAT BEING DEVELOPED THE UNIVERSITY FLORIDA AND TRAVIS COUNTY APPARENTLY IS CUT BACK ON TRACK. FOR THEM TO BRING THEIR SYSTEMS THEN. IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO PAY FOR CERTIFICATION TESTING. CALIFORNIA SHOULD HELP COVER THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MRS SOBRE. NEXT I HAVE RICHARD TAM. A GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME MY NAME IS RICHARD TAM I AM ANOTHER CO CHAIR OF THE VOTING RIGHTS TASK FORCE I WANNA. SUPPORT WHAT JIM SAID A IN THAT BUDGET ITEM ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION. IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO ALLOW THE COUNTY STILL LEASE SYSTEMS RATHER THAN BY THEM. FOR THE ONE REASON THAT. WHEN LA DEVELOPS ITS SYSTEM WHEN SENATORS CO DEVELOPED THAT SYSTEM. THEY WILL PICK UP MADE AVAILABLE AT A GREATLY REDUCED PRICE TO THE OTHER COUNTIES THEN THE PRIVATE. A. PROPRIETARY CODE BICU HIDDEN CODE THE OF. NO PRIVATE VENDORS SO. THAT'S HOW THE STATE WOULD SAVE MONEY IT COULD INVEST SOME MONEY IN. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAN FRANCISCO AND LA SYSTEMS AND THEN REAP A HUGE HARVEST OF SAVINGS. BY THOSE SYSTEMS BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO THE OTHER COUNTIES. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS TO RISK LIMITING AUDITS. OF WHICH HAWKING ABOUT THE A PROBLEM WITH THE ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY BEING MADE EVEN WEAKER. ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY WAS NEVER AN AUDIT. IT WAS SIMPLY TO CHECK ON SOMETHING SEATS IF YOU CONSIDERED AN AUDIT IT WOULD BE AN EXTREMELY WEAK ONE. SOME COUNTIES A DOZEN COUNTIES HAVE ALREADY DONE. A PILOT RISK LIMITING AUDITS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WITH DOCTOR PHILIP STARK. OF WHY DON'T WE ALLOW THESE ANY COUNTY WHO WANTS. TO CHECK OUT. INSTEAD OF DOING A ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY TO A RISK LIMITING ORDER. THEY COULD EASILY TO THAT FOR ALL THE. GOOD CONTESTS WITHIN COUNTY. ALL THE OLD OLD. OLD OVER RACES WITHIN THE COUNTY THEY COULD EASILY SWITCH FROM DURING THE ONE PERCENT MANUAL TALLY TO RISK LIMITING ORDER. IN THIS NEXT ELECTION WHY WAIT. UNTIL A BILL GOES THROUGH THAT THE CA CEO ENDING LOGANO WORKING ON BECAUSE. THAT WILL. THAT WON'T IT'S A AT THAT ONE GOING TO AFFECT UNTIL NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER OR. FOUR YEARS FROM NOW. YOU KNOW SO. UP V. IT COUNTIES CAN EASILY TO RISK LIVING ARTISTS WITHIN COUNTY THERE ARE TWO OTHER KINDS OF RACES. MOST OF YOU PROBABLY ARE ELECTED FROM MULTI COUNTIES MANY MANY A ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS ARE OF THEIR DISTRICTS ARE INTO A THREE DIFFERENT COUNTIES. THAT GETS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED STATE RACES EVEN ARE EASIER THAN MULTI COUNTY ONES FOR RISK LIMITING ORDERS BUT. IT YOU COULD EASILY TO AN URGENCY BILL. TO ALLOW ANY REGISTRARS TO IMMEDIATELY DIVERS CLUMPING ARTISTS WITHIN THEIR COUNTY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER DAM AND NEXT I'VE NICHOLAS HEIGHT ON. HI JEREMY NICHOLS SIDE ON WITH CALIFORNIA COME BECAUSE JUST ONE SAY. STARBUCKS SAYING THANK YOU TO YOU INTO CHAIR STERN IN ABSENTIA OF FOR PUTTING ON THIS WONDERFUL HEARING REALLY PUTTING A SPOTLIGHT ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I THINK ROLL TESTIMONY WE'VE HEARD TODAY TWO MAIN THEMES KIND OF EMERGED TO ME THAT I'VE TAKE COMMON CAUSE STRONGLY AGREES WITH. THE FIRST IS THAT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF ANY INTRUSION INTO OUR ELECTION SYSTEMS AND TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIANS CAN TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. THAT'S REALLY THE MAIN TAKEAWAY AND ONE THAT'S VERY REPORT. THAT SAID THE SECOND TAKE AWAY AS WE ARE CALIFORNIAN WE KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER. AND WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER BECAUSE THOSE WHO DO WANT TO INTERFERE WITH OUR ELECTIONS THEY'RE GONNA KEEP STRIVING HARDER AND HARDER SAYS IS NOT SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN REST ON OUR LAURELS. INSTINCTS STATIC WE NEED TO KEEP IMPROVING. TWO THINGS THAT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO THIS YEAR THAT WOULD REALLY HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT. IS THE FUNDING ISSUE WHICH BEEN TALKED ABOUT OR ELECTION SYSTEMS ARE OR FOR OR EQUIPMENT IS FAR TOO OLD WE DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE SITUATION OF FLORIDA CIRCUIT TWO THOUSAND. THE SAME ISSUES WE CAN REALLY EXAMINE PROCESS HE'S AND PARTICULARLY THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE HUGE STRIDES IS HERE HIM PUSHING US CLOSER TO HAVING. FULL RISK LIMITING AUDITS FOR THIS TO CALIFORNIA THIS IS REALLY DIRECTION WE NEED TO GO TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR SYSTEMS WITH A STRONG PAPER BASED ON TING BACK UP. OVER THIS THANK YOU AGAIN AS CHAIR AND A LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE ADVOCATES IN THE CLERK SAID REGISTRARS IN THIS YEAR TO COME THANK YOU. THANK YOU NICHOLAS. SO THAT IS OUR LAST MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO SIGNED UP TO SPEAK OUT IS WHEN I THINK EVERYBODY OF THE PANELISTS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY I DIFFERENT ONE RECOGNIZE OF THE STAFF OF THE. ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE I KNOW Y'ALL CALL IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. ELECTIONS AND SOMETHING ELSE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS COMMITTEE UP FOR PUTTING ON TODAY'S PANEL IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ADDING NICHOLAS REALLY WRAPPED UP WELL. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS. THAT OUR ELECTION SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA ARE SECURE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN HACKED. BUT THEY'RE UNDER CONSTANT THREAT. AND SO WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN I TO IMPROVE OUR SYSTEMS AND CONSTANTLY STAY VIGILANT EYE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY. FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY'S HEARING
