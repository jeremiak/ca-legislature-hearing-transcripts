DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS WHETHER MORE

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:48.032
INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD

00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:49.366
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TINY HOMES

GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE TODAY- WE

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:55.739
GOT SERVICE PROVIDERS WE'VE GOT

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:57.308
A GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND IN

00:42:57.374 --> 00:42:58.275

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:08.452
LOOKING AT FINGERPOINTING WE'RE

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:10.654
LOOKING AT A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:12.623
IT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THAT

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:13.624
THE CURRENT SOLUTION TO NOT

00:43:13.691 --> 00:43:14.925
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND WE'VE

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:16.260
GOT TO BE INNOVATIVE AND WHERE

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:18.128
THE STATE HAS NOT STEPPED UP TO

00:43:18.195 --> 00:43:20.097

THERE ARE OTHER AREAS THAT HAVE

00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:25.769
ALSO NOT STEPPED UP WE SHOULD

00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:27.037
SAY THAT TOO BECAUSE THE

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:28.872
HOMELESS POPULATION HAS GROWN

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:32.676

00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:36.080
SHELTER AND ROOF OVER THE HEAD.

00:43:36.146 --> 00:43:36.880
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE FOCUS IS

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:38.816
TODAY SO WE WE'RE NOT GONNA

00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:39.416

TODAY ON TO SHELTER OVER

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:53.330

YOU IMAGINE IF THIS WAS YOUR

00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:28.265
LIFE. DAY IN DAY OUT. THIS IS AN

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:29.566
ABOUT THREE FOUR HOURS THE

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:31.702
CONVENIENCE OUTSIDE. IF YOU WALK

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:33.570

00:44:33.637 --> 00:44:34.705
ANGELES CITY ALL OVER L. A.

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:37.841
COUNTY. IS TEN CITIES EVERYWHERE

00:44:37.908 --> 00:44:40.811
WE CAN'T SUGAR COAT THAT. CAN'T

00:44:40.878 --> 00:44:42.046
TEN CITIES EVERYWHERE PEOPLE

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:45.049
LIVING IN A N. N. INTENSE PEOPLE

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:46.316
LIVING ON THE CARDBOARD BOXES

00:44:46.383 --> 00:44:48.385
PEOPLE LIVING UNDER WOULD SHIFT-

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:50.287
MAKE HOME HOUSES- PEOPLE LIVING

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:53.490
UNDER OFFRAMP ALL ACROSS THE

00:44:53.557 --> 00:44:54.091

00:44:57.428 --> 00:44:58.929
THAT ALL RIGHT IT CAN GO ON ON

00:44:58.996 --> 00:45:00.464
THE LIST OF THINGS. SO THIS IS

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:02.232
JUST A MINOR INCONVENIENCE OF A

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:03.967
COUPLE OF HOURS. BUT IF THIS WAS

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:07.204
YOUR REALITY. FOR YEARS. COULD

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:10.040
YOU IMAGINE IF THERE WAS A SENSE

00:45:10.107 --> 00:45:10.641
OF URGENCY TO GETTING THE WORK

00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:13.043
DONE. SO I HOPE THIS INSTILLS A

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:14.378
SENSE OF URGENCY WILL TALK ABOUT

00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:16.280
SIMPLE TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

00:45:16.346 --> 00:45:17.047
THERE'S A POLL THAT REVEALED.

00:45:17.114 --> 00:45:18.682
THAT 95% OF THE VOTERS THOUGHT

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:19.516
HOMELESSNESS WAS THE BIGGEST

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:21.452
PROBLEM AND THAT THEY WERE ANGRY

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:24.088
FRUSTRATED OVERWHELMED. TODAY WE

00:45:24.154 --> 00:45:25.155
INVITE SOMEBODY TO WALK THROUGH

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:26.123
A POLL THAT JUST SHOWS THAT THE

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:27.491
PART OF THAT THE FRUSTRATION OF

00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:29.560
THE PROBLEMS GOT WORSE- IN OUR

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:32.096
RESIDENTS SIZE. AND IT NOW IT

00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:34.331
REELS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:35.199
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:45:35.265 --> 00:45:37.167
WHAT THE YOUR STATE OR LOCAL A

00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:38.635
REPRESENTATIVE THEY DON'T SEE A

00:45:38.702 --> 00:45:39.736
DIFFERENCE ANYMORE OR WHERE OR

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:41.205
WHAT YOU REPRESENT WE'RE ALL

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:42.339
PART OF THE PROBLEM AND WE'LL

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:44.108
FIX IT I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE THE

00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:46.443
SENATE. FOUND A BOTTOM OUT HOW

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:47.744

00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:49.980
WE'RE DONE WITH EXCUSES IT ALSO

00:45:50.047 --> 00:45:51.315
REVEALS THAT PEOPLE WANT FASTER

WE WERE HERE LAST TIME I DON'T

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:55.452
THINK THAT WAS THE CASE TODAY

00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:56.320
PEOPLE ARE SAYING EMERGENCY

00:45:56.386 --> 00:45:58.255

00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:58.168
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IT'S A MORAL

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:00.370
CRISIS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. A

00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:02.773
COMMUNITY SAFETY CRISIS AND IT'S

00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:03.974
ALSO CRISIS THAT I BELIEVE

00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:05.542
THREATENS THE VERY DESIRABILITY

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:08.612
OF LOS ANGELES AS A PLACE TO

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:10.447
LIVE TO VISIT TO DO BUSINESS. WE

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:11.948
HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF

00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:12.783
UNSHELTERED PEOPLE LIVING ON OUR

00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:16.219
STREETS. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:18.922
BETWEEN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AND

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:21.892
JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:22.726
FIFTEEN HUNDRED ON HEALTH ELLIE

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:25.429
RESIDENTS DIED ON OUR STREETS.

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:27.497
THAT'S BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR

00:49:27.564 --> 00:49:30.033
PEOPLE A DAY. IT'S UTTERLY

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:34.504
UNCONSCIONABLE AND IT'S TRAGIC

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:36.206
AND IT'S LARGELY PREVENTABLE. I

00:49:36.273 --> 00:49:37.207
IN MY OFFICE HAVE DEDICATED

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:38.675
SIGNIFICANT TIME TO ANALYZING

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:40.043
VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE CITY

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.211
BAILEY'S RESPONSE TO

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:42.779
HOMELESSNESS. AND WHAT I WANT TO

00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:44.781
ADDRESS NOTABLY IS THE ONGOING

00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:46.183
AUDITS AND REVIEWS THAT WE'VE

00:49:46.249 --> 00:49:48.719
DONE OF TRIPLE H. ON THERE OF

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.087
COURSE MANY REASONS THAT PEOPLE

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:52.155
ARE HOMELESS BUT HOUSING IS KEY.

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:53.123
AND A FOCUS OF THE CITY'S

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:54.157
EFFORTS TO ALLEVIATE

00:49:54.224 --> 00:49:55.726
HOMELESSNESS OVER THE LAST FIVE

00:49:55.792 --> 00:49:58.428
YEARS HAS BEEN TRIPLE H. THIS IS

00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:00.764
THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:03.166

HOMELESSNESS. AS OF TODAY WE

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:16.913
HAVE JUST OVER ONE THOUSAND OF

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.049
THESE UNITS COMPLETED- I FIRST

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:20.517
LOOK AT TRIPLE H. PROJECT IN

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:22.586
OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:24.421
RECOMMENDING REALLOCATING FUNDS.

00:50:24.488 --> 00:50:25.389
TO WHAT I BELIEVE WE'RE LOWER

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:27.324
COST PROJECTS TO STREAMLINING

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:30.060
PERMITTING AND ALSO OTHER THINGS

00:50:30.127 --> 00:50:32.028
THAT CAN BE DONE TO GET MORE

00:50:32.095 --> 00:50:33.263
PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS MORE

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.999
QUICKLY. BECAUSE IT'S TAKING WAY

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:37.601
TOO LONG AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:39.703
DETAILS OF WHAT THAT IS ABOUT.

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:42.072
NOW LAST MONTH THE CITY ISSUED

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:42.939
TWO HUNDRED AND TWO WELL OF

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:44.775
MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW TRIPLE H.

DEPT OF THE PREVIOUS ISSUANCE

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:48.378
WAS ALL THE WAY BACK IN TWO

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:51.214
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. WE HAD

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:54.217
ACTUALLY. ISSUED UP UNTIL JUST

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:56.219
LAST MONTH ONLY THREE HUNDRED

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:57.721

AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:05.262
TWELVE MILLION. BUT HE THE

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:06.763
ORIGINAL THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:08.365
TWO MILLION FORTY FOUR MILLION

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:10.000
REMAINS UNSPENT AND OF COURSE

00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:13.770
NONE OF THE- RECENT TWO HUNDRED

00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:15.405
AND TWELVE HAS BEEN SPENT YET.

00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:17.307
AS OF NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:19.042
ONE ONLY SEVENTEEN OF ONE

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:20.510
HUNDRED AND TEN PROJECTS HAVE

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:22.446
BEEN COMPLETED I REGRET TO SAY

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:23.713
DESPITE A LOT OF GREAT EFFORTS

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.081
FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE A LOT OF

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.082
WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:51:26.149 --> 00:51:27.884
INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. BUT

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:29.519
IT'S A PROCESS THAT IS BEEN

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:32.823
FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS- JUST OVER

00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:34.057
ONE THOUSAND BOND FUNDED UNITS

00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:36.092
ARE ACTUALLY IN SERVICE. OF

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:39.262
WORLD TOLD THAT THERE WILL BE

00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:39.896
SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SOME

00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:42.599
UNITS ARE TRANSLATING INTO ABOUT

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:43.800
EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED BEDS. NOW

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:44.835
THERE'S ALSO INNOVATION

00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:46.937
CHALLENGE PROJECTS THAT'S A

00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:47.671
HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:51:47.737 --> 00:51:50.140
SET ASIDE. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:51.508
FIFTEEN PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:53.243
THESE WERE THE ONES THAT WERE

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:54.978
SUPPOSED TO GET DONE QUICKLY.

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:57.514
BUT ACTUALLY NONE ARE COMPLETED

00:51:57.581 --> 00:52:00.517
AND TWO ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION-

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:02.085
OF THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:04.221
DOLLARS ALSO THIS FORTY SEVEN

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:06.022
MILLION THAT'S BEEN SPENT FOR

00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:08.158
FACILITY PROJECTS. AND WHAT

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:09.493
WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THE

00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:11.428
HOUSING IS TAKING FOUR TO SIX

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:12.863
YEARS TO BUID. NOW ALL THE

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:14.397
CITIES PAYING ABOUT AN AVERAGE

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:16.666
OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE

00:52:16.733 --> 00:52:17.334
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH TRIPLE

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.003
H. UNIT. UP AND WHILE THE UNITS

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.571
WERE SUPPOSED TO COST BETWEEN

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:23.406
THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:23.974
TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.410
THOUSAND. THE AVERAGE IS NOW AT

00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:27.911
FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:28.645
THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR THAT'S

00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:30.514
ROUGHLY THE SAME AS PURCHASING A

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.849
NEW SINGLE FAMILY. AT A RATHER A

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:35.652
NEW CONDO IN L. A. COUNTY. AND

00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:37.821
WHAT WE HAVE FOUND ALSO IS THAT

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:39.623
THERE ARE UNITS THAT ARE COSTING

00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:40.924
AS MUCH AS SEVEN HUNDRED

00:52:40.991 --> 00:52:42.492
THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND WE ARE

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:44.194
EXPECTING THAT THAT NUMBER IS

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:46.062
GOING TO BE SEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:47.163
FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS FOR SOME

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:49.332
UNITS. WHICH I HAVE TO SAY I

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:51.801
THINK IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS

00:52:51.868 --> 00:52:53.336
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS WHEN YOU

00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:54.671
LOOK AT IT AND COST PER BED IT'S

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:56.973
ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:57.741
THOUSAND JUST SHY OF FIVE

00:52:57.807 --> 00:52:59.042
HUNDRED DOLLARS FIVE HUNDRED

00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.876
THOUSAND PER BAD BUT THAT'S

00:52:59.943 --> 00:53:02.646
STILL VERY HIGH. SO WHAT'S THE

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:04.447
PROBLEM FIRST OF ALL TOO MUCH

00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:06.116
FUNDING COMPLEXITY ON AVERAGE WE

00:53:06.182 --> 00:53:08.818
FOUND. THAT OF FOR PROJECTS THAT

00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:10.654
WE'VE APPROVED FOR TRIPLE H.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.556
THERE ARE SEVEN FUNDING SOURCES

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:14.324
IMAGINE PIECING TOGETHER SEVEN

00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:15.759
DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES IT

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.260
TAKES YEARS IT TAKES A LOT OF

00:53:17.327 --> 00:53:19.195
CARRYING COSTS. A CHALLENGING

00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:22.032
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK- BECAUSE

00:53:22.098 --> 00:53:23.900
THERE ARE ALL OF THESE SUBSIDIES

00:53:23.967 --> 00:53:24.634
INVOLVED WE FOUND THAT MANY

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:26.736
PROJECTS HAD AN UNUSUALLY HIGH

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:28.305
PERCENTAGE OF SOFT COSTS

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:30.774
ANYWHERE BETWEEN. THIRTY FIVE

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.511
AND 40% SOFT COST IN SOME CASES.

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:36.446
OFTEN IT'S OF THE LAND USE

00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:38.415
CONSULTANTS THE LOBBYIST THE

00:53:38.481 --> 00:53:42.285
ATTORNEYS OF THE- OF COURSE COST

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:44.387
OF CARING FOR YEARS AND YEARS.

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:46.222
AND COST OF CONTINUE TO RISE WE

00:53:46.289 --> 00:53:46.990
KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:48.592
CONSTRUCTION OF MATERIALS HAVE

00:53:48.658 --> 00:53:50.393
INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY SO THE

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.695
LONGER IT TAKES THE MORE

00:53:51.761 --> 00:53:53.997
EXPENSIVE IT GOES. WE ALSO FOUND

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.065
THAT THERE WAS A LIMITED POOL OF

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:56.366
ELIGIBLE DEVELOPERS BECAUSE

00:53:56.433 --> 00:53:58.335
TRIPLE H. REGULATIONS. ARE

00:53:58.401 --> 00:54:00.103
REQUIRED TO LEAD DEVELOPERS TO

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.171
DEMONSTRATE A HISTORY OF

00:54:01.237 --> 00:54:02.439
BUILDING AND MANAGING SUPPORTIVE

00:54:02.505 --> 00:54:04.307
HOUSING PROJECTS BUT THERE WAS

00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:07.043
NOT A BIG POOL OF THOSE

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:08.311
AVAILABLE. AND OF COURSE LABOR

00:54:08.378 --> 00:54:10.614
COMES INTO IT AS WELL. I BELIEVE

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.682
THAT WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO GET

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:14.217
FASTER CHEAPER PROJECTS AND

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:16.386
PEOPLE OFF THE STREET MORE.

00:54:16.453 --> 00:54:18.421
QUICKLY YOU LOOK AT A PROJECT

00:54:18.488 --> 00:54:20.123
HOME TO YOU LOOK AT PROJECT ROOM

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.791
KEY LOOK AT SAFE SLEEPING

00:54:21.858 --> 00:54:24.327
VILLAGES SAFE PARKING. AND THESE

00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:26.029
ARE IN PERFECT BUT THERE ARE

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:29.132
WAYS TO SAVE LIVES TODAY. AND

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:30.967
ALSO WAYS TO REALLY MAKE THE

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:32.802
WHOLE PROCESS OF TAX CREDITS

00:54:32.869 --> 00:54:35.372

SO THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS AT

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:33.856
THIS POINT THEIR SHORT TERM

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.291
INVESTMENTS RIGHT THERE ONE TIME

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:36.292
WE DON'T HAVE THE SUSTAINABLE

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:37.894
FUNDING AND WITHOUT SUSTAINABLE

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.429
FUNDING IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:41.297
MAKE PERMANENT INVESTMENTS. IT'S

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:42.598
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR HOMELESS

01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:43.766
SERVICES PROVIDERS WHO DON'T

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:45.701
HAVE CONTINUITY OF FUNDING TO

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:47.336
REALLY BUILD STRONG PROGRAM TO

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:48.905
MAINTAIN THEM OVER TIME WITH ALL

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.907
OF THE SPENDING SWINGS. I'M AND

01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:51.941
THEN WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:54.143
HOUSING- WE HAVE A SHORTFALL OF

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.578
OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:56.846
AFFORDABLE UNITS IN L. A. COUNTY

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:58.581
AS A RESULT EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:01:58.648 --> 01:02:00.083
RENTAL SUBSIDIES TO HAVE A PAY

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:01.617
TO PAY TO HAVE A WAY TO PAY THE

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:02.652
RENT TO HELP ON THOSE FEDERAL

01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:04.554
SUBSIDIES. THEY CAN WAIT SIX

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.555
MONTHS TWELVE MONTHS OR EVEN

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:07.223
LONGER TO FIND A UNIT AND ALLOW

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:09.225
LOCAL RENT TO THEM. SO SOME

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:10.259
PEOPLE ACTUALLY WITH THOSE

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:11.260
FEDERAL SUBSIDIES THEY HAVE AT

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:12.428
THEIR EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:14.263
THEY HAVE A WAY TO PAY THE RENT.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.231
THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT ABLE TO

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:17.867
LEASE UP- THAT IS THAT IS LIKE

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.936

EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULT AND I

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:25.194
GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE THAT

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.729
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:28.297
THE SAME THING IS THAT THE WAY

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:30.132
THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING. IN A ROOM

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:31.601
IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING OR IS IT

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.135
THE CONSISTENT UNDERFUNDING

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.371
PIECEMEAL FUNDING AND LACK OF

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:37.640
REALISM ABOUT WHAT WE ACTUALLY

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:40.977
GOING TO. BUILD YEAH SURE AND I

DID NOT COORDINATE THIS TOGETHER

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:43.312
BUT I'M GOING TO HIT ON THOSE

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:44.814
THINGS. SO I WANT TO START WITH

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.749
A QUICK OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE HAVE

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:48.417

STATE INVESTMENTS IN THAT IN THE

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:52.755
CITY. AND THEN LOOK AT WHAT

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:54.090
STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE TO

01:04:54.156 --> 01:04:55.558
PROVIDE HOUSING FOR ALL INJURY

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:56.826

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:31.040
CRUCIAL BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT

WAS REALLY GREAT LAST YEAR ONE

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:35.431
OF THE THINGS IT DID WAS IT PUT

THERE WAS MONEY FROM THE STATE

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:41.904
AND THEN WE HAD OUR OWN

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:44.039

01:11:04.693 --> 01:11:06.595
FOURTEEN HUNDRED UNITS AS WAS

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:07.730

PAYMENT HOUSING TO GO WITH IT.

01:11:56.945 --> 01:11:58.814

01:11:58.881 --> 01:12:00.115
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE MILLION

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:10.759
INVESTMENT WORTH MAKING BUT AT

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:10.345
POINT WHEN WILL WE ALL IN THE

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:12.247
STATE WHATEVER YOU WANT FROM US

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:14.082
WE ALL NEED TO BE IN THE SAME

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:15.250
ROOM AT THE SAME TIME DO WE HAVE

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:17.319
THAT MECHANISM WILL WE HAVE THAT

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:18.787
MECHANISM IS THIS SOME HAS

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:20.823
ALREADY BEEN DONE. OR DOES NEED

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:22.858
TO BE A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE. IT'S

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:23.959
ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:25.727
IMPROVEMENT WITH THE ONE OF THE

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:27.462
WAYS WE SHORTEN THE PROCESSING.

KNOW AGAIN IF I HAD MY DRUTHERS

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:34.937

ONE APPLICATION FOR ALL ITS

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:37.706

COUNTY AS WE'RE DOING WITH HOME

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:44.813
KEY. SO THAT WE COULD JUST HAVE

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.114
ONE SOURCE OF FUNDING INSTEAD

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:48.116
OF. OUR DEVELOPERS HAVING TO

01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:49.685

NOT GIVING YOU A HARD TIME BUT-

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:58.026

01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:01.964
HOMELESS PERSON SITTING.

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:03.365
ENCAMPED FROM THEIR HOUSE.

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:05.734
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE SOMETHING.

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:09.972

ANALYSIS WOULD BE PROVIDED TO

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:34.096
US. BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY PAINFUL.

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:36.298
THAT'S A LONGER DISCUSSION AND

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.666
WE PROBABLY HAVE TRIED SAYING

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:39.601
THAT HE'S WRONG. I'M SAYING THAT

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:40.936
TALKING ABOUT THE COST OF

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:42.504
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND NOT

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:43.538
TALKING ABOUT THE OVERALL COST

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:47.042
OF HOUSING. AS THOUGH AFFORDABLE

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:49.411
HOUSING RIGHT OUTLIER IS- NOT

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:51.680

COMING ONLINE EVERY TEN DAYS

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:10.866
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS

01:16:10.933 --> 01:16:12.267

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:16.705

HARD NOT TO FOCUS ON- CONTROL

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:04.079
CONFERENCE- EARLIER COMMENTS I

THINK WHEN VOTERS. VOTED TO

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:08.050
APPROVE MEASURE HHH THEY WERE

01:18:08.116 --> 01:18:09.751
NOT THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:13.722
AVERAGE UNIT. OF OF HOUSING TO

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:15.791
BE BUILT TO BE BETWEEN. YOU KNOW

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:18.026
WELL FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:19.027
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SEVEN

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:20.195
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. I KNOW

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:22.898
THAT WAY WHEN I. VISITED OF THE

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.599
SOME OF THE THAT THE UNITS THAT

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:26.835
THE IS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT. I

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:29.838
MEAN I YOU KNOW I. IT WAS BETTER

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:31.273
THAN THE APARTMENT THAT I LIVE

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:33.341
IN IN SACRAMENTO YOU KNOW AND-

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:35.177
AND IN THE MEANTIME THERE ARE

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:37.212
PEOPLE. YOU KNOW FIFTEEN HUNDRED

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:39.081
PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED HOMELESS.

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:40.382
YOU KNOW THREE TO FOUR PEOPLE A

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:42.751
DAY SO WHEN I SEE THAT I DON'T

01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:46.588
SEE IT AND IT TAKES. IT TAKES

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:47.222
FOUR TO SIX YEARS TO BUILD THESE

01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:49.825
UNITS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.793
WE'RE NOW PRIORITISING EVEN MORE

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.362
SO. YOU KNOW THE SHELTERS OVER

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:55.397
THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:57.365
I UNDERSTAND LONG TERM PERMANENT

01:18:57.432 --> 01:18:58.667
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS NEEDING.

01:18:58.733 --> 01:18:59.968
BUT IN THE MEANTIME PEOPLE ARE

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:02.304
DYING AND WE NEED TO SHOW THE

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:03.805
PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR THE TAX

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:05.040
INCREASE. TO ADDRESS THE

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:07.509
HOMELESS PROBLEM BY PRIORITIZING

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:12.714
SHELTERS. BUT I WOULD JUST SAY

01:19:12.781 --> 01:19:14.349
THAT IT MUST BE BOTH BANDS

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:15.750
BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE AWHILE TO

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:17.853
DO HOUSING AT THE END SO WE NEED

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.321
TO DO IMMEDIATE INTERIM HOUSING

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:21.490
SHELTERS. AND WE NEED TO ALSO

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:23.391
KEEP A PIPELINE GOING SO THAT

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:25.227
PEOPLE HAVE A PLACE TO MOVE TO.

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:26.962
DATE JUST LAST COMMENT IS IT WE

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.396
HAVE LIMIT WILL HAVE LIMITED

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:29.898
RESOURCES IT'S A MATTER

01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:33.568
PRIORITIES THANK YOU. AND I'M

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:34.136
GOING TO HAND IT OVER TO MR

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:40.775
BLOOM- THANK YOU- ONE OF BUT-

01:19:40.842 --> 01:19:42.544
THE SITUATIONS THAT WE FACE NOW

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.412
IS THAT ON A DAILY BASIS MORE

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:46.448
PEOPLE ARE ENTERING HOMELESSNESS

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.183
THAN WERE ACTUALLY HOUSING WE'VE

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:50.852
HEARD THAT- OVER THE LAST COUPLE

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:53.788
OF YEARS OVER AND OVER AGAIN-

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:56.958
HERE IN LOS ANGELES. SO WHAT IS

01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:59.094
THE ROLE OF PREVENTION KEEPING

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:00.996
PEOPLE IN THEIR EXISTING

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:03.665
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO- THEY

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:05.467
DON'T. END UP ON THE STREET IN

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:12.107
THE FIRST PLACE. THANK YOU FOR

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:13.808
RAISING THAT ACTUALLY PREVENTION

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:15.477
IS ESSENTIAL AS YOU'RE SAYING WE

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:16.545
HAVE MORE PEOPLE FALLING INTO

01:20:16.611 --> 01:20:17.612
HOMELESSNESS EACH DAY THAT WE

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:19.481
HAD X. HITTING IT DESPITE ALL OF

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:21.082
THE NEW INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAVE

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:23.418
MADE AND IS CONTINUING GROWTH-

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.153
PREVENTION IS VERY COMPLICATED

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:25.754
THERE'S THE PIECE THAT YOU'RE

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.055
TALKING ABOUT ABOUT KEEPING

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:28.323
PEOPLE IN THE HOUSING THAT

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.658
THEY'RE IN RIGHT NOW. WHICH IS

01:20:29.724 --> 01:20:31.026
ABSOLUTELY THE MOST ESSENTIAL

01:20:31.092 --> 01:20:32.661
THING A SODA SOMEBODY FALLS INTO

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:33.328
HOMELESSNESS THE COSTS

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:34.529
ASSOCIATED WITH GETTING HOUSE

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:36.331
BEGAN AND THE LENGTH OF TIME IT

01:20:36.398 --> 01:20:37.899
TAKES JUST TO GET AT IT.

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:39.401
SACRAMENTO EXPONENTIALLY MORE

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:42.003
COMPLICATED- AND SO HELPING WITH

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:44.206
YOU KNOW IF EXTEND- PREVENTION

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:47.375
LEGAL DEFENSE OF HELPING- WITH-

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:49.010
PREVENTING FORECLOSURES AMONG

01:20:49.077 --> 01:20:51.313
LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS ALL OF

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:52.514
THOSE ARE EXTREMELY EXTREMELY

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:53.615
IMPORTANT AND THEN THERE'S A

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.984
LARGER SORT OF EVEN BACKING UP

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:57.118
FURTHER PREVENTION WHICH I KNOW

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.320
WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT

01:20:58.386 --> 01:20:59.788
TODAY BUT PREVENTION STARTS WAY

THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THEY HELPED

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:41.743
US PASSED. MEASURE H. WHICH

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:43.211
YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT. AND

01:24:43.278 --> 01:24:44.746
MANY OF THOSE CITIES ACROSS THE

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:46.581
COUNTY PARTICIPATED IN THAT WE

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:47.882
HAD TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THIS

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:49.317
WAS SOMETHING OF AN INVESTMENT

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:51.553
THAT THEY COULD GET A RETURN ON-

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:54.823
I WANT TO SAY THAT- THUS FAR-

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:57.192
WE'VE LEARNED. THROUGH OUR OWN-

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:59.794
MISTAKES. AND PROGRESS. THAT

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:01.763
THERE'S STILL A LOT TO BE DONE-

01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:03.231
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE FOR

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:09.170
EXAMPLE- SINCE A- JULY ABOVE

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:09.737
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:12.340
THOUSAND. PEOPLE THAT THE EXIT

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:13.908
HOMELESSNESS INTO PERMANENT

01:25:13.975 --> 01:25:15.643
HOUSING THAT'S SINCE TWO

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:16.211
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT MAY

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:18.112
SOUND OKAY. BUT WHEN YOU'RE

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:19.681
REALLY LOOKING AT ANNUALLY EVERY

01:25:19.747 --> 01:25:22.684
YEAR YOU SEE MORE THAN. SIXTY

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:23.318
SIX THOUSAND EIGHT IN AN UPWARD

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:24.619

TELL THE DOC INSTEAD OF HELPING

TO LEAD AND I THINK WE CAN DO A

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:33.461
LOT MORE THERE I REALLY BELIEVE

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:35.196
THAT. AND I THINK THAT WHAT I'VE

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:36.264
HEARD ALREADY FROM OTHERS

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:38.032
SPEAKERS IS THAT THERE HAS TO BE

01:25:38.099 --> 01:25:40.435
A PARALLEL TRACK HERE. I GET IT

01:25:40.502 --> 01:25:42.103
THE PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO SEE

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:44.506
FOLKS OUTSIDE NOBODY SHOULD HAVE

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:45.940
TO BE HUMILIATE THE MILLIE AIDED

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:47.342
IN THAT MATTER ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:50.411
IT COMES TO- WOMEN WOMEN WITH

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:51.646
CHILDREN. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:25:51.713 --> 01:25:53.248
FACILITIES TO DEAL WITH THE

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:55.216
GROWING NUMBER OF WOMEN AND

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:57.051
THEIR CHILDREN. AND WE NEED TO

01:25:57.118 --> 01:25:58.386
WE REALLY NEED TO PRIORITIZE

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:00.188
THAT TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:01.122
LONG BEFORE MANY OF US WERE

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:03.358
HERE- THERE WAS A CHANGING THE

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:04.526
TRAJECTORY IN TERMS OF HOW YOU

01:26:04.592 --> 01:26:05.827
DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH BILL%

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:07.695
ILLNESS. SUBSTANCE ABUSE WE KNOW

01:26:07.762 --> 01:26:09.297
THAT STORY WE DON'T WE DON'T

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:11.299
EVEN HAVE ENOUGH- BOARDING CARE

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:13.234
FACILITIES THEIR CLOSING LIKE

01:26:13.301 --> 01:26:15.136
THAT. THOSE ARE FACILITIES THAT

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:16.538
WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN RIGHT

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:18.206
AWAY AND PUTTING MONEY AND

01:26:18.273 --> 01:26:20.241
PUTTING OUR STOCK IN THAT. LAST

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:22.610
TIME- I THINK OF ASSEMBLY

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:25.179
MEMBER. SANTIAGO WE JOINED THE

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:27.081
GOVERNOR AT A FACILITY THAT WAS

01:26:27.148 --> 01:26:28.983
IN OUR DISTRICT THAT IS ACTUALLY

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:31.719
OF WAS WAS- GIVEN A LIFEBOAT. SO

01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:33.121
THAT THEY COULD PROVIDE

01:26:33.187 --> 01:26:35.023
ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE THAT DON'T

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:38.092
NEED A CUTE ASSISTANCE AND IT'S

01:26:38.159 --> 01:26:40.094
LESS COSTLY BUT DO IT THROUGH

01:26:40.161 --> 01:26:41.262
BOARDING CARE TYPES OF

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:43.531
FACILITIES AT THE PEPPER ALL OF

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:45.166
OUR CITIES ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS.

01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:47.335
THOSE HAVE BEEN CLOSED- THAT

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:49.203
MODEL I THINK HAS TO BE REVAMPED

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:50.605
IN THE AND WE HAVE A ROLE THERE

01:26:50.672 --> 01:26:51.906
I THINK THAT THE COUNTY OF LOS

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:53.241
ANGELES AND THE VARIOUS CITIES

01:26:53.308 --> 01:26:55.043
AND I'M GONNA SPEAK. NOT JUST

01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.977
ABOUT THE CITY OF LA BECAUSE

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:57.178
THEY'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB WE

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:59.180
HAVE BEEN ACTIS REALLY TRYING TO

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:00.315
FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DO A

01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:01.316
BETTER JOB THERE'S A LOT OF

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:02.817
CRITICISM THAT COULD BE THROWN.

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:06.888
AT ANY ONE OF US ANY SINGLE DAY

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:07.522
BUT I WILL SAY YOU YOU THAT SOME

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:08.156
OF US. DO ONE TO SEE SOMETHING

01:27:08.222 --> 01:27:10.024
HAPPEN. AND I WOULD ASK YOU

01:27:10.091 --> 01:27:11.826
BECAUSE WE SEE A SURPLUS IN

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:13.561
CALIFORNIA THIRTY ONE BILLION

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:15.363
DOLLARS. THAT WE REALLY CAN'T BE

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:17.599
CHEAP ON THIS ISSUE. AND I WILL

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:19.033
POINT OUT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS

WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF WHERE

01:28:43.685 --> 01:28:46.888
WE NEED TO GO IN PART OF IT WAS.

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:48.556

TO TRY TO GET MORE PEOPLE ENGAGE

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:54.729
TO BUILD OUT THIS SO CALLED NEW

DEPARTMENT SO TO SPEAK. WE HIRED

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:58.266
PEOPLE FROM OUR NEIGHBORING

01:28:58.332 --> 01:29:00.068
CITIES FROM THE SAN GABRIEL

VALLEY IN PARTICULAR. COME AND

01:29:02.103 --> 01:29:03.604
WORK FOR LASSA WHICH IS GREAT

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:05.106
BUT GUESS WHAT WE DIDN'T BACK

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:08.076
FILL. THOSE POSITIONS. SO IN THE

01:29:08.142 --> 01:29:10.278
SOUTH GATE AREA IN THE GATEWAY

01:29:10.344 --> 01:29:12.180
AREAS WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:14.115
BIG VACUUM IN TERMS OF STAFFING.

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:15.883
AND WE CAN'T JUST TAKE OUR EYE

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:17.852
OFF. OFF THE- MARKER THERE WE

01:29:17.919 --> 01:29:20.188
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FEED THAT

01:29:20.254 --> 01:29:22.256
SYSTEM. AND WE NEED TO ENGAGE

01:29:22.323 --> 01:29:23.791
NOT JUST OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:25.226

01:29:25.293 --> 01:29:27.462
EXPERIENCES. TO GET THEM

01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:30.098
TRAINED. DOES IT WANT TO BECOME

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:31.432
PARTNERS WITH US SO THAT THEY

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:33.534
BECOME OUR TEAMS THAT ARE OUT

01:29:33.601 --> 01:29:35.069
THERE. AND THEY CAN SPEAK THE

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:36.604
LANGUAGE WE NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:38.139
MORE TRULY. CULTURALLY

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:40.575
COMPETENT. TO DEAL IN ALL OF OUR

01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:42.076
DIFFERENT DISTRICTS BECAUSE WE

01:29:42.143 --> 01:29:44.746
HAVE PEOPLE THAT SPEAK WHAT OVER

01:29:44.812 --> 01:29:45.279
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OR MORE

01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:46.414
LANGUAGES. IN THE COUNTY OF LOS

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:48.182
ANGELES WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO

01:29:48.249 --> 01:29:50.251
HIRE PEOPLE UP AND PAY THEM GOOD

01:29:50.318 --> 01:29:52.687
WAGES FOR THAT AS WELL. AND NOT.

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.622
NOT PICK FROM ONE OF PART OF THE

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:56.424
CITY OR THE COUNTY AND BRING

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:58.493
THEM ALL INTO ONE AREA WE NEED

01:29:58.559 --> 01:29:59.794
TO HAVE A FORM TEAM AND THAT

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.028
COSTS MONEY THAT'S OPERATIONAL

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:03.064
COSTS. AND THENIF WE ARE GOING

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:04.332
TO BE CHARGED THE COUNTY TO DEAL

01:30:04.398 --> 01:30:06.200
WITH OPERATIONAL COSTS. AND WE

01:30:06.267 --> 01:30:07.502
ALSO NEED TO BE ACCOUNTABLE

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:09.070
ABOUT THAT AS WELL. AND KEEP IN

01:30:09.137 --> 01:30:10.505
MIND MANY OF THE SOURCES OF

01:30:10.571 --> 01:30:12.006
FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE. ARE

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:14.342
TIED TO FORMULAS WHY DON'T WE

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:16.444
HAVE. AN URGENCY TO LOOK AT HOW

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:18.012
YOU DE COUPLE THAT AND IT ISN'T

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.280
JUST THIS THE COUNTY OR THE

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:20.715
STATE IT'S ALSO THE FEDERAL

01:30:20.782 --> 01:30:22.350
GOVERNMENT. SO THEY ALSO HAVE TO

01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:23.484
BE A PART OF THIS DISCUSSION

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:25.453
WITH A SO I AGREE SOMEONE. SAID

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:26.854

THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:32.527
ADMINISTRATION I BELIEVE THAT WE

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:34.662
COULD DO THINGS WITH HUD. WE CAN

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:37.965
DO. WE CAN DO OF JOB CREATION

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:39.233

INTERIM. HOUSING LEVEL TO GET

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:44.405
THEM INTO JOB TRAINING AND THEN

01:30:44.472 --> 01:30:47.475
BEGIN TO HELP THEM BECOME MORE

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:48.342
RISK BILLION. AND THERE ARE

01:30:48.409 --> 01:30:49.510
PROGRAMS WE CAN SET UP TO DO

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:51.312
THAT THE COUNTY ALREADY IS. IS

01:30:51.379 --> 01:30:53.181
PILOTING PROGRAMS TO DO THAT WE

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:54.715
WANT TO HIRE UP THE VERY PEOPLE

THAT. TO BE PLACED IN THOSE

01:31:03.858 --> 01:31:05.526
PARTICULAR SETTINGS WHERE WE ARE

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:07.895

YOU TO THINK ABOUT- I KNOW THE

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:11.499
COST OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE

01:31:11.566 --> 01:31:14.268
HOUSING IT'S ASTRONOMICAL. AND

01:31:14.335 --> 01:31:15.303
WE'RE WE'RE IN THIS MODE NOW

01:31:15.369 --> 01:31:17.405
WERE. MANY PEOPLE DON'T WANT

DEVELOPERS DON'T WANT TO ENTER

01:31:18.506 --> 01:31:20.274
INTO THAT FIELD BECAUSE OF. THE

01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:21.843
COMPLEX LICENSING PERMITTING

OTHER THAN. A SHELTER FOR

01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:45.233
HOMELESS PEOPLE AND WE DID IT

CONTAINERS. THE COST IS BEEN

01:32:54.268 --> 01:32:55.903
REDUCED MORE THAN HALF SO YOU'RE

01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:57.872

OR- GRANTING. SOME PROPERTY THAT

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:17.692
KEPT THAT THAT THE STATE OWNED

01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:19.527

BECOMING ENCAMPMENTS. WHY DON'T

01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:29.437
WE START TARGETING THOSE AREAS.

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:31.739
IT'LL BE LOW COST GIVE IT OVER

01:33:31.806 --> 01:33:33.107

PERMANENT. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:40.915
DEAL WITH WITH US CITIES OUTSIDE

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.322
PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT NOW

01:33:48.389 --> 01:33:49.690
THEY'RE LIVING IN THE WATERSHED

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:51.625

WANT THAT. WE WANT A BETTER LIFE

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:57.398

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:58.733
THEM UP SCOOP THEM UP AND SEND

01:33:58.799 --> 01:33:59.900

FACILITIES ALSO. INDICATED AREAS

01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:04.438
IN CITIES THAT ARE TO SMALLER

01:34:04.505 --> 01:34:06.674
CITIES. THAT ARE RIGHT NOW GOING

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:09.310
THROUGH NIMBYISM. I'VE I'VE HAD

01:34:09.377 --> 01:34:11.679
TO DEAL WITH THAT. FOR THE LAST.

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:13.547
THREE YEARS NOW. AND IT'S BEEN

01:34:13.614 --> 01:34:15.116
VERY HARD BUT I WILL SAY THAT

01:34:15.182 --> 01:34:16.384
THERE IS SOME ENCOURAGEMENT.

01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:18.252
THROUGH THE TRUST FUND THAT YOU

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:19.720
WILL HELP TO ESTABLISH I THINK

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:21.756
CENTER RUBIO. HAD SOME FUNDING

01:34:21.822 --> 01:34:23.591

VALLEY CAUGHT. SHE PUT IN I

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:26.660
THINK FIVE MILLION I THINK SHE'S

01:34:26.727 --> 01:34:27.895
GOING TO PUT TWENTY WE PUT IN

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:30.197
ALSO MONEY. SO IT ISN'T AS

01:34:30.264 --> 01:34:31.198
THOUGH WE'RE SAYING GIVE ME A

01:34:31.265 --> 01:34:32.967
HAND OUT WE'RE SAYING WILL HELP

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:36.604
MATCH YOU. IN THE WAY THAT WE-CAN. BUT TO START BILL DOES

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:37.972
BRIDGE BUILDING THOSE BRIDGES

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:39.607
WITH SOME OF OUR CITIES. THE

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:41.742
OTHER EIGHTY SEVEN CITIES IS

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:43.110
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALL OF

01:34:43.177 --> 01:34:47.314
YOU REPRESENT DIFFERENT AREAS.

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:47.915
THROUGHOUT THIS THE COUNTY OF

01:34:47.982 --> 01:34:48.582
LOS ANGELES AND IF WE REALLY ARE

01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:49.917
GOING TO BEAT THIS OR LOOK AT

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:51.886
OTHER- MECHANISMS THEN WE HAVE

01:34:51.952 --> 01:34:53.287
TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS AND

01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:55.256
ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL. I

01:34:55.322 --> 01:34:56.724
WILL TELL YOU THAT IT DOES NOT

01:34:56.791 --> 01:35:00.728
WORK THAT WAY- WE OPENED UP. OF

01:35:00.795 --> 01:35:02.129
TWENTY SEVEN I THINK TINY HOMES

01:35:02.196 --> 01:35:04.965
INVOLVED PARK. NEXT TO A LOT

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:06.901
THAT THE CITY OWNED. SO ENGAGE

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:09.170
CITIES CITIES TO HELP PROPERTY

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:10.504
THAT ARE THAT ARE JUST SITTING

01:35:10.571 --> 01:35:12.840
THERE IDLE WHY COULDN'T WE START

01:35:12.907 --> 01:35:14.442
TO LOOK AT HOW STRATEGICALLY WE

01:35:14.508 --> 01:35:16.110
CAN PLAN. TO BUILD MORE HOUSING

01:35:16.177 --> 01:35:18.579
UP MAKE IT SAFE MAKE IT SECURE

01:35:18.646 --> 01:35:20.114
BUT CONTINUE TO HAVE. THIS

01:35:20.181 --> 01:35:21.649
DISCUSSION THAT IT HAS TO BE

01:35:21.715 --> 01:35:23.250
ONGOING OPERATIONAL BUT SO THE

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:24.185
FIRST THING THE CITY OF

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:25.986
BALLPARK. AND SOME OF OUR OTHER

01:35:26.053 --> 01:35:27.021
CITIES ARE TELLING US KILL THE

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:28.756
WILL ENGAGE WITH YOU MONTEBELLO

01:35:28.823 --> 01:35:31.058
WILL- AND OTHER CITIES. BUT THEY

01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:32.126
WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE OPERATE

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:33.461
OPERATING COSTS ARE GOING TO

01:35:33.527 --> 01:35:34.628
COME THAT IS GOING TO COME OUT

01:35:34.695 --> 01:35:36.630
OF MEASURE H. THERE IS NOT

01:35:36.697 --> 01:35:38.866
ENOUGH MONEY. AND THAT IS GOING

01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:40.601
TO END IN SEVERAL YEARS SO WE

01:35:40.668 --> 01:35:42.169
KNOW IF I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO GO

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:43.270
BACK OR WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO

01:35:43.337 --> 01:35:45.039
GO BACK. TO OUR TAXPAYERS WOULD

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:46.807
HAVE TO SHOW THEM SOME RESULTS.

01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:48.309
AND WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SAY IT

01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:49.643
IN A WAY THAT ALL OF US ARE

01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:51.479
REALLY ENGAGED. SO I WOULD

01:35:51.545 --> 01:35:53.614
REALLY ASK FOR THAT AND I WOULD

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:54.882
INVITE YOU AGAIN TO PLEASE COME

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:57.017
OUT AND VISIT. THE VILLAGE THAT

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:59.487
WE PUT UP. IT HAS A DOG PARK

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:00.754
THERE IS A SEPARATE FACILITY

01:36:00.821 --> 01:36:02.957
THAT HAS A KITCHEN. A STATE OF

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:04.091
THE ART KITCHEN THAT WILL BE

01:36:04.158 --> 01:36:05.993
USED AS SOON AS IT'S POP PROPPED

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.697
UP. FOR TRAINING CULINARY ARTS.

01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:11.765
NO BIG IDEA THERE JUST. PUT THE

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:13.100
KITCHEN TO USE THE PEOPLE THAT

01:36:13.167 --> 01:36:15.369
LIVE THERE. ALSO FACILITIES THAT

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:16.871
ARE THAT ARE IN A CONTAINED AREA

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:18.839
WHERE. THERE'S A WASHERS DRYERS

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:20.841
AND ALL OF THAT. EVERYBODY THAT

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:23.310
COMES IN IS DIAGNOSED TO GET

01:36:23.377 --> 01:36:25.212
CASE. BIGGEST CASE MANAGEMENT.

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:27.047
AND IT'S BEING DONE THERE'S- A

01:36:27.114 --> 01:36:28.349
LIKE I SAID THERE'S EVEN A DOG

01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:29.850
PARK THERE I MEAN WHO WOULD

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:31.585
THINK OF THAT. RIGHT BECAUSE

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:33.087
MANY OF OUR HOMELESS ARE

01:36:33.154 --> 01:36:35.623
ATTACHED TO THEIR PETS. AND THEY

01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:37.191
WON'T GO INTO SHELTERS UNLESS

01:36:37.258 --> 01:36:38.759
THEY CAN BRING THEIR PETS. SO

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:40.561
WHY ARE WE DENYING PEOPLE.

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.730
THINGS THAT. THEY HELP THEM.

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:45.132
FEEL FEEL BETTER ABOUT WHO THEY

01:36:45.199 --> 01:36:47.568
ARE- ONE THING I WILL I WILL SAY

01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:48.736
TO YOU. AND SOME OF YOU HEARD

01:36:48.802 --> 01:36:51.438
THIS I THINK- THAT WERE THAT

01:36:51.505 --> 01:36:53.541
WERE- IT WAS LAST YEAR TOO WHEN

01:36:53.607 --> 01:36:55.142
WE WENT UP TO SACRAMENTO TO TALK

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:56.844
TO THE DELEGATION. ABOUT HELPING

01:36:56.911 --> 01:36:58.879
US FIND A RESTORATIVE CARE

01:36:58.946 --> 01:37:00.614
VILLAGES AND WHAT I'M SAYING

01:37:00.681 --> 01:37:02.616
THERE IS THAT KELLY C. WITH C.

01:37:02.683 --> 01:37:04.585
FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE ALREADY

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:05.653
BUILT I'D SAY ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:07.788
AND OF. A HUNDRED AND SIXTY

01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:11.058
UNITS OF RECUPERATIVE BEDS. BEDS

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:14.161
AND THAT MEANS SO THE- WE'RE

01:37:14.228 --> 01:37:15.296
WE'RE LOOKING AT NOT JUST

01:37:15.362 --> 01:37:16.463
LOCKING PEOPLE UP BECAUSE IT

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.831
ISN'T ABOUT THAT IT'S GIVING

01:37:17.898 --> 01:37:18.699
THEM THE TREATMENT THAT THEY

01:37:18.766 --> 01:37:20.467
NEED. SO THEY COME OUT OF JAIL

01:37:20.534 --> 01:37:21.368
OR THE COME OUT OF BEING

01:37:21.435 --> 01:37:24.104
HOMELESS ON THE STREET. WE CAN

01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:25.339
WE CAN ATTACH THE HEALTH CARE

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:27.541
UNIT IT'S RIGHT ADJACENT THERE

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:29.643
THEY CAN GET THE APPROPRIATE.

01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:31.078
MEDICAL TREATMENT. AND THEN

01:37:31.145 --> 01:37:32.680
HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO STEP DOWN

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:34.848
FROM THOSE UNITS. THAT THAT

01:37:34.915 --> 01:37:37.218
FACILITY WILL BE OPEN IN SPRING.

01:37:37.284 --> 01:37:38.752

01:37:38.819 --> 01:37:40.287
SOMEBODY WILL COME AND VISIT US

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:41.455
BECAUSE THAT FACILITY THE

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:42.690
BUILDINGS ARE ALREADY PHYSICALLY

01:37:42.756 --> 01:37:44.291

01:40:13.507 --> 01:40:16.276
TENANTS- THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE

01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:17.578
AMOUNT OF MONEY BOTH FROM THE

01:40:17.644 --> 01:40:18.479
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE

01:40:18.545 --> 01:40:19.880
STATE GOVERNMENT. HAS GONE

01:40:19.947 --> 01:40:21.281
TOWARDS RENTERS TO HELP THEM

01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:22.616
STAY HOUSED DURING THIS

01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:25.419
PANDEMIC. WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND

01:40:25.486 --> 01:40:26.687
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR EFFORTS

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:28.188
IN OUR DISTRICT. IS THAT WE'VE

01:40:28.255 --> 01:40:30.124
ACTUALLY GONE DOOR TO DOOR IN

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:31.291
APARTMENT BUILDINGS- IN OUR

01:40:31.358 --> 01:40:32.726
DISTRICT OUR STAFF HAS IN A

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:34.962
QUORUM VOLUNTEERS. HAS GONE DOOR

01:40:35.028 --> 01:40:36.730
TO DOOR AND WHAT WE FOUND IN

01:40:36.797 --> 01:40:38.999
THAT WORK. IS THAT. THERE IS

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:42.136
STILL A NEED FOR BETTER PATHWAYS

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:44.571
BETWEEN STRUGGLING TENANTS AND

01:40:44.638 --> 01:40:45.439
THE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE

01:40:45.506 --> 01:40:46.940
AVAILABLE TO THEM. EVEN WHEN

01:40:47.007 --> 01:40:49.109
THAT FUNDING IS GIVEN TO US THE

01:40:49.176 --> 01:40:50.878
MONEY TO ACTUALLY CREATE THOSE

01:40:50.944 --> 01:40:52.646
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN TENANTS. AND

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:53.747
THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE RIGHTS

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:54.915
AND RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE

01:40:54.982 --> 01:40:56.650
AVAILABLE TO THEM IS STILL VERY

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:58.252
MUCH MISSING. FOR EXAMPLE IN MY

01:40:58.318 --> 01:40:59.153
OWN DISTRICT WHICH IS A

01:40:59.219 --> 01:41:01.588
RELATIVELY HIGH RESOURCE- MOSTLY

01:41:01.655 --> 01:41:03.690
ENGLISH SPEAKING DISTRICT- WE'VE

01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:06.260
DISTRIBUTED THOUSANDS. OF PIECES

01:41:06.326 --> 01:41:07.928
OF LITERATUREAT DOORS WE'VE HAD

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:09.797
OVER SIX HUNDRED CONVERSATIONS

01:41:09.863 --> 01:41:11.598
WITH HOUSEHOLDS. AND A HUGE

01:41:11.665 --> 01:41:13.300
NUMBER OF THEM WERE BEHIND ON

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:15.602
THEIR RENT AND WERE NOT AWARE.

01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:17.137
OF THE KIND OF DOLLARS THAT THEY

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:19.406
WERE ELIGIBLE FOR FROM THE CITY

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:20.374
FROM THE STATE AND FROM THE

01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:21.742
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHICH WAS

01:41:21.809 --> 01:41:23.911
ASTOUNDING TO US- AND SO MAKING

01:41:23.977 --> 01:41:25.546
THOSE OTHER CONNECTIONS TO

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:27.414
WHENEVER YOU FIND RESOURCES FOR

01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:29.416
TENANTS. TO HELP THEM STAY HOUSE

01:41:29.483 --> 01:41:30.551
TO HELP PEOPLE STAY IN THEIR

01:41:30.617 --> 01:41:32.753
HOMES. TO ALSO IN THE SAME

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:34.655
BREATH FUND RESOURCES TO MAKE

01:41:34.721 --> 01:41:35.989
SURE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE

01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:37.925
RESOURCES. IS GETTING OUT TO THE

01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:39.259
PEOPLE WHO MOST DESPERATELY NEED

01:41:39.326 --> 01:41:42.095
IT. THAT'S A MISSING PIECE THAT

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:42.696
I THINK THE STATE AND THE CITY

01:41:42.763 --> 01:41:43.330
CAN DO MUCH BETTER IN FUNDING

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:45.299
TOGETHER. THE SECOND THING WHICH

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:46.467
IS REALLY WORKED IN OUR

01:41:46.533 --> 01:41:49.136
DISTRICT. HAS BEEN FOCUSED PLACE

01:41:49.203 --> 01:41:51.138
BASED EFFORTS AT HOUSING FOLKS

01:41:51.205 --> 01:41:53.006
SO WHAT'S SO WHAT'S BEEN CALLED

01:41:53.073 --> 01:41:54.842
THE IN CAMERA TO HOME. A KIND OF

01:41:54.908 --> 01:41:56.777
MODEL AT GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:59.079
STREETS- THAT'S FOCUSED EFFORTS

01:41:59.146 --> 01:42:01.215
AT SINGLE ENCAMPMENTS. YOU WORK

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:03.484
WITH THEM OVER TIME AND YOU WORK

01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:06.053
WITH THEM TO GET PEOPLE. INDOORS

01:42:06.119 --> 01:42:07.955
AND IT'S WORKED BECAUSE OF TWO

01:42:08.021 --> 01:42:10.357
REASONS ONE IT'S BECAUSE WHEN

01:42:10.424 --> 01:42:12.226
YOU HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE. WHO

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:13.861
ARE AT ENCAMPMENTS OFTEN

01:42:13.927 --> 01:42:15.496
PARTICULARLY IN THIS PERIOD WHEN

01:42:15.562 --> 01:42:17.130
ENCAMPMENTS HAVE BEEN THERE FOR

01:42:17.197 --> 01:42:18.732
A LONG TIME PEOPLE IN THOSE

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:20.033
ENCAMPMENTS HAVE ALSO BUILT UP A

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:20.801
SENSE OF COMMUNITY WITH ONE

01:42:20.868 --> 01:42:22.903
ANOTHER. AND SO HELPING PEOPLE

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:25.105
TO MOVE INDOORS WITH THAT

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:26.540
COMMUNITY OR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:27.975
THAT COMMUNITY HAVING SOMEONE

01:42:28.041 --> 01:42:29.343
FROM THAT COMMUNITY GO INDOORS

01:42:29.409 --> 01:42:30.410
COME BACK OUT TO THE NGAGEMENT

01:42:30.477 --> 01:42:32.513
AND SAY. HEY IT'S GREAT IN THERE

01:42:32.579 --> 01:42:34.915
COME WITH ME THAT HAS REALLY

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:37.618
WORKED AT ACTUALLY HELPING US

01:42:37.684 --> 01:42:39.620
TO- GET EVERYONE HOUSE AT A

01:42:39.686 --> 01:42:40.621
PARTICULAR IN CANTON AND HAVE

01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:42.189
THAT ENCAMPMENTS STAY CLEAR GO

01:42:42.256 --> 01:42:43.924
ON AN ONGOING BASIS. IT'S REALLY

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:45.492
REALLY REMARKABLE IT'S ALSO

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:47.494
WORKED BECAUSE RESOURCES ARE

01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:49.596
SUPER SCARCE FOR OUTRAGE I KNOW

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:50.797
THERE'S A LOT MORE DOLLARS IN

01:42:50.864 --> 01:42:52.165
IT. AND IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT

01:42:52.232 --> 01:42:53.433
SHOULD BE SCARCE BUT IT IS

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:56.003
SCARCE AND IT'S ALSO FRAGMENTED.

01:42:56.069 --> 01:42:57.804
IT'S HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND SO

01:42:57.871 --> 01:42:59.339
WHAT ENCAMPMENTS HOME OPERATION

01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:00.541
DOES IS THAT IT HELPS US TO

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:03.110
FOCUS IT BECOMES LIKE A WEEKLY

01:43:03.176 --> 01:43:04.444
MEETING THAT YOU CAN HAVE ABOUT

01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:06.313
A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS MONITOR

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:07.614
THEIR PROGRESS AND HELP THEM GO

01:43:07.681 --> 01:43:10.050
IN OVERTIME. IT FORCES YOU TO DO

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:11.752
THAT COORDINATION WORK THAT I

01:43:11.818 --> 01:43:12.819
THINK SHOULD BE HAPPENING SYSTEM

01:43:12.886 --> 01:43:15.489
WIDE ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT IT'S

01:43:15.556 --> 01:43:17.558
MUCH EASIER TO DO ON IN CANTON

01:43:17.624 --> 01:43:19.660
BY CANTON LEVEL. THE THIRD I

01:43:19.726 --> 01:43:20.661
THINK THAT HAS WORKED AND I

01:43:20.727 --> 01:43:22.329
THINK- SUPERVISORS LEASE YOU

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:24.131
MENTION THIS AS WELL A ROOM WITH

01:43:24.197 --> 01:43:26.300
THE DOOR. THE ABILITY TO HAVE A

01:43:26.366 --> 01:43:28.001
ROOM WITH THE DOOR TO OFFER

01:43:28.068 --> 01:43:29.269
INDIVIDUALS WHETHER IT'S A TINY

01:43:29.336 --> 01:43:31.838
HOME WHETHER IT IS A BIG NO

01:43:31.905 --> 01:43:34.474
STYLE FACILITY- WHETHER IT IS UP

01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:36.610
PRK ROOM WHETHER IT IS AN

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:37.978
APARTMENT IT KIND OF DOESN'T

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:39.379
MATTER WHAT KIND OF ROOM WITH

01:43:39.446 --> 01:43:41.248
THE DOOR IT IS. BUT THAT ROOM

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:42.516
WITH THE DOOR GETS PEOPLE

01:43:42.583 --> 01:43:44.384
INDOORS OVER AND OVER AGAIN SAYS

01:43:44.451 --> 01:43:45.919
YOU'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS FROM

01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:48.055
THE STATE LEVEL I WANT. THAT

01:43:48.121 --> 01:43:50.023
HELP TO BUILD MORE ROOMS WITH

01:43:50.090 --> 01:43:52.225
DOORS OR BY MORE ROOMS WITH

01:43:52.292 --> 01:43:53.493
DOORS THAT WE CAN OFFER TO

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.227
PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING

01:43:54.294 --> 01:43:55.729
HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THAT GETS

01:43:55.796 --> 01:43:57.998
US TO YES. OVER AND OVER AGAIN

01:43:58.065 --> 01:43:59.166
WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING

01:43:59.232 --> 01:44:00.968
HOMELESSNESS AND FINALLY I JUST

01:44:01.034 --> 01:44:02.169
WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING THAT I'M

01:44:02.235 --> 01:44:05.539
VERY PROUD OF FROM OUR OFFICE.

01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:06.173
BUT WHICH I THINK DOESN'T HAPPEN

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:06.840
A CRAW THE CITY FOR. THAT I CAN

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:07.608
TALK ABOUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT.

01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:09.743
WHAT HASN'T WORKED- IS THAT WHEN

01:44:09.810 --> 01:44:11.078
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING

01:44:11.144 --> 01:44:12.279
INTO FACILITIES WHETHER IT BE

01:44:12.346 --> 01:44:14.581
PRK WHETHER IT BE. OTHER KINDS

01:44:14.648 --> 01:44:16.249
OF INTERIM HOUSING FACILITIES

01:44:16.316 --> 01:44:17.651
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET PEOPLE IN

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:19.353
THOSE HOMES TRANSITION INTO

01:44:19.419 --> 01:44:20.687
PERMANENT HOUSING. BECAUSE WE

01:44:20.754 --> 01:44:21.922
HAVE THE STAFF TO DO THE FOLLOW

01:44:21.989 --> 01:44:23.890
UP. FIVE ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT

01:44:23.957 --> 01:44:25.459
PEOPLE I BELIEVE ON MY STAFF I

01:44:25.525 --> 01:44:27.160
HAVE A HOMELESSNESS TEAM OF

01:44:27.227 --> 01:44:28.762
THREE AND A HALF RIGHT NOW. AND

01:44:28.829 --> 01:44:30.063
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG INVESTMENT

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:31.231
IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING

01:44:31.298 --> 01:44:32.799
THE COORDINATION WORK. AND OUR

01:44:32.866 --> 01:44:35.369
COUNCIL DISTRICT LEVEL GIVE TWO

01:44:35.435 --> 01:44:35.969
HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:44:36.036 --> 01:44:36.570
ARE COUNCIL DISTRICTS I DON'T

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:37.771
THINK THAT'S A HUGE NUMBER. BUT

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:38.905
IT'S STILL IT'S AN INVESTMENT

01:44:38.972 --> 01:44:39.973
THAT I THINK IS MORE THAN MANY

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.041
OTHER COUNCIL DISTRICTS ARE

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:42.709
MAKING. AND BECAUSE WE'RE DOING

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.111
THE FOLLOW UP WITH PEOPLE WHO

01:44:44.177 --> 01:44:46.246
HAVE BEEN HOUSE. TO SAY HEY ARE

01:44:46.313 --> 01:44:47.681
YOU MOVING TO THAT NEXT STEP.

01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:49.583
WE'RE ABLE TO THEN ASK FOR THE

01:44:49.650 --> 01:44:51.184
RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO GET

01:44:51.251 --> 01:44:52.619
PEOPLE OT JUST INTO INTERIM

01:44:52.686 --> 01:44:54.021
HOUSING. BUT THEN TO MAKE THE

01:44:54.087 --> 01:44:55.155
TRANSITION INTO PERMANENT

01:44:55.222 --> 01:44:56.790
HOUSING. AND HEIDI KNOWS BECAUSE

01:44:56.857 --> 01:44:58.659
I'VE CALLED HER MANY TIMES TO

01:44:58.725 --> 01:45:01.294
BUG ER FOR THOSE RESOURCES-

01:45:01.361 --> 01:45:02.629
FINALLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:04.831
WHAT HASN'T WORKED- FIRST OF ALL

01:45:04.898 --> 01:45:06.233
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE GAPS IN

01:45:06.299 --> 01:45:08.235
OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- AND

01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:09.202
I THINK FUNDING CAN HELP

01:45:09.269 --> 01:45:10.537
ELIMINATE SOME OF THOSE GAPS I

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:11.772
JUST WANNA TALK ABOUT IT. FROM

01:45:11.838 --> 01:45:12.939
THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEONE WHO'S

01:45:13.006 --> 01:45:14.608
TRYING TO GET SOMEONE HELP. SO

01:45:14.675 --> 01:45:16.309
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN OUR STREETS

01:45:16.376 --> 01:45:18.345
IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT STREETS.

01:45:18.412 --> 01:45:20.547
WHO ARE VERY VERY SICK. AND THEY

01:45:20.614 --> 01:45:21.648
ARE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL

01:45:21.715 --> 01:45:23.684
ILLNESS. BUT THEY ARE NOT SICK

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:26.720
ENOUGH FOR OUR DMH- PRIMARY

01:45:26.787 --> 01:45:27.954
STREET BASED OUTREACH TEAM WHICH

01:45:28.021 --> 01:45:30.624
IS OUR HOME TEAM. TO GO OUT AND

01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:31.591
HELP THEM. SO THEY LITERALLY

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:33.393
HAVE TO WAIT. UNTIL THEY ARE

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:35.462
NEAR DEATH. FOR OUR DEPARTMENT

01:45:35.529 --> 01:45:36.296
OF MENTAL HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO

01:45:36.363 --> 01:45:38.198
GO OUT AND SERVE THEM. THAT IS

01:45:38.265 --> 01:45:39.700
OUTRAGEOUS AND IT IS

01:45:39.766 --> 01:45:42.069
HUMILIATING. FOR OUR CITY TO BE

01:45:42.135 --> 01:45:43.470
IN THAT POSITION. AND I THINK

01:45:43.537 --> 01:45:45.038
THE MORE THAT WE CAN FUNDED

01:45:45.105 --> 01:45:46.139
SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:45:46.206 --> 01:45:47.240
EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS

01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:48.809
INCLUDING. STREET BASED MENTAL

01:45:48.875 --> 01:45:50.877
HEALTH SERVICES. FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:45:50.944 --> 01:45:53.880
ARE. STRUGGLING BUT- WITH THE

01:45:53.947 --> 01:45:55.382
RIGHT RESOURCES CAN NAVIGATE

01:45:55.449 --> 01:45:58.351
INTO HOUSING AND CARE. BEFORE

01:45:58.418 --> 01:45:59.419
THEY GET SO SICK THA THEY ARE

01:45:59.486 --> 01:46:01.788
DYING. WE DESPERATELY NEED THAT

01:46:01.855 --> 01:46:02.823
AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT

01:46:02.889 --> 01:46:04.458
NOW. SIMILARLY I WOULD SAY THE

01:46:04.524 --> 01:46:05.625
SAME FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE

01:46:05.692 --> 01:46:06.593
RESOURCES RIGHT NOW WE ARE

01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:08.562
SEEING AN EXPLOSION OF MATH ON

01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:09.963
OUR STREETS. CHEMICAL

01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:11.932
COMPOSITIONS HAVE CHANGED. SUCH

01:46:11.998 --> 01:46:13.734
THAT WHAT PEOPLE ARE USING IS

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:15.102
AFFECTING THEM IN WAYS THAT I

01:46:15.168 --> 01:46:15.969
HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE JUST MY

01:46:16.036 --> 01:46:17.504
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. PEOPLE ARE

01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:19.506
SICKER. ON THE STREETS AND I

01:46:19.573 --> 01:46:21.541
HAVE SEEN THEM BEFORE BECAUSE OF

01:46:21.608 --> 01:46:22.509
THE NATURE OF THE DRUGS THAT ARE

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:24.678
AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. WE NEED

01:46:24.745 --> 01:46:27.013
RESOURCES. FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:28.615
WE NEED THEM DESPERATELY. AND

01:46:28.682 --> 01:46:30.183
THERE WAS A VERY EXCITING BILL A

01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:31.618
PUT FORWARD BY SENATOR SCOTT

01:46:31.685 --> 01:46:35.021
WIENER. ABOUT INCH SAFE

01:46:35.088 --> 01:46:36.156
INJECTION SITES WHICH DIDN'T

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:37.758
MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE STATE.

01:46:37.824 --> 01:46:40.193
ANY EVIDENCE BASED RESPONSE TO

01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:42.362

THAT IS GROWING- AND NEEDS NEEDS

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:50.003
HELP URGENTLY. FINALLY I WANT TO

01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:51.371
TALK ABOUT THE THING THAT REALLY

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:53.140
DOESN'T WORK FOR ME. WHICH IS

01:46:53.206 --> 01:46:54.174
THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A

01:46:54.241 --> 01:46:56.243
COORDINATED STRATEGY AT THE CITY

01:46:56.309 --> 01:46:57.744
FOR RESPONDING TO HOMELESSNESS.

01:46:57.811 --> 01:46:59.312
EACH COUNCIL DISTRICT GOES ITS

01:46:59.379 --> 01:47:01.248
OWN WAY- AND I THINK THAT

01:47:01.314 --> 01:47:02.582
HAPPENS IN THE COUNTY WITH ALL

01:47:02.649 --> 01:47:04.050
OF OUR CITIES SO I THINK IT'S A

01:47:04.117 --> 01:47:05.585
PARALLEL PROBLEM MAYBE IT

01:47:05.652 --> 01:47:08.355
HAPPENS AT THE STATE LEVEL. SURE

01:47:08.421 --> 01:47:09.523
AND AT THE CITY LEVEL THAT

01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:10.724
PROBLEM IS EVEN MORE ACUTE

01:47:10.791 --> 01:47:12.092
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE CHARGED WITH

01:47:12.159 --> 01:47:13.627
FINDING LAND FOR INTERIM

01:47:13.693 --> 01:47:15.295
HOUSING. THE PEOPLE CHARGED WITH

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:16.563
FINDING LAND FOR PERMANENT

01:47:16.630 --> 01:47:17.597
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AFFORDABLE

01:47:17.664 --> 01:47:19.800
HOUSING. ARE ALSO THE PEOPLE WHO

01:47:19.866 --> 01:47:21.501
WILL SUFFER THE MOST. SEVERE

01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:23.069
POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES FOR

01:47:23.136 --> 01:47:23.837
FINDING THAT HOUSING AND

01:47:23.904 --> 01:47:25.472
BUILDING THAT HOUSING. EVERY

01:47:25.539 --> 01:47:27.641
TIME I PUT FORWARD A SITE. FOR

01:47:27.707 --> 01:47:30.243
ANY ANY KIND OF CONSTRUCTION.

01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:31.344
WHETHER EVEN IF IT'S JUST A DROP

01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:33.547
IN CENTER. A ONCE A WEEK I GET A

01:47:33.613 --> 01:47:35.048
BUNCH OF CALLS COMPLAINING ABOUT

01:47:35.115 --> 01:47:37.484
IT. AND SO IT IS A DISINCENTIVE

01:47:37.551 --> 01:47:39.586
FOR ME EVEN THOUGH I. REALLY

01:47:39.653 --> 01:47:40.821
WANT TO DO IT I BECAUSE I KNOW

01:47:40.887 --> 01:47:42.355
IT'S NEEDED FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

01:47:42.422 --> 01:47:44.558
ADDRESS OUR OUR ISSUES. WE KNOW

01:47:44.624 --> 01:47:45.725
OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT WE

01:47:45.792 --> 01:47:47.861
CAN'T ARREST OR SWEEP OUR WAY

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:49.396
OUT OF THIS CRISIS THE ONLY WAY

01:47:49.462 --> 01:47:50.197
TO SUSTAINABLY ENDING

01:47:50.263 --> 01:47:51.798
HOMELESSNESS IS TO GET PEOPLE

01:47:51.865 --> 01:47:54.234
INTO HOUSING. IT TAKES TIME IT

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:56.403
TAKES PATIENCE AND YET THE

01:47:56.469 --> 01:47:57.537
PERSON WHO IS CHARGED WITH

01:47:57.604 --> 01:47:58.939
MAKING SURE THAT THAT PROCESS

01:47:59.005 --> 01:48:00.907
HAPPENS SUSTAINABLY HAPPENS

01:48:00.974 --> 01:48:02.542
SAFELY HAPPENS COMPASSIONATELY

01:48:02.609 --> 01:48:04.544
HAPPENS EFFECTIVELY THAT'S ME.

01:48:04.611 --> 01:48:05.912
I'M ALSO THE PERSON WHO GETS THE

01:48:05.979 --> 01:48:07.881
MOST PHONE CALLS. ABOUT ASKING

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:09.850
PEOPLE TO BE MOVED IMMEDIATELY

01:48:09.916 --> 01:48:11.218
FROM HOUSE RESIDENTS WERE

01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:13.153
UNDERSTANDABLY. AND I HAVE A LOT

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:14.654
OF EMPATHY FOR HOUSE AND HOUSE

01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:16.122
RESIDENTS IN THIS CASE THEY'RE

01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:17.757
UNDERSTANDABLY IMPATIENT. AND

01:48:17.824 --> 01:48:19.626
FRUSTRATED WITH OUR ABILITY TO

01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:21.261
MAKE PROGRESS ON THESE ISSUES.

01:48:21.328 --> 01:48:24.397
WE NEED. CENTRALIZATION WE NEED

01:48:24.464 --> 01:48:26.666
DECISION MAKING ABOUT HOUSING

01:48:26.733 --> 01:48:27.634
AND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO SITE

01:48:27.701 --> 01:48:28.902
HOUSING WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS

01:48:28.969 --> 01:48:30.670
HOUSING. THAT IS NOT BEING MADE

01:48:30.737 --> 01:48:32.105
AT THE COUNCIL DISTRICT LEVEL I

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:33.440
KNOW THAT'S WEIRD FOR ME TO SAY

01:48:33.506 --> 01:48:35.609
I DON'T WANT THAT- BUT I THINK

01:48:35.675 --> 01:48:37.043
FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR CITY TO

01:48:37.110 --> 01:48:38.078
BE ABLE TO RESPOND MORE

01:48:38.144 --> 01:48:39.746
EFFECTIVELY. IT HAS TO BE DONE

01:48:39.813 --> 01:48:40.780
IN A CENTRALIZED WAY AT THE

01:48:40.847 --> 01:48:42.649
CITY- IT HAS TO BE DONE AT THE

01:48:42.716 --> 01:48:44.484
CENTRALIZED WITH THE COUNTY- AND

01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:47.654
IT HAS TO BE SUPERCHARGED- AND I

01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:49.322
KNOW THE STATE HAS BEEN DOING A

01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:51.758
LOT ON HOUSING CONSTRUCTION- AND

01:48:51.825 --> 01:48:54.327
KIND OF EASING. PADS FOR HOUSING

01:48:54.394 --> 01:48:56.263
BEING BUILT- IN VARIOUS

01:48:56.329 --> 01:48:57.797
JURISDICTIONS. BUT I THINK THE

01:48:57.864 --> 01:48:59.032
STRATEGY NEEDS TO BE MORE

01:48:59.099 --> 01:49:00.700
THOUGHTFUL. AND IT NEEDS TO BE

01:49:00.767 --> 01:49:01.935

WHETHER IT BE GEOGRAPHICALLY

01:49:05.438 --> 01:49:07.307
FOCUSED WHETHER IT BE FOCUSED ON

01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:09.009
A PARTICULAR KIND OF HOUSING

SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:06.266
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND

01:50:06.333 --> 01:50:07.033
JUST TO PUT THAT INTO

01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:09.202
PERSPECTIVE OVER THE LAST THREE

01:50:09.269 --> 01:50:12.005
YEARS OUR SYSTEM HAS HOUSED

01:50:12.072 --> 01:50:13.340
SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SO IT

FURTHER OUT WITH OUR TWENTY

01:50:23.783 --> 01:50:25.585
TWENTY NUMBERS IT LOOKS LIKE TWO

01:50:25.652 --> 01:50:26.886
HUNDRED AND FIVE PEOPLE BEING

01:50:51.778 --> 01:50:53.313
FLAW AND IT'S NOT AN INDIVIDUAL

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:54.914
SHORTCOMINGS. BUT IT'S A DIRECT

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:57.017
ESULT OF THE SYSTEM AND POLICY

01:50:57.083 --> 01:50:59.052

01:51:17.137 --> 01:51:19.239
MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR. AND SO ALL OF

01:51:19.305 --> 01:51:20.306
THIS IS TO SAY THAT WE CAN

01:51:20.373 --> 01:51:22.742
ABSOLUTELY DESIGN SYSTEMS THAT

01:52:21.034 --> 01:52:23.103
AT THE LA CITIES L. A. COUNTY

01:52:23.169 --> 01:52:24.304
OUR COMMUNITY REALLY CAME

01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:26.005
TOGETHER AND WE SAT A COLLECTIVE

01:52:26.072 --> 01:52:27.507
TARGET AT ALL LEVELS OF

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:29.042
GOVERNMENT AND SAID OUR FIRST

01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:30.510
PRIORITY IS TO GET PEOPLE

01:52:30.577 --> 01:52:31.945
INSIDE. WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:52:32.011 --> 01:52:33.480
PRIVILEGE OF SHELTERING IN PLACE

01:52:33.546 --> 01:52:34.981
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE COPA

01:52:35.048 --> 01:52:36.316
NINETEEN PANDEMIC. SO IN A

01:52:36.382 --> 01:52:38.284
MATTER OF WEEKS OUR COLLECTIVE

01:52:38.351 --> 01:52:40.053
EFFORTS BROUGHT THIRTY HOTELS

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:41.321
AND MOTELS ONLINE THROUGH

01:52:41.387 --> 01:52:43.756
PROJECT ROOM HE- AND THIS FEMA

01:52:43.823 --> 01:52:45.091
BASS COVE IT RESPONSE THAT

01:52:45.158 --> 01:52:46.359
REALLY ALLOWED CITIES AND

01:52:46.426 --> 01:52:47.560
COUNTIES AND STATES TO BE

01:52:47.627 --> 01:52:49.162
REIMBURSED. AND TO HAVE A WAY

01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:51.831
FORWARD. AND AT ITS PEAK IN LA

01:52:51.898 --> 01:52:53.399
THERE WERE THIRTY SEVEN PROJECT

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:56.035
ROOM KEY SITES WITH ABOUT THIRTY

01:52:56.102 --> 01:52:57.470
SIX HUNDRED ROOMS WHICH IS MORE

01:52:57.537 --> 01:52:58.171
THAN ANY OTHER REGION IN THE

01:52:58.238 --> 01:53:00.907
COUNTRY. AND SO APPEAR K. REALLY

01:53:00.974 --> 01:53:02.742
TAUGHT US IS THAT WHEN WE ALL

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:04.477
COME TOGETHER AT ACROSS ALL

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:06.346
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT ACROSS

01:53:06.412 --> 01:53:08.114
DONDE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES

01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:10.250
ACROSS NONPROFIT. AND WE ALIGNED

01:53:10.316 --> 01:53:12.085
WITH A COMMON GOAL AND WE ALIGN

01:53:12.152 --> 01:53:14.053
OUR RESOURCES WE CAN MOVE FASTER

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:18.358
THAN WE EVER THOUGHT WE COULD WE

01:53:18.424 --> 01:53:18.925
SURPRISED OURSELVES AND HOW

01:53:18.992 --> 01:53:19.526
QUICKLY WE ARE ABLE TO BRING

01:53:19.592 --> 01:53:20.093
PROJECT ROOM. ONLINE BUT IT

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:21.461
HAPPENED BECAUSE WE ALL LINED ON

01:53:21.528 --> 01:53:23.363
A VISION AND I THINK THAT WE CAN

01:53:23.429 --> 01:53:24.063
DO THAT AGAIN AND BUILD HAT

01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:26.399
MOMENTUM. AND LIKE YOU'VE HEARD

01:53:26.466 --> 01:53:27.667
IT PROJECT ROOM HE ALSO

01:53:27.734 --> 01:53:29.035
REINFORCE THE THINGS WE KNEW

01:53:29.102 --> 01:53:30.970
ABOUT SHELTER AND NEW WAYS THAT

01:53:31.037 --> 01:53:32.672
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT SHELTER.

01:53:32.739 --> 01:53:34.274
WHICH IS THIS NON CONGREGATE

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.643
DIGNIFIED SPACES THAT HAS A DOOR

01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:38.478
THAT LOCKS THAT HAVE A BATHROOM.

01:53:38.545 --> 01:53:40.813
AND LET'S PEOPLE COME INSIDE AND

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:41.714
HAVE A PRIVATE PLACE TO STAY

01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:43.917
WITH DIGNITY. AND THAT'S WHY

01:53:43.983 --> 01:53:45.084
PROJECT ROOM HE HAS REMAINED

01:53:45.151 --> 01:53:47.720
FULL- IT'S WHY PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:53:47.787 --> 01:53:49.022
BEEN HESITANT TO COME IN TO

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:50.523
SHELTER BEFORE WERE NOT HAS A

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:51.691
TEN AND WE HAD THOUSANDS OF

01:53:51.758 --> 01:53:53.359
PEOPLE WAITING TO GET IN THE

01:53:53.426 --> 01:53:55.028
PROJECT ROOM KEY. BUT SINCE THE

01:53:55.094 --> 01:53:56.629
BEGINNING A PROJECT ROOM KEY AND

01:53:56.696 --> 01:53:58.531
THE BEGINNING OF COALBED SO FAR

01:53:58.598 --> 01:54:00.033
WE'VE SERVE NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:54:00.099 --> 01:54:01.801
AND OUR PROJECT ROOM KEY SITES.

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:03.836
AND THE REAL SUCCESS TO ME IS

01:54:03.903 --> 01:54:05.104
NOT ONLY HOW MANY WE BROUGHT

01:54:05.171 --> 01:54:07.040
INSIDE. BUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:54:07.106 --> 01:54:08.942
COMING INSIDE ARE NOT RETURNING

01:54:09.008 --> 01:54:10.076
TO THE STREETS AT THE RATE WE

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:11.711
SEE IN OUR CONGREGATE SITES SO

01:54:11.778 --> 01:54:13.846
LESS THAN 10% OF PEOPLE ARE

01:54:13.913 --> 01:54:16.182
GOING BACK TO THE STREET. AND SO

01:54:16.249 --> 01:54:18.651
FAR SO FAR IT'S NOT OVER YET BUT

01:54:18.718 --> 01:54:20.420
25% OF PEOPLE HAVE GONE RIGHT

01:54:20.486 --> 01:54:21.654
FROM PROJECT ROOM KEY INTO

01:54:21.721 --> 01:54:22.822
PERMANENT HOUSING BECAUSE WERE

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:24.557
ABLE TO CENTRALIZE OUR HOUSING

01:54:24.624 --> 01:54:26.826
RESOURCES. RABAL TO CENTRALIZE

01:54:26.893 --> 01:54:28.962
OUR DOCUMENTATION SPECIALIST AND

01:54:29.028 --> 01:54:30.163
ALL OF OUR CASE MANAGEMENT ON

01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:35.535
SITE. TO GET PEOPLE INDOORS. IF

01:54:35.602 --> 01:54:37.370
SO I WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE THAT

01:54:37.437 --> 01:54:39.005
THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A QUESTION

01:54:39.072 --> 01:54:40.740
OF WHETHER SHELTER OR HOUSING

01:54:40.807 --> 01:54:43.209
WORKS BETTER IT'S NOT EITHER OR

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:44.911
SHELTER WORKS BEST WHEN WE HAVE

01:54:44.978 --> 01:54:46.412
HOUSING RESOURCES THAT WE CAN

01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:48.948
ATTACH TO IT WE NEED SHELTER TO

01:54:49.015 --> 01:54:50.617
GET FOLKS OFF THE STREET BUT

01:54:50.683 --> 01:54:52.051
WITHOUT THE PERMANENT HOUSING

01:54:52.118 --> 01:54:53.820
RESOURCES ON THE OTHER END

01:54:53.886 --> 01:54:55.421
PEOPLE WILL STAY IN SHELTER AND

01:54:55.488 --> 01:54:56.656
WE SEE LENGTH OF STAY IN SHELTER

01:54:56.723 --> 01:54:58.858
ACTUALLY INCREASING RIGHT NOW

01:54:58.925 --> 01:54:59.692
ONE TO TWO YEARS EVEN THE PEOPLE

01:54:59.759 --> 01:55:01.127
ARE STAYING WAITING FOR THAT

01:55:01.194 --> 01:55:02.795
HOUSING OPTION ON THE BACK AND-

01:55:02.862 --> 01:55:04.764
SO IT SHELTERS PREVENT PEOPLE

01:55:04.831 --> 01:55:07.133
FROM SUFFERING OUTDOORS. AND

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:08.601
HOUSING WILL MAKE THE SHELTER

01:55:08.668 --> 01:55:10.737
SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT SO IT'S

01:55:10.803 --> 01:55:13.740
ABOUT THE END- AND I'LL JUST END

01:55:13.806 --> 01:55:15.742
BY SAYING IT THAT WE TALK A LOT

01:55:15.808 --> 01:55:17.110
ABOUT PERMANENT HOUSING WE TALK

01:55:17.176 --> 01:55:18.177
ABOUT THE COST OF PERMANENT

01:55:18.244 --> 01:55:19.679
HOUSING. I THINK IT'S ALSO

01:55:19.746 --> 01:55:21.281
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BUILDING

01:55:21.347 --> 01:55:22.982
NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NOT

01:55:23.049 --> 01:55:24.384
THE ONLY PIECE THAT WERE LOOKING

01:55:24.450 --> 01:55:25.852
OUT WE'RE ALSO USING RENTAL

01:55:25.918 --> 01:55:27.587
SUBSIDIES THAT REPRESENT ABOUT A

01:55:27.654 --> 01:55:29.455
THIRD OF OUR HOUSING PLACEMENTS.

01:55:29.522 --> 01:55:31.391
WHERE WE HAVE CHALLENGES THERE

01:55:31.457 --> 01:55:33.092
IS MAKING THOSE RENTAL SUBSIDIES

01:55:33.159 --> 01:55:35.328
COMPETITIVE IN OUR MARKET- THAT

01:55:35.395 --> 01:55:36.629
YOU'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER THE

01:55:36.696 --> 01:55:38.431
COST OF LIVING IS ASTRONOMICAL.

01:55:38.498 --> 01:55:40.400
AND JUST FROM A WESTERN REGION

01:55:40.466 --> 01:55:41.834
PERSPECTIVE THIS ISN'T EVEN L.

01:55:41.901 --> 01:55:43.569
A. ALONE BUT ACROSS THE ENTIRE

01:55:43.636 --> 01:55:45.438
WESTERN SIDE OF THE U. S. THERE

01:55:45.505 --> 01:55:47.907
ARE THIRTY AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE

01:55:47.974 --> 01:55:50.643
HOUSING UNITS. FOR EVERY ONE

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:51.544
HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS THAT NEED

01:55:51.611 --> 01:55:54.280
THEM. SO IT'S LIKE A REALLY BAD

01:55:54.347 --> 01:55:55.848
GAME OF MUSIC MUSICAL CHAIRS

01:55:55.915 --> 01:55:57.317
ACROSS THE WEST COAST I WOULD

01:55:57.383 --> 01:55:59.552
SAY PROBABLY EVEN WORSE IN LA-

01:55:59.619 --> 01:56:01.287
THAT IS THE WEST COAST BUT A BAD

01:56:01.354 --> 01:56:02.889
GAME OF MUSICAL CHAIRS THAT

01:56:02.955 --> 01:56:04.123
LEAVES THE MOST VULNERABLE

01:56:04.190 --> 01:56:05.625
PEOPLE. OUT ON THE STREET

01:56:05.692 --> 01:56:08.328
WITHOUT AN OPTION TO RESOLVE

01:56:08.394 --> 01:56:10.129
THEIR HOMELESSNESS. SO WHAT WE

01:56:10.196 --> 01:56:11.831
NEED TO SEE FROM THE STATE IF

01:56:11.898 --> 01:56:13.700
THE CONTINUING OF BUILDING ON

01:56:13.766 --> 01:56:15.034
THESE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS LIKE

01:56:15.101 --> 01:56:16.669
YOU DID MAKING THE TWENTY TWENTY

01:56:16.736 --> 01:56:18.271
ONE BUDGET- AND WE'RE REALLY

01:56:18.338 --> 01:56:19.472
GRATEFUL FOR THE INVESTMENTS IN

01:56:19.539 --> 01:56:21.541
PROJECT HOME HE- AND THERE ARE

01:56:21.607 --> 01:56:23.443
HUGE LEAP FORWARD AND WE WANT TO

01:56:23.509 --> 01:56:25.211
BUILD ON THAT. THE BILLION

01:56:25.278 --> 01:56:26.813
DOLLAR STATE INVESTMENT AND

01:56:26.879 --> 01:56:28.981
HAPPY THIS YEAR- AND IN THE NEXT

01:56:29.048 --> 01:56:30.583
BUDGET YEAR IS REALLY CRITICAL

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:31.751
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

01:56:31.818 --> 01:56:33.619
RESOURCES TO MOVE PEOPLE OFF THE

01:56:33.686 --> 01:56:35.355
STREET WITH RENTAL SUBSIDIES IN

01:56:35.421 --> 01:56:37.757
CASE MANAGEMENT- BUT- AS YOU'VE

01:56:37.824 --> 01:56:40.259
HEARD CONSISTENCY IS. THE KEY AT

01:56:40.326 --> 01:56:42.261
WE REALLY NEED THE LEGISLATURE

01:56:42.328 --> 01:56:43.730
TO PRIORITIZE MAKING FUNDING

01:56:43.796 --> 01:56:45.064
PERMANENT SO WE CAN ENSURE

01:56:45.131 --> 01:56:46.499
SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE THE

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:48.401
PREDICTABILITY AND THE STABILITY

01:56:48.468 --> 01:56:49.869
OF RESOURCE THING THEY NEED TO

01:56:49.936 --> 01:56:51.938
SCALE UP. THEIR SERVICES AND

01:56:52.004 --> 01:56:54.407
KEEP THEM GOING. THE STATE BEGAN

01:56:54.474 --> 01:56:56.275
FUNDING FLEXIBLE FLEXIBLE

01:56:56.342 --> 01:56:58.211
FUNDING FOR LOCAL PROVIDERS IN

01:56:58.277 --> 01:56:59.645
THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:56:59.712 --> 01:57:00.980
BUDGET YEAR AND THAT. THE

01:57:01.047 --> 01:57:02.615
PROGRAM HAS CHANGED EVERY YEAR

01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:04.951
SINCE THEN. AND JUST I LIKE TO

01:57:05.017 --> 01:57:06.018
THINK ABOUT THIS IN ANOTHER

01:57:06.085 --> 01:57:07.887
CONTACT THAT WE WOULD NEVER

01:57:07.954 --> 01:57:09.856
EXPECT TO SET A SUCCESS FROM OUR

01:57:09.922 --> 01:57:11.190
SCHOOLS ARE K. THROUGH TWELVE

01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:12.825
SCHOOL SYSTEM. IF THEY HAD TO GO

01:57:12.892 --> 01:57:14.794
TO SACRAMENTO EVERY YEAR TO MAKE

01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:15.695
SURE THEY HAVE THE NEEDED

01:57:15.762 --> 01:57:16.496
FUNDING TO CONTINUE THEIR

01:57:16.562 --> 01:57:18.364
PROGRAMS. AND WE SHOULD TAKE THE

01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:19.699
SAME APPROACH AROUND HOMELESS

01:57:19.766 --> 01:57:23.903
SERVICES BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE

01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:24.470
THE RISK OF A CLIFF AT EVERY

01:57:24.537 --> 01:57:25.571
YEAR. AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU

WAS THAT THERE IS NO REAL

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:49.922
MAY BE PROVIDING A BILL THAT

01:58:49.989 --> 01:58:51.090
WOULD REINSTITUTE MENTAL

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:53.426
INSTITUTION. SO HOW WHAT'S YOUR

01:58:53.493 --> 01:58:55.161
THOUGHTS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING

01:58:55.228 --> 01:58:57.330
LIKE THAT BECAUSE AGAIN I'VE

01:58:57.396 --> 01:58:59.599
BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE PAST SIX

01:58:59.665 --> 01:59:00.566
YEARS SPEND I WOULD HOMELESS

01:59:00.633 --> 01:59:02.535
PEOPLE AND I SAID THAT BEFORE

01:59:02.602 --> 01:59:04.871
SUPERVISOR- YOU GOT HERE I SPEND

01:59:04.937 --> 01:59:05.738
THE NIGHT WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE

01:59:05.805 --> 01:59:08.374
EVERY YEAR I DIDN'T DO IT IN TWO

01:59:08.441 --> 01:59:09.008
THOUSAND TWENTY BECAUSE OF THIS

01:59:09.075 --> 01:59:10.910
PANDEMIC AND THEN I HAVE A GOD

01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:11.777
SON WHO'S HOMELESS ON CRYSTAL

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:14.814
METH. BUT MY- SPEND IT I WOULD

01:59:14.881 --> 01:59:16.782
HOMELESS PEOPLE HAVE UNCOVERED

01:59:16.849 --> 01:59:18.518
THAT ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW

01:59:18.584 --> 01:59:20.119
RIGHT FROM WRONG WHO CAN'T MAKE

01:59:20.186 --> 01:59:22.421
RATIONAL DECISIONS SO THEREFORE

01:59:22.488 --> 01:59:23.589
THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY ON THE

01:59:23.656 --> 01:59:26.259
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BECOME

01:59:26.325 --> 01:59:26.993
CONSERVATIVES OF THOSE

01:59:27.059 --> 01:59:29.161
INDIVIDUALS HOW MANY PEOPLE DO

01:59:29.228 --> 01:59:30.196
YOU THINK ABOUT NORM NUMBER

01:59:30.263 --> 01:59:31.464
QUESTIONS THERE HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:32.965
DO YOU THINK ARE HAVE MENTAL

01:59:33.032 --> 01:59:35.134
ILLNESS. BECAUSE WE CAN STILL

01:59:35.201 --> 01:59:36.969
TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE BUT WE

01:59:37.036 --> 01:59:45.211
CANNOT FORCE THEM INTO PERMANENT. OR TEMPORARY HOUSING IF THEY

01:59:45.278 --> 01:59:45.878
DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE THESE IN.

01:59:45.945 --> 01:59:47.613
ARE DOES I BASS A LOT OF THOUGH

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:51.317
TAKE A STAB AT IT- I JUST WANTED

01:59:51.384 --> 01:59:53.753
PUTPROVIDE ONE COMMENT TO THAT

01:59:53.819 --> 01:59:56.756
LAST PIECE AROUND MENTAL ILLNESS

01:59:56.822 --> 01:59:58.157
AND I CAN'T TAKE THIS OUT AND I

01:59:58.224 --> 01:59:59.425
MIGHT JUST JUMP IN AND ASK

01:59:59.492 --> 02:00:01.527
EVERYBODY TO JUST STORE OWNER

02:00:01.594 --> 02:00:02.695
COMMENTED IT'S MY FAULT OR

02:00:02.762 --> 02:00:04.430
LITTLE BIT BEHIND THERE SO. I

02:00:04.497 --> 02:00:05.464
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT SOMETIMES

02:00:05.531 --> 02:00:06.832
I THINK TH QUESTION AROUND

02:00:06.899 --> 02:00:08.601
MENTAL ILLNESS RESPONSES TO

02:00:08.668 --> 02:00:11.304
MENTAL ILLNESS GET OVERWHELMED

02:00:11.370 --> 02:00:11.871
BY THE QUESTION OF

02:00:11.938 --> 02:00:13.773
CONSERVATORSHIP BECAUSE EVEN IF

02:00:13.839 --> 02:00:14.707
WE CHANGE LAWS RUN

02:00:14.774 --> 02:00:16.509
CONSERVATORSHIP IT WOULD REALLY

02:00:16.576 --> 02:00:18.110
ONLY IMPACT A VERY SMALL

02:00:18.177 --> 02:00:19.679
PERCENTAGE OF OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:00:19.745 --> 02:00:21.547
EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS OKAY

02:00:21.614 --> 02:00:22.782
AND THAT'S THE REALITY OF WHAT

02:00:22.848 --> 02:00:24.717
WE'RE DOING WHAT WE NEED IS MORE

02:00:24.784 --> 02:00:26.385
RESOURCES TO SERVE THE MAJORITY

02:00:26.452 --> 02:00:28.220
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BOTH

02:00:28.287 --> 02:00:29.989
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND

02:00:30.056 --> 02:00:31.290
DEALING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.

02:00:31.357 --> 02:00:32.091
PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH

02:00:32.158 --> 02:00:32.825
MENTAL ILLNESS BEFORE THEY

02:00:32.892 --> 02:00:34.994
BECOME HOMELESS LIKE THAT'S

02:00:35.061 --> 02:00:36.562
WHERE WE NEED TO DOLLARS WE

02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:38.531
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO GET SO SICK

02:00:38.598 --> 02:00:39.198
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

02:00:39.265 --> 02:00:40.866
CONSERVATORSHIP AND WE HAVE THE

02:00:40.933 --> 02:00:42.702
ABILITY TO DO THAT AND THAT'S

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:43.970
WHERE I WANT TO FOCUS MY

02:00:44.036 --> 02:00:46.505
CONVERSATION AND I IN RESPONSE

02:00:46.572 --> 02:00:48.007
TO THAT TO THE TO YOUR QUESTION

02:00:48.074 --> 02:00:49.575
AROUND HOW DO WE DESIGN PROGRAMS

02:00:49.642 --> 02:00:51.143
THAT WORK- YOU KNOW I WANT TO

02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:52.645
LEARN FROM THE OFFICE OF

02:00:52.712 --> 02:00:54.647
DIVERSION AND REENTRY. THEY'VE

02:00:54.714 --> 02:00:56.182
DONE A LOT OF WORK IN CREATING

02:00:56.248 --> 02:00:57.850
COMMUNITY BASED CARE RESPONSES

02:00:57.917 --> 02:00:59.885
IN L. A. COUNTY WHAT HAVE THEY

02:00:59.952 --> 02:01:01.654
LEARNED LET'S TAKE THAT AND

02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:02.855
APPLY IT AT THE STATE LEVEL

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.991
EXPAND THAT INVESTMENT AND MAKE

02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:09.762
IT BETTER YOU KNOW. IF THANK YOU

02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:12.732
VERY MUCH- COUNCILMEMBER UP

MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS IS CAN BE

02:01:15.167 --> 02:01:18.304
A COSTLY ITEM FOR ANY COUNTY OR

02:01:18.371 --> 02:01:20.406
OR STATE AND WHAT I WOULD SAY TO

02:01:20.473 --> 02:01:22.041
YOU IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:25.244
STRINGS ATTACHED TO ACUITY SO

02:01:25.311 --> 02:01:27.213
YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY DEFELICE

02:01:27.279 --> 02:01:29.749
SICK MENTALLY SICK BEFORE WE CAN

02:01:29.815 --> 02:01:31.584
ACTUALLY PROVIDE YOU THE SPACE

02:01:31.651 --> 02:01:33.819
THE BED AND ALL OF THAT WE HAVE

02:01:33.886 --> 02:01:35.554
SO MANY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW THAT

02:01:35.621 --> 02:01:37.657
NEED THE PREVENTION AND WE NEED

02:01:37.723 --> 02:01:40.259
TO HAVE TWO PARALLELS ONE IS YES

02:01:40.326 --> 02:01:43.195
MORE STABILIZED. REFORM AND

02:01:43.262 --> 02:01:44.630
ASSISTANCE FOR MENTALLY HELD

02:01:44.697 --> 02:01:46.699
THAT ARE EXTREMELY ACUTE AND

02:01:46.766 --> 02:01:48.701
THEN YOU NEED THE OTHER MAYBE

02:01:48.768 --> 02:01:50.269
TWO OTHER STAGES ONE IS WHERE

02:01:50.336 --> 02:01:51.871
YOU CAN HELP DIED GIVE THEM A

02:01:51.937 --> 02:01:54.607
DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT BECAUSE

02:01:54.674 --> 02:01:56.108
MANY OF THE PEOPLE ON THE STREET

02:01:56.175 --> 02:01:57.843
AREN'T ALL MENTALLY ILL THEY

02:01:57.910 --> 02:02:00.479
FACE TRAUMA RAPE HARASSMENT

02:02:00.546 --> 02:02:02.181
DISCRIMINATION AND THEN A

02:02:02.248 --> 02:02:03.482
CARCERAL SYSTEM THAT HAS NOT

02:02:03.549 --> 02:02:05.785
BEEN GOOD FOR THEM AND SOMETIMES

02:02:05.851 --> 02:02:07.353
OUR OWN INSTITUTIONS MAKE PEOPLE

02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:09.155
POOR AND THEY END UP IN THE

02:02:09.221 --> 02:02:10.589
STREET IN THAT MANNER SO WE HAVE

02:02:10.656 --> 02:02:12.091
TO LOOK AT IT THROUGH DIFFERENT

02:02:12.158 --> 02:02:14.160
LENSES AND I DO BELIEVE IT WOULD

02:02:14.226 --> 02:02:15.461
BE WORTHWHILE FOR YOU ALL TO

02:02:15.528 --> 02:02:16.962
SPEAK WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF

02:02:17.029 --> 02:02:18.297
MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR DR JOHN

02:02:18.364 --> 02:02:21.534
SHARON. WHO HAS A LENGTHY OF

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:23.469
EXPERIENCE WORKING AT DIFFERENT

02:02:23.536 --> 02:02:25.404
LEVELS ON HOW WE ADDRESS THIS

02:02:25.471 --> 02:02:26.806
AND I WOULD SAY THAT WE DON'T

02:02:26.872 --> 02:02:28.140
HAVE ENOUGH REIMBURSEMENT FROM

02:02:28.207 --> 02:02:29.508
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW

02:02:29.575 --> 02:02:31.243
IF WE COULD SOMEHOW GET MEDICAID

02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:32.978
MEDICARE MONEY IN TO HELP

02:02:33.045 --> 02:02:34.613
REIMBURSE OUR TREATMENT FOR

02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:36.348
MENTAL HEALTH EVEN IF IT'S TEAMS

02:02:36.415 --> 02:02:37.917
GOING OUT ON THE STREET THAT

02:02:37.983 --> 02:02:39.719
WILL HELP REDUCE COSTS BUT WE'RE

02:02:39.785 --> 02:02:40.986
NOT DOING IT SO WE DO HAVE TO

02:02:41.053 --> 02:02:41.854
GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:02:41.921 --> 02:02:43.389
ENGAGED HERE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD

02:02:43.456 --> 02:02:45.858
SAY TO YOU. AND THEN OVERALL I

02:02:45.925 --> 02:02:47.660
THINK MAYBE HEIDI YOU CAN TALK

02:02:47.727 --> 02:02:49.195
ABOUT I WOULD JUST SAY THREE

02:02:49.261 --> 02:02:51.197
THINGS THAT COULD REALLY HELP

02:02:51.263 --> 02:02:53.199
MOVE THE NEEDLE ONE OUT HERE IN

02:02:53.265 --> 02:02:55.000
LA EVERY YEAR WE DO A GAP

02:02:55.067 --> 02:02:56.535
ANALYSIS THAT LOOKS AT WHAT IS

02:02:56.602 --> 02:02:58.170
THE POPULATION OF PEOPLE THAT

02:02:58.237 --> 02:02:59.405
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHAT

02:02:59.472 --> 02:03:01.040
ARE THEIR NEEDS AND WHAT ARE THE

02:03:01.107 --> 02:03:02.475
RESOURCES WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND

02:03:02.541 --> 02:03:04.343
WHAT'S THE DELTA BETWEEN WHAT WE

02:03:04.410 --> 02:03:05.778
HAVE AND WHAT WE NEED DOING OUT

02:03:05.845 --> 02:03:09.381
OF THE STATE LIGHT WIDE LEVEL IS

02:03:09.448 --> 02:03:10.116
SO NEEDED ACROSS THIS THEY TO

02:03:10.182 --> 02:03:11.117
TELL. WHAT'S THE FUNDING THAT

02:03:11.183 --> 02:03:12.284
WE'RE DOING WHAT IS OUR

02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:13.719
POPULATION LOOK LIKE AND LET'S

02:03:13.786 --> 02:03:15.654
IDENTIFY THE GAP BETWEEN. THAT

02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:17.223
WILL HELP US FIGURE OUT THE COST

02:03:17.289 --> 02:03:18.791
AND WHERE TO PUT THE COST. THE

02:03:18.858 --> 02:03:20.493
SECOND PIECE THAT I THINK OFTEN

02:03:20.559 --> 02:03:22.261
GETS LOST IN ALL THIS IS ALL OF

02:03:22.328 --> 02:03:23.796
THE MONEY IN THE WORLD WON'T

02:03:23.863 --> 02:03:25.364
RESOLVE THE ISSUE AND LESS WE

02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:26.365
LOOK AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:03:26.432 --> 02:03:27.900
BARRIERS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE

02:03:27.967 --> 02:03:29.535
AND HOW HARD WE MAKE IT FOR

02:03:29.602 --> 02:03:30.870
PEOPLE. TO GET INTO HOUSING

02:03:30.936 --> 02:03:32.805
ENOUGH NOT TO STATE IF SOCIAL

02:03:32.872 --> 02:03:35.040
SECURITY IT DO IT IF ACROSS THE

02:03:35.107 --> 02:03:38.144
BOARD. OKAY SO HOW DO WE BREAK

02:03:38.210 --> 02:03:39.845
THROUGH TAT RED TAPE WHILE WE

02:03:39.912 --> 02:03:41.680
INVEST IN THE RIGHT PROGRAM SO

02:03:41.747 --> 02:03:43.382
WE REALLY BUILD THE MOMENTUM.

02:03:43.449 --> 02:03:44.917
AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE IS

02:03:44.984 --> 02:03:46.185
CONTROLLING THE AFFORDABILITY IN

02:03:46.252 --> 02:03:48.053
THE ECONOMICS AT SCALE YOU KNOW

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:50.122
WE'RE IN THE US CAN YOU AFFORD A

02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:51.423
TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT ON MINIMUM

02:03:51.490 --> 02:03:53.125
WAGE. SO THAT THE FEDERAL

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:54.560
GOVERNMENT ISSUE THAT WE REALLY

02:03:54.627 --> 02:03:56.529
NEED TO BE PUSHING ON SO THAT

02:03:56.595 --> 02:03:57.630
WERE BRINGING THAT AFFORDABLE

02:03:57.696 --> 02:03:59.398
HOUSING ONLINE WHILE WE LOOK AT

02:03:59.465 --> 02:04:01.133
TACKLING THE EXISTING CRISIS.

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:03.068
AND REMOVING THOSE BARRIERS AND

02:04:03.135 --> 02:04:04.436
I'M GOING TO MOVE THE STUFF THE

02:04:04.503 --> 02:04:05.671
LONG BEFORE WE START LOSING TO

02:04:05.738 --> 02:04:07.406
SPEAKERS THAT WE SPENT. THE NEXT

02:04:07.473 --> 02:04:08.140
COUPLE HOURS ON THIS BECAUSE

02:04:08.207 --> 02:04:10.409
IT'S ROBUST LIKE. I THINK YOU

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:12.311
HAVE. BUT I WILL BE THE SECOND

02:04:12.378 --> 02:04:13.145
PERSON PRIVILEGES WHICH WHICH

02:04:13.212 --> 02:04:14.613
IS. ACTUALLY RIGHT IF WE HAD ALL

02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:16.148
THE MONEY IN THE WORLD WE STILL.

02:04:16.215 --> 02:04:17.483
AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING WE STILL

02:04:17.550 --> 02:04:18.951
WANT SALAS WITH TALK ABOUT FROM

02:04:19.018 --> 02:04:20.152
VICIOUS YOU WHAT WORKS AND WHAT

02:04:20.219 --> 02:04:22.454
WE DID CUT- PI DISAGREE WITH YOU

02:04:22.521 --> 02:04:23.455
THERE AT THE STATE LEVEL WE

02:04:23.522 --> 02:04:25.758
COULD DO SOMETHING STATEWIDE

02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:26.525
BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE SO BIG.

02:04:26.592 --> 02:04:28.327
THEY GET THE FOCUS REGIONALLY.

02:04:28.394 --> 02:04:31.263
ON ON ON SPOTS HERE. AND SOME OF

02:04:31.330 --> 02:04:32.565
IT IS LAND USE DECISIONS AT THE

02:04:32.631 --> 02:04:33.566
LOCAL LEVEL WHAT IS YOUR LOS

02:04:33.632 --> 02:04:34.767
ANGLES MAY MAYBE BETTER. IN

02:04:34.834 --> 02:04:36.235
TERMS OF BUILDING HOUSING IS

02:04:36.302 --> 02:04:38.437
STILL FAR FAR FAR BEYOND LACKS

02:04:38.504 --> 02:04:39.772
ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION

02:04:39.839 --> 02:04:40.973
BUT IT'S ABOUT MODERATE RATE IF

02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:42.775
I REMEMBER CORRECTLY AND ANSWER

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:43.943
YOU COULD CORRECT ME. BUT BUT I

02:04:44.009 --> 02:04:45.778
THINK IT'S SEVEN FIVE THOUSAND

02:04:45.845 --> 02:04:47.379
UNITS BUILT ABOVE MARKET RATE

02:04:47.446 --> 02:04:49.181
WELL IT'S ONLY DEVELOP WHEN IT

02:04:49.248 --> 02:04:50.382
WHEN IT HAS A DEFICIT OF THIRTY

02:04:50.449 --> 02:04:52.418
FIVE THOUSAND- UNITS BUILT ON

02:04:52.484 --> 02:04:54.253
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THAT FIGHT

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.788
IN THE LOW IN. A LOW INCOME SO

02:04:55.855 --> 02:04:57.156
THERE'S SOMETHING DETRIMENTALLY

02:04:57.223 --> 02:04:58.991
WRONG WITH THAT PIECE TO THAT

02:04:59.058 --> 02:05:00.159
BUT THE MORE DEVELOPING OUT OF

02:05:00.226 --> 02:05:00.893
THE MORE YOU'RE PUSHING PEOPLE

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:07.466
INTO THE STREETS- BUT PATHETIC

02:05:07.533 --> 02:05:08.934
BUT THAT EVEN. BUT EVEN. IS MUCH

02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:09.869
BETTER THAN. THAN THE READ IN

02:05:09.935 --> 02:05:10.636
TERMS HOUSING OR EVEN THIS. IN

02:05:10.703 --> 02:05:11.770
TERMS OF HOUSING YEAH. SO

02:05:11.837 --> 02:05:13.873
THERE'S A JOINT- RESPONSIBILITY

02:05:13.939 --> 02:05:15.841
BOTH AT THE STATE AND LOCAL. BUT

02:05:15.908 --> 02:05:16.942
THE STATE DOESN'T REALLY MAKE

02:05:17.009 --> 02:05:19.845
LAND USE DECISIONS. WE LEGISLATE

02:05:19.912 --> 02:05:22.214
ON BUT BUT- BUT WE DON'T HAVE

02:05:22.281 --> 02:05:23.349
THE AUTHORITY TO NECESSARILY DO

02:05:23.415 --> 02:05:24.917
THAT YOURSELF I THINK LOOK I I'D

02:05:24.984 --> 02:05:26.652
LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU- I'M

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:27.686
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:28.821
RIGHT BALANCE IS TO TRY TO FIX

02:05:28.888 --> 02:05:31.023
THAT. CAN BE ALMOST GO BACK THE

02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:33.926
ORIGINAL THING THAT I SET- WHICH

02:05:33.993 --> 02:05:35.027
IS ROLE. ROLE IN THIS TOGETHER

02:05:35.094 --> 02:05:36.161
WITHOUT A FIGURE OUT THE BEST

02:05:36.228 --> 02:05:36.662
WAY TO DO IT I REALLY

02:05:36.729 --> 02:05:38.564
APPRECIATE. AND I REALLY DO MEAN

02:05:38.631 --> 02:05:39.832
THAT THE VERY CANDID

02:05:39.899 --> 02:05:41.433
CONVERSATION BACK AND FORTH.

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:44.670

02:05:44.737 --> 02:05:45.938
THING ABOUT US IN THE COMMENTS

02:05:46.005 --> 02:05:47.673
SO I'M GONNA GO HERE AND THEN

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:48.274
I'M GONNA MOVE THE NEXT. OKAY

02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:50.843
WITH EVERYONE. I JUST GOT. JUST

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:52.845
BECAUSE I WANT TO SHARE A COUPLE

02:05:52.912 --> 02:05:53.979
I THINK A QUICK OPTION BUT IT IS

02:05:54.046 --> 02:05:56.515
OBVIOUS. IS THERE ANY. IS THERE

02:05:56.582 --> 02:05:57.716
THERE'S A LOT OF PALS ARE GOING

02:05:57.783 --> 02:05:58.984
AFTER THIS. DO YOU HAVE THE

02:05:59.051 --> 02:06:00.586
ABILITY TO LET US GO TO THE

02:06:00.653 --> 02:06:03.022

AHEAD BUT A COUPLE OF

02:06:14.733 --> 02:06:15.901
OBSERVATIONS I THINK ARE

02:06:15.968 --> 02:06:17.436
IMPORTANT FOR THE DISCUSSION

02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:19.705
FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY-

02:06:19.772 --> 02:06:21.140
SUPERVISOR YOU CAN ASK MISTER

02:06:21.206 --> 02:06:22.608

02:06:22.675 --> 02:06:24.076
OTHER DAY WE GIVEN. LAST NUMBER

02:06:24.143 --> 02:06:25.511
YEARS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR

02:06:25.577 --> 02:06:28.647
PETS IT'S BEEN A BIG PROGRAM FOR

02:06:28.714 --> 02:06:30.683
US IN THE STATE. SECOND ALL OF

02:06:30.749 --> 02:06:34.687
THE SNOW. AND WE CAN'T IGNORE

02:06:34.753 --> 02:06:36.322
THAT CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT IS

02:06:36.388 --> 02:06:39.158
EVERYTHING. PEOPLE WROTE CHECKS

02:06:39.224 --> 02:06:40.960
OF THE CITY AND THE COUNTY LEVEL

02:06:41.026 --> 02:06:42.594
BECAUSE THEY SOLVE PROBLEMS AND

02:06:42.661 --> 02:06:44.530
THEY WANT TO DO TO FIX IT WE ARE

02:06:44.596 --> 02:06:46.565
AT INFLECTION POINT FOR THE

02:06:46.632 --> 02:06:47.866
PRESIDENT LIKES TO TALK ABOUT.

02:06:47.933 --> 02:06:51.036
PEOPLE ARE SO ANGRY. IT'S THE

02:06:51.103 --> 02:06:54.306
RATIONAL ISSUE. SO ALL OF THESE

02:06:54.373 --> 02:06:56.308
EFFORTS ARE INTERESTING BUT I

02:06:56.375 --> 02:06:56.875
THINK YOUR POINT ABOUT

02:06:56.942 --> 02:06:58.143
ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS THE

02:06:58.210 --> 02:06:59.445
POINT THAT YOU MADE IT YOU BUILD

ARCHITECTURE OF OUR PUBLIC

02:07:17.229 --> 02:07:19.398
POLICY DEBATE I HAVE TO BE

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:21.200

BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE CASE MAYBE

02:07:38.650 --> 02:07:40.819
THOSE ARE TOOLS THAT WE COULD

02:07:40.886 --> 02:07:42.588
ENGAGE IN TO FURTHER FUND WHAT

02:07:42.654 --> 02:07:44.690

KNOW THAT I'M RUNNING A LITTLE

02:08:01.106 --> 02:08:02.474
BIT AND I'M AT FAULT BUT THIS IS

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:04.476
PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST

02:08:04.543 --> 02:08:05.110
CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD ON THIS

02:08:05.177 --> 02:08:07.546

COORDINATION AND BRINGING THINGS

02:08:13.952 --> 02:08:15.654
TOGETHER. AND I'VE SEEN IT WORK.

02:08:15.721 --> 02:08:17.589
I'VE SEEN IT WORK. BOB IN MY

02:08:17.656 --> 02:08:19.925
DISTRICT ARE USE- SUPERVISOR

02:08:19.992 --> 02:08:22.761
LISA MY STAFF. THAT THE S. J. S.

IN FACT. THE SUPERVISOR AND I

02:08:29.168 --> 02:08:30.135
PROBABLY NEVER HAVE TO GET ON A

02:08:30.202 --> 02:08:32.805
PHONE CALL. BECAUSE OUR STAFFS.

02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:34.606
HANDLE THE PROBLEMS IN THE

02:08:34.673 --> 02:08:37.843
DISTRICT. AND THEN. AND MAKE

02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:38.610
SURE THAT THINGS GET DONE. THIS

02:08:38.677 --> 02:08:42.381
SILO BEING THAT WE HAVE THAT YOU

02:08:42.448 --> 02:08:44.349
ALL DOING MARVELOUS THINGS IN

02:08:44.416 --> 02:08:46.151
YOUR PREFERRED RESPECTIVE SILOS

02:08:46.218 --> 02:08:48.187
THE SUGGESTION I WANNA GIVE IS-

02:08:48.253 --> 02:08:50.489
I'LL ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT ONE

02:08:50.556 --> 02:08:52.424
PERSON NEEDS TO BE IN CHARGE

02:08:52.491 --> 02:08:55.260
THERE IS NO ONE PERSON IN CHARGE

02:08:55.327 --> 02:08:57.162
NO DISRESPECT TO LHASA BECAUSE I

02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:58.664
REMEMBER WHY WE'RE FOR WRITTEN

02:08:58.730 --> 02:09:00.265
WHEN THEY STARTED LASSEN THAT

02:09:00.332 --> 02:09:01.400
WAS KIND OF THE IDEA AND WE

02:09:01.467 --> 02:09:03.402
NEVER REALLY EMPOWER LHASA TO DO

02:09:03.469 --> 02:09:06.472
THAT- AND SO WHETHER OR NOT. WE

02:09:06.538 --> 02:09:08.173
HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME

02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:09.007
WHETHER OR NOT I KIND OF

02:09:09.074 --> 02:09:10.309
DISAGREE WITH SOME OF MY

02:09:10.375 --> 02:09:11.877
COLLEAGUES THAT THE STATE MAY

02:09:11.944 --> 02:09:12.744
HAVE TO HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE

02:09:12.811 --> 02:09:14.213
SKIN IN THE GAME MAY WE HAVE A

02:09:14.279 --> 02:09:16.348
STATE HOMELESS CZAR THAT CAN

02:09:16.415 --> 02:09:18.550
PULL TOGETHER ALL THE RESOURCES

02:09:18.617 --> 02:09:20.686
IN THE INDIVIDUAL- COUNTIES AND

02:09:20.752 --> 02:09:23.155
CITIES TO MAKE SURE IT GETS DONE

02:09:23.222 --> 02:09:24.790
AND ADD ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES

02:09:24.857 --> 02:09:25.991
AND SO IF THAT IS SOMETHING

02:09:26.058 --> 02:09:26.959
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE ONLY

02:09:27.025 --> 02:09:29.328
CAVEAT I WOULD GIVE YOU IS THAT

02:09:29.394 --> 02:09:30.929
PERSON THAT WE PUT IN CHARGE

02:09:30.996 --> 02:09:32.531
MIGHT LOOK A LOT LIKE BOB

02:09:32.598 --> 02:09:36.101
HERTZBERG. SO BE CAREFUL WHAT

02:09:36.168 --> 02:09:38.237
YOU WISH FOR. IT ON THE WHEN YOU

02:09:38.303 --> 02:09:39.638

GROUPS YOU NEED. COULD ONLY

02:09:57.422 --> 02:09:59.691

WEINGART FOUNDATION. I ALSO

02:12:54.066 --> 02:12:56.234
SERVED- MOST OF MY CAREER IN THE

02:12:56.301 --> 02:12:57.703
PUBLIC SECTOR BOTH AT THE CITY

02:12:57.769 --> 02:12:59.538
OF LOS ANGELES AND THE COUNTY OF

02:12:59.604 --> 02:13:01.940
LOS ANGELES- I CHAIRED THE

02:13:02.007 --> 02:13:03.208
COMMITTEE FOR GREATER LOS

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:04.576
ANGELES WHICH WAS A COMMITTEE

02:13:04.643 --> 02:13:06.712
THAT WAS ESTABLISHED- DURING THE

02:13:06.778 --> 02:13:08.714
PANDEMIC. TO LOOK AT OUR

02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:11.583
SYSTEMIC ISSUES- IN A VARIETY OF

02:13:11.650 --> 02:13:14.886
ISSUES. AND PROPOSE. A SYSTEMIC

02:13:14.953 --> 02:13:17.055
SOLUTIONS TO ISSUES. THAT REALLY

02:13:17.122 --> 02:13:18.924
BUT WERE EXPOSED DURING THIS

02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:21.393
CRISIS. AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:23.261
GREATER ISSUE THAT MANIFESTS.

02:13:23.328 --> 02:13:27.733
THAT SYSTEMIC FAILURES OF ALL OF

02:13:27.799 --> 02:13:28.333
OUR SYSTEMS AND HOMELESSNESS.

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:29.868
THERE ARE THREE BASIC THINGS

02:13:29.935 --> 02:13:32.003
THAT I WANTED TO SHARE TODAY AND

02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:33.605
WIDELY IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE

02:13:33.672 --> 02:13:35.874
REPORT THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE AND-

02:13:35.941 --> 02:13:36.975
I THOUGHT GUY- THERE WERE SIGNS

02:13:37.042 --> 02:13:39.978
UP BUT I WANTED TO GIVE IT TO

02:13:40.045 --> 02:13:40.545
YOU SO YOU COULD. ANSWER I.

02:13:40.612 --> 02:13:42.914
ISAAC. WITH THE ASSISTANCE MIGHT

02:13:42.981 --> 02:13:51.089
THE CARDIO. I THINK A LITTLE.

02:13:51.156 --> 02:13:52.124
YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

02:13:52.190 --> 02:13:55.727
HEARING TODAY IS THAT THERE IS

02:13:55.794 --> 02:13:57.429
AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF

02:13:57.496 --> 02:14:01.032
INVESTMENT OF A PASSION OF

02:14:01.099 --> 02:14:03.402
COMMITMENT FROM EVERY ELECTED

02:14:03.468 --> 02:14:05.170
OFFICIAL EVERY DEPARTMENT

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:08.340
RESPONSIBLE AND EVEN FROM LOCAL

02:14:08.407 --> 02:14:10.675
RESIDENTS AND VOLUNTEERS. WE

02:14:10.742 --> 02:14:12.511
HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS AMOUNT OF

02:14:12.577 --> 02:14:15.580
ATTENTION AROUND THIS CRISIS.

02:14:15.647 --> 02:14:17.783
VOTERS HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF

02:14:17.849 --> 02:14:19.885
DOLLARS IN LOS ANGELES AND YET

02:14:19.951 --> 02:14:21.420
THE QUESTION I GET ASKED ALL THE

02:14:21.486 --> 02:14:23.955
TIME AS AS WELL AS YOU IS WHY IS

02:14:24.022 --> 02:14:25.323
IT THAT THE PROBLEM LOOKS TO BE

02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:29.127
GETTING WORSE. SO TO BE CLEAR

02:14:29.194 --> 02:14:30.929
THERE ARE NO VILLAINS HERE.

02:14:30.996 --> 02:14:32.264
THERE'S NOT SOMEONE WHO'S NOT

02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:34.499
EXERCISING LEADERSHIP IT'S NOT

02:14:34.566 --> 02:14:36.435
THAT WE'RE NOT INNOVATING IT'S

02:14:36.501 --> 02:14:38.437
NOT THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING HARD.

02:14:38.503 --> 02:14:40.105
IT'S THE FACT THAT ALL OF THESE

02:14:40.172 --> 02:14:42.641
EFFORTS AS AS AS THE CHAIRMAN

02:14:42.707 --> 02:14:44.943
POINTED OUT. ARE BEING DONE IN

02:14:45.010 --> 02:14:48.180
ISOLATION. WOULD YOU HEARD TODAY

02:14:48.246 --> 02:14:50.782
FROM- COUNCILWOMAN ROBIN ABOUT

02:14:50.849 --> 02:14:53.718
HOW SHE- IS PERSONALLY IN CHARGE

02:14:53.785 --> 02:14:54.986
OF FOR THE ENCAMPMENTS AND UNDER

02:14:55.053 --> 02:14:57.622
DISTRICT. NOW WHEN SHE SIGNED UP

02:14:57.689 --> 02:14:58.890
TO BE A COUNCILWOMAN I DON'T

02:14:58.957 --> 02:15:00.258
THINK I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S

02:15:00.325 --> 02:15:01.159
WHAT SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING

02:15:01.226 --> 02:15:03.228
TO BE DOING. THAT SHE GETS TO

02:15:03.295 --> 02:15:05.430
THAT SIDE WITCHING CAP MEN'S GET

02:15:05.497 --> 02:15:07.265
GET DEALT WITH HOW THEY GET

02:15:07.332 --> 02:15:09.367
DEALT WITH WHO SHE PARTNERS WITH

02:15:09.434 --> 02:15:11.336
WHO GETS PRIORITIZED INTO THE

02:15:11.403 --> 02:15:13.472
CAMP IT'S LITERALLY WHICH HUMAN

02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:16.074
BEINGS GET SELECTED. HER STAFF

02:15:16.141 --> 02:15:18.477
ARE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:15:18.543 --> 02:15:21.246
PROVIDING AND COORDINATING ALL

02:15:21.313 --> 02:15:23.081
OF THE SERVICES. AND SO WE HAVE

02:15:23.148 --> 02:15:25.617
A SYSTEM THAT IS BEING LED BY

02:15:25.684 --> 02:15:27.853
INDIVIDUALS WHO CARE A LOT. BUT

02:15:27.919 --> 02:15:29.888
IS NOT BEING LED BY A SYSTEM WHO

02:15:29.955 --> 02:15:31.690
THAT'S ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT'S IN

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:33.725
AND VERY IMPORTANT THING TO

02:15:33.792 --> 02:15:35.927
EMPHASIZE. IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE

02:15:35.994 --> 02:15:38.830
A WE HAVE A BROKEN SYSTEM IS THE

02:15:38.897 --> 02:15:40.765
FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM

02:15:40.832 --> 02:15:43.702
. WE HAVE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS THAT

02:15:43.768 --> 02:15:46.037
WORK IN THEIR OWN EFFORTS. WITH

02:15:46.104 --> 02:15:48.874
AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:50.575
ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE BETWEEN

02:15:50.642 --> 02:15:52.677
AGENCIES IT'S WHAT WE GET THINGS

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:55.514
DONE BUT IT'S NOT DONE ON IT

02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:57.782
INSTITUTIONAL BASIS. AND SO

02:15:57.849 --> 02:16:00.018
DESPITE ALL OF OUR BEST THINKING

02:16:00.085 --> 02:16:03.188
DESPITE THISIN ON PRESIDENT.

02:16:03.255 --> 02:16:04.956
WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO

02:16:05.023 --> 02:16:07.125
TURN THIS AROUND UNLESS THERE IS

02:16:07.192 --> 02:16:09.995
SOME COORDINATED ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:16:10.061 --> 02:16:12.831
NOT JUST TODAY BUT FOREVER.

02:16:12.898 --> 02:16:14.599
HOMELESSNESS IS NOT A TEMPORARY

02:16:14.666 --> 02:16:16.368
PROBLEM IT'S A FOR A FOREVER

02:16:16.434 --> 02:16:18.970
PROBLEM. AND THEN I THINK ABOUT

02:16:19.037 --> 02:16:20.405
THIS ISSUE HAVING WORKED ON IT

02:16:20.472 --> 02:16:23.742
FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER. THAT WE

02:16:23.808 --> 02:16:26.378
ARE HALFWAY THROUGH ULTIMATELY

02:16:26.444 --> 02:16:28.580
WHAT THE SOLUTION IS. TAKE A

02:16:28.647 --> 02:16:30.415
STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT WHAT

02:16:30.482 --> 02:16:31.950
IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE WHEN

02:16:32.017 --> 02:16:33.251
THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT EVERY

02:16:33.318 --> 02:16:34.986
PERSON SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO A

02:16:35.053 --> 02:16:36.922
PUBLIC EDUCATION. ARE THERE WAS

02:16:36.988 --> 02:16:39.090
AN IDEA AFTER HAVING A MASS

02:16:39.157 --> 02:16:41.459
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. IMAGINE

02:16:41.526 --> 02:16:44.029
IF THOSE EFFORTS WERE DONE IN

02:16:44.095 --> 02:16:44.663
SILOS IN THE WAY WE'RE DOING IT

02:16:44.729 --> 02:16:48.266
NOW. IT TOOK AN INITIATIVE OF

02:16:48.333 --> 02:16:50.302
THOSE VARIAS IDEA TO BRING

02:16:50.368 --> 02:16:52.404
TOGETHER NOT ONLY THE RESOURCES

02:16:52.470 --> 02:16:55.607
BUT THE COORDINATION THE ABILITY

02:16:55.674 --> 02:16:57.509
TO IMPLEMENT EVALUATE AND

02:16:57.576 --> 02:17:00.045
REENGAGE OVER AND OVER AND OVER

02:17:00.111 --> 02:17:03.214
AGAIN AS WE TRY TO PERFECT A

02:17:03.281 --> 02:17:05.951
SYSTEM. AND SO. AT THE CORE OF

02:17:06.017 --> 02:17:07.652
WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE IS

02:17:07.719 --> 02:17:09.421
PARTNERED WITH REYES

02:17:09.487 --> 02:17:10.956
SONNENSCHEIN WHO OF COURSE RUNS

02:17:11.022 --> 02:17:13.758
THE PAT BROWN INSTITUTE AND CAL

02:17:13.825 --> 02:17:16.494
STATE LA. TO LOOK SQUARELY AT

02:17:16.561 --> 02:17:18.597
THE ISSUE OF WHO'S IN CHARGE THE

02:17:18.663 --> 02:17:20.398
QUESTION THAT'S BEEN ASKED BY

02:17:20.465 --> 02:17:21.766
ALMOST EVERYONE OF YOU

02:17:21.833 --> 02:17:24.102
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. RAPE IS

02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:25.770
NOT A HOMELESS EXPERT AND WE

02:17:25.837 --> 02:17:27.839
SPECIFICALLY ASKED THEM TO LOOK

02:17:27.906 --> 02:17:28.306
AT THIS BECAUSE HE'S A

02:17:28.373 --> 02:17:30.375
GOVERNANCE EXPERT. HE'S

02:17:30.442 --> 02:17:32.611
ESTABLISHED THE ALLEY CHARTER HE

02:17:32.677 --> 02:17:35.146
WE HE HAS READ BOOKS ABOUT

02:17:35.213 --> 02:17:35.647
GOVERNANCE IN SOUTHERN

02:17:35.714 --> 02:17:38.049
CALIFORNIA. AND HE SPEAKS ABOUT

02:17:38.116 --> 02:17:40.986
IT ON A REGULAR BASIS THERE WILL

02:17:41.052 --> 02:17:41.920
COULDN'T BE A BETTER PERSON. AND

02:17:41.987 --> 02:17:44.789
WHAT HE PROPOSES AND I AGREE IS

02:17:44.856 --> 02:17:46.691
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A SYSTEM

02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:48.660
OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEMS. HE

02:17:48.727 --> 02:17:50.629
ACTUALLY PROPOSED THAT THERE NOT

02:17:50.695 --> 02:17:52.397
BE GOVERNMENT. AND THE REASON

02:17:52.464 --> 02:17:53.732
WHY HE PROPOSES AND NOT BE

02:17:53.798 --> 02:17:55.066
GOVERNMENT IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU

02:17:55.133 --> 02:17:57.569
TALK ABOUT CREATING ANOTHER

02:17:57.636 --> 02:17:59.738
GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY. IT'S

02:17:59.804 --> 02:18:02.641
ABOUT TAKING AWAY POWER AND AS

02:18:02.707 --> 02:18:05.443
EVERYONE KNOWS TAKEN AWAY POWER

02:18:05.510 --> 02:18:07.412
IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. WHAT

02:18:07.479 --> 02:18:09.180
NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS A COORDINATED

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:12.684
SYSTEM WHERE TOGETHER WE ARE

02:18:12.751 --> 02:18:14.319
IDENTIFYING WHAT ARE THE

02:18:14.386 --> 02:18:17.155
SYSTEMIC ISSUES AND WORK ON THEM

02:18:17.222 --> 02:18:19.991
ON A ON GOING BASIS. FOR EXAMPLE

02:18:20.058 --> 02:18:21.426
THE ISSUE OF HOUSING THAT WE

02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:22.994
HEARD TODAY FROM THE CONTROLLER

02:18:23.061 --> 02:18:24.796
AND FROM ANSEL WHO RUNS THE

02:18:24.863 --> 02:18:26.398
HOUSING DEPARTMENT. THE

02:18:26.464 --> 02:18:28.400
CONTROLLERS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

02:18:28.466 --> 02:18:30.201
THERE'S NOTHING THAT HE SAID

02:18:30.268 --> 02:18:31.670
THAT WAS INACCURATE ABOUT THE

02:18:31.736 --> 02:18:34.272
COST THE TIME THAT IT TAKES AND

02:18:34.339 --> 02:18:36.374
THE EFFORT TO BUILD PERMANENT

02:18:36.441 --> 02:18:38.743
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. BUT IT WAS

02:18:38.810 --> 02:18:40.745
DESIGNED THAT WAY IT'S IT WASN'T

02:18:40.812 --> 02:18:42.414
LIKE IT WAS A MISTAKE OR THERE'S

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:44.215
A GOTCHA IT WAS ACTUALLY

02:18:44.282 --> 02:18:46.651
DESIGNED AND IT'S WORKING

02:18:46.718 --> 02:18:48.653
EXACTLY AS IT WAS INTENDED.

02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:49.788
HOUSE PERMITTED SUPPORT OF

02:18:49.854 --> 02:18:52.290
HOUSING IS A COMPLICATED LAYER

02:18:52.357 --> 02:18:54.192
OF THE FUNDING STREAMS EACH WITH

02:18:54.259 --> 02:18:56.061
THEIR OWN PRIORITIES THEIR OWN

02:18:56.127 --> 02:18:57.228
THE TIME FRAMES THEIR OWN

02:18:57.295 --> 02:18:59.364
EXPECTATIONS. AND THE NONPROFIT

02:18:59.431 --> 02:19:01.499
DEVELOPERS ARE AT THE WHIM OF

02:19:01.566 --> 02:19:02.834
THOSE FUNDING STREAMS AND I HAVE

02:19:02.901 --> 02:19:04.769
TO WAIT AND ACCOMMODATE THEM

02:19:04.836 --> 02:19:07.338
BASED ON AN OBJECTIVE OF

02:19:07.405 --> 02:19:09.474
BUILDING HOUSING. PERMANENT

02:19:09.541 --> 02:19:11.710
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ISN'T PUT IN

02:19:11.776 --> 02:19:12.444
THE FRONT OF THE LINE ON

02:19:12.510 --> 02:19:14.612
DEVELOPMENT. AND SO THE TIME

02:19:14.679 --> 02:19:16.181
IT'S TAKING IT IS EXACTLY WHAT

02:19:16.247 --> 02:19:17.849
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE. THE

02:19:17.916 --> 02:19:19.117
QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT'S

02:19:19.184 --> 02:19:21.820
ACCEPTABLE AND I THINK ANGELENOS

02:19:21.886 --> 02:19:22.353
AND CLEARLY ALL OF YOU ARE

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:24.989
SAYING THAT IT'S NOT. SO IT'S

02:19:25.056 --> 02:19:26.357
NOT GOOD ENOUGH JUST TO

02:19:26.424 --> 02:19:29.194
CRITICIZE AND SAY WELL IT'S NOT

02:19:29.260 --> 02:19:31.563
WORKING THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE

02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:33.598
WE GOING TO FIX IT. AND THERE

02:19:33.665 --> 02:19:35.934
ISN'T A PLACE OUTSIDE MAYBE

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.435
TODAY THERE'S A CONVERSATION BUT

02:19:37.502 --> 02:19:39.437
THERE ISN'T A PLACE TODAY IT

02:19:39.504 --> 02:19:41.439
ANYWHERE LOS ANGELES WORK

02:19:41.506 --> 02:19:44.109
PEOPLE'S JOB IT IS TO FIGURE

02:19:44.175 --> 02:19:46.244
THAT QUESTION NOW. HOW DO YOU

02:19:46.311 --> 02:19:47.679
ACTUALLY BUILD AT THE SCALE THAT

02:19:47.746 --> 02:19:51.082
WE NEED. AT THE TIME FRAME THAT

02:19:51.149 --> 02:19:53.017
WE NEED AT THE MAGNITUDE THAT WE

02:19:53.084 --> 02:19:54.986
NEED THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED

02:19:55.053 --> 02:19:57.222
HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE NEED NO ONE

02:19:57.288 --> 02:19:57.789
COULD GIVE YOU THE ANSWER TO

02:19:57.856 --> 02:20:00.759
THAT. WHAT IS IT ACTUALLY GOING

02:20:00.825 --> 02:20:02.727
TO TAKE ANA OUTREACH LEVEL WHAT

02:20:02.794 --> 02:20:04.496
KIND OF BED SHOULD THEY BE. ALL

02:20:04.562 --> 02:20:07.999
OF THAT IS PART OF IT SO. SO FOR

02:20:08.066 --> 02:20:11.603
US. IT'S BEFORE WE THINK ABOUT

02:20:11.669 --> 02:20:14.239
YET ONE MORE FUNDING STREAM WHAT

02:20:14.305 --> 02:20:16.474
MORE PROGRAM OR INTERVENTION. I

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:18.777
THINK THE ROLE OF THE STATE. IS

02:20:18.843 --> 02:20:20.545
TO ASK THE QUESTION WHO'S

02:20:20.612 --> 02:20:22.347
ACCOUNTABLE ON A COORDINATED

02:20:22.413 --> 02:20:24.949
BASIS. AND I AGREE WITH THE LAST

02:20:25.016 --> 02:20:27.485
CONVERSATION THE STATE IS NOT AS

02:20:27.552 --> 02:20:31.489
AN OBSERVER. THE STATE HAS TO BE

02:20:31.556 --> 02:20:33.224

WHAT'S GOING ON. I DON'T WANT TO

02:21:27.946 --> 02:21:29.581
REPEAT ANYTHING THAT'S ALREADY

02:21:29.647 --> 02:21:30.915
BEEN DISCUSSED BECAUSE IT'S BEEN

02:21:30.982 --> 02:21:32.684
SUCH RICH MATERIAL ON THE

02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:35.854
PREVIOUS PANELS- WHAT I DO WANT

02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:38.389
TO DO IS. SUPPORT AND OFFER

02:21:38.456 --> 02:21:40.859
PERSPECTIVE AS THE ON THE GROUND

02:21:40.925 --> 02:21:42.894
DEVELOPER AND AS OF THE ON THE

02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:45.663
GROUND- OPERATOR. AND REALLY

02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:48.800
JUST BRING HOME THE POINT OF-

02:21:48.867 --> 02:21:50.268
SUPPORTING SOME OF THE THINGS

02:21:50.335 --> 02:21:51.703
THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BUT ALSO

02:21:51.769 --> 02:21:53.404
CALLING ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE

02:21:53.471 --> 02:21:55.173
ON GOING RESOURCES THAT THAT WE

02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:57.575
MIGHT NEED- VERY MUCH LOOKING

02:21:57.642 --> 02:21:58.710
FORWARD I THINK WE ALL ARE

02:21:58.776 --> 02:21:59.844
LOOKING FORWARD TO PROBABLY THE

02:21:59.911 --> 02:22:01.412
QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE BECAUSE-

02:22:01.479 --> 02:22:03.481
WE ARE THE- WE ARE THE BOOTS ON

02:22:03.548 --> 02:22:05.316
THE GROUND AND WE HAVE THE DIRT

02:22:05.383 --> 02:22:06.384
ON THE BOOTS. SO WE CAN

02:22:06.451 --> 02:22:07.919
ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW MAKE SURE

02:22:07.986 --> 02:22:09.854
THAT THAT WE SHARE INFORMATION

02:22:09.921 --> 02:22:11.923
WITH YOU- FROM THE SKID ROW

02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:13.658
HOUSING TRUST PERSPECTIVE ONE OF

02:22:13.725 --> 02:22:15.193
THE THINGS THAT I DEFINITELY

02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:17.428
WANT TO SAY IS YOU KNOW. WE DO

02:22:17.495 --> 02:22:19.631
HAVE ACTUAL PROJECTS THAT WERE

02:22:19.697 --> 02:22:21.499
IMPLEMENTED LAST YEAR AND THIS

02:22:21.566 --> 02:22:24.269
YEAR SO WE SUCCESSFULLY BUILT.

02:22:24.335 --> 02:22:26.271
THREE PROPERTIES AND ONE CLINIC

02:22:26.337 --> 02:22:28.907
IN SKID ROW. SO IT'S REAL IT'S

02:22:28.973 --> 02:22:31.309
TANGIBLE YOU KNOW IT'S TACTICAL

02:22:31.376 --> 02:22:32.410
YOU CAN SEE IT AND WE HAVE

02:22:32.477 --> 02:22:34.145
RESIDENTS LIVING THERE AND THERE

02:22:34.212 --> 02:22:35.313
ARE CLIENTS THAT ARE BEING

02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:37.248
SERVED BY THE JOSH WAREHOUSE- AT

02:22:37.315 --> 02:22:40.418
THE CLINIC THAT WAS PART OF OUR

02:22:40.485 --> 02:22:41.552
SIX FOUR NINE LAW. PROGRAM I DO

02:22:41.619 --> 02:22:43.221
WANT TO ECHO EVERYTHING THAT WAS

02:22:43.288 --> 02:22:45.089
SAID BEFORE YOU KNOW THAT WERE

02:22:45.156 --> 02:22:47.358
THE RECIPIENTS OF THE LACK OF

02:22:47.425 --> 02:22:49.961
THE COORDINATION. SO IF YOU SEE

02:22:50.028 --> 02:22:52.297
THE BUBBLES THAT MIGUEL SANTANA

02:22:52.363 --> 02:22:54.098
HAD AND YOU HEAR THE PREVIOUS.

02:22:54.165 --> 02:22:56.167
PANELS THAT SAID THERE'S SEVEN

02:22:56.234 --> 02:22:57.735
DIFFERENT OF ENTITIES IN THE

02:22:57.802 --> 02:22:59.971
STACK THERE'S FOURTEEN DIFFERENT

02:23:00.038 --> 02:23:02.373
GOVERNING AGENCIES WE ALL SIT

02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:04.142
AND HAVE TO ANSWER FOR ALL OF

02:23:04.208 --> 02:23:06.911
THEM. SO THERE'S TEN QUESTIONS

02:23:06.978 --> 02:23:08.746
TO TEN ENTITIES THERE'S ONE

02:23:08.813 --> 02:23:10.048
HUNDRED ITEMS THAT WE REPORT TO

02:23:10.114 --> 02:23:11.783
ONE A MONTH OVER MONTH BASIS.

02:23:11.849 --> 02:23:12.884
IT'S REALLY OVERWHELMING

02:23:12.951 --> 02:23:14.352
PARTICULARLY FROM A NONPROFIT

02:23:14.419 --> 02:23:16.654
PERSPECTIVE AND MANY OF US YOU

02:23:16.721 --> 02:23:18.556
KNOW- AND THE CROWD HAVE A

02:23:18.623 --> 02:23:19.590
BACKGROUND THAT KNOWS HOW TO

02:23:19.657 --> 02:23:21.426
MANAGE THAT. BUT ITS FINANCIAL

02:23:21.492 --> 02:23:22.727
MANAGEMENT ITS OPERATIONAL

02:23:22.794 --> 02:23:24.329
MANAGEMENT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

02:23:24.395 --> 02:23:26.397
IT'S HUMANISTIC MANAGEMENT AND I

02:23:26.464 --> 02:23:27.532
THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

02:23:27.598 --> 02:23:30.034
THAT WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON-

02:23:30.101 --> 02:23:32.103
THE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. I

02:23:32.170 --> 02:23:33.671
DO WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO

02:23:33.738 --> 02:23:35.139
THAT WAS THAT WAS MENTIONED

02:23:35.206 --> 02:23:37.408
EARLIER WAS THE COORDINATION OF

02:23:37.475 --> 02:23:39.644
THE SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO.

02:23:39.711 --> 02:23:41.579
THERE'S A UNIT PRODUCTION. THEIR

02:23:41.646 --> 02:23:43.681
SUBSIDY IN VOUCHER PRODUCTION

02:23:43.748 --> 02:23:45.216
THERE'S CASE MANAGEMENT

02:23:45.283 --> 02:23:47.051
PRODUCTION AND THERE'S MENTAL

02:23:47.118 --> 02:23:49.354
HEALTH SERVICES REQUIREMENTS AND

02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:50.588
SOMETIMES THAT MATH DOESN'T ADD

02:23:50.655 --> 02:23:53.391
UP. AND THAT WOULD BE. I THINK

02:23:53.458 --> 02:23:55.460
VERY MUCH APPRECIATED OU KNOW

02:23:55.526 --> 02:23:56.627
BY OUR ORGANIZATION

02:23:56.694 --> 02:23:58.296
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS THAT IF

02:23:58.363 --> 02:24:00.431
THERE IS A CENTRALIZED STRUCTURE

02:24:00.498 --> 02:24:02.500
OF A CORDON COORDINATED ATTEMPT

02:24:02.567 --> 02:24:04.469
AND GUIDANCE WE COULD ALL KIND

02:24:04.535 --> 02:24:06.170
OF RALLY TOGETHER. AND MAKE

02:24:06.237 --> 02:24:08.306
PROGRESS FASTER SO I DO THINK

02:24:08.373 --> 02:24:12.343
THAT- WE WANT TO ECHO THAT IN

02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:13.444
AND SHOW SUPPORT FOR THAT. ONE

02:24:13.511 --> 02:24:14.946
OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO

02:24:15.013 --> 02:24:16.414
CALL OUT IS THERE THERE IS AN

02:24:16.481 --> 02:24:18.383
INCREASE IN OPERATING COSTS

02:24:18.449 --> 02:24:19.717
OVERALL WHETHER IT'S PERMANENT

02:24:19.784 --> 02:24:21.619
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR SHELTER OR

02:24:21.686 --> 02:24:23.721
AFFORDABLE. WHEN YOU HAVE

02:24:23.788 --> 02:24:24.689
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:24:24.756 --> 02:24:25.857
LIVING ON THE STREET WHETHER

02:24:25.923 --> 02:24:27.759
IT'S TWO WEEKS OR TWO YEARS AND

02:24:27.825 --> 02:24:30.595
THEY HAVE- EXPERIENCE TRAUMA AND

02:24:30.661 --> 02:24:32.930
VERY YOU KNOW DESTITUTE AND IN

02:24:32.997 --> 02:24:34.999
HORRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY

02:24:35.066 --> 02:24:36.334
HAVE TO TRANSITION FROM LIVING

02:24:36.401 --> 02:24:37.969
ON THE STREETS TO LIVING IN A

02:24:38.036 --> 02:24:39.604
HOME AND THERE'S SOME CARE

02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:41.439
THAT'S REQUIRED FOR THAT THEIR

02:24:41.506 --> 02:24:42.907
SERVICES THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR

02:24:42.974 --> 02:24:45.543
THAT. SO IT WOULD BE GREAT TO

02:24:45.610 --> 02:24:47.211
FOCUS ON THOSE OPERATING COSTS

02:24:47.278 --> 02:24:48.446
BECAUSE THOSE OPERATING COSTS IF

02:24:48.513 --> 02:24:50.815
THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED ON A UNIT

02:24:50.882 --> 02:24:53.017
BY UNIT PERSON BY PERSON BASIS

02:24:53.084 --> 02:24:54.485
YOU WON'T SEE THESE BACK AN

02:24:54.552 --> 02:24:56.320
ASTRONOMICAL COSTS BECAUSE WE

02:24:56.387 --> 02:24:57.755
IGNORED PROBLEM AS IT WAS

02:24:57.822 --> 02:25:01.025
ESCALATING- SAFETY OVERALL.

02:25:01.092 --> 02:25:04.529
DON'T NEED TO POINT TO THAT BUT

02:25:04.595 --> 02:25:07.532
YOU KNOW THE SAFETY OF THOSE

02:25:07.598 --> 02:25:09.000
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE LIVING IN

02:25:09.067 --> 02:25:10.601
ENCAMPMENTS THING THEY NEED TO

02:25:10.668 --> 02:25:12.670
BE FOCUSED ON RESIDENTS IN THE

02:25:12.737 --> 02:25:14.639
UNITS THEIR SAFETY NEEDS TO BE

02:25:14.705 --> 02:25:17.208
FOCUSED ON THE EMPLOYEES THE

02:25:17.275 --> 02:25:18.843
LITERAL BOOTS ON THE GROUND THE

02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:20.044
CASE MANAGERS THE OUTREACH

02:25:20.111 --> 02:25:22.246
WORKERS THEY ARE WORKING UNDER

02:25:22.313 --> 02:25:24.048
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES TO

02:25:24.115 --> 02:25:24.782
WHEN THEY NEED TO BE

02:25:24.849 --> 02:25:26.384
INCENTIVIZED TO CONTINUE THAT

02:25:26.451 --> 02:25:27.718
WORK AND THEY NEED TO BE

02:25:27.785 --> 02:25:29.387
PROTECTED AS WELL SO THERE

02:25:29.454 --> 02:25:31.789
REALLY NEEDS TO BE A FOCUSED ON

02:25:31.856 --> 02:25:34.725
ON THAT. ALSO I DO I DON'T KNOW

02:25:34.792 --> 02:25:37.829
HOW WAS ARTICULATED EARLIER BUT

02:25:37.895 --> 02:25:39.063
- I'LL I'LL TRANSLATE IT THE WAY

02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:40.932
I INTERPRET IT IS YOU KNOW THE

02:25:40.998 --> 02:25:44.268
PUBLIC SUPPORT OR PERCEPTION OF

02:25:44.335 --> 02:25:46.170
SUPPORT OFTENTIMES AS A

02:25:46.237 --> 02:25:47.438
DEVELOPER AND THE OWNER AND THE

02:25:47.505 --> 02:25:49.740
OPERATOR MANY YOU KNOW VOTERS

02:25:49.807 --> 02:25:51.609
AND INDIVIDUALS AND RIGHTFULLY

02:25:51.676 --> 02:25:53.511
SO THEY COME TO US IN THERE SAY

02:25:53.578 --> 02:25:55.746
WHY ARE YOU DEVELOPING FASTER WE

02:25:55.813 --> 02:25:57.215
HAVE TO TAKE THAT FRONT LINE

02:25:57.281 --> 02:25:59.183
QUESTIONING. YOU KNOW IT'S VERY

02:25:59.250 --> 02:26:01.319
UNFORGIVING AT TIMES YOU KNOW

02:26:01.385 --> 02:26:02.553

HERE I SAID YEAH I REALLY DO. HE

02:33:44.214 --> 02:33:46.150
SAID. BECAUSE I THINK THE VOTERS

02:33:46.216 --> 02:33:49.186
ARE FED UP. HE SAID WE'VE PASSED

02:33:49.253 --> 02:33:50.988
THESE BOND MEASURES AND YET WE

02:33:51.055 --> 02:33:52.923
STILL SEE SO MANY CANNONS

02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:54.358
INCREASE OF PEOPLE ON THE

02:33:54.425 --> 02:33:56.927
STREETS HE SAYS I'M AFRAID FOR

02:33:56.994 --> 02:33:59.663
YOU. I SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN. IS

02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:00.230
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA NEED

02:34:00.297 --> 02:34:02.366
MORE MONEY. AND THE VOTERS ARE

02:34:02.433 --> 02:34:04.969
GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU. AND HE

02:34:05.035 --> 02:34:07.838
SAID WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

02:34:07.905 --> 02:34:10.541
GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS

02:34:10.608 --> 02:34:12.977
WHILE WE CONTINUE TO BUILD

02:34:13.043 --> 02:34:15.112
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

02:34:15.179 --> 02:34:16.480
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT I

02:34:16.547 --> 02:34:19.049
FIRMLY BELIEVE IN. WE KNOW THAT

02:34:19.116 --> 02:34:20.985
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE AND

02:34:21.051 --> 02:34:23.454
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS WHERE

02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:25.456
WE'RE GOING WHERE IT HAS TO END

02:34:25.522 --> 02:34:27.391
WE HAVE TO GET PEOPLE THERE BUT

02:34:27.458 --> 02:34:29.226
IN THE MEANTIME IN THE MEANTIME

02:34:29.293 --> 02:34:30.594
THE STREETS CANNOT BE THE

02:34:30.661 --> 02:34:32.763
WAITING ROOM FOR PERMANENT

02:34:32.830 --> 02:34:34.732
HOUSING AS IS VINCE ALREADY SAID

02:34:34.798 --> 02:34:35.833
MUCH MORE ELOQUENT THAN I COULD

02:34:35.899 --> 02:34:39.570
SAY IT'S YES AND- WE NEED BOTH.

02:34:39.637 --> 02:34:41.739
AND THE ABILITY TO BRING PEOPLE

02:34:41.805 --> 02:34:44.441
INSIDE QUICKLY. I OFTEN THINK

02:34:44.508 --> 02:34:46.443
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN GOD FORBID IF

02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:48.312
THERE WAS AN EARTHQUAKE TONIGHT

02:34:48.379 --> 02:34:49.246
. AND WE WOKE UP THE NEXT

02:34:49.313 --> 02:34:50.714
MORNING IN ALL THESE BUILDINGS

02:34:50.781 --> 02:34:54.051
WERE RED TAGGED IN AND WE HAD

02:34:54.118 --> 02:34:55.452
SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WERE

02:34:55.519 --> 02:34:57.655
HOMELESS IN OUR GREAT CITY. THE

02:34:57.721 --> 02:34:58.956
NATIONAL GUARD WOULD BE HERE IN

02:34:59.023 --> 02:35:01.025
MINUTES THE RED CROSS TO BE

02:35:03.193 --> 02:35:04.495
THAT OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS

HOW MANY YEARS HAVE WE SAID

WHILE THIS IS A REAL CRISIS

02:35:12.903 --> 02:35:14.972
WE'RE FACING. HOMELESSNESS WHILE

02:35:15.039 --> 02:35:18.242
IT'S TERRIBLE AND YET WE HAVE

02:35:18.308 --> 02:35:22.479
NOT HAD A FEMA LIKE RESPONSE. IN

02:35:22.546 --> 02:35:23.247
TWENTY TWENTY WE HAD THE

02:35:23.313 --> 02:35:24.882
PRIVILEGE OF OPENING TO LARGE

02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:34.625
PRIVILEGE IN THIS IS ALL WORKING

02:35:34.692 --> 02:35:36.093
WITH LASSA WORKING WITH LOCAL

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:37.094

02:35:40.197 --> 02:35:42.599
WE WERE ABLE TO OPEN UP. SIX

02:35:42.666 --> 02:35:45.002
TINY HOME COMMUNITIES. THE VERY

02:35:45.069 --> 02:35:46.203
FIRST TINY HOME COMMUNITY LOS

02:35:46.270 --> 02:35:47.304
ANGELES WAS ON CHANDLER

02:35:47.371 --> 02:35:49.339
BOULEVARD IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD. IN

02:35:49.406 --> 02:35:50.874
THE LAST ONE WHICH IS OPENED

02:35:50.941 --> 02:35:52.643
HERE IN COUNCIL DISTRICT

02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:53.911
FOURTEEN COUNCILMAN KIM DAILY ON

02:35:53.977 --> 02:35:55.312
AND I KNOW WE HAD THE PRIVILEGE

02:35:55.379 --> 02:35:56.580
OF A NUMBER OF US ACTUALLY

02:35:56.647 --> 02:35:58.982
SPENDING THE NIGHT IN THOSE TINY

02:35:59.049 --> 02:36:03.287
HOMES WHAT IS IT LIKE. AND IT

02:36:03.353 --> 02:36:04.688
THE INITIAL COSTS WERE QUITE

02:36:04.755 --> 02:36:06.957
HIGH BECAUSE THE FIRST PROJECT

02:36:07.024 --> 02:36:08.292
WAS ACTUALLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF

02:36:08.358 --> 02:36:10.394
RAW DIRT WHERE THERE IS NO SEWER

02:36:10.461 --> 02:36:12.196
LINES NO WATER LINES NO GAS

02:36:12.262 --> 02:36:14.298
LINES AND THEY POURED CONCRETE

02:36:14.364 --> 02:36:16.133
PADS AND IT WAS QUITE EXPENSIVE

02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:19.002
BUT I'M PROUD TO SAY THE LAST

02:36:19.069 --> 02:36:20.104
ONE THAT WAS JUST OPEN AND

02:36:20.170 --> 02:36:22.272
COUNCILS TO FOURTEEN THE AVERAGE

02:36:22.339 --> 02:36:25.042
COST PER UNIT WAS AROUND FORTY

02:36:25.109 --> 02:36:27.544
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THOSE

02:36:27.611 --> 02:36:29.613
TINY HOME UNITS AND I'M I'M NOT

02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:31.482
HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR PALLET

02:36:31.548 --> 02:36:33.350
SHELTER OR ANY OTHER TIME YOU I

02:36:33.417 --> 02:36:35.152
DON'T CARE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.

02:36:35.219 --> 02:36:36.587
WHAT I DO CARE ABOUT IS WE GET

02:36:36.653 --> 02:36:38.021
PEOPLE INDOORS BECAUSE THE

02:36:38.088 --> 02:36:39.857
LONGER PEOPLE STAY OUTSIDE THE

02:36:39.923 --> 02:36:41.925
MORE THEY DETERIORATE MENTALLY

02:36:41.992 --> 02:36:44.394
PHYSICALLY EMOTIONALLY AND SO

02:36:44.461 --> 02:36:45.195
WE'VE GOT TO BRING PEOPLE

02:36:45.262 --> 02:36:47.865
INSIDE. I MEAN TELLING PEOPLE TO

02:36:47.931 --> 02:36:48.966
STAY ON THE STREETS TO WE CAN

02:36:49.032 --> 02:36:50.033
BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING MAKES

02:36:50.100 --> 02:36:51.835
AS MUCH SENSE AS ME HAVING

02:36:51.902 --> 02:36:54.171
HYPOTHERMIA AND SAYING CAN WAIT

02:36:54.238 --> 02:36:55.239
IN THE SNOW INTO THE DOCTOR CAN

02:36:55.305 --> 02:36:57.975
SEE YOU. WE WOULDN'T DO THAT.

02:36:58.041 --> 02:37:00.177
AND SO WE HAVE TO BE HUMANE WE

02:37:00.244 --> 02:37:02.379
HAVE TO ACT WITH A SENSE OF

02:37:02.446 --> 02:37:04.414
URGENCY. AND SO. ONE OF THE

02:37:04.481 --> 02:37:06.116
THINGS I'VE REALIZED AND AS A

02:37:06.183 --> 02:37:07.785
SERVICE PROVIDER WE'RE VERY

02:37:07.851 --> 02:37:10.053
LIMITED IN WHAT WE CAN AND CAN'T

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:12.389
DO. BUT GOVERNMENT YOU'VE GOT A

02:37:12.456 --> 02:37:14.358
LOT OF LEVERS YOU CAN PULL. I

02:37:14.424 --> 02:37:15.793
MEAN THERE'S WAYS TO INCREASE

02:37:15.859 --> 02:37:17.027
REVENUE THERE'S WAYS TO CUT

02:37:17.094 --> 02:37:18.629
EXPENSES THERE'S WAYS TO MAKE

02:37:18.695 --> 02:37:20.597
THINGS HAPPEN AND SO I GOTTA

02:37:20.664 --> 02:37:24.301
TELL YA. I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC WHY

02:37:24.368 --> 02:37:25.869

02:37:25.936 --> 02:37:27.871

AT LEAST OR WANT TO SAY THAT BUT

I ALSO KNOW HE WAS A VERY

02:37:52.129 --> 02:37:54.164
AGGRESSIVE IN MAKING SURE

BOTH THE CITY AND THE COUNTY

02:42:23.533 --> 02:42:26.436
YOU'RE HEARD THAT TODAY THAT

02:42:26.503 --> 02:42:29.406
THERE IS NO PLACE WHERE THE CITY

02:42:29.473 --> 02:42:30.941
AND THE COUNTY LET ALONE THE

02:42:31.007 --> 02:42:32.943
OTHER EIGHTY SEVEN CITIES ARE

02:42:33.009 --> 02:42:35.579
TRYING TO SORT OUT NOT ONLY BE

02:42:35.645 --> 02:42:37.447
IMMEDIATE ISSUES LIKE THE ONE

02:42:37.514 --> 02:42:38.949
YOU REYES OF PERMANENT

02:42:39.015 --> 02:42:41.251
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND-

02:42:41.318 --> 02:42:43.753
IMMEDIATE SHELTER. BUT REALLY

02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:45.555
PLAN OUT FOR THE FUTURE AS TO

02:42:45.622 --> 02:42:46.790
WHERE WE'RE GOING AND SO I'LL

02:42:46.857 --> 02:42:49.359
GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF L. A. METRO

02:42:49.426 --> 02:42:53.029
RIGHT. LA METRO IS A REGIONAL-

02:42:53.096 --> 02:42:56.533
GOVERNING SYSTEM THAT OVERSEES

02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:59.402
NOT TEST THE EXISTING BRICKS AND

02:42:59.469 --> 02:43:03.640
MORTAR OF A SYSTEM THAT IS RAIL.

02:43:03.707 --> 02:43:05.909
AND A BUS SYSTEM BUT IS

02:43:05.976 --> 02:43:07.978
RESPONSIBLE FOR THINKING ABOUT

02:43:08.044 --> 02:43:11.281
THE FUTURE. AND WHILE IN PERFECT

02:43:11.348 --> 02:43:12.949
AND CERTAINLY HAS ITS SHARE OF

02:43:13.016 --> 02:43:15.852
CHALLENGES. A COUPLE TIMES A

02:43:15.919 --> 02:43:17.954
MONTH EACH MEMBER OF THE BOARD

02:43:18.021 --> 02:43:20.690
OF SUPERVISORS THE MAYOR AND HIS

02:43:20.757 --> 02:43:22.626
DESIGNATE AND REPRESENTATIVES OF

02:43:22.692 --> 02:43:25.028
THE REGION OF THE COUNTY SHOW UP

02:43:25.095 --> 02:43:27.764
AT A MEETING LIKE THIS AND HAVE

02:43:27.831 --> 02:43:30.300
TO SORT OUT THE COMPLICATED

02:43:30.367 --> 02:43:32.235
ISSUES OF WRITING IN THE SYSTEM

02:43:32.302 --> 02:43:34.037
. THE POWER OF THAT IS THAT THEY

02:43:34.104 --> 02:43:35.372
HAVE CONVINCED NOT ONLY

02:43:35.438 --> 02:43:38.074
ANGELENOS COUNTY WIDE TO TAX

02:43:38.141 --> 02:43:40.110
THEMSELVES FOR A FUTURE SYSTEM.

02:43:40.177 --> 02:43:41.878
BUT HAVE BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE

02:43:41.945 --> 02:43:43.914
AND EFFECTIVE IN CONVINCING YOU

02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:44.814
THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL

02:43:44.881 --> 02:43:48.718
GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT A REGIONAL

02:43:48.785 --> 02:43:49.286
SYSTEM BASED ON A LONG TERM

02:43:49.352 --> 02:43:52.489
VISION. AS WELL AS TRYING TO

02:43:52.556 --> 02:43:58.094
SORT OUT THE REAL CHALLENGES OF.

02:43:58.161 --> 02:43:59.663
HOW DO YOU INCREASE RIDERSHIP

02:43:59.729 --> 02:44:00.830
HOW DO YOU HAVE DIFFERENT BILL

02:44:00.897 --> 02:44:04.000
LADD MODALITIES OF SYSTEM SO THE

02:44:04.067 --> 02:44:06.770
MERE FACT THAT THERE IS A PLACE.

02:44:06.836 --> 02:44:08.471
THAT FRANKLY WAS CREATED BY THE

02:44:08.538 --> 02:44:11.908
STATE IT WASN'T IT DIDN'T IT

02:44:11.975 --> 02:44:14.010
WASN'T IT DIDN'T COME FROM US.

02:44:14.077 --> 02:44:16.146
THAT THE ISSUE OF TRANSPORTATION

02:44:16.213 --> 02:44:17.747
IS LOOKED OUT REGIONALLY WHEN

02:44:17.814 --> 02:44:18.949
YOU SHOW UP TO THAT MEETING

02:44:19.015 --> 02:44:20.083
YOU'RE NOT JUST REPRESENTING THE

02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:22.652
CITY OF LOS ANGELES IF YOU'RE

02:44:22.719 --> 02:44:23.253
THE MAYOR YOU'RE REPRESENTING

02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:25.488
THE REGION. GIVES THE

02:44:25.555 --> 02:44:27.457
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON THAT

02:44:27.524 --> 02:44:29.559
ISSUE ON A ON GOING BASIS. AND

02:44:29.626 --> 02:44:33.997
SO THE WHAT WE SUGGEST IS THAT

02:44:34.064 --> 02:44:35.265
THERE NEEDS TO BE A PLACE LIKE

02:44:35.332 --> 02:44:38.268
THAT. WHETHER IT'S A FORMAL J.

02:44:38.335 --> 02:44:39.803
P. A. IN A FORTY THAT HAS

02:44:39.869 --> 02:44:41.738
BINDING AUTHORITY AND ABILITY TO

02:44:41.805 --> 02:44:44.507
TAX ALL OF US. THAT BUILDS AS

02:44:44.574 --> 02:44:47.611
WELL AS MANAGES OR IT'S SIMPLY A

02:44:47.677 --> 02:44:49.879
PLACE OF CORD NATION. LHASA IT

02:44:49.946 --> 02:44:52.616
IS SUBJECT IS THE IS THE VICTIM

02:44:52.682 --> 02:44:54.517
OF THE LACK OF COORDINATION IT'S

02:44:54.584 --> 02:44:56.219
NOT BECAUSE EVERYONE ASSUMES

02:44:56.286 --> 02:44:57.687
THERE THE IN CHARGE BUT THEY'RE

02:44:57.754 --> 02:44:58.788
NOT THEY'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO

02:44:58.855 --> 02:45:01.524
TELL YOU THEY'RE NOT. AND SO.

02:45:01.591 --> 02:45:02.993
THAT'S WHAT IF THAT'S WHERE

02:45:03.059 --> 02:45:04.427
WE'RE REALLY COMING AT THIS

02:45:04.494 --> 02:45:07.297
PROBLEM IS UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:45:07.364 --> 02:45:07.998
ALL OF THESE EFFORTS ARE

02:45:08.064 --> 02:45:09.566
HAPPENING. AND THERE'S

02:45:09.633 --> 02:45:11.334
COORDINATION THAT HAPPENS ON A

02:45:11.401 --> 02:45:13.637
VERY EPISODIC BASIS EVERY SINGLE

02:45:13.703 --> 02:45:15.538
DAY WITH A LOT OF CARING PEOPLE

02:45:15.605 --> 02:45:17.073
A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS WORKING

02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:19.075
VERY HARD. BUT IT'S NOT

02:45:19.142 --> 02:45:26.049
HAPPENING ON A SYSTEMIC BASIS.

02:45:26.116 --> 02:45:27.784
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M

02:45:27.851 --> 02:45:31.821
GONNA. HI IF I COULD JUST ASK A

02:45:31.888 --> 02:45:34.391
MISTER SANTANA- FOLLOW UP

02:45:34.457 --> 02:45:37.394
QUESTION- I READ THAT REPORT

02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:39.496
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WITH- WITH

02:45:39.562 --> 02:45:40.363
GREAT INTEREST AND YOU KNOW

02:45:40.430 --> 02:45:47.203
SOME- FANTASTIC IDEAS- BUT- WHAT

02:45:47.270 --> 02:45:49.939
POWER IS ACTUALLY INTENDED TO BE

02:45:50.006 --> 02:45:53.410
CONFERRED UPON THIS BODY- YOU

02:45:53.476 --> 02:45:55.612
STARTED YOUR REMARKS I RECALL BY

02:45:55.679 --> 02:45:58.281
SAYING TAKING POWER IS EXTREMELY

02:45:58.348 --> 02:46:01.851
DIFFICULT AND- PROBABLY- A

02:46:01.918 --> 02:46:03.353
NONSTARTER SELF HOW DO WE

02:46:03.420 --> 02:46:06.089
CONFIRM POWER. OF COORDINATION

02:46:06.156 --> 02:46:08.925
OF DECISION MAKING- METRO IS A

02:46:08.992 --> 02:46:11.127
GOOD EXAMPLE BUT METRO HAS A LOT

02:46:11.194 --> 02:46:14.898
OF POWER- TO COORDINATE AND TO

02:46:14.964 --> 02:46:19.002
SPEND MONEY. SO WE I STARTED OFF

02:46:19.069 --> 02:46:21.838
WHEN WE DID THIS WORK WITH A

02:46:21.905 --> 02:46:24.441
VERY BY A CLEAR BIAS THAT UNLESS

02:46:24.507 --> 02:46:27.677
IT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO. CONTROL

02:46:27.744 --> 02:46:32.849
LAND BUILD MANAGE TAX BOND THEN

02:46:32.916 --> 02:46:34.951
IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME. BUT

02:46:35.018 --> 02:46:36.586
THIS IS WHERE HIGHER HIRING AN

02:46:36.653 --> 02:46:38.221
OUTSIDE EXPERT ON GOVERNANCE

02:46:38.288 --> 02:46:40.290
ACTUALLY IS HELPFUL AND RAY

02:46:40.357 --> 02:46:41.791
FIFTY KNOW HIM IS VERY

02:46:41.858 --> 02:46:43.093
INDEPENDENT THINKING HE

02:46:43.159 --> 02:46:44.928
UNDERSTANDS L. A. FROM A

02:46:44.994 --> 02:46:46.363
GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE BETTER

02:46:46.429 --> 02:46:48.365
THAN ANYONE. AND HE BASICALLY

02:46:48.431 --> 02:46:51.034
ARGUED THAT IF YOU START THERE

02:46:51.101 --> 02:46:52.769
BY TAKING AWAY POWER FROM

02:46:52.836 --> 02:46:55.071
EVERYONE ELSE THAT YOU'RE NEVER

02:46:55.138 --> 02:46:56.973
GOING TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS. WHAT

02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:58.775
NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS THERE HAS TO

02:46:58.842 --> 02:47:00.610
BE A SEPARATE ENTITY WHOSE JOB

02:47:00.677 --> 02:47:02.712
IT IS TO ANSWER THESE BIG

02:47:02.779 --> 02:47:06.015
QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT IS OUR TEN

02:47:06.082 --> 02:47:08.752
YEAR PROJECTION. WHAT ROLES TO

02:47:08.818 --> 02:47:11.421
EACH JURISDICTION HAVE WHAT WHAT

02:47:11.488 --> 02:47:12.789
IS THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED

02:47:12.856 --> 02:47:14.457
EARLIER WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE

02:47:14.524 --> 02:47:15.892
FOLKS WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM

02:47:15.959 --> 02:47:17.594
HOMELESSNESS ARE ALSO SUFFERING

02:47:17.660 --> 02:47:18.928
FROM ADDICTION AND THE MENTAL

02:47:18.995 --> 02:47:20.397
ILLNESS THERE ISN'T AN ANSWER

02:47:20.463 --> 02:47:23.233
FOR YOU TODAY. WHAT IS IT GONNA

02:47:23.299 --> 02:47:25.568
TAKE. AND REALLY BUILDING A

02:47:33.309 --> 02:47:35.445

HAS THE POWER TO ACTUALLY

02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:40.283
IMPLEMENT. BUT IF WE START OFF

02:47:40.350 --> 02:47:42.252
WITH THAT PREMISE THAT IN ORDER

02:47:42.318 --> 02:47:43.787
TO MAKE THIS WORK PEOPLE HAVE TO

02:47:43.853 --> 02:47:46.022
GIVE UP POWER. IT'S GONNA DIE

02:47:48.258 --> 02:47:50.493

THE CRISIS AND WE BELIEVE THAT

IT AS A WHOLE IS NOT BUILDING

02:50:47.637 --> 02:50:49.505
ENOUGH UNITS. THE CITY HAS

02:50:49.572 --> 02:50:51.374

LEADERSHIP. ON THIS ISSUE. AND

02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:52.875

EXPERIENCE AND. I AM I RESERVE

03:03:15.050 --> 03:03:17.353
SOLUTION WAS TO RIDE BUSES. WITH

03:03:17.419 --> 03:03:19.321
RIDE BUSES ALL NIGHT AND MAYBE

03:03:19.388 --> 03:03:21.290

TO THE OCCASIONAL OVERNIGHT

03:03:23.192 --> 03:03:30.332
LAUNDROMAT. AND. THOSE THAT IN

03:03:30.399 --> 03:03:32.968
THE BILL LINKAGE REALLY BETWEEN

03:03:33.035 --> 03:03:34.436
THE EXPERIENCE OF THE MYSTIC

03:03:34.503 --> 03:03:36.972
VIOLENCE AND HOMELESSNESS IS THE

03:03:37.039 --> 03:03:39.408
STIGMA AND THE SHAME. INTENSA

03:03:39.475 --> 03:03:43.612
VERIS MEANT OF FEELINGS OF AND

03:03:43.679 --> 03:03:45.781
IT'S KIND OF MIRRORED BACK AT

03:03:45.848 --> 03:03:47.816
YOU WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE. WHILE

03:03:47.883 --> 03:03:49.084
I WAS EXPERIENCING THE DOMESTIC

03:03:49.151 --> 03:03:51.887
VIOLENCE POLICE WOULD WOULD COME

03:03:51.954 --> 03:03:53.789
TO THE HOUSE THE FOCUS WAS NOT

03:03:53.856 --> 03:03:55.190
ON ME THE FOCUS WAS ON THE

03:03:55.257 --> 03:03:57.793
PERPETRATOR. SAME THING WHEN THE

03:03:57.860 --> 03:03:59.995
COURT SYSTEM THE FOCUS WAS NOT

03:04:00.062 --> 03:04:02.030
ON ME EXCEPT WAS I GOING TO BE A

03:04:02.097 --> 03:04:03.932
WITNESS TO STRENGTHEN THEIR CASE

03:04:03.999 --> 03:04:05.834
THE FOCUS GIVE ME WAS ON THE

03:04:05.901 --> 03:04:11.940
PERPETRATOR- WHEN I FINALLY WAS

03:04:12.007 --> 03:04:14.109
BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT WAS DPSS

03:04:14.176 --> 03:04:15.778
WITH THE INSTITUTION A

03:04:15.844 --> 03:04:16.879
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL

03:04:16.945 --> 03:04:19.882
SERVICES THAT GAVE ME THE FIRST

03:04:19.948 --> 03:04:23.852
FOCUS ON MYSELF. AND ASK ME THE

03:04:23.919 --> 03:04:25.821
QUESTIONS THAT ALLOWED ME TO

03:04:25.888 --> 03:04:27.823
START THE PATH OF RETURNING TO

03:04:27.890 --> 03:04:30.092
MY LIFE AS GETTING MENTAL HEALTH

03:04:30.159 --> 03:04:32.995
SERVICES GETTING A CASE MANAGER.

03:04:33.061 --> 03:04:36.432
AND OF BEING AND I. WENT TO A

03:04:36.498 --> 03:04:41.870
SHELTER. AS FIRST WAS THE

03:04:41.937 --> 03:04:44.406
FOURTEEN DAY A VIRGIN SEE BAD.

03:04:44.473 --> 03:04:45.774
AND THEN I WAS RETURNED TO

03:04:45.841 --> 03:04:48.043
LIVING OUTSIDE WHAT WHAT I FOUND

03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:50.646
OUT AT THAT SHELTER THAT THE

03:04:50.712 --> 03:04:53.081
ONLY WAY TO GET THAT I WOULD

03:04:53.148 --> 03:04:55.050
HAVE TO WAIT THREE HUNDRED AND

03:04:55.117 --> 03:04:56.952
SIXTY FIVE DAYS MINIMUM TO GET

03:04:57.019 --> 03:05:00.155
HOUSING SERVICES. WAS REALLY.

03:05:00.222 --> 03:05:04.259
DEVASTATING. AND THAT'S THE

03:05:04.326 --> 03:05:07.095
THING THAT- I MEAN YOU HAVE TO

03:05:07.162 --> 03:05:09.164
BE CONSIDERED CHRONICALLY

03:05:09.231 --> 03:05:11.500
HOMELESS IN ORDER TO BECAUSE OF

03:05:11.567 --> 03:05:12.601
THE NEED IS SO GREAT I

03:05:12.668 --> 03:05:14.336
UNDERSTAND THAT WE ALL DO THAT

03:05:14.403 --> 03:05:17.239
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH NEED AND WE

03:05:17.306 --> 03:05:19.808
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING. AND I

03:05:19.875 --> 03:05:21.910
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT TEMPORARY

03:05:21.977 --> 03:05:23.712
SOLUTIONS ARE GREAT. BECAUSE

03:05:23.779 --> 03:05:25.848
THEY GET SOMEONE INSIDE OUT OF

03:05:25.914 --> 03:05:28.016
THIS WHICH I SPENT TIME UNDER.

03:05:28.083 --> 03:05:29.184
BUT WE CAN'T KEEP KICKING THE

03:05:29.251 --> 03:05:31.153

03:05:31.220 --> 03:05:33.188
SOME POINT AND BRACE THE NEED

03:05:33.255 --> 03:05:34.022
FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

03:05:34.089 --> 03:05:36.258
HOUSING. BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE IS

03:05:36.325 --> 03:05:38.393
DEEPLY TRAUMATIZED AND PEOPLE

03:05:38.460 --> 03:05:40.496
ARE FROM BEING HOMELESS FROM

03:05:40.562 --> 03:05:42.731
EXPERIENCING THAT ESPECIALLY THE

03:05:42.798 --> 03:05:44.733

STAYING IN THE A TEMPORARY

03:05:52.241 --> 03:05:54.443
HOUSING IS VERY HOW DIFFICULT

03:05:54.510 --> 03:05:55.577
YOU NEVER YOU'RE ALWAYS

03:05:55.644 --> 03:05:57.713

EIGHT HUNDRED TIME. THAT'S

03:06:07.656 --> 03:06:09.825
WHATEVER HOUSING IS LIKE. IT'S

03:06:09.892 --> 03:06:10.726
ONLY THROUGH PERMANENT

03:06:10.792 --> 03:06:14.596
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THAT ACTUALLY

03:06:14.663 --> 03:06:17.165
. THAT YOU YOU HAVE A FINALLY A

03:06:17.232 --> 03:06:19.535
FEELING OF SAFETY AND YOU DON'T

HAVE TO CONSTANTLY WAKE UP EVERY

03:06:21.904 --> 03:06:23.839
DAY AND WONDER IS TODAY YOU KNOW

03:06:23.906 --> 03:06:25.407
MY GONNA BREAK SOME RULE IS THE

03:06:25.474 --> 03:06:26.975
FUNDING FOR IT DID THAT. IT

03:06:27.042 --> 03:06:28.443
MIGHT MAKE TO YOUR LIMIT

03:06:28.510 --> 03:06:30.512
WHATEVER IT IS AND I JUST WANTED

03:06:30.579 --> 03:06:32.681
CURRENT THAT WE DO NEED A LOT OF

03:06:32.748 --> 03:06:35.150
TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY. HOUSING

03:06:35.217 --> 03:06:38.020
AND SOLUTIONS. BUT NONE OF THEM

03:06:38.086 --> 03:06:40.155
ARE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE NONE OF

03:06:40.222 --> 03:06:42.190
THEM ARE HOUSING. I DID IT DID I

03:06:42.257 --> 03:06:43.825
DON'T KNOW THE I PERSONALLY

03:06:43.892 --> 03:06:44.660
DON'T THINK I WOULD LOOK AT A

03:06:44.726 --> 03:06:47.095
TINY HOME AND THINK OKAY THAT'S

03:06:47.162 --> 03:06:49.765
MY FUTURE. THAT'S GOING TO BE

03:06:49.831 --> 03:06:51.700
WHERE I'M GONNA RETIRE. ENDED SO

03:06:51.767 --> 03:06:53.068
MANY OF THESE TEMPER THESE-

03:06:53.135 --> 03:06:55.237
TEMPORARY SOLUTION YOU CANNOT

03:06:55.304 --> 03:06:57.406
HAVE GUESTS. YOU CANNOT HAVE

03:06:57.472 --> 03:06:59.875
OVERNIGHT GUESTS AND IF YOU DO

03:06:59.942 --> 03:07:00.943
IT'S FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

03:07:01.009 --> 03:07:03.011
TIME THAT'S NOT HOW A PEOPLE

03:07:03.078 --> 03:07:05.013
LIVE BUT THOSE OF US WHO GO

03:07:05.080 --> 03:07:06.248
THROUGH THIS YOU KNOW GONE

03:07:06.315 --> 03:07:08.050
THROUGH TERRIBLE THINGS END UP

03:07:08.116 --> 03:07:09.851
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT

03:07:09.918 --> 03:07:11.320
IS WHAT OUR EXPERT THAT'S HOW WE

03:07:11.386 --> 03:07:14.323
HAVE TO. YOU KNOW WE'RE GRATEFUL

03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:16.592
TO BE INSIDE DEFINITELY. BUT WE

03:07:16.658 --> 03:07:18.961
CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF DIGNITY. AND

03:07:19.027 --> 03:07:20.896
WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF. THESE

03:07:20.963 --> 03:07:22.030
ARE OUR NEIGHBORS AND THAT COULD

03:07:22.097 --> 03:07:23.599
BE ME THAT COULD BE MY NEPHEW

03:07:23.665 --> 03:07:26.268
THAT ONE OF THE- OF PEOPLE SPOKE

03:07:26.335 --> 03:07:27.869
AND SAID THAT I BELIEVE. THAT

03:07:27.936 --> 03:07:28.904
ONE OF THAT THAT ONE OF THEIR

03:07:28.971 --> 03:07:31.306
KIDS. OR GOD SENT WAS GOING

03:07:31.373 --> 03:07:34.843

THROUGH THIS AND IF WE DON'T

03:07:40.482 --> 03:07:41.283

SHARING IT. AND WE DON'T KNOW.

03:07:44.252 --> 03:07:46.121

LOW. MAJORITY 63% IS A MAJORITY

03:10:45.834 --> 03:10:47.969
BUT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT

03:10:48.036 --> 03:10:50.338
CONSIDERED- WHAT I GUESS A SLAM

03:10:50.405 --> 03:10:52.474
DUNK WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ENACT

03:10:52.541 --> 03:10:54.676
SOME SORT OF NEW TAX MEASURE- SO

03:10:54.743 --> 03:10:56.945
I DO BELIEVE THERE IS. THIS

03:10:57.012 --> 03:10:59.514
FRUSTRATION HAS HAS CREATED

03:10:59.581 --> 03:11:02.517
AMONG VOTERS. A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:11:02.584 --> 03:11:04.786
WARINESS IN TERMS OF SPENDING

03:11:04.853 --> 03:11:06.721
MORE MONEY EVEN THOUGH THEY WANT

03:11:06.788 --> 03:11:08.623
TO SEE THE PROBLEM SOLVED NOW.

03:11:08.690 --> 03:11:11.793
WHICH I GUESS YOU COULD SEE AS

03:11:11.860 --> 03:11:12.894
BEING SOMEWHAT COUNTER

03:11:12.961 --> 03:11:14.763
INTUITIVE- BUT I DO THINK IT'S

03:11:14.830 --> 03:11:16.932
IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THEY ARE

03:11:16.998 --> 03:11:18.700
STILL WILLING IT'S JUST. THERE

03:11:18.767 --> 03:11:20.468

03:11:20.535 --> 03:11:21.336
ACCOUNTABILITY CLEAR

03:11:21.403 --> 03:11:23.238
TRANSPARENCY SO THEY KNOW THAT

03:11:23.305 --> 03:11:24.472
WHEN THEY'RE WHEN WE'RE SPENDING

03:11:24.539 --> 03:11:26.241
