MR OF WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL THE ROLL. BURKE HERE. WHEN GREAT. GRAYSON LEVINE. MAYES THERE MULLIN PETRIE-NORRIS QUIRK HERE THREE OF US SAY AUTO. YOU HAVE A COURT. ALL RIGHT. I WITH THAT WILL MOVE TO THE FIRST A GENOM ITEM WHICH IS AB TWELVE OH THREE OF WHICH ARE PRESENTING SO I'M HANDING THIS OVER. TO RIGHT THANK YOU MANAGER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. RIGHT. US SO FIRST I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE AB TWELVE OH THREE SPONSORED BY THE LAW COUNTY LOS ANGELES IS A DISTRICT BILL THAT WILL ENABLE TAXPAYERS TO DISPUTE PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS ANYMORE TIMELY MANNER. IT WOULD SIMPLY EXPAND THE POOL OF POTENTIAL OPTIONS FOR SERVICE ON THE ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHILE ALSO PERMITTING BILL L. A. COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. TO REDUCE THE THREE YEAR WAITING PERIOD. THAT FLOOR FORMER SISTERS EMPLOYEES ARE SUBJECT TO BEFORE BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO SERVE ON AN APPEALS BOARD TO NO LESS THAN ONE YEAR. SHOULD THEY SEE FIT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC ALL IN PERSON APPEAL HEARINGS IN THE COUNTY WERE HALTED FROM MARCH TWENTIETH TO OCTOBER OF MY MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY. CONSEQUENTLY THE NUMBER OF OPEN APPEALS APPLICATIONS REQUIRING HANG HAS GROWN FROM EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY A 44% INCREASE. BUT THE APPLICATION DEADLINE CLOSING IN JUNE THE TOTAL NUMBER IS ONLY EXPECTED TO GROW CONTINUE TRENDING UPWARDS THIS BACKLOG MUST BE ADDRESSED. LAST YEAR WE PASSED LEGISLATION THAT REMOVES THE CAP ON THE NUMBER OF PILLS BOARD BOARDS PERMITTED IN A COUNTY. ADDITIONAL BOARDS WERE CREATED L. A. AS RESULT IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE WORKLOAD ALTHOUGH THE COUNTY CREATED NEW BOARDS TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO TAXPAYERS THEY HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES FINING PEOPLE TO SERVE THIS IS THE PROBLEM AB TWELVE OH THREE ADDRESSES. IF THE COUNTY IS TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL BACKLOG WE MUST PROVIDE IT WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO EXPAND THE UNIVERSE OF POTENTIAL APPEAL BOARD MEMBERS TO OTHERS FROM THE REAL ESTATE FIELD. THEY ARE JUST AS QUALIFIED AS CURRENT BOARD MEMBERS ARE I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS REGARDING THE OVERALL APPEALED FOR PROCESSING AND I WELCOME SO THOSE CONVERSATIONS HOWEVER. THE INTENTION OF THIS MOTHER MEASURE IS NOT TO REFORM THE PROCESS. I REPEAT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO REFORM THE PROCESS BUT RATHER. TO SIMPLY PROVIDE L. A. COUNTY WITH THE FLEXIBILITY. TO RECRUIT POTENTIAL AB MEMBERS IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THE ADDITIONAL BOARDS THAT WERE CREATED TO ADDRESS THE APPEALS AND A TIMELY MATTER. IN RESPONSE TO OPPOSITION CLAIMS I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT EXISTING PROVISIONS PREVENT. FORMER ASSESSOR EMPLOYEES FROM HEARING CASES THAT THEY THEMSELVES WORKED ON DURING THEIR TIME AS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE. DESPITE WHAT MEAL IT MAY HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IS CURRENT ALREADY CORRECT. THIS IS A LOW COST STRAIGHTFORWARD AND NECESSARY MEASURES THAT WILL BENEFIT THE TAXPAYERS OF L. A. COUNTY. WITH ME IN SUPPORT OVER THE PHONE R. JR JEREMY GRAY CHIEF DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE AND JEFF CRANE LOS ANGELES COUNTY ASSESSOR'S. THE BILL. THANK YOU I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I WOULD ASK THE MODERATE TO CONNECT US FIRST WITH JEREMY GRAY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. MR ME YES THIS IS JEREMY THIS IS YOUR ME GREAT CAN YOU HEAR ME YES THANK YOU. PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JEREMY GRAY FOR THE RECORD I AM THE CHIEF DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER. OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OUR OFFICE MANAGES THE COUNTY'S ASSESSMENT APPEALS PROGRAM. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT BILL THIS BILL WOULD ASSESS THE COUNTY. OF LOS ANGELES IN RECRUITING QUALIFIED CANDIDATES WHO ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO US UNDER EXISTING LAW. TO FIELD VACANCY ON OUR ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD AND THEREBY HELP THE COUNTY ADDRESS A VOLUME OF APPEALS AND ASSOCIATED BACKLOG. I SHOULD FIRST POINT OUT THAT OUR COUNTY BY FAR THE LARGEST APPEALS WORKLOAD IN THE STATE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE RECEIVED NEARLY AS MANY APPEALS AS THE NEXT FIVE LARGEST COUNTIES COMBINED. CONSEQUENTLY IT IS CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO CREATE MORE ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARDS THEN WE HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD. THIS WILL REQUIRE MANY MORE. ASSESSMENT APPEALS MEMBERS AB TWELVE ALL THREE WILL HELP US TO INCREASE THE POOL OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES FOR APPOINTMENT BY INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE FIVE YEARS OF RELEVANT PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE IN REAL ESTATE. URBAN PLANNING LAND USE PROFESSIONS THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO US CURRENTLY. THE BILL ALSO WOULD GIVE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE OPTION TO REDUCE OF THE WAITING PERIOD FOR APPOINTMENT OF EXTRASENSORY EMPLOYEES FROM THREE YEARS TO ONE YEAR A VERY COMMON PROVISION IN STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL- REVOLVING DOOR STATUTES AND ORDINANCES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT AB TWELVE ALL THREE WOULD NOT BE THE TOTAL SOLUTION THUS WE HAVE BEGUN TO REACH OUT MORE AGGRESSIVELY TO CURRENT QUALIFIED PERSONS. WHILE WE FACE SEVERE BUDGETARY PROBLEMS. ALL BY THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE PRIORITIZED I REQUEST TO INCREASE THE COMPENSATION THAT AB MEMBERS RECEIVE WHICH OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WILL EVALUATE ALONG WITH MANY OTHER CRITICAL FUNDING REQUEST. AB TWELVE ALL THREE ALONG WITH OTHER STEPS WILL GIVE US THE CAPACITY WE NEED TO MORE QUICKLY HOLD APPEAL HEARINGS SO THAT TAXPAYER AND ASSESSORS RECEIVED. DUE PROCESS THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU UP NEXT WE HAVE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY ASSESSOR JEFFREY PRANG. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- IN OUR WILL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE OH THREE I AM JUST PRAYING I AM THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY ASSESSOR. I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE IS LEADING THE EFFORT TO ADDRESS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY ASSESSMENT APPEALS PROCESS LATEST BUDGET DOES HAVE CHANGES ARE NECESSARY FOR L. A. COUNTY TO UPDATE ITS ASSESSMENT APPEALS PROGRAM TO IMPROVE BOTH EFFICIENCY FOR THE COUNTY. AND EXPEDIENCY FOR TAXPAYERS IN RESOLVING THEIR DISPUTES OVER ASSESSMENTS. AB TWO OR THREE WILL ALLOW L. A. COUNTY TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS BY EXPANDING THE POOL OF QUALIFIED APPLICANTS WHO COULD SERVE ON ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD WHICH WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THIS SYSTEM WHILE PROVIDING TAXPAYERS. WITH MORE EFFICIENT EXPEDIENT AND EQUITABLE PROCESS FOR THEIR APPEALS. THIS YEAR'S SCOPE OF THE CASE LOAD UP IN APPEALS . A. COUNTY REQUIRES URGENT LEGISLATIVE ACTION THE CASELOAD HAS INCREASED FROM ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY- TO OVER FORTY THOUSAND TODAY WELL THERE ARE MANY- REASONS WHY THE NUMBER OF APPEALS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED COVERED NINETEEN AMONG THEM. THE FACT IS THE L. A. COUNTY DOES NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT STRUCTURE OR RESOURCES. TO MANAGE THIS IS SIGNIFICANT CASELOAD. PART OF THE RESULT TAKEN BY SOME REMEMBER BROKEN TWELVE OR THREE PROVIDES FOR A REDUCTION IN THE COOLING OFF PERIOD. FOR FORMER ASSESSOR EMPLOYEES FROM THREE YEARS TO ONE YEAR WHICH IS MUCH MORE COMMON- WAITING PERIOD FORMER GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES. BOB THIS IS A SINGLE YEAR TO COOPER- ALIGNS WITH ALMOST EVERY OTHER- POST EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS. I AM UNAWARE OF ANY ARGUMENT THAT SURE DOES SINGLE OUT APPRAISERS FOR LIKE THE RECORD OFF PERIODS. OTHER REPLY TO OTHER GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES. I UNDERSTAND AND TAKE TO HEART THE CONCERT OF TAXPAYER ORGANIZATIONS HOWEVER RECRUITMENT OF SUFFICIENT ASSESSMENT PEELS BOARD MEMBERS IN THE COUNTY. HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THE SHEER ENORMITY OF THE WORKLOAD L. A. COUNTY. THE VOLUMES HEARINGS RECORDED NINETEEN AND ANTICIPATED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WILL CAUSE BECAUSE- COMPEL US TO TAKE THIS ACTION. AND TWELVE OR THREE WILL SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL- OF ONE OF ONE TOOL OF MANY IN HELPING US ADDRESS THOSE STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES. ADDITIONALLY IF THERE ARE OTHER CAUSES FOR CONCERN REGARDING A BOARD MEMBERS PURCHASE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. S. IS BUT STATED THERE ARE AMPLE RULES AND PROCEDURES. CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN THE REVENUE TAXATION CODE. AS WELL IN THE COUNTIES ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD MANUAL WHICH ADDRESSES BUYERS. AND PROVIDE FOR FAIR AND EQUITABLE HEARINGS OR TAXPAYERS. GIVEN THE HEAVY VOLUME OF APPEALS THAT HAVE OVERWHELMED THE CURRENT CAPACITY OF THE PROCESS OF L. A. COUNTY. I BELIEVE THAT AB TWELVE THREE IS A MUCH NEEDED PART OF THE REMEDY. AND I URGE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU MADAM. CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. IF THE M. MONTEREY WOULD NOW PLEASE OF UP THE MAIN LINE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING TESTIMONY. IS THERE ANYBODY. WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT VIA REMOTE VIDEO STATION AT THIS TIME. ANY OTHER SUPPORT. OKAY. I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WITH THE MODERATE PLEASE CONNECT US WITH SEAN KELLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF TAXPAYERS ADVOCATES. YES MADAM CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR YES. IN HERE MISTER BANKS HERE- AND GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MY NAME IS JOHN KELLY I'M THE PRESIDENT OF DEEPEST QUALITY KELLY AND COMPANY OF PROP PROPERTY TAX ADVOCACY FIRM I'M NOT FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF TAXPAYER ADVOCATES ARE KEITA A STATEWIDE TRADE ASSOCIATION PER PROPERTY TAX CONSULTANTS. IN MY TWENTY FIVE YEARS EXPERIENCE EVER RESOLVED WELL OVER TWO THOUSAND APPEALS AND L. A. COUNTY ALONE. ON BEHALF OF CANADA I RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWELVE OH THREE. LIKE ALL RESPONSIBLE INTERESTED PARTIES WE SPEAK THE ORDERLY AND TIMELY PROCESSING SHARING AND DISPOSITION OF ASSESSMENT APPEALS HOWEVER AB TWELVE R. THREE IS REDUCTION OF THE COOLING OFF PERIOD FROM THREE YEARS TO ONE. WELL FAILED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT IT TAKES TO RESOLVE. AB TWELVE OH THREE SIX TO AMEND SENATE BILLS SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT AND NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN MEASURE WHICH ACCORDING TO ITS LEGISLATIVE HISTORY QUOTE ADDED PROVISIONS TO ENSURE OBJECTIVITY OF APPEALS BOARD MEMBERS. ON QUOTE. THE NEED TO ENSURE OBJECTIVITY IS AS TRUE TODAY AS IT WAS WITH A- WHEN INTO BY THE LEGISLATURE A TAXPAYERS CONTEST OF AN ASSESSMENT WAS DESIGNATED TO BE RESOLVED WITHIN TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF THE GENERAL THAT. THE THREE YEAR PERIOD ACCOUNTED FOR ANY APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AB TWELVE R. THREE WOULD REOPEN THE DEBATE CREEK TAXPAYERS. KEITA'S CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE PROBLEMS IN L. A. COUNTY AND THEN OUR OPPOSITION LETTER HAS PROVIDED NINE RECOMMENDATIONS SOME OF WHICH ARE SUCCESSFULLY USED BY OTHER COUNTY. IN AN EFFORT TO FIND A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE RESOLUTION OF THESE PROBLEMS WE% REQUESTED A MEETING WITH L. A. COUNTY. WE ASK WHY IS L. A. COUNTY BRINGING A BILL TO THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS THROUGH ALTERNATIVE MEANS SO AS LONG AS TWELVE OH THREE UNDERMINE. THE OBJECTIVITY OF ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARDS WE MUST REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE AND. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NOSE UP. THANK YOU MISTER KELLY NOW- WITH THE MODERATE PLEASE HELP CONNECT THIS TO MISTER SCOTT KAUFMAN WITH THE HOVER JOBBERS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. HELLO THIS IS SCOTT CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. OKAY WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE TIME GOOD AFTERNOON I'LL GET STARTED- CURRENT LOG THIS TO QUOTE ENSURE OBJECTIVE OBJECTIVE THE APPEALS BOARD MEMBERS ON QUOTE CHANGING THOSE RULES ARE A CONCERN FOR TAXPAYERS AND A CONCERN FOR THE ASSESSMENT APPEALS PROCESS. EXISTING LAW TO QUALIFY THE PERSON FROM POINT INTO AN ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD IF THE PERSON HAS WEAKENED IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THEIR PLAN TO THE BOARD AN EMPLOYEE OF THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE. THIS BILL WOULD REDUCE THAT PROHIBITION TO ONE YEAR AND CREATE A SITUATION WHERE RECENT CO WORKER TO BE PLACED IN THE POSITION OF DECIDING THE OUTCOME OF AN ASSESSMENT APPEAL OR THEIR FORMER COLLEAGUES PRESENT UNIFORM AB ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY ASSESSOR. THIS RUN THE RISK OF BREEDING BY IT AND UNDERMINING THE INDEPENDENCE OF AB. THE BILL ALSO SEEKS TO CHANGE THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS OF APPOINTEES IN AREAS OF EXPERIENCE EDUCATION CERTIFICATION AND COUNTY WITH A POPULATION OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE. WE BELIEVE THIS COULD PRODUCE ERRONEOUS DECISIONS BY AB FOR BOTH THE ASSESSORS AND TAXPAYERS IT COULD ALSO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF APPEALS OF AB DECISION TO THE COURT IN ORDER TO CORRECT SUCH RONI DECISIONS. AT THIS TIME WE RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CALL. AT THIS TIME WITH THE MODERATE PLEASE NOW OPEN THE MAIN LINE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION TESTIMONY. ANYBODY. IS NOW IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN GO AHEAD I'M SORRY. WE HAVE NO ONE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION VIA REMOTE VIDEO STATION AT THIS TIME. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YEAH I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS- I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS TODAY I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR TRYING TO SOLVE WHAT SEEMS TO BE A REAL PROBLEM THAT CAN INSTALL THEM FOR L. A. COUNTY AND IT'S JUST IT IS IT'S AN INTERESTING. ISSUE TO HAVE LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON IN LA THAT IS CAUSING THIS SO YOU'VE GOT PROPERTY OWNERS WHO BELIEVE THAT THEIR PROPERTIES ARE NOT ASSESSED ACCURATELY- CORRECTLY DO NOT REFLECT THE REAL VALUE- THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE THAT MERIT IN THAT FIELD. SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S IT AT YOU KNOW IN ISSUE- AND I JUST FOUND THAT ASSESSOR'S OFFICES ARE REALLY THERE TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE TO- MAXIMIZE REVENUE TO THE COUNTY. SO THE COUNTY HAS THE BUDGET TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS FALL ON THE SIDE OF THE TAX PAYER WHEN THEY LOOK TO MAXIMIZE THAT AND SO YOU KNOW I DO HEAR THE CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING- STATED- PARTICULARLY BECAUSE LIKE EVEN IF YOU WEREN'T THE ONE WHO ASSESSED THAT PROPERTY THERE ARE A LOT OF PROPERTIES IN LA. ARE YOU IN YOU'RE GONNA BE AT LEAST A YEAR REMOVED YOU MAY BE IN YOU KNOW A BIT OF A STICKY JAM WHEN YOU'VE GOT FORMER COLLEAGUE THAT DID SO OR YOU MAY HAVE A WORLD VIEW WHERE YOU ARE THERE TO MAXIMIZE JUST LIKE YOU DID IN YOUR JOB YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT YOUR THERE TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF THAT PROPERTY SAID THE COUNTY DOES RECEIVE. THAT TAX REVENUE SO THESE ARE REAL CONCERNS BUT THAT'S NOT THE SOLE ISSUE THAT THE BILL IS TRYING TO SOLVE WHICH IS WE JUST NEED MORE CAPABLE PEOPLE TO PROCESS ALL THESE APPEALS SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE ONE FOR LOS ANGELES TO BE CAREFUL. ABOUT HOW THEY- DEVELOP THE NAY. OF THESE BOARDS I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ONE THERE'S GOING TO BE MULTIPLE YOU SEEM TO HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS AND SO MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CITY. HOW DO PEOPLE WITH THE SKILL SET IN. THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE OF THE COUNTY RATHER. HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SOUTHWEST PART OF THE COUNTY AND HOW DO YOU PROPERLY- I PRAISE- AND THEN ASSESS- THESE PROPERTIES WHEN THEY'RE SO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT- SO I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO DO IT- BUT BE MINDFUL THAT WHEN YOU CREATE THOSE. MEMBERSHIPS THAT- YOU REALLY DO WANT THEM. TO BE OBJECTIVE. IN NOT BE STACKED ON. THE SIDE OF ANYBODY BUT IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN OBJECTIVELY- INFORM WHETHER OR NOT- THE APPEAL IS MERITED THANK YOU. YOU NEED TO WOULD YOU LIKE I DON'T KNOW I'LL ANSWER MAFIA- IT MAY BE BEST FOR- ONE OF YOUR WITNESSES TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS THIS QUESTION THERE NINE SUGGESTIONS HERE ON HOW TO. BETTER RECRUIT A MEMBERSHIP. IT ALSO SPEED UP THE PROCESS- AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF- THE ASSESSMENT- PROCESS WILL LUCK TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY OF THESE NINE SUGGESTIONS OF THE ASSESSOR'S WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEM AND POSSIBLY IMPLEMENT THEM. HI ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I HAVE A FEW SAME WITH- DELCO LAST. DID HE WANT JEFFREY ANSWER THAT DO YOU DO YOU WANT DANCE NOW DO YOU WANT I CAN I CAN ANSWER AT THE END OR IF JEFFREY WANTS TO ANSWER THAT SORRY THE NEW YORK ARGENTI BRING LIKE THIS STUFF. IF YOU WANT IT I THINK. OKAY MR- PLAYING. FRANK YES THIS IS. A COUPLE ECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO JUST CORRECT- MISCONCEPTIONS THE STATEMENT WAS MADE PREVIOUSLY ASSESSORS ARE NOT INVOLVED IN REVENUE WE ARE NOT A REVENUE DEPARTMENT OUR JOB IS TO APPLY A FAIR AND ACCURATE VALUE ON A PIECE OF PROPERTY REVENUE IS NOT A CONSIDERATION OF HOW WE DO OUR JOB IT IS A BY PRODUCT OF OUR DUTY US DOING OUR JOB WE ARE OBLIGATED TO ASSIGN A VALUE WITH THE VALUE WAS HIGHER OR LOWER BUT REVENUE WAS NEVER PART OF OUR OUT. OF OUR CHARGE THAT'S WHY THE- REVENUE DEPARTMENT IS SEPARATE FROM THE ASSESSOR'S. SUCH AS OFFICE- SO WE DON'T. BYE BYE BY PUSHING ADDITIONAL VALUE ON A PIECE OF PROPERTY WE WOULD BE UNILATERALLY AND ILLEGALLY- INCREASING TAXES OUTSIDE THE ABOUT THE LOSS OF OUR WE WERE VERY WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT MAKING CERTAIN OF OUR OUR VALUES ARE ACCURATE AND UP AND FAIR. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE MADE SOME OF THEM- WE AGREE WITH SOME OF THEM WE DO NOT AGREE WITH SOME OF THEM WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE ARE ALREADY IN PLACE BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THE VOLUME OF CASES- OURS IS SO SIGNIFICANT IT MAKES SENSE THAT MAKES MANEUVERABILITY TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. VERY VERY VERY DIFFICULT WE ARE HANDLING- CASES ON A JUST IN TIME DELIVERY BECAUSE THE NUMBER THAT COME UP- THAT ARE A BETTER SCHEDULE FOR HEARINGS- MY GOAL IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CASES SO THAT WE CAN SPEND MORE TIME. WITH EACH TAXPAYER TO RESOLVE THEIR ISSUES ADMINISTRATIVELY IF POSSIBLE PRIOR TO A HEARING AT THE MOMENT.WE'RE SIMPLY UNABLE TO DO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY. MATTER I'LL BE SUPPORTING. THANK YOU. PLEASE THE HAS SOME NICE SO BUTTON. JUST REALLY STARTED DIGGING INTO THIS- THIS THIS MORNING. AND IT SEEMS TO BE THAT THE ONE STICKING POINT. IS IN THIS THREE YEAR VERSUS ONE YEAR. AND I'M I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS A LITTLE BIT ACTUALLY- NOT ONLY DID I CALL BOTH OF MINE THE ASSESSORS IN BOTH RIVERSIDE AND SAN MARINO COUNTER TO GET THEIR THOUGHTS ACTUALLY- CALLED SOME STAFF MEMBERS AT THE FIND OUT NOW THAT WE'RE TO THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE THAT I'VE KNOWN TO ASK WHAT THEIR THOUGHTS WERE ON ON THE MATTER THAT IF THEY- WERE GOING TO RETIRE FROM- THE- THE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S OFFICE AND THEN GO BACK TO WANT TO BE ON. THESE APPEALS BOARD- AND BOTH OF THEM HAD SAID BUT NO WAY AM I GOING TO GO BACK AFTER I'M RETIRED I'M DONE THERE'S NO WAY I'M TO GO BACK AND WORK- AND TO BE ON THE BILL'S BOREDOM WHEN I'M DONE I'M I'M DONE. BUT IT BUT IT DID IT WAS INTERESTING AND IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT I. THAT THAT I HAD. IS AND I WANNA LOVE- ACTUALLY REITERATE WHAT THE GENTLEMAN SAID REPRESENTING THE ASSESSORS IS THAT. MY TWO ASSESSORS ABOUT RIVERSIDE. AND SAMBAR DINO COUNTY I CAN ASSURE. EVERYONE THAT'S IF IT'S HERE AND THOSE THAT ARE LISTENING. THAT THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN INCREASING THEIR BOTH A VERY CONSERVATIVE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN INCREASING. OUR REVENUE A TO THE COUNTY THEIR JOB IS TO BE ABLE TO APPLY. THE LAW AND WHEN THEIR APPEALS THAT COME BEFORE THESE APPEAL BOARDS. THE GOAL IS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE TO- APPLY THE LAW THE PROBLEM IS THE LAW CAN BE VERY COMPLEX AND COMPLICATED. AND PEOPLE THAT ARE APPOINTED TO THESE BOARDS DON'T REALLY FULLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE LAW. MIGHT BE. AND SO THERE IS A BENEFIT TO HAVING FORMER EMPLOYEES WHO UNDERSTAND THE LAW WHO MIGHT WANT TO SERVE. TO SIT ON THESE BOARDS TO MAKE SURE TO PROPERLY APPLY. THE LAW. WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH IS IN THE OPPOSITION THEY WERE SAYING WERE FOR GOING TO BRING ALLOW THESE- FORMER RETIREES TO SERVE. IF UP. AFTER THREE YEARS BUT GOING FROM THREE YEARS TO ONE YEAR. THAT SEEMS TO BE THAT THE BETTER STILL WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THREE YEARS OR ONE YEAR THEY'RE STILL THEY'RE STILL ABLE TO. TO SERVE. AND SO IF I CAN HAVE SOMEBODY FOM THE OPPOSITION TALK ABOUT. THAT BECAUSE I'M REALLY STRUGGLING WITH. IF WE'RE ALLOWING THEM AT ALL. THE ARGUMENT SHOULD BE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SERVE. BUT. IS MR KELLY OR MR KAUFMAN. ON THE PHONE. THEY CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION YES. HI I AM AND I THINK I CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUE- SPECIFICALLY- I'M SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. MAYBE IT WAS STATE YOUR- JOHN KELLY THANK YOU SHOT. GO AHEAD SORRY ABOUT THAT- YES I BELIEVE THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THERE IS THERE ISN'T. ANY ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS BIAS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. BUT THE WAY THAT THE REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE WORKS IS THAT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE MAIN. AND THEN THERE A TWO STATUTE FOR RESOLVING ASSESSMENT THEREFORE THE THREE YEARS MAKES SENSE AS A COOLING OFF PERIOD. AS THE STATUTE READ IT IS RESOLVED NOW THE LEGAL DATE- THE VALUATION DATE WOULD BE JANUARY FIRST. AND THEORETICALLY AN ASSESSOR COULD LEAD HIM THAT SAME DAY AND THEN IT HERE. HIS OR HER OWN CASE. SO THAT THE REASON WHY THE THREE YEAR PERIOD IT WAS INCORPORATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE I'M SORRY SAID THEORETICALLY CAN YOU THE- GET WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN IN THEORY BECAUSE THERE IT'S AN EASY FIX WE HAVE THE PARTS OF AMAZING WHAT WE CAN DO HERE WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT LANGUAGE IN BILLS AND FIX THAT ABOUT THIRTY IN LIKE THAT'S THAT IF THAT'S IF THAT'S THE CASE- SO. WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THEORETICALLY. WHEN THE ORIGINAL NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN LEGISLATION WAS PUT IN PLACE. THERE WAS A SIX MONTH TIME PERIOD BETWEEN VALUATION AND APPEAL. AND THEN THERE WAS A TWO YEAR PERIOD WHERE THOSE APPEALS WOULD BE RESOLVED. WHICH IS WHY THE THREE YEAR PERIOD WAS PUT INTO PLACE AT THE BEGINNING. NOW WE HAVE AN ISSUE WHERE A SITTING ASSESSOR. AND WITH ALL DUE. RESPECT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT THEY'RE BIASED IT'S JUST WHETHER OR NOT THEY COULD SET. AND RESOLVE THE CASE THAT THEY WERE EITHER APPROVED FOR OR A SUPERVISOR- OR- IN THAT SAME GROUP BUT NOT WHAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE. OKAY IT. TELL ME ANSWER THE QUESTION IS A XIN- BUT I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR ONLY SO WE HAVE GONE TO LEDGE% COUNCIL WE HAVE AN ORAL OPINION FROM LEAD COUNSEL AND THAT AND FORMER EMPLOYEE CANNOTYOUR CASE THAT THEY HAVE WORKED ON ONE PLATE IT'S JUST IT'S ALREADY IN LIFE IN COMMON LAW SO THIS NOTION THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN IS. UNFORTUNATELY I LISTEN I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAPPEN IF YOU WAITED THE SYSTEM OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE OF THE OVERWHELMING SYSTEM IT WAS EASIER TO MANIPULATE THE APPEALS PROCESS IT IS VERY TIMELY PROCESS AND SO I GET THAT THERE'S OPPOSITION THAT DOES NOT WANT THERE TO BE MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE BILLS ACTUALLY TO BE PROCESSED ON TIME BECAUSE THE AUTOMATIC DEFAULT IS IF THEY'RE NOT PROCESSING TIME THEN THEY WIN THEIR APPEAL. SO I GET ALL THAT BUT THE REALITY BUT TO CONTINUE TO IS TO SAY THAT FORMER EMPLOYEES CAN WORK ON THESE CASES IT'S JUST NOT THE LAW THE LAW SAYS OPPOSITE AND WE CAN WE HEAR AN COLLEGE COUNCIL IF WE NEED IT BUT WE WENT AND GOT IF THEIR WORK IF THAT WAS NOT ALREADY LAW I GUARANTEE YOU WE WOULD ADD IT TO THE BILL I DON'T WANT I WANT THE PROCESS TO BE FAIR I WANT THE PROCESS TO HAVE MERIT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID SOME APPEALS HAVE MERIT SOME DON'T AND I WANT THE PROCESS TO BE. TO BE WELL EXECUTED IN L. A. COUNTY THERE'S A REASON THIS IS SPECIFIC L. A. COUNTY WE'RE SEEING A HUGE INFLUX BUT THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GAIN THE SYSTEM BASED ON THE INEQUITY OF THE INEFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW WITH SO FEW PEOPLE. KNOW OTHER SITUATION CALLS FOR A THREE YEAR COOLING OFF PERIOD NOT OUR OWN NOT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY THREE YEARS IS AN EXTREMELY LONG COOLING OFF PERIOD AND WITH ALREADY IN PLACE LAW THAT YOU CANNOT HEAR CASES THAT YOU HAVE WORKED ON I'M I AND MY FRUSTRATION IS THE CONTINUING USE OF THAT RHETORIC WITHOUT ANY BASIS IN LAW OR FACT. SO IF SOMEONE WANTS TO SHOW. ME WHERE LEAD COUNSEL IS WRONG I HAPPILY ADD TO THIS BILL. THAT THAT NOT BE A. MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A CAR WOULD AND I WILL THIS SINCE YOU SAID THAT THERE'S YOU HAVE A LEAD COUNSEL OPINION WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO MAKE THAT PUBLIC IF IT'S AN ORAL PAIN YOU CAN COLLEGE COUNCIL YOURSELF BUT IT'S IN OUR OPINION THAT IT'S AN KICKED IN IF YOU COULD AND IF ANYONE AND EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM COULD TAKE ME AT MY WORD. THAT IF IN FACT THEY FIND THAT THAT IS NOT THE ACTUAL LAW AND THAT LET'S COUNCIL IS WRONG. THEN LET ME KNOW WHEN WE'LL PUT IT IN THE BILL BUT IT'S JUST IT'S REPETITIVE TO PUT IN THE BILL AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALLOWED. IT'S COMMON LAW IT'S NOT ALLOWED. THE I WILL- I'LL ASK I'LL I'LL GO ASK THE COUNCILS THAT'S ONE OF MY CONCERN AS WELL AS- IT'S JUST IT'S JUST IT'S MORE OF THE- IT'S- AND IN ONE OF THE CONCERN. THAT I HAVE MAINLY IS IT'S A THREE YEAR PERIOD. THE I GUESS IS FROM THE TAX PAYER SIDE. KNOWING THAT MAYBE A IN THE PRAISE A SPECIALIST WHO WORKED ON MY CASE. AND THEN A YEAR LATER IS LEAD. INTO THE OUT OVERSEE MY APPEAL I THINK WOULD MAKE ME VERY NERVOUS. OR DEPRESSED THE APPRAISER- SPECIALIST- OR FORMER EMPLOYEES NOW ON THE APPEAL. WHO IS VERY CLOSE TO. YOU KNOW OR PARTNER WITH ANOTHER APPRAISER SPECIALIST SUPERVISOR- THAT. NOW IS OVERSEE MY CASE THAT WOULD MAKE ME NERVOUS AS A TAXPAYER I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE ONE PERIOD THREE PERIOD MAKES PEOPLENERVOUS AND- I OF ALL BE HAVE MORE THAN HAPPY TO REACH OUT TO THAT COUNCIL IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT OPINION AND IF SO- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR- WILLINGNESS TO YOU KNOW FIX THAT ISSUE IF THAT IS THE CASE YEAH NO ABSOLUTELY LET'S AND WE WANT THE SYSTEM TO WORK AND WE WANT IT TO WORK WELL. AND IT OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T WORK WELL IF THERE'S ANY SORT OF BIAS HOWEVER THREE YEARS IS NOT IS NOT GET NECESSARY TO HAVE IT BE THREE YEARS TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO BIAS QUITE FRANKLY EVEN IN A YEAR AT THERE THERE THEY MAY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE WHO HAVE COME ON TO THE BOARD I MEAN THAT'S JUST. THERE IN THE SAME BUSINESS RIGHT SO ONE YEARS THREE YEARS IT'S NOT THAT IS NOT GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE HOWEVER I WILL ATTEST THAT IF FOR WHATEVER REASON ANYBODY FINDS THAT IT IS NOT. THAT YOU MUST RECUSE YOURSELF OR THAT A FORMER EMPLOYEE CANNOT HEAR THESE CASES. IT WILL BE PUT IN THE BILL OKAY THANK YOU. MEDICINE WOMAN PLEASE. YEAH SERVICE TWO QUESTIONS FOR THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE- IT IS NUMBER ONE AM I CORRECT IN UNDERSTANDING THAT LA. OF CALIFORNIA'S COUNTIES THESE KIND OF UNIQUELY OVERWHELMED BY APPEALS AND- I INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO PROCESS THOSE. AND NUMBER TWO- IN ADDITION TO GETTING THIS- YEAH THIS LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO THIS LEGISLATIVE FIX. ARE YOU ALSO EVALUATING BEST PRACTICES AND EFFECTIVE PROCESS SEES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN OTHER CALIFORNIA COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS THAT IT'S EFFECTIVE AND A SWIFT FOR TAXPAYERS. YES THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER YES. YES WE ARE EVALUATING OTHER OUT BEST PRACTICES IS THIS MULTIPLE THING THANK. YEAH IF POSSIBLE ALL THE SPEAKERS BECAUSE WE DON'T SEE YOUR FACE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF YOU JUST LET US KNOW WHO YOU ARE AT THE BEGINNING THANK YOU. MY APOLOGIES AGAIN THIS IS A ASSESSOR JEFFREY PRANG L. L. A. COUNTY SO ONE- THE FIRST QUESTION WAS- ARE WE GOING TO BE OVERWHELMED THE TRUTH IS WE'RE OVERWHELMED AND NOW WE ARE STILL PROCESSING BACKLOGS FROM THE RECESSION OF OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE CERTAIN- TAXPAYER ADVOCATES HAVE CREATED A SYSTEM THEY GAME THE SYSTEM THEY'VE CREATED A WAY TO MONETIZE THE SYSTEM WHICH RESULTS IN HAVING LITERALLY. THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PEELS FILED ANNUALLY OF WHICH THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE WITHOUT MERIT ARE ULTIMATELY WITHDRAWN BUT CONSUMING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PERSONNEL HOURS AND- IN DELAYING MORE MERITORIOUS CASES ON ANNUAL BASIS- WE DO WE ARE WE ARE EXPLORING AND WOULD HAVE WILL IMPLEMENT ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK BETTER. AND MORE EXPEDIENT WAY WHICH IS WHY WE'RE SUPPORTING IT ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE OH THREE HAVING SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF QUALIFIED BOARD MEMBERS TO ENSURE THAT THESE THE CURRENT SIX SOON TO BE SEVEN SEVEN APPEALS BOARDS CAN MEET EVERY DAY TO HANDLE THIS- BOB THIS BACKLOG WILL BE CRITICAL TO REDUCING THOSE OUT THOSE BACKLOGS THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE BUT- BUT IN REALITY WE NEED TO GET THIS BACKLOG DOWN BY ABOUT 50% BEFORE WE CAN START REALLY HAVING A LOT OF MANEUVERABILITY. TO IMPLEMENT- OTHER STRATEGIES MADAM CHAIR OF MEMBERS I APOLOGIZE TO INTERJECT THIS IS JEREMY GREAT REPRESENTING THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND- I THINK ASSESSOR PRANG IS DOING TO- BUT EXCELLENT JOB HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF WHAT WE'RE DOING- AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION FOR THE BODY OF THE ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD IT. IN FACT INDEPENDENT FROM THE- OFFICE AND THEY ARE POINT BY LOCAL. BOARD OF SOME. AND OVERSEEN BY THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE BOARD OF WHICH I'M HERE REPRESENTING TODAY AND I WOULD LIKE TO AGREE WITH- THE ASSESSOR- AND- JUST HIGHLIGHT JUST VARIOUS THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION SPECIFICALLY. WITHIN L. A. COUNTY WE REALIZED THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL IS NOT A PANACEA IT IT IS NOT. OF A SINGULAR FOCUS FOR US AND WE ARE DOING MANY OTHER THINGS TO NOT ONLY REALIZE ADDITIONAL EFFICIENCIES WITHIN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT- RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS. ARE STREAMLINING PROCESS SEES- SCHEDULING- ETCETERA- BUT BUT BUT IS IDENTIFIED BY OUR ASSESSOR. WHAT WHAT AB TWELVE ALL THREE ACTUALLY DOES FOR US IS IT WIDENS THE CANDIDATE POOL FOR OUR BOARD. TO APPOINT QUALIFIED MEMBERS AND BEER BY INCREASES OUR CAPACITY TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL HEARINGS AND ENSURE THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS RECEIVE FAIR AND UNBIASED. RULINGS OUT OF. SIGHT AND I KNOW I DO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT THE BILL DOES MIGHT MY QUESTION. ORIGINALLY WAS. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT'S BEEN JUST THE L. A. COUNTY IT HAS FOUND ITSELF. OVERWHELMED BY THIS ISSUE AND IF THAT IS IN FACT THE CASE I THINK HM IT'S KIND OF THIS AND I'M SUPPORT INVOLVED BUT IT'S DISINGENUOUS TO SUGGEST THAT IT IS. THE FAULT OF TAX PAYER ORGANIZATIONS OR INDIVIDUAL TAX PAYERS GAMING THE SYSTEM WHEN OTHER COUNTIES- MANAGING TO DO TO DEAL WITH THIS EFFECTIVELY WHICH TO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE SO- I GUESS I WOULD SERVE CHALLENGE THAT AS A CORE PROMISE AND THE CHALLENGE ALSO IN ADDITION TO. EXPANDING THE POOL OF ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS TO PURSUE SOME OTHER STRATEGIES TO- TO RECTIFY THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE GONNA PLAN BY THREE AND FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES OTHER COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH THIS WE JUST MADE THIS JUST FOR L. A. COUNTY AND AT SOME POINT OTHER COUNTY'S NAME ON IT BUT RIGHT NOW I'M NOT. SO. OTHER COUNTIES ARE. I IT OKAY THANK YOU TO THE CHECK. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR ME- MADAM CHAIR FOR YOURSELF OR- THE ASSESSOR RDM CEO OF L. A. COUNTY- FIRST QUESTION HOW MANY FORMER SISTER PERSONNEL MEET THE ONE YOUR REQUIREMENT VERSUS THE THREE YEAR REQUIREMENTS DON'T DO YOU KNOW.

BEING FINANCIALLY BLINDSIDED BY A LIEN PLACED ON THEIR ACCOUNT BY THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THE PRIORITY OF OUR SOLDIERS SERVING SHOULD NOT BE A TAX DISPUTE MORE PENALTIES WHILE THEY ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES FOR US OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD NOT NOR HAS IT EVER BEEN. THE PROCESS FOR PROTECTING DEPLOYED INDIVIDUALS FROM TAX PENALTIES IS AN EXTENSIVE COORDINATION BETWEEN F. T. B. AND THE IRS AND THE TAX PAYER HOWEVER THIS DID NOT HAPPEN FOR FAMILIES OF DEPLOYED MEMBERS THIS HAD- THIS HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

BURKE PARK- IN THE ANALYSIS IT SAYS THIS IS ALREADY THE POLICY SO. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THE BILL MAKE. WELL EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE POLICY THERE'S SOME FOR- FOLKS ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS SO MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN KEEP WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PROCEDURES ARE ARE SOLIDIFIED SO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN EVEN THOUGH IT IS ACCORDING TO F. OF THE ANALYSIS AGAIN IT'S TOP AND SOLD MY GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY. THE REASONS AS TO WHY IT DID HAPPEN EVEN THOUGH IT'S ALREADY PART OF THE PROCEDURE AND- AND WE'VE MADE A COMMITMENT TO THE AUTHOR THAT WE WILL KEEP WORKING TO FIND WHAT THAT TECHNICAL ISSUE IS THAT ALLOWED IT TO CAN YES ABSOLUTELY AND AGAIN I THE INTENT IS THAT- IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO TWO OTHER- MILITARY FAMILIES WHILE THEY'RE DEPLOYED AGAIN. ON THE ANALYSIS STATES THAT IT WAS A- THAT IT'S ALREADY IMPALA BY AGAIN IT HAS HAPPENED SO. THE GOAL IS TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN EITHER BY. I'M MAKING SURE THAT THE POLICIES IN THE PROCEDURES ARE BEING FOLLOWED OR TO IDENTIFY THE REASON WHY DID HAPPEN. SO I THINK THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS ONE WOULD BE JUST HAPPEN AUDIT. OKAY I DO NOT THINK THIS IS. I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING THAT'S MY MAIN CONCERN- AND I'D MUCH RATHER YOU DO THIS THROUGH AN AUDIT SO ALL NOT BE VOTING.

ON THE OR THE REASON THAT LIKE THIS FLU- WHAT'S THROUGH THE CRACKS AGAIN. IF IN FACT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BILL AND WE CAN FIX IT THROUGH THE BILL AND IF WE CAN'T THEN AGAIN I'M COMMITTED- TO. WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO MAKING SURE THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN EITHER BY- MAKING THAT THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES STRONGER SO BAD. THAT THE COMMUNICATION IS. BETTER I GUESS. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE. IF IT'S AN LAW THEN SOMETHING DID HAPPEN AND IT FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS. ALL RIGHT WELL AS LONG AS YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. AND WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CHAIR I WILL VOTE I THANK YOU BUT I REALLY THINK AN AUDIT WOULD BE THE BEST. WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING WRONG AND THEREFORE HOW TO FIX IT I'M JUST NOT SURE THIS WILL OKAY. THINKING I'VE- THAT I APPRECIATE- AND AGAIN I SAID I'M DONE J. LACK SO I WILL. BE TALKING TO THE CHAIR ON MISTER SALAS TO SEE IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ON. AUDIT THANK YOU. GOOD ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AND STUFF- MADAM.

THIS MEASURE IS ONE OF MANY INTRODUCED THIS YEAR BY THE LEGISLATURE AIMING TO HELP OUR STATE RECOVER FROM THE FISCAL STRAIN OF THE PAST YEAR WITH MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS UNEMPLOYED AND THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES HAMPERED BY THE PANDEMIC THE STATE MUST USE ALL TOOLS AVAILABLE TO STABILIZE AND REBUILD OUR REVENUE SOURCES SECOND. AB EIGHT SEVENTY NINE IS ONE OF THESE TOOLS I WOULD ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA TAX AMNESTY AND REVENUE RECOVERY ACT THIS MEASURE WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TAXPAYERS TO CLEAR OUTSTANDING TAX LIABILITY OWED FOR PRIOR TAX YEARS BY PAYING A DEFINED AMOUNT USING THE UNDERLYING TAX LIABILITY IN RETURN FOR A WAIVER OF A PURE. ARE CRUDE PENALTIES MARC MODELED AFTER THE STATE'S PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL TAX AMNESTY PROGRAMS MOST RECENTLY IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE TAX AMNESTY IS A PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE TOOL THAT DEMONSTRATES A CREATIVE SOLUTION FOR DRYING IN REVENUE WITHOUT ISSUING ADDITIONAL TAX BURDENS INCENTIVIZING NON COMPLIANT TAXPAYERS TO COME FORWARD IN GOOD FAITH CREATES A PATHWAY FOR FAMILIES TO EMERGE FROM PASSED YOU LIABILITIES WITHOUT THE FEAR OF SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES. IN ADDITION TO HELPING STRUGGLING TAXPAYERS THIS MEASURE ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE IN TIMES OF FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY BUT TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AMNESTY PROGRAM BROUGHT IN A TOTAL GROSS REVENUE OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THIS WAS OFF THIS WAS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WHICH DEMONSTRATED THE VOLUME UP TAXPAYERS THAT WERE LOOKING TO COME HOLE WITH THEIR TAX LIABILITIES IN GOOD FAITH. AB EIGHT SEVENTY NINE AS WRITTEN PROVIDES A SIMILAR OUTLOOK WITH STDS TWENTY TWENTY ONE ANALYSIS PROJECTING GROSS REVENUES OF NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION ASK THE WITH THE PREVIOUS. ITERATION THERE IS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR THAT TO BE ON UNDER ESTIMATE OF ACTUAL READ. GEN FOR THIS MEASURE. ALL OF THIS WITHOUT RAISING ANY EXISTING TAXES. AB EIGHT SEVENTY NINE PROVIDES THE UNIQUE AND CREATIVE FRAMEWORK THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO STABILIZE REVENUE SOURCES AND REDUCE TAX BURDENS ON STRUGGLING ENTITIES.

WITH AN INCREASED USE OF E-COMMERCE FOR RETAIL PURCHASES ONLINE RETAILERS HAVE SHIFTED TO SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS TO PLATFORMS CALLED MARKETPLACE FACILITATORS UNDER EXISTING LAW MARKET PLACE'S SOLICITORS COLLECT INTERNET SALES AND USE TAXES WHICH IS HELPFUL TO SMALLER RETAILERS AND THE STATE TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON RETAILERS AND INCREASE THE COMPLIANCE HOWEVER FEES ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC PRODUCTS ARE STILL BEING COLLECTED BY THE RETAILERS THEMSELVES CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY COLLECTS FEES ON PRODUCTS TO MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR INSTANCE THE STATE COLLECTS FEES. WHEN NEW TIRES ARE SOLD WITH THOSE HE'S GOING TOWARDS GRANTS FOR TYRE RECYCLERS IN PROGRAMS TO FIGHT AIR POLLUTION. THE STATE ALSO COLLECTS FEES ON THE SALE OF REPLACEMENT LEAD ACID BATTERIES WITH THOSE FUNDS GOING TOWARD CLEANUP AND MONITORING SITES THAT HAVE BEEN CONTAMINATED BY THE OPERATION OF LEAD ACID BATTERY RECYCLING FACILITIES. THESE FEES HELP REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE PRODUCTS AND DIVERTS THE VOLUME OF THESE OFTEN TOXIC PRODUCTS FROM ENTERING OUR LANDFILLS. AT LEAST NINE STATES ALREADY REQUIRE MARKETPLACES SOLICITORS TO COLLECT DURING THAT SPECIFIC PRODUCT OR SERVICE FEES OR TAXES IN ADDITION TO SALES AND USE TAX.

TWO- BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I REPRESENTS ONE FORTY OF THE WORLD'S LEADING INTERNET COMPANIES INCLUDING SEVERAL ONLINE MARKETPLACES- ONE OF OUR MAIN CONCERNS OF MAYBE FORTUNATE TO IS THE WAY THAT IT UNDERMINES POTENTIALLY THE LANGUAGE OF AB ONE FORTY SEVEN FROM ACT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- AB ONE FORTY SEVEN REPRESENTATIVES AGREEMENT THAT PARK PLACES WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE RETAILERS FOR SALES TAX PURPOSES ONLY. I AB FOURTEEN R. TWO HOWEVER EFFECTIVELY CONSIDERS A MARKETPLACE RETAILER FOR PURPOSES. OF OTHER TAXES AND FEES READ BELIEVE THIS MAY BE FORTUNATE TO DOES HARDLY CAN BE APPROPRIATE TO INCLUDE ANY DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE- SIMILAR TO EIGHTY ONE FORTY SEVENTIES COMPLIANCE- FOR COMPANIES. ADDITIONALLY AB FOURTEEN R. TWO APPLIES AB ONE QUESTION FALL APPROACH THAT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE DIVERSITY OF BUSINESS MODELS THAT EXIST IN ONLINE COMMERCE FOR MANY OF OUR MARKETPLACES IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN WHICH FEES SHOULD BE COLLECTED ABOUT IT BECAUSE- THEY SIMPLY DON'T HAVE OR MAINTAIN AN INVENTORY- LET ALONE THE STOCK KEEPING UNIT SYSTEM AS AS MANY RETAILERS DO- SO THIS WOULD BE A BURKE OWNERSHIP. ONEROUS AND BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS AFTER THESE MARKETPLACES TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM TO TRACK AND MANAGE- WHICH YOU SHOULD BE COLLECTED AND REMITTED AND FOR WHICH PRODUCTS. SEARCH FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB FORTUNATE TO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION WITH YOUR DOCTOR'S OFFICE ON. THIS MATTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER WITNESS ENOUGH. SEEN ON ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE VIDEO ROOM. ANY IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEEING NINE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES SIR. SO AS I UNDERSTAND THE BELL JUST IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM IF I'M SELLING SOMETHING ON EBAY THIS WOULD REQUIRE EBAY TO COLLECT THE TAX AND REMIT. WE ALREADY HAVE THEM COLLECTING DATA STATE TAXES WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO COLLECT THERE ARE FOUR FEES THAT THIS WILL ALSO REQUIRE THEM TO COLLECT AND ENERGIZING YEAH SO WE ONE FORTY SEVEN IS LONG PAST WE ARE BENEFITING FROM THAT. REGULARLY BUT THIS WOULD JUST ADD FOR OTHER FEES THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK AT TO. COLLECT AS WELL OKAY SO AS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL MENTIONED I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL I THINK IT JUST COMPLETES THE CIRCLE ON WHAT WE WHAT WE ARE AND ONE FORTY SEVEN I CAN ASSURE YOU IS SOMEONE WHO SELLS THINGS ON EBAY FROM TIME TO TIME I WOULD DATE NO IDEA THAT THESE FEES EVEN EXIST. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS YES. I'M NOT SURE THERE'S A- IN ONE OF THE OPPOSITION LETTERS- IT. MAKES THE CLAIM THAT THIS BILL UNDERMINES- THAT CAREFULLY NEGOTIATE LANGUAGE OF AB ONE FORTY SEVEN- AND SO. I THOUGHT MAYBE SINCE YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF THAT IF YOU COULD TALK BECAUSE IT'S NEVER GOOD. TO MAKE A DEAL IF YOU WILL TO NEGOTIATE SOMETHING AND THEN AFTERWARDS- BREAK THAT DEAL THERE RIGHT AFTER SO CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT A BIT I HAPPILY WILL CLARIFY THAT I WAS IN THE ROOM IN THAT CONVERSATION HAD I HAD IT WITH THE- WITH THE FOLKS. I WHAT MY BILL DID WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THIS BILL DID AND WAS NEVER EVER WAS IT COMMENTED ON THAT THIS BILL WOULD NEVER MOVE FORWARD. THAT THESE FEES WOULD NEVER BE COLLECTED. AND IT WAS NEVER STATED IT WAS NEVER PART OF THE CONVERSATION WE WERE VERY VERY FOCUSED AND WE HAVE HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION AND MADE SURE THAT THEY REMEMBER THINGS CORRECTLY.
