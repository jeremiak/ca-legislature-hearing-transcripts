THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THIRTY FIVE HE TARGETED AND APPROPRIATED EXPANSION OF THE UNDER UNDER UTILIZED EMPLOYMENT CREDIT PROGRAM FOR NBC SINCE COMING INTO WORK -- EXISTENCE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE N. N. E. C. HAS PROVIDED CERTAIN BUSINESSES WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO RECEIVE TAX CREDITS FOR MAKING NEW HIRES THAT MEET SPECIFIC WORK REQUIREMENTS IT PROVIDES THE INCENTIVE TO HIRE VETERANS PREVIOUS PREVIOUS INCARCERATED IN INDIVIDUALS PEOPLE WHO FACE HOUSING INSECURITY AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IT WAS IT WAS ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED THAT THE N. E. C. WOULD PROVIDE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN INSTEAD OF CREDITS ANNUALLY THE REALITY THAT NEVER HAS BEEN LESS THAN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WITH THIS IN MIND ALONG WITH THE NEEDS OF OF THE RESTAURANT OF THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND THE WEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC MY AB TWENTY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WOULD EXPAND THE NEC TO RESTAURANTS AND BARS TO PROVIDE NEEDED RELIEF FOR THIS STRUGGLING IN THIS INDUSTRY THIS HOSPITALITY SECTOR AMOUNTS TO NINE PERCENT OF THE STATE WORKFORCE BUT AN ESTIMATE OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND RESTAURANTS JOBS REMAINING UNFILLED FEWER THAN FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE RESTAURANT APPLICANTS WERE APPROVED FOR ASSISTANT FUNDING THROUGH THE RESTAURANT REVITALIZATION FUND AT EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THE INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS THAT DIDN'T RECEIVE FUNDING OUR APPARATUS FOR PERMANENT OR PERMANENTLY CLOSING MANY OF THESE RESTAURANTS STILL OPERATE AT HALF CAPACITY AS WE REBOUND WE REBOUND FOR THE PANDEMIC PROVIDING THIS UNEMPLOYMENT TAX CREDIT FOR RESTAURANTS AND BARS WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE THEIR HIRING WELL SIMULTANEOUS SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDING FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR THEIR HARD HIT INDUSTRY WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS CRAIG MISTER CRAIG ONE SISTER WHO REPRESENTS A NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS CRAIG HAS OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD OF TAXATION GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY -- YES I DO HAVE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD I WAS PREVIOUSLY A PARTNER AT ERNST AND YOUNG OUR PRINCIPAL OWN ATTORNEY WHERE I BROUGHT IN WHY WAS IN CHARGE OF THE INCENTIVES PRACTICE OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I BROUGHT FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THROUGH VARIOUS INCENTIVES PACKAGES IN THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS DO HELP AND THEY DO WORK -- WHEN I DID RETIRE I COMPANIES AND ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I FOCUSED ON WAS RESTAURANTS HOSPITALITY I ALSO HAPPEN TO HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN A BAR SO IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE STRUGGLES OF THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY -- SO WHAT I DO I USED BASED ON MY KNOWLEDGE OF THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS I THOUGHT WE COULD TWEAK THE NEC TO ALLOW RESTAURANTS AND BARS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM I THINK IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE POLICY REASON AT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE EXCLUDED -- WAS THE THOUGHT WAS THEY JUST DIDN'T NEED THE ASSISTANCE ANYWAY -- RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT THE RESTAURANTS AND THE IN GENERAL IS STRUGGLING -- WE AS AN AFFECT MY SMALL FIRM ALMOST PRO BONO ASSIST A LOT OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES JUST TO GET THROUGH -- HOPEFULLY THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS THE PROGRAM IS ONLY DESIGNED TO LAST ANOTHER THREE YEARS WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH THE TIME PERIOD I'VE I STE I SPECULATE THAT THESE RESTAURANTS AND BARS NEED TO HELP -- I DO FEEL IT WILL ENCOURAGE HIRING CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS THE PEOPLE I CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY BAR THESE ARE ACTUALLY GOOD JOBS -- SOME OF MY BARTENDERS THAT WORK WITH US TO MAKE OVER SIX FIGURES WORKED AT MY BAR FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND IT'S JUST THE REPRESENTED SAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF INDUSTRY SO I DO THINK IT'S A MEASURED APPROACH I THINK IT HAS SOME YOU KNOW AREAS WHERE IT CAN YOU JUST MAKE SURE IT'S NOT ABUSED -- IT THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY WHAT I MEANT BY THAT IS IS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S DESIGNED FOR CERTAIN PARTICULAR AREAS AREAS OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT IT'S NOT THE ENTIRE STATE IT'S DESIGNED FOR HIRING CERTAIN TYPES OF PEOPLE IT'S DESIGNED FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF WAGES AND IS DESIGNED TO TO -- AS WE WENT OVER IT LIKE CERTAIN CATEGORIES SO I JUST THINK IT IS A GOOD PROGRAM I THINK ADDING THE RESTAURANTS AND -- IN THE BARS TO THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM WOULD BE A GOOD FIT DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OUR RIGHTS WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN UP THE MAIN LINE FOR SUPPORTING TESTIMONY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN TO SHOW SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE THOUSAND HERE ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE AND WE HAVE NO ANSWER SUPPORT AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT AND WE HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT GOOD AFTERNOON KATIE HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WHERE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THIRTY FIVE ALL RIGHTS -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS ARE THERE ANY YEAH THANKS PRESTON YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE IN SUPPORT ALL RIGHT IS THERE ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AND CAN I HAVE A MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN UP THE MAIN LINE FOR ANY OPPOSITION TESTIMONY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN CHAU OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD NO THANK YOU AT THIS TIME RIGHT THANK YOU ARE THEIR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK HAHA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD -- MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT YOU'VE NOW SAID IN YOUR BILL THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO BE HIRED AT A HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT OF THE MINIMUM WAGE -- AND THAT WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THEY'RE BEING HIRED AT MINIMUM WAGE THEY CAN BE HIRED AT MINIMUM WAGE IS THAT CORRECT THE IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY WHAT WHAT'S INTERESTING ARE AND WHAT THE BARS IS AND RIGHTFULLY SO THE -- MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES IF I USE MY BARS AN EXAMPLE DO GET THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT THEN THEY GET A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN TIPS I DO BELIEVE THE -- AND THAT'S HOW THEY GET TO THE SIX FIGURE AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE THINKING LIKE LAUREN IT FOR THE -- THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY -- I ALSO DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S LIKE SIX OR SEVEN POLICY REASONS ON THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM -- IN ONE OF THEM IS LIKE HIRING A CERTAIN WAGE I DO FIND THOUGH THAT -- ONCE AGAIN IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY THERE ARE AVERAGE SALARIES WELL OVER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR FOR THE BARTENDER PERHAPS THE PEOPLE ARE THE -- THAT THE BARTENDERS AND THE -- YOU KNOW I GUESS IN THE CASE OF RESTAURANT THE WAITERS BUT YES WE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE WE CAN MAKE THAT TWEAK TO ACCOMMODATE THAT WELL BUT YOU STILL HAVE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE BACK DOING THE DISHES PREPARING THE MEALS SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD ONLY GET THE MINIMUM WAGE WHEN WE'RE SUBSIDIZING THEIR HIRING -- IS THERE A IS THERE SOMETHING YOU COULD SAY IT WOULD MAKE ME MORE COMFORTABLE YOU KNOW I WOULD WELL SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MANY OF THE RESTAURANTS I KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW THOUGH IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE COOKS AND THE NON THAT THE NON DIRECT STAFF THE WAGES HAVE ACTUALLY GONE UP -- THE THE PRIMARY DRIVER HERE IS IS THAT THE CREDIT STARTS REALLY THAT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS BEFORE THE CREDITS STARTED BEYOND HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT OF THE MINIMUM WAGE WHICH WAS TWENTY TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS AN HOUR THREE OUT AND SO DO SOME OF OUR BACK OFFICE PEOPLE ARE MAKING TWENTY BUCKS AN HOUR SO THE THOUGHT PROCESS ONCE AGAIN WOULD BE TO LOWER THAT SO THAT WE WOULD BE GETTING CREDIT FOR THOSE PEOPLE MAKING IN THAT KIND OF THAT WAGE RANGE RIGHT NOW WITH THE HAT MANY MANY PEOPLE IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY ARE PAYING THE MINIMUM WAGE SOME ARE LIKE THE YOU KNOW THE BACK OFFICE -- WELL I JUST GONNA SAY I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT THANK YOU RIGHT NOW ALL IF YOU LOOK AROUND MORE IS IS OF LATE LABOR CIRQUE SHORTAGE BUT I'D BE WILLING TO TO WORK WITH YOU CONSERVE OUR OUR -- OKAY YEAH I CAN UNDERSTAND FOR TIPPED EMPLOYEES -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND FOR OTHER STUFF THANK YOU THANK YOU SO -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I I HAD A QUESTION ALSO AND AND IT'S KIND OF ON WHAT THE ORIGINAL FOCUS THE THE YOU KNOW OF THE OF THIS PROGRAM WAS AND BARS ALREADY QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM RIGHT SO WHO BUT YOU KNOW WHICH BUSINESSES SPECIFICALLY ARE WE TRYING TO HELP THEN THE THE PRIMARY LIKE IF YOU GO ON THE MANY OF THEM HAVE LIKE THIRTY TO FORTY EMPLOYEES AND THEY'RE OVER THAT PARTICULAR RANGE OF THE QUOTE UNQUOTE IF YOU WANNA CALL IT SMALL I COULD TELL YOU LIKE MY BAR IS LIKE IN THAT YOU KNOW IT IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T MAKE MONEY THAT MUCH AND RECENTLY HAS MADE ANY MONEY BUT LIKE WHEN IT WAS AT ITS PEAK IT'S WELL OVER A COUPLE MILLION WHICH IS THE -- YOU'RE CONSIDERED SMALL BUT IT'S STILL IN IN WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND AND MANY OF THE -- I MEAN WE DO CONSIDER OURSELVES AS THIS PARTICULAR RESTAURANT AND WE HAVE PROBABLY LIKE A DOZEN CLIENTS THAT ARE ON THIS KIND OF SIMILAR BUCKET -- IN THE YOU KNOW WITH TWENTY TO THIRTY PEOPLE THEY'RE MAKING OVER THAT MINIMUM SO THAT'S WHY WE JUST THOUGHT MAYBE THAT WE COULD JUST -- ELIMINATE THAT CAP AND NOW ALSO WE ARE WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS UNLIKE IN THE RETAIL SPACE MANY OF THE OPERATORS THEY'RE NOT LIKE THE LARGE CHANGE THERE ARE SOME AND THEN AS A RETAIL SPACE I MEAN LIKE YOUR STORES AND SO THE ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO EXCLUDE LIKE YOUR YOUR BIG BOX RETAILERS AND PERHAPS LIKE YOUR LARGE RESTAURANTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR RESTAURANTS THOUGH IN CALIFORNIA ARE DOES THEY'RE NOT THAT THE BIG CHAINS BUT THEY DO GO BEYOND THAT LIMIT AND SO THIS LEGISLATION WAS JUST TRYING TO ACCOMMODATE THAT LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT GO BEYOND THAT SMALL AND BUT THE PROGRAM WAS TRYING TO THE PROGRAM I MEAN BASICALLY WANTED TO EXCLUDE RESTAURANTS EXCEPT SMALL RESTAURANTS AND RETAIL AND YOU'RE SAYING THE RESTAURANTS I GUESS HOW SHOULD BE INCLUDED THAT RETAIL STILL SHOULDN'T BE INCLUDED BECAUSE THE RESTAURANT JOBS PAY MORE IS THAT I MEAN IT IT'S IT'S WHAT WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS GOING SORT OF AGAINST WHAT THE ORIGINAL STATED POLICY GOALS OF WHAT I'M SAYING IS IS THAT THERE'S A LARGE GROUP THAT ARE CONSIDERED SMALL IN RESTAURANTS UNLIKE LIKE THE RETAIL SPACE WERE PROBABLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA IS FROM LARGE RETAILERS RESTAURANTS IT'S AN INTERESTING SPACE WHERE I GUESS WE CALL ON ANOTHER ICON MEDIUM SIZE RESTAURANTS IN MEDIUM SIZED BARS BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE BARS AND MY CLIENTS DO MAKE OVER THAT THRESHOLD THAT WAS PUT IN THE ORIGINAL LAW SO YES I'M SAYING TO MAKE AN ACCOMMODATION FOR THAT GROUP YES IS THERE ANY WAY TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH THE AVERAGE EMPLOYEE IS MAKING THEIR A CROSS SITE I MEAN I'D LIKE A MEDIUM SIZED RESTAURANT TO HAVE ANY OF THAT DATA AVAILABLE THE DATA I HAVE WELL YOU KNOW I WORK WITH THE C. R. A. ON THAT I CAN COME BACK WITH THAT RIGHT THAT WOULD BE GREAT OUR RIGHTS AT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHAT WE'RE WOULD YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH I JUST LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE LATER ON THIS MONTH ALL RIGHT I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND -- HOPE YOU ENJOY THE AFTERNOON IN THE DISTRICT WITH YOUR WOMAN OF THE YEAR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT

THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER GOVERNMENT IMPOSED MANDATE AND EXPENSE BORNE BY CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYERS HOWEVER AB EIGHTEEN NINETY IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE THE NEW MANDATE SINCE CALIFORNIA BELIEVES GOOD POLICY TO PROVIDE EXTENDED SICK LEAVE FOR COVERT NINETEEN INTO THE COMING YEAR IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD USE IT SURPLUS TO HELP PAY FOR THE ADDED NEW EXPENSE WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MANDATED COVE NINETEEN SICK LEAVE THEY UNDERSTOOD IT WAS A DIFFICULT EXPENSE FOR EMPLOYERS AND OFFERED A CORRESPONDING TAX CREDIT TO COVER THOSE COSTS CALCHAMBER PULLED NINE HUNDRED OF ITS MEMBERS MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED PREVIOUSLY SOUGHT FEDERAL TAX CREDITS TO OFFSET THE COSTS OF COVE IN NINETEEN SICK LEAVE THIS FEDERAL CREDITS HAVE NOW EXPIRED FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE POLLED BUSINESSES ARE

A. COUNTY ASSESSOR -- SUPPORTS THE BILL HERITAGE IS BUILT A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE UNITS TO THIS POINT IN L. A. COUNTY AND THEY SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE HERITAGE HAS A TWENTY YEAR TRACK RECORD OF DEVELOPING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS WITHIN THEIR TWENTY YEAR HISTORY HERITAGE HAS ALWAYS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME BOUGHT BACK THEIR HOUSING UNITS AFTER THE ORIGINAL FAMILY IS MOVED OUT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ANOTHER LOW INCOME FIRST TIME HOME BUYING FAMILY AND IN CLOSING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS EXEMPTION DOES NOT TAKE FUNDING AWAY FROM ANY STATE PROGRAM -- BECAUSE HERITAGE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG WE HAVE DATA FROM THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENTS SHOWING THAT WHILE THEY

REMIND THE COMMITTEE THE MEDIAN HOME PRICES IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOW REACHING THIS YEAR OVER EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THE MEDIAN HOME PRICE THANK GOODNESS I AM NOT TRYING TO ENTER THE MARKET AS A FIRST TIME HOME BUYER NOW IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO ABOUT HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CONTINUES TO TRY TO BUILD DEVELOP AND FINANCE AND REMIND THE COMMITTEE WERE ALSO UNDERWRITERS AND FINANCERS OF THESE MORTGAGES THAT TO BRING OUR FAMILIES INTO THE HOMES AND JUST IN SANDERS AND SAN MATTEO COUNTY ALONE WE RECENTLY HAD A TWENTY SIX UNIT PROJECT WITH OVER ONE THOUSAND APPLICATIONS TO THAT JUST TWENTY SIX UNITS IN SAN MATEO COUNTY AND BOTH REDWOOD CITY AND DALY CITY AND ANOTHER EIGHTY UNIT PROJECT IN MARIN COUNTY WAS JUST RECENTLY APPROVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL NEVADA JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE ALREADY HAVE FOUR HUNDRED INQUIRIES OF APPLICANTS TO GET INTO THOSE HOMES SO CLEARLY THERE IS NOT ENOUGH -- HOUSE AND HOUSES ON THE MARKET THAT THESE FAMILIES THAT ARE EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE LOWER THEIR DEMAND INCOME THAT HAVE A DESIRE AND A DREAM OF OWNING A HOME BUT IT'S JUST THEIR INCOME LEVEL THAT IS PROHIBITING THEM FROM BUYING A HOME BECAUSE I DOUBLE CHECKED THAT FIVE I'M TO ONE RATIO OF QUALIFIED APPLICANTS OF OF THOSE APPLICANTS IT'S FIVE TO ONE TO QUALIFY TO BUY A HOME WE JUST CAN'T BILL THEM AND GET ENOUGH OF THEM FAST ENOUGH AND HAVE IT HAS TO CONTINUE JUST LIKE HERITAGE HOME TO TRY TO FINANCE THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT THAT FAMILY CAN AFFORD IN THE MORTGAGE THAT WE'RE SPEAKING OF AND THE GAP TO ACTUALLY BUILD THE HOMES OF THIS PROPERTY TAX RELIEF HELPS BRING DOWN THE KIND OF THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION OVERALL AND JUST LIKE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID IT REALLY DOES GO BACK INTO HABITAT FOR HUMANITY TO HELP US BUILD MORE HOMES FOR OTHER FAMILIES SO WE'VE HAD A INVOLVED WITH THE TIME HABITAT MANY OF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE OLD MODEL AND IN SOME COUNTIES ARE STILL SING ONE FAMILY ONE HOUSE AT A TIME BUT LIKE YOU JUST HEARD WERE EVOLVING WITH THE TIMES AND HABITAT CAN'T UNDERWRITE EIGHTY UNITS A YEAR SO THEY ARE HAVING A PARTNER WITH SOME CONVENTIONAL LENDERS TO HELP UNDERWRITE THE LOANS THAT WE CAN BUILD MORE MORE HOMES OVER SO IN ORDER TO EVOLVE WITH THE TIMES WE NEED THAT STATUTE RELATED TO PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS TO ALSO EVOLVE WITH THE TIMES AND ALLOW FOR THIS CREATIVE FLEXIBILITY TO PARTNER WITH MIXED INCOME DEVELOPERS AS WELL AS MARKET CONVENTIONAL -- LENDERS TO HELP US SERVE MORE FAMILIES TO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I THOUGHT RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF IT DO WE HAS ANYBODY IN THE ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT THE MODERATOR IS ARE THERE

YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE CHAVEZ WHAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS HERE AT THE CLEANER WE WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND SPONSOR FOR ENGAGING ABOUT FOR DIALOGUE WITH DR AS IT RELATES TO OUR CONCERN WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSION WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND SPONSOR THEN ONCE AGAIN BUT JUST LIKE TO THANK THEM FOR ENGAGING WITH THE ARCH IN ORDER TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL AND AT THIS TIME AS ALL RIGHT NOBODY ELSE SIR ANYBODY IN THE ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ANYBODY IN THE SOMEBODY HAS SOMETHING TO SAY IS THERE ANYBODY ON THE LINE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION GENERALLY SPEAKING OPPOSITION PLEASE TERRACE LONDON ZERO AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO QUEUE AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION JUST A COMMENT XIN TO THE AUTHOR FOR THE BILL AND OUT OF BOX THINKING ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW TO HELP AND HOUSING ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE AND TRYING TO REDUCE THE COST WOULD HELP PEOPLE GET INTO HOMEOWNERSHIP AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE INNOVATIVE INKING IDEAS AND -- THE AUTHORS WORK I KNOW IN -- HER DISTRICT AND ALSO WITH THE HOUSING WORKING GROUP HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY SO THANK YOU FOR THIS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY I DID -- BUT I GUESS MAYBE FOR THE SPONSORS -- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HOUSING IS A HUGE ISSUE BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE -- WE'RE EXPANDING NOW THE -- WELFARE EXEMPTION TO COVER PROPERTY THAT'S BEING SOLD TO MODERATE INCOME HOMEOWNERS AND -- DO YOU THINK THIS MIGHT CREATE A PRECEDENT THAT WE WOULD BE SUBSIDIZING MODERATE INCOME HOUSING THROUGH THE TAX CODE AS OPPOSED TO -- FOCUSING ONLY ON TRULY AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE PRESIDENT IS KIND OF THE CONCERN WE HAVE IN THIS COMMITTEE I WOULD THERE IS SOME PRECEDENT -- THAT AGENCIES FORMALLY KNOWN AS REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES USED TO HAVE A BUDGET THAT WAS SET ASIDE FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOMES AND THOSE WERE DUE TO RESTRICTED AND HELP SUBSIDIZE AND SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS CONTINUE TO -- EXIST AND CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR MODERATE INCOME -- THE INTENSE TO LIVE IN THOSE HOMES ALSO I BELIEVE JUST LAST YEAR IN THE STATE BUDGET THERE WAS KELLY TO PAY WITH A NEW PROGRAM FOR MIXED INCOME THAT INCLUDED MODERATE INCOME THAT HAS A TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IS JUST FOR RENTAL -- SO HOMEOWNERSHIP DOESN'T HAVE SUCH EVEN AT LEAST THERE'S TWO PROGRAMS I'M AWARE OF THAT EVENT FOR RENTAL BUT AGAIN NONE FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP AND AND -- AND WENT AWAY THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY FROM BUT SPECIFICALLY FOR PRODUCTION OF -- HOMEOWNERSHIP AND AT I MEAN THERE IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE BEGINS WITH HER LOOKING AT LOW INCOME FOR A FOUR PERSON HOUSEHOLD AS OPPOSED TO MODERATE INCOME I MEAN YOU'RE WHAT WE WOULD BE WITH THE TAX CODE SUBSIDIZING PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE MAKING YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON THE AREA THAT YOU'RE IN THOUSAND IS IS THAT CORRECT MADAM YEAH MAN I'M SURE I MEAN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT COUNTY WERE TALKING ABOUT OBVIOUSLY WHAT THE ERROR IN THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME IS YOU KNOW OF OF THAT COUNTY YOU KNOW THAT AREA BUT AGAIN JUST WOULD LIKE TO STRESS THE COMMENTS THAT I MADE DURING MY EARLIER TESTIMONY IN THAT IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA FOR INSTANCE TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF CURRENT RENTERS HAVE AN INCOME OF OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND THERE IS THERE'S NO HOUSING STOCK FOR THEM TO MOVE INTO SECUELA THINK THERE'S AN ARGUMENT TO BE MADE FOR MODERATE INCOME AT IT BUT THE QUESTION IS DOES IT WITH THIS THIS -- WELFARE EXEMPTION ISN'T REALLY DESIGNATED FOR LOWER INCOME TRYING TO FIND HOUSING FOR SALE HISTORICALLY MEN I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE I MEAN THAT CAN I DECIDE -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND I I NEED TO LOOK MORE INTO THIS BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT SAME TAX CREDIT THOUGH IS USED FOR MODERATE INCOME RENTAL PROPERTY SO IT'S ALREADY BEING USED FOR THAT PURPOSE THIS WOULD JUST EXTEND IT FOR THAT THE -- FOR SALE PROPERTY AN ADDITION THE NUMBERS REALLY HAVEN'T KEPT UP WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE HOUSING MARKET SO IF THE INTENT REALLY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE SOMEWHERE -- IT STILL SERVES THE SAME PURPOSE AND -- AND BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY ONLY THE TAX RELIEF DURING THE PERIOD FROM THE PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY THROUGH CONSTRUCTION IT'S NOT INPUT TO THE ONES THAT WITHOUT PROPERTIES PURCHASED IT'S NO LONGER IT THEN THEY START PAYING TAXES ON IT SO IT'S REALLY A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME TO HELP THOSE DEVELOPERS GET THE PROJECTS ON THE GROUND I DO WANNA REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT THE HOMEOWNERS REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME LEVEL DO YOU HAVE TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES IT'S REASSESSED AT THE POINT THAT THEY TAKE OVER THAT THEY GET A PROPERTY TAX BILL I'D LIKE RENTAL UNITS WILL REMAIN EXEMPT FOR THE LIFE OF THE PROPERTY I I -- DEFINITELY APPRECIATE ALL THOSE ARGUMENTS AND -- WE WILL BE WORKING WITH WITH YOU ON ON THE BILL ITSELF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR HELP WITH THE BILL THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTRESS APPS ALL RIGHTS THIS RUBIO I BELIEVE YOU ARE YES ITEM NUMBER SIX AB TWENTY SIXTY FIVE WHENEVER YOU ARE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIXTY FIVE AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WOULD PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES WE'RE ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS YOU HAVE TO BE MADE AT THE ONSET OF COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN TWENTY TWENTY FACED WITH AN UNCERTAIN BUDGET OUTLOOK AND THEN EVEN LESS CERTAIN ECONOMIC FUTURE SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE CHANGES WERE MADE TO STABILIZE AND PREPARE THE STATE FOR WHAT WAS A POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING REVENUE HIT TO OUR PROGRAMS AMONG THE MANY STEPS TAKEN WITH THE SUSPENSION OF NET OPERATING LOSSES OR AND -- AL'S WHICH PRESERVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE STATE TO SAFEGUARD OUR ESSENTIAL PROGRAMS AND ALSO PROVIDE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES TO RECOUP CAPITAL WHEN FUTURE OPERATIONS BECOME PROFITABLE AND ALLOW LONG TERM BOLD INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND BUSINESS S. AS IN CALIFORNIA FORTUNATELY FOR THE STATE OUR ECONOMIC THERE ARE ECONOMY PROVED FAR MORE RESILIENT THAN EXPECTED AND REVENUE REMAINS STRONG UNFORTUNATELY THE US THAT SUSPENSION OF AN ALLS LEVIED A BLOW TO MANY CALIFORNIA COMPANIES THAT WERE LEFT WITHOUT THE CRITICAL FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY FLEXIBILITY AND ALL WOULD HAVE PROVIDED THEM WHILE THE GOVERNOR HAS SIGNED SB ONE THIRTEEN WHICH ENDS THE NO ALSO SUSPENSION FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO CALIFORNIA COMPANIES IMPACTED BY AND ALL SUSPENSION IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE ARE STILL LEFT WITHOUT ANY RELIEF AB TWENTY SIXTY FIVE WOULD PROVIDE THAT RELIEF TO SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THE COMPANIES SIMPLY PUT THIS BILL WOULD GIVE RECORDS FOR COMPANIES THAT HAD SIGNIFICANT REVENUE EVENTS ALLOWING A ONE TIME KERRY BACK FOR THAT YEARS I KNOW AL WAS SUSPENDED WELL THIS BILL WILL NOT COVER EVERY ENTITY THAT WAS IMPACTED BY THE SUSPENSION OF THE AND I'LL CREDIT IT WILL PROVIDE AN AVENUE FOR THOSE WITH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AT AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THE STATE IS HERE TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S INVESTED RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS TIME SHE AND GREG TURNER ON BEHALF OF CARDINAL ENERGY THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER TURNER'S BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO YIELD ONE MINUTE OF THIS TIME SO IF I GO SLIGHTLY OVER FOR KEEPING TRACK MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE REVENUE AND TAXATION COMMITTEE I AM TOM SHE AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENT CARRILLO ENERGY AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS AFTERNOON WE ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA OF TAX FAIRNESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT A NET OPERATING LOSS OR AS WE SAY AND -- WELL OCCURS WHEN THE BUSINESSES EXPENSES EXCEEDS ITS TAXABLE INCOME IN A GIVEN PERIOD AND THEY CAN THEN BE CARRIED FORWARD TO OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IN ORDER TO REDUCE FUTURE TAX LIABILITY NO WELLS HELP SMOOTH OUT THE INCOME AND TAXES PAID OVER A BUSINESS CYCLE AND THIS ALLOWS BUSINESSES TO MAKE EFFICIENT DECISIONS REGARDING FINANCING AND THEIR INVESTMENTS THIS TAX POLICY IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO BUSINESS INVESTMENTS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT A COMPANY MAY BE MORE WILLING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN MACHINERY AND PEOPLE KNOWING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE MONEY ON THE FRONT END WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY CAN CARRY THOSE LOSSES FORWARD AND ON THE BACK AND RECOUP SOME OF THAT CAPITAL THANK YOUS THOSE INVESTMENTS COMPANIES THAT OPERATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE THE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE TAX RULES ARE GOING TO BE WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THOSE TYPES OF MULTI YEAR INVESTMENT DECISIONS WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO BROTHER COMPANY AND GROW THE ECONOMY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THERE'S UNCERTAINTY OVER STATE TAX POLICY OVER HOW TAXES WILL BE CALCULATED AND LEVY THIS TO TURNER'S DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS IN OUR STATE THAT HURTS CALIFORNIA THAT COST US JOBS IN THE COST OF FUTURE TAX REVENUE THE DECISION BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO SUSPEND THE OTHER WELL FOR THREE YEARS -- BECAUSE OF THE COVERT NINETEEN EMERGENCY ABSOLUTELY MADE SENSE AT THE TIME HOWEVER AS IT IS TURNED OUT WE NOW KNOW THAT THE SUSPENSIONS WERE ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY IN FACT OVER THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS ACCORDING TO THE NONPARTISAN LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THERE HAVE BEEN GENERAL FUND SURPLUSES EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS AND THERE ARE RECORD SURPLUSES THAT ARE EXPECTED AGAIN THIS YEAR ALL RIGHT NOW I THINK THE ESTIMATE IS FORTY FIVE BILLION AND COUNTING MY CLIENT LIKE MANY OTHER CALIFORNIA COMPANIES WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO PROVIDE A GENERAL FUND ZERO INTEREST LOAN FOR THREE YEARS UNDER THE BELIEF THAT THE STATE NEEDED THE FUNDS AND WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT AT SOME POINT THEY COULD ACTUALLY RECOUP THESE TAX BENEFITS IN THE FUTURE BUT WE KNOW NOW THAT THE NFL SUSPENSION WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR COMPANIES LIKE MY CLIENT AND FOR OTHERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO RECOUP THE INVESTMENTS THEY MADE AS A RESULT OF THE SENATE WILL SUSPENSIONS SB ONE THIRTEEN ENACTED EARLIER THIS YEAR REMOVES THE END OF ALL SUSPENSION FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO FISCAL ARCHITECTURE BUT WE NEED ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO'S BILL IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TAX YEARS WE BELIEVE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS WHO MADE ZERO INTEREST LOANS TO THE STATE GENERAL FUND AS A RESULT OF AB EIGHTY FIVE THE TRAILER BILL THAT SET THIS UP WITH AS WE BELIEVE THAT THEY DESERVE TO BE MADE WHOLE NOW THE CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED UNPRECEDENTED GENERAL FUND SURPLUSES OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS MAKING THE ORIGINAL NEED FOR THE SUSPENSION POINTLESS FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT AB TWENTY SIXTY FIVE WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WHEN
