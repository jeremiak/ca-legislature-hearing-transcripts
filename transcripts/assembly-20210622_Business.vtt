00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:49.580
HAVE TO REMEMBER ABOUT THE

00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:51.883
HOMEOWNER NOW THEY ALSO HAVE

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:56.521
THE OPTION TO EITHER HIRE THAT

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:58.823
PARTICULAR- PLUMBER FROM THAT.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.559
COMPANY OR THEY CAN GO OUTSIDE

00:36:01.626 --> 00:36:03.594
CALL WHOMEVER THEY WISH BUT THE

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:05.763
BOTTOM LINE IS THE COUNTY OR

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.932
THE CITY WHO REQUIRES IT STILL

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:09.767
HAS TO HAVE IT CERTIFIED BY A

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:11.969
LICENSED PLUMBER. THERE'S THE

00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:14.672
ISSUES RIGHT THERE. I THINK IF

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:16.774
I IF I AM MAY I THINK THE WORK

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:19.410
THAT. IS DONE HAS TO BE DONE

00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:22.480
BASED ON A STATE LAW HAS TO BE

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:24.715
DONE BY A LICENSED CONTRACTOR

00:36:24.782 --> 00:36:25.650
FOR INSTANCE ONE OF YOUR

00:36:25.716 --> 00:36:27.752
WITNESSES. ARE THEY A HOME

00:36:27.818 --> 00:36:28.986
INSPECTION GROUP THAT ACTUALLY

00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:32.356
HOLDS A LOT OF RUMORS LICENSE

00:36:32.423 --> 00:36:34.458
SO THAT THEY CAN. INSPECT THE

00:36:34.525 --> 00:36:36.093
HOME AND THEN TURN AROUND AND

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.995
ACTUALLY DO THE WORK AS A

00:36:38.062 --> 00:36:39.263
LICENSE CONTRACT WITH THE STATE

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.865
OF CALIFORNIA WELL THAT'S WHAT

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:42.700
THE LAW WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO

00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:44.402
SO THE UMBRELLA COMPANY THE

00:36:44.468 --> 00:36:46.437
HOME INSPECTION COMPANY. WILL

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:49.574
NOW EMPLOYS LICENSE CONTRACTORS

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.876
THEY CAN USE THEM- TO GO AHEAD

00:36:51.943 --> 00:36:54.278
AND DO THE WORK. AND AS STANDS

00:36:54.345 --> 00:36:56.380
RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T BECAUSE IF

00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:57.982
THEY DID THE INSPECTION THEY

00:36:58.049 --> 00:36:59.517
CAN'T DO THE WORK IF THEY DID

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:00.851
OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS SO

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:03.054
THIS CLARIFIES IT IT IT MAKES

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:03.988
IT MUCH BETTER FOR THE

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:06.958
HOMEOWNER. HI MAKE AND RECEIVE-

00:37:07.024 --> 00:37:07.825
THE SERVICE THEY DESERVE

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:09.961
SENATOR I APPRECIATE THAT BUT I

00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:11.195
THINK THAT WAS THE INTENT OF

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:13.831
THE ORIGINAL. LAW THAT DROVE-

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:16.367
THAT DREW A LINE BETWEEN THE

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:18.536
HOME INSPECTION AN INSPECTOR

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:19.637
AND A CONTRACTOR NOW WE'RE

00:37:19.704 --> 00:37:21.973
HIRING CONTRACTORS TO WORK FOR

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:23.874
THAT HOME INSPECTOR. AND SO

00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:25.309
THAT CONTRACTORS SIMPLY GONNA

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:27.378
FOLLOW FALL FALL IN LINE WITH

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:28.679
WHAT THAT HOME INSPECTOR SAYS

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:29.814
RATHER THAN THERE BEING A

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.183
CHECKS AND BALANCE TYPE SYSTEM

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.851

HOME INSPECTORS OR WHETHER IT'S

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:45.329
MAKING UP A CLEAR DEFINITION.

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:46.464

RESPECT TO SOMEONE WHO IS

01:45:07.834 --> 01:45:10.170
INDIGENT. LET'S JUST LET'S JUST

01:45:10.237 --> 01:45:11.705
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE AN UNLAWFUL

01:45:11.772 --> 01:45:14.074
DETAINER ACTION. AND UNLAWFUL

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:15.842
DETAINER ACTION IF YOU ARE

01:45:15.909 --> 01:45:20.313
BEING- POTENTIALLY EVICTED AND

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:23.750
FOR EXAMPLE- YOU OR- YOUR

01:45:23.817 --> 01:45:24.785
OPPONENT WISHES TO HAVE A

01:45:24.851 --> 01:45:26.653
CONTINUANCE YOU CAN GO TO COURT

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.455
THERE IS NOTHING HERE THAT

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:30.090
PREVENTS YOU FROM GOING TO THE

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:32.192
COURTHOUSE. WHAT IT DOES DO

01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:34.728
THOUGH IS FOR A HEARING THAT

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:36.530
WILL PROBABLY LAST LESS THAN

01:45:36.596 --> 01:45:38.532
THREE MINUTES YOU CAN DO SO

01:45:38.598 --> 01:45:39.533
FROM YOUR HOME IF YOU HAVE

01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:41.601
CONNECTIVITY OR FROM A LIBRARY

01:45:41.668 --> 01:45:44.004
IF YOU HAVE CONNECTIVE ITTY. OR

01:45:44.071 --> 01:45:46.073
FROM LEGAL AID OFFICE. OR YOU

01:45:46.139 --> 01:45:48.709
CAN WAIT FOR A DAY AND GO TO

01:45:48.775 --> 01:45:50.277
COURT MISS A DAY OF WORK. AND

01:45:50.343 --> 01:45:52.979
DO THAT. WHAT THIS DOES IS IT

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:55.415
IT SIMPLY CREATES EFFICIENCIES

01:45:55.482 --> 01:45:57.951
AND IT IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL TO

01:45:58.018 --> 01:45:59.686
THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO MISS A

01:45:59.753 --> 01:46:01.621
DAY OF WORK TO THOSE WHO CAN'T

01:46:01.688 --> 01:46:02.723
MISS A DAY WORK SO THAT THEY

01:46:02.789 --> 01:46:04.191
CAN PARTICIPATE REMOTELY. IT

01:46:04.257 --> 01:46:06.026
ALSO CUTS DOWN IF YOU ARE A

01:46:06.093 --> 01:46:08.462
LITIGANT IF YOU ARE A LITIGANT

01:46:08.528 --> 01:46:09.930
AND YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT NEEDS

01:46:09.996 --> 01:46:11.898
TO IDENTIFY RECORDS YOU CAN

01:46:11.965 --> 01:46:14.301
EITHER. HAVE THEM COME IN HANG

01:46:14.367 --> 01:46:16.503
AROUND FOR A DAY OR YOU CAN

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:18.405
HAVE THEM TESTIFY REMOTELY.

01:46:18.472 --> 01:46:20.273
IT'S VERY SIMPLE WE HAVE BEEN

01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.709
DOING REMOTE TESTIMONY COURT

01:46:22.776 --> 01:46:24.377
CALL FOR THIRTY YEARS HERE IN

01:46:24.444 --> 01:46:26.713
CALIFORNIA. I REALIZE THAT

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:27.781
THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:30.350
TECHNOLOGY ENCROACHING ON COURT

01:46:30.417 --> 01:46:32.719
REPORTERS RESPONSIBILITIES. OUT

WE WILL DO WHATEVER IS

01:46:33.553 --> 01:46:34.788
NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT IS

01:46:34.855 --> 01:46:36.890
CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT A COURT

01:46:36.957 --> 01:46:38.358
REPORTER HAS TO BE IN THE

01:46:38.425 --> 01:46:40.127
COURTROOM. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU

01:46:40.193 --> 01:46:41.161
WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN COURT

01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:42.929
PROCEEDINGS YOU KNOW COURT

01:46:42.996 --> 01:46:44.931
REPORTER SIMPLY RAISES HIS OR

01:46:44.998 --> 01:46:47.200
HER HAND. AND THE JUDGE WAS

01:46:47.267 --> 01:46:48.468
ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

01:46:48.535 --> 01:46:50.570
RECORD STOPS THE PROCEEDINGS

01:46:50.637 --> 01:46:52.139
AND SAYS TO THE WITNESS I'M

01:46:52.205 --> 01:46:53.073
SORRY YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:54.241
REPEAT YOUR ANSWER FOR YOU

01:46:54.307 --> 01:46:56.276
CAN'T SPEAK ON TOP ONE OF. THE

01:46:56.343 --> 01:46:57.611
SAME IS TRUE IN A REMOTE

01:46:57.677 --> 01:46:59.112
HEARING COURT REPORTER COULD DO

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:01.014
EXACTLY THE SAME THING SO I

DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS YOUR

01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:05.752
QUESTION BUT- I THINK THAT THIS

01:47:05.819 --> 01:47:07.654
ISSUE IS ONE THAT- WILL

01:47:07.721 --> 01:47:09.589

LOT OVER THE LAST TWENTY MONTHS

01:48:46.553 --> 01:48:48.088
ABOUT EFFICIENCY THERE'S A LOT

01:48:48.154 --> 01:48:49.723
OF THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE

01:48:49.789 --> 01:48:51.625
ELECTRONICALLY VIA ZOOM OUR

01:48:51.691 --> 01:48:53.326

WORKED WHAT HASN'T WORKED. A

01:48:57.697 --> 01:49:00.300
BUT UNLESS WE TAKE SOME STEPS

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:01.268
TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY IN

01:49:01.334 --> 01:49:03.270
THE SYSTEM. YEAH THERE'S

01:49:03.336 --> 01:49:04.571
ANOTHER SIDE OF THAT IMPACT

01:49:04.638 --> 01:49:06.072
IT'S THE PETITIONS FOR

01:49:06.139 --> 01:49:07.307
EXPUNGING CRIMINAL RECORDS ARE

01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:09.042
GETTING HURT IT'S THE UNLAWFUL

01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:10.377
DETAINER ACTIONS ARE GETTING

01:49:10.443 --> 01:49:12.746
HURT IT'S I MEAN YOU NAME IT AT

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:14.114
THIS POINT IN TIME RIGHT NOW AT

01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:16.182
LEAST IN MY COUNTY OR THE TWO

01:49:16.249 --> 01:49:17.450
COUNTIES I PRACTICE IN. THE

01:49:17.517 --> 01:49:19.319
ONLY TRIAL YOU CAN EVEN GET ON

01:49:19.386 --> 01:49:21.922
A CALENDAR. IS A CRIMINAL TRIAL

01:49:21.988 --> 01:49:24.491
WITHOUT A TIME WITH. ANYTHING

01:49:24.557 --> 01:49:26.593
ELSE YOU'RE BEING PUT OUT.

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:29.062
MONTHS IF NOT YEARS. WE HAVE A

01:49:29.129 --> 01:49:30.430
SYSTEM WHERE WE WANT TO RESOLVE

01:49:30.497 --> 01:49:32.198
DISPUTES AND SETTLE ISSUES AND

01:49:32.265 --> 01:49:34.334
WE'VE GOT TO DO IT EFFICIENTLY.

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:36.803
AND IF WE DON'T. THE INJUSTICE

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:38.705
FALLS HARDEST ON THE PEOPLE

01:49:38.772 --> 01:49:40.106
THAT ARE THE LEAST ABLE TO

01:49:40.173 --> 01:49:41.574
PROTECT THEMSELVES. BY HIRING

01:49:41.641 --> 01:49:42.909
EXPENSIVE LAWYERS TO MAKE THE

01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:44.311
SYSTEM WORK FOR THEM. IF THEY

01:49:44.377 --> 01:49:45.979
CAN EVEN MAKE THEM WORK. IF

01:49:46.046 --> 01:49:47.013
THEY CAN EVEN MAKE THE SYSTEM

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:48.982
WORK. SO I JUST WANT TO OFFER

01:49:49.049 --> 01:49:51.718
THAT PERSPECTIVE THE IMPACT ON

01:49:51.785 --> 01:49:53.053
OUR COURT SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IS

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:54.955
REAL. THE DELAY. THAT

01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:57.223
EVERYBODY'S FACING ISRAEL. AND

01:49:57.290 --> 01:49:59.159
I'VE I THINK THIS MEASURE WILL

01:49:59.225 --> 01:50:00.593
WILL DO SOMETHING TO HELP

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:01.861
ALLEVIATE THAT AND MOVE TOWARDS

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:03.763
A LITTLE BIT MORE EFFICIENCY.

01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:05.398
AND I THINK THAT THE ISSUE WITH

01:50:05.465 --> 01:50:06.466
THE COURT REPORTER I THINK

01:50:06.533 --> 01:50:08.068
WE'VE HEARD IS COMMITMENT. TO

01:50:08.134 --> 01:50:09.502
WORKING THAT OUT OVER TIME AND

01:50:09.569 --> 01:50:11.171
I THINK THAT THAT CAN BE DONE.

01:50:11.237 --> 01:50:13.506
AND YES THE SAME PROCESS CAN

01:50:13.573 --> 01:50:16.876
BE. EMPLOYED AND HIM. HE

01:50:16.943 --> 01:50:17.544
ANSWERED THE QUESTION THAT'S AN

01:50:17.610 --> 01:50:19.245
IMPORTANT POINT. NOBODY IS

01:50:19.312 --> 01:50:20.847
BEING FORCED TO DO ELECTRONIC

01:50:20.914 --> 01:50:22.649
THINGS YOU CAN STILL ORDER THIS

01:50:22.716 --> 01:50:24.017
BILL IF NOT CORRECT ME IF I'M

01:50:24.084 --> 01:50:25.618
WRONG. YOU CAN STILL COME INTO

01:50:25.685 --> 01:50:27.554
COURT. IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE TO

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.389
DOWNTOWN LA FROM HER YOU HAVE

01:50:29.456 --> 01:50:30.690
FOR WHEREVER YOUR- YOUR THINGS

01:50:30.757 --> 01:50:31.925
VENUE DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT

01:50:31.992 --> 01:50:32.759
OPTION SO I THINK THAT'S

01:50:32.826 --> 01:50:34.327
IMPORTANT. HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:36.429
MEASURE. I HOPE IT PASSES

01:50:36.496 --> 01:50:40.200
BECAUSE WE. WE DEFINITELY NEED

01:50:40.266 --> 01:50:41.167
SOME HELP IN THE COURT SYSTEM.

01:50:41.234 --> 01:50:42.469

THE- CLOGGING OF OUR COURTS.

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:56.716
ABOUT IT BUT I THINK- ONE ISSUE

01:50:56.783 --> 01:50:58.818
ON THAT WOULD BE- MORE JUDGES.

01:50:58.885 --> 01:51:01.721
ESPECIALLY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY.

01:51:01.788 --> 01:51:02.889
AND I SHARE THE CONCERN THAT I

01:51:02.956 --> 01:51:04.691
HEARD. FROM ONE OF MY

01:51:04.758 --> 01:51:07.327
COLLEAGUES FROM LA HERE. ON

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:09.562
I'LL JUST THE INEFFICIENCY. OF

01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:11.698
THE TECHNOLOGY. THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:51:11.765 --> 01:51:14.000
IT HERE. OF FIRST HAND ON THIS

01:51:14.067 --> 01:51:17.737
FLOOR- IN IN OUR HEARINGS WERE.

01:51:17.804 --> 01:51:20.774
THINGS GO OUT- AS AN EDUCATOR.

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.542
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW

01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:24.611
DIFFICULT IT HAD BEEN FOR

01:51:24.677 --> 01:51:27.113
STUDENTS ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:29.582
STUDENTS A TO DO DISTANCE

01:51:29.649 --> 01:51:31.885
LEARNING AND THE FAILURE. OF

01:51:31.951 --> 01:51:34.587
THE TECHNOLOGY SO WHEN I HEARD

01:51:34.654 --> 01:51:37.157
COURT REPORTERS SAYING. THE DAY

01:51:37.223 --> 01:51:40.360

YOUR RESPONSE TO THE COURT

01:51:51.004 --> 01:51:53.339
REPORTERS WHO SAY THAT THAT

01:51:53.406 --> 01:51:55.141
IT'S A FAILURE OF TECHNOLOGY
