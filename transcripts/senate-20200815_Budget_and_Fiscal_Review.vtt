00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:22.808
ACTUAL EXPENDITURES SO THE-

00:22:22.874 --> 00:22:23.875
PATIENT THAT'S REALLY SORT OF

00:22:23.942 --> 00:22:25.477
YOUR FRONTEND ACCOUNTABILITY OF

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:26.945
HOW HIS ADMINISTRATION EXPECT

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:30.148
TO USE THE SIGNS. UP REPORTING

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:31.983
ON THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURES IS

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.118
SORT OF MORE OF A BACK IN

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:35.220
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT LACKS THE

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:37.489
LEGISLATURE- NO HEALTH PLANS

00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:39.057
ARE ACTUALLY BEING SPENT AND

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:40.926
THE PACE OF THERE BEING SACKED-

00:22:40.992 --> 00:22:42.427
AND WHETHER THAT ALIGNS WITH

00:22:42.494 --> 00:22:45.797
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION. HAD

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:46.932
INDICATED OR ITS PLANS. I'M SO

00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:48.166
A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:50.402
YOU COULD- REQUEST OR REQUIRE

00:22:50.469 --> 00:22:52.938
THE ADMINISTRATION TO. REPORTS

00:22:53.004 --> 00:22:54.873
ON ACTUAL EXPENDITURES THE

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.508
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER AS

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:58.510
SOME SORT OF- ROUTINE REPORTING

00:22:58.577 --> 00:22:59.978
SUCH AS MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:02.781
EXPENDITURE REPORTS- EVEN KNOWS

00:23:02.848 --> 00:23:03.915
THAT SINCE EARLY APRIL THE

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:04.983
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.651
REQUIRED ALL STATE AGENCIES TO

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:08.019
REPORT ON THEIR CLOTHING

00:23:08.086 --> 00:23:09.354
NINETEEN RELATED COSTS. AND SO

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:10.989
THEY'RE COLLECTING A LOT OF

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.858
THIS INFORMATION ALREADY AND SO

00:23:12.924 --> 00:23:14.659
IT IT DOESN'T SEEM UNREASONABLE

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:16.661
TO REQUEST THAT THEY SHARE A

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:18.597
SUMMARY OF THAT INFORMATION

00:23:18.663 --> 00:23:20.532
THAT THEY COLLECT ALREADY WITH

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:22.267
THE LEGISLATURE. I'M AND WE

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:23.668
WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THESE-

00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:25.070
EXPENDITURE RECORDS COULD BE

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:27.539
COMBINED WITH REPORTING ON THE

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:28.807
PLAN ALLOCATION OF FUNDS AS

00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:30.842
WELL SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:32.711
GETTING A COMPLETE PICTURE. I'M

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:34.346
ANOTHER APPROACH IF YOU DIDN'T

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:35.881
WANT TO HAVE MONTHLY OR

00:23:35.947 --> 00:23:37.349
QUARTERLY EXPENDITURE REPORTS.

00:23:37.415 --> 00:23:38.617
ON YOU COULD HAVE MAYBE A LESS

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:40.285
FREQUENT REPORTING SUCH AS

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:41.987
HAVING TRIGGERING A REPORT

00:23:42.053 --> 00:23:43.789
EVERY TEN ADMINISTRATION HITS A

00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:45.557
CERTAIN THRESHOLD AT THAT LEVEL

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:46.792
OF FUNDS SPENT SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:23:46.858 --> 00:23:48.226
WHEN THEY SPENT TWENTY FIVE OR

00:23:48.293 --> 00:23:53.298
FIFTY OR SEVENTY FIVE. PERCENT

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:56.368
OF THE FUNDS. REPORTING OPTIONS

00:23:56.434 --> 00:23:57.435
THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WE THINK

00:23:57.502 --> 00:23:59.271
COULD HELP FACILITATE IMPROVED

00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:00.872
INFORMATION NEEDED FOR

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:01.406
OVERSIGHT OF THE RECENTLY

00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:04.943
PROVIDED. CO IN NINETEEN. NOW

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.812
WELL IT'S NOT DIRECTLY RELATED

00:24:06.878 --> 00:24:07.612
TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THESE

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:09.314
RECENTLY PROVIDED FRIENDS WE

00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:10.816
WANT TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:12.217
WITH YOU. THAT WE FEEL IS ALSO

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:13.485
AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT HAS

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:14.986
COME TO OUR ATTENTION DURING

00:24:15.053 --> 00:24:16.822
OUR REVIEW OF NOT ONLY THE

00:24:16.888 --> 00:24:18.523
COPING NINETEEN EMERGENCY

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.958

MAJOR WILDFIRES AND CIVIL

00:24:26.464 --> 00:24:27.799
DISTURBANCE ISSUES. FROM

SPECIFICALLY IT'S CONTRARY

00:24:29.034 --> 00:24:31.670
TENSION THAT THE STATE HAS I'M

00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:33.772
NUMEROUS AN OVERLAPPING

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:35.841
EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES

00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:38.310
THIS IS THROUGH THE- EMERGENCY

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:39.911
SERVICES ACTING AS WELL AS

00:24:39.978 --> 00:24:41.980
STREAMLINED TIME AND DIFFERENT

00:24:42.047 --> 00:24:44.082
BUDGET PROCESS SEES. THESE VERY

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:45.317
EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES

00:24:45.383 --> 00:24:46.484
APPEAR TO CREATE DIFFERENT

00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:48.153
MECHANISMS OF SPENDING

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.855
AUTHORITY THAT COULD ALLOW. FOR

00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:51.489
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT LEVELS

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:53.391
OF TRANSPARENCY AND LEGISLATIVE

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:55.527
OVERSIGHT DEPENDING ON THE

00:24:55.594 --> 00:24:57.529
DISASTER AND THE AUTHORITY THAT

00:24:57.596 --> 00:24:59.264
DIMINISHING IN MINISTRATION SHE

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:03.735
JUST YEARS IN ANY. GIVEN

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:04.970
PARTICULAR EMERGENCY. ARMENIANS

00:25:05.036 --> 00:25:05.937

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:08.206
LAW FOR DECADES AND SOME OF

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:10.275
THEM HAVE BEEN RARELY USE. SO

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:11.543
THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:12.644
CONSIDER JUST LOOKING TOWARDS

00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:15.146
THE FUTURE- TO CONSIDER IN

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.655
LONGER TERM CHANGES. TO HELP

COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE- BY IN

00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:41.192
TERMS AS- I THINK WHAT WE'RE

00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:41.993
TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT IN OUR

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.928
PRESENTATION IS THE FLEXIBILITY

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:45.163
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.098
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS. IN

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:48.233
DETERMINING HOW TO ALLOCATE

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:50.435
FUNDS TO DEPARTMENTS- AND

00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:52.203
REALLY AUTHORIZED DEPARTMENTS

THEY NEED MAYBE PURSUING OKAY

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:01.079
THE REASON I ASK IS I COME FROM

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:02.781
A COUNTY MODEL WHERE AN AUDITOR

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:04.449

THE CONTROLLER MENTIONED ONCE

IN YOUR REPORT AND I'M JUST

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:18.496
WONDERING. IF ISSUE. JUST

00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:19.064

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:25.570
THE CONTROLLER PROVIDING US. A

pKNOW RISK YOU HAVE TO FIGURE

00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:36.548
OUT IF AN AUDIT FIRM COMES IN

00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:39.184

INFORMATION ON THEIR INTERNAL

00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:49.060
PROCESS THESE- BUT I THINK THE

00:28:49.127 --> 00:28:49.994
POINT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:28:50.061 --> 00:28:51.996
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT EXISTING

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:55.767
STATE LAW AS WELL AS THAT. AND

FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED IN THE

00:28:57.802 --> 00:28:59.537
BUDGET ALLOWS THE

00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:01.439
ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE A LOT OF

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:03.274
THESE DECISIONS AROUND HOW TO

00:29:03.341 --> 00:29:07.045

ADMINISTRATION CAN EFFECT OF

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.091
THROUGH THE AUTHORITIES THAT WE

00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:08.760

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:34.746

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:42.186
OF INFORMATION. THAT'S A GOOD

00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:45.656
QUESTION SO V. THERE THERE'S

00:33:45.723 --> 00:33:46.657
DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:48.192
DEPENDING ON THE SOURCE OF THE

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:51.662
FUNDING AND I TOUCHED ON A

00:33:51.729 --> 00:33:52.263
LITTLE BIT IN THE BEGINNING OF

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.498
OUR PRESENT TO BUT GENERAL

00:33:53.564 --> 00:33:55.733
SPEAKING MOST OF THESE FUNDS

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.702
ARE PROVIDED IN A VERY FLEXIBLE

00:33:57.769 --> 00:34:00.304
MANNER THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE ON

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:02.407
ANY SORT OF REPORTING BACK TO

00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:04.642
THE LEGISLATURE. I HAVE A LOT

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:05.676
OF THE FUNDS WERE PROVIDED

00:34:05.743 --> 00:34:07.612
THROUGH THREE ELAT AND AS I

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:09.981
NOTED- THE INITIATION IS

00:34:10.047 --> 00:34:12.984
REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THEIR GLVC

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.352
WHEN MONEY IS TRANSFERRED INTO

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:15.920
THE THREE- AND THEY WOULD

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:18.322
IDENTIFY YOUR BROADLY AND THE

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.124
TYPES OF THE REASON FOR THAT

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:21.726
DAY TRANSFER IN THE TYPES OF

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:23.327
THINGS FUNDED. BUT THERE'S NO

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:25.163
REQUIREMENT TO NOTIFY THE

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.731
LEGISLATURE ASSETS FUNDS

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:27.832
ACTUALLY GO OUT THE DOOR OR

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.200
ALLOCATED DEPARTMENT

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:31.969
DEPARTMENTS- AND SO A LOT OF

00:34:32.036 --> 00:34:32.703
THE MONEY HAS BEEN PROVIDED

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:34.939
THROUGH JURY OUT WHILE ON THE

00:34:35.006 --> 00:34:36.007
FUNDS THAT WERE PROVIDED

00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:37.742
THROUGH SECTION THIRTY SIX DID

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:38.976
HAVE A SEVENTY TWO HOUR

00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:41.979
NOTIFICATION- THAT WAS IN LAST

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:43.247
WAS TO FISCAL YEAR THE-

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:45.116
ADMINISTRATION DID PROVIDE

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:46.984
THOSE NOTIFICATIONS- SO WE'RE

00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:49.120
NOT SEEING ANY CASE WHERE

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:50.955
THERE'S- REQUIRED NOTIFICATIONS

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:52.523
OR REPORTING THAT THE

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.691
ADMINISTRATION'S FAILING TO

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.460
DEAL. I THINK IT'S MORE IN THE

00:34:55.526 --> 00:34:57.395
WAY THE STATE'S EMERGENCY

00:34:57.462 --> 00:34:59.096
SPENDING AUTHORITIES ARE SAT

00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:01.666
AT- IT GIVES A LOT OF

00:35:01.732 --> 00:35:03.901
FLEXIBILITY TO ADMINISTRATION.

00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:06.604
AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE REASONS

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:08.606
IN A TYPICAL EMERGENCY YOU KNOW

00:35:08.673 --> 00:35:10.441
THE VERSION YOU HAVE A FIRE AND

00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:11.976
THEN THE FIRE WOULD BE CUT OUT

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:13.077
AND THEN THE EMERGENCY WOULD BE

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:14.412
OVER AND THEN THERE IT JUST BE

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:16.047
SORT OF AFTER THE FACT.

00:35:16.113 --> 00:35:18.216
RECOVERY OPERATIONS- OF THE

00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:19.717
COVER NINETEEN EMERGENCY IS

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:21.118
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT IN THAT WERE

00:35:21.185 --> 00:35:22.086
STILL UNDER AN EMERGENCY

00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:23.754
DECLARATION THAT COULD CONTINUE

00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:26.224
FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS AND

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.025
SALAS EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:29.594
HADN'T PROVIDED FLEXIBILITY

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.394
THROUGH THE BUDGET

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:31.195
ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE

00:35:31.262 --> 00:35:33.664
FLEXIBILITY TO THE EMERGENCY

00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:36.200
SERVICES ACT- THAT STATUTE WAS

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:38.369
PUT INTO EFFECT IN I THINK IN

00:35:38.436 --> 00:35:45.510
NINETEEN SEVENTY. AND DOESN'T

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:46.277
HAVE ANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

00:35:46.344 --> 00:35:47.445
ON THAT GOAL WITH IT AND I

00:35:47.512 --> 00:35:48.346
THINK. IT'S PROBABLY FAIR TO

00:35:48.412 --> 00:35:49.714
SAY THAT WE HIS WAS IN PLACE.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.748
OKAY BEEN IN THAT WE HAVE

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:51.349
EMERGED. THAT WOULD GO ON FOR

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:53.084
MANY MONTHS EVEN. SUCH AS THE

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.619
PANDEMIC THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT

00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:59.924
NOW. THANK YOU. A DOCTOR PAN

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:02.426

THE L. A. O. FOR THEIR

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:05.763
PRESENTATION SO I GUESS I MIGHT

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.266
MY QUESTION IS REGARDING TRAIL-

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:10.268
IS THAT- AND I DON'T KNOW IF

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:12.637

SEVENTY. WHICH IN A

AVAILABLE FOR A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:07.218
DAYS. KIND OF. TRYING TO SAY

00:38:07.284 --> 00:38:07.818
WELL ABOUT HALF THE YEAR SO

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.220

STATE'S REGULAR BUDGET PROCESS-

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:14.592
BUT THAT THE STATUTE DOES ALLOW

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:16.027

00:45:57.387 --> 00:45:59.556
THEN IF WE ASSUME THAT WE WOULD

THAT AMOUNT WAS BASED UPON

00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:37.667
WHAT'S THE ESTIMATE OF WHAT

00:57:06.456 --> 00:57:10.360
THESE. ALLOCATIONS FOR

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:12.729
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THEY

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:15.064
WERE BASED ON WHAT PROJECTED

00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:17.300
TIME OF NEED AND AS THE COVERT

WORST CASE SCENARIO AND-

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:17.607
FORTUNATELY ENOUGH WE WERE ABLE

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:43.132
AVAILABLE OR BUILD OUT IN THE

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:50.173
EARLY STAGES. OF THIS AND

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:51.874

REMARKS BY SAYING THAT- I DO

01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:58.848
APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:02.385
ADMINISTRATION- PREPARED US FOR

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:06.989
A POTENTIAL- SEARCH AND- THE

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:08.658
CHALLENGE PUBLIC HEALTH IS THAT

01:02:08.724 --> 01:02:11.627
WHEN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:12.261
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GIVE CREDIT

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:12.829
TO THE FACT THAT WE WORK TO

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.330
MAKE NOT MAKE THAT HAPPENED

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:15.698
LET'S THIS WAY I PREFERRED THAT

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.767
WE PUT THE MONEY UP AND WE END

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:19.268
UP NOT HAVING TO USE IT AND

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:21.270
EVEN WHEN I CONSIDER THAT WASTE

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:23.739
OR NOT. THEN ACTUALLY NOT

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:24.841
HAVING DONE IT AND HAVE INSTEAD

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.809
PAID WITH LIVES SO I JUST HAVE

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:29.479
TO START WITH THAT- WHEN IT

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:31.881
COMES TO THIS SPENDING AGAIN

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:33.483
YOU KNOW HERE WE'RE TALKING

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:34.517
ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND SO

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.085
FORTH AND SOME OF THE

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:37.286
CHALLENGES FOR EXAMPLE I'M

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:38.921
LOOKING AT THE CHART FROM

01:02:38.988 --> 01:02:40.356
FINANCE- COVE IN NINETEEN TO

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:43.626
DIRECT RESPONSE COST ESTIMATES

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:44.227
Q. MILLER TOTAL EXPENDITURES.

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:45.628
AND THE CHALLENGE WE DON'T HAVE

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:49.532
DETAILS IS THAT. YOU KNOW FOR

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:52.535
EXAMPLE WE ARE ONLY SPENDING 6%

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.003
ARE ACTUALLY WELL IF YOU LOOK

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:55.771
AT THE AUGUST TOTAL WE LOOK AT

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:57.874
THE- AUGUST TOTAL WHICH WOULD

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.841
ACTUALLY REPRESENT THE ACTUAL

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:00.309
SPENDING VERSUS THE ESTIMATE

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:02.078
WELL HE SPENT SEVEN POINT 2% ON

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:03.579
STATEWIDE TESTING AND ONLY TWO

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:06.616
POINT 4% ON CONTACT TRACING THE

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:08.818
TWO THINGS THAT WE SHOULD MAKE

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:09.852
THE TOP PRIORITY. IN ORDER

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:10.820
CONTROL THIS PANDEMIC THAT'S

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:12.421
KEEPING OUR BUSINESS IS CLOSE

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:14.090
OUR SCHOOLS CLOSED NOW I DON'T

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:15.258
KNOW WHETHER THAT'S THE RIGHT

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:16.058
AMOUNT BECAUSE I DON'T JUST

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:17.426
DUMP MONEY INTO SOMETHING THAT

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:22.131
CAN ABSORB IT- BUT I GUESS THIS

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.132
IS WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE

01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:24.033
HAVE THIS KIND OF TRANSPARENCY

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.134
COULD BE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:26.736
MONEY RIGHT I MEAN I'M NOT

01:03:26.802 --> 01:03:28.004
DISPUTING THE FACT THAT WE'RE

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:32.708
SPENDING MONEY. ON OTHER THINGS

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:33.309
IN FOR EXAMPLE THE PROCUREMENT

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:33.943
WAS NO TO P. THE WOULD ACTUALLY

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.077
FOR TESTING COURSE THAT DOESN'T

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:37.780
FALL UNDER TESTING CATEGORY SO

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:38.915
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:40.650
THERE'S A MORE DETAILED

01:03:40.716 --> 01:03:42.218
EXPLANATION FROM THE

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:43.586
ADMINISTRATION OTHERWISE WHAT

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:44.654
HAPPENS IS I'M LEFT OF THE

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.389
CHART LIKE THIS AND I COULD

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:47.256
CERTAINLY CRITICIZED

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:49.892
ADMINISTRATION FOR UNDER

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:50.526
SPENDING IN PUBLIC HEALTH. THE

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:51.928
AT PERCENTAGES. SO THAT'S WHY

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:52.795
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:54.463
ACCIDENTAL HOW MUCH MONEY IS

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:55.431
GOING TO OUR LOCAL HEALTH

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.366
DEPARTMENTS. HOW MUCH MONEY ARE

01:03:57.433 --> 01:03:59.602
WE REALLY SPENDING. ON TESTING

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.103
OUT IN THE COMMUNITY I KNOW

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.705
THAT- SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:03.706
HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE LACK OF

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.441
TESTING AVAILABILITY RIGHT IS

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:08.344
THIS SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS- THESE

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:10.746
ARE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT. WE

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:12.481
DO NEED THE ADMINISTRATION TO

01:04:12.548 --> 01:04:14.984
HELP EXPLAIN. BECAUSE OTHERWISE

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:16.219
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT PEOPLE

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:17.420
DROP PERHAPS INAPPROPRIATE

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:18.754
CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE

01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:20.423
PRIORITIES AND THE STRATEGY OF

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:23.526
THE ADMINISTRATION. SO I JUST.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.027
YOU KNOW SO I I'D REALLY DO

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:26.862
WANT EARNERS ADMINISTRATION TO

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:31.367
THINK CAREFULLY. ABOUT THE NEED

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:31.901
FOR EXPLANATIONS AND FULL

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:35.271
DISCLOSURES OF. HOW MONEY IS

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:37.240
BEING SPENT. NOT JUST BECAUSE

01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:38.941
WE'RE ASKING IS BECAUSE ON

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:40.376
FORTY PEOPLE CAN DRAW.

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:41.210
POTENTIALLY INAPPROPRIATE

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:43.212
CONCLUSIONS. AND SO I WOULD

01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:45.181
JUST MAKE NOTE AND IS I'M DOING

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:45.848
JUST A QUICK YOU KNOW

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.750
CALCULATION OF. THESE

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.852
EXPENDITURES. AND CERTAINLY I

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:52.255
AM YOU KNOW. THAT YOU KNOW

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:54.457
THESE TO ME THESE TWO ARE THE

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:56.158
TOP PRIORITIES FOR TRYING TO

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:57.260
CONTROL THIS PANDEMIC THAT

01:04:57.326 --> 01:04:58.894
UNDERLIES OUR UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:04:58.961 --> 01:04:59.662
THAT UNDERLIES OUR SCHOOL

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:00.863
CLOSURES THAT UNDERLIES OUR

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.832
BUSINESS IS BEING CLOSED. AND

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:03.966
YET THERE ARE ONLY A FRACTION

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:08.170
OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT. AND WHY IT

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:09.305
AND SO BE ABLE TO HAVE A BETTER

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:11.240
UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHY WE'RE

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:13.576
SPENDING EXACTLY HOW MUCH. FOR

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:16.746
DIFFERENT THINGS IS GOING TO BE

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:17.346
IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:17.980
BETTER COMMUNICATE TO THE- THAT

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:18.614
WE HAVE OUR PRIORITIES

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:19.949
STRAIGHT. AND I DON'T NOBODY

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:21.550
WANNA RESPOND TO THAT FINANCE

THEY'RE FOR THE WORKERS- THAT'S

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:42.164
VERY IMPORTANT- THERE'S BEEN

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:44.700
NUMEROUS ARTICLES IN LA TIMES

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:45.934

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:05.080
TIME WE HVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:06.115
SPEAK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:07.216
WE LEARN SOMETHING NEW AND I

01:13:07.282 --> 01:13:10.552
THINK THAT'S THAT'S GREAT BUT-

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:11.086
IT MAY BE THAT. WE CAN BE

01:13:11.153 --> 01:13:12.654
HELPFUL IN SOME OF OUR EFFORTS

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:14.356
TO TRY TO STEM THIS- TERRIBLE

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:16.425
DISEASE YEAH AND- THAT'S REALLY

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:18.393
KIND OF THE POINT THAT I WANT

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:25.601
TO THAT I WANT TO LEAVE WITH-

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:26.835
DETERMINE WHERE THE MONEY IS

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.270
BEING SPENT AND THEN. TO

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:29.705
WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY BEING

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:32.341
EFFECTIVE AND GETTING US TO A

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:33.208
PLACE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:35.878
ABLE TO- OPEN OUR OUR OUR

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:39.414
BUSINESSES IN OUR SCHOOLS- SO

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:41.116
MY FIRST QUESTION I THOUGHT SO

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:42.484
MY DISTRICT HAS TWENTY SEVEN

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:43.719
CITIES FOUR OF WHICH ARE LARGER

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:45.320
THAN FORTY THOUSAND BUT MOST

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:48.891
ARE SMALL. FARMWORKERS RURAL-

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:51.493
COMMUNITIES AND IF YOU HAD

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.495
ASKED ME THREE MONTHS AGO

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:55.564
WHETHER I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:57.966
GOING TO SEE AN UPSWING OF

01:13:58.033 --> 01:13:59.868
INFECTION AMONG. LATINO

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:00.769
FARMWORKERS I WOULD'VE SAID

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:03.205
ABSOLUTELY NUMBER ONE BECAUSE

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.706
THEY WERE GOING TO WORK AND THE

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:06.975
WORK HASN'T CHANGED IN MANY OF

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:09.311
THE FEELS. FROM THE WAY THEY

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:12.181
DID THE WORK. A YEAR AGO AND

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:13.749
I'VE SEEN IT WITH MY OWN EYES

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:16.018
AND PEOPLE ARE WORKING SHOULDER

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:16.985
TO SHOULDER AND THEN THE GOING

01:14:17.052 --> 01:14:19.922
HOME TO OVERCROWDED SITUATIONS

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.323
DURING OUR TO DO DUE TO OUR

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:25.294
HOUSING CRISIS- AND SO. WHEN WE

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.663
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TESTING THE

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:29.097
TESTING FOR THE MOST PART HAS

01:14:29.164 --> 01:14:31.166
BEEN PLACED IN BIG CITIES- IN

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:32.801
TERMS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:34.937
AND SO THAT THE SMALL

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:37.139
COMMUNITIES. WHO DESPERATELY

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:40.042
NEED TESTING ARE NOT GETTING

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:40.609
THE TESTING SITES THAT THEY

01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:41.610
NEEDED AND SO THERE'S THIS

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:46.248
DISCONNECT BETWEEN- WHERE THE-TESTING SITES ARE LOCATED AND

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.383
WHO GETS FIRST PRIORITY AND

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:50.319
WHETHER IT'S EASY ENOUGH. FOR

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:51.620
THE FAMILY MEMBERS TO BE ABLE

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:53.422
TO GO AND GET A TEST DONE SO

01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:55.357
TESTING CONTINUES TO BE TO BE A

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:57.626
REAL PROBLEM AND BECAUSE OF THE

01:14:57.693 --> 01:14:59.661
LACK OF TESTING. THE INFECTION

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:01.830
RATE HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:04.466
EXPLODE TO A POINT WHERE NOW-

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:06.501
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:07.236
COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT THEY

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:08.871
DID NOT USED TO BE ON THE RED

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:10.439
LEICESTER NOW ON THE RED LAST

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:13.575
AND SO- NUMBER ONE IS I'M I'M-

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:15.444
CONCERNED ABOUT. WHETHER WORK

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:16.211
TOWARD MEETING WITH THE

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:18.847
COUNTIES WHO HAVE RECEIVED

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:19.581
COUNTIES AND CITIES WHO HAVE

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:21.817
RECEIVED KERR'S MONEY SO THAT

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:23.752

AND WHERE THEY CAN ACT TOSE

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:39.968
TESTINGS REALLY. ON AND THEN

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:42.137
THEN NUMBER TWO IS. THAT THE

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:45.207
HOUSE FOR. PROGRAM IS REALLY

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:48.577
IMPORTANT- BUT WHY IT'S HOUSED

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:51.446
IN CDFA. IT IS A QUESTION THAT

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:53.115
I ASK AND I LEARNED TODAY THAT

OUR COUNTY PARTNERS BUT IT'S

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:43.371

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:49.411
IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO GET

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:50.679
COOPERATION SO THAT THEY

01:20:50.745 --> 01:20:52.814

01:24:53.788 --> 01:24:54.989
THE ENTIRETY OF THE GREAT PLACE

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:56.558

OF THE DIFFERENCES THAT'S-

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:03.965
PRETTY CLOSE TO THAT AMOUNT OF

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:04.833
WHAT WE STAYED IN THE OTHER

LAND WHICH IS NEAR THE TOP OF

01:25:10.972 --> 01:25:11.739
THE CHART AND THAT ONE WENT UP

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:15.276

PERHAPS MATERIALIZE IN NINETEEN

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:01.956
TWENTY OR SHIFTING SO THAT

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:04.626
GROSSED OUT ONE POINT ONE FIVE

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:05.894

01:46:42.763 --> 01:46:44.097
ACCOUNT FOR COUNTIES THAT DO

INSTILLS CONFIDENCE IN OUR

SYSTEM PARTNERS SO THAT WE

01:47:08.121 --> 01:47:09.589
AVOID MORE YOUTH ENTERING THE

01:47:09.656 --> 01:47:11.491
ADULT SYSTEM. WE MUST

01:47:11.558 --> 01:47:12.659
COORDINATE ADDITIONS TO THE

01:47:12.726 --> 01:47:14.094

BALANCES THAT WORK TOGETHER.

01:47:27.741 --> 01:47:28.275
AND FINALLY AS THE STATE WE

01:47:28.341 --> 01:47:29.676

THROUGH. THE DJJ POPULATION HAS

01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:08.448
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SKIN NEEDS

02:08:23.228 --> 02:08:25.864
COUNTIES- THE REASON FOR DOING

02:08:25.931 --> 02:08:27.232
THAT IS THAT THE EVIDENCE HAS

02:08:27.299 --> 02:08:28.934

TAKEN APART IT IS MY

02:11:28.013 --> 02:11:30.682

BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCALS-

02:11:35.654 --> 02:11:36.822

BE THE VEHICLE FOR MAKING THIS

02:11:56.441 --> 02:11:58.844

REALIGNMENT MODEL AS WAS

REFERENCE BY THE L. A. AND

02:16:19.237 --> 02:16:22.741
OBVIOUSLY THIS ACTION MANY MANY

02:16:22.807 --> 02:16:25.210
MANY YEARS AGO CURRENT. AD

02:16:25.277 --> 02:16:26.244
WHICH I DON'T REALLY RECALL I'M

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:28.179
NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH TINY

02:16:28.246 --> 02:16:32.784
ELEVEN THE. AND THE- MOSTRI.

02:16:32.851 --> 02:16:34.886
ACTION BY THE LEGISLATURE BASED

02:16:34.953 --> 02:16:37.455
ON THE GOVERNOR OF OWN PROPOSAL

02:16:37.522 --> 02:16:40.091
WAS LAST YEAR WHEN THE GOVERNOR

02:16:40.158 --> 02:16:42.427
AS DOCTOR ROSS REFERENCED YOU

02:16:42.494 --> 02:16:44.029
REFERENCED RIGHT AFTER IS HIS

02:16:44.095 --> 02:16:45.897
INAUGURATION BUT THEN. THE

02:16:45.964 --> 02:16:49.334
GOVERNOR- MADE A CONCRETE

02:16:49.401 --> 02:16:52.203
PROPOSAL LAST YEAR WHEN HE

02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:54.806
PROPOSED TO IN HIS WORDS AND

02:16:54.873 --> 02:16:56.408
THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS

02:16:56.474 --> 02:17:01.613
WE KNOW IT. AND MOVE A DJJ INTO

02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:03.682
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. TO

02:17:03.748 --> 02:17:06.051
FOLLOWING NEW MODEL THAT WOULD

02:17:06.117 --> 02:17:09.254
ALLOW HEALTH OFFICIALS TO MOVE

02:17:09.321 --> 02:17:12.157
TOWARDS ADDRESSING SUCH THINGS

02:17:12.223 --> 02:17:14.859
AS EARLY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. AND

02:17:14.926 --> 02:17:18.430
THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED THAT-

02:17:18.496 --> 02:17:21.199
ACTION WE ENACTED IT TO MOVE TO

02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:23.201
MAKE THAT MOVEMENT NOW IT WAS

02:17:23.268 --> 02:17:26.071
SILENT ON THE CLOSURE OF THE

02:17:26.137 --> 02:17:28.773
STATE FACILITIES NOW NONE OF US

02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:30.842
I THINK IN THE DISCUSSIONS AND

02:17:30.909 --> 02:17:32.510
WHILE IT WASN'T NECESSARILY

02:17:32.577 --> 02:17:34.646
DEBATED ON THE FLOOR. IN THE

02:17:34.713 --> 02:17:36.748
DISCUSSIONS IN THE BUDGET

02:17:36.815 --> 02:17:38.683
SUBCOMMITTEES. THERE WAS

02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:40.151
DISCUSSION ABOUT DID THE

02:17:40.218 --> 02:17:42.887
ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATE IN

02:17:42.954 --> 02:17:45.390
THIS MOVE OVER TIME POTENTIALLY

02:17:45.457 --> 02:17:47.492
CLOSING THOSE STATE FACILITIES

02:17:47.559 --> 02:17:50.428
WHICH HAS BEEN. DISCUSSED FOR

02:17:50.495 --> 02:17:52.397
MANY YEARS AND IN FACT WE HAVE

02:17:52.464 --> 02:17:54.866
FAR FEWER WE HAVE QUITE A GOOD

02:17:54.933 --> 02:17:56.234
RUN GREAT REDUCTION IN THE

02:17:56.301 --> 02:17:57.268
NUMBER OF YOUTH THERE ARE

02:17:57.335 --> 02:17:58.803
SERVED IN THE STATE FACILITIES

02:17:58.870 --> 02:18:02.040
AND QUITE. A SMALLER NUMBER OF

02:18:02.107 --> 02:18:04.142
THEM THAN WE HAVE IN PASSED AND

02:18:04.209 --> 02:18:07.212
SO WHILE IT WAS AN EXPLICIT IN

02:18:07.278 --> 02:18:08.747
THE ACTION THAT WE TOOK LAST

02:18:08.813 --> 02:18:10.949
YEAR. I THINK THERE WAS SOME

02:18:11.016 --> 02:18:13.618
ANTICIPATION THAT OVER TIME

02:18:13.685 --> 02:18:16.354
WITH DJJ BEING UNDER HEALTH AND

02:18:16.421 --> 02:18:18.223
HUMAN SERVICES THERE WOULD BE A

02:18:18.289 --> 02:18:20.925
CHANGE TO THE PRACTICE OF THE

02:18:20.992 --> 02:18:22.827
STATE RUN DJJ FACILITIES THOUGH

02:18:22.894 --> 02:18:25.697
AGAIN IT WAS NOT EXPLICIT IN

02:18:25.764 --> 02:18:27.432
THE PROPOSAL. SO NOW THIS YEAR

02:18:27.499 --> 02:18:31.770
WE ARE AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED

02:18:31.836 --> 02:18:32.303
AND DESCRIBED FACED WITH A

02:18:32.370 --> 02:18:33.805
CHANGE WE'RE WOULD BE UNDER A

02:18:33.872 --> 02:18:35.407
REALIGNMENT MODEL AND THE

02:18:35.473 --> 02:18:37.809
REALIGNMENT MODEL BEING RATHER

02:18:37.876 --> 02:18:41.046
THAN THE- STATE DJJ FACILITIES

02:18:41.112 --> 02:18:42.580
THAT THEY WOULD BE EXPLICITLY

02:18:42.647 --> 02:18:44.582
CLOSE THAT'S EXPLICITLY IN THE

02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:47.485
PROPOSAL. AND ARE COUNTIES

02:18:47.552 --> 02:18:49.354
WOULD HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY

02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:50.755
FOR THE ATTACK AND I THINK

02:18:50.822 --> 02:18:53.658
THERE'S- ASISTIR ALREADY BEEN

02:18:53.725 --> 02:18:56.661
HEARD YOU KNOW MUCH. MUCH TO BE

02:18:56.728 --> 02:18:58.897
SAID FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR

02:18:58.963 --> 02:19:02.434
YOUTH BEING. HELD OR TREATED

02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:04.436
CLOSER TO HOME CLOSER TO THEIR

02:19:04.502 --> 02:19:06.371
SUPPORT SERVICES TO THEIR

02:19:06.438 --> 02:19:08.406
ENVIRONMENT. I THINK ONE OF THE

02:19:08.473 --> 02:19:12.077
KEY ISSUES BEFORE US IS. WE

02:19:12.143 --> 02:19:14.679
WILL AND I WONDER AND I WANTED

02:19:14.746 --> 02:19:16.147
TO PARTMINER FINANCE TO-

02:19:16.214 --> 02:19:17.916
RESPOND TO THIS WHY DID THE

02:19:17.982 --> 02:19:19.250
GOVERNOR MOVE AWAY FROM THE

02:19:19.317 --> 02:19:20.985
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MODEL

02:19:21.052 --> 02:19:22.487
NUMBER FOR THE ANSWER I JUST

02:19:22.554 --> 02:19:23.755
WANT TO POINT OUT. THE

02:19:23.822 --> 02:19:25.790
CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY TEN

02:19:25.857 --> 02:19:28.126
STATES. THAT HAS JUVENILE

02:19:28.193 --> 02:19:29.894
JUSTICE UNDER CORRECTIONS AND

02:19:29.961 --> 02:19:31.529
IF WE IN A FOR EXAMPLE WE MOVE

02:19:31.596 --> 02:19:33.064
STRICT PROBATION AS MUCH AS

02:19:33.131 --> 02:19:34.999
PROBATION HAS SOME VERY GOOD

02:19:35.066 --> 02:19:37.268
SERVICES IN VARIOUS COUNTIES IT

02:19:37.335 --> 02:19:39.070
IS A CORRECTIONS MODEL SO

02:19:39.137 --> 02:19:40.238
THERE'S ONLY TEN STATES WITH

02:19:40.305 --> 02:19:44.008
THAT. FORTY FORTY STATES HAVE

02:19:44.075 --> 02:19:45.677
JUVENILE. UNDER EITHER HEALTH

02:19:45.744 --> 02:19:47.011
AND HUMAN SERVICES- CHILD

02:19:47.078 --> 02:19:49.013
WELFARE SO I JUST WONDERED IF

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:51.149
DEPARTMENT FINANCE ONE COMMENT

02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:53.084
WHY. THE GOVERNOR IN THE

02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:56.521
REALIGNMENT PROPOSAL MOVED AWAY

02:19:56.588 --> 02:19:57.055
FROM THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:19:57.122 --> 02:20:02.327
SERVICES MODEL. S. FIRST TIME

02:20:02.393 --> 02:20:04.929
THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS

02:20:04.996 --> 02:20:09.267
FORMALLY PROPOSED- A

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:09.834
REALIGNMENT TO THE COUNTY AS

02:20:09.901 --> 02:20:10.802
WELL AS IN THE MAYOR AND

02:20:10.869 --> 02:20:12.470
UNDERLINE CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE

02:20:12.537 --> 02:20:13.772
TIME WERE SORT OF WE WERE IN

02:20:13.838 --> 02:20:15.306
THE PANDEMIC IN ONE TIME SIR

02:20:15.373 --> 02:20:17.175
DEALING WITH THE FINANCIAL.

02:20:17.242 --> 02:20:20.578
OUTCOMES OF THAT- AND IT AND IT

02:20:20.645 --> 02:20:22.647
SORT OF JUST MADE US LOOK AT

02:20:22.714 --> 02:20:24.549
OUR JUVENILE SYSTEM AND THINK

02:20:24.616 --> 02:20:26.384
ABOUT IT ARE WE USING OUR

02:20:26.451 --> 02:20:27.919
RESOURCES IN THE MOST EFFICIENT

02:20:27.986 --> 02:20:30.688
WAY- THERE AROUND EIGHT EIGHT

02:20:30.755 --> 02:20:34.292
HUNDRED USE CURRENTLY IN DJJ-

02:20:34.359 --> 02:20:35.927
MANY THERE ARE MANY LOCAL

02:20:35.994 --> 02:20:38.463
FACILITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

02:20:38.530 --> 02:20:40.265
TODAY THAT AREN'T BEING

02:20:40.331 --> 02:20:43.968
UTILIZED- AND- COUPLE THAT WITH

02:20:44.035 --> 02:20:46.538
THE SUCCESS THAT. TOOK PLACE-

02:20:46.604 --> 02:20:48.373
IN THE PAST UNDER SIMILAR

02:20:48.439 --> 02:20:51.509
REALIGNMENTS. THEY CAME DOWN TO

02:20:51.576 --> 02:20:54.179
A SORT OF YOU KNOW. OUR IS IT

02:20:54.245 --> 02:20:56.147
BEST POSITIONED MOVING THIS

02:20:56.214 --> 02:20:57.081
OVER TO HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:20:57.148 --> 02:20:58.249
SERVICE AT THE STATE LEVEL OR

02:20:58.316 --> 02:20:59.250
SHOULD WE SHOULD BE THINKING

02:20:59.317 --> 02:21:00.218
ABOUT THIS AND A LITTLE BIT

02:21:00.285 --> 02:21:02.453
DIFFERENT LANDS- LET'S BE

02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:04.189
AFFECTED WITH YOU AND ARE

02:21:04.255 --> 02:21:05.757
FINDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:21:05.824 --> 02:21:07.025
ALLOWING THEM TO KEEP THEM

02:21:07.091 --> 02:21:08.493
CLOSE TO THE FAMILIES.

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:10.628
COMMUNITIES ALLOW THAT SORT OF

02:21:10.695 --> 02:21:16.968
LOCAL SORT OF- DID YOU KNOW.

02:21:17.035 --> 02:21:17.602
DEVELOPMENT AND RANCH PLAN AN

02:21:17.669 --> 02:21:18.570
OLD STUFF THAT TAKE THERE

02:21:18.636 --> 02:21:19.204
THAT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO DO IT

02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:22.674
OF STATE BUT STILL AND BE

02:21:22.740 --> 02:21:24.542
BENEFICIAL- SO I THINK I SAID

02:21:24.609 --> 02:21:25.410
THAT WAS THE OVER RIDING

02:21:25.476 --> 02:21:30.882
DECISION. SORT OF AT THE TIME

02:21:30.949 --> 02:21:33.151
INCLUDING THE NEIGHBORING SO IT

02:21:33.218 --> 02:21:33.751
IS I MEAN AND I THINK THAT'S

02:21:33.818 --> 02:21:34.352
WHY SAID THAT WE SORT OF THE

02:21:34.419 --> 02:21:35.720
CREE. FACTOR THAT PUSHED TO DO

02:21:35.787 --> 02:21:41.526
A RIGHT. RIGHT NOW. AND SO I IT

02:21:41.593 --> 02:21:43.094
JUST HAD BEEN BUILT FIRST ALONG

02:21:43.161 --> 02:21:44.929
TIME AS THE L. A. O. PLAN OUT

02:21:44.996 --> 02:21:46.764
AND IT WAS WE ACTUALLY AT THE

02:21:46.831 --> 02:21:48.500
END OF BROWN ADMINISTRATION WAS

02:21:48.566 --> 02:21:50.969
PROPOSED IN TWELVE THIRTEEN SO

02:21:51.035 --> 02:21:53.938
THIS IS- HI. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN

02:21:54.005 --> 02:21:55.673
PART OF THE DISK BUT I THINK

02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:57.075
THAT IMPETUS WAS SORT OF.

02:21:57.141 --> 02:22:00.378
FISCAL AND DYNAMIC- ACTORS BUT

02:22:00.445 --> 02:22:02.113
CERTAINLY CERTAINLY HAS A LOT

02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:03.748
OF. GREAT POLICY ANGLES WHICH I

02:22:03.815 --> 02:22:07.685
THINK MAKES SENSE WHY WE THINK

02:22:07.752 --> 02:22:08.686
IT'S SUCH A GOOD PROPOSAL.

02:22:08.753 --> 02:22:11.556
PERFECT ON THAT. I'M SO I

02:22:11.623 --> 02:22:13.758
APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION OF

02:22:13.825 --> 02:22:17.362
THE MOVE TO. TO HAVING IT

02:22:17.428 --> 02:22:19.063
MINISTERED ON WHY DON'T KNOW IF

02:22:19.130 --> 02:22:20.098
IT MINISTERS RIGHT WAY BUT

02:22:20.164 --> 02:22:21.966
BASICALLY THE YOUTH BEING.

02:22:22.033 --> 02:22:25.203
HANDLED ON THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT-

02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:28.339
COULDN'T THAT STILL BE ACHIEVED.

02:22:28.406 --> 02:22:30.775
S. IS PROPOSED IN THIS OTHER

02:22:30.842 --> 02:22:32.210
MODEL THROUGH HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:22:32.277 --> 02:22:34.245
SERVICES SO STILL HAVING

02:22:34.312 --> 02:22:35.179
REALIGNMENT STILL GOING TO

02:22:35.246 --> 02:22:39.284
COUNTIES BUT HAVING IT ERA THE

02:22:39.350 --> 02:22:44.455
OVERSIGHT AND THE- GUIDANCE

02:22:44.522 --> 02:22:47.625
AND- GUIDELINES FOR IT BEING

02:22:47.692 --> 02:22:48.459
ADMINISTERED THROUGH A HEALTH

02:22:48.526 --> 02:22:49.827
AND HUMAN SERVICES SO THAT'S

02:22:49.894 --> 02:22:51.663
REALLY QUESTION RESCUES WHY DID

02:22:51.729 --> 02:22:53.598
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL MOVE

02:22:53.665 --> 02:22:54.966
FROM THAT BECAUSE IT COULD

02:22:55.033 --> 02:22:57.201
CONCEIVABLY AS IS PROPOSED IN

02:22:57.268 --> 02:22:58.503
THIS ALTERNATIVE YOU COULD

02:22:58.569 --> 02:23:01.506
STILL HAVE A REALIGNMENT AS THE

02:23:01.572 --> 02:23:03.775
AS YOU JUST EXPLAINED. YOU CAN

02:23:03.841 --> 02:23:06.110
STILL ACHIEVE THAT A CLOSURE OF

02:23:06.177 --> 02:23:07.745
THE STATE FACILITIES AND

02:23:07.812 --> 02:23:09.180
PROVISION OF THE YOUTH BEING

02:23:09.247 --> 02:23:11.082
HANDLED ON THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT

02:23:11.149 --> 02:23:12.116
STILL STILL THROUGH A HEALTH

02:23:12.183 --> 02:23:13.785
AND HUMAN SERVICES MODEL SO IF

02:23:13.851 --> 02:23:15.553
YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT SPECIFIC

02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:18.156
OF WHY THE- GOVERNOR MOVED AWAY

02:23:18.222 --> 02:23:21.326
FROM THAT. WELL I THINK THERE'S

02:23:21.392 --> 02:23:23.161
A COUPLE OF FACTORS HERE IS

02:23:23.227 --> 02:23:24.595
THAT ONE I THINK THEY

02:23:24.662 --> 02:23:26.698
DEMONSTRATED TRACK RECORD OF

02:23:26.764 --> 02:23:29.100
TOWNIES- PERFORMANCE AS I'VE

02:23:29.167 --> 02:23:31.536
ALREADY DESCRIBED AS SORT OF. A

02:23:31.602 --> 02:23:32.770
LOUD MOST OF US TO FEEL

02:23:32.837 --> 02:23:34.539
COMFORTABLE THAT THEY THAT THEY

02:23:34.605 --> 02:23:36.908
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS-

02:23:36.975 --> 02:23:40.111
WITH THIS POPULATION- TOO I

02:23:42.714 --> 02:23:44.048
ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE

02:23:44.115 --> 02:23:45.717
PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED

02:23:45.783 --> 02:23:47.919
ARE MUCH MORE BROAD BASED THIS

02:23:47.986 --> 02:23:49.754
THAT. SORT OF TRANSFER

02:23:49.821 --> 02:23:52.623
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE EIGHT

02:23:52.690 --> 02:23:53.424
HUNDRED MAYBE THE HIGHEST NEED

02:23:53.491 --> 02:23:54.625
YOUTH IN THE STATE IS GOING TO

02:23:54.692 --> 02:23:56.060
BE A DIFFICULT ENDEAVOR A BY

02:23:56.127 --> 02:23:58.029
ITSELF. AND SO SORT OF

02:23:58.096 --> 02:24:01.032
EXPANDING ON MAKING ADDITIONAL

02:24:01.099 --> 02:24:03.668
CHANGES TO OVERSIGHT AND OTHER

02:24:03.735 --> 02:24:05.803

PROPOSAL ACTOR AT RISK- AND SO

02:24:10.608 --> 02:24:11.976
OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN REALLY SORT

02:24:12.043 --> 02:24:14.512
OF ON. WHAT IS NECESSARY TO

DEMONSTRATED OVER. THE LAST TEN

02:24:22.954 --> 02:24:24.856
OR FIFTEEN YEARS SO I THINK

02:24:24.922 --> 02:24:26.791

ON THE REALIGNMENT CELLS- AND

02:24:31.796 --> 02:24:32.930
TRYING NOT IN TRYING TO MAKE

02:24:32.997 --> 02:24:34.899
SURE THAT SUCCESSFUL. VERSUS

02:24:34.966 --> 02:24:37.435

02:24:37.502 --> 02:24:39.437
POLICY CHANGES AND YOU KNOW

02:24:39.504 --> 02:24:41.406
WHAT MOVING OVERSIGHT ENTIRELY

02:24:41.472 --> 02:24:43.408
DIFFERENT ENTITY OR SOMETHING

02:24:43.474 --> 02:24:49.547

OBJECTIVES THAT YOU DESCRIBED

02:24:58.222 --> 02:25:00.358
CAN BE ACHIEVED IN TERMS OF

02:25:00.425 --> 02:25:02.927
THAT FIVE. THE ROLE OF THE

EXPERTISE IN YOUTH HEALTH AND

02:25:13.871 --> 02:25:18.843
WELLNESS SO I THINK THAT THE

02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:19.744
LEGISLATURE'S ALTERNATIVE DOES

02:25:19.811 --> 02:25:24.549

02:25:43.768 --> 02:25:45.069
WE AGREED WITH FROM THE

OF GOING THROUGH THE HEALTH AND

02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:52.310
WELLNESS LENS SO I THINK THE

02:25:52.376 --> 02:25:55.046
LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL HAS

02:25:55.113 --> 02:25:55.546

IMPACT THE LARGER SYSTEMATIC

02:32:20.764 --> 02:32:21.932
TIME WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO

02:32:21.999 --> 02:32:23.868
REALIGN THIS COMPLEX OUR

02:32:23.934 --> 02:32:28.939
POPULATION- COULD JEOPARDIZE

02:32:29.006 --> 02:32:29.540

MOST CONCERNED THAT THIS

02:32:38.849 --> 02:32:41.018
PROCESS IS CENTERED AROUND THE

02:32:41.085 --> 02:32:42.786

02:32:57.368 --> 02:32:58.035
THINK THAT IS THE MOST

02:32:58.102 --> 02:32:59.270
IMPORTANT THING THAT WE WANT TO

02:32:59.336 --> 02:33:01.205
SEE HAPPEN AND WE KNOW THAT WE

02:33:01.272 --> 02:33:02.573

CHALLENGE IS GETTING IT RIGHT.

02:33:28.132 --> 02:33:31.535
I THINK THE BROAD OBJECTIVE IS

02:33:31.602 --> 02:33:33.203
DECRIMINALIZATION LOOKING TO

02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:35.072
CAUSES TREATMENT AND

02:33:35.139 --> 02:33:38.509
EMPOWERMENT OF YOUTH I HAD SOME

02:33:38.576 --> 02:33:40.210
QUESTIONS BUT IN THE INTEREST

02:33:40.277 --> 02:33:42.746
OF TIME I THINK I'LL JUST OFFER

02:33:42.813 --> 02:33:47.284
A COUPLE OF MORE OBSERVATIONS-

02:33:47.351 --> 02:33:49.019
I AGREE WITH SENATOR BELL'S

02:33:49.086 --> 02:33:51.121
COMMENTS ALSO SENATOR LEYVA.

02:33:51.188 --> 02:33:54.925
THAT FAMILIES OFTEN THE SOURCE

02:33:54.992 --> 02:33:58.629
OF TRAUMA. AND NEEDS TO BE

02:33:58.696 --> 02:34:01.665
EITHER INCLUDED OR IDENTIFIED

02:34:01.732 --> 02:34:04.101
AS TO WHAT IS BEST FOR THAT AT

02:34:04.168 --> 02:34:08.138
RISK YOUTH I THINK ONE OF THE

02:34:08.205 --> 02:34:09.139
CHALLENGES I KNOW WE FACE IN

02:34:09.206 --> 02:34:11.408
THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT. IS

02:34:11.475 --> 02:34:14.078
INSUFFICIENT NUMBER OF TRAINED

02:34:14.144 --> 02:34:16.280
PSYCHIATRISTS- CULTURALLY

02:34:16.347 --> 02:34:19.083
SENSITIVE. PSYCHIATRISTS

02:34:19.149 --> 02:34:22.519
PSYCHOLOGISTS THERAPISTS. AND I

02:34:22.586 --> 02:34:24.822
THINK WE SHOULD PARTNER ON THIS

02:34:24.888 --> 02:34:26.624
INITIATIVE WITH EDUCATIONAL

02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:29.093

02:34:41.972 --> 02:34:44.441
CULTURALLY SENSE IT ALONG WITH

02:34:44.508 --> 02:34:46.844
THAT WOULD BE PEER SUPPORT- IN

02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:50.314
THE THERAPY MODALTIES- I WOULD

02:34:50.381 --> 02:34:52.950

YOUTH CONSERVATION CAMP. I

02:35:02.726 --> 02:35:03.293

CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS

02:35:06.497 --> 02:35:11.402

02:35:50.074 --> 02:35:52.176
PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN PROVIDE
