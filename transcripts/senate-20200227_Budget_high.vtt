RECENT YEARS WE'VE SEEN

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.401
SIGNIFICANT MORE. FUNDING BASED

ON TIME AUGMENTATIONS. AND SO

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:03.676
ON THE FIFTH PAGE OF YOUR HAND

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.214
MOST OF THE HOMELESS SERVICES

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.149

HOUSING POLICIES OR RENT

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:42.048
STABILIZATION POLICIES IN THEIR

SOME OF THE MAJOR RECENT STATE

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:52.425
ACTIONS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:52.992
SO WE HAVE THE NO PLACE LIKE

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:55.194
HOME. THE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.329
AUTHORIZED BY THE VOTERS THAT

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:58.130
MADE A TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:00.666
AVAILABLE. FOR PERMITS A PART

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:02.201
OF HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:04.036
ARE MENTALLY ILL. AND THEN WE

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:06.172
SEE A TWO PROPOSALS THAT IN

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:07.340
NEXT PANELIST WILL SPEAK ON IN

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:09.809

BILLION DOLLARS MADE LEVEL TWO

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:14.780
CITIES COUNTIES CANYONS OF CARE

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:17.450
TO PROVIDE A NUMBER. IS PRIME.

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:22.321
I IF. LESS IT'S ON THE FINAL

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:24.757
PAGE OF THE I WANTED HER TO

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:26.292
TRANSITION TO A DISCUSSION

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:27.760
ABOUT THE FREE MARKET HAS A TO

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:31.297
THINK THROUGH NEXT AT. THE

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:32.498
LEDGE HAS DEMONSTRATED IN IN

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:35.234
HOMELESSNESS THROUGH SORT OF-

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:39.905
YOU KNOW THE APPLICATIONS THAT

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:43.776
HAVE BEEN RISE IN RECENT YEARS.

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:47.313
CHRIS AGAIN EVEN SAID. INVEST

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:47.913
COULD BE MADE WITHOUT SHOWING

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.715
MUST BUDGET PROGRESS OF THERE'S

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:51.984
NOT A STRATEGIC APPROACH IN HOW

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:53.052
THOSE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED. AND

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:55.054
SO THIS IS A FINAL PAGE LAYS

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:56.055
OUT. I THINK THE LEGISLATURE

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:58.190

UNDERSTANDING THE TRADE OFFS

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:07.833
BETWEEN A BROAD APPROACH AND

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.969
MORE FOCUSED APPROACH WHERE A

00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:11.670
BROAD APPROACH- COULD PROVIDE

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:13.239
WORK MORE GREATER MORE RELIEF

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:14.874

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:53.601
QUICK OR MOVE ON TO MY LIST OF.

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:55.837
I HEARD TWO DATA POINTS TO

01:27:55.903 --> 01:27:58.673
SPECIFIC DATA POINTS TODAY- THE

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.041
REFERENCE I BELIEVE IT WAS MISS

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:02.644
SUDDEN ETHNOLOGY THAT THE AFTER

01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:03.778
AMERICA POPULATION CALIFORNIA

01:28:03.845 --> 01:28:07.582
IS UNDER 8% AND YET STATEWIDE-

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:09.584
ARE OVER REPRESENTATION IN THE

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:12.387
ON HOUSE- POPULATION IS 30% IN

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:14.122
MY HOME COUNTY VALLEY IT'S MUCH

01:28:14.188 --> 01:28:15.523
HIGHER THAN THAT THAT WAS AN

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.858
INTERESTING DATA POINT. THE

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:18.760
SECOND DATA POINT WAS THE YOU

01:28:18.826 --> 01:28:21.696
KNOW WHO EMERGING ON HOUSE ARE

01:28:21.763 --> 01:28:24.499

NEVER BEEN ON HOUSE BEFORE. AND

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:30.071
SO I WOULD LIKE AS WE WENT TO A

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.639
QUESTIONS TO REALLY TALK ABOUT

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:32.273
SINCE THE ALL THE TO DATA

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:34.042
POINTS WHAT ARE ARE CPAS

01:28:34.108 --> 01:28:38.012
STRATEGIES TO DEALING WITH

THOSE POPULATIONS. SOME OF SAID

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:40.415
THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:41.849
DATA BUT THOUGH THE TWO DATA

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:44.018
POINTS WE NOW. AND THE NATURAL

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:46.087
QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE GOING

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:48.890

APPRECIATE THIS- AS WELL THAT

01:44:10.444 --> 01:44:14.514
WE SOMETIMES DO A BASS LINE. AT

01:44:14.581 --> 01:44:16.550
ALLOCATION FOR SOME OF OUR A

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:18.719
SMALLER COUNTIES IN IN REGIONS

TO RESOURCE THE NEED AND GIVEN

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:29.196
COMMUNITY. AT THE WILL OF THE

01:44:29.262 --> 01:44:32.265
THIS PUSH ONE MORE THAN OUT RUN

01:44:32.332 --> 01:44:33.634
I MAY HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:36.870
BACK. THE GOVERNOR ALSO HAS

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:38.972
MADE OBD. AT LEAST IN THE- PLAN

01:44:39.039 --> 01:44:42.142
AS PRESENTED TO ME. THE THERE

01:44:42.209 --> 01:44:44.277
WOULD BE- THAT AN AGGRESSIVE

01:44:44.344 --> 01:44:46.747
OF. ALL I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S A

01:44:46.813 --> 01:44:48.849
SANCTION. TO COUNTIES THAT

01:44:48.915 --> 01:44:50.751
DON'T MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF

01:44:50.817 --> 01:44:53.820
THE STATE. NOW THAT CONCERNS ME

01:44:53.887 --> 01:44:55.922
A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THE STATE

01:44:55.989 --> 01:44:58.225
IS IN NO SMALL MEASURE PARTLY

01:44:58.291 --> 01:45:00.293
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HOMELESS

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:02.396
PROBLEM. THEN I DON'T WANT TO

01:45:02.462 --> 01:45:04.498
GET INTO THAT BUT IT'S-

01:45:04.564 --> 01:45:05.065
OBLIGATED BUT IT RELATES TO

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:07.534
REALIGN. AND IT'S NOT

01:45:07.601 --> 01:45:09.770
NECESSARILY NEW IT'S XCELERATED

01:45:09.836 --> 01:45:13.006
BUT THAT SAID- I WOULD JUST

01:45:13.073 --> 01:45:15.342
HOPE THAT WE DON'T AYE AYE WHAT

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:16.677
IS AT COMMUNITIES THING LOOK

01:45:16.743 --> 01:45:18.311
LIKE IS IT INDUSTRY DETERMINE

01:45:18.378 --> 01:45:19.746
WHAT THAT WILL BE A FREE OF THE

01:45:19.813 --> 01:45:21.982
STATE DOESN'T LIKE WHAT THE

01:45:22.049 --> 01:45:23.817

WHERE AT REGIONS ARE HAVING

01:45:38.031 --> 01:45:38.565
SUCCESS AND WHERE THEY NEED

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:39.733
SUPPORT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:40.701
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT

01:53:15.021 --> 01:53:16.489
FALLING IN THE GAPS OF THERE'S

01:53:16.556 --> 01:53:18.358
NOT CLEARLY IN THAT- YOU YOU

01:53:18.424 --> 01:53:20.093

01:53:38.278 --> 01:53:40.446
DIFFERENT REASONS WHY AND I

01:53:40.513 --> 01:53:41.047

01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:45.051
AT WHAT POINT DO WE GET TO

01:53:45.118 --> 01:53:46.219
THOSE. YOU KNOW WHERE YOU

01:53:46.286 --> 01:53:47.220
ACTUALLY GET SOME THE SERVICES

PEOPLE ENTERING HOMELESSNESS

01:53:55.795 --> 01:53:58.064
SO. SO EVEN AS WE'RE TRYING TO

01:53:58.131 --> 01:54:00.033
THAT REVAMPS MEDI CAL AND DO

01:54:00.099 --> 01:54:02.135

01:55:04.297 --> 01:55:05.932
MANY DECADES LED TO THE

01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:07.867
SCARCITY WHICH ROSE THE COSTS

01:55:07.934 --> 01:55:11.404
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE. THE

01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:13.306
FACT THAT WE ARE MASS

01:55:13.373 --> 01:55:14.440
INCARCERATION SO WHEN WE LOOK

01:55:14.507 --> 01:55:15.141
AT THIS NUMBERS OF

01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:18.211
DISPROPORTIONATE IN FIVE IMPACT

01:55:18.278 --> 01:55:20.913
ON OUR BLACK POPULATION OR

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:23.249
BLACK CALIFORNIANS. THEY HAVE

01:55:23.316 --> 01:55:25.351
RECORDS AND THOSE RECORDS THEN

01:55:25.418 --> 01:55:26.786
PREVENTED THEM FOR HAVING THE

01:55:26.853 --> 01:55:28.621
TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT THAT WOULD

01:55:28.688 --> 01:55:31.190
GIVE THEM THE TYPE OF- INCOME

01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:32.725
TO REALLY AFFORD THE HOUSING

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:34.894
COSTS WE HAVE. ALSO THE KICK IT

01:55:34.961 --> 01:55:35.928
ACCESS TO A SECTION EIGHT

01:55:35.995 --> 01:55:37.764
VOUCHER DEPENDING IF WHAT KIND

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:40.300
OF RECORD THEY HALF. AN A SO

01:55:40.366 --> 01:55:43.503
ALL THOSE FACTORS- MEANWHILE

01:55:43.569 --> 01:55:45.672
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INCREASE IN

01:55:45.738 --> 01:55:48.474
SENIORS SO WE GO BACK TO THE

01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:49.876
RECESSION. THE RECESSION

01:55:49.942 --> 01:55:51.678
IMPACTED EVERYTHING MEAN THE

01:55:51.744 --> 01:55:53.279
RECESSIONS WHEN WE FIRST

01:55:53.346 --> 01:55:55.248
STARTED SEEN THE- RIGHT AFTER

01:55:55.315 --> 01:55:56.816
THE RECESSION WHICH WOULD

01:55:56.883 --> 01:55:58.851
COUPLE OF THINGS BUT THE BORDEN

01:55:58.918 --> 01:56:01.020
CARE HOMES IN S. AROSE JUST

01:56:01.087 --> 01:56:03.523
BEING WIPED OUT. SO THAT TYPE

01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:04.424
OF HOUSING THAT WAS AVAILABLE

01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:06.326
TO PEOPLE AND THEN WE HAD LOTS

01:56:06.392 --> 01:56:07.327
OF PEOPLE INCLUDING

01:56:07.393 --> 01:56:08.961
DISPROPORTIONATELY ARE BLACK

01:56:09.028 --> 01:56:11.931
RESIDENTS LOST HOMES WHICH WAS

01:56:11.998 --> 01:56:13.766
THEIR NEST EGG. AND HAVE NOT

01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:14.734
BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER FROM THAT

01:56:14.801 --> 01:56:16.736
MANY OF THEM OLDER FOR LOS

01:56:16.803 --> 01:56:19.906
RETIREMENT FUNDS SO. YOU YOU

01:56:19.972 --> 01:56:24.677
THAT'S WHAT WE SEE SOME MORE OF

01:56:24.744 --> 01:56:25.878
OUR AGING POPULATION. IN BUT

01:56:25.945 --> 01:56:27.180
HOW WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE HAD A-

01:56:27.246 --> 01:56:30.083
TO BE ABLE TO THEM THROUGH THIS.

01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:32.418
THIS TYPE OF- PRESSURES RIGHT

01:56:32.485 --> 01:56:34.487
AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT SENATOR

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:36.956
SKINNER THE WORK- UNFORTUNATE

01:56:37.023 --> 01:56:38.391
THIS LEGISLATURE DID IN TERMS

01:56:38.458 --> 01:56:39.826
OF REDUCING OUR CAL WORKS

01:56:39.892 --> 01:56:41.728
GRANTS YES SO THEY WERE IN THE

01:56:41.794 --> 01:56:42.762
NUMBER OF PUBLIC POLICY

01:56:42.829 --> 01:56:44.630
DECISIONS THAT GOT US TO WHERE

01:56:44.697 --> 01:56:46.733
WE ARE TODAY YEAH AND SO IT

01:56:46.799 --> 01:56:48.835
IT'S LIKE THIS TO TSUNAMI OF

01:56:48.901 --> 01:56:50.636
IMPACTS AND THEN MEANWHILE WE

01:56:50.703 --> 01:56:51.738
HAVE THIS ECONOMIC BOOM. AND

01:56:51.804 --> 01:56:55.041
THE- BOOM. HAS CREATED A GIVE

01:56:55.108 --> 01:56:57.210
THE SCARCITY UP. COSTS OF

01:56:57.276 --> 01:56:59.445
HOUSING BUT A CERTAIN PERCENT

01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:00.046
OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO AFFORD

01:57:00.113 --> 01:57:03.549
IT. SO IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT

01:57:03.616 --> 01:57:05.385
THEN WHOEVER OWNS THAT YOU KNOW

01:57:05.451 --> 01:57:07.620
EITHER IF YOUR LANDLORD OR THE

01:57:07.687 --> 01:57:08.187
GUY SELLING YOU'RE GOING TO

01:57:08.254 --> 01:57:10.189
SELL TO THAT. THAT PERSON WHO

01:57:10.256 --> 01:57:13.393
CAN AFFORD IT WHICH THERE IS A

01:57:13.459 --> 01:57:13.960
PERCENT OF PEOPLE CALIFORNIA

01:57:14.026 --> 01:57:15.661
YOU CAN. BUT THEN OUR WAGE

01:57:15.728 --> 01:57:17.930
GROWTH IT'S NOT BEEN ANYWHERE

01:57:17.997 --> 01:57:19.499
NEAR COMMENSURATE FOR MOST

01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:23.236
PEOPLE SO THEY THEN CAN'T. AND

01:57:23.302 --> 01:57:25.371
NOW. WE'RE DEALING WITH THE

01:57:25.438 --> 01:57:26.839
SYMPTOMS OF THE CRISIS NOW AND

01:57:26.906 --> 01:57:29.742
WE'RE DEALING WITH HOW DO WE-

01:57:29.809 --> 01:57:30.243
HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS

01:57:30.309 --> 01:57:34.547
IMMEDIATE. THIS VERY. JUST SOUL

01:57:34.614 --> 01:57:36.983
WRENCHING HEART BREAKING. EVERY

01:57:37.049 --> 01:57:39.085
TIME WE GO HOME EVERY TIME WERE

01:57:39.152 --> 01:57:40.920
EVEN IN THE CAPITAL SEEN PEOPLE

01:57:40.987 --> 01:57:43.055
IN THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE

01:57:43.122 --> 01:57:45.158
WORLD IN THE FIFTH LARGEST

01:57:45.224 --> 01:57:46.759
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WITH THIS

01:57:46.826 --> 01:57:48.094
LEVEL OF PEOPLE BEING ON OUR

01:57:48.161 --> 01:57:50.897
STREETS IN A MYSTERY AND IT'S

01:57:50.963 --> 01:57:51.697
JUST AWFUL. BUT IT. WOULD

01:57:51.764 --> 01:57:52.765
CLEARLY WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:57:52.832 --> 01:57:54.434
THESE IMMEDIATE BUT I THINK WE

01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.536
ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS OTHER

01:57:56.602 --> 01:57:58.070
STUFF OR IT'S NEVER GOING TO GO

01:57:58.137 --> 01:58:00.106
AWAY. WE GOT EVEN REMOVE THE

01:58:00.173 --> 01:58:01.774
OBSTACLES TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO

01:58:01.841 --> 01:58:03.943
HAVE THOSE RECORDS FROM BEING

01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:05.545
ABLE TO GET INTO HOUSING- GOOD

01:58:05.611 --> 01:58:08.381
GOOD JOBS. AND WE HAVE TO DEAL

01:58:08.448 --> 01:58:10.183
WITH JUST THERE'S A LOT AND

01:58:10.249 --> 01:58:12.552
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH YES

01:58:12.618 --> 01:58:14.454
SPAWNING HAS TO BE AREN'T

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.322
GOING. TO DO WITH THIS

01:58:16.389 --> 01:58:17.690
IMMEDIATE BUT WE BETTER FIX

01:58:17.757 --> 01:58:19.492
THESE OTHER STRUCTURAL THINGS

01:58:19.559 --> 01:58:20.927
HOME YOU KNOW THE TROUBLE SO

01:58:20.993 --> 01:58:22.495
NOW POLICIES FOR MY EDITORIAL

01:58:22.562 --> 01:58:26.566
BUT JUST OBSESSED CONSUMED WITH

01:58:26.632 --> 01:58:28.568
THIS FOR A LONG TIME NOW MY

01:58:28.634 --> 01:58:33.139
QUESTIONS. SO THE FIRST ONE.

01:58:33.206 --> 01:58:34.707
THE LONG TERM RENTAL SUBSIDIES

01:58:34.774 --> 01:58:36.175
HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION

01:58:36.242 --> 01:58:37.276
FOR ALL THE REASONS WE TALKED

01:58:37.343 --> 01:58:38.878
ABOUT AND WE'VE ALSO

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:40.346
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE FEDERAL

01:58:40.413 --> 01:58:41.681
WHAT WE NORMALLY USE SECTION

01:58:41.747 --> 01:58:46.385
IT'S NOT ADEQUATE SO. ARE THERE.

01:58:46.452 --> 01:58:49.188
TWO OUR TO HEAR ABOUT OBSTACLES

01:58:49.255 --> 01:58:50.389
THAT ARE KEEPING US FROM USING

01:58:50.456 --> 01:58:52.625
THOSE MY UNDERSTANDING FOR

01:58:52.692 --> 01:58:55.027
EXAMPLE FROM SOME PROVIDERS IS

01:58:55.094 --> 01:58:57.663
THAT ARE THAT CERTAIN OF OUR

01:58:57.730 --> 01:58:58.664
MONEY WAS TIED TO THE HIGH

01:58:58.731 --> 01:59:01.200
DEFINITION. OF LIKE IMMINENTLY

01:59:01.267 --> 01:59:03.369
HOMELESS AND THAT DOUBTS YOU

01:59:03.436 --> 01:59:05.771
HAVE TO BE HOMELESS WITHIN

01:59:05.838 --> 01:59:07.340
FOURTEEN DAYS AND THERE'S A SET

01:59:07.406 --> 01:59:09.242
OF VERY LARGE SET OF PEOPLE

01:59:09.308 --> 01:59:11.310
THAT NEED. THIS TYPE OF HOUSING

01:59:11.377 --> 01:59:14.113
SUBSIDY WHO ARE NOT NECESSARILY

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:14.614
GOING TO BE HOMELESS IN

01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:17.183
FOURTEEN DAYS. BUT MAYBE THEY

01:59:17.250 --> 01:59:18.584
WILL BE IN THREE MONTHS OR

01:59:18.651 --> 01:59:21.487
WHATEVER SO IS THAT IT OBSTACLE

01:59:21.554 --> 01:59:23.523
DO WE NEED TO FIX THAT AND

01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:25.758
WHAT. OBSTACLES ARE WE

01:59:25.825 --> 01:59:28.528
EXPERIENCING IN TERMS OF TWO TO

01:59:28.594 --> 01:59:32.732
PROVIDE AT PREVENT GEN I. THAT

01:59:32.798 --> 01:59:35.535
FIND. TO MY FIRST QUESTION.

01:59:35.601 --> 01:59:38.304
REGARDING THE OBSTACLES AROUND

01:59:38.371 --> 01:59:38.838
THE FEDERAL RESOURCES THE

01:59:38.905 --> 01:59:40.506
PRIMARY THING THAT WE SEE IN LA

01:59:40.573 --> 01:59:42.775
COUNTY IN UTILIZING OUR

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:44.043
RESOURCES IN ADDITION TO JUST

01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:45.044
MAKING SURE RECORD DATING IN

01:59:45.111 --> 01:59:47.013
THE RIGHT WAY IS THE RATE AT

01:59:47.079 --> 01:59:48.848
WHICH THE REIMBURSEMENT OCCURS

01:59:48.915 --> 01:59:51.651
RELATIVE TO THE COST OF LIVING-

01:59:51.717 --> 01:59:53.519
SO THE VOUCHER PAYS IS NOT

01:59:53.586 --> 01:59:55.488
COMMENSURATE WITH THE AVERAGE

01:59:55.555 --> 01:59:57.290
COST OF LIVING IN LA OR THE

01:59:57.356 --> 01:59:59.125
COST OF THE UNIT OR RENT IN LA

01:59:59.191 --> 02:00:01.460
SO JUST IS NOT COMPETITIVE. IN

02:00:01.527 --> 02:00:02.895
THE RENTAL MARKET. THE FEDERAL

02:00:02.962 --> 02:00:05.131
YOU KNOW LIMITATION ANSWER WE

02:00:05.197 --> 02:00:06.832
IS OUR FINING TRYING TO MAKE UP

02:00:06.899 --> 02:00:09.268
FOR THAT. ADDING TO OKAY SO

02:00:09.335 --> 02:00:11.103
THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO BUT YEAH

02:00:11.170 --> 02:00:12.138
I THINK THAT'S- CERTAINLY

02:00:12.204 --> 02:00:14.640
BARRIER- I THINK THAT DOUBLES

02:00:14.707 --> 02:00:16.309
LHASA AND- LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT

02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.455
INSPECTION AND THAT THAT THE

02:02:09.522 --> 02:02:10.890
THERE'S A BROKEN WINDOW OR

02:02:10.956 --> 02:02:12.692
SOMETHING IS WRONG OUR FUNDING

02:02:12.758 --> 02:02:15.027
IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE

02:02:15.094 --> 02:02:15.628
TO FIX THAT. AND GET SOMEBODY

02:02:15.695 --> 02:02:17.730
INTO USE SO I WOULD SAY THAT.

02:02:17.797 --> 02:02:19.699
IT WORKING AROUND HAD

02:02:19.765 --> 02:02:20.900
DEFINITIONS AND HIDE

02:02:20.966 --> 02:02:22.501
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND

HAD RESTRICTIONS. WITH ARE

02:02:24.236 --> 02:02:26.305
FINDING LOCALLY- I DON'T

02:02:26.372 --> 02:02:27.873
BELIEVE THAT A SORT OF OUR OUR

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:29.775
FUNDING DEFINITION RIGHT NOW IS.

02:02:29.842 --> 02:02:31.477
FOR OUR OUR OWN DEFINITION OF

02:02:31.544 --> 02:02:33.512
HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW IS THAT

02:02:33.579 --> 02:02:35.081
IS THAT. EVEN IN THE TOP TEN OF

02:02:35.147 --> 02:02:36.082
THE OF THE ISSUES WERE WERE

02:02:36.148 --> 02:02:39.085
SAYING. AND IF I COULD ADD FROM

02:02:39.151 --> 02:02:39.852
ABOUT YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHEN

YOU'RE SWIMMING VOUCHERS ARE

02:02:40.519 --> 02:02:41.887
AVAILABLE. HOUSING AUTHORITIES

02:02:41.954 --> 02:02:44.256
ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOVERNED BY

02:02:44.323 --> 02:02:45.524
CITIES AND COUNTIES MANY TIMES

02:02:45.591 --> 02:02:48.794
THERE AND- BODIES. ALSO YOU

ON THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IS

02:02:51.464 --> 02:02:53.099
THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

02:02:53.165 --> 02:02:55.668
OPEN UP THEIR WAITING LIST-

02:02:55.735 --> 02:02:57.503

02:02:57.570 --> 02:03:00.272
BERNIE DINOS- THEY IT WAS SEVEN

02:03:00.339 --> 02:03:01.907
YEARS. THEY DRESS RECENTLY

THE WAITING LIST THE WAY HAD

02:03:06.112 --> 02:03:08.013
ALSO MANAGES THEIR PLANS. IS

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:09.181
YOU HAVE TO PICK PEOPLE FROM

02:03:09.248 --> 02:03:10.716
THE WAITING LIST SO IF YOU'RE

02:03:10.783 --> 02:03:12.852
HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE NOT ON THE

02:03:12.918 --> 02:03:14.987
WAITING LIST AND YOU'RE TRYING

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:18.090
TO DO TENANTS BASED ALTERS. IT

02:03:18.157 --> 02:03:20.059
SOME MORE THE OTHER. WHEN

02:03:20.126 --> 02:03:24.430
RELATIONSHIPS. RELY PART OUT.

02:03:24.497 --> 02:03:27.633
SO AM I THANK THIS TALK ABOUT

02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:30.302
PROJECT SPONSORED. MISSION IS

02:03:30.369 --> 02:03:33.339
SHE- OUR- WHAT. TO ALLOW PUT

02:03:33.405 --> 02:03:35.941
THAT PRICE FOR THE NEW UNITS IN

02:03:36.008 --> 02:03:36.876
A EITHER TO PER OR POTENTIALLY

02:03:36.942 --> 02:03:38.477
PER AND I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE

02:03:38.544 --> 02:03:40.913
IT IN RELATIONSHIP TO HELP OUR

02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:41.981
TROOPS COULD BE DEPLOYED IT'S

02:03:42.047 --> 02:03:45.484
HAS DEFINITION OF A UNIT ROOM

02:03:45.551 --> 02:03:46.819
EIGHT AN AT AND ONE OF THE

02:03:46.886 --> 02:03:48.454
POINTS THAT I TALKED ABOUT WAS

02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:50.322
THE LOWERING OF CONSTRUCTION

02:03:50.389 --> 02:03:51.891
COSTS SOME THAT BECAUSE

02:03:51.957 --> 02:03:54.059
POLICIES SET UP. USING FAT

02:03:54.126 --> 02:03:56.796
RESOURCES OTHERS FROM HATS

02:03:56.862 --> 02:03:58.898
PERSPECTIVE A UNIT PASSED TO

02:03:58.964 --> 02:04:02.134
HAVE TO USE A VOUCHER HAS TO

02:04:02.201 --> 02:04:04.970
HAVE A BATHROOM AND A KITCHEN.

02:04:05.037 --> 02:04:06.105
YEAH WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT AND

02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:07.740
MANY AGENCIES- ARE LOOKING OUT

02:04:07.807 --> 02:04:09.341
MY CAR COUNTY ARE THERE OTHER

THERE. TO BRING OUR

02:04:12.912 --> 02:04:14.513
CONSTRUCTION COSTS DOWN BECAUSE

02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:16.615
THAT'S ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION

02:04:16.682 --> 02:04:17.883
AND THE OTHER FLIPSIDE IS HOW

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:18.951
TO WILL LINE THE RENTAL

02:04:19.018 --> 02:04:21.153
RESOURCE THAT'S OUT THERE AND

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:22.288
WHERE THEY'RE DISCONNECTS

02:04:22.354 --> 02:04:24.356
BETWEEN FINANCING AND BETWEEN

02:04:24.423 --> 02:04:26.725
REGULATIONS IN BETWEEN POLICIES

02:04:26.792 --> 02:04:28.427
AN APPLICATION. SO JUST TO KIND

02:04:28.494 --> 02:04:29.995
OF BE AWARE FROM WHAT WAS

02:04:30.062 --> 02:04:32.398
DESCRIBED BY EVERYBODY RELATIVE

02:04:32.464 --> 02:04:34.033
VALUE IN MARKET THERE'S

02:04:34.099 --> 02:04:35.835
PROCESSES AND ULTIMATELY THE

02:04:35.901 --> 02:04:37.002
INITIATIVE DEPLOYMENT OF THE

02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:39.538
POUCH. IN IF I COULD ADD ONE

02:04:39.605 --> 02:04:41.407
MORE COMMENT ON A POSITIVE NOTE

02:04:41.473 --> 02:04:44.009
WHICH IS THAT- AS DIFFICULT

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:45.878
MEAN USING A LOCAL FLEXIBLE

02:04:45.945 --> 02:04:49.181
SUBSIDY IS SO MUCH MORE

02:04:49.248 --> 02:04:50.449
POWERFUL AND EASIER TO WORK

02:04:50.516 --> 02:04:51.717
WITH DâN A FEDERAL SUBSIDY

02:04:51.784 --> 02:04:54.787
HAVING SAID THAT IF THERE IS AN

02:04:54.854 --> 02:04:56.255
INFRASTRUCTURE IF THERE IS

02:04:56.322 --> 02:04:58.657
CAPACITY BILL FOR LANDLORD

02:04:58.724 --> 02:05:00.226
ENGAGEMENT RENT SUBSIDY AND

02:05:00.292 --> 02:05:02.328
PENDENCY SUPPORTS. AS HAS BEEN

02:05:02.394 --> 02:05:03.629
BUILT UP IN CORNERS AND SOME

02:05:03.696 --> 02:05:04.597
OTHER AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE

02:05:04.663 --> 02:05:07.199
THEN WITHIN THAT IT IS POSSIBLE

02:05:07.266 --> 02:05:08.934
YOU HAVE DEDICATED TEAMS THAT

02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:10.436
BRIEF PROBLEM SOMETHING AROUND

02:05:10.502 --> 02:05:12.671
HOW TO UTILIZE DIFFERENT TYPES

02:05:12.738 --> 02:05:13.772
OF SUBSIDIES HOW TO ENGAGE

02:05:13.839 --> 02:05:16.408
LANDLORDS DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITY

02:05:16.475 --> 02:05:18.344
SO BY INVESTING IN MAC A CITY

02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:20.246
WITH A CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO

02:05:20.312 --> 02:05:22.181
HAVE FUN WITH RENT SUBSIDIES

02:05:22.248 --> 02:05:24.650
EMBEDDED IN IT YOU WILL OVER

02:05:24.717 --> 02:05:27.353
TIME I THINK IN A BILL AT A

02:05:27.419 --> 02:05:30.122
STATE UTILIZED. ABLE FEDERAL

02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:31.290
REESE INCLUDING SITE EIGHT

02:05:31.357 --> 02:05:34.126
DOCTORS. SERVE COUPLE MORE

02:05:34.193 --> 02:05:36.829
QUESTIONS ON OBSTACLES ON THE

02:05:36.896 --> 02:05:40.666
OTHER ONE IS SO WE SEE THIS AS

02:05:40.733 --> 02:05:42.801
A LOT OF WARDEN CORONAS ARE

02:05:42.868 --> 02:05:45.004
LEAST ENTITIES NOT THEY DON'T

02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:46.272
OWN AND SO THEN OF COURSE IF

02:05:46.338 --> 02:05:49.241
THE OWNER DECIDES TO CONVERT.

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:51.076
BUT WE'VE ON. THE REAL QUESTION

02:05:51.143 --> 02:05:53.679
IS THERE ARE THERE ARE

02:05:53.746 --> 02:05:55.948
POTENTIAL UNITS AVAILABLE

02:05:56.015 --> 02:05:57.883
WHETHER IT'S VACANT HOMES OR

02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:59.818
BOARD AND CARE OR MOTELS ARE

02:05:59.885 --> 02:06:01.153
VERY STE THINGS BUT THEY WOULD

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:03.122
NEED TO BE PURCHASED FOR US TO.

02:06:03.188 --> 02:06:05.291
TO UTILIZE IMPROPERLY ARE THERE

02:06:05.357 --> 02:06:07.459
OBSTACLES IN TERMS OF OUR STATE

02:06:07.526 --> 02:06:09.128
FUNDING FOR THE ABILITY TO

02:06:09.194 --> 02:06:11.664
PURCHASE. WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO

02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:15.734
MAKE THAT POTENTIALLY EASIER.

02:06:15.801 --> 02:06:17.736
BECAUSE THAT SECURES IT COULD

02:06:17.803 --> 02:06:20.072
SECURE PROPERTIES THEN FOR LONG

02:06:20.139 --> 02:06:21.340
TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE

02:06:21.407 --> 02:06:22.775
DON'T HAVE TO BUILD FROM

02:06:22.841 --> 02:06:23.242
SCRATCH WHICH IS QUITE

02:06:23.309 --> 02:06:26.779
EXPENSIVE. IF THERE ARE ANY

02:06:26.845 --> 02:06:29.815
THAT'S GREAT BUT- I HEAR FROM

02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:31.750
PROVIDERS THAT THERE ARE SO I'M

02:06:31.817 --> 02:06:40.359
JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. SO

02:06:40.426 --> 02:06:42.127
I'LL SAY ON THIS ONE I MAY HAVE

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:42.962

TO LINGO ASSOCIATED WITH. ALL

02:09:15.681 --> 02:09:17.149
THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HEALTH

02:09:17.216 --> 02:09:18.784
AND HUMAN SERVICES. IT WHEN

02:09:18.851 --> 02:09:21.887
CONNECTING DIFFERENT SERVICES A

02:09:21.954 --> 02:09:23.388
LOT OF TIMES SMALLER MEDIUM

02:09:23.455 --> 02:09:24.656
CITIES. DON'T KNOW RESOURCE

02:09:24.723 --> 02:09:28.327
THERE. AS WE AS THE STATE HAS

02:09:28.393 --> 02:09:30.362
STARTED ON THE PROCESS. WE WITH

02:09:30.429 --> 02:09:32.231
I THINK KEEP AND HOPS ON THE

02:09:32.297 --> 02:09:34.766
REGIONAL THE REGIONAL PLANTS IT

02:09:34.833 --> 02:09:36.668
IT STARTS PULLING THE CITY'S

02:09:36.735 --> 02:09:38.170
MORE INTO THE TABLE PARTICULIER

02:09:38.237 --> 02:09:39.238
SMALLER CITIES ARE LARGER

02:09:39.304 --> 02:09:40.906
CITIES THEY HAVE MORE

02:09:40.973 --> 02:09:42.608
CONNECTIVITY TO YOUR COUNTIES

02:09:42.674 --> 02:09:44.443
MOST OF THE MAJORITY OF YOUR

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:46.812
CITIES REALLY DON'T KNOW THESE

02:09:46.879 --> 02:09:48.814
TERMINOLOGIES AND WHAT'S THERE

02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:50.616
AND AT THAT SERVICES PROVIDED.

02:09:50.682 --> 02:09:51.216
I THINK SOME OF THE POSITIVE

02:09:51.283 --> 02:09:52.518
ABOUT THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER

02:09:52.584 --> 02:09:54.553
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IS THE

02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:56.188
OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT BUT

02:09:56.255 --> 02:09:58.590
DON'T ASSUME ALL OF THOSE

02:09:58.657 --> 02:09:59.691
STOCKS CONNECTED TODAY AND

02:09:59.758 --> 02:10:02.427
THERE'S GREATER OPPORTUNITY

02:10:02.494 --> 02:10:04.630
SUCH AS- AS THE NEXT DAY EVEN

02:10:04.696 --> 02:10:06.098
NOW THEY STOOD BEFORE YEARS AGO

02:10:06.165 --> 02:10:09.168
QUITE BRIGHT. SOUND JULY

02:10:09.234 --> 02:10:11.170
QUESTIONS ANOTHER ONE IS THAT

02:10:11.236 --> 02:10:13.338
WE'VE SEEING CITIES NOW I THINK

02:10:13.405 --> 02:10:15.107
SENATORS GOES DOWN THIS OTHERS.

02:10:15.174 --> 02:10:17.209
WHO ARE PASSING LAWS TO GIVE

02:10:17.276 --> 02:10:19.278
THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO

02:10:19.344 --> 02:10:21.880
TENANTS IN CERTAIN CASES. WE

02:10:21.947 --> 02:10:25.350
ALREADY HAD BELIEVE FORECLOSURE

02:10:25.417 --> 02:10:27.119
WE HAD SOME SOME PROVISIONS

02:10:27.186 --> 02:10:29.721
LIKE THAT. AND NOW THESE

02:10:29.788 --> 02:10:33.959
TENANTS ART. ALL NECESSARILY ON

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:34.560
THE BRINK OF BECOMING HOMELESS

02:10:34.626 --> 02:10:36.361
IF THEY HAPPEN TO BE FACED WITH

02:10:36.428 --> 02:10:38.764
A LIVING IN A PROPERTY DEBTS

02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:39.865
FOR CLOTHES BUT THE COULD BE

02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:41.867
YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THOSE. AND

02:10:41.934 --> 02:10:43.435
I'M MY QUESTION IS NOT SO MUCH

02:10:43.502 --> 02:10:46.205
WHETHER THIS FUNDING. IS

02:10:46.271 --> 02:10:48.840
AVAILABLE SAY FOR THAT TYPE OF

02:10:48.907 --> 02:10:51.310
PURPOSE BUT RATHER. DO WE HAVE.

02:10:51.376 --> 02:10:54.580
IN DO WE HAVE REVOLVING LOAN

02:10:54.646 --> 02:10:56.114
FUNDS DO WE HAVE OTHER SOURCES

02:10:56.181 --> 02:10:59.218
OF FUNDS THAT MIGHT ENABLE

02:10:59.284 --> 02:11:00.652
EITHER OUR COMMUNITY LAND

02:11:00.719 --> 02:11:02.621
TRUSTS ARE NON PROFITS FOR OUR

02:11:02.688 --> 02:11:06.124
TENANTS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS

02:11:06.191 --> 02:11:07.426
BECAUSE THIS KIND OF CAPITALS

02:11:07.492 --> 02:11:09.962
HARD SOMETIMES TO ACCESS SO

02:11:10.028 --> 02:11:11.830
THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:11:11.897 --> 02:11:13.198
TO BUY EITHER A FORECLOSED

02:11:13.265 --> 02:11:16.435
PROPERTY FOR. OTHER PROPERTIES

02:11:16.501 --> 02:11:18.303
THAT ARE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES

02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:20.038
DO WE HAVE ANY SOURCES OF FUNDS

02:11:20.105 --> 02:11:25.410
LIKE DONE THE STATE. SO I CAN

02:11:25.477 --> 02:11:26.812
SPEAK A LITTLE BIT INTO THEIR

02:11:26.878 --> 02:11:28.513
VARIOUS HOUSING AND HOME

02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:30.482
RELATED ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS-

02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:31.850
ONE THING THAT'S MAYBE A CHASE

02:11:31.917 --> 02:11:32.818
INTO THE QUESTION THAT YOU

02:11:32.884 --> 02:11:34.686
MENTION IS WHEN IT COMES FOR

02:11:34.753 --> 02:11:36.121
LEGAL ASSISTANCE WHICH IS

02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:37.522
OFFICE IN DIFFERENT COMPONENT

02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:38.457
OF PEOPLE DEALING WITH

02:11:38.523 --> 02:11:40.692
ADDICTION BUT WHAT YOU DESCRIBE

02:11:40.759 --> 02:11:42.361
IS ALSO A FORM OF UNIT. BUT

02:11:42.427 --> 02:11:46.832
FORM OF EIGHT. BUDGET ENACTED

02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:50.068
FUNDING FOR THAT AND THEN ONE

02:11:50.135 --> 02:11:51.603
OTHER PROGRAM AND I WAS LEGAL

02:11:51.670 --> 02:11:53.138
ASSISTANCE RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT

02:11:53.205 --> 02:11:54.840
AND NOW WE'RE WORKING ON THE

02:11:54.906 --> 02:11:55.440
NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT

02:11:55.507 --> 02:11:57.876
MONEY- BUT IN TERMS OF THE

02:11:57.943 --> 02:11:59.311

HOLES. THINK OF A LOT OF ROOM

02:12:06.485 --> 02:12:07.152
FOR ME TO PUT ANY IN PRIORITY

02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:09.488
BUT CLEARLY WE HAVE. IN

02:12:09.554 --> 02:12:12.257
ADDITION TO THE GROWTH IN. ON

02:12:12.324 --> 02:12:14.593
BLACK POPULATION BEING HOMELESS

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:17.629
AN AGING IS CHILDREN. AND YOU

SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE

02:12:37.683 --> 02:12:39.618
FOCUSED ON THAT THAT'S THE CAO

02:12:39.685 --> 02:12:41.386
WORKS HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM.

02:12:41.453 --> 02:12:43.021

THE REGIONS ARE GONNA BE

02:19:53.618 --> 02:19:55.453
DEFINED AND- HOW FUNDING IS

02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:56.387

THINGS. IT IT IT ALMOST FEELS A

02:20:05.497 --> 02:20:06.197
LITTLE LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO

02:20:06.264 --> 02:20:07.198
BUILD THE PLANE WHILE IT'S IN

02:20:07.265 --> 02:20:09.200
THE AIR AYE AYE YOU KNOW SO. I

02:20:09.267 --> 02:20:10.935
LIKE TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF

02:20:11.002 --> 02:20:13.138
WHERE THIS FITS INTO ALL OF THE

02:20:13.204 --> 02:20:14.272
WORK THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENED

02:20:14.339 --> 02:20:15.540
AND THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE

02:20:15.607 --> 02:20:19.611
THE LOCAL LEVEL- I APPRECIATE

02:20:19.677 --> 02:20:23.548
THE- THIS IS SEEMS TO BE A- AN

02:20:23.615 --> 02:20:25.450
AGGRESSIVE OWNERSHIP OF THE

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:26.885
GOVERNOR'S TAKING OVER OVER

02:20:26.951 --> 02:20:28.953
THIS ENORMOUS ISSUE- BUT IS

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:30.522
THIS IS THIS THE RIGHT WAY TO

02:20:30.588 --> 02:20:32.657
DO IT ON THIS TIME FRAME- THOSE

02:20:32.724 --> 02:20:34.125
ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I

02:20:34.192 --> 02:20:35.660
THINK THE LA- BROUGHT BRINGS UP

02:20:35.727 --> 02:20:37.328
IN ITS REPORT I JUST LOVE SOME.

02:20:37.395 --> 02:20:39.998
SOME DIRECT ANSWERS TO AYE

02:20:40.064 --> 02:20:45.637
CONCERNS FROM FOLKS. I SENATOR

02:20:45.703 --> 02:20:47.305
ALLEN- VEGAS WOULD OFTEN FROM

02:20:47.372 --> 02:20:48.706
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'M

02:20:48.773 --> 02:20:50.008
HAPPY TO SPEAK- BRIEFLY ABOUT

02:20:50.074 --> 02:20:51.409
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND THEN

02:20:51.476 --> 02:20:52.410
MY COLLEAGUES MAY WANT TO WEIGH

02:20:52.477 --> 02:20:54.245
IN AS WELL. I THINK THE FIRST

02:20:54.312 --> 02:20:55.914
AND MOST IMPORTANT THING IS

02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:58.349
WITH HE'D BEEN HAPPY TO THOSE

02:20:58.416 --> 02:20:59.651
INVESTMENTS AS DESCRIBED IN

02:20:59.717 --> 02:21:00.585
THIS HEARING A LOT OF THAT

02:21:00.652 --> 02:21:01.352
FUNDING IS JUST DURING THE

02:21:01.419 --> 02:21:02.987
GROUND RIGHT NOW SO WE ARE WAYS

02:21:03.054 --> 02:21:05.590
ARE FOCUSED ON. MAKING SURE

02:21:05.657 --> 02:21:06.157
THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING

02:21:06.224 --> 02:21:07.826
USED EFFECTIVELY I THINK WHEN

02:21:07.892 --> 02:21:09.727
IT COMES TO THE PACIFIC OPPOSE

02:21:09.794 --> 02:21:11.462
ALL- LIKE YOU MENTIONED AND

02:21:11.529 --> 02:21:12.363
MIKE THE GOVERNOR SAID IN THE

02:21:12.430 --> 02:21:14.098
STATE OF STATE. EVERYONE IS

02:21:14.165 --> 02:21:17.435
PATIENT AND EVERYONE'S ACT AS

02:21:17.502 --> 02:21:18.970
SOON AS POSSIBLE AND WHEN IT

02:21:19.037 --> 02:21:19.904
COMES TO THAT CALIFORNIA ACCESS

02:21:19.971 --> 02:21:22.440
TO HOUSING FOR. CERVICAL THE

02:21:22.507 --> 02:21:24.075
TWO MAJOR. ARE TO. MOVE PEOPLE

02:21:24.142 --> 02:21:25.543
OFF THIS. AND INTO HOUSING AND

02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:26.578
DEVELOP MORE THOSE HOUSING

02:21:26.644 --> 02:21:28.012
UNITS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:21:28.079 --> 02:21:29.581
THAT THE PROGRAM. IS INTEGRATED

02:21:29.647 --> 02:21:30.849
WITH ALL THE OTHER SOCIAL

02:21:30.915 --> 02:21:32.550
SERVICES AND SERVICES THAT THE

02:21:32.617 --> 02:21:33.985
STATE IS PROVIDING AND THAT THE

02:21:34.052 --> 02:21:35.320
COUNTIES AND THE CITIES ARE

02:21:35.386 --> 02:21:36.354
PROVIDING. BUT WE THOUGHT WITH

02:21:36.421 --> 02:21:37.488
THIS ONE TIME SEVEN HUNDRED

02:21:37.555 --> 02:21:38.723
FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FUND. PUT

02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:39.624
IT RIGHT IN THE TENS OF THOSE

02:21:39.691 --> 02:21:41.826
TWO PURPOSES WAY OUT THREE VERY

02:21:41.893 --> 02:21:43.428
CLEAR OBJECTIVES IN TERMS OF

02:21:43.494 --> 02:21:45.897
HOW THE MONIES. AND I THINK THE

02:21:45.964 --> 02:21:47.699
BROADER. FRAME FOR IT THAT IS

02:21:47.765 --> 02:21:49.934
TWO FOLD WOW FOR. LOCATION OF

02:21:50.001 --> 02:21:51.836
APPROACH. CONTINUE ACCOUNTED.

02:21:51.903 --> 02:21:53.605
PATRICK'S AND THEN THE SECOND

02:21:53.671 --> 02:21:55.840
THING IS RECOGNIZING. I THINK

02:21:55.907 --> 02:21:57.242
IN SOME THE QUESTIONS ABILITY

02:21:57.308 --> 02:21:58.376
TO THIS WHEN WE HAVE ALL THESE

02:21:58.443 --> 02:21:59.244
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND POTS OF

02:21:59.310 --> 02:22:01.646
MONEY- AND THEN WE- HAVE SO

02:22:01.713 --> 02:22:02.981
MUCH OF THE FUNDING BY SPECIFIC

02:22:03.047 --> 02:22:04.549
FORMULA. IT BECOMES A LITTLE

02:22:04.616 --> 02:22:05.717
BIT OF THE FUNDING HERE A

02:22:05.783 --> 02:22:06.618
LITTLE BIT OF THE FUNDING

02:22:06.684 --> 02:22:08.620
THERE. AND SO. I THINK EVERYONE

02:22:08.686 --> 02:22:10.288
RECOGNIZES THAT A NEW APPROACH

02:22:10.355 --> 02:22:11.923
IS NEEDED AND SO. THIS IS THE

02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:12.991
ADMINISTRATION'S BEST BET FOR

02:22:13.057 --> 02:22:14.859
HOW THAT CAN GO BUT WE ALSO

02:22:14.926 --> 02:22:16.761
KNOW THAT WE NEED TO. WORK WITH

02:22:16.828 --> 02:22:17.762
THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT IN

02:22:17.829 --> 02:22:19.430
TERMS OF. OUR FIGHTING ALL THE

02:22:19.497 --> 02:22:21.466
DETAILS TO GET EVERYTHING RIGHT

02:22:21.532 --> 02:22:22.967
BECAUSE IT IS NEW. AND THEN I

02:22:23.034 --> 02:22:23.968
THINK THE LAST THING THAT I.

02:22:24.035 --> 02:22:27.038
SAY IS THIS IS ONE TIME FIND.

02:22:27.105 --> 02:22:28.673
AS DISCUSSED. DURING I THINK

02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:29.807
EVERYONE AT THE TABLE AND

02:22:29.874 --> 02:22:31.276
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ONE

02:22:31.342 --> 02:22:33.278
TO IDENTIFY AN ONGOING SOURCE

02:22:33.344 --> 02:22:39.751
OF FUNDING. AND I THINK AS THE

02:22:39.817 --> 02:22:41.686
MATCH CONTAINS. I'M SORRY.

02:22:41.753 --> 02:22:42.787
WE'LL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF

02:22:42.854 --> 02:22:43.621
WHAT YOUR PRO IS A REAL MOVING

02:22:43.688 --> 02:22:44.956
THE BILL AND WHERE WE SHOULD BE

02:22:45.023 --> 02:22:45.690
TO THAT I CAN MY CONCERN IS

02:22:45.757 --> 02:22:46.958
BECAUSE ON GOING FIGHT IS ONE

02:22:47.025 --> 02:22:48.626
TIME FINDING AND YOUR CREATING

02:22:48.693 --> 02:22:50.461
THIS WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE TAKE

02:22:50.528 --> 02:22:54.165
IT IS THAT YOU KNOW I GUESS

02:22:54.232 --> 02:22:54.766
THAT MAKES THAT MAKES ME EXTRA

02:22:54.832 --> 02:22:55.400
NERVOUS. IF WAS BILL IF THIS IS

02:22:55.466 --> 02:22:56.901
A LONG TERM COMMITMENT. WE

02:22:56.968 --> 02:22:58.503
DECIDED AND COURTNEY DID

02:22:58.569 --> 02:22:59.637
STRATEGIC MANNER THAT WE ARE

02:22:59.704 --> 02:23:00.738
GOING TO BUILD THIS WHOLE NEW

02:23:00.805 --> 02:23:01.839
INFRASTRUCTURE THIS IS GOING TO

02:23:01.906 --> 02:23:03.074
BE THE NEW WAY. FOR US TO

02:23:03.141 --> 02:23:04.609
APPROACH HER. OUR REGIONAL AND

02:23:04.676 --> 02:23:06.544
LOCAL AND- STATEWIDE NEEDS. IT

02:23:06.611 --> 02:23:07.912
THAT WAY I WOULD FEEL BETTER

02:23:07.979 --> 02:23:10.615
BUT BUT- IT. SHOULD ONE TIME

02:23:10.682 --> 02:23:13.518
FINDING GO TOWARD THE EXISTING

02:23:13.584 --> 02:23:15.386
SUCCESSFUL INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I

02:23:15.453 --> 02:23:17.155
THINK THAT THE KEY THING HERE

02:23:17.221 --> 02:23:21.359
FOR THIS IS A WE WANT TO MAKE

02:23:21.426 --> 02:23:22.927
SURE THAT THOSE METRICS AND

02:23:22.994 --> 02:23:24.128
THEY ARE IN THE TRAILER BILL.

02:23:24.195 --> 02:23:24.862
ARE VERY CLEAR SO. CERTAINLY

02:23:24.929 --> 02:23:28.032
THE- TAKEN. WILL BUY YOU WAITED

02:23:28.099 --> 02:23:28.599
FOR THE PURPOSE OF FIND OF

02:23:28.666 --> 02:23:29.300
WHETHER WE'RE ACHIEVING THOSE

02:23:29.367 --> 02:23:31.202
TARGETS THAT ARE SET OUT IN THE

02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:35.340
TRAILER BILL. YEAH WELL. OKAY I

02:23:35.406 --> 02:23:36.507
CANNOT FOLLOW UP ON YOUR POINT

02:23:36.574 --> 02:23:38.309
BEFORE YOU GO ON DID THIS I'M

02:23:38.376 --> 02:23:40.144
SITTING HERE LOOKING AT- THE

02:23:40.211 --> 02:23:41.012
SACRAMENTO REPRESENTATIVE

02:23:41.079 --> 02:23:42.747
HAVING HEARD. THE WONDERFUL

02:23:42.814 --> 02:23:44.148
WORK THEY'VE DONE WITH HE BEEN

02:23:44.215 --> 02:23:46.384
HAPPENED I'M WONDERING SO THAT

02:23:46.451 --> 02:23:51.456
ENDS. HOW YOU GUYS BRIDGE MINE

02:23:51.522 --> 02:23:53.057
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAPPENS TO

02:23:53.124 --> 02:23:54.959
THE SACRAMENTO EXAMPLE WE HEARD

02:23:55.026 --> 02:23:57.628
TODAY WELL FIRST A WE'RE GONNA

02:23:57.695 --> 02:23:59.163
BE MINE IN MONITORING HOW THAT

02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:00.365
FUNDING IS BEING USED TO THAT'S

02:24:00.431 --> 02:24:01.733
FINE THAT SENATE FUNDING IS

02:24:01.799 --> 02:24:03.534
BEING SPENT THIS YEAR I THINK

02:24:03.601 --> 02:24:06.004
SECOND- THAT MONEY WAS ALSO ONE

02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:07.205
TIME FUNDING IN THE BUDGET THE

02:24:07.271 --> 02:24:08.206
LAST TWO YEARS IT DOESN'T MEAN

02:24:08.272 --> 02:24:10.308
THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES- NEED

02:24:10.375 --> 02:24:12.377
MORE ASSISTANCE I THINK A

02:24:12.443 --> 02:24:14.345
NUMBER THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE

02:24:14.412 --> 02:24:16.014
WORKING ON. A RECOGNIZED PRICE

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:17.448
THEY ALL NEED FOR A SIX YOU

02:24:17.515 --> 02:24:17.982
KNOW WE WANT TO FIND WAYS

02:24:18.049 --> 02:24:19.584
WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE

02:24:19.650 --> 02:24:21.386
BUDGET THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE

02:24:21.452 --> 02:24:22.854
TO DIRECT RESOURCES IN THE

02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:24.088
RIGHT WAY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:24:24.155 --> 02:24:25.690
REASONS THAT GOVERNOR- MADE SO

02:24:25.757 --> 02:24:27.525
CLEAR IN THE STATE OF THE STATE

02:24:27.592 --> 02:24:29.160
THAT WE NEED TO FIND A STABLE

02:24:29.227 --> 02:24:31.496
ON GOING REVENUE SOURCE. HAS

02:24:31.562 --> 02:24:32.463
AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHERE

02:24:32.530 --> 02:24:35.800
UNDER SHOULD GO BUT CERTAIN.

02:24:35.867 --> 02:24:36.401
KEY ACTORS AT THE TABLE. AND

02:24:36.467 --> 02:24:38.536
ALL A PART POLLUTION. I THINK

02:24:38.603 --> 02:24:39.103
REALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THIS

02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:41.172
FINE AN THE REQUEST FOR EARLY

02:24:41.239 --> 02:24:42.240
ACTION. IT'S MORE THE SENSE

02:24:42.306 --> 02:24:43.708
THAT WE CAN'T WAIT AND WHICH IS

02:24:43.775 --> 02:24:45.309
WHY EVEN THOUGH THE PROBLEM IS

02:24:45.376 --> 02:24:46.477
FAST AND A NUMBER OF WAYS YOU

02:24:46.544 --> 02:24:47.512
CAN APPROACH IT ARE PRETTY

02:24:47.578 --> 02:24:49.313
FAST. WE WANTED TO CONFINE THE

02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:50.681
FINE TO ADD VERY SPECIFIC

02:24:50.748 --> 02:24:52.650
OBJECTIVES VERY SPECIFIC SET OF

02:24:52.717 --> 02:24:53.985
SOLUTIONS. AND I GET THE

02:24:54.052 --> 02:24:56.154
CONCERNED ABOUT ONE TIME FIVE.

AND YOU KNOW THE MONEY GOES OUT

02:24:56.954 --> 02:24:59.323
THE DOOR AND THEN. WHAT HAPPENS

02:24:59.390 --> 02:25:00.258
TO IT. BUT VERY CLEAR PATRICK

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:02.994
ON IT WOULD BE OF. BEFORE HE

02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:04.996
FOR FINDINGS. BY THE TO THIS

02:25:05.063 --> 02:25:06.798
PROGRAM. AS I CAN GET BACK TO.

02:25:06.864 --> 02:25:08.733
ALLEN I ALSO. THAT THAT WE'VE

TERMS OR IN ACCESS TO THE

02:25:12.303 --> 02:25:13.571
FUNDING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

02:25:13.638 --> 02:25:14.872
AND YET WE DON'T HAVE TRAILER

02:25:14.939 --> 02:25:16.207
BILL LANGUAGE AND YOU'RE NOT

02:25:18.342 --> 02:25:19.577
US TODAY ABOUT. HOW THE

02:25:19.644 --> 02:25:20.578
REGION'S WILL BE DEFINED WHO

02:25:20.645 --> 02:25:21.913
THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS

02:25:21.979 --> 02:25:23.481
WILL BE. AND YET WE ALREADY

02:25:23.548 --> 02:25:24.449
HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE WITH

02:25:24.515 --> 02:25:26.818
KEEPING HOUSE. WHERE IT CAN HIT

02:25:26.884 --> 02:25:28.419
THE GROUND IT SEEMS TO ME A

02:25:28.486 --> 02:25:30.521
LITTLE FASTER THAN. LIKELY WILL

02:25:30.588 --> 02:25:33.357
WITH A YET TO BE DEFINED.

02:25:33.424 --> 02:25:35.226
INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND

02:25:35.293 --> 02:25:37.128
DILATATION. RITTER ALLEN READ

02:25:37.195 --> 02:25:37.728
THE GOING TO SUCH A POINT YOU

02:25:37.795 --> 02:25:40.231
pBEEN SPENDING ALL THIS MONEY.

02:25:40.298 --> 02:25:40.998
AND THERE'S STILL A LOT OF

02:25:41.065 --> 02:25:42.867
CHALLENGES- I'VE BEEN. ASKING

02:25:42.934 --> 02:25:48.039
US TO SPEND UP. ANOTHER HUGE

02:25:48.106 --> 02:25:48.606
CHUNK OF MONEY WITHOUT. YOU

STRATEGIES AND I THAT'S THAT'S

02:25:50.708 --> 02:25:52.844
THE OLD. FEAR IN AND I THINK

02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:54.312
IT'S I THINK WE KNOW THIS IS

02:25:54.378 --> 02:25:55.413
SUCH AN ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT

02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:57.582
ISSUE. THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY

02:25:57.648 --> 02:25:58.850
YOU'RE ASKING FOR US TO INVEST

02:25:58.916 --> 02:26:00.118
I THINK. THERE'S A LOT OF

02:26:00.184 --> 02:26:01.352
WILLINGNESS TO INVEST THIS KIND

02:26:01.419 --> 02:26:02.353
OF MONEY BECAUSE OF THE

02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:03.588
SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM. AND

02:26:03.654 --> 02:26:05.423
YET I THINK THE LEGISLATURE.

02:26:05.490 --> 02:26:06.891
YOU KNOW IN THE ALLEY-

02:26:06.958 --> 02:26:08.226

02:26:08.292 --> 02:26:10.294
EFFECTIVELY. REALLY NEEDS TO

FEEL COMFORTABLE THA THERE'S A

02:26:11.462 --> 02:26:12.530
CLEAR STRATEGY HERE AND THAT

02:26:12.597 --> 02:26:15.600
THERE'S A CLEAR STRUCTURE AND-

02:26:15.666 --> 02:26:16.367
THAT I THINK IS THAT. THE

02:26:16.434 --> 02:26:17.902
CENTRAL CONCERN THAT I KNOW A

02:26:17.969 --> 02:26:20.438
LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE. SO

02:26:20.505 --> 02:26:21.839
AND I SEE YOU PRESSING YOUR- IT

02:26:21.906 --> 02:26:23.608
JUST MADE ME MAKE ONE POINT IS

02:26:23.674 --> 02:26:25.243
TO POINT OUT THAT THE FINDING

02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:25.943
THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WITH

02:26:26.010 --> 02:26:27.345
CAL AIM THE ENHANCE CARE

02:26:27.411 --> 02:26:28.613
MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES

02:26:28.679 --> 02:26:30.481
THAT HOUSING BATTLE. THAT IS AN

02:26:30.548 --> 02:26:31.415
ON GOING THE WOULD BE A NEW

02:26:31.482 --> 02:26:33.217
MEDI CAL BENEFITS SO THAT THOSE

02:26:33.284 --> 02:26:35.553
TWO PIECES ARE ON GOING-

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:37.989
PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS SOME OF

02:26:38.055 --> 02:26:39.657
THIS. THIS TOPIC. I WOULD ALSO

02:26:39.724 --> 02:26:41.092

THE PLANE WHILE YOU'RE FLYING

02:26:52.069 --> 02:26:54.405

02:26:54.472 --> 02:26:55.506
MILLION DOLLARS COMMITTED

WHAT'S NOW OVER TWO HUNDRED

02:26:56.908 --> 02:26:58.509
MILLION. OUR ANNUAL- FLEXIBLE

02:26:58.576 --> 02:26:59.410
BUDGET MATCHES BRING CORNERS

THAT. IT TO THE EXTENT THAT.

02:27:35.513 --> 02:27:36.480
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

02:27:36.547 --> 02:27:38.216
REFLECTS ON OF THE BEST

02:27:38.282 --> 02:27:38.950
PRACTICES. IN THE EXPORT. IT IS

02:27:39.016 --> 02:27:40.851
NOT STARTING SOMETHING NEW TO

02:27:40.918 --> 02:27:42.620
CLICK IT IF. BUT RATHER

02:27:42.687 --> 02:27:44.589
PROVIDING A SET OF FINANCIAL

RESOURCES AND PROVEN STRATEGIES

02:27:47.992 --> 02:27:49.794
THAT WILL ENHANCE THE CAPACITY.

02:27:49.860 --> 02:27:51.495
OF EXISTING LOCALITIES

02:27:51.562 --> 02:27:52.797
CONTINUUM'S OF CARE AND

02:27:52.863 --> 02:27:54.732
COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM. TO

MORE FOR ME ABOUT WHAT EXISTING

02:28:01.672 --> 02:28:02.807
DATA OR KEY PERFORMANCE

02:28:02.873 --> 02:28:03.908
INDICATORS THAT YOU'RE GONNA

02:28:03.975 --> 02:28:05.376
USED TO CREATE THE REGIONAL

02:28:05.443 --> 02:28:07.778
PROGRAM AND- HE USED TO

02:28:07.845 --> 02:28:09.447
DETERMINE THE ALLOCATION OF

02:28:09.513 --> 02:28:10.848
RESOURCES WITHIN THE REGIONS

02:28:10.915 --> 02:28:11.816
ARE. GOING TO BE A COUPLE

02:28:11.882 --> 02:28:13.851
GUIDING DATA POINTS THAT ARE

02:28:13.918 --> 02:28:15.486
GOING TO BE AT THE HEART OF

02:28:15.553 --> 02:28:18.456
THIS. ALLOCATION TO DECISIONS

02:28:18.522 --> 02:28:20.858
YES THE- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

02:28:20.925 --> 02:28:22.526
THAT'S CURRENTLY POSTED ONLINE

02:28:22.593 --> 02:28:24.629
AND FINANCES WEBSITE SPEAKS TO

02:28:24.695 --> 02:28:25.930
THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY THAT

02:28:25.997 --> 02:28:27.932
WILL BE USING SO IT IS. LOOKING

02:28:27.999 --> 02:28:30.868
AT POINT IN TIME COUNT- IN THE

02:28:30.935 --> 02:28:34.138
END AND THAT. ADDITIONAL NEED

02:28:34.205 --> 02:28:36.407
FOR HOUSING FOR PERSONS WHO ARE

02:28:36.474 --> 02:28:38.142
EXISTING HOMELESS POPULATION IT

02:28:38.209 --> 02:28:39.176
ALSO HAS THE NUMBER OF LOW

INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE

02:28:40.811 --> 02:28:41.312
BURDENED BY THEIR RENT OR

THAT FOURTH COMPONENT THAT I

02:28:50.788 --> 02:28:51.789
MENTIONED EARLIER IS RACIAL

02:28:51.856 --> 02:28:53.424
EQUITY SO. THOSE WOULD BE THE

02:28:53.491 --> 02:28:55.059
FACTORS THAT WOULD BE USED TO

02:28:55.126 --> 02:28:56.060
DEVELOP THE METHODOLOGY THE

02:28:56.127 --> 02:28:57.995
CONVERSATION ON. KIND OF THE

02:28:58.062 --> 02:28:59.463
WEIGHTS THAT WOULD BE USES ON

02:28:59.530 --> 02:29:01.766
GOING AT. NOW IN TERMS OF IN

02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:03.234
TERMS OF HOW IT LOOKS ACROSS

02:29:03.301 --> 02:29:03.868
THE REGION AND WHAT THAT WOULD

02:29:03.934 --> 02:29:05.636

WEEK OR TWO AGO AND THAT'S THIS

02:29:17.848 --> 02:29:19.717
WHOLE ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT

THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT

02:29:21.252 --> 02:29:22.787

THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:44.442
JUST HANGING AROUND THE EDGES

02:29:44.508 --> 02:29:44.975
IS ONE THING THAT WE KEEP

02:29:45.042 --> 02:29:48.979
HEARING. LOCAL FOLK. AND THESE

02:29:49.046 --> 02:29:51.982
ARE PEOPLE WHO IT'S ALMOST LIKE

02:29:52.049 --> 02:29:53.284
THE- YEAH. IT THESE ARE FOLKS

02:29:53.351 --> 02:29:53.918

INVESTMENT CAN GO A LONG WAY IN

02:29:55.820 --> 02:29:56.954
TERMS OF DETERMINING WHETHER

THEY END UP OF WE KNOW. MORE

02:29:58.989 --> 02:30:01.292
MORE. A MORE SERIOUS CASE. AND

02:30:01.359 --> 02:30:02.727
I GUESS A ONE OF THE CONCERNS I

02:30:02.793 --> 02:30:04.228
HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THAT A LOT OF

02:30:04.295 --> 02:30:06.731
THE- EXISTING BUREAUCRACY NAME

02:30:06.797 --> 02:30:11.168

WE MADE DOUBLE DOWN ON A SYSTEM

02:30:17.007 --> 02:30:19.176
WHERE- WITH THERE'S VERY. FEW

02:30:19.243 --> 02:30:20.644
DEDICATED SOURCES FOR FUNDING

02:30:20.711 --> 02:30:22.580

BE EASIER TO HELP BETTER I AT

02:30:25.916 --> 02:30:26.550
HIGH RISK OF ANY UP ON THE

ASIDE SOME MONEY TO HELP THOSE

02:30:32.890 --> 02:30:33.858
FOLKS WHO WERE LIVING IN CARS

02:30:33.924 --> 02:30:34.892
PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL HAVING.

PARKING LOT MY DISTRICT FOR THE

LAST SIX MONTHS. BECAUSE

02:30:42.666 --> 02:30:44.435
THERE'S NO RESOURCE TO GUIDE

02:30:44.502 --> 02:30:45.035
THEM OUT AND THEY'RE JUST. YOU

02:30:45.102 --> 02:30:49.807

WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO HELP

02:30:59.250 --> 02:31:01.352
THOSE FOLKS. SO I WOULD SAY

02:31:01.419 --> 02:31:03.921
THAT THE HOT FUNDING- I

02:31:03.988 --> 02:31:05.222
MENTIONED BEFORE CAN BE USED ON

02:31:05.289 --> 02:31:06.424
PREVENTION AND SHELTER

02:31:06.490 --> 02:31:08.192
DIVERSION AND SO THAT WOULD

02:31:08.259 --> 02:31:09.727
ADDRESS A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS

02:31:09.794 --> 02:31:11.162
YOU JUST MENTIONED. WHAT WE'RE

02:31:11.228 --> 02:31:12.196
WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES RIGHT

02:31:12.263 --> 02:31:13.864
NOW ON AND THINKING ABOUT AND

02:31:13.931 --> 02:31:15.132
AS WERE REVIEWING THE

02:31:15.199 --> 02:31:16.467
APPLICATIONS WE'VE ASKED THEM

02:31:16.534 --> 02:31:18.335
TO SORT OF TAKE A LOOK AT. WHAT

02:31:18.402 --> 02:31:20.671
HOW THEY'RE USING THEIR FUNDING

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:22.039
AND WHAT OTHER RESOURCES THEY

02:31:22.106 --> 02:31:23.841
HAVE AN AND REALLY TRYING TO

02:31:23.908 --> 02:31:25.976
ENSURE. THAT YOU KNOW WE WERE

02:31:26.043 --> 02:31:27.545
AT A HEARING IN SAN FRANCISCO.

02:31:27.611 --> 02:31:28.946
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND I THINK

02:31:29.013 --> 02:31:30.214
MAYOR SHAFT BUT REALLY WELL

02:31:30.281 --> 02:31:31.982
SORT OF A AN INTERVENTION BY I

02:31:32.049 --> 02:31:33.317
APPROPRIATE RATIO OF

02:31:33.384 --> 02:31:35.052
INTERVENTIONS ACROSS THE

02:31:35.119 --> 02:31:36.153
SYSTEM. SO THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST

02:31:36.220 --> 02:31:37.588
BUILDING SHALL NOT JUST BERMAN

02:31:37.655 --> 02:31:38.923
BUILDING PERMITS A PART OF

02:31:38.989 --> 02:31:41.025
HOUSING WHICH TO HAVE ENTIRE IN

02:31:41.091 --> 02:31:42.726
YOUR CHIN SYSTEM THAT CONTRAST

02:31:42.793 --> 02:31:46.964
FOR YOUR- ON THE- OF. AT THAT

02:31:47.031 --> 02:31:48.232
RATE OR ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO

02:31:48.299 --> 02:31:49.867
A COMMON. AND SO. THE FLEX. AND

02:31:49.934 --> 02:31:51.068
OF HOW. REALLY ALLOWS YOU TO

02:31:51.135 --> 02:31:51.635
BUILD OUT THAT ANTI SET OF

02:31:51.702 --> 02:31:52.970
INNER. LOOKING AT WHAT YOU'RE

02:31:53.037 --> 02:31:54.205
YOU'RE COMMUNITIES ALREADY

02:31:54.271 --> 02:31:55.639
INVESTING IN A WHAT GAP YOU

02:31:55.706 --> 02:31:57.908
NEED TO FILL TO HAVE THAT FULL

02:31:57.975 --> 02:32:02.079
RANGE OF INTERVENTIONS. YES AND

02:32:02.146 --> 02:32:03.080
JUST TO ADD TO THAT THE ONE

02:32:03.147 --> 02:32:04.381
THING THE STATE HAS PROVIDED IN

02:32:04.448 --> 02:32:05.549
THEIR PROGRAMS IS A LOT OF

02:32:05.616 --> 02:32:07.918
FLEXIBILITY AND IT IS CRUCIAL

02:32:07.985 --> 02:32:11.555
FROM PREVENTION TO HOUSING AND

02:32:11.622 --> 02:32:12.990
DIVERSION KEEPING PEOPLE AND

02:32:13.057 --> 02:32:15.526
HOUSING BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS WE

02:32:15.593 --> 02:32:17.261
ALL KNOW IT'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY

02:32:17.328 --> 02:32:18.395
SO WHEN YOU COME TO THE LOCAL

02:32:18.462 --> 02:32:20.231
COMMUNITY TO SAY YOU COULD USE

02:32:20.297 --> 02:32:21.665
THIS FOR DIVERSION YOU COULD

02:32:21.732 --> 02:32:24.969
USE THIS FOR PREVENTION OR DO

02:32:25.035 --> 02:32:26.136
YOU USE THAT FOR THE MOST

02:32:26.203 --> 02:32:28.405
VULNERABLE AND SO YOU'RE MAKING

02:32:28.472 --> 02:32:30.307
TOUGH CHOICES ACROSS THE BOARD

02:32:30.374 --> 02:32:32.610
SO ES HAPPENED IN CAN PROVIDE

02:32:32.676 --> 02:32:34.278
THAT. WILL IT BE USED IN THAT

02:32:34.345 --> 02:32:35.579
WAY BASED UPON THE LOCAL

02:32:35.646 --> 02:32:39.517
PRIORITIES IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE.

02:32:39.583 --> 02:32:42.887
CAN I ASK OUR YOU KNOW HI

02:32:42.953 --> 02:32:43.387
EIGHTY EIGHT FROM YOUR

02:32:43.454 --> 02:32:44.655
PERSPECTIVE IN LA COURSES COME

02:32:44.722 --> 02:32:46.390
IN FOR WITH A DIFFERENT TYPE OF

02:32:46.457 --> 02:32:50.594
FUNDING PROPOSAL HOW DO YOU SEE.

02:32:50.661 --> 02:32:52.696
WE ARE WE ARE DO YOU SEE THESE

02:32:52.763 --> 02:32:54.498
PROPOSALS BEING FUNDAMENTALLY

02:32:54.565 --> 02:32:56.600
CONFLICT JEWEL OR OR HARM IT DO

02:32:56.667 --> 02:32:58.302
YOU SEE A WAY FOR US TO MARRY

02:32:58.369 --> 02:32:59.436
THE NEEDS AND ISSUES THAT YOU

02:32:59.503 --> 02:33:01.805
HAVE ON THE GROUND IN LA WITH.

02:33:01.872 --> 02:33:02.439
THAT WHICH IS BEING PROPOSED BY

02:33:02.506 --> 02:33:04.875
THE GOVERNOR. I THINK THERE'S A

02:33:04.942 --> 02:33:06.176
THERE IS A WAY TO THREAD THE

02:33:06.243 --> 02:33:07.511
NEEDLE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A

02:33:07.578 --> 02:33:08.979
LOT IN LA IS THIS CHALLENGE

02:33:09.046 --> 02:33:10.481
AROUND IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE

02:33:10.548 --> 02:33:12.383
OF HOW DO YOU. BUILD A SYSTEM

02:33:12.449 --> 02:33:13.617
IT'S REALLY EFFICIENT MAKE

02:33:13.684 --> 02:33:15.653
TWEAKS AS NEEDED- BUT ALSO

02:33:15.719 --> 02:33:17.121
DON'T TAKE A STEP BACKWARD IT

02:33:17.187 --> 02:33:18.155
UNINTENTIONALLY FRAGMENTING

02:33:18.222 --> 02:33:19.490
THINGS AND BREAKING THE CURRENT

02:33:19.557 --> 02:33:21.292
SYSTEM A PART IN AN EFFORT TO

02:33:21.358 --> 02:33:22.660
MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER- AND

02:33:22.726 --> 02:33:24.194
THAT'S A HARD BALANCE FOR US

02:33:24.261 --> 02:33:25.462
SO. I THINK FOR US WHAT IT

02:33:25.529 --> 02:33:27.264
REALLY COMES DOWN TO DO AROUND

02:33:27.331 --> 02:33:28.933
ACCOUNTABILITY IS MAKING SURE

02:33:28.999 --> 02:33:30.467
THAT WHAT WE'RE MEASURING IS.

02:33:30.534 --> 02:33:31.802
HEALTH OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM

02:33:31.869 --> 02:33:33.737
AND NOT JUST DIFFERENT PIECES

02:33:33.804 --> 02:33:35.706
OF THE SYSTEM SO WHAT I MEAN

02:33:35.773 --> 02:33:37.341
IS. HOW THE HOW DO WE LOOK AT

02:33:37.408 --> 02:33:38.876
HOW THIS. IS FUNCTIONING WITH

02:33:38.943 --> 02:33:40.010
ALL OF ITS COMPONENTS AND HOW

02:33:40.077 --> 02:33:41.545
THOSE ARE INTERACTING AND USE

02:33:41.612 --> 02:33:42.980
THAT TO JUDGE THE EFFICACY OR

02:33:43.047 --> 02:33:44.615
THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SYSTEM.

02:33:44.682 --> 02:33:45.816
NOT JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE

02:33:45.883 --> 02:33:47.217
GOING PLATE AND IT ARM HOUSING

02:33:47.284 --> 02:33:48.886
OR A DECREASE IN THE ON

02:33:48.953 --> 02:33:50.421
SHELTERED BY WHAT'S THE ACTUAL

02:33:50.487 --> 02:33:52.022
OUT COMMON IN ARE WE- ARE WE

02:33:52.089 --> 02:33:53.824
TAKING A BALANCED APPROACH IN

02:33:53.891 --> 02:33:55.059
OUR INTERVENTIONS AND SO. PART

02:33:55.125 --> 02:33:56.493
OF THE CONCERN FROM THE OUTLAYS

02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:58.562
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH

02:33:58.629 --> 02:34:00.130
WORK DONE TO BUILD UP A SYSTEM

02:34:00.197 --> 02:34:02.266
THAT. IT BALLOT NUMBER. BRING

02:34:02.333 --> 02:34:04.935
ON ANOTHER LAYER BERMAN. PUT

02:34:05.002 --> 02:34:05.502
THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THE CITY

02:34:05.569 --> 02:34:09.139
COUNTY CO MODEL. FURTHER SOME

02:34:09.206 --> 02:34:12.343
THAT WERE REALLY WORKING. TO

02:34:12.409 --> 02:34:15.646
BRING TOGETHER SPECIAL GIVEN

02:34:15.713 --> 02:34:20.084
THE LOCAL RESOURCES WE HAVE

02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:23.120
COME AND A LOT. HOW DO YOU DO

02:34:23.187 --> 02:34:33.797
THERE ARE. I GO OUT. IF

02:34:33.864 --> 02:34:35.799
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LA COUNTY-

02:34:35.866 --> 02:34:37.334
ELLIE CITY IN THE C. O. C. BUT

02:34:37.401 --> 02:34:38.335
I KNOW THAT NOT EVERY

02:34:38.402 --> 02:34:39.570
JURISDICTION IS LIKE THAT SO I

02:34:39.637 --> 02:34:40.771
THINK. ALLOWING THE

02:34:40.838 --> 02:34:41.705
JURISDICTIONS TO HAVE THE

02:34:41.772 --> 02:34:43.107
FLEXIBILITY THAT WE NEED TO

02:34:43.173 --> 02:34:44.508
DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE

02:34:44.575 --> 02:34:46.243
BEST WAY FOR THE MONEY TO COME

02:34:46.310 --> 02:34:47.878
IN I THINK THAT THE- THE LOCAL

02:34:47.945 --> 02:34:50.080
OFFICIALS ARE. ADDICTS ARE ABLE

02:34:50.147 --> 02:34:50.648
TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR

02:34:50.714 --> 02:34:52.282
THEIR OWN. THEIR OWN

02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:54.351
JURISDICTIONS. OKAY I

02:34:54.418 --> 02:34:55.486
APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S ANSWERS

02:34:55.552 --> 02:34:57.087
AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE-

02:34:57.154 --> 02:34:58.422
THE FOR PARENTS OF THAT OF THE

02:34:58.489 --> 02:35:00.257
CHAIRMAN. YEAH THIS IS I DON'T

02:35:00.324 --> 02:35:00.858
HAVE TO EXPLAIN ANYONE HERE

02:35:00.924 --> 02:35:02.993
ABOUT ABOUT. YOU KNOW NORM IS A

02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:04.495
PROBLEM THAT THIS IS ON OUR ON

02:35:04.561 --> 02:35:05.596
OUR STREETS AND IN OUR

02:35:05.663 --> 02:35:08.465
COMMUNITIES AND- YOU KNOW I'M-

02:35:08.532 --> 02:35:10.934
I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE-

02:35:11.001 --> 02:35:12.703
EXTRAORDINARY ATTENTION THAT

02:35:12.770 --> 02:35:13.270
THE GOVERNOR AND THE

02:35:13.337 --> 02:35:14.872
MINISTRATION GIVING TO THIS

02:35:14.938 --> 02:35:15.606
ISSUE I THINK IT'S IMMENSELY

02:35:15.673 --> 02:35:18.042
IMPORTANT- I ALSO WANT TO MAKE

02:35:18.108 --> 02:35:19.977
SURE THAT WE- CAN AFFORD INVEST

02:35:20.044 --> 02:35:21.311
THIS KIND OF MONEY WHICH I

02:35:21.378 --> 02:35:22.713
THINK. WE WERE INTO A RIGHT

02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:23.614
GONNA CHRIS STRUCK SECTION IN

HAVE SOME OTHER MATERIALS AS

02:40:13.437 --> 02:40:14.271
WELL I THINK IT'S AN INCREDIBLE

02:40:14.338 --> 02:40:16.373

ONE FIFTY OLD BY.

02:40:41.965 --> 02:40:43.734
INTERPRETATION SO I THOUGHT

02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:48.271
THAT WAS. BRAVE AND COURAGEOUS

02:40:48.338 --> 02:40:50.841
WHAT WAS HE SAYING BETWEEN THE

02:40:50.907 --> 02:40:56.279

I WILL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:41:02.486 --> 02:41:03.453
JUST TO SAY THAT THERE'S SOME

02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:05.088
EMERGING CONVERSATIONS AROUND

02:41:05.155 --> 02:41:06.890
THE NEED FOR SOME HIGH ACUITY

02:41:06.957 --> 02:41:09.593
PROBABLY SMALL SITE MODELS- AND

02:41:09.659 --> 02:41:10.927
BRING CORNERS IS EAGER TO BE

02:41:10.994 --> 02:41:11.695
PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS

02:41:11.762 --> 02:41:12.662
BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE

02:41:12.729 --> 02:41:15.298
CREATING TOM HIGHLY- SERVICE

02:41:15.365 --> 02:41:17.401

FUND WHERE WE HAVE A PROPOSAL

02:41:37.054 --> 02:41:38.688
AND NOW SEE THERE'S A LOT OF

02:41:38.755 --> 02:41:39.289
FEEDBACK IN THE CONVERSATION

02:41:39.356 --> 02:41:40.357

02:42:13.290 --> 02:42:15.025
TRANSITION FROM THE

02:42:15.092 --> 02:42:16.493
INSTITUTIONS TO THE STREETS TO

02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:17.861
THE JAILS AND SAW THE LARGEST

02:42:17.928 --> 02:42:19.896
MENTAL INSTITUTION AN ORANGE

IN DOWNTOWN SANTANA SO I'M I'M

02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:25.135
GLAD THAT WE'RE DOING SOMETHING

02:42:25.202 --> 02:42:28.472
BUT I'VE GONE DOWN THIS ROAD

02:42:28.538 --> 02:42:29.773
NOW BEEN BEAT UP IN COMMITTEE.

02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:33.677
SO I'M JUST KERN THIS. WHAT

02:42:33.743 --> 02:42:35.779

02:42:35.846 --> 02:42:38.548
HELP THIS LEGISLATURE CHANGE

02:42:38.615 --> 02:42:41.418
ITS PERSPECTIVE ON LPS SO SICK

02:42:41.485 --> 02:42:42.519
TO THINGS AND SO MY COLLEAGUES

02:42:42.586 --> 02:42:44.054
MAY WANT TO ELABORATE THE FIRST

02:42:44.121 --> 02:42:45.989
THING IS I THINK MY ONE THING

02:42:46.056 --> 02:42:46.590
I'D SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS

02:42:46.656 --> 02:42:48.391
NOT SAYING IS YOU KNOW WE

02:42:48.458 --> 02:42:49.559
SHOULDN'T ROLL THE CLOCK BACK

02:42:49.626 --> 02:42:51.828
TO EXACTLY WHERE I WAS BEFORE

02:42:51.895 --> 02:42:52.796
YOU KNOW HE WAS TALKING ABOUT

02:42:52.863 --> 02:42:54.931
WHAT WE DID IS WE EMPTIED THOSE

02:42:54.998 --> 02:42:56.533
INSTITUTIONS WITH THE PROMISE

02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:58.001
THAT THERE WOULD BE COMMUNITY

02:42:58.068 --> 02:42:59.803
SERVICES ON THE OTHER AND THEN

02:42:59.870 --> 02:43:00.904
FOR A NUMBER OF COMPLICATED.

02:43:00.971 --> 02:43:01.771
REASONS DOES EVER REALLY

02:43:01.838 --> 02:43:03.006
PROVIDED AT A LEVEL THAT WAS

02:43:03.073 --> 02:43:05.775
NEAT- BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT

02:43:05.842 --> 02:43:07.444
THE STATUS QUO ANTE IS WHAT THE

02:43:07.511 --> 02:43:08.411
ADMINISTRATION OR ANYBODY ELSE

02:43:08.478 --> 02:43:09.746
WANTS TO USE IN A DIAGNOSING

02:43:09.813 --> 02:43:11.681
THE PROBLEM THERE AND THEN I

02:43:11.748 --> 02:43:13.483
THINK AT THE SAME THING AND

02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:14.384
COLLEAGUES CAN ELABORATE ON

02:43:14.451 --> 02:43:16.553
THIS IS A WE TALKED ABOUT

02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:18.221
POPULATION THAT'S EXPERIENCING

02:43:18.288 --> 02:43:19.322
HOMELESSNESS ARE AT RISK OF

02:43:19.389 --> 02:43:20.590
THAT THAT ALL HAS THESE COUPLE

02:43:20.657 --> 02:43:23.260
CORING DISORDER. EIGHT PEOPLE

02:43:23.326 --> 02:43:25.195
IN A MIX OF SETTINGS SOME HAVE

02:43:25.262 --> 02:43:26.863
FAMILY WANT TO COMPEL SOME

02:43:26.930 --> 02:43:31.368
DON'T HAVE ANY FAMILY AT ALL-

02:43:31.434 --> 02:43:38.708
SOME EXPERT IT'S BOUNCE. SEVERE

02:43:38.775 --> 02:43:41.878
MENTAL. NUMBER THAT FOR OKAY.

02:43:41.945 --> 02:43:42.913
HEY THAT WAS THAT HE AND

02:43:42.979 --> 02:43:43.613
MINISTRY ARE NOT SATISFY WITH

02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:44.781
WHERE WE ARE NOW BOTH IN TERMS

02:43:44.848 --> 02:43:46.249
OF THE THAT CAN SERVICE WAS

02:43:46.316 --> 02:43:47.918
WERE NEVER PROVIDED THAT LEVEL

02:43:47.984 --> 02:43:49.186
AND THE FACT THAT SOME THESE

02:43:49.252 --> 02:43:50.654
LAWS WHILE MAYBE WELL

02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:52.622
INTENTIONED I PERHAPS BECOME

02:43:52.689 --> 02:43:54.524
TOO RESTRICTIVE IN TERMS OF THE

02:43:54.591 --> 02:43:55.358
TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY THAT WE

02:43:55.425 --> 02:43:57.260
NEED TO ATTACK THIS ISSUE. YOU

02:43:57.327 --> 02:43:58.428
BECAUSE WE WOULD NEVER LET

02:43:58.495 --> 02:43:59.829
SOMEONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S JUST

02:43:59.896 --> 02:44:01.898
ROAM THE STREETS RIGHT AND- AND

02:44:01.965 --> 02:44:03.300
SO WE'RE DEALING WAS SEVERELY

02:44:03.366 --> 02:44:05.035
MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE THAT JUST.

02:44:05.101 --> 02:44:06.836
NEED THE RIGHT MEDICATION WHAT

02:44:06.903 --> 02:44:08.705
THE RIGHT DOSAGE TO. START

02:44:08.772 --> 02:44:10.540
MAYBE MAINSTREAMING AND DEALING

02:44:10.607 --> 02:44:11.641
WITH THEIR SCHIZOPHRENIA AND

02:44:11.708 --> 02:44:13.109
THE REST. AND JUST TO KIND OF

02:44:13.176 --> 02:44:15.011
JUST LET HIM STAY OUT THERE DAY

02:44:15.078 --> 02:44:17.581
AFTER DAY AFTER DAY- SO THAT'S

02:44:17.647 --> 02:44:18.882
WHY I WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE

02:44:18.949 --> 02:44:19.649
STATE OF THE STATE AND I'M

02:44:19.716 --> 02:44:21.518
LOOKING FORWARD. TO THE

02:44:21.585 --> 02:44:24.154
LEGISLATIVE APPROACH. AT IN

02:44:24.221 --> 02:44:25.822
ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP LET

02:44:25.889 --> 02:44:27.324
ME KNOW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

02:44:27.390 --> 02:44:31.828
THANK. ALL THE WORKERS ZERO.

02:44:31.895 --> 02:44:35.532
WELL IF I MAY IN MY BRIEF THE

02:44:35.599 --> 02:44:36.633
DEPARTURE FROM THE LITTLE

02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:37.834
HOOVER COMMISSION AND BRING IT

02:44:37.901 --> 02:44:39.536
BACK TO MORE COMPLICATION FOR

02:44:39.603 --> 02:44:42.706
YOU. BUT I WAS ASKED WHY DON'T

02:44:42.772 --> 02:44:45.976
WE FOCUS ON. TREATMENT FOR

02:44:46.042 --> 02:44:50.747
BATTERERS AS A PART OF THIS. IT

02:44:50.814 --> 02:44:52.749
THE INDIVIDUALS TO BECOME

02:44:52.816 --> 02:44:54.818
ABUSIVE DOMESTIC PARTNER WELL

02:44:54.884 --> 02:44:57.520
ANYWAY BUT I THINK YOU SEE IT

02:44:57.587 --> 02:44:59.222
THE MARK REMARKS I MADE BEFORE

02:44:59.289 --> 02:45:01.524
I LEAVE- THAT I THINK ON THE

02:45:01.591 --> 02:45:03.093
COMMITTEE THERE'S A LOT OF

02:45:03.159 --> 02:45:05.028
CONCERN ABOUT. THERE'S

02:45:05.095 --> 02:45:06.663
ENTHUSIASM ABOUT ASPECTS OF THE

02:45:06.730 --> 02:45:08.498
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT THERE'S

02:45:08.565 --> 02:45:09.866
REALLY SOME CONCERNS ABOUT IT.

02:45:09.933 --> 02:45:12.302
THAT IT MAY NOT BE QUITE COOKED

02:45:12.369 --> 02:45:14.638
YET ONE ELEMENT OF THIS IS THE

02:45:14.704 --> 02:45:16.873
VERSION AND I HAVE TO GIVE AN

02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:19.843
EXAMPLE OF- THAT ACTIONS THAT

02:45:19.909 --> 02:45:23.280
HAVE. RUINED ALL APART. OF THE

02:45:23.346 --> 02:45:25.248
SUCCESS OF DIVERSION AND THAT

02:45:25.315 --> 02:45:27.484
IS THE DRUG COURT GO BACK TO

02:45:27.550 --> 02:45:29.185
THE EIGHTIES AND I WORKED WITH

02:45:29.252 --> 02:45:30.687
THESE DRUG COURTS IN THE

02:45:30.754 --> 02:45:32.255
COUNTIES ARE REPRESENTED

02:45:32.322 --> 02:45:33.990
THEY'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

02:45:34.057 --> 02:45:35.258
BECAUSE THEY WERE BUILT ON A

02:45:35.325 --> 02:45:37.827
MODEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:45:37.894 --> 02:45:40.196
TREATMENT A BABY AND THERE'S

02:45:40.263 --> 02:45:42.465
CONSEQUENCES IF YOU DON'T. WELL

02:45:42.532 --> 02:45:45.669
PROP FORTY SEVEN WIPE THAT OUT.

02:45:45.735 --> 02:45:49.472
AND NOW THE OF THOSE WHO ARE OF

02:45:49.539 --> 02:45:53.777
NEED OF TREATMENT. THEY OPT FOR

02:45:53.843 --> 02:45:57.147
THE EASY FLASH INCARCERATION

02:45:57.213 --> 02:45:59.215
WHICH FRANKLY FOLKS IS A JOKE.

02:45:59.282 --> 02:46:00.317
IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T HELP

02:46:00.383 --> 02:46:01.918
ANYBODY WITH THEIR ADDICTION SO

02:46:01.985 --> 02:46:03.520
THEY JUST SIT IN THE IN THE

02:46:03.586 --> 02:46:05.088
JAIL FOR FIVE DAYS AND THEY'RE

02:46:05.155 --> 02:46:06.189
RIGHT BACK ON THE STREETS AND

02:46:06.256 --> 02:46:07.724
RIHT INTO THEIR HAPPEN AGAIN

02:46:07.791 --> 02:46:09.959
SO THAT TOTALLY UNDERMINED THE

02:46:10.026 --> 02:46:11.594
MERIT OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD

02:46:11.661 --> 02:46:13.830
WORK FOR DECADES. THAT'S WHY

02:46:13.897 --> 02:46:15.665
IT'S A PREMIUM FOR US TO REALLY

02:46:15.732 --> 02:46:19.102
CAREFULLY EXAMINE. HOW THIS ALL

02:46:19.169 --> 02:46:21.171
FITS TOGETHER. AND THE REGIONAL

02:46:21.237 --> 02:46:24.207
STRUCTURE MAKES LOGICAL SENSE

02:46:24.274 --> 02:46:25.575
BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION IS

02:46:25.642 --> 02:46:27.711
EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED I

02:46:27.777 --> 02:46:29.412
THINK THE POINT THAT I MAKE AND

02:46:29.479 --> 02:46:31.781
WOOD WELL ON HERE. IT'S GOING

02:46:31.848 --> 02:46:33.483
TO NEED A LOT OF WORK THIS

02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:37.354
COMPLICATED IDEA. IT AND THEN

02:46:37.420 --> 02:46:39.022
SOME OF THE APPLICATION I THINK

02:46:39.089 --> 02:46:40.156
OF OBVIOUSLY WE'RE WILLING TO

02:46:40.223 --> 02:46:41.558
WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

02:46:41.624 --> 02:46:44.394
AND GET A LOT OF THE GOVERNOR

02:46:44.461 --> 02:46:47.030
FOR TAKEN A LOOK AT THAT NEED.

02:46:47.097 --> 02:46:48.498
IT JUST JUST PROVIDING HOUSING.

02:46:48.565 --> 02:46:50.934
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE HAVE

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:52.035
TO LOOK AT THAT OTHER ASPECT

02:46:52.102 --> 02:46:54.504
THAT I DID THROW IN A HOMELESS

02:46:54.571 --> 02:46:56.639
ADVOCATE WHO SAID JIM WE CAN.

02:46:56.706 --> 02:46:59.776
BUILD SHELTERS FOR PEOPLE BUT-

02:46:59.843 --> 02:47:01.411
THE COST SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:47:01.478 --> 02:47:02.379
MORE BECAUSE OUR STATE

02:47:02.445 --> 02:47:04.180
REQUIREMENTS IMPOSITIONS AND

02:47:04.247 --> 02:47:07.317
REGULATIONS. THAT REALLY

02:47:07.384 --> 02:47:10.153
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR ANYBODY.

02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:12.222
PROVIDING HOUSING FOR HOMELESS

02:47:12.288 --> 02:47:13.523
OR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN BEING

02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:15.225
ABLE A YOUNG COUPLE TO BUY A

02:47:15.291 --> 02:47:18.294
HOME. SO THOSE ARE SOME THINGS

02:47:18.361 --> 02:47:19.529
THAT IN THE MACRO WE NEED TO

02:47:19.596 --> 02:47:21.364
EXAMINE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

02:47:21.431 --> 02:47:25.568
MORE WORK THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU

02:47:25.635 --> 02:47:28.238
CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU

02:47:28.304 --> 02:47:30.240
VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR-

02:47:30.306 --> 02:47:32.041
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION WE'VE

02:47:32.108 --> 02:47:33.810
HAD HERE TODAY I THINK IT'S-

02:47:33.877 --> 02:47:35.145
BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL TO

02:47:35.211 --> 02:47:36.312
UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER

02:47:36.379 --> 02:47:39.048
WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING I'M- ALL

02:47:39.115 --> 02:47:41.684
OVER THE STATE- A COUPLE OF

02:47:41.751 --> 02:47:43.620
COMMENTS AND THEN A COUPLE OF

02:47:43.686 --> 02:47:47.223
QUESTIONS- ONE IS- I'M

02:47:47.290 --> 02:47:49.793
CONCERNED ABOUT THE REGIONAL.

02:47:49.859 --> 02:47:54.564
INFRASTRUCTURE A DISCUSSION-

02:47:54.631 --> 02:47:55.965
ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL AND I

02:47:56.032 --> 02:47:59.068
HEARD PEOPLE SAY THAT- WE HAVE

02:47:59.135 --> 02:48:00.270
SOME AREAS OF THE STATE THAT

02:48:00.336 --> 02:48:01.604
WORK REALLY WELL TOGETHER AND

02:48:01.671 --> 02:48:03.540
OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. THAT

02:48:03.606 --> 02:48:04.874
DON'T FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF

02:48:04.941 --> 02:48:07.410
REASONS AND I REPRESENT A RURAL

02:48:07.477 --> 02:48:10.780
MORE RURAL DISTRICT- THAT HAS

02:48:10.847 --> 02:48:13.616
PARTS OF OR ALL OF IN INTER IN

02:48:13.683 --> 02:48:14.818
TOTAL SIX COUNTY SO I'VE KIND

02:48:14.884 --> 02:48:17.053
OF LOOKED AT- WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:20.156
WITH HE BEEN HAPPY ON IN IN

02:48:20.223 --> 02:48:21.424
THOSE COUNTIES AND SOME ARE.

02:48:21.491 --> 02:48:22.926
DOING A REAL GOOD JOB IN

02:48:22.992 --> 02:48:24.928
OTHERS- ARE REALLY STRUGGLING

02:48:24.994 --> 02:48:26.463
AND SO I GUESS THE FOR THE

02:48:26.529 --> 02:48:28.865
FIRST QUESTION IS- HAVE WE

02:48:28.932 --> 02:48:30.200
LOOKED AT WHERE THE SUCCESSES

02:48:30.266 --> 02:48:33.703
ARE AND WHAT'S COST THEM OR

02:48:33.770 --> 02:48:36.873
WHAT TO MAKE SUCCESS AND WERE

02:48:36.940 --> 02:48:40.677
WE'VE- WHERE IT'S THAT THE-

02:48:40.743 --> 02:48:41.444
RESTRICTIONS OF. STRUGGLED I'M

02:48:41.511 --> 02:48:43.012
I'M A SUPPORTER LOCAL

02:48:43.079 --> 02:48:45.215
GOVERNMENT TO QUITE FRANKLY MY

02:48:45.281 --> 02:48:46.216
DRUTHERS STARTED DOING THIS

02:48:46.282 --> 02:48:48.318
WORK. THIS BUDGET WORK WOULD

02:48:48.384 --> 02:48:50.453
HAVE BEEN TO MAKE GRANTS TO

02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:52.655
CITIES AND COUNTIES AND THEN

02:48:52.722 --> 02:48:53.590
REQUIRED THEM TO WORK WORK

02:48:53.656 --> 02:48:57.227
TOGETHER- BUT- SO THAT'S THE

02:48:57.293 --> 02:48:58.895
FIRST QUESTION IS HAVE WE

02:48:58.962 --> 02:48:59.863
LOOKED AT THAT AND IT DO WE

02:48:59.929 --> 02:49:01.798
HAVE ANY ANALYSIS OF WHERE

02:49:01.865 --> 02:49:03.733
THAT'S- THAT'S WORKED IN WHERE

02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:05.969
IT'S NOT. AND THEN ON. THE

02:49:06.035 --> 02:49:08.438
OTHER QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH-

02:49:08.505 --> 02:49:09.472
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING

02:49:09.539 --> 02:49:13.009
AND HOMELESSNESS TODAY. AND WE

02:49:13.076 --> 02:49:15.612
DON'T HAVE ARE THE STATE'S

02:49:15.678 --> 02:49:17.714
MAJOR HOUSING ENTITY AT THE

02:49:17.780 --> 02:49:20.650
TABLE SO THE QUESTION. IS

02:49:20.717 --> 02:49:21.985
RAISED WHERE'S EACH SEAT IN

02:49:22.051 --> 02:49:23.887
COLLEGE OF A WHICH DO THE

02:49:23.953 --> 02:49:26.689
FINANCING AND- REALLY DOG

02:49:26.756 --> 02:49:27.557
WHETHER COMMUNITIES ARE

02:49:27.624 --> 02:49:29.792
BUILDING HOUSING OR NOT THEY'RE

02:49:29.859 --> 02:49:32.495
NOT THEY'RE NOT AT THE TABLE I

02:49:32.562 --> 02:49:33.096
WONDER IF THERE'S A REASON FOR

02:49:33.162 --> 02:49:37.200
THAT. I CENTER CARRIER ALL

02:49:37.267 --> 02:49:38.434
SPEAK BRIEFLY TO BOTH OF THOSE

02:49:38.501 --> 02:49:39.536
AND THEN COLLEAGUES MAY HAVE

02:49:39.602 --> 02:49:41.204
COMMENTS AS WELL I THINK ON THE

02:49:41.271 --> 02:49:42.505
FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT WHEN

02:49:42.572 --> 02:49:43.973
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT

02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:45.675
ONE SIZE. DOESN'T FIT ALL AND

02:49:45.742 --> 02:49:46.876
SO AND WE'VE BEEN THINKING A

02:49:46.943 --> 02:49:48.912
LOT ABOUT NOT OF COURSE IT'S- A

02:49:48.978 --> 02:49:50.880
BIG STATE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT

02:49:50.947 --> 02:49:52.248
COUNTIES OVER FOUR HUNDRED

02:49:52.315 --> 02:49:54.651
CITIES. AND SO I THINK- WE HAVE

02:49:54.717 --> 02:49:56.152
DONE YET IN THE ANALYSIS

02:49:56.219 --> 02:49:58.021
THERE'S ALWAYS MORE TO DO BUT-

02:49:58.087 --> 02:49:58.788
IN TERMS OF SPEAKING WITH

02:49:58.855 --> 02:49:59.889
ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING SOME OF

02:49:59.956 --> 02:50:01.791
THEM REPRESENTED AT THIS TABLE.

02:50:01.858 --> 02:50:02.825
TO INFORM HOW THE

02:50:02.892 --> 02:50:03.826
ADMINISTRATION IS THINKING

02:50:03.893 --> 02:50:05.395
ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. AT ONE

02:50:05.461 --> 02:50:06.729
POINT THAT I DEFINITELY WANT TO

02:50:06.796 --> 02:50:08.831
EMPHASIZE IS- IT IS CERTAINLY

02:50:08.898 --> 02:50:10.166
THE CASE AND IS GONE A LOT OF

02:50:10.233 --> 02:50:11.834
ATTENTION THAT. NONPROFIT YOU

02:50:11.901 --> 02:50:13.736
KNOW NON CITIES OR COUNTIES.

02:50:13.803 --> 02:50:14.504
CAN APPLY TO BE REGIONAL

02:50:14.571 --> 02:50:16.139
ADMINISTRATORS. BUT IT'S ALSO

02:50:16.205 --> 02:50:16.973
IMPORTANT EMPHASIZE THAT

02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:19.242
COUNTIES AND CITIES CAN ALSO

02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:19.842
APPLY TO BE REGIONAL

02:50:19.909 --> 02:50:21.511
ADMINISTRATOR SO THEY- ANY.

02:50:21.578 --> 02:50:23.413
ENTITY THAT APPLIES IS SUBJECT

02:50:23.479 --> 02:50:24.781
TO A 10% ADMINISTRATIVE CAP

02:50:24.847 --> 02:50:26.616
BUT- CERTAINLY IF A CITY OR

02:50:26.683 --> 02:50:28.484
COUNTY- IS DOING GREAT WORK

02:50:28.551 --> 02:50:29.652
ALREADY. AND THEY'RE

02:50:29.719 --> 02:50:31.588
COLLABORATING WITH THE OTHERS

02:50:31.654 --> 02:50:34.557
LOCAL. STICKS THAT ARE THERE.

02:50:34.624 --> 02:50:36.359
AND THEY APPLY. FOR THE FAA.

02:50:36.426 --> 02:50:38.661
THE RISE. TOP OF THE NOW BASED

02:50:38.728 --> 02:50:41.497
ON THE CALL. IN THEIR- I

02:50:41.564 --> 02:50:42.298
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THEY

02:50:42.365 --> 02:50:43.600
WILL WIN THE REASON ON. WRITER

02:50:43.666 --> 02:50:44.634
APPLICATION AND BE ABLE TO.

02:50:44.701 --> 02:50:45.301
CONTINUE TO COURT WITH THE DAY.

02:50:45.368 --> 02:50:47.804
FINE AND THEN ON THE- QUESTION.

02:50:47.870 --> 02:50:49.005
ANOTHER TABLES ALREADY PRETTY

02:50:49.072 --> 02:50:50.540
CROWDED WITH A LOT OF US

02:50:50.607 --> 02:50:51.808
ALREADY. I WILL SAY TO JUST

02:50:51.874 --> 02:50:54.711
SPEAKING. FOR FINANCE I THINK-

02:50:54.777 --> 02:50:56.412
OFTEN WITH THESE HEARINGS YOU

02:50:56.479 --> 02:50:57.246
KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH GROUND TO

02:50:57.313 --> 02:50:59.749
COVER AND WE- TEND TO FOCUS A

02:50:59.816 --> 02:51:01.217
LOT ON WHAT'S NEW IN THE

02:51:01.284 --> 02:51:02.819
BUDGET. THIS YEAR. THERE WERE

02:51:02.885 --> 02:51:04.320
TWENTY. TWO HOUSING PARTICULAR

02:51:04.387 --> 02:51:05.922
THERE WAS ALMOST TWO BILLION

02:51:05.989 --> 02:51:07.590
DOLLARS IN NEW FUNDING. LAST

02:51:07.657 --> 02:51:10.259
YEAR- IN IN THAT'S IN ADDITION

02:51:10.326 --> 02:51:11.427
TO THE HOMELESSNESS. FUNDING

02:51:11.494 --> 02:51:13.963
THAT WE DISCUSSED. SO I THINK.

02:51:14.030 --> 02:51:14.964
THAT WAS A LOT OF THE HOUSING

02:51:15.031 --> 02:51:16.866
DEPARTMENTS THEY'RE LOOKING OUT

02:51:16.933 --> 02:51:18.735
IMPLEMENTED FUNDING. AND HERE

02:51:18.801 --> 02:51:19.936
OF COURSE ONE OF THE BIG YOU

02:51:20.003 --> 02:51:22.171
PROPOSALS IS THAT ACCESS TO

02:51:22.238 --> 02:51:24.140
HOUSING BONDS. WITH HHS AND DSS

02:51:24.207 --> 02:51:26.309
SPECIFICALLY BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO

02:51:26.376 --> 02:51:27.343
GET BACK TO YOU ON ANY

02:51:27.410 --> 02:51:31.114
QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THE.

02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:31.748
BROAD ARRAY OF PROGRAMS. YEAH I

02:51:31.814 --> 02:51:32.715
THAT THE CHALLENGE THAT FOR ME

02:51:32.782 --> 02:51:33.449
JUST IN TERMS OF HOW WE'VE

02:51:33.516 --> 02:51:34.884
ROLLED OUT MONEY IN THE PAST IS

02:51:34.951 --> 02:51:37.086
ON THE CEO SEES IT PLAYED AT

02:51:37.153 --> 02:51:40.590
THE CENTRAL ROLE- AND- IN SOME

02:51:40.657 --> 02:51:41.691
COMMUNITIES A DONE A REALLY

02:51:41.758 --> 02:51:43.493
GOOD JOB BUT- THEY THE REALITY

02:51:43.559 --> 02:51:44.927
OF THE SITUATION. IS THAT WE

02:51:44.994 --> 02:51:46.262
HAVEN'T REQUIRED A PUBLIC

02:51:46.329 --> 02:51:47.430
ACCOUNTING OF WHERE THE MONEY

02:51:47.497 --> 02:51:49.799
GOES WE HAVEN'T- REQUIRED THEM

02:51:49.866 --> 02:51:51.534
TO HAVE PUBLIC HEARINGS WITH.

02:51:51.601 --> 02:51:54.871
INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC- I HAVE

02:51:54.937 --> 02:51:56.172
NO IDEA WITH THEM THE MONEY IS

02:51:56.239 --> 02:51:58.608
GOING TO THE CEO. THE

02:51:58.675 --> 02:52:00.977
ORGANIZATIONS ARE WHETHER IT'S

02:52:01.044 --> 02:52:01.811
ACTUALLY GOING INTO VOUCHERS OR

02:52:01.878 --> 02:52:04.781
ANYTHING ELSE- AND FRANKLY IN A

02:52:04.847 --> 02:52:07.350
COUPLE OF THE OF A- OF THE

02:52:07.417 --> 02:52:09.052
AREAS THAT I REPRESENT I BASS

02:52:09.118 --> 02:52:11.521
FOR IT FOR. INFORMATION AND-

02:52:11.587 --> 02:52:14.524
AND QUITE FRANKLY HAVE NOT BEEN.

02:52:14.590 --> 02:52:16.225
WELL RECEIVED ASKING FOR THAT

02:52:16.292 --> 02:52:17.660
INFORMATION AND TO ME IT'S KIND

02:52:17.727 --> 02:52:19.462
OF WHAT I'VE SAID IS LOOK

02:52:19.529 --> 02:52:21.564
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO VOTE. FOR

02:52:21.631 --> 02:52:24.767
MORE MONEY- IT'S A CRISIS WE

02:52:24.834 --> 02:52:26.369
NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT

02:52:26.436 --> 02:52:27.637
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL ME

02:52:27.704 --> 02:52:29.505
WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING AND SO

02:52:29.572 --> 02:52:31.541
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED. ABOUT

02:52:31.607 --> 02:52:34.043
THAT BUT BUT- BUT I APPRECIATE

02:52:34.110 --> 02:52:35.111
YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE

02:52:35.178 --> 02:52:40.316
UNIQUE- IF A STRUCTURE THAT'S

02:52:40.383 --> 02:52:42.351
BEING AT LEAST WHAT WE'VE SEEN.

02:52:42.418 --> 02:52:43.953
SO FAR THIS CUP- CONTEMPLATED

02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:46.956
HERE- IT JUST OCCURRED IT IT

02:52:47.023 --> 02:52:47.724
AFTER HEARING ALL THE

02:52:47.790 --> 02:52:49.492
TESTIMONY. I'M REALLY

02:52:49.559 --> 02:52:50.727
INTERESTED IN WHAT BRILLIANT

02:52:50.793 --> 02:52:52.895
CORNERS IS DOING BECAUSE IT IS

02:52:52.962 --> 02:52:55.765
REALLY INNOVATIVE IT'S A

02:52:55.832 --> 02:52:57.600
DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE

02:52:57.667 --> 02:52:59.902
ISSUE- AND THE IDEA THAT WE

02:52:59.969 --> 02:53:02.505
HAVE MORE HOUSING THAN PEOPLE

02:53:02.572 --> 02:53:04.707
THAT ARE HOMELESS. IS I HAVE

02:53:04.774 --> 02:53:07.043
NOT HEARD ANYBODY SAY THAT SO

02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:09.212
FAR. I'M I'M ON THE HOUSING

02:53:09.278 --> 02:53:11.914
CALIFORNIA BOARD AND I'M

02:53:11.981 --> 02:53:12.949
PROBABLY IN BIG TROUBLE FOR. WE

02:53:13.015 --> 02:53:14.250
NEED TO BUILD A WHOLE LOT OF

02:53:14.317 --> 02:53:15.351
UNITS IT THERE'S NO QUESTION

02:53:15.418 --> 02:53:17.153
ABOUT IT AND I I'VE BEEN A HAVE

02:53:17.220 --> 02:53:18.621
AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATE

02:53:18.688 --> 02:53:19.555
FOR THAT I WON'T TELL YOU HOW

02:53:19.622 --> 02:53:20.523
MANY YEARS BECAUSE I'LL TELL

02:53:20.590 --> 02:53:21.924
YOU HOW OLD I AM BUT- BUT THE

02:53:21.991 --> 02:53:23.993
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT TO KNOW

02:53:24.060 --> 02:53:25.595
THAT THERE ARE VACANCIES I'M-

02:53:25.661 --> 02:53:27.430
WE HAD A PRESENTATION. THAT LED

02:53:27.497 --> 02:53:30.900
ME TO BELIEVE IN LA THAT. THAT

02:53:30.967 --> 02:53:34.237
WHEN PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HOUSING

02:53:34.303 --> 02:53:36.773
BECAUSE OF THE RENT GETS

02:53:36.839 --> 02:53:38.007
INCREASED OR THEY LOSE THEIR

02:53:38.074 --> 02:53:39.742
JOB OR THEY GOT A MEDICAL BILL

02:53:39.809 --> 02:53:40.676
AND NOW THEY CAN'T PAY FOR

02:53:40.743 --> 02:53:42.411
THEIR HOUSING. THAT THOSE ARE

02:53:42.478 --> 02:53:44.080
THE ADDRESS IT THOSE ARE THE

02:53:44.147 --> 02:53:45.848
UNITS THAT PEOPLE ARE THAT ARE

02:53:45.915 --> 02:53:47.617
HOT HOMELESS ARE BEING PLACED

02:53:47.683 --> 02:53:49.886
IN SO THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

02:53:49.952 --> 02:53:52.622
RECYCLING PEOPLE. IN A WAY THAT

02:53:52.688 --> 02:53:54.123
WILL NEVER GET AS THE SITUATION

02:53:54.190 --> 02:53:55.725
AND SO. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT WE

02:53:55.792 --> 02:53:58.161
NEED TO BUILD AND WE NEED TO

02:53:58.227 --> 02:53:59.095
COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT WAY OF

02:53:59.162 --> 02:54:00.196
HOUSING PEOPLE AND I'M- I'M I'M

02:54:00.263 --> 02:54:04.967
INTEREST. BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND

02:54:05.034 --> 02:54:07.970
THAT. THE AND THERE'S A SENSE

02:54:08.037 --> 02:54:09.639
OF HOPELESSNESS THAT WERE EVER

02:54:09.705 --> 02:54:11.174
GOING TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS.

02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:14.410
SO IT IT JUST OCCURS TO ME

02:54:14.477 --> 02:54:16.345
THAT. THAT TAKING IT IN A MUCH

02:54:16.412 --> 02:54:18.214
MORE DELIBERATIVE PROCESS WHERE

02:54:18.281 --> 02:54:21.250
YOU HAVE YOUR MODEL. AND WE

02:54:21.317 --> 02:54:23.119
LOOK AT IT AND TRY TO SEE IF WE

02:54:23.186 --> 02:54:25.621
CAN TRAIN. PEOPLE ALL OVER THE

02:54:25.688 --> 02:54:28.124
STATE TO DO A VERY SIMILAR

02:54:28.191 --> 02:54:31.394
MODEL. IS GOING TO. BE MUCH

02:54:31.460 --> 02:54:33.596
MORE DELIBERATE HAVE AND WE CAN

02:54:33.663 --> 02:54:35.398
MAKE A LONGER TERM COMMITMENT

02:54:35.464 --> 02:54:38.067
TO IT. THAT WILL ALL HAVE THIS

02:54:38.134 --> 02:54:39.802
EELING LIKE WE'RE NOT DOING

02:54:39.869 --> 02:54:41.370
SOMETHING JUST FOR ONE YEAR AND

02:54:41.437 --> 02:54:43.005
THEN WE'RE GOING TO WALK AWAY

02:54:43.072 --> 02:54:43.573
FROM THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE

02:54:43.639 --> 02:54:45.374
SPENT. TWO AND A HALF BILLION

02:54:45.441 --> 02:54:48.077
DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS AND WE

02:54:48.144 --> 02:54:50.012
DIDN'T GET ANYTHING FOR IT AND

02:54:50.079 --> 02:54:52.882
SO ANY ANYWAY I THAT'S- I AM I

02:54:52.949 --> 02:54:53.983
REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:54:54.050 --> 02:54:54.517
DISCUSSION BECAUSE I THINK

02:54:54.584 --> 02:54:57.753
WE'RE- WHAT WE NEED IS THE HOPE

02:54:57.820 --> 02:54:59.822
THAT THERE IS. A PROCESS THAT

02:54:59.889 --> 02:55:02.625
WILL HELP US TO REDUCE THE

02:55:02.692 --> 02:55:04.961
HOMELESS. POPULATION AND THAT

02:55:05.027 --> 02:55:06.596
WE CAN THEN START DEALING WITH

02:55:06.662 --> 02:55:09.532
ALL THESE OTHER- AT DANGERS

02:55:09.599 --> 02:55:10.566
THAT ARE OUT THERE PEOPLE THAT

02:55:10.633 --> 02:55:12.134
ARE AT RISK OF BEING HOMELESS

02:55:12.201 --> 02:55:13.703
FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

02:55:13.769 --> 02:55:14.237
