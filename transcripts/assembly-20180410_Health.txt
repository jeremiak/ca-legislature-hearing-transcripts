THANK YOU MR STEINER. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX SIX TO CLARIFY. SIX TO CLARIFY LIVE EXISTING LINE ORDER TO ALLOW FOR INJURED LAW ENFORCEMENT CANINES TO BE TRANSPORTED TO A VETERINARY HOSPITAL USING AN AMBULANCE. THANKFULLY THIS ISN'T ALL TOO COMMON ISSUE BUT WHEN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANIMALS ARE INJURED THE CURRENT PRACTICE IS TO SCOOP AND RUN WITH THE ANIMAL BY PUTTING THEM IN A POLICE CAR. UNFORTUNATELY THIS ISN'T PRACTICAL OR ADVISE BECAUSE THE ANIMAL CAGES AND POLICE CARS ARE TOO CRAMPED FOR THE ENTERTAINING AND THEIR HANDLER TO FIT AT THE SAME TIME. WHILE THE HAMMER PROVIDES LIFESAVING MEDICAL ATTENTION. I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FOR THE ANALYSIS. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY A VARIETY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC SAFETY ASSOCIATIONS AND THERE IS NO FORMAL OPPOSITION. I AM JOINED TODAY BY OFFICER SCOTT MARTIN AND OFFICER JARED AND FELLOW FROM THE REDONDO BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENTS CANINE UNIT WHO FIRST BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO OUR ATTENTION BACK IN DECEMBER. I'M ARE GOING TO BE. I'VE BEEN A CANINE HAMLET FOR SEVEN YEARS TO OUR PARTNER BY THE NAME RUGER. I HAVE BEEN PUT IN MANY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AFTER MY DOG AND IF EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. WHERE THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INJURY TO HIM AS HIGH? AND IN THE COURSE OF MY CAREER I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THAT. POLICE DOGS INJURED AND KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY AND. SINCE TAKING MET TACK COURSES TOWARDS LIFESAVING TECHNIQUES TOWARDS. SAVING POLICE CANINES I'VE REALIZED THAT SOME OF THE. OBSTACLES I WOULD RUN INTO IS MY SIZE BEING A TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY POUND POLICE OFFICER WITH AN EIGHTY POUND DOG IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM WHERE IF. REQUIRED. MEDICAL. FIRST AID RESPONSE I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING. HIM TO SEE. SURVIVED THE INJURIES AND THEN TRANSPORTING INTO A VETERINARY. A SILLY WHERE HE COULD RISK RECEIVE. ADVANCE MEDICAL CARE SO THAT IS. WHY THIS WAS PROPOSED TO ASSEMBLYMAN STEINORTH? IT WITH ANYONE ELSE. BEACON SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SEEM NO ONE ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION. I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I WAS TOO FAST ON THE. ESOS IN MIND THAT WE PLAY HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION HERE IN SUPPORT OF ABOUT. I THINK IT'S. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANYONE. OKAY YET MISTER BIGELOW. THIS IS JUST BECAUSE I HAVE ONE OF THE SPACE. Y. WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE FUNDING IS GOING TO COME FROM THAT YOU CAN HELP US. ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION OTHER NOT LIKE YOU. YES I'M WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT NOW MY UNDERSTANDING IS FOR THE FUNDING WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THE EXISTING AMBULANCE SERVICES AS THEY ARE. AND. YOU KNOW JUST ALLOWING THIS SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO USE THOSE AYE I DON'T ANTICIPATE WHAT THE COST IS ON THIS. WELL I'LL I'LL WORK WITH YOU ON THAT BUT I THINK IF YOU. ANYONE ELSE. KENDALL SEEMS HE NO ONE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER SENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE OKAY WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM SO WE WILL WILL BRING IT UP AT THAT POINT AND I APPRECIATE COULD SHE BE HERE OFFICER. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK MEMBERS TIME COURSE. MISTER CHAU. FIRST. FIRST BILL UP WITH BEING BE NINETEEN STE EXHIBIT TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SAW. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN WHAT THE IMPLEMENT REASONABLE REGULATIONS FOR THE USE OF DIGITAL HEALTH FEEDBACK SYSTEMS. INCLUDING ITEMS ALSO KNOWN AS STITCHED OAK HILLS. WHILE TECHNOLOGY STANDS TO IMPROVE HOW HEALTH CARE IS THE LIVER. DECENT VANCE MEANS DO NOT COME WITH THE RISK. HEALTH AND MEDICAL INFORMATION IS BY ITS VERY NATURE ON. DEEPLY PERSONAL AND SENSITIVE. NEW TECHNOLOGY MAKES MEDICAL INFORMATION EASILY AND QUICKLY ACCESSIBLE. VIA APPS AND WEBSITES IN CALIFORNIA HAS ENSURE THAT MEDICAL INFORMATION HELD BY MOBILE DEVICES IS PROTECTED. UNDER ALL PRIVACY LAWS. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDER MEDICAL INFORMATION THIS INFORMATION GENERALLY NEEDS TO BE GENERATED BY A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER INFORMATION THAT IS GENERATED BY DIGITAL HEALTH FEEDBACK SYSTEM MEANING. AT THE PATIENT LEVEL AND OUTSIDE OF A MEDICAL FACILITY WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE CAPTURE UNDER THE EXISTING DEFINITION OF MEDICAL INFORMATION. ARE SEVERAL FORMS OF DIGITAL PILLOWS THAT'S. SEND INFORMATION FROM PLACES LIKE THAT DIGESTIVE TRACT WILL BLOOD STREAM OF BEING DEVELOPED. WITH A FEW ALREADY IN USE. THESE THAT DIGITAL PILLS WHICH CUT COMBINED IN JUST ABOUT A MICROCHIP SENSORS WITH A PHARMACEUTICAL WAS CAN OPERATE IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. THEY CAN CONTROL AND MONITOR THE RELEASE OF ACTIVE THOU PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS. ARE AFTER THE GESTION WE CAN ALSO RECORD HOW WHETHER WHEN WHERE AND IN WHAT QUANTITIES A DRUG IS BEING RELEASED. AS WELL AS INFORMATION ABOUT THE PHYSICAL SPEED OF THE PERSON TAKING THE DRUG SUCH AS TEMPERATURE ACTIVE ACTIVITY LEVELS HEART RATE AND RESPIRATION. THIS INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER A PATIENT HOPE HIS OR HER MEDICATION AND HOW THAT IT. AYE MEDICATION INTERACTIVE INTO BODIES IS UNQUESTIONABLY OF A MEDICAL NATURE. SO IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE INFORMATION GENERATED BY DIGITAL HEALTH FEEDBACK SYSTEMS IS CLASSIFIED AS MEDICAL INFORMATION. AND DEVELOPERS AND OPERATORS OF HARDWARE SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CHILL PILLOWS ARE ALREADY PROHIBITED. OFF FROM SHARING THIS INFORMATION WITHOUT THE PATIENT'S INFORMED CONSENT. THIS BILL AB TWENTY ONE SIX SEVEN WHAT DO. DIGITAL HEALTH FEEDBACK SYSTEM TO INCLUDE ITEMS SUCH AS DIGITAL PILLS AND ENSURE THAT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ACT WAS CM I A.. APPLIES TO INFORMATION DERIVED FROM OR IN THE POSSESSION OF THE SYSTEMS THE BILL THE BILL WOULD FURTHER REQUIRE THAT MANUFACTURERS EQUIPPED. ADDITIONAL HEALTH A FEEDBACK SYSTEMS WITH REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE THE SECURITY FEATURES OF THE BILL HAS NO REGISTER. OPPOSITION AND WAS WITH AYE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I'VE. WE CARRY MUCH. IF THE OTHER WITNESSES. OKAY ANYONE EVER OTHERS IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO ONE WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS. I'D JUST ONE COMMENT AND THAT IS. WHILE WE ARE LOOKING AT AT THIS SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY WHAT ON MY HOPE IS THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER LANGUAGE AT SOME POINT. TO BE A LITTLE BROADER SO THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON AN ISSUE LIKE THIS WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT DOING A SPECIFIC BILL FOR A SPECIFIC PRODUCT OR. IT WILL LOOK IN ANY CATEGORY OR LESSON ON ON SOMEBODY'S AND IT'S JUST IT'S JUST ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THAT. MAYBE IT'LL BE WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL BE NEXT YEAR I DON'T I DON'T KNOW AND AND AND MAYBE THE LANGUAGE CAN BE SUCH A WAY THAT THAT. THAT CAN ACTUALLY HAPPEN BUT IN MAY THAT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK PORTANTINO TECHNOLOGY CHANGES RAPIDLY HAVE SILLY BUT. BUT SOMETHING SOMETHING TO CONSIDER IS A THE MOST WORK POINT WELL TAKEN OUT DEFINITELY GOT IN SCHOOL INTEGRATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU AS YOU CAN SEE WE STILL DON'T HAVE A QUORUM. A ALSO WILL BUT YOU HAVE SECOND BILL I DO HAVE A SECOND BILL AND THAT IS. TWENTY NINE THIRTY FIVE LOS. THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ARE AB THIRTY TWENTY NINE THIRTY FIVE WOULD PROHIBIT THE OPERATOR OF A COMMERCIAL. HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM FROM INTENTIONALLY SHARING WITH DISCLOSING IS CONSUMERS ARE INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFY. FIABLE HEALTH MONITORING INFORMATION WITH A THIRD PARTY FIRST WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING THE CONSUMER'S CONSENT THESE ARE WHAT WE CALL FIFTY IT'S. AND DEVICES ARE SIMILAR TO NOT. ON PROTECTION OF MENTAL HEALTH INFORMATION IS AN ESTABLISHED RIGHT WITHIN OUR COUNTRY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY SIX ALSO KNOWN AS HIPAA. PLACES STRICT REQUIREMENTS ON THE SECURING OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION AND ALSO PROVIDES PROTECTION TO CONSUMERS BY GIVING THEM THE RIGHT TO KNOW HEALTH INFORMATION. CALIFORNIA HAS THIS. ADDITIONALLY ESTABLISHED THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION AKKA. CMI ES IN SHORT IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL'S MEDICAL INFORMATION FROM UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE. OF HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAMS HAVE INCREASED IN POPULARITY THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND THESE DEVICES ARE MOST COMMONLY WORN ON ICQ A CONSUMER'S RISK. ARM AND ARE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING CONSIDERABLE HEALTH MONITORING INCLUDING THE TRACKING OF THE CONSUMERS TO HEART RATE BLOOD GLUCOSE AND SLEEPING HABITS. ADDITIONALLY SOME I ENCOURAGE CHAU USERS TO EVEN SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR MOODS AS WELL AS OUR SEXUAL ACTIVITY. WHILE HIPPER AND CMI EIGHT PROVIDE STRONG PROTECTIONS FOR MEDICAL HEALTH INFORMATION THERE'S NOT A SIMILARLY ROBUST FRAMEWORK OF PROTECTIONS FOR HEALTH DATA WHICH IS GENERATED OUTSIDE. OF THE MEDICAL SETTING. IN THIS VOID OPERATORS OF COMMERCIAL HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO SHARE AND OR SELL CONSUMERS PERSONAL. OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH DATA TO THIRD PARTIES. WITH THAT IN MIND ALL THIS BILL AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY FIVE WOULD ESTABLISHED OUT IN ORDER OF TO SHARE A CONSUMERS. ARE PERSONAL PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH MONITORING INFORMATION THAT'S A MOUTHFUL. THE OPERATOR OF A COMMERCIAL HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM MUST FIRST OBTAIN A CONSUMER'S AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT THAT FULFILLS THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS ONE THE REQUEST MUST BE SEPARATE FROM ALL OTHER. AUTHORIZATIONS OR AGREEMENT TO THE CONSENT REQUEST MUST ALSO INCLUDE THE NAME OF A THIRD PARTY AND THE. REASON FOR THE REQUEST AND FINALLY IT MUST BE MAKE CLEAR HOW THAT CONSUMERS REFUSAL TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WILL NOT. PROHIBIT OR LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO USE A. COMMERCIALLY HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM AND FINALLY THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THAT A WAIVER OF ANY A LEGAL RIGHTS A PENALTY REMEDY FLORA OR ENFORCEMENT. MECHANISMS PRESENTED TO THE CONSUMER IN A CONTENT DESCRIBED IS UNENFORCEABLE AND VOID AS A MATTER OF LAW SO WE GOT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR YOUR A SUPPORT AGAIN AND TELL YOU I DON'T. VERY MUCH. IN SUPPORT OTHERS IN SUPPORT. NO ONE IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEE KNOWN AND BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANYTHING. CHáVEZ. I WAS CHAO JUST I DON'T WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH THIS. THAT THE ANALYSIS OF THIS AND ACTUALLY. I GOT SCARED THINKING ABOUT THIS I GUESS I'D NO IDEA THAT THOSE WHO HAVE FITBIT'S. I THAT THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION HAS BEEN COLLECTED CAN BE DISTRIBUTOR TO THIRD PARTIES I THINK OF FRIENDS OF MINE THAT. THAT THAT HAVE THEM AND HAVE SHOWN ME HEY LOOK HERE'S MY SLEEP NOT PATTERNS. AND IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH INDUCTIVE BUT DATA REASONING TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT OTHER PROBLEMS AND WHILE IT'S. IT'S HEALTH RELATED NOT MEDICAL RELATED A YOU CAN DERIVE A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM THAT AND I DON'T THINK THAT CONSUMERS KNOW THAT WHEN THEY'RE. ACQUIRING IT SO I WHILE I UNDERSTAND SOME OF YOU DO SOME OPPOSITION SOME LANGUAGE OPPOSITION. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THAT THE PURPOSE AND INTENT OF YOUR BILL IT IS IS. OF THAT I KNOW I'M AS A WORKS THE PROCESS THERE'S PROBABLY MORE OPPOSITION WITH SOME LANGUAGE AND I'M SURE YOU'LL BE WORKING. WITH SOME OF THOSE STAKEHOLDERS UP BUT I WITH THE INTENT OF WHAT YOU'RE AIMING FOR I'M IN FULL SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KIND AND AND I WILL BE. A WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION OF FROM THIS POINT ON AS WELL I THINK IT'S YOU JACK REYES SOCIETY* AND CONCERNED ABOUT ARBITRATION CLAUSE THERE'S NO INTENTION ON OUR PART TO DO AWAY WITH. ATTRITIONAL HALL AT ALL SO WILL WORK WITH THEM TO US YOU KNOW ON FIGHTING THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S VERY VERY MUCH. WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YES I AGREE AND. THERE'S SO MANY OTHER DEVICES THAT ARE COMING OUT NOW ON THOSE THAT WANT TO CAN REMOVE THE NAME OF IT FOR PEOPLE TO MONITOR THEIR HEART THAT WITH THEIR. FINGERS ON AYE IN THIS YOU KNOW WITHOUT HAVING THE RUSHED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. I'M SURE THINGS LIKE THAT WOULD BE COVERED ALSO UNDER YOUR. YOUR BILL ON THE MORE WE USE TECHNOLOGY THE MORE WE ALLOW FOR THAT KIND OF ACCESS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS OF CAN'T JUST RUN TO A CLINIC IN FIVE MINUTES AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE. DIGITAL HEALTH A LOT OF THINGS LIKE THAT. ON ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S INTERESTING IS I HAVE A FITBIT THAT AWARE SOMETIMES BUT. A LOT OF THE INFORMATION ISN'T REALLY NECESSARILY THAT SCIENTIFIC BECAUSE I FROM IF YOU JUST MOVE YOUR ARM IF GIVES YOU STEPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO CLUB WHEN I HEAR YOU SHOULD TRY. ANYWAY. SO I THINK YOU'RE GOING ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND I'M SURE THERE'S NO BUMPS IN THE ROAD THEY HAVE TO WORK THROUGH BUT YOU KNOW ALL THE SUPPORT OF TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. VERY GOOD AND ANYONE ELSE. I WAS WANTED NEVER WHY. YOU CAN HAVE. A AS AS YOU CAN SEE WE ARE WE'RE STILL COUPLE. PEOPLE SHY OF A. QUORUM BUT WITH YOU BUT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE ANY OTHER FOR THE CLOSING I RESPECTFULLY ASK ARRIVAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THINK SO MUCH FASTER CHAO PRESENTED. AND WE COULD USE SOME AUTHORS. MISS WALDRON. PLEASE GO AHEAD. AND AFTER HIS WALDRON WE COULD USE MARKERS. SO MISS WALDRON WILL BE PRESENTING AB NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I THINK LOU MISSING ONE OF OUR WITNESSES BUT WE CAN STILL PROCEED. I'M HERE TO TODAY TO PRESENT A. B. NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE OPIOID TREATMENT CERTIFICATION ACT. HAS YOU KNOW OPIOID DEPENDENCE IS A LEADING FORM OF DRUG ABUSE. IN THE WORLD. AND AS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF ACCIDENTAL DEATHS IN THE U. S.. MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT ARE MAD AT ME T. IS AN INNOVATIVE TREATMENT PROGRAM THAT USES MEDICATIONS WITH COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES TO TREAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. THIS TREATMENT. PROGRAM HAS SHOWN TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER THAN. EXCLUSIVELY IN PATIENT TREATMENTS DESPITE INCREASING SUCCESS OF MATT. FOR OPIOID ABUSE LESS THAN TWO PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL PROVIDERS. OUR CERTIFIED TO PRESCRIBE BICU PANEL FOR IN THE LOCKS ON TREATMENT AND EVEN LESS A CERTIFIED TO ADMINISTER NALTREXONE. PROVIDING ACCESS TO MEDICATION TO SIT ASSISTED TREATMENT DRUGS IN RURAL AREAS IS PIVOTAL IN MANAGING AN OPIOID EPIDEMIC. HOWEVER THE NUMBER OF CERTIFIED PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA IS FAR LESS THAN WHAT WE NEED. A COMBAT OPIOID ABUSE SO INCREASE ACCESS TO THIS TREATMENT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO INCENTIVIZE MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO BECOME CERTIFIED PRESCRIBERS. IN AN EFFORT TO INCENTIVIZE MORE MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO BECOME CERTIFIED PRESCRIBERS OF MATT. THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR PROVIDERS WHO ARE CERTIFIED TO PRESCRIBE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT DRUGS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND THE PROPER PERCENTAGE TO INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE WILL KEEP THE COMMITTEE A PRIZE WHEN THE NUMBER HAS BEEN DECIDED UPON. WITH ME TODAY. I HAVE TOM RUN FREE FROM COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. AND JOHN WALESA WHO IS HERE TO HELP OUT WITH TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I TOM RENT FREE WITH COUNTY BE ABLE HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THE. AS AS. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON HAS SAID THAT THE. LESSON TWO PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL PROVIDERS ARE A CERTIFIED TO PRESCRIBE THESE MEDICATIONS AND WE KNOW I MEAN. WE'RE ALL AWARE THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN OPIOID. EPIDEMIC WHICH IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND THERE'S REALLY DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS OF THESE MEDICATIONS IN TREATING PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. I'M THERE'S ALSO A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS BOUT. HALF OF THE. RULE COUNTIES HAVE NO NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAM OF PROVIDERS AT ALL AND YET IN SOME OF THESE COUNTIES. THAT SAYS YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN ON THE NEWS THERE ARE MORE OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS BEING WRITTEN IN THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY SO THIS IS A HUGE NEED. OBVIOUS THESE MEDICATIONS WHEN COMBINED WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THERAPIES ARE. ON HOLD PERSON TREATMENT APPROACH. TO TREATING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS BUT TO INCREASE ACCESS. AND TO EXPAND OUR NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVIZE MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO BECOME CERTIFIED PROVIDERS A PUPIL NORTH VIENEN SUBOXONE ARE WE HAVE TO INCREASE THE HISTORICALLY LOW MEDI CAL PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR THE SERVICES AND. A FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE SUPPORT. THIS BILL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JOHN VALENCIA HERE ON BEHALF OF ALL KERN IS INCORPORATED DEL KERMES MANUFACTURERS AND ADDITIONAL MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT LONG ACTING INJECTABLE NALTREXONE. WHICH IS A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ANTAGONISED VERSION WE'RE FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON'S HOLISTIC APPROACH ON MAKING. ALL MEDICATION ASSIST THE TREATMENTS AVAILABLE TO THE RIGHT PATIENT. IN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCE AT THE RIGHT TIME SO WE APPRECIATE HER APPROACH ON THE MEASURE WE FULLY SUPPORT IT THANK YOU. OTHER SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MAKING ALREADY BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. GLAD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WE HAVE REALLY BEEN. WORKING WITH OTHERS AND I AM OUR POSITIONS ON THE MEMBERS TO LOOK TOWARDS I HAVE PREVENTION. AND TREATMENT NOW THAT WE HAVE AND WE ARE IN THIS PLACE REEKS OF MADE SOME GREAT CHANGES THAT ARE PRESCRIBING AND WANT TO LOOK FORWARD TO. HOW WE'RE GOING TO? DEAL WITH THE POPULATION THAT HAS. FALLING VICTIM SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND AND SURE THAT TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND SO I THINK THAT INCENTIVIZING WRITERS IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS CARE. AND. AND. I HAVE. WE FULLY SUPPORT THE BILL AND THE FORGE OF MOVING FORWARD. WE GET HOMELESS FOR SUPPORT. IF YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT JUST TO NAME AN ORGANIZATION SHERRY DAILY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. RENTAL HAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. MR JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S AT PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

WE WILL PUT UP AND. THINK THAT'S PROMOTION AND IT DOESN'T YOU AND IT DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION THINKS THANK YOU MISS WALDRON SO. SEE DOCTOR ARAMBULA ARE YOU READY. COME ON UP SIR. PRESENTING AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER. CHAIRMAN AND. WELCOME MR VICE CHAIR AS WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS. TODAY I AM HERE TO PRESENT ON AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE WHICH IMPROVES ON OUR STATE'S EXISTING MEDICAL LOSS RATIO STANDARDS. AND PRESERVES HOW THESE RATIOS ARE CALCULATED WHICH GUARANTEES A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THE PREMIUM DOLLARS IS SPENT ON CARE. CURRENTLY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PROVIDED MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH HEALTH COVERAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES. THROUGH MEDICAL EXPANSION AND BY MAKING PRIVATE COVERAGE MORE AFFORDABLE. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS BENEFIT FROM STRONG A CA CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT MAKE SURE THAT HEALTH PLAN SPEND A MINIMUM PORTION OF THE PREMIUMS ON CARE. COVER ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS HAVE NO ANNUAL OR LIFETIME LIMITS ON BENEFITS CAP ANNUAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND OFFER COVERAGE ON A GUARANTEED ISSUE BASIS REGARDLESS. PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS AND MANY OTHERS. MUCH OF OUR STATE LAWS THAT IMPLEMENTED THE ACA ACTUALLY EXCEEDED AND IMPROVED UPON THESE HERE. THIS HAS MADE CALIFORNIA A LEADER IN HEALTH CARE REFORM ACROSS THE NATION. OUR CONSUMER CENTERED POLICY DECISIONS HAVE ALSO LED TO RELATIVELY STABLE AND SUCCESSFUL INSURANCE MARKETS. IMPROVING ON THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO STANDARDS THREW AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE IS ANOTHER WAY THAT OUR STATE CAN LEAD AND MAKE THE ACA BETTER FOR OUR CONSUMERS. RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS ESPECIALLY HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS CONTINUE TO BE A CONCERN FOR CONSUMERS. THE AMIL OUR STANDARDS HAVE HELPED TO CURVE. EXCESSIVE HEALTH INSURER PROFITS AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BY CAPPING THESE EXPENSES. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME GUARANTEEING THAT AT LEAST EIGHTY TO EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF PREMIUMS GO TOWARDS ACTUAL MEDICAL CARE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES. AT THE SAME TIME. WE CONTINUE TO SEE HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS MAKE BILLIONS OF PROFITS. EVEN WITH THE STANDARD. WE ALSO HAVE DATA SHOWING THAT MOST HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS MEET AND WILL EXCEED THE CURRENT AND ALL OUR STANDARDS. BOTH OF THESE DEMONSTRATE. THAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO BETTER AND SHOULD IMPROVE THE STANDARDS. AT THE SAME TIME CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALSO PRISONER PRESERVE HOW AMMO OURS ARE CALCULATED. SO THAT MORE OF OUR PREMIUM. DOLLARS ARE SPENT ON ACTUAL CARE AND LESS ON INSURANCE COMPANY PROFITS AND OVERHEAD. AS A PHYSICIAN I AM COMMITTED TO ENSURING THE MOST OF OUR PREMIUM DOLLARS GO TOWARDS MEDICAL CARE AND NOT ON ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD. WITH ME TO TESTIFY AND SUPPORT HER MARRIED JUNE FLOREZ FROM HEALTH ACCESS AS WELL AS JIM FLORI FROM THE WESTERN CENTER OF LONG POVERTY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARY JANE FLOORS AND ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA. THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION WORKING ON AFFORDABLE AND QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT. AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE WHICH WOULD RAISE OUR STATE'S MEDICAL LOSS RATIO SANDERS IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND LARGE GROUP MARKETS AND ALSO CODIFY OBAMA ERA REGULATIONS IN OUR STATUTES. EVERY OTHER ACA RELATED LAW THAT CALIFORNIA HAS PASSED HAS BEEN MORE PROTECTIVE AND MORE CONSUMER CENTRIC. THE STATE'S MLR STANDARD IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT WE CAPTAIN REFERRED TO FEDERAL RULES WHICH THAT THE FLOOR. SIMILAR TO NATIONAL DATA MOST CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS HAVE EXCEEDED THE AMONG OUR STANDARDS AND RESET TWENTY SIXTEEN FINANCIAL DATA THAT PLAN SUBMITTED TO THE DAMAGE THE. SHOW ABOUT ALL OF THE PLANS OFFERING COVERAGE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET MATT AND EXCEEDED THE EIGHTY TWENTY MLR. NOW THAT WE HAVE A FEW YEARS WORTH OF EXPERIENCE IN DATA WE CAN IMPROVE UPON THESE MINIMUM MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS AND ACTUALLY RAISE THEM. ADDITIONALLY IT IS A POINT TO CODIFY OBAMA HERE RULES ON HOW AND MILLERS ARE CATCHY LESION POPULATED WHICH IS WHAT THE STATE HAS USED FOR YEARS. FINAL ELEMENTS THAT WERE CONSIDERED IN THE CALCULATIONS WENT THROUGH A RIGOROUS PROCESS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND NOW THEY ARE THEY ARE AT RISK OF BEING CHANGED DUE TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. LASTLY WE ARE AWARE AND SO I ANALYZE THE IN A RECENT FIVE HUNDRED PAGE FEDERAL RULE THAT WAS JUST PUBLISHED YESTERDAY THAT PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO THE STATE. SPECIFICALLY ON MEDICAL LOSS RATIO. DESPITE FEDERAL ACTIONS LET'S KEEP CALIFORNIA AT THE FOREFRONT AND LEADER IN IMPROVING UPON THE ACA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THINK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AND GEN FLOOR WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY STATEWIDE LEGAL SERVICES SUPPORT CENTER AND A MEMBER OF THE HEALTH CONSUMER ALLIANCE THAT SERVES CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WHO NEED HELP WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS LOW INCOME CONSUMERS NOW USE MEDICARE HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE EMPLOYER SPONSORED COVERAGE OR HAVE TO PURCHASE THEIR OWN THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA OR ON THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. AND ARE THUS PAYING AT LEAST A PORTION IF NOT ALL OF THEIR PREMIUM. ADDITIONALLY SOME LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS STILL DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HELP THE MEDI CAL THE COVER CALIFORNIA WEATHER BECAUSE OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS OR BECAUSE OF FEDERAL REGULATION THAT CREATED A PROBLEM KNOWN AS THE FAMILY GLITCH. FEDERAL REGULATIONS ONLY LOOK TO THE COST OF EMPLOYER COVERAGE PROVIDED TO THE EMPLOYEE WHEN LOOKING AT WHETHER EMPLOYER COVERAGE IS AFFORDABLE. THIS MEANS SOME SPOUSES AND CHILDREN OF EMPLOYEES ARE OFFERED COVERAGE THAT IS TOO EXPENSIVE FROM AN EMPLOYER BUT THEY ALSO CANNOT GET EXTRA HELP BUYING INSURANCE FROM COVER CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR PARTNERS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE HELPED A CLIENT WHO IS OFFERED KAISER COVERAGE FROM HIS RESTAURANT EMPLOYER FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH. HOWEVER THE COVERAGE FOR HIS SPOUSE TO JOIN HIS POLICY WOULD THAT COST AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH. THIS FAMILIES TOTAL INCOME IS TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS A MONTH. SO THAT'S WELL OVER A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME. BECAUSE HUSBAND'S COVERAGE WAS CONSIDERED AFFORDABLE SEES. THAT IS CONSIDERED AFFORDABLE IF SHE WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE FROM COVER CALIFORNIA. HER ONLY OTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO PURCHASE AN UNSUBSIDIZED POLICY AND THE CHEAPEST POLICIES IN HER REGION STARTED AROUND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS THERE WITH A SIXTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE. LEAVING THIS FAMILY LESSEN TWO THOUSAND A MONTH TO PAY FOR ALL OTHER EXPENSES SUCH AS RENT TRANSPORTATION UTILITIES AND FOOD AND STILL BE EXPOSED TO HIGH MEDICAL EXPENSES. SHOULD THE MEDICAL LOSS STAND RATIO STANDARDS BE LOWERED OR NOT ENFORCED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THESE CALIFORNIANS WILL BE COMPLETELY BLOCKED OUT OF THE MARKET. CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR PREMIUMS WHETHER THROUGH EMPLOYER COVERAGE OR ON THEIR OWN ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO ANY INCREASE IN INSURANCE PREMIUMS. HOWEVER FROM TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN HEALTH PLAN PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED ON AVERAGE OF NINE PERCENT A YEAR YET WAGES TO NOT INCREASED BY THE SAME AMOUNT. WHILE OTHER COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES ARE NEEDED THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO REQUIREMENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT PIECE AND KEEPING PREMIUMS DOWN KEEPING HEALTH PLANS ACCOUNTABLE AND KEEPING HEALTH COVERAGE AND REACH FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR THE SPONSORS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. IF YOU THINK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA TAKE A ROLE HERE OF THIS WE HAVE A QUORUM SO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE TAKE THE ROLE WHAT HERE. MASS. ANGER CURRY. BIGELOW. BONTA. BURKE. CARILLO. FLORA. LIMON.

YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE. NO ONE. MISSION. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS. WERE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE. WHICH PLACES A NEW IN EXCESS OF MEDICAL LOSS RATIO REQUIREMENT ON HEALTH PLANS THAT EXCEEDS IN CONFLICTS WITH REQUIREMENTS OF EXISTING LAW AND REGULATIONS. INCLUDING THOSE UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THIS BILL WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF DESTABILIZING CALIFORNIA'S MARKET. AND DOES NOTHING TO LOWER MEDICAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IT ALSO DOES NOTHING TO COVER EVEN ONE ADDITIONAL UNINSURED CALIFORNIAN. NOW BY WAY OF BACKGROUND HEALTH PLANS CONTINUE TO BE COMMITTED TO MAKING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WORKING CALIFORNIA. IN OUR COLLECTIVE EFFORTS OF HAVE PRODUCED SOME PRETTY SOLID RESULTS. COVERED CALIFORNIA FOR INSTANCES PERFORMING MUCH BETTER THAN THE FEDERALLY BASED EXCHANGES. WHEN IT COMES TO PLAN PARTICIPATION LEVELS AND PREMIUMS. THIS RELATIVE STABILITY IS DO TO A BROAD BASE OF ENROLLMENT. AND CONSUMER CHOICE IN MOST AREAS OF THE STATE. HAVING SAID THIS A RASH OF FEDERAL POLICIES. MOST RECENTLY THE ELIMINATION OF THE OF INEFFECTIVE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WILL CHALLENGE OUR COLLECTIVE SUCCESSES. WHILE THESE CHALLENGES CAN BE OVERCOME. ADDING AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE MLR REQUIREMENT WILL TAKE IS DECIDEDLY IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND WILL CREATE ITS OWN DESTABILIZING AFFECT. THIS BILL DOES NOT SEND A REASSURING SIGNAL TO THE MARKET AT A TIME OF UNCERTAINTY. SOME HEALTH PLANS MAY DETERMINE THAT THE NEW REQUIREMENTS WILL LEAD TO THE TYPE INANCIAL LOSSES THAT ARE UNSUSTAINABLE. AT THE VERY TIME WE NEED TO ENSURE CONSUMERS HAVE CHOICE. THIS OUTCOME WOULD BE PARTICULARLY BAD NEWS IN AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE CURRENTLY SERVED BY ONLY ONE OR TWO HEALTH PLANS. WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE NUMBER OF ISSUERS OFFERING COVERAGE OF YOUR COVERED CALIFORNIA HAS DECLINED OVER TIME. THIS BILL IS NOT HELPFUL IF WE HOPE TO REVERSE THAT TREND. FEDERAL MEDICAL LOSS RATIO REGULATIONS ENACTED UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WISELY ANTICIPATE THE POTENTIAL FOR MARKET IMPACTS. STIPULATING THAT BEFORE STATES IT'S A HIGHER MINIMUM MLR. THE STATE QUOTE MUST SEEK TO ENSURE ADEQUATE PARTICIPATION BY HEALTH INSURER CHURNS ISSUERS. AND COMPETITION IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET IN THE STATE. AMONG OTHER THINGS. NEW REGULATIONS RELEASED YESTERDAY CLARIFY THAT A STATE SUBMITTING A REQUEST FOR AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. MEDICAL LOSS RATIO STANDARD MUST SUBMIT DATA FOR EACH ISSUE WHERE THEY'RE ACTIVELY OFFERS COVERAGE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET IN THE STATE. AND BROKEN DOWN INTO SPECIFIED CATEGORIES INCLUDING WHETHER THE ISSUE WERE OR NEW ENTRANT HAS PROVIDED NOTICE. ABOUT WHETHER IT'LL BE OFFERING COVERAGE IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR IN THE ENTIRE. OR THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. ACCORDING TO THESE REGULATIONS IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT A STATE CAN AUTOMATICALLY OR REPLACE THE MINIMUM FEDERAL AND ALL OUR REQUIREMENTS. AND IN ANY CASE MARKET STABILIZATION IS KIND OF THE NEXUS THERE. BUT THE PROPONENTS OF TWENTY FOR NINETY NINE ARE WORRIED THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SEEKING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR STATES TO LOWER THE MLR. FIRST I PERSONALLY FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE CALIFORNIA RUSHING TO LOWER ITS MLR BECAUSE THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION SAID IT COULD. AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS WILL HAPPEN SECOND IF THAT'S THE CONCERN WE ARE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE AUTHOR TO. WORK ON WAYS TO PROTECT OUR CURRENT MEDICAL LOSS RATIO STANDARDS I'M FROM FEDERAL I'M FEDERAL INCURSIONS. I'M ENCLOSING WE BELIEVE THEY'RE MORE PRODUCTIVE ACTIONS OF CALIFORNIA CAN TAKE TO STABILIZE OUR MARKET. ACTIONS ARE MUCH LESS HARMFUL THIS BILL AND. WE HAVE WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS INSTEAD OF THIS. Y. WE'D ASK VOTE NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU I SEE TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ARSES ONE OKAY THANK YOU ARCTIC. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS STATE PLANE OR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH UNDERWRITERS WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S AMENDMENTS OUTLINED AT THE ANALYSIS AND FEEL THAT IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN AND ALL I WOULD HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON THE COST AND STABILITY OF THE LARGE. AN INDIVIDUAL MARKETS. WE'RE PROUD OF OUR AGENTS ROLE IN MAKING CALIFORNIA'S EXCHANGE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN THE COUNTRY. WHERE ONE OF THE FEW STATES WITH MARKET STABILITY AND CHOICE WHICH HAS BEEN A HUGE PART OF THAT SUCCESS? WE WOULD ECHO THE MARKET IS STABILIZATION COMMENT SHARED BY THE PLANS AND WELL MARKET DESTABILIZATION SEEMS TO BE A DISTANT TERM IT'S VERY REAL FOR AGENTS ON THE FRONT LINES. WHO NEED TO HELP INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE JUST TOLD THEIR INSURER IS NO LONGER SERVING THEIR REACH? THIS WAS RECENTLY THE CASE LAST YEAR WHEN AT THE BLUE CROSS OF CALIFORNIA WITH YOUR FROM SIXTEEN. OF CALIFORNIA'S NINETEEN PRICING REGIONS AND HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE LOST THEIR HEALTH CARE. THIS COMMITTEE IS LOOKING AT OTHER LEGISLATION RELATING TO THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF MARKET CONSOLIDATION AND A LACK OF ACCESS IN RURAL AREAS. PLEASE ALSO CONSIDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN REVIEWING THIS LEGISLATION AS WELL. WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE AT THIS TIME THAT WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO PARTNERING WITH THE AUTHOR. AND HIS COMMENDABLE EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE COST OF HEALTH CARE AND IMPROVE ACCESS. STEPHANIE WATKINS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION COMPANY LIKE AND HOW. HE'S A. JOHN WHEN YOU'RE ON BEHALF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS AN ANTHEM BLUE CROSS WOULD A LINER COMETS OF CAP. SHERRI MCCUE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. KEVIN DE DUTTY REPRESENTING AETNA WERE OPPOSED THANK YOU. THE IN CHECK WITH HEALTH THAT IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AARON NORWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS OF CALIFORNIA ALSO AND. ANYONE ELSE. SEEN KNOWN A BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISS WALDRON. SERVER MAYBE A CLARIFICATION FROM THE OPPOSITION. THE TOKEN. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES ARE REGULATIONS GOVERNING MLR REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACA. STIPULATE THAT BEFORE STATE SETS A HIGHER MINIMUM MLR THE STATE MUST SEEK TO ENSURE ADEQUATE PARTICIPATION BY HEALTH INSURERS. COMPETITION IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET IN THE STATE AND VALUE FOR CONSUMERS SO THAT PREMIUMS ARE USE FOR CLINICAL SERVICES OF QUALITY. IMPROVEMENTS. IN OTHER WORDS A SAY CAN AUTOMATICALLY REPLACE THE FEDERAL OF FOR ALL OUR REQUIREMENTS CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE. MOON MAYBE EXPAND ON IT BUT. RIGHT SO. BEFORE STATE CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO CERTAIN THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN. AT LEAST THAT'S ACCORDING TO OUR READ OF EXISTING FEDERAL REGULATIONS NOW OF THEIR NEW REGULATIONS ARE WE SHE JUST YESTERDAY'S OR STILL TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE. BUT CLEARLY THE PROCESS FOR MAKING AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE M. L. ARE. REQUIRES THAT A STATES TAKE CERTAIN ACTION INCLUDING MAKING MARKET IMPACT. SOME WILL BE AND IT REQUIRES THE STATE TO. BASICALLY SURVEY. THE STATE'S. HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS. TO DETERMINE WHAT THE POTENTIAL. MARKET IMPACTS COULD BE. RELATIVE TO EACH SPECIFIC ISSUE WERE. AND SO. THAT IS A PROCESS THAT HAS TO PLAY OUT. OUR READERS THAT THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO PETITION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS. IT'S STILL EARLY WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE RAGS. THAT THERE WERE JUST ISSUED YESTERDAY BUT AS YOU SAID CLEARLY UNDER THE. ABOUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WOULD YOU SHOULD THE INITIAL MEDICAL LOSS RATIO REGULATIONS THE STATE HOUSE TO MAKE FINDINGS ABOUT WHAT THE MARKET IMPACT WILL BE. BEFORE IT. IT BEFORE TO JUST THEM MEDICAL LOSS RATIO HIGHER AND THAT REGULATION THAT YOU ARE CITED ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON IS SPECIFIC TO ADJUSTMENTS MAKING THEM MEDICAL LOSS RATIO HIGHER. ANYONE ELSE. DOCTOR REGULAR. FIRST OF ALL HAVE YOU IT DID YOU HAVE ACCEPT OUR AMENDMENTS YES YOU DID OKAY THREATENS OTIS MY APOLOGIES OKAY. THIS WILL SAVE YOU KNOW I DO. FOR FOR A. LET YOU. CLOSE I WANT IS MY SAVED WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT. THE. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECENTLY. CAME OUT WITH A FIVE HUNDRED PAGE RULE. WITCHES FASCINATING IS ALRIGHT BUT. IT WHICH INCLUDE A DISCUSSION OF WITH REALART REGARDS HIM ALL ARE AND SO WE WILL BE LOOKING CLOSELY AT THAT AS WELL. AND AS I SUSPECT THE AUTHOR WILL BE MOVING FORWARD SO. APPRECIATE PRECEDED THAT HAS COME UP MULTIPLE TIMES HERE. I DO SUPPORT MOVIE FOR WITH BUILT THIS POINT AND. WE WILL. ASK IF. ANYONE IS GOING TO BE. ABLE TO MAKE A MOTION. THE BILL AFTER YOU CLOSE. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND IF I MAY I'D REALLY WANTED TO ADDRESS ONE POINT FROM THE OPPOSITION. WHICH WAS. THAT WE WOULD BE SETTING UP AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AND MILLAR'S THEIR QUOTE. AND I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT RIGHT NOW A MAJORITY OF THE HEALTH PLANS ARE CURRENTLY EXCEEDING. THE PROPOSED INCREASED AMOUNT. THREE OUT OF THE ELEVEN. INDIVIDUAL MARKET PLANTS WOULD NOT MEET BASED ON OUR CURRENT ANALYSIS. AND OLD MAJORITY OF THE PLANTS WOULD EXCEED THAT IN THE LARGE GROUP. THEY'RE DOING THAT TODAY. WHAT I'M ASKING THIS COMMITTEE IS TO CODIFY OUR CURRENT OBAMA ERA? M. O. LARS AND TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF INCREASING THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO. BASED OFF OF THE HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE ON THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WITH THAT I HUMBLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WE FOR PART OF LOOKING LOOKING FOR A MOTION. THE MOTION BY MISTER HIS AIRINA SECOND BY MR MCCARTY. MADAM SECRETARY THAT NOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO PREPARATIONS SPENT SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES. MAYES NO AGAR CURRY. ANCHOR CURRY AYE BILBO. BIGELOW NO BONTA. BURKE. CARILLO. FLORA. FLORA KNOW. THE MONTH. MOAN AYE MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE MISSOURIAN. NAZARIAN AYE RODRIGUEZ. SANTIAGO. BERMAN. WALDRON. WALDRON NO. THAT'S IT'S A FIVE TO FOUR AND WILL. COME BACK TO THAT WE HAVE MORE MEMBERS THINKING STRAIGHT EVERY MUCH TALKED ARAMBULA. MISTER GREGG. MR GREY WILL BE PRESENTING AB TWENTY TWO OH THREE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN. MEMBERS. THANK YOU. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT AB% TWENTY TWO OH THREE HERE TODAY. OF THIS MEASURE SEEKS TO CODIFY AND MAKE PERMANENT. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S MEDICAID FEE BOMB WHICH CALIFORNIA ALLOWED TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF TWENTY FOURTEEN. MORE THAN THIRTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS NEARLY A THIRD OF THE STATE'S POPULATION IS SERVED BY MEDICARE. WITH NEARLY FIVE MILLION GAINING COVERAGE SINCE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TOOK EFFECT. WE THE MEDI CAL PATIENTS. POPULATION LARGER THAN THE POPULATION OF PENNSYLVANIA CALIFORNIA HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS. TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT THE PROGRAM WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE INADEQUACIES THAT EXIST ONCE ENROLLEES SEEK TO ACCESS CARE. THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES REPORT WERE REPORTED. I DIFFICULTY FINDING A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER THIS IS COMPARED TO JUST THIRTEEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH OTHER FORMS OF COVERAGE. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN UCSF FOUND THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF POSITIONS SERVING MEDI CAL PATIENTS DECREASED BY FIVE PERCENT OVER JUST TWO YEARS. THE REASONS FOR THESE ACCESS CHALLENGES ARE MULTIFACETED. BUT ONE OF THE GLARING WEAKNESSES IN MEDI CAL IS THE UNACCEPTABLE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. IN TWENTY ELEVEN MEDICARE PAYMENT RATES TO REVISE WERE CUT BY TEN PERCENT TO BALANCE THE STATE'S BUDGET. DESPITE THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY SINCE THE RECESSION POSITIONS PAYMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN RESTORED. EVEN BEFORE THE TWENTY ELEVEN CUTS CALIFORNIA PROVIDE ONE OF THE LOWEST REIMBURSEMENT RATES OF ANY STATE RANKING FORTY SEVENTH IN THE NATION FOR TRADITIONAL FEE FOR SERVICE PAYMENTS. MEDICARE REIMBURSES JUST EIGHTEEN DOLLARS FOR A VISIT TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE. LESS THAN HALF OF THE MEDICARE RATE OF FORTY FIVE DOLLARS. NOT ONLY DO LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES. DISINCENTIVE EYES DOCTORS FROM PRACTICING IN THE AREAS OF THE STATE MOST IN NEED OF THEIR SERVICES. THEY ALSO RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF EXISTING DOCTORS XIN ACCEPTING MEDICAL PATIENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. CONGRESS AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZE THE LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE PRIMARY BECAUSE OF ACCESS TO CARE ISSUES. THE ACA MANDATED FUNDED THE MEDICAID FEE BOP. WHICH BROUGHT MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR PRIMARY CARE. IN LINE WITH MEDICARE. WHEN CALIFORNIA. ALLOWED THE HIGHER RATES TO EXPIRE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. CALIFORNIA DOCTOR SERVING MEDI CAL PATIENTS SAW THEIR PAYMENTS DROPPED BY ALMOST SIXTY PERCENT. AB TWENTY TWO OR THREE RESTORED THESE HIGHER RATES FOR PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. AS CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO MAKE EXPANDING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PRIORITY WE MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR WORK DOES NOT AND WITH COVERAGE. MEDI CAL IS NO LONGER JUST A SAFETY NET PROGRAM IS THE PRIMARY FORM HEALTH INSURANCE FOR A THIRD OF OUR POPULATION. IN ORDER ENSURE THEY RECEIVE CARE WE MUST PRIORITIZE OUR MEDI CAL. TO THE SAME DEGREE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRIORITIZE AS MEDICARE. AB TWENTY TWO OR THREE IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA. WE'VE HAD NO OPPOSITION UP TO THIS POINT ON A PERSONAL NOTE MEMBERS. IN MY HOME COUNTY OF MERCED OVER HALF THE POPULATIONS ON MEDICARE. AND IT IS. HYPOCRITICAL. FOR THIS INSTITUTION. AND OUR GOVERNMENT BOAT HERE IN THE STATE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO CLAIM. THAT WERE. GETTING COVERAGE TO FOLKS WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHEN PEOPLE IN COMMITTEES LIKE MINE CAN GET IN TO SEE A DOCTOR. WE'RE PATTON OURSELVES ON THE BACK IS IF WE'VE DONE SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY BRING CARE TO PEOPLE IN THE REALITIES THEY CAN'T GET IN TO SEE HIM. IT'S TIME TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. AND SUPPORT A BILL THAT WILL ACTUALLY ALLOW FOLKS IN RURAL CALIFORNIA AND ALL CALIFORNIANS TO ACCESS THESE MEDI CAL. SERVICES SO MARROW WITH THAT WHICH SHALL RESPECT LAST YEAR I DON'T. IT VERY MUCH MISTER GRAY. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHEN MEMBERS NEAR ABOUT THAT'S WHAT HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. Q.. I'M SORRY TO. SORRY DIRTY HEX REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS AND SUPPORT IT NO HE WANTED TO GET IT. TWO MINUTES FOR JUSTICE. I I MEAN I I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO ADD TO WHAT OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALREADY SPOKE OF I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT. HIGHER MEDICAL RATES MAKE BETTER OUTCOMES I WOULD JUST ADD. THAT NATIONAL SAID AFTER THE ACA IMPLEMENTED THE THE FEE BOMB THEY DID DO A NATIONAL STUDY ON SEVERAL STATES AND IT DID SHOW THAT AND IMPROVED WAIT TIMES. AND ACCESS TO CARE DID GET BETTER. SO WITH THAT WE SUPPORT THANK YOU. THE CHAIR MEMBERS SERAPH LOCKS ON THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THAT PRIMARY CARE BY UP TO MEDICARE RIGHT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MICHELLE BACO AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AYE WE ARE ACTUALLY WE HAVE A SUPPORTIVE COMMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL I'M WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THE BILL OBVIOUSLY BUT. WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO SEE AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD. ALLOW ALL PHYSICIANS THAT PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE SERVICES TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT INCREASED. AYE WE ARE. LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS ISSUE AND THANK YOU AND I LIKE IT'S IT'S PUT COMMENDED THINKS. JUST NAME ORGANIZATION PLEASE UP WEST SANDS UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MICHELLE CAPITA WITH A CA YOU CALIFORNIA OUTSIDE SUPPORT. PATRICIA WENT SO PLAIN OLD CITIZEN IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. A DARK CIPOLLA PLAIN OLD LOBBYIST FOR THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS. THOUGH WE HAVE A SUPPORT AMENDED LIKE OUR COLLEGES CMA WE THINK REIMBURSEMENT RATES SHOULD BE ACROSS THE BOARD FOR PRIMARY CARE SPECIALIST WITH RESPECT TO MEDICAL MEDICARE. THANK YOU. YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO ONE TO BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ITS ABSURDITY. IT'S BEEN THE MOVE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED TO. MOVE FIVE MISTER MAYES SECONDED BY MISTER BIGELOW ICE ONE SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD MISTER GRAY. LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR OF THAT AT SOME POINT IF YOU. ALLOW ME THAT. AND IF WE HAVE TO TAKE YOU HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WE HAVE THE SAME ISSUES WE HAVE THE SAME ISSUES AND OUR COMMUNITIES. COUNTIES WITH NEAR FOR FOR THE NEAR FIFTY PERCENT OF ON MEDI CAL HAVING DIFFICULT TIMES GETTING IN TO SEE DOCTORS. AND IT IS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RATES SO SPECIFIED IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE FOR THE FOR SERVICE PROGRAMS I THINK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT. TO RURAL CALIFORNIA AND I BRING THIS ISSUE FORWARD THANKS SO MUCH. BUT THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION. AND BY MISTER MAYES A SECOND BY MISTER BIGELOW IT IS TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WOULD I WOULD I MAYES MAYES AYE ACTOR CURRY. BAKER CURRY AYE BIGELOW.

THE CONSENT CALENDAR INCLUDES ITEMS NUMBER FIVE AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY FOUR BY MISS WALDRON. ITEMNUMBER NINE AB TWENTY THREE NINETY THREE A HEALTH COMMITTEE BILL ITEM NUMBER TEN. AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY BY MR CHIU. MINUTES SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WOULD I WOULD I MAYES. EGGER CURRY ACTOR CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BIGELOW AYE BONTA. BURKE. BURKE I CARILLO FLORA. FLORA EILEMA. MCCARTY. PARTY AYE NAZARIAN. RODRIGUEZ SANTIAGO BERMAN WALDRON. WALDRON AYE. SO IT SEVEN WITH THAT WILL BE THOUGH THAT WOULD BE ON COFFEE. SO MISS MISS FRIEDMAN YOU HAVE BEFORE US AB TWENTY SEVENTEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS EVEN THIS FAMILIES TRANSITION OUT OF CHO WORKS AS THEIR INCOME GROWS FROM EMPLOYMENT. ACCESSING RETAINING MEANINGFUL HEALTHCARE COVERAGE IS A CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGE. THE CHEAPEST COVER CALIFORNIA PLAN HAS AN INDIVIDUAL DEDUCTIBLE OF SIXTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN A FAMILY DEDUCTIBLE OF TWELVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE MAXIMUM CASH ASSISTANCE FOR A FAMILY UNDER CAO WORKS JUST SEVEN HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH. AND A PROGRAM AND THE PROGRAM WRIST ARM AND PROGRAM RESTRICTIONS MEAN THAT A FAMILY CANNOT HAVE MORE THAN TWENTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IN THE BANK ACCOUNT. EVEN WITH THE TAX SUBSIDIES AND COST SHARING REDUCTIONS AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU COVER CALIFORNIA THE MATH JUST DOESN'T WORK. AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN ALLIANCE CALIFORNIA POLICY WITH WHAT'S ALLOWABLE UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND SET OF EXISTING SET A EXISTING SIX MONTH WINDOW PER TRANSITIONAL MEDICAL COVERAGE AN OPTION FOR AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTH EXTENSION OF THE FAMILY MAKES INCOME REQUIREMENTS. FAMILIES LEAVING CAO WORKS WOULD HAVE TWELVE MONTHS OF TRADITIONAL MEDICAL COVERAGE. AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS ALL TOO WELL KEEPING CALIFORNIANS HEALTHY DEPENDS UPON ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY HEALTHCARE. FOR FAMILIES STILL STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET AFTER LEAVING HOW WORKS MEDI CAL PROVIDES A SAFETY NET OF HEALTHCARE COVERAGE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I WROTE. MOVE THE BILL. I'VE A WITNESS HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT JAN FLOREY PUT THE WESTERN CENTER OF LAW PARTY. GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLER WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WHERE STATEWIDE LEGAL SERVICES SUPPORT CENTER REPRESENTING LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND WE FOCUS BOTH ON THE MEDI CAL AND THE COW WORKS PROGRAMS. WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN WHICH WOULD ALLOW FAMILIES EXITING CAO WORKS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A TWELVE MONTH TRANSITIONAL MEDI CAL. PERIOD RATHER THAN THE CURRENT SET UP WHICH IS THE SIX MONTH PLUS IN INCOME CHECK AND THEN ANOTHER SIX MONTH PERIOD. ALLOWING FAMILIES EXITING CAO WORKS TO KEEP MEDI CAL FOR TWELVE MONTHS REGARDLESS OF INCOME WOULD ENABLE MORE FAMILIES TO MOVE OUT OF POVERTY BY PRETTY PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL BUFFER PERIOD. WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS ARE OUT OF POCKET COSTS. FAMILIES TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR TAX SUBSIDIES UNCOVER CALIFORNIA STILL PAY FACE HIGH OUT OF POCKET COST SUCH AS COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES. AS MENTIONED THE CHEAPEST COVER CALIFORNIA PLAN HAS A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE OF SIXTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHEN YOU COMPARE THIS TO THE ALLOWABLE ASSETS IN THE CAO WORKS PROGRAM. JUST BY BEING ON IT THE COW WORKS PROGRAM FAMILIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE MORE THAN TWENTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IN SAVINGS SO NO FAMILY EXITING CAO WORKS IS GOING TO IMMEDIATELY HAVE SIXTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN SAVINGS ON HAND. ADDITIONALLY WHEN THAT FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN ON CAL WORKS DO YOU FIND HIGHER PAYING WORK THAT WOULD MAKE HIM ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL THEY STILL HAVE EITHER CONSIDERABLE DEBT TO RESOLVE. OR CONSIDERABLE UNMET NEEDS. TO PUT INTO CONTEXT IF A FAMILY OF THREE CAN ONLY HAVE A CASH GRANT OF SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN DOLLARS THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO PAY FOR RENT OR OTHER NECESSITIES. FAMILIES GET BY BY BORROWING FROM FRIENDS FAMILY MEMBERS OR PAYDAY LENDERS OR THEY SIMPLY GO WITHOUT REPLACING BROKEN APPLIANCES ARE BEING ABLE TO APPLY BY THEIR CHILDREN APPROPRIATE. SHOES CLOTHING AND SCHOOL SUPPLIES OR HAVE RENT AND OTHER BILLS THAT ARE OVERDUE. GIVEN THIS DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE ASSISTANCE THAT'S AVAILABLE ON CAL WORKS AND WHAT FAMILIES ACTUALLY NEED IT CAN TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR TO RECOVER ONCE THEY'RE EARNING ENOUGH TO BE INELIGIBLE FOR COWARDS AND MEDICARE. FINALLY. REMOVING THE SIX MONTH ELIGIBILITY CHECK ALSO ENSURES CRACKS JUST BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO TURN IN A PIECE OF PAPER. AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN IS A NECESSARY STEP TO ALLOW FAMILIES MOVING OFF CAL WORKS TO STABILIZE OUR INCOME AND STILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS NEEDED HEALTH SERVICES. FOR THE SPIRIT REASONS WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE AND WE THINK ASSEMBLYMAN MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. YOU VERY MUCH THE OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MARY VALDEZ WITH HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO ONE IS HOME SORRY NEVER MIND I'M. OR. YES SIR. THEY'VE DONE THIS A LONG TIME AGO. RAIN HICKS CALIFORNIA DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA LINES TO RETIRED AMERICANS ITS STRONG SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. QUESTION. ME BEING A BLEEDING HEART THAT CONSERVATIVE. BUT DEMOS LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES IT'S A TO TRY TO. TO INCENTIVIZE WELL FOLKS FROM GETTING OFF OF A COW WORKS OR OF THEIR INCOME WORKS TO BE GET EDUCATION. A TO PROVIDE ITS I DON'T WANT TO DIS INCENTIVIZE THEM. A TO GET OFF OF OF CAL WORKS AND SO CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE ONE OF THOSE I MEAN LOOKS LIKE THE COST COULD BE. AND I KNOW THE SUPPOSED HE COMMITTEE. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE COST COULD BE A IN THE MID MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. AND SO YOU WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN BETWEEN THAT SURE. THE COST ACTUALLY WOULDN'T BE THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF FAMILIES COMING OFF CAL WORKS ACTUALLY MOVING TO ANOTHER MEDI CAL PROGRAM UNDER THE MATCH AYE RUBRIC. SO THERE AT ELIGIBLE OTHERWISE WHAT THIS DOES IS CREATES A BUFFER FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL GONE ABOVE THAT A LITTLE MORE SO IT DOES CREATE AN INCENTIVE TO NOT ONLY FIND A JOB TO FIND A JOB THAT PAYS WELL. AND STILL HAVE A YEAR BUFFER PERIOD IN WHICH YOU CAN STABILIZE OUR FINANCES AND MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE. WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE EIGHT CODES ON ANY GIVEN MONTH THERE'S ROUGHLY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF TRANSITIONAL MEDI CAL SO IT'S NOT HUGE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE THIRTEEN AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE WE HAVE ON MEDI CAL. THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE IT TO THAT SECOND SIX MONTHS THERE'S ONLY AROUND THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE A MONTH. DO WE HAVE A NUMBER. WE ASSIGN A NUMBER TO THAT THE WHAT THE COSTS WILL BE. NO. SOMEBODY CAN'T BUT THAT WOULD NOT BE ME. MIGHT JUST OUT THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR TWELVE MONTHS WHAT WE'RE DOING IS TELLING THEM THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO IN SIX MONTHS RE APPLY AND REQUALIFICATION. SO ASSUMING THAT THEIR INCOME IS YOU KNOW IS STABLE THEY MAY OR MAY NOT QUALIFY ANYWAY FOR THE YEAR. SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY ALSO DOES THAT CALCULUS AND SAYS WHY DON'T WANT TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE I LOSE THIS BENEFIT. OTHER QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE. IT'S GONNA TAKE WHICH LIKE THE CLOSENESS WAS FRIEDMAN I'M AND DECIDE ASPIRIN I BOWED RESPECTFULLY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IT DOESN'T AND CHOI DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER AGUILAR CURRY A SECOND BY THE MISS BURKE. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL. WOOD YES WOULD AYE MAYES. THERE'S NOT VOTING HACKER CURRY. I CARE CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BIGELOW NO.

MISS AGUILAR CURRY WHICH YOU LIKE TO PRESENT. Q.. TO SUBMIT SOME SOME. FIVE I SEVEN SIX. THIS ME. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AMBER'S. AS YOU KNOW WELL THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHILE FAR SEASON WAS ONE OF THE WORST IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. NEARLY TWO DOZEN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS WERE IMPACTED BY THE FIRES PUTTING THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS CARE IN JEOPARDY. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX TAKES THE RECENT EXPERIENCES OF CLINICS AND HEALTH PROVIDERS INTO ACCOUNT. THE PROPOSES CHANGES THAT WILL PROVIDE IMPROVE CONTINUITY OF CARE IN THE FACE OF NATURAL DISASTERS. THIS BILL WILL CLARIFY THAT DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY PROVIDERS CAN HAVE TELEPHONE APPOINTMENTS. WITH PATIENTS PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN SHELTERS AND MAKE HOME VISITS WHERE NEEDED. THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE. AND BE REIMBURSED FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. IT'S CRITICAL TO KEEP PATIENTS HEALTHY AND AVOID UNNECESSARY STRAIN ON EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. FURTHER THIS BILL ALSO SETS OUT IN XCELERATED PERMITTING PROCESS FOR TEMPORARY PHARMACY LICENSES. THIS IS THE SENSUAL WHEN I HEALTH CENTER HAS BEEN DESTROYED OR CANNOT OPERATE THE PHARMACY TO DISPENSE MEDICATION TO PATIENTS. I HAVE I BELIEVE TWO WITNESSES HERE THAT ARE COMING UP. LORI LYNN HOGAN FROM SANTA ROSA COMMUNITY HEALTH AND MEGAN STUDENTS APPLYING FOR. YOUR BETH WELL LIT THAT MULLIN SKI ó CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS IF ADVOCATES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY.

TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE IT PLAYS IN SUPPORTING ACCESS TO CARE FOR DISASTER IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. OUR WHOLE CENTER IS A PROUD MEMBER OF BOTH THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION. AND THE REDWOOD COMMUNITY HEALTH COALITION THE CO SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX. TODAY I'LL START BY SHARING MY HELL CENTERS EXPERIENCE TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRESTORM AND THEN PROVIDE SOME STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE. ON THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL POLICY AND REGULATION TO SUPPORT HEALTH CARE WHEN DISASTER STRIKES. ON OCTOBER NINTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN. CENTER IS A COMMUNITY HEALTH LARGEST HEALTH CENTER ARE VISTA CAMPUS. WAS DESTROYED DUE TO THE EXPENSE EXTENSIVE FIRE SMOKE HEAT AND WATER DAMAGE IN THE FIRE STORM THAT HIT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN A FEW SHORT HOURS TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND OF OUR PATIENTS LOST THEIR MEDICAL HOME WHERE THEY RECEIVED COMPREHENSIVE PRIMARY CARE. AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WITHOUT THE PROBABILITY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OUR ORGANIZATIONS SUSTAINABILITY ENTER COMMUNITIES HEALTH AND WELL BEING. WAS AND STILL IS AT RISK. WHILE THE FIRES ARE STILL RAGING WHILE OUR PHONE LINES WERE DOWN IN OUR IT SERVICE WERE DESTROYED. WHILE WE WERE STILL TRIAGE IN OUR DAMAGES AND MANAGING TEMPORARY CLOSURES AT VARIOUS OTHER CAMPUSES. YOU TO SMOKE IN CHANGING FIRES OF PATTERNS. WE NEVER STOPPED PROVIDING HEALTH CARE PATIENTS NEEDED. THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND OUR WEBSITE WE PROVIDED REGULAR UPDATES TREPIDATIONS AND OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ON WHERE THEY CAN GO TO GET CARE. WE SENT OUR CLINICIANS RESIDENTS AND HEALTH CARE TEAMS TO SHELTERS. WE RAPIDLY CREATED ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO CONNECT WITH OUR PATIENTS THAT HAD BEEN EVACUATED ARE DISPLACED. WERE SHELTERING IN PLACE OR WHOSE PRIMARY CARE PLEASE EGGMAN DESTROYED. ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE OF THESE WAS PROVIDING TELEPHONE VISITS. OFFERING MEDICAL CARE OVER THE PHONE AS ROAD CLOSURES AIR QUALITY AN INOPERABLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MADE IN PERSON VISITS BOTH IMPOSSIBLE. AND UNSAFE. OUR PRIORITIES REMAIN TO BE SEE ALL OF OUR PATIENTS WHO NEED CARE. PROVIDE MEANINGFUL WORK FOR EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLY SPACE FOR A NURSE PRACTITIONER AND FAMILY PRACTICE RESIDENTS TO CONTINUE THEIR TRAINING. THIS IS WHY WE NEED AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX. OVER A THREE MONTH PERIOD ONLY TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWO DOZEN HEALTH CENTER CORPORATION SERVING A TEN COUNTY REGION. AND ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS WERE IMPACTED BY FIRES IN CALIFORNIA. THIS COMPREHENSIVE BILL AIMS TO PROVIDE THE STATE WITH ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING CHALLENGES DURING A DECLARED EMERGENCY. TELEPHONE VISITS. CAROUSEL TEARS. CARE AT HOME. THIS BILL WILL QUIRK CLARIFY STATE LAW TO ENSURE THAT. IN THESE THREE AREAS. A PROVIDERS CAN CONDUCT AND BE PAID FOR THESE KINDS OF VISITS IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. I LIKE TO THINK LONG AND FOR THIS IMPORTANT HEARING SUPPORT A BILL TODAY. ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HOPELESS ADVOCATES AND THE COMPLEX HEALTH CENTERS REPS AND ACROSS THE STATE. IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR US TO REALLY LEARN AND. MAKE SURE THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF LAST YEAR AREN'T REPEATED ACROSS OUR STATE WHEN FUTURE DISASTERS STRIKE POPULAR ENTRY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TODAY.

LIFE AGAR CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BIGELOW AYE BONTA. BURKE. BIRD I CARILLO. CARILLO AYE FLORA. FLORA AYE AMONG. MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE THIS AREA. SYRIAN AYE RODRIGUEZ. SANTIAGO. THURMOND WALDRON. MODERNIZE. TWO ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT WHICH LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR SECOND GO YEAH I WOULD THINK VERY MATHIS THREE MUCH. I DID NUMBER FOURTEEN AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTY FOUR MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS FOR WORKING WITH ME AND MY STAFF ON THIS BILL. I WILL BE TAKING THE AMENDED AMENDMENTS INDICATED THE ANALYSIS TO CLARIFY APPLICATION OF THE POLICY AND ADDRESS CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION. MEMBERS AS WE STRUGGLED WITH HOW TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE QUALITY HEALTH CARE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. REMUS LOOKED FIRST TO ADDRESS THE COST DRIVERS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE DIRECTLY TO HEALTH SERVICES OR PATIENT CARE. AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTY FORWARD WILL REQUIRE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE INVESTIGATE PROVIDER COMPLAINTS. THAT A HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLAN HAS UNDERPAID OR FAIL TO PAY THEM FOR THEIR SERVICES. IF D. M. AGE SEE DETERMINES AFTER INVESTIGATING CLAIMS THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLAN HAS ENGAGED IN A PATTERN. UNDERPAYING A PROVIDER THIS BILL REQUIRED THAT THE DIRECTOR ASSESSED ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF THE UNDER PAYMENT PLUS INTEREST. AND TO REIMBURSE THE PROVIDER FOR THE LOSSES INCURRED PLUS INTEREST. THIS CHANGE WILL ESTABLISH A PENALTY AMOUNT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO DISCOURAGE FUTURE VIOLATIONS AND CHANGE UNFAIR BUSINESS BEHAVIOR. THESE ARE COSTS THAT IN SEVERAL INEVITABLY END UP BEING PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMERS. REDUCING VIOLATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE WILL PROTECT THE ALLOWING PROVIDERS AND THE STATE TO INVEST THE ALREADY LIMITED RESOURCES INPATIENT CARE. RATHER THAN PAPERWORK. AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTY FOUR IT DOES NOT CHANGE EXISTING DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS. AND WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE DIEM AGENCIES DISCRETION TO DETERMINE WHEN A HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLAN HAS ENGAGED IN A PATTERN OF VIOLATING THE LAW. RATHER THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN THIS BILL WILL ONLY BE IMPOSED ON A HEALTH PLAN THAT IS FOUND TO BE HABITUALLY VIOLATING THE LAW. I ASK FOR AYE VOTE AND I HAVE ONE THOMAS FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WITH ME HERE TODAY. AS WELL AS DOCTOR WILLIAM ABRAM. WILLIAM AVERY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN ARE AGGRO OCCURRED. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WANT THOMAS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I TOO WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND MY GRATITUDE TO THE STAFF AND THE WORK THEY DID ON THE BILL. THINK AMENDMENTS MAKE IT A BETTER PRODUCT. THE SOMEONE DID A GREAT JOB OF DESCRIBING THE BILL SO I'M JUST GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE LEARNED. WHEN WE TALK TO OUR MEMBERS SO YOU KNOW DESPITE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE'S ENACTMENT OF AB FOURTEEN FIFTY FIVE OR LIKE EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO. THESE WIDESPREAD. OPINION ABUSE PRACTICES BY HEALTH PLANS. ARE CONTINUING THEIR CONTINUING TO FLOUT THE LAW. IN MARCH A CMA ALONG WITH THAT'S COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETIES AND SEVERAL SPECIALTY SOCIETIES. CONDUCT A SURVEY OF PHYSICIANS TO OBTAIN SOME FEEDBACK ON HEALTH PLANS ARE ROUTINELY ENGAGING IN UNFAIR PATTERNS. IN A PERIOD OF ABOUT NINE DAYS WE GOT SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY ONE. OF RESPONSES FROM PHYSICIAN PRACTICES REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF PHYSICIANS ACROSS THE STATE WE HAD RESPONSES FROM FORTY COUNTIES. TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS WERE FROM RURAL COUNTIES. SEVENTY FOUR PER PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS WERE AND PRACTICES OF FIVE OR LESS SO CLEARLY THIS IS BEHAVIOR THAT IS IMPACTING. SMALL PRACTICES PRACTICES THAT ARE RULE AREAS THAT ARE CUTTING. INTO. THEIR ABILITY TO. PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE AND KEEP THEIR THEIR DOORS OPEN. SO YOU KNOW. AT TWO ADDRESSES WERE SPONSORING. AB TWENTY SIX SEVEN FOUR THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN I THINK SHE DID A GREAT JOB DESCRIBING WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CHAINS OF THE EXISTING. PROCESS WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SAY THAT IN. WHEN THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION AND DETERMINATION THAT THERE'S BEEN A PATTERN OF UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR THAT THE PENALTIES NEED TO BE SUCH THAT IT MITIGATES THIS BEHAVIOR GOING FORWARD. SO. THANK YOU AND NOW WE ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. DOCTOR EVER THANK YOU AND I'M A. DUCKBILL A ROMA CARDIOLOGISTS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE ALIGNED WITH A LARGE MEDICAL CENTER AND OTHER. CARDIOLOGISTS AND. AND DE STE SO THAT THERE'S A PROCESS. I IT'S TAKES PLACE CALLED PRE AUTHORIZATION. AND WE COMPLY WITH IT. I IT'S TIME CONSUMING. IN A WAY WHERE I CAN I HAVE STAFF MEMBERS EXPLAIN THIS SITUATION AND THE PATIENT'S DIAGNOSIS WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR WHAT WE NEED TO DO. THEY BUMP IT UP TO MAYES SO I CAN TALK TO A CLERK TYPICALLY AND THEN AFTER I TALKED TO THE CLERK ASKED TALK TO MEDICAL DIRECTOR. AND. THEN WE GET THAT APPROVED. AND AND I HAVE THE PATIENT IN HIS SEVENTIES WHO I DEVELOPED A SEVERELY NEAR AN. AREA ORDERED VALVE WHICH POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING. FIFTY PERCENT MORTALITY WITH THE ONSET OF SYMPTOMS OF HEART FAILURE WHICH HE HAS. GOT APPROVED. AND THEN WE DID THE PROCEDURE AND THEN AFTERWARDS DE. DESPITE HAVING EXPLAINED IT BEFORE AND GOT THE PRE AUTHORIZATION THEY SAID. WE WANT TO SEE ALL THE RECORDS. SO WE SENT THE RECORDS I SAID I'M. THROUGH A FAX I SENT HIM THROUGH MY ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. I IMAGE COMMITTEE THAT DOES IT. AND DIDN'T GET A RESPONSE AND WHAT HAPPENS IF TIME PASSES THEY USE THE TIME AS A REASON. TO NOT PAY. SO THIS IS A GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE INTERVENING TIME. HAD A RUPTURED HIS AORTIC ANEURYSM AND. THE MANAGEMENT THAT IS. IT DELAYED BY THE FACT THAT HE STILL HAS SEVERE AORTIC STENOSIS WHEN HE COULD HAVE HAD A TRANS CATHARINE ORDERED VALVE REPLACEMENT WHICH IS. YOU KNOW REDUCE THE MAJORITY ITALIAN CITIZEN EXAMPLE. AND IT'S ONE THAT'S CLEAR MY MIND BECAUSE IT'S RECENT BUT IT'S A IT'S A HABITUAL PATTERN. AND I THINK THE SURVEY SHOWS THAT IT'S NOT JUST MY EXPERIENCE BUT HUNDREDS OF PHYSICIANS AND AND FRANKLY PHYSICIANS DON'T TAKE THEIR TIME TO DO THIS KIND REPORT AND WE'RE SEEING PATIENTS OFF THEIR SEVEN HUNDRED THAT ANSWER THAT THERE'S PROBABLY SEVEN THOUSAND DIDN'T. AND SO WHAT THE LAWS ARE THERE IS YOU'RE SAYING AND. MAYBE THEY JUST NEED SOME BETTER TEETH. ANY QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER WITH MY EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. KRISTIN HER LOCKED IN CALIFORNIA RHEUMATOLOGY LINES IN SUPPORT. KIM. HOW SOUTHERN OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATIONS? IF YOU. TOM REILLY ON BEHALF OF CALDERON IN SUPPORT. YOU VERY MUCH. HE WON OPPOSITION. WELL I'M SORRY IT DO YOU YOU'RE READING I. THANK CALIFORNIA CALUMET FAMILY PHYSICIANS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NICK LOUISE OWES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS ON IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX. SEVENTY FOUR. EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS ON THAT ARE BEING ADOPTED TODAY. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL IN IN THE SUIT. IS MY FIRST DAY OF TESTIMONY OF THE YEAR SO. OKAY. YEAH EXACTLY EXECUTIVE I HAVE ONE THANK YOU THOUGH. AB TWENTY SIX EMMY FOR A WERE OPPOSED WE BELIEVE IT WILL INCREASE HEALTH PLAN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. BY ALLOWING PROVIDERSTO INITIATE REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST OUR MEMBER HEALTH PLANS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL PAYMENT DISPUTE NO MATTER HOW BIG OR HOW SMALL. AND AYE WE WANT TO THINK THE OFFICE STAFF FOR BRINGING US IN EARLY AND GIVING US A HEADS UP ABOUT THE BILL. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE POLICY IN ABOUT WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY DOES. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL PLACES A HUGE BURDEN ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE TO ADJUDICATE WHAT WILL BE. A LARGE NUMBER OF NEW CLAIMS THAT LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS IS MANDATORY FINES ARE LEVIED AGAINST ARE MET MEMBER HEALTH PLANS. INEFFECTIVE THIS BILL IS AN ACTIVE THE REGULATOR WILL BE ADJUDICATING ISSUING FINES ON EVERY DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN CONTRACTED PARTIES. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKING. I TAKE THIS TO A PATTERN OR PRACTICE MODEL. IT WE WE BELIEVE IT STILL APPLIES ON ON AN INDIVIDUAL CASE BY CASE BASIS. SO IMPLEMENTING THIS BILL. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS NOT A GOOD EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES AND WILL DISTRACT THE REGULATOR FROM ITS FOCUS ON OTHER CONSUMER ORIENTED ISSUES. EXISTING LAW WAS HEAVILY NEGOTIATED. AND. WAS NEGOTIATED TO AVOID UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS OF THE STATE IS GOING TO ACT AS YOU ULTIMATE JUDGE AND EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT DISPUTE. AND THE ANALYSIS. THAT WAS PREPARED BY STAFF. GOES OVER THE EXISTING BODY OF LAW AND IN GOOD DETAIL. UNDER CURRENT LAW JUST AS A SUMMARY THE DO YOU MAY SEE IS ALREADY AUTHORIZED TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS AND ASSESS MONETARY PENALTIES ON HEALTH PLANS FOR UNFAIR PAYMENTS. AFTERNOON AFTER A PATTERN OF PRACTICE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS ON IF THE TEAM AC DOES MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT A PLAN DID NOT PAY A FAIR AMOUNT OF THE PROVIDER. THE PLAN WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNPAID AMOUNT IN THE CALCULATED INTEREST ON THE UNPAID AMOUNT. WHICH WOULD BE RETROACTIVE BACK TO THE ORIGINAL DATE. THAT THE PLAN RECEIVE THE CLAIM. WHAT AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTY FOUR IS ASKING FOR IS AN ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY ON TOP OF THAT FOR INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS? IF THE DEPARTMENT DOT CURRENTLY IF THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES A NUMBER OF REPORTS RELATED TO PROVIDER DISPUTES THAT YOU MAY SEE CAN DECIDE TO DO A NON ROUTINE SERVING ON THE PLANS. AND YOU AN UNFAIR PAYMENT PATTERN EMERGING TREND ANALYSIS. THAT'S EXISTING LAW. AND PROCESS. AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTY FOUR WOULD INSTEAD REMOVE THE DEBATE SEIZE DISCRETION IN THESE AREAS AND AND REQUIRE INVESTIGATION SOME PENALTIES IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL PAYMENT DISPUTE. AND AGAIN IF THEY'RE ALREADY CLEARLY ESTABLISHED RULES FOR HOW THESE A COMPLAINT SHOULD BE HANDLED. IN ADDITION TO EXISTING LAW THE CONTRACT TERMS BETWEEN PLANS I'M PROVIDERS UNUSUALLY OUTLINED A PROCESS FOR RESOLVING THIS DISPUTES. YOU KNOW BUT BASED ON THE OF SPONSORS SURVEY IT APPEARS AT A NUMBER OF. A LARGE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS ARE UNAWARE OF THE CURRENT YOU MAY SEE PROCESS AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT. PERHAPS. IT BETTER EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO THEIR MEMBERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE INSTEAD OF. THE MOVIE FOR WITH THIS BILL. SO WE ASK FOR NO VOTE. BUT OTHERS IN OPPOSITION YEAH I JUGGLING ARAB F. ANTHEM BLUE CROSS. ANYONE ELSE. GREENBACKS COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. TO ME. I'M NEW. TOM SO I GET TO TO PLAY DUMB LITTLE BETTER BUT. FROM THE OPPOSITION ARE ARE ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. WE HAVEN'T BEEN. THE ONLY THING THAT WE'VE BEEN PRESENTED IS WITH THE. ASSOCIATION SURVEY BY THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WHICH. BUT YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE DON'T FIND ANY OTHER SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR STUDIES A REPORTS THAT SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE. ARE WE HAVEN'T BEEN PRESENTED WITH ONE THAT WE CAN REACT TO AT LEAST. AND IT I MEAN IF WE CAN GO BACK TO THEIR SURVEY ACTUALLY. JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS. IN WHEN THEY DID SURVEY THEIR MEMBERS I MEAN WE DO HAVE TO KNOW THAT APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY ONE PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS STATED. THAT THEIR APPEALS ROOF WERE EITHER RESOLVED ALWAYS MOST OFTEN OR AT LEAST HALF THE TIME WHEN THEY JUST WENT THROUGH THE HEALTH PLAN'S INTERNAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS. SO THAT PROCESS WHICH IS EXISTING LAW. YOU KNOW ACHIEVES RESULTS. YOU KNOW THAT AGAIN I HAVE TO SAY. THEIR SURVEY ALSO SHOWS A PROVIDERS ALL OVERWHELMINGLY FEEL TO USE THE DAMAGE HE'S PROVIDER COMPLAINTS SYSTEM. AND WHEN THEY WERE ASKED WHY THEY DID USE IT A MAJORITY OF THEM SO THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT SO. PERHAPS THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM IS. WELL IF I COULD GO AHEAD ANSWER. YEAH WELL I THINK THE. THE WAY WE INTERPRET THAT IS THAT DO ITS HAS LOW USAGE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S PERMISSIVE THE DM DM EIGHT SEE PROCESSES PERMISSIVE. ARE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE. PROVIDER COMPLAINTS. THEY DO IT. LIKE WHEN AN ASSOCIATION LIKE OURS IN OUR MEMBERS. UP ALERT US AND WE GATHER THE INFORMATION AND TAKE IT TO DAMAGE CMA AND THEY DO AN INVESTIGATION. I THINK. CLEARLY THAT. WHAT THE LAST DOCTOR ABLE SAID DOCTORS ARE BUSY SEEING PATIENTS THE FACT THAT WE GOT SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY ONE RESPONSES AND SUCH AMOUNT OF TIME SHOWS THERE'S A LOT OF INTENSITY AROUND THIS? THAT THE PROBLEM CONTINUES EVEN AFTER. THE LAWS THAT WERE PASSED EIGHT EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO AND SO WHAT WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO DO IS TO. PUT ENOUGH TEETH INTO THE LAW SO THAT HEALTH PLANS AREN'T ESSENTIALLY MAKING A BUSINESS DECISION WHERE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS THEY CONTINUE WITH THIS UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR. OF UNDERPAYING DENYING CLAIMS. TO PROVIDERS. AND THEN GETTING WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY AFTER THEY'VE MADE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. RETAINING THIS MONEY OR KEEPING THE MONEY OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE PROVIDERS THAT THEY'RE OWED AND GETTING WHAT'S RELATIVELY A SMALL. FINE FOR THAT SO IT SIMPLY BECOMES A BUSINESS DECISION FOR THEM TO TAKE THE FINE AND AND MAKE THE MONEY SO WHAT ALL WE'RE SAYING IS IS TO ROUTE TO HELP MITIGATE THIS BEHAVIOR. BY. GIVING ARE PROVIDING THAT DEPARTMENTS HEALTH CARE WITH THE AUTHORITY TO LEVY A MORE SEVERE FINES. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ADDRESS RIGHT QUICKLY IS THE IDEA OF THIS. WHETHER THEY INVESTIGATE INDIVIDUAL OR PATTERNS CURRENTLY DIEM MAKE SEE SAYS THAT ONCE YOU GO THROUGH THE PLAN'S INTERNAL PROCESS. AND NOTHING IS RESOLVED AND YOU CAN USE A DUE TO MAKE SEE PROC PROCESS AND YOU CAN'T SUBMIT INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO MOVING FORWARD IF THE IF IF THE LANGUAGE ISN'T TIGHT ENOUGH IS WE WANT THE ENHANCED PENALTIES TO APPLY ONLY? TO PATTERNS OF UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF A SMALL CLINIC IN A RULE COUNTY OR IN AN URBAN COUNTY HAS. A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR DISPUTE WITH THE PLAN THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUBMIT THAT ONE CLAIM TO BE MADE CNC IF THEY CAN GET SOME RESOLUTION. SO. WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO SEE THE ENHANCED PENALTIES APPLY TO THOSE HEALTH PLANS ARE BEHAVING UNLAWFULLY? AND A PATTERN OVER TIME. ANYONE ELSE. SO TERM SO I GUESS I'M GONNA A COUPLE A COUPLE QUESTIONS YOUR QUESTION. YEAH PLEASE GO AHEAD WELL FIRST OF ALL IS THERE SOMEONE FROM TEAMMATES SEE WHO CAN. COME UP AND TALK ABOUT THIS. OKAY SO. WHY CAN'T BE ADMINISTRATIVELY TO THIS? THEY DO HAVE CURRENTLY. HAVE WITH FORTY TO DO INVESTIGATIONS AND ASSESS PENALTIES. IT'S A BROAD AUTHORITY IT IS SO THEY CAN PRETTY MUCH DO WHATEVER THEY WANT THERE'S A. THERE'S NO SPECIFICS ON WHAT TYPES OF PENALTIES AND FINES AT LEAST FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW THAT THEY SHOULD APPLY. SO CURRENTLY THEY DO DO THESE AS I SAID IT'S PERMISSIVE. SO. THEY THAT WHICH MEANS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE POWER THE PEOPLE HOURS IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE AN ADEQUATE NUMBER OF THESE. PROVIDER COMPLAINTS IN THIS IS NOT VISIT JUST POSITIONS THAT'S PROVIDERS ACROSS THE BOARD. THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO AN ADEQUATE JOB OF MITIGATING BEHAVIOR. THAT IS HARMING OF. PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE. SO ARE THERE ANY EXAMPLES. VERY FEW. ARE THERE EXAMPLES OF CASES WHERE PAYMENT OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN MISSED THAT HAS BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO. THE PATIENT'S LIFE OR ME LIKE I SAW THE OTHER STATISTICS BUT. I JUST WANNA UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S BEEN SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT THAT'S HAPPENED THAT'S. FORCING YOU TO BRING THIS FORWARD NOW. I BROUGHT A FOUR BECAUSE ON THE SECOND ONE TO BE ABOVE THE FOLD. THERE WAS A SPECIFIC. OF PROVIDER THAT WAS ABROAD TO EVERYONE'S ATTENTION. AND IT AFFECTS MY DISTRICT AS WELL AS MANY RURAL DISTRICTS AS WELL. AND IF I COULD. YET WHEN WE DID THE SURVEY WE ALSO ASKED FOR EXAMPLES OF OF HOW. OF THIS BEHAVIOR BY THE PLANS IMPACTED. PATIENT CARE IN THEIR ABILITY TO DO THE PRACTICE I THINK DOCTOR ABLE PRESENTED ONE AND AN EXAMPLE MAYBE ONE HERE BUT DOCTOR EVIL CAN YOU. YEAH THERE'S A PROCESS SAID THAT WE COMPLY WITH THAT CALLED PRE AUTHORIZATION HEALTH PLAN CONSERVE TRACKS IT OUT TO THIRD PARTY WHICH IS STAFFED BY. RADIOLOGISTS WHO YOU KNOW ARE PRESUMABLY SEEING PATIENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE TO TAKE THE PHONE CALLS TYPICALLY. I HAVE A STAFFER DO THE INITIAL CALL AND THEY DO THE CALL WITH PERSON AND I ALSO HAVE COMPUTER SOFTWARE THAT MATCHES STUFF UP. SO. THE DATA IS THERE IS TO THE INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE. I AND DE THE SO THAT THEY DON'T THEY THE INDICATIONS. IN THE YOU KNOW PREPARE IN THESE CASES ARE PRETTY CLEAR THESE ARE. BORDERLINE THINGS EITHER THINGS THAT THEIR SOFTWARE SAYS IT'S OKAY TO DO. AND THEN AFTER THE FACT. SO I'VE USED THIS THIRD PARTY HAVE GOTTEN APPROVED BY AND. YOU KNOW IF I NEED TO I GO UP TO A LICENSED PHYSICIAN A RADIOLOGIST TYPICALLY. AND WHO SAN WHO'S HEARD IT AND SAYS IT'S NECESSARY. AND THEN. LATER AFTER THE. CLAIM IS BEEN POSTED. AND AND. INSTEAD OF PAYING THE CLAIM THAT THEY AGREED THAT THEY'RE GONNA DO BECAUSE THE PATIENT NEEDED IT FOR THE REASON THAT THEY HAD A LIFE THREATENING DIAGNOSIS. THEY SAY SEND US RECORDS. SO THEY DON'T SAY CENTERS ONE RECORD DON'T SAY SEND THE TEST THAT YOU DID THIS AND SEND ALL THE RECORDS. SO WE SEND ALL THE RECORDS. AND THEN WE DON'T GET A RESPONSE BACK ON THAT. AND THEN THERE'S A TALK TO A CLOCK TICKING IF YOU DON'T GET AND TIME IT'S DENIED BECAUSE OF TIME. AND I YOU KNOW I'VE GOT OTHER THINGS TO DO SO SOMETIMES I MISS THAT DEADLINE AND YOU KNOW I'D I DELEGATE AS MUCH OF THIS TO STAFF AS I CAN. BUT. IT REALLY SEEMS STRATEGIC CAM AND DE THERE APPARENTLY THIS ISN'T JUST MY EXPERIENCE OF BECAUSE THERE'S NOW A SURVEY. SHOWING HUNDREDS OF DOCTORS THAT WERE. BOTHERED ENOUGH BY THIS THAT THEY TOOK THE SURVEY. I'M ALSO ON THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY'S. WHICH IS WHY I'M UP HERE TODAY AND YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO GET DOCKS TO DO THIS IT'S HARD TO GET HIM TO TAKE TIME TO REPORT THEIR EXPENSES BECAUSE. WELL WE LIKE TO DO WAS TAKE CARE PATIENTS AND YOU KNOW DO THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRAINED TO DO IN THIS ISN'T IT IT REALLY IS. SO I'M I'M THE CURE IS THIS. THIS IS THE QUESTIONS YOU DOCTORS THIS IS THIS UP PATTERN THAT YOU SEE OF YOU YOU CITED AN EXAMPLE SO WAS THIS A PATTERN. IS A PATTERN WITH SPECIFIC PLANS. THROUGH GOAL IS OPEN TO YOU THE THE THOUGH YOU KNOW THAT THE. THE THE PLAN IS IN THE ROOM. ON THIS ONE SO THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN MAYBE ANSWER WHETHER THEY. PLANET THAT WAY I DO I DO THINK THEY ARE THERE IS SOME TARGETING THAT GOES ON WITH IT. SO THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT YOU YOU'LL DO PRE AUTHORIZATIONS AND THAT THIS IS A RECENT EXAMPLE BUT IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A LOAN EXAMPLE CORRECT. THE PRE AUTHORIZATION PROCESS I I UNDERSTAND AND I I PARTICIPATE AND YOU KNOW WHAT. IF IT WAS DONE IN GOOD FAITH YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S REASONABLE YEAH YOU DON'T WANT UNNECESSARY PROCEDURES BEING DONE YOU WANT YOU KNOW ONE MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT THINGS BEING DONE FOR THE RIGHT PATIENT. BUT AFTER THAT AFTER EVERYBODY AGREES YOU FELT TAKEN THE TIME TO AGREED THAT THIS IS NECESSARY TO THEN PULL THE RUG OUT AFTERWARDS IN AND THEN GO ON YOUR DEADLINES AND SAVE YOU DON'T GET THIS. PIECE PAPERBACK BY THIS TIME. WE GOT WE GOT YOU. AND THERE REALLY IS A GOTCHA KIND OF A PROCESS. AND I AM I THINK THINK YOU FOR THANK YOU TO YOU HAPPENING. THOUGHTS ON THAT MISTER I JUST YOU KNOW THIS BILL HAS TO DO WITH PAYMENT DISPUTES. BETWEEN HOW MUCH A DOCTOR GOT PAID THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO DO WITH PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. Y. THING NUMBER ONES YOU DID GET PAID. YEAH THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD IT'S GOOD HE'S TALKING ABOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR CARE THAT'S A COMPLETE THAT'S A. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A DIFFERENT SUBJECT TO ME. THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT A DISPUTE ABOUT THE AMOUNT THAT YOU GOT PAID. WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS BILL AND TO YOUR POINT MISTER CHAIR THE DNA THAT YOUMAY SEE CAN ALREADY LEVY PENALTIES ON PATTERNS OF PRACTICE. THROUGH THE CHAIR UMPIRE WHILE. THE BILL DOES DO YOU MAY SEE THE ALREADY HAS REGULATIONS ON BY A. LARGE NUMBER OF BEHAVIORS THAT THE PLANS WILL DO AND WHAT DOCTOR ABLE JUST DESCRIBED IS ONE OF THOSE BEHAVIORS. THAT NGUYEN DONE IN A PATTERN. IT WOULD COULD BE AFTER OF INVESTIGATION DETERMINED TO BE UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR OF A PATTERN OF UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR SO. THAT'S IN THE REGULATIONS AND WHAT DR ABEL'S TALK ABOUT IS ABSOLUTELY ONE ISSUES THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED BY THE SPELL. SO QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IS IS IT YOUR CONTENTION THAT EVERY CLAIM BE ADJUDICATED IN THIS WAY. BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE THAT IF THAT IS THE CASE THAT IS AN UNFAIR BURDEN ON DMA SEE IN THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE. WE'RE HOPING THAT THROUGH BY GETTING A SPELL THIS PASSES THAT WILL WORK DMA. H. C. ON THE MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO MAKE SURE THESE THINGS GET THROUGH. AND SO I WOULD WANT THEM TO GO THROUGH ABSOLUTELY. YES WHISPERED TO TEAR YEAH I AM AND I THINK. JUST TO. PUT A LITTLE MORE. VERBIAGE AROUND WHAT TO SOMEONE SAID I THINK ONCE AGAIN IT'S ALREADY PART OF THEIR. JIM MADE SEEDS. A REGULATIONS THAT INDIVIDUAL DISPUTES CAN BE SUBMITTED TO THEM FOR CONSIDERATION. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AN ACCOMPLICE IN THE BILL IS TO APPLY THE ENHANCED PENALTIES. TO THOSE PLANS THAT THAT THERE WOULD THERE'S A PATTERN OF. UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR SO I THINK MOVING FORWARD IF THE IF THE CURRENT LANGUAGE DOESN'T DO THAT AND WE'RE GONNA WE'RE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH. THE OPPONENT'S. DE MATE SEE AND ANYONE ELSE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN IN THE WAY TO ENSURE THAT. THE ENHANCED PENALTIES APPLY TO PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR. SO THEN I GUESS MY QUESTION TO MR LUISA'S SO DO YOU OBJECT TO ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR. IF THAT'S THAT AS I AS AS PRESENTED BY THIS. AT THIS POINT IN TIME WAS PRESENTED WITH OTHER EVIDENCE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR THIS BILL. SO I JUST LEAVE IT THAT WITHOUT CONFERRING WITH MY MEMBERS. ALRIGHT. THAT. WHICH I CLOSE. I'M SORRY IF YOU ARE IN THE QUESTION. I'M JUST ARE A QUESTION THERE WAS A PROPOSED AMENDMENT IT HASN'T BEEN TAKEN I DON'T BELIEVE AT THIS POINT SHE. DID ACCEPTED MINIMALISM'S. DIFFERENT AMENDMENT OKAY WAS AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS I PRESENTED TO YOU IN AND SUGGESTED. SO THAT WOULD TAKE AND I WOMEN EIGHT OUT IT WOULD JUST SAY. ELIMINATE BUT NOT LIMITED TO IN SUBSECTION BE. TWO OF THE PROPOSED SECTION H. AS SEE. THIRTEEN EIGHT SIX POINT FIVE. I KNOW IT'S A LONG AND IT AND THAT'S IN THE WEEDS. I BELIEVE. THAT KIND OF ADDRESSES THEIR ISSUE. AND THE CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING RAISED HERE. WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING YOU'D BE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. OKAY. YES I I'M WILLING TO TAKE THAT. THAT MAY NOT RESOLVE ALL YOUR ISSUES BUT I THINK THAT GETS. A STRONG PERCENTAGE OF YOUR ISSUE RESOLVED I KNOW YOU PARTICULAR SECTION BUT I BELIEVE AS I UNDERSTAND IT. THAT WOULD THAT WOULD TAKE THAT% OLD OPEN ENDED COMPONENT THAT EACH OF THE MEMBERS HERE. DRESSED VERY IF IF IF I MAY I MEAN WE WOULD HAVE TO REVIEW THAT BUT I THINK STRUCTURALLY THE BILL. JUST JUST THE WAY IT'S CONSTRUCTED. RELATES TO INDIVIDUAL DISPUTES JUST BY JUST BY JUST BITES CONSTRUCTION BUT WHAT WERE HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD BUT. BUT. TO GIVE OPPOSED IF IF I HAD A NOD OF AGREEMENT YOU BE WILLING TO TAKE THAT I'D BE WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY. THAT WAS A NOT WELL YEAH. THAT WOULD BE A YES. OKAY. THEN I WILL COMMIT TO SEE. SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY WITHOUT AMENDMENT. MISTER MISTER CHAIR IN LIGHT OF OTHER AUTHOR WHEN TO WORK TO CONTINUE WORK THE STAKEHOLDERS SOME OF THE BILL. SECOND.

WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AT THIS BILL DOES MOVE FOR TODAY I THINK WE ARE A LITTLE CONCERNED. ABOUT THAT CODIFYING EXISTING PRACTICE I'M IN STATUTE THAT WHEN THESE ARE VERY FLUID DYNAMIC SITUATIONS SOMETIMES IT'S A SIMPLE EMAIL FROM THE DEPARTMENT ASKING THE PLANS TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING INTERFACE WITH THEIR ENROLLEES IN INSURANCE. SO WHAT WERE A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT IS A BUILDING A LITTLE BIT OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT HOW IT SAYS THAT TO HAPPEN I THINK OUR PLANS WOULD PREFER AT PROCESS FOR WHICH THE DEPARTMENT. NOTIFY THAN THAT THEY THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE IN THAT THEY WOULD LIKE THEM TO INTERFACE WITH THAT VERSUS HAVING THE PLANS DECIDE WHEN AND WHERE THEY SHOULD BE FILING SOMETHING THAT CERTAIN DISASTERS. WE'VE SEEN NATURAL DISASTERS I'M THAT ARE DECLARE THAT DON'T NECESSARILY IMPACT AND RELEASE YOUR INSURANCE AND SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING TO BE.

IT'S TRUE DONALD HAS TWO BILLS FIRST BILL IS DEEPLY TWENTY NINES THE ONE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO RESENT AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY ONE WHICH REQUIRES LOCAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCIES. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS LANCE SAYS TO TRANSMIT AMBULANCE PATIENT OFF LOAD TIME DATA TO THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. WHEN EMS PERSONNEL BRING A PATIENT TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM THEY'RE REQUIRED BY LAW TO WAIT WITH THEIR PATIENT UNTIL THAT PATIENT CAN BE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL. FIRE DEPARTMENT'S AMBULANCE DRIVERS AM LUMPS US ACROSS THE STATE. CONSISTENTLY REPORT UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS SOMETIMES FOR HOURS MANY TIMES ARE. WE WAITING FOR HOURS. IN THE OFF LOADING TRANSFER PATIENTS. AND LOOK TO THE LOCAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. THESE DELAYS ARE KNOWN AS WALL TIME THEIR FIREFIGHTERS PARAMEDICS EMTS LEANING AGAINST THE WALL THEY'RE JUST STANDING THERE WAITING FOR THEIR PATIENT TO BE ACCEPTED TO THE HOSPITAL. AND THERE'S A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT THAT MAY OCCUR. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I AUTHORED AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THIS HIGHLY COMPLEX ISSUE. AND I WANT TO STRESS IT IS A COMPLEX ISSUE. THAT BILL DIRECTOR THE M. S. AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP A STANDARD METHOD. FOR MEASURING AND REPORTING AMBULANCE PATIENT OFF LOAD TIMES. THIS THE BILL ALSO AUTHORIZED THE DEBT DID NOT REQUIRE LAPSES TO ADOPT POLICIES FOR REPORTING WALL TIME TO THE AUTHORITY. WHILE THE AUTHORITY TO FILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITY UNDER AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE REPORTED THE REPORTING OF ALL TIME DATA BY LEMP SAYS. HAS BEEN INTERMITTENT AT BEST. IN FACT MORE THAN HALF OF THE THIRTY THREE LANCE'S ACROSS THE STATE HAVE NOT REPORTED ANY DATA AT ALL. THE ABSENCE OF CONSISTENT STATEWIDE INFORMATION CREATES US CREATE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR STAKEHOLDERS WORKING TO DEVELOP POLICIES THAT CAN REDUCE. OR ELIMINATE OFFLOAD DELAY. AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY NINE SIXTY ONE SIMPLY SEEKS TO OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION VERY REQUIRING RATHER THAN PERMITTING LAMB SAYS TERABYTE AMBULANCE PATIENT OFFLOAD TIME DATA. TO THE AUTHORITY ON A CONSISTENT BASIS WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT ITS CHRISTY BONE WITH A CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. THE BILL. BUT CHRISSY MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KRISTIE BELL ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS PLEASED TO BE SPONSORS THIS MEASURE. CONSIDERING THE MOTION THE SECOND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT NOT ONLY ARE FIREFIGHTERS ON THE WALL THERE ALSO RENDERING CARE THEY'RE LIKE AN EXTENSION OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UNTIL THEY CAN TRANSFER PATIENT CARE TO THE HOSPITAL. OF THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS DELAY PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR AND EVEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR RESOURCE. IMPLICATION FALLS BACK ON COUNTIES OF WHO ARE CONTRACTING WITH THEM TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE SO. I WILL CLOSE BY SAYING WE APPRECIATE THE RESEARCH PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND THEIR INTEREST IN SOLVING THIS PROBLEM WITH US. AND THAT IS OUR INTEREST TO LET'S GET A COMPLETE SET OF DATA AND THEN TALK ABOUT WHETHER THESE PROBLEMS ARE A RESTRICTED TO CERTAIN AREAS. BASED ON THE DESIGN OF THE IN THE SYSTEM IN THAT AREA OR STATEWIDE. A LET'S SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN A SMART WAY WE ARE TO SUPPORT. VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. NO ONE. SIR OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COUNTY DELGADO WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTEREST IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE ARE HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS. COLLABORATIVELY TO TRY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AND TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE. ISSUES THAT. DRIVE THIS A. THEY PATIENT OFFLOAD TIME. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE FACT THAT THIS PROCESS OF COLLECTION IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THAT THE INFORMATION. IS GOING TO BE. IS COLLECTED THROUGH THE LAMB SAYS AND AND PROVIDED TO THE ABSENCE WILL BE IN A WAY THAT THE DATA WILL BE USEFUL. BECAUSE WE THINK THAT EACH ONE OF THOSE. M. SAYS MAYBE REPORTING IN DIFFERENT FORMATS. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THESE ARE HUMAN CONDITIONS. AND EACH CASE IS VERY DIFFERENT SO TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT THOSE INDIVIDUAL DRIVERS ARE MAY BE DIFFICULT TO. TO GET TO THROUGH JUST STRICT DATA THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT ALL HOSPITALS REPORT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE EIGHT PATIENT DELAY SO YOU MIGHT BE COMPARING HOSPITALS THAT DO HAVE A LARGE VOLUME TO A HOSPITAL THAT DOES NOT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE IN OPPOSITION. SIR ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT ALSO AND OTHERS OTHERS QUESTIONS ANYONE ELSE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE DANCE. YEAH MISTER MISTER RODRIGUEZ. YES FIRST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING THIS BILL FOREGROUNDS. I CAN ATTEST MANY TIMES OF I'VE WAITED. A WALL ON THE WALL I'M UP TO EIGHT HOURS AND THE SHIFT THAT ARE TWENTY FOUR HOUR SHIFTS WE WORK. AND FOR NUMBER REASONS ARE YOU SPECIFIC SANTA. SUMMER O'DONNELL THAT. MEMPHIS LEADER DIFFERENT ON WHY THE WALL TIMES GREATER THAN OTHERS. AND ACCURACY SURE YOU THAT EVEN FROM THE SMALL COMMUNITY HOSPITALS TO THE LARGE MEDICAL CENTERS I HAVE WAITED HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS. WITH THAT SAID LOOK WHERE DOES TO PATIENT CARE YOU KNOW IT. SOMEBODY CALLED NINE ONE ONE. SEEK EIGHT WE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL AND GUESS WHAT. DEPENDING ON WHAT HOT SPRING GO TO WHAT THE SERBS CIRCUMSTANCES ARE YOUR ARE SITTING BASICALLY SITTING WITH THEIR PATIENTS ON THE GURNEY. FOR HOURS AT A TIME IN THE HALLWAY. WHAT DOES THAT DO TO PATIENT CARE FOR ONE? THE MOST PART WHAT IT DOES TO A FIRST RESPONDERS THAT SHOULD BE OUT THERE ON THE STREETS AND STATIONS. READY TO GO OVER THE NEXT EMERGENCY IN AND AND IN SOME CASES IT DELAY SERVICE. TO THEM I WANT SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU HAVE. OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SITTING NEXT TO A PATIENT. AND OFFICE YOU DO RENDERING AID IN CARE BECAUSE. ALWAYS THERE FOR HOURS YOU'RE STILL MUTTERING THE VITAL SIGNS ARE STRONG MAKING SURE THE PATIENT IS OKAY UNTIL THERE'S A BIT OF ALCOHOL. SO IT'S IT'S A BIG ISSUE AND IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS IN MY OVER THIRTY YEARS WORK NOW MEANS INDUSTRY. I WOULD SAY HALF OF THAT TIME HAS BEEN SPENT. ON WALL TIME. SO I THOUGHT I JUST WANT THAT YOU BRING THIS BILL FORWARD I CAN ATTEST TO YOU ON. THE SOONER THE BETTER TARGET DRESSES ISSUES AND GOT OUR FOLKS OUT THERE BACK ON THE STREET WHILE MOST IMPORTANT GETTING THOSE PATIENTS THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. AND WHAT THAT SELECT BR AUDIT ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR IS WHAT THAT'S POSSIBLE SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGS BEFORE. I'M SO I GUESS MY QUESTION MY QUESTION IS. SO THIS IS REQUIRING THE COLLECTION OF DATA SO. WHY ARE YOU OPPOSED TO THE COLLECTION OF DATA? WE BELIEVE THAT A. THAT THE COMPARISON WILL BE DIFFICULT TO MAKE IF SOME HOSPITALS. REPORT NOTHING AND OTHER HOSPITALS DO WE JUST AND ALSO THAT THE WAVE THAT EACH HOSPITAL REPORTS. TO BE INDIVIDUAL LAMB SAYS MAYBE USING A DIFFERENT MECHANISM WHETHER IT'S AN ELECTRONIC VERSION OR A FORM VERSION SO WE WE FEEL THAT MAYBE IT HAD DIFFICULT WAY TO MAKE COMPARISON WE AS. AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE AUTHOR AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT OUR HOSPITAL MEMBERS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON. THE SHIP COMMENT. CARE. TRY MY MIKE MISTER CHAIRMAN I I BELIEVE UNDER THE BILL THOUGH PROVIDERS DO THE REPORTING AND IT'S BASED ON WHETHER IT'S AN ELECTRONIC PATIENT CARE RECORD THE ROOK REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN. OR SOME OTHER METHODOLOGY AS DETERMINED BY THE LOCALLY AMISS AGENCY AT THE CORE. OPEN TO. THE FORMAT TO WHICH THAT TAKES THAT IT'S HELPFUL DATA BUT THIS IS ALREADY BEING COLLECTED WHAT CHRONICALLY. AND I WOULD EVEN SUGGEST THAT WE LOVE TO GIVE US THE HOSPITAL GOLD STAR IF THEY. ARE REPORTED TO HAVE NO WHILE TIME. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR. THROUGH BIGELOW. NOT THANK YOU I'M. I GUESS MY I'M JUST GONNA. KIND OF LOOK AT IT. LIKE THE GOOD MEMBER DOWN HERE SPEAKING BOTH OF US HAPPEN TO BE ENTITIES WITH WORK ON AMBULANCES AND SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN HOSPITALS. WITH OUR PATIENTS AND. SOMETIMES IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING IT'S NO SLAM AGAINST% ANYBODY IS JUST. THERE'S A TON OF PEOPLE THAT ARE BACKING UP OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. IT'S MORE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU HAVE LIMITED. COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES WE'VE SERVED IN RURAL AREAS. THAT HAVE VERY LIMITED. AMBULANCES AND MEDICS AVAILABLE. TO RESPOND WHEN YOU'RE TYING THEM UP IN IN MY PARTICULAR COUNTIES CASE. WHERE I SERVE? YOU CAN BE EVERY MEDIC. LEAVING AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OTHER THAN THE MUTUAL AID. AND THE GETS PULLED AND WE HAVE TO ASK FOR MERCED OR FRESNO OR MARIPOSA DRAMATIC. ISSUE. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE BACKED UP IF WE COULD LIST. ANALYZES AND THAT THIS BILL HELPS GET THAT INFORMATION I'M ALL FOR IT. SO I THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT I I HOPE THAT THE HOSPITALS WOULD LOOK AT THIS IS A POSITIVE AND AND I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU TO TRY TO. SOLVE WHATEVER ISSUE THERE IS. ON THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENED I'M GOING TO SEE THIS INFORMATION GAINED. THAT'S TRUE OF EVERY SPOTTERS OF COURSE I JUST THIS IS NOT THIS THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO BE PUNITIVE.

WALDRON AYE. THAT'S ELEVEN ZERO THAT'S THAT WHO IS OUT TO. WHICH YOU LIKE TWO PROHIBITS A DOT AUDIT STANDARDS ARE BEING APPLIED RETROACTIVELY. THE MEDI CAL ELLIE A BILLING PROGRAM PROVIDES FUNDING FOR CRITICAL SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES WHICH SUPPORT THE HEALTH AND ACADEMICS EXCESS. OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. RECENT FEDERAL CHANGES WILL ALLOW SCHOOLS TO SERVE MANY MORE STUDENTS THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST. BUT AT A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA SCHOOL SHOULD BE WRAPPING UP THEIR EFFORTS TO WRITE HEALTH SERVICES TO MORE STUDENTS. SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN ENDING THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM TURNING DOWN MATCHING FUNDS FEDERAL FUNDS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. THIS IS BECAUSE IN RECENT YEARS SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY LOTS OF DIFFICULTY. RECEIVING CLEAR AND CONSISTENT GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE ON HOW TO BILL FOR SERVICES IN A COMPLIANT MANNER. IN ADDITION CURRENT AUDIT STANDARDS HAVE BEEN RETROACTIVELY APPLIED TO CLAIMS FOR PRIOR YEARS LEADING TO DISALLOWANCE IS FOR BUILDING. WHICH WAS DONE PROPERLY AT THE TIME. IN OTHER WORDS CHANGING HISTORY. CALIFORNIA ALREADY LAGS FAR BEHIND OTHER STATES IN THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS WE DRAW DOWN THESE PROGRAMS THREATEN HARD TO DISADVANTAGE OUR SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS EVEN FURTHER. THE MEDI CAL ELLIE A BILLING OPTION PROGRAM IS COMPLEX AND ELEAZAR REQUIRE CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS PROGRAM ACROSS OUR STATE. AB THIRTY ONE NINETY TWO WILL HELP MAINTAIN SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM SO THAT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS. CAN RECEIVE THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO BE HEALTHY AND SUCCEED IN THE CLASSROOM. WITH ME TODAY AND SUPPORT I HAVE DIANNE PORTERFIELD DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF BUSINESS SERVICES FOR THE SAN MATEO. COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND ERICA HOFFMAN LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. THERE. ORDER FILLED AND I AM THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF BUSINESS SERVICES FOR THE SAN MATEO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. I'VE SERVE THERE FOR EIGHT YEARS SAN MATEO COE RAMMED THE ONLY A BUILDING OPTION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. CEMETERY COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION SUPPORTS THE PREMISE OF PURPOSE OF A B. THIRTY ONE NINETY TWO BECAUSE OUR EXPERIENCE OPERATING THE ELLIOT BILLING OPTION PROGRAM. AND THE DIFFICULTIES THAT WE ENCOUNTER. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED MINIMAL GUIDANCE TO ELEAZAR THAT SERVICES PROVIDED BY TRAIN HEALTH CARE AIDES. COULD BE CLAIMED UNDER THE LA A BILLING OPTIONS. TRAINED HEALTH CARE AIDES PROVIDE ASSISTIVE CARE TO STUDENTS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR STUDENTS TO ACCESS THEIR EDUCATION. ASSISTED CARE SUCH AS ADMINISTRATING ADMINISTERING MEDICATIONS GASTRIC TUBE FEEDINGS SEIZURE CARE TRACHEOTOMY TOOK CARE. AND SECTIONING TO INVEST IN SURE A STUDENT DOES NOT SUFFOCATE. WITHOUT THESE SERVICES MANY OF THE STUDENTS THAT SAN MATEO COE SERVICE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE IN THE CLASSROOM WITH THEIR PEERS. BASED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S GUIDELINES AND USING THE GUIDELINES PROVIDED SAN MATEO CO WE BECAME CLAIMING FOR SERVICES BY TRAINED HEALTH CARE AIDES. BEGINNING WITH. EIGHT OH NINE SCHOOL YEAR. HOWEVER IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SAN MATEO SUEY WAS AUDITED AND NEARLY ALL OF OUR CLAIMS WORD UNDER. TRAINS HEALTH CARE AIDES WERE DISALLOWED. THE DEPARTMENT STATED THAT THE REASON THESE CLAIMS WERE DISALLOWED US BECAUSE WE FAILED TO PROPERLY DOCUMENT THE SERVICES THAT WERE PROVIDED. AT THE TIME OF THAT THESE CLAIMS ARE SUBMITTED SAN MATEO WAS A HEARING TO THE CURRENT CLAIMING GUIDELINES PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENTS. HOWEVER BY THE TIME WE WERE AUDITED THE DEPARTMENT HAD PUT OUT NEW GUIDELINES IN JUNE TWENTY THIRTEEN. PROCLAIMING FOR TRAINED HEALTH CARE AIDES AND THESE WERE THE GUIDELINES OF THE AUDITOR'S USED. IN TOTAL NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF OUR ELLIOT BILLING OPTION CLAIMS WERE DISALLOWED THIS AMOUNTED TO FOUR MILLION. IN LOSSES OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD TO SAN MATEO COUNTY OFFICE OF THAT. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN REINVESTED IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SAN MATEO APPEALED THE DECISION THE DEPARTMENT WAS ALSO THE APPELLATE BODY USING ANOTHER ADMINISTRATOR AS THE HEARING AUDITOR. AFTER THE DECISION AND SEVERAL FAILED ATTEMPTS TO GET CLEAR GUIDANCE ON HOW TO CLAIM. FOR TRAINED HEALTHCARE IF THEY. HEALTH CARE AIDES GOING FORWARD SAN MATEO CO WE DROPPED OUT OF THE PROGRAM IN THIS COMPLETELY NOT MADE ANY CLAIMS. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN SCHOOL YEAR. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT ELLIE AB OWING OPTION PROGRAM IS OF VALUABLE TOOL TO HELP STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS ACCESS EDUCATION. THE LACK OF GUIDANCE AND AROUND AROUND CLAIMING AND THE HUGE DISALLOWANCE IS THAT RESULTED. MADE OUR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION UNTENABLE. SINCE SAM MATTEO NO LONGER PARTICIPATING IN THIS ALL COSTS FOR TREAT HEALTH CARE AIDES ARE CHARGED TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS PARTICIPATING IN OUR PROGRAM. PULLING MORE FUNDS AWAY FROM EDUCATION. I'M HERE SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE FISCAL IN PROGRAM COMPLIANCE GUIDE WOULD HELP TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE AMBIGUITY AROUND CLAIMING. AND WOULD DECREASE THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF AUDIT DISALLOWANCE WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY. THAT WE CAN RE ENTER THE PROGRAM FOR THAT REASON WE ASK FOR AN AYE. ERICA HOPPING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. ON AS A PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR SOMEONE USED TO ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD. TO FOLLOW THE SAME CEMETERY COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION I JUST WANT TO SAY. THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES FEDERAL MONEY TO SCHOOLS. FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE INCONSISTENCIES IN AUDIT GUIDES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DISTRICTS ARE DROPPING LIKE FLIES OUT OF THIS PROGRAM. AS WE ALL TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ALL STUDENTS. THE NEED TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES STUDENTS. THIS IS A BIG HUGE DISINCENTIVE RIGHT NOW IF WE CAN GET AUDIT GUIDE THE DISTRICTS COULD FOLLOW. THAT DISTRICTS KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THEY NEED TO GO AND HOW THEY NEEDED TO FILE THEIR CLAIMS. THAT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS. RESOURCE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE VERY STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND WE VERY STRONGLY URGE RIVA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON OTHERS TO SUPPORT. HELEN ROTH DOWDEN TEACHERS FOR HEALTHY KIDS IN FULL SUPPORT THIS IS REALLY AN ISSE THAT. THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO WEIGH IN ON THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANTED TO START RETHINKING OF THE CHAIR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE SEVENTEEN. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS ONE AND OF EVERY CALIFORNIANS DOES NOT KNOW WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL COMES FROM AND ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN. IN CALIFORNIA GO TO BED HUNGRY EVERY EACH NIGHT.

YES GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHAEL VALLEY AND THE DIRECTOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ENVIRONMENT HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS. AND THE DIRECTOR FOR THE A DEFENSE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA AND I JUST WANTED POINT OUT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS WITH SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO IDENTIFY SOME REASONABLE SOLUTIONS. TO THE CURRENT CODE WHICH IS VERY RESTRICTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO PERMIT THIS TYPE OF THAT OPERATION AND WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR US TO HAVE A SECONDARY TIER. OF ESSENTIALLY REGISTRATION THAT WOULD ALLOW FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO. FOLD IN THIS TYPE OF OPERATION WHICH TYPICALLY IS OCCURRING OUTSIDE OF REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND THE FOCUS FOR US IS REALLY ON. ACCESS IN FOOD SAFETY AND BEING ABLE TO SERVE AS A POPULATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME DECISIONS ABOUT ACCESS TO FOOD THAT YOU AND I DO EVERYDAY. AND SO WE SEE THIS IS A GREAT WAY FOR US TO. SORT OF BRIDGE THE GAP THAT'S EXISTED FOR MANY MANY YEARS ON THIS TYPE OF AN OPERATION. SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WOULD BE HAPPY TO OPEN IT UP.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS FOR COMPREHENSIVE CONTINUUM OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE FOR YOUTH UNDER AGE TWENTY ONE. THE BILL IDENTIFIES MONEY FROM PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR THE SYSTEM OF CARE. RATHER THAN ALLOCATING PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FUNDS IT THIS BILL SIMPLY RECOGNIZES MONEY THAT IS ALREADY SUPPOSED TO BE USED. FOR THE YOUTH EDUCATION PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT ACCOUNT. FOR CONTEXT UP TO NINETY PERCENT OF ADULTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER DEVELOP THE PATTERN OF ALCOHOL OR DRUG DEPENDENCE BEFORE EACH EIGHTEEN. AND UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA HAS NOT CHOSEN TO INVEST. AND A ROBUST SYSTEM OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE FOR UNINSURED. AND MEDICAID ELIGIBLE YOUTHS. WHILE COUNTIES MANAGE PUBLICLY FUNDED TREATMENT PROGRAMS THEY LACK SYSTEMIC GUIDANCE. SYSTEMATIC GUIDANCE AND DEDICATED FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF SERVICES FOR THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. ESTABLISHING STATEWIDE STANDARDS WILL BE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR YOUTH TREATMENT PROGRAMS. WITH ME IN SUPPORT. OUR DOCTOR. OF WITH BILL WILLIAM ARROYO FROM THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION AND TOM RENT FREE FROM THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS A MISTER RANDALL HAGAR MONTH BILL. ARE GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS DOCTOR WILLIAM ARROYO AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION AS ITS CURRENT PRESIDENT. WE REPRESENT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED PSYCHIATRISTS. ACROSS THE STATE I WANT TO THANK THE. CHAIRING THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I WANT TO START BY. I DESCRIBING WHAT MY CLINICAL WORK IN TALES I WORK WITH THAT I USED TO HAVE HAD. MINOR BRUSHES WITH THE LAW HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES AND TEMPORARY. TEMPORARILY PLACED IN A FACILITY OPERATED BY THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THEIR AGE RANGES FROM TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN IN VIRTUALLY ALL ARE BLACK. OR LATINO AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT UPSET YOU TAP MODERATE TO SEVERE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROBLEMS WHICH INCLUDES ALCOHOL. IT'S VERY COMMON FOR THE PARENTS TO REPORT THAT THERE SUBSTANCE USE IS THEIR PRIMARY CONCERN. IT SHOULD NOT ONLY BE CONCERNED THAT THEIR PARENTS BUT ALSO TO EVERYONE IN THIS HEARING. MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE INTOXICATED WHEN THEY COMMITTED THEIR FACTS. THESE YOUNG PEOPLE REPRESENT THE FUTURE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE IF THEY LABEL LONG ENOUGH. AND DON'T DIE PREMATURELY DUE EITHER TO THEIR DRUG USE OR OTHER RISKY BEHAVIORS. IF THEY DON'T DIE AND I'M NOT HELPED THEY MAY JOIN THE RATS RANKS OF THE MUSHROOMING POPULATION OF HOMELESS YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. MANY OF THESE YOU STILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS BUT WITHOUT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT. WILL NOT LIKELY GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND A RECYCLE JAILS AND PRISONS THEREBY BECOMING A LIFELONG BURDEN. TO OUR STATE. WE KNOW FROM RECENT STUDIES THAT MARIJUANA ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE DEVELOPING BRAIN. IT CONTINUES TO DEVELOP THROUGH EARLY ADULTHOOD. SUCH A FAX INCLUDE PROBLEMS WITH MEMORY ATTENTION AND LEARNING OFTEN RESULT IN A SCHOOL FAILURE. A VERY RECENT SCIENTIFIC STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE BRAINS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO STARTED DRINKING ALCOHOL HEAVILY AT AN EARLY AGE. HAVE BRAINS WHICH IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS EARLY DRINKING PATTERN. FUNCTION DIFFERENTLY FROM THOSE YOU TO. DID NOT ENGAGE IN SUCH BEHAVIOR. AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY EIGHT PROVIDES OUR STATE ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THAT SECOND CHANCE TO PURSUE THEIR DREAMS. SPIKE THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN ENTITLEMENT THROUGH THE FEDERAL MEDICARE PROGRAM TO MEET THEIR NEEDS ARE HEALTH SYSTEMS HAS. FAILED THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE RESTRUCTURE OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT IN CALIFORNIA IT'S WAY OVERDUE. AND OF COURSE AS WE JUST MENTIONED PRODUCTS PROP SIXTY FOUR PROVIDES. SOME RESOURCES FOR DEVELOPING AND SUSTAINING THAT CONTINUUM OF CARE. NECESSARY FOR THESE YOUNGSTERS TO RESUME A NORMAL DEVELOPMENT. PROTECTING YOUNG PEOPLE'S BRAINS SHOULD NOT BE AN OPTION. IN ADDITION THERE'S A MAJOR COST AVOIDANCE BY CARRYING OUT AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY EIGHT IN MULTIPLE SECTORS INCLUDING HEALTH. JUVENILE JUSTICE CRIMINAL JUSTICE CHILD WELFARE EDUCATION AMONG OTHERS. SO LET'S DO THE RIGHT THING AND IDEA IMPLORE YOU TO. A PORT AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS TOM RENT FREE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. ANYONE WHO HAS EVER HAD OCCASION TO TRY TO FIND. TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR AN ADOLESCENT WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AN AGE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT PROGRAM KNOWS HOW DIFFICULT IT IS THERE ARE VERY FEW OUR YOUTH A SPECIFIC PROVIDERS LONG WAITING LISTS. I MOST YOUTH THE NEED OF AT THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT DID NOT RECEIVE CARE WITH AN ESTIMATED TREATMENT RATES AS LOW AS ONE. NOW IN TEN. TWENTY YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. THERE WAS A STATUTE PASSED BY THIS BODY THAT THAT REQUIRED THE STATE TO ESTABLISH A YOUTH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SYSTEM OF CARE. THAT WAS NEVER DONE AYE THERE WERE NO REGULATIONS WERE WRITTEN THERE WERE NO STANDARDS DEVELOPED. OUT WE THINK THIS IS THE TIME TO MAYBE COME BACK NOW THAT WE HAVE THE ACCESS TO A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF FUNDING THROUGH THE USE YOU'VE EDUCATION PREVENTION. IT EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT ACCOUNT. WE THINK IT'S TIME TO REALLY I GET BACK AND FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE AND GET OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. THAT NEED THIS HELP THAT THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED SO WE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN LATER FOR THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION URGING YOUR SUPPORT HERE FOR ANY QUESTION THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. MELISSA I'M ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD OLD PLAIN CITIZEN AGAIN. PATRICIA WETZEL IN SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. MICHELLE EVANS AT THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN SUPPORT. BECAME. SO REALLY ONE IN OPPOSITION. SAY NO ONE WILL BRING BACK THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OF TERMS BIGELOW. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. MAYBE YOU COULD. GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO COST AND. MAYBE A LITTLE MORE. FOCUSED IN ON. WHERE WE'RE GONNA FIND FUNDS TO ACCOMPLISH THE? MUCH NEEDED RESULTS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY BY THE WAY THIS IS THIS IS A GOOD BILL WITH GOOD DIRECTION. IT'S JUST IT'S. LACKING IN THIS AREA SO IF YOU COULD HELP ANSWER THAT I CHERISH IT SURE. A THANK YOU AND AND THANKS FOR THE QUESTION THAT AND. WHAT WE KNOW AT A BIG PERCENTAGE? A PERCENT OF THE FUNDS. AND PROP SIXTY FOUR ARE GOING TO BE. GOING TOWARDS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ALSO EARLY INTERVENTION WHEN IT COMES TO DRUG USE SO. INSTEAD OF BEING PRESCRIPTIVE AND SAYING THAT. EXACTLY WHERE THE MONEY AND HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COME WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP THAT. OPEN SO THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH. CONTINUE WORKING THROUGH IF WE NEED TO LOOK AT SPECIFICS I'M. I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU. AT THERE'S A TEAM HERE OF EXPERTS ALSO WHO. WOULD DEATH BE MORE THAN WILLING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC. I GUESS IT'S A PART OF MINE. JUST. LEARNING THE EXPERIENCE BEING THE FIRST TIME ON THE COMMITTEE TODAY ON. POLICY IS ONE THING AND YOU HAVE A GOOD SOLID POLICY DOCUMENT HERE IS JUST THE LACKING PORT OF IT PART OF MOVING FORWARD TO THE APPROPRIATIONS. ELEMENT WOULD BE THE FUNDING MECHANISM SO I. I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT QUESTION SO THAT YOU CAN START. A CARING FOR THOSE. ANSWERS. NOW AND IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR FOLKS WHO BRING BILLS ALLEN. IT ALWAYS IDENTIFY WHERE THAT MONEY'S GOING TO COME FROM BECAUSE TO OFTEN AND WE'VE SAID IT HERE TODAY SEVERAL TIMES. TOO OFTEN. WE DON'T INCLUDE THAT CARD MORE PROVE YOUR SOMETHING BLINDLY. SIR I'M JUST ASKING THE QUESTION. BECAUSE I DON'T. I HAVE NO REASON TO OPPOSE THIS BILL ON A POLICY STANDPOINT. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO GET THE FUNDING COMPONENT AND I APPRECIATE THAT OF BECAUSE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT. IF THERE'S. THE MORE SPECIFIC RESPONSE. I'M SOME IN BIGELOW SO THE EAP THE FEDERAL EPA STT MANDATE A FOR MEDICAID ELIGIBLE YOUTH CAN COVER. THE COST FOR THE TREATMENT COMPONENT AND OF COURSE THAT'LL HELP DRAW DOWN ALSO MATCHING FEDERAL FUNDS. I IS FAR AS BUILDING WE REALLY NEED TO BUILD A SYSTEM OF CARE THAT DOESN'T EXIST SO FOR INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY EXPANSION THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE WERE HOPING TO LOOK AT MAYBE SOME OF THE. BEING ABLE TO ACCESS. THE FUNDS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE YOUTH EDUCATION. EARLY INTERVENTION TREATMENT A CALENDAR PROP SIXTY FOUR. YOU KNOW THERE ARE. FEDERAL GRANTS THERE MAY BE SOME STATE GRANT MONEY AVAILABLE THAT WE CAN ACCESS AS WELL I WOULD I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS PROBABLY MULTIPLE SOURCES OF OF. FUNDING. YEAH AND HAVE IF I MAY ADD. THEY'D BE ABLE HEALTH SYSTEM THE PUBLIC BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM CALIFORNIA FRANKLY IS COMPRISED OF MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS IF WE WERE TO DESIGN IT TODAY WE WOULD NOT HAVE. FUNDING STRUCTURES CURRENTLY IN PLACE FRANKLY. UP BUT THAT BEING SAID. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT AS THIS INITIATIVE SHOULD IT. GET THROUGH THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR THAT HE WOULD GO TO SCALE IN THE FIRST YEAR. WE FORESEE THAT. THERE THERE WOULD BE. INCREMENTAL EXPANSIONS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND SO. WITH THAT IN MIND IT'S IT'S REALLY HARD TO COME UP WITH. WHAT EXACTLY WOULD BE THE PRICE TAG FOR THE FIRST YEAR BUT I I WOULD? ALL BUT THE CERTAIN THAT. THAT. OUT COSTS FOR. IMPLEMENT THE SERVICE WHAT BUT BE INCREASED BUT LIKE AND LET'S KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE IS A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT. SO THAT WE WOULD. HOPEFULLY DRIVE DOWN SUFFICIENT FEDERAL DOLLARS TO SUPPORT ITS INITIATION AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT EXPANSION. SO IN THE. PEOPLE TO SAY THAT WERE POPULAR. FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT ONE PERSON. RELATIONS WOULD BE IN EFFECT NUMBER TO USE FOR. AND THEN YOU CAN GROW FROM THERE. IF YOU HAD AN AVERAGE OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PATIENT. YOU CAN SEE THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY LARGE NUMBER SO THE CONCERN THAT I'M RAISING. IS A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT ONE TO THE AUTHOR I THINK THE POLICY IS SOUND IN GOING IN AND IN HIS DIRECTION I JUST WOULD LIKE TO WORK THROUGH THIS THAT WE CAN DEFINE. WITH AN OPEN SET OF EYES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT VERY LARGE BITE OUT OF THE. THEY THINK YOU GOT I I'M VERY COGNIZANT I APPRECIATE YOU STRESSING THAT POINT AND I'M GONNA ASK. DOCTOR ARROYO TO ANSWER IT BUT ONE POINT THAT I DID FORGET WAS. WENT ON IT WE WE WERE INITIALLY TALKING ABOUT THIS CONCEPT AND THIS IDEA I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THAT HOW MUCH FEDERAL DOLLARS WE'RE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. AND IF THERE WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO NOT TAP INTO GENERAL FUND BUT USE FUNDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING IN AND HOPE. LAW. EXPANDING OVER TIME. BECAUSE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR. IMPLEMENTATION OF OF OF OF. THE NEW INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THAT AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A LOT OF FEDERAL DOLLARS AS WELL THAT WAS. THAT WAS THE MOTIVATING FACTOR. YEAH IT FIVE FIVE MAY BE FURTHER INDULGED. I WOULD SAY THAT. AS THIS BEGINS TO BE IMPLEMENTED AND TO EXPAND WE WILL SEE COST SAVINGS IN OTHER SECTORS. SO I IT'S FAR. BETTER ESTIMATING THE COST IS RATHER CALM COMPLICATED IN THAT. WE WOULD HOPE TO SEE COST SAVINGS. IN OTHER COMPONENTS OF HEALTH CARE. JUVENILE JUSTICE I EDUCATION AND SO FORTH SO. ALTHOUGH. AT AT. FIRST GLANCE. THERE WOULD BE A COSTS FOR DATA. TREATMENT. BUT IT WOULD BE OFFSET BY COSTS AND OTHER SECTORS. DO SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND. HE RICH MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. BUT YESTERDAY I HAD THE CHANCE TO MEET WITH THE FOLKS FROM THIS THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY INITIATIVE. WORKING ON. SEVERAL DIFFERENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS ON. AND ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING FACTS THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING SOME STUDIES IN NEUROSCIENCE. AND ITS EFFECTS MUM ASSOCIATED WITH YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO GET ADDICTIONS OF ISSUES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND I FOUND THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT USE FROM THE AGES OF ELEVEN TO TWENTY FIVE IS THE HIGHEST CHANCE THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET ADDICTED THAT'S WHEN THE BRAIN IS AT THAT WEIRD STAGE THAT YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW A LOT BETTER THAN I DO AS FAR AS THE TERMINOLOGY BUT. THAT'S THIS POINT OF TIME A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY WHERE. AND THAT IT'S BEEN A FRUSTRATION BECAUSE WE HAVE FAILED I THINK IS THE CALIFORNIA. TO PUT MONEY INTO TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE AND CO OCCURRING DISORDER MENTAL HEALTH. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE STILL HAVING TO PAY AT THE OTHER END. SO. THE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY HAD. ONE THING I STARTED ALL OVER BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN MY BIGGEST HOME ISSUES WITH CALIFORNIA'S THAT THEY JUST HAVE NOT COME TO THE REALIZATION THAT THEY NEED TO PUT MONEY TOWARDS OPIOID. ABUSE. AND TREATMENTS. AND IT'S IT JUST DOESN'T HEAR THAT. COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA ARGUES THAT EXTENSIVE RESEARCH CONFIRMS THAT TREATMENT IS A HIGHLY COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE HARM FROM SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS WHILE SAVING MONEY ELSEWHERE IN THE HEALTH CARE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS WHICH IS THE OTHER IMPACT. BUT CALIFORNIA HAS YET TO INVEST IN DEVELOPING OFF OR FUNDING A COMPREHENSIVE CONTINUUM OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES FOR UNINSURED AND MEDICAID ELIGIBLE YOU. SO IT IS A HUGE ISSUE. I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING FORTH. WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS A WHICH IS WHERE WE USE IN THE RUN UP. UNTIL WALL BUT ANYWAY I WISH YOU THE BEST THANK YOU. I'D BE HONORED TO HAVE YOU AS A CO AUTHOR. YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN. THANK YOU. TO ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MISTER NAZARIAN. SEEN THEM WOULD YOU LIKE. JEFF. WHICH A CLOSENESS USER I RESPECTFULLY ASK ARRIVAL CAN WE HAVE A MOTION AND. FROM MISTER THURMAN A SECOND FROM MISTER AGUILAR CURRY MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. METACRITIC PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHERE IF I WOULD AYE MAYES MAYES AYE ACCURATE VERY. ACTOR CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BIGELOW AYE BONTA. BURKE. BURKE AYE CARILLO. CARILLO AYE FLORA. LARA AYE LIMA. MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE NAZARIAN AYE SYRIAN AYE RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ I SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE THURMAN. BERMAN I WALDRON. WALDRON AYE. THAT'S THIRTEEN ZERO YOUR BILL WAS OUT MISTER NAZARIAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH LEAVE IT OPEN FOR OTHERS. OF MISTER SANTIAGO AND MR CHEN. SO MISTER SANTIAGO WILL BE PRESENTING AND MR CHANNEL BE PRESENTING A. B. NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE MISTER CHAN HAS AGREED TO HOLD HIS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR BILL. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY SIX AND JOIN THIS BILL AS A AS A AS A PRINCIPLE AS A JOINT AUTHOR. WITH. MISTER SANTIAGO THESE REQUESTED EQUAL TIME TO PRESENT TO US WE'VE AGREED TO FOR WITNESSES. AFTER AT TWO MINUTES EACH TOTAL FOR THE PRESENTATION OF THE BILL IN THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN HAS BEEN GIVEN EQUAL WILL WILL BE GIVEN EQUAL TIME SO. PLEASE PROCEED. MISTER SANTIAGO AND THEN MR CHEN. HERE NO. POSSIBLE GIVEN THE THE. BILL. I LIKE THE FIRST EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE STOP YOURSELF AND OTHERS FOR HELPING US TO WORK THROUGH THIS BILL. AS AMENDED AB NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE WHICH CHANGE DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED TO INCLUDE MEDICAL TREATMENT WITH THE INABILITY OR FAILURE TO RECEIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT WILL RESULT. IN DETERIORATING PHYSICAL CONDITION OR DEATH. THE LOST THE CURRENT LAW STILL FAILS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AREN'T TO PROVIDE. A FOR THEIR MEDICAL FOR THEIR NEEDED MEDICAL TREATMENT. OTHER MENTAL ILLNESS AXES A BARRIER FOR THEM TO ACCEPT SUCH MEDICAL CARE LEAVING MANY OF THEM ON THE STREETS AND SEVERELY ILL. AB NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE WOULD PROVIDE AWAY TO BRING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND POTENTIALLY SAVED OUR LIVES WHILE MAINTAINING THE STATUTORILY PROTECTED SAFEGUARDS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. OF MY COLLEAGUE WOULD ALSO. BE PRESENTING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS FIRST AND FOREMOST WHEN I THINK OF SOMETHING ON MIGUEL SANTIAGO MORE FREEDOM FROM MOMMY. PRESENT THIS BILL. ON I HAD THE DISTINCT PLEASURE OF BEING THE HEALTH THE MENTAL DEBT BEFORE FORMER LA COUNTY SUPERVISOR MIKE ANTONOVICH FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS. AND DO THAT TIME WILL NUMBERS I'VE SEEN THROUGH LOS SO THE LOS ALTOS HOMELESS HOUSING AUTHORITY. WAS AT ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE FOLKS ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. THE FOLKS THAT YOU SEE ON THE STREET WITH IT SKID ROW IN PASADENA. THOSE FOLKS SUFFER FROM CO OCCURRING DISORDERS. MEANING THEY HAVE. DRUNKEN SUBSIDIES ISSUES NOW MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OFTENTIMES HAVE PRIMARY CARE ISSUES. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO TREAT THEM. PART OF THE PROCESS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL WAS BEING PASSED ME CHANGE A TERM GRIP IT'S STABLE. THE HOMELESS ISSUE WITH A MULTI PRONGED PROBLEM THAT A MULTI PRONGED SOLUTION. OF COURSE HOUSING IS PART OF THAT COMPONENT. BUT IN ADDITION SHOULD THAT. WE CAN TAKE THE PROBLEM THAT WHICH WE SEE ON THE STREET IN DAYTON GIVEN TO HOUSING. BUT IN MY OPINION THAT'S CALLED WHERE HOUSING WITHOUT HEALING. THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. WE ALL KNOW A FORMER ELECTED OFFICIAL MEMBERS ALL AKON. FORMER LA CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FORMER MEMBER OF THE SENATE. AS WE STAND HERE TODAY AND WE HAVE A DIALOGUE AND DEBATE. HIS SON IS ON THE STREETS HOMELESS AS WE SPEAK HE CERTAINLY HAS THE POLITICAL INFLUENCE. AND THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO GET HIS HOUSE HIS SON TREATMENT. UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THE SUN IS EIGHTEEN OLD AN ADULT. HE CANNOT DO THAT. THIS BILL IS ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. CHEN. I'M SORRY MISTER CHAIR BUT WE HAVE ONE OF THE OTHER OR JOINT AUTHORS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AMBER'S I WE ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS AND WE KNOW THAT SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. CREATES OFTEN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS FOR HOMELESS RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND SADLY WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE DYING IN OUR STREETS WE SEE IT EVERYDAY IN MY DISTRICT. AS NOTED BY MY COLLEAGUE MISTER SANTIAGO IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS DIED ON THE STREETS LAST YEAR. EIGHT HUNDRED. FOR ME THAT'S INEXCUSABLE WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO GET PEOPLE IN CRISIS THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. AS YOUR ANALYSIS POINTS OUT CALIFORNIA HAS PATHWAYS TO THE COURTS TO REQUIRE INDIVIDUALS TO GET TREATMENT EVEN WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. HOWEVER THE DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED DOESN'T FULLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DANGER MANY PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES ARE IN. IT DOESN'T CLEARLY ACCOUNT FOR THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS AND A DOZEN MEASURED INDIVIDUALS UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR OWN HEALTH. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION AND I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME SIDE WE WANT CALIFORNIANS IN CRISIS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. AS A JOINT AUTHORED ON THIS BILL I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN FIND A MIDDLE GROUND IN WAYS THAT WE CAN SATISFY THE CONCERNS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSE BUT ALSO ADDRESS ARE VERY REAL AND GROWING CRISIS ON OUR STREETS. MY RESIDENTS DO NOT WANT TO WALK PAST PEOPLE THAT THEY KNOW WITHOUT INTERVENTION ARE GOING TO BE DEAD IN A MONTH SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR. IS JUST UNCONSCIONABLE THEY WANT US TO HAVE THE TOOLS TO GET PEOPLE THE HELP THAT THEY NEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. PLEASE. JOHN SHARON DIRECTOR OF MENTAL HEALTH LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WE I THINK ALL KNOW THAT WE ARE FAILING AS A SYSTEM ARE MOST. VULNERABLE. MENTALLY ILL. INDIVIDUALS ARE ACROSS THE STATE. OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS KNOW LAKE COUNTY. ARE COMPELLED MYSELF AS WELL AS OUR COUNTY COUNCIL IS WITH ME TODAY. TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION AND GET RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A VERY BROAD SET OF STAKEHOLDERS WHICH WE. DID OVER MANY MANY MONTHS. FROM THAT. EFFORT WE LET WE BECAME TO CONCLUSIONS THAT YES WE DO NEED MUCH MORE INTENSIVE PREVENTION EFFORTS WE NEED MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE OUTPATIENT CARE YES WE NEED MORE RESIDENTIAL CARE. AND WE NEED MORE HOUSING PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS BUT IN ADDITION THAT WE NEEDED MORE ENGAGEMENT TOOLS AND% PARTICULARLY ENGAGEMENT TOOLS FOR THOSE. WHO ARE SUFFERING AND YOU ARE VERY RESISTANT TO GETTING CARE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL? IS ALL ABOUT. ENGAGEMENT REALLY AT ITS CORE. AT THE TOP OF THE LIST INVOLVES A HEART FORWARD APPROACH TO ENGAGE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING BUT FOR THOSE WHO WILL NOT ENGAGE WE MUST FIGURE OUT WAYS TO MORE EFFECTIVELY. HELP THEM AND THAT IN MANY CASES. FOR THE MOST SEVERELY ILL REQUIRES SURROGATE DECISION MAKING. WE SEE THIS IS A CLARIFICATION OF LPS LAW. SPIRIT. BEING INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT PROVIDE FOR THEIR BASIC NEEDS INCLUDING FOOD CLOTHING SHELTER AND SELF CARE. REQUIRE AND MUST GET FOR HUMANE REASONS ASSISTANCE IN MAKING. DECISIONS CRITICAL TO THEIR WELL BEING. EXTERIOR RATIONS PHYSICALLY. IS AN INDICATOR. UPGRADE DISABILITY. AND THE FOR ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND INCORPORATE THAT INTO OUR PRACTICE BUT THAT'S FIRST RESPONDERS. CLINICIANS AS WELL AS IN THE COURTS WE WILL BE DOING A GREAT. JUSTICE TO THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING AND MANY DYING IN THE STREETS IN BIGGER NUMBERS. EVERY YEAR. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DIANE XIN STOCK. JUST AN AVERAGE CITIZEN BUT A MOTHER OF A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD SON WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. ALSO THE MOTHER OF THREE OTHER ADULT CHILDREN WHO ARE THRIVING IN DOING WHILE AND WE DON'T REALLY. OR HEARTBROKEN ABOUT MY OTHER SON AND HAS. PREDICAMENT. MY SON HAS SUFFERED WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS SINCE HE WAS A CHILD HE'S BEEN LABELED PREDOMINANTLY SCHIZOPHRENIC COMPLICATED BY SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND HE LACKS ANY INSIGHT INTO HIS ILLNESS. HE IS ONE OF THE RESISTANT. INDIVIDUAL SO IT WAS JUST TALKED ABOUT. I'M HE MET CRITERIA FOR GRAVELY DISABLED FOR SEVEN YEARS. AND IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN MY COUNTY SAID HE NO LONGER QUALIFIED CITING SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS HIS PRIMARY PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEFINITION OF MENTAL ILLNESS DOES NOT EXCLUDE CO OCCURRING DISORDERS. SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND HE HAD NEVER LOOKED WORSE. HE BELIEVES HE'S TO PARKS RECORDINGS OFTEN UNCERTAIN OF WHO I AM MOSTLY CONVINCED I'M A CRACK ADDICT WHO WILL NOT GET OUT OF HIS HOUSE. HE HAS ANNOUNCEMENT THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF IN COUNTY JAIL IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR HIS OWN PROTECTION. FOR SIX CUTTING OFF ANGLE MONITORS VIOLATIONS OF PROBATION STEMMING FROM A RESTRAINING ORDER. THAT I WAS FORCED TO OBTAIN. HE DIDN'T COME OUT OF JAIL BETTER. THEN WHEN HE WENT IN BUT I SLEPT BETTER KNOWING THAT HE HAD A ROOF OVER HIS HEAD TO THE WINNER. THE FIRST TIME I TOLD MY SON WAS GRAVELY DISABLED I WAS DEVASTATED. WAS NOT WHAT I ENVISION WHEN THEY LEYVA VV IN MY ARMS THE VERY FIRST TIME. WHEN THE CONSERVATORSHIP WAS DROPPED WE SPIRALED INTO THE DARKEST FOUR YEARS OF OUR LIVES MY SON CALLED ME SOBBING BEGGING ME FOR HOW WE COULDN'T ARTICULATE WHAT THAT HOPE LOOK LIKE. NO ONE COULD CONVINCE HIM TO VOLUNTARILY ENGAGE IN SERVICES. JAIL ISN'T THE ANSWER NEITHER OF THE STREETS BUT HE'S NOT WELCOME AT ANY OF THE CURRENT HOUSING OPTIONS BECAUSE OF ITS UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS. THE SYSTEM'S FAILING MY SON AND HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF OTHERS JUST LIKE HIM. CURRENT LAWS ARE NOT INTERPRETED THE SAME BY COUNTIES PROVIDERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BECAUSE THE DEFINITION ISN'T CLEAR. SO AS YOU CONTEMPLATE YOUR DECISION TODAY ASK YOURSELVES WHAT IF THIS WAS YOU. WHAT IF YOU COULD SEE INTO THE FUTURE AND SAW THAT NEXT MONTH YOU'D EXPERIENCES SCHIZOPHRENIC BREAK% YOU HAVE NO INSIGHT INTO YOUR ILLNESS AND STUDY FOLLOWED YOUR DELUSIONAL THINKING? YOU LOSE YOUR JOB YOUR HOUSE ALL OF YOUR POSSESSIONS YOUR FAMILY WHO LOVES YOU. IS AFRAID OF YOU AND BEGINS TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM YOU OUT OF FEAR OF YOUR ERRATIC BEHAVIOR WHEN YOU'RE LEFT TO FIND A PLACE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. A DOORWAY STAIRWELL UNDER A BRIDGE YOU BEG FOR FOOD OR DIG SCRAPS OUT OF DUMPSTERS. YOUR NAY DEFECATE ON THE IN PUBLIC BECAUSE RESTROOMS ARE FOR CUSTOMERS ONLY. IN YOUR RIGHT MIND TODAY. WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO BE LEFT LIKE THAT WITH ALL YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS INTACT. OR WOULD YOU HOPE SOMEONE INTERVENES ON YOUR BEHALF. PLEASE SUPPORT THE BILL IT'S A FIRST STEP REALLY IN TRANSFORMING A SYSTEM THAT'S FAILING. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY MISTER CHAIR. MY NAME IS MICHELLE IS ARC. AND I'M A RECENTLY RETIRED POLICE OFFICER WITH TWENTY SIX YEARS ON THE FORCE. WITH THE SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT. I AM ALSO ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR NAMI SACRAMENTO. THE LAST THREE YEARS OF MY CAREER I WORKED ON A MOBILE CRISIS UNIT. I WAS ON THE ONLY. MOBILE CRISIS UNIT WITH THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. A ROOM WITH A CLINICIAN AND WE RESPONDED TO ALL CALLS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ELEMENT. I RODE. I WAS ALSO A CRISIS NEGOTIATE NEGOTIATOR IN THE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS NEW ME AS OFFICER MARSHALL. I WOULD OFTEN COUNTER PEOPLE WHO WERE DELUSIONAL. AND SYMPTOMATIC AND WHO DIDN'T FIT THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY CRITERIA. OF BEING A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS ARE GRAVELY DISABLED. THEY MAY HAVE BEEN ALERT AND ORIENTED. BUT ALERT BUT THEY WERE NOT ORIENTED. AND SOME SIMPLE ORIENTATION QUESTIONS I WOULD GIVE THEM. THEY WOULD TURN INTO A WORD SALAD. IN THE ANSWERS REPEAT GO IN AND THE QUESTIONS ARE GOING ANSWERED. THIS WAS TO THE POINT WHERE I FELT THAT IT DIDN'T MAKE THE COULD MAKE AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT. OF THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH. I WOULD ALSO LOOK AT OTHER FACTORS WHETHER THE PERSON HANDED ME NO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WHERE THEY WERE USING DRUGS POSSIBLY POLY DRUG USE OR? WHETHER THERE ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED OR THEY HADN'T EATEN WHAT MULTIPLE DAYS ARE A COMBINATION OF ALL. I OFTENTIMES HAD A GOOD RAPPORT WITH THIS DEMOGRAPHIC IN AND THEY KNEW WHO I WAS AND I KNEW WHO THEY WERE IN. AND IT OFTENTIMES I WOULD KNOW WHAT THEIR BASELINE WAS. IN WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS AND IF THEY WERE DE COME DE COMPENSATING. I WOULD LOOK AT THE SITUATION AND IF THERE WERE F. I WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE IF THEY WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOOD SHELTER AND CLOTHING FOR THEMSELVES. IF THEY WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOOD FOR THEMSELVES. EVEN IF THEY HAD TO BEG FOR IT OR GOES THE DUMPSTER. THEY THEY HAD FOOD THEY'RE CARRYING A BLANKET THEY WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE SHELTER. IF THEY HAD. IF THEY'RE WEARING CLOTHES IN THE WERE CLOSED IT IF THEY KNEW HOW TO GET TO WHERE DAY SHELTER. THEN THEY DID NOT MEET THE CRITERIA. THIS DIDN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE. OF THE PEOPLE WANDERING AROUND IN THE MIDST OF THEIR PSYCHOSIS. IF THEY DIDN'T MEET THE CRITERIA I OFTEN HAD TO LEAVE THEM TO DRAFT AND POTENTIALLY GOING TO SOME DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. IF THE BEHAVIOR WAS BIZARRE INTIMIDATING TO OTHERS IN THEY WOULDN'T. THEY WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTED INTO SHELTERS A RESPITE CENTERS. SO ABSENT ANY OTHER CHOICES I HAVE TO LEAVE IT IN THE MIDST OF THEIR HALLUCINATIONS PARKING AT CARS HIDING FROM. WOULD BE SNIPERS BATTLING SPIDERS GREAT FROM THEIR SKIN. THESE PEOPLE NEEDED A SAFE PLACE. TO BE AND WHETHER THEY WERE DETOXING FORMER DRUG OR THEY WERE EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUE. THESE I BELIEVE THAT. THAT THEY NEEDED HELP. SO. IF THAT MEANS MODIFYING THIS GRAVELY DISABLED BURBAGE TO GIVE OFFICERS AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS THE DISCRETIONARY ABILITY MORE OF A DISCRETIONARY ABILITY. TO GET THE PEOPLE TO THE MENTAL HEALTH. CENTERS FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH HELP. THAT THEY NEED. AND DESERVE. THEN I WOULD ASK YOU TO GIVE. BUT I VOTE. IF YOU THINK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN RENTAL HAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. I THINK YOU'VE HEARD ALL THE REASONS THAT YOU NEED HERE TODAY WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE YES ON THIS BILL. BUT LET ME JUST PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT. NO THE LPS ACTIVES FIFTY ONE YEARS OLD IT WAS DESIGNED TO HELP PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT HELP THEMSELVES. WE DESIGN CRITERIA DANGER TO SELF DANGER TO OTHERS GREATLY DISABLED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DISCRIMINATIONS ABOUT SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE. BUT AT AT AT AT THE VERY BOTTOM IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOW TO EVALUATE OUR RISK OF HARM FOR INDIVIDUALS. AND WHEN THE DRAFTERS DID THAT. THEY ESTABLISHED THREE CRITERIA FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER AS A CENTRAL HUMAN NEEDS. AND I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY NEVER CONSIDERED HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH NEEDS IN THAT. ANALYSIS BUT IT'S VERY VERY CLEAR TODAY THAT THE ISSUE HERE BEFORE US IS WHETHER OR NOT HEALTH NEEDS. OUR ESSENTIAL HUMAN NEEDS JUST LIKE FOO CLOTHING AND SHELTER. I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. PSYCHIATRISTS EVERY DAY HAVE TO. WATCH AS PATIENTS THAT THEY HAD MET TO SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD ARE THEN RELEASED AT A SUBSEQUENT FOURTEEN DAY HOLD. BECAUSE HEARING OFFICERS ARE NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE HEALTH ISSUES WHICH ARE OFTEN DIRE AND ACUTE FOR SOME OF THOSE PATIENTS ARE SUFFICIENT GROUNDS TO KEEP THEM FOR TREATMENT THAT IS BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH. SO WITH THAT I THINK I WILL CLOSE. I THINK. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH A FRIEND. THIS WEEKEND WAS A BOOK BY JOSEPH CAMPBELL A HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES. I THINK YOU HAVE TO THOSE HEROES RIGHT HERE WITH US HERE ON THE DYESS. AS FAMILY MEMBERS AND POLICE OFFICERS AND I THINK THAT. THE AUTHORS AND EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THIS ARE AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. CHAIR MEMBERS SAY JOHN ADDRESS WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE WE ARE VERY PROUD TO BE CO SPONSORS OF NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES A CLARITY NEEDED TO SAVE LIVES. THINK. HI AM JOANNA JUERGENS I AM A MOTHER TO US ON THAT SUFFERS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND I'M ALSO CURRENTLY ON THE BOARD OF SACRAMENTO NAMI AND I TOTALLY SUPPORT THIS IT'S MUCH NEEDED. THEY DRAIN MAHMOUD WHAT THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS IN STRONG SUPPORT. PATRICIA ON SO MOM OF THREE KIDS WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. I HAVE BI POLAR DISORDER. I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS POSITION. SO ANYONE IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KURT CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF A COALITION OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CIVIL RIGHTS. AND HOMELESS ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THIS. THIS LEGISLATION. ACT A COUPLE OF THINGS I JUST WANT TO ADD TO BE CLEAR DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST DISABILITY RIGHTS ORGANIZATION IN THE COUNTRY. WE REPRESENT INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UP AND DOWN MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ARE VERY CLIENTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S WHY YOU SEE US HERE. EVERYDAY ADVOCATING ON THE NEED FOR SERVICES THE NEED FOR TREATMENT. TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN BE. JUSTICE WERE. SUGGESTING HERE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING OFF THE STREETS AND LIVING THERE. HOPEFULLY PRODUCTIVE LIVES. WHERE WE'RE ALWAYS SKEPTICAL WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT? A THE CRISIS. AS THE NEED TO GO IN A DIRECTION WHERE WE CUT BACK FROM CIVIL RIGHTS. AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING. HERE IS MOVING AWAY FROM THE PROTECTIONS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE. TO BE SELF DETERMINED IT TO BE SELF DIRECTING. AND WE WOULD SUGGEST CERTAINLY THAT LPS HAS SERVED FOR DECADES THAT BALANCE THAT'S BEEN ESSENTIAL. BETWEEN INVOLUNTARY CARE AND TREATMENT AND THE ABILITY OF. INDIVIDUALS TO LIVE SELF DIRECTED. LIVES. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE I THINK THE. CONSULTANT DID AN EXCELLENT JOB ON THIS ANALYSIS AND I OFTENTIMES THESE ARGUMENTS GET LOST HERE AND. WHAT CAN BE THE THE EMOTIONS AND THE WHAT ARE ALWAYS THE HEART WRENCHING? STORIES THAT THAT WE HEAR BUT BUT TO AYE I THINK THE ANALYSIS DID KEEP THE FOCUS ON EXACTLY WHAT. LPS DOES WHAT IT HAS HISTORICALLY DONE AND WHY IT HAS BEEN LARGELY SUCCESSFUL. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE TOOK A LOOK AT THIS A FEW YEARS AGO WITH THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT DEMONSTRATION PROJECT THAT'S LAURA'S LAW. AND THE IN LAURA'S LAW TOOK SPECIFIC NOTICE OF THE VERY ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING RAISED. HERE IF I MIGHT JUST MAKE QUICKLY WE LAID OUT FOR YOU. IN OUR LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE WHAT WE THINK ARE THE CORE QUESTIONS THAT REALLY NEED TO BE ANSWERED. AND. RESOLVING AND GETTING. I THINK SOME CONSENSUS ON THIS ISSUE WE HAVE NOT HEARD UP FRONT. HOW MANY PEOPLE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE THE TESTIMONY TODAY LED US TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS BOTH AND LA AND AND STATEWIDE? WE HAVEN'T HEARD WHAT IS FOLKS ARE BUMPING UP AGAINST. THAT PRECLUDES THE. CONSERVATORSHIP PER INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS IS AT THE COURTS WHERE IS THAT BARRIER. AND AND I THINK WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE'RE HERE EVERY DAY SUGGESTING THE PROBLEM IS ONE THAT THERE IS NOT HOUSING AND THERE IS NOT ADEQUATE TREATMENT. AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON THE ASSURING SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ENSURING THAT THERE IS. THE CARE AND TREATMENT WE WOULD URGE YOUR. NO VOTE ON THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON JAN FLOREY FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. WE DO BELIEVE THAT AB AND NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE IS COMING FROM A GENUINE DESIRE TO ALLEVIATE THE GROWING CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS. BUT WE BELIEVE IT'S THE WRONG APPROACH. YET WE AGREED THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE DYING ON THE STREET BUT THEY'RE NOT ALL DYING FOR LACK OF MEDICAL TREATMENT SOME OF THEM ARE DYING FOR BASIC EXPOSURE TO THE ELEMENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH HOUSING PEOPLE COMMENT TO ME ALL THE TIME THAT THEY SEE MORE. VERY SICK PEOPLE AROUND SACRAMENTO FOR EXAMPLE THAT ARE HOMELESS. BUT THAT'S DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE FACT WHEN THE GOLDEN ONE CENTER WAS BEING BUILT WE CLOSED A COUPLE OF S. ARROWS. THOSE TYPES OF RESIDENTIAL HOTELS ARE A LAST RESORT HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OFTEN USING DRUGS PEOPLE WITH FELONIES. PEOPLE THE HISTORY OF DRUG ADDICTION PEOPLE THAT CAN'T JUST GET ANOTHER PLACE AND WHEN THEY'RE HOUSING CLOSES THEY END UP ON THE STREET. SIMILARLY THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH IS TO PROVIDE THE FULL SERVICE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WITH ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE TARGET POPULATION NEEDS. HAS LEFT TWO AND A HALF BILLION IN UNSPENT FUNDS ON THE TABLE AND THIS IS AFTER THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING REPLACED ALL OF ITS PREDECESSOR FUNDING THE AB TWENTY THIRTY FOUR FUNDING. DESPITE THE LANGUAGE TO SUPPLEMENT AND NOT SUPPLANT THAT FUNDING. FURTHERMORE THE LANGUAGE OF AB NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE PINNING THE DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED TO THE LACK OF MEDICAL TREATMENT ALSO IGNORE CISSUS THE SUPPLY SIDE REALITY THAT WE'RE IN. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN NEARLY ALL OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION HAS BEEN ENTITLED TO AND MOST ARE IN FACT ENROLLED IN MEDICARE. SO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN MEDICAL CARE HOWEVER PROVIDING HAVING A MEDICAL CARD DOES NOT IN AND OF ITSELF GUARANTEE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE RIGHT KIND OF CARE. THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING THE NEED WITH A WRAPAROUND SERVICES THEY NEED THAT WILL ACTUALLY ENABLE THEM TO GET BETTER. ABC NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE DOES NOT ACTUALLY SUPPLY THE FULL SERVICE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THAT WOULD SUPPORT SOMEONE THROUGH SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT OR AND. TO LIVE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS THE SOLUTION PROVIDED IN AB NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE IS INVOLUNTARY DETAINMENT. A SOMEWHAT IRONIC SOLUTION WHEN MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOW EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND ARE DESPERATELY SEEKING A PLACE TO LIVE THE ADEQUATELY MEET SOON NEEDS AND WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD. LOCKING PEOPLE UP ONLY EXACERBATE NOT ALLEVIATE THE RESOURCE PROBLEM THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND WE DON'T HAVE TO SERVICES TO PROVIDE TO THEM. ONCE THEY ARE LOCKED UP AYE IN THE CURRENT SITUATION THAT WE HAVE IF WE WERE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE SAID WE HAVE BUILT ALL OUR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WE HAVE BEDS THAT ARE OPEN WE HAVE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THIS PROBLEM. THEN WE MIGHT WANT TO GO LOOKING AT LPS AGAIN BUT UNTIL THAT TIME WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. COULD JUST IN FAIRNESS I WE HAD WE ALLOWED. TWO MINUTES FOR EACH WITNESS BEFORE. THAT WENT PAST THAT DATE WITH THAT GUY GROUP TOOK TEN MINUTES TOTAL WERE IN SEVEN MINUTES NOW WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES. AND THREE MINUTES SO. PLEASE. JOURNAL BE VERY BRIEF KEVIN BACON FOR THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE. ARE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE. IN ONLY THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. BECAUSE I NEED TO GET A LITTLE BIT LEGALLY ON YOU. REALLY TALKING ABOUT POLICY ISSUES HERE BUT THERE ARE ALSO IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN IN THIS BILL IS DETAINING AND CONFINING PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG AND DON'T MEET THE STANDARD FOR DANGER THEMSELVES. TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS SO. THERE IS A VERY DIFFICULT IN HIGH STANDARD FOR THE GOVERNMENT ALUM TO JUSTIFY THAT KIND OF. INTERVENTION AND AND THAT IS THAT IT MUST BE A COMPELLING GOVERNMENTAL RECENT AND THAT THERE CAN'T BE LESS. INTRUSIVE ALTERNATIVES. ALLEN SO I. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND I'M SORRY THAT THE BILL I'M WITHOUT ALSO SENT TO. THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BECAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY THE PLACE TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION BUT THERE ARE IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES. THAT WE REALLY CONSTRUED RAIN WHATEVER. ACTION LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO TAKE IN THIS AREA ARM AND THOSE SUFFICIENTLY COMPELLING GOVERNMENTAL REASONS ARE NOT. SATISFIED BY. EVEN A HUMANE IMPULSE OR DESIRE NOT TO SEE BUT ON THE STREETS. AND MY NAME IS RANDY HICKS. CALIFORNIA'S FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS BUT I'M NOT SPEAKING OF CD ARE TODAY MUCH WE CAN AS A CLIENT. I BELIEVE THIS GOES TOO FAR FOR HELPING CLIENTS. WHAT I BELIEVE NOW IS SET? IF I WAS SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL. AND I WAS LIVING ON THE STREETS I HAVE THE FEELING THAT I WOULD BE LOCKED AWAY IN A JAIL SOMEWHERE. I'M NOT GETTING THE HELP THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING THIS DREAMY DISCLOSE A BRIDGE TOO FAR. NOTED THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. I'M ON MEDICINE NOW I'M ON PROZAC IT WORKS FOR ME BUT IT DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYBODY AND PEOPLE DON'T. DE MISDIAGNOSIS THINGS. I BEEN THERE. AND I UNDERSTAND OUT. AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME IS THE GAME IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND I HAD TERRIBLE SEVERE REACTIONS TO IT. AND THEN THEY WOULD GO AND INEVITABLY GO BACK. SELECT QUESTION REALLY IS IS THIS REALLY ABOUT. PUBLIC SAFETY. AND NOT ABOUT HOUSING. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THOSE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS AND MARK BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THEM ANYMORE. OR JUST REALLY ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE AND IF HE AND AS THE GUY FROM THE SEAL YOU SAID HE HAD TO PUT POINT ABOUT HOUSING. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING. THIS IS AGAIN TAKING AWAY ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE A HOME TO LIVE IN. AND. AND IF WE REALLY WANT TO FIX TREATMENT WE SHOULD REALLY FIX THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IT'S A MESS IS IT IS NOW. PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING WHAT THEY NEED BECAUSE THE FACT IS DATA CAN'T AFFORD IT. OR I KNOW I WANT TO COUNTY. AND I STARTED ON GENERAL ASSISTANCE BEFORE I WAS WITH MENTAL DID I THINK WE FOR MENTAL HEALTH. DID DIAGNOSIS IF I CAN GO TO WORK. DID I THINGS WERE TREATMENT. DOT CAME MUCH MUCH LATER I HAD TO DO THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE THE SELF ADVOCATES CHUBBY THINGS HAPPEN WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE FAMILY MERGE GONZALEZ WHAT WE'RE GOOD WE'RE DOING WRONG. JUST DAYTONA'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WRONG. AND THIS BILL HERE THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR. TOO FAR FOR A QUITE LIKE ME. AND I BOTH. THANK. YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. KIMBERLY SHOUT THE CALIFORNIA PEN AT THE CULT THAT WORK IN OFFICES. MISTER CHAIR A MEMBER I'M. IN ONE OF THOSE IN BETWEEN CATEGORIES HERE NOT SUPPORTING OR OPPOSING. TRANSMIT ON BEHALF OF THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS. PUBLIC CONSERVATISM PUBLIC GUARDIANS AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SPONSORS WE FIND OURSELVES. KIND OF AGREEING WITH BOTH SIDES HERE. FROM A CAUTIONARY NOTE WE ARE THE PEOPLE PUBLIC CONSERVATORY THAT IF THIS BILL PASSES. THE PUBLIC CONSERVE OUR WILL BE THE ONE WHO TAKES. THESE CASES ON AND THE CAUTIONARY NOTE IS THAT IN MOST COUNTIES WE ARE NOT FUNDED BY COUNTY ONLY RESOURCES WELL ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF THE CASELOAD WE HAVE NOW. AND IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS. WE'LL DO OUR BEST BUT WERE ALREADY IN A TRIAGE MODE WITH THE CURRENT CASELOAD AND SO WITHOUT SOME EXTRA FUNDING TO HELP US. I TAKE ON MORE CASES IT'S ARE WE JUST HAD TO TELL PEOPLE BUT THIS PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO BE THE SOLUTION TO CARE THAT WE ALL HOPE FOR. THE OTHER BIGGER ISSUE AS ONCE WE GET PEOPLE INTO A CONSERVATORSHIP. OUR CLIENT OR OUR MEMBERS ARE NOT ABLE TO FIND PLACES TO PUT THESE PEOPLE THERE JUST AREN'T THE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AVAILABLE. AND SO AGAIN IF YOU CONSERVE AMIDST DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE THAT FOR A FACT THAT THAT THE TREATMENT THAT WE ALL HOPE THEY DO SO. JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE A CAUTIONARY NOTE FOR EVERYONE AS YOU DECIDE ON THIS BILL. DURING MUCH. ANYONE ELSE. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS. MISTER MISTER RODRIGUEZ. I DON'T THINK THE AUTHORS FOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. SUCH ONE EQUIVOCATION SO. THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY YOU TALK ABOUT BEING GRAVELY DISABLED SO THIS IS GOING TO ADD LANGUAGE THAT. IF BY CHANCE YOU FIND SOMEONE THAT. IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE CARE FOR THEMSELVES THAT THEY WOULD BE ON FIFTY ONE FIFTY OR WAKES ABANDONMENT TO ADD. WHAT WHEEL WE WOULDN'T DO THAT MUCH IF I MAY WHAT WE WOULD DO IS ADD TO THE DEFINITION OF GRAVELY DISABLED? THE SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE MEDICAL NEED TO THAT'S RIGHT NOW IT'S CLOTHING BUT. HOUSING THEMSELVES. GLASS WHICH GIVES ME BUT WE WERE AND MEDICAL NEED TO IT AS WELL. YEAH WE'RE JUST CHARACTERS BECAUSE OVERSEE. DEALING WITHA LOT OF THEME FOLKS ARMS ON THE FIFTY ONE FIFTIES AND THEN. OFFICES THAT WAS ALWAYS ISSUE IF YOU'RE GRAVELY DISABLED IF YOU WANT A LOT KNOWING IT DIDN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE SO TO SPEAK. THEY PUT YOU ON THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY TO GET MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ARMED SOLDIERS WANTED HER FINE ADDING THIS OTHER LANGUAGE TO INCLUDE THESE OTHER INDIVIDUALS. FOR MY NEXT QUESTION TWO IS I DON'T SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD ON ONE OF SEVEN SEVENTY TWO HOURS EVEN. LONG ENOUGH MAYBE X. ANOTHER TWENTY FOUR HOURS NINETY SIX HOURS TO PROVIDE MORE CARE FOR THESE FOLKS BECAUSE. EVERYBODY'S DIFFERENT RIGHT IN AND MAYBE THREE DAYS MAY NOT BE GOOD BUT I GUESS THEY CAN RE DO THAT BUT I JUST WANTED A. SIMPLIFICATION ON THAT I SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THAT. IN THE ASSEMBLY HAS JUST TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE BET SERVICES I MEAN HOW DO WE. SYSTEM IS KIND OF ALREADY OVERBURDENED CELS BICU AT MORE INTERNAL WOULD. MEAN THAT YOU NEED TO ADD MORE FOR THAT JUST CLONE THIS PARTICULAR BILL WILL IT WORK JUST WERE DRESSING ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE I MEAN I'LL REMIND YOU THAT THE LEGISLATURE. HAS TAKEN. HAS TAKING. ACTION LAST YEAR WILL BE DUE TO NO PLACE LIKE HOME GRANTED IT'S. IT'S IN THAT OCCASION BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT OUR STATE BUDGET IN SOME OF THE THAT WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR CERTAINLY FUND. OF THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND. IN LA COUNTY. ALSO REMIND YOU ONE PARTICULAR COUNTY BUT OTHERS CAN DO THE SAME THING WE'VE PASS HHH WHICH IS GOING TO FUND. SOME OF THESE WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES. LIKEWISE A CITY IT DOESN'T COVER YOUR AREA BUT. SEE OF LOS ANGELES DID A EACH. AND WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF A THE BUDGET ASK AND REQUEST I THAT COULD AUGMENT THIS I MEAN THERE'S NO DOUBT I'M NOT ARGUING THAT THERE'S A NEED OF OF. HOUSING ABSOLUTELY THINK THIS LEGISLATORS RECOGNIZED IT I THINK. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF CARRY TWO THREE HOUSING BILLS A YEAR AND CAT AND IN FACT LAST YEAR WE VOTED TO PUT SOMETHING. AND IN THE. NOVEMBER. NOVEMBER ELECTIONS OF THE VOTERS CAN DECIDE TO DO THIS I THINK WE'VE ADDRESSED SOME OF THOSE ISSUES OF THIS BILL IS VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED JUST ON THE DEFINITION OF GRAVELY GRAVELY DISABLED. OOPS. S. RECORDED THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ON. I SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND. I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING AFFORD I REALIZE IT'S AN. UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATION THIS IS NOT AN EASY THING TO TALK ABOUT I THINK THERE ARE. LEGITIMATE ISSUES THAT COME UP WITH PEOPLE'S. CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. AND. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BUT. I I THINK IT'S IT'S NEEDED AND CAN THIS DAY AND AGE I I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT. IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED A SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS. THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL ARE HOMELESS OR PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS MOMENTS WE ARE BUT BY NO MEANS. IS THIS IS THIS THAT THAT'S A SOLUTION BUT SO I'M. YOU KNOW THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS WHO DON'T QUALIFY AS MISTER RODRIGUEZ SAID FOR. FIFTY ONE FIFTY WHO I'M TO. DATE THEY DON'T. QUALIFY. EITHER BECAUSE THEY DON'T MEET THE THRESHOLD OF THE COUNTY FOR THE LORD'S LA OR LOWERS LA MY SENDING IS IN EVERY COUNTY CORRECT. TO HAVE A DAHLE IMPLEMENT IT ON I I KNOW THAT LAURA I KNOW HER FAMILY. SHE WAS THAT AMAZING NINETEEN YEAR OLD WOMAN HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. WAS KILLED TRAGICALLY BY DERANGED INDIVIDUAL HER PARENTS NAKED AMANDA WILCOX ARTICLES SAYING THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS WORKING ON GUN VIOLENCE ISSUES. AND DOWN YOU KNOW WE WE WE TRIED TO TO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH THIS BUT WITH WITH THAT LAURA'S LA BUT IT'S IT'S IT HASN'T GONE FAR ENOUGH AND. YOU CAN WALK OUTSIDE OF OUR STATE CAPITOL FOR TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES AND. AND YOU CAN SEE INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T QUITE. QUALIFY MEET THE THRESHOLD A FIFTY ONE FIFTY BUT AS WE HEARD FROM. PERFORMERS SACRAMENTO POLICE OFFICER WHO DID A PHENOMENAL JOB MICHELLE. WAS OUR CAT HERE TESTIFIED EARLIER. THEY'RE THEY'RE INDIVIDUALS WHO. YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO HELP THEY CAN'T THEY'RE NOT QUITE HELPING THEMSELVES BUT THEY DON'T QUITE. MEET THAT THRESHOLD OF VIOLENCE TO SOMEBODY ELSE FOR THEMSELVES. AND. I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER. I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE OFFERING. IS A. THIS IS IS THIS THAT A PILOT OPPORTUNITY HERE IS A SUNSET. BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS THAT I'D DRAMATIC CHAT DRAMATIC CHANGE FROM. THE LAND TO MEANT POLICY YOU KNOW THE LATE SIXTIES SO I DO THINK THERE ARE. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES WITH WHICH WE'VE HEARD FROM FROM THE OPPONENTS BUT. I THINK THAT IT. IT IT IS NEEDED AND THAT WOULD WORK TO TO HELP DEAL WITH OUR ISSUES TO GET PEOPLE. THE HELP THAT THEY NEED THE HELP THAT THEY DESERVES HELP THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING FOR WHATEVER REASON HELP THAT OUR COMMUNITY WANTS THEM TO GET THE WE CAN'T PROVIDE. THANK YOU. YOU WANNA RESPOND IN THIS MANNER. CORRECT. LOOK CLOSER CHECK MADE TO BE CHANGED IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE FEELS THAT HE NEEDS TO CHANGE DOWN THE LINE THEY CAN. I MEAN IN FACT IF IF IF THIS DOESN'T WORK I CAN IMAGINE MYSELF BEING BACK IN HAVING A DIFFERENT SORT OF CONVERSATION TIGHTENING OR LOOSENING UP I MEAN THIS IS WHAT WE DO. BUT BUT IN NINE TO REALIZE THAT THIS IS A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATION WAS UNCOMFORTABLE FOR ME TO APPROACH IT. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF YOU WALK DOWN MOST HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS. A PARTICULAR THAT'S THE CASE IN MY DISTRICT. YOU HAVE CLOSE TO TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING ON THE STREETS. YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT A GOOD PERCENTAGE OR SOME PERCENTAGE OF THEM. HAVE SEVERE MEDICAL NEEDS. AND. I MEAN. THAT'S THE HUMANE THING TO DO. I KNOW I WALK DOWN THE STREET SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE THAT INDIVIDUAL SCRATCH THEMSELVES WITH WITH THIS DASH. HOLES IN THEIR SKIN. TOLD THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY'D BEEN RUBBED AGAINST THE GROUND WITH NOTHING LEFT IN. I REALIZE IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATION BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY INHUMANE TO IGNORE THAT PERSON WHO YOU CAN GIVE SOME SORT OF MEDICAL SERVICE TO. AND AND THIS REALLY STAND UP FOR THE. FROM A STORY THAT I HAVE BEEN IN THE DISTRICT OF A WOMAN WHO I HONORED. AS AS WOMAN OF THE YEAR WHO REALLY BEGIN THIS CONVERSATION WITH US A YEARS AGO I'M. JOINTAUTHORS HAVE THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES IT LET THEM THE TO THE SAME PATH BUT IT WAS ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL WHO STOOD UP IN FRONT OF BUSINESS. AND SOME A HIM THIS HAD TO GO AGAINST THE WALL AND UNTIL IT BLEEDS IN PERSON JUST LAYS ON THE STUFF YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. AND THOSE A CONSERVATORSHIP. BATTLE IN THAT AREA. A REGARDING THIS BUT WHEN WE TOOK A LOOK AT THIS WERE CERTAINLY NOT TAKE WERE NOT TAKEN THE APPROACH. TO REMOVE CIVIL LIBERTIES FROM EVERY ANYBODY WHO'S DISABLED BUT WHAT WHEN WE TOOK THE STEP. PATH WE WANTED TO PROVIDE MEDICAL SERVICES. I TO FROM THE SOMEBODY WHO. NEEDS IT. AND AGAIN I WOULD SAY JUST THE IN HUMANE THING TO JUST KEEP WALKING DOWN THE STREET WHEN WE KNOW WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. HOUSE. JUST QUICKLY NO WORKING TOWARDS IN OF THE DAY. THIS IS A FANTASTIC BILL WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AND DO THIS AND NOW IT'S BEEN TRIED BEFORE. AND IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT AND THE LISTENER TO COMMISSION STOCK NAM AND THE STORY. OF MY HAVE. IF FAMILY MEMBERS. WHOSE. GONE THROUGH THAT EXACT SAME THING AND IT IS SO DEVASTATING AND TO BE ABLE TO WATCH. YEAH WE TALK A LOT ABOUT A READ A LOT OF GOOD AROUND HERE ABOUT JUSTICE IN. AND WE TALK ABOUT LIBERTY AND I LOVE LIBERTY AND WANT MORE OF IT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S LIBERTY. OF FROM THEM BUT I ALSO THINK ABOUT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE ARE OUR BROTHER'S KEEPER. AND THERE ARE THOSE INSTANCES IN WHICH SOMEBODY NEEDS HELP AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HELPING FOLKS SO THANK YOU FOR THE COURAGE TO COME FORWARD. ABOUT SUPPORTING THE SAID TODAY.
