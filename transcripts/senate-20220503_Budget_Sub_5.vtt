NEWMAN- YOU'RE ON IT IT'S

00:23:52.964 --> 00:23:55.200
PROBABLY A QUESTION FOR MR LEAP.

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:55.867
TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE WE'RE

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:58.537
WE'RE CONSIDERING- ANOTHER ONE

00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:01.473
TIME ALLOCATION FOR THIS YEAR'S

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.808
BUDGET- AGAINST LAST YEAR'S

00:24:02.874 --> 00:24:04.042
WINTER BUDGET SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:05.110
FROM DISCUSSION HERE THAT THESE

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:08.146
ARE ONGOING NEEDS- IT'D THE

00:24:08.213 --> 00:24:09.047
ANNOUNCES WE GOT ALSO NOTES

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:10.615
THERE WERE SOME HARPER FUNDS

00:24:10.682 --> 00:24:12.684
THAT WERE- PROVIDING ON A ON A

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:15.053
THREE YEAR BASIS SO AS FOR

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:15.921
FURTHER QUESTIONS WHAT WHAT'S

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:19.157
LEFT. FOR THIS YEAR AND I SEEM

00:24:19.224 --> 00:24:21.259
NEXT YEAR OF THE ORP OF FUNDS.

00:24:21.326 --> 00:24:24.062
AND WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF THE

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:28.800
ONGOING NEED- IN RESPONSE TO THE

00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:31.670
FIRST QUESTION- SO FROM THE

00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:33.371
FEDERAL OUR CURRENT CURRENT MY

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:36.508
WRISTS FISCAL RELIEF FUNDS- IT

00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:39.044
WAS SPREAD ACROSS THREE YEARS.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.712
SO THERE WAS ABOUT FORTY MILLION

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:43.548
IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO.

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:45.150
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THERE'S

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:47.152
TWENTY MILLION AND THEN IN

00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:47.786
TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:49.020
THERE IS THE FINAL TWENTY

00:24:49.087 --> 00:24:51.523
MILLION AND SO THEN THAT MONEY.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.391
WILL BE GONE- AS AS AS- AS YOU

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:55.694
REFERENCED- SO IT'S HELPFUL

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.797
AGAIN SO IN TWENTY TWENTY TO

00:24:58.864 --> 00:25:02.934
TWENTY THREE WHAT IS CURRENTLY.

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:04.870
IN AN ONGOING IN COMBINATION

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:06.872
FROM THE GENERAL FUND AS WELL AS

00:25:06.938 --> 00:25:08.473
FROM CIVIL FILING FEES AND THEN

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.275
THAT TWENTY MILLION AND FEDERAL

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:12.077
DOLLARS THAT'S KIND OF WHAT'S

00:25:12.143 --> 00:25:13.812
THERE. AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:15.947
SO IT TOOK THAT IT SOUNDS AS IF

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:17.349
WERE- CERTAIN POSITION PLUS MAKE

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:18.717
ANOTHER ONE TIME ALLOCATION

00:25:18.783 --> 00:25:20.518
AGAINST THE NEED THIS YEAR-

00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:22.621
WHICH IS PROBABLY A GOOD THING

00:25:22.687 --> 00:25:24.489
BUT YOU KNOW I DO GET CONCERNED.

00:25:24.556 --> 00:25:26.791
CECI LOOKING OUT AT THE END OF

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:27.726
THE FISCAL ENVIRONMENT AND NOW

00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:29.060
YEARS IN THE ABSENCE OF A

00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:30.862
SURPLUS WE'RE GONNA MAKE SOME.

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:33.698
DIFFICULT CHOICES- SHOWED EACH

00:25:33.765 --> 00:25:36.534
SHOULD THIS BE A LARGER ON GOING

00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:38.503
ALLOCATION MOVING FORWARD OR IS

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.105
THERE A SENSE THAT THE NEED WILL

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:42.574
DECREASE AS THE EFFECTS OF A

00:25:42.641 --> 00:25:46.578
PANDEMIC- START TO. SUBSIDE THE

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:49.147
LEGISLATURE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN-

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:51.216
EVALUATING IT AS PART OF YOUR

00:25:51.283 --> 00:25:52.517
BROADER. GENERAL FUND

00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:54.786
PRIORITIES- SO TO GIVE YOU AN

00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:59.557
EXAMPLE- IN. BETWEEN TWENTY

00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:00.859
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT TWENTY ONE

00:26:00.926 --> 00:26:03.495
TWENTY TWO. THERE WAS AN

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:04.262
AUGMENTATION- THAT WAS INCLUDED

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:06.197
IN THE BUDGET TWENTY MILLION OF

00:26:06.264 --> 00:26:07.999
THAT WAS ON GOING THIRTY MILLION

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:11.136
OF THAT. WAS ONE TIME- THAT'S

00:26:11.202 --> 00:26:12.037
ACTUALLY NOT MS COPELAND

00:26:12.103 --> 00:26:13.505
ACTUALLY MENTIONED THAT THAT'S

00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:15.807
THIRTY MILLION. A ONE TIME AND

00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:18.176
SO THE TWENTY MILLION ONGOING-

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:20.512
IS EFFECTIVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:21.880
TWENTY TWO AND WILL CONTINUE ON

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:23.181
THE LEGISLATURE IF IT IS A

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.049
PRIORITY CERTAINLY CAN ADD

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:25.617
ADDITIONAL PLANS WHETHER IT BE

00:26:25.684 --> 00:26:28.687
ON A LIMITED TERM OR AN ON GOING

00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:30.221
BASIS. AND JUST TO CLOSE THIS

00:26:30.288 --> 00:26:32.190
OUT I GUESS FROM MS COPELAND

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:33.725
NINETY WHAT'S YOUR SENSES OF HOW

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:35.860
FAR WILL THAT. ONGOING

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:38.563
ALLOCATION MAKE US IN AN INSTANT

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.397
PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE

00:26:39.464 --> 00:26:41.533
CONSIDERING. A LARGER ALLOCATION

00:26:41.599 --> 00:26:43.868
WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED ON ON

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:45.070
GOING BASIS. I MEAN FOR THE

00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:46.705
LEGAL AID PROGRAMS IN YOUR

00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:47.238
DISTRICT WOULD APPRECIATE

00:26:47.305 --> 00:26:48.673
ONGOING ALLOCATION BUT I KNOW

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.642
THE REALITY OF THE PROJECT THAT

00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:52.110
ONE TIME ALLOCATIONS ARE EASIER

00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:53.912
TO MANAGE AND THAT- WHAT'S

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:55.046
REALLY IMPORTANT LEGAL AID

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:56.748
ORGANIZATIONS TO BE ABLE TO

00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:58.149
HIRE. INTO HIGHER STAFF

00:26:58.216 --> 00:26:59.884
ATTORNEYS AND OTHER ADVOCATES

00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:01.052
FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS RATHER

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:03.788
THAN TEMPORARY HIRES IS MULTI

00:27:03.855 --> 00:27:05.890
YEAR FUNDING. ON GO ON GOING

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.759
FUNDING IS IDEAL OF COURSE THAT

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:08.994
MULTI YEAR ONE TIME FUNDING IS

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.662
ALSO COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE

00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:12.263
BECAUSE ORGANIZATIONS CAN HIRE.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.165
I'M IN THERE IS A WRINKLE THAT I

00:27:14.232 --> 00:27:15.633
THINK MAY HAVE BEEN MENTIONED-

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.268
LAST YEAR WE DISCUSSED THIS AND

00:27:17.335 --> 00:27:19.604
I THINK IT MAY ALSO BE MADE

00:27:19.671 --> 00:27:21.473
ALISTAIR. IS I ALSO. COUNT HAVE

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:24.909
A SIGNIFICANT DROP. AVENUE AS

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:27.479
SOON AS THAT THAT KIND OF OUR

00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:28.046
SKIN A CAT IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:27:28.113 --> 00:27:28.947
BECAUSE INTEREST RATES DROP SO

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:30.715
MUCH RESIDE DECREASE OF I THINK

00:27:30.782 --> 00:27:32.617
APPROXIMATELY APPROXIMATELY

00:27:32.684 --> 00:27:33.985
TWENTY MILLION PER YEAR. IN

00:27:34.052 --> 00:27:35.687
REVENUE AND THAT MONEY WENT

00:27:35.754 --> 00:27:37.055
DIRECTLY TO LEGAL AID PROGRAMS

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:38.656
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND AS

00:27:38.723 --> 00:27:40.058
INTEREST RATES IMPROVE WE WILL

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:41.359
SEE THAT THAT AMOUNT SLOWLY

00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:43.094
INCREASING AGAIN. IT'S JUST

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:45.130
GONNA BE QUITE A WHILE AND SO I

00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:46.031
DON'T INTEREST RATES IMPROVE

00:27:46.097 --> 00:27:48.433
ENOUGH THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.301
PRIOR- REVENUE I BELIEVE WE HAD

00:27:50.368 --> 00:27:50.869
ROUGHLY FIFTEEN MILLION IN

00:27:50.935 --> 00:27:57.709

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.422
DISPROPORTIONATELY FOCUS THE

PROPONENTS TO CONTINUE TO LOOK

00:30:50.748 --> 00:30:51.983
AT THAT KIND OF AN APPROACH

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.651
WHERE YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN'T

00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:36.059
CONCERN ABOUT HAVING A STATE

00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:38.929
WIDE RECOUNTING WHY. INDEX

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:40.264
HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.999
THAT THE MORE POPULATED COUNTIES

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:43.934
TO ACCOUNT FOR MORE REVENUE FOR

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:45.068
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND FOR THE

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:47.237
COURTS. AND THEY HAVE HIGHER

00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:48.572
LEVELS OF POVERTY THEY HAVE

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.707
HIGHER POPULATIONS MORE PEOPLE

00:46:50.774 --> 00:46:52.910
WILL SEEK THE COURTS AND HAVE

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:53.977
THEIR DAY IN COURT IN THOSE

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:56.513
COUNTIES. SO WE NEED TO REFLECT

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.182
THE INCOME SKINNER THAT REFLECTS

00:46:58.248 --> 00:46:59.650
THE INCOME OF CALIFORNIA THE

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:01.785
HIGH COST OF LIVING. WE DO HAVE

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:03.220
PROPOSALS UNDER THE FEDERAL

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:04.922
POVERTY GUIDELINES. BUT WE

00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:06.557
BELIEVE THAT USING THE STATE

00:47:06.623 --> 00:47:08.458
MEDIAN INCOME AS A STANDARD IS

00:47:08.525 --> 00:47:09.226
MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE

00:47:09.293 --> 00:47:11.161
COMMUNITIES AND THE COST OF

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:12.029
LIVING HERE WHICH IS WHY I

00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:13.797
RESPECTFULLY. REQUESTING THE

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:16.166
ENHANCEMENT BACK LEVEL BECAUSE

00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:18.101
THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR. THE HIGH

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:20.437
COST OF LIVING AND GET MORE OF

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:22.005
THE POPULATION THAT WE BELIEVE

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:26.944
WILL ACCESS THE COURTS. SO I

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.111
HOPE THAT ADDRESSES YOUR

00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:29.947

00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:45.722
SENATOR NEWMAN'S- ISSUE THAT HE

00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:47.991
HAS RAISED ABOUT THE

00:58:48.057 --> 00:58:51.060
RECRUITMENT- YOU MENTIONED THE

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:55.398
VARIOUS WAYS- IS THERE A-

00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:59.302
SHORTAGE OF COSTS OF. POTENTIAL

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:02.972
CAUSES OF HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS

00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:05.508
THAT IF THERE IS AND IF WITH

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:08.578
THIS- INCREASE- YOU'RE

00:59:08.645 --> 00:59:10.546
EXPECTING- OF COURSE SEVERAL

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:13.516
THOUSAND MORE OF VOLUNTEERS A

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:16.119
MORE ADVOCATES HOW WOULD YOU

00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:20.757
RECRUITMENT. RECRUITMENT IS A

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:22.692
HUGE ISSUE FOR US BECAUE NOT

00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:24.227
MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE COURT

00:59:24.294 --> 00:59:24.794
APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:26.896
PROGRAM AT ONCE PEOPLE LEARN

00:59:26.963 --> 00:59:28.698
ABOUT IT THEY GET VERY EXCITED

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:29.966
BUT ONE OF THE BARRIERS THAT WE

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:31.834
HAVE IS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:33.303
CHILDREN IN A CONFIDENTIAL

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:35.471
CLOSED COURT SYSTEM SO WE CAN'T

00:59:35.538 --> 00:59:37.473
ACTUALLY SHOW THE CHILDREN OR

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:38.942
TELL THOSE STORIES WHEN USING

00:59:39.008 --> 00:59:40.576
THEIR TRUE NAMES. SO IT'S A

00:59:40.643 --> 00:59:42.612
SYSTEM THAT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:59:42.679 --> 00:59:45.648
KNOW ABOUT- RECENTLY WE DID A

00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:47.884
PSA PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:49.986
WITH A FORMER SURGEON GENERAL DR

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:53.556
NADINE BURKE HARRIS I AND WE I

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:54.958
PLAYED THAT ALL OVER CALIFORNIAN

00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:56.059
IT REALLY DID BRING IN

00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:57.961
VOLUNTEERS SO OUR STRATEGY

00:59:58.027 --> 01:00:00.463
REALLY IS TO. INCREASE THE

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:01.898
VISIBILITY OF THE LOCAL CASA

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:04.467
PROGRAMS DO STATEWIDE MARKETING

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:08.237
BOTH IN PRINT RADIO AND TV SO

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:09.238
THAT WE CAN REALLY RAISE OUR

01:00:09.305 --> 01:00:11.240
VISIBILITY AND WE WERE ABLE TO

01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:13.876
DO IT IN SAN DIEGO AT SAN

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:15.411
DIEGO'S PROGRAM IS NOW SERVING

01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:16.813
THE MAJORITY THEIR CHILDREN. BUT

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:18.915
IT JUST TAKES HARD WORK AND IT

01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:20.016
DOES TAKE AN INVESTMENT IN

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:21.184
MARKETING WHICH IS WHERE THE

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.219
STATE WOULD PUT- MANY MORE

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:24.754
DOLLARS WE'VE NEVER HAD THE

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:27.023
RESOURCES TO DO A STATEWIDE

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.092
CAMPAIGN OF THE NATURE THAT

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:31.194
WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND YES AND IT

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.596
SENATOR RAND THERE IS A SHORTAGE

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:35.598
OF PROCESS. ON BECAUSE DON'T I

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.200
THINK THE PUBLIC DOESN'T

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:38.668
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY CAN DO TO

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.170
HELP FAMILIES AND SO IT WOULD BE

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:43.840
A HUGE MEDIA BLITZ OVER THE NEXT

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:45.875
SEVERAL YEARS I WITH A TARGETED

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:47.543
STRATEGY BE. TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.545
WE'RE HELPING MORE CHILDREN AND

THAT INDICATED THAT THERE HAS

01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:06.923
BEEN A GROWTH. IN HOMICIDE

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:08.925
FIREARM DEATHS AS WELL AS AN

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.093
INCREASE IN THE SHARE OF

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:12.528
HOMICIDES AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:14.163
AND ROBBERIES THAT HAVE INVOLVED

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:17.200
FIREARMS. ADDITIONALLY AS OF

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:19.368
JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR THERE

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:21.838
WERE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:22.705
FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ON THE

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:24.107
STATE'S ARMED AND PROHIBITED

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:26.075
PERSONS LAST. THESE ARE

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:27.743
INDIVIDUALS WHO SUBSEQUENTLY

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:29.178
BECOME PROHIBITED FROM

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.646
POSSESSING FIREARMS AND

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:32.748
AMMUNITION THAT THEY HAD

01:02:32.815 --> 01:02:34.350
PURCHASED LEGALLY BEFORE.

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:36.552
BECAUSE THEY WERE CONVICTED OF

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:38.287
FELONIES AND SOME MISDEMEANOR.

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.790
FOUND BY A COURT TO BE A DANGER

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:42.225
TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS DUE TO

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:43.126
MENTAL ILLNESS OR HAVE A

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:46.762
RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST THEM.

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:48.364
AS PART OF OUR ANALYSIS WE DID

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.699
HIGHLIGHT TWO OPTIONS FOR

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:52.034
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IF THE

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:54.604
LEGISLATURE WAS INTERESTED IN-

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.139
KIND OF TARGETING FIREARM

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:57.874
RELATED I'M PUBLIC SAFETY CALLS

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.175
AND BOTH OF THOSE ARE REFLECTED

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:02.278
IN YOUR AGENDA. AND SO ONE- WAS

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:04.013
TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.581
DOJ'S GUN VIOLENCE REDUCTION

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:07.984
PROGRAM FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.652
TO FURTHER REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:11.187
ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSONS ON

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.689
THE STATE LAST. AND ALSO TO-

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:15.725
EXPAND TO POTENTIALLY EXPAND THE

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:17.160
LANGUAGE THAT OTHER ONE FORSMAN

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:20.429
AGENCIES BEYOND TO THE SHERIFF'S

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:21.531
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE

01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:23.199
GRANTS. THE OTHER OPTION THAT WE

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:25.635
PROVIDED WAS RELATED TO REMOVING

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:27.370
FIREARMS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHEN

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:28.671
THEY BECOME PROHIBITED AND THIS

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:30.806
IS SORT OF IN LINE WITH WHAT THE

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:33.142
SENATE IS CONSIDERING AS PART OF

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:34.544
THIS- ISSUE. THIS IS A QUICKLY

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:36.212
BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:37.280
EIGHTEEN INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:38.314
SUPPOSED TO RELINQUISH THEIR

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:39.615
FIREARMS AT THE TIME OF THEIR

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:42.418
CONVICTION FOR A FELONY OR

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:43.286
CERTAIN MISDEMEANORS. AND SO WE

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:45.454
OPTION THAT WE PROVIDED WAS THAT

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:46.689
PROVIDING FUNDING TO LOCAL LAW

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:47.890
ENFORCEMENT FOR PROBATION

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:49.926
DEPARTMENTS TO INSURE THAT THAT

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:51.527
WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND THEY

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:52.929
WERE BEING SURRENDERED COULD BE

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:55.298
EFFECTIVE- AT LIMITING THE

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:57.200
GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF ARMED

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:58.935

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:42.778
BECAUSE OF THIS I KNOW HOW

01:04:42.845 --> 01:04:44.981
CRITICAL IT IS THAT WE FUNDED

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:46.816
PROGRAMS TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:48.951
WHO ARE PROHIBITED. FROM HAVING

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:51.721
FIREARMS ARE ACTUALLY SEPARATED

01:04:51.787 --> 01:04:53.723
FROM THOSE FIREARMS AS CLOSE TO

01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:55.258
THE TIME OF PROHIBITION IS

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:58.227
POSSIBLE. THERE ARE SO MANY

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:00.229
TRAGEDIES ON MY MIND TODAY.

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.798
ADULTS CHILDREN POLICE OFFICERS

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:04.667
COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHOSE LIVES

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:05.801
HAVE BEEN SHATTERED BY GUN

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:08.271
VIOLENCE. AND SPECIFICALLY BY

01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:10.406
THOSE WHO REMAIN IN POSSESSION

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:13.242
OF FIREARMS. DESPITE BEING

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:14.877
PROHIBITED. LAST YEAR ROBERT

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:17.146
LEWIS AT CALMATTERS REVEALED THE

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:18.648
EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM WHEN HE

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:21.150
COVERED THE STORY OF KELLY GRAY

01:05:21.217 --> 01:05:23.619
A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD MOTHER OF

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:24.587
THREE WHO SOUGHT PROTECTION FROM

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.389
HER ABUSIVE HUSBAND. BY

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:28.190
REQUESTING A RESTRAINING ORDER

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.393
AGAINST HIM IN TWENTY TWENTY IN

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:32.595
MADERA. HE TOLD HER A

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:34.330
RESTRAINING ORDER WAS NOTHING

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:36.599
MORE THAN A PIECE OF PAPER AND

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:38.801
WOULDN'T KEEP HIM AWAY. KELLY

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:40.736

POSSESSES GUNS FIREARMS OR

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:56.052
AMMUNITION. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.787
THE PRESENCE OF A FIREARM IN A

01:05:57.853 --> 01:06:00.356
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE MAKES IT

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:02.058
FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAT A

01:06:02.124 --> 01:06:03.793
VICTIM WILL BE KILLED. SHE ALSO

01:06:03.859 --> 01:06:05.828

AT HER OUTSIDE THEIR SON'S

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:18.607
TO TAKE HER INTO THE ORCHARDS

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:19.842
AND KILL HER. AT THE HEARING THE

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:21.610
JUDGE WHO HAD SAID ON THE RECORD

01:06:21.677 --> 01:06:23.279
THAT HE HAD REVIEWED THE FILING

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:26.449
ASK ONLY ONE QUESTION ABOUT GUNS

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:28.451
. SURE THERE'S NO INFORMATION

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:29.685
THAT YOU HAVE ANY GUNS OR

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:32.521
FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION YOU THINK

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:34.724
YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE. NO HER

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:37.326
HUSBAND REPLIED. THE DELAYS WITH

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:39.261
LAW ENFORCEMENT'S INVESTIGATION

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:40.930
AND AN EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE

01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:42.765
ORDER THAT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:45.267
GUN RELINQUISHMENT TO OR SEIZURE

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:47.403
BY LAW ENFORCEMENT SUGGESTS

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:49.672
THERE WERE MULTIPLE

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:51.407
OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERVENE. BUT

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:53.309
LESS THAN A MONTH AFTER THE

THREE CHILDREN AGES SIX FOUR AND

01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:01.350

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:03.018
CRIMINAL CASES THERE IS A

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:05.054

INVOLVED TO HELP ENSURE FIREARM

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:11.160
RELINQUISHMENT HAPPENS BUT

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:12.661
FAMILY COURTS DON'T HAVE THE

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:15.264
STATE FUNDED RESOURCES SO JUDGES

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:17.133
COURT STAFF AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.034

01:22:57.172 --> 01:23:00.675
THE FOR THE WEDDING WOULD GO

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.377
TOWARDS MORE. BALONNE FORSMAN

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:03.645
PERSONNEL OR MORE PROBATION

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:06.548
PERSONNEL FILE A DIFFERENT

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:07.849
STANDPOINT WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:10.085
FOCUSING ON IS NOT SO MUCH

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:13.121
PROBATION- BUT WHAT I MENTIONED

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:14.656
IN TERMS OF THE EXAMPLE FROM

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:16.725
KING COUNTY SEATTLE WASHINGTON

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:17.959
WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:20.362
APPROACH YOU KNOW- THE FACT THE

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:22.130
PROBATION PLAYS A ROLE IN THE

01:23:22.197 --> 01:23:24.933
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS UNDER PROP

01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:27.302
SIXTY THREE WHERE THEY HAVE TO

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:28.670
ENSURE FIREARM RELINQUISHMENT

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:30.305
HAPPENS AND THEY HAVE TO TELL.

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:32.707
LOCAL WE WILL BE A SIMILAR. IN

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:34.609
CIVIL PROCEEDINGS IN FOR EXAMPLE

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:35.877
THESE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:23:35.944 --> 01:23:38.012
RESTRAINING ORDER PROCEEDINGS SO

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:40.014
SOMETHING LIKE A FIREARMS

01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:42.450
RELINQUISHMENT COORDINATOR WHOSE

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:44.686
JOB IT WOULD BE TO ENSURE THAT

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:46.554
PROTOCOLS ARE IN PLACE. THE

01:23:46.621 --> 01:23:48.490
JUDGES GET THE INFORMATION THEY

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:50.225
NEED THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:51.393
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT ARE

01:23:51.459 --> 01:23:53.328
EXPECTED TO BE PERFORMED UNDER

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:55.864
FAMILY CODE SECTION SIX THREE OH

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:58.366
SIX IN FAMILY LAW DOMESTIC

01:23:58.433 --> 01:23:59.033
VIOLENCE PROCEEDINGS. THAT WOULD

01:23:59.100 --> 01:23:59.768
GET THEIR JOBS BETTER

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:01.669
INFORMATION THEY COULD BE

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:04.305
LOOKING AT CRIMINAL DATABASE

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:05.974
CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS TO

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.076
ENSURE THAT SOMEONE ISN'T REVIEW

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:10.178
NO PROHIBITED IN CRIMINAL. ON

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:11.946
PROBATION AND THAT INFORMATION

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:14.048
ISN'T GIVEN TO THE FAMILY COURT.

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:15.316
WILL BE COORDINATING WITH LAW

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:18.153
ENFORCEMENT SO WE REALLY SEE THE

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:20.789
NEED TO HAVE DEDICATED PERSON IN

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:23.792
EVERY COURT. R. THAT WORKS WITH

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:25.827
LAW ENFORCEMENT PROBATION AND

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.095
THE CIVIL COURTS TO ENSURE

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:28.763
BETTER COORDINATION SO THAT

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:31.366
WOULD BE OUR OUR EMPHASIS OKAY.

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:36.137
OKAY SIR COURTESY. THANK YOU

01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:55.490
SO MUCH HAS BEEN SO MUCH ENERGY

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:56.524
AND LEGISLATION AN EFFORT HAS

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:58.760
BEEN PUT INTO WHAT I WOULD CALL

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.295
THE HARDWARE SIDE OF. OF FIRE

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:04.365
ARMS CONTROL AND- TRYING TO

01:25:04.432 --> 01:25:07.368
DETERMINE WHAT'S SAFER YOU KNOW

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:10.271

GROUPS AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:13.908
THINGS WHEN- THE FACT THE MATTER

01:25:13.975 --> 01:25:16.778
IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE JUST DOING.

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:20.281
AN EXTRAORDINARILY- ANEMIC JOB

01:25:20.348 --> 01:25:21.850
OF GETTING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:23.218
OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO

01:25:23.284 --> 01:25:25.086
HELP ME IN THE FIRST PLACE-

01:25:25.153 --> 01:25:26.855
REGARDLESS OF. REGARDLESS OF

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:29.257
WHAT THE HARDWARE LOOKS LIKE OR

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:33.027
FEELS LIKE- IN IN. IN ALSO I

STATEMENT YOU KNOW THIS APPROACH

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:40.134
RELEASE. STEERS AWAY FROM FOLKS

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:42.203
WHO ARE MORE HEALTHY LAW ABIDING

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:46.007
FIREARMS OWNERS WHO WHO AREN'T-

WE'VE BEEN DESCRIBING SYSTEMS

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:49.611
THAT WE'VE BEEN DESCRIBING ALL

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:52.547
ALONG SO. GREAT THE COUPLE JUST

01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:56.217
A COUPLE. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:58.620
ONE OF THEM IS I HAD A- THE

01:25:58.686 --> 01:26:00.788
CONSTITUENT OF A COUPLE OF YEARS

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:04.025
AGO WHO- WAS FIFTY ONE FIFTIES

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:07.695
IN A- MENTAL HEALTH. THIS

01:26:07.762 --> 01:26:10.431
FACILITY IN A MEDICAL FACILITY-

01:26:10.498 --> 01:26:14.135
WHO THEN HAD THE OJ SHOW UP- AT

01:26:14.202 --> 01:26:18.640
HIS HOUSE AND- SAY- YOU HAVE A

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:21.009
REGISTERED FIREARM WE NEED IT

01:26:21.075 --> 01:26:23.478
AND IT'S GONNA OUTLINED HERE IN

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:25.446
THE PACKET HOW THAT HOW THAT

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:28.883
GOES YOU CAN- TRANSMITTERS FOR

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:30.718
SOMEBODY ELSE OR OR GIVE IT UP

01:26:30.785 --> 01:26:33.288
OR THEY CAN STORE FOR USE. AS A

01:26:33.354 --> 01:26:35.657
RECALL THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WAS

01:26:35.723 --> 01:26:37.025
VERY COOPERATIVE SO I SHOULDN'T

01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:40.728
HAVE THE FIREARM- BUT CONTACTED

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:43.932
ME WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT. WHY HIS

01:26:43.998 --> 01:26:45.199
MEDICAL INFORMATION IN THE

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:48.369
FACILITY WAS IN WASN'T PROTECTED

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:50.271
IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE DOJ

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:51.806
FOLKS KNEW HIS MENTAL HEALTH

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:54.375
CONDITION- SO ONE QUESTION I

01:26:54.442 --> 01:26:56.110
HAVE IS WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S

01:26:56.177 --> 01:26:58.379
CREATING ANY COMPLEXITY AT ALL

01:26:58.446 --> 01:27:00.315
MAYBE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE

01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:02.050
CHALLENGE AND I KNOW A LOT OF

01:27:02.116 --> 01:27:04.052
FIFTY ONE FIFTIES HAPPEN. ON THE

01:27:04.118 --> 01:27:06.688
LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE VERSUS THE-

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:09.023
OF MEDICAL PROVIDER SIDE OR THE

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:11.626
SOCIAL WORKER SIDE BUT- DID IT

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:13.528
WELL I NEVER COULD GET A GOOD

01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:15.296
QUITE A GOOD ANSWER TO THAT

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:16.831
QUESTION. ON ON THE CONSTITUENTS

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:20.501
BEHALF HOWEVER IN THIS IS A

01:27:20.568 --> 01:27:24.405
SUBWAY. I SPOKE TO THE ACTUAL-

01:27:24.472 --> 01:27:28.409
THE ACTUAL DOJ OFFICER. WHO HAD

01:27:28.476 --> 01:27:29.978
SHOWED SHOWED UP AT THE HOUSE-

01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:31.679
WHO- WHO HAD REQUESTED THE

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:33.915
RELINQUISHMENT. IN IN-

01:27:33.982 --> 01:27:36.417
CONSISTENT TO SOME DEGREE WITH

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:38.886
THIS WHOLE PRESENTATION TODAY-

01:27:38.953 --> 01:27:43.458
HE SAID THE BIGGER QUESTION IS-

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:45.760
IT WITH FELONIES WITH WITH WITH.

01:27:45.827 --> 01:27:47.862
ALL OF THE THINGS W TALKED

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.731
ABOUT TODAY THAT WOULD. GIVE

01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:53.134
RISE TO A LEGAL PROHIBITION OF

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:54.402
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL FIREARM

01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:56.371
ASIDE FOR MENTAL HEALTH. THAT

01:27:56.437 --> 01:27:59.374
THEY WERE. WERE TO DOJ OFFICERS

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.309
FOR THE BAY AREA THAT WERE

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:04.012
RESPONSIBLE WERE ASSIGNED TO THE

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:06.414
RELINQUISHMENT PROGRAM. AND I

01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:07.982
DON'T REMEMBER I HAVE TO ADMIT

01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:09.817
THIS COUPLE YEARS AGO THE NUMBER

01:28:09.884 --> 01:28:11.586
OF CASES HE SAID THAT THEY HAD

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:13.388
IN THE DATABASE THAT THEY WERE.

01:28:13.454 --> 01:28:16.824
CHARGED WITH PURSUING BUT IT

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:18.893
WAS- BUT AN EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.197
NUMBER YOU KNOW FAR BEYOND WHAT

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:25.099
- ANY PERSON HE WROTE A PERSON

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:26.567
EVEN A CHILD WOULD PROBABLY SAY

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:27.869
IMMEDIATELY THERE'S NO WAY

01:28:27.935 --> 01:28:30.505
YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO ALL

01:28:30.571 --> 01:28:31.773
THOSE- SO PART OF MY QUESTION

01:28:31.839 --> 01:28:34.409
WHICH IS. ANOTHER ONE OF BE

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:35.910
REDUNDANT TO WHAT THE CHURCH'S

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.912
ASKED BUT YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:39.981
THESE DOLLARS ARE INVESTED ON

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:41.382
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SAY THEY

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:44.118
COULD SEE. THE OF YOU KNOW THE

01:28:44.185 --> 01:28:45.253
EMPHASIS ON THE COORDINATOR

01:28:45.319 --> 01:28:48.156
SPECIALLY ON THE FAMILY LOST

01:28:48.222 --> 01:28:48.956
SIGHT OF INTERCEPTING NO. I

01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:52.660
THINK NO. NO THERE SHOULD BE AN

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:54.662
ABSOLUTE NO WIGGLE ROOM IN

01:28:54.729 --> 01:28:57.198
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES- YOU

01:28:57.265 --> 01:28:59.300
KNOW FOR ANYONE TO CONTINUE.

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:01.135
HOLDING A FIRM THAT SENT A

01:29:01.202 --> 01:29:03.271
RESTRAINING ORDER- OR OR OTHER

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:08.509
EVIDENCE OF DVD- BUT BEYOND THAT

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:11.279
- HIS IS THIS. APPROACH THAT

01:29:11.345 --> 01:29:14.449
WERE BEING. THEY WERE LOOKING AT

01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:16.684
TODAY AS PART OF ITS

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:19.153
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IN A KISS

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.255
IN THIS MAYBE THESE QUESTIONS OR

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:22.657
OFFER MISS GIVE MISS WILL HAS

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:26.394
WEBER SORRY OF THIS WEBER- IS

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:31.032
THERE IS PART OF. THE REQUESTED

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:33.101
OR WHERE WE WANT TO GO HI I'M

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:36.070
TRYING TO BOLSTER UP THE F. T.

01:29:36.137 --> 01:29:38.372
E. IN THE DOJ IN TERMS OF THE

01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:39.974
NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT ARE JUST

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:43.010
GOING OUT DOING THE WORK AGES

01:29:43.077 --> 01:29:44.245
IT'S IT SEEMS SO CLEAR TO ME

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:48.883
THAT. THERE'S YOU KNOW EVEN IF

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:50.284
YOU TOOK MENTAL HEALTH OUT OF IT

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:51.285
TEMPORARILY SUGGESTED APPROVED

01:29:51.352 --> 01:29:52.887
SAYING THAT THEY HAD SO MANY

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:55.590
CASES TO PURSUE THAT YOU KNOW

01:29:55.656 --> 01:29:58.025
EASILY EXPANDING THE RANKS BY BY

01:29:58.092 --> 01:30:00.261
FIVE TIMES OR TEN TIMES WOULD

01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:02.263
WOULD NOT OF BEEN LAVISH

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:04.365
RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE

01:30:04.432 --> 01:30:05.633
PROBLEM BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.803
HEARD ANYONE SPEAK TO THAT.

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:11.372
SPECIFIC NEED. WELL SO- I AM

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:13.074
CERTAINLY AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED

01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:14.542
IN GOVERNMENT FOR A LONG TIME

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:16.077
I'M THE LAST PERSON WHO'S GONNA

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:17.645
SAY THERE ARE ENOUGH RESOURCES

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:19.914
AND CERTAINLY- EXAMPLE. SPEAKS

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.449
TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:23.651
PROBABLY THIS IS A SERIOUS

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.486
CONCERN ABOUT LACK OF RESOURCES

01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:26.721
IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:29.257
DESCRIBING- IS THE APPS

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:32.126
ENFORCEMENT UNITS- WHAT IT IS

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:34.295
THAT THE DOJ LEVEL BUT WHAT I'M

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:36.898
MOST. CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:38.766
THOSE FOLKS END UP WITH A LOT

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:40.768
MORE ON THEIR PLATE I WE DON'T

01:30:40.835 --> 01:30:43.204
ACT. IMMEDIATELY AS CLOSE TO THE

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:45.239
TIME OF PROHIBITION AS POSSIBLE

01:30:45.306 --> 01:30:48.242
WHICH MEANS. UTILIZING LOCAL LAW

01:30:48.309 --> 01:30:50.478
ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL COURT

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:53.281
PERSONNEL RIGHT SO IF WE DO A

01:30:53.347 --> 01:30:55.116
BETTER JOB WHICH MAKES MORE

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:57.251
SENSE IN TERMS OF THE INCREASED

01:30:57.318 --> 01:31:00.354
RISK AND DANGER THE LONGER WE

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.290
DELAY- AGAIN KING COUNTY SEATTLE

TESTIMONY TOGETHER. THANK YOU

01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:06.520
FOR HEARING ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE

01:47:06.586 --> 01:47:08.722
. OUR SISTER POLLY KLASS WAS

01:47:08.789 --> 01:47:10.423
KIDNAPPED FROM HER BEDROOM AND

01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:12.526
MURDERED IN NINETEEN NINETY

01:47:12.592 --> 01:47:14.227
THREE AT THE AGE OF TWELVE. I

01:47:14.294 --> 01:47:16.696
WAS ALSO TWELVE YEARS OLD IN

01:47:16.763 --> 01:47:18.965
POLAND'S KIDNAPPING AND SEX.

01:47:19.032 --> 01:47:20.767
LOSING POLY IN THE WAY THAT WE

01:47:20.834 --> 01:47:22.469
DID WAS INCREDIBLY DESTABILIZING

01:47:22.536 --> 01:47:24.504
AND TRAUMATIZING. AND AS

01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:26.540
CHILDREN TO HAVE A STRANGER

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:28.775
COMING TO OUR HOME AND TAKE OUR

01:47:28.842 --> 01:47:30.510
SISTER FROM US. TORE APART THE

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:32.445
FABRIC OF OUR REALITY

01:47:32.512 --> 01:47:34.881
IRREVOCABLY. AT VERY YOUNG AGES

01:47:34.948 --> 01:47:37.384
WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE DARKEST

01:47:37.450 --> 01:47:38.218
SIDE OF HUMANITY WHICH IS AN

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:40.353
EXPERIENCE THAT HAS SENT A

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:41.688
SHOCKWAVE THROUGH OUR LIVES TO

01:47:41.755 --> 01:47:44.224
THIS VERY DAY. WHEN YOU'VE

01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:46.059
EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF A LOVED

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:47.694
ONE TO VIOLENCE IT TOUCHES EVERY

01:47:47.761 --> 01:47:49.796
AREA OF YOUR LIFE. YOUR

01:47:49.863 --> 01:47:51.765
RELATIONSHIPS OR FRIENDSHIPS.

01:47:51.832 --> 01:47:53.500
YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT YOURSELF AND

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:54.801
EVERYONE AROUND YOU THIS IS NOT

01:47:54.868 --> 01:47:56.736
JUST FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

01:47:56.803 --> 01:47:59.639
A LOSS LIKE THIS CHANGES THE WAY

01:47:59.706 --> 01:48:01.274
YOU VIEW THE WORLD FOREVER. WE

01:48:01.341 --> 01:48:02.609
EXPERIENCED YEARS OF FINANCIAL

01:48:02.676 --> 01:48:04.477
INSTABILITY AFTER TRAUMA WHICH

01:48:04.544 --> 01:48:05.312
FORCED US TO RELOCATE

01:48:05.378 --> 01:48:07.581
FREQUENTLY. I ATTENDED FIVE

01:48:07.647 --> 01:48:08.882
DIFFERENT SCHOOLS IN MY FIRST

01:48:08.949 --> 01:48:10.183
TWO YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL BEFORE

01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:11.518
I DROPPED OUT AND STARTED

01:48:11.585 --> 01:48:12.152
ATTENDING COMMUNITY COLLEGE AT

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:13.987
THE AGE OF FIFTEEN. AND AS IS

01:48:14.054 --> 01:48:15.589
TRUE SO MANY SURVIVORS WHO HAVE

01:48:15.655 --> 01:48:16.890
BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES

01:48:16.957 --> 01:48:18.758
AFTER A DEVASTATING LOSS. THAT

01:48:18.825 --> 01:48:20.827
INSTABILITY AND LACK OF SAFETY

01:48:20.894 --> 01:48:22.629
FOLLOWED US WHEREVER E WENT. WE

01:48:22.696 --> 01:48:24.598
SAY ALL OF THIS TO TRY TO

01:48:24.664 --> 01:48:26.399
EXPLAIN HOW VICTIMS OF CRIME

01:48:26.466 --> 01:48:27.167
NEED ONGOING RESOURCES AND

01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:29.803
SUPPORT. QALBI CB IS THE ONLY

01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:31.671
PLACE MANY VICTIMS CAN TURN TO

01:48:31.738 --> 01:48:33.173
TRY TO HEAL AND RECOVER FROM

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:35.275
TRAUMA OR TO RELOCATE OR SECURE

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:36.843
HOUSING FOR THEIR FAMILY. WHICH

01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:39.312
IS WHY THE WORK IT DOES IS SO

01:48:39.379 --> 01:48:41.381
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. WE WANT TO

01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:43.250
ACKNOWLEDGE COMPARED TO MOST OF

01:48:43.316 --> 01:48:45.552
EXTENSIVE CRIME ANNE AND I HAVE

01:48:45.619 --> 01:48:47.587
A GREAT DEAL OF PRIVILEGE. WE'VE

01:48:47.654 --> 01:48:49.589
NEVER HAD TO NAVIGATE SO MANY OF

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:51.124
THE ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS TO

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:52.692
ACCESS THAT MANY OTHER VICTIMS

01:48:52.759 --> 01:48:55.262
FACE. WHERE AS MANY VICTIMS MUST

01:48:55.328 --> 01:48:56.997
FIGHT TO PROVE THAT HARM WAS

01:48:57.063 --> 01:48:58.798
DONE TO THEM AND THAT THEY'RE

01:48:58.865 --> 01:49:00.267
DESERVING OF SUPPORT. ANNE AND I

01:49:00.333 --> 01:49:01.501
HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED AS

01:49:01.568 --> 01:49:03.236
VICTIMS SINCE THE DAY WE LOST

01:49:03.303 --> 01:49:05.739
QUALITY. OUR FAMILY RECEIVED AN

01:49:05.805 --> 01:49:08.008
OUTPOURING OF SYMPATHY WHEN MANY

01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:09.209
SURVIVORS ON THE WRIST EVEN

01:49:09.276 --> 01:49:10.210
RECEIVE THE MOST BASIC

01:49:10.277 --> 01:49:13.146
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THEIR LOST

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:13.713
INCLUDING YOUR COMPENSATION

01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:16.149
FUNDS. EVEN SO WE HAVE BOTH

01:49:16.216 --> 01:49:18.051
EXPERIENCED BARRIERS IN OUR

01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:19.753
ATTEMPTS TO SEEK OUT SUPPORT

01:49:19.819 --> 01:49:22.289
FROM COUNTY CV. OUR DEGREE OF

01:49:22.355 --> 01:49:25.125
PRIVILEGE HEIGHTENS OUR CONCERNS

01:49:25.191 --> 01:49:27.727
EVEN MORE FOR THE MANY MANY

01:49:27.794 --> 01:49:29.629
SURVIVORS WHO HAVE BEEN BLOCKED

01:49:29.696 --> 01:49:32.432
FROM SEEKING OUT THE SUPPORT

01:49:32.499 --> 01:49:33.266
THEY NEED AND DESERVE. BECAUSE

01:49:33.333 --> 01:49:34.901
IF IT WAS THAT CHALLENGING FOR

01:49:34.968 --> 01:49:36.770
US TO NAVIGATE WE IMAGINE THAT

01:49:36.836 --> 01:49:38.405
IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR FOLKS

01:49:38.471 --> 01:49:40.607
WITH FAR LESS PRIVILEGED AND

01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:43.276
PUBLIC VALIDATION. IN TERMS OF

01:49:43.343 --> 01:49:44.978
OUR SPECIFIC EXPERIENCES

01:49:45.045 --> 01:49:46.646
INTERACTING WITH THE B. C. B.

01:49:46.713 --> 01:49:47.847
WE'LL SHARE SOME OF THE STORIES

01:49:47.914 --> 01:49:49.049
NOW TO OFFER A CLEAR

01:49:49.115 --> 01:49:50.650
UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:52.519
CHALLENGES HAVE ARISEN FOR US.

01:49:52.585 --> 01:49:54.454
IN RECENT YEARS I PERSONALLY

01:49:54.521 --> 01:49:55.989
SPENT MONTHS GOING BACK AND

01:49:56.056 --> 01:49:56.723
FORTH WITH THE VICTIM

01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:58.525
COMPENSATION BOARD PROMPTED BY

01:49:58.591 --> 01:50:00.226
SOME PAINFUL SITUATIONS THAT

01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:02.195
AROSE RELATED TO POLLY'S CASE.

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:03.596
EVEN THOUGH I'D BEEN GIVEN A

01:50:03.663 --> 01:50:05.699
CLAIM AS A CHILD I WAS ASKED TO

01:50:05.765 --> 01:50:07.067
RESUBMIT MY APPLICATION MULTIPLE

01:50:07.133 --> 01:50:08.601
TIMES AND THEN TOLD THAT MY

01:50:08.668 --> 01:50:09.636
FORMS WERE NOT VIEWABLE FOR

01:50:09.703 --> 01:50:11.338
REASONS RANGING FROM LAPTOP

01:50:11.404 --> 01:50:13.173
ERRORS TO THE COUNTY FIREWALL.

01:50:13.239 --> 01:50:14.641
USUALLY TOOK AT LEAST TWO OR

01:50:14.708 --> 01:50:16.543
THREE FOLLOW UP EMAILS TO GET A

01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:18.111
RESPONSE FROM PCB OVER MANY

01:50:18.178 --> 01:50:19.846
MONTHS OF GOING BACK AND FORTH.

01:50:19.913 --> 01:50:21.181
THE LACK OF TRAUMA SENSITIVITY

01:50:21.247 --> 01:50:22.782
IN THE RESPONSES I RECEIVED LEFT

01:50:22.849 --> 01:50:24.951
ME FEELING HOPELESS AND WORSEN

01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:26.686
THE PEOPLE SITUATION I WAS AND-

01:50:26.753 --> 01:50:28.254
AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS I LEARNED

01:50:28.321 --> 01:50:30.156
THAT MY ORIGINAL CLAIM HAD

01:50:30.223 --> 01:50:30.790
ALREADY ALREADY BEEN AUTHORIZED

01:50:30.857 --> 01:50:31.958
FOR AND NUMBER COUNSELING

01:50:32.025 --> 01:50:33.727
SESSIONS. BUT I NEVER BEEN MADE

01:50:33.793 --> 01:50:35.895
AWARE OF THAT I WAS LEFT WAITING

01:50:35.962 --> 01:50:37.130
UNNECESSARILY DURING ALL THOSE

01:50:37.197 --> 01:50:40.033
MONTHS NOT SURE HOW TO MOVE MY

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:41.001
APPLICATION FORWARD OR IF MY

01:50:41.067 --> 01:50:42.669
CLEAN WILL BE HONORED AT A TIME

01:50:42.736 --> 01:50:44.437
WHEN I BADLY NEEDED SUPPORT. BY

01:50:44.504 --> 01:50:46.106
THE TIME MY FAMILY FINALLY

01:50:46.172 --> 01:50:47.140
MANAGED TO ECEIVE MY

01:50:47.207 --> 01:50:49.175
REIMBURSEMENT I HAD ALREADY USED

01:50:49.242 --> 01:50:50.143
UP ALL OF MY DESIGNATED

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:51.144
COUNSELING SESSIONS FOR THE

01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:52.612
TREATMENT PLAN APPROVED BY ANY

01:50:52.679 --> 01:50:54.881
BY B. C. B. MY OPTIONS WERE THAN

01:50:54.948 --> 01:50:56.683
TO REAPPLY FOR FURTHER B. C. B.

01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:58.151
SUPPORT WHICH ONLY COVERED ABOUT

01:50:58.218 --> 01:50:59.919
HALF THE COST OF MY COUNSELING.

01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:01.688
OR TO FIND THE FUNDS TO PAY OUT

01:51:01.755 --> 01:51:03.890
OF POCKET AND FORWARD. IN THE

01:51:03.957 --> 01:51:05.358
END I FOUND MY EXPERIENCE WITH

01:51:05.425 --> 01:51:06.960
PCB SO PAINFUL AND FRUSTRATING

01:51:07.027 --> 01:51:08.495
THAT I DECIDED NOT TO UTILIZE

01:51:08.561 --> 01:51:10.697
THE PROGRAM AGAIN. AND IT'S

01:51:10.764 --> 01:51:11.765
IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:13.900
THAT OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO

01:51:13.967 --> 01:51:14.868
THE SEARCH EFFORTS WERE

01:51:14.934 --> 01:51:19.239
STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET

01:51:19.305 --> 01:51:19.973
AFTER EXPERIENCING A SEVERE

01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:21.041
TRAUMA. THE MARKET RIGHT FOR

01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:22.475
THEIR- IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE

01:51:22.542 --> 01:51:24.110
BASELINE EIGHTY ONE DOLLAR

01:51:24.177 --> 01:51:25.211
REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNT THROUGH THE

01:51:25.278 --> 01:51:28.882
CITY. AND HIGHLY SKILLED FROM A

01:51:28.948 --> 01:51:30.583
THERAPIST TYPICAL COST FAR MORE.

01:51:30.650 --> 01:51:32.185
THIS LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATE

01:51:32.252 --> 01:51:34.487
PLACES UNDUE BURDENS ON VICTIMS

01:51:34.554 --> 01:51:35.955
TO FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL ACCEPT

01:51:36.022 --> 01:51:36.923
SUCH A LOW COST FOR THEIR

01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:39.092
SERVICES. OR TO BE IN A POSITION

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:41.227
OF ASKING A THERAPIST TO TAKE

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:42.095
LESS MONEY FOR THEIR HEALING

01:51:42.162 --> 01:51:44.230
SERVICES. PERSONALLY I HAVE HAD

01:51:44.297 --> 01:51:46.299
TO NEGOTIATE WITH THERAPISTS TO

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:47.700
ACCEPT LESS MONEY TO HELP ME

01:51:47.767 --> 01:51:50.570
HEAL WHICH IS AN AWFUL POSITION

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:52.338
TO BEGIN- THOSE TYPES OF

01:51:52.405 --> 01:51:54.841
CONVERSATIONS ARE ALWAYS. HARD

01:51:54.908 --> 01:51:58.912
AND AWKWARD BUT- WHEN I'M IN A

01:51:58.978 --> 01:52:00.880
PLACE OF DESPERATION FOR HELP.

01:52:00.947 --> 01:52:02.248
RECESSION ABOUT MONEY WITH THE

01:52:02.315 --> 01:52:03.917
THERAPIST IS THE LAST THING I

01:52:03.983 --> 01:52:05.852
WANT TO HAVE TO DO. THE ENORMOUS

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:07.821
GAP BETWEEN WHAT I COULD OFFER

01:52:07.887 --> 01:52:09.022
COMPARED TO THE FEES TO

01:52:09.089 --> 01:52:10.423
THERAPISTS TYPICALLY CHARGE.

01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:12.492
LEFT ME WITH A SENSE OF SHAME

01:52:12.559 --> 01:52:13.560
WHICH COMPOUNDED THE

01:52:13.626 --> 01:52:14.627
DIFFICULTIES OF OBTAINING

01:52:14.694 --> 01:52:16.763
SUPPORT AND NEED MY HEALING

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.665
JOURNEY HARDER- ADDITIONALLY

01:52:18.731 --> 01:52:20.567
WHEN I WAS TRYING TO NAVIGATE

01:52:20.633 --> 01:52:22.202
THE B. C. B. SYSTEM I WAS GIVEN

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:23.770
CONFLICTING INFORMATION BY

01:52:23.837 --> 01:52:24.404
DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIVES ABOUT

01:52:24.471 --> 01:52:25.905
TWO SEPARATE ISSUES. WHEN I

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:27.273
CALLED A SUPERVISOR FOR

01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:28.374
CLARIFICATION MY COMMUNICATION

01:52:28.441 --> 01:52:30.844
WASN'T EVER RETURNED- AND I

01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:32.579
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE A LOT

01:52:32.645 --> 01:52:34.614
OF DETAILS TO BE AWARE OF IN A

01:52:34.681 --> 01:52:36.316
SYSTEM LIKE THIS AND THAT

01:52:36.382 --> 01:52:36.850
SOMETIMES PEOPLE CAN BE

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:38.051
MISINFORMED BUT THESE

01:52:38.118 --> 01:52:38.885
CONVERSATIONS ARE HIGHER STAKES

01:52:38.952 --> 01:52:41.354
THAN MOST. AND PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:42.822
ACTUALLY TALKING TO VICTIMS AND

01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:44.624
SURVIVORS ON THE PHONE SHOULD BE

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:46.626
TOTALLY ON THE SAME PAGE WITH

01:52:46.693 --> 01:52:49.629

ACCESS SUPPORT- AND ALSO

01:52:53.233 --> 01:52:54.100
SOMETHING THAT HAS WEIGHED

01:52:54.167 --> 01:52:56.102
HEAVILY ON ME OVER THE YEARS IS

01:52:56.169 --> 01:52:58.204
WHETHER I'D FIND OUT IF THE

01:52:58.271 --> 01:52:59.072
PERSON WHO KILLED POLY. HAD ANY

01:52:59.139 --> 01:53:00.874
SORT OF STATUS CHANGE WHILE IN

01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:02.342
PRISON. LIKE DEATH OR TRANSFER

01:53:02.408 --> 01:53:05.044
TO ANOTHER PRISON OR WHETHER

01:53:05.111 --> 01:53:06.913
THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY OF A RE

01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:08.148

NOTIFIED IF THERE WERE ANY

01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:17.157
STATUS CHANGES. AND THIS SPEAKS

01:53:17.223 --> 01:53:18.358
TO THE LACK OF RESOURCES PUT

01:53:18.424 --> 01:53:20.059

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:24.664
WHEN A PERSON HAS EXPERIENCED

01:53:24.731 --> 01:53:26.566
THE WORST THING THAT COULD EVER

01:53:26.633 --> 01:53:27.500
HAPPEN TO THEM. THEY SHOULDN'T

01:53:27.567 --> 01:53:28.568
HAVE TO NAVIGATE MOUNTAINS OF

PAPERWORK OR ENGAGE WITH THE

01:53:29.903 --> 01:53:31.004
SYSTEM THAT IS INHERENTLY

01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:32.572
SKEPTICAL OF WHETHER THEIR PAIN

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:35.508
IS REAL. MOST OF US CAN ADVOCATE

01:53:35.575 --> 01:53:36.676
FOR OURSELVES WHEN WE'RE IN THE

01:53:36.743 --> 01:53:37.877
MIDST OF SURVIVING A LOSS LIKE

01:53:37.944 --> 01:53:40.280

KNOW HAS THAT CHANGED- WHAT WHAT

02:11:35.754 --> 02:11:37.756
IS THAT RELATIONSHIP. I KNOW

02:11:37.823 --> 02:11:39.524
THAT SURE ISN'T A DIFFICULT

02:11:39.591 --> 02:11:42.160
PLACE FOR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:11:42.227 --> 02:11:43.862
YES MA'AM AND I THINK- BUT THE

02:11:43.929 --> 02:11:45.497
BEAUTY OF THIS COLLABORATIVE IS

02:11:45.564 --> 02:11:47.032
THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME ABOUT MY

02:11:47.099 --> 02:11:48.634
DEPARTMENT BUT IT REALLY IS THE

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:50.502
CONSENSUS ACROSS ELEVEN CITIES

02:11:50.569 --> 02:11:52.237
HERE IN THE NORTH SO ALL ELEVEN

02:11:52.304 --> 02:11:54.139
POLICE AGENCIES. HAVE KIND OF

02:11:54.206 --> 02:11:56.141
SHIFTED THE MINDSET OF LAW

02:11:56.208 --> 02:11:59.978
ENFORCEMENT INTO- SERVICES FIRST

02:12:00.045 --> 02:12:02.881
ENFORCEMENT LAST I THINK ALL OF

02:12:02.948 --> 02:12:03.815
US HERE ESPECIALLY IN THE

02:12:03.882 --> 02:12:05.317
NORTHWESTERN AREA I UNDERSTAND

02:12:05.384 --> 02:12:07.819
FULLY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO

02:12:07.886 --> 02:12:09.788
ARREST OUR WAY OUT OF ALMOST IS

02:12:09.855 --> 02:12:11.623
THE ISSUE. AND SO WHAT WE DO IS

02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:14.259
WE TAKE PASSIONATE- RELATIONSHIP

02:12:14.326 --> 02:12:16.928
BUILDING APPROACH AND WE BUILD A

02:12:16.995 --> 02:12:18.897
REPORT WITH THE MOST MEMBERS IN

02:12:18.964 --> 02:12:19.364
ARCADIA EXPERIENCING

02:12:19.431 --> 02:12:21.800
HOMELESSNESS TO GET THE BEST

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:22.801
OUTCOME FOR THEM BECAUSE THAT'S

02:12:22.868 --> 02:12:24.536
TRULY WHERE SUCCESS LIES NOT IN

02:12:24.603 --> 02:12:26.204
IN IN INCARCERATION OR EVEN

02:12:26.271 --> 02:12:27.806
CITATION. AND PUTTING SOMEONE

02:12:27.873 --> 02:12:30.676
INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:12:30.742 --> 02:12:32.611
AND SO BUT THE POSTURE THAT WE

02:12:32.678 --> 02:12:34.680
TAKE YEARS SERVICES FIRST

02:12:34.746 --> 02:12:37.716
ENFORCEMENT LAST AND THAT THAT'S

02:12:37.783 --> 02:12:39.718
WHY THAT I'LL REACH FOR TOOLS

02:12:39.785 --> 02:12:40.652
BEEN SO IMPORTANT FOR US

02:12:40.719 --> 02:12:42.220
BECAUSE- IT GIVES THAT PERSON

02:12:42.287 --> 02:12:43.455
YEAH INDIVIDUAL THAT WE'RE

02:12:43.522 --> 02:12:45.123
DEALING WITH BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE

02:12:45.190 --> 02:12:46.358
FOUND THROUGH OUR PROCESS OF THE

02:12:46.425 --> 02:12:48.126
LAST FIVE YEARS IS THAT. THE

02:12:48.193 --> 02:12:49.795
EXPERIENCING HOMES JUST OUR

02:12:49.861 --> 02:12:51.229
INDIVIDUAL AND HOW THEY GOT

02:12:51.296 --> 02:12:52.998
THERE AN INDIVIDUAL OUT HOW

02:12:53.065 --> 02:12:53.732
THEY'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF

02:12:53.799 --> 02:12:56.368
THERE AND SO IF AN OFFICER WHO'S

02:12:56.435 --> 02:12:57.602
NEVER. THIS PARTICULAR

02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:59.304
INDIVIDUAL BEFORE COULD HAVE

02:12:59.371 --> 02:13:02.207
THEIR STORY IN FRONT OF THEM IT

02:13:02.274 --> 02:13:04.109
SERVE THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO

02:13:04.176 --> 02:13:06.912
BRIDGE THAT REPORT GAP A LOT

02:13:06.978 --> 02:13:08.814
QUICKER OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER THIS

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:11.149
IS IT THE CARD AND SO I THINK

02:13:11.216 --> 02:13:13.085
WHEN I WHEN I TALK ABOUT WHAT WE

02:13:13.151 --> 02:13:17.622
DO HERE IN NORTH ORANGE COUNTY.

02:13:17.689 --> 02:13:20.025
IS FOCUS ON THAT FIRST OF COURSE

02:13:20.092 --> 02:13:21.626
ENFORCED IS A TWO THAT WE CAN

02:13:21.693 --> 02:13:23.362
EMPLOY. BUT WE WANT TO BRING

02:13:23.428 --> 02:13:24.563
THOSE RESOURCES TO BEAR THAT'S

02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:26.098
GOING TO GET THAT PERSON TO A

02:13:26.164 --> 02:13:27.899
BETTER PLACE INTO A PLACE WHERE

02:13:27.966 --> 02:13:30.469
THEY WANT TO BE. OKAY THANK YOU

02:13:30.535 --> 02:13:34.606

THIS. SO IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE

02:13:37.776 --> 02:13:39.878
I'M BY DIE KUNST I'M NOT SURE WE

02:13:39.945 --> 02:13:42.347
CAN SEE THAT THE CHIEF AND- MISS

02:13:42.414 --> 02:13:45.984

JUST SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW A GOOD

02:13:52.457 --> 02:13:54.393
IDEA. WHEN I HEAR IT ABOUT FIVE

02:13:54.459 --> 02:13:56.628
YEARS AGO OF A GROUP OF CITY

02:13:56.695 --> 02:13:57.929
MANAGER'S CHIEFS CAME. TO MY

02:13:57.996 --> 02:13:59.664
OFFICE IN THE THEY HAD AN IDEA

02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:01.767
THEY'D BE AND IT WAS BASED ON

02:14:01.833 --> 02:14:03.135
OBSERVATION THE OBSERVATION WAS

02:14:03.201 --> 02:14:04.369
THAT. THE EFFORTS AT LEAST

02:14:04.436 --> 02:14:05.170
LOCALLY RUN HOMELESSNESS HAD

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:07.706
DEFIED- BE SORT OF MUNICIPAL

02:14:07.773 --> 02:14:09.241
EFFORTS RIGHT THAT THAT CITY

02:14:09.307 --> 02:14:10.642
LEVELED TO THE PROBLEM IS TOO

02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:12.711
BIG- TO ADDRESS KIND OF ON A

02:14:12.778 --> 02:14:14.679
CITY BY CITY BASIS AND AT THE

02:14:14.746 --> 02:14:16.715
STATE LEVEL- TOP DOWN SOLUTIONS

02:14:16.782 --> 02:14:18.283
DIDN'T REALLY WORK AND SO THE

02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:20.085
IDEA WAS WHAT IF WE COULD WE

02:14:20.152 --> 02:14:21.219
COULD. WE COULD CREATE. A

02:14:21.286 --> 02:14:21.953
REGIONAL APPROACH TO THAT USED

02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:23.855
AS ITS BASIS YOU KNOW THE RIGHT

02:14:23.922 --> 02:14:26.558
SIZE. UNIT AND THAT THAT STARTED

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:28.727
AS EIGHT CITIES IS NOW ELEVEN.

02:14:28.794 --> 02:14:31.163
AND IT- VERY GRATEFUL TO SU

02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:33.565
GANG- TO CHIEF CORPORATION IS IT

02:14:33.632 --> 02:14:36.067
WHEN PARK JUST RETIRED- FOR

02:14:36.134 --> 02:14:37.702
THEIR LEADERSHIP IN AL CHIEF

02:14:37.769 --> 02:14:39.104

INNOVATIONS HERE WERE. THE THIS

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:46.945
COLLAB. EFFORT LED TO INCREASE

02:14:47.012 --> 02:14:48.914
COORDINATION- BETTER ALIGNMENT

02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:50.882
BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY- THAT

02:14:50.949 --> 02:14:52.551
RESULTED IN A LIKE CAPACITY

02:14:52.617 --> 02:14:53.852
BUILDING BUT ALSO INNOVATION-

02:14:53.919 --> 02:14:56.388
AND SO NO NO SMALL THING. TO

02:14:56.455 --> 02:14:57.923
HAVE. CREATED THIS MOBILE

02:14:57.989 --> 02:15:00.158
PLATFORM WHICH IS SOLVING A VERY

02:15:00.225 --> 02:15:02.027
REAL PROBLEM EVERY SINGLE CITY

02:15:02.093 --> 02:15:03.195

02:15:03.261 --> 02:15:05.130
CONNECTING ON HOUSE PEOPLE TO

02:15:05.197 --> 02:15:06.665

INSTITUTIONALIZED JUST BROKE. IT

02:15:18.343 --> 02:15:21.213
BUT IT'S THE IDEA IS THIS IS A

02:15:21.279 --> 02:15:22.948
MODEL WHICH IS VERY WORTHY OF

02:15:23.014 --> 02:15:24.449
REPLICATION. AND FURTHER

02:15:24.516 --> 02:15:27.886
INNOVATION- AND- YOU KNOW WHEN

02:15:27.953 --> 02:15:29.888
YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNTS OF MONEY

02:15:29.955 --> 02:15:30.989
THE MAN SPENT ON ON

02:15:31.056 --> 02:15:31.990
HOMELESSNESS- OVER THE LAST
