00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:58.003
M. STATIONS THAT HAVE TO LOWER

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.139

C. S. CHU CHI. R. G. T. E. C. R.

00:30:52.317 --> 00:30:55.787
IT CETERA- IT'S VERY HARD I

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:58.556
THINK FOR US AS LEGISLATORS TO

00:30:58.623 --> 00:31:00.124
REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW ALL OF

00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:02.393
THESE WORK TOGETHER AND TO SEE

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.331
WHAT THIS BILLS OF THE CPUC

00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:08.933
ALREADY- WAS ASKED TO LOOK AT

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.835
TWICE NOW TO LOOK AT A SIMILAR

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:14.405
PROGRAM. THEY BASICALLY SAID. WE

00:31:14.472 --> 00:31:17.308
HOPE HELLO ENOUGH RIGHT NOW TO

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.310
DO SOMETHING WE NEED MORE TIME-

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:21.879
IN IT CAN. BOTH THE CONSULTANT

00:31:21.946 --> 00:31:23.815
AND FRANKLY THE ANALYSIS SAYS

00:31:23.881 --> 00:31:25.917
THAT THERE IS LIKELY TO BE A

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:29.320
COST SHIFT- WHAT'S THE OTHER

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:40.898
CONCERN KASHIF- ONE MORE. AREA.

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:44.636
I GUESS THAT'S ENOUGH- THE- THE

00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:46.738
OTHER THING IS WE WE'RE GOING TO

00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:48.840
HAVE NO TROUBLE AT ALL BUILDING

00:31:48.906 --> 00:31:52.443
ALL THE SOLAR WE MEET- BECAUSE

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.646
WE ALREADY HAVE THE MANDATE.

00:31:54.712 --> 00:31:57.548
UTILITIES CAN BE. YOU KNOW THEY

00:31:57.615 --> 00:31:59.450
CAN PUT IN FORM THAT'S THE

00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:01.119
EQUIVALENT OF THOUSANDS AND

00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:02.787
THOUSANDS MIL MAYBE EVEN A

00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:05.723
MILLION HOMES WITH JUST ONE FARM

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.293
. SO I DON'T THINK THEY NEED IN

00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:10.361
TERMS OF REACHING OUR GOALS. I

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:12.664
THINK THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.432
FOR ME ANYWAY TO FIGURE OUT

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:17.468
WHAT'S GOING ON. THE CPUC HAS

00:32:17.535 --> 00:32:18.936
SAID THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:32:19.003 --> 00:32:20.171
INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND THAT

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:23.675
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T. I WOULD

00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:26.044
PREFERRED THAT THERE SIMPLY GOT

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.546
ONE. THANK YOU. DR ANY OTHER

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:31.683

TRY TO. YOU KNOW HAVE A- SOME

00:32:39.123 --> 00:32:41.459
KIND OF CONVERSATION REGARDING

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:44.295
ANYTHING THE CPC DOES THAT'S

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:49.701
OFTENTIMES- JUST FOR LACK OF A

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:52.070
BETTER WORD IT JUST IT TAKES A

00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:52.737
LONG TIME FOR THE PC TO ACTUALLY

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:54.439
DO SOMETHING. AND I DON'T MEAN

00:32:54.505 --> 00:32:56.574
TO BE DISRESPECTFUL TO THE P. C.

00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:58.609
R. TO THE FOLKS THERE BUT WE

00:32:58.676 --> 00:33:00.211
HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE ISSUE

00:33:00.278 --> 00:33:02.413
OF THE KASHIF RELATED TO NOT A

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.982
JIMMY DURING FOR QUITE SOME TIME

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:07.985
IN FACT THE PC HAS MANDATED. TO

00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:09.854
THERE IS NOW IN THE- A NEW

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:11.956
LEADERSHIP AT THE P. YOU SEE ADS

00:33:14.425 --> 00:33:16.627
NEW AND I NEED TO CATCH UP AND I

00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:18.463
NEED TO DO THIS EVEN THOUGH

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:20.231
STAFF HAS BEEN THERE FOR MANY

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:22.066
YEARS AND SO I JUST YOU KNOW I

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:24.335
WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE

00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:25.370
INTENT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:33:25.436 --> 00:33:26.604
CREATE BUT- BASED EVEN ON THE

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:27.839
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT GOES

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:29.507
FURTHER THAN THE BILL THAT I

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:31.642
CURRENTLY HAVE ON TWENTY. TWENTY

00:33:31.709 --> 00:33:32.777
ONE FORTY THREE RELATED TO NAM

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:35.847
AND PREVAILING WAGE. AND I'M I'M

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:37.715
A LITTLE CONCERNED OF ADDING

00:33:37.782 --> 00:33:41.119
ADDITIONAL. UP WORK TO THE P.

00:33:41.185 --> 00:33:43.287
YOU SEE WHEN THEY HAVE YET TO DO

00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:45.256
THE WORK THAT THEY CURRENTLY

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:47.425
HAVE AND SO I WILL BE VOTING IN

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:49.660
SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I

00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:51.028
HOPE THAT AS THE RECISIONS FULL

00:33:51.095 --> 00:33:53.131
WHAT WE CAN BUY SOME CONCERNS

00:33:53.197 --> 00:33:55.433
THAT BASED. I'M PERSONALLY

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.902
RELATES DOLLAR PREVAILING WAGE

00:33:57.969 --> 00:33:59.804
RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR

00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:02.073
ADDRESSING THE CAUTION- AND THEN

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.441
REALLY ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:05.910
HOW DO WE CREATE. A CLEAN GREEN

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:07.378
ECONOMY WITH THE WORK FORCE THAT

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:09.847
IS. EARNING THAT SAME WAY H. AS

00:34:09.914 --> 00:34:11.449
IN THE REDUCTION OF FOSSIL FUEL

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:15.219
SO ALL OF THAT IS COMBINED. AND

00:34:15.286 --> 00:34:16.120
THESE ARE THINGS THAT YOU AND I.

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:18.689

THIS AND AGAIN MINDFUL THAT-

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.681
WITH THAT SOMETHING THE

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:44.949
AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:47.418
BE REALLY WORKING SOME OF THE

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:50.822
IMMIGRATION DETAILS THROUGH THE

00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:53.057
PVC. PIPE SHARE. SUMMARY OF THE

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:55.326
ISSUE OF THE PC AND THEIR

00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:57.228
ACTIONS AND I'M SURE THERE ARE

00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:58.729
REASONS WHY THEY TAKE AS LONG AS

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.731
THEY DO- BUT TO THE EXTENT OF

00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:02.834
THEIR THE ISSUE WE BELIEVE WITH

00:35:06.971 --> 00:35:08.739
THAT ON THE COSTS OF USE WILL

00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:11.609
BE. NEGLIGIBLE AT BEST AND

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:13.211
HOPEFULLY WILL NOT BE THERE AT

00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:16.314

THESE TERMS- YOU CANNOT ASK FOR

IF IN THE SETTLEMENT. THEY DON'T

COULD DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:46.149

MAKING. THAT PART OF THE

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:51.221
SETTLEMENT THE THIRD CONCERN I

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:53.623
HAVE IS THAT IN EFFECT THIS

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.859
LIMITS WHAT YOU CAN SUE FOR. AND

00:54:55.925 --> 00:54:58.662
HERE'S WHAT I'M ME IF THE H. G.

00:54:58.728 --> 00:55:00.697
IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL GETS

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:02.999

WHERE THE COUNTIES ARE SO SMALL.

00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:08.872
AND THEY REALLY CAN'T BRING THE

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:11.608
SUIT. IT REALLY LIMITS WHAT THAT

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:13.943
THE AG COULD DO THE AG FOR

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:15.478

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:19.282
ALRIGHT SYSTEM WIDE. G. IN AB

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:21.317
THAT'S HAS ALL THESE SMALL

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:23.219
COUNTIES THAT- YOU'RE GOING TO

00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:26.523
HAVE TO DO X. Y. AND Z. HERE.

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:27.957
AND THAT COULD END UP BAY

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:29.993
UNDERGROUND LINES WHATEVER A

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.962
HUGE COST. SOMETHING THAT MIGHT

00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:34.764
SEND THE COMPANY INTO BANKRUPTCY

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:36.866
WHICH WE DO NOT WANT TO DO SO

00:55:36.933 --> 00:55:39.636
THE AGE SHE CAN'T ASK FOR THAT

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:41.871
BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:44.207
BANKRUPTCY FOR THE COMPANY. AND

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:46.009
THAT'S WE'VE LEARNED THAT'S NOT

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:48.778
SMART. SO THIS IN EFFECT WHAT

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:50.380
THE STATE BILL IS DOING IS

00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:52.882

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:46.495
THE CONNECT IT THE ELECTRICITY

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:49.031
RELIABILITY ISSUES ADDRESSED SO

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:50.365
THE IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:11.153
RELIABILITY THAT THAT IS WHY

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:14.589
THOSE TWO PRIOR EXTENSIONS WERE

THOUGHT THE BILL THAT COULD NOT

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:41.877

BOARD MAKES THE DETERMINATION

01:19:47.649 --> 01:19:49.885

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:51.286
WAS MADE THE ACTUAL

OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY INTO.

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:16.811
GIVES THE DEFECTIVE DECISION. TO

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:20.882
SACK WAS. AS IF YOU READ IT IT

01:20:20.949 --> 01:20:23.051
SAYS THAT THE STATE BOARD SHALL

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:25.253
NOT GRANT AN OPERATOR AND

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.557
EXTENSION. IF SACRIFICE AS THE

01:20:28.623 --> 01:20:31.760
IF THE POWER IS NOT NEEDED. OKAY

01:20:31.826 --> 01:20:33.962
AND I AGREE WITH YOU. ABOUT THE

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:36.464
UNCONSTITUTIONALLY BECAUSE IT'S

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:38.433
NOT IN STATUTE. THE WATER BOARD

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:43.004
COULD ADD ADDITIONAL ADVISORY

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:45.006
PARTICIPATES AT THEIR OWN AT

01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:47.275
THEIR OWN DISCRETION THE WAY

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:49.477
THAT SACK WAS WORKS IS IT HAS TO

01:20:49.544 --> 01:20:52.113
BE YOU UNANIMOUS DECISION OF THE

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:54.482
THREE PAGES THAT'S HOUSING EIGHT

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:57.619
TWO THAT'S VERY. BUT WHAT THE

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:58.720
AUTHOR DIDN'T. MENTION IN TO

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:01.089
QUESTION IT'S STILL DELEGATES

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:04.993
THIS IS ALSO THIS AUTHORITY TO

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:06.061
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND AS A

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:08.263
PROP TO THAT. THE TROUBLE.

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:10.465
THERE'S THAT THAT'S WHERE THE

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:12.601
REAL CONSTITUTIONAL. IT

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:13.902
APPROPRIATE DELEGATION OF

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:16.137
AUTHORITY LIES IS GREAT BUT YOU

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:17.906
ALSO HAVE TO THEN GO GET THE

01:21:17.973 --> 01:21:21.042
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SIGN OFF ON

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:25.380
THAT- THAT'S WHAT WE OBJECT YOU

01:21:25.447 --> 01:21:25.947

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:29.784
BROUGHT. WHAT YEP TO. REFERENCE

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.488
DOCUMENT THAT SHOWS ITS

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.824
COMMITMENT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.993
COMMITMENT MADE BY THE WATER

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:39.227
BOARD SO THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:41.663
THAT'S THAT IS TO BE USED ENOUGH

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:44.733

DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CYCLES

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.142
SO I THINK THE FIRST POINT YOU
