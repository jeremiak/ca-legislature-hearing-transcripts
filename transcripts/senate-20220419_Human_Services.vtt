MANY TIMES INFORMATION SHARING

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:32.151
COLLECTED IS LATER USED AGAINST

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:34.287
THEM. THE PROCESS IS NOT ONLY

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:36.656
INTIMIDATING BUT HUMILIATING AND

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:37.824
MANY FAMILIES HERE THAT THEY

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.359
HAVE TO BEG FOR SERVICES THAT

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:42.562
THEIR CHILDREN NEED. PERSONALLY

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:43.763
WHEN FAMILIES FIND THEMSELVES

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.765
CONFRONTED BY AN ATTORNEY THAT

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.099
WAS HIGHER BY THE REGIONAL

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:49.135
CENTER AND PAID BY TAXPAYER

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:51.504
DOLLARS. THESE HEARINGS ARE

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:53.806
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:55.408
NAVIGATE WITHOUT HAVING AN

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:58.244
ATTORNEY OF THEIR OWN. THIS IS

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.513
SOMETHING THAT MOST OF US CAN

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.482
AFFORD. WHAT I SHARE WITH YOU

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:06.485
TODAY IS A REALITY. WE ALSO

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:07.153
BELIEVE THAT REGIONAL CENTERS IN

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.155
OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD BE WORKING

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:11.490
TOGETHER AS PARTNERS NOT WORKING

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:13.326
AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. HE WAS

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:15.695
DECISIONS MAKING SUPPOSED TO BE

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.630
A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:19.465
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:21.701
ROADBLOCKS MANY HAVE JUST GIVEN

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:24.804
UP AND PURSUED THE SERVICES. OR

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:27.039
STOP PURSUING THE SERVICES THAT

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:28.741
THEIR LOVED ONE'S NEEDS. WE

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:30.176
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS HOPE WE

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:32.011
BELIEVE IN SENATE BILL TEN

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.279

ADDRESSES THEIR SERVICES. WE

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.365
ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL ENSURE

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:54.500
THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS MAKE A

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:55.902

THIS PUT THIS BILL THAT WE'RE

00:38:54.031 --> 00:38:55.433

WILL FINALLY LAND IN BUT I DO

00:39:18.255 --> 00:39:19.223
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WE

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.025
TRY NOT TO SET UP AN ADVERSARIAL

00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:22.359
RELATIONS THE PURPOSE OF THE

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:23.394
REGIONAL CENTERS THE PURPOSE OF

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:25.529
THE VOTE NOW THAT THAT THE DDS

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:27.431

MOVES FORWARD IS. PROBABLY THE

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:35.740

THAT WE DO MAKE A PROCESS THAT.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.516
WORKS BETTER FOR FAMILIES. AND

00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:47.918
ALSO IS MORE EQUITABLE BECAUSE

FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITIES WE

AT A COST SAVINGS TO THE STATE.

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:41.031
THIS VENDOR WOULD WORK

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:42.933

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.205
THEREBY RESULTING IN EVEN MORE

I'M NOT AWARE THAT THAT HAS

01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:27.174
HAPPENED TO DATE- BUT I THINK AS

01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:29.443
WE BOTH OF THE TWO WITNESSES FOR

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:31.011
THE BILL THAT. IS A GROWING

01:37:31.078 --> 01:37:34.014
PROBLEM WE'RE SEEING IT IN A

01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:36.550
OFFICES- SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT

01:37:36.617 --> 01:37:38.018
THERE WERE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY

01:37:38.085 --> 01:37:41.855
FIVE PEOPLE GOT RID OFF.

01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:42.423
EIGHTEEN IS A FAIR NUMBER OF

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:44.158
PEOPLE THIS IS. TO AYE THINK

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:45.726
YOU'RE POINT IS VERY WELL TAKEN

01:37:45.793 --> 01:37:46.961
MADAM CHAIR THAT THIS IS A

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:48.195
GROWING PROBLEM SOMETHING THAT

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:49.063
THE COMMITTEE SHOULD REALLY KEEP

01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:51.565
AN EYE ON AS WE GO FORWARD. AND

01:37:51.632 --> 01:37:52.866
MAY WANT TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT

01:37:52.933 --> 01:37:54.201
ITSELF TO COME BACK AND REPORT

01:37:54.268 --> 01:37:56.136
ON THE DATA. THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:57.638
ACTUALLY- BUT THE REASON WHY I

01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:59.506
ASK IS BECAUSE I DO HAVE A CYBER

01:37:59.573 --> 01:38:01.242
SECURITY BILL. BUT THE FOCUS IS

01:38:01.308 --> 01:38:03.844
ON. WATER AND FOOD SLASH

01:38:03.911 --> 01:38:06.046
AGRICULTURE BUT IT DOESN'T. I'M

01:38:06.113 --> 01:38:07.815
NOT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT.

01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:09.750
ACTUALLY EXTENDS TO. YOUR THE

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:11.252
SOCIAL SERVICES AND I THINK

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:12.987
THAT. THE BILL SHOULD. ACTUALLY

01:38:13.053 --> 01:38:17.891
BE EXPANDED TO ARE CRITICAL. AS

01:38:17.958 --> 01:38:20.761
FIFTY OF SEX. I MEANT TO. HAPPEN

01:38:20.828 --> 01:38:23.998
REAL UNDERSTANDING OF. WHAT HOW

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:27.534
BAD IT IS AND WHAT MORE WE NEED

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.370
TO DO TO DO RIGHT BECAUSE I I'M

01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:31.305
I'M ASSUMING IT'S AT MINIMUM

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:34.742
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE

01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:36.110
THAT WE JUST WE DON'T HAVE

01:38:36.176 --> 01:38:39.480
ANYMORE AND SO I REALLY PPQ-

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:42.416

01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:44.451

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:47.087
DEVELOP TWENTY QUESTIONS OR

01:38:47.154 --> 01:38:49.456

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:55.429
BILL FORWARD- THERE WAS A

01:38:55.496 --> 01:38:58.866
COMMENT IN THE- IN THE ANALYSIS-

01:38:58.932 --> 01:39:00.868
THAT AND IT IS IT'S ROUND I

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:02.169
GUESS THE TERM ELECTRONIC

01:39:02.236 --> 01:39:03.470
BENEFITS WHETHER THERE'S CLEARLY

01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:04.938
IN THAT VERSES THAT THE USING

CASH AND FOOD BENEFITS I KNOW

01:39:07.007 --> 01:39:08.175

CLARIFY THAT. IT'S NOT JUST

01:39:09.376 --> 01:39:11.779
PLEASE VISIT CASH. BUT I THINK

01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:13.847
IT WAS ALSO THE CONSOLE AT LEAST

01:39:13.914 --> 01:39:15.082
IN THEIR HOUSES THEY RAISE THE

01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:16.317
ISSUE OF WHETHER THE TERM

01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:17.584
ELECTRONIC BENEFITS IS CLEAR

01:39:17.651 --> 01:39:19.420
ENOUGH FOR WHAT WE HAVE TO

01:39:19.486 --> 01:39:20.688
BETTER DEFINE THAT OR USE

01:39:20.754 --> 01:39:22.222
ANOTHER TERMINOLOGY SO. I'M THE

01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:24.892

02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:45.016
PEOPLE LINED UP I THINK SHE HAD

02:28:45.082 --> 02:28:52.223
THREE HAD AWAITING A POINT.

02:28:52.290 --> 02:28:54.025
RECIDIVISM OF PEOPLE WHO GET

02:28:54.091 --> 02:28:56.260
HOUSING FIRST AND THEN DON'T

02:28:56.327 --> 02:28:58.629
KEEP THE HOUSE WHY DON'T BACK ON

02:28:58.696 --> 02:28:59.730
THE STREET LOSE THEIR CHILDREN

02:28:59.797 --> 02:29:01.499
BECAUSE THEY ARE BACK IN THEIR

02:29:01.565 --> 02:29:04.068
ADDICTION OR WHATEVER. THOSE ARE

02:29:04.135 --> 02:29:05.136
THE THINGS THAT HAVE TO COME

02:29:05.202 --> 02:29:07.071
HOME. UP LUCIEN AND I THINK

02:29:07.138 --> 02:29:09.407
THAT'S BEEN MISSING AND I DO

02:29:09.473 --> 02:29:11.909
BELIEVE CONGRESS IS ABOUT TO

02:29:11.976 --> 02:29:14.245
SING FOR. WHAT IS BUS YOU'LL

02:29:14.312 --> 02:29:16.814
HAVE. TO WONDER THE- AND NOT TO

02:29:16.881 --> 02:29:18.282
DENY THEM A HOUSING FIRST

02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:20.951
WITHOUT THE PROGRAMMATIC-

02:29:21.018 --> 02:29:23.921
PROGRAMS THAT ARE THERE BUT NOT

02:29:23.988 --> 02:29:25.389
TO DENY PEOPLE WHO ARE OFFERING

02:29:25.456 --> 02:29:28.292
THAT GIVES SOME FUNDING TO

02:29:28.359 --> 02:29:32.163
EXPAND THAT. TO YOU OUT OF OUR

02:29:32.229 --> 02:29:33.731
EIGHT- AND I THINK OUR

02:29:33.798 --> 02:29:35.066
TREATMENTS FOR ESPECIALLY THOSE

02:29:35.132 --> 02:29:37.768
I THINK I'M THINKING FAMILIES IN

02:29:37.835 --> 02:29:39.670
PARTICULAR SENATOR KIRSTEN IS

02:29:39.737 --> 02:29:41.405
THE BECAUSE THOSE ARE. THE

02:29:41.472 --> 02:29:43.140
SUFFERING LIVE IN THERE INTEL'S

02:29:43.207 --> 02:29:45.976
CHILLED. THEN THE CHILDREN ARE

02:29:46.043 --> 02:29:47.211
TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM BECAUSE

02:29:47.278 --> 02:29:49.080
WITHOUT THE TRY TO GET HIM BACK

02:29:49.146 --> 02:29:51.115
MEANWHILE ARE THE RISKS THIS

02:29:51.182 --> 02:29:54.018
FROM IT FAILED BEING REUNITED

02:29:54.085 --> 02:29:56.520

TELL YEAH HOUSING FIRST- AND-

02:35:07.564 --> 02:35:09.299
THERE ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE SOME

02:35:09.366 --> 02:35:10.267
IMPLICATION THAT UNDER HOUSING

02:35:10.334 --> 02:35:11.335
FIRST YOU CAN ACTUALLY BEAT

02:35:11.402 --> 02:35:14.605

FIRST SO BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S

02:35:37.628 --> 02:35:42.232
A SENSE THAT WHILE HOUSING FIRST

02:35:42.299 --> 02:35:43.367
MEANS WE CAN SIMPLY GIVE SOMEONE

02:35:43.434 --> 02:35:50.541
AND CAN'T PUT. YES FINAL- IT L.

02:35:50.607 --> 02:35:51.775

02:39:08.839 --> 02:39:11.608
OTHER SIDE- STUDIES THAT DON'T

BECAUSE THEY RELAPSE YOU KNOW

02:40:10.634 --> 02:40:13.136
IDEALLY THERE COULD BE A CHOICE

02:40:13.203 --> 02:40:15.572
AND IF THERE TRULY WAS A CHOICE

02:40:15.639 --> 02:40:18.408

LOT OF OPTIONS BUT THE PRACTICE

02:40:47.471 --> 02:40:48.939
OF THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL IS

02:40:49.006 --> 02:40:51.274

03:22:45.119 --> 03:22:47.255
BEEN WITH BOTH OF THE PARCEL

03:22:47.321 --> 03:22:49.223

OUT THERE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS

03:22:53.261 --> 03:22:55.162
IT'S LIKELY BECAUSE HE'S OUR WAS

03:22:55.229 --> 03:22:57.164
MICKEY MANTLE FAMILIES THAT

THE PIECE THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING

03:23:13.848 --> 03:23:16.450

03:23:30.498 --> 03:23:32.934
IMPORTANT IS IN FINANCIAL

03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:34.902

03:23:58.326 --> 03:24:00.661
IN IF WITH IF THE PROGRAM

03:24:00.728 --> 03:24:01.462
