BUT I'M GONNA [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN [inaudible] REYES [inaudible] STONE [inaudible] THURMOND. WE HAVE QUIRK [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE HAVE SB ONE THIRTY FOR A BI HERNANDEZ -- REGIONAL CENTER CONTRACTS. BY MISTER RUDY SALAS. BUT YOU'RE GONNA CHAIR THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME PRESENT ON BEHALF OF SENATOR HERNANDEZ SENATE BILL. ONE THIRTY FOUR A SO BILL ONE THIRTY FOUR DEALS WITH REGIONAL CENTERS WERE TRYING TO BRING MORE TRANSPARENCY THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT. WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING IN KERN COUNTY. AND THAT TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT AND WITH THE MOTION AND THE SECOND I APPRECIATE THAT FOR MY COLLEAGUES ALL. HOW DEFERRED TO THE TESTIMONY THANK YOU? MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ROBERT HARRIS ON THE HALF ELF'S YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA -- THE BILL IS PRETTY CLEAR AND SIMPLE IT DOES IT DOES TWO THINGS ONE IT SAYS. THAT PEOPLE WHO GET PUBLIC MONEY EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NONPROFIT SHOULD POST THAT ON THE WEBSITE YEAH IT'S PEOPLE SAY WELL WE DON'T NEED THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE A HIGH IRS FORM MY NINE NINE AND WE HAVE TO POST THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND THOSE I DON'T THINK ANY ANY STAFFER OF TALK TO IN THE BUILDING DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FIND ELSEWHERE ST POSTED ON THE WEBSITE IT'S JUST CLEAR AND TRASPARENT. PUBLIC MONEY BEING SPENT. THE SECOND THING IS WE'RE SAYING IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT THAT THE ARE IF RESOURCE CENTERS. ARE GONNA CHANGE OPERATIONS. THAT THE PEOPLE SHOULD JUST. SO SO THAT THE CLIENTS AREN'T HARMED YOU SHOULD RETAIN THE STAFF FOR LONG ENOUGH. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRANSITION HAPPENS AND THE SPOOF WAY THAT DOESN'T HURT THE CLIENTS. WE DO THAT FOR WORKERS AND GROCERY STORES. AND WE DO THAT FOR WORKERS WHO WERE JANITORS. TO NOT DO IT FOR THE CLIENTS IN THE WORKERS AND REGIONAL CENTERS JUST SEEMS WRONG. NOW THAT'S ALL I KNOW I WONDER IF INTRODUCED TO THE CURRENT ROW HOLE WHO IS OUT TWELVE YOUR EMPLOYEE IT TURNED REGIONAL CENTER. GETTING MEAN EVERYONE. I GUESS MY NAME'S KRAMER HOA I AM OF SERVICE COORDINATOR TWELVE YEARS DEREK KERN REGIONAL CENTER. I'M ALSO THE CHAPTER PRESIDENT OF THE UNION THAT IS THERE -- WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT AND RECENTLY THEY HAVE HIRED A NEW SERVICE COORDINATORS. IN THE LAST I WANT TO SAY THREE TO FOUR MONTHS. HOWEVER OUR CASELOADS ARE STILL IN THE HUNDREDS -- WE ARE NOT SEEM AN ME -- FOUND COMING DOWN ON THOSE CASELOADS AND DATA DOES THAT DOES THAT HOW OF HIGH CASELOADS ARE STILL -- WHAT CAN I SAY I? HAVING HARD TIMES. GETTING TO ALL THOSE SERVICES FOR OUR CLIENTS AND THE MAIN THING IS THAT OUR CLIENTS SEPARATE THE FAMILY SUPPER. WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A HUGE TURN AROUND? AND YOU'RE YOU HAVE CLIENTS TO HAVE BEEN WITH THE COURT MADE A FOR OVER. THAT SAY FORTY YEARS DEPEND ON THAT THE AGE OF THE CLIENT. AND THEN TO HAVE SOME ONE BRAND NEW WHO. DOESN'T KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE FAMILY BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN THAT. TIME OF TRANSITION -- IT'S IT TAKES A LOT ON OUR CLIENTS AND FAMILIES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE JUST DON'T WE JUST ON'T WANT TO SEE AND WE WERE AND WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT. SOME I AM HOPING THAT YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS THIS BILL. BECAUSE OF WHAT DEPTH ONLY -- HELPLESS AND HOW BE AND TRANSPARENCY. BUT THEY SAY THEY'RE DOING. WHICH IS NOT ACTUALLY HAPPEN. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL GOING WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING AB WESTLING I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES. AND FIRST OFF JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT REGIONAL CENTERS PROVIDE CARE AND SERVICE COORDINATION TO OVER THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND OUR GOAL IS A SHARED GOAL WITH SCO YOU AS WELL AS WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THAT'S TO SERVE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OFTEN TIMES THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR SOCIETY WELL. THIS BILL AS MISTER HARRIS BRIEFLY STATED WOULD DO A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WOULD REQUIRE POSTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON REGIONAL CENTER WEBSITES. RELATED -- TO COMPENSATION FOR MANAGERIAL STAFF. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES NOTED IN ITS OPPOSITION LETTER THAT EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION REPORTING REQUIREMENT IS BROADER THAN THE IRS REQUIREMENTS FOR OTHER PRIVATE TAX EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS AND IS NOT JUSTIFIED. AND WE AGREE WITH THAT POSITION REGIONAL CENTER WEBSITE ALREADY CONTAIN FULL AUDIT REPORTS. THEY CONTAIN FULL SALARY SCALES AND MUCH MORE ROBUST INFORMATION THAT IS ALREADY REQUIRED FOR MANY NON PROFITS AND AT SOME POINT WE NEED TO SAY THAT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH [inaudible] SECONDLY. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THIS EVENING. IS THAT CONTRACTS FOR REGIONAL CENTERS ARE TERMINATED VERY INFREQUENTLY IN FACT THE LAST TIME THAT WE COULD FIND WAS. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND STATURE IT REQUIRES THAT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES IS TO TERMINATE IT A REGIONAL CENTER CONTRACT. THAT IT FIRST TESTED DETERMINE IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PERSON BEING SERVED BY THE REGIONAL CENTER. SO IT'S NOT DONE FOR CAPRICIOUS ARBITRARY REASONS. AS I NOTED WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMON GROUND WITH SCO YOU AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT IN THIS. IN OUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THEIR FAMILIES IN INFANTS AND TODDLERS AT RISK RECEIVED THE BEST SERVICES POSSIBLE. WE ALSO AGREE WITH. S. YEAH YOU BUT THE DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK FOR REGIONAL CENTERS ARE OVER WORKED AND UNDER COMPENSATED BUT THIS BILL ISN'T THE RIGHT APPROACH TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. REGIONAL CENTERS PROVIDE A VARIETY OF DIRECT SERVICES. INCLUDING SERVICE COORDINATION INTAKE CLINICAL SERVICES BUT THEY ALSO PROVIDE A LOT OF INDIRECT SERVICES. INSURING PROVIDER MATCHING QUALITY ASSURANCE AND PAYING BILLS FOR CONTRACTED SERVICE PROVIDERS. ALL OF THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN IN A STABLE ORGANIZATION AND A STABLE ORGANIZATION IS BETTER FOR CLIENTS FAMILIES STAFF AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. THANK YOU CAN YOU WRAP UP YOUR COMMENTS I WOULD. THIS BILL WOULD PLACE SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE STATE'S AUTHORITY TO CONTRACT FOR SUCCESSOR SERVICES. AND WOULD HAMPER THE SUCCESSOR AND IN SHORT TIE THEIR HANDS. WE AGREE AS A NOTED WITH S. YEAH YOU THAT THERE ARE NEEDS TO ADDRESS S. THAT THERE ARE NEEDS TO ADDRESS OPERATIONS FUNDING FOR REGIONAL CENTERS. BUT REGIONAL CENTER FUNDING IS BASED ON CASELOADS AND BASED ON A FORMULA BASED ON THAT. AND SO AS MISS ROWBOAT NOTED. CASELOADS IN THE HUNDREDS SOME OF THAT ARISES FROM [inaudible] HOME. FROM DIFFICULTIES IN REGIONAL CENTER STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT TO PAY STAFF IN THE SIZE OF CASELOADS AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS. THAT WHEN WE ALL WORK TOGETHER SUCH AS IN THE ABX TO ONE STATUTE FROM A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. THAT WE WERE ABLE TO A FINAL SIGNIFICANT MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM AND ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION FOR THE DEDICATED EMPLOYEES AND STAFF UP REGIONAL CENTERS AS WELL AS SERVICE PROVIDERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] CAME A SEE I HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND QUESTIONS FROM -- THE MEMBERS [inaudible] MR DEMINT. THE COMMAND SHARE -- THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR I'M THANK YOU SO OF YOUR TESTIMONY FEEL WORK -- ACTUALLY I ALSO SERVED AS A SERVICE COORDINATOR AT A REGIONAL CENTER. ALMANAC HAD THE OPPORTUNITY BOTH SERBS CORNER AND A MANAGER AND I SUPPORT. WHAT THIS BILL IS ASKING ABOUT I HAVE A QUESTION FOR FOR YOU ALL AND FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM ARKA -- BICU. I WAS WONDERING WHAT DROVE THE INTEREST IN THIS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN. I CAN IMAGINE HAS THERE BEEN A PLACE WHERE YOU'VE SEEN THE OPERATIONS CHANGE AND THE REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES WERE ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER AGENCY AS ONE UNDERSTANDS OR SOME. CONTRACTING OUT OR SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT [inaudible] SO. THROUGH THE CHAIR -- LOOK WHAT WE'VE HAD OCCURRED AGAIN CAN. THE A CURRENT REGIONAL CENTER AND THERE'S BEEN. A LOT OF BUT UPSET THERE AND A BAD NOW AUDIT AND BAD OUTCOMES AND THERE'S AND THAT DEPARTMENTS ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS THAT. BUT PART OF THEIR ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS IT. WAS TO BRING IN SOMEONE WHO RAN IN. CENTRAL VALLEY REGIONAL CENTER. WHO WAS ANTI UNION TO TRY AND TALK TO THE UNION ABOUT LOWER AND LOWER AND THEIR WAGES AND THEY AGREED THAT THEY HAVE ACTUALLY DID THAT BUT THAT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE TIME WAS WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE? THE NONPROFIT KERN AND HAND CONTROL OVER THAT. TO THE PRESIDENT REGIONAL CENTER. AND THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT DISTRICTS AND THREATENING PEOPLE LIKE THAT CAUSED HUGE UPSET BOTH IN THE CLIENTS AND IN THE STAFF AND A CO STAFF TURNOVER DID. BEGIN TO OCCUR. SO WE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WRONG WAY TO GO. AND THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THESE THINGS IN A RATIONAL AND SANE MANNER AND OPEN TRANSPARENT MANNER AND SO THE BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT. AND THANK I'M SORRY THAT THAT'S WHY. THAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS I PRETTY MUCH THINK THING IT'S TROUBLED -- PASTURE WITH THIS REGIONAL CENTER THE STATE ACTUALLY CAME AND TRIED TO FIX THAT. AYE THEY BROUGHT IN ANOTHER AGENCY TO HELP ASSIST WITH THAT. THIS LEGISLATION HERE IS TRYING TO SEEK ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY ESPECIALLY BECAUSE TAXPAYER FUNDS ARE BEING USED. TO HELP FIND ALL OF THE DEVELOPMENT CENTERS INCLUDING CURTAINS AND AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS INCREASE AT TRANSPARENCY SO THAT WE CAN HOPEFULLY BE THAT BRIDGE AND THEY COLLABORATE COME TOGETHER. LIKE THE OPPOSITION SAID WHEN PEOPLE COME TOGETHER I THINK GREAT OUTCOMES HAPPEN. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT TRANSPARENCY THAT TRUST ABOUT HOW THE FINANCES ARE WORKING FOR A TROUBLED REGIONAL CENTER? I BELIEVE YOU'RE ON THAT PATH THEY SEE THIS LEGISLATION AS A PATH TOWARDS THOSE ARE ALSO BUT SOLUTION SO THAT WE CAN. SERVE OUR DEVELOPMENT TOTALLY DISABLED COMMITTEE THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION I YOU KNOW I WORKED FOR TWO DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS. THEY ARE VERY LARGE AGENCIES WITH A LOT OF I'M CAPACITY AND I'VE NEVER HEARD. OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES I'M GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT THE BILL IN THAT YOU'VE MADE US AWARE -- YOU KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE EIGHT IT LOOKS LIKE A MERGER THESE ARE PUBLIC RESOURCES AND SO THERE SHOULD BE COMMUNITY MEETINGS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET INPUT. AND TO GET INPUT ON THE SERVICES THAT'S THE WHOLE THING THAT REAL CENTERS BASED ON IS THE PEOPLE SERVE GET TO GIVE HIM PUTS A THANK YOU FOR RAISING IT. MEN CHAIR OF THE SECURITY OF THIS ANYBODY HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT FELT NO SERVICES IF SO CAN WE HEAR FROM THEM TO THE DOES SOME OF THE SOME OVERSIGHT ISSUES THAT. THAT NEED -- TO TO BE PROVIDED IF NOT COULD WE DO DO YOU KNOW STAFF THAT COMMUNICATION SEND THE MESSAGE THAT THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT WE'LL HEAR FROM THEM AT SOME POINT. IN THIS COMMITTEE -- TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON HOW THESE RESOURCES ARE BEING MONITORED IN THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. AND STAFF -- ARE NOT FINDING ITSELF IN THESE VOLATILE SITUATIONS YES ABSOLUTELY THANK AHEAD A CHATTERBOX IN JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION TO OUR TO THE ARGUMENT WAS ENDED UP THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORT. YOU MENTION AB TWO THAT'S WHY I'M THERE WITH THE BILL OF THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL ABSOLUTELY PROUD YOUR SIR -- VERY PROUD THAT THIS LEGISLATURE SOUGHT PROVIDE.% BUT VIET FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES AFTER WHAT HAD BEEN DECADES OF CUTBACKS YEAH I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHERE ARE WE IN OUR CASE MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE I KNOW THAT EVERY TIME THAT WE ARE AT A COMPLIANCE. THAT WE PAY FINES TO I THINK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PIECE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THAT WE ACTUALLY DON'T PAY FEES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR ANY SORT OF FINES -- THAT WE RUN THE RISK ALWAYS OF ANY TIME YOU'RE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH ANY FEDERAL EXPECTATIONS OF IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKING NOTICE OF THAT AND COMING IN AND TAKING CORRECTIVE ACTION. THAT HAPPENED LAST IN THE NINETEEN IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE -- AND AWARE THAT MORNING BUT THAT STILL AND THAT HURTS MY HEART I WAS. A LOT OF YEARS. OF WAR THOUGH -- IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID COME IN AND IT COST THE STATE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE YEARS. WE'RE CURRENTLY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATOR SHORT -- I THINK SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THAT AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS THAT OUR SYSTEM CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN CASELOAD. AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IS THAT FOR EACH CASE MANAGEMENT POSITION THAT'S FUNDED. THERE IT'S BUDGETED -- THERE'S ONLY SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR ABOUT 60% OF A POSITION SO AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO GROW IN IS THE CASELOAD -- OVERALL CASELOAD OF THE STATE CONTINUES TO GROW IN THE SYSTEM WE SAW SOME INITIAL REALLY FROM SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT -- IN THAT YEAR AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT -- NEW. EXPECTATIONS FOR NEW POSITIONS ARE PUTTING ADDITIONAL STRESS ON THE SYSTEM I I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT. ANYTHING THAT'S THE FUNDED IS SORT OF THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU'RE ONLY GETTING 60% OF WHAT YOU NEED. THAT'S THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY I AGREE WITH THAT I GUESS I WOULD JUST ASK THAT IF THERE IS A PLAN. FOR HOW TO GET THE STATE -- TO CLOSE TO A 100% OF COMPLIANCE WE DON'T FIND OURSELVES. POTENTIALLY HAPPEN TO PAY BILLION DOLLARS OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GET LOVE IT THROUGH THE CHAIR THEN WITH THE CHAIRS -- PERMISSION TO ASK THAT YOU ALL WOULD ALSO WORK WITH PDS PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON WHERE THE STAFFING. PLANS ARE TO GET US UP TO A UP TO FULL COMPLIANCE ABSOLUTELY DATE TO THE CHAIR'S OFFICE. CAN I JUST ADD ONE MORE THING AND IF THERE IS NO CURRENT PROPOSAL NOR AM I AWARE OF AN ACTIVE PROPOSAL AT ANY POINT IN THIS PROCESS TO MERGE THOSE TWO REGIONAL CENTERS. I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD AS WELL AS THERE IS ACTUALLY STATUTE BUT IT -- THAT MANDATES THAT CURRENTLY -- CATCHMENT AREA IS COMPRISED OF THOSE THREE COUNTIES THAT IT SERVES ITS THE ONLY REGIONAL CENTER WITH STATUTE TO THAT EFFECT. APPRECIATE CLARIFICATION DOES SALAD THEY'RE EXPERIENCING SOME ORGANIZATIONAL DIFFICULTIES THAN I KNOW THAT ARE TO HAS RESOURCES AND OTHERS THAT THEY NEED TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. SO THE PEOPLE THEY ARE SERVE WELL AND PEOPLE WHO SERVE PEOPLE THERE ALSO WERE SUPPORTING AND THEY HAVE A PERMANENT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR NOW WHO IS PHENOMENAL AND HAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD -- ACTUALLY CAME FROM NORTH BAY REGIONAL CENTER -- SO. WE THINK THINGS ARE ON THE RIGHT FOOTING AT THIS POINT MAKES A CLARIFICATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER THURMAN WILL GO ON AND ON SANDALS UP THAT INFORMATION OVER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE NO. THANK YOU I'M I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY IT BRINGS I'M ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE POTENTIAL TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF CARE AND I THINK THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BILL THE CONTINUITY OF CARE -- FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES -- IN THE RARE INSTANCE SAYS A BAD WORD THE REGIONAL CENTER LOSES THE CONTRACTS THE OPERATIONAL CONTRACT SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. WITH THAT -- LOCAL AND TAKE -- I'M SORRY YOU MAY CLOSE TO SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. CAN CAN YOU CALL THE ROLL PLEASE RUBIO AYE REVEAL AYE DOCTOR CHOI.

EIGHT TWENTY ONE BY SENATOR JACKSON TODAY. THANK YOU. AND WITHOUT EYES SENATOR DELGADO WELCOME [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM HONORED TO PRESENT MY FIRST BILL OF SENATE BILL TEN TWELVE WHICH GIVES CITIES THE ABILITY TO CREATE A HOMELESS MULTI DISCIPLINARY. PERSONNEL TEAM AND M. D.. BUT WHEN A COUNTY ISN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE US SUPPORT WITHIN THE CITY. SO ASSEMBLY BILL TWO TEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER SANTIAGO BECAME LAW INTO DOESN'T SEVENTEEN AND IT GAVE COUNTIES THE SAME ABILITY. TO CREATE HOMELESS A MBTS HOWEVER NOT EVERY COUNTY HAS THE CAPACITY TO CREATE MANAGE AN MBT FOR EVERY CITY WITHIN. FOR EXAMPLE LA COUNTY HAS EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES CITIES WITHIN IT THERE'S NO WAY FOR LA COUNTY TO CREATE AND MANAGE AN MDT FOR EVERY CITY THAT HAS THE NEED. SOME CITIES FOR EXAMPLE ONE AGO OF ABOVE AND BEYOND THE PLAN THAT THE COUNTY HAS OUTLINED. SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO FILL GAPS AND NOT DUPLICATE SERVICES THAT ARE ALREADY THERE.
