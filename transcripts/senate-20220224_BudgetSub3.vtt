BURST OF MEDICAID DIRECTOR- WEEK

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:57.430
WE DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER

00:09:57.496 --> 00:09:58.631
OF HOW MANY HEARING AIDS HAVE

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:00.132
BEEN DISPENSED AT THIS TIME.

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:02.101
GIVEN THE CURRENT CLAIMS LAG SO

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:03.469
I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:05.137
EVALUATE THAT REPORT OUT AS WE

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:06.572
HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OKAY

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:08.507
SO I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:09.709
NOTED HERE FROM SOME OF THE

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:10.843
ADVICE OF THE ADVOCATES REPORTED

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.012
THE LEAST- AND ARE RIGHT UP-

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:15.948
SEVEN I REALIZE THAT. HE SAID

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:18.851
MAY BE CLAIMS LIKE. SO FORTY SIX

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:20.386
ENROLLED HOW MANY SHOULD WE BE

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.021
IN ROLLING I MEAN YOU OBVIOUSLY

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:24.390
WE'VE BUDGETED FUNDS IN THE PAST

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.691
YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST YEAR

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:28.728
ACTUALLY COUPLE YEARS- SO FORTY

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.563
SIX OUT OF HOW MANY- SHOULD HAVE

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:32.498
BEEN ENROLLED ARE ARE ARE WHAT

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:34.767
WAS OUR GOAL FOR ENROLLMENT. IN

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:39.905
THIS PROGRAM. SO I DON'T THINK

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:43.009
WE NECESSARILY HAD A- GOAL FOR

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:44.477
THE PROGRAM JUST TO BE CLEAR I

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:45.511
THINK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:46.779
PROBABLY GET THE INFORMATION OUT

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:48.014
TO PROVIDERS TO BENEFICIARIES

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.582
COMMUNICATE PEOPLE REGARDS THE

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:51.650
ACCESS. I THINK IT'S A HARD ONE

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:52.785
FOR US TO KNOW WHAT OTHER

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.353
INSURANCES ARE AND ARE NOT

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.421
COVERING IN REGARDS TO THE%

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.223
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD. I BE

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:58.991
NEEDING THESE SERVICES I THINK

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:00.760
RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:02.561
COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH

00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:05.364
PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES- IT'S YOU

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:05.998
KNOW THROUGH THE NORMAL

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.900
CHANNELS- AS DIRECTOR BOSS

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:09.769
MENTIONED. OUT TO ENSURE THAT

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:11.303
THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROGRAM

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:11.837
AND THAT THEY COULD TAKE

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:13.506
ADVANTAGE OF THE PROGRAM IF THEY

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:15.207
NEED TO. I'M SO IT'S A IT'S A

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:16.475
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN OUR

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:17.943
NORMAL PROGRAMS WHERE WE HAVE

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.679
ENROLLED POPULATION- AND WE HAVE

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:22.915
SOME MORE. AVAILABILITY AND

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.216
INSIGHT INTO WHO SHOULD BE

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:25.584
ELIGIBLE AND HOW TO GET THAT

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:27.453
WORD OUT SO IT IS A NEW PROGRAM

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.788
WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE GETTING USED

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:29.722
TO IT. I'M SO WE'RE TRYING TO

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:31.824
REALLY I'D YOU KNOW WORK THROUGH

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:32.792
THOSE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:33.759
SO UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:36.028
THAT. A GOAL OR A NUMBER IN

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:38.330
MIND. HELLO MELISSA THIS WAY AT

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:39.899
LEAST TO DEVELOP THAT BUDGETARY

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:41.934
NUMBER BY WE HAVE A CS CASE

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:43.569
PROJECTIONS SUPPORT SOMEONE MUST

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:45.371
HAVE. AT LEAST COME UP WITH A

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:47.440
NUMBER TO SAY. WE ANTICIPATED

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:48.574
THIS IS HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:50.409
IT'S CLEARLY I GUESS WITH FORTY

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:51.210
SIX I ASSUME THAT'S GOING TO

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:52.745
LOWER NUMBER DOES THAT THAT THAT

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:54.780
WAS NOT WHAT WAS ANTICIPATED-

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:56.882
THERE WAS MUST HAVE BEEN SOME.

00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:59.218
ESTIMATE MADE AS TO HOW MANY

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:00.486
PEOPLE I MEAN SOMETIMES ARE

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:01.821
WRONG I GET IT I MEAN I'VE BEEN

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.689
ON BUDGET FOR AWHILE- BUT-

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.491
USUALLY LIKE WHETHER IT'S THIS

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.760
OR YOU KNOW OUR WORLD MEDIC COW

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:09.728
CASELOAD OR- SOCIAL SERVICE CASE

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:11.063
LOAD HOW MANY PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.431
E. I. T. C. I CAN JUST ROLL

00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:13.966
PROGRAM AFTER PROGRAM OVER AND

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:15.968
THAT'S HOW WE DEVELOP A BUDGET-

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:17.903
SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT- AND

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.839
I GUESS IN THE PAST. LAST YEAR-

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:21.574
WHICH IS THE YEAR YOU KNOW WE

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.542
DID BUDGET FUNDS FOR THIS. THERE

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:25.444
MUST HAVE BEEN SOME PROJECTION

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:26.645
EIGHTY FIVE WHETHER IT'S SPEECH

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.414
CS OR BY THE PART OF FINANCE FOR

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:35.387
NUMBER. PEOPLE EXPECTED TO BE

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:36.622
ENROLLED. I WOULD SAY THAT THE

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:37.957
BUDGET DID THIS. MYSTIC HIGHER.

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:39.191
NUMBER INDIVIDUAL. BASED ON JUST

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:43.062
A- OF THIS. WHO BUT- WE COULD. I

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:44.230
THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:47.166
BUDGET ESTIMATE WAS- SITE NEAR

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:48.567
VERY INCREASED IN REGARDS TO

00:12:48.634 --> 00:12:50.169
WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING- I

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:51.570
WOULD NEED TO GO BACK IN. AND

00:12:51.637 --> 00:12:53.472
THEN CONSULT WITH THE TEAM- I

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:55.141
DOCTOR PAN AND HAPPY TO OFF LINE

00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:56.408
IN REGARDS TO WHAT WAS ASSUMED

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:57.676
IN THE BUDGET. I DON'T HAVE

00:12:57.743 --> 00:12:59.411
THOSE EXACT NUMBERS IN FRONT OF

00:12:59.478 --> 00:13:00.546
ME I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. IT'S

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.315
TIME I GUESS IN THE TAXI. NOW

00:13:03.382 --> 00:13:04.416
THAT THE MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION

00:13:04.483 --> 00:13:05.851
ACTUALLY IS AND WHAT LAST YEAR

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:06.685
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WHAT THE

00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:08.154
RESULT OF A LOWER BODY FOR THIS

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.556
COMING YEAR. RIGHT SO MAYBE THAT

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.458
WAS MADE BY RENEE REVISED BUT IT

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.126
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW. YEAH

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:15.594

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:21.267

NUMBERS COME UP YOU KNOW HOW

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:06.278
THAT NUMBER WAS DEVELOPED-

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:07.713
BECAUSE- WE CERTAINLY HAVE DATA

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.282

YOU'RE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:49.188
THAT WE- DO ADDITIONAL ANALYTICS

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.757
TO UNDERSTAND- WHAT DROVE TO THE

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:52.958
TO THE SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:55.027
BUT- THAT CLEARLY. LESS THAN

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.228
FIVE YOU KNOW WHAT'S CURRENTLY

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:57.830

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:06.739
NOT WORK IF WE ONLY GOT FORTY

00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:08.574

INSUFFICIENT. AND THAT YOU'RE A

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.580
LOT LIKE WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON

00:32:29.647 --> 00:32:31.282

REASON YOUR PROVIDER NETWORK IS

00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:54.906
INSUFFICIENT. SO I THINK

00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:55.940

ELIGIBLE TO PROVIDE THESE

00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:21.766
SERVICES WERE TRYING TO CLARIFY

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:23.167
THAT BECAUSE THE PROVIDER

00:33:23.234 --> 00:33:25.670
NETWORK IS A LOT LARGER- THAT.

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:28.072

00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:21.426

HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE PERCENT-

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:31.536
THE MEDIC HOW- RATE. SO IT'S NOT

00:34:31.602 --> 00:34:33.805

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:06.204
BASED ON THE ALLOCATION THE

WE FIND THAT THIS ESTIMATE. WELL

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:08.052

ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.396
JUST MENTION WE PROJECTED SLOWER

DISABILITIES WHICH RESULTS IN.

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:31.502
SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS JUST ARE

HIGH RELATIVE COST COMPARED TO

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:37.541
OTHER MEDICAID CASELOADS. WHILE

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:40.177
WE DO. FIND THAT. THE COST OF

00:44:40.244 --> 00:44:41.378
CASES CAN BE SINCERE LOWER THAN

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:43.680
WHAT THAT INCLUDING THE- I TIME

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:45.549
WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING CHANGES.

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:47.217
DUE TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY

00:44:47.284 --> 00:44:48.318
IN THESE ESTIMATES AND WILL

00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:50.954
CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR BUDGET

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:54.191
PROCESS. REGARDING THE MCO TAX

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:55.893
ON FOR OVER A DECADE THE STATE

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:56.860
HAS IMPOSED A TAX ON MANAGED

00:44:56.927 --> 00:44:58.295
CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND USE

00:44:58.362 --> 00:44:59.563
REVENUES TO OFFSET GENERAL AND

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.932
COST OF MEDICAL. TAX GENERATES

AN ANNUAL NATIONAL FOR THE

BENEFIT OF OVER ONE POINT FIVE

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:07.104
BILLION DOLLARS AND IS ONE POINT

00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:07.938
FIVE BILLION INCLUDES FELT CLEAN

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:09.006
OF THE STATE OTHERWISE WOULD NOT

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:10.908
BE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN. THE

00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:12.209
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT

00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:13.877
PROPOSE TO EXTEND THE MCO TAX

00:45:13.944 --> 00:45:15.612
INSTEAD WOULD ALLOW TO EXPIRE

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:17.514
HALFWAY THROUGH TWENTY TWO

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:18.182
TWENTY THREE RESULT IN THE LOSS

00:45:18.248 --> 00:45:19.550
OF ROUGHLY ONE POINT FIVE

00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:24.488
BILLION GENERAL FUND BENEFIT. ON

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:25.689
AN ONGOING BASIS. THE MINISTRY

00:45:25.756 --> 00:45:27.057
HAS NOTED LIKELY. ARE WHICH IS

00:45:27.124 --> 00:45:29.326
EXCUSE. IN MEDICAL MANAGED- DATA

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:32.296
SCHEDULED REQUIREMENT- COULD

00:45:32.362 --> 00:45:33.497
HAVE AN IMPACT AS WELL AS AN

00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:35.399
ANTICIPATED VOLATILITY IN CASE

00:45:35.466 --> 00:45:38.368
THE CALL- WHICH COULD COMPLICATE

00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:40.504
THE RENEWAL OF THE MCO TAX. WE

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:41.605
AGREE THAT THE SCATTERING

00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:43.474
BECOMING CULD COST CHALLENGES.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.842
BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY WOULD BE

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:46.243
TEMPORARY IN NATURE AND BELIEVES

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:47.511
THAT THESE CHALLENGES COULD BE

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:49.580
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ALL. I SAID

00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:50.914
THREE RECOMMEND THREE OPTIONS

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:52.349
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER.

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:53.951
FIRST ELECTRIFICATION WE KNEW

00:45:54.017 --> 00:45:55.285
THE MCO TAX BASED ON THE

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:57.921
EXISTING MODEL. YEAR FOR

00:45:57.988 --> 00:45:58.722
CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY

00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:00.424
THREE. THIS WOULD OVERCOME THE

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:02.126
CHALLENGE OF RETIREMENTS AND THE

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:02.626
CHANGE IN PLANS IS NOT

00:46:02.693 --> 00:46:04.761
ANTICIPATED TO GROW UNTIL TWENTY

00:46:04.828 --> 00:46:06.930
TWENTY FOUR. TWENTY TWENTY FOR

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:08.165
LATER USE THE LEGISLATION WOULD

00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:10.167
NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN IT WOULD

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:15.739
BE. FEASIBLE TO GET INTO ANY

00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:16.840
TAX. OPTION TWO WOULD BE TO

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:18.742
PROVIDE. YEAR WE OFFER. OF THE

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:19.910
TAX CODE IN PLACE BEFORE AND

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:21.311
AFTER THE RIVER GERMAN. WITH

00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:23.914
STRESSED IN BY- GOVERNMENT-

00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:25.749
DRAWING THAT PERIOD. AND A THIRD

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:27.317
OPTION WOULD BE TO- THE NCO TOP

00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:28.919
DID NOT IN YOU AT A LATER. SUCH

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:31.021
AS IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:32.656
TWENTY FIVE. THE STATE HAS A

00:46:32.723 --> 00:46:33.557
BETTER IDEA WHICH INSTILLS WILL

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:39.496
PARTICIPATE IN. MEDICAID MANAGED. CARE IN ONE ROOM AND WILL LOOK

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:41.165
LIKE. REGARDING THE- HOW LOCAL

00:46:41.231 --> 00:46:42.432
SYSTEMS. WE CANNOT CONCERNS

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:48.839
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:50.674
THANK YOU AND- YEAH APPRECIATE

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:53.110
PRESENTATIONS- FEW QUESTIONS ON

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:56.046
BOTH OF THESE ITEMS SO FIRST OF

00:46:56.113 --> 00:46:57.748
ALL I GUESS IN TERMS OF THE

00:46:57.814 --> 00:46:59.149
MONEY TO SAY FIRST OF ALL-

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:01.051
APPRECIATE ELLIE ARE TALKING

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:04.655
ABOUT THE MCO TAX- JUST MENTIONS

00:47:04.721 --> 00:47:07.524
CERTAINLY- MEDIC HAL AS A PLAYER

00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:09.960
IS A LITTLE YELLOW IN PAIR.

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:11.995
WE'VE SPENT YEARS TALKING ABOUT

00:47:12.062 --> 00:47:13.964
THE LOW PAYMENT RATES FOR MEDIC

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:15.632
HAL AND CAUSING ACCESS ISSUES

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:17.367
WELL THERE WAS SOME RELIEF WITH

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:18.869
PROPERTY SIX NINETY ONE THANK

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:21.205
THE GOVERNOR FOR- BACK FILLING

00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:22.873
SOME OF THE PROPERTY SIX BECAUSE

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:24.608
THE BACK OF THE TOBACCO TAXES A

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:26.710
DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE WE LIKE

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:27.644
THE FACT THAT THE DECLINING

00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:29.313
REVENUE SOURCE. AT LEAST IF THAT

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:33.951
MEANS LESS USE OF TOBACCO NOT.

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:34.651
IF IT'S A BECAUSE PEOPLE FOUND

00:47:34.718 --> 00:47:35.953
WAYS TO. FRAGILE YET- THAT TAX

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:37.654
BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO DECREASED

00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:39.456
USE. THEM TO ATTACK THOSE

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:42.226
REPRESENTATIONS MORE STABLE.

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:43.727
FUNDING SOURCE AS WELL AS

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:45.395
SOMEONE WHO'S HAD TO BE IN THE

00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:45.996
LEGISLATURE DURING THE GREAT

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:49.399
RECESSION. AND AND GIVEN THE

00:47:49.466 --> 00:47:52.703
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES. SO

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:54.972
FRANKLY- NOTHING ELSE I COULD

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:56.406
CERTAINLY SEE THE REVENUE BEING

00:47:56.473 --> 00:47:58.041
USED TO IMPROVE ACCESS BY

00:47:58.108 --> 00:48:00.744
RAISING RATES SO THAT. THE TEAM

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:02.279
THAT DID THE RATE OF MEDICAL

00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:03.647
RATES COULD BE THE SAME AS

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:05.582
MEDICARE RATES WHICH SO. MANY

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:06.917
PROVIDERS WILL STILL TELL YOU

00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:09.186
STILL WANT A LOWER PAYERS- BUT

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:11.188
AT LEAST- IT'S IT TO BE

00:48:11.255 --> 00:48:13.090
COMPETITIVE THERE SO I'LL JUST

00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:15.425
PUT A PIN ON THAT- THAT- I'M NOT

00:48:15.492 --> 00:48:16.927
SURE WHY WE'RE GIVING UP ON THE

00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:20.631
MEDIC. THE MCO TAX- AND- AND

00:48:20.697 --> 00:48:21.999
HOPEFULLY NO ONE BEEN SAYS WE

00:48:22.065 --> 00:48:23.100
CAN'T RAISE RATES BECAUSE

00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:24.067
THERE'S NO MONEY BECAUSE WE'VE

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:26.336
JUST DECIDED TO GIVE UP ONE

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:28.405
POINT FIVE BILLION RIGHT THERE-

00:48:28.472 --> 00:48:30.007
I GUESS THAT THAT. SITE SO IT'S

00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:31.842
MORE OF A COMMENT OR QUESTION I

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:34.678
HAVE IS THAT- I APPRECIATE THE

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:36.713
IS THE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.215
THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY

00:48:38.282 --> 00:48:39.683
WHICH ON THE POSITIVE SIDE GIVES

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.652
US A BETTER FEDERAL MATCH. AND

00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:43.587
THE I WENT TO A NEGATIVE SIDE

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:45.088
BUT OF COURSE THE COST SIDE- YOU

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:47.357
KNOW WE HAVE TO RETAIN THE-

00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:49.760
PEOPLE. THAT ARE IN TERMS OF

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:51.028
CONTINUATION MEDIC COW WHICH IS

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.696
ACTUALLY A GOOD THING- SO AND

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.364
THAT THIS- ON THE COST SIDE IT

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:55.732
IS A COST BUT I THINK I THINK

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:57.367
IT'S A IT IS A GOOD POLICY.

00:48:57.434 --> 00:49:03.373
SESSION. A PANDEMIC. BUT- IF THE

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.475
EMERGENCY BECAUSE OF- WHAT DO WE

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:08.779
KNOW. HOW MANY. THAT CASE LOAD

00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:10.280
WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:13.250
CURRENT CASELOAD WOULD END UP.

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:15.585
NOT QUALIFYING ANYMORE IN THIS

00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:16.486
RULING TO STERN ESTIMATE FOR

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:18.889
THAT- SO HOW MANY PEOPLE MIGHT

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:21.792
BE LOSING THE COVERAGE- IF THE

00:49:21.858 --> 00:49:23.293
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENDS THE

. SO HAPPY TO TAKE THIS CASE TO

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:35.072
COOPER- SO WE HAVE BEEN DOING A

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:36.840
LOT OF ANALYTICS IN REGARDS TO

00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:38.675
THE POTENTIAL UPCOMING UNWINDING

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:40.110
OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY

00:49:40.177 --> 00:49:42.179
AND THE REDETERMINATION OF

00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:43.914
WHAT'S CURRENTLY CLOSE TO

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:44.748
FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:47.250
LIVES IN MEDIC HOW- WORD

00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:48.752
ANALYZING IT FROM A NUMBER OF

00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:50.587
WAYS INCLUDING ON HOW MANY OF

00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:51.988

WHICH IS AROUND THIRTY SIX

00:49:55.592 --> 00:49:56.927
PERCENT. ROCKS SO LOOKING AT

00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:58.628
WAYS TO INCREASE THAT WITH A

00:49:58.695 --> 00:49:59.796
NUMBER OF FACTORS TO ENSURE

00:49:59.863 --> 00:50:02.165
COVERAGE ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL

SURE WHAT TIME WOULD WE HAVE TO

00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:44.728
DESCEND ROLE- THAT WAS OUR

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:45.562
GUIDELINES ON THAT YET FROM THE

FIFTEENTH WHICH WE ACTUALLY

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:12.455
DON'T THINK IT IS LIKELY BASED

00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:13.690
ON WHAT WE'RE HEARING RIGHT NOW

00:53:13.757 --> 00:53:15.792
BUT- IF IT DID. THAT MEANS THAT

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:17.360

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.394
IT'S A SUDDEN DROP IN REVENUE

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:32.996
BUT IT DECLINED REVENUE DURING

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:34.631
THE- CONTRACT TIME RIGHT

00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:36.399
BECAUSE- IT DO POPULATIONS

00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:39.536
DECREASED RIGHT. NOW AND- AND BE

00:55:39.602 --> 00:55:41.538
SURE THAT- WE DO BECAUSE OF THAT

00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:42.972
WE DON'T SEE EITHER DISRUPTIONS

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:44.574
IN SERVICES OR OTHER TYPES OF

00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:46.409
THINGS- AND THAT THEY'RE

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:48.178
PLANNING FOR A- POTENTIAL

00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:49.713
DECLINE. YOU KNOW THE CLIENT AND

00:55:49.779 --> 00:55:51.781
REVENUE ESSENTIALLY RIGHT- THAT-

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:52.816
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN IT

00:55:52.882 --> 00:55:55.385
WILL HAPPEN- BUT- THAT. CAN BE

00:55:55.452 --> 00:56:00.623
ANTICIPATED. AT SOME POINT IT

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:01.291
WILL HAPPEN CORRECT. I AGREE

00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:01.991
THAT'S WHY WANTING TO MANAGED

00:56:02.058 --> 00:56:03.593
CARE PLANS TO BE OF OUR BIG.

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:04.728
PART AS MOVE. WITH THIS PLAN

00:56:04.794 --> 00:56:05.695
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT AT STAKE

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:07.864
RIGHT IN REGARDS TO MAKING SURE

00:56:07.931 --> 00:56:08.965
ANYONE WHO NEEDS TO STAY IN

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.767
MEDIC HAL. IS BEING RE

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:12.736
DETERMINED AND- AND CAN'T

00:56:12.802 --> 00:56:14.437
CONTINUE THAT COVERAGE WE DON'T

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:16.439
WANT TO HAVE CHARMER PEOPLE DROP

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:17.540
OFF. FOR QUITE A FEW MONTHS AND

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:18.508
COME BACK ON IT IS VERY

00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:19.709
DESTRUCTIVE FOR MANAGED CARE

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:21.478
PLANS FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS

00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:22.979

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:24.848
BE A KEY PARTNER AS WE ROLL OUT

00:56:24.914 --> 00:56:27.851
OUR UPCOMING TOOL KITS- AND

00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:29.252
BUILD OUR COALITION FOR WHAT

00:56:29.319 --> 00:56:33.056
WILL. BE BEFORE US IN TWENTY TWO

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:34.424
AND TWENTY THREE. OKAY AND THEN

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:36.226

THAT'S ABOUT CCS PROGRAM SO I

00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:41.231
UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT YOU SAID

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:43.333

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:55.512
HAPPEN- MOTHER BECAUSE OF THE

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:56.946

AS LIKELY TO DELIVER PREMATURELY

00:57:15.498 --> 00:57:17.333

ONCE THAT AREN'T- ARE WE

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:23.106
ANTICIPATING AN INCREASE

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:25.074
POTENTIALLY OF. THANK YOU-

DEFINITELY RUN ANALYTICS IF IT

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:43.026
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN DEFINITELY

00:57:43.092 --> 00:57:44.027

OF SERVICE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING.

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:12.227

THAT. AND TRY TO SET THE

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:51.860
EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL TAKE

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:53.695
TIME TO BUILD THIS UP ACROSS THE

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:54.663
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HAPPY TO

NOW ROLLING THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:05.820
USED TO BE SPENT ON TIME YOU'RE

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:06.855
TALKING ABOUT THE PLANNING AND

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:08.356
SO FORTH. SO ON THE END HENCE

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:09.924
CARE MANAGEMENT I THINK YOU

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.793
MENTIONED- YOU KNOW CURRENTLY

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.094
GOT NINETY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:22:13.161 --> 01:22:15.030
IN THERE WE HAVE A STILL SORT OF

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:15.563
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO COULD

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:19.467
QUALIFY- SO IS ANYONE WHO FITS

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:21.536
INTO THOSE CATEGORIES QUALIFY

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:24.372
FOR BEHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT OR-

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:26.675
IS THE NUMBER CAST. AT SOME

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:30.211
POINT- IS SO IS IT A TITLE MEANT

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:30.812
OPEN IT OUT SO BASICALLY IT'S

01:22:30.879 --> 01:22:32.681
WHOEVER NEEDS IT. WHO FITS THE

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:35.817
CATEGORIES. QUALIFICATIONS THAT

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:37.952
SET OUT WE'LL GET IT OR IS IT

01:22:38.019 --> 01:22:40.922
LIKE- WELL ACTUALLY- ME TO CAP

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:42.257
OUT A CERTAIN POINT AND THEN

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:44.225
EVEN IF YOU QUALIFY WELL YOU

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:46.561
EITHER HAVE TO WAIT OR- WHATEVER

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:48.129
SO. SO IT'S GOING TO ENHANCE

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:49.631
CARE MANAGER AND YOU DID MENTION

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:51.700
THAT- AND REALIZING THAT PEOPLE

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:52.834
ARE GONNA STAY ON IT FOREVER

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:54.336
NECESSARILY DEPENDS ON WHAT

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:56.237
THEIR SITUATION IS. THAT THAT

01:22:56.304 --> 01:22:58.473
THAT- I WOULD SAY THE GOAL IS

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.175
BUT THE ESTIMATE IS THAT

01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:02.043
EVENTUALLY 5% OF MEDICARE

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:03.478
RECIPIENTS OF PRICE FIT IN THAT

01:23:03.545 --> 01:23:05.914
CATEGORY IS. SO IT DOES NOT

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.850
CLARIFY- HOW MANY PEOPLE DO

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:11.353
EXPECTS TO. THEN GET ENHANCED

01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:14.389
CARE MANAGEMENT AND- IS THAT

01:23:14.456 --> 01:23:17.425
BASED ON NEED OR STARE AT IT OR

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:23.598
IS THERE A CAP. BECAUSE. OF

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:24.466
FINES THIS CALL REASONS. SO IT

01:23:24.532 --> 01:23:26.401
IS A BAD IS THAT ANTI. AS IT

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:27.802
WERE BUILT IN BUT WE CALL CORE

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:29.537
MEDICAID. SO IT IS. THERE'S NOT

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:31.573
A CAP ALLOWED IN THOSE SERVICES

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:33.007
I WAS LONG IF SOMEONE MEETS

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:35.443
BEACH ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:36.411
THERE'S BEEN AN EVALUATION OF

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:38.747
NEED. BASED ON THAT CRITERIA

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:40.081
THERE'S DIFFERENT CRITERIA FOR

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:42.183
EACH OF THE POPULATIONS OF FOCUS

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.918
RIGHT ON THEN THEY WOULD BE

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:44.586
ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THOSE

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:46.087
SERVICES OKAY SO THAT'S IT.

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:48.390
THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR SO AND- I

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:49.524
GUESS WE'RE JUST ROLLING OUT OF

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:51.493
ITS- GIVEN EFFECTIVE OFF LITTLE

01:23:51.559 --> 01:23:52.927
OVER FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE ON

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:54.562
MEDICARE- WE CAN TALK ABOUT.

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:55.697
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CASES AFTER

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:59.200
EMERGENCIES OVER. 5% WOULD MEAN-

01:23:59.267 --> 01:24:00.602
AT AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:24:00.668 --> 01:24:02.537
SO. WE'RE WE'RE ALL OFF TO THE

01:24:02.604 --> 01:24:04.172
START HERE NINETY FIVE THOUSAND

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:07.008
SO. I WOULD MAKE NOTE OF THAT AT

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:09.244
LEAST BUDGET TERRIBLY- YOU KNOW

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:11.346
WE HAVE A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:12.580
EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR- MEDI CAL

01:24:12.647 --> 01:24:15.417
BUDGET R. R. DTS MATHEMATICAL

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:17.585
BUDGET THAT- ACTUALLY THE

01:24:17.652 --> 01:24:18.753
ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT THAT

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.488
IS. ONLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:23.024
MILLION FOR- THIS COMING YEAR

01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:25.760
AND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:26.294
MILLION FOR THAT SO IT'S

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:27.195
ACTUALLY LESS THAN OF. THAT

01:24:27.262 --> 01:24:29.731
FACTION OR PERCENT SO- LOOKING

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:32.834
FOR THAT. AND IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:33.735
WE'RE PUTTING INTO. ANIMALS

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.270
SAYING THAT- THAT ISN'T ENOUGH

01:24:35.336 --> 01:24:37.439
BUT ID- JUST WANT TO KEEP IN

01:24:37.505 --> 01:24:41.676
MIND THAT- SO FAR- IT'S- THERE'S

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:43.678
NO YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LARGE CIVIL

01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:45.480
IT THAT'S A LARGE SUM IN ITSELF

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:47.148
BUT AS A PROPORTION OF TOTAL

01:24:47.215 --> 01:24:53.788
MEDICAL BUDGETS. NOT VERY LARGE-

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:55.690
WHEN COMES TO. SUPPORT AND- ZERO

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.158
AND I KNOW WE'VE BACK WITH DOWN

01:24:57.225 --> 01:24:58.460
THE PLANT THE THAT EACH PLAN

01:24:58.526 --> 01:24:59.661
GETS SITE WHICH YOU SUPPORT ARE

01:24:59.727 --> 01:25:00.695
DOING AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:02.197
IT'S STARTING ROLL OUT HERE-

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:03.665
DIDN'T PARTICULARLY COUNTIES

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:05.567
WHERE THERE'S- MORE. MOBILE PLAN

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:07.001
SO WE HAVE THE CODE IS ONE PLAN

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:08.169
BUT IN THE COUNTIES WHERE

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:10.705
THERE'S MULTIPLE PLANS- IT WENT

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:12.173
WHEN CONCERN WOULD BE IS A

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.211
STATS- OVERTIME. FANS OF FIGURED

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:17.879
OUT CERTAIN OF THE COMMUNITY

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:20.381
SUPPORTS MAY TEND TO ATTRACT A

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:22.484
CERTAIN CASE MIX VERSUS OTHERS.

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:26.454
AND IS THERE GOING TO BE. FROM

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:28.323
THE H. C. S. PERSPECTIVE-

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:30.458
MONITORING OF THAT AND MONTINI

01:25:30.525 --> 01:25:33.661
SUCH IS THE CASE MIX OF. PLANS

01:25:33.728 --> 01:25:35.063
GIVEN WHAT COMMITTEE SUPPORTS

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:37.265
THEIR THEIR WILLING TO OFFER AND

01:25:37.332 --> 01:25:39.934
PROVIDE AND PERHAPS EVEN MAKING

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:42.270
ADJUSTMENTS TO- PAYMENT RATES

01:25:42.337 --> 01:25:43.638
THIS PLAN SO THAT WE DON'T

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:45.807
DISADVANTAGE. I DON'T HAVE PLANS

01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:46.975
CHOOSING NOT TO DO CAN YOU

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:48.643
SUPPORT IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE

01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:51.212
THEY REALIZE THAT. CAUSES THEM

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:52.981
TO ATTRACT AN ADVERSE CASE MIX.

01:25:53.047 --> 01:25:54.849
AND AND PUT THEM AT THE SCHOOL

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:56.851
DISADVANTAGE. SO IS THERE GOING

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:59.087
TO BE MONITORING OF CASE MIX AND

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:00.455
THEN PLANT SPECIALTY MULTI

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:01.289
PLANNED COUNTIES WERE

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:02.891
ESSENTIALLY PEOPLE GET TO CHOOSE

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:03.992
I GET THOUGH THIS PLAN VERSES

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:07.495
THAT PLANTS. RIGHT I MEAN IT

01:26:07.562 --> 01:26:08.730
BECAUSE- THEY GOT THE ONE

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:10.532
PLANNED SO WE'RE SO WE'RE ABOUT

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:11.699
THAT. ALTHOUGH I THINK WE GET TO

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:12.767
PUT MIGHT ABOUT SIMPLICITY.

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:13.935
WHERE THAT MIGHT NOT BE EXACTLY

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:16.337
TRUE. BUT SO WE MONTREAT CHASE

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:18.439
MAKES- THAT MIGHT BE INFLUENCED

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:20.975
BY. A DECISION BY PLANS OFFER

01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:23.111
CERTAIN COMMUNITY SUPPORTS BUT

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:25.813
NOT OTHERS. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.715
GOAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:28.616
ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE GONNA

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:31.553
BENCHLEY- COVER. UP ANY SPORTS

01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:33.288
NO I AGREE WITH YOU.

01:26:33.354 --> 01:26:34.589
UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T REQUIRE THAT

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:38.760
YES I'D LIKE TO BUT I THINK WE

01:26:38.826 --> 01:26:39.561
BOTH TALKED ABOUT WE CAN'T DO

01:26:39.627 --> 01:26:41.396
THAT YET. I AGREE. BUT WHAT I

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:41.930
WOULD SAY IS YES WE ARE

01:26:41.996 --> 01:26:42.897
DEFINITELY LOOKING AT CASE MIX

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:44.699
AND ACUITY IS A PART OF IT IN

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:46.067
FACT WE ARE STARTING TO REALLY

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:48.002
WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND- CHANGES

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:49.537
THAT WE ARE ANTICIPATING. IN

01:26:49.604 --> 01:26:51.339
REGARDS TO MANAGED CARE PLANS.

01:26:51.406 --> 01:26:53.441
ALREADY BUILDING AS YOU KNOW-

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:54.609
STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:56.444
WILL ALSO BE INCLUDING A QUALITY

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:58.346
INTO OUR OUR RATES. ON THE

01:26:58.413 --> 01:26:59.714
MEDICARE PLAN SITE IN ONE OF THE

01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:00.682
BIG THINGS THAT WERE ALSO HAVING

01:27:00.748 --> 01:27:02.750
CONVERSATIONS WITH. ON UP WITH

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:03.718
MANAGED CARE PLANS IS THAT

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:05.587
ACUITY FACTOR A MORE COMPLEX

01:27:05.653 --> 01:27:08.022
PATIENTS THE CASE MAKES- AS

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:09.457
BEING A PART OF OUR ANNUAL RATE

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:10.992
SETTING PROCESS AND SO. ON THE

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:12.093
SHORT ANSWER IS YES WE WILL BE

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.861
TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT OKAY

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:15.697
YEAH AGAIN I'D I'D- I JUST DON'T

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:16.631
WANT CERTAIN COMMUTE SPORTS

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:18.366
BEING DROPPED OFF BY PLANS

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:20.868
BECAUSE- AND BECAUSE THERE IS.

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:21.703
BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'LL

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:23.538
BE DISADVANTAGE THE TACTIC

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:24.706
THIRTY CEMEX WILL BE.

01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:27.008
DISADVANTAGED THE OTHER THE

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:29.110
OTHER THING I HAVE TO BRING UP

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:31.112
BECAUSE IT INVOLVES MY DISTRICT-

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:34.148
IN THE TRANSITION- FOR THE-

01:27:34.215 --> 01:27:35.183
BETWEEN FEE FOR SERVICE AND

01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:37.752
MANAGED CARE- AND- TERMS OF

01:27:37.819 --> 01:27:38.553

SERVICES- THE- BUT IN A WAY

01:27:42.056 --> 01:27:43.491
THAT'S- ONE OF THE ISSUES IS IN

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:45.460
JULY TWENTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY

01:27:45.526 --> 01:27:46.194
THREE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

THAT WOULD PLEASE SEE THE SPOTS

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:49.330
THE KAISER BEING TRANSFERRED TO.

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:52.000
SOLANO SACRAMENTO COUNTIES AND-

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:53.468
UNDERSTAND THERE'S US THERE'S

01:27:53.534 --> 01:28:00.074
SOME CONCERN AT LEAST. AND BY

01:28:00.141 --> 01:28:00.675

CARE PLANS TO CONTRACT WITH

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:06.554

MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ACROSS

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:23.471
ALL OF THOSE PIECES WITH A

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:25.940
CULTURAL COMPETENCY. LENDS AN

01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:27.842
APPROACH SO THAT IS A PART OF

01:32:27.909 --> 01:32:30.745
THE- THE MEASURES TODAY ARE

01:32:30.811 --> 01:32:31.712
IMMENSE AND TRIED DIFFERENT

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:33.714
THINGS ANYWAY ANYTHING FROM YOU

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:35.249
KNOW EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF

01:32:35.316 --> 01:32:36.550
PROVIDERS THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:32:36.617 --> 01:32:38.819
PROVIDERS. MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:32:38.886 --> 01:32:41.622
ARE SEEING- EQUITY GAP CLOSURE

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:44.759
ACROSS THE AREAS- AND FOR

01:32:44.825 --> 01:32:46.560
EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:47.595
WE ACTUALLY HAD RECORDED IN OUR

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:49.163
INTERIM EVALUATION OF WHOLE

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:50.831
PERSON CARE IS THAT WE WEREN'T

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:52.733
SEEING A PROPORTIONAL NUMBER OF.

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.236
INDIVIDUALS THE PEOPLE OF COLOR

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.804
APPROPRIATELY AND ROLLED INTO

01:32:56.871 --> 01:32:58.139
THOSE PROGRAMS AND SO WE ARE

01:32:58.205 --> 01:33:00.207
WATCHING THAT VERY CLOSELY. WITH

01:33:00.274 --> 01:33:01.776
OUR UTILIZATION PIECES AND WE

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:03.644
HAVE INCENTIVES TIED IN THERE TO

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:05.780
MAKE SURE WE ARE PARTNERING WITH

01:33:05.846 --> 01:33:07.048
THE RIGHT PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:09.050
WE ARE. MEETING ALL OF OUR

01:33:09.116 --> 01:33:10.851
POPULATION'S NEEDS OF AND SO I

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:12.119
THINK THERE'S A NICE BALANCE

01:33:12.186 --> 01:33:13.454
WITH THE WAY WE BUILT THE

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:20.027
INCENTIVES THERE BUT OF COURSE.

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:21.395
OPEN TO OUR IDEAS AS WE BEGIN TO

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:22.830
BUILD. FOR YEAR WELL TO MAKE

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:24.966
SURE THAT WE ARE MEETING ALL OF

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:25.666
THOSE NEEDS RIGHT NOW I AM A

01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:26.701
PRETTY. THAT I THINK THERE'S A

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:27.868
ROLLING OUT TO ME SO. WANTED

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:30.004
THINGS TO IN MY- IS THAT. WE

01:33:30.071 --> 01:33:31.172
YEAH IT'S A NEW FOR THE PLAN TO.

01:33:31.238 --> 01:33:32.940
SO THERE THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:35.309
FIGURE OUT WHO TO PARTNER WITH

01:33:35.376 --> 01:33:36.811
AND SO FORTH- BUT I THINK IT'S

01:33:36.877 --> 01:33:39.647
IMPORTANT THAT A TOO OFTEN-

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:40.982
ORGANIZATIONS A PARTICULARLY

01:33:41.048 --> 01:33:43.718
SERVE- BUT IT'S COMEY'S COLORS

01:33:43.784 --> 01:33:45.920
OR OTHER- MORE DISADVANTAGED

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:47.922
COMMUNITIES. SOMETIMES AS

01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:50.725
ORGANIZATIONS- R. AS MUCH ON THE

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:52.293
RADAR SCREEN SO YOU KNOW MANAGED

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.028
CARE PLANS KIND OF LARGE- WE

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:55.563
ONLY GOT TO GET OUR PATIENTS A

01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:58.032
LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES- THEY'RE

01:33:58.099 --> 01:33:59.066
INTERFACING WITH STATE

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:00.401
GOVERNMENT WHICH OF COURSE YOU

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:02.136
KNOW WE DEAL WITH PUBLIC FUNDS

01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:02.737
SO WE HAVE CERTAIN

01:34:02.803 --> 01:34:03.704
ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES AND

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:04.972
THAT'S- THAT'S- I MEAN THAT'S

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.540

WE'VE ALSO YOU KNOW SAVED A

01:56:27.246 --> 01:56:28.481
LITTLE MONEY FROM THEM SO THAT

THEN THEY'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE

01:56:29.782 --> 01:56:31.351
INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE SO

01:56:31.417 --> 01:56:33.353

HOPING THIS IS GOING TO BE AS

01:56:55.341 --> 01:56:55.808
SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLE FOR

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:56.709

02:40:30.821 --> 02:40:32.155
OUR PERSPECTIVE MORE WORK IS

02:40:32.222 --> 02:40:34.725

02:40:42.099 --> 02:40:42.733
NINE EIGHT EIGHT AN EXCELLENT

02:40:42.799 --> 02:40:44.735
EXAMPLE OF HOW MUCH WE'VE BEEN

02:40:44.801 --> 02:40:46.570
ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN A YEAR BUT

COMPONENT OF THE NINETY EIGHT

02:40:55.312 --> 02:40:57.414

CALL SOMEBODY COME AND SOMEWHERE

02:41:01.818 --> 02:41:03.887
TO GO. BUT THE PROBLEM IN OUR

02:41:03.954 --> 02:41:05.522
VIEW IS THAT THESE ARE ONE TIME

02:41:05.589 --> 02:41:07.257
OR LIMITED TERM INVESTMENTS THAT

02:41:07.324 --> 02:41:08.859

TRUE AND I THINK WHAT ALSO

HAPPENS IN FOR THOSE OF US TO DO

02:48:34.571 --> 02:48:36.372
THIS WORK IT IS A LAYER CAKE OF

02:48:36.439 --> 02:48:37.974
FINANCING. TO GET ANY OF THESE

02:48:38.041 --> 02:48:39.275
PROJECTS- ACTUALLY. IN THE

02:48:39.342 --> 02:48:41.010
GROUND SO. I THINK YOU CAN STILL

02:48:41.077 --> 02:48:42.479
KEEP COUNTY- THERE'S A

02:48:42.545 --> 02:48:44.280
PROGRESSIVE HOUSING MODEL WHICH

02:48:44.347 --> 02:48:46.149
WHICH TALKS ABOUT YOUR HOUSING.

02:48:46.216 --> 02:48:47.817
BUT THERE HAS TO BE EXITS AS

PEOPLE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR

02:48:48.651 --> 02:48:49.886
WITH THEIR TREATMENT PROGRAMS

02:48:49.953 --> 02:48:51.588
YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE TO BE

02:48:51.654 --> 02:48:52.722
PRODUCTION FOCUSED. SO OUR

02:48:52.789 --> 02:48:54.324
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BENEFITTED

02:48:54.390 --> 02:48:55.825
FROM A HUD PROGRAMS AS THOSE

02:48:55.892 --> 02:48:58.094
BONDS AND- THERE'S AN

02:48:58.161 --> 02:48:59.796
OPPORTUNITY HOPEFULLY WITH. WITH

02:48:59.863 --> 02:49:01.698
THIS LEGISLATION TO BRING

02:49:01.764 --> 02:49:03.766
RESOURCES. THAT ARE WILL ALSO

02:49:03.833 --> 02:49:04.834
MEET SOME OF THE GAPS IN

02:49:04.901 --> 02:49:05.902
BRINGING ADDITIONAL PERMANENT

02:49:05.969 --> 02:49:07.637
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ONLINE. SO

02:49:07.704 --> 02:49:10.106
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- IT DOESN'T

02:49:10.173 --> 02:49:11.674
JUST HAVE TO BE THE TYPE OF

02:49:11.741 --> 02:49:12.408
HOUSING THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

02:49:12.475 --> 02:49:14.477

02:49:14.544 --> 02:49:15.578
FROM THE HOUSING PROGRAMS IN

02:49:15.645 --> 02:49:16.779
CALIFORNIA AND THE FEDERAL

02:49:16.846 --> 02:49:18.781
GOVERNMENT. BUT ANY MOVE ANY

02:49:18.848 --> 02:49:20.216
MONEY THAT'S BROUGHT IN THAT WE

CAN ADVOCATE FOR SPECIAL NEEDS

02:49:21.818 --> 02:49:23.653
CONSUMERS. I THINK IT GIVES US

02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:24.921
AN OPPORTUNITY OF A TRAUMA TO A

02:49:24.988 --> 02:49:26.389

ABOUT- YOU KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES

02:49:52.916 --> 02:49:53.983
PEOPLE COME INTO THE SYSTEM

02:49:54.050 --> 02:49:55.118
THROUGH A FIFTY ONE FIFTY WHICH

02:49:55.184 --> 02:49:57.086
IS OF COURSE A CRISIS AND IT'S

02:49:57.153 --> 02:49:59.756
TOO CUTE. HOWEVER WE DON'T HAVE

02:49:59.822 --> 02:50:02.759
A LOT OF- S. A. Q. WAYS INTO OUR

02:50:02.825 --> 02:50:06.296
SYSTEM OFTENTIMES CAL AIM. I

02:50:06.362 --> 02:50:07.463
THINK ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT SO

02:50:07.530 --> 02:50:08.998
YEAH SO WE CAN TREAT CHRONIC

02:50:09.065 --> 02:50:11.634
ISSUES CHRONIC ISSUES AND NOT AS

02:50:11.701 --> 02:50:14.704
AS A CRISIS AND CUTE ISSUE- WHAT

02:50:14.771 --> 02:50:15.939
ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT DO

02:50:16.005 --> 02:50:17.140
YOU SEE CALLUM IS REALLY BEING

02:50:17.206 --> 02:50:19.609
ABLE TO MOVE US AWAY FROM THE

02:50:19.676 --> 02:50:21.444
ACUTE FIFTY ONE FIFTY CRISIS

02:50:21.511 --> 02:50:24.614
INTO THE MORE CARING FOR CHRONIC

02:50:24.681 --> 02:50:28.217
ISSUES. IT SAID REALLY COMPLEX

02:50:28.284 --> 02:50:30.353
QUESTION RIGHT- AND SO I'M VERY

02:50:30.420 --> 02:50:34.857
HOPEFUL. IT'S A COMPLEX QUESTION

02:50:34.924 --> 02:50:36.326
AND SO WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT

02:50:36.392 --> 02:50:39.228
CAL AND WILL ALLOW US TO REALLY

02:50:39.295 --> 02:50:40.797
TRANSFORM THE DELIVERY SYSTEM I

02:50:40.863 --> 02:50:43.232
KNOW THAT SOUNDS BIG AND IN OUR-

02:50:43.299 --> 02:50:44.801
OFFICE RISTIC BUT IT IS

02:50:44.867 --> 02:50:46.169
SOMETHING THAT I DO BELIEVE THE

02:50:46.235 --> 02:50:47.770
ADMINISTRATION HAS INVESTED AND

02:50:47.837 --> 02:50:49.072
WE'RE YOU KNOW INVESTED IN AS

02:50:49.138 --> 02:50:50.406
WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:50:50.473 --> 02:50:52.475
THERE'S CAPACITY- TO MAKE THE

02:50:52.542 --> 02:50:53.443
CHANGES INCLUDING THE

02:50:53.509 --> 02:50:54.911
TRANSFORMATION AND THAT'S WHY

02:50:54.978 --> 02:50:56.145
INVESTMENT IS NEEDED IN KEY

02:50:56.212 --> 02:50:59.015
AREAS. INCLUDED CRISIS SERVICES-

02:50:59.082 --> 02:51:00.617
SO ALSO PREVENTION EARLY

02:51:00.683 --> 02:51:02.952
INTERVENTION WE HAVE TO- INVEST

02:51:03.019 --> 02:51:04.454
ON THE FRONT END AS WELL SO THAT

02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:06.489
WE CAN REALLY STOP THE BLEEDING-

02:51:06.556 --> 02:51:08.324
SO WE REMAIN HOPEFUL- BUT I

02:51:08.391 --> 02:51:10.026
AGREE THERE DOES NEED TO BE MORE

02:51:10.093 --> 02:51:12.395
INVESTMENT- STRATEGICALLY IN

02:51:12.462 --> 02:51:16.366

02:54:27.456 --> 02:54:29.659
SERVICES BUT- IN THE TYPE OF

02:54:29.725 --> 02:54:30.693
ORGANIZATIONS AND FRANKLY I

02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:31.894
THINK WHEN I HEARD THE ANSWER

02:54:31.961 --> 02:54:34.497
FOR THE TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS-

02:54:34.564 --> 02:54:36.265
THEY SOUND LIKE THE USUAL

02:54:36.332 --> 02:54:37.400
CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS USED TO

02:54:37.466 --> 02:54:39.569
WORKING WITH AND NOT AND NOT

02:54:39.635 --> 02:54:41.537
JUST FOR THIS LIFE FOR EXAMPLE.

02:54:41.604 --> 02:54:42.505
I MEAN I MEAN IF YOU'D SEE

02:54:42.572 --> 02:54:45.408
DOCTOR I KNOW R. F. KEYS OFTEN

02:54:45.474 --> 02:54:46.509
TIMES HAVE A LOT OF RELATIONS

02:54:46.576 --> 02:54:47.643
WITH THE COMMUNITY SO THAT'S NOT

02:54:47.710 --> 02:54:49.045
NECESSARILY THE WRONG PARTNER TO

02:54:49.111 --> 02:54:50.947
HAVE TO REACH COMMUNITY BUT- I

02:54:51.013 --> 02:54:56.352
GUESS BEYOND. THE. USUAL

02:54:56.419 --> 02:54:57.086
SUSPECTS I WOULD SAY- ARE. HOW

02:54:57.153 --> 02:54:59.255

ENHANCED CARE MANGEMENT- DC

HELP YEAH WHAT IS THE BIGGEST

02:55:11.367 --> 02:55:11.934
CHALLENGES FOR HEALTH PLANS TO

02:55:12.001 --> 02:55:14.804
DOING THAT- WHAT DO YOU SEE YOUR

02:55:14.871 --> 02:55:15.605
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT

02:55:15.671 --> 02:55:16.572
SHOULD BE IN PLACE WE HEARD FROM

LESSONS ARE LONG POVERTY- IT IS

02:55:19.141 --> 02:55:22.111
PLACE TO ENSURE THAT. THE PEACE

02:55:22.178 --> 02:55:24.947
COMMITTEE SUPPORTS AND THE ECM

02:55:25.014 --> 02:55:26.282
THAT DANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IS

02:55:26.349 --> 02:55:28.417
ACTUALLY REACHING. THE ENTIRETY

02:55:28.484 --> 02:55:29.619
OF THE PROBATE MEDIC COW

02:55:29.685 --> 02:55:33.923
POPULATIONS Y. SE PROPRIO YES I

02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:35.591
MEAN- THE- THE WHAT ONES THAT

02:55:35.658 --> 02:55:36.659
MAY HAVE LANGUAGE ACCESS. TO

02:55:36.726 --> 02:55:38.094
THEY HAVE OTHER ACCESS BARRIERS

02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:39.595
ARE THE ONES WHO ARE IN THE IN

02:55:39.662 --> 02:55:41.530
IN COMMUNITIES WHERE- PERHAPS

02:55:41.597 --> 02:55:43.499
THE COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE IS

02:55:43.566 --> 02:55:46.135
THAT. IT IS MORE IT LET'S PUT IT

02:55:46.202 --> 02:55:47.370
THIS WAY IT'S STRONG BUT

02:55:47.436 --> 02:55:49.171
INFORMAL SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

02:55:49.238 --> 02:55:50.473
YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND

02:55:50.539 --> 02:55:52.575
SOME ORGANIZATION THAT HAS A LOT

02:55:52.642 --> 02:55:54.443
OF FUNDS AND- ACCOUNTANTS WHO

02:55:54.510 --> 02:55:56.112
CAN SPREAD TO THE FINANCIALS BUT

02:55:56.178 --> 02:55:57.780
YET YOU NEED TO PARTNER WITH

02:55:57.847 --> 02:55:58.748
THEM IN CONTACT WITH THEM. YOU

02:55:58.814 --> 02:55:59.548
REALLY DON'T REACH THAT

02:55:59.615 --> 02:56:01.584
COMMUNITY SO WHAT DO YOU WHAT

02:56:01.651 --> 02:56:02.885
WHAT'S APPROACH OUR LOCAL HEALTH

02:56:02.952 --> 02:56:04.921
PLANS PLAN TO TAKE TO. TO INSURE

02:56:04.987 --> 02:56:11.227
THAT WE- THEY CAN CARRY OUT THE-

02:56:11.294 --> 02:56:11.727
ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT

02:56:11.794 --> 02:56:13.462
COMMITTEE SERVICES. THANKS FOR

02:56:13.529 --> 02:56:15.898
THE QUESTION AND- THOUGH YOU'RE

02:56:15.965 --> 02:56:18.134
RIGHT MY REMARKS LARGELY FOCUSED

02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:20.937
ON THE EXISTING CONTRACT IN THAT

02:56:21.003 --> 02:56:22.138
THE NATIONAL COUPLE OF MONTHS OF

02:56:22.204 --> 02:56:24.407
CALAIS MENTAL MEDICATION THAT.

02:56:24.473 --> 02:56:26.409
REALLY DID LARGELY FOCUSED ON

02:56:26.475 --> 02:56:28.344
ENSURING CONTINUITY WITH WHOLE

02:56:28.411 --> 02:56:30.313
PERSON CARE AND THE MEMBERS.

02:56:30.379 --> 02:56:32.715
THAT WERE SERVED BY THE PILOT SO

02:56:32.782 --> 02:56:35.885
BY AND LARGE THOSE WERE COUNTY-

02:56:35.952 --> 02:56:37.820
ASKING AGENCIES WORK CORE PART

02:56:37.887 --> 02:56:39.722
OF HEALTH FROM PROVIDERS. THEY

02:56:39.789 --> 02:56:41.424
WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE.

02:56:41.490 --> 02:56:43.092
SAME PROVIDERS WERE ALSO BROUGHT

02:56:43.159 --> 02:56:45.761
INTO CALAIS IN- THERE ARE

02:56:45.828 --> 02:56:47.663
EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH BETWEEN

02:56:47.730 --> 02:56:49.899
PLANS AND VIDEOS ALREADY. BUT I

02:56:49.966 --> 02:56:52.501
THINK THAT IS- AN AREA WHERE

02:56:52.568 --> 02:56:54.470
THAT WILL GROW OVER THE COMING

02:56:54.537 --> 02:56:56.205
MONTHS AND I THINK. YOU KNOW.

02:56:56.272 --> 02:56:58.741
THAT IS THE FOCUS OF- MANY OF

02:56:58.808 --> 02:57:00.109
THE METRICS IN THE INCENTIVE

02:57:00.176 --> 02:57:01.177
PROGRAM THAT WAS REFERENCED

02:57:01.243 --> 02:57:02.812
EARLIER. THERE ARE SPECIFIC

02:57:02.878 --> 02:57:05.281
MEASURES AROUND- YOU KNOW

02:57:05.348 --> 02:57:07.116
TRAINING AND BRING ON ADDITIONAL

02:57:07.183 --> 02:57:08.884
PROVIDERS AND PROVIDERS THAT

02:57:08.951 --> 02:57:09.719
REPRESENT THE COMMUNITIES THAT

02:57:09.785 --> 02:57:13.456
TEY LIVE IN. AND SO I THINK- I

02:57:13.522 --> 02:57:15.691
THINK THOSE. METRICS WILL REALLY

02:57:15.758 --> 02:57:17.159
SUPPORT BRINGING ON ADDITIONAL

02:57:17.226 --> 02:57:19.762
VIDEOS. SO THE QUESTION ON ABOUT

02:57:19.829 --> 02:57:21.864
WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES. I DO

02:57:21.931 --> 02:57:24.233
THINK PART OF THE REASON THAT

02:57:24.300 --> 02:57:30.072
THAT A CLAIM. IS THAT THESE ARE

02:57:30.139 --> 02:57:31.273
NOT TRADITIONAL. BETTER HALLER

02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:32.842
HELL CARE FOR- AND MANY OF THEM

02:57:32.908 --> 02:57:34.310
AS NEVER CALL. WITH EIGHT BEFORE

02:57:34.377 --> 02:57:36.212
SO I THINK SOME OF THE

02:57:36.278 --> 02:57:37.646
CHALLENGES OR THING THAT ARE TO

02:57:37.713 --> 02:57:39.348
GOING TO TIME TO WORK ON. IS

02:57:39.415 --> 02:57:40.149
REALLY FUN OF THAT THE CORE

02:57:40.216 --> 02:57:41.517
REQUIRE ARE BOTH EASY AND

02:57:41.584 --> 02:57:43.786
COMMUNITY. EVEN JUST

02:57:43.853 --> 02:57:46.122
FUNDAMENTALS OF CLAIM SUBMISSION

02:57:46.188 --> 02:57:48.324
AUSTIN YOU KNOW SURE THAT THAT'S

02:57:48.391 --> 02:57:49.325
NOT A BARRIER CLAIMS AND

02:57:49.392 --> 02:57:51.260
ENCOUNTERS. SOMETIMES THE

02:57:51.327 --> 02:57:53.095
STOPPER ARE EVEN- JUST

02:57:53.162 --> 02:57:55.097
ADMITTING- COCKFIGHT IN A

02:57:55.164 --> 02:57:56.699
SPREADSHEET AND INVOICING AND

02:57:56.766 --> 02:57:58.801
NOT WAIT BEFORE THEY CAN. GAIN

02:57:58.868 --> 02:58:00.169
THE CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE

02:58:00.236 --> 02:58:05.741
TO DO. CLEANING- EDUCATION HOW

02:58:05.808 --> 02:58:07.743
TO SECURELY HANDLE P. I- AND

02:58:07.810 --> 02:58:08.844
THEN ALSO JUST. THE FACT THAT

02:58:08.911 --> 02:58:10.913
THERE ARE SUCH ROBOTS REPORTING

02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:12.081
. THAT IN ITSELF I THINK IS A

02:58:12.148 --> 02:58:14.316
CHALLENGE THOUGH- I THINK THOSE

02:58:14.383 --> 02:58:15.351
ARE NOT INSURMOUNTABLE

02:58:15.418 --> 02:58:16.385
CHALLENGES BUT THEY'RE JUST

02:58:16.452 --> 02:58:17.920
GONNA TAKE TIME TO WORK THROUGH

02:58:17.987 --> 02:58:19.989
AND AGAIN I THINK THE DEFENDANT

02:58:20.056 --> 02:58:21.690
DOLLARS WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL

02:58:21.757 --> 02:58:23.859
THERE. SO I THINK THAT TOUCHES

02:58:23.926 --> 02:58:25.461
ON THE FIRST QUESTION AND THE

02:58:25.528 --> 02:58:25.928
SECOND YOU ASKED ABOUT

02:58:25.995 --> 02:58:27.696
ACCOUNTABILITY. I GUESS I WOULD

02:58:27.763 --> 02:58:29.432
JUST NOTE THAT YOU KNOW THERE

02:58:29.498 --> 02:58:33.069
WAS A ROUTE EIGHT ACTIVITY

02:58:33.135 --> 02:58:34.770
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE

02:58:34.837 --> 02:58:37.006
CIRCULATED LAST FALL AND THAT

02:58:37.073 --> 02:58:39.141
WERE DRAFTED. AND THEY WERE THE

02:58:39.208 --> 02:58:40.576
STAKEHOLDER INPUT PROCESS INTO

02:58:40.643 --> 02:58:42.678
THAT AND NOW THOSE QUARTERLY

02:58:42.745 --> 02:58:43.846
REPORTING METRICS ARE ALL

02:58:43.913 --> 02:58:46.348
POSTED. ONLINE A WHAT PLANS WILL

02:58:46.415 --> 02:58:47.917
BE REPORTING ON A REGULAR BASIS

02:58:47.983 --> 02:58:49.785
IT EACH ASK AND THEN. I'D SAY

02:58:49.852 --> 02:58:51.320
YOU KNOW I HEARD FROM DOCTOR

02:58:51.387 --> 02:58:53.255
COOPER EARLIER ON. THAT THERE

02:58:53.322 --> 02:58:54.990
WILL BE DASHBOARD THAT WILL

02:58:55.057 --> 02:58:56.592
REGULARLY BE COLLECTED SO I DO

02:58:56.659 --> 02:58:57.626
THINK THE MECHANISMS ARE IN

02:58:57.693 --> 02:58:59.095
PLACE AND WE REALIZE THAT THE

02:58:59.161 --> 02:59:00.396
BIG HUGE LEFT IN THAT COMMUNITY

02:59:00.463 --> 02:59:01.831
ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO BE A

02:59:01.897 --> 02:59:04.233
CRITICAL PART OF OUR SUCCESS.

02:59:04.300 --> 02:59:05.167
AND AGAIN IT'S JUST GOING TO

02:59:05.234 --> 02:59:06.635
TAKE TIME AND WORKING ON THAT.

02:59:06.702 --> 02:59:09.839
OKAY SO- IF YOU YOU DID MENTION

02:59:09.905 --> 02:59:12.274
THAT- CERTAINLY PEOPLE ARE

02:59:12.341 --> 02:59:13.876
FAMILIAR WITH FILLING CLAIMS AND

02:59:13.943 --> 02:59:20.149
THAT DOLE NEED TO LEARN. TO THE

02:59:20.216 --> 02:59:23.686
HUNT CLAIMS BUT- NO THE- FIVE

02:59:23.752 --> 02:59:25.754

WE HAVE ENTIRE BILLING TO. I AM

02:59:29.391 --> 02:59:30.659
ALSO SCHOOL PHYSICIAN I KNOW

02:59:30.726 --> 02:59:32.228
EVEN SCHOOLS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY

02:59:32.294 --> 02:59:34.063
LARGE BUREAUCRACIES IN THE CELLS

02:59:34.130 --> 02:59:36.232
OFTENTIMES CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW

02:59:36.298 --> 02:59:39.435

NERVOUS WE SAY WHAT WE HAVE TO

02:59:50.579 --> 02:59:51.647

NINE AND I'M TRYING TO NOT USE

IN ORDER TO CLAIM FOR- IT'S THE

03:00:30.286 --> 03:00:31.720
END OF SPENDING MY MONEY ON

03:00:31.787 --> 03:00:33.856
OVERHEAD FOR THESE SERVICES.

03:00:33.923 --> 03:00:36.192
KNOWING HOW COMPLICATED AND-

03:00:36.258 --> 03:00:38.494
TIME CONSUMING AND BUREAUCRATIC

03:00:38.561 --> 03:00:44.133
CLAIMS PROCESSES HAVE BEEN. FOR

03:00:44.200 --> 03:00:46.368
I MEAN IT DOES. CAN WE TALK A

03:00:46.435 --> 03:00:49.838
LITTLE ABOUT THAT YEAH. SO I

03:00:49.905 --> 03:00:52.374
THINK YOU KNOW. A GOOD KNOWLEDGE

03:00:52.441 --> 03:00:54.076
THAT YOU KNOW IT'S A CHALLENGE

03:00:54.143 --> 03:00:56.245
FOR SMALL PROVIDERS THAT WERE

03:00:56.312 --> 03:00:58.447
CONTRACTED BAND HERE POINT- AND

03:00:58.514 --> 03:00:59.982
REALLY NOT YOU KNOW AN EASY

03:01:00.049 --> 03:01:01.650
PROCESS I THINK THAT I ALSO

03:01:01.717 --> 03:01:03.652
MENTIONED THAT THERE IS. A

03:01:03.719 --> 03:01:06.021
PROCESS BY WHICH PROVIDERS CAN

03:01:06.088 --> 03:01:08.824
FIT MANY MANUAL INVOICES- AND I

03:01:08.891 --> 03:01:09.925
THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN

03:01:09.992 --> 03:01:11.026
THROUGH OTHER SIGNIFICANT

03:01:11.093 --> 03:01:12.828
TRANSITION BEFORE IN MEDIC COW

03:01:12.895 --> 03:01:14.663
WHERE NONTRADITIONAL PROVIDERS

03:01:14.730 --> 03:01:15.931
ARE BROUGHT INTO MANAGED CARE

03:01:15.998 --> 03:01:17.800
NETWORK AND IT DIDN'T. AGAIN I

03:01:17.866 --> 03:01:19.401
DON'T THINK IT'S AN

03:01:19.468 --> 03:01:20.035
INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM AND WHEN

03:01:20.102 --> 03:01:21.570
I WAS TALKING WITH SOME OF THE

03:01:21.637 --> 03:01:23.305
LOCAL PLANS ABOUT KIND OF THEIR

03:01:23.372 --> 03:01:25.007
APPROACH DURING THAT TRANSITION

03:01:25.074 --> 03:01:26.375
I THINK THERE IS AN EFFORT TO

03:01:26.442 --> 03:01:29.011
HAVE AN APPROACH THAT'S NOT- YOU

03:01:29.078 --> 03:01:30.246
KNOW. THE INITIAL RESPONSE AND

03:01:30.312 --> 03:01:32.014
THEN DENYING A CLAIM BECAUSE

03:22:40.815 --> 03:22:42.416
WE'RE DOING THAT NATIONAL STAND

03:22:42.483 --> 03:22:43.851
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

03:22:43.918 --> 03:22:46.420
ENTITIES TO DO. THIS TODAY-

03:22:46.487 --> 03:22:47.722
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE IT

03:22:47.788 --> 03:22:49.557
OTHER STATES HAVE WATCH SIMILAR

03:22:49.624 --> 03:22:51.092
PIECES WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT

03:22:51.158 --> 03:22:52.460
NATIONAL SCANS SO WE CAN FIGURE

03:22:52.527 --> 03:22:53.895
OUT WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS

03:22:53.961 --> 03:22:55.496
SERVICES OUT THERE WILL NEED ALL

03:22:55.563 --> 03:22:57.598
OF OUR NEEDS OR DO WE NEED TO

03:22:57.665 --> 03:22:58.666
DO- AN INTEGRATED MODEL WHERE

03:22:58.733 --> 03:22:59.667
WE'RE KIND OF PULLING A FEW

03:22:59.734 --> 03:23:00.968
PIECES OR IS THERE A VENDOR WHO

03:23:01.035 --> 03:23:02.637
CAN. MEET ALLOF OUR NEEDS WITH

03:23:02.703 --> 03:23:04.038
DIFFERENT MODULES AND SO THAT'S

03:23:04.105 --> 03:23:05.373
CURRENTLY THE RESEARCH THAT

03:23:05.439 --> 03:23:07.241
WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW- IN

03:23:07.308 --> 03:23:08.042
INTERVIEWING AND HAVING

03:23:08.109 --> 03:23:09.810
CONVERSATIONS WITH- SUBJECT

03:23:09.877 --> 03:23:11.946
MATTER EXPERTS IN THIS SPACE-

03:23:12.013 --> 03:23:13.714
AND SO- YOU DON'T HAVE A DIRECT

03:23:13.781 --> 03:23:14.715
ANSWER RIGHT NOW BUT THAT'S THE

03:23:14.782 --> 03:23:16.684
EXACT TYPE OF REVIEW THAT WE ARE

03:23:16.751 --> 03:23:18.319
DOING COMPREHENSIVELY ACROSS

03:23:18.386 --> 03:23:19.954
ACROSS THE NATION RIGHT NOW AND

03:23:20.021 --> 03:23:22.223
- REALLY HELPFUL AND I THINK

03:23:22.290 --> 03:23:23.724
I'VE ASKED THIS BEFORE BUT IT BE

03:23:23.791 --> 03:23:25.960
HELPFUL IN THIS NON TERMS OF

03:23:26.027 --> 03:23:26.794
WHICH WHEN YOU GOT A LICENSE OR

03:23:26.861 --> 03:23:28.629
SOMETHING BUT- IF YOU'RE DOING

03:23:28.696 --> 03:23:30.364
THIS AGAIN SAYING THAT. THESE

03:23:30.431 --> 03:23:31.666
ARE THE EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE

03:23:31.732 --> 03:23:33.901
OUT THERE THAT AT LEAST TWO WERE

03:23:33.968 --> 03:23:35.570
YOU KNOW WE THINK ARE EXAMPLES

03:23:35.636 --> 03:23:37.138
OF WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO RIGHT

03:23:37.204 --> 03:23:38.272
NOW WHETHER YOU END UP LICENSING

03:23:38.339 --> 03:23:39.807
THAT ONE OR SOMETHING ELSE OR

03:23:39.874 --> 03:23:41.509
SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT THAT

03:23:41.576 --> 03:23:43.444
THAT'S THAT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE.

03:23:43.511 --> 03:23:44.145
BECAUSE WE ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT

03:23:44.211 --> 03:23:45.379
THIS PLATFORM WE SEE THE

03:23:45.446 --> 03:23:46.547
PLATFORM IS GOING TO DO X. Y.

03:23:46.614 --> 03:23:48.449
AND Z. BUT IT BE HELPFUL TO SAY

03:23:48.516 --> 03:23:51.052
OKAY IN OUR SKIN. THIS IS THIS

03:23:51.118 --> 03:23:53.387
IS WHAT WE'RE KIND OF LOOKING AT

03:23:53.454 --> 03:23:54.855
YOU KNOW THAT IT'S LIKE OKAY WE

03:23:54.922 --> 03:23:56.624
HAD THERE'S A PLATFORM OUT AND

03:23:56.691 --> 03:23:58.092
YOU KNOW THIS STATE OR THIS

03:23:58.159 --> 03:24:00.461
COUNTRY THAT DOES THIS AND SO.

03:24:00.528 --> 03:24:02.229
THIS IS SOMETHING THIS IS AN

03:24:02.296 --> 03:24:11.405
EXAMPLE. OF HOW IT CAN BE DONE.

03:24:11.472 --> 03:24:12.540
AND HOW WELL IT'S WORKED EIGHT.

03:24:12.607 --> 03:24:14.642
THE IT IS SO IT'S A OF FEEL THE

03:24:14.709 --> 03:24:15.443
- WE THIS PLATFORM. IT'S A

03:24:15.509 --> 03:24:16.777
LITTLE NEBULOUS OUT THERE. ABOUT

03:24:16.844 --> 03:24:17.878
THESE. WHAT IT. GOING TO ME WE

03:24:17.945 --> 03:24:19.413
HAVE A DISK. OF TO THINGS IT'S

03:24:19.480 --> 03:24:21.282
POTENTIALLY GOING TO DO BUT IT'S

03:24:21.349 --> 03:24:22.383
- I'M ALWAYS A LITTLE MORE

03:24:22.450 --> 03:24:24.385
ANXIOUS ABOUT SO. YOU KNOW WE

03:24:24.452 --> 03:24:27.755
HAVE TESTED. EXAMPLES THAT SHOWS

03:24:27.822 --> 03:24:29.457
THAT WE CAN DO THIS AND HOW WELL

03:24:29.523 --> 03:24:31.225
DO THEY ACTUALLY WORK. AS WAS

03:24:31.292 --> 03:24:32.994
WERE ABOUT TO. YOU KNOW AT

03:24:33.060 --> 03:24:34.462
LEAST- BUDGETED TO SPEND TWO

03:24:34.528 --> 03:24:35.963
HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION TWENTY

03:24:36.030 --> 03:24:37.164
TWO TWENTY THREE ON THIS. SO

03:24:37.231 --> 03:24:39.533
IT'S A BIG CHUNK OF MONEY- AND

03:24:39.600 --> 03:24:41.469
AS I THINK KELLY IS SO YOU'RE

03:24:41.535 --> 03:24:43.104
DOING THE SCAN AGAIN THIS IS NOT

03:24:43.170 --> 03:24:44.438
TRYING TO. GUESS WHO YOU'RE

03:24:44.505 --> 03:24:46.107
FINALLY GOT A LICENSE BUT JUST-

03:24:46.173 --> 03:24:47.675
LIKE HEY WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES

03:24:47.742 --> 03:24:49.543
YOU CAN SHARE WITH US TO SAY.

03:24:49.610 --> 03:24:51.278
THAT THE GIVE US A MORE CONCRETE

03:24:51.345 --> 03:24:52.980
EXAMPLES. OF WHAT YOU'RE HOPING

03:24:53.047 --> 03:24:55.316
THE PLATFORMS IT IS ABLE TO DO

03:24:55.383 --> 03:24:56.784
WITH IT WITH THIS TEST WITH AN

03:24:56.851 --> 03:25:01.622
EXAMPLE THAT ACTUALLY. HAS

03:25:01.689 --> 03:25:03.190
DEMONSTRATED- IT WORKS. YES THE

03:25:03.257 --> 03:25:03.891
WE BACK. ALSO LOOKED. AND

03:25:03.958 --> 03:25:06.527
AUSTRIA. HAVE A GOOD MODELS OUT

03:25:06.594 --> 03:25:07.862
THERE WE ACTUALLY MET WITH

03:25:07.928 --> 03:25:11.298
CANADA- AND WHAT THEY PUT UP- I.

03:25:11.365 --> 03:25:13.300
HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM THEM. I

03:25:13.367 --> 03:25:15.102
THINK. OUR CURRENT SCHEDULES

03:25:15.169 --> 03:25:17.004
THERE'S ABOUT OVER YOU KNOW TWO

03:25:17.071 --> 03:25:18.205
HUNDRED DIFFERENT PLATFORMS TO

03:25:18.272 --> 03:25:20.241
DATE- AND WE ARE CURRENTLY

03:25:20.307 --> 03:25:21.809
CATEGORIZING THOSE BY

03:25:21.876 --> 03:25:24.078
CAPABILITY- WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE

03:25:24.145 --> 03:25:25.546
SURE THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON ONES

03:25:25.613 --> 03:25:26.914
THAT ARE FOCUSED ON CHILDREN AND

03:25:26.981 --> 03:25:28.249
YOUTH AND NOT. ALL OF THE

03:25:28.315 --> 03:25:30.051
PLATFORMS HAVE A HISTORY OF. OF

03:25:30.117 --> 03:25:31.886
THAT INTERSECTION AND SO AGREE

03:25:31.952 --> 03:25:33.621
WITH YOU WE WANT TO LEARN FROM

03:25:33.688 --> 03:25:34.422
OTHERS WHO HAVE DONE THIS

03:25:34.488 --> 03:25:36.257
ALREADY. ARE WE ONE OF THAT

03:25:36.323 --> 03:25:37.425
THOSE PIECES AND WE WILL

03:25:37.491 --> 03:25:40.361
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE- ON ON THOSE.

03:25:40.428 --> 03:25:41.829
CONVERSATIONS OKAY AND I THINK

03:25:41.896 --> 03:25:43.330
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO. START

03:25:43.397 --> 03:25:44.899
IDENTIFYING WHICH PLATFORMS I

03:25:44.965 --> 03:25:48.102
PRESUME YOU'RE ENGAGING. LIKE

03:25:48.169 --> 03:25:48.936
THE PART TECHNOLOGY AND OTHERS

03:25:49.003 --> 03:25:51.205
WHO. YOU HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN

03:25:51.272 --> 03:25:52.239
THE MENTAL HEALTH AND PERHAPS

03:25:52.306 --> 03:25:53.974
SYSTEMS OF CARE. ON THE

03:25:54.041 --> 03:25:55.543
TECHNICAL SIDE TO BE SURE WE

03:25:55.609 --> 03:26:00.715
HAVE A PLATFORM THAT GROWS. AND

03:26:00.781 --> 03:26:01.549
EVOLVES AND DOESN'T THAT. THE IT

03:26:01.615 --> 03:26:03.918
JUST GET OUT YOU. THIS FIX AND

03:26:03.984 --> 03:26:06.387
GETS OUT DATE I AGREE IT IS ONE

03:26:06.454 --> 03:26:07.021
OF THE BIGGEST THERE WILL THERE

03:26:07.088 --> 03:26:08.489
WILL BE PHASES TO THE

03:26:08.556 --> 03:26:10.725
IMPLEMENTATION THERE WILL BE NEW

03:26:10.791 --> 03:26:12.460
YOU KNOW FUNCTIONS THAT WILL

03:26:12.526 --> 03:26:13.894
COME OUT LATER WE'LL HAVE TO

03:26:13.961 --> 03:26:15.529
HAVE A MINIMUM SET OF PIECES BUT

03:26:15.596 --> 03:26:16.797
WE AGREE WITH YOU THIS IS AN

03:26:16.864 --> 03:26:18.532
EVOLUTION WHERE WE WILL HAVE TO.

03:26:18.599 --> 03:26:20.067
CONTINUALLY BE EVOLVING AND

03:26:20.134 --> 03:26:22.303
LOOKING AT WHAT IT OFFERS- AND

03:26:22.369 --> 03:26:23.637
SO YOU KNOW WE ARE APPROACHING

03:26:23.704 --> 03:26:25.005
IT WITH THAT SAME FRAME OF MIND

03:26:25.072 --> 03:26:27.208
AS YOU ARE YOUR REFERENCE AND

03:26:27.274 --> 03:26:30.311
THEN OF COURSE- IT USUALLY WHEN

03:26:30.377 --> 03:26:31.912
IT SYSTEMS DON'T WORK IT'S

03:26:31.979 --> 03:26:34.181
ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT

03:26:34.248 --> 03:26:40.121
THAT. THIS WITH THE SYSTEM SO

03:26:40.187 --> 03:26:42.623
AND- THE END USERS FIND THAT THE

03:26:42.690 --> 03:26:44.492
SYSTEM IS NOT VERY FUNCTIONAL

03:26:44.558 --> 03:26:47.394
FOR THEM SO- WELL TO FIGURE OUT

03:26:47.461 --> 03:26:48.763
SO HOPEFULLY YOU ARE ALSO AND

03:26:48.829 --> 03:26:50.531
HOW IS THIS STILL FURTHER DOWN

03:26:50.598 --> 03:26:52.266
THE ROAD BUT- WE'RE GONNA HAVE

03:26:52.333 --> 03:26:53.801
TO ENGAGE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO

03:26:53.868 --> 03:26:56.103
INTERFACE WITH THE SYSTEM

03:26:56.170 --> 03:26:57.671
WHETHER IT'S- PLANS ARE

03:26:57.738 --> 03:26:59.673
PROVIDERS ARE. PATIENTS OR

03:26:59.740 --> 03:27:02.009
PATIENTS FAMILIES AT CETERA TO

03:27:02.076 --> 03:27:04.245
BE SURE THAT THIS. THIS

03:27:04.311 --> 03:27:07.782
PLATFORM. IT IS THE DAY OF THE

03:27:07.848 --> 03:27:09.183
INTERFACES ARE ONES THAT- AND

03:27:09.250 --> 03:27:10.951
MAKE IT YOU KNOW. D. EASY ENOUGH

03:27:11.018 --> 03:27:12.586
TO USE AND IS INVITING FOR

03:27:12.653 --> 03:27:15.890
PEOPLE TO USE OTHERWISE. HELLO

03:27:15.956 --> 03:27:16.991
TO OUR PLATFORM THAT NO ONE USES

03:27:17.057 --> 03:27:18.893
. I AGREE WE FULLY PLAN ON

03:27:18.959 --> 03:27:21.128
ENGAGING WITH- WITH CHILDREN

03:27:21.195 --> 03:27:24.932
YOUTH FAMILIES TO BE. END USER

03:27:24.999 --> 03:27:27.268
I. TESTING FOR US AND INPUT FROM

03:27:27.334 --> 03:27:28.803
BOTH THE BEGINNING DESIGN

03:27:28.869 --> 03:27:30.104
PROCESS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE

03:27:30.171 --> 03:27:31.605
VIRTUAL PLATFORM BUILD THAT IS

03:27:31.672 --> 03:27:33.774
VERY IMPORTANT TO US. WE WANT TO

03:27:33.841 --> 03:27:35.209
MAKE SURE THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING

03:27:35.276 --> 03:27:37.912
TO BE- USEFUL AND HELPFUL FOR

03:27:37.978 --> 03:27:39.480
THEM AND THAT WE WORK OUT SOME

03:27:39.547 --> 03:27:41.348
OF THOSE- JINX- YOU KNOW WITH

03:27:41.415 --> 03:27:43.717
THEIR ODD YOU KNOW FRAME OF MIND

03:27:43.784 --> 03:27:44.985
AT AT THE CORE FOCUS OF WHAT

03:27:45.052 --> 03:27:46.620
WE'RE DOING SO WE AGREE. WITH

03:27:46.687 --> 03:27:47.922
WITH THAT SENTIMENT OKAY ALL

03:27:47.988 --> 03:27:49.523
RIGHT WELL AS I SAID THIS IS THE

03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:52.993
I MEAN THIS PLATFORM IS A MAJOR

03:27:53.060 --> 03:27:54.195
INVESTMENTS- THERE'S BEEN A LOT

03:27:54.261 --> 03:27:58.098
PROMISED FOR THE PLATFORM- AT

03:27:58.165 --> 03:27:59.466
EIGHT EIGHT AM.  LITTLE NERVOUS

03:27:59.533 --> 03:28:02.403
ABOUT THAT- IN THE SENSE THAT I

03:28:02.469 --> 03:28:03.537
JUST WANNA BE SURE WE'RE NOT

03:28:03.604 --> 03:28:06.707
OVER. COMMITTING TO- DESCENDED

03:28:06.774 --> 03:28:07.541
PLATFORM'S GONNA SOLVE ALL THESE

03:28:07.608 --> 03:28:09.009
DIFFERENT PROBLEMS WHICH I KNOW

03:28:09.076 --> 03:28:11.312
YOU'RE NOT. SAYING NECESSARILY

03:28:11.378 --> 03:28:12.780
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO SET

03:28:12.847 --> 03:28:13.914
APPROPRIATE EXPECTATIONS FOR

03:28:13.981 --> 03:28:14.815
WHAT WE CAN GET FROM THE

03:28:14.882 --> 03:28:17.318
PLATFORM. PLAY BUT- I UNDERSTAND

03:28:17.384 --> 03:28:19.320
THE PLATFORM IS SUPPOSED TO TRY

03:28:19.386 --> 03:28:20.120
TO PULL THINKING ON THAT THINGS

03:28:20.187 --> 03:28:23.958
TOGETHER. AND AND I THINK IT'S

03:28:24.024 --> 03:28:24.992
GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO SET

03:28:25.059 --> 03:28:26.760
THE APPROPRIATE EXPECTATIONS AND

03:28:26.827 --> 03:28:29.296
CERTAINLY- UNFORTUNATELY I THINK

03:28:29.363 --> 03:28:32.533
FOR IT PROJECTS I DON'T KNOW I

03:28:32.600 --> 03:28:33.934
MENTIONED THAT TO. THANKS THE

03:28:34.001 --> 03:28:35.202
FOR THE DETAILS IT PRIDE AS WHEN

03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:36.437
THEY WORK WELL THEY DON'T MAKE

03:28:36.503 --> 03:28:37.972
THE NEWS ON THIS DON'T WORK

03:28:38.038 --> 03:28:39.473
THAT'S WHEN THEY MAKE THE NEWS.

03:28:39.540 --> 03:28:43.911
AND SO. WE'D LIKE THIS TO NOT

03:28:43.978 --> 03:28:46.146
MAKE THE NEWS BUT WE WANT

03:28:46.213 --> 03:28:47.181
EVERYONE TO KNOW ABOUT IT LET'S

03:28:47.248 --> 03:28:48.082
PUT IT THAT WAY. THANK YOU I

03:28:48.148 --> 03:28:50.084
AGREE THOSE ARE GREAT PRINCIPLES

03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:53.020
TO EMBRACE WITH. HIS PROJECT-

03:28:53.087 --> 03:28:54.688
AND WE AGREE WE DON'T WANT TO

03:28:54.755 --> 03:28:55.923
OVER PROMISE YOUR I THINK THAT'S

03:28:55.990 --> 03:28:57.524
WHY WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS AND-

03:28:57.591 --> 03:28:58.726
WE'RE TRYING TO TREAD LIGHTLY

03:28:58.792 --> 03:29:00.361
BEFORE WE REALLY KIND OF.

03:29:00.427 --> 03:29:02.029
OUTLINE FOR PEOPLE EXACTLY

03:29:02.096 --> 03:29:04.331
WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN IN THE

03:29:04.398 --> 03:29:05.566
SYSTEM AND WHAT IT CAN DO. IT

03:29:05.633 --> 03:29:07.635
AND REALLY TRY TO. LAY OUT A

03:29:07.701 --> 03:29:09.436
ROAD MAP OF WHAT IT COULD LOOK

03:29:09.503 --> 03:29:11.138
LIKE- OVER MULTIPLE YEARS OF

03:29:11.205 --> 03:29:12.740
VARIOUS FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES

VERY MUCH AND I WILL JUST SAY I

03:36:04.151 --> 03:36:05.419
THINK THE LEGISLATURE VERY-

03:36:05.485 --> 03:36:06.787
INVESTED IN THIS IS IN- WOULD

03:36:06.853 --> 03:36:07.921
REALLY LIKE TO SEE IT HAPPEN

03:36:07.988 --> 03:36:09.923
SOONER THAN LATER SO I WOULD I

03:36:09.990 --> 03:36:12.459
WOULD ASK- DIRECT BOSS IF YOU

03:36:12.526 --> 03:36:14.895
COULD. LOOK AT- SOME OF THE

03:36:14.961 --> 03:36:16.463
SUGGESTIONS AT THE LA- MADE

03:36:16.530 --> 03:36:18.865
ABOUT GETTING THIS EXPEDITED-

03:36:18.932 --> 03:36:20.334
AND THEN PRESENTING THAT TO US

03:36:20.400 --> 03:36:22.869
AT THE LITTLE BIT LATER DATE. AT

03:36:22.936 --> 03:36:24.571
THAT IF WE CAN DO IT OR NOT. OUR

03:36:24.638 --> 03:36:28.975
DEFENSE. YEAH I- FULLY AGREE AND

03:36:29.042 --> 03:36:30.877
I GUESS THAT THAT AND THAT'S

03:36:30.944 --> 03:36:32.079
OBVIOUS RECORD ACTUALLY-

03:36:32.145 --> 03:36:33.947
DIRECTOR BUS YOU MENTIONED THAT

03:36:34.014 --> 03:36:38.752
IN THE TRANSITION. FOR MEDICAL

03:36:38.819 --> 03:36:40.554
INTO SAWS THAT. IT CAN REMIND ME

03:36:40.620 --> 03:36:42.456
WHICH WHICH WHAT THEY HEARD WAS

03:36:42.522 --> 03:36:44.624
THAT WHAT HAPPENED A TIED TAKES

03:36:44.691 --> 03:36:45.926
OVER THE HELLO OVER A WHOLE YEAR

03:36:45.992 --> 03:36:47.427
OR SOMETHING WHERE WE BASICALLY

03:36:47.494 --> 03:36:48.528
SAID WE CAN'T MAKE ANY

03:36:48.595 --> 03:36:51.164
ELIGIBILITY CHANGES AT ALL.

03:36:51.231 --> 03:36:52.799
BECAUSE OF THE TRANSITION THAT I

03:36:52.866 --> 03:36:55.135
HEAR THAT CORRECTLY THE

03:36:55.202 --> 03:36:57.237
MIGRATION- GRACIOUS. NEAR ME

03:36:57.304 --> 03:37:01.375
MMHM YES YES THE MIGRATION

03:37:01.441 --> 03:37:03.543
BEGINS AT. OVER TWENTY TWENTY-

03:37:03.610 --> 03:37:05.779
AND AS A RESULT I'M SAHGAL BEING

03:37:05.846 --> 03:37:07.948
ESSENTIALLY STATED FREEZE- OR

03:37:08.014 --> 03:37:09.249
PROGRAM CHANGES CANNOT BE MADE

03:37:09.316 --> 03:37:10.817
UNTIL WE'RE FULLY MIGRATED

03:37:10.884 --> 03:37:12.853
CALZADA IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY

03:37:12.919 --> 03:37:15.956
THREE. OKAY SO THIS. COOKBOOK I

03:37:16.022 --> 03:37:17.891
MEAN THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO

03:37:17.958 --> 03:37:19.726
KNOW NOT ONLY FOR THIS FOR A LOT

03:37:19.793 --> 03:37:22.396
OF OTHER THNGS SO. YOU'RE

03:37:22.462 --> 03:37:25.265
TELLING ME THAT THE MIGRATION-

03:37:25.332 --> 03:37:27.434
AND AGAIN I KNOW YOU'RE DHS

03:37:27.501 --> 03:37:29.336
DIRECTOR SO I DON'T KNOW IF

03:37:29.403 --> 03:37:31.171
OTHER PROGRAMS ALSO GET AFFECTED

03:37:31.238 --> 03:37:32.506
AS WELL. SO I THINK IT'S FUN FOR

03:37:32.572 --> 03:37:36.009
US TO UNDERSTAND THAT- ETWEEN

03:37:36.076 --> 03:37:38.545
SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO

03:37:38.612 --> 03:37:42.048
OCTOBER TWENTY THREE THERE CAN'T

03:37:42.115 --> 03:37:45.852
BE ANY CHANGES SO WHILE YOU'RE

03:37:45.919 --> 03:37:49.890
DOING THE MIGRATION OF THE- I

03:37:49.956 --> 03:37:51.858
WOULD DEFINITELY DEFER TO THAT-

03:37:51.925 --> 03:37:53.193
OFF THE SYSTEM INTEGRATION IN

03:37:53.260 --> 03:37:55.362
THE SAAS PROJECT- THE SPECIFICS

03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:57.063
BUT THERE ARE WAYS THAT FROM

03:37:57.130 --> 03:37:58.532
THAT TIME LINES OCTOBER TWENTY

03:37:58.598 --> 03:38:00.500
TWENTY TWO YOU AT YEAH AT FIRST

03:38:00.567 --> 03:38:02.102
OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO

03:38:02.169 --> 03:38:02.736
OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND

03:38:02.803 --> 03:38:05.472
THERE ARE WAVES. OF PHASES IN

03:38:05.539 --> 03:38:07.641
OVER THE COUNTIES- AND SO I

03:38:07.707 --> 03:38:09.142
THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING TRYING

03:38:09.209 --> 03:38:10.610
TO LIMIT ANY CHANGES THROUGH

03:38:10.677 --> 03:38:12.145
THAT THAT YOUR PUREED CHIP

03:38:12.212 --> 03:38:13.880
ENSURE STABILITY OF THE OF THE

03:38:13.947 --> 03:38:15.849
HOUSE IS DOWN OKAY ALL RIGHT

03:38:15.916 --> 03:38:17.384
THAT'S WHERE I PAY LESS

03:38:17.451 --> 03:38:18.952
ATTENTION TO IT SYSTEMS. JUST

03:38:19.019 --> 03:38:21.221
LIKE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

03:38:21.288 --> 03:38:22.556
PLATFORM BEFORE OKAY SO I THINK

03:38:22.622 --> 03:38:24.057
YOU'D BE GOOD TO GET CLARITY ON

03:38:24.124 --> 03:38:25.625
THAT BECAUSE AS WE'RE HEARING

03:38:25.692 --> 03:38:27.294
NOT ONLY OF COURSE YOUR AGENCY

03:38:27.360 --> 03:38:33.767
BUT OTHERS- I THINK WE NEED

03:38:33.834 --> 03:38:35.402
CLARITY AS TO- WAS OR MAKE.

03:38:35.469 --> 03:38:36.470
POLICY TO. WERE WE'RE ABLE TO DO

03:38:36.536 --> 03:38:38.138
NOT BECAUSE OF THESE TECHNICAL

03:38:38.205 --> 03:38:39.072
ISSUES AND I GUESS THE OHER

03:38:39.139 --> 03:38:41.408
QUESTION THOUGH IS IT AS MUCH AS

03:38:41.475 --> 03:38:43.844
IT'S NOT IDEAL- MAKE A POLICY

03:38:43.910 --> 03:38:46.012
CHANGE ARE THERE. WELL YOU DON'T

03:38:46.079 --> 03:38:47.280
WANT TO DESTABILIZE THE

03:38:47.347 --> 03:38:49.683
COMPUTERS AND IT AND THAT'S WHAT

03:38:49.749 --> 03:38:52.052
THIS IS BUT OVER A WHOLE YEAR-

03:38:52.118 --> 03:38:52.752
YOU KNOW THERE ARE THINGS ARE

03:38:52.819 --> 03:38:54.454
GONNA HAPPEN RIGHT. BECAUSE IT'S

03:38:54.521 --> 03:38:56.256
NOT DONE THAT OTHER THINGS MAY

03:38:56.323 --> 03:38:57.824
HAPPEN AND SO FORTH WHERE WE

03:38:57.891 --> 03:38:59.926
NEED TO HAVE A POLICY RESPONSE.

03:38:59.993 --> 03:39:03.196
AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT-

03:39:03.263 --> 03:39:04.965
THEY'RE GOING TO BE. I MEAN WE

03:39:05.031 --> 03:39:07.033
CAN'T TELL PEOPLE WELL BECAUSE

03:39:07.100 --> 03:39:07.634
OUR COMPUTERS MOVING WE CAN'T

03:39:07.701 --> 03:39:10.904
HELP YOU. SO IS I MEAN I THINK

03:39:10.971 --> 03:39:12.272
PART OF IT'S ALSO GONNA HAVE TO

03:39:12.339 --> 03:39:13.940
FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT ARE THE

03:39:14.007 --> 03:39:15.141
WORKAROUNDS ARE GOING TO BE

03:39:15.208 --> 03:39:17.511
AVAILABLE. IF WE DO HAVE TO MAKE

03:39:17.577 --> 03:39:21.748
AN URGENT POLICY CHANGE- WELL

03:39:21.815 --> 03:39:22.649
THEY COULD COME. SAYS MAY ME NOT

03:39:22.716 --> 03:39:25.252
BE ABLE TO. I MEAN THAT. DON'T

03:39:25.318 --> 03:39:26.553
UNDERSTAND THAT- TO SIGNIFICANT

03:39:26.620 --> 03:39:31.992
TECHNICAL. BUT. I DON'T WANT TO-

03:39:32.058 --> 03:39:32.826
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE SUFFER FOR

03:39:32.893 --> 03:39:35.662
YOU BECAUSE- BECAUSE- BECAUSE WE

03:39:35.729 --> 03:39:40.166
CAN'T RESPOND. SO SO BUT THAT

03:39:40.233 --> 03:39:42.369
WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE IT'S A THIS

03:39:42.435 --> 03:39:44.237
IS- IT'S FEBRUARY OF TWENTY

03:39:44.304 --> 03:39:45.872
TWENTY TWO WE STILL HAVE. SEVEN

03:39:45.939 --> 03:39:48.708
MONTHS BEFORE. THE SEPTEMBER

03:39:48.775 --> 03:39:49.543
TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND- WE SHOULD

03:39:49.609 --> 03:39:50.844
THINK ABOUT WHAT THINGS WE NEED

03:39:50.911 --> 03:39:52.879
TO. PUT IN PLACE THAT WE CAN PUT

03:39:52.946 --> 03:39:54.014
IN PLACE TO PERHAPS MOVE

03:39:54.080 --> 03:39:56.383
TRANSITIONS FASTER. BEFORE WE

03:39:56.449 --> 03:40:00.554
GET INTO THIS- TECHNICAL WINDOW.

03:40:00.620 --> 03:40:02.255
AS WELL AS WELL SO- WE ARE

03:40:02.322 --> 03:40:04.524
INSTANTLY WE HAVE THIS THIS IS A

03:40:04.591 --> 03:40:08.428
THIS EXPANSION IS. NOT AND OF

03:40:08.495 --> 03:40:09.930
COURSE I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT'S

03:40:09.996 --> 03:40:10.830
EASY. BECAUSE I'M NOT THE ONE

03:40:10.897 --> 03:40:12.599
WHO HAS TO DO THE WORK BUT IT'S

03:40:12.666 --> 03:40:14.034
PRETTY MUCH UNPARALLELED LOOK

03:40:14.100 --> 03:40:15.368
SOMETHING WE'VE DONE BEFORE

03:40:15.435 --> 03:40:16.636
EIGHT WERE YOU DOING IT FOR THE

03:40:16.703 --> 03:40:18.838
OVER. SIX WE ALWAYS VERY KIND OF

03:40:18.905 --> 03:40:21.074
FOR THE- SO WE WOULD THINK THAT

03:40:21.141 --> 03:40:23.243
AT LEAST WE'RE NOT ASKING. THE

03:40:23.310 --> 03:40:24.778
AGENCY TO DO SOMETHING BRAND

03:40:24.844 --> 03:40:27.380
NEW. THE QUESTION IS CAN IS

03:40:27.447 --> 03:40:29.049
THERE A WAY WE CAN DO IT. MORE

03:40:29.115 --> 03:40:30.684
QUICKLY IN A WAY THAT- IF

03:40:30.750 --> 03:40:31.351
THERE'S A TECHNICAL WINDOW THAT

03:40:31.418 --> 03:40:33.687
WE HAVE TO AVOID. THIS IS THERE

03:40:33.753 --> 03:40:38.959
A WAY WE CAN SET OF SYSTEMS.

03:40:39.025 --> 03:40:40.560
THAT CAN- THE- THAT CAN BECOME.

03:40:40.627 --> 03:40:43.063
BEFORE THE- WINDOW. DOWN I GUESS

03:40:43.129 --> 03:40:45.432
BEGINS. I WOULD JUST NOTE THIS

03:40:45.498 --> 03:40:47.133
EXPANSION THREE TIMES WHAT WE

03:40:47.200 --> 03:40:49.336
WILL BE IMPLEMENTING AND- AND

03:40:49.402 --> 03:40:50.837
MADE HER OLDER DAUGHTER

03:40:50.904 --> 03:40:51.605
EXPANSION SO THERE'S ALSO

03:40:51.671 --> 03:40:53.707
NETWORK ADEQUACY AND READ-

03:40:53.773 --> 03:40:54.608
CONVERSATIONS THAT WOULD NEED TO

03:40:54.674 --> 03:40:56.776
HAPPEN I'M IN ADDITION TO THE

03:40:56.843 --> 03:40:57.577
SYSTEM CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE

03:40:57.644 --> 03:40:59.346
DISCUSSED YEAH WELL IT'S THIS

03:40:59.412 --> 03:41:02.649
WAY- YOU KNOW CAN WE GET THE

03:41:02.716 --> 03:41:04.250
SYSTEM STUFF AND I REALIZE THAT

03:41:04.317 --> 03:41:05.719
USUALLY YOU DO THE SYSTEMS AFTER

03:41:05.785 --> 03:41:06.886
YOU HAVE THE AGREEMENTS BUT I

03:41:06.953 --> 03:41:08.455
MEAN IF THEY THINK. YEAH WELL I

03:41:08.521 --> 03:41:09.623
THINK THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING

03:41:09.689 --> 03:41:10.523
THIS FORWARD AND REALLY

03:41:10.590 --> 03:41:11.791
APPRECIATED BUT I ALSO KNOW

03:41:11.858 --> 03:41:13.093
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS DEMAND FOR

03:41:13.159 --> 03:41:14.361
HEALTH CARE RIGHT NOW

03:41:14.427 --> 03:41:15.428
PARTICULARLY WITH A PANDEMIC

03:41:15.495 --> 03:41:18.064
GOING ON- I REALIZE THAT-

03:41:18.131 --> 03:41:19.933
THERE'S OTHERS THAT BUT THERE'S

03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:20.967
A TECHNICAL PROBLEM IS THERE A

03:41:21.034 --> 03:41:25.438
WAY TO AT LEAST GET. THE

03:41:25.505 --> 03:41:26.940
TECHNICAL STUFF TEED UP- SO TO

03:41:27.007 --> 03:41:28.541
PREVENT THE PEOPLE THEY- SET.

03:41:28.608 --> 03:41:30.777
AND THEN- THEN I DON'T WANT TO

03:41:30.844 --> 03:41:31.544
GET SOUND SIMPLER THAN IT

03:41:31.611 --> 03:41:34.047
ACTUALLY IS- IT AND THEN THINK

03:41:34.114 --> 03:41:35.649
ABOUT LIKE WHAT THIS FATHER

03:41:35.715 --> 03:41:37.584
AGREEMENTS NEED TO BE MADE TO

03:41:37.651 --> 03:41:42.355
FINALIZE THIS- SO. ALL RIGHT.

03:41:42.422 --> 03:41:43.823
I'M SURE YOU'LL TRY YOUR BEST

03:41:43.890 --> 03:41:45.325
BUT I THINK WE'RE INTERESTED

03:41:45.392 --> 03:41:47.927
TRYING TO MOVE THIS UP. SENATOR

03:41:47.994 --> 03:41:49.929
NOT. I SEE THE EARLIER WITH HIS

03:41:49.996 --> 03:41:53.667
HAND UP PLEASE GO AHEAD. ON THE

03:41:53.733 --> 03:41:56.870
AMERICAN ON SO. FINAL MORE

03:41:56.936 --> 03:41:58.505
CONTACTS REGARDING THE COUNCIL'S

03:41:58.571 --> 03:41:59.906
IMPLEMENTATION IT'S EIGHTEEN

03:41:59.973 --> 03:42:02.308
COUNTIES THAT WOULD BE MOVED-

03:42:02.375 --> 03:42:05.311
INTO CAL SOLACE BETWEEN OCTOBER

03:42:05.378 --> 03:42:06.012
TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN OCTOBER

03:42:06.079 --> 03:42:08.148
TWENTY TWENTY THREE- IN TERMS OF

03:42:08.214 --> 03:42:09.749
THAT FREEZE IT WOULD NECESSARILY

03:42:09.816 --> 03:42:11.951
MEAN THAT CHANGES COULD HAPPEN

03:42:12.018 --> 03:42:13.319
DURING THAT TIME PERIOD HOWEVER

03:42:13.386 --> 03:42:14.854
IT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN THE

03:42:14.921 --> 03:42:17.757
NEED TO PROCESS THOSE CHANGES ON

03:42:17.824 --> 03:42:19.392
AN ANNUAL BASIS SO ANY CASE

03:42:19.459 --> 03:42:20.694
STUDY IN HOW TO MAKE THE POLICY

03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:22.862
CHANGE MAY BE DONE MANUALLY.

03:42:22.929 --> 03:42:25.165
THIS COULD CREATE- NOT ONLY

03:42:25.231 --> 03:42:26.399
ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD BUT RISKS IN

03:42:26.466 --> 03:42:27.534
TERMS OF ENSURING THAT

03:42:27.600 --> 03:42:29.469
INFORMATION IS ENTERED CORRECTLY

03:42:29.536 --> 03:42:31.971
INTO THE SYSTEM- LATER ON THE

03:42:32.038 --> 03:42:33.740
INTERNET TRANSITION BY THE WAY

03:42:33.807 --> 03:42:35.275
THAT SINCERITY SINCE YOU'RE

03:42:35.341 --> 03:42:36.976
EXPLAINED YEP THAT'S TAKING

03:42:37.043 --> 03:42:38.311
PLACE OVER A YEAR IS THAT

03:42:38.378 --> 03:42:40.046
BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT FORTY

03:42:40.113 --> 03:42:41.381
EIGHTEEN COUNTY IS IT JUST THAT

03:42:41.448 --> 03:42:42.649
BETWEEN THE WHOLE YEARS IT

03:42:42.716 --> 03:42:44.150
BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS CERTAIN

03:42:44.217 --> 03:42:44.984
COUNTIES WILL BE AT CERTAIN

03:42:45.051 --> 03:42:50.623
POINTS IN. THE COUNTIES OF THE

03:42:50.690 --> 03:42:52.425
OTHER POINTS RIGHT- I'M JUST

03:42:52.492 --> 03:42:52.992
WONDERING WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT

03:42:53.059 --> 03:42:55.528
WILL BUY A YEAR OUR OUR A YEAR

03:42:55.595 --> 03:42:57.731
BECAUSE IT WE DO THIS COUNTY FOR

03:42:57.797 --> 03:43:00.433
THE NEXT COUNTY THE NEXT AND SO

03:43:00.500 --> 03:43:02.168
. YES THAT'S CORRECT IT'S A

03:43:02.235 --> 03:43:05.071
REALLY. YEAH HE SAID THIS IS THE

03:43:05.138 --> 03:43:08.508

WHICH IS OUR RE APPLICATION ON

04:10:26.611 --> 04:10:28.146
THEIR RENEWAL DATE ACTUALLY WILL

04:10:28.213 --> 04:10:30.415
BE LONGER SO BASICALLY THERE-

04:10:30.482 --> 04:10:31.950
THEIR COVERAGE ACTUALLY WILL

04:10:32.016 --> 04:10:34.152
ALSO BE LONGER. AND HOW MUCH HOW

04:10:34.219 --> 04:10:35.520

04:10:41.693 --> 04:10:43.762
ORIGINAL NINETY DAY CARE- DURING

ALL CURIOUS WILL ACTUALLY BEGIN

04:10:44.996 --> 04:10:46.698
IN MONTH THREE- BASICALLY

04:10:46.765 --> 04:10:48.400
MEANING THAT THEY'LL STILL HAVE

04:10:48.466 --> 04:10:50.769
TWELVE MONTHS FROM THIRTY. OKAY

04:10:50.835 --> 04:10:52.504
SO JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE LEE

04:10:52.570 --> 04:10:55.240
SAID THAT YOU KNOW THESE USES AN

04:10:55.306 --> 04:11:04.716
AREA- IS THAT RIGHT THERE ON THE

04:11:04.783 --> 04:11:06.451

ALMOST TIME A SIZE TO GET TO

04:11:13.658 --> 04:11:16.628

YOU'RE NOT IN MAY. SO DOES THAT

04:11:21.766 --> 04:11:23.701
MEAN THEY CAN'T GET SEEN OR THAT

04:11:23.768 --> 04:11:25.103
MEAN THE PROVIDER THEREFORE

04:11:25.170 --> 04:11:27.071
DOESN'T GET REIMBURSED- WHAT

04:11:27.138 --> 04:11:29.808
WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT-

04:11:29.874 --> 04:11:31.509

04:13:35.466 --> 04:13:36.501
DEPENDING ON THE PERSON'S

FOUR YES MOST LIKELY YEAH WELL.

04:14:07.265 --> 04:14:08.166
THE MOST LIKELY THEY COULD

AFFORD TO GET SANCTIONS RIGHT

04:14:09.567 --> 04:14:10.768
BECAUSE NOW THEY GET PUT AND

04:14:10.835 --> 04:14:11.669
THEN THEY GOT- WELL WAIT A

04:14:11.736 --> 04:14:13.371
MINUTE WE DON'T TAKE THAT PLAN

04:14:13.438 --> 04:14:14.906

04:14:14.973 --> 04:14:18.076
FORTH SO OKAY WELL. I APPRECIATE

04:14:18.142 --> 04:14:19.344
THE ANSWER IT'S OBVIOUS YOU KNOW

04:14:19.410 --> 04:14:21.245
WE'RE WITH IT THAT WE GOT TO

04:14:21.312 --> 04:14:22.513
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS IN A

04:14:22.580 --> 04:14:23.514
WAY THAT DOESN'T CAUSE YOU KNOW

04:14:23.581 --> 04:14:25.283
DISRUPTIONS ARE PEOPLE NOT BE

04:14:25.350 --> 04:14:29.053
ABLE TO GET CARE- AND LEAVING-

04:14:29.120 --> 04:14:31.389
PATIENTS ARE THERE. ARE PEOPLE

04:14:31.456 --> 04:14:34.425
TAKING CARE OF THE PAIN OKAY-

04:14:34.492 --> 04:14:38.563
SO. THAT THE- STAFF ON ISSUE

04:14:38.630 --> 04:14:40.498
TWELVE AGAIN REPEATED I GUESS I

04:14:40.565 --> 04:14:41.866
WOULD JUST SORT OF MORE OF A

04:14:41.933 --> 04:14:45.269
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE IS THAT-

04:14:45.336 --> 04:14:46.537
YOU KNOW CCP WAS A VERY

04:14:46.604 --> 04:14:48.272
IMPORTANT PROGRAM PARTICULARLY

04:14:48.339 --> 04:14:50.375
SINCE WHEN WE DIDN'T. PROVIDE

04:14:50.441 --> 04:14:52.076
COVERAGE FOR PEOPLE FOR CHILDREN

04:14:52.143 --> 04:14:53.878
OF UNDOCUMENTED- WHEN OUR

04:14:53.945 --> 04:14:55.480
MEDICAL RATES ARE MUCH LOWER

04:14:55.546 --> 04:14:57.448
AND- DID AND ACTUALLY HAD MORE

04:14:57.515 --> 04:14:58.783
POSITIONS WHEN HE TAKES EACH D.

04:14:58.850 --> 04:15:01.119
P. AND SO FORTH. AND THIS THIS

04:15:01.185 --> 04:15:02.754
IS A WAY TO HELP ACTUALLY

04:15:02.820 --> 04:15:05.456
IMPROVE ACCESS SO CERTAINLY

04:15:05.523 --> 04:15:08.626
UNDERSTAND WHY- NOW BUT I ALSO

04:15:08.693 --> 04:15:09.794
REMINDER THAT- WE NEED TO BE

04:15:09.861 --> 04:15:11.596
SURE. THAT THE OTHER THINGS WE

04:15:11.663 --> 04:15:12.864
PUT IN PLACE WE CONTINUE THIS

04:15:12.930 --> 04:15:14.265
POLICY CERTAINLY KNOWS DON'T SEE

04:15:14.332 --> 04:15:15.867
THE CHANGE HAPPENING ANYWHERE IN

04:15:15.933 --> 04:15:17.635
HORIZON BUT- JUST WANTING

04:15:17.702 --> 04:15:18.670
KNOWLEDGE THE HISTORICAL ROLE

04:15:18.736 --> 04:15:25.910
CCPS. PLAYED AS WE'RE PHASING IT

04:15:25.977 --> 04:15:27.445
OUT. ISSUE THIRTEEN SOUNDS-

04:15:27.512 --> 04:15:30.248
ISSUE FOR. MEDIC OR AND WITH THE

04:15:30.314 --> 04:15:30.782
- THE FREESHEET TOWARD THE

04:15:30.848 --> 04:15:32.917
DIRECTOR SAID I GUESS- YOU KNOW

04:15:32.984 --> 04:15:35.653
JUST. I DO HAVE TO SAY FOR THE

04:15:35.720 --> 04:15:38.289
RECORD HERE- THAT- YOU KNOW THE

04:15:38.356 --> 04:15:40.124
ROLLOUT JANUARY FIRST DID NOT GO

04:15:40.191 --> 04:15:42.560
WELL- YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUES

04:15:42.627 --> 04:15:44.495
AND- OUR DISTRICT OFFICES ARE

04:15:44.562 --> 04:15:47.398
HEARING ABOUT THAT- CERTAINLY

04:15:47.465 --> 04:15:49.734
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE- TRYING

04:15:49.801 --> 04:15:50.835
YOU KNOW TRYING TO DRESS MANY OF

04:15:50.902 --> 04:15:53.071
THESE THINGS- AS AS THE ROLLOUTS

04:15:53.137 --> 04:15:54.639
CONTINUING I THINK IT'S

04:15:54.706 --> 04:15:56.507
IMPORTANT THAT IF. FOR SOME

04:15:56.574 --> 04:15:58.576
REASON- YOU KNOW THERE IS

04:15:58.643 --> 04:16:00.845
INSUFFICIENT STAFF ON PLACE-

04:16:00.912 --> 04:16:03.247
OTHER OTHER REASONS- THEN WE

04:16:03.314 --> 04:16:04.515
NEED TO SLOW DOWN. THE

04:16:04.582 --> 04:16:06.050
TRANSITION SO THAT WE DON'T

04:16:06.117 --> 04:16:07.952
LEAVE PATIENTS HANGING LIKE WE

04:16:08.019 --> 04:16:08.619
DID WHAT WE SAW AT THE BEGINNING

04:16:08.686 --> 04:16:11.689
OF JANUARY- SO THAT THAT MEANS

04:16:11.756 --> 04:16:13.925
THAT- AND I KNOW THAT'S-

04:16:13.991 --> 04:16:14.525
CERTAINLY NOT YOUR INTENTION

04:16:14.592 --> 04:16:16.694
BUT- THAT THE- CERTAINLY SHOULD

04:16:16.761 --> 04:16:18.229
BE DRIVING A TIMELINE THAT THEN

04:16:18.296 --> 04:16:20.231
LEADS TO THE PROBLEMS THAT WE

04:16:20.298 --> 04:16:21.332
SAW THAT HAPPEN ON THE INTERNET

04:16:21.399 --> 04:16:22.834
AGAIN ENGINE ENDED JANUARY

04:16:22.900 --> 04:16:25.169
FRANKLY. I GUESS THE QUESTION I

04:16:25.236 --> 04:16:26.604
DO HAVE TO GET YOU TO TALK ABOUT

04:16:26.671 --> 04:16:28.840
THE REST OF US YOU TALKED ABOUT

04:16:28.906 --> 04:16:29.440
THE DIGITAL STAFFING AND SO

04:16:29.507 --> 04:16:30.775
FORTH THAT MAGELLAN'S BRINGING

04:16:30.842 --> 04:16:37.315
ON BOARD- IS THAT- IT IS. SO I

04:16:37.381 --> 04:16:38.583
DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAVE

04:16:38.649 --> 04:16:40.051
SERVICE CHALLENGES STAFFING

04:16:40.118 --> 04:16:41.686
BEFORE I MEAN IT IS THERE IS%

04:16:41.753 --> 04:16:45.123
THERE A CONTRACT- THAT THEY HAD

04:16:45.189 --> 04:16:48.526
WITH T. H. C. S. I MEAN I GUESS

04:16:48.593 --> 04:16:49.894
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT THE-

04:16:49.961 --> 04:16:51.095
THE DAY CONTRACT FOR THE

04:16:51.162 --> 04:16:53.264
SUFFICIENT STAFFING- AND THAT-

04:16:53.331 --> 04:16:54.665
THERE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

04:16:54.732 --> 04:16:55.967
I DON'T WANT THEM TO CONTINUE TO

04:16:56.033 --> 04:16:57.435
UNDERSTAFFED BECAUSE THEY SAID

04:16:57.502 --> 04:16:59.670
WELL TWO YEAR CONTRACTS FOR A

04:16:59.737 --> 04:17:01.339
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STAFFING AND-

04:17:01.405 --> 04:17:02.673
TURNS OUT WE NEEDED A LOT MORE

04:17:02.740 --> 04:17:05.710
THAN WE DID BEFORE SO- CAN YOU

04:17:05.777 --> 04:17:07.078
CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THAT THAT

04:17:07.145 --> 04:17:08.579
THE TERMS OF THE CAPACITY OF.

04:17:08.646 --> 04:17:10.615
THE CONTRACTOR MAGELLAN TO BAD

LOOK AT REALIGNMENT BROADLY IN A

04:54:14.403 --> 04:54:16.805
REPORT WE CAME OUT WITH- I THINK

04:54:16.872 --> 04:54:19.041
IT WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO.

04:54:19.108 --> 04:54:20.876
NOW WHERE WE SORT OF EXAMINE

04:54:20.943 --> 04:54:23.045
THIS ISSUE YOU SPEAK OF. THE

04:54:23.112 --> 04:54:24.847
FACT THAT REALIGNMENT REVENUES

04:54:24.913 --> 04:54:26.081
AND VEHICLE LICENSE FEES AND

04:54:26.148 --> 04:54:27.483
SALES TAX DON'T NECESSARILY

04:54:27.549 --> 04:54:30.019
TRACK. WITH ANY SORT OF METRIC

04:54:30.085 --> 04:54:32.388
OF MENTAL HEALTH THE MAN WE MADE

04:54:32.454 --> 04:54:33.522

04:54:42.498 --> 04:54:43.365
ISSUE FOR LEGISLATIVE

04:54:43.432 --> 04:54:44.666
CONSIDERATION BUT WE DON'T HAVE

04:54:44.733 --> 04:54:45.667
WE DIDN'T HAVE SORT OF PREPARED

04:54:45.734 --> 04:54:47.236
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT IN THAT

04:54:47.302 --> 04:54:49.538
RECORD AT THAT TIME- WHAT I WILL

04:54:49.605 --> 04:54:52.107
SAY IS THAT OUR OFFICE. NOW IS

04:54:52.174 --> 04:54:55.377
WORKING ON A- SORT OF A PROJECT

04:54:55.444 --> 04:54:56.879
LOOKING AT TWENTY ELEVEN

04:54:56.945 --> 04:54:58.680
REALIGNMENT BROADLY AND SORT OF

04:54:58.747 --> 04:55:00.249
WE DON'T HAVE AN A AN

04:55:00.315 --> 04:55:02.418
ANTICIPATED TIME. FRAME FOR WHEN

04:55:02.484 --> 04:55:03.852
THAT SORT OF REPORT WOULD BE

04:55:03.919 --> 04:55:05.187
RELEASED BY ONE OF THE ISSUES

04:55:05.254 --> 04:55:06.622
THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS SORT

04:55:06.688 --> 04:55:10.025
OF THIS SIMILAR- ISSUE THAT YOU

04:55:10.092 --> 04:55:11.794
RAISE AS FAR AS LIKE THE REVENUE

04:55:11.860 --> 04:55:13.429
STREAMS NOT SORT OF TRACKING

04:55:13.495 --> 04:55:14.630
WITH DEMAND FOR MENTAL HEALTH

04:55:14.696 --> 04:55:15.831
THE OTHER THE OTHER POINT THAT I

04:55:15.898 --> 04:55:17.299
WOULD. RAISE IS THAT THERE'VE

04:55:17.366 --> 04:55:18.967
BEEN A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT

04:55:19.034 --> 04:55:20.736
VERY SIGNIFICANT LIKE POLICY

04:55:20.803 --> 04:55:23.338
CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE

04:55:23.405 --> 04:55:24.039
TWENTY ELEVEN WHICH HAVE SORT OF

04:55:24.106 --> 04:55:29.078
IMPACTED- SORT OF- WHICH MAY

04:55:29.144 --> 04:55:31.346
HAVE SORT OF IMPACTED COUNTY. AT

04:55:31.413 --> 04:55:32.548
LOCAL DEMAND FOR MENTAL HEALTH

04:55:32.614 --> 04:55:33.849
SERVICES SO THERE'S YOU KNOW

04:55:33.916 --> 04:55:35.451
THERE WAS A BIG EXPANSION. UNDER

04:55:35.517 --> 04:55:36.518
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THERE

04:55:36.585 --> 04:55:39.121
HAVE BEEN. CHANGES TO YOU KNOW

04:55:39.188 --> 04:55:42.324
THE STRUCTURE THROUGH WHICH-

04:55:42.391 --> 04:55:42.858
SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES ARE

04:55:42.925 --> 04:55:44.560
PROVIDED THROUGH THE NEW THE

04:55:44.626 --> 04:55:46.095
RELATIVELY NEW ODS SYSTEM AND

04:55:46.161 --> 04:55:48.430
SO- ONE OF THE ISSUES ARE GOING

04:55:48.497 --> 04:55:50.566
TO BE TAKING A LOOK AT IT JUST

04:55:50.632 --> 04:55:55.104
SORT OF THERE. THE. THAT SORT OF

04:55:55.170 --> 04:55:57.139
THESE REVENUES THEY DON'T JUST

04:55:57.206 --> 04:55:58.574
THEY DON'T JUST NOT TRACK SORT

04:55:58.640 --> 04:55:59.508
OF MENTAL HEALTH TO ME AND THEY

04:55:59.575 --> 04:56:00.843
DON'T THEY ALSO DON'T TRACK SORT

04:56:00.909 --> 04:56:02.111
OF SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGES

04:56:02.177 --> 04:56:04.780
THAT MAY OCCUR- AFTER SORT OF

04:56:04.847 --> 04:56:06.448
THE REALIGNMENT DATE AND SO I

04:56:06.515 --> 04:56:08.183
DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A SUPER

04:56:08.250 --> 04:56:09.852
HELPFUL ANSWER FOR YOU I JUST

04:56:09.918 --> 04:56:10.752
WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW IT'S

04:56:10.819 --> 04:56:12.688
SOMETHING THAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT

04:56:12.754 --> 04:56:13.522
IT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK

04:56:13.589 --> 04:56:14.990
INTO IT YEAH AND I THINK THAT

04:56:15.057 --> 04:56:16.959
AND I THINK THAT'S THE POINT

04:56:17.025 --> 04:56:17.593
THAT WE'RE THAT WE'RE WONDERING

04:56:17.659 --> 04:56:18.594
WHY SHOULD WHY SHOULD WE REALLY

04:56:18.660 --> 04:56:19.661
BE LOOKING AT THIS AND SO WE'RE

04:56:19.728 --> 04:56:22.197
GLAD THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

04:56:22.264 --> 04:56:22.965
THAT AND LOOKING AT IT AS WELL

04:56:23.031 --> 04:56:24.099
BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE TRACKED

04:56:24.166 --> 04:56:26.135
SOME KINDA. IT TO SOMETHING. HAD

04:56:26.201 --> 04:56:27.436
GET IN. THE SALES TAX VEHICLE.

04:56:27.503 --> 04:56:28.904
LICENSE FEE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE.

04:56:28.971 --> 04:56:31.773
EXACTLY THAT- BUT ANYWAY I AM

04:56:31.840 --> 04:56:33.075
GLAD YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT. AND I

04:56:33.142 --> 04:56:34.676
THINK WE'LL HAVE A LOT MORE

04:56:34.743 --> 04:56:35.277
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS GOING

04:56:35.344 --> 04:56:38.046
FORWARD. NO NO AND- TODAY I DO

04:56:38.113 --> 04:56:39.515
THINK THAT ALICE IS GONNA BE

04:56:39.581 --> 04:56:42.050
REALLY IMPORTANT. RIGHT AND IN

04:56:42.117 --> 04:56:46.088
FACT- CHEROKEE MEN- IT MEANS.

04:56:46.155 --> 04:56:46.722
THAT I KNOW YOUR LEADERSHIP IN

04:56:46.788 --> 04:56:48.790
MENTAL HEALTH- BUT MAY BE BOLD

04:56:48.857 --> 04:56:50.526
TO. SUGGEST THAT WE WORK WITH

04:56:50.592 --> 04:56:51.827
THE L. A. O. AND CONSIDER AN

04:56:51.894 --> 04:56:53.061
INFORMATIONAL HEARING JUST. YOU

04:56:53.128 --> 04:56:53.896
KNOW WHAT. WE DON'T EVEN NEED

04:56:53.962 --> 04:56:55.230
RECOMMENDATIONS LET'S JUST LOOK

04:56:55.297 --> 04:56:57.733
AT WHAT THE SITUATION IS RIGHT.

04:56:57.799 --> 04:56:59.868
BECAUSE WE HAVE. BOTH THE

04:56:59.935 --> 04:57:01.136
REALIGNMENT MONEY FOR COMMUNITY

04:57:01.203 --> 04:57:03.138
HEALTH WE HAVE PROP SIXTY THREE.

04:57:03.205 --> 04:57:04.873
AND I UNDERSTAND. THAT YOU'RE A

04:57:04.940 --> 04:57:06.375
MAN YOU'RE TAKING A LEADERSHIP

04:57:06.441 --> 04:57:08.177
ROLE LOOKING AT PROP SIXTY

04:57:08.243 --> 04:57:09.978
THREE. HOW THEY COME TOGETHER-

04:57:10.045 --> 04:57:10.879
AND OF COURSE THEY HAVE THEIR

04:57:10.946 --> 04:57:12.981
OWN REQUIREMENTS AND AS YOU SAID

04:57:13.048 --> 04:57:13.749
WE'VE MADE OTHER STRUCTURAL

04:57:13.815 --> 04:57:16.852
CHANGES. AND THE- THIS IS A

04:57:16.919 --> 04:57:17.953
FORMER CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE

04:57:18.020 --> 04:57:18.987
ALSO YOU KNOW. OPENING UP

04:57:19.054 --> 04:57:20.422
REALIGNMENT OF BIG TIME. IS A

04:57:20.489 --> 04:57:22.124
VERY DAUNTING TASK SO IT'S A-

04:57:22.191 --> 04:57:25.427
IT'S A- SO I. WON'T QUITE

04:57:25.494 --> 04:57:28.163
SUGGEST THAT YET. ALTHOUGH I

04:57:28.230 --> 04:57:29.565
THINK I HAVE IT IN THE PAST

04:57:29.631 --> 04:57:30.632
SAYING THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD.

04:57:30.699 --> 04:57:32.067
KIND OF. THINK ABOUT THAT A

04:57:32.134 --> 04:57:33.869
LITTLE BIT BUT- BEFORE ANYONE

04:57:33.936 --> 04:57:35.470
GETS TOO FREAKED OUT HEARING ME

04:57:35.537 --> 04:57:37.306
SAY THAT. RIGHT NOW- BUT AT

04:57:37.372 --> 04:57:39.007
LEAST LET'S. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

04:57:39.074 --> 04:57:42.211
AT WHAT. KIND OF RESOURCES. DO

04:57:42.277 --> 04:57:44.213
WE HAVE IN MENTAL HEALTH. AND

04:57:44.279 --> 04:57:46.582
HOW. IT EXACTLY. SO IT'S NOT

04:57:46.648 --> 04:57:47.983
IT'S A BUILT IN THE PAST AND

04:57:48.050 --> 04:57:49.017
THEN WE HAVE PROGRAM CHANGES AND

04:57:49.084 --> 04:57:50.652
THEN GOING TO THE FUTURE BECAUSE

04:57:50.719 --> 04:57:52.754
OF ITS KIND OF FLAT. REVENUE

04:57:52.821 --> 04:57:59.528
SOURCE WELL. WELL WITH THE

04:57:59.595 --> 04:58:00.162
DEMAND IS GOING UP- WE'RE GONNA

04:58:00.229 --> 04:58:01.430
FIGURE HOW TO CLOSE. GAP RATE

04:58:01.496 --> 04:58:02.731
AND OF COURSE PROP SIXTY THREE

04:58:02.798 --> 04:58:03.799
WE HAVE DEAL WITH OF ALL. RIGHT

04:58:03.865 --> 04:58:05.000
BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT MAIN

04:58:05.067 --> 04:58:06.401
REVENUE COMING SO IT'S PROBABLY

04:58:06.468 --> 04:58:07.035
DOING PRETTY WELL RIGHT NOW-

04:58:07.102 --> 04:58:08.136
BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE- THERE'S

04:58:08.203 --> 04:58:09.771
SOME PEOPLE DOING VERY WELL OR

04:58:09.838 --> 04:58:11.240
VERY RICH. I THINK THE

04:58:11.306 --> 04:58:13.742
WEALTHIEST PEOPLE DOUBLE THEIR

REALIGNMENT ITSELF MEANS THAT

04:59:01.123 --> 04:59:01.690

REVIEWS FAR AS WE CAN PROJECT IS

04:59:22.010 --> 04:59:23.512
THAT GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT OR

04:59:23.578 --> 04:59:25.480
IS IT GOING TO BE BECAUSE OF

05:18:40.434 --> 05:18:42.670
QUESTION IS AROUND IS THAT IS IT

05:18:42.736 --> 05:18:45.806
MOSTLY JUST A WORK FORCE ISSUE

05:18:45.873 --> 05:18:48.976
AND AN UP- NOT ENOUGH CONTRACTED

05:18:49.043 --> 05:18:50.611
PEOPLE IN A NETWORK THAT THE

05:18:50.678 --> 05:18:53.614
REFERRAL SAID DON'T TAKE PLACE

05:18:53.681 --> 05:18:56.750
AS QUICKLY- I THINK THERE'S

05:18:56.817 --> 05:18:58.219
PROBABLY A NUMBER OF FACTORS I

05:18:58.285 --> 05:19:00.020
THINK THAT. WE HAVEN'T FORMALLY

05:19:00.087 --> 05:19:01.322
I MEASURED THIS ACROSS ALL THE

05:19:01.388 --> 05:19:02.323
RESPECTED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

05:19:02.389 --> 05:19:04.558

FUNDED WITH FEDERAL FUNDS AND

05:28:32.993 --> 05:28:40.634
OTHERS OTHER MAXIS. POINTS I

05:28:40.700 --> 05:28:42.369

ARE STILL ONGOING OR DO THEY

05:28:48.909 --> 05:28:50.277
START FADING AWAY AFTER WE KICK

05:28:50.343 --> 05:28:52.646

05:28:58.218 --> 05:28:59.252
HAPPENS WHAT HAPPENS IS THESE

05:28:59.319 --> 05:29:00.887
ACCESS POINTS. WE DO THIS NO

05:29:00.954 --> 05:29:02.722
PROBLEM YES THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE

05:29:02.789 --> 05:29:04.724
BIT DIFFERENT- BECAUSE THERE'S

05:29:04.791 --> 05:29:06.359
SO MANY DIFFERENT SETTINGS. AND

05:29:06.426 --> 05:29:08.328
THAT WE'VE BEEN EXPANDING. THEM

05:29:08.395 --> 05:29:10.363
AND SOME OF THEM. HAVE BEEN IN

05:29:10.430 --> 05:29:12.065
OUR LICENSING OUR LICENSING

05:29:12.132 --> 05:29:14.334
SYSTEM- SO PERHAPS THEY'VE BEEN

05:29:14.401 --> 05:29:16.736
PROVIDING. MEDICAL SERVICES BUT

05:29:16.803 --> 05:29:18.538
THEY HAVEN'T PROVIDED MEDICATION

05:29:18.605 --> 05:29:19.673
ASSISTED TREATMENT SO THE

05:29:19.739 --> 05:29:21.508
ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE. AS THE

05:29:21.575 --> 05:29:23.276
MEDIC HOW THEY JUST HAVEN'T. YOU

05:29:23.343 --> 05:29:23.977
KNOW DONE THAT AND THEY'RE

05:29:24.044 --> 05:29:26.847
SETTING TYPE OKAY- OTHERS ARE

05:29:26.913 --> 05:29:29.483
CONNECTED MAYBE TO. THE BROADER

05:29:29.549 --> 05:29:31.051
ETHICAL HEALTH MEDICAL SYSTEM

05:29:31.118 --> 05:29:32.819
WHICH ALSO PROVIDES A MEDICATION

05:29:32.886 --> 05:29:34.121
ASSISTED TREATMENT MAYBE IT'S AN

05:29:34.187 --> 05:29:36.223
INDIVIDUAL. PHYSICIAN THAT JUST

05:29:36.289 --> 05:29:37.791
NEVER CAUGHT THEIR ACT WAIVER

05:29:37.858 --> 05:29:39.226
AND NOW IT'S STARTING TO

05:29:39.292 --> 05:29:41.528
PRESCRIBE BUPRENORPHINE. AND WE

05:29:41.595 --> 05:29:43.029
ALSO HAD SOME SPECIAL PROJECTS%

05:29:43.096 --> 05:29:45.732
FOR OUR TRIBAL MEMBERS. AND SO

05:29:45.799 --> 05:29:47.134
ONCE AGAIN THEY HAVE FEDERAL

05:29:47.200 --> 05:29:48.468
DOLLARS AS WELL SO THEY'RE ALL A

05:29:48.535 --> 05:29:50.670
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. IN THE

05:29:50.737 --> 05:29:53.073
SENSE OF. WHAT THAT THE FUNDING

05:29:53.140 --> 05:29:55.108
SOURCE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT. USING

05:29:55.175 --> 05:29:56.877
THIS MONEY FOR SERVICES THAT'S

05:29:56.943 --> 05:29:58.311
REALLY MORE JUST TO HELP THEM

05:29:58.378 --> 05:30:00.614
SET UP. ON THE PROGRAM AND THEN

05:30:00.680 --> 05:30:02.249
THEY HAVE THAT THE FUNNY TO ME.

05:30:02.315 --> 05:30:03.917
OKAY SO THE- PROJECT THAT SO I

05:30:03.984 --> 05:30:05.519
THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW

05:30:05.585 --> 05:30:08.522
IS THAT. OF THE SIX HUNDRED

05:30:08.588 --> 05:30:09.689
FIFTY NOW PLUS ANOTHER HUNDRED

05:30:09.756 --> 05:30:11.625
WERE BUDGETING FOR. HOW MANY OF

05:30:11.691 --> 05:30:13.260
THEM AFTER WE SORT OF LAUNCH

05:30:13.326 --> 05:30:14.427
THEM OFF AND HE SAID WE COULD.

05:30:14.494 --> 05:30:15.762
STAY CONTINUE YOUR ROOM SO WE'RE

05:30:15.829 --> 05:30:16.930
TEACHING THEM HOW TO DO THIS NOW

05:30:16.997 --> 05:30:18.532
THERE BUT NOW THEY LEARN HOW TO

05:30:18.598 --> 05:30:19.666
DO IT THEY CAN GET MEDICAL

05:30:19.733 --> 05:30:21.134
REIMBURSEMENTS WHATEVER ELSE.

05:30:21.201 --> 05:30:22.335
HOW MANY OF THEM CONTINUE TO DO

05:30:22.402 --> 05:30:23.670
IT AS NOW THAT WE TRAIN THEM

05:30:23.737 --> 05:30:24.771
THEY SAY HEY I WANT TO DO THIS

05:30:24.838 --> 05:30:26.806
YOU TRAIN THEM. I'M NOW AN

05:30:26.873 --> 05:30:28.308
ACCESS POINT. AND THEN. THEY

05:30:28.375 --> 05:30:29.609
STILL CONTINUE TO BE AN ACCESS

05:30:29.676 --> 05:30:30.577
POINT I MEAN THERE'S LOTS OF

05:30:30.644 --> 05:30:31.945
DIFFERENT REASONS SOMEONE MAY

05:30:32.012 --> 05:30:33.480
STOP FOR EIGHT NINE. FOR SOME

05:30:33.547 --> 05:30:34.581
REASON NO PATIENTS ARE COMING

05:30:34.648 --> 05:30:36.016
EVERY FEW PATIENTS ARE COMING

05:30:36.082 --> 05:30:37.918
ARE DEFINED AT THE- YOU HAVE TO

05:30:37.984 --> 05:30:39.653
BE TRAINED AT IT'S- JUST BECOME

05:30:39.719 --> 05:30:41.087
VERY ONEROUS OR THEY'RE JUST TOO

05:30:41.154 --> 05:30:42.088
BUSY DOING EVERYTHING ELSE AND

05:30:42.155 --> 05:30:49.996
SO FORTH I. THINK IT'S JUST

05:30:50.063 --> 05:30:50.997
HELPFUL TO KNOW- HOW ME THEM

05:30:51.064 --> 05:30:52.365
STILL IN THE- RIGHT ARE STILL

05:30:52.432 --> 05:30:54.034
ACT. DOING IT RIGHT SO WE- WHAT

05:30:54.100 --> 05:30:55.235
WE- I'M STILL CERTAINLY IT'S THE

05:30:55.302 --> 05:30:57.837
END. OF THE C. HUNDRED. PLUS NOW

05:30:57.904 --> 05:30:59.306
- DO WE STILL HAVE SIX HUNDRED

05:30:59.372 --> 05:31:00.607
UP TO DO WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED

UP DO YOU STILL HAVE ALL THE-

05:31:02.676 --> 05:31:04.077
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY UP. I THINK

05:31:04.144 --> 05:31:05.812
I'D BE HELPFUL TO KNOW BECAUSE

05:31:05.879 --> 05:31:08.982
ALSO. IDENTIFYING WHAT THE

05:31:09.049 --> 05:31:10.584
REASON PEOPLE DROP OFF IS GOING

05:31:10.650 --> 05:31:13.053
TO BE IMPORTANT RIGHT- AND THEN

05:31:13.119 --> 05:31:15.188
IF WE KNOW WHY AND IF IT TURNS

05:31:15.255 --> 05:31:16.690
AND IT'S WE KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE

05:31:16.756 --> 05:31:18.458

EAGER TURNS OUT TO NOT REALLY

05:31:31.671 --> 05:31:32.906
THEY ENDED UP DROPPING OUT

05:31:32.973 --> 05:31:34.174
BECAUSE- YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUST

05:31:34.241 --> 05:31:35.909

05:53:12.437 --> 05:53:14.706
TOGETHER THE PROPOSAL DID IT

05:53:14.773 --> 05:53:17.309
INTENTIONALLY REALLY FOCUSING ON

05:53:17.376 --> 05:53:18.777
. REALLY SOME OF THE LESSONS

05:53:18.844 --> 05:53:19.878
LEARNED THAT WE'VE HAD DURING

05:53:19.945 --> 05:53:21.246
THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY

05:53:21.313 --> 05:53:23.248
SPECIFICALLY- WHICH REALLY

05:53:23.315 --> 05:53:24.950
ALLOWED US TO ZERO IN ON THE

05:53:25.017 --> 05:53:26.752
LIST THAT WE RECOMMENDED WE ALSO

05:53:26.818 --> 05:53:28.086
WE'RE LOOKINGAT THE OVER

05:53:28.153 --> 05:53:30.556
SECTION- AND CROSS OVER WITH OUR

05:53:30.622 --> 05:53:31.857
CONFERENCE OF QUALITY STRATEGY

05:53:31.924 --> 05:53:33.859
WHICH WE JUST RELEASED. A

05:53:33.926 --> 05:53:36.795
RECENTLY- IT WANTED TO ENSURE

05:53:36.862 --> 05:53:38.697
THAT ODD YOU KNOW THAT IS HOW WE

05:53:38.764 --> 05:53:40.766
NARROWED OUR LIST I WOULD JUST

05:53:40.832 --> 05:53:41.800
NOTE THERE ARE THERE ARE A

05:53:41.867 --> 05:53:43.135
SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THINGS

05:53:43.201 --> 05:53:44.836
STILL LEFT ON THE EIGHTY NINETY

05:53:44.903 --> 05:53:47.306
SEVEN REDUCTION LIST- AND SO I

05:53:47.372 --> 05:53:49.508
WOULD JUST NOTATE THAT- SO WE

05:53:49.575 --> 05:53:50.909
DID TRY TO DO AN INTERSECTION

05:53:50.976 --> 05:53:52.044
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THINGS LIKE

05:53:52.110 --> 05:53:53.645
NURSING SERVICES WHICH HAS BEEN

05:53:53.712 --> 05:53:55.180
YOU KNOW GREATLY IMPACTED DURING

05:53:55.247 --> 05:53:56.748
THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY INCH

05:53:56.815 --> 05:53:58.417
IT WAS A CRITICAL WORKFORCE.

05:53:58.483 --> 05:53:59.518
PRIOR TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH

05:53:59.585 --> 05:54:01.386
EMERGENCY AND JUST NOTATING IT

05:54:01.453 --> 05:54:02.888
SO CRITICAL ESPECIALLY EVEN IN

05:54:02.955 --> 05:54:04.489
RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE OF

05:54:04.556 --> 05:54:06.858
CALIFORNIA- OBVIOUSLY THE OXYGEN

05:54:06.925 --> 05:54:08.293
RESPIRATORY SERVICES ARE ARE

05:54:08.360 --> 05:54:10.829
CLEAR- IN ALIGNMENT WITH SOME OF

05:54:10.896 --> 05:54:12.698
OUR CONVERSATIONS EARLIER TODAY

05:54:12.764 --> 05:54:15.100
AUDIOLOGISTS. AND HEARING AID-

05:54:15.167 --> 05:54:16.868
ITEMS ADDED TO OUR LIST TO MAKE

05:54:16.935 --> 05:54:18.270
SURE WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO

05:54:18.337 --> 05:54:20.606
HELP IMPROVE THE AREAS OF

05:54:20.672 --> 05:54:22.941
REIMBURSEMENT- THERE- AND SO YOU

05:54:23.008 --> 05:54:24.543
KNOW WE REALLY TRY TO LOOK AT IT

05:54:24.610 --> 05:54:26.144
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE IN REGARDS

05:54:26.211 --> 05:54:27.479
TO UNDERFUNDING YOU DO NOT FEEL

05:54:27.546 --> 05:54:29.715
THAT WAY BUT WE DO KNOW THAT

05:54:29.781 --> 05:54:30.849
THERE WILL BE A DIRECT IMPACT ON

05:54:30.916 --> 05:54:32.551
THE FOR SERVICE WE HAVE DONE AN

05:54:32.618 --> 05:54:33.752
ASSESSMENT ON THE MANAGED CARE

05:54:33.819 --> 05:54:35.320
RATES- AND OFTENTIMES MANAGED

05:54:35.387 --> 05:54:36.555
CARE PLANS ARE PAYING HIGHER

05:54:36.622 --> 05:54:37.889
THAN OUR FEE FOR SERVICE RATES

05:54:37.956 --> 05:54:39.424
CURRENTLY EACH. OF WHICH IS WHY

05:54:39.491 --> 05:54:41.460
WE DID NOT SCORE IT- AND SO AT

05:54:41.526 --> 05:54:42.628
THIS POINT WE FEEL VERY

05:54:42.694 --> 05:54:46.565
COMFORTABLE WITH OUR OUR OUR

05:54:46.632 --> 05:54:47.833
BUDGET PROPOSAL- AND I WOULD

05:54:47.899 --> 05:54:49.868
NOTE. IS NOW ON HERE THAT I.

05:54:49.935 --> 05:54:52.104
VISITED HIM. PROSTHETIC CLINIC

05:54:52.170 --> 05:54:53.639
AND THEY HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT.

05:54:53.705 --> 05:54:55.807
NOT HAVING THEIR RATES. IMPROVED

05:54:55.874 --> 05:54:57.042
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME AND AS WE

05:54:57.109 --> 05:54:59.444
KNOW. OUR ISSUES WITH- DIABETES

05:54:59.511 --> 05:55:01.446
AND LOSS OF LIMBS THAT WAY. I

05:55:01.513 --> 05:55:02.714
JUST THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

05:55:02.781 --> 05:55:03.649
REALLY IMPACTS PEOPLE'S QUALITY

05:55:03.715 --> 05:55:05.684
OF LIFE. HIS ABILITY TO GET IT A

05:55:05.751 --> 05:55:10.255
GOOD FITTING. ARTIFICIAL LAMB-

05:55:10.322 --> 05:55:12.290
ON THE ISSUE ON THIRTY EIGHT. SO

05:55:12.357 --> 05:55:13.692
WITH THIS NEW TRANSFORMATION

05:55:13.759 --> 05:55:16.294
WHAT WITH THE PILOT. WILL BE

05:55:16.361 --> 05:55:19.931
ABLE TO SEE- PATIENTS ABLE TO

05:55:19.998 --> 05:55:22.601
SEE MORE THAN ONE- PROVIDER ON

05:55:22.668 --> 05:55:24.469
THE SAME DAY I'M ASKING ABOUT

05:55:24.536 --> 05:55:25.437
THE SAME DAY BILLING ISSUE

05:55:25.504 --> 05:55:28.173
REALLY. SHORT SO- THE PILOT

05:55:28.240 --> 05:55:30.542
HASN'T GONE LIVE YET BUT- THE

05:55:30.609 --> 05:55:32.010
EIGHT PM MODEL WOULD ALLOW AN

05:55:32.077 --> 05:55:34.646
FQHC TWO SEATS ON THE

05:55:34.713 --> 05:55:36.615
BENEFICIARIES AS MANY TIMES AS

05:55:36.682 --> 05:55:38.617
NEEDED IN THE DAY. GIVEN THE

05:55:38.684 --> 05:55:41.019
PAYMENT IS MORE LIKE A PM PM SO

05:55:41.086 --> 05:55:42.054
LIKE I ALMOST THINK ABOUT ALMOST

05:55:42.120 --> 05:55:43.955
LIKE HOW YOU PAY A PLAN A

05:55:44.022 --> 05:55:44.589
CAPITATION PAYMENT IS A LITTLE

05:55:44.656 --> 05:55:46.658
BIT DIFFERENT COURSES- BUT AT

05:55:46.725 --> 05:55:47.559
TEN PM THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE

05:55:47.626 --> 05:55:50.462
MONTHLY- FOR THEIR SERVICES AND

05:55:50.529 --> 05:55:51.863
SO THAT GIVES THE FTC

05:55:51.930 --> 05:55:56.034
SIGNIFICANT. FLEXIBILITY AND IS

05:55:56.101 --> 05:55:58.804
THAT. HE WITH YOU. IS PMP. DOES

05:55:58.870 --> 05:56:01.540

ACUITY OF THE OF THE PATIENT. IT

05:56:05.043 --> 05:56:06.511

OF FINANCING TO GIVE YOU AN

05:56:10.816 --> 05:56:11.883
OVERVIEW OF HOW THAT PM PM WOULD

05:56:11.950 --> 05:56:14.119
WORK. FIRST WHAT WE WOULD DO IS

05:56:14.186 --> 05:56:16.488
WE WOULD BE DEVELOPING A PER

05:56:16.555 --> 05:56:18.490

THE PARTICULAR BENEFICIARY. AND

05:56:23.662 --> 05:56:26.998
LOOK AT ME EXPECTED UTILIZATION

05:56:27.065 --> 05:56:29.468
HISTORICAL UTILIZATION. THERE

05:56:29.534 --> 05:56:32.070

VARIOUS AGE CATEGORIES SO IT

05:56:38.810 --> 05:56:40.412

THAT SCENE I'M NOT EXPECTING. A

05:56:43.582 --> 05:56:45.383
