SO BAR AND WILL LEAD TO GIVE THE OPERA FOR MY OF LOCAL SHARE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO LAST TO HAPPENOPENING REMARKS ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIMILAR MEMBER CHIU FOR YOUR DIGITAL LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC IT WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO WHEN THESE TWO COMMITTEES SELECT COMMITTEE ON HATE CRIMES IN THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE CONVENE AN OVERSIGHT HEARING. TO ROUTE TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT ON RAIMES- BACK THEN DATA REPORTS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THAT HATE CRIMES WERE ON THE RISE IN CALIFORNIA. THE MOST CURRENT DATA FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN SHOWS A TWO POINT 5% DIP IN HATE CRIMES. FROM SIXTY SIX. INCIDENCES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ALL THIS ALTHOUGH THIS OVERALL TREND IS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THE NUMBER OF EVENTS IS STILL TOO HIGH. THE MOST. UNDERMINE OUR DIVERSE STATE IN IMPACT ALL OF US TODAY I AM VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING ANY ADDITIONAL UPDATES IN THE REPORTED THE CRIME DATA AND TRENDS IN HOW OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY IS WORKING TO PREVENT DENTAL BY AND BONTA ã CRIMES I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO A CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSION ON HOW THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP.

THIS IS THE ONLY PROBLEM I SEE WITH CRIMES. THERE SOME OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL EVENTS IN DRIVE FEAR. IN THE COMMITTEES A COLOR LGBT Q. THESE IT INCREASING INSTANCE OF HATE CRIMES HAVE EVEN TRANSCEND POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL BELIEFS. THE FEAR THAT HATE CRIMES IMPOSE ON PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES CAN BE LIKENED TO ACTS OF TERRORISM. AND YET IN CALIFORNIA HATE CRIMES NOT CONSIDERED OTHER CRIMES WHAT'S THAT AGAIN IN CALIFORNIA TODAY RIGHT NOW HATE CRIMES NOT CONSIDERED VIOLENT CRIMES. WHEN A PERSON IS ACTUALLY CONVICTED AND SENT TO PRISON FOR ACTS OF HATE CRIME THEY'RE NOT CONSIDER CRIMINAL. CALIFORNIA LAW. THIS MEANS THAT THESE PERSONS ARE ELIGIBLE TO HEATHER SINCE IS REDUCED TO THE VERY BARE MINIMUM BY BEING ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RELEASE. THINK ABOUT THAT. THE FEAR IN VIOLENCE OR EVEN FEAR OF VIOLENCE A PERPETRATOR OF A HATE CRIME OR MULTIPLE ACTS OF HATE CRIMES. BECAUSE THE PEOPLE. TRYING TO LIVE THEIR LIVES PEACEFULLY IS NOT CONSIDERED VIOLENT. THIS MUST CHANGE NOW THAT'S IS COMMITTED TO ADD ON TO THAT DISCUSSION GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM.

BUT BUT THERE'S A MUCH LARGER CONTEXT- AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD WHERE HATE CRIMES ARE ON THE RISE. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT TO. HATE SPEECH FREQUENTLY- LATER MANIFESTS ITSELF AS VIOLENCE AND DO A WE SEE EVIDENCE OF THAT- ON AN ALL TO REGULAR BASIS SAID- IN OUR IN OUR WORLD TODAY AND SO PANEL DISCUSSIONS LIKE THIS AND RECEIVING INFORMATION ANALYZING IT TRYING TO TAKE ACTION- BECOMES.

AND THEY MAY BE ENTITLED TO HAVE THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT- EXHIBITING AND THE TAKEN ACTION. AS A FOLDER OF CRIMES THAT THAT IS A DIFFERENT MATTER SO IN THE COUNTRY OF- OUR- DIFFERENT RACES- AND THE MIXED UP.

CHAIRMAN TO CHEER SALAS. ASSEMBLY PERSON WILL. IS THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF COMING HERE WITH SOME OF OUR LATEST- DATA AND SUGGESTIONS- AS A PROPONENT WHO APPEARED BEFORE THIS BODY THREE YEARS AGO- TO VIGOROUSLY SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT OF RESPONSE TO HATE CRIME IN CALIFORNIA- WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE'RE GOING TO PRESENT TO YOU SOME OF THE EMERGING TRENDS. SOME SUGGESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE WELL DOT ORDER. INDEED URGING OTHER STATE TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING. ARM TRIMS IN CALIFORNIA LOOSELY FOLLOW NATIONAL CHANGES WITH SOME IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES FIRST CALIFORNIA LIKE THE NATION HAS SEEN A CLEAR UPWARD TREND OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. A DECLINE LITTLE BIT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS AS WELL THOUGH AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK WOULDN'T GETS LOST IN THE HEADLINES. AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE SALT. THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT TOO EVEN THOUGH WE HAD A DIP ASSAULTS- WE WERE TO RECORD- WORKS JUNIOR DECADE HIGH- WE'VE ALSO SEEN WE SHUFFLING AS TO WHO'S WHO'S GETTING ATTACKED. BOTH NATIONALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA ON ANTI MUSLIM HE CRIME IN PARTICULAR ANTI MUSLIM ASSAULT ON HEAD AND SHOULDER TOP AROUND TWENTY SIXTEEN- BUT SINCE THEN ANTI MUSLIM HATE CRIMES. HAS DECLINED COUSIN TO CLIMB TO LEVELS BELOW WHERE IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO SO WE'RE IN THIS INTEREST CHANNEL THAT WAY NATIONALLY WE AN ARM AN EXPLOSION REGARD TO XENOPHOBIC BUT- TYPE YOU KNOW. PRIME SCENE. AT HEARING IN IN NOW TWENTY WAS THIRTY PER OF THE F. B. I.'S RECORD LOW TWENTY FOURTEEN AND RECORDS WERE KIND OF LIKE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE CALIFORNIA HIT A RECORD IN TWO THOUSAND ONE. ALL OF OVER TWO THOUSAND HATE CRIMES AND IN IN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS A SAYS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF THAT LEVEL. SOME INTERESTING .COM IS GOING ON THOUGH- NOT JUST WITH REGARD TO GROUPS BUT GEOGRAPHY IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT HATE CRIME YOU CAN'T LOOK AT IT LIKE- SOME BROAD NATIONAL THING. IN TOTO. THE WEATHER- IT'S INFLUENCED BY A LOT OF BY LOCAL AND REGIONAL A CONDITION TO CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST CITY LOS ANGELES. ONE OF THE REST OF THE NATION'S THREE LARGEST SIX. HIT HARD IN TWENTY NINETEEN NOT SEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY FOR LA. B. R. TWO THOUSAND TWO CHICAGO NEW YORK AND WE TWO THOUSAND ONE. BUT MANY SMALLER STE. ANTI EIGHT. WE BELIEVE THE IS DRIVEN INTO PART BY AUTHORIZED IN SEMITIC HATE CRIMES WHICH WERE THE TOP CATEGORY IN THE NATION'S THREE LARGEST CITIES LAST YEAR SO WE HADN'T SEEN CERTAINLY IN RECENT MEMORY AGAIN IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST TEN. YEARS ENDING TWENTY EIGHTEEN HATE CRIMES DECREASED SLIGHTLY- BY 3% BUT THAT'S STILL 40% ABOVE LOS YOU HAVE TWENTY FOURTEEN- AND AGAIN NATIONALLY HATE CRIMES DROPPED BY FOR MORE OVER THAT PERIOD BY EIGHT POINT 5% BUT AGAIN ASSAULT OR OR OR UP IN THE STATE AT A DECADE HIGH UP TO FIVE TWENTY FIVE AND THAT'S- WELL. MORE WE WERE IN THE NINE TWO SHE EVEN WHEN HE GET A FOR. THAT'S BECAUSE OF ALL THE PROP CRIMES DECLINING I THINK A LOT OF THAT HEAT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY. INFORMAL ASSOCIATIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING SPEWED ONLINE- WE'VE SEEN A BIT OF AN INCREASE THERE. NATIONALLY PERSON DIRECTED HATE CRIME WHICH INCLUDES THREATS AND ASSAULT I HIT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS WELL- SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO- SO UP. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS A NATIONALLY WE STILL OF THE TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT- INCREASE IN THESE PERSON DIRECTED CRIMES COMPARED TO A 20% INCREASE OVERALL- AND I HAVE MORE DATA BUT WE- FIVE BECAUSE LIMITED TIME WE WON'T GO INTO THAT BUT I DO THINK THAT. CHAIR SALAS UP BROUGHT UP OF A VERY IMPORTANT AN INTERESTING TREND. ARM WHILE AFRICAN AMERICANS BOTH NATIONALLY IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR ITS STILL THE NUMBER ONE GROUP ATTACKED. WE SEEM DECLINE IN THE PROPORTION I AM INDEED FROM NINETEEN NINETY SIX NATIONALLY. FORTY TWO PER CENT OF ALL HE CRIMES THAT YEAR WERE AGAINST AFRICAN. TWENTY TWO WE WERE DOWN TO. 27% TO A BIG DROP THAT WAY BUT WE SEE A BIT OF A DEMOCRATIZATION OF HATE SO FOR INSTANCE WITH REGARD TO JEWS TO DISABLE TRANS GENDER GAY PEOPLE WE'RE SEEING EVERYBODY- AGAIN AND LATINOS IMPORTS PLEASE WELL ATTACK THOSE THOSE FOLKS. UP INTERESTINGLY AS WELL THOUGH ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORTS SHOW THAT THEY WERE ABOUT I THINK SIXTEEN COUNTIES REPORTED ZERO EIGHT CRIME. AND AGAIN- NATIONALLY- WE HAVE ABOUT 88% THAT. EITHER SAY ZERO HATE CRIMES OCCURRED OR OR THE THEY JUST DIDN'T TURN IN THEIR FORMS MOREOVER I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING ELSE THAT THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON AS WELL AND THAT IS EXTREMIST HOMICIDES OR DATE ON EXTREMIST HOMICIDES A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE AG COUNTY WHEN THEY COUNTED. ZERO ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE ACTUALLY COUNTED THREE WHICH IS WAS ON THE HIGHER END OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST DECADE NOT BECAUSE THE AG DO ANYTHING WRONG THAT INFORMATION CAME OUT. AFTER ARREST AND DURING THE INVESTIGATION AND- JUST BEFORE. TRIAL BOB PUT. WE SAW A- OR DELAY FEW. IN EXTREMIST HOMICIDES NATIONALLY UNTIL. TWENTY NINETEEN AND THIS IS THE LATEST DATA WE COUNTED AT LEAST TWENTY SIX WHITE SUPREMACIST MOTIVATED HOMICIDES. IN TWENTY NINETEEN. DEBT THAT AMOUNT THAT TWENTY SIX IS MORE THAN ALL THE EXTRAS HOMICIDES COMBINED FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THIS YEAR SIMILARLY. NINE TWENTY EIGHTEEN ACCOUNTED FOR THEM A RECORD NOW THEY DIDN'T COUNT THE POLLS NIGHTCLUB SO THERE'S SOME FLAWS IN HOW THEY COUNT STUFF BUT THEY'RE COUNTING A RECORD TO WITH REGARD TO HATE HOMICIDES AND CAME VERY CLOSE TO MATCHING BUT- WHAT WE FOUND. OUT TWENTY NINETEEN WILL BE A RECORD- JOSH BECAUSE OF EL PASO AND INDEED WE ARE NOW SEEING. LISTEN TO THIS THE WORST MASSACRE LAST YEAR. WAS A HEAT RELATED MASSACRE. THAT'S SOMETHING. ARM PREVIOUSLY I IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE FBI COUNTY TWENTY SEVEN ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENTS AND I AM THE GREATEST NUMBER OF A TELEPHONE THAT WAS THE PARK LAND- SHOOTING ANOTHER THING I THINK WE HAVE TO CONSIDER JUST BASED ON ON DETAIL TRYING TO GO THROUGH THIS REAL QUICK IS IT MONSTER AROUND ACTUAL ELECTION. OVER THE LAST DECADE WITH THE WORST CASE NATIONALLY OFFER HE CRIME AND WE'RE COMING INTO A VERY CONFLICT WILL TIME POLITICALLY WITH BOTH IMPEACHMENT END OF A NATIONAL ELECTION COMING UP TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE. SIX MATCHING WAS THE WORST MONTH FOR HATE CRIME- GOING BACK TO JUNE TWO THOUSAND THREE. AND THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION WAS THE WORST DAY. GOING BACK- TO ABOUT THAT THAT THE SAME THAT SAME TIME- MOREOVER OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS THE SECOND WORST MONTH. OUR FOR HATE CRIME OR LAST DECADE ANY CALIFORNIA THE DAY AFTER ELECTION. WAS WAS THE WORST DAY OF THAT OF THAT YEAR INTERESTINGLY THOUGH WE'RE ALSO SEEING- A DECLINE. IN IN IN CONVICTIONS IN PROSECUTIONS OF WITH RESPECT TO- WHEN. WHEN WE HAVE D. A.'S ACTUALLY WORK ON SOME AND PROSECUTORS FOR INSTANCE OF VOICE OF AMERICA FOUND A 30% DECLINE IN FEDERAL HATE CRIME PROSECUTIONS. AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE WE'RE SEEING ON UNFORTUNATELY- A DIFFERENCE WITH REGARD TO CONVICTIONS. SHE GOOD NEWS BUREAU JUSTICE FOR THE FIRST TIME SAID THAT THE MAJORITY A BARE MAJORITY OF HATE CRIME VICTIMS UP ARE REPORTING SO WHAT CAN WE DO AND WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE EXCELLENT. THE PIECES OF. ADVICE GIVEN IN THE ORDER WELL THE REALLY TO TRAINING DATA COLLECTION COORDINATION POLICY AN OUTRAGE THE GOOD NEWS IS CALIFORNIA WAS AMONG THE FIRST DATE- UNDER A- OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL VAN TO CAMP BACK IN THE EIGHTIES. A TO PUT TOGETHER TASK FORCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE HAVE THE CHASSIS WE DON'T HAVE A NEW TARGET YES THE TUNE UP- AND- AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE FOUND FOR INSTANCE. WAS A FAILURE TO IDENTIFY HATE CRIMES MIS IDENTIFICATIONS UNDER REPORTING- AND MISS REPORTING UP AND RATHER THAN GETTING INTO ALTHOUGH SHE IS I THINK WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL PERSON. FOR THAT- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WE ARE CENTER. AGREES WITH THE SUGGESTIONS OF FOUND AND IN THEIR AUDIT AND ALSO- WE ABIDE BY WHAT THE STATUTORY. AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE. THE WORK. WE DO THINK THERE THERE IS THERE IS A SUMMER FOR OF ALL WITH REGARD TO COLLECTION IT REALLY ACROSS THE STATE AND THE TREND NOW ESPECIALLY WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW NOT A BRIS FEDERAL SYSTEM IS TO REALLY STEP IT UP WITH REGARD TO THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT IS TRACKED BUT ALSO THE ADVOCACY IN THE TIMING OF WHEN THIS INFORMATION COMES OUT AND THAT WAS PART OF WHAT YOU WANT TO SUGGEST I'M GONNA DIVERT A LITTLE BIT. THERE'S SUGGEST JUST TO A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND NYPD COMPSTAT IS NOW GOING TO HAVE A MONTHLY HATE CRIME A REVIEW FRIEND WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING NATIONALLY IN MANY CITIES OR STARTING TO DO THIS KIND OF THING I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK PORTS SO WHEN WE ARE ACTUALLY HAVING ACT CHANGES SINCE CAN LOOK AT. ALL RIGHT MONTH OR SO THE OPENING POST YOU ARE AT THE END OF THE YEAR- MORE OVER A TRAINING- POST HAS A GREAT MEANING A LOT OF TIME. WITH ME TO A OUT IN. COULD BE A BILL PROBLEM BUT YOU'RE OPPORTUNITIES WE RESPECT TO ONSITE AND THE INTO AND ONE OF I'D LIKE SEE. OR OLD GOSH WAS ABOUT THIRTY AGO OLD THE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING CENTER TOGETHER OF PICK TRAINING. ON NATIONAL AND WHAT WE HAVE IS A STRIKE TEAM WHICH CONSISTS OF MYSELF AND OTHER SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND PRACTITIONERS PRINCES LIKE DETECTIVES PEOPLE FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. WE HAVE A HEAT IN RAPID RESPONSE TEAM BUT WE GOTTA PUT GASOLINE IN IT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE SHOULD DO IS CONSIDER HAVING SOME KIND OF ROUTINE SIZED AND CONTINUING TYPES OF. ADVISORY GROUPS WERE COMMITTEES OUR SYSTEM OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT AND COMMUNITY PEOPLE. MIGHT OVERLAP- DID DID MEET FOLKS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE LEGISLATURE- AS WELL AS THE AG'S OFFICE A LEAVE IT TO OTHERS. AS TO HOW TO HOW TO HOW TO. DO THAT. ALL SURE HOW OLD I I'M LIKE TO A ASK UP WE SEND SEVEN SEVEN A GROUPS INCLUDING A SENT A LETTER TO THE GO OFFICE I'M IN IF THE LEGISLATURE COULD JUST ASSIST US IN USING YOUR INFLUENCE TO GET SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS- ON ON ON THE TABLE- THERE AS WELL- BUT BOTTOM LINE IS WE KNOW WHAT WORKS- OUT REACH COORDINATION WITH WITH STAKEHOLDERS. CONTINUED INCLUDES NICE TRAINING ALL I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BECAUSE THE THERE IS A LIMITED TIME AND ALSO I'M FLYING OUT OF BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE THE HONOR OUR CENTER OF GETTING THE **** FAMILY AWARD FROM THE CAL STATE SYSTEM- AND THE CHANCE OR SAID I GOT TO BE THERE THIS AFTERNOON SO I LISTEN TO MIKE MY BOSSES WILL THE BOTTOM LINE IS HE CRIMES OF APPLY TO HOLD A BIT. BUT THEY STILL. ARM UP. MOST OF THE INCREASE OF THE WE SEE. AND THEY'RE GETTING VICE MORE OVER WE'RE TERROR TYPE GROUPS LIKE THE- WHICH ACTUALLY TO. ME IN ONE OF THE RECRUITING VIDEOS AND OTHERS ON IN BROTHERHOOD HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN GETTING MORE VIOLENT WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE SEEING OTHER STATES DO. IS HAVE TASK FORCES SOME WHICH IS JUST DEVOTED TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM IN NEW YORK NEW JERSEY THEY'RE CONSIDERING NEW LEGISLATION. THAT WHEN FIVE OR MORE PEOPLE ARE TARGETED THAT THAT BECOMES AN ACT OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM THERE'S THEIR THEIR ISSUES WITH THAT DIFFERENT STATES ARE ALSO LOOKING AT STREAMLINING THEIR DATA COLLECTION METHODS. AND CALIFORNIA WHICH ONCE WAS REALLY AT THE LEAD FOR HAVING THE HIGHEST NUMBER PER CAPITA HATE CRIMES BECAUSE WE COLLECTED THE DATA WELL. HAS ACTUALLY SLIPPED BEHIND PLACES LIKE MICHIGAN AND NEW JERSEY. SO WE CAN'T REST ON OUR LAURELS- I THINK WE'RE GOING INTO A VERY TENUOUS TIME. WITH RESPECT TO HATE CRIME BUT ALSO POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN THIS ELECTION YEAR OUR RESEARCH SHOWED. THAT FROM THIRD QUARTER TWENTY SIXTEEN TO THIRD QUARTER TWENTY SEVENTEEN AROUND THIS KIND OF CASH PHONES ALEXIAN TIME. VIOLENCE WILL DO PATIENTS IN THIS DEL. TO LEFT THE- A FULL YEAR THINGS ARE GETTING MORE VIOLENT HE'S ALSO A DINNER. TERRORISM TRY. OVER LEASE OR DATE AND- SHE- IT ARM. LASTLY I THINK WE NEED TO EXPAND OUR HICK COVERED TO. IMMIGRANTS DAD AND THE HOME WE SHOULD SO ASSEMBLY PERSON GIBSON'S A REFORM TO ADD HOMELESS TO BONE WILL GET THEM BUT WE'RE LITERALLY SEEING THESE PEOPLE BEING MURDERED- AND AGAIN LASTLY SOME KIND OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS- WITH THE AG'S OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE LEGISLATURE WERE OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS GET TO MEET WITH. OUR OUR VAUNTED OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS SO THAT WE CAN ADVISE HIM ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS PERHAPS QUARTERLY OR BI ANNUALLY- ONCE AGAIN LET ME JUST.

GONZALEZ MEAN COMMENTS YOU ON THE- MAIL OKAY SO OR AUDITOR. ELAINE HOWELL PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CHAIR SALAS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOW ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR WITH ME AS ERIN FILNER MISTER FOUND THERE WAS THE- PROJECT SUPERVISOR ON THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE THIS PRESENTATION IS YOU DO HAVE A HANDOUT THAT MR FELDER WILL STEP YOU THROUGH WHAT I'M GOING TO DO PRIOR TO THAT IS JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A REFRESHER ON THE ISSUES THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT REPORT THEY AND WILL ALIGN. WITH THEM THE COMMENT AT TOP MR LEVINE YES PROVIDED SO AS YOU MAY RECALL WE ISSUE- THE AUDIT REPORT AND MAY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WE AS AFTER WE ISSUE A REPORT WE RECEIVED RESPONSES FROM THE ENTITIES THAT WE'VE AUDITED SIXTY A SIX MONTH AND ONE YEAR SO THE PRESENTATION AT MISTER FOUND THERE WILL BE PROVIDE OKAY WILL BE AS OF MAY THE RESPONSE WE READ KEY FOR EACH OF THE ENTITY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO. PRESENT WILL WILL BE TO TALK ABOUT THREE TO. CAT VERY SOME TO THE PRE. SPEAKER OUT REACH REPORTING AND TRAINING- AND THE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF OUTREACH. SO TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF SCOPE QUICKLY- WE WERE ASKED TO GO OUT TO A SAMPLE OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SO WE VISITED LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF STANISLAUS COUNTY SHERIFF AND SAN FRANCISCO STATE. POLICE DEPARTMENT WE ALSO SURVEYED LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN CALIFORNIA WE SURVEYED OVER TO OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY- LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES RECEIVE THERE ARE VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE ABOUT 70% SO WE HAVE RESPONSES FROM. A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SO THAT HELPS GIVE. A STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE IN ADDITION TO THE- THE WORK THAT WE DID OUT AT THE FOR ENTITIES THAT WE VISITED SO WITH RESPECT TO AN OUT REACH OUR CONCLUSION WAS THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. IS NOT DOING ENOUGH AS FAR AS CONDUCTING OUT REACH AND THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE COULD CERTAINLY ASSIST WITH SOME OF THAT. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE LOCALS TWO OF THE FOUR ENTITIES THAT WE VISITED WERE NOT CONDUCTING ANY OUT REACH AT ALL IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN THE SURVEY RESPONSE INDICATED THAT ABOUT 30% OF THE ENTITIES THAT WE SURVEYED THAT RESPONDED TO OUR SURVEY SAID. NOW WE WILL CONDUCT A REACH YOU CAN. USE. AND THE A CRITICAL PORTENT ON CERTAINLY BECAUSE- RESEARCH IS TO. THAT HE CRIMES ARE REAP. WHY IS THAT. FEAR OF FEAR OF DEPORTATION LACK OF TRUST IN THE COMMUNITY NOT REALLY A LACK OF TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND- VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE COMMUNITY. TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REPORT HATE CRIMES SO THAT THEY CAN BE ADDRESSED. AND HOPEFULLY- YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS ARE REDUCED. DOJ WE BELIEVE IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO ASSIST LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE THEY ARE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO COLLECT THE DATA. THEY COULD ANALYZE THAT DATA AND THEN PROVIDE SOME ANALYSES TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AS FAR AS- DO WE NEED TO DO TARGETED OUTREACH AND VERY. AT AREAS OF THE CITY UP WITH RESPECT TO VARIOUS GROUPS THAT ARE IN- THEY ARE VICTIMS OF THESE HATE CRIMES. IN ADDITION WE IDENTIFY THE ROUTE. THAT CREATED BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND WHEN WE DO DURING THE TO THE AUDIT THERE REALLY. A OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT PARTICULAR TEAM- COULD DO AND WOULD BE ABLE TO DO FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCAL COMMUNITIES DOJ CERTAINLY WAS AWARE OF THEIR RESPONSE TEAM BUT THEY WEREN'T. ADVERTISING IT THEY WEREN'T ENCOURAGING LOCALS TO REACH OUT FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SO WE THINK- INCREASING AND IMPROVING OUT REACH- WILL CERTAINLY HELP. THESE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES OUR SURVEY RESPONDENTS INDICATED I THINK WAS 83% OF OUR SURVEY RESPONDENTS SAID THEY HAD NEVER RECEIVED ANY TYPE OF GUIDANCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ABOUT HOW TO CONDUCT THE OUT REACH. HOW IMPORTANT OUT REACHES- THE BENEFIT THE BENEFITS OF OUT REACH IT CETERA SO WE HAD A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO ALL OF THE ENTITIES WITH RESPECT TO OUTREACH. NOW REPORTING. CERTAINLY ARE WE FOUND THAT HATE CRIMES WERE UNDER REPORTED WE DID SOME ANALYSES OF- INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE ENTITIES THAT WE SURVEYED WE ASK THEM TO REPORT THEIR- A HATE CRIME DATA AND WE COMPARED IT TO THE DATA THAT WAS REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND THERE WERE DIFFERENT. INFORMATION WE WERE FROM THE- WAS HIGHER NOT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BUT HIGHER SO THERE WAS A DISCONNECT THERE. WE ALSO CAN AUDITS OF CAMPUS CRIME. REPORTING THAT UNDER THE CLEAR ACT THAT'S A STATURE MEANT THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT EVERY THREE YEARS SO WE LOOKED AT THE CLEARY. INFORMATION AND WE AGAIN FOR. PERMISSION AND A CLEAR IT REPORTS. OF THAT UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO SUBMIT THAT WERE NOT SOME OF THOSE CRIME SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE HATE CRIME DATA THAT WAS REPORTED TO THE STATE TO DO JAKE. AND WE FOUND DIFFERENCES THERE SO THERE'S REALLY. AT THE TIME WE CONDUCTED THERE ARE THERE WERE REALLY SOME CONCERNS WITH RISK TO. FULL AND ACCURATE REPORT FROM THE LOCALS UP TO THE FRONT OF JUST. SO. WE FELT DOJ A- IS UNIQUE POSITIONED THEY NEED TO PROVIDE OVER. TO LAW FOR. FIRST QUESTION WHERE DOJ IS WHO ALL ARE THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES THAT YOU'RE RECEIVING DATA FROM. AND THEY AT THAT TIME DID NOT HAVE A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT SHOULD BE REPORTING THIS DATA. TO DOJ SO THAT WAS THAT WAS CONCERNED NUMBER ONE. CONCERN NUMBER TWO AGAIN WHAT DO JANE PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO THE LOCALS AS TO WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS WERE. WITH RESPECT TO WHAT THEY SHOULD REPORT WHEN THEY SHOULD REPORT IT- SO THE THIS SURVEY AGAIN INDICATED THAT MANY MANY OF. A HIGH PERCENT OVER 80% OF THE ENTITIES THAT WE SURVEYED SAID AGAIN WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY TYPE OF GUIDANCE FROM THE OKAY. ABOUT THE TYPES OF. READ THAT WE NEED TO SUBMIT THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO SUBMIT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND THE FINAL THING WITH RESPECT TO REPORTING IS DOJ WASN'T LOOKING AT THOSE REPORTS AND DOING AN ANALYSIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WAS BEING REPORTED WAS ACCURATE AND COMPLETE. SO THAT IF THEY DID AN ANALYSIS AGAIN TYING BACKED OUT REACH THEY WOULD HAVE THE CORRECT INFORMATION TO DO AN APPROPRIATE ANALYSIS- AND THEN THE LAST AREA IS TRAINING TRAINING IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND AS AS PROFESSOR LEVINE INDICATED THERE WERE AND MANY INSTANCES WHERE A CRIME WAS MISIDENTIFIED. IT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HATE INCIDENT AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS A HATE CRIME. SO THAT LEADS TO UNDER REPORTING- AND WE FOUND THAT CONSISTENTLY. AMONG THE LOCAL ENTITIES THAT WE VISITED WHERE THEY WERE MISCLASSIFIED CERTAIN CRIMES. SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS A CRIME. AND IN MANY CASES WAS CLASS AND AS A INCIDENT. FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY THERE. I HATE CRIMES ALSO NOT USING ALL OF THE TOOLS THAT ARE OUT THERE THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE SUPPLEMENTAL- HATE CRIME REPORT. THAT REALLY CAN ASSIST LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IDENTIFYING A HATE CRIME SO THAT IT CAN BE REPORTED. AND SOME OF THE ENTITIES WE VISITED MANY OF THE ENTITIES WE SURVEYED WERE NOT USING THIS SUPPLEMENTAL HATE CRIME REPORT. SO AGAIN MORE GUIDANCE MORE ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL SO THAT THEY DO CORRECTLY- FULLY AND ACCURATELY REPORT HATE CRIMES TO. DOJ SO DOJ CAN PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO LOCALS. THE FINAL AREA WITH RESPECT TO TRAINING IS AGAIN UP POST THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING WHAT WE FOUND IS IN THE POLICE ACADEMY THEY DO PROVIDE SOME TRAINING WITH RESPECT TO HATE CRIMES. BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS THERE IS NO REFRESHER TRAINING IT'S THE ONE TIME YOU'RE IN THE ACADEMY RECEIPT RECEIVE THAT TYPE OF TRAINING. VERY FEW OF THE ENTITIES THAT WE VISITED WERE PROVIDING ANY REFRESHER TRAINING- MOST OF THE ENTITIES THAT WE- SURVEYED SAID THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING REACHED REFRESHER TRAINING EITHER. WHAT WE DID FIND THIS POST HAD SOME GOOD TRAINING- THEY HAD TRAINING AVAILABLE THAT WAS FREE THEY HAD MATERIALS THAT WERE FREE THAT COULD BE PROVIDED TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ALLOW LOW LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO. I HAVE THEIR OFFICERS RECEIVE REFRESHER TRAINING- SO WE FELT THAT WE NEEDED TO HAPPEN WE MADE SOME RECOMMENDED TO RAISE. TO THE OTHER ISSUE TO POSTED WHETHER OR NOT WERE A FOR. ANALYZE HOW WELL AS HOW IS THIS TRAINING KING THE TRAY THAT IS PROVIDE IT IT IS IT. WORKING FOR. IT GIVES THEM AN INFORMATION. THANK DO OUR BEST JOB. WHEN THEY OUT RESPONDING TO AN SAID. AND DETERMINING IT'S A CRIME NEEDS TO BE. OR WHETHER IT'S SHOULD BE CLASS AS A HATE INCIDENT SO WE HAD RECOMMENDATIONS TO POST AS WELL. SO THAT'S A VERY QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE THREE AREAS- THAT WERE LAID OUT IN THE AUDIT REPORT WHAT MR OUND THERE IS GOING TO DO IS HE'S GOING TO STEP YOU THROUGH THIS SUMMARY DOCUMENT WHICH WILL TAKE YOU THROUGH. ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE TO THE TO THE ENTITIES AND WHAT THE CURRENT STATUS IS OF. EACH ENTITIES IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU BUT THE FIRST PAGE WE HAVE A SUMMARY ON THE STATUS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THERE'S TWENTY ONE IN TOTAL AND THEN ON PAGE TWO ALTHOUGH HAD WALK YOU THROUGH THE STATUS THIS REX INDIVIDUALLY. THIS PAGE DETAILS THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO DOJ CONCERNING OUTREACH EFFORTS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SPECIFICALLY WANTED DOJ TO CREATE AND DISSEMINATE OUTREACH MATERIALS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE TO USE WHEN THEY GO OUT SPECIFICALLY TO- FOCUS ON AVERAGE TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THOSE FROM AND- EXPERIENCE A HATE CRIME AND THOSE- LEAST LEAST LIKELY TO REPORTED WE DID FIND. THAT THE KIND OF AT THE ONE YEAR MARK THEY DOJ HAS UPDATED ITS HATE CRIME PAMPHLET AND THIS WEBSITE. AND ALSO HOSTED A HATE CRIME OF EVENTS BOB HOWEVER IT IS YET TO DISTRIBUTE OR CREATE ANY NEW MATERIALS RELATED TO OUTREACH EFFORTS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES COULD USE. SO ALTHOUGH IT IS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED THEY HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO THERE FOR THIS FIRST TWO RECOMMENDATIONS. THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION THE PAGE DETAILS THE HE CRIME RAPID RESPONSE TEAM. NOW WITH. IDEAS EXPERTS DOJ THAT GO TO THIS LONG FORCED WHENEVER THEY- A ARRAY OF A CAR ARE ONE X. EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH PRO. CASE HOWEVER ONLY HALF OF LONG FOR SO AGENCIES. WE SURVEYED EVEN KNEW OF ITS EXISTENCE ADDED NEVER EVEN BEEN DEPLOYED. SO WE RECOMMENDED THAT AND DOJ HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED- KIND OF SENDING OUT INFORMATIONAL NOTICES UPDATING ITS WEBSITE AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE ENTITIES AND STATE NEW- THAT THEY COULD RELY ON DOJ IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN. SAID SIT OUT REACH ON THAT PAGE THREE. WE DISCUSS RECOMMENDATIONS TO DOJ RELATED TO IMPROVING HATE CRIME REPORTING. NOW THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION THERE IS TO DEVELOP A LIST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE ALL THE REPORTS THEY NEED SO WHEN WE FIRST WENT OUT TO DOJ NOT ONLY DID THEY HAVE AN INCOMPLETE LIST OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES THAT WERE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE MONTHLY BUT 40% OF THE INFORMATION FOR CONTACTING THOSE IN AGENCIES WAS INCORRECT OR INCOMPLETE. SO EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO SEND A NOTE. WE COULDN'T IN ADDITION WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT THEY SEND OF GUIDANCE ON HOW TO REPORT ACCURATELY TO THE AGENT. TO THE TO ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES. AND THEN CONDUCT PERIODIC REVIEWS SO ONCE THE NEW OKAY WE'RE GETTING THE REPORTS FROM EVERYONE EACH EACH MONTH. ARE THEY DOING A DISTRIBUTOR WHICH FOR THAT THAT'S ACCURATE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT ABOUT 20% OF THE HE CRIME REPORTS. SENT TO DOJ WERE AN ACTOR IN SOME RESPECT. SO DOJ HAS DEVELOPED SOME NEW PROCEDURES- TO LOCATE AND ADD NEW LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO ITS LIST. OF REQUIRED REPORTERS. AND IT HAS DRAFTED SOME DOCUMENTATION AND AIDS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES TO USE TO ENSURE THAT THE REPORTING ACCURATELY. HOWEVER IT HASN'T FINALIZED ANY OF THAT GUIDANCE- OR POSTED. OR DISSEMINATED. IT ALSO HAS DEVELOPED ANY SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT THE REPORT THAT IT IS RECEIVING ARE- ARE ACCURATE. SO THERE'S- KIND OF SOME MOVEMENT SOME PROGRESS BUT AGAIN IT'S KIND OF. YET TO FULLY IMPLEMENT MANY OF THE RECOMMENDED ANY THE ELEMENTS THAT RECOMMENDATION. IN A TWO RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS PAGE ARE AIMED AT INCREASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF REPORTING THE DOJ. SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE ADDING IS ZIP CODE WHEN WE FOUND THAT A LOT OF THESE JURISDICTIONS THAT THESE- LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ITS RESPONSE BEFORE VERY LARGE SB NO ALLEY PD- BAKERSFIELD ASH- KERN COUNTY SHERIFF THINGS LIKE THAT. AND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT EVEN IF DOJ WERE TO ANALYZE WHERE HE COMES A RECURRING TO ACTUALLY GET ANYTHING SUBSTANTIVE TO- TO THE LOCALS. ESPECIALLY THE CASE WHERE SAY THERE WAS A RASH OF SIMILARLY TYPE TAKE CRIMES OCCURRING IN A REGION THAT WAS YOU KNOW. GOING TO MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. SO WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE- AND DOJ IS PENDING IMPLEMENTATION ON THEIR CYBER SYSTEMS OF CYBER IS THE- HAVE THE IT'S GOING TO GET DOJ WORKING WITH DIVERSE THE NATIONAL SYSTEM. CYBER SHOULD HAVE THE FUNCTIONALITY TO INCLUDE AS ZIP CODE AND ADDRESS INFORMATION FOR EACH HATE CRIME REPORT. AND THEN CYBER SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE FUNCTIONALITY TO ALLOW DOJ TO SEARCH FOR PARTICULAR HATE CRIMES AND THEN SEND OUT ALERTS TO LOCALS WHEN THEY FIND OUT THAT- THAT THERE MIGHT BE CRIMES OCCURRING ACOSTA SPECIFIC REGION THAT IMPLEMENTATION CYBER IS TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PENDING THAT IMPLEMENTATION NEXT YEAR. ON PAGE FOUR- WE'VE RECOMMENDATION TO DOJ AND POST CONCERNING HATE CRIME TRAINING. SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMENDED THAT DOJ PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND PRODUCE TRAINING MATERIALS FOR THEM- NOW DOJ HAS WORKED WITH POST TO UPDATE ITS MODEL HE CRIME POLICY POSTS MULLIN PRINT POLICIES KIND OF THE TEMPLATE OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIESCOULD USE WHEN BUILDING THEIR OWN OF CREATING THEIR OWN POLICY- HOWEVER DOJ HASN'T. DEVELOPED OR DISSEMINATED ANY TRAINING MATERIALS OF ITS OWN SO ALTHOUGH IT'S ON SOME WORK IT'S STILL ONLY PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED THE- TO RECORD IS THE BOTTOM OF THAT PAGE ON FOR ARE DIRECTED TO POST. AND TO PUSH CREDIT IT HAS FULLY IN BOTH RECOMMEND. AND THOSE ARE TWO TO SAN TAKE CRY TRAINING AS LONG FOR ENTITY. AND ALSO EVALUATE THAT PERIODICALLY POSTS. AS SUBS OVER ISSUED. SENATOR CD TO ALSO HUNDRED PLUS LAW FORCED AGENCIES THAT THAT IT. IT ALSO. HOSTED THE HATE CRIME TRAINING ITS WEB. FOR ANYONE TO TAKE IN. ANYONE WHO TAKES THE TRAINING OR AS AN INSTRUCTOR FOR THE TRAINING CAN GIVE FEEDBACK TO POST VIçT PORTAL. SO IT'S IMPLEMENT A BOTH OF THOSE. FINALLY A FIVE PAGE FIVE OF THESE INCLUDES REGULAR TO THE FORD ENFORCEMENT AGE WITH. FOR REVIEW NOW WE SHOULD THIS TO WRITTEN THAT. AND FRANCIS STATE POLICE TO. NAMELY THAT THEY TO BOTH UPDATE HATE CRIMES. AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN OVERSIGHT ON REPORTING BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT THEY WERE NOT IDENTIFYING HATE CRIMES APPROPRIATELY AND THEY WERE UNDER REPORTING HATE CRIMES THAT THEY EVEN DID IDENTIFY CORRECTLY. SO IN RESPONSE- SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED BOTH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THE HATE CRIME POLICY UPDATED HAS BROUGHT IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW. AND IS NOW ACTIVELY- LOOKS AT THE REPORT SUBMITTED EACH MONTH TO DOJ TO INSURE THEIR ACCURATE SO DEVOID OF BOTH RECOMMENDATIONS THERE LAPD HAS DRAFTED A NEW HATE CRIME POLICY APPARENTLY IT'S A LARGE EXPANSION ON THE OLD ONE. AND THEY'VE INDICATED TO US THAT IT WILL IMPLEMENT BOTH RECOMMENDATIONS WHEN IT IS FINALIZED. AND I BELIEVE YOU TALKED WITH A- LET'S TAKE TO FOR FROM LAPD CAN YOU AN UPDATE. THE FINAL TO RECOMMEND ON THE PAGE CAN OR COUNTY STANNIS. COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS. NOW THESE TWO COUNTIES DIDN'T HAVE SUPPLEMENTAL HE CRIME REPORTS POST RECOMMENDED THAT HAVING A SOPHOMORE HE CRIME REPORT WAS CRITICAL BECAUSE ONE OFFICERS WARRANT DON'T GET A LOT OF EXPERIENCING HATE CRIMES DON'T KNOW WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK. AND PROSECUTORS REALLY NEED THAT ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO GET CONVICTIONS. AND ORANGE COUNTY TO ITS CREDIT DID AND- CREATE AND REQUIRE OFFICERS TO USE A SUPPLE HE CRIME REPORT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS THE REPORTS REPORTS ISSUANCE. STANISLAUS COUNTY INDICATED THAT ITS CURRENT REPORTS WERE ADEQUATE AND IT WOULD NOT CREATE A NEW ONE AND HAS NOT RESPONDED TO ANY SUBSCRIBER RESPONDENTS FROM US AFTER THE SIXTY DAY ISSUANCE. SO THEY HAVE A THERE'S BEEN NO MOVEMENT NO ACTION TAKEN ON THAT RECOMMENDATION. FINALLY ON PAGE SIX- THERE'S LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ALL MERE THOSE DIRECTED TO DOJ AND POST. THAT OF WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED BUT THERE HAS BEEN LEGISLATION INTRODUCED THAT WOULD HAVE IMPLEMENTED THESE WRECKS. AND OUR HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LOG IN EVERY YOUR MEETING YOUR ALL THAT READ REPORT ONE ONE JOB AS YOU COULD GO TO YOUR STAFF AS WE- AS WOULD WE WOULD ALSO JOINED BY SEN. WAR AND ALSO ARE OF APPROVED CHAIR OF MEMBER GONZALEZ WHERE DO WAS A AB THROUGH OLD AND IF WE HAVE TWO FOUR WITH BUT ANYWAY. EIGHT NOTED THE OPPORTUNITY HERE AND SAUL WOULD BE A REALLY OF UP FOR AND THE IS YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. A ANYBODY. FOR A DOCTOR CHOI. THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUT I WANNA AS I IT IS MY- I AM BEGINNING TO. WONDER HOW YOU DO. THE CRIME BECAUSE OR OR LEAVE A I THOUGHT THAT SOME MEMBER HE CRIME MEANS SOME MORE OF THE IN A GENDER. A RE THE RE TO OR REYES SO READ. TELL WHAT I. RIDLEY THE- JEWISH BE WERE. COMPLAIN AND AS YOU T. PAY WILL COME. AND MINORITY PEOPLE COMPLAIN AND OF THE- AREAS A BUTTON. COME TO. THINK ABOUT IT THAT L. OR THE CRIME ME YOU CAN. IF I HATE CRIME. IN YOU ALSO MENTION THAT THE ONE OF THE TO DID NOT A DEAF IN OF A CRIME IS SO HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE. IN US ON SOME MENTIONED EVEN PUBLIC CRIME TO IT IT IT HAD TO THIS RIGHT NOW IS TO DO A BRICK TO. IN A DEMOCRATS TO AND WAS GOING ON RIGHT NOW SO IN IT BECOMES SO BLOATED WITH THIS AND THIS IN THE DAY AND AGE YOU WHAT DO YOU DEFINE NASSAU HATE CRIME ANYTHING THAT THE YOU DO. THE IF I SOMETHING SOMETHING STUNT TO THE NEIGHBOR- IS IT BECAUSE OF A FEMALE LIVING IN THERE MAY THE INDIA SINGLE LIVING IN THEIR OLD WHAT THE IN A HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE IT DAY BECOMES BLOW TO ME. I THINK THERE SO THERE'S SUPPORT HATE CRIME IN A HATE WHERE HE CRIME IS A CRIME ACT. IT WHOLE OR IN BECAUSE OF A PERCEIVED CHARACTER ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CHARACTERISTICS BASED ON DISABILITY GENDER NATIONALITY RACE ETHNICITY RELIGION. SEXUAL ORIENTATION. WHERE AS A HEAT INCIDENT. SO THAT THAT'S WHERE THERE'S A HEAT INCIDENT IS WHERE THERE THERE'S CRIME CT TO SEE SEATED THE ACT TO PAY SO COULD BE HATE SPEECH. BUT THERE IS NO WAS VAN. SO WITH THAT. SO IT'S VERY CLEAR THE LOWER KINDA HATE CRIME AND THAT. WHAT OTHER. LOS AGENCY MIGHT TRY WHICH ARE HE INSTANCE. YEAH BUT JUST INTERJECT ARM. IN CALIFORNIA IT IT HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOTIVE. IN FOR TODAY THE A LEADS I HOPE I DIDN'T JUMP THE GUN IS THE BEING AND WHY OTHER WOULD AND THEY- OB TO CLOSE A FELT LOOPHOLE WHICH WE- WANT THE CIRCUIT SAID THAT. MUST BE A FOUR UP TO PUT IT IF I COULD JUST. SO SOMETHING THAT WITH THE TO A THE- UP ONE THINGS THAT WE DID IN COOPERATE BUZZ AS WE LOOK AT CITY IN THE UNITED. AND LOOK AT AGGRAVATED ASSAULT REPORT AND WE ACTUALLY FOUND A BUNCH. WE'RE NOT CLASSIFY HE CRY YOU LOW VERBIAGE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION WAS CLEARLY THERE AND WE WERE SEEING LARGE CITIES LIKE NEWARK REPORTING LIKE ZERO OR IT WAS WE SHOULD BE IT'S SIXTEEN COUNTY. HERE ONE THING THAT BE HELPFUL AND THIS IS WHY I I'D LIKE TO DEFER TO THE AUDITOR'S. ON THEIR REGULATORY AND STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS BUT BOTTOM LINE THE FBI SUGGEST THE TWO HEAR. A REVIEW WHERE IT'S NOT JUST WHAT IS YOUR BY WAY FOR YOU SO FOR YOUR YOUR LEDGER. WITH RESPECT TO SEE FORMS IN PA. ALL THE TO REVIEW WOULD NOT AT THE TOP. OF THE CALL. BUT AFTERWARDS DO SOME LIKE FOR WHATEVER STANFORD POLICY REVIEW HE- LIAISON OFFICER COULD BE THE- TO OR SOME OF LIKE THAT THE ACTUAL. FOLLOWS UP AND LOOK AT THE KEY OF THE COME IN MOST DO HAVE THAT MANY KEY THE COMING AND PROTECT. CASES IN SCHOOL VANDALISM AB ASSAULT OR WE SEE A G. PATTERN IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO SOME WAY MEMORIALIZED SECOND HERE REVIEW. IN THE STATE HERE UP NOW WHETHER THAT'S DONE BY POLICY OR LEGISLATION I'LL LEAVE THAT TO OTHERS AT A HIGHER P. GREED THE ME TO DECIDE. AND ON. GREAT ASSEMBLY. IS FILLED. YES AND I SURE ACTUALLY I WAS IN **** BECAUSE- HE KNOW YOU CALL IT THE DEVICE. OF HATE. ACROSS ALL THE GROUPS AND SIX COUNTIES ARE. BUT I WAS WONDERING HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS BECAUSE OF DEFINITION- BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE GUIDELINES OF PROCEDURES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT- BECAUSE AND WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE- TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION WHETHER THAT'S DONE LEGISLATIVELY OR WHETHER THAT'S DONE- THROUGH ANOTHER MEANS AND I'M JUST. TRYING TO SEE THE COMET JUST ON THAT BECAUSE OF TRYING TO FIND SOME. ACTIONABLE ITEMS WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH SO THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DOES HAVE A DOES INITIATED DESK REVIEW PROCESS AND ALL OF THE HATE CRIMES TO COME IN AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY PER CAPITA RATE OF HATE CRIMES IS ALMOST DOUBLE. WHAT CALIFORNIA'S IS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT MIGHT THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THAT MAYBE BECAUSE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ASKING FOR ALL OF THE REPORTS FROM THE LOCALS. AND CHECKING THEIR WORK AND CHECKING TO SEE ARE YOU REPORTING ALL OF THEM SO THAT'S WHY WE MADE THAT RECOMMENDATION TO IDEA DATA ALSO. A CALIFORNIA DOD TO DO THAT AND THE LATEST DATA NEW JERSEY ONLY ABOUT NINE MILLION PEOPLE REPORTED ABOUT NINE HUNDRED FIFTY HE CROSSED. IN NINETEEN. OUT OF COURSE THE MUCH MORE DOWN POPULATED. STATE AND- THAT ARE LEFT DENSELY. HOW THE OF A LOWER A- BUT WE'RE ROUTINE SEEN. OUR MANY JURISDICTION. NOT ONLY UP LOW POPULATION COUNTIES THE WAY. OF TO REPORT BUT LARGE CITIES FROM SOME LIKE ADD. WHICH IS IN THE TO TOP TEN. REPORTS LIKE ZERO TWO AND GIVEN YEAR. SIR WE SAYING THEN THE D. NUMBERS OF A- SHOWING ID OR PROP. NOT THE FULL PICTURE. BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST NOT BEING REPORTED CORRECTLY- THESE FORMS ON EXISTS TO ACTUALLY SHOW HATE INCIDENCES THAT COULD POSSIBLY CLASSIFIES HATE CRIMES I MEAN IN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT CORRECTLY. YES IT CERTAINLY WITHIN THE MARGIN OF THE MARGIN VERY GIVEN CHIP BUT IT IS ALSO NATIONALLY- THE- TWENTY SEVENTEEN LAS VEGAS. DIDN'T SEND IN THEIR ENVELOPE. THAT WOULD CHANGE THE NATIONAL PICTURE GIVE AN EXAMPLE SO YEAH IT'S IT BUT CERTAINLY WHAT I CAN TELL YOU FROM FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING. ARE WE HAVE HAD THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASES OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND IN PARTICULAR- THESE THESE VIOLENT THESE VIOLENT CRIMES AND HOMICIDES. WHEN HE SAID EXTREMISTS HOMICIDES EARLIER WHAT KIND OF INCIDENCES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. YOU SAID YOU HAD REPORTED FIVE. WELL WHAT WHAT WE THE CAN CALIFORNIA. HAS HAS NOT. A LEAD. AS A HATE AT POINT. BUT WHEN SOME WRITES ME A INPUTS ON THE ON ON SO MEDIA WE HAVE AN OUT. TO PUT AS A PAAS. OUR FORCES. EVEN IF THAT HASN'T BEEN OF NUMEROUS SUCH WE WILL COUNT AS A WHITE SUPREMACIST IT IN THAT WE HAD POWER WAY FOR INSTANCE THAT EASILY COULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS WE'RE SEEING THESE CLUSTERS OF ATTACKS. SOME OF WHICH COULD BE MASS HOMICIDE INS INSTANCES AND WE'RE SEEING YOUNG PEOPLE WITH NO CRIMINAL RECORDS AND ASSAULT WEAPONS. OFTENTIMES COMMITTING THEM- AND THAT'S DISTURBING AND WISHING THAT NOT ONLY A ACROSS THE UNITED STATES BUT WE'RE SEEING IT INTERNATIONALLY AND YOU DID THE GROUP TO PUT ME IN THEIR AGE THE- THEIR VIDEO. YOUR SEVEN ARRESTS LAST WEEK AND THEY WERE GOING TO GO TO RICHMOND- AND BY THE WAY JUST ONE WITH A QUICK THING UP CERTAIN PLACES DO CAL POLITICS MOTION DON'T WASHINGTON DC FOR EXAMPLE- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS WE'RE GOING TO SEE AN INCREASE. IN IN A POSSIBLY INCREASING BOTH BECAUSE YOUR SEEMS TO BE A CORRELATION TO CERTAIN CATALYTIC POLITICAL EVENTS LIKE ELECTIONS WE HAVE. THIRTY YEARS WORTH OF DATA LOOKING AT THAT. AT OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY JOB WE GO TO COOL. CALLED HER I JUST MOTOR. ASSEMBLY MY GET. JUDGE THIS. GROUP. APPLE QUESTIONS THINK PART OF PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE HATE CRIME THE INTO. IT'S IS THE A CRIME THAT'S WE BIG ISSUE STILL IN. YOU GO BACK TO PATROL TYPE SNOT AND WHAT HAVE IN YOUR COMPUTER GO INTO A IT'S A REPORTS THAT. THAT'S VERY VAGUE IN A BIG THAT'S THE REASON YOU GET THE INFORMATION ON THAT. AND NUMBER TWO DEAL JAY IS TOUGH AND THEY'VE GOT THEIR- HERE HATE INTEREST. TEAM THEY HAVE. OVER BECAUSE- BUT TIME YOU GET BOOKS LIKE. A DEAL WITH IT. THAT'S LATER SO THERE'S THAT'S POP. AND HAVING. VERSUS HAVING LOCALS THAT REALLY DEAL WITH THAT. AND GET THE REPUTATION IN ALL THE TIME. DOING WITH THAT DAY IN AND DAY OUT. AND IT IS FAR AS TRAINING GOES SO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS EVERY TWO YEARS OF TRAINING. AND MOST OF IT IS. THE REFRESHER TRAINING BUT- THERE'S A NAME FOR IN SERVICE. PERSONAL SKILLS PERSONAL SKILLS. SO THAT'S FIRST AID CPR MANDATED BY THE STATE. FIRE IN OTHER COURSES WHATEVER ELSE IS COMING UP AND NOW USED TO FOR SO. YOU HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS EVERY TWO YEARS. YOU'RE PULLING YOUR OFFICERS OFF THE STREET. IS A STATE REIMBURSING BECAUSE IF SOMEONE GOD AND AREN'T WORKING- HOPEFULLY IS COVERED BUT IN MOST CASES NOT COVERED. SO YOU CAN'T REIMBURSE THAT ALSO BEING GODS YOU'RE PAYING OVERTIME. FOR SOME OF THE BACK FILL BEHIND THAT SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'VE GOT MORE MINUTES THIS YEAR FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT'S THAT'S- THE IN. EVERYTHING'S PROBLEMATIC WITH THAT AND HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT. BECAUSE IT WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH DOWN MANDATES. AND FOR MOST MANDATES THERE ARE FUND. IS NOT FUNDED IF THIS LOW PRIORITY- YOUR BOTTOM LINE IS PUTTING COPS ON THE STREET SO. I THINK THE BIGGEST THING ON THE MY TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS. ON THE INCIDENTS. IT'S TOUGH I SAYS THIS NOT A CRIME. SO DOOR THAT YOU'RE DO WITH INTO. OFF SO DIPPING ON WHO YOU ARE. HOW YOU PERCEIVE IT OKAY BECAUSE THREATS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME. AND I'M NOT TALKING TO SAY THREATS WERE I'M GONNA KILL YOU. OKAY IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. A LITTLE GOES JOB BEHIND THAT. YOU CAN THREATEN YOU FIRST NOW RIGHT YOU CAN THREATEN ALL YOU WHAT SO. IT'S A TRAINING ISSUE BUT IT'S HOW DO YOU DO THAT DEFINITION. AND STILL TAKE THAT HUMAN PART OUT OF IT SO IT'S HER SICK THREATS OR ILLEGAL IN IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I WILL BUT I TELL YOU THE THIRTY YEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT. PEOPLE SO THAT ALL THE TIME KILL YOU TO DO THIS. AND THEY DON'T GO TO BECAUSE NOT GONNA GET PROSECUTED FOR IT. SO TERRORIST THREATS. OR TO FLY IT IN THE CERTAIN. MALE SCHEME OF THINGS SO. THAT THAT'S THE REALITY HERE SO WE CAN PASS MORE LAWS BUT- USUALLY DO SO MUCH WITH THAT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO. LET'S STATES. WHEN THE FUN MORE TRAINING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. ASSEMBLY BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER LET ME OUT OF A- IF I IF I MIGHT I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR COLLECTION OF DATA- WHETHER TAKE CRIMES OR HATE INCIDENTS. BECAUSE UNDERSTANDING THIS MILIEU IS- IS THE KEY. TO DOING WHAT I THINK WE DON'T DO ENOUGH OF- AND THAT IS. COMMIT RESOURCES AND AFTER. THE PREVENT BEEN. A HATE CRIMES AND AN ANSWER. THAT A CERTAIN. WE'RE REALLY TO MOVE- MORE TO THAT DISCUSSION- I'M REMINDED OF THE TESTIMONY AND- SAMPER A DINO- WHEN- WE HAD OUR HEARING BACK IN THE FALL. OF THE TESTIMONY OF BUDGET GROUP WHO. A FOR LEADER OF EIGHT NATIONAL WHITE NATIONALIST. OR ORGANIZATION WHO LEFT- I HIS ORGANIZATION AND NOW- DOES OUT REGION SCHOOLS IN A NUMBER OF- OF OTHER- VENUES. OF THAT KIND OF EFFORT I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO REACH OUT TO YOUNG PEOPLE- THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT I THINK- IN THE ONLINE WORLD. BACK IN MY YOUTH- HATE SPEECH HPPEN ON THE PLAYGROUND THAT WAS YOU KNOW THAT WAS THAT WAS WHERE I HEARD IT- AS I WAS GROWING UP BUT I'M SURE MANY OTHERS TODAY IT'S WITH A SET OF HEADPHONES ON YOUR PARTICIPATING IN A- A GAMER CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE ANOTHER. PART OF THE COUNTRY ANOTHER PART OF THE WORLD- BUT YET THOSE MESSAGES ARE ARE BEING SPREAD AND RECEIVED AND- THOSE INCIDENTS IN THOSE CRIMES- CUMULATIVELY IN MY VIEW ARE THE THING THAT ARE LEADING TO GREATER VIOLENCE IN SOCIETY TODAY. ON THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK- WE DON'T PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO IS UP PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO THE VICTIMS OF HATE CRIMES I WAS JUST YOU KNOW ONE LITTLE- WEALTH FOR THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY IT IT'S GIGANTIC BUT A SMALL SLIVER. OF FOR THE HATE CRIME INCIDENT WORLD IS- OAK- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MULTI RACIAL TRANS GENDER WHO ARE THIRTY THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY. TO OCCUR SUICIDE AND. OTHERS BUT IN MY ALTHOUGH THE IN NOT BE A SHOWING IT THE- A- THAT POPULATE BEING THE VICTOR. OVER AND OVER. OF HATES AND THEN. AND CRY. IS WHAT'S LEADING TO THAT HI ATTEMPTED SUICIDE RATE. THANK YOU VERY GOOD POINT OF ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. WHO WILL MOVE ON TO THE LET ME HOPE YOU HAVE A FINAL CONCLUSION NOW WE ARE HERE ARE THIS OF AND HELP TO. ME TO REDUCE THE HATE. BUT THE THROUGH THE TRAINING THAT YOU TALK ABOUT. SPEND A LACK OF TRAINING YOU ATTRACT BLAME. THIS TRAIN OF THE LAW AND FOR PEOPLE IS IDENTIFY. WHAT ARE THE- HATE CRIMES BUT THE CAN A REDUCE OR MINIMIZE SAYS SUCH A HATE CRIME THAT'S MY QUESTION. WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT IN ALL AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING STATEMENT ON FOURTEEN THIS IS SO JUST A IN ALL OF. ON ON. HUMAN TRAIT THEY THE TEND TO. ISOLATE AND- OTHER THAN THEM THEY HATE THE SOMETHING ELSE OR DIFF DIFFERENT THINGS. SO WHY. DO YOU THINK YOUR EX. WE'RE GONNA CUT IT DOWN AND THEN I WONDER JUST A COMING TO MY MIND. OPPOSITE OF A HATE IS SO MAYBE LOVE. MAYBE PROMOTING. THE THAT THE BEAUTY OF A LOVER TWO CHILDREN RATHER THAN NOT TO HATE. AND HOW HOW DO YOU TRAIN CHILDREN NOT TO HATE EACH OTHER. BUT OPPOSITE R. BA L. IN A SENSITIVITY AND THE BEAUTY OF OUR LOVE IN A THAT MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE A HAVE YOU DONE ANY STUDY IN THAT KIND OF THING AREAS SO HOW TO REDUCE AND OF WHAT THE METHODOLOGY HISTORY YOU MAY PROPOSE. WHAT ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OFFEND. BY ANYONE TO AMOL BUT I IT WAS I THINK ENFORCEMENT HAVE HAD AN IMPACT WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE IT AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE GETTING PIECES OF THE JIGSAW PUZZLE NOT THE WHOLE PUZZLE. BUT WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN IN THE PROPERTY HATE CRIMES FOR INSTANCE ALSO UP WHEN WE HAVE SCHOOLS THAT ARE PROMOTE TOLERANCE- I THINK THAT CREATES A NICE ENVIRONMENT BUT WITH WITH REGARD TO TRAINING IT'S IMPERATIVE. THAT THESE CASES ARE COMMON TO LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T WE SOMETIMES SEE THEM OCCUR SEE REALLY WITH ESCALATING A SEVERITY ALSO. MENTAL HEALTH ON THERE A LOT FOLKS WERE YOU KNOW THE HARD CORE WHICH YOU'RE VERY SMALL SLIVER OF OFFENDERS BUT THE MAKE UP THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE HOMICIDAL OFFENDERS. ON AND THE TALK ABOUT ONCE THE REFORMED- THE ONES THAT HAVE COMMITTED VIOLENT CRIMES HOW THERE WAS NO WAR FRAM FOR THEM TO GO WITH NOTHING IN THEM THE MENTAL HEALTH WORLD WHERE SOMEONE WHO IS- DYED IN THE WOOL WHITE SUPREMACIST TO GO. BUT WITH REGARD TO- TO TRADITIONALLY MOST HATE CRIMES WERE DONE BY WHAT LEVIN THE MCDEVITT ANOTHER WEAPON A COLD FOR REAL OFFENDERS AND THEY HAVE VERY SHALLOW PREJUDICES THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE OFTEN INTOXICATED AND THEY'RE SEEKING PEER VALIDATION. THOSE FOLKS ARE WILL BE DETERRED BY THESE TYPES OF CRIMES ABOUT THESE TYPES OF STATUTE. THE MISSION OFFENDERS THOSE PEOPLE ARE MUCH HARDER. TO DISCOURAGE THEY HAVE TO BE INTERDICTED AND IS GETTING INCREASINGLY HARD BECAUSE WE HAD A FRAGMENTED SOCIAL MEDIA WERE FOLKS COMING TO THE TOP OF THE FUNNEL AS A- PROFESSOR. WON SAID AND THEN THEY GO DE INTO THE RABBIT. WHICH IS INCREASE. ON A STOVE PIPE SO WE'RE SEEING FRANCES LIKED THE- ENCRYPTED PLACES LIKE TELEGRAM HAD THE SMALL SUB CULTURES OF. TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE ARE ANY DAMAGED ACROSS BORDERS SO THAT'S A THAT'S A DIFFICULTY WE'RE HAVING WE HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OFFENDERS FROM THE- THIS THE SHALLOW PREJUDICES ALL THE WAY- TO. MENTALLY ILL FOLKS AS WELL AS WHAT WAS CALLED THE MISSION OFFENDERS AND THOSE FOLKS ARE INVOLVED IN WEAPONS PROCUREMENT AND THEY BELIEVE THAT THEIR WARRIORS OFFER THEIR GROUP AND THEY WILL STOP. AT NOTHING SHORT OF VIOLENCE. THANK YOU THANK SO MUCH ONE WITH OF THE PANEL. AND ALSO THE THIRD SAW COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. BROWN FROM MIKE HERE WELL MOVING ON TO THE NEXT I KNOW. WOULD THE TWO WILL BE NOW. AND LOOK AHEAD. EFFORTS WHO ADDRESS HATE CRIME LIKE WILL COME CHRIS SON. IS THIS AS TO ATTEND GENERAL AND ALL MONEY WHILE ALVAREZ FROM EXACT OF DURA FROM THE COMING ON PEACE OFFERS DE AND- ON A LOT BUT NOT. ALL THE WAY FOR EPD ALTHOUGH MY- PLEASE JOIN. ALL RIGHT WELL GO FIRST. A ON BEHALF OF THE TOURNEY GENERAL TO SERRA THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO PROVIDE YOU AN UPDATE ON OUR CRITICAL WORK TO ADDRESS SOME PREVENT A CRIMES IN OUR STATE. ALSO WITH ME TODAY ARE MY COLLEAGUES CHRIS RYAN THE CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF OPERATIONS FOR DOJ. AND ELLISON LINDA FROM DOJ SADISTIC CENTER. WE'LL BE ABLE TO ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AGREES BUDGET FOR A CRIME PREVENTION AND ABOUT DOJ'S COLLECTION AND REPORTING OF HATE CRIME STATISTICS. BUT BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN CHIU INSURANCE ALAS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM FOR THEIR TIRELESS COMMITMENT TO HELPING ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN THRIVE REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE WHOM THEY LOVE OR WHAT LOOK WHAT RELIGION THEY PRACTICE. A DOJ WE UNDERSTAND THE CRIMES MOTIVATED BY HATE OR NOT JUST ATTACKS ON INDIVIDUAL INNOCENT PEOPLE. THEY ARE TAX OR COMMUNITIES IN THE ENTIRE STATE. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT DIVERSITY. IS OUR STRENGTH. AND THAT ALL MEMBERS ARE COMMUNITIES DESERVE TO FEEL SAFE. THIS IS WHY DOJ HAS MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT. TO HELP INSURE HATE CRIMES OR INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED. AND TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY RESPONSES THE HIPPIES CONFLICT. I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THE SPECIFIC PROGRESS WE'VE MADE SINCE THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. I WANT TO KNOW THE DOJ TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING HATE CRIMES. AND THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE DIVISIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT WORKING COORDINATION WITH ONE ANOTHER ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THOSE DIVISIONS INCLUDE THE CALIFORNIA JUSTICE INFORMATIONS SERVICES. A OR OTHERWISE KNOWN AS SEIZURES THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OR DALY AND CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT SECTION OR KRESS. FIRST I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT DOJ'S DATA COLLECTION REPORTING EFFORTS. AS WE ALL AGREE CORRECT REPORTING OF HATE CRIMES TO DOJ IS ESSENTIAL TO RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMBATING BIAS MOTIVATED OFFENSES NATIONWIDE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF HATE CRIMES IN CALIFORNIA. HAVING ACCURATE DATA ABOUT WHEN AND WHERE HE CRIMES ARE OCCURRING CAN HELP LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS DOJ BETTER DIRECTOR RESOURCES TO COMMUNITIES ARE BEING THE MOST IMPACTED. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS DOJ HAS ENGAGED IN SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS EFFORTS TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE ARE RECEIVING ACCURATE DATA FROM LAW ENFOREMENT AGENCIES. OR ELEAZAR. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE ESTABLISHING A NEW PROCEDURE WHERE WE PROACTIVELY SEARCH FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT DATA TO US UNDER PARAMETERS SET BY THE FBI. UNDER THAT PROCEDURE WE MAINTAIN A LIST OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY REPORTING AGENCIES. AND I JUST WANT TO NOTE HERE THAT IN TERMS OF REPORTING AGENCIES THESE PARAMETERS ARE SET. BY THE FBI AND THEY'RE VERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS SO IT'S NOT AS IF YOU CAN DO A GOOGLE SEARCH AND DETERMINE OKAY WELL THESE ARE ALL THE REPORTING AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA IT'S A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED PROCESS. PROCESS AND THAT. WE ALSO INSURE THAT ALL OF THE AGENCIES ON THAT LIST REPORT HATE CRIME DATA TO WAS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. INDUSTRY GUIDANCE ON HATE CRIMES REPORTING TO ALL. TO ALL OF THE EARLY EIGHTIES ON THAT LIST. SUBJECT TO AVAILABLE STAFFING WE ALSO CONTINUE TO MAKE PRESENTATIONS TO REPORTING ELLIE ETS TO FACILITATE BUT- HE CRIME IDENTIFICATION. AS ADJUSTABLE REPORTING. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE'VE MADE A DOZEN PRESENTATIONS ON IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING. OF HATE CRIMES THAT STATEWIDE A REGIONAL CONFERENCES REACHING APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THESE TRAINING SUPPLEMENT THE REPORTING TOOLS AND OTHER GUYS WE DISTRIBUTE TO ELLIE ETS ON HOW TO ACCURATELY REPORT HATE CRIMES AND EIGHT INCIDENTS. WE ALSO OF IMPLEMENTED NEW QUALITY CONTROL EFFORTS FOR EACH HATE CRIMES A MISSION TO HELP ENSURE ACCURATE REPORTING. USING THE NEW QUALITY CONTROL PROCESS FOR EACH BE A CRIME REPORTED TO US WE COMPARE THE UNDERLYING INCIDENT REPORT WITH A HATE CRIME STATISTICAL REPORTING SUBMISSION. THIS IS PROVE VALUABLE IN NOT ONLY IMPROVING HATE CRIME REPORTING DID INTEGRITY BUT ALSO IN IDENTIFYING GAPS. FOR USE IN DEVELOPING TRAINING MATERIALS. IF YOU SCHOOL YEAR 200-019-2000 TWENTY DOJ RECEIVED FUNDING FOR FIVE POSITIONS TO AUGMENT OUR HATE CRIMES WORK. BECAUSE OF THIS FUNDING WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HIRE A RESEARCHER TO TRACK AND MONITOR FIRST HAND RESEARCH RECEIVED FROM THE COMMUNITY WHICH WILL BE USED TO DRAFT THE ANNUAL HATE CRIMES REPORT- ISSUED BY THE OJ. AND THE NEXT- HATE CRIMES REPORT FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO DISTRICTS WILL COME OUT IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY. AMONG THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS OF THE RESEARCHERS WORKING ON IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DASHBOARD FOR THE DOJ OPEN JUST AS WEBSITE. THEY ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO PRODUCE MEANINGFUL. STATISTICS AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND VISUALISATIONS OF HATE CRIMES USING DATA. WE'RE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING FOR ADDITIONAL POSITION TO AUGMENT THE HATE CRIME IDENTIFICATION TRAINING EFFORTS THAT I MENTIONED. THESE POSITIONS ALSO ASSIST IN PREPARING IN COORDINATING THE DISTRIBUTION OF ADVISORY BULLETINS AND ASSISTING WITH THE QUALITY CONTROL FUNCTIONS FOR HATE CRIME DATA SUBMITTED BY THE- RESPECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. ONE THING I WANT TO NOTE IS THAT WHY WE APPRECIATE THE FUNDING FOR THE FIVE POSITIONS AND ARE CONFIDENT THEIR WORK WORK WILL HELP IMPROVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA WE COLLECT. THE REMAINS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT IN ADDITION OF AN ATTORNEY. TO THIS TEAM BECAUSE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE OUR WORK THE TOURNEY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUT REACH AND COORDINATION BETWEEN AMONG HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSIONS SCHOOL OFFICIALS ADVOCATES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND BE ABLE TO ADDRESS ISSUES REQUIRING LEGAL ANALYSIS. IN TERMS OF IMPROVING IMPROVING DOJ'S HATE CRIMES DATABASE. AS MENTIONED BEFORE- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING TO THE F. B. I.'S NATIONAL INCIDENT BASED REPORTING SYSTEM OR NEIGHBORS. OR CURRENTLY ON TRACK TO BE NEIGHBORS CERTIFIED BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR AND READY TO ACCEPT DATA ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ONCE THE TRANSITION TO NEIGHBORS OCCURS OR OR VERSION OF IT WHICH IS CALLED FIBERS. WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT AND REPORT ON MANY ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS OF EACH CRIMINAL INCIDENT. INCLUDING REGION SPECIFIC INFORMATION SUCH AS ZIP CODE. HAVING MORE IN DEPTH DATA ABOUT HATE CRIME INCIDENTS WILL HELP US CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL PATTERNS HOT SPOTS. CROSS JURISDICTIONAL INCIDENTS AND DISTRIBUTE NOTICES TO THE RELEVANT ELLIE ETS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS. NEXT I'M GONNA DISCUSS SOME OF THE WORK BEING DONE BY DOJ'S DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. FIRST AS RECOMMENDED BY THE AUDITOR WERE WORKING TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE TOURNEY GENERAL'S HATE CRIME RAPID RESPONSE TEAM. FOR THOSE OF YOUR LESS FAMILIAR WITH THE RAPID RESPONSE TEAM THE TEAM IS COMPOSED OF DOJ SENIOR OFFICIALS WHO CAN ACT QUICKLY TO ASSIST LOCAL AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AUTHORITIES IN THE IDENTIFICATION ARREST PROSECUTION AND CONVICTION OF THE PERPETRATORS OF HATE CRIMES. THE TEAM IS ON CALL AT ALL TIMES. IT'S IMPORTANT OVER THE DOJ FUNDS THE RESPONSE TEAM. THEIR EXISTIN RESOURCES IF A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURRED THE DOJ WOULD ASSEMBLE PERSONNEL TO HANDLE THE SITUATION WITH THE EXISTING RESOURCES. HOWEVER IF DEMAND INCREASED IT WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO PROVIDE MORE SYSTEMS TO ELLIE ACE. IN RESPONSE TO THE AUDITOR'S CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT AWARENESS OF THE OJ RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO COMBAT HATE CRIMES THE DOJ UPDATED ITS HATE CRIME RAPID RESPONSE PROTOCOL. WHICH INCLUDED AND INFORMATION BULLETIN AND A BROCHURE IN FOURTEEN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND THROUGH A PRESS RELEASE. IN MAY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE LAUNCHED A NEW HATE CRIMES PREVENTION WEBPAGE OFFERING THE PUBLIC AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AN ONLINE PLATFORM TO VIEW RESOURCES AND IN FOR IMPORTANT INFORMATION. THROUGH DEALEY LAW BULLETINS THAT ARE SENT TO ALL ELEAZAR WE ALSO WORK TO INFORM ELEAZAR WILL HATE CRIMES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT THE OJ. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOR EXAMPLE DEAL YOU ISSUED A LAW BULLETIN DESCRIBING ALL THE PENAL CODE SECTIONS RELATED HATE CRIMES. AS WELL STATUTES LIKE THE RALPH ACT IN THE BEING ACT. THE GREAT CIVIL PENALTIES FOR BIAS MOTIVATED UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR. JUST RECENTLY IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE ISSUED A BULLETIN THAT INFORMED ELLIE IS BOTH THE ENACTMENT OF AB IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS CLARIFY THE DISABILITY IS PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IS TEMPORARY PERMANENT CONGENITAL ACQUIRED BY HEREDITY ACCIDENT ADVANCED AGE OR ILLNESS. FINALLY DISCUSS BRIEFLY THE WORK BEING DONE BARS CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT SECTION TO ENGAGE IN OUTREACH TO LOCAL HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSIONS AND ADVOCACY GROUPS REGARDING HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS. DESPITE LACK OF DEDICATED FUNDING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE OJ ATTORNEYS HAVE ATTENDED AND GIVING PRESENTATIONS ORIGINAL HATE CRIME CONVENING SO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND ADVOCATES. MOST RECENTLY OUR CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT SECTION PRESENTED AT A TRAINING THAT WAS ORGANIZED BY THE LA COUNTY COMMISSION ON HUMAN RELATIONS IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. CROSS ALSO REGULARLY ATTENDS THE QUARTERLY NETWORK AGAINST HATE CRIMES HOSTED BY THE COMMISSION. THOSE MEETINGS USUALLY INVOLVE REPRESENTATIVES OF VARIOUS FEDERAL STATE COUNTY CITY ENTITIES LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES NONPROFITS ANOTHER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS. AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WITH DEDICATED FUNDING WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENHANCE THOSE OUTREACH EFFORTS WE COULD ALSO MORE MEANING FULLY ENGAGE WITH LOCAL AND REGIONAL HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSIONS AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. SO IN SUMMARY SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ON IT DOJ HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT STRIDES ENSURING THAT WE'RE RECEIVING ACCURATE DATA FROMLAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ON HATE CRIMES IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU'VE HEARD WE'VE MADE NUMEROUS TOOLS AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HOW TO BETTER IDENTIFY YOUR REPORT HE CRIMES WE'VE ALSO REACHED OUT TO LEASE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE. ELEAZAR AS PART OF OUR IN PERSON TRAINING EFFORTS AND ONE ON ONE OUT REACH. IN ADDITION BASED ON FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVED WE'VE HIRED A RESEARCHER THAT WILL PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH GUIDANCE RELATED TO HATE CRIME ANALYSIS INTERPRETATION REPORTING. AN OUT REACH WE'RE WORKING TO RECRUIT IN THE ON BOARD FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF AT CEDARS TO AUGMENT THE DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING EFFORTS WITH ELEAZAR. WE'VE ALSO WORK DILIGENTLY TO ENSURE THE LEDS ARE AWARE OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FROM THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGH THE DOJ HATE CRIMES VENTURE WEBSITE AND DISTRIBUTION OF LAW BULLETINS AND OTHER MATERIALS. AND FINALLY DESPITE THE LACK OF ANY DEDICATED FUNDING ATTORNEYS FROM OUR CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT SECTION HAVE PARTICIPATED. IN AT LEAST READ EIGHT REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE CONVENING OF COMMUNITY ADVOCATES AND LOCAL OFFICIALS. IF DOJ WERE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE CAN STRENGTHEN ALL OF THESE EFFORTS AND DO MORE TO INCREASE ENGAGEMENT WITH VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND WITH HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSIONS AND LOCAL TASK FORCE ON HATE CRIMES. LIKE THE ONE ESTABLISHED THIS PAST FALL BY THE SANTA CLARA BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND AS ALWAYS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO ENHANCE OUR EFFORTS IN ADDRESSING HATE CRIMES IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO MISTER ALVAREZ I WANTED TO RECOGNIZE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BORN IN OR BEST USE JOINING US AND ALSO- SENATOR SCOTT WINNER WAS HERE EARLIER. AND PUT A JOIN US BRIEFLY. MISTER ALVAREZ. I'M SORRY QUESTION HOW WHO REALLY GOING. CAN WE WAIT UNTIL ALL THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN CHIU AND- CHAIR SALAS ALL MEMBERS OF THE STAFF AND ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AT THE HEARING. MY NAME IS MANNY ALVAREZ AND I SERVE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING OR POST HIS WE ARE COMMONLY KNOWN. POST IS COMPRISED OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE TH NEEDS OF THE STATE BY SETTING HIRING STANDARDS. DELIVERING TRAINING. SETTING REGULATIONS AND CONDUCTING AUDITS FOR FORTY ONE POLICE ACADEMIES AND SIX HUNDRED NINE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHICH VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE OPPOSE PROGRAM. APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUEIGHTY THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FULL TIME PEACE OFFICERS AND EIGHT THOUSAND PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCHERS CURRENTLY FALL UNDER THE POST PROGRAM. AS I NOTED IN TESTIMONY A SIMILAR HEARING IN AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN CESAR HOW AND STE AND HER STAFF NOTED TWO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POST IN HER REPORT OF MAY TWENTY EIGHTEEN TITLED HATE CRIMES IN CALIFORNIA. LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS NOT ADEQUATELY IDENTIFIED REPORTED AND RESPONDED TO HATE CRIMES I WON'T READ THE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS SINCE THEY WERE READ- EARLIER IN THE DAY BY THE STATE HONORING HER STAFF. POST POST ACCEPTED THESE RECOMMENDATIONS SINCE MY PREVIOUS TESTIMONY POST REPORTED TO THE STATE AUDITOR ON THE PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS. POSES COMPLETED THE WORK ON THE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THE STATE AUDITOR HAS ACCEPTED THE WORKING CLOSE BOTH RECOMMENDATIONS. WITH THE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE UPDATED THE POST HATE CRIMES MODEL POLICY GUIDE. THE ORIGINAL HATE CRIMES GUIDELINES WERE PUBLISHED IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. THE NEW GUIDELINES REP DATED PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE SECTION FOR TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT SEVEN. AND ONE THREE FIVE ONE NINE POINT SIXTY. THE WORK ON THE NEW GUIDELINES STARTED IN OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND CULMINATED WITH THEIR PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION TO ALL POSTS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ON JULY EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. THE HATE CRIME GUIDELINES CAN BE FOUND ON THE ON THE POST PUBLIC WEBSITE.

AND I ALSO AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH LAST BUT NOT LEAST FOR HOW WELL WE P. THE- MISTER MARTINEZ CHAIR CHIU CHAIR SALAS MY NAME IS ON A MARTINEZ A THE LAPD'S HATE CRIME COORDINATOR. MINE WILL BE MUCH SHORTER. I'M WE- COMPLETED OUR STATISTICAL REVIEW FOR TWENTY NINETEEN. AND HATE CRIMES HAVE INCREASED- TEN POINT 3% SINCE LAST YEAR SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN IT'S ABOUT 40% INCREASE EACH YEAR IS INCREMENTALLY GOING UP ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES- ONE THINGS AT. AT LAPD WE DO TAKE HATE INCIDENT REPORTS- EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NON CRIMINAL REPORTS WE TAKE THEM TO USE THEM TO TRACK TRENDS- WE CAN USE THEM- AS EVIDENCE OF MOTIVATION FOR SUSPECTS THAT ARE LATER ARRESTED. THIS YEAR OUR HATE CRIMES DID NOT INCREASE WE HAD THE SAME NUMBER AS WE HAD IN- TWENTY EIGHTEEN- SOME EXAMPLES OF HATE INCIDENTS ARE- DISPLAYING A **** FLAG WITHIN YOUR OWN HOME THE ACADEMIC TERM OF HATE SPEECH IS NOT A LEGAL TERM SO. ST SEPTIMUS OFFENSIVE BUT NOT A CRIMINAL ACT WE WOULD- TAKE REPORTS ON THOSE IN TRACK THOSE- AT THE UCBCP- TO SHORE COMMITMENT FOR HATE CRIME INVESTIGATIONS WE HAVE TWENTY ONE GEOGRAPHIC DIVISIONS AND FOUR BUREAUS AND EACH DIVISION WE HAVE TO HATE CRIME DETECTIVES. AND ADD SPIRO WE HAVE ONE. I'M COORDINATOR SO WE HAVE ABOUT FORTY SEVEN HE CRIME DETECTIVES THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. WE'VE ALSO CHANGED THE WAY THAT WE LIAISON WITH THE COMMUNITY WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE- WE HAVE CHANGED THE LIAISON FROM THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY TO. FROM THE TERRORISM BUREAU TO OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT GROUP- WE'RE TRYING TO. AS WITH THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS WE'RE USING THE VICTIM CENTERED APPROACH ON HATE CRIME VICTIMS. GETTING ENSURING THAT THEY'RE GETTING THEIR NEEDS MET- JUST AS IMPORTANT AS INVESTIGATING THE CRIME. GIRLS PROVIDING FREE SECURITY ASSESSMENTS TO A RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND ADVOCACY GROUPS THAT REQUESTED AND WE ALSO FOR THE FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM WE SHOW THEM HOW TO COMPLETE- CORRECTLY COMPLETE COMPLETE THE GRANT INFORMATION. FROM KERRY TUCKED BUT THAT- WE CREATED SEVERAL WORKGROUPS WITH THE COMMUNITY TO- IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIPS AND THAT IS WHERE OUR HATE CRIMES SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT CAME OUT OF THOSE OUT OF AB WORK GROUP THAT INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY AND PLEASE- DEPARTMENT MEMBERS THEY CAME UP WITH THE IDEA FOR THAT. SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. I'M POLICING HAS CHANGED- WE DON'T PLEASE STOCKS WE POLICE BEHAVIOR ONE OF THE REASONS THAT CROSS HATE CRIMES GET MISCLASSIFIED IS BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK OF THEM AS HATE CRIMES. A HATE CRIME IS FILING SOMEONE CIVIL RIGHTS BECAUSE OF A PROTECTED CHARACTERISTIC THAT VERY VERY VERY RARELY OCCURS UNLESS AND IN CALIFORNIA WHAT OCCURS IS A BIAS MOTIVATED CRIME AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE PROBLEM. SO THE PENAL CODE SAYS THAT. EITHER IN WHOLE OR IN PART THE BIAS MOTIVATION MUST BE PART OF WHY THE CRIME OCCURRED THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS- CASE LAW SAYS IT MUST BE A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR BUT THAT'S ALL IT SAYS. IS 1% ENOUGH IS 5% ENOUGH DOES HAVE TO BE 51% THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE ISSUE WE HAVE CRIMES THAT ARE BIASED MOTIVATED THAT GET MISS CARE CATEGORY. CATEGORIZED SUCH AS A AN ARGUMENT OVER A PARKING SPOT. TWO PEOPLE GET OUT OF THE CAR START YELLING AT EACH OTHER ONE SPEECH ON THE OTHER YOU HAVE A BATTERY THE PERSON WHO SPENT NOW WALKS AWAY AND THROWS A RACIAL SLUR. AT THE VICTIM. WHAT IS THAT. A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME. SO THAT IS WHY WE HAVE THE I CAN US TEN PEOPLE THAT QUESTION AND I'LL GET. PROBABLY FIVE DIFFERENT ANSWERS SO THAT'S WHY THAT WERE HAVING THE ISSUES WITH THE REPORTS. TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE TRAINING THAT IS CONSISTENT. FOR THIRTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT. THAT WILL EXPLAIN THOSE TYPES OF INCIDENTS WHICH ARE 99% OF OUR INCIDENTS IN LOS ANGELES WE DO NOT HAVE THE. THE WHITE SUPREMACIST- CRIMES. FOR THE MOST PART GOING ON IT'S- ONE ON ONE STRANGER ON STRANGER THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WE ARE MISSING CATEGORY CATEGORIZING. THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN- THE ODD SO. MY LAST POINT IS- SINCE THE SHERRY WENT OVER WHAT THE AUDIT STATED TO MY LAST POINT IS. AT THE LAPD WE HAVE BEEN IMPROVING FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND ARE AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WHERE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY WERE REACHING OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE PROBLEM WE'RE HAVING IS WE'RE ONLY REACHING OUT TO HALF. WE HAVE NOT FOUND IN EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE OFFENDERS. PO PRE OFFENSE. TO IDENTIFY ITS NOT LIKE GANG INTERVENTION WHERE YOU CAN GO INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD TALK TO THE KIDS SHOW THEM THERE'S OTHER WAYS THESE ARE ON LINE MOST UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE- THAT LEARNED AT HOME OR AT SCHOOL OR SOMEWHERE ELSE. HOW TO PEOPLE AREN'T BORN HATING BABY LEARN THIS AND IDENTIFYING THAT AND COMING UP WITH THE PROGRAM THIS EFFECTIVE FOR POLICE IN MY CASE TO TRY TO HELP AND CHANGE THAT I THINK THEY WERE DOING MUCH BETTER WITH THE COMMUNITY OF COURSE THERE'S WORK TO DO BUT FINDING PROGRAMS TO. GET THE IF THERE'S BEFORE THEY BECOME OFFENDERS IS WHAT THE I. P. NEEDS TO WORK ON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- RUDY DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL YES PLEASE IF I MAY- THIS COUPLE QUESTIONS BASED OFF YOUR TESTIMONY AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE START THERE WE- START WITH THE FIRST ONE. BUT WELL LET'S JUST START WITH A MISTER MARTINEZ OF WE CAN'T. HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF ERRORS AND A NUMBER OF ERRORS WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT FROM LAPD FOR INSTANCE NOW IS IT MOSTLY BECAUSE OF. THE PARKING SPOT INCIDENT THE SHOCKING ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW WHETHER WE SHOULD COST FOR THAT IS A GREAT I I'LL GIVE YOU. ONE OF THE ACTORS ONE OF THE HEIRS WILL. ACE A STUDENT AT A TOOL FOR OUT AS IF. IF HE DID NOT MOVE OUT OF THE WAY HE WOULD BE BETTER. BECAUSE OF HIS GLORY. SO HE MISSED CLASS THAT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS ENOUGH. TO BECAUSE HIS FEELING OF IT. THE SUSPECTS NEVER EXPRESSED IT. IN SO DOJ BELIEVE THAT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TIME WE DIDN'T THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT IS THAT TYPE OF INCIDENT IT'S NOT THE SWASTIKA IT'S NOT THE- CALLING A SLUR AND THEN HITTING SOMEBODY IT'S THE BATES NUMBERS THAT WERE THAT WERE HAVING ISSUES WITH. OKAY SO IT'S NOT A LACK OF SUPPORT OF THE INCIDENCES IS JUST THE CLASSIFICATION. OF THEM MY GUESS IS. WHERE THE AIR IS YES WHAT FOR THE ON THE PLEASE DEPARTMENTS PART YES SO THERE IS CHEN THERE IS UNDER REPORTING FROM THE PUBLIC AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF OUR DECADES LONG WHEN I WHEN I STARTED WE WERE AN OCCUPYING FORCE. WE WANTED THEM TO FERRIS THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT IS ANYMORE MMHM WE TRIED TO CHANGE THE CULTURE WE'RE WE'RE DOING WAY BETTER THAN WE WERE. BUT IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD THAT TRUST WITH COMMUNITY WE'RE WORKING HARD TO DO IT AND- AS THE IF YOU LOOK AT OUR STATS YOU'LL SEE THAT ACROSS ALL THE PROTECT THE CHARACTER. SIX THE PERCENTAGE GOING UP THEY THEY KIND OF MATCH EACH OTHER. SO THAT LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS NOT SPATE OF. CRIMES AGAINST A CERTAIN COMMUNITY IS THAT THEY'RE TRUSTING US MORE THINKING WE'RE GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING WE'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE IT AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. SO AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE USED TO GOT IT GOT IT THAT MAKES SENSE AND FOR THE REPORTING SO YOU KNOW YOU GIVE TWO EXAMPLES NOW AND I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- THEY THEN JUST JUDGMENT CALLS BY THE OFFICERS IT'S RESPONDING OR IS IT YOU KNOW THIS THE QUESTION I HAD FOR DOJ WAS YOU KNOW THE AUDIT ALSO IDENTIFIED THE LACK OF COMING UP CLEAR GUIDELINES OUR BEST PRACTICES DOES IT. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE GUIDELINES AND CLEAR PRACTICES BABY FROM DOJ OR IS IT THE YOU KNOW JUDGMENT CALLS OF THE OFFICER RESPONDING TO AN INCIDENT OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. THAT GAP. I BELIEVE IT'S COMBINATION. SO WE ARE UPDATING OUR WE'RE VOLUNTARILY UPDATING OUR HE KIND POLICY AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE ADDING IN IS WE HAVE FIVE LEVELS A REVIEW FOR EVERY REPORT. SO THAT WE DON'T MISS IT. BEFORE IT WAS TOO. IT WAS THE PERSON WHO ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM AND THE SERGEANT WHO READ THE REPORT NOW WE'VE ADDED THREE EXTRA LAYERS SO THAT. HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY CATCHES IT I'M I'M SURE WHEN I CAN BE PERFECT HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY CATCHES IT CORRECTS IT ANOTHER THING THAT WE'RE DOING IS WE ARE- WE COMMITTED TO THE TO BEING TRANSPARENT SO WE HAVE THIS OPEN DATA THING- SO. ANY TIME THAT THE REPORT GETS CODED INTO THE SYSTEM IT'S AUTOMATICALLY POPULATED ON THE WEBSITE SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN SEE. WHAT'S GOING ON WHEN IT HAPPENS IF SOMETHING GETS RE CLASSIFIED TO OR FROM THEY CAN INQUIRE AS TO WHY BUT IT GETS UPDATED REAL TIME TRYING TO BE TRANSPARENT- SO THAT WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT CAN BOOKS GOT IT. ONE COMMENT WRITE ON ON THE DO SIDE AS A MENTIONED WE HAVE- SINCE THE AUDIT- INSTITUTE A NEW QUALITY CONTROL PROCESS BY WHICH WE REQUIRE ALL THE UNDERLYING INCIDENT REPORTS TO BE SUBMITTED TO US- SO THAT WE CAN. DETERMINE HOW HATE CRIMES ARE BEING REPORTED AND IF THEY'RE BEING REPORTED CORRECTLY SO JUST GOING BACK TO THE ISSUES THAT THE JUDGMENT CALL. I THINK THE NUMBER OF SCARY AS THE THAT FOLKS COULD IN THE ROOM COULD COME UP WITH ARE INFINITE RIGHT AND SO I THINK. HAVING THAT INFORMATION THE UNDERLYING INCIDENT REPORT SEEING HOW THEY'RE BEING CODED AND SEEING IF THERE ANY TRENDS. ABOUT MAYBE- YOU KNOW MISINTERPRETATIONS OF THE PENAL CODE STATUTES OR HOW HE CRIMES OR HOW EIGHT INCIDENTS ARE DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER IS CRITICAL TO FIGURING OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE'RE GONNA PUT OUT THERE SO. SO WE ARE WE ARE TAKING YOU KNOW OUR RESPONSE VERY RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE- SINCE THE AUDIT LOOKING AT EASE INTO THE INDIVIDUAL INCIDENT REPORT FOR THE HATE CRIMES MISSION. GOT IT AND THE SUBMISSION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT A UNIFORM. IS A UNIFORM FORMAT S. FOR ALL THE ALLEY ACE. I MIGHT STAND WOULD BE AND I COULD- TO MY COLLEAGUE. THE YEAH YES THE UNIFORM REPORTING FOR GOT A AND SO THEN JUST BASED OFF THE TEST FROM THAN TO NEED TO TREAT THAT FOR AT MORE THING OR WHY THINGS UNDER REPORTED OR NOT REPORTED. I'M JUST A TRAFFIC OUT THE GAP RIGHT FROM YOUR OFFICERS ON THE STREET TO GETTING THE CORRECT DATA TO US GETTING. CORRECTED AT THE STATE TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES SO YOU KNOW WE- I'M GLAD WE- PUT IN THE BUDGET FIVE MORE PEOPLE BUT- ARE THOSE FIVE PEOPLE BEING AFFECTED WITH THE DATA THAT WE HAVE AND I'M TRYING TO. FIGURE THAT GAP OUT THE AUDIT. TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND BECAUSE OF WHAT THE AUDIT FOUND IS WE'VE MADE THESE- MORE LEVELS OF REVIEW REVIEW MADE THE IMPROVEMENTS SEND DIGITAL COPIES OF THE REPORTS TO DOJ- THE- SO THESE ARE THE- THE STEPS WE'VE TAKEN SINCE. THE AUDIT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DID THE AUDIT RIGHT SO WE DID RECEIVE- FIVE POSITIONS AS PART OF THE FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AND ON BUDGET- AND SO THOSE WE HAVE ONE POSITION THAT'S FILLED THE RESEARCHER THAT I MENTIONED- AND THEN THERE'S FOR POSITIONS THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FILLING. AND SO OR FOR. RECRUITMENT EFFORT DID NOT LEAD TO A SUFFICIENT CAñADA POLL WHICH IS WHY WE'RE ENGAGING IN A SECOND ROUND OF RECRUITMENT BECAUSE AS WE ALL GRAY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE EXCELLENT CANDIDATES FOR THE FOR THIS POSITION SO. I ONCE THOSE FOLKS ARE ON BOARD WILL JUST CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO PROVE OUR DATA COLLECTION AND TRAINING. EFFORTS. OKAY YEAH I'M STRANDED AT HOW DO WE THE OF THE REPORTS TO. FIGURE THIS OUT SO THERE IS RIGHT THERE IS THE TRAINING THAT WE'RE DOING ON TO ELEAZAR TO DIRECTLY TO ELEAZAR ABOUT. THIS IS HOW YOU IDENTIFY AND REPORT HE CRIMES- AND THEN THERE WAS ON IT SO THAT'S- I GUESS MAYBE AT THE FRONT END AND THEN ON THE BACK AND- FOR EACH- PRIME. THAT'S REPORTED TO US WE LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING INCIDENT REPORT TO SEE IF IT'S BEING ACCURATELY- ACCURATELY COATED AND IDENTIFIED. I MEAN AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE UNDER REPORTING THAT'S HAPPENING- BECAUSE COMMUNITIES- MAY NOT HAVE THE TRUST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT THEY NEED TO- AND SO THAT'S- A THAT'S THAT'S THE ROLE THAT- AN ATTORNEY FROM DOJ COULD HELP PLAY I MEAN I THINK. IN PARTS OF THE ERROR IS. THERE CAN BE. UP. TO EIGHT. MISUNDERSTANDINGS ARE. WHAT THE- ARE OF ENGAGING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SO FOLKS MAY NOT KNOW THAT TO CALIFORNIA LAW PREVENTS. IN A PEOPLE FROM BEING DEPORTED- AND ENGAGING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THAT. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA LAW PROTECTS IN A VICTIMS SO. I THINK HAVING A DOJ ATTORNEY WHO COULD DO MORE OF THAT WORK- WITH A HUMAN THE LOOK AT THE WITH THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THE HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSIONS. WITH THE ADVOCATES LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD GO A LONG WAY IN INCREASING REPORTING AT THE COMMUNITY SIDE. GOT IT. NOW DOES IT MANTA PLEASE. TELL OUR BECAUSE OF POLICY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE LOCAL AGENCIES ARE NUMBERS MAY NEVER MATCH. TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. FOR MY DEPARTMENT EVERY VICTIM OF A VIOLENT CRIME GETS REPORT NUMBER SO IF YOU HAVE ONE INCIDENT WITH FIVE VICTIMS THAT IS FIVE REPORTS. WHEN I REPORT THAT TO DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT'S ONE INCIDENT WITH FIVE VICTIMS SO I'M GOING TO HAVE FOR MORE THAN THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE ON MY FINAL NUMBERS AND NAMES THAT'S THE WAY I'M NOT SURE WITH- CYBER IS IN. AND DIVERSE WHEN THAT COMES OUT. HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR- IF THAT'S GONNA CHANGE BUT THAT'S HOW ARE REPORTING SYSTEM IS NOW SO I WOULD HOPE WITH SABRES IN A DATABASE SYSTEM WE COULD BE ABLE TO. TEASE OUT THAT DATA EITHER WAY RIGHT. WE COLLECT. AND WE ALSO COLLECTED IN THE LEVEL WE ALSO REQUIRE THE OFFICE LEVEL SO THEY'RE GONNA WIND AND THEN THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GRANT THEN YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT DOES LAW OFFICES AND WE DO REQUIRE ON THE MULTIPLE VICTIMS AND THE MULTIPLE OFFENSES BUT IT STILL ACCOUNTS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A COUNT OF HOW MANY HATE CRIME INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED IN THE STATE. IT'S AT THAT LEVEL. WHERE THE NUMBER THAT'S HAPPENED YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT THE NUMBER VICTIMS RAMBLE AND THEN OF OFTEN. WHERE WE DO WE THAT INFORMATION IS. I THINK WHAT DETECTIVE WORK WAS TRYING TO. AND THEN NUMBER AND HATE CRIMES THAT THEY MIGHT WE OR BASED ON HOW THEY CLASSIFY EIGHT BRIAN. THEIR UNIT. IS THAT THEY'VE DONE ARE YOU DID AND THEY SHOULD MAKE IT BACK TO THE DOCKS WORK SCRUBBING SEAT AND THE NUMBERS COULD BE. BY THAN THEY'RE NOT IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE RECORD FIVE TO LIST THEIR ACCORDINGLY INCIDENT WITH BY THE DOZENS BUT COUNT THE US BY. CORRECT WE'RE COUNTY IS ONE BUT WITH THIS SISTER YOU CAN. CHOOSE WHICH DATA YOU WANT RIGHT SO I COULD EITHER GET BY THE INCIDENCES ARE. BY THE EVENTS. YOU CAN DO THAT NOW. YES I HERS WILL ENHANCE THE CONTEXTUALIZED. GOT IT OKAY GET ALL RIGHT BY THE THEY'LL BE INTERESTING FOR THE AUDITOR FOR TO DO A FOLLOW UP. HOW TO TEASE OUT THE DATA. WRECKED BECAUSE THEN YOU KNOW THEN YOU SEE DIFFERENT TRENDS AND THE NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY A LOT DIFFERENT. GRAY AND THEN JUST ONE MORE QUESTION IF I MAY MISTER CHIU. FOUR DOJ ONLY WAS DRIVERS LONG YOU GUYS IMPLEMENTED ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS APPRECIATE THAT. BUT YOU KNOW FOUR DOJ DOES IT REYES LIKE A RED FLAG FOR YOU GUYS OR DO YOU FOLLOW UPS LIKE YOU KNOW EARLIER WE ARE TESTIMONY OF LIKE SIXTEEN COUNTIES AT IT REPORT ANY INCIDENCES AND I MEAN THAT'S GOT A SEEM ODD GIVEN THE TRENDS EVERYWHERE ELSE AND EVEN NATIONALLY. LIKE THEN DOES DOJ JUST A GREAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS OR DO YOU GUYS JUST SAY NO THERE'S SOMETHING THAT NEED SOMETHING IS GOING ON HERE WE NEED TO GO IN AND ACTUALLY DO THE OUTREACH OR COME UP WITH THE BEST PRACTICES FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THESE. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THOSE COUNTIES ARE IN THOSE SITUATIONS LIKE THAT YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION LINE'S GOING TO FURTHER HELP CAN YOU YEAH. PLEASE USE THE MICROPHONE SO WE CAN REPORT. PART OF THE FOR. IS AGAIN INTRODUCE YOUR- WITHIN. AGENCY THAT WE PEOPLE NOW IN OUR RENDON AT A FOR THE OF TO FOR JUSTICE CENTER. OF THE FOUR POSITION DUTIES THAT WERE WERE PLANNING ON IMPLEMENTING WHEN THEY'RE HIRED IS DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT OF THE AGENCY'S SO WILL NOT ONLY BE LOOKING AT- PRACTICES AND THE- ANOTHER GENTLEMAN HAD MENTIONED THE SECOND HERE. DECISION MAKING PROCESS WHICH WE DO TRAIN ON WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE HOW THAT'S IMPLEMENTED WHAT LEVEL OF STAFF IS PERFORMING THAT WILL ALSO BE LOOKING AT ON THE ONES THAT HAVE HAD IS THERE A REPORT CAN YOU GIVE US A SAMPLING OF YOUR- ART SO WE CAN GO THROUGH AND TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE INCIDENT REPORTS TO SEE MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. REPORTED AS A HATE CRIME AND WHY ARE YOU NOT DOING THAT. GOT IT SO THAT THAT'S WHAT THE NEW POSITIONS THAT WERE JUST RIGHT THAT'S PART OF OUR NEW AUDIT PROCESS SENATE BUT YOU'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING THIS INDIVIDUALS CRACKED. SO WE'RE HOPING TO GET THIS FULL IMPLEMENTED SOMETIME THIS YEAR FROM YEAH. THAT'S FINE. OKAY THANK YOU SORRY MOB MONOPOLY THE TIME. NO PROBLEM THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I WAS GOING TO ASK A SIMILAR QUESTION- IN RESPECT OF THE TIME. OUR TIME IS HAVE A REAL QUICK QUESTION FOR THE- U. P. D. BECAUSE I IN THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR A BILL. TO HAVE A TO A HOUSE THE CHECK BOX IN THE INITIAL REPORTING THE INCIDENT REPORT. TO AND IDENTIFY WHAT IS THIS- HATE RELATED. CRIME YOU KNOW I KNOW THE LAPD HOW TO IMPLEMENT THAT- THAT THAT CHECK BALK. AND ASSUME TENSING WITH HIS HOUSE HE PD. I WAS JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW DO YOU DO YOU FIND THAT EFFECTIVE FOR DESSERTS DO YOU SEE. THE THEIR MORE ACCURATE OR THE INCREASE OF- REPORTING OFF TO HATE CRIME. WAS A CHECK BOX. WE THE COMBINATION. THAT THE CHOI BOXES ON THE FACE OF THE REPORT AND SO THAT ASSIST THE DATA ENTRY FOLKS. ON CORRECTLY ENTERING THE DATA BUT USING THE CHECK BOX IN COMBINATION WITH A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT HAS. VERY MUCH HELP THEIR OFFICERS BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT SURE THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WITH THE QUESTIONS OF. WHAT THE MOTIVATION WAS OF THE VICTIMS PROTECTED CHARACTERISTIC THE REMINDERS OF THE ELEMENTS OF A HATE CRIME THAT THEY CAN JUST READ OFF AND ASKED TO THE VICTIM. IS HELPED A LOT A IN MORE ACCURATELY- CLASSIFIED BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS READ. IT WILL TRIGGER THE CURSE OF A MENTAL REPORTING. YES BY GREAT ARI GOLD SO. IN USE IN WITH IN COMBINATION WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL YES RIGHT I MEAN A MY BILL WAS TO SAY ONCE YOU CHECK THAT BOX AND YOU HOW OBLIGATED TO FILL UP THIS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FILL. THE pAGAIN THIS YEAR AND- OUR- BEFORE WE MOVED TO- TO PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD ALSO WANTED TO- SANK THE POST I MEAN WELL I HAD THE BILL TRUE AND TRYING TO- TRAIN.

FORTY THOUSAND ESTIMATED IS PROBABLY THE AND THE REST OF IT HUNDRED SEVENTY ACTUALLY REPORTED. IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A AWFUL SITUATION UP PART OF SOLVING THAT AND PART OF SOLVING THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF A CRIMES IS UP. POLICE TRAINING AND POLICE FOREIGN POLICIES THE A SOCIOLOGIST FOR A LONG TIME AND HAD THE CONCEPT OF THE LAW ON THE BOOKS AND ALONG THE STREETS OF LAW IT. LAW OF THE LEGISLATURE PASSES LAW THE OFFICERS ACTUALLY CARRY OUT MORE RECENTLY THEY'VE COME UP WITH THE CONCEPT OF THE LAW IN BETWEEN. HOW HOW ART OFFICERS. WHAT THE HELL TO GET ARE ACTUALLY GOT AT THE TWO LA OF IT ARE. TRAINING CONTROL POLICY. MR TING TWO YEARS AGO. PASSED A BILL TO EXPAND THE FORMAL- FORMAL POLICIES THAT ARE IMPORTED INTO HAVE POSED AS A TURN AND IS REPORTED IS HAS DEVELOPED A GOOD- MODEL POLICY THAT DOES THAT. YEAH WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE ADOPTED THERE'S NO THERE'S NO ONE TRACKING AT THE START I CAN TELL. LEAVE THE UP I WANT TO SECOND A PROFESSOR LEVIN'S REQUEST FOR YOUR HELP IN GETTING RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNOR FIVE MONTHS AGO FIVE MONTHS AGO SEVENTEEN SO RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS WROTE THE GOVERNOR ASKING HIM FOR AMONG OTHER THINGS TO ASK THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO ADOPT THE FOR THE POST POLICY PRETTY REASONABLE REQUEST AND ORDER STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO ADOPT THE POLICY WHICH IS REQUIRED BY STATUTE FIFTY MONTH PARTY FIVE MONTHS LATER WE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE I HI ADMIT TO BEING. STRAIGHT IF YOU COULD USE YOUR INPUT IS LEGISLATOR TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE GOVERNOR TO AT LEAST RESPOND TO THE SEVENTEEN TILL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS THAT MADE THIS REQUEST WE WOULD BE VERY. VERY GRATEFUL. THE FIRST LEGISLATION GOES EUROPE YOUR BILL SUPPOSED TO ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL- I THINK EVERYTHING IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING THAT WE LOOK AT THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT- AND THE AUDITOR REPORTS THAT ALL THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT MADE ALL THAT THEY MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO HAVE MADE UP SOME SOME PUBLIC TO PROGRESS TO MEET THEM. OF THE LEGISLATURE- I THINK IF YOU CAN TRY AGAIN TO GET FULLER AND ACTUALLY IN IN ACT ALL OF THE- RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE OTHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WILL THE NEXT WEEK THANK YOU ALL UC AND I'M ADVOCATE FOR TRANSGENDER WOMAN AND GIVEN THE TIME CONSTRAINT I'D LIKE YOUR PERMISSION TO AUGMENT. IT WITH A BRIEF LATER. BASICALLY THE MAIN POINTS I'D LIKE TO MAKE AT THIS TIME ARE MY COMMUNITY FACES INSTITUTIONALIZED HATE. FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS IT'S BEEN ILLEGAL FOR A TRANS WOMAN TO BE IN PUBLIC THE LAWS ACTUALLY READ. NO PERSON SHALL APPEAR IN PUBLIC WEARING THE DRESS NOT ASSIGNED TO THEIR SEX. THE STATE LIBRARY SAYS THOSE LAWS ARE STILL ON AFFECT SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. THAT MEANS LAW ENFORCEMENT DOESN'T GIVE A ABOUT MY COMMUNITY THEY DON'T COUNT AS AND THEY JUST KILLED AB SIX FIFTY THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION. THAT SAID MY LIFE'S NOT WORTH THE CHECK MARK. SO IF A TRANS WOMAN IS KILLED. BY LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY ARE RACES IN MISS GENDERS AND THEIR REPORTS IF THEY COME UPON A CRIME WHERE WE'VE BEEN KILLED THEY ARE RACES AND MISTER ANDERSON REPORT. WE DON'T SET IT ANY OF THESE TABLES DOJ POSE. ANY OF THESE TABLES THERE'S NOT A TRANS WOMAN THERE EVEN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT CLAIM TO ADVOCATE FOR. I THERE'S NOT ONE TRANS WOMAN THAT'S EVER COME UP HERE AND ADVOCATED AYE I SWEAR. I'M THE ONLY ONE. IN IT WE DON'T HAVE A VOICE AND WE DON'T HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE THERE'S NOT ONE TRANS WOMAN EVEN EMPLOYED IN THIS CAPITAL. THERE'S NOT ONE TRANS WOMAN EMPLOYED IT'S THE CITY OF SAN JOSE. SANTA CLARA CLAIMS TO BE THE LEADER THEY'VE GOT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. THEY HAVE TO TRANS WOMEN THAT THEY HIRED FROM SOMEPLACE ELSE THEY HAVE AN ADDED A DROP. SO MY PLEA TO YOU IS ONE ITS ECONOMIC. THAT LET US HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE LET US HAVE A- EMPLOYMENT STOP THIS LEGACY OF THE INSTITUTIONALIZED HATE WHERE WE CAN'T EVEN GO IN PUBLIC. AND THEN PEOPLE WILL SEE THAT WERE JUST NORMAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE TRYING TO GET THROUGH LIFE. THIS THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN AGAINST EVERY COMMUNITY. THE CHINESE THE JAPANESE AFRICAN AMERICANS THE NATIVE AMERICANS. EVERYBODY HAS GOTTEN OFF THAT YOKE EXCEPT FOR MY COMMUNITY AND WE ARE THE LIGHTNING RODS SO I'D ASK YOU. MOST OF THESE STUDIES HAVE NOTHING ABOUT TRANS WOMEN BECAUSE WERE NOT PEOPLE AND WE'RE NOT COUNTED. AB SIX FIFTY WAS KILLED THIS CYCLE. SO WE'RE NOT EVEN A CHECK MARK AND SO IN THEY LUMP IT AS TRANS GENDER WHICH MAKES IT WORTHLESS BECAUSE JUST LIKE THERE'S MEN AND WOMEN AND THIS IS THE BIG DIFFERENCE THERE AND THE TRANS COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION AND TRANS WOMEN ARE OPPOSITES COMPLETE OPPOSITES. TRANSMISSIBLE AND WERE LIGHTNING RODS FOR THE HATE AND LIKE THE NEXT SPEAKER IN THE MUSLIM WOMEN WE ARE THE ONES WHO GET THE BRUNT OF THE HATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING ALL THE WAY TO SANTA CLARA. FROM FROM THE CAR TO SACRAMENTO. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS WHEN SHE SANG AND I'M A SOCIAL JUSTICE FELLOW WITH THE SICK COALITION OUR LARGEST SIX CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION IN THE NATION. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR EFFORTS TO COMBAT HATE ACROSS OUR STATE. IN THE WAKE OF THE MOST RECENT JANUARY THIRTEENTH TWENTY NINETEEN HATE CRIME WERE SICK WE'RE GONNA A HOUSE OF WORSHIP IN ORANGE AVAIL WAS VANDALIZED WITH WHITE NATIONALIST GRAFFITI. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT LONG STANDING ON RESULT CHALLENGES. ACCORDING TO THE SICK COALITION. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST HATE CRIMES AND INCIDENTS TARGETING SIX. IN THE MOST RECENT FBI REPORT AGGREGATING TWENTY EIGHTEEN DATA. THE FBI SIDE SIX AS THE THIRD MOST TARGETED RELIGIOUS GROUP IN THE NATION. YET NOT A SINGLE ANTI SICK HATE CRIME IN THE STATE WAS REPORTED. BY SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY SIX AGENTS IN THE FBI IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT. IF YOU ARE SICK IN THIS THE- AND WE SEE THEM IN THE NEWS ALL THE TIME. AND YET THE DATA CONTINUES NOT TO BACK THAT UP. IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH CORRECTLY IDENTIFYING AND REPORTING ANTI SICK HATE CRIMES. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE COMMUNITY THERE SO THEY ARE SERVE TO PROTECT. WE REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE THE NEXT NECESSARY CULTURAL COMPETENCY TRAINING WITH POST AND ENSURE THAT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE SICK COALITION ARE CRITICAL PART OF ANY HATE CRIME TASK TRAINING INITIATIVES TO COMBAT HE- FINALLY. WE REQUEST THAT LEGISLATORS USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO REQUEST THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO RESPOND TO THE SEPTEMBER FIFTH TWENTY NINETEEN LETTER. CONCERNING HATE CRIMES THAT CIVIL RIGHTS ALLIES WROTE WHICH INCLUDES THE DESPERATE NEED TO INCLUDE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S ERIC HARRIS SOME WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND THERE ARE THREE ISSUES THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A DRESS THAT HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. FIRST INVESTIGATIONS MUST BE THOROUGH DETERMINING THAT A HATE CRIME IS DONE WITH THE SPECIFIC INTENT OF HARMING A PERSON BECAUSE OF THEIR DISABILITY IS DIFFICULT. THERE ARE WELL KNOWN DEROGATORY TERMS AND SYMBOLS USED AGAINST RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. IT IS CRUCIAL FOR IT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO THINK CRITICALLY WHEN INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE HATE CRIMES AGAINST PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. SECOND IT IS ALSO CRUCIAL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE PROPERLY TRAINED AS. RULES OF PROTECT THE CLASSES ESPECIALLY PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. AND FINALLY. ABUSE AND NEGLECT INCIDENTS. A SPECIAL SPECIFICALLY MUST BE INVESTIGATED PROPERLY. IF REPORTED THEY CAN OFTEN LEAD TO MORE SEVERE CRIMES AGAINST INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND THE ELDER COMMUNITY. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN CHIU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATOR FOR YOUR ALL OF YOUR GUYS HARD WORK. AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

WE CAN A THE PANTS ITSELF BEFORE. IT'S AN ISSUE OF BEING MISREPORTED SO FAR MOST IT'S TO ADDRESS CRIMES HAVE BEEN BECAUSE- ORSMAN JUST ACTIONS ALSO BE STRESSED WHEN A ROOT CAUSES A THESE CRIMES SUB CONSCIOUS PREJUDICE OR MORE SO IMPLICIT BIAS AND WE BELIEVE THIS CAN BE BACK OMENS THE EDUCATION CONTENT FOR SUCH A CRITICISM I ARE MORE IS CULTS OF. FURTHERMORE THERE ARE OUR JUNIOR YEAR. THIS WHEN AT LEAST STATE OWES CLASS HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MOST TRANSFORM CLASS TOWARD MY THINKING MIND SET AT WHEN I DISCUSS THE RESULT OF MY PEERS GENERAL CONSENSUS WAS THAT THOSE SOME OF THE TROOPS UNVEILED THROUGH THE IMPLICIT AS UNIT WERE UNCOMFORTABLE. RICHARD THOUGHT WORD NEEDS TO BE FACED AND ONES THAT CHAIN THE WAY WE THANK THAT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT SUPER IMPORTANT AND I THE BIASES THAT ARE CLOSE UP BACK TO. HOWEVER IN THE TOPIC IS A BY TO THE CONVERSATION BE LIMITED JUST TO JUNIOR OR EVEN HOW SCHOOLER. IT BE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO OLD LEVELS. VIEW IMPLICIT BIAS CYCLE IN. EVERYONE HAS. THE MAIN POINT IS THAT THE ART BORN PREJUDICE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S CALLED THEIR EXPIRY. AND IN ORDER TO TRULY ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF HATE CRIMES WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT THESE BIASES FROM SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL AND BECOMING SOMETHING THAT'S RIGHT MANIFESTED. HATE CRIMES AND THEN TO DO THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE CONVERSATION OF THE ADVISED TO THE DECISION. FOR BECOMES A NAY THAT BECOMES OUT OF HAND.

THERE. IS THE SUM OF A HE ON THE OF THE CAL CHAPTER OF THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN RELATIONS I MY COLLEAGUE BEFORE ME HAVE MENTION YOU KNOW THE OVER ENCOMPASS. MESSAGE COMING FROM COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS- BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO- BRING UP- THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW HATE CRIMES IN IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN CALIFORNIA- HAVE BEEN SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT EXISTED YOU KNOW LONG BEFORE THE- HEARING TODAY- MINUTES. THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE NOT ONLY- APPROACHES THAT INVOLVE LAW ENFORCEMENT THANKS IF APPROACH READABILITY IT IS AND- VENTED IF BECAUSE WE SEE THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR NOT ONLY. AMONG ADULT WE SEE THEM CHILDREN. BERMAN TEENAGERS IN HIGH SCHOOLERS OUR STUDY SHOWED THAT OVER 40% OF SUBSTANCE. EXPERIENCE VOTE BASED. EIGHTY I'M IN IS NOT ONLY LIMITED TO MOST STUDENTS MANY GROUPS SIX THESE TYPES OF THIS IN HAITI BASED ACTIONS INTO A ASIANS TOWARDS THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR IDENTITY CITED ENCOURAGE AGAIN- PREVENT AND REHABILITATIVE A WHICH THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT- THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZED IN SO- YOU KNOW YOU HEAR AT THE LEGISLATOR OF THE MINES AND MOUSE PEOPLE- BOAT WE KNOW COMMUNITY ORGANIZING. ARE THE EARS AND EYES THAT YOU KNOW SO ON THE GROUND IN HERE IT'S ON THE GROUND THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH WONDERING HOW. PRESS OF TO ME HE CLASS IN OUR SEE THEM. ALL TRICKLING AND NOW SO GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS THIS YEAR AND ALMOST FROM THE MAY PICKS PROJECT OURS RUN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. AND SO YOUR WHAT MY FELLOW STUDENTS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION IN REFORMING THE WAY THAT WE REPORT THIS FOR THIS BY ALLOWING MORE HATE CRIME DATA TO ACTUALLY REACH THE AYE- ARMED REPORTING. FBI ANNUAL HE- REPORTED BY POLICE OF HER ACROSS THE COUNTRY ONLY LISTS AROUND FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND- REPORTS PER YEAR THIS MEANS THAT MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR. ARE BEING A REPORT THE POLICE. BEING VICTIMIZED. BUT IS REPORTS FEEL. AND THE FBI IS NOT REPORTS. LAW BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF REPORTED BY LONG IS A LOT HIGH THAN THOSE THAT ARE ACTUALLY CALL UP FOR. ACTION SINCE A LOT REQUIRE US TO DEPEND DEFECT AND IN ORDER TO BE PROSECUTED AND SO ON HOWEVER THIS NUYS THE VICTIMS OF CRIME AND LEADS TO SKEW STATISTICS DOES WE EMPHASIZE FOR ALL MORE OUT. OF THROUGHOUT OF FOR MORE TRUE REPORTING FOR THIS OF IT IS SIX BY ACTUALLY EMPHASIZING THE AMOUNT THAT'S OF. EMPHASIZED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A CHANGE THE PENAL CODE- TWELVE OR THIRTEEN OH. OH TWENTY THREE AND SECONDARILY ARE MORE WIDELY PUBLICIZING SUCH STATISTICS ABOUT THE CRIME AND THE WHAT INFORMATION IS BEING COLLECTED WILL ALLOW. ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE SYSTEM. BECAUSE ALL ORGANIZATION SUCH AS ARE PRO PUBLIC OF ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO SHOW THE OPPOSITE ADVOCACY OF RELEASING SUCH A MISSION TO THE PUBLIC. FOLLOWING REPORT ON HE REAL ISSUES WERE BROUGHT IN. WE NEED TO HAVE TOUCH A. HI MARIE AND LETTER TO UP EDUCATIONAL. TO PLEASE ENTER SECTOR. BETSY TO BOSS BY OUR- MAKING AT THE ADMIN SEE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD DO IN OUR- TO RACES HER. I'M FOR MEMBERS OF A AND WERE ARRESTED BUT FOR THE WITH THE RAW. AND ALL OF CAL IN THE- RALLY IN TWENTY. THE PUBLIC NOT ONLY HAS THE RIGHT TO KNOW BUT IT ALSO HAS THE ABILITY. TO THE FOREFRONT AND. I'M ALSO PART OF THE MANY OUT OF THE PROJECT- I GUESS TODAY. A SORT OF TOPIC IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT MY PART OF FROM OF MY- FELLOW. NOT MADE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. MY PAR PRIMARILY THE INDUSTRY OF POLICING AS A WHOLE. OFTENTIMES THE FIELDS AND DISCUSSIONS OF HATE CRIMES WE ALMOST ALWAYS TALK ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT. RESPOND TO A CRIMES BUT THIS PROVIDE THEM SOME. DISTANCE THE ACTUAL PURPOSE GEN OF HEAT IN THE- LONG. A POLICE BRUTALITY ON TARGETING JUST THEM HAVING WAY TOO MUCH POWER THE POLICE THEMSELVES BECOME THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PERPETRATORS OF HATE CRIMES. FROM THE MYRIAD OF KILLINGS OF AND IT'S BLACK FOLKS TO THE SEXUAL. OF QUEER FOLK TO TERRACE. COMES PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME FACE. THE POLICE THEM HAVE ALSO BECOME THE PERPETRATORS OF HATE. AND ANY DISCUSSION OF HOW TO MITIGATE HE CRIME WE HAVE TO START WITH. EVERYTHING AT THE COUNTER. BE PUT IN CHARGE OF MAKING US. THIS IS NOT TO SAY OF. ALL ONE FOR SENATE. THE RATHER THERE'S GENERAL TREND. THERE'S A JET TREND OF. BONTA NEEDS. PERCENT. EVERY TIME I A CAUGHT A GO DOWN MY SPINE MY HEAD GOES DOWN WERE MY PIECE QUICKENS. THE CAN TRUCK THE COP THAT WILL PROTECT FROM THE BOND THAT I WOULD BE. I FIRST HAVE TO TRY THE BEING IN THE- OF. WILL MAKE ME MORE IN THE FOR PLACE. LOOK EACH. BE PRETTY SOME RIGHT WHEN I GO DOWN I SCHOOL TO GO GET A GLASS ABOVE A- I CAN BE. BY THE- OF POLICE IN THE AIR. I CAN HAVE PEACE IN. ONE TOP A MINUTE IN HE- FROM THE CRIMES THAT ARE IN OUR OWN. THANK YOU SO MUCH THE NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE HI WHERE ARE PRIYANKA AND WE ARE THE LAST AND MEDIA FOR. SO AS WE MIGHT PREVIOUS IN THE HERE THE ISSUE WITH HATE ISN'T THE PUNCH PRO BUT SO IN OF MISS BUREAU OF THE TIMES AND WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT AS FAR ON FOR AND INTO THE EDUCATE SPHERE WHICH IS WHERE I FOR RE. OF THE AS YOU RIGHTS AND ACT OR FERPA WHICH DISTORTS DUE TO PRIVACY LAWS AND IT SAYS DO YOU ARE ALWAYS TO REPORT VICTOR. I AM. THE STUDENTS ARE SOUGHT. SHE RIGHT NEEDS A- SALIM ALI. THIS MEANT TO PROTECT YOU PRIVATE. IT BEEN RE MALL. AS A WAY FIRST TO ALL OUT OF ACCOUNT OF. SO ALL. STUDENTS FOR BECAUSE IT LETS SCHOOL OFFICIALS FROM HAVE THEIR TEST TO SECOND GOT. ONE EXAMPLE OF FOR BOTH INSUFFICIENCY IN THIS REGARD WAS WHEN AN AFRICAN AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WHEN PUBLIC A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WITH THE ALLEGATIONS THAT ANOTHER STUDENTS ONE A NEW SET HIM THE KNIFE AND CALLED HIM RIGHT BILL SLURS. WHEN THE STUDENT. AND LOOK MORE THAT THE SUCH. APPROPRIATE HANDLED. IN ANOTHER INSTANCE AFTER THE PARKLAND SHOOTING THE PUBLIC DEMANDED ANSWERS WHETHER OR NOT. APPROPRIATE STATE STEPS WERE TAKEN TO PREVENT SUCH A TRAGEDY FROM HELP. AND AGAIN FOR WAS CITED TO A SCHOOL. TO DODGE LIABILITY. THUS WE BELIEVE POLLUTION NEEDS TO BE PASSED IN CALIFORNIA THAT ADDRESSES FOR BUT OR MORE SPECIFICALLY SEVEN. NINETY NINE THREE ONE ONE I A OF THE LAW. THIS ACTION CUT EXCEPTIONS TO THE PARK SENT- RULE IN VERBA. FOR THE ISSUE WITH. TO MAKE ALL THIS IS FOR DISCO. OPTIONAL FOR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION. AVAIT NON. SURE POLLUTION SEE OUR- IT. MAY SURE THAT WE ARE TAKING ACTIVE LET. STEPS NOT TO STOP. CRIME AND FORSMAN BUT ALSO AT THE ROOT CAUSE. AND WE YOU AS A- FEEL THE SAME. WE WOULD CHANGE THE PHRASE TO MUST DISCLOSE AND THAT IN ITSELF WOULD REDEFINED THE REST OF THE SECTION TO ENSURE OPENNESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
