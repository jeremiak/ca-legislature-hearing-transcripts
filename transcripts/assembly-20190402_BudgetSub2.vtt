00:31:36.527 --> 00:31:38.796
BEEN DRYING FOR FROM JUST OVER

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:41.299

EDUCATION SUGGEST THAT CSU IS

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.806
DRAWING FROM AN EVEN LARGER POOL

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:49.807
TODAY.

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:53.478
LIKELY DUE IN PART TO DRY BEYOND

00:31:53.544 --> 00:31:54.879
THE TRADITIONAL ENROLLMENT POOL.

00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:58.182

00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:12.130

SO OF KNOWING THAT THE

00:32:14.098 --> 00:32:15.733
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO PROVIDE

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.335

00:32:22.173 --> 00:32:23.041
ELIGIBLES.

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:25.143
NOW IF THE LEGISLATURE DID MAKE

00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:27.245
THIS DECISION -- IT WOULD BE A

00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:30.014
GOOD IDEA TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO

00:32:30.081 --> 00:32:31.616
CSU WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE ROLE

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:32.917

HERE?

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:01.672
AS THIS PLAYS OUT.

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:03.207
IT'S REALLY HARD TO PREDICT ANY

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:05.309
TYPE OF NUMBERS AT THIS POINT

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:06.710
SINCE THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:08.379
YEAR THAT WE WILL BE RE RE

00:44:08.445 --> 00:44:10.514
DIRECTING FIRST TIME FRESHMEN

YOU KNOW PREVIOUSLY.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:16.220
WE ONLY REDIRECTED ASSOCIATE

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:18.055
DEGREE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS --

STUDENTS HAVE NOT REALLY TAKEN

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:23.427
ADVANTAGE EVERY DIRECTION SO WE

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:24.595
DO THANK THE NUMBER WILL BE

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:25.896
HIGHER.

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:27.798
BUT WE CAN'T REALLY PREDICT AT

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:28.832
THIS POINT IN TIME [inaudible]

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:30.734
OKAY.

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:32.469
AND THEN MY QUESTION FOR THE LA --

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:34.505
YOU MENTION THAT THAT THE

00:44:34.571 --> 00:44:37.641
POPULATION OF CALIFORNIANS IN

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:39.643
SCHOOL AGE IS GOING DOWN CORRECT

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.577
WE SEE THAT A K..

00:44:40.644 --> 00:44:42.112
TWELVE POPULATION.

00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:43.580
BUT BUT ISN'T THE THE FLIP SIDE

00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:45.115
THAT WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS WHO

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:47.418
ARE EVEN OTHER FEWER ACTUALLY

00:44:47.484 --> 00:44:48.519
HIGH SCHOOL.

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:50.220
GRADUATES THEY'RE MORE GRADUATES

00:44:50.287 --> 00:44:50.921
WHO ARE.

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:53.190
TAKING THEIR A THREE G. COURSES

00:44:53.257 --> 00:44:54.358
AND ARE READY FOR COLLEGE

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:55.993
HIMSELF DOESN'T THAT KIND OF

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.095
EQUAL OUT ARE POTENTIALLY --

00:44:58.162 --> 00:44:58.929
SHOW THAT THERE'S MORE AND MORE

00:44:58.996 --> 00:45:01.932
OF A DEMAND FOR YES THAT'S

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:03.567
HIGHER AT THAT'S CORRECT.

00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:06.470
DECADE AGO OR SO IS ABOUT 34% OF

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.338
HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES HAD

00:45:08.405 --> 00:45:09.640
COMPLETED THEIR A THREE JEEZ.

00:45:09.706 --> 00:45:13.410
AND IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

00:45:13.477 --> 00:45:14.611
FIFTEEN WE LEARNED LAST YEAR THE

00:45:14.678 --> 00:45:15.512
NUMBER HAD GONE UP THE

00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:17.014
PERCENTAGE YOU GOT UP TO ABOUT

00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:19.183
41% OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES OF

00:45:19.249 --> 00:45:21.118
SKEWS THE 43% OF HIGH SCHOOL

00:45:21.185 --> 00:45:22.086
GRADS.

00:45:22.152 --> 00:45:24.121
HAD COMPLETED THREE THREE JEEZ

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:28.959
OF THAT. 81% -- HAD.

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:31.261
WE BEEN QUALIFIED TO GO TO CSU

00:45:31.328 --> 00:45:33.263
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CERTAIN GPA

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.065
OR SAT SCORES THEY NEEDED.

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:37.434
AND BETA WE LOOKED AT FROM THE

00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:38.802
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:40.104
WHICH I MENTIONED MY REMARKS

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.072
INDICATES THAT THAT PERCENTAGE

00:45:42.139 --> 00:45:44.975
IS GONE UP SO IT'S 41%.

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:48.712
IN ONE YEAR 43% ANOTHER 45% AND

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:50.013
OTHER YEAR SO THAT'S CORRECT AND

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.648
LEGISLATURE JUST AS A NO AT THIS

00:45:51.715 --> 00:45:53.984
POINT IF THAT 45% IS GOING TO

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:57.187
KEEP GOING UP FORTY SEVEN FORTY

00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:57.855
NINE FIFTY ONE IF IT'S PEAK TO

00:45:57.921 --> 00:45:59.056
IT'S IT'S NOT CLEAR BUT THAT'S

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:00.424
ABSOLUTELY TRUE IS THAT.

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:02.693
YOU'VE HAD A AN INCREASE IN THE

00:46:02.759 --> 00:46:03.994
PERCENTAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADS

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:05.295
THAT ARE COMPLETING THE RATE TO

00:46:05.362 --> 00:46:07.397
JEEZ IN OUR IN OUR MEETING SEE

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:11.969
ISSUES -- ELIGIBLE REQUIREMENTS.

00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:13.203
AND THEN IF THE STUDENTS --

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:15.672
EXCEPT THE REDIRECTION.

00:46:15.739 --> 00:46:17.774
DO WE ANTICIPATE IF THEY ALL

00:46:17.841 --> 00:46:18.876
ACCEPTED WE ANTICIPATE.

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:20.544
THERE WOULD HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN

00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:21.879
THE BUDGET TO COVER THAT WITH.

00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:22.713
ENROLLMENT FUNDING WE'RE GIVING

00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:25.182
YOU OR HAVE TO COME BACK THE

00:46:25.249 --> 00:46:27.417
NEXT YEAR TO SORT THAT OUT --

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:28.886
FROM A BUDGETARY PERSPECTIVE WE

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:31.421
WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO

00:46:31.488 --> 00:46:32.723
TO FIND EVERY SINGLE STUDENT.

00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:34.224
I KEEP IN MIND THOUGH THAT NOT

00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:35.592
EVERYONE WHO APPLIES TO A C.

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:37.861
ISSUE ENDS UP -- WANTING TO GO

00:46:37.928 --> 00:46:39.129
TO A C. ISSUE RIGHT THERE OTHER

00:46:39.196 --> 00:46:40.030
THE OTHER COLLEGES AND

00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:41.765
UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE AND IN

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:44.801
THE COUNTRY -- BUT WHAT IT COMES

00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:45.836
DOWN TO A RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU

00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:47.471
HAVE IN THE BUDGET SO FAR IS

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:49.006
ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FULL TIME

00:46:49.072 --> 00:46:50.607
EQUIVALENT STUDENTS THAT WOULD

00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:51.208
BE FUNDED UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

00:46:51.275 --> 00:46:53.544
PROPOSAL -- SO THERE'S MONEY

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.412
THERE THAT WE COULD USE TO

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:57.080
ABSORB INITIAL ENROLLMENT THE

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:59.082
OTHER PIECES THAT THERE SOME ONE

00:46:59.149 --> 00:46:59.650
TIME FUNDING IN LAST YEAR'S

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:01.818
BUDGET -- THAT WE HAVE INTENSELY

00:47:01.885 --> 00:47:03.253
HELD BACK KNOWING FULL WELL THAT

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.321
THIS RE DIRECTION POLICY WAS

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:06.456
GOING -- TO POTENTIALLY LAND

00:47:06.523 --> 00:47:08.325
STUDENTS AT OTHER CAMPUSES ARE

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:09.726
PLAN GOING FORWARD IS TO

00:47:09.793 --> 00:47:11.261
ALLOCATE THAT FUNDING TO THOSE

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:13.297
CAMPUSES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS

00:47:13.363 --> 00:47:14.464
SOME OF THAT.

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:17.734
FUNDING GAP IF WE HAVE -- S.

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:20.204
TSUNAMIS SO TO SPEAK OF OF NEW

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.338
STUDENTS ENROLLING IN THE C.

00:47:21.405 --> 00:47:23.540
ISSUES SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE

00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:25.075
SOMEWHAT ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:26.944
BUT IF IT WERE EVERYBODY WANTING

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:27.878
IN.

00:47:27.945 --> 00:47:28.979
I THINK WE WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:30.214
FUNDING IN ORDER COVERED ALL

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:30.948
OKAY.

00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:34.284
AND BACK TO THE TO THE ISSUE TO

00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:35.152
TO USE THE ISSUE AS FAR AS

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:37.054
SERVING.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.855
ALL THE STUDENTS THAT -- ARE

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:40.257
APPLYING.

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:42.659
AT THE DE THE REQUESTED YOU.

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:44.828
HAVE THAT YOU SAY IS A HUNDRED

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:45.596
EIGHT MILLION.

00:47:45.662 --> 00:47:48.031
THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE TO SERVE

00:47:48.098 --> 00:47:49.366
ALL THE THIRTY THOUSAND THAT ARE.

00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:51.501
DENIED EVERY YEAR IT'S CLOSER TO

00:47:51.568 --> 00:47:53.003
TO THAT NO IT'S EQUIVALENT TO

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.571
ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND WRECKED.

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:56.340
AND THEN SO THE DIFFERENCE HERE

00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:57.140
BETWEEN.

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:58.709
WHAT IT IN COURT IN YOUR CHART

00:47:58.775 --> 00:48:01.478
IS THE IS THE ROUGHLY?

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:04.281
WHAT FORTY SIX MILLION RIGHT?

00:48:04.348 --> 00:48:05.782
YEAH THE WHAT THAT THAT THE ONE

00:48:05.849 --> 00:48:07.117
THING THAT WE DON'T WE HAVEN'T

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:08.252
CAPTURED ON THAT WHICH WOULD

00:48:08.318 --> 00:48:09.786
MAKE IT A BIT MORE CONFUSING IS

00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:11.455
THAT WE HAVE WE WITH NEW IN ROME

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:12.489
THAT COMES ADDITIONAL TUITION

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:13.890
REVENUE RIGHT YOU HAVE A MORE

00:48:13.957 --> 00:48:14.691
STUDENTS SO.

00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:15.959
THERE IS THAT PIECE OF IT THAT

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:17.427
FACTORS AND I GUESS A SIMPLE

00:48:17.494 --> 00:48:19.229
QUESTION IS THAT IF WE DID WANT

00:48:19.296 --> 00:48:19.930
TO DO.

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:22.499
THE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND WHICH WE

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:23.066
DO WORK.

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:24.568
THERE IS A NUMBER THAT YOU SAID

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:25.936
IT WOULD COST US NINETY MILLION

00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:26.570
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN YOUR CHART

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:29.473
SAYS WOULD ONLY COST US. FORTY

00:48:29.539 --> 00:48:30.507
SIX MILLION SO WHAT'S THE NUMBER

00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:31.775
RIGHT IT'S NINETY MILLION

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:32.776
DOLLARS WHAT WHAT I'M WHAT I'M

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:34.444
NOT DEPICTING ON THAT SLIDE

00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:35.612
THERE IS THE TUITION REVENUE

00:48:35.679 --> 00:48:36.847
THAT HELPS BALANCE THE ENTIRE

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.882
PLAN THERE SO IT'S NOT A IT'S

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:39.449
NOT A PERFECT GRAPHIC RIGHT

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:41.084
THERE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS

00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:41.718
THAT.

00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:43.020
THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:44.755
CONTRIBUTE ABOUT NINETY NINE

00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:45.722
ALMOST NINETY THREE MILLION

00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:48.158
DOLLARS TO GET 25% ON TOP OF

00:48:48.225 --> 00:48:51.795
THAT ON TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:53.196
PROPOSED AMOUNT YEAH.

00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:54.231
AND THEN -- I THIS IS AN ISSUE

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:55.265
THAT'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO

00:48:55.332 --> 00:48:57.367
TALK ABOUT THAT STUDENT FEES AND

00:48:57.434 --> 00:48:58.969
WE WANT TO KEEP THEM.

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:01.338
AS LOW AS POSSIBLE.

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:03.407
BUT THERE IS A DOWNSIDE TO THAT.

00:49:03.473 --> 00:49:05.742
SO AT AT CSU THE MAJORITY OF

00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:07.911
YOUR STUDENTS ARE EITHER ON CAL

00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:10.047
GRANT OR OTHER OTHER PROGRAMS

00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:11.948
THAT PAY NO TUITION AND WHAT'S

00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:12.616
THE NUMBER AGAIN THAT PERCENTAGE

00:49:12.683 --> 00:49:13.383
ROUGHLY.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.685
I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING IT'S

00:49:14.751 --> 00:49:17.554
ABOUT 60% OF OUR STUDENTS SO60%

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:18.855
HAVE A SUGG AT THE STATE

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:22.592
UNIVERSITY GRANT OR A CAL GRANT

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:23.493
OR YEAH MEANS YEAH.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.462
YES SO OF COURSE WE WOULD LIKE

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:27.864
TO PUT MORE MONEY IN THE BUDGET

00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:30.334
IN -- IN MAY.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.002
HOPING THAT THE TAX RECEIPTS GO

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:33.704
UP AND RIGHT NOW THE ALLEY --

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:34.771
SAYING THAT IT'S NOT LOOKING

00:49:34.838 --> 00:49:35.939
THAT.

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:38.842
THAT FAVORABLE -- SO THAT THAT

00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:40.077
THAT THE DOWNSIDES WE MAKE THAT

00:49:40.143 --> 00:49:41.645
HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY TO

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:43.280
FOCUS ON FULL TIME FACULTY WHICH

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:45.415
ARE GOING TO HEAR -- OTHER

00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:48.352
PRIORITIES LIKE ENROLLMENTS --

00:49:48.418 --> 00:49:50.420
PROJECT REBOUND IDEA OR OTHER

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:50.921
ISSUES THAT WE THINK ARE

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:52.556
PRIORITIES -- IN THE IN THIS

00:49:52.622 --> 00:49:54.925
BUDGET SO THAT THE STUDENT FEE

00:49:54.991 --> 00:49:56.526
ISSUE IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IF

00:49:56.593 --> 00:50:00.130
YOU INCREASE STUDENT FEES BY 4%.

00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:01.531
60% YOUR STUDENTS PAY NO

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:04.901
ADDITIONAL -- MONEY AND THEN --

00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:06.002
YOU KNOW PEOPLE ON THE UPPER

00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:08.138
INCOME OF COURSE POTENTIALLY

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:09.373
COULD COULD PAY FROM AROUND%

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:11.007
SEATED IS THE REALLY THE SQUEEZE

00:50:11.074 --> 00:50:12.342
ON BY FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE.

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:13.977
BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS THAT IS BY

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:16.646
NOT.

00:50:16.713 --> 00:50:18.014
DOING THAT THEN THAT'S ROUGHLY.

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:18.949
YOU KNOW FIFTY OR SO MILLION THE

00:50:19.015 --> 00:50:20.217
YOU DON'T HAVE. TO TO FOCUS ON

00:50:20.283 --> 00:50:21.852
THE GRADUATION INITIATIVES OR

00:50:21.918 --> 00:50:23.653
ISN'T THERE ARE ADDITIONAL

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.055
STUDENT ENROLLMENT SO.

00:50:25.122 --> 00:50:25.655

00:50:25.722 --> 00:50:27.724
THAT -- WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:29.493
THERE'S A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT.

00:50:29.559 --> 00:50:30.761
SO [inaudible]

THANK YOU.

HAVE NARROWED ALBEIT SLIGHTLY

00:51:57.147 --> 00:51:58.181
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE TABLE ON

00:51:58.248 --> 00:51:59.249
PAGE.

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:00.817
EIGHT IN ADDITION DATA INDICATES

THAT STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING

00:52:02.652 --> 00:52:04.321
WITH FEWER ACCESS UNITS WHICH

00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:06.323
RESULTS IN LOWER COST TO THEM

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:07.290
AND THE STATE.

SO OVERALL CSU IS SHOWING

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:13.763
IMPROVEMENT AND A NUMBER OF

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.365
IMPORTANT AREAS PERTAINING TO

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:16.700
STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND IF THE

FOR THE INITIATIVE TO AN

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:26.843
EXPECTATION THE CSU CONTINUE TO

MAKE PROGRESS ON KEY STUDENT

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:30.080

REDUCING EXCESS UNITS.

00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:36.853
AND ONE WAY CSU COULD CREATE A

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.855
BETTER INCENTIVE FOR STUDENTS TO

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:41.358

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:45.028
STUDENTS WOULD BE TO MODIFY A

00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:47.831
POLICY ON CS USE INSTITUTIONAL

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:49.566
GRANT AWARD WHICH YEAH WE JUST

WHICH IS JUST A HUNDRED AND

00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:13.557
TWENTY UNITS.

00:53:13.623 --> 00:53:14.457
ANOTHER WAY FOR CSU TO FURTHER

00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:16.126
REDUCE TEXAS UNITS WOULD BE TO

00:53:16.192 --> 00:53:17.594
LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TIMES A

THE SAME COURSE FOR A BETTER

00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:21.164
GRADE.

00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:23.533
MOST CAMPUSES ALLOW STUDENTS TO

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.468
TAKE THE SAME COURSE FOR UP TO

00:53:25.535 --> 00:53:26.603

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:27.871
AND STUDENTS TYPICALLY ALLOWED

TO REPEAT UP TO TWENTY EIGHT

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.207
UNITS OF COURSE WORK IN THIS WAY.

00:53:31.274 --> 00:53:32.842
SO WE RECOMMENDED NACHMAN OF A

THE SECOND THING THAT I WOULD

00:55:56.686 --> 00:56:00.056
JUST MENTION IS THE FUNDING FOR

REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE.

00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:28.918
ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT -- BY

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:32.188
WAY OF A SORT OF AGGRESSIVE

00:56:32.255 --> 00:56:34.424
POLICY CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:36.326

TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:52.742
STUDENTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:54.244
ASSIGNED TO A DEVELOPMENTAL

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.378
EDUCATION COURSE.

00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:58.915

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.825
DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION COURSE --

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:09.993
THE NUMBER OF THOSE STUDENTS

00:57:10.059 --> 00:57:11.027

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:22.138
WANT TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT --

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:24.174
YOU LOOK AT ANY OTHER STATE --

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.675
AND JUST THE SCALE OF THE SEA

00:57:25.742 --> 00:57:28.044
ISSUE THIS WITHOUT QUESTION HAS

00:57:28.111 --> 00:57:29.112
BEEN THE LARGEST AND MOST

00:57:29.179 --> 00:57:31.114
PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENTAL

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:32.749

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:35.051
THE LAST THING I'LL SAY JUST BY

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:36.753
WAY OF THE FUNDING OF ONE WE

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.087
ESTABLISH THE GRADUATION

00:57:38.154 --> 00:57:39.556
INITIATIVE GOALS WE LOOKED AT

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:42.058
PEER INSTITUTIONS WE ASSIGNED.

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.359
EACH OF OUR TWENTY THREE

00:57:43.426 --> 00:57:44.661
CAMPUSES A SET OF PEER

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:46.262
INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH THE

00:57:46.329 --> 00:57:48.898
GRADUATION RATE TARGETS.

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:51.467
WHAT WE LEARNED IN DOING THAT --

00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:55.638
IS THAT ON AVERAGE THE PEER

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:56.272
INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:57.807

MORE DOLLARS PER PUPIL.

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:03.413
RIGHT THEN THE SEA ISSUE -- AND

00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:04.981
IN MOST CASES THE NATIONAL

00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:07.317
DARLING IN THE IN IN THE COUNTRY

00:58:07.383 --> 00:58:09.886
IS GEORGIA STATE -- BUT IF YOU

00:58:09.953 --> 00:58:11.221
THINK ABOUT IN THE STATE OF

00:58:11.287 --> 00:58:13.223
GEORGIA -- WHERE AN IN STATE

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:15.124
STUDENTS GOING TO PAY TWICE AS

00:58:15.191 --> 00:58:16.960
MUCH AS A AS A CALIFORNIAN WOULD

00:58:17.026 --> 00:58:17.927
PAY?

00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:19.596
AND WE NOW HAVE A NUMBER C.

00:58:19.662 --> 00:58:20.864
ISSUE CAMPUSES THAT ARE

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:23.233
OUTPERFORMING GEORGIA STATE.

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:25.768
AT HALF THE COST OF WHICH IS

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.303
PRETTY REMARKABLE A SOUL OUR

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:29.339

00:58:34.077 --> 00:58:36.379
MOMENTUM THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:39.415
THE LAST -- TWO YEARS I THINK --

00:58:39.482 --> 00:58:41.384
IT WILL SEND A VERY STRONG

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:45.221
SIGNAL -- THAT IF THE STATE.

THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:56.866
WILL ALLOW US TO DO THAT.

00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:57.467
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE THE

00:59:06.743 --> 00:59:08.311
DIFFERENTIAL IN SOME OF THE

00:59:22.725 --> 00:59:24.494
IS IS SIMPLE.

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.095
EXPECTATIONS FROM THE GET GO.

00:59:26.162 --> 00:59:27.497
THEY BRING THE STUDENTS AND WHEN

00:59:29.098 --> 00:59:30.533
THEM.

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.501
HEY IF YOU TAKE TWELVE UNITS A

00:59:31.567 --> 00:59:33.503
YEAR VERSUS FIFTEEN THIS IS HOW

00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:35.872
MUCH WILL MEAN AT THE END AS FAR

00:59:35.939 --> 00:59:37.573
AS HOW MUCH DEBT YOU HAVE AND IN

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.942

IN YOUR IN YOUR FUTURE CAREER.

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.815
SO WHY IS IT SO COMPLICATED

00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:48.217
WIRED SOME OF THESE CAMPUSES.

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:52.188
STEPPING UP LIKE TAXED STATES.

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:53.022
TO WHAT YOU KNOW I THINK ALL OF

00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:55.858
OUR CAMPUSES ARE.

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:57.994
EMPLOYING ACTIVITY UNIQUE TO

00:59:58.061 --> 01:00:01.164

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:11.307

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:12.842
TAX STATUS MEMBER MARKETABLE --

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:14.410
BUT I CAN TELL YOU NOW THAT

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:15.979
SIMPLY EMPLOYING THOSE

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:17.981
STRATEGIES ON DIFFERENT CAMPUSES

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:19.449

THINK YOU SEE A RANGE OF

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:24.787

THAT -- THAT AN ALTERNATIVE

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:17.312

01:18:39.748 --> 01:18:40.682
AMOUNT OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:42.184
USE THEIR OWN FUNDS AND IT

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.718
REDUCE IT BY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

01:18:43.785 --> 01:18:44.619
MILLION.

01:18:44.686 --> 01:18:46.555
IN OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN WE ALSO IS

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:48.590
AN ATTEMPT TO INCREASE THE

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.692
CAMPUS AWARENESS WE PUBLISH THE

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:53.061
BACKLOG BY CAMPUS WE PUBLISH AND

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:54.496
HOW MUCH THEY SHOULD BE FUNDING

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.864
FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON AN

01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:57.232
ANNUAL BASIS.

01:18:57.299 --> 01:18:58.100
AND HOW MUCH THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:00.502
FUND TO ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.270
SO THAT WOULD GO FROM AND AN

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:04.339
ANNUAL NEED OF ABOUT THREE

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:05.874
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION JUST

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:07.342
TO CHIP AWAY AT THE BACKLOG.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:09.010
BUT TO ELIMINATE IT COMPLETELY

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:11.246
OVER TIME WOULD RAISE IT TO OVER

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:12.180
SIX HUNDRED MILLION.

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:14.349
SO AS FAR AS THE CSU PLANNED

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:15.417
COMING UP WITH SIX HUNDRED

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:17.352
MILLION IS NOT VERY EASY GIVEN

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:19.754
OUR OUR PRIORITIES IN A SYSTEM

01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:21.223
IN COMPETING NEEDS.

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:22.557
AS MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY AS

01:19:22.624 --> 01:19:24.226
FAR AS ENROLLMENT COMPENSATION

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:26.094
BRAD INITIATIVE BUT WE ARE

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:27.829
CERTAINLY SOME OF THE PRIEST OF

01:19:27.896 --> 01:19:30.999
OF THE ONE TIME FUNDS THE TWO

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:31.566
HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:32.167
INCLUDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:33.201
BUDGET.

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.270
BUT WE CAN ALSO USE THE THE

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:36.304
PERMANENT BASE FUNDS OF EIGHTY

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:37.772
MILLION THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:39.141
BUT CERTAINLY WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:41.243
HELP US FIND ADDITIONAL DEFERRED

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:42.777
MAINTENANCE OVER TIME.

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:44.045
WITH REGARD TO THE CHILD CARE

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:46.047
CENTERS WE DO HAVE A RANGE OF

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:48.250
CAMPS IS REQUESTING DOLLARS FROM

01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:49.784
A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR PROJECT

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.453
ABOUT THIRTY MILLION SO WE ARE

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.988
STILL COLLECTING INFORMATION AND

01:19:53.054 --> 01:19:54.789
HELP TO COME BACK TO LATER THIS

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:59.161
THE SPRING WITH MORE INFORMATION.

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:00.996
AND A FIRE FINAL PRIORITIES.

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:01.630
AS OF THE LA -- MENTION WE DO

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:03.231
HAVE THE PRIORITY LIST IN -- IN

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:04.466
THE WORKS FOR THE TWO HUNDRED

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:05.467
AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION FOR

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:07.435
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT'S ONE

01:20:07.502 --> 01:20:09.571
OF THE SPEND SOURCES WE HAVE FOR

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:10.906
THAT WE'VE ASKED.

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:12.007
FOR BECAUSE WE TAKE A MULTI

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:13.808
PRONGED APPROACH APPROACH WITH

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:15.277
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NATALIE

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:16.711
USING OUR FUNDS THROUGH

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:18.079
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS BUT

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:19.748
ASKING FUNDS FOR THE STATE AS

01:20:19.814 --> 01:20:21.249
FAR AS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:22.117
AND THEN LEVERAGING THOSE

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:23.718
DOLLARS TO GET THE CAMPUS TO

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:25.187
FUND THAT ADDITIONAL DEFERRED

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:26.321
MAINTENANCE OUT OF THEIR OWN

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:27.689
OPERATING BUDGET.

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:30.325
SO IT IS IT IS A DIFFICULT --

01:20:30.392 --> 01:20:31.927
CHALLENGE IT'S BEEN WITH US AND

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:33.461
ONLY GROWING SINCE I'VE WORKED

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:36.264
FOR THE CSU BUT AM HAPPY -- FOR

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:37.465
THE FUNDING THAT'S IN THE

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:38.533
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND AND

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.669
APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT HAPPY

01:20:40.735 --> 01:20:42.904
ANSWERING QUESTIONS.

01:20:42.971 --> 01:20:44.206
MR O'DONNELL YES THANK YOU THANK

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:45.907
YOU MISTER CHAIR OF IT IS FROM A

01:20:45.974 --> 01:20:47.309
IF WE BACK UP MY CONCERN WITH

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.344
THE CSU SYSTEM AS A WHOLE

01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:49.811
CERTAINLY THE DEFERRED

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:50.478
MAINTENANCE.

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:51.780
AND THAT'S IS SIGNIFICANT ISSUE

01:20:51.846 --> 01:20:53.949
BUT ALSO THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:54.683
FACILITIES IN OTHER WORDS THE

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:55.517
PLANNING.

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:57.185
NOT NECESSARILY THE MICRO LEVEL

01:20:57.252 --> 01:20:59.287
WHAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY -- BUT

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.722
BUT THE PLANNING AND I BRING THE

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:01.957
PERSPECTIVE OF ONE OF GRADUATING

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:03.592
CSU TWICE MY BACHELOR'S OR

01:21:03.658 --> 01:21:06.027
MASTER'S I'M A FAN -- AND BUT I

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:08.630
WALK THROUGH LONG BEACH STATE

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:09.264
JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY WHEN I'M AT

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:10.031
HOME.

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:11.533
THE DOG EARLY IN THE MORNING SO

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.602
I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE --

01:21:13.668 --> 01:21:18.039
AND VARIETY REASONS BUT BUT

01:21:18.106 --> 01:21:18.940
AGAIN DO YOU DO YOU HAVE A

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:20.475
CENTRAL CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THE

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:21.743
PLANNING OF FACILITIES ON THE

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:22.777
CSU CAMPUS.

01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:24.446
SO ON A CAMPUS -- CHEN LINES I

01:21:24.512 --> 01:21:26.414
WANT PLAN SOMETHING IS IT CLEAR

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:27.949
TO SOME OTHER LEVEL OTHER THAN

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:30.218
JUST DECIDED AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL.

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:31.286
IT COMES THROUGH THE

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:33.188
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CAPITAL

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:34.189
PLANNING DESIGN CONSTRUCTION.

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:36.491
SO WE BRING WE COLLECT ALL THE

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:37.859
PRIORITIZE PROJECTS FROM THE

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:39.928
CAMPUSES WE CREATE A FIVE YEAR

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:41.263
PLAN BASED ON WHAT THEY SUBMIT.

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:42.697
AND THEN PRESENT A RECOMMENDED

01:21:42.764 --> 01:21:44.132
PRIVATIZATION TO THE BOARD OF

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:45.734
TRUSTEES AND THAT IS OUR MASTER

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.369
PLAN FOR EACH CAMPUS THERE IS A

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:49.971
MASTER PLAN IN OUR FIVE YEAR

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:50.905
PLAN AS WELL.

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:52.007
SO WHAT ABOUT WHEN I CAMPUS SIZE

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:53.008
THEY WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:54.843
WITH -- MAYBE THE RACE AND

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:56.711
DOLLARS FOR BUILDING IT'S NOT

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:57.345
AND I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT EVEN A

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:58.179
CORE FUNCTION.

01:21:58.246 --> 01:22:00.682
WITH WITH THAT GO THROUGH THE

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:01.850
THIS SENIOR LEVELS IF YOU WILL.

01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:05.353
ANYTHINGOVER 700-100-0700 NINE

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.655
THOUSAND WHICH IS THE DEFINITION

01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:08.290
FOR MINOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:09.257
COMES THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:10.659
OFFICE ONE OF MY CONCERNS ONE OF

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:12.060
THINGS I'M NOTICING IN MAY AND I

01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:12.727
COULD BE WRONG SO PLEASE CORRECT

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:13.395
ME.

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:14.629
AS I SEE A LOT OF EFFORT GOING

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:16.665
INTO RAISING MONEY FOR SOMETHING

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:18.133
THAT MIGHT BE A NOT COR FOR A

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:20.802
NON CORE FUNCTION LIKE AN ALUMNI

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:22.737
CENTER LOBBY STATE.

01:22:22.804 --> 01:22:23.938
WAS VERY CONTROVERSY ON LARRY

01:22:24.005 --> 01:22:25.140
AND I'LL GET TO THAT -- SO A LOT

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:26.241
OF MONEY RACE FOR THAT BUT THEN

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:29.177
THERE WILL BE -- BUILDING LIKE

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:30.178
MOMMY STATE PETERSON HALL THAT'S

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:31.579
IN NEED OF WORK.

01:22:31.646 --> 01:22:33.181
AND I DON'T REALLY SEE AN EFFORT

01:22:33.248 --> 01:22:34.883
ASSOCIATE THE RAISING DOLLARS

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:37.686
FOR THAT -- MAYBE PUTTING

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:38.520
SOMEONE'S NAME ON IT FINE WITH

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:40.322
ME WE GO ACROSS MANY CAMPUS

01:22:40.388 --> 01:22:41.423
UNIVERSITIES NON CSU NON USE

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:43.191
EVEN YOU SEE THAT HAVE DIFFERENT

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:44.259
NAMES ON THEM BECAUSE THE MONEY

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:44.959
THAN RACE BUT THERE.

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:46.328
THEY SPEAK TO THE CORE FUNCTION

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:47.295
OF THE UNIVERSITY THEIR

01:22:47.362 --> 01:22:48.530
EDUCATION RELATED.

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:50.265
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS MAYBE

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:51.032
SOME THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY YOU

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:53.368
KNOW IT'S A CORE FUNCTION CAN

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:54.035
YOU SPEAK TO THAT.

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:55.937
I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:57.906
CERTAIN BUILDINGS DONORS ARE

01:22:57.972 --> 01:22:59.307
MORE INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING.

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:00.508
THERE IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:02.477
EXAMPLE TO GET DONOR FUNDS FOR

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:04.012
AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT.

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:05.947
SO IT MAY BE THAT AND ALUMNI

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:08.383
CENTER ATTRACTS MORE SUPPORT

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:09.718
FROM THE DONORS.

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:11.753
AND AT A PROJECT LIKE A PETERSON

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.988
REPLACEMENT IT MAY BE A NAMING

01:23:14.055 --> 01:23:14.923
FOR THAT BUILDING THAT WOULD BE

01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:16.424
THE OPPORTUNITY OR CERTAIN ROOMS

01:23:16.491 --> 01:23:18.460
THE CAMPUSES ARE TRYING TO

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:20.261
INCREASE THE CO FUNDING FOR THE

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:21.596
PROJECTS WE'VE ASKED.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:24.766
THEM TO PROVIDE A 10% CO FUNDING

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.267
SO WHETHER THAT'S DONOR FUNDS

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:27.802
FOR THEIR OWN IT'S A CHANCE TO

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:31.506
LEVERAGE THE STATE AND SEE IF

01:23:31.573 --> 01:23:32.807
YOU DOLLARS WITH THEIR OWN.

01:23:32.874 --> 01:23:33.641
AND I WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:34.642
HELLO MY CENTERS A WANT

01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:35.610
SOMETHING LIKE REDOING APPEARS

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:36.211
AND HALL WHATEVER IT MAY BE A

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:37.345
CORE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES AND

01:23:37.412 --> 01:23:38.680
NEED.

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:41.516
AND SO MY CONCERNS IT'S SINCE.

01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:42.317
IS WHAT I'M NOTICING I COULD BE

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:42.984
INCORRECT SO PLEASE CORRECT ME

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:43.918
IF I'M WRONG.

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:45.120
IS IT JUST SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:46.588
EFFORT FOCUSING ON THESE NON

01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:48.390
CORE [inaudible]

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:50.325
YOU KNOW.

01:23:50.392 --> 01:23:52.227
FACILITIES AS OPPOSED.

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:54.062
TO THAT CORPS FACILITY WHICH

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:56.231
ISN'T IT IS IMMEDIATE AN

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:57.665
IMMEDIATE NEED OF ATTENTION.

01:23:57.732 --> 01:23:59.300
IT MAY ALSO.

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:01.569
REFLECT THAT FOR ELEVEN I CENTER

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:02.971
WE WOULD NOT PRIORITIZE THAT

01:24:03.037 --> 01:24:06.174
USING STATE DOLLARS OR CSU FUNDS.

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:08.476
BECAUSE IT'S NON ACADEMIC IT IS --

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:10.345
PART OF THE THE FACILITIES

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:12.347
CAMPUSES WANT TO ATTRACT DONORS

01:24:12.414 --> 01:24:13.882
AND SUPPORT THEIR THEIR

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:16.017
POPULATION BASE BUT WHEN WE ASK

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:18.753
THE STATE FOR EIGHTY MILLION TO

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.455
FINANCE ACADEMIC FACILITIES THE

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:21.656
ALUMNI CENTER WOULD NOT BE WHEN

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:21.923
WE WOULD.

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:24.659
AYE AYE INVOLVED IN THAT BUT MY

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:25.293
MY WORRY IS THAT SOMETHING LIKE

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.430
THAT -- THE EFFORT THAT WOULD

01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:29.764
SUCK UP ALL THE ENERGY GEE I

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:31.499
WANT THIS THING AS OPPOSED TO

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:32.600
YOU KNOW I WHAT MY WANT VERSUS

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:34.135
MY NEED MIKE MY MY CONCERN IS

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:35.236
THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT GOING INTO

01:24:35.303 --> 01:24:37.005
WORK ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:24:37.071 --> 01:24:37.906
AS OPPOSED TO MAYBE SPENDING

01:24:37.972 --> 01:24:40.275
TIME ON A CORE FACILITY BUT

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:42.343
THAT'S GOOD THANK YOU AND I WALK

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:44.712
THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY MANY

01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:45.947
TIMES ON A FRIDAY NOBODY'S THERE.

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:47.449
WHAT'S GOING ON ON THAT FRONT TO

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:49.083
INCREASE I MEAN WHEN I WENT TO

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:50.752
LONG BEACH STATE I WAS THERE ON

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:51.686
FRIDAYS.

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:52.954
BUT TODAY IT SEEMS LIKE THERE

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:54.389
AREN'T VERY MANY PEOPLE THERE ON

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:54.989
FRIDAYS WHAT ARE WE DOING TO

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:56.124
ADDRESS.

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:57.592
THE MAXIMUM USE THE FACILITIES

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:59.427

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:01.396
YOU LOOK AT THE CS YOU'VE IS THE

01:25:01.463 --> 01:25:03.331
CSU FACILITIES.

THEY'RE PRETTY HEAVILY AS I GET

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:05.366
THAT BUT PRETTY HEAVILY IS

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:07.502
MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY FROM MY

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:08.970
PERSPECTIVE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH.

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:10.772
WITH THAT I RESTATE CLASSES THEY

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:11.973
GO MONDAY WEDNESDAY FRIDAY.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.741
WHEN IT HAPPENING OUT THERE THAT

01:25:13.808 --> 01:25:14.609
I'M NOT AWARE FROM THIS?

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:16.878
I AGREE WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.580
ENCOURAGE THE CAMPUS IS TO OPEN

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:20.448
UP THE CAMPUSES AND AND THREE OF

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:23.051
OUR TRUSTEES HAVE ASKED US. TO

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:24.886
TO LOOK AT NOT ONLY FRIDAYS BUT

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:26.554
SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS AS WELL SO

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:28.122
ESPECIALLY WITH THE INCREASE

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:29.791
ENROLLMENT HOW WE CAN

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:31.693
ACCOMMODATE THE THE CAPACITY

01:25:31.759 --> 01:25:32.794
PROVIDE ACCESS.

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:33.928
IT SAYS CERTAINLY THINK

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:38.566
SOMETHING THAT THE WOULD BE EASY

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:40.201
TO DO IF WE HAD THE SOMETIMES A

01:25:40.268 --> 01:25:41.135
FACULTY WANTING TO TEACH THOSE

01:25:41.202 --> 01:25:42.604
DAYS SO SOMETHING WE NEED TO

01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:43.505
WORK ON A GOOGLE SEARCH A

01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:45.640
FACULTY MEMBER SCHEDULES AND

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:46.040
THEN A MANAGEMENT.

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:48.843
PROGRAM.

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:50.945
TEENS I THINK WOULD HAVE THE SAY

01:25:51.012 --> 01:25:52.881
ON THAT SORRY.

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:54.215
DEANS OF THE DEPARTMENT I

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:56.518
BELIEVE HAVE THE SAY ON THAT BEN

01:25:56.584 --> 01:26:00.321
AND MIGHT VISITS ALREADY.

01:26:00.388 --> 01:26:02.957
SCHEDULED WAS.

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:04.292
COVERAGE ON THE ACADEMIC SIDE

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:05.860
WILL AND AND BRIAN MAY ALSO HAVE

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:06.461
A RESPONSE BUT IT'S SOMETHING

01:26:06.528 --> 01:26:07.362
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON WE

01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:08.763
RECOGNIZE THAT JUST A LOT OF

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:10.064
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT.

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:11.900
I THINK THE OTHER THING TO ADD

01:26:11.966 --> 01:26:14.769
TO IT IS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW --

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:16.404
A CAMPUS.

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:17.539
MOST OF OUR CAMPUSES ARNETT

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:18.907
CAPACITY.

01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:20.074
RIGHT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE

01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:21.442
FRIDAYS OR SATURDAYS RIGHT NOT A

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:22.710
CAPACITY AND IT'S NOT

01:26:22.777 --> 01:26:25.046
NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF A LOT OF

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:26.214
A LACK OF FACILITIES RIGHT WE

01:26:26.281 --> 01:26:28.116
HAVE LOTS OF FACILITIES AND WANT

01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:28.650
TO SPACE I THINK THE REAL

01:26:28.716 --> 01:26:29.951
CHALLENGE.

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.586
IS BEING ABLE TO FUNDED THAT

01:26:31.653 --> 01:26:33.121
CAPACITY SO IF.

01:26:33.187 --> 01:26:35.089
IF -- WE HAVE I DON'T KNOW HOW

01:26:35.156 --> 01:26:36.457
BIG LONG BEACH IS MASTER

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:38.259
PHYSICAL MASTER PLAN IS BUT IT

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:39.527
COULD BE FIVE OR TEN THOUSAND

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:41.596
MORE STUDENTS COULD PHYSICALLY

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:43.031
BE ON THAT PARTICULAR CAMPUS.

01:26:43.097 --> 01:26:44.465
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE DON'T

01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:47.001
HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES IN ORDER

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:48.369
TO OFFERED MISSION TO SO MANY

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:50.672
MORE STUDENTS WHICH WOULD MEAN

01:26:50.738 --> 01:26:52.040
WE HAVE NOT ENOUGH ROOM.

01:26:52.106 --> 01:26:54.175
ON ON MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY SO

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:55.109
THAT WE CAN.

01:26:55.176 --> 01:26:56.144
PUSH AND FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:57.312
AND OFFER MORE COURSES BECAUSE

01:26:57.378 --> 01:26:58.813
THERE ARE THAT MANY STUDENTS AND

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.181
THAT MANY FACULTY THAT NEED

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:02.083
THOSE LIMITED RESOURCES SO.

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:03.051
IN LONG BEACH CASE IT MAY BE

01:27:03.117 --> 01:27:05.320
THAT THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:06.621
FUNDING IN ORDER OFFER.

01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:09.791
ALL THE COURSES -- THAT WOULD

01:27:09.857 --> 01:27:10.692
NOT THEY HAVE A FUNDING OFFER

01:27:10.758 --> 01:27:11.926
ALL THE EXISTING COURSES BUT

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:13.328
THEY COULD OFFER POTENTIALLY

01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:14.395
MORE IF THERE WAS ADDITIONAL

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:15.263
ENROLLMENT FUNDING OR GRAD

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:16.698
MISSION OF FUNDING OFFERED WHERE

01:27:16.764 --> 01:27:18.299
YOU WOULD SEE MUCH MORE TRAFFIC

01:27:18.366 --> 01:27:20.068
PROBABLY ON A FRIDAY.

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:21.836
I DON'T THAT'S HELPFUL OR NOT

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.705
BUT THE BUT THE POINT IS TO SAY.

01:27:23.771 --> 01:27:26.341
THAT -- YOU YOU NEED THE

01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:28.543
OPERATING FUNDS IN ORDER TO FILL

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:29.877
THAT FACILITY.

01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:31.879
UNDERSTOOD BUT ISN'T IT TRUE

01:27:31.946 --> 01:27:33.348
THAT HE DID OFFER COURSES ON

01:27:33.414 --> 01:27:34.983
FRIDAY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:37.552
THE PRESSURE ON THE FACILITIES

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:40.488
WE BE LESS AND ON AVERAGE.

01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:41.623
SURE YEAH BUT YOU'RE STILL

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:43.891
INCREASING TOTAL HOURS OF USE

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:45.627
CRACKED AND I I RECOGNIZE THAT

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:48.730
BUT THEN THE NECESSITY TO BUILD

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:49.864
MORE FACILITIES.

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:51.432
THE PRESSURE TO BUILD MY MORE

01:27:51.499 --> 01:27:53.067
FACILITIES MIGHT BE LESSEN

01:27:53.134 --> 01:27:54.569
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:57.405
AND AND SO IT ON THE UNIVERSITY --

01:27:57.472 --> 01:27:59.440
CAMPUS ARE ARE ARE THEY SHARING

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:01.709
SPACE.

01:28:01.776 --> 01:28:02.310
I MEAN HOW HOW DOES THIS WORK

01:28:02.377 --> 01:28:04.278
FOR THE THE LECTURE SPACES

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:06.047
TYPICALLY SHARED.

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:08.650
INTERDISCIPLINARY SPACE OF THE

01:28:08.716 --> 01:28:11.419
LAB SPECIFIC TEACHING LAB UPPER

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:12.754
DIVISION MOST LIKELY DID NOT

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.822
EASILY SHARED BUT IN OUR OUR NEW

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:16.457
PROGRAMS WE'RE SEEING CAMPUSES

01:28:16.524 --> 01:28:18.726
WANT GREATER INTERDISCIPLINARY.

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:20.762
MAKER PROJECTS SPACE WHERE THEY

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:22.664
CAN HAVE MORE COLLABORATION THAT

01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:23.231
IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE'RE

01:28:23.297 --> 01:28:25.366
SEEING IN A NUMBER OF THE CAMPUS

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:26.100
PROPOSALS.

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:28.002
OKAY AND THE U. S. -- FOR

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:29.537
GOVERNOR PROVIDES TWENTY FORTY

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:30.071
SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.639
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR TO PAY

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:33.675
FOR CAMPUS BASED CHILD CARE

01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:34.575
FACILITIES.

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:36.010
WITH A CHILD CARE FACILITY BE

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:37.912
SOMEWHAT OF AN ENTERPRISE FUND.

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:38.846
WE DON'T NECESSARILY WHEN SEE

01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:40.448
ISSUES DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY.

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:41.549
TO SERVICE THEIR CORE FUNCTION

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:43.117
NOW ARE WE GONNA PUT THEM INTO

01:28:43.184 --> 01:28:44.218
THE DAY CARE BUSINESS.

01:28:44.285 --> 01:28:45.887
IT IS A BIT OF A MIXED MOST OF

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:49.524
THE CHILD CARE FOR STUDENTS ARE

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:50.158
THROWN THROUGH THE CELL SUPPORT

01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:51.693
PROGRAM.

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:52.226
AND THIS WOULD BE FOR THE

01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:53.995
FACILITY THEY WILL BE CAREFUL

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:55.797
THAT THOUGH THAT'S SAYING NO AS

01:28:55.863 --> 01:28:56.898
MUCH AS WE NEED TO BE VERY

01:28:56.964 --> 01:28:57.398
CAREFUL OF WE'RE GONNA.

01:28:57.465 --> 01:28:58.533
START.

01:28:58.599 --> 01:28:59.801
BUILDING CHILDCARE FACILITIES

01:28:59.867 --> 01:29:01.135
ALL OVER THE CAMPUS WHEN WE

01:29:01.202 --> 01:29:02.637
DON'T EVEN HAVE ADEQUATE

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:04.505
FACILITIES FOR THE STUDENTS.

01:29:04.572 --> 01:29:05.840
WE NEED TO FIND THAT BALANCE

01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:07.208
SENATE EITHER THEIR ACADEMIC

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:09.644
PROGRAMS AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:12.380
KINESIOLOGY -- THAT HAVE

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:14.382
STUDENTS OF AS PART OF THEIR

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:17.151
CLASS ACADEMIC CURRICULUM.

01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:19.320
BUT JUST TO JUST TO ADD TO THAT --

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:21.389
SIMMER O'DONNELL -- ONE THING

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:23.391
THAT WE WE WOULD WANT TO DO AS A

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:25.193
C. ISSUE SYSTEM IS OBVIOUSLY

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:27.228
DEDICATE MOST OF THAT DEFERRED

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:28.830
MAINTENANCE TO THE ACADEMIC

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:30.231
PROGRAM THAT WE JUST WERE

01:29:30.298 --> 01:29:32.400
DISCUSSING RIGHT -- WE ALSO

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:34.702
REALIZE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:29:34.769 --> 01:29:35.503
WOULD LIKE.

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:36.938
A CHILD CARE FACILITIES TO HAVE

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:38.473
STE THAT THERE BE SOME FOCUS ON

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:40.308
THAT AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO

01:29:40.374 --> 01:29:41.909
DOING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BUT I

01:29:41.976 --> 01:29:44.245
JUST WANT TO PUT OUT THERE THAT --

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:46.147
THAT THERE THERE SHOULD BE ANY

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:47.682
CONFUSION THAT WE WOULD.

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:50.218
WE WOULD SPEND SAY MAY MAYBE 50%

01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:51.319
OF THIS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD

01:29:51.385 --> 01:29:52.687
EDUCATION AND THE OTHER HALF TO

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:53.888
ECONOMIC OUR PREFERENCE WOULD BE

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:54.889
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:29:54.956 --> 01:29:56.357
FUNDING IS FOR THE ACADEMIC

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:59.761
FACILITIES AND FOR

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:01.062
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS.

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:02.363
BUT WHEN VICE GROUP IS DONE

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:02.930
ASSESSING THE NEED OF THESE

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:04.065
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:05.399
CENTERS.

01:30:05.466 --> 01:30:06.934
THAT IF THERE IS A DIRE NEED ON

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:10.671
A PARTICULAR -- FACILITY.

01:30:10.738 --> 01:30:12.006
SIGNIFICANT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:13.841
OR OTHER ISSUE THEN WE WOULD BE

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:15.843
MORE THAN WILLING TO TO CONSIDER

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:16.677
THAT IN TERMS OF FUNDING PARTS

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:17.245
OF THAT.

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:18.513
CAN BE AND REMEMBER THOSE ARE

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:19.814
PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO BE.

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:20.848
MAINTAINED IN A MUCH MORE

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:22.483
DIFFERENT FASHION IN THE TYPICAL

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:23.885
CLASSROOM.

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:25.520

STANDARD CLASSROOM.

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:31.926
WHICH WE'VE LET GO.

ALONG THE STATE CAMPUS IS A

01:30:43.671 --> 01:30:44.839
PLACEMENT OF AN ALARM I CENTER

WHERE IT DOESN'T BELONG ABOUT

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.309
THE NEIGHBORS AT MY THROAT --

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:49.577
THE CAMPUS ISN'T BUILT OUT THERE

UPON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SO I

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:18.940

THINK THEY'VE GOT.

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:27.448
A PRETTY LEGITIMATE PERSPECTIVE

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:28.916
WHEN THEY WERE PROMISED SOME

01:31:28.983 --> 01:31:30.785
OPEN SPACE WHEN THE WHEN THE BIG

WELL PARK SITE IS THAT THE ONE

01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:06.254
THAT WILL MY UNDERSTAND IS A

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.455
THERE'S A PROTECT THEIR

01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:08.623
POTENTIALLY GOING TO CONSTRUCT

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:11.158
ANOTHER MULTI STORY DORM --

01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:12.894
ALONG AFTER TEN AT AND WHERE

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.829
THAT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC IS IT

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:15.596
OUT OF THE AREA AROUND THE

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:16.731
UNIVERSITY IS BUILT OUT THERE'S

01:32:16.797 --> 01:32:18.666
HOMES THERE.

01:32:18.733 --> 01:32:20.101
PEOPLE DON'T WANT YOU KNOW.

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:22.770
STUDENTS IN THE FOUR STORY OF

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:23.371
THEIR DORM LOOKING INTO THEIR

01:32:23.437 --> 01:32:23.671
BACKYARDS.

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:26.440
AND THERE'S ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

01:32:26.507 --> 01:32:28.075
THERE TOO AND THERE'S JUST.

01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:29.844
AB IN A THAT THERE ARE PLACES TO

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:31.312
PUT IT I JUST DON'T THINK IT

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:32.480
SHOULD BE A PUTTING.

01:32:32.546 --> 01:32:34.015
THE ATHERTON COURT OR THERE.

01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:36.083
BUT I I WANT TO JUMP ON WHICH

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:37.785
YOU SAID -- MR O'DONNELL AYE I

01:32:37.852 --> 01:32:39.654
KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR FOCUSING

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.722
ON FACILITIES I SUPPORT DOING

01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:44.292
THAT YEAH HI READ BOND.

01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:46.394
I THINK THAT WOULD -- LEVY AT

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:47.361
SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON CSU AND

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:48.930
YOU SEE TO FREE UP SOME OF THAT

01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:50.932
MONEY TO FOCUS ON ENROLLMENT AND

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:52.700
GRADUATION INITIATIVES AND THAT

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:55.102
WORKFORCE FACULTY ALL OUR OTHER

01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:55.903
PRIORITIES.

01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:57.805
BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT PROPERLY

01:32:57.872 --> 01:33:00.041
UTILIZING.

01:33:00.107 --> 01:33:01.175
OUR OUR FACILITIES.

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:04.078
ON EVENINGS ON FRIDAYS AND

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:07.949
WEEKENDS -- IF YOU LOOK AT THESE.

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:09.116
SCANDAL DRIVEN.

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:11.152
YOU KNOW THE NEWS FOR PROFIT

01:33:11.218 --> 01:33:14.655
COLLEGES THE TO FRIDAYS AND

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:17.858
EMPTY EYES AND THE CURRENT THE

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:19.260
IS ONE OUT OF BUSINESS.

01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:20.261
THE REASON THEY DID SO WELL IS

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:20.861
BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO SERVE

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:22.496
STUDENTS AT THEIR TIMES AND IT

01:33:22.563 --> 01:33:23.331
WASN'T ALWAYS MONDAY THROUGH

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:25.299
THURSDAY THE TYPICAL HOURS THAT

01:33:25.366 --> 01:33:26.734
YOU KNOW MAYBE STUDENTS AND LOT

01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:28.369
OF FACULTY WANT TO TEACH -- BUT

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.603
THEY'RE WORKING ON EVENINGS AND

01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:31.105
FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS AND SO I

01:33:31.172 --> 01:33:32.373
THINK THAT.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.041
THAT'S A LESSON TO US THAT

01:33:34.108 --> 01:33:36.577
STUDENTS -- WANT TO GO TO GET

01:33:36.644 --> 01:33:38.412
THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION AT

01:33:38.479 --> 01:33:39.613
DIFFERENT TIMES.

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:41.482
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO STEP

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:42.516
IT UP.

01:33:42.583 --> 01:33:44.685
AND AND HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:46.420
AND THEIR FACULTY MEMBERS YOU

01:33:46.487 --> 01:33:47.755
KNOW GET ON IT IN FOCUS AND

01:33:47.822 --> 01:33:49.223
UTILIZING.

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:52.927
OUR CAMPUSES -- NO.

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:53.527
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AND INCLUDES

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:55.896
THE SUMMER MONTHS AS WELL.

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:57.164
OKAY WE'LL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN

01:33:57.231 --> 01:34:01.936
ISSUE NUMBER -- FIVE CAMPUS

01:34:02.003 --> 01:34:04.305
STUDY.

01:34:04.372 --> 01:34:05.873
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:08.109
MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND

01:34:08.175 --> 01:34:10.011
FOR THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:11.379
TO UNDERTAKE A REVIEW OF A

01:34:11.445 --> 01:34:14.248
POTENTIAL CAMPUS IN SAN JOAQUIN

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:15.583
COUNTY LIKELY STOCKTON.

01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:17.418
THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATES

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:19.253
THAT THIS PROPOSED REVIEW WOULD

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.155
INCLUDE A STUDY THAT EXAMINES

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:22.923
WHETHER A POTENTIAL CAMPUS IS

01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:24.392
MERITED IN THE AREA.

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:27.228
AND OUTLINING CONSIDERATIONS FOR

01:34:27.294 --> 01:34:28.763
PRELIMINARY PLANNING IF SO.

01:34:28.829 --> 01:34:30.464
FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS PROPOSAL

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:31.999
WILL BE PROVIDED WITH THE MAY

01:34:32.066 --> 01:34:34.135
REVISION WITH UPDATED BUDGET

01:34:34.201 --> 01:34:35.036
BILL LANGUAGE.

01:34:35.102 --> 01:34:37.538
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:39.640
QUESTIONS OKAY LA OF AS THE

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:41.675
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST NOTED

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:43.411
THIS ISSUE IS MENTIONED IN THE

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:44.412
GOVERNOR'S.

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:45.980
JAN TEN BUDGET BUT WAS NOT

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:48.015
PROPOSED IN BUDGET BUILDER TRAIL

01:34:48.082 --> 01:34:50.684
OF THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T SEEN

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:52.186
THAT LANGUAGE YET.

01:34:52.253 --> 01:34:53.320
BUT COMING IT MAY REVISE IT

01:34:53.387 --> 01:34:54.688
SOUNDS LIKE SO I'M THINKING

01:34:54.755 --> 01:34:55.589
ABOUT.

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:58.225
THE INITIAL PROPOSAL WE OFFER

01:34:58.292 --> 01:35:00.361
TWO ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:02.163
TO CONSIDER.

01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.763
THE FACT THAT THE

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:05.366
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSING FUNDS

01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:06.133
FOR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.868
GOVERNOR WOULD LIKE TO ASSESS

01:35:07.935 --> 01:35:10.304
CERTAIN CRITERIA CERTAIN FACTORS

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:12.073
BEFORE COMMITTING TO A NEW

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:12.773
CAMPUS.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.742
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT YET

01:35:14.809 --> 01:35:16.744
CLARIFIED WHAT FACTORS IT WOULD

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:18.446
LIKE TO CONSIDER SO WE'LL HAVE

01:35:18.512 --> 01:35:20.347
TO LOOK FOR THAT AS PAGE TWENTY

01:35:20.414 --> 01:35:21.749
THREE OF YOUR AGENDA NOTES.

01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:23.617
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE

01:35:23.684 --> 01:35:25.086
LEGISLATURE ASKED OUR OFFICE TO

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:26.387
ASSESS WHETHER A PUBLIC

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:28.289
UNIVERSITY WAS JUSTIFIED BASED

01:35:28.355 --> 01:35:30.591
ON ONE KEY FACTOR WHICH WAS

01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:32.126
PROJECTED ENROLLMENT AND

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:33.828
PHYSICAL CAPACITY OF EXISTING

01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:34.995
CAMPUSES.

01:35:35.062 --> 01:35:36.664
IN THAT REPORT WE FOUND THAT THE

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:38.099
STATE COULD ACCOMMODATE GROWTH

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:39.700
IN MOST REGIONS INCLUDING THE

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:42.002
CENTRAL VALLEY BY BUILDING OUT

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:43.104
EXISTING CAMPUSES.

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.138
WITH THAT SAID THE

01:35:44.205 --> 01:35:45.773
ADMINISTRATION MIGHT HAVE OTHER

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:48.042
FACTORS IN MIND -- WHICH MIGHT

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:49.677
INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE COMMUTING

01:35:49.743 --> 01:35:52.113
TIME. FOR STUDENTS TO TRAVEL TO

01:35:52.179 --> 01:35:54.115
A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY OR ECONOMIC

01:35:54.181 --> 01:35:56.417
DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOCAL.

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:58.419
STOCKTON AREA SO LEGISLATURE

01:35:58.486 --> 01:35:59.620
WILL WANT.

01:35:59.687 --> 01:36:00.788
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHICH

01:36:00.855 --> 01:36:02.389
FACTORS THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:04.091
LIKE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN

01:36:04.158 --> 01:36:06.794
UNDERTAKING CAMPUS STUDY.

01:36:06.861 --> 01:36:08.195
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:09.330
OF COURSE WILL ALSO WANT TO KNOW

01:36:09.396 --> 01:36:12.233
WHAT EXACTLY THE PROPOSED STUDY

01:36:12.299 --> 01:36:13.467
SCOPE WILL ENTAIL. FOR EXAMPLE

01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:14.535
IS THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:16.837
INTENDED TO COVER FACILITY PLANS

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:19.340
FINANCING PLANS DEVELOPMENT OF

01:36:19.406 --> 01:36:20.608
ACADEMIC PROGRAMS.

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:22.209
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS SO

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:23.444
LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO BE

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:26.480
CLEAR ON WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:27.248
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:28.282
PERFECT PROPOSED DELIVERABLES

01:36:28.349 --> 01:36:29.049

JUST THAT -- I KNOW THIS IS THE

01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:58.305
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND IT WAS A

01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:00.341
PROPOSAL FROM THE CSU THE TWO

01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:02.009
MILLION RIGHT.

01:38:02.076 --> 01:38:03.310
RIGHT WAS A SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:05.980
HAD REQUESTED OR TALK ABOUT.

01:38:06.046 --> 01:38:06.981
WE DIDN'T REQUEST THAT NATURE.

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:09.717

THREE FOUR FIVE TO TO CREATE A

01:38:18.525 --> 01:38:20.961
NEW CAMPUS -- WHEN THERE'S A

01:38:21.028 --> 01:38:22.796
COUPLE JUST STUDENTS OR TO BUILD

01:38:22.863 --> 01:38:24.398
THAT THE EXISTING OFF CAMPUS

01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:25.899
CENTER?

01:38:25.966 --> 01:38:29.303

ADDITIONAL FULL TIME FACULTY.

01:38:34.942 --> 01:38:36.677
AND CAL LOOKING AT THE MODEL.

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:38.846
OF SAN MARCOS VERY THE SET UP AN

01:38:38.912 --> 01:38:40.314
OFF CAMPUS CENTER FROM SAN DIEGO

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:41.782
STATE AND WHEN THEY REACHED A

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:43.617
CERTAIN THRESHOLD HAVE TRIGGER

01:38:43.684 --> 01:38:44.351
TO BECOME.

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:47.354
A FULL FLEDGED CSU CAMPUS.

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:48.656
WELL I THINK WHAT YOU'RE WHAT

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:49.857
YOU'RE REALLY GETTING IT THROUGH

01:38:49.923 --> 01:38:51.158
THAT HERE'S THIS ACCESS RIGHT

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:52.760
DIGITAL ACCESS FOR STUDENTS

01:38:52.826 --> 01:38:54.061
RIGHT.

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:57.364
SO -- IT'S THE MOST DIRECT WAY

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:59.133
TO DO THAT IS TO INCREASE

01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:00.801
FUNDING ON THE GRANDEST OF SIDE

01:39:00.868 --> 01:39:02.836
OR ON ENROLLMENT GROWTH RIGHT

01:39:02.903 --> 01:39:04.171
THAT'S IMMEDIATE.

01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:05.706
THING THAT CONNECT THAT THAT CAN

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:07.708
BRING IN NEW ACCESS TO THE

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:08.809
UNIVERSITY.

01:39:08.876 --> 01:39:11.045
I THINK THE THE SITUATION WITH

01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:12.579
MAYBE A STOCKTON CAMPUS WOULD BE

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:14.548
YOU IF IT THIS WILL BE A DELAYED

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:16.317
OR IT -- A PRO LONG TO SORT OF

01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:17.885
IMPLEMENTATION OF YOU GETTING TO

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:19.820
ACCESS EVENTUALLY RIGHT SO YOU'D

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:21.155
HAVE TO FIRST START LOOKING AT

01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:22.289
WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE AN

01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:24.258
EXPANSION OF THE OFF CAMPUS

01:39:24.325 --> 01:39:24.858
CENTER.

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:27.594
OR A BRAND NEW CAMPUS THEN IT

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:29.163
WOULD THAT ENTAIL LATER ON

01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:31.065
ADDING FUNDING THROUGH GRAD IT

01:39:31.131 --> 01:39:31.899
SHOULD HAVE WARNED ROME THE

01:39:31.965 --> 01:39:32.933
GROWTH FOR ADDITIONAL ACCESS AT

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.169
THAT FACILITY SO IT'S REALLY

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:36.303
KIND OF A TRADE OFF. FOR YOU

01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:37.571
FOLKS IF YOU WANT A INSTANT

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:38.939
GRATIFICATION SO TO SPEAK OF AN

INCREASING ENROLLMENT WITH THAT

01:39:40.374 --> 01:39:42.109
ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR WHETHER

AND BILL CAPACITY IN CERTAIN

01:39:45.179 --> 01:39:46.613
REGIONS OF THE STATE SO IT'S I I

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.215

KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT REAL

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:21.775
PERSONAL INCOME IN THAT AREA IS

01:41:21.842 --> 01:41:23.277
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:49.269
A POTENTIAL CAMPUS --

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:50.471
ACKNOWLEDGING AGAIN THAT THE

01:41:50.537 --> 01:41:53.307
STUDY WOULD NOT NECESSARILY

01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:55.142
PRESUPPOSE THAT THERE IS MERIT

01:41:55.209 --> 01:41:56.477
HAVING THE CAMPUS THERE BUT IT'S

01:41:56.543 --> 01:41:57.811

AS WELL AS WHAT THE PRELIMINARY

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:07.754
PLANNING WOULD LOOK LIKE IF THEY

01:42:07.821 --> 01:42:08.922
WERE TO DO SO.

01:42:08.989 --> 01:42:10.457

INVESTMENTS AND ALL OF THOSE

01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:32.913
AREAS.

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:34.348

HAS SUPPORTED THAT BY INCLUDING

01:54:04.237 --> 01:54:06.206
THOSE ELEMENTS IN OUR RESPECTIVE

01:54:06.272 --> 01:54:07.273
BUDGETS.

01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.608
I THINK IN TERMS OF THE ON GOING

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:09.776
NOTION OF THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

01:54:09.842 --> 01:54:11.678
THAT WE WOULD NEED TO TAKE BACK

01:54:11.744 --> 01:54:14.113
TO OUR BOARD AND OUR LEADERSHIP.

01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:15.281
TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE WANTED

01:54:15.348 --> 01:54:18.518
TO MAKE IT A AN ONGOING SORT OF

01:54:18.585 --> 01:54:20.620
ENDEAVOR AT THIS POINT TIME WE

01:54:20.687 --> 01:54:23.590
FEEL LIKE -- AS AS DR BEVERLY

01:54:23.656 --> 01:54:24.724
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:27.560
ESTABLISHING THOSE PARTNERSHIPS --

01:54:27.627 --> 01:54:30.196
REQUIRES ONE TIME MONIES AND WE

01:54:30.263 --> 01:54:31.264
FEEL THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE

01:54:31.331 --> 01:54:33.299
THE THE BEST USE OF ONE TIME

01:54:33.366 --> 01:54:35.335
MONIES THERE I THINK WHEN IT

01:54:35.401 --> 01:54:36.402
COMES TO ONGOING FUNDING.

01:54:36.469 --> 01:54:38.004
WE PREFER THAT MOST OF OUR ON

01:54:38.071 --> 01:54:40.473
GOING FUNDING GOES -- TO MORE OF

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:42.842
THAT THE CORE MISSION -- FOCUSED

01:54:42.909 --> 01:54:44.611
ELEMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY.

01:54:44.677 --> 01:54:45.945
ENROLLMENT GRAD INITIATIVE

01:54:46.012 --> 01:54:48.648
COMPENSATION THOSE SORTS OF

01:54:48.715 --> 01:54:52.285
THINGS.

01:54:52.352 --> 01:54:56.623
ALL RIGHT SO -- FORGIVE ME IF I

01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:58.024
MISSED THIS BUT YOU WERE TALKING

01:54:58.091 --> 01:54:59.492
ABOUT ONE TIME FUNDING YOU'RE

01:54:59.559 --> 01:55:00.493
TALKING ABOUT.

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.762
THE THOSE THOSE DOLLARS -- BEING

01:55:02.829 --> 01:55:03.830
INTENDED TO EXPAND THE

01:55:03.896 --> 01:55:05.365
PARTNERSHIPS TO ME WHAT WHAT

01:55:05.431 --> 01:55:07.934
WOULD HAPPEN WHEN THOSE ONE TIME

01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:08.468
FUNDS RUN OUT.

01:55:08.534 --> 01:55:10.036
SO THE REASON WE WANT TO CONNECT

01:55:10.103 --> 01:55:11.971
WITH -- AGENCIES IN THE

01:55:12.038 --> 01:55:13.473
COMMUNITY THAT HAVE A TRADITION

01:55:13.539 --> 01:55:15.508
OF WORKING WITH THESE TYPES OF

01:55:15.575 --> 01:55:16.876
POPULATIONS IS SO THAT.

01:55:16.943 --> 01:55:18.344
THEY'RE USED TO RECEIVING ONE

01:55:18.411 --> 01:55:19.279
TIME DOLLARS AND MAKING THEM

01:55:19.345 --> 01:55:21.114
STRETCH AND THEY USUALLY THEY'LL

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:23.783
HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S ALREADY --

01:55:23.850 --> 01:55:26.219
WORKING IN THIS AREA THAT HAS

01:55:26.286 --> 01:55:28.554
EXPERTISE IN REACHING OUT -- THE

01:55:28.621 --> 01:55:30.189
ISSUE WITH ONE TIME FINDING IS

01:55:30.256 --> 01:55:31.691
THAT OUR CAMPUSES ARE NOT I'M

01:55:31.758 --> 01:55:34.460

01:55:34.527 --> 01:55:35.495
WITH THIS.

01:55:35.561 --> 01:55:36.162
YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE FUNDING RUNS

01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:37.664
OUT THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW WHAT

01:55:37.730 --> 01:55:39.299
HAPPENS TO THAT POSITION SO WHAT

01:55:39.365 --> 01:55:40.833
WE'RE HOPING IS THAT BY FINDING

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:42.335
THESE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS

01:55:42.402 --> 01:55:44.003
THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLETO

01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.905
CONTINUE THIS PARTNERSHIP BEYOND

01:55:45.972 --> 01:55:46.939
THE DOLLARS.

01:55:47.006 --> 01:55:48.041
I'M AND THEN WORK WITH OUR

01:55:48.107 --> 01:55:49.709
CAMPUSES TO EITHER GO AFTER

01:55:49.776 --> 01:55:51.944

OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUNDING IN THE

01:55:55.848 --> 01:55:58.084
FUTURE OKAY SO THIS WOULD BE

01:55:58.151 --> 01:55:59.986
KIND OF LIKE.

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:03.289
PROGRAMS.

01:56:03.356 --> 01:56:05.325
AND AND AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A

01:56:05.391 --> 01:56:09.429
VERY -- EFFICIENT -- WAY OF

01:56:09.495 --> 01:56:11.030
STRETCHING THE IMPACT OF OF OF

01:56:11.097 --> 01:56:13.533

CROSS REFERENCING KNOWS AND

01:56:39.492 --> 01:56:40.993
LOOKING AT THE CORRELATION

BETWEEN THOSE AND SOME OF THESE.

01:56:42.595 --> 01:56:46.366
ACT BOB OUT OF CLASSROOM SUPPORT --

THE IMPACT OF SOME OF THESE

01:56:49.469 --> 01:56:51.003
PROGRAMS HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT

01:56:51.070 --> 01:56:53.072
MORE CHALLENGING -- SO WE'RE

THAT THE OUR CAMPUSES ARE

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:05.104
MICROCOSM OF LARGER SOCIETY.

01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:06.572

CAMPUS AS WELL.

01:59:12.311 --> 01:59:14.247
ADD AS MUCH AS WE ARE PROVIDING

01:59:14.313 --> 01:59:16.215
SUPPORTS THOSE ACADEMIC SUPPORTS

01:59:16.282 --> 01:59:17.783
OUR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE

01:59:17.850 --> 01:59:19.752
ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT OUT OF

FOR PROVIDING STUDENTS SO I JUST

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:35.535
THINK YOU KNOW THE COST OF

01:59:35.601 --> 01:59:38.170
LIVING THE COSTS OF ATTENDING

01:59:38.237 --> 01:59:40.573
SCHOOL OF THE COST ALL OF THAT

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:40.773
HAS.

01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:44.644
GONE UP NO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:47.213
THAT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:48.681
STAD -- TAKE.

01:59:48.748 --> 01:59:51.450
YOUR ANTENNAE SO.

01:59:51.517 --> 01:59:53.085
ON TO SOMETHING YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:59:53.152 --> 01:59:55.688
THE STUDENTS FROM FROM DECADES

01:59:55.755 --> 01:59:56.188
AGO IT.

01:59:56.255 --> 01:59:58.357
IT IS DIFFERENT TO IN TERMS OF

01:59:58.424 --> 01:59:59.859
STUDENTS WHO ATTENDED FOUR YEAR

01:59:59.926 --> 02:00:02.161
INSTITUTIONS DECADES AGO VERSUS

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:03.262
TODAY WHICH IS A GOOD THING YOU

02:00:03.329 --> 02:00:07.366

02:00:07.433 --> 02:00:09.268
AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS FROM LOWER

02:00:09.335 --> 02:00:12.038
INCOMES -- SO LACK THERE COULD

02:00:12.104 --> 02:00:13.439
BE SOMETHING THERE.

02:00:13.506 --> 02:00:16.509
ANOTHER SOMETHING INTERESTING OF

02:00:16.576 --> 02:00:19.879
FROM MY MENTIONED UC CONDUCTS A

02:00:19.946 --> 02:00:21.414
SURVEYS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:23.382
WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT. ONE

02:00:23.449 --> 02:00:25.851
QUARTER OF STUDENTS WHO SAID

02:00:25.918 --> 02:00:26.919
THERE.

02:00:26.986 --> 02:00:28.688
CAME FROM FAMILIES EARNING A

02:00:28.754 --> 02:00:29.288
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S SOMEWHAT

02:00:36.963 --> 02:00:41.200
OF A PUZZLE. FOR US IS SOMETHING

02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:42.902
WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND BETTER IS

02:00:42.969 --> 02:00:44.303
IT THE THE FACT THAT IN

GO AS FAR AS AS IT DOES

02:00:50.643 --> 02:00:52.345
ELSEWHERE MAYBE THE PARENTS

CONTRIBUTION.

02:00:58.117 --> 02:01:00.686
COULD BE AN ISSUE OF OF

02:01:00.753 --> 02:01:02.488
UNUSUALLY HIGH COSTS FOR CERTAIN

02:01:02.555 --> 02:01:04.090

I THINK THE ONE THING TO KEEP IN

02:14:24.956 --> 02:14:28.460
MIND -- WHEN IT COMES DOWN -- TO

02:14:28.527 --> 02:14:31.863

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PRESSURES

02:14:33.999 --> 02:14:34.533
AND THERE'S A LOT OF NEED OUT

02:14:34.599 --> 02:14:36.435
THERE RIGHT PROJECT REBOUND IS

02:14:36.501 --> 02:14:37.569
ONE OF MANY GREAT PROGRAMS IS

02:14:41.339 --> 02:14:42.774
SUBGROUPS.

02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:44.910
THE THE THE THE CHALLENGE THAT

02:14:44.976 --> 02:14:47.379
WE HAVE IS A SYSTEM IS IS IF WE

02:14:47.446 --> 02:14:49.047

02:14:49.114 --> 02:14:50.449
THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR

02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:56.555
THINGS.

THAT DOES CIRCUMVENT THE

02:14:57.956 --> 02:14:59.891
PRIORITIES THAT THE PRESIDENT'S%

02:14:59.958 --> 02:15:01.593

DOING IS IS THAT THAT KIND OF

02:15:23.782 --> 02:15:26.284
UNDERMINES OUR PHILOSOPHY A

02:15:26.351 --> 02:15:28.119
