ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. SO WE

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:19.978
DETERMINED BACKLOG BY LOOKING AT

00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:21.980
TWO THINGS. OUR COMPANY FILINGS

00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:23.882
ARE COMING IN AND HOW FAST CAN

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:26.318
THE COURTS PROCESS. IF THE COURT

COMING IN THERE'S A BACKLOG. OF

00:26:29.654 --> 00:26:31.189
THAT BACKLOG IS DRIVEN BY WHAT'S

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:33.425
CALLED CLEARANCE RATE. AND THIS

00:26:33.491 --> 00:26:34.960
IS THE MEASUREMENT OF HOW FAST

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:37.329
THE COURTS CAN PROCESS DEFINED.

00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:38.863
A PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC IF THE

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.699
COURT HAD A HUNDRED FILINGS COME

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:42.934
IN. THEY COULD PROCESS EIGHTY

00:26:43.001 --> 00:26:43.902
SIX OF THEM. WHICH IS A

00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:45.704
CLEARANCE RATE OF EIGHTY SIX

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.772
PERCENT. IT WOULD RESULT IN A

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:49.641
BACKLOG OF FOURTEEN CASE. FOR

00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:51.309
THE OVERALL PANDEMIC PERIOD THE

00:26:51.376 --> 00:26:53.345
FRENCH CLEARANCE RATE IS EIGHTY

00:26:53.411 --> 00:26:54.846
THREE PERCENT. WHICH IS SLIGHTLY

00:26:54.913 --> 00:26:59.017
LOWER THAN THE PRE PENTOMIC

00:26:59.084 --> 00:27:01.386
RIGHT 86% R. FOR THE- ALL- IN

00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:03.021
THE BEGINNING OF THE CLEARANCE

00:27:03.088 --> 00:27:05.523
RATE WENT DOWN ACTUALLY TO

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.125
SEVENTY THREE PERCENT. BUT NOW

00:27:07.192 --> 00:27:08.593
IT'S RECOVERED AND HOVERED

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.529
AROUND EIGHTY SIX THE NOT EIGHTY

00:27:11.596 --> 00:27:12.731
NINE PERCENT. OVER THE PAST

00:27:12.797 --> 00:27:15.133
THREE QUARTERS. IN MOST CASES

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.403
TYPES OF FILINGS ARE DOWN ABOUT

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.172
34% COMPARED TO PRE PANDEMIC

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:23.742
TIMES WHICH PROVIDES. SOME

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:24.909
BUFFER FOR THE COURTS TO CATCH

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:27.012
UP. IN ADDITION THE COURTS WERE

00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:28.847
ABLE THEIR CLIENTS

00:27:28.913 --> 00:27:30.515
RATES PRINT PANDEMIC DUE TO

00:27:30.582 --> 00:27:31.850
THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE REMOTE

00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:34.152
PROCEEDINGS IN MANY AREAS. SO

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:36.554
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE JUVENILE AREA

00:27:36.621 --> 00:27:37.789
WHERE REMOTE PROCEEDINGS ARE

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:38.757
WIDELY USED ARE THE PANDEMIC

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:41.226
CLEARANCE RATES EXCEEDED PRE

00:27:41.292 --> 00:27:43.395
PLANNED ROUTES. OUR GENERAL

00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:44.329
CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT THE

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:45.530
PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN FOCUSED

00:27:45.597 --> 00:27:47.132
AROUND PHYSICAL DISTANCE

00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:48.933
CONSTRAINTS ARE WHICH REDUCE THE

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.002
COURT ROOM CAPACITY. AND

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:53.171
WORKFORCE SHORTAGES SIMILAR TO

00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:54.706
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN OTHER AREAS

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:56.674
BOTH THE PRIVATE AND THE PUBLIC

00:27:56.741 --> 00:27:58.410
SECTOR. SO FOR EXAMPLE CREE

00:27:58.476 --> 00:28:00.378
PANDEMIC VACANCY RATES HOVER

00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:03.548
AROUND 629% AT SEVERAL COURTS

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:05.417
AND DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE

00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:07.986
PANDEMIC. THAT RATE INCREASE.

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:09.287
NINE TO FIFTEEN PERCENT. ARE AND

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:11.256
AS OF THIS MONTH THOSE COURTS

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:12.857
ACTUALLY HAVE A AVERAGE VACANCY

00:28:12.924 --> 00:28:15.794
RATE NOW OF TEN TO SEVENTEEN

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.862
PERCENT. SO WHILE SOME COURTS

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:19.097
EVERITT CURRENTLY THEIR PRE

00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:21.933
PANDEMIC VACANCY RATES ARE MANY

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.902
HAVE NOT. OTHER VACANCY IS DUE

00:28:23.968 --> 00:28:26.004
TO TWO PRIMARY FACTORS BUT THE

00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:27.272
FIRST IS DIFFICULTY IN FILLING

00:28:27.338 --> 00:28:30.108
VACANCIES AND THE SECOND IS IN

00:28:30.175 --> 00:28:33.111
MANAGING COVERT EXPOSURES. ARE

00:28:33.178 --> 00:28:35.013
AGAIN FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE COURT.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.082
A COURT ROOM CLERK JOB POSTING

00:28:37.148 --> 00:28:38.750
WHICH TYPICALLY RESULT IN ABOUT

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:41.519
FIFTY APPLICANTS FREE PANDEMIC.

00:28:41.586 --> 00:28:43.321
BUT NOW ONLY ELEVEN O'CLOCK.

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:45.690
ANOTHER COURT WAS ABLE TO HIRE A

00:28:45.757 --> 00:28:47.859
HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:49.194
IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE FISCAL

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.396
YEAR. BUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:53.932
FOUR PEOPLE LEFT DURING THAT

00:28:53.998 --> 00:28:55.700
SAME PERIOD. BUT DURING THIS

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:57.102
PERIOD WE ALSO SAW THE DELTA

00:28:57.168 --> 00:28:59.437
VARIANT AND A HIGH RATE OF

00:28:59.504 --> 00:29:00.238
COVERT EXPOSURE I WHICH FOR

00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:02.507
STAFF TO ISOLATE OR PRODUCE A

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:04.175
NEGATIVE COVERT TASK. I WHICH

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:06.578
WAS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AT THE

00:29:06.644 --> 00:29:08.513
TIME DUE TO TESTING SHORTAGE.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.115
REGARDING REGARDING THE A

00:29:10.181 --> 00:29:12.183
BACKLOG OF FILINGS BY DATA

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.551
SHOWING THAT BACKLOG THE

00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:15.653
PRIMARIES THE FOCUS. IN THE

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.689
CRIMINAL AREAS WITH THE LARGEST

00:29:17.755 --> 00:29:21.092

IN THE TRAFFIC AND NON TRAFFIC

00:29:23.628 --> 00:29:25.463
MISDEMEANOR CASE. WITH THE

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.332
SMALLER BACK LOG IN UNLIMITED

00:29:27.398 --> 00:29:29.534
CIVIL CASES AND NO BACKLOG IN

00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:33.338
LIVE AT LIMITED CIVIL. ARE THESE

00:29:33.404 --> 00:29:34.772
ARE THE BRANCH RIGHT ESTIMATES

00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:36.841
AND INDIVIDUAL COURT BACKLOGS

00:29:36.908 --> 00:29:40.345
MAY VERY. SO THE COURTS THAT ARE

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:13.945
CHALLENGES. FINALLY FELONIES ONE

00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:15.079
OF THE CASE TYPES WERE FINDING

PANDEMIC- BUT QUICKLY RETURNED

COURTS IN BECAUSE WE HAVE SO

MANY DIFFERENT COURTS. ARE YOU

00:35:37.001 --> 00:35:40.137

00:35:40.204 --> 00:35:42.039
ADDRESS A BACKLOG IN EACH COURT

00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:44.108
OR ARE THERE AREAS THAT STILL

00:35:44.175 --> 00:35:47.011
NEED SOME WORK. EVERY COURT IS

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:50.214
DIFFERENCE AND SO- THE

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:51.382
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING THAT WAS

00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:53.518
PROVIDED TO THE COURT IS HELPFUL

00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:55.586
IN THE AREAS THAT I HAD

00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:56.821
MENTIONED BOTH IN TERMS OF. OUR

00:35:56.888 --> 00:35:59.924
TEMPORARY HELP AND- RENTALS FOR

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:02.326
FACILITIES NOT TECHNIQUE FOR

00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:04.228
USING THE MONEY IN THE SAME WAY

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:05.796
HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF THE

00:36:05.863 --> 00:36:07.932
COURTS ARE USING. THAT MONEY FOR

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:10.768
TEMPORARY HELP- AND SO AGAIN

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:14.071
DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL COURT-

00:36:14.138 --> 00:36:16.674
BUT THE ARE ADDRESSING IT AS

00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:18.976
BEST AS THEY CAN WITH THE

00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:20.478
RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE. SO

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:21.712
WHAT ARE SOME STRATEGIES A

00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:23.514
DIFFERENT COURTS ARE USING THEM

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:25.216
TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG. SO ONE OF

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:26.684
THE STRATEGIES. AS I HAVE

00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:29.086
MENTIONED IS TO USE OUR

00:36:29.153 --> 00:36:31.289
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR A

00:36:31.355 --> 00:36:33.558
TEMPORARY HELP TO AS I MENTIONED

00:36:33.624 --> 00:36:34.892
ONE OF THE BIG DRIVERS IS WHEN

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:39.764
PEOPLE GO OUT. AS A RESULT OF- A

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.800
EXPOSURE OR INFECTION AND SO AS

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.735
THOSE PEOPLE GO OUT ON ONE OF

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:46.237
THE TECHNIQUES TO BRING ON

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:48.973
TEMPORARY PEOPLE TO- HELP WITH

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.043
THAT. THE OTHER EXAMPLE I HAD

00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:54.011
MENTIONED WAS AROUND HOW

00:36:54.078 --> 00:36:56.514
LIMITATIONS IN FACILITIES ARE

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:57.748
AND SO IF THERE'S THE

00:36:57.815 --> 00:37:00.418
OPPORTUNITY FOR EXAMPLE TO HAVE

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:02.420
A RENTAL OF A- EXTERNAL

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:04.822
FACILITY. THAT'S BEING DONE

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:05.890
HOWEVER ESPECIALLY IN THE

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:08.059
CRIMINAL AREA WHERE THERE IS THE

00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:09.594
HIGH DEPENDENCY ON THE

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.096
AVAILABILITY OF JUSTICE PARTNERS

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:16.834
ARE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING. CANNOT

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:19.537
HELP THEIR- OKAY IN ARE YOU TRY.

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:20.137
THOUGH COURT BY. THERE IS THE

00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:23.007
ABILITY TO CLEAR UP THAT THE

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.976
BACKLOG AND THEIR STRATEGY SINCE

00:37:25.042 --> 00:37:26.677
YOU SAY THE ROLE A LITTLE BIT

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:27.878
DIFFERENT IT'S HARD FOR US TO

00:37:27.945 --> 00:37:30.247
UNDERSTAND IS THAT. WHAT WE HEAR

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:32.316
FROM FRATERNITIES ACROSSTHE

00:37:32.383 --> 00:37:37.154
STATE IS VERY DESPERATE AND SO I

00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:38.756
APPRECIATE THAT OVERALL IT LOOKS

00:37:38.823 --> 00:37:40.524
GOOD I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:42.994
HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.062
THERE MIGHT BE CHALLENGES WHICH

00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:46.831
COURTS ARE STRUGGLING WHICH

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:49.200
COURTS ARE DOING THAT. RIGHT SO

00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:51.402
WE DON'T HAVE AT THIS POINT- THE

00:37:51.469 --> 00:37:54.271
DATA AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL I'M

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:56.907
PREPARED FOR YOU. HOWEVER WE DO

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:58.843
WORK WITH EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL

00:37:58.909 --> 00:37:59.977
COURTS AND HAVE RECEIVED

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:01.379
FEEDBACK FROM THEM IN TERMS OF

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:02.713
THE STRATEGIES THAT THEY'RE

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.116
USING- YOU ADDRESS THE BACKLOG

00:38:05.182 --> 00:38:07.318
AND THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE BEST

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:09.887
PRACTITIONERS ACROSS THE COURT.

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:13.791
OKAY GET IT. I GET CONCERNS WHEN

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:15.860
. WE HEAR EXAMPLES SORT OF COURT

00:38:15.926 --> 00:38:17.595
BY COURT AND IT'S A LOT OF

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:18.963
ATTORNEYS PRACTICE IN IN

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.564
MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND WHEN

00:38:20.631 --> 00:38:22.400
THEIR EXPERIENCES ARE DIFFERENT

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:24.268
JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:24.802
THAT BECOMES A LITTLE BIT

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:27.805
CONCERNING AND THEN THE SAME

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:31.575
QUESTIONS ESSENTIALLY ON. THE

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.477
REMOTE ACCESS I'M HEARING THE

00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:35.780
SAME THING THAT REMOTE ACCESS IS

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:38.482
WORKING SUMMERS IN AND NOT IN

00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:40.718
OTHERS WHAT WHAT'S BEING DONE TO

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:42.820
ENSURE THAT RESOURCE ARE BEING

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:44.588
INVESTED WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE SO

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:47.291
THAT WE CAN HAVE AS MUCH

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:48.359
CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE COURTS AS

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:49.527
POSSIBLE HELLO SURE SO TO

00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:50.895
ADDRESS YOUR FIRST POINT ABOUT

00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:53.431
THE INCONSISTENCY AROUND OF THE

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:57.368
WAVE THAT- THE BACKLOGS HAVE

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:59.603
AFFECTED THE INDIVIDUAL COURTS-

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.971
THAT'S REALLY DUE TO THE

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:02.173
PANDEMIC BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC

00:39:02.239 --> 00:39:04.208
HAS AFFECTED EACH INDIVIDUAL

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:06.777
COUNTY IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS SO

00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:07.945
FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME COUNTIES

00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:09.947
WERE SAYING. THERE'S NOT A HUGE

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:12.216
NUMBER OF INFECTIONS AND SO-

00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:14.785
THERE'S EIGHT LOWER BACK WHILE

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:16.387
IN SOME COUNTIES AS THE HIGHEST

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:18.723
LEVEL IN OF INFECTION AND IMPACT

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:20.291
ON THE PANDEMIC AND SAW HIGHER

00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:23.160
IMPACT ON THE BACKLOG AND SO IT

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:25.129
REALLY VARIES BY I CALLED THE

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:28.866
LOCAL- THE LOCAL AREA IMPACTED

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:30.634
WITH REGARDS TO REMOTE

00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:32.303
PROCEEDINGS A REMOTE

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:34.705
PROCEEDINGS- IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT

00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:37.108
ON THE AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY

00:39:37.174 --> 00:39:38.743
INFRASTRUCTURE AT A PARTICULAR

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:42.346
COURT SO THE COURTS HAVE BEEN

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:46.917
PRETTY PROACTIVE. IN INVEST IN

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:50.321
REMOTE. ARE AND THE THREE. SOME

00:39:50.387 --> 00:39:51.889
OF THE END OF FUNDING THAT WAS

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:55.059
PROVIDED COURTS WERE ABLE TO-

00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:57.128
IMPLEMENT REMOTE TECHNOLOGY

00:39:57.194 --> 00:39:59.463
HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.631
COURTHOUSES IN COURT ROOMS THAT

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:02.800
HAVE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND

REALLY BRING UP THE COURTS TO

00:40:09.406 --> 00:40:10.775

ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

00:43:47.858 --> 00:43:49.626
ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE RECOMMEND

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:51.528
THAT THE LEGISLATURE INSURE THAT

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:53.564
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING PROVIDED.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.566
AS WELL AS HOW IT'S ALLOCATED

00:43:55.632 --> 00:43:58.002
REFLECTS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES

00:43:58.068 --> 00:43:59.937
SERVICE THE GOAL OF PROMOTING

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:01.772
FISCAL EQUITY AMONGST THE TRIAL

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:04.208
COURTS IS. IT HAS MERIT THE GOAL

00:44:04.274 --> 00:44:05.976
OF MERIT AS IT PROMOTES EQUAL

00:44:06.043 --> 00:44:07.111
ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACROSS THE

00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:09.079
STATE. HOWEVER IT'S CURRENTLY

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:10.981
UNCLEAR HOW EXACTLY THE MONEY

00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:12.750
WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO ACHIEVE

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:15.119
THAT S. AS ON THAT DECISION IS

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:17.021
GOING TO BE LEFT TO JUDICIAL

00:44:17.087 --> 00:44:19.323
COUNCIL. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.791
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:22.826
PROMOTING FISCAL EQUITY WHICH

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:24.661
CAN IMPACT THE NUMBER OF COURTS

00:44:24.728 --> 00:44:26.597
THAT RECEIVE FUNDING AS WELL AS

00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:28.966
HOW MUCH THEY RECEIVE. SO FOR

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:31.035
EXAMPLE. THE COURTS HAVE A

00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:32.936
WORKLOAD FORMULA AND THAT

00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:34.338
BASICALLY IDENTIFIES THE AMOUNT

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:36.173
OF FUNDING RELATIVE TO WORKLOAD

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.376
THAT- A COURT NEEDS TO KIND OF

00:44:39.443 --> 00:44:40.010
ADDRESS THAT WORKLOAD. AND SO

00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:41.945
THE FUNDING COULD BE TARGETED TO

00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:43.113
THE COURTS BELOW THE STATEWIDE

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.282
AVERAGE AS KIND OF REFERENCED BY

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:46.750
MR WARDLAW AND HIS COMMENTS

00:44:46.817 --> 00:44:48.852
WHICH IS WHAT WE DID IN TWO

00:44:48.919 --> 00:44:49.753
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.522
ACCORDING COULD BE TARGET TO HIT

00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:53.023
THE DESIGNATED FUNDING

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.691
PERCENTAGE SO THAT ALL COURTS

00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:58.062
ARE AT LEAST A CERTAIN

00:44:58.128 --> 00:44:59.129
PERCENTAGE OF MONEY. WE WOULD

00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:00.831
ALSO NOTE THAT OTHER. COULD ALSO

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:03.067
BE CONSIDERED- MOST NOTABLY THE

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:05.235
THINGS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT IN

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:05.903

DELAYS. IN COURT PROCEEDINGS AND

00:45:11.942 --> 00:45:12.876
THIS COULD HELP ADDRESS EQUITY

00:45:12.943 --> 00:45:14.678
IN TERMS OF PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE

00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:16.480
COURTS AND HOW QUICKLY CASES CAN

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:19.016
BE RESOLVED. SO IN LINE WITH

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:20.150
THIS ONE OPTION THE LEGISLATURE

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:22.319
COULD CONSIDER IS TO PROVIDE

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:24.154

ENSURE THAT ALL COURTS HAVE A

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.406

WHY. WANT TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH

00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:06.810

DIFFERENT AREAS BUT- I DO THINK

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:24.628
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A LITTLE

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:27.431

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:43.680
PROPOSED TO BE ADDRESSED AND THE

00:54:43.747 --> 00:54:45.115
SOLVENCY WILL LIKELY REQUIRE

00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:47.150
SIGNIFICANT FUND RESOURCES ON AN

00:54:47.217 --> 00:54:53.456
ONGOING BASIS. TO PAY FOR THE%

00:54:53.523 --> 00:54:55.191
DEBT SERVICE FOR ALREADY

00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:57.327
COMPLETED COURTHOUSES AND SO DO

00:54:57.394 --> 00:54:59.195
IN ORDER TO PERMANENTLY ADDRESS

00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:01.097
THE LONG TERM SOLVENCY OF THIS

00:55:01.164 --> 00:55:02.599
CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNT WE ACTUALLY

00:55:02.666 --> 00:55:03.800
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:05.402
SHIFT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:07.103
TRIAL COURT CONSTRUCTION TO THE

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:09.005
GENERAL FUND BY SHIFTING OFF

00:55:09.072 --> 00:55:10.940
FINANCING OBLIGATIONS OVER TO

00:55:11.007 --> 00:55:13.309
THE GENERAL FUND. APPROPRIATING

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:16.046
GENERAL FUND TO MAINTAIN SUPPORT

00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:16.913
FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.581
CURRENTLY FUNDED- THROUGH THIS

00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:21.084
ACCOUNT AND THEN DEPOSITING ALL

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:21.951
REVENUES THAT WOULD HAVE

00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:23.219
OTHERWISE BEEN DEPOSITED INTO

00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:24.587
THIS ACCOUNT INTO THE GENERAL

00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:26.256
FUND INSTEAD SO THEY'RE STILL

00:55:26.322 --> 00:55:28.124
AVAILABLE TO OFFSET THOSE COSTS

00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:30.226
THAT GOT SHIFTED. AND SO THIS

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:31.961
APPROACH WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL

00:55:32.028 --> 00:55:34.297
CONSTRUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS

00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:35.665
ARE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR AND

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:37.634
CONSIDER WHEN WE'RE EVALUATING

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:38.968
THE STATE'S OVERALL PHYSICAL

00:55:39.035 --> 00:55:41.771

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:42.739
GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES.

00:55:42.806 --> 00:55:44.541
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER FULL

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:46.242
RESPONSIBILITY IS SHIFTED OVER

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:47.811
TO THE GENERAL FUND WE DO

00:55:47.877 --> 00:55:49.045
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:50.880
APPROPRIATE FUNDING FOR FACILITY

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:52.782
RELATED PROJECTS BASED ON ITS

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:54.984
GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES. IF IT

00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:56.553
IS A PRIORITY THE LEGISLATURE

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:58.488
COULD CONSIDER ADDITIONAL ONE

00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:00.123
TIME FUNDING FOR PORT FACILITY

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:02.525

MODIFICATION OR EFERRED

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.562
MAINTENANCE. AS THE JUDICIAL

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:06.596
BRANCH HAS IDENTIFIED

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:08.465
SIGNIFICANT FACILITY NEEDS AND

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:11.101
THIS TYPE OF SPENDING IS

00:56:11.167 --> 00:56:12.736
EXCLUDABLE UNDER SAL. THANK YOU

INCLUDING COURTS SPECIAL FUNDS

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:34.858
THEREFORE ANY WE BELIEVE ANY

00:56:34.924 --> 00:56:35.892
SOLUTION FOR THIS FUND SHOULD BE

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:37.327
CONSIDERED IN A BROADER CONTEXT

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:38.561

THUNDER MADE SOLVENT WITHOUT

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:07.657
REDUCING SERVICE LEVELS IN THE

00:57:07.724 --> 00:57:09.559
BUDGET YEAR WELL WE DEVELOP A

00:57:09.626 --> 00:57:11.127
PERMANENT SOLUTION TO PASS

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:13.096
INSOLVENCY FOR ONLY THIS FUND.

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:14.264
BUT OTHERS INCLUDING THE

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:18.668
IMPROVEMENT. AND MODERNIZATION

00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:20.003

YEARS US THE TWO BILLION

00:57:35.251 --> 00:57:38.321
DOLLARS- THAT THAT WE ARE GOING

00:57:38.388 --> 00:57:42.225
TO BE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH.

00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:44.027
EITHER THE DEPARTMENT THE

JUDICIAL COUNCIL OR THE

00:57:45.962 --> 00:57:47.730
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHY ARE WE

00:57:47.797 --> 00:57:49.499
NOT TRYING TO THINK MORE LONG

00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:51.334
TERM SOLUTION ESPECIALLY SENSE

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:54.504
THESE FUNDS WOULD QUALIFY TO BE

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:59.609
SELL EXCLUDABLE EXPENSES. I JUST

00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:01.711
TO REMIND FINANCED THANK YOU FOR

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:03.746
THE QUESTION I'M IT IS FAR AS

00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:05.148
ALL OF THE EXPENDITURES BEING

00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:06.449
CONSIDERED SALAS GLOBAL I WOULD

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:07.750
HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT

00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:09.719
THAT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:12.255
IS THE CASE- AS FAR AS THAT THE

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:13.356
STATE COURT FACILITIES

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:14.724
CONSTRUCTION FUND IT IS A PLAN

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:17.126
THAT. WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING

00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:19.495
AND LAST YEAR WE GET ACTUALLY

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:20.029
CONSOLIDATED THE TWO CORE

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:21.631
CONSTRUCTION ON TO THE STATE

00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:22.932
CORPORATE SO HE'S CONSTRUCTION

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.133
BUT ANY IMMEDIATE AND CRITICAL

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:27.337
NEEDS ACCOUNT UP TO ALLOW FOR

00:58:27.403 --> 00:58:29.372
SOLVENCY IN THE- A CURRENT YOUR-

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:30.874
CURRENTLY. AND THEN THE BUT

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:34.644
YOU'RE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:36.446
THREE SO I'M MOVING FORWARD WITH

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:39.148
OUR PLAN IS TO DO IS TO SET

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:41.050
ASIDE THE FUNDING FOR THE BUDGET

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:43.086
YEAR AND THEN ONCE WE MOVE

00:58:43.152 --> 00:58:45.021
FORWARD INTO THE FOLLOWING YEAR

00:58:45.088 --> 00:58:47.123
CONSIDER A SOLUTION. THAT COULD

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:49.893
POTENTIALLY BE MOVING OUT OF

00:58:49.959 --> 00:58:50.760
THIS NETWORK FACILITIES

00:58:50.827 --> 00:58:52.562
CONSTRUCTION FUND INTO THE

00:58:52.629 --> 00:58:56.666
GENERAL FUND- IN THE FUTURE- AS

00:58:56.733 --> 00:58:58.534
WE MOVE FORWARD- IN IN THE

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.904
CURRENT YEAR WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:01.804
CONSISTENTLY MONITOR REVENUES

00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:03.206
THAT THIS COULD IMPROVE OUR

00:59:03.273 --> 00:59:04.607
KITCHEN THERE COULD BE LAST.

00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:06.643
REVENUE NEEDED BUT WE WANTED TO

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:09.145
DEFER THIS OPTION SO WE CAN HAVE

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:10.680
A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION UNTIL

00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:16.319
JUST THIS ISSUE POTENTIALLY. IN

00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:18.321
THE FALL. AND YOU. MAY IN YOUR

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:19.656
PURSE IT DEPARTMENT TO FIND YOU

00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:21.291
BRIEFLY MENTIONING YOUR-

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:22.692
PRESENTATION- AS A POSSIBILITY

00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:23.960
CONSIDERING CONVERTING THE

00:59:24.027 --> 00:59:25.428
FUNDING TO THE GENERAL FUND

00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:26.996
WHICH IS WHAT THE L. A- TALKED

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:28.431
ABOUT IS SOMETHING THAT IS

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:31.301
SERIOUSLY BEING CONSIDERED JUST.

00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:32.302
SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING

00:59:32.368 --> 00:59:35.138
AS A POSSIBILITY. I MEAN WORKING

00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:36.940
SINGLE SOLUTIONS ASK NICELY A

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:39.509
POINT OUT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:59:39.575 --> 00:59:42.879
BALANCE THERE- WHICH IT IT IS AN

00:59:42.946 --> 00:59:44.614
OPTION TO ADDRESS THE GENERAL

00:59:44.681 --> 00:59:45.848
FUND IT'S NOT JUST WHO

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:46.883
DEPARTMENTS FINANCE SAYING THAT

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:49.852
IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD.

00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:51.854
HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT FURTHER. IT

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.656
JUST SEEMS THAT GIVE AN IDEA OF

00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:55.658
PRESIDENTE SURPLUS THAT WE HAVE

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:58.161
RIGHT NOW THAT THIS WOULD BE THE

00:59:58.227 --> 01:00:01.030
TIME TO FOCUS ON. NOT JUST

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:01.664
TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:03.132
THREE BUT THE LONG TERM-

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:04.968
PROJECTIONS AND THE SHORTCOMINGS

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:07.537
THAT WEHAVE- VERSUS AT A FUTURE

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:08.871
WITH THAT'S NOT GUARANTEED. TO

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:11.708
BE TO SEE THESE DISPENSED AGAIN.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:14.911
ON INTO FEELS LIKE A MISSED

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:18.214
OPPORTUNITY FOR US. MR STONE.

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:21.184
THANK YOU BATUM CHAIR IT ENDS

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.686
THIS PROPOSAL A LOT OF WAYS JUST

01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:25.355
KINDA KICKED THAT CAN DOWN THE

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:27.824
ROAD AND IF WE JUST. GET THE

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.460
THIS ACCOUNT SOLVENTS FOR NOW

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:32.695
THEN. THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE US

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:34.297
WITH SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS DOWN

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:35.999
THE ROAD I WOULD FRANKLY RATHER

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:38.234
SEE US COME UP WITH A BROADER

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.269
PLAN FOR HOW WE ADDRESS.

01:00:40.336 --> 01:00:42.538
FACILITIES NEEDS NOW AND ON

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:44.640
GOING AND THAT WOULD PUT INTO

01:00:44.707 --> 01:00:47.443
CONTEXT EXACTLY. THE BROADER

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:48.911
PICTURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:50.413
AND REMEMBER THAT WHAT OF THE

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.748
JUDICIAL BRANCH BUDGET EVEN IF

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:53.549
YOU LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS ACTION

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:54.784
ITEM THE CERTAINLY THE NEXT ITEM

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:56.819
IT'S REALLY BUILT ON. FINES AND

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:58.821
FEES IN ORDER TO MAKE ENDS MEET

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:00.990
AND- INSTEAD OF JUST REDUCING

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:02.658
SOME OF THESE FINES AND FEES WE

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:04.560
HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN FOR GETTING

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:05.895
RID OF THESE FINES AND FEES

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:06.763
THEIR INEQUITABLE IT IS THE

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.297
WRONG WAY. TO BUILD THESE

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:10.967
BUDGETS AND AN ACTUAL LIKE THIS

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:12.301
GIVES THE LEGISLATURE THE

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:13.870
OPPORTUNITY TO GET A BETTER

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:15.004
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ALL THE

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:16.839
CONSTRUCTION PROPOSALS ARE SOME

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:19.375
OF THESE HAVE BEEN LANGUISHING

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:21.177
FOR DECADES. AND PRIORITIES THAT

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:22.879
WERE SET DECADES AGO MAY NOT BE

01:01:22.945 --> 01:01:26.082
PRIORITIES NOW SO IF THIS WERE

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:28.818
TO COME IN THE GENERAL FUND

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.653
WHICH I THINK IS A LOT OF ONE

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.821
GOAL. AND A PLAN TO DO THAT

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:34.057
WOULD GIVE US MUCH MORE

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:34.657
VISIBILITY INTO WHAT THEY'RE

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.626
CONSTRUCTION NEEDS ARE. BE ABLE

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:37.994
TO LEVERAGE MORE BROADLY. THE

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:42.598
STATE'S. ABILITY TO LEVERAGE

01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:45.301
FIVE IT'S FINANCES. MANAGE SOME

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:48.871
OF THIS DEBT AND HAVE US I DON'T

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:50.339
KNOW THE SOLUTION SENT SHUDDERS

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:52.008
DOWN THE SPINES OF EVERYBODY

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:52.975
JUDICIAL COUNCIL BUT HAVE THE

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:55.078
LEGISLATURE MORE INVOLVED IN

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:57.814
DECISIONS ABOUT. WHERE COURT

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.515
CONSTRUCTION IS HAPPENING WHERE

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:01.017
THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE DRIVING

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:03.086
SOME OF THESE DCISIONS AS

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:05.288
OPPOSED TO JUST SHORING UP FUNDS

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:06.689
AND GOING WITH SOME SOME

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:12.328
OUTDATED. PRIORITIES SO THIS

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.663
SHIFT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:15.965
COULD REALLY START OUT NOW WE DO

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:18.034
HAVE THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:18.835
MAKE SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:21.037
AND I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE IS

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:23.706
VERY INTERESTED. IN SOLVING. THE

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:25.408
ISSUES MORE BROADLY ABOUT FINES

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.777
AND FEES BUT ALSO GETTING ITS

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:30.746
HANDS ARE. MORE FIRMLY AROUND

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:31.848
WHERE SOME OF THIS MONEY IS

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:33.749
BEING SPENT WHITES BEING SPENT

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:35.284
WHAT SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:36.953
AND CLEARLY UNDERSTANDING WHERE

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:39.489
THE NEED IS SO I THINK THAT

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:40.423
PROPOSAL IS SOMETHING WE

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.024
DEFINITELY SHOULD BE LOOKING AND

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:43.793
WORKING ON AND I WOULD LIKE TO

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.662
SEE. A PATH TOWARDS MOVING TO

01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:48.631
PUT THESE CONSTRUCTION FUNDS

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.600
INTO THE GENERAL FUND SO THAT WE

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:52.635
HAVE MORE DIRECT ACCESS TO BE

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.537
ABLE TO MANAGE THOSE AND HELP

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:57.440

IT'S NOT PAY FOR ANY ADDITIONAL

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:13.789

SOURCES FOR THE CAPITAL PROJECTS

BUT THEY HAVE BEEN PRIORITIZED-

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:59.462
VERY METHODICALLY AND I'M HAPPY

01:04:59.528 --> 01:05:07.303

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:11.207
YOU- I'M KINDA CURIOUS ABOUT OUR

I WAS CHAIR IN TWENTY THIRTEEN

01:05:13.909 --> 01:05:16.379
AND I DO REMEMBER THE THESE

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.881
LISTS AND- I THINK AT THE TIME-

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:20.616
DURING THE REALLY BAD ECONOMIC

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:23.152
TIMES THE LEGISLATURE TOOK QUITE

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:25.354
A BIT OF YOU TOOK A HAIR CUT TO

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:28.958
HELP BALANCE THE BUDGET. IT WAS

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:29.992
A SIGNIFICANT. SIGNIFICANT HAIR

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:34.730
CUT AT ALL IT AT THE TIME- THE

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:37.166
GOVERNOR. BASICALLY HELP BALANCE

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:39.101
THE BUDGET BY USING THIS AND I'M

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:41.904
I'M NOT SURE IF WE EVER. I TRY

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:43.639
TO GET AS MUCH LARGER CHINESE

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:44.940
MUCH MONEY BACK INTO

01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:46.809
CONSTRUCTION FUNDS BUT PART OF

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:50.179
PART OF MY- MY DILEMMA WAS-

01:05:50.246 --> 01:05:53.182
HAVING JUDGES. AND LAWYERS DO

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:56.485
CONSTRUCTION- THAT WHEN I WAS

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:58.654
DIRECTOR OF ASSET MANAGEMENT FOR

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:01.624
THE CITY WHEN YOU HAD- POLICE

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:04.026
AND FIRE AND LIBRARIANS HANDLING

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:06.195
CONSTRUCTION. OF MOST THE TIMES

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:08.431
THEY WERE OVER BUDGET AND THEY

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:10.199
NEVER MET THE TIME LIMIT THAT

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:10.866
THEY GAVE WHEN THEY WOULD

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:12.635
COMPLETE THE PROJECT WHICH WAS

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:15.838
TOTALLY IN AN EFFICIENT AND IN

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:19.408
SOME CASES. MANAGERS HAD. BOB

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:20.843
OFFICERS LARGER THAN COUNCIL

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.346
OFFICES AND MAYOR'S OFFICES- IS

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:25.681
EXTREMELY WASTE OF MONEY BUT

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:27.183
ONCE WE GOT PUBLIC WORKS

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:29.418
ENGINEERING INVOLVED AND PUT. A

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:31.420
PUBLIC FOR ENGINEERS AND PROJECT

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:34.357
MANAGERS INVOLVED WE HAVE TO GET

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:37.626
IT ON. IN IN SOME KIND OF- UNDER

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:39.829
CONTROL AND SO ARE PROJECTS FROM

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:42.331
THAT POINT ON TO WORK ON TIME

01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:46.202
AND ON BUDGET. AND SO MY FIRST

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:47.603
QUESTION IS. I'M LOOKING AT

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.105
THESE NUMBERS. ABOUT THE

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:50.973
APPROVED PROJECT BUDGET BUT IT

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.975
DOESN'T GIVE YOU WHAT THE

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:55.778
ORIGINAL. COSTS IT WAS SO I'M

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.346
CONCERNED ABOUT IN ACOSTA

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:59.882
MATERIALS GOING UP- YEAH YEAH

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:01.951
YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE PLACE A LOT

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:04.820
OF THE BLAME ON REDUCE REVENUES

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:06.756
BUT WHAT ABOUT INCREASE COSTS

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:10.326
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME- WITH-

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:12.561
EMBARGOES WITH. THE FACT THAT WE

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:14.130
CAN'T MOVE GOODS AND SERVICES

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:16.098
OUT OF THE PORT ALL OF THAT HAS

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:18.434
A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ON YOUR

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.103
CONSTRUCTION BOTTOM LINE- AND I

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:22.371
DON'T. IT'S NOT REALLY

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:28.277
REFLECTED. IN THIS- RIGHT NOW- I

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:30.479
GUESS AS PART OF THE- AS PART OF

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.648
YOUR PROBLEM OF HAVING SOMEONE.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.450
HAS BEEN HERE FOR MORE THAN SIX

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.085
YEARS US OWNERS BEEN HERE NOW

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:38.554
FOR TEN YEARS ACTUALLY REMEMBER

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:41.257
WHEN. THESE COSTS WERE A LOT

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:43.025
DIFFERENT AND SO IF THERE'S A

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:44.660
WAY YOU CAN GET TO MY OFFICE

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:46.562
WITH THE ORIGINAL COST WITH THE-

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:47.630
YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE DELTA

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:49.465
BETWEEN WHAT YOU RAISING

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:51.133
DAUGHTERS WOULD COST AND HOW

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.902
ITS- HOUSING GROUND. BUT MOST

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:54.970
IMPORTANT WHAT WAS THAT WAS THE

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:57.907
REASON FOR THAT- BECAUSE AS THE

01:07:57.973 --> 01:08:00.042
MEMBERS ARE HERE ST NOW A WE'RE

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:01.844
LOOKING AT THINGS THAT AT THE

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:05.381
TIME RIGHT NOW. BUT WE MAY GO UP

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:07.183
TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:08.818
YEARS WELL LIKE I COULD PROBABLY

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:13.122
SAFELY SAY MOST PEOPLE HERE ALL

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:14.557
OF US WILL BE GONE. AND WILL

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:16.692
HAVE THE SAME DANCE AGAIN. WHERE

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:17.860
YOU MAY BE ASKING FOR FOUR

01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:19.528
BILLION DOLLARS BUT THE PEOPLE

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.697
WHO ARE. WON'T BE HERE AND

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:23.632
NOBODY ASKING FOR MORE MONEY AND

01:08:23.699 --> 01:08:26.235
THIS JUST SEEMS TO KEEP GOING ON

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:28.003
AND ON AND ON. LUCKILY MOST OF

01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:31.240
THE STATE'S. OR WHEN MOST OF US

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:36.378
. TERM OUT SEPT YOU GOT SOME-

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:36.979
TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TWENTY

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:38.314
EIGHT. BUT EVEN THEN IT TWENTY

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.316
FOUR YOU COULD COME BACK AND SAY

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:41.484
WE NEED ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:45.020
FIVE YEARS AND SO I'M NOT. ONE

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:47.089
OF THEM MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:49.425
THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE WAS THAT

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:50.960
YOU'RE STILL WITHIN THAT AND IF

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:52.828
YOU'RE NOT WHETHER THOSE REASONS

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:55.064
SO WE CAN PLAN TEN YEARS FROM

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:56.465
NOW TO- FOR ANY THING THAT COULD

01:08:56.532 --> 01:09:00.202
COME UP. AND INTO- I'M- I THINK

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:05.374
WE SHOULD BRING IT IN. AND THAT

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:07.209
CAPACITY FOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:09.512
HANDLE THIS AND GET SOME ACTUAL

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.580
CONSTRUCTION PROFESSIONALS. TO

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:13.782
BE ON TOP OF THIS- WE HIRE ALL

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:16.151
PROJECT MANAGERS. ALMOST LIKE

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:17.920
INSPECTOR GENERAL TO OVERSEE

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.588
THESE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT

01:09:19.655 --> 01:09:21.790
SHOULD HE COME IN ON TIME AND ON

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:23.359
BUDGET AND GIVE THE LEGISLATURE

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:25.895
SOME COMFORT. THAT THESE THAT

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:27.730
THESE PROJECTS ARE BEING DONE

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:29.231
ACCORDING TO OUR SPECIFICATIONS

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:31.433
OF WHAT WE ARE ALLOCATING THE

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.302
MONEY FOR AND THAT WEEK THAT THE

01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:35.170
MONIES ARE SPENT APPROPRIATELY.

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:37.773
SO I WROTE THAT COULD BE THAT

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.743
COULD BE DONE. I'M CERTAINLY

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:42.845
THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT ABOUT-

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:46.515
CONSTRUCTION ESCALATION AS- THE-

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.183
CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION INC

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:49.752
INDEX HAS BEEN RUNNING UITE

01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:51.220
RAMPANT THE LAST YEAR OR TWO

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:53.355
IT'S UP OVER FIFTEEN PERCENT-

01:09:53.422 --> 01:09:56.225

THIS IS A TOOL THAT IS ACTUALLY

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:10.492
INFLUENCING BEHAVIOR. THEY'RE

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:11.727

BUT THIS PACKAGE STILL LEAVES

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:42.691
ROOM FOR WIDE DISCRETION AND

01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:44.359
TURN BIAS PARTICULARLY WHEN WE

THEIR FINES I THOUGHT I'D ALSO

01:19:03.638 --> 01:19:05.273
LIKE TO ADD THAT THE SIMPLE

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.675
ASSESSMENT IS USED AS A TOOL

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:08.076
INSTEAD OF MORE INTRUSIVE

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:08.743
ACTIONS SUCH AS THE ISSUANCE OF

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:09.978
BENCH WARRANTS WHICH-

01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:11.379
DENATURATION PRACTICALLY DOESN'T

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:13.014
WANT TO REVERT BACK TO. IN

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:14.816
ADDITION I ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:16.318
WE HAVE THE DESTRUCTION HAS

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:16.918
CONSIDERED THE OTHER

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:19.754
ALTERNATIVES- REFERENCE BY MR

01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:22.157
BUSH SPOKE ABOUT THE UNUSUAL TO

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:25.060
BUY EXTENSION AS WELL AS- USING

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:26.561
OTHER FORMS OF WAGE GARNISHMENT

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:28.830
BANK LEVEES YOU KNOW AS WE AS WE

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:30.699
CONSIDERED- GOING WITH THE

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:32.367
APPROACH OF PROBABLY EXTENSION.

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:34.302
WHICH WAS AT THAT PARTY CAN BE

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:36.171
USED BY TRIAL COURTS BUT WE JUST

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:37.806
HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS COULD

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:39.341
RESULT IN ACCESS TO JUSTICE

01:19:39.407 --> 01:19:40.909
ISSUES BECAUSE REPUBLICANS WHO

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:43.378
ARE NON RESPONSIVE WOULD BE

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.280
FOUND GUILTY WITHOUT FORMAL DEAL

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:46.414
JUDICIAL REVIEW. IN THE

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:48.950
DEFENDERS KNOWLEDGE- IT IS FIRST

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:50.719
THE OTHER POTENTIAL TO NEED TO

01:19:50.785 --> 01:19:52.320
BE LOOKING TO I THINK WAGE

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:55.223
GARNISHMENT BANK LEVEES- WE

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:56.591
BELIEVE THAT YOU IN GENERAL

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:57.959
DRAFTING INDIVIDUALS COUNT CAN

01:19:58.026 --> 01:20:00.462
RESULT OVER DRAFT NECESSITY FEES

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:02.364
WHICH COULD RESULT IN SOME CASES

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:04.332
EQUAL OR EVEN EXCEED MISSILE

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:05.200
ASSESSMENT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:07.235
BE IMPOSED. WE SHOULD ALSO POINT

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:08.603
OUT THAT THIS IS ALREADY AN

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:10.138
OPTION FOR EXCUSE BUT THIS IS

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:12.207
ONLY FOR ONE INDIVIDUALS HAVE

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:13.575
FINANCIAL PENALTIES IF WE

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.177
ELIMINATED THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:17.045
WHICH GARNISHMENT BANK LEVIES

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:17.846
CANNOT BE USED BECAUSE THERE

01:20:17.913 --> 01:20:26.087
WOULD BE NOT. BE A FINANCIAL

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:28.823
PENALTY O COLLECT ON. SO KEEP

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:30.258
HE DIDN'T ANSWER MY THERE IS HOW

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:31.927
THE FACT THAT THE HAVE POINT

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:34.296
WITH VERY AND THAT GONNA SAY.

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:36.765
HELP LOW INCOME CAN OF I WOULD

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:40.001
SAY THAT- HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:42.337
IS STILL TOO MUCH FOR MANY OF

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:44.239
THESE INDIVIDUALS AND SO WE ARE

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:46.374
BALANCING BUDGETS ON THE BACKS

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:48.076
OF OUR LOWEST INCOME COMMUNITY

01:20:48.143 --> 01:20:50.011
MEMBERS THAT WE KNOW ARE

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:52.347
DISPROPORTIONATELY TARGETED- BYE

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:55.217
BYE SYSTEM INSISTS AS WE ENTER

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:56.184
TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH EQUITY AT

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:58.086
THE FOREFRONT OF ALL THE THINGS

01:20:58.153 --> 01:20:59.721
WE DO IT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY WE

01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:01.122
ARE SAYING HALF WAYVERSUS JUST

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:02.557
ELIMINATED IT COMPLETELY AND

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:04.859
FINDING A BETTER WAY TO HAVE A

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:06.828
STABLE RESOURCES FOR OUR PORTS

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:08.597
ARE AND HE FOCUSED A LOT OF

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:10.732
ALTERNATIVES BUT- I WILL SAY

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:12.033
THAT ONE OF OUR PANELISTS ARE

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.402
ENOUGH WITH THE SOMETHING THAT

01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:15.003
WAS REALLY SIMPLE AND A TEXT

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:17.505
MESSAGE. I TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT

01:21:17.572 --> 01:21:20.809
THERE'S NOTHING THAT WE NEED TO.

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:23.945
GO TO A- YOU. NEED TO BE- TO- TO

01:21:24.012 --> 01:21:27.148
WOREDA THIS AND SO. CAN WE GO

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:28.917
BACK TO MY INITIAL QUESTION HOW

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:31.386
DID YOU COME UP WITH A HUNDRED

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:32.420
FIFTY DOLLARS BEING FAIR AND

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:36.391
REASONABLE. AND WE WANTED TO

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:38.426
PROVIDE FINANCIAL RELIEF- Q.

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:39.928
INDIVIDUALS TO RALLY IN WE HAD

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:42.964
SETTLED ON A 50% REDUCTION FOR

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:44.899
THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT ON. ALSO

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:45.834
WENT WHEN WE'RE WHEN WE'RE

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:47.402
TALKING ABOUT REDUCTIONS IN THE

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:48.670
CIVIL ASSESSMENT IS ALSO A

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:49.871
FACTOR ALONGSIDE BROADER

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:51.806
PROGRAMS OUT ONLINE ABILITY TO

01:21:51.873 --> 01:21:54.309
PAY EXPANSION- THROUGH USE OF

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:56.311
THE TOOL IN THE FUTURE- WHEN

01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:58.179
INDIVIDUALS APPLY FOR ONLINE

01:21:58.246 --> 01:22:00.382
ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION IT

01:22:00.448 --> 01:22:01.850
WILL CONSTITUTE AN APPEARANCE

01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:03.785
BOOK WHICH WILL RESTRICT WHICH

01:22:03.852 --> 01:22:06.921
WILL FURTHER REDUCE THE NEED FOR

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:09.257
SIMPLE SYSTEM TO BE ISSUED. IF

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:11.493
I'M STRUGGLING FOR SIMPLE THINGS

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:15.430
LIKE. PUTTING GAS IN MY CAR

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:18.033
WHICH IS LESS THAN A HUNDRED

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:19.601
FIFTY DOLLARS I DON'T SEE HOW

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:21.569
50% OF REALLY GIVES A

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:23.905
INDIVIDUALS THAT BELIEVE THAT

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:26.608
THAT YOU ARE. THEY ARE WISHING

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:28.443
TO DO AND SERVE RELIEF IS OUR

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:30.945
GOAL WHY ARE WE NOT WORKING TO

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:32.647
ELIMINATE THIS FEEL TOGETHER AND

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:33.815
COME UP WITH THE MORE STABLE

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:44.759
SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR OUR COURTS. IT'S- YES SIR I THINK YOU CAN

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:46.561
QUESTION I JUST GETTING BACK TO

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:48.596
LOOK TO MY INITIAL COMMENTS IT'S

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:50.065
NOT JUST ABOUT BEING A REVENUE

01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:52.100
SOURCE IT'S ABOUT HAVING HAVING

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:54.035
SOMETHING THERE WHEN INDIVIDUAL

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:56.071
FAILS TO APPEAR OR FAILS TO PAY

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:57.706
THEIR FINES AS I HAD MENTIONED

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:59.908
WITH THE IF WE POTENTIALLY

01:22:59.974 --> 01:23:01.509
REMOVE THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT FEE

01:23:01.576 --> 01:23:03.511
THERE ARE MORE INTRUSIVE ACTIONS

01:23:03.578 --> 01:23:05.680
THAT COULD BE TAKE THAT COULD

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:07.515
TAKE PLACE. SUCH AS THE ISSUE

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:08.883
WITH THE BENCH WARRANTS FOR ONE

01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:10.385
INDIVIDUALS AREN'T HEARING

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:12.587
SUPPORT THAT IS IT BUT FRANKLIN

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.789
ACTION WE DO NOT WANT TO OCCUR

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:16.224
AND WE BELIEVE THE CIVIL

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:17.058
ASSESSMENT TO BE LESS INTRUSIVE

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:19.361
THAN THE ISSUE THE TOPIC WENT ST

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:21.229
JUST A REVENUE ISSUE IT'S ALSO A

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:23.398
STRUCTURAL ISSUE OF WHICH REFORM

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:25.867
CHANGE TO TAKE PLACE- THE

01:23:25.934 --> 01:23:27.502
ADMINISTRATION IS OPEN TO

01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:30.004
LISTENING TO ALTERNATIVES THAT

01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:31.539
THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO BRING UP

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:34.109
I'M ALSO THERE THERE IS WORK

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:36.378
BEING DONE IN A TEXT REMINDER

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:38.346
SPHERE. BUT THAT DOESN'T GET OUT

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:41.816
THE INHERENT ISSUE OF- AREN'T

01:23:41.883 --> 01:23:42.984
COMPELLING INDIVIDUALS INTO

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:45.053
COURT LIKE THE TAX IS NOT GOING

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.855
TO NECESSARILY REQUIRED THE

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:55.296
INDIVIDUALS. TO SHOW UP TO COURT

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:55.997
ITSELF. IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THIS

01:23:56.064 --> 01:23:57.532
IS COMPELLED TO FEED SOMETHING

01:23:57.599 --> 01:23:58.566
COMPELLED THE VIGILS AND I WILL

01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:00.735
CALL YOUR TRAIN OF THOUGHT

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:04.105
TELLING ME IS ACCURATE THEN WHY

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:04.639
HAVE WE ELIMINATED OTHER

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:07.108
ADMINISTRATIVE CRIMINAL FEES-

01:24:07.175 --> 01:24:09.677
AND MOVE FORWARD WITH WITH THAT

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:10.812
. CHECK THANK YOU FOR THE

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:13.381
QUESTION AGAIN I WOULD MAKE SURE

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:13.882
SHE DOES APPRECIATE THE

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:15.383
CONVERSATION ON THIS ISSUE I

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:16.418
WOULD JUST SAY THAT THOSE FEES

01:24:16.484 --> 01:24:19.287
ARE CHARGED BY. LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:21.356
AND STATE GOVERNMENT THIS FEET

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:24.125
SPECIFICALLY CHARGED BY PORTS

01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:26.494
FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF WHEN

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:30.198
IT WILL APPEAR OR FAILS TO PAY

01:24:30.265 --> 01:24:32.534
OFF. ON IT UNDERSTANDABLY IS

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.035
MISS MISS CAMPUS OF BILLY HAS

01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:36.571
POINTED OUT THAT THESE FEES DO

01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:38.406
YOU HAVE MORE OF AN IMPACT ON

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:40.008
LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND THAT

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:41.443
THAT'S WHY WE'RE ONE OF THE

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:42.877
REASONS WE'RE TRYING TO. LOWER

01:24:42.944 --> 01:24:46.948
THE FEE- HERE SPECIFICALLY- BUT

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:48.583
BIG BECAUSE HOW THIS FEAT IT IS

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:50.018
DRIVEN ENGINEERS TO COMPEL

01:24:50.084 --> 01:24:52.020
INDIVIDUALS TO COME INTO COURT

01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:53.822
WE FIND IT POSSIBLE SAYS AND IT

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:55.223
CAN BE LESS INTRUSIVE. THAN

01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:57.459
ALTERNATIVES THAT COULD BE

01:24:57.525 --> 01:24:59.761
RELIED UPON IF WE GOT RID OF IT.

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:01.496
IF THIS WAS HAS BEEN WE'RE

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:03.531
ELIMINATED THERE COULD BE AND I

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:06.000
I'M NOT SURE HOW TRUMP WORKS. ON

01:25:06.067 --> 01:25:07.502
THERE IS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:09.604
THEY COULD ISSUE BENCH WARRANTS

01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:13.208
TO COMPEL INDIVIDUALS TO GO TO

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:21.182
WANT TO GO. OUT BEFORE. YEAH SO

01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:22.417
IT'S MY- THOUGH THE- WE WERE

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:24.752
NOT. A LOT THESE HE SAID SO IT'S

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:25.954
NOT COME IN THE- TO PAY LEVELS

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.689
THE GOAL THIS TO BE A THAT IS

01:25:27.755 --> 01:25:29.924
THE WORKING AND NEED TO FIGURE

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:31.726
SOMETHING TO. SO I WILL SAY THAT

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.394
MAYBE FOR SOME OF US WHO WERE.

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:35.430
IN THE- ADMINISTRATION ARE HERE

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:36.865
HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS THINGS

01:25:36.931 --> 01:25:38.199
MORE PALATABLE THAN THREE

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:39.367
HUNDRED DOLLARS. BUT WHEN YOU'RE

01:25:39.434 --> 01:25:41.169
STRUGGLING TO LIVING OFF OF FIVE

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:42.637
TEN DOLLARS TODAY A HUNDRED AND

01:25:42.704 --> 01:25:45.740
FIFTY DOLLARS SAYS THE SCREEN

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:46.941
JUST AS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE

01:25:47.008 --> 01:25:49.043
OUT. OUT THERE AND SO I DO HOPE

01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:51.713
THAT WE FIND A WAY TO BOTH-

01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:53.581
ELIMINATED HE'S COMPLETELY FIND

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:55.450
BETTER WAYS TO INCENTIVIZE

01:25:55.517 --> 01:25:56.851
INDIVIDUALS SHOW UP. AND THEN

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:59.053
ALSO FIND SOME STABILITY FOR THE

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.455
FOR THE REVENUE FOR THE COURTS

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:02.590
WHICH THEY THINK SOMETHING. THAT

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:03.525
THEY WOULD APPRECIATE GIVEN OUR

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:05.193
LAST DISCUSSION- I'M GONNA GO

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:08.830

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:14.969
EIGHTH THAT'S RIGHT AGREE WITH

UNPROVEN AND HAVE SUCH A

01:26:20.275 --> 01:26:22.443
DISPARATE IMPACT THAT. THIS IS

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:24.312
THE TIME WE COULD BE TAKING

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:27.015
BOLDER STEPS TO REALLY ENSURE

01:26:27.081 --> 01:26:29.317
THAT WE ARE PROVIDING JUSTICE IN

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:30.585
AN APPROPRIATE MANNER ACROSS THE

01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:33.855
BOARD. SO THE I THINK IT IS TIME

01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:36.925
TO ELIMINATE THE CITY'S. YEAH

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:03.704
THE STAFF LEVEL THAT ALSO

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:05.105
INCREASE THE- DURING THE SAME

01:39:05.172 --> 01:39:06.774
TIME CREATED. I'M GROWING BY

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.677
ABOUT 66% ON THE BOTTOM PROPOSED

01:39:09.743 --> 01:39:11.478
BUDGET WOULD FURTHER INCREASE

01:39:11.545 --> 01:39:13.647
BASED FUNDING AND STAFFING FOR-

01:39:13.714 --> 01:39:15.549
YES. I WE THINK THAT IT'S

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:16.617
REASONABLE TO CONSIDER

01:39:16.684 --> 01:39:18.485
INCREASING THE STATE'S EMERGENCY

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:21.188
RESPONSE CAPACITY ANALYTE AT THE

01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:22.790
HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF EMERGENCIES

01:39:22.856 --> 01:39:23.924
THE STATE HAS SEEN IN RECENT

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:25.826
YEARS. I'M AND THE POSSIBILITY

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:27.027
THAT THIS HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:28.796
EMERGENCIES CONTINUES INTO THE

01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:31.298
FUTURE I'M HOWEVER WE FIND THE

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:33.467
L. YES MAY NOT BE DOING SO IN

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:35.569
THE MOST STRATEGIC MANNER. FIRST

01:39:35.636 --> 01:39:37.338
EVERY ASPECT THE STOCKING PLAN

01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:38.706
AND SO THE DEPARTMENT STAFFING

01:39:38.772 --> 01:39:40.474
NEEDS IN THE NEAR TERM AND

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:42.676
LONGER TERM AND CLEAR. THE

01:39:42.743 --> 01:39:44.278
ABSENCE OF CLEARLY IDENTIFIED

01:39:44.345 --> 01:39:46.013
STAFFING NEEDS I'VE BEEN IN THE

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.048
DEPARTMENT REQUESTING POSITIONS

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:50.217
FOR SIMILAR FUNCTIONS EACH YEAR.

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:52.453
I'M FOR EXAMPLE THAT APARTMENT

01:39:52.519 --> 01:39:54.321
HI I'M HAS REQUESTED POSITIONS

01:39:54.388 --> 01:39:56.256
FIGHTING OVER TIME FOR ITS

01:39:56.323 --> 01:39:58.392
EMPLOYEES AND NEEDING MORE STAFF

01:39:58.459 --> 01:40:01.028
AND THEN. AND THEN THEN THE NEXT

01:40:01.095 --> 01:40:02.696
YEAR YOU'RE AFTER REQUESTING

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:04.665
OPPOSITION FOR AT THE SAME

01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:06.200
RESOURCE FOR THIS AFTER THIS

01:40:06.266 --> 01:40:07.701
WITH THE SAME RATIONALE THIRTY

01:40:07.768 --> 01:40:09.370
INDICATING THAT PRIOR REQUEST

01:40:09.436 --> 01:40:11.572
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN. SUFFICIENT TO

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:13.607
ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS. HI WHICH

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:15.042
RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:17.511
CURRENT REQUESTS. I'M A FURTHER

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:19.780
WE FIND THE- YES IS PROPOSALS

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:21.782
ARE NOT TIED TO ANY SPECIFIC

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:23.817
EMERGENCY RESPONSABLES OR

01:40:23.884 --> 01:40:24.952
OBJECTIVES WHICH MAKES IT

01:40:25.018 --> 01:40:26.186
DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE

01:40:26.253 --> 01:40:27.287
EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE

01:40:27.354 --> 01:40:29.356
PROPOSALS. AND THE EXTENT TO

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:30.858
WHICH THEY WILL ENHANCE THE

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:31.925
STATE'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE

01:40:31.992 --> 01:40:34.728
CAPACITY ARE WE WOULDN'T KNOW

01:40:34.795 --> 01:40:36.397
THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED

01:40:36.463 --> 01:40:38.565
YES I IN CONJUNCTION WITH CAL

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:41.068
FIRE TO. CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT

AT THE STATE'S ON WILDFIRE

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:44.805
RESPONSE CAPACITY AND

01:40:44.872 --> 01:40:46.673
ESTABLISHES GOALS AND IDENTIFY

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:48.709
GAPS AND WEAKNESSES AS PART OF

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:49.910
THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:59.920
BUDGET AND BACKGROUND ASSESSMENT. WAS NEVER COMPLETED. SO IN OF

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:02.222
THE I'M RECOMMENDED WOULD A

01:41:02.289 --> 01:41:03.590
ORDER TO ENSURE THE STATE IS

01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:04.858
PREPARED TO ADDRESS. ONGOING

INCREASES IN NUMBER. IN AN

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:07.327
EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE MANNER

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:08.295
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:09.696
LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:11.698

STRATEGIC PLAN FOR ENHANCING ITS

01:41:14.168 --> 01:41:16.303

TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. OUR WE

01:41:21.809 --> 01:41:23.310
RECOMMEND THAT THE PLAN INCLUDES

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:25.579
FOUR COMPONENTS AND ASSESSMENT

01:41:25.646 --> 01:41:27.481
AT THE EXISTING CAPACITY. I CAN

01:41:27.548 --> 01:41:28.916
I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE SPECIFIC

CAPABILITIES. I WEAKNESS AND

01:41:35.823 --> 01:41:37.825
GAPS THE STATE'S CURRENT ABILITY

01:41:37.891 --> 01:41:38.592
TO MEET THOSE GOALS AND

01:41:38.659 --> 01:41:40.894
OBJECTIVES. AND STAFFING NEEDS

OUTLINING STAFFING- THAT'S

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:48.235
CORRECT THE STAFFING PLAN

01:41:48.302 --> 01:41:50.671
COMPONENT. SUCH A STRATEGIC PLAN

01:41:50.737 --> 01:41:52.206
WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE

EXISTING LBS CAPACITY IS

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:57.144
INSUFFICIENT AND WHETHER THE

01:41:57.211 --> 01:41:58.479
ADMINISTRATION SCHOOLS AND A

01:41:58.545 --> 01:42:00.447
CRAZY AND PRIORITIES ALIGN WITH

THE LEGISLATURE SYMBOLS I'M

01:42:02.483 --> 01:42:07.588

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:21.735
IDEALLY L. YES WOULD HAVE THE

01:42:21.802 --> 01:42:23.770
ABILITY TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC

01:42:23.837 --> 01:42:25.439
PLAN THAT WE RECOMMEND

01:42:25.506 --> 01:42:26.740

CURRENT CAPABILITIES AS WE

01:42:30.544 --> 01:42:31.712
RECOMMEND IN THE PLAN OUR

01:42:31.778 --> 01:42:34.047

TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET

01:42:48.028 --> 01:42:49.463

TAKES OUR RECOMMENDATION. THIS

01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:04.044
WOULD ALSO PROVIDE- YES THE

01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:05.479
OPPORTUNITY TO INDICATE WHAT

01:43:05.546 --> 01:43:08.348
RESOURCES IT MIGHT NEED TO

01:43:08.415 --> 01:43:09.049
DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:11.184
RECOMMEND. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

01:43:11.251 --> 01:43:12.219
**** UNABLE TO COMMIT TO%

01:43:12.286 --> 01:43:13.420
DEVELOPING A PLAN THE

01:43:13.487 --> 01:43:15.556
LEGISLATURE COULD ASK- YES TO

01:43:15.622 --> 01:43:17.024
RECOMMEND ALTERNATIVE ENTITIES

01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:19.626
THAT WOULD BE BETTER SUITED TO

01:43:19.693 --> 01:43:21.962
DEVELOP A PLAN. IN TERMS OF OUR

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:23.363
OVER ARCHING RECOMMENDATIONS WE

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:24.164
ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:43:24.231 --> 01:43:25.899
LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THAT THE

HELL YES BASED BUDGET BE

01:43:27.434 --> 01:43:29.369
REPEALED AFTER THE COMPLETION OF

01:43:29.436 --> 01:43:30.270
THE STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE

01:43:30.337 --> 01:43:32.306
RECOMMEND. SUCH A REVIEW WOULD

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:33.907
DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH

EXISTING RESOURCES ARE MEETING

01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:37.344
THE GOALS IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN.

01:43:37.411 --> 01:43:39.046
WHETHER SOME RESOURCES SHOULD BE

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:40.747
RE ALLOCATED TO HIGHER PARTY

01:43:40.814 --> 01:43:42.950

01:43:48.121 --> 01:43:49.222
REVIEW COUPLED WITH THE

01:43:49.289 --> 01:43:50.524
STRATEGIC PLAN WOULD ALLOW THE

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:52.159
LEGISLATURE THE INFORMATION HE

01:43:52.225 --> 01:43:53.994
NEEDS TO DETERMINE HOW TO

01:43:54.061 --> 01:43:55.329
ALLOCATE FUNDS. TO ENHANCE THE

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:56.563
STATE'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE

01:43:56.630 --> 01:44:00.534
CAPACITY IN THE MOST EFFICIENT

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:01.668

01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:03.036
YEARS. NOW IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC

BUDGET ARE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:10.410
WHAT THE CURRENT LACK OF ITS

01:44:10.477 --> 01:44:11.979
STRATEGIC PLANNING FOR HOW TO

01:44:12.045 --> 01:44:13.714
ENHANCE THE STATE'S EMERGENCY

RESPONSE CAPACITY. FOR THESE

01:44:15.782 --> 01:44:18.018
PROPOSALS WE RECOMMEND PROVIDING

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:19.886
THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM FUNDING.

01:44:19.953 --> 01:44:21.555
THIS RECOMMENDATION WOULD APPLY

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:23.123
TO THE SUPPORT CAPACITY AND

01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:24.625
LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS

ITEMS LATER IN THE AGENDA. UNDER

01:44:29.696 --> 01:44:30.664
THIS APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE

01:44:30.731 --> 01:44:31.632
WOULD PROVIDE THE REQUESTED

01:44:31.698 --> 01:44:33.567
FUNDING IN RECOGNITION THAT- YES

01:44:33.634 --> 01:44:35.268
MIGHT NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

01:44:35.335 --> 01:44:37.070
TO FURTHER ENHANCE THESTATE'S

01:44:37.137 --> 01:44:38.872
EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPABILITIES.

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:39.940
BUT THIS WOULD ALLOW THESE

01:44:40.007 --> 01:44:41.908
AUGMENTATIONS TO BE REVISITED

01:44:41.975 --> 01:44:43.243

THE PROPOSED SPENDING IS

01:44:53.754 --> 01:44:55.322
INTENDED TO PROVIDE FUNDING

01:44:55.389 --> 01:44:57.624
FLEXIBILITY BUT APPEARS TO HAVE

01:44:57.691 --> 01:44:59.693
A SIMILAR STORY INCLUDED IN THE

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.762

01:45:01.828 --> 01:45:03.664
FORTY EIGHT AM. WHICH ALLOW THE

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:11.972
CIRCUMSTANCES. WE UNDERSTAND

01:45:12.039 --> 01:45:12.606
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS

01:45:12.673 --> 01:45:13.940
TO USE THIS FUNDING TO ADDRESS

01:45:14.007 --> 01:45:15.642
WHAT IT BELIEVES IS A GAP IN

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:16.843

FORTY EIGHT AM THAT WE VIEW AS

01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:24.785
AN ALTERNATIVE MIGHT NOT BE

01:45:24.851 --> 01:45:26.853
AVAILABLE. WELL IT'S POSSIBLE

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:28.155
THERE COULD BE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:45:28.221 --> 01:45:29.690
WHEN THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY ITEM

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:36.229
TO IDENTIFY THE EXTENT TO WHICH

01:45:36.296 --> 01:45:38.365
THIS PROBLEM EXISTS OR THE SIZE

LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT BY NOT

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:48.742
REQUIRING NOTIFICATION AT THE

01:45:48.809 --> 01:45:50.711
USE OF FUNDS. I WOULD ONLY

01:45:50.777 --> 01:45:52.713
REQUIRE A ONE TIME REPORT IN

01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:54.715
MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR.

01:45:54.781 --> 01:45:55.248
ACCORDINGLY WE RECOMMEND

01:45:55.315 --> 01:45:57.918

01:45:57.984 --> 01:46:04.991
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

I'M SURE WOULD YOU- LIKE GAP

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:08.161
FROM THE FINANCE TO- THE

01:46:08.228 --> 01:46:10.964
COMMENTS BEFORE QUESTIONS ARE

01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:11.898
DIRECTED ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS

01:46:11.965 --> 01:46:13.200
FIRST. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO

01:46:13.266 --> 01:46:15.902
ADD. I JUST A FEW THINGS I WAS

01:46:15.969 --> 01:46:18.105
JUST GOING TO ADD THAT WHILE WE

01:46:18.171 --> 01:46:19.906
RECOGNIZE THE GROWTH IN- YES IS

01:46:19.973 --> 01:46:20.707
BUDGET BUT DIFFICULT OVER THE

01:46:20.774 --> 01:46:22.409
LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WHILE

01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:24.177
MANY OF THOSE AUGMENTATIONS

01:46:24.244 --> 01:46:25.879
APPEAR TO BE KIND OF DUPLICATIVE

01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:27.881
IN NATURE GIVEN THE TYPES OF

01:46:27.948 --> 01:46:29.549
CLASSIFICATIONS THAT WERE ADDED-

01:46:29.616 --> 01:46:30.817
THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:46:30.884 --> 01:46:32.819
AUTHORIZED TO. INTERPRET PRIOR

01:46:32.886 --> 01:46:34.621
YEARS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN VERY

01:46:34.688 --> 01:46:37.290
TARGETED IN TERMS OF THE TYPES

01:46:37.357 --> 01:46:39.960
OF- DIRECTORATES ARE AREAS

01:46:40.026 --> 01:46:41.328
WITHIN ONLY ADDS. BETTER BEING

01:46:41.394 --> 01:46:43.463
ENHANCED. SO FOR EXAMPLE LAST

01:46:43.530 --> 01:46:45.031
YEAR THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:46:45.098 --> 01:46:46.800
RESOURCES THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE

01:46:46.867 --> 01:46:48.835
FOR LOGISTICS OR OTHER TYPES OF

01:46:48.902 --> 01:46:49.436
DIRECTORATE WE TALKING ABOUT

01:46:49.503 --> 01:46:50.837
HERE. BUT THAT WAS REALLY

01:46:50.904 --> 01:46:53.206
TARGETED AT READING A STUDY

01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:55.342
STATE STREET OPERATIONS CENTER

01:46:55.408 --> 01:46:58.445
BASED STAFFING- BECAUSE-

01:46:58.512 --> 01:47:00.347
PREVIOUSLY THE STATE OPERATIONS

01:47:00.413 --> 01:47:02.215
CENTER ALWAYS REDIRECTED FROM.

01:47:02.282 --> 01:47:04.050
HE ADDED DIRECTORATES TO SUPPORT

01:47:04.117 --> 01:47:07.087
ITSELF AND GIVEN THE ONGOING.

01:47:07.154 --> 01:47:08.488
AND FREQUENT USE OF THE STATE

01:47:08.555 --> 01:47:10.056
OPERATIONS CENTER. IS A

01:47:10.123 --> 01:47:11.591
RECOGNIZED NEED TO CREATE MORE

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:13.160
BAY STAFFING THERE SO WELL THOSE

01:47:13.226 --> 01:47:15.629
APPEAR TO BE SIMILAR. RESOURCES

01:47:15.695 --> 01:47:16.530
BECAUSE OF THE TYPES OF

01:47:16.596 --> 01:47:17.464
CLASSIFICATIONS THAT THEY

01:47:17.531 --> 01:47:19.432
ADDRESSED. THE FOCUS AND PURPOSE

01:47:19.499 --> 01:47:20.834
IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN.

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:22.736
ENHANCING JUST THE BASED STUDY

01:47:22.803 --> 01:47:24.571

THE FRAME NINETEEN HUNDRED IS

01:47:33.013 --> 01:47:34.848

RESPONSE AND THAT IT IS CRAFTED

01:47:36.917 --> 01:47:38.819

02:05:19.778 --> 02:05:21.780
CENTER THE NEEDS TO GO TO A NINE

02:05:21.847 --> 02:05:24.416
EIGHT EIGHT OR VICE VERSA AS THE

02:05:24.483 --> 02:05:25.017
SITUATION CHANGES- YOU DON'T

02:05:25.084 --> 02:05:26.518
WANT TO HAVE A LOSS OF

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:27.586
INFORMATION OR PUT PEOPLE IN THE

02:05:27.653 --> 02:05:29.588

COST CENTER AND IT'S GOING BACK

02:05:40.833 --> 02:05:42.835
AND FORTH BETWEEN THE NINE ONE

02:05:42.902 --> 02:05:44.370
SITES- THAT'LL TAKE PLACE SO THE

02:05:44.436 --> 02:05:47.606
CALL WILL BE ANSWERED- NOW BUT

02:05:47.673 --> 02:05:48.941
IT'S JUST WHEN YOU START THESE

02:05:49.008 --> 02:05:50.542
COMPLEXITIES AND THE CHALLENGES

02:05:50.609 --> 02:05:51.844
OF EMERGING MANAGEMENT WORKING

02:05:51.911 --> 02:05:55.214
WITH. THE VARIOUS- ENTITIES YOU

02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:57.316
CAN YOU CAN NOT WITHOUT A GOOD

02:05:57.383 --> 02:05:59.051
STANDARDIZED PROGRAM. THAT IS IN

02:05:59.118 --> 02:06:01.954
PLACE AND FUNDED AND SUPPORTED

02:06:02.021 --> 02:06:03.589
YOU CAN HAVE THE ABSENT THAT'LL

02:06:03.656 --> 02:06:05.691
EXIST AND WE JUST WANT TO RISK

02:06:05.758 --> 02:06:07.159
ANY. OF PUBLIC SAFETY-

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:08.661
HEALTHCARE AND OF COURSE

02:06:08.727 --> 02:06:10.996
OBVIOUSLY ALL OF THIS HAS TO BE

02:06:11.063 --> 02:06:12.798
WORKING COORDINATION WITH CHS-

02:06:12.865 --> 02:06:15.134
BECAUSE- WE ARE NOT- TAKING A

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:16.135
ROLE IN THE BEHAVIORAL

02:06:16.201 --> 02:06:18.837
SPECIALIST SIDE- BUT WE ARE-

02:06:18.904 --> 02:06:21.340
SUITED AND CAPABLE. OF ASSISTING

02:06:21.407 --> 02:06:23.809
IN THIS TECHNOLOGICAL- ENDEAVOR

02:06:23.876 --> 02:06:25.477
TO ENSURE THAT STANDARDIZATION

02:06:25.544 --> 02:06:26.779
AND IMPLEMENTATION WORKS

02:06:26.845 --> 02:06:28.514
PROPERLY RIGHT BUT ONE OF THE

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:29.815
TOUGHEST CONNECT THAT THAT I

02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:30.816
HAVE HERE IS THAT YOU'RE

02:06:30.883 --> 02:06:32.851
RESPONSIBLE FOR. THE TECHNICAL

02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:34.620
SIDE OF THE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE

02:06:34.687 --> 02:06:36.722
THERE'S NOT A FUSION WITH NINE

02:06:36.789 --> 02:06:38.223
ONE ONE. THAT THE TWO SYSTEMS

02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:43.762
INTERACT. THAT'S FINE BUT- FOR

02:06:43.829 --> 02:06:45.030
THE BEST. AND I KNOW IT'S BABY

02:06:45.097 --> 02:06:47.266
ANOTHER AGE BUT WE'RE I THINK

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:47.833
WE'RE HEADED FOR POTENTIAL

02:06:47.900 --> 02:06:49.735
DISASTER HERE IF CALLS COME IN

02:06:49.802 --> 02:06:51.403
AND THEY GET MANAGED JUST FINE

02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:53.405
WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY. BUT

02:06:53.472 --> 02:06:55.474
THERE'S NO APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

02:06:55.541 --> 02:06:57.309
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THAT CALL

02:06:57.376 --> 02:07:00.546
ULTIMATELY BE ROUTED. THEN WE

02:07:00.612 --> 02:07:02.614
HAVE A VERY NICE TECHNOLOGICAL

02:07:02.681 --> 02:07:05.184
SOLUTION WITH NOTHING WITH

02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:07.553
WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

02:07:07.619 --> 02:07:10.990
TO THE CRISIS THAT. GENERATE THE

02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:13.492
CALL THE FIRST PLACE. YEAH THIS

02:07:13.559 --> 02:07:17.596
MARK- BAKER- AS WE UNDERSTAND IT

02:07:17.663 --> 02:07:19.932
WHICH I REMEMBER- SO I HELP HIM

02:07:19.999 --> 02:07:21.467
TO SERVICES WORKING ON TRAINING

02:07:21.533 --> 02:07:23.469
AND PROTOCOLS THAT WERE THAT

02:07:23.535 --> 02:07:26.105
WILL BE PUT IN PLACE TO ADDRESS

02:07:26.171 --> 02:07:28.640
JUST WHAT YOUR YOUR- YOUR RACING

02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:31.477
HERE AND HOW- THE UP THE- CALLS

02:07:31.543 --> 02:07:33.412
WILL BE ROUTED WHAT. THE

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:35.147
RESPONSIBILITIES WILL BE WHETHER

02:07:35.214 --> 02:07:37.016
IT'S AND I WILL ONCE CENTER OR

02:07:37.082 --> 02:07:39.885
AT NIGHT AT CHATTER- THE METRICS

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:40.619
THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IS TO

02:07:40.686 --> 02:07:43.288
ENSURE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW CALL

02:07:43.355 --> 02:07:44.523
IS LOST- THAT IS ANSWERED IN A

02:09:40.639 --> 02:09:42.508
BURKE WAS ACTUALLY GIVEN THE HHS

WHO ARE OVER. THE THAT THERE

02:09:54.686 --> 02:09:56.054
HASN'T BEEN GREAT COORDINATION

02:09:56.121 --> 02:09:58.056
BETWEEN HHS AND YOU FOLKS AND

02:09:58.123 --> 02:09:59.191
THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY NEEDS TO

02:09:59.258 --> 02:10:01.093
BE A GREAT COORDINATED EFFORT.

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:02.628
IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE A

02:10:02.694 --> 02:10:03.896
SUCCESSFUL UNDERTAKING SO I'M

02:10:03.962 --> 02:10:06.999
HOPING THAT- THINGS WILL. HAVE

02:10:07.065 --> 02:10:08.100

CENTERS ARE CRITICAL AND BEING

02:13:24.329 --> 02:13:26.231
ABLE TO. DETECT THE GROUND

02:13:26.298 --> 02:13:28.533
MOTION AND- ECCENTRICITY THAT

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:29.935
THIS WOULD INCREASE THE CENTER

02:13:30.001 --> 02:13:32.204
DENSITY SECOND IT WOULD FIND-

02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:33.705

THE- YOU KNOW THAT EARTHQUAKE IS

02:14:23.822 --> 02:14:25.590
COMING. OUT SO THAT THE TRADE
