00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:04.368
FOCUSED HERE ON- WHAT HAPPENS

00:50:04.434 --> 00:50:06.303
IN CALIFORNIA AND WE THINK

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:09.172
THAT- WELL THE BILL ACTUALLY

00:50:09.239 --> 00:50:12.976
DOESN'T- DOESN'T ACTUALLY DâN

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:16.046
THE HUNTING ITSELF- THE

00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:17.848
IMPORTATION IN POSSESSION OF

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.182
THOSE TROPHIES WE FEEL LIKE THE

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:21.017
STATE IS ON PRETTY SOLID LEGAL

00:50:21.084 --> 00:50:23.453
GROUND THERE- TO BE TO BE

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.722
ADDRESSING THAT WITHIN OUR OWN

00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:26.990
BORDERS THAT WE DON'T INTRUDE

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:28.358
BOTH ON SITE EASE. AS WELL AS

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:31.094
FEDERAL LAW I WE RECOGNIZE THAT

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:32.062
MAY BE AN ONGOING DEBATE GOING

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:37.667
FORWARD- BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR-

00:50:37.734 --> 00:50:38.668
THIS BILL IS ROUGHLY ABOUT.

00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:40.203
THAT PORTION THE BILL IS REALLY

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:42.506
ABOUT THE TROPHY AND NOT THE

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:44.741
HUNT ITSELF REGARDLESS OF HOW

00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:47.444
FEEL. I'M PERSONALLY. INCOME

00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:51.615
WITH THE NOTION OF. SHOOTING AT

THE AEGIS OF CONSERVING THEM-

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:06.530
BUT I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO SET

00:51:06.596 --> 00:51:08.165
THE EFFICACY OF THAT PRACTICES

00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:09.466
SIDE HERE AND REALLY JUST FOCUS

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:11.968
ON. THE TROPHY ITSELF- AND

00:51:12.035 --> 00:51:13.503

00:58:38.414 --> 00:58:40.650
ARE CONCERNED THAT THESE

00:58:40.717 --> 00:58:43.953
HUNTING LANDS ARE CONSERVED SO

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.389
THAT THESE ANIMALS CAN SURVIVE

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:48.591
AND CONTINUE AND NOT GO

00:58:48.658 --> 00:58:50.560
EXTINCT. IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE

00:58:50.627 --> 00:58:52.161
AND I THINK THAT THE STORIES

00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:54.163
THAT WE GET SENSATIONALIZED

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:56.132
HERE IN UNITED STATES ABOUT

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:57.033

PROTECT THESE ANIMALS AND I

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.290
THINK FOR THE MOST PART WHEN

GOAL IS TO THIN OUT THE HEARD

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:51.414
BEFORE WINTER SET AND WHERE

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.248
THEY MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE

01:05:52.315 --> 01:05:54.483
SURVIVE EITHER SO. I DON'T SEE

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:55.718
THIS IS TAKING AWAY WHAT I

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.853
WOULD CONSTRUED HUMANITARIAN

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.756
REASONS FOR HUNTING BUT- THE

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.858
NOTION THAT. A PASSING THIS

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:04.794
BILL WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.729
THE SURVIVAL OF WIDE LIFE I

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.431
THINK IS JUST A TERRIBLE OVER

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:10.399
REACH IT REMINDS ME OF A- AN

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:12.068
OLD QUOTE WE USED TO HAVE BACK

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.436
IN THE DAY WHEN WE HAD A WAR

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:15.504
GOING ON VIETNAM WAR. KILLING

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:17.973

CHASTITY- AYE CHESTER- I JUST

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:24.180
DON'T THINK AND THAT'S A QUOTE

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:25.348
THAT QUOTE I'M- FOR THE A

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:27.350
BUMPER STICKER. THEY ACTUALLY I

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.118
THINK THEY DID I THINK THEY DID

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:30.720
BACK IN THOSE DAYS BUT THE BUT

01:06:30.786 --> 01:06:34.123
THE POINT IS THAT. AT THAT THIS

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:37.426
IS THE- THIS IS NOT GOING TO

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:40.229
END THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO-

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:41.397

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:47.103
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE COME

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:49.205

THE RESISTANCE DOWN THE ROAD

01:44:45.379 --> 01:44:46.947
NOT A POLICY COMMITTEE BUT

01:44:47.014 --> 01:44:49.249
MAYBE AROUND THE COST OF

01:44:49.316 --> 01:44:51.318
IMPLEMENTATION I WOULD JUST

01:44:51.385 --> 01:44:53.086
ARGUE IN ADVANCE OF THAT

01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:56.390
REVIEW. THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL

01:44:56.456 --> 01:45:00.627
INVESTMENT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND.

01:45:03.096 --> 01:45:05.365
IMPACTS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS

01:45:05.432 --> 01:45:08.502
SOME ARGUE THAT COVERT NINETEEN

01:45:08.568 --> 01:45:10.537
IS A MANIFESTATION OF THE

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:13.106
CLIMATE CRISIS. MORE RECENTLY

01:45:13.173 --> 01:45:14.775
ARE WILD FIRE CRISIS IN

01:45:14.841 --> 01:45:17.010
CALIFORNIA HAS DISTORTED OUR

01:45:17.077 --> 01:45:20.347
STATE'S BUDGET IT'S IMPACTED

01:45:20.414 --> 01:45:23.216
MILLIONS OF RESIDENTS. MANY

01:45:23.283 --> 01:45:25.752
TRAGIC LOSSES OF HUMAN LIFE AS

01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:28.121
WELL AS PROPERTY WERE AT THE

01:45:28.188 --> 01:45:30.057
PRECIPICE WITH THE CLIMATE

01:45:30.123 --> 01:45:33.593
CRISIS OF NEEDING TO RETOOL.

01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.595
HOW WE LOOK AT BUDGETING IN THE

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:37.631
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW WE LOOK

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:39.566
AT BUILDING AND PROTECTING A

01:45:39.633 --> 01:45:41.201
FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND

01:45:41.268 --> 01:45:42.936
GRAND CHILDREN IN GENERATIONS

01:45:43.003 --> 01:45:47.874
AHEAD. TO ME THIS IS A MODEST

01:45:47.941 --> 01:45:51.078
STEP BUT A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:53.447
ONE SO THAT WE CAN BEST-

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:55.615
MANAGER LIMITED RESOURCES AND

01:45:55.682 --> 01:45:57.517
ARE STRESSED RESOURCES TO

01:45:57.584 --> 01:45:59.386
PROTECT OUR SHARED IN COMMON

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:01.822
FUTURE SO NOT REALLY A QUESTION

01:46:01.888 --> 01:46:03.724
BUT A COMMENT IN SUPPORT AND

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:06.560
I'D BE GLAD TO MOVE THE BILL AT

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:08.095
THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU.

01:46:08.161 --> 01:46:11.164
THANK YOU SIR BYE SIR. THANK

01:46:11.231 --> 01:46:15.001
YOU VERY MUCH- I AGREE WITH

01:46:15.068 --> 01:46:16.503
THAT WITH SENATOR MINING AYE I

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:19.740
THINK THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS

01:46:19.806 --> 01:46:21.208
TO BUILD AN ECONOMIC MODEL THAT

01:46:21.274 --> 01:46:23.076
INCLUDES RURAL CALIFORNIA SO

01:46:23.143 --> 01:46:24.044
THAT WE'RE NOT JUST WORRIED

01:46:24.111 --> 01:46:27.714
ABOUT YOU KNOW. THE OCEAN

01:46:27.781 --> 01:46:30.917
RISING SEA LEVEL RISE AND-

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:32.519
CLIFFS FALLING DOWN NOT IN THE

01:46:32.586 --> 01:46:34.354
OCEAN BUT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT

01:46:34.421 --> 01:46:36.423
THE IMPACT THAT THE ACTIVITY

01:46:36.490 --> 01:46:39.993
HAS IN A BASIN THAT HAS NO WAY

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.995
FOR THE ERROR THE POLLUTED AIR

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:42.596
TO GET OUT OF IT ONCE IT GETS

01:46:42.662 --> 01:46:44.865
IN THERE- AND THE TREMENDOUS

01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:46.366
IMPACT IT HAD IT HAS ON THE

01:46:46.433 --> 01:46:48.034
HEALTH OF THE INHABITANTS BUT

01:46:48.101 --> 01:46:50.704
ALSO. THE ROLE THAT AGRICULTURE

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:53.607
PLAYS IN- SO QUITE SO QUITE

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:57.377
STRING CARBON AND- YOU KNOW THE

01:46:57.444 --> 01:47:01.081
I THINK THIS- THIS WHOLE

01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:04.017
COALBED. PANDEMIC HAS GIVEN US

01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:06.119
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE. THE

01:47:06.186 --> 01:47:10.524
IMPACT. OF OUR- DAY TO DAY LIFE

01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:13.894
HOW IT IMPACTS. OUR ENVIRONMENT

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.228
AND THE FACT THAT THE AIR IS

01:47:15.295 --> 01:47:17.130
pNEVER BEEN CLEANER THAT THE

01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:20.834
ROADS ARE ARE PRETTY EMPTY AND

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:22.769
THAT ALL OVER THE WORLD YOU'RE

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:25.305
SEEING WILDLIFE. COME BACK IN A

01:47:25.372 --> 01:47:27.073
WAY THAT NONE OF US WOULD HAVE

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:29.943
PREDICTED- SO YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:47:30.010 --> 01:47:31.711
SOME THERE'S SOME ECONOMIC

01:47:31.778 --> 01:47:34.815
ISSUES THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO

01:47:34.881 --> 01:47:37.851
LOOK AT THAT CAN HELP US GET-

01:47:37.918 --> 01:47:40.720
ON THAT CAN HELP US TO REDUCE

01:47:40.787 --> 01:47:42.622
THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

01:47:42.689 --> 01:47:45.525
MUCH FASTER AND- SO I THINK YOU

01:47:45.592 --> 01:47:47.427
KNOW SO I WOULD ASK THE RATHER

01:47:47.494 --> 01:47:49.196
THAT THEN BE PRESCRIPTIVE IN

01:47:49.262 --> 01:47:52.365
THIS. LEGISLATION THAT WE

01:47:52.432 --> 01:47:54.000
PROVIDE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:47:54.067 --> 01:47:54.935
LOOKING AT THINGS A LITTLE BIT

01:47:55.001 --> 01:47:57.370
DIFFERENTLY- BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:47:57.437 --> 01:47:58.772
OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD

01:47:58.839 --> 01:47:59.606
THAT ARE DOING THINGS

01:47:59.673 --> 01:48:01.975
DIFFERENTLY AND ARE HAVING SOME

01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:04.477
SOME SUCCESS SO I'M IN SUPPORT

01:48:04.544 --> 01:48:06.513
OF THE BILL. OUT SO EN AND SO

01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:07.747
AS A FOOTNOTE I THINK YOU

01:48:07.814 --> 01:48:08.982
SHOULD OUT AT THE DEPARTMENT

01:48:09.049 --> 01:48:11.151
FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AS ONE OF

01:48:11.218 --> 01:48:13.386
THE CONSULTING DEPARTMENTS SO

01:48:13.453 --> 01:48:14.588
THAT WERE MAKING SURE THAT

01:48:14.654 --> 01:48:16.523
WE'RE WE'RE INCLUDING THAT AS

01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:18.859
WELL. THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST

01:48:18.925 --> 01:48:20.527
SAY THAT MAKES A 100% SENSE

01:48:20.594 --> 01:48:23.330
AND- OF THE WAS IN TEND TO BE

01:48:23.396 --> 01:48:25.498
IN- OVERSEEING THE TIME LOOKING

01:48:25.565 --> 01:48:27.200
PASTINJECTED THE SPEARS AND

01:48:27.267 --> 01:48:29.002
AGRICULTURE AND IT'S LIKE THIS

01:48:29.069 --> 01:48:30.637
YEAR. I MEAN THE MEGADRIVE IS

01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:32.105
HERE NOW. GROUNDWATER

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:33.540
SUBSIDENCE HERE RIGHT NOW

01:48:33.607 --> 01:48:35.609
POTENTIAL FOLLOWING OF YOU KNOW

01:48:35.675 --> 01:48:36.943
YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS IT'S ALL

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:39.813
VERY SCARY SO- WE NEED TO BE

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.314
MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT BUT

01:48:41.381 --> 01:48:42.716
MAYBE IF WE CAN BE SORT OF MORE

01:48:42.782 --> 01:48:44.451
COMPREHENSIVE IT WON'T. YOU

01:48:44.517 --> 01:48:45.051
KNOW WE DON'T NEED TO SIR TO

01:48:45.118 --> 01:48:47.854
DRILL PIECE BY PIECE BUT- I

01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:48.755
APPRECIATE THAT. ANY OTHER

01:48:48.822 --> 01:48:49.990
COMMENTS FROM THE DíAS CENTER

01:48:50.056 --> 01:48:53.860
JACKSON. IS I TO WILLOW WANTED

01:48:53.927 --> 01:48:55.629
THANK YOU FOR THIS. YOU KNOW

01:48:55.695 --> 01:48:56.696
WE'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME

01:48:56.763 --> 01:48:58.999
CLIMATE CHANGE IS OCCURRING AND

01:48:59.065 --> 01:49:00.901
IT IS OCCURRING ALL OVER. IT

01:49:00.967 --> 01:49:04.271
DID IT'S NOTHING THAT IS UNIQUE

01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:05.272
TO ANY PARTICULAR PART OF THE

01:49:05.338 --> 01:49:08.575
STATE. OR THE COUNTRY- AND IN

01:49:08.642 --> 01:49:10.710
FACT I REMEMBER YEARS AGO WHEN

01:49:10.777 --> 01:49:12.812
WE HAD SOMEONE TESTIFYING I

01:49:12.879 --> 01:49:15.115
THINK IT WAS A SCIENTIST ABOUT.

01:49:15.181 --> 01:49:17.517
THE PROSPECTS OF WHAT THE

01:49:17.584 --> 01:49:19.219
CHANGES IN THE CLIMATE MEAN-

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:21.187
USING THE OCEAN AS AN EXAMPLE

01:49:21.254 --> 01:49:22.222
BUT THE FACT THAT WHEN THE

01:49:22.289 --> 01:49:24.958
WATER TEMPERATURE RISES HE

01:49:25.025 --> 01:49:27.894
GIVES RISE ALSO TO BACTERIA

01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:29.329
THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:30.764
AND THAT IT AFFECTS THE ENTIRE

01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:32.565
FOOD CHAIN WHETHER IT'S IN THE

01:49:32.632 --> 01:49:34.334
OCEAN WHETHER IT'S IN THE

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:36.036
CENTRAL VALLEY WHETHER IT'S IN

01:49:36.102 --> 01:49:37.971
YOU KNOW MINNESOTA. OR KANSAS

01:49:38.038 --> 01:49:40.307
AND SO- I THINK THIS IS

01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:42.142
SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT THIS

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:43.910
IS A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW WE

01:49:43.977 --> 01:49:46.212
HAVE THIS VIRUS AND NOBODY'S

01:49:46.279 --> 01:49:47.280
EVER SEEN OR HEARD OF BEFORE.

01:49:47.347 --> 01:49:49.215
MY FEAR IS THAT GIVEN THE

01:49:49.282 --> 01:49:51.017
CHANGES THAT THE CLIMATE IS

01:49:51.084 --> 01:49:53.386
GOING TO THIS IS. NOT THE LAST

01:49:53.453 --> 01:49:54.788
THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE AND WE'VE

01:49:54.854 --> 01:49:56.823
SEEN THEM COMING OVER THE

01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:58.491
COURSE WE WERE WE STARTED WITH.

01:49:58.558 --> 01:50:00.660
I THINK WAS SARS IN THE BOWL OF

01:50:00.727 --> 01:50:02.195
WHEN YOU THINK OVER THE LAST

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:03.229
FIFTEEN YEARS THE NUMBER OF

01:50:03.296 --> 01:50:05.131
THESE POTENTIAL PANDEMICS THAT

01:50:05.198 --> 01:50:08.768
HAVE OCCURRED ENDING MEASURE

01:50:08.835 --> 01:50:10.136
THAT WHICH MINOR SEES A

01:50:10.203 --> 01:50:10.737
SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING THEY'RE

01:50:10.804 --> 01:50:12.205
CONNECTED. BETWEEN THE INCREASE

01:50:12.272 --> 01:50:16.142
THE TEMPERATURE. AND THE

01:50:16.209 --> 01:50:19.946
CREATION OF ALL OF THESE NEW.

01:50:20.013 --> 01:50:21.214
NO POP A BOWL BY THREATENING

01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:24.050
COULD. I IT. WHEN WE ALL COME.

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:26.453
ON THIS AND SO I APPRECIATE THE

01:50:26.519 --> 01:50:28.755
EFFORT AND- I'M GLAD THAT WE

01:50:28.822 --> 01:50:31.191
ARE TALKING NOW IT IS SOMETHING

01:50:31.257 --> 01:50:33.326
THAT AFFECTS US ALL- AND DOES

01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:35.028
NOT LIMIT ITSELF TO ONE

01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:37.564
PARTICULAR PART. OF AN AREA AND

01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:39.799
IT'S JUST REAL AND- IT

01:50:39.866 --> 01:50:42.535
SHOULDN'T BE POLITICAL- SO I

01:50:42.602 --> 01:50:44.304
HOPE THAT IS A CAUSE FOR WE ARE

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:45.972
ALL SITTING AT THE TABLE

01:50:46.039 --> 01:50:49.676
TOGETHER AND- WORKING AT COM.

01:50:49.743 --> 01:50:52.145
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FOR THE

01:50:52.212 --> 01:50:55.882
S. NOW WE DO HAVE A MOTION I

MONNING- SO YOU MAY CLOSE AT

01:51:00.286 --> 01:51:01.855
