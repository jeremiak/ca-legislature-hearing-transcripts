REALLY CONSTRUCT THAT BUT IT

00:47:57.608 --> 00:48:00.077
WOULD ALLOW TO INVEST TO ONE

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:03.046

THEY'RE DOING TWO VERY IMPORTANT

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:46.629
THINGS. FIRST IT ENSURES THAT

SECONDLY THAT A PERCENTAGE OF

PARTS BUT THAT MIGHT I JUST WANT

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.635
TO ASK SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW I

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:16.171
AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF SKILLED

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:20.409
LABOR- WHEN PUBLIC MONEY IS

01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:22.444
BEING USED AND THAT IS THE LAW

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.646
SO. IS THERE A DISCONNECT HERE

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:26.782
WHAT IS SPECIFICALLY I MEAN WE

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:28.617
DO NEED TO MAKE SURE IT'S

01:16:28.684 --> 01:16:30.218
SKILLED LABOR THAT WOULD BE

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:31.620
BUILDING- ON THESE CAMPUSES SO

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:34.556
WHAT IS THE- THE LANGUAGE. AND I

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:37.125
DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE THE RIGHT

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:37.759

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:42.497
MAYBE THE- REPRESENTATIVE OF.

01:16:42.564 --> 01:16:44.900
OKAY SO THE QUESTION IS WOULDN'T

01:16:44.967 --> 01:16:46.735
WHEN SKILLED LABOR TO READY BE

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:48.470

THAT IS BEING ISSUED A

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:52.574
PREVAILING WAGE S REQUIRED SO

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:54.343
THE PAYMENT OF PREVAILING WAGES

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:55.844
THE COR CHOIR WENT WITH PUBLIC

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:57.679
MONEY IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT TO

01:16:57.746 --> 01:16:59.047

PREVAILING WAGE THAT'S WHAT

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:04.987
WE'RE SEEKING AND THAT WOULD

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:06.154
REQUIRE THAT A CERTAIN

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:09.191
PERCENTAGE. OF WORKERS ON SITE

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:10.559

FORWARD I THINK IT'S A GREAT

01:19:01.736 --> 01:19:03.271
CONCEPT ONE OF THINGS I HEAR

01:19:03.338 --> 01:19:04.639
MOST FROM EMPLOYERS IN MY

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:05.474
DISTRICT AND- WHICH ARE

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.408
UNIVERSITIES AND COMMUNITY

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:08.777
COLLEGES- IS THAT IS REALLY HARD

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:10.412
TO RECRUIT A WORKFORCE WHEN THEY

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:12.147

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:13.048
IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY WORK

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:14.649
AND I THINK THAT THIS DOES A

01:19:14.716 --> 01:19:16.518
GREAT JOB OF TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.353
TRAVEL FOR STUDENTS AND FACULTY

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.755
ON WHICH IS. DEEPLY NEEDED I DO

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:23.325
HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS IN REGARDS

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:24.926
TO THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:26.228
WOULD BE ATTACHED TO THIS WOULD

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:28.363
THIS BE AN INITIAL WOULD THERE

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.298
BE A BREAKDOWN OF INITIAL

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:31.500
FUNDING THROUGH CERTAIN BUDGET

01:19:31.566 --> 01:19:33.368
YEARS WE JUST THIS BUT- FOR THE

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.403
NEXT THIRTY YEARS HOW HOW IS

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:37.205
GONNA ACTUALLY WORK IN THE

01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:39.541
FINANCIAL POINT- WELL THIS

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.343
BUILDS UPON. WHAT WE DID LAST

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:42.944
YEAR WE PUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS

01:19:43.011 --> 01:19:44.779
IN LAST YEAR. AT AND THE

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:46.481
REALITIES WE GOT. AN AMAZING

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:48.116
AMOUNT NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:49.784
AND NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO GO

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.019
AROUND TO FUND THESE PROJECTS

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:52.621
THROUGH. SO THAT SHOWS THAT THE

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:54.389
DEMAND IS THERE. FOR SHOVEL

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.758
READY PROJECTS TO PUT PEOPLE TO

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:57.659
WORK AND HELP WITH THE HOUSING

01:19:57.726 --> 01:19:59.528
CRISIS SO. WE'RE COMING BACK

01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:01.530
THIS YEAR. YOU KNOW DOUBLING UP

01:20:01.596 --> 01:20:03.865
FOR EVEN MORE. WITH FIVE BILLION

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:06.801
ONE TIME INFUSION OF- FIVE

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:08.470
BILLIONDOLLARS OF ONE TIME.

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:11.039
INVESTMENT AS YOU KNOW FROM THE

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:13.108
BUDGET DISCUSSIONS WITH RON-

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:15.010
THERE IS ONE TIME MONEY AND TO

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:17.179
HAVE A- SURGE IN ONE TIME TAX

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:18.113
REVENUE IN THIS YEAR'S-

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:20.115
PROJECTED BUDGET. SO THE IDEA

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:21.983
THERE IS TO USE SOME OF THOSE

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:23.852
ONE TIME MONIES. FOR CAPITAL

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:25.587

THIS YEAR'S BUDGET RELATED.

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:32.928
AGAIN MEASURES AND SO FORTH THIS

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:35.163
IS A GREAT USE OF ONE TIME

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:36.631
INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY. TO DEAL

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:39.301

WOULD. WOULD IT. WHEN WOULD IT

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:51.580
WOULD BE A THIRTY YEAR LOAN WITH

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:53.381
THOSE PAYMENTS START YOU KNOW

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:55.016
IMMEDIATELY I'M TRYING TO

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:56.418
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PAY BACK

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:57.852
WOULD BE ON THIS IF WE'RE GONNA

01:20:57.919 --> 01:20:59.588
HAVE THIS RECURRING REVOLVING

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:01.957

AND I ALSO WANT TO BRING UP YOU

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:26.748

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.274
OVERSIGHT BY APPLAUD THE EFFORTS

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:35.643

INCLUDE A SKILLED AND TRAINED

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:43.918
WORKFORCE. AND I KIND OF

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:47.021
DIFFERENTIATE AND WHEN I LOOKED

01:23:47.088 --> 01:23:47.722
AT A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT.

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:48.390
VERSUS SKILLED AND TRAINED

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:49.824
WORKFORCE. NOW I WAS ON A

01:23:49.891 --> 01:23:51.159
COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD ALL

01:23:51.226 --> 01:23:52.727
FOLKS HERE HEARD ME SAY THAT

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:54.295
OVERALL RATING. BUT BUT THERE IS

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:55.430
A BIG DIFFERENCE BECAUSE PROJECT

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:56.431
LABOR AGREEMENTS WITHOUT A

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:58.867
COMPLIANCE PIECE TO IT. LEADS TO

01:23:58.933 --> 01:23:59.667
THE SAME ACTIONS THAT WERE

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:01.736
TRYING TO PREVENT SO OFTEN TIMES

01:24:01.803 --> 01:24:02.604
AT LEAST WHEN I GOT ON THE

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:04.205
COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD. AND

01:24:04.272 --> 01:24:07.242
THEY HAD A FRAMEWORK FOR PROJECT

01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:08.143
LABOR AGREEMENT. WITHOUT A

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:11.079
ROBUST FULLY FUNDED- COMPLIANCE

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:12.981
PROGRAM IT REALLY DID MEAN

01:24:13.047 --> 01:24:13.615
ANYTHING. THAT'S WHY. WE

01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:15.049
IMPLEMENT WE WENT TOWARDS A

01:24:15.116 --> 01:24:16.184
SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE

01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:17.919
BECAUSE- A SKILLED AND TRAINED

01:24:17.986 --> 01:24:19.788
WORKFORCE. REALLY DOES HAVE ALL

01:24:19.854 --> 01:24:21.356
THE COMPLIANCE PIECES IN THE

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:23.191
FRAMEWORK. TO DO WHAT WE WANTED

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:25.460
TO DO. GIVE EXAMPLES BECAUSE WE

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:27.796
HAD. WITH GOOD CONTRACTORS OF

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:29.364
THE DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT WE HAD

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:30.732
SOME BAD ACTORS. WE'RE ON PAPER

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:32.467
IT SHOWED THAT THEY PAID THE

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:34.402
FORTY HOURS WHEN THE AFFIDAVIT-

01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:38.406
OR WHEN YOU TALK TO THE EMPLOYEE

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:40.041
WORK FORCE OF ONLY PAY TWENTY

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:41.509
DOLLARS. AND IT WASN'T UNTIL WE

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:42.477
PROTECT. WORKFORCE IN PLACE BUT-

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:43.711
WITH WITH THE SKILLED AND

01:24:43.778 --> 01:24:45.647
TRAINED WORKFORCE YOU HAVE A

01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:46.448
BONAFIDE. PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY

01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:47.849
DOES ENSURE THAT THE EMPLOYEE

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:48.850
GETS PAID WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.652
TO BE PAID. BECAUSE THERE IS

01:24:50.718 --> 01:24:52.253
THERE IS. ADVOCACY AND

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.122
REPRESENTATION FOR THE EMPLOYEE.

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:56.124
A SIDE OF ALL THAT THE PROJECTS

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:59.093
ARE MUCH BETTER. WE WENT FROM A

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.261
PROGRAM THAT WAS DOING OVER RUNS

01:25:00.328 --> 01:25:02.897
10% AND ABOVE AND GETTING-

01:25:02.964 --> 01:25:04.666
GETTING- SETTLED THROUGH COURT

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:06.668
PROCESSES. TO A PROGRAM THAT

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:09.437
WAS. THAT WAS ON TIME AND THE

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:10.638
PROJECT WILL WORK IN THE WAY

01:25:10.705 --> 01:25:13.074
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SO THERE

01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:14.209
IS A- BENEFIT TO THE- TO THE

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:17.045
PROGRAM NOT JUST A DRIVE TO SEE

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:18.246
HOW CHEAP YOU CAN GET THE

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:19.948
PROGRAM WHEN YOU BID. ON ON

01:25:20.014 --> 01:25:21.850
THOSE ON THE LOWEST BID. SO THIS

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:23.585
IS A BENEFIT TO THAT THAT'S

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:24.919
WHAT. I THINK IT'S WORTH THE

01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:28.556
CONVERSATION OF HAVING. A

01:25:28.623 --> 01:25:29.757
SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE IN

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:32.126

FINDS MY MOM YOU THAT WE CAN

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:35.230
TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC ABOUT.

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:37.098
WHEN I ALSO WORKED AT THE BORDER

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:39.834
LEGAL WE DID DO ON PROJECTS THAT

01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:41.236
WERE SAID TO HAVE HAD SKILLED

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:43.171
AND FOR A PROJECT LABOR

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:45.607
AGREEMENT. MULTI TASK. SWEEP THE

01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:46.574
RATE WHATEVER ONE CAUGHT WHERE

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:50.178
YOU. CLEARLY ON PAPER LOOK LIKE

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:51.513
IT BUT IT WASN'T. A. N. N. IN

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:53.681
THESE WERE ACTIONS DONE WITH CAL

01:25:53.748 --> 01:25:55.617
OSHA DEPARTMENT OF IT ALSO

01:25:55.683 --> 01:25:57.752

EN FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. SO THERE

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:07.262
IS A BENEFIT TO DOING THAT WITH

01:26:07.328 --> 01:26:08.663
A PUBLIC FUNDS. WHAT I STRUGGLE

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:10.532
WITH THE ISN'T THE HOUSING ISN'T

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:11.766
THE CONCEPT ISN'T ISN'T THAT

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:13.401
DOING THIS IT'S THAT WE DON'T

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:15.303
INSURE THAT THESE DOLLARS. ARE

01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:17.372

WORKFORCE ENSURES THAT WE DO

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.547

01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:40.875
STUDENTS HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:42.910
HEAD AND- AND THAT'S IMPORTANT.

01:29:42.977 --> 01:29:43.978
TO KEEP THE COST DOWN BECAUSE WE

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:47.215
KNOW. THAT FEES TUITION ALL OF

01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:49.083
THAT THAT'S ALMOST A CONTROLLED

01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:51.319
COST GIVEN THE BUDGET THE WAY

01:29:51.385 --> 01:29:53.488
IT'S PLAYED OUT OVER THE PAST

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:54.055
DECADE BUT WHAT'S NOT UNDER

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:56.724
CONTROL. IS OUR COST OF LIVING-

01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:58.192
WHICH IS JUST SPIRALED OUT OF

01:29:58.259 --> 01:30:00.061
CONTROL IT'S TOTALLY OUT OF

01:30:00.128 --> 01:30:03.164
HAND- AND SO- SO IT'S REALLY ON

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:05.366
I THINK THE PRESSURE IS BACK ON

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:07.535

AMBITIOUS AND A VERY IMPORTANT.

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:01.502
I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:06.207
THEN ALSO WITH THE- TOLLAN IDEA

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:09.844
- THIS IS- TO PUT THE- HIGHER

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:13.080
EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS UC SYSTEM

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:14.081

HOUSING. OTHER THAN- EDUCATION.

01:34:23.524 --> 01:34:26.527
HOW TO APPROACH THE HOUSING

01:34:26.594 --> 01:34:32.366
ISSUES- THAT'S IMPORTANT TO. SO-

01:34:32.433 --> 01:34:34.035
WHETHER WE SHOULD DO THAT THE

01:34:34.101 --> 01:34:37.071
THAT IS A MILE OF ARCHING YOU

MORE SPECIFICALLY IF YOU CAN

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:44.245
CLARIFY. OVER THIRTY YEARS SO

01:34:44.311 --> 01:34:47.114
WITH A NO INTEREST- SO EACH

01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:48.916
CAMPER SO WHEN THEY BORROWED THE

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:53.387
FUND- THEY HAVE TO PRESENT THAT

01:34:53.454 --> 01:34:55.790
TO THE STATE THE HOW THEY WENT

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:58.759
OUT PAY BACK. THE LOAN AMOUNT OF

01:34:58.826 --> 01:35:01.896
FOR THE- BUILDING PROJECT. THAT

01:35:01.962 --> 01:35:03.864
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE QUESTION

01:35:03.931 --> 01:35:08.069

BUILDING FOR THE HOUSING FOR THE

01:35:15.643 --> 01:35:17.578
FACULTY BECAUSE I SEE THREE

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:18.679
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES FOR

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:22.817
STUDENTS FACULTY AND OTHER STAFF

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:25.286
MEMBERS- SO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES

01:35:25.352 --> 01:35:26.887
I'M SURE THAT'D BE ARE

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:28.989
SEGREGATED- SEGREGATED ASAP

01:35:29.056 --> 01:35:33.294
SEPARATE- SO- I'M SURE FOR THE

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.296
STUDENTS TO OR BE- JUST LACKED

01:35:35.362 --> 01:35:36.931
APARTMENTS UP FOR. MONTH TO

MONTH- INTERNAL OR YOU TO LEASE

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:45.272

THE FOR THE ARE- FACULTY AND UP

01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:50.478
ON ON THE STAFF MEMBERS SHOW A

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:52.546
WILL THIS BE THEIR OWN PURCHASE

01:35:52.613 --> 01:35:54.315
SO WHAT WOULD THIS BE OUT FOR

01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:58.886
AGAIN A LEASING PROGRAM- SO YOU

01:35:58.953 --> 01:35:59.753
MENTIONED THAT THE FUN THOUGH

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:03.991
WHAT IS. ROLLER ROLLER ABOUT THE

01:36:04.058 --> 01:36:08.362
AND OUT FOR IS. SO YOU GO INTO

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:11.332
THAT THE LEVEL YES. WHY CAN'T

01:36:11.398 --> 01:36:13.968
AND NINE QUESTIONS NOT TO SO LET

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:17.371
ME TRY TO REMEMBER THEM. THE

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:19.840
FIRST THING IS WE'RE NOT TELLING

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:23.144
CAMPUS IS TO BUILD HOUSING

01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:24.645
THEY'RE BUILDING HOUSING ANYWAY.

01:36:24.712 --> 01:36:26.413
ALL YOU CAN SEE THIS YEAR IN

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.283
FRONT OF ALL AGES THE ISSUE IS

01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:30.417
THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY HIGH

01:36:30.484 --> 01:36:32.353
INTEREST RATES EVEN THIS LOW

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:34.054
INTEREST RATE ERA. AND THE

01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:35.422
COMPETE BECAUSE THEY HAVE LIKE A

01:36:35.489 --> 01:36:37.491
DEBT CAPACITY ON THE SYSTEM SO

01:36:37.558 --> 01:36:39.927
THEY'RE BUILDING. BUILDINGS AND

01:36:39.994 --> 01:36:41.295
STRUCTURES ON THE CAMPUS SO

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:42.563
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH DEBT

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:44.198
CAPACITY THANK THEY CAN HOUSE

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:48.169
ABOUT US HAVING THESE LOANS OVER

01:36:48.235 --> 01:36:49.737
HERE IT ALLOWS THEM. TO BUILD

01:36:49.803 --> 01:36:51.005
BUT THERE THESE PROJECTS ARE

01:36:51.071 --> 01:36:53.040
SHOVEL READY ANYWAY THERE'S

01:36:53.107 --> 01:36:54.508
MASSIVE DEMAND USUALLY IT'S

01:36:54.575 --> 01:36:56.043
RISKY TO BUILD A STUDENT HOUSING

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:57.077
THEIR STUDENTS THERE ARE

01:36:57.144 --> 01:36:58.812
PLAYING. I NEED A PLACE TO STAY

01:36:58.879 --> 01:37:00.781
SO IT'S THAT'S NOT A SUPER RISKY

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:02.082
PROPOSITION TO BUILD MORE

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:03.918
HOUSING AT THESE CAMPUSES SO.

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:05.119
THIS JUST ALLOWS THEM TO BORROW

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:07.588
MONEY AT AT THE AT A LOWER RATE

01:37:07.655 --> 01:37:09.590
AND NOT HAVE TO BE STRETCHED

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:10.491
WITH THE RATHER CAMPUS NEEDS

01:37:10.558 --> 01:37:12.593
WITH THAT CAPACITY. IT'LL BE A

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:15.062
THIRTY YEAR. TERM JUST LIKE YOU

01:37:15.129 --> 01:37:15.930
JUST LIKE THEY WOULD DO TODAY

01:37:15.996 --> 01:37:18.232
WITH THE BANK THEY WOULD PAY A

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:20.267
PRINCIPAL PAYMENT EACH MONTH.

01:37:20.334 --> 01:37:21.368
THEY WOULDN'T PAY THE INTERESTED

OVERALL THEIR PAYMENTS WILL BE

01:37:22.736 --> 01:37:24.805

AND WE'RE NOT REINVENTING THE

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:31.639

01:38:31.705 --> 01:38:32.840
MONTHS AGO WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT

01:38:32.906 --> 01:38:34.742

PROJECTS WE DON'T WANT PIE IN

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:42.750
THE SKY PROJECTS THAT ARE GONNA

FALL APART- SO WE WANT TO MAKE

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:50.224
SURE THESE PROJECTS. A PENCIL

01:38:50.291 --> 01:38:51.792

AND ALSO BE TO PAY THE SERVICE

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:56.597
THEM SO IT IS A SIMPLE RETURN SO

01:38:56.664 --> 01:38:59.099
WE CAN PHRASE IT AS A FI YOU ARE

01:38:59.166 --> 01:39:00.200
PROVIDING. JUST A NO INTEREST-

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:01.568
THE BUILDING FUND THEM MAY

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:03.537
DEVELOP WORD NO EXTRA. INTEREST

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:06.140
IT'S JUST LIKE IF THEY HAVE TO

01:39:06.206 --> 01:39:08.175
GO TO A COMMERCIAL. LENDERS SO

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:10.344
ENCOURAGING CAMPUS IS- TO-

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:12.212
EITHER BY WHAT BEARDED TO SOAK

01:39:12.279 --> 01:39:14.515
UP PURCHASES ARE INCLUDED WITH

01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:18.619
THESE FUNDS OF. RATHER THAN

01:39:18.686 --> 01:39:20.154
BUILDING FROM THE SCRATCH- I'M

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:21.488
NOT SURE WHERE THAT PRESCRIPTIVE

01:39:21.555 --> 01:39:23.390
AG I GUESS THE UNIVERSITY COULD

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.326
GO AND PURCHASE AN APARTMENT

01:39:25.392 --> 01:39:26.360
BUILDING IF THAT ONE WAS THAT IT

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:29.163
WAS THERE BUT- I THINK MOST THE

01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:31.398
PROJECT'S. DEBUT THEY'RE ABLE TO

01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:33.901
GET MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK BY

01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:35.002
HAVING SHARED UNITS WITH YOU

01:39:35.069 --> 01:39:38.806
NOW- AND LOWER THE COSTS SO. I

01:39:38.872 --> 01:39:39.807
THINK MOST NAY WOULD BUILD

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.575
THEMSELVES YEAH I HAVE A TENSE

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:43.577
UP BUT OF COURSE INSTANCES TO

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:45.512
JUST OUT OUT TO ADD ONE MORE

01:39:45.579 --> 01:39:48.282
QUESTION. THAT THE AS YOUR HEARD

01:39:48.349 --> 01:39:50.551
DOES SO MANY OPPOSITION STUFF

01:39:50.617 --> 01:39:56.223
FROM- BUILDING INDUSTRY- AND- I

01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:57.825
THOUGHT THE I WAS UNDER THE

01:39:57.891 --> 01:40:00.260
IMPRESSION THAT THE ANY PUBLIC

01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:04.565
HOUSING- EGG- DEMANDS OF

01:40:04.631 --> 01:40:08.335
REQUIRES- TO HIRE- DO UNION

01:40:08.402 --> 01:40:11.205
WORKERS- AND THE TO PAID THE

01:40:11.271 --> 01:40:13.607
PREVAILING WAGE ANYWAY. AND THE

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:16.777
WHY IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:19.513
IS- YOU'LL YOU'LL- BUILDING

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:21.448
PROJECT BUT THE CAMPUS IS- AND

01:40:21.515 --> 01:40:23.851
THE EXISTING AT ALL. YEAH I

01:40:23.917 --> 01:40:25.719
THINK WE TRY TO ANSWER THAT TOO

01:40:25.786 --> 01:40:27.121
WITH SOME MEMBER- ONCE QUESTION

01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:28.822
SO THIS IS PUBLIC MONEY WE

01:40:28.889 --> 01:40:31.291
REQUIRE PREVAILING WAGE BUT AS

01:40:31.358 --> 01:40:33.193
THAT WITNESS FROM THE STATE

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:34.461
CONSTRUCTION BUILDING TRADES

01:40:34.528 --> 01:40:36.196
ALLUDED THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A

01:40:36.263 --> 01:40:37.231
REQUIREMENT THEY HAVE SKILLED

DEVELOPMENT FOR THAT WITH A

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:42.129
DIFFERENT SET OF RULES THAT THE

CONVERSATION THIS YEAR IS ABOUT.

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:45.766
IS ABOUT LARGER DEVELOPMENT WITH

PUBLIC FUNDS AND SO THAT THAT

01:41:49.036 --> 01:41:51.705

01:44:07.874 --> 01:44:10.410
PUBLIC THING. SO I KNOW THERE'S-

01:44:10.477 --> 01:44:12.546
CONVERSATIONS WITH THAT LIKE I

01:44:12.613 --> 01:44:14.681
SAID OF TO SAY IT AGAIN WITH THE

01:44:14.748 --> 01:44:15.682
STATE BUILDING TRADES LEADERSHIP

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:17.451
AND WITH OUR LEADERSHIP ON ALL

01:44:17.517 --> 01:44:19.286
THESE. SKILLED AND TRAINED.

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:21.655
IDEAS FOR A BUNCH OF BILLS NOT

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:23.457
JUST THIS ONE ON. AFFORDABLE

01:44:23.523 --> 01:44:25.692
HOUSING BILLS THAT ARE YOU KNOW

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:26.827
PRIVATE DEVELOPERS IN THIS AND

01:44:26.893 --> 01:44:28.629
THAT I THINK THIS ONE'S A LITTLE

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:30.263
MORE SIMPLISTIC AS YOU KNOW

01:44:30.330 --> 01:44:30.897
BECAUSE IT'S- PUBLIC DOLLARS I

01:44:30.964 --> 01:44:32.566
THINK. THAT ELEVATES. THE

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:34.434
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TAXPAYERS

01:44:34.501 --> 01:44:35.602
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE-

01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:37.838
SPENDING OUR MONEY WISELY AND

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:39.006
NOT YOU KNOW USING YOUR MONEY TO

01:44:39.072 --> 01:44:41.341
PAY. POVERTY WAGES AND AS YOU

01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:44.144
NOTED- HAVE CONTRACTORS THAT YOU

01:44:44.211 --> 01:44:47.748

01:44:47.814 --> 01:44:48.649
ALWAYS FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:50.884
SPIRITUAL LAW. SO I'M I'M VERY

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:52.753
OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'LL BE ABLE

01:44:52.819 --> 01:44:54.888

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:57.024

01:44:57.090 --> 01:44:58.992
THAT OUR NEW BUILDING ACROSS THE

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:04.731

01:45:04.798 --> 01:45:05.666

THAT IT'S GONNA GO AND FILL. IT

01:45:12.039 --> 01:45:13.807
BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:14.908
I'M- I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:17.511
THAT I'M I'D BE WILLING TO ALLOW

01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:18.645
