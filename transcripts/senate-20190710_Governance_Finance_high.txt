OUR ALTAMONTE LAND FILLED WAS -- ALMOST AT CAPACITY AND SINCE THEN -- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH MEMBERS HERE ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO ADDRESS THE RECYCLING? CRISIS THAT WE HAVE -- FACING US HERE IN CALIFORNIA I'M HERE TO TESTIFY ON ONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL WHICH EXTENT EXTENDS A SUNSET DATE FOR SALES AND USE TAX EXCLUSION. FOR CERTAIN MANUFACTURERS TO JANUARY TWENTY THIRTY THAT IS ADMINISTERED -- AND CHAIRED BY MY OFFICE THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCE TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY. ON NAME TO KATE.

WASTE I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF TO ADD ON TO THE THE SPECIFIC. BENEFITS OF THE KEEPER PROGRAM ALL TOUCH ON OTHER PARTS OF THE BILL. ON IT CALIFORNIA'S HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL RECYCLING SYSTEM OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND A LOT OF THAT HAS COME FROM OVERSEAS MARKETS BEING ABLE TO TAKE OUR MATERIAL. FURTHER SORT IT MAKE IT INTO A VALUABLE PRODUCT -- WITH WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SAYING THEY NO LONGER WANTED OUR RECYCLABLES. I THAT SET OFF A DOMINO EFFECT ALL OVER SOUTHEAST AND EAST ASIA. WHERE OTHER COUNTRIES -- HAVE ALSO SAID THEY NO LONGER WANT ARM MAKES WASTE MATERIAL. AND AS A RESULT WE NEED CLEANER MATERIALS IN ORDER TO KEEP RECYCLING. AND THE BILL -- HANDLES THAT ANSWER FOR TWO DIFFERENT WAYS OR SAW BY CREATING INCENTIVES FOR MANUFACTURERS. IN CALIFORNIA TO USE RECYCLED CONTENT THROUGH THE CASE FOR PROGRAM. AND THE REVOLVING LOAN PROGRAM AT OUR END EASY. AND BY. REDUCING CONSUMER CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT GOES AND WHAT BEEN. BY GETTING RID OF THE CHASING ARROWS ON PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT RECYCLABLE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A MANDATE THAT ANYTHING PLASTIC MUST HAVE THE CHASING ARROWS. AND EVEN THE MAIN FACTORS ARE NECESSARILY WANT TO PUT THAT ON PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT RECYCLABLE. AND FINALLY CREATES A COMMISSION TO HELP INFORM STATE EDUCATION EFFORTS ON WHAT IS AND ISN'T RECYCLING CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE WE CAN'T. DO ANY KIND OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IF WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW. WHAT SHOULD BE GOING INTO DIFFERENT BANDS? THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE'RE NOT GONNA. WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL FIRST AND LAST NAME AN ORGANIZATION GOOD MORNING SIR GOOD MORNING SIR CHECK HELD ADVERT REPRESENT REPUBLIC SERVICES AND IN SUPPORT OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT. PIECE OF RECYCLING LEGISLATION THANKS RUSSIA HEY GOOD MORNING. MORNING MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING JOHN KENNEDY WITH RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES THE CALIFORNIA STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU DON'T THINK YOU. WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANYONE ELSE IS GONNA BE LAST CALL FOR SUPPORT. MORNING GOOD MORNING TREES THE REGULARS ON THE HAPPY CALIFORNIA COMPOST COALITION IN THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SUPPORT YOUR GOOD IT'S A BUSY DAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. ARE WE NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO THOSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSED IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FOR THIS TIME. GONNA MAKE ROOM FOR MISTER CHARACTER PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE DíAS ONE OF OUR WITNESSES. THANK CARE REPRESENTING THE COMPANY LEAGUE CITIES WE WELCOME TO COMMITTEE IN OPPOSITION FLOORS YOUR SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DAN KERRIGAN BEHALF OF LEE A CALIFORNIA CITIES -- WE CERTAINLY A SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THAT -- THE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE FACING ON RECYCLING -- THE BOTTOM ONE CONCERN FOR US THOUGH IT IS ABOUT YOU KNOW WITH WITH THIS BILL IS -- WHO'S PAYING FOR FOR THE EXTENSION OF THIS KATE FOR PROGRAM -- THIS PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED AT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS YEAR THE SALES AND USE TAX EXCLUSION PROGRAM -- IN IN ONE PROVISION OF THE BILL ACTUALLY EXTENDS ITS PROGRAM FOR TEN YEARS SO THAT'S ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS -- AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS. WHICH IS VERY WELL DONE. ON THE FIRST PAGE I MEAN OUR OUR SALES AND USE TAX ALEC. ALLOCATION IS GETTING PRETTY CHOPPED UP OVER THE YEARS IN TERMS OF WHERE DOLLARS GO. BUT IS IT GIVES YOU CAN TELL THE THE STATE GENERAL FUNDS IMPACT IS THREE POINT 93%. ALL THE OTHER IMPACTS OF A SALES AND USE TAX EXCLUSION OF FALL ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND ACTUALLY BELOW THE LINE IF YOU LOOK ON THE FIRST PAGE SEVEN POINT 25% YOU HAVE LOCAL TRANSFER TRANSPORTATION TAX MEASURES OTHER LOCAL TRANSACTION USE TAX MEASURES THAT APPROVED BY LOCAL VOTERS. SO WHEN YOU EXCLUDE AVENUE THE SALES TAX AND USE TAX EXCLUSION. THERE'S A LOT OF IMPACTS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE SECOND THING IN THIS ANALYSIS THAT I WANT YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU -- FOCUS ON IS WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT STATE REVENUE IMPACT -- IT COULD BE GIVEN THAT. MANY OF THESE -- OF THESE INVESTMENTS COULD COULD CURRENTLY QUALIFY FOR THE MANUFACTURERS EXEMPTION THAT WAS EXTENDED A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THE REVENUE IMPACT -- FOR THE STATE OF FOR THIS BILLION DOLLAR ON EXTENSION IS UNDER TEN MILLION PER YEAR. AND THEN ON COMMENT NUMBER FIVE IT IT IT DOES OUTLINE THAT. MOST OF THE IMPACT OF EXTENDING THIS PROGRAM -- UP TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FALLS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO ON WE DON'T LET'S A LOT OF MONEY. AND SO WE DO HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH -- THAT KIND OF REVENUE IMPACT OF WITH THIS PROGRAM -- THE OTHER THING. THAT IS -- CHALLENGING WITH -- THIS PROGRAM FROM ALL OVER A TAX PERSPECTIVE IS. THE OFTENTIMES WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THERE IS A NEXUS BETWEEN WHERE THE THE COMMUTERS THAT'S GETTING THE BENEFIT OF THE INVESTMENT AND THEN WERE THE TAX DOLLARS ARE COMING FROM. UNDER THIS PROGRAM FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE. CITY A MAY BE GETTING THE NEW INVESTMENT BUT CITIES B. C. AND D. OR THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY ARE PAYING FOR IT SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH. THE EXTENSION OF THAT PROGRAM. HE'S MUCH AS CHARACTERS CARE WERE HAVE YOU HANG THERE FOR WITH US I JUST CASE ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA GO TO THOSE. WHO MAY STILL BE IN OPPOSITION THEY WERE IN TURN OVER THE SILLY WOMAN TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME COMMENTS? THANK YOU VERY SEE THIS IS GOING TO BE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD THIS TIME. WHERE DO LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION? THANK YOU SO MUCH CAN AS THE SERGEANTS MAKER MIKE'S WITNESSES MIKE'S IN THESE ARE JUST A LITTLE LOW BUT IF. WE CHECK IT OUT IN WILL TURN OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN I TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND THEN WE'LL% OPEN IT UP. FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE NOW IT MADAM SOME NUMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANNA AND I WILL ALSO. MAKE TIME. FOR OUR OUR WITNESSES TO SPEAK UP BUT I WILL SAY AS AT LIKE LIKE LIKE THAT THE OUR STATE TREASURER I ALSO CAME FROM WILL LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I WHEN YOU GO WORK FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND YOU ARE AT ELECTED OFFICIAL ON A CITY OR A COUNTY -- YOU KNOW FROM THE GROUND UP THE PROBLEM OF TRASH AND RECYCLING IN BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR CITIES NEEDS -- ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIVE IN AREAS WITH A LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC PROFILE. AND WHILE ANY KIND OF DIVERSION OF TAX DOLLARS WE UNDERSTAND IS -- IS IMPORTANT -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE CARE IT TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP. THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THINGS WITH OUR TRASH MAKE THINGS WITH OUR WAYS TO TURN THOSE INTO GOOD MANUFACTURING JOBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MORE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. WORK TO REDUCE OUR WASTE THEN THAT WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING -- SO WHILE CITIES AB AND C. MAY NOT GET THE ACTUAL BENEFIT I WOULD BUT I WOULD BET YOU THAT THEY ARE WE REAPING THE BENEFIT BY THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING ABLE TO REDUCE. THE AMOUNT WE'RE PUTTING INTO OUR LANDFILLS AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MANUFACTURING JOBS THAT WE'RE CREATING AS WE CREATE OUR OWN CLOSE SYSTEM CYCLE. AND I DO WANT TO ADD THAT ON THIS PROGRAM IS WORKING IT IS WORKING TO KEEP JOBS HERE TO BRING A CERTAIN COMPANIES -- WITH TECHNOLOGY TO MEET OUR A. B. THIRTY TWO MANDATES AND ALL THE OTHER -- MANDATES THAT WE HAVE BEEN APPROVING HERE SO JUST WANNA GIVE A COUPLE OF STATISTICS AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN KATE HAD APPROVED A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED ONE PROJECT APPLICATIONS HELPING TO PURCHASE OVER EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IN EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY -- THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE ACTIVE INCOMPLETE PROJECTS THAT WERE APPROVED FOR A TOTAL OF SIX POINT. TWO FIVE BILLION IN ANTICIPATED QUALIFIED PROPERTY PURCHASE IS ESTIMATED TO RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR MILLION IN STATE TAX EXEMPTIONS. THESE PROJECTS ARE LOCATED ACROSS THIRTY THREE COUNTIES THEIR ESTIMATED TO RESULT IN THE RETENTION AND CREATION OF FORTY FIVE THOUSAND JOBS. WITH TWENTY TWO HUNDRED OF THESE JOBS IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO THIS STATE TAX EXEMPTION PROGRAM -- SO IT IS WORKING -- WE HAVE FUNDED PROJECTS IN ALL OF THE DISTRICTS -- NOT ALL OF THEM ARE RELATED TO ONE COUNTY -- AS WE ALL KNOW WASTE IS A STATE WIDE -- ISSUE WE HAVE AN INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT BOARD SPECIFICALLY TO EQUALIZE WHERE ALL OF OUR TRASH GOES TO AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY -- TO CREATE WHAT WE CREATE WHERE EVERYBODY'S TRASH GOES TO TO SHOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS AND OTHER ISSUES -- SHOULD BE A STATEWIDE. PROBLEM IN WITH SOLUTIONS AND NOT JUST A COUNTY BY COUNTY -- SOLUTION SO I APPRECIATE -- THE TIME HERE BUT THIS PROGRAM IS WORKING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM TREASURE LET'S OPEN UP THE COMMITTEES IF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THIS IS A VICE CHAIR. THERE SEEMS TO BE YOU INEQUITIES IN SALES TAX LAW. AMAZON WAREHOUSES IN CERTAIN CITIES. BUT YOU HAVE A AMENDMENT THAT YOU WOULD PROPOSE LIKE THAT THAT THE STATE REIMBURSES YOU YOU'RE ONE PERCENTER. WELL THAT WOULD BE A GOOD AMENDMENT. TO OUT WE GET IT -- BUT IT'S IT'S A HARD ONE WHAT'S REALLY CHALLENGING ON SENATOR WITH THE BILL IS. AGAIN -- IT TO THE EXTENT THERE'S A LOCAL REVENUE IMPACT -- AGE I THINK THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THAT WAS RECEIVING THE INVESTMENT THE JOBS ANOTHER DOG DIRECT BENEFITS TO THE EXTENT THERE WAS A CLOSER NEXUS. AND THE BENEFIT OF THE AND I THINK IT MIGHT BE MORE WORKABLE IT'S PRETTY HARD -- THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS IS A MANUFACTURER WILL HAVE A LIST OF THINGS. THAT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO USE FOR FOR FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE PROJECT AND THE AND IT'S UP TO THE MANUFACTURER IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY BY THOSE PRODUCTS SO. THE THE THE TAX THE IMPACT OF THE TAX REDUCTION IS COULD BE SPREAD ALL VER THE PLACE WHERE THE IF YOU LOOK IN THIS IN THIS ANALYSIS IT TALKS ABOUT TESLA GETTING A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAM. WILL CLEARLY SAID THE CITY OF FREMONT IS BENEFITING A LOT FROM THOSE THOSE INVESTMENTS IN THOSE DOLLARS THE QUESTION IS WHERE. WE'RE OR THE LOCAL TAX CONTRIBUTIONS COMING FROM. IT'S VERY HARD IN THIS PROGRAM TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESTRUCTURING SO THERE'S A CLOSER NEXUS BETWEEN -- THE CONTRIBUTORS AND AND THE BENEFIT. SO WE HAVE A BIG ISSUES THEN TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPROVE. SALES AND USE TAX BECAUSE WE'VE GOT CITIES AND GETTING GOBS OF SALES TAX BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE WAREHOUSES AND THE CITIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY PURCHASING THE GOODS ARE GETTING THE BENEFIT EITHER SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE FIX THE SYSTEM. WHO ARE GONNA BE DONE IN THIS BILL? THE COMMITTEE DID -- SUPPORT BY SENATOR GLAZERS BILL EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT ADDRESSES THAT IN OUR OPINION AT LEAST SOME OF THE THE ISSUES WITH THE WAREHOUSES. AND WE SUPPORT THAT BILL. THE COMMISSION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT TO BE TURNED OVER TO THE MINISTRY TO THE PROGRAMS CARILLO TO BE IN THAT PROVIDE TO US -- COMMENTARY ON THE PROGRAM IN THE DETAILS OF IT PLEASE THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THAT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST ADD A LITTLE CLARITY -- THIS IS NOT A BROADLY PULL THE MIKE CLOSER I'M SURE THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN -- THIS IS DINA CARILLO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR KEEP THAT -- TED TO CORRECT AT A FEW ISSUES THIS IS NOT A BROAD ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM THIS IS A PROGRAM WHERE SPECIFIC RECYCLERS MANUFACTURERS CAN COME IN AND WE ASSESS THE NET BENEFIT WHETHER THE FISCAL. BENEFIT OF THE PROJECT WILL OUTWEIGH THE FOR GONE SALES AND USE TAX IN DOING THAT WE LOOK AT EMPLOYEES SALARIES INCREASES IN PROPERTY TAX -- I AM -- SYMPATHETIC TO THE ISSUE RAISED BY THE CITIES AND THE TAX RATE I WOULD SAY THAT THIS PROGRAM IS A DIFFERENT. IN THE SENSE THAT THIS IS A POTENTIALLY A ONE TIME LOSS THAT IS NOTED. IN THE STAFF REPORTS WHAT'S NOT NOTED AS A LONG TERM FISCAL BENEFIT OF THE JOBS -- THE INCREASE PROPERTY TAXES OVER TIME EVEN IN THOSE SUPPLIER ENTITIES LOTS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE EXCITED TO BE THOSE SUPPLIER CLUSTERS PROTEST Là -- BECAUSE THEY WILL GROW IN THEIR OWN REGIONS AND CREATE REGIONAL CLUSTERS THAT CREATE LONG TERM JOBS -- MINUS ONE DOLLAR LOSS OF THE GENERAL FUND OF THAT YEAR I'M INCREASING PROPERTY TAX I WOULD SAY IN A OVERALL IMPACT. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT DISTINCT DIFFERENCE AND ALSO CLARIFY THAT AS A RECYCLING CHALLENGES HAVE BECOME GREATER WE NEED GREATER TECHNOLOGY -- FOR THE ORGANICS WASTE TO CREATE THE BIO FUEL TIM TO DIVERT FROM LANDFILLS AND I'VE HEARD FROM THESE COMPANIES THAT THAT -- STATE LOCAL IMPACT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE WELL THERE IS A REFERENCE TO THE LA A REPORT ABOUT BEING SOMEWHERE PROGRAMS WE HAVE REALLY SEEN THAT THAT THIS PROGRAM CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE IN A PROJECT MOVING FORWARD OR NOT. AND MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CITIES APPLY -- BECAUSE THE THE THE DYNAMICS AND THE ECONOMICS OF EACH OF EACH PROJECT IS IS THAT WHEN WHEN IT COMES TO MEETING CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSION RIGHT. YOU SO MUCH MISS KOREA. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS UP FROM THE COMMITTEE. THEN WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND THEN AND AND A GREAT RESPECT TO THIS IN THE WOMAN THE TREASURE OF BE OKAY WE LIKE TO BE TO TAKE UP THE CONSENT COUNTER BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GET A BILL OVER TO HEALTH.

IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE PASSED AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE THAT ALLOCATED A FEE THAT WAS ALREADY IMPOSED ON CAR BATTERIES TO FUND THE CLEANUP CONTAMINATION CAUSED BY LEAD ACID BATTERIES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE THIS BILL IS CREATED IN RESPONSE TO THE MAN MADE ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER EXCITED. IN MY BACKYARD. AB ONE FORTY TWO ADDRESSES TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION BUT I BUY THE CD TFA. IT ALSO THAT'S A PROCESS FOR THIS CD TFA TO BETTER TRACK THE EXEMPTIONS. UNDER CURRENT LAW AT THE POINT OF SALE ONE DOLLAR FROM THE CONSUMERS DEPOSIT WILL GO TO THE CLEAN UP FINE. MANY FACTORS ALSO PAY A ONE DOLLAR FEE ON ALL BATTERY SOLD IN THIS STATE. THIRTEEN ABLE TWENTY SECOND THE CONSUMER FEE INCREASES TO TWO DOLLAR. AND THE MANUFACTURE FEE SENSE IT. THIS BILL SIMPLY STARTS TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP EQUITY BETWEEN THE CONSUMER AND THE MANUFACTURERS AND SETS THE MANUFACTURE OF THE EQUAL TO THE CONSUMER FEE. WE NEED AS MANY NIGHTS AS THE CLEANUP BACKSIDE BUT ALL THE OTHERS MOTHERS IN THE STATE WE KNOW OF AT LEAST FIFTEEN OTHER SMELTERS WE HAVE ONE HERE IN WITH. SACRAMENTO WE HAVE ONE IN ALAMEDA WE HAVE NUMEROUS AN ALLEY COUNTY THIS PHONE WOULD HELP CLEAN UP ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT SITES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

AND THAT'S TRUE OKAY -- HERE IS SEEN NO ONE ELSE -- IN SUPPORT WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF ANYONE IS OPPOSED OR OPPOSED TO DAD JOKES SO -- MISTER CHAIRMAN -- HEY MISTER WOLF I'M EXCITED TO SEE IS THERE HI ALL RIGHT COULD YOU SEE I'M I'M VERY AMPED UP TODAY WOULD YOU -- JESUS IS GOING TO ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY TIMES VISIBLE THE FLOORS SO I ALWAYS HAVE PLANS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SIR THE FOR SERVICE AS THANK YOU MEMBERS GOOD MORNING-DAVID WILL FOR THE OUR JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION -- WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL -- MEMBERS SO TOUGH ONE FOR US BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE DO UNDERSTAND -- WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE EXCITED YOU KNOW BATTERY PLAN IN THE CITY OF VERNON AND THE ISSUES THERE AND -- AND OBVIOUSLY CLEAN UP OF THAT FACILITY IS VERY EXPENSIVE LOOKING AT UPWARDS OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CLEAN. YOU KNOW THE LEAD CONTAMINATED UNDERSTAND THAT. HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER IMPACT THAT -- THIS BILL BRINGS FORWARD YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF AGAIN CALIFORNIANS THE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS OUT OF THE BUDGET THAT WAS JUST PASSED. AND AND AND YOU KNOW IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING YOU KNOW EVEN AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED THAT WE'VE NOW GONE FROM THE CITY OF EXCITED TO YOU EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT BATTERY FACILITIES. UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND IF THIS IS A PROBLEM MEMBERS STATEWIDE SHOULD THIS NOT BE FUNDED OUT OF THE STATE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER OF STATEWIDE CONCERN. AND WE SHOULDN'T BE FOISTING ADDITIONAL FEES ON CONSUMERS THAT MIGHTNOT HAVE BATTERY PLANTS IN THEIR GIVEN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS SO REALLY FOR US IT'S A QUESTION NOT SO MUCH OF THE FEE INCREASES JUST EQUITY IN GENERAL. FOR THOSE REASONS ASK FOR NOVA. MR WILL FORGIVE YOU HANG HERE JUST IN CASE THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T MIND WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP TO ANYONE% ELSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSED IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADVANCE. LOOKING FOR OPPOSITION. WE'RE GONNA DO LAST CALL. TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE DO HAVE A MOTION A MOTION ON THE FLOOR BY CENTER TITLE IS VICE CHAIR [inaudible] FOR MR -- IT ALWAYS SEEMS THAT -- WHEN WE GET A YEAR TAX INCREASE IT TO IT'S A BIG ONE IT'S IS UNDER PERCENT ALTHOUGH JUST A DOLLAR? AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING -- USING THE ARGUMENT IS WELL WE HAVEN'T RAISED IT IN A LONG TIME THEREFORE WE GOT A REALLY CATCH UP. IS THERE A WAY TO MAYBE MODIFY THE BILL TO DO IT INCREMENTALLY OVER TIME. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF WE ALLOW THE FEE TO BE AT THE RATE AT WHICH IS COMING IN. WE WOULD HAVE -- OVER THIRTY YEARS BEFORE WE COULD FINISH THE CLEANUP AND SO WE CONTINUE TO PUT PEOPLE ARE ASSN THE HEALTH AT RISK.

GOOD MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS CAROLING OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURER'S AND TAX COLLECTORS. WE ARE OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED -- ARE CONCERNED STEM FROM THE USE OF THE PROGRAM BY MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY CAN ALL USE AT ONE TIME WERE CONCERNED THAT THE USE OF THE WORD HOUSEMAN'S LEAN PROCESS WHEREBY. AN ABANDONED MOBILE HOME IS SOLD AT AN AUCTION FOR DOLLAR. TO A PARK OWNER AND THEN THEY ARE ABLE TO THEN APPLY TO THIS PROGRAM AND WIPES AWAY. THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF PROPERTY TAXES THAT ARE OWED. TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WERE CONCERNED THAT PARKING OR CERTAINLY KNOW HOW TO TRANSFER THE THE PAPERWORK PROPERLY. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME -- LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANCE IN MAKING SURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS SERVING THE POPULATION AS INTENDED THE SUPPORTERS HERE THAT'S GREAT WEIRD THAT THOSE ARE THE FOLKS WE WANT TO HELP. WE OFFERED SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS TO THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL I AND I TWENTY SIXTEEN WE PROVIDED A LOT OF COMMENTATORS CITIES THEY DEVELOP THE REGULATIONS. NONE OF OUR SUGGESTIONS WERE INCORPORATED WHICH IS WHY WE ARE NOW HERE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE WE ARE WATCHING PARKOWNERS USE THIS TO ENRICH THEMSELVES. AND ACQUIRE SOMEONE'S FORMER HOME FOR A DOLLAR IN THE MIDDLE OF A HOUSING CRISIS SO I WE'RE ASKING FOR YOU TO EXERCISE THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT ROLE THAT YOU DO ENJOY BY LOOKING AT THESE FOR THE WAREHOUSE MEANS LEAD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT PEOPLE ARE USING THEM. THE PROGRAM AND NOT A RICH IN THEMSELVES AND THROUGH THIS THROUGH THIS PROGRAM AND ALSO WE OBSERVE TO THAT IT'S COST I% THINK IT'S TO BE ABOUT A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TO RUN THE PROGRAM THEY'VE ONLY BROUGHT IN TWO HUNDRED AND SOMETHING THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEES AS OF JANUARY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN OR LOCAL PROPERTY TAX DOLLARS SO WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING TO FORFEIT THIS ON VOLUNTARILY -- WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ACTUAL INTENDED RECIPIENTS OF THE BILL ARE THERE ARE THE BENEFICIARIES. AND THEN -- WE ALSO WANT TO OBSERVE THAT THIS DOES NOT ACTUALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE'S HOMES ARE REGISTERED THERE'S STILL NO LONG TERM SOLUTION IN THE BILL IT OPENS A WINDOW THAT FOLKS CAN GO THROUGH TO GET THEIR TECH CSUS FORGIVEN. AND THERE'S NO LONG TERM SOLUTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PARK OWNERS KNOW WHEN THE MOBILE HOME IS REGISTERED CURRENT OR NOT SO UNTIL THE STICKER PROGRAM IS BROUGHT BACK. YOU REALLY HAVEN'T SOLVED THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE GIVING AWAY A LOT OF PROPERTY TAX DOLLARS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE OPPOSED. I WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION OVER THE BREAK THE AUTHORS OFFICE HAS REACHED OUT AND WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SAYING WE'RE GONNA BE HANG THERE IF THAT'S OKAY JUST IN CASE YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE. WHO MAY BE IN? OPPOSITION OF THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD. THIS CAN BE LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A MOTION A MOTION BY SENATOR BELL THIS IS A DO PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS. TO MEMBER CHAD YOU WERE A RESPOND TO MISS LANE'S COMMENTS PLEASE ABSOLUTELY -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR THE QUESTIONS LET ME IN ANY -- ADDRESS IT FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES ON THE FIRST OF ALL I THINK THE THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS -- OF OF THIS BILL IS TO HELP. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOMEOWNERS ARE GET TO TRANSFER THE TITLE PROPERLY -- AND YOU KNOW WITHOUT PAYING TAXES THAT THEY DID NOT A CREW. NOW UNDER THIS PROGRAM THE COUNTY SO STILL ELIGIBLE TO PURSUE ANY BACK -- DELINQUENT TAXES -- IF THEY WISH SO WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY LOSING ANY PARTICULAR BACK TAXES BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE LAW DOESN'T PROHIBITIVE FROM GOING AFTER THESE BAD BAD GUYS. NOW HAVING SAID THAT -- YOU KNOW IS A PART OWNER IS A LEGITIMATE OWNER OF THE UNIT FOR EXAMPLE A HE OR SHE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO OF THE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. NOW AS TO THE POTENTIAL MISUSE OF THE PROGRAM. I THINK THAT -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- MANY OF THE PARK OWNERS WORK SIMPLY HOPING RESIDENTS TO OF FILL OUT FORMS AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE OF THEIR LIMITED. ENGLISH SKILL LEVEL THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO SO SO THEY WERE SIMPLY TRYING TO YOU KNOW FILLED THE FORMS WITH MS AND IN THE TRANSFER THE TITLE BACK TO THE PROPER OWNER. NOW. IS THE PROGRAM IS MIS USE ALL THE FIRST ONE TO ME I'LL TRY TO FIX IT. SO I AM A VERY WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH THE COUNTY SUBSTANCE FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE AS TO THE OUTSTANDING AMENDMENTS OF SUGGESTED I THINK. THEY POSE CERTAIN OF PROBLEMS BOB SO -- I'LL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM BUT I JUST WANT TO ALSO POINT OUT THE FACT THAT EXISTING LAW MAKES IT A FELONY FOR SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE INTENT TO DEFRAUD THE SYSTEM. BY A TRANSFER TITLE IMPROPERLY AND THAT'S ON THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE -- ARTICLE SEVEN ONE EIGHT ONE TWO FOUR POINT FIVE SO -- SO THE LAW IS AVAILABLE -- FORCE TO PURSUE ANY -- BAD ACTORS YOU KNOW FOR SOMEBODY WHO MISUSES A THE PROGRAM SO. WITH THAT I YOU KNOW I I BELIEVE THAT MY MEETING WITH THE OPPOSITION IS -- SET FOR THIS AFTERNOON SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM. AND YOU KNOW CLOSE ANY POTENTIAL OPPOSE AT THIS PROGRAM TO CREATE SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A MEMBER I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT KNOW THAT THIS IS A ONE YEAR EXTENSION. IN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS HERE OVER THE SUMMER DURING SUMMER WORK PERIOD BUT THEN THIS ONE YEAR EXTENSION IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW.

THIS IS FOCUSING ON DRINKING WATER IN CONSOLIDATION. AND EXTENSION OF SERVICE. THE MEMBER THE FLOOR IS YOURS ON AB FIVE OH EIGHT WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS AND I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB FIVE ZERO EIGHT WHICH BUILT ON OUR PROGRESS LAST YEAR. TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO INDIVIDUALS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WHO RELY ON SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND DOMESTIC WHIRLS. SPECIFICALLY AB FIVE ZERO EIGHT REQUIRED THE WATER BOARD TO LET RATE PAYERS RENTERS AND LAND OWNERS. IN THE DISTURBANCES COMMUNITY KNOWS ABOUT WATER QUALITY CONCERN IN THE AREA. INFORMATION ABOUT THE HELL SHE OF CONTAMINANTS AND TO INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CONSOLE OF THE OR EXTENSION ALL SERVICES. THIS FOR A ALSO CLARIFIED THAT AS A STATE MANDATED CONSOLIDATION OR EXTENSION. THE BIG GAINS IT IS A VIOLATION OF THE LAW FOR A RECEIVING WATER SYSTEM TO OVER CHARGE BEYOND A REASONABLE COST. TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. FINALLY THIS WILL SET THE DOWNLINE THE DEADLINE FOR JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHICH TO STAY WATER BOARD. WILL DEVELOP AND ADOPT A POLICY FOR MEMBERS OFF TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY TO PETITION. THE WATER BOARD TO CONSOLIDATION OR EXTENSION OFFICE SERVICES. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND SUPPORTER OF BY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS. THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. AND HAS NO OPPOSITION. WHO WAS ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS FROM MICHAEL CLAIR BORN PHONE THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE? AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALSO -- SASHA SEARCHERS HERE'S ARCHER HARDEN FROM THE WESTERN CENTER OF LAW AND PROPERTY. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE HAVE. BILL WE HAVE A TWO WITNESSES SO I JUST WANNA CONFIRM WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO FIRST. I THINK I'LL START ALL RIGHT HEY WELCOME YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES OF YOUR MIND IS INTRODUCE YOURSELF FIRST LAST ORGANIZATION TWO MINUTES WELCOME SIR ABSOLUTELY -- MY NAME'S MICHAEL CLAIBORNE I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WHICH IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NONPROFIT BASED IN FRESNO -- AND WITH OFFICES IN THESE COACHELLA VALLEY AS WELL. I'LL START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR PAST AND PRESENT EFFORTS TO CHAMPION PAUL -- POLICY TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND I'LL ALSO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE SENATOR HER HER TAUGHT -- FOR SECURING AN APPROPRIATION FOR EXTENSION OF DRINKING WATER SERVICE TO TOMBSTONE TERRITORY AND FRESNO COUNTY IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AND I MENTION THIS PROJECT HERE BECAUSE IT IS THROUGH OUR EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS IN TOMBSTONE WHICH STRUGGLES WITH ONE TWO THREE T. C. P. NITRATES AND BACTERIA CONTAMINATION. THAT WE IDENTIFIED WITH THE AUTHOR IMPROVEMENTS THE PROCESS FOR DRINKING WATER CONSOLIDATION -- WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN AB FIVE AWAIT. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT. TURNING TO THE NEED FOR THE BILL THERE'S A DRINKING WATER CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE CURRENTLY LACK ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THEIR HOMES AND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS PROBLEM IS -- HOUSEHOLDS SERVED BY DOMESTIC WELLS WHICH SERVE TWO MILLION PEOPLE WITHIN THE STATE. THIS IS BEEN MADE TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS SPURRED ON BY THE TRANSFER OF THE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM TO THE STATE WATER BOARD AND THE PASSAGE OF SB. EIGHTY EIGHT AND AB TWENTY FIVE A ONE WHICH GRANTED AN EXPANDED RESPECTIVELY THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE WATER BOARD TO MANDATE DRINKING WATER CONSOLIDATION. AND AB FIVE OH EIGHT CONTINUES AND BUILDS UPON THIS PROGRESS BY MAKING THE MANDATORY CONSOLIDATION PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT AND TRANSPARENT. IT WILL PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO COMMUNITY RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OF EXPAND AS EXTENDING DRINKING WATER SERVICE. THIS INFORMATION INCLUDES NOTICE OF DRINKING WATER PROBLEM PROBLEMS IN THE AREA RELATED HEALTH RISKS AND AVAILABLE SOLUTIONS. IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE FOR THE COMPLETION OF A FEASIBILITY STUDY EARLIER ON IN THE PROCESS WITHOUT THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD IS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED MAJORITY SUPPORT. OFTEN THIS FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS IS REQUIRED IN ADVANCE FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO CONSENT TO DRINKING WATER SERVICE. SO JUST FLIPS THAT PROCESS AROUND IT MAKES A LITTLE MORE SENSE. BY MAKING DRINKING WATER CONSOLIDATION MORE EFFICIENT AND TRANSPARENT PASSAGE OF AB FIVE AWAY WILL SUPPORT EFFECTIVE PROCESSES TO ENSURE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS WATER IS REALIZED FOR ALL CALIFORNIA FOUND FAMILIES. AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT THANK YOU MICHAEL THANKS FOR BEING HERE WE'RE GRATEFUL. QUESTION GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD MORNING SUTTER HER NAME HOUSING POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. WE ARE THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO RECOGNIZE THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER AND WE'VE IT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND RENTAL HOUSING THROUGH -- HABITABILITY LAWS -- WHEN THE LOW INCOME FAMILIES THAT WE REPRESENT LACK SAFE DRINKING WATER LACK INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN DRINK OR BATHE WITH THEIR WATER -- IT CAN LEADS NOT ONLY ALSO TO HOMELESSNESS JOBLESSNESS ACADEMIC HARDSHIP. AND THREATS TO FAMILY AND COMMUNITY COHESION. WE'VE SEEN CLIENTS DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES DUE TO A LACK OF ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AND WE'VE SEEN FAMILIES STRUGGLE WITH A LACK OF INFORMATION. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE WATER SAFE TO DRINK OR BATHE WITH -- OR WHAT STEPS THEY CAN DO. TO REGAIN ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER THEY MAY CHOOSE TO BUY COSTLY BOTTLED WATER. TAKE WHATEVER MEASURES THEY CAN COME UP WITH TO PROTECT THEMSELVES OR POTENTIALLY IF THEIR HOMES OUT OF FEAR AND FRUSTRATION. THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT AND CONCRETE HARDSHIPS FOR THE FAMILIES WE REPRESENT GIVING CALIFORNIA'S HIGH RATE OF POVERTY AND LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- FOR EXAMPLE I WORKED WITH RESIDENTES EN LOS ANGELES STRUGGLING WITH DISCOLORED WATER AND NOT REALLY KNOWING WHERE THAT PROBLEM IS COMING FROM. MANY OF THEM WEREN'T BOILING IT BECAUSE THEY HAD PAST EXPERIENCES WITH BACTERIAL CONTAMINANTS -- AND KNEW THAT WAS A WAY TO TREAT THAT WATER -- BUT BECAUSE THIS WATER WAS CONTAMINATED WITH LEAD THAT CAN ACTUALLY CONCENTRATE THAT CONTAMINANT AND SUBJECT FAMILIES TO HIGHER RISKS -- SO INFORMATION REGARDING LOCAL WATER QUALITY WILL BETTER EQUIP DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO MAKE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS -- AND INFORMATION REGARDING RIGHTS AND OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO CONSOLIDATION WILL EMPOWER THEM TO ADVOCATE FOR SOLUTIONS AND BETTER PROTECT THEIR HOMES AND FAMILIES WE ARE TO SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH ON BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO ANYONE. ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT FIRST CLASS ORGANIZATION GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MATTHEW BIGGER PLANNING CONSERVATION THE INSTRUCTOR PUTTING COMMITTEE WELCOME BACK.

WE'RE GONNA DO A LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION. CURRENCY NUMBER NOW WOULD LIKE TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE THE TURN IT OVER THE VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER. WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A SAFE DRINKING WATER CONCERNED I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROCESS I WHAT WHY? WHY ARE WE OVERLAPPING -- MAY BE MOVING INTO THE TERRITORY OF LAUGHTER. YOU MIGHT I DON'T HAVE THE BUT EVERY EVERY CREATING A TERRITORY -- FOR HERE OR ARE WE REMAIN BEING CHARMING. I I'M JUST CURIOUS. NO SENATOR NOTICES JUST TO INFORM THE LANDLORD TENANT. AND IN THE DISTRICT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. ABOUT THEIR WATER QUALITIES AND PROVIDE A WAY. FOR THEM -- TO PETITION FOR CONSOLIDATION OR EXTENSION OF WATERS. IT DOES NOT AFTER THE LAUGHTER PROCESS THAN. I DON'T THINK A NEW MALL TO LAUGH CO PRODUCE. BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT INCORPORATING. IS THE USE OF LAND WERE JUST TALKING TO VOTE PROVIDING. WATER. LARA CONSOLIDATE A SMALL WATER SYSTEM IF THERE'S A OF OF A LARGER WATER SYSTEM NEARBY THEY CAN PROVIDE BETTER QUALITY OF WATER WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SO THAT'S USUALLY JUST ALL WHEN HE OF THE LAUGHTER -- SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE MY CONFUSION IS MISTER CHURCH WHAT AM I MISSING IT IS TO LOOK AT THE WAY IT WILL WORK AND I'LL JUST I'LL PARAPHRASE IT HERE IS THAT -- PREVIOUS LEGISLATION ALLOW THE STATE WATER BOARD TO BE ABLE TO-CONSOLIDATE CONSOLIDATE SMALLER DISTRICTS BECAUSE ALL THE DISTRICTS THAT HAD CHALLENGES WITH WATER QUALITY EXCEPT WE SAW. I SEVERAL WATER DISTRICTS IN MY COUNTY THAT AFTER THE FIRES. HI THE ULTIMATE DECISION. THE WATER BOARD HAS THE AUTHORITY BUT LAST GOAL HAS TO PROVE AT THE VERY END OF THE PROCESS THERE IS SOME -- INVOLVEMENT AT THE END OF THE PROCESS -- SO LAUGHTER WOULD STILL TOUCH THAT -- AT THE END OF THE PROCESS WITH THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE WATER BOARD.

EIGHT FORTY NINE THANK YOU COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE BILL TO WORK ON THE BILL APPRECIATED. REDISTRICTING IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE TO LOCAL DEMOCRACY HOW CITY OR COUNTY ELECTION DISTRICTS ARE DRAWN CAN HELP DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A COMMUNITY WILL BE FAIRLY. REPRESENTED BY THE MOST INTIMATE AND PROXIMATE GOVERNMENT BODIES UNLIKE STATE LEVEL REDISTRICTING THERE ARE VERY FEW REQUIREMENTS GOVERNING CITY. AND COUNTY REDISTRICTING TO ENSURE THE PROCESS IS FAIR AND TRANSPARENT AND THAT THE PUBLIC AND ESPECIALLY UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ARE ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS AB. EIGHT FORTY NINE WILL BRING TRANSPARENCY AND CREATE CLEAR STANDARDS FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES BY EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OTHERWISE ALL TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED THIS BILL ENSURES THAT RDISTRICTING MAPS. ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC BEFORE THEY CAN BE ADOPTED AND ALONG WITH OTHER TRANSPARENCY MEASURES SETS A MINIMUM OF FOUR PUBLIC HEARINGS TO ALLOW FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION WITH THE RECENT AMENDMENTS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE STAKEHOLDERS FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT AND DIALOGUE REGARDING AB EIGHT FORTY NINE I BELIEVE HE STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. I WITH THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATORS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH ME HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT. ARE NICHOLAS HARD OR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR COMMON CAUSE CALIFORNIA AND DOOR ROSE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS CALIFORNIA. YOU SO MUCH AND BEFORE WE GO TO OUR WITNESSES I DO APOLOGIZE BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE ANOTHER BONTA DEAL THAT WE HAVE TO GET OVER TO HEALTH -- A AND IT IS ON CONSENT IN HEALTH IS PAYING IN US -- AND WE NEED TO GET ONE ADDITIONAL MEMBER ON SO -- IF IT WORKS YOU MISTER CINNAMON WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CALL -- ABSENT MEMBERS AND CAN SING COUNTER PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISS INTERESTED BELL. THERE ARE. IT IS A SEVEN ZERO WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT BILL OVER TO HEALTH. HERE A. S. A. P. THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT I CONSIDER HOW UNDER IS OUT AND WE'RE CLOSED ON THE ROLE ON THE CONSENT COUNTER WITH A SEVEN ZERO VOTE. WHO'D LIKE TO BE A KICK **** OFF -- THANK YOU SO MUCH NICOLAS WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO YOU YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES SIR. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS NICHOLS HAD ON REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE WE'RE PROUD CO SPONSOR AB EIGHT FOUR NINE WHICH PROVIDES A CRUCIAL SAFETY NET. AGAINST GERRYMANDERING AND CITY AND COUNTY REDISTRICTING FERRY DISSING IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT INJURY REPRESENTATIVE AND INCLUSIVE DEMOCRACY. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO A GOOD JOB OF REDUCING UNFORTUNATELY WE SOMETIMES SEE LOCAL REDUCING PROCESS ABUSED THE WAY THAT UNDERMINE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY BY CRACKING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES BE A RULE COMMUNITIES WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES. OR MINORITY COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT DILUTES THE POWER OF THEIR VOTE -- AND UNDERMINES LOCAL POLITICAL KIND BUILDING. THIS ISN'T SIGNIFICANT PART BECAUSE UNLIKE LISTING CONGRESSIONAL REDUCING THEIR ALMOST NO MANDATORY STANDARDS TO GUIDE LOCAL REDUCING TO PREVENT SUCH ABUSE. AND TO ENSURE DIVERSE PARTICIPATION THE PROCESS OF FOR EXAMPLE UNLIKE PRISTINE CONGRESSIONAL REDUCING THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR LOCRI DESTROYING. THE COMMUNITIES NEIGHBORHOODS BE KEPT HOLD -- AND WHERE IS THE STATE COMMISSION MUST ENGAGE IN EXTENSIVE -- HEARING PROCESS STATE LAW REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOLD JUST ONE PUBLIC HEARING. DARTING MAPS AND HAS NO PUBLIC I REACH REQUIREMENTS AS A RESULT MANY COMMUNITIES AND SOCIALLY NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES FILL TO PARTICIPATE LOW REDUCING PROCESS. MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT ITS CURRENT THESE ARE OFTEN I MIGHT AT THE SAME CONSTITUENCIES THAT ARE OFTEN STARKLY AND REPRESENTED AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AB FOUR NINE JUST PROVIDES POLICY GARTNER GIRLS TO SELF WORSE THESE PIECES AND DOS MENTOR RAIN CRITERIA MODELED OFF OF THE STATE'S STANDARDS WHICH PRIORITIZE KEEPING NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES INTACT. AND PERMITS PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING. NINE ALSO REQUIRES MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESS -- IS SO DIVERSE CONSTITUENCIES ESPECIALLY NON ENGLISH SPEAKING ONES CAN HAVE A VOICE IN THE REDUCING PROCESS. TOGETHER WE THINK THESE CHANGES A PROPOSED MAYBE IT FOUR NINE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO MORE REPRESENTATIVE INCLUSIVE AND KIND OF A LOCAL MARK SEE. I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED WITH THE RECENT STREAMLINING AMENDMENTS. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATIONS INCLUDING C. SECONDLY HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION THE BONE GONE TO NEUTRAL I JUST WANT EXPRESS MY STRONG GRATITUDE. TO THOSE SENSATIONS WORKING VERY CLEVER DEFINITELY WITH US TO GET TO THIS POINT. FOR ALL THESE REASONS ON BEHALF OF A BROAD COALITION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND TO GOVERN ORGANIZATIONS WE SPOKE EARLIER TONIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE NOT RICHARD OR MISS ROSE FROM LEGAL IN VOTERS TO MORNING CHAIR REQUIRE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. SO THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE A REALLY WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE FIGHT FOR STATE LEVEL INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING AND THEN ALL OF THE CRITERIA THAT INCLUDES. OUR LOCAL LEAGUES WORK TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL REDISTRICTING IS TRANSPARENT THAT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IS ROBUST THAT IT IS MEANINGFUL AND THAT EVERY COMMUNITY IS ENGAGE SO THAT THAT LINE DRAWING REALLY RESULT IN. A FAIR REPRESENTATION OF THE AREA'S DIVERSITY. BUT IT IS A SPECIFIC IAN STRUGGLE WHEN DISTRICT MAPS -- DRAFTED INTRODUCED AND ADOPTED ALL AT ONCE WITHOUT FIRST BEING PUBLISHED AND SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC OR WHEN THERE'S NO HARD STANDARD REQUIRING THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES RE DISTRICT WITH A FOCUS ON KEEPING THOSE COMMUNITIES INTACT. WE ARE A MAJORITY MINORITY STATE BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT DIVERSITY REPRESENTED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SO WE NEED INSTITUTIONALIZE PUBLIC OUTREACH TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT LINE DRAWING IS AN INCLUSIVE EXERCISE WE NEED IT TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WHOSE FIRST LANGUAGE ISN'T ENGLISH WHICH THIS BILL PROVIDES. THE WORK THAT WE DID AT THE STATE LEVEL PROVIDES A REAL CLEAR NATIONAL STANDARD OF% EXCELLENCE AND NOW IT'S TIME TO FIX REDISTRICTING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN CITIES AND COUNTIES BY REQUIRING TRANSPARENCY BY LAYING OUT FAIR CONSISTENT CRITERIA FOR THEM TO USE. WE HOPE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO JOIN US IN SUPPORTING AB EIGHT FORTY NINE AND BRING CALIFORNIA ONE STEP CLOSER TO THAT REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY THAT WE ARE ALL LOOKING. FOR THANK YOU AND THINK THESE CITIES AND COUNTIES -- ORGANIZATIONS FOR WORKING WITH US SO HARD TO MAKE THIS BILL SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL GET BEHIND.

AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS A REGIONAL BEAR A BILL TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR REGION UNFORTUNATELY OUR REGION HAS BEEN THE EPICENTER OF THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS WITH RECORD HOME PRICES. THE RECORD RENTS RECORD EVICTION LEVELS AND RECORD LEVELS OF HOMELESSNESS. TAKE REALLY AFTER MANY SAW HOUSING STAFF AND FUNDING GOT IT AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT IT'S ESTIMATED AT THIS POINT. OUR REGION HAS A TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS YEARLY. NEED FOR FUNDING AROUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE INTENT OF THIS BILLS TO ENABLE THE BAY AREA TO HELP OURSELVES TO GIVE THE NINE COUNTY REGION THE AUTHORITY TO RAISE FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SIMILAR TO HOW THE REGION HAS RECEIVED LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO RAISE FUNDS FOR TRANSPORTATION. THANKS TO CENTRE BELL AND OTHERS AS WELL AS RESTORATION OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. MY INTENT IS THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILLS ALSO TO GIVE THE REGION A SIGNIFICANT VOICE AND HOW THEY WANT THIS BILL TO WORK IN TERMS OF GOVERNANCE.

IN THE PAST MONTH THE MTC IN A BAG TO PUT TOGETHER AN AD HOC COMMITTEE SPECIFICALLY TO GIVE US A MORE DETAILED PROPOSAL ON WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THIS BILL. THE BILL THAT YOU HAVE AND PRINT REFLECTS THEIR INPUT THUS FAR. BUT THAT BEING SAID I'M IN FULL AGREEMENT WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT THE BEST PATH FORWARD IS TO GIVE THE FULL REGIONAL BODIES. THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER AND HOPEFULLY VOTE ON THEIR OWN AD HOC COMMITTEES RECOMMENDATIONS THOSE VOTES ARE SCHEDULED TO OCCUR IN THE COMING WEEKS.

MY CITY OF TWELVE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS. IS FACING A GROWING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND DISPLACEMENT CRISIS MEDIUM AND SMALL SIZED CITIES IN THE BAY AREA ARE FEELING THE EFFECTS OF THE STATE WHAT HOUSING CRISIS. AND DESPERATELY NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO PRESERVE ADDITION TO PRESERVE EXISTING HOUSING PROTECT HANDS FROM DISPLACEMENT AND BUILD NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

AND PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOMES I'M ALSO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF THEIR GOVERNMENTS A REGIONAL COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS REPRESENT THE CITIES AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA. HOWEVER I WANT TO CLARIFY NOT SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION EVENTS THAT. BOTH THE A BANK EXECUTIVE BOARD NMTC COMMISSION HAVE ENGAGE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS IN DISCUSSIONS ON LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS. WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS A ESIRE TO NOT CREATE A NEW BUREAUCRACY? AND HAVE ROBUST LOCAL GOVERNMENT INPUT AND HOW FUNDS DERIVED FROM AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WOULD BE ALLOCATED. BOTH THE EIGHT A BACKBOARD AN ANTI SEE CREATED IN AND OUT COMMITTEE AS REFERENCE BY. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO DEVELOP A SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT REFLECTS THE INPUT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA. AND THE COMMITTEE INCLUDING REPRESENTATION FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES BIG AND SMALL THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA. WE MET EXTENSIVELY OVER THE PAST MONTHS I SERVE ON THAT AT ALL COMMITTEE. WE ROLLED UP OUR SLEEVES AND DUG INTO THE DETAILS OF THE BILL AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT WE'VE REACHED AGREEMENT. AND MANY KEY POINTS ALL REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT VERSION THE BILL WHICH I DO BELIEVE REFLECT MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD. FROM GOVERNMENTS OF ALL SIZES IN THE BAY AREA. WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF OUR OF THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE CHAIR TO GET ADDITIONAL TIME TO WORK WITH A BAG NBC. DURING THE LEGISLATIVE RECESS WE CAN BRING BACK UP HILL THAT ACTUALLY WILL HELP MOVE OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS FORD.

THANK YOU SO MUCH AS TO MAYOR WE'RE GONNA BE HEADING THERE IN CASE WE HAVE QUESTIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WELCOME GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. HI I'M GIVE THE ROW AND I'M WITH ENTERPRISE CAN BE PARTNERS AND WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE CO SPONSORING THIS BILL. OUR MISSION IS TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES THROUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LAST YEAR I CO AUTHORED THIS REPORT IT'S CALLED THE ELEPHANT IN THE REGION CHARTING THE PATH FOR BAY AREA MEASURE TO LEAD A BOLD HOUSING AGENDA. AND IN THIS REPORT WE LOOKED AT HOW OTHER REGIONS IN THE ACT AND THE COUNTRY OR ADDRESSING THEIR AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. AND FOR REGIONS THAT ARE DOING IT WELL. THERE'S TWO KEY FINDINGS ONE IS THAT THERE'S THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND IT'S BUILT ON ASSIST SUFFICIENT FUNDING AND THE CAPACITY TO ADMINISTER EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS. AND SO WE'RE INVESTED IN THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST STEP TO BUILDING THE HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE -- TO RIGHT NOW WE RELY ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO SOLVE THE ENTIRE REGIONS HOUSING CRISIS. AND AS WE'VE HEARD SO MANY OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE -- THE BEEN LEFT ESSENTIALLY ANY MAKE AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES THEY DON'T HAVE FUNDING THE STAFFING NOR DO THEY REALLY HAVE THE EXPERTISE. AND SO THIS IS A BILL THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL HELP THESE JURISDICTIONS IT'S ALL CARROTS. AND SO WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING SEVERAL CITIES IN THE BAY AREA AND THEY'VE ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH THESE EXAMPLES OF HOW A REGIONAL APPROACH CAN HELP THEM. THE NEXT JUST NATURAL DISASTER HITS REGIONAL RESOURCES CAN SWIFTLY BUILD REBUILD HOMES AND COMMUNITIES. CAN PROVIDE THE CRITICAL GAP FUNDING NEEDED FOR TEO DE DEVELOPMENTS AND SERVICE AND RICH HOUSING FOR THE HOMELESS. AND IT CAN -- PROVIDE HOUSING EXPERTISE TO CREATE EFFECTIVE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR THOSE FAMILIES THAT ARE THREATENED BY DISPLACEMENT. AND SO IT'S JUST SIMPLY A SET OF TOOLS IT'S A WAY FOR BEAR Và BAY AREA VOTERS. TO RAISE FUNDS AND TO ADDRESS THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY.

AND I SERVE ON THE NEVADA CITY COUNCIL AND I'VE BEEN SERVING IN THAT CAPACITY FOR OVER TWENTY FOUR YEARS. AND I'VE SERVED AS MAYOR SIX YEARS BECAUSE WE ROTATE LIKE MOST CITIES IN CALIFORNIA. I ALSO SERVE ON THE A BAG EXECUTIVE BOARD. AND I ALSO AND PAST PRESIDENT OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. I'M SPEAKING TODAY -- ON MY OWN BEHALF AND FOR ALL THOSE OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS IN CITIES THAT ARE OPPOSED. TO FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND LET ME TELL YOU FUNDAMENTALLY WHY -- A AND I SUPPORT THIS EXTRA TIME BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP. THIS LEGISLATION IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED IN MY OPINION. WE DO NOT NEED ANOTHER. YET ANOTHER REGIONAL AGENCY -- THE BAG HAS THE AUTHORITY AND HAS BEEN WORKING ON HOUSING. FOR OVER. FIFTY YEARS SINCE IT WAS FORMED IN. NINETEEN SIXTY ONE MTC IS THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY WHAT FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN DOES. IS IT TAKES THE STORY OF HOUSING AWAY FROM A BAG AND GIVES IT TO MTC AND THAT IS WRONG. A BAG IS THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS FOR WE HAVE MEMBERS HUNDRED AND ONE CITIES AND THE NINE COUNTIES ARE ALL MEMBERS OF A BAG THEY PAY DUES THE PAY MEMBERSHIP. AND THEY GET SERVICE BACK. THERE IS WRONG THERE'S A YOUR STAFF REPORT IS WRONG IN SEVERAL PLACES AND I'M GOOD IF IN THIS IS FOCUSING ON ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION OF CITIES. MTC STARTED KASA. THEY STARTED CAST A DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN WITHOUT A BAGS KNOWLEDGE. FOR INVOLVEMENT. WHY DO I KNOW BECAUSE I WAS AT THAT M. T. C. HEARING? AND I WAS SHOCKED VERY DISAPPOINTED. THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE AND THE STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE ALL SELECTED BY MTC A BAG HAD NO. THE WORDY OR INPUT ON WHO WAS REPRESENTING -- FOLKS IN FACT ON THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE THERE'S TWO STAFF MEMBERS SAN FRANCISCO. AND OAKLAND NO SMALL CITIES. ON THE STEERING COMMITTEE. THERE WERE -- SMALL CITY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND BIG ONES BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY DID NOT SPEAK FOR CITIES. CITIES WERE NOT INFORMED OF CASTLE FOR OVER TWO YEARS. THROUGH THIS WHOLE EFFORT CITIES WERE NOT TOLD WHAT WAS GOING ON SO CITIES HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR. THAT YOU'RE GONNA PUT A PAUSE ON THIS BUT I WANTED TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SIGNATURE PAGE. THE SIGNATURE PAGE ON THE SECOND PAGE HAS. NO CITY REPRESENTED SEPARATE CITY REPRESENTATIVES. THEY'RE ALL SUPERVISORS. THAT HAVE SIGNED THIS LETTER. I'M A BAG EXECUTIVE BOARD HAS NOT BEEN INFORMED OF THIS GROUP THAT HAS BEEN FORMED BETWEEN MTC IN A BAG. ON LOOKING AT FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WE HAVE NOT BEEN INFORMED I'M ON THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE. MEETING ON FRIDAY WE HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN TOLD THAT A SEPARATE GROUP HAS BEEN FORMED. LET ME GIVE YOU AN AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ADEQUATE CITY REPRESENTATION BECAUSE LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THEY JUST FORMED. A BAG JUST FORMED -- INSERTED MTC THE COMMITTEE THAT'S GOING TO LOOK AT THE GOVERNANCE. THEY HAVE EIGHT SUPERVISORS. THEY HAD THREE CITY REPRESENTATIVES AND THEN NICK. NECK USED TO BE ON PARTY WAS ELECTED OFFICIAL HE IS NO LONGER AN ELECTED OFFICIAL ANY SERVICE ON MTC AS THE MAYOR'S REPRESENTATIVE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. THIRTY SECONDS WE HAVE A HUNDRED WHEN CITIES IS THREE CITY REPRESENTATIVES ON THE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE ADEQUATE NO. AND THEY ARE NOT PUTTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ON THESE COMMITTEES. AND SO I IMPLORE. THIS COMMITTEE AND YOUR LEADERSHIP. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE CITY REPRESENTATION AND THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ON THESE COMMITTEES. ARE YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DIVIDE THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES. IN OUR BAY AREA. I HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY ON FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BUT THAT. HE AYE WE NED YOUR HELP. THEY'RE NOT PUTTING PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ON THESE COMMITTEES AND AS A CONSEQUENCE -- IT. I HAVE BEEN IN GOVERNMENT ALMOST ALL MY LIFE WORK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR FORTY THREE YEARS SEVEN MONTHS IN ELEVEN DAYS. I WORKED FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS WITH THE EPA WHERE I HELP IMPLEMENT FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. I DID COMBINED THE I. S. C. I. OURS SO I KNOW GOVERNMENT IN I HAVE A PASSION FOR GOVERNMENT. BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WITH A BAG NMTC. IS IS NOT APPROPRIATE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ARE ENGAGED IN THE DISCUSSION AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING THANK YOU SO MUCH COUNCIL AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL -- BEFORE WE TURNED OVER TO MISTER WOLF QUICKLY SO. WHAT? ARE YOU SEE ANY NEED SAID MT SEEING A BAG HAVE FORMED THIS JOINT AD HOC. THAT JOINT AD HOC -- IS BEING CHAIRED BY MISTER PER DROZ -- FROM THE COUNTY NAPA THE A BAG REPRESENTATIVES ON THIS AD HOC IS AT MAYOR AGAIN. FROM THE CITY BERKELEY -- SUPERVISOR CHAVEZ FROM SANTA CLARA. I SUPERVISOR CONNELLY FROM MARIN -- JULIE PIERCE WHO IS FROM THE CLAYTON CITY COUNCIL. HI DAVID RABBIT CINEMA SUPERVISOR IN A WORN SLOCUM. WHO IS A SAN MATTEO SUPERVISOR WE ALSO FROM MTC HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE RING TO CITY COUNCIL -- IS WELL. ON THEIR ALONG WITH CHEN SPEARING THE SLOT OF SUPERVISORS I THINK THAT THAT THAT GIVES IT THE PERFECT EXAMPLE WHAT THAT THERE'S NOT ADEQUATE CITY REPRESENTATION THERE'S A HUNDRED AND ONE CITIES AND NINE COUNTIES. AND THERE'S NO DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ON THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH COUNCILMAN AND I'M HAPPY TO SIT BACK DOWN OR SIT DOWN WITH YOU IN I HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION RETURN OVER MISTER WOLF -- FOR OPPOSITION. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I'LL BE BRIEF DAVID WILL FOR THE HER JERVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TAT. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MEMBERS I DO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE HERE VERY CAR I GREW UP IN MARIN COUNTY AND I'M ACTUALLY A GRADUATE OF CINEMA STATE UNIVERSITY. SO I DO I DO ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND BAY AREA HOUSING AND WHAT'S GOING ON HERE THERE IS FUNDAMENTALLY A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE THIRD OF RENTERS SPEND HALF OF THEIR TAKE HOME PAY. ON RENT WE NEED A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS OF THE HOUSING YEAR TO KEEP PACE WITH DEMAND LAST YEAR WE BUILT A HUNDRED AND TEN OVER THE COURSE OF HISTORY. THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN FOUR YEARS OUT OF THE LAST TWENTY WERE REBUILT AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS OF NEW HOUSING WE ARE WELL WELL BEHIND THE CURVE ON THIS. BUT TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE. BY AUTHORIZING NEW PERSONAL TAXES WHEN ONLY 30% OF CALIFORNIANS CAN AFFORD A MEDIAN PRICED HOME. MEMBERS IS NOT GOING TO GET IT DONE NOW WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL IN PRINT AND OBVIOUSLY I UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW WE'RE PUTTING THIS ON HOLD FOR A BIT AND WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS GOVERNANCE ISSUES TO WORK THROUGH I UNDERSTAND THAT APPRECIATIVE OF THAT THANKFUL FOR THAT I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE HOW IT ALL WORKS OUT. BUT AGAIN ONE THIRD OF ONLY ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS CAN FORTY MEDIAN PRICE TIMER AGGRESSIVE PERSONAL TAXES ARE NOT THE WAY TO GET THAT DONE. SO -- CERTAINLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON THE BILL AS ITS IMPRINT AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH EVERYONE. YOU SO MUCH MISTER WOLF OF WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MISTER JONES IN OPPOSITION YES MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER DAVID JONES ON BEHALF OF THE MARIN COUNTY -- CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS IN MERS CAUCUS -- WE SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE COUNCIL WOMAN ON GOVERNMENT SPECIFICALLY -- CREATING ANOTHER LAYER OF GOVERNMENT IS PROBLEMATIC FOR US LACK OF STABLE FUNDING FOR THE EXISTING STAFF. AT A BAG IN TO SEE TO DO THIS TASK SO WE HAVE A CONCERNS ALSO ABOUT CROWDING OUT OF OUR TAXES IF WE HAVE ONE IN C. RAISING TAXES IN AN AREA. THE LOCAL AND HE MIGHT HAVE LESS OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE TAXES IF THEY SO WE NEEDED TO DO SO SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE JOIN IN OPPOSITION. BUT WE ALSO APPLAUD THE PAUSE BUTTON WE THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY NEEDS A LOT MORE TIME FOR DIALOGUE. HAVE MORE OF A CONSENSUS SO THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH JONES. FOR THE MORNING. GOOD MORNING MICHAEL BARNES MEMBER OF THE ALBANY CITY COUNCIL SPEAKING FOR MYSELF. YES THANK YOU FOR HITTING THE PAUSE BUTTON I APPRECIATED I DO WANT TO OBJECT TO WHAT IS TRANSPIRED SO FAR. AND THE NOTION THAT THE BAY AREA IS THE EPICENTER OF THIS HOUSING CRISIS THAT IS REALLY NOT TRUE THE BAY AREA IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE IT'S HIGH SALARIES IS BETTER OFF. THAN MANY OF THE OTHER COUNTIES IN THE STATE LA COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY WOULD BE BETTER EXAMPLES OF PROBLEM OF STREET. WITH THERE'S DEEP PROBLEMS. SECONDLY A MTC IS. TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION I'VE NEVER DONE HOUSING I AM BAFFLED WHY IN T. C. WOULD WANT TO STEP INTO A AN AREA IN WYOMING WOULD WANT THEM TO STEP INTO AN AREA FOR WHICH THEY HAVE NO EXPERTISE. MEMBER OF A CITY COUNCIL A SMALL CITY WE ARE WORKING CURRENTLY TO DEVELOP AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT IN OUR TOWN I DO RESENT THE IMPLICATION THAT. OUR STAFF IS NOT COMPETENT AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES. WE HAVE A VERY COMPETENT STAFF WE ARE MOVING AHEAD ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FRANKLY I THINK IN DC IS GOING TO BE AN IMPEDIMENT. WE WOULD MUCH PREFER THAT THIS GET FOCUSED AT THE STATE LEVEL. WE HAVE POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH CD AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE EMPHASIS WITH H. CD. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY WOULD LIKE TO BE RECEIVED AS ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO COULD PLEASE COME FOR THIS TIME. IT'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AGAIN I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE LAY THIS OUT. CORRECTLY HE THE AD HOC WAS SELECTED -- ON BEHALF OF BOTH IN DC IN A BAG. THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ME TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS. THEY WILL BE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS. TO EACH OF THE TWO BOARDS BOTH A BAG AS WELL AS IN DC. IN THIS WILL ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL TIME TO BE ABLE TO FLUSH OUT THE PROPOSAL HERE IN THE COMING THIRTY TO FORTY DAYS. AND MY UNDERSTANDING WE DO HAVE THE MEMBERSHIP HERE. THEY'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON THE REPRESENTING THE REGION'S AT THE BAY AREA UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT COUNCILMAN HUSSEIN IS. THERE MAY BE A MORE SUPERVISORS AND COUNCILMEMBERS BUT THE REGIONS OF THE BAY AREA. HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL THE TURN IT OVER -- FOR ANY AT SOMEONE WOULD YOU HAVE TO BE A COMMON JUST WANNA MAKE IT A COUPLE BECOME IS FIRST OF ALL TO THE COUNCIL AND I KNOW YOU CONTACT OUR OFFICE JUST THE OTHER DAY AND WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH OVER EMAIL BUT I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIT. DOWN WITH YOU TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER. THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT YOU SAID I JUST WANT TO START THE CONVERSATION. FIRST OF ALL -- THIS IS NOT A CASA BILL CASA DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE THIS IS A BILL BECAUSE MANY WAS. EVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE REGIONAL RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS AND AND SO I WANT TO SAY THAT. THEY ARE ALSO BETTER AS YOU CAN IAGINE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH A BAG AND THE M. T. C. AT THIS POINT AS THE GERAN JUST MENTION. THERE'S A JOINT COMMITTEE BUT I ALSO MENTION THAT THE INITIAL SKETCH OF AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE CONTEMPLATING TO MOVE FORWARD HOPEFULLY IN A MONTH CONTEMPLATE A VERY SIGNIFICANT ROLE FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF A BAG. MOVING FORWARD AND AND I'M HAPPY TO DEFER -- TO ARE BERKELEY MAYOR ON THAT QUESTION BUT I WANT TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR THE THE ROLE. FOR A BAG AS FAR AS DEVELOPING POTENTIAL PROPOSALS AROUND EXPENDITURE AROUND THE PROGRAMMING OF THAT FUND AROUND EXPECTED HOW THE MONEY IS REYES AND HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT. VERY MUCH CONTEMPLATES A SIGNIFICANT ROLE FOR A BAG SO I I WANT TO SAY THAT -- AND THEN -- THERE WAS A SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW WE ARE NOT ENGAGING WITH THE VERY COMPETENT STAFF OF A BAG. COULD NOT DISAGREE WITH THAT MORE IN FACT I HAD A MEETING WITH A BAG STAFF A WEEK AGO ON THIS VERY TOPIC. I AM VERY MUCH RESPECT THE LEADERSHIP OF OF A BACK -- TO TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SPECIFIC GOVERNANCE OF A BAG IN THE EMPTY EMPTY SAY I'LL JUST LAY OUT WHY THIS HAS BEEN DIFFICULT. SO INITIALLY WE PROPOSE THERE TO BE A REGIONAL AGENCY AND WHAT WE HAD HEARD BOTH IT'S FROM A BAG AN MTC WAS THERE ARE TWO REGIONAL AGENCIES ALREADY WHY DO WE NEED A THIRD. AND SO IT IS CONTEMPLATED RATHER THAN CREATING AN ENTIRELY NEW REGIONAL AGENCY THAT WE HAVE PASSED ANTI SEEN A BACK TO WORK TOGETHER. TO FIGURE OUT HOW COLLECTIVELY THOSE TWO BODIES CAN TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE NEED TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. SO THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OF HOW WE'RE DOING THIS BUT I SHOULD ALSO SAY AS YOU KNOW. M. T. C. IS VIEWED AS A BODY IT'S A REGIONAL BODY -- BUT BECAUSE THERE APPEARS TO BE A HEAVY AWAY FROM FROM LARGER CITIES THAT HAS CREATED A RACKED REACTION FROM SOME OF THE SMALLER AND SUBURBAN CITIES. LIKE WISE BECAUSE THE MTC AND HOW IT'S STRUCTURED TYPICALLY HAVING ONE VOTE PER CITY IT IS VIEWED AS BEING MORE REPRESENTATIVE FOR SMALLER AND SUBURBAN CITIES AND SO WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO WITH THIS BILL. IS TO REALLY ASK BOTH BODIES TO WORK TOGETHER. IN MOVING THIS FORWARD AND AS YOU KNOW BOTH ANTI SEEN A BAG ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION AS WE SPEAK ABOUT HOW TO DO BETTER WORK TOGETHER SO THAT IS REALLY. THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HAVING ONE BODY OR THE OTHER DICTATE FUNDING WOULD BE LIKE SUGGESTING THAT IN THIS CASE THE SENATE THE U. S. SENATE. OUGHT TO DECIDE FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT HAS ONE OR TWO VOTES PER STATE. THAT THAT HAS CREATED A LITTLE BIT OF REACTION FROM FROM SOME CITIES THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS JUST HAVING HOUSE DICTATE THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE SO AGAIN WE'VE SAID TO AIM TO SEEN A BACK CAN CAN THE TWO AGENCIES WORK TOGETHER. THAT HAS TAKEN SOME TIME BUT MY HOPE IS AND I'M A VERY -- AGAIN NOT JUST APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK OF YOU ANOTHER -- LOCAL LEGISLATORS BUT THE FEEDBACK FROM ALL OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF EIGHT AND A BAG AN MTC ON THIS THIS WILL MAKE THE BILL BETTER AND THAT IS OUR HOPE OVER THE NEXT MONTH THAT WE INCORPORATE THAT FEEDBACK SO LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT. I DON'T KNOW MAY HAVE MAYORIF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD A NEW ONE WANT TO GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AS AS SOON AS WE CAN THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER MAYOR QUICKLY AND THEN WE'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TO MY SENATOR ABOUT. SO I JUST WANNA CLARIFY INITIALLY WITH BILL SUPPOSE I DIDN'T SUPPORT CREATING A NEW BUREAUCRACY I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE THAT A BAG OR MTC. TAKE ON THIS ROLE OF RUNNING THIS NEW REGIONAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY THAT WAS THE OVER RIDING CONCERN THAT WE'VE HEARD. FROM CITIES OF ALL SIZES THE BAY AREA AND THE BILL AMENDMENTS THAT WE WORKED OUT. THE AUTHORS ACCEPTED WOULD HAVE A JOINT RESPONSIBILITY FOR BOTH A BAG NMTC TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THE EXPENDITURE PLAN. ON THE ACTUAL ALLOCATION FOR PROJECTS THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO AROUND OUR SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY PLAN BAY AREA WE'RE BOTH AGENCIES WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THE REGIONAL LAND USE PLAN. SO I THINK THIS PRESIDENT WE YOU KNOW WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER AND THERE'S GONNA BE A MUCH BROADER CONVERSATION ON SHARED REGIONAL GOVERNANCE IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS MAYOR IF I COULD TURN OVER CONVERSATION IN THE WALL -- I KNOW THAT MS SECOND WOULD LIKE ME TO SAY A FEW WORDS PRIOR -- TO CLOSING -- IT WITH MR CHIU LET'S HAVE THE COMMITTEE DANCING COMMENTS QUESTIONS CENTER ABOUT. WELL AS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE FROM THE BAY AREA LET'S BE VERY INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSIONS SO -- GENERALLY -- OF FROM SAN JOSE'S PERSPECTIVE -- WE SEE -- A LOT OF HOUSING BUILDING SAN JOSE THIS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND A LOT OF WORK DONE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. BUT WE SEE OUR REMAINING NEIGHBORS NOT PRODUCING -- I'LL JUST SAY. THEIR FAIR SHARE. OR OR OR ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING THE BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO IT'S KIND OF LONG STANDING -- PROBLEM. AND I THINK THAT HAVING A REGIONAL OF KIND OF APPROACH. MIGHT BE ONE WAY OF SOLVING THAT THAT ISSUE. MY MY PARTICULAR VIEW IS THAT -- OF THE CONDUCT OF THE LEGISLATORS SHOULD BE. YEAH WE GOT TO DO IT THE HARD WAY FOLKS. THE HARDWARE IS KIND OF LIKE HOW WE DID REGIONAL MEASURE. THREE WHICH WAS. AS ALWAYS ALL THE BERRY LEGISLATORS KNOW VERY DIFFICULT TO GET. THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE BAY AREA LET LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION. ARE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. AROUND THE BAY THE NINE COUNTY -- CONGESTION MANAGEMENT AGENCIES AND ALL. OF THE COUNTY -- AREAS INCLUDING YOURS -- MADAM COUNCILMAN -- TO SUPPORT THE THE REGIONAL MEASURE THREE THE GOT PLACED ON THE BALLOT. AS SUCCESSFULLY VOTED ON IN THE BAY AREA WHEN WE PUT THAT ON THE BALLOT. IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND I THINK IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AS YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS BECAUSE YOU WORKED ON IT VERY HARD WITH ME. AND SIR MCGUIRE AND CENTER WINNER AND EVERYBODY ELSE WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE WE WORK SO WE DID THAT PREP WORK THAT WAS SO DIFFICULT. THE TWO YET -- SOME PEOPLE SAID IS LIKE HERDING FERAL CATS YOU KNOW WITH THE BAY AREA POLITICS BUT BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT WE HAVE TO KIND OF WORK TOGETHER. AND BRING OURSELVES TOGETHER BUT I BUT I BELIEVE I BELIEVE STRONGLY. THERE ARE A REGIONAL HOUSING ORGANIZATION. COULD BE AS SIMPLE ORGANIZATION COULD BE AS SIMPLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IF YOU'RE FOCUSING ON JUST BUILDING A HOUSING. GETTING A HOUSING PROGRAMS GOING JUST YOU KNOW KEEP KEEP IT SIMPLE -- I TAKE -- WE CAN BE VERY SUCCESSFUL AND HAVING A AND A MEDIA TO IMPACT ON ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE BAY AREA WHICH WE SO DESPERATELY NEED. IT'S IT'S IT'S PROBABLY THE MAJOR REASON WHY. OUR ECONOMY COULD LAG IN THE BAY AREA. IS BECAUSE A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S IT'S IT'S WE'RE AT WE'RE AT A POINT WERE OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START LOSING THEIR JOBS AND BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO START TO LEAVE. AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE FROM THE REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE THAT'S WHY SUPPORT THIS BILL -- GOING FORWARD AND HAVING TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION IS GOING TO BE SO IMPORTANT. THAT -- OF IT'S IT'S NOT ABOUT -- IT'S NOT ABOUT US IT'S ABOUT THEM I KEEP TELLING MYSELF THAT'S ONE OF MY SAYINGS I GIVE MY STAFF IS NOT ABOUT US. MEETING OUR PAROCHIAL INTEREST OR WHATEVER OUR PROPUBLICA ABOUT THEM IT'S ABOUT WHO WE SERVE IN THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE BE -- STRONGLY WORKING WITH ALL THE COLLEAGUES IT MAYBE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND IT WAS DIFFICULT MEMBER ARM THREE WAS VERY DIFFICULT. REMEMBER THAT -- YEAH. YEAH THAT MEETING RIGHT OKAY SO I HAD TO KIND OF PUT THE HAMMER DOWN A FEW TIMES. YES YOU DID YEAH AREN'T NOW WHERE ELSE SOMETIMES WE GO DO THAT YOU KNOW BUT AS THOSE OF A PERSON THAT SERVED ON ANTI SEE FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS AND YOU KNOW I THINK IN TO SEE CAN TRANSFORM AND MAYOR TO THE THE CARD ORGANIZATION WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL. TO YOUR COMMUNITY THAT CAN HELP MAKE YOUR COMMUNITY A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AND HAVE THE HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WORK IN YOUR COMMUNITY. PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW THE DO THE WORK THAT ARE. MOVING OUT AND CAUSING A LOT OF AIR POLLUTION BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND AFFORDABLE. HOUSING AND OUR OWN PLACES WHERE THEY CLOSE WHERE THEY WORK SO. SO I THINK -- IT'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE AS WELL AS ECONOMIC ISSUE AND A KIND OF A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE SO -- I I SUPPORTED -- THE GERMAN. FROM THE ASSEMBLY AND EVERYBODY ELSE -- WORKING ON THIS -- OVERVIEW STRONGLY WORKING ON THIS OVER THE SUMMER WE HAVE TO GET THIS JOB DONE. THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE FOR THE BAY AREA. WE CONSERVING EXAM OUT AS AN EXAMPLE OF OTHER. OTHER AREAS IN THE STATE -- WORKING TOGETHER -- AND I KNOW WE CAN DO A GOOD JOB IN PULLING THIS TOGETHER SO I'LL BE HAPPY TO OF SUPPORTERS. AND SUPPORTS -- MY EFFORTS TO FORGE A CONSENSUS WITH YOU AND THE WORK YOU'RE DOING -- OF A MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR GETTING TO BURY IT TOGETHER ON THIS I'LL DO ANYTHING I CAN HELP YOU ON THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS CENTER BALLOT IN WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING SENATOR BAIL HEARING CENTER WIENER.

CHALLENGES AND APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH ALSO CLOSING COMMENTS IT'LL TURN TO RESCIND THE VIRTUE FOR HIS CLOSING COMMENTS BUT PLEASE CANCEL WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. ANY FINAL COMMENTS PLEASE YEAH FOR SO I WANTED TO THANK YOU ALL FOR PUTTING THE POTS ON THIS AND I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMAN CHIU FOR REACHING OUT -- AND I STILL THINK IN ORDER FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER. A BAG MTC HAS TO INCLUDE. INDIVIDUALS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS. HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION. BECAUSE THE STRENGTH OF THE DECISION AT THE END IS A LOT STRONGER WHEN YOU HAVE. OF VOICES ON ALL SIDES. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT TO ADD PROGRESS TO MAKE -- AND YOU MAY BE SEEING ME IN A MONTH. NO ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO MUCH AS WOMEN ARE GREAT FOR THE YOU'RE HERE AS WELL AND FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK IN MANY MANY YEARS OF WORK THAT YOU PUT IN.

BE PASSED EVER APPROPRIATIONS AND THEN ON TO THE SENATE FLOOR WE WOULD IN MAINE ON THE SENATE FLOOR.

THAT THE STATE IN OUR REGION IS GRAPPLING WITH I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM -- AND WHAT A GREAT PARTNER HE IS TO WORK WITH THE STRAIGHT UP.

AND LOCALS CAN CHARGE FEES TO COVER THOSE COSTS OUR BILL ADDRESSES SEVERAL CHALLENGES FIRST THE FACT THAT ZONING I OFTEN A BEAR TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. EXISTING ZONING ARE OFTEN TOO LOW FOR AFFORDABLE PROJECTS TO PENCIL OUT. SECONDLY WE ALL KNOW HOW SCARE SUPPORT A HOUSING FUNDING IS WE NEED TO STRETCH EVERY DOLLAR TO BUILD AS MANY UNITS AS WE CAN. AND THEN THIRDLY FOR THOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS THAT ARE COMPETING WITH MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS MORE DENSITY CAN MAKE A PROJECT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE GIVEN THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ORGANIZATION THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE FOR SITES UNDER OUR BILL A 100%. FOR WILL HOUSING PROJECTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE 480% DENSITY BONUSES ABOVE EXISTING DENSITY. ZONE DENSITY AS WELL AS WITH ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES AND CONCESSIONS.

JONES COMES AT THE TABLE WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE A IS PLEASE COME ON FOR ARE WE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE SPEAKING THE IN OPPOSITION. WE WELCOME BOTH GENTLEMEN I TO THE TABLE. GERMAN WHO WOULD LIKE ME TO GO FIRST WEBER DOES FOR OLDER THAN THAT. ROCK PAPER SCISSORS PLEASE -- PLEASE MISTER JONES -- FIRST LAST ORGANIZATION YOU HAVE TO ANSWER DAVID JONES A MAP THE CITIES OF BURBANK AND SAN MARCOS AGAIN -- WE UNDERSTAND AND REALIZE THAT THE EXTREME NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE HAVE A GREAT SYMPATHY FOR BUILDING THEM SAN MARCOS IS A CITY THAT IS -- EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE -- THEY HAVE THREE THOUSAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THE SECOND MOST AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS BUILT IN ANY CITY IN SAN DIEGO. SAN DIEGO COUNTY RIGHT BEHIND THE CAN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO SO THEY HAVE DONE A VERY VERY GOOD -- JOB IN PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING. YOU KNOW. HE PERCENT DENSITY GIVEN TO A VERY LARGE ADDITIONAL THREE STORIES ON TOP OF THAT WEDGED INTO SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN MY TESTIMONY. SAN MARCOS HAS THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION WE HAVE A VERY VERY -- IMPACTED NEIGHBORHOODS ARE CITIZENS ARE HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD AS FAR AS ACCEPTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHIN THEIR THEIR COMMUNITIES SO WEAK LIKE I MENTIONED EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THREE THOUSAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT WERE BUILT BY REDEVELOPMENT MONEY SO. WE HAVE A REDEVELOPMENT I DID A FABULOUS JOB AND LOSS OF IT IS CLEARLY ON OUR MINDS NOW -- BUT THE PARKING ISSUE FOR US IS IS VERY EXTREME BURBANK ARE OF THE CLIENT HAS TWELVE THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING BING -- IN THE PIPELINE BEING DEVELOPED SO THEY'RE NOT SHIRKING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY SO HAVING THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING SOME OF THEIR PARCELS HAVE THIS KIND OF DENSIFICATION WITHOUT. OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS WILL HAVE EXTREMELY IMPACTS ON THOSE COMMUNITIES IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE ALREADY BENDING OVER BACKWARDS IN TRYING TO GET THE COMMUNITIES TO ACCEPT HIGHER DENSIFICATION. AND WITH THIS BILL IT WOULD SUDDENLY THROW A LOT OF THAT OUT THE WINDOW AND WE POTENTIALLY WOULD HAVE. MUCH MORE HIGHER DENSITIES IN CERTAIN AREAS WHERE THE COMMUNITIES OF ALREADY MADE THE MADE THE CONCESSIONS IN THE COMMUNITIES ALREADY SAID WE WILL ACCEPT. HIGHER DENSIFICATION AN THEN TO HAVE THIS BILL COMING IN AND SUDDENLY HAVE THAT NUMBER CHANGED TO A MUCH HIGHER POTENTIAL DOWN DENSITY WOULD BE VERY VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR BOTH OUR CLIENTS SO. FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU HIS CHANCE GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON -- MISTER CHAIR JOHN CLAN FOR THE CITY OF ITS IT IS TO DETERMINE THE SAME COMMENTS THAT -- MISTER JONES IS MADE. SORT OF BIGGER PICTURE FROM -- THE CITY EVEN SINISE RESPECTIVE DENSITY BONUS TENDS TO ELICIT STRONG REACTIONS FROM ITS CITIZENRY IN TERMS OF FEEL THE THAT IT GOES AROUND THE GENERAL pPLAN PROCESS AND SETTING THOSE -- APPROPRIATE ZONING SERVE DIFFERENT ASK PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT AS A COASTAL CITY. THE ABILITY TO GO ABOVE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS DEFINITELY ALSO CREATES A LOT OF ANGST WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. WELCOME HANG IF YOU LIKE WE WELCOME BACK WITH US. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE BALKANS OFFICER TO BE AFTER THE SEIZE UPON DEL THOUSAND OAKS IN TORRANCE WILL SIMPLY ECHO THE COMMENTS AROUND THE PARKING ISSUE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. YOU SO MUCH WE LIKELY TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME. FOR THIS IS GONNA BE OUR LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION. WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO BE A TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. PLEASE SENATE BILL WOULD SOMEBODY BUILDS A UNIT THEY COULD PUT AS MANY PARKING SPACES AS THEY WANT RIGHT. YES ALTHOUGH I DO WANT TO DRESS A PARKING FOR SECOND SO WHAT WHAT WHAT THIS BILL SAYS IS THAT. WITH REGARDS TO SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING OR SUPPORT OF HOUSING -- THAT'S WHERE WE'RE SAYING WE DON'T THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT MUCH PARKING AND THAT'S THE REALITY OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. THAT'S TRUE THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE SO MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE OPPOSITION IS THAT THEY WANT TO ENSURE PARKING FOR THOSE PARTICULAR PROJECTS. THAT IS ONE WHERE WE JUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR PARKING IN THOSE SITUATIONS AGAIN FOR SPECIAL NEED HOUSING AND SUPPORT HOUSING ALONE BUT I I THINK WITH THE IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION ON THOSE TWO ITEMS. UNDERSTANDING THERE'S SOME -- DIFFERENCES BUT THIS IS NOT TOUCH THE ISSUE OF PARKING OTHERWISE FOR WRECKED SO I THINK THAT'S CORRECT OVER V. ONE TO BUILD SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S NOT SUPPORT OF HOUSING. CORRECT BUT IT WOULD NOT THEIR CHOICE YES YES SOMEONE EXACTLY THAT PENCILS -- THEY DO IT THAT WAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER ABOUT. WE WOULD WELCOME ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION OR MOTION FROM THE COMMITTEE. OCEAN A MOTION ON THE FLOOR BY SENATOR BAIL.

THAT IS MANY REGIONS ARE INTERESTED CAN PARTICIPATE -- IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AT THIS BILL INTENDS TO PROVIDE. MEMBERS AT FOURTEEN THIRTEEN SEEKS TO ALLOW -- SUBREGIONS -- THE BENEFIT. OF A NEW INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS SHOULD THEY VOTE TO CHOOSE TO DO SO -- DISRUPTING THE CURRENT NARRATIVE OR A SMALL GROUP OF FOLKS -- CAN TAKE AN ENTIRE MEASURE UNDER THIS BILL IT'S A FUNNY MEASURES APPROVED BY THE REQUIRED NUMBER VOTERS COMMUNITIES WILL BE ENSURED THAT THE DECISION TO TAX THEMSELVES WOULD NOT BE IN VAIN. AND AS THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE SALES TAX WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITIES DEVOTED TO TAX THEMSELVES -- WITH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY ARE REPRESENT IS THE SACRAMENTO AREA COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. AND OUR PARENTS EVEN HERE IN TIME TO THE NECK EXPEDITE THIS PROCESS SO I'LL TURN OVER THEN IF I MAY NAY THANK YOU SO MUCH WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TODAY WE LOVE IT WHEN THE CDC IS HERE. THE POLICE WHO WOULD LIKE TO DEDICATE THIS OFF. MR MEMBERS MIND JAMES CORAL ST THE EXACT DIRECTOR OF THE SACRAMENTO AREA COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS ARE SAY CALLED WE REPRESENT THE SIX COUNTY GREATER SACRAMENTO REGION TWENTY TWO CITIES. ALSO ON BEHALF OF OUR PARTNER THE PLASTER COUNTY TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AGENCY OUR BOARD IS IN SUPPORT FULL SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE -- AT WHICH EMPOWERS LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITIES WITH EXISTING -- TAXING FOR TO CREATE THE SUB COUNTY TAXING DISTRICTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY SO CRITICAL. I WANT TO GIVE YOU THREE REASONS WHY THIS IS REALLY REALLY VITAL TO THE FUTURE OF OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION AND FRANKLY OF THE STATE. FIRST IS THAT THE FUTURE OF TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IS ABOUT LEVERAGE IF WE DON'T ACTUALLY BRING MONEY THE TABLE LOCALLY -- WE'RE GOING TO LOSE OUT ON FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS INCREASINGLY FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDS ARE ABOUT LOCAL LEVERAGE AND SALES TAX DOLLARS ARE WHERE THAT SITE NUMBER. ONE SECOND YES THIS IS ABOUT DRAWING SMALLER SUB DISTRICTS. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT AN EVEN BIGGER MUCH LARGER PLAY WHICH IN OUR CASE IS THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MEGA REGION OR A REGIONAL ECONOMY -- THIS WILL HELP DO THINGS LIKE THE EIGHTY SIXTY FIVE INTERCHANGING PLASTER COUNTY THE THIRD TRACK WHICH CONNECTS ROSEVILLE TO SACRAMENTO TO THE BAY AREA WE ARE INCREASINGLY A MEGA REGIONAL ECONOMY. THE EIGHTY IS THE ONLY ALL WEATHER CROSSING THIS YEAR INTIFADA'S THAT'S GOODS MOVEMENT ALL THE WAY TO CHICAGO SO EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A IN OUR REGION THIS WOULD BENEFIT PLASTER COUNTY IT REALLY IS A MEGA REGIONAL. THING TO BENEFIT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PAY THE WHOLE FREIGHT BUT THAT DOWN PAYMENT IS CRITICAL AND THIRD. I HAVE MET PEOPLE AND I'VE MET A FAMILY RECENTLY THAT WANT TO MOVE THE LINCOLN CALIFORNIA GREAT QUALITY OF LIFE GREAT SCHOOLS THEY DECIDED NOT TO MOVE TO LINCOLN. BECAUSE OF THE EIGHTY SIXTY FIVE INTERCHANGE WE ARE LOSING OUT ON PEOPLE WERE LOSING OUT ON GROWTH AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IF WE DON'T GET MEASURES LIKE THIS THIS IS HOW IMPORTANT THE SAYS -- BIG LIST OF STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING LOCAL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE HOUSING ADVOCATES CIVIL ENGINEERS AIR QUALITY PROPONENTS PLANNERS AND MANY OTHER PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS OUR BOARD DOES NOT TAKE TAX MEASURES LIGHTLY -- WE DON'T APPROVE ALL OF THEM BUT WE ARE FULLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE TODAY.

THIS WAS THE ISSUE WITH PLASTER COUNTY THEY PUT A SALES TAX ON THE BALLOT A FEW YEARS AGO AND IT FAILED. SO NOW WE'RE COMING BACK AND WE'RE PICKING AND CHOOSING WHO ARE VOTERS ARE. WE ARE AUTHORIZING SALES TAX ON A PORTION OF THE ELECTORATE. AND THE UNIFORMITY MEMBERS BEYOND THEIR AGGRESSIVE AUTHORIZATION THAT I'VE MENTIONED WITH OTHER BILLS TODAY IT'S THE UNIFORMITY HERE THAT WE HAVE THE BIGGEST ISSUE WITH FROM BUSINESS COMPLIANCE STANDPOINT WHICH IS WHY CAL TAXES ALSO OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE. AUTHORIZING SMALLER SALES TAXES ACROSS REGIONS MAKE COMPLIANCE VERY DIFFICULT SALES TAXES COULD DIFFER ORDERLY FROM STREET TO STREET HAVE A MEASURE LIKE THIS IS TO GO THROUGH. THE TAX DISPARITIES ARE HUGE PROBLEM HERE IT IS GOING TO IMPACT CONSUMER BEHAVIOR -- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN PLASTIC COUNTY AND OTHER REGIONS SO FOR THOSE REASONS BEYOND THE REGRESSIVITY -- WOULD ASK FOR NUMBER.

THERE I'VE HEARD OF PLACES WHERE THIS COULD BE A VERY GOOD IN THIS IMPORTANT IN THE SET NECESSARY BILL. THE QUESTION IS ARE THERE STATE POLICY AREAS THAT WERE THIS WOULD OPEN UP THE GATES AND WE THINK THAT THAT IS INVOLVED SAY WITH A A OR B. ISSUES IT WITH THIS MASSIVE IN A DEVELOPMENT A ENABLING. THE ACTION HERE. BUT ALSO IT IS HAPPEN SO SOON AFTER THE RECENT THE FAILURE TO PASS THAT THEY SPEND A MILLION DOLLARS TRYING TO DEFEAT IT IT DIDN'T WORK. SO WE'LL COME BACK TO THE THE CHANGING THE RULES AT THIS POINT -- WE THINK IT IS JUST IS NOT AN ADVISABLE SO IT IS NOT ADVISABLE SO -- WE HAVE A MAP TO SHOW THE ISSUES AT A FOR ANYBODY INTERESTED IN TO SHOW THEM THE PROJECT LIST THAT WOULD BE BACK ON NEXT YEAR. WHICH WE THINK RAISES A NUMBER STATE POLICY QUESTIONS AND WHAT THIS WILL ENABLE. IN OUR COUNTY. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE WERE IN HEAVY HANG WITH US IN CASE WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS VERY.

THESE ARE WISER -- ORANGE COUNTY IS A SELF HELP. DOWNEY FURRY TO TIRE COUNTY MEASURE M. -- AND I IT IS JUST SAID IT BILL SAYING HEY OF THE THIRTY FOUR CITIES. IF WE DID NOT HAVE SELF HELP WE COULD SELECT THE CITIES THAT WOULD PARTICIPATE. IN TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS. AND THOSE WITH. THEN BENEFIT FROM THAT SALES TAX AND THE OTHERS WOULD NOT. YES THE WAY THIS IS GOING TO BE FOCUSES ON JUST TO COUNTIES IS THE WAY THE BILL READS IS CAN BE FOCUS ON SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND PLASTER COUNTY. AND WE WANTED TO INSURE SO JUST BEING VERY CANDID AND AND DO APPRECIATE. THE MAYOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS ISSUE. IS THIS NUMBER ONE IS THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE CONTIGUOUS JURISDICTIONS. SO WE CAN -- WHAT WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING IS IF WE'RE TAKING SPECIFIC SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN AN UNINCORPORATED AREA? IN WHAT THE OPPOSITION WHEN THEY POINTS WERE BROUGHT UP TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHO PAYS WHAT LEVEL OF TAX WOULD BE A CHALLENGE. WHICH IS WHY WE SAID LET'S FOCUS ON CONTIGUOUS CITIES SO MAKING THIS UP. THERE WOULD BE EIGHT CONTIGUOUS CITIES WITHIN. THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO. THEY WOULD BE THE ONES THAT WOULD ASSESS THEMSELVES FOR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS. IT WOULD BE THE ONES THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SEE THE BENEFIT SINCE THEIR PAIN INTO TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT MEASURE. OTHER REGIONS WERE NOT PART OF THAT CONDUCTING TO U. S. FOCUS AREA WOULD NOT. I'M IN SAME THING WOULD BE GOING FOR PLACER COUNTY SO IT WOULD BE ONE CITY. FOR CONTINUOUS CITIES LOCATED ACCOUNT. I AND AT THIS TIME. THIS BILL WOULD HAVE AUTHORIZED. AUTHORIZING LANGUAGE JUST TO COUNTIES SAN DIEGO PLASTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

ORANGE COUNTY LIKE MUCH OF OUR STATE MASTER FIRST FIRE WATER PORTFOLIO IN ORDER TO PREPARE FOR NEXT ROUTE. AND TO LESSEN OUR DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTED WATER IN OANGE COUNTY IN PORT AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE IS THE SOUTH COAST WATER DISTRICTS TO HIM THE OCEAN DESALINATION PLANTS. THE PROJECTS A WIN WIN AND MY BILL AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY TWO WILL ENABLE US TO BRING IT TO FRUITION. CURRENT STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO PROCEED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EXPIRES ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY TWO WILL EXTEND THE STATUTORY TIMELINE IN ABLE TO ENSURE THE STATE AT FINING AND COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT. PLEASE TO HAVE WITH ME TODAY RICK CAN TALK TO THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE SOUTH COAST WATER DISTRICT WILL PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. ABOUT THE PROJECT [inaudible] RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY WITH ME TODAY IS OUR BOARD PRESIDENT BILL GREEN SPECTER. AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN PETRIE-NORRIS INDICATED THE DOUBLE MEANING OCEAN D. CELL PROJECT WILL BE A DISTRICT OWNED. ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE DROUGHT PROOF WATER SUPPLY PROJECT. THE PROJECT WOULD SERVE THE SOUTH COAST WATER DISTRICT AND INTERESTED PARTNERS IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY. AN AREA THAT'S ROUGHLY 90% DEPENDENT ON IMPORTED WATER FROM THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF CAL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. FURTHERMORE THE PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE A CONTINUOUS EMERGENCY WATER SUPPLY DURING AN EARTHQUAKE. IN AN EARTHQUAKE INDUCED IMPORTED WATER OUTAGE AND COULD PROVIDE THE MUCH NEEDED FIRE FLOWS AFTER THAT OUTAGE. ON THE WILDLAND FIRE FRINGES THE WILD LAND FRINGES IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY. THE PROJECT ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REGIONAL WATER SOLUTION REDUCING DEPENDENCE ON THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND THE COLORADO RIVER ACCIDENT. THE SLANT WILL TECHNOLOGY AND A CO MINGLED BRINE WASTEWATER DISCHARGE COMPONENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE OCEAN PLAN AND ARE ACTUALLY THE PREFERRED REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL APPROACH. THROUGH THIS BILL WE'RE MAKING SIX A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT THAT CALIFORNIA ORGANIZED LABOR IS INVOLVED IN THIS CONSTRUCTION. WE WILL HAVE A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT AND PREVAILING WAGES WILL BE PAID. ODJICK HAS RECEIVED BROAD SUPPORT BY THE LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS CERTIFIED THE E. I. R. ON JUNE TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY NINETEEN AND WE ARE STARTING THE PERMITTING AND CONTRACTED ELEMENT PROCESS. WITHOUT THIS SPECIAL LEGISLATION WE WILL LOSE OPPORTUNITY AND ABILITY. TO DELIVER THE PROJECT AS A DESIGN BUILD OPERATE OR THE OPERATOR IS THOROUGHLY INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS DESIGNED TO ENSURE IT ALL WORKS AT THE END OF THE DAY. WITHOUT THIS SPECIAL LEGISLATION THE PROJECT WOULD BE A TRADITIONAL DESIGN BUILD BUILD. A PROJECT DELIVERY THAT WOULD RESULT IN UNNECESSARY CHALLENGES AND RISKS. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE SLANT WELL AND THE OCEAN WATER TREATMENT PROCESS. LASTLY WE ARE AND OUR REGION HAVE BEEN AFFORDABILITY CEILING FOR THIS PROJECT. IF WE LOSE THE STATE GRANTS AND LOANS WE WILL LIKELY EXCEED THIS AFFORDABILITY CEILING WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE LOSS OF POTENTIAL PARTNER WATER AGENCIES.

THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME GET IN TROUBLE. WHEN YOUR BOSS AROUND? IF YOU MOVE THE TABLE GOOD AFTERNOON AND I DO APOLOGIZE -- IT HAD A BITTER KERFUFFLE IN A GEO IN ASSEMBLY. BUT GRATEFUL TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU AND WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO ITEM -- TURN OVER SOME NUMBER STONE ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN AB. TWELVE SEVENTY AND EVEN IN THE IN COMMITTEE THOUGH SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE YET. THIS IS IN THE MONEY COME ON UP AND WE'RE GONNA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR APPRECIATE YOUR WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. PLEASE FOR STARTERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESEN AB TALL SEVENTY AND FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING AS WITH US THROUGH THIS BILL AND CONFIRM THAT THAT THEY COMMITTEE MEN IT'S REGARDING THE INCLUSION OF GROSS RECEIPTS THAT DEFINITION. HAPPY TO TAKE THAT AND THE CLARIFICATIONS THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY THAT WAS NEVER THE INTENT AND SO PUTTING IN SOME LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT BEING APPLIED RETROACTIVELY IS ABSOLUTELY FINE. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS IS APPLYING. FALSE CLAIM STANDARD. TO TAX DISPUTES THE THERE'S THERE'S A TAX GAP IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE TWENTY BILLION TO TO TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND WHAT I MEAN BY TAX GAP IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAXES OWED. AND TAXES COLLECTED THAT NORMALLY THE TAXING ENTITIES DO A LOT OF THAT WORKING GO AFTER TAX SCOFFLAWS BUT THERE ARE CASES. WHERE AND USING THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THROUGH WHISTLEBLOWER STATUTES? GOES AFTER THOUGH THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO -- LARGE AMOUNTS OF TAX DOLLARS THAT HAVE NOT PAID THEM THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. IS MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE STRENGTHENING THE BOTH CLAIMS ACT TO PROTECT WHISTLEBLOWERS. GIVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL APPROPRIATE TOOLS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY GO AFTER TAX SCOFFLAWS. THAT'S WHAT THE BILL IS THAT AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I DO HAVE SOME MEMBERS OF THE TURNING GENERAL'S OFFICE HERE. TO GET SOME TESTIMONY AND ALSO BE PART OF ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND HOW THAT WORKS THANK YOU SO MUCH SOME EVER WE WELCOME OUR WITNESSES IF YOU COULD PLEASE GIVE US YOUR FIRST LAST AND AS WELL AS ORGANIZATION TITLE PLEASE. IN TWO MINUTES. HI I'M ANTHONY LIAM A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE EIGHTIES OFFICE AND WHERE. THEY TEASE PLEASE THE SPONSOR AB TWELVE SEVENTEEN IT'S AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROTECT PUBLIC DOLLARS IN COMBAT FRAUD AGAINST THE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WHEN A THING THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE? ECHO HIS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND SOME OF THE REMAINING CONCERNS. AND WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND OPPONENTS OVER THE LAST WEEK -- THAT ALLOWED US TO MAKE PROGRESS -- AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER -- ON THE REMAINING ISSUES AS THE BILL GOES FRWARD AN ATTENDANT OVER NOW TO MORE AND GO YET. THIRTEEN ANSWER IF YOU COULD PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MARTIN GORE YET SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA AG'S OFFICE I KNOW I LEAD THE FALSE CLAIMS UNIT IN OFFICE. AND WE SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN OUR ABILITY. TO A COMBAT TAX FRAUD. IS A FALSE CLAIMS LAW PROVIDES SOME UNIQUE PROVISIONS THERE WILL MOTOR VICE WHISTLEBLOWERS KNOW COUNCILS BRING CASES. OF VIEW INFORMATION THAT WE OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT EVIDENCE SO WE OTHERWISE DON'T GET. THE FALSE CLAIMS LAW ALREADY ALLOWS THESE KIND OF CASES IN OTHER IN ALL OTHER AREAS. IT'S BEEN VERY PRODUCTIVE. OUR UNIT HAS RECOVERED ABOUT A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I SHOULD ADD THAT WOULD COMPLETELY SELF FUNDED. OUT OF THE RECOVERY **** WE OBTAIN WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL SO FAR. I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND THIS TO THE TAX AREA -- IN WITH THAT. I HAVE BEEN ENTERING QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE READY FOR ALL THREE OF YOU HERE WE'RE GOING TO TURN OVER TO ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY BE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORTH THIS TIME PERSON LASSEN ORGANIZATION. LAST CALL FOR SUPPORT WE'RE NOT GONNA WELCOME ALL THOSE WHO MAY BE IN OPPOSITION. FIVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH WE WELCOME THE GENTLEMAN TO COME FORWARD. WOULD LIKE TO GET A KICKS OFF RIGHT. HEY THERE WE GO WELCOME TO COMMITTEE SIR FLOOR SOURCE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MIKE BELOW IT ON BEHALF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA -- MISTER LEWIS CORRECT WE'VE HAD PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE NARROWED THE ISSUES WE'VE KICKED AROUND SOLUTIONS. AND SO HE IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THIS IS A WEIGHTY BUILT THIS INVOLVES A MAJOR POLICY CHANGE IN THE LAW. THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT IN CALIFORNA WAS CREATED IN THE EIGHTIES IT HAS NEVER BEEN APPLIED TO TAX DISPUTES. BEFORE AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES RAISED BY THIS -- WELL LAID OUT IN THE ANALYSIS BY THE WAY -- THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT IS A MAJOR GOVERNMENTAL TOOL TO COMBAT CORRUPTION. IT IS MAJOR BECAUSE OF THE POWER INVESTED IN THE GOVERNMENT -- WE HAVE TROUBLE DAMAGES SO THE THRESHOLDS IN THE BILL ARE. GROSS OR NET INCOME OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE TAXPAYER AND A TAX DISPUTE OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO CONVERT A GARDEN VARIETY TAX DISPUTE INTO A FALSE CLAIMS ACT IS A VIOLATION IS A BIG PROBLEM. IF YOU HAVE A CREDIBLE BASIS FOR YOUR POSITION BUT LOSE YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SHORTED IN A TAXES. PLUS TREBLE DAMAGES THAT'S ANOTHER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND YOUR NOW 280-010-00 DOLLARS PLUS ATTORNEY'S FEES AND THERE IS A REFERENCE NOW TO DAMAGES INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES I DON'T KNOW WHAT CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES MIGHT BE IN A TAX CASE. BUT THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE ARE WORKING THROUGH AGAIN PRODUCTIVELY -- WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR INCLUDING THE RIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES TO USE PRIVATE COUNSEL. WHICH CHANGES THE CHARACTER OF THE TAX DISPUTE IT IS NO LONGER THE NEUTRAL TAX COLLECTION AGENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT YOU NOW HAVE A PERSON OR LAWYER WITH A PROFIT MOTIVE. AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING QUI TAM ACTIONS. OF WHERE YOU -- A PRIVATE CITIZEN CAN BRING THE ACTION -- ALLEGING A VIOLATION SO THERE ARE VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE LAW HERE AND IT HAS TO BE DONE RIGHT I KNOW MR MCHALE AND OTHERS HAVE OTHER ISSUES THEY'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. ON AND THE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON PREVENTING A GARDEN VARIETY TAX DISPUTE WHERE THE PERSON HAS SUBSTANTIAL AUTHORITY FOR THEIR POSITION. ADVERTING THAT INTO A FALSE CLAIMS ACT WE IS SIMPLY PUT TOO MUCH POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PUT THEIR THUMB ON THE SCALE HERE. SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THANK YOU SO MUCH AS WHAT REGRET FROM SOME KELLY GOOD AFTERNOON. YES -- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS A CHRIS MAKAYLA ON BEHALFOF THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND JUST BRIEFLY I WANT TO PUBLICLY STATE -- AS I DID PRIVATELY THAT WERE APOLOGETIC TO THE AUTHOR OF THE MEASURE FOR COMING IN LATE. IN OUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. A COUPLE OF THINGS THE FIRST IS WE KNOW THAT THIS IS PATTERNED AFTER A NEW YORK AND PERHAPS ILLINOIS STATUTES -- OTHER THAN THE ONE SUBSTANTIAL CASE CITED IN YOUR ANALYSIS. UNCLEAR AS TO HOW EFFECTIVE OR WHAT ITS UTILIZATION IN NEW YORKER ILLINOIS HAVE BEEN. THERE'S BEEN SOME PRESS STORIES IN THE ABOUT THE ILLINOIS STATUTE THAT SEEM HIGHLY CRITICAL OF IT. CALIFORNIA TAXI GIN SIS DO HAVE A A WHISTLEBLOWER PROGRAM IN OUR INITIAL THOUGHT IS WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE OUGHT TO CONSIDER FUNDING -- THE STATE'S WAS ABROAD PROGRAM WITH THE TO TAX AWARE THE TAX AGENCY'S THIS CD TFA NOW ON THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF TOOLS IN THE PROVERBIAL TOOL BOX. TO INSURE TAXPAYER COMPLIANCE WITH OUR TAX LAWS AND OF COURSE WE HAVE A PLACE SYSTEM HERE MEANING THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY THE DISPUTED TAXES FILE A CLAIM FOR REFUND. AND THEN LITIGATE FIRST ADMINISTRATIVELY AND THEN JUDICIALLY -- YOUR TAX DISPUTE -- I KNOW THAT THE PROPONENTS HAD MADE SOME STATEMENTS ABOUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO COLLECT MORE TAXES BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH OTHER SCA CLAIMS. HOWEVER YOUR ANALYSIS KNOWS THAT THE F. T. B. DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BILL SO I'M UNSURE HOW -- TO COUPLED WITH THOSE TO COINCIDE IF AT ALL. NOW TURNING TO THE LANGUAGE WE HAVE SEEN SOME DRAFT AMENDMENTS WHICH WE APPRECIATE FROM THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF. TO PUT SOME SIDE BOARDS ON IT I JUST LIKE TO RAISE A FEW OTHER ISSUES ON THE LANGUAGE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. ONE IS PERHAPS REQUIRING MORE THAN CONSULTATION WITH THE STATE AGENCIES BY THE AG OR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE TAX AGENCIES DESPITE SURE SOMETIMES MY CRITICISMS OF THEM DO HAVE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE TAX COUNSEL -- WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT EXIST IN THE AG'S OFFICE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO PERHAPS WE MIGHT WANT. TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST CONSULTATION. THE DEFINITIONS OF MATERIAL ALLAH T. AND THE ADDITION OF CONSEQUENCE ALL DAMAGES WHETHER YOU THINK IT'S A PROPER CODIFICATION OR NOT. WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERN THAT -- SECTION FOR THE BILL NOTES THAT THEY ARE DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW WE USUALLY DO THAT TO IMPACT PENDING LITIGATION AND I WOULD LEAST INQUIRE OF THE COMMITTEE. THE NECESSITY OF DOING SO IS MISTER BELOW MENTION THE DEFINITION OF PROSECUTING AUTHORITY. IN THE FIRST SECTION OF THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT. IS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE PRIVATE COUNSEL THERE'S NO INDICATION FOR EXAMPLE HOW WILL THEY BE PAID MANY CITIES DO UTILIZE OUTSIDE COUNSEL TO DO MUNICIPAL LITIGATION. USUALLY THEY'RE PAID ON AN HOURLY BASIS BUT WE DO KNOW OF INSTANCES WHERE THEY'RE PAID ON A CONTINGENCY FEE BASIS. WE WOULD PREFER TO SEE THEM ON AN HOURLY BASIS AND NOT A CONTINGENCY FEE CASE GOING AFTER A TAX DISPUTE THIRTY SECONDS OKAY -- THE THRESHOLDS YES ARE VERY VERY LOW A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR WAGE DISPUTE -- DOESN'T SEEM TO BE -- OF GRAVE CONCERN TO US ANY FRAUD IS BAD OF COURSE BUT WHEN WE PURSUED FOR EXAMPLE A SO CALLED TAX SHELTERS THEY WERE GENERALLY YOU KNOW MULTI MILLION DOLLAR THINGS. AND THEN THERE WAS A NOTE ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE BILL IS STRUCTURED BECAUSE YOU ALLOW. SECURING AUTHORITY TO GAIN ACCESS TO TAX RECORDS THAT WOULD INCLUDE OUTSIDE PRIVATE COUNSEL WE PREFER NOT TO HAVE THAT. AND THEN LASTLY PERHAPS IF YOU DO WANT TO MOVE FORWARD IS TO GIVE SOME CONSIDERATION OF A SUNSET DATE THANKYOU MATT MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS SPECULATE GONNA HAVE YOU GUYS JUST HANG THERE -- IF YOU DON'T MIND AND THEN WE'LL SEE IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE WE WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY BE IN OPPOSITION. BUT HEALTHY MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL GLAD FILLED THE ON BEHALF OF THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA AND ALSO THE ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS -- WE REMAIN OPPOSED BASED ON THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE PREVIOUS WITNESSES THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. HEY COULD YOU SEE CANCER SYRIANS CHAIR A RUG MUNCHER FROM CAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE REMAIN OPPOSED WHO WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS THE THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE THREE CHANNELS OFFICE FOR THE EXTENSIVE ENGAGEMENT WE'VE HAD AND WE THINK IT'S BEEN A GOOD PROCESS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S A CONVENIENT. IT'S YOUR TURN SENATORS KEVIN GOAL TO CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION AND OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON -- BENTLEY ON BEHALF OF CAL TAX THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- WE JUST THINK THAT THE TRANSIT AUTHORITY THAT IS DUPLICATIVE AND UNNECESSARY ALSO THE COUNCIL STATE TAXATION WAS IN ATTENDANCE EARLIER THIS MORNING BUT IS UNABLE TO BE HERE AND THEY WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION. TO SLEEP GRATEFUL. THANKS VERY DO A LAST CALL LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO OPPOSE IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME. FOR CURRENCY NINE WOULD LIKE TO RETURN BACK OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO MEMBER BLOOM LOOK AT AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY I THINK THERE ARE ISSUES THAT YOU WERE COMMITTED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON IN YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE AND LIKE TO BE ABLE. TO GIVE YOU SOME TIME TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND. TO THOSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSE AND WE'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP. FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. SURE WE ARE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TRY AND THERE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS IN FACT SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN WERE TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GO AFTER LEGITIMATE TAX DISPUTES AND WERE HAVING CLARIFIED THAT I I WILL ADMIT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP. TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THEM. BUT I DO WANT TO COMMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL LOT OF CITIES DO HAVE THEIR CITY ATTORNEY IS AN OUTSIDE COUNSEL. AND THERE'S NO PROHIBITION AGAINST CITIES SEEKING REDRESS ON A CONTINGENCY BASIS IN FACT THAT THAT DOES HAPPEN SO I'M. THAT'S PART OF THE THE EXISTING SYSTEM AND A LOT OF WE DO PROTECT IN THIS CASE IF A KEY TâM. PLAINTIFF DOES COME FORWARD IN THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T TAKE THAT UP THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ACCESS TO ANY OF THE CONFIDENTIAL TAX RECORDS WE'VE MADE THAT VERY CLEAR. OUTSIDE COUNSEL TO A CITY WHO IS PURSUING TAX FRAUD SHOULD ABSOLUTELY HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE RECORDS BUT THAT IS BEING HELD AND IN THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTACT AND THERE ARE. PROTECTIONS BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT THROUGH THIS MECHANISM THAT INFORMATION THAT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF EVEN OF A TAX. FRAUD VIOLATOR TO TO NECESSARILY BE PUBLIC THOSE THOSE RECORDS ARE. ARE TO BE PROTECTED. SO WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FRAMING THIS IN THE WAY THAT HE'S ABLE OF GIVING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE ABILITY TO GO AFTER TAX FRAUD. CLOSE THAT TAX GAP HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THE LIMITS THAT THAT YOU AND I IT TOOK DISCUSSED EARLIER. AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY MAKE SENSE IN THIS CONTEXT ALTHOUGH FUNDAMENTALLY IF SOMEONE IS THE FRAUD IN THE STATE. AT THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR LEVEL OF THE TWO MILLION DOLLAR LEVEL. AS TAXPAYERS WE SHOULD ALL. ACTUALLY BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. BUT GIVEN THE PENALTIES THE PENALTIES ARE IN INTENTIONALLY STRICT ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND THAT THE TOOLS. CAN BE EFFECTIVE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY TIES I WOULD NEVER QUESTION WAS RAISED ABOUT NEW YORK STATE. THERE IS SOME PRELIMINARY INFORMATION ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NEW YORK WE LOOKS LIKE THAT IS EFFECTIVE AND I THINK THE AG HAS THAT INFORMATION AND CAN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. FOR SURE SIR WHY NEW YORK. IN TWENTY TEN NEW YORK ENACTED. A VERY SIMILAR A STATUTE UPON WHICH WERE BASING THIS AMENDMENT -- THEY HAVE COLLECTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS UNDER THEIR FALSE CLAIMS XSTRATA STORY. AS A COMMITTEES A SUMMARY INDICATES -- DAVID THE LARGEST SETTLEMENT WAS A THREE AND A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT WITH SPRINT -- SO THEY'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. SO WE'VE FOLLOW THEIR PATTERN BUT WE'VE MADE SOME WHAT WE THINK OR SOME IMPROVEMENTS. OF FOR CALIFORNIA. OUR STATUES ENTRY MORE RESTRICTIVE ON WHAT THE PRIVATE LAWYER A KEY TâM CAN DO. UNLIKE NEW YORK WE SPECIFICALLY PUT IN A PROVISION THAT SAYS THE PRIVATE. PLAINTIFF CANNOT GET ACCESS TO THE TAXING AUTHORITIES RECORDS. WE ALSO HAVE PLENTY OF AUTHORITY UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT IN THE EXISTS. THE CABIN IN THE WORK OF A PRIVATE PLAINTIFF OR A A PRIVATE LAWYER. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO GET THE CASE DISMISSED. WE CAN FORCES SETTLEMENT. WE CAN LIMIT THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCEEDINGS. AND OUR EXPERIENCE. IS THAT WE WILL EXERCISE. THOSE REMEDIES MEANS WE DON'T WANT. OUR BOSS CLAIMS ACT WHICH WE USE ALL THE TIME WE DON'T WANT THAT TO BE USED FOR HARASSMENT. HELLO WE RESIST THAT I SHOULD SAY THAT -- UNDERSTANDING FROM NEW YORK AND IS A PRACTICE THAT WE WOULD FOLLOW. IS THAT IT THEY MAKE IT CLEAR IF IT WASN'T ALREADY THAT IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS CONSULTING WITH THE TAXES SORRY. AND CONCLUDES THE CASE LACKS MERIT. DECLINES THE CASE THAT SENDS A VERY STRONG SIGNAL TO PRIVATE COUNSEL -- TTM WHO ARE AFTER ALL PROFIT MOTIVATED BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE ENGINE OF THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT. IT SENDS A SIGNAL TO THEM THAT THEY SHOULDN'T SPEND ANY MORE MONEY CASE IN CASE THERE'S NOT GOING TO GET ANYWHERE. AND WE'VE BEEN -- PRETTY SUCCESSFUL DISCOURAGING PEOPLE UNDER THE ACT AS IT EXISTS. AND WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT WOULD. BE THE CASE. WITH TAX AUTHORITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER QUESTIONS COMES WITH SEMESTER. OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] TENER. LIKE TO SEE IF -- CENTER IF YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE ARE. WORKING ON IN LIGHT OF THE OPPOSITION BUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS REALLY VERY CLEAR GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TAX DOLLARS THAT ARE OUT THERE ON COLLECTED. I THINK WE OWE IT TO ALL THE TAXPAYERS WHO ARE PAYING TAXES APPROPRIATELY TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COLLECT THEM. AT THE PENALTIES OF SEVERE THE PENALTIES ARE SEVERE FOR TAX FRAUD WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THROUGH THE AMENDMENTS AND WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE SETTING. APPROPRIATE LEVELS AND EXCLUDING. VIEWS SO THAT THERE'S NOT A THREAT OF USING A PROVISION LIKE THIS AS AN UNWIELDY HAMMER. FORCE FOR A LEGITIMATE TAX DISPUTE BUT ONCE IT'S DETERMINED THAT THERE HAS BEEN TAX FRAUD. WE SHOULD BE ALLOWING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GO AFTER THAT TAX FRAUD IN THE PENALTIES SHOULD BE SEVERE BECAUSE OF THE OVERALL WHAT IT COSTS TAXPAYERS WOULD COST ALL OF US WHEN THOSE WHO ARE NOT PAYING TACK WHO ARE -- TAXES ARE NOT PAYING THEM AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I'VE THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A MEMBER -- IS THERE A MOTION TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THE SIDE OF NUMBER WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS BILL FOR THE MOMENT. I WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS COMING WE WILL ADVANCE EMOTION AN ITEM. THIRTEEN AB TWELVE SEVENTY THANK YOU WHEN I SAY THANK YOU RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH PLEASE THINK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S WELL AND THANK YOU TO OUR OPPOSITION.

WE'VE LOST -- 14%. OF BUTTE COUNTY'S HOUSING STOCK ALMOST FIFTEEN THOUSAND HOMES. ARE OF WE'VE FALLEN SEVENTEEN PLACES MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY ON THE AFFORDABILITY INDEX. SO WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH HOUSING IN THE REGION AB FOR THIRTY WOULD PROVIDE A MINISTERIAL APPROVAL PROCESS FOR HOUSING. IN CITIES WITHIN THE CAMP FIRE REGION -- AND SO -- IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE DONE THIS OTHER LEGISLATION OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION INCLUDING SB THIRTY FIVE FROM A COUPLE YEARS BACK -- BUT IS FOCUSED ON TRYING TO STREAMLINED HOUSING PROJECTS. IN THE AREAS AFFECTED BY THE CAMPFIRE -- LOT OF DIFFERENT RESTRICTIONS ON THIS THAT I THINK MAKE SURE THAT IS GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE GROWTH -- BUT THE WAY TO SUM IT UP IS THIS BILL. PROVIDES THAT WHERE WE'VE PLANNED FOR HOUSING IN OUR GENERAL PLANS IN OUR ZONING. LET'S BUILD IT. SO THAT WE CAN GET MUCH NEEDED HOUSING IN OF ALL LEVELS -- TO PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED I THE FUTURE.

I WILL THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS MY NAME IS MATTHEW BAKER WITH THE PLANNING CONSERVATION AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY HERE TO OPPOSE THIS PROPOSAL TODAY. TWO MINUTES -- TURNING CONSERVATION LEAGUE HAS GREAT SYMPATHY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE CAMPFIRE AS WE DO WITH ALL THE COMMUNITY STRUCK BY. INCREASINGLY DEVASTATING FIRES A RECENT YEARS AND WE ARE ERY COMMITTED. TO IDENTIFYING THE APPROPRIATE STREAMLINING MECHANISM -- ERROR PROCESS FOR ACCELERATING RECOVERY IN THESE COMMUNITIES WHICH COULD INCLUDE. A SEQUEL STREAMLINING MECHANISM -- WE DID NOT THINK THAT THIS IS THE CORRECT APPROACH. WE CAN THEN DISCUSS WITH THE APPROPRIATE THREE MONEY MECHANISM IS -- BUT WITHOUT SUCH A PLAN WE ARE HERE NO VOTE. AS RECENTLY AS LAST YEAR WE WORK IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE SANTA ROSA RECOVERY BILL -- TWO TWO SIX SEVEN THAT BILL BY COMPARISON WAS ONLY EXPEDITED -- JUDICIAL REVIEW NOT A FULL SEQUEL EXEMPTION IT HAD STRONG INFILL CRITERIA IT HAD STRONG TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY METRIC FOR FOR V. M. T. NGH G.. IT HAD EXPLICIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS AND AN ANTI DISPLACEMENT PROTECTIONS -- THESE ARE ALL SIMILAR THINGS TO SB -- THIRTY FIVE WHICH IS SET THE STANDARD FOR MINISTERIAL APPROVAL -- THIS BILL WE ARE HAPPY THAT IT HAS BEEN INCLUDED TO HAVE THESE EXCLUSIONS OF SENSITIVE AREAS. AND WE APPRECIATE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE TO THAT AND WE DO NOT THINK THAT THAT IS ENOUGH -- BEYOND THAT IS JUST REALLY GENERALLY -- GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY THAT WOULD BE. THE WOULD GOVERN THE VERY SWEEPING SEQUEL EXEMPTION. AND GENERAL PLANS JUST SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE KIND OF SPECIFICITY. TO TO IDENTIFY PERSONAL SPECIFIC IMPACTS OR REGIONAL ACUMINATE IMPACTS AND QUESTIONS OF INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER THEY'RE CORRECT INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN PLACE -- GENERAL PLANS ARE NOT FISCALLY CONSTRAINED THE WAY REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DARN OR ARE THEY A CONSTRAINT TO THE GHG REDUCTION MANDATES FOR REGION'S. THREE SEVENTY FIVE THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE IN CONSIDERATION OF WITH A RECOVERY PLAN AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING THE FURTHERMORE THE MOST IMPORTANTLY. TWO TWO SIX SEVEN DID HAVE A PLAN. OF WE HAD MAPS WE HAD A DEFINITIVE PLAN IN PLACE FOR WHERE THESE INVESTMENTS WOULD GO AND THEY WERE CONSISTENT WITH A ALREADY APPROVED. COMMUNITY VETTED MASTER PLAN FOR THE DOWNTOWN SANTA ROSA AREA. WE STRONGLY URGE THE AUTHOR TO GO BACK. TO THESE COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOP. SUCH A PLAN WITH YOU KNOW CROSS JURISDICTIONAL COOPERATION ROBUST COMMUNITY INPUT. TO ENSURE THAT THIS PLAN. NOT ONLY PROVIDE FOR THE HOUSING NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY BUT REFLECTS. THE OTHER DESIRES OF THE COMMUNITY FOR HOW THEY WANT THEIR COMMUNITY REBUILT. AND ALSO WOULD DEMONSTRATE ACHIEVEMENT OF STATE MANDATES FOR FOR GIGI AND EQUITY. AND AND WITH THAT WE WOULD SAY. PLEASE DEVELOP THIS PLAN AT THAT POINT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE STREAMLINING MECHANISM IS. WITHOUT THAT PLAN THE URGING OF THAT RESPECTFULLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME HANG WITH US IF YOU LIKE PLACER WELCOME PERSON LESS ORGANIZATION IN THE FOR SOURCE TWO MINUTES GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN ON WILL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF MY NAME IS RICHARD HERMAN I'M GENERAL COUNSEL. THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE CENTER. I'M APPEARING HERE THIS AFTERNOON ON BEHALF OF OUR ORGANIZATION. AND ALSO THE BUTTE ENVIRONMENTAL COUNCIL AND OTHER COALITION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER HERE TO OPPOSE AS WELL.

WILL COME BACK TO THAT I I HAVE THAT WRITTEN DOWN AND MAKE SURE NEVER COME SAGE AND ALSO WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT THE PLANNING CONSERVATION LEAGUES ANALYSIS AS WELL. WE THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. OUR FOCUS THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH IN THIS COMMITTEE IS LARGELY FOCUSED ON OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE'S BEEN NO FISCAL ANALYSIS DONE. OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARE. THE CIVIC LEE WITH RESPECT TO THE RATE OF GROWTH IN A RELATIVELY SMALL COMMUNITIES. IF YOU LOOK AT THE BILL ANALYSIS THAT WAS PERFORMED BY MS WONG FOR THE SENATE. ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE OF REVIEW. SHE ADDRESSED THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT. AND THAT IS IS THAT. IF YOU HAVE A VERY FAST RATE OF GROWTH WITH THE GENERAL PLANS BEING AS THEY ARE NONE OF THEM ANTICIPATED WHAT'S HAPPENED SO. TO THE EXTENT THE CHIU GENESIS THE RAY SHOULD RATE OF GROWTH AND THE BUILDING SPEED WHICH THE BILL IS INTENDED TO DO. YOU'RE GONNA SENSUALLY BLOW OUT THE GENERAL PLAN IN THE SMALL COMMUNITIES. SO THE COMMUNITIES ARE THEN GOING TO HAVE ADDITIONAL COST TO HAVE TO UPDATE AND REDO THEIR GENERAL PLANS WHICH IS NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL. SECONDLY WE DON'T THINK THAT THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION IS NECESSARY IF THERE'S PROPER INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND THIRDLY WHAT WERE LARGELY CONCERNED ABOUT IS IS THIS BILL IS DESIGNED. TO FAST TRACK SUBDIVISION -- DEVELOPMENTS OF FIFTY ACRES OR MORE CUMULATIVELY OR OTHERWISE. IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE COMMITTEE AT THE PREVIOUS HEARING THE SUBDIVISION MAP ACT WILL STILL HAVE TO BE COMPLIED WITH. AND IN THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL THE AUTHOR IS ADDED A HEARING PRIOR. TO THE APPLICATION FOR THIS STREAMLINED. OUR PROCESSES PROPOSED IN THE BILL. HOWEVER WITHOUT SICK BUT IT'S YOUR RELEVANT WITH SEQUEL IS NOT THE PROBLEM. AND THE STAFF REPORT FROM THE ENVIRONMENT QUALITY COMMITTEE ADDRESSES THAT. AND THE OTHER THING THAT THE COMMITTEE. ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS -- THANK YOU. THE OTHER THING THAT THE COMMITTEE ADDRESS WAS THE FACT THAT WITHOUT HAVING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW WHAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. COSTS WILL BE NOR DO WE KNOW THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND THE CUMULATIVE AIR QUALITY MEASURES MEASURES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO BE TAKEN SO WE REMAIN. OF TO AVAILABLE TO WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO MEET WITH THEM ON FRIDAY. BUT AT THIS POINT WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS IT'S AMENDED TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR BEING COMMITTEE TODAY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE YOU HANG THERE AND WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP FOR THOSE WHO RE ALSO OPPOSED IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD. LOOKING FOR YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME AN ORGANIZATION GOOD AFTERNOON MA'AM AND THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US ALL DAY DELAYS I'M GRACE MARVIN I'M A RETIRED SOCIOLOGY PROFESSOR. AND MY SPECIAL DEARY WAS COMMUNITY AND I'M NOW ON A COMMUNITY AND ACTIVISTS IN CONSERVATION ACTIVISTS. I'D RATHER THAN REPEAT. MANY OF THE ITEMS THAT WERE ALREADY LISTED I'M GOING TO JUST MENTION A COUPLE OF OTHERS THAT I WOULD LIKE. TO HAVE YOU. CONCERNED ABOUT AND THAT IS ONE MORE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SUPPOSEDLY NO COST ASSOCIATED WITH A. B. FOUR THIRTY IN ACTUAL FACT. THERE ARE TREMENDOUS INFRASTRUCTURE CLERICAL AND FIRE FIRE FIGHTING COSTS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS SOME FOR THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE REPAIRING AND EXPANDING ROUTES NINETY NINE AND THIRTY TO GET CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS WOULD HAVE TO BEAR SUCH COSTS UNDER. FOR THIRTY WITHOUT THE NECESSARY INPUT BY THE PUBLIC AND THEIR ELECTEDOFFICIALS. SUCH INPUT IS ESSENTIAL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN ASSESSING COSTS WATER SEWERS ROSE THAT WILL INEVITABLY ACCOMPANY THE URBAN SPRAWL THAT AB FOR THIRTY PROJECTS WILL. EMULATE MORE OVER THE BILL'S TOTALLY INSUFFICIENT REGARD AT THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND OF THE NEEDS OF LOW INCOME SURVIVORS OF THE CAMPFIRE WOULD RESULT IN. GREATER STATE AND LOCAL SUBSIDIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IF THERE IS NOT ENOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS CAMP FIRE VICTIMS THESE GOVERNMENTS WILL NEED TO DEAL WITH EVER GROWING AMOUNTS OF HOMELESSNESS. WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF SEQUEL LOCAL COMMUNITIES WILL NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE COSTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SUCH AS HARMS TO THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. AIR WATER PARKS AND PUBLIC HEALTH AS NOTED IN THE JUNE TWENTY NINTH. THE COMMENTS OF THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. THE BLANKET SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR NEW HOUSING WILL CONFLICT WITH EXISTING STATE POLICY AND LAW WE STRONGLY. OPPOSE THEM IN IRAQ TYPICALLY WHAT WE DO WHEN FOLKS ARE THIS SECTION IS THEY'LL GIVE THE FIRST AND LAST OKAY I IN I ONLY HAVE TWO SENSES. THAT'S OKAY AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS IS GOING TO ASK YOU HOW MUCH TIME YOU NEED AND WE'RE JUST GONNA ASK A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS HOPE WILL THANK YOU THINK OKAY. THE BLANKET SEEK WHAT EXEMPTION FOR NEW HOUSING WILL CONFLICT WITH EXISTING STATE POLICY AND LAW WHICH STRONGLY EMPHASIZES THE NEED TO REDUCE CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS IN CARBON EMISSIONS. AND FINALLY I'M ASKING YOU PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT AB FOR THIRTY WITH ITS MANY HIDDEN COSTS TO OUR COMMUNITIES STATE AND RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE WITH US THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MA'AM WOULD LET ME JUST ASK YOU BEFORE YOU GET STARTED. KEEP YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT A MINUTE MA'AM BUT THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE CAN OKAY PLEASE. YEAH I'M A LISBETH DEVEREAUX. AND I'M AN ARCHITECTURAL GLASS ARTISTS TO HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR FIFTY YEARS. ANAHEIM AN ACTIVIST AS WELL I WAS ON THE GENERAL PLAN TASK FORCE IN CHICO. AND ALSO STARTED THE CAR TO GO SUSTAINABILITY GROUP -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW JUST A FEW COMMENTS ONE IS THAT THERE. IS NO EVIDENCE YET THAT THE CAMP FIRE VICTIMS CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD THE HOUSING THIS PROPOSED. FOR EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY WE BELIEVE THIS NEEDS TO BE MORE DOWNS BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE DATA AND I THINK I'M WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE ON THAT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE ANALYSIS MADE. BEFORE GOES FORWARD. AND ALSO -- I THINK IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE LEGISLATURE'S REALLY FOCUSED ON CLIMATE CHANGE. AND CARBON EMISSIONS AND YOU. ALSO CALLED THIS EARLIER A CRITICAL ISSUE AND THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT WILL CREATE COMMUTER TRAFFIC. AND CARBON EMISSIONS WHICH CAN'T BE MITIGATED. SO THE IRONY OF THIS IS THAT IS CREATING MORE CONDITIONS WHICH EXASPERATED THE CAMPFIRE EXACERBATED THE CAMP HIKER. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I WOULD OPPOSE UNLESS THERE ARE AMENDMENTS MADE AND SOME FISCAL ANALYSIS THANK YOU SO MUCH ROOM VERY GRATEFUL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION AND I DO APOLOGIZE ARE MEAN INTERRUPTED MA'AM THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME INTERRUPT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SEE IF THERE IS. ANYONE ELSE WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. XENA WOULD LIKE TO COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I THINK JUST THREE ITEMS AND THEN I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO THE SOME NUMBER TO GET A COMMENT THAT I LIKE TO TURN OVER TO CENTER NIELSEN. AS I KNOW THIS IS CRITICAL FOR HIM. ON THE SUIT. I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY SIX IN INFANCY TAKE A LOOK AT I THINK THIS ASSEMBLYMEMBER TOOK. THREE OBVIOUSLY -- ADDING A PUBLIC MEETING -- IT ADVANCING REPORT -- TO P. R. -- NGUYEN THIS BILL IS UTILIZED AND IN THREE OBVIOUSLY COOPERATING WITH TRIBES IN FOCUSING ON TRAVEL RESOURCES AND I KNOW THAT'S THE ONE THAT'S INVOLVING YOUR CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE RENTAL OF THE WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH BUT PLEASE CONTINUE. YEAH I MEAN SO. MR HERMAN'S WELL AWARE IN THE LAST COMMITTEE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY WE TOOK THREE OF THEIR AMENDMENTS WE DID NOT TAKE THE OTHER. THREE AND WHAT I SAID I'M TAKING A MEMBERS I'M TAKING YOUR COMMITTEES. AMENDMENTS SO. IT NO NO NO ABSOLUTELY THAT I'M JUST GOING OVER THE ONES THAT WERE YEAH IF YOU. IN IN AN ENVIRONMENT QUALITY THOSE THE THREE THE I DISCUSSED SO THREATENS. AND CERTAINLY I CAN I CAN'T HELP BUT RESPOND TO SOME OF THE THINGS. YOU KNOW THAT WERE BROUGHT UP. PERSONAL APPRECIATE MR BUBBLERS CONCERN -- FOR OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND AND PLANNING PROCESS. I INTRODUCED THIS BILL EARLY IN THE YEAR. THEY JUST RECENTLY CAME ON IN OPPOSITION LAST WEEK EVEN THOUGH THE BILL'S BEEN IN PRINT. FOR MANY MONTHS NOW -- AND MAYBE IF IF THEY HAD TAKEN THE TIME. TO INVESTIGATE THEY WOULD KNOW THAT NUMBER ONE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES SINCE DAY. ONE SINCE THE CAMPFIRE -- STARTED AND THE AFTERMATH. WE CENTER NIELSEN AYE SENATOR DOLLY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ARE LOCALS AND THEY ALSO KNOW. EVERY SINGLE CITY AND COMMUNITY. THAT'S AFFECTED BY A BEFORE. THIRTY IS AN OFFICIAL SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- SO IN TERMS OF THE PLANNING THIS BEING. THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT. AND THAT'S WHY WERE INTRODUCED IN THIS BILL. ARE WORKING AND PEOPLE SEEM TO FORGET THAT THERE IS A GENERAL PLAN IN PLACE IN EACH OF THE CITIES. THAT WENT THROUGH A LOT OF SCRUTINY -- AND THAT PEOPLE HAVE MADE PLANS TO DO RESIDENTIAL GROWTH ALL LEVELS OF RESIDENTIAL GROWTH INFILL YES. MULTI FAMILY S. BUT ALSO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. AND I KNOW THE PEOPLE HERE FROM CHICO SEEM TO KNOW MORE ABOUT. WHAT PEOPLE IN PARADISE NEED APPARENTLY? MENTOR ART ARE HERE DETAINEE UNTIL IN THOSE PEOPLE THEY SHOULD LIVE IN DANCE. HOUSING OBVIOUSLY NOT KNOWING THAT NINE THOUSAND HOMES IN PARADISE WERE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. BY THE WAY -- AND ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO. IN THIS CASE IS REPLACE THE HOUSING STOCK THAT WE HAVE LOST THAT ALL LEVELS. I THINK THAT THE OPPONENTS IN THIS ROOM. DON'T LIKE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WELL THAT'S FINE MAYBE SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY LIVE IN THEM BUT THEY DON'T WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO HAVE A BUT THAT'S BEYOND BESIDES THE POINT. THAT DOES NEED TO BE PART OF THE HOUSING STOCK AND IT WILL HELP PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE REGION IN ADDITION. TO ALL OTHER LEVELS OF HOUSING THAT WORD AND IT WILL BE ALLOWED TO GO FORWARD IN A MINISTERIAL STREAMLINED PROCESS. PURSUANT TO THIS BILL. THIS DOESN'T ALLOW ANYBODY TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE GENERAL PLAN. IT DOESN'T ALLOW ANYBODY TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE ZONING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE COMMUNITIES. AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT BECAUSE THIS KEEPS GETTING. PRODUCT THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS GONNA LEAP FROG INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR THE THERE WERE YOU KNOW THEY WON'T BE ALLOWED TO BE THE PLANNING AND THE GENERAL PLAN YOU HAVE TO BUILD. AS AS ALL OF US IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT CAME OUT OF THE SNOW. DEVELOPMENT STILL HAS TO FALL ALL INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS OUTLINED IN THE GENERAL PLAN. IN OUTLINE THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. AND THEY START TO PAY ALL DEVELOPER IMPACT FEES ASSOCIATED THERE WITH. THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE THAT. ALL IT DOES IS TRY AND STREAMLINED PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY PLANNED. FOR IN THE REGION SO I APOLOGIZE MISTER CHAIR MAYBE GET. ME AN OVERLY BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PROTECTIONS IN THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE IT'S RESPONSIBLE GROWTH CONSISTENT WITH. LOCAL PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. AND IT IS A MUCH NEEDED THIS IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION IS AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION. WE'VE HAD AN ENTIRE TOWN DECIMATED IN LAS. AND WE KNOW THAT WE NEED HOUSING AND WE DON'T WE QUITE FRANKLY I DON'T HAVE TIME. HER NAME BE ISM. AND I DON'T HAVE TIME. FOR RADICAL PLANS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HELPING PEOPLE. REBUILD IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS DISASTER. WE HAVE WE DON'T HAVE WE CAN'T GO BACK. I'M LOSING PEOPLE RIGHT NOW I'M LOSING PEOPLE MOVING TO OTHER STATES I'M LOSING. EMPLOYERS IN OUR REGION ARE LOSING CRITICAL WORK FORCE AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY. IS DRASTICALLY AFFECT IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO. I THINK WE'VE BUILT IN AGAIN. MANY PROTECTIONS THAT ENSURE THIS IS. RESPONSIBLE GROWTH -- BUT WE NEED TO ENSURE A STREAMLINED PROCESS AND I WILL NOT ALLOW THINGS ARE GOING. TO TRY AND GET IN THE WAY OF THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THAT WE'VE HAD FOR THIS BILL THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS SEC PLUS SEVENTY PLUS VOTES IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND I ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE VERY STRONG SUPPORT HERE IN THE SENATE CERTAINLY FROM YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- AND I ENDED THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH JUSTIN NEVER WOULD LIKE TO TURN OVER TO SENATOR NIELSEN PLEASE. TURN IS HIS WENT EGGMAN TECHNOLOGY -- HARD WORK SIR. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH PARTY THANKS TO YOU AND OTHERS WHO OF WORK WHETHER. SOMEONE GALLAGHER AND I THROUGHOUT THE YEAR EVER SINCE THE FIRE. FOR CONSTRUCTIVE REBUILDING [inaudible] RELOCATING [inaudible] PREVENTION. THERE IS A NEW YOURSELF OF REPRESENTED A NEW BLAZED A TRAIL AND YOU HELPED US RAISE OUR TRADE. NOW I HAVE TO SAY AND I'M LOOKING RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THEM THOSE PEOPLE. WHO TESTIFIED HERE TODAY? I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MINUTES OR SECONDS ANY OF YOU EVER SPENT UP IN PARADISE. BEFORE DURING OR AFTER THE FIRE. I CAN ONLY ASSUME NOT MANY. AND I ALSO WISH THAT I COULD HAVE HAD A LOT OF THE PARADISE DISPLACED CITIZENS. SITTING HERE LISTENING TO YOU TODAY. WITH YOUR INSENSITIVITY CALLOUS DISREGARD. FOR THEM. THEIR FAMILIES THE FUTURES AND WHAT THEY LOST. AND SOME OF YOUR ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE FOR DECADES DONE EVERYTHING THEY CAN. TO ENCOURAGE THE ENORMOUS GROWTH OF FUELS AND ARE FORCED AND ON OUR WILD LAND SET OF RESULTED IN THESE FIRES. YOU WANT TO CALL IT GLOBAL WARMING IT STARTED A LONG LONG TIME AGO OVER FORTY MORE YEARS AGO. WITH CERTAIN POLICIES THAT PRECLUDED [inaudible] ANY CLEANING [inaudible] AND PROTECTIONS. THE FORCE IN THE WILD LANDS AND I'VE LISTENED TO YOU FOLKS HERE FOR DECADES. IN YOUR TESTIMONY. AND THE ARROGANCE TO THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TELL THEM HOW TO LIVE. WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOLD YOURSELF HOW TO LIVE? GREAT IDEAS THAT YOU HAVE. THE CONDITION SIR THAT YOU WOULD IMPOSE. PARADISE WILL NEVER GET BACK. I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER GET BACK TO TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND NO MATTER WHAT WE DO. BUT IT CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE DE POPULATED AS THE SEEMS TO BE DIRECTION YOU WOULD LIKE THEM TO GO. NO YOU SHAKE YOUR HEAD NO SIR BUT YOUR WORDS SAY DIFFERENTLY OKAY AND YOUR POLICIES. OF THE PAST [inaudible] A DIFFERENT. ALL WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH HERE. IS A CONSTRUCTIVE PLAN. IT IS SAFE FOR EVERYBODY. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT YOU THINK THAT RICH IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE LEAPFROG DEVELOPMENT. I GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW THAT RICH. YOU DON'T KNOW A LOT OF OUR AREAS THAT BURNED SO BADLY. AND I WISH BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR CONSCIOUS PRONOUNCEMENTS. THIS IS A GOOD WORD ARCHES PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT YOU GO OUT AND TAKE A LOOK. AND TALK TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE STILL SUFFERING? AND HAVING HORRIBLE DREAMS. OF WHAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED. AND THEN MAYBE CHANNEL RESOURCES TO HELP SOME OF US. DURING THE CONSTRUCTIVE WAY. TRYING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO REBUILD. THEY HAVE ECONOMIC HEALTH. TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN. TO LOCATE IN THAT AREA AGAIN. AND FIND EMPLOYMENT SOME DAY INSTEAD [inaudible] THE POPULATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN. PRIVILEGED HANG ON ONE SECOND. SIR I'M GONNA HAVE YOU JUST HANG ON ONE SECOND I WILL CALL ON YOU AND I PROMISE YOU THAT ALRIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH. LIKE TO BE TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE BEFORE WE GO BACK -- TO TESTIMONY. EIGHTY NINE SIR IF YOU DON'T MIND IS RECEIVING YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME IN OUR ORGANIZATION. YES PLEASE MISTER CHAIRMAN RICHARD HERMAN. I'M AN ATTORNEY HAVE BEEN PRACTICING LAW FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY YEARS I'VE REPRESENTED DEVELOPERS. MIKE A LITTLE CLOSER. I REPRESENTED I'M TRYING TO STAY CALM AND COOL BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE HEARING WAS SO INSTRUCTIVE TO THE TO ME THIS MORNING. HOPEFULLY I CAN ENGAGED TO THE CHAIR AND COLLEGIAL DISCOURSE WITH THE SENATOR HERE. WE'RE NOT HERE ON IDEOLOGICAL CAMPAIGN. WE'RE HERE'S ADDRESSING THIS PARTICULAR BILL AND THE REASON FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AND AS A STAFF REPORT FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE STATED HOWEVER WHETHER PARADISE RESIDENTS WILL RELOCATE TO THESE CITIES IS SPECULATIVE. AND IN THE MEANTIME OTHERWISE APPEARS TO BE A FREE PASS FOR DEVELOPMENT IN. THE AREA. THE RIGHT NOW WHAT ARE OBJECTION IS TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL IS THE LACK OF RECORD. EVIDENCE OF THE DATA ANALYSIS OR OTHER SUPPORT FOR THE CONCLUSION THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED SUCH A RAPID INCREASE IN GROWTH.% ANYWHERE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY LEFT SENATOR. AND THE EXPERTS ON THE ECONOMIC DISASTER ANALYSIS COMING FROM STATUS YOU MAY FROM CINEMA STATE. UNIVERSITY ARE THAT WITHIN ONE YEARS 50% OF MY GUN AND NEITHER THE SENATOR NOR THE ASSEMBLY MEN CAN CHANGE THAT. SO WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON IS THE DATA AND THE FACTS THAT SUPPORT. AN ILLOGICAL CONCLUSION THAT IS THE PREMISE FOR THIS BILL WE ARE NOT INSENSITIVE SENATOR I'M ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING PEOPLE FROM PARADISE SUING P. JEANNIE. I AND I CAN ASSURE YOU SIR WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I'VE INTERVIEWED MANY OF THEM AND I KNOW THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES THE POSTER EVAN DRAMATIC STRESS DISORDER HAVE YOU DELIGHT YOUR COMMENTS TO ME PLEASE I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR. BUT I I KNOW FROM I KNOW FROM HAVING TALKED WITH THEM AND THEN THE NUMBERS OF THEM THAT ARE ALREADY GONE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE MONEY. ARE ALREADY GONE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY PAID OFF MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE THEY'RE GONE THE PEOPLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AND THAT ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER IS A TRY ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY HOUSES ANYWHERE IN CHICO. NOW BACK TO CHICO ON THAT% PARTICULAR POINT CHICO HAS FIFTY EIGHT HUNDRED UNITS ALREADY TO GO IN THE PIPELINE. THAT UNDER OUR GENERAL PLAN IN CHICO WILL ACCOMMODATE THEM THEY DON'T NEED THIS BILL. TWO FIFTY HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT HUNDRED RIGHT THERE SO WHAT THE PREMISES THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE YOU APPROVE THIS BILL IS. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO BE SERVING HOW MANY REALLY NEED THIS STREAMLINED APPROACH WHAT'S REALLY AT RISK HERE? IS MASSIVE LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBDIVISIONS OF FIFTY ACRES OR MORE IN SMALL TOWNS THAT ARE GOING TO BE USING INFRASTRUCTURE THIS PAID FOR BY THE TAXPAYERS AND WHEN IT ISN'T THERE YOU'RE SHIFTING THE COST. OF THE DEVELOPMENT TO THE TAXPAYERS IN THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT THANK YOU SO MUCH WHAT I'D LIKE TO BE IN TO DO -- GENTLEMAN IS AT LIKE TO BE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM CENTER NIELSEN. I THEN WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE -- I HAVE A FEW QUICK COMMENTS IN ON INTERNET OVER TO THIS AND THEY WERE TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE. THEIR NIELSEN WITH THEIR THEIR ANY -- CLOSING TIMES YOU'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR LOOK HE HE HERE'S MY BOTTOM LINE ON THIS. NUMBER ONE THERE'S A SUNSET ON THIS ISSUE. IT IT'S UNCERTAIN. TWENTY TWENTY SIX REASON WHY THERE IS A SUNSET ON THIS ISSUES BECAUSE FOCUSING ON URGENCY. WE CAN'T JUST FOCUS ON PARADISE WHERE TO FOCUS ON THE REGION. ENTIRE REGION HAS BEEN IMPACTED. IN TRYING TO BE A TO KEEP. AS MANY FOLKS WITHIN THE REGION. TO KEEP THE REGION VIBRANT. I'M COUPLE OTHER ITEMS. THERE IS NO PRECLUSION. IN THIS BILL WILL NOT PRECLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM COLLECTING FEES IN WHAT WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE DO SEE ADDITIONAL STOCK BUILT. OF HOMES WHETHER MULTI FAMILY OR SINGLE FAMILY WE WILL SEE INCREASE FEES COLLECTED. THE OTHER CHALLENGE THE PARADISE HAS. WHEN IT COMES A MULTI FAMILY IS THEIR OWN FULL CONSUMERS AREN'T SEPTIC? CONCEPT TECH IS THE LARGEST CITY WEST MISSISSIPPI ON SEPTIC. SO THAT'S THE OTHER FOCUS THAT THE SOMEONE NUMBER IS WELL THE SENATOR HAS IS HOW TO BE ABLE TO BUILD -- WITHIN THE DOWNTOWN CORE -- HIGHER INTENSE -- THEY'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. PRIOR TO THE FIRE BECAUSE EVERYONE IS ON THE DAM SECT SEPTIC SYSTEM. SO THE STATE. WORKING WITH LOCALS DRIVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER DRIVEN BY THE SENATOR -- ALL FOCUS ON TRYING TO GET THAT SEWER WITHIN THE DOWNTOWN CORE SO WE'RE BUILDING SMART HIGHER IN CENTER. IN TRYING TO BE A TO CREATE THAT AFFORDABLE STOCK. AND THIS BILL CANDIDLY WILL BE ABLE TO HELP. THAT MULTI FAMILY HOUSING GET BUILT FASTER. UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS WITH IT -- THE IS A MEMBER THE SENATOR BEEN.-RESPONSIVE TO CHALLENGES SO FOR EXAMPLE CHICO THE ONLY PART OF THE BILL SHE GOES NO LONGER IN THE BILL -- IT'S ONLY FOCUS ON A FOR EXAMPLE OR BILL -- Là THOUGH GIVE THE CITY MORE THAN WILLOWS BIGGS GREATLY AND OF COURSE -- PARADISE SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO REDUCE TURNOVER THIS A MEMBER TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME CLOSING COMMENTS. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS SIR -- AND ALSO THE PASSION -- AND THAT IS GREATLY APPRECIATED AND YOU JUST WANNA IN THE HERE. CENTER NIELSEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK YOU'VE BEEN TIRELESS YOU'VE BEEN DOG -- IN CANNOT SAY THINKING OFTEN SO GRATEFUL TO WORK WITH YOU AND I'LL TURN OVER TO US IN OUR GALLAGHER TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE. IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AND ALL POINTS -- VERY WELL STATED -- TO TO MISTER HERMAN SPECIFIC POINT ABOUT. DATA. WE DO KNOW FOR A FACT FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THERE ARE TWENTY THOUSAND MORE PEOPLE LIVING IN CHICO TODAY. THAN THERE WERE PREVIOUS TO THE CAMPFIRE WE KNOW THERE'S 20%. MORE PEOPLE IN OR TODAY THAN THERE WERE PRIOR TO THE CAMPFIRE. THAT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY BUILT MORE HOUSING BY THE WAY OBVIOUSLY IT'S BECAUSE THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE REFUGEES. FROM THIS CAMP FIRE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE FEMA CAMP SITES. IN YUBA CITY. IN ORLAND [inaudible] IN GREATLY. FOUR HUNDRED UNITS ABOUT TO GOING TO GREATLY THIRTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE LIVING IN GRIDLEY. BUT ONLY FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS BECAUSE THAT'S ALL FEMALE GIVES YOU AS WE ALL KNOW WELL WELL NOW. SO WHERE THESE PEOPLE GOING TO GO. AFTER THE FACT IN WHERE THESE PEOPLE IN CHICO. GOING TO GO IF SHE GO DOESN'T WANT TO BUILD ANYMORE. WELL THEN WE NEED TO HAVE THE REST OF THE REGION HOPEFULLY BUILD MORE HOUSING NOW THERE ARE SOME SHOVEL READY POD PROJECTS IN CHICO HOPEFULLY THOSE WILL MOVE FORWARD -- THAT PROVIDE BOTH. APARTMENTS. MULTI FAMILY AND SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. THOSE OF ALREADY GONE TO A SEQUEL PROCESS AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL. MOVE FORWARD AND GET BUILT BUT WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE HOUSING IN IN THE REGION. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA SHOWS THAT WE NEEDED. AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO LEAVE IT AND MEAN THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK MAYBE IS A MAYBE THERE'S I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT I HOPE THERE'S NOT A DISAGREEMENT THERE BECAUSE WE WANT. TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THE REGION WE HAVE. THERE VITAL TO OUR WORK FOR SURVIVAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TEACHERS THE SYMBOL OF PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL. BELOVED PRINCIPLES JUST THERE FOR THE GRADUATION WAS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE HE IS LEAVING. BECAUSE HE CANNOT FIND HOUSING FOR HIS FAMILY AND GOING TO ANOTHER COMMUNITY WE'RE LOSING HIM I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN THAT'S WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I DO HOPE YOU WILL PASS THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- IS THERE A MOTION.

AND SECONDLY CLARIFIED -- CLARIFYING CHANGING COMMENT FOR OF THE ANALYSIS. IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE BILL. I PROMISE AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY FIVE ALL US CITIES TO STREAMLINE MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. THAT'S THAT MISSING MIDDLE THE FOLKS THAT DON'T QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIES HOUSING BUT CAN'T AFFORD THE CURRENT MARKET RATE. OF THAT TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT WITH THE WHEN CITIES DO NOT MEET THEIR RENEWED IT NUMBERS FOR THE SPECIFIC INCOME LEVEL THE MOTOR INCOME LEVEL. IF THAT'S THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE BILL ADDITIONALLY IT THE BILL WILL CLOSE LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE ARISEN SINCE SB THIRTY FIVE IMPLEMENTATION. WE'VE RECEIVED A LOT OF SUPPORT ON THIS BILL WE HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE NO VOTE TO DATE -- IN ANY OF THE COMMITTEES THAT WE'VE BEEN IN -- AND IT'S SUPPORTED BY A LOT OF DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE TURNER CENTER AT UC BERKELEY -- NOT PROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS OF A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- THE BUILDERS -- AND MANY OTHERS AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS -- EVERY THING FROM ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. TO LABOR UNIONS TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THE BASIC PREMISE IS THAT WE HAVE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING AT ALL INCOME LEVELS NOW WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE. WERE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES SHY -- AND I FEEL THIS IN MY DISTRICT OAKLAND BERKELEY RICHMOND ARE WITHIN A 43% INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING -- SO HOPEFULLY THIS BILL WILL HELP ALLOW FOR THAT MATTER INCOME HOUSING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AND MANY OTHERS ON THIS BILL.

BUT AGAIN I'M VERY PROUD TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON TO PRESENT TO ASSEMBLY BILL. SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE IT'S A PRIORITY BILL THE LATINO CAUCUS NOW AND A PRIORITY FOR THE MORE THAN NINETY THOUSAND FARMWORKERS -- THAT LIVE IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT AND SO THIS BILL. IS A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD AND ADDRESS SEEN OUR FARM WORKER HOUSING SHORTAGE. NOT ONLY IN THE DESERT I REPRESENT BUT IN CALIFORNIA. FARMWORKERS WITH OUR FAMILY FARMERS WORK TO BRING THE FRESHEST PRODUCE TO MARKET. AND CERTAINLY DO THEIR PART IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND HELPING FEET THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND LIKE MANY OTHER WORKING FAMILIES AND PROFESSIONALS IN OUR STATE TO BECAUSE OF OUR HISTORIC HOUSING CRISIS. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH AFFORDABLE AND DECENT PLACES FOR FARMWORKERS TO LIVE IN THE STATE. ACCORDING TO LOCAL CASE STUDIES SEVERAL LOCAL AND STATE WIDE NEWS REPORTS. FARMWORKERS CERTAINLY THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT ARE LIVING IN SUBSTANDARD AND APPALLING ABSOLUTELY APPALLING CONDITIONS. WE ARE FARMWORKERS LIVING IN GARAGES. TENTS VANS ABANDONED BUILDINGS. WE HAVE MULTIPLE FAMILIES LIVING IN THE SAME ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. AND ACCORDING TO A LOCAL FARMER HOUSING STUDY AN ACTION PLAN ON AVERAGE MORE THAN SEVEN PEOPLE SHARE A ONE BEDROOM UNIT. AND THAT'S JUST THE AVERAGE. SEVEN UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT JUST THE WORKERS THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S OUR CHILDREN AND IT'S THEIR EXTENDED FAMILIES. IN RURAL MONTEREY COUNTY THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT ONE IN TEN STUDENTS. THIS HOMELESS. AT TWELVE SCHOOLS THAT NUMBER IS ONE IN. FIVE AND AS I MENTIONED MANY TIMES THIS SITUATION -- IT'S A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS RIGHT HERE IN OUR OWN STATE WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL THE GOLDEN STATE. AS I INTRODUCED THIS LEGISLATION I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION. TO DO SOMETHING AND TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. AND THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. OFTEN PROGRAM A PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS BY WHICH DECENT. QUALITY FARM WORKER HOUSING IT'S BUILT. IT DOES NOT ADD ADDITIONAL RED TAPE FOR FARMERS INSTEAD. IT HELPS MAKE IT EASIER FOR FARMERS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO BUILD DIGNIFIED FAMILY FRIENDLY HOUSING. HOUSING FOR THE WORKERS WHO DESPERATELY NEEDED. SO THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS BUILT UPON STEP THEN PARTS OF THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE A PASSION ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I GREW UP AND FORMER HOUSING. IT WAS MY GRANDFATHER WHO WORKED AT ALMADEN VINEYARDS AND PISCINE THIS CALIFORNIA. HE WITH MY GRANDMOTHER MY MOM WAS A SINGLE PARENT THEY RAISED MY BROTHER AND I AND REFLECTING ON THIS EXPERIENCE NOW. REFLECTING ON WHERE I CAME FROM. HELLO I BEEN TOLD AS A CHILD. WHO WAS LIVING IN THAT FORMER HOUSING UNIT? LIVING IN OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS WITH TEN MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY. THAT ONE DAY I'D BE SITTING HERE SERVING IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE. WITH ALL OF YOU. I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED IT. BECAUSE I WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE. MY FAMILY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH. BUT WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE HAD A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS. OUR HOUSING WAS BASIC BUT A DECENT. AND OUR HOUSING COMPLEX WAS LOCATED RIGHT BESIDE THE VINEYARDS WHERE MY GRANDFATHER WORKED FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR SMALL FORMER HOUSING UNIT THEY GAVE OUR FAMILY THE OPPORTUNITY. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY FARMWORKERS THEN AND NOW. WE'RE NOT AND ARE NOT SO LUCKY. THIS BILL WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO WORK THE FEELS LIKE MY GRANDFATHER DID. AND IT'S GOING TO SERVE AS A TOOL. A TOOL TO HELP GET MORE PEOPLE THE HOUSING THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED. AND WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR CURRENT GENERATION OF FARMWORKERS THAT THEIR CHILDREN ALSO HAVE. THE CHANCE AT A BETTER LIFE AND A BRIGHTER FUTURE. AND I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY ONCE AGAIN MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL ESPECIALLY ON IN THE LAST FEW DAYS -- WITH THE QUICK TURNAROUND TO THE FOURTH OF JULY -- SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE STAFF AYE AYE I TRULY FEEL THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- THAT WE HAVE THE BIT THAT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE HAVE A THIS BILL MUCH STRONGER AND ADDRESS SOME LOCAL CONCERNS -- AT THE COUNTY LEVEL -- BUT AT THIS TIME -- I'M GONNA GIVE TIME FOR SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AND SPEAK ABOUT THIS BILL THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU SO MUCH SOME MEMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO TO KICK US OFF FIRST LAST NAME ORGANIZATION OF TWO MINUTES WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEES GOOD TO SEE SIR AMERICA. NOW WAS WITH THE FOUNDATION -- JEREMY FOR HER WORK ON STROKES. CALIFORNIA ALABAMA SO WORKABLE AND INADEQUATE HOUSING CONDITIONS BUILT ON A FARM WORKER HOUSING SYSTEM CREATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST CENTURY. THE HISTORY OF FARM WORKER HOUSING POLICY AND OUR STATE BEGINS WITH LABOR CAMPS. LABOR CAMPS DID NOT HAVE ANY TENDENCY PROTECTIONS. LABOR CAMPS DID NOT HAVE TITLE TWENTY FOUR REGULATIONS. THEY DO NOT HAVE RENTS STABILITY. LABOR CAMPS WERE COLD DAMP. AND IN DECENT PLACES TO LIVE. AND THEY WERE CONTROLLED BY EMPLOYERS [inaudible] TODAY. FARMWORKERS ARE LIVING IN GARAGES. IN BARRACKS STYLE HOUSING IN TRAILERS WITH NO AIR CONDITIONING THAT MAKE. SUMMER LIVING BRUTAL. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS IS FARMER HOUSING ACT PROPOSES TO SIMPLE THINGS. ONE IS TO EMPOWER GOOD ACTORS TO BUILD FARM WORKER HOUSING AND DO SO QUICKLY [inaudible] WHILE ALSO. PREVENTING STATE MONEY FROM ADVANCING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES. INCLUDING A PROGRAM. THAT HINDERS A FARMWORKERS FREEDOM TO LIVE FREE FROM CONTROL OF ANOTHER. IT'S WORTH RESTATING THAT THIS BILL IS VOLUNTARY. AND OPTIONAL. IF. YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ANY OF THE CRITERIA SET FORTH IN THIS BILL -- AS IT IS WRITTEN YOU CAN CONTINUE EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW UNDER EXISTING LAW. IT'S ALSO WORTH RESTATING THAT THE H. TWO A. VISA PROGRAM REQUIRES THE EMPLOYER TO PROVIDE HOUSING. AS A CONDITION OF BRINGING WORKERS HERE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY. THAT'S WHAT IT THAT'S WHAT EMPLOYERS AGREE. TO AS PART OF THE VISA PROGRAM TODAY. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW. AS A RESULT STATE MONEY IS NOT NEEDED [inaudible] BECAUSE H. TO A GUEST WORKERS ARE ALREADY PROVIDED HOUSING. SO WE THANK YOU AND WE ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. YOUR TESTIMONY ACOSTA FORCE OR SIR THANK YOU BRIAN AGAINST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL. LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION ON BEHALF OF OUR LOW INCOME -- CLIENTS INCLUDING FARMWORKERS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES WIENER HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WE'VE HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS NEED FOR FARMWORKERS HOUSING. IN THE STATE. THE VOTERS RECENTLY HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS IN ADVANCING THE PRODUCTION OF QUALITY. FAMILY HOUSING FOR FARMWORKERS BOTH THROUGH THE RECENTLY APPROVED BOND AND DID THROUGH SB TWOS INVESTMENT OF OF ANNUAL RESOURCES BUT WE NEED TO GO THE NEXT STEP AND REDUCE IMPEDIMENTS SIR. PRODUCTION OF HOUSING AND THIS BILL HELPS US TO DO THAT TO REMOVE SOME OF THE LOCAL BARRIERS HELPS CREATE. AS PRESCRIBED INVOLUNTARY PARTNERSHIPS WITH LANDOWNERS TO USE AG LAND TO HELP -- PRODUCE THAT HOUSING -- WE THINK IT'LL BE AN IMPORTANT A TOOL FOR ADVANCING THE PRODUCTION OF GOOD QUALITY LONG TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS. OF FARMWORKERS INTO. AND IMPROVE THE LIVING CONDITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED WE'RE ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE TENER PRODUCTIONS AT THE BILL PROVIDES FOR WORKERS WHO WERE LIVING. IN FORMER HOUSING FOR THOSE REASONS -- WE ARE CHEN ABOUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TEST MEANS FOR WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE SUPPORT PERSON LAST SAME ORGANIZATION SEVENS THANKS AGAIN FOR HANGING WITH US ALL DAY THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AARON EVANS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA DMV IN SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU -- INJURED BECAUSE IT -- WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WELL WE DIDN'T GET OUR TOP LETTER IN IN TIME -- FOR IF YOU FOLKS IN THE ANALYSIS WE JUST WANT TO SAY WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHARGING HEARST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. HI MARILYN HELL ON BEHALF OF BAY AREA HOUSING ADVOCATES SKILLED COLLISION OFTEN SUPPORT THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RECEIVED AS ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OR ANYONE WHO MAY BE SQUISHY. YEAH ALL RIGHT JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC -- ONE SAY WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL WE APPRECIATE EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF. WITH COMMITTEE STAFF THEY'VE BEEN VERY PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WE SHARE THE AUTHORS CONCERNED WITH TRYING TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE HOUSING STOCK FOR AGRICULTURE EMPLOYEES -- WE WERE LOOKING TO PRESERVE OUR ABILITY TO ENSURE THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THESE RESIDENTS WOULD BE PROTECTED OVER THE LONG TERM WE THINK THESE AMENDMENTS TO DO THAT -- SO WE APPRECIATE AGAIN EFFORTS TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU AND LOOK FOR TO REASSESS AND OUR POSITION AS THE BILL MOVES TOWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEY CAN SCAN A BUT I COULD SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT WE'RE NOT GONNA WELCOME THOSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSE FOR GONNA HAVE TO INDIVIDUALS TO BE SPEAKING. GERMAN WE'RE GONNA HAVE BUT I JUST THINK ROOM FOR OUR OPPOSITION IN WELCOME YOU BACK UP HERE IN A MOMENT. WELCOME. WHO LIKE A VERY KICK US OFF? HI WELL I RIDE THE WORKING COMMITTEE OF TWO MINUTES FIRST LASSEN ORGANIZATION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TAYLOR RUSSIAN WITH A CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU ALONG WITH. SEVERAL OF OUR COUNTY FROM YOURS WE ARE OPPOSED -- TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE OUR EMPLOYEES OUR FAMILY AND WE SHARE AN INTEREST JUST AS YOU ALL DO ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE SAFE AFFORDABLE -- AND HEALTHY HOUSING AND WHAT WE APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION ON THE BILL WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT THIS BILL MOVES THE NEEDLE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- AND WE BELIEVE IT'LL ACTUALLY HAVE THE ANTITHETICAL EFFECT OF LIMITING WHAT SHOULD BE VERY -- NECESSARY HOUSING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. FIRSTLY WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT PROHIBITING THE USE OF STATE FUNDING SPECIFICALLY -- FOR THOSE PROVIDED IN SB TWO FOUR HOUSING OF H. TWO EMPLOYEES WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF OUR FORTY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND 40% ARE EXPERIENCING LABOR SHORTAGES RIGHT NOW. WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE HAVE TO UTILIZE THE H. WAY PROGRAM IT'S A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT -- AND UNFORTUNATELY. ALL OF OUR DATA SHOWS THAT AGE WE POPULATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO RESTRICTING FUNDING TO BUILD NEW HOUSING DOESN'T TO TURN ROMAN IN THE PROGRAM. BUT IT DOES TIGHTEN THE AVAILABILITY OF THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK IN CALIFORNIA. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY JUST SPELL SOME MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE AGE TO A PROGRAM THE FIRST IS THAT IT'S A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION POLICY. THE TRICK PROGRAM'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR ALMOST THIRTY FIVE YEARS WE KNOW IT'S NOT THE BEST AND WE ADVOCATE ON A FEDERAL LEVEL FOR CHANGES FOR THAT PROGRAM. AT THE SECOND IS THAT. THE TREE PROGRAMS UTILIZED ONLY BY LARGE SCALE FARMS THAT'S NOT CORRECT TO FORM OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES PRODUCTION STYLES AND REGION'S UTILIZE EMPLOYEES FROM THE H. TO A PROGRAM -- AND SO IF THE PERSPECTIVE IS TO WITHHOLD FUNDS IN THIS BILL FROM THOSE WHO HAVE A READILY AVAILABLE ABILITY TO PAY. THAT'S NOT THE CASE -- AND THEN FINALLY IT'S NOT AS THOUGH -- ALL FORMS EITHER UTILIZED COLLEGE TO EMPLOYEES OR NO AGE TO EMPLOYEES WE HAVE A LOT OF FARMS THAT UTILIZE A MIX OF AGE TO WEIGH IN ON EACH -- TO EIGHT SO UNDER THIS BILL IF I HAD A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND ONE HAPPENED TO BE IN AGE TO EMPLOYEE I WOULD BE PRECLUDED FROM USING ANY STATE FUNDING TO BUILD FOR THE REMAINING. NINETY NINE WE DON'T THINK THAT A SERVICE THE BROADER PURPOSE -- RESTRICTING FUNDING FROM ONE GROUP ACTUALLY RESTRICTS FUNDING FROM ALL AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHOULD BE A ZERO SUM GAME. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INCENTIVE OFFERED IN THE BILL THE WE CAN APPRECIATE IT IS A TOOL THAT THE AUTHOR IS OFFERING JUST ONE OF MANY -- IT'S REALLY AND ACCESSIBLE. A FORMER BE RESPONSIBLE UNDER THIS BILL FOR FUNDING AND CONSTRUCTING A HOUSING UNIT AND THEN SEATING ALL OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT OF IT TO A THIRD PARTY. WELL THE RETAIN ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT IS TOO MUCH OF A RISK FOR OUR PARTIES TO TAKE -- YOU HAVE TO BE A RISK TAKER TO BE A FARMER YOU'RE AT THE MERCY OF NATURE AND THE MARKET -- BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT EMPLOYEES HOUSING SHOULD BE SOMETHING YOU GAMBLE ON ONCE AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION OF THE PROBLEM BUT THE BUILDING OF THE CARE THAT WE JUST CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WE BELIEVE PERHAPS MOST ACUTELY ARE FROM COMMUNITIES HAVE SERIES HOUSING PROBLEMS AND WE NEED SERIOUS. SOLUTIONS THE DEPLORABLE STANDARDS THAT -- THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR DESCRIBED IS IN THE ABSENCE OF EMPLOYER PROVIDED HOUSING WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED TO ADVOCATE FOR IN THIS BILL -- UNFORTUNATELY WITH THESE FUNDING RESTRICTIONS AND THE INCENTIVE AS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. OF GOVERNMENT IN AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR HEARING -- MICHAEL BILL OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION WINE GRAPE GROWERS -- WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AND THAT TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IN ANY KAMALA THE PROCESS BECAUSE WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR WHOLE HEARTEDLY THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT. BUT THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION. IN ACTUALITY BECAUSE LOOK AT A COMMON SPEND FARM BUREAU. WE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE COMMENTS WE ACTUALLY THINK THIS BILL ACTUALLY GOES OUT TO DIRECTOR OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM. WE WERE HOPEFUL THAT ALONG THE WAY BECAUSE THE COMMANDER THE AUTHOR WHICH WE TOTALLY RESPECT APPRECIATE THE MEMBERS COULD B WORKED OUT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS. THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED SO REGRETFULLY WE ARE HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. FUNDAMENTALLY THE BILL IS A WORKABLE IT'S JUST AN UNWORKABLE APPROACH OF DOES WORK FOR THREE REASONS ONE IT ACTUALLY REDUCES FUNDING FOR HOUSING AT A TIME WHEN FUNDING IS CRITICALLY NEEDED. FOR TO US THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE -- TO UNDER THIS BILL LANDOWNERS WILL BE EXPOSED TO ADDITIONAL LIABILITY BECAUSE OF THIRD PARTY MANAGEMENT REQUIRED UNDER THE BILL. WHICH IS AS POINTED OUT MAKES IT A WORKABLE THREE THE BILL CREATES A STREAMLINED PROCESS. THAT JUST DOES NOT WORK. AND WHILE IT IS REFERRED TO AS ADOPTED IN. IF IT HAS A 0% CHANCE OF SUCCESS NO ONE'S GOING TO OPT IN THERE'S NOTHING TO OPT INTO. IT REALLY IS DOWN UP DOWN. BECAUSE OF THE REDUCE WORKFORCE MORE MORE GROWERS ARE HIRING AGE TO A WORKERS. IT AS IF IT'S A FACT OF THE INDUSTRY AND SITUATION WE HAVE TODAY -- I'VE TOUR IS TO A HOUSING I'VE DESERVE THE HOUSING AND HAVE TO PUT A GET TOGETHER TOWARDS FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE THAT HOUSING IS NOT SUB STANDARD IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER. IT IS. FINE HOUSING -- IT IS OF REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW IT IS EXPECTED ELLIE BY THE STATE IS APPROVED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR -- AND TO GO OUT THAT HOUSING I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE REASON IS ESPECIALLY SINCE THAT HOUSING IS ALSO USED TO HOUSE OTHER WORKERS -- WE AGREE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE STREAMLINED PROCESS BUT THE PROCESS HAS TO WORK A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH THIS PROCESS IS A NO LENDER IS GOING TO LEND MONEY FOR THIS KIND OF HOUSING. IF YOU'RE A LENDER AND GROW COMES USES A HEY I WANT TO TAKE VENGEANCE STREAMLINED PROCESS I NEED A LOAN THE LENDER IS GOING TO SAY. HOW MUCH OF A GOOD FOR CLOSE ON THE PROPERTY WHEN THIS CAN BE A FIFTY FIVE YEAR CONDITION ON THAT PROPERTY WITH A THIRD PARTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY? ON TOP OF THAT WELL THE SPONSORS CLAIM THAT THEY WANNA SEPARATION TO THE LANDLORD OF THE EMPLOYER THIS BILL DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO THAT. BECAUSE THE EMPLOYER STILL ON THE HOOK FOR EVERYTHING SO WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS IF THERE'S A MANAGEMENT COMPANY DOING IT THEY SHOULD ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY ALL LIABILITY SB TRANSPARENCY. THERE'S GOT TO BE A PROCESS WHERE YOU CAN NEGOTIATE BASED ON ON THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AND A CAP IS SOMETHING WHERE SUDDENLY. THE THIRD PARTY COMES IN AND TAKES OVER THE OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROPERTY WHILE THE ROVER IS STILL ON THE HOOK FOR EVERYTHING ELSE THE DOESN'T ACCOMPLISH THE INTENDED -- STATED INTENT OF THE BILL THIRTY SECONDS THANK YOU SO AS I STATED WE SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THE BILL WE FULLY AGREE THERE IS A PROBLEM. BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE A REAL SOLUTION AND ABSENT A REAL SOLUTION. THIS BILL GOES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THANKS FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH SIMILAR WE'D LIKE TO GET A WELCOME ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION FIRST CLASS ORGANIZATION GOOD AFTERNOON YES GOOD AFTERNOON -- MATTER ALONG WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL.

FIFTEEN THIRTY BOILS IN BEHALF AMERICANS DASHER GROWERS IN CALIFORNIA SHRUBBERY COMMISSION OPPOSITION THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE LIKE TO GO TO DO A LAST CALL ON ANYONE WHO IS OPPOSED TO THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADVANCE IN THIS TIME. HEARING SEEN. NINE WE'RE GONNA ASK -- IF WE CAN HAVE THE SERGEANTS -- BRING A COUPLE MORE CHAIRS UP AND WE WELCOME THOSE TWO NO IT'S OKAY THE THE FOLKS WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION TO STAY.

THIS BRING IT INTO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR CONVERSATIONS WE'RE GONNA START WITH THE VICE CHAIR MISTER MORLOCK. MISTER CHAIR IN THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS AND THANKS FOR MEETING WITH ME I REALLY APPRECIATED -- BROUGHT BACK OKAY TO MEMORIES MY MY MOTHER GREW UP ON A FARM. SHE HAD FIVE BROTHERS THEY ALL WHEN IT AGRICULTURE THREE OF THEM IN AND HAVE THEIR OWN FARMS. ONE WITH INTO DAIRY BUSINESS WHERE I LIVE FOR AWHILE AND ANOTHER ONE THAT WAS IN A INDUSTRY -- I BUT I'VE EVER IS YOU'RE SHARING WITH THEM I I AS A CHILD I DIDN'T. RECALL ANY FRICTION BETWEEN. THE HELP AND MY UNCLES THEY ALL. WORK TOGETHER REALLY WELL THEY WERE JUST CRITICAL ASSETS ADD TO THE TO THE OPERATION SO I'M. ARE STILL HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH WITH THE BILL BUT I WAS JUST CURIOUS ON IDEAS -- INSIDE THIS IS SORT OF HIT ME A AND I'M JUST WANTING MISTER FERNANDES -- DOES DOES THE UFW INVEST IN HOUSING AS A AN OPPORTUNITY AND AND PROVIDE THAT AT ALL AS AN INVESTMENT EITHER ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET OR MAYBE IN YOUR PENSION PLAN. A TO MY NO. WE'RE JUST OR EVEN LIKE GETTING INVESTORS TOGETHER TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING WOULD HELP. HELP THE UFW AND AND AND YOU'RE MEMBERS IT WAS JUST. JUST AGAIN JUST TRYING TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX SO OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT'S THAT'S ALL I HAD. THE SWITCH WAS VICE CHAIR TO HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS WE ALSO WELCOME MOTION FOR IN TURN OVER CENTER ABOUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL -- NO SURPRISE. THE BILL -- HELPS WITH -- PROVIDING. OF FARM WORKER HOUSING -- IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. PROPOSITION ONE WAS SO SUCCESSFUL IN THE LAST OF YEARS BALLOT WHEN WE PUT THE JOE CERN A HOUSING -- FUN IN THE PROPOSITION -- IT -- PULLED WIDELY SUCCESSFUL AND IT WAS SHOWN TO BE IS ONE OF THE MAJOR DRIVERS IN SUPPORT FOR PROPOSITION -- ONE AND I WAS QUITE PLEASED TO DO THE JOE SERRANO BECAUSE I KNEW JOE SERRANO. AND I KNOW OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW PHIL -- WHO IS -- STRONG SUPPORTER AS WELL SO I THINK -- MR REEVE ASSEMBLYMAN RIVAS IS NOT A GOOD JOB -- WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ON OUR WAY -- TO FINDING MORE HOUSING THIS IS NOT. THE ONLY SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR HOUSING WE'RE ON OUR WAY -- TO OF COMPLETELY REVAMPED OF OUR FARM WORKER HOUSING PROGRAM WE'RE TAKING STEPS WE DID LAST YEAR WE DID PROP ONE THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. WE WORK HARD TO GET IN A LOT OF PEOPLE SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS SHOULD BE JUST THE GENERAL CATEGORIES A NO NO. WE GOT HAVE FORWARD HOUSING UNIT UNDERSTAND I WAS A FARM WORKER FOR TEN YEARS I WORKED IN THE FIELDS. HOEING VEGETABLES FOR TEN YEARS PAYING MY WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE I KNOW WHAT I KNOW WHAT I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE -- LIVING IN A TENT ALONG THE RIVER IN THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER SO I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. SO I WAS NOT DONE AS TOLERATE. THAT KIND OF SQUALID CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA WE SAY THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE WE GOT A GOOD CLEAN SAFE FARM WORKER HOUSING. NOT ONLY IT NOT ONLY AND AND AND WE WANT IT FOR EVERY EVERY OF THE STATE SO THIS IS JUST A FIRST DOWN PAYMENT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. FOR FARMWORKERS HOUSING WE OUGHT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE FARM GIRL. THE U. S. W. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPPORT. GOOD CLEAN HOUSING. FOR FARMWORKERS AND JUST SAY THAT WE JUST DON'T TOLERATE -- PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA LIVING IN HOUSING THAT'S NOT. NOT NOT OF GOOD QUALITY AND I THINK ROBERT RIVAS -- FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL AND BE HAPPY PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR FEES ACCEPTING THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH DRIVING TO SHOW QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR THE PLEASE [inaudible] BETTER CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS JUST TO SEE KIND OF IF ANYBODY. HAS THE ANSWER -- PLEASE FEEL FREE -- TO ANSWER. OP IN READING THE ANALYSIS -- I NOTICED THAT THE THE NUMBER OF JOBS CERTIFIED -- ROSE FROM WONDERING IF THAT THOSE ARE THE SAME NUMBERS THAT YOU ALL HAVE IN TERMS OF AGE TO AV SAYS AND CALIFORNIA. IS IS THAT A PRETTY ACCURATE NUMBER TO YOU ALL. PLEASE TAYLOR OCEAN BUT THE DEPARTMENT WHERE I'M SORRY TAYLOR RUSSIAN TO CALIFORNIA. WE DO I BELIEVE THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE ACCURATE BUT AS I HAD MENTIONED WE DID A FARM BUREAU -- SURVEY OF OUR FORTY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND THEY HAVE NOTED INCREASES AND CONTINUAL INCREASES IN THEIR LABOR SHORTAGES WHICH WILL IN. RESULT IN INCREASES IN EACH TO EMPLOYEES HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE EXPECT THAT NUMBER TO RISE. AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OF THE TOTAL EMPLOYEES MAKE IT DOESN'T TO BE -- EACH TO A WORKERS MAKE UP IN TERMS OF FARMWORKERS. WITHIN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] YEAH. PLEASE MISTER MILLER IN IF YOU KNOW ME AND MY NAY RETURNS YOURSELF I WAS A LESS THAN 10% SO. OKAY LESS THAN 10% OKAY AND THE DO IT DO YOU ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY SHORTAGE -- AND IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW ZINE FOR EXISTING WORKERS RIGHT NOW I MEAN ARE YOU HAVING IT CHALLENGING TO BUILD MORE WHAT. I MEAN WHAT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHEN YOU'RE MEMBERS ALSO FOR GROWERS IF YOU'RE A GROWER AND CINEMA FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE AGE TO A HOUSING IF YOU. IF YOU HAVE A STREET WORKERS YOU HAVE HOUSING AS TYPICALLY ON PREMISES RIGHT BY -- IF YOU HAVE OTHER FARMWORKERS MANY THEM COMMUTE FROM THE LATER THE COMMITTED LARGE DISTANCES SO PART OF THE PROBLEM IS TO FIND LOCALIZED HOUSING TO MAKE TO REDUCE THAT COMMUTE. TO DO SAID -- IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT EVERYTHING ELSE. AND SEVERAL OF OUR FARM EMPLOYERS PROVIDE HOUSING AS A CONDITION AS AN INCENTIVE SO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE AN OBLIGATION FOR AN ABILITY TO PAY BY THE EMPLOYER IT'S OFFERED AS AN INCENTIVE AND NOT SO PART OF THE APPROACH TRAINING COURAGE PEOPLE TO LIVE. CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORK JUST AS WE ALL WOULD APPRECIATE THAT AND TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS DOMESTIC LABOR FORCES INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PURSUE THE AGE TO A PROGRAM. I AM CENTER THAT IS IT THAT'S ALL I HAD ENOUGH YEAH AND YOU KNOW IF I COULD ADD SOMETHING I THINK YOU KNOW IT IT'S REALLY POINT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT. NO AGE TO A IS IS FROM THE HIGHLY REGULATED YOU KNOW OF A FEDERAL PROGRAM AND PART OF THE YOU KNOW THOSE REGULAIONS IS A HIGH STANDARD OF OF OF HOUSING YOU KNOW THE THE GROWER THE FARM OPERATION. HAS TO PROVIDE THE HOUSING YOU KNOW THERE'S A HIGH STANDARD ABOUT THAT QUALITY. AND SO.
