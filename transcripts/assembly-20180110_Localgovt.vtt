PRESENT THIS BILL BUT.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.277 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE I HAVE IS THAT

00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:13.412 region:rollup2
FROM UP FROM A POLICY

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:15.381 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE THE STATE OF

00:25:13.412 --> 00:25:16.181 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS SAID WE SHOULD BE

00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:17.783 region:rollup2
DOING OUR TRANSPORTATION.

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:20.386 region:rollup2
.

00:25:17.783 --> 00:25:21.587 region:rollup2
PLANNING ON A REGIONAL BASIS AND

00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:23.188 region:rollup2
WE'VE SET UP A WHOLE

00:25:21.587 --> 00:25:24.857 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER FOR THAT

00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:26.592 region:rollup2
TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE ONE IS

00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:27.960 region:rollup2
THERE TO BE FREE FLOW. OF OF

00:25:26.592 --> 00:25:30.229 region:rollup2
TRAFFIC FROM ONE COUNTY TO THE

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.663 region:rollup2
OTHER END ON IT IT IS AN EASY

00:25:30.229 --> 00:25:33.265 region:rollup2
HAVING.

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:34.266 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:35.367 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WHO HAVE MAY HAVE A

00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:36.435 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE VIEW OF

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:39.204 region:rollup2
THE WORLD BUT THE IDEA IS

00:25:36.435 --> 00:25:40.773 region:rollup2
REGIONAL PLANNING I'M I'M. I M..

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:42.241 region:rollup2
.

00:25:40.773 --> 00:25:43.675 region:rollup2
I THINK I REALLY THINK THANK THE

00:25:42.241 --> 00:25:44.209 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY FROM CLASSIC COUNTY

00:25:43.675 --> 00:25:46.378 region:rollup2
AND ALSO.

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:48.247 region:rollup2
FROM ENCINITAS BECAUSE THOSE

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:50.716 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS AN ARTICULATION

00:25:48.247 --> 00:25:53.185 region:rollup2
OF A SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT'S LOCAL

00:25:50.716 --> 00:25:55.187 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I TOLD MR GLORIA IS ON

00:25:53.185 --> 00:25:57.823 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. IS.

00:25:55.187 --> 00:26:00.726 region:rollup2
IT THERE'S ALWAYS FRICTION

00:25:57.823 --> 00:26:02.728 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE URBAN. AYE CENTERS

00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:04.196 region:rollup2
AND THE MORE RURAL CENTERS AND

00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:06.432 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO FRICTION BETWEEN

00:26:04.196 --> 00:26:08.867 region:rollup2
POOR COMMUNITIES WHO RELY VERY

00:26:06.432 --> 00:26:10.235 region:rollup2
HEAVILY MAYBE ON ONE FORM OF

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:11.470 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION AND THE WEALTHIER

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:13.705 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IT MAY NOT.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:15.674 region:rollup2
AND I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

00:26:13.705 --> 00:26:17.209 region:rollup2
SETTING UP A THE POSSIBILITY OF

00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:19.845 region:rollup2
CHERRY PICKING WHERE YOU WANT TO

00:26:17.209 --> 00:26:20.345 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO TO. TO TO WIN A

00:26:19.845 --> 00:26:21.947 region:rollup2
BALLOT MEASURE AND IT IT

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:23.549 region:rollup2
DOESN'T.

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:24.950 region:rollup2
IT.

00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:26.585 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF SAYING WE WANT TO

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.320 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE U. FIGURING OUT THE

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:30.089 region:rollup2
BIG PICTURE AND MEETING

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.924 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S NEEDS IT IT ALLOWS

00:26:30.089 --> 00:26:33.826 region:rollup2
YOU TO DO AND JUST GET MORE PRO

00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:35.661 region:rollup2
CABLE AND FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF

00:26:33.826 --> 00:26:36.595 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE AND I'M

00:26:35.661 --> 00:26:38.664 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT IT LEAVES OUT AS

00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:39.631 region:rollup2
A. AS A TRANSPORTATION PLANNER

00:26:38.664 --> 00:26:42.701 region:rollup2
IT LEAVES OUT THE BIG PICTURE

00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:44.670 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WHAT I TOLD HIM I'M

00:26:42.701 --> 00:26:46.205 region:rollup2
A NO VOTE TODAY WHEN I TOLD HIM

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.973 region:rollup2
IS I'M WILLING TO CONSIDER A

00:26:46.205 --> 00:26:49.141 region:rollup2
REGIONAL APPROACH TO IT WHERE

00:26:47.973 --> 00:26:50.709 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM

00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:53.078 region:rollup2
THAT'S. CREATED REGIONALLY I'M

00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:54.213 region:rollup2
NOT SURE I'M READY TO MOVE.

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:55.948 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE HAVING A POLICY

00:26:54.213 --> 00:26:58.183 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

00:26:55.948 --> 00:26:59.118 region:rollup2
REALLY IN CONTRAVENTION OF WHAT

00:26:58.183 --> 00:27:00.285 region:rollup2
WE'VE SET UP IN TERMS OF

00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:02.354 region:rollup2
REGIONAL PLANNING SO.

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:03.622 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT THE BILL HERE

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:04.556 region:rollup2
TODAY IF THERE'S AN INTEREST IF

00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:06.191 region:rollup2
YOU HAS AN INTEREST IN DOING

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:07.860 region:rollup2
THAT DOWN THE ROAD I'M MORE THAN

00:27:06.191 --> 00:27:09.728 region:rollup2
MONEY TO TO LOOK AT THAT BUT.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.296 region:rollup2
I'M JUST CONCERNED BECAUSE.

00:27:09.728 --> 00:27:13.699 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

00:27:11.296 --> 00:27:15.834 region:rollup2
WHEN I LOOK AT MY REGION.

00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:18.403 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE TRANSPORTATION

00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:19.872 region:rollup2
NETWORK.

00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:22.274 region:rollup2
THAT IS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS

00:27:19.872 --> 00:27:24.042 region:rollup2
FROM SAN JOSE NORTH.

00:27:22.274 --> 00:27:26.245 region:rollup2
AND AND IN AN INCLUDES A TRAIN

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:28.680 region:rollup2
SERVICE AND THEN TO THE SOUTH

00:27:26.245 --> 00:27:29.948 region:rollup2
IT'S SAN LUIS OBISPO SOUTH.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.316 region:rollup2
AND SO GUESS WHO'S RIGHT IN THE

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:33.252 region:rollup2
MIDDLE WITH ABSOLUTELY NO NO

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:34.353 region:rollup2
SERVICE AND BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:27:33.252 --> 00:27:36.155 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY JUICE IN THOSE

00:27:34.353 --> 00:27:37.489 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES WORK

00:27:36.155 --> 00:27:39.258 region:rollup2
WERE LEFT OUT AND SO THE

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:40.359 region:rollup2
REGIONAL APPROACH. IS THE ONLY

00:27:39.258 --> 00:27:42.227 region:rollup2
WAY WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET

00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:43.762 region:rollup2

ISSUES WITH THE.

00:28:18.964 --> 00:28:22.200 region:rollup2
ENCINITAS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP

IN THE DOUBLE TRACKING AND ALL

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.571 region:rollup2

THOSE THINGS DONE. I DON'T SEE

00:28:33.078 --> 00:28:38.617 region:rollup2
HOW A REGIONAL TAXING APPROACH

00:28:36.415 --> 00:28:39.551 region:rollup2
COULD EVEN. BEGIN THE GENERATE

00:28:38.617 --> 00:28:40.986 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD

00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:42.788 region:rollup2
BE NEEDED TO DO A GRADE

00:28:40.986 --> 00:28:45.490 region:rollup2
SEPARATION OR SOMETHING. LIKE

00:28:42.788 --> 00:28:47.526 region:rollup2
THAT SO I MEAN I AGREE. THE

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:48.961 region:rollup2
REGIONAL APPROACH WHEN YOU LOOK

00:28:47.526 --> 00:28:50.329 region:rollup2
AT ALL THE CONNECTIONS YOU NEED

00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:52.064 region:rollup2
BUS CONNECTIONS YOU NEED ALL

00:28:50.329 --> 00:28:54.766 region:rollup2
KINDS OF OTHER CONNECTIONS MULTI

MODAL IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO.

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:58.203 region:rollup2
.

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:59.538 region:rollup2
AND MAKE IT WORK I DON'T SEE HOW

00:28:58.203 --> 00:29:01.673 region:rollup2
JUST DOING YOU KNOW WANTED TO

00:28:59.538 --> 00:29:04.109 region:rollup2
CITIES OR EVEN JUST THE COLESLAW

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:05.711 region:rollup2
KARA WOULD BE ENOUGH TO GENERATE

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:06.845 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED

00:29:05.711 --> 00:29:07.412 region:rollup2
TO DO.

00:29:06.845 --> 00:29:09.581 region:rollup2
A FUNDING MECHANISM AND YOU

00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:11.783 region:rollup2

TOGETHER AS ONE TO DO REGIONAL

00:29:17.356 --> 00:29:19.891 region:rollup2

DO WE WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE EVEN

00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:26.698 region:rollup2
AT THIS HEARING I HAVE ASKED THE

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.766 region:rollup2
QUESTION WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HAVE

A TAX.

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:32.004 region:rollup2
ON THE ON THE BALLOT AND ONLY

00:29:30.002 --> 00:29:32.971 region:rollup2
ONE PART OF THE AREA DECIDES TO

00:29:32.004 --> 00:29:35.140 region:rollup2
DO AND WE'RE GOING TO BUILD HALF

00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:36.008 region:rollup2
A PLAN. AND THEY WERE LIKE WE

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.676 region:rollup2

THAT BUT I STILL DON'T SEE HOW

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.484 region:rollup2
IT WOULD WORK ON A REGIONAL

00:29:43.282 --> 00:29:49.221 region:rollup2

OTHER MEAN TO GET TECHNICAL BUT

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:18.856 region:rollup2
HAVING WORKED IN THE

LAW AND.

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:26.998 region:rollup2

REVIEWED IN AND.

00:39:26.998 --> 00:39:30.034 region:rollup2

ANTICIPATES IN SENATOR

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:33.738 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND THAT'S

00:39:32.237 --> 00:39:34.973 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN JUST HAVING

00:39:33.738 --> 00:39:36.641 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ECONOMIST FOR EXAMPLE

00:39:34.973 --> 00:39:39.077 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT.

00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:40.645 region:rollup2
AT AT THE REPORT IN ANALYZING IT

00:39:39.077 --> 00:39:42.547 region:rollup2
AND AND GIVING THEIR OWN

00:39:40.645 --> 00:39:43.881 region:rollup2
OPINIONS SO I'M I'M A LITTLE BIT

00:39:42.547 --> 00:39:45.216 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THE OTHER

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:45.783 region:rollup2
QUESTION I HAD. SO I WAS

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:47.185 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST OF

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.385 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:39:47.185 --> 00:39:49.153 region:rollup2
THE.

00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:52.023 region:rollup2
.

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:54.359 region:rollup2
THE BILL SAYS THAT THE HARBOR

00:39:52.023 --> 00:39:57.328 region:rollup2
AGENCY WILL. ON.

00:39:54.359 --> 00:39:58.663 region:rollup2
AB REIMBURSE THE AYE BANK FOR.

00:39:57.328 --> 00:40:00.932 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN ADMINISTRATIVE

00:39:58.663 --> 00:40:03.468 region:rollup2
EXPENSES AND USUALLY ONE HAVE A

00:40:00.932 --> 00:40:05.803 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM SO THAT. THE IBM CAN SEE

00:40:03.468 --> 00:40:06.371 region:rollup2
BY THE WAY THIRTY PERCENT OR YOU

00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:07.472 region:rollup2
KNOW A NUMBER THAT'S REALLY

00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:09.040 region:rollup2
HIGH.

00:40:07.472 --> 00:40:10.842 region:rollup2
I WOULD RECOMMEND SOME NUMBER

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.678 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE NUMBER

00:40:10.842 --> 00:40:15.079 region:rollup2
THAT MAKE SENSE BY A AYE AYE M..

00:40:13.678 --> 00:40:16.714 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE AYE BANK

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:17.682 region:rollup2
USES AS THE RULE OF THUMB BUT IT

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:19.484 region:rollup2
WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW THAT AND

00:40:17.682 --> 00:40:21.486 region:rollup2
THEN THE OTHER ISSUE I HAD ON.

00:40:19.484 --> 00:40:22.854 region:rollup2
WHICH.

00:40:21.486 --> 00:40:25.056 region:rollup2
UP YOU KNOW KIND OF THE DEVIL'S

00:40:22.854 --> 00:40:28.159 region:rollup2
IN THE DETAILS IS THE ISSUE

00:40:25.056 --> 00:40:30.662 region:rollup2
RELATED TO PURCHASING EQUIPMENT.

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:32.797 region:rollup2
FOR A PRIVATE PARTY.

00:40:30.662 --> 00:40:34.399 region:rollup2
THAT IT THEN OWNS AND OPERATES

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:36.134 region:rollup2
THAT EQUIPMENT.

00:40:34.399 --> 00:40:37.802 region:rollup2
THAT THEN BECOMES OF THE

00:40:36.134 --> 00:40:39.304 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OF THE STATE WHEN

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:41.372 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DONE WITH IT AND.

00:40:39.304 --> 00:40:42.473 region:rollup2
IT AND I GUESS THE CONCERN

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:44.008 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT IS A BIT IF IF IT'S

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:45.443 region:rollup2
PAID.

00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:46.744 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S PROPERTY THAT'S PESO

00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:48.346 region:rollup2
BUT LIKE RENTING RENTERS DON'T

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:50.348 region:rollup2
TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF THE

00:40:48.346 --> 00:40:52.850 region:rollup2
PLACES THEY RENTED A GENERAL.

00:40:50.348 --> 00:40:54.052 region:rollup2
IF THEY TAKE A LOT MORE CARE OF

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:55.853 region:rollup2
IT IF IT'S THEIR OWN IF THEY

00:40:54.052 --> 00:40:58.056 region:rollup2
PAID THEIR OWN MONEY FOR IT SO

00:40:55.853 --> 00:41:01.326 region:rollup2
I'M CONCERNED WITH WITH USING

00:40:58.056 --> 00:41:02.126 region:rollup2
THAT PUBLIC RESOURCES TO THEN.

00:41:01.326 --> 00:41:03.795 region:rollup2
GET EQUIPMENT.

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:05.830 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:07.231 region:rollup2
THE WET WITH OUT THERE BEING A

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.566 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THAT THEY MAINTAIN

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:10.034 region:rollup2
IT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL SO THAT

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:11.970 region:rollup2
IT REALLY HAS MAINTAINED ITS

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:14.405 region:rollup2
VALUE AND IT'S GOT SOME.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:16.074 region:rollup2
.

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:16.607 region:rollup2
SO IT'S SO THAT IS PROTECTED

00:41:16.074 --> 00:41:17.308 region:rollup2
AGAINST IT SO THE ACID IS

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:17.475 region:rollup2
PROTECTED

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:20.311 region:rollup2
AND.

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:21.979 region:rollup2
.

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:23.314 region:rollup2
SO I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AS

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:24.949 region:rollup2
WELL AND THAT'S OBVIOUS

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:25.550 region:rollup2
SOMETHING YOU PUT IN A CONTRACT

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:26.617 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:30.321 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S.

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:31.656 region:rollup2
THAT THE INVESTMENT IN STATE.

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.223 region:rollup2
WHEN IF YOU'RE USING STATE FUNDS

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:33.224 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE PROTECTING THAT

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:37.662 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:38.997 region:rollup2
SO CHAIR.

THANK YOU SO IN EVERY QUESTIONS

00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:42.633 region:rollup2
ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:43.368 region:rollup2
COST YOU KNOW THERE'S A TENSION.

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:45.203 region:rollup2
IN THE DESIGN OF THE BILL

00:41:43.368 --> 00:41:46.971 region:rollup2
BETWEEN HAVING INFRASTRUCTURE

00:41:45.203 --> 00:41:49.273 region:rollup2
BANKS COME COSTS BE REIMBURSED

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:50.174 region:rollup2
BY THE PORCH BUT THEN WITH WITH

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:52.643 region:rollup2
A CAP ON THAT THEN THE

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:53.845 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE BANK HAS COSTS

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:55.680 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID FOR.

00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:57.115 region:rollup2
BY THE GENERAL FUND AND SO WE

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.583 region:rollup2
DESIGNED THE BILL SO THAT THE

00:41:57.115 --> 00:41:59.684 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE BANK IN REVIEWING

00:41:58.583 --> 00:42:01.352 region:rollup2
THE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE

00:41:59.684 --> 00:42:03.021 region:rollup2
INITIATED BY THE COURTS. WOULD

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:04.155 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO THEN SUBMIT THEIR

00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:06.624 region:rollup2
COST TO THE PORCH WHO ARE

00:42:04.155 --> 00:42:07.625 region:rollup2
SEEKING APPROVAL FROM THE STATE.

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:09.193 region:rollup2
FOR THIS KIND OF THE FINANCING

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:10.461 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENT.

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:11.696 region:rollup2
BUT WE'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:12.697 region:rollup2
AND YOUR STAFF TO COME UP WITH

00:42:11.696 --> 00:42:13.931 region:rollup2
SOME BETTER RIGHT DESIGNS ON

00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:15.199 region:rollup2
THAT BUT THAT WAS KIND OF OUR

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:17.035 region:rollup2
BEST APPROACH TO. ADDRESS THE

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:19.137 region:rollup2
COST ISSUE.

00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:20.505 region:rollup2
AND THEN SECONDLY WHAT'S. SO IF

00:42:19.137 --> 00:42:21.906 region:rollup2
I COULD ON THE INVESTMENT BANK

00:42:20.505 --> 00:42:23.508 region:rollup2
UP THEY DON'T USE THEY DON'T

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:24.142 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T GET INFUSIONS OF

00:42:23.508 --> 00:42:25.810 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND HAVE IT THEY'VE

00:42:24.142 --> 00:42:28.513 region:rollup2
THERE THEY HAVE A REVOLVING

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:28.679 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT THAT THEY USE RIGHT AND

00:42:28.513 --> 00:42:31.249 region:rollup2
SO.

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:32.950 region:rollup2
WEREN'T.

00:42:31.249 --> 00:42:33.951 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT ANTICIPATE IN OTHER

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.586 region:rollup2
WORDS THE MONEY WOULD HAVE TO

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:37.455 region:rollup2
COME OUT OF THIS. GRANT BUT I

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:39.891 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO

00:42:37.455 --> 00:42:40.525 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE

00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:41.926 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU TO DO

00:42:40.525 --> 00:42:42.560 region:rollup2
IT ALONE.

00:42:41.926 --> 00:42:44.629 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:47.698 region:rollup2
EITHER DON'T GET IT BACK IN THE

00:42:44.629 --> 00:42:49.801 region:rollup2
LOAN PROCESS USUALLY AND IF THIS

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:51.169 region:rollup2
IS THE GRANT. PROGRAM THEN THEY

00:42:49.801 --> 00:42:52.970 region:rollup2
DON'T GET IT BACK IN THE LOAN

00:42:51.169 --> 00:42:54.238 region:rollup2
IT'S A GRANT AND THEN WE GOT TO

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.706 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT WITH THE

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:57.041 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COST IS. AND

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:58.776 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SPEAKING THE

00:42:57.041 --> 00:43:00.411 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS USUALLY END

00:42:58.776 --> 00:43:01.779 region:rollup2
IN BILLS ARE ANYWHERE FROM. MEET

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:04.415 region:rollup2
THEY'RE USUALLY NOT MORE THAN

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:05.950 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT SO I WOULD FEEL

00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:07.618 region:rollup2
MORE COMFORTABLE IN THIS KIND OF

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:09.387 region:rollup2
A PROCESS HAVING A NUMBER. AND

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:11.656 region:rollup2
YOU AND I WOULD ADVISE WORKING

00:43:09.387 --> 00:43:12.223 region:rollup2
WITH THE I. BANK BECAUSE THEY'LL

00:43:11.656 --> 00:43:13.124 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT NUMBER IN TERMS OF

00:43:12.223 --> 00:43:14.625 region:rollup2
HOW.

00:43:13.124 --> 00:43:16.461 region:rollup2
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE LOAN THE

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:18.362 region:rollup2
END UP?

00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:19.464 region:rollup2
EITHER HOLDING BACK OR USING AS

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:23.267 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO PAY THEMSELVES SO.

00:43:19.464 --> 00:43:24.669 region:rollup2
SO.

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:25.470 region:rollup2
TYPOGRAPHY READING AND HEARING

00:43:24.669 --> 00:43:27.038 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR.

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.773 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT GOOD POINTS ABOUT

00:43:27.038 --> 00:43:30.274 region:rollup2
HAVING SOME GUIDELINES YOU KNOW

00:43:28.773 --> 00:43:31.442 region:rollup2
FOR LIMITATIONS ON

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:32.677 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THE POINT

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:34.679 region:rollup2
OF THIS BILL AND WE DIDN'T BRING

00:43:32.677 --> 00:43:36.614 region:rollup2
IDEA FOR IT IN. TWO THOUSAND

00:43:34.679 --> 00:43:38.015 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN ARE NOW TO HAVE YOU KNOW

00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:40.218 region:rollup2
TOO MANY RESOURCES GOAL TORIES

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:42.286 region:rollup2
OVERHEAD WE WANT. THIS TO BE A

00:43:40.218 --> 00:43:43.888 region:rollup2
FINANCING PROGRAM TO GET GREENER

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:45.823 region:rollup2
CLEAR PROJECTS AT PORTSMOUTH

00:43:43.888 --> 00:43:47.558 region:rollup2
SUPPORT EQUIPMENT WHICH IS IN

00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:48.426 region:rollup2
KEEPING WITH THE STATE'S GOALS.

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:50.495 region:rollup2
IN A SUSTAINABLE AFRAID ACTION

00:43:48.426 --> 00:43:51.229 region:rollup2
PLAN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ISSUED

00:43:50.495 --> 00:43:53.464 region:rollup2
BY THE GOVERNOR.

00:43:51.229 --> 00:43:54.532 region:rollup2
SO WE WOULD VERY MUCH WORK WITH

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:56.000 region:rollup2
YOU TO TAKE YOUR ADVICE AND TRY

00:43:54.532 --> 00:43:57.435 region:rollup2
TO GET SOME FEEDBACK.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.237 region:rollup2
FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK ON

00:43:57.435 --> 00:44:00.805 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HOW THE DESIGN THAT WILL

00:43:59.237 --> 00:44:02.874 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AN ACCEPTABLE.

00:44:00.805 --> 00:44:04.809 region:rollup2
LIMITATION ON WITH RESPECT TO

00:44:02.874 --> 00:44:06.711 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ON THAT.

00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:08.279 region:rollup2
VERY HAPPY TO DO THAT THE NINETY

00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:09.480 region:rollup2
SECOND POINT ABOUT.

OVER TIME.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:16.354 region:rollup2
THE PORT SIR PUBLIC ASSETS OF

THE STATE THE PUBLIC PORTS IN A

00:44:16.354 --> 00:44:22.026 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OWN OPERATE

00:44:18.189 --> 00:44:23.094 region:rollup2
THESE. ASSETS BASICALLY ENTRUST.

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:23.995 region:rollup2
THE TIDE LINES ACT WOULD STAY

00:44:23.094 --> 00:44:26.063 region:rollup2
TO CALIFORNIA AND THEY SET

00:44:23.995 --> 00:44:28.232 region:rollup2
STANDARDS FOR. THE MEMBER

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:29.467 region:rollup2
COMPANIES OF PMSA WHO ARE THE

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:31.936 region:rollup2
ACTUAL TERMINAL OPERATORS.

00:44:29.467 --> 00:44:33.538 region:rollup2
ON MANY MANY THINGS INCLUDING.

00:44:31.936 --> 00:44:35.573 region:rollup2
GOOD WORKING ORDER OF THE

00:44:33.538 --> 00:44:37.808 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT BUT ALSO ENVIRONMENTAL

00:44:35.573 --> 00:44:39.243 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF THAT EQUIPMENT.

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:42.246 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON

00:44:39.243 --> 00:44:43.247 region:rollup2
IS TRYING TO GET THE PORCH TO

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:44.882 region:rollup2
INVEST EARLIER THAN THEY MAY

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:46.417 region:rollup2
HAVE OTHERWISE WOULD TO BUY

00:44:44.882 --> 00:44:47.752 region:rollup2
CLEANER GREENER ZERO MISSIONS

00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:49.020 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT.

00:44:47.752 --> 00:44:50.188 region:rollup2
SOONER THEN THE OTHER WOULD

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.422 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE USEFUL LIFE OF

00:44:50.188 --> 00:44:52.990 region:rollup2
WHAT'S CURRENTLY ON THE PART

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:54.992 region:rollup2
PROPERTY NOW.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:56.727 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE THE INCENTIVES OF

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:58.796 region:rollup2
WE SAT THROUGH LEGISLATION TO

00:44:56.727 --> 00:45:00.198 region:rollup2
REGULATORY GOALS AND PUBLIC

00:44:58.796 --> 00:45:01.799 region:rollup2
DOLLARS HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN

00:45:00.198 --> 00:45:01.999 region:rollup2
FORKS AND IMPORTANT WITH MEN.

THIS SOURCE THAT WE'RE

AND MANY OTHER SOURCES TO SO

00:45:11.008 --> 00:45:16.080 region:rollup2
THERE'S. A LOT OF PRECEDENT FOR

00:45:13.644 --> 00:45:17.548 region:rollup2
HAVING THE PUBLIC INCENTIVIZE

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.717 region:rollup2
AND HARDER INVESTING IN CLEANER

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:21.185 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT COURTS.

00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:22.520 region:rollup2
THREE GOOD. MEN IN THEM ONE LAST

00:45:21.185 --> 00:45:24.255 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT IN TERMS OF THE LAND

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.525 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:28.593 region:rollup2
IT THAT THEY CAN OBJECT AND

00:45:27.525 --> 00:45:29.927 region:rollup2
THAT CATCH THINKS THE WHOLE DEAL

00:45:28.593 --> 00:45:31.529 region:rollup2
AND I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S A

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:32.897 region:rollup2
WAY TO DO THAT FIRST.

00:45:31.529 --> 00:45:34.632 region:rollup2
ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THEM

00:45:32.897 --> 00:45:37.335 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE ECONOMIC.

00:45:34.632 --> 00:45:39.670 region:rollup2
BUT REPORT AS WELL OR IT JUST

00:45:37.335 --> 00:45:40.571 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT. IF YOU'RE

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.706 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A KILL

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:43.507 region:rollup2
SWITCH.

00:45:41.706 --> 00:45:45.176 region:rollup2
THE EARLIER IT IS BEFORE YOU

00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:45.810 region:rollup2
SPEND MONEY THE BETTER.

00:45:45.176 --> 00:45:47.411 region:rollup2
AND.

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:47.979 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.647 region:rollup2
THE STATE LANDS IS THE KILL

00:45:47.979 --> 00:45:50.982 region:rollup2
SWITCH.

00:45:49.647 --> 00:45:52.617 region:rollup2
THEY ARE THE KILL SWITCH IN THE

00:45:50.982 --> 00:45:53.818 region:rollup2
END OF THE PORCH BASICALLY HAVE

00:45:52.617 --> 00:45:55.953 region:rollup2
SUBORDINATE A DELEGATED

00:45:53.818 --> 00:45:57.288 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY FROM THE LAST MISSION.

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:59.490 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:45:57.288 --> 00:46:01.092 region:rollup2
WE DIDN'T FORMALLY RIGHT A ROLE

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.093 region:rollup2
ON THE FRONT END BECAUSE WE

00:46:01.092 --> 00:46:03.327 region:rollup2
THINK THE LAST COMMISSION

00:46:02.093 --> 00:46:04.962 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY THE ROLE THEY PLAY IS

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:05.863 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT.

00:46:04.962 --> 00:46:08.466 region:rollup2
IT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE OF THE

00:46:05.863 --> 00:46:10.868 region:rollup2
LAND AND FOR ANY TERMINAL OR ANY

00:46:08.466 --> 00:46:12.970 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY ON TIGHTLY AS PROPERTY.

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:14.505 region:rollup2
MAINTAINED LOCALLY THEY HAVE TO

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:16.407 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS TODAY.

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:17.274 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN BILLS IN THIS

00:46:16.407 --> 00:46:18.909 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ON THIS QUESTION

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:20.444 region:rollup2
BEFORE. AND SO.

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:22.079 region:rollup2
WE'VE EITHER THAT PROCESS WOULD

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:23.581 region:rollup2
WORK WITH IF THERE'S A FURTHER

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:24.315 region:rollup2
CONCERN WE CAN TRY AND ADDRESS

00:46:23.581 --> 00:46:26.150 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:46:24.315 --> 00:46:28.052 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE HAVE THE

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:29.887 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS DONE INITIALLY

00:46:28.052 --> 00:46:30.621 region:rollup2
BY THE PORT AS AN AGENT OF THE

00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:32.189 region:rollup2

THROUGH THE THAILAND'S ACT

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:35.059 region:rollup2
AND HAVE THEM THERE HAS TO BE

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:36.127 region:rollup2
VERIFIED BY INDEPENDENT

00:46:35.059 --> 00:46:37.862 region:rollup2
CONSULTANT THAT'S NOT ON THE

00:46:36.127 --> 00:46:39.030 region:rollup2
PAYROLL OF.

00:46:37.862 --> 00:46:41.732 region:rollup2
THE TERMINAL OPERATOR OR THE

ONES BEARING THE COST AND IT'S

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:25.770 region:rollup2
REALLY INCUMBENT UPON THEM TO

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.437 region:rollup2
MAKE THE CASE TO GET THE

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.104 region:rollup2
FACILITY THAT WHEN YOUR TIME OF

KIND OF A IN THE LAST IN THE

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.175 region:rollup2
LINE THEY DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:31.976 region:rollup2
IN THE BEGINNING WHEN IT'S NOT

00:48:31.175 --> 00:48:33.110 region:rollup2

EAST COAST. IT AND THAT REALLY

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:58.502 region:rollup2
IS THE KEY IS THAT OUR COURTS

00:48:56.767 --> 00:49:01.005 region:rollup2
ARE FALLING BEHIND IN BUSINESSES

00:48:58.502 --> 00:49:02.773 region:rollup2

TO BE ABLE TO STAY COMPETITIVE

00:49:08.179 --> 00:49:11.649 region:rollup2
ANSWER HE HAD DONE A BILL THIS

00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:13.918 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FURTHERS THAT IT

00:49:11.649 --> 00:49:15.286 region:rollup2
CREATES A NEW FACILITY. AND AND

00:49:13.918 --> 00:49:17.254 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T YOU'D MENTION A

00:49:15.286 --> 00:49:18.789 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF GREAT POINTS ABOUT YOU

00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:19.890 region:rollup2
KNOW THE COSTS INVOLVED IN HOW

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:21.659 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD BE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:23.661 region:rollup2
COST BE IT CETERA. ALL OF THESE

00:49:21.659 --> 00:49:25.563 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AGREED UPON BY THE

00:49:23.661 --> 00:49:27.865 region:rollup2
ACTUAL POOR OPERATORS AND THE

00:49:25.563 --> 00:49:29.967 region:rollup2
PORTS THEMSELVES PRIOR TO THE

00:49:27.865 --> 00:49:31.101 region:rollup2
DEALS GOING THROUGH SO I I

00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:33.370 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SHARE YOUR CONCERN OF

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:35.306 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE.

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:36.607 region:rollup2
AND COST ULTIMATELY TO THE PORTS

00:49:35.306 --> 00:49:38.142 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW THIS WOULD BE THE

00:49:36.607 --> 00:49:40.077 region:rollup2
OPENING THAT THE LANE IF YOU

00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:41.645 region:rollup2
WILL AND THEN IT WOULD BE UP TO

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:43.747 region:rollup2
THE PORCH DECIDE AND POOR

FACILITY TO GET THIS DEAL DONE

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:52.022 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY WOULD BASICALLY MAKE

00:49:51.522 --> 00:49:54.625 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE DEAL WAS

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:56.627 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABLE FOR THEM. BEFORE IT

00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:57.394 region:rollup2
AS THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT WAS

00:49:56.627 --> 00:49:59.363 region:rollup2
BROUGHT THROUGH THE STATE

00:49:57.394 --> 00:50:01.532 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AND THEN OF COURSE THE

00:49:59.363 --> 00:50:04.068 region:rollup2
STATE STILL HAS THE ABILITY WITH

00:50:01.532 --> 00:50:07.872 region:rollup2
THE STATE LANDS AND AND THE

00:50:04.068 --> 00:50:09.773 region:rollup2
OTHER IDENTITIES. TO SHUT YOU

KNOW ANY OF THESE DEALS NOW THEY

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:15.479 region:rollup2
DIDN'T LIKE THE DEALS BUT IT

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:16.914 region:rollup2
OPENS UP A LANE THAT DOESN'T

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:17.715 region:rollup2
EXIST RIGHT NOW.

00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:18.515 region:rollup2
AND WE TAKE A LOOK AT AYE SO MY

CITIES INCORPORATING OF

00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:23.220 region:rollup2
INCORPORATING ORANGE COUNTY BUT

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:24.455 region:rollup2
I ENDED THE ARM LA LINE SO I GO

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.956 region:rollup2
RIGHT UP TO THE LONG BEACH LINE.

00:50:24.455 --> 00:50:26.624 region:rollup2

LEN LONG BEACH RIGHT THERE. AND

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:29.760 region:rollup2

DISTRICT A LOT OF SUPPORT

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.528 region:rollup2
WORKERS LIVE RIGHT IN MY

AND YOU KNOW WITH THE NUMBERS WE

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:33.664 region:rollup2
STARTED WE STAYED IN THE

THROUGH OUR PORTS.

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:38.369 region:rollup2

OUR PORTS WHICH MAKES THEM MORE

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:17.334 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE AVE DOES IT TIE

00:52:14.298 --> 00:52:18.469 region:rollup2
ANYBODY'S HANDS IT JUST GIVES

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:22.006 region:rollup2

00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:22.506 region:rollup2
PRECIADO THINKS.

00:52:22.006 --> 00:52:24.775 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:25.843 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

00:52:24.775 --> 00:52:27.244 region:rollup2
YES.

00:52:25.843 --> 00:52:29.513 region:rollup2
OF SOMERVELL PELVIC.

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:32.750 region:rollup2
I SUPPORT THIS BILL.

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:35.419 region:rollup2
AND HERE'S THE REASON.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:35.953 region:rollup2
WE'VE.

00:52:35.419 --> 00:52:38.489 region:rollup2
BEN IN A RECOVERY FOR NINE

00:52:35.953 --> 00:52:40.691 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:52:38.489 --> 00:52:43.527 region:rollup2
TIMES HAVE BEEN GOOD.

00:52:40.691 --> 00:52:45.529 region:rollup2
OUR BUDGET LOOKS GOOD.

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:46.330 region:rollup2
SUPPOSEDLY.

00:52:45.529 --> 00:52:48.465 region:rollup2
THEN I DON'T USE THAT WORD

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:50.567 region:rollup2
POLITICALLY.

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:52.536 region:rollup2
SUPPOSEDLY WE OF A NINE TEAM

00:52:50.567 --> 00:52:55.105 region:rollup2
POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR

00:52:52.536 --> 00:52:56.440 region:rollup2
SURPLUS RIGHT NOW IN THE BANK.

00:52:55.105 --> 00:52:58.976 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON I USETHE WORD

00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.544 region:rollup2
SUPPOSEDLY IS NOT YOU GOTTA

00:52:58.976 --> 00:53:01.345 region:rollup2
COUNTED UP. DON'T KNOW COULD BE

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:04.314 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT OFF.

00:53:01.345 --> 00:53:07.518 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW.

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:09.019 region:rollup2
WE WILL HAVE A RECESSION.

00:53:07.518 --> 00:53:11.588 region:rollup2
NO DOUBT.

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:13.123 region:rollup2
ALWAYS COMES.

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:15.459 region:rollup2
AND THIS NEXT RECESSION MAY BE

00:53:13.123 --> 00:53:18.062 region:rollup2
VERY STRANGE.

00:53:15.459 --> 00:53:20.497 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THEIR POLITICAL

00:53:18.062 --> 00:53:23.167 region:rollup2
SITUATION OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA

00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:27.771 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW.

00:53:23.167 --> 00:53:29.740 region:rollup2
SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE.

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:31.709 region:rollup2
IN MY MILITARY EXPERIENCE.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:35.546 region:rollup2
WHEN NO ONE'S.

00:53:31.709 --> 00:53:38.082 region:rollup2
SHOOTING AT YOU YOU DIG DEEPER.

00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:39.650 region:rollup2

SO.

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:48.559 region:rollup2
I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE WE

00:53:48.025 --> 00:53:52.262 region:rollup2
SHOULD REINFORCE OUR PORT

00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:54.364 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:56.333 region:rollup2
BEFORE EVERYTHING GETS SOME

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:58.469 region:rollup2
REALLY WEIRD IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:53:56.333 --> 00:54:00.671 region:rollup2
.

00:53:58.469 --> 00:54:02.506 region:rollup2
THAT WAY WE CAN SUPPORT A HIGHER

00:54:00.671 --> 00:54:06.043 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

00:54:02.506 --> 00:54:08.312 region:rollup2
OF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.

00:54:06.043 --> 00:54:10.047 region:rollup2
THEN OTHER COUNTRIES BECAUSE.

00:54:08.312 --> 00:54:12.015 region:rollup2
THE NEXT RECESSION BECOMES WILL

00:54:10.047 --> 00:54:15.552 region:rollup2
BE WORLD WIDE.

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:18.555 region:rollup2
AND CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO COMPETE.

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:20.524 region:rollup2
BOTTOM. AND THE TOP.

00:54:18.555 --> 00:54:24.528 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THIS THING.

00:54:20.524 --> 00:54:27.731 region:rollup2
PRETTY DARN GOOD.

00:54:24.528 --> 00:54:29.833 region:rollup2
AND MY LAST WORDS ARE.

00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:32.903 region:rollup2
