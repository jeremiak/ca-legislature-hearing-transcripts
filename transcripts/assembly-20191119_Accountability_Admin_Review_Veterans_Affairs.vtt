00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:12.679
real area of focus as many you

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:53.453
first the scope and scale of

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.221

this issue- and another

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:02.662

affairs I'm familiar with the

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:32.725
state level. Birds are you a

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:33.359

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:38.765
Veterans into shelter or

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:40.767
housing. And in fact I have a

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.635
bill that. Would ensure

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:52.979
Although I know my own

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:54.747

understanding of the homeless I

00:06:58.518 --> 00:06:59.018

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.820
what's going on in all fifty

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:02.955
eight other counties- the

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:04.957
opportunity doesn't come often

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:06.592
to dedicate so much time

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:07.226
interests to hearing in on the

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:08.895
gala ground perspective. Of

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:10.663
other communities and from

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.565

I'm an overview of the scope

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:16.796
and scale of an Orange County-

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:18.531
as assembly women Petrie-Norris

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:20.666
men can and in the two thousand

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:21.267
nineteen point in time how we

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.802
found and hundred and eleven

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.837
homeless veterans in our

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:26.439
community and that includes

00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:28.674
sheltered and I'm sheltered I'm

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:29.275
the twenty nineteen point in

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.576
time count was really a key

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:32.612
moment for Orange County in

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.547
order to be able to understand

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:36.482
current homelessness but we did

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.016
with an actual account and

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.417
implemented new methodology.

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:40.786
That included the use of our

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:42.555
gas technologies everyone to

00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:44.891
three so we can locate where

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:46.692
veterans aren't I'm and return

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:47.260
to those three pots and out

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:48.728
reach to them we also

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:52.598
incorporated half sheet in

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:53.232
which we collect that thirteen

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:54.867
person identifying data points

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:56.736
for the better and that would

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:58.771
help us understand and follow

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:00.439
up with them future outreach

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:02.508
efforts. That their name the

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:03.009
veteran status branch of

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:04.610
service character of this

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.445
charge and any other additional

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:07.046
like contact details that they

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:14.487
were willing to share. We were

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:20.459
really excited that. Of those.

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:20.993
Two hundred and twelve out

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:21.527
reach during the sheltered

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:22.862
count- approximately half of

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:23.462
them provided that information

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:24.697
for us. That was often

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:25.264
opportunity to reconcile our

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.799
veteran registry. And the

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:29.001
veteran registry list is the by

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.970
name list of all the veterans

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:31.604
in Orange County I and eight is

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:32.705
populated by all the street

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:34.740
outreach workers nonprofit

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:36.742
fifties- that conduct our

00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:38.711
region our community and that

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:40.446
encounter veterans and that way

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:41.080
we are able to follow up with

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:42.715
them and see their progress

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:44.483
towards helping make sure that

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.084
we connect those veteran to a

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:46.752
case manager- healthy

00:09:46.819 --> 00:09:48.788
navigation services the- able

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:52.758
to transition out of homes

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:53.259
that. An active support.

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:56.595
Resource. I'm going back live

00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:58.831
it to the point in time cap and

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.666
as you mentioned it was three.

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:01.267
In the lab and veterans. This

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:02.802
represents roughly 3% of the

00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:04.537
homeless population in all of

00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:07.073
Orange County I'm which the

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:08.441
nineteen point in time cannot.

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:10.810
Found. Six thousand eight

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:12.445
hundred sixty individuals

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:13.045
experiencing homelessness in

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:14.647
Orange County. I am and we have

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:16.582
the opportunity to also do a

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.684
deeper dive on that. The

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:20.920
populations and demographics of

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:24.590
the veterans- so we found that.

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:26.459
Of the veterans bring think

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:28.728
almost of the majority of them-

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:31.030
near over a quarter of them our

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:32.732
seniors their sixty two years

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:36.469
of age and older after we have

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:37.069
an aging population of that.

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:40.439
Marking unity. At the majority

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:41.040
of the homeless veterans are

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:44.910
male approximately 90% of the

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:46.445
veterans I'm county during when

00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:48.748
in time county. I'm in nearly

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:49.382
half of them are experiencing

00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:50.916
chronic homelessness meaning

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:52.818
that they have been. On the

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:54.720
streets for a year longer and

00:10:54.787 --> 00:11:02.428
have a disabling condition. I'm

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:03.029
that also makes them eligible

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:06.632
for the high fashion. Which is

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:08.834
showing that we have the

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:09.402
adequate resources to help.

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:10.770
Veteran homelessness- and then

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.738
others the populations are

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:14.607
characters is of our veterans

00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:16.542
and we noticed that. Nearly one

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:17.109
in five veterans reported a

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:20.579
mental health issue. And one

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:21.180
third of our press reported a

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:21.747
physical disability. And one

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:24.683
quarter. Veterans reported

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.554
having substance use issues.

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:29.088
After having this detail

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:30.756
information of the populations

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:32.591
than other demographics allows

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:33.092
an opportunity to tailor

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:34.960
services to the veterans and

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:36.796
stand and the connections that

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:37.463
we need to make to with them to

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.866
other support services. To

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:41.467
ensure that they- are able to

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:48.507
receive the care that they need.

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:50.609
Over time I'm Orange County has

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:52.812
had focus in addressing veteran

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:54.513
homelessness and like other

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.682
communities in the nation I

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:57.216
have been successful in

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:58.818
decreasing veteran home last

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.786
I'm so proud of two thousand

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:02.822
nineteen to do that then I mean

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:06.725
sorry from two thousand fifteen

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:07.326
to two thousand nineteen there

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:08.994
was. A 34% decrease in veteran

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:12.765
homelessness. And sent the

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:15.034
point in time county now which

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.635
is approximately. Like ten

00:12:16.702 --> 00:12:19.004
months I have we have seen a

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.739
15% decrease in veteran

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:24.610
homelessness I'm just by really

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:26.745
targeting are offered and- care

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:32.485
for the veterans. The going

00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:34.787
forward we will continue- to

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:37.056
manage the veteran registry the

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:38.757
veteran registry the mention of

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:40.659
the by name of all right to

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:42.528
experiencing homelessness an

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:46.565
Orange County- and these folks

00:12:46.632 --> 00:12:47.199
are. At the mention are entered

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.868
by a street outreach teams and

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:50.803
community organizations after

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.805
the number of the veteran

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:54.673
registry will fluctuate over

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.375
time as we are reach to more

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:56.976
friends and as veterans get

00:12:57.042 --> 00:13:00.713
house- but we have a downward

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:02.748
trend which means that. Meeting

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:04.683
our efforts I'm is definitely

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.919
helping. I and this veteran

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:08.387

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.623
so we have weekly meetings to

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:12.825
be able to contact the follow

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:14.660
up and make sure that we don't.

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:16.629
Have any veterans fall through

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:20.799
the cracks. Or that were able

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:24.503
to our reach to them properly.

out there I see some familiar

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:16.555
faces that have been working on

00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:18.791
veterans issues for quite a

00:14:18.857 --> 00:14:20.993
long time and on housing issues

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.628
the two issues. Are coincide

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.064
and have been part of the work

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.767
that I've been doing I. Always

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:31.036
is an exile yeah opportunity to

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:32.605
learn more myself about these

00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:34.773
two issues but also went on I

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.976
have Gaines information to

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:38.978
share it's all just take one up

00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:40.813
point to privilege here I was

00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:42.581
had the opportunity yesterday

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:46.852
to- go to the campus of cal

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:50.689
poly. Which is out of my

00:14:50.756 --> 00:14:51.257
district but ana was invited

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:52.825
for tour there and was able to

00:14:52.891 --> 00:14:56.495
go to the veteran center there

00:14:56.562 --> 00:15:02.468
resource center- which is ca.

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:05.104
Well rounded place very active.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.839
And spoke to a few of the

00:15:06.905 --> 00:15:08.907
veterans firsthand and of the

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:09.475
things again that I've heard

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:12.678
cents my days as being chair of

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.014
Veterans Committee. It is where

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.548
are we not making the

00:15:16.615 --> 00:15:18.417
connection for veterans once

00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:20.753
they leave- we've talked about

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:24.423
the taps program their program

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:25.024
when they leave and it was a

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.126
very stained remarks that I've

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:28.627
heard really for the last

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:30.996
almost six years that. When

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:32.831
they are ready to leave and

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:33.332
they're going to their

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:36.769
orientation program that they

00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:38.771
just want to get home. SO some

00:15:38.837 --> 00:15:39.338
of the last things they're

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:41.073
thinking about is all the

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.741
paperwork and how to make the

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:46.779
connections. It isn't sometimes

00:15:46.845 --> 00:15:50.783
until. A handful of months

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:56.955
later. At the connections have

00:15:57.022 --> 00:15:57.623
been lost so even through that

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.957
very short dialogue one of the

00:15:59.024 --> 00:15:59.558
things that we try to get back

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:00.659
to is how can we- if you want

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:04.830
to say. Figure out a way to get

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:08.801
that connection so that when

00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:09.401
they are ready for it because

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.569
you can't make them- just if

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:13.105
you want to say go directly to

00:16:13.172 --> 00:16:16.442
a benefits officer if they're

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:18.744
not ready for that but- of the

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.612
same kind of advice was given

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:22.748
the you know reconnecting so

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.117
forth but one is to use some of

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:28.554
the social media and-

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.656
information and our phone.

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:32.591
Which is perhaps get veterans

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.860
that have been there already

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:36.328
and then maybe it six months

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.764
after they returned home more a

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.499
year and all of a sudden now

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:41.100
they're ready but they're not

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:43.035
sure how to navigate and for

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.903
them to actually do a little

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.072
testimony so that that could be

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:50.743
pushed out there too veterans

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.411
so that they can actually see

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:54.780
firsthand. That maybe within

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.515
the first two months four

00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:58.884
months six months are not ready

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:00.552
for that information. But a

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:02.755
year later and so they can get

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:04.623
first hand testimony which is.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.492
A live video something like

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:07.092
that that's pushed out to them

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:10.529
somehow- through an email or a

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:14.533
text message so they can see

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.200
that okay now I'm ready this is

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:16.568
what I need to do. Because

00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:17.169
sometimes we talk about big

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:19.104
programs that cost a lot of

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:20.906
money. But this could be a very

00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:22.808
simple testimonies from

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.810
somebody who's working with the

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.678
navigation officer or with the

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:29.214
county veteran officer so that

00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:32.551
they can say I was finally

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:33.118
ready these are the steps I

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:36.555
took but its first hand. So

00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:37.189
that's just from yesterday that

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:38.857
Kalpoe E. but anyhow I look

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:42.628
forward thank you. Thank you

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:45.063
are will now hear from a couple

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.732
of local veterans who are

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.767
thanks for being here with that

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:51.036
Hey you're saying your purse

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:51.603
seven terms of transition

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.907
particularly in terms of. Our

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:56.508
housing challenges that you

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.811
face. Our our with a broken

00:17:58.877 --> 00:18:04.450
often. A good morning members

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:06.718
of the committee- good morning

00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:07.319
everyone thank you for having

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:08.787
me here to get- my name's Brian

00:18:08.854 --> 00:18:10.889
all. Of those in the United

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.958
States Marine Corps for about

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:13.525
four and a half years I was

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:16.628
eighteen twelve tanker. Twice

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:18.897
once the Middle East these-

00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:22.634
Asia. And I got out in two

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:26.705
thousand seventeen. When I got

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:28.574
out I had thought that I

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.174
planned everything out I had a

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:32.744
job lined up. I had a seven

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:36.448
thousand dollar savings- I just

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:38.784
I had everything lined up and

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.519
one of the reasons why. I think

00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:42.988
that I you know went through

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:44.923
these challenges was because of

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.492
circumstances that I couldn't

00:18:46.558 --> 00:18:48.894
quite control- they were out of

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:52.598
my hands. One of the biggest

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:56.502
reasons for me was is something

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:57.135
that they don't tell you about

00:18:57.202 --> 00:18:58.804
the GI is that it's not

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:00.772
considered stable income so

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:02.407
what I mean by that say. You

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:04.443
can't use it as proof of income

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.812
you can't use that as- safer

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:08.514
like pay stubs to qualify for

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.784
an apartment for a car or

00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:14.586
anything- yet when and you try

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:16.522
to apply for financial aid from

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:18.624
school or try to apply for

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.258
something like how fresh they

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:21.093
say that you make too much

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:22.794
money. So it kind of just cut

00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:24.963
at the knees. I got out with a

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.598
one year old daughter I had a

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:28.934
family- a lot of veterans to

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:31.203
come out you know by themselves

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.704
but then there's also veterans

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:35.040
that you'll come out with the

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:36.842
family. I have people that I a-

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:40.812
and responsible for so- I was

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:42.614
lucky enough to find an

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:43.248
apartment a four hundred square

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:46.785
foot studio. For fourteen

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:51.156
fifty. An Orange County in

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:56.695
Tustin. It was. A time of my

00:19:56.762 --> 00:20:00.666
life that I'd- made me a better

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:01.266
person- made me stronger but

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:02.601
it's a time period that don't

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:03.201
like to go back to because it

00:20:03.268 --> 00:20:06.605
was very hard. Partly due to

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:07.239
some of the restrictions of the

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:10.976
GI bill so. One of the rules

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:12.644
that they don't explain to you

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:14.746
is how the GI works for

00:20:14.813 --> 00:20:18.450
instance I got out my E. A. S.

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:20.786
for end of active service will

00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:21.353
temas sixteen two thousand

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.856
seventeen. I got out two months

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:25.457
ahead of time because I had a

00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:26.992
job I had you know a family out

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.527
of an apartment I to get

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:30.462
situated so I can have

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.631
everything lined up perfectly

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:34.566
and the rules stipulate with

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:36.868
the GI bill is a you have to be

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:38.737
out completely for an entire

00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:42.841
month. And yet you have to be.

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:43.408
For an entire month. So I

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:44.876
didn't actually get any type of

00:20:44.943 --> 00:20:47.045
income until December and I got

00:20:47.112 --> 00:20:48.880
out in August fourth- at seven

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:50.649
thousand dollars. In Orange

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:52.784
County does not last long

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:53.352
especially when you're you

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:56.488
know. You're monthly rent is

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:58.557
fourteen fifty that shows. You

00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:00.993
you don't just come out. Three

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:02.661
you still have. To store up

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:06.465
responsibilities. And so

00:21:06.531 --> 00:21:06.965
ultimately I was living

00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:10.602
paycheck to paycheck. I had a

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:12.971
job lined up as you know you

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:14.606
don't just get paid right away.

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:16.675
I you know. It was a very tough

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:19.144
situation for me- and also had

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:22.714
a kid out of one year old

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:23.315
daughter it was just something

00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:28.487
that. Eight it got really scary

00:21:28.553 --> 00:21:29.121
for me I thought for one minute

00:21:29.187 --> 00:21:30.789
thousand be living in my car.

00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:32.457
You know my family you know

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:34.593
something that. You know

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.728
contemplating you think how did

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:38.563
I get in the situation Iraq

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:39.131
planned everything out so

00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:40.732
perfectly. How did that get in

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.901
the situation your

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:43.468
circumstances that I just

00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:48.373
couldn't control I just had to.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:48.940
Make do with what I had you

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:52.611
know. Part of the biggest

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:53.245
reason why I think I've made it

00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:54.813
so far as obviously because my

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.583
daughter the love my dog but-

00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.217
the family that I found Irvine

00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:02.621
valley college- namely Nancy

00:22:02.688 --> 00:22:04.489
Montgomery who's been a-

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:05.057
guarding angel from and she-

00:22:05.123 --> 00:22:08.994
has. You know a lot of

00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:11.096
resources for me. That allowed

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:12.864
me to you know survive for the

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:16.802
past- you know markets. But

00:22:16.868 --> 00:22:18.704
yeah I just- you know part of

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.939
these parties problems are you

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:22.941
know things that they don't

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:24.843
quite explain and there's a lot

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.511
of yellow tape around these

00:22:26.578 --> 00:22:30.582
things and- how. How are you

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:32.784
supposed to you know make do

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:33.351
with the cost of living you

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:38.824
know this is. My client so.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.694
Part of what I think would help

00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:46.498
out is- finding a place where

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:48.667
you know veterans coming out of

00:22:48.734 --> 00:22:49.301
the service have somewhere to

00:22:49.367 --> 00:22:52.471
go somewhere where they can be

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:53.004
for like temporary housing

00:22:53.071 --> 00:22:56.374
somewhere they they can use for

00:22:56.441 --> 00:22:58.543
time short period where they

00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.211
can at least get on their knees

00:22:59.277 --> 00:23:00.779
you know not a okay back on

00:23:00.846 --> 00:23:04.616
their feet I should say. Yeah I

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:06.852
think looking back that would

00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:08.820
have helped a lot- I think.

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:12.691
About. The suicide the rates of

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:15.160
suicide for veterans I don't

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:15.794
want to sit here and say that

00:23:15.861 --> 00:23:18.697
the plate suicide but suicide

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:20.966
was a definitely options but

00:23:21.032 --> 00:23:22.534
you know there's certain things

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:24.803
you can't control you don't you

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:25.437
know what are you supposed to

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:28.807
do. And I've had a lot of

00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:32.744
friends a commit suicide at.

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:33.378
Outside of the service you know

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:36.915
and it's just. Can I consider

00:23:36.982 --> 00:23:38.717
myself one of the lucky ones

00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:40.685
because I had a good support

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:41.286
system around me a friend you

00:23:41.353 --> 00:23:44.990
know. Being from- far away from

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:47.058
my family Georgetown Kentucky

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:47.659
coming to Orange County all by

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:50.862
myself. It was it was pretty

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:54.900
hard but I'm here and I hope

00:23:54.966 --> 00:23:56.601
that my testimony can help

00:23:56.668 --> 00:23:57.202
bring light to the situation.

00:23:57.269 --> 00:24:08.880
Thank you. Christopher Abbott

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.916
as Christopher can we hear your

00:24:10.982 --> 00:24:18.690
perspective as well absolutely.

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:20.659
Absolutely thank you for mere

00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:22.961
gratitude of my take your Brian

00:24:23.028 --> 00:24:24.963
thank you for sharing a

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:25.463
compelling story as your

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:26.965
personal experiences my take is

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:30.836
really a little bit about my

00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:31.403
personal experience and the

00:24:31.469 --> 00:24:34.639
data. And at. So average

00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:37.275
household income this is a at a

00:24:37.342 --> 00:24:39.077
master's degree level to run AT

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:42.414
que roughly I'm estimated and

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.549
their their positions where

00:24:44.616 --> 00:24:46.685
like for example I have three

00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:48.954
kids I have a family of three

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.722
we were in housing and there

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:52.958
was a time when I was going to

00:24:53.024 --> 00:24:54.826
school full time and working

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:58.563
80% eighty like 80% of my time

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.632
was invested in my occupation

00:25:00.699 --> 00:25:02.434
which is a banking entry level

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.569
bachelor's degree position and

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:06.738
I was barely able to pay and

00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:10.709
for like at a one bedroom

00:25:10.775 --> 00:25:14.613
apartment. As a comparison. I

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:15.180
just imagine of the you know

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:18.416
from personal experience. How

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:19.017
much the Martine that gap has

00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:20.685
has shifted income is very

00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:24.489
consistent however the markets

00:25:24.556 --> 00:25:28.560
for. Has changed dramatically

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.829
right that there's a huge gap

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:32.530
meaning I was very fortunate. I

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:34.766
have to be very grateful

00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:35.400
because my wife's a veteran as

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:36.568
well I was the United States

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:38.703
Marine Corps she was as well so

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.572
I did have a little bit more

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:42.507
foundation I'm of I have a

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:44.542
family when I transition out of

00:25:44.609 --> 00:25:46.711
service. However I felt the

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:48.546
blow of the housing market the

00:25:48.613 --> 00:25:50.749
disparity between the income

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:52.717
verses- you know the

00:25:52.784 --> 00:25:55.086
credibility factor is that and

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:55.687
what it takes to survive in

00:25:55.754 --> 00:25:56.855
Orange County. So I do at the

00:25:56.922 --> 00:25:58.690
perspective like I said I have

00:25:58.757 --> 00:26:00.725
I have a ball for my wife was

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:02.794
on the GI bill as well I know

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:06.731
it's just extremely. Hard and

00:26:06.798 --> 00:26:08.800
might might take away is. The

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:09.401
pain points I want to say you

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:12.671
know. For contesting for

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.506
veterans and a providing

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:15.140
services a call to action would

00:26:15.206 --> 00:26:19.077
be to. Present some kind of

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:20.679
resource where but veterans

00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:22.480
that our tradition

00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:24.649
transitioning are getting

00:26:24.716 --> 00:26:26.918
suitable. Housing situations

00:26:26.985 --> 00:26:29.020
situation maybe a partnership

00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:32.524
amongst different communities

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.158
to housing these veterans going

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:34.592
to this transition process

00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:36.528
because the fact is it is

00:26:36.594 --> 00:26:40.498
extremely hard out there to

00:26:40.565 --> 00:26:42.801
have a family for example and

00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:44.636
to pay your rants. On such a

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:46.771
low standard of income when

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:48.440
housing market just keeps

00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:48.974
increasing in income this

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.742
relatively stays the same I

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:52.777
apologize a little bit from my

00:26:52.844 --> 00:26:54.779
scattered- scattered speech are

00:26:54.846 --> 00:26:58.950
the. Burns was there and it was

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:02.520
very hard for my family. And

00:27:02.587 --> 00:27:03.154
movie for I think there is you

00:27:03.221 --> 00:27:04.889
better solutions provide for

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:06.758
veterans such as Brian

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:08.660
transitioning out of service

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:10.528
trying to ascend himself in

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:12.464
society get to a much higher

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.666
degree level and cutting

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:16.568
through the noise of. Pain for

00:27:16.634 --> 00:27:18.570
housing taking care of a family

00:27:18.636 --> 00:27:20.438
going to school battling all

00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:21.006
the depression and all the

00:27:21.072 --> 00:27:22.474
personal experiences and all

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.542
the battles that they have you

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:26.611
know internally and also

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:28.546
keeping like moving that ball

00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:30.515
that Neil for in their life so

00:27:30.582 --> 00:27:32.917
that's thank you for your time

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:33.518
thank you for. Hearing me out

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:38.490
and that's my speech. Thank you.

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:42.861
That race the Carrera. Good

00:27:42.927 --> 00:27:44.662

allow me to be in front of you

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:51.102
guys a little trouble myself my

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:52.937
name's residents- I served in

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:56.441
the United States Navy I was

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:58.343
eighty which is a- mechanic-

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.678
I'm attending IBC right now

00:28:00.745 --> 00:28:02.680
looking for to transfer to

00:28:02.747 --> 00:28:03.281
pursue a degree in mechanical

00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:06.618
engineering- I'm I'm currently

00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:08.486
using my GI benefits and

00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:09.120
currently also do work city at

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.922
school at school in about

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:12.857
center- I was born and raised

00:28:12.924 --> 00:28:14.793
in Savannah. And that is

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:16.928
actually were aye when move

00:28:16.995 --> 00:28:18.596
back right now to help my mom

00:28:18.663 --> 00:28:20.565
into their brothers to aye

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:24.869
financially. Support them as

00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:25.470
much as I can right now on my

00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:28.807
way back home. After returning

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:30.608
back from the service- today- I

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:31.209
just want to bring up three of

00:28:31.276 --> 00:28:31.810
the biggest issues that have

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:32.610
been calendar. Since you

00:28:32.677 --> 00:28:34.546
leaving and it's affordability.

00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:36.681
Accessibility and

00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:38.550
discrimination. Affordability

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:40.652
there's no rent control in

00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:42.887
Orange County. And with that

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:43.455
being said- as you've been

00:28:43.521 --> 00:28:44.556
hearing but these my to Bob.

00:28:44.622 --> 00:28:48.827
Veterans the little- are they

00:28:48.893 --> 00:28:49.360
they've experienced a an

00:28:49.427 --> 00:28:50.728
increase or rent. So there's

00:28:50.795 --> 00:28:52.597
really no control and the

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:54.666
landlords have pretty much most

00:28:54.732 --> 00:28:56.367
of the power. And the deciding

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:56.935
how much rent you know they

00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:58.736
could raise up. And I

00:28:58.803 --> 00:29:00.472
understand that if it's more

00:29:00.538 --> 00:29:02.373
than 10% they do have to do a

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:02.941
sixty day notice but there's

00:29:03.007 --> 00:29:04.843
really no control over how much

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:06.544
money they could raise it up-

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:07.078
recently I experience of

00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:10.949
flooding in August nineteen.

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:11.516
And with that you know I've

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:14.886
been. Momentarily this place

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:15.487
where we're kind of just look

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:16.788
in the little room us all four

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:18.656
together. And with that being

00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:19.257
said he the landlord already

00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:20.859
kinda hit to us that he will

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:22.961
raise or by more than twenty

00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:24.529
percent- because of the

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:28.366
renovations and he's doing-

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:28.933
concert with me with that is

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.136
that. That is a- a lot of like

00:29:31.202 --> 00:29:32.770
a maintenance in the area where

00:29:32.837 --> 00:29:34.906
I live in the apartment complex

00:29:34.973 --> 00:29:36.674
and I live in the- live close

00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:38.576
to send out a high school so

00:29:38.643 --> 00:29:40.578
it's nine two seven zero one.

00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:41.146
It's going to be one of the

00:29:41.212 --> 00:29:42.647
lower income on a as an Orange

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:44.849
County. And of some of the

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:47.118
concerns that I have is that

00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:48.953
on. He actually has an

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.822
apartment upstairs that he

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:54.492
reserves like Airbnb. I don't

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:56.461
know that is legal I have done

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:57.095
a couple of you research and I

00:29:57.162 --> 00:29:58.963
have yet to follow and like

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.365
find the code that says that

00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:02.800
that is okay to do- that also

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:04.669
brings me down to the says

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:06.504
ability- second concern that I

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:08.706
have been with that is that- I.

00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:10.708
Have been seen a an increase.

00:30:10.775 --> 00:30:12.477
And auto but short term rentals

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:14.879
in the area. And I understand

00:30:14.946 --> 00:30:16.514
that a certain cities it are

00:30:16.581 --> 00:30:18.616
clear it is very clear fight in

00:30:18.683 --> 00:30:20.585
the states that it is legal.

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:21.186
But in Santa Ana itself but I

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:22.420
haven't done the will and

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:26.724
research to. To find it- so

00:30:26.791 --> 00:30:28.359
with that we live next I live

00:30:28.426 --> 00:30:28.893
next to touching like the

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.463
fences and a high school- with

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:33.064
that with the Airbnb I don't

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:36.634
know. Who is going in and out.

00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:38.469
It could be a pet a file a

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:40.638
sexual you know harasser.

00:30:40.705 --> 00:30:41.172
There's really no control

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:42.840
through those. Those apps-

00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:44.876
who's going in and out of. That

00:30:44.943 --> 00:30:46.945
apartment so that is my

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.580
concern. With that and also

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:50.648
others a lot of renovations but

00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:51.216
I don't see inspectors out

00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:52.717
there. I don't know their

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:54.752
building without permit and I

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:56.487
and I understand that since

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:57.121
it's a lower income area a lot

00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:59.023
of people are free to speak up

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.391
and actually bring up certain

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:08.733
situations like that. And that

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.839
is why. You know a lot- you

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:16.908
know people in my area they get

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:17.542
they speak up and they just as

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:18.610
were in a month to month lease.

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:19.177
That's very common also an

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:20.812
Orange County- we just. We get

00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:21.412
elected. So I am afraid I am

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:23.147
afraid that if I actually say

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:23.748
something go to the city. You

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:24.816
know. I'm gonna get evicted and

00:31:24.882 --> 00:31:26.884
where am I gonna go with my

00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:27.452
family my mom in the cooler

00:31:27.518 --> 00:31:30.788
weather. Another another point

00:31:30.855 --> 00:31:31.422
with the sensibility is the VA

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:32.824
loan. I actually attempted to

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.692
purchase a small condo under

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:35.293
three hundred thousand because

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.828
I know that's something that I

00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:40.531
could possibly afford. And the-

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:41.165
the issue with that was that

00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:44.569
the VA loan dozen- they don't

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:46.537
count your GI income. They

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:48.706
don't count it as income. Seoul

00:31:48.773 --> 00:31:50.575
this is not stable so that that

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:52.710
idea was off the- my list. The

00:31:52.777 --> 00:31:54.946
other thing that I attempted to

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:56.681
do especially with the

00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:58.516
frustration with the flooding.

00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:00.652
Was you know research research

00:32:00.718 --> 00:32:02.620
for a low income housing. They

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:03.187
say I make too much money

00:32:03.254 --> 00:32:06.391
because they count the GI bill

00:32:06.457 --> 00:32:06.924
as income. So for federal

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:08.760
programs they count. GI bill as

00:32:08.826 --> 00:32:12.497
income but- for a VA loan I can

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:13.131
buy a home because they don't

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:14.832
count as income so I'm kind of

00:32:14.899 --> 00:32:18.569
stuck in the middle. I decided

00:32:18.636 --> 00:32:23.007
to what to do. The last thing

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:24.842
that I want to talk about this

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:25.443
discrimination. I've actually

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:26.611
experience I know that a

00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:29.013
there's a certain image that

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:29.614
some people have veterans or

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:30.548
disabled veterans. And what

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:33.051
that you know over up personal

00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:34.686
experience that I've experience

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:38.656
was- my landlord- I asked if he

00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:39.223
could. Keep it down in the

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.658
construction after a certain

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:42.727
amount of time- due to- you

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:45.063
know so you know certain mental

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:46.764
you know. Issues that I

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:48.633
experience and I cannot

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.535
tolerate like really loud

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:51.102
noise. Especially late at

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:54.906
night. And he actually couple

00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:58.643
questions. And I quote. But I

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:59.210
didn't think you. Want to

00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:02.747
combat. So being a woman being

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:04.882
in the navy. You know people

00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:06.884
have their own pictures or even

00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:07.518
just as a veteran to have their

00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:10.922
pictures. Of what issues they

00:33:10.988 --> 00:33:12.757
actually have because I might

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:14.692
seem normal you know we might

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:16.994
seem okay you know physically

00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:18.396
right up front of you. But the

00:33:18.463 --> 00:33:23.134
you know. A lot of people don't

00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:23.735
know what goes on in our head

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:28.439
when we're alone. And I just.

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:30.742
In conclusion I just you know I

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:32.610
just want you guys to my

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:33.244
experiences with you know with

00:33:33.311 --> 00:33:34.545
housing as a veteran of the

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:35.146
three issues that I encounter

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:36.848
are portability USCIS ability

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:38.616
in discrimination I might not

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:39.217
be homeless now what of these

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:42.820
issues remain me and- veterans

00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:43.421
responding up in the streets.

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:46.424

00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:51.429
important perspective as we

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:54.599

00:33:54.665 --> 00:33:55.199

00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:02.707
against for your service when

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:04.642
you come out of the military.

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:06.911
We need to ensure that at. We

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:10.515
don't. We don't just talk about

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:11.048
honoring our veterans on

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:12.917

is why we are here. Today. Any

three of you for sure answers I

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:34.872
had one quick question Brian is

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:38.543
the best to. Answer that. We

00:34:38.609 --> 00:34:40.945
are always cause concern

00:34:41.012 --> 00:34:41.579
transitions and how do we make

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:42.847
sure that. When you leave the

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:45.049
service that you receive all

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:46.617
the information you need to

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:48.853
know all the back. Your title

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.523
to did you visit a CVS so or

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.992
did you get your information on

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:58.496
your- college. Or did did you

00:34:58.563 --> 00:34:59.063
participate in the cal cap

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.932
program any of those resource-

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:04.869
so in the last year that was in

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:05.470
the marine corps I tended to

00:35:05.536 --> 00:35:06.571
summon are called to TRS

00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:08.606
seminar which all marines are

00:35:08.673 --> 00:35:12.677
supposed to take- it's-

00:35:12.743 --> 00:35:16.681
transition readiness. Me I

00:35:16.747 --> 00:35:18.749
don't remember the last the

00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:19.317
last name of it- but yes I

00:35:19.383 --> 00:35:20.818
attended it was a week long and

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:22.820
what it is that you go through-

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:24.822
possible job so you can get-

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:26.958
that according to your- job in

00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:28.626
the marine corps- the other.

00:35:28.693 --> 00:35:30.962
Part it was your benefits

00:35:31.028 --> 00:35:34.499
package- what you qualify for

00:35:34.565 --> 00:35:36.601
what you can qualify for

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:38.636
incoming now- and- you're

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:42.773
supposed to get. Eight months

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.307
before you get out of the

00:35:43.374 --> 00:35:46.511
marine corps and then your push

00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:48.779
back in two years the person

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:50.748
you know go pick up drive will

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:54.819
stand guard whatever. It is

00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:56.454
it's kind of just ridiculous

00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:58.789
it's kind of a check in the box

00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:04.495
if- I have learned more about-

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:06.631
the things that qualify from

00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:07.231
veterans from word of mouth.

00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:09.100
That have from these TRS

00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:10.935
programs I've heard the same

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:12.637
thing from you know other

00:36:12.703 --> 00:36:15.039
service members such as and not

00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:15.673
you know being in the army and

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.908
the navy of all said the same

00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:18.776
thing I've- learned more. About

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:22.847
some of these- programs through

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:26.751
friends people who- you know

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:27.251
who are far the VSO or

00:36:27.318 --> 00:36:30.488
something like that have told

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:36.894
me about it so. Thank you.

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:37.428
Again thank you for your

00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:39.230
testimony but- another way to

00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:40.965
say testimony is you stories

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:42.800
and there they are child and

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:46.804
real and- everything that you

00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:49.106
mentioned about how seen an

00:36:49.173 --> 00:36:50.841
Orange County is absolutely

00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:54.545
true and I think made harder.

00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:58.449
By as your story that you get-

00:36:58.516 --> 00:37:00.651
repeat to come back- from the

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:01.218
appointment and now have to

00:37:01.285 --> 00:37:04.488
access everything from banking

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:06.891
two two jobs all at the same

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:08.693
time so my take away on this is

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:10.728
going to be. To work with my

00:37:10.795 --> 00:37:12.830
partners up here too I don't

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:14.432
believe that we do have

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:16.867
transitional housing at all and

00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:20.671
even the short term. Could be a

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:22.840
possible a pilot program here

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:26.577
in Orange County. That you know

00:37:26.644 --> 00:37:27.211
like you said even if it's a

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:28.946
three month and then another

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:32.717
type of housing after that but

00:37:32.783 --> 00:37:34.986
I think that three months on

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:38.456
ticket to. If you haven't

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:40.358
already worked with the CVS so

00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:42.860
or if you still have questions

00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:44.762
but even to clarify what led

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:46.364
you said about your benefits

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.633
what you can use them for

00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:49.333
because it does look like it's

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.570
a double edged sword where on

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:54.538
the one hand it helps you. Two

00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:56.841
but on the other hand- they

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:58.943
don't take it into account as

00:37:59.010 --> 00:37:59.577
far as a bank loan so those are

00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:02.513
certainly things that. You know

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.114
some of it federal government

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:06.717
but some of it at the state. We

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:08.519
certainly can look into and

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:10.588
that's exactly why these

00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:12.690
hearings are so important is

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:14.592
for us to gain information but

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:16.761
as I opened with where I'm Y.

00:38:16.827 --> 00:38:18.729
remarks is. Even us and I know

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:19.363
we have it because it's being

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:22.767
recorded but even a snapshot of

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.635
your testimony I think could be

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:26.704
very valuable- to the young

00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:29.106
military personnel that are

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:32.576
exiting because your saying

00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:33.177
what's happened to you from

00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:34.779
experience. And some of those

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:36.714
that type of testimony I think

00:38:36.781 --> 00:38:38.983
is very valuable because as I

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.818
noted when you're exiting

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:42.953
you're thinking of everything

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.889
about. You know how you're

00:38:44.955 --> 00:38:45.556
going to set up a home for your

00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:46.757
young daughter or where you're

00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:48.726
going to locate to sell all the

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:50.961
intricacies. An orientation to

00:38:51.028 --> 00:38:52.830
you're not probably paying

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:54.965
attention to but if there's a

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:56.567
first hand testimony from

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:58.869
another officer like you said a

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:00.838
word of mouth that may have

00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:04.575
much more impact. For you for

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:06.477
those exiting than a binder

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:11.182
full of- information and both

00:39:11.248 --> 00:39:11.782
combined I think could be very

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:19.023
valuable. Thank you again.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:19.623
Thank you so much for joining

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:20.091
us I will go ahead and

00:39:20.157 --> 00:39:22.960
transition. Thank you. Right I

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:27.164
would. But now lives to call up

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:30.735
our second panel the first we

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:32.803
have a steep pack who is the

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.907
president of US backs. And then

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:38.609
we have to keep Portland who's

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:40.544
the deputy secretary of

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:44.949
veteran's services for Calvet.

00:39:45.015 --> 00:39:46.684
And Nancy Montgomery who is the

00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:48.753
assistant dean health wellness

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:50.621
and better service is Irvine

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:54.492
valley college. And finally

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:54.992
hiding Marshall managing

00:39:55.059 --> 00:40:00.598
director. Riverside county.

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:01.198
Riverside county something I'm

00:40:01.265 --> 00:40:06.771
sure. Allen thank you all for

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:22.987
joining us today

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:26.791
. And why don't

00:40:26.857 --> 00:40:27.324
we go ahead and start with

00:40:27.391 --> 00:40:38.836
Mister. Much. A good morning of

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:42.740
my name is Steven pack on the.

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:44.441
I should president and CEO of

00:40:44.508 --> 00:40:46.710
your steps I'm also a Vietnam

00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:48.612
veteran. And I've been working

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:49.079
with homeless veterans

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:50.781
assistance in nineteen ninety

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:52.950
one. I bit down Orange County

00:40:53.017 --> 00:40:54.852
several times in the past years

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:56.720
that you have as- Orange County

00:40:56.787 --> 00:40:58.656
of struggle as many counties

00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:00.925
have without their homeless

00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:03.027
veteran issue. I within the US

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:04.495
has been serving up veterans

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:10.634
since nineteen ninety three- we

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:11.268
started in Los Angeles that are

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:12.736
in the website. And now have

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.972
expanded to eleven different

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:16.373
communities across country the

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.210
house. About fifty five hundred

00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:19.677
dead better ends and

00:41:19.743 --> 00:41:20.945
everything. They have a variety

00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:24.815
of programs response to the

00:41:24.882 --> 00:41:25.382
homeless crisis that we all

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:28.552
face. I'm also the president of

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:30.754
the California search veterans

00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:32.423
service agencies seven agencies.

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:34.525
And are California- providing

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:36.293
housing and services from

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:44.702
Eureka to San Diego. Level two

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:48.639
of benefit to veterans. Right

00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:50.774
now are Orange County like of

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:54.545
most county are- offering from

00:41:54.612 --> 00:41:56.413
a shortage of affordable

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.047
housing you're always more or

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:59.049
of veterans and other homeless

00:41:59.116 --> 00:42:01.418
people becoming homeless and-

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:04.455
then there's nothing available

00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:05.055
so it is obvious to us that

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:07.124
housing own is not the answer

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.692
when you need a variety of

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:12.596
solutions- with your three

00:42:12.663 --> 00:42:13.230
hundred or so almost veterans-

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:15.199
you can multiply that by two

00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:17.001
and a half so. And comes out to

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:18.869
about a thousand veterans are

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:20.404
experiencing homeless

00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:22.640
homelessness- every year- so we

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:28.812
have to attack. This problem

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:29.380
from a variety of different

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:34.518
angles. US vets has a

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:35.085
transitional housing program

00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:36.654
both both transitional and

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.722
bridge programs. Of we have

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:40.524
almost prevention programs- and

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:41.158
a permanent support of housing

00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:42.860
programs- and between the three

00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:43.460
of those we hope that we will

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:46.497
get ahead of this problem. Of

00:42:46.563 --> 00:42:47.131
the trend transitional housing

00:42:47.197 --> 00:42:50.501
programs. Are largely funded by

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:52.670
the a grant and per diem

00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:53.270
program that the program has

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:55.005
been flat line. Across the

00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:56.473
country but the transitional

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.575
housing gives us the funding to

00:42:58.642 --> 00:42:59.109
hire more staff so we can

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:00.511
provide more intensive services

00:43:00.577 --> 00:43:02.413
those are rehabilitation

00:43:02.479 --> 00:43:04.648
programs. For a while I think

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:05.215
transition hasn't got a bad

00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:06.984
name it was you know ninety

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:08.519
days route ten people were

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:09.153
getting into permanent housing

00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:12.589
but- of the way a- we have

00:43:12.656 --> 00:43:13.057
redesigned as he a as

00:43:13.123 --> 00:43:14.858
redesigned program is that.

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.794
Instead of the behavior health

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.729
assessments we are doing

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:20.864
housing tests how do we get

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:24.668
them- into housing. Of veterans

00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:26.470
have a variety of issues.

00:43:26.537 --> 00:43:28.806
Before they become homeless you

00:43:28.872 --> 00:43:33.010
could be of- lack of a job the

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:33.644
could subsidies could be mental

00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:34.578
illness. Of opportunity lack of

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:36.914
employment of a whole variety

00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:37.548
of things that we have to deal

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:38.916
with those issues- really

00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:40.784
before stabilizer the veterans

00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:42.653
that's why. We feel- and we

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.287
also advocate that transitional

00:43:43.354 --> 00:43:44.989
housing programs are are a key

00:43:45.055 --> 00:43:54.798
part of this continuing. To get

00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:55.432
veterans from the street into a

00:43:55.499 --> 00:44:00.571
program house. But we also need

00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:01.138
to look up stream. To homes

00:44:01.205 --> 00:44:02.840
prevention. Of because of

00:44:02.906 --> 00:44:04.641
veterans are becoming homeless

00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:06.610
every day Los Angeles three or

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:07.244
four day are becoming homeless

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:08.579
are dropping and homelessness

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:09.179
so we obviously have to get

00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:10.714
ahead of that and provide the

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:12.850
services that we provide a

00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:14.651
rocket mental health and

00:44:14.718 --> 00:44:15.219
employment services. Knowing

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:15.819
that those are two of the key

00:44:15.886 --> 00:44:18.922
factors- that are resulting in

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:20.724
a homelessness- US vets

00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:22.559
provides health counseling at a

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:24.495
through or outside the wire

00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:26.864
program at seven our community

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.732
colleges in order county- and

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:29.333
another seven in- Los Angeles

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.669
county. And there we are

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:33.203
providing mental health

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.005
counseling to veterans who have

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:38.742
just come back from department

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:39.376
of our community colleges their

00:44:39.443 --> 00:44:40.778
first step. But there's no way

00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:42.946
that they really don't know

00:44:43.013 --> 00:44:44.548
what happens beyond that in a

00:44:44.615 --> 00:44:46.817
lot of them are are suffering

00:44:46.884 --> 00:44:47.451
from come back home and we want

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:48.786
to make sure that they deal

00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:50.654
with that early on- we're

00:44:50.721 --> 00:44:52.823
providing case management. To

00:44:52.890 --> 00:45:02.566
help them navigate- the. There

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:08.772
post service career. Knowing

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:10.474
that- some of them are dropped

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:11.041
into a community and really

00:45:11.108 --> 00:45:12.810
don't know what's what steps to

00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:14.645
take next in order to. Move

00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:15.212
forward and we're providing

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:20.551
counseling to the families.

00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:23.053
Families are dealing with- some

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.988
with commentator ends who have.

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:27.057
Are greatly disturbed by their

00:45:27.124 --> 00:45:28.959
I'm in combat and we want to

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:32.663
help the family address that.

00:45:32.729 --> 00:45:34.765
There's a very high suicide

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:35.299
rate among both men but a

00:45:35.365 --> 00:45:40.804
particularly. Women the veteran

00:45:40.871 --> 00:45:42.606
of suicide rate is six to

00:45:42.673 --> 00:45:43.240
twelve times higher than their

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:45.109
sickly under parts of so it is

00:45:45.175 --> 00:45:46.877
really important that we

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.846
provide discounts going on in a

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:50.714
Broadway are are outside the

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:52.749
program was has been privately

00:45:52.816 --> 00:45:55.052
funded for the five years that

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:58.589
we run it just past year Orange

00:45:58.655 --> 00:45:59.223
County department mental health

00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:00.624
is picked up that funding I

00:46:00.691 --> 00:46:02.459
think it is critical that all

00:46:02.526 --> 00:46:02.926
counties look at their

00:46:02.993 --> 00:46:04.461
prevention early intervention

00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:05.095
so that they can provide this

00:46:05.162 --> 00:46:06.964
counseling to both male and a

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.932
female veterans. Along with the

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:10.767
shortage of mental health

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:12.936
services there's a shortage of

00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:18.575
employment dollars always- as

00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:20.410
though there's the VP program

00:46:20.477 --> 00:46:23.113
our problem the state is moved

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.650
around from- agency to agency

00:46:26.717 --> 00:46:28.485
there ever enough to go around

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:29.019
and so it's a very stable

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:35.159
program- and getting a job. Is

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:38.629
one of the key. Issues that we

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:39.196
can handle to make sure that

00:46:39.263 --> 00:46:39.630
veterans dog Fala to

00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:42.733
homelessness. And fine is a

00:46:42.799 --> 00:46:43.267
primitive supporting half

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:44.601
supporter housing- in

00:46:44.668 --> 00:46:46.637
California now there is a lot

00:46:46.703 --> 00:46:48.505
of money available for. A

00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:48.939
homeless to for the

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:49.439
construction of homeless

00:46:49.506 --> 00:46:50.941
veterans housing- and are we

00:46:51.008 --> 00:46:52.643
really have to take advantage

00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:54.645
of that- locating these are

00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:56.914
permits for the projects in the

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.049
county of provides a number of

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:02.586
nodes of- intensive services.

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:04.555
And really stabilizes the

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:06.456
entire homeless veteran that

00:47:06.523 --> 00:47:10.494
situation by locating the so-

00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:11.028
because this money at them

00:47:11.094 --> 00:47:14.731
we're I think we're and- round

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:16.967
five. Around five we're gonna

00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:17.568
try to get it we're gonna try

00:47:17.634 --> 00:47:18.202
to get some more fun after that

00:47:18.268 --> 00:47:18.869
but- we have a couple more

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:19.469
rounds before this this run

00:47:19.536 --> 00:47:21.004
this my expires we have all

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:24.808
have to be aggressive to go out

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:25.409
and get this money and build a

00:47:25.475 --> 00:47:25.909
housing that's going to

00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:26.710
stabilize. The homeless

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:28.545
veterans in our community- I

00:47:28.612 --> 00:47:30.948
mention Kassar our state-

00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:34.718
advocacy agency- we have been

00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:35.285
advocating for a number of

00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:38.789
years now our initially- about

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:39.389
appointment we are one of the

00:47:39.456 --> 00:47:42.693
key advocacy groups behind. The

00:47:42.759 --> 00:47:44.795
H. H. P. program and we are now

00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:45.329
moving into battle health

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:46.797
knowing that another critical

00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:50.534
issue. We did a state of the

00:47:50.601 --> 00:47:52.636
veteran community report. Of

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:57.007
this past year this year's our

00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:58.642
second. Report. To get a clear

00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:00.844
sense of. It which counties are

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:02.746
providing veterans services and

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:04.615
which are not. Most are not

00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:05.249
most are not coordinating count

00:48:05.315 --> 00:48:06.817
of veterans services with

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:07.384
county services and I think

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:10.487
that's a critical. Of people

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:12.589
here that we want to fix. Aside

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:14.691
from the issues that I've

00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:16.760
already mentioned- there's been

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:17.227
a notable absence of

00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:20.530
partnerships between parents

00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:22.532
specific agencies and counties.

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:24.801
There's a lot generally Oct of

00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:25.335
access to better treatment

00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:29.039
courts. And we are now focusing

00:48:29.106 --> 00:48:30.641
on aging veterans aging

00:48:30.707 --> 00:48:31.275
veterans are becoming a larger

00:48:31.341 --> 00:48:32.976
part of the homeless population

00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:36.647
I think we have to look ahead

00:48:36.713 --> 00:48:38.548
to or what services are we need

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:39.016
our take care of that

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:40.984
population so that. They don't

00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:42.552
they don't remain on the

00:48:42.619 --> 00:48:44.554
street- so I would encourage

00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:46.857
everyone to look at our website

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:48.592
the California veterans dot org

00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:52.763
that- stated the veteran-

00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:56.500
report is on there. As I

00:48:56.566 --> 00:48:57.134
mentioned that to nearly every

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.136
day of. Our everyday several

00:48:59.202 --> 00:49:00.737
veterans are falling into

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:02.806
homeless is- nearly every day

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:04.708
veterans are dying street I

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.643
think it's critical that we

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:07.210
address this problem in an

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:10.647
aggressive way- both are. All

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:12.816
the better and- this specific

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:14.484
parts of funding county funding

00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:15.118
state funding we all have to

00:49:15.185 --> 00:49:16.920
advocate together to. Bring the

00:49:16.987 --> 00:49:21.158
services difference to prevent

00:49:21.224 --> 00:49:21.625
them from remaining in

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:28.932
homelessness thank you. Thank

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.934
you for the opportunity here

00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:35.372
today- let this one up I want

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:38.575
to thank the veterans who were.

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.744
By their- their testing isn't.

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:41.278
The only woman cursed said

00:49:41.345 --> 00:49:44.815
their their store. See you can

00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:46.950
conversation of how it doesn't

00:49:47.017 --> 00:49:47.584
immediately leading though many

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:48.485
other things Steve just

00:49:48.552 --> 00:49:49.086
mentioned which is you know

00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:50.620
employment education physical

00:49:50.687 --> 00:49:52.589
mental health- just it there's

00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:54.925
a there's a holistic process

00:49:54.991 --> 00:49:56.660
here that. Way we at the

00:49:56.727 --> 00:49:58.395
department of Veterans Affairs

00:49:58.462 --> 00:50:00.664
are very aware of and- worked

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:01.298
very closely with our nonprofit

00:50:01.365 --> 00:50:02.799
providers in our county system

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:04.501
our community college system

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:05.068
and various others and if

00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:06.737
there's any encouragement here

00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:08.572
today it seems that some of

00:50:08.638 --> 00:50:10.707
that process did work- some of

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:15.078
the folks family and see they

00:50:15.145 --> 00:50:16.813
found Steve shop. And that

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.414
makes a big difference that

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:18.882
that means they're tied into us

00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:19.516
that means they're tied and the

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:20.016
rest of their community

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:20.717
resources so. That is

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:22.886
encouraging on obviously a lot

00:50:22.953 --> 00:50:26.556
of this is. You know has it has

00:50:26.623 --> 00:50:27.157
historically been a challenge

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:28.692
with the department of defense.

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:29.259
On some of the transition

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:31.161
process people wonder why why

00:50:31.228 --> 00:50:32.963
why is it so difficult for

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:34.831
service members and- everyone

00:50:34.898 --> 00:50:35.465
looks at the type of services

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:36.600
their experiences within the

00:50:36.666 --> 00:50:38.735
service but it's just it's

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:40.404
really fundamental. It's your

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:41.037
leaving an organization at your

00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:42.906
part of your basically moving

00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:46.643
perhaps in in relocating to a

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:47.244
new area. Or coming back to an

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:50.580
area where you've been.

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:51.214
Detached from for some period

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:52.716
of time- with unemployment. Or

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:54.718
within like made like the-

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:56.820
German said today that with

00:50:56.887 --> 00:50:57.421
employment in place but once

00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:58.889
again that's new appointments

00:50:58.955 --> 00:51:00.624
you don't know if that's always

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:01.258
going to work out it's just a

00:51:01.324 --> 00:51:02.893
very. Unstable transitional

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:06.730
period of time. And you know.

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:08.598
It's no surprise that the

00:51:08.665 --> 00:51:10.400
department fences is

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:10.934
underperforming terms of

00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:12.769
getting their- their service

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:13.270
members ready for that

00:51:13.336 --> 00:51:14.704
transition when they- when they

00:51:14.771 --> 00:51:16.973
get out. So here in state we've

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:17.507
obviously taken that our

00:51:17.574 --> 00:51:18.842
responsibility for that very

00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:20.477
seriously with the support of

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:22.646
the legislature and the

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:24.681
governor- we've been able to

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:25.248
put some great programs in

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:26.550
place and one of which-

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:27.083
assembly member when you

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.885
mentioned was cal top program.

00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:31.021
A program we're very proud of

00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:31.655
and now we're on all military

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:32.789
installations within the state

00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:35.058
and providing. On transitional

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:37.060
services to those members who

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:40.630
desire that- it's not mandatory

00:51:40.697 --> 00:51:42.566
we can't make them go- we ask

00:51:42.632 --> 00:51:43.133
all of those that have any

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.868
intentions on standing

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:46.670
California please take part

00:51:46.736 --> 00:51:47.237
because a lot of a- lot of

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:50.841
information for them and they

00:51:50.907 --> 00:51:54.945
level that is very. Locally

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:57.013
specific- connect them with

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:57.614
their local CVS so connects

00:51:57.681 --> 00:51:58.215
them with my out reached out.

00:51:58.281 --> 00:51:58.715
There and all the other

00:51:58.782 --> 00:51:59.349
community resources available.

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:00.584
Our representatives from the

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:01.218
community college system common

00:52:01.284 --> 00:52:02.853
talk about the- local

00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:04.721
educational opportunities- I

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:06.723
have staff come and educate

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:07.257
them on. Their educational

00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:08.792
benefits department consumers

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:10.794
affairs comes in and provide

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:12.496
some information on how to

00:52:12.562 --> 00:52:14.631
avoid predatory practices.

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:16.633
Veterans benefits- but this is

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.969
all it's all one big thing- as

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:20.537
Steve mentioned we recently

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:22.506
Steve does a wonderful job

00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:25.108
with. With Nancy and work with

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:25.775
outside the wire program to get

00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:26.443
that on community colleges here

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.845
Orange County which is a model

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:29.479
that we took in with our prop

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:30.947
sixty three fund- recently

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:32.749
worked with with Steve's

00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:34.818
organization and LA to get that

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:36.620
same program on to the- the

00:52:36.686 --> 00:52:38.421
twenty three community college

00:52:38.488 --> 00:52:40.757
systems. US campuses within the

00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:44.661
LA area. So. Can't stress

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:45.228
enough the prop sixty three

00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:48.598
money that each county. Housing

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:49.199
is available- and better it's

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:50.667
not veterans specific but

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:51.201
better answer one of the

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:52.769
populations and not. That fall

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:53.403
under the usage of that funding

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:55.005
so- it's very important for

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:56.773
every county tap into that in.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.808
And work with the base

00:52:58.875 --> 00:52:59.442
providers to make the most of

00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:02.445
that money within their county

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:03.046
which is obviously supporting

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:06.550
many of these housing programs-

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:08.652
California. We do have the

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:09.119
veterans housing homes

00:53:09.185 --> 00:53:12.489
prevention program. We we've

00:53:12.556 --> 00:53:13.123
we've kind of re look at the

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:14.691
way we look at housing within

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:16.693
our department and- want to

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.662
provide a continuum of care.

00:53:18.728 --> 00:53:20.664
We've just we've- we've always

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:21.197
had a farm and home loan

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:22.999
program is- offers purchasing

00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:26.603
opportunities for folks-

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:27.203
wonderful program incredibly

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:28.972
successful for decades and

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:32.876
decades. However the only folks

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.544
that were ready for that. Take

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:36.613
that step towards their

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.180
California Dreamin own their

00:53:37.247 --> 00:53:38.882
own home could apply on an

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:40.784
obviously as we know a better

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:44.688
answer. Over represented in the

00:53:44.754 --> 00:53:46.823
homes population so clearly we

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:47.424
have some work to do on that

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:50.627
end- and then we always had our

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:52.729
eight homes as well. So we had

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:53.229
some housing options but

00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:55.265
obviously a lot of gaps so with

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.733
the re purposing of some of the

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.902
bond money we had six hundred

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:00.604
million at the time. We were

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:02.339
able to really bridge a lot of

00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:02.939
those gaps anywhere from a

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:04.341
merchant housing through

00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:04.808
transitional to permit

00:54:04.874 --> 00:54:06.977
supportive to affordable on

00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:08.745
then ideally have the option

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:10.647
for ownership there are farming

00:54:10.714 --> 00:54:11.181
home all program and then

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:12.983
obviously later on in life on

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:14.818
being able to reside in one of

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:16.853
our veterans home to try to

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:17.387
create that continuum of

00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:20.423
housing for. The provided by

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.792
the department. Many credibly

00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:24.928
successful thus far- sixty two

00:54:24.995 --> 00:54:26.429
projects have been awarded the

00:54:26.496 --> 00:54:28.798
first four rounds about three

00:54:28.865 --> 00:54:30.467
hundred and nine million of

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:31.067
that six hundred million have

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:32.969
gone out- interestingly enough

00:54:33.036 --> 00:54:34.537
the first project the came

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:35.171
online was right here in Orange

00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:36.706
County was potter's leading. It

00:54:36.773 --> 00:54:40.610
was a program that was- created

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:42.679
a put on very rapidly because

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:44.447
they you- shipping containers

00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:46.750
to reform and to build the

00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:52.589
units- so very very good.

00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:53.223
Program it's been often running

00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:56.693
for a couple years now. So that

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.293
that's moving along well as I

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:57.861
said much of that is it's a

00:54:57.927 --> 00:55:00.563
long. Some of it's got 25% of

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.432
those units are affordable at

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:04.567
the twenty four units. Online

00:55:04.634 --> 00:55:05.168
to the sixty two programs are

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:08.571
without 25% being affordable-

00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:12.375
another 25% Being permits

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:14.911
supportive- I don't remember

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:15.512
the exact numbers on some of

00:55:15.578 --> 00:55:16.846
the others but those are two of

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:18.648
the big the big areas only one

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:20.817
thing to note on Steve mentions

00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:22.919
a bit too is only 15% of those

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:23.520
units as far have been for.

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:26.623
Families on. When you look at

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.692
better ends in the units

00:55:28.758 --> 00:55:30.627
available particularly females

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:32.595
with children- our numbers are.

00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:34.931
It's hard to grasp of this but

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:36.933
our number Chau there's less

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:37.434
than five hundred units

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.668
statewide available at the

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:44.808
moment or- for women with

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:45.408
children men with children for

00:55:45.475 --> 00:55:48.645
that matter. There's a lot lot

00:55:48.712 --> 00:55:49.279
of challenges around serving a

00:55:49.345 --> 00:55:50.714
population- là security issues

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:51.281
that I think were mentioned

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:54.684
here today- in a for a variety

00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:55.285
other issues around some of

00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:56.820
the- some the additional

00:55:56.886 --> 00:55:58.588
barriers that folks might have.

00:55:58.655 --> 00:56:00.457
On the take a little more

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:01.124
cultural competency in order to

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:03.059
serve that population and make

00:56:03.126 --> 00:56:04.761
it a little tougher which I

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:06.796
think maybe. Why they are under

00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:07.297
represented in what's of

00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:10.600
available to them. But moving

00:56:10.667 --> 00:56:11.267
forward that certainly a target

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:14.637
of ours the- funds had been

00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:16.473
distributed I think early on

00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:19.008
LA- as as kind of expected to

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:20.577
the lion's share of a lot of

00:56:20.643 --> 00:56:23.079
the money- but it is balanced

00:56:23.146 --> 00:56:24.647
out. Quite nicely- Orange

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:26.750
County. We I don't think

00:56:26.816 --> 00:56:28.451
there's two projects going on

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:29.018
an Orange County right now

00:56:29.085 --> 00:56:30.820
neither have. The H. H. P.

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:32.689
funding available to them the

00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:34.591
Santa Ana veterans village

00:56:34.657 --> 00:56:35.091
program in the Placentia

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:38.795
veterans- village. And mercy

00:56:38.862 --> 00:56:39.395
housing jamboree housing to

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:42.832
doing those- one one part of

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:44.534
our program we really love it

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:45.034
and I know the Santa Ana

00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:46.603
veterans village I'm not sure I

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:48.705
want to speak for. The forty

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:50.707
but be here to pull century.

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:51.274
But one thing about the PhD

00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:52.709
program is really unique. But I

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:54.878
think it's can change the way

00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:55.512
the state is looking at housing

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:58.581
overall. Is that it require

00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:00.984
this element of words or with-

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:02.819
on. Working with groups like

00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:08.625
caps so which caps. So was. Was

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:13.396
at the front of five.

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:13.963
Redirecting that six hundred

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.931
million towards this purpose-

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:16.666
they advocated very hard

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:17.267
initially to have that would

00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:18.635
support services would be

00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:19.135
required as part of the

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:20.537
agreement for the development.

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:22.605
Developer gets the grant until

00:57:22.672 --> 00:57:23.106
they have a supportive

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:23.740
services- package approved by

00:57:23.807 --> 00:57:24.874

00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:26.876
excited about because clearly

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:29.112
as we mentioned that as I

00:57:29.179 --> 00:57:30.980
started off today there's a

00:57:31.047 --> 00:57:31.514
there's a variety of other

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:34.484
issues that go along with. With

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:35.084

still as well for the state and

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:12.889
if we could get something that

00:58:12.956 --> 00:58:13.456
every community college we

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:15.291

with John bang who was with you

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:32.775
on that part too so. I

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:33.376
appreciate everything you've

00:58:33.443 --> 00:58:36.412
done I do you explain that

00:58:36.479 --> 00:58:36.980
program just what that is

00:58:37.046 --> 00:58:40.783
exactly so yeah sure so we have

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:42.652
at Irvine valley college we

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:43.186
have the veteran resource

00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:44.587
center there and we consider it

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:45.088
kind of a best practice

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:46.990
resource center because we're

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:48.558
an overall complete stop so

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:50.693
every type of service that we

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.929
have in this state or any

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:54.597
institution we offer right

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:55.131
there we have certified

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:56.900
Fishel's be able perhaps in

00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:58.701
there we have disability

00:58:58.768 --> 00:59:00.570
certification we have and

00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:01.170
everything's on site it's not

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:02.805
like there we have to resource

00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:04.641
them out we have- through U. S.

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:06.776
about bats outside where we

00:59:06.843 --> 00:59:08.878
have four days a week of mental

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:10.480
health- provisions for. Our

00:59:10.546 --> 00:59:12.448
veterans specific so they're

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:13.016
actually train from the be a

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:15.018
when they come in and work with

00:59:15.084 --> 00:59:16.719
our veterans so they're used to

00:59:16.786 --> 00:59:18.554
working with combat- military

00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:20.890
sexual assault the main issue

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:21.524
suicide ideation those type of

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:24.761
things- we offer all types of

00:59:24.827 --> 00:59:28.398
emergency finds we aye right

00:59:28.464 --> 00:59:32.635
consistent grant so that we can

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:33.269
provide a lot more services we

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:40.643
anything. To do with them we

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:46.549
provide. Money. One stop and

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:47.183
that's what kind of makes this

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:47.750
a little bit different than

00:59:47.817 --> 00:59:48.318
most of the other veterans

00:59:48.384 --> 00:59:48.918
throughout the state which is

00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:49.452
nice- my background is.

00:59:49.519 --> 00:59:50.119
Military it's nursing so I look

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:50.720
at it more of a holistic view

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:51.321
that kind of brings a little

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:51.888
bit more medical and mental

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:52.555
health to it. Which I think

00:59:52.622 --> 00:59:54.657
promotes that wellness part of

00:59:54.724 --> 00:59:56.426
it too so I think that helps-

00:59:56.492 --> 00:59:57.026
and I'm a date a nerd too so

00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:58.895
just real briefly I want to

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:00.630
give you some of the data. In

01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:02.432
Orange County we have over

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:03.032
twelve thousand veterans that

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.434
attend the nine community

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.402
colleges. Throughout the state

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:07.003
we have over ninety thousand

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.738
that attend the hundred and

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:10.573
fourteen community college. A

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.508
recently we have an innovation

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:13.142
grant that we went out and did

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:16.312
a study. And we look at what's

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:18.781
going on in these hundred

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:19.415
fourteen community colleges out

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:20.550
of that we were able to access

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:22.685
a hundred and six because- the

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:23.353
other eight did not really have

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:24.721
services on their campus for

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:26.723
veterans. When we went out

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:28.725
there we hired our P. group to

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.793
come out big evaluation for

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.461
they did focus groups they did.

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:32.862
A small groups of veterans they

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:34.831
talked with we did tons of

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:36.566
surveys we did over fifteen

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:37.166
hundred surveys with veterans

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:38.935
so we got a pretty good.

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:40.570
Glimpse of what we're looking

01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:42.739
at. We do specifically talk

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:43.339
about housing because there's

01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:44.741
so many application- issue we

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.476
had a look at. But in the

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:50.813
snapshot. They did. Talk about

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.347
living arrangements living

01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:56.486
arrangements with other. 79% of

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:57.120
our veterans live with others-

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:57.720
alone with nineteen percent.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:58.788
And then homeless was 3% and

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:00.690
that's what we got out of only

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:02.825
those fifteen hundred. There

01:01:02.892 --> 01:01:04.527
are those still sleeping in

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:05.128
their cars commuting back and

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:06.896
forth and going from there that

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:07.430
we don't usually find out

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:08.898
about. Until somebody speaks up

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:10.666
and says that which then we

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:12.802
can. Enact our services and go

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.704
from there. I think that we

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:16.472
have a lot of. Resources

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:18.541
recently through this

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:19.108
innovation grant we held. A

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.743
conference at Irvine valley

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.879
college and we had a- two

01:01:22.945 --> 01:01:23.379
hundred attendees from

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:24.580
community colleges. Some for

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:26.983
four years what we did was put

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.484
together had my step put

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:30.686
together a binder. And I think

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:31.254
this binder something that

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.855
we've got to get out a lot more

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:34.590
because people need the

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:36.793
resources they need the

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.394
templates they need the

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:38.995
information. I used Calvet to

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.763
put together some information.

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:42.665
L. A. homeless. Indeed our

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:44.434
groups that provide housing

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.536
there. So throughout here we

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:47.170
have all this hopefully we keep

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:48.604
adding to this. We have intake

01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:50.773
forms with certified official

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.340
information counselors. But

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:52.775
inside the- other part is

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:54.777
information about how to access

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:56.913
food. There Calvet brash how to

01:01:56.979 --> 01:02:00.616
get on food pantries. Because a

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:01.184
lot of people don't look at

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.086
those things they don't know

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:06.522
how to get to a- it. Also

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:07.056
through a complete list of

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:12.695
housing. At any other Calvet

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:13.296
office in LA put this together

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:14.730
and then I have- been dials put

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:15.298
it together for us in the

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:16.933
Orange County office of these

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:17.467
are. Available housing for

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:18.601
veterans that they can apply to

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:19.202
and hopefully get into. Some

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:20.770
are a little bit difficult

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:21.404
because they do require vast

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:22.905
vouchers the bash doctor system

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:24.440
I think needs a little over

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:26.642
hall here- I think we need. A

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:28.744
lot more easier access to those

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:30.546
vouchers but also we need a lot

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:32.582
more outside apartment owners

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:34.550
willing to accept those

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:35.151
vouchers and- follow up with

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:38.521
that- it. This goes over a lot

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.756
of great resources. I talked

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:42.892
about what we need their- part

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:44.660
of the emergency. Grants that

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:46.896
we hand out our to put down

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.865
their first month payment. It's

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.633
to pay for utilities that they

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.602
can't pay for that they can

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:55.204
afford we offer on any type of

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:55.805
clothing that type of things

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:56.806
and it comes out of all these

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:59.142
grants that we actually bright.

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.676
Eyed and provide for them. You

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:02.845
would be surprised at you were

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:04.847
Christopher talk he has three

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:06.849
children and his wife. His

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:08.518
bills every month there were

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:09.085
six thousand dollars him as

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:10.586
wife together bring in six

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:11.220
thousand dollars he was working

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:12.655
in the evenings. And on. To

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:16.692
trying to. Get some more funds

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:17.260
their history three little

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:18.861
babies which baby sitting alone

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:20.663
in orange. If you've ever

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.565
looked up that cost it ranges

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.967
anywhere from twelve hundred to

01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:25.568
eighteen hundred dollars. And

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:26.435
that's only for one child. So

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:28.337
we put all of these type of-

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:32.475
beer years that they're trying

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:38.814
to. Navigate through any. Makes

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:39.382
it very difficult to school

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:48.891
could be. Done. I'm a calling

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.893
Danny that's on his real name

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.595
but it we're gonna calling the

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:53.229
need for today. He's come on

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:56.432
and off to our- college he

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:57.033
takes music classes he takes

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.901
different classes he's in his

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:00.736
early sixties he's- probably

01:04:00.803 --> 01:04:02.872
the most sweetest manual ever

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:04.507
meet he was a boxer in the

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:05.141
army. So we actually went to

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:06.943
the Olympic Olympics and box.

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:09.045
So needless to say when he he

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:11.113
never saw combat but when he

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.715
got out he still had that type

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.817
of- problem with mental

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:16.886
stability. Because of the

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:17.353
boxing because of his

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.754
background there so he has a

01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:20.690
lot of trauma to the brain

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:23.025
there- pretty much similar to a

01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:24.660
ninety D. when you look at

01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:25.261
that. The concussions and all

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:26.829
the things that happened with

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:28.364
boxers he's been very unstable

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:30.666
with his living. He was housed

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:32.602
with a church an Orange County

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:33.202
and they let him live in this

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:34.837
back room for years well. Last

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.973
year they sold the church. So

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.708
they displace but the pastor

01:04:38.774 --> 01:04:40.910
bought him a ban. And he's and

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:42.578
he's obsessed with computers he

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:44.547
always says he owns six

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:46.582
companies in he's doing all

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:47.149
these computer things will

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:47.783
counter intelligence and he's

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:50.753
just. A kick to listen to but a

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.588
great man but he- became just

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:54.490
place but these pastor bottom

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:55.091
advance we've been living in

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.959
his band we had not seen him

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:58.561
since last June. He walked into

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:00.696
our center. Just the last few

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:02.665
weeks and- it will be

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.567
unbearable. How he had not

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:06.836
changed his clothes he had this

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:08.904
huge long beard. But it was

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:10.539
still anyways the happiest man

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:11.107
in the world and he said he

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:12.908
starting all these wonderful

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:14.644
companies again and he's doing

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:16.512
all these things that. Not once

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:17.113
have my veterans ever ever

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:19.148
degraded him and Brough to him.

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:22.685
At any point they offering free

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:23.286
food the offering everything

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:24.854
that they can that's one of our

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.689
veterans. Are resource center

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.624
offers is we have a

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:30.626
refrigerator with food that we

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:31.193
partner with Orange County.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.430
Rescue mission we Starbucks.

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:36.532
Tax and sandwiches in there so

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:37.166
they would give him sandwiches

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:38.701
more and make sure he could eat

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:44.907
into all. These things. Well

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:45.508
one day I went in there and I

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:51.080
said. What is going on here

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:51.681
does not smell clean in here.

01:05:51.747 --> 01:05:53.182
And they said well you know we

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:54.617
have this problem he's coming

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:55.251
in he's not beating and I said

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:56.752
then we got. Take care about.

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:58.954
So I said my new director

01:05:59.021 --> 01:05:59.588
maillot and I said. All of the

01:05:59.655 --> 01:06:00.756
guys said go to target you buy

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.925
anything he needs I want new

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:03.526
clothes and you know I'm sure

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:04.894
sucks whatever he needs to get

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.528
it for my in getting. All these

01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:06.929
things and get him done well.

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.998
Malik took a step further so.

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:10.566
He asked me of any when's the

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:12.601
last time he had baited and- he

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:13.235
said not for awhile. So we took

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:16.672
him to the gym he watched what

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:17.273
clothes he had. And gave them

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.741
all these new clothes. And in

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:22.645
the shower. This is kind of a

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:23.212
tear jerker in the shower he

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:24.880
ask Danny. When's the last time

01:06:24.947 --> 01:06:25.448
you Bates and he said three

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:28.617
months ago. And he had the

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:29.218
scrubber thing maillot did any

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:31.020
scrap demi said Nancy there was

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:32.521
brown water coming down the

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:33.089
shower and he said it just

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:34.924
broke my heart. So they shave

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:37.426
them and got him all cleaned up

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:38.060
and they brought him back and-

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:40.663
he's there now every Monday to

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.598
get a shower with mall any good

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:43.199
to the GM and make sure it is

01:06:43.265 --> 01:06:45.101
clean and we washes clothes in

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.635
the gym. He still lives in his

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:48.604
van I can't get him house so we

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.940
got him social security about a

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:51.507
year ago because he doesn't

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:52.975
qualify or any type of be a

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:54.810
money he is a hundred dollars a

01:06:54.877 --> 01:06:55.411
month that's not enough to

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:58.481
really house himself. We've got

01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:00.549
to do better than that. This

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:02.885
man deserves better he's the

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:03.486
nicest man in the world but I

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:06.389
can't find in housing I can't

01:07:06.455 --> 01:07:08.591
get him anywhere so along those

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:10.493
lines I want you to keep

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:11.160
thinking of Mel but I've got to

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:14.697
ask for you. So my number one

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:16.465
ask is that we do find

01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:16.966
transitional housing for

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:18.734
veterans you heard our veterans

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:20.536
up you're speaking about that.

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:22.738
They don't get their funds for

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:24.673
the first few months when they

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.542
come to us in the application

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:27.042
they they apply for the

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:28.878
education benefits they have to

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:30.880
wait out its it again you were

01:07:30.946 --> 01:07:32.715
Brian state it came to December

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:34.817
he started classes in August.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.585
That's too long to wait and

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:38.487
most of them they don't keep

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:40.623
their finances really well to

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:44.560
where he was lucky. At seven

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:45.127
thousand dollars in the bank

01:07:45.194 --> 01:07:48.631
most don't have that. We need

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:50.733
to be able to career test. Our

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.367
veterans before they even leave

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:52.568
the base and find out where

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:53.202
they want to go. I had a young

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:54.737
man the other day. That has

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:55.404
been he signed up for all these

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:56.906
computer classes. And he called

01:07:56.972 --> 01:07:58.874
me in and actually he was an

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:00.743
attending class. And I called

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.611
him and I said so what's going

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:03.279
on because he's teacher sent me

01:08:03.345 --> 01:08:05.147
an email and said that. He

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:06.882
Robert in email said he had

01:08:06.949 --> 01:08:08.551
suicidal thoughts opinion at

01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:09.051
all. So I called them

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:10.953
personally and I said what's

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.521
going on I said I need to talk

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:14.557
to you now and I asked him

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:15.157
those important questions in.

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:18.894
And got his information. But he

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:19.495
said to me I don't want to be

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:20.529
in those classes and I said.

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:21.163
What do you want to do and he

01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:22.998
said. I I've I've tried to look

01:08:23.065 --> 01:08:27.002
into barber school. Will lo and

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:27.603
behold the GI bill will cover

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:30.873
barbers. So he in boulder

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:31.474
barber school we transferred

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:32.875
over is benefits he's now in

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:33.409
those classes becoming a

01:08:33.476 --> 01:08:34.810
barber. But we've got a career

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:35.377
test that could have been

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.779
easily settled when he came

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.747
out. We've also got to have a

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.783
lot more. In turn programs-

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.751
maybe even to find out what

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.820
they want. And increase our

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:46.822
certificated programs. Because

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:48.757
they are coming out and I say

01:08:48.824 --> 01:08:50.860
this all the time. With

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:52.728
experience. Plumbing electrical

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.964
activity. Diesel mechanics they

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:57.066
need to be able to get into

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:58.767
these union programs get their

01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:01.036
certificate of completion maybe

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:01.570
knock off a couple years

01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:02.838
because of their experience and

01:09:02.905 --> 01:09:06.809
get important. Maybe some are

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:08.477
not going to come to college we

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.713
hope they do but they may not

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:12.615
want to but we gotta get amend

01:09:12.681 --> 01:09:14.583
ploy that's really vital. And

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:16.652
the last thing that I want

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.787
really really focus on and I

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:20.589
think I don't care across the

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:22.691
board we have to treat for

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:23.292
mental health regardless if

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:26.529
they ask for it. When they are

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:27.196
coming out of the military when

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:28.831
they're entering the colleges

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:30.699
every student should go through

01:09:30.766 --> 01:09:32.401
a mental health not only

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:32.968
assessment but you know what

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:34.970
we're just going to treat you

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:35.571
anyways we're gonna give you

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:38.507
tools and skills on everyday

01:09:38.574 --> 01:09:40.809
life situations that we can get

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:41.443
you through. And I will tell

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:42.878
you right now there's not one

01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:44.480
person on this planet that

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:45.014
could not benefit from a

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.949
program like that because life

01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:48.984
is hard and it doesn't matter

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.586
if you're in the military not

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:52.421
you at that on top of it. It

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:54.723
makes it even more difficult so

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:56.559
why not just treat we've got to

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:58.427
take a more holistic approach

01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:00.663
on how we help our veterans

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:01.230
that's what we are doing it

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:02.431
Irvine valley ninety we're

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:04.733
making great strides in again

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.401
meeting in that date a nerd our

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:07.269
persistence rates have

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:09.338
improved. Immensely we have an

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:12.474
87% persistence rate and 85%

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:14.777
Xin rate are are depressed

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:16.512
rates have decreased immensely

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:18.814
we've started out when I first

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.549
started in this five years ago

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:22.518
and testing in getting our

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:24.486
surveys and data collection in.

01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:26.755
And I do it through research

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:27.289
department so it's pretty.

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:30.559
Solid we started out in the

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:32.962
high like sixty seven to eighty

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:34.997
percent. In an exciting we're

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.732
down 212214% now that makes a

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:38.867
difference because we treat

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:42.905
them regardless if they say it.

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:46.542
And I think that's a by. Our

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.544
hope providers coming out and

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:52.548
they sit in there and just help

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:56.752
focus groups and talking Kobe

01:10:56.819 --> 01:11:02.891
goals. And the right in the-

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:08.897
center and I. Ask that's what

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:09.498
I'd like you to do and try and

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:10.599
see what you can do. You guys

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:13.035
already made great strides- so

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:13.602
I appreciate an anthem thank

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:16.905
you very much for your time.

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:21.043
Thank you and the news Marshall.

calling in your committee to

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:27.650
talk about ending better at

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:30.686
home my name is Marshall I

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:31.253
manage director of the river

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.957
county. Development agency- in

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:35.591
the nineteen years that I've

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:38.861
been in county government work

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:39.395
I can tell you that the

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:40.896
highlight in nineteen years was

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:44.700
getting a phone call. In twenty

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:46.769
sixteen from then hud secretary

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:47.369
young Castiel to let us know

01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:48.804
that our site county was the

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:50.839
first letter county in the

01:11:50.906 --> 01:11:53.042
United States to reach a

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:54.543
functional zero in ending

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:56.979
veteran homelessness so I'm so

01:11:57.046 --> 01:12:01.050
thrilled to be able to share

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:01.650
that. Story with you it's been

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:02.851
a few years. We get to relive

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:03.519
it is just a treat for me thank

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:06.588
you. I'm in twenty. In twenty

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:08.824
thirteen was when the riverside

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:10.459
County Board of supervisors-

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:14.430
initiated a an initiative

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:16.899
called valor and what they did

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:18.834
was. Tell all of the department

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:22.705
heads that they wanted to and

01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:23.205
we must and the veteran

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:26.742
homelessness. During that time

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:28.844
and as part of valor we

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:31.213
established a sub committee to

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.581
address homelessness one to

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:34.616
address unemployment and

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:36.919
another one to address. Poverty

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:40.989
in general. Back in twenty

01:12:41.056 --> 01:12:42.491
thirteen the point in time

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:44.727
count for homeless veterans

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:46.695
riverside county showed that

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:48.764
there are two hundred and

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:49.364
eighty five homeless veterans

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:53.068
living in riverside county at

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:54.603
the time. Little did we know.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:58.674
By a few months later we would

01:12:58.741 --> 01:12:59.174
of our the house about a

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:03.479
thousand of. During the five

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:09.017
year period from. Twenty

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:09.585
thirteen to twenty seventeen

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:10.352
apartments community agencies

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:13.122
and the woman the health system

01:13:13.188 --> 01:13:16.625
work lab Ridley to build a

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:18.861
coordinated system one that.

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:20.863
Really had of a culture that

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:24.566
prioritize rapid registration

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:27.002
our armed housing of all

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:32.574
homeless veterans. In June of

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:33.142
twenty thirteen we held our

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:36.612
first veteran to boot camp and

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:38.680
that was convene to buy a an

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:40.482
organization called community

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:43.152
solutions I do recall on that

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:44.620
you were there for that-

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:46.722
Mister. It was just such a

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:48.991
pleasure to work with you then

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:49.658
and it is a pleasure to be part

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:50.893
of the thing the that you find

01:13:50.959 --> 01:13:54.630
yourself in a few years later.

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:55.230
Now I reflecting back on the

01:13:55.297 --> 01:13:56.598
work that we did I think

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:58.600
there's a few factors are

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:00.869
critical to our success one of

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:02.871
them was leadership. The router

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.973
initiative was created and

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.475
champion by our board of

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:09.144
supervisors that was critical

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:09.645
in getting the community

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:12.581
support and the by and that we-

01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:16.385
be required they also directed

01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:18.587
all of the county departments

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:19.054
to make ending veteran

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.123
homelessness the top priority

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.624
of the work that they were

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.893
establishing. Number two was

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.662
disability the Valar initiative

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:28.630
with highly visible it was a

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:30.566
community campaign which

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:36.605
included the park from. Local

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:37.072
churches and community

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:41.009
residents this week. Number

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:41.543
three we had very strong

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:42.144
community partnerships staff

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:43.745
from multiple agencies work

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:44.279
very closely Allen at on a

01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:46.715
daily basis. To house veterans

01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:47.282
at that time we were holding

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:50.853
weekly. Calls and we literally

01:14:50.919 --> 01:14:52.688
went down the list of every

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:54.756
single veteran that we need in

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:56.592
the pipeline. To find out where

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:59.094
they were in the process so

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.729
that there was a an urgency to

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:04.600
the matter on a daily basis.

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:05.133
Number four one we have a

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.169
vicious cycle. The bachelor

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:10.439
valor housing team set out and

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:11.039
we didn't think we could do

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:12.608
this to reestablish this goal

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:14.877
set out to house one hundred

01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:15.410
veterans in the first one

01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:18.547
Hundred Days of the initiative

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:19.147
and at the end of that one

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:20.916
hundred days they quickly and

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.418
successfully house the hundred

01:15:23.485 --> 01:15:25.754
and forty of them. I can tell

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:30.392
you at the time I in my county

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:30.959
career I was working at the

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.794
Housing Authority is. Actor and

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:34.796
I do recall the passion. The

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:36.632
drive and the excitement in the

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.700
office a each and every time.

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:40.669
One homeless person was house

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:42.671
there was just a celebration

01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:44.706
around the office and it just

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:46.708
made the work. On believable

01:15:46.775 --> 01:15:49.144
and it was something I'll never

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:50.846
forget. If we hadn't set that

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:55.050
large bowl in the first place I

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:55.617
don't think we move we would

01:15:55.684 --> 01:15:56.618
have moved as quickly. Number

01:15:56.685 --> 01:16:00.489
five is housing resources. We

01:16:00.555 --> 01:16:01.123
the housing authority at that

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:02.691
time had secured over six

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:04.660
hundred Vash marchers a hundred

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.895
and fifty two section eight

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:08.463
project based vouchers and

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:10.966
develop two hundred and seventy

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:12.401
five affordable housing units.

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:14.569
All of which were earmarked for

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:16.939
homeless veterans you really

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:18.573
cannot and homeless. Homeless

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.809
veterans. Issues without

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:22.878
housing resources. And then the

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:24.746
last thing I think is a

01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:27.015
developing a by name lest we

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:30.585
developed a community wide list

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:32.788
all homeless veterans and

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:34.790
sought to house each and

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:36.758
everyone of them since then

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:38.827
since the inception of that

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:42.564
initiative we've house one

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:43.198
thousand seven hundred and nine

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:44.666
voucher homeless veterans taxes

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:48.570
yesterday morning and I can

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:49.137
tell you that I couldn't be

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:53.008
part of our team. For having

01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:55.010
accomplished a great feat.

01:16:55.077 --> 01:17:01.149
Thank you. Q. tall for review

01:17:01.216 --> 01:17:03.118
and I know that we have a few

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:04.886
questions here so we'll start

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:10.425
with the spelling are you north.

01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:13.261
Martel and miss Montgomery

01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:13.862
thank you both for being here

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:16.665
both have. Done something

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:17.265
across the state that I think

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:20.736
is recognized as a best

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:21.403
practices as a family member or

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.771
Nguyen side it as something

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:24.873
that we hold out as a model for

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.608
other communities. And I guess

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:30.846
my question is I'm probably I

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:31.446
think I have for you Mister

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:34.549
Boylan is how can we as a state

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:36.551
do a more effective job at

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.754
identifying best practices and

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:40.856
then rolling them out across

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:42.824
the state I think that's nay we

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:44.793
struggle with and just when it

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:46.862
comes to veterans issues but I

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:48.864
think more broadly by. How can

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:50.832
we do better can we take a pro

01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:52.634
they're working so well

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:56.905
riverside working so well at.

01:17:56.972 --> 01:17:57.506
IBC and roll those out of the

01:17:57.572 --> 01:18:02.878
state. Thank you. It's it was

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:05.113
interesting I think early on.

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:08.817
Veterans issue really I mean

01:18:08.884 --> 01:18:09.384
obviously we're so I I've I

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:12.587
working or not. Cisco for many

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:14.856
years. There was this period of

01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:16.691
this law all I'd say eight

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:17.225
ninety Gulf War was over-

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:18.894
Vietnam veterans are still

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.528
primary population of veterans

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:20.429
being served any any supportive

01:18:20.495 --> 01:18:22.931
services. Environments goal for

01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:24.699
veterans that were seen very is

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:27.035
antiseptic in some ways and in

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.970
there aside from the hundreds

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:30.539
of thousands of veterans who it

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:32.641
shop a BA with various

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:34.409
illnesses related their goal

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:35.043
for service that along to be a

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:38.647
side of it is the that part

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:39.247
but- in terms of the community

01:18:39.314 --> 01:18:40.549
the homelessness issue that.

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:41.149
All these things really hadn't

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:45.020
come to the- or for it yet-

01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:46.888
after the post nine eleven

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:48.690
veterans started coming back in

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:50.592
an educational benefits in in

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:52.427
in and I think the whole system

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:54.729
itself was shocked on non

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:56.665
profits the hippest nonprofits

01:18:56.731 --> 01:18:57.299
I mean one to really have their

01:18:57.365 --> 01:18:58.600
fingers on the polls really

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.802
needed to shift the way they

01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:01.403
serve veterans the population

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.004
shifted on them almost

01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:04.673
overnight. On the needs of

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:06.608
veteran shifted rapidly

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:08.477
everything moved- and the

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:09.044
population of those in need

01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:10.879
increased dramatically so at

01:19:10.946 --> 01:19:12.781
the time governor brown with

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:16.785
through executive order- put in

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:17.452
place was called the governor's

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:18.720
entering city council on

01:19:18.787 --> 01:19:20.489
veterans what this did was said

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:21.156
com one. All from all over the

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:22.924
state anyone who's doing

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:24.793
anything related to veterans-

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:28.797
better specific or not- comes

01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:30.765
Sacramento we we're going to

01:19:30.832 --> 01:19:34.736
convene and figure. Out who's

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:35.270
doing what where and we're

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:38.640
gonna make sure Reno's charter.

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:40.509
It's quite an undertaking- in

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:42.410
it was. It was a little hard to

01:19:42.477 --> 01:19:42.978
get our arms around I was on

01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:44.546
the nonprofit side of the world

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:46.815
at that time. On this take

01:19:46.882 --> 01:19:47.349
place was really. Really

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:48.783
excited to see. What what it

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:50.552
did was it introduced me to

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:51.186
Nancy and introduced me that

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:52.721
why new Steve from before but

01:19:52.787 --> 01:19:53.288
it there just be a lot of

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:54.789
people and everybody started

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:56.725
looking around and knowing. You

01:19:56.791 --> 01:19:58.493
know basically when with when

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.629
that mapping of sorts was done.

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:02.998
We knew who was doing what

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:04.499
where and to what level and

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:05.033
what they're in in when we

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:08.470
realized we needed to start.

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:10.705
Drilling down into the gap

01:20:10.772 --> 01:20:12.774
identify the gaps in then the

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.442
service there provided you know

01:20:14.509 --> 01:20:15.010
first of all is establishing

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:18.580
the needs than establishing.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:19.114
The services available and

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:20.715
establishing the gaps. So we

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:22.817
really work through this in a

01:20:22.884 --> 01:20:24.719
very systematic way- when I

01:20:24.786 --> 01:20:26.488
cannot state was a priority

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:28.890
that- then secretary gravity in

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:30.625
doctor Abbas Yanni when he came

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:32.694
in has just hit the ground

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:33.295
running on this and we really

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:36.665
focused on. Organizing the

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:37.299
state in a way in breaking it

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:38.700
down regionally and identifying

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:40.702
those Lee partners within the

01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:42.671
state and making sure they're

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:43.138
connected to the team

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:44.773
originally. And then the all

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:46.708
the service providers within

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:48.743
our cohesive within that

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:50.912
community as well so you have a

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.480
community based system of care

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:54.883
state is aware of an educated

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:55.450
to within every communities

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:56.918
throughout the state. And

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:57.485
that's something that we're

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:58.887
very proud of and we've done

01:20:58.954 --> 01:21:02.591
very systematically that led

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:03.158
right into what cal top is

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:06.962
which is our own California

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.830
transition assistance program.

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:10.665
We identified very early on.

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:12.500
That that was the challenged.

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:13.134
He was center folks off without

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:15.103
a lot of state without a lot of

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:16.571
support they were coming to the

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:18.940
state- and then suddenly find

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:19.407
themselves in need of

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:20.775
something- and Austin and we

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:21.409
where they're at and them not

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:24.446
knowing who to turn to. So

01:21:24.512 --> 01:21:26.548
that's where Calvet really tell

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:28.450
tap really sprung from in using

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:29.050
all of those resources and all

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:30.986
those community partners is

01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:31.519
starting to develop these

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:32.787
relationships. It allowed us to

01:21:32.854 --> 01:21:34.589
understand what funding

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:37.158
challenges there were what

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:37.792
funding was available that was

01:21:37.859 --> 01:21:40.495
being used how could we partner.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:41.096
For funding how can we really

01:21:41.162 --> 01:21:46.668
utilize what we Pat. I mean to

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:47.235
see what happened in LA is

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:48.803
outstanding San Diego was kind

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:50.672
of a give me it it's up is

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:51.306
already kind of. Not giving it

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:52.607
was it's a hard work. But you

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:53.108
have a very culturally

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:54.342
competent area you have

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:56.678
everybody who's involved in

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:57.279
knowledgeable about veterans

01:21:57.345 --> 01:21:57.879
issues to some because they're

01:21:57.946 --> 01:22:00.615
touched in some way. In that

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:01.249
community it's a very military

01:22:01.316 --> 01:22:02.684
rich environment LA LA a

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:05.120
completely different type of

01:22:05.186 --> 01:22:06.788
place on. So it took a lot more

01:22:06.855 --> 01:22:08.890
work in it still takes a lot of

01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:10.859
work. But in California rural

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:12.827
areas for the biggest challenge

01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:13.395
is trying to develop some

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:14.663
system of caring community

01:22:14.729 --> 01:22:15.263
based system of care in rural

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:18.633
areas were very limited. Access

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.535
to on any kind services. Are

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.937
around. So to answer your

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:24.572
question what that's kind of

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:25.173
process our department went

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.775
through to understand in

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:28.777
identified in through this

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:30.512
process like I said. We

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:31.079
identified Nancy how to best

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:34.582
practice of working with Steve.

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:35.150
To get his outside the wire

01:22:35.216 --> 01:22:36.351
program on to the community

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:40.689
college campuses group. Prop

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:41.289
sixty three grant that she got

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:44.726
to the Orange County. Well I

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.861
have my own prop sixty three

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:47.462
money that our department gets

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:48.830
in in the legislature they

01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:50.799
missed. That last year so I had

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:52.734
more to offer. So hearing one

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.502
Nancy done I work with Steve.

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:56.838
And department of Veterans and-

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:57.372
in general long who's in

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:58.773
charge. She I guess it you call

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.809
the CVS so. Little different LA

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:01.309
the called the military

01:23:01.376 --> 01:23:02.577
department of Los Angeles- who

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:03.211
had that up we work with her so

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:04.846
now we have a program. That

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:06.548
we've actually added to it so

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:08.450
we have a mental health

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:09.117
treatment but also now. General

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:10.785
long have staff goes to they

01:23:10.852 --> 01:23:12.654
actually do claims as well so

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:13.288
now we have folks going to the

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:14.956
community colleges throughout

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:16.691
LA. Will do claims assistance

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.593
and mental health. So it's

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.628
those kind of things as we see

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:21.262
them as they go along. We just

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:22.997
work on the fly but now we can

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:24.366
is the state agency be that

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:26.601
nimble. Because we set up the

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:27.235
structure throughout the state

01:23:27.302 --> 01:23:28.870
the we understand who all the

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.939
players are and what roles they

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:32.640
play. Down to the community

01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:34.576
level system of support so.

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:36.978
That's that's the biggest thing

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:42.584
is I mean this. My challenge. I

01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:43.151
think being in the nonprofit

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:46.721
world I. Can see this pretty.

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:47.288
Easily the state has a hard

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:47.856
time in in in many different

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:48.857
apart. Getting the money from

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:50.392
the legislature to the street.

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:52.894
I mean that that's that is the

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:54.462
biggest challenge that you can

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:56.531
develop amazing programs but

01:23:56.598 --> 01:23:57.165
how do you get that money onto

01:23:57.232 --> 01:24:00.568
the street in used effectively-

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:02.570
and I think that something is

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:03.204
department we're very proud of

01:24:03.271 --> 01:24:04.973
and I think we've managed to-

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:05.507
figure out ways to do that

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:08.910
quite effectively. Quick

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:14.682
question. What is the what's

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:17.152
the budget for the program that

01:24:17.218 --> 01:24:17.719
we have at IBC right now. So

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:22.757
there's no. There are users so

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.959
there's no better resource

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:26.828
center in the state has an

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:28.496
actual general fund budget

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:30.665
their college so we my budget

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:32.934
there is probably one of the

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:34.736
biggest budgets because we were

01:24:34.803 --> 01:24:36.738
grant so I have a two million

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:37.305
dollar that's an innovation

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:39.240
grant that we can at a utilized

01:24:39.307 --> 01:24:42.844
for. Different events about

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:44.479
it's included in mental health-

01:24:44.546 --> 01:24:44.946
we're doing a lot of

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:47.048
experimental private type of

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:48.883
thing so we're taking veterans

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:50.718
off campus and we're seeking

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:52.887
how mentally they handle these

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:53.488
things if it if it actually

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:54.989
improves their mental health

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:56.591
status and improve that

01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:58.760
isolation factor of being

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.495
isolated maybe they have no

01:25:00.562 --> 01:25:02.597
support at home or what have

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:03.198
you so we're doing those pre

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:04.966
and post surveys and we're

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:06.568
finding out what's working. On

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:08.703
the other money that we have

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:09.237
coming in I have an Orange

01:25:09.304 --> 01:25:10.472
County community foundation

01:25:10.538 --> 01:25:11.072
grant I also a minute I'll

01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:12.740
service grants from prop sixty

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:16.778
three- and so when he finds

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:18.646
that we have coming in that

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:20.582
makes up my- budget the other

01:25:20.648 --> 01:25:22.584
part we have is- assembly woman

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:24.752
Irwin I advocated for with our

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:33.061
our actual on. Going funding so

01:25:33.127 --> 01:25:36.598
we are now in the state it. And

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:38.500
I'm going finding and how they

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:39.100
base that is the number of

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:40.668
veterans that you certify per

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:41.269
year so we have to send in a

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:42.537
certification from. From be a

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:43.137
once in Chau what we're doing.

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:44.506
The problem with that is that

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:45.139
colleges with a large amount of

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:45.740
veterans that they certify say

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:46.975
San Diego. They get like a

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:47.575
hundred sixty thousand dollars

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:48.877
my college I certify a smaller

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:50.545
amount even though I care for

01:25:50.612 --> 01:25:52.614
eight hundred veterans I don't

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.883
certify that me I sort of a

01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:56.417
little bit over three hundred.

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:58.586
And then during that time they

01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:02.490
give us a time for I only get

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:03.091
forty eight to fifty thousand

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:03.691
dollars so it's not enough to

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:04.592
sustain positions. So for our

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.694
budgets are not. Stable across

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:08.863
the state in any better

01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:11.199
resource center so. There isn't

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:12.734
any really. Okay and one more

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:16.738
question to a suggestion that

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:20.575
we heard from. Our veterans.

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:22.677
And also for me. With concepts

01:26:22.744 --> 01:26:24.512
as- transitional housing with

01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:25.179
your- definition and we usually

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:30.952
years. Where you actually have.

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:35.023
A. Housing while you are making

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:36.925
that transition from military

01:26:36.991 --> 01:26:39.127
to civilian life for a period

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:39.627
of a month or six weeks

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:40.161
whatever what do you think

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:42.931
about that idea. I as polls I

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:43.565
think it's a great idea I don't

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:44.899
control that money and so I

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:46.534
don't want to spend it for

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:48.970
them. But I can certainly could

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:50.772
I I'll certainly have ideas-

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:51.306
but I think there's that

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:54.709
there's something there that

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:56.444
there's something there there.

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:58.846
Because it's a need it's across

01:26:58.913 --> 01:27:01.115
the board in your you know it

01:27:01.182 --> 01:27:04.519
it's- the housing crisis is

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:05.119
isn't not. Veteran thing has a

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:06.788
center proportionally

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:08.856
represented but it's students

01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:10.825
students better in a non

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:12.827
throughout the state at the

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:14.729
same challenge- so that there's

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:16.497
probably a bigger solution hand

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:18.600
as well but at as a deals with

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:19.167
veterans in the use of the

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:21.169
money. That I think fifteen

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:22.403
million dollars on going is

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:24.806
just incredible I mean there

01:27:24.872 --> 01:27:25.340
was a time when there was

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:26.941
actually no support for the

01:27:27.008 --> 01:27:28.576
community college so that was

01:27:28.643 --> 01:27:30.678
a- that was and I mean. And a

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:32.547
significant. List left to say

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:34.549
the least so that there's

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:35.183
probably some things that can

01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:38.419
be done there- and we'd

01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:39.053
certainly be be happy part of

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:44.559
that conversation in. In in.

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:45.159
Throw in our two cents in our

01:27:45.226 --> 01:27:48.830
ideas for certain. Assembly

01:27:48.896 --> 01:27:54.669
member quirk Silva. Again thank

01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:55.269
you to all the panelists and I

01:27:55.336 --> 01:27:56.804
know that I've met some of you

01:27:56.871 --> 01:27:58.940
as I worked in that area a tiny

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:00.475
bit I believe were you doing

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:01.075
the pensions religion Long

01:28:01.142 --> 01:28:02.910
Beach a handful of years ago

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:03.444
and I went out with John

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:04.879
Spangler. At that point and I

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:05.446
was very intrigued by the

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:06.914
village this is but six years

01:28:06.981 --> 01:28:09.017
ago. I believe. Because it had

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:12.887
many of the attributes that

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:14.756
we're talking about from. A

01:28:14.822 --> 01:28:16.724
women in family unit to a

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:19.127
guardian which I've always been

01:28:19.193 --> 01:28:20.828
struck by gardens as that's how

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:22.597
I ended up becoming political

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:24.966
twenty years ago at the school

01:28:25.033 --> 01:28:26.567
I taught at where we started a

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:28.736
community garden and that was

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:30.538
where. Literally the seeds were

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:32.907
planted- and I'm not being

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:34.542
obnoxious there but but

01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:35.076
guardians and people and

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.011
wellness there's a huge amount

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:38.980
of research on that. But it was

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:41.015
not only the transitional house

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:42.984
but that it was the permanent

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:45.053
supportive in if you haven't

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:46.721
been out there right- Chen site

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:49.090
tour because- that has always

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:52.427
kind of stayed in the forefront

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:54.729
but one of the things that I do

01:28:54.796 --> 01:28:56.964
want to ask about is. Because

01:28:57.031 --> 01:29:02.870
the potters. Elige was mention

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:03.438
and I also went out to tour

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:05.239
that. Is that housing not just

01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:06.641
for the veterans community but

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:09.043
every community seniors

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:12.714
millennials all of us. Is

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:15.049
becoming out of reach and I

01:29:15.116 --> 01:29:18.920
know that we get very. Excited

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.988
by new approaches and that was

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:22.724
containers but- Los Angeles and

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:24.959
even here were finding that

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:26.828
some of the affordable housing

01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:29.063
models are becoming more and

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:32.734
more- out of reach even if

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.502
they're affordable so for

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:36.904
example I've heard in Los

01:29:36.971 --> 01:29:38.439
Angeles and I could be wrong

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:40.675
that the four WD could cost

01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:42.710
well over six hundred. Thousand

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:45.413
dollars to build but there are

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.750
models out there that we've

01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:50.685
seen in other places where

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:52.653
there the prefab ideas that

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.455
matter talked to a gentleman

01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:55.056
who works in Los Angeles he

01:29:55.123 --> 01:29:58.526
just went out to Panama last

01:29:58.593 --> 01:29:59.127
week to help set up for their

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:02.730
government I thousand units in

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.499
its a pre fab where it's all

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:05.166
folds and believe it or not if

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:06.901
you see the model it opens it

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:09.170
up it opens up into a two

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:10.671
bedroom with showers. A small

01:30:10.738 --> 01:30:12.707
kitchen the cost to create

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:14.942
that's about twenty three

01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:16.744
thousand dollars now of course

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:17.178
you have to have the

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:18.913
infrastructure and all that to

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:21.082
go but- is there any type of

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:22.917
modeling being done and again

01:30:22.984 --> 01:30:26.554
this is housing and not only

01:30:26.621 --> 01:30:28.656
veterans housing that we could

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:30.758
look at it that could be much

01:30:30.825 --> 01:30:32.760
more economical. They can be

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:34.729
built Shasta- any cheaper not

01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:37.064
because I want people to live

01:30:37.131 --> 01:30:39.333
in cheap homes but because we

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.701
want to get the most mileage

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:47.008
out of the dollar we. AB are

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:47.542
there any of those things

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:52.647
you're looking out. Of. Are

01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:53.247
there are there is a lot of

01:30:53.314 --> 01:30:55.283
experiments out- tiny homes is

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:59.153
one- homes on wheels this is

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.255
another- so we're just getting

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:04.592
everything up there that. Cost.

01:31:04.659 --> 01:31:05.193
Are you aspects long what are

01:31:05.259 --> 01:31:06.861
our partners century housing

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:08.663
and Thomas opera searches are

01:31:08.729 --> 01:31:09.297
looking housing at the west LA

01:31:09.363 --> 01:31:10.832
via campus. Will be developing

01:31:10.898 --> 01:31:15.002
two hundred units of housing.

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:16.504
Over the next five or six years.

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:18.773
Residents struggle district we

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.608
have to renovate what is their

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:23.344
of so the that the- less

01:31:23.411 --> 01:31:27.048
expensive. Housing options are

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:27.682
not available at that point but

01:31:27.748 --> 01:31:28.683
we are also working with

01:31:28.749 --> 01:31:30.451
architects who have done a lot

01:31:30.518 --> 01:31:32.687
of- experiment là research on

01:31:32.753 --> 01:31:33.287
this and they are looking at

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:36.691
modular buildings. These are to

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:37.258
be containers day design a

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:37.825
building such that they can

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:42.530
replicate each apartment. A

01:31:42.597 --> 01:31:43.130
single factory and stack them

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:46.834
up and they put a. They they

01:31:46.901 --> 01:31:48.903
put a- a front on and it

01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:51.005
doesn't look like a much of the

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:51.639
building they're beautiful. So

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:53.007
there's all kinds of things-

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:54.575
being experimented. Is it

01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:55.076
getting it's a matter of

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:58.813
getting land. Counties and

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:01.115
cities have a lot of land metro

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:02.950
has of land- so matter of the

01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:03.484
city's coming up with that

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:08.923
lapses that. Agencies like ours

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.557
on the development agencies can

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:11.092
could put out. And then without

01:32:11.158 --> 01:32:13.160
stepping into murky waters here.

01:32:13.227 --> 01:32:16.464
And this I also when I was Ana

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:17.064
veterans chair myself in at

01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:20.935
that time it will on the

01:32:21.002 --> 01:32:21.502
consultant for the Veterans

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:22.470
Committee John Spangler will

01:32:22.536 --> 01:32:24.839
also took a delegation out to-

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:28.476
the veterans campus on in Los

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:31.112
Angeles. Is that where they had

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:34.949
built a housing. The hospital

01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:36.717
remember the veterans hospital.

01:32:36.784 --> 01:32:39.053
The west of the S. western idea

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.289
yes yeah and there was a big

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:43.224
issue at that time where they

01:32:43.291 --> 01:32:43.791
had built a housing but the

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:46.861
kitchen and all these issues

01:32:46.928 --> 01:32:47.428
around the- government the

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:49.163
state working together. But

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:53.267
there was a huge amount of land

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:56.637
there and- then we drove on to

01:32:56.704 --> 01:32:59.106
this site it was striking he

01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:00.574
not only how much land. But a

01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:02.710
lot of the land was being

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:03.277
leased out to other vectors

01:33:03.344 --> 01:33:04.679
whether it be a theater. Now

01:33:04.745 --> 01:33:06.847
and again the murky water plan

01:33:06.914 --> 01:33:08.849
not trying to. Say let's just

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.751
all uses but on the trail and

01:33:10.818 --> 01:33:15.189
transitional type of housing

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:16.457
and again I know we have

01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:18.559
homeless advocates out there.

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:21.228
But they could we do something

01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:22.830
as simple as and again not

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:25.032
Holden pizza but even getting

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:27.134
some of our- car dealers to

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:31.305
maybe donate motor homes and if

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:32.540
they say you had a fifty of

01:33:32.606 --> 01:33:34.909
those. And that became a

01:33:34.976 --> 01:33:38.813
transitional living chest not-

01:33:38.879 --> 01:33:39.447
I mean you have to separate but

01:33:39.513 --> 01:33:43.417
if you had. Some of the

01:33:43.484 --> 01:33:44.819
military the military returning

01:33:44.885 --> 01:33:47.154
but not homeless. But they need

01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:48.789
to navigate and that you can

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:51.292
have them be on a site like

01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:51.826
that for say one month two

01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:54.595
months three months and then.

01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:55.229
Access other services because I

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:59.033
think get the pyramid sometimes

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.302
we do the reverse which is. We

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:03.704
treat something once it's huge

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:05.673
problems over there. As

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.575
homeless now of all of these

01:34:07.641 --> 01:34:12.680
layers do but if we. For that

01:34:12.747 --> 01:34:13.180
same thing in the school

01:34:13.247 --> 01:34:16.684
system. But. G. into people

01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:18.719
were incarcerated verses the

01:34:18.786 --> 01:34:20.721
preventive Chinese after school

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:21.389
programs at the age of it so we

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:24.792
could have a model on land

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:25.426
whether it's veterans lander

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:27.094
other surplus California land

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:30.731
that we could work with the

01:34:30.798 --> 01:34:33.000
private sector. To do I mean a

01:34:33.067 --> 01:34:34.869
donation of motor homes that

01:34:34.935 --> 01:34:38.773
are nice I'm not talking fifty

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:39.407
thousand dollar motor homes but

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:42.810
moderate they could say here's

01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:44.979
a place you have all this kind

01:34:45.046 --> 01:34:48.716
of a wood stick- hub here. And

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:52.720
there's a time line I. Think

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:53.220
those are some creative

01:34:53.287 --> 01:34:56.924
approaches that. Could in the

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:58.926
short term help but in the long

01:34:58.993 --> 01:35:02.730
term- keep some of the veterans

01:35:02.797 --> 01:35:04.732
getting to the cycle. He like

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:05.332
many because in the end we're

01:35:05.399 --> 01:35:07.368
going to have it have some type

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:08.569
of intervention anyhow- for

01:35:08.636 --> 01:35:11.505
those that don't put that

01:35:11.572 --> 01:35:12.073
intervention were seen them

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:14.675
dying on our streets. So we're

01:35:14.742 --> 01:35:18.579
doing things in Los Angeles- as

01:35:18.646 --> 01:35:19.246
I said we're developing at that

01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:21.015
west of the land. It's a long

01:35:21.082 --> 01:35:23.084
term project- we don't break

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:26.520
ground. On the first billing

01:35:26.587 --> 01:35:27.088
and all next year. But demi

01:35:27.154 --> 01:35:30.558
while. The a is working with

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:32.960
the city and the county to our

01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:33.561
create bridge housing on the

01:35:33.627 --> 01:35:35.096
line I want to create a hundred

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:37.131
beds a bridge housing using one

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:38.933
of those from instructors-

01:35:38.999 --> 01:35:39.533
that's one that there's a new

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.435
director up their doctor

01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:44.371
Stephen Braverman- and he is

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:45.005
suggesting that the put modular

01:35:45.072 --> 01:35:50.878
homes are. On the land. On the

01:35:50.945 --> 01:35:53.013
V. a site on the VA site.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:53.581
There's a there's plenty of

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:54.648
land there okay I'm gonna have

01:35:54.715 --> 01:35:55.249
to do is that correct because

01:35:55.316 --> 01:35:56.684
if you've been. To it it is up

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:59.053
to the campus is a very large

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.288
hand campus right on the-

01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:09.363
edges. Of. Is it Westwood. Yes

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:11.031
my press one to one is so you

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:13.067
had this beautiful campus in on

01:36:13.134 --> 01:36:14.902
the edges you have that trends

01:36:14.969 --> 01:36:16.871
that are dying on the streets

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:17.471
all this grassy rolling hills

01:36:17.538 --> 01:36:19.840
on the VA and to me it's a

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:25.179
crime so. Thank you. I'd might

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:28.749
have answered most of my

01:36:28.816 --> 01:36:30.451
questions just kind of quickly.

01:36:30.518 --> 01:36:32.987
It is sometimes a disconnect

01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:35.222
with timing and Alan so- yeah I

01:36:35.289 --> 01:36:36.657
think it's kind of intriguing

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:37.191
when you talk about doing

01:36:37.258 --> 01:36:38.659
career counseling ahead of time

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:39.160
before they get into the

01:36:39.226 --> 01:36:40.761
community college because the

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:43.130
information you're- the

01:36:43.197 --> 01:36:43.697
opportunities and community

01:36:43.764 --> 01:36:45.099
college by the time. Veterans

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:47.067
here about him off their off in

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:48.869
another direction and

01:36:48.936 --> 01:36:51.539
specifically a job with of the

01:36:51.605 --> 01:36:52.706
trades we have our carpenters

01:36:52.773 --> 01:36:55.142
inventor county are very active

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:58.445
in trying to. Recruit veterans

01:36:58.512 --> 01:37:00.581
but- what we're not going

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:01.115
telling community college

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:03.184
students to apply for that

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:04.985
because they are allegedly

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:06.987
going into debt different

01:37:07.054 --> 01:37:09.123
direction and yet it might be

01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:09.757
exactly the thing that's right

01:37:09.823 --> 01:37:13.260
for them so I so- introducing

01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:13.694
them earlier to the

01:37:13.761 --> 01:37:19.066
opportunities- before they're-

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:22.603
at a community college I think.

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:25.239
An official and maybe that

01:37:25.306 --> 01:37:26.707
through cal tap or or being-

01:37:26.774 --> 01:37:28.976
you know that's on the- the

01:37:29.043 --> 01:37:29.643
bases and then at the same time

01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:32.513
I've also heard from veterans.

01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.748
Hey Nancy veterans that have

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:36.951
come that has. Talk about how

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:37.484
they have this transition

01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:39.420
program the military and yet

01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:40.721
they're not ready to absorb

01:37:40.788 --> 01:37:42.556
most of the information and so

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:44.758
being able to hear all the

01:37:44.825 --> 01:37:46.694
second I maybe that's on the

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.762
campuses would be beneficial

01:37:48.829 --> 01:37:50.965
and so I hope that cal is

01:37:51.031 --> 01:37:54.835
looking now after based place

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:56.537
the programs on the bases that

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:57.171
they- move into. Unity colleges

01:37:57.238 --> 01:38:03.410
also. We are in and that's the

01:38:03.477 --> 01:38:04.011
one of the biggest challenges

01:38:04.078 --> 01:38:06.947
because even. Unfortunate that

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:08.749
the governor's military council

01:38:08.816 --> 01:38:10.918
the post commanders throughout

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:11.418
the state we have been

01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:12.987
incredibly receptive in any

01:38:13.053 --> 01:38:15.556
known and I. Hill this used to

01:38:15.623 --> 01:38:18.959
be a sore spot for me when I

01:38:19.026 --> 01:38:19.560
was in the nonprofit world Sir

01:38:19.627 --> 01:38:22.630
if I said the department of. Is

01:38:22.696 --> 01:38:23.264
doing what they can and they've

01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:24.698
gotten so much better trying to

01:38:24.765 --> 01:38:26.667
you know there's some salsa

01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:27.234
please post they're they're

01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:28.736
doing everything they can it's

01:38:28.802 --> 01:38:30.437
hard. To hard deal there folks

01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:32.740
leaving going back to all every

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:34.608
nook and cranny country. But

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:35.175
then like I said we try to

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:36.810
identify those books that have

01:38:36.877 --> 01:38:40.581
some interest or have no or or

01:38:40.648 --> 01:38:41.048
think they may stay in

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:44.952
California. But I think. Even

01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:45.486
in what they give us is a

01:38:45.552 --> 01:38:46.787
separate day so they have to

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:48.555
week that the gentleman earlier

01:38:48.622 --> 01:38:49.189
talked about. Of which is that

01:38:49.256 --> 01:38:50.824
DLL. Labor federal funded- kind

01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:54.428
of employment crash course

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:56.463
resume writing how to prepare

01:38:56.530 --> 01:38:58.666
for interview type stuff with a

01:38:58.732 --> 01:38:59.300
very small bit from the for the

01:38:59.366 --> 01:39:00.868
federal be a on back. To just

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:02.803
kind of drinking from a fire

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:04.872
hose and- you know it's- the-

01:39:04.938 --> 01:39:07.241
cover everything that they-

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:08.575
support of that flies to. Cheat

01:39:08.642 --> 01:39:09.176
depending on whether your what

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:10.744
your age is how long you been

01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:13.113
and what your- kids all these

01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:13.714
different tack so it's just a

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:15.249
lot a- lot of stuff to take in.

01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:19.186
What we do is they've they've

01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:19.787
afforded us a separate day.

01:39:19.853 --> 01:39:22.723
Where we bring universal art is

01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:24.758
just our date cal. Day I'm- now

01:39:24.825 --> 01:39:27.027
not to bring it. On folks and

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:28.595
they have this opportunity the

01:39:28.662 --> 01:39:29.196
best part of the whole day at

01:39:29.263 --> 01:39:30.998
the end of everything. Is the

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:32.433
media. Like for your area they

01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:34.902
meet then for Orange County

01:39:34.968 --> 01:39:35.569
they meet our local interest in

01:39:35.636 --> 01:39:36.670
network quirk. Who is the

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:38.839
outrage person for that

01:39:38.906 --> 01:39:40.908
community they meet their

01:39:40.974 --> 01:39:41.542
actual county veterans service

01:39:41.608 --> 01:39:44.445
officer for that community. So

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:45.112
it is forget let's pretend they

01:39:45.179 --> 01:39:46.647
don't listen to and hold other

01:39:46.714 --> 01:39:47.247
thing and just say you know I

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:48.949
want to pay attention this once

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:52.453
I get out. They will have. The

01:39:52.519 --> 01:39:53.020
contact information for the

01:39:53.087 --> 01:40:00.494
link who. Links are we require.

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:01.095
Them to know. Everything about

01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:06.667
the community and in. Every

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:07.267
entry point in that system to

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:08.769
be connected to that system so

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:09.269
that. That better and

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:09.903
regardless of what entry point

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:10.871
they pick based on their own

01:40:10.938 --> 01:40:11.505
personal demographics. We will

01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:12.106
be able to communicate with

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:12.773
them. And then also they have

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:13.340
that county veterans service

01:40:13.407 --> 01:40:14.575
officer's name phone number.

01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:16.777
Contact information. And at

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:18.979
that point the one thing that I

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:20.681
can't get federally from all

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:22.816
that. The twenty five thousand

01:40:22.883 --> 01:40:23.384
letters a come back to the

01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:24.718
state every year. From the DOD

01:40:24.785 --> 01:40:26.587
but what I get through this

01:40:26.653 --> 01:40:27.154
process is their personal

01:40:27.221 --> 01:40:30.524
email. So we can connect with

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:32.659
them directly which is. Just

01:40:32.726 --> 01:40:33.227
everything and that is the

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:34.762
biggest challenge with Pat- and

01:40:34.828 --> 01:40:38.599
been able to so yes we do have

01:40:38.665 --> 01:40:40.434
that. Connection so. Even if

01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:41.068
whatever we don't give them at

01:40:41.135 --> 01:40:43.003
that point we can continue to

01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:45.038
connect to the but I agree. In

01:40:45.105 --> 01:40:46.774
into your point apprenticeships

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:48.742
to so when you work with the

01:40:48.809 --> 01:40:49.309
trades the GI bill covers

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:50.744
apprenticeship programs as well

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:52.546
which is an amazing way to use

01:40:52.613 --> 01:40:54.648
your GI- and it goes a lot

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:56.517
further in employers love it

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:59.453
and- their statements still is.

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.621
In use wall in paid so it's

01:41:00.687 --> 01:41:03.190
just a win for everybody. Yeah

01:41:03.257 --> 01:41:04.958
and at that it didn't have to

01:41:05.025 --> 01:41:06.860
be Nancy. Tell them- used to

01:41:06.927 --> 01:41:08.829
qualify you could have

01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:10.597
qualified to go directly to you

01:41:10.664 --> 01:41:12.566
see. Sense and it could not be

01:41:12.633 --> 01:41:14.568
Nancy saying maybe you don't.

01:41:14.635 --> 01:41:19.039
To go the- the four year degree

01:41:19.106 --> 01:41:24.945
route you really. Love to work

01:41:25.012 --> 01:41:26.513
with your hands in the

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:26.980
carpenters have these

01:41:27.047 --> 01:41:27.581
apprenticeship programs there

01:41:27.648 --> 01:41:28.816
so it's- it's really. It's a

01:41:28.882 --> 01:41:30.551
timing issue that that people

01:41:30.617 --> 01:41:31.151
the information at. The time

01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:32.953
that they- that they most need

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.588
at night I. It's a difficult.

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:36.590
It's difficult to get that

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:37.191
correct. But those are the two

01:41:37.257 --> 01:41:42.529
issues that I've. Get out

01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:43.163
community college they can get

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:44.731
the vets can get all their

01:41:44.798 --> 01:41:45.332
information but I have had a

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:46.600
number of people say if

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:49.036
somebody would have just told

01:41:49.102 --> 01:41:49.636
me I could have gone straight

01:41:49.703 --> 01:41:52.840
to. You see a or cal state at

01:41:52.906 --> 01:41:53.474
that that I had the credentials

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:56.910
to do that. We've been trying

01:41:56.977 --> 01:41:58.579
to get with the military

01:41:58.645 --> 01:41:59.179
commanders as much as we can

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:00.948
and go in and kind of go back

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:03.083
as far as we can before they

01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:04.485
get out of it. Is the gentleman

01:42:04.551 --> 01:42:06.453
mentioned today that they gave

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.054
him this course eight months

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.789
prior. The reason behind that

01:42:08.856 --> 01:42:11.158
is they're trying to give a

01:42:11.225 --> 01:42:11.725
year prior actually. In the

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:14.661
reason behind that is. In

01:42:14.728 --> 01:42:15.262
theory. It's call transition

01:42:15.329 --> 01:42:18.599
jeep. Goals and- G. P. S.

01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:20.467
strategies. So what the

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:21.068
military does not wither tap

01:42:21.134 --> 01:42:22.870
program is a year out there's

01:42:22.936 --> 01:42:24.771
they're supposed to take an

01:42:24.838 --> 01:42:26.740
individual. And identified the

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:30.811
path with. That individual

01:42:30.878 --> 01:42:34.581
wants to go down. Whether that.

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:36.483
Cellphone business whether

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:37.084
that's going to school or if

01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:38.685
it's going into a trade the

01:42:38.752 --> 01:42:39.253
military ideal to their new

01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:41.154
track to chat jeep. Transition

01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:42.656
GPS program is supposed to

01:42:42.723 --> 01:42:44.791
identify those three passed. A

01:42:44.858 --> 01:42:46.627
year before they even get out

01:42:46.693 --> 01:42:48.729
then that last year in theory

01:42:48.795 --> 01:42:50.531
they're supposed to work

01:42:50.597 --> 01:42:51.131
towards that passive that's

01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:52.599
when they would go through this

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:53.200
process they would figure out

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:54.635
if they're ready for associates

01:42:54.701 --> 01:42:56.770
for. Communications the issuer

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:58.639
UC system they would figure out

01:42:58.705 --> 01:42:59.239
what trade if they wanted to

01:42:59.306 --> 01:43:00.941
put on trade because back to

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.910
the career testing that's

01:43:02.976 --> 01:43:03.544
ideally when they're supposed

01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:05.045
to be doing that. On whether

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:08.482
that's done how it's done it's

01:43:08.549 --> 01:43:09.116
not mandatory that part of the

01:43:09.182 --> 01:43:10.450
course is not mandatory so we

01:43:10.517 --> 01:43:12.586
have very little. Affect on

01:43:12.653 --> 01:43:14.888
that process- but through our

01:43:14.955 --> 01:43:16.523
relationships with our military

01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:17.057
posture in the state we're

01:43:17.124 --> 01:43:18.792
trying to at least in

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:20.827
California as much as we can-

01:43:20.894 --> 01:43:23.263
reach back. In get involved as

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:25.032
far as we can- is far as dole

01:43:25.098 --> 01:43:28.735
le let us. Assembly and just

01:43:28.802 --> 01:43:30.771
how many non not. The process

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:33.006
is that were talking about are

01:43:33.073 --> 01:43:35.208
not only important for our

01:43:35.275 --> 01:43:35.776
military also our young the

01:43:35.842 --> 01:43:38.812
Dahle milk multi also. An

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:40.480
example on the rear testing.

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:40.981
Ran a bill through the

01:43:41.048 --> 01:43:44.685
Education. Committee exactly on

01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:51.091
going back. Sometime in their

01:43:51.158 --> 01:43:54.628
senior year preferably their.

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:56.863
Last semester to go through the

01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:58.632
career type of processing and

01:43:58.699 --> 01:43:59.232
it didn't have to be Acosta

01:43:59.299 --> 01:44:00.601
could be going online to one.

01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:01.234
And we did not get that through

01:44:01.301 --> 01:44:04.671
the education community. A

01:44:04.738 --> 01:44:05.305
which you would think like why

01:44:05.372 --> 01:44:05.939
would that be it's not because

01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:07.040
we see all too often the same

01:44:07.107 --> 01:44:08.642
thing is that we have the

01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:10.777
students are on track to go to

01:44:10.844 --> 01:44:11.311
the four year maybe even

01:44:11.378 --> 01:44:13.046
they're going to two year but

01:44:13.113 --> 01:44:13.647
they don't know that down the

01:44:13.714 --> 01:44:14.748
street in my district.

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:16.683
Particularly with the

01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:18.819
apprentice ironworkers program

01:44:18.885 --> 01:44:20.621
apama nobody Orange County

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:22.956
knows that but it's a four year

01:44:23.023 --> 01:44:24.758
apprentice program many of the-

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:26.960
those that complete that

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:28.829
program are making well over

01:44:28.895 --> 01:44:30.631
twenty five dollars an hour

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:32.866
working on. At Disneyland at

01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:34.801
the Star Wars build buildings

01:44:34.868 --> 01:44:36.570
are where is basically- we have

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:38.805
the carpenters union and one of

01:44:38.872 --> 01:44:40.974
park- four year apprentice

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:42.776
program and so just even

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:44.544
working with the high schools

01:44:44.611 --> 01:44:46.613
let alone our military to try

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:47.180
to get that information you

01:44:47.247 --> 01:44:48.749
would think that. Shouldn't be

01:44:48.815 --> 01:44:50.784
as complicated but believe me I

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:54.621
almost feel like- just making

01:44:54.688 --> 01:44:55.155
the flyer to show on the

01:44:55.222 --> 01:44:56.490
pathways these are all the-

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:58.492
type of professions that are

01:44:58.558 --> 01:45:00.560
right here within your county

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:01.194
and I think we've talked about

01:45:01.261 --> 01:45:02.696
that before so maybe to between

01:45:02.763 --> 01:45:04.698
this hearing. At us up here and

01:45:04.765 --> 01:45:06.933
all the good ideas we can come

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.169
out with that type of. The you

01:45:09.236 --> 01:45:10.871
know like these are right here

01:45:10.937 --> 01:45:14.641
if you don't have to pay eighty

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:15.108
thousand dollars for a

01:45:15.175 --> 01:45:16.710
certificate when you can get

01:45:16.777 --> 01:45:18.845
paid to be an apprentice. And

01:45:18.912 --> 01:45:21.114
that not only good for a vet.

01:45:21.181 --> 01:45:22.649
But it's good for our young

01:45:22.716 --> 01:45:25.419
adults. Thank you so much thank

01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:28.855
you and I up on this last I

01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:29.456
just have to did you have the

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:31.091
one comment I wanted to say on

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:33.326
that that. Is in line with what

01:45:33.393 --> 01:45:34.695
cancers the state chances are

01:45:34.761 --> 01:45:41.034
guide guided. Pathways and

01:45:41.101 --> 01:45:41.601
you're supposed to be doing

01:45:41.668 --> 01:45:47.074
that. The guiding them. What

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.909
type of assessment that

01:45:48.975 --> 01:45:49.476
completed and where they're

01:45:49.543 --> 01:45:50.877
going there. And one last thing

01:45:50.944 --> 01:45:51.411
I did want to comment you

01:45:51.478 --> 01:45:53.080
brought up the topic that. She

01:45:53.146 --> 01:45:53.613
forgot to mention. Mention

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.881
seniors. A lot of our veterans

01:45:54.948 --> 01:45:56.550
are coming back and finding

01:45:56.616 --> 01:45:57.184
temporary housing by renting a

01:45:57.250 --> 01:45:58.952
room in seniors homes. And that

01:45:59.019 --> 01:46:00.687
is something that is viable in

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:02.823
we should start looking at too

01:46:02.889 --> 01:46:04.458
because it helps. Fifty pulled

01:46:04.524 --> 01:46:06.727
on that one. They can do

01:46:06.793 --> 01:46:08.562
repairs around the house the

01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:10.597
senior feel safe. They can they

01:46:10.664 --> 01:46:11.098
the room it helps them

01:46:11.164 --> 01:46:14.835
financially. And I have one

01:46:14.901 --> 01:46:16.403
senior woman in Irvine area

01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:18.739
she's rents to three veterans

01:46:18.805 --> 01:46:19.306
it charges them six hundred

01:46:19.372 --> 01:46:20.574
dollars a month. That helps her

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.709
because she lives on a very

01:46:22.776 --> 01:46:23.376
small amount of money per month

01:46:23.443 --> 01:46:25.011
their social security is

01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:26.947
extremely small. And she has no

01:46:27.013 --> 01:46:27.547
income but she owns the house

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:29.082
and she does one lose it. So

01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:30.951
that's another Avenue that we

01:46:31.017 --> 01:46:32.786
can actually look at that the

01:46:32.853 --> 01:46:34.921
Bible throughout the state

01:46:34.988 --> 01:46:35.522
because we have such a large

01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:38.525
senior population coming on-

01:46:38.592 --> 01:46:39.059
we're gonna be 40% seniors

01:46:39.126 --> 01:46:41.027
pretty soon here everybody's

01:46:41.094 --> 01:46:42.829
going over sixty. But we can

01:46:42.896 --> 01:46:44.598
actually offer that type of

01:46:44.664 --> 01:46:45.098
housing by betting those

01:46:45.165 --> 01:46:46.833
individuals out. Making sure

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:48.802
that there is some type of

01:46:48.869 --> 01:46:50.704
education prior to going into

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:51.271
that housing for the for the

01:46:51.338 --> 01:46:52.739
veteran student and for the

01:46:52.806 --> 01:46:54.908
senior that is doing that. And

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:56.676
I believe we could start

01:46:56.743 --> 01:46:58.912
excellent program by doing that

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:00.514
too so that's another great

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:04.785
thought we should think up. And

01:47:04.851 --> 01:47:05.318
you are all out of the box

01:47:05.385 --> 01:47:12.826
always. I okay I do real quick

01:47:12.893 --> 01:47:14.761
questions because we do have

01:47:14.828 --> 01:47:15.295
one more panel- for miss

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:18.932
Marshall. You house I think he

01:47:18.999 --> 01:47:20.767
said close to fifteen hundred

01:47:20.834 --> 01:47:21.401
vets what type of housing that

01:47:21.468 --> 01:47:22.969
they go to did they go to

01:47:23.036 --> 01:47:24.905
grandma's house or did they- go

01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:29.042
to the HHT. A developments.

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:30.644
Where did you send them all and

01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:32.879
how's the mall they pretty much

01:47:32.946 --> 01:47:34.915
all of them use start ash not

01:47:34.981 --> 01:47:35.515
yours and they use them to

01:47:35.582 --> 01:47:37.017
rent- privately owned

01:47:37.083 --> 01:47:40.654
apartments and single family

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.288
homes. That was the majority of

01:47:41.354 --> 01:47:44.891
them yes. All right and then

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:46.593
I'm not sure who can answer

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:48.762
this in a really quickly to-

01:47:48.829 --> 01:47:49.229
but is there room for

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:54.634
improvement of VH eighty. Are

01:47:54.701 --> 01:48:00.774
always. Of I'd have to get it

01:48:00.841 --> 01:48:06.580
again. A little while. Change

01:48:06.646 --> 01:48:08.515
that we have requested and I

01:48:08.582 --> 01:48:10.517
think there's regulations X.

01:48:10.584 --> 01:48:12.485
that is to get some of that

01:48:12.552 --> 01:48:14.821
money we now the VGH P. money-

01:48:14.888 --> 01:48:19.092
is- replenishes a bridge loan

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:20.994
that we get we pay interest on

01:48:21.061 --> 01:48:24.431
that bridge loan so save us

01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:24.965
several hundred thousand

01:48:25.031 --> 01:48:25.565
dollars if we can get that of

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:27.000
the change be money up front

01:48:27.067 --> 01:48:28.902
rather than it taking out the

01:48:28.969 --> 01:48:30.537
appraisal that we get okay what

01:48:30.604 --> 01:48:31.071
we may perhaps we can talk

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:32.739
about the rest the changes

01:48:32.806 --> 01:48:37.244

welcome home O. C. program-

01:50:31.524 --> 01:50:32.092
which is the program that we

01:50:32.158 --> 01:50:33.159
were fortunate enough to

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:35.261
receive funding from the state

01:50:35.328 --> 01:50:37.330

see based feedback. On the

01:50:54.914 --> 01:50:57.450
three how are three four

01:50:57.517 --> 01:50:58.918
happened a thirties he. But the

01:50:58.985 --> 01:51:03.089
difference is that people had

01:51:03.156 --> 01:51:04.991
when they were. What's this

01:51:05.058 --> 01:51:07.127

01:51:55.175 --> 01:51:56.709
stabilized. We have some

01:51:56.776 --> 01:51:58.945
additional benefits to that- so

01:51:59.012 --> 01:52:01.214
we have our staff on hand to

01:52:01.281 --> 01:52:03.083

welcome home OC program

01:55:46.973 --> 01:55:48.741
requirements currently I wanted

01:55:48.808 --> 01:55:49.342
to let you know that are least

01:55:49.409 --> 01:55:50.643
separate from when we receive

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:51.244
an application packet until a

01:55:51.311 --> 01:55:54.747
veteran is housed. Is thirty

01:55:54.814 --> 01:55:55.315
five point eight days until

01:55:55.381 --> 01:55:58.818
they move in. And we currently

01:55:58.885 --> 01:56:01.187
have nine veterans that we're

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:01.821
working with right now to place

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:04.957
into housing. Our next steps

01:56:05.024 --> 01:56:07.160
for us the United Way hiring

01:56:07.226 --> 01:56:09.362
dish stop for awhile. So we can

01:56:09.429 --> 01:56:13.199
skate the only. That number

01:56:13.266 --> 01:56:15.335
caption needs sure get many

01:56:15.401 --> 01:56:19.105
trans post with the. Possible

01:56:19.172 --> 01:56:21.140
also at work the sub

01:56:21.207 --> 01:56:27.113
contracting process process.

01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:29.082
There's no simple Sir this is

01:56:29.148 --> 01:56:33.086
crucial sure. And how. We're

01:56:33.152 --> 01:56:37.423
all or work with. Just one

01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:39.125
process for referrals welcome

01:56:39.192 --> 01:56:44.831
hosted. Pretty up for awhile

01:56:44.897 --> 01:56:48.401
network met met or property in

01:56:48.468 --> 01:56:52.605
our county. Rents and are you

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:53.239
requesting that they can assist

01:56:53.306 --> 01:56:56.576
with this endeavor. I will

01:56:56.642 --> 01:56:57.243
calls there- and there are just

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:58.611
a couple of things as I was

01:56:58.678 --> 01:57:00.413
listening to comments earlier

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.013
that I wanted to be sure to

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.882
address and to just kind of

01:57:02.949 --> 01:57:04.917
bring up to the forefront- one

01:57:04.984 --> 01:57:06.686
of the focus areas for

01:57:06.753 --> 01:57:08.621
questions was just around any

01:57:08.688 --> 01:57:10.590
challenges that there may be.

01:57:10.656 --> 01:57:11.190
So I just wanted to share a

01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:12.825
couple of the challenges that

01:57:12.892 --> 01:57:16.629
we- think we may be facing or

01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:17.230
are currently facing one is

01:57:17.296 --> 01:57:18.898
around veterans with zero

01:57:18.965 --> 01:57:20.967
income and when that comes to

01:57:21.033 --> 01:57:22.769
housing sustainability and the

01:57:22.835 --> 01:57:24.704
collective work a case managers

01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:26.606
and the VA to ensure that

01:57:26.672 --> 01:57:28.608
veterans are getting access to

01:57:28.674 --> 01:57:30.777
any benefits- income is crucial

01:57:30.843 --> 01:57:32.912
for housing stability. As this

01:57:32.979 --> 01:57:36.582
is an area of our system that

01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:37.183
it would be great to have some

01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:40.920
more attention on. Another area

01:57:40.987 --> 01:57:41.554
of challenge- that we seem may

01:57:41.621 --> 01:57:42.922
come in the future is when rent

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:46.559
increases. Are higher than what

01:57:46.626 --> 01:57:47.126
the voucher will allow for

01:57:47.193 --> 01:57:50.530
payment. And so we are looking

01:57:50.596 --> 01:57:51.063
at potentially once those

01:57:51.130 --> 01:57:54.567
twelve month leases- are kind

01:57:54.634 --> 01:57:55.168
of through- through the first

01:57:55.234 --> 01:57:56.502
year and we're looking at

01:57:56.569 --> 01:57:58.571
potential rent increase. We are

01:57:58.638 --> 01:58:00.706
anxious to make sure or to look

01:58:00.773 --> 01:58:03.042
at how there might be possible

01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:04.644
ways to supplement. Perhaps the

01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:06.779
state might be able to provide

01:58:06.846 --> 01:58:07.346
some additional funding to

01:58:07.413 --> 01:58:08.815
supplement that balance. That

01:58:08.881 --> 01:58:10.950
we're not constantly having to

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:14.654
mayor veterans from one unit to

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:15.188
another to meet those rent

01:58:15.254 --> 01:58:16.823
requirements. Another challenge

01:58:16.889 --> 01:58:18.991
that we are concerned about is

01:58:19.058 --> 01:58:20.860
what happens when somebody is

01:58:20.927 --> 01:58:22.595
placed into scattered site

01:58:22.662 --> 01:58:25.064
housing. Whose acuity level is

01:58:25.131 --> 01:58:26.599
actually too high for the

01:58:26.666 --> 01:58:28.701
scattered site model who needs

01:58:28.768 --> 01:58:30.703
to be at a project based

01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:31.304
permanent supportive housing

01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:32.805
units. So this is something

01:58:32.872 --> 01:58:34.941
that we are concerned about- it

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:36.976
will require coordination

01:58:37.043 --> 01:58:38.644
between the VA the housing

01:58:38.711 --> 01:58:40.613
authorities the county the

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:41.247
continuum of care and permanent

01:58:41.314 --> 01:58:42.782
supportive housing providers-

01:58:42.849 --> 01:58:44.984
and just something that we want

01:58:45.051 --> 01:58:46.919
to be mindful of where we can

01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:48.621
collaborate together to ensure

01:58:48.688 --> 01:58:50.456
that veterans receive the level

01:58:50.523 --> 01:58:51.090
of care. That is appropriate to

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:52.692
their needs to keep them

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:54.894
stabilized. And another fought

01:58:54.961 --> 01:58:56.796
just to throw out here- around

01:58:56.863 --> 01:58:58.898
national best practices so many

01:58:58.965 --> 01:59:00.867
of those communities that have

01:59:00.933 --> 01:59:02.468
successfully addressed

01:59:02.535 --> 01:59:03.035
homelessness did so because

01:59:03.102 --> 01:59:04.937
they adopted. The mers

01:59:05.004 --> 01:59:06.672
challenge instances where mers

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:08.941
declare that they are dedicated

01:59:09.008 --> 01:59:10.676
to ending veterans homelessness

01:59:10.743 --> 01:59:12.678
and it's a way to bring

01:59:12.745 --> 01:59:14.747
publicity to the goal and the

01:59:14.814 --> 01:59:15.314
calls of ending veterans

01:59:15.381 --> 01:59:16.749
homelessness and it becomes a

01:59:16.816 --> 01:59:20.553
rally cry for the community-

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:21.120
this is also a great way to

01:59:21.187 --> 01:59:24.624
brief. Mares locally about what

01:59:24.690 --> 01:59:28.628
is happening around the issue

01:59:28.694 --> 01:59:29.262
of Veterans homelessness and so

01:59:29.328 --> 01:59:30.563
just wanted to bring that. Xin

01:59:30.630 --> 01:59:32.865
in your consideration. Thank

01:59:32.932 --> 01:59:34.901
you. Well thank you and thank

01:59:34.967 --> 01:59:36.736
you for all the as the work in

01:59:36.802 --> 01:59:37.370
your vision and leadership on

01:59:37.436 --> 01:59:37.970
this issue I really do think

01:59:38.037 --> 01:59:39.138
it's such a smart strategy it's

01:59:39.205 --> 01:59:39.672
really exciting to get an

01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:40.873
update on. The way that you're

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:44.744
getting early traction here I

01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:45.378
think what we'll do is we'll

01:59:45.444 --> 01:59:46.979
and we'll hear from our other

01:59:47.046 --> 01:59:48.447
panelists and then add to

01:59:48.514 --> 01:59:50.449
questions with the group so- ms

01:59:50.516 --> 01:59:51.083
Lundy. Thank you for joining us

01:59:51.150 --> 01:59:55.121
again. Hi good morning thank

01:59:55.187 --> 01:59:56.522
you for having me again. I

01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:58.925
think back to the phenomenal

01:59:58.991 --> 02:00:00.726
job at highlighting the work

02:00:00.793 --> 02:00:01.294
that has been going in our

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.728
community about some veteran-

02:00:02.795 --> 02:00:04.830
efforts and quickly housing

02:00:04.897 --> 02:00:06.866
veterans- I'll provide a little

02:00:06.933 --> 02:00:08.601
bit of the background context

02:00:08.668 --> 02:00:10.803
on. What led to all of this

02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:11.437
great momentum and work that is

02:00:11.504 --> 02:00:14.774
being done. At thirty in the

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.475
summer in November and December

02:00:16.542 --> 02:00:17.076
of two thousand eighteen. Of

02:00:17.143 --> 02:00:19.011
the county started having

02:00:19.078 --> 02:00:20.813
conversations the nonprofit and

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:22.882
volunteers of America and the

02:00:22.949 --> 02:00:24.917
VA locally. And to transition

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:26.786
the veteran registry. And to

02:00:26.852 --> 02:00:28.821
the county for oversight. I'm

02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:30.656
we found that this was a in

02:00:30.723 --> 02:00:32.792
line with our- larger role as

02:00:32.858 --> 02:00:34.594
the leader of the pre made

02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:36.629
entry system and the lead- for

02:00:36.696 --> 02:00:38.564
the continuum of care. I'm just

02:00:38.631 --> 02:00:40.533
kind of being able to be a

02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:41.100
competing body for all the

02:00:41.167 --> 02:00:42.735
different veteran and nonprofit

02:00:42.802 --> 02:00:44.837
providers to focus. On veteran

02:00:44.904 --> 02:00:46.739
specifically. I'm step from

02:00:46.806 --> 02:00:49.041
there we have the January point

02:00:49.108 --> 02:00:50.576
intend cam at a loss to. I'm we

02:00:50.643 --> 02:00:52.545
can file the veteran registry

02:00:52.612 --> 02:00:54.680
and really have a good grasp of

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:55.281
what that number look within

02:00:55.348 --> 02:00:58.784
our community- and- ever since

02:00:58.851 --> 02:01:00.653
then- when we released the

02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:02.488
point in time town. At there

02:01:02.555 --> 02:01:04.624
was the director from the board

02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:05.257
of supervisors to come up with

02:01:05.324 --> 02:01:06.592
a strategy to and veteran

02:01:06.659 --> 02:01:08.628
homelessness. And not let to

02:01:08.694 --> 02:01:10.630
marching home to and better

02:01:10.696 --> 02:01:11.263
homes Orange County. What we

02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:13.199
did is we can be in a body of

02:01:13.265 --> 02:01:14.567
Veterans stakeholders thing he

02:01:14.634 --> 02:01:17.103
leaders in our community-

02:01:17.169 --> 02:01:18.704
nonprofit service providers

02:01:18.771 --> 02:01:20.873
United Way veterans service

02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:22.775
providers and although that

02:01:22.842 --> 02:01:24.844
engage with veterans. And to

02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:26.512
come up with a strategy that

02:01:26.579 --> 02:01:27.146
over. That open a dress some of

02:01:27.213 --> 02:01:28.848
the barriers to helping. Them

02:01:28.914 --> 02:01:30.616
immediate actions that we could

02:01:30.683 --> 02:01:32.585
do to connect veterans to

02:01:32.652 --> 02:01:34.754
restart the- heart right and if

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:35.354
I am and we also think goals

02:01:35.421 --> 02:01:36.722
and reducing. The length of

02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:38.624
time it takes for veterans to

02:01:38.691 --> 02:01:42.495
find healthy. At the- exact

02:01:42.561 --> 02:01:43.129
back share with you about being

02:01:43.195 --> 02:01:45.064
able to least up and thirty

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:46.499
five days that's the main thing

02:01:46.565 --> 02:01:50.569
and even some. That we have.

02:01:50.636 --> 02:01:51.203
Greater success stories low we

02:01:51.270 --> 02:02:00.813
have health. Peak of better

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:06.819
with the same day. At. Early

02:02:06.886 --> 02:02:09.288
work. I would be very strategic

02:02:09.355 --> 02:02:09.922
in chipping away at the number

02:02:09.989 --> 02:02:10.589
and making sure that. The

02:02:10.656 --> 02:02:11.223
structure that we built in help

02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:11.624
veterans and their

02:02:11.691 --> 02:02:12.858
homelessness. This is the level

02:02:12.925 --> 02:02:14.694
and will be able to be re

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.829
created for new veterans that

02:02:16.896 --> 02:02:18.564
and her homelessness. Along

02:02:18.631 --> 02:02:20.700
with the marching home strategy

02:02:20.766 --> 02:02:22.902
and the veteran the board of

02:02:22.968 --> 02:02:24.537
supervisors also. Providing

02:02:24.603 --> 02:02:25.171
additional dollars to help with

02:02:25.237 --> 02:02:26.605
healthy navigation I am well

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:28.607
there are some programs that

02:02:28.674 --> 02:02:29.208
provide housing like welcome

02:02:29.275 --> 02:02:29.809
home most seeing their still

02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:30.810
that component of navigating

02:02:30.876 --> 02:02:31.310
the veteran to the VA

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:31.911
appointment to complete their

02:02:31.977 --> 02:02:32.745
application. To than help them

02:02:32.812 --> 02:02:34.914
with the viewing and all the

02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:35.548
steps in between that with the

02:02:35.614 --> 02:02:36.949
gap in our community after the

02:02:37.016 --> 02:02:38.551
board of supervisors under the

02:02:38.617 --> 02:02:40.653
contract for in and- Asian and

02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:42.455
the awful supporting some of

02:02:42.521 --> 02:02:43.089
those veterans that have zero

02:02:43.155 --> 02:02:45.057
income and to help them connect

02:02:45.124 --> 02:02:46.892
to the V. F. so office and make

02:02:46.959 --> 02:02:48.794
sure that they're able to-

02:02:48.861 --> 02:02:50.629
veteran benefits. And also

02:02:50.696 --> 02:02:51.230
finding creative ways to pay

02:02:51.297 --> 02:02:52.665
for rack has some veterans are

02:02:52.732 --> 02:02:56.635
able to manage to pay their

02:02:56.702 --> 02:02:58.804
portion of the rent or managed

02:02:58.871 --> 02:02:59.438
to pay their utility even when

02:02:59.505 --> 02:03:02.374
the half zero in half of the we

02:03:02.441 --> 02:03:06.779
wanted. To provide additional

02:03:06.846 --> 02:03:07.379
avenues for those veterans and

02:03:07.446 --> 02:03:11.117
not. Additional files or

02:03:11.183 --> 02:03:12.518
barriers to their housing. I

02:03:12.585 --> 02:03:13.185
have. The we continue to manage

02:03:13.252 --> 02:03:14.987
veteran registering and we're

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:16.489
starting to do focused events.

02:03:16.555 --> 02:03:17.022
And to make sure that we

02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:18.958
connect the veterans in our

02:03:19.024 --> 02:03:20.392
veteran registry to vouchers.

02:03:20.459 --> 02:03:22.661
So yesterday an honor veterans

02:03:22.728 --> 02:03:26.599
day. We created a connection

02:03:26.665 --> 02:03:27.266
event where we are going to the

02:03:27.333 --> 02:03:28.801
veterans on a registry and

02:03:28.868 --> 02:03:30.603
bottom into the Housing

02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:32.571
Authority office. We have the

02:03:32.638 --> 02:03:33.205
VA we had on the hand housing

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:34.807
authorities that man a housing

02:03:34.874 --> 02:03:36.909
authority. United Way with the

02:03:36.976 --> 02:03:38.911
welcome home and a couple other

02:03:38.978 --> 02:03:40.579
partners. So that people could

02:03:40.646 --> 02:03:42.648
connect to a one stop shop.

02:03:42.715 --> 02:03:44.550
Complete your have Mashable

02:03:44.617 --> 02:03:45.184
Haitian complete your intake

02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:46.752
your briefing packet for the

02:03:46.819 --> 02:03:48.454
hard facts about her with the

02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:49.054
helping authority. And then

02:03:49.121 --> 02:03:50.890
connect to one of the service

02:03:50.956 --> 02:03:52.892
providers to do some additional

02:03:52.958 --> 02:03:54.493
healthy navigation the support

02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:54.927
yeah or complete the

02:03:54.994 --> 02:03:56.829
application for a welcome home.

02:03:56.896 --> 02:04:00.599
And does really. Making sure

02:04:00.666 --> 02:04:02.568
that veterans are able to

02:04:02.635 --> 02:04:03.202
access the resources as easily

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:04.770
as possible I'm- so from

02:04:04.837 --> 02:04:08.541
yesterday's event alone we had

02:04:08.607 --> 02:04:09.141
ten veterans of the voucher.

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:10.910
These were ten veterans that

02:04:10.976 --> 02:04:12.678
had been on the registry the

02:04:12.745 --> 02:04:14.647
longest and high. Very complex

02:04:14.713 --> 02:04:20.820
situations. That need a lot of

02:04:20.886 --> 02:04:26.959
you know. Working three up I'm

02:04:27.026 --> 02:04:28.994
and then at the mention

02:04:29.061 --> 02:04:29.562
previously we have I'm five

02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:30.529
veterans that were house. I

02:04:30.596 --> 02:04:31.197
would say the strategy and plan

02:04:31.263 --> 02:04:32.598
to end veteran homelessness is

02:04:32.665 --> 02:04:33.232
really going to require all of

02:04:33.299 --> 02:04:34.800
our collective effort. In all

02:04:34.867 --> 02:04:36.869
of our collective Ashford. Is

02:04:36.936 --> 02:04:39.004
already making progress right

02:04:39.071 --> 02:04:40.706
would have 15% decrease and

02:04:40.773 --> 02:04:41.273
veteran homeless lessons we

02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:42.408
have that started to arrange

02:04:42.474 --> 02:04:42.942
herself to be a lot more

02:04:43.008 --> 02:04:44.777
intentional in our delivery of

02:04:44.844 --> 02:04:46.745
services and coordinating those

02:04:46.812 --> 02:04:48.714
services at. And we are very

02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:50.716
lucky to have a lot of the key

02:04:50.783 --> 02:04:52.484
partners at the table with- the

02:04:52.551 --> 02:04:54.653
housing authority the veterans

02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:55.321
service office. The health care

02:04:55.387 --> 02:04:57.056
agency with their- see for vets

02:04:57.122 --> 02:04:58.991
program that really target the

02:04:59.058 --> 02:05:02.394
needs of the veterans on the VA

02:05:02.461 --> 02:05:04.630
has been. Very helpful in

02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:06.599
making themselves available and

02:05:06.665 --> 02:05:08.567
events locally we don't have a

02:05:08.634 --> 02:05:09.168
hospitals a lot of that kind

02:05:09.235 --> 02:05:10.703
that the veterans have to

02:05:10.769 --> 02:05:12.605
travel to Long Beach. And to be

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:13.239
able to get their services. But

02:05:13.305 --> 02:05:15.241
they are acceptable for us in a

02:05:15.307 --> 02:05:18.510
way that. Is really hurting

02:05:18.577 --> 02:05:20.579
reducing the barriers- and then

02:05:20.646 --> 02:05:22.715
we're offering very I'm happy

02:05:22.781 --> 02:05:24.783
to have a couple partners that

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:25.317
are helping us with the

02:05:25.384 --> 02:05:26.785
employment component. I am of

02:05:26.852 --> 02:05:28.921
helping veterans it's reached

02:05:28.988 --> 02:05:30.689
first ability including good

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:40.599
well- and Bonta America US.

02:05:40.666 --> 02:05:44.570
Bats were off the partner table.

02:05:44.637 --> 02:05:48.474
And I would also note. That.

02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:50.776
The Santa Ana veteran village

02:05:50.843 --> 02:05:51.310
in the placenta veterans

02:05:51.377 --> 02:05:51.944
village with George will speak

02:05:52.011 --> 02:05:52.711
about- in more detail are gonna

02:05:52.778 --> 02:05:54.647
be opening in twenty twenty and

02:05:54.713 --> 02:05:55.281
this will provide an additional

02:05:55.347 --> 02:05:56.515
hundred and twenty five units-

02:05:56.582 --> 02:05:58.817
it creates a community for

02:05:58.884 --> 02:05:59.451
these veterans to be able to

02:05:59.518 --> 02:06:00.853
succeed and be able to have the

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:02.988
support that they need I'm it

02:06:03.055 --> 02:06:05.124
also creates an opportunity for

02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:06.692
those very for those that are

02:06:06.759 --> 02:06:08.594
that have been unable to search

02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:10.696
for her to look at helping. In

02:06:10.763 --> 02:06:11.297
the private market. And so it

02:06:11.363 --> 02:06:15.267
creates. An Avenue for them to

02:06:15.334 --> 02:06:16.602
be house I'm if they have been

02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:18.871
searching and they haven't been

02:06:18.938 --> 02:06:22.574
able to overcome those barriers.

02:06:22.641 --> 02:06:24.610
I would also note am. Now

02:06:24.677 --> 02:06:25.110
there's other I'm going

02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:26.912
progress and building

02:06:26.979 --> 02:06:28.647
additional affordable housing

02:06:28.714 --> 02:06:29.281
in permanent supportive housing

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:30.783
through the Orange County

02:06:30.849 --> 02:06:32.985
finance trust with the goal of

02:06:33.052 --> 02:06:34.653
building those twenty seven

02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:36.588
hundred units. As we look at

02:06:36.655 --> 02:06:37.156
the resources that we have

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:40.559
available and we do look at all

02:06:40.626 --> 02:06:42.594
the resources are available and

02:06:42.661 --> 02:06:43.228
by extension the scattered five

02:06:43.295 --> 02:06:46.465
model verses the- village model

02:06:46.532 --> 02:06:47.032
is something that will take

02:06:47.099 --> 02:06:48.834
into consideration to make sure

02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:50.736
that we match the back to the

02:06:50.803 --> 02:06:52.571
most appropriate resource. And

02:06:52.638 --> 02:06:54.807
when it's available or trying

02:06:54.873 --> 02:06:55.341
to support them in their

02:06:55.407 --> 02:06:59.211
transition. To whatever works

02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:02.815
for them past. We are very

02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:05.351
excited to continue our work in

02:07:05.417 --> 02:07:06.885
and then veteran homelessness

02:07:06.952 --> 02:07:07.419
we feel that we have the

02:07:07.486 --> 02:07:10.556
adequate resources- in terms of

02:07:10.622 --> 02:07:11.223
vast vouchers at this point we

02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:12.825
have more vouchers than

02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:15.027
veterans. But that's not to say

02:07:15.094 --> 02:07:16.962
that more veterans- cannot use

02:07:17.029 --> 02:07:18.864
them the VA has also been

02:07:18.931 --> 02:07:20.966
working with us aye reducing

02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:22.968
the criteria for how to bash

02:07:23.035 --> 02:07:24.603
words sometimes very stringent

02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:26.739
to mean. I'm chronic

02:07:26.805 --> 02:07:27.339
homelessness they have opened

02:07:27.406 --> 02:07:32.745
it to all homelessness. Level

02:07:32.811 --> 02:07:34.680
for that is a huge. Resource

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:36.949
for our community to make sure

02:07:37.016 --> 02:07:38.751
that we are able to connect

02:07:38.817 --> 02:07:39.351
more people to the- after some

02:07:39.418 --> 02:07:42.554
not like them when you. Well I

02:07:42.621 --> 02:07:43.155
think one thing that's that's

02:07:43.222 --> 02:07:44.623
been really exciting for me to

02:07:44.690 --> 02:07:45.324
see just says. I'm here this is

02:07:45.391 --> 02:07:48.560
such a powerful partnership

02:07:48.627 --> 02:07:49.161
between. Our local government

02:07:49.228 --> 02:07:51.196
and the private sector in our

02:07:51.263 --> 02:07:52.965
non profits coming together to

02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:54.767
solve this issue so it's

02:07:54.833 --> 02:07:56.969
really- it's exciting. On with

02:07:57.036 --> 02:08:00.706

02:08:48.654 --> 02:08:50.856
terms of designing our service

02:08:50.923 --> 02:08:51.490
delivery for almost that's an

02:08:51.557 --> 02:08:53.158
Orange County. Were very

02:08:53.225 --> 02:08:56.829
pleased to be here today- end I

02:08:56.895 --> 02:08:58.897
should mention in already six

02:08:58.964 --> 02:09:00.699
communities where we do our

02:09:00.766 --> 02:09:01.166
annual surveys of our

02:09:01.233 --> 02:09:02.968
residents. We know that we're

02:09:03.035 --> 02:09:05.003
serving between eight hundred

02:09:05.070 --> 02:09:06.805
and one thousand. Veterans in

02:09:06.872 --> 02:09:08.574
our affordable housing

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:11.009
communities. As well already so

02:09:11.076 --> 02:09:12.878
I think that's a an invisible

02:09:12.945 --> 02:09:14.746
part of the veterans programs

02:09:14.813 --> 02:09:16.515
that people take advantage of.

02:09:16.582 --> 02:09:18.784
And I just to make a point

02:09:18.851 --> 02:09:22.621
about- what is needed to end

02:09:22.688 --> 02:09:23.222
homelessness in general which

02:09:23.288 --> 02:09:24.923
includes I would say veterans

02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:25.491
hopelessness is a subset of

02:09:25.557 --> 02:09:28.594
that. Although has a different-

02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:29.194
supportive services dimension

02:09:29.261 --> 02:09:31.029
to it. It is fundamentally

02:09:31.096 --> 02:09:32.731
built on the same principle

02:09:32.798 --> 02:09:36.635
that I we have a housing

02:09:36.702 --> 02:09:42.941
shortage crisis. And so.

02:09:43.008 --> 02:09:50.582
Housing. Action in the creation

02:09:50.649 --> 02:09:51.216
of new units is essential serve

02:09:51.283 --> 02:09:51.850
the entire problem. And to meet

02:09:51.917 --> 02:09:52.851
the challenge and so we are

02:09:52.918 --> 02:09:54.620
very grateful to be- really

02:09:54.686 --> 02:09:55.220
selected by the city of Santa

02:09:55.287 --> 02:09:56.889
Ana- help with funding from the

02:09:56.955 --> 02:09:57.422
county of orange- to- to

02:09:57.489 --> 02:09:58.590
deliver these units so. Santa

02:09:58.657 --> 02:09:59.191
Ana veterans village with the

02:09:59.258 --> 02:10:00.759
largest homeless veterans

02:10:00.826 --> 02:10:02.861
single purpose housing project

02:10:02.928 --> 02:10:06.632
in Orange County- mercy housing

02:10:06.698 --> 02:10:08.901
in Placentia has the Placentia

02:10:08.967 --> 02:10:09.368
veterans village under

02:10:09.434 --> 02:10:12.671
development. We will complete

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:14.473
that project and began lease up

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:15.073
in on February first of next

02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:16.775
year so we're we're coming

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:19.011
right up on it and we're very

02:10:19.077 --> 02:10:20.546
excited about that opportunity.

02:10:20.612 --> 02:10:22.881
In addition in Orange County we

02:10:22.948 --> 02:10:24.650
have another one hundred and

02:10:24.716 --> 02:10:28.587
nine. Veteran housing units

02:10:28.654 --> 02:10:30.522
scattered throughout a variety

02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:31.089
of housing opportunities in

02:10:31.156 --> 02:10:34.893
Orange County so- that's a

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:36.695
hundred and eighty four units

02:10:36.762 --> 02:10:40.799
of our own including the- the

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:41.400
fifty from Placentia veterans

02:10:41.466 --> 02:10:42.401
allege and mercy housing-

02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:44.603
there's a good number of

02:10:44.670 --> 02:10:45.204
housing units coming on to

02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:48.507
target. What we have identified

02:10:48.574 --> 02:10:49.074
in the point in time can all

02:10:49.141 --> 02:10:51.076
echoed the flexibility that the

02:10:51.143 --> 02:10:52.945
VA is providing in terms of

02:10:53.011 --> 02:10:56.481
being flexible on the exact

02:10:56.548 --> 02:10:58.717
definition of homeless- that's

02:10:58.784 --> 02:11:00.552
that are able to be served by

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:02.721
bash vouchers I think that's

02:11:02.788 --> 02:11:06.592
that's a central. Another.

02:11:06.658 --> 02:11:08.760
Invisible population that we

02:11:08.827 --> 02:11:10.562
see not being attended to and a

02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:12.664
growing challenge- which you

02:11:12.731 --> 02:11:14.533
may have heard of is the-

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:16.568
errands who are homeless. And

02:11:16.635 --> 02:11:18.704
have a less than honorable

02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:20.772
discharge that challenge of

02:11:20.839 --> 02:11:22.708
serving that population in I

02:11:22.774 --> 02:11:24.409
think for the best that were

02:11:24.476 --> 02:11:27.312
here earlier the very

02:11:27.379 --> 02:11:27.846
eloquently documented the

02:11:27.913 --> 02:11:30.716
challenges of. That you face

02:11:30.782 --> 02:11:32.951
coming out of combat work

02:11:33.018 --> 02:11:35.020
service did you Asians- being

02:11:35.087 --> 02:11:40.726
that. Process out of military

02:11:40.792 --> 02:11:41.293
service with a less than

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.961
honorable discharge and then

02:11:43.028 --> 02:11:44.663
not being able to be service

02:11:44.730 --> 02:11:46.531
can at all with the VA creates

02:11:46.598 --> 02:11:47.199
enormous challenges in terms of

02:11:47.266 --> 02:11:50.736
being able to use- high housing

02:11:50.802 --> 02:11:52.804
benefits. Are targeted at

02:11:52.871 --> 02:11:54.906
better it so I think that's an

02:11:54.973 --> 02:11:56.642
invisible population. We are

02:11:56.708 --> 02:11:59.044
aware of and we're struggling I

02:11:59.111 --> 02:12:00.479
think going to struggle to

02:12:00.545 --> 02:12:00.979
address in the future so

02:12:01.046 --> 02:12:01.546
hopefully that will become a

02:12:01.613 --> 02:12:04.716
priority. In terms of a senator

02:12:04.783 --> 02:12:09.087
veterans village. Which is only

02:12:09.154 --> 02:12:09.755
the first seventy five units of

02:12:09.821 --> 02:12:12.557
another hundred nine as I

02:12:12.624 --> 02:12:13.091
mentioned that we will be

02:12:13.158 --> 02:12:13.725
bringing online in the next two

02:12:13.792 --> 02:12:16.662
years- what we have learned is

02:12:16.728 --> 02:12:18.864
that what we don't know we can

02:12:18.930 --> 02:12:20.432
be taught by people who have

02:12:20.499 --> 02:12:22.668
experience so steep pack is of

02:12:22.734 --> 02:12:24.569
course one of the renowned

02:12:24.636 --> 02:12:25.103
experts in maybe in the

02:12:25.170 --> 02:12:28.907
country. On on housing homeless

02:12:28.974 --> 02:12:30.409
vets am providing supportive

02:12:30.475 --> 02:12:30.942
services and so where we

02:12:31.009 --> 02:12:34.579
learned a lot from Steve- one

02:12:34.646 --> 02:12:36.548
of his ex colleagues on our

02:12:36.615 --> 02:12:38.750
team the jamboree advising us

02:12:38.817 --> 02:12:40.419
on how we design these program.

02:12:40.485 --> 02:12:42.788
We're hiring bats with bringing

02:12:42.854 --> 02:12:44.556
and- the good will tear any

02:12:44.623 --> 02:12:46.758
center veterans legal institute

02:12:46.825 --> 02:12:47.292
strength and support which

02:12:47.359 --> 02:12:52.798
provides- veterans. Psychiatric

02:12:52.864 --> 02:12:53.332
services and psychological

02:12:53.398 --> 02:12:58.537
services. In two of our

02:12:58.603 --> 02:12:59.104
communities so it's senator

02:12:59.171 --> 02:13:00.739
better is village which I. Hope

02:13:00.806 --> 02:13:01.306
will get invitations to your

02:13:01.373 --> 02:13:01.873
and that you'll be able to

02:13:01.940 --> 02:13:03.075
attend the grand opening and in

02:13:03.141 --> 02:13:04.509
the spring. But one of the

02:13:04.576 --> 02:13:05.077
essential features that we

02:13:05.143 --> 02:13:06.878
realize is that these

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.547
communities do become centers

02:13:08.613 --> 02:13:10.615
of service delivery to the

02:13:10.682 --> 02:13:12.818
veterans community in the

02:13:12.884 --> 02:13:14.586
surrounding neighborhood. So

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:16.521
the state federal local

02:13:16.588 --> 02:13:17.055
governments are investing

02:13:17.122 --> 02:13:18.857
millions of dollars in the

02:13:18.924 --> 02:13:19.424
creation of these physical

02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:22.894
platforms. And what we know is

02:13:22.961 --> 02:13:25.163
that there are veterans need

02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:25.831
the same services that many of

02:13:25.897 --> 02:13:28.433
almost Besser seeking. Who live

02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:29.067
in these communities so what we

02:13:29.134 --> 02:13:32.637
did at Santana is we designed

02:13:32.704 --> 02:13:33.205
five thousand square feet a

02:13:33.271 --> 02:13:34.906
community services space we're

02:13:34.973 --> 02:13:36.575
good will Terni center. The L.

02:13:36.641 --> 02:13:39.778
Y. strength and support the VA

02:13:39.845 --> 02:13:42.781
case management team can all

02:13:42.848 --> 02:13:44.916
have an office. And a public

02:13:44.983 --> 02:13:46.718
service footprint there so that

02:13:46.785 --> 02:13:48.887
they face outward along First

02:13:48.954 --> 02:13:49.554
Street near harbor Boulevard in

02:13:49.621 --> 02:13:50.756
Santa Ana- there is the

02:13:50.822 --> 02:13:52.858
opportunity for people to come

02:13:52.924 --> 02:13:54.993
in and- who need to access

02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:56.795
services from these. Highly

02:13:56.862 --> 02:13:58.764
valuable organizations right

02:13:58.830 --> 02:14:00.632
there in the Santa Ana

02:14:00.699 --> 02:14:01.266
community as opposed to having

02:14:01.333 --> 02:14:02.834
to travel to another

02:14:02.901 --> 02:14:04.603
neighborhood another community.

02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:06.605
So there's a walk in

02:14:06.671 --> 02:14:08.540
opportunity that we find

02:14:08.607 --> 02:14:10.542
extremely valuable and also

02:14:10.609 --> 02:14:11.143
makes it possible for these

02:14:11.209 --> 02:14:12.711
great service for others to

02:14:12.778 --> 02:14:14.646
partner with us. By having a

02:14:14.713 --> 02:14:15.213
physical presence in these

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:17.082
housing developments so it

02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:18.650
makes it a service rich

02:14:18.717 --> 02:14:20.585
environment not only for the

02:14:20.652 --> 02:14:21.186
residents who live there. But

02:14:21.253 --> 02:14:22.788
office also for the surrounding

02:14:22.854 --> 02:14:24.890
community so we're really

02:14:24.956 --> 02:14:26.758
pleased with our partnerships

02:14:26.825 --> 02:14:28.627
and- and hope to- replicate

02:14:28.693 --> 02:14:34.766
that in our. Next single

02:14:34.833 --> 02:14:35.267
purpose debtors housing

02:14:35.333 --> 02:14:42.741
development. I without I'll

02:14:42.808 --> 02:14:43.341
conclude my remarks and just

02:14:43.408 --> 02:14:44.810
say that- we're very proud to

02:14:44.876 --> 02:14:45.377
be an Orange County founded

02:14:45.444 --> 02:14:47.145
based organization that has a

02:14:47.212 --> 02:14:47.779
nonprofit corporation who seeks

02:14:47.846 --> 02:14:48.613
to develop additional housing

02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:49.181
for all sorts of vulnerable

02:14:49.247 --> 02:14:50.782
populations were honored to be

02:14:50.849 --> 02:14:53.151
able to begin to participate in

02:14:53.218 --> 02:14:54.753
this and our partnership with

02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:56.855
the county and the city of

02:14:56.922 --> 02:14:58.723
Santa Ana in particular is. We

02:14:58.790 --> 02:15:00.792
feel very grateful and honored

02:15:00.859 --> 02:15:01.226
and a great deal of

02:15:01.293 --> 02:15:05.063
responsibility to- to do the

02:15:05.130 --> 02:15:08.733
right thing by our debts who

02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:09.301
have come home deserve to be

02:15:09.367 --> 02:15:16.675
careful. Thank you. Thank you.

02:15:16.741 --> 02:15:17.175
To add as that is banks

02:15:17.242 --> 02:15:20.879
mentioned there are there when

02:15:20.946 --> 02:15:21.379
the challenges with the

02:15:21.446 --> 02:15:22.581
scattered site model is that

02:15:22.647 --> 02:15:24.683
there are that's where the ag

02:15:24.749 --> 02:15:28.620
cuties too great for that model

02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:29.254
to work are the services that

02:15:29.321 --> 02:15:30.889
are twenty provided that

02:15:30.956 --> 02:15:32.991
entrants villages. Going to be

02:15:33.058 --> 02:15:33.625
able to serve the needs of that

02:15:33.692 --> 02:15:38.797
population. Yes we're we're

02:15:38.864 --> 02:15:40.765
finding I appreciate. Deputy

02:15:40.832 --> 02:15:41.333
secretary boilers comments

02:15:41.399 --> 02:15:44.436
about the PhD program the

02:15:44.503 --> 02:15:46.838
demand- to insure you know

02:15:46.905 --> 02:15:48.940
using that one mechanism which

02:15:49.007 --> 02:15:50.909
we're not having to use mercy

02:15:50.976 --> 02:15:52.577
housing using a Placentia but

02:15:52.644 --> 02:15:54.779
the standard that was embedded

02:15:54.846 --> 02:15:56.481
in the policy language about

02:15:56.548 --> 02:15:58.750
having a high capacity services

02:15:58.817 --> 02:16:01.152
plan embedded within the

02:16:01.219 --> 02:16:02.621
development strategy and the

02:16:02.687 --> 02:16:06.791
application is essential so yes

02:16:06.858 --> 02:16:08.693
we have clinicians- we find

02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:09.261
about two hundred thousand

02:16:09.327 --> 02:16:10.929
dollars out of our operating

02:16:10.996 --> 02:16:12.497
budget to provide support

02:16:12.564 --> 02:16:15.166
services- with train staff. As

02:16:15.233 --> 02:16:20.372
well as the manage the

02:16:20.438 --> 02:16:20.972
collaborative that deliver all

02:16:21.039 --> 02:16:22.607
the services so we'd be a lot.

02:16:22.674 --> 02:16:26.511
We are both directly delivering.

02:16:26.578 --> 02:16:27.112
To the deaths through our own

02:16:27.178 --> 02:16:28.947
staff as well as collaborating

02:16:29.014 --> 02:16:30.782
with the VA and other

02:16:30.849 --> 02:16:32.884
organizations to serve the most

02:16:32.951 --> 02:16:36.721
high acuity debts that you can

02:16:36.788 --> 02:16:38.690
find on the streets- we're

02:16:38.757 --> 02:16:40.926
we're anticipating that we are

02:16:40.992 --> 02:16:43.061
taking of the people who are

02:16:43.128 --> 02:16:44.963
most challenging to serve in

02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:48.800
our work in what are the

02:16:48.867 --> 02:16:49.401
funding streams that were able

02:16:49.467 --> 02:16:50.936
to tap into. For the for the

02:16:51.002 --> 02:16:54.606
service side. Well what we did

02:16:54.673 --> 02:16:55.173
was we identified what we

02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:56.808
thought was a necessary

02:16:56.875 --> 02:16:58.677
standard based on at vice and

02:16:58.743 --> 02:17:00.912
experiences that both we've had

02:17:00.979 --> 02:17:02.881
an all of our advisors AT so we

02:17:02.948 --> 02:17:06.585
essentially bill the budget-

02:17:06.651 --> 02:17:08.820
before we went looking for-

02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:10.522
underwriting for the entire

02:17:10.589 --> 02:17:12.691
project. So we kept designing

02:17:12.757 --> 02:17:14.593
the underwriting strategy over

02:17:14.659 --> 02:17:15.193
and over again until we were

02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:18.830
able to find the operations of

02:17:18.897 --> 02:17:20.565
the property and we treated the

02:17:20.632 --> 02:17:23.068
services- funds as simply a

02:17:23.134 --> 02:17:25.003
part of the operating costs so

02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:26.905
what did that mean we had to do

02:17:26.972 --> 02:17:28.974
probably about another two to

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:30.909
three million dollars worth of

02:17:30.976 --> 02:17:32.877
capital had to be acquired. So

02:17:32.944 --> 02:17:33.478
that they could we could under

02:17:33.545 --> 02:17:35.013
right. Not quite a quarter

02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:36.615
million dollars of funds for

02:17:36.681 --> 02:17:38.717
support of services every year

02:17:38.783 --> 02:17:40.819
right into the operating budget

02:17:40.885 --> 02:17:42.587
so that included- bonds that

02:17:42.654 --> 02:17:44.489
eight state bonds that included

02:17:44.556 --> 02:17:46.992
9% tax credits. That included-

02:17:47.058 --> 02:17:48.827
pro project based vouchers the

02:17:48.893 --> 02:17:50.595
bash vouchers from the city of

02:17:50.662 --> 02:17:52.864
Savannah- which with which we

02:17:52.931 --> 02:17:54.699
were able to secure additional

02:17:54.766 --> 02:17:56.801
data. So that we could find

02:17:56.868 --> 02:17:58.937
those services so it was

02:17:59.004 --> 02:18:00.505
usually using our traditional

02:18:00.572 --> 02:18:02.974
again we didn't go after the H.

02:18:03.041 --> 02:18:03.541
H. B. which would have been

02:18:03.608 --> 02:18:04.943
another option. But we were

02:18:05.010 --> 02:18:06.511
able to fund those supportive

02:18:06.578 --> 02:18:09.080
services using the traditional

02:18:09.147 --> 02:18:09.614
mechanisms that affordable

02:18:09.681 --> 02:18:10.715
housing projects across the

02:18:10.782 --> 02:18:14.786
state have used for years- it's

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:15.420
just that we took us special

02:18:15.487 --> 02:18:18.590
care to. Outline the

02:18:18.657 --> 02:18:19.157
requirement for the funds up

02:18:19.224 --> 02:18:25.130
front. I just have one more

02:18:25.196 --> 02:18:26.731
question about- Epona hi to the

02:18:26.798 --> 02:18:27.332
full panel which is. So as you

02:18:27.399 --> 02:18:28.733
have been through this journey

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:30.935
now are there opportunities

02:18:31.002 --> 02:18:33.238
where. I as as a local assembly

02:18:33.304 --> 02:18:34.739
member are the roadblocks nay.

02:18:34.806 --> 02:18:36.741
That we can help clear are you

02:18:36.808 --> 02:18:39.010
know ways that we can make it

02:18:39.077 --> 02:18:39.644
easier. To do the work you're

02:18:39.711 --> 02:18:42.647
doing an easier for us to get

02:18:42.714 --> 02:18:43.281
veterans the services that they

02:18:43.348 --> 02:18:52.757
need. Number. That is the

02:18:52.824 --> 02:18:53.358
fantastic question and thank

02:18:53.425 --> 02:18:55.126
you as always for your passion

02:18:55.193 --> 02:18:57.028
for- working to address at

02:18:57.095 --> 02:19:00.398
veterans homeless. I think

02:19:00.465 --> 02:19:02.734
looking at that kind of what I

02:19:02.801 --> 02:19:04.602
referenced earlier around rent

02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:06.771
increases- and as were being

02:19:06.838 --> 02:19:08.907
coming towards the end of those

02:19:08.973 --> 02:19:09.574
initial twelve month leases for

02:19:09.641 --> 02:19:11.076
people who can house. I think

02:19:11.142 --> 02:19:13.411
that is an area that we could

02:19:13.478 --> 02:19:18.483
look into further together. My

02:19:18.550 --> 02:19:19.084
initial thought and then- one

02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:20.919
of the areas that we're looking

02:19:20.985 --> 02:19:22.954
at as well as is the ongoing

02:19:23.021 --> 02:19:23.521
funding stream for support

02:19:23.588 --> 02:19:26.725
services. And so- as George

02:19:26.791 --> 02:19:29.094
mentioned they've been able to

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:29.661
build it into their funding

02:19:29.728 --> 02:19:32.731
strategy for building I'm

02:19:32.797 --> 02:19:33.331
project based housing but for

02:19:33.398 --> 02:19:34.766
this guy right side and to be

02:19:34.833 --> 02:19:37.001
able to provide additional

02:19:37.068 --> 02:19:38.636
support services to what the VA

02:19:38.703 --> 02:19:40.505
can offer- the funding for

02:19:40.572 --> 02:19:42.974
that- were incredibly grateful

02:19:43.041 --> 02:19:43.475
for the funding that we

02:19:43.541 --> 02:19:44.943
receive. We know that there

02:19:45.009 --> 02:19:46.511
will be at a time frame for

02:19:46.578 --> 02:19:48.613
that will and- and so

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:50.815
potentially in our help for

02:19:50.882 --> 02:19:54.652
ongoing funding streams. For

02:19:54.719 --> 02:19:55.253
their support services in the

02:19:55.320 --> 02:20:00.558
scattered site model. Thank you.

02:20:00.625 --> 02:20:02.794
I would say the opportunity to

02:20:02.861 --> 02:20:04.796
look at that veterans that

02:20:04.863 --> 02:20:05.396
towards managed the ones that

02:20:05.463 --> 02:20:06.030
are other than honorable just

02:20:06.097 --> 02:20:06.765
in making sure that there is

02:20:06.831 --> 02:20:07.298
some level of service to

02:20:07.365 --> 02:20:08.800
resources for them is outside

02:20:08.867 --> 02:20:10.902
the traditional model from the

02:20:10.969 --> 02:20:14.539
VA and we are seeing that being

02:20:14.606 --> 02:20:15.140
an increase in our community

02:20:15.206 --> 02:20:16.808
I'm and locally we're fortunate

02:20:16.875 --> 02:20:18.743
that we have to and- continuum

02:20:18.810 --> 02:20:21.012
of care dollars that targets a

02:20:21.079 --> 02:20:22.614
specific project for that

02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:24.949
community but I don't think

02:20:25.016 --> 02:20:26.751
it's going to be enough. I am

02:20:26.818 --> 02:20:30.889
at the population grows. I

02:20:30.955 --> 02:20:32.657
would also just add that- I

02:20:32.724 --> 02:20:34.692
think there are hidden pockets

02:20:34.759 --> 02:20:37.095
of. Senior veterans which I

02:20:37.162 --> 02:20:39.097
believe steep back addressing

02:20:39.164 --> 02:20:41.065
his comments- what we're

02:20:41.132 --> 02:20:42.834
finding of those. You know I'm

02:20:42.901 --> 02:20:44.936
roughly. With Chris last

02:20:45.003 --> 02:20:46.805
surveyed last year's side I'm

02:20:46.871 --> 02:20:48.973
saying eight hundred one

02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:52.644
thousand seniors. I'm sorry

02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:54.946
that is a good section of those

02:20:55.013 --> 02:20:55.547
are seniors and a good number

02:20:55.613 --> 02:20:57.015
of those are living a month to

02:20:57.081 --> 02:20:58.750
month- because of their

02:20:58.817 --> 02:21:02.353
inability to manage their own

02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:04.856
care and services and- finances

02:21:04.923 --> 02:21:07.025
and so we find ourselves at

02:21:07.091 --> 02:21:08.893
those properties I don't have

02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:10.795
any. Veterans services but

02:21:10.862 --> 02:21:12.864
print at all using our case

02:21:12.931 --> 02:21:14.833
management team to try to help

02:21:14.899 --> 02:21:16.901
those that's of find their soup

02:21:16.968 --> 02:21:18.870
long term sustainable housing

02:21:18.937 --> 02:21:20.905
options even though they may be

02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:23.107
living in. A unit that- they

02:21:23.174 --> 02:21:26.444
were eligible for fifteen years

02:21:26.511 --> 02:21:28.546
ago that was fifty or 60%

02:21:28.613 --> 02:21:32.684
average median income unit.

02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:33.151
We're seeing a growing

02:21:33.218 --> 02:21:34.719
population of senior veterans

02:21:34.786 --> 02:21:35.320
who are not sustainable in the

02:21:35.386 --> 02:21:38.556
current living situation. Well

02:21:38.623 --> 02:21:40.892
thank you all again for joining

02:21:40.959 --> 02:21:42.827
us today really appreciate your

02:21:42.894 --> 02:21:44.996
perspective on all of your work

02:21:45.063 --> 02:21:46.865
leadership on this issue. Armed

02:21:46.931 --> 02:21:48.800
with that will go ahead and

02:21:48.867 --> 02:21:50.735
this panel and I will open it

02:21:50.802 --> 02:21:52.503
up for public comment there's-

02:21:52.570 --> 02:21:54.906
anyone who would like to make a

02:21:54.973 --> 02:22:06.918
statement. Yes. I'm Jeff

02:22:06.985 --> 02:22:07.518
storeroom retired colonel in

02:22:07.585 --> 02:22:10.989
the United States Army and have

02:22:11.055 --> 02:22:14.559
face these issues. Going to tap.

02:22:14.626 --> 02:22:17.028
With a everyone else plus

02:22:17.095 --> 02:22:18.963
happen to deal with some other

02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:19.530
things related to transition

02:22:19.597 --> 02:22:24.903
out. The comments today and

02:22:24.969 --> 02:22:25.503
please correct me if I'm wrong

02:22:25.570 --> 02:22:29.140
but I. This is a systemic wide

02:22:29.207 --> 02:22:31.209
problem it seems like it's not

02:22:31.276 --> 02:22:32.677
only dealing with armed

02:22:32.744 --> 02:22:35.113
California issues- but also at

02:22:35.179 --> 02:22:38.783
the federal level. And also

02:22:38.850 --> 02:22:39.384
with the department of defense

02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:41.119
and the military. It seems to

02:22:41.185 --> 02:22:42.887
me the re the weekly today was

02:22:42.954 --> 02:22:44.789
our consultation or liaison

02:22:44.856 --> 02:22:46.724
with the department of defense

02:22:46.791 --> 02:22:50.828
not. A senior- but with our

02:22:50.895 --> 02:22:55.199
local you scraps in. All those

02:22:55.266 --> 02:22:56.968
liaisons and me. But if we

02:22:57.035 --> 02:23:01.139
don't are. My sense is it not

02:23:01.205 --> 02:23:01.739
commanders perhaps don't know

02:23:01.806 --> 02:23:03.174
about a lot of things that we

02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:06.644
have discussed today terms of

02:23:06.711 --> 02:23:07.211
all the problems are being.

02:23:07.278 --> 02:23:07.779
Despite our doubts when they

02:23:07.845 --> 02:23:11.316
get out. So I went out of the

02:23:11.382 --> 02:23:17.021
service com PTSD- and- I also

02:23:17.088 --> 02:23:17.622
out of the service in a state

02:23:17.689 --> 02:23:20.692
of. Shock being in the service

02:23:20.758 --> 02:23:21.292
for thirty years going back to

02:23:21.359 --> 02:23:27.465
the suit in world. And in just

02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:28.967
like wow what what is office.

02:23:29.033 --> 02:23:29.467
He now is very different

02:23:29.534 --> 02:23:34.906
culture of very different unity.

02:23:34.973 --> 02:23:35.506
About this is not only do we

02:23:35.573 --> 02:23:36.874
seems like would really doing

02:23:36.941 --> 02:23:38.676
some really cool things here

02:23:38.743 --> 02:23:40.878
once got that. And then

02:23:40.945 --> 02:23:42.947
transitional state in town.

02:23:43.014 --> 02:23:44.515
Someone before that seems to me

02:23:44.582 --> 02:23:46.718
like if we're not doing this we

02:23:46.784 --> 02:23:47.185
need to get together

02:23:47.251 --> 02:23:48.686
commanders. To tell about the

02:23:48.753 --> 02:23:50.488
state of affairs of what had.

02:23:50.555 --> 02:23:52.590
Happened into their military

02:23:52.657 --> 02:23:54.926
that's when they leave. And how

02:23:54.993 --> 02:23:56.394
is it that they can better

02:23:56.461 --> 02:23:58.963
assess there are military

02:23:59.030 --> 02:24:00.898
members water still in the

02:24:00.965 --> 02:24:03.101
service getting out. Not just

02:24:03.167 --> 02:24:04.836
tap program but maybe at the

02:24:04.902 --> 02:24:07.005
end of July but level. And I

02:24:07.071 --> 02:24:07.638
was thinking that- it may not

02:24:07.705 --> 02:24:10.908
in terms of our area maybe

02:24:10.975 --> 02:24:11.542
something might be it National

02:24:11.609 --> 02:24:13.111
Guard or reserves. Our local

02:24:13.177 --> 02:24:14.645
communities and perhaps a Los

02:24:14.712 --> 02:24:15.279
Alameda this might be a good

02:24:15.346 --> 02:24:16.914
place. To think about doing

02:24:16.981 --> 02:24:18.916
something like this I just

02:24:18.983 --> 02:24:20.818
thought about this today as we

02:24:20.885 --> 02:24:22.687
were talking I don't have a

02:24:22.754 --> 02:24:24.622
concept for you of operations

02:24:24.689 --> 02:24:26.691
about how to do it. But I think

02:24:26.758 --> 02:24:30.762
this is a weak blank. And just

02:24:30.828 --> 02:24:31.295
a- brief story when I was

02:24:31.362 --> 02:24:39.103
leaving. Bar tab. The dial the-

02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:40.772
often decided at the last

02:24:40.838 --> 02:24:42.907
minute. To pay. Me up bus. Are

02:24:42.974 --> 02:24:44.675
normally you're paid in the

02:24:44.742 --> 02:24:47.211
military or two weeks they

02:24:47.278 --> 02:24:47.812
decided we're not going to pay

02:24:47.879 --> 02:24:50.715
your mid March. So you're gonna

02:24:50.782 --> 02:24:51.282
have to get out and then you

02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.916
will get your- another month or

02:24:51.983 --> 02:24:56.687
so. Our I was livid. And so

02:24:56.754 --> 02:25:00.858
when I got when I got out I

02:25:00.925 --> 02:25:02.994
went home I wrote an email to

02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:03.561
fenced financial accounting

02:25:03.628 --> 02:25:06.731
agency. Yeah when this is

02:25:06.798 --> 02:25:09.367
what's going on- and I didn't

02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:11.235
quite to in this manner the

02:25:11.302 --> 02:25:13.204
weather in forty five minutes

02:25:13.271 --> 02:25:17.075
of surprise the call from the

02:25:17.141 --> 02:25:18.910
CEO bass wondering what. I'm in

02:25:18.976 --> 02:25:21.479
my Ste and so I told them what

02:25:21.546 --> 02:25:25.049
was going on and she said we

02:25:25.116 --> 02:25:27.118
will handle this. And then the

02:25:27.185 --> 02:25:27.752
five minutes I got a call from

02:25:27.819 --> 02:25:29.220
my own posts and they said we

02:25:29.287 --> 02:25:31.155
are going to take care of this

02:25:31.222 --> 02:25:36.794
problem and we are going. To

02:25:36.861 --> 02:25:37.395
give me math Hey to all these

02:25:37.462 --> 02:25:44.869
people who are get out. One is

02:25:44.936 --> 02:25:45.503
going to happen in the military

02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:46.838
is was senior ship there for

02:25:46.904 --> 02:25:48.606
our senior leadership gets

02:25:48.673 --> 02:25:51.042
upset enough and create. Climb

02:25:51.109 --> 02:25:53.044
in in a situation immediate

02:25:53.111 --> 02:25:54.879
action so what else that may be

02:25:54.946 --> 02:25:55.513
helpful to understand about the

02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:56.614
military. Miss Parker

02:25:56.681 --> 02:26:01.285
bureaucracy but when. Senior

02:26:01.352 --> 02:26:04.622
leaders decide to take action.

02:26:04.689 --> 02:26:08.960
I guess colonels or so. Thanks

02:26:09.026 --> 02:26:10.828
very quickly which means also

02:26:10.895 --> 02:26:14.899
they can make impediments. To

02:26:14.966 --> 02:26:15.500
rock things taking place like

02:26:15.566 --> 02:26:21.005
tap. Now in terms of out to

02:26:21.072 --> 02:26:23.040
help it's called on the rise

02:26:23.107 --> 02:26:23.641
strength of the unit and then

02:26:23.708 --> 02:26:27.311
science. And often times the

02:26:27.378 --> 02:26:28.980
size of this very well so

02:26:29.046 --> 02:26:31.082
people who must be going to

02:26:31.149 --> 02:26:32.717
tapped on Kobe as any to do

02:26:32.783 --> 02:26:35.086
other things with the unit. And

02:26:35.153 --> 02:26:36.721
so these math the things that

02:26:36.787 --> 02:26:38.589
management to be more aware of

02:26:38.656 --> 02:26:42.493
two. So anyway are. Very much

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:43.027
well. Thank you for your

02:26:43.094 --> 02:26:43.661

02:26:45.496 --> 02:26:48.733
veterans Advisory Council. Good

02:26:48.799 --> 02:26:49.333
afternoon my name is Khan the

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:54.539
city of Costa mesa. Mayor Foley

02:26:54.605 --> 02:26:55.139
are was- present that she had

02:26:55.206 --> 02:26:56.674
another and that she had to

02:26:56.741 --> 02:26:57.241
attend she asked me to make

02:26:57.308 --> 02:26:58.843
some notes on her behalf today.

02:26:58.910 --> 02:26:59.343
Firstly she's extremely

02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:01.012
grateful to these only members

02:27:02.914 --> 02:27:03.481
in the city of Costa mesa and

02:27:03.548 --> 02:27:05.149
for the special attention being

02:27:05.216 --> 02:27:08.553
paid to this concern. Since

02:27:08.619 --> 02:27:09.086
twenty four Costa mesa's

02:27:09.153 --> 02:27:11.322
network for homeless shins

02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:13.224
assisted one hundred and

02:27:13.291 --> 02:27:13.858
seventy two almost turns in the

02:27:13.925 --> 02:27:17.195
city. In April of this year the

02:27:17.261 --> 02:27:20.565
city almost assisted. Twelve

02:27:20.631 --> 02:27:24.602
turns and house two of them. So

02:27:24.669 --> 02:27:27.238
far Costa mesa Sir is being

02:27:27.305 --> 02:27:28.573
funded from existing source.

02:27:28.639 --> 02:27:32.910
All fund so additional funding

02:27:32.977 --> 02:27:35.146
for six the step up to for to

02:27:35.213 --> 02:27:36.847
provide these services directly

02:27:36.914 --> 02:27:37.415
great prove their ability to

02:27:37.481 --> 02:27:39.350
serve our state. Mayor Philip

02:27:39.417 --> 02:27:41.018
also wanted to share a little

02:27:41.085 --> 02:27:41.619
personal insight based on her

02:27:41.686 --> 02:27:42.153
brother's experience who

02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:42.687
recently medically retired

02:27:42.753 --> 02:27:43.287
twenty three years serving in

02:27:43.354 --> 02:27:46.591
the United States are.

02:27:46.657 --> 02:27:47.091
Merrilees call to action

02:27:47.158 --> 02:27:50.995
include first allow cities who

02:27:51.062 --> 02:27:51.629
are serving homeless and direct

02:27:51.696 --> 02:27:52.196
access to funds that having

02:27:52.263 --> 02:27:55.266
through an agency. Second close

02:27:55.333 --> 02:27:56.901
the gap for veterans receive a

02:27:56.968 --> 02:27:57.535
letter health insurance but you

02:27:57.602 --> 02:27:58.769
cannot have prescriptions

02:27:58.836 --> 02:28:01.072
filled if they're not the

02:28:01.138 --> 02:28:02.773
debate or the VA. For example

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:04.842
her brother was recently

02:28:04.909 --> 02:28:05.443
visiting. Desperately needed

02:28:05.509 --> 02:28:07.245
his medication he was able to

02:28:07.311 --> 02:28:07.878
fulfill the prescription from

02:28:07.945 --> 02:28:09.347
the are at the or at the local

02:28:09.413 --> 02:28:13.050
yes because it would cost him

02:28:13.117 --> 02:28:13.618
six hundred dollars when he

02:28:13.684 --> 02:28:14.986
normally would have paid thirty

02:28:15.052 --> 02:28:17.221
dollars six. Thirty continue to

02:28:17.288 --> 02:28:19.156
inventory all appropriate state

02:28:19.223 --> 02:28:22.693
county and federal. Expedite

02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:23.327
the building a veteran work for

02:28:23.394 --> 02:28:24.829
housing because it is law legal

02:28:24.895 --> 02:28:27.431
and values that prevent us from

02:28:27.498 --> 02:28:27.999
hopping hopping affordable

02:28:28.065 --> 02:28:29.300
rates. Like the veterans who

02:28:29.367 --> 02:28:31.235
spoke today heard many stories

02:28:31.302 --> 02:28:32.870
of veterans in the community

02:28:32.937 --> 02:28:34.939
spending nearly fifty percent.

02:28:35.006 --> 02:28:35.506
Their income on renting a

02:28:35.573 --> 02:28:37.041
smaller more. That is

02:28:37.108 --> 02:28:41.245
unsustainable. Thank you again

02:28:41.312 --> 02:28:47.084
for your. You for bringing this

02:28:47.151 --> 02:28:48.653
hearing Sacramento in into the

02:28:48.719 --> 02:28:50.621
city of Khost the- mayor fully

02:28:50.688 --> 02:28:51.155
looks for working with our

02:28:51.222 --> 02:28:51.656
assembly representative.

02:28:51.722 --> 02:28:52.590
Between and each of you.

02:28:52.657 --> 02:28:53.190
Collaboratively in any way she

02:28:53.257 --> 02:28:56.927
can thank you again. To make a

02:28:56.994 --> 02:29:00.798
payment. Thank you again to all

02:29:00.865 --> 02:29:01.432
of our panelists for joining us

02:29:01.499 --> 02:29:04.735
today and for your leadership

02:29:04.802 --> 02:29:06.804
and focus on this issue I think

02:29:06.871 --> 02:29:08.539
my two big takeaways number one

02:29:08.606 --> 02:29:10.708
I think there's a lot as our

02:29:10.775 --> 02:29:12.843
incredible progress being made

02:29:12.910 --> 02:29:14.779
here in Orange County to

02:29:14.845 --> 02:29:17.081
address the crisis of veteran

02:29:17.148 --> 02:29:18.816
homelessness and to achieve the

02:29:18.883 --> 02:29:20.751
goal of any veteran

02:29:20.818 --> 02:29:22.753
homelessness in twenty twenty

02:29:22.820 --> 02:29:24.789
and I think my other. Major

02:29:24.855 --> 02:29:26.590
take away is that clearly a lot

02:29:26.657 --> 02:29:28.926
has to go wrong and there's

02:29:28.993 --> 02:29:30.728
gonna be a lot of cracks that

02:29:30.795 --> 02:29:31.362
someone slips through in order

02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:33.030
for veteran to wind up homeless

02:29:33.097 --> 02:29:36.734
and it does feel like so often

02:29:36.801 --> 02:29:38.669
we do not take action until

02:29:38.736 --> 02:29:40.671
it's a crisis and so I would

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:42.573
love to. Be part of a continued

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:44.608
recession on how can we do our

02:29:44.675 --> 02:29:47.044
job before it for people- speed

02:29:47.111 --> 02:29:47.678
through the cracks how can we

02:29:47.745 --> 02:29:50.681
invest more in prevention and

02:29:50.748 --> 02:29:51.115
more in early stage

02:29:51.182 --> 02:29:54.852
intervention. So with that

02:29:54.919 --> 02:29:55.419
thank you all for joining us

02:29:55.486 --> 02:30:12.937
and we are to
