WEBVTT

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:32.238
To kind of navigate the the real

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:32.905
estate market and we think it's

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.340
a it's a good place to be it's a

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:35.008
good space to be in because it's

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:36.476
it's an affordable space and

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:38.111
it's also --

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:40.313
A very sustainable space --

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.148
Once you get the formulas down

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:44.350
so I'm gonna quickly go over a

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:44.984
couple projects were doing --

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.586
Just to kind of show.

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:48.321
The concept and then I can get

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:50.256
into my opinions on my car

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:50.923
housing in Michael can you hold

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.160
the microphone close enough yeah

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:56.095
sorry my arm is a a little.

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:58.097
Got on my own microphone stand --

00:04:58.164 --> 00:04:58.731
Okay so here we go this is --

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.366
A property we are currently

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.402
developing in Logan heights --

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.604
It's seventy five hundred square

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.205
foot lot in which we are able to

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.107
get municipal code.

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:10.009
Legally what.

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:14.280
I'm special permissions right

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:16.449
twenty one it the the lock was

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.351
to seize on law and it was

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:20.086
really only allowing five units

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:20.420
to be built.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.755
And so use and density bonus and

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.457
then we use an FAA are bonus to

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:26.693
squeeze in twenty one small

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.127
apartments which would have

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:28.661
normally been five large

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.196
apartments --

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:32.331
And that's gonna house twenty

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:34.233
one people this specific project

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.467
we are.

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:36.402
Really hoping and we're we're

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.736
targeting --

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:38.504
Specifically --

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:40.707
X. homeless veterans who hold

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:42.608
the veteran voucher from the VA.

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:44.444
Okay and then --

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.245
Another one we're doing --

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:48.247
This one is an escrow on of a

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:48.815
lot that's about fourteen

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:50.216
thousand square feet --

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:52.452
Were able to fit forty two of

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:52.985
these micro units on this

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:54.253
property --

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.322
The normal allowance for this

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.191
would have been fourteen large.

00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:00.293
Town homes or apartments so you

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:02.795
can see are maximizing the dirt

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.163
to fit as many houses as we

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.265
cannot even other small.

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:14.273
So -- So --

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.841
She's my little assistant.

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:16.242
So -- So

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.843
that tech kind of give you an

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.377
idea of what we can do with each

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:18.778
size of what --

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:20.580
And also to know these are half

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.615
market rate and half of them are

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:24.317
deed restricted we're working

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:26.219
with any of housing commission.

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:26.719
In order to do waste --

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:30.456
Mixed use contact with just on

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:32.125
chorus -- I

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:34.227
can show you what we could do if

00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:36.162
that say we had unlimited money --

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.264
This is a one acre lot also in

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:38.898
Logan heights and we would be

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:42.135
able to if permitted and funded.

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:42.702
Bill three hundred of these

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:44.737
units and this would be more of

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:45.304
a permanent supportive care

00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:48.107
housing facility --

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:50.209
This property --

00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:50.843
At of it's been in and out of

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.044
Esther a bunch of times the they

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:52.478
keep calling us --

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.313
And the reason is because the

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:54.881
affordable developers can't

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:56.482
close on the deal due to the

00:06:56.549 --> 00:07:00.253
financing. For some reason they

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:00.853
can't get their financing --

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.688
So that's something I would love

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.423
to tackle it's it's an ambitious

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.058
one who knows maybe we'll get

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:06.392
there okay.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:08.528
So just kind of cap over at this

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.029
was -- I was

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:10.563
showing this to the home a

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.230
select committee kind of showing

00:07:11.297 --> 00:07:13.132
how much dirt we need to go how

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.433
many units so on seventy five

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.235
hundred square feet we are able --

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:18.271
To fit twenty one units.

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.139
Fourteen thousand square feet

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:20.807
forty two units and if you give

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:22.308
us an anchor we can fit over

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:22.942
three hundred units in this is

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:24.143
all housing people --

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.712
And so that's kind of confusing

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.648
idea of per square foot what we

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:32.151
can build --

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:34.187
So the the construction we're

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:36.189
using is a modular construction

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:36.789
we're choosing to you shipping

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.157
containers --

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:38.791
There's other types of modular

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:40.393
construction they're sticking

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:42.261
brick modular there is metal

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:44.263
panels much of those concrete

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.998
paneling modular --

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:46.632
And the benefits of these at

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.234
this that they're built in

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.336
factories off site and then the

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:52.271
units are are fully furnished

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:52.705
and then delivered.

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:54.507
And then we just place them on

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:56.309
site with crane and there you go

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.311
there's your there's your unit

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:00.179
your apartment --

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:02.048
Some of the benefits of this is

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:02.248
this.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.183
Speed is an obvious benefit --

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.185
Because it allows for the

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:06.853
development to could be going on

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:08.421
while you're also being

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:10.256
permitted for your site control.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:10.957
And these things are approved at

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.625
state level so the city doesn't

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:14.227
take the permitting liability --

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:16.495
The state does and then is

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:20.166
delivered in all out.

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.134
Twice what it would take to

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:22.768
build it sticks and bricks on

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.070
the site --

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:26.172
Another cool factor this that we

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:26.505
didn't know.

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:28.574
Was that if we are forced to use

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:30.142
prevailing wages which a lot of

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:30.743
portable buildings are and and

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.111
that's a good.

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.080
Good thing to be using --

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:36.182
One of the challenges with

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:38.084
affordable development is that

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:38.551
there's such expensive

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:38.918
developments --

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.319
Typically in affordable

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:42.388
development will cost four

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:42.955
hundred thousand dollars per

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:46.092
residents delivered --

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:46.759
We've been able to deliver ours

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.361
were we think we're gonna do

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:50.463
four hundred and forty thousand

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:51.063
actually might even do it for

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.331
less -- But

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:54.233
on the affordable side the

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:54.901
prevailing wage costs is cut by

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:58.337
a third because most of the work

00:08:58.404 --> 00:08:58.971
is being done off site in the

00:08:59.038 --> 00:08:59.238
factory.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.106
So -- That

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:02.208
will help affordable developers

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:04.110
with their bottom line --

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:04.744
Also cool part of is that the

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.412
its its warranty it's similar to

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:06.712
a cars so.

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:08.347
If something goes wrong you know

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:10.182
who who to call --

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:12.318
So that's what we're doing.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.353
So this this.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.489
Power point was really geared

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:17.156
toward homelessness so I'm going

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.457
to quickly go through this

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:20.359
because we are aye I'm on the

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:22.361
board a path connections and so.

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:24.130
That's kind of where I focus --

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:26.198
Our efforts --

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:28.501
Most skip this one so what we're

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:30.269
trying to do is rent to homeless

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:32.505
people and partner with service

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:34.307
providers by using a masterpiece

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:36.142
meaning instead of renting each

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:36.442
unit -- One

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.477
at a time we are hoping to rent

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:40.579
the entire property --

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:42.381
Under master these which for a

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:44.250
landlord that means one check

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:46.118
and for the service provider.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:46.719
That means they've got a whole

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.521
property in which they can run

00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:50.289
their services we also don't

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:50.957
need a conditional use permit if

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:52.491
we do a master lease --

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:54.226
And that's also another benefit

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:56.195
of master leasing versus doing

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:56.762
permits support of care --

00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:58.564
It's a much more streamlined

00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:02.101
process --

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:02.735
This is the master leasing I was

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:06.405
talking about so happy landlord --

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:06.806
Makes it simple.

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:10.042
So.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:12.178
This is the strategy here serve

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:12.712
of basically there's some

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:14.013
strategies for mass releasing

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.513
because the the service

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.315
providers need service money and

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:18.150
they also hold liability because

00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:18.551
their clients --

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:20.553
They can't be the landlord to

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:22.254
their own client so we have to

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:22.888
have a property manager in the

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.523
middle and then the owner.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.459
And that's the structure of how

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:28.361
you master these so the service

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:30.329
writer rents pays the manager

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:30.963
the manager in the landlord.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.498
Manage the property for the

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:34.233
service provider --

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.068
And so.

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.304
Service money is a big deal I

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:40.039
don't know if this is the right

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:40.606
panel to be speaking about

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:42.408
service money on but I will tell

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.210
you the almost service providers.

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:44.810
Really needs service money in

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:46.545
order to be able to rent from

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:48.314
typical landlords the concept is

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:50.416
if we can build this thing so

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.251
can any other builder and that

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:52.651
opens up a new.

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:54.387
Supply chain for service

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:56.522
providers who need housing for

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:58.090
their outgoing --

00:10:58.157 --> 00:10:58.391
Clients --

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:00.426
X. almost people that are in

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.161
care -- And

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:04.096
so the service monies really

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:04.730
important right now the service

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:08.300
providers really need about ten

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:08.868
thousand dollars per client

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:09.201
every year.

00:11:09.268 --> 00:11:10.569
Plus the rent money in order to

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:12.204
have a successful --

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:16.042
Non reoccurrence of homelessness.

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:18.577
So and that solutions lesson so

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:19.145
far one of the things about

00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:20.312
micro housing --

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.081
Is that --

00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:24.283
Really helps the middle income

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.550
level --

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:26.252
What we see in San Diego as we

00:11:26.318 --> 00:11:26.852
have all these houses that a

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:28.454
three bedroom two bedroom three

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.189
bedroom two bath houses?

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:30.489
That -- Are

00:11:30.556 --> 00:11:32.258
still does roommates --

00:11:32.324 --> 00:11:34.360
I know I was one once my brother

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.362
is one and and and people are

00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:38.197
even families your even

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:40.099
cohabitating --

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:40.666
Where there's the you know

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:44.103
single parents sharing a house --

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.038
Two separate families and so

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:46.672
with this micro housing concept

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:48.441
really offers that we haven't

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:50.142
seen in San Diego.

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:50.709
Is that roommates now have

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:52.211
another option.

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:54.480
So instead of renting a room and

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.582
sharing a hundred or two hundred

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.551
dollars more a month you get

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:00.186
your own apartment --

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:02.121
Your own bathroom your own

00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:02.788
kitchen cinnamon stealing your

00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:04.290
leftovers I know that was I was

00:12:04.356 --> 00:12:06.292
always the problem for me.

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:10.129
And and your own pocket so --

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:12.098
It really does.

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:12.531
Fill that need --

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.333
And so but there are challenges

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:14.967
and so my partner is going to

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:16.569
speak to some of the challenges

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.070
we've had some financing

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:18.637
challenges of their concept

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:20.206
because it is mixed use market

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:20.406
rate.

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:22.441
Deed restricted a sorrows as a

00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:24.176
commercial space --

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.412
And so all that him touch on

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:26.612
that.

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:28.447
Okay [inaudible]

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.049
Right.

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:32.184
Thank you Michael on as that

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:32.852
takes over if you need to take

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:34.587
off we understand you thank you

00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:36.222
so much of it as you dogs

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:38.157
extremely well behaved very

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:38.557
impressed with.

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:39.125
Demanded housing development

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.428
skills thank you she's much more

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:48.067
professional than me yes --

00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:48.667
I'm my name's Doug arms I'm

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.603
going to see if you all don't

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:52.071
mind.

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:54.039
The more comfortable that way --

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:54.607
My Michael's partner in --

00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:56.342
Makana properties and I've been

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:56.942
and developer builder and San

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:58.477
Diego for thirty plus years now

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:00.079
so I have.

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:02.114
A great deal of experience in

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:03.983
non affordable housing.

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:04.617
Building and construction I met

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:07.987
up with.

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:10.089
Years ago and you tell me what

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:10.723
it was doing in the affordable

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.491
housing space and I got really

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:14.393
excited about it so I partnered

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.162
up with him.

00:13:16.228 --> 00:13:18.397
And here we are today.

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.366
So we've we've come up with the

00:13:20.432 --> 00:13:20.633
concept --

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:24.570
Of he didn't he didn't mention

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.071
this bed were worried needed

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:26.705
mission were using the modular

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.207
housing.

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:30.543
Another piece of our model is

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:30.743
that.

00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:32.278
We're really seeking no public

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:34.446
financing so.

00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:36.215
Our project is under percent

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:38.217
privately financed and we

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:40.019
believe that.

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:40.586
With the efficiency of the

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:44.056
construction method for the at

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:46.192
the container units both in

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:48.194
terms of entitlements and

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.062
construction.

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:52.131
Paired with the private

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:54.200
financing model.

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:56.202
We have a very.

00:13:56.268 --> 00:13:56.802
Viable solution to putting a

00:13:56.869 --> 00:13:58.470
dent in the affordable housing

00:13:58.537 --> 00:14:00.573
crisis that it's probably better

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:04.076
than most because our time from.

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:04.577
Property acquisition to

00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:06.111
completion.

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:07.947
We are targeting less than a

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:08.147
year.

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:22.161
Which is pretty impressive --

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:22.828
Michael talked about the pastor

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:23.996
least being.

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:24.296
Concept --

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:26.532
Service provider or some other

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:26.832
[inaudible]

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:28.100
Writer --

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.236
I'm gonna talk about the

00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:32.037
possibilities of not getting the

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:32.705
masterly switches which you know

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:34.473
where we're kind of learning as

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:34.707
we go.

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:35.241
Because it's such a novel

00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:38.143
concept --

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.212
We don't know for gonna get

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:42.081
master these or not still all

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:44.216
our alternative.

00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:46.118
Our water are there.

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:48.153
We have some problems in our of

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.489
alter are took his his me of our

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.291
alternatives --

00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:54.493
So are a project requires no

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:54.893
public financing.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.462
Were currently working with the

00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:58.330
housing commission to read

00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:00.566
restrict but technically we're

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:06.005
not required --

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:06.572
To we are passionate about

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:08.507
affordable housing and we want

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.476
to make this an affordable

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:10.876
housing project.

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:12.745
The housing commission for the

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:16.048
S. R. O. S. R. O. units.

00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:18.550
Is providing a voucher rate

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:18.817
rental --

00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:22.221
80% of area median income.

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:24.556
Which is which makes the prop

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:26.191
economically feasible.

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:30.262
IBM is is that permanent lenders.

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:32.331
Don't land on tenant based

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:34.199
vouchers there's going to look

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.368
at the market rate [inaudible]

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:36.535
So.

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:40.105
In order for us as an incentive.

00:15:40.172 --> 00:15:42.308
To make this an intolerable

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.009
affordable housing project.

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:46.312
We're trying to work a system

00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:48.447
out with the housing commission.

00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:50.215
And the city of San Diego

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:54.153
council to come up with a way.

00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:54.720
To essentially guarantee --

00:15:54.787 --> 00:16:07.366
As a voucher rate grant for all

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:08.300
of our units Doug I'm very

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:10.502
started wretched there may be a

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:11.103
problem with that particular

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.073
microphone would you mind using

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:16.275
the wireless one okay okay.

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:22.047
If you -- So.

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:22.681
So what we're trying to get a

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:24.316
day rental guarantee on the

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:24.883
battery units in order to

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.120
incentivize as to not make to to

00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:30.089
make that the project affordable --

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:32.057
The current no for is.

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:32.624
Available to the San Diego

00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:34.159
housing commission --

00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:35.961
Really.

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:38.230
Don't we don't have any

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:40.099
opportunities in those no phase --

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.468
The way they are structured now

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:44.069
to get any subsidies.

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:48.107
From San Diego San Diego housing

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:48.741
commission so what we're really

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:48.974
doing.

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:50.376
Is appealing to the city of San

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:52.144
Diego.

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:54.346
Council in mayor to come up with

00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:56.181
another funding source to

00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:57.983
subsidize our vouchers.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.219
At if we don't you know we do

00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:02.221
there are options are going to

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:04.256
it and entirely market rate.

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:06.225
Project and you know maybe

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:08.293
having to step out of the

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.195
affordable space.

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:12.297
So our theory is this the

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:14.433
housing commission right now is.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.201
Paying --

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:18.370
Current SRO owners.

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:20.439
Quite a bit of money to extend

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:22.274
their as sorrows for another ten

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:24.076
years --

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:28.213
When we're offering? Twenty one

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:28.847
brand new as sorrows into the

00:17:28.914 --> 00:17:30.215
housing stock.

00:17:30.282 --> 00:17:32.217
In our only request is that we

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:34.253
get some sort of voucher rent

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:36.054
subsidy.

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:38.123
So we're thinking that.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.791
If we push hard enough we can

00:17:38.857 --> 00:17:40.292
probably get make make a

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:44.029
solution out of that --

00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:46.165
The concept is scalable if we

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:48.367
are able to get through our

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:50.068
financing hurdles.

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:52.337
We could do this we could put

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.506
three to four hundred units.

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:56.341
On the street in the next two to

00:17:56.408 --> 00:18:00.179
three years and which is far

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:02.147
ahead of your typical.

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:02.481
Tax credit.

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.349
Affordable housing developers so

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:06.251
we're really excited about the

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:08.120
concept.

00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:08.754
And we'll have to see where it

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:12.057
goes.

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:14.193
Thank you dot org of what

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:15.961
transition out of Mister gentry

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:18.030
for going to secure nay --

00:18:18.096 --> 00:18:20.132
We think your patience while we

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:20.699
took care of Michael on the

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:22.501
child care needs that I know you

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:26.205
understand that kind of stuff --

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:30.142
Problem around Todd in.

00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:34.012
The streaking of the weather.

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:34.613
Is one of the good folks at

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.482
recruited me and brought me here

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:42.087
ten years ago.

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:44.122
Rain is fine --

00:18:44.189 --> 00:18:46.024
Let me.

00:18:46.091 --> 00:18:46.558
Set a little bit of a a

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.093
perspective here on the nature

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.295
of the problem well we've got it

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:52.064
for the missing metal that is.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.433
And instrument hope the dog that

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.268
well we're working on with you

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:58.070
and mark we can make work out.

00:18:58.136 --> 00:19:00.239
There sure is taking money that

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:02.074
flows down.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.076
In vertical streams with.

00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:06.111
Rooms and and regulations and

00:19:06.178 --> 00:19:07.980
restrictions attached to it.

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:10.349
Which makes me think about it

00:19:10.415 --> 00:19:10.983
and nobody in their right mind

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:12.184
going hand on order and

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.986
taxpayers money.

00:19:14.052 --> 00:19:14.553
Local government officials

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.421
without some strings attached to

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:18.023
it they're just not going to

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:18.257
happen.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.158
Initial making sure the the the

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:24.096
the attached requirements.

00:19:24.162 --> 00:19:24.763
Are dapple adaptable enough to

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.431
fit local circumstances which

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:28.000
may not always fit.

00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:30.369
Then is out of the funding

00:19:30.435 --> 00:19:32.337
trains in this part of the

00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:34.006
mission here.

00:19:34.072 --> 00:19:38.010
In a large room or broader sense.

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:42.247
This whole issue of housing

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:44.182
commission was set up nearly

00:19:44.249 --> 00:19:46.251
forty years ago. To serve the

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:48.520
housing needs primarily people

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:50.322
who are low and moderate income.

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:52.491
And that's typically low income

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:56.194
is typically defined as 80% of

00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:56.595
median whatever.

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:58.297
In our most all of the money

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:00.332
that comes in to us is for folks

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:04.102
that.

00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:06.104
Income level or lower.

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:08.240
Most Mister over 50% of median

00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:10.042
or less some.

00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:10.576
Begin in the homelessness

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:12.110
Arambula.

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:12.711
Or elderly and disabled folks

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:14.246
30% or less.

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:16.114
Of reach of those are the name

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:16.515
for a subsidy --

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:20.285
Addition in order to make the

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:21.954
the economics work.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:22.621
The issue is what happens when

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:24.523
you get into folks in the middle

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:37.102
income range.

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:38.136
Which is typically defined as

00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:42.307
about depending on their own

00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:46.111
circumstances.

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:46.345
Number.

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:52.084
Of a that --

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.186
With those people --

00:20:54.252 --> 00:20:56.388
Which creates a problem let me

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:58.190
give you an example.

00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:58.857
If you go back about eight years

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.025
ago.

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:00.559
In the middle of the Great

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:02.194
Recession.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:02.794
The housing commission which

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.229
among other --

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:05.998
Programs under that bridge about

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:06.665
thirty seven hundred and as hard

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:10.168
and it's of housing --

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:12.304
Which have Reyes of degrees of

00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:14.206
subsidy attached to it.

00:21:14.272 --> 00:21:16.441
We had a turnover rate of about

00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:18.043
35% per year.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.412
So over a three year time period

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:21.013
would you won't turn over the

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:24.182
inventory.

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:25.951
People have something new.

00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:26.618
To in one of the server running

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:28.420
is a plan to the Great Recession

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:30.088
is over a lot there was a lot of

00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:30.722
naturally occurring affordable

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.124
housing developed.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.126
And available back then.

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:36.028
When I moved to Tara biggest

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:37.963
housing problems for closures?

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.232
We had more housing bills and

00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:42.401
then then the market could take

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:44.136
care.

00:21:44.202 --> 00:21:48.073
So the issue background 35%.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.242
The turnover rate right now no

00:21:50.308 --> 00:21:51.977
units.

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:53.979
This 14%.

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:56.048
It takes seven noted Turner

00:21:56.114 --> 00:21:56.615
product inventory over for

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:58.183
people to move up and out.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.385
As you can you can do the math

00:22:00.452 --> 00:22:02.287
on that the difference between

00:22:02.354 --> 00:22:04.156
thirty five and 14%.

00:22:04.222 --> 00:22:06.391
Is a man's a paper to have a

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:08.560
place to move.

00:22:08.627 --> 00:22:12.064
To are you going to the private

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.066
sector about compassion from for

00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:16.034
conventional run apartments.

00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:18.170
Is 50% a year.

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:20.539
So what it tells you the people

00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:22.107
that can afford to market place

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:22.708
can move they can move up and

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:22.908
out.

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:26.044
Of people who cannot afford that.

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:26.278
Cannot.

00:22:26.344 --> 00:22:28.380
The jump in the price tag is

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:30.048
just too big.

00:22:30.115 --> 00:22:30.615
Let me give you numbers the

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:32.050
numbers just illustrates.

00:22:32.117 --> 00:22:34.086
In San Diego right now the two

00:22:34.152 --> 00:22:34.653
bedroom apartment rents for

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.555
about two thousand two hundred

00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:38.123
and seven dollars.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.025
That comes from a rich study

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:44.062
done in October of this year.

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:46.131
But I household earning 80% of

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:46.665
the area median income.

00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:48.400
Which is 770-008-0050 dollars

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:52.037
for a family of four can afford

00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:54.206
to pay using 30% should.

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:58.110
Can afford to played one

00:22:58.176 --> 00:22:58.744
thousand six hundred and seventy

00:22:58.810 --> 00:22:59.978
three dollars per month.

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:02.180
After you take out an eighty

00:23:02.247 --> 00:23:04.049
dollar adjustment for typical

00:23:04.116 --> 00:23:06.318
mentally utilities.

00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:08.153
That leaves a difference of five

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:08.787
hundred and thirty four dollars

00:23:08.854 --> 00:23:10.222
per month.

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:12.023
With a lower income hassle can

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:12.257
afford.

00:23:12.324 --> 00:23:14.359
In the market rent for two

00:23:14.426 --> 00:23:15.994
bedroom apartment.

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:18.296
And the so there's there's

00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:20.332
nothing this plus the metal

00:23:20.398 --> 00:23:21.967
between that affordability

00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:22.200
number.

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:24.436
It we'll the family can afford

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:28.006
to pay.

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:29.975
Because virtually no production

00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:30.609
a middle income housing in that

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:34.045
time period. For the period.

00:23:34.112 --> 00:23:36.047
200-010-22000.

00:23:36.114 --> 00:23:38.150
Seventeen the city of San Diego

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:38.416
produced.

00:23:38.483 --> 00:23:40.452
Only. Thirty three units and

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:44.022
that's what I mean two digits

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:44.656
three three thirty three units.

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:46.191
Of middle income housing.

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.260
In that time period.

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:52.030
Ins in seven years personal

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:52.564
population one point three

00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:56.101
million people.

00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:58.303
As is obvious this lack of

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:58.570
supply --

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:00.238
Moderate income housing.

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:02.340
Affects the the city's market

00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:04.476
place to attracting key people

00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:06.111
who are --

00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:08.180
Necessary folks but don't have a

00:24:08.246 --> 00:24:10.549
great deal of income.

00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:11.082
People are teachers first

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:14.152
respond or social services folks.

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:16.421
The need of a sentiment parleys

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:16.988
and sexual to the economy.

00:24:17.055 --> 00:24:22.027
We cannot afford the rent and in

00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:24.362
this gap is where we come to

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:28.033
carve the missing middle --

00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:30.235
This last year of Mister Gloria

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:34.139
some assembly member Gloria

00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:34.739
someone call you city council

00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:34.973
member.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.408
The assembly member Gloria --

00:24:36.474 --> 00:24:40.045
Introduced AB.

00:24:40.111 --> 00:24:42.013
Sixteen thirty seven a state --

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.647
Bill which the governor signed

00:24:42.714 --> 00:24:46.051
to learn October of last year.

00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:48.286
Which allows. To which initially

00:24:48.353 --> 00:24:50.155
allowed to public housing

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:52.057
agencies in the state.

00:24:52.123 --> 00:24:52.657
Both last June San Diego and

00:24:52.724 --> 00:24:54.292
also Santa Clara county.

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:58.096
Who -- Try

00:24:58.163 --> 00:25:00.065
this intentional so stroller

00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:02.400
developers image don't come

00:25:02.467 --> 00:25:04.202
developments where there was a

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:06.071
mixture of low income and

00:25:06.137 --> 00:25:06.671
moderate income folks in the

00:25:06.738 --> 00:25:08.139
development.

00:25:08.206 --> 00:25:10.108
And the center county San

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.010
Bernardino letter themselves of

00:25:12.077 --> 00:25:12.677
this makes this year as well.

00:25:12.744 --> 00:25:14.446
So now there are three

00:25:14.512 --> 00:25:15.981
localities here in California.

00:25:16.047 --> 00:25:18.316
Trying to make this thing work.

00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:22.621
And one of the difficulties in

00:25:22.687 --> 00:25:22.854
it is --

00:25:22.921 --> 00:25:24.522
Well when promised me set this

00:25:24.589 --> 00:25:26.291
up. For very good reason.

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:28.093
Eserver would not use any of the

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:30.428
subsidies for the lower income

00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:31.997
people.

00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:32.664
There are many properties work

00:25:32.731 --> 00:25:34.733
for moderate income people.

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:36.134
You know to cannibalize one sort

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.003
of programs in college.

00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:40.572
We're sort of problems for very

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:42.507
poor people help those were in

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:44.075
the middle.

00:25:44.142 --> 00:25:46.011
Make their own way.

00:25:46.077 --> 00:25:48.113
And it means that we the the the

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:50.015
the guy is.

00:25:50.081 --> 00:25:50.615
Wearing an experimental time

00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:52.417
period now. To try to make this

00:25:52.484 --> 00:25:55.987
thing work --

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:56.588
Will also introduce a second

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:58.123
bloom -- A.

00:25:58.189 --> 00:26:00.458
B. twenty three seventy two of

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:02.193
the casa act.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:02.827
Which will help to address the

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:04.129
same issue.

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:06.364
And what of we're going to be

00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:07.032
doing is trying to figure out a

00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:08.099
way to make.

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:14.039
Of the production missing that.

00:26:14.105 --> 00:26:16.508
The meme got too many pieces of

00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:22.113
paper homeowners.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.349
Aimed steady the the housing

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:26.151
commission produced last year

00:26:26.217 --> 00:26:27.953
like to refer you to is what I'm

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:28.586
a give you a website address for

00:26:28.653 --> 00:26:29.988
the housing commission.

00:26:30.055 --> 00:26:34.159
Is WWW dot S. the H. soon for

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:34.659
the same vehicle housing

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:37.996
commission.

00:26:38.063 --> 00:26:40.131
Dot org or just Google us.

00:26:40.198 --> 00:26:40.765
Well the stuff on the website it

00:26:40.832 --> 00:26:44.002
is a good.

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:46.171
One we produced a study by the

00:26:46.237 --> 00:26:48.173
mackenzie folks in September.

00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:50.141
Seventeen that --

00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:52.143
Identified.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.145
Goals for the city of San Diego

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:54.813
needs to produce in terms of new

00:26:54.879 --> 00:26:56.114
housing units.

00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:58.216
Over the final in ten years at

00:26:58.283 --> 00:26:58.650
all income levels.

00:26:58.717 --> 00:27:02.153
This would brown from

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.155
200-018-22000.

00:27:04.222 --> 00:27:04.789
Twenty eight and then it showed

00:27:04.856 --> 00:27:06.691
that we need to produce in order

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:08.426
to keep up and or catch up

00:27:08.493 --> 00:27:08.727
[inaudible]

00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:10.095
With.

00:27:10.161 --> 00:27:12.197
Normal projected population

00:27:12.263 --> 00:27:14.065
growth.

00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:14.699
You need to increase our housing

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:16.001
stock --

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:18.069
Anywhere from a hundred and

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:20.338
500-002-20020 thousand units of

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:20.605
housing.

00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:24.042
Over the next ten years.

00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:24.642
That means we need to produce

00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:26.111
between.

00:27:26.177 --> 00:27:27.979
Seventeen thousand new units of

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:30.048
housing to keep up.

00:27:30.115 --> 00:27:30.682
And twenty four thousand units

00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:34.052
per year to catch up.

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:36.087
Over the next ten years.

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:38.089
The largest number of housing

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:38.690
units so we produced in San

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:42.160
Diego for the last five years.

00:27:42.227 --> 00:27:44.329
Was [inaudible]

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:46.097
Six thousand four hundred well.

00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:48.199
The cost of Transoxiana higher

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:50.135
over the last few years.

00:27:50.201 --> 00:27:54.139
Supply simple supply and demand.

00:27:54.205 --> 00:27:56.107
The more demand is less ride.

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:56.441
Coasters up.

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:58.176
Who gets pushed out of the

00:27:58.243 --> 00:28:00.512
bottom and who's missing in the

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:02.180
middle?

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:04.249
This report of one out of one

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:04.883
ahead to show that this is a

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:08.019
solvable this can be dealt with.

00:28:08.086 --> 00:28:08.620
If there's no will to do it.

00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:11.990
In fact the study points out

00:28:12.057 --> 00:28:14.192
five different areas to those in

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:16.261
the study that I can going to

00:28:16.327 --> 00:28:18.029
run to a bed.

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:18.696
Was this the the housing can be

00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:20.165
produced.

00:28:20.231 --> 00:28:22.200
The was always is going to be

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:22.801
for those however who cannot

00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:24.202
afford the market place.

00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:26.304
Had a make up for of of what

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:28.006
doctor very well a few minutes

00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:28.206
ago.

00:28:28.273 --> 00:28:30.341
The gap financing to bridge

00:28:30.408 --> 00:28:32.077
between the missing level --

00:28:32.143 --> 00:28:36.014
Income rise and what they can

00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:38.216
market place.

00:28:38.283 --> 00:28:40.118
Thank you.

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:42.153
Thank you Mister gentry --

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.022
It will --

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:44.289
We have.

00:28:44.355 --> 00:28:46.257
You know a stickler for time

00:28:46.324 --> 00:28:46.891
restaurants president I which I

00:28:46.958 --> 00:28:48.293
keep these things going right --

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:50.161
So I wanna make sure we get to

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:52.230
our second panel but just

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:54.032
perhaps of a couple of points

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:57.936
and I appreciate it --

00:28:58.002 --> 00:29:00.338
Michael's comments about almost

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:01.940
as babies slightly disconnected

00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:02.574
from the discussion today about

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.342
working and middle class housing

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:05.043
but I want to just be very clear

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.444
I think they're very much

00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:07.946
connected and that our inability

00:29:08.012 --> 00:29:08.213
to build.

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:10.381
Middle income housing is pushing --

00:29:10.448 --> 00:29:12.283
Folks up full time jobs into

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.052
units of adorably be occupied by

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:15.987
folks with far more modest means

00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:16.721
and means of those units are now --

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:18.456
Pushing almost people out on the

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:20.158
streets right this is

00:29:20.225 --> 00:29:22.127
dysfunctional housing economy

00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:22.527
that we have --

00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:24.095
That's you know meant most

00:29:24.162 --> 00:29:24.696
obviously manifested by are

00:29:24.762 --> 00:29:26.397
homeless but also speaking to

00:29:26.464 --> 00:29:28.266
what Michael mentioned about

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:30.001
families doubling tripling up

00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:32.403
and you know young adults dean

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.005
in a roommate situation much

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:36.407
being played out across our

00:29:36.474 --> 00:29:38.276
community are I think seen and

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:38.810
unseen every single day.

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:40.278
And so I do appreciate the

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:42.013
inclusion of the discussion of

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:42.514
homelessness and today's

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.215
conversation is very focused on

00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:46.117
a higher economic class --

00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:46.784
But a very much related all of

00:29:46.851 --> 00:29:48.553
us are tied up into this housing

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.221
crisis and all of us have a role

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:52.090
to play in fixing it.

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:54.092
Up if if I can't --

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:56.060
Just a couple questions for Doug

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:56.661
with your on the proposal's

00:29:56.728 --> 00:29:58.363
these are great slides I think

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:00.031
of vision of what the future may

00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:00.331
look like.

00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:00.932
In a world where we need to

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:02.500
build a second amount more

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:04.469
housing at a lower cost --

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:06.204
Where you at a with --

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:08.339
This particular project in terms

00:30:08.406 --> 00:30:10.074
of the the development process

00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:10.375
sure -- We

00:30:10.441 --> 00:30:12.210
are -- We're

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:14.412
almost entirely there were there

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:16.080
designed were anticipating

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:16.614
submitting to the city for

00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:18.349
building permits and a couple

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:22.153
weeks --

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.522
Which for their container type

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:26.191
projects --

00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:26.624
The city approval.

00:30:26.691 --> 00:30:28.526
Is pretty much just the

00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:32.130
foundation site plan utilities.

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:32.664
And the the whole modular

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.534
portion of the building is state

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:38.436
approval so Senate discretionary

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:40.438
review by the city council no

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:42.040
playing video.

00:30:42.106 --> 00:30:42.574
We're not asking for any

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.144
variances in it's just pretty

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:46.711
much a straight a building

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:46.945
permit.

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.479
So for Californians it think

00:30:48.546 --> 00:30:50.081
that this is somewhat exotic

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:50.715
this completely fits within a

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:52.483
lot of the code and is a fairly

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.352
normal that's kind of our model

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:58.056
is our our entitlement process.

00:30:58.122 --> 00:31:00.091
If this had to go through DST

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:02.327
and and and the building

00:31:02.393 --> 00:31:04.295
department this is a six month

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.030
ordeal --

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:08.066
Because the billing department.

00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:10.134
And then it it will still go

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.970
through DST but we've already.

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:12.537
Submitted for a preliminary

00:31:12.604 --> 00:31:14.172
approval through them.

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:16.207
And gotten very positive

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:20.044
feedback and they they frankly --

00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:21.946
Deferred a lot of their review

00:31:22.013 --> 00:31:22.480
to the housing commission

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:28.019
regarding the S. R. as but so --

00:31:28.086 --> 00:31:32.023
Or intent when for design --

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.657
But our entitlement time we're

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:36.261
estimating maximum the month

00:31:36.327 --> 00:31:37.996
month and a half while yeah.

00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:40.098
And then and then construction

00:31:40.164 --> 00:31:40.565
time on top of that.

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:44.035
Because of the containers one

00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:46.004
level is dropped in one day.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.437
So our our can total

00:31:46.504 --> 00:31:48.406
construction time for this

00:31:48.473 --> 00:31:52.076
project is probably four months.

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:54.078
Total while --

00:31:54.145 --> 00:31:56.180
But in the end you have to be it

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:56.781
I develop expert understand a

00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:58.082
quick.

00:31:58.149 --> 00:32:00.151
Right with all with all went.

00:32:00.218 --> 00:32:00.785
To that would take longer than

00:32:00.852 --> 00:32:02.186
that right yeah --

00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:04.289
In in I guess what's excited

00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:04.922
that that is there's we trying

00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:06.190
to grapple with the size and

00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:06.858
scale this particular problem.

00:32:06.924 --> 00:32:08.026
The need for innovation in the

00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:08.626
space pretty obvious in this

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:10.295
seems like innovative solution.

00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:12.163
But it does fit well within

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.797
existing regulatory environment

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:16.134
I mean yes you need it AB.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:16.701
Sixteen thirty seven five to

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:18.436
work in this space a little bit

00:32:18.503 --> 00:32:19.037
but on the whole the distal

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:20.371
existing develop a code supports

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:24.208
this development it does I mean

00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:26.144
are.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.778
We are are well within the to

00:32:26.844 --> 00:32:30.081
the the zoning code flora ratio

00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:32.116
it's after it center center so

00:32:32.183 --> 00:32:32.383
where are.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.985
You know.

00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:34.552
The end and being privately

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:36.087
financed also frankly is really

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:38.189
expedites process if we had to

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:40.291
apply for public funds and and

00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:42.093
wait around for that.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.262
It would it would kind of

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:44.662
Brecher model --

00:32:44.729 --> 00:32:47.965
Set is so the key to our problem

00:32:48.032 --> 00:32:50.001
as I said really is.

00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:50.535
Figuring out a way to get

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:52.603
permanent financing on the

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.005
project.

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:58.209
And committing to and affordable --

00:32:58.276 --> 00:33:02.280
Model got kind of an of perhaps

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:04.115
you the video at the live stream

00:33:04.182 --> 00:33:04.515
right now that.

00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:06.451
This is happening here but it

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:06.918
could happen in their

00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:07.285
communities --

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:08.286
To there are I think that

00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:10.421
there's and the couple projects

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:12.490
in LA and people are are are

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:14.125
kind of getting yeah.

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:16.194
I don't know if they are quite.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.363
Using the S. R. O. model that we

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:20.098
are.

00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:20.698
I guess our Ozer differently

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:22.266
defined India in every

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:24.068
municipality --

00:33:24.135 --> 00:33:27.939
So but yeah that the word is is

00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:29.941
getting out okay and then just

00:33:30.007 --> 00:33:30.575
there was the comment about --

00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:32.110
With reduction the Costa

00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:34.178
prevailing wages but the point

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:34.812
is is that you still prevailing

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:38.116
wages on the onsite work correct --

00:33:38.182 --> 00:33:38.750
We're not required to and and

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:42.286
less we take public subjects

00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:42.854
take some public substance

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.489
correct it if you did you what.

00:33:44.555 --> 00:33:46.023
If we did --

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.226
Are at the impact of prevailing

00:33:48.292 --> 00:33:50.261
wages to us is substantially

00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:55.967
reduced because most of the work --

00:33:56.033 --> 00:33:56.634
Is done in the factory with the

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:58.369
pre fab containers but the work

00:33:58.436 --> 00:33:59.036
that would be need to be done on

00:33:59.103 --> 00:34:00.371
site which would.

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:02.106
Fall under that.

00:34:02.173 --> 00:34:02.740
The yeah they've got the work

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:08.246
done Ste wage if if we if the

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:09.981
project were were preventing

00:34:10.047 --> 00:34:12.016
which brought understood.

00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:14.051
Exciting stuff appreciating is

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.685
to very quickly the network --

00:34:14.752 --> 00:34:16.187
Need to possibly on the next

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:16.454
panel --

00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:18.489
This yet you we did some good

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:22.126
work together I think. Sixteen

00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:22.660
thirty seven twenty three

00:34:22.727 --> 00:34:23.294
seventy two any ideas you know

00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:23.995
part of the the the deliverable

00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:24.662
from this hearing is intended to

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:27.965
be legislative concepts that we

00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:28.199
can --

00:34:28.266 --> 00:34:30.067
Introduced practice it is next

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:30.701
Monday I'll give us more time

00:34:30.768 --> 00:34:32.403
that but anything right now that

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.670
you can.

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:34.338
Maybe identifies areas that we

00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:36.340
should work on in the new

00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:38.075
legislative session.

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:40.378
Of the cans are roses making the

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:42.313
numbers work making the money

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:42.580
for that.

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:44.515
And I think is right to go to be

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:46.350
mixed income housing with

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:48.319
different Stratotanker homes.

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:50.288
And multifamily setting there

00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:52.123
will be huge making around the

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:58.029
system works --

00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:00.465
I think the everything that can

00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:01.966
be done to lower construction

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:04.168
cost chambers Mister home just

00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:06.170
mention it is wonderful.

00:35:06.237 --> 00:35:08.172
To but I think that if there's

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:10.107
gonna be a gap.

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:12.109
The problem now gap in money.

00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:14.145
There's a need to fill that gap

00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:16.481
and think mixed income where you

00:35:16.547 --> 00:35:18.115
get different income strat in

00:35:18.182 --> 00:35:20.017
the same property.

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:20.585
Is largely going to be a way

00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:24.288
that works out.

00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:26.491
Agree provide some form of

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:28.459
redevelopment and to provide you

00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:30.027
some state.

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:32.063
Investment in these projects --

00:35:32.129 --> 00:35:32.563
Remains be seen how we

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.265
necessarily fit better finance

00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:36.000
that the state has its own

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:36.334
budget -- To

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.069
but it is a lot of energy --

00:35:38.135 --> 00:35:38.669
In the assembly caucus to do

00:35:38.736 --> 00:35:40.137
that -- We

00:35:40.204 --> 00:35:42.073
had a bill this past session was

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:42.473
not successful --

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.442
But was a pulmonary attempted

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:46.177
this and I said I would welcome

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:48.012
eternity gentleman's input on

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:50.014
what that should look like in.

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:52.016
Twenty nineteen it's really the

00:35:52.083 --> 00:35:52.450
audiences well --

00:35:52.517 --> 00:35:54.418
I'd no doubt the bill be

00:35:54.485 --> 00:35:56.153
introduced and what form it what

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:56.787
details may be seen and making

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:58.489
sure that we eliminate the

00:35:58.556 --> 00:36:00.124
excesses of the past in the in

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:00.691
the abuses of the past.

00:36:00.758 --> 00:36:02.460
But really fine tuning honing in

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:04.629
so that homelessness but I think

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:08.032
also on middle income housing --

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:08.666
Would be is really what I to to

00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:10.301
try and influence to be involved

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:10.801
in this process so --

00:36:10.868 --> 00:36:12.136
To be continued.

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:14.005

At the table thank you guys so

much for being a position --

00:38:06.283 --> 00:38:06.851
We're gonna start off with low

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:08.085
about filing --

00:38:08.152 --> 00:38:10.021
From habitat for humanity low is

00:38:10.087 --> 00:38:10.688

See my side to ready to go.

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:22.266
On really glad to be talking

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:22.867
about the missing middle and

00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:24.468
thinking about all the efforts

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:25.102
that are going on and they know

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:27.972
that housing.

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:29.974
Just just to give some a

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:31.942
conversation to the public into

00:38:32.009 --> 00:38:32.543
the elected officials that we

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:34.445
need housing and it's okay to

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:34.845
vote for housing.

00:38:34.912 --> 00:38:36.280
It's difficult to do that.

00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:38.482
I'm also again again let Rick

00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:44.221
and you said about of Sam Neill

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:46.157
wouldn't the cost of housing is

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:46.757
so high that the missing the

00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:48.159
middle or taking up the low

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:48.526
income housing.

00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:50.361
It when I'm trying to build

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:52.163
housing for low income families

00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:52.797
and I go to a rotary club and

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:54.432
I'm trying to you know Chen up

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:56.200
so many for low income housing

00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:56.834
and you're looking at a whole

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:58.002
aye audience.

00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.636
Of people can't afford a house

00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:00.504
themselves as hard to get at

00:39:00.571 --> 00:39:02.440
expand the supply for low income

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:04.008
housing.

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:04.542
Is gets more difficult.

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:06.343
So I just wanted to share a

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:06.877
little bit about what hand

00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:10.314
habitat does and we build new

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:12.283
homes we partner with families.

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:14.051
That are --

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:15.986
We partner with families to help

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:17.988
they will help build their own

00:39:18.055 --> 00:39:20.057
home we build with volunteers

00:39:20.124 --> 00:39:20.758
and we partner with city so it

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:22.693
takes a lot of effort to bring --

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:28.032
House together and we sell the

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:30.501
this is an example some people

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:32.369
of asked when you build with

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:32.970
volunteers what does the house

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.038
look like.

00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:36.173
It looks like a very nice house

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:36.807
like any housing when with that

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:38.442
went to live in and they're

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:40.177
pretty proud to be able to help

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:42.213
both at home and to be able.

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:44.215
To afford that home at the 30% a

00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:44.849
level so I have a couple of

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:46.484
examples and if you start at the

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.085
bottom.

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:50.121
Of this is a families income in

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:53.090
at your fifty thousand dollars

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:54.325
at 30% they have twelve hundred

00:39:54.391 --> 00:39:56.260
dollars available for their a

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:56.627
housing costs.

00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:58.429
You have to add the mortgage

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.231
taxes insurance an H. away so

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:02.399
that's the twelve hundred and

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:03.033
seventy one so we will tell the

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.401
home to the family.

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:06.370
At to their first mortgage would

00:40:06.437 --> 00:40:08.272
be two hundred and nineteen

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:08.873
thousand dollars habitat would

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:10.407
end up with a silent second I

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:12.209
would look for down payment

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:12.810
assistance wherever we can.

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:14.411
Fortunately for one project the

00:40:14.478 --> 00:40:16.380
housing commission is providing

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:18.349
I'm some have died down payment

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:18.916
assistance really appreciate

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:20.651
that a great deal so they're not

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:22.553
family will be in that home for

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.488
two hundred and twenty thousand

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:24.755
dollars.

00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:26.724
At the home itself cost us four

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:30.127
hundred thousand dollars so it's

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:32.029
a lot of fund raising fifty than.

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:32.463
This is another --

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.198
Another family --

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:34.799
Just is similar Levin hundred

00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:38.002
dollars is available for housing

00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:38.669
they would have a mortgage once

00:40:38.736 --> 00:40:40.571
again we just divide their hot

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:42.206
income.

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:48.412
By 30% to figure out what

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:52.016
they're housing cost so a ten am

00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:54.018
very beneficial to the families

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:54.618
because that's where they can

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:55.019
build wealth --

00:40:55.085 --> 00:41:05.396
We want them to be a part of the

00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:06.197
community they become part of

00:41:06.263 --> 00:41:08.465
the fabric of the community they

00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:10.334
also need. For that --

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:12.002
Bill there up.

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:14.104
Yeah.

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:14.738
Hundred ninety two thousand that

00:41:14.805 --> 00:41:15.206
they pay to habitat.

00:41:15.272 --> 00:41:16.140
This last family is a moderate

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:18.375
and in a middle income family so

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:18.876
when you think about the

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:20.444
opportunity to provide for that

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:20.878
missing middle --

00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:22.213
What kind of subsidy would it

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:22.780
take and in this particular

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:24.148
project we have a --

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:26.317
The land was provided to us at a

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:28.152
very low cost so then our

00:41:28.219 --> 00:41:30.087
housing costs are about four

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:30.688
hundred thousand makes it so

00:41:30.754 --> 00:41:32.289
that this family can afford

00:41:32.356 --> 00:41:34.124
their entire mortgage.

00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:36.160
In there's no subsidy --

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:38.229
In that sense except for the 0%

00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:38.495
mortgage.

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:40.231
So they're they're at their

00:41:40.297 --> 00:41:42.066
monthly amount available for

00:41:42.132 --> 00:41:44.168
housing nineteen hundred and

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:46.136
seventy four you get the markets

00:41:46.203 --> 00:41:48.105
taxes insurance an H. away.

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:48.739
In there that says that still a

00:41:48.806 --> 00:41:52.309
good example of what we could

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:56.146
provide --

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:56.847
And a backup when we think about

00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:58.415
what you need for future --

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:00.451
Legislation you've talked about --

00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:02.519
Redevelopment as an opportunity

00:42:02.586 --> 00:42:04.355
where also looking at sequel

00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:06.290
reform habitat in California

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:08.025
just got --

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:10.361
So resolve the and frivolous

00:42:10.427 --> 00:42:12.329
lawsuit a sequel lawsuit it held

00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:14.265
the project up for two and a

00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:16.166
half years a neighbor that.

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:20.237
Protested the project Acosta to

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:22.106
pay for that --

00:42:22.172 --> 00:42:24.174
Or fund raise for it that

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:24.575
habitat did in.

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.377
That particular habitat dead so

00:42:26.443 --> 00:42:28.345
sequel reform is very important

00:42:28.412 --> 00:42:30.180
also -- So

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:32.116
when we think about this a

00:42:32.182 --> 00:42:32.783
surplus land that the state of

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:36.120
California has or cities have we

00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:38.322
need some clarification on that.

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.391
Because which I think the rules

00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:40.991
are you supposed to get the

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.526
highest and best price but if we

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.295
really need a willing at

00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:46.330
affordable housing middle income

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:48.098
housing low income housing.

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:48.666
And maybe state could think

00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:50.434
about transferring that land to

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:52.469
a land trashed making it

00:42:52.536 --> 00:42:54.204
permanently available for

00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:56.140
affordable housing --

00:42:56.206 --> 00:42:58.142
In in a lot of different ways so

00:42:58.208 --> 00:42:58.809
that would be one way that would

00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:00.244
help and also I think there's

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:02.313
some clarification for special

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:02.947
districts because of the water

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:04.148
district owns it.

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:06.183
They don't really wanna make it.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:06.784
They don't want to lose that

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.485
asset to the from the repair so

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:10.387
I think there's some

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:10.955
conversation ask to go along

00:43:11.021 --> 00:43:12.156
with that.

00:43:12.222 --> 00:43:14.491
And also developer impact fees --

00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:16.293
Are they proportionate for the

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.662
cost of the home and what we're

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:18.929
building.

00:43:18.996 --> 00:43:24.234
So just a couple of ideas for

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:26.136
the middle income aspect of this.

00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:26.603
Thank you Laurie --

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:28.439
I think Jim is next up on are

00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:30.240
advertised agenda okay.

00:43:30.307 --> 00:43:34.244
Thank you very much and I and

00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:34.845
kills member of being tied to

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:38.449
the same thing on behalf of the

00:43:38.515 --> 00:43:39.984
local economic development.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.353
Corporation EDC is a recently

00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:45.956
adopted a very visionary program

00:43:46.023 --> 00:43:46.490
called inclusive economic

00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:48.225
development and it's quite

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:50.127
exciting when.

00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:51.962
You add the word inclusive and

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:52.463
from the words economic

00:43:52.529 --> 00:43:53.998
development.

00:43:54.064 --> 00:43:56.166
And one of the tears of that is

00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:56.767
affordability and obviously a

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:58.535
huge part of affordability is

00:43:58.602 --> 00:44:00.537
housing. One of the things that

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:04.141
we're trying to do is to develop

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.210
better data sets so that instead

00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:08.012
of people just talking in a

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:08.278
totally.

00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:10.280
Were talking through their own

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:12.282
biases we use data one of the

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:14.051
studies that we're working on

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:16.420
now is to develop a good data on

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.288
the various layers of income

00:44:18.355 --> 00:44:20.324
strategy in the community.

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:22.292
We're trying to match that with

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:24.428
building permits and housing to

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.230
graphically show what we all

00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:28.132
intuitively know.

00:44:28.198 --> 00:44:30.100
And that is that there's a big

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:30.734
hole in the middle but we want

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:41.445
to use the data for that.

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:44.081
There's a there's another

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:44.715
fundamental point of lead into

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:46.183
my ideas for legislative action

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:48.118
costs to a project.

00:44:48.185 --> 00:44:50.387
Assuming incomes art level then

00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:50.988
the number of people that can

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:54.091
qualify necessarily goes down

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:58.162
the cost of a certain percent of

00:44:58.228 --> 00:45:00.464
your consumers of your market.

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:02.299
Cannot afford to buy the

00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:04.301
property or cannot afford to

00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:06.003
rent the property.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.172
And we want again be able to

00:45:08.238 --> 00:45:08.539
quantify that.

00:45:08.605 --> 00:45:10.374
And all all of our use an

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.409
example of one that that a lot

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.478
of people have said to us in

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:16.413
this is not send the political

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.148
context and not even said from

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:20.017
an agenda point of view.

00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:20.651
They deeply believe from their

00:45:20.717 --> 00:45:22.286
analysis of the numbers.

00:45:22.352 --> 00:45:24.088
That the city of San Diego

00:45:24.154 --> 00:45:26.223
increases its inclusionary

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:28.025
housing level.

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:30.294
From 10220% and if it goes to a

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:34.131
prevailing wage standard nothing

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:34.498
will be built.

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:36.300
It won't not be built because

00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:36.934
people are angry and take their

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.435
marbles and go home it will not

00:45:38.502 --> 00:45:40.037
be built.

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:42.172
Because the numbers will not

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:44.007
work and you're gonna have even

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:46.176
a bigger gap between the

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:48.078
affordable that a subsidized and

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:48.712
the market that to some extent

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:50.380
immune from these things.

00:45:50.447 --> 00:45:52.382
And again those things have to

00:45:52.449 --> 00:45:54.084
be done with data and that's

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:54.718
complicated in walls a lot of

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:56.120
issues.

00:45:56.186 --> 00:45:58.021
And we just talk about some

00:45:58.088 --> 00:45:58.655
things and somebody's there are

00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:00.457
a lot of it's funny very similar

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:00.724
worries.

00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:04.094
But in our community tied the

00:46:04.161 --> 00:46:04.661
water quality control board

00:46:04.728 --> 00:46:06.396
storm water management

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:10.167
requirements that they imposed --

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:14.004
My adjective arrogantly.

00:46:14.071 --> 00:46:16.373
My age if but today imposed

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:16.707
having have.

00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:18.375
Dramatically impacted our

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:20.177
ability to do.

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:22.179
Housing in San Diego and I'm not

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:24.181
talking about green field here

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:24.748
that's different even a big

00:46:24.815 --> 00:46:26.250
project you're designing from

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:26.884
scratch you can build a lot of

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.218
systems and so I'm.

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:28.819
Specifically talking about in

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:34.158
cell the legislature does have

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:37.995
the authority. To go in and and

00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:38.562
legislative around a water

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:41.999
quality control board mandate

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:42.566
those numbers are twenty to

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:44.034
forty thousand dollars I

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:46.003
personally was trying to do some

00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:48.071
infill projects very simple

00:46:48.138 --> 00:46:48.472
infill projects.

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:50.307
And I happen to get caught in

00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:52.242
the switches windy when those

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:54.044
laws came into effect.

00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:56.113
The water quality control board

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:56.713
does not tell the city's what

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.048
they have to do.

00:46:58.115 --> 00:47:00.450
But they tell the city so that

00:47:00.517 --> 00:47:02.019
they don't do what the water

00:47:02.085 --> 00:47:02.653
quality control board wants him

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:06.323
to do the board will find them.

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.091
So the city's naturally take a

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:10.027
belt and suspenders approach and

00:47:10.093 --> 00:47:10.627
I would say I personally got

00:47:10.694 --> 00:47:12.462
clobbered because no one knew

00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:14.298
what to do so I would urge the

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:16.300
legislature and I know that's

00:47:16.366 --> 00:47:16.600
not easy.

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:18.502
It's consultant people talk

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:20.237
about water quality but again

00:47:20.304 --> 00:47:22.039
infill if you think about in

00:47:22.105 --> 00:47:22.573
filament shark in mature

00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:24.174
communities.

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:26.310
It's it's such a small thing.

00:47:26.376 --> 00:47:28.078
Arm.

00:47:28.145 --> 00:47:30.347
The CC date again I'm nomina for

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:32.282
likely to exceed eagle had I am

00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.849
a passionate advocate for

00:47:32.916 --> 00:47:34.017
renewable energy.

00:47:34.084 --> 00:47:36.119
But the C. E. C. mandate for all

00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:38.355
housing in California to have

00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:40.424
solar after these two thousand

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:42.192
twenty or maybe beginning in.

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:44.127
Two thousand twenty is it is a

00:47:44.194 --> 00:47:46.029
financial disaster.

00:47:46.096 --> 00:47:46.563
It's going to add twenty

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.332
thousand dollars at least of the

00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:50.334
cost of each year a single

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:50.734
family residence.

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:54.371
Now into McAllister said well

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:58.075
but you'll get that in savings

00:47:58.141 --> 00:48:00.077
that's mathematically incorrect

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:02.112
it presupposes a certain level

00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:02.746
of utility consumption and most

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:04.114
people don't have.

00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:06.083
So I would --

00:48:06.149 --> 00:48:08.118
Eight in the match and thanks to

00:48:08.185 --> 00:48:08.785
won't give you credit for that

00:48:08.852 --> 00:48:10.053
so when they're under writing

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.289
helping alone you can get into

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:13.957
warriors ratios.

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:14.558
Trust me they're not going to

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:14.825
say -- G.

00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:16.526
Jim's utility bill went down

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:17.094
four dollars a month so I'm

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.195
gonna capitalize that increases

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:20.163
mortgage.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.032
So that's a pure cost that will

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:26.003
again every cost shrinks the the

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.536
number of people that --

00:48:26.603 --> 00:48:28.305
They can qualify for a given

00:48:28.372 --> 00:48:28.605
product --

00:48:28.672 --> 00:48:30.507
Laurie mentioned seek reform I

00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:36.146
and it's incredibly complicated.

00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:38.348
The the the lawsuits that the

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:40.284
tactical lawsuits are what

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:40.884
upsets people it isn't being

00:48:40.951 --> 00:48:42.085
environmentally conscious it's

00:48:42.152 --> 00:48:42.786
it's just being is being used as

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:44.021
a weapon.

00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:44.554
If you could just add an

00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:46.089
attorney prevailing party

00:48:46.156 --> 00:48:48.292
attorneys fees costs. To the

00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:50.294
sequel so that people have to

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:50.794
think seriously and I I

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:52.329
understand the social argued

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:54.231
against that for people that

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:56.099
don't have that capacity but

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:56.733
it's got to be carefully thought

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.201
of but something that simple

00:48:58.268 --> 00:48:58.602
will would have.

00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:11.682
Kept that neighbor from doing

00:49:11.748 --> 00:49:12.749
what they did to you and you

00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:16.086
wouldn't have that expense --

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:19.923
Doing infill site small projects

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.092
if we if and if you have full

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:22.759
lots are less you don't have to

00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:26.063
go through the some.

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:28.465
Map actively for the three birds

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:30.033
in the feel like a leasing là

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:30.667
maybe you take that for making

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:31.234
eight I don't know what the

00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:32.135
number is.

00:49:32.202 --> 00:49:32.803
Which you increase that number

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:33.403
soul larger percent of your

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:36.173
properties can be done at our at

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:38.275
at without going to the

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:38.875
subdivision map act and what

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:42.012
that would do it within the

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:44.147
zoning within the community.

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:44.781
If I I I was involved the piece

00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:46.049
of property that the prior owner

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:48.018
subdivided into four lights it

00:49:48.085 --> 00:49:48.685
was a huge in for it should have

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:48.885
been.

00:49:48.952 --> 00:49:50.387
Eight within the community

00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:51.054
standards it was for why because

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:52.255
it was easier so there's four

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:54.424
lots off the off the inventory

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:56.526
so just a little thing like that.

00:49:56.593 --> 00:49:57.227
From then some other things that

00:49:57.294 --> 00:49:58.395
apply probably not so much at

00:49:58.462 --> 00:50:00.530
the state level but I think no

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:02.099
cities it.

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:04.468
Is off the charts again I was

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:08.171
there. One city just in my

00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:08.905
opinion extorted me on that were

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:10.574
as good city Chula Vista allows

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:22.285
you just sign something that

00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:24.087
runs with the land it's as if

00:50:24.154 --> 00:50:25.956
the street is ever expanded.

00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:26.456
You will test you will

00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:28.125
consistency.

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:31.962
The provide the second be anyway.

00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:32.596
So that would be one the other

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:34.131
thing is incremental under

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:35.966
grounding of utilities.

00:50:36.032 --> 00:50:38.268
It's it it's probably ten X. two

00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:40.036
underground a half a block than

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:40.637
it is to underground a mile.

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:42.272
Of utilities if we believe is a

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:42.906
people the underground electric

00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:44.374
utilities is a good public

00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:44.641
outcome.

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.343
The net should be a C. P. you

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.445
see imposed three that applies

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:50.147
to all ratepayers is managed by

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:50.480
the utility.

00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:52.149
And if they do it scale.

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:52.783
And you don't impose that on

00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.351
individual property owner

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:54.985
because it it does just one

00:50:55.051 --> 00:50:56.386
infill in particular just turn

00:50:56.453 --> 00:51:00.123
your numbers upside down I was

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.824
Limón girls. Six houses we want

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:04.060
to bring them all in under four

00:51:04.127 --> 00:51:04.694
hundred fifty thousand dollars.

00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:05.962
The combination of the

00:51:06.029 --> 00:51:08.231
underground and cost and the and

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:12.269
the half wood street

00:51:12.335 --> 00:51:14.171
improvements and I and now it

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:16.206
will permanently forever never

00:51:16.273 --> 00:51:18.241
be one house and said a six and

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:20.310
I I know enough about this

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:20.911
community to know there are.

00:51:20.977 --> 00:51:22.312
Thousands and thousands maybe

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:24.147
tens of thousands of units

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:26.016
locked up through these little.

00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:28.385
Of policies that I would

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:30.153
certainly like to Laurie

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:30.654
mentioned the deaths.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.522
I mean the the the development

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:33.990
impact fees the traffic impact

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:36.026
fees or or out of control again

00:51:36.092 --> 00:51:38.128
I don't think it's the state but

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:40.297
I would like. To to to say you

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:40.831
cannot collect the fee for

00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:42.299
anything you don't plan to build

00:51:42.365 --> 00:51:54.611
in ten years.

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:55.078
Make it very finite.

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:57.914
Because again I was in a project

00:51:57.981 --> 00:52:00.150
right to pay fees for road and

00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:01.985
managed they had scheduled for

00:52:02.052 --> 00:52:02.552
two thousand and two thirds

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:04.120
Ritesh.

00:52:04.187 --> 00:52:04.754
SO you get if you don't within

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.256
ten years you can't charge me

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:08.058
the death now I take some

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:08.725
administrative work but once the

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:10.093
systems up and running I think I

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:10.727
think that would take care of

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:12.128
itself and I would make it.

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:14.130
In not take any Jean a money out

00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:16.066
of defines for any purpose when

00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:16.666
you build the project can you

00:52:16.733 --> 00:52:18.001
maybe do 5%.

00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:20.070
So those are just a few ideas

00:52:20.136 --> 00:52:22.239
that I think and can.

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:22.906
In a lot of a conserve personal

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:24.307
experience autumn comes from

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:24.674
work I've done.

00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:26.076
In the public and the private

00:52:26.142 --> 00:52:26.343
sector --

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:28.211
Then I I think with their a lot

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:28.845
of people believe me that want

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:30.113
to build middle income housing

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:30.514
in our community.

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.315
There's property there it's

00:52:32.382 --> 00:52:32.983
already zone it is ready to go

00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:34.451
and the the series of little

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:35.986
things incrementally

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:38.054
grammatically incrementally add

00:52:38.121 --> 00:52:42.158
up make the projects impossible.

00:52:42.225 --> 00:52:44.461
Great Jim thank you very much

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:45.061
and good ideas and there are

00:52:45.128 --> 00:52:46.630
last on this panel is popping up

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:50.033
that Dr Sir the floor is yours.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.037
Thank you very much.

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:54.604
Jennifer you gonna cheat up

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:54.905
[inaudible]

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:59.910
Coming --

00:52:59.976 --> 00:53:02.312
Just before the see my power

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:06.283
point work down here work years

00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:11.955
working fine right.

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:12.489
What are they while we're

00:53:12.556 --> 00:53:14.257
waiting I just want to say that?

00:53:14.324 --> 00:53:16.192
I'd I'd none of my projects from

00:53:16.259 --> 00:53:16.826
the city of asking of the city

00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:18.228
of San Diego but the city San

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:20.130
Diego probably as for all the

00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:20.764
criticism against prop is the

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.198
best reputation of any city in

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:23.967
the county.

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:24.601
In terms of trying to work to

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:27.103
get make things happen so thanks

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:30.073
guys.

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.008
Good afternoon and thank you for

00:53:32.075 --> 00:53:32.542
coming out for the public

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:34.010
hearing this afternoon --

00:53:34.077 --> 00:53:36.313
We have a high housing crisis

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:38.548
and that's why we're all here.

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:39.182
But more importantly we have a

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:42.352
another car the housing that no

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:42.953
one's really talking about.

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:46.122
And and so as a member of the

00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:46.723
two hundred I'm here to talk

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:50.026
about the home ownership crisis.

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:50.594
Others a lot of talk about

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.195
affordable housing which is

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:54.197
needed but there's also need to

00:53:54.264 --> 00:53:56.066
have more homeowners

00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:56.733
particularly for people with the

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.535
of middle income us hours a lot

00:53:58.602 --> 00:54:00.370
of working class individuals.

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:02.038
So that's going to be the nature

00:54:02.105 --> 00:54:04.074
of my presentation I want to

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:04.741
build on some of the ideas that

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:06.576
Laurie and then Jim have talked

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:08.078
about.

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:10.413
They're they're the experts in

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.047
the field there their builders

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:12.215
and and so --

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:14.284
More de ideas I'm gonna be

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:16.319
discussing is is all of the more

00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:18.088
concept.

00:54:18.154 --> 00:54:20.156
So at the table back here is is

00:54:20.223 --> 00:54:22.225
a copy this of of of my

00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:24.361
presentation there's gonna be a

00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:24.794
number of graphs.

00:54:24.861 --> 00:54:26.529
Not you know I don't know if you

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:27.197
can see those numbers very well

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:29.966
but if you want more detail.

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:30.600
There are they'll be there in

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:32.068
the back.

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:34.371
So the the the problem from my

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:36.272
perspective is that there is a

00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:40.210
tremendous wealth gap between of

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:40.744
white and and and ethnic

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.245
minorities and it was

00:54:42.312 --> 00:54:44.214
exacerbated during the Great

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:44.514
Recession.

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.316
And so this is a a charter was

00:54:46.383 --> 00:54:52.155
put together by the by the pew.

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:56.226
Institute and in thirteen of the

00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:58.228
the the wealth gap between

00:54:58.294 --> 00:55:00.530
blacks and whites was --

00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:04.034
Thirteen times the at the white --

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:04.668
Of wealth was to thirteen times

00:55:04.734 --> 00:55:06.503
more than blacks and then ten

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:08.405
times for them of Latinos or

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:08.705
Hispanics.

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:10.573
And and and that's a problem

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.409
that maybe has improved just

00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:12.709
from -- We

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:18.048
bet but probably not enough.

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:20.016
And and and homeownership can

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:20.483
can address that --

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:22.118
Wealth gap --

00:55:22.185 --> 00:55:22.485
Going forward.

00:55:22.552 --> 00:55:24.154
This is a of some information up --

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:28.024
On data from the federal home --

00:55:28.091 --> 00:55:28.658
So station on loans and you can

00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:34.197
see that over from. Nineteen

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:34.798
thirty four to nineteen sixty

00:55:34.864 --> 00:55:36.266
two the differences in terms of

00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:38.101
the the the the the value of

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:40.070
real estate loans made to whites

00:55:40.136 --> 00:55:40.737
versus blacks in this particular

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.205
case.

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:46.176
Just a big big big difference

00:55:46.242 --> 00:55:48.311
and then over to right you can

00:55:48.378 --> 00:55:50.313
see the big difference in terms

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:50.914
of the the investment that.

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.248
Both communities have earned

00:55:52.315 --> 00:55:54.150
during that same period.

00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:56.252
Very big difference and so then

00:55:56.319 --> 00:55:58.755
if you take those.

00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:00.757
hand side you have both real

00:56:00.824 --> 00:56:02.225
estate and investment value for

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:04.327
whites which is now.

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:06.329
A five trillion dollars during

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:08.131
this period of time I'm sure

00:56:08.198 --> 00:56:08.498
it's gone up.

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:10.300
Another five trillion dollars of

00:56:10.366 --> 00:56:12.235
thanks to the of the 1%.

00:56:12.302 --> 00:56:14.537
Of it but then in the right you

00:56:14.604 --> 00:56:16.473
have that of the ethnic

00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:18.108
minorities ethnic minorities

00:56:18.174 --> 00:56:20.110
from those.

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:20.777
For those two charts right there

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:24.013
represents less than 2%.

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:26.349
Of of of what the White real

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:28.084
estate values and investments

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:32.155
have been during that that

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:32.522
period of time.

00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:34.290
So if -- If

00:56:34.357 --> 00:56:36.159
you want to read more about of

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:36.726
the discrimination that is

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:38.528
taking place over the years this

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:40.196
is an excellent book.

00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:40.797
There's a lot of stories in

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:42.565
there to it it's just going to

00:56:42.632 --> 00:56:44.300
blow your mind you know you you

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:48.271
you you it highlights how of red

00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:48.838
line you know I I thought.

00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:50.640
That that that the banks were

00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:52.342
responsible for red light that's

00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:54.611
the federal government they came

00:56:54.677 --> 00:56:55.211
up with that they they they

00:56:55.278 --> 00:56:56.613
wrote memos so how to redline

00:56:56.679 --> 00:56:58.414
communities and then.

00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:04.053
Of course everybody else --

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.156
Waldron so excellent book right

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:06.489
now -- This

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:08.558
is provided by the California

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:10.393
association of realtors and and

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.529
the idea behind this chart is to

00:57:12.595 --> 00:57:16.366
this to this to determine.

00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:17.000
Whether the the various ethnic

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:20.403
groups are buying at at the at

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:24.240
that their at at the there pro

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:26.042
rata share of the population so

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:28.645
everybody if every household up

00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:30.113
there.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:32.282
By ethnicity was buying --

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:34.250
One one home for houses out

00:57:34.317 --> 00:57:36.219
there it would be at zero so

00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:38.288
what you have on the on the on

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:40.156
the on the very top is at

00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:42.158
roughly --

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:46.129
Whites are buying --

00:57:46.196 --> 00:57:48.498
17% more than the than their

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:50.466
their parity and and the courts

00:57:50.533 --> 00:57:54.170
deadly the Hispanics which is

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:54.704
down below they're they're

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:58.007
they're buying about 17% less

00:57:58.074 --> 00:57:58.608
than their parents or another

00:57:58.675 --> 00:57:58.842
words.

00:57:58.908 --> 00:58:00.476
The way they did the math and

00:58:00.543 --> 00:58:04.247
this one is that in two thousand

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:06.216
fourteen of Hispanic households

00:58:06.282 --> 00:58:08.284
was about 38% --

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:10.687
Of of California and then when

00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:14.324
you take a look at the when you

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.891
take a look at the hot tub

00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:18.261
household ownership it's 22% so.

00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:20.330
Twenty two from thirty eight to

00:58:20.396 --> 00:58:24.067
seventeen so a still a lot of

00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:24.434
disparity that.

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.469
So there's a number of factors

00:58:26.536 --> 00:58:28.438
that the going to why --

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:30.273
We have this housing crisis can

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.275
blame it on line cost labor

00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:32.508
costs.

00:58:32.575 --> 00:58:36.145
Over regulation sequel for sure --

00:58:36.212 --> 00:58:38.214
You know everyone blames it on

00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:38.815
greedy developers but the fact

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:40.183
is.

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.552
Is it it's this supply in if you

00:58:42.619 --> 00:58:44.220
were to ask of of former

00:58:44.287 --> 00:58:46.456
president Bill Clinton he would

00:58:46.522 --> 00:58:48.024
probably say.

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:50.493
He would policy it's the supply

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.128
stupid.

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:52.395
And so --

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:53.029
And they're a lot of contribute

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:56.132
a reason why.

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:58.167
So in California.

00:58:58.234 --> 00:59:02.071
We have here of as of two

00:59:02.138 --> 00:59:02.672
thousand can't read that over

00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:06.109
there are.

00:59:06.175 --> 00:59:06.743
Two thousand seventeen eighteen

00:59:06.809 --> 00:59:06.910
up.

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:08.411
Of the number of homes built

00:59:08.478 --> 00:59:10.280
versus multi family so over here

00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:12.448
in in about nineteen eighty six

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:12.749
of those --

00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:14.450
Disproportion number of of

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:16.486
apartment was the result of a

00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:18.087
lot of federal --

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:20.523
Incentives that were provided to

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:22.458
developers then they lost some

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:24.127
so then they stop building as

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:26.162
many apartments then in about

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:26.796
ninety in the nineteen nineties

00:59:26.863 --> 00:59:28.197
it was a big real estate

00:59:28.264 --> 00:59:30.133
recession recession as well but

00:59:30.199 --> 00:59:30.366
really.

00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:30.900
Really big of real estate

00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:34.137
recession and then again at two

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:34.637
thousand seven it's the

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:36.205
beginning of the Great Recession

00:59:36.272 --> 00:59:36.839
and so we're not just getting

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:40.143
out about.

00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:42.011
Soul the far right.

00:59:42.078 --> 00:59:44.113
They're projecting that to just

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.416
to stay at at equilibrate you

00:59:46.482 --> 00:59:50.086
need to build a hundred eighty a

00:59:50.153 --> 01:00:04.634
thousand homes here but that.

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:08.171
So quickly --

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:10.206
County the most under bill

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:10.440
county.

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:21.317
And take a look at how job this

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:21.851
person's housing permits.

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:22.485
Of so the problem is the good

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:23.086
news is a lot of jobs the bad

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:24.020
news is there's no housing and

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:24.487
therefore goes up.

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:28.124
So down payment.

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:29.959
When it was?

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:32.161
But now was the housing finance

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:32.762
agency has a program that can

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:33.262
provide of down payment

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:36.366
assistance what can San Diego

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:38.067
county.

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:42.105
I think that number is --

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:44.273
Less than a hundred fifty seven

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.942
thousand roughly so --

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:46.509
There is a lot of assistance

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:48.478
there so pretty much you can get

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:52.048
both the down payment and any

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:52.548
mortgage from from --

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:56.152
Cal of housing finance agency to

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:58.221
to buy a home at about seven

01:00:58.287 --> 01:00:58.888
hundred thousand and that number

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:00.390
and and that they're going to

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:02.158
increase that limit --

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:04.160
Here beginning in January --

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:06.062
Lot of mortgages up there the

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:06.362
problem is.

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:08.031
You know.

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:10.166
The buyers you to be aware of of

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:12.402
the cell old mortgages that got

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.303
us in trouble. Ten years ago.

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.272
So.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:16.906
A lot of emphasis has been put

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:18.608
on affordable housing but there

01:01:18.674 --> 01:01:20.376
rentals and the problem with

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:22.178
rentals that you can never

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:22.645
building the wealth.

01:01:22.712 --> 01:01:24.213
And so --

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.182
What -- The

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:26.816
two hundred has been advocating

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.251
for more --

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:32.055
Home homeownership quickly.

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:34.123
You know --

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.757
The there was an opportunity a

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:36.492
years ago to do a lot more fix

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:38.061
and flip.

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:38.661
But those fix implicit were

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:40.063
being.

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:40.663
Converted to rentals now I'm

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.432
proposing to do fix and flips

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:44.333
and and and and and sold to

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.069
first time home buyers.

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:48.104
This is example of some of it

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:50.339
was an old a GM plant in east

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:50.606
Oakland.

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:52.275
Was converted into beautiful of

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:56.045
community there of this is

01:01:56.112 --> 01:02:00.116
another urban infill condos in

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:02.151
Sacramento but these.

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:04.087
Soul recently in the five point.

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:06.122
Five hundred thousand so --

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:08.257
That's the type of product ID

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:10.359
like to see available for the

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:10.893
for the middle income and

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.261
working class.

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:16.032
So there's a lot of local fixes --

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:27.243
Back back to be done --

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:30.413
And you can you can read more

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:30.913
about it if you pick up.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.115
Presentation --

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:36.352
So [inaudible] Five phone that

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:38.187
would enable us small lot

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:38.821
developers and other people but

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:40.523
they can they can buy these

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:40.756
homes.

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:42.391
Renovate them and then sell to

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.227
first time home buyers of is is

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:44.794
is the big idea behind this

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:46.195
right now --

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:48.164
So if you do this.

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:50.299
Of the whole community benefits

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:52.301
by that because there's a lot of

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:52.935
people that have the money but

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:54.470
that their to product it's just

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.305
not available we can't afford a

01:02:56.372 --> 01:02:56.706
million dollar.

01:02:56.772 --> 01:02:58.474
Home and at the same time they

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.343
can't afford to live in

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:02.078
affordable rental rentals

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:04.147
because they make more than 80%

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:04.647
of the median income.

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:06.282
So -- So the

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:08.417
the whole idea about getting

01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:10.620
people to homes it's it's going

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:12.321
to close the wealth gap you can

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:12.855
spend more time with the

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:14.056
families.

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:16.325
Of their of their of their of

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:18.027
their family budgets what are

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:18.594
not gonna be stretch because

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:22.331
right now we of their driving

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:24.066
you know.

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:26.235
Probably a hundred fifty miles a

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:26.435
day.

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:28.070
And that status for expensive.

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:30.139
So -- I'll

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:33.976
just leave it with that.

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:36.078
Thank you Robert of cash should

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:36.779
go back on the slides to the the

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:38.014
bar graph showing the the

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:38.681
housing production or lack there

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:40.082
of California.

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:42.218
Is as we do Q. and a and maybe

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:43.953
to lex person as a presentation

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.155
I think at least a graphically

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:46.756
illustrates the challenge that

01:03:46.822 --> 01:03:48.457
you it was here and try to get

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:50.426
them to understand the scale the

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.328
size of what we're discussing it

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:52.929
what we kind of need to hit.

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:54.030
Where we are today --

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:55.965
I think this is the slide that

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:56.566
when I've seen in the past I

01:03:56.632 --> 01:03:58.100
think just brings home for the

01:03:58.167 --> 01:03:58.634
average constituent we're

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.436
talking about and why every

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:01.070
neighborhood has to do its part

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.471
of the city must do its part --

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.407
Hopefully you all got from

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:05.975
organizing of this panel is a

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:06.309
more about --

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.244
Single family development or

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:08.778
sort of free standing --

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:10.379
Non makes non multi family

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:12.048
product --

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:12.515
As well as this --

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:14.317
What rob was getting out --

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:16.385
About homeownership and that you

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:18.054
know we talk a lot about the

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:18.721
rent but we also we don't always

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:20.256
talk it nearly as often about

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:33.336
people's ability to actually

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:33.936
transfer to being first time

01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:34.270
home buyers.

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:36.305
In developing the wealth that

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.107
really envisioned you stained.

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:40.109
A California for long haul right

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:43.913
as talk about you eight we

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.015
tested a lot in their education

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:46.315
[inaudible]

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:48.117
An attack.

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:51.954
Arizona of a nay and that's a

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:52.622
that's a huge minutes insult the

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:54.357
taxpayers who who help to do

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:56.058
that any kids want to stay right

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:56.692
but it gets to the central issue

01:04:56.759 --> 01:04:59.996
that you're.

01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:02.098
And so --

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:02.465
Toni Atkins --

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:04.200
When -- When

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.135
she was in the assembly did get

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:06.369
of -- So

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:08.371
much just station passed and she

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:10.139
did put to put in some money for

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:10.706
homeownership and then most

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:12.108
recently.

01:05:12.174 --> 01:05:15.978
I think it was with prop one or

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:18.314
prop to with the prop to whether

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:20.016
a veterans housing so.

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:20.683
The good news is all about money

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.418
a hundred and fifty million

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:24.220
dollars is going over --

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:24.820
To California housing finance

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:28.224
agency for this down payment

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:30.026
assistance program.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:32.328
They have the ability I'm not

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:34.063
sure how they do it --

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:35.998
There's somebody here staff

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:36.666
member you're you might tell us

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:38.267
how how they do it but they're

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:40.236
able to leverage it twenty seven

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:40.636
times so that.

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:42.138
Hundred through through private

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:42.705
sources funny so that one

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:46.008
hundred and fifty million is not

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:48.010
going to be --

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:50.046
A little over four billion.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:50.346
And so --

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:52.081
That's going to be able to

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:54.216
provide down payment assistance

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:54.750
to about fifteen thousand

01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:55.951
individuals.

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:58.554
So it's it's the it's a it's

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.122
it's a tremendous program and

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:00.756
more money is going to programs

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.124
like that.

01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:04.527
Thank you Bob wills we're hill

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:06.495
from college FAM in the next

01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:08.297
panel Lloyd thank you number one

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:08.931
for a knowledge in their lives

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:10.166
his here --

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:10.766
Housing matters I think it's

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:11.434
important have cheerleaders for

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.001
housing --

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:14.203
And and that's what the

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:14.837
organization does and hopefully

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:18.607
we can every can you do their

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:19.942
part -- You

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:20.576
mention a number of legislative

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:24.080
ideas when you mentioned that --

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:26.115
Animates me as surplus land --

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:26.682
Even with my own assembly

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:28.050
district the state has a

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:28.684
tremendous amount of land under

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:30.119
utilized --

01:06:30.186 --> 01:06:30.786
With zero intention of utilizing

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:32.855
any better --

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:34.824
my staff and exploring currently

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.225
on parcel specific --

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.527
Piece of land that it just

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:40.129
preview --

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:40.796
We've really old state building

01:06:40.863 --> 01:06:42.264
in two full city blocks in

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:42.832
downtown San Diego with zero

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:46.102
housing and wants to make a lot

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:46.469
of sense so --

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:48.571
They may see a bill from you

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:49.171
shortly to try and force the

01:06:49.238 --> 01:06:50.473
force to hand on that parcel.

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:52.241
Key talk more about that concept

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:52.842
that what you personally be

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:54.477
observing and what you think

01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:56.145
would be --

01:06:56.212 --> 01:06:56.612
Useful in a potential

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.247
legislative concept to to better

01:06:58.314 --> 01:07:00.149
utilize that publicly only.

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:02.084
So what I would have seen --

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:06.055
Land become available and hi

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:10.192
after and the land for so to

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:12.361
speak in order the housing on it

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:14.230
so -- It

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:16.098
there and it's not clear to the

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:16.732
agencies what they're supposed

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:18.534
to get or how they're supposed

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:20.302
to offer it at so some clarity

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:21.971
would be very helpful.

01:07:22.037 --> 01:07:22.371
Some so clarity --

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:24.140
Even a prioritization.

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:26.242
And priorities yeah so a very

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:28.010
ation of that --

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:30.279
Is where the the the public

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:32.381
agency does not sell the land

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:34.283
but makes it available gives the

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.252
developer a long term lease.

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:38.254
And on that long term lease they

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.222
can get financing then to build

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:42.358
condominiums a bill homes and so

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:44.260
what happens is then you have a

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:47.997
shared appreciation lease.

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:49.999
So -- So it.

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:50.633
By not having to pay for that

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.635
line up front the developer then

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:56.138
can the build.

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:56.806
The homes or or condos and then

01:07:56.872 --> 01:08:00.209
the public agency can get their

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:02.211
money back over time.

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:04.079
And that's a great concept that

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:05.915
almost promoted by.

01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:06.482
Low you may think you what

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.417
Laurie made mention of such a

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:10.453
copper special districts as an

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:11.086
right fast but I don't think I

01:08:11.153 --> 01:08:12.188
got what you're trying to say so.

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:14.356
So I one piece of land that

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:14.857
became available to us.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.425
That they put out was from a

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:18.327
water district and so we wanted

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:20.296
to after them zero for it and

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.198
they don't want except zero

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:22.832
because of what they're water

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:24.300
repairs paid for the land.

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:30.406
So and I know that and sometimes --

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:32.575
A so that the rate payers are

01:08:32.641 --> 01:08:36.045
made whole a new future years

01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:36.679
housing dollars to pay for the

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:40.216
land -- But

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:42.384
if they're not told that that's

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:42.985
what they need to do or that

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:44.286
there's a priority for building

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:44.920
housing then they won't follow

01:08:44.987 --> 01:08:46.255
through with that.

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:46.455
Okay.

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:48.090
Get some ideas.

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:48.791
On Jimmy had some awesome ideas --

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:50.526
I think we've made mention of

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:53.963
these and perhaps other settings --

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:58.033
The course --

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.169
Half with street improvements so

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:00.769
I got Voepel eight years the

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:01.370
city council not knowing what

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:02.338
you're talking about can you

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:04.273
clarify what that is sure I'm

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.141
again I use an example of that

01:09:06.208 --> 01:09:06.809
name in the jurisdiction we were

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:08.611
doing a with in the middle of a

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:10.179
very long walk.

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:12.581
But it legal on block --

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:13.182
There were four houses on two

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:16.552
acres aim is a tragic miss usual

01:09:16.619 --> 01:09:17.186
and but that's another issue we

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:18.454
probably at a hundred yards

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:20.623
maybe a hundred and twenty yards

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:20.956
of frontage.

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:22.658
So the city wanted us to come

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.393
into the street and this is a

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.030
mature street.

01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:30.165
And do a scholarship in.

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:32.001
Bill the half with with curb

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:34.203
gutter and sidewalk and scholar

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.038
back out.

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:38.307
I'm the worst flooding Rangers.

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:38.941
It's not functional and it's a

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:40.342
stupid waste of money --

01:09:40.409 --> 01:09:42.478
And again the my way to handle

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:44.346
to the city believes that as a

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:44.914
future interest in possibly

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:48.083
widening the street.

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:48.651
Then you make me reserve an

01:09:48.717 --> 01:09:50.085
easement.

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:52.221
And agreed not contested so I'm

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:52.788
not saying you abandon it.

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:54.223
Just coincidently the place

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.058
rather for thirty years there's

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.060
a easement in front of my house

01:09:58.127 --> 01:10:00.129
and such okay but you can't but

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:02.097
you low those numbers.

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:04.099
Up front --

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:06.135
You warm up front to the the

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:08.170
reference to the way that cost

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:08.804
for that particular project to

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.272
do well the the to build it

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:12.408
would have been about sixty five

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:14.343
thousand dollars this was part

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:16.278
of the two thousand and thirty

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:16.812
five traffic improvement.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:20.149
Study yes and are they allowed

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:22.151
me to buy out of it for forty

01:10:22.217 --> 01:10:34.830
thousand dollars cash.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:38.067
Which I would bet you --

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:40.035
Nguyen in their general fund.

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:44.039
Which makes it legal yeah.

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:45.941
We can.

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:48.177
One what about deaths in.

01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:50.145
About the legacies of of the

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:52.348
communities and I've.

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:53.015
The one thing a we've learned if

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:54.450
if you look at the city of San

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:56.218
Diego a few the south of ninety

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:56.885
four tiny look at the districts

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:58.320
the deaths are a lot higher

01:10:58.387 --> 01:11:00.055
there.

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:00.656
Now Robert mentioned redlining

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:02.191
you know a lot we're still

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:04.193
living with the legacies of of

01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:04.860
of segregation were living with

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.095
the second of the legacies of

01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:06.495
racial profiling.

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:08.564
So if you look for most of our

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:10.532
land is in the city of San Diego.

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:12.101
It's actually south of the

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:12.701
ninety four the south of the

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:13.268
ninety four has the highest

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:14.069
deaths.

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:16.038
Why is that it's because

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.107
historically it was community of

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:20.376
color so that wasn't capital

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:22.111
invested in?

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:24.346
It's fundamentally unfair and I

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:24.880
think it just continues a

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:26.115
pattern.

01:11:26.181 --> 01:11:28.517
Of of in inadvertent in today's

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:30.152
age but it continues a pattern

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:30.619
of underdevelopment.

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.221
And it might be impossible but I

01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:32.821
think would be interesting if

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:34.590
this instead of being district

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:36.325
by district.

01:11:36.392 --> 01:11:38.293
Or committee by community were

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.295
in the entire the some portion

01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:42.131
of it was in the entire city.

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:44.199
So that you can get money into

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:46.235
these neighborhoods because the

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:48.237
numbers of the value of the unit

01:11:48.303 --> 01:11:50.272
you produce is not high enough

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:52.041
to support.

01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:54.009
The deaths that are indirectly

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:56.078
the result of past political

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.047
decisions to wonder invest.

01:11:58.113 --> 01:11:58.580
That address the issue of

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.349
conserve you're describing of we

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:02.151
can't build in ten years dot

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:02.751
Charlie for right because you

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:04.586
know in many cases these monies

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:06.188
are seen accounts going on spent

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:06.889
and the really hard question is

01:12:06.955 --> 01:12:08.590
this the political society have

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:10.292
an obligation to collectively

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:12.061
put money.

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:14.196
Into a place that have

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:16.098
historically under invested in.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:18.233
As a hard one but I got some

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:18.867
visions for equity agenda for

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:20.335
the city that I think gets to

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:20.803
what you're talking.

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:22.371
To yeah on it last I'd say the

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:26.075
subdivision map act idea makes a

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:28.110
ton of sense to me --

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:28.811
It kind of feels it quickly from

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.045
law would have a similar

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:30.646
approach to maybe the state's

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:32.548
recent actions on as as we go on

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:32.781
units.

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:34.550
Of you to do so the at the state

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:36.485
level they could really

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:38.120
functionally increase the number

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:38.721
of actual doors being bill in

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:40.089
communities took the communities

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:42.124
of maybe generally resistant --

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:44.059
To to housing development is

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:44.626
that right deferred of my

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:45.260
friends the city San Diego has

01:12:45.327 --> 01:12:46.295
been a leader in that they know

01:12:46.361 --> 01:12:47.963
a lot more about those things

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.099
and then I then I do so I would

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:50.432
for to them.

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.234
Added because I did not know

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:54.036
whether many have been built and

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:54.636
how that's worked out to the

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.004
city's trying to make that

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:56.238
happen.

01:12:56.305 --> 01:13:02.177
This really incentivize in and I

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:04.213
would echo the kudos you why

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:08.150
with the city's --

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.152
And that's impressive in you

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.187
know I I one of my usual of

01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:12.855
complaints is that said it is a

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:14.123
lead as much as it needs to or

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:14.456
should -- In

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:16.358
this regard it is leaking --

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:18.026
And it's a that it's by it

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:18.660
legislation was not successful

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.195
not this year at least --

01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:22.331
But stay tuned I think what you

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:24.066
prove something as a concept

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:24.700
it's it working in communities

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:25.167
and actually enriching

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.435
communities looks more likely to

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:28.237
do but I'm not possible without

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:28.804
actual examples of thank you

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:30.539
guys for what you're doing --

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:32.274
But I I think that's an area of

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:32.908
that with this committee would

01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:34.176
be very should pursuing a piece

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.311
of legislation as you say

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:36.612
leading --

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:40.082
Useful and under utilized makes

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.682
zero sense gets built mortar

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.217
Roberts point I think you're

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:42.785
saying because you're type a

01:13:42.851 --> 01:13:44.019
single family home felt aye

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:44.353
freestanding.

01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:46.355
Stuff that we actually create

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:47.990
for sell product.

01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:48.657
And and get another very common

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:50.325
problem exists we talk about

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:52.127
special districts or water

01:13:52.194 --> 01:13:54.129
districts and sewer districts

01:13:54.196 --> 01:13:54.763
and again be anybody in this

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:56.365
room has tried to do any project

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:58.267
is encountered this you come in

01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:00.035
and you're the last person or

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:00.669
you're at that sort of the and

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:02.070
they come.

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:06.542
And say Gee for your five units

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:12.114
you the need I'm only can much I

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:14.316
understand but you're the last

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:14.750
person to show up.

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:16.552
Now I'm not sure which is slated

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:18.320
we how you deal with that but to

01:14:18.387 --> 01:14:20.322
not have the last property

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:20.589
standing.

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:22.224
Have to do a disproportionate

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.459
load and what is in my opinion

01:14:24.526 --> 01:14:26.361
an essential social service like

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:28.397
water sewer for example.

01:14:28.463 --> 01:14:30.332
Is is really hurting and again

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:32.201
what are we talking about to

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:34.036
limit infill existing

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:34.603
communities middle income

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:36.138
housing.

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:38.106
And it's really putting an

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:40.142
unfair burden.

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:40.709
The way and the the way the

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:42.177
Mathis down within these

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:44.079
districts and I've I've seen a

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:46.215
lot and I'm sure everybody else

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:46.481
has also.

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:48.350
Taken a we got over a little

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:49.017
time here so I'll I'll take you

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:50.519
very much for your time and your

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:51.019
your contributions this

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:52.387
afternoon thank you all.

01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:54.223
Three I'll call up the next

01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:56.225
panel and will bring them forth --

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:57.960
Yeah might just you know give

01:14:58.026 --> 01:14:58.527
some homework to my public

01:14:58.594 --> 01:15:00.295
agencies who are here but as you

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:00.929
hear so these ideas if any of

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.531
them stand out. To you from the

01:15:02.598 --> 01:15:04.266
city or stand at either so the

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.134
advocate groups who are here --

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:06.735
I certainly be interested in

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:08.470
your feedback on as we develop

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:10.038
the proposal it's something you

01:15:10.105 --> 01:15:10.272
think.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:22.851
We can do --

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:23.518
At that would certainly make it --

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:28.156
Vice things that we could enter.

01:15:28.223 --> 01:15:30.225
It does but it is instance here

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:34.463
caption steps and and if you can

01:15:34.529 --> 01:15:36.298
bet it out and share with your

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:36.832
agency organization would

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:38.200
support it --

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:40.035
That would be extremely helpful

01:15:40.102 --> 01:15:42.104
as we before developing these

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:42.771
concepts are surrounded our next

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:44.139
panel --

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:46.074
Which focused on middle income

01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:47.943
production minimums --

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:50.412
Jerry made it welcome thank you

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:51.046
that is how it should be a lot

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:52.114
of effort to be here.

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.283
Visit how many cities today to

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:54.750
be present a couple.

01:15:54.816 --> 01:15:58.253
Crossed over into Mexico for a

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:01.990
little bit.

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:04.026
In to Phoenix and sadly Las

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:04.660
Vegas have to do that too just

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.028
to fund affordable housing so --

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:07.930
Illustrates the point I'm I'm so

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:09.965
glad you're here you might start

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:12.301
is off with this man.

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:16.004
Thank you.

01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:28.283
participate I'm here to talk a

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:30.052
little bit about what Kelly to

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:32.120
pay is doing in the mixed income

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:36.058
and missing middle space --

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:36.692
I have a presentation here --

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:38.493
By way of background Kelly to

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.395
phase serves as the state's

01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:42.164
affordable housing lender.

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:44.333
And was created to develop

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:48.270
public Berman and private

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:48.737
capital investment.

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:52.007
Investors to help increase and

01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:54.109

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:56.712
and does not rely on the general

01:16:56.778 --> 01:17:00.048
fund for its operations.

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:02.050
Since its inception college of a

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:02.718
has supported the production and

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:04.353
preservation of multi family

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:05.954
housing.

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:06.488
As well as homeownership

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:08.390

01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:18.300
Provided --

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:20.369
Veterans housing this scope in

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:22.437
approach to a continuum of

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:24.373
housing needs is addressed in

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.208
caliphates mission which is to

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:26.441
create.

01:17:26.508 --> 01:17:28.310
And finance progressive housing

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:30.178
solutions so that more

01:17:30.245 --> 01:17:32.247
Californians have a place to

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:32.581
call home --

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:34.483
As indicated what I'm here to

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:38.020
talk to you about today.

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:40.522
Is our mixed income program but

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:42.357
before I get into the next

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:44.393
income program I wanted to give

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:46.161
you a little bit of history.

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:48.230
Regarding how the funding came

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:50.365
to fruition I'm to my knowledge

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:52.000
this is the only state program

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:54.269
and that is aimed at a continuum

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:56.004
of housing affordability between

01:17:56.071 --> 01:17:58.006
thirty and a hundred and 20%

01:17:58.073 --> 01:18:00.042
area median income which I'll.

01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:02.244
Get to in a minute but as those

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.878
of you in the room might recall

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:06.381
to the the big year for housing

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:08.150
in the state.

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:08.817
I'm not only was a four billion

01:18:08.884 --> 01:18:10.452
dollar housing bond passed by

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:14.089
both the legislature and the

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:16.024
governor which was just --

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:16.591
Approved at the ballot in

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:20.262
November and is going --

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:20.996
To go into went to a fact to and

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:22.197
hopefully that --

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:24.266
Bond is going to recharge a lot

01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:26.168
of our gap financing programs at

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:28.336
the state level but in addition

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:30.372
to that large effort there was --

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:32.307
At at a bill that might have

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.309
gotten a little bit less

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:34.643
notoriety --

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:36.511
But might be very familiar with

01:18:36.578 --> 01:18:38.180
San Diegans because it was

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:42.050
championed by and senator Atkins

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:42.417
at the time --

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:44.319
But it was Senate bill two which

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.221
created the building home and

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:46.521
jobs act --

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:50.058
Which became effective in two

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:50.725
thousand eighteen and what that

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:52.327
did is create a permanent source

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.129
for affordable housing

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:56.064
throughout the state --

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:58.233
It's based on a seventy five

01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:58.767
dollar recreation fee --

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.368
That's recorded on certain real

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:02.003
estate transactions those

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:06.074
resources go into a pot of funds --

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:08.143
Which then is divided I'm Tina

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:12.481
was Nguyen eight city and local

01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:16.318
jurisdictions in 20001915% of

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:16.651
the proceeds.

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:18.420
I'm which is approximated to be

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:20.522
about thirty million dollars

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:22.124
will come to cal HFA.

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:24.292
On to develop a mixed income

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:26.161
housing program.

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:28.029
So that's essentially how we got

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:28.563
to where we are today --

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.365
Our executive director T. about

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.400
men Patterson is very interested

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:34.402
in the concept of more

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:36.505
integrated community is and the

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:40.041
mix of incomes within projects

01:19:40.108 --> 01:19:42.110
which for those of you who are

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:44.179
engaged in the portable housing.

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:44.779
Community husband challenging

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:46.448
because the tax credit program

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:50.318
really focuses on or has in the

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:52.154
past focused on income levels

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.989
and 60% and below.

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:56.124
And so there's been an absence

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:58.326
of production of mixed income

01:19:58.393 --> 01:20:00.295
projects and have a units that

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:02.264
are targeted above I'm sixty or

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:04.132
80%.

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:04.799
Just because they've been really

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:08.003
challenging to finance --

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:10.238
So -- For

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:12.240
the last year Callie Jeff a has

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:14.142
been out --

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:14.676
Talking to the development

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:20.015
community out financing units

01:20:20.081 --> 01:20:22.150
outside of the tax credit round.

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:24.352
Given the loss of both the tax

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:26.221
credit financing and what is

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:28.390
used to finance projects in

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:30.258
California --

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:32.194
The welfare exemption which

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:32.727
exams affordable housing

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:34.396
projects from property taxes.

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:36.498
I'm it's really challenging for

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:38.333
developers to produce units

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.435
outside of the tax credit

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:40.702
program.

01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:42.370
And we heard a lot of this

01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:44.239
feedback from the development

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:46.374
community.

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:50.212
And so we we kind of came back

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:50.712
with all that that that

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:52.080
information.

01:20:52.147 --> 01:20:56.251
And we crafted a program to try

01:20:56.318 --> 01:20:58.053
to reflect the market conditions

01:20:58.119 --> 01:21:00.155
that exist in the community.

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:02.123
And what we've done is we're

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:04.125
trying to leverage our existing

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:04.693
affordable housing programs

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:07.963
through the bond and 4% tax

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:10.131
arena -- And

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:10.765
to try to leverage on the fact

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:12.100
that -- The

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:14.135
federal government approved new

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:16.071
income averaging laws which

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:18.206
allow projects --

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:24.045
To target unit 60% up 280% as

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:26.448
long as I'm the average

01:21:26.514 --> 01:21:28.350
affordability is is 60%.

01:21:28.416 --> 01:21:30.619
And then also we're trying to

01:21:30.685 --> 01:21:32.153
provide incentives but not

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.089
mandates that --

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:36.191
Developers included tron XIV

01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:38.493
units that go above her outside

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.228
the tax credit --

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:42.564
Restrictions so that were really

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.366
creating a continuum of housing

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:46.167
with in projects with.

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:48.036
Some units that will be targeted

01:21:48.103 --> 01:21:50.672
below sixty sixty eighty and

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.440
then hopefully above eighty as

01:21:52.507 --> 01:21:52.641
well.

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:54.643
I am we initially sent out a

01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:56.411
term sheet in late August this

01:21:56.478 --> 01:21:58.380
year we received a lot of

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:00.148
feedback from the development

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:00.682
community and we've been

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:02.350
retooling our term sheet.

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:04.185
Sense then --

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:06.154
But generally our program will

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:08.223
be focused on new construction I

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:08.757
think assembly member --

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:12.193
Gloria was was perceptive with

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:12.794
regard to the fact that we're

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:14.429
just not producing enough units

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:16.398
in the state to keep pace with

01:22:16.464 --> 01:22:16.631
demand.

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:18.366
And so --

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.335
There is a supply problem --

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:22.237
You know all others argue that

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:23.972
there is there is a demand

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:26.074
problem as well but but markedly

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:26.741
we have just not been producing

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:30.145
enough units to keep pace with

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:30.512
with the need.

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:32.047
I'm so this program husband I'm

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:34.249
specifically designed as a new

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:34.716
construction program.

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:36.551
Their resources that college of

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:40.088
Faye receives from --

01:22:40.155 --> 01:22:42.157
The permanent so born and

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:44.626
financing very similar to the

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.161
way other --

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:48.129
Programs are structured at the

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:50.231
state level and the unique thing

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:50.832
about the program is that the

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:52.500
resources will be able to be

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:53.001
used on units that are

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:54.669
restricted anywhere from thirty

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:58.206
two hundred and 20% area median

01:22:58.273 --> 01:22:58.473
income --

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:02.077
And the resources --

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:04.212
Will be paired with a bond and

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:06.181
or bond in tax credit project.

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:08.416
But the number of tax credited

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:12.220
units can be as little as 20% of

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:14.289
the units on side so it could be

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:16.324
a very -- It

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:18.126
could be a partial tax credit

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:20.028
and market rate development --

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:24.165
The units could also go up 281%

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:24.866
we're trying to provide people a

01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:26.234
lot of flexibility.

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.436
With regard to what they end up

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:30.171
building but trying to pair it

01:23:30.238 --> 01:23:31.973
with existing --

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.275
Under utilized resources at the

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:36.144
state level --

01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:38.546
There are going to be --

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:40.281
To preferences --

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:42.117
In addition to some geographic

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:46.187
and project type parameters that

01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:46.755
will govern the program --

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:50.191
We are gonna give priority to

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:50.525
acts that --

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:52.627
Target at least 10% of their

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:54.429
units to eighty one two hundred

01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:58.032
and 20% area median income.

01:23:58.099 --> 01:24:00.001
I'm it will be a requirement of

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:02.137
the program but to the extent

01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:02.704
that a feasible option for

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:04.305
people we want to try.

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:08.109
To encourage people --

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:10.178
To target that level and we

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:10.812
definitely heard the challenges

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:12.280
in developing those sorts of

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:14.149
units given the loss of tax

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:16.050
credits in the welfare exception.

01:24:16.117 --> 01:24:18.219
But the development community is

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:18.553
remarkably --

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:20.522
Creative and we're hopeful that

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:22.223
they'll be some interesting

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.058
ideas that they're able to bring

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:24.426
to the table --

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:26.561
The other preference will be the

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:28.229
lowest --

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:30.064
Subsidy request per unit.

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:32.400
The idea here is to try to

01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:34.169
incentivize developers to

01:24:34.235 --> 01:24:36.237
leverage other resources to the

01:24:36.304 --> 01:24:38.173
greatest extent possible and to

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:40.375
try to reduce costs as as much

01:24:40.442 --> 01:24:42.110
as possible --

01:24:42.177 --> 01:24:44.546
In addition to those preferences

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:48.383
we are trying to ensure that

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:48.750
there is some.

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:50.185
Geographical distribution of the

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:54.489
projects and no one county will

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:56.591
be able to receive more than

01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:58.226
fifteen million dollars of the

01:24:58.293 --> 01:24:59.994
subordinate financing.

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:02.130
And we also want to ensure that

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:04.165
we have more than one sponsor is

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:06.401
able to benefit from the program.

01:25:06.468 --> 01:25:08.102
And so -- No

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:10.171
one sponsor will be able to

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:10.772
obtain more than ten million

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:12.474
dollars of resources.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.209
In addition to that --

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:14.609
There will be --

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:18.446
Housing to family units --

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:22.517
40% of the of the resources

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:24.452
targeted to projects will be a

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:28.122
to projects that have at least --

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:30.158
25% three bedrooms and no more

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:32.427
than 40% of the resources.

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:36.030
That are provided --

01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:36.664
Through the program will be for

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:38.466
senior projects there's been a

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:40.235
lot of discussion about micro

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:40.535
units -- I

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:43.938
think especially in San Diego

01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:46.307
and college Ave is really open --

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:48.476
To the idea and the creativity

01:25:48.543 --> 01:25:50.545
that developers are harnessing

01:25:50.612 --> 01:25:52.380
with my car units but we still

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:54.282
want to ensure that some of that

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:56.017
units produced as a result of

01:25:56.084 --> 01:25:58.052
this program --

01:25:58.119 --> 01:26:00.121
Are targeted for families --

01:26:00.188 --> 01:26:12.333
The program will allow of forty

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.035
thousand dollars per unit per

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:16.437
restricted unit and so.

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:18.473
It's not only the that are eight

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:20.475
on the U. it's it's all of the

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:22.343
all of the restricted units in

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:22.977
the project we're hopeful that

01:26:23.044 --> 01:26:23.444
this makes the program

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:24.479
attractive to developers.

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:24.812
That have --

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:26.481
Potentially bond in tax credit

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:30.051
deals -- In

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:30.652
order to become feasible and

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:32.453
they might convert them to meet

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:36.057
this prototype and also bring.

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:36.724
Potentially other projects into

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:38.593
the mix that wouldn't have been

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:42.163
feasible absent this money --

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:44.299
Into the mix the we will charge

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:46.100
the percent simple interest for

01:26:46.167 --> 01:26:48.036
the resources --

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:52.173
So that is the general --

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.342
Kind of an overview of the

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:56.377
program we are hopeful --

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:58.379
That the thirty to thirty five

01:26:58.446 --> 01:27:00.715
million dollars that we produce

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:02.083
will result in --

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:04.285
You know seven to ten mixed

01:27:04.352 --> 01:27:06.387
income projects throughout the

01:27:06.454 --> 01:27:08.189
state it's not --

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:10.124
A significant amount of units

01:27:10.191 --> 01:27:12.126
but it is --

01:27:12.193 --> 01:27:14.295
It is important and I think we

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:15.964
will begin --

01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:18.232
To create space within the mixed

01:27:18.299 --> 01:27:20.134
income missing middle I'm

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:20.435
continue --

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:23.972
That we hope will will catch on

01:27:24.038 --> 01:27:26.274
the program roll out and is

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:28.176
scheduled --

01:27:28.242 --> 01:27:30.411
In mid January we will go to our

01:27:30.478 --> 01:27:41.189
board for approval in mid

01:27:41.255 --> 01:27:44.125
January and will roll out term

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:44.392
sheets --

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:46.260
There after we will be is into

01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:50.164
put on February action.

01:27:50.231 --> 01:27:50.832
Solicit applications by the end

01:27:50.898 --> 01:27:52.166
of April.

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:52.667
There was a slight --

01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:53.301
Correction that I wanted to make

01:27:53.368 --> 01:27:54.202
or just I guess the difference

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:56.170
with regard to our single family

01:27:56.237 --> 01:27:58.473
programs it was it was stated in

01:27:58.539 --> 01:28:00.041
the presentation before that the

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:00.575
additional one point five

01:28:00.642 --> 01:28:02.477
million dollars of down payment

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:04.278
assistance would --

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:08.282
Potentially SS --

01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:09.951
Fifteen thousand homeowners and

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:14.188
are that it will assist at up to

01:28:14.255 --> 01:28:16.024
twenty thousand I'm homeowner so

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:16.357
with that --

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:20.061
All hands --

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:22.063
The Mike over to them part.

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:22.697
Thank you bad thanks for being

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:23.898
here.

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:26.234
Questions first year what taken

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.069
together okay.

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:28.703
So my name's been work on with

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:29.337
the California municipal finance

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:30.471
authority it's a group most of

01:28:30.538 --> 01:28:32.040
you have never heard of but we

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:34.008
are kh to a bond issuer.

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:34.575
What that means is we just

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:36.210
actors that we just issue the

01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:36.811
bonds we don't actually have

01:28:36.878 --> 01:28:38.246
money in the project --

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:40.281
The same FAA we do a bunch of

01:28:40.348 --> 01:28:41.983
other things besides affordable

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:42.617
housing but at this point we've

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:44.352
done about six billion dollars

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:46.087
in affordable housing bonds --

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:50.258
That's been about four hundred

01:28:50.324 --> 01:28:50.658
twenty projects.

01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:52.226
Which it was about thirty five

01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:52.827
thousand units throughout the

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:53.094
state --

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:54.328
Currently have worked in over

01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:56.264
four hundred cities and counties

01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:58.066
and states.

01:28:58.132 --> 01:28:58.566
Wanted citizen counties

01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:00.201
throughout the state --

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:02.336
Seem if a we also have a kind of

01:29:02.403 --> 01:29:04.138
a sister organization we do

01:29:04.205 --> 01:29:06.140
nation wide issuances.

01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:06.774
And I've worked in the state of

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:10.445
Oregon since New Hampshire and

01:29:10.511 --> 01:29:11.979
Florida.

01:29:12.046 --> 01:29:14.215
Doing bond issuances in local

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:16.184
jurisdictions there --

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:17.952
The reason I I say this is

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:18.553
because I kind of I feel like

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:30.998
I'm a macro perspective of

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:34.035
affordable housing in the way

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:34.435
things are done --

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:36.003
Not all.

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.604
California but throughout the

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:38.039
and then I've been able to see

01:29:38.106 --> 01:29:38.639
over the past couple years --

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:40.141
Other states.

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:42.143
Operate and how they do their

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:42.777
four wheel housing and it's been

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:43.444
interesting to see the different

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:44.112
programs and incentives that --

01:29:44.178 --> 01:29:46.147
Other states offer is anyone

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:48.082
been Cañada lately.

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:50.251
I haven't either but apparently

01:29:50.318 --> 01:29:50.952
there's no homeless people there.

01:29:51.018 --> 01:29:52.520
So what why it why do they have

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:53.988
no homeless in the we have LA

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:54.589
were closing off entire city

01:29:54.655 --> 01:29:56.124
blocks for homeless people.

01:29:56.190 --> 01:30:07.101
You know or you look at New York

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:08.002
wise the homeless population

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:10.071
increasing rapidly in Boston

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:13.975
homeless population.

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:16.077
Decreasing wrapping.

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:18.045
To so.

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:19.981
Stop.

01:30:20.047 --> 01:30:20.581
To speak local instead as for

01:30:20.648 --> 01:30:24.051
producing that middle.

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:24.318
Bracket --

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:26.087
Bowls of people that are really.

01:30:26.154 --> 01:30:28.222
In a tangible benefit there's

01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:30.091
not many there's not very many

01:30:30.158 --> 01:30:30.725
programs the California has to

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:32.226
offer cities don't get some

01:30:32.293 --> 01:30:32.460
kinda.

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:34.328
Extra bonus they don't get some

01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:36.130
kind of vouchers or anything

01:30:36.197 --> 01:30:36.798
like that because they produced.

01:30:36.864 --> 01:30:40.368
X. amount of homes it's 70% area

01:30:40.434 --> 01:30:41.969
median income --

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:42.603
But obviously there's a lot of

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:45.973
intangible benefits diversifying

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:46.474
housing the markets --

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:48.276
Surveying people that are

01:30:48.342 --> 01:30:50.244
underserved behaving being able

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:52.213
to keep families in place.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.048
On keeping transportation costs

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:54.615
down there's a bunch a macro

01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:56.017
economic.

01:30:56.083 --> 01:30:56.617
Statistics statistics you to

01:30:56.684 --> 01:30:58.452
look at for families that live

01:30:58.519 --> 01:31:00.254
within a certain.

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:02.089
Area is a poster driving into

01:31:02.156 --> 01:31:02.323
those.

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:04.392
Those areas so if you're looking

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:06.194
at a map review affordable

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.296
housing is actually very simple.

01:31:08.362 --> 01:31:09.897
To qualify for affordable

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:10.531
housing project you need forty

01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:13.935
first you need to have 60%.

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:16.204
Very median income and 40% of

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:18.105
the units that were you do 50%

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:20.408
area median income in 20% of the

01:31:20.474 --> 01:31:20.641
units.

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:22.276
On a federal level that's it

01:31:22.343 --> 01:31:24.111
there's nothing else.

01:31:24.178 --> 01:31:26.080
In the state we have overlays

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:28.149
upon overlays upon overlays of

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:30.084
things that need to happen to be

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:30.284
able.

01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:30.751
To issue the bonds for

01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:33.921
affordable housing before they

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:34.422
so it's an interesting

01:31:34.488 --> 01:31:36.190
perspective if you go to

01:31:36.257 --> 01:31:38.226
Tennessee or go to Texas to get

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:39.994
in for will housing you just go

01:31:40.061 --> 01:31:40.595
to the state treasures window

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:42.263
say I want to affordable housing.

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:43.998
They give you allocation.

01:31:44.065 --> 01:31:46.234
And there you go you're you're

01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:47.969
you're moving right along --

01:31:48.035 --> 01:31:50.137
If you're in not the city but if

01:31:50.204 --> 01:31:50.838
you're in other cities it can be

01:31:50.905 --> 01:31:52.173
up to a year and a half right

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:52.807
now just to get an inducement

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:54.008
resolution.

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:56.110
Which really starts the window

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:56.744
of being able to capture those

01:31:56.811 --> 01:31:59.881
costs and bonds in your taxes

01:31:59.947 --> 01:32:00.481
are Bonta make your financing

01:32:00.548 --> 01:32:01.916
much cheaper.

01:32:01.983 --> 01:32:04.118
So we got a look at what what's

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:04.752
hurting affordable housing and

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:07.989
and what I've seen on the

01:32:08.055 --> 01:32:08.623
hundred plus housing bills I do

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:09.023
a year [inaudible]

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:10.024
Is.

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:10.725
This nor trên obviously we lost

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:12.426
already a we lost the gap

01:32:12.493 --> 01:32:14.362
financing were luckily getting

01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:16.430
some gap financing coming back.

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:16.998
That's not going to cure the

01:32:17.064 --> 01:32:18.366
problem but one of the bigger

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:20.101
problems that we've seen.

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:22.270
Is construction costs in the

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:24.338
delays and timing so projects

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:25.907
going up so right now we're

01:32:25.973 --> 01:32:28.042
we're about 829% of our projects

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:28.743
having to go back into said lack

01:32:28.809 --> 01:32:30.444
and receive supplemental

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:30.745
allocation.

01:32:30.811 --> 01:32:32.413
Where they have to increase

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.048
their barring amount?

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:36.017
As a construction costs have

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:36.651
gone up in the year that they

01:32:36.717 --> 01:32:38.319
decided to doing the project.

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:40.254
We've done a lot of projects

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:41.956
that sister projects.

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:43.925
That within one year

01:32:43.991 --> 01:32:46.060
construction costs not locales

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:46.560
gone up almost a 100%.

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:48.396
And so really one of the driving

01:32:48.462 --> 01:32:50.164
factors I think to producing

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:52.066
affordable housing.

01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:54.001
At the forty and 60% of them are --

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:58.072
Sorry 1650% in my in --

01:32:58.139 --> 01:33:00.174
Those higher brackets is

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:02.343
speeding up the process making

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.178
things --

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:05.980
Much easier to do.

01:33:06.047 --> 01:33:08.182
And we are going to then a

01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:08.449
second --

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:10.251
But making the process much

01:33:10.318 --> 01:33:13.955
easier and to get construction

01:33:14.021 --> 01:33:14.588
part started because if you're

01:33:14.655 --> 01:33:16.457
adding an extra couple million

01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:18.192
dollars in the financing of

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:18.826
borrowing to produce the same

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:20.494
amount of units it's not doing.

01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:22.029
Anything for us.

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:22.630
And that's really one of the

01:33:22.697 --> 01:33:24.332
biggest things we're looking at

01:33:24.398 --> 01:33:26.067
is a five ten years will ten

01:33:26.133 --> 01:33:26.701
years ago we're really looking

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:28.369
at greening every affordable

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.003
housing project there was they

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:30.137
couldn't figure out.

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:32.273
Why we ballooning three hundred

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:32.907
twenty five thousand dollars per

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:35.943
unit and now we're getting?

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:36.477
Six fifty seven fifty San

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:37.044
Francisco sitting a million

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:38.312
dollars per affordable housing

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:39.914
in it you're in riverside you're

01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:40.581
hitting five in a fifty thousand

01:33:40.648 --> 01:33:42.216
dollars per unit you can build a

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:42.450
house.

01:33:42.516 --> 01:33:44.185
Interceptor five in a fifty

01:33:44.251 --> 01:33:44.719
thousand dollars but we're

01:33:44.785 --> 01:33:46.120
building a single unit an

01:33:46.187 --> 01:33:47.955
apartment complex.

01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:50.558
Some things don't make sense and

01:33:50.624 --> 01:33:51.192
so we really got a look at the

01:33:51.258 --> 01:33:51.959
fees.

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:52.593
That are being charged we got a

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.428
look at the overall construction

01:33:54.495 --> 01:33:56.230
overall costs it's not just a

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:58.132
simple cost it's all the things

01:33:58.199 --> 01:33:58.499
that are added.

01:33:58.566 --> 01:34:00.267
And then the timing because the

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:02.003
unfortunately the developers are

01:34:02.069 --> 01:34:03.971
competing its market rate guys.

01:34:04.038 --> 01:34:04.505
And they don't have to go

01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:06.107
through the entire process

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:08.342
getting crushed it's taking year

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:10.611
to get going on a project where

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:12.380
mercury guys can get going right

01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:14.081
away.

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:14.582
And in that time their

01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:16.283
construction sought throughout

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:18.052
the state and it's getting hard

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:20.254
to line up the the construction

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:22.189
companies to get moving on the

01:34:22.256 --> 01:34:22.857
projects and so the the cost of

01:34:22.923 --> 01:34:24.592
the project --

01:34:24.658 --> 01:34:24.959
On increasing.

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:26.160
So one of the things to benefits

01:34:26.227 --> 01:34:28.662
or two two bright spots I see --

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:30.264
Unfortunately bonds are still a

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:33.968
little bit behind on tax credits

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:34.168
bonds.

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:36.003
If you're.

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:36.604
It 60% so you have one get 61%

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:38.372
doesn't matter federal doesn't

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:38.572
care.

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:40.374
So that you don't get any extra

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:42.209
benefit for doing for bringing

01:34:42.276 --> 01:34:44.111
in somebody at 61% --

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:46.414
For tax credits they've recently

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:50.117
made some changes and now you

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:50.718
can average incomes so we're

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:52.486
hoping within this next let you

01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:52.787
what -- And

01:34:52.853 --> 01:34:54.355
federal legislation cycle the

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:56.524
bonds may be able to catch up in

01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:58.092
your you can average income a

01:34:58.159 --> 01:34:58.692
lot more and I think that'll

01:34:58.759 --> 01:35:00.061
directly impact --

01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:02.196
Whatever what's your for today's

01:35:02.263 --> 01:35:06.033
you can start adding since --

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:08.369
7080% area median incomes maybe

01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:09.970
even higher.

01:35:10.037 --> 01:35:10.604
An average it down with some of

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:12.273
the lower median incomes --

01:35:12.339 --> 01:35:14.041
In with that that's I mean

01:35:14.108 --> 01:35:14.608
that's just kind of the map

01:35:14.675 --> 01:35:16.277
reviews of what I've seen.

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:16.944
And we will be happy to take any

01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:20.347
questions it's awesome of thank

01:35:20.414 --> 01:35:22.383
you both for presenting --

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:24.485
Injury I'm sorry I think it's a

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:26.153
bit stretching aim at the

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:26.454
beginning.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.021
Above should happens a fair

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:28.355
amount but I'm grateful that

01:35:28.422 --> 01:35:30.558
publicly all the effort you made

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:30.958
to be here today.

01:35:31.025 --> 01:35:32.393
Up you know I think you the

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.228
first panel did talk about

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:36.130
Michael units --

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:38.132
Any mention an openness okay

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:38.699
talk a little bit more about

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:40.434
that that seem to get a better

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:42.069
traction --

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:44.505
In in the early part of this

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:44.772
hearing.

01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:46.240
Yeah I think that --

01:35:46.307 --> 01:35:48.242
Micro units have been response

01:35:48.309 --> 01:35:50.311
in in somewhat to the increasing

01:35:50.377 --> 01:35:52.480
construction costs and just the

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:54.281
changing demographics in urban

01:35:54.348 --> 01:35:56.250
areas. To try to address the

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:58.052
housing needs --

01:35:58.119 --> 01:36:00.488
I think that you know out I've

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:02.423
spent most of my career in a

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:04.492
kind of traditional bond in the

01:36:04.558 --> 01:36:06.293
in the traditional bond and tax

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.162
credit world and there's there's

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.596
very prescriptive.

01:36:08.662 --> 01:36:10.397
Especially in the 9% program

01:36:10.464 --> 01:36:13.901
kind of very prescriptive --

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:16.270
Criteria for projects and unit

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:20.074
sizes --

01:36:20.141 --> 01:36:24.278
Eight I think they front types

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:26.013
is of house I think so.

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:30.217
That we word word trusting

01:36:30.284 --> 01:36:32.153
market concerns --

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:32.786
And that the projects that are

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:34.255
being constructed with

01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:36.190
subordinate financing are are

01:36:36.257 --> 01:36:38.492
consistent with with what is

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:40.194
being produced by the market.

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:42.096
So we're not producing markets

01:36:42.163 --> 01:36:44.198
are subsidizing Ana projects

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:46.367
that are that are inconsistent

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:48.335
with with what is going on in

01:36:48.402 --> 01:36:51.972
local markets but I think were

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:54.008
definitely open --

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:55.976
And you know there's been a lot

01:36:56.043 --> 01:36:56.477
of discussion about --

01:36:56.544 --> 01:36:59.880
Modular unit sand bringing in

01:36:59.947 --> 01:37:00.281
the kind of kid.

01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:02.116
Different sorts of storage

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:03.951
containers --

01:37:04.018 --> 01:37:06.020
Menu better man pre manufactured

01:37:06.086 --> 01:37:07.888
to decrease --

01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:09.924
Construction times I'm so I

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.424
think there's a lot of

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:12.293
innovation going on in the kind

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:14.195
of the bill environment

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:16.197
associated with affordable

01:37:16.263 --> 01:37:17.965
housing which we want to be open --

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:20.134
To we just also want to be

01:37:20.201 --> 01:37:22.136
really cognitive that we we were

01:37:22.203 --> 01:37:23.971
we continue to serve --

01:37:24.038 --> 01:37:26.073
Families and seniors given --

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:29.910
That they they are a large

01:37:29.977 --> 01:37:32.146
population of need it with in

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:38.152
the group of individuals that.

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:40.554
One of my that's a full here the

01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:41.922
the part of the previous

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:44.091
conversation was --

01:37:44.158 --> 01:37:44.658
And observation that these

01:37:44.725 --> 01:37:46.427
projects are are permissible

01:37:46.493 --> 01:37:48.028
under kind of existing codes --

01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:50.064
But that the challenges been

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:50.397
financing --

01:37:50.464 --> 01:37:52.032
In some ways and the

01:37:52.099 --> 01:37:54.335
presentation of Doug still here --

01:37:54.401 --> 01:37:56.203
Of trying to do with private

01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:58.138
financing for a variety of

01:37:58.205 --> 01:37:58.439
reasons --

01:37:58.505 --> 01:38:00.107
But it at all knowledge meant or

01:38:00.174 --> 01:38:02.142
even an interest --

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:02.710
For public financing in the

01:38:02.776 --> 01:38:03.978
space --

01:38:04.044 --> 01:38:06.213
Might be to the the last piece

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:06.847
to actually get the doors open

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:07.214
on the string.

01:38:07.281 --> 01:38:10.184
Bed you made mention of that for

01:38:10.251 --> 01:38:11.986
door costs --

01:38:12.052 --> 01:38:14.288
Recognizing the part B. play

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:16.223
this pick the role --

01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:16.757
Eight any observations on

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:17.958
jurisdictions are doing well and

01:38:18.025 --> 01:38:18.525
getting that number down or

01:38:18.592 --> 01:38:33.007
bringing it down.

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:33.340
Well.

01:38:33.407 --> 01:38:38.045
If you're using.

01:38:38.112 --> 01:38:40.047
Fifties living where you can.

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:41.915
You know look it's on for says

01:38:41.982 --> 01:38:44.018
there's a strong requires

01:38:44.084 --> 01:38:44.285
required.

01:38:44.351 --> 01:38:47.921
Where you're? One of the things

01:38:47.988 --> 01:38:48.555
was done as the title twenty

01:38:48.622 --> 01:38:50.124
four requirements that were put

01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:50.724
into place while ago really.

01:38:50.791 --> 01:38:51.325
Increase and things are coming

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:52.159
down from there.

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:54.228
But jurisdiction wise I think of

01:38:54.295 --> 01:38:55.996
a cost per door is that how

01:38:56.063 --> 01:38:56.697
quickly a financing can get done.

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:57.398
And that's from the start of the

01:38:57.464 --> 01:38:58.299
financing to getting into said

01:38:58.365 --> 01:39:00.100
lack. To getting the bonds

01:39:00.167 --> 01:39:01.935
issued --

01:39:02.002 --> 01:39:04.471
Take a year to go through that

01:39:04.538 --> 01:39:04.738
process.

01:39:04.805 --> 01:39:06.140
And it's because of all the

01:39:06.206 --> 01:39:06.740
checks and balances that been

01:39:06.807 --> 01:39:10.010
put into place --

01:39:10.077 --> 01:39:11.945
A lot of its very redundant and

01:39:12.012 --> 01:39:12.546
there's a lot of you know some

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:14.415
of the cities and counties just

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:14.615
have.

01:39:14.682 --> 01:39:16.383
This is how it's done it's

01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:18.018
always been down that way and

01:39:18.085 --> 01:39:18.619
that's just how it's going to

01:39:18.686 --> 01:39:19.987
continue to be done.

01:39:20.054 --> 01:39:20.654
And it's just their own internal

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:22.189
policies and procedures as

01:39:22.256 --> 01:39:22.723
opposed to what's really

01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:24.124
required on federal or state

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:25.993
level to be able to qualify.

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.128
So that time line if you can get

01:39:28.195 --> 01:39:30.197
to the dirt quicker it's

01:39:30.264 --> 01:39:32.032
obviously gonna bring down per

01:39:32.099 --> 01:39:32.232
door.

01:39:32.299 --> 01:39:34.234
And we've seen a working with a

01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:34.902
lot of cities and counties over

01:39:34.968 --> 01:39:45.245
the last little while.

01:39:45.312 --> 01:39:48.349
We've seen cities and counties --

01:39:48.415 --> 01:39:52.086
At asks to come help them

01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:52.720
through the process [inaudible]

01:39:52.786 --> 01:39:56.457
Gone. Two dozen counties and

01:39:56.523 --> 01:39:57.091
they're getting the process is

01:39:57.157 --> 01:39:57.958
down.

01:39:58.025 --> 01:39:58.592
Procedures Donald a little bit

01:39:58.659 --> 01:40:00.127
so they can get into said lack

01:40:00.194 --> 01:40:02.029
and to teach các and to be able

01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:02.629
to have the bonds issued at a

01:40:02.696 --> 01:40:02.996
quicker pace.

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:04.331
Interpreting question the

01:40:04.398 --> 01:40:04.965
purpose of this hearing is to

01:40:05.032 --> 01:40:06.100
tease out legislative ideas and

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:07.968
concepts of between.

01:40:08.035 --> 01:40:10.037
Nineteen legislative year.

01:40:10.104 --> 01:40:21.949
In that sort --

01:40:22.015 --> 01:40:24.118
Guidance that would be okay

01:40:24.184 --> 01:40:25.953
legislation that might prescribe

01:40:26.019 --> 01:40:26.587
a time line to get you to get

01:40:26.653 --> 01:40:28.188
two things we have.

01:40:28.255 --> 01:40:30.157
The bonds will be fixed and to

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:31.992
kind of a long term.

01:40:32.059 --> 01:40:32.659
The construction cost seems to

01:40:32.726 --> 01:40:34.228
be one of the bigger problems I

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:34.795
think the developers are.

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:36.397
Are hitting right now and

01:40:36.463 --> 01:40:38.165
there's a lot of local

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:38.766
requirements like I said I've

01:40:38.832 --> 01:40:39.366
worked in for her plus cities

01:40:39.433 --> 01:40:40.067
and counties.

01:40:40.134 --> 01:40:40.701
Throughout the state the require

01:40:40.768 --> 01:40:42.069
different things that.

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:42.703
You would put on your own home

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:44.538
yeah and it really drives up the

01:40:44.605 --> 01:40:46.273
cost per unit and they don't

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:46.507
pencil.

01:40:46.573 --> 01:40:47.908
You know northern California

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:48.575
just as an example because I can.

01:40:48.642 --> 01:40:50.010
Known for the California terms

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:52.112
and but there's a lot of the the

01:40:52.179 --> 01:40:53.981
lot of the developers will add

01:40:54.047 --> 01:40:57.918
on every random --

01:40:57.985 --> 01:40:58.519
Bonus they can get within like

01:40:58.585 --> 01:41:00.287
the celebrity school programs in

01:41:00.354 --> 01:41:02.122
a senior facility.

01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:02.723
Does make any sense but they

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:04.258
want to score the Max amount of

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:05.926
points and they they commit

01:41:05.993 --> 01:41:06.460
themselves themselves to

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:08.328
different things or cities and

01:41:08.395 --> 01:41:08.862
counties will make them do

01:41:08.929 --> 01:41:10.164
different things after to the

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:11.965
project.

01:41:12.032 --> 01:41:12.533
Which really costs a lot per

01:41:12.599 --> 01:41:14.101
unit.

01:41:14.168 --> 01:41:16.570
And so it's a matter of cities

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:17.137
and counties looking through

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:18.038
their affordable house

01:41:18.105 --> 01:41:20.007
requirements and saying do we

01:41:20.073 --> 01:41:20.641
want to build affordable housing

01:41:20.707 --> 01:41:22.142
projects.

01:41:22.209 --> 01:41:22.709
Or do we just kinda want to

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:24.211
manager process ago is

01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:26.213
interpreting you saying was that

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.081
there were --

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:28.382
Perhaps --

01:41:28.449 --> 01:41:29.016
Public hearings or procedural

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:30.384
votes a redundancy in that

01:41:30.451 --> 01:41:32.419
process that you're perhaps we

01:41:32.486 --> 01:41:34.221
could make clarify that those

01:41:34.288 --> 01:41:34.788
are necessary or or even

01:41:34.855 --> 01:41:36.023
actually counterproductive so

01:41:36.089 --> 01:41:36.657
there's a few federal once you

01:41:36.723 --> 01:41:38.392
have to do to be able to get

01:41:38.459 --> 01:41:51.071
your bonds unit of an inducement

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:51.572
have to have a tougher.

01:41:51.638 --> 01:41:52.206
Yet of a final resolution --

01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:56.076
Inducement resolutions you can

01:41:56.143 --> 01:41:58.011
show me clear this is since

01:41:58.078 --> 01:42:02.082
you're you're doing it able.

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.649
Can capture any bond good.

01:42:02.716 --> 01:42:03.951
The bonds.

01:42:04.017 --> 01:42:04.551
There's a lot of cities and

01:42:04.618 --> 01:42:06.186
counties you work with to do the

01:42:06.253 --> 01:42:08.255
tough for her you know for

01:42:08.322 --> 01:42:08.755
helping them with their

01:42:08.822 --> 01:42:09.122
inducements --

01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:10.290
It may take him three four

01:42:10.357 --> 01:42:10.924
months just to get going on an

01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:12.459
inducement an inducement is done

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:16.129
by the city's --

01:42:16.196 --> 01:42:16.730
Bond counselor that it's the

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:17.364
bond counts the rights the let

01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:17.764
the resolution.

01:42:17.831 --> 01:42:18.398
In an inducement should really

01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:19.032
take more than two weeks for a

01:42:19.099 --> 01:42:19.666
total review I don't even know

01:42:19.733 --> 01:42:20.467
why would take two weeks from an

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:20.968
application to review.

01:42:21.034 --> 01:42:22.069
As opposed --

01:42:22.135 --> 01:42:24.371
To I'm doing it tough for right

01:42:24.438 --> 01:42:26.106
now on working with and do some

01:42:26.173 --> 01:42:30.344
processes hearings to do

01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:30.611
whatever.

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:32.446
And so a tough for a firm this

01:42:32.513 --> 01:42:34.548
and now a tougher as mandated by --

01:42:34.615 --> 01:42:36.049
Nineteen eighty four tax code

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:36.717
essentially just says you have

01:42:36.783 --> 01:42:38.452
to have a fourteen day notice

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:39.152
they've updated that's also hard

01:42:39.219 --> 01:42:39.987
notice.

01:42:40.053 --> 01:42:40.554
Any out of a public hearing

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:41.989
that's it.

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:42.623
If you're in Texas you can be

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:44.391
five counties over within twenty

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:46.326
five miles and the tempers good

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:46.960
you don't even have to be when

01:42:47.027 --> 01:42:47.995
you're jurisdiction.

01:42:48.061 --> 01:42:49.963
So there's all these different

01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.631
things that we deal with tougher

01:42:50.697 --> 01:42:52.499
as to look one zero sum up they

01:42:52.566 --> 01:42:54.368
have a five step process were

01:42:54.434 --> 01:42:54.902
first they have a tougher

01:42:54.968 --> 01:42:56.003
hearing.

01:42:56.069 --> 01:42:56.603
And then they have a tougher

01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:58.338
monitoring and they have the

01:42:58.405 --> 01:43:00.173
actual hearing it city council

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.075
in your to wait another two

01:43:02.142 --> 01:43:03.977
weeks to do the ratification and

01:43:04.044 --> 01:43:04.611
then two more weeks to get the

01:43:04.678 --> 01:43:06.046
numbers minutes before you get

01:43:06.113 --> 01:43:06.547
your actual approval.

01:43:06.613 --> 01:43:12.085
That that that adds months under

01:43:12.152 --> 01:43:12.319
project.

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:15.923
Which doesn't do anything yeah.

01:43:15.989 --> 01:43:16.256
Interesting.

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:18.392
That maybe some for follow.

01:43:18.458 --> 01:43:20.561
Up there with one of our time

01:43:20.627 --> 01:43:21.995
thank you are both --

01:43:22.062 --> 01:43:22.296

Presentations --

01:43:24.231 --> 01:43:25.933

01:43:25.999 --> 01:43:26.533
panel this afternoon thank you

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:30.037

Panel discussion so we'll

01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:32.306

01:43:34.074 --> 01:43:34.308
capture --

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:36.376
On the video and audio --

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:38.211

01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:00.601
executive director of the San

Diego housing federation and

01:44:01.935 --> 01:44:02.469
chairman Gloria thank you for

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:06.139
the opportunity to be here --

01:44:06.206 --> 01:44:08.041
Our vision at that send you

thriving Ste was safe and stable

01:44:14.314 --> 01:44:14.915
place that we can afford to call

01:44:14.982 --> 01:44:16.016
home.

01:44:16.083 --> 01:44:18.085
And of course the reason is that

01:44:18.151 --> 01:44:18.752
a safe place to call home is the

01:44:18.819 --> 01:44:20.487
basis for all other successful

01:44:20.554 --> 01:44:22.122
outcomes in life --

populations we primarily seek to

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:31.965

01:44:54.287 --> 01:44:56.323
When we talk about --

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.923
Housing and and even talking

01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:58.091
about middle income or moderate

01:44:58.158 --> 01:45:00.127
income housing it's important we

01:45:00.193 --> 01:45:00.761
accurately identify our housing

01:45:00.827 --> 01:45:02.362
production we we definitely have

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:04.197
a good handle on the demand side.

01:45:04.264 --> 01:45:06.333
Of housing but not so much on

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.235
the supply and when I talk about

01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:08.635
that is really --

01:45:08.702 --> 01:45:10.337
Both production in existing

01:45:10.404 --> 01:45:12.773
supply.

01:45:12.839 --> 01:45:13.440
When I is this is a slight that

01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:16.143
I often uses for may be familiar

01:45:16.209 --> 01:45:16.443
to folks --

01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:16.777
That we Chen.

01:45:16.843 --> 01:45:18.378
Housing production in the region

01:45:18.445 --> 01:45:20.480
from 200-032-2000 thirteen so in

01:45:20.547 --> 01:45:22.482
that decade this is segregated

01:45:22.549 --> 01:45:24.084
by -- That

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:24.718
the categories the Reno looks at

01:45:24.785 --> 01:45:28.555
low as you can see according to

01:45:28.622 --> 01:45:30.057
this truck with over produced in

01:45:30.123 --> 01:45:30.590
the above moderate income

01:45:30.657 --> 01:45:32.059
bracket --

01:45:32.125 --> 01:45:34.294
In in moderate income and low

01:45:34.361 --> 01:45:34.861
income we produce roughly a

01:45:34.928 --> 01:45:36.496
fifth of of the the demand over

01:45:36.563 --> 01:45:38.198
that period of time --

01:45:38.265 --> 01:45:40.400
Fume important take was first of

01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:40.600
all.

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:42.235
It's not exactly accurate we

01:45:42.302 --> 01:45:44.304
will narratively we know this is

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:46.306
roughly true the at the data

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:48.008
that is gathered about moderate

01:45:48.075 --> 01:45:50.010
income housing is not very

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:50.610
consistent across the state.

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:52.412
And that's that's a problem it's

01:45:52.479 --> 01:45:52.946
it's easier for a lot of

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:54.381
municipalities merely claim

01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:56.149
above moderate housing rather

01:45:56.216 --> 01:45:56.783
than go through methodology to

01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:58.452
prove that they have produced

01:45:58.518 --> 01:46:00.187
moderate income housing.

01:46:00.253 --> 01:46:02.222
Please numbers very and I

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:02.723
believe there seventeen

01:46:02.789 --> 01:46:04.257
jurisdictions in the state that

01:46:04.324 --> 01:46:04.825
go through a methodology to

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:06.426
actually identify the moderate

01:46:06.493 --> 01:46:08.328
income production it's easier

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:08.995
just to sweep it all up into the

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:10.063
top.

01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:12.065
So that's there's a problem

01:46:12.132 --> 01:46:12.599
there in terms of actually

01:46:12.666 --> 01:46:14.000
knowing what we produced.

01:46:14.067 --> 01:46:16.236
It still the narrative is still

01:46:16.303 --> 01:46:18.538
roughly true though we we we

01:46:18.605 --> 01:46:18.939
believe that --

01:46:19.005 --> 01:46:20.340
There is a lack of supply in a

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:22.042
moderate income housing bracket

01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:22.642
and that it has disastrous

01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:28.281
effects on the lower income --

01:46:28.348 --> 01:46:30.183
Because residents because those

01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:30.884
folks who are moderate income do

01:46:30.951 --> 01:46:32.085
not go without housing they make

01:46:32.152 --> 01:46:32.753
choices for housing that maybe.

01:46:32.819 --> 01:46:34.287
Sub optimum for them maybe a

01:46:34.354 --> 01:46:34.855
neighbor they don't want a

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:36.423
smaller place apartment versus a

01:46:36.490 --> 01:46:38.058
home with moderate income

01:46:38.125 --> 01:46:38.625
households do not go without

01:46:38.692 --> 01:46:40.193
housing.

01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:42.195
Are they simply by up or rent up

01:46:42.262 --> 01:46:42.763
the housing that has been

01:46:42.829 --> 01:46:44.431
occupied by lower income.

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:46.066
Individuals --

01:46:46.133 --> 01:46:48.335
Next I think so what's important

01:46:48.401 --> 01:46:50.137
is also recognizing the

01:46:50.203 --> 01:46:50.771
differential impact the housing

01:46:50.837 --> 01:46:52.139
costs have a different income

01:46:52.205 --> 01:46:53.974
levels as I've just described --

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:56.076
And I'm gonna school through

01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:56.710
some of the income sites really

01:46:56.777 --> 01:46:58.011
quickly because the late hour

01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:00.180
but when you look at what 60% MI

01:47:00.247 --> 01:47:02.048
is and who that serve you can

01:47:02.115 --> 01:47:04.417
see that these are critical

01:47:04.484 --> 01:47:04.951
members of our community.

01:47:05.018 --> 01:47:06.186
When you look at what the wage

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:08.288
went gap is we we look at --

01:47:08.355 --> 01:47:10.123
The first two partial with what

01:47:10.190 --> 01:47:10.757
you need to for a one bedroom

01:47:10.824 --> 01:47:12.292
and what is needed to forty two

01:47:12.359 --> 01:47:14.127
bedroom and then you look at

01:47:14.194 --> 01:47:14.761
folks below 80% and mind what

01:47:14.828 --> 01:47:16.129
they're making.

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:16.763
And you can see that there's a

01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:19.933
significant gap for us

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.068
professions that are we consider

01:47:22.135 --> 01:47:22.702
middle class in any case as a

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:24.304
legal secretary a police officer --

01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:35.982
Nurse should all be obviously

01:47:36.049 --> 01:47:38.318
able to afford to live here.

01:47:38.385 --> 01:47:40.120
At about.

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:42.255
AM my the gap less severe

01:47:42.322 --> 01:47:44.024
obviously honest.

01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:48.094
Which is a this.

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:48.728
Are in this sort of ties into

01:47:48.795 --> 01:47:50.497
really a when a rental gap --

01:47:50.564 --> 01:47:52.265
Affordability gap when you look

01:47:52.332 --> 01:47:52.933
at somebody police officers 60%

01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:54.367
a mind that is a starting salary --

01:47:54.434 --> 01:47:56.002
Minus over time and you can see

01:47:56.069 --> 01:47:56.703
that even a police officers over

01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:57.337
paying five hundred and forty a

01:47:57.404 --> 01:47:58.438
month typically on average --

01:47:58.505 --> 01:48:00.473
For a real local department the

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:02.075
the apartment costs for market

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:02.642
point realty advisors --

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:04.344
Is is obtained through October

01:48:04.411 --> 01:48:06.146
nineteen Tribune story you can

01:48:06.213 --> 01:48:08.048
see that.

01:48:08.114 --> 01:48:08.715
The gap is less severe as you

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:11.084
move up the income scale there's

01:48:11.151 --> 01:48:12.285
no no surprises there with

01:48:12.352 --> 01:48:14.287
important quantify those things.

01:48:14.354 --> 01:48:16.122
Is important to note that we

01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:18.024
have both a supply problem and a

01:48:18.091 --> 01:48:18.358
use problem.

01:48:18.425 --> 01:48:20.327
And by that I mean not all the

01:48:20.393 --> 01:48:24.197
housing in the region's and this

01:48:24.264 --> 01:48:26.800
is a recent analysis that Sanday

01:48:26.867 --> 01:48:27.400
did the show the 5% of the

01:48:27.467 --> 01:48:30.136
entire market is off.

01:48:30.203 --> 01:48:30.403
Market --

01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:31.037
And that includes a variety of

01:48:31.104 --> 01:48:32.405
things that include of vacation

01:48:32.472 --> 01:48:36.109
rentals vacation homes --

01:48:36.176 --> 01:48:36.776
Impressive occasion rental short

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:38.078
term vacation rentals rental

01:48:38.144 --> 01:48:38.378
homes -- In

01:48:38.445 --> 01:48:40.413
many cases cash depositories for

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:40.914
foreign nationals were

01:48:40.981 --> 01:48:42.215
protecting assets in US

01:48:42.282 --> 01:48:44.217
denominated real estate US

01:48:44.284 --> 01:48:46.152
dollars --

01:48:46.219 --> 01:48:47.954
With that's why we're producing

01:48:48.021 --> 01:48:48.555
hundred and 30% of the above

01:48:48.622 --> 01:48:50.357
moderate income housing is

01:48:50.423 --> 01:48:50.957
region's because we're serving

01:48:51.024 --> 01:48:52.425
and national and international

01:48:52.492 --> 01:48:53.894
market in that sector.

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.962
But that's 5% is a crucial

01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:56.630
number because it is we we may

01:48:56.696 --> 01:49:00.033
work well recall 5% vacancy rate

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:00.667
is considered a healthy vacancy

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:02.135
rate in the region at which

01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:04.004
landlords and tenants have equal

01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.404
bargaining power.

01:49:04.471 --> 01:49:08.008
Weirdest two point 823% vacancy

01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:08.642
rate right now with which means

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:10.343
it's total in the landlords

01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:12.379
favor and with 5% of the housing

01:49:12.445 --> 01:49:23.256
market pulled off if even half

01:49:23.323 --> 01:49:23.723
of that were actually

01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:24.391
potentially available for rental

01:49:24.457 --> 01:49:26.226
we could turn this into a

01:49:26.293 --> 01:49:26.860
renter's market just by making

01:49:26.927 --> 01:49:28.061
that housing available.

01:49:28.128 --> 01:49:30.263
This is the actual numbers that

01:49:30.330 --> 01:49:30.797
were produced mesa however

01:49:30.864 --> 01:49:34.434
stepped up blessed with on the

01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:37.938
sand. For producing these

01:49:38.004 --> 01:49:38.371
numbers reports --

01:49:38.438 --> 01:49:40.240
What would we be looking forward --

01:49:40.307 --> 01:49:42.142
To adequate site standards --

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:44.010
We should be requiring --

01:49:44.077 --> 01:49:44.377
In with arena.

01:49:44.444 --> 01:49:46.346
Must identify there's land

01:49:46.413 --> 01:49:46.880
available but it doesn't

01:49:46.947 --> 01:49:48.081
actually have to be is on for

01:49:48.148 --> 01:49:48.748
housing when is included in our

01:49:48.815 --> 01:49:50.116
housing element has to be put

01:49:50.183 --> 01:49:50.750
the potential has to be there.

01:49:50.817 --> 01:49:52.252
But I think we might ask

01:49:52.319 --> 01:49:54.087
municipalities to half subject

01:49:54.154 --> 01:49:56.222
because that is how we're going

01:49:56.289 --> 01:49:56.856
to get to buy right development

01:49:56.923 --> 01:50:00.060
in these municipalities.

01:50:00.126 --> 01:50:02.162
We also need I think to increase

01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:04.331
our improve our data collection

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:05.966
requirements --

01:50:06.032 --> 01:50:06.599
Improve protocols by which we

01:50:06.666 --> 01:50:08.301
identify what price point a

01:50:08.368 --> 01:50:10.170
product is entering the market

01:50:10.236 --> 01:50:10.403
place.

01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:12.038
And also to better understand --

01:50:12.105 --> 01:50:14.174
The loss of naturally affordable

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.076
housing because we we talk a lot

01:50:16.142 --> 01:50:16.743
about expiring affordability and

01:50:16.810 --> 01:50:18.311
that refers only to that which

01:50:18.378 --> 01:50:20.080
is covenant at that which is

01:50:20.146 --> 01:50:22.048
supported by public subsidy.

01:50:22.115 --> 01:50:22.716
The vast majority of court in

01:50:22.782 --> 01:50:24.317
court affordable housing we have

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:26.152
lost in the last decades has

01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:26.753
been naturally for the housing

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:28.121
bid up.

01:50:28.188 --> 01:50:30.290
A rented up by middle income

01:50:30.357 --> 01:50:32.025
residents like look at north

01:50:32.092 --> 01:50:34.227
park in city heights of classic

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:36.096
examples of this --

01:50:36.162 --> 01:50:38.331
And I think it's it's would also

01:50:38.398 --> 01:50:38.999
the state would help was better

01:50:39.065 --> 01:50:40.066
identify when speculative

01:50:40.133 --> 01:50:40.700
pressures are driving up costs

01:50:40.767 --> 01:50:42.335
because even in the discussion

01:50:42.402 --> 01:50:44.371
about rent control the goal

01:50:44.437 --> 01:50:44.904
there is to is to remove

01:50:44.971 --> 01:50:46.373
speculation from the market

01:50:46.439 --> 01:50:48.174
place not to read not.

01:50:48.241 --> 01:50:50.010
To not to impair production and

01:50:50.076 --> 01:50:50.610
not to to degrade the housing

01:50:50.677 --> 01:50:54.147
spot but to take the speculative --

01:50:54.214 --> 01:50:56.016
Interests --

01:50:56.082 --> 01:50:56.649
To reduce those impacts on the

01:50:56.716 --> 01:50:58.184
actual price of housing is a

01:50:58.251 --> 01:50:59.953
number of ways that speculation

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:00.587
comes in which is short term

01:51:00.653 --> 01:51:02.355
vacation rentals as one sure

01:51:02.422 --> 01:51:04.057
speculation were investors come

01:51:04.124 --> 01:51:05.992
and take an existing building.

01:51:06.059 --> 01:51:06.659
By for high price and rented up

01:51:06.726 --> 01:51:08.495
at a higher rate no new housing

01:51:08.561 --> 01:51:10.463
is being produced but the rents

01:51:10.530 --> 01:51:12.399
can sometimes go a 50% or more.

01:51:12.465 --> 01:51:14.634
Up it's worth pointing out what

01:51:14.701 --> 01:51:16.136
a type of data collection also

01:51:16.202 --> 01:51:16.770
some numbers been thrown around

01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:19.939
about housing production costs --

01:51:20.006 --> 01:51:22.208
My look misinterpret

01:51:22.275 --> 01:51:26.179
recollections of the how for the

01:51:26.246 --> 01:51:28.281
past five years so that's below

01:51:28.348 --> 01:51:30.116
some of the the larger numbers --

01:51:30.183 --> 01:51:31.885
I also know examples --

01:51:31.951 --> 01:51:32.452
Interfaith housing I was St

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:34.220
seniors was about two hundred

01:51:34.287 --> 01:51:34.821
and forty thousand a unit and

01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:36.456
the whole reason there was the

01:51:36.523 --> 01:51:37.957
land was banked.

01:51:38.024 --> 01:51:39.993
In these whistles bottle low

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:40.660
price when we look at solutions

01:51:40.727 --> 01:51:42.262
land banking public land trust

01:51:42.328 --> 01:51:44.197
and other things of come earlier

01:51:44.264 --> 01:51:46.166
today certainly have some real

01:51:46.232 --> 01:51:48.134
value -- So

01:51:48.201 --> 01:51:48.735
another thing I would I would

01:51:48.802 --> 01:51:50.403
recommend that we do maybe it

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:52.038
legislatively it's to look at

01:51:52.105 --> 01:51:52.739
some off market housing measures.

01:51:52.806 --> 01:51:54.307
Enabling legislation --

01:51:54.374 --> 01:51:56.376
That would make it easier for

01:51:56.443 --> 01:51:58.144
municipality to control short

01:51:58.211 --> 01:51:58.711
term vacation rentals maybe

01:51:58.778 --> 01:52:00.513
provide bumper guard so that

01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:02.082
it's not a considered a taking

01:52:02.148 --> 01:52:04.050
but makes it easier because we

01:52:04.117 --> 01:52:04.651
all well know what happened

01:52:04.717 --> 01:52:06.152
locally.

01:52:06.219 --> 01:52:06.853
And it is a terrible problem and

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.254
you see speculation going into

01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:10.090
that as well people over pay for

01:52:10.156 --> 01:52:12.058
properties because they can

01:52:12.125 --> 01:52:12.692
anticipate that they can use in

01:52:12.759 --> 01:52:14.094
the short term vacation rentals

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.129
rather typical rental --

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:16.729
We also could be looking at

01:52:16.796 --> 01:52:18.531
second home mortgage interest

01:52:18.598 --> 01:52:20.300
deductions that was looked at

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:22.202
previously as with financing --

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:22.836
You what what what we're doing

01:52:22.902 --> 01:52:24.437
is we are subsidizing people

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:26.339
have to homes and our people

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:28.208
right now who have none and I

01:52:28.274 --> 01:52:28.842
think we need to be looking at

01:52:28.908 --> 01:52:29.109
whether.

01:52:29.175 --> 01:52:30.310
The purpose of mortgage home

01:52:30.376 --> 01:52:32.112
interest deduction --

01:52:32.178 --> 01:52:32.712
It inflates the cost of the

01:52:32.779 --> 01:52:34.247
stock and it it --

01:52:34.314 --> 01:52:36.516
In incentivize people to on more

01:52:36.583 --> 01:52:39.986
housing than they actually use --

01:52:40.053 --> 01:52:43.990
Finally I would say --

01:52:44.057 --> 01:52:44.624
In conclusion the development of

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:48.128
it at go to relieve the pressure

01:52:48.194 --> 01:52:48.728
on lower income households.

01:52:48.795 --> 01:52:50.497
At portions of this market are

01:52:50.563 --> 01:52:52.198
never going to function for all

01:52:52.265 --> 01:52:54.067
residents even in the moderate

01:52:54.134 --> 01:52:54.667
income you talk to developers

01:52:54.734 --> 01:52:56.102
how low could you actually bring

01:52:56.169 --> 01:52:56.402
the price.

01:52:56.469 --> 01:52:58.438
They struggle to so that they

01:52:58.505 --> 01:52:59.072
can bring something to the one

01:52:59.139 --> 01:53:00.106
twenty written.

01:53:00.173 --> 01:53:02.342
1100% AM might with just natural

01:53:02.408 --> 01:53:04.210
market forces all the

01:53:04.277 --> 01:53:04.811
deregulation in the world I'd

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:06.479
love to solve that problem I

01:53:06.546 --> 01:53:07.080
believe it's going to take a

01:53:07.147 --> 01:53:08.548
public intervention funds or

01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:10.116
other special considerations.

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:10.750
And if we do that we need to

01:53:10.817 --> 01:53:12.452
make sure that housing stays in

01:53:12.519 --> 01:53:14.387
that housing costs bracket that

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:16.222
we don't simply put housing out

01:53:16.289 --> 01:53:16.823
there that is then flipped.

01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:18.324
And and rises to a two new

01:53:18.391 --> 01:53:20.160
higher level --

01:53:20.226 --> 01:53:22.095
I with other things we could be

01:53:22.162 --> 01:53:22.428
doing is --

01:53:22.495 --> 01:53:24.497
Local revenue sources we need

01:53:24.564 --> 01:53:26.266
local revenues as other regions

01:53:26.332 --> 01:53:28.001
have done.

01:53:28.067 --> 01:53:28.635
Apps lowering the threshold for

01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:30.336
housing bonds and expanding the

01:53:30.403 --> 01:53:32.205
breadth of application for those --

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:34.007
Better coordination

01:53:34.073 --> 01:53:34.641
transportation and land use of

01:53:34.707 --> 01:53:35.975
how we spent transportation

01:53:36.042 --> 01:53:38.244
dollars that in support of

01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:38.711
housing production.

01:53:38.778 --> 01:53:40.380
When since US and transmit three

01:53:40.446 --> 01:53:42.215
comes along let's require that

01:53:42.282 --> 01:53:44.250
these funds be spent things like

01:53:44.317 --> 01:53:44.918
that half road expansion Mister

01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:46.386
wearing was talking about could

01:53:46.452 --> 01:53:47.987
very well have been a regional

01:53:48.054 --> 01:53:50.156
cost that was born not something

01:53:50.223 --> 01:53:51.991
apply to the individual units --

01:53:52.058 --> 01:53:52.692
And I do think that the creation

01:53:52.759 --> 01:53:54.327
funding of land trust could be

01:53:54.394 --> 01:53:55.895
critical if we create a land

01:53:55.962 --> 01:53:56.529
trust the you have to continue

01:53:56.596 --> 01:53:58.464
to feed it money to be able to

01:53:58.531 --> 01:53:58.932
grow its its mission.

01:53:58.998 --> 01:54:00.366
But it is a way of making sure

01:54:00.433 --> 01:54:11.511
the housing comes on the market

01:54:11.578 --> 01:54:12.045
below market.

01:54:12.111 --> 01:54:18.051
And stays there overtime others

01:54:18.117 --> 01:54:20.119
are a number of ideas we have.

01:54:20.186 --> 01:54:22.088
Time I will let.

01:54:22.155 --> 01:54:22.355
Find him.

01:54:22.422 --> 01:54:26.059
To be in.

01:54:26.125 --> 01:54:27.927
So my friend Helen I we

01:54:27.994 --> 01:54:28.461
California be where a new

01:54:28.528 --> 01:54:30.230
housing advocacy organization --

01:54:30.296 --> 01:54:32.265
That advocates for state

01:54:32.332 --> 01:54:34.133
legislation to make California

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:34.734
affordable and accessible --

01:54:34.801 --> 01:54:36.002
For everyone --

01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:38.104
Insuperable races but was like

01:54:38.171 --> 01:54:38.771
we believe that California's for

01:54:38.838 --> 01:54:40.006
everyone --

01:54:40.073 --> 01:54:41.941
Whether a migrant from Ohio El

01:54:42.008 --> 01:54:44.043
Salvador or if your right here

01:54:44.110 --> 01:54:44.444
from San Diego --

01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:46.145
We believe that everyone.

01:54:46.212 --> 01:54:46.779
Should be able to achieve their

01:54:46.846 --> 01:54:48.014
full potential --

01:54:48.081 --> 01:54:48.281
Enjoy --

01:54:48.348 --> 01:54:50.383
Quality schools access to good

01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:52.118
jobs in safe secure a formal

01:54:52.185 --> 01:54:53.953
housing --

01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:55.989
Unfortunately as piping was --

01:54:56.055 --> 01:54:56.522
Mentioned this sort of

01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:58.224
California dream has become a

01:54:58.291 --> 01:54:58.725
California nightmare for

01:54:58.791 --> 01:55:00.260
millions of us are for to many

01:55:00.326 --> 01:55:02.295
Californians are burdened with a

01:55:02.362 --> 01:55:04.097
very high rents that just keep

01:55:04.163 --> 01:55:04.497
on increasing --

01:55:04.564 --> 01:55:08.434
And have no hope at achieving

01:55:08.501 --> 01:55:12.038
their dream of Californians

01:55:12.105 --> 01:55:12.705
cities have made it more costly

01:55:12.772 --> 01:55:14.207
time consuming.

01:55:14.274 --> 01:55:16.242
Difficult in a legal to build

01:55:16.309 --> 01:55:18.177
enough housing to keep up with

01:55:18.244 --> 01:55:18.611
population growth.

01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:20.213
During the nineteen sixties

01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:20.780
seventies and eighties Los

01:55:20.847 --> 01:55:22.415
Angeles for instance made it

01:55:22.482 --> 01:55:24.083
illegal to book apartment

01:55:24.150 --> 01:55:24.717
buildings and condos in most

01:55:24.784 --> 01:55:26.452
their neighborhoods including

01:55:26.519 --> 01:55:28.187
the neighborhoods where they had

01:55:28.254 --> 01:55:30.089
long been a permitted.

01:55:30.156 --> 01:55:30.690
The result is that LA zone

01:55:30.757 --> 01:55:32.458
capacity went from ten million

01:55:32.525 --> 01:55:34.093
it to three point nine million

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:36.029
even as the population increased

01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:36.262
by 40%.

01:55:36.329 --> 01:55:38.231
Spiking rents rising

01:55:38.298 --> 01:55:39.932
homelessness and lower rates of

01:55:39.999 --> 01:55:40.600
homeownership were predicted and

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:42.201
unfortunately all came to a

01:55:42.268 --> 01:55:43.970
fruition.

01:55:44.037 --> 01:55:46.005
So short when a crisis --

01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:48.107
And in a crisis leaders need to

01:55:48.174 --> 01:55:50.109
take decisive action to solve

01:55:50.176 --> 01:55:50.443
the problem.

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:52.111
So we need to be done well as

01:55:52.178 --> 01:55:54.013
several independent analysts

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.948
have suggested we need to build

01:55:56.015 --> 01:55:56.582
three point five million homes

01:55:56.649 --> 01:55:57.984
within that.

01:55:58.051 --> 01:56:00.019
The next a decade in in order to

01:56:00.086 --> 01:56:00.687
do that the state legislature to

01:56:00.753 --> 01:56:05.925
pass a sweet a policy changes to

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:06.526
get California Boeing again.

01:56:06.592 --> 01:56:07.994
First.

01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:08.661
The legislature must reverse the

01:56:08.728 --> 01:56:10.296
down zoning of the past in.

01:56:10.363 --> 01:56:12.065
Legalize apartment buildings and

01:56:12.131 --> 01:56:12.665
missing little housing areas

01:56:12.732 --> 01:56:14.033
well served by transit and jobs.

01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:16.202
The state should build on the

01:56:16.269 --> 01:56:17.970
success of a success rate one

01:56:18.037 --> 01:56:20.106
unit of legislation and help

01:56:20.173 --> 01:56:20.640
increase our construction

01:56:20.707 --> 01:56:21.107
throughout the state.

01:56:21.174 --> 01:56:22.442
Also known as easy use granny

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:26.145
flats are cheaply built around

01:56:26.212 --> 01:56:28.281
as long as owners of regulations

01:56:28.348 --> 01:56:30.583
don't get in the way.

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:31.217
The state must streamlined the

01:56:31.284 --> 01:56:32.318
production of housing that

01:56:32.385 --> 01:56:33.986
complies with the rules of local

01:56:34.053 --> 01:56:36.155
governments. Forty years ago the

01:56:36.222 --> 01:56:38.191
state passed the permit

01:56:38.257 --> 01:56:38.591
streamlining act.

01:56:38.658 --> 01:56:39.992
Yet permits or anything but

01:56:40.059 --> 01:56:40.360
streamlined --

01:56:40.426 --> 01:56:42.228
It's long past time to close --

01:56:42.295 --> 01:56:44.464
Those of the that the state must

01:56:44.530 --> 01:56:46.366
also curtail the ever increasing --

01:56:46.432 --> 01:56:48.368
Fees that local governments and

01:56:48.434 --> 01:56:50.103
special used districts impose a

01:56:50.169 --> 01:56:52.105
new homebuilding as previous

01:56:52.171 --> 01:56:52.638
palace and mentioned we're

01:56:52.705 --> 01:56:56.142
taxing we most need new homes.

01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:56.642
Which ensures that --

01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:58.344
Homes are only built at a time

01:56:58.411 --> 01:57:00.313
when prices are very high.

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.081
At the state passed a bill

01:57:02.148 --> 01:57:03.983
called the mitigation fee after

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:06.018
thirty years ago but it too is.

01:57:06.085 --> 01:57:06.652
Riddled with the house of the

01:57:06.719 --> 01:57:08.287
polls that and and the speed

01:57:08.354 --> 01:57:09.989
dressed --

01:57:10.056 --> 01:57:14.026
And I just really want to hit on

01:57:14.093 --> 01:57:15.995
appointed early panelists made

01:57:16.062 --> 01:57:16.295
[inaudible]

01:57:16.362 --> 01:57:20.032
Benefit everyone.

01:57:20.099 --> 01:57:20.400
For everyone --

01:57:20.466 --> 01:57:22.168
If if you think of that

01:57:22.235 --> 01:57:24.203
civilization is a worthy goal if

01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:24.871
you think that social democracy

01:57:24.937 --> 01:57:26.439
is a is a worthy goal than it's

01:57:26.506 --> 01:57:28.141
worth paying --

01:57:28.207 --> 01:57:28.741
For you don't decades ago of

01:57:28.808 --> 01:57:30.343
former housing activists

01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:32.011
recognize that these impact fees

01:57:32.078 --> 01:57:34.046
reform exclusionary zoning.

01:57:34.113 --> 01:57:34.714
I challenge people to go back to

01:57:34.781 --> 01:57:36.549
the man that would like nineteen

01:57:36.616 --> 01:57:38.217
seventy one yellow review

01:57:38.284 --> 01:57:40.319
article that Paul Devon off road --

01:57:40.386 --> 01:57:42.021
What the tiny of advocacy

01:57:42.088 --> 01:57:44.056
planning he's calling out --

01:57:44.123 --> 01:57:44.690
It infrastructure fees on on

01:57:44.757 --> 01:57:46.225
homes as being exclusionary and

01:57:46.292 --> 01:57:48.227
locking out lower and middle

01:57:48.294 --> 01:57:50.229
income people because it does --

01:57:50.296 --> 01:57:52.365
Does he like to really address

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:52.665
the crisis.

01:57:52.732 --> 01:57:54.300
California needs to take a page

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:55.968
from.

01:57:56.035 --> 01:57:58.137
The previous time in history

01:57:58.204 --> 01:58:00.006
with is a national emergency in

01:58:00.072 --> 01:58:00.573
over two and bill temporary

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:02.308
workforce housing to house the

01:58:02.375 --> 01:58:04.143
carpenters labors and trades

01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:06.012
people that we will need. To

01:58:06.078 --> 01:58:12.118
build a California tomorrow --

01:58:12.185 --> 01:58:14.120
We also need to dismantle local

01:58:14.187 --> 01:58:16.088
governments of the revenue at

01:58:16.155 --> 01:58:16.656
that they need to adequately

01:58:16.722 --> 01:58:18.357
address the needs of low income

01:58:18.424 --> 01:58:18.691
Californians.

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:20.626
On twenty twenty there'll be a

01:58:20.693 --> 01:58:22.028
ballot initiative --

01:58:22.094 --> 01:58:22.495
To eliminate property

01:58:22.562 --> 01:58:24.096
protections for many commercial

01:58:24.163 --> 01:58:24.697
properties this measure could

01:58:24.764 --> 01:58:26.432
race at six to ten billion

01:58:26.499 --> 01:58:27.967
dollars a year --

01:58:28.034 --> 01:58:30.269
That's a lot of money and I am a

01:58:30.336 --> 01:58:31.938
huge proponent of it.

01:58:32.004 --> 01:58:33.940
And I also think to your point.

01:58:34.006 --> 01:58:34.574
That we need to take a look at

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:36.342
the more at the state mortgage

01:58:36.409 --> 01:58:38.144
interest deduction --

01:58:38.211 --> 01:58:40.346
It many studies have shown that

01:58:40.413 --> 01:58:42.281
it does not actually promote

01:58:42.348 --> 01:58:43.916
first time --

01:58:43.983 --> 01:58:44.450
Homeownership the the tax

01:58:44.517 --> 01:58:46.385
savings is to capitalize into

01:58:46.452 --> 01:58:48.154
the cost of housing about making

01:58:48.221 --> 01:58:50.089
it a more expensive and the fact

01:58:50.156 --> 01:58:51.958
that we haven't second homes.

01:58:52.024 --> 01:58:52.225
Is just.

01:58:52.291 --> 01:58:53.960
The criminal.

01:58:54.026 --> 01:58:55.995
We need to hear that --

01:58:56.062 --> 01:58:58.097
I but you know we spend billions

01:58:58.164 --> 01:59:00.333
of dollars every year on the MIT

01:59:00.399 --> 01:59:00.566
select.

01:59:00.633 --> 01:59:04.170
What would it just California

01:59:04.237 --> 01:59:04.804
budget look like I mean not in

01:59:04.871 --> 01:59:08.441
the pre it's of legislation --

01:59:08.508 --> 01:59:10.243
And if we were really serious

01:59:10.309 --> 01:59:12.078
about -- And

01:59:12.144 --> 01:59:14.013
me and then the needs --

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:14.614
Of a Limón Californians than

01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:16.048
what we will be spending five

01:59:16.115 --> 01:59:16.682
billion dollars a year on the

01:59:16.749 --> 01:59:20.019
mortgage interest at a deduction --

01:59:20.086 --> 01:59:21.988
And so I just close by saying

01:59:22.054 --> 01:59:37.069
that our our housing challenges
