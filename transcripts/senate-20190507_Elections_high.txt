CENTER NIELSEN IS HERE -- AND AS A SUB COMMITTEE WILL ENTERTAIN THE FIRST AUTHOR AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS SENATOR HILL WHO WAS HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THIS SHOULD BE -- SCA. THREE GOOD MORNING -- SCA THREE AT ITS CORE IS ABOUT EQUITY AND FAIRNESS HE PROPOSES TO MODIFY THE PROPERTY TAX INHERITANCE EXCLUSION LAW PROSPECTIVELY. TO REQUIRE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN THAT INHERITED FROM A HOME TO ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE HOME IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR PROP THIRTEEN BASE YEAR. AND TO AVOID REASSESSMENT. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT ALLOWS PARENTS TO LEAVE THEIR HOME TO A CHILD. AND NOT HAVE THAT HOME REASSESSED. YOUNG PROFESSIONALS AND STRUGGLING FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS ALL HAVE TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES ON THE FULL VALUE OF THEIR HOMES. IT SEEMS BLATANTLY UNFAIR THAT SOMEONE COULD INHERIT AHOME THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO LIVE IN AND PAY A FRACTION OF PROPERTY TAXES. THAT THEIR NEIGHBORS TO ADDRESS CA THREE IF A CHILD GRANDCHILD INHERIT THE PROPERTY WANTS TO KEEP THEIR PARENTS GRANDPARENTS ASSESSED VALUE FOR PROPERTY TAXES. IT WOULD HAVE TO LIVE IN THE HOME AS THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENCE WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OF INHERITING THE PROPERTY. IS ADDITIONAL TWELVE MONTHS ALLOWS THE CHILD OR GRANDCHILD TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS AND DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO MOVE INTO THE HOME IF THEY DECIDE TO RENT OUT THE HOME IT WOULD. IT WOULD BE RECESSED TO MARKET VALUE. AND THE PROPERTY TAXES WOULD BE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY. PROP FIFTY EIGHT WHICH PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WAS DESIGNED TO KEEP A HOME IN THE FAMILY AND ALLOW CHILDREN TO BENEFIT FROM THE ASSESSED VALUE WHEN PARENTS DIE. AND NOT BE IMMEDIATELY FACED WITH THE EXORBITANT PROPERTY TAX INCREASE. HOWEVER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THIS EXCLUSION WHEN THOSE THAT INHERIT PROPERTIES ARE RENTING THEM OUT FOR INCOME AND PROFIT. THOSE THAT BENEFIT FROM A RENTAL HOME FROM A PROPERTY THEY INHERITED SHOULD HAVE TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES LOCAL POLICE. FIRE LIBRARIES PARKS ETCETERA ARE ALREADY FINANCIALLY STRUGGLING ACROSS THE STATE. AND SHOULDN'T SUFFER UNNECESSARILY MORE BECAUSE OF THIS INHERITANCE EXCLUSION LAW -- I DO HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- WITNESSES PORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WOULD CLOSE THIS IMPORTANT LOOPHOLE -- THAT WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES WHICH IN TURN MAKE THE GUARANTEED -- PROP NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES -- GO FURTHER FOUR SCHOOLS -- CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED FORTY FOURTH IN THE NATION WHEN YOU FACTOR IN INFLATION AND COST OF LIVING OUR SCHOOLS ARE TRACK ARE STRUGGLING THIS PROVIDES A MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES THAT'S GONNA HAVE A AND A MAJOR IMPACT ON SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT MISTER WOLF IS WAITING TO BE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE FIREFIGHTERS WHICH WOULD TRADITIONALLY FINDER SELLS ON THESE ISSUES BUT A AND B. HAVE THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. A PROPERTY TAX IS A VERY STABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND IS THE AUTHOR AND SUPPORTER STATED I DON'T THINK ANYONE CONTEMPLATED THAT THIS WOULD BE A WAY THAT -- REVENUES WILL BE DRAINED FROM SUPPORTING THOSE VITAL SERVICES SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. HIGHLAND BEHALF OF THE SCHOOLS ARE SOUNDS FINANCES SUPPORT THANK YOU. ABLE TO JAIL ON BEHALF OF SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING DANIELLE CANDLE KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION ALIGNING OUR COMMENTS WITH OUR COLLEAGUE FROM CALIFORNIA TAX CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THAT THAT WASN'T FREUDIAN WASN'T. ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SINGLE OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THOSE IN OPPOSITION YES MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAG MORNING AND MISS BAM IT DID ASSUME CORRECTLY DAVID WOLF WITH THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED. UNFORTUNATELY THE SCA THREE JUST A COUPLE POINTS MEMBERS TO RAISE WITH THIS BILL THIS MORNING NUMBER ONE THIS IS A TAX INCREASE. UNQUESTIONABLY UNDENIABLY THIS IS A TAX INCREASE OUR OPINION ON THIS BILL MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IF IT WAS TIED TO YOU PORTABILITY IMPROVEMENTS OR IF IT WAS TIED TO AN INCREASE IN THE HOMEOWNERS EXEMPTION -- THAT MADE IT REVENUE NEUTRAL BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THOSE PROVISIONS ARE NOT IN THIS BILL SO IT IS A TAX INCREASE. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THIS YOU KNOW WE ARE CONCERNED BECAUSE PROPERTY OWNERS ALREADY PAYING INCOME TAX ON PROPERTIES AT BAY IT RAN OUT. AND WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT DOUBLE TAXATION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY FOR PROPERTIES THEY RAN OUT UNDER THIS BILL ASSUMING THE CHILD DOESN'T LIVE IN THE HOME THERE WOULD BE A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN PROPERTY TAXES. WE DO BELIEVE THIS WOULD RESULT IN DOUBLE TAXATION AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE DOING THAT AIRBNB TYPE SITUATION SHOULD ALREADY BE PAYING INCOME TAX ON THESE PROPERTIES AND WE THINK. ONE TAXES ENOUGH IN THIS SITUATION SO WE'D ASK FOR AN OVER. THANK YOU MISTER WOLF LE LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM. SO MADAM SECRETARY. NUMBER YOUR NUMBER HERE NIELSEN. NIELSEN HERE HERTZBERG. LABOR LABOR HERE STERN. CAN'T WE HAVE. THANK YOU -- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. THOUGH IT IS AN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS [inaudible] SELLERS -- UPI'VE I'M SORRY SIR LEYVA. DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS THE ABIGAIL LOOKS LIKE SHE'S DOING SO WELL AND I'M VERY HAPPY FOR BOTH OF YOU. SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S MY DAUGHTER SHE'S REFERRING TO IS BORN THREE MONTHS AGO SOME -- WELL CONGRATULATIONS -- FOLLOW HIM ON FACEBOOK YOU GET TO SEE ALL THE UPDATES AND HOW DURABLE SHIAS. WHAT WILL MAYBE WILL BE FORTUNATE THAT? MY GUESS IS YOU'LL BE BACK HERE AGAIN ON SOMETHING ELSE SELF -- IN ABOUT ONE MINUTE HERE. ANOTHER MINUTE SO ON THE MOON -- I DON'T THINK YOUR DAUGHTER APPEAR THOUGH ANOTHER MINUTE -- SO QUESTION FOR FOR CENTER HELL WHAT DO YOU DO HAVE AN ESTIMATE AS TO WHAT WHAT THE REVENUE IMPACT WOULD BE. YOU KNOW I DON'T I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE OF THAT -- I THINK IT'S ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. MISTER WOLF DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE YEAH I MEAN THAT'S ALL THE ESTIMATES THAT I'VE SEEN ON THIS BILL IT'S KIND OF A BALLPARK FIGURE. BILLION IN IN EXPLAIN AGAIN HOW THAT HOW THAT THERE'S DOUBLE TAXATION. WELL AGAIN -- AS STATED FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE YOU KNOW CHILDREN HER RENTING OUT THESE PROPERTIES THEY SHOULD ALREADY BE PAYING INCOME TAX -- ON THE RENTAL DOLLARS THAT THEY RECEIVE -- FROM INDIVIDUALS RENTING OUT THEIR PROPERTIES AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INCREASE IN PROPERTY TAXES HERE -- YOU KNOW UP TO FAIR MARKET VALUE IF THE CHILD'S NOT LIVING IN THE HOME AND THAT COULD BE A DRAMATIC PROPERTY TAX INCREASE SO WE DO VIEW THAT AS DOUBLE TAXATION. IS IS THAT OKAY I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SO THERE WOULD BE DOUBLE TAXATION ON ANY INCOME PROPERTY ROUTE THIRTY INCOME TAX AND PROPERTY TAX SO THAT WOULD APPLY. TO ANY INCOME PROPERTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BUT AGAIN THE POINT IS YOU'RE ALREADY PAYING INCOME TAX ON THE RENTAL ITSELF AND YEAH YOU ARE PAYING OBVIOUSLY PROPERTY TAX ON THE HOME BUT TO THE EXTENT YOUR PROPERTY TAX COULD. CONCEIVABLY DOUBLE OR MORE UNDER THE SPELL DEPENDING ON HOW LONG YOU'VE ON THE PROPERTY -- AND YOU'RE ALREADY PAYING INCOME TAX ON YOUR RENTAL REVENUE YEAH LIKE. STILL TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND WHY THAT'S NOT TRUE OF EVERY SINGLE INCOME PROPERTY BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT FOR NOW -- ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS. NUMBER ALL RIGHT -- IS OUR MOTION -- I'M SORRY SENATOR DO WOULD LIKE YOU KNOW I I WOULD MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. IF I COULD READ THE LOS ANGELES TIMES THERE WAS AN ARTICLE ONE THIS ISSUE FROM -- BECAME UP -- KIND OF A HEADLINE A YEAR OR SO AGO WHEN IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM JOHN TO PAUL THE HEAD OF THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. THE THE FOUNDED BY THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND PROP TIRTEEN SAID. ON THIS ISSUE I BELIEVE THE INHERITANCE BENEFIT CONTINUES TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM LOSING THEIR FAMILY HOMES TO TAXHIKES. BUT EVEN HE WAS SURPRISED THE PROVISION HAVE LED TO SO MANY ERRORS USING THE PROPERTY AS RENTALS HIS QUOTE. THAT WAS PROBABLY NOT IN THE VOTERS MINDS COULD PAUL SAID. I ISSUE RIVAL MEMBERS. THANK YOU SENATOR. I BELIEVE IS A MOTION. MOVED BY CENTER LEYVA. I'M SICK TO VIEW CALL THE ROLL MOTION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS NUMBER. AMBER GUY NIELSEN. NIELSEN NO HERTZBERG. LEYVA. LEYVA AYE STERN STERN I MEASURE KERRY. THANK YOU -- CENTER HELL YOU HAVE ANOTHER MATTER I DO THE FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS SCA -- FIVE WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS VOTERS. HELLO AND HERE COMES THE JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE SCA FIVE WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT VOTERS. TO IMPOSE EXTEND OR INCREASE A PARTIAL TAX WITH 55% VOTER APPROVAL RATHER THAN THE CURRENT TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT DESPITE STATE FUNDING INCREASES. K. THROUGH TWELVE AND HIGHER EDUCATION OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS ARE STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN QUALITY EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. DUE TO THESE PRESSURES AN ESTIMATED TWO THIRDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL HAVE DEFICITS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER. MANY DISTRICTS HAVE HAD TO LAY OFF FOR FOR LOW TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED STAFF AND CUT EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND SERVICES WILL COMMUNITY COLLEGES SERVE THE MOST VULNERABLE STUDENT POPULATIONS. THERE PER STUDENT FUNDING LEVELS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN SEE ISSUE AND UC. PARTIAL TAXES ARE ONE OF THE FEW WAYS THE FEW WAYS THAT LOCAL SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT ARE ABLE TO RAISE REVENUE. AND SUPPLEMENT FUNDS THEY RECEIVE FROM THE STATE BUT THEY REMAIN INACCESSIBLE TO MOST COMMUNITIES GIVEN THE HIGH TWO THIRDS VOTER THRESHOLD. IF A 55% VOTING THRESHOLD HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN IN PLACE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PARTIAL TAX MEASURES WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROVED MORE THAN 80%. OF THE TWENTY SIX LOCAL SCHOOL PARTIAL TAX MEASURES THAT FAILED IN CALIFORNIA. FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WOULD HAVE PASSED IF A SUPERMAJORITY VOTE 55% WERE REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL INSTEAD OF A TWO THIRDS VOTE THRESHOLD. SB FIVE IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT FAIRNESS EXISTING LAW HAS ENABLED A MINORITY OF VOTERS. TO BLOCK EFFORTS TO PROVIDE VITAL LOCAL EDUCATION FUNDING THIS IS CONTRARY. COLLEAGUES THIS IS CONTRARY TO OUR DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES WITH RESPECT WITH RESPECT TO REQUIRING SUPERMAJORITY VOTES. JAMES MADISON WROTE IN THE FEDERALIST PAPERS QUOTE. IT WOULD BE NO LONGER THE MAJORITY THAT WOULD RULE. THE POWER WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE MINORITY. SIMILARLY ALEXANDER HAMILTON WROTE QUOTE WHAT AT FIRST SIGHT IT MAY SEEM A REMEDY. IS IN REALITY A POISON TO GIVE A MINORITY A NEGATIVE UPON THE MAJORITY IS IN ITS TENDENCY. TO SUBJECT THE SENSE OF THE GREATER NUMBER TO THAT OF THE LESSER. SB FIVE RETAINS THE REQUIREMENT FOR SUPERMAJORITY APPROVAL OF LOCAL SCHOOL PARTIAL TAXES BUT THE LEGISLATION CHANGES THE SUPERMAJORITY THRESHOLD. TO A MORE REALISTIC PERCENTAGE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL MEMBERS AND I DO HAVE A WITNESS. THANK YOU PLACENTA AROUND. I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMIC BECAUSE ON AUTHOR I. IN -- CAME TO THE SENATE AS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE SCHOOL BOARD IN MY HOMETOWN IN SANTA MONICA MALIBU. AND WE SERVE DURING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME I WAS ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT I THINK THE STOCK MARKET HIT ITS CRASH AND IN OCTOBER AND I WAS ELECTED IN NOVEMBER. AND ARE IN MY ENTIRE TIME ON THE SCHOOL BOARD WAS SPENT TRYING TO SHORE UP OUR FINANCES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP THE PROGRAMS ALIVE DURING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME. YEAH YOU KNOW THIS WE THIS IS OF TWO THIRDS A VERY HIGH THRESHOLD TO DIFFICULT THRESHOLD TO ME BECAUSE FOR EVERY ONE PERSON WHO DOESN'T WANT. TO I REYES ARE ON TAXES YOU GOT TO FIND TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO VOTE -- TO TO TO RAISE OUR ON TAXES -- IT SCHOOLS ARE NOT DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF CITIES IN TERMS OF REVENUE GENERATION THEY THEY THEY YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T. INCREASED PARKING METER FEES ARE TRANSIT OCCUPANCY FEES OR OR YOU KNOW NEW TAXES ON THE CAR DEALERSHIPS THAT EXIST IN THE IN TOWN THEY CAN'T PUT ON THE BALLOT GENERAL USE TAXES FOR A THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S AT THE DISPOSAL OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ACTUALLY RAISE MONEY LOCALLY THROUGH -- YOU KNOW -- THE AT THE DAY GOES RIGHT TO THE GENERAL FUND IN ORDER TO BUILD NEW BUILDINGS I WILL YOU KNOW THAT IN THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT IS A 55% VOTE FOR BONDS. THAT WAS DONE STATEWIDE A WHILE BACK -- BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUALLY TRY TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS WHAT -- YOU NEED TO OPERATE AN INSTITUTION LIKE A SCHOOL DISTRICT I THE ONLY LOCAL OPTION THAT YOU HAVE BESIDES PRIVATE SECTOR PHILANTHROPY. IS -- IS IS IS THIS PARCEL TAX AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPERFECT SYSTEM. BUT UNTIL WE DO AN OVERHAUL OF THE WAY WE FUND SCHOOLS -- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OF OF THE OF THE MATRIX WE MADE A MAJOR DECISION A COUPLE YEARS AGO TO TOTALLY REVAMP THE WAY WE FINANCE SCHOOLS. IN THE STATE TO HAVE TO REDIRECT FUNDING BASED ON LEVELS OF POVERTY AND POCKETS OF POVERTY AND CONCENTRATIONS OF POVERTY IN. AT THE END THAT THAT THAT LED TO SOME PRETTY DRAMATIC CHANGES TO THE WAY WE FINANCE SCHOOLS. BEFORE I THINK THERE WAS A CONCERN THERE THERE'S A SERIES OF EQUITY CONCERNS ABOUT LOWERING THE YOU KNOW ABOUT RELYING TOO MUCH ON PROPERTY ON BY PERSONAL TAXES BUT WITH WITH THIS NEW VERY STRONGLY REDISTRIBUTIVE MODEL THAT WE HAVE I THINK SOME OF THOSE EQUITY CONCERNS ARE NOW -- MUCH LESSER -- ON THE ON THE ON THE ON THE FRONT BURNER AND AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNE THIS IS A WAY TO GET MORE MONEY INTO OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. AND AND IN IN THE END OF THE DAY -- IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOLDING FAITH BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND SCHOOL BOARD AND SCHOOL DISTRICT ANYONE OF THESE TAXES CAN BE RESCINDED A VOTER COULD NOT VOTERS COULD COULD RISE UP AND AND BE A RECEIPT AND A PARTIAL TAX IF THEY WANT. TO I WITH THE VOTE OF THE POPULATION AND GET A MAJORITY VOTE ACTUALLY -- YOU KNOW BUT BUT BUT BUT IN THE END OF THE DAYIF THE PEOPLE OF THE COMMUNITY WANT TO WANT TO STEP UP AND AND SHOW FAITH IN THEIR SCHOOLS. I AM AT A FEELS OTHERS CONFIDENCE IN THE SCHOOLS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT ME I HAVE ABILITY TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S ACTUALLY ACCESSIBLE -- 55% IS STILL A VERY STRONG MARGIN IT'S NOT AN EASY MARGIN TO MAKE -- BUT IT IT'S MUCH MORE REASONABLE THAN WHAT THE CURRENT RULES SPECIFY AND BY THE WAY MEMBERS REMEMBER ALL WE'RE DOING HERE IS GIVING THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY CALIFORNIA. THE RIGHT TO WEIGH IN ON WHETHER WE GOT A LOWERED THE THRESHOLD OR NOT SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD BE PUTTING ON THE BALLOT. FOR STATEWIDE VOTE AND THE PEOPLE COULD HAVE THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER THEY WANT WHAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE -- WITH THE CONTROLS TO DROP AT 55% AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN ABOUT. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AT JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AGAIN AND THIS IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WOULD PROVIDE A MORE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO THE WAY SCHOOL SEEK COMMUNITY SUPPORT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS TO THE CHILDREN THAT THEY SERVE. CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE LEAVING MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITHOUT FOR THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE OUR CHILDREN WITH THE QUALITY PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT THEY DESERVE. OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOT RECEIVING ADEQUATE FUNDING FROM BOTH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I SAW THIS MYSELF WHEN I WAS A TRUSTEE TO THE ENGINE THOMAS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SIMILARLY TO CENTER ALLEN WHEN I WAS A TRUSTEE DURING THE TOP DOT COM BUST. WE WERE HAVING TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS -- REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SERVICES THAT WE NEEDED FOR CHILDREN AT THE VERY TIME WE SAW THAT THEY ACTUALLY NEEDED INCREASES IN THE INVESTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY YOU COULD -- GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO MAKE IT TO THEIR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS. AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR THEIR KIDS IF THEY WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO. SCA FIVE WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS OUT THE LOCAL LEVEL. CTA BELIEVE THIS MEASURES GOOD FOR KIDS GOOD FOR SCHOOLS IN GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY ON BEHALF OF THE CTA IRISH OR SUPPORT. IF YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT GOOD MORNING MY MONEY I CANNOT ON BEHALF OF SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE GRAPPLING WITH INCREASING COSTS. AND FOR MANY DISTRICTS THE GROWTH OF THESE COSTS AS FAR OUTPACING THE REVENUES THAT WERE RECEIVING ROM THE STATE. PARCEL TAXES AS ALSO HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID PERSONAL TAXES ARE ONE OF THE FEW WAYS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE AND ABLE TO GENERATE LOCAL REVENUES AND SCA FIVE SIMPLY ALLOWS CALIFORNIA'S VOTERS TO DECIDE. WHETHER OR NOT A 55% THRESHOLD IS APPROPRIATE SO THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN WORK WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO PASS THESE EFFORTS WE ARE TRY VOTE. YOU. GOOD MORNING NANCY TRIED ASSISTING US ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING THE CALIFORNIA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION MANAGERS ALL IN SUPPORT [inaudible] YOU.

CONTRA COSTA SANTA CLARA AND VENTURA COUNTIES ALL IN SUPPORT. EVA JAIL KAPPLE ADVISERS ON BEHALF OF SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT NORWALK Là MARADA UST ALAMEDA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND THE SCHOOL EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT -- SEEING NONE OPPOSITION. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COME MORNING AGAIN DAVID WILL FOR THE HARRY JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TO U. S. C. A FIVE MEMBERS OF ME JUST START BY SAYING EDUCATION FUNDING ON A PER CAPITA BASIS HAS INCREASED BY 30% SINCE PROP THIRTEEN PASSED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SO WE CAN BLAME PROP THIRTEEN FOR A LOT OF THINGS BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN'T BLAME PROP THIRTEEN FORD DECLINES IN EDUCATION FUNDING IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE -- MEMBERS WE KNOW GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE THE POWER TO TAX ITS CITIZENS AND THE TRANSFER OF WEALTH FROM THE PEOPLE WHO BURNED IT WE KNOW THAT AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS POWER SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. AND SHOULD BE USED VERY CAREFULLY. A TWO THIRDS VOTE FOR A WILL TAXES SIMPLY INSURERS DILIGENCE -- WALKER BEFORE TAXES ARE PROPOSED IN VOTED ON MEMBERS TO BE CLEAR. WE DON'T OPPOSE SPECIAL TAXES THAT RECEIVED A TWO THIRDS VOTE WE DON'T OBJECT TO THAT ORANGE COUNTY. HAS PASSED TRANSPORTATION SALES TAXES TWICE WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE -- THERE HAVE BEEN A LARGE MAJORITY OF EDUCATION PERSONAL TAXES APPROVED IN NOVEMBER ELECTION SINCE. TWENTY TWELVE SO CLEARLY TAX THRESHOLDS CAN BE HIT WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE WE'RE FINE WITH THAT. MEMBERS ARE WE TAKE UMBRAGE WITH THE OUR STATEMENTS SUPPORTERS OF MADE THAT SOMEHOW IMMATURITY VOTE IS THE ONLY FAIR EQUITABLE AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO GOVERN. IT'S BEEN STATED -- YOU KNOW THE DISCUSSION ABOUT DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES. DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES HISTORICALLY HAVE REQUIRED A TWO THIRDS VOTE IN MANY MANY CIRCUMSTANCES THERE'S A TWO THIRDS VOTE TO OVERRIDE A GUBERNATORIAL VETO OR TO PASS MOST MOST VOCAL BONDS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL IT TAKES A TWO THIRDS VOTE TO APPROVE A TREATY OR START A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OR CONVICTED IMPEACH OFFICER ALSO REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE. IT TAKES A UNANIMOUS JURY VOTE IN MOST CAPITAL CRIMINAL CASES. SAID THERE'S WIDE PRECEDENT YOU KNOW IN MANY DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT INTERACTIONS -- WHERE A MAJORITY VOTE IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND A HIGHER THRESHOLD IS NEEDED? SO WHY SHOULDN'T THERE BE AYE HIGHER TWO THIRDS VOTE THRESHOLD FOR ONE OF GOVERNMENT'S MOST IMPORTANT POWER. TO TAKE PROPERTY IN THE FORM OF TAXES FROM ITS CITIZENS -- AGAIN. THE ARGUMENTS BEEN MADE HERE AT THAT THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE AS HAS BEEN STATED THEY DO WAY AND THEN A MAJORITY THESE EDUCATION PERSONAL TAXES. LOCAL YOU DO PASSED WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE IN RECENT MEMORY AND THAT TREND IS CONTINUING AND WE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. ALRIGHT MR MAY FILL IN THE GAPS HERE A LITTLE BIT ON SOME OF THE OTHER ARGUMENTS BUT YOU KNOW JUST TO MAKE THE POINT FINALLY THAT PERSONAL TAXES ARE VERY REGRESSIVE. WHY DO YOU OWN A ONE BEDROOM HOUSE OR A MILLION DOLLAR MANSION YOU PAY THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF PERSONAL TAXES --YOU KNOW THEY'RE PUNITIVE THEIR AGGRESSIVE THEIR ADDED ON TO PROPERTY TAX BILL IS ABOVE AND BEYOND PROP THIRTEEN FROM PERCENT CAP -- ADDING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO BILLS YEAR MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE TO AFFORD HOMES SELL FOR ALL THESE REASONS FOR ASK FOR AN OF A THEY GIVE US TWELVE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. TO RESTORE MAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE DESIRE FOR A QUALITY EDUCATION WE HAVE THREE PRIMARY CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL THE FIRST CONCERN IS THIS BILL WOULD FACILITATE TAX INCREASES THAT THEN RESULT IN HIGHER HOUSING COSTS FOR CALIFORNIANS. BOTH IN TERMS OF HOMEOWNERS THAT THEN CAN BE. CALIFORNIA HAS THE TENTH HIGHEST PROPERTY TAX BURDEN IN THE NATION AND THIS BILL BY FACILITATING PARTIAL TAX INCREASES WOULD MAKE THAT PROBLEM EVEN WORSE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO MAKE CALIFORNIA HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE. THIS TAKES US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION MAKING CALIFORNIA LESS AFFORDABLE FOR ALL. OUR SECOND CONCERN IS THAT A CHANGE TO THE VOTE THRESHOLD IS NOT NECESSARY. CURRENTLY BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA BASED ON THE CITY FINANCES AND THE LOADER. SKEWS ME THE LOCAL VOTER BALLOT MEASURE 75% OF ALL LOCAL TAXES HAVE PASSED AND THAT'S GOING HISTORICALLY ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE EARLY. NINETEEN SEVENTIES ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN THE MOST RECENT LOCAL ELECTIONS -- ALSO SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE A SPECIAL CARVE OUT. FOR SPECIAL TAXES LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED. TO PASS VOTE TO PASS WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE BUT CURRENTLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALREADY HAVE A 55% CARVE OUT FOR SCHOOL BONDS THE LAW IN THE VOTE THRESHOLD IS NOT NECESSARY AND ALSO IT PUTS LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES AT A POTENTIAL DISADVANTAGE. LANCE. THE LAST CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE POLL. THAT WAS CONDUCTED IN MARCH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS SUPPORT KEEPING A TWO THIRDS VOTE THRESHOLD. ACROSS ALL DEMOGRAPHICS REPUBLICANS INDEPENDENTS AND DEMOCRATS AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN SUMMER CISCO LA AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY VOTERS UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORT. KEEPING THE TO THE WORD TWO THIRDS VOTE THRESHOLD THANK YOU. KAREN MEMBERS DOMINIC TOMORROW HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TERMS CLOSE ASSOCIATION OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. MORE WISHING THAT WE HAD BEEN SUPPORT IF AMENDED I WOULDN'T SUCH AS SELF CONSCIOUS BEING UP HERE BY MYSELF IN THE BACKGROUND BUT THE AUTHOR STATED THAT THIS IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS IN A MATTER OF DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND WHAT WE WOULD ASK IS. TO MAKE THE BILL MORE FAIR MORE DEMOCRATIC ADD A PROVISION THAT WOULD INCLUDE CHARTER SCHOOLS -- CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN LEFT OUT IN LOCAL PARCEL TAX -- MEASURES AND SINCE THEY ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE PARENTS OF CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE TAX PAYING INDIVIDUALS AND HOMEOWNERS AROUND. THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE SCHOOLS EXIST IT SEEMS LIKE A MATTER OF FAIRNESS IT WOULD BE THE INCLUDE CHARTER SCHOOLS AS RECIPIENTS OF THESE DOLLARS. IN THE MEASURE IN THERE FOR THAT IS THE AMENDMENT THAT WE WOULD ASK FOR SO AGAIN WE ARE OPPOSED TO LISTEN MANDATE AND WE ARE. VERY SIMPLE REQUEST IS ENDING INCLUDING CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. SERRA BUT WITH CAL CHAMBER IN A POSITION AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION -- ME BACK TO COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS [inaudible] THIS SISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER HERE ON ALLEN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- IT WORST WE'RE STILL STARVING OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM SO THAT'S THAT'S THE BASIC PREMISE. AND CAPITALS NOT GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT ALL HAVE TO FOR THE OPERATION SO I'M THERE WITH YOU. EXCITED TO SUPPORT WHEN ASKED ABOUT MECHANICS WISE THE THE CHARTERS -- IF IF A LOCAL. OKAY EVAN DISTRICT WANTS TO ASSESS ITSELF FOR THAT COMMUNING WITH PROCESS ITSELF IT WOULDN'T GO INTO THE GENERAL FUND THEN AND THEN. BE ELIGIBLE THE OTHER. ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL AUTHORIZED IN THAT AREA I I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT. SO RIGHT NOW -- SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE E. RIGHT NOW IN LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE -- THE DISTRICT HAS A STRUCTURED THAT PARTIAL TAX PROPOSAL AND IN A WAY THAT WILL. GIVE OUT WHATEVER MONEY IS GENERATED -- BOUGHT A PER PUPIL BASIS AND IN A CERTAIN PORTION OF IT WILL GO TO THE CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE DISTRICT. ON THE WAY THAT THAT THAT THAT pBOARD MADE AND THEY OBVIOUSLY NEGOTIATED THAT WITH THE CHARTER FOLKS AS A WAY OF TRYING TO GET EVERYONE ON BOARD TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE. I'M THAT THAT'S NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW. AND I KNOW THAT CENTER HELL AND ENTER FOLKS ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS -- BUT BUT RIGHT NOW THE LAW SAYS THAT IT'S UP TO THE SCHOOL BOARD TO MAKE THAT. JUDGMENT CALL AS TO HOW IT STRUCTURES THE THE THE THE EXPENDITURES AFTERWARDS AND THAT -- IT'S AT THE DISCRETION OF THE LOCAL DISTRICT YEAH OF COURSE. OFTENTIMES THE VERY OFTEN THE DISTRICT FINDS IT. YOU KNOW IF IN THEIR INTERESTS TO STRIKE THAT SIR TO DEAL WITH THE CHARTER FOLKS SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A STRONG COALITION OF SUPPORT. THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN WITH MEASURE E. IN LOS ANGELES BUT RIGHT NOW UNDER THE LAW IT'S IT'S A DECISION THAT IS NOT PART IS JUST LOW. EXACTLY UNDERSTOOD OKAY THANK YOU. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT DEFINITELY CODES SENATOR AS ADD WHATEVER THEY THEY CHOOSE WHATEVER THEY FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH THE COMMUNITY AND CHARTERS COULD BE PART OF THAT. SO DO. I I SUPPOSE THIS IS GILDING THE LILY SO IS PERMISSIVE BUT NOT REQUIRED. UNDER CURRENT LAW UNDER OKAY UNDER THIS BILL IN THE BILL IT'S PERMISSIVE FOR CHARTERS TO BE LIKE COLLUDED IT'S UP TO THE DISTRICT. TO HIGHLIGHT THAT TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE MEASURE THAT THEY'RE PUTTING BEFORE THE VOTERS -- OTHER QUESTIONS. I HAVE A OF A QUESTION -- MISTO MAY IF IF IF YOU WILL YOU IT WOULD SAID THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD PUT CITIES AND COUNTIES AT A DISADVANTAGE I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW THAT. HOW THAT WORKS? THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UNDER CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CITY OR COUNTY. LOCAL DISTRICT OUTSIDE OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO PASS A SPECIAL TAX THE VOTE THRESHOLD IS TWO THIRDS. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT TO PASS THIS TYPE OF TAX. LOWERING THAT 255% MEANS THAT WHEN IT'S ON THE SAME BALLOT. SHOULD A TAXPAYER PICK AGAINST ATTACKS THAT IS A TWO THIRDS VOTE OR 55% VOTE A LOT OF TIMES THERE'S WHAT'S CALLED TAX OF TAX TOLERANCE VOTER TOLERANCE. AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT THERE COULD BE TAXES FOR TRANSPORTATION THAT IS A SPECIAL DESIGNATED TAX REQUIRING TWO THIRDS VOTE VERSUS A SPECIAL DESIGNATED TAX FOR SCHOOLS ONE IS THAT. TWO THIRDS AND ONE IS A ALL RIGHT I SEE CENTER AL LOOKS LIKE HE WAS UP ON RIGHT AND WITH WITH SO MUCH RESPECT I I I I I WOULD. ANY CITY MANAGER WORTH HIS SALT BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE AT EXIT EIGHTEEN YEAH BECAUSE THE CURRENT STRUCTURE. I THEY WOULDN'T GO FOR SPECIAL TAX TO GO FOR A GENERAL SALES AND USE TAXES ONLY REQUIRES A A ONE VOTE -- SO IN THIS CASE STILL THE SCHOOLS WOULD BE DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE LEASE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT A 55% THRESHOLD AS OPPOSED TO MAJORITY -- THRESHOLD SO I I AGREE WITH YOU WITH REGARDS TO AND HOW THE SUBJECT OPPOSED TO IT TO A SPECIAL TAX BUT BUT BUT THE THE SALES AND USE TAX FOR GENERAL FUND PURPOSES IS SUCH A OF AN EASIER THRESHOLD THAT MANY CITIES ARE NOW AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THAT OPTION. AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE FAIR COMPARISON AND IN THAT COMPARISON THE SCHOOLS WOULD STILL BE DISADVANTAGED UNDER THIS. I SCA WAS C. MISTEL MAY OF THE OF GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD OUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THERE IS QUITE A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GENERAL TAXES AND SPECIAL TAXES AS WE KNOW A LOT OF TIMES JUST. EIGHT GENERAL TAX ALTHOUGH IT IS A 50% MAJORITY VOTE -- BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GO TO A SPECIFIC PURPOSE VOTERS ARE LESS LIKELY IF THEY DON'T SEE THE RESULT IN A NEW ROAD. AND YOU KNOW -- NEW STREET LIGHTS OR WHATEVER. IF THE PURPOSE IS NOTSPECIFIED THERE'S LESS CHANCE FOR THE VOTER TO BE INCLINED TO VOTE FOR THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE OTHER COMPETING TAXES ON THE BALLOT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT OFSENATORS WOULD LIKE CLOSE DOING DO IT TOGETHER YOU INTO YOUR CLOSE TOGETHER. WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT TO GET ON WE DO A DANCE ROUTINE BY ABOUT ARM THE I MEAN I JUST THINK THAT THAT THE THE FACTS ARE CLEAR THAT THIS IS ABOUT FAIRNESS IT IS ABOUT EQUITY AND YOU KNOW MISTER WOLF MENTIONED THAT TO TWO TWO THIRDS VOTE ASSURES. DILIGENT FORWARD IT REALLY DOES IS IT IS IT IS SURE IS THAT THE MINORITY. pTHE MAJORITY THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR COUNTRY'S ABOUT THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT THE MINORITY SOULD NOT BE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. AND THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF OF OF OF OUR TAX SYSTEM IS CERTAINLY A AN APPROPRIATE USE OF THE ELECTIONS AND AND THE NEEDIS SO GREAT TODAY. IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING BACK THE FAIRNESS IT'S NECESSARY SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE WITH THE THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR THANK YOU SIR HELLO SIR ALLAN WHAT HE SAID. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU -- I BELIEVE THERE WAS A MOTION THAT WAS IT SENATOR STERN MOVES -- ALL RIGHT MA'AM SIR TO BE CULTURAL. MOTION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS NUMBER. NUMBER GUY NIELSEN. NIELSEN NO HERTZBERG. LEYVA. LEYVA AYE STERN STERN I ALL RIGHT -- WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN SEVEN HERTZBERG WAS HERE A MOMENT AGO SELF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES [inaudible] SENATOR ALLEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS A TWO THIS IS SCA TO RELATING -- TO RECALLS I I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THE HARD WORK ON THE BILL [inaudible] AND AT THIS THIS BILL. BASICALLY IS MODELED AFTER A SYSTEM. THAT WE SEE IN ARIZONA NEVADA NORTH DAKOTA AND WISCONSIN. AND IT IT SIMPLIFIES OUR CURRENT RECALL PROCESS FOR STATE OFFICIALS AND ENSURES THAT THE CANDIDATE WHO ACTUALLY HAS THE MOST VOTES ON ELECTION DAY. THE RECALL ELECTION DAY WINS THE SEAT. SO CALIFORNIA'S ONE NINETEEN STATES THAT PERMIT THE RECALL STATE OFFICIALS. MAJORITY STATES DON'T INTERESTINGLY -- THEY THAT THOSE STATES RELY ENTIRELY UPON IMPEACHMENT. HAS -- FORM OF REMOVAL FROM OFFICE -- THE FRAMERS -- THOUGH HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE FRAMERS THE RECALL. YOU KNOW THEY WANTED THERE TO BE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR VOTERS TO WEIGH IN BUT BUT IT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL INTENT. AND AND THE DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATES OVER THE FRAMING OF OUR RECALL RULES. I THAT THE FRAMERS DID WANTED TO BE A TOOL THAT WAS WAS ONLY USE UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. AND AND IT TIGHTLY TALKED ABOUT MALFEASANCE IN A AND CORRUPTION AND AND AND THAT SORT OF THING. NOW. I THINK THERE BEEN SOME CONCERNS RAISED RECALLS HAVE BEEN USED BOTH AGAINST. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS -- SOMETIMES AROUND ONE VOTE -- THAT CAN LEAD TO ABUSES BY WELL FINANCE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS -- ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS THOUGH -- IS A IS ABOUT THE MECHANICS. AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THIS VOTER CONFUSION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TWO PART QUESTION ANYBODY WHO WAS INVOLVED WITH THE JEFF DENHAM OR THE JOSH NEWMAN. I RECALL CAMPAIGN OR THE OR THE GRAY DAVIS RECALL CAMPAIGNS REMEMBER THAT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN A LOT OF VOTERS DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE VOTING TWICE. I IN FACT IN THE RECENT RECALL DOWN. IN ORANGE COUNTY -- THERE WAS A A 30% DIFFERENCE A 30% DROP IN THOSE WHO VOTED ON QUESTION ONE VERSUS QUESTION TOO SO 30% LESS. OF THE VOTERS -- VOTED ON QUESTION TWO VERSES QUESTION. ONE NOW I AND AND THIS LEADS TO A CRAZY SYSTEM THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM MEMBERS. IT IS IT IS [inaudible] A FREQUENT. THAT I A MEMBER THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT SOMEBODY ENDS UP -- WITH MORE VOTES. TO KEEP THE INCUMBENT IN OFFICE. THEN THE PERSON WHO. IS A REPLACEMENT CANDIDATE SO SO THE THE MORE PEOPLE WHO VOTED NO ON THE RECALL. THEN THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY END UP REPLACING THE SITTING INCUMBENT. AFTER THE ELECTION. YOU KNOW I'D GET. YOU IF THEM PROBABLY ALL OF US WOULD BE TURFED OUT OF OFFICE IF IF IT WAS IF WE WERE RUNNING AGAINST KIND OF A HYPOTHETICAL PERFECT CANDIDATE BUT THE FACT IS MEMBERS YOU ALL KNOW THAT WE ALL HAVE TO RUN FOR OFFICE AGAINST REAL PEOPLE. AND VOTERS AFTER ACTION MAKE A REAL CHOICE BETWEEN REAL PEOPLE AND PERFECT AS WE ALL ARE. AND THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW A PRESIDENTIAL DISAPPROVAL APPROVAL RATING IS IS IS A FEMORAL AND AND NOT THAT INSTRUCTED YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT HOW DOES THAT PRESIDENT HOW DOES THAT GOVERNOR HOW DOES THAT LEGISLATOR ACTUALLY PAIR UP AGAINST. A POTENTIAL RIVAL A POTENTIAL -- AN ACTUAL POTENTIAL A CANDIDATE. AND O THAT'S THE CRAZINESS OF OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS THAT WE NOW ALLOW WE NOW HAVE A SYSTEM WHEREBY. WE REPLACE AN INCUMBENT WITH SOMEBODY WHO OFTENTIMES HAS FAR FEWER VOTES. ON THE VERY SAME RECALL ELECTION DAY THAN THE INCUMBENT. WHO IS BEING TURFED OUT? SO WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO HERE WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS SHORTCOMING THIS CONFUSION IN CALIFORNIA'S RECALL PROCESS AND WE'RE GONNA WE WE SEEK TO FOLLOW US A SIMPLER RECALL MODEL THAT'S BEEN ADOPTED IN. EASIER FOR STATES BY THE WAY THAT ARE NOT YOU KNOW. BEAR TRICK PURPLE YEAR OR EVEN READ WRITE ARIZONA NEVADA NORTH DAKOTA AND WISCONSIN. THE IDEA IS THAT WE WOULD ELIMINATE THE CONFUSING YES NO RECALL QUESTION INSTEAD IF A RECALL IS TRIGGERED BY A SIGNATURE COLLECTION CAMPAIGN. WE WOULD THEN WE WOULD THEN PLACE THAT THAT WOULD TRIGGER A RECALL AUTOMATICALLY. IN ALL OF THE CANDIDATES BOTH THE INCUMBENT AND ANY POTENTIAL CHALLENGER WOULD THEN BE ON THE BALLOT. I AND WHOEVER GETS THE MOST VOTES WOULD WIN THE ELECTED OFFICE. BY THE WAY MEMBERS ON RECALL ELECTION DAY TWO THOUSAND AND THREE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER ACTUALLY GOT MORE VOTES THAN GRAY DAVIS -- SO SO MORE PEOPLE VOTED TO MAKE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER GOVERNOR THEN VOTED. AGAINST THE RECALL OF GRAY DAVIS ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER UNDER THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED UNDER UNDER THE THE THE ADDRESS YOU TO BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE. THAT IF WE ACTUALLY ARE GOING. TO TO KICK SOMEBODY OUT. THERE OUGHT TO BE REPLACED BY SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY ENJOYS MORE POPULAR SUPPORT. THEN THE INCUMBENT HE'S BEING TURFED OUT. THAT'S A SIMPLE CONCEPT ARE IT'S A CONCEPT THAT HAS BEEN -- IT THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR MANY YEARS SUCCESSFULLY IN UP IN A AND A SLEW OF OTHER STATES AND WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OF THOSE SUPPORT OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS BY THE COMMITTEE. NO ALL RIGHT IT'S MOVE BY CENTER LEYVA -- NO QUESTIONS SURROUND WAS LIKE CLOSE. YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS THIS IS THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT ENSURING THAT. THE THAT THAT IF SOMEONE'S GOING TO BE KICKED OUT OF OFFICE THEY ARE THAT -- THEY OUGHT TO BE REPLACED BY SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY ENJOYS MORE POPULAR SUPPORT THAN THEY DO. ON THAT ALEXIAN DAY -- THIS WILL MAKE OUR SYSTEM BETTER IT'S MODELED AFTER WORKABLE SYSTEM% AND FOR OTHER STATES AND AND I I REALLY DO HOPE THAT YOU'LL FIND YOUR WAY TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY.
