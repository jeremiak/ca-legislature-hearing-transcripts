THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR IN AND LET ME JUST START BY AGAIN- RECOGNIZING THE TRAGEDIES THAT HAVE OCCURRED- AND CERTAINLY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS WE ARE. LOOKING AT ANY GIVEN TRAGEDY SUCH AS THOSE THAT YOU JUST- IDENTIFIED OUR RESPONSE IS TO GO OUT AND UNDERSTAND IN WHAT HE SAID HAND IN HAND WITH THE COUNTY TO UNDERSTAND THE STEPS. THAT WERE TAKEN OR POTENTIALLY- NOT TAKEN- IN IN IN SOME OF THESE CASES- ALONG THE WAY AND SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE- WE AS PART OF OUR OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT WE ARE MONITORING COMPLIANCE- AROUND TIMELINESS AROUND. A USING THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING TOOL FOR COUNTIES- WE ARE RECEIVING QUARTERLY REPORTS AND HAVE QUARTER QUARTERLY A CONTACT WITH COUNTIES AROUND THESE PARTICULAR GIVEN DATA POINTS THAT WERE SAYING THAT AREN'T MATCHING THAT WE'VE QUESTIONS RELATED TO. HOW WE ALSO ARE OF COURSE ARE MONITORING TO SYSTEM TREATMENT PLAN OF PART OF OUR APPS THE OUR- FAMILY SERVICE REVIEW PROCESS SO THERE'S NO HUESO WERE CAUGHT. COMMUNICATE IN ASSESSING WHAT'S WHAT'S OCCURRING IN COMMUNICATION WORK WERE THERE THERE HAVE BEEN THESE FATALITIES IT HAS BEEN OUR PRACTICE TO ACTUALLY DEPLOY TO THE COMMUNITY.

I DIDN'T FIVE WHICH THOSE WE ALSO WERE TO AND- IN THAT PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT PLAN SO THAT WE HAVE AN ABILITY TO MONITOR OPEN THE WAY AS WELL. I WILL TELL YOU. THAT SOME OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT THAT WE FOR. IN LAW ANGELES WHICH REALLY ALL ABOUT. AT A PRACTICE.

IMPROVED OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY HAVE DATA COLLECTED SO WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN OVER SIX THOUSAND. YOUTH A TRAFFIC AT THAT WE ARE CAPTURING WE THINK THAT POTENTIALLY COULD EVEN BE AN UNDERCOUNT BASED ON- THAT THE NEWNESS OF OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT- WE HAVE REALLY BEEN LOOKING AT BOTH THE TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACHES KIND OF MULTI DISCIPLINARY ACROSS ANY SYSTEMS THAT HAVE. ACT WITH THIS DELAY SPENDING YOUTH. WE ALSO BELIEVE WRITING BUT TECH ASSIST THE HARMONS MODEL REALLY KNOWLEDGE THAT A MIGHT NOT BE.

A SUBCOMMITTEE FOCUSED ON THIS EFFORT WHO IS- ALSO SHARING IN DEVELOPING SOME RESOURCES THAT CAN BE USED ON THOSE MULTI MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS- WE I THINK HAVE A SCRATCH THE SURFACE AND WE HAVE MUCH MORE TO LEARN ABOUT THE APPROACHES THAT AT WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY BUT I THINK AGAIN- IN OUR IN OUR FIRST- ATTEMPTS AND LOOK AT. WHAT WE KNOW IS WORKING IT IS THAT THIS HARM REDUCTION MODEL IS SUCCESSFUL IN THAT WE'RE NOT CLOSING THE DOOR TO THE YOUTH. WHO WE ACKNOWLEDGE MAY IT MAY I MAY GO BACK TO THE TRAFFICKER IN SOME CASES AND IN RETURN SO. AGAIN IT'S A PLACE THAT I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT'S A PRIORITY OF THAT SECRETARY AS WELL- AND MUCH MORE TO EXPLORE. WONDERFUL WELL THANK YOU.

YES WE WOULD WE WOULD WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS IN MEDICAL TO LOOK AT WHETHER WAS APPROPRIATE- PURSUE QUARANTINE OR IN ISOLATION SETTING.

THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR SERVICE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR MINING.

AT THE TOP WITH PEOPLE SAY AND THIS IS APPROPRIATING GOOD AND PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I WANTED TO ASK- IN LIGHT OF A AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THEIR BEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT- BRINGING OUT OF STATE INMATES BACK INTO CALIFORNIA- OBVIOUSLY FOR MANY REASONS THAT'S GOOD. AND WE STILL HAVE I THINK. MAYBE A THOUSAND ARE YOU'LL KNOW THE NUMBERS IN PRIVATE AT CONTRACTED PRISONS IN LIGHT OF THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL TO. CLOSE A PRISON TELL ME HOW YOU SEE THAT ARE THE I HATE WHEN WILL WE ANTICIPATE NOT. USING OUR PRIVATE CONTRACTED PRISON OR WILL WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT EVEN AS WE LOOK TOWARDS POTENTIALLY A GOAL OF CLOSING A PRISON DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ON THAT I DO- IN THE CURRENT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE EXPECT TO BE OUT OF ALL MALE PRIVATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES BY THE END OF APRIL. OF THIS YEAR- WHICH WILL LEAVE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED CONTRACT- FEMALE BED STILL IN PLACE- WE ARE LOOKING AT A PROBABLY A TIME FRAME OF EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS TO BRING DOWN WAS FEMALE THAT ONCE WE BRING. ME OVER RATE WHICH IT LOOKS WE WILL AND WE'RE- CAN BRING IN ADDITIONAL. BEDS UP THE FEMALE PARTY THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO CLOSE THOSE FACILITIES IN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME PERIOD- THEN AFTER WE COMPLETE THE CLOSURE OF THE PRIVATE HEALTH FACILITIES WE ALSO ARE LOOKING AT THE PUBLIC COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. AND ARE PROPOSING A TAKE DOWN PLAN OF THOSE FACILITIES OVER THE NEXT TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. VERY THANK YOU. I'M IDEA I HAVE TO SAY- FROM THIS COMMITTEE- THE SECRETARY'S BEEN INCREDIBLY RESPONSIVE ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES MORE THANK THE GOVERNOR STAFF. BECAUSE WE'VE HAD ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT HAVE YOU KNOW. IN PART OF CDC OURS HISTORY YOU TALKED ABOUT A SEA CHANGE WHEN YOU MADE YOUR- YOUR OPENING COMMENTS AND IN A NUMBER OF WAYS WHETHER IT'S- SUPPORT UP HERE SUPPORT- BUT ANY NUMBER OF ISSUES. BUT I DO HAVE TO ASK YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. A AND GET YOUR REACTION TO REASSIGNING INVESTIGATIONS OF STAFF COMPLAINTS THAT COULD RESULT IN DISCIPLINARY ACTION- SO THAT IS NOT BE IN A SUMMER NOT BEING HANDLED AT THE FACILITY BUT OF A BROADER APPROACH. CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME COMMENTS ON THAT I THINK. IT YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW WE GET REPORTS OF FREQUENTLY ABOUT AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS AND I THINK SOMETIMES THOSE ARE DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET THE PERSPECTIVE FROM HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS ON THE GROUND SO I WANT TO. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BUT IN TERMS OF HOW THESE- COMPLAINTS ARE HANDLED INVESTIGATIONS ARE DONE. SOME THOUGHT PROCESSES ABOUT HOW THIS WILL BE. A PROCESS THAT REALLY PUTS IT IN THE HANDS OF SOMEONE WHO CAN MAKE THE DETERMINATION AND IT ISN'T THE STAFF INVESTIGATING INCIDENTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE EVEN. HAD MORE KNOWLEDGE OF OUR BEEN PART OF OUR YOU KNOW WHAT I'M REFERRING TO SO MAYBE YOU CAN. BE A SO WE RECEIVED APPROVAL APPROVAL AND THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET TO- ESTABLISH OUR ALLEGATION INQUIRY MANAGEMENT SECTION WHICH- BASICALLY- ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT. TO WHEN IT WHEN IT MAY FOLLOWS A STAFF COMPLAINT THAT MEETS THE CRITERIA IS A STAFF COMPLAINT- TO PULL THE REVIEW OF THAT COMPLAIN THAT IS NOW DONE WITHIN THE PRISON BY PRISON STAFF THAT WILL BE DONE- BY AN EXTERNAL GROUP- THE REPORTS UP TO OUR OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. SO WE HAVE HIRED A NUMBER OF LIEUTENANTS THAT WILL BE GOING OUT AND THEY WILL BE DOING THE REVIEW IN THE INQUIRY OF THOSE COMPLAINTS- BUT I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECES OF WILL BE DONE BY SOMEONE THAT- AT THE PRISON OR STORE THE INDIVIDUAL SIDE WILL NOT BE ONE THAT HAS WORKED AT THAT PERSON. AND WE HAVEN'T OF INDEPENDENCE THEY WILL PARROTING COREY REPORT- THAT WILL TEN GO BACK TO THE CAPTAIN THAT OVERSEES THAT LIEUTENANT- FOR FORTY NOW REPORT ON TO HARD IT'S ALREADY DETERMINE WHERE THAT. IT'S A FULL SCALE OFFICE INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION WHEN THE CORRECTIVE ACTION IS REQUIRED OR IF THE COMPLAIN APPEARS TO BE UNFOUNDED.AND SO WE'RE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO ROLL THIS OUT WE EXPECT THE REGULATIONS TRICKLE IN EFFECT APRIL FIRST. WHICH IS ALSO THE SAME TIME WILL BE ROLLING. OUT OR ELECTRONIC TRACK THROUGH OUR- VENDOR MAY. SYSTEM OF THE SAME WHICH ALLOWS GENERATE VARIOUS REPORTS- DEFY TRENDS AND REALLY GET A PULL SO WHAT'S GOING ON INSTITUTIONS. THANK YOU. I CAN I A- ASK IF. IN AN APPROPRIATE PERIOD OF TIME DOWN THE ROAD YOU KNOW. SIX MONTHS OUR THEREAFTER AND I HAVE LOOK AT STAFF TO TRACK- WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO GIVE US OUR AS A RESPONSE AND REACTION TO HOW YOU THINK THAT IS WORKING- SALUTE WE ARE I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT- AND SO WILL PROBABLY FOLLOW UP IN AND- SEND YOU A LETTER AND LET YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS- FIRST THANK YOU YOUR STAFF FOR TAKING TIME TO GET TO KNOW ME. IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE. I'D LIKE TO FIRST INTRODUCE- OUR NEW. SECRETARY OF THE GOVERNOR UPPER OPERATIONS ORGANIZATION JANA RICHARDSON'S WHO WHO WITH THEIR TEAM IS HERE TO SUPPORT ME TODAY AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THAT TEAM- I'D LIKE TO THINK THE GOVERNOR FOR- THE SUPPORT IN AND POINT ME IN THIS POSITION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I'D LIKE pCUTLER. WHO'S BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO STANDING UP TODAY DINNER IS FOR SOME. WELCOME WITHOUT JENNIFER SUPPORT I COULDN'T DO THIS TYPE OF JOB AND- AND SHE'S BEEN MY PARTNER FOR YEARS AND I CAN'T SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE HER- POSSIBLE INCREDIBLY GOOD INTRODUCTION. WERE OR WERE NOTING THAT SHOULD I STOP. DOBBS ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS A SMALL ORGANIZATION WITH A REALLY LARGE MISSION AND- WHEN I WAS A CLIENT THAT AGENCY AND- OVERSEEN REGULATIONS FOR THE PARMA CORRECTIONS WORKING WITH THOSE ATTORNEYS I'D ENVISIONED THIS LARGE CADRE OF STAFF AND ATTORNEYS THERE BECAUSE OF THE DETAIL. THAT THEY GAVE TO THEIR ANALYSIS AND THEIR EXPLANATIONS AND THEIR HELP- WAS SO HUGE I JUST EXPECTED TO BE A LOT MORE OF THEM SO I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED WHEN I GOT OVER THERE TO SEE HOW SMALL THE ORG CHART WAS- WHILE THEY STILL CONTINUE TO MEET THEIR MISSION. AND SO MY GOALS FOR THE LOS MINISTER OF LAW FOR ONE IS JUST CONTINUE THAT EXCELLENCE- TO ENSURE THAT MY ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO REVIEW IN A TIMELY FASHION- BOTH- THIS MISSION OF REGULATIONS AND EMERGENCY REGULATIONS- AS WELL AS- OVERSIGHT AND DETERMINATIONS ON UNDERGROUND REGULATION PETITIONS. AND I THINK OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND OUR TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES. FOR MOST STATE EMPLOYEES MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND- LEGISLATIVE STAFF. AND THE WORKING ON THAT I CONTINUOUSLY SINCE I'VE BEEN THERE I THINK EDUCATION. ON REGULATIONS AND HOW TO. APPROPRIATELY PROMULGATE THEM- IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND SO I PLEDGETO YOU THEY'LL CONTINUE TO WORK AS LONG AS I'M IN THIS POSITION- TO BOTH CONTINUE THE EXCELLENCE BUT AS WELL AS IT BRING THAT INFORMATION OUT TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND THE STAFF. THE WORK ON THIS TYPE OF A REGULATORY A LOT AND SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE. THANK YOU. YOUR START SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MISTER POPE THANK YOU WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION- YESTERDAY AND- WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND THANK YOU YOUR WIFE IN COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR SUPPORT MAYBE JUST TO EXTENDING A LITTLE THE FOUNDATION YOU JUST LAID- I THINK MANY OF US AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH. BOTH WHAT YOU'RE TASKED WITH IN YOUR DEPARTMENT IN THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE TO DO THAT AND SO I THINK IN OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY- I CAN ASK YOU IF YOU HAD A MAGIC WAND. QUOTE WOULD BE THE- LET'S JUST SAY THE MORE IDEAL- STAFFING A RESOURCES YOU RECEIVE- YOU WORK WITH AGENCIES. IN REVIEWING PROPOSED RATINGS YOU PROVIDE THE LEGAL ANALYSIS AND FEEDBACK SOMETIMES THOSE ARE TESTED IN THE COURTS YOUR TEAM IS LAWYERS AND SUPPORT STAFF- MAYBE GIVE US A LITTLE BETTER VISION OF KIND OF THE TREADMILL THAT YOU'RE ON IN IN THE CHALLENGES WHEN. A STAFF PERSON OR A COUPLE STAFF PEOPLE HAVE TO GET ASSIGNED TO A PARTICULAR. CRISIS OR IMMEDIATE NEED AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THE FLOW OF THE BROADER MISSION OF THE OFFICE CERTAINLY. SO WE GENERALLY GET TWO TYPES OF REGULATIONS HELLO THERE SOME EXCEPTIONS BUT WE HAVE THE NORMAL REGULATORY PROCESS WHERE WHEN WE RECEIVE A REGULATION AND WE HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO CONDUCT A REVIEW. ATTRACT MANY CHANGES TO WORK WITH THE ORGANIZATION SUBMITTING THOSE REGULATIONS AND TO HOPEFULLY APPROVE THEM AT THE END OF THE DAY- IN SOME INSTANCES WERE LEFT WITH THE ONLY OPTION BEING DISAPPROVAL- BUT EVEN THEN MY ATTORNEYS WORK WITH FAT ORGANIZATION. TO ENSURE THAT THE CHANGES ARE MADE THE PROPER NOTICE IS GIVEN TO THE PUBLIC- AND THEN HOPEFULLY THEIR RESUBMITTED TO US WHERE WE CAN APPROVE THAT- THE OTHER COMMON TYPE OF REGULATION IS AN EMERGENCY REGULATION OR WE ONLY HAVE TEN DAYS INCLUDING WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS. IN WHICH TO CONDUCT A REVIEW AND SO A LOT OF THOSE OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE TO THE STATE AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND SO WE HAVE TO GO ALL HANDS ON DECK AT THAT TIME TO REVIEW THOSE AND GET THEM DONE THAT TEN DAY PERIOD- I CURRENTLY HAVE ELEVEN REVIEWING ATTORNEYS- THAT HANDLE THOSE I RECEIVE- OVER EIGHT HUNDRED. REGULATION PACKAGES PER YEAR SELECT DIVIDING THAT UP AMONGST THOSE ELEVEN. AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THOSE ATTORNEYS IS ASSIGNED TO MY UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS UNIT- WHERE THEY ARE DEALING WITH PETITIONS- FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND INTERESTED PARTIES- CHALLENGING- ALLEGED UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN PROMULGATED THROUGH THE APA PROCESS. SO WHAT I'M REALLY LEFT WITH THIS TEN ATTORNEYS TO SPLIT UP THOSE A HUNDRED OR SO- REGULATION FILES- AND SO. I WISH I HAD A MAGIC WAND AND I WOULD CERTAINLY BE WAVING AT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE A DIFFICULTY WITH HIS IN ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IS WE DON'T FAIL. IN MEETING THOSE REGULATORY TIME FRAMES. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE GET A LOT OF REGULATIONS IN ITS LAST TIME PER REGULATION THAT WE CAN SPEND- ON EACH OF THOSE REGULATIONS AND SO. IT'S DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF ARGUMENT THAT WE'RE FEELING THEIR MISSION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT WHAT I THINK. EVERYONE ELSE TO RECOGNIZE AND I'LL DO MY BEST ADVOCATE FOR IS THAT. WE COULD CERTAINLY DO MORE IN THAT TIME FRAME IF WE HAD RESOURCES TO DO IT- NE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I'VE IMPLEMENTED THAT. IS SO FAR HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR BUT I DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT VERY OFTEN IS EARLY INTERVENTION WHERE ONE OF MY SENIOR ATTORNEYS AS A SIGN TO A FILE. IN ADVANCE OF THE FILING COMING TO AL- WHERE THEY'RE GIVING GUIDANCE ON ENSURING THAT DUE PROCESS IS AVAILABLE TO INTERESTED PARTIES. AND THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EIGHT PM MATT MATT STREAMLINES A PART OF THAT PROCESS AND RESULTS IN A BETTER REGULATION. IF I HAD MY MAGIC WAND I THINK I'D WAIVE IT TO HAVE A SMALL TEAM OF EXPERIENCE ATTORNEYS WHO COULD DO MORE OF THAT TYPE OF WORK. BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WITH THE BUDGET. BEING WHAT IT IS AND- WITH THE CONCERNS THAT WE DISCUSSED WITH THE CORONA VIRUSES AFFECTING THE ECONOMY I KNOW THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO ASK FOR- BUT I WILL BE MONITORING THE HANDS AND HOPEFULLY COMING FORWARD WITH RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE FUTURE. WELL THANK UNITS ONE OF MY TAKEAWAYS FROM OUR CONVERSATION WAS. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES IN MAY RELATIVELY LIMITED RESOURCES- YOU SHARED WITH SOME ENTHUSIASM THE ESPRIT DE CORPS OF THE TEAM THE WORK WITH HIM. THAT THAT'S KIND OF MY FINAL QUESTION I THINK WOULD BE GOOD TO SHARE SOME OF THAT I WAS. IMPRESSED WITH THE ENTHUSIASM THAT YOU HAVE FOR YOUR TEAM IN THE WORK THAT YOU DO. I THANK YOU I HAVE AN AMAZING TEAM OF ATTORNEYS WITH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND- COSTLY WALKING DOWN THE HALL WITH THESE EMERGENCY AISLES AND I. GET VOLUNTEERS FOR WORK. I NEVER HAVE. I GET A FADE WHEN I HAVE OFF THESE REALLY MESSY FIVE. OR RESULT IN A LOT OF WORK AND IF I COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER TEAM AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT WORKING THERE IS HOW POSITIVE. EVERYONE IN THAT UNIT IS AND IT'S REALLY PART OF A SMALL ORGANIZATION LIKE THAT WITH THAT. BUT I CONTINUE THAT POSITIVENESS AND ALL SUPPORT COMMITTEE WHERE I CAN. THANK YOU IN WE JUST ASK THAT YOU EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO ALL OF YOUR TEAM IN. APPRECIATE YOUR STEPPING UP. TO THIS NEW CHALLENGE THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NOMINATION AND ARE YOU HAVE A FAN ON ALL THAT HAPPENS TO BE SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO ME KIND OF- I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET DIRECTLY WITH YOU THAT TIME I BELIEVE HE'S KNOWN YOU QUITE AWHILE AND GAVE YOU A FIVE STAR SO. I'M GOOD WITH THAT BUT I'M GLAD THAT YOU DID A DRESSY UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS THAT IS AN ISSUE I IN TERMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BY NOT GOING TO THE REGULAR PROCESS AND THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON THAT IN YOU WILL HAVE CERTAINLY MY ATTENTION TO RESOURCES BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING- I WON'T COME COMPLAINTS BUT CONCERNS FROM PROVIDERS IN ISSUES ON THAT IN THAT VERY ROUND SO- WILL GIVE YOU A YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MORE OF THAT WITH US AS YOU GO FORWARD. AND YOU WILL HAVE MY- MY OWN HIGH FIVE- FOUR YEAR CONFIRMATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOK COMES UP THANKS A LOT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A- HAVE A GREAT STAFF TO BY THE WAY AT THE RULES COMMITTEE AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE. STAFF AND MEMBERS IN SUPPORT WE LIKE TO GIVE- CHRIS A HARD TOP- BUT HE'S NOT EASY BY THE WAY. WE JUST ASSURE YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM WORLD CHRIS BURNS ENDORSEMENTS IS GOOD ENOUGH. I'M GOING TO FOREGO ANY QUESTIONS AND PLAN TO SUPPORT YOUR NOMINATION CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU. SENATOR ROTH THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM OF MORE CONGRATULATIONS AND I NTEND TO OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT THE NOMINATION I'M JUST CURIOUS HOWEVER WHEN THE- OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW DETERMINES THAT A STATE AGENCY. SIR WORKS UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR ISSUE SOMETHING THAT YOU DETERMINED TO BE AN UNDERGROUND REGULATION IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS IMPROPERLY PROMULGATED AND SHE WAS IN THE AGENCY FAILED TO FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT. WHY SHOULD. SOMEONE THIRD PARTY HAVE TO GO TO THE SUPERIOR COURT. IN ORDER TO GET A DETERMINATION THAT SETS ASIDE THAT REGULATION. VERY FOR QUESTION WHY SHOULDN'T WHY SHOULDN'T THE ADMINISTRATION ON IT. AND DIRECT AN AGENCY TO CORRECT SOMETHING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY IMPROPER THAT YOU IN YOUR AGENCY YOUR OFFICE HAVE DETERMINED TO BE IMPROPER. A FAIR QUESTION- I DO REPORT- BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND GOVERNOR OPERATIONS WHEN THESE OCCURRENCES HAPPEN IN MOST INSTANCES WE FIND THAT THE AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT- WHEN WE MADE A DETERMINATION- ACKNOWLEDGES THAT AND GIVES US WHAT'S CALLED A SECTION TWO EIGHTY A NOTIFICATION THEY WILL NO LONGER BE ENFORCING THOSE- IT'S VERY RARE AND HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE I'VE BEEN THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW- WHERE AN AGENCY HAS. REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE FOUND THAT IT'S AN UNDERGROUND REGULATION- BUT THEY'RE ALSO SHOULD BE THAT BROADER OPPORTUNITY IT SHOULDN'T JUST BE WITHIN- ELVES ARE SMALL RESOURCES- INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO SUPERIOR COURT TO ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS WHEN I MAY DISAGREE WITH YOU. AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE THAT TO THE COURT CERTAIN RIGHT BUT IN THE CASES WHERE THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT WHERE YOU'VE ISSUED A DETERMINATION THAT THE REGULATION IS AN UNDERGROUND REGULATION AND WAS IMPROPERLY PROMULGATED UNDER THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT. IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU FIND THAT THERE ARE NO CHIP THERE REALLY AREN'T CHALLENGES ON THE ON THE ON THE NORM IN SUPERIOR COURT. I HAVE SEEN SEPARATE CHALLENGES OR WE HAVEN'T BEEN INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ISSUED A CHANCE BUT NO EVERYONE THAT I HAVE SEEN THIS COME TO US WHERE WE'VE MADE A TERMINATION. THE AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED AND HAS HAS STOPPED ENFORCING THOSE THEY DO THAT THROUGH WHAT WE CALL SECTION TWO EIGHTY WHERE THEY- OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGE- THAT THEY WILL NO LONGER BE ENFORCING THOSE RULES PERFECT WITH THANK YOU FOR DOING WHAT YOU DO AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR- CONFIRMATION- THANK YOU. CAN I ASK A IN TERMS OF WHAT THE INFORMATION I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME THEIR NON UNDERGROUND REGULATION- OF PETITIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW. UNDERGROUND REGULATION PETITIONS AND EIGHT OF THOSE ARE CDC ARE CAN I JUST CORRECT ME IF THAT'S NOT ACCURATE YOU'VE HAD LOTS OF YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH CDC ARE CAN YOU. WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTS FOR SO MANY OF THE UNDERGROUND ELECTION TISH. OR THAT JUST PART OF THAT IS DONE NOW. ISSUE THE- AND FAMILY OUTSIDE COUNSEL FOR THOSE PRISONERS HAVE BEEN A REALLY GOOD JOB EDUCATING- THE PRISONERS AT CDC ARE ON THE METHODS NECESSARY TO CHALLENGE- SO E GET A LARGE VOLUME OF THEM SOMETIMES WE ACCEPT THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE CORRECT. A LOT OF TIMES- THEIR PROCEDURALLY DEFICIENT OR THAT USES AN UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS A LOCAL RULE OR SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS TO FOR A FIGHTING UNDERGROUND REGULATION. SO THE VOLUME IS AS EXPECTED THE HIGHEST FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS BUT- IN LARGE PART IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ALLOW THOSE INMATES TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. THAT'S AN INTERESTING- UNDERSTANDING TO HALF THANK YOU. IF NOTHING FURTHER- LET ME ASK FOLKS IN SUPPORT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. IT YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE GOOD I. WE'VE HAD EXPERIENCE IN THIS- ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM SECRETARY SENATORS BATES BATES AYE MONNING MONNING AYE ROTH ROSS I WILL WILK AYE ATKINS HI. LET ME AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES I A I REALLY HAVE ENJOYED YOUR ENTHUSIASM- TODAY AND IT SHOWS OBVIOUSLY SO UNANIMOUS CONFIRMATION CONGRATULATIONS YOU. NINE YEAH WHAT.
