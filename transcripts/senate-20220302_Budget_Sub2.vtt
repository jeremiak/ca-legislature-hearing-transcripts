SUBMITTING THEIR COMMENTS TO THE

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:53.706
PD. AND THE CQC HAS YET TO TAKE

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:55.641
UP THE PD ADDY BOATING MEETING.

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:57.643
MANY TAKEHOLDERS ON ALL SIDES

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.612
OF THE ISSUE HAVE MADE PUBLIC

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:01.981
COMMENT AT THIRTY MEETINGS. AND

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:04.083
THE COMMISSION CONTINUES

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.684
INTERNAL DELIBERATIONS ON THE

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.186
MATTER. COMMISSIONERS ADVISERS

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:09.455
HAVE TAKEN DOZENS OF SO CALLED

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:12.725
EX PARTE MEETINGS WITH PARTIES

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:14.126
AND STAFF HAS MET FREQUENTLY

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:16.262
WITH PARTIES TO INFORM THESE

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:19.565
DELIBERATIONS. NOW GOING FORWARD

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:22.068
TO SEE IF YOU SEE PLANS TO HEAR

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:25.271
PARTIES ORAL ARGUMENTS. IN AN

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.673
ORAL ARGUMENT DATE THAT HAS YET

TO BE ESTABLISHED. AND ALSO TO

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:32.111
CONSIDER POTENTIAL REVISIONS TO

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.280
THE PROPOSED DECISION. IF I

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.915
COMMISSIONER HAS YET TO ANNOUNCE

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.049
A SPECIFIC TIMELINE FOR A

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:39.552
DECISION BUT THE MATTER IS A TOP

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:42.855
PRIORITY FOR THE COMMISSION.

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:45.491
THAT WAS THE UPDATE THAT I HAD.

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:47.493
FOR TODAY AND BE HAPPY TO TAKE

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:54.066
ANY ANY QUESTIONS. DOLLAR YOU

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:56.435
RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU THANK YOU

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:59.572
FOR YOUR- THE INFORMATION SO I

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:03.576
HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- SO.

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.278
WHAT I READ IN THE IN THE-

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:06.646
INFORMATION THAT WAS AVAILABLE

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.648
TO ME WAS THAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.082
THIS THESE RESOURCES AND THEN

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:13.986
WE'RE GOING TO. ALL PEOPLE-

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:17.390
ACTUALLY LOW INCOME PEOPLE GET.

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:19.191
THEY'RE GONNA CHANGE OVER FROM

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:24.931
GAS TO ELECTRIC OR IS. HELLO

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:26.065
FIVE ON THE WRONG I'M ON THE

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:28.067
WRONG ONE SORRY ABOUT THAT. SO

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:31.103
PEOPLE THAT HAVE SOLAR- ON THEIR

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.105
ROOFTOP AREN'T PAYING FOR THE

00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:35.541
GRID- AT THE SAME RATE TO PEOPLE

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:38.110
THAT DON'T HAVE SOLAR- AND HOW

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:40.513
DO YOU PROPOSE THAT THAT'S FAIR

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:42.315
TO THE PEOPLE THAT THAT. DON'T

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:49.121
HAVE SOLAR. RIGHT. SO THIS IS

00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:53.526
THE BALANCING ACT THAT- THE

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:55.962
COMMISSION IS IN THE PROCESS OF

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:58.097
WORKING THROUGH IN THE PRECEDING

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:00.766
B. TWENTY THIRTEEN STATUTES-

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:03.135
THAT- WE ARE OPERATING WITHIN

00:10:03.202 --> 00:10:09.241
THE BOUNDS OF- PROVIDES THAT THE

00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:12.611
- DEAD DEAD MAN TERRORISTS- MUST

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:16.248
ENSURE THAT THE SOLAR MARKET

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:18.150
CONTINUES TO GROW SUSTAINABLY.

00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:22.088
AND ALSO THAT THE- THE COSTS TO

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:24.857
NON SOLAR CUSTOMERS IS MINIMIZED

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:27.560
AND SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY DAY-

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:28.627
BUT THE CHALLENGE IN THIS

00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:32.198
PROCEEDING AND- AS I NOTED

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:33.733
EARLIER AGAIN JUST AS ROBUST

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:36.502
DEBATE ON ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:38.504
ABOUT HOW BEST TO. HOW BEST TO

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:44.276
STRIKE THAT BALANCE- THE ALJS

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:48.914
PROPOSED DECISION. PROPOSES TO-

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:50.816
ESTABLISH OUT WHAT'S CALLED A

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:53.753
NET BILLING TERRORIST. THAT HAS

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.721
FOUR KEY COMPONENTS THE FIRST

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:57.890
COMPONENT WHICH HEY MATT BILLING

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:00.860
CUSTOMERS OR NEW SOLAR CUSTOMERS

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:01.794
FOR THE ELECTRICITY THAT THEY

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:04.663
EXPORT TO THE GRAD BASED ON ITS

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.134
VALUE TO THE GRAD- CURRENTLY-

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.469
BAD ENERGY METERING CUSTOMERS

00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:12.772
ARE ARE PAID ESSENTIALLY THE-

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:16.275
RETAIL RATE- FOR- ELECTRICITY

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:19.211
AND SO- THE PROPOSED DECISION. I

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:21.447
PROPOSES TO PAY BASED ON THE

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:23.249
VALUE TO THE GRID AS MEASURED BY

00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:24.850
THE AVOIDED COST THE UTILITY

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:26.619
WOULD OTHERWISE PAY FOR CLEAN

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:28.954
ENERGY ELSEWHERE. THE SECOND

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:31.190
COMPONENT IS THAT- THE NET

00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:33.893
BILLING TARIFF WOULD CHARGE- SO

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:36.295
NEW SOLAR CUSTOMERS FOR THE

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:39.098
ELECTRICITY THEY RECEIVED FROM

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:40.900
THE GRAD BASED ON- AT A TIME OF

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:42.635
USE TARIFF THAT HAS A HIGH

00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:45.104
DIFFERENTIAL. WHAT THIS WOULD DO

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:46.138
IS IT WOULD INCENTIVIZE THOSE

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.873
CUSTOMERS TO INSTALL MORE

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.243
STORAGE- AND DISTORT THE SOLAR

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.778
ENERGY AND SHIFT THEIR EXPORTS

00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:59.585
TO LATER IN THE DAY WHEN IT HAS. MORE VALUE TO ALL RATEPAYERS.

00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:01.020
TEN THIRTY IS THAT IT WILL

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:04.090
CREATE A- JUST CHARGE- WHICH HAS

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:06.425
BEEN- CALLED OUT THERE IN THE

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:08.360
PUBLIC DISCOURSE BY SOME AS A

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:11.697
SOLAR TAX- AND THAT WOULD BE

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:13.432
BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE SOLAR

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:15.401
SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT NET

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:17.203
BILLING CUSTOMERS ARE PAYING THE

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:19.004
SAME AMOUNT OF FIXED COSTS OF

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:21.941
THE ELECTRIC RED- AS AS NON.

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:24.310
SOLAR CUSTOMERS AND THEN OUT

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:26.479
FORCEFULLY I'M THAT BILLING

00:12:26.545 --> 00:12:29.582
TERRACE THAT IS WHAT'S PROPOSED

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:30.916
WHAT ARE PROVIDING A MARKET

00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:32.651
TRANSITION CREDIT OR OR A

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.153
SUBSIDY THAT THE CUSTOMER

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.355
RECEIVES FOR TEN YEARS SO THAT

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:38.057
THE CUSTOMER CAN PAY BACK THE

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:41.393
COST OF THEIR OF THEIR- SOLAR-

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.262
PLUS STORAGE ENERGY SYSTEM IN

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:45.197
LESS THAN TEN YEARS. AND THIS

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:46.365
WOULD ENSURE THAT THE INDUSTRY

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.667
CONTINUES TO GROW- AND THAT

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.736
ROOFTOP SOLAR REMAINS ECONOMIC

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:52.071
BUT THAT CREDIT WOULD STEP DOWN

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:55.441
OVER TIME SO. AS A NEW CUSTOMER-

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:58.744
TODAY WOULD GET- WILL GET HIGHER

00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:01.413
SUBSIDIES AND I KNEW CUSTOMER

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.916
NEW SOLAR CUSTOMER- NEXT YEAR

00:13:03.983 --> 00:13:06.285
AND FOLLOWING IT STEPPED DOWN

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:09.488
OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. SO THIS

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:13.859
IS- HOW THE ALJ HAS PROPOSED TO

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.594
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF COURSE

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:16.996
THERE ARE MANY PROPOSALS THAT

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:17.463
ARE ON THE RECORD AND

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.566
PROCEEDING- BETTER- BEING

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:25.237
CONSIDERED. AS PART OF THIS

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:26.505
PROCESS. SO WHAT ABOUT THE EGGS

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:30.209
. SOLAR ALL. ROUTE OR EVEN

00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:32.144
COMMERCIAL I GUESS SOLAR IT'S SO

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:33.112
THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:34.180
GOING TO HAVE TO BEAT THEIR

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:35.814
THEIR EXCLUDED FROM THIS PROCESS

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:41.854
EVEN THOUGH- THERE. GETTING A

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:43.756
SUBSIDIZED BASICALLY THEY'RE

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:45.925
SUBSIDIZED BY THE LOW INCOME

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:48.427
RATEPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA THAT

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.495
CAN'T AFFORD TO PUT SOLAR ON

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:54.066
THEIR HOME. RIGHT SO AND IN

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:54.867
TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THE

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:56.368
COMMISSION REVISED ITS NOT

00:13:56.435 --> 00:14:00.239
ENERGY METERING POLICY- THE

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:03.375
APPROACH THAT WAS TAKEN WAS TO-

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:06.345
TO ESSENTIALLY LOCK IN THE- THEN

00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:07.947
THAT ENERGY METERING ARRANGEMENT

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:10.549
FOR A PERIOD OF TWENTY YEARS.

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:12.618
AND THE INTENTION BEHIND THIS

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:13.953
WAS THE PART WAS TO PROVIDE SOME

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:15.254
STABILITY TO THE MARKET PLACE

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:17.489
AND ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS WHEN

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:19.892
MAKING AN INVESTMENT THEY- ARE

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:22.161
ABLE TO ACHIEVE A REASONABLE PAY

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:24.430
BACK PERIOD. THE PROPOSED

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:27.233
DECISION OF THAT MINISTRY OF LAW

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:29.335
JUDGE I WOULD PROPOSE TO CHANGE

00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:34.707
THAT- FROM A TWENTY YEAR- A LOCK

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:36.375
IN OF THAT ARRANGEMENT TO A

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:37.576
FIFTEEN YEAR AND SO AFTER

00:14:37.643 --> 00:14:40.312
FIFTEEN YEARS- ON THE EXISTING

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:44.183
SOLAR CUSTOMERS WOULD- WOULD. GO

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.654
ON TO THE- THE NEW MAPS BILLING

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:49.855
STRUCTURE. OKAY SERVER MY LAST

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:51.090
QUESTION IS I'M VERY FRUSTRATED

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:53.826
BY THE FACT THAT. THAT PEOPLE

00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:55.594
WHO CAN'T AFFORD SOLAR ARE

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:57.129
PAYING FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN'T

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:59.098
CAN'T AFFORD IT AND THEN THERE

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:00.032
GET THEIR RATES ARE ACTUALLY

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:02.101
GOING OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:05.404
MAINTAIN THE GRID. AND THAT

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:06.505
FOLKS HAVE SOLAR DON'T SO WHAT

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:08.674
IT WHAT IS THE- I GUESS. THE

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:09.908
FRUSTRATION COMES FROM THE FACT

00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:11.443
THAT THERE'S A P. YOU SEE JUST

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.711
HOW THE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:14.813
DO THIS WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE THIS

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.816
LEGISLATIVE BODY- THE ACTING ON

00:15:17.883 --> 00:15:20.119
THIS ON THESE ISSUES OR IS THIS

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:21.320
JUST GOING TO HAPPEN THROUGH THE

00:15:21.387 --> 00:15:26.859
ADMINISTRATION. RIGHT SO THE CQC

00:15:26.925 --> 00:15:29.428
IT. DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY THAT

00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:32.831
WAS GIVEN IT GIVEN TO IT. UNDER

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:35.801
THE TWENTY THIRTEEN STATUTE

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:37.803
ASSEMBLY BILL THREE TWENTY SEVEN

WHICH PROVIDES THE- THE

00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:42.908
GOVERNANCE FOR THAT NET ENERGY

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:45.311
METERING PROGRAM. AND WITHIN

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:49.581
THAT STATUTE- THE COMMISSION

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:54.320
WAS- WAS DIRECTED. TO ACCESS

00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:55.554
THAT THE COMMISSION MAY REVISE

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.890
THE- THE TERRACE THAT'S

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.692
APPROPRIATE TO ACHIEVE A NUMBER

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:01.427
OF A JACK OBJECTIVES THAT WERE

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:03.662
STALLED OUT IN THE IN THIS- THAT

00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:04.630
SECTION OF STATUTE WHICH

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:08.267
INCLUDED ENSURING THAT THE THAT

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:11.503
TERRORISTS- ENSURES THAT THEIR

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.838
CUSTOMERS CITED RENEWABLE

GROWTH AMONG RESIDENTIAL

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:21.146
CUSTOMERS AND DISADVANTAGED

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:24.350
COMMUNITIES- IT ALSO REQUIRES

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:26.719
THAT- ENSURED THAT THE TERROR

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:28.754
YOU MADE AVAILABLE TO ELIGIBLE

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:31.056
CUSTOMER GENERATORS THAT'S BASED

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:33.092
ON THE COST AND THE BENEFITS. OF

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.226
THE RENEWABLE ELECTRICAL

00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:36.328
GENERATION FACILITY AND THAT

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.364
THAT TOTAL BENEFITS OF THE

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.566
TERRORISTS TO ALL CUSTOMERS AND

00:16:40.632 --> 00:16:43.168
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM OUR PROXIMITY

00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:45.671
EQUAL TO THE COSTS- IT ALSO AS

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:47.940
REGARDS THE POSSIBILITY OF A OF

00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:50.542
A FIXED CHARGE- FOR SOLAR

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:52.911
CUSTOMERS SWITCH AND IT HAS BEEN

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:53.946
ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL

00:16:54.012 --> 00:16:56.315
ELEMENTS OF THE- DECISION. THE

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:59.051
STATUTE PROVIDES THAT- BAD AT

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:00.719
ANY SIX CHARGE FOR RESIDENTIAL

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:03.522
CUSTOMERS GENERATORS I SHALL BE

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:06.392
AUTHORIZED ONLY IN A RULE MAKING

00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:08.827
PROCEEDING- AND THAT- THE

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:09.962
COMMISSION SHALL ENSURE THAT

00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:11.130
THOSE I'VE GOT THE CUSTOMER

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:12.531
GENERATORS ARE PROVIDE ELECTRIC

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:13.966
SERVICE AT RATES THAT ARE JUST

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:16.168
AND REASONABLE. SO THOSE ARE

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:17.403
SOME OF THE PARAMETERS THAT THAT

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:20.139
THE LEGISLATURE HAS- PROVIDED TO

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:22.341
THE COMMISSION. TO GUIDE OUR

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:27.679
PROCESS- ESTABLISHING. A I JUST

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:28.881
AND REASONABLE CARE. BUT EVEN

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:31.016
THAT THE- COMMENT I WANT TO

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:33.252
MAYBE PUT IT IN THE TERMS IT IT.

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:35.487
JUST FROM A FROM MY SIDE OF. THE

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:36.989
SITUATION IS THAT WE BASICALLY

00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:38.223
THIS LEGISLATURE GAVE THE POWER

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.092
TO. THE PC WHICH IS UP

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:42.661
APPOINTED. BY THE BY THE

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.363
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.898
APPOINTS THOSE FOLKS AND WE GIVE

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:48.133
THEM FREE REIGN TO BE ABLE TO GO

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.869
AND CREATE THE SYSTEM WE HAVE

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:51.970
PUT A SYSTEM RIGHT NOW THAT WE

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:53.439
HAVE. IS IF YOU HAVE ROFTOP

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:55.674
SOLAR OR YOU HAVE SOLAR AND YOU

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.743
CAN AFFORD IT. THAT YOU'RE

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.678
GETTING A BENEFIT AND THE LOW

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:00.913
INCOME PEOPLE THAT CAN'T AFFORD

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:02.548
SOLAR OR HAVE THE MEANS TO HAVE

00:18:02.614 --> 00:18:03.816
SOLAR ARE PAYING FOR THE

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:06.118
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THAT. A SOLAR

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:09.455
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY- THE

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:10.823
WRONG AND THAT'S OUR TWENTY YEAR

00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:13.725
CONTRACTS THAT AS WE KNOW-

00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:15.160
ELECTRICITY RATES ARE

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:17.963
SKYROCKETING IN CALIFORNIA DUE

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.565
TO MANY THINGS A GRID IT'S

00:18:19.631 --> 00:18:21.333
HASN'T BEEN MAINTAINED. A

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.570
WILDFIRE AND- JUST QUITE FRANKLY

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:26.605
THE COST OF GENERATION AND THE

00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:29.041
ABILITY TO BILL TO GET WHAT WE-

00:18:29.107 --> 00:18:29.942
ARE- GET THE AMOUNT THAT WE

00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:32.277
NEED. AND SO I THINK IT'S-

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:33.745
BEHOOVES THE LEGISLATURE TO BE

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:35.080
INVOLVED IN THIS AND NOT JUST

00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:36.882
HANDED OVER TO. APPOINTED

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.651
BODIES- THAT CAN CAN MANIPULATE

00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:42.020
THIS SO WHY ARE WE EVEN HAVE

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:42.821
THIS CONVERSATION IF THIS IF

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:46.492
THIS IS IT YOUR- AT THE PUC'S

00:18:46.558 --> 00:18:56.668
LEVEL. SO WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF

00:18:56.735 --> 00:18:59.404
A PROCESS RIGHT NOW- OF REACHING

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:00.672
A DECISION ON THESE ISSUES AND

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:02.574
WE HAVE A ROBUST RECORD THAT HAS

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:05.744
BEEN. COLLECTED OVER THE LAST

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:08.080
EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR SO AS I WAS-

00:19:08.146 --> 00:19:10.048
OUTLINING EARLIER ONE OF THE KEY

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:12.618
FACTORS THAT I THINK THAT. THE

00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:14.920
COMMISSION- I TOOK INTO

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:17.856
CONSIDERATION AS IT FIRST-

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.291
ESTABLISHED REFORMS TO THE NET

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:20.759
ENERGY METERING PROGRAM IN

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:23.929
TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND NOW AGAIN AS

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.331
WE ARE REVIEWING THE MATTER IS

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:28.066
TO REALLY HAVE GOOD DATA. TO BE

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:30.636
ABLE TO- MAKE THESE DECISIONS

00:19:30.702 --> 00:19:33.338
AND THAT- AND INFORMED FASHION.

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:37.242
AND SO- THE LOOK BACK STUDY THAT

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:39.645
WAS CONDUCTED. AND ENTERED INTO

00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:41.179
THE RECORD OF THE OF THE

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:42.714
PRECEDING THAT WE'RE NOW

00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:44.516
UNDERTAKING WAS REALLY A KEY

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.151
PIECE OF THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:47.886
INFORMATION. OUT TO THE DEGREE

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:50.989
THAT WE HAVE- AND TWENTY SIXTEEN

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:52.257
WHEN WE FIRST REVIEWED THE

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:53.992
TARIFFS AND SO- WE BELIEVE THAT

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:55.594
WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST RECORD.

00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:59.331
OUT TODAY TO BE ABLE TO- TO.

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:01.767
MAKE FURTHER CHANGES TO THAT-

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:06.271
THE PROGRAM- BASED ON SOLID

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:06.805
INFORMATION. WELL I WOULD

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.006
SUGGEST THAT IN FUTURE THAT YOU

00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:12.210
PUT ON. HAVE THE ABILITY. TO AS

00:20:12.277 --> 00:20:13.145
INFLATION GOES UP WHICH WE'RE

00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:15.447
SEEING. INFLATION WENT UP SEVEN

00:20:15.514 --> 00:20:17.683
POINT 7% IN THE LAST YEAR YOU'RE

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:18.951
GONNA SEE THAT OVER THE NEXT

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:21.019
OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. YOU

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:22.988
NEED TO HAVE. THE ABILITY FOR

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.290
INFLATION TO BE CALCULATED INTO

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:26.725
THE PROGRAM SO THAT. THE

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.560
DISADVANTAGED FOLKS THAT YOU.

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:30.262
THAT I HEAR ALL DAY LONG ARE YOU

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:31.930
SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING HELP IN

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:33.365
CALIFORNIA AREN'T PAYING FOR THE

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:35.400
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO

00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:37.436
PUT SOLAR ON THEIR HOMES THIS IS

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:41.440
REALLY. A TRAGEDY THAT LOW

00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:42.708
INCOME PEOPLE ARE PAYING. A

00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:44.409
HIGHER RATE. FOR THE

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:45.944
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SOMEBODY WHO

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:47.546
HAS SOLAR SO WE NEED TO PUT IN

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:49.214
THE BILL YOU HAVE INFLATION SO

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:49.948
THAT THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:52.117
ACTUALLY GETTING. SOLAR ARE

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:53.318
PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE BECAUSE

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:55.087
THEY'RE NOT. AND THEY'RE

00:20:55.153 --> 00:20:57.389
BALANCING THE BOOKS ON THE BACKS

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:59.024
OF. HARD WORKING POOR PEOPLE.

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:03.362
AND THAT'S WRONG. ALL RIGHT WHEN

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:07.032
YOU CLICK ON THAT SIR. LET'S

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.767
FOLLOW UP ON THE LINE OF

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:10.002
QUESTIONING THAT THE CENTER HAVE

00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:11.837
A LEG TO BRING IN THE ALLEY-

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:16.108
BECAUSE- I VOTED FOR. AB THREE

00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:17.676
TWO SEVEN BACK IN TWENTY

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:19.878
THIRTEEN AND WE CERTAINLY

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.146
IMPLEMENTED THAT METERING AND

00:21:21.213 --> 00:21:23.115
ALLOWED FOR A SUBSEQUENT

00:21:23.181 --> 00:21:25.083
REVISIONS IN IT BUT HOW MUCH

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.019
LATITUDE DOES THE P. YOU SEE

00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:28.820
HAVE TO CONTINUE MODIFYING THE

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:46.038
NET. ENERGY METERING

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.423
IDEA OF DIFFERENT CRITERIA THAT

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:05.857
THE PC I SHOULD BE USING WHEN

00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:06.692
THE TERM INTERNET ENERGY

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:08.493
METERING STRUCTURE AND SO I

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.629
THINK THERE'S- OTHER THE

00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:12.230
EXISTING KIND OF STATUTE

00:22:12.297 --> 00:22:13.732
INSTRUCTOR DOES GIVE THEM THE

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:15.233
AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT CONTINUED

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.302
TO MAKE CHANGES TO TRY TO COMPLY

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:20.205
WITH- KIND OF THE CRITERIA- AND

00:22:20.272 --> 00:22:21.073
THE STRUCTURE AS OUTLINED BY THE

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:22.374
LEGISLATURE. OF COURSE THE

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:24.209
LEGISLATURE ALWAYS HAS SORT OF

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:27.379
THE OPTION TO- CHANGE OR MODIFY

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:29.047
THAT. I'M NOT AUTHORITY GOING

00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:31.383
FORWARD IF IT FEELS LIKE SHE

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:32.751
NEEDS TO UPDATE THAT IN ORDER TO

00:22:32.818 --> 00:22:34.453
KIND OF ACHIEVED A DIFFERENT MIX

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:36.054
OF BALANCE OF POLICY GOALS AND

00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:37.689
SO- THAT'S CERTAINLY SORT OF AN

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:38.790
OPTION THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:40.859
CHANGE BUT WE THINK THAT- ORDER

00:22:40.926 --> 00:22:42.561
STATUS OF THE CURRENT. STRUCTURE

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:44.429
SORT OF YOU KNOW PROVIDES

00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:45.664
DIFFERENT CRITERIA FOR EACH OF

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:47.265
THE COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH THE

00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:48.900
STRUCTURE AND AS MISTER BAKER

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:51.069
MENTIONS REALLY DOES KIND OF

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:53.371
INVOLVED THIS SORT OF BALANCING

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:54.406
OF DIFFERENCE- GOALS THAT THE

00:22:54.473 --> 00:22:56.441
LEGISLATURE IS LAID OUT FOR THE

00:22:56.508 --> 00:23:00.645
PC. WHEN ESTABLISHING A

00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:01.580
TERRORIST. I GUESS THE- IS DOES

00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:03.582
THIS DEBATE ON THEM REALLY TO BE

00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:05.450
A ZERO SUM GAME. DOES IT DOES IT

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:07.319
DOES DO WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW

00:23:07.385 --> 00:23:08.720
THERE ARE BENEFITS OF HAVING

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:11.389
ROOFTOP SOLAR. FOR A CLEANER

00:23:11.456 --> 00:23:14.893
ENERGY MIX THAT WE HAPPENED

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.895
INFORMATION BEFORE THE P. YOU

00:23:16.962 --> 00:23:18.096
SEE OF THE- ADVANTAGES THAT

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:21.867
WE'VE HAD- BUT IS IT POSSIBLE.

00:23:21.933 --> 00:23:23.835
TO DO MORE FOR LOW INCOME- THE

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:26.138
COMMUNITIES IF THAT'S THE RIGHT

00:23:26.204 --> 00:23:29.141
THING TO DO IS. MY COLLEAGUE-

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:31.977
AND MOVE THE INDUSTRY IN A IN A

00:23:32.043 --> 00:23:35.747
REGIMEN OF MATTER TO- AVOID THIS

00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:37.916
AVOID THE COSTS. THAT WE THAT WE

00:23:37.983 --> 00:23:39.885
HAVE THAT DOESN'T REALLY. AT

00:23:39.951 --> 00:23:41.253
LEAST WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS

00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:42.988
GONNA BE THEDEATH KNELL TO THE-

00:23:43.054 --> 00:23:45.090
TO THE INDUSTRY. YES SIR IS IT

00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:49.661
POSSIBLE TO HAVE. THE BEST OF

00:23:49.728 --> 00:23:52.497
BOTH WORLDS AND MOVE GRADUALLY.

00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:56.468
I MEAN I THINK- I THINK IT ALL

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:59.638
KIND OF COMES DOWN TO BALANCING

00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:02.374
I MEAN THERE MAY BE A DIFFERENT

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.576
WAYS- TO KIND OF STRUCTURE

00:24:04.643 --> 00:24:07.212
PROGRAMS IN A WAY THAT YOU TRY

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:09.681
TO AVOID SOME OF THE- KIND OF

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:11.716
SHIFTING COSTS TO LOWER INCOME

00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:13.418
HOUSEHOLDS AND KIND OF ESTABLISH

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:15.220
A STRUCTURE FOR THAT AND THEN

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:15.854
THERE'S THERE COULD BE SORT OF

00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:17.622
ROOM FOR A NOTHER DISCUSSION

00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:20.292
THAT'S RELATED ALSO ON KIND OF

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:22.327
HOW TO PROMOTE SOLAR ON LOW

00:24:22.394 --> 00:24:24.462
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND FOR LOW

00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:25.063
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FOR EXAMPLE

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:27.632
AND SO ANY KIND OF A LOT OF THE

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:29.100
CONVERSATION COMES DOWN TO. YOU

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:30.869
KNOW WHAT SH FINANCING STRUCTURE

00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:33.371
YOU WANT TO USE TO TRY TO

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:35.173
PROMOTE- AN INCREASE IN SOLAR

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.976
ADOPTION AND THE SOLAR INDUSTRY-

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:39.778
ANY KIND OF ROOFTOP SOLAR AND

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:41.479
WHETHER YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.949
MUCH YOU WANT TO RELY ON KIND OF

00:24:44.015 --> 00:24:46.484
THE HISTORIC IN EXISTING

00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:47.953
STRUCTURE OF USING- KIND OF THE

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:50.388
NAME TERRORISTS TO DO THAT WHICH

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:51.489
DOES HAVE- SOME. POTENTIAL

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:52.858
REGRESSIVE EFFECTS VERSUS

00:24:52.924 --> 00:24:53.925
RELYING ON OTHER KIND OF

00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:56.094
FINANCING STRUCTURES TO ACHIEVE

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:58.763
THOSE TYPES OF- GOALS OF

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.765
PROMOTING SOLAR. YOU SEE ON THIS

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:03.134
AVOIDED COST VALUE DO YOU SEE A

00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:05.537
GLIDE PATH THAT WE COULD PROCEED

00:25:05.604 --> 00:25:08.006
OR IS IT JUST. FOR CHANGING

00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:10.609
UNDER I GUESS UNDER THE

00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:11.776
AUTHORITY WITH A. B. THREE TWO

00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:18.817
SEVEN. RIGHT SO- ONE OF THE- THE

00:25:18.884 --> 00:25:20.585
KEY ASPECTS THAT THAT THAT WE

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:25.023
ARE- EXAMINING IS HOW TO BRING

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:28.293
THE- I'LL MOUNT THAT IS PAID TO

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.363
THE- BEST SOLAR CUSTOMERS ARE

00:25:31.429 --> 00:25:34.032
CLOSER TO WHAT THE VALUE IS FOR

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:35.500
ALL ALL RATE PAYERS AND THAT'S

00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:37.402
WHY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ELEMENTS

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:40.505
THAT'S BEING EXAMINED IS TO PAY

00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:43.742
OUT BASED ON OF WHAT IT COSTS-

00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:46.745
BUT TO- TO GET THAT RIGHT OFF

00:25:46.811 --> 00:25:48.847
THE BAT IT COULD BE TOO ABRUPT

00:25:48.914 --> 00:25:51.416
FOR THE FOR THE INDUSTRY TO BEAR

00:25:51.483 --> 00:25:53.885
FROM THE- ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE

00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:56.021
BECAUSE- FOR THE- IS THAT-

00:25:56.087 --> 00:25:58.089
DISTRIBUTED. ROOFTOP SOLAR IS

00:25:58.156 --> 00:26:01.693
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN- THE- YOU

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.796
KNOW UTILITY SCALE ALTERNATIVE.

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.498
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:26:06.564 --> 00:26:09.367
WITH- WITH EMPLOYEE COSTS AND SO

00:26:09.434 --> 00:26:10.669
ON TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A

00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:12.637
COST DIFFERENTIAL THERE YOU KNOW

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:13.939
THERE'S A SPOT TO GET THERE. AND

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:16.608
SO THEN HOW DO WE HOW DO WE WHY

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:17.876
NOT DOWN. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

00:26:17.943 --> 00:26:19.344
WHY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES ARE

00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:21.379
BEING EXAMINED IN THE PRECEDING

00:26:21.446 --> 00:26:24.049
. ABOUT HOW TO PROVIDE SOME KIND

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:25.984
OF A SUBSIDY AND THEN- WIND THAT

00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:27.886
SUBSIDY DOWN OVER TIME YOU YOU

00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:30.588
MIGHT LOOK AT THIS SIMILARLY AS-

00:26:30.655 --> 00:26:32.791
THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED THE

00:26:32.857 --> 00:26:34.759
CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE- A

00:26:34.826 --> 00:26:35.927
SUBSIDY PROGRAM FOR ROOFTOP

00:26:35.994 --> 00:26:38.530
SOLAR AT ONE ONE TIME. AND AND

00:26:38.596 --> 00:26:40.799
THAT WAS STRUCTURED TO BASICALLY

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:43.401
HAVE THE ASSETS TO BE HIGHER- IN

00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:44.836
THE BEGINNING AND THEN WIND GOES

00:26:44.903 --> 00:26:47.472
DOWN OVER TIME WITH THE- GOAL OF

00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:50.809
HAVING THE HISTORY- SEEK. COST

00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:52.844
EFFICIENCIES AND BRING THE COST

00:26:52.911 --> 00:26:54.512
OF THE TECHNOLOGY DOWN OVER TIME

00:26:54.579 --> 00:26:56.247
SO THAT THE SUBSIDIES TO BE

00:26:56.314 --> 00:26:58.516
REDUCED I MEAN WE DON'T WANT TO

00:26:58.583 --> 00:27:02.120
EXPERIENCE THAT THE GERMAN-

00:27:02.187 --> 00:27:04.522
EXPERIMENT RIGHT TO SHUT DOWN

00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:06.024
ALL THEIR NUCLEAR ENERGY BECAUSE

00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:07.225
THEY HAVE A FOR POLITICAL

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:09.627
DECISION AND THEN MOVED TO COLE

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:11.129
WE'D LIKE TO YOU KNOW I WHETHER

00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:13.131
IT'S- REAL OR NOT. WE'RE SAYING

00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:15.033
THAT WE SHUT DOWN YOU KNOW THE

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.002
ROOFTOP SOLAR INDUSTRY AND

00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:18.403
PEOPLE MOVE TO BIO MASS

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.572
ELECTRICITY THERE'S A THERE

00:27:20.638 --> 00:27:23.875
THERE THERE I CAN I AM. I LIKE

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:24.909
THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE HAVE

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:26.411
A WE'RE GOING TO BE DELIVERED

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:27.712
CHIP AND WE'RE GOING TO DO A

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:29.047
BALANCING ACT BUT THERE'S

00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:30.281
GREATER BENEFITS TO THE

00:27:30.348 --> 00:27:32.884
COMMUNITY AT LARGE- I GUESS SO

00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:39.891
WHAT'S UP. NEXT I SAW THE GUY

00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:40.792
WHO SAW THE GRAPH. STAKEHOLDER

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.694
IN. IT THIS. THIS WE'RE GOING

00:27:42.761 --> 00:27:43.962
THROUGH BEFORE WE GET TO A FINAL

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:45.897
DECISION- HOW HOW IS THAT

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:46.965
PROCESS WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE

00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:49.401
THE PROCESS GOING FORWARD NOW IN

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:53.171
MARCH. I GUESS THE TIME LINE.

00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:56.274
RIGHT SO- THAT THE COMMISSION

INCLUDING THE PROGRAM'S. GONNA

00:45:42.606 --> 00:45:44.108

TO THE EXTENT NEAR TERM

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:48.739
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS ARE

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:52.609
PRIORITY. AND THAT KIND OF I

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:54.978
KNOW. YOU JUST THAT. IT IS ONE

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:56.547
OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE.

00:46:56.613 --> 00:46:58.248

TON AND SO THESE ARE. ALL THESE

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:05.856
ARE RELATIVELY HIGH COMPARED TO

00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:06.957

KEEP IN MIND BUT- I GET. A COST

00:47:12.996 --> 00:47:14.965

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:26.710
SUCH AS FAR AWAY. AND THE

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:27.778
FORMER. APPEAR TO BE. A MUCH

00:47:27.844 --> 00:47:29.646
MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER

PRO- ON THAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY

00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:32.249
ADVANCEMENTS SIDE THIS IS MORE

00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:33.750
OF A KIND OF A QUALITATIVE

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:34.818
ASSESSMENT BUT- YOU KNOW TO THE

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:37.321
EXTENT THAT SUCH. A PRIORITY ON

00:47:37.387 --> 00:47:37.955
KIND OF ADVANCING TECHNOLOGIES

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:39.489
TO MEET SOME OF THE MORE LONG

00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:40.924
TERM. GHG AND AIR QUALITY GOALS

00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:43.193
THEN- THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.595
PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR KIND OF

00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:45.495
HEAVY DUTY PILOTS AND

00:47:45.562 --> 00:47:47.164
DEMONSTRATIONS AND DOCTORS FOR

00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:48.665
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES WHETHER. THE

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:51.568
TECHNOLOGY IS MORE ON HOW THE

00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:52.703
EARLIER STAGE. FINALLY IF A

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:54.638
PRIORITY IS REALLY ENSURING THAT

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:55.205
THOSE AIR QUALITY BENEFITS

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:56.773
ACCRUE MOSTLY TO DISADVANTAGED

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.507

COMMUNITIES- THE LEGISLATURE

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:00.611
MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW

00:48:00.677 --> 00:48:02.379
TARGETING FUNDS TO PROGRAMS THAT

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:03.947
REDUCE. POLLUTANTS COST

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:05.082
EFFECTIVE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

00:48:05.148 --> 00:48:08.018
WAY AND WHERE THE MAJORITY OF

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:09.119
THE BENEFITS ARE IN THOSE

00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:12.422
COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE.

00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:14.057
PROGRAMS RELATIVELY OF ON THEIR

00:48:15.325 --> 00:48:16.560
THAT MONEY IS SPENT SOME KIND OF

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:18.895
PRIORITY POPULATIONS SO. I THINK

00:48:18.962 --> 00:48:20.697
THAT'S OUR ATTEMPT TO KIND OF

00:48:20.764 --> 00:48:23.166
JUST MAYBE SORT OF FRAME SOME OF

LEGISLATURE. FACES DEPENDING ON

00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:27.871
ITS PRIORITIES AND HOW IT WANTS

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:28.905
TO ALLOCATE FUNDING. SO I'M NOT

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.807

00:51:01.858 --> 00:51:03.360
YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:04.561
POTENTIAL TO BECOME A MULTI YEAR

00:51:04.628 --> 00:51:05.495
FUNDING PROPOSALS HAVE THE

00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:06.997
POTENTIAL TO REDUCE LEGISLATIVE

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:07.798
OVERSIGHT BECAUSE THE

00:51:07.864 --> 00:51:09.299
ADMINISTRATION. DOESN'T HAVETO

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:10.634
COME BACK OUT WITH A KIND OF A

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.836
NEW BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL NEXT

00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:13.837
YEAR- AND SO THAT YOU HAVE THE

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:15.272
POTENTIAL TO REDUCE OVERSIGHT

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:17.374
THERE ARE SOME WAYS AROUND THAT

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:18.108
BY. INCLUDING SOME REPORTING

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:18.975
REQUIREMENTS AND OVERSIGHT

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:21.912
REQUIREMENTS- BUT ONE THING I

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:23.480
THINK THAT'S JUST KIND OF A

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:25.582
TRADE OFF OF THAT MULTI YEAR

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:26.483
APPROACH THE OTHER OF COURSE IS

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:27.951
IT DOES CREATE ADDITIONAL

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:29.019
GENERAL GENERAL FUND PRESSURES.

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:30.053
IN THE FUTURE YOUR SENSE OF

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.289
POLITICAL POINT STATUES JUST

00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:38.695
THINK. ABOUT- ABOUT THAT TRADE

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:39.763
OFF. SO BUT TO THE EXTENT THE

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:42.232
ONE. DOES PROVIDE KIND OF MULTI

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:43.333
YEAR FUNDING PART OF THE PACKAGE

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.901
WE DO. THAT PRIORITIZE. THAT FOR

00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:45.635
PROGRAMS WHERE IT KIND OF CAN

00:51:45.702 --> 00:51:47.704
PROVIDE SOME OF THOSE MARKETS

00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:49.105
SIGNAL BENEFITS TO BUSINESSES

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:49.773
MAKING US LONG TERM INVESTMENT

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.007
DECISIONS SUCH AS HEAVY DUTY.

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:53.610
AND OFFER A DOCTRINES. SO I WILL

THE TABLE THE WORLD DOESN'T HEAT

00:54:07.944 --> 00:54:10.213
UP RATHER THAN HAVING THIS NET

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.482
ZERO IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE IF I

00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:14.651
HAD TO JUST CHOOSE ONE I KNOW

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:15.719
ONE BALANCING AND I KNOW I'M

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.020
SACRIFICING THEIR QUALITY I'M

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:18.955
I'M I'M ACTUALLY SAYING IT OUT

00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:20.156
LOUD. SO THAT THE AIR BOARD IN

00:54:20.223 --> 00:54:21.891
THE ENERGY COMMISSION CAN HEAR

IT DON'T WE HAVE A

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:25.061
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO EVERYTHING

WE CAN TO REDUCE THE HEATING OF

FIVE DEGREES AND THIS AND THAT

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:34.604
YOUR FIRST CRITERIA MISTER.

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:36.306
BROWN BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:38.942
JUST A POLICY CALLED FOR THE

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:40.377
LEGISLATURE AND SO- I THINK

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:41.945
DIFFERENT PEOPLE CAN KIND OF SEE

00:54:42.012 --> 00:54:43.513

DIFFERENTLY I MEAN I THINK IT'S-

00:54:45.582 --> 00:54:46.850
CERTAINLY REASONABLE TO KIND OF

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:49.285
HAVE A NEAR TERM GREENHOUSE GAS

00:54:49.352 --> 00:54:51.621
REDUCTIONS AS A- AS A KIND OF

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:54.024
CORE AND KIND OF TOP PRIORITY-

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:55.792

00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:57.260
SOMETHING THAT KIND OF THE STAFF

00:54:57.327 --> 00:54:58.561

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:01.765
HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE

00:55:01.831 --> 00:55:02.899
LEGISLATURE WE DO THAT IT'S KIND

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:04.501
OF A POLICY CALLED THE

00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:06.036
LEGISLATURE IS TRYING TO.

00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:07.237
BALANCE ALL THOSE DIFFERENT

00:55:07.303 --> 00:55:07.904
GOALS AND PRIORITIES BUT- WE DO

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:09.572
THAT KIND OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT

00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:10.840
THOSE ARE AND TRYING TO BE AS

00:55:10.907 --> 00:55:12.642
CLEAR AS POSSIBLE ABOUT. KIND OF

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:13.743
YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH OF THOSE

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.212
PRIORITIES IS KIND OF REALLY AT

00:55:16.279 --> 00:55:17.947
THE TOP OF THE LIST AND THEN

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:19.082
KIND OF STRUCTURING YOUR BUDGET

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:20.083
PACKAGE KIND OF AROUND THAT.

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:21.918
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. SO WE

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:23.253
HAVE. THE PRESIDENT'S

00:55:23.319 --> 00:55:24.287

00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:49.999
USED IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE

00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:51.734
EITHER TO KIND OF LEVERAGE

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:52.635

ON THE FEDERAL SIDE THERE ARE

00:58:11.955 --> 00:58:13.489

THE END OF SEPTEMBER- THAT

00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:48.758
FORMULA GRANT FUNDING TO CREATE

00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:50.560
THAT DIFFICULT WORK WE SPENT. A

LOT OF PARAMETERS ON THE POWER.

00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:55.298
OF THE CHARGERS. AND THEN THEY

00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:57.133
NEED ALTERNATIVE FUEL CORRIDORS.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.303
SO YOU KNOW. THAT ONE IS GOING

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:00.870

THAT WE BUILT UPON MY- PACKAGE.

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:07.904
ON INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE- WHAT

WE'RE FORTUNATE TO GET FROM A

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:11.808
LOT OF BLOOD PRESSURE AND THE

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:13.376
FATE OF THE PURPLE BOX HERE.

FIVE GOALS- BUT WE KNOW WE NEED

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:21.217
TO CONTINUE DOING MORE IN THE

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:22.385
EQUITY. THE BLACK CHARGE. A

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.120

YOU CAN BE DOING IN A LONG TERM

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:30.994
BASICALLY DOING REALLY PLAYS A

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.428
FACTOR CREATING ACCESS FOR

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:33.997
INFRASTRUCTURE AND VEHICLE

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.698
PURCHASES SO WE CAN START

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:36.666
GETTING PEOPLE TO THERE MUST BE

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:38.468
A CULTURE TODAY I FEEL LIKE

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:39.869
EVERY PURCHASE THAT NOT OF THEIR

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:43.606
VEHICLE ON THE ROAD TEN FIFTEEN

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:45.742
TWENTY YEARS- SO WE WANT TO TALK

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.543
TO ALL OF THAT BUT LET ME STOP

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:48.745
YOU THERE YESTERDAY YOU HEARD

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:50.513
THE PRESIDENT SAY. THAT WE'VE

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.481
GOTTEN AN INFLATION PROBLEM AND

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:52.715
EVERYBODY WHO'S LISTENING TO

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:55.451
THIS AND IT'S NOT LISTENING TO

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:56.719
US NO STAT AND ONE THIRD OF THE

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:59.455
INFLATION IS. IS DETERMINED BY

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:02.225
THE VALUE OF CARS IN THE INSANE

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:04.761
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:07.363
USED CARS WE'RE IN THE WORST

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.899
POSSIBLE TIME TO ENCOURAGE POOR

01:01:09.966 --> 01:01:12.301
PEOPLE OR FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:14.337
PEOPLE TO GET INTO ABOUT TO

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:16.406
PURCHASE A- USED CAR BECAUSE

01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:18.508
IT'S AT THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:20.877
PRICE IT COULD BE. MY THREE AND

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.612
A HALF YEAR OLD SUBARU IS WORTH

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:24.747
MORE TODAY THAN IT WAS. IN

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:26.516
AUGUST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN I

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:28.351
BOUGHT IT THEN YOU'VE GOT A

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:34.323
PROGRAM DESIGNED TO GET A LOT OF. UNSOPHISTICATED ACTUALLY-

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.458
FINANCIALLY INSECURE PEOPLE TO

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:39.896
GO BY ZIPS NOT EXAMS RIGHT NOW

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:42.331
AT THE AT THE HIGH POINT FURTHER

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:45.401
FUELING INFLATION IN CALIFORNIA

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:48.471
HOW COULD THAT BE A STRATEGY I

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:49.872
MEAN I GUESS IT MAY BE A GOOD

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:52.875
STRATEGY BUT JUNE AND WE VOTED

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:53.976
FOR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION BUT NOW

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:55.978
CARBON IS ASKING FOR MORE MONEY

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:58.114
ON THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL TWO

01:01:58.181 --> 01:01:59.148
HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION YOU

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:01.084

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:03.219
POSSIBLE TIME. WITH IT WITH

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:04.687
INFLATION WE DO HAVE SOME

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:06.856
ECONOMIC CANNOT HEAR WHY WOULD

WOULD YOU NOT. CHILL OUT ON THIS

01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:14.097
UNTIL THE PRICE OF USED CARS

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:15.932
CAME DOWN IN THE PRICE OF USED

01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:18.835
CARS IT TOOK. A INSULT TO INJURY

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.703
THE CARD HAS NOW CHANGED THE CVR

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.705
PETE SO THE WHOLE BATCH OF

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:24.006
MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE ARE NOT

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:26.275
ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. HOW

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:28.144

THIS IS THE SINGLE LARGEST.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.349
COMPONENT THAT FUELS INFLATION

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:08.037
EARLY. TO HELP MAKE THE

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:09.872
TRANSITION HAPPENED AND IT

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:11.707
REALLY IS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY I

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:13.609
MEAN I HAVE TO TELL YOU THERE'S

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:16.379
A REASON WHY A LOT OF ANTI.

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:17.546
GLOBAL ARE MAKING A SELECTION

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:19.615
VEHICLES ARE OFTEN CHEAPER TO

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:22.051
OPERATE LESS MAINTENANCE. LOWER

01:05:22.118 --> 01:05:23.586
FUEL COSTS WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:25.421
THAT IT'S A GOOD FOR OUR

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:27.523
BUSINESS IN THE CALIFORNIA. GOOD

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:28.691
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.293
GOOD FOR ECONOMIC OR

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:32.528
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. EITHER

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:36.432
VEHICLE THAT. GENERALLY RUN ON

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:37.833
PEOPLE. REALLY POLLUTING WE KNOW

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.769
WE TO GET THE UPPER. THEY AHEAD

01:05:39.835 --> 01:05:41.837
OF TIME AND IT DOES TIME TO

01:05:41.904 --> 01:05:43.272
BUILD UP. THAT THERE COULD BE

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:44.573
ANYWHERE FROM. NINE MONTHS TO

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.007
YOUR PROJECT GET THE

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:46.942
INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT. SO WE NEED

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:48.411
TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS TODAY.

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:51.747
AND WE HAVE THE PROGRAMS ARE

01:05:51.814 --> 01:05:52.415
OVERSUBSCRIBED. KEEP HELPING THE

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:53.816
POOR THESE BUSINESSES THAT WANT

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:55.685
TO DO THAT. PROBABLY IN THE

01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:57.586
MEETING THAT YOU HAVE THE

01:05:57.653 --> 01:05:58.821
DESPAIR BUT ALSO VERY TARGETED

01:05:58.888 --> 01:05:59.955
IN PLACE OF LIKE FRIENDS ABOUT

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:01.791
THE- ALTHOUGH IF YOU USE THE

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:03.926
TRANSIT THAT THEM. AND ALSO PORT

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:05.127
EQUIPMENT BURGER YOU HAVE BEEN

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:06.495
WHILE. THAT WE THOUGHT WAS

01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:10.066
REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:10.666
MAKING INVESTMENTS THERE. TO

01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:12.568
BUILD ON THAT. I MEAN WHEN I

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.570
THINK AND WE'VE ALL SEEN THE

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:15.738
PICTURES. JUST ROWS AND ROWS OF

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.273
COMBUSTION TRUCKS COME IN AND

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.208
OUT OF AIRPORTS. WE'VE SEEN YOU

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:20.743
KNOW THE GRAY SKIES IN THE IN

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.845
THE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHO'S

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.113
SEEN THE MAPS OF ACCELERATED

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.581
CANCER RISK. AND ACCOUNT

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:27.116
DECLINING AIR QUALITY IMPORTANT

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:28.884
FREE COMMUNITIES. THIS IS JUST A

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:32.355
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AREA AS A

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:37.793
MATTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ALSO.

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:42.698
ALSO. WE'RE HANGING ON THAT WORD

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:52.408
IT'S ALSO. WELL I GUESS THE

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:55.745
QUESTION IS MR IDEA ARE YOU CAN

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:58.080
INVEST IN FIXED RAIL FROM OUR

01:06:58.147 --> 01:07:01.217
PORTS TO MOVE CARGO TO THE

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:03.219
INLAND EMPIRE THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:06.288
AND HAVE ZERO EMISSIONS WHY TWO

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:08.824
THIRDS OF THIS INVESTMENT GOING

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:11.594
IN TO. HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.929
CREATING WORSE IS NEAR ZERO

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:15.264
EMISSIONS YOU KNOW WHAT I AM

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:17.566
TRYING TO CREATE THAT TO FOCUS

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:19.802
IN ON THE NEAR TERM WE CAN DO

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.004
THINGS FOR. NEAR TERM EMISSIONS

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:25.040
FOR. BIO FUELS TO BE MIXED WITH

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:26.475
WITH DIESEL THAT WOULD REDUCE

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.644
EMISSIONS IN THE SHORT TERM AND

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:30.713
IMPROVE AIR QUALITY. TOMORROW

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.281
BUT WE'RE GOING FOR THE SHINY

01:07:32.348 --> 01:07:35.584
PENNY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHY

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:37.386
THESE CHOICES. WE'RE DOING OUR

01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:38.954
PART OF FINANCE I GET A LITTLE

01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:40.523
BIT IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:42.291
HIGHER AMOUNT YOU THAT WE HAVE

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:44.193
ON THE HEAVY DUTY PRIDE THOUGH.

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.861
I THINK NEAR KNOWLEDGE AT THIS

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:47.863
SEGMENT IS IT A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:49.532
LESS MATURE SEGMENT THAT DON'T

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:50.633
NEED ADDITIONAL OR AT THIS

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:53.035
STAGE- AND BIG KNOWLEDGE THIS

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:54.970
SEGMENT IS ONE THAT CAUSES

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:59.041
SIGNIFICANT LOCAL AIR POLLUTION

01:07:59.108 --> 01:07:59.475
AND NEGATIVE HEALTH

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:01.010
CONSEQUENCES. EARLY FOR LOW

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:02.144
INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:03.245
COMMUNITIES. ABELARD INVESTMENT

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:05.614
AND THE HEAVY DUTY- AND KIND OF

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:08.684
OPERATE. NOW WE CAN CAN DRIVE

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:11.687
ECONOMIC OF SCALE L. BROUGHT IN.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:14.557
MY CHANGE- KIND OF WORK FOR

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:15.991
COMMON COMPONENTS. TO ENSURE

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:17.960
THAT IN THE LONG TERM. WE DO

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:19.061
HAVE A MORE EQUITABLE

01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:21.130
TRANSITION- TO THE REMISSION

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:22.865
TECHNOLOGY ENSURE THAT WE DO

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.868
HAVE THE- NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.804
WHO- KIND OF. ALIGNED WITH THE

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:31.006
REGULATIONS THAT WERE BEATING IT

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.441
AND- ACTUALLY INVESTMENT IN THAT

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:34.543
AREA NOW. WE THINK COULD HELP

01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:36.645
BUT MORE IN THE LONG TERM GIVEN

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:37.847
THAT THIS IS OUT OF THE-

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:40.149
VARIOUS. SEGMENTS ONE OF THE-

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:41.851
LESS MATURE SEGMENT.

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:44.253
INTERMISSION VEHICLE. SO HOW ARE

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.821
YOU GOOD AT HOW DOES THAT

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:47.389
ADDRESS OUR CONGESTION PROBLEMS

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:48.858
HENRY I GIVE NO WE'VE BEEN IN A

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:50.559
PANDEMIC FOR TWO YEARS AND

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:52.094
PEOPLE. ARE IN A HAPPY PLACE

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:53.596
BECAUSE THERE'S- A LOT OF FOLKS

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.431
ARE PEOPLE WORKING REMOTELY BUT

01:08:55.498 --> 01:08:57.533
WE HAVE. A CONGESTION PROBLEM

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.568
AND IF ALL YOU'RE DOING IS

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:01.136
TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF BUSES

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.271
BECAUSE YOU'RE DURING COURAGE

01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:04.507
THEM TO BUY. ZERO EMISSION

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.575
VEHICLES WITH REBATES AND

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:08.544
INCENTIVES AND TAKE THE TRUCK'S

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:10.179
NOT REPLACE ANY TRUCKS BUT MAKE

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:11.847
THEM ZERO MISSION. ARE YOU JUST

01:09:11.914 --> 01:09:14.917
CREATING CLEAN CONGESTION I MEAN

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:15.851
IF YOU'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE

01:09:15.918 --> 01:09:18.020
CONGESTION. YOU'RE SAYING- WE

01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:20.322
WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAN. DON'T YOU

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.157
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BOTH OF

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:23.959
THEM WITH US AND THE GOVERNMENT

01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:25.160
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. TO BOTH

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:27.429
OF THEM AND COME UP WITH SOME

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.999
INCREMENTS OF ELECTRIC TRAINERS

01:09:30.065 --> 01:09:32.268
SOME WAY TO MOVE CARGO OUT THE

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:34.270
PORCH. BEFORE IN THE

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:41.010
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. BUT

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:41.710
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE. BUT I

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:44.046
SEE. IF YOUR LONG TERM BENEFIT

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:46.348
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT TWENTY

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:47.616
FORTY FIVE IF YOU LOOK AT TWENTY

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:49.952
FORTY FIVE YOUR YOUR BIG BAD IS

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.687
THAT WE WANT TO. WE WANT TO.

DUTY TRUCK IS ZERO EMISSION NOT

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:58.594
NEAR TERM BUT NEAR ZERO ZERO AND

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:00.362
WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY

01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:01.597
INVESTMENTS INTO FIX RAIL. TO

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:07.036
MOVE THEM. YEAH I THINK THE ONE

01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:09.738
THING I KNOW IS THAT WE DO HAVE

WITH A HEAVY DUTY PEACEFUL

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:20.876
COMPLEXITY TO IT SOUNDS AND

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.011
STRAGGLERS COVERED SOME OF THAT

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:23.712
STUFF. JUST TO RE EMPHASISE THIS

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:25.114

ONLY ARE THESE THESE TRUCKS

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:30.819
DRIVING BOTH CLEAN AIR AND

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:32.588
CLIMATE FAILURES AND TOXIC RISK.

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:34.556
THEY'RE ALSO AT THIS FASCINATING

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:36.091
COST MOMENT IN WHICH BIG

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:38.527
INVESTMENTS ARE BEGINNING TO GO

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:40.729
INTO THAT SPACE FOR THE PRIVATE

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:41.830
SECTOR. AND IT IS OUR CHANCE I

01:11:41.897 --> 01:11:42.865
REALLY THINK TO FOCUS

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:44.600
INVESTMENTS IN A LONG TERM AND

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:46.669
STRUCTURED WAY GIVEN. THE SPEED

AND PACE THAT FLEETS TURNOVER

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:50.472
AND THE NEED FOR CONTINUED

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:52.041
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS WITH

CERTAINTY. TO REALLY DRIVE

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:58.180
INVESTMENTS. THERE SO FROM MY-

OUT OF BOX. THE ADVANCED

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:00.749
TECHNOLOGY WE NEED TO COUNTER

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:02.618
CLIMATE CHANGE IN A BIG AND

01:12:02.685 --> 01:12:03.786
IMPORTANT WAY. AND THEY HELP US

NEEDS WE NEED AND BY INVESTING

01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:08.724
IN MARCH NOW. THERE IS A CHANCE

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:09.925
TO REALLY SUPPORT THAT

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.427
TRANSITION AT A MOMENT WHEN IT

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:12.828
REALLY MATTERS. I'M ON LIGHT

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.997
DUTY AS I KNOW THAT'S AN AREA OF

SUPPORTING THIS PROGRESS. AND

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:57.666
ANOTHER THING I GUESS I'D SAY.

01:13:57.733 --> 01:13:59.635
THAT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:00.769
OVERALL PACKAGE INCLUDING

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:01.703
INVESTMENT STOCK EXTEND THIS TO

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.338
LOWER INCOME FOLKS I THINK

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:04.606
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. WE ARE

01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:05.741
SEEING COST ON THESE VEHICLES.

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:07.142
I'M DOWN WE'RE SEEING HUGE

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:09.178
INVESTMENTS AS THE PRESIDENT

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:09.812
OBSERVED LAST NIGHT INSTEAD OF

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:11.680
THE UNION. BILLIONS AND BILLIONS

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:13.749

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:15.150
REALLY DELAYS BEING MADE TO

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:16.852
SOUND I HAVE TO SAY. THERE'S

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:18.554
REALLY STRONG DEMAND HERE NOT

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.022
ONLY IS THE MARKET EXPANDING IN

01:14:20.088 --> 01:14:22.024
CALIFORNIA AGGRESSIVELY. WERE

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:23.792
SEEN BEING PRIVATE COMPANIES

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:24.927
EVENT HERE SIMPLY BECAUSE

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.461
THEY'RE BETTER VEHICLES THEY

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:27.596
LAST LONGER. THEY'RE CHEAPER TO

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:29.731
RUN. AND THEY FIND IT MORE FUN

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:31.099
TO DRIVE SO THIS EXCITEMENT

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:32.634
HERE. AND A LARGE PART OF THE

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:34.069
CONVERSATION NOW I THINK IT'S

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.671
CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE IN THE

TWO WHICH WILL IMPLEMENT THAT

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.785
REGULATORY DRIVER. AND THEN

BEEN OVERLOOKED IN WHERE WE

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.376

ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:23.592
JUST THE ECONOMIC CITY WE COULD

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:26.928
DO THREE TIMES AS MUCH IN THE-

01:19:26.995 --> 01:19:29.764
GETTING BAD POLLUTING FARM

01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:32.367
EQUIPMENT OFF THE OFF THE- OUT

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:35.971
OF THE SYSTEM. OR KARL MOYER

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:39.007
SOME SMALL GENERATORS THEN THIS

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:42.110
FANCY SPREADSHEET PROGRAM. DID

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:45.780
YOU GUYS TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT

01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:48.083
- YEAH I THINK WE DEFINITELY DID

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.784
AND I AND I'LL JUST KIND OF KNOW

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.153
THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:52.754
THAT WHILE WE DON'T SEE ALL THE

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:54.356
PROGRAMS LISTED HERE- FOR

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:55.724
EXAMPLE FARMERS ALREADY FIND

01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:57.592
ARMOR GOT RID GOT MULTI YEAR

01:19:57.659 --> 01:19:58.860
FUNDING IN LAST YEAR'S PROPOSAL

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:00.829
I THOUGHT. OTHER PROGRAM EVEN

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:01.763
THOUGH WE DON'T EVEN LOOK AT

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:03.999
THAT PART OF THEIR MISSION

01:20:04.065 --> 01:20:04.599
VEHICLE PACKAGE DOESN'T MEAN

01:20:04.666 --> 01:20:05.800
THEY'RE NOT ALREADY IN THE

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:07.736
BUDGET. NO NO I REMEMBER LAST

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:09.704
YEAR I WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:11.239
THE BUDGET AND OVER THREE YEARS

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:13.008
WHAT I'M ASKING IS YOU GUYS ARE

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:15.210
DOUBLING DOWN ON SOME PROGRAMS.

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:16.578
AND YOU'RE SAYING WE'VE GOT TO

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:19.347
GO WIN BECAUSE IT'S WE'VE HAD

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:20.749
SOME SURE RATS WHATEVER YOU DID

01:20:20.815 --> 01:20:23.051
AND WE WON YES I'M SAYING THAT'S

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:25.487
NOT. DEFECTIVE WHY NOT THAT WHY

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:27.122
NOT COMING WITH MORE MONEY ON

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:29.291
THIS PROGRAM THIS IS A POPULAR

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:34.062
PROGRAM THIS REDUCES. OUR CARBON

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:35.864
IN THE SHORT TERM. I THOUGHT

01:20:35.931 --> 01:20:37.566
THAT EXPRESS. NOTHING IN THERE

01:20:37.632 --> 01:20:39.734
IF YOU GO WHAT EIGHTY THOUSAND

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:42.170
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THIRTY

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:42.837
THREE GESTURES AND WE KNOW

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:45.006
METHANE IS KILLING US. ABOARD

01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:46.575
YOU HAVEN'T COME UP WITH ANY

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:48.443
PROGRAMS ANY AGGRESSIVE PROGRAMS

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:52.380
NOT SIX POINT ONE BILLION. YOU

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:53.815
KNOW ONE THING I WIL SPEAK TO

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:55.717
ANYONE I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:56.251
MINISTRATIONS ALLOCATION

01:20:56.318 --> 01:20:57.619
DECISIONS THAT'S A DEPARTMENT OF

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:59.621
FINANCE BUT I WILL SAY THAT

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.122
SYSTEM CHANGE. REALLY IS

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:02.090
CRITICAL HERE SORT OF THINK

01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:04.292
ABOUT THE METRICS THAT INFORM

01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:05.093
OUR PROGRAMS THEY'RE MORE THAN

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.629
JUST STRAIGHT COST EFFECTIVENESS

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:08.597
NOW PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY QUITE

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:09.998
COST EFFECTIVE. BUT THESE ARE

01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:11.666
ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT LONG TERM

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:13.068
STRUCTURAL CHANGE SO IT'S

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:13.568
SPECIAL ANYTHING BUT THE

01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:15.170
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WE'VE

01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:17.405
INVESTED AS A STATE BILLIONS AND

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:18.473
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.975
TO CONSTRUCT A SYSTEM THAT IS

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:22.377
DEEPLY INEQUITABLE EXPOSES FOLKS

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:23.311
TO AND RESOLVE NOT SEVERE

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:24.946
POLLUTION. BUILDING OUT OF THAT

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:27.015
DOES TAKE TIME BUT OVER THE LONG

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:28.984
HAUL THAT IS A BIG AND IMPORTANT

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.452
CHANGE IT'S NOT JUST COMMUNITIES

01:21:30.518 --> 01:21:32.354
CALLING FOR IT IT'S THE VISION

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.555
THAT CALLOUSED AND OTHERS HAVE

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:35.490
EXPRESSED I THINK LARGELY.

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:37.425
BECAUSE OF THAT IN THE LONG TERM

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:39.060
HEALTH MOVE US AWAY FROM HAVING

01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:40.695
TO BUY EVERYONE SINGLE FAMILY OR

01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:42.130
SINGLE PASSENGER CARS IT'S A

01:21:42.197 --> 01:21:43.765
BROADER VISION BUT HELP SHIFT

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:45.033
THE SYSTEM STATE. SO JUST

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.768
MULTIPLE METRICS WE NEED TO

01:21:46.835 --> 01:21:47.736
CONSIDER ALL OF THESE FRONTS

01:21:47.802 --> 01:21:49.571
THAT I THINK ARE QUITE IMPORTANT

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.373
TO THINKING ABOUT OUR NEXT YEAR.

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:52.574
WOULD YOU CUT YOU WE'VE GONE

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:54.809
THROUGH COVERT NOBODY'S ON THE

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.511
BUSES NOBODY'S ON THE FIXED RAIL

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:57.746
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP WITH A

01:21:57.812 --> 01:22:00.115
PROGRAM THAT WOULD SUBSIDIZE THE

01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:01.883
A BUS PASS OR TRANSIT PASS IN

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:03.652
SACRAMENTO PEOPLE PAYING SEVEN

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:05.520
BUCKS A DAY TO RIDE THE BUS IN

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:06.855
SACRAMENTO TO SOME LOW INCOME

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:09.324
PEOPLE AND- GOVERNMENT WORKERS.

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.825
COME UP WITH A PROGRAM TO TREAT

01:22:10.892 --> 01:22:13.295
AT THAT INSTANT INCENTIVIZE THEM

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:15.764
OR- GALVANIZE THEM TO RETURN TO

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:17.832
THE BUS MAYBE ONE OR TWO DOLLAR

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:19.701
TO A FLAT RATE AND SOMETHING

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:22.337
THAT YOU SAY THANK YOU MIDDLE

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:22.904
CLASS PEOPLE GIVE PEOPLE THE

01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:24.773
DRIVE TESLAS TO GO BACK AND USE

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.341
TRANSIT. EVEN THINKING ABOUT

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:27.842
THAT I THINK THERE IS A METRIC

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:29.611
OF POT YOU KNOW IT REALLY GREAT

01:22:29.678 --> 01:22:30.712
COUNTRIES ARE ONES WHERE THE

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:32.580
WEALTHY RIDE TRANSIT AND I AGREE

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:34.215
IT IS WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:35.784
THOUGH BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIG

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:37.752
COMPONENTS OF CLEAN CARS FOR ALL

01:22:37.819 --> 01:22:38.320
OUR MOBILITY OPTIONS THAT

01:22:38.386 --> 01:22:38.953
ACTUALLY INCLUDES THINGS LIKE

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.189
TRANSIT PASSES- IN ADDITION TO

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:42.023
CERTAIN ADMINISTRATION LARGER

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:43.391
VISION OF TRANSPORTATION SO

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:44.693
THERE'S NO NEED. IN THESE

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:46.161
PROGRAMS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:47.329
COMPONENTS AND WE'RE QUITE

01:22:47.395 --> 01:22:48.763
EXCITED ABOUT THAT ALONG WITH

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:51.333
SOME OF THE REGULATORY WORK

01:22:51.399 --> 01:22:57.706
WE'RE DOING AND HELPING TO ELECT. OR SCIENCE OR SLEEVES WE LOOK

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:59.908
FOUR TO SEVENTY. ON THAT FOR A-

01:22:59.974 --> 01:23:00.809
ALLEY- HIS PRODDED IT SAYS CAN'T

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.677
USE NEW PROGRAM. AND WE NOT

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:03.978
SEEING DETAILS ON THEM- I'VE

01:23:04.045 --> 01:23:05.580
SAID ENOUGH. CENTER WOW. I DON'T

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:07.482
KNOW WHAT I JUST WITNESSED BUT

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:08.850
THAT WAS AWESOME SOMEBODY IS

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:11.086
ACTUALLY ASKING FOR SOME DETAIL

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:14.289
MEN ASKING FOR A LONG TIME. SO I

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:16.157
WANT TO THANK- THE PRESENTERS-

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:18.493
SO WE HAVE THE QUESTION I HAVE

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.894
IS THAT LOOK WE'RE WE'RE

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:24.132
SPENDING GENERAL FUND DOLLARS.

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:26.000
COUPLED WITH LAST YEAR'S IS THAT

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:27.702
INVESTMENT WE'RE GONNA SPEND TEN

01:23:27.769 --> 01:23:29.938
BILLION THAT DOES THE PROPOSAL

01:23:30.004 --> 01:23:30.939
IS TEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:34.309
NEXT SIX YEARS. AND IT'S OUT OF

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:37.112
SEVERAL POTS- BUT DO YOU KNOW

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:40.014
THE GOVERNOR CAME UP WITH. BY

01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:41.549
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WE'RE GONNA

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:44.552
HAVE. NO CELL. OF COMBUSTIBLE

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:49.124
ENGINE VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:50.792
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE PLAN

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:54.062

WANT I WANTED MAYBE SPRING BOARD

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.031
OFF OF WHAT THE SENATOR WHITE

01:23:57.098 --> 01:23:58.900
HOUSE H WAS TALKING ABOUT

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.034
THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTMENT IN

01:24:00.101 --> 01:24:01.102
CALIFORNIA RIGHT IN THE

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:02.737
TECHNOLOGY SECTOR BECAUSE WERE

01:24:02.804 --> 01:24:05.006
POPPING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:06.975
GRANTS FOR PEOPLE TO DO THAT

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:09.077
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS TRYING TO GET

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:11.546
US TO AS MY COLLEAGUE QUOTED THE

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:13.515
SHINY PENNY AT TWENTY FORTY FIVE

THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW IS

01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:24.058
THIS BUDGET. GOING TO GET US. TO

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:24.993
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NO

01:24:25.059 --> 01:24:27.729
COMBUSTIBLE ENGINES SALES OF

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:29.798
VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S

01:24:29.864 --> 01:24:36.171
THE FIRST QUESTION. YEAH I CAN

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:38.840
SPEAK TO THEM FOR SOCCER SIDE-

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:40.708
THAT YOU MENTIONED SO WE HAVE

01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:42.143
ROBUST TOOLS AND PLANTS THE

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:43.845
PLANTS THAT ARE GOOD FOR HER

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.213
COMPONENT MANY OF WHICH HAVE

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.714
BEEN GIVEN TO US BY THE

01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:48.149
LEGISLATURE SO WE LOOK AT THINGS

01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:50.018
LIKE ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE

01:24:50.084 --> 01:24:51.686

WIDE. OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:54.689
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.791
THE NUMBER OF DEATHS WE PROJECT

01:24:56.858 --> 01:24:58.393
FOR TWENTY THIRTY BEYOND- WE

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.762
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT A. B. TWENTY

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:01.863

ANYTHING LIKE OUR OTHER PROGRAMS

01:25:58.753 --> 01:26:00.321
THAT WILL ALSO BE

01:26:00.388 --> 01:26:00.855
OVERSUBSCRIBED. THE MONEY

CENTER JUST TO BUILD ON THE

01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:13.001
SUNDAY. SIDE AS THIS RESULTS

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:13.635
NOTED RECORDING REALLY CLOSELY

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.003
AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT BILL

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:17.005
THAT'S HAPPENING IN A REALLY

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:18.106
THOUGHTFUL WAY MISS BOTH. PUBLIC

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:19.974
FUNDS. AND INCREASING THE AMOUNT

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:21.543
OF PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDS FOLKSY

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:23.177
THE OPPORTUNITY HERE I MEAN.

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:24.746
IT'S A PRETTY HARD TIME SEO IS

01:26:24.812 --> 01:26:26.014
WITH THE AUTO COMPANIES AND

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.815
INFRASTRUCTURE FIRMS POURING

01:26:27.882 --> 01:26:28.583
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THIS

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:30.084
DIRECTION THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH

01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:31.619
THEY RECOGNIZE THIS IS WHERE THE

WORLD IS GOING TO WANT TO GET

01:26:33.555 --> 01:26:35.623
AHEAD OF IT. I THINK SOME OF OUR

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:36.758
TASK THE CARD. IS MAKING SURE WE

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:38.526
HAVE BOTH THE REGULATORY AND

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:40.194
INCENTIVE SCAFFOLDING TO HELP US

GET IT. THERE SEEN A LOT OF

01:26:41.796 --> 01:26:42.830
THESE OPPORTUNITIES AT ONCE SO

01:26:42.897 --> 01:26:44.566
THAT MEANS BOTH CREATING REALLY

01:26:44.632 --> 01:26:46.267
CLEAR REGULATORY DIRECTION AND

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:47.702
BOTH THE LIGHT AND HEAVY DUTY

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:49.604
SIDE TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT PICK

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:51.673
UP. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:53.308
ARE REALLY THINKING ABOUT THINGS

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:54.342
LIKE DURABILITY AND USED

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:55.843
VEHICLES. MAKING SURE ALL THESE

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:56.578
MARKETS WORK. AND ON THE

01:26:56.644 --> 01:26:58.413
INCENTIVE SIDE. REALLY TRYING TO

01:26:58.479 --> 01:26:59.681
MAKE SURE WE'RE FOCUSING AND

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:00.648
TARGETING THOSE PUBLIC DOLLARS

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.517
AND SMART WAYS WHICH IS WHY WE

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:03.718
FOCUS SO HEAVILY ON EQUITY AND

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:05.053
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND THINKING

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:06.888
THROUGH HOW THIS WORKS FOR THE

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:08.356
MANY LIKE UT SECTORS. AND OF

01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:10.091
COURSE ARE ALWAYS VERY OPEN TO

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:11.693
DIRECTION WAYS TO DO THAT BETTER

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:13.661

WANT TO TALK ABOUT

01:27:18.766 --> 01:27:20.201
INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M NOT TALKING

01:27:20.268 --> 01:27:21.836
ABOUT THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.871

ADVANCE WE HAVE IT AND THAT THIS

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:51.799
IS THE ELECTRIC GENERATION SIDE

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:52.900
OF OUR STATE. NOBODY'S TALKING

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:55.269
ABOUT THAT. SIXTY TWO THOUSAND

01:27:55.336 --> 01:27:57.372
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS LAST YEAR.

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:59.807
WERE WE DIDN'T GENERATE POWER

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:06.514
IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:07.915
WE'RE GONNA HAVE ELECTRIC GRID

01:28:07.982 --> 01:28:10.218
SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE TO PUT

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:12.220
ALL THESE. VEHICLES IN

01:28:12.286 --> 01:28:16.391

SHUT DOWN. THREE THOUSAND

01:28:25.099 --> 01:28:27.969
MEGAWATTS AT DIABLO CANYON. AND

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:29.070
YOU'RE GOING TO HOW YOU CAN

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:30.872

BUSINESS. AND CARB UNDER AB

01:28:39.847 --> 01:28:40.782
THIRTY TWO FORCED ME TO HAVE TO

01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:42.817
CHANGE THE TECHNOLOGY IN MY

01:28:42.884 --> 01:28:44.786
TRUCKS AND IT COST ME A HECK OF

01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:47.588
A LOT OF MONEY AND BY THE WAY

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:48.856
THE TECHNOLOGY DIDN'T WORK. THE

01:28:48.923 --> 01:28:51.359
TRUCKS BROKE DOWN CAUGHT ON FIRE

01:28:51.426 --> 01:28:53.528

TO GET THERE BY TWENTY THREE BY

01:28:57.799 --> 01:28:59.367
THERE'S NO DETAIL IN HERE OF HOW

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:00.835
THE PLAN GOES AND HOW WE'RE-

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:03.905
GONNA REDUCE CARBON. CALIFORNIA

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:07.108
ADMITS 1% OF THE WORLD'S CARBON

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:09.343
. I'M GONNA PIVOT NOW BECAUSE

01:29:12.747 --> 01:29:14.382
QUESTION HOW'S THAT GENERATING

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:15.750
ELECTRICITY CALIFORNIA GONNA

01:29:15.817 --> 01:29:17.051
COME IF YOU'RE GONNA SHUT DOWN

01:29:17.118 --> 01:29:18.720
DIABLO CANYON AND IT'S BEEN A

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:20.555
FEW YEARS. AND WHERE'S ALL THIS

01:29:20.621 --> 01:29:22.690
ENERGY GONNA COME FROM. HOW'S IT

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:23.791
GOING TO HAPPEN HOW WE GONNA

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:26.260
CHARGE THESE CARS AND PUT IN

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:27.128
THESE FIVE THOUSAND DC FAST

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:30.698
CHARGERS. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:32.500
QUESTION IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:33.968
ONE I'M ACTUALLY VERY GLAD YOU

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:36.804
ASKED THAT. SO I WANT TO START

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:38.106
BY NOTING THAT DIDN'T LIKE PS

01:29:38.172 --> 01:29:39.741
YEAH THANK. YOU YOU ARE A

01:29:39.807 --> 01:29:41.909
FUNCTION OF. WHAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:29:41.976 --> 01:29:43.745
DONE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE RIGHT.

01:29:43.811 --> 01:29:45.313
WILDFIRES AND DROUGHT ENDED THE

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:48.316
INACTION. OF NOT DEALING WITH.

01:29:48.382 --> 01:29:49.650
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:51.085
LOCAL AIR POLLUTION. I THINK

01:29:51.152 --> 01:29:52.019
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT HAVE

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:53.654
BANDAID SOLUTION TO REALLY

01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:59.260
CONNECT. TO THE REMOTE COMPUTER.

01:29:59.327 --> 01:30:00.027
LET ME ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:01.629
ABOUT REGRET IN. RESILIENCY AND

01:30:01.696 --> 01:30:02.697
LIVE ARE TO OUR MISSION. AND

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:03.731
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PROACTIVE

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:05.733
WORK IN THIS SPACE- I THINK

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.368
FRANKLY WE COULD D A BETTER JOB

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:09.103
OF EDUCATING FOLKS OF ALL WE ARE

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:11.339
DOING IN THE STATE HAS ADVANCED

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:11.939
ELECTRIC THE COMPLAINING

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:14.375
CONSTANTLY. DEMAND FORECASTING

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:16.811
CAPABILITIES. ACROSS ALL

01:30:16.878 --> 01:30:17.879
SEGMENTS HEATING ELECTRIC

01:30:17.945 --> 01:30:20.348
VEHICLE. AND WE- WE HAVE MULTI

01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:22.083
AGENCY COLLABORATION OF ENERGY

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:24.152
COMMISSION AND- THE NETWORK OUT.

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:25.186
THE TYPE OF TRANSMISSION

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:27.221
PLANNING PROCESS. THE BEAUTY

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:29.357
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING.

01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:30.558
AND WE CONTINUE TO ADD MORE

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:33.361
CAPACITY TO THE GRID. WE CANNOT

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:34.495
LET THE GRAND BE A BARRIER TO

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:36.497
OUR ADOPTION. WE'VE GOT A TWO

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:38.099
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF THE

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:38.733
STATIONERY STORES IN THE LAST

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.601
YEAR ALONE. AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:45.606
ADD EVEN MORE ENERGY. FOR A COPY

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:47.909
CAN GENERATION. SO AS WE LOOK AT

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:49.744
UP GRIP ALL THE NEED TO BE CROSS

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:51.746
ABOUT IT ACROSS. EIGHTY P. AND

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:54.115
UTILITIES WE ALSO LOOK AT THE

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:55.383
LOAD THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:57.285
COLLECTOR VEHICLES AS WELL. WE

01:30:57.351 --> 01:30:59.053
HAVE TO MAKE THE BY TWENTY

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.722
THIRTY WILL HAVE BETWEEN 12221%

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:03.791
NEW LOW COMPARED TO TODAY. AND

01:31:03.858 --> 01:31:05.660
THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO CREATE A

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:07.195
NEW SYSTEM WIDE PEAK I THINK

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:08.663
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THE

01:31:08.729 --> 01:31:10.531
INVESTMENT WE NEED TO BE MAKING

01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:11.999
OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL FOR

01:31:12.066 --> 01:31:14.068
DISTRIBUTION P. WE'RE PLANNING

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:16.671
POLITICALLY BOTH THE- MODEL. AND

01:31:16.737 --> 01:31:18.573
THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH WELL.

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:21.108
BUT I DO WANT TO KNOW MORE LIKE

01:31:21.175 --> 01:31:22.543
A VEHICLE OR QUITE REMARKABLE.

01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:24.512
THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE ON SITE

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:26.547
RESILIENCY IN A WAY THAT I GOTTA

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:27.949
FEEL COOL COULD NEVER GET THIS

01:31:28.015 --> 01:31:29.517
IS NOT SOME FAR FETCHED THING

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:30.718
WE'RE GONNA DO IN THE FUTURE

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:33.287
THIS IS- WHAT THE FORD F. ONE

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:34.589
FIFTY LIGHTING. WILL BE ABLE TO

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:35.857
DO IT RECALLED LAUGHTER I THINK

01:31:35.923 --> 01:31:39.093
YOU HAVE ONE ORDER- I DO TOO SO

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.728
WE ALL HAVE THAT ONE RELATIVELY

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:42.363
SOON. AND THEN THAT'S NOT THE

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:44.165
ONLY VEHICLE DOING IT YOU KNOW

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:45.933
JUST A BIT DEEPER BALL THERE WAS

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.401
A CUTE BABY SEX. SHOULD BUY TO

01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:48.803
REPLICATE THE BUILDING AS WELL

01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:51.305
EITHER WE'RE PLANNING FOR TODAY

01:31:51.372 --> 01:32:01.148
THE TECHNOLOGY HERE. WE DID NOT

01:32:01.215 --> 01:32:02.817
HAVE THE WILL TO CONNECT ABOUT.

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:04.452
S. DRIVER PART OF MY BILL THING

01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:06.420
ALL JUST KNOW IS AGENDA I NUMBER

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:07.955
THREE ACTUALLY ON THE- GREEN

01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:08.923
ENERGY IN. AT THE BUILDING IT IS

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:10.558
BENEFITS WHICH I THINK WILL BE A

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:12.593
TO DO IT OUT THERE AND DETAIL.

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:13.794
THE NECK AGENDA. WHICH I THINK

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:15.529
PARTIALLY GET YOUR QUESTION ON

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:17.098
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:32:17.164 --> 01:32:18.499
DOING. IN TERMS OF THAT KIND OF

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:19.867
BROADER ENERGY PORTFOLIO. AND

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:21.502
THAT THEY'LL BE THE NEXT DAY

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:23.070
THAT. WELL OKAY I'M CONCERNED

01:32:23.137 --> 01:32:25.740
THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:27.808
POWER AND I THIS IS A HECK OF A

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:29.644
LOT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE JUST

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:30.978
HANDING OVER AND THERE'S NO

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:32.680
DETAILS IS BASICALLY YOU KNOW

01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:34.582
YOU'RE SAYING GIVE US THE MONEY

01:32:34.649 --> 01:32:35.750
AND WE'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW

01:32:35.816 --> 01:32:37.018
WE'RE GONNA SPEND IT OR WHAT

01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:38.986
WE'RE BUYING LATER AND THAT'S

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:39.987
NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME WHEN WE'RE

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:43.190
PAYING. IN A RANGE FROM. THREE

01:32:43.257 --> 01:32:45.693
HUNDRED FIFTY TO A THOUSAND TO

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.994
SIX TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:49.463
TIME. TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:51.465
IN THESE PROGRAMS WE'VE SEEN

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:54.702
THAT WITH THE- WITH THAT PUT THE

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:57.171
BULLET TRAIN. THE ACTUAL

01:32:57.238 --> 01:32:59.307
REDUCTION IN CARBON THAT THAT'S

01:32:59.373 --> 01:33:01.542
GOING TO PROVIDE IS WHEN WE CAN

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:02.910
GET INTO AN ESTIMATE OF THE

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:05.046
THOUSANDS PART TIME IF IT EVEN

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:07.982
DOES IT. SO FOR ME IT'S LIKE WE

01:33:08.049 --> 01:33:10.418
NEED A LOT MORE. DETAIL ON HOW

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:11.852
WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE AND I

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:13.754
THINK THE PUBLIC IS STARTING TO

01:33:13.821 --> 01:33:15.222
DEMAND IT BECAUSE- LET'S TALK

01:33:15.289 --> 01:33:16.857
ABOUT THE PORTS IN THE DRY

01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:19.160
TRUCKS FOR A- FOR A MOMENT. LAST

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:20.828
NIGHT I WAS MAYBE TWO WEEKS AGO

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:21.929
WE HAD THE PORT AUTHORITY PERSON

01:33:21.996 --> 01:33:23.464
THERE'S ONE THERE'S ONE VEHICLE

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:26.000
AVAILABLE AND WE I ASKED ABOUT

01:33:26.067 --> 01:33:27.101
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GONNA HAVE

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:28.436
TO COME INTO THE PORTS. AND ALL

01:33:28.502 --> 01:33:30.438
I HEARD WAS ABOUT WE REALLY GOT

01:33:30.504 --> 01:33:31.806
TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE AIR

01:33:31.872 --> 01:33:33.641
QUALITY PROBLEMS FOR. OUR PORTS.

01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:36.043
SO I DID SOME RESEARCH. THE

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.978
REASON WE HAVE AIR QUALITY

01:33:37.044 --> 01:33:38.980
PROBLEMS IN IN THE PORTS IS

01:33:39.046 --> 01:33:41.415
BECAUSE WE HAVE. SUPER TANKERS

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:42.650
SITTING OUT THERE IDOLING

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:44.418
WAITING TO UNLOAD OIL COMING

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:47.355
FROM ECUADOR. SAUDI ARABIA AND

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:48.589
OTHER COUNTRIES BECAUSE WE'RE

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:50.992
NOT A BIT WE DON'T HAVE THE BILL

01:33:51.058 --> 01:33:53.094
WHICH HAVE NO. NO REGULATIONS

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.929
LIKE WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. SO

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:56.063
THEY'RE SITTING OUT EARLY IF IT

01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:57.798
DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU. CHANGE

01:33:57.865 --> 01:33:59.533
THE PORT AT ALL IT'S THE SHIPS

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.135
THAT ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING. THE

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:03.037
POLLUTION THAT IS POLLUTING SAN

01:34:03.104 --> 01:34:06.240
DIEGO THERE WAS AN NBC STORY

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:07.575
ABOUT IT. BUT WE DON'T TALK

01:34:07.641 --> 01:34:09.610
ABOUT THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT

01:34:09.677 --> 01:34:13.814
HOW WE COULD PRODUCE. CLEAN FUEL

01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:16.384
GASOLINE OUT OF CALIFORNIA AND I

01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:18.452
ASKED LAST WEEK ABOUT THIS SIX

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:19.920
HUNDRED WELLS VETERAN PERMITTING

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:20.888
PROCESS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:22.556
PERMITTED BECAUSE ADMINISTRATION

01:34:22.623 --> 01:34:23.891
HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET THE JOB

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:26.894
DONE FOR THESE OIL PRODUCERS IN

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:27.962
CALIFORNIA WHICH THEY PRODUCE

01:34:28.029 --> 01:34:29.897
THE MOST. CLEAN ENERGY IN THE

01:34:29.964 --> 01:34:32.767
WORLD. AND WE'RE WE'RE WATCHING.

01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:36.203
NOW ECUADOR SENDING. 27% OF OUR

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:37.872
OIL IN HERE AND THEY'RE

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:39.707
DESTROYING THE RAINFOREST SO HOW

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:43.978
CAN CALIFORNIANS FEEL GOOD ABOUT

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:45.946
. ALL THESE PROGRAMS WE TALK

01:34:46.013 --> 01:34:46.881
ABOUT IT WE'RE GONNA LEAD THE

01:34:46.947 --> 01:34:48.983
WORLD IN CLEAN TECHNOLOGY BUT WE

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:50.551
DON'T USE OUR OWN TECHNOLOGY

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:52.620
HERE WORK FOR FORCING US TO

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:54.688
BRING OILS. AND OTHER PRODUCTS

01:34:54.755 --> 01:34:56.624
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IN AND

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:59.493
THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM. TO ME

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.529
IS A IS THIS A PROCTOR SEE THE

01:35:01.595 --> 01:35:02.797
THINK THAT. WE'RE GOING TO LEAD

01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:04.498
THE WORLD BUT WE DON'T TELLTHE

01:35:04.565 --> 01:35:06.734
TRUTH THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS

01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:07.835
WHERE EXPERT BRINGING EXPORTS IN

01:35:07.902 --> 01:35:09.637
HERE AND WE'RE NOT DEVELOPING

01:35:09.703 --> 01:35:10.604
OUR OWN RESOURCES IN A CLEAN.

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:11.906
AND EFFICIENT MANNER AND

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:13.007
ACTUALLY GETTING TALIB

01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:16.377
CALIFORNIA'S TAX BASE AND JOBS

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:19.613
HERE. SO FOR SO- SOMEHOW

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.916
SOMEBODY HAS TO. EXPLAIN TO ME

01:35:21.982 --> 01:35:23.884
HOW WE'RE GONNA DRIVE THE COST

01:35:23.951 --> 01:35:24.785
ON THE LAST THING I'LL POINT OUT

01:35:24.852 --> 01:35:27.521
WHICH I POINT OUT EVERY SINGLE

01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:28.756
TIME. IS WE TALK ABOUT WILDFIRE

01:35:28.823 --> 01:35:29.857
. WE DON'T COUNT CARBON FROM

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:33.694
WILDFIRE. WHICH IS THE IT WHICH

01:35:33.761 --> 01:35:35.529
WE NEED TO BE SPENDING WE NEED

01:35:35.596 --> 01:35:37.465
TO SPEND ABOUT TEN BILLION

01:35:37.531 --> 01:35:38.132
DOLLARS ON WILDFIRE IS THAT A

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.800
TEN BILLION DOLLARS ON. GETTING

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:43.104
PEOPLE IN EV'S. BECAUSE WE'RE

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:45.606
BURNING DOWN OUR OUR IT- FORCED

01:35:45.673 --> 01:35:46.740
A MILLION ACRES BURNED IN MY

01:35:46.807 --> 01:35:48.742
DISTRICT LAST YEAR AND WE'RE NOT

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:50.511
SPENDING THE RESOURCES WE NEED

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:51.846
TO SPEND THERE AND IT DEVASTATES

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:53.180
A WILDLIFE THE WATERSHEDS THAT

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:55.516
ALL CALIFORNIANS NEED AND IT'S A

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:58.853
PLACE WHERE WE SEQUESTER CARBON

01:35:58.919 --> 01:36:00.921
. SO WE NEED A LOT MORE DETAIL

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:02.590
WHERE THIS MONEY'S GOING WE NEED

01:36:02.656 --> 01:36:03.958
TO BE DOING THIS IN A COMMON

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:05.593
SENSE APPROACH WE NEED TO TAKE

01:36:05.659 --> 01:36:08.295
CARE OF A WILDFIRE SO WE DON'T

01:36:08.362 --> 01:36:10.197
HAVE THE P. S. P. S. IS THAT

01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:11.432
WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST. WE NEED A

01:36:11.499 --> 01:36:12.867
SICK MAKE OUR- OUR WATERSHEDS

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:13.734
HEALTHY. AND THAT'S WHERE WE

01:36:13.801 --> 01:36:15.836
SHOULD BE FOCUSING THE MONEY AND

01:36:15.903 --> 01:36:16.971
IT'S THE CHEAPEST PLACE WE CAN

01:36:17.037 --> 01:36:19.507
REDUCE CARBON. EXCELLENT AND I

01:36:19.573 --> 01:36:21.375
HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION ON THE

01:36:21.442 --> 01:36:22.476
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PACKAGE

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:25.212
THAT'S- BEFORE US ON THE-

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:27.381
BETWEEN THE AIRPORT AND THE C.

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:29.917
E. C. HOW ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.952
ADMINISTER THE FEDERAL FUNDS.

01:36:32.019 --> 01:36:34.555
THAT ARE COMING THE THREE

01:36:34.622 --> 01:36:35.856
HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE HOW DOES

01:36:35.923 --> 01:36:37.725
THAT. SOUND ON THE CHARGING

01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:38.359
INFRASTRUCTURES CODE TO CARVE

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:40.594
DIFFICULT THAT THAT AND

01:36:40.661 --> 01:36:42.363
OBVIOUSLY HOW. YOU GUYS TOUCHED

01:36:42.429 --> 01:36:44.832
ON THE KAUFMAN I REMEMBER IN THE

01:36:44.899 --> 01:36:46.567
FALL THE AIRPORT WAS GOING

01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:48.936
THROUGH SOME REGULATIONS. YES

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:51.572
SOME REGULATIONS ON THE ACTUAL

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:53.841
MACHINES AND THEY WERE DEBATING

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:55.609
WHETHER THEY WOULD SWIPE YOUR

01:36:55.676 --> 01:36:56.844
CREDIT CARD OR YOU HAVE

01:36:56.911 --> 01:36:58.379
TOUCHLESS. THERE'S A QUITE A

01:36:58.445 --> 01:37:00.948
ACRIMONY THAT HOW DID THAT. END

01:37:01.015 --> 01:37:02.950
UP BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE ARE

01:37:03.017 --> 01:37:05.252
CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO HAVE. THE

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:08.923
CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY- AND IT

01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:13.661
SEEMS SILLY TO ME BUT. MAYBE

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:15.362
MISTER SIEGEL HOW YOU COULD. IN

01:37:15.429 --> 01:37:16.964
ME SURE- SINISTER SPEAKING

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:19.099
FEDERAL FUNDS AS ACTS WITH YOUR

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:20.601
CARD ASKED TO THE AXIS

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:22.002
REGULATION THAT COMES FROM A

01:37:22.069 --> 01:37:24.271
STATUTE THE LEGISLATURE ASKED US

01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:25.573
TO INSURE OPEN ACCESS TO

01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:27.341
CHARGING THAT WE SEE REALLY

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:28.209
IMPORTANT- WE HAD SOME

01:37:28.275 --> 01:37:30.611
COMPANIES- SUGGESTS THAT. SOME

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:32.279
ASPECTS OF THAT REGULATION THAT

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:33.814
ENSURE FOLKS WITH CHIP CARDS IS

01:37:33.881 --> 01:37:35.649
NOT EVERYONE IS A TAP CARD I'M

01:37:35.716 --> 01:37:37.351
IN CHARGE- WILL BECOMING

01:37:37.418 --> 01:37:39.820
OUTDATED. WE DID A COMPREHENSIVE

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:40.988
SURVEY AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS IS

01:37:41.055 --> 01:37:42.389
NOW OUT OF THE DRAFT REPORT

01:37:42.456 --> 01:37:44.558
WHICH BASICALLY SHOWS THAT

01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:45.726
ALTHOUGH THOSE TAP CARDS ARE

01:37:45.793 --> 01:37:47.061
BECOMING MORE PREVALENT. THERE'S

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:48.729
STILL A LOT OF FOLKS WHO DON'T

01:37:48.796 --> 01:37:49.663
HAVE THEM THAT WILL BE REPORTING

01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:51.732
TO THE BOARD AND THAT WE CAN

01:37:51.799 --> 01:37:53.801
COMMENT ON THE DRAFT I BELIEVE

01:37:53.867 --> 01:37:54.902
RIGHT NOW- LATER. IN THE SPRING

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:56.570
AND THEN THE BOARD CAN CHOOSE

01:37:56.637 --> 01:37:57.838
WHERE IT WANTS TO GO FROM THERE.

01:37:57.905 --> 01:37:59.907
I UNDERSTAND FROM THE BANKS THAT

01:37:59.974 --> 01:38:01.775
ANYBODY CAN GET A CARD WHEN I

01:38:01.842 --> 01:38:03.744
WAS SENT WHEN I WAS A COP TWENTY

01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:05.980

GOAL OF 40% GREENHOUSE GAS

01:39:26.994 --> 01:39:29.830
REDUCTIONS BY NINETEEN NINETY BY

01:39:29.897 --> 01:39:31.999
TWENTY THIRTY- BETTER BELOW

01:39:32.066 --> 01:39:32.966
NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY

01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:35.703
THIRTY- A COUPLE YEARS AGO SO

01:39:35.769 --> 01:39:37.905
WELL OVER A DECADE IN ADVANCE SO

01:39:37.971 --> 01:39:39.506
I THINK THESE ARE THINGS TO BE

01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:41.308
PROUD OF. ON THE OTHER HAND THE

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:42.076
PROPOSAL BEFORE YOUR REFLECTS

01:39:42.142 --> 01:39:46.146
THE MASSIVE. AMOUNT OF WORK

01:39:46.213 --> 01:39:48.248
STILL LEFT TO BE DONE. THE SCALE

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:49.783
OF THE SHELL AND THEN. IN JUST

01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:50.818
ABOUT THIS WHEN YEAR WE

01:39:50.884 --> 01:39:52.419
PUBLISHED THE SB ONE HUNDRED

01:39:52.486 --> 01:39:53.687
FOUR AND IT MADE A COUPLE OF

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:55.522
REALLY KEY FINDINGS FIRST BUT I

01:39:55.589 --> 01:39:58.726
KNOW IT IS A 100% CLEAN EIGHT A

01:39:58.792 --> 01:40:00.728
1100% CLEAN GRID BY TWENTY FORTY

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:02.730
FIVE IS ACHIEVABLE SH BUT WE'LL

01:40:02.796 --> 01:40:04.298
NEED TO APPROXIMATELY TRIPLE OUR

01:40:04.365 --> 01:40:05.499
ELECTRICITY GENERATION FROM

01:40:05.566 --> 01:40:07.735
SOLAR AND WIND. AND WILL NEED TO

01:40:07.801 --> 01:40:10.070
INCREASE BATTERY STORAGE RATES

01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:11.638
BY MUCH MORE THAN THAT. SO THIS

01:40:11.705 --> 01:40:13.107
PACKAGE BEFORE YOU PROPOSE TO

01:40:13.173 --> 01:40:15.042
INVEST TO BUILD TWO BILLION

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.909
DOLLARS ACROSS SEVERAL

01:40:15.976 --> 01:40:17.444
DEPARTMENTS AND PROGRAMS A FEW

01:40:17.511 --> 01:40:19.613
OF. WHICH YOU'LL HEAR FROM US A

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:20.981
LITTLE BIT LATER THIS MORNING

01:40:21.048 --> 01:40:22.583
WE- ARE THE ENERGY COMMISSION

01:40:22.649 --> 01:40:23.817
WOULD MANAGE A TOTAL OF

01:40:23.884 --> 01:40:26.086
APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT SEVEN

01:40:26.153 --> 01:40:28.021
FIVE BILLION OF THAT. RESIDENTS

01:40:28.088 --> 01:40:29.723
DESIGN TO DO A FEW THINGS FIRST

01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:31.558
MAINTAIN A LASER FOCUS ON THE

01:40:31.625 --> 01:40:32.459
LIABILITY I APPRECIATE THE

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:33.560
COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE

01:40:33.627 --> 01:40:35.629
LAST PANEL. ABOUT THE NEEDTO BE

01:40:35.696 --> 01:40:36.764
VIGILANT ABOUT RELIABILITY

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:38.932
THAT'S JOB NUMBER ONE. SECOND

01:40:38.999 --> 01:40:40.734
SPUR PRIVATE INVESTMENT CAN

01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:42.770
GENERATE JOBS. BUT WE ALSO WANT

01:40:42.836 --> 01:40:44.071
TO LEVERAGE LEVERAGE SOME OF THE

01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:45.506
FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:46.807
COMING TO CALIFORNIA OR COULD BE

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:48.609
IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL ITH THE

01:40:48.675 --> 01:40:50.210
COMPETITIVE GRANTS. AND WE WANT

01:40:50.277 --> 01:40:51.578
TO PROMOTE EQUITY ACROSS

01:40:51.645 --> 01:40:53.614
CALIFORNIA INCLUDING IN TRIBAL

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.215
LOW INCOME AND UNDERREPRESENTED

01:40:55.282 --> 01:40:58.185
COMMUNITIES. THIS PROGRAM- THIS

01:40:58.252 --> 01:41:00.020
THIS PACKAGE WAS DEVELOPED WITH

01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:02.156
A NUMBER OF OTHER AGENCIES. AND

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:04.358
WE THINK IT REPRESENTS REALLY

01:41:04.425 --> 01:41:05.459
STRONG BOTH SHORT TERM

01:41:05.526 --> 01:41:07.094
INVESTMENTS THE POINTS THAT WERE

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:08.562
MADE EARLIER THERE'S A NEED

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:10.097
RIGHT NOW TO START REDUCING

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:11.331
POLLUTION AND ADDRESSING THESE

01:41:11.398 --> 01:41:14.168
ISSUES AND THEN. ALSO THE LONGER

01:41:14.234 --> 01:41:17.337
TERM. THE PUBLIC THAT THE PRIOR-

01:41:17.404 --> 01:41:19.206
HANDLED LOOK AT TRANSPORTATION

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:21.141
DECARBONIZATION I'M GONNA TALK

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:23.177
TO YOU BRIEFLY- TODAY ABOUT HOW

01:41:23.243 --> 01:41:25.446
WE'VE WE POCKETED THE PROPOSED

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:26.547
INVESTMENTS IN THREE AREAS

01:41:26.613 --> 01:41:28.348
PURCHASE OR CHRISSY GENERATION

01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:30.884
CARBONIZATION. THE SECOND IS

01:41:30.951 --> 01:41:32.886
BUILDING THE CARBONIZATION AND

01:41:32.953 --> 01:41:34.655
THE THIRD IS INDUSTRIAL

01:41:34.721 --> 01:41:36.957
ORGANIZATION. YEAH LOTS TO COVER

01:41:37.024 --> 01:41:37.858
SOME OF MOVE REALLY QUICKLY

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:41.261
FIRST. PROPOSING FOR ELEMENTS OF

01:41:41.328 --> 01:41:42.262
ELECTRICITY SYSTEM THE

01:41:42.329 --> 01:41:44.198
CARBONIZATION I'LL TAKE THOSE

01:41:44.264 --> 01:41:46.266
BRIEFLY WONDERED THE FIRST. LONG

01:41:46.333 --> 01:41:49.102
DURATION ENERGY STORAGE AND WERE

01:41:49.169 --> 01:41:49.970
SEEKING TREATMENT EIGHTY MILLION

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:55.008
DOLLARS. THIS IS. REALLY KEY TO

01:41:55.075 --> 01:41:57.244
OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. IT WILL

01:41:57.311 --> 01:41:57.845
HELP US ENSURE RELY RESILIENT

01:41:57.911 --> 01:41:59.513
LECTURER WHEN THE NUMBERS ARE

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:00.414
NOT AVAILABLE- CENTER DOLLY SHE

01:42:00.481 --> 01:42:01.949
POINTED OUT WELL WHEN THE GRID

01:42:02.015 --> 01:42:04.585
IS DOWN FOR FURTHER RESEARCH.

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:06.053
THREE PRIMARY DRIVERS FOR THIS

01:42:06.119 --> 01:42:07.888
PROPOSAL THE FIRST AS WE HAVE

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:10.324
DONE REALLY WELL WITH- LITHIUM

01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:13.660
TECHNOLOGY EVERYBODY OWNS THE

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:16.263
SHOP ONE OR MORE. OUR NEXT HOUR

01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:17.965
BY LITHIUM. BUT IT IS NOT

01:42:18.031 --> 01:42:20.934
PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED FOR THE

01:42:21.001 --> 01:42:24.838
GRID SCALE- STORAGE THAT WE NEED

01:42:24.905 --> 01:42:26.640
TO MOVE INTO THE FUTURE SO WE

01:42:26.707 --> 01:42:28.275
WANT TO INVEST IN A

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:30.811
DIVERSIFICATION. PROGRAM AND

01:42:30.878 --> 01:42:31.912
WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT OTHER

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:32.880
TECHNOLOGIES OTHER CHEMISTRIES

01:42:32.946 --> 01:42:34.748
LIKE SAY IRON FLOW BATTERIES

01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:35.816
MECHANICAL STORAGE LIKE

01:42:35.883 --> 01:42:37.484
COMPRESSED AIR AND FLY WHEELS

01:42:37.551 --> 01:42:40.053
ANDTHERMAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT'S

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:42.256
ONE REASON BEHIND SECOND IS. TO

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:43.457
HELP COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE

01:42:43.524 --> 01:42:45.025
GRID OUTAGES AGAIN CENTERED ALL

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:47.027
YOU KNOW TO THIS EARLIER-

01:42:47.094 --> 01:42:48.562
THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER PS PS A

01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:50.597
MENTION OF THE PAST TWO SUMMERS.

01:42:50.664 --> 01:42:52.099
BY THE OUTAGES SOME OF WHICH

01:42:52.165 --> 01:42:54.501
HAVE EXCEEDED FOUR HOURS AND

01:42:54.568 --> 01:42:55.769
FOUR HOURS IS GENERALLY THE

01:42:55.836 --> 01:42:58.238
BENCHMARK OF WHERE LITHIUM WORKS

01:42:58.305 --> 01:42:59.806
VERY EFFECTIVELY BEYOND THAT

01:42:59.873 --> 01:43:01.708
IT'S NOT THE BEST CHEMISTRY THAT

01:43:01.775 --> 01:43:03.744
WE ARE AWARE OF. TODAY SO WE

01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:05.913
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE FOCUS ON

01:43:05.979 --> 01:43:07.981
THAT AND GET- STORAGE THAT LASTS

01:43:08.048 --> 01:43:09.950
LONGER AND THEN FINALLY A GREAT

01:43:10.017 --> 01:43:12.185
SUPPORT THE ISSUE IN A REPORT

01:43:12.252 --> 01:43:13.387
INDICATES WE NEED TENS OF

01:43:13.453 --> 01:43:14.688
THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF

01:43:14.755 --> 01:43:16.189
ADDITIONAL STORAGE BY TWENTY

01:43:16.256 --> 01:43:17.891
FORTY FIVE. AND WE GOT TO BRING

01:43:17.958 --> 01:43:19.760
THE COST DOWN TO GET THE

01:43:19.826 --> 01:43:20.694
PERFORMANCE BETTER IN THESE

01:43:20.761 --> 01:43:22.029
TECHNOLOGIES AND THAT'S WHAT

01:43:22.095 --> 01:43:22.596
THIS INVESTMENT WILL DO ARE

01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:23.664
BASICALLY SPELLS OUT THE PLAN

01:43:23.730 --> 01:43:25.532
AND A LOT MORE DETAIL- BUT I'M

01:43:25.599 --> 01:43:26.667
GONNA LEAVE IT AT THAT AND

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:33.206
INVITE QUESTIONS AT. THE END.

01:43:33.273 --> 01:43:33.907
NEXT TO THE GREEN HYDROGEN.

01:43:33.974 --> 01:43:35.576
TREMENDOUS PROM IN HIDE YOUR-

01:43:35.642 --> 01:43:37.244
YOU'VE HEARD OF IT'S IMPACTS

01:43:37.311 --> 01:43:37.811
INCREASE. IT'S ALSO. VERY

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:38.779
HELPFUL AND HARD TO ELECTRIFY

01:43:38.845 --> 01:43:40.113
SECTORS LIKE INDUSTRY THAT

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:42.349
REQUIRES VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES.

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:44.184
AND THEN FINALLY A GREAT SUPPORT

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:46.353
IT I USUALLY CAN COMPLEMENT. OR

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:48.522
REPLACE THE FOSSIL GASBURN THAT

01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:50.724
WE SEE TODAY. AND IT CAN ALSO BE

01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:53.126
USED FOR STORAGE I DIDN'T TO BE

01:43:53.193 --> 01:43:54.995
SHORT FOR A LONG TIME THEN USE

01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:57.164
LATER. HOWEVER WE HAVE A LOT TO

01:43:57.230 --> 01:43:57.798
LEARN ABOUT. IT BECAUSE IT'S

01:43:57.864 --> 01:44:00.701
REALLY A NEWCOMER TO THIS CLEAN

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:02.035
ENERGY SPACE. WHAT WE PROPOSE

01:44:02.102 --> 01:44:04.171
WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A NO REGRETS

01:44:04.237 --> 01:44:05.272
STRATEGIES. THAT'S BECAUSE IF

01:44:05.339 --> 01:44:06.540
YOU'RE GONNA USE HYDROGEN YOU

01:44:06.607 --> 01:44:08.575
GOTTA PRODUCE IT YOU CAN'T PUT A

01:44:08.642 --> 01:44:09.776
WINDOW YOU CAN PUT UP A SOLAR

01:44:09.843 --> 01:44:11.712
PANEL YOU GOTTA PRODUCE IT USING

01:44:11.778 --> 01:44:13.013
ELECTRICITY FROM SOME OTHER

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.648
SOURCE SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:44:14.715 --> 01:44:16.850
THAT THOSE SOURCES ARE GOING.

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:18.919
AND WHAT WE WOULD PROPOSE TO DO

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:22.522
IS USE- BUT LOOK AT A NUMBER OF

01:44:22.589 --> 01:44:25.425
DIFFERENT WAYS. DIFFERENT SKILLS

01:44:25.492 --> 01:44:27.461
THAT WE CAN USE ELECTROLYSIS

01:44:27.527 --> 01:44:29.262
SPLITTING THE HYDROGEN OUT OF H.

01:44:29.329 --> 01:44:32.666
TWO O. WATER TO- SECURE THAT

01:44:32.733 --> 01:44:34.267
HYDROGEN WILL BE USED FOR THE

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:36.236
PURPOSES WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING.

01:44:36.303 --> 01:44:39.973
SO RIGHT NOW ABOUT 95% OF ALL I

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.342
DID IN THIS USED COMES FROM

01:44:42.409 --> 01:44:44.845
FOSSIL FUELS AND WE WANT TO

01:44:44.911 --> 01:44:45.879
REVERSE THAT TREND. WE

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:46.947
APPRECIATE AND NOBODY QUESTIONS

01:44:47.014 --> 01:44:48.081
ON THIS THAT THERE IS FEDERAL

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:49.783
FUNDING FOR THIS AND WE THINK WE

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:52.853
ARE. OBJECTIVELY POSITION TO.

01:44:52.919 --> 01:44:54.054
RECEIVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF THAT

01:44:54.121 --> 01:44:56.657
FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA. AND HAPPY

01:44:56.723 --> 01:44:57.858
TO TALK ABOUT THAT LATER AS

01:44:57.924 --> 01:45:00.293
WELL. NEXT UP THE THIRD OF THE

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.595
FOUR AND ELECTRICITY

01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:03.664
DECARBONISATION IS OSCAR WIN.

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:05.365
CALIFORNIA HAS AN ENORMOUS

01:45:05.432 --> 01:45:06.500
UNTAPPED OPPORTUNITY WITHOUT

01:45:06.566 --> 01:45:08.802
SURE WHEN. IT'S NICE BECAUSE IT

01:45:08.869 --> 01:45:12.839
COMPLEMENTS SOLAR WIND OFTEN

01:45:12.906 --> 01:45:13.640
BLOWS WHEN THE SUN ISN'T

01:45:13.707 --> 01:45:15.375
SHINING. CENTRAL IS THIS VERY

01:45:15.442 --> 01:45:16.410
LARGE COASTAL ECONOMIES CAN

01:45:16.476 --> 01:45:17.944
BENEFIT FROM THIS PARTICULAR UP

01:45:18.011 --> 01:45:19.646
ON THE NORTH COAST AND IN THE

01:45:19.713 --> 01:45:21.515
CENTRAL COAST. AND THIS IS

01:45:21.581 --> 01:45:22.816
CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE

01:45:22.883 --> 01:45:24.484
GOALS THAT- BY THE

01:45:24.551 --> 01:45:25.052
ADMINISTRATION IS LAID OUT-

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:27.154
LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:29.623
THIRTY GIGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE

01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:30.991
WIND BY TWENTY THIRTY NATIONWIDE

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:32.959
. THE SP ONE OTHER REPORT CALLS

01:45:33.026 --> 01:45:33.760
FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:45:33.827 --> 01:45:35.729
OFFSHORE WIND. AND WE WOULD USE

01:45:35.796 --> 01:45:37.664
THIS FUNDING FORTY FIVE MILLION

01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:40.100
FOR EARLY STAGE PLANNING. AND

01:45:40.167 --> 01:45:41.468
FOR SOME INITIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:43.837
THAT WE'RE THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:45:43.904 --> 01:45:46.373
NEED. FINALLY- FIRST SECTOR IS

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.974
ENERGY MODELING THIS IS A

01:45:48.041 --> 01:45:49.509
RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMENTS

01:45:49.576 --> 01:45:50.544
SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS BUT IT'S

01:45:50.610 --> 01:45:52.779
ACTUALLY ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO

01:45:52.846 --> 01:45:54.681
SHIFT OUR CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY.

01:45:54.748 --> 01:45:56.249
SHE SHE LED THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:45:56.316 --> 01:45:57.951
THE SP ONE HUNDRED REPORT AND WE

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:00.587
LOOK IT UP A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

01:46:00.654 --> 01:46:02.756
SCENARIOS. SHOP THE CARD WITH A

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:03.690
CORE SCENARIO THAT COMBINED INTO

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:05.358
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EFFORTS WE

01:46:05.425 --> 01:46:06.760
LOOK AT THIS VERY DIFFERENT

01:46:06.827 --> 01:46:08.995
SCENARIOS WITH DIFFERENT-

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:11.231
COMBINATIONS OF RESOURCES. AND

01:46:11.298 --> 01:46:12.132
MODELING WAS CRITICAL TO THE

01:46:12.199 --> 01:46:14.201
SPOUSES. INVEST BILLIONS OF

01:46:14.267 --> 01:46:15.635
DOLLARS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:46:15.702 --> 01:46:17.237
MAKE A SMALL INVESTMENT IN

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:19.206
MODELING SO THAT WE CAN MAKE

01:46:19.272 --> 01:46:21.208
WISE DECISIONS THROUGHOUT. EACH

01:46:21.274 --> 01:46:22.209
ALL RIGHT NEXT UP IS BUILDING

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:24.911
DECARBONIZATION WE'RE SEEKING

01:46:24.978 --> 01:46:26.313
NINE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION

01:46:26.379 --> 01:46:27.614
DOLLARS FOR BUILDING

01:46:27.681 --> 01:46:28.148
DECARBONIZATION AND WE'RE

01:46:28.215 --> 01:46:29.282
CALLING THE EQUITABLE BUILDING

01:46:29.349 --> 01:46:31.118
THE CAR BECAUSE- THAT'S REALLY

01:46:31.184 --> 01:46:32.886
WHAT OUR FOCUS IS. WE'VE DONE

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:34.654
REALLY REALLY WELL IN CALIFORNIA

01:46:34.721 --> 01:46:36.757
NEW BUILDINGS WE HAVE AMONG THE

01:46:36.823 --> 01:46:39.793
CLEANEST- CLOSEST TO ZERO CARBON

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:43.130
APPROACHING. ZERO CARBON

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:43.930
BUILDINGS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

01:46:43.997 --> 01:46:46.166
BUT HE HAS BEEN BUILDING LEVEL

01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:47.534
OF WORK TO DO. AROUND HALF OF

01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:48.568
ALL BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA WERE

01:46:48.635 --> 01:46:50.971
BUILT BEFORE THE ENERGY

01:46:51.037 --> 01:46:51.872
COMMISSION STARTED IN THE LATE

01:46:51.938 --> 01:46:53.740
NINETEEN SEVENTIES. CREATING

01:46:53.807 --> 01:46:56.042
RULES ABOUT- ABOUT BUILDINGS AND

01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:57.944
HOW THEY CAN BE ENERGY EFFICIENT

01:46:58.011 --> 01:46:59.513
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:46:59.579 --> 01:47:01.448
TARGETING WITH THIS FUNDING IS

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:03.116
AN EXISTING BUILDING STOCK. THE

01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:04.518
PROPOSALS AIMED AT THE MOST

01:47:04.584 --> 01:47:06.286
VULNERABLE AMONG US AND WE'RE

01:47:06.353 --> 01:47:08.255
LOOKING AT DIRECT INSTALLS. IN

01:47:08.321 --> 01:47:09.990
REBATES DIRECT INSTALLS IN

01:47:10.056 --> 01:47:11.591
PARTICULAR WE THINK WILL WORK

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:13.193
WELL IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.795
AND MIDDLE INCOME COMMUNITIES

01:47:14.861 --> 01:47:16.329
AND THE REBATES WOULD BE

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:18.799
TARGETED AT ALL CALIFORNIA

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:21.635
COACH- I THINK I'M GONNA SKIP A

01:47:21.701 --> 01:47:23.904
LITTLE HERE IN MY NOTES TO MOVE

01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:24.938
ALONG BUT AGAIN HAPPY TO ASK

01:47:25.005 --> 01:47:26.807
QUESTIONS OR ANSWER QUESTIONS

01:47:26.873 --> 01:47:29.309
WERE LOOKING TO- DO WORKSHOPS ON

01:47:29.376 --> 01:47:30.911
ALL THESE TOPICS. AND REALLY

01:47:30.977 --> 01:47:32.646
REFINE FOR PRECISION WHAT WE

01:47:32.712 --> 01:47:34.981
WOULD BE- STYLING THE PROGRAM

01:47:35.048 --> 01:47:37.250
STATUS. SO FINALLY I WANTED TO

01:47:37.317 --> 01:47:38.318
TALK ABOUT INDUSTRIAL

01:47:38.385 --> 01:47:39.886
DECARBONISATION WHERE WERE

01:47:39.953 --> 01:47:40.921
SEEKING FUNDING FOR TWO

01:47:40.987 --> 01:47:43.056
PROGRAMS. THE FIRST IS THE FOOD

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:44.658
PRODUCTION INVESTMENT PROGRAM I

01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:45.992
THINK YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THIS

01:47:46.059 --> 01:47:48.829
WE WATCHED IT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:47:48.895 --> 01:47:50.030
WITH FUNDING FROM THE CALIFORNIA

01:47:50.096 --> 01:47:52.599
COMMON INVESTMENT. PROGRAM AND

01:47:52.666 --> 01:47:54.100
IT WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL WE

01:47:54.167 --> 01:47:56.736
RECEIVED A REQUEST FOR FUNDING

01:47:56.803 --> 01:47:58.104
THAT WERE TWICE AS MUCH AS THE

01:47:58.171 --> 01:47:59.906
FUNDING WE HAVE AVAILABLE THERE

01:47:59.973 --> 01:48:00.874
WERE MANY UNSUCCESSFUL

01:48:00.941 --> 01:48:02.943
APPLICANTS. WHO HAD MERITORIOUS

01:48:03.009 --> 01:48:05.445
PROJECTS BUT WE HAD TO PICK THE

01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:06.913
BEST OF THE BEST AND SOME DIDN'T

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:07.948
MAKE IT. SOME OF THESE PROJECTS

01:48:08.014 --> 01:48:10.650
ARE SHOWING 7280% ENERGY SAVINGS

01:48:10.717 --> 01:48:12.152
SO THIS IS BEEN A DEMONSTRABLY

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:13.987
EFFECTIVE PROGRAM ONE THAT WILL

01:48:14.054 --> 01:48:15.722
YIELD IMMEDIATE RESULTS. ARE

01:48:15.789 --> 01:48:17.858
RELATIVELY IMMEDIATE RESULTS

01:48:17.924 --> 01:48:19.759
WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO GET GRASS

01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:22.729
OUT THERE. ABOUT 85% OF THE SITE

01:48:22.796 --> 01:48:24.264
TO THE CURRENT FOOD PRODUCTION

01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:26.233
INVESTMENT PROGRAM CALLED AFTER

01:48:26.299 --> 01:48:28.435
WE'RE IN DISADVANTAGED OR LOW

01:48:28.501 --> 01:48:30.103
INCOME COMMUNITIES AND WE AIM TO

01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:32.772
DO- THE SAME WITH THE- WITH THE

01:48:32.839 --> 01:48:38.945
NEW FUNDING TARGET. THOSE

01:48:39.012 --> 01:48:40.013
COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED. CARBS

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:41.748
ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECT OF PRO

01:48:41.815 --> 01:48:42.983
PLAY THIS ONE VERY HIGH. SO IT

01:48:43.049 --> 01:48:44.985
WAS IT WAS- DEFECTIVE AS A

01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:45.886
MATTER OF GETTING FUNDS OUT

01:48:45.952 --> 01:48:47.721
AREAS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A LOT

01:48:47.787 --> 01:48:49.890
OF- OKAY SO ON THE SORT OF THING

01:48:49.956 --> 01:48:52.492
AND IT WAS EXTREMELY COST

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:55.495
EFFECTIVE AS WELL. FINALLY WE

01:48:55.562 --> 01:48:57.831
ARE SEEKING TO EMULATE THE

01:48:57.898 --> 01:48:59.799
SUCCESS WE'VE HAD WITH THE FOOD

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:00.600
PRODUCER WITH WITH THE WITH THE

01:49:00.667 --> 01:49:03.203
F. TYPE PROGRAM. WITH A BROADER

01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:05.372
INDUSTRIAL THE CARD SO WE WANT

01:49:05.438 --> 01:49:06.773
TO TAKE THE LESSONS WE LEARNED

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.541
FROM THE ACTIVE PROGRAM IN

01:49:08.608 --> 01:49:09.743
APPLIED TO OTHER INDUSTRIES

01:49:09.809 --> 01:49:12.112
CALIFORNIA HAS- IS THE BEST

01:49:12.178 --> 01:49:14.381
STAFF REPORT NOTED. FORTY

01:49:14.447 --> 01:49:15.015
THOUSAND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES

01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:16.783
EMPLOYING ABOUT ONE POINT TWO

01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:19.119
MILLION CALIFORNIA'S. SECOND THE

01:49:19.185 --> 01:49:21.621
SECTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER

01:49:21.688 --> 01:49:23.323
35% OF THE STATE'S FOSSIL GAS

01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:27.394
USE IN MORE THAN 20% OF OUR

01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:28.395
STATE'S CHICHI EMISSIONS. AND

01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:29.896
WE'RE LOOKING AT REALLY THAT THE

01:49:29.963 --> 01:49:33.400
TOP INDUSTRIAL GHG EMITTERS NOT

01:49:33.466 --> 01:49:35.235
INCLUDING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:36.369
WE'RE LOOKING AT- CEMENT

01:49:36.436 --> 01:49:38.571
CHEMICALS GLASS AND THOSE. THOSE

01:49:38.638 --> 01:49:40.607
ARE THE TYPES OF INDUSTRIES-

01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:41.141
WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:49:41.207 --> 01:49:43.143
ELECTRIFICATION. STORED WHERE IT

01:49:43.209 --> 01:49:44.644
MAKES SENSE ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:49:44.711 --> 01:49:46.179
AND A WHOLE SUITE OF TOOLS THAT

01:49:46.246 --> 01:49:49.482
WE THINK WILL. HELP INDUSTRY.

01:49:49.549 --> 01:49:50.717
AGAIN WE'LL BUILD MORE WE

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:53.920
LEARNED ON F. TIPPED AND- BUT

01:49:53.987 --> 01:49:55.322
BUILT SOME OF THOSE THINGS IN

01:49:55.388 --> 01:49:57.090
THE INDUSTRIAL D. KERR PROGRAM

01:49:57.157 --> 01:49:58.825
WHICH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:49:58.892 --> 01:49:59.893
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.429
YOU THIS MORNING AND WE LOOK

01:50:02.495 --> 01:50:03.163
FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS YEAH.

01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:10.270
MR MENON AT THE AIRPORT. I THINK

01:50:10.337 --> 01:50:17.243
THAT. PART WAS GOOD RESTAURANTS

01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:21.915
. DELEO THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN-

01:50:21.982 --> 01:50:24.050
MY MISSING SOMEBODY SCREWED

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:25.218
BEFORE IS OR SOMETHING WITH THE

01:50:25.285 --> 01:50:31.157
AIRPORT ARE YOU. I WAS ON.

01:50:31.224 --> 01:50:32.592
THERE'S I THINK THERE'S SOMEBODY

01:50:32.659 --> 01:50:34.728
FROM THE WATER BOARD THAT GOES

01:50:34.794 --> 01:50:35.829
BEFORE ME AFTER DREW I THINK

01:50:35.895 --> 01:50:40.100
IT'S TEN CRACK. OUR YES HI GOOD

01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:43.036
MORNING CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR-

01:50:43.103 --> 01:50:44.838
WHAT I WONDER AT PRESENT TODAY

01:50:44.904 --> 01:50:46.373
AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:50:46.439 --> 01:50:48.041
PACKAGES AN OVERVIEW OF A

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:50.977
SPECIFIC. ENERGY STORAGE PROJECT

01:50:51.044 --> 01:50:52.712
THAT'S INCLUDED WHICH IS TWO

01:50:52.779 --> 01:50:53.847
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION TO

01:50:53.913 --> 01:50:56.583
RESTORE ON STORAGE OPERATIONS AT

01:50:56.649 --> 01:50:59.686
THE LAKE ORVILLE COMPLEX- THIS

01:50:59.753 --> 01:51:01.621
IS- IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH

01:51:01.688 --> 01:51:02.922
PUMPED STORAGE THIS WOULD BE A

01:51:02.989 --> 01:51:06.026
PROPOSAL TO. TURN A LAKE OR A

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:07.694
BILL INTO A VERY LARGE BATTERY

01:51:07.761 --> 01:51:09.662
TO SUPPORT THE ELECTRIC GRAD WE

01:51:09.729 --> 01:51:11.598
HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO GENERATE

01:51:11.664 --> 01:51:13.500
UP TO NINE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF

01:51:13.566 --> 01:51:15.502
ELECTRICITY OUT OF THE LAKE

01:51:15.568 --> 01:51:17.370
ORVILLE COMPLEX WHICH IS

01:51:17.437 --> 01:51:19.939
BASICALLY A COMPARABLE TO THE

01:51:20.006 --> 01:51:22.242
POWER NEEDED TO PROVIDE- A CITY

01:51:22.308 --> 01:51:23.943
THE SIZE OF SAN FRANCISCO JUST

01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:26.446
TO GIVE ME A SENSE OF THE- THE

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:28.314
SCALE. SO THAT PUMPED STORAGE IS

01:51:28.381 --> 01:51:29.816
A PROCESS THAT IN THIS CASE

01:51:29.883 --> 01:51:33.186
WOULD BE UTILIZED- EXCESS SOLAR

01:51:33.253 --> 01:51:34.821
GENERATION THAT'S AVAILABLE

01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:37.323
DURING THE DAY TO PUMP. WATER

01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:40.393
INTO LAKE LAURA BELL. AND THEN-

01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:42.896
GENERATE POWER OUT A LAKE OR A

01:51:42.962 --> 01:51:44.464
BILL RELEASED OUT WATER DURING

01:51:44.531 --> 01:51:46.533
THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING-

01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:48.234
TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY SO

01:51:48.301 --> 01:51:50.603
REALLY ACT AS A LARGE BATTERY-

01:51:50.670 --> 01:51:52.038
TO TAKE SOLAR ENERGY DURING THE

01:51:52.105 --> 01:51:54.340
DAY AND THEN- RELEASE IT TO

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:56.309
GENERATE ELECTRICITY AT TIMES OF

01:51:56.376 --> 01:51:57.911
THE DAY ONE WHEN POWER IS

01:51:57.977 --> 01:52:01.781
NEEDED. TO SUPPORT THE ELECTRIC

01:52:01.848 --> 01:52:03.016
GRID- ONE OTHER THING THAT MAKES

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:04.818
THIS PROJECT VERY ATTRACTIVE IS

01:52:04.884 --> 01:52:07.287
THAT. MUCH OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:52:07.353 --> 01:52:09.189
IS ALREADY IN PLACE SO THIS

01:52:09.255 --> 01:52:10.757
PROJECT CAN BE DONE AT A

01:52:10.824 --> 01:52:13.426
FRACTION OF THE COST OF THE

01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:14.594
COMPARABLE. ENERGY STORAGE

01:52:14.661 --> 01:52:17.063
PROJECT OF THIS SIZE AND IN A

01:52:17.130 --> 01:52:19.632
TIME OF ABOUT TO CAP THE AMOUNT

01:52:19.699 --> 01:52:21.768
OF TIME IS IT A TYPICAL. A

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:24.737
PROJECT OF THIS AND SO OVERALL

01:52:24.804 --> 01:52:27.340
THIS IS A PROJECT AT ALL- YOU

01:52:27.407 --> 01:52:29.175
KNOW REALLY SUPPORT THE STATE'S

01:52:29.242 --> 01:52:31.544
ELECTRIC GRID- AT A- BETTER.

01:52:31.611 --> 01:52:33.480
CARE COSTS AND ALSO IN A SHORTER

01:52:33.546 --> 01:52:34.848
TIME THAN AND THEN ON THE OTHER

01:52:34.914 --> 01:52:36.916
PROJECTS. AND SO MAYBE AT THIS

01:52:36.983 --> 01:52:38.952
POINT ALTERNATE OVER TO MY

01:52:39.018 --> 01:52:43.123
COLLEAGUE AT THEIR BOARD. AND

01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:45.625
MR- IT'S GIVEN TO COVER THE NEXT

01:52:45.692 --> 01:52:46.893
ELEMENT OF THE PACKAGE AND I'LL

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:48.461
JUST SAID THAT WE WERE PLEASED

01:52:48.528 --> 01:52:49.796
TO SEE THE ADMINISTRATION MOVE

01:52:49.863 --> 01:52:51.431
THAT PROJECT FROM THE DROUGHT

01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:52.899
PACKAGE THROUGH THE CLEAN ENERGY

01:52:52.966 --> 01:52:55.502
INVESTMENT BUT- LET'S HEAR FROM

01:52:55.568 --> 01:52:58.037
THE AIRPORT. YEAH THANKS TED

RESOURCES BOARD'S RESEARCH

01:53:06.846 --> 01:53:10.216
DIVISION- HYDRO FLUOROCARBONS OR

01:53:10.283 --> 01:53:12.452
AGENCIES ARE THE FASTEST GROWING

01:53:12.519 --> 01:53:14.654
GREENHOUSE GASES IN CALIFORNIA

01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:17.023
AND GLOBALLY. THESE AGENCIES ARE

01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:19.058
SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS

01:53:19.125 --> 01:53:19.692
WITH HIGH GLOBAL WARMING

01:53:19.759 --> 01:53:22.428
POTENTIAL. THOUSAND TIMES THAT

01:53:22.495 --> 01:53:24.797
OF CARBON DIOXIDE. AND THEY HAVE

01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:27.100
A DISPROPORTIONATE ADVERSE

01:53:27.167 --> 01:53:29.002
CLIMATE IMPACT IN THE NEAR TERM.

01:53:29.068 --> 01:53:30.737
SO ONE OF THE LARGEST USES OF

01:53:30.803 --> 01:53:35.542
HSCS IS IN REFRIGERATION. AND

01:53:35.608 --> 01:53:36.876
AIR CONDITIONING EQUIPMENT-

01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:37.544
CARBERY EARLY ON NEED TO

01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:39.979
REGULATE THESE GASES AND MANY

01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:41.314
OTHER STATES HAVE FOLLOWED HER

01:53:41.381 --> 01:53:43.716
LEAD IN ADOPTING SIMILAR RULES

01:53:43.783 --> 01:53:45.351
TO MITIGATE THESE POLLUTANTS.

01:53:45.418 --> 01:53:46.953
INCENTIVE FUNDING WILL HELP US

01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:49.022
MEET THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGETS

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:51.224
AND START TO ADDRESS AGENCIES

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:53.359
UNDER CARBON NEUTRALITY- THIS

01:53:53.426 --> 01:53:55.094
PROPOSAL ASKED FOR FORTY MILLION

01:53:55.161 --> 01:53:56.729
DOLLARS IN FUNDING. TO BUILD

01:53:56.796 --> 01:53:58.698
UPON THE ONE MILLION ALLOCATED

01:53:58.765 --> 01:54:00.767
BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE TWENTY

01:54:00.833 --> 01:54:02.702
NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET.

01:54:02.769 --> 01:54:04.237
WHICH WAS FOCUSED FOCUSED ON

01:54:04.304 --> 01:54:06.005
COMMERCIAL REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS

01:54:06.072 --> 01:54:08.208
COMMONLY USED IN SUPERMARKETS

01:54:08.274 --> 01:54:10.743
AND GROCERY STORES. ULTRA LOW

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:12.412
GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL

01:54:12.478 --> 01:54:15.048
TECHNOLOGIES EXIST TODAY HOWEVER

01:54:15.114 --> 01:54:17.350
A HIGHER INCREMENTAL COST AND

01:54:17.417 --> 01:54:18.918
LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THESE

01:54:18.985 --> 01:54:21.854
NEW TECHNOLOGIES. I MERRY

01:54:21.921 --> 01:54:24.023
BARRIERS TO THEIR ADOPTION. THIS

01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:25.124
IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR

01:54:25.191 --> 01:54:26.492
EXISTING STORES BECAUSE IT IS

01:54:26.559 --> 01:54:28.528
VERY EXPENSIVE AND CHALLENGING

01:54:28.595 --> 01:54:30.830
TO TRANSITION TO AN ULTRA LOW

01:54:30.897 --> 01:54:32.732
GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL SYSTEM

01:54:32.799 --> 01:54:34.100
DUE TO INCOMPATIBILITY IS

01:54:34.167 --> 01:54:36.002
BETWEEN THE OLD AND NEW

01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:37.870
TECHNOLOGIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF

01:54:37.937 --> 01:54:39.539
INCENTIVE FUNDS EXISTING STORES

01:54:39.606 --> 01:54:41.608
ARE LIKELY TO EITHER CONTINUE TO

01:54:41.674 --> 01:54:43.710
LOOT USE THEIR LEGACY SYSTEMS.

01:54:43.776 --> 01:54:45.511
OR DO A REFRIGERANT RETROFIT TO-

MIDRANGE GLOBAL WARMING

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:49.916
POTENTIAL REFRIGERANT RATHER

01:54:49.983 --> 01:54:52.785
THAN INSTALLING A NEW SYSTEM. IN

OF THE ART CLIMATE FRIENDLY

01:54:58.057 --> 01:54:59.959
REFRIGERATION TECHNOLOGIES. THAT

01:55:00.026 --> 01:55:01.294
REDUCE THE CLIMATE IMPACT OF

01:55:01.361 --> 01:55:03.162
CONVENTIONAL HFC REFRIGERANTS

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:07.900
BY. 99% THE PROGRAM IS 22%

01:55:07.967 --> 01:55:09.969
OVERSUBSCRIBED AND HAPPY AWARDS

01:55:10.036 --> 01:55:12.839
ONE STORES LOCATED IN LOW INCOME

01:55:12.905 --> 01:55:14.674
AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

01:55:14.741 --> 01:55:16.643
HOWEVER THIS REPRESENTS LESS

01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:18.645
THAN 1% OF ALL SUPERMARKETS IN

01:55:18.711 --> 01:55:20.513
CALIFORNIA AND FINANCIAL

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:21.714
INCENTIVES ARE NEEDED TO HELP

01:55:21.781 --> 01:55:23.683
TRANSITION THOUSANDS OF EXISTING

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:26.452
HFC SYSTEMS IN THE STATE AND

01:55:26.519 --> 01:55:27.954
WOULD BE CRUCIAL IN HELPING

01:55:28.021 --> 01:55:29.522
SMALLER STORES IN DISADVANTAGED

01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:31.624
COMMUNITIES. BESIDES

01:55:31.691 --> 01:55:33.493
SUPERMARKETS WE WOULD CONSIDER

01:55:33.559 --> 01:55:35.128
INCENTIVES FOR OTHER COMMERCIAL

01:55:35.194 --> 01:55:38.064
REFRIGERATION CATEGORIES AS WELL

01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:40.466
AS AIR CONDITIONING EQUIPMENT.

01:55:40.533 --> 01:55:42.068
SO DEPENDING ON THE SELECTED AND

01:55:42.135 --> 01:55:44.103
USES THIS FUNDING CAN REPLACE

01:55:44.170 --> 01:55:46.539
EXISTING HIGH GLOBAL WARMING

01:55:46.606 --> 01:55:48.141
POTENTIAL REFRIGERANT SYSTEMS

01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:50.943
AND ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED TO A

01:55:51.010 --> 01:55:51.911
THOUSAND STORES. BUT MORE

01:55:51.978 --> 01:55:53.046
IMPORTANTLY THIS FUNDING IS

01:55:53.112 --> 01:55:54.213
EXPECTED TO HELP THESE

01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:56.449
TECHNOLOGY TYPES RICHARD CONNER

01:55:56.516 --> 01:55:58.251
IS A SCALE WHICH WILL LEAD TO

01:55:58.318 --> 01:56:00.153
FURTHER MARKET ADOPTION. AND

01:56:00.219 --> 01:56:02.088
THEREFORE GREATER GREENHOUSE GAS

01:56:02.155 --> 01:56:04.590
REDUCTIONS. SO THANK YOU- THAT

01:56:04.657 --> 01:56:05.892
WRAPS UP THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:56:05.958 --> 01:56:07.393
PRESENTATION ON THAT ENERGY

01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:09.629
PACKAGE AND OF COURSE WE WOULD

01:56:09.696 --> 01:56:10.763
ALL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

YOU MR SHEARER- SIMILAR TO THE

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:29.782
PACKAGE WE RELEASED OUR ANALYSIS

01:56:29.849 --> 01:56:31.117
OF THE PROPOSED CLEAN ENERGY

01:56:31.184 --> 01:56:33.853
PACKAGE LAST WEEK AND SO THAT'S

01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:35.888
ALSO POSTED OUR WEBSITE ON YOUR

01:56:35.955 --> 01:56:37.023
AGENDA INCLUDES A LOT OF OUR

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:40.159
COMMENTS SO AGAIN I'M GONNA TRY

01:56:40.226 --> 01:56:40.793
TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE- A FEW

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:42.829
COMMENTS FROM THAT- FROM THAT

01:56:42.895 --> 01:56:44.197
ANALYSIS. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:56:44.263 --> 01:56:46.499
QUESTIONS SO I'M GONNA DIVIDE MY

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:47.800
COMMENTS INTO. TWO DIFFERENT

01:56:47.867 --> 01:56:49.702
PARTS ONE WITH JUST SOME

01:56:49.769 --> 01:56:50.670
OVERARCHING COMMENTS ON THE

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:52.672
PACKAGE AS A WHOLE AND SOME

01:56:52.739 --> 01:56:54.107
CONSIDERATIONS AND THEN I'LL GET

01:56:54.173 --> 01:56:55.375
INTO. A FEW OF OUR SPECIFIC

01:56:55.441 --> 01:56:57.143
COMMENTS OR RECOMMENDATIONS ON A

01:56:57.210 --> 01:56:57.944
FEW SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE

01:56:58.010 --> 01:56:59.445
PROPOSAL SO FIRST. ON THE OVER

01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:01.280
ARCHING COMMENTS- WE THINK THE

01:57:01.347 --> 01:57:03.316
PACKAGE GENERALLY TARGETS A

01:57:03.383 --> 01:57:04.684
REASONABLE SET OF ACTIVITIES TO

01:57:04.751 --> 01:57:06.419
PROMOTE DEEP DECARBONIZATION SO

01:57:06.486 --> 01:57:08.321
IF YOUR GOAL IS KIND OF. LONG

01:57:08.388 --> 01:57:10.156
TERM DEEP DECARBONIZATION A

01:57:10.223 --> 01:57:11.491
PARTICULAR BILL ACTRESS DEGRADED

01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:13.359
AND EVEN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAN

01:57:13.426 --> 01:57:15.528
WE THINK. IN A FUNNY MOOD

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:16.629
SUPPORT KEY AREAS WHERE

01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:17.997
SUBSTANTIAL. PROGRESS COULD HELP

01:57:18.064 --> 01:57:19.732
THE COST OF ACHIEVING THOSE THE

01:57:19.799 --> 01:57:21.868
VERY LONG TERM GOALS AND SO- BUT

01:57:21.934 --> 01:57:23.102
ALSO IN ALL THE OTHER LARGEST

01:57:23.169 --> 01:57:24.637
PIECES OF FUNDING RELATED TO

01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:26.305
BUILDING DECARBONIZATION TARGETS

01:57:26.372 --> 01:57:28.141
ONE OF THE- LARGEST SOURCES OF

01:57:28.207 --> 01:57:28.975
STATEWIDE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:57:29.041 --> 01:57:31.277
EMISSIONS AND WHERE THERE ARE

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:34.781
SIGNIFICANT. CHALLENGES TO KIND

01:57:34.847 --> 01:57:36.749
OF DECARBONISATION. S. KIND OF

01:57:36.816 --> 01:57:37.784
BIG PICTURE COM I THINK IT- WE

01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:39.652
DO OUR- STATE GENERAL RATHER

01:57:39.719 --> 01:57:40.720
THAN RATEPAYER FUNDS ELECTRIC

01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:41.888
REPAIR FUNDS IN PARTICULAR DOES

01:57:41.954 --> 01:57:44.857
HAVE MERIT- AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW

01:57:44.924 --> 01:57:46.325
MANY OF THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY

01:57:46.392 --> 01:57:48.194
PROGRAMS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN

01:57:48.261 --> 01:57:50.830
PAID FOR BY- I'LL YOU RATE-

01:57:50.897 --> 01:57:51.898
THROUGH HIGHER ELECTRICITY

01:57:51.964 --> 01:57:54.967
RATES- AND- YOU KNOW THE COST

01:57:55.034 --> 01:57:56.536
FOR THESE CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS

01:57:56.602 --> 01:57:58.838
ARE ONE. ONE FACTOR ONE OF MANY

01:57:58.905 --> 01:57:59.906
FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTES TO KIND

01:57:59.972 --> 01:58:01.808
OF CALIFORNIA'S RELATIVELY. HIGH

01:58:01.874 --> 01:58:03.643
RETAIL ELECTRICITY RATES AND WE

01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:04.744
THINK THAT THOSE THOSE HIGH

01:58:04.811 --> 01:58:07.180
RATES HAVE A VARIETY OF ADVERSE

01:58:07.246 --> 01:58:07.747
EFFECTS INCLUDING. ON THE

01:58:07.814 --> 01:58:09.382
ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE- DISCOURAGING

01:58:09.449 --> 01:58:11.984
ELECTROCUTION BECAUSE- THE FUEL

01:58:12.051 --> 01:58:14.454
IS IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE- AND

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.456
JUST ON ON THE CANADA. ECONOMIC

01:58:16.522 --> 01:58:18.257
INEQUITY SIDE THOSE ELECTRICITY

01:58:18.324 --> 01:58:20.493
RATES. ARE ARE. KIND OF

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:21.861
REGRESSIVE APPROACH TO RAISING

01:58:21.928 --> 01:58:23.930
REVENUE FOR- FOR THESE TYPES OF

01:58:23.996 --> 01:58:25.231
PROGRAMS FOR KIND OF CLIMATE AND

01:58:25.298 --> 01:58:26.666
CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS AND SO YOU

01:58:26.732 --> 01:58:28.534
THINK. THERE'S A LOT OF MERIT

01:58:28.601 --> 01:58:30.536
AND KIND OF YOU KNOW ALLOCATING

01:58:30.603 --> 01:58:31.137
STATE GENERAL FUNDS FOR THESE

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:33.539
TYPES OF PROGRAMS RATHER THAN

01:58:33.606 --> 01:58:37.577
RELYING ON. ELECTRIC RATEPAYERS

01:58:37.643 --> 01:58:38.878
- I THINK I LOVE. COMMENTS SO

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:40.780
BACK. TO A KIND OF A DISCUSSION

01:58:40.847 --> 01:58:42.682
EARLIER AND SOME OF THE ISSUES

01:58:42.748 --> 01:58:43.883
THAT- THAT SURE WAS RAISING.

01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:45.117
THAT IS REALLY REALLY THIS

01:58:45.184 --> 01:58:46.519
PACKAGE WILL REQUIRE KIND OF

01:58:46.586 --> 01:58:48.154
LEGISLATURE BALANCING LONG TERM

01:58:48.221 --> 01:58:50.356
BENEFITS AGAINST NEAR TERM

01:58:50.423 --> 01:58:52.658
PRIORITIES SO. AGAIN MUCH OF THE

01:58:52.725 --> 01:58:53.493
PROPOSED FUNDING IS FOCUSED ON

01:58:53.559 --> 01:58:55.695
ACTIVITIES INTENDED TO MEET SOME

01:58:55.761 --> 01:58:57.296
OF THESE LONG TERM GOALS- ENERGY

01:58:57.363 --> 01:58:58.664
ISSUE REDUCTION BENEFITS FOR

01:58:58.731 --> 01:59:00.166
SOME OF THE PROGRAMS ARE LIKELY

01:59:00.233 --> 01:59:01.534
TO BE RELATIVELY MODEST OVER THE

01:59:01.601 --> 01:59:03.402
NEXT FEW YEARS AND SO. THE

01:59:03.469 --> 01:59:04.837
LETTER SAID YOU REALLY WILL HAVE

01:59:04.904 --> 01:59:06.772
TO KIND OF BALANCE SOME OF THOSE

01:59:06.839 --> 01:59:07.507
LONG TERM GOALS WITH OTHER

01:59:07.573 --> 01:59:08.875
NEARING MEDIUM TERM PRIORITIES.

01:59:08.941 --> 01:59:10.443
SUCH AS KIND OF. PROGRAMS TO

01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:12.111
MEET THE DONATED TWENTY THIRTY

01:59:12.178 --> 01:59:14.714
GHG GOALS. OTHER ENERGY RELATED

01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:16.482
PROGRAMS OR SENATOR DOLLY WAS-

01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:18.150
KIND OF HIGHLIGHTING. YOU KNOW

01:59:18.217 --> 01:59:19.418
ISSUES AROUND GRID RESILIENCY

01:59:19.485 --> 01:59:21.521
AND RELIABILITY- COULD BE KIND

01:59:21.587 --> 01:59:23.556
OF A MORE OF A NEAR TERM

01:59:23.623 --> 01:59:24.257
PRIORITY- OR JUST OTHER

01:59:24.323 --> 01:59:25.291
STATEWIDE PRIORITIES THE

01:59:25.358 --> 01:59:30.630
LEGISLATURE HAS SOME GOOD USE-

01:59:30.696 --> 01:59:31.964
GENERAL FUND RESOURCES FOR. THE

01:59:32.031 --> 01:59:32.598
FOURTH THANKS. REDUCTION COME I

01:59:32.665 --> 01:59:33.833
WANTED ON AGAIN BECAUSE OF

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.535
RELATES THE AN ISSUE THAT WE

01:59:35.601 --> 01:59:36.636
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WHICH IS-

01:59:36.702 --> 01:59:38.204
THERE IS SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL

01:59:38.271 --> 01:59:39.071
FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR SIMILAR

01:59:39.138 --> 01:59:41.574
ACTIVITIES- SO BILLIONS OF

01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:43.409
DOLLARS NATIONWIDE FOR. THREE

01:59:43.476 --> 01:59:44.977
HUNDRED AND HUBS CARBON CAPTURE

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:46.212
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS

01:59:46.279 --> 01:59:47.547
INDUSTRIAL MISSION DEMONSTRATION

01:59:47.613 --> 01:59:50.082
PROJECTS- IN MANY CASES THERE

01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:52.852
ISN'T DETAILED FEDERAL GUIDANCE

01:59:52.919 --> 01:59:53.786
ABOUT HOW THE FUNDING CAN BE

01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:55.521
USED AND HOW IT WILL BE

01:59:55.588 --> 01:59:57.189
ALLOCATED AND SO- AT THIS POINT

AT THE NET REVENUES AND

02:05:14.874 --> 02:05:16.408
SOMETHING WERE SUPPORTIVE OF

02:05:16.475 --> 02:05:18.544
THIS WELL MOVING FORWARD. FIRST

02:05:18.611 --> 02:05:21.580
I I'M IN FAVOR OF POP STORAGE I

02:05:21.647 --> 02:05:22.915
THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

02:05:22.982 --> 02:05:26.385
TO- REUSE WATER AND WHEN WE'RE

02:05:26.452 --> 02:05:28.821
OVER PRODUCING IT TYPICALLY.

02:05:28.888 --> 02:05:30.689
DURING THE DAY WHEN WE HAVE A

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:32.625
LOT OF SUNSHINE I'M FOR THAT THE

02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:34.560
SECOND THING I WANT TO ASK ABOUT

02:05:34.627 --> 02:05:35.794
THAT AND THIS IS A DETAIL

02:05:35.861 --> 02:05:37.663
PROJECT WE HAVE THE THERMAL ITO-

02:05:37.730 --> 02:05:39.331
WE'RE WE NEED COLD WATER VERSUS.

02:05:39.398 --> 02:05:40.933
WHAT WILL FIRST ALL BAG NEEDS

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.869
WARM WATER FISH DEEP COLD WATER-

02:05:43.936 --> 02:05:45.070
AND SO HOW DOES THAT INTEGRATE

02:05:45.137 --> 02:05:46.572
WITH THEIR MALITO AND HOW THAT

02:05:46.639 --> 02:05:52.878
PROJECT IS GOING TO- INTACT FISH

02:05:52.945 --> 02:05:53.846
- YES SO WHEN BE THE EFFECTS

02:05:53.913 --> 02:05:55.481
OPERATE. THE FIRST AS AS A

02:05:55.547 --> 02:05:57.683
PUMPED STORAGE FACILITY IS THAT.

02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:59.385
WATER DOES WARM UP IN THE

02:05:59.451 --> 02:06:01.887
FAMILY- AFTER BAY AND SO WHAT

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:03.889
WE'RE PROPOSING TO ADD HERE IS

02:06:03.956 --> 02:06:06.225
THAT AT TAPPING INTO THE COLDER

02:06:06.292 --> 02:06:09.328
PORTION. OF LAKE OROVILLE- TO

02:06:09.395 --> 02:06:11.330
OFFSET THAT WARMING EFFECTS THAT

02:06:11.397 --> 02:06:13.399
OCCUR- DURING PUMP STORAGE

02:06:13.465 --> 02:06:15.734
OPERATIONS- AND WE'D BE HAPPY

02:06:15.801 --> 02:06:18.437

WATER TO COME OUT OF THAT

02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:38.557
PROJECT SO- THAT WOULD LOOK FOR

02:06:38.624 --> 02:06:40.125
THAT SO MY NEXT QUESTION WOULD

02:06:40.192 --> 02:06:41.694
BE. NOT ONLY WAS IT THAT POKE

02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:43.729

02:07:00.746 --> 02:07:02.381
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET PERMITTED

02:07:02.448 --> 02:07:03.549
AND IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE TO DO

02:07:03.615 --> 02:07:04.817
WORK IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY MOVE

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:06.986
THEIR COMPANIES. OUTSIDE OF

CALIFORNIA- SHIPPING THEM INTO

02:07:11.924 --> 02:07:13.892
CALIFORNIA- IS THERE EVEN ANY

02:07:13.959 --> 02:07:15.894
STUDIES DONE THAT SHOW THAT SHOW

02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:17.763
HOW MUCH CALIFORNIA'S REGULATORY

02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:19.665
ENVIRONMENT DUE TO- ART TRYING

02:07:19.732 --> 02:07:21.400
TO OFFSET OUR CARBON- THAT

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:23.702
ACTUALLY PUSHES. COMPANIES OUT

02:07:23.769 --> 02:07:25.204
OF CALIFORNIA OR TO OTHER

02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:27.439
NATIONS- AND THEN WE STILL GET

02:07:27.506 --> 02:07:28.907
THE PRODUCTS IN HERE BUT WHAT

02:07:28.974 --> 02:07:32.778
ART- DONE IN A- ENVIRONMENTAL

02:07:32.845 --> 02:07:44.823
FRIENDLY WAY- BOARD. THIS IS THE

02:07:44.890 --> 02:07:47.459
MAN NOT THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:07:47.526 --> 02:07:48.694
FINANCE GOOD MORNING. THE-

02:07:48.761 --> 02:07:49.695
INFORMATION AVAILABLE SO OUR

02:07:49.762 --> 02:07:50.996
COLLEAGUES OVER AT THEIR BORDERS

02:07:51.063 --> 02:07:52.564
AND- I DON'T HAVE THOSE STUDIES

02:07:52.631 --> 02:07:55.134
LOOKING BUT I WILL- COORDINATE

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.568
WITH THEM AND GET BACK TO YOU ON

02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:57.736
THAT QUESTION. I WOULD REALLY

02:07:57.803 --> 02:07:59.471
PERSON I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR. A

02:07:59.538 --> 02:08:01.440
LONG TIME ABOUT. YOU KNOW. IN

02:08:01.507 --> 02:08:04.209
CALIFORNIA WE SAW OVER THE LAST.

02:08:04.276 --> 02:08:06.645
SEVERAL YEARS NOW. COMPANIES

02:08:06.712 --> 02:08:09.048
LEAVING CALIFORNIA. IN DROVES

02:08:09.114 --> 02:08:09.882
AND THAT'S A TAX BASE THAT WE

02:08:09.948 --> 02:08:11.683
NEED HERE. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A

02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:13.986
LOT OF MONEY IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT

02:08:14.053 --> 02:08:15.354
NOW BUT IT'S- MONEY THAT HAS

02:08:15.421 --> 02:08:17.356
BEEN PUMPED IN BY. THE FEDERAL

02:08:17.423 --> 02:08:19.658
GOVERNMENT WHICH IS US. WE WORK

02:08:19.725 --> 02:08:20.559
FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS

02:08:20.626 --> 02:08:22.795
WELL AS OVERSEEING DEBT PILED ON

02:08:22.861 --> 02:08:24.797
TO THE FUTURE GENERATIONS. AND

02:08:24.863 --> 02:08:25.864
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WERE SEEN

02:08:25.931 --> 02:08:27.733
PEOPLE LEAVE CALIFORNIA IN

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:29.902
DROVES- QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE

02:08:29.968 --> 02:08:31.770
IT'S TOUGH TO DO BUSINESS HERE

02:08:31.837 --> 02:08:33.138
AND OUR REGULAR REGULATORY

02:08:33.205 --> 02:08:35.974
ENVIRONMENT. IS REALLY STRICT SO

02:08:36.041 --> 02:08:38.377
I NEED THERE SOMEBODY HAS TO DO

02:08:38.444 --> 02:08:39.878
THE EVALUATION OF ARE WE REALLY

02:08:39.945 --> 02:08:41.180
. ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE

02:08:41.246 --> 02:08:42.881
ENVIRONMENT AND FOR JUST PUSHING

02:08:42.948 --> 02:08:46.185
COMPANIES AND WORK FORCE OUT OF

02:08:46.251 --> 02:08:47.786
CALIFORNIA. TO SUPPLY THOSE

02:08:47.853 --> 02:08:49.588
PRODUCTS BACK INTO CALIFORNIA

02:08:49.655 --> 02:08:50.656
FROM EITHER ANOTHER NATION

02:08:50.722 --> 02:08:51.790
ANOTHER STATE THAT DOESN'T HAVE

02:08:51.857 --> 02:08:53.892
THE SAME. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

02:08:53.959 --> 02:08:55.928
THAT WE HAVE HERE. AND SO I

02:08:55.994 --> 02:08:57.396
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE

02:08:57.463 --> 02:08:58.964
LEAKAGES AND IT DOESN'T SEEM

02:08:59.031 --> 02:09:01.100
THAT WE CAN GET AN ANSWER ON

02:09:01.166 --> 02:09:02.468
THAT BUT I DO KNOW- AT LEAST IN

02:09:02.534 --> 02:09:04.136
MY DISTRICT THAT THERE ARE MANY

02:09:04.203 --> 02:09:06.872
COMPANIES THAT- HAVE RELOCATED.

02:09:06.939 --> 02:09:09.074
TO NEVADA OR SOME OTHER STATE OR

02:09:09.141 --> 02:09:10.676
ACTUALLY OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND

02:09:10.742 --> 02:09:13.312
THEY'RE SHIPPING- THOSE PRODUCTS

02:09:13.378 --> 02:09:14.947
BACK INTO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE

02:09:15.013 --> 02:09:16.982
IT'S- THEY CAN DO IT CHEAPER

02:09:17.049 --> 02:09:17.916
THERE THAN ON THE REGULATORY

02:09:17.983 --> 02:09:19.184
ENVIRONMENT AND- WE'RE STILL

02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:21.386
USING THOSE SO- THAT HURTS OUR

02:09:21.453 --> 02:09:23.555
TAX BASE AND IT HURTS OUR JOB

02:09:23.622 --> 02:09:25.124
MARKET HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN HER

02:09:25.190 --> 02:09:26.592
SEAT VARMINT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

02:09:26.658 --> 02:09:29.194
FOLLOWING THE SAME. LAWS THAT WE

02:09:29.261 --> 02:09:32.364
HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO TO

02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:33.665
LEAD THE NATION. WELL WE NEED TO

02:09:33.732 --> 02:09:35.601
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD.

02:09:35.667 --> 02:09:36.702
GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THE IN THE

PRODUCTS THAT WE NEED. THAT

02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:40.405
DELIVERED TO CALIFORNIA ARE

02:09:40.472 --> 02:09:42.274
ACTUALLY PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA.

02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:44.510
AND I'M LIKE WHAT WE'VE SEEN.

02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:46.445
OVER THE PAST A COUPLE YEARS NOW

02:09:46.512 --> 02:09:48.580

PRODUCING AS MUCH AS WE CAN IN

02:09:51.617 --> 02:09:52.918
CALIFORNIA BUT WE'RE EXPERTS

02:09:52.985 --> 02:09:54.853
OVER BRINGING EXPERTS IN FROM

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:56.421
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE

02:09:56.488 --> 02:09:57.723
THE SAME. REGULATORY

02:09:57.789 --> 02:09:58.323
ENVIRONMENT. WHICH WOULD MEAN

02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:59.825
THAT WE'RE STILL. MORE POLLUTING

02:09:59.892 --> 02:10:02.161
THE WORLD. SOMEWHERE ELSE NOT

02:10:02.227 --> 02:10:05.097
HERE AND DRIVING THE COST OF

02:10:05.164 --> 02:10:07.099
LIVING UP IN CALIFORNIA THANK

02:10:07.166 --> 02:10:08.033
YOU FOR YOUR- INFORMATION I LOOK

FORWARD TO- THE LEAKAGE

02:10:09.968 --> 02:10:11.336
INFORMATION FROM SOMEBODY I

02:10:11.403 --> 02:10:12.671
DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD SUPPLY THAT

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:14.640
MAYBE ELLY ELLS OFFICE- COULD DO

02:10:14.706 --> 02:10:16.575
A STUDY ON HOW MUCH HOW MANY

02:10:16.642 --> 02:10:18.944
JOBS WE ARE HOW MANY COMPANIES

02:10:19.011 --> 02:10:20.078
HAVE LEFT CALIFORNIA- OVER THE

02:10:20.145 --> 02:10:21.947
PAST TEN YEARS. DUE TO THE

02:10:22.014 --> 02:10:23.282
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT BUT STILL

SELL THEIR PRODUCTS HERE. THAT

02:10:26.084 --> 02:10:28.687
SHOULD BE THE CARPENTRY BUT-

02:10:28.754 --> 02:10:32.858
PORTION OF THE AIRPORT- WE'VE

02:10:32.925 --> 02:10:34.726
BEEN INSTRUCTED BY THE ALLEY- TO

02:10:34.793 --> 02:10:36.528
MAKE SURE THAT THE PROCEEDS FROM

02:10:36.595 --> 02:10:38.497
OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM DON'T

02:10:38.564 --> 02:10:41.033
GO TO THE COVERED ENTITY'S

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:43.168
SWITCHER 75% OF THE POLLUTING

02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:45.737
ENTITIES WE SEE THAT THE

02:10:45.804 --> 02:10:47.506
INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION AND

02:10:47.573 --> 02:10:50.676
THE FOOD PRODUCTION- INVESTMENTS

02:10:50.742 --> 02:10:53.912
OUR GENERAL FUND- HIGH

02:10:53.979 --> 02:10:55.747
INVESTMENTS NOT CAP AND TRADE

02:10:55.814 --> 02:10:57.916
REVENUES OF. WE SEE THAT BUT

02:10:57.983 --> 02:10:59.418
ALSO THERE'S JUST A GENERAL

02:10:59.484 --> 02:11:01.920
FLAVOR THAT THE POLLUTER SHOULD

02:11:01.987 --> 02:11:05.190
PAY BUT WE KNEW THAT WE SAY IF

02:11:05.257 --> 02:11:06.325
YOU'RE POLLUTING IF YOU'RE

02:11:06.391 --> 02:11:09.461
EXTERNALITIES ARE SET TO BE

02:11:09.528 --> 02:11:11.763
PAYING FOR THAT SO. CAN YOU.

02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:14.333
EITHER CLARIFY OUR- THESE MONIES

02:11:14.399 --> 02:11:17.135
ANTICIPATED TO GO TO THE 25% OF

02:11:17.202 --> 02:11:18.337
THE POLLUTERS THAT ARE NOT

02:11:18.403 --> 02:11:24.843
COVERED AS A CARROT. FOR THE

02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:26.845
FOOD PRODUCTION INVESTMENTS IN

02:11:26.912 --> 02:11:30.349
THE INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION.

02:11:30.415 --> 02:11:31.717
BETTER I CAN TAKE THAT QUESTION

02:11:31.783 --> 02:11:33.318
IT WOULD- OUR OUR INTENTION IS

02:11:33.385 --> 02:11:35.754
NOT TO NARROW THEFIELD OF

02:11:35.821 --> 02:11:36.822
POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS WE WOULD

02:11:36.888 --> 02:11:39.925
NOT BE FUNDING DIRECTLY- THE

02:11:39.992 --> 02:11:41.493
COST ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:43.862
COMPLIANCE BUT WE WOULD BE

02:11:43.929 --> 02:11:45.831
BRINGING DOWN- COMPANIES AS AS

02:11:45.897 --> 02:11:47.299
WE'VE SEEN WITH THE FOOD FOOD

02:11:47.366 --> 02:11:48.800
PRODUCERS PROGRAM WE WOULD BE

02:11:48.867 --> 02:11:50.602
BRINGING DOWN THEIR COSTS. AND

02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:52.604
THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS THAT

02:11:52.671 --> 02:11:54.539
WE MAKE A STATE INVESTMENT WE

02:11:54.606 --> 02:11:57.276
WITH WITH- WITH AFTER WE WORK WE

02:11:57.342 --> 02:11:58.910
ARE FUNDED I BELIEVE IT WAS

02:11:58.977 --> 02:12:01.246
ABOUT 60% OF THE INVESTMENT WE

02:12:01.313 --> 02:12:03.215
REQUIRE 40% MATCH SO THE

02:12:03.282 --> 02:12:05.183
INDUSTRIES. ARE ALL REQUIRED TO

02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:07.352
PUT IN FUNDS THEMSELVES BUT ONCE

02:12:07.419 --> 02:12:08.987
THE PROJECTS ARE DONE THE

02:12:09.054 --> 02:12:10.756
SAVINGS ARE DURABLE THEY GO ON

02:12:10.822 --> 02:12:13.191
WELL INTO THE FUTURE SO ONCE THE

02:12:13.258 --> 02:12:13.692
EFFICIENCIES HAVE BEEN

02:12:13.759 --> 02:12:16.862
COMPLETED- THEY EVERY YEAR CAN

02:12:16.928 --> 02:12:18.797
SAVE MONEY IF THEY CAN HELP WITH

02:12:18.864 --> 02:12:20.732
THAT. QUESTION THE JOBCENTRE

02:12:20.799 --> 02:12:21.933
DOLLAR RAISED AS WELL ABOUT

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.104
COMPANIES- THE COMPANY'S COST.

02:12:26.171 --> 02:12:29.308
NO I NOT IN A WE HAD A- OUR

02:12:29.374 --> 02:12:30.142
ISSUE THAT TWO WE- ANIMATORS

02:12:30.208 --> 02:12:31.209
COACHING ABOUT THE COST PER

02:12:31.276 --> 02:12:33.512
METRIC TON AND MIKE MATHIS

02:12:33.578 --> 02:12:35.113
SAYING THAT THIS MAY BE THIRTY

02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:36.581
FIVE DOLLARS PER METRIC TON. AT

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:38.550
LEAST ON THE FOOD PRODUCTION.

02:12:38.617 --> 02:12:40.652
INVESTMENT SO YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:12:40.719 --> 02:12:45.023
IT'S RIGHT IT'S A- MERE. EIGHTY

02:12:45.090 --> 02:12:47.759

02:14:28.193 --> 02:14:29.694
JUST ELECTRIC APPLIANCES WE

02:14:29.761 --> 02:14:31.029
WOULD BE LOOKING AT BUILDING

02:14:31.096 --> 02:14:33.198
ENVELOPE SO INSULATION WINDOWS

02:14:33.265 --> 02:14:35.200
ETCETERA AND YES THERE ARE

02:14:35.267 --> 02:14:37.135
SIMILARITIES TO WHAT SHE HAS TO

02:14:37.202 --> 02:14:39.671
THE COMMUNITY- CHOOSE A

02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:41.740
DEVELOPMENT THAT DIVISION DOES-

02:14:41.807 --> 02:14:43.542
BUT IT WOULD WE'VE HAD

02:14:43.608 --> 02:14:45.110
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM WE DO

02:14:45.177 --> 02:14:46.478
THINK THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS

02:14:46.545 --> 02:14:47.446
THE RIGHT ENTERTAINMENT TO

02:14:47.512 --> 02:14:49.247
MANAGE THESE FUNDS. THE PROGRAM

02:14:49.314 --> 02:14:51.650
IS MUCH NARROWER- IT FOCUSES

02:14:51.716 --> 02:14:54.119
MUCH MORE ON INTEREST ENVELOPE

02:14:54.186 --> 02:14:54.686
SO WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT A

02:14:54.753 --> 02:15:00.258
COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE. PACKAGE

02:15:00.325 --> 02:15:02.327
THAT- APPLE MAPS BUT- DOESN'T

02:15:02.394 --> 02:15:03.628
DUPLICATE WHAT THEY- AND WILL BE

02:15:03.695 --> 02:15:05.630
CLOSELY TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE

02:15:05.697 --> 02:15:06.765
THAT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT YOU

02:15:06.832 --> 02:15:08.066
KNOW NOT DOING THE SAME SORT OF

02:15:08.133 --> 02:15:09.601
THING IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOODS

02:15:09.668 --> 02:15:10.735
IN THE SAME. CERTAINLY NOT THE

02:15:10.802 --> 02:15:13.238
SAME TOPICS. MR BROWN ARE YOU

02:15:13.305 --> 02:15:14.139

WINDOWS TO SCUM HELLO YOU KNOW

02:15:22.848 --> 02:15:25.317
LOW HANGING FRUIT FOR WEATHER

02:15:25.383 --> 02:15:29.888
RISING- OUR APARTMENTS AND HOMES

02:15:29.955 --> 02:15:31.256
AND BUSINESSES. DID I MISS IT IN

02:15:31.323 --> 02:15:33.825
THE BUDGET. WELL THAT WOULD BE

02:15:33.892 --> 02:15:36.161
THAT. OTHER THAN THIS PROPOSAL

02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:38.263
JUST THE JUST THE EXISTING

02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:41.867
PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE THAT UP

02:15:41.933 --> 02:15:43.034
WITH OTHER AGENCIES NOT WITH THE

02:15:43.101 --> 02:15:44.336
ENERGY COMMISSION. YEAH I

02:15:44.402 --> 02:15:46.371
APOLOGIES IF- RIGHT I THINK IT

FINANCE MIGHT HAVE SOME

02:15:57.816 --> 02:15:58.783
INFORMATION ON THAT I THINK

02:15:58.850 --> 02:16:01.019
THERE WAS. SOME FUNDING FOR A

02:16:01.086 --> 02:16:01.620

BACK AND DOUBLE CHECK THAT.

02:16:09.628 --> 02:16:10.695
THERE IS SOME KIND OF GOING BACK

02:16:10.762 --> 02:16:13.365
TO THE FEDERAL FUNDING ISSUE AS

02:16:13.431 --> 02:16:13.932
PART OF THE FEDERAL

02:16:13.999 --> 02:16:14.533
INFRASTRUCTURE. PACKAGE THERE

02:16:14.599 --> 02:16:16.501
WAS A FINDING OF ADDITIONAL

02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:18.403
FUNDING FOR WEATHERIZATION TYPE

02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:20.939
ACTIVITIES- AND CST KIND OF HAS

02:16:21.006 --> 02:16:22.908
ITS KIND OF ONGOING PROGRAMS

02:16:22.974 --> 02:16:24.442
RELATED TO THAT ISSUE SO. THERE

02:16:24.509 --> 02:16:26.177
IS SOME MONEY IN THERE AND HAVE

02:16:26.244 --> 02:16:27.779

AND TRY TO PULL TOGETHER SOME OF

02:16:29.648 --> 02:16:30.582
THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES THAT ARE

02:16:30.649 --> 02:16:32.918
KIND OF SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE

02:16:32.984 --> 02:16:35.987

REAL QUICK AND- YET. THEY'RE

02:16:41.893 --> 02:16:43.161
LUCKY CAREER FUNDING PROVIDED AT

02:16:43.228 --> 02:16:45.063
PART OF LAST YEAR'S MULTI YEAR

02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:47.799
PACKAGE OF BILLS. IN TWENTY TWO

02:16:47.866 --> 02:16:50.435
TWENTY THREE THERE'S NOTHING

FOUR ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE MILLION

02:16:53.805 --> 02:16:55.574
IMPORTS YEAH. THE LOW INCOME

02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:56.841
WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM SO THERE

02:16:56.908 --> 02:16:59.344
IS ALREADY. A FUNDING. IN THE

02:16:59.411 --> 02:17:04.249
BUDGET WORD A COUPLE YEARS. YEAH

02:17:04.316 --> 02:17:04.950

NINE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION

02:17:12.657 --> 02:17:14.593
TWENTY FIVE MILLION SO WE CAN I

02:17:14.659 --> 02:17:16.094
REMEMBER THOSE DEBATES WITH

02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:18.830
FINANCE TO GET THAT TWENTY FIVE

02:17:18.897 --> 02:17:20.098
MILLION IN THERE THAT DIDN'T PAN

02:17:20.165 --> 02:17:21.900
IN THE BUDGET DISCUSSION SO I

02:17:21.967 --> 02:17:24.169
JUST DRAW SOME ATTENTION DEAR TO

02:17:24.235 --> 02:17:26.204
SOME OF THE LESS POPULAR TYPE

02:17:26.271 --> 02:17:28.506
PROGRAMS THAT ACHIEVE OUR

02:17:28.573 --> 02:17:32.110
CLIMATE GOALS SO MAYBE WE SHOULD

02:17:32.177 --> 02:17:35.280
STEP BACK IN IN THE PAST THE

02:17:35.347 --> 02:17:37.382
OVERALL STRATEGY YEAH BECAUSE

02:17:37.449 --> 02:17:39.818
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE LONG TERM

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:41.419
VERSUS THE SHORT TERM AND YOU

02:17:41.486 --> 02:17:43.288
KNOW SOME OF THE BUILDING

02:17:43.355 --> 02:17:44.756
DECARBONIZATION AND THE

02:17:44.823 --> 02:17:47.058
REFRIGERATION PROGRAMS CREATE

02:17:47.125 --> 02:17:49.527
MUCH MORE BENEFITS IN THE SHORT

02:17:49.594 --> 02:17:51.429
TERM. AND I GUESS I'M LOOKING

02:17:51.496 --> 02:17:53.198
FOR THE THOUGHT PROCESS TO SEE

02:17:53.264 --> 02:17:55.066
MINISTRATION WENT THROUGH WHEN

02:17:55.133 --> 02:17:57.469
BALANCING THE SHORT TERM VERSUS

02:17:57.535 --> 02:17:59.904
LONG TERM INVESTMENTS- AND IS

02:17:59.971 --> 02:18:01.940
THERE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT DOING

02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:03.875
MORE IN THE SHORT TERM TO DRIVE

02:18:03.942 --> 02:18:06.044
STEEPER EMISSIONS. IN THE NEAR

02:18:06.111 --> 02:18:08.613
TERM YOU KNOW I GUESS AGAIN TO

02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:10.548
FIGHT. LET'S JUST BRING UP THE

02:18:10.615 --> 02:18:11.850
REFRIGERANT PROGRAM PUT MORE

02:18:11.916 --> 02:18:14.452
MONEY IN THERE TO GET THE GET

02:18:14.519 --> 02:18:19.457
THE BENEFIT OF IT. US SENATOR.

02:18:19.524 --> 02:18:21.593
REBEL AND I WOULD RESPOND. TO

02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:24.295
THAT BY SAYING IF YOU LOOK AT

02:18:24.362 --> 02:18:25.997
THE- BIG TICKET ITEMS THAT WOULD

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:27.098
BE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE ENERGY

02:18:27.165 --> 02:18:30.001
COMMISSION- ABOUT HALF THE

02:18:30.068 --> 02:18:32.070
FUNDING. GOES TOWARDS BUILDING

02:18:32.137 --> 02:18:33.805
THIS IS VERY SHORT TERM SO WE

02:18:33.872 --> 02:18:35.173
NEED TO BUILD THE PROGRAM WE

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:36.641
NEED TO DO THE PUBLIC OUTRAGE TO

02:18:36.708 --> 02:18:38.910
MAKE SURE WE ARE WE'RE DESIGNING

02:18:38.977 --> 02:18:40.412
IT PROPERLY WE WANT TO BE A MIX

02:18:40.478 --> 02:18:42.414
OF THE SORT OF- WHY WITH TYPE

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:44.649
STUFF THAT. THE INSULATION- THE

02:18:44.716 --> 02:18:47.085
WEATHER IS ATION. COUPLED WITH

02:18:47.152 --> 02:18:48.620
THE LONGER TERM SO EVEN IN ONE

02:18:48.687 --> 02:18:50.088
PROGRAM WE'RE LOOKING AT PAUL

02:18:50.155 --> 02:18:51.856
FOR A LOOK AT A QUICK INSTALLS

02:18:51.923 --> 02:18:53.091
DON'T HAPPEN QUICKLY. BUT THE-

02:18:53.158 --> 02:18:54.426
ADDRESS BOTH THE IMMEDIATE

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:56.127
PRODUCTION AND DEMAND-

02:18:56.194 --> 02:18:59.964
ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS AND

02:19:00.031 --> 02:19:01.866
THEY'LL START MOVING TOWARDS-

02:19:01.933 --> 02:19:03.668
GETTING MORE ELECTRIC APPLIANCES

02:19:03.735 --> 02:19:05.737
IN THE- HOMES. THAT THEY CAN

02:19:05.804 --> 02:19:08.640
HELP WITH OUR- COMMUNITY OUT

02:19:08.707 --> 02:19:10.141
THERE TO BUILD THE- THE-

02:19:10.208 --> 02:19:12.010
BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT IS IN

02:19:12.077 --> 02:19:16.347
THE BUSINESS- MAKING YOUR-

02:19:16.414 --> 02:19:17.482
CONNECTIONS. IN THOSE SORTS OF

02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:19.184
THINGS SO THAT ONE DEFINITELY A

02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:20.018
SHORT TERM. INDUSTRIAL AFTER

02:19:20.085 --> 02:19:21.586
THAT YOU POINTED OUT VERY GOOD

02:19:21.653 --> 02:19:24.723
VALUE LOW COST PER PER TON- ALSO

02:19:24.789 --> 02:19:26.725
VERY QUICK WE'VE WE'VE GOT MANY

02:19:26.791 --> 02:19:27.625
OF THOSE PROJECTS COMPLETE

02:19:27.692 --> 02:19:28.593
ALREADY AND IT'S ONLY A COUPLE

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:30.428
YEAR OLD PROGRAM. WE THINK IT'LL

02:19:30.495 --> 02:19:32.664
STILL BE CURRENT CAN BE THE SAME

02:19:32.731 --> 02:19:34.099
THING. THE OTHER ONES ARE LONGER

02:19:34.165 --> 02:19:34.966
TERM WE ARE LOOKING AT LONGER

02:19:35.033 --> 02:19:36.935
RATIONS STORAGE AS A GOOD

02:19:37.001 --> 02:19:39.003
EXAMPLE OF. IF YOU TAKE THIS CAN

02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:40.505
TAKE SOME INVESTMENTS WE'VE GOT

02:19:40.572 --> 02:19:41.339
SOME TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE'VE

02:19:41.406 --> 02:19:42.907
INVESTED IN WE'VE GOT OTHERS

02:19:42.974 --> 02:19:44.976
THAT WE SPENT STUDYING. AND WE

02:19:45.043 --> 02:19:46.511
BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE

02:19:46.578 --> 02:19:47.679
JUST ON THE CUSP OF BEING ABLE

02:19:47.746 --> 02:19:49.714
TO SCALE AND SO THESE

02:19:49.781 --> 02:19:50.982
INVESTMENTS WILL YIELD RESULTS

02:19:51.049 --> 02:19:52.650
IN THE SAME TIME FRAME AS THE

02:19:52.717 --> 02:19:54.252
OTHERS. BUT THEY THEY WERE

02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:55.854
HOPEFUL THAT THEY COULD BE

02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:58.123
AVAILABLE QUICKLY HI JIM ALSO

02:19:58.189 --> 02:19:59.357
WHEN SIMILARLY THESE TAKE A

02:19:59.424 --> 02:20:01.459
LITTLE BIT LONGER. ARE ARE YOU.

02:20:01.526 --> 02:20:02.961
ARE REPEATS THE MOST EFFECTIVE

02:20:03.027 --> 02:20:04.829
WAY TO DRIVE THE KIND OF-

02:20:04.896 --> 02:20:06.197
APPLIANCES ADAPTATION YOU'RE

02:20:06.264 --> 02:20:08.700
TALKING ABOUT HERE. OTHER OTHER

02:20:08.767 --> 02:20:09.801
SORT OF POLICY TOOLS YOU COULD

02:20:09.868 --> 02:20:12.637
USE. ORDERED I MEAN THAT'S

02:20:12.704 --> 02:20:16.341
BECAUSE- IDEALLY WE'D WE'D- WE-

02:20:16.407 --> 02:20:17.675
REALLY LIKED THE FLEXIBILITY WE

02:20:17.742 --> 02:20:19.844
PUT FORTH THE DIVISION OF TWO

02:20:19.911 --> 02:20:21.212
THIRDS ONE THIRD TWO THIRDS

02:20:21.279 --> 02:20:23.882
DIRECT INSTALL FOR A REBATE. BUT

02:20:23.948 --> 02:20:25.583
WE WHAT WE WANT TO WORKSHOP THAT

02:20:25.650 --> 02:20:27.886
AND FIND OUT IN ONE MAY PROVE TO

02:20:27.952 --> 02:20:29.821
BE A BIT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE

02:20:29.888 --> 02:20:30.889
OTHER WE HAVE ESTIMATES ON WHAT

02:20:30.955 --> 02:20:32.590
THE COST PER TON WILL BE FOR

02:20:32.657 --> 02:20:35.627
EACH. BUT YOU KNOW WE KNOW WE'VE

02:20:35.693 --> 02:20:37.996
GOT A LOT TO LEARN AND EXPECT TO

02:20:38.062 --> 02:20:43.802
DO SO DURING THE- DURING THE-

02:20:43.868 --> 02:20:45.436
OPERATION THAT WE CONDUCTED.

02:20:45.503 --> 02:20:46.871
WELL I KNOW THAT THE- TURNING TO

02:20:46.938 --> 02:20:48.339
THE FEDERAL FUNDS THEY'RE

02:20:48.406 --> 02:20:50.074
SIGNIFICANT FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR

02:20:50.141 --> 02:20:53.077
THE SIMILAR ACTIVITIES HELLO IN

02:20:53.144 --> 02:20:54.045
TWENTY THREE OF OUR STAFF REPORT

02:20:54.112 --> 02:20:55.313
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CLEAN

02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:57.816
ENERGY HYDROGEN HUBS I'LL JUST

02:20:57.882 --> 02:21:00.652
NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE

02:21:00.718 --> 02:21:02.620
SECOND MOST HYDROGEN STATIONS IN

02:21:02.687 --> 02:21:05.523
THE WORLD. IN BED NEXT TO JAPAN

02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:06.891
AND I KNOW THAT ENERGY

02:21:06.958 --> 02:21:08.493
COMMISSION IS PROUD OF THAT AND

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:10.361
IF WE JUST DO THE TWO HUNDRED

02:21:10.428 --> 02:21:11.763
STATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE

02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:13.531
BOOKS WE WILL BE NUMBER ONE IN

02:21:13.598 --> 02:21:15.900
THE NATION SO HI RIGHT OF ALL

02:21:15.967 --> 02:21:17.669
THE THINGS I'M ANXIOUS ABOUT

02:21:17.735 --> 02:21:18.970
GETTING ONE OF THE FOUR ENERGY

02:21:19.037 --> 02:21:20.738
HUBS IS NOT ONE OF THEM RIGHT

02:21:20.805 --> 02:21:22.740
THAT'S NOT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

02:21:22.807 --> 02:21:24.209
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD DO BUT

02:21:24.275 --> 02:21:25.577
WE HAVE CARBON CAPTURE

02:21:25.643 --> 02:21:29.013
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. AND I

02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:29.848
KNOW NOTE THAT THE- THIS

02:21:29.914 --> 02:21:32.383
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS SILENT ON

02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:33.618
CARBON CAPTURE FOR

02:21:33.685 --> 02:21:36.120
ELECTRIFICATION CAN YOU. IS THAT

02:21:36.187 --> 02:21:39.090
BY DESIGN IS UP BY OVERSIGHT. N.

02:21:39.157 --> 02:21:44.062
N. Y. IF IT IS. WELL IN AN

02:21:44.128 --> 02:21:46.164
INDUSTRIAL THE CURVE WE ARE

02:21:46.231 --> 02:21:49.567
SUPPORTIVE OF- TAKING CARBON AND

02:21:49.634 --> 02:21:51.002
EMBEDDING IT IN PRODUCTS SO THAT

02:21:51.069 --> 02:21:52.604
FORM OF SEQUESTRATION WERE

02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:55.273
SUPPORTIVE OF WE DIDN'T THINK

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.775
THAT- THE TIME FRAMES ARE ARE

02:21:57.842 --> 02:22:00.211
ARE ARE. GOOD TO BE LOOKING AT

02:22:00.278 --> 02:22:01.546
INVESTING STATE DOLLARS IN IN

02:22:01.613 --> 02:22:04.349
THE IN THE- THE SITUATION I

02:22:04.415 --> 02:22:05.416
THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHERE

02:22:05.483 --> 02:22:06.851
WE YOU PUT IT UNDERGROUND OR

02:22:06.918 --> 02:22:09.254
OTHERWISE TRY TO MOVE IT OUT OF-

02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:10.555
OF THE ABSTRUSE LONG PERIODS OF

02:22:10.622 --> 02:22:12.190
TIME SO WE BEGIN WE'RE FOCUSING

02:22:12.257 --> 02:22:13.858
ON WHERE WE COULD PUT IN

02:22:13.925 --> 02:22:15.426
PRODUCTS. BUT THE BUT NOT THE

02:22:15.493 --> 02:22:16.728
OTHER PART IN YOUR RIGHT THERE

02:22:16.794 --> 02:22:19.430
IS QUITE A BIT OF MONEY IN IN

02:22:19.497 --> 02:22:20.865
THAT SPACE IN THE- IN THE

02:22:20.932 --> 02:22:21.933
FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE BILL.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.935
MISTER BROWN WE YOU READ THE-

02:22:24.002 --> 02:22:26.104
LIVERMORE LABS REPORTED SAID

02:22:26.170 --> 02:22:27.605
EVEN IF WE DO EVERYTHING THE

02:22:27.672 --> 02:22:30.208
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO DO. AND

02:22:30.275 --> 02:22:30.875
TWENTY FORTY FIVE WE'RE GOING TO

02:22:30.942 --> 02:22:31.976
BE A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT.

02:22:32.043 --> 02:22:34.245
METRIC TONS PER YEAR SHORT AND

02:22:34.312 --> 02:22:36.481
ONE OF THE ANSWERS HIS. NATURAL

02:22:36.547 --> 02:22:39.217
WORKING LANDS. AND DIRECT CARBON

02:22:39.284 --> 02:22:43.021
CAPTURE AND THEN- THE CARBON.

02:22:43.087 --> 02:22:44.889
ALL FASHION CARBON CAPTURE I

02:22:44.956 --> 02:22:48.092
GUESS I WOULD SAY- DOES THAT

02:22:48.159 --> 02:22:50.929
CONCERN YOU WE'VE GOT SO MUCH

02:22:50.995 --> 02:22:54.666
FEDERAL TOO ON THE- OUT THERE

02:22:54.732 --> 02:22:56.167
THAT WE COULD USE TO MEET OUR

02:22:56.234 --> 02:22:59.404
SHORT TERM AND MEDIUM TERM-

02:22:59.470 --> 02:23:00.772
CARBONATION PROBLEMS AND THEN

02:23:00.838 --> 02:23:03.441
WORK FOR LIMITING THE PROTECT

02:23:03.508 --> 02:23:04.542
THE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE GOOD TO

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:07.645
GO AFTER. YEAH AND ACTUALLY THIS

02:23:07.712 --> 02:23:10.548
IS- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE-

02:23:10.615 --> 02:23:11.616
HIGHLIGHTED ARE NOW ALSO SAYS

02:23:11.683 --> 02:23:13.618
WELL AND I JUST DIDN'T HAVE TIME

02:23:13.685 --> 02:23:15.520
TO KIND OF GET TO IT IN MY

02:23:15.586 --> 02:23:17.655
COMMENTS BUT- I THINK THAT IS AN

02:23:17.722 --> 02:23:18.856
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR THE

02:23:18.923 --> 02:23:19.791
LEGISLATURE I MEAN THERE ARE

02:23:19.857 --> 02:23:20.758
CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES IN CERTAIN

02:23:20.825 --> 02:23:22.093
TYPES OF CHRONIC CARBON

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:23.194
REDUCTION. ACTIONS THAT ARE

02:23:23.261 --> 02:23:25.363
EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM THIS

02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:27.432
PACKAGE AND THE- CARBON CAPTURE

02:23:27.498 --> 02:23:29.801
GEOLOGIC STORAGES IS ONE EXAMPLE

02:23:29.867 --> 02:23:32.670
OF THAT SO- I MEAN I THINK BIG

02:23:32.737 --> 02:23:35.373
PICTURE IN A MEETING- THE SORT

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:37.642
OF LONG TERM DECARBONISATION

02:23:37.709 --> 02:23:40.712
GOALS BY. TWENTY FORTY FIVE OR

02:23:40.778 --> 02:23:43.047
SOME OTHER TYPE OF SIMILAR DATE

02:23:43.114 --> 02:23:43.648
IS. IT'S FRANKLY- EXTREMELY

02:23:43.715 --> 02:23:44.949
CHALLENGING AND SO THE

02:23:45.016 --> 02:23:46.884
LEGISLATURE WILL I THINK NEED TO

02:23:46.951 --> 02:23:48.653
THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER IT

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:49.887
WANTS TO. TAKE CERTAIN TYPES OF

02:23:49.954 --> 02:23:51.990
OPTIONS OF TECHNOLOGY IS OFF THE

02:23:52.056 --> 02:23:53.091
TABLE TO KINDA YOU KNOW IN

02:23:53.157 --> 02:23:54.892
MEETING THAT GOAL AND SO WHEN

02:23:54.959 --> 02:23:56.794
THERE ARE SOME TRADE OFFS I MEAN

02:23:56.861 --> 02:23:58.129
IF YOU KIND OF FEEL EXPANDED TO

02:23:58.196 --> 02:23:59.664
A LARGER SET OF POTENTIAL

02:23:59.731 --> 02:24:00.765
TECHNOLOGIES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

02:24:00.832 --> 02:24:02.900
THAT COULD GO TO EACH. WOULD BE

02:24:02.967 --> 02:24:03.835
A LITTLE BIT LESS BUT WE DO

02:24:03.901 --> 02:24:05.837
THINK THAT AT THIS POINT KIND OF

02:24:05.903 --> 02:24:07.372
THINKING ABOUT THINGS AS BROADLY

02:24:07.438 --> 02:24:08.873
AS POSSIBLE AND KIND OF THING

02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:09.874
INCLUDING AS MANY DIFFERENT

02:24:09.941 --> 02:24:10.808
TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

02:24:10.875 --> 02:24:12.810
OUT THERE AND TRYING TO EXPLORE.

02:24:12.877 --> 02:24:13.845
WHICH ONES ARE ABLE TO KIND OF

02:24:13.911 --> 02:24:14.812
ACHIEVE THE GOALS COST

02:24:14.879 --> 02:24:16.547
EFFECTIVELY GOING FORWARD- AND

02:24:16.614 --> 02:24:17.515
KIND OF EXPLORING THOSE

02:24:17.582 --> 02:24:19.450
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES- WE THINK

02:24:19.517 --> 02:24:20.818
IT'S KIND OF A REASONABLE

02:24:20.885 --> 02:24:21.552
APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:24:21.619 --> 02:24:23.554
THINK ABOUT THINK ABOUT HOW TO

02:24:23.621 --> 02:24:24.655
EXPANDING THE- THE- OF THE OF

02:24:24.722 --> 02:24:26.457
TECHNOLOGIES AND KIND OF

02:24:26.524 --> 02:24:26.991
FACILITIES THAT COULD BE

02:24:27.058 --> 02:24:28.459
ELIGIBLE FOR THE FUNDING.

02:24:28.526 --> 02:24:31.396
THERE'S VALUE IN NEAR ZERO

02:24:31.462 --> 02:24:33.531
REDUCTIONS NOT ZERO BUT NEAR IS

02:24:33.598 --> 02:24:35.233
A REDUCTION IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S

02:24:35.299 --> 02:24:37.935
PATH. AS A MYSTERY I GUESS THE

02:24:38.002 --> 02:24:39.537
NEXT QUESTION IS THAT YOU KNOW

02:24:39.604 --> 02:24:41.406
SOME OF THESE FEDERAL PROGRAMS

02:24:41.472 --> 02:24:44.909
REQUIRE. A MATCH IN THE IN THE-

02:24:44.976 --> 02:24:46.444
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT

02:24:46.511 --> 02:24:48.246
ALLOCATE ANY STATEMENTS FOR THE

02:24:48.312 --> 02:24:50.281
GRID RESILIENCY AND I WAS

02:24:50.348 --> 02:24:54.118
WONDERING. AGAIN ON THE SAME

02:24:54.185 --> 02:24:56.220
SORT OF VEIN. WHY NOT IT'S A BIT

02:24:56.287 --> 02:24:58.489
TOO HIGHLIGHTED IN PAGE TWENTY

02:24:58.556 --> 02:25:05.029
THREE OF OUR OUR OUR. STAFF

02:25:05.096 --> 02:25:05.830
REPORT WHY ARE WE NOT. DOING

02:25:05.897 --> 02:25:07.698
THAT WHEN THE FEDERAL. YOU KNOW-

02:25:07.765 --> 02:25:08.866
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AND JOB CHECK

02:25:08.933 --> 02:25:11.569
WAS WAS OUT AND OCTOBER OR

02:25:11.636 --> 02:25:14.505
NOVEMBER WE KNOW ABOUT THAT. AND

02:25:14.572 --> 02:25:16.441
IF THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ANY

02:25:16.507 --> 02:25:18.176
OTHER GAPS IS OUR STAFF REPORT.

02:25:18.242 --> 02:25:22.613
TALKS ABOUT. BUT SENATOR I WOULD

02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:25.750
POINT TO THE THERE'S SEVERAL

02:25:25.817 --> 02:25:26.884
THERE'S A THERE'S A NUMBER OF

02:25:26.951 --> 02:25:28.719
DIFFERENT STATUTORY ELEMENTS

02:25:28.786 --> 02:25:31.122
UNDER GREATER LIABILITY AND WE

02:25:31.189 --> 02:25:32.990
WERE LOOKING AT A BROADLY AS

02:25:33.057 --> 02:25:34.525
OTHERS A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF

02:25:34.592 --> 02:25:36.527
THAT THAT IS FOR THAT IS A

02:25:36.594 --> 02:25:38.062
FORMULA GRANTS TO CALIFORNIA

02:25:38.129 --> 02:25:40.731
WILL GET. SHOULD IT BE A

02:25:40.798 --> 02:25:41.933
SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF ONE OF

02:25:41.999 --> 02:25:44.001
THOSE POTS OF MONEY WHICH IS A

02:25:44.068 --> 02:25:47.004
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE

02:25:47.071 --> 02:25:47.839
USING IS A ROUGH. ESTIMATE

02:25:47.905 --> 02:25:50.308
THAT'S 10% OF THAT SO CALIFORNIA

02:25:50.374 --> 02:25:51.242
IS LOOKING TO GET FIVE OR

02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:52.844
MILLION- FROM THE- FROM THE

02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:54.412
FORMULA GRANTS. THERE'S ANOTHER

02:25:54.479 --> 02:25:56.681
FIVE BILLION IN VERY SIMILAR

02:25:56.747 --> 02:25:57.515
IT'S WORDED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY

02:25:57.582 --> 02:25:59.550
BUT IT'S VERY SIMILAR FUNDING

02:25:59.617 --> 02:26:00.585
FOR GRADE A LOT GREATER

02:26:00.651 --> 02:26:03.121
LIABILITY. AGAIN ALSO FIVE

02:26:03.187 --> 02:26:05.022
BILLION AND THAT'S COMPETITIVE.

02:26:05.089 --> 02:26:06.858
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER POT

02:26:06.924 --> 02:26:08.025
SHOULD SHIP WITH UNDER THAT

02:26:08.092 --> 02:26:10.128
WITHIN THAT SO WE'RE LOOKING OF

02:26:10.194 --> 02:26:12.663
COURSE AT THE FORMULA GRANT. AND

02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:14.599
WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN.

02:26:14.665 --> 02:26:15.900
LEVERAGE THE EXPERIENCE WE'VE

02:26:15.967 --> 02:26:18.336
GOT PERHAPS SOME OF THE FUNDING

02:26:18.402 --> 02:26:20.171
WE WE'RE WE'RE SEEKING THE LONG

02:26:20.238 --> 02:26:22.173
DURATION STORAGE FUNDING COULD

02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:24.942
BE MATCH FOR- FOR THE SCREEN

02:26:25.009 --> 02:26:26.577
RELIABILITY IT'S NOT CERTAIN YET

02:26:26.644 --> 02:26:27.912
WE'RE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:26:27.979 --> 02:26:29.780
DELIA. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL

02:26:29.847 --> 02:26:31.682
WORKING ON A LOT OF THESE

02:26:31.749 --> 02:26:32.583
PROGRAMS BUT WE THINK THERE MAY

02:26:32.650 --> 02:26:34.619
BE A WAYS TO LEVERAGE SOME OF

02:26:34.685 --> 02:26:37.088
THE STATE'S FUNDING. AS A AS A

02:26:37.155 --> 02:26:38.022
FORM OF MATCH FOR THAT ONE

02:26:38.089 --> 02:26:41.826
CERTAINLY THAT'S TRUE FOR

02:26:41.893 --> 02:26:42.760
HYDROGEN. AND SOME OF THE OTHER.

02:26:42.827 --> 02:26:44.629
HELLO AND THAT DOG MILLION MORE

02:26:44.695 --> 02:26:45.663
CHECKING FOR. COULD BE USED

02:26:45.730 --> 02:26:47.165
LEVERAGE THE- NINE POINT FIVE

02:26:47.231 --> 02:26:48.032
BILLION DOLLARS IN HYDROGEN

02:26:48.099 --> 02:26:51.235
FUNDING. AND THAT'S NOT FOCUSED

02:26:51.302 --> 02:26:53.070
CHIEFLY ON ON VEHICLES IT'S MORE

02:26:53.137 --> 02:26:55.473
ON OTHER ASPECTS OF HOW HIGH SHE

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:57.241
CAN PLAY A ROLE IN THE ECONOMY.

02:26:57.308 --> 02:26:59.377
BUT I MEAN WE HAVE A THIGH AGAIN

02:26:59.443 --> 02:27:01.245
LIMIT WE'RE WITH THAT. THEN WITH

02:27:01.312 --> 02:27:02.847
THE ANTICIPATED ADDITIONAL

02:27:02.914 --> 02:27:04.949
REVENUES COMING IN IT SEEMS LIKE

02:27:05.016 --> 02:27:07.018
THOSE ARE. YOU KNOW WE'RE I'VE

02:27:07.084 --> 02:27:08.386
BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOOK AT

02:27:08.452 --> 02:27:09.520
PROJECTS ARE LOOK AT.

02:27:09.587 --> 02:27:11.789
INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD HELP US

02:27:11.856 --> 02:27:13.891
COME UNDER THE CAN LIMIT- AND IT

02:27:13.958 --> 02:27:15.626
SEEMS TO ME IF THE FEDERAL

02:27:15.693 --> 02:27:16.527
GOVERNMENT'S PUTTING MONEY IN.

02:27:16.594 --> 02:27:18.429
AND JUST SIT. THIS PICKING

02:27:18.496 --> 02:27:20.331
CARBON CAPTURE THIS HERE THAT WE

02:27:20.398 --> 02:27:21.866
WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT.

02:27:21.933 --> 02:27:23.267
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

02:27:23.334 --> 02:27:25.203
PARALLELS THOUGH SO THAT WE CAN

02:27:25.269 --> 02:27:26.637
PARTICIPATE AT LEAST

02:27:26.704 --> 02:27:28.439
COMPETITIVELY. INSTEAD OF.

02:27:28.506 --> 02:27:30.408
CHOOSING WINNERS AND LOSERS NOW

GET TO. BUY MY SHINY PENNY SIZED

02:27:38.616 --> 02:27:43.120
IN THE SKY. OKAY- I THINK WE'RE

02:27:43.187 --> 02:27:44.922
GOING TO HOLD THIS OPEN-

02:27:44.989 --> 02:27:46.724
OBVIOUSLY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

02:27:46.791 --> 02:27:47.758
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE

02:27:47.825 --> 02:27:49.727
LOOKING FOR ON FOR ALL THE

02:27:49.794 --> 02:27:53.731
AGENCIES HERE- SO WE CAN
