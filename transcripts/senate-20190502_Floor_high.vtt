CHARACTER INTO THE CLEAR

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:10.254
DEPARTURE FROM THE BEHAVIOR THAT

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:11.822
SHE HAD EXHIBITED.

00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:13.290
THAT LED TO THE CHARGE.

00:38:13.357 --> 00:38:15.426
BUT GIVEN THAT THERE WERE NO

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:17.895
DIVERSION COURT OPTIONS.

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:20.064
SHE WAS SENTENCED AND SERVED

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:21.832
THREE YEARS AT THE POINT THAT

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:24.702
SHE STARTED HER INCARCERATION.

00:38:24.769 --> 00:38:26.237
HER DAUGHTER WAS THREE YEARS OLD.

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:27.271
AT THE POINT THAT SHE WAS

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:29.874
REUNITED WITH HER FAMILY AND HER

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.308
DAUGHTER.

00:38:31.375 --> 00:38:31.976
THE DAUGHTER DIDN'T REALLY EVEN

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:34.311
KNOW HER NOR DID ACTUALLY KNOW

00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:36.147
HER CHILD.

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:37.848
AND THEY HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:40.751
WITH THAT DETACHMENT SINCE THAT

00:38:40.818 --> 00:38:43.888
TIME IN HER DAUGHTER ASIA

00:38:43.954 --> 00:38:45.823
TESTIFIED TO COMMITTEE.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:47.324
IT WAS VERY VERY POWERFUL NOW

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:49.760
CLEARLY SUCH A DIVERSION COURT

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.529
IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR ALL

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:54.198
DEFENDANTS AND THAT IS WHY THE

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:56.500
BILL IS DESIGNED NUMBER ONE TO

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:58.569
EXCLUDE THOSE WITH SERIOUS AND

00:38:58.636 --> 00:38:59.670
VIOLENT FELONIES.

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:01.872
AND ADDITIONALLY TO REQUIRE THE

00:39:01.939 --> 00:39:04.442
PRESIDING JUDGE THE DA AND THE

00:39:04.508 --> 00:39:06.744
PUBLIC DEFENDER TO ALL AGREE

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:08.779
BEFORE THAT DEFENDANT CAN HAVE

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:11.682
THAT OPTION FOR DIVERSION COURT.

00:39:11.749 --> 00:39:13.317
AND WITH THAT I ASK YOU TO

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:17.054
SUPPORT SB.

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:17.655
THREE NINETY FOUR IS THERE ANY

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:18.656
DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS

00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:20.491
ITEM.

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:22.560
SENATOR GROVE THANK YOU MADAM

REALIZE THERE'S NO DEBATE ON THE

00:39:32.403 --> 00:39:33.437
FLOOR BUT I DO HAVE SOME

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:36.607
QUESTIONS I'D LIKE CLARIFIED --

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:38.209
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS --

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:39.343
PROGRAM IS MODELED AFTER THE

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.644
VETERANS COURT THAT'S BEEN

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:42.813
SUCCESSFUL I NEED TO KNOW IF

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.914

THE JUDGE HAVE I DON'T SEE VETO

00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:51.555
POWER BUT THEY HAVE SOME THEY

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:53.824
CAN OBJECT TO SOMEONE.

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:55.593
GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS IF

00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:57.695
THEY FEEL THAT THIS PERSON IS A

00:39:57.762 --> 00:39:59.697
THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY OR IF

00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:01.398
THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THE

00:40:01.465 --> 00:40:02.933
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S FILL THAT --

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.435
THIS THE PERSON THAT IS IN

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:06.637
QUESTION DOES NOT MEET THE

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:07.938
QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PROGRAM.

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:09.774
AND NUMBER THREE AND I HATE THAT

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.208
THERE'S THREE BUT IT IS.

00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:12.543
IF THEY GO THROUGH THIS

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.911
DIVERSION PROGRAM AND THEY DO

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:15.980
NOT SUCCESSFULLY STAY ON THE

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:18.415
PROGRAM COMPLETE ALL THE CLASSES

00:40:18.482 --> 00:40:19.917
THAT ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE THEM.

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:21.819
OF OF A BETTER MEMBER OF SOCIETY

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:23.821
LIKE JOBS AND YOU KNOW THINGS

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:24.388
THAT ARE IN THE PROGRAM FOR

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:25.256
DIVERSION.

00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:27.691
IF IF THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IS

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:30.227
CAN THEY GO BACK TO TRIAL OR IS

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:30.861

00:40:32.129 --> 00:40:32.963
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.331
SO IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT THAT

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:37.101
WOULD BE HELPFUL I REALLY

00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:38.402

SAYING NINE FIVE CENTER SKINNER

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:54.051
MINORITY LEADER SCHOOL QUESTIONS

00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:55.186
WHICH I WILL ADDRESS IN THIS

00:40:55.252 --> 00:40:57.588
CLOSE SO AS I INDICATED IN MY

00:40:57.655 --> 00:41:00.791
OPENING.

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:03.460
THIS DIVERSION COURT IF WE WERE

00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:05.095
TO ESTABLISH IT.

00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:06.897
WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO A

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:09.266
DEFENDANT ON LESS.

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:10.334
ALL.

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:12.436
THREE THE JUDGE.

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:13.537
THE DA.

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:15.573
AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER AGREE

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:16.106
AND THEY HAVE TO AGREE IN

00:41:16.173 --> 00:41:17.608
WRITING.

00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:19.777
THAT'S EXPLICIT IN THE BILL

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:20.077
[inaudible]

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:23.514
AND THE PROGRAM IS MODELED AFTER

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:25.816
ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL VETERANS

00:41:25.883 --> 00:41:28.052
DIVERSION COURT WHICH WE

00:41:28.118 --> 00:41:30.788
RECOGNIZED IN ESTABLISHING IT WE

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:32.890
RECOGNIZED THAT OUR VETERANS.

00:41:32.957 --> 00:41:33.824
COME BACK [inaudible]

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:36.827
AND THEY'VE SUFFERED GREAT

00:41:36.894 --> 00:41:39.597
TRAUMA FROM THEIR EXPERIENCES IN

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:41.298
OUR IN THEIR SERVICE ON OUR

00:41:41.365 --> 00:41:42.800
BEHALF.

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:44.969
AND WE NOT ONLY HAVE THEY

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:46.871
SUFFERED THIS DRAMA THEY'VE ALSO

00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:49.607
UNFORTUNATELY ARE EXPERIENCING

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:52.243
SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THEIR

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.911
ABILITY TO ACCESS.

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:55.946
THERE THE SERVICES THAT ARE

00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:56.580
VETERANS DEPARTMENT WOULD OFFER

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:57.681
THEM.

00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:59.950
SO NOW DOES THAT JUSTIFY ANY

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:01.952
TYPE OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR NO BUT

00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:04.021
IT CERTAINLY WE WE HAVE

00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:06.323
UNDERSTOOD THAT IT CAN LEAD A

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:08.259
PERSON TO BEHAVIORS THAT.

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:09.960
WE DON'T FIND ACCEPTABLE BUT

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:11.962
THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE TO HAVE THE

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:15.132
ABILITY TO FACTOR THOSE THINGS.

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:18.869
BEFORE WE SENTENCE THEM AARON TO

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:20.804
INCARCERATE THEM AND SO THAT'S

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:22.406
WHY WE ESTABLISH THE VETERANS

00:42:22.473 --> 00:42:23.140
COURT.

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:25.542
AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS IT IS

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:28.479
WORKING VERY VERY WELL.

00:42:28.545 --> 00:42:30.180
AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN A TERRIBLE

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:32.583
UPTICK IN THOSE VETERANS WHO

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.718
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:36.754
OF THE DIVERSIONARY COURT.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.856
IN THERE ARE. FIVE ONCE THEY

00:42:38.923 --> 00:42:41.492
HAVE BEEN GIVEN THIS OPTION AND

00:42:41.558 --> 00:42:43.894
HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TYPE ACOSTA

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:45.863
THE AVAILABLE TO THEM -- AND

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.065
CERTAINLY THESE DO YOU.

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:49.566
THE OTHER PART OF IT IS THAT IN

00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:52.836
A DIVERSION COURT IT IS THE THE

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:54.872
ENTITIES THAT ARE PART OF THAT

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:59.243
pSUCH THATDETERMINE THEN WHAT

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.211
ARE THE OPTIONS IF THE PERSON IS

00:43:01.278 --> 00:43:02.146
NOT INCARCERATED.

00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:04.148
SO DOES INCLUDE ELECTRONIC

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:06.016
MONITORING IS IT SUCH IS THE

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:08.152
WHAT OTHER TYPES OF SUPERVISION

00:43:08.218 --> 00:43:10.387
IS THE PERSON PUT IN IN ORDER TO

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:12.022
PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:14.091
AND SO WE'VE SEEN IT WORKED VERY

00:43:14.158 --> 00:43:15.559
WELL IN THE VETERANS

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:18.963
DIVERSIONARY COURT IN SO YES

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:20.764
THIS IS PATTERNED AFTER THAT.

00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:22.733
NOW TO THE QUESTION OF IF THE

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.500
PERSON.

00:43:23.567 --> 00:43:27.404
IS BREAKS ANY OF THE IF YOU KNOW

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:30.341
IF THEY VIOLATE ANY OF THE TERMS

00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:32.509
OF THE SUPERVISION.

00:43:32.576 --> 00:43:34.111
THEN YES THEY WOULD BE BROUGHT

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:36.046
BACK THAT IS ALSO PART OF THE

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:37.581
BILL IT IT THEY WOULDN'T THERE

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:39.450
THIS IS NOT A GET OUT OF JAIL

00:43:39.516 --> 00:43:41.418
FREE CARD.

00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:43.420
SO I HOPE THAT I ADDRESSED THE

00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:45.823
CONCERNS THAT ANY OF MY

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:47.191
COLLEAGUES MIGHT HAVE.

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:51.128
AND THIS IS THE SERIOUS FELONIES.

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:52.896
SERIOUS VIOLENT FELONY SUCH AS

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:54.064
MURDER AND RAPE AND OF COURSE

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:55.366
MANY OTHERS AND I DON'T MEAN

00:43:55.432 --> 00:43:57.134
ONLY TO BRING UP THOSE BECAUSE

00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:58.235
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE OTHER

00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:01.105
SERIOUS -- IN VIOLENT FELONIES

00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:03.107
THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE

00:44:03.173 --> 00:44:05.409
DEFENDANT BEING ABLE TO TAKE

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:06.844
ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:09.279
SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT TRYING

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:12.316
TO ENSURE THAT WE IF THERE IS A

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:15.519
CLEAR PATH. FOR A PERSONAGE

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:17.554
DEMONSTRATED THEIR

00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:18.922
REHABILITATIVE.

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:21.959
POTENTIAL AND WE CAN KEEP A

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:23.961
FAMILY FROM BEING SEPARATED AND

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:26.163
THUS A CHILD FROM GOING INTO

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:27.698
FOSTER CARE FOR EXAMPLE.

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:29.366
THIS IS ONE OPTION THAT WE MIGHT

00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:31.435
HAVE TO PURSUE AND WITH THAT I

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:35.372
ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB.

00:54:47.617 --> 00:54:49.719
PRIMARILY BECAUSE I THINK WE

CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS BILL.

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:04.707
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE A LOOK TO

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.375
WHAT MAKES OUR DEMOCRACY STRONG.

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:08.344
THE FOUNDATION OF ANY SUCCESSFUL

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:09.779
GOVERNMENT IS TRANSPARENCY.

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:11.380
TRANSPARENCY.

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:12.715
IN ANDIDLY.

IN OUR NATION'S DEMOCRACY.

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:26.262
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.197
REGARDLESS IF YOU'RE REPUBLICAN

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:29.999
REGARDLESS IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT.

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:32.301
