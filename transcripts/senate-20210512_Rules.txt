OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL JUMP RADIANT SO GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A FEW OPENING REMARKS BEFORE ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. BUT FIRST LIKE TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO pJOINING ME VIRTUALLY TODAY I'D LIKE TO THANK MY HUSBAND DAVE FOR SUPPORTING ME AND FOR ALL OF THE BIG AND SMALL WAYS HE TAKES CARE OF OUR FAMILY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY AMAZING DAUGHTERS KATIE MORIN WHO INSPIRED ME AND ENCOURAGED ME TO BE BRAVE AND CREATE A BETTER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR THEIR GENERATION. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOM IN SECRETARY GALLEY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN THIS ROLE AND TO DO WORK THAT IS MEANINGFUL. FINALLY I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LEADERS ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS THEIR TEAM I AM HONORED TO HAVE AN AMAZING LEADERSHIP TEAM SUPPORTING ME AND A WORLD CLASS TEAM OF OVER HOT FIVE HUNDRED STAFF THAT SHARE MY PASSION AND COMMITMENT TO ENSURING CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. I'M HUMBLED BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THEM AND COMMIT TO CREATING A CULTURE WHERE WE CELEBRATE AND EMBRACE OUR DIVERSITY ENCOURAGE CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION AND ALWAYS LOOK TO BETTER TO OPERATE WITH TRANSPARENCY AND HAVE HARD CONVERSATIONS WHEN WE NEED TO AND ALWAYS SEEK TO PUT CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE CONSUMERS AT THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING WE DO. I SPENT THE MONEY THIRTY OF MY CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE% WORKING ON PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS AND I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY HERE FROM CONSUMERS ACROSS THE STATE ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT AND LIFESAVING IT IS TO HAVE HEALTH COVERAGE BUT THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP. IT'S CRITICAL THAT CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THEIR COVERAGE WITHOUT BARRIERS OR DELAYED AND THIS IS AT THE CORE OF DMH SEES WORK AND A CRITICAL PART OF IMPROVING OVERALL HEALTH IN ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES. MY PRIORITIES FOR THE COMING YEAR INCLUDES OF SUPPORTING THE STATE'S RECOVERY FROM THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC ENSURING CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO NEEDED UNTIL LATE CARE ENSURING HEALTH PLAN ENROLLEES HAVE ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND LOOKING AT. HEALTHEQUITY IN EVERYTHING WE DO. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TO AND I LOOK OVER TO ANSWER YOUR- THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M GONNA GO AHEAD OF SENATOR LAYERED AND- ASK YOU TO KICK US OFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR- APPOINTMENT. TO THANK YOU FOR. YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE. I HAVE A- AND I APPRECIATED THE FACT THAT WE MET YESTERDAY MORNING AND I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS I THOUGHT WOULD BE GOOD TO. JUST TALK ABOUT IN PUBLIC THAT WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY AND ONE IS THAT. WITHIN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT IS REALLY MANAGING MANAGED MEDICAL CARE WHICH IS IN MANY CASES LOCAL. A NONPROFIT THAT TO DO DIFFERENT KINDS OF HANDS ON SERVICE. HE A. N. LOW OF JUST DIRECT PAYMENTS COULD YOU- JUST TALK ABOUT YOUR OFFICE AND- HOW WITH. OF LOOKS AT MANAGE MEDICAL CARE ENTITIES HOW THEY DEAL WITH THEM HOW YOU REGULATE THEM. YEAH NO I PUSHED THE OPPORTUNITY TALK TO YOU- YESTERDAY AS WELL- SO I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS SO THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE REGULATES ABOUT 96% OF COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT ENROLLMENT IN THE STATE- AND THIS INCLUDES REGULATING BOTH COMMERCIAL PLANS AS WELL AS THOSE THAT. RESPECT AND MEDICARE ALSO MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS- WE REGULATE PRIMARILY THE LOCAL INITIATIVES WE DO NOT HAVE REGULAR REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER THE COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEMS ALTHOUGH MANY OF THEM ARE- LICENSE WITH US FOR. OTHER PRODUCTS AND ONE IS VOLUNTARILY LICENSE- THE BUT YOU KNOW WE KIND OF HAVE A JEWEL REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OVER THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ALONG WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SO DH CS. HAS OVERSIGHT FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND A LOT OF REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY ADMINISTER THROUGH THEIR CONTRACT WITH THE PLANS. BUT OUR RULES THE REGULATOR- REALLY AS WE LICENSE THEM SO THEY HAVE TO MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY OTHER LICENSED PLAN SO WE HAVE BOTH FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT- WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPERATIONS ARE COMPLIANCE WITH THE KNOCKED COMPLY WITH THE KNOX KEEN ACT AND THEN OF COURSE THE CONSUMERS. I'M HAVE THE ABILITY TO COME TO OUR HELP CENTER AS WELL SO THAT'S KIND OF THE JEWEL REGULATORY STRUCTURE WE DO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR SISTER AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALIGNED IN OUR OVERSIGHT OF THE MEDICAL PLANS. AND ARE THERE EVER TIMES THAT YOU WISH TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS OR OBSERVATIONS. TO THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW. OF THERE MIGHT BE. THAT COULD BE DONE BETTER COMING OUT OF YOUR- OF THOSE. AGENCIES SURE- NO I MEAN WE ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE KEEPING THE LEGISLATURE IN OUR STAKEHOLDERS- INVOLVED INCLUDED IN OUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AS APPROPRIATE- I WOULD SAY THAT WE AT WE OBVIOUSLY WORKED% VERY CLOSELY WITH DH CS ON THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE- GENERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH BUT REALLY ARE. ARE OVERSIGHT IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE COMPLIANT WITH THE STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE IN THE BOX. OKAY WELL I THINK THAT'S JUST SOMETHING WE'RE SIGNALING ARE INTERESTED IN OVERTIME. AND THEN THE OTHER THING I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT WE HAD A VERY ANIMATED CONVERSATION ABOUT AND THIS IS WHERE I THINK I WOULD BE SPEAKING FOR THE CONSTITUENTS OF MANY PEOPLE HERE. OVER THE ISSUE. OF HEALTH PLANS THAT ENTER INTO CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS THAT GO RIGHT UP TO THE LAST DAY AND THEY SEND OUT LETTERS TO EVERYBODY IN THEIR AREA THAT. THEY MIGHT HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WONDER CARE MIGHT AND- A AND I DESCRIBE TO HAPPEN TO ME TWO YEARS AGO WHEN. WHEN I LEFT STATE EMPLOYMENT AND I HAD TO GET A NEW HEALTH PLAN. THE ONE I WANTED THEY WERE SENDING OUT LETTERS CYCLE IS GOING TO BE DISCONTINUED IN LOSS THIS HAPPENED I DID TAKE ONE I DIDN'T WANT BY THE TIME THE DEADLINE PASSED THE ONE I WANTED WOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY AGREED TO DAYS BEFORE. AND IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN REGULARLY. AND OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE THE HOSTAGES ARE. BECAUSE IT IS IT IS DEBATES BETWEEN. ARE EITHER HOSPITALS OR PLANS FOR. OUR HEALTH MULTI ARE COUNTY HEALTH SYSTEMS. AND WE TALKED ABOUT. YESTERDAY HOW THERE MIGHT B SOME OPTIONS AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF THE LEGISLATURE. WISH- OF KNOW HOW FAR YOU WANT TO GO AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT THING. FOR THOSE OF US BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING WE HEAR ABOUT ALL THE TIME AS OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE. HELD HOSTAGE IN THOSE SITUATIONS. SURE AND I FOR THE TO CHAT ABOUT IT YESTERDAY AS WELL AND SO REALLY WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN OUR ANY KIND OF OUR OVERSIGHT ROLES IS BLOCKED TRANSFER PROCESS AND SO THIS IS WHERE. WE IN ANY OTHER PROVIDER GROUP OR HOSPITAL- ARE TERMINATING A CONTRACT THIS IS OFTEN RELATED TO REIMBURSEMENT- CONTRACT DISPUTES. AND THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THE PROVIDER THAT HEALTH PLAN NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT AND FIND OUT WHAT WE CALL BLOCK TRANSFER FINALLY. WHEN MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND ROADWAYS ARE IMPACTED BY THIS CONTRACT TERMINATION. AND SO FOR PROVIDER GROUP TERMINATIONS I NEED TO NOTIFY A SEVENTY FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO THE TO THE TERMINATION HOSPITALS ARE THIRTY DAYS- AND THEN THERE'S A NOTIFICATION. ISSUED ITS REQUIRED TO GO TO CONSUMERS SIXTY DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE CONTRACT TERMINATION FOR PROVIDER GROUPS BUT FOR HOSPITALS AND I THINK THIS IS THE ONE THAT YOU REFERENCED- THE NOTIFICATION GOES OUT AFTER THE HOSPITAL TERMINATIONS HAPPENED. OUR ROLE- WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DICTATE WHAT. THE CONTRACT TERMS ARE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE OR REQUIRE PLANS TO CONDUCT A CERTAIN PROVIDER GROUPS HOSPITALS. BUT WE DO HAVE AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THAT THE PLANS HAVE AN ADEQUATE NETWORK OF PROVIDERS AND SO OUR REVIEW REALLY IS. WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT OF THE PROVIDER NETWORKING CONSUMERS IF THESE IF THIS CONTRACT TERMINATION HAPPENS- WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REVIEW THE NOTICES THAT GO TO CONSUMERS SO THAT THERE IS CLEAR AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN BE. BUT ALSO THAT CONSUMERS ARE AWARE OF THE THEIR RIGHT TO REQUEST CONTINUITY OF CARE TO CONTINUE SERVICES WITH THEIR THEIR CURRENT PROVIDER IN YES IT MEETS A CERTAIN CRITERIA- WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION. AND CONFUSION FOR CONSUMERS- I WILL TELL YOU THAT ABOUT 90% OF THESE CONTRACT TERMINATIONS AND UP RESOLVING THEMSELVES AND SOMETIMES SAYS AFTER THAT THE NOTICES HAVE GONE OUT TO CONSUMERS. IT CAN CREATE CONFUSION AND FRUSTRATION- AND THE UNKNOWN OBVIOUSLY OF WHETHER OR NOT A PARTICULAR PROVIDER WILL BE A NETWORK SO- AS WE DISCUSSED. YESTERDAY WE WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY YOU TO THINK ABOUT. SOLUTIONS LEGISLATURE ON ON SOME OF THOSE I KNOW WANT TO SEE TO ONE WE TALK YESTERDAY OF THIS SAME TO REQUIRE THAT SIX. RIGHT AT THE TIME OF AN OPEN ENROLLMENT- BEFORE SO PEOPLE WERE DISLOCATED THERE WERE DISLOCATED A TIME OF OPEN ENROLLMENT WHEN THEY COULD CHOOSE TO DO IT RATHER THAN JUST BE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME PERIOD AND EIGHT EVEN THOUGH THERE MIGHT BE A REQUIREMENT FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THE HOSTAGES USUALLY KNOW ABOUT IT. OR CLEAR ABOUT SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO EXPLORE IS WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT PHASED IN OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS AND IT IS ONE ANSWER TO IT SO ARE. YOU SURE. WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU AND THE ADMINISTRATION OVER TIME I KNOW YOU'RE NOT LAST CALL ON THAT. BUT JUST TO SEE IF THERE IS A SOLUTION THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PURSUE. THANK YOU KNOW WE WELCOME TO WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE AMOUNT. GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION. THANK YOU SENATOR I'M GONNA LEAVE THAT ON YOUR TO DO LIST TO WORK WITH US ON BECAUSE- I THINK THAT WAS THE REALLY CRITICAL QUESTION YOU ASK ON ALL OF OUR BY HOUSE AND I WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT TO ASK IT SO- AT THIS VERY RELEVANT TIME. SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN PUT THAT ON OUR TO DO LIST TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THAT PROCESS ANYTHING. SENATOR UP MEADOW VICE CHAIR FEEL. WELL THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS. IF I WANT TO MAKE SURE I STATUS ON WHAT. I CANNOT. OKAY YOU GOT IT GOT IT. A GREAT. ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND I'M LOOKING AT YOUR BIO AND I'M THINKING YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR A WHILE AND IT'S A VERY COMPLEX BUSINESS I COME FROM COUNTY GOVERNMENT WE HAVE CAL OPTIMA AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I EVER REALLY GOT MY HANDS AROUND. THE HOW IT ALL WORKS AND YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT TO US AS YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU DON'T OVERSEE BUT CERTAINLY IT IS A IT'S A BIG BIG COMPONENT OF THE DELIVERY OF OUR- HEALTHCARE AND ENSURING THAT CHAU CERTAINLY OUGHT IN THE EQUITY ISSUE. THAT TO OUR LOW INCOME AND VULNERABLE. HAVE ACCESS WHICH TAKES ME TO THE QUESTION O THE HEALTH EQUITY AND I KNOW- THE- BUDGET PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL ON HEALTHCARE IS TO CREATE A NEW HEALTH EQUITY AND QUALITY STANDARDS FOR HEALTH PLANS TO MEET. AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT. YOU KNOW FROM YOUR FIRST. SOME EXAMPLE OF WHAT WOULD BE THE AND QUALITY. THE MIGHT BE KIND. FOR THESE NEW STANDARDS THAT YOU ARE WELL VERSED ON GIVEN YOUR BACKGROUND ON. WHETHER THERE'S SUCH. A GREAT DIVIDE AT THE MOMENT SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO LOOK AT ALSO. SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT YOU KNOW JUST GO TO THE IT'S KIND OF A TWO PART. IF THEY'RE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR. A COST PRESSURE THAT COMES FROM. WHAT SEEMS TO BE A NOBLE- EFFORT THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BALANCE THAT WITH THE COST BECAUSE THAT PROBABLY IS A BIGGER ISSUE WITH ACCESS- IN TERMS OF WHAT PLANS OFFER SO. SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT HAVING. I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS ALL WEEK BUT MY SCHEDULE JUST CRIED. REALLY COMPRESS THIS WEEK AND I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO GET TO YOU OFF ON A ONE TO ONE THAT TIME HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO. SHARE WITH ME YOUR THOUGHTS. ON ALL OF THAT. JOURNALING AT I'VE BEEN WE CAN CHANCE TO MEET EITHER BUT WHAT TO FUTURE UP. SO ON THE HEALTH ACCORDING QUALITY PROPOSAL THAT THE GOAL HERE REALLY IS TO. NOT CREATE NEW MEASURES WE HAVE A LOT OF MEASURES THAT ARE ALREADY CURRENTLY COLLECTED ACROSS DIFFERENT PURCHASERS WHETHER IT'S DH CS COVER CALIFORNIA CALPERS WHICH I'M- REALLY KIND OF HONE IN AND REACH CONSENSUS AROUND TEN TO TWELVE CORE MEASURES. THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON AS A STATE TO IMPROVE QUALITY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HEALTH HEALTH EQUITY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. IMPROVING UTILIZATION AND THAT HEARINGS WITH- YOU KNOW. COMPL WITH CERTAIN SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AT THE EXPENSE OF LEAVING BEHIND OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- THE PANDEMIC IS REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON OUR ON OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND SO THE GOAL IS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHICH MEASURE SHOULD WE FOCUS ON. ON SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT WOULD BE THINGS LIKE DIABETES HEART DISEASE- COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING. IMMUNIZATIONS AND THOSE ARE JUST SOME EGGS AMPOULES WE REALLY WILL BE LOOKING TO THE COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS TO ADVISE US. ON ALONG WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS AND OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE WHAT SHOULD THOSE MEASURES SPEED- AND THEN THE GOAL WOULD BE TO SET BENCHMARKS OF WATER TO WE WANT OUR PLANS TO GET WITH THE FOCUS OF NOT LEAVING ANYBODY BEHIND- AND SO THAT WILL BE THE PROCESS THAT WE WILL GO THROUGH TO RECEIVE. OVER SERIES OF YEARS TO REALLY IDENTIFY THOSE BENCHMARKS WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL. OF WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY- REALLY BEING ABLE TO HOLD THE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO ACHIEVING THOSE MEASURES. DESIGNEE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS TO REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THESE MEASURES AND ULTIMATELY TAKING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS FINES AND PENALTIES IF THEY DON'T MEET THOSE BENCHMARKS. IN TERMS OF THE COST OF THE PLANS ARE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING AS BUT IN THE SECOND PART OF OUR MISSION B. SIDES ARE PROTECTING HEALTHCARE- PROTECTING HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS IS ENSURING A STABLE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS OF. THE COST OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS SOMETHING WE ARE ALWAYS VERY. OF ALONG WITH THE IMPACT OF THE PROVIDERS BECAUSE THE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CONSUMERS REALLY HOW WE IMPROVE. QUALITY I THINK THE COST WILL COME. IS IT BORDER. ACHIEVE AND- ON SOME OF THESE MEASURES. AND TO REACH MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND. THERE WILL NEED TO BE INTERVENTIONS AND SO THE PLANTS WILL REALLY NEED TO THINK CREATIVELY AND PROVIDERS COLLECTIVELY ABOUT WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE. ON WHETHER IT'S GETTING PEOPLE IN FOR VISITS MAKING SURE THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH THEIR RATE THE MEDICATION REQUIREMENTS- AND ANYTHING ELSE REALLY TO IMPROVE OVERALL QUALITY OF CARE- SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE COST WILL COME IN BUT IN THE LONG TERM IF WE CAN ADDRESS- PREVENTATIVE SERVICES AND LONG TERM COMPLIANCE WITH SOMETHING IS. REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURES I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE CAN SEE SOME COST SAVINGS IN THE FUTURE. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT TO VERY- COMPREHENSIVE ANSWER TO MY TWO PART QUESTION. WE ALWAYS GO TO THE REIMBURSABLE SAW FOR PROVIDERS. AND THAT'S WHAT SEEMS TO TAKE A HERE AT TWO IS WE GO FORWARD. THAT WE EXPAND ACCESS BUT NOT PROVIDERS. AND PROVIDERS TO DROP OUT BECAUSE OF THE REIMBURSABLE ISSUE AND- FRANKLY THAT GOES BACK TO I THINK WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND- WE HAD MANY PROVIDERS OUT SURROUNDING THE CAPITAL AND- I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS WERE ALL HERE AT THAT POINT. DRIVE FOR LIKE TWO THOUSAND THEY'RE DRESSED IN THEIR WHITE COATS DEMANDING. YOU KNOW AN INCREASE AT HAND THE REIMBURSABLE FIGHT THAT YEAR THEY- WE GOT SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET THIS IS A YEAR FRANKLY WITH A LITTLE MORE MONEY THAT I HOPE. THAT WILL HELP YOU DIRECTOR. AS YOU APPROACH THIS ON THIS PROPOSAL THERE IS MORE MONEY AND I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE. NOT WANTING TO GET INTO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION BECAUSE IT BECOMES COST- YOU KNOW NOT COST EFFECTIVE AND ACTUALLY THEY'RE PICKING UP ON A HUGE. YOU KNOW BURDEN THEMSELVES N BY PROVIDING CARE THAT IS NOT COVERED. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPACTFUL TOO. MANY PEOPLE THE NEW PROVIDERS ARE DOCTORS NURSES AT FEDERAL THAT COME INTO THE PROFESSION. AND FIND THEMSELVES BURDENED OUT COMING OUT OF THEIR VARIOUS MEDICAL SCHOOLS WITH A LARGE DOUBTS TOO AND NOW THEY HAVE. THE PLANS THAT ARE NOT PROVIDING COVERAGE FOR THE SERVICE OF THEIR GIVING AND I KNOW THAT. WEIGHS HEAVILY ON YOU TOO SO. I WISH YOU WELL AND I'M IMPRESSED WITH YOUR BACKGROUND I WILL ADMIT THAT I. GO BACK TO THE ORIGIN OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM I WAS A SOCIAL WORKER AT THAT TIME IT STARTED. FRANKLY IN MY UNIT BECAUSE I WAS. I HAD A TO THE DISABLED WHEN IT USED TO BE DIVIDED THAT WAY AND- MEDIC COUNTY MAN AND REALLY HELPED US WITH PROVIDING SERVICES TO OUR- OUR CASELOADS THAT WERE REALLY. YOU KNOW STRUGGLING AT THAT TIME TO GET. CARE OUTSIDE OF A COUNTY HOSPITAL. SO WITHOUT. AGAIN WISH YOU WELL. AND- HAVE A GREAT RESUME AND I HE THEY'LL DO A ONE JOB THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GROWTH. AND THANK YOU MADAM FIRST CONGRATULATIONS DIRECTOR ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND- I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY SAID YOU ARE VERY QUALIFIED FOR THIS POSITION I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN ADDRESSING IS WITH THE COKE IN NINETEEN- PANDEMIC RESPONSE. IT'S NEGATIVELY AFFECTED MANY PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH INCLUDING OUR CHILDREN THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION- PULL- SO THAT FOUR IN TEN ADULTS THE UNITED STATES HAVE REPORTED SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY DEPRESSIVE DISORDER AND NEXT TO THAT'S UP FROM ONE OF TEN AND ONE IN TEN. ADULTS PRE PANDEMIC AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN A SPIKE OF OVERDOSES DEATHS OVERDOSE DEATH BY 15% THAT'S UP 15% SO- WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE BECAUSE THE DISTRICT- MY CONSTITUENTS CALL CONTINUOUSLY ON THIS IS THE IMPACT THAT. THE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACT THAT THE RESPONSE FOR COLBERT NINETEEN IS HAD ON OUR CHILDREN I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE EMOTIONAL ISSUES- CHILDREN'S EMOTIONAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT THE RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC HAS CREATED BECAUSE OF SCHOOL CLOSURES AND IS THERE A PRIORITY TO EXAMINE. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- SERVICES FOR OUR USE I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON THE ADULT PORTION JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE YOUTH PORTION. BEFORE YOU A- GIVE ME A SECOND. I KNOW I CAN YOU HEAR. FRANKLY IT'S SOMEONE'S MICROPHONE ON A SOMEONE NOT MUTED OTHER THAN THE SPEAKER. IF EVERYONE MUTE'S THEMSELVES THAT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER FOR ME. RIGHT. OKAY SO I WILL ASK ANYONE THAT ISN'T SPEAKING- TO MUTE THEMSELVES INCLUDING- REMOTELY AND MAYBE THAT WILL HELP I COULD SEE THAT YOU WERE STRUGGLING TO HEAR SO- I DO PAY ATTENTION AND LET ME JUST ASK OUR MISS WATER NABI YOU HAVE THE QUESTIONS STILL IN MIND HI I'M SO SORRY I INTERRUPTED YOU SO LET'S SEE IF THIS IS BETTER EVERYONE MUTE UNLESS YOU ARE ACTUALLY SPEAKING AND- GO AHEAD WITH YOUR ANSWER AND AGAIN FORGIVE ME AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME INTERRUPT YOU. KNOW COURSE AS SOMEONE WHO FREQUENTLY FACILITATES MEETINGS YOU GOTTA MAKE SURE EVERYBODY CAN HEAR- AND I OF COURSE REFER THE QUESTION IT IS PROBABLY THE QUESTION THAT I THINK ABOUT DALY- I WILL SAY THAT- ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL SERVICES IS AT THE TOP OF MY LIST IN TERMS OF OUR PRIORITIES AND IT'S FOR US IT'S NOT JUST ADULTS BUT IT'S ALSO CHILDREN THAT TWENTY SIX MILLION CONSUMERS WHOSE- HEALTH CARE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO REGULATE- INCLUDES BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN- OBVIOUSLY THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC BOTH ON OUR ON OUR SOCIAL MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF A FOR CHILDREN BUT ALSO ADULTS VERY SIGNIFICANT- AS THE PARENT OF JOB TWO TEENAGERS- I AM DALY AWARE OF THE IMPACT OF WHAT THIS IS. IS DOING FOR OUR CHILDREN AND JUST THE ISOLATION- AND JUST GOING THROUGH A YEAR OF A PANDEMIC THAT WE'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED- I WILL SAY THAT- THERE'S A NUMBER OF STEPS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS TAKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ENSURING ACCESS TO BE HERE FOR A WHOLE SERVICES BOMB AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THE PARCHMENT. APPROVAL TO CONDUCT FOCUSED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INVESTIGATIONS OF THE TWENTY FIVE COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS TO REALLY DIG INTO WHERE THE ACCESS BARRIERS ARE WE HAVE A VERY STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH PARITY DEPARTMENT'S DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. OF WORK IN THE SPACE TO ENSURE THE I AM ARE COMPLYING WITH STRONG. AND PROTECTION. BUT- MY YOU ARE YOU HERE RIGHT. UP ACTS ISSUES AND BARRIERS TO CARE. AND WE REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND RIGHT TALKING TO CONSUMERS ABOUT WHERE THOSE BARRIERS ARE AND WHY IT'S JUST SO HARD TO GET BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES- IT MAY BE THAT THERE'S CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE EITHER REGULATORY STRUCTURE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE ORDER THIRSTING SUCH PARTNER CAN DO WITH OUR EXISTING AUTHORITY. WE ARE LOOKING FOR CONSUMERS OF VERY DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS- TO HELP US TO INFORM THOSE INVESTIGATIONS AND WHERE WE SHOULD MARK. THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON IS SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE AND THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT WERE MADE THERE ARE. JUST SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS PARTICULARLY AROUND THE USEOF CLINICAL GUIDELINES THE PLANTS NOW NEED TO USE. NONPROFIT CLINICAL GUIDELINES THAT ARE TRANSPARENT- BUT THERE'S NOT A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO ESTABLISH THOSE GUIDELINES. SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING- WITH WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND WITH THE HEALTH PLANS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB THIRTY FIVE. SO WE HAVE A LOT IN OUR TOOL KIT TO ENSURE ACCESS TO CARE- I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THAT WE ALSO HAVE A CONSUMER HELP CENTER THAT IS AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS. THAT NEED HELP. OR HAVE ANY CHALLENGES ACCESSING HERE WE WANT THEM TO CALL OUR CONSUMER HELP CENTER. WILL HELP THEM GET THE CARE THEY NEED. ALL OF THAT A- IT IS. ACUTELY TO BE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE- A GROW NEED WHEN WE SEND CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE FALL THERE WILL BE EVEN MORE OF A NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS. FROM HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON. DIFFERENT EFFORTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT AND THAT THE POTENTIAL WORKFORCE ISSUES AS WELL SO HOPEFULLY THAT WAS RESPONSIVE TO YOUR QUESTION. ABSOLUTELY MA'AM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT AND SINCE MY- TO ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES RT ASK THE OTHER TWO QUESTIONS I HAVE I WILL PASS IT ON. BACK TO THE SENATE PRO TEM. THANK YOU SENATOR GROWTH SENATOR COM LONGER. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM PRO TEM AND- CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AS WELL WE HAD A REALLY. GOOD DISCUSSION THE OTHER DAY AND SO- I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- MY COLLEAGUES DID ASK A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT- AND SO I JUST HAVE ONE FOR YOU- AND WANTED TO KNOW BECAUSE YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT A MANAGING COSTS AND MAKING SURE THAT. NOT ONLY ARE WE PROTECTING CONSUMERS BUT WE ARE WORKING TO- GET RID OF AS MANY BARRIERS AS POSSIBLE TO CARE AND I FEEL LIKE I'M SPEAK A LITTLE SLOWER NOW. BECAUSE I WANT TO BE SURE THAT ARE STILL MONGER FOR- CAN HERE- BUT I WANTED TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON. HEALTH CARE PLANS HAVING THE OPTION TO OBTAIN PHARMACEUTICALS ARE FROM COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES THIS HAS BEEN. A ROBUST CONVERSATION THAT SO MANY STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA I HAVE BEEN HAVING. IN FACT LAST YEAR I THINK THE GOVERNOR WAS INTERESTED IN FIGURING OUT A WAY THAT WE COULD GO AT IT ALONE- BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF PHARMACEUTICALS. SO I WANTED TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT- GIVEN COST CONTAINMENT AS SUCH- A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR SO MANY FOLKS IN THE HEALTHCARE. INDUSTRY NOT SURE NON AND I THINK YOU KNOW AS AS AS A DEPARTMENT THAT'S VERY FOCUSED ON PROTECTING CONSUMERS BUT ALSO JUST CONTROLLING COST THE COST OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS IT'S A VERY BIG ISSUE FOR US- RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW THEY HAVE A VERY STRONG OPINION I CAN STRESS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER ABOUT ACQUIRING PHARMACEUTICALS OUT OF THE COUNTRY I YOU KNOW I'D HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT FURTHER ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD. WOULD HELP TO CONTROL THE COST BUT I WOULD SAY THAT ANYTHING THAT WOULD HELP TO CONTROL THE COST FOR CONSUMERS IS SOMETHING THAT- I THINK WE ALL WOULD COLLECTIVELY PEACE. ORDER BOB THE DEPARTMENT HAS A NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE WE LOOK AT THE COST OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS EVERY YEAR-THE PLANT'S REPORT TO US ON THE DRUGS THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST COST HIGHEST INCREASING COSTS IN THE HIGHEST UTILIZATION WE ALSO LOOK AT HOW THAT. IMPACTS CONSUMER PREMIUMS AND SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREA WE ALSO CONVENED A TASK FORCE- LAST OR NEXT IS BY TWO YEARS AGO NOW AS A RESULT OF AB THREE FIFTEEN- TO HAVE A TASK FORCE RECOMMEND ARE THERE OTHER THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT AND SO I THINK THE MORE WE CAN BRING TRANSPARENCY TO. THE FLOW OF THE MONEY- WHO'S MAKING MONEY WHETHER OR NOT- PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS ARE WHAT THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN THE VALUE THAT THEY BRING SOUTH BEACH- I WOULD JUST SAY WE ARE VERY SUPPORT OF ANY OF ANY EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE COST OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS TO MAKE THEM WORK SYSTEM. OPPOSITE CONSUMERS. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I. HOPE AGREE- I JUST WANNA ADD I KNOW THAT. PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES AS- SORT OF MANAGING AND MONITORING- OFFICE CLOSURES AND HOPING THAT THEY DON'T HAPPEN WE KNOW THAT WE SAW A LOT OF THAT DURING COLD BIT. AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT IN MY DISTRICT WHICH- HAS BOTH HIGH INCOME AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WE SAW A DOUBLE DIGIT- IN OFFICE CLOSURES FOR SO MANY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOLKS OFFERING SERVICES TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO LGBTQ COMMUNITIES- AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT MOST DESERVE- EQUITY WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS HAVE ACCESS TO CARE ON THAT IS AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY AND NON DISCRIMINATORY. SO I KNOW THAT MAYBE NOT ALL OF THAT LIKE THAT BUT I KNOW THAT ALL OF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- YOU ALL SORT OF STRIVE TO ACHIEVE- AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER THE LEGISLATURE. A PARTNER- IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN- TO ENSURE THAT PROVIDERS ARE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE TO ALL OF CALIFORNIANS. DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT I THINK IT WAS MORE OF A STATEMENT BUT ONLY GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO. HE HAD NO I WILL I THINK IT'S A REALLY IT'S A IT'S A GOOD POINT IN SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WE ARE MONITORING VERY CLOSELY WE ACTUALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC ISSUED- AND ALL PLAN WATER AT THE END OF LAST YEAR REQUIRING PLANS TO TELL US ABOUT. I'M PRACTICES THAT HAVE HAD A DECREASE IN UTILIZATION OR OR REIMBURSEMENT OF MORE THAN 25% AS WELL AS OFFICE CLOSURES I'M MORE PRACTICES THAT WERE SOLD SO WE'RE KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS THE PLANS ARE CONTINUING TO FILE THAT WITH US- SO WORK WE'RE MONITORING VERY CLOSELY ABOUT THE IMPACT PROVIDERS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AS WE RETURN TO. WHATEVER DO NORMAL WILL LOOK LIKE THAT CONSUMERS CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO A ROBUST NETWORK OF PROVIDERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALL HUNDRED COUNCIL VERITY AND I'M A RECENT APPOINTEES SERVING JUST OVER SIX MONTHS TO DATE. HAVING BEEN BORN AND RAISED IN LOS ANGELES BY AN IMMIGRANT SINGLE MOTHER FROM MEXICO AND EXPERIENCE HEALTHCARE FROM EVERY ANGLE AS A CHILD ON MEDIC HOW AS A WHITE HOUSE AIDE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN THEY AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS PASSED. AND IN WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE MY MOST RELEVANT PERSPECTIVE AS A PATIENT THE CATALYST FOR MY WORK AS A WOMEN'S HEALTH ADVOCATE CAME AT A VERY YOUNG AGE BREAST CANCER IS BEEN A CONSTANT DRUMBEAT IN MY LIFE DUE TO A HEREDITARY CANCER MUTATION THAT RUNS IN MY FAMILY. ROCKA MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER LOST THEIR LIVES TO DISEASE AND MY MOTHER AND TWO AUNTS HAVE ALSO BATTLED BREAST CANCER AS A BROAD COMMUNICATION CARRIER NOW MYSELF AS WELL AS BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR. I HAVE EXPERIENCE FIRST HAND HOW VULNERABLE PATIENTS ARE WHEN ENGAGING WITH THE MEDICAL SYSTEM AND THE VITAL ROLE THAT TRUST PLAYS IN THE PROCESS. THESE EXPERIENCES IN THE COUNTLESS PATIENTS I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO KNOW AND WORK WITH CATALYSE MY ADVOCACY PARTICULARLY ORIENTED TOWARDS INCREASING ACCESS IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES LAST YEAR I PRODUCE A HELP DOCUMENTARY INHERITANCE WHICH AIRED ON PBS. AND INTIMATELY FOLLOWS A SURGICAL JOURNEYS THREE WOMEN I'VE HOSTED HELP SUMMITS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS FOR YOUNG WOMEN OF COLOR IN LOS ANGELES AND I PARTNERED WITH PENN MEDICINE TO LAUNCH A COMPREHENSIVE INITIATIVE RAISING AWARENESS AND PROVIDING SPANISH LANGUAGE RESOURCES. THE LAST NEXT COMMUNITY. MY PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND WORKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND AS AN EXECUTIVE IN VARIOUS MEDIA COMPANIES I SERVED A FULL FURTHER ILLUSTRATE HOW CRITICAL CLEAR COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC IS AS WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HISPANIC MEDIA MY ROLE WAS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A COMMUNICATION STRATEGY. THAT WAS TRANSPARENT AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT. I CONSIDER THIS TO BE AN AREA WHERE I CAN PARTICULARLY CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASING OUR REGION ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD AND TO THAT END I AM ENTHUSIASTIC TO LOOK FOR NEW WAYS TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE THE PUBLIC. I TAKE MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A PUBLIC. MEMBER VERY SERIOUSLY THERE AS WELL REASON ALONE THAT I AM SHE AND I IS PUBLIC. LASTLY ON A- NOW. I'M THINKING OF MY GRANDPARENTS TODAY WHO DIED FAR TOO YOUNG WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IT'S IN THEIR MEMORY THAT I PASSIONATELY ADVOCATE FOR COMPREHENSIVE PATIENT PROTECTION. I WANT TO THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOM FOR POINTING ME TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IN THIS CAPACITY I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERFORM THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR pVERY MUCH. LET'S GO TO DOCTOR HAWKINS NEXT WELCOME. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF MY REAPPOINTMENT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA I WANT TO THANK GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM FOR STRESS AND REAPPOINT ME TO THE BOARD. I'VE BEEN IN PRIVATE PRACTICE IN ENGLAND CALIFORNIA FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. I PROVIDE OSTLY PRIMARY CARE BUT A LONG SPECIALIST AND INVOLVED IN IN THE BLACK CARE A WIFE CAL AS A PRACTICING PRODUCTIVE BUSINESS INSTANT TWO ADULT CHILDREN. I FAMILIES SUPPORTER OF MY WORK AS A POSITION AS A PUBLIC SERVANT. ALSO TO THANK THE PUBLIC WHO COMES BEFORE THE BOARD TO ENSURE THAT THE WORK OF THE BOARD IS PROTECTIVE OF THEM. THE MEDICAL BOARD'S MISSION IS PUBLIC PROTECTION. ALL OF MY DECISIONS OUR THROUGH THE LENS OF PROTECT THE PUBLIC. I HAVE TWO KEY GOALS FOR MY NEXT TERM ON THE MEDICAL BOARD. FOR SOMEONE APPROVED TRANSPARENCY TRUST AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE BOARD THE PUBLIC WE SERVE. I FEEL THAT THE BOARD'S QUARTERLY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND THE PUBLIC OUTREACH EDUCATION WELLNESS COMMITTEE WILL BE ESSENTIAL CATALYST AND CONDIMENTS. WE HAVE WORK TO DO BUT I FEEL WITH FOCUS DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT WE WILL SUCCEED IN BUILDING TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY. SECONDLY I PLAN TO PURSUE ENGAGE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS HE TRAINING PROGRAMS. TO DISCUSS WHAT AN HONOR IT IS TO BE A PHYSICIAN AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HOLDING OURSELVES AS DOCTORS TO A HIGHER LEVEL ETHICS. PROFESSIONALISM I BELIEVE THIS CAN CREATE BETTER INFORMED AND MORE COMPASSIONATE PHYSICIANS. THE MEDICAL PROFESSION AFFORDS PRACTITIONERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO OTHERS OFTEN DOING EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TIMES IT'S AN HONOR TO PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE TO THE CALIFORNIA CITIZENS THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE YOU HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU DOCTOR HAWKINS AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST AND THANKING HER FOR HER PATIENCE SALAMI OUT WELCOME LAURIE ROSE LUCIANO WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM PRO TEM AND MEMBERS OF THE RULES COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LAURIE FRESNO BEE ON L. AND I'VE BEEN SERVING AS A PUBLIC MEMBER SINCE JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND AS THE YOUNGEST AND ONE OF THREE WOMEN ON THE MEDICAL BOARD I'M TRULY HONORED FOR IT JUST PRIVILEGE TO SERVE AN OFFER MY DIVERSE PERSPECTIVE. AND THAT DIVERSE PERSPECTIVE IS BUILT ON A MULTITUDE OF THINGS ONE I BRING TO THE TABLE THIRTEEN YEARS AS AT BEING A AN ATTORNEY. LICENSED IN THE STATE SPECIALIZING IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IN THE TECHNOLOGY SPACE AS WELL AS I BRING THE SKILLS OF CONSENSUS AND RELATIONSHIP BUILDING I'M DOING MY WORK ON THE COMMITTEE IN WITH THE COMMUNITY ON THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVELS. AND LASTLY AS PART OF THAT PERSPECTIVE- I'M A PARENT OF TWO YOUNG CHILDREN AND ALSO- PERSPECTIVE AS A SECOND GENERATION IMMIGRANT FROM A FAMILY THAT EMIGRATED HERE FROM THE PHILIPPINES TO SAN FRANCISCO IN THE EARLY. NINETEEN SEVENTIES. AND OVERALL I'VE WITNESSED FIRST HAND THE IMPORTANCE AND IMPACT OF THE WORK THAT WE DO AT THE MEDICAL BOARD AND- I KNOW IT IT'S DIFFICULT AND BUT I FIND IT GRATIFYING AND WORTHWHILE. AND QUITE HONESTLY THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT DRIVE ME TO DO THIS AND OTHER THINGS THAT AND THOSE TWO THINGS ARE ONE IS I TRULY BELIEVE THAT- IT ONE IT'S ONE OF MY JOBS TO BRING MY TALENTS AND EXPERIENCE AND BE A BLESSING TO OTHERS. AND TO I FEEL THAT- I'M DRIVEN TO LEAVE WHAT I HIKES EVERYTHING SUCH BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE. AND SO WHEN I INITIALLY CAME HERE I SET GOALS FOR MYSELF FOR MYSELF US SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO OUT REACH AND IF CONFIRMED UP I HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK. TOWARDS THOSE GOALS FOR SPECIFICALLY TO YOU ON ON THE COMMITTEE OF OUTREACH AND WELLNESS AND EDUCATION. AND BRING SOME OF THE IDEAS I HAVE TO LIFE. AND ALSO- YOU KNOW WE RESPECT OUR AND FOR. PROGRAM YOU OFFER THE INSIGHT AND GUIDANCE TO ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE PROTECTION FOR THE PUBLIC IS GREATER AND PROMPT. AND SO I WOULD BE TRULY HONORED TO CONTINUE THIS WORK AND WHAT WE'LL DO SO HUMBLY. AND WITH ALL THE INTEGRITY THAT THE APPOINTMENT DEMANDS AND LASTED LIKE TO THANK. MY FAMILY FOR ALL THEIR LOVE AND SUPPORT I THANK YOU THIS WITHOUT THEM AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR WHO SEND AND THE VILLAGE OF CHEERLEADERS AND SUPPORTERS ALONG THE WAY WHO HAVE ESSENTIALLY LISTED NEED TO WHERE. I AM TODAY SO THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M GONNA START US SENATOR COME LONGER WITH YOU AT THIS POINT AND- LET ME ASK IF MY COLLEAGUES- IF YOU. DIRECT YOUR QUESTION TO A PARTICULAR- BOARD MEMBER WOULD BE HELPFUL IF IT IS A QUESTION TO EACH OF THEM. THEN I WILL FACILITATE WHO GOES FIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH JUST SO THAT WE KEEP IT ORGANIZED- AND WERE HELPFUL TO THE COURT REPORTER- AS WE FACILITATE THIS SO SENATOR COBBLER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRO TEM UM I'M THINK I'M GOING TO DIRECT. THIS QUESTION TO DOCTOR HAWKINS I- AND MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE HE ALSO IS A CONSTITUENT NOW JOKING- BUT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU ALL FOR GIVING ME SOME TIME TO- MEET WITH YOU THE OTHER DAY I THINK I SORT OF CHARACTERIZED- THE MEDICAL BOARD AFTER READING UP ON IT AS- A LITTLE BIT OF A HOT MESS. AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T DEFAMATORY AGAINST ANY OF YOU ALL AT ALL BUT PROBABLY MORE OF A CHARACTERIZATION OF THE WORK THAT IS AHEAD OF YOU MOSTLY BECAUSE I THINK IN EACH OF YOUR RESPONSES TO- THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU WERE ASKED. YOU ALL REFERENCED GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND WORKING TO BUILD BACK THE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC AND I THINK BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- BUT ALSO PRETTY DAUNTING. AND MY FIRST QUESTION ACTUALLY- HAS TO DO WITH- IMPLICIT BIAS AND SORT OF RACIAL DISPARITIES- IN TERMS OF THE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS THAT ARE TAKEN AGAINST THE DOCTORS AND SO I'M GOING TO ASK DOCTOR HOPKINS MOSTLY BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING UP FOR REAPPOINTMENT- AND PROBABLY HAVE A GREATER EXPERIENCE WITH THIS THEN THE OTHER THREE- PUBLIC MEMBERS. OF COURSE IF THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO IT PLEASE FEEL FREE- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS IMPLICIT BIAS EVERYWHERE- INCLUDING IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY- AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT. THE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS- THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN HAVE BEEN- DISPROPORTIONATELY AGAINST BLACK IN LATIN X. PHYSICIANS- AND SO JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK THE MEDICAL BOARD CAN DO- TO IMPACT OUR COMBAT IMPLICIT BIAS- BOTH IN TERMS OF HOW PHYSICIANS AND PHYSICIANS OF COLOR ARE TREATED BUT ALSO COMPLAINS- BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER OF CREATING BALANCE ON BOTH SIDES. OF THAT EQUATION- BUT I THINK IT ALSO SORT OF SUBTLY SPEAKS TO THE LACK OF TRUST THAT HAS GROWN- FROM BY THE PUBLIC IN TERMS OF HOW THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS RESPONDED. TO A NUMBER OF THE COMPLAINTS ND INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE COME YOUR WAY. THANK YOU REVEREND HAWKINS GO AHEAD I'M SORRY TO ME TO INTERRUPT DR HAWKINS GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SO. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE- DEMOGRAPHIC AFTER STUDYING A CURRENT RISEN BECAUSE OF COLLEAGUES OF MINE AND YOU KNOW THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY WHO FELT THAT THERE WAS DISPROPORTIONATE. DISCIPLINE AGAINST THIS IS AN AFTERNOON AMERICAN PREDOMINATELY ORGANIZATION THIS ORGANIZATION BUT ANYONE IS WELCOME TO JOIN- AND SO WE'RE ABLE TO GET OUR- THE CARD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ALONG WITH OTHERS TO ACTUALLY COMMISSION THIS THIS PROGRAM. AND SO THIS WAS VERY VERY INFORMATIVE AND INFORMATION THAT WAS SUSPECTED BUT DID NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE TRUE WHICH IS THAT THERE WAS A DISPROPORTION COMPLAINTS AGAINST CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS CERTAIN GROUPS. AFTER AMERICANS. LANCER NEXT SURNAME INDIVIDUALS AND THAT THERE WAS DISPROPORTION DISCIPLINE AS WELL- HI THIS CAME ABOUT BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO BACK. MANY YEARS. HE COULD TALK TO PHYSICIANS THAT LOOK LIKE ME AND THEY WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THE MEDICAL BOARD'S ALWAYS ON ME THAT YOU KNOW DOCTOR SO AND SO JUST GOT DISCIPLINE AND ALL THESE SORTS OF THINGS OUT SO WE HAD TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF. THE SCOPE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SO WITH LIMITED AT THE TIME WE CAN GET INFORMATION AND I'VE MENTIONED THE OUTCOME OF THAT. WHAT TWO THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED. IS THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THESE FINDINGS- IMPLICIT IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING- IS PROVIDED TO. ALL MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL BOARD EVERY TWO YEARS. AND IS OUR RECOMMENDATION ALL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. GO THROUGH THIS SO THIS IS VERY INFORMATIVE. FOUR THE MEMBERS. AS A RESULT OF THE- RESULT OF THE STUDY. IN ADDITION. WE REDACTED. NONESSENTIAL INFORMATION THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO BIAS FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE INDIVIDUALS WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL WHERE THE RESCU TRAINING. WOULD BE. WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MAY SUB CONSCIOUSLY OR CONSCIOUSLY. BELIEVE THAT A PERSON WENT TO. AN ELITE INSTITUTION. BUT I CAN'T BE AS GOOD AS A COMMUNITY. INSTITUTION AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THINGS WE ALSO DID. SO THOSE TWO THINGS ARE ACTUALLY BEEN. HELPFUL BUT IT DOES NOT. GET RID OF. THE PROBLEM OF BIAS SO MY COLLEAGUES FEEL THAT- THIS PROM IS TO RAISE- I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TO. DRILL DOWN ON LOOKING AT THE NEXT STEP THE NEXT PHASE AND TO ACTUALLY CREATE A STUDY. THAT ANSWERS SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED I THINK THAT SOME OF THE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS. THAT WE VIEW THIS AS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I DO I'M ONE OF THOSE. NEED TO COME BEFORE THE MEDICAL BOARD AND SPEAK OUT THEY NEED TO- GET ON AGENDA. WE WILL. SET UP MEETINGS WHERE THEY'LL BE THE SUBJECT. OF DISCUSSION AND TALK TO US ABOUT YOUR OBSERVATIONS YOUR CONCERNS OR SUGGESTIONS TO BE INCLUSIVE. IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU- THIS QUESTION ACTUALLY IS FOR MISS LUCIANO AND WE HAD- VERY NICE DISCUSSION- I BELIEVE IT WAS YESTERDAY AND I WE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT I MENTIONED THAT I WAS GOING TO BRING THIS UP TO YOU SO- I. WANTED TO SORT OF QUEUE THAT UP- AND THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO A NUMBER OF SOME COMMENTS THAT YOU HAD MADE OUT OF SOME TIME AGO. AS IT RELATES TO OUR VACCINES- AND I BELIEVE IT WAS S. B. TWO SEVEN SIX AND- SO JUST WANTED TO. ASK YOU TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT- TO THE STATEMENTS- THAT YOU MADE- AND SO THE QUESTION THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT IS. YOU KNOW HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BALANCE- THE STANDARD OF CARE THAT MAINTAINS OUR HOW CRITICAL IT IS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH- FOR VACCINES AND VACCINATIONS- WITH SOME PARENTS THIS BEER- THAT THEY COULD HARM- CHILDREN. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THAT QUESTION AND ABILITY TO ADD SOME SOME CONTACTS AND- WAS THE FIRST IT JUST TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO CONFUSION- I BELIEVE IN THE EFFICACY OF VACCINES IT AND THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT. AND A FEW YEARS AGO WE- WE HAD A BOARD MEETING AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT VACCINES IN THAT CONTEXT AND I HAD MADE A STATEMENT AND MIND YOU IT WAS. MY SECOND BOARD MEETING SO I WAS STILL LEARNING THE ROPES THERE- AND I MADE A COMMENT WITH RESPECT- TO A CONSIDERING THAT. YOU KNOW. HERE MEDICAL HISTORY OR GENETIC HISTORY OR ACTUAL THAT VACCINE INJURY IN PATIENTS AND THAT WAS REALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE MANY PARENTS WHO WEAR THEIR WHO ARE EXPRESSING. THAT THEY'VE HAD CHILDREN WITH WITH VACCINE- INJURY AND THEIR CONCERN AROUND THAT ISSUE AND SO THAT AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT IT WAS- BUT WITH RESPECT TO- HOW WE WOULD LOOK AT IT FROM A BOARD- ABOUT. VACCINES AND HOW I RELATES AT IT TO PATIENTS IS THAT YOU DON'T. WHEN IT WHEN AND IF IT COMES BEFORE US WE ALSO HAVE A DUTY TO LOOK AT THE LAW AND WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT FOR OUR PHYSICIANS THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING- YOU KNOW THE STANDARDS CARE WITH RESPECT TO EXEMPTIONS THAT. PAYMENT BE MADE RIGHT FOR VACCINES AND SO THAT'S HOW I WOULD THINK ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT TONIGHT JUST MADAM CHAIR HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION THEN I GUESS I WILL DIRECT THIS TO. MISTER BROOKS AND MISS CAMP VERDE RECOGNIZING THAT BOTH OF YOU WILL BE NEW TO THIS BOARD- BUT BOTH OF YOU SPOKE ABOUT- CONSUMER PROTECTIONS- YOU BOTH TALKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW BEING MAYBE THE FIRST OR NOT SEEING FOLKS THAT LOOK LIKE YOU AND REALLY SORT OF CARRYING IN YOUR HISTORY IS WITH YOU ON TO THIS BOARD- THE BOARD IS ALSO CONTEMPLATING A FEE INCREASE- SO WE HAVE A FEE INCREASE ON THE ONE HAND. THAT'S BEING PROPOSED. WITH OF MEDICAL BOARD I THINK THAT'S RANKED. ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS THIRTY THREE- IN THE NATION- AND THAT HAS BEEN STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY RIGHT WITH OPERATING DEFICITS. COUPLED WITH A VERY I GUESS ARE KEEN SORT OF SYSTEM WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY AND THE TIME IS ACTUALLY SPENT ON INVESTIGATIONS- THAT MAYBE YOU ALL DON'T HAVE- YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE NOT WITH HANDS ON WITH. AND ALL OF THESE THINGS I THINK ARE PART OF. THE COMPLEXITIES OF BUILDING TRUST. WITH THE PUBLIC. AND SO- WHILE I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION ON THE FEE INCREASE AND SOME FOLKS THINK THAT THINK IT IS IMPORTANT JUST WANTED TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS AND SORT OF FRESH EYES TO THE BOARD- IN THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT YOU WILL HAVE AS BOARD MEMBERS. ON HOW YOU WILL MANAGE THROUGH THOSE COMPETING ISSUES RIGHT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A BOARD THAT IS A FISCALLY- MAYBE NOT PRUDENT BUT AT LEAST MANAGING COSTS IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR CALIFORNIANS. WITH LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT TAKES TO INVESTIGATE THESE CASES. SO THAT PEOPLE FEEL LESS OUT REACHED. WHEN YOU'RE PROPOSING FEE INCREASES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY- DISSUADE NEW pWANTING TO ENTER INTO THE FIELD BECAUSE FOLKS FEEL LIKE I'M GIVING SO MUCH AND NOT GETTING AS MUCH IN RETURN SO WOULD LOVE TO KNOW YOUR- TO BRIEF THOUGHTS ON HOW YOU PLAN TO. ADDRESS OR GUIDE THE BOARD- THROUGH THOSE VERY MANY MATT LAND MINES- AS IT RELATES TO SORT OF HAVING A MORE EFFICIENTLY- OPERATING BOARD- THAT'S BUILDING TRUST MISTER BROOKS WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST AND THEN MISCONDUCT HERE TO YOU CAN FOLLOW HIM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ALSO FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MEET WITH US- YOU KNOW THAT I DID WAS APPOINTED ON FEBRUARY THE SECOND SO I HAVE NOT ATTENDED A BOARD MEETING YES- BUT I CAN GIVE YOU KIND OF MY OLD AROUND. BUT BACKGROUND ON THREE INCREASES IN GENERAL AND I WILL BE IN COURSES SHOULD BE ONLY ENTERTAIN THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. DOES THE INCREASE ALL THROUGH THE MISSION. DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT COST SAVINGS IS DONE IN A CLASSROOM AT MANOR. WILL PUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS. AND WE SHOULD AGREE THAT CAN YOU FEEL INCREASES SHOULD BE A RARE. THE ONE THING THAT. WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE STAND EVERY DOC. IS AND A SENIOR. COULD BE SEEN AS A REQUEST. SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE TAKE THESE INCREASES SERIOUSLY. THE OLDER DRESSES HOW I WOULD PROCESS THEY INCREASE THE NUMBER TWO WE TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC PARTY OR JUST A PRETTY CERTAIN WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB. IT UP FORTUNATE THAT I HAD. BEEN ON THE DISEASE YOU SEE A FAMILY FOR TWELVE YEARS OR BOARD OF PHARMACY. AND THERE ARE JOB WHAT TO DO BOYS TO THOSE PUBLIC MEMBERS WHO DIDN'T HAVE A VOICE WE HAVE A BOAT. BE HEARD AND LISTEN TO. AND I WILL TAKE THAT SAME PROCESS. WOULD BE TO THE MEDICAL MORE. THANK YOU. GO AHEAD MS COMPARED A- THANK YOU IN ADDITION TO MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS ON THE FEE INCREASE ACTUALLY WANT TO ADDRESS TWO OTHER PIECES WHICH ARE THE FACT THAT I AM HEARTENED BY THE FACT THAT WE JUST SIGNED AN MOU WITH EACH YOU WHY YOU IN ORDER TO SHORTEN OUR TIME FRAMES AND STREAMLINED OUR PROCESS AS FAR AS INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE SENATOR TO YOUR POINT THERE SO MANY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S A FEET USE WHICH WE HAVE INCREASED OUR FEET IN FIFTEEN YEARS BUT I AM CERTAINLY MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT THESE COSTS ARE ARE ARE BURDENS ESPECIALLY ON DOCTORS OF COLOR WHO MAY NOT. HAVE THE SAME NEEDS AS THEIR COLLEAGUES AND SO BEING ABLE TO STREAMLINE OUR PROCESS AND ON THE OTHER HAND AS WELL AS WILL INCREASE OUR COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC I THINK ALL THOSE THINGS OPERATING IN TANDEM WILL DO WHAT IT IS YOU'RE SAYING AND START TO REESTABLISH TRUST AT THE LEVEL OF THE PUBLIC DESERVES AND WE HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL AS MEDICAL OR TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC IN RIGHT WHERE THEY ARE AND IN IN A CULTURALLY COMPETENT WAY IN A WAY THAT RESPECTS THE FACT THAT IT IS A COMPLICATED PROCESS AND WE SHOULD DO A BETTER JOB AT EXPLAINING IT. SO THAT. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BEHIND THE CURTAIN. THANK YOU. ALL AND- LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING- YOUR APPOINTMENTS AND APPRECIATE THE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM UM. MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES IS QUESTIONS- THE WERE SIMILAR IN LINE TO WHAT I HAD TO ASK- FIRST OF ALL WHEN WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO THIS- CONFIRMATION HEARING AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE ON THIS- THE BOARD. AS I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE ENFORCEMENT MODEL HISTORICALLY USED- IT THE- THE BOARD USED TO HAND OFF METHOD- ENFORCEMENT MODEL SIMILAR TO. OTHER ENTITIES WITH AS THE DCA DEBT YOU KNOW DEPUTY ATTORNEY- BUT THE DCA- THE HANDOFF MODEL WAS- ADJUSTED TO A VERTICAL MODEL I BELIEVE IS WHAT IT WAS CALLED. FOR VERTICAL ENFORCEMENT MODEL IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE- I THINK SB TWO THIRTY ONE FIGARO WAS REQUIRED THE BOARD TO IMPLEMENT ALTERNATIVE MODELS TO. TO MINIMIZE THE LENGTH OF TIME INVESTIGATIONS WERE TAKING PLACE I BELIEVE EVERYONE YOU KNOW UP TO NINE HUNDRED DAYS AND THE GOAL OF THE BOARD WAS FIVE HUNDRED FORTY DAYS TO RESOLVE CASES. SO- YOU KNOW. WITH THE FAMILY- THAT HAD A COMPLAINT OR A COMPLAINT WAS ISSUED. AND THEY HAD TO WAIT THREE YEARS ON A DECISION- I THINK THAT'S WHERE. THE ISSUE LIES WITH THE PUBLIC OPPOSITION. IS THAT NOT HAVING THE PROCESS. IN A MORE EXPEDITED FASHION BUT I DO ALSO KNOW THAT THERE HAS TO BE COMPLETE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT- THE JUSTICE SYSTEM YOU KNOW JUSTICE IS THERE. AND THE COMPLETE INVESTIGATION THE TRUTH CAN BE TOLD. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND I'M AND ADDRESSING IT TO DOCTOR HAWKINS I GUESS BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ON THE BOARD- BEORE OUR ANY OTHER OF THE BOARD MEMBERS THE DIRECTORS WOULD LIKE TO READ A REPLY. AND THAT'S AS WELL WELL I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR COMMENTS. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT MEASURES IF ANY CAN BE TAKEN TO STREAMLINE OTHERWISE IMPROVE THE BOARD'S ENFORCEMENT PROCESS BECAUSE AGAIN. WE ARE BACK WITH SENATOR HILLS BILL SB SEVEN NINETY EIGHT- THAT STOP THE VERTICAL- ENFORCEMENT PROCESS BECAUSE-OBVIOUSLY IT ADDED TIME TO THE INVESTIGATION. SO WHAT DID ANY OF YOU SEE IN THE FUTURE TO MAKE. AT A SOME MORE STREAMLINED PROCESS IN THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS. SO THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE ISSUES OR COMPLAINTS WITH THE BOARD WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE. RESOLUTION QUICKER. I THINK ABOUT FAMILIES THAT MAY HAVE HAD- AN UNEXPECTED FATALITY LET'S JUST SAY THAT AN UNEXPECTED TO FATALITY OR AN UNEXPECTED SITUATION. THAT CAUSED A MAJOR MEDICAL ISSUE WITH A FAMILY MEMBER OR LOVED ONE. AND THEY CARRY THAT BURDEN AND THAT FIGHT FOR THREE YEARS UNTIL THE BOARD CAN RESOLVE- THE ISSUE SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS ON BEHALF OF THE CONSTITUENTS THAT WE ALL REPRESENT. IS THERE A STREAMLINED PROCESS THAT ALL OF YOU ARE- LOOKING AT. SO THAT. IT CAN BE INVESTIGATED THOROUGHLY. AND WE DON'T CUT ANY CORNERS BUT THAT IT TAKES LESS THAN THREE YEARS TO DO. AND WHAT WE START WITH UGH AS THE SENATOR INDICATED DR HAWKINS AND THEN I WILL SEE WHO ELSE WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THAT IF THAT IS OKAYYES DOCTOR HAWKINS GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WOULD. BUSINESS SAY THAT THE NUMBER SO SATISFIED WITH SOME OF THOSE TIME LINES FOR THE MOST EXTREME CASES SUMMER. CLOSE SOONER BUT WE'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THREE YEARS TAKES CLOSE A CASE. YOU TOUCHED ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WILL GRAPPLE WITH ALL THE TIME. THESE ARE COMPLICATED CASES- THAT REQUIRE. DUE PROCESS THE REQUIRE A HIGHER LEVEL OF BURDEN OF PROOF- ACTUALLY THE CLEAR AND CONVINCING WHICH IS NOT THE SAME AS SOME OF THESTATES FROM WHICH THE STATISTICS CAME FROM. THERE WERE TOLD ABOUT THAT THE RAIDERS KINDA LOW AMONG THE- THE- STATES IN TERMS OF MEDICAL BOARDS- BUT- AND I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SEEM THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE CHANGES WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE CHANGES IN. THIS CONTROVERSY MENTIONED THE MEMBER UNDERSTANDING WHERE. WE HOPE TO STREAMLINE. THIS A MEMBER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN DCA IS EXTRA YOU IT FOR YOUR THE INVESTIGATIVE ARM BUT THE BOARD- AND SHOULD WE SPEND 80% OF OUR FUNDS UNDER FORCING. ON PUBLIC PROTECTION FORCES- NEED TO BE BALANCING THAT WITH- THE COMMUNICATION INCLUSION WITH PUBLIC- SO THESE CASES ARE COMPLEX OFTEN TWIST ALONG THIS ONE'S A COMPLEX SOME OF THE THINGS THAT AND WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE CONTROLS YOU KNOW WE DEPENDED ON- THE INVESTIGATOR- WHO HAS TO INVESTIGATE A MORE COMPLEX CASE WITH A HIGHER BURDEN WE HAVE TO DEPEND ON. OUR EXPERTS WHO TELL US OR THE TELL THE INVESTIGATORS THE TOURNEY GENERAL OFFICE SAID THIS IS WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PROVE THIS ASSEMBLY DEPARTURE GROSS NEGLIGENCE STRICT DEPARTURE AND THIS LIMITS WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO ALLEGE OR PROVE. MMHM AND THOSE INTO. THE GENERAL- ISSUE ARE YOU- THE- OFFICES HEARINGS THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN TIME LINES AS WELL SO WE HOPE TO DRILL DOWN AND WITH THE MINIMUM OF STANDING JOURNAL DOWN ON THE THINGS THAT HELP US SOLVE THESE LONGEST CASES. GET THEM QUICKER. WE BELIEVE THAT EARLY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN. THE BOARD AND EXTRA YOU WILL BE HELPFUL- ALTHOUGH VERTICALLY FORCING. CHANGE AMERICAN FORCE WAS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION ACTUALLY DID NOT. THE IMAGE OF THE NUMERICAL UNDERSTANDING. SOMETIMES WITH DELAYED SLICKLY BY NOT GOING TO GET MEDICAL RECORDS AND FINES CAN BE IMPOSED TO GET THOSE ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES A SURPRISE SUBPOENA- WE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN GET. LEGISLATION TO HELP- BISCUIT IS GOING TO THE OFFICE OF LOOK AT RECORDS TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER ALLEGATION CAN BE MADE. SOMETIMES WE DON'T GET. A MEDICAL RECORD- THE RELEASE IS BECAUSE THE PATIENT I WANTED TO AFFORD TO RESTATE SHOES BUT WE NEED THOSE MEDICAL RECORDS TO DETERMINE. ANALYTICS SERVER EVER IMPORTANT- I'M SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN ASKING DIFFERENT QUESTIONS WE NEED TO PROVIDE EXPERT POOL AND SOME BY MEMBERS I TALKED ABOUT THE SIZING THAT. WAS TO BE HONEST BOOKED ABOUT A REALLY WANTED TO HELP US WITH THAT WE RECOGNIZE A EXPERTS. ACTUALLY INFLUENCE HOW FAR WE OFTEN CAN GO THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR US TO HAVE GOOD EXPERTS BUT TO HAVE. THE POSITION AVERAGE WHAT IS PERCEIVED AS AN EXODUS OF PRIMITIVE- EXPERT. AND OF COURSE THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION INTO RECORDATION ABOUT COST RECOVERY. THE OPEN INTO THE QUESTIONS IT'S COMPLICATED. NO THIS IS NOT SIMPLE WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB WITH THIS AND WE WILL. THANK YOU SIR WOULD ANYONE ELSE SHOW ME YOUR HAND IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT OR ADD ON TO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO OKAY MISS LUCIANO GO RIGHT AHEAD. YES THANK YOU IF I CAN BUILD UP. ON DR HOPKINS RESPONSE. SO I THINK- YOU KNOW. ONE THING. THAT WE RECOGNIZED AS YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T WE WERE USING VERTICAL ENFORCEMENT. THAT WASN'T WORKING. WE STOPPED DOING THAT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE PROCESS NOW. AND THAT'S- IN A LONGER THAT'S TAKING LONGER THE- LOOKING AT AT AT THE TIME WINSTON BEFORE. SO WE'RE AT A POINT THAT. THOSE TWO METHODS AREN'T WORKING SO WHAT IS THE NEW METHOD AND SO. I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM THAT BROAD PERSPECTIVE. AND THAT TAKES. YOU KNOW THE- THE WORK OF ME THAT INVOLVES NOT JUST THE MEDICAL BOARD BUT ALSO. THE AG'S. AND NDC TO SEE WELL IS THERE A NEW PROCESS THAT COULD PERHAPS SPEED THINGS UP- SO I THINK THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT ALSO DOT AS DOCTOR HAWKINS MENTIONED. YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE OTHER OTHER WAYS WE CAN ATTACK IT ESPECIALLY WITH THE RECORDS- YOU WE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN OUR SENSE THAT REPORT THAT YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE. AN EASY A FAST FIX THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP US YOU KNOW TO GIVE US THOSE POWERS YOU KNOW AND INVESTIGATORS HOURS TO GO IN. AND GET GET FOR IT SPECIFICALLY FOR EXAMPLE PHARMACY RECORDS IN A IN A MUCH FASTER TIME. THAN IT'S HAPPENING NOW THAT CAN CERTAINLY. PETER EFFORTS- AND THEN ALSO AS ALSO MENTION I IN OUR SENSE THAT REPORT- YOU TO HELP US BUILD ON THE TOOLKIT OF RESPONSES- YOU WE GET. AS YOU'VE SEEN IN OVER TEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS IN A YEAR WHICH WE HAVE TO TRIAGE AND- MOST OF THOSE ARE THANKFULLY ARE- YOU KNOW THEY MAY BE MINOR INFRACTIONS OR AT LAST YEAR YES- CASES AND- IF WE HAVE MORE. MATHIS IN OUR TOOL KIT TO MORE SWIFTLY DISPOSABLES AND HANDLE THOSE AND THAT SHOULD SPEED UP THE TIMELINE OVERALL. SAID JUST WANTED TO ADD A LITTLE MORE COLOR. WITH THOSE POINTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP YOU GET SOME OF THOSE TOOLS IN YOUR TOOLKIT WHY CAN'T YOU DISPENSE OF THOSE MINOR INFRACTIONS OF THE TEN THOUSAND. IN A MORE EXPEDITED FASHION SO THAT YOU CAN SPEND TIME. ON THE MORE SERIOUS INFRACTIONS THAT- ARE TAKING A LONG LENGTH OF TIME TO BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF. MAKE A COMMENT. ABSOLUTE HAWKINS. I'M SORRY LAURIE BUT SPEAKER. WELL THE THANK YOU- SO WHAT PEOPLE. I TRAIN PEOPLE SO I THINK THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE FOREIGN INVESTORS H. O. U. OFFERS CERTAIN SKILL SET BY THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T REQUIRE THAT SKILL SET THAT ONCE TRAINED CAN ACTUALLY HANDLE SOME OF THOSE CASES THAT DON'T REQUIRE. AN ALLEGATION OR OR THIS A PUBLIC HARM. IN A RATHER- THAT'S GOING TO GO FURTHER IN THE IN THE IN THE ENFORCEMENT ARENA SO MORE STAFF. IT CAN BE- HELPFUL AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT TO GET A GOOD BALANCE OF WHAT THE KIND OF NUMBERS YOU NEED TO ADDRESS. THE FLOW AND LOCAL I'M IN THE CENTER COMPLAIN UNIT- THE- AND I THINK I'D MENTIONED AND MR THE BILL ALSO TOUCHED ON THE IDEA ABOUT- SO APPROACH TO MEDICAL RECORDS AND- LEGISLATION PUTTING A DO HONOR THAT REVISIT THAT YOURSELF. YES SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH RESPECT TO PHARMACY RECORDS THAT GOES TO- BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE FORTY EIGHTY ONE AND THAT TALKS ABOUT THE PHARMACY HAVING TO PROVIDE THE RECORDS IN A QUOTE UNQUOTE REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. AND SO REASONABLE TO THE PHARMACY COULD BE YOU KNOW EIGHT MONTHS PERHAPS BUT TO THE COMPLAINANT- AND TO US WE'RE TRYING TO PROCESS THESE AND GET THROUGH THE FASTER IT REASONABLE TO LESS IS MORE LIKE TWO WEEKS OR THIRTY OR THIRTY DAYS OR FOR EXAMPLE SO. THAT YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE SOMEWHERE WHERE LEGISLATION COULD COME IN TO HELP US SPEED UP BUT UP A TIMELY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH M. I KNOW ALL OF YOU I'M SURE ALL OF YOU ARE VERY SOLUTION ORIENTATED TO SOLVE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS BUT I SPECIFICALLY. APPRECIATE AND MISLI BEYOND- AND I MISTER HOPKINS YOUR COMMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT. AND YOU'RE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH IT- IF IT- DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL- IN THE AG'S OFFICE AND TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS AND THEN FEED GIVE US FEEDBACK AS THE LEGISLATURE. AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY SIMPLE SOLUTION I MEAN WHY CAN'T WE GO IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE FROM REASONABLE TIME TO THIRTY DAYS TO PULL A RECORD. AND GET BACK TO YOU WHICH WOULD HELP EXPEDITE IT AND THE PROCESS AND HELP YOU GUYS. AND BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE COMMUNITY SO TANK YOU FOR THAT. AND I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BUT I AM GOING TO MAKE A COMMENT AND- MR BEYOND- I JUST- NOT TO BELABOR THE POINT NINETY SEVENTY SIX BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I TO- AS A MOM AND A GRANDMA. I THINK MOTHERS IN INITIAL INSTINCT IS A LIKE A LIONESS RIGHT PROTECT YOUR PET PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN. AND I TO LOOKED IN THE EYES OF THOUSANDS OF PARENTS DURING THAT PROCESS THEY TRULY BELIEVE IN FELT FROM THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEART AND HAD MEDICAL EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT. THEY FELT THAT TO AND THEIR CHILD THAT WAS QUOTE UNQUOTE NORMAL BEFORE CERTAIN VACCINES AND THEN BECAME EITHER AND LEGS ATROPHIED OR HAD ISSUES THEM. OCULAR DEGENERATION AND OTHERS- THAT WERE PROMINENT AND- AND THE FEAR OF NOT VACCINE ARE YOU KNOW NOT VACCINATING THEIR SECOND OR THIRD CHILD- FOR FEAR OF A FAMILY ISSUE. AND I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS I MEAN THE SENATE PRO TEM AND I'M SURE BOTH REMEMBER THOSE DAYS BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTIVELY IN THE BUILDING. BUT M. SO I SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU HAVING A CONCERN. ABOUT A PARENT'S CONCERN FOR THEIR CHILD SO- I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR THAT AS WELL ND I'VE NEVER QUESTIONS MA'AM PROTECT. THANK YOU SENATOR. GROVE MAN OF ICE HERE. THANK YOU. AND- CAN TO ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR- APPOINTMENTS I DON'T. SKEWS ME MY ALLERGIES WITH THESE MASKS ANYWAY- I LOOKED AT YOUR RESUMES OUR THIRTY DAM IN DOUBT I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET WITH YOU INDIVIDUALLY BUT AS I READ THOSE I THOUGHT WHAT AN INCREDIBLE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE STEPPED FORWARD TO SERVE ON THE MEDICAL BOARD AND CERTAINLY ARE HI FIVE TO DOCTOR HAWKINS WHO'S BEEN THERE FOR A- WHAT IS IT NOW ABOUT SEVEN YEARS SIX AND A HALF YEARS AND- IT IS A VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND AND WE ALL KNOW THAT I AM ON THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS. COMMITTEE AND WE DID THE SUNSET REVIEW OF THE MEDICAL BOARD IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT MOST OF THE ISSUES WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE. CERTAINLY OUT OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL CONTROL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR DISCUSSION WITH A GOOD SENATOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM. THE CENTRAL VALLEY ON BECAUSE- IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A- DEEPER AND LONGER LOOK AT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO RESOLVE. I THINK THE DEFICIT THAT ARE THERE ARE THE COSTS THAT WERE SHARED WITH US. FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE OPERATING ABOARD IN TWO THOUSAND SIX SEVEN. IT IS MUSHROOM TO FIFTEEN. AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS- THIS LAST FISCAL YEAR TO EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN TERMS OF THAT KIND OF COST OF THE WORK THAT YOU DO. BECAUSE DURING THAT SUNSET REVIEW IT APPEARED TO BE THE COSTS THAT. DO COME FORWARD THE INVESTIGATION SAW. WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THEY WILL BE PROVIDING A FROM. FROM I THINK A PATH WHERE WE CAN FIND A BALANCE HERE OF FOR ALL THE BOARDS BUT IN PARTICULAR THIS ONE. BECAUSE I THINK THE GOALS THAT YOU SET FORTH. IN YOUR PRESENTATION. YEAH COTTON FELL I WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE TRUST THE TRANSPARENCY ON CERTAINLY ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR THOSE WHO COME BEFORE THE BOARD WITH THEIR COMPLAINTS. SO I THINK THE ONLY THING LEFT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I'M ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED IN QUITE A JOB. WOULD BE THE COMPLAINT PROCESS FILE IN OUR LAST REVIEW OF MEDICAL BOARD MEMBERS THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT COMPLAINT TENTH CAN'T TRACK. OF THE PROGRESS OF THEIR COMPLAINT I THINK THAT GOES A LONG WAY IN TERMS OF IF THERE'S A SYSTEM I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON IT I BELIEVE THAT WITH THE INFORMATION PROVIDED. I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S UP AND RUNNING BUT CLEAR CLEARLY THAT WILL HELP A LOT BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE. ARE NOT IN THE KNOW AND THEY'RE FRUSTRATED THAT'S WHEN ALL OF THE- ANGST DEVELOPED AND THEN IT BECOMES ANGRY AND THEN IT BECOMES AN OUTRAGE THAT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR JOB AND IF SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT VERY COMPLEX JOB THAT YOU DO HAVE. WITH OUR MEDICAL PROFESSION AND WE HA HA HOLD ALL OF THEM IN HIGH REGARD. SOME NOT FROM YOU KNOW WANDER OFF THE PATH AND FIND THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW COMPLAINING BEING INVESTIGATED BUT THAT THAT IS YOUR JOB BUT WE DO NEED TO ADD TO KNOW. IF YOU'VE MOVED ALONG ON THAT COMPLAINT PROCESS IF THERE IS A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THAT SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE- YOU KNOW. COMPLETING ARE NOT FIGHTING PARTICULAR SITUATIONS ARE THAT RISE TO A COMPLAINT AND INVESTIGATION HOW THEY'RE NOTIFIED. AND IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S EASILY ACCESSIBLE FOR THEM WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS THAT AND I GUESS DR HAWK AND SHE'S. BEEN THERE THE LONGEST AND PROBABLY BEEN INVOLVED WITH THAT YOU. MIGHT WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION DIRECTLY. YES SIR ALL. IN IN THANK YOU FOR YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF IT- IT'S BEEN. YEARS ON THE- AND- IT'S A DIFFICULT BOARD THE- THERE CHALLENGES IT'S A VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT BOARD THAT SPENDING IN A DOLLAR EACH. ONE OF THE THINGS INDIVIDUAL BEING REPETITIVE NOW IS THAT WE NEED AND WILL BE MORE RESPONSIVE- TO THE CONSUMERS ARE STAKEHOLDERS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING SEEN AND HEARD IN A WAY THAT THEY WANT TO BE AND DESERVE TO BE. AND WE HAVE SOME FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE CALL NOW MR LOOK BEYOND DISCOVERED THEY'RE BOTH AND MYSELF FOR ALL ON THIS. UNDERGROUND REACH- COMMUNICATION AND- WELLNESS COMMITTEE AND YOU HEARD FROM THE DISCUSSIONS THE SKILLS THAT THEY- BRING. TO THIS PROBLEM. DAHLE SAID SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH SOME OTHER STAKEHOLDERS CENTER FOR PUBLIC OUTREACH. SENATE REPUBLICAN LAW AND DIEGO DURING WITH THEM TO HELL US. HELLO WITH THE CONSUMERS AND SO OF FOR HAVE BEEN ALSO. TO DO A BETTER- AT THE PRESENT TIME THE NEW SYSTEM THIS IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PORTAL BACK THAT IS SET UP- IN A WAY SECURELY THAT THE COMPLAINING CAN ACTUALLY TRACK WHERE. THE INVESTIGATION IS IN THEIR ALLEGATION THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TOGET- AND WE'RE GETTING THERE BUT I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT TIME FOR WHATEVER OCCURRED. WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING IS THAT- THE COMPLAINT IT SHOULD BE GETTING A PAPER. EMAIL THEY CAN KNOWLEDGE AND IF THEY'RE CASES CLOSE OF HIS MOVES TO THE NEXT LEVEL DOES NOT GIVE ENOUGH DETAIL- BUT THAT'S CLOSELY HAVING ALREADY- AND- I AFTER TALKING TO THE C. THE CHAIR OF THE- FEDERAL PLAY UNIT I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT THAT IS IN FACT HAPPENING. BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THAT FROM THE PUBLIC- SO WE'RE WORKING ON PRIORITY. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WILL WILL SOLVE THAT BUT IT'S IT IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF THINGS LIKE CONFIDENTIALITY. I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL. HELPFUL AND- PLEASE CALL AN ALPHA FOR WHAT WE MIGHT DO TO ASSIST YOU IN IN ON YOUR GOALS AND CERTAINLY THE OBJECTIVES THAT MUST BE THERE TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE GOALS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE LEGISLATURE FITS SANDERS HELPING WITH THOSE- YOU KNOW ACTUAL- PROPHECIES REGULATIONS WHATEVER. THAT WILL ASSIST YOU GETTING TO A WHERE ARE OUR MEDICAL BOARD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST REGARD. THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND I KNOW YOU WANT THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT THAT AND CERTAINLY FOR OUR CONSTITUENCIES YOU HAVE DOWN WE HAVE THEM AND WE SHARE THEM AS A MATTER OF FACT IS WHAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE THEM SO THANK YOU AND DOC. I WILL PASS THE MICROPHONE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES I HEAR I THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME THINGS LEFT THAT NEEDS. OUR DISCUSSION ALSO BUT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR SERVICE AND ALL I DO BELIEVE OUT IF IT'S A REALLY- VERY GOOD GROUP PUBLIC MEMBERS DOCTORS ON THERE THAT GIVE THAT DIVERSITY- FOR A PERSPECTIVE THAT I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT. FOR ANYBODY WHO'S HAD AN ISSUE WITH THEIR VISION OR THEIR HEALTHCARE. PROVIDER THANK YOU. Q. ADVISED- SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM. AND I. THE MEETING WITH ALL FOR OF YOU YESTERDAY. AND THE DESPITE WHAT DOES SENATOR BATES SAID THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT HASN'T BEEN TALKED ABOUT YET- AND I DECIDED. SINCE IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT WHEN WE HAVE FOUR FIVE TOGETHER AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO RESPOND THIS TIME I DECIDED BASED ON OUR MEETING I WAS GONNA WRITE SOMETHING THAT EACH OF YOU SAID AND ASK YOU ABOUT IT FOLLOW UP INDIVIDUALLY AND THUS FAR. EVERY SINGLE ONE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED WHETHER IT'S- THE IT WAS- MISTER BROOKS SAYING YOU CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU CAN'T MEASURE- FOR- DOCTOR HAWKINS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE BACKLOG OF CASES AND SAYING. THE PUBLIC IS TALKING BUT WERE NOT RESPONDING FOR MISS CAR WILL BE ON TALKING ABOUT TIME LINES. AND I THOUGHT THAT JUST DO ONE THING AND THAT IS THAT. THIS HEARING IS NOTABLY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER ONE WE HAD ON THE MEDICAL BOARD AND I HAVE ASSESSED. THE THAT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE MOSTLY PUBLIC MEMBERS ED AND- OUR OF REPRESENT THE PUBLIC. TO THE BOARD IN A WAY THAT THAT IT JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE LEVEL OF INTENSITY THAT OUR PREVIOUS HEARING AND SO THE ONE THING IS. I WAS STRUCK BY A MIS COMPA VERDES. PERSONAL STORY AND IT CAME UP IN OUR A MEETING AND YOU BROUGHT IT UP BRIEFLY. IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT BUT YOU EVEN PRODUCED A DOCUMENTARY FILM CALLED INHERITANCE ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT YOU ALLUDED TO. AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE REALLY IMPORTANT IN MAKING THAT POINT ABOUT HOW PUBLIC MEMBERS ARE INFORMED BY THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE AND BRING THAT TO THIS IN A DIFFERENT WIFE THAT. THAT MAYBE YOU TALK ABOUT. WHAT YOU DID IN THAT FILM. S. N. AND YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND HOW IT INFORMS YOU BEING. ON THE MEDICAL BOARD I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO EVERYONE IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND. I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION SENATOR AND- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE IT WOULD SERVICE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND THAT THE PIECE OF IT AS MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL BOARD IN THE FILM THE IDEA BEHIND IT AND IT KIND OF CAME TOGETHER AS I WAS GOING THROUGH MY OWN SURGICAL JOURNEY THE IDEA BEHIND IT WAS TO REALLY SHOW THE NEW WANTS TO THE REALITY OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO TRY TO SAVE YOUR OWN LIFE. AND A LOT OF WAYS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL DOING WHEN WE ENGAGE WITH THE MEDICAL SYSTEM WE'RE ALL TRYING TO SAVE OUR OWN LIVES WE'RE ALL TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS WE CAN'T AND ELONGATE OUR LIVES AND THOSE OF OUR LOVED ONES AND SO WATCHING WOMEN GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS IN MY FILM AND THE HARD HARD CHOICES THEY'VE HAD TO MAKE AND THE MODEL CHOICES THEY'VE HAD TO MAKE WAS SOMETHING THAT IS YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S ROCK ARE NO MATTER WHAT. ILLNESS OR DISEASE SOMEONE HAS TO DEAL WITH THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL UNIVERSALLY SHARE AND SO I BRING THAT PERSPECTIVE TO EVERY CONVERSATION EVERY MEETING THAT I HAVE AROUND THE MEDICAL BOARD AND I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE TRYING TO PUT OURSELVES IN THE SHOES OF YOU KNOW THESE AREN'T THIS CASE NUMBERS THESE ARE JUST COMPLAINTS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HURT AND WHO ARE HURTING AND SO HOW CAN WE- BRING THAT EMPATHY AND RESPECT. TO THE WAY WE COMPORT OURSELVES AND ALWAYS HAVE THAT IDEA BE THE GUIDING LIGHT OF THE BOARD THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE CERTAINLY BUT THAT HAS TO BE AT THE CORE OF WHAT WE DO IF YOU ARE ABLE TO REALLY MAKE MEET. OUR MISSION OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU ON IT'S NOT A EASY TO TOW. YOUR OWN STORY IT'S GOING TO BE A PLEASURE TO VOTE FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED AND- I'M GLAD YOU. ACTUALLY DID THAT I WAS MOVED AND COMPELLED BY YOUR OPENING COMMENTS ALSO. HAS COME A VERDE AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT. I DO ACTUALLY HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT I WANT TO SET SOME CONTEXT- CONFIRMATIONS BY THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE ARE REALLY THE WAY THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO OUR CONSTITUENTS- AND I THINK- AS SENATOR LAYERED ALLUDED TO. OUR INTRODUCTION WAS THE CONFIRMATION HEARING OF THREE OF THE- PHYSICIAN MEMBERS OF THE BOARD. AND IT WAS- IT WAS A ROUGH HEARING ACTUALLY FOR US AND WE MOVE THOSE CONFEREES TO THE FLOOR AND THEY HAVE SINCE BEEN CONFIRMED. SINCE THEN WE'VE ALSO HAD THE ABILITY AS MY COLLEAGUES- VICE CHAIRWOMAN SAID- IT TO WITNESS AND WATCH SOME OF THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS IT'S TAKING PLACE WITH THE BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE. AND I THINK THAT GETS BACK TO THE COMMENT THAT MS COM LONGER MADE- HER TECHNICAL TERM WAS HOT MESS UP BUT I THINK. REALLY HOW I WOULD REDIRECT THAT STATEMENT IS I LISTEN TO THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS. AND IT WAS CLEAR TO ME AFTER HAVING HEARD FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN THAT THE BOARD WAS NOT EXACTLY. FULLY ENGAGED IN THE PUBLIC PROTECTION PIECE OF AND THAT WAS THEIR CONCERN AND WE HEARD THAT AT OUR LAST HEARING. IT WAS UNCLEAR TO ME WHETHER THROUGH THE ATTORNEY OF THE BOARD. THE EXECUTIVE OF THE BOARD. AND THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE BOARD MEMBER MAYBE TO THAT SPOKE THAT THERE'S ON CLARITY IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS AND HOW MANY CASES ARE HANDLED AND WHAT THE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS ARE- AND THAT WAS REALLY TROUBLING TO ME IN THE SHORT TIME THAT I LISTENED MANNER VICE CHAIRWOMAN YOU WERE ON THE COMMITTEE. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY- I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE INABILITY OF- THROUGH THAT PROCESS TO GET A SENSE. OF THERE'S A LARGE VOLUME OF CASES THAT'S VERY CLEAR TEN THOUSAND AND THEN YOU AS MISS LUCIANO SAYS. YOU WANT TO YOU WANT IT YOU WANT TO EFFICIENTLY AND QUICKLY DEAL WITH THE MORE MINOR. NOT MINOR IN THE MINDS OF PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN BUT THE MORE- LESS EGREGIOUS SO THAT YOU CAN SPEND THE TIME ON THE MORE DIFFICULT CASES- WHAT WHAT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION AND WE REALLY HAVE NO WAY TO GAUGE THIS AS LEGISLATORS IS THAT. WHEN REVIEWING CASES THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE INFORMATION THAT OUR STAFF HAVE PROVIDED US THAT THERE ARE TWO PANELS. EACH OF YOU SERVE ON ONE OF THOSE PANELS. TO REVIEW CASES APPLY DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES AND THAT THERE SEEM TO BE SOME QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THERE'S A DEVIATION FROM THOSE GUIDELINES- AND TO THE AMOUNT OF ABILITY TO DEVIATE GOD. THAT MAY BE GIVE LAW- PENALTIES- ON SOME OF THE MORE EGREGIOUS CASES SO I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I WAS RESOLVED. IN LISTENING TO THE SUNSET REVIEW HEARING- THAT THERE WAS AGREEMENT AND YOU AS BOARD MEMBERS. I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO I THINK UNDERSTAND THOSE NUMBERS AND TO UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC WHO. MAYBE HAS LOST TRUST OR HAS SOME CONCERN. THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION. THAT CONCERNS ME- I DO BELIEVE THAT- THAT THE VALUE OF THE PUBLIC ROLE AND THE VALUE OF THE DOCTORS WHO SERVE ON THIS BOARD ARE BOTH IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE I BELIEVE IT IS THE TWO TOGETHER. THAT REALLY PRODUCE THE PRODUCT THAT CAN MAKE THE PUBLIC FEEL COMFORTABLE- AND SO I THINK% BOTH HAVE VALUE HAVEN'T KIND OF SAID THAT STAGE THE BOARD HAS TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF THE FEE INCREASE BECAUSE THERE IS INSOLVENCY IS AN ISSUE THERE'S THE COST FACTOR AND OBVIOUSLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE COSTS THAT HAVE GONE UP THERE- THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU GET TO CONTROL DIRECTLY. YOU HAVE TO REACT TO IT- SO WITH THOSE THINGS IN MIND THE THREE PHYSICIANS THAT WE TALKED TO AT OUR LAST ARE. HEARING ALL WAIT N. R. AND GAVE US RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH THE INSOLVENCY ISSUE. NOT JUST IN TERMS OF THE FEE INCREASE THAT MIGHT HAVE TO BE CONSIDEREDAN AT WHAT LEVEL ON THE BALANCE OF THAT DEBT. CENTER COME LONGER BROUGHT UP IN DOCTOR HAWKINS RESPONDED TO- WOOD I A FROM EACH OF YOU. AND THEY SAID IN THEIR LETTER OF RESPONSE TO US EACH OF THOSE POSITIONS THAT COST RECOVERY WAS ALSO A FACTOR BEING CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD. SO I WILL START WITH YOU- DOCTOR HAWKINS AND ASK IS COST RECOVERY. SOMETHING THAT THE BOARD IS LOOKING AT AND SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER TO BE ONE TOOL IN THE TOOL KIT TO. MANAGE COSTS BUT ALSO HOPEFULLY BE ONE OF THE TOOLS TO HELP SHORTEN THE PROCESS OF THE INVESTIGATIVE. PIECE OF WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH. YES IT CERTAINLY IS AND I WOULD. INDICATE WHEN I HAD MEETINGS WITH THE CASTRO OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SHE REASSURED ME THAT CASACORNELIA ABOUT THE BOARD'S ACTUALLY DOES WORK. IS IT DOES HELP ACCOMPLISH YOUR CAN HELP ACCOMPLISH THE THINGS LIKE THE- THE TIME IT TAKES TO CLOSE CASES THE WILLINGNESS OF. PHYSICIANS TO. ENGAGE ACCEPTABLE STIPULATED SETTLEMENTS ARE OFFERED XCERRA SO YES WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS AND YES IT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED I'M MIXED ON THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT BOARD AND THEY HAVE COST RECOVERY. AND THEY ASSURED ME THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THANK YOU DR MISSILE BEYOND NO COST RECOVERY IS THAT A TOOL POTENTIALLY IN THE TOOL KIT TO HELP WITH SOME OF THE COMPLEX ISSUES AND RESOLUTION OF CASES. YES ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT WOULD- THAT WOULD DEFINITELY HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING IN THE PLAYING FIELD. WITH THEIR CASES BECAUSE YOU KNOW. AS OUR FINANCIAL SITUATION HAS PUT US- HAS IT HAS PUT US IN THE IN THE PLACE WHERE IT COSTS IS TOP OF MIND WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW FAR TO PUSH A CASE THROUGH. THIRD SO DEFINITELY YES THANK YOU MISS CONTRAVIR DAY YOUR THOUGHTS ON COST RECOVERY IS AN OPTION. YES I SUPPORTED IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'RE ONE OF THE FEW IF NOT THE ONLY DISABLE OR WHO DOES NOT HAVE COST RECOVERY FOR- OUR DOCTORS AND SO I DO SUPPORT THAT. THANK YOU AND MISTER BROOKS I KNOW THAT YOU HAVEN'T YET HAD A CHANCE TO ATTEND A MEETING BUT GIVEN. YOUR HISTORY OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE- YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FROM YOUR SERVICE ALREADY IS THAT SOMETHING YOU THINK THIS BOARD SHOULD CONSIDER. WHAT THEY CONSIDER 1100% YOU KNOW ON THE BOARD OF PHARMACY WE DO HAVE COST RECOVERY. AND IT'S DONE IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT% WAYS ONE STIPULATED DECISIONS EVERY STIPULATED DECISION HAS TO HAVE A FINANCIAL COMPONENT TO IT. BUT IN ORDER FOR THAT STIPULATED DECISION TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN SOCCER WHEN WE LOOK AT. LICENSING THE REINSTATING A- DOCTOR YOU KNOW. THAT REINSTATEMENT SAYS WE HAVE TO PAY- PENALTIES FEES AND THE COST OF THE BEST FISH BEFORE WILL REINSTATE SURE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE LIGHTS. I DO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSES. THE OTHER ON THE OTHER QUICK I ANSWER- AND SORRY FOR MY CONTEXT I THINK IT LENDS TO. OUR DESIRE TO SEE YOU BE ABLE TO DO THIS VERY DIFFICULT JOB THAT YOU'RE DOING WITH SOME MEASURE OF SUPPORT BUT BUT ALSO THE PUBLIC TRUST. THERE HAS BEEN A WE RECEIVED A LETTER AFTER OUR LAST HEARING FROM- A CUT US A COUPLE OF STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. THAT BASICALLY SAID THEY THINK THERE SHOULD BE- MORE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION ON THE BOARD RIGHT NOW I THINK IT IS- EIGHT OUR MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS MEDICAL DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS VARIOUS CATEGORIES. PHYSICIAN FACULTY PHYSICIAN- AND THEN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THERE ARE EIGHT. PHYSICIAN AND SEVEN OUR PUBLIC MEMBERS- DO YOU THINK THE BOARD COULD BE SERVED BY ADDITIONAL PUBLIC PARTICIPATION CERTAINLY AGAIN NOT TAKEN AWAY FROM THE VALUE WHICH IS. EVIDENT OF THE PHYSICIAN MEMBERS- MS LIBBY I LET ME ASK YOU THAT MORE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION ON THIS BOARD. AS AN OPTION. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES WE CAN OKAY GREAT- MY POSITION ON THIS IS IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES IF THAT'S ONE ONE AVENUE WHERE THE PUBLIC FEELS MORE REPRESENTED- ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. IS CONTRAVIR DAY YOUR THOUGHTS ON ADDITIONAL PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. I WOULD SUPPORTADDITIONAL PUBLIC PARTICIPATION I ALSO DO WANT TO ADD THAT I THINK IT ULTIMATELY COMES DOWN TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL- VERSUS A PHYSICIAN VERSUS PUBLIC MEMBER- AND EQUITATION BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD SUPPORT MARKED UP WITH MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER BROOKS. WILL NOT HAVE TO A BOARD MEETING SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE THE FOR CONTENT RIGHT. IF THAT'S A FAIR STATEMENT THAT'S A VERY FAIR STATEMENT. AS A PUBLIC MEMBER ON THE BOARD OF PHARMACY- THE DALLAS WAS ALWAYS IMPORTANT AND BUILDING TRUST WAS ALWAYS IMPORTANT. TO BUILD THE TRUST FACTOR AND LOCAL BORDER IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE LEGISLATURE IN SOME OF THESE ARE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING NOTED- WHAT'S AND SELF OUT. MISTER BROOKS- FORGIVE ME I SHOULD ALWAYS KNOW THIS I GUESS BUT WHAT WAS THE BREAKDOWN ON THE PHARMACY BOARD PUBLIC VERSUS- DO YOU REMEMBER AND YOU. DON'T HAVE THE EXACT COUNT FROM. OKAY DR HAWKINS. THANK YOU- I'M NOT OPPOSED TO ADDITION OTHER MEMBERS THAT I WOULD ECHO WITH THIS CONTROVERSY IS STATED AT THAT. WE ALL BRING OUR LIFE'S EXPERIENCE TRAINING. TO THE TABLE AND WE USE THAT TO HELP US DECIDE WHAT WE GONNA DO IN A PARTICULAR SITUATION. FOR EXAMPLE I'M A CONSUMER ADVOCATE. THE MEDICAL FOR BUT- MY PRIVATE PRACTICE. HAS WE NATURALLY FLOWING FROM MY- THERE WHICH ARE TO THE AS WELL- WE HAVE A ACTIVE DIALOGUE- THIS EXAMPLE. IS WILL BE ON OUR ON THE SAME. AND SO WITH A GOOD EXTRA. WE HAVE BECAUSE HAVE TO HAVE BOTH. THE PUBLIC AND- PHYSICIAN ASSISTED MEMBERS BUT I WE HAVE TO BE VERY AND DELIVER. ABOUT WHO'S RECOMMENDED. AND WHO IS. APPROVED TO MAKE SURE ID ONE THAT THE PERSONS PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTAND THE MISSION OF THE PORT. THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO. PUT THAT FIRST AND PARAMOUNT AND THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO LEARN- FROM THE EXPERIENCES THE BOARDS TO HAVE MAKE IT BEARABLE. AND I'VE BEEN THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH PUBLIC OR NON PUBLIC I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. THE PUBLIC MEMBERS- AND I APPRECIATE THE PHYSICIAN MEMBERS AND ARMY THE HEDGE TO MUCH EXCEPT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO TRY TO GET A FEELING FOR THE CHARACTER. THE HELLO CHRIS WHO THE PERSON WANTS TO PROVIDE SERVICE WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE AND SHOWING THAT IN THE PAST. THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT A SELECTION. ROSS'S THANK YOU WELL DOCTOR HAWKINS I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I THINK I TO THE POINT OF YOUR CONCERNS EACH OF YOU HAVE EXPRESSED THIS CONCERNS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND THE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC IN THE WORK THAT YOU DO ON THEIR BEHALF ON THIS BOARD- I THINK YOUR POINT IS VERY WELL TAKEN AND I THINK THE PUBLIC. WHO BASICALLY SAYS THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THAT'S THE LENS THROUGH WHICH THEY PUT THEIR CONCERNS AND THAT IS THE SOLUTION THEY COME UP WITH TO MAKE THE SITUATION BETTER UT I THINK YOUR RESPONSE WAS POINT ON POINT ABSOLUTELY BOTH YOURS AND- MISS COBB OF VERDES IN TERMS OF THE COMMITMENT THAT THE BOARD MEMBER. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT- I WANT TO THANK EACH OF YOU- CLEARLY- YOU KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT JOB AND IT IS ONE THAT YOU'RE DEDICATED TO AND SO MUCH TO THE POINT THAT YOU- THE CITY THROUGH THE PROCESS WHERE YOU GET TO HEAR ARE HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT. HOW THE BOARD REPRESENTS THEM I WOULD SAY AND ASK. THAT YOU GIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO- TO LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS ARE EVALUATING A LITTLE MORE- IN DETAIL WHETHER THE GUIDELINES ARE BEING FOLLOWED TO THE DEGREE THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FEEL LIKE- OF THE ACTION THAT IS NECESSARY NECESSARY FROM THESE PANELS AND THE DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDING- THAT IT SEEMS THAT THAT WORK IS BEING DONE AND THOSE THAT DESERVE THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT IS HAPPENING. THAT THE GUIDELINES ARE NOT.
