WE HAD NO IDEA JUST HELP GRAPPLING COMPLETELY IT WOULD CHANGE OUR LIVES TODAY AS WE KNOW THE INTERNET IS CRITICAL TO FREE EXPRESSION FREE SPEECH AS WELL AS DEMOCRACY. THAT'S WHY THE DECISION BY THE CURRENT -- A MAKEUP OF THE FCC -- MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE CURRENT OF PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP IS ON EXPLICABLE WITH REGARDS TO RESCINDING THE NET NEUTRALITY. HAVING IS SORT OF A INDIVIDUAL STATE APPROACH -- IS -- BUT IT IS IT IS A TASK AND I WOULD CONCUR THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT -- BUT UNLESS WE CAN HAVE A A A NATIONAL UNIFORM Y. THIS CAN BE STATUTORY OR THROUGH THE REGULATORY SIDE THROUGH THE FCC. I THINK STATES SUCH AS CALIFORNIA HAS PROVEN TO BE A LEADER AND INNOVATOR A DISRUPTOR OF THE STATUS QUO HAS TO DEMONSTRATE OF THAT LEADERSHIP. OF FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND HOPEFULLY MOVE TOWARD A MODEL THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AND THEREFORE. THE HOPEFULLY FOR SECURITY MINISTRATION TO ADOPT UP ONCE AGAIN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN NET NEUTRALITY MEASURES -- I SHOULD THAT MEASURES BASIC RULES OF LUMIA A CUT TO THE CHASE SENATE BILL[inaudible] FOUR SIXTY OF THE THE PROVISIONS THAT THIS MEASURE OR VERY SIMPLE AND STRAIGHT FORWARD. OF THE PRESERVES THE HEART OF THE FCC'S NET NEUTRALITY RULES OF BRAVES EYES PEACEFUL BLOCKING THROWING AND MP PARTS RISE ASIAN THAT IS -- WITHIN SENATE BILL EIGHT TO TWO BECAUSE WE AS A STATE GOVERNMENT ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS WE SUBCONTRACT -- A WE SHOULD SAY WE WE SIX A CONTRACTOR TO DO THAT WHETHER IT'S A CONTROVERSIAL AGENCIES SUCH AS THE DMB FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER IT IS OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES -- WE HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET -- TO GIVE -- CONSUMERS ACCESS -- DOT CITIZENS ACCESS TO OUR STATE AGENCIES SO THEREFORE WE SUBCONTRACT WITH ALL THE INTERCEPT INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. WITH THIS MEASURE DOES IN SHORT IS THAT [inaudible] IF THE I USE PEACE DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF NET NEUTRALITY. AS ENVISIONED IN SENATE BILL. EIGHT TO TWO THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING TO ANY TYPE OF CONTRACTS. WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE VARIOUS AGENCIES -- THROUGHOUT -- STATE GOVERNMENT. OF WHAT THE BILL IS VERY SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND TO THE POINT HE GOES WITH -- SENATE BILL EIGHT TWENTY TWO IT'S IT'S VERY CLEAR REASONABLE STANDARDS FOR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND OFFERS IN THIS IS OUR PROTECTIONS FOR BOTH ONLINE BUSINESSES AS WELL AS CONSUMERS. NO IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO WORK -- WITH MISTER WEINER I KNOW YOU MISTER CHAIR -- HAS A YOU HAVE PLAYED IT A HUGE -- ON THE ISSUE OF OF PRIVACY A INTERNET PRIVACY NO ONE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT TO OPENLY PUBLICLY THE ROLE THAT YOU HAVE PLAYED. A BECAUSE IT IS RECOGNIZED AND BOTH THE SENATE AS WELL OBVIOUSLY WITH MANY -- CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUPS -- NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY THAT'S WHAT THE MEASURE DOES. THEIR FORCIBLY MISS CHERUBS VISSCHER ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SENATOR ON ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ARE. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD.

BRIAN BLAKELEY UP BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANKS PLACE. AND ABOUT CAN BE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MUCH. OPPOSITION PLEASE COME ON UP WELCOME ANYTIME YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IT'S NICE TO BE BACK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. A MY NAME IS BILL DIVINE I REPRESENT EIGHTEEN TAPE. I LET ME START BY SAYING THAT EIGHTEEN TIAS ALWAYS SUPPORTED AND OPEN INTERNET. OUR COMMITMENTS ARE PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE THEIR ENFORCEABLE BY THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE FCC. HOWEVER I AM HERE TODAY TO OPPOSE SP FOUR SIXTY WE BELIEVE FOR SIXTY IS FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN JUST PRESENTED. IT WILL REQUIRE STATE AGENCIES TO INTERPRET AND ENFORCE THE CURRENT COMPLEX AND CONFUSING PROVISIONS IN SB A TWENTY TWO REQUIREMENTS. THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OBAMA FCC NET NEUTRALITY ORDER. JUST FIFTY EIGHT DAYS AGO THIS COMMITTEE HEARD SP A TWENTY TWO AND PROPOSED A SOLUTION TO THIS PARTICULAR CONCERN. THIS WAS ADDRESSED IN YOUR JUNE TWENTY SIXTH ANALYSIS WHICH ON PAGE ELEVEN STATED QUOTE THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE DEBATE ASIDE THERE APPEARS TO BE A RELATIVELY EASY SOLUTION TO RESOLVE THE MATTER. THE ANALYSIS CONTINUE THE AUTHOR MAY WISH TO CONSIDER AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD REMOVE ALL ROOM FOR DEBATE IN THIS LEGISLATION. AND THE COMMITTEE OFFERED LANGUAGE TO THAT EFFECT THAT WAS DECLINED BY THE AUTHOR OF BOTH A TWENTY TWO AS WELL AS FOR SIXTY WE BELIEVE ADDING. OTHER REQUIREMENT TO DO THE OBAMA ORDER -- IS THE BEST APPROACH EIGHT TWENTY TWO IS FLAWED LANGUAGE AND UNDERSTAND S. B.. FOR SIXTY IS LINKED DIRECTLY. TO EIGHT TWENTY TWO THE AGENCY CANNOT -- A THE AGENCY CANNOT -- OF OR MUST ABIDE BY NET NEUTRALITY PRINCIPLES BUT AS ARE SPELLED OUT IN SB. EIGHT TWENTY TWO FORCING STATE AGENCIES TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH THE BILL IS BOTH UNTESTED. UNPRECEDENTED WE THINK IT'LL CREATE DELAY. AND CONFUSION CUT DURING THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS WE ALSO THINK SKILL I'D SIGNIFICANTLY EXPENSE TO THE AGENCIES WHO WILL NOW HAVE TO DEVELOP EXPERTISE ON THE SUBJECT OF NET NEUTRALITY. AS WELL AS MONITOR AND ENFORCE BEHAVIORS AS COMPLAINTS MAY ARISE IT WILL ALSO CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE PROTEST. IN THE STATE PROCUREMENT PROCESS. NOW YOU WOULD RECOMMENDED AN AMENDMENT AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO STAFF BRIEFLY IN THE HALLWAY ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS THERE'S A SUGGESTED AMENDMENT. THAT SPEAKS TO THE ISSUE ACCEPTED BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES SHALL NOT NECESSARILY EXCLUDE ENTERPRISE SERVICE OFFERINGS AS DEFINED IN THAT SECTION. ENTERPRISE SERVICE OFFERINGS FREQUENTLY ARE CUSTOM DESIGNED PROGRAMS OR SERVICES FOR BOTH STATE GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THEY ARE THINGS WHERE THE CUSTOMER AND THE A COMPANY PROVIDING THE SERVICE CUSTOMIZE. A SERVICE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THAT CUSTOMER -- THAT WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE OBAMA ORDER IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IT IS ALSO EXCLUDED. FROM THE OF OUR S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO TWO SENATOR WIENER EXCLUDED ENTERPRISE SERVICES WHY DO WE CARE. FREQUENTLY AND AGENCY WILL ASK FOR A CUSTOMIZED SERVICE ADDED ON TO WHATEVER THEIR PURCHASING IT MIGHT BE FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY WANT TO BLOCK. EMPLOYEES FROM BEING ABLE TO GO TO ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES ON A STATE WEBSITE ON THE JOB. ITS A SIMPLE WAY TO ENHANCE EFFICIENCIES STATES MANY TIMES WILL BY THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES BUT THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE VENDOR TO BUILD INTO THE PROGRAM. BLOCKING. THING THAT THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT SO IT'S A SMALL NEW WANTS BUT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE DOING. IS ELIMINATING THE KIND OF CUSTOM FEATURES THAT ARE ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THE STATE AND INCREASE EFFICIENCY. NOW THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS THAT FIT INTO THAT CATEGORY THAT I HAVE NOT HAD THE TIME TO RESEARCH BECAUSE WE JUST GOT YOUR ANALYSIS. BUT WE WOULD BE CAUTIOUS HERE AND WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT TO BE WITHDRAWN AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. I MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CAROLINE MCINTYRE ON BEHALF OF THAT CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION WE WILL ALIGN THE FIRST PART OF OUR COMMENTS WITH THAT THOSE OF EIGHTEEN T.. I WOULD HOWEVER I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT GIVEN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN AS BEFORE SIXTY AN S. B.. EIGHT TWO TWO EIGHT TWO TWO OF COURSE WE BELIEVE IS PREEMPTED WE ALSO BELIEVE FOR SIXTY WOOD AND ALSO BE PREEMPTED GIVEN ITS RELIANCE ON THE AND PROVISIONS OF SB. EIGHT TO TO THE U. S. SUPREME COURT HAS IN FACT I HAVE RULED THAT YOU MAY NOT AND LET. TO REGULATE DIRECTLY WHAT YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO REGULATE AND DIRECTLY. INDIRECTLY. I DON'T THINK I'M SORRY LET ME REPEAT THAT. THE US SUPREME COURT HAS IN FACT RULED THAT YOU MAY NOT REGULATE INDIRECTLY WHAT YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO REGULATE DIRECTLY SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD BE PREEMPTED IN THIS SPACE SOUTH SOUTH. AND BUT IF I COULD ASK FOR SOME CLARIFICATION -- MISTER DEVINE SPOKE ABOUT THE AMENDMENT THAT SUGGESTED ANY ANALYSIS WE WERE TALKING BRIEFLY ABOUT ANOTHER SET OF POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS AND I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE ARE IF THOSE WERE. ADOPTED INTO THE BILL. YEAH I BELIEVE THERE'S A OUR COPY OF THE MOCK UP THAT'S BEING CIRCULATED THERE. ARE THE CONTENT OF WHICH I READ OFTEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR HEARING. AND IN FACT -- IF I COULD JUST -- TO IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COPY OF THAT AS WELL. DO YOU HAVE IT IN AND OUT. IN FACT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ITEMS SO THAT'S IT CONTAINING THE MARKUP. ADDRESSES SO ONE WOULD ONE OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY MISTER DEVINE EARLIER TO AND THAT'S OF RESPECT TO THE ENTERPRISE SERVICE OFFERING. ARM SO THAT -- ADDRESSED UNDER ON SECTION TO BE. THREE SUB THREE SET A WHICH SAYS IF THE AGENCY SPECIFICALLY REQUIRE SERVICES THAT WOULD NOT BE COMPLAIN WITH SUB SECTIONS SUBDIVISION A TO OUR AND SO WITHOUT THAT YOU MAY CONTINUE WHAT WILL IT JUST A LITTLE BIT. MORE LATER. TO THE AYE I SIMPLY WANT TO CLARIFY WHETHER OR NOT THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN ACT ADOPT A HAVE BEEN LIKE -- DOT TODAY HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY IDEA ABOUT THE AUTHOR CORRECT THINKING. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS STEVE CARLSON TO CTIA FOR WIRELESS A TRADE ASSOCIATION -- LIKE TO ADD THAT -- IN IN THE PRESENTATION TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER HOLIDAY BEING A BLOCKING THROTTLING AND PAID PRIORITIZATION. WHICH ESSENTIALLY ARE THE THREE PILLARS OF THE OBAMA TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER ON S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO GOES MILES BEYOND THAT. DEALS WITH ISSUES LIKE ZERO RATING INTERCONNECTION AND NOW. WE ARE ADDING ANOTHER L. TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER AND EFFECTIVE PROCUREMENT. SO THESE ARE THREE ELEMENTS THAT GO AGAIN WELL BEYOND. WHAT OF THIS COMMITTEE? THE INDOOR STE -- DE BACK IN THAT BACK IN JULY AND AND AND SINCE THESE TWO BILLS ARE. PART INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED BUT THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN WE DO ALSO THINK THAT THE BIG. BECAUSE OF GREAT CONFUSION. HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE STATE AGENCIES WHO ARE. CERTAINLY NOT AN EXPERT IN WHAT IS NET NEUTRALITY WHAT IS NETWORK YOU KNOW HOW THE NETWORKS WORK. MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER YOU KNOW COMPANY A MAY OR MAY NOT BE. A COMPLY BUT THAT TO TRAVEL THE RULES OR OR COMPANY BE MAY OR MAY NOT BE COMPLY BUT THAT DO TO YOU CHARLIE ROSE SO WE THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THE VAN DOOR THEN THE RELATIONSHIP AND IN CALIFORNIA CAN BE YEAH SIGNIFICANTLY AND NEGATIVELY AFFECTED YET IN THAT RESPECT SO. UP BEFORE OUT FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD RECOMMEND NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN RESULT BE BRIEF MY NAME'S JOHN DORY I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE SOCIO XIN OF CALIFORNIA -- WE THINK THAT -- THE STATE DECIDING. THE TYPE. PROGRAM THEY WANT TO HAVE. APPROPRIATE -- POLICY DECISION. BUT WE ARE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE OF THE LINKAGE TO EIGHT TWO TWO WHICH HAS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WHICH ULTIMATELY MEANS IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT COMPLIANCE WITH NET NEUTRALITY IS -- IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE THE FCC WHICH IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION GIVING OUT RULES AND REGULATIONS IT'S ANOTHER TO DEPUTISE. PRIVATE -- FOR PROFIT LAW FIRMS TO LITIGATE ON AND DETERMINE WHAT IS COMPLIANT AND NOT COMPLIANT. AND WHEN YOU TRY TO THEN MAKE THE AGENCIES DETERMINE COMPLIANCE IN THAT -- YOU KNOW CONE OF CONFUSION -- YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HELP THE CONSUMER YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE STATE TO CONTINUE -- TO NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS AND YOU WILL YOU MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR PROVIDERS TO FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THERE THE FOLLOWING THE POLICY WISHES SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE ON THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF EDITION AWARENESS IS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. AND IDENTIFY YOURSELF PLEASE -- THE ORGANIZATION IN YOUR POSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SARAH BOOT FROM CAL CHAMBER IN OPPOSITION IT TOO MUCH NEXT PLACE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM LOW BROWN BEHALF OF SPRINT IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE.

MOBILE ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT OF ITS WAY BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M MISTER OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF SENATOR YOU AND I HAD A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BILL YESTERDAY. I I WAS EXCITED TO READ THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU PROPOSED IN HOPES THAT MAYBE THEY'D ADDRESSED MY CONCERNS BUT UNFORTUNATELY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY HAPPEN SO JUST REITERATE THAT YOU ARE EXCITED YOU WORKS AND I RENTALS IN MAMMOTH I'VE -- YOU KNOW I'D I'D I QUESTION WHETHER NOT THIS BILL IS NECESSARY YOU DID ARGUE REDUNDANCY. PAY TWENTY TWO SAYS THAT NO INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER. MAY OFFER INTERNET SERVICE TO CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT COMPLYING WITH THESE PROVISIONS. AND YOUR BILL SAYS THAT. THEY CAN'T OFFER IT TO ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY. AND YOU SPECIFICALLY REFERENCE. SENATE BILL EIGHT TWENTY TWO AM MAKE YOUR BILL CONTINGENT ON THE ITS ENACTMENT SO IT'S ALMOST AS IF. SOMEONE'S GOT A BILL THAT SAYS NO ONE CAN WEAR A GREEN HAT PARA WOULD KNOW WHAT TO WEAR A HAT AND YOU HAVE A BILL THAT SAYS NO ONE CAN WEAR A GREEN HAT. AND YOU'RE CLAIMING IT'S A SEPARATE VILLAGE OF JUST QUESTIONING THE NEED FOR THE BILL. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT THIS THIS MEASURE RIGHT HERE YOU ARE IS TIED TO A SENATE BILL EIGHT TWO TWO SYMBOL A TWO TWO HAS BEEN ACTIVE INTO LAW OBVIOUSLY SIDE. OF BY THE GOVERNOR IF IN FACT IT DOES PASS -- THE ASSEMBLY AND COMES BACK FOR CONCURRENCE. NOTE TO THE SENATE. SUITABLE FOR SIXTY EXCLUSIVE FOCUS. HE'S ON STATE AGENCIES ANALYSTS AGENCIES ALONE. NOT ON THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER -- DOES ARE NOT. CAPTURED IN THE LARGER. A TWENTY TWO A DEALING WITH DE NET NEUTRALITY POLICY DEALING WITH ROWLING SLOWING DOWN BLOCKING EXOTICS. YESTERDAY I WAS WE HAD A DEEP ROBUST LONG DEBATES ON ON THE ISSUES I WANT REVISITED AGAIN. THIS MEASURE HERE FOR SIXTIES EXCLUSIVE FOCUS IS JUST ON YET ISPS WHO HAVE. A CONTRACTS WITH STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IF THEY DON'T MEET THE NET NEUTRALITY PRINCIPLES AS YOU CORRECTLY STATE. THIS TIED. TO EIGHT TWENTY TO ADD THAN THOSE CONTRACTS WILL EITHER BE PROHIBITED WILL BE TERMINATED ALTOGETHER. THAT WILL FUND FALL IN THE GUISE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA WILL MAKE THAT DETERMINATION OR HIS STAFF WILL MAKE THAT DETERMINATION IF THERE'S COMPLIANCE OR NO COMPLAINTS OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS CONTINGENT ON THE ENACTMENT OF A I TO KNOW FOR SIXTY OKAY SO -- LUDLUM ASK QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY. SO WOULDN'T AN I SP ALREADY BE PRESCRIBED. FROM OFFERING INTERNET SERVICE IN THE STATE IF THEY DIDN'T COMPLY WITH A TWENTY TWO I THINK THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THEY COULD OFFER INTERNET SERVICE TO A STATE GOVERNMENT AND NOT COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF A EIGHT TO TWO WITH INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. SO YOU DON'T YOU THINK THAT THEY WOULD. THEY CAN DO THAT WITHOUT. OF BEING NON COMPLIANT WITH A TWENTY TWO I THINK THAT IS A POSSIBILITY HAVING WE WIN IS I KNOW IT'S A PART OF A OF A OF A LARGER JUST DISCUSSION DEBATE WITH REGARDS TO ONE OF THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND THE I WANT TO SAY THAT THE ACCUSATION OR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THROTTLING -- WITH IN THIS CASE SANTA CLARA FIREFIGHTERS -- IN THE MENTAL -- MEDICINE A LAKE -- KOMPLEKS FIRE IN LAKE COUNTY NOW THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF INTO INTERPRETATION. OF WHETHER IT WAS A CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUE OR IF THIS WAS IN FACT THROTTLING I CAN SEE. WITH POSITION. OF WHAT IT WHAT'S BUT THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN THIS WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO PREVENT WITH FOUR SIXTY SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO STATE GOVERNMENT AND STATE AGENCIES ARE AND ARE NOT GOING TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT I I JUST DON'T SEE. THE NECESSITY FOR THIS BILL GIVEN THE FACT THAT EIGHT TWENTY TO ARE TO EXIST SO RESPECTFULLY ALL BE IN OPPOSITION. FULL A TWENTY TWO DOES EXIST IN PRINCIPLE RIGHT NOW THROUGH THE THAT THE MEASURE ITSELF IT'S I COULD FIGHT. IT SUCKS STATUTORY LAW SURE I'M AWARE OF THAT BUT IF IT DOES NOT BECOME LAW THEN THIS BILL IS ALSO MOOD BECAUSE YOUR BILL IS CONTINGENT ON THE NET IS GOING TO HELP YOU OUT SO QUICK. ALRIGHT. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I BELIEVE THERE WAS THE ISSUE RAISED REGARDING THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN THAT SO THE BILL'S GOING. TO IMPOSE ON STATE AGENCIES ARE. ON IT IN UNDER THE ARE THE NEW SET OF AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE THAT ISSUE IS SAID DR STE. IT TO SOME EXTENT BECAUSE INSTEAD OF HAVING THE STATE AGENCY DO AND DOING THE CERTIFICATION IT'S THE BURDEN IS NOW ON THE ISPS. ARE THAT ARE REQUIRED TO SELF CERTIFY BEFORE THE GET TO BE SELECTED BY THIS I THINK IN IN MANY WAYS THAT KINDA MEDICAID SEE THE BURDEN SO SPEAKER ON ON THE PART OF THE AGENCY. IF IT'S A QUESTION OF FAITH AND TRUST WITH A SELF CERTIFICATION PROCESS [inaudible] YOU'RE CORRECT. SO IT ON THE INTERNET. IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OVER OR QUESTIONS I'M GOING HOUSE TO SENATOR TO CLOSE CHIU MAJA I'LL TAKE THAT AS MY CLOTHES THANK YOU MUCH. THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS.
