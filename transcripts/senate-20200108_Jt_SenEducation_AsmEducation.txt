AN ESTEEMED SENATE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS RILEY MORE AT AND I'M A SENIOR AT GRANADA HIGH SCHOOL. I AM ALSO THE STUDENT BOARD REPRESENTATIVE ON THE LIVER MORE JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. OF ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SIXTEEN AND SENATE DISTRICT SEVEN. MY NAME IS LIZ HIS RODRIGUEZ I AM A SENIOR KERR IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THE STUDENT BORDER PRESENTED A FOR THE CRIME UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THIRTY ONE AND SENATE DISTRICT TWELVE. MY NAME IS OLIVER FRENCH I'M A JUNIOR AT CREDO HIGH IN THE COULD HADI VOTER PARK UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I AM REPRESENTING ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FOUR AND SENATE DISTRICT TO. AS INVOLVED MEMBER OF MY STUDENT COUNCIL AND SUPPORTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY SPECIFICALLY IN SCHOOLS. I AM GRATEFUL TO BE HERE AND LIKE TO THANK THE STEAM TO SENATE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR PROVIDING THIS PLATFORM FOR STUDENTS TO USE THEIR VOICE. AND SPEAK UP IN TODAY'S POLITICAL CLIMATE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER FOR THE CITIZENS TO SPEAK UP AND FIGHT FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE AND- THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT CLIMATE CRISIS AND TO FIGHT FOR A BETTER FUTURE. ACCORDING TO THE WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION SEE LEVELS CONTINUE TO RISE. WILD FIRES IN HER TEENS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE INTENSE AND OUR PLAN IS ONLY GETTING HOTTER. AS SEEN IN COUNTLESS CLIMATE STRIKES AND MARCHES ACROSS THE GLOBE PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING SUBSTANTIAL STRUCTURAL CHANGE NOTABLY. OUR GENERATION OF STUDENTS HAVE MOBILIZED AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE OFTENTIMES SHOWING MORE PASSION FOR THE ISSUE THEN THE ELECTED MEMBERS OF THEIR GOVERNMENTS. ON MARCH FIFTEENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OVER A MILLION STUDENTS WORLDWIDE WALKED OUT OF THEIR SCHOOLS IN PROTEST. WITH THIS MUCH ACTIVISM COMING FROM THE YOUTH ONE WOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE SCHOOLS. BUT CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE DOING LITTLE TO PROMOTE OR ENSURE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. AS A RESULT IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE EXPERIENCED THE EFFECTS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS FIRSTHAND DROUGHT TO MADE WATER CONSERVATION MORE VITAL THAN EVER. AND WILD FIRES HAVE SWEPT ACROSS OUR STATE CAUSING IMMEASURABLE DAMAGE. TO HOMES BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES. I MYSELF HAVE BEEN EVACUATED BECAUSE OF THE FIRES. AND IT'S A SCARY FEELING NOT KNOWING IF I CAN COME HOME. MY SCHOOL IS ALSO BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR DAYS AT A TIME. DUE TO POOR AIR QUALITY. BECAUSE DURING THE FIRE SEASON WHEN THE GRASS IS DRY AND THE WINDS ARE UNUSUALLY STRONG. I LIVE IN FEAR. MY FAMILY LIVES IN FEAR. MY FRIENDS WHO HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR HOMES LIVE IN FEAR. BUT I REFUSED TO LET THIS CONTINUE SO I'M HERE. I'M FIGHTING FOR CHANGE. OUR PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS FUNDING TO ADDRESS THIS CLIMATE CRISIS THROUGH THE EXISTING FUNDS. SUPPLIED BY THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD EVERY YEAR THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD DISTRIBUTE 86% OF ITS FUNDING TO THE MODERNIZATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOL FACILITIES FAST WE PROPOSE THE GOVERNING BOARDS OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO APPLY FOR FUNDING. THROUGH THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD FOR A SCHOOL MODERNIZATION PROJECT OR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT AFTER THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE MUST AS A PART OF THE SUBSEQUENT MODERNIZATIONS OR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT INCLUDE LOW FLOW WATER AERATORS AND LED LIGHTS. WATER AERATORS ARE THE SMALL METAL PARTS PLACED ON THE END OF FAUCETS THAT LOOK LIKE MESH SCREENS WATER AERATORS BREAK UP THE FLOW OF WATER INTO MULTIPLE SMALL STREAMS ADDING AIR IN BETWEEN WHICH ULTIMATELY REDUCES WATER USAGE WITHOUT ACTUALLY AFFECTING THE WATER SURE. CURRENTLY THE MAJORITY OF FAUCETS CONTAIN AERATORS IS TWO POINT TWO GALLONS OF WATER PER MINUTE. LOW FLOW WATER AIRDATE AERATORS WOULD BE THOSE CHARACTERIZED. AS THE ONES THAT ONLY USE ABOUT POINT FIVE TWO ONE GALLONS GALLONS OF WATER PER MINUTE. THESE TOOLS ARE BOTH BENEFICIAL AND LOW COST AS THE AVERAGE AERATOR IS ONLY ONE DOLLAR ACCORDING TO THE HOME WATER WORKS ORGANIZATION. ADDITIONALLY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LED LIGHTS IS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT BUT RELATIVELY LOW COST SUSTAINABILITY PROJECT. LED LIGHTS YOU 75% LESS ENERGY AND THEY LASTS TWENTY FIVE TIMES LONGER THAN TRADITIONAL FLUORESCENT BULBS. WHILE THE INITIAL COST OF INSTALLING LED LIGHTS IS RELATIVELY SUBSTANTIAL IT IS A SIZEABLE LONG TERM INVESTMENT. THIS PROPOSAL IS A DIRECT PATH FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS TO INCREASE THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN COMBATING THE CLIMATE CRISIS WITHOUT DEMANDING ANY NEW FUNDING PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY THIS LEGISLATIVE APPROACH TO THE ADDRESS TO ADJUSTING THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARDS FUNDING GUIDELINES IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED. THIS PROPOSAL WAS BASED IN PART ON ASSEMBLY BILL THREE TWO ZERO FIVE WHICH WAS AUTHORED BY CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL. AND APPROVED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ASSEMBLY BILL THREE TWO ZERO FIVE PURSUED THE SAME STRATEGY BUT FOR ACQUIRING PREVENTATIVE ACTOR SHOOTER ACTIVE SHOOTER DOOR LOCKS. IN ADDITION ASSEMBLY BILL FORTY EIGHT FOUR TWENTY TWENTY ALSO AUTHORED BY CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AUTHORIZED BUT DID NOT REQUIRE THE USE OF MODERNIZATION AND CONSTRUCTION FOR. ON OURS ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL SAFETY PROJECTS. BOTH SEEKING FUNDING OPTIONS FOR THESE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS WE HAVE BEEN LIMITED IN BUILDING A PATH TO COMPREHENSIVE CLIMATE ACTION AND IMPLEMENTING CLIMATE JUSTICE OUR PROPOSAL IS A STEP TOWARDS MEETING THESE GOALS I'M ALL TOO MANY CREATE IMMEDIATE AND FORESEEABLE RESULTS. BUT IT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE THE EXTENSIVE AFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SB FORMULATED THE OUTLINE FOR A PROPOSAL WE FIRST DEVELOPED A STRATEGY TO LEGISLATIVE THE MANDATE FUNDING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS. HOWEVER IT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THE STATE COULD NOT DIRECTLY IMPORTS FUNDING RESTRICTIONS ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR STATE. THEN WE LOOKING TO AMENDING THE LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN BUT WE REALIZE THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE ITS CURRENT FORMATTING ALSO WE WERE INFORMED OF THE ORGANIZATION LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN CERTIFICATION BUT VERY FEW SCHOOLS ARE CERTIFIED DO NOT CALL LIST. SO OFTEN WE HAVE ADDRESSED TO CHU WAS BY MET THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MODERNIZATION I NEW CONSTRUCTION GRANTS PROVIDED THE LOCATION BOARD. WE WANT TO EXPLICITLY EXPRESSED THE FACT THE INCREMENTAL CHANGE IS NOT FEASIBLE IN SUBSTANTIALLY DIMINISHING THE DRASTIC CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT WE MUST RECTIFIER LOCK OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY. IF WE DO NOT DO EVERYTHING TO REVERSE THE REPERCUSSIONS WE WILL REST SETTING OFF IRREVERSIBLE CHAIN REACTIONS BEYOND HUMAN CONTROL. AS HUMANS WE MUST SECURE OUR SURVIVAL. AND ITS PERFORMANCE WE MUST TAKE THE NECESSARY. UPS FORCED INTO THE DIRECTION OUR PROPOSAL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR SCHOOLS IMPROVE THEIR SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS BUT IT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH TO FULLY RESOLVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE AS YOUTH WHO HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH THE CLIMATE CRISIS NEED YOU TO UNDERSERVED UNDERSTAND THE MONUMENTAL GRAVITY AND URGENCY OF THE ISSUE. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE TAKE BOLD PROGRESSIVE ACTION ON ALL FRONTS TO BUILD A FUTURE THAT IS BOTH SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE FOR ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME WE ARE NOT OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS GREAT THANK YOU WILL VERY WELL DONE VERY WELL PRESENTED FOR SURE VERY WILL RESEARCH THE THANK YOU FOR THAT- I JUST HAVE A FEW. QUESTIONS INCOME ALL INTERMINGLED THEM- I APPRECIATE THE REALLY DUG INTO THE WEEDS HERE TALK ABOUT THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD BECAUSE I IMAGINE YOU COULD FIND A LOT OF LEGISLATORS IN THIS BUILDING WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE STATE ALLOCATION BORDERS- BUT THAT'S A BOARD I SAID ON ACTUALLY- SO I HAVE A SPECIFIC INTEREST IN SCHOOL FACILITIES HAVING BEEN A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER FOR A LONG TIME IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. I SAID SO YOU'RE ASKING FOR MONEY FROM THE STATE ALLOCATION WAS THAT CORRECT. I'M WHAT WE'RE ASKING TO DO IS THAT- WHEN PEOPLE RECEIVE THE GRANT FROM THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO USE A PORTION OF THAT GRANT MONEY ON LED LIGHTS. AND WATER AERATORS OKAY. OKAY I AND I UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BETTER NOW- IT LED LIGHTS A WATER AREAS WHERE THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANTED TO ADD. I KNOW THOSE FOR THE TO SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS THAT WERE A LOW COST BUT ALSO SEEM TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OKAY I UNDERSTAND. THANK YOU SENATOR. IT SOUNDS YOU DID A GREAT PRESENTATION- IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD. FOR YOU KNOW NOBODY TO OBJECT TO. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS YOUR OPPOSITION'S STRONGEST ARGUMENT WHAT SHOULD WE BE READY FOR. THAT COULD BE. VOICE TO YOU AND SAY NO WE CAN'T DO IT FOR THIS REASON WHAT'S THE STRONGEST OPPOSITION ARGUMENT ON THE QUESTION IT COULD BE THAT- POTENTIALLY MOST DISTRICTS WOULD SEEK MORE GRANT MONEY AND SO THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE TO THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE TO EVERY DISTRICT WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE TO ASK FOR MORE GRANT MONEY AND EVENTUALLY THERE WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH FOR MORE SCHOOLS TO RECEIVE MONEY SO IT WOULD BE. A LITTLE LESS DIFFERENT IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT TO GIVE EVERYONE GRANT MONEY I'M NOT SURE IF THIS ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION AS WELL BUT I'VE NOTICED THROUGH ATTENDING THIS CONFERENCE THAT A LOT OF SCHOOLS ON. DO NOT. WE SHARE THEY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN SACRAMENTO IMPOSES A AMANDA A OR LIKE A STATEWIDE REGULATION ALL SCHOOLS THEY PREFER TO WORK THINGS OUT A LOCAL LEVEL SO WHENEVER I ASSUME THAT LIKE WHENEVER SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS PROPOSED WHERE IT'S A. REQUIREMENT FOR SCHOOL STATEWIDE I SURE I ASSUME IS GONNA BE SOME BACKLASH TO THAT. THAT'S BOTH AGREE POINTS IN THAT- THAT IS ONE OF THINGS I WORRY ABOUT IN THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD AS WE PASSED DOWN NEW REQUIREMENTS MAKE NEW REGULATIONS SHE WAS THE COST BURDEN ON A LOCAL DISTRICTS AND YOU POINTED OUT. THAT I NEVER LIKE THIS MIGHT START EATING UP MORE MONEY BUT I ALSO NOTICE HERE PRESIDENT WHO WERE VERY CAREFUL- TO CITED THIS IS. ACTUALLY PRETTY EFFECTIVE USE OF MONEY AND NOT GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF MONEY SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT UP I ALSO APPRECIATE YOU RECOGNIZING THAT THE MORE BURDENS MANDATES WE DO PUT ON LEVELS. THE MORE IT IT. IT. IT EATS UP MONEY AND THERE'S NOT MONEY FOR THAT NEXT PROJECTS THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL IT'S ALWAYS A BALANCE UP HERE. IT'S ALWAYS A BOUNCE. SO I THOUGHT- YOUR IDEAS WERE. PRETTY WELL THOUGHT OUT- IN FACT I HAVE THE CHIEF FACILITIES EXPERT THE CAPITAL WORKING IN MY OFFICE RIGHT NOW LISTENING RIGHT NOW. WHO SAT ON THIS COMMITTEE AS A AS A CONSULTANT FOR MANY YEARS- WHO'S PROBABLY TAKING NOTES SO THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD- WITHOUT ANY FURTHER SENATOR. WELL I THINK THAT YOU- YOU COVERED A LOT OF GROUND I THINK YOU HIT THAT. HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHEN YOU SAID. EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR FUNDING. SO YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A BIG ARGUMENT APPEAR. ON AND ALSO WILL STILL HAVE AN IMPACT. IN SUPPORT OF A- CLEANER AND ENVIRONMENT SO. I THINK YOU DID DEEPER HOMEWORK THAN JUST WHAT WAS PRESIDENT HERE. YOU DID MUCH DEEPER THINKING SO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU CAN CAN ONE AREA THAT COULD BE ADDRESS UNDER THE YOU DIDN'T BRING UP- BUT I THINK YOU DIDN'T BRING IT UP FOR A REASON AND THEY GIVE CITED IS THAT. THE VERY EXPENSIVE I'LL I AS I LOOK AT SCHOOLS I DRIVE AROUND THE- THE TOWN I'LL LOOK AT AREAS WHERE THERE'S GRASS. WHERE THERE NEED NOT BE GRASS WHEN I ME THAT LIKE BETWEEN CLASSROOMS ARE KIDS DON'T PLAY- IN WHAT IS THAT MEAN TO ME. THE WAY I LOOK AT FACILITIES THAT MEANS MAINTENANCE THAT'S A LOT OF MAINTENANCE DOLLARS. WERE SOME THAT GRASS IN MY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE COULD BE TAKEN UP IN A- MAYBE SOME MORE- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA FRIENDLY. VEGETATION COULD BE PLANTED IN THERE BECAUSE IT WOULD SAY WATER FOR SURE. THE CUT DOWN ON MAINTENANCE THOUGH I MEAN KNOWN HAVE TO MOW IT EVERY WEEK AND WOOD AND ONCE A MONTH SOMEONE GOES THROUGH THEIR DOES SOME BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT. AND I CAN BE PRETTY COST EFFECTIVE IN THE LONG RUN FOR SCHOOLS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT EVEN ON THEIR OWN THEY DON'T EVEN NEED AN INCENTIVE TO. IN FACT. I THINK ON THE RELEASE OF THEIR OWN COST BURDENS FOR THAT'S ANOTHER TOPIC WE WILL CONTINUE TODAY. BUT I WON THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. VERY WELL THE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. NEXT WE HAVE. TO BE TO BE FAIR I DON'T ALLOW CLAPPING IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM BUT WE DO TODAY SO. IT'S NOT A SPORTING EVENT AS I WAS AND- ANYWAYS BUT POLITICS IS KIND OF A SPORTS SOMETIMES CORRECT SENATOR- WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM SCHOOL OR SCHOOL SCHOOL SAFETY TEAM. COME ON UP TO TAKE A SEAT INTRODUCE YOURSELVES AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL- GOOD AFTERNOON ASKING COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THINK EVERY TIME TODAY I'M JONATHAN HOLE FROM THE ONE OF ALL UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I'M IN THE FIFTY FIFTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND THE TWENTY NINE SENATE-DISTRICT. MY NAME IS EMILY FROM FULLERTON JOINT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS SIXTY FIVE AND SENATE DISTRICT TWENTY NINE. MY NAME IS BRADLEY RAMZI FROM ANDERSON UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT ONE AND SENATE-DISTRICT ONE I'M ALSO SHOWS COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION STUDENT BOARD MEMBER. RIGHT. OVER HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE SCHOOL SAFETY PROCEDURES AND EMERGENCY READINESS. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS DEFINITELY MADE GREAT LEAPS IN ENSURING THAT SCHOOLS ARE PREPARED FOR ADVERSE CONDITIONS AND BY WAS INSTALLATIONS OF FOR EXAMPLE THANKS TO AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN OF HOUSING TWENTY EIGHTEEN. OUR EDUCATION CODE SECTION THREE TWO TWO EIGHT TWO NOW HOLD EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT AND LOCAL COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION RESPONSIBLE. FOR DEVELOPING COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS. OF TODAY WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE IN ADDITION ACTUALLY TO THAT SECTION SECTION THREE TWO TWO EIGHT TWO OF THIS. EDUCATION CODE- YES AT THE SECTION ALSO REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO CREATE A SAFETY PROTOCOL TO ADDRESS THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER. PULLING A FIRE ALARM AS A WEAPON TO LOWER STUDENTS OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. I LIKE TO BRING US BACK TO VALENTINE'S DAY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE DAY OF THE MARCH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN PARKLAND FLORIDA. THE SHOOTING STARTED AN ALARM WENT OFF AND- EVERYTHING WASIN DISARRAY SHOULD WE EVACUATE OR SHOULD WE HIGH END STAGE CHILDREN IN THE CLASSROOM. WE LOST SEVENTEEN LIVES THAT DAY WHEN THE SHOOTER TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE CONFUSION BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL EVACUATION IN THE FINAL LOCKDOWN CONSENSUS. STUDENTS RUN AROUND IN CHAOS UNABLE TO DECIDE WHICH SET OF INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOW EVACUATE BECAUSE THE ALARM OR- LOCK DOWN BECAUSE OF A SCHOOL THREAT. THIS TRAGEDY SHOWS AN INHERENT ISSUE IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND OUR REACTION- PROCEDURES WITH FELL TO CONFIRM ALERTS OR ALARMS BEFORE WE ACT. THE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES OUR EFFICIENCY AND AGGRAVATE THE FEAR AND TENSION INHERENT IN OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM. HOW MANY STUDENTS DO YOU THINK WOULD STILL BE ALIVE TODAY IF WE DIDN'T MATTER IMMEDIATELY EVACUATE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE THREAT OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS DOES NOT AFFECT EVERY SIN IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER WAS SCHOOLS BECOMING THE MOST COMMON LOCATION WORK ACTIVE SHOOTINGS OCCUR IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO UP THE PERSON MERGING SEE PROTOCOLS WE HAVE IN PLACE. THE PARKLAND SHOOTING HIGHLIGHTS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. A FIRE ALARM LOWER THE STUDENTS OUTSIDE OF THE SAFETY OF THEIR CLASSROOM. THE PROBLEMS CLEAR WE'RE NOT YEAH EQUIPPED TO CONSIDER EVERY DANGER AND AS WE'VE SEEN THIS INSUFFICIENCY HAS TAKEN FAR TOO MANY LIVES. WHEN APPROACHING THIS ISSUE WE BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA VERY GREATLY FROM ACCESSIBILITY TO ACCESSIBILITY TO EMERGENCY RESOURCES TO ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITATIONS. THEREFORE THIS IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION. RATHER IT IS A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO BE HELD LOCALLY. ALL DISTRICTS SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS WHAT THE RISING FREQUENCY OF ACTIVE SHOOTER THREATS WE NEED TO REFORM THE SYSTEM NOW. CURRENTLY IMMEDIATE ACTUATION IS THE MOST COMMON RESPONSE TO A FIRE ALARM HOWEVER THIS DOES EVACUATION CAN BE USED AS A TOOL BY ACTIVE SHOOTERS FULLER STUDENTS OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. THUS WE PROPOSE THAT UNDER EDUCATION CODE THREE TWO TWO EIGHT TWO. DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED TO CREATE A SAFETY PROCEDURE PLAN IN THE INSTANCE OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER USING A FIRE ALARM. WE LEAVE. WE LEAVE THE SPECIFICS OF THESE EMERGENCY PLANS UP TO THE DISTRICTS LOT DEPENDING ON THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY CAN TAILOR THE BEST SOLUTIONS POSSIBLE. FOR INSTANCE A FIRE PRONE AREA WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO POSTPONE EVACUATION WHEREAS IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR AN AREA WITH MORE GUN VIOLENCE SUPPOSED WHEN EVACUATION. TRAGEDY SUCH AS THE PARK WHEN SHOOTING COULD. COULD HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED SORRY. WE RESTART TRAGEDY SUCH AS THE PARK ON SHOOTING COULD HAVE BEEN MITIGATED OR PREVENTED WITH NEW POLICIES FOR EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS. THE SAFETY PROTOCOLS THAT ARE PROPOSAL REQUIRES OF DISTRICTS ARE CURRENTLY IN PRACTICE BY SEVERAL SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND COLORADO. WHENEVER FILL SABLE DELEGATES FROM SHOTS UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT ONE SENATE-DISTRICT ONE IS AN EXAMPLE OF WATER PROPOSAL WHICH IS TO ACCOMPLISH. ACCORDING TO THEIR NEW PROCEDURES THE DISTRICT NOW GOES INTO A LOCKDOWN WHEN AN EMERGENCY ALARM IS ACTIVATED. THIS PROTECTS THE STUDENTS IN THE SPECIFIC CASE OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER PULLING THE FIRE ALARM. THIS LOCKDOWN PROCEDURE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE AS TO HOW IMPLEMENTING THE NEW SAFETY PROCEDURES MAKES THE SCHOOLS SAFER FOR OUR MODERN EMERGENCIES. THIS FURTHER PROVES A NECESSITY FOR OUR PROPOSAL TO BE APPROVED IN ORDER TO REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT SAFER MERGING SEE STRATEGIES. THIS PROTOCOL IS A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF WHAT OUR PROPOSAL WISHES TO ACCOMPLISH BUT AGAIN IS IN NO WAY THE SUB STANDARD. NO ONE. CAN PUT A PRICE ON THE VALUE OF LIFE. THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF STATISTICS FOR POLITICS IT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT WE PROTECT OUR STUDENTS THEY ARE THE FUTURE AND THEIR SAFETY NOT ONLY DETERMINES THE WELL BEING OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO THE WELFARE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND WE HOPE YOU CONSIDER A PROVISION TO ENACT A SAFER SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT WE NOW OPEN THE FLOOR TO ANY COMMENTS CONCERNS OR QUESTIOS. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO I DIDN'T LEAVE ME UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR ASK FOR AN ESTABLISHED PROTOCOL IN A SCHOOL WHERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT HAPPEN ARE YOU ASKING FORCE. A TYPE OF BELL THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN A FIRE BELL WITH THAT SO WE'RE ASKING FOR DISTRICTS TO CREATE A PROTOCOL- IN THE SITUATION OF A ACTIVE SHOOTER HOLDING THE FIRE ALARM WHICH LOWERS STUDENTS OUT A CLASSROOM WHICH IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERNS OKAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING READ AND- MANY A LOCK ON MYSELF OKAY SOME RIGHT BY WAS A MONTH FOR FIVE HOURS ONCE AND IT IT BY TALIBAN A LOCKDOWN VERY INTERESTING AND. SCARY EXPERIENCE BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HEAR HELLO THERE'S OUTSIDE YOUR- AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR SIRENS. NO IS YOU NEED TO TURN OFF THE LIGHTS LOCKED THE DOOR DROPPED THE- CAN'T CONTROL ANYTHING IS GOING ON OUTSIDE THAT ROOM BUT YOU HEAR IT GOING ON. SO IT'S A VERY IT'S A VERY SCARY EXPERIENCE FOR YOURSELF BUT ALSO YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW THIRTY FIVE PLUS SOMETIMES STUDENTS TO PROTECT AND RECOGNIZE- SO- I. I CAN APPRECIATE A LOCKDOWN FOR SURE I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT HAVING BEEN THROUGH MANY MYSELF. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT PROTOCOL MIGHT LOOK LIKE I AM A SCHOOL PRINCIPAL FOR. WHAT WHAT WHAT OR AT SCHOOL BOARD WHAT KIND OF POLICY WHAT I DEVELOP WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE. AT MY SCHOOL SITE. ON WHAT I DO SO THE EXAMPLE THAT WE HAVE IS THREE SHOTS UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT THE WAY IN WHICH STATE RUN THEIR PROTOCOL IS WHEN THE FIRE ALARM SOUNDS- TEACHERS AND STUDENTS HAD IN THE CLASSROOMS TEACHERS. AS THEY ARE LOCKING THE DOOR LOOK OUTSIDE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NEW STUDENTS OUTSIDE THEY ALSO DO. AND SMELL WITH A VISUAL TRANSCEIVER CAN SEE FIRE OR IF THEY CAN SMELL SMOKE IN THAT CASE IF THERE IS THEY THEN CONTACT ADMINISTRATION WHO THAT PUTS US AT LEAST TWO TIRES. AND LET THEM KNOW THAT AND YOU HAVE EVERY BACK AT THAT POINT. OTHERWISE IF THEY SMELL NO SMOKE SEE NO FIRE THEY ARE IN A LOCK DOWN PROCEDURE INTEL OTHERWISE NOTIFIED BY THE SCHOOL. THAT IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE- THAT IS NOT OUR DIRECT PROTOCOL BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU WANT TO LEAVE THIS UP TO THE DISTRICT THEMSELVES TO THE SIDE. LIKE YOUR LOCAL CONTROL ASPECT FOR SURE BECAUSE OUR DISTRICTS ARE DIFFERENT SCHOOL DIFFERENT IN A SAM IN THE HIGH SCHOOL IN OTHER STUDENTS FROM THAT WELL AS A HUGE PLACE THAT IS A REAL BIG PLACE IN THAT BRITAIN DIFFERENT DYNAMIC. I JUST SEEMS. COUNTER IN THE FAR ALARM GOES OFF RUN INTO MY CLASS. THIS WONDERING GOD. I'M SO THAT IS WORD SAYING. SO WALL OF FIRE ALARM TYPICALLY GOES OFF WERE USED TO RUNNING AWAY. THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT OF WE WANT SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM- FOR WHEN THE FIRE ALARMS PULLED AS IF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER WERE TO PULL IT. UP BECAUSE YOU WANT THEM TO ASSUME AN ACTIVE SHOOTER HAS PULLED ATTRACTIVE. YES OR ELSE- YOU JUST BE RUNNING OUT OF DANGER AND NOT KNOWING IT. SO THIS IS LETTING THEM FIGURE OUT OKAY DID AN ACTIVE SHOOTER JUST PULL THIS ALARM. DO WE RUN OUTSIDE BECAUSE IT IS A FIRE OR DID AN ACTIVE SHOOTER PULLS ALARM SO WE'RE GOING TO WALK DOWN. THAT'S THE REASON WHY SHASTA HIGH SCHOOL HAS A PROCEDURE TO IMMEDIATELY GOING TO LOCK DOWN. AND THEN INTO EVACUATION. AND TO BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF SCHOOLS WOULD FOLLOW THAT TYPE OF. BALL BUT OF COURSE SB PRINT EACH. OF COURSE HE SEES THIS. THEY SAID YOU CLASS TO. FIRE YOU KNOW ONE GOING BACK IN. YOU ARE THE MANY OTHERS YOU I'M. OKAY I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK THIS YEAR BECAUSE I GET I GET I GET YOUR POINT THAT SOMEONE COULD PULL THE FIRE ALARM STUDENTS HEAD OUT TO THE FIELD WITH A TYPICALLY LINE UP AND WAVE THE TEACHER COME OUT CALL ROLE. RIGHT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. YEAH AND HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT DYNAMIC I. THINK THIS IS AN INTERESTING. POINT THAT I DON'T REALLY I. THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT QUITE FRANKLY WHAT I'M USED TO HAPPENING. QUITE FRANKLY IS IN IN AS IN A LOCK DOWN SOMEONE GETTING ON THE PA. SAYING LOCKDOWN. LOCKDOWN SAY FIVE TIMES. THAT WAIT FIVE SECONDS AND SAY IT AGAIN. SO EVERYBODY AND EVERYBODY HEARS AND AROUND THE SCHOOL THEY NEED TO REPEAT MULTIPLE TO GET TO SAY ONCE. RIGHT NEEDS TO BE SAID. AND YOU WILL COME ON TEMAS I CONTINUE THE LOCKDOWN. YEAH RIGHT SO. ON WHAT WE'RE KIND OF AIMING FOR IS THAT. THE SCHOOLDISTRICTS CAN DECIDE. HOW THEY WANT TO IMPLEMENTED. SO IF THEY WANTED TO IMPLEMENT. THAT IT. IS AN IMMEDIATE EVACUATION. IT COULD BE AN IMMEDIATE EVACUATION. OR IT COULD BE. IMMEDIATE LOCKDOWN OR- WHATEVER. HAPPY MEDIUM. SIZED BASICALLY WHAT YOU WANT TO SCHOOL DISTRICT TO DO. A SCHOOL BOARD. IS AND THIS WE DO THIS A LOT OF HERE WE SEE WE DIRECTOR SCHOOL. WE DIRECT- LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD. RIGHT AND THERE'S A WHAT A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS A LOT OF THEM. AND THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT. IN GEOGRAPHY. AT SOME. DIFFERENT PLACES. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO DO IT THIS WAY WE HAVE SAY YOU. ADOPT A POLICY. THAT WORKS. FOR YOU. EVEN SCHOOLS ARE. DEFINITELY SOME THE STUDENTS ARE ALL PRETTY MUCH INSIDE SOME. THEY'RE ALL OUTSIDE. SO SOME YOU HAVE TO CROSS STREET. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR APPROACH. IN THAT YOU'RE RECOGNIZING THAT WE ARE. A DIVERSE STATE. IN GEOGRAPHY AND THAT WE SHOULD HANSEL LOCALS. TO DEVELOP THEIR POLICY BUT THAT THEY SHOULD DO BALLOT SUCH A POLICY SO THAT SENATOR. IS WHERE YOU CAN ADD SOMETHING- I WAS JUST GOING TO LIKE TO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT WERE NOT OUR OUR OUR POINT HERE IS TO EMPHASIZE IN THAT SECTION OF THE EDUCATION CODE SECTION TO DO A TO. THAT SECTION EMPHASIZES THE WHAT STUDENTS HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR LIKE FIRES OR YOU CAN WORK- EARTHQUAKES WE'RE NOT SAYING WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WE JUST NEED THEM TO BE AWARE OF THE ABILITY OF THIS AND THAT. AND BE PREPARED NOT EARLY. SAY A LOT AS NECESSARY. SO I HAVE A QUESTION THANK YOU. SOME IN MAKING THAT MAKING THE CASE FOR THIS. ISSUE TO BE INCLUDED WHICH I THINK IS VERY. VERY GOOD OF YOU TO BRING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION- YOU MENTIONED- AGAIN JUST IN MAKING THE CASE THAT THEY WERE- IN THE FIRST FORTY SIX WEEKS OF TWENTY NINETEEN FORTY FIVE SHOOTINGS. AND AT LEAST ONE SCHOOL SHOOTING PER PER WEEK- BUT YOU ONLY MENTIONED- PARKLAND AS AN INCIDENT OF. YOU SAY ON IT THIS INCIDENT DEMONSTRATES THAT FIRE ALARM IS A COMMON WAY. FOR ACTIVE SHOOTERS TO TARGET STUDENTS. OF IS THAT REALLY WHAT YOUR INFORMATION FOUND I OR YOU DIDN'T IT IS SORT OF MATCH UP. THAT PART WITH THE FIRST SET OF FACTS OR INFORMATION SO WHAT WE KIND OF FOUND WAS THAT PARKLAND SHOOTING WAS REALLY A- IT'S BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED COMPARED TO MANY OTHERS HAVE JUST BEEN SAID THERE WAS A SCHOOL SHOOTING THERE WAS THIS MANY VICTIMS THEY DON'T REALLY GO INTO THE FACT OF. HOW IT WENT DOWN OR- WHETHER NOT THE FIRE ALARM WAS PULLED SO IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET THOSE STATISTICS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT A FARMS BEEN TOLD. IN THE FUTURE WE HAVE FOUND THERE IS A SLIGHT MENTIONS OF FIRE ALARMS BEING PULLED BUT WE DO SEE THAT AS A LARGE RISK- WHETHER OR NOT IT IS BEEN SHOWN IS COMMON IN CALIFORNIA. BUT IT SEEMS AS IT'S BECOMING A COMMON THING WITHIN THE UNITED STATES FROM THE STE- DIFFERENT STUDIES THAT WE FOUND. ALSO BEING LIKE SUCH A HIGH PROFILE CASE WE FELT THAT LIKE YOU GUYS WOULD ALREADY HAVE SOME BACKGROUND IN IT RESONATE MORE. AND ALSO THAT LAKE LINK IT TOOK ALL THE WALKOUTS AND HOW LIKE STUDENTS WANT CHANGE NOW. AND REGARDLESS OF THE FREQUENCY OF ACTUALLY USING A FIRE ALARM TO YOUR STUDENTS OUT- IT'S STILL IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S- AN EASILY ADJUSTABLE. AND IT'S NOT AS IN WILL NOT NECESSARILY AFFECT EVERYONE BUT IT'S- EASY STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WELL I THINK WE COULD EMPHASIZE THAT POINT A LOT MORE BECAUSE I THINK YEAR YOU'RE RIGHT ON THAT RIGHT ON ON ON THAT AND- YOU DON'T NEED TO MAKE THE CASE THAT. IT'S COMMON IT'S A COMMON USE NEED TO MAKE THE CASE THAT IT IS USED AND THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE AN ELEMENT IN THE SAFETY PLAN. JUST FOR YOUR FUTURE. THANK YOU SENATOR I WILL THANK YOU VERY WELL PRESENTED AND VERY WELL DONE AND GOOD RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WITH RONNIE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM OUR MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH PANEL. YEAH YOURSELVES AND PROCEED WHEN READY. OKAY THANK GREETINGS CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION. MY. THE JUNIOR OLYMPIANS HIGH SCHOOL IN THE SUIT PARTY UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT I AM PART OF THE SEVENTY NINE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND THE FORTY S. SENATE DISTRICT. SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE THIRTEENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND THE FIFTH SENATE DISTRICT. MY NAME IS SHERRY A WHOLE CARTY I'M A JUNIOR AT GRANITE BAY HIGH SCHOOL IN THE ROSE BOWL JOINT UNIFIED HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND I'M PART OF THE SIX ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND THE FIRST SENATE DISTRICT. WE ARE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS OR CAST TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS WITHIN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION. IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT WELLNESS DEFINED AS THE MINDSET ACTIVITIES AND HABITS WE PRACTICE TO COMBAT STRESS DEPRESSION AND OTHER NEGATIVE MIND STATES IS NOT PRIORITIZE IN THE CURRENT EDUCATION SYSTEM. HOWEVERSOME SCHOOLS HAVE TAKEN INITIATIVE. CASES SUCH AS THE SACRAMENTO BASED LEONARDO DA VINCI PRE K. THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE SCHOOL AND WHICH FOURTH GRADERS SPEND ONE DAY A WEEK SINGING ALONG TO SONGS WELL I EXERCISING TO PROMOTE WELL BEING. AND CREATE A HIGH SCHOOL IN WHICH TEACHERS USE POSITIVE CREATIVE AFFIRMATIONS PRIOR TO TAX A TACTIC WHICH HAS REPORTEDLY TO INCREASE TEST SCORES OVERTIME AND STUDENTS TAKING REQUIRED ART CLASSES. ALLEVIATE STRESS BOTH SHOW THAT WELLNESS TECHNIQUES HAVE WORKED PROMOTING LONG TERM BENEFITS ON MENTAL HEALTH. DO THESE VARIOUS EXERCISES STUDENTS EXPRESSED FEELINGS OF GRATITUDE AND RELIEF HAVING BEEN GIVEN LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT A PLACE IN WHICH STUDENTS ARE USUALLY GEARED TOWARDS STEM CURRICULUM. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY INFORMATION ART STIMULATES THE RELEASE OF DOPAMINE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO FEEL HAPPIER AND GIVING THOSE STRUGGLING WITH ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION A REPRIEVE. HOWEVER IT IS UNDISPUTED BOWLTHAT THE LACK OF THESE EXERCISES OR ANY SIGNIFICANT MEASURE OF NONTRADITIONAL LEARNING WHETHER THAT BE EMOTIONAL OR PHYSICAL CAUSES HARM WITH CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES ACT STATING THAT CHILDREN LEFT UNTREATED OFTEN BECOME UNABLE TO LEARN OR PARTICIPATE IN A NORMAL SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. WELL ASSEMBLY ALL SEVENTEEN SIXTY SEVEN A NEWLY ESTABLISHED BILL APPROVED LAST YEAR EXPLORED SIMILAR CONTACTS WITH OUR PROPOSAL THE TO APPROACH MENTAL HEALTH IN FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT WAYS. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY SEVEN REQUIRED LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO CREATE SUICIDE PREVENTION INTERVENTION AND POST TENSIONED PLANS FOR STUDENTS H. K. THROUGH TWELVE. WHILE THE STEP IS ADMIRABLE WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING FOCUSES ON A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF MENTAL HEALTH FOCUSING MORE ON WELLNESS THAT WOULD PROVIDE YOUNG STUDENTS WITH NECESSARY MINDFULNESS SELF CARE EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND RELEVANT STRESS DIMINISHING PRACTICES THAT ARE INFLUENTIAL TO THEIR LONG TERM GROWTH. WE PROPOSE THAT IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL WELL BEING EDUCATION ALL LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES SHALL COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SCHOOL COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS AND THE LOCAL COULD COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLAN. TO CREATE A MORE SCHOOL EMOTIONAL WELLNESS PLANS FOR EACH ACADEMIC GRADE KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE. EACH GRADE LEVEL WILL LEARN NEW SKILLS THAT BUILD UPON THEIR SKILLS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS. AT THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THIS PLAN WILL TOUCH ON WHAT MENTAL HEALTH IS AND HOW STUDENTS CAN MAINTAIN A HEALTHY MENTAL WELL BEING BY INCORPORATING HEALTHY PRACTICES INTO THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE STYLES. THIS WILL HELP TO PREVENT ANXIETY LOWER GENERAL STRESS LEVELS AND PRACTICE OUT OF REACH FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. RATHER THAN CREATE NEW CURRICULUM TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS WILL INCORPORATE THESE MENTAL WELLNESS TECHNIQUES AND PRACTICES INTO DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES OUR APPROACH TO MENTAL HEALTH IS A POSITIVE ONE LOOKING AT TECHNIQUES LIKE MEDITATION YOGA AND MINE FOR MINUTES THAT CAN GREATLY BENEFIT ONE'S MENTAL HEALTH. IS THIS YOUR VALLEY MIDDLE SCHOOL IMPLEMENTED A MENTAL HEALTH WHAT THIS PLAN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THROUGH MEDITATION PROGRAM THAT GARNERED IMPRESSIVE RESULTS DRASTICALLY REDUCING ITS EXPANSION RATES DURING A TIME OF HIGH CRIME AND VIOLENCE RATES FOR THE AREA. THE SCHOOL ALSO SAW IMPROVED DISAPPEARED WITH DAILY ATTENDANCE RATES AND GRADE POINT AVERAGES AND WAS REPORTED TO EVEN HAVE SOME OF THE HELP YOU STUDENTS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA. IT IS CLEAR FROM BASED ON THAT WELL THIS ACTIVITIES IN SCHOOLS NOT ONLY A STUDENTS WILL BE FOR THE- QUALITY OF SCHOOL CULTURE THERE IS OF COURSE A COST TO THESE ACTIONS IN RELATION TO THE OVERALL PRICE PASTA SO SEATED THE CREATION OF AN EMOTIONAL WELLNESS PLAN WILL COST MONEY TO. USE RELATING TO THE TIME REQUIRED EL IS TO PLAN. HELLO THE LAST STOP OF THIS. MOTION WILL BE IT'S NOT BEEN FULLY DRESSED. THE COST WILL ULTIMATE AND INVESTMENT THROUGH THE EMOTIONAL BEING YOUNG IN FULL BY THE OCEAN A WITNESS BUT- ARE NOT ONLY CONCERN IMMEDIATE AND SAID WE TAKE CONSIDERATION THE LONG TERM THE PREVENTION. CURRENTLY IN PLACE ARE BENEFICIAL HOWEVER WE BELIEVE. CAN BE. HE TOOK THE COAT I CAN GO OVER THEM WITH THE ABILITY TO SOLVE ANY PROBLEMS THEY ARE FACED WITH A YOUNG AGE WHEN THEY'RE NEUROPLASTICITY IS AT ITS HIGHEST IT IS EMOTIONAL WELLNESS PLANS ARE PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO ALSO REALLY GRADUATE WITH THE MENTAL TOOLS GIVEN TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH AND BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. THANK YOU WE ARE NOT I WOULDN'T OPEN TO QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. THANK YOU AND AGAIN VERY. VERY WELL PRESENTED AND VERY ARTICULATE- SO LET ME JUST. BE CLEAR SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU WANT. WHAT YOUR BILL SEEKS TO DO IT SEEKS TO HAVE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS DEVELOP A MENTAL WELLNESS PLAN. THAT WOULD THEN BE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE DISTRICT AND ALL SCHOOLS IN GRADES K. THROUGH TWELVE. HEY AND THAT PLAN COULD MEAN MANY THINGS AGAIN ARE YOU TAKING ON THAT LOCAL CONTROL- MONTEREY APPRECIATE THAT SOMEONE WAS I GOT YOU. AND THEN- KNOWING ME BUT EITHER WAY. TELL TELL ME WHAT THIS MIGHT LOOK LIKE AGAIN ON THE GROUND AND I'M OUT OF SCHOOL THE PLANTS BEEN DEVELOPED IT'S BEEN ADOPTED BY THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD. WHAT MIGHT THIS MEAN. WHAT MIGHT I SEE. SO THIS CAN ENTERED INTRODUCED A COUPLE OF TECHNIQUES- INCLUDING LIKE MINDFUL MINUTES- MEDITATION PRACTICES. ANYTHING TO LIKE. INTRODUCE STUDENTS TO. LIKE WAYS TO COPE WITH. STRESS AND ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. IN ORDER TO- DEVELOP THOSE IDEAS FURTHER IN THEIR EDUCATION. LIKE THE EXAMPLES WE GAVE ACT HI THEY CAN BE SMALL THINGS LIKE A CREDO TEACHER HAD THEM. JUST A SAKE- POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS PRIOR TO A TEST I THINK IT WAS I KNOW MORE THAN I THINK I DO. SO THAT WAY THEY'RE CONFIDENT GOING INTO THE TEST. FOR PERFORM BETTER. BUT IS ALSO SPEAKS THE OVERALL MENTAL HOW THE STUDENTS BY. CHANGING THE DAY UP A BIT. IN DOING I HEARD EXERCISE EARLIER. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHAT WE MIGHT DO YOGA. AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE MICHAEL DOT CUTTING RIGHT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHATEVER FITS OUR- OUR GEOGRAPHY HEARING- OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU I GET IT I GET IT AT A WHICH REALLY SEEKING DISTRICTS TO JUST BE MINDFUL. OF THEIR NEED TO ADDRESS STUDENTS HELP STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. THANK YOU. THAT. SENATOR AND I SHOULD. NOTE THE PRESENCE OF A ASSEMBLY MEMBER OFSHE KALRA RIGHT THERE HE'S FROM THE SAN JOSE AREA'S VERY NICE GUY. THE NICEST GUYS THE STATE ASSEMBLY CARES ABOUT PEOPLE VERY KIND AND LOVES A LOT A LAWS I TELL YOU THAT SENATOR GOING. OKAY VERY GOOD- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF THE WE WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS. DID YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD. EITHER RESOURCES OR IDEAS ABOUT. WHERE WHERE THE IDEAS WOULD COME FROM OF WHAT IT INVOLVES TEACHERS GETTING TRAINED TO DO THIS OBVIOUSLY TEACHERS WOULD YOU KNOW NOT ALL TEACHERS HAVE THE SAME IDEAS OR COULD EVEN COME UP WITH THE- IDEAS SO. HOW DO YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EITHER IN COST. OR THE PROCESS OF COMING UP WITH THE WELLNESS PROGRAM THE ROLE OF TEACHERS AND THE KIND OF TRAINING OR PREPARATION THAT THEY WOULD NEED. TO CARRY OUT A WELLNESS PROGRAM IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE. SO WE DO YOU REALIZE THAT THIS WOULD BE AN INVESTMENT BUT WE THINK WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL INVESTMENT SINCE IT'S PRIORITIZE IS STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH AND THEIR WELL BEING- WE REALIZE THAT IT WOULD A PLAN WE NEED TO BE. GIVEN BY THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES I CREATED BY THEM AND THEN THERE FOR PRESENTED TO THE TEACHERS AND TO GIVE NEXT MISSION TO THE TEACHERS. SO IT WOULD BE IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A PLAN THAT IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO BE ADOPTED DIFFERENT WAYS AND DISTRICTS. BUT ALSO GIVES KIND OF LIKE A STANDARD OF HOW TEACHERS SHOULD APPROACH THEIR STUDENTS WELL BEING MENTAL WELL BEING. YEAH. A LITTLE ADDING ON TO THAT KIND OF GOING BACK TO WHAT NO ANA SAID DISTRICTS WOULD COME UP WITH THOSE PLANS AND GIVE THEM TO THE SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS SUCH AS EXAMPLES OF WHAT THEY COULD DO SUCH AS YOGA ARE MINDFUL MINUTES AND TEACHERS COULD DECIDE WHICH ONES THEY WANTED TO DO AND IMPLEMENT THOSE IN THEIR CLASSROOMS. I APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU'D FIND A GUY LIKE ME CAN OF BREAKING INTO YOGA. IN ANOTHER CLASS WHAT OR WHAT YES YES EXACTLY. I WOULD THAT I MISSED KALRA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DON'T KNOW YOU MIGHT LIKE YOU THINK YOU SEE IT WOULD FIT FOR HIM WELL NO I SAY GO DO IT THE PERSONAL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU I WAS TRYING OTHER COMMITTEE AND I HAVE A MOTHER MEETING COMING UP A LITTLE BUT I DON'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON COMING TO AS MUCH AS I CAN OF THIS MOODY'S PRESENTATIONS. AT ALL. WE HAVE A DIFFERENT PROBLEM I THINK LEGISLATIVE. THINK THEY KNOW MORE THAN THEY ACTUALLY DO IS- WE DON'T. HAVE TO DO THAT MANTRA- HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT- I WOULD SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE PRESENTATION BECAUSE- IN. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT I WENT TO THE SIDE UNION. DASHER IMPLEMENTED A START WITH ONE SCHOOL IN THIS ARTIC SPENDING IT- MINDFULNESS. YOGA ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION SO THERE'S CONFLICTS RATHER THAN JUST A SPENDING ONE STUDENTS SPANISH IT. THEY HAVE TO GET THEM. TO THINK NOTED TO SOME OF THESE PRACTICES AND THEN. TRY TO RESOLVE AFTER DOING SOME OF THESE COMPONENTS PRACTICES WHETHER OR NOT CALMER. STATE OF MIND. AND WHAT THE DISTRICTS BOUND AS THAT THE ACATHE- AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE IS GOT UP. AND ACTUALLY PAY MORE THAN PAID FOR ITSELF. BY JUST. HAVING STUDENTS ATTENDING SCHOOL UP. AND SO IS DEFINITELY. A WIN WIN. THE UP FRONT COST AS YOU NOTED WOULD BE THE ISSUES LIKE MAKING SURE THE DISTRICTS OF THE MINISTER OF COSTS THAT UP PROGRAM. BUT I THINK IN THE LONG RUN. AS STATED IT WOULD DEFINITELY SAVE DISTRICTS MONEY. AND WILL HAVE THE ULTIMATE GOAL WHICH HAVE MORE STUDENTS IN. PREPARED IN CLASS PREPARED AND HAVING THE RIGHT MINDSET TO SUCCEED SO. EVEN THE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU. TING OF COMMON. SENSE HI. YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION VERY WELL DONE YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOURSELF. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT PANEL WILL BE. A MINORITY STUDENT SUPPORT MINORITY STUDENTS SUPPORT THEY COULD COME FOR PLEASE THIS TEAM MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ELLA PASCO AND I'M A SENIOR TENDING SAMMY NEED A HIGH SCHOOL IN THE THIRTY THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND A TOUGH SENATE-DISTRICT MY NAME IS A FOOT TALL AND I AM A JUNIOR ATTENDING MONTA VISTA HIGH SCHOOL IN THE SIXTEENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND THE SEVENTH. SENATE DISTRICT MY NAME IS MICHELLE ALICE AND I AM A JUNIOR ATTENDING NORTHGATE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE FOURTEENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND THE SEVEN SENATE DISTRICT ON BEHALF DISABLED DELEGATION WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY DIRECT THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. TO LIMIT A CULTURAL COMMON REQUIREMENT FOR PRELIMINARY MULTI AND SINGLE SUBJECT TEACHING CREDENTIALS. UPON ENTERING MY AP WORLD HISTORY CLASS I KNEW I HAD TWO THINGS TO LOOK FORWARD TO. ARABLE HAND CRAMPS FROM WEEKLY CHAPTER NOTES. AND MRS PAROO SO A TEACHER PRES BY STUDENTS AND FACULTY ALIKE. HOWEVER WHAT MRS PROOF SO ISN'T OFTEN PRIEST FOR IS TO RESPECT OF DIFFERENT CULTURES. AS A MUSLIM MALE GROWING UP IN SUCH A POLITICAL AND POLITICAL CLIMATE IT BROUGHT ME SALAS SEEING A TEACHER TO TRY TO BREAK THROUGH THE MANY FALSE NOTION SURROUNDING MY FAITH. WHETHER IT BE THROUGH HER PARTICIPATION IN THE WORLD HER JOB DAY OR PROVIDING A SAFE SPACE IN HER CLASSROOM FOR THE SCHOOL'S MUSLIM STUDENT ASSOCIATION EVERY FRIDAY. MRS PROOF SO HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT REGARDLESS OF RACE GENDER RELIGION OR ETHNICITY. TEACHERS CAN SERVE AS A POWERFUL FORCE IN BRIDGING ETHNIC DIVIDES WHEN CULTURALLY COMPETENT. DESPITE BEING A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR ELEVEN YEARS IT WAS NOT UNTIL MY JUNIOR YEAR THAT I WAS FINALLY TAUGHT BY A TEACHER TO ACTIVELY SOUGHT CULTURAL COMPETENCY. DEFINED AS A SET OF BEHAVIORS ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS THAT ALLOW PROFESSIONAL TO BE EFFECTIVE IN A VARIETY OF CROSS CULTURAL ENVIRONMENTS. MY A. P. LITERATURE TEACHER MISS REED IS NOT A PERSON OF COLOR BUT REGULARLY ATTENDS ANTI RACISM SEMINARS AND LECTURES TO IMPLEMENT THESE PRACTICES IN THE CLASSROOM AND TEACHER STUDENTS TO BE CULTURALLY COMPETENT IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. AS A PERSON OF COLOR HAVING A TEACHER OPENLY TALK ABOUT CULTURAL DIFFERENCES WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED EXPERIENCE AND I GREATLY APPRECIATED THE FOSTER I'M NOT ONLY MY PEERS CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE OF MY OWN. HOWEVER EVERY SCHOOL WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE A MYSTERY OR MRS BRUCE SO. THIS CULTURAL COMPETENCY REQUIREMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR ACCREDITING THAT OUT NEWS FOR ALL TYPES THE TEAM IS IN CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR. WHILE OBSERVING CULTURAL COMPETENCY ACROSS VARIOUS REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA WE DISCOVERED A PLETHORA OF CONCERNING CASES. MOST NOTABLY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. A STUDENT FROM MY SCHOOL DISTRICT RAN FOR A SB PRESIDENT UNDER THE PLATFORM AND I QUOTE. ELECT TO ME AND I WILL PROTECT YOU FROM ISIS. INITIALLY THE STUDENT WAS DISQUALIFIED BY THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION AFTER HIS CAMPAIGN VIDEO WAS SHOWN TO THE SCHOOL. HOWEVER FOLLOWING LEGAL ACTION HE ATTEMPTED THE SCHOOL BACKTRACKED AND GRANTED THE STUDENT THE PRESIDENCY. IN LIGHT OF THE SITUATION BELIEVE THAT YOU INFORMED EDUCATOR PERSPECTIVES ON THE EPERIENCES OF MARGINALIZED STUDENTS. ALLOWS FOR THE PROLIFERATION OF HATE SPEECH ACADEMIC INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE IN THE CLASSROOM. HI TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOL BEEN TRAINED IN CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPACT. ON THE SCHOOL'S MUSLIM STUDENTS. SUCH A CAMP WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. AB THREE THREE ONE TWO THREE TWENTY ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM ADOPTED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION WILL PROMOTE COLLECTIVE RACIAL EMPOWERMENT. BANKER JEAN COAT CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DIFFERENT GROUPS HAVE STRUGGLED AND WORKED TOGETHER. THE PROPOSED CULTURAL COMPETENCY TREE TEACHER TRAINING WOULD BE ADDED THREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS OF THE DC. DEVELOPING WHICH. AND INSTRUCTION AND HEALTH EDUCATION. CULTURAL COMPETENCY TRAINING SHOULD BE STANDARD ACROSS ALL MULTI AND SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THE EDUCATORS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO FACILITATE HEALTHY CONVERSATIONS SURROUNDING A VARIETY OF CULTURAL IDENTITIES AS WELL AS PREVENT CONFLICT. THIS CONDITION FOR ACCREDITATION PROGRAMS WILL BE A DOCTORAL BASED ON EACH SCHOOL'S SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC WILL INCLUDE THE BASELINE KNOWLEDGE A PROFICIENT UNDERSTANDING OF OTHER CULTURES AND WILL TEACH EDUCATORS TO INTERACT WITH CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS. AND POINT TECHNIQUES SUCH AS ACTIVE LISTENING ELABORATION PARAPHRASING EVERY STATEMENT. WITH THIS REQUIREMENT IN TEACHER CREDIT ATION EDUCATORS WILL BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD. FEEL MATURE THE RELATIONAL AND INTERPERSONAL SKILLS AND THAT'S BE ABLE TO RIDE INCLUDES ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL STE. AS A RESULT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW. DID IN SAFE AT SCHOOL WE CAN EXPECT STUDENTS TO DRIVE IN THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY KNOW THEY DO NOT FEEL UNDERSTOOD. THISOPPOSE A WOULD EVENTUALLY DECREASE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM HATE SPEECH IN BOWLING AS WELL AS WORK TO ELIMINATE THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE AMONG ETHNICALLY DIFFERENT STUDENTS A PRIMARY GOAL OF GOVERNOR NEW SET AND SUPER. THURMAN ULTIMATELY STUDENTS TO FEEL MORE MOTIVATED TO ATTEND SCHOOL AND CONTINUE LEARNING RESULTING IN ADVANCE MAN HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. WE ARE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY TO SPEAK FOR THE STUDENTS TRAPPED IN A CYCLE OF OPPRESSION. WITH THE NEW DIVERSE GENERATION OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INCREASE IN ATTENTION ON CULTURAL COMPETENCY. AS IT IS EVERY STUDENTS RIGHT TO LEARN IN A SAFE AND COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT. ONCE AGAIN WE ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO DIRECT THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING TO ADD AN INSTRUCTION FOR CULTURAL COMES REQUIRED. FOR CAN APPROVE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS NECESSARY THREE C. PRELIMINARY MULTIPLE SUBJECT AND SINGLE SUBJECT TEACHING CREDENTIALS. WE HOPE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN PAVE THE WAY TO AND EDUCATE. THEM NO STUDENT FEELS LIMITED IN THEIR FUTURE POTENTIAL. RESULT OF A DISK FOR THE- DEBATE IS THANK YOU. YEAH OKAY. THERE WE GO UP I THINK I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS YOU WANT TEACHERS TO HAVE THE SKILLS TO FACILITATE DISCUSSION UNDERSTANDING AMONG STUDENTS BUT ALSO AMONGST FACULTY FOR SURE AND ALL ALL SCHOOL SITE PERSONAL- IS THAT KIND OF IN A NOT SHOW WHERE YOU THINK THEY SHOULD GO WELL ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE ARE. FOCUSED ON PRIMARILY IS ACCREDITING NUDE. SO WE'RE HOPING THAT IN THE FUTURE THIS IS JUST ONE. OF A LARGE ISSUE SO THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE APPROACHED IT SO IN THE FUTURE WE ARE HOPING TO EXTEND TO NOT ONLY ADMINISTRATION AND FACULTY. BUT ALSO SUBSTITUTE SOME LONG TERM SUBSTITUTES AS WELL. OKAY AND THEN I. DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY TAKING KIND OF STAFF OF THIS I THINK WHAT YOU'RE- SEEKING TO DO IS REBOOT THIS- ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO GIVE OR TAKE TWENTY FIVE. SOMEWHERE IN THERE CALIFORNIA DEVELOP THE CLASS THE- BIG WE CALL THE CLAD CREDENTIAL IS THE CROSS CULTURAL LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT. CREDENTIAL RIGHT I HAVE ONE WARY AND IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT. YOU KNOW GEE HOW DO YOU TEACH. AND HOW DO YOU DEAL STUDENT BEHAVIOR EXETER WAS ALSO ABOUT- FERMENTING SOME CROSS CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING BUILT INTO THE CREDENTIAL ALSO OF SOME LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT. BECAUSE SAYS CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION CHANGE SO HAS OUR OUR OUR LANGUAGES. AND OUR NEED TO ADDRESS. STUDENTS ABILITY TO IT TOOK TO ACQUIRE LANGUAGE A CLASSROOM SETTING SAYS TEACHERS NEED THE NEED THE SKILLS SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS CALIFORNIA NAME MAYBE NEEDS TO. TO REBOOT THAT SOME THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IS IT'S ALREADY DIFFICULT TO BECOME A TEACHER. MARTIN AND EXPENSIVE. TO GET THAT CREDENTIAL YOU GO FOR YEARS AND THEN YOU GO ANOTHER YEAR. MORE CREDENTIALED IS PRETTY EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN PRETTY CUMBERSOME TAKES A LOT OF TIME ON A CLASSES THEN YOU DO THE- YOU KNOW YOU DO THE STUDENT TEACHING AND- TO HOLD A JOB REALLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT SO IT'S PRETTY TOUGH ENTRY TO GET. TO BECOME A TEACHER. SO JUST THINK GEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE COULD REMOVE TO. SECOND ASK YOU TO POINT OUT ANYTHING TODAY. BUT IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN REMOVE. FROM THE- FROM THE CREDENTIALING EXPERIENCE THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT TO. TO MAKE YOUR YOUR PROPOSITION. A MORE VIABLE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE BIT LEERY OF YOUR SOMETIMES OF JUST ADDING MORE THINGS ON. WE'RE NOT TAKING THINGS OFF THAT MAYBE AREN'T SO RELEVANT TODAY. THAT'S JUST SOMETHING ON. I ENCOURAGE YOU. TO THINK ABOUT- AND WHAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA TEACHING CREDENTIALING. AND WHAT LEGISLATURE THROUGH A BILL LIKE THIS WILL PROBABLY DO. YOU COULD DO A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS WE WERE DIRECT THEM. MAYBE TO DEVELOP. AN ADVANCED CREDENTIAL LORD ENHANCE CREDENTIAL OR REBUILT. THE EXISTING CREDENTIAL TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU NEED. WE WOULD HAND IT OFF TO THEM I DON'T THINK MAYBE I SHOULD LOOK OVERSTAFFED I DON'T THINK WE TRYING TO THAT NECESSARILY HERE WITHIN THIS BODY AS MUCH AS WE GIVE THEM THE TASK. BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE MORE HAVE MORE EXPERTISE IN THE HUNDRED TWENTY MEMBERS HERE. ON ON ON CREDENTIALING IN THE CLASS IS NEEDED AND- YOU DON'T ALWAYS WANT THE LEGISLATURE DESIGNED THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW. WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE TRUST ME US WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD JOB AND- I DON'T OUR CARS RESIDENT. AT THAT THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION OF THINK THAT. EVERY EVERY POINT YOU MAY IS RIGHT ON POINT AND I THINK THE CHAIR HAD A- OF. A GOOD SUGGESTION IN THAT THERE ARE IF THERE'S ALREADY SOMETHING IN PLACE OFTENTIMES SPECIALLY WAS BEEN AROUND FOR TWENTY YEARS. THERE'S ALWAYS OPPORTUNITIES REVISE IT TO REFRESH IT. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN- AND THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT STUDENTS ARE GOING THROUGH NOW THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING THROUGH TWENTY YEARS AGO AND- BUT TEACHERS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT. AND SO I THINK THERE MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY- REALLY TO WORK WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF INSTRUCTION FROM EDUCATION. TO A WORK ON UPDATING AND REFRESHING- AND ALL OF THESE ARE EXISTING EXISTENT IN THE CODE. AND THE CREDENTIALING PROCESS- I SUPPOSE INTRODUCING SOMETHING NEW WHEN YOU KNOW AND SOMETIMES AS- MANY THAT COULD BE. A MORE BUT ALSO PRODUCE EVEN BETTER RESULTS THAN AS THE- AS THE CHAIRS AND A- HUNDRED TWENTY LEGISLATURE FIGURE OUT. WHAT THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IS THAT IT DOES WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO GROUND LEVEL. OF INVENTING IT. IS AT LEAST A DOZEN ACTUALLY SERVE THE GOLD YOU'RE TRYING TO. REACH AND SO BUT I OTHERWISE. THE GOAL WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS VERY LAUDABLE AND I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION ON IT. AND THE CAMEL. IS A HORSE DESIGNED BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE. GET THAT SENATOR. WELL I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I COULD SEE FROM THE DELEGATES IS A RICHER FOR DELEGATES THE DELEGATES THAT YOU HAVE A VERY DIVERSE. REPRESENTATION I THINK OF US STUDENT BODIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- SOMETHING THAT'S NOT. DIRECTLY DIRECTLY RELATED TO YOUR PROPOSAL BUT WE ARE- WE ARE IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE STRUGGLING WITH THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN BUILT IN BIASES- EITHER ON THE BASIS OF FAITH OR ON THE BIG BASES OF ETHNICITY OR WHERE YOU WERE BORN. AND THIS NATION HAS BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THAT SINCE ITS INCEPTION- AND WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING T FIGURE OUT HOW WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE REMIND OURSELVES THAT WE ARE A NATION OF DIVERSITY NOT OF ONE RACE OR NOT OF ONE FAITH- WE'VE HAD BIG DEBATES APPEAR. OVER ETHNIC STUDIES AS A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE LEARNS ABOUT HISTORY TO HISTORY AND- WHAT IT HAS TAKEN FOR PEOPLE'S FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO COME HERE. AND. AND ADOPT THIS NATION CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD- SO IT'S ALWAYS IT'S BEEN AN ISSUE HERE I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE YEAR BUT I'VE ALREADY SEEN- THE DEBATES AROUND IT- THIS IS ANOTHER WAY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. BY MAKING SURE THAT TEACHERS ARE- CONTINUOUSLY. THE SAY UPGRADED OR UPDATED- AND REMINDED- BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE STUDENTS YOUR AGE YOUNGER. IF YOU WANT TO BE A- GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL SHOULD THOSE BE REQUIREMENTS SO. I URGE YOU TO STAY CONNECTED TO THAT BROADER DEBATE AS WELL AS A VERY SPECIFIC PROPOSAL THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE MAKING YOUR RIGHT NOW AND I. SALUTE YOU AND THANK YOU. HI TO ADDRESS. MR O'DONNELL'S POINT AND TO KIND OF GO BACK TO WHAT MISTER KALRA IF I'M PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY- WAS TALKING ABOUT- WE ACTUALLY INVESTIGATED THE CD EITHER CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S WEBSITE. AND WE LOOK THROUGH I GUESS IT WAS A SORT OF TOOL KIT TO ASSIST TEACHERS WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO BE LIKE CULTURALLY COMPETENT TO ESSENTIALLY TEACH CULTURAL COMPETENCY. AND WE ACTUALLY FOUND A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MISTER KALRA- WHERE A LOT OF THE MATERIALS WERE EITHER LIKE MISS REPRESENTATIVE OF LIKE THE STUDENTS WERE BEING PORTRAYED IN THE VIDEOS OR WERE JUST. BLATANTLY NOT RIGHT TO FIGHT FOR TEACHERS TO BE LIKE LOOKING AT IT THROUGH THAT APPROACH AND I THINK THAT YOU GUYS REYES A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT AND I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED WITH LIKE THE LEGISLATURE AND TRYING TO LIKE I GUESS MANDATE SOMETHING. LIKE WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TODAY BUT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IS LESS OF KIND OF TRYING TO TEACH CULTURAL COMPETENCY BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY LIKE IF WE WERE TO TRY AND IMPOSE. LIKE SOME KIND OF TEACHING THING IT WOULD KIND OF JUST FALLEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I THINK THE RIVER ALREADY SEEN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS KIND OF DROPPED THE BALL A LOT OF THE TIMES WITH- CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE DECIDE TO MANDATE. AND I THINK THAT IF WE WERE TO KIND OF ADDRESS THIS HEAD ON WHEN TEACHERS ARE GETTING THEIR CULTURAL- LIKE ARE THERE SCHOOL TEACHING ACCREDITATION- TO KIND OF INTRODUCE THIS CULTURAL FACETS TO IT I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S- REALLY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. VERY WELL PRESENTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE JOB. NEXT WILL HERE FROM POSITIVE DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES. IT I SHOULD IS NATASHA SOSA HER. HOLLY RIGHT ALL RIGHT IN THE EARLY FOR FROM FROM A FROM A TOWN RIGHT THERE ARE YOU KNOW YOU HELP WITH THE LAST PANEL SO GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB OR THANK YOU NATASHA. ALL RIGHT OUT YOU MAY INTRODUCE YOURSELVES AND PROCEED WHEN READY. HEY OF. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR SOME WOMEN O'DONNELL- THE SENATE ASSEMBLY COULD YOU EDUCATION COMMITTEES AND HONORED GUESTS I HOPE YOU ARE DOING WELL TODAY- MY NAME IS NOT A GONZALEZ I'M FROM SAN BENITO HIGH SCHOOL ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THIRTY AND SENATE DISTRICT TWELVE MY NAME IS JEFFREY- IN AT TEN SOUTH PASADENA HIGH SCHOOL ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FORTY ONE IN SENATE DISTRICT TWENTY FIVE. AND I MAKAYLA COKE FROM ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS SIXTY AND SENATE DISTRICT THIRTY ONE. WE PROPOSE A MANDATE FOR THE INFORMING OF STUDENTS RIGHTS REGARDING DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SENATE ANY UNIFIED HAD NEARLY NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DAYS OF SUSPENSION WHICH COST THE DISTRICT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS DO STATE FUNDING BEING LARGELY BASED UPON ATTENDANCE. FROM THIS IT IS UNDERSTOOD BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT SUSPENSIONS ARE NO WAY HELPING SCHOOLS. AS SAID IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN BY FORMER US SECRETARY OF EDUCATION DUNCAN. THE NEED TO RETHINK AND REDESIGN SCHOOL DISCIPLINE PRACTICES IS LONG OVERDUE. TOO MANY SCHOOLS RESORT TO QUICKLY TO EXCLUSIONARY DISCIPLINE EVEN FOR MINOR MISS BEHAVIORS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZE THIS ONE LC UP OF CREATED PARTY SEVEN IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. IT'S STRONGLY RECOMMENDS TO SCHOOLS TO INVOLVE STUDENTS IN DISCIPLINARY POLICIES. AND PRACTICES TO BUILD A SENSE OF OWNERSHIP THROUGH POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORTS RESTORATIVE PRACTICES AND YOUTH COURT. UNDER THE LC FF RECOMMENDATION FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN THE NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS LOST A SUSPENSIONS DROPPED FORTY SIX POINT 1% THUS THE STATE HAS RECOGNIZED IMPROVING THAT POSITIVE DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES ARE EFFECTIVE AND NECESSARY TO REFORMING DISCIPLINE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION HAS PREVIOUSLY REFERENCED SANTA ANA SANTA ANA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT RECEIVED A GRANT FROM THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS SINCE INVEST IN WITHIN THREE MILLION DOLLARS INTO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AS WELL AS RELATED PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT THE DISTRICTS SAUCES PENSION RESTRUCTURE 75% IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. SUSPENSION RATES HOWEVER ARE ONLY QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF THE PUNISHMENT AND THEREFORE STILL PART OF THE PUNITIVE SYSTEM IT DOES NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT THE SCHOOL CULTURE IN ITS ENTIRETY. SUSPENSION RATES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED BUT AS A WHOLE WE FEEL THAT THE KEY ISSUE IS NOT TANGIBLE STATISTICS OR RATHER LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF SCHOOL DISPLACES THEM WITH THOSE WHO ACTUALLY BEING DISCIPLINED THE STUDENTS. WE OTHER STUDENT ADVISORY BOARD ON LEGISLATION ROOT PROBLEM THAT NEGATIVE IN PUNITIVE DISCIPLINE HAS BECOME SO NORMALIZED INGRAINED INTO SOCIETY THAT THEY CREATE A SCHOOL CULTURE WHERE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SYSTEM OUR KNOWLEDGE. YET CONTINUE TO BE PERPETUATED. WE AS A TEAM PROPOSED THAT PRIOR TO ANY DISCIPLINARY ACTION TAKEN A LIST OF STUDENTS RIGHTS MUST BE READ TO STUDENTS IN GRADES SIX THROUGH TWELVE. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE INFORMED OF THE DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES OF THAT SPECIFIC SCHOOL. THIS LIST MUST BE CULTURALLY RELEVANT AND AGE APPROPRIATE. BE READ BY A THIRD PARTY SUCH AS A COUNSELOR IN A PRIVATE SETTING. INCLUDE THAT MINERS CAN HAVE A PARENT GUARDIAN PRESENT. DURING THESE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AND THAT THE STUDENT HAS A RIGHT TO A TRANSLATOR IF UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS. AND COULD CITIZENS FOR RIGHTS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR PROPOSAL. TO FURTHER STUDENT UNDERSTANDING. THESE POLICIES WILL BE PUBLICIZED ON THE SCHOOL WEBSITE AND INFORM OF POSTERS DISPLAYED AROUND THE SCHOOL ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WERE DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS USUALLY TAKEN. SUCH AS COUNSELOR PSYCHOLOGIST AND ADMINISTRATORS OFFICES OURTEAM DETAILED HOW GAS IN THIS UNDERSTANDING OUR MAJOR THEME IN THAN JUSTICES WITHIN OUR THEIR OWN DESPAIR ASSISTANCE. IN MANY SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA OUR DELEGATES EXPERIENCE ON WELCOME SITUATIONS IN THE DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM. THAT WHEN THE STUDENTS SIGNED AWAY THEIR RIGHTS AS A TORTILLA EXPECTED THEM TO SIGN PAPERS BEFORE KNOWING THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE PROCESS FOR THEMSELVES. AS WELL AS THE GUARDIANS. PERSONALLY I'VE SEEN PEERS WHO RECENTLY MOVED TO THE UNITED STATES FACE ADMINISTRATION AND SIGNED INCOMPREHENSIBLE DOCUMENTS. IT'S ALREADY SCARY ENOUGH TO BE UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE PROPERLY DALY. AND IT WORSENS WRESTLED DISCIPLINARY SITUATIONS AS AN IMMIGRANTS I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST THAT LEARNING IN AMERICAN SCHOOL SYSTEM WAS ON CRUISING OUT FIRST IN MANY WAYS. WHILE THEY'RE WORKING TO GET OUT OF YOUR DE AND DEVELOPING DEVELOPING MY ENGLISH. LEARNING DISAPPOINTED TERMS WAS THE LEAST OF MY WORRIES. AND AT RISK STUDENTS SUCH A SECOND LANGUAGE AND DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS ARE BEYOND STRESS TO BE IN A NEW ENVIRONMENT DETRIMENTAL EXPERIENCES WITH THE DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM CAUSE THEM TO LOSE THE DRIVE WITH EDUCATION THERE HOPING TO PURSUE. IS STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO A TRANSLATOR THESE AT RISK TEACH STUDENTS WOULD NOT BE INTIMIDATED AND SCARED BUT WHEN SAID FUEL WELCOME TO SCHOOL CULTURE AS THEY HAVE A CHIU UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE POLICIES AND PROCEEDINGS ARE IN THEIR NEW SETTING. IN SAID IN THIS CURRENT SYSTEM I'VE SEEN CLOSE FRIENDS GIVE UP HOPE IN THEIR SCHOOL SOME EVEN LOOKING TO GO BACK HOME AND THE GRADUATE RATHER THAN. CONTINUING THEIR EDUCATION. IN CONTRAST AT MY SCHOOL SAID IN A HIGH SCHOOL WE HAVE RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED THAT POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORTS PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS P. I. S. WHICH WE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AS A POSITIVE DISCIPLINARY PRACTICE AS A PART OF THE LC UP OF. IN THIS PROGRAM IT. IS WHO ARE INTERESTED WITH IMPLEMENTING P. I. S. ACTIVELY INVOLVE OUR STUDENT BODY WEEKLY THROUGH STUDENT MADE VIDEOS. THAT ARE VIEWED IN HOME ROOMS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS SEE THEM. WITH STUDENT EXPOSED TO PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS THEM TO BE ACTIVE IN THEIR OWN DISCIPLINARY PROCESS THEY FEEL CARED ABOUT AND SUPPORTED BY ADMINISTRATION. AS OPPOSED TO SUBDUED AND HOPELESS. ALTHOUGH THE PBS PROGRAM IS NEW AT MY SCHOOL THIS ALTERNATIVE HAS BEEN A GREAT IMPROVEMENT INVESTMENT IN OUR SCHOOL CULTURE AND CLIMATE. THESE POSITIVE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS SHOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AND ALLOW THEM TO LEARN AND BE REHABILITATED. THIS BILL LIKELY BRINGS TO MIND MARANDA RIGHTS WHICH WERE A SOURCE OF REFERENCE WHEN BRAINSTORMING WHAT MIGHT BE MISSING FROM DISCIPLINARY SYSTEMS AS THEY APPLY TO EDUCATION. WE KNOWLEDGE THAT MIRANDA RIGHTS CAN NO CRIME AND GETTING ARRESTED HOWEVERTHE MARANDA RIGHT CREATED TO ENSURE PEOPLE WERE FULLY AWARE OF THE SITUATION THEY WERE GETTING INTO. SIMILARLY READING THE STUDENTS THEIR RIGHTS WOULD REMIND AND FILL THEM IN ON HOW THEY AND THEIR DISCIPLINARIAN SCAMPER SEAT. WHICH IS PARTICULARLY NECESSARY WHEN STUDENTS OR PEOPLE IN GENERAL ARE PLACE SINCE IS STRESSFUL SITUATIONS. BY UNDERSTANDING THEIR RIGHTS JEWS ARE SHOWN THEIR ROLE AND VALUE AND WHAT OPTIONS THEY HAVE AND ARE EMPOWERED TO DETERMINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS. AND FOR THEIR THEIR PROVE MEANT A SCHOOL IS A PLACE OF SAFETY A STEVE OF LEARNING AND GROWING. BY UNDERSTANDING THEIR DISCIPLINARY RIGHTS STUDENTS LEARN HOW THEIR WORLD WORKS AND ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN IT. STUDENTS WILL KNOW THEY HAVE SUPPORT AND THEIR EDUCATION AS IT SHOWS THEY ARE VALUED. AND WILL CHANGE THE CULTURE AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL AS SHOWN BY THE STATE'S ENDORSEMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF POSITIVE DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES. IN SUMMARY THE INVOLVEMENT OF STUDENTS AND FACULTY CREATES A SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR BOTH PARTIES. THE GREATEST IMPACTS THIS BILL WOULD HAVE IS THE CHANGE IN THE CULTURE AND SCHOOL CLIMATE SENATOR STANDING LEADS TO EMPOWERMENT SUPPORT AND SECURITY IN THEIR EDUCATION THAT WILL MORE ACCURATELY CHANGE THE STATISTICS TO REFLECT CHANGING CLIMATE. IN QUANTIFIABLE NUMBERS IT WILL BE SEEN AS ATTENDANCE RATES INCREASING SUSPENSION RATES FURTHER GOING DOWN AND NEGATIVE FUNDING IMPACTS TO DISTRICTS BEING MINIMIZED. FOR SCHOOL CLIMATE IT IS INCREASED MOTIVATION AND ENGAGEMENT OF STUDENTS IN CLASSROOMS SO ALL ASPECTS OF EDUCATION IS AND RICH AND ALL PERSONS FROM TEACHERS TO STAFF TO ADMIN. BENEFIT. THESE CALLS REFORMS CAN IMPACT STUDENTS BE ON THEIR EDUCATION THREE GROWTH OF DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND BE INVOLVED IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION NOW OPEN THE FLOOR TO ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS AND CONCERNS GREAT THANK YOU- SO LET ME BE CLEAR ON WHAT THE POLICY PROPOSAL AS- YOU WISH TO HAVE A STUDENTS. RIGHTS READ TO THEM BY A THIRD PARTY. YES IT MEANING THAT THIRD PARTY WOULD BE ON NOT NOT SOMEONE FOR OFF THE SCHOOL SITE FOR MOVE FROM SOMEONE FROM ON SCHOOL. SO SPECIFICALLY WE LISTED A THIRD PARTY SO THAT A STUDENT IS TAKEN AWAY FROM THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS FOR A BRIEF TIME. OF LIKELY MOST PREFERRED THE THIRD PARTY WOULD BE A COUNSELOR SO THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY. FULLY INVOLVED IN THE DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM TYPICALLY DISCIPLINE IS TAKING IS DONE BY- ASSISTANT PRINCIPALS OR VICE PRINCIPALS DEPENDENT ON THE TERM- BUT BY USING A COUNSELOR. IT'S A STAFF THAT IS KNOWN TO BE A SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS. AND SIMPLY AS A SUPPORT. IT AND THEN THE ROLE OF THE COUNCIL WOULD BE TOO OLD TO DO WHAT EXACTLY THEM SO THE COUNSELOR WOULD TAKE THE STUDENT INTO A PRIVATE SETTING SO THAT IT'S A SORT OF DE ESCALATION OF ANY SITUATION THAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING. AND IN A THE. THERE WOULD BE THE LIST POSTED SINCE AS THEIR AS THEY WOULD BE POSTED AROUND THE SCHOOL OR ON THE SCHOOL WEBSITE THEY COULD SIMPLY. READ OFF OF THAT SO THAT THE STUDENTS WOULD NOW. OKAY I CAN TAKE A MOMENT TO BREATHE. PROCESS A SITUATION. ME CONTACT THE PARENT IF I WANT TO OR I CAN DO THIS OR OPTION A B. OR C. I UNDERSTAND BUT I THINK YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS HERE IS THAT. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE COUNSELOR READING THIS OFF TO THEM THAT'S GOING TO BE SO IMPACTFUL AS THEIR INTERACTION WITH. A COUNSELOR IN THE SITUATION WOULD BE IMPACT FOR YOU TRYING TO DRAW CANCERS IN TO THE DISCIPLINE PROCESS. YEAH WE'RE OUR MAIN FOCUS IS. SO THAT STUDENTS UNDERSTAND THAT IS CONSISTENT BECAUSE IT'S VERY COMMON STUDENTS VERY CALMLY TALK ABOUT THE DISCIPLINE SYSTEM AND WHAT IS HAPPENING. AND THE PUNISHMENTS AND THERE'S OFTEN TALK ABOUT. HOW THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING OR THEY DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR. BUT THE TH BUT- BY YOU STUDENTS BEING BRED THEIR DISCIPLINARY RIGHTS. THEY WILL UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM AND IT WILL IT WILL ALL OF IT WILL JUST PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE STAFF BUT IT ALSO PROVIDE. THIS FRAMEWORK FOR THE STUDENTS THE ALL PARTIES. ARE ON EVEN LEVEL AND THEY AND EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS HAPPENING OKAY THANK YOU THE GUY I THINK. I THINK THE BIGGER. THE PRO THE MOST POSITIVE THING THAT COME OUT OF A MANDATE LIKE THIS IS THAT THERE BE INTERACTION WITH ACCOUNTS AND I WOULD ALSO SAY. JUST COUPLE THINGS ARE ONE CALORIES IN A MUCH. BETTER JOB THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST YOU KNOW SCHOOL DISCIPLINE. AND I WOULD NEVER SAY THERE SHOULDN'T BE DISCIPLINE SOME PEOPLE TO WHERE WE SHOULD ELIMINATE SCHOOL SUSPENSION NO WAY. WE NEED TO SCHOOL SUSPENSION AS A TOOL AND OFTEN FOR THE SUSPEND THE- RIGHT TO GET THEM OFF CAMPUS FOR A FEW DAYS TO LET SOMETIMES THINGS NEED TO COOL DOWN ON CAMPUS YOU SEEN THE SITUATION OR SOMEBODY'S GET AWAY FOR A COUPLE OF. THINGS COOL DOWN WE BRING THEM BACK NOT ALWAYS AND CERTAINLY IN A VERY IN A VERY YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT THAT ALWAYS HAPPENING JUST SOMETIMES THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE THING TO DO. I WOULD ARGUE- SOME I APPRECIATE YOUR ADDING SOMETHING AND NOT JUST TAKING SOMETHING AWAY TO KEEP SCHOOL SEVEN REALLY I THINK THE BIGGER POINT HERE- AIDS DESTROYING THAT COUNSELOR AND I WAS HE'S GOOD YOU KNOW GOOD. WELL I WOULD SAY CAMPUS IS THE GET THE NEED. TO HAVE A POSITIVE DISCIPLINE PROCESS ALREADYARE DOING THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ALL OUR- BUT THEY SHOULD BE DOING THAT WITH MANY OF THE LAWS IN THE MONIES THAT WE PASSED DOWN. TO THE LOCAL LEVELS ME BUILT SUSPENSION AND THE EL CAP AND SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE. SO I AM FOR A PRE SHEET YOUR APPROACH VERY MUCH THANK YOU. CENTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SEMI MEMBER SO I WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE MAYBE WHAT YOU'RE FEELING AND STUDENTS ARE FEELING IS THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS ALMOST LIKE WHEN A PARENT SAYS DO IT BECAUSE I SAID SO BECAUSE I'M YOUR PARENT- RATHER THAN EXPLAINING WHY YOU'RE IN TROUBLE I WAS ALWAYS VERY HAPPY TO EXPLAIN TO MY CHILDREN WHY THEY WERE IN TROUBLE. BECAUSE I ALWAYS HOPE THAT IT WOULD HELP KEEP THEM FROM DOING IT AGAIN. IT'S AN OF THE DID SOMETIMES IT DIDN'T SO I A REALLY AYE I THINK I CAN EMPATHIZE WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S IF PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND A DISCIPLINARY PROBLEM IN THIS IT- THAT PROCESS IN THIS CASE STUDENTS. YOU JUST YOU'RE JUST LEFT FEELING LIKE YOU'RE BEING PICKED ON OR WHAT DID I DO WRONG SO I DON'T DO IT AGAIN- SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING PROPOSAL I APPRECIATE THE TIMEAND EFFORT YOU PUT INTO IT AND I'M GONNA. GOT HER LITTLE LATE SORRY ALL READ OVER A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT- THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU A TERM OR KALRA. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MEASURE THANK YOU OF FOR THE PRESENTATION AND- I REALLY APPRECIATE THEM THE VERY FLORA GRANDER RIGHTS BECAUSE I WAS A LAWYER IS THE PUBLIC DEFENDER AND WE USED TO. I DON'T THINK ANYONE. WHAT MATTER WHERE THEY GO- WHETHER IT'S- AND INCARCERATE ENVIRONMENT WHETHER IT'S THE LEGISLATURE WHETHER IT'S GOING TO A SCHOOL YOU DON'T RIGHTS AT THE DOOR THEY'RE STILL RIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE THAT THAT ARE VALUABLE AND I THINK KNOWING THE RIGHTS AND MAKING CLEAR THAT INDIVIDUALS KNOW THE RIGHTS IS A VALUABLE- PART OF BEING IN A IN A DEMOCRACY BEING IN A FREE SOCIETY I DO THINK THAT- THE- CHERUB FURTHER- BUT WOULD YOU OUT OF VALUABLE ASPECT OF THIS WHICH IS THE DE ESCALATION. BRING A THIRD PARTY HAVE NOTS THAT'S A I THINK ULTIMATELY MAY PROVE TO BE EVEN MORE VALUABLE ASPECT OF THESE RIGHTS BEING DETAILED AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO MENTION WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATED THE PRIVACY ASPECT- THE PUBLIC SHAMING OF A STUDENT AND THE BUT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH CAN FURTHER ALIENATE THEM. AND THE PRIVACY ASPECT ACTUALLY EMPOWERS THEM IN IT AND ALSO YOU MAY END UP WITH THE RESULT WHERE A STUDENT WILL ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT THEY'VE DONE MUCH MORE QUICKLY BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE GIVING THE RESPECT OF THAT PRIVACY AND SO I REALLY LIKE THE TOP ONE IS THAT YOU PUT INTO THIS APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU THANK YOU. CENTER DRAWS A SEARCHER- I ALSO WANNA THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE KNOW OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE SUSPENSIONS- LED DIRECTLY TO A GREATER NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE ENTERING THE. IS LIKE THE PIPELINE TO PRISON- AND ANYTHING THAT WOULD STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. SO REDUCTIONS I'M I'M I DIDN'T QUITE GET THAT YOU WERE MAKING THE POINT OF PREVENTION. UP MORE MORE DIRECTLY I THINK TO MAKE THAT A VERY EXPLICIT. OLD THAT THIS WOULD SERVE AS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE VERSES LIKE IN MARANDA IT'S AFTER THE FACT- AND- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE IT'S A COMMON THING THAT THAT PEOPLE KNOW OF BUT I THINK THIS SERVES A GREATER PURPOSE WHICH IS NOT AFTER THE FACT OF IT SO YOU KNOW YOUR RIGHTS AND YOU CAN DEFEND YOURSELF BETTER BUT HOW CAN THAT SERVE TO BE A MUCH MORE PREVENTATIVE MEASURE SO I THINK IF YOU'RE MORE EXPLICIT ABOUT THAT. YOU'LL CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE. I THINK YOU GET MORE ATTENTION. ON YOU KNOW TO THE ISSUE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK. GREAT THANK YOU VERY WELL PRESENTED VERY WELL DONE GOOD JOB GOOD JOB THANK YOU AND MISSPOKE. VERY GOOD JOB TODAY YOUR FATHER SENT ME A TAX AND TOLD ME TO BE EASY ON YOU AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DID NEED TO BE EASY ON YOU BECAUSE YOU DO A GREAT JOB ON YOUR OWN HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEVEN THAT TAXED OKAY. I KNOW OUR FATHER FROM LONG BEACH GOOD GUY GOOD FAMILY YOU DID GREAT. YOUR WHOLE TEAM THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. YEAH. AND PUT YOU ON THE SPOT THERE. YOU PAY BACK YOUR FATHER FOR THAT. OKAY OUR NEXT PANELS ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH COME FORWARD PLEASE WE HAVE THIS PANEL AND THEN WE HAVE AN ABBREVIATED PANEL AND THEN WE ARE. MOVING INTO COMPLETION. YEAH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH GRAB A SEAT THERE. AND YOU MAY BE INTRODUCED YOURSELVES AND PROCEED WHEN READY HOWEVER YOU WANT TO ALL RIGHT GOOD EVEN- GOOD AFTERNOON TO SEE MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION IN CHAIRS O'DONNELL AND LEYVA MY NAME IS MERRY ON IN A PRESS AND I RESIDE IN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SEVEN IN SENATE DISTRICTS SIX GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JUST YOU AND I WERE SIDE AND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SEVENTEEN AND SENATE DISTRICT ELEVEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JULIA CRISTIANO AND I RESIDE IN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FORTY FOUR AND SENATE DISTRICT TWENTY SEVEN WE ARE HERE TODAY TO ADDRESS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN SCHOOLS AB TEN PASSED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ADDED SECTION THREE FIVE TWO NINE TWO SIX TO THE EDUCATION CODE MANNED DATING FREE MASTER PRODUCTS TO BE PROVIDED AND 50% OF THE SCHOOLS IN- OF RESTAURANTS IN SCHOOLS IN WHICH THE STUDENT POPULATION IS COMPRISED. OF 40% OR MORE STUDENTS BELOW THE POVERTY THRESHOLD ON BEHALF OF THIS STUDENT BUYS REPORT ON LEGISLATION IN EDUCATION WE STRONGLY URGE THE AMENDMENT OF THE SECTION OF THE EDUCATION CODE. OUR AMENDMENT STIPULATES THAT ALL CALIFORNIA SCHOOL SERVING SIX THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE STUDENTS PROVIDE MENSTRUAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS AN ALL FEMALE DESIGNATED RESTROOMS FACULTY RESTROOMS GENDER NEUTRAL RESTAURANTS AND AT LEAST ONE MALE DESIGNATE A RESTROOM. IMAGINE USING THE RESTROOM AND LOOKING TO BUY ONLY TO FIND THAT THERE'S NO TOILET PAPER. PANIC SETS IN BUT NOT FOR LONG AS IT'S ALMOST A GUARANTEE THAT YOU'LL FIND SOME TOILET PAPER IN THE NEXT ALL. THIS IS NOT THE SAME FOR STUDENTS WHO MENSTRIE AT SCHOOL UNEXPECTEDLY. IF YOUR STUDENT AT MISTY CAME A CLASSY HIGH SCHOOL OR JOHN MARSHALL SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL YOU MUST CHECK SEVERAL MINUTES CROSS CAMPUS. TO THE STUDENT SUPPORT CENTER OR P. E. OFFICE HOPING THERE WILL BE SOMEONE THERE TO HELP MEET YOUR NEEDS. NOW IT IS A MATTER OF HOW MUCH DETRIMENT THE STUDENT CAN ACCUMULATE BEFORE EVENTUALLY GIVING UP AND GOING HOME. IN THE U. S. THIS ISSUE A PERIOD POVERTY KEEPS ONE OUT OF FIVE GIRLS OUT OF SCHOOL DURING THEIR MONTHLY CYCLE THIS STATISTIC DOES NOT EVEN INCLUDE. ALL STUDENTS WHO DO NOT IDENTIFY AS FEMALES IN WHICH CASE THE STATISTIC WOULD BE HIGHER. HAVING SEEN COUNTLESS TIMES THE CONSEQUENCES OF STUDENTS NOT HAVING THE PRODUCTS WE NEED NEED WHEN THEY NEED THEM AT SCHOOL WE FIND THIS ISSUE BECOMES BECAUSE FOR CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. UNHEALTHY PRACTICES SUCH AS USING UNSANITARY REPLACEMENTS FOR PADS AND TAMPONS AS WELL AS STIGMATIZATION OF MENSTRUATION IMPORTANT MATTER THAT HAVE REAL CONSEQUENCES ON OUR EDUCATION THUS HAVING FOR. FREE AND AVAILABLE NATURAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS ARE NECESSITY THAT MUST BE PRIORITIZE. THE WE RECOGNIZE THE EFFORT OF AB TEN WHICH TARGETS TITLE ONE SCHOOLS WERE IN SPECIAL NEED OF THESE PRODUCTS. WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS 26% OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AT SCHOOLS THAT DON'T QUALIFY AS HOW TO ONE SCHOOLS. AS WELL AS STUDENTS OF ALL SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS YOU MAY SIMPLY BE IN NEED OF A PAD OR TAMPON. WE PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT TO THE SECTION THIRTY FIVE TWENTY NINE TWO POINT SIX OF THE EDUCATION CODE. TO MANDATE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA SCHOOL SERVING THINK SIX THROUGH TWELVE GRADE STUDENTS PROVIDE FREE NATURAL HIGH YOU PRODUCTS AN ALL WOMEN'S. FACULTY GENDER NEUTRAL AS WELL AS A LEAST ONE MEN'S RESTROOM. THIS PROPOSAL WAS SERVE AROUND ONE POINT FIVE MILLION STUDENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. YOUR FIVE REASONS TO A DOCTOR SOLUTION FIRST REGARDLESS OF SOCIO ECONOMIC CLASS. MANY MEN TREATING INDIVIDUALS ARE CAUGHT WITHOUT MITCHELL PRODUCTS. BY HAVING FREE MESHEL PRODUCTS IN SCHOOLS HE REDUCE THE HUMILIATION THAT STUDENTS WOULD FACE WITHOUT SUCH PRODUCTS. SECOND IN ACCESSIBILITY TO METRO PRODUCTS CAN LEAD STUDENTS TO UTILIZE UNSAFE PRACTICES. SUCH AS NOT CHANGING THEIR TAMPONS FREQUENTLY ENOUGH. THIS CHOICE CAN LEAD TO AN INCREASED RISK OF INFERTILITY CERVICAL CANCER AND TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME WHICH CAN BE FATAL. IN ADDITION OTHER MENTIONING INDIVIDUALS RESORT TO USING SOCKS AND OTHER UNHYGIENIC ALTERNATIVES. THIRD THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FREE HYGIENE PRODUCTS IN ALL FACULTY GENDER NEUTRAL AND AT LEAST ONE MEN'S RUSH ME WHEN MAIL THAT'S NAY ABOUT THEM AND KNOWLEDGE IS THAT NOT ALL MEN TREATING INDIVIDUALS. IS FEMALE DECIMATED RESTROOMS WHICH- INCREASES RGB TQ PLUS INCLUSIVITY. THE PRESENCE OF MENTAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS THE MAIL DOES NEED BATHROOMS ALSO NORMALIZES ANDY STIGMATIZES MINISTRATION. FOURTH MESHEL HYGIENE PRODUCTS ARE A NECESSITY NOT A LUXURY THESE PRODUCTS THE TERM AND TO WHAT EXTENT MENTORING STUDENTS CAN PARTICIPATE IN SCHOOL. MENSTRUATION IS NOT A CHOICE WE PROVIDE TOILET PAPER IN BATHROOMS OF SCHOOLS IN CAMP ONE SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT. THE STAFF CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZES THESE PRODUCTS AS A NECESSITY TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS FOR FREE IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND EVEN IN THIS VERY BUILDING. HOWEVER HOWEVER AS A STATE WE NEED TO DO MORE NOT HAVING ACCESS TO THESE VITAL MEDICAL NECESSITIES THAT'S WILL CREATE AN ADDITIONAL BARRIER TO MENTION INDIVIDUALS EDUCATION. FIFTH A LACK OF FREE MENTAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS CAUSES ABSENCES THAT COULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN AVOIDED IMPEDING UPON A MEASURING INDIVIDUALS ABILITY TO RECEIVE AN EDUCATION. THIS PROPOSAL MUST BE IMPLEMENTED REGARDLESS OF COST AS FOR BITING HYGIENE PRODUCTS WILL RESULT IN HIGHER ATTENDANCE RATES THEREBY INCREASING SCHOOL FUNDING AND ALLOW DISTRICTS TO DESK NAME MORE RESOURCES TO STUDENT IMPROVING THE OVERALL QUALITY OF STUDENTS EDUCATION. THE INCREASED FINDING WILL ALSO COVER THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PIONEER IN PROGRESSIVE REFORM MOVEMENT SUCH AS ASSEMBLY BILL TEN HOWEVER OTHER STATES SUCH AS NEW YORK NEW HAMPSHIRE AND ILLINOIS HAVE ALL RECENTLY ADOPTED NEW LEGISLATION MANDATING FREE MENTAL HYGIENE LESSER PASS CALIFORNIA'S. FORTUNATELY WE ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE LEADERS MANY OF WHOM ARE PRESENT HERE TODAY THE REAL LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATES FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. FOR EXAMPLE STATE LEGISLATORS OF RECENTLY REPEAL THE SEX SALES TAX TAX ON TAMPONS AND OTHER SANITARY PRODUCTS. THIS LONGER REDUCE THAT RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF HYGIENE PRODUCTS AS A NECESSITY RATHER THAN A LUXURY. WE STRONGLY URGE THAT THIS SECTION OF THE EDUCATION COULD BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE ALL WOMEN FACULTY GENDER NEUTRAL AND AS WELL AS WHAT AND MEN'S BATHROOM IN ORDER TO PAVE THE WAY FOR MORE EXAMPLES SCHOOL BASIS SOME. INCLUSIVE OF ALL. YOU FOR YOUR TIME WE KNOW OF NO OR FOR ANY QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. YOU ARE A VERY TOPICAL FOR SURE. ISSUE THIS BODY HAS WRESTLED WITH FOR SOME TIME- AND VERY WELL PRESENTED. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. WELL. HE DID A REALLY EXCELLENT JOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD ASK YOU IF YOU'RE PROPOSAL FOR LEGISLATION WERE TO BE TAKEN UP BY. SOMEONE AND MOVED. WHAT DO YOU WHAT WOULD YOU FIND YOURSELVES DOING TO SUPPORT THAT AND HELP MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS. PASSED AND SIGNED- OFFICE THE AS WE ALL RESIDE IN VERY- CALIFORNIA I THINK THE FIRST THAT WOULD BE TAKING THIS TO OUR INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS AND MAKING SURE THAT THESE THINGS ARE IMPLEMENTED- AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS KIND OF A TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT WERE WHEN ONE SCHOOL SEARCH DOING AT OTHER SCHOOLS HERE ABOUT IT AND OTHER SCHOOLS ARE DOING TO. ANY OTHER I'M WE CAN ALSO START AND SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN TO RAISE AWARENESS AND HAVE PUT MORE PEOPLE SUPPORT THE ISSUE. I MEAN I WOULD JUST WILL RAISE AWARENESS FOR HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE I LIVE IN HOPEFULLY FOLLOW ON THE BILL IF IT WERE TO BE TAKEN UP. IN FOLLOWS WHEREVER IT GOES. WELL I JUST SAY BECAUSE AS- AS OUR CHAIRMAN- MENTIONED- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOME VERSION OF THIS HAS BEEN TAKEN UP AND IT REALLY TAKES A LOT OF HARD WORK- I THINK IT WOULD BE WORTH. YOUR TIME AND EFFORT AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM- BUT IT IT REALLY TAKES A LOT OF CONSCIOUSNESS. RAISING OF AND IT ALSO YOU KNOW IT'S A PERSONAL- PERSONAL SO IT IT'S HARD TO GET THE TESTIMONIES. OF BETTER NEEDED TO HIGHLIGHT THE ISSUE OTHERWISE IT BECOMES SOMETHING THAT'S DETACHED. SO I HAVE FOUND THAT THE MORE PERSONAL STORIES ARE WHICH IN THIS CASE IS DIFFICULT TO DO. THE BUT THE MORE EFFECTIVE. THE MESSAGE IS ABOUT THE AGENCY. TO DEAL WITH IT AND TO RESOLVE IT SO. THE JUST THINKING BACK IN MY YOUNGER DAYS- AND YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIVE IN POVERTY. WHAT IT IS SO WHAT IT DOES TO. TO SOMEONE. TO NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD LIKE YOU SAID HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THIS YOU HAVE TO CREATE SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO MAKE. MAKE SOMETHING. UP TO BE ABLE TO USE IT BECAUSE THE MONEY'S NOT THERE. MONIES THEY'RE BARELY FOR FOOD. SO I THINK YOU'VE YOU'VE RAISED A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES CONNECTED TO THIS. MMHM CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU YOU. IN CENTER YES. HAS AWESOME HAD TO LEAVE NOW I'M HERE PERMANENTLY. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS UP I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE- WE HAVE HYGIENE PRODUCTS IN BOTH OF MY DISTRICT OFFICES ARE JUST IN CASE SOMEONE WERE TO NEED SOMETHING AS THE EXPENSE IS AN ISSUE- TO DO IT STATE WIDE DOESN'T MEAN IT SHOULD PROHIBIT US FROM DOING IT JUST MEANS WE SHOULD BE COGNIZANT OF THAT. I AGREE WITH SENATOR TO ROSS SO HAVING- STORIES HAVING- TESTIMONY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- ANY BILL THAT WE DO IN THIS BUILDING WHEN WE HAVE REAL STORIES AND REAL PEOPLE IT MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE SO THINK ABOUT WHO YOU CAN GET WILL KIND OF TESTIMONY YOU CAN GET- IT'S HIS TO SHARE THE STORY. OF BIG AND I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS INJURED HI. A LONG TIME AGO AND YOU. THAT SEE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S GONNA KNOW AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR YOUNG WOMAN WOMEN AND THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THERE- AND I THINK WHAT IT ALSO DOES IS IF IT'S IF WE OFFER THESE PRODUCTS FOR FREE- AND THEY'RE AVAILABLE I THINK IT TAKES AWAY SOME STIGMA BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOUNG WOMEN STILL FEEL BAD ABOUT HAVING THEIR PERIOD- WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT. BUT I DO REMEMBER I DID AND SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE ALSO SENATOR TO ROSS SO SAID- YOU ARE FROM A FAMILY THAT BARELY HAS MONEY TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. WHO CAN AFFORD A TEN DOLLAR BOX OF TAMPONS OR PAY OUR PADS SO WE CAN DO BETTER AS A STATE AND NOW WE JUST WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. AND I WANT TO THINK ABOUT. DEMONA IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOMEONE WHO'S FRONT UP THEY CAN BE. US SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL BETTER ABOUT THAT THAN ACTUALLY BEING IN PERSON WHICH IS FINE BUT THE MORE STORIES THAT WE HAVE THE MORE HELPFUL IT WILL BE SO THANK YOU FOR BEING THOUGHTFUL AND BRINGING THIS FORWARD. WELL VERY WELL PRESENTED YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOURSELVES WE ARE PROUD OF YOU A GREAT JOB. OUR NEXT PANEL- IS- THE YOUTH EMPOWERMENT ACT. WE JUST HAVE ONE SPEAKER ON THAT ONE IF I'M CORRECT. WELCOME AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. THERE'S A LOT OF CHURCHES. TERMINAL DONAL. YOUR WOMAN LEYVA THE STEAM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JASON CHAN I AM SIXTEEN YEARS OLD I'M A JUNIOR WALL HIGH SCHOOL IN SAN FRANCISCO- I'M ALSO THE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS SUMMIT CHARTER THE FOLLOW UP FOR ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS- ADDITIONALLY AT THIS CONFERENCE I FILLED THE ROLE. OF RESEARCH TEAM LEAD. WHERE I MADE SURE THAT PROPOSALS ARE HIGH QUALITY FOLLOW EDUCATION COMMUNITY TRENDS ARE WELL RESEARCH AND- ARE TRULY IMPLEMENTABLE WHILE STILL ENCOMPASSING WHAT STUDENTS TRULY WANT TO DO- I'M HERE- TODAY TO DISCUSS YOUTH EMPOWERMENT. SO I JUST WANTED TO REAFFIRM THAT WHILE SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY EITHER HAVE COST IMPLICATIONS OR NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. THESE SIX TOPICS ARE THE ISSUES THAT WE AS STUDENTS DECIDED WHERE THE MOST IMPROPER THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM TODAY. THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS ITS CITIZENS FACE JUST AS THE EDUCATION SYSTEM SHOULD ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS IT'S STUDENTS FACE. LIKE HOW VOTERS INFORMED DECISIONS THE GOVERNMENT MAKES STUDENTS NEED TO INFORM DECISIONS THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM X. OUR PROBLEMS THAT WE IDENTIFY OURSELVES SHOULD HAVE THE HEAVIEST WEIGHT. IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS WITHIN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND WITH DOT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT- THIS BILL THAT WE'VE CREATED- OUR GOVERNING BODY THE STATE COUNCIL WHICH IS CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF YOUTH CROFTER THE PROPOSAL CALLED THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH EMPOWERMENT ACT- AND IT WAS PICKED UP BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOSE RIVAS AND CENTER SCOTT WIENER- TODAY IT WAS INTRODUCED TODAY. AB FIFTY EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT IT WOULD CREATE THE FIRST STATEWIDE ADVISORY BOARD CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF YOU. SO I'D JUST LIKE TO START WITH PERSONAL STORY IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY I GET NEWS ALERTS FOR NEW SCHOOL SHOOTING OR ANOTHER REPORT. THAT AN IRREVERSIBLE PACE ABOUT THE IRREVERSIBLE PACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S SCARY NOT KNOWING ABOUT MY OWN SAFETY IN MY OWN SCHOOL OR ON THIS PLANET FOR ETERNITY. YOUNG PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE ANGRY. THEY WANT TO MAKE A CHANGE BUT THEY FEEL POWERLESS THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T LISTEN TO US THEY SAY. WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER OUR FUTURE. AND SO THE SOLUTION THAT WE CAME UP WITH IS IT'S HOT IT'S TIME TO EMPOWER OUR YOUTH. SO THE SPECIFICS OF THIS BILL- THE YOUTH EMPOWERMENT ACT WOULD CREATE THE FIRST STATEWIDE YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD IT CONSISTS OF TWENTY FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE FROM AGES FOURTEEN THROUGH TWENTY FIVE. AT LEAST. HALF OF THE MEMBERS HAVE TO BE UNDER EIGHTEEN HALF OF THEM HAVE TO BE OVER EIGHTEEN. IF THE COME FROM GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS FROM ALL ACROSS THE STATE. TO THERE HAS TO BE TO- COMMISSIONERS FROM EVERY EVERY DISTRICT ARE ON THE STATE. ARM AND SOMETHING THAT WERE PARTICULARLY PRODUCT IS A PROVISION THAT AT LEAST HALF OF THE MEMBERS ON THE COMMISSION HALF HAVE EXPERIENCE LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH YOUTH HOMELESSNESS FOSTER CARE DISABILITIES OR JUVENILE INCARCERATION. THE IDEA OF THIS BILL IS TRULY TO UPLIFT THOSE UNDER REPRESENTED VOICES THAT THAT TYPICALLY NEVER GET A SAY IN OUR CURRENT EDUCATION SYSTEM A KID IN SAN DIEGO WHO IS- AND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT WOULD NEVER HAVE AND IS IN A VERY LOW SOCIO ECONOMIC CONDITION WOULD NEVER HAVE THE ABILITY TO COME TO SACRAMENTO TO TALK ABOUT THEIR ISSUE. WHICH IS WHY THE COMMISSION IT SHOULD BE X. ENTIRELY COST FREE. AND ADDITIONALLY COMMISSIONERS RECEIVE A THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR PER DIEM TO BE FAIRLY COMPENSATE THEM FOR THE WORK ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SO MANY OF THESE COMMISSIONERS ARE THOSE THAT COME FROM STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES. THE COMMISSION'S MISSION IS TO EMPOWER UNDERREPRESENTED YOUTH WITH A FORMAL OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN THE CALIFORNIA CIVIC PROCESS AND THEY DO THIS USING THREE DIFFERENT ARE THERE TOSS WITH DOING THREE DIFFERENT THINGS. FIRST POLICY DEVELOPMENT SO THAT INCLUDES- WRITING MODEL LEGISLATION. FORMALLY ARTICULATING SUPPORT AND OPPOSE LEGISLATION THEY STUDY IN REVIEW CURRENT DEFICIENCIES REGARDING YOUTH AND THE PROVIDE TESTIMONY I'D HEARINGS TO PROMOTE THE SERVICES FOR THE EMPOWERMENT OF ALL YOUNG PEOPLE. THIS IS KIND OF LIKE THE SABLE FORMAT BUT HAVING A FORMAL. HAVING A FORMAL PART IN THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S YEAR ROUND AND THAT'S SUSTAINABLE AND FUNDED ENTIRELY BY THE GOVERNMENT. SECOND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SO NOT ONLY WILL THE STUDENTS MAKE THE DECISIONS BASED ON THEIR OWN ASSUMPTIONS THEY'RE ALSO TASKED WITH REACHING OUT TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND LEARNING ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED. THEY CAN DO THIS BY HOLDING THEIR COMMISSION MEETINGS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. THEY CAN DO THIS BY ENGAGING WITH EXISTING LOCAL YOUTH ADVISORY BOARDS LOCAL USE COMMISSIONS- LOCAL USE PROGRAMS LIKE TEAM PROGRAMS ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF AND ACCESSING STUDENTS DIRECTLY WHERE THEY ARE WHICH IS PLAYED WHICH ARE PLACES LIKE SCHOOL ASSEMBLIES. AND EXCITER EXCITER. ADDITIONALLY NOT ONLY ARE THE TWENTY FOUR MEMBERS ENGAGED AND EMPOWERED. THERE'S ALSO A RIPPLE EFFECT THAT COMES FROM THIS BECAUSE. BECAUSE THERE'S A RIPPLE EFFECT BECAUSE AS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BEING EXPOSED TO USE COMMISSION THEY LEARN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT ABOUT GETTING YOUR VOICE IN WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS AND THE TRUE POWER OF DEMOCRACY- ADDITIONALLY THE COMMISSION CAN APPOINT. OTHER MEMBERS BETTER YOUNG PEOPLE TO SPECIFIC ISSUE AREA VISOR BOARDS- AS WELL AS- YOUTH AMBASSADORS THAT REPRESENT A PARTICULAR DISTRICT OR CITY OR WHAT HAVE YOU ALL THAT DEPENDS ON THE COMMISSION BUT THEY HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO. THE THIRD IS INVESTMENT IN USE AND THIS IS A PRETTY NEW IDEA- IT'S CALLED YOU FLOOD PHILANTHROPY AND IT'S GIVING YOU IT'S EMPOWERING YOUTH TO HELP MAKE DECISIONS ON WHERE FUNDING GOES IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT DEAL DIRECTLY WITH YOUNG PEOPLE- THIS IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE CURRENTLY THE BUDGET PROCESS IS VERY DIFFICULT AND HARD TO NAVIGATE BUT I'M SURE THAT THE STATE WANTS TO INVEST. IN PROGRAMS THAT WORK ON A LOCAL LEVEL A LOT OF THESE NON PROFITS DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM SO A LOT OF THEM AREN'T ABLE TO GET TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE STATE'S FUNDS SO THIS FOLLOWS THE DIRECTION OF THE- CALIFORNIA ARTS COMMISSION. WHICH GETS AROUND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND THEY DID GIVE OUT MONEY THEY GIVE OUT STATE FUNDS TO LOCAL ARTISTS TO HELP ENHANCE ARTISTS ALL ACROSS THE STATE THIS WOULD APPLY THAT SAME LOGIC BUT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND ALL THE- PROGRAMS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE. PARTICIPATE IN TODAY. AB DEAL DIRECTLY WITH KIDS THAT ARE IN THE JUVENILE INCARCERATION SYSTEM PROGRAMS THAT ARE DEALING WITH KIDS IN FOSTER CARE ALL THOSE NON PROFITS THEY NEED THE SUPPORT. AND THEY'RE VERY LOW FUNDED BUT I KNOW THE STATE WANTS TO FUND THEM BUT THERE IS THE COMPLICATED LESS THAT PROCESS THAT CAN BE OVER RUN BY THIS AND FURTHER MORE. HELPS EMPOWER YOUNG PEOPLE TO HELP MAKE THOSE DECISIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THE COMMISSION IS OUT- JUST SOME PRECEDENT. THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY LOCAL YOUTH COMMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA- FROM DIFFERENT MUNICIPALITIES AND OVER TWENTY OTHER STATES ALREADY HAVE STATE MANDATED USE COMMISSIONS. THIS INCLUDES STATES LIKE MASSACHUSETTS AND MARYLAND BUT EVEN STATES LIKE NEBRASKA AND LOUISIANA AND I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING BAD ABOUT THEM THAT WAS JUST. FIGURE OF SPEECH BUT- CALIFORNIA SHOULD REALLY BE LEADING THE CHARGE ON THIS WE ARE BEHIND- SO I'M HERE TODAY PRESENTED TO YOU THIS PROPOSAL TO ASK EACH ONE OF YOU. TO SIGN ON AS A CO AUTHOR TO THIS BILL. DOING SO WOULD DEMONSTRATE TAKING A CRITICAL STEP TO EMPOWER OUR STATE'S YOUTH. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT ALL YOU GUYS DONE FOR THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND I'M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS OR CÃ¹NG COMMENTS OR CONCERNS GREAT. THANK YOU SO THE ROLE YOU THE COMMISSION WHEN YOU MAKE- SOME RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE YOUR WAY ON BOTH OUR POLICY AND GET. AND JUST AS EDUCATION ALL. YEAH SO. IT YOUTH ITSELF IS A VERY BROAD TERM- WE ORGANIZE THAT USING THREE INTERCONNECTED GOALS WITH FOCUSES ON SAVING GAUGE MEANT. EDUCATION SOCIALLY QUALITY SOCIAL SERVICES WORKER SO MY QUESTION IS OKAY. MY QUESTION IS YOU WANT- THE YOUTH COMMISSION TO BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN IN IN IN A IN A BROADER. AND POLICIES NOT JUST THE EDUCATIONAL BUT POLICIES YOUTH RELATED POLICY UNDERSTOOD GOT GOT A GOOD- OKAY I GET THAT AND THOSE SHERRY WE ASK PEOPLE TO CO AUTHOR. TELL ME WHAT WE'RE GONNA SAY IS ONCE YOU SEND YOUR LANGUAGE OVER TO US AND WE'LL HAVE OUR STAFF AT IT LOOK AT IT. BECAUSE YOU JUST AGREE TO SIGN ON TO SOMEONE'S BILL THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING BURIED IN THERE THAT'S THAT THEY DO YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE OR MIGHT NOT BE SO POSITIVE ABOUT SAYING THIS IS THE CASE WITH THIS BILL FOR SURE YEAH. BUT SOMETIMES THERE IS AND SOMETIMES WE LEARN THINGS OF THE AUTHOR OF A BILL DIDN'T TELL US WAS BURIED IN A BILL. THAT MAYBE- YOU KNOW WE SHOULD HAVE NO BEFORE YOU SIGN ON TO ABOUT. SO IN THE HEART. HEY WE ASK SOMEONE TO SIGN A- BILL. CO AUTHOR BILL LET ME SIGN ON MEANS CO AUTHOR BELTON. WITH THEIR NAME ON IT THAT YOU HAVE YOU GET OVER YOUR STAFF AND HAVE THEM READ BECAUSE THEY'RE THE BRAINS OF THE OPERATION. YEAH AND IN THE- IN THE POCKET. SHOULD THE LEGISLATIVE INFORMATION. OR THE ACTUAL THANK YOU. A SET RAZA DID YOU HAVE ANY A QUESTION ABOUT THE- GEOGRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION. I CAN IMAGINE THE- THE- THE CHALLENGE OF GETTING REPRESENTATION FROM. EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF THE FROM LOS ANGELES. OF THE COUNTY OF TEN MILLION PEOPLE. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SEE HAVING NOT HAVING MORE REPRESENTATION- IS ALSO GREAT I THINK DIVERSITY AND A LOT OF OTHER. ISSUES SO IT'S JUST ONE ISSUE AS THE CHAIRMAN SAYS ABOUT. THERE'S A LOT YOU KNOW TO READ HERE BUT I DO WANT TO COMMEND YOU I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU COME TO CHALLENGE US AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT. ON THE ONE HAND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THERE THE OTHER STATES AND- THAT HAVE DONE THIS ON THE OTHER HAND WHY HAVEN'T WE DONE IT SOONER SO. I AM. VIRTUAL YOU KNOW THE CONCEPT VERY MUCH OF. WHAT WE'LL LOOK AT THAT FOR OTHER. AND SO IN TERMS OF THE JUROR OFF LOCATIONS- WE DIVIDED IT INTO TEN DIFFERENT REGIONS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE US CENSUS BUREAU- SO I THINK. IN THE BILL LANGUAGE IT SPECIFIES THAT LOS ANGELES COUNTY ITSELF IS ONE REASON WHILE LIKE UPPER NORTH WHERE THERE'S LESS POPULATION MULTIPLE COUNTIES ARE IN THAT ONE REGION SO IN THE LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE WE- THAT. LIKE IF IT'S BEEN CONSIDERED. GREAT EXCELLENT UP SENATOR. I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU ALL DO YOUR HOMEWORK YOU JUST CONTINUE TO IMPRESS US EVERY YEAR- YEAH NO PROBLEM WE LOOK AT THE CENSUS AND THIS IS WHAT WE CAME UP WITH- AND I DO ONE LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AND THEN ONCE I READ OVER AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR SO THANK YOU. VERY THANK YOU VERY WELL DONE HE'S COMMISSION MERRY WILL LIKE IT THANK YOU. I'M WITH THAT. TWO EVENTS. I WE HAVE CLOSING REMARKS. FROM. RIGHT SO OF IDEA FROM HIGH TECH HIGH- BUT BEFORE YOU CLOSE I JUST WANTED TO THE WORLD IN A VERY GOOD JOB ALL THESE PANELS OF DONE THEIR HOMEWORK- NOT ALL LEGISLATORS TO- YOUR MANY OF YOUR CONCEPTS- HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE DEVOLVED IN THOSE THAT ARE BROUGHT TO ME BY MANY IN THIS BODY. TRUE. THIS IS A GUY AND YOU YOU DIDN'T TRY AND FIX IT UP ONSTAGE RIGHT HERE OR SAY WILL JUST PASS IT AND YOU KNOW I'LL FIX IT LATER- THAT'S ONE THING THAT HER DRESS PEOPLE AROUND A LITTLE CRAZY- SO I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS WHAT THEY DID- THE AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT WENT INTO THAT. AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO ONCE AGAIN COMMEND ESTEEM SHARES LEYVA AND O'DONNELL. CHIEF CONSULTANT FINALLY REMAIN AND LORBER. AND THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ON EDUCATION FOR LISTENING TO OUR PROPOSALS FROM THIS YEAR'S SABLE CONFERENCE. AND I SINCERELY HOPE THAT FAIRLY SHORT VERY SHORTLY WE CAN TRAIN OUR PROPOSALS INTO ACTIONS IMPLEMENTED BY ALL OF YOU. AND THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ON EDUCATION THANK YOU SO MUCH.
