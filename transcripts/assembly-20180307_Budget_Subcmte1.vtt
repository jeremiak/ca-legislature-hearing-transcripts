TO MAKE WHAT'S CONSIDERED A SAFE

TO SERVE DETERMINATION. WHICH

00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:51.195 region:rollup2

PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY

00:48:57.334 --> 00:49:02.072 region:rollup2
INCARCERATED. ON. WE BELIEVE

00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:04.942 region:rollup2
THAT THAT TIME PERIOD IS WAY TOO

00:49:02.072 --> 00:49:06.610 region:rollup2
LONG TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND

00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:08.612 region:rollup2
WE WOULD ASK THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:10.915 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. CALM

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:12.883 region:rollup2
WITHIN THIRTY DAYS WHICH IS

00:49:10.915 --> 00:49:14.318 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH A LOT OF OTHER

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:16.253 region:rollup2
TIME LINES IN OUR SYSTEM AROUND

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:17.054 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENTS AND

00:49:16.253 --> 00:49:19.623 region:rollup2
MAKING OTHER KINDS OF

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:21.492 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS. ON WE WOULD ALSO

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:24.962 region:rollup2
ASK THAT THE CLIENT'S RIGHTS

00:49:21.492 --> 00:49:27.631 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES ON OUR NOTICED OF ALL

00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:28.265 region:rollup2
OF THOSE DECISIONS. ON THE

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:30.734 region:rollup2
RECENT TEST

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:32.870 region:rollup2
TO SPEED UP THAT DETERMINATION

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:35.806 region:rollup2
IS THAT UNFORTUNATELY IF SOMEONE

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:38.943 region:rollup2
IS FOUND NOT SAFE TO SERVE. ON

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:41.412 region:rollup2
THE NEXT STEPS TO DEVELOPING AN

00:49:38.943 --> 00:49:43.080 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT FOR THEM.

00:49:41.412 --> 00:49:44.815 region:rollup2
ALL OFTEN.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:47.751 region:rollup2
CAN BE VERY TIME CONSUMING AND

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:49.954 region:rollup2
SO IF WE'VE ALREADY HAD SOMEONE

00:49:47.751 --> 00:49:51.755 region:rollup2
SITTING DOWN IN AN APPROPRIATE

00:49:49.954 --> 00:49:53.791 region:rollup2

WHEN WE BEGAN. TO INVESTIGATE

00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:57.628 region:rollup2
WHAT OUR NEXT STEPS ARE THAT.

00:49:56.227 --> 00:49:59.630 region:rollup2
DELAYS THE PROCESS

00:49:57.628 --> 00:50:01.398 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY SO THE SOONER THAT

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:02.666 region:rollup2
ON THAT DETERMINATION CAN BE

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:04.101 region:rollup2
MADE THE SOONER THAT IF THAT

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:06.470 region:rollup2
PERSON IS DENIED ADMISSION WE

00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:08.038 region:rollup2
CAN BEGIN DEVELOPING OUT ANOTHER

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:09.974 region:rollup2
PLAN FOR THEM.

00:50:08.038 --> 00:50:11.942 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:50:09.974 --> 00:50:13.177 region:rollup2
I'M JUST ONE QUESTION BEFORE WE

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:15.546 region:rollup2
TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTED SEEMED

00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:17.348 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU MENTIONED THIRTY DAYS

AND THAT WE HAVE A TWENTY ONE

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:23.254 region:rollup2
DAY LIMIT SO WANTED TO CLARIFY

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:25.956 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS APPROPRIATE OR WHICH.

00:50:23.254 --> 00:50:27.524 region:rollup2
WAS RIGHT AND SO ON IT YOU KNOW

00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:29.126 region:rollup2
I'M I KNOW EARLY ON WE HAVE

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:31.295 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ABOUT A TWENTY ONE DAY

00:50:29.126 --> 00:50:32.830 region:rollup2
TIME LIMIT. AND THEN ON IN

00:50:31.295 --> 00:50:35.432 region:rollup2
REVIEWING OTHER STATUTE

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:38.202 region:rollup2
STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FORUMS

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:41.005 region:rollup2
THIRTY SEEMED UPON.

00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:42.740 region:rollup2
BUT THE MOST OFTEN USED NUMBER

00:50:41.005 --> 00:50:45.643 region:rollup2
ON FOR A LOT OF THINGS THAT COME

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:47.177 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE

00:50:45.643 --> 00:50:48.579 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS OUR OTHER

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:50.548 region:rollup2
NEEDS THAT MAKE THEM MORE

00:50:48.579 --> 00:50:52.249 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING TO SERVE. ON AND SO

00:50:50.548 --> 00:50:52.850 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THAT NUMBER WAS MORE

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:54.385 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:55.553 region:rollup2
WILL LAST FOR A RESPONSE BUT

00:50:54.385 --> 00:50:57.454 region:rollup2
AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT IF WE CAN

00:50:55.553 --> 00:51:01.825 region:rollup2
SO WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC

00:50:57.454 --> 00:51:03.494 region:rollup2
COMMENT ON ISSUE ONE.

00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:05.362 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE WE WILL BRING IT

00:51:03.494 --> 00:51:07.031 region:rollup2
BACK UP TO THE DYESS AND NOW I

00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:09.566 region:rollup2
WOULD HOPEFULLY HAVE THE

00:51:07.031 --> 00:51:12.303 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT RESPONDS TO. A WHAT

00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:13.804 region:rollup2
WE COULD DO TO TRY TO MEET THE

00:51:12.303 --> 00:51:15.339 region:rollup2
EXPECTATION OF THIRTY DAYS.

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:16.707 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE FIVE OR SIX MONTHS AS

00:51:15.339 --> 00:51:18.375 region:rollup2
A WHILE BUT.

00:51:16.707 --> 00:51:21.412 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN DOYLE

00:51:18.375 --> 00:51:23.681 region:rollup2
DTS ON WHAT WE APPRECIATE DRC'S

00:51:21.412 --> 00:51:24.848 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT REGARDING THE

00:51:23.681 --> 00:51:26.817 region:rollup2
LENGTH OF TIME IT COULD

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:28.886 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY TAKE IT AND JUST TO

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:31.088 region:rollup2
BE CLEAR. FIVE OR SIX MONTHS IS

00:51:28.886 --> 00:51:32.423 region:rollup2
NOT A TIME PERIOD THAT'S A LATIN

00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:34.925 region:rollup2
STATUTE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

00:51:32.423 --> 00:51:37.661 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IT TAKES ABOUT SEVENTY

00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:39.797 region:rollup2
FOUR DAYS TO DO AN ASSESSMENT OF

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:41.665 region:rollup2

COMMITTED TO PORTER BILL.

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:45.636 region:rollup2
SO IN THAT SEVENTY FOUR DAYS

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:47.571 region:rollup2
INCLUDES THE TIME THAT IT TAKES

00:51:45.636 --> 00:51:49.173 region:rollup2
TO GET A COURT ORDER. TO VISIT

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:50.908 region:rollup2
THE INDIVIDUAL IN JAIL TO BEGIN

00:51:49.173 --> 00:51:53.944 region:rollup2
THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS.

00:51:50.908 --> 00:51:55.546 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT.

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:57.214 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN BED SUPPORTER

00:51:55.546 --> 00:51:58.148 region:rollup2
BILL CURRENTLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

00:51:57.214 --> 00:52:00.117 region:rollup2
OF FULL.

00:51:58.148 --> 00:52:01.819 region:rollup2
SO ON.

00:52:00.117 --> 00:52:03.921 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE GOT A REFERRAL LIST OF

00:52:01.819 --> 00:52:06.123 region:rollup2
NINE INDIVIDUAL SO. IT'S NOT AN

00:52:03.921 --> 00:52:08.158 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT WE DON'T HAVE SPACE

00:52:06.123 --> 00:52:08.692 region:rollup2
TO PUT PEOPLE IT'S THE TIME THAT

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:10.628 region:rollup2
IT TAKES TO DO A THOROUGH

00:52:08.692 --> 00:52:12.296 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT. AND ONE OF THINGS I

00:52:10.628 --> 00:52:14.398 region:rollup2
THINK WE WOULD ALSO ONE NOTE IS

00:52:12.296 --> 00:52:16.500 region:rollup2
THAT FOR INDIVIDUALS. WHO

00:52:14.398 --> 00:52:17.668 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY COULD BE UNSAFE TO

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.303 region:rollup2
SERVE?

00:52:17.668 --> 00:52:20.771 region:rollup2
YOU'RE WE WITH THEIR OTHER RISK

00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:22.806 region:rollup2
FACTORS THAT WE LOOK AT SO WE

00:52:20.771 --> 00:52:25.242 region:rollup2
WANNA KNOW. ON YOU DON'T IT

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:28.545 region:rollup2
DESERVES INDIVIDUALS BEHAVIORS.

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:31.315 region:rollup2
POSE A RISK TO THAT RESIDENTS OR

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:33.417 region:rollup2
THE STAFF AT PORTERVILLE. OWN

00:52:31.315 --> 00:52:34.418 region:rollup2
ARE THERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

00:52:33.417 --> 00:52:35.586 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PREDOMINANT IS THE

00:52:34.418 --> 00:52:37.321 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL MORE APPROPRIATE

00:52:35.586 --> 00:52:39.723 region:rollup2
PLACED IN A STATE HOSPITAL.

00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:42.159 region:rollup2
ON.

00:52:39.723 --> 00:52:43.927 region:rollup2
IS THE INDIVIDUAL ACTION RISK OF

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:45.496 region:rollup2
INJURY BECAUSE OF IT AT A PRE

00:52:43.927 --> 00:52:47.197 region:rollup2
EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS SO.

00:52:45.496 --> 00:52:49.133 region:rollup2
.

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:50.167 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE ARE.

00:52:49.133 --> 00:52:51.835 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING I THINK WE ALSO

00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:54.671 region:rollup2
NOTED SIT DOWN.

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:56.140 region:rollup2
THE CASESARE VERY COMPLEX AND

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:57.808 region:rollup2
THEY'RE USUALLY CONTRADICTORY

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:59.877 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS.

00:52:57.808 --> 00:53:01.845 region:rollup2
ARM SO THAT THIRTY DAYS OFTEN

00:52:59.877 --> 00:53:03.213 region:rollup2
ISN'T ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE A

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:04.982 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION WHETHER THE

00:53:03.213 --> 00:53:07.051 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL OF SAFE TO SERVE.

00:53:04.982 --> 00:53:08.752 region:rollup2
AND.

00:53:07.051 --> 00:53:10.054 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE THE DEPARTMENT USES

00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:11.755 region:rollup2
A PERSON CENTERED PLANNING

00:53:10.054 --> 00:53:14.191 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:15.559 region:rollup2
ARE GETTING THE APPROPRIATE

00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:17.695 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IT BUT ME.

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:19.530 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT

00:53:17.695 --> 00:53:21.598 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL IS ACTIVELY ENGAGE

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:23.767 region:rollup2
WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER. ALSO

00:53:21.598 --> 00:53:25.669 region:rollup2
MAKES A DIFFERENCE AS FAR AS HOW

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:27.237 region:rollup2
QUICKLY DID SUSSMAN CAN BE DONE.

00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:29.006 region:rollup2
AND I THINK FINALLY I WOULD NOTE

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:31.575 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW SINCE TWO THOUSAND

00:53:29.006 --> 00:53:33.110 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN. WE'VE HAD ONE

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:35.446 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:37.014 region:rollup2
A DETERMINATION ON AND NOT

00:53:35.446 --> 00:53:38.549 region:rollup2
SAFETY SERB ASSESSMENT SO. I

00:53:37.014 --> 00:53:40.951 region:rollup2
WOULD I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:41.552 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:43.053 region:rollup2
OF CASES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL

00:53:41.552 --> 00:53:44.988 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:46.790 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANYTHING ON THE STATE

00:53:44.988 --> 00:53:49.593 region:rollup2
SIDE WE CAN DO TO HELP WITH

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:51.328 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD TO HELP LOWER SOME OF

00:53:49.593 --> 00:53:54.364 region:rollup2
THAT TIME FRAME AND.

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:56.533 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:57.868 region:rollup2
SO AT THIS FANCY APARTMENT YOU

00:53:56.533 --> 00:54:00.070 region:rollup2
KNOW AT THIS TIME I THINK THAT

00:53:57.868 --> 00:54:01.505 region:rollup2
THE BEST THING THAT THAT WE CAN

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.706 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DO IS JUST CONTINUE

00:54:01.505 --> 00:54:04.041 region:rollup2
WITH OUR COMMITMENT OF MAKING

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:06.510 region:rollup2
SURE THIS AS.

00:54:04.041 --> 00:54:08.078 region:rollup2
AYE MISTER DOYLE HAD INDICATED

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:10.247 region:rollup2
THAT WHILE THE FIVE AND SIX

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:11.482 region:rollup2
MONTHS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS

00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:13.117 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT ROUTINE IT'S CERTAINLY

00:54:11.482 --> 00:54:15.052 region:rollup2
NOT THERE. THE.

00:54:13.117 --> 00:54:16.353 region:rollup2
STANDARD THAT WE WOULD LOOK TO

00:54:15.052 --> 00:54:17.621 region:rollup2
DO AND SO WITHIN THE STAFF THAT

00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:19.690 region:rollup2
WE HAVE IN OUR EXISTING

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:20.190 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:22.326 region:rollup2
TO.

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:23.694 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT IN EVERY

00:54:22.326 --> 00:54:26.029 region:rollup2
INSTANCE THAT WEEKEND.

00:54:23.694 --> 00:54:28.332 region:rollup2
MEET TIME LINES THAT ARE WITHIN

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:29.666 region:rollup2
OUR ABILITY BASED ON WHAT THE

00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:31.735 region:rollup2
COURT DATES ARE BASED ON THE

00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:32.803 region:rollup2
OTHER FACTORS THAT WE MAY NOT

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:34.071 region:rollup2
HAVE AS MUCH CONTROL LOVE. ON

00:54:32.803 --> 00:54:35.539 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO MAKE

00:54:34.071 --> 00:54:37.174 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE CAN GET FOLKS TO

00:54:35.539 --> 00:54:38.408 region:rollup2
AMEND ASSESSMENT SO WE CAN MAKE

00:54:37.174 --> 00:54:40.544 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE.

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:41.745 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS

00:54:40.544 --> 00:54:43.647 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED SO THE BEST SERVICES

00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:46.250 region:rollup2
CAN BE DONE. SO THAT THE FIVE TO

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:47.684 region:rollup2
SIX MONTHS IS NOT IS IS NOT AN

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:48.685 region:rollup2
AREA IN WHICH WE'VE EVEN

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:51.054 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED.

00:54:48.685 --> 00:54:52.990 region:rollup2
NOR DO I ACTUALLY ANTICIPATE IT

00:54:51.054 --> 00:54:54.625 region:rollup2
TAKING FIVE TO SIX MONTHS SO

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:56.460 region:rollup2
WITH OUR EXISTING RESOURCES WILL

00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:57.227 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO MAKE PRIORITIES TO

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.296 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:54:57.227 --> 00:55:00.831 region:rollup2
ASSESSED. SO THEY CAN REALLY GET

00:54:59.296 --> 00:55:01.965 region:rollup2
TO THE BEST SERVICE OPTIONS THAT

00:55:00.831 --> 00:55:03.066 region:rollup2

HOW WE CALCULATED NET

00:56:16.273 --> 00:56:20.477 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL SAVINGS.

00:56:18.542 --> 00:56:22.212 region:rollup2
SENATE OPERATIONAL SAVINGS WILL

00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:23.881 region:rollup2
RESULT IF THE COST TO SERVE

00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:25.048 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY IS

00:56:23.881 --> 00:56:26.617 region:rollup2
LESS THAN WHAT IT COSTS THE

00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:28.285 region:rollup2
STATE TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS IN

00:56:26.617 --> 00:56:30.087 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS.

00:56:28.285 --> 00:56:31.021 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST THING WE HAD TO DO

00:56:30.087 --> 00:56:33.257 region:rollup2
WAS LOOK AT WILL WHAT DOES IT

00:56:31.021 --> 00:56:34.758 region:rollup2
COST THIS STATE TO SERVE

SO.

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:38.428 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.963 region:rollup2
THE GYM STATE GENERAL FUND

00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:42.232 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL WE CAN'T

00:56:39.963 --> 00:56:43.400 region:rollup2
LOOK AT TOTAL FUNDS AND WE ALSO

00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:44.568 region:rollup2
NEED TO LOOK AT THE COSTS OF THE

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.136 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THAT ARE

00:56:44.568 --> 00:56:46.937 region:rollup2
CLOSING SINCE.

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:48.338 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO FACILITIES THAT

00:56:46.937 --> 00:56:49.907 region:rollup2
WILL REMAIN OPEN.

00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:51.375 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE A NARROW IT DOWN TO

00:56:49.907 --> 00:56:52.776 region:rollup2
THIS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:53.844 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN THE STATE SPENDING

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:55.445 region:rollup2

INDIVIDUALS AT THE DC'S.

00:56:57.781 --> 00:57:00.884 region:rollup2
THE NEXT THING SO THIS IS WHAT

00:56:59.483 --> 00:57:03.487 region:rollup2
YOU CAN THINK OF IS THE AVOIDED

00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:05.122 region:rollup2
COST ONCE THE DISEASE ARE CLOSED

00:57:03.487 --> 00:57:06.223 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO TODAY.

00:57:05.122 --> 00:57:08.058 region:rollup2
THE SECOND THING WE NEED TO LOOK

00:57:06.223 --> 00:57:09.860 region:rollup2
AT IS WHAT IS ACOSTA SERVE

00:57:08.058 --> 00:57:12.362 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:14.197 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE THAT ONCE THE FINAL

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:15.866 region:rollup2
CLOSURES ARE CA ARE COMPLETE THE

00:57:14.197 --> 00:57:17.134 region:rollup2
COST TO SERVE THE REMAINING

00:57:15.866 --> 00:57:19.403 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:57:17.134 --> 00:57:20.771 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL HAVE MOVED

00:57:19.403 --> 00:57:22.539 region:rollup2
FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:24.107 region:rollup2
THROUGH FINAL CLOSURES. WILL BE

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:26.243 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:28.045 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY FROM THE GENERAL FUND

00:57:26.243 --> 00:57:29.079 region:rollup2
THIS INCLUDES COST TO BOTH THE

00:57:28.045 --> 00:57:31.715 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL

00:57:29.079 --> 00:57:32.282 region:rollup2

MEDICARE OF.

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:36.987 region:rollup2
FINALLY WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT

00:57:35.352 --> 00:57:38.989 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE TO

00:57:36.987 --> 00:57:41.124 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SAFETY NET AND CRISIS

00:57:38.989 --> 00:57:42.492 region:rollup2
SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. THESE

00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:44.294 region:rollup2
OUR SERVICES THAT WERE FORMERLY

00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:45.662 region:rollup2
FORMERLY PROVIDED AT FAIRVIEW IN

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:47.664 region:rollup2
CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:49.333 region:rollup2
ONCE THEY'RE CLOSED. THE

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:50.734 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS WORKING TO BUILD

00:57:49.333 --> 00:57:52.869 region:rollup2
UP A SYSTEM IN THE COMMUNITY TO

00:57:50.734 --> 00:57:54.004 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. WE PAID

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:56.873 region:rollup2
BACK COST ABOUT TWENTY FIVE

00:57:54.004 --> 00:58:00.010 region:rollup2
MILLION GENERAL FUND ANNUALLY.

00:57:56.873 --> 00:58:01.078 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S LIKELY THE LEAST

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:02.312 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE WOULD SPEND.

00:58:01.078 --> 00:58:04.481 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR WE

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:08.485 region:rollup2
HAVE SORT OF A A BREAKDOWN.

00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:09.820 region:rollup2
OF THE THE REDUCE COSTS AS WELL

00:58:08.485 --> 00:58:11.121 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THE REDUCE SPENDING IT

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.957 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AS WELL AS

00:58:11.121 --> 00:58:15.492 region:rollup2
THE ESTIMATED COMMUNITY COSTS.

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:17.828 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE THAT THE MOST THE

00:58:15.492 --> 00:58:19.730 region:rollup2
STATE COULD SAVE IN ANNUAL

00:58:17.828 --> 00:58:21.565 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS IS A

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:22.933 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THIS

00:58:21.565 --> 00:58:25.135 region:rollup2
IS AFTER FINAL CLOSURES ARE

00:58:22.933 --> 00:58:26.837 region:rollup2
COMPLETE. AND I WOULD MAKE.

00:58:25.135 --> 00:58:28.739 region:rollup2
TWO IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT THIS

00:58:26.837 --> 00:58:30.841 region:rollup2
CALCULATION ONE IT DOESN'T

00:58:28.739 --> 00:58:32.776 region:rollup2
FACTOR IN THE SORT OF DYNAMIC

00:58:30.841 --> 00:58:34.044 region:rollup2
CHANGES BETWEEN NOW AND FINAL

00:58:32.776 --> 00:58:35.012 region:rollup2
CLOSURE SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT

00:58:34.044 --> 00:58:37.180 region:rollup2
THE REDUCED.

00:58:35.012 --> 00:58:38.715 region:rollup2
COSTS AT DC'S BETWEEN NOW AND

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.417 region:rollup2
THEN BUT WE'RE ALSO NOT LOOKING

00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:43.019 region:rollup2
AT THE SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO THE

00:58:40.417 --> 00:58:44.521 region:rollup2
STATE TO DEVELOP NEW HOMES AND

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:45.889 region:rollup2
RESOURCES OUT MY COMMUNITY.

00:58:44.521 --> 00:58:48.125 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALSO JUST NOTE.

00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:48.792 region:rollup2
THAT THIS ESTIMATE IS HIGHLY

00:58:48.125 --> 00:58:50.527 region:rollup2
VARIABLE.

00:58:48.792 --> 00:58:52.229 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED MILLION IS REALLY THE

00:58:50.527 --> 00:58:54.931 region:rollup2
MOST WE THINK THE STATE COULD

00:58:52.229 --> 00:58:56.333 region:rollup2
SPEND THAT SAFE.

00:58:54.931 --> 00:58:58.568 region:rollup2
NEXT IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE

00:58:56.333 --> 00:59:00.303 region:rollup2
I'LL JUST BRIEFLY WALK THROUGH A

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:02.372 region:rollup2
OPTIONS FOR RAISING REVENUES

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:04.508 region:rollup2
FROM THE SALE RE PURPOSING OF

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:05.642 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPERTIES.

00:59:04.508 --> 00:59:07.811 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO SELLING

00:59:05.642 --> 00:59:09.379 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PARCELS OUR ENTIRE DC

00:59:07.811 --> 00:59:11.581 region:rollup2
PROPERTIES THERE ARE SOME

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:12.749 region:rollup2
BENEFITS TO THIS OPTION ONE IT

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:14.284 region:rollup2
WOULD REDUCE THE STATE'S

00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:15.786 region:rollup2
LIABILITY AT THESE PROPERTIES.

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:17.788 region:rollup2
COULD ALSO GENERATE A ONE TIME

00:59:15.786 --> 00:59:19.689 region:rollup2
INFLUX OF REVENUES THIS REVENUE

00:59:17.788 --> 00:59:21.958 region:rollup2
CAN ALSO BE INVESTED TO GENERATE

00:59:19.689 --> 00:59:22.526 region:rollup2
INTEREST WHICH WILL BE AN

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:23.860 region:rollup2
ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING.

00:59:22.526 --> 00:59:25.262 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:27.164 region:rollup2
AND ISSUES TO CONSIDER WITH THIS

00:59:25.262 --> 00:59:28.765 region:rollup2
OPTION HOWEVER AT EACH OF THE

00:59:27.164 --> 00:59:30.300 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPERTIES

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:31.835 region:rollup2
HAS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.403 region:rollup2
COULD AFFECT THE SALE POTENTIAL

00:59:31.835 --> 00:59:35.739 region:rollup2
IN MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY

00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:37.207 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE. THERE'S AGING

00:59:35.739 --> 00:59:39.109 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ITS NO MY.

00:59:37.207 --> 00:59:40.944 region:rollup2
THE PORTERVILLE LOCATION IS

00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:43.647 region:rollup2
FAIRLY REMOTE TO AN IS IN CLOSE

00:59:40.944 --> 00:59:45.048 region:rollup2
PROXIMITY TO THIS YEAR SECURE

00:59:43.647 --> 00:59:46.450 region:rollup2
TREATMENT PROGRAM.

00:59:45.048 --> 00:59:48.685 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ALSO LOCAL PREFERENCES

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:50.720 region:rollup2
TO CONSIDER OTHER LOCAL ZONING

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:53.490 region:rollup2
ORDINANCES AS WELL AS.

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:55.058 region:rollup2
BOTH AT FAIRVIEW AT SORRY IN

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:56.860 region:rollup2
THE CITY OF COSTA MESA AND THEN

00:59:55.058 --> 00:59:58.495 region:rollup2
ALSO. I WEAR CINEMA

00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.763 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER IS LOCATED

00:59:58.495 --> 01:00:01.331 region:rollup2
THERE VOTER APPROVAL

00:59:59.763 --> 01:00:02.833 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:04.501 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:05.902 region:rollup2
WE ALSO DON'T KNOW THE CURRENT

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:07.237 region:rollup2
VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES AND THEN

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:08.672 region:rollup2
FINALLY I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:10.340 region:rollup2
THE STATE IF IT WANTS TO

01:00:08.672 --> 01:00:12.209 region:rollup2
GENERATE REVENUES FROM THE SALE

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:14.444 region:rollup2
OF DC PROPERTY SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:15.846 region:rollup2
THE DTS SYSTEM. AND IT WANTS TO

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:18.115 region:rollup2
MAXIMIZE THE SALE POTENTIAL IT

01:00:15.846 --> 01:00:19.716 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE TO BYPASS THE TYPICAL

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:21.518 region:rollup2
STATE SURPLUS OF PROPERTY

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:23.053 region:rollup2
PROCESS THERE IS PRECEDENT FOR

01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:24.354 region:rollup2
DOING THIS IS JUST AN ISSUE TO

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:26.356 region:rollup2
TO KEEP IN MIND.

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:28.792 region:rollup2
ANOTHER OPTION OF WHEN IT COMES

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:30.060 region:rollup2
TO DC PROPERTIES IS TO LEASE

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.194 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PARCELS OF THE

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.762 region:rollup2
PROPERTY.

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:34.131 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS INCLUDE

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:36.166 region:rollup2
THIS COULD BE AN ONGOING SOURCE

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:37.434 region:rollup2
OF REVENUE I'D ALSO KEEPS THE

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:37.934 region:rollup2
PROPERTIES IN THE STATE'S HANDS

01:00:37.434 --> 01:00:39.402 region:rollup2
IF IT.

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:41.338 region:rollup2
IF IT NEEDS NEEDS THOSE

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:42.706 region:rollup2
PROPERTIES FOR PRETEND OF FUTURE

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:44.174 region:rollup2
STATE USE.

01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:46.243 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES

01:00:44.174 --> 01:00:47.611 region:rollup2
FOR ONE THE STATE IS NOT IN THE

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:49.112 region:rollup2
BUSINESS OF BEING A LANDLORD IT

01:00:47.611 --> 01:00:51.047 region:rollup2
DOES NOT TYPICALLY LEASED

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:52.249 region:rollup2
PROPERTIES AND ACT AS A LANDLORD

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:53.583 region:rollup2
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF RAISING

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:54.451 region:rollup2
REVENUES.

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:56.553 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THE UNIQUE

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:57.053 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH PROPERTY

01:00:56.553 --> 01:00:58.455 region:rollup2
COULD AFFECT THE LEASING

01:00:57.053 --> 01:01:01.191 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL.

01:00:58.455 --> 01:01:03.160 region:rollup2
AND I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT ONE

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:05.295 region:rollup2
ONE OPTION FOR LEASING HOWEVER

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:06.663 region:rollup2
WHICH IS TO LEAST. INDIVIDUAL

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:08.298 region:rollup2
PARCELS TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:09.633 region:rollup2
HOUSING THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR

01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:11.067 region:rollup2
DOING THIS AT THE FAIRVIEW

01:01:09.633 --> 01:01:12.135 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPERTY

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:13.503 region:rollup2
THERE'S CURRENTLY A HOUSING

01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:14.471 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AND ANOTHER ONE IN

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:15.805 region:rollup2
THE WORKS.

01:01:14.471 --> 01:01:17.974 region:rollup2
I THIS COULD INCREASE THE SUPPLY

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:19.776 region:rollup2
OF HOUSING FOR BOTH DS CONSUMERS

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:21.144 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS OTHER CALIFORNIANS.

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:23.146 region:rollup2
THE SURPLUS RENTAL PROCEEDS

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:25.715 region:rollup2
COULD BE USED TO SUBSIDIZE THE

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:27.951 region:rollup2
WRENCH OF DC A DDS CONSUMERS.

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:29.753 region:rollup2
.

01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:31.421 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THE THE

01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:33.089 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL CHALLENGES OF

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:35.392 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OPTION ON

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:36.092 region:rollup2
PAGE SEVEN. I'M AGAIN HAS TO DO

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:38.128 region:rollup2
WITH SOME OF THE UNIQUE

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:40.030 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH DC

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:41.164 region:rollup2
PROPERTIES SO FOR EXAMPLE WOULD

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.832 region:rollup2
VOTERS.

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.967 region:rollup2
IN COSTA MESA APPROVE A THIRD

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:45.335 region:rollup2
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:48.305 region:rollup2
THAT'S

01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:49.906 region:rollup2
UNKNOWN. EYES NOMO WE WOULD NOTE

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:51.241 region:rollup2
IS IN NOT CLOSE PER IS NOT IN

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:53.543 region:rollup2
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE OTHER

01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:54.544 region:rollup2
TYPES OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:56.680 region:rollup2
THAT DTS CONSUMERS WOULD NEED.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:58.848 region:rollup2
.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.016 region:rollup2
FINALLY ON PAGE EIGHT I WOULD

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:02.485 region:rollup2
JUST NOTE A COUPLE OTHER ISSUES

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:04.187 region:rollup2
FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION.

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:05.655 region:rollup2
I'M ONE WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:07.624 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE STATE BUDGET IS

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:09.359 region:rollup2
ALREADY WALKED IN AND EARMARKED

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:09.926 region:rollup2
FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES THIS WOULD

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:10.827 region:rollup2
BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF DOING

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:12.162 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:14.197 region:rollup2
OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:15.565 region:rollup2
DECIDE TO SUSPEND THAT

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:17.033 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT IF IT NEEDED THE

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.901 region:rollup2
FUNDS FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE.

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:19.102 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE ALSO NOT THE

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:21.938 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE ALWAYS HAS THE

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:23.640 region:rollup2
OPTION TO INCREASE SPENDING ON

01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:25.408 region:rollup2
DDS BUT SERVICES.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.676 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY WE WOULD JUST NOTE

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:28.178 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:32.182 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT HOW TO EFFECTIVELY

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:32.182 region:rollup2
TARGET THE SAVINGS SO FOR

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:36.152 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IT MAY WANT TO THINK

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:37.754 region:rollup2
ABOUT PARAMETERS FOR. THE

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:39.723 region:rollup2
SPECIAL FUNDS OF AND THAT IT

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:41.791 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKELY SET UP TO DEPOSIT

01:02:39.723 --> 01:02:42.959 region:rollup2
THE SAVINGS INTO. AND WE WOULD

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:44.561 region:rollup2
ALSO RECOMMEND.

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:47.030 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING A COMPREHENSIVE

01:02:44.561 --> 01:02:48.732 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT OF SERVICE GAPS IN

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:50.033 region:rollup2
THE DDS COMMUNITY SERVICES

01:02:48.732 --> 01:02:52.569 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:02:50.033 --> 01:02:54.237 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO CONCLUDE IF THE

01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:55.939 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO PURSUE

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:58.441 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL THERE DEFINITELY

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:59.743 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR. A GENERATING

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:01.177 region:rollup2
SAVINGS FROM THE CLOSURE OF

01:02:59.743 --> 01:03:01.611 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:03.446 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST A FEW

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:04.414 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THAT MIGHT

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:06.783 region:rollup2
WANT TO CONSIDER.

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:07.884 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.318 region:rollup2
UP NEXT WE'LL HAVE SOME GLIMMER

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:11.821 region:rollup2
MATHIS.

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:14.257 region:rollup2
BUT HER.

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:15.992 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE MEMBERS

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:06.382 region:rollup2
THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT HOLDING

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.250 region:rollup2
TOGETHER UNDER THE RATE

01:18:06.382 --> 01:18:09.685 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE TODAY. SO

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:11.387 region:rollup2
IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:12.922 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO PRIDE LEADERSHIP

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:14.423 region:rollup2
NOT DO THINGS THE WAY WE'VE

01:18:12.922 --> 01:18:15.824 region:rollup2
ALWAYS DONE IT BEFORE. ONE WE'VE

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:17.159 region:rollup2

01:55:09.002 --> 01:55:11.805 region:rollup2
THE RATES OF STAY THE SAME.

01:55:10.203 --> 01:55:13.206 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE PROGRAMS TO CLOSE

01:55:11.805 --> 01:55:14.674 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLE PRESSURES AND I JUST

01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:16.810 region:rollup2
WANT SPEAK REAL SPECIFICALLY TO

01:55:14.674 --> 01:55:18.412 region:rollup2
ONE ISSUE WHICH WAS BOTTOM

01:55:16.810 --> 01:55:19.780 region:rollup2
OUTLINED VERY WELL ON THE AGENDA

01:55:18.412 --> 01:55:20.881 region:rollup2
BUT JUST TO ADD TO IT.

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:22.482 region:rollup2
THAT THE DOUBLE WHAMMY THAT IS

01:55:20.881 --> 01:55:23.884 region:rollup2
HITTING PROVIDERS IN THE CERTAIN

IN THAT NOT ONLY ARE THERE COSTS

01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:30.123 region:rollup2

SOMEBODY IN BAKERSFIELD FOR SOME

01:55:35.729 --> 01:55:38.331 region:rollup2
AN ALLEY.

OF LIKE A THREE BEDROOM TWO BATH

01:57:12.626 --> 01:57:15.896 region:rollup2
HOUSE.

01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:17.264 region:rollup2
IT WAS CUTE AND FUNCTIONAL AND

01:57:15.896 --> 01:57:18.465 region:rollup2
NOW IT LOOKS MORE LIKE THE

01:57:17.264 --> 01:57:21.534 region:rollup2
WINCHESTER MYSTERY HOUSE AS

01:57:18.465 --> 01:57:23.470 region:rollup2

01:57:31.811 --> 01:57:37.484 region:rollup2
CRISIS TODAY AS MISTER CLAUS

01:57:37.484 --> 01:57:41.555 region:rollup2
A.

01:57:38.718 --> 01:57:43.256 region:rollup2
BY MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN BUT

01:57:41.555 --> 01:57:45.392 region:rollup2
TODAY WE'RE CONTINUING TO SEE

01:57:43.256 --> 01:57:46.893 region:rollup2
PROVIDER STRUGGLE PARTICULARLY

01:57:45.392 --> 01:57:49.095 region:rollup2
IN HIGH COST AREAS OF THE STATE.

01:57:46.893 --> 01:57:50.597 region:rollup2
AND SO WE APPRECIATE MISTER

01:57:49.095 --> 01:57:52.799 region:rollup2
HOLDEN'S REQUEST FOR THIS BRIDGE

01:57:50.597 --> 01:57:54.467 region:rollup2
FUNDING WHICH REALLY IS A BRIDGE

01:57:52.799 --> 01:57:57.337 region:rollup2
BETWEEN NOW AND THE RELEASE OF

01:57:54.467 --> 01:57:59.439 region:rollup2
THE RATE STUDY AND RATE REFORM.

01:57:57.337 --> 01:58:01.541 region:rollup2
INTO A SYSTEM THAT MAKES MORE

01:57:59.439 --> 01:58:02.976 region:rollup2
SENSE AND IS BASED AGAIN ON REAL

01:58:01.541 --> 01:58:04.544 region:rollup2
COSTS FOR THIS PROVISION OF

01:58:02.976 --> 01:58:06.246 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:08.348 region:rollup2
AS MR STEVENS AND MR KRAUSS

01:58:06.246 --> 01:58:09.683 region:rollup2
NOTED IT'S NOT ABOUT REGIONAL

01:58:08.348 --> 01:58:12.052 region:rollup2
CENTERS IT'S NOT ABOUT SERVICE

01:58:09.683 --> 01:58:14.020 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS IT'S ABOUT ENSURING.

01:58:12.052 --> 01:58:15.689 region:rollup2
THAT THE LETTERMAN ACT.

01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:17.591 region:rollup2
IS A REALITY FOR PEOPLE AND THE

01:58:15.689 --> 01:58:19.693 region:rollup2
WAY THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT

01:58:17.591 --> 01:58:21.127 region:rollup2
IS BY ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE

01:58:19.693 --> 01:58:22.662 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO

01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:25.365 region:rollup2
MEET THEIR NEEDS.

01:58:22.662 --> 01:58:27.267 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS A BUSINESS WHERE.

01:58:25.365 --> 01:58:28.868 region:rollup2
IT IS ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS IT

01:58:27.267 --> 01:58:30.537 region:rollup2
IS ALL ABOUT THAT PERFECT MATCH

01:58:28.868 --> 01:58:32.572 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL AND

01:58:30.537 --> 01:58:34.240 region:rollup2
THEIR SERVICE PROVIDER AND SO IS

01:58:32.572 --> 01:58:35.308 region:rollup2
SERVED SERVICE PROVIDERS

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:38.211 region:rollup2
BEGINNING TO.

01:58:35.308 --> 01:58:39.713 region:rollup2
DECLINING ADMISSIONS OR NEED TO

01:58:38.211 --> 01:58:41.548 region:rollup2
CUT BACK ON SERVICES OR CLOSE

01:58:39.713 --> 01:58:42.882 region:rollup2
THEIR DOORS. THAT CAUSES

01:58:41.548 --> 01:58:43.984 region:rollup2
DISRUPTION IN REAL PEOPLE'S

01:58:42.882 --> 01:58:46.653 region:rollup2
LIVES

01:58:43.984 --> 01:58:48.822 region:rollup2
AND THESE PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON

01:58:46.653 --> 01:58:50.724 region:rollup2
US TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PERFECT

01:58:48.822 --> 01:58:52.292 region:rollup2
MATCHES REMAIN AND THAT THEIR

01:58:50.724 --> 01:58:53.827 region:rollup2
SERVICES AREN'T SOMETHING THAT

01:58:52.292 --> 01:58:55.862 region:rollup2
WE JUST COBBLE TOGETHER. BUT

01:58:53.827 --> 01:58:57.230 region:rollup2

01:58:55.862 --> 01:58:57.664 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THEIR STATED GOALS AND

01:58:57.230 --> 01:58:59.432 region:rollup2

AND I THINK I'M A LOT OF A LOT

01:59:15.448 --> 01:59:18.651 region:rollup2
MY TESTIMONY ON OUR OUR FOUR

01:59:17.283 --> 01:59:19.719 region:rollup2
PERCENT RATE INCREASE IT COULD

01:59:18.651 --> 01:59:21.388 region:rollup2
BE STOLEN JUST FROM WHAT WE'VE

01:59:19.719 --> 01:59:22.722 region:rollup2
HEARD ON A ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:59:21.388 --> 01:59:24.391 region:rollup2
HOLDING I WANNA. JUST FIRST

01:59:22.722 --> 01:59:25.125 region:rollup2

TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR

01:59:27.627 --> 01:59:30.163 region:rollup2
BRIDGE FUNDING REQUEST FOR THOSE

01:59:29.062 --> 01:59:32.399 region:rollup2
HIGH COST AREAS.

01:59:30.163 --> 01:59:34.234 region:rollup2
BUT WE WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE

01:59:32.399 --> 01:59:36.302 region:rollup2
ARE IN A IN A REAL CRISIS AS A

01:59:34.234 --> 01:59:37.604 region:rollup2
AS A SYSTEM AS AS WE'VE HEARD.

01:59:36.302 --> 01:59:39.673 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WHAT CITIES IS

01:59:37.604 --> 01:59:41.207 region:rollup2
PROPOSING IS AND REQUESTING IS A

01:59:39.673 --> 01:59:42.509 region:rollup2
FOUR PERCENT INCREASE IN RATES

01:59:41.207 --> 01:59:43.910 region:rollup2
AGAIN UNTIL WE GET.

01:59:42.509 --> 01:59:44.577 region:rollup2
TO THE POINT WHERE THAT RATES

01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:45.412 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IS

01:59:44.577 --> 01:59:47.847 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

01:59:45.412 --> 01:59:48.915 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON IS THAT YOU KNOW

01:59:47.847 --> 01:59:50.183 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK HER WE GET

01:59:48.915 --> 01:59:51.718 region:rollup2
FOUR PERCENT WILL THAT TRACKS

01:59:50.183 --> 01:59:53.820 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE CPI INCREASE SINCE

01:59:51.718 --> 01:59:54.921 region:rollup2
WE GOT OUR LAST INCREASE WITH

01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:55.989 region:rollup2
THE VX TWO ONE FUNDING.

01:59:54.921 --> 01:59:56.956 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO GO BACK JUST A

01:59:55.989 --> 01:59:58.558 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ON THE HISTORY OF

01:59:56.956 --> 02:00:00.460 region:rollup2
RATE INCREASES PRIOR TO A. B. X.

01:59:58.558 --> 02:00:02.195 region:rollup2
TWO ONE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THE

02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:03.797 region:rollup2
SYSTEM HAD RECEIVED ANY INCREASE

02:00:02.195 --> 02:00:04.764 region:rollup2
AS A AS RATES SINCE TWO THOUSAND

02:00:03.797 --> 02:00:06.466 region:rollup2
SIX.

02:00:04.764 --> 02:00:08.401 region:rollup2
SO WE WERE LOOKING AT A TWENTY

02:00:06.466 --> 02:00:10.270 region:rollup2
PERCENT RAISE OUR INCREASE IN

02:00:08.401 --> 02:00:12.372 region:rollup2
CPI DURING TWO FROM TWO THOUSAND

02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:13.139 region:rollup2
SIX TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE

02:00:12.372 --> 02:00:14.040 region:rollup2
DID GET THE A B. X. TWO ONE

02:00:13.139 --> 02:00:15.675 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:16.943 region:rollup2
AND THE X. TWO ONE FUNDING WAS

02:00:15.675 --> 02:00:18.211 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IT AN ABSOLUTE

02:00:16.943 --> 02:00:19.813 region:rollup2
NECESSARY THING BUT

02:00:18.211 --> 02:00:20.847 region:rollup2
PREDOMINATELY IT WAS FOCUSED ON

02:00:19.813 --> 02:00:21.414 region:rollup2
A WAGE AND BENEFIT PASSED

02:00:20.847 --> 02:00:22.882 region:rollup2
THROUGH FOR DIRECT SERVICE

02:00:21.414 --> 02:00:23.983 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS. I THINK ALL THE

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:25.685 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS IN THE ROOM WOULD

02:00:23.983 --> 02:00:26.619 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TELL YOU THAT'S THAT'S

02:00:25.685 --> 02:00:28.455 region:rollup2
REALLY WHERE A LOT OF THE MONEY

02:00:26.619 --> 02:00:30.724 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO GO BUT IT DID LEAVE A

02:00:28.455 --> 02:00:32.225 region:rollup2
LOT OF GAPS UNADDRESSED A A LOT

02:00:30.724 --> 02:00:33.593 region:rollup2
OF COSTA PROVIDERS JUST TO RUN

02:00:32.225 --> 02:00:35.729 region:rollup2
THE SERVICE DID NOT GET.

02:00:33.593 --> 02:00:36.696 region:rollup2
ACCURATE ARE YOU KNOW

02:00:35.729 --> 02:00:38.865 region:rollup2
COMMENSURATE INCREASES TO KEEP

02:00:36.696 --> 02:00:39.165 region:rollup2
THEM KEEP THE BUSINESSES FUND

02:00:38.865 --> 02:00:40.433 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONAL.

02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:42.068 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE WE'RE

02:00:40.433 --> 02:00:44.871 region:rollup2
SEEING PROVIDERS.

02:00:42.068 --> 02:00:46.072 region:rollup2
WHO WHO CANNOT DELIVER SERVICES

02:00:44.871 --> 02:00:47.307 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WANT TO DELIVER IN

02:00:46.072 --> 02:00:48.608 region:rollup2
THERE DEVELOPING INTERNAL

02:00:47.307 --> 02:00:49.676 region:rollup2
WEIGHTLESS REGARDING HEARD SOME

02:00:48.608 --> 02:00:51.544 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY ABOUT THAT?

02:00:49.676 --> 02:00:53.980 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE REALLY AT A POINT

02:00:51.544 --> 02:00:56.082 region:rollup2
WHERE WE DO NEED SOME SORT OF

02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:57.016 region:rollup2
TEMPORARY STABILIZATION UNTIL WE

02:00:56.082 --> 02:00:58.017 region:rollup2
CAN GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE

02:00:57.016 --> 02:00:58.785 region:rollup2
WITH THE RATE STUDY. THAT'S

02:00:58.017 --> 02:00:59.986 region:rollup2
REALLY WHAT THE FOUR PERCENT

02:00:58.785 --> 02:01:01.254 region:rollup2
ABOUT IN THE OTHER THE OTHER

02:00:59.986 --> 02:01:02.055 region:rollup2
PIECE OF THE REQUEST IS REALLY

02:01:01.254 --> 02:01:04.357 region:rollup2
TO ELIMINATE THOSE MEDIAN RATE

02:01:02.055 --> 02:01:06.693 region:rollup2
CAPS WHICH WAS SUPPRESSING A

02:01:04.357 --> 02:01:07.761 region:rollup2
SERVICES KEEPING NEW PROVIDERS

02:01:06.693 --> 02:01:09.262 region:rollup2
OUT OF A SERVICES.

02:01:07.761 --> 02:01:10.430 region:rollup2
THAT THAT DON'T ALLOW REGIONAL

02:01:09.262 --> 02:01:12.365 region:rollup2
CENTERS TO NEGOTIATE WITH

02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:12.966 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS TO INCREASE RATES SO

02:01:12.365 --> 02:01:15.468 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY THEY HAVE TO CLOSE

02:01:12.966 --> 02:01:16.803 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS. AND I I THINK WE HEARD

02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:17.437 region:rollup2
MISTER STEVENS VETOED AND WE

02:01:16.803 --> 02:01:18.471 region:rollup2
SPOKE A LITTLE BIT AS WELL AT

02:01:17.437 --> 02:01:20.673 region:rollup2
THAT MEETING RATE CAPS ARE

02:01:18.471 --> 02:01:21.941 region:rollup2
REALLY KILLERS ON KEEPING

02:01:20.673 --> 02:01:23.810 region:rollup2
SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE

02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:25.745 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS WHO RELY ON THEM.

02:01:23.810 --> 02:01:27.580 region:rollup2
WE DID AT AN INFORMAL INTERNAL

02:01:25.745 --> 02:01:29.749 region:rollup2
SURVEY WITH CDSA MEMBERS WE HAVE

02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:31.251 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY OVER EIGHTY MEMBERS OF

02:01:29.749 --> 02:01:32.585 region:rollup2
THE CDSA TWENTY THREE OF OUR

02:01:31.251 --> 02:01:34.187 region:rollup2
MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS RESPONDED

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:35.388 region:rollup2
TO THE SURVEY. AS ONE TO GIVE

02:01:34.187 --> 02:01:36.823 region:rollup2
YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN IDEA IT'S

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:38.057 region:rollup2
IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT ASSEMBLY

02:01:36.823 --> 02:01:39.592 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE BUT IT GIVES YOU

02:01:38.057 --> 02:01:40.627 region:rollup2
A FLAVOR OF WHAT WHAT WE'RE

02:01:39.592 --> 02:01:41.961 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH.

02:01:40.627 --> 02:01:44.130 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THOSE TWENTY THREE

02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:44.664 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS OPERATE HUNDRED

02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:45.765 region:rollup2
AND SEVENTY NINE PROGRAMS

02:01:44.664 --> 02:01:47.934 region:rollup2
FORTY TWO OF THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE

02:01:45.765 --> 02:01:49.369 region:rollup2
WAIT LISTS TODAY. WE ARE WE HAVE

02:01:47.934 --> 02:01:50.670 region:rollup2
THE LANHAM ACT WILL NOT POST

02:01:49.369 --> 02:01:52.338 region:rollup2
THAT WE LISTEN CALIFORNIA BUT IN

02:01:50.670 --> 02:01:53.973 region:rollup2
REALITY WE DO BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:01:52.338 --> 02:01:55.308 region:rollup2
SERVICES THE PEOPLE WANT. THAT

02:01:53.973 --> 02:01:56.543 region:rollup2
WE JUST CANNOT PROVIDE BECAUSE

02:01:55.308 --> 02:01:57.777 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING

02:01:56.543 --> 02:01:59.479 region:rollup2
DUE TO THE LOW RATES.

02:01:57.777 --> 02:02:01.047 region:rollup2
AUTHOR OVER A THIRD OF THOSE

02:01:59.479 --> 02:02:02.148 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS HAVE REDUCE CLIENTS IN

02:02:01.047 --> 02:02:03.516 region:rollup2
THE LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE

02:02:02.148 --> 02:02:04.584 region:rollup2
STAFF SHORTAGE SO THEY'VE

02:02:03.516 --> 02:02:05.919 region:rollup2
REDUCED THE NUMBER SERVICES

02:02:04.584 --> 02:02:06.753 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE. FOR THOSE

02:02:05.919 --> 02:02:08.988 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CLOSE

02:02:06.753 --> 02:02:10.256 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ENTIRELY DUE TO STAFF

02:02:08.988 --> 02:02:11.090 region:rollup2
SHORTAGE OR RATE INADEQUACY SO

02:02:10.256 --> 02:02:12.825 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT SOME

02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:14.194 region:rollup2
VERIFIABLE PROBLEMS I THINK PART

02:02:12.825 --> 02:02:15.728 region:rollup2
OF THE PROBLEM WE DON'T HAVE A

02:02:14.194 --> 02:02:17.497 region:rollup2
REALLY GOOD DATA SYSTEM.

02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:18.665 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF PROGRAM CLOSE AND

02:02:17.497 --> 02:02:20.133 region:rollup2
OVER THERE THAT ARC HAS DONE A

02:02:18.665 --> 02:02:22.001 region:rollup2
SURVEY THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO

02:02:20.133 --> 02:02:23.736 region:rollup2
DETERMINE HOW MANY PROGRAMS HAVE

02:02:22.001 --> 02:02:25.171 region:rollup2
CLOSE BUT I DO THINK IF IF YOU

02:02:23.736 --> 02:02:28.274 region:rollup2
REALLY TOOK A GOOD SNAPSHOT OF

02:02:25.171 --> 02:02:28.842 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY YOU WILL SEE A

02:02:28.274 --> 02:02:29.342 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IN CRISIS AT THIS

02:02:28.842 --> 02:02:29.609 region:rollup2
POINT.

02:02:29.342 --> 02:02:31.311 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN.

02:02:29.609 --> 02:02:32.378 region:rollup2
.

02:02:31.311 --> 02:02:34.047 region:rollup2
WE YOU KNOW WE ARE AT A POINT

02:02:32.378 --> 02:02:35.748 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE LOOKING FOR

02:02:34.047 --> 02:02:37.083 region:rollup2
SOMETHING NOT NOT FOREVER BUT

02:02:35.748 --> 02:02:38.885 region:rollup2
THEIR POINT WHERE WE CAN JUST

02:02:37.083 --> 02:02:40.253 region:rollup2
KEEP OURSELVES AFLOAT. UNTIL THE

02:02:38.885 --> 02:02:42.188 region:rollup2
NEW RATES COME IN THROUGH THE

02:02:40.253 --> 02:02:43.523 region:rollup2
RATE STUDY WE THINK THE SAVINGS

02:02:42.188 --> 02:02:44.657 region:rollup2
FROM THE CLOSING THE DC THE MOST

02:02:43.523 --> 02:02:46.960 region:rollup2
PERFECT OUTLINED IN THE LA OVER

02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:47.160 region:rollup2
PORT COULD HELP BACKFILL SOME OF

02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:48.528 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:50.196 region:rollup2
WE KNOW IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ASK

02:02:48.528 --> 02:02:50.830 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO THINK IT'S AN

02:02:50.196 --> 02:02:52.265 region:rollup2
UPSWING NECESSARY ACTS

02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:53.900 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN DELIVER ON THE

02:02:52.265 --> 02:02:55.768 region:rollup2
PROMISE OF THAT LIMON ACT. SO WE

02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:57.604 region:rollup2
DON'T LEAVE PEOPLE SITTING AT

02:02:55.768 --> 02:02:59.072 region:rollup2
HOME WITHOUT SERVICES NOT

02:02:57.604 --> 02:02:59.973 region:rollup2
GETTING YOU KNOW NOT LIVING

02:02:59.072 --> 02:03:01.641 region:rollup2
FULFILLING LIVES THAT'S THAT'S

02:02:59.973 --> 02:03:02.742 region:rollup2
NOT WHO WE ARE AS CALIFORNIA

02:03:01.641 --> 02:03:04.611 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SHOULD ASPIRE

02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:07.347 region:rollup2
TO BE. AND WE WOULD LIKE YOUR

02:03:04.611 --> 02:03:08.781 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IN MAKING SURE THAT

02:03:07.347 --> 02:03:10.183 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WHO WE. THINK IS.

02:03:08.781 --> 02:03:11.584 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:03:10.183 --> 02:03:13.953 region:rollup2
SPEAK ABOUT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

02:03:11.584 --> 02:03:16.222 region:rollup2
ISSUE ARM AND FOR YOUR ONGOING

02:03:13.953 --> 02:03:17.690 region:rollup2
INTEREST AND COMMITMENT TO THE

02:03:16.222 --> 02:03:19.158 region:rollup2
ISSUES FACED IN THE SYSTEM BOTH

02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:20.994 region:rollup2
MISTER HOLDEN AND ALL OF THE

02:03:19.158 --> 02:03:23.062 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE.

02:03:20.994 --> 02:03:25.265 region:rollup2
I WANNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:03:23.062 --> 02:03:27.433 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN VERY

02:03:25.265 --> 02:03:29.869 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS OR WHO ARE

02:03:27.433 --> 02:03:31.437 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO GO TO THOSE SETTINGS

02:03:29.869 --> 02:03:32.672 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS

02:03:31.437 --> 02:03:34.474 region:rollup2
WHO ARE MOST LIKE THE

02:03:32.672 --> 02:03:35.508 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO PREVIOUSLY LIVED

02:03:34.474 --> 02:03:37.777 region:rollup2
IN STATE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS

02:03:35.508 --> 02:03:39.712 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE. VERY INTENSIVE

02:03:37.777 --> 02:03:41.714 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES.

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:43.850 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND AND

02:03:41.714 --> 02:03:46.286 region:rollup2
EIGHT WE IMPOSED A MEDIAN RATE

02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:48.621 region:rollup2
FREEZE IT IS INCREASINGLY

02:03:46.286 --> 02:03:50.390 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO

02:03:48.621 --> 02:03:52.125 region:rollup2
MOVE FROM THESE VERY RESTRICTIVE

02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:53.826 region:rollup2
SETTINGS OR IF THEY NEED A

02:03:52.125 --> 02:03:55.028 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KIND OF PLACEMENT

02:03:53.826 --> 02:03:56.429 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF A BEHAVIORAL

02:03:55.028 --> 02:03:59.032 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE THEY'RE EXPERIENCING.

02:03:56.429 --> 02:04:00.633 region:rollup2
TO FIND AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR

02:03:59.032 --> 02:04:03.269 region:rollup2
THEM AND SO WHAT WE'RE

02:04:00.633 --> 02:04:05.772 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING IS BOTH WISE IN TERMS

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:08.441 region:rollup2
OF POLICY AND FISCALLY SOUND.

02:04:05.772 --> 02:04:09.876 region:rollup2
AND BAD IS THAT FOR INDIVIDUALS

02:04:08.441 --> 02:04:12.412 region:rollup2
IN THESE VERY RESTRICTIVE

02:04:09.876 --> 02:04:14.080 region:rollup2
SETTINGS MOON MANY OF WHICH ARE

02:04:12.412 --> 02:04:15.848 region:rollup2
CALLED INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL

02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:17.550 region:rollup2
DISEASE THEIR LARGE WALK SKILLED

02:04:15.848 --> 02:04:19.218 region:rollup2
NURSING FACILITIES THIRDS TO

02:04:17.550 --> 02:04:21.120 region:rollup2
THAT SERVE INDIVIDUALS ON IN

02:04:19.218 --> 02:04:24.324 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE.

02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:24.824 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE FACILITIES DON'T

02:04:24.324 --> 02:04:26.759 region:rollup2
GET ANY FEDERAL DOLLARS

02:04:24.824 --> 02:04:28.394 region:rollup2
IT'S A REQUIREMENT BY FEDERAL

02:04:26.759 --> 02:04:30.963 region:rollup2
LAW THAT IF YOU LIVE IN AND AM I

02:04:28.394 --> 02:04:31.831 region:rollup2
AM DE THAT YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE

02:04:30.963 --> 02:04:33.800 region:rollup2
FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:36.135 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION SO WE ARE PAYING

02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:38.771 region:rollup2
SLOW SOLELY WITH. STATE GENERAL

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:41.040 region:rollup2
FUND MONEY OF THE COST OF THAT

02:04:38.771 --> 02:04:43.509 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS CARE WHICH IS VERY

02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:45.311 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL.

02:04:43.509 --> 02:04:48.114 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

02:04:45.311 --> 02:04:49.849 region:rollup2
BUT EFFECTIVE MECHANISM TO HELP

02:04:48.114 --> 02:04:51.117 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LEAVE THOSE SETTINGS OR

02:04:49.849 --> 02:04:53.152 region:rollup2
PREVENT THEIR

02:04:51.117 --> 02:04:55.321 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONALIZATION THEIR AND

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:57.156 region:rollup2
OUR SOLUTIONS ARE. FIRST THAT WE

02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:58.758 region:rollup2
RESTORE TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS

02:04:57.156 --> 02:05:01.394 region:rollup2
FOR THE SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE

02:04:58.758 --> 02:05:03.162 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE RATES

02:05:01.394 --> 02:05:04.497 region:rollup2
BETTER BE ON THE MEDIAN RATE

02:05:03.162 --> 02:05:07.400 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS IN

02:05:04.497 --> 02:05:08.334 region:rollup2
CRISIS AND NEED A PLACE TO GO.

02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:10.737 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE CRISIS IS

02:05:08.334 --> 02:05:13.573 region:rollup2
RESOLVED A PLACE TO MOVE INTO.

02:05:10.737 --> 02:05:15.241 region:rollup2
AND SECOND THAT WE FIX THE FROM

02:05:13.573 --> 02:05:17.710 region:rollup2
OUR PERSPECTIVE BROKEN HEALTH

02:05:15.241 --> 02:05:20.446 region:rollup2
AND SAFETY WAIVER PROCESS WHICH

02:05:17.710 --> 02:05:21.914 region:rollup2
IS A VERY LONG PROCESS AND II

02:05:20.446 --> 02:05:22.648 region:rollup2
DON'T SAY THAT TO BE CRITICAL OF

02:05:21.914 --> 02:05:24.283 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT I THINK THEY'RE

02:05:22.648 --> 02:05:26.486 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SERVE TRYING TO WORK

02:05:24.283 --> 02:05:28.755 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE. BILL BACKLOG OF

02:05:26.486 --> 02:05:32.859 region:rollup2
REQUESTS FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY

02:05:28.755 --> 02:05:34.961 region:rollup2
WAIVERS FOR YOU AS BEST THEY CAN

02:05:32.859 --> 02:05:35.695 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IT

02:05:34.961 --> 02:05:36.329 region:rollup2
TAKES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX

02:05:35.695 --> 02:05:38.131 region:rollup2
DAYS ON AVERAGE WHEN YOU TALK

02:05:36.329 --> 02:05:39.599 region:rollup2
ABOUT PENDING AS WELL AS THE NEW

02:05:38.131 --> 02:05:41.134 region:rollup2
REQUEST THAT ARE COMING IN. TO

02:05:39.599 --> 02:05:43.436 region:rollup2
PROCESS A HEALTH AND SAFETY

02:05:41.134 --> 02:05:44.470 region:rollup2
WAIVER. IF YOU'RE IN CRISIS AND

02:05:43.436 --> 02:05:46.539 region:rollup2
YOU NEED A PLACE TO GO THAT'S

02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:48.508 region:rollup2
THAT'S A BIT TOO LONG TO WAIT

02:05:46.539 --> 02:05:50.777 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE

02:05:48.508 --> 02:05:51.677 region:rollup2
SERVICES YOU NEED. SO.

02:05:50.777 --> 02:05:52.979 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL FOR INDIVIDUALS

SOME OF THOSE AREAS MANY OF THE

02:08:28.301 --> 02:08:31.737 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES. DIFFICULT DECISIONS

WERE MADE ONE OF THE AREAS WAS A

02:08:31.737 --> 02:08:35.041 region:rollup2
RATE FREEZE.

02:08:32.872 --> 02:08:36.409 region:rollup2
AS PART OF THAT PROCESS TO TAKE

02:08:35.041 --> 02:08:38.211 region:rollup2
A LOOK AT WITH THE.

02:08:36.409 --> 02:08:40.513 region:rollup2
RATE FREEZE COULD ABOUT

02:08:38.211 --> 02:08:41.647 region:rollup2
COINCIDING LOOK AT HOW TO IS

02:08:40.513 --> 02:08:44.283 region:rollup2

WORK THROUGH THEM. THE WORKGROUP

02:09:24.957 --> 02:09:28.127 region:rollup2
WAS VERY HELPFUL IN IDENTIFYING

02:09:26.492 --> 02:09:29.495 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT WE CAN START

02:09:28.127 --> 02:09:30.096 region:rollup2

IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE

02:23:22.294 --> 02:23:26.398 region:rollup2
BEEN RATE INCREASES THAT HELPED

02:23:24.062 --> 02:23:28.400 region:rollup2
A STABILIZER AT THE LABOR FORCE.

02:23:26.398 --> 02:23:30.135 region:rollup2
I THINK THE INTERMOUNTAIN BEING

02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:31.636 region:rollup2
REQUESTED ON THE FOUR PERCENT IS

02:23:30.135 --> 02:23:33.271 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON THERE'S NO

02:23:31.636 --> 02:23:35.040 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT MANY PLACES THERE

02:23:33.271 --> 02:23:36.842 region:rollup2
WAITING LISTS BECAUSE PEOPLE

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:38.210 region:rollup2
WILL NOT APPLY FOR THE JOB.

02:23:36.842 --> 02:23:40.078 region:rollup2
SO CLEARLY IS AN ENTITLEMENT

02:23:38.210 --> 02:23:41.680 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WE ARE HAVING A RUBBER

02:23:40.078 --> 02:23:43.715 region:rollup2
MEETS THE ROAD ON THE FRONT

02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:45.117 region:rollup2
LINES IF WE CAN'T GET PEOPLE WHO

02:23:43.715 --> 02:23:47.085 region:rollup2
WILL COME AND APPLY FOR THE JOB

02:23:45.117 --> 02:23:48.520 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T. A START IN A

02:23:47.085 --> 02:23:49.888 region:rollup2
REASONABLE TIME SOMEBODY WHO

02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:50.922 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO SERVICE.

02:23:49.888 --> 02:23:53.058 region:rollup2
UP CLEARLY.

02:23:50.922 --> 02:23:54.993 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR ME TO HAVE

02:23:53.058 --> 02:23:57.362 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN THERE. AND

02:23:54.993 --> 02:23:59.397 region:rollup2
THEN I AM OUR FACILITY.

02:23:57.362 --> 02:24:01.700 region:rollup2
HEART WRENCHING STORIES SO ALL I

02:23:59.397 --> 02:24:02.334 region:rollup2

NATIVE HOOSIER HERE A.

02:24:22.387 --> 02:24:26.024 region:rollup2
IS THE COMPASSION SHOWN FOR THE

02:24:24.156 --> 02:24:27.759 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE. AND THAT'S

02:24:26.024 --> 02:24:29.861 region:rollup2
EVIDENCED IN THE NEWS.

AUDIT FOR EXAMPLE.

02:24:51.683 --> 02:24:54.553 region:rollup2
THESE THE KIND OF COSTS THAT WE

02:24:53.184 --> 02:24:56.421 region:rollup2
DIDN'T GET COVERED IN THE WAGE

02:24:54.553 --> 02:24:57.889 region:rollup2

02:24:56.421 --> 02:25:00.025 region:rollup2
MY STAFF DID APPRECIATE.

02:24:57.889 --> 02:25:01.726 region:rollup2

HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF BRIDGE

02:28:59.731 --> 02:29:03.434 region:rollup2
RATE INCREASE IN BETWEEN NOW AND

02:29:01.499 --> 02:29:04.035 region:rollup2
WHEN THE STREET STUDY COMES OUT.

02:29:03.434 --> 02:29:05.870 region:rollup2
ARE WITH THE RATES DAY'S GONNA

02:29:04.035 --> 02:29:07.472 region:rollup2
SAY. BUT IF IT'S HONEST

02:29:05.870 --> 02:29:08.473 region:rollup2
INTELLECTUALLY IT'S GOING TO SAY

02:29:07.472 --> 02:29:09.240 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE NOT PAYING ENOUGH FOR

02:29:08.473 --> 02:29:10.909 region:rollup2
THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE TRYING

02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:12.210 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE. OR IT'S GOING TO SAY

02:29:10.909 --> 02:29:13.912 region:rollup2
MAYBE WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING

02:29:12.210 --> 02:29:15.747 region:rollup2
CERTAIN THINGS ANYMORE AND

02:29:13.912 --> 02:29:16.414 region:rollup2
THEREFORE ONLY PAY FOR THESE

02:29:15.747 --> 02:29:18.817 region:rollup2
THINGS AND THIS IS HOW MUCH THE

02:29:16.414 --> 02:29:20.452 region:rollup2
COST. WHO KNOWS BUT UNTIL THEN

02:29:18.817 --> 02:29:22.086 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU

02:29:20.452 --> 02:29:22.887 region:rollup2
OF OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:29:22.086 --> 02:29:23.922 region:rollup2
PEOPLE STATEWIDE?

02:29:22.887 --> 02:29:25.590 region:rollup2
MANY OF WHOM BY THE WAY AREN'T

02:29:23.922 --> 02:29:26.558 region:rollup2
EVEN ASKING FOR SERVICES WE

02:29:25.590 --> 02:29:29.160 region:rollup2
DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THE

02:29:26.558 --> 02:29:30.595 region:rollup2
SAVINGS. IN THIS SYSTEM FROM THE

02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:32.096 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY

02:29:30.595 --> 02:29:33.131 region:rollup2
DON'T GET SERVICES.

02:29:32.096 --> 02:29:34.532 region:rollup2
SO EVERYBODY ELSE THAT IS

02:29:33.131 --> 02:29:35.733 region:rollup2
GETTING SERVICES

02:29:34.532 --> 02:29:37.769 region:rollup2
IS AFTER STRUGGLING TO FIND

02:29:35.733 --> 02:29:39.637 region:rollup2
ANYTHING. OF SOME KIND OF

02:29:37.769 --> 02:29:40.471 region:rollup2
QUALITY.

02:29:39.637 --> 02:29:42.674 region:rollup2
GETTING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT

02:29:40.471 --> 02:29:44.142 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY THE RATES DON'T MATCH

02:29:42.674 --> 02:29:46.311 region:rollup2
UP TO THAT THE STAFF THAT WERE

02:29:44.142 --> 02:29:47.412 region:rollup2
PEEING OUR LOWER LOWER PAID

02:29:46.311 --> 02:29:50.315 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO THE COST LIVING

02:29:47.412 --> 02:29:50.315 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

02:29:50.381 --> 02:29:53.485 region:rollup2
THAT COST OF LIVING GOES UP

02:29:52.050 --> 02:29:55.787 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE YEAR. IN WITH IT

02:29:53.485 --> 02:29:56.387 region:rollup2
ANY CHART IN AMERICA IT'LL SHOW

02:29:55.787 --> 02:29:58.389 region:rollup2
COLA THE COST OF LIVING GOING

02:29:56.387 --> 02:30:00.291 region:rollup2
UP.

02:29:58.389 --> 02:30:01.426 region:rollup2
AND THE RATES HERE ARE FROZEN

02:30:00.291 --> 02:30:02.627 region:rollup2
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

02:30:01.426 --> 02:30:03.761 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT THE

02:30:02.627 --> 02:30:05.063 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS THAT ARE ON THE ROPES

02:30:03.761 --> 02:30:07.532 region:rollup2

GET. OUT OF THE SERVICE MODEL

02:30:27.051 --> 02:30:30.054 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN'T PROVIDE THE

02:30:28.253 --> 02:30:32.190 region:rollup2
SERVICES ANYMORE.

02:30:30.054 --> 02:30:33.625 region:rollup2
I ALSO JUST WHAT IT'S WORSE THAN

02:30:33.625 --> 02:30:36.661 region:rollup2

FROM A MOUTH IS BUT BEING

02:30:37.795 --> 02:30:42.634 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM. IN THAT

02:30:39.664 --> 02:30:44.736 region:rollup2
MANNER WE JUST SAP TO A BUDGET

02:30:42.634 --> 02:30:46.204 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION BUYER CFO RECENTLY

02:30:44.736 --> 02:30:48.139 region:rollup2

YEAR OVER YEAR OF LAST YEAR TO

02:30:48.139 --> 02:30:50.942 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR. I WAS STUNNED BECAUSE

02:30:49.941 --> 02:30:52.944 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN SITTING ON THIS POOR

02:30:50.942 --> 02:30:54.445 region:rollup2
FOR NUMBER YEARS. BUT TO WATCH

02:30:52.944 --> 02:30:55.947 region:rollup2
THE FLIP THE NUMBER OF

02:30:54.445 --> 02:30:58.049 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES OF SERVICES THAT WE

02:30:55.947 --> 02:30:59.317 region:rollup2
GET RATES FOR. THAT SUDDENLY YOU

02:30:58.049 --> 02:31:00.785 region:rollup2

PROGRAM TYPE THAT WE PROVIDE. IS

02:31:03.288 --> 02:31:05.790 region:rollup2

THE RATES NOW.

02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:08.359 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COUPLE OF AREAS THAT

02:31:07.125 --> 02:31:09.360 region:rollup2
ARE FLOATING ARREST ANYONE TO

02:31:08.359 --> 02:31:10.762 region:rollup2

02:31:10.762 --> 02:31:14.766 region:rollup2
WE'RE BEING OVERPAID THOSE AREAS

02:31:12.564 --> 02:31:15.333 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S LITERALLY. WHAT'S

02:31:14.766 --> 02:31:16.234 region:rollup2
HOLDING THE SYSTEM TOGETHER

02:31:15.333 --> 02:31:17.435 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW

02:31:16.234 --> 02:31:19.003 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS AN AGENCY THAT'S

02:31:17.435 --> 02:31:20.872 region:rollup2
BEEN AROUND FOR SIXTY YEARS LONG

02:31:19.003 --> 02:31:22.373 region:rollup2

02:31:47.165 --> 02:31:49.467 region:rollup2
NOW. THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT IN

02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:50.868 region:rollup2

THIRTY DAYS. A SIDE EFFECT OF

THOSE DAYS.

02:39:36.934 --> 02:39:40.404 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A PENALTY AYE ITS

02:39:37.868 --> 02:39:42.273 region:rollup2

LA ZEROES IN MOST OF THE YEARS.

02:39:47.678 --> 02:39:51.515 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE SAME TIME ALL I

02:39:49.580 --> 02:39:52.049 region:rollup2
HAVE TO COMPARE IS IS THE BAY

02:39:51.515 --> 02:39:53.184 region:rollup2
AREA.

02:39:52.049 --> 02:39:54.885 region:rollup2
THE BAY AREA.

02:39:53.184 --> 02:39:56.454 region:rollup2
CP I.

02:39:54.885 --> 02:39:57.988 region:rollup2

PERCENT.

02:40:02.893 --> 02:40:05.696 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN WE GOT OUR SEVEN

02:40:04.028 --> 02:40:06.163 region:rollup2
PERCENT BUT THAT WAS PASSED TO

02:40:05.696 --> 02:40:08.132 region:rollup2

IT NEEDS TO BE OUT THERE

02:40:16.474 --> 02:40:21.445 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY AND LOOK AT THAT AS

02:40:18.676 --> 02:40:22.913 region:rollup2
A DOWN PAYMENT BECAUSE.

02:40:21.445 --> 02:40:24.582 region:rollup2

02:50:13.837 --> 02:50:17.107 region:rollup2
WERE NOT THE MODEL WHEN IT COMES

02:50:15.439 --> 02:50:18.842 region:rollup2
TO THE FINANCE PART OF IT.

02:50:17.107 --> 02:50:19.710 region:rollup2
SO NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A

02:50:18.842 --> 02:50:21.511 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE IN

02:50:19.710 --> 02:50:24.147 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:50:21.511 --> 02:50:25.716 region:rollup2
BUT THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.

02:50:24.147 --> 02:50:28.385 region:rollup2
AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS

02:50:25.716 --> 02:50:30.620 region:rollup2
LOOKING UPON OUR LEADERSHIP. TO

02:50:28.385 --> 02:50:32.989 region:rollup2
FIGURE THIS OUT.

02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:34.424 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN WE FIGURE THE SAL.

02:50:32.989 --> 02:50:36.026 region:rollup2
OTHER PEOPLE WILL FIGURE OUT

02:50:34.424 --> 02:50:37.527 region:rollup2
TILL AND IF WE CAN'T FIGURE IT

02:50:36.026 --> 02:50:39.096 region:rollup2
OUT.

02:50:37.527 --> 02:50:41.064 region:rollup2
THEN IT'S MOST LIKELY THEY'RE

02:50:39.096 --> 02:50:42.332 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT.

02:50:41.064 --> 02:50:44.634 region:rollup2
A FEW DAYS AGO I TALKED TO

WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

02:50:52.542 --> 02:50:55.078 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE

02:50:54.277 --> 02:50:56.513 region:rollup2

THE WORLD.

02:50:59.549 --> 02:51:03.386 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN WE FIGURE THIS OUT.

02:51:01.318 --> 02:51:03.954 region:rollup2

FOUR MILLION.

02:54:19.015 --> 02:54:21.084 region:rollup2

WITH MY SON.

02:54:29.426 --> 02:54:33.863 region:rollup2
WHERE WE LOST THE PROVIDER?

AND THAT PROVIDER GOT SHUT DOWN

02:54:35.165 --> 02:54:39.102 region:rollup2

02:54:37.367 --> 02:54:41.204 region:rollup2
IT WE WE GET INTO THIS PROVIDER

02:54:39.102 --> 02:54:42.906 region:rollup2
CLIENT CONVERSATION WHEN WE'RE

BOUGHT IT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:54:44.674 --> 02:54:47.711 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING TRYING

02:54:45.642 --> 02:54:50.246 region:rollup2
TO GET BY AND PROVIDE FOR THEIR

02:54:47.711 --> 02:54:51.948 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WHO WAS REFERRED TODAY

02:54:50.246 --> 02:54:53.450 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE LOVE

02:54:51.948 --> 02:54:55.318 region:rollup2
TO BE GAS STATION ATTENDANTS.

02:54:53.450 --> 02:54:58.221 region:rollup2
SOME OF LEFT FROM GAS STATION

02:54:55.318 --> 02:54:59.255 region:rollup2
ATTENDANTS COME HERE. BUT.

02:54:58.221 --> 02:55:00.757 region:rollup2
WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE THAT

02:54:59.255 --> 02:55:03.093 region:rollup2
PICKED A PROFESSION

02:55:00.757 --> 02:55:03.994 region:rollup2
SERVE IN AND TO HELP.

02:55:03.093 --> 02:55:07.097 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

02:55:03.994 --> 02:55:09.532 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES.

02:55:07.097 --> 02:55:11.835 region:rollup2
WHO'VE MADE IT THEIR LIFE.

02:55:09.532 --> 02:55:13.570 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME THAT.

02:55:11.835 --> 02:55:15.038 region:rollup2
BUT AS A DAD.

02:55:13.570 --> 02:55:17.874 region:rollup2
WITH THE SUN THAT THAT'S BEEN

02:55:15.038 --> 02:55:20.710 region:rollup2
DOWN THIS ROAD.

02:55:17.874 --> 02:55:23.346 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS

02:55:20.710 --> 02:55:25.415 region:rollup2
WHO ARE EXTREMELY. DEPENDENT ON

02:55:23.346 --> 02:55:26.816 region:rollup2
THE SERVICES.

02:55:25.415 --> 02:55:28.618 region:rollup2
I SURELY THINK FOR THEM THAT MY

02:55:26.816 --> 02:55:31.021 region:rollup2
SON DID WELL IN IN THESE

02:55:28.618 --> 02:55:32.122 region:rollup2
MAINSTREAM AT SCHOOL NOW.

02:55:31.021 --> 02:55:34.357 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT HE MAY NOT HAVE

02:55:32.122 --> 02:55:35.492 region:rollup2
BEEN.

02:55:34.357 --> 02:55:36.893 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY

02:55:35.492 --> 02:55:38.795 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT AS WE'RE DOING

02:55:36.893 --> 02:55:40.330 region:rollup2
THE STUDIES.

02:55:38.795 --> 02:55:41.765 region:rollup2
AND AND WE'RE DOING ALL OF THIS

02:55:40.330 --> 02:55:43.833 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO CONSIDER WHY. IT

02:55:41.765 --> 02:55:47.137 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE.

02:55:43.833 --> 02:55:49.339 region:rollup2
WHEN A CHILD OR PERSON REVERTS.

02:55:47.137 --> 02:55:50.874 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT IS AN EXTREME

02:55:49.339 --> 02:55:52.142 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY.

02:55:50.874 --> 02:55:54.077 region:rollup2
FOR THAT FAMILY FOR THAT

03:02:01.410 --> 03:02:03.946 region:rollup2
AND LET THEM CONTINUE TO LIVE IN

03:02:02.912 --> 03:02:05.948 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT LIVING ARRANGEMENT.

03:02:03.946 --> 03:02:07.717 region:rollup2
WE ARE JUST ABOUT TO HAVE

03:02:05.948 --> 03:02:10.219 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY CRISIS HOMES WHICH IS

03:02:07.717 --> 03:02:11.387 region:rollup2
REALLY A TERRIFIC MODEL AND I

03:02:10.219 --> 03:02:12.488 region:rollup2
APPLAUD THE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR

03:02:11.387 --> 03:02:13.923 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMITTEE

03:02:12.488 --> 03:02:15.191 region:rollup2
CRISIS HOMES.

03:02:13.923 --> 03:02:18.060 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE

03:02:15.191 --> 03:02:20.329 region:rollup2
SURE IS THAT WE HAVE AFTER

03:02:18.060 --> 03:02:22.532 region:rollup2
SOMEONE'S CRISIS IS AMELIORATED

03:02:20.329 --> 03:02:24.167 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE TO GO

03:02:22.532 --> 03:02:25.902 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T THE

03:02:24.167 --> 03:02:27.603 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY CRISIS HOME WILL

03:02:25.902 --> 03:02:29.505 region:rollup2
BECOME THEIR NEW HOME. WHILE

03:02:27.603 --> 03:02:32.542 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVE

03:02:29.505 --> 03:02:35.678 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENTS AND I DON'T YET

03:02:32.542 --> 03:02:37.914 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE NUMBER AN

03:02:35.678 --> 03:02:39.182 region:rollup2
ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT ARM THAT

03:02:37.914 --> 03:02:42.018 region:rollup2
WE NEED.

03:02:39.182 --> 03:02:44.020 region:rollup2
THE NEXT IS TO REDUCE ARM OUR

03:02:42.018 --> 03:02:46.088 region:rollup2
RELIANCE ON INSTITUTIONS FOR

03:02:44.020 --> 03:02:47.690 region:rollup2
MENTAL DISEASE THAT I TALKED

03:02:46.088 --> 03:02:50.126 region:rollup2
ABOUT OF A FEW MINUTES AGO.

03:02:47.690 --> 03:02:52.862 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WE HAVE A GOOD MODEL IN

03:02:50.126 --> 03:02:54.597 region:rollup2
THE STATE ACUTE CRISIS SERVICES

03:02:52.862 --> 03:02:55.765 region:rollup2
THOSE WORK REALLY WELL.

03:02:54.597 --> 03:02:57.133 region:rollup2
KUDOS TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR

03:02:55.765 --> 03:02:59.368 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING A MODEL THAT ACTUALLY

03:02:57.133 --> 03:03:01.270 region:rollup2
COMPLIES WITH THE STATUTE DOES

03:02:59.368 --> 03:03:02.572 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENTS WORKS

03:03:01.270 --> 03:03:03.172 region:rollup2
HARD TO GET PEOPLE BACK INTO THE

03:03:02.572 --> 03:03:04.941 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WITH THE WITHIN THE

03:03:03.172 --> 03:03:06.943 region:rollup2
TIME LINES.

03:03:04.941 --> 03:03:09.278 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE THAT CAPACITY HAS

03:03:06.943 --> 03:03:11.080 region:rollup2
YET NOT YET BEEN SUFFICIENT WHAT

03:03:09.278 --> 03:03:12.782 region:rollup2
WE END UP DOING IS PLACING

03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:14.951 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS INSTEAD IN

03:03:12.782 --> 03:03:17.186 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL DISEASE.

03:03:14.951 --> 03:03:19.055 region:rollup2
AND THEY STAY THERE AND THEY ARE

03:03:17.186 --> 03:03:20.957 region:rollup2
PLACES WHERE WE NOW GET DATA

03:03:19.055 --> 03:03:22.725 region:rollup2
THAT SHOW VERY HIGH USES OF

03:03:20.957 --> 03:03:24.894 region:rollup2
CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS

03:03:22.725 --> 03:03:26.128 region:rollup2
OF INDIVIDUALS. WE SHOULD WE WE

03:03:24.894 --> 03:03:27.597 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT PEOPLE HAVE A

03:03:26.128 --> 03:03:28.965 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TIME GETTING OUT OF

03:03:27.597 --> 03:03:31.534 region:rollup2
THERE BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A

03:03:28.965 --> 03:03:33.336 region:rollup2
MECHANISM TO DO VERY EFFECTIVE.

03:03:31.534 --> 03:03:34.570 region:rollup2
ON TRANSITION PLANNING.

03:03:33.336 --> 03:03:37.874 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE.

03:03:34.570 --> 03:03:40.877 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WANNA DO IS CHANGE ON

03:03:37.874 --> 03:03:43.045 region:rollup2
HOW PEOPLE GO INTO THESE?

03:03:40.877 --> 03:03:45.214 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL DISEASE

03:03:43.045 --> 03:03:47.316 region:rollup2
AND AND ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN

03:03:45.214 --> 03:03:49.218 region:rollup2
COME OUT MORE QUICKLY SO THE

03:03:47.316 --> 03:03:50.887 region:rollup2
FIRST IS PEOPLE BUT GOING TO THE

03:03:49.218 --> 03:03:52.088 region:rollup2
STATE UNITS AND PEOPLE WERE

03:03:50.887 --> 03:03:53.823 region:rollup2
GOING TO I AM THESE ARE EXACTLY

03:03:52.088 --> 03:03:55.825 region:rollup2
THE SAME PEOPLE BUT WE HAVE

03:03:53.823 --> 03:03:57.560 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ADMISSION CRITERIA. WE

03:03:55.825 --> 03:03:59.962 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE A SINGLE CRITERIA BY

03:03:57.560 --> 03:04:01.998 region:rollup2
WHICH PEOPLE GET ADMITTED TO

03:03:59.962 --> 03:04:03.799 region:rollup2
EITHER ONE OF THOSE PLACES WITH

03:04:01.998 --> 03:04:06.969 region:rollup2
I THINK THE STATE PROVIDING SOME

03:04:03.799 --> 03:04:08.704 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE END

03:04:06.969 --> 03:04:08.871 region:rollup2
UP WHERE THEY AND WHERE THEY END

03:04:08.704 --> 03:04:09.472 region:rollup2
UP.

03:04:08.871 --> 03:04:13.676 region:rollup2
I'M SURE THAT DURING THAT TIME

03:04:09.472 --> 03:04:16.112 region:rollup2
THAT

03:04:13.676 --> 03:04:18.648 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ARE IN I AM DES THAT

03:04:16.112 --> 03:04:20.583 region:rollup2
WE TIMELY TO THE ASSESSMENT

03:04:18.648 --> 03:04:22.852 region:rollup2
CENTER COMPREHENSIVE. AND THAT

03:04:20.583 --> 03:04:24.654 region:rollup2
IS PART OF THAT PROCESS WE TAKE

03:04:22.852 --> 03:04:26.956 region:rollup2
CARE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

03:04:24.654 --> 03:04:29.058 region:rollup2
FIGURING OUT FROM THE BEGINNING

03:04:26.956 --> 03:04:31.193 region:rollup2
WHAT SERVICES THE PERSON NEEDS

03:04:29.058 --> 03:04:33.062 region:rollup2
ON TO LEAVE. I SAY THIS BECAUSE

03:04:31.193 --> 03:04:34.630 region:rollup2
OF INDIVIDUALS WE REPRESENT ON

03:04:33.062 --> 03:04:36.265 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU ONE VERY QUICK EXAMPLE

03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:38.568 region:rollup2
WOULD REPRESENT A YOUNG WOMAN.

03:04:36.265 --> 03:04:40.136 region:rollup2

SOMEBODY ELSE GOT THAT

03:04:48.544 --> 03:04:51.681 region:rollup2
PLACEMENT WE'VE WE NOW

HAVE WE BEEN DOING AND WHAT

03:05:07.296 --> 03:05:11.634 region:rollup2
MONEY HAVE WE BEEN SPENDING SO?

03:05:10.566 --> 03:05:13.536 region:rollup2
TAKING SERIOUSLY AND HONORING

03:05:11.634 --> 03:05:15.404 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN

03:05:13.536 --> 03:05:17.807 region:rollup2
LEAVE AND MOVE TO OTHER LIVING

03:05:15.404 --> 03:05:19.675 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENTS IS REALLY JUST NOT

ONLY GOOD POLICY BETTER USE OF.

03:05:19.675 --> 03:05:23.579 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S ARM THE STATE'S

03:05:21.644 --> 03:05:25.214 region:rollup2
MONEY AND I THINK ONE WAY TO

03:05:23.579 --> 03:05:27.083 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENS WITH A

03:05:25.214 --> 03:05:29.018 region:rollup2
LITTLE MORE FIDELITY IS RIGHT

03:05:27.083 --> 03:05:31.687 region:rollup2
NOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO

03:05:29.018 --> 03:05:33.255 region:rollup2
APPROVE. ANY EXTENSION ARM AT A

03:05:31.687 --> 03:05:34.824 region:rollup2
NINETY DAY MARK WHICH IS HALF

03:05:33.255 --> 03:05:36.692 region:rollup2
WAY THROUGH THE INDIVIDUALS ARM

03:05:34.824 --> 03:05:38.461 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT THERE. INVOLVE THE

03:05:36.692 --> 03:05:40.596 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT EARLIER AND MORE

ARM. REVIEW THIS AT A THIRTY DAY

03:05:42.999 --> 03:05:46.035 region:rollup2
MARK AND EVERY ONGOING THIRTY

03:05:44.533 --> 03:05:47.069 region:rollup2
DAY MARK SO INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT

03:05:46.035 --> 03:05:48.971 region:rollup2
STUCK THERE FOR THREE AND A HALF

03:05:47.069 --> 03:05:51.640 region:rollup2
YEARS ONLY TO LEARN THAT THEY'RE

03:05:48.971 --> 03:05:53.275 region:rollup2
NOT READY TO HAVE. TO MOVE ON

03:05:51.640 --> 03:05:54.343 region:rollup2
OUT THE LAST ONE I'LL TALK ABOUT

03:05:53.275 --> 03:05:56.479 region:rollup2
ON IN THE REST IS JUST IN OUR

03:05:54.343 --> 03:05:59.248 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY IS WE HAVE CLIENTS

03:05:56.479 --> 03:06:00.950 region:rollup2
RIGHTS ADVOCATES ARM. WHO HAVE?

ARE IN THESE RESTRICTIVE LIVING

03:06:02.218 --> 03:06:05.054 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENTS WITH A FAIR AMOUNT

03:06:04.086 --> 03:06:06.622 region:rollup2
OF SUCCESS OF SOME OTHER

03:06:05.054 --> 03:06:08.591 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES OF THAT COULD WORK AT

03:06:06.622 --> 03:06:10.559 region:rollup2
THE END. ONE OF THE WAYS THEY

03:06:08.591 --> 03:06:12.728 region:rollup2
CAN BE MOST EFFECTIVE AND

03:06:10.559 --> 03:06:14.664 region:rollup2
HOPEFUL IN THAT PROCESS IS BY

03:06:12.728 --> 03:06:16.265 region:rollup2
HAVING ACCESS TO THE SAME

03:06:14.664 --> 03:06:17.800 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT OTHER MEMBERS

03:06:16.265 --> 03:06:19.402 region:rollup2
OF THE TEAM HAVE. WHO ARE

03:06:17.800 --> 03:06:21.537 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN THAT TRANSITION

03:06:19.402 --> 03:06:23.072 region:rollup2
PLANNING WE'VE DONE THAT IN SOME

03:06:21.537 --> 03:06:24.707 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THEY GET

03:06:23.072 --> 03:06:26.442 region:rollup2
NOTICED BUT NOT CONSISTENTLY

03:06:24.707 --> 03:06:28.544 region:rollup2
STATUTORILY SO WE WANT TO WORK

03:06:26.442 --> 03:06:30.046 region:rollup2
WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO CLEAN UP

03:08:03.706 --> 03:08:06.909 region:rollup2
CENTER TO BRING WALKING BACK

03:08:05.174 --> 03:08:08.978 region:rollup2
HOME INTO THE COMMUNITY WITH

03:08:06.909 --> 03:08:11.380 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE LIVING SERVICES.

03:08:08.978 --> 03:08:12.715 region:rollup2
HE'S BEEN HOME FOR SIX YEARS.

03:08:11.380 --> 03:08:13.749 region:rollup2
OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN ABLE TO

03:08:12.715 --> 03:08:15.851 region:rollup2
PROVIDE WALKING WITH THE HOME OF

03:08:13.749 --> 03:08:18.654 region:rollup2
HIS OWN THAT IS WALKING A FIGHT

03:08:15.851 --> 03:08:20.089 region:rollup2
AS WE CALL IT. ON OUR PROPERTY.

03:08:18.654 --> 03:08:23.325 region:rollup2
AND CREATIVE SUPPORT THAT ARE

03:08:20.089 --> 03:08:24.660 region:rollup2
PERSONALIZED BASED ON HIS NEEDS.

03:08:23.325 --> 03:08:26.162 region:rollup2
HE'S HAD CRISES SINCE HE'S BEEN

03:08:24.660 --> 03:08:27.863 region:rollup2
HOME.

03:08:26.162 --> 03:08:29.932 region:rollup2
BUT HE AND WE HAVE GOTTEN

03:08:27.863 --> 03:08:30.466 region:rollup2
THROUGH THEM SAFELY BECAUSE OF

03:08:29.932 --> 03:08:32.234 region:rollup2
THE PERSON SENATE CENTER

03:08:30.466 --> 03:08:35.237 region:rollup2
PLANNING. I NEEDED RESOURCES

03:08:32.234 --> 03:08:36.939 region:rollup2
THAT ARE IN PLACE.

03:08:35.237 --> 03:08:38.474 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH OUR FAMILY HAS FUNDED

03:08:36.939 --> 03:08:40.176 region:rollup2
JOAQUIN'S HOUSING.

03:08:38.474 --> 03:08:42.378 region:rollup2
BECAUSE JOAQUIN WAS A DC

03:08:40.176 --> 03:08:45.314 region:rollup2
RESIDENT HE HAS EXTRA FUNDING

03:08:42.378 --> 03:08:47.082 region:rollup2
AND RESOURCES TO HELP ENSURE HIS

03:08:45.314 --> 03:08:48.417 region:rollup2
SUCCESS IN THE COMMUNITY AND FOR

03:08:47.082 --> 03:08:50.319 region:rollup2
THAT OUR FAMILY IS ETERNALLY

03:08:48.417 --> 03:08:51.320 region:rollup2
GRATEFUL.

03:08:50.319 --> 03:08:52.721 region:rollup2
BUT JOAQUIN WOULD NOT HAVE ENDED

03:08:51.320 --> 03:08:55.324 region:rollup2
UP.

03:08:52.721 --> 03:08:57.293 region:rollup2
IN THE DC TWICE.

03:08:55.324 --> 03:08:58.460 region:rollup2
HAD SAFETY NET SERVICES BEEN IN

03:08:57.293 --> 03:09:00.930 region:rollup2
PLACE TO BEGIN WITH.

03:08:58.460 --> 03:09:01.764 region:rollup2
WHEN HE WAS A CHILD.

03:09:00.930 --> 03:09:03.299 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS WHAT WE WANT TO

03:09:01.764 --> 03:09:05.334 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO TODAY.

03:09:03.299 --> 03:09:07.670 region:rollup2
CRISES HAPPEN NOT ONLY TO ADULTS

03:09:05.334 --> 03:09:08.871 region:rollup2
EXITING DC'S BUT THEY ARE VERY

03:09:07.670 --> 03:09:11.173 region:rollup2
REAL FOR MANY FAMILIES MANY

03:09:08.871 --> 03:09:12.541 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WERE LEFT FLOUNDERING

03:09:11.173 --> 03:09:14.510 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HELP WITHOUT HOPE.

03:09:12.541 --> 03:09:15.411 region:rollup2
CRISES HAPPEN.

03:09:14.510 --> 03:09:16.812 region:rollup2
FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND

03:09:15.411 --> 03:09:19.715 region:rollup2
FAMILIES

03:09:16.812 --> 03:09:21.150 region:rollup2
DVD YOU ONCE THE LEGISLATURE TO

03:09:19.715 --> 03:09:22.852 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THIS REALITY AND BE

03:09:21.150 --> 03:09:25.421 region:rollup2
COGNIZANT OF THE IMPACT OF YOUR

03:09:22.852 --> 03:09:28.390 region:rollup2
DECISIONS RELATED TO FUNDING AND

03:09:25.421 --> 03:09:30.125 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT OF DTS.

03:09:28.390 --> 03:09:32.061 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS THAT THE

03:09:30.125 --> 03:09:33.462 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND DTS THE SAFETY

03:09:32.061 --> 03:09:35.364 region:rollup2
NET PLAN HAVE.

03:09:33.462 --> 03:09:36.732 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING SERVICE

03:09:35.364 --> 03:09:38.968 region:rollup2
SERVICES FOURTH FIVE HUNDRED

03:09:36.732 --> 03:09:40.469 region:rollup2
THIRTY FOUR DC MOVERS AND NOT

03:09:38.968 --> 03:09:41.804 region:rollup2
ENOUGH ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID.

03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:43.739 region:rollup2
TWO THE FAR GREATER NUMBER OF

03:09:41.804 --> 03:09:45.107 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE WITH

03:09:43.739 --> 03:09:46.809 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILIES ARE IN COMMUNITY

03:09:45.107 --> 03:09:49.011 region:rollup2
SETTINGS WHO HAVE EQUALLY

03:09:46.809 --> 03:09:51.146 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING SUPPORT NEEDS.

03:09:49.011 --> 03:09:53.282 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT DTS IS

03:09:51.146 --> 03:09:54.550 region:rollup2
PLAN IS MOVING SLOWLY.

03:09:53.282 --> 03:09:56.852 region:rollup2
THE CRISES THAT FAMILIES

03:09:54.550 --> 03:09:58.487 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE ARE VERY REAL AND DC

03:09:56.852 --> 03:10:00.089 region:rollup2
CLOSURES ALTHOUGH A GOOD THING

03:09:58.487 --> 03:10:03.559 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT PEOPLE WILL END UP IN

03:10:00.089 --> 03:10:05.394 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND IN JAILS

03:10:03.559 --> 03:10:07.096 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THERAPEUTIC SERVICES FOR

03:10:05.394 --> 03:10:09.031 region:rollup2
EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME IF WE

03:10:07.096 --> 03:10:11.433 region:rollup2
DO NOT ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE

03:10:09.031 --> 03:10:13.402 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS IN PLACE WITHIN EACH

03:10:11.433 --> 03:10:15.170 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTER AREA.

03:10:13.402 --> 03:10:16.438 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH WE THINK DDS FOR

03:10:15.170 --> 03:10:17.840 region:rollup2
INCLUDING STAKEHOLDERS IN THE

03:10:16.438 --> 03:10:18.340 region:rollup2
PLANNING PROCESS AND WE ARE

03:10:17.840 --> 03:10:19.942 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGED THAT DTS HAS

03:10:18.340 --> 03:10:21.443 region:rollup2
PROMISED.

03:10:19.942 --> 03:10:21.944 region:rollup2
THAT SERVICES WILL BE DEVELOPED

03:10:21.443 --> 03:10:23.245 region:rollup2
THROUGH PERSON CENTERED

03:10:21.944 --> 03:10:24.446 region:rollup2

03:10:23.245 --> 03:10:25.748 region:rollup2
WITH A FOCUS ON CULTURAL

03:10:24.446 --> 03:10:27.082 region:rollup2

SUPPORTS AND TRAUMA INFORMED

CARE.

03:10:28.751 --> 03:10:31.921 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE IS

03:10:30.052 --> 03:10:33.555 region:rollup2
NOT ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE

03:10:31.921 --> 03:10:35.357 region:rollup2
THAT THESE GOALS ARE MET. WITH

03:10:33.555 --> 03:10:37.660 region:rollup2
EACH INDIVIDUAL MEETING SAFETY

NET SERVICES.

03:10:37.660 --> 03:10:40.529 region:rollup2
WE'VE LAID OUT A SET OF

03:10:38.761 --> 03:10:43.232 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REALITY

03:10:40.529 --> 03:10:44.566 region:rollup2
CHECK PAPER. THAT YOU HAVE. WITH

03:10:43.232 --> 03:10:46.268 region:rollup2
THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF KEEPING

03:10:44.566 --> 03:10:47.903 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS IN THEIR

03:10:46.268 --> 03:10:49.605 region:rollup2
HOMES IN THE COMMUNITY BUT THAT

03:10:47.903 --> 03:10:50.973 region:rollup2
IF THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE WE

03:10:49.605 --> 03:10:53.309 region:rollup2
ADVOCATE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF

03:10:50.973 --> 03:10:55.144 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT CAN'T

03:10:53.309 --> 03:10:56.545 region:rollup2
SAY NO.

03:10:55.144 --> 03:10:57.546 region:rollup2
MEANING THEY CANNOT DENY OR

03:10:56.545 --> 03:11:00.516 region:rollup2
REMOVE THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE OF

03:10:57.546 --> 03:11:01.684 region:rollup2
THEIR BEHAVIORS.

03:11:00.516 --> 03:11:03.552 region:rollup2
THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDED EAT

03:11:01.684 --> 03:11:06.956 region:rollup2
DACIANS ARE IN THE PACKET BUT

03:11:03.552 --> 03:11:08.324 region:rollup2
I'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE A FEW.

03:11:06.956 --> 03:11:09.525 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT PARENTS

03:11:08.324 --> 03:11:11.360 region:rollup2
ARE INFORMED ABOUT AVAILABILITY

CONTINUUM OF CRISIS SERVICES

03:11:13.295 --> 03:11:16.665 region:rollup2
THAT SUPPORT PEOPLE STAYING IN

03:11:14.697 --> 03:11:17.900 region:rollup2
THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES.

03:11:16.665 --> 03:11:19.301 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER AND

03:11:17.900 --> 03:11:21.303 region:rollup2

BEHAVIORS.

03:11:29.411 --> 03:11:32.648 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO CREATE DEADLINES NOW

03:11:31.113 --> 03:11:34.283 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PEOPLE IN CRISIS CANNOT

03:11:32.648 --> 03:11:35.651 region:rollup2
WAIT WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT

BUT I THINK WE HAVE SOME

03:32:35.810 --> 03:32:38.813 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT THIS FIVE MILLION

MAY BE LOW. AND THAT. THE

03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:59.433 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT IT COULD CREATE IS

03:32:57.498 --> 03:33:00.701 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE.

TO REFLECT THIS CHANGE IN

03:40:17.538 --> 03:40:21.341 region:rollup2
STATUTE REGIONAL CENTERS USED

03:40:19.406 --> 03:40:23.377 region:rollup2

PURCHASE OF SERVICE POLICIES AND

03:40:29.116 --> 03:40:31.885 region:rollup2
THE LAW REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT

TO APPROVE THOSE POLICIES PRIOR

03:40:31.885 --> 03:40:35.689 region:rollup2

DON'T. ANSWER PROVIDING THAT IN

03:41:41.388 --> 03:41:45.225 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC FORUM I THINK IS AN

03:41:43.257 --> 03:41:47.461 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD THAT.

03:41:45.225 --> 03:41:47.794 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF SPENT ON ONE OF THE

03:41:47.461 --> 03:41:49.596 region:rollup2

AROUND RESPITE. FROM WE HAVE

03:42:04.945 --> 03:42:09.616 region:rollup2
SEEN A FEW OF THOSE PROTOCOLS

03:42:07.881 --> 03:42:10.918 region:rollup2

03:54:34.093 --> 03:54:38.264 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT.

03:54:36.129 --> 03:54:40.733 region:rollup2
DAYS SERVICES OFTENTIMES HELP

03:54:38.264 --> 03:54:42.101 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO BECOME EMPLOYED AND

03:54:40.733 --> 03:54:43.970 region:rollup2
HELP PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THE

03:54:42.101 --> 03:54:45.171 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT. AND OFTENTIMES

03:54:43.970 --> 03:54:46.739 region:rollup2
NGUYEN INDIVIDUALS WITH

03:54:45.171 --> 03:54:48.374 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE

03:54:46.739 --> 03:54:50.176 region:rollup2
WORKING THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT

03:54:48.374 --> 03:54:51.678 region:rollup2
THEY'RE WORKING IN LOW WAGE JOBS

03:54:50.176 --> 03:54:53.112 region:rollup2
AND THEY CAN'T DICTATE THEIR OWN

03:54:51.678 --> 03:54:54.514 region:rollup2
DAYS OFF.

03:54:53.112 --> 03:54:56.349 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE SERVICE PROVIDERS

03:54:54.514 --> 03:54:57.784 region:rollup2
CAN'T.

03:54:56.349 --> 03:54:59.385 region:rollup2
BE PAID FOR THE DAYS THEY

03:54:57.784 --> 03:55:01.854 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THEM FOR SERVICE

03:54:59.385 --> 03:55:03.556 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS ARE FACED WITH EITHER.

03:55:01.854 --> 03:55:04.891 region:rollup2
NOT SUPPORTING THEM AND THE

03:55:03.556 --> 03:55:06.960 region:rollup2
PERSON LOSES THEIR EMPLOYMENT

03:55:04.891 --> 03:55:08.127 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY. OR SUPPORTING THEM

03:55:06.960 --> 03:55:10.330 region:rollup2
IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER GOES

03:55:08.127 --> 03:55:11.631 region:rollup2
WITHOUT PAY.

03:55:10.330 --> 03:55:12.832 region:rollup2
WE DID A SURVEY OF THE REGIONAL

03:55:11.631 --> 03:55:14.701 region:rollup2
CENTERS TO FIND OUT WHAT'S THE

03:55:12.832 --> 03:55:16.436 region:rollup2
CURRENT STATE OUT THERE BECAUSE

03:55:14.701 --> 03:55:18.805 region:rollup2
WE KEEP HEARING A LOT ABOUT. TEN

03:55:16.436 --> 03:55:20.506 region:rollup2
DAYS IS THE NORM. WHAT WE FOUND

03:55:18.805 --> 03:55:21.741 region:rollup2
IS THAT CURRENTLY

03:55:20.506 --> 03:55:22.976 region:rollup2
SEVEN REGIONAL CENTERS ARE

03:55:21.741 --> 03:55:24.477 region:rollup2
OPERATING UNDER A HOLIDAY

03:55:22.976 --> 03:55:26.245 region:rollup2
SCHEDULE?

03:55:24.477 --> 03:55:27.981 region:rollup2
WITH FIVE OF THOSE

03:55:26.245 --> 03:55:30.717 region:rollup2
TAKING TEN DAYS A YEAR ONE

03:55:27.981 --> 03:55:32.585 region:rollup2
TAKING NINE ONE TAKING TWELVE.

03:55:30.717 --> 03:55:34.554 region:rollup2
BUT THE OTHER FOURTEEN CENTERS

03:55:32.585 --> 03:55:36.656 region:rollup2
ARE ALL LETTING THEIR SERVICE

03:55:34.554 --> 03:55:39.292 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS TELL THEM WHEN IT

03:55:36.656 --> 03:55:40.493 region:rollup2
MAKES SENSE FOR THEM TO BE OFF.

03:55:39.292 --> 03:55:43.162 region:rollup2
IF A SERVICE PROVIDER IS

03:55:40.493 --> 03:55:44.764 region:rollup2
PROVIDING SERVICES.

03:55:43.162 --> 03:55:45.932 region:rollup2
AND NOT IN AN EMPLOYMENT SETTING

03:55:44.764 --> 03:55:47.934 region:rollup2
IT LIKELY WON'T MAKE SENSE FOR

03:55:45.932 --> 03:55:50.136 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON FOR THAT PROVIDER TO

03:55:47.934 --> 03:55:51.871 region:rollup2
BE OPEN ON CHRISTMAS DAY.

03:55:50.136 --> 03:55:53.439 region:rollup2
BUT IF A SERVICE PROVIDER IS

03:55:51.871 --> 03:55:55.341 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN

03:55:53.439 --> 03:55:56.843 region:rollup2
RETAIL.

03:55:55.341 --> 03:55:57.977 region:rollup2
IT MAY MEAN THAT THEY REALLY DO

03:55:56.843 --> 03:56:00.446 region:rollup2
NEED TO PROVIDE CRITICAL

03:55:57.977 --> 03:56:02.382 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS ON THANKSGIVING.

03:56:00.446 --> 03:56:03.683 region:rollup2
SO OUR CODE IS.

03:56:02.382 --> 03:56:06.285 region:rollup2
JOINING WITH THE ARE CAN YOU SEE

03:56:03.683 --> 03:56:07.787 region:rollup2
P. AND MANY MANY OTHER GROUPS IN

03:56:06.285 --> 03:56:08.254 region:rollup2

03:56:07.787 --> 03:56:08.921 region:rollup2

THOSE ON ADDITIONAL SERVICES BE

03:56:50.029 --> 03:56:53.232 region:rollup2
COVERED BY IT BUT BELIEVE THAT

03:56:51.798 --> 03:56:55.034 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION OF THE STATUTE

03:56:53.232 --> 03:56:56.335 region:rollup2

AND.

03:57:03.976 --> 03:57:06.712 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS

03:57:05.244 --> 03:57:08.147 region:rollup2
THREE OPTIONS ON THIS ISSUE IT

03:57:06.712 --> 03:57:09.615 region:rollup2
CAN IMPROVE THE PURPOSE THE

03:57:08.147 --> 03:57:10.950 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL CAN

03:57:09.615 --> 03:57:13.453 region:rollup2
REJECTED OUTRIGHT OR IT COULD DO

03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:14.187 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF COMPROMISE WHERE IT

03:57:13.453 --> 03:57:16.556 region:rollup2
APPROVES.

03:57:14.187 --> 03:57:18.658 region:rollup2
AND A UNIFORM HOLIDAY POLICY

03:57:16.556 --> 03:57:20.226 region:rollup2
BUT REDUCES THE NUMBER OF DAYS

03:57:18.658 --> 03:57:21.461 region:rollup2
TO SAY TEN.

03:57:20.226 --> 03:57:23.262 region:rollup2
AT THIS TIME WE'D LIKE TO JUST

03:57:21.461 --> 03:57:25.565 region:rollup2

VARIOUS OPTIONS SO.

03:57:27.500 --> 03:57:31.704 region:rollup2
ONE THING TO KNOW IS THAT WHEN.

03:57:30.303 --> 03:57:33.606 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE

03:57:31.704 --> 03:57:35.074 region:rollup2

ENFORCED SINCE THAT TIME. WHAT

03:57:38.811 --> 03:57:43.349 region:rollup2
THIS MEANS IS AS MS WAS LAYING?

03:57:41.147 --> 03:57:43.950 region:rollup2
NOTED A LOT OF THE REGIONAL

03:57:43.349 --> 03:57:45.451 region:rollup2
CENTERS HAVE EITHER GONE BACK

03:57:43.950 --> 03:57:47.820 region:rollup2

03:57:45.451 --> 03:57:49.655 region:rollup2
HOLIDAY POLICY OF TEN DAYS NINE

03:57:47.820 --> 03:57:51.757 region:rollup2

DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC AND SET

03:57:51.757 --> 03:57:55.461 region:rollup2
HOLIDAY POLICY. WHAT THIS MEANS

03:57:53.993 --> 03:57:56.329 region:rollup2
IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE

03:57:55.461 --> 03:57:57.797 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T PUT?

03:57:56.329 --> 03:57:59.565 region:rollup2
URGENT REQUEST FUNDING TO PUT

QUIT ENFORCING THE POLICY IT

03:58:01.767 --> 03:58:03.436 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT.

03:58:02.068 --> 03:58:04.437 region:rollup2
.

03:58:03.436 --> 03:58:06.506 region:rollup2
SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE LIKELY

03:58:04.437 --> 03:58:07.240 region:rollup2
BILLING FOR THESE SERVICES ON

03:58:06.506 --> 03:58:09.876 region:rollup2
THOSE ADDITIONAL DAYS ON THE

03:58:07.240 --> 03:58:11.244 region:rollup2
NATURAL. SO IF THE LEGISLATURE

03:58:09.876 --> 03:58:12.578 region:rollup2
WERE TO.

03:58:11.244 --> 03:58:14.347 region:rollup2

HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE

03:58:21.854 --> 03:58:26.592 region:rollup2
TO REJECT THE POLICY WE THINK

03:58:24.257 --> 03:58:29.195 region:rollup2
THAT THE ADDITIONAL COST

03:58:26.592 --> 03:58:30.296 region:rollup2

CENTERS WANTED TO DO WOULD ONLY

03:58:32.131 --> 03:58:36.335 region:rollup2
COST ME ABOUT THREE MILLION.

03:58:34.367 --> 03:58:37.637 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND BECAUSE SERVICE

03:58:36.335 --> 03:58:38.538 region:rollup2

03:58:37.637 --> 03:58:40.540 region:rollup2
DOING FOR THOSE DAYS

03:58:38.538 --> 03:58:44.143 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES IT.

AND THERE IS NO UNIFORMITY WE

03:59:03.196 --> 03:59:06.332 region:rollup2
WOULD RECOMMEND THAT ANY CHANGE

04:02:02.074 --> 04:02:06.512 region:rollup2
HARMED.

04:02:03.442 --> 04:02:08.347 region:rollup2
IMPOSING THIS REDUCTION NOW.

04:02:06.512 --> 04:02:10.049 region:rollup2
IT IS SIMPLY UNFAIR AND THAT'S

04:02:08.347 --> 04:02:12.485 region:rollup2
HOW IT NEEDS TO BE VIEWED IT AS

04:02:10.049 --> 04:02:14.120 region:rollup2
THE SUN FAIR. AND IF YOU LOOK AT

04:02:12.485 --> 04:02:16.789 region:rollup2
THE FACT HOW THE STATE VIEWS

04:02:14.120 --> 04:02:18.357 region:rollup2

JUST FROM DEVELOPMENT SERVICES

04:02:21.694 --> 04:02:24.296 region:rollup2
IN OTHER AREAS I JUST SAYS MEDI

04:02:22.795 --> 04:02:25.197 region:rollup2

DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES.

04:02:29.668 --> 04:02:31.504 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE OF

04:02:30.703 --> 04:02:33.339 region:rollup2
THE RATE STUDY.

04:02:31.504 --> 04:02:34.774 region:rollup2
IT.

04:02:33.339 --> 04:02:36.108 region:rollup2
GOING ON THAT LOGIC THOUGH IF

YOU'RE NOT BEEN IMPOSED ACROSS

04:02:36.108 --> 04:02:40.112 region:rollup2
THE BOARD RATE INCREASES OR

04:02:38.377 --> 04:02:42.148 region:rollup2
FUNDING RESOURCES BECAUSE THERE

04:02:40.112 --> 04:02:43.649 region:rollup2

04:02:42.148 --> 04:02:44.216 region:rollup2

04:02:53.592 --> 04:02:55.761 region:rollup2
RATHER IN THE REJECT IT

04:02:54.827 --> 04:02:57.563 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY BECAUSE I KNOW

04:02:55.761 --> 04:02:59.465 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DOESN'T LIKE TO DO

04:02:57.563 --> 04:02:59.965 region:rollup2

OF THINGS AND ALSO DOES IT MAKE

04:03:12.077 --> 04:03:14.613 region:rollup2
SENSE OF THIS IS HOW WHAT THE

04:03:13.479 --> 04:03:15.748 region:rollup2

NEWLY ELIGIBLE BY THIS BUDGET

04:12:22.527 --> 04:12:24.029 region:rollup2
REQUEST ROUND AFTER FOUR

04:12:23.028 --> 04:12:25.263 region:rollup2
HUNDRED.

04:12:24.029 --> 04:12:26.832 region:rollup2
THE TOTAL ANNUAL FUNDING

04:12:25.263 --> 04:12:28.600 region:rollup2
INCREASES ESTIMATED AT FIVE

04:12:26.832 --> 04:12:30.168 region:rollup2
POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS.

04:12:28.600 --> 04:12:31.937 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD INCLUDE A FORTY ONE

04:12:30.168 --> 04:12:33.538 region:rollup2
PERCENT UP FROM FEDERAL FUNDS

04:12:31.937 --> 04:12:35.540 region:rollup2
AND FIFTY NINE PERCENT STATE

GENERAL FUNDS OF THREE POINT ONE

04:12:35.540 --> 04:12:38.677 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

04:12:37.409 --> 04:12:40.445 region:rollup2
THIS AMOUNT IS LESS THAN ONE

04:12:38.677 --> 04:12:41.813 region:rollup2
TENTH OF ONE PERCENT OF THE

04:12:40.445 --> 04:12:43.682 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTER SPY POINT FIVE

04:12:41.813 --> 04:12:45.550 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL BUDGET.

04:12:43.682 --> 04:12:46.885 region:rollup2
WOULD RECTIFY DECADES LONG IN

04:12:45.550 --> 04:12:48.286 region:rollup2
EQUITY IN THE LA FOR SOME OF OUR

04:12:46.885 --> 04:12:50.622 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING YOUNG DEVELOPMENTALLY

04:12:48.286 --> 04:12:51.123 region:rollup2
DISABLED CALIFORNIANS. AND HELP

04:12:50.622 --> 04:12:52.624 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATE SOME OF THEIR

04:12:51.123 --> 04:12:54.426 region:rollup2
SUFFERING.

04:12:52.624 --> 04:12:55.894 region:rollup2
SOME OLDER CASES OF TRAUMATIC OR

04:12:54.426 --> 04:12:57.963 region:rollup2
ACQUIRED BRAIN INJURY FROM PRIOR

04:12:55.894 --> 04:12:59.665 region:rollup2
USED WHAT ALSO BECOME ELIGIBLE

04:12:57.963 --> 04:13:00.999 region:rollup2
IN THIS NUMBER IS LESS CLEAR.

04:12:59.665 --> 04:13:02.234 region:rollup2
YET IT WOULD BE A LOGICAL TO

04:13:00.999 --> 04:13:04.136 region:rollup2
ASSUME THAT PRIOR YEARS WOULD

04:13:02.234 --> 04:13:06.038 region:rollup2
HAVE HIGHER NUMBERS. THE MORE

04:13:04.136 --> 04:13:07.873 region:rollup2
LIKELY BE LOWER MOST OF THOSE

04:13:06.038 --> 04:13:08.473 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE ALREADY

04:13:07.873 --> 04:13:09.541 region:rollup2
FOUND AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF

04:13:08.473 --> 04:13:10.475 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

04:13:09.541 --> 04:13:12.044 region:rollup2
OTHERS AND PARTIALLY WILL NOT OF

04:13:10.475 --> 04:13:13.211 region:rollup2
SURVIVED.

04:13:12.044 --> 04:13:14.680 region:rollup2
ALSO SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE

04:13:13.211 --> 04:13:16.682 region:rollup2
DENIED SERVICES DUE TO THEIR AGE

04:13:14.680 --> 04:13:17.983 region:rollup2
OF ONSET WILL HAVE FALLEN INTO.

04:13:16.682 --> 04:13:19.418 region:rollup2
LEVELS HAD A DISABILITY THAT

04:13:17.983 --> 04:13:21.686 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD IT BEEN

04:13:19.418 --> 04:13:22.888 region:rollup2
GIVEN TIMELY SUPPORT SERVICES.

04:13:21.686 --> 04:13:24.289 region:rollup2
AND MAY NOW HAVE GREATER STATE

04:13:22.888 --> 04:13:25.891 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES BEING SPENT ON THEM

04:13:24.289 --> 04:13:27.192 region:rollup2
AND LONG TERM FACILITIES

04:13:25.891 --> 04:13:28.960 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THIS BUDGET REQUEST

04:13:27.192 --> 04:13:30.462 region:rollup2
WOULD PREVENT GOING FORWARD.

04:13:28.960 --> 04:13:31.530 region:rollup2
OUR REGIONAL CENTER SPECIALIZED

04:13:30.462 --> 04:13:32.764 region:rollup2
PROVIDING COMMUNITY BASED

04:13:31.530 --> 04:13:34.299 region:rollup2
SERVICES WHICH ENABLE

04:13:32.764 --> 04:13:35.967 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

04:13:34.299 --> 04:13:37.903 region:rollup2
THE CIVIL ADD DISABILITIES.

04:13:35.967 --> 04:13:39.004 region:rollup2
SUCH AS A PARTY DRAMATIC BRAIN

04:13:37.903 --> 04:13:41.740 region:rollup2
INJURY TO CHIEF THEIR FULL

04:13:39.004 --> 04:13:43.108 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL. AND HIGHEST LEVEL

04:13:41.740 --> 04:13:45.444 region:rollup2
SELF SUFFICIENCY.

04:13:43.108 --> 04:13:45.977 region:rollup2
THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR THAT IF WE

04:13:45.444 --> 04:13:48.146 region:rollup2
GIVE THESE INDIVIDUALS THE

04:13:45.977 --> 04:13:49.648 region:rollup2
MEDICAL. NECESSARY TREATMENT

04:13:48.146 --> 04:13:51.683 region:rollup2
THEY NEED THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF

04:13:49.648 --> 04:13:53.151 region:rollup2
REHABILITATION THAT LISA HIGHER

04:13:51.683 --> 04:13:54.453 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF SELF SUFFICIENCY WILL

04:13:53.151 --> 04:13:56.688 region:rollup2
BE GREATER AND THEY WILL

04:13:54.453 --> 04:13:58.190 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY BE MUCH LESS OF A

04:13:56.688 --> 04:13:59.658 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL BURDEN TO THE STATE.

04:13:58.190 --> 04:14:01.626 region:rollup2
ALSO IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT TB

04:13:59.658 --> 04:14:03.161 region:rollup2
AYE IN INCIDENCES ARE DECLINING

04:14:01.626 --> 04:14:05.063 region:rollup2
GRADUALLY AND HAVE BEEN FOR

04:14:03.161 --> 04:14:06.598 region:rollup2
YEARS LIKELY DUE TO GREATER

04:14:05.063 --> 04:14:08.400 region:rollup2
AWARENESS AND PREVENTION.

04:14:06.598 --> 04:14:09.835 region:rollup2
CHANGING AGE OF ONSET DEFINITION

04:14:08.400 --> 04:14:11.636 region:rollup2
WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO

04:14:09.835 --> 04:14:12.771 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY SERVE ALL OF THE

04:14:11.636 --> 04:14:14.372 region:rollup2

DISABLED CALIFORNIANS NOT JUST

04:14:14.372 --> 04:14:17.309 region:rollup2

THROUGH THE PROCESS IF YOU HAD

04:14:59.751 --> 04:15:01.153 region:rollup2
AN INVALID.

04:15:00.051 --> 04:15:03.121 region:rollup2
TOP.

04:15:01.153 --> 04:15:05.090 region:rollup2
SO IN A VARIETY OF REASONS I'M

04:15:03.121 --> 04:15:06.158 region:rollup2
VERY INTERESTED THE TOPIC AND

04:15:05.090 --> 04:15:08.093 region:rollup2
I'VE GOT TO BE A PART OF THE

04:15:06.158 --> 04:15:10.028 region:rollup2

04:15:10.028 --> 04:15:12.564 region:rollup2
PARODY ISSUE.

04:15:11.396 --> 04:15:14.032 region:rollup2
AW WHEN YOU END UP WITH A

04:15:12.564 --> 04:15:15.867 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT'S

04:15:14.032 --> 04:15:17.402 region:rollup2
BACKED UP OF THE FACT THAT THE

04:15:15.867 --> 04:15:18.937 region:rollup2
BRAIN DOES CONTINUE TO DEVELOP

04:15:17.402 --> 04:15:19.504 region:rollup2
TELL AT THE STATE'S TWENTY TWO

04:15:18.937 --> 04:15:21.339 region:rollup2
OF NOT TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY

04:15:19.504 --> 04:15:23.275 region:rollup2
SIX.

04:15:21.339 --> 04:15:25.410 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT GOT THE SCIENTIFIC

04:15:23.275 --> 04:15:27.045 region:rollup2
BACKING BUT WE'VE ALSO HAD THE

04:15:25.410 --> 04:15:29.114 region:rollup2
MEDICAL COMMUNITY BEHIND IT.

04:15:27.045 --> 04:15:32.317 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD THE THE NATIONAL.

04:15:29.114 --> 04:15:33.451 region:rollup2

EVEN GOES UP TO AGE TWENTY TWO

04:15:41.726 --> 04:15:44.796 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PUBLIC

04:15:42.894 --> 04:15:46.431 region:rollup2
FUNDED DOLLARS. IT'S LIKE

04:15:44.796 --> 04:15:48.600 region:rollup2
EVERYONE ELSE IN THE SYSTEMS ARE

04:15:54.840 --> 04:15:58.276 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE OUR REGIONAL CENTER

SERVICES A MUCH SMALLER SUBSET

04:15:58.276 --> 04:16:01.213 region:rollup2
OF ALL OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

04:15:59.211 --> 04:16:02.948 region:rollup2

THE IN THE COUNTRY ON THE.

04:16:04.549 --> 04:16:08.386 region:rollup2
ON THE ISSUE OF OF WHAT

04:16:07.285 --> 04:16:11.122 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES TO TO DEVELOPMENT

04:16:08.386 --> 04:16:12.324 region:rollup2
DISABILITY AND MORE THAT AGES SO

04:16:11.122 --> 04:16:13.758 region:rollup2
PROPULSIVE PERSPECTIVE WE

04:16:12.324 --> 04:16:16.027 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE.

04:16:13.758 --> 04:16:18.496 region:rollup2
IT TO COME TO TWENTY TWO. NOW

04:16:16.027 --> 04:16:20.865 region:rollup2

SACRAMENTO A NUMBER OF TIMES OF

04:16:26.538 --> 04:16:30.308 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A TWO TIER BAD BRAIN

04:16:28.106 --> 04:16:31.243 region:rollup2
INJURY PROGRAM I'VE ALWAYS BEEN

04:16:30.308 --> 04:16:32.677 region:rollup2
VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT

04:16:31.243 --> 04:16:33.945 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING AND I BELIEVE OUR

04:16:32.677 --> 04:16:35.313 region:rollup2
OTHER WITNESS HERE IS GONNA BE

04:16:33.945 --> 04:16:37.015 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GIVE A PERSONAL

04:16:35.313 --> 04:16:38.550 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OF. OF HOW VARIOUS.

04:16:37.015 --> 04:16:39.651 region:rollup2
.

04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:41.386 region:rollup2
I TALKED WITH THEIR EXECUTIVE

04:16:39.651 --> 04:16:44.389 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR JUST THIS WEEK BECAUSE

04:16:41.386 --> 04:16:45.991 region:rollup2
I WAS ASKING FOR THE TBI PROGRAM

04:16:44.389 --> 04:16:46.958 region:rollup2
WATER THE NUMBERS GOING TO BE

04:16:45.991 --> 04:16:48.727 region:rollup2
AND ARE WE LOOKING AT KIND OF

04:16:46.958 --> 04:16:49.628 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT'S THE UPTAKE. IS

04:16:48.727 --> 04:16:51.429 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WHO'S GOING TO BE

04:16:49.628 --> 04:16:53.231 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO

04:16:51.429 --> 04:16:54.432 region:rollup2
BE FLOODING THE SYSTEM. AND WHAT

04:16:53.231 --> 04:16:55.267 region:rollup2
THEY WERE SAYING IS THEY THEY

04:16:54.432 --> 04:16:56.601 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE

04:16:55.267 --> 04:16:59.437 region:rollup2
THE CASE AT ALL.

04:16:56.601 --> 04:17:01.773 region:rollup2
AND KEEP IN MIND THAT EVEN WHEN

04:16:59.437 --> 04:17:03.308 region:rollup2
YOU'RE RUNNING A TBI SOONER YOUR

04:17:01.773 --> 04:17:04.843 region:rollup2
NUMBERS ARE VERY LARGE SO I

04:17:03.308 --> 04:17:06.544 region:rollup2
THINK THEY NORMALLY RUN.

04:17:04.843 --> 04:17:09.080 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE

04:17:06.544 --> 04:17:10.015 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN THE GET PEOPLE

04:17:09.080 --> 04:17:11.116 region:rollup2
FROM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA.

04:17:10.015 --> 04:17:13.385 region:rollup2
ON.

04:17:11.116 --> 04:17:15.220 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING MANAGEMENT STAFF

04:17:13.385 --> 04:17:16.554 region:rollup2
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AYE AND

04:17:15.220 --> 04:17:18.056 region:rollup2
UP WITH PEOPLE WHO FIND OUR

04:17:16.554 --> 04:17:19.591 region:rollup2
SERVICES BECAUSE THEY'RE SO

04:17:18.056 --> 04:17:21.359 region:rollup2
ALIGNED WITH INDEPENDENT LIVING

04:17:19.591 --> 04:17:22.494 region:rollup2
IN SUPPORT OF LIVING. THAT

04:17:21.359 --> 04:17:24.696 region:rollup2
THEY'LL MAKE THE REQUEST

04:17:22.494 --> 04:17:26.498 region:rollup2
ARE ONLY TO FIND OUT LATER THAT

04:17:24.696 --> 04:17:27.999 region:rollup2
THEY MISSED THE CUT OFF AGE.

04:17:26.498 --> 04:17:29.267 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW I LOOK AT THE

04:17:27.999 --> 04:17:30.869 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT THEY

04:17:29.267 --> 04:17:33.338 region:rollup2

04:17:30.869 --> 04:17:35.273 region:rollup2
FIT FROM OUR. LONG TERM SERVICE

04:17:33.338 --> 04:17:37.175 region:rollup2
AND SUPPORT PERSPECTIVE BUT THEY

04:17:35.273 --> 04:17:38.209 region:rollup2
MISSED THE CUT OFF AGE SO I

04:17:37.175 --> 04:17:41.446 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY HEART

04:17:38.209 --> 04:17:44.282 region:rollup2
WRENCHING. BECAUSE IT JULIA.

04:17:41.446 --> 04:17:45.850 region:rollup2
WEEK EARLIER A YEAR EARLIER THEY

04:17:44.282 --> 04:17:47.619 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE HAD A MUCH

04:17:45.850 --> 04:17:51.022 region:rollup2
BETTER FUTURE IN FRONT OF THEM.

04:17:47.619 --> 04:17:52.724 region:rollup2
.

04:17:51.022 --> 04:17:53.358 region:rollup2
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL WHICH OF

04:17:52.724 --> 04:17:54.893 region:rollup2
COURSE IS ALWAYS MUCH HARDER TO

04:17:53.358 --> 04:17:57.562 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT.

04:17:54.893 --> 04:17:59.364 region:rollup2
.

04:17:57.562 --> 04:18:00.398 region:rollup2
AND IT WENT THROUGH WE WIN

04:17:59.364 --> 04:18:01.466 region:rollup2
THROUGH TIME AT.

04:18:00.398 --> 04:18:03.435 region:rollup2
.

04:18:01.466 --> 04:18:05.170 region:rollup2
PALO ALTO.

04:18:03.435 --> 04:18:06.571 region:rollup2
OH WELL MY GRANDSON WAS GETTING

04:18:05.170 --> 04:18:08.406 region:rollup2
SURGERIES THERE WENT THROUGH

04:18:06.571 --> 04:18:10.241 region:rollup2
SURGERIES FOR ABOUT IT AYE A

04:18:08.406 --> 04:18:12.177 region:rollup2
YEAR MAYBE A YEAR PLUS.

04:18:10.241 --> 04:18:13.445 region:rollup2
ANTI WE STAYED UP ON AND OFF AT

04:18:12.177 --> 04:18:15.380 region:rollup2
THE FAMILY UNIT THAT WAS THERE

04:18:13.445 --> 04:18:17.015 region:rollup2
SO I GOT TO KNOW NOT ONLY HIS

04:18:15.380 --> 04:18:18.583 region:rollup2
CARE BUT ALL OF THE OTHER PEOPLE

04:18:17.015 --> 04:18:20.719 region:rollup2
WHO WERE THERE. FROM ACROSS THE

04:18:18.583 --> 04:18:22.487 region:rollup2
COUNTRY SO IF WE'RE PREPARING

04:18:20.719 --> 04:18:23.455 region:rollup2
NUMBERS AND PROJECTIONS BASED ON

04:18:22.487 --> 04:18:25.256 region:rollup2
HOW MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

04:18:23.455 --> 04:18:26.992 region:rollup2
GET THE SURGERY JUST REMEMBER

04:18:25.256 --> 04:18:28.059 region:rollup2
THAT SOME OF THOSE HOSPITALS.

04:18:26.992 --> 04:18:29.427 region:rollup2
ARE LITERALLY ACTING AS A

04:18:28.059 --> 04:18:32.130 region:rollup2
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY FOR

04:18:29.427 --> 04:18:32.731 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND YET THEY

04:18:32.130 --> 04:18:33.698 region:rollup2
ARE STILL SMALL.

04:18:32.731 --> 04:18:34.799 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT

04:18:33.698 --> 04:18:36.534 region:rollup2
NUMBERS I DON'T THINK WE'RE

04:18:34.799 --> 04:18:38.169 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT LARGE NUMBERS IN YOU

04:18:36.534 --> 04:18:39.971 region:rollup2
LOOKING CLEARLY THAT THAT. THE

04:18:38.169 --> 04:18:41.940 region:rollup2
MEDICAL GETS TAKEN CARE OF SO

04:18:39.971 --> 04:18:45.076 region:rollup2
FAR IN ADVANCE OF WHEN THE LONG

04:18:41.940 --> 04:18:46.077 region:rollup2
TERM CARE LONG TERM SERVICES A

04:18:45.076 --> 04:18:47.812 region:rollup2
SUPPORT KICK HIM.

04:18:46.077 --> 04:18:48.079 region:rollup2
SO MY GRANDSON WAS.

04:18:47.812 --> 04:18:49.414 region:rollup2
GETTING.

04:18:48.079 --> 04:18:50.715 region:rollup2
.

04:18:49.414 --> 04:18:52.784 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE SURGERIES.

04:18:50.715 --> 04:18:54.519 region:rollup2
.

04:18:52.784 --> 04:18:57.088 region:rollup2
THEN HE TRANSFERRED TO.

04:18:54.519 --> 04:18:58.723 region:rollup2
A REHAB FACILITY AND THEN HE

04:18:57.088 --> 04:19:00.225 region:rollup2
TRANSFERRED TO CAST THE COLINA.

04:18:58.723 --> 04:19:01.626 region:rollup2
SO ON THE REVIEW HAVE FACILITY

04:19:00.225 --> 04:19:03.762 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL LOOKING AT VERY

04:19:01.626 --> 04:19:06.231 region:rollup2
MUCH MEDICAL. AND ABOUT THE.

04:19:03.762 --> 04:19:08.066 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONAL LIVING CENTER THEY

04:19:06.231 --> 04:19:10.368 region:rollup2
SERVE FORTY TWO PEOPLE AND THEY

04:19:08.066 --> 04:19:11.002 region:rollup2
ARE PRIMARILY FROM CALIFORNIA I

04:19:10.368 --> 04:19:12.103 region:rollup2
THINK PROBABLY SOME FROM OUT OF

04:19:11.002 --> 04:19:12.871 region:rollup2
STATE.

04:19:12.103 --> 04:19:15.140 region:rollup2
AND.

04:19:12.871 --> 04:19:17.142 region:rollup2
THEY'LL HAVE A GRADUATED.

04:19:15.140 --> 04:19:18.943 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF INDEPENDENT

04:19:17.142 --> 04:19:20.979 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING I GOT TO KNOW THAT

04:19:18.943 --> 04:19:22.347 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PROGRAM WELL WELL I

04:19:20.979 --> 04:19:23.782 region:rollup2
WATCHED MY GRANDSON AND THE

04:19:22.347 --> 04:19:24.849 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT HE WAS GOING TO THE

04:19:23.782 --> 04:19:25.016 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WITH.

04:19:24.849 --> 04:19:27.986 region:rollup2
AND.

04:19:25.016 --> 04:19:29.621 region:rollup2
.

04:19:27.986 --> 04:19:32.557 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THE UPTAKE IN

04:19:29.621 --> 04:19:33.491 region:rollup2
THERE IT IS. EITHER IT IS ALSO

04:19:32.557 --> 04:19:35.994 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO BE A HUNDRED

04:19:33.491 --> 04:19:37.328 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF AYE. ION.

04:19:35.994 --> 04:19:38.463 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT AS OUR GRADUATING

04:19:37.328 --> 04:19:39.831 region:rollup2
TO GREATER LEVELS OF

04:19:38.463 --> 04:19:41.900 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENCE.

04:19:39.831 --> 04:19:42.434 region:rollup2
AND GIMMICK THAT WAS COVERED BY

04:19:41.900 --> 04:19:44.302 region:rollup2
MEDICAL SO HE WOULDN'T SEE

04:19:42.434 --> 04:19:45.770 region:rollup2
HE.

04:19:44.302 --> 04:19:47.472 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WHO WILL CHOOSE IT

04:19:45.770 --> 04:19:48.440 region:rollup2
WOULD TRANSITION TO A REGIONAL

04:19:47.472 --> 04:19:50.041 region:rollup2
CENTER FUNDED SERVICE WITH A

04:19:48.440 --> 04:19:51.709 region:rollup2
WARM HAND OFF.

04:19:50.041 --> 04:19:52.877 region:rollup2
WHICH IS EXACTLY HOW WE WOULD.

04:19:51.709 --> 04:19:54.512 region:rollup2
ALWAYS WATER SYSTEM IN

04:19:52.877 --> 04:19:55.780 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO BE.

04:19:54.512 --> 04:19:58.349 region:rollup2
SO ARE WE THINK THAT.

04:19:55.780 --> 04:19:59.884 region:rollup2
IT MAKES A LOT OF THINGS AYE

04:19:58.349 --> 04:20:02.220 region:rollup2
AYE TOPPED A MODEL THE WAY THEY

04:19:59.884 --> 04:20:02.854 region:rollup2
HAD SET UP THE MODEL WAS VERY

04:20:02.220 --> 04:20:03.588 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE WOULD SET

04:20:02.854 --> 04:20:05.657 region:rollup2
UP.

04:20:03.588 --> 04:20:07.192 region:rollup2
A THE STEPS OF GREATER LEVEL OF

04:20:05.657 --> 04:20:08.593 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENCE WITHIN OUR REGIONAL

04:20:07.192 --> 04:20:11.029 region:rollup2
CENTER FUNDED SERVICES.

04:20:08.593 --> 04:20:13.064 region:rollup2
.

04:20:11.029 --> 04:20:14.566 region:rollup2
SO FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.

04:20:13.064 --> 04:20:16.367 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT BECAUSE OF THE

04:20:14.566 --> 04:20:17.735 region:rollup2
PARODY ARGUMENT I ALSO THINK

04:20:16.367 --> 04:20:19.504 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE LONG TERM

04:20:17.735 --> 04:20:21.272 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS NEEDED.

04:20:19.504 --> 04:20:23.108 region:rollup2
AND THE FACT THAT LITERALLY AS A

04:20:21.272 --> 04:20:24.976 region:rollup2
PROVIDER WE ARE SERVING THE

04:20:23.108 --> 04:20:26.277 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH THE EXACT SAME.

04:20:24.976 --> 04:20:28.446 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF NEED.

04:20:26.277 --> 04:20:30.682 region:rollup2
IT JUST HAPPENED A YEAR OR TWO

04:20:28.446 --> 04:20:32.584 region:rollup2
BEFORETHE PRIOR CUT OFF SO I

04:20:30.682 --> 04:20:34.319 region:rollup2
THINK OUR SYSTEM IS SET UP FOR

04:20:32.584 --> 04:20:35.553 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO HANDLE IT AND OR

04:20:34.319 --> 04:20:36.855 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS

04:20:35.553 --> 04:20:38.122 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY UNDER PERSON CENTERED

04:20:36.855 --> 04:20:40.358 region:rollup2
PLANNING. AND I THINK OUR

04:20:38.122 --> 04:20:41.993 region:rollup2
SERVICES WERE VERY ALIGNED

04:20:40.358 --> 04:20:44.729 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WITH KATHLEEN A MODEL.

04:20:41.993 --> 04:20:45.330 region:rollup2
SO FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS I I

04:20:44.729 --> 04:20:47.632 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOUR

04:20:45.330 --> 04:20:49.667 region:rollup2
SUPPORT AND I JUST WANT ONE LAST

04:20:47.632 --> 04:20:49.968 region:rollup2
PLEA BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO

04:20:49.667 --> 04:20:52.470 region:rollup2
OUR PARENTS.

04:20:49.968 --> 04:20:54.739 region:rollup2
.

04:20:52.470 --> 04:20:57.108 region:rollup2
PERHAPS IT'S ALWAYS THE PARENTS

04:20:54.739 --> 04:21:00.278 region:rollup2
THE PARENTS WERE THERE AT EVERY

04:20:57.108 --> 04:21:01.646 region:rollup2
STEP BUT PALO ALTO. WE WERE ALL

04:21:00.278 --> 04:21:03.982 region:rollup2
THERE WE.

04:21:01.646 --> 04:21:05.016 region:rollup2
.

04:21:03.982 --> 04:21:07.352 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE FOUGHT FOR THE

04:21:05.016 --> 04:21:08.620 region:rollup2
HEALTH OF OF ARE CERTAIN SIN

04:21:07.352 --> 04:21:09.888 region:rollup2
DOCTORS AND THEIR SONS AND

04:21:08.620 --> 04:21:10.321 region:rollup2
DAUGHTERS.

04:21:09.888 --> 04:21:11.956 region:rollup2
AND.

04:21:10.321 --> 04:21:13.591 region:rollup2
THE PARENTS ARE ALWAYS GONNA BE

04:21:11.956 --> 04:21:14.526 region:rollup2
THERE SO THE PARENTS ARE ASKING

04:21:13.591 --> 04:21:16.294 region:rollup2
FOR.

04:21:14.526 --> 04:21:17.529 region:rollup2
THE SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT OF

04:21:16.294 --> 04:21:19.831 region:rollup2
OTHER PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

04:21:17.529 --> 04:21:23.034 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES. AND LET ME TURN IT

04:21:19.831 --> 04:21:24.802 region:rollup2
OVER TO HER PARENTS IF YOU.

04:21:23.034 --> 04:21:27.172 region:rollup2

MY SON AND HOW IMPORTANT THIS

04:21:35.613 --> 04:21:39.250 region:rollup2
ISSUE IS FOR FAMILIES AS WELL AS

04:21:37.916 --> 04:21:41.386 region:rollup2
FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE.

04:21:39.250 --> 04:21:43.721 region:rollup2
OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

04:21:41.386 --> 04:21:45.056 region:rollup2
I WAS SO GRATEFUL TO DR

04:21:43.721 --> 04:21:46.591 region:rollup2
BLOOMBERG WHO IS EXECUTIVE

04:21:45.056 --> 04:21:47.859 region:rollup2

04:21:47.859 --> 04:21:51.462 region:rollup2
KNEW OF SENATOR WILKES.

EFFORTS AND ENCOURAGE ME TO

04:21:51.462 --> 04:21:55.667 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE AND DO WHAT I COULD.

04:21:53.665 --> 04:21:58.670 region:rollup2
SO I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE.

04:21:55.667 --> 04:22:00.071 region:rollup2
MY SON IS NOW THIRTY SEVEN AND

04:21:58.670 --> 04:22:00.605 region:rollup2
WHEN HE WAS TWENTY ONE HE

04:22:00.071 --> 04:22:01.873 region:rollup2
SEPARATE A DRAMATIC BRAIN

04:22:00.605 --> 04:22:03.107 region:rollup2
INJURY.

04:22:01.873 --> 04:22:05.543 region:rollup2
HE WAS IN.

04:22:03.107 --> 04:22:06.678 region:rollup2
A REHAB FACILITY FOR NINE

04:22:05.543 --> 04:22:09.614 region:rollup2
MONTHS AND.

04:22:06.678 --> 04:22:11.716 region:rollup2
IT MADE PHENOMENAL PROGRESS.

04:22:09.614 --> 04:22:13.284 region:rollup2
WENT FROM WHAT THEY SAID WOULD

04:22:11.716 --> 04:22:14.886 region:rollup2
BE A VEGETABLE NEVER WALK NEVER

04:22:13.284 --> 04:22:16.721 region:rollup2
TALK NEVER DO ANYTHING TO BEING

04:22:14.886 --> 04:22:17.255 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY HIGH FUNCTIONING

04:22:16.721 --> 04:22:19.123 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

04:22:17.255 --> 04:22:20.658 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT ATTESTS TO THE

04:22:19.123 --> 04:22:22.760 region:rollup2
PLASTICITY OF THE BRAIN IN THE

04:22:20.658 --> 04:22:24.395 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE. TO

04:22:22.760 --> 04:22:26.698 region:rollup2
IN FACT MAKE PROGRESS.

04:22:24.395 --> 04:22:28.833 region:rollup2
IT WAS A NEW THEORY AT THE TIME

04:22:26.698 --> 04:22:29.801 region:rollup2
AND I LATCHED ONTO IT YOU CAN

04:22:28.833 --> 04:22:31.736 region:rollup2
BET THAT BLESSED IS THE OF THE

04:22:29.801 --> 04:22:33.438 region:rollup2
BRAIN. BUT ANYWAY HE.

04:22:31.736 --> 04:22:35.473 region:rollup2
AFTER NINE MONTHS HE CAME BACK

04:22:33.438 --> 04:22:37.675 region:rollup2
INTO THE COMMUNITY AND WE WANTED

04:22:35.473 --> 04:22:39.477 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE THE PROGRESS THAT HE

04:22:37.675 --> 04:22:42.013 region:rollup2
HAD MADE. AND.

04:22:39.477 --> 04:22:43.081 region:rollup2
WE REACHED OUT FOR SERVICES AND

04:22:42.013 --> 04:22:44.649 region:rollup2
THE SERVICES.

04:22:43.081 --> 04:22:45.550 region:rollup2
IN THE BEGINNING OF COURSE TO

04:22:44.649 --> 04:22:47.118 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE THEM INTO THE

04:22:45.550 --> 04:22:48.920 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND AND BECOME SELF

04:22:47.118 --> 04:22:51.256 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT WE LOOK FOR THE DAY

04:22:48.920 --> 04:22:53.725 region:rollup2
CARE PROGRAMS. AND THE DAYCARE

04:22:51.256 --> 04:22:56.661 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WOULD OF BEEN ABLE TO.

04:22:53.725 --> 04:22:58.363 region:rollup2
HELP HIM SET GOALS HELPING HAVE

04:22:56.661 --> 04:23:00.298 region:rollup2
FRIENDS BECAUSE ALL OF HIS OLD

04:22:58.363 --> 04:23:01.499 region:rollup2
FRIENDS WERE OF COURSE GONE AT

04:23:00.298 --> 04:23:04.135 region:rollup2
THIS POINT BUT.

04:23:01.499 --> 04:23:07.372 region:rollup2
IT TO SET GOALS AND TO.

04:23:04.135 --> 04:23:10.008 region:rollup2
TO DO BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION AND

04:23:07.372 --> 04:23:12.644 region:rollup2
TO LEARN TO SOCIALLY INTERACT

04:23:10.008 --> 04:23:13.611 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY AND ALL OF THOSE

04:23:12.644 --> 04:23:16.481 region:rollup2
ARE THE KINDS OF SKILLS WITH

04:23:13.611 --> 04:23:17.849 region:rollup2
TRAINED PEOPLE WHO COULD SUPPORT

04:23:16.481 --> 04:23:22.220 region:rollup2
HIM IN THIS JOURNEY AND WOOD

04:23:17.849 --> 04:23:22.754 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT IMAGE. AND HELP HIM

04:23:22.220 --> 04:23:23.388 region:rollup2
OF THIS WHOLE STAFF BUT.

04:23:22.754 --> 04:23:24.022 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE DAY PROGRAMS WERE

04:23:23.388 --> 04:23:24.656 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTER FUNDED AND WE

04:23:24.022 --> 04:23:25.023 region:rollup2
WERE NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER INTO

04:23:24.656 --> 04:23:25.723 region:rollup2
ANY OF THEM.

HERE AND A PARTICIPATED IN THE

04:24:54.579 --> 04:24:57.815 region:rollup2

WAS A FABULOUS PROGRAM AND SO

04:25:11.329 --> 04:25:13.865 region:rollup2
THEN WE HAD TO THE WORK

04:25:12.964 --> 04:25:17.502 region:rollup2
COMPONENT AND WE FOUND ANOTHER.

04:25:13.865 --> 04:25:19.570 region:rollup2
ALTA REGIONAL CENTER PROGRAM WHO

04:25:17.502 --> 04:25:21.239 region:rollup2
WAS WILLING TO JUST SOAK JOE

04:25:19.570 --> 04:25:23.541 region:rollup2
INTO THEIR PROGRAM AND THEY PUT

04:25:21.239 --> 04:25:25.510 region:rollup2
HIM ON A A WORK CREW WHERE HE

04:25:23.541 --> 04:25:27.011 region:rollup2
WAS A TAKING FROM BOX TO FLORIDA

04:25:25.510 --> 04:25:28.613 region:rollup2
A. DINING ROOM CHAIR IN

04:25:27.011 --> 04:25:30.948 region:rollup2
REBUILDING IT AND PUTTING IT

04:25:28.613 --> 04:25:31.849 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND HE WAS SO PROUD OF

04:25:30.948 --> 04:25:34.752 region:rollup2
DOING THAT HE WASN'T UP THE

04:25:31.849 --> 04:25:39.724 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY STANDARDS BUT. HE WAS

04:25:34.752 --> 04:25:40.391 region:rollup2
ON A WORK CREW IT DIDN'T COST

04:25:39.724 --> 04:25:41.025 region:rollup2
THEM REALLY ANYTHING TO TAKE ON.

04:25:40.391 --> 04:25:41.626 region:rollup2
ONE MORE PERSON TO WORK WITH

04:25:41.025 --> 04:25:42.293 region:rollup2
THEM AND HE WAS IN HEAVEN.

04:25:41.626 --> 04:25:43.761 region:rollup2
IN BEING ABLE TO WORK BUT THEN

04:25:42.293 --> 04:25:45.963 region:rollup2
THE OTHER COMPONENT OF LIVING IN

04:25:43.761 --> 04:25:47.999 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO SINCE I'M IN UKIAH IS

04:25:45.963 --> 04:25:50.635 region:rollup2
THE LIVING SITUATION AND I FOUND

04:25:47.999 --> 04:25:52.403 region:rollup2
OF. A RESIDENTIAL CARE THAT

04:25:50.635 --> 04:25:54.071 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TAUGHT HIM TO COOK

04:25:52.403 --> 04:25:55.273 region:rollup2
AND TELL HIM TO SHOP AND TAUGHT

04:25:54.071 --> 04:25:56.674 region:rollup2
HIM TO BE INDEPENDENT AND

04:25:55.273 --> 04:25:58.509 region:rollup2
SOCIALLY INTERACT WITH PEOPLE

04:25:56.674 --> 04:25:59.610 region:rollup2
AND STUFF. AND THEY WERE IT WAS

04:25:58.509 --> 04:26:01.779 region:rollup2
A REGIONAL CENTER.

04:25:59.610 --> 04:26:03.481 region:rollup2
THAT RESIDENTIAL AND THEY SAID

04:26:01.779 --> 04:26:05.316 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE THIS OTHER EXTRA

04:26:03.481 --> 04:26:06.284 region:rollup2
ROOM THAT WAS LIKE LIKE A CLOSET

04:26:05.316 --> 04:26:07.785 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BUT WE WERE WILLING TO

04:26:06.284 --> 04:26:10.321 region:rollup2
LIVE IN IT BUT THE REGIONAL

04:26:07.785 --> 04:26:11.956 region:rollup2
CENTER SAID. NO IF YOU PUT

04:26:10.321 --> 04:26:14.292 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY IN THERE THAT IS NOT A

04:26:11.956 --> 04:26:15.426 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTER CLIENT WE WILL

04:26:14.292 --> 04:26:17.195 region:rollup2
CANCEL YOUR VENDOR SHIP.

04:26:15.426 --> 04:26:18.863 region:rollup2
SO JOE LOST OUT ON THAT

04:26:17.195 --> 04:26:20.731 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS AND THE GATE PUT HIM

04:26:18.863 --> 04:26:20.932 region:rollup2
INTO ANOTHER RESIDENTIAL CARE

04:26:20.731 --> 04:26:22.567 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:26:20.932 --> 04:26:23.634 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT

04:26:22.567 --> 04:26:25.837 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE THE INTEREST THAT

04:26:23.634 --> 04:26:27.338 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE ANY OF GOALS OUR

04:26:25.837 --> 04:26:28.973 region:rollup2
DIRECTION AND JOE ENDED UP.

04:26:27.338 --> 04:26:30.374 region:rollup2
SMOKING TOO MUCH IN GETTING

04:26:28.973 --> 04:26:32.376 region:rollup2
SOME CIGARETTES AND HAVING A

04:26:30.374 --> 04:26:33.311 region:rollup2
SEIZURE AND HAD ANOTHER HEAD

04:26:32.376 --> 04:26:34.312 region:rollup2
INJURY AND SO I HAD TO BRING HIM

04:26:33.311 --> 04:26:36.347 region:rollup2
HOME.

04:26:34.312 --> 04:26:38.149 region:rollup2
SO WE STARTED OVER AGAIN IN

04:26:36.347 --> 04:26:39.617 region:rollup2
UKIAH HE WANTED TO.

04:26:38.149 --> 04:26:41.919 region:rollup2
TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY I MEAN

04:26:39.617 --> 04:26:43.254 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING WAS TO FOR HIS OWN

04:26:41.919 --> 04:26:45.356 region:rollup2
SELF ESTEEM AND TO BUILD

04:26:43.254 --> 04:26:47.158 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENCE WHAT WE WANTED WAS

04:26:45.356 --> 04:26:49.093 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENCE FOR HIM AND.

04:26:47.158 --> 04:26:50.962 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY I COULD REALLY DO

04:26:49.093 --> 04:26:52.697 region:rollup2
IT WAS I BECAME THE CASE MANAGER

04:26:50.962 --> 04:26:54.232 region:rollup2
I MANAGE THE STAFF I MANAGED

04:26:52.697 --> 04:26:55.933 region:rollup2

HEAD INJURIES IS NOT ALWAYS THE

04:27:33.571 --> 04:27:36.941 region:rollup2
CASE THAT CAN BE VERY NEGATIVE

04:27:35.006 --> 04:27:38.676 region:rollup2
AN ANGRY. BUT HE WAS POSITIVE HE

04:27:36.941 --> 04:27:40.645 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH JUST

04:27:38.676 --> 04:27:41.145 region:rollup2
WALKING INTO THE ROOM. AND HE'S

04:27:40.645 --> 04:27:42.980 region:rollup2
NOW DISCOURAGED

04:27:41.145 --> 04:27:44.882 region:rollup2
DEPRESSED

04:27:42.980 --> 04:27:46.350 region:rollup2
AT HOME AS WE SPEAK PUBLICLY ON

BE A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF OUR

04:27:52.223 --> 04:27:55.593 region:rollup2
SOCIETY WHICH IS WHAT HE WANTED

04:27:54.458 --> 04:27:56.460 region:rollup2
TO BE HE WANTED TO BE

04:27:55.593 --> 04:27:57.995 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT AND CERTAINLY.

04:27:56.460 --> 04:27:59.163 region:rollup2
.

04:27:57.995 --> 04:28:00.765 region:rollup2
ABLE TO BE PRODUCTIVE WE

04:27:59.163 --> 04:28:02.400 region:rollup2
ENVISION FOR AWHILE HIM BEING

04:28:00.765 --> 04:28:04.135 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GO TO THE HIGH SCHOOL

04:28:02.400 --> 04:28:05.937 region:rollup2
AND TALK TO HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS

04:28:04.135 --> 04:28:08.005 region:rollup2
ABOUT DRINKING AND DRIVING BUT.

04:28:05.937 --> 04:28:09.373 region:rollup2
THAT'S LIKE NOT EVEN VAGUELY ON

04:28:08.005 --> 04:28:10.741 region:rollup2
THE AGENDA AT THIS POINT YOU

04:28:09.373 --> 04:28:11.475 region:rollup2
KNOW BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE THE

04:28:10.741 --> 04:28:13.477 region:rollup2
SKILLS HE DOESN'T HAVE THE

04:28:11.475 --> 04:28:15.246 region:rollup2
ABILITY. AND MY CONTENTION IS

04:28:13.477 --> 04:28:17.582 region:rollup2
THAT IF HE WAS ON SUCH A ROLL

04:28:15.246 --> 04:28:19.116 region:rollup2
FROM THE REHAB IT THAT IN THE

04:28:17.582 --> 04:28:20.718 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WE COULD HAVE HAD

04:28:19.116 --> 04:28:22.987 region:rollup2
THOSE EARLY INTERVENTIONS THAT

04:28:20.718 --> 04:28:24.355 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTER PROVIDES. WHICH

04:28:22.987 --> 04:28:25.189 region:rollup2
REALLY WOULDN'T COST ALL THAT

04:28:24.355 --> 04:28:27.491 region:rollup2
MUCH BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:29.126 region:rollup2
PHENOMENAL FOR HIM HE COULD BE A

04:28:27.491 --> 04:28:30.461 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY

04:28:29.126 --> 04:28:32.897 region:rollup2
NOW HE COULD BE DOING.

04:28:30.461 --> 04:28:33.998 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTING POSITIVE THINGS AND

04:28:32.897 --> 04:28:35.466 region:rollup2
IT REQUIRES THAT EARLY

04:28:33.998 --> 04:28:37.735 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION AND THAT EARLY

04:28:35.466 --> 04:28:40.204 region:rollup2
SUPPORT AND IF WE DON'T HAVE

04:28:37.735 --> 04:28:41.205 region:rollup2
THAT THEN WE CAN'T HAVE THE

04:28:40.204 --> 04:28:43.441 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF OUR

04:28:41.205 --> 04:28:45.376 region:rollup2
SOCIETY AS THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE

04:28:43.441 --> 04:28:47.144 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD. ENCOURAGE YOU TO

04:28:45.376 --> 04:28:48.946 region:rollup2
THINK THAT MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE

04:28:47.144 --> 04:28:50.982 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE ON THE EARLY

04:28:48.946 --> 04:28:51.749 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION SIDE BUT SO MUCH OF

04:28:50.982 --> 04:28:52.683 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE INCORPORATED TO

04:28:51.749 --> 04:28:54.251 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY

THEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO HEAR FROM.

04:30:02.486 --> 04:30:06.123 region:rollup2

PRIMARY CONCERN WE HAVE A COUPLE

04:30:26.043 --> 04:30:29.113 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH HIS PROPOSED BUT

04:30:27.778 --> 04:30:32.083 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY ONE.

04:30:29.113 --> 04:30:34.318 region:rollup2
IS THAT WELL YOU CAN ESTIMATED

04:30:32.083 --> 04:30:36.020 region:rollup2
NUMBER FOR WHAT ANNUAL COSTS

04:30:34.318 --> 04:30:37.421 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE IT'S SUBJECTIVE BECAUSE

04:30:36.020 --> 04:30:38.756 region:rollup2
YOU COULD ESTIMATED A LOT OF

04:30:37.421 --> 04:30:40.725 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS.

04:30:38.756 --> 04:30:42.660 region:rollup2
THE CONCERN IS WHAT THE IMPACT

04:30:40.725 --> 04:30:44.995 region:rollup2
WOULD BE FOR OLDER CASES.

04:30:42.660 --> 04:30:46.664 region:rollup2
AS WAS NOTED IN THEIR ESTIMATE

04:30:44.995 --> 04:30:48.432 region:rollup2
THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE ALL THE

04:30:46.664 --> 04:30:50.067 region:rollup2
WAY TO PROJECT WHAT THOSE

04:30:48.432 --> 04:30:51.435 region:rollup2
NUMBERS MIGHT BE. IT'S AN

04:30:50.067 --> 04:30:54.972 region:rollup2
UNKNOWN.

04:30:51.435 --> 04:30:56.207 region:rollup2
THE CONCERN WE HAVE IS THAT.

04:30:54.972 --> 04:30:57.808 region:rollup2
THE SERVICE IS WHETHER SOME

04:30:56.207 --> 04:30:59.343 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN INTERSECTION OF

04:30:57.808 --> 04:31:00.978 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE TYPES OF SERVICES

04:30:59.343 --> 04:31:02.246 region:rollup2
THAT WE PROVIDE IN THE TYPES OF

04:31:00.978 --> 04:31:04.281 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

04:31:02.246 --> 04:31:05.649 region:rollup2
THAT INDIVIDUALS.

04:31:04.281 --> 04:31:07.551 region:rollup2
WITH ACQUIRED DRAMATIC BRAIN

04:31:05.649 --> 04:31:10.121 region:rollup2
INJURY MAY NEED.

04:31:07.551 --> 04:31:11.288 region:rollup2
I'M NOT ALL SERVICES

04:31:10.121 --> 04:31:11.889 region:rollup2
IT WE DON'T PROVIDE ALL THE

04:31:11.288 --> 04:31:16.594 region:rollup2
TYPES SO THIS COULD RESULT IN

04:31:11.889 --> 04:31:17.161 region:rollup2
THE

04:31:16.594 --> 04:31:19.396 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAVING TO DEVELOP

04:31:17.161 --> 04:31:21.265 region:rollup2
NEW.

04:31:19.396 --> 04:31:23.033 region:rollup2
MODELS OF SERVICE TARA FIND NEW

04:31:21.265 --> 04:31:24.201 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE THOSE

04:31:23.033 --> 04:31:26.804 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND.

04:31:24.201 --> 04:31:27.805 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE

04:31:26.804 --> 04:31:30.007 region:rollup2
COST OF DEVELOPING THOSE

04:31:27.805 --> 04:31:30.574 region:rollup2
SERVICES COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY

04:31:30.007 --> 04:31:32.443 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN WHAT'S PROJECTED

04:31:30.574 --> 04:31:36.614 region:rollup2
HERE.

04:31:32.443 --> 04:31:38.048 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELLIOTT.

04:31:36.614 --> 04:31:39.517 region:rollup2
AS SONYA PARTICULARLY HEALTH. I

04:31:38.048 --> 04:31:41.352 region:rollup2
AM I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT.

04:31:39.517 --> 04:31:43.687 region:rollup2
THE LA O. HAS BEEN WORKING WITH

04:31:41.352 --> 04:31:46.056 region:rollup2
THE SENATOR'S OFFICE ON REFINING

04:31:48.125 --> 04:31:51.262 region:rollup2
REQUESTS FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE.

04:31:49.727 --> 04:31:52.997 region:rollup2
OF THEIR WE THINK THERE ARE A

04:31:51.262 --> 04:31:56.033 region:rollup2
COUPLE AREAS WHERE THAT WE CAN

04:31:52.997 --> 04:31:56.534 region:rollup2
REFINE THAT ESTIMATE INCLUDING.

04:31:56.033 --> 04:31:58.936 region:rollup2
.

04:31:56.534 --> 04:32:00.738 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE AVERAGE COST FOR

04:31:58.936 --> 04:32:02.273 region:rollup2
ADULTS ARE CURRENTLY THAT

04:32:00.738 --> 04:32:04.775 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE IS SORT OF BASED ON ALL

04:32:02.273 --> 04:32:06.143 region:rollup2
AGES AND WE THINK THAT MIGHT

04:32:04.775 --> 04:32:07.645 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE ESTIMATE A BIT. HOW

04:32:06.143 --> 04:32:09.713 region:rollup2
WE ALSO NEED TO INCLUDE THE COST

04:32:07.645 --> 04:32:11.615 region:rollup2
OF REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS

04:32:09.713 --> 04:32:12.883 region:rollup2
INTO THE PER PERSON COST? AND

04:32:11.615 --> 04:32:13.484 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S THIS ISSUE OF

04:32:12.883 --> 04:32:15.953 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT.

04:32:13.484 --> 04:32:17.621 region:rollup2
THE OLDER ADULTS WHO MAY NOW BE

04:32:15.953 --> 04:32:19.924 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES BECAUSE

04:32:17.621 --> 04:32:21.792 region:rollup2
THEY HAD AN INJURY IN AGES

04:32:19.924 --> 04:32:23.761 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE. WE DO

04:32:21.792 --> 04:32:26.063 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

04:32:23.761 --> 04:32:28.599 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY

04:32:26.063 --> 04:32:30.367 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH A A RANGE OF OF

04:32:28.599 --> 04:32:32.303 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES FOR THIS AND WERE. WE

04:32:30.367 --> 04:32:33.637 region:rollup2
PLAN TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH

04:32:32.303 --> 04:32:34.672 region:rollup2
THE SENATOR'S OFFICE OVERTHE

04:32:33.637 --> 04:32:35.172 region:rollup2
NEXT COUPLE MONTHS.

04:32:34.672 --> 04:32:37.308 region:rollup2
TO COME UP WITH A BETTER

04:32:35.172 --> 04:32:38.375 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE.

04:32:37.308 --> 04:32:39.543 region:rollup2
WE WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT ALL

04:32:38.375 --> 04:32:40.911 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO AGREE WITH THE

04:32:39.543 --> 04:32:42.146 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF THAT.

04:32:40.911 --> 04:32:44.381 region:rollup2
.

04:32:42.146 --> 04:32:47.184 region:rollup2
CERTAIN SERVICES MAY NEED TO BE

04:32:44.381 --> 04:32:48.586 region:rollup2
EXPANDED OR DEVELOPED.

04:32:47.184 --> 04:32:50.120 region:rollup2
BUT WE WOULD NOT THAT THE

04:32:48.586 --> 04:32:51.889 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY.

04:32:50.120 --> 04:32:53.257 region:rollup2
BUT DOES SERVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

04:32:51.889 --> 04:32:54.959 region:rollup2
SUFFERED FROM TRAUMATIC BRAIN

04:32:53.257 --> 04:32:56.227 region:rollup2
INJURIES IF THEY ACQUIRED THE

04:32:54.959 --> 04:32:57.628 region:rollup2
INJURY WHEN THEY WERE SEVENTEEN

04:32:56.227 --> 04:32:59.563 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE.

04:32:57.628 --> 04:33:01.065 region:rollup2
SO IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT

04:32:59.563 --> 04:33:03.634 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE WOULD WOULD NEED TO BE

04:33:01.065 --> 04:33:05.970 region:rollup2
EXPANDED AND SERVICES EXPANDED

04:33:03.634 --> 04:33:06.270 region:rollup2

IS DEBATE TO FAMILIES WHO ASKED

FAMILIES WHO SPOKE TO THAT

04:39:13.236 --> 04:39:16.440 region:rollup2
AUDIENCE OF FIVE THOUSAND.

04:39:15.238 --> 04:39:17.708 region:rollup2

RESOURCES THAT THE STATE HAS.

04:39:30.954 --> 04:39:33.190 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS GOING

04:39:32.089 --> 04:39:34.992 region:rollup2
TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR US IT

04:39:33.190 --> 04:39:36.526 region:rollup2

TONIGHT. AND THIS IS ANOTHER

04:49:05.695 --> 04:49:09.532 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT SOME OF

THOSE PAINFUL CHOICES WE HAD TO

04:49:09.532 --> 04:49:14.103 region:rollup2
MAKE DURING THE RECESSION.

04:49:11.534 --> 04:49:15.772 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME. THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:49:14.103 --> 04:49:17.140 region:rollup2

04:49:15.772 --> 04:49:18.474 region:rollup2
WITH MAKING SIGNIFICANT CUT

04:49:17.140 --> 04:49:20.243 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER

04:49:18.474 --> 04:49:20.743 region:rollup2
PROCESS ABOUT HOW BEST TO

04:49:20.243 --> 04:49:22.512 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THOSE CUTS WHILE

04:49:20.743 --> 04:49:24.347 region:rollup2

INDIVIDUALS THAT THE REGIONAL

CENTERS WERE SUPPORTING. AND A

04:49:27.984 --> 04:49:32.155 region:rollup2
PAINFUL CHOICE WAS MADE THE CUT

FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES.

04:49:32.155 --> 04:49:35.291 region:rollup2

PROGRAM THE STATE IS NO LONGER

04:49:41.698 --> 04:49:45.168 region:rollup2
NO PATH FORWARD.

04:49:43.833 --> 04:49:47.003 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE

04:49:45.168 --> 04:49:48.238 region:rollup2
MISSION OF REGIONAL CENTERS IS

04:49:47.003 --> 04:49:50.640 region:rollup2

04:50:04.721 --> 04:50:07.390 region:rollup2
PIECE WHICH ALLOWS REGIONAL

CENTERS TO COMPLETE THEIR

04:50:07.390 --> 04:50:11.127 region:rollup2
HOLISTIC APPROACH TO THIS

04:50:08.725 --> 04:50:14.364 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

04:50:11.127 --> 04:50:15.431 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT INCLUSION.

04:50:14.364 --> 04:50:17.867 region:rollup2

ASK REALLY WHAT IS THAT.

04:50:21.571 --> 04:50:25.141 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL DON'T GOVERNMENT

GIVES US A FANTASTIC DEFINITION

04:50:25.141 --> 04:50:29.379 region:rollup2
AND IT TELLS US THAT WE NEED TO

04:50:26.976 --> 04:50:31.347 region:rollup2
BALANCE.

04:50:29.379 --> 04:50:33.316 region:rollup2

PARTICIPATE IN OUR COMMUNITY.

04:50:54.270 --> 04:50:58.408 region:rollup2
SOCIAL RECKON CAN'T REALLY

PEOPLE TO TAKE SKILLS THAT

04:51:00.476 --> 04:51:04.013 region:rollup2
THEY'RE LEARNING. AND TO APPLY

04:51:04.013 --> 04:51:07.216 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL AND SUCCESSFUL FOR

04:51:06.115 --> 04:51:08.217 region:rollup2
THEM.

04:51:07.216 --> 04:51:10.520 region:rollup2
IT BRINGS IMMEASURABLE VALUE TO

04:51:08.217 --> 04:51:12.855 region:rollup2
THEIR LIVES.

04:51:10.520 --> 04:51:14.090 region:rollup2
AND IT AFFORDS THEM THE SAME

04:51:12.855 --> 04:51:15.825 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES THAT PEOPLE

04:51:14.090 --> 04:51:17.760 region:rollup2
WITHOUT DISABILITIES ENJOY.

04:51:15.825 --> 04:51:21.030 region:rollup2

04:51:17.760 --> 04:51:22.732 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL HERE FOR.

04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:24.901 region:rollup2

04:51:36.779 --> 04:51:39.983 region:rollup2
SORT OF A SENSE OF EQUITY IT'S

04:51:38.414 --> 04:51:41.818 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE PEOPLE

04:51:39.983 --> 04:51:44.620 region:rollup2

COMMUNITIES VALUE. AND WE NEED
