THANK YOU. THE MORNING CARE I UNITS THROW WITH THE L. A. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONCERNS THAT THE PROPOSAL AT SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION TO REQUEST MAKES UP ABOUT 8% OF THE KERRY FACT FUNDING THE STATE HAS RECEIVED FOR A SMALLER AND MORE RURAL TRANSIT AGENCIES AND WE FIND THAT THE REQUEST IS REASONABLE GIVEN THE NEED TO THE TRANSIT AGENCY TO COLLECT VERY SAFELY DURING THE PAST THAT MAX.
