UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. THEY

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.015
HAVE TO SIGN THAT THESE ARE

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:48.883
INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD BE

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:50.084

WILL BE WILL- A 100% A

01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:59.961
MISPRINT. THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:30:00.027 --> 01:30:02.497
FORGIVE THAT. AND UNDER THE

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:04.599
PRIOR EVICTION PROTECTION LAWS

01:30:04.665 --> 01:30:05.266
IN THE PAST WE'VE MADE IT MUCH

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:07.235
EASIER. AND MUCH MORE

01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:08.703
INEXPENSIVE FOR LANDLORDS TO

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.171

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:11.539

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:24.352
THE AMOUNT. ONCE THAT JUDGMENT

01:30:24.418 --> 01:30:26.387
IS ISSUED A TENANTS WAGES COULD

01:30:26.454 --> 01:30:28.656
BE GARNISHED AND FUNDS

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:29.190
WITHDRAWN FROM THEIR BANK

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:31.159
ACCOUNTS. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:32.627
SOME SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW IF

01:30:32.693 --> 01:30:33.694
A TENANT LEAVES IN THE DEAD OF

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:35.596
NIGHT. LANDLORDS WILL GET PAID

01:30:35.663 --> 01:30:37.732
WELL UNDER THIS BILL. AT THE

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:38.566

TO GET PAID DIRECTLY A LANDLORD

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:45.773
CAN INITIATE THE APPLICATION. I

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.275
KNOW WE'VE HEARD FROM ANOTHER

01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:48.209
COLLEAGUES WHO IS ASKING

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:49.310
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF

01:30:49.377 --> 01:30:51.379
OVERSIGHT THERE IS. ABOUT THE

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:52.880
FACT THAT WE'VE HAD SLOW

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:55.483
DISBURSEMENT OF RENTAL FUNDS

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:57.251
THUS FAR LET ME SAY I DON'T

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:58.553
THINK THERE'S ANYONE ON THIS

01:30:58.619 --> 01:30:59.921
CHAMBER. WHO HAS NOT BEEN

01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:01.389
FRUSTRATED AT HOW LONG IT'S

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:03.324
TAKEN TO GET THIS MONEY OUT.

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:04.659
BUT THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR

01:31:04.725 --> 01:31:06.794
THE SLOW DISBURSEMENT THUS FAR.

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:08.930
THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM. IT WAS

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:10.364
JUST SET UP AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:11.132
A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN AT THE

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:12.733
LOCAL LEVELS. IN MANY

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.468
JURISDICTIONS THEY'VE JUST

01:31:14.535 --> 01:31:15.903
STARTED IN THE LAST MONTH TO

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:17.805
GET MONEY OUT. THEY'RE BEEN

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:20.174
VERY COMPLICATED AND CHANGING

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:20.675
FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:22.176
REQUIREMENTS. THE

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:23.211
ADMINISTRATION THESE PROGRAMS

01:31:23.277 --> 01:31:24.145
HAVE BEEN HAMPERED BY

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:25.913
CHALLENGES IN EDUCATING.

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:26.848
MILLIONS OF TENANTS AND

GOVERNOR'S MAIN SPOKESMAN ON

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:02.229
THE ISSUE THE CENTER FOR ORINDA

01:45:02.295 --> 01:45:04.297
HAS SAID SO DIRECTLY HE SAID

01:45:04.364 --> 01:45:06.199
BEST OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT THIS

01:45:06.266 --> 01:45:08.468
RECKLESS RECALL OF GAVIN

01:45:08.535 --> 01:45:09.036
NEWSOM. IS TO HAVE AN EARLY

01:45:09.102 --> 01:45:11.471
ELECTION. HE SAID GAVIN NEWSOM

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:13.040
SHOULD FIGHT THE BATTLE ON HIS

01:45:13.106 --> 01:45:16.543
TERMS. HE SAID HE SHOULD STRIKE

01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:17.944
WHILE HIS FAVORABLES ARE STRONG

01:45:18.011 --> 01:45:20.580
ENOUGH. THE CENTER WENT ON

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:21.782
TELEVISION AND SAID IN MY

01:45:21.848 --> 01:45:23.684
CALCULATION THERE'S A LOT OF

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:24.951
UNKNOWNS OUT THERE THAT COULD

01:45:25.018 --> 01:45:27.120
CHANGE THE POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT

01:45:27.187 --> 01:45:29.423
THAT WE'VE SEEN ON HIS BEHALF.

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:30.957
HE CONTINUED THAT DRIVES MY

01:45:31.024 --> 01:45:33.126
POLITICAL ADVICE THE NO ACTION

01:45:33.193 --> 01:45:36.029
SOONER UNDER THE LAW WOULD BE A

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:38.565
BETTER CIRCUMSTANCE FOR. BUT

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:39.299
THE SENATOR GOT AHEAD OF

01:45:39.366 --> 01:45:41.802
HIMSELF. BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT

01:45:41.868 --> 01:45:42.803
THAT THE LAW THAT IS THE

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:45.772
CORRUPT ONE PASSED IN TWENTY

01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:47.607
SEVENTEEN DIDN'T ALLOW FOR THE

01:45:47.674 --> 01:45:49.509
ELECTION TO HAPPEN AS EARLY AS

01:45:49.576 --> 01:45:51.745
HE SUGGESTING. SO THE

01:45:51.812 --> 01:45:53.680
GOVERNOR'S TEAM SAID NO PROBLEM

01:45:53.747 --> 01:45:55.949
WE'LL JUST CHANGE THE LAW IN

01:45:56.016 --> 01:45:58.151
ORDER TO HAVE THE ELECTION WHEN

01:45:58.218 --> 01:45:59.753
WE THINK IT'LL GIVE US THE BEST

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:02.355
CHANCE. TO WIN. IT IS NOT

01:46:02.422 --> 01:46:04.758
HYPERBOLE TO SAY THIS IS

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:06.793
QUALITATIVELY THE SAME THING

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.463
THAT HAPPENS IN CORRUPT SHAM

01:46:09.529 --> 01:46:11.631
DEMOCRACIES THE WORLD OVER.

01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:14.668
THOSE IN POWER USED THEIR POWER

01:46:14.735 --> 01:46:16.403
TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T LOSE

01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:18.805
THEIR POWER. THEIR

03:51:30.376 --> 03:51:32.378
THAT HAS A GROWING BACKLOG WITH

03:51:32.445 --> 03:51:35.915
OVER ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS

03:51:35.982 --> 03:51:36.682
STILL TRAPPED IN ITS

03:51:36.749 --> 03:51:38.718
BUREAUCRACY. IT DOES NOT PAY

03:51:38.784 --> 03:51:40.086
DOWN THE MOUNTING UNEMPLOYMENT

03:51:40.152 --> 03:51:42.188
INSURANCE FUND DEBT NOT ONE

03:51:42.255 --> 03:51:45.691
DOLLAR. AGAIN NOT ONE DOLLAR IS

03:51:45.758 --> 03:51:47.526
IN THIS BUDGET FRAMEWORK THAT

03:51:47.593 --> 03:51:49.262
DEALS WITH THIS THAT. THE

03:51:49.328 --> 03:51:50.796
BIGGER THIS THAT GETS THE

03:51:50.863 --> 03:51:52.198
HIGHER THE TAXES WILL GET FOR

03:51:52.265 --> 03:51:54.867
BUSINESS IS STILL STRUGGLING ON

03:51:54.934 --> 03:51:56.335
THE HILL THE ON THE HEELS OF

03:51:56.402 --> 03:51:58.804
THIS PANDEMIC A DEBT THAT WAS

03:51:58.871 --> 03:52:00.706
INCURRED BECAUSE OF STATE

03:52:00.773 --> 03:52:03.142
MISMANAGEMENT. BY CONTINUING TO

03:52:03.209 --> 03:52:05.044
DEPRIVE OUR SMALL BUSINESSES

03:52:05.111 --> 03:52:06.912
SUBSTANTIAL SUBSTANTIAL RELIEF

03:52:06.979 --> 03:52:08.614
THE STATE IS INCREASING AN

03:52:08.681 --> 03:52:10.983
ALREADY HIGH TAX BURDEN IN

03:52:11.050 --> 03:52:11.884
STIFLING THEIR ABILITY TO

03:52:11.951 --> 03:52:14.353
RECOVER. ALREADY PERSEVERING

03:52:14.420 --> 03:52:16.289
THROUGH UNCERTAINTY FAILING TO

03:52:16.355 --> 03:52:18.090
ACT ON THIS CRITICAL PRIORITY

03:52:18.157 --> 03:52:20.159
IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. THIS

03:52:20.226 --> 03:52:21.794
BILL DOES NOT REPAY THE SEVEN

03:52:21.861 --> 03:52:24.697
POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS

03:52:24.764 --> 03:52:25.331
THAT WAS TAKEN AT THE RAINY DAY

03:52:25.398 --> 03:52:28.968
FUND. WE ALL AGREE MORE SAVINGS

03:52:29.035 --> 03:52:29.502
IS BETTER THAN SIMPLY MORE

03:52:29.568 --> 03:52:32.204
SPENDING. EVEN MORE CONCERNING

03:52:32.271 --> 03:52:34.307
IS THE INSUFFICIENT FUNDING TO

03:52:34.373 --> 03:52:35.975
FIGHT WILDFIRES IN BRING RELIEF

03:52:36.042 --> 03:52:37.910
TO THIS EXTREME DROUGHT.

03:52:37.977 --> 03:52:40.613
WILDFIRE AND DROUGHT OR DUAL

03:52:40.680 --> 03:52:42.848
THREATS THAT FACE CALIFORNIA

03:52:42.915 --> 03:52:45.518
RIGHT NOW A WILDFIRE PREVENTION

03:52:45.584 --> 03:52:48.054
THE RHETORIC ISN'T MATCHING THE

03:52:48.120 --> 03:52:49.722
REALITY AS IT APPEARS THAT

03:52:49.789 --> 03:52:51.023
THERE IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT

03:52:51.090 --> 03:52:52.658
COMMITMENT TO WILDFIRE

03:52:52.725 --> 03:52:53.759
PREVENTION FOR THIS UPCOMING

03:52:53.826 --> 03:52:55.461
BUDGET YEAR. WE NOT ONLY NEED

03:52:55.528 --> 03:52:58.431
CERTAINTY BUT SUSTAINED FUNDING

03:52:58.497 --> 03:53:01.100
RIGHT NOW WITH THE MERE HOPE OF

03:53:01.167 --> 03:53:01.667
MORE ACTION THE FUTURE IS

03:53:01.734 --> 03:53:03.602
UNACCEPTABLE IN FACT THERE'S A

03:53:03.669 --> 03:53:06.305
FIRE BURNING IN KERN COUNTY AT

03:53:06.372 --> 03:53:07.606
THIS VERY MOMENT. WATER

03:53:07.673 --> 03:53:09.542
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WATER

03:53:09.608 --> 03:53:11.744
STORAGE MUST BE PART OF ANY

03:53:11.811 --> 03:53:14.413
LONG TERM JOB SOLUTION. AGAIN

03:53:14.480 --> 03:53:15.848
THE DETAILS IN THIS AGREEMENT

03:53:15.915 --> 03:53:18.551
STILL REMAIN LACKING. WE IN THE

03:53:18.617 --> 03:53:19.685
CENTRAL VALLEY ARE SEEING THE

03:53:19.752 --> 03:53:22.588
HUMAN AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF

03:53:22.655 --> 03:53:24.690
OUR STATE'S FAILURE TO INVEST

03:53:24.757 --> 03:53:27.593
IN WATER STORAGE YEARS AGO. WE

03:53:27.660 --> 03:53:28.327
NEED STORAGE AND CONVEYANCE

03:53:28.394 --> 03:53:30.429
IMPROVEMENTS TO ENSURE A

03:53:30.496 --> 03:53:32.732
SUSTAINABLE AND RELIABLE WATER

03:53:32.798 --> 03:53:36.302
SUPPLY FOR AND OUR ENTIRE STATE.

03:53:36.369 --> 03:53:37.703
I'M AFRAID THAT THIS WILL BE

03:53:37.770 --> 03:53:40.973
ANOTHER MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO

03:53:41.040 --> 03:53:41.507
ADDRESS THESE GROWING AND

03:53:41.574 --> 03:53:43.309
LOOMING THREATS. CALIFORNIANS

03:53:43.376 --> 03:53:45.411
ARE FACING AN AFFORDABILITY

03:53:45.478 --> 03:53:47.413
CRISIS IT'S UNDENIABLE IN

03:53:47.480 --> 03:53:49.382
CALIFORNIANS AND BUSINESSES ARE

03:53:49.448 --> 03:53:51.384
LEAVING OUR STATE. THAT'S

03:53:51.450 --> 03:53:53.953
RESTORE PERMANENTLY THE TAX

03:53:54.019 --> 03:53:55.855
RELIEF THAT IS NEEDED THAT WILL

03:53:55.921 --> 03:53:57.189
HELP OUR ECONOMY AND MAKE OUR

03:53:57.256 --> 03:53:59.158
STATE MORE COMPETITIVE TO OTHER

03:53:59.225 --> 03:54:01.961
STATES. NOW IS THE TIME TO PLAN

03:54:02.027 --> 03:54:03.496
RESPONSIBLY TO BUILD UP OUR

03:54:03.562 --> 03:54:05.598
RESERVES ARE REDUCING THE

03:54:05.664 --> 03:54:06.465
BURDENS ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND

03:54:06.532 --> 03:54:08.501
FAMILIES. THE NEED FOR WILDFIRE

03:54:08.567 --> 03:54:10.403
PREVENTION WATER STORAGE AND

03:54:10.469 --> 03:54:12.538
PERMANENT TAX RELIEF OR JUST AS

03:54:12.605 --> 03:54:14.240
URGENT NOW AS THEY WERE TWO

03:54:14.306 --> 03:54:16.242
WEEKS AGO AND EVEN TWO YEARS

03:54:16.308 --> 03:54:18.444
AGO AND CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL

03:54:18.511 --> 03:54:20.579
SUFFERING UNDER MISMANAGEMENT

03:54:20.646 --> 03:54:22.114
IN OUR STATE AGENCIES THAT

03:54:22.181 --> 03:54:24.250
CONTINUE TO FAIL THEM. AS I

03:54:24.316 --> 03:54:26.685
SAID TWO WEEKS AGO LOOKS CAN BE

03:54:26.752 --> 03:54:29.054
DECEIVING. POURING BILLIONS OF

03:54:29.121 --> 03:54:31.424
DOLLARS INTO BROKEN SYSTEMS

03:54:31.490 --> 03:54:33.592
IT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. OUR

03:54:33.659 --> 03:54:35.060
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE PLEADING

03:54:35.127 --> 03:54:36.729
FOR RELIEF THAT THIS BUDGET

03:54:36.796 --> 03:54:38.497
DOESN'T PROVIDE WE NEED TO

03:54:38.564 --> 03:54:40.199
DEVELOP A SIGNIFICANT AND

03:54:40.266 --> 03:54:41.233
SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS AND

03:54:41.300 --> 03:54:42.568
WHILE FOR PREVENTION AND WATER

03:54:42.635 --> 03:54:45.337
STORAGE WHICH THE DETAILS STILL

03:54:45.404 --> 03:54:47.706
ARE ARE NOT THERE. THIS BUDGET

03:54:47.773 --> 03:54:48.941
ADMITTEDLY IS STILL A WORK IN

03:54:49.008 --> 03:54:51.210
PROGRESS BUT I'M AFRAID THAT

03:54:51.277 --> 03:54:53.078
THIS BUDGET IS NOT ADEQUATE

03:54:53.145 --> 03:54:53.979
TACKLING CRITICAL AND

03:54:54.046 --> 03:54:55.781
FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS. EVERY

03:54:55.848 --> 03:54:57.550
CALIFORNIAN EXPECTS US TO

03:54:57.616 --> 03:55:00.786
TACKLE MEMBERS I URGE A NO VOTE

03:55:00.853 --> 03:55:04.290
ON SB ONE TWENTY NINE. THANK

03:55:04.356 --> 03:55:06.659
YOU MR FONG MR KILEY. YOUR

03:55:06.725 --> 03:55:10.796
RECORD LAST. THANK YOU MISTER

03:55:10.863 --> 03:55:12.398
SPEAKER- WE CONSIDER THIS

03:55:12.465 --> 03:55:13.799
BUDGET AT A MOMENT WHEN

03:55:13.866 --> 03:55:15.868
CALIFORNIA LAGS BEHIND THE REST

03:55:15.935 --> 03:55:17.770
OF THE NATION- IN ALMOST EVERY

03:55:17.837 --> 03:55:20.005
WAY NOT BECAUSE OF A VIRUS

03:55:20.072 --> 03:55:21.273
WHICH HIT EVERY STATE BUT

03:55:21.340 --> 03:55:22.708
BECAUSE OF OUR GOVERNMENT'S

03:55:22.775 --> 03:55:25.578
RESPONSE. FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN

03:55:25.644 --> 03:55:27.279
MONTHS CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A

03:55:27.346 --> 03:55:29.682
NATIONAL OUT WIRE AND ALL THE

03:55:29.748 --> 03:55:31.550
WORST WAYS. WE'VE GOT A LONGER

03:55:31.617 --> 03:55:33.219
SCHOOL CLOSURES THE MOST

03:55:33.285 --> 03:55:35.955
PUNISHING LOCKDOWNS AND THE

03:55:36.021 --> 03:55:36.489
NATION'S WORST PERFORMING

03:55:36.555 --> 03:55:38.491
BUREAUCRACY. AND THE RESULTS

03:55:38.557 --> 03:55:40.226
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES

03:55:40.292 --> 03:55:41.527
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS IN OUR SCHOOLS

03:55:41.594 --> 03:55:43.729
HAVE EXPLODED. OUR UNEMPLOYMENT

03:55:43.796 --> 03:55:45.331
RATE HAS BEEN CLOSE TO THE

03:55:45.397 --> 03:55:48.000
WORST IN THE COUNTRY. WHEN IT

03:55:48.067 --> 03:55:49.935
COMES TO UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS

03:55:50.002 --> 03:55:52.137
BOTH THE BACKLOG OF UNRESOLVED

03:55:52.204 --> 03:55:54.073
CLAIMS AND THE SCALE OF

03:55:54.139 --> 03:55:56.041
FRAUDULENT CLAIMS IS

03:55:56.108 --> 03:55:58.143
UNSURPASSED END. OUR PUBLIC

03:55:58.210 --> 03:55:59.645
HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE AMONG THE

03:55:59.712 --> 03:56:00.880
WORST IN THE COUNTRY WITH AN

03:56:00.946 --> 03:56:03.616
EXCESS MORTALITY RATE HIGHER

03:56:03.682 --> 03:56:06.886
THAN FORTY FOUR STATES. WITH

03:56:06.952 --> 03:56:08.420
THIS UNDER PERFORMANCE ISN'T

03:56:08.487 --> 03:56:11.557
JUST A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS

03:56:11.624 --> 03:56:13.492
IT CONTINUES INTO THE PRESENT

03:56:13.559 --> 03:56:15.828
WITH AMONG THE NATION'S WEAKEST

03:56:15.895 --> 03:56:18.898
ECONOMIC RECOVERIES. ABOUT HALF

03:56:18.964 --> 03:56:21.267
OF THE JOBS THAT WERE LOST HAVE

03:56:21.333 --> 03:56:23.569
BEEN RECOVERED AYE MERE HALF.

03:56:23.636 --> 03:56:24.670
SMALL BUSINESS OPENINGS ARE

03:56:24.737 --> 03:56:26.605
DOWN 40% OF THOSE SMALL

03:56:26.672 --> 03:56:29.008
BUSINESSES THAT REMAIN OPEN 40%

03:56:29.074 --> 03:56:31.310
ARE UNDERSTAFFED. THIS LAST

03:56:31.377 --> 03:56:33.045
MONTH WE ADDED JUST TWELVE

03:56:33.112 --> 03:56:35.781
THOUSAND WORKERS. NOW PART OF

03:56:35.848 --> 03:56:37.950
THE PROBLEM IS THE STATE IS IT

03:56:38.017 --> 03:56:40.719
RATIONALLY CLINGING TO A

03:56:40.786 --> 03:56:43.789
PANDEMIC MENTALITY. WE REFUSED

03:56:43.856 --> 03:56:45.824
AND OUR STATE OF EMERGENCY EVEN

03:56:45.891 --> 03:56:47.393
THOUGH THE STATE OF NEW YORK

03:56:47.459 --> 03:56:49.495
FOR EXAMPLE HAS. WE'RE STILL

03:56:49.562 --> 03:56:51.697
WEARING FEES EVEN THOUGH DOCTOR

03:56:51.764 --> 03:56:53.933
FOUND G. HIMSELF IS TESTIFYING

03:56:53.999 --> 03:56:56.168
IN CONGRESS WITHOUT ONE. I'M

03:56:56.235 --> 03:56:56.702
NOT SURE WHAT MESSAGE THAT

03:56:56.769 --> 03:56:59.805
SENDS. BUT THE OTHER PART OF

03:56:59.872 --> 03:57:03.208
THE PROBLEM. IS THAT WE HAVE

03:57:03.275 --> 03:57:05.778
BEEN PLANNING FOR FAILURE. IN

03:57:05.844 --> 03:57:07.513
THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET

03:57:07.580 --> 03:57:09.515
PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:57:09.582 --> 03:57:11.584
FINANCE ESTIMATED THAT

03:57:11.650 --> 03:57:12.952
UNEMPLOYMENT WOULD BE EIGHT

03:57:13.018 --> 03:57:16.221
POINT 5% FOR THIS ENTIRE YEAR.

03:57:16.288 --> 03:57:18.057
AT THE TIME SOME STATES ALREADY

03:57:18.123 --> 03:57:18.958
HAD AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HALF

03:57:19.024 --> 03:57:20.926
OF THAT. AND OUR DEPARTMENT OF

03:57:20.993 --> 03:57:22.494
FINANCE WAS SAYING EIGHT POINT

03:57:22.561 --> 03:57:24.263
5% FOR THE YEAR IN THE SAME

03:57:24.330 --> 03:57:26.865
DOCUMENT. IT FORECAST THAT

03:57:26.932 --> 03:57:28.334
UNEMPLOYMENT WOULD NOT RETURN

03:57:28.400 --> 03:57:31.036
TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS INTO THE

03:57:31.103 --> 03:57:32.304
TWO TILL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY

03:57:32.371 --> 03:57:35.107
FIVE. A FIVE YEAR RECOVERY. SO

03:57:35.174 --> 03:57:37.409
THAT IS THE ECONOMIC CONTEXT

03:57:37.476 --> 03:57:40.613
FOR TODAY'S BUDGET. IS ECONOMIC

03:57:40.679 --> 03:57:42.881
MALAISE THAT WAS CONSCIOUSLY

03:57:42.948 --> 03:57:45.517
PLANNED AND IS BEING NEEDLESSLY

03:57:45.584 --> 03:57:48.253
PERPETUATED. SO I WANT TO GIVE

03:57:48.320 --> 03:57:50.122
YOU A DESCRIPTION OF THE BUDGET

03:57:50.189 --> 03:57:51.991
IN THE GOVERNOR'S OWN WORDS

03:57:52.057 --> 03:57:54.627
HERE'S HOW HE DESCRIBES THIS

03:57:54.693 --> 03:57:56.028
CALIFORNIA COMEBACK PLANHE

03:57:56.095 --> 03:57:57.997

WILDFIRES I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

03:58:12.511 --> 03:58:14.847
WHAT THAT IS BUT IT'S NOT

03:58:14.913 --> 03:58:17.549
GOVERNING. IT'S NOT LEADERSHIP

03:58:17.616 --> 03:58:18.150
AND YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE MY

03:58:18.217 --> 03:58:20.686
WORD FOR THAT. LISTEN TO THE

03:58:20.753 --> 03:58:22.788
GOVERNOR'S OWN MENTAL HEALTH

03:58:22.855 --> 03:58:25.224
CZAR. WHO SAID THAT THE PROBLEM

03:58:25.290 --> 03:58:26.291
WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESS IT'S

03:58:26.358 --> 03:58:28.127
NOT A MONEY PROBLEM. IT'S A

03:58:28.193 --> 03:58:29.962
LEADERSHIP PROBLEM YEAH HERE WE

03:58:30.029 --> 03:58:31.096
ARE THROWING TWELVE BILLION

03:58:31.163 --> 03:58:32.798
DOLLARS MORE AT IT. WITHOUT

03:58:32.865 --> 03:58:34.199
ACTUALLY FINDING ANY REAL

03:58:34.266 --> 03:58:36.502
SOLUTIONS. REAL POLITICAL

03:58:36.568 --> 03:58:39.371
LEADERSHIP WOULD SEEK TO GET

03:58:39.438 --> 03:58:41.507
OUR ECONOMY BACK AT FULL TILT

03:58:41.573 --> 03:58:43.542
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WHILE

03:58:43.609 --> 03:58:46.278
PROVIDING A FOUNDATION FOR A
