To our with us here today to. Serve as panelists as a temp stand the complexities or mental health care fund our state. This will be again today when he- we're not. The proposition. Sixty three and the of mental health funding in California. Mental health please enter a plea is the lives of every one in ours. People's ability to function and carry out their normal activities in life. They are often compounded by stigma making it hard for people to talk openly about their experiences and this is particularly true for communities of color. The one in six Californians experience some mental illness. Not only do a sixth of California. And some mental illness but one every twenty four has a mental illness so serious it becomes difficult for them to function in daily. Individuals with. Mental illness have life expectancies twenty five shorter than the average population. Twenty five years shorter mental health issues prevent men of health issues it is the leading more towards. The other social determinants of health we know so well office. Hold and people are struggling to get. Increased substance abuse addiction. And oversee the stats and alarming in in. We never get worse is invested in both can and will help treatment approximately thirteen and a half million Californians are currently enrolled in medical program which guarantees mental health care to those who need it. Moreover only six to seven of California's. Population lacks health insurance any kind. Of mental health laws have adopted federal and- to ensure we invest hundreds of millions of dollars of mental health services act dollars in prevention and early intervention however even with such significant investments major issues exist. With the current. I'll be highlighted I. Believe that we need to tackle our current mental health crisis. To bring most advanced forms of care to scale across the state. We need the political will necessary to elevate brain illness as a top tier priority. Today. Based mental health system. Since well and where the system can improve I am eager to learn from our parts on the ways in which we can work towards achieving together just and equitable mental health care fund estimates. In this hearing will explore. Three and successes and its challenges prevention and early intervention we will revisit prop sixty three in specifically discussed and outcomes based model. And finally and certainly not least we will hear a presentation on the California advancing in innovating medi cal cal Azeem a multi year initiative by the age the us. Improve the quality of life. Some of our population without further ado I'd like to welcome our first panel. We use how. And I'm always. Be respectful his time in his work in offering the mental health service act. Start with Gerald on. For holding this hearing I. You just percent grateful I am out where they just later will. This to me yes. Yeah because it it takes if we're going to make the changes. That are necessary to help more more people so thank you. I. We are able my take it's a- minutes with bring the. Okay in give you did which is actually in line with. I have read in preparation your preparation for this hearing you know we always talk about the negative around mental health and about the history of the system right the closure the hospitals the failure to follow through and follow up on. Finding a decent system a community. I want to tell you a good story. Yeah yes nice store back in nineteen ninety eight. Junior family member spent a lot of time in this room my first year I introduce. Was built as a legislator eight thirty five. It was the integrated services for the homeless mentally ill I thought I could get three hundred fifty million dollars and I declared victory at the end the year one. And we got ten million dollars to start. I lit projects in Stanislaus county secretary I mean LA cam. Showing that if we did as the right kind of out read and write. Services for the homeless mentally ill we- not. Get cycle beginning. Then department of mental health and doctor Steve may Berg worked with this county is an all day colder's to actually produce publicly understood outcomes that if the shock the legislature they sure made them a very happy because they demonstrated significant reductions in. In business looking at the end jewel's year before entering services and the nine months or so after significant reduction days of home significant redoubt in in psychiatric hospitals. Significant reduction in a rest in days spent in jail because. Probably understood outcomes the next year when the budget was still in good shape. We did a B. twelve thirty four and were able to increase the amount of funding to fifty five million dollars. Now for the year. Two thousand and one through the next great reception in two thousand nine when I was M. despite too much in debt. Terms of the state budget. No guy ever saw to cut AB twenty thirty four because once again fifty five million. In thirty plus counties in one city I believe Berkeley. That prod demonstrated. Consistent positive and I say again easily public. Comes. Negative outcomes that were taxing the sit them in in huge waves. The late rusty see looks and I decided midway through that period of time that well we were very happy with the results with fifty five million dollars helping about five thousand people a year. Was obviously just a drop in the bucket and the a B. two thirty reserve covering up prevention early intervention or any of the. X. of untreated mental. He did props three and you know this. Right all the stakeholders together raise the minimum amount of money necessary for initiative and in two thousand four got fifty three bus burst the vote passed prop sixty three. I submit to you that. The story is told about the mental health services act. To me in it has been a great success get you can and I. Innovation a systems began to be transformed and most importantly of real people in the tens of thousands who have got that bond and whatever it takes in addition to the generally. Can strategies it. Test. And yet if it had had. Porsche fifteen if we're gonna be on. We did not apple eight eight B. thirty four AB twenty before. What kind of reporting to. The public in the state the outcomes. And it's a bit. Take as much responsibility as anyone because we got started with this thing back in two and five into. The checks but because in part. I think. This says. In addition is a two step. They sort of pushed way and. Take a course. French attitude towards they see it not putting words in their mouth. I'm selves but as a catalyst or to. Combined with a real pretty. Reform and being a single system. It is so when I look at the MHSAA part of the whole number little than just these couple is that okay should I just. Okay you have the floor okay. I'm sensitive to I think that you put ME aimed me in context in some ways it's been it's short comings have been blamed for some of the first to the mat health system but in truth the MHSAA it's actually one of five sept mental health. Got a major city we have we- bottom. Jails. Yeah we've got Medicare managed care and we've got commercial pay. And all of those disturbance act in it indirect. Integration and how we put all the massive sources are potentially if we had real parity by the way. Master sword under a single umbrella say what it take. It in there too often Commons story from people across all what say don says. For themselves loved one what ages pays room all of. Well in part because of. The lack of real parity and I don't when I talk about parity I don't. It's versus three visits for ten visits to a therapist I mean what's covered and what's not covered. A lot of the nation. Brown street and in some ways not cover. By and large kommer. HSA in part is had to be. Peanut butter. If you will spread rather Finley across a lot of different probes any tips. And as a result not that focus you spoken about in the F. rations this hearing. My what. The whole issue to. Did the day it was a whole. Thanks to flee. It is for the act. I know some of these are. The 90% of the full service partnership dollars on on sheltered homelessness brought on by a lot of different popular contain. A to a senior to tell. Other counties John Sheridan did in Los Angeles county that while they're doing with their full service partnership there. I would. Like the MHS focused on three categories. Help your home there are so most important imperative it's getting. A roof I've been very publication know about. All I hate to a room full ones permanent housing first navigation center and shelter is necessary but we have a tough public policy in this says it's okay for people to live out doors. I don't think it it. As you said twenty five years. Bless I know it same for people with untreated chronic mental this. Would like to see twenty focused on unsure homelessness on ale. Yeah diversion and after your for- leaked down by the way there's a huge laugh. The most problem and then on kids and I pick four categories in the you're just mine. Trauma based care for kids exposed to violence. The psychosis identification and intervention for teenage. College based mental health services an intense amount in the mental health services for kids child our system for your kids. I would like to see the money spent on that. And then to see an outcome based system at. Yeah rich but as simply understood is the eight four outcome based system the counties are responsible. Out comes around the money. And then. For their complete flex the lady and break the eighty S. held accountable for outcome. And I would use if you were back in the get into the. The books. Here the framework of the eight X. thirty six what was a transformative act. It created an outcome I'm for it chop. I would if not making progress comes date. Gradually beginning with technical assistance whatever assistance is needed help them meet those outcomes and go. Lee with the potential never to be used. Of us of St. Tension and to go over the county was not doing anything or spending money on other than what. The outcomes. Required. What I think we need to do not how and pay for this this is currently covered under the MHSAA. The MHSAA. That's reform of the image to say in my view needs to be. Discussion if we can gain those additional forces either from the insurance companies and or the federal government we can then insure that we're not doing any harm in making the M. essay. Which more focused and outcome based. What it is to do now we believe we can do some of this legislates a some of it. Can be done through executive order eventually might. Be done. I don't want to take the money from the counties I would like I think the companies do a great job. But I think between the state and the fifteen years we've gotten away. From the fundamental principle of AB twenty thirty four and twenty thirty four. Where we report to the public consistently. That these dollars are actually saving a lot also giving taxpayers. That's part of busting stigma by the way as well because people feel like all my god what is the money big reserves here this that and the other. Into a consistent about presenting outcome. Gonna believe that homelessness for exam. Isn't we know do if we only do a solid eight resources in a way that achieve the outcomes that we all will. Thank thank you and- we are used to senators not having time limits chocolate in place any on you thank you. Next we have Michelle Cabrera. A good afternoon chairman members Michelle cabinet at I'm the executive director with the county behavioral directors association of California. And very grateful to be sitting up here with the- author of the mental health services act to along with. The late resi Felix both of you giants in the field of mental health thank you so much for your work. It's true that. That mental health advocates for claim that we are in the midst of an unprecedented mental health crisis. Nationwide service. Are up and in California too few children are being treated for their mental illness. Depression and anxiety- up when Californians walk out of their homes they are confronted the brute brutal in humanity. Thousands of their neighbors living on the streets. Intent. X. many whom struggle with substance use disorders a mental illness. In the face of these challenges the reeds reports and serve MHS dollars. How it civil that forward in the image as a fourteen years ago if this is the state of the world. Have we failed. A friend now a resounding. The successes of the ME all around us hiding in plain sight. Today bridging the images say to the tune of almost billion federal financial. While at the same time the fact is that it's a- money. These sorts of interventions include prevention not paid for by medical school partnerships work force and in for infrastructure investments housing which foods rental subsidies board their patches building so I'll sing a vacation of. Landlord trip so important. Full part of this partnership. Employment and education services law enforcement partnership. We ride alongs with law enforcement we train them on how to better engage our client. Impart their live experience. H. meant find practices his portent in a state. This. Are there any roles with in my house the uninsured who are covered by our services and yes individuals with private commercial coverage. Who have been announced for understood. Despite the preemie they've- we fund research you are an HSA dollars and so much I literally could go on. So I'll start to describe it more of the con. I like senator. Where the a discussion today. Helps to point us to. Just they were experiencing at staff is also aired some. Which the pass up out to supplement my talking points we do start a. Many years ago and orders are sought help us address a man on the eve of the great budget wrist. The early ops we. Twenty two thousand six and the recession was just about. Without lower than they are today around two and fifty six million total state wide and yes today there are around two point four in I will note that just two years ago in twenty seven. We were receiving around one point seven billion HSA today at two point four. Stress it speaks to the relative of and what kind of today- but those changes well and so often counties are let trying to reach again it might happen next and wanting. They were able to sustain the rams. In the years of any real. Many of the N. MHSAA the MHSAA basically saved our public safety net from being decimated not only did we back fill the state director as the state directed us to in the budget process but the state also so close to a billion an image as a revenues into the state general fund was a top of truth is. In California and so. Justified the court to come out of the Great Recession we encounter several additional major changes to the public behavioral health system that I think are noteworthy the first one twenty eleven realignment which brings with a responsibility to find EPS D. T. mental health services for children and youth the implementation of the affordable Care Act which adds many many. New medic I'll enrollees both are. Parolees. Also people who work previous one not enrolled. And the within DHS the elimination of the department of health on top of. The changes but since the Great receptacle and pulled. Up to what's work. Compliant and faithful to the act- we have implemented with great fidelity to the regulatory and fiscal rules that have been laid out for us we've maximized the funding I we've incredibly successful at breeding funding and leveraging. The MHSAA and that's really how it is spread and did two is a- as I said earlier it's now can trip. Around two billion dollars and as money to medic cow- end this doesn't factor in the non medic hal reimbursed services onto the MHSAA and there are some. Peter is that it be working big public health and. What optional. A high and mighty top. No fast as the national rate. First city and also cultural relevance- it's really important in a state like California that we do invest in making sure that our services are more cold culturally appropriate and wall could do more. The fact that we. HSA has out as to innovate in this. Better the culture an early this program for a county that targets the meat Steckel community we have a community garden project that helps reduce stigma for the mom community to come in to services and in San Bernadino approach program that builds trust with homeless and- jewel's. Traveling veterinarian who support their pets and helps bring into services. This is ground breaking an effect. On prevention without the MHSAA we would not be able to do anything to fund prevention and stigma reduction typically not covered under insurance including. Where diagnosis and. Acuity requirements must be met in this on reimbursable. On the part for those individuals who We would argue that the service partnership model. The seat has. We've been doing it for over a decade now in California and we've gone beyond my cal the bronze McCourt Dale act blouse- requires us to serve individuals regardless of pairing California but only to the extent that resources are available and we would argue that without revenue we really wouldn't be able to. Catch to try to meet those. So what's wrong. Not done a great job they are so and I hope that and today. Hope to that. Loud. Ported in one county or another through the any to stay. How is this moving the needle state. Wide what about the store and we can't stop active. Hold up in state level and at this importing this requires a few things we need to make a state entity responsible for this this is a matter of investment and clarifying the rules of ours to state regulators we need to use the data that the counties are sending to the state even that will change like making the reports that we the second machine readable. Could help open up the thousands of. Nations counties have struggled the most. And what is new in the early the a season up strict interpretations of what constituted an innovation were extremely. As was approval process thanks to our leadership at the- this has changed but smaller counties trouble- in that their allocations are so small that it makes it almost impossible for them to lift up a group program. Flexibility park how can you my name. Is. A wonderful in that it requires us to engage communities and develop three year. Update brown how we spend our funding in several. Be easily from one complete. In the years before we had greater flexibility your evasions the significant. Issue when it county allocates. But the funding each pop no percent of our make. HM I 8% is not where we talk about on CS and what this means practically. Even if our community part. To invest more works. Job we're limited and can put their. Its restriction along with the inability to back to our story that assignment Bracey together we do need to move to a- small. Our counties of said give us the targets and we will meet them at the trade off for greater flexibility. Second district in that. We cannot use HSA funds on substance disorders this is important clearly the thing that the- as this crisis with an HSA funds. You would know as a clinician talked her out I'm glad that often. A person is struggling with addiction. Really hard to tell what the underlying mental illness. They're dealing with it is and until we can engage them and bring them services for their substance use to. It is very difficult what's going on there I'm are finding really categoric Janet and I am actually. Into play it out safe as well. We have to. Funding under SB eighty two which help the price. No place like home our recent today since their ships are work force through the M. say. He competed one county to another for a finite pot of funding and then we end up with differences from one to the other not based on- what makes the most sense or are does this CD six every. One who was able to compete for those for a resource and went out I would say that we need to level set our expectations me to say given how widespread the needs are for. Health safety net what role should the MA to say in that and that begs the question. In two day in medic cow overall working 25% of budget for Medicare. Yes mental illness the image is only 25% And I'm only 5% is. The only source of that we have for important activities of medic cow so for two to an outcomes based system how will medic how be aligned. To support those comes run counter to them. White outcomes. Is that the M. HSA supports our behavioral health system is staggering it's everywhere from providing critical investments in prevention and early invent intervention all the way through to providing critical support to the crisis. And a cute ends of the continuum and everything in between. If sure these dollars work well. Of the various about thank you for the opportunity. Thank you and we'll save questions for the and if that's okay- doctor Connelly deputy secretary of behavioral health with DH CS. Thank you Mister chair about your doctor ambulant thank you to the committee for having me today glad to be here to speak on behalf of the administration- and again appreciate your time and glad to be here. With me stop Bergen and others on the panel. Behavioral health substance use disorders. Is a critical element of individual and community well being a governor who some. Believe that all. Your health services that they need to live to live happy healthy and fulfilling lives. Proposition sixty three of the other panelists I've already mentioned is a key part of that the mental health services act is produced high quality. Shin and programs. Let's MHM things that's true we've we've discussed that already it's also an ambitious policy framework for providing comprehensive community based systems of care in all of the above approach or strategy for mental health- again it includes prevention earlier. Talked about these different elements of. Repent and others are supportive services that are needed also. In sure tan de. Gusman two other funding. Mental health services and of all been middle. Communities I'm in water community wellness goals that we have. The financing streams are structured though as we've heard- and they they are supportive of all of those different names but with different sort of structures and restrictions that are attached with them. Eight twenty related to services and prevention and- in those. Both of us service ports. Full part of full service partnership model. Current estimate it did an HSA will generate over two dollars Avenue during this fiscal year that is in. Them middle service delivery. Systems I kept up a billion we heard today. Port that a lot of that money also spent on medical funded services which is an effective strategy of up actually in large. And in our communities through accessing federal Medicaid matching funds with an HSA dollars. In addition a broad nature of the community services and supports component of an HSA enables- counties as we as we heard to support many services that are also not funded through medico. And the list. We're seeing across the state right now- images a services is helped have also help consumers reduce involvement in the criminal justice system. And create community. Input I mean there is the doctor five. For the deputy director of the department of health this is we'll talk about in the next battle as well. I mean to say both enables the medical program. More bust impact in this way that. Rapper the two. Or could back in unity- wide and human centered impact in terms of mental health services. Speaking of our communities I think one of the really innovative and valuable aspects of an HSA is it's intentional route- in community. And the community planning process. Increased to culturally and specifically linguistic services- in is truly unique in that fashion and it's a requirement written into the statute into the law- in some images say is special in that Californians have chosen to raise this revenue. Have voted in favor of this act and really or ties health wellness mental health and wellness. By a vote for this the side proposition. As I said at the beginning. Of the law is much more that funding source it's ultimately about impact. Enabling people to look healthy full lives. Up speaking just a little bit about the in. One very prominent example again as the full service partnership model. Of intensive community based out of service. Employing will take approach to provide service. Roughly two thousand people as of November second of this year or- in- in. Our programming as we call it. And that includes twelve thousand children up to the age of fifteen. Thirteen thousand transitional age with twenty six thousand adults and seventy five hundred older adults above the age of sixty. And that that service side that service- mock. Actually supporting some really I think tremendous- innovative programming counties just two examples of that instead Luis Obispo captives of. Treatment that provide services to individuals who are on formal probation for a minimum of. Two years and. For whom mental health treatment is been a fat burner legal different difficult. Program so it's not mandatory. And there are there are folks who have not been seen by other systems previously so. For decide discharge from jail and not engaged in services in a timely fashion- in addition St Bernard you know county has a very innovative. Transitional age youth- behavioral health hostile model called the state. This was a particularly entry model. So treatment for. Me ages it. Or it's a short term bond crisis residential center for those X. psychiatric episode- Christ's the program bases itself and therapeutic community design. And since it also has- impressive- interdisciplinary model in plain sight yet psychiatric nursing social service and vocational services- some outcomes that are impressive- with a significant issue related to psychosis or thought disturbance disturbance had those issues improve or resolved by district in addition there's a more holistic approach to carry. The percent of presented the next significant medical or otherwise physical. Issue had decided. In project so with that 5% set aside but given its successes now funded and the community services and supports- portion let me just say to support its ongoing. Operation. Impact of say the challenges Sir there is a success is the other panel. I'd metric analysis outcomes are are areas that we can all work on together establishing- and enhance monitoring process to establish statewide goals for children- transitional age youth adults. Older adults and families remain important areas for improvement okay currently draft three your plants in it based goals for. Their spending up dollars however we could benefit from a more explicit statewide planning process to establish what outcomes we expect from the funding for the programming what sort of can was quality improvement analysis and evaluation we expect. And how we communicate the- public and to our and how we can. As a more coalition to advance I think this is also a particular. Time of opportunity- as we've heard again- from the panel for behave. Transmit. The department of health care services recently relax reduced its California advancing at. Cal. Medicaid waiver renewals and- it's from the medical program. Haitian. But of Medicare reforms again signals up. And is there a opportunity of for example. Of health care services as has problems. Many member risk. Percent which is which again. I'll get over it will determine health in middle earth to. Work seamless thank Chris. Three improving outcomes driving delivery system transformation in modernizing systems and for integrating behave services within the broad array of help this is available in our communities and so. I think the terrific aspect of these goals is that all I'm applied it may just. So MHD pro instate goals. No in two both both programs impact of service act that supported by both of those those vehicles coordinate service to more fully address consumers. Person fashion more I think that I may just taxable all of the above approach through. Aug medic out in the new focus. The determinants of health Brenda divisions DH CS will also comment later panel about the L. callin a later this afternoon. In June. Converse with consumers family is counties later holders to create more stable statewide miss in our expectations for it and I just say how we align that with Caroline we also need a commitment to push toward that common set of goals that we agree upon and use enhanced data collection to Kitty- continuously push ourselves now comes in and finally. It important that we don't lose the local flexibility and as of community interventions program. That will help to those. Connelly Dr Huber. Tech distraught. A check person around Mila and the color. Often he service thank you for the opportunity Hey my name is doctor Nicole Eberhart and I'm a senior behavioral scientist at the rand corporation my ran colleague Dr socks got actual it is also in attendance and available to answer questions today. Rand is a nonprofit nonpartisan research organization headquartered in Santa Monica California. Rand has been conducting independent county funded evaluations of proposition sixty three known as the mental health services act for over eight years I am eager to share some of what we have learned as you contemplate the future of mental health funding in California. Proposition sixty three as we all have discussed has greatly increased funding for mental health in California. I'm with new funding comes new responsibility to evaluate the resultant programming to understand its impact and ensure effectiveness accountability and value. To this and I will share some key findings of rand's of operations a prop sixty three programming with you today. I'll start by discussing some of successes and then I'll examine some of the challenges to implementing prop sixty three. At six that's number one new capacity. To provide prevention and early intervention so. With a 20% The intervention or P. hello sign extensive expansion of P. I. programming around you see the team evaluated evidence based earlier intervention programs for children in Los Angeles county and found that children who receive these P. I. services benefited we looked at vulnerable children receiving preventive care and found that nine out of ten good well meaning that despite their of Arbil. The low the threshold clinically. And if you get mental health issues wi fi and got. Please of symptoms can. Deliver immersive events media the root of the campaign found that it reached more than one in five Los Angeles county youth in a short period of time exposure to this campaign it was a system with more support. Around mental illness more knowledge of how to help for mental health problem. P. I Ming at it while. Angeles county's camp new the mental health services already mesa has been and. Men's health the I. campaigns twenty then come it is a joint or thought hound he's pulling reimburses to gather our projects are valuation on the cow Mrs P. I. campaign which Californians and improve key outcomes they were associate reduce stick back toward those of mental illness increased use of mental health services and increase confidence to interview. Those at risk for suicide. Success number two expanded capacity- individuals with serious mental illness. Prop sixty three enabled expansion full service partnership or FSP program that as other panelists describe revised wraparound service is that do whatever it takes to help those with serious mental illness. With participation is associated with improvement in key outcomes this is again a Los Angeles county so it's no criminal justice this involvement hospitalization for mental health. Action primary care. Sex free proxy deep ramming it says David caught. Savings associated with specific components a prop sixty eight. In evaluating costs associated with LA county's FSP program. We found that the program reduce service related expenditures by eighty three million dollars. Twenty five that reduction. The cost savings were largely to. Reduce spending on a person among adults although there are the big. So help hospitalization and homelessness we also found evidence that cal mesa statewide P. I. programs you'll that positive return investment for example the each my matter stigma reduction campaign. Is associated with increased treatments which is projected to. Thirty six dollar return to the state for every dollar invested the higher. Yeah I program is college in unit. Our system with increased use of mental health treatment which is projected to increase graduation rates in turn leading to higher lifetime earnings an average return to the state of six dollars for every dollar invested. Suicide in training programs are also projected to return money to the state the reverted medi cal emergency care because it's a set. Times and increase state thank. That's benefit analyses do not capture all the financial personal or societal benefits improving. Our saving someone's life is valuable regardless of the cost. What's one limited funding for state by Pierre projects. Although prop sixty three has some notable successes challenges still remain some P. I. programs could be more efficiently implemented as a statewide effort than by each individual county. However California's decentralized county minister mental health system to challenging to work on projects counties only contribute a. Small portion of that I funds to the comments the state. Amount has greatly how Mrs infection and then I such. It projects at the level they were at when we conducted many of these evaluations well we found some promising results these games have likely not been fully maintained. Challenge number two this is something some of the other panelists have spoken to it well limited capacity for whole person care. It's a mental health the highly vulnerable popular. Elation and unemployment. The criminal justice system or with the department of child and family services. The current system is prepared to treat all of people's complex it's in a coordinated manner. The because it is not set up to compensate whole person care to best serve California to mental illness California may need to develop the first meant and for me consist. Support whole person care all its consumers. Challenge number three insufficient county level evaluation data just something again other panelists have spoken to. Invite sixty three funding we found that we did not always have the right data to answer our evaluation questions for instance some key indicators of recovery from serious mental illness are not being measured by count is another outcomes are not being measured as well as they could be. California can facilitate future evaluation by updating it mandated data collection proceed. Careful consideration to be taken to minimize non county mental health provider one I think the utility of the data collected. Thank you thank you doctor mark finally we of course how she died from the LA a. Good afternoon to the chair into the- the committee- might. Deal with the legislative analyst's office. There should be now a package of form the basis of offices remarks today. I'm I'll be presenting on several issues within a major day and potential solutions to those issues that the legislature could consider to improve the academic forward. Before I begin I just want a knowledge six is within images say that a couple of our- that couple of. Eggs on the panel have spoken to- no doubt that they've absolutely. Able within the act. I'll be referencing pages up and- base from this page. At the circle. For me an MH assays work for men component. Providing background information on that funding. And several options for the legislature to convince her to increase funding for sports programs going forward. This material the end of our hand out. Getting on. We describe the first issues let's. Relate to map out. Okay however these are often not tied to meaningful and measurable targets. There are also intended outcomes in the act for different components such as homelessness reduction under the prevention and early intervention component but it isn't clear to what extent there's an outcome based strategy. That encompasses all of the ME they. Potential solutions legislature could seek to make. How come only in images they are well. Developing durable targets link to these outcomes. It is there the legislature identify new outcomes. Was as well. And finally the legislature could provide policy direction to facilitate a strategy. That incorporates measurable outcomes at a higher level covering all of them a to say. Moving to page three. We describe the next issues for legislative consideration. Two evaluation infrastructure. Data collection and outcome measures is not consistent pretenses. This entity is responsible for comprehensive evaluation functions are provided with adequate resources to do so we know that images they oversight responsibility. Are currently split between the department of health care services and the men this is all. But he can play see. What cap may be available for this purpose. The legislature could also provide policy direction on infrastructure sure is. The elected aligned with measurable outcomes successful practices can be equally shared among counties and between counties in the state. And that it's clear what entity or entities will be responsible for carrying out a more rich robust evaluation strategy. Moving to page four we describe our last issues for legislative consideration. To the need for new. Framework to guide fun isn't. Car and make a funding is not explicit. The act reflects a policy called to prioritize treatment over prevention and early intervention services the inflexibility in this broad funding allocation does not allow the focus of a major same plantation to shift if new information on program effectiveness comes to light. Potential solutions the legislature provide policy direction to develop a framework for using outcome. Data. Straight to be through with. They're seeking the authority to periodically reassess funding allocations if evidence. Indicates that funding should be redirected toward different practices. Your cooking seeking many allocation to dated priorities we know that it's unclear if that seeking voter approval and also know that care for the duration to be given the potential trade offs if funding is redirected away from certain categories. If this is the case alternative funding sources may be needed to sustain programs in those areas. Finally beginning on page six. But some background information on the workforce development component of an HSA as well as option for increasing work force funding going forward. Currently Cappies can dedicate up 215% of MHSAA revenue to work force education and training or wet grams. However the ceiling also includes the total funding counties may dedicate to capital and technology and prudent reserves. As mentioned our hendo and in the materials for this hearing. Extra in its initial. Years fun otherwise going to counties. For other part was directed to five what is. Figure out six described types of programs these plans addressed. After that funding expired in seventeen eighteen the legislature provided additional an HSA funds. On a one time basis for what in eighteen nineteen. And twenty. Am I say funds- fund to fund five year will. Be twenty. Counties are also now required to provide thirty three per and in may answer but- you're on page seven describes annual average what funding by fiscal year. We know that finding going forward is considerably lower than fighting in the axe initial years was. If the legislature wishes to increase funding for what programs. Dedicate additional portion state cap funding for this. Purpose dedicate additional general fund for this purpose. Or dedicate funding wise for local. Done in the years of the images say. With that I'll conclude our offices remarks thank you. The thing with that just for housekeeping purposes we will do public comment at the end of. All of our panel so- with that I will bring it up to the door and see any question. Number four thank you sure. So it's she the. The expertise in which all of you. Hi today what I'm looking for is a legislator. In a fire problem what is going to cost and- so what you need to do to fix it. I don't know I'm going. We didn't do that. Now what we're gonna do to fix the- you know we always talk about if you can does owns. Duffel with yes. I want. The experts to come to this legislature and say if you do this and you find this we will get you this. Simple as that. You tell us go with the wet we spent four hundred and forty five million dollars of mesa. I don't have any data tells me. Or yeah how much we- I already in California in before for Reagan. That we did have a mental health. Hospital. No we do have hospitals which are prisons for the criminally insane. But we don't take an- consider the wind DDS decommissioned the DC's. The mental help take over I spoke. Not re will assist the work before was it meant something that. Actually have. How comes fun with expectations. No in my county of Solano I have. Beds for car. Okay. In there because we were coming home. My. Sosa need good prices bed I think they're buying. It in the- three hours to get bounced to the- the hospital. In our area. If it's a fifty one fifty they stay for seventy two hours or less and then there. Then put into county jail. Tell us what we need to do to us. How much do you need. Give us a number. And then the you promise that you will fix it. That's what we're looking for we have Stamberg whose lead. Cold you don't need to. What version fixes this is somebody will make it a priority. To help these poor people they need the help that they so deserve a bleak me. And we don't have to have these battles in. Nexus from the right address he. Thank you Sam remember Fraser. One of the skills I had to learn being of position was asking questions and not having to because many statements because it. Led to you trying to understand a problem that was more complex than there was before us. And I do want to focus a little bit if I can. Feinberg as the author of the mental health service. With rusty see lex. You said initially this was a home. If. You said after four teen years you and the public feels it's- turn. I'm with- looking to complete the round I think insufficient chin homelessness. Not in every county in every county. The home. Say not enough the full service partnership requirements are broad day is long as an individual that's the definition of serious and persistent mental illness they can qualify now the people receiving full service partnerships if they're not homeless. They are neat they. They have a real neat it's not to diminish in any way he'd. Question that's really be the hard question being after everyone agrees on out we need to have more not. Disturb think that's easy consensus and that has been a shortfall if of the act. The top issue though. Is whether or not the act should be focused its expenditure should be focused on. Several things as opposed to many things it's a foot off the question in a way. Do you want to do a few things really. Or do we want to do it. All in holes it throughout the stem. When I say that the initiative initially was thought of not exclusively but largely around the issue of homelessness. An icy are ninety thousand on sheltered homeless people in California I want this act more focused on on sheltered homes. Though an obviously had to integrate with those on this that suffer. From serious mental as enter substance abuse because I agree with gel the cold curry disorder. Make sure do a refresh assembly member Frasier is that it will become what occurs often in the legislation isn't a criticism it's an observation. That every stay cold or will have an outcome that they want. And then you'll have the outcomes. That will create a consensus. And no prescription in the act in it. No that wouldn't be content. Do we want to billion dollars do you really. On. Three things as it was to twenty thing. I said in my it the way dressed my objective what I think should be acted jetted bout focus is to integrate this with Calais him and with the real parity discussion and real parity action the peace in cal matters today about how we can even get a reporting bill through the legislature. Time and governor really speaks to how far I have to go to actually have it. But there's a lot of money you know I was happy to raise. I think you look. Just problem we probably need more money but this is a systems problem and the systems have to work much better together to meet the objectives that we lay out MHSAA should. Not be that what was the term that somebody used are. Shin the rebar at I don't think. I think you should the driving. Five towards the most serious unaddressed consequences of untreated mental illness I laid out my categories and people could play out different categories fair enough. I'm sheltered homelessness people cycling in and out of jail. And kids writ large break the kids it is enough three four five category. And that's. As we are to be get the public knowing that they're getting huge. Here necessarily by the way because the lack of parity in because of the lack of. An aggressive way right that's what I that's what I think we should all be striving for. You speak talk systems and this is a physician what learn body systems you're a pulmonary cardiovascular of renal system and yet you need all parts working to stay healthy. Out of my issue when looking at mental health has been how fragmented the system is even within mild moderate and serious and persistent. Yes and the struggle that comes with that- Cabrera brought up so of being substance abuse within those treatments and. I do think the administration is on a very good. For calling him and I don't mean to get ahead of ourselves here. I knew then what role mental service act will plot and if I can delve deeper into something you said Michelle Cabrera. You said F. as peas were the seed for whole person care. I guess my question is it and redundant if we have a whole or how we. Ensure that the money is our big fan both quest all truly comprehend what a- but what is it play a role if whole person care becomes a statewide program an entitlement. So it is very much in line with the hell he- a panel but of course at you know what I was. Give a nod to mayor Steinberg around the service partners. It takes out all in that. It's been around for a while it has and based in county behavioral health and with our contracted. Providers or when counties are running them themselves through small. We are wrapping. Is immensely clients with. Whatever they need to see children the help. The thing. Two drivers and- our medic to find a place to live get them I'm. Not sure is treatment but purpose so that they can hello in the long run I. Have a at some of. Until the end of life that is nature of his chronic illnesses and- but but the prescription for that is not a medical model prescriptions solely and I do believe that the rest of medic how. Is stretching to try to catch up with public behavioral health has has had a strong foothold. For some time how I think it ties back to Callie is that this state I tried. Structure within medic how managed care plans and it will be a stretch for- plans because it's not really their bread and butter and so counties are prepared and willing to. Work very closely with medic how managed care to make sure that- complex beneficiary the crop delivery. Are able to benefit. From. So the three the level and intensity of housing services and supports that we're able to provide as county behavioral health that's not what's being provided or. Under in lieu of services thank. Manage distant site looking to score a win with CMS on return on investment by avoided emergency room visits we're really looking to improve people's lives and help them in their cover in the long run and so it might not be too avoided enough emergency room visits to compensate for the fact that you're helping someone get an education and achieve employment status over the long run but you've if you've helped that per person find their perfect. And well being than by our. Our goals have been met. So I think. Are some unique I'm I think one of the- a better grade girl health. Support systems not just our health system but our public safety child welfare education. And other systems much more effectively. Again we're already there we need to improve how. Systems and I just feel. Part discussion and my calc framed the been about getting to work with our partners and so now we're in here my meaning to try to challenge but to say that. We have opportunity to try to make improvements as well you have found if I keep. This one more question and pass it off to someone. I wanted to ask the infrastructure. To switch were a key component early on with then MHSAA. But seem as if they have not. Continue to receive funding while. They're still a need for a diverse workforce and more bets. One are the property. Or how we work to ensure that. Can build the beds that are needed as well as- continue to train the work force that's the- so there are two parts to this question one is on work force and one SR crisis beds all take the crisis that. In first- we as counties are interested. Happy to see to cal apply for a new. Unity provided by the fed broke up. And the Alef endemic. I receive federal financial participation so medic Medicaid funding of federal funding for- stays in what are considered in some mental disease I am dis. These are for mental health facilities of more than sixteen beds. Which means no state money for individuals who have to be in- oftentimes impatient but also other settings for their mental health trip. This. Is which to be institution and put unity rather than have them. Face being locked up for the rest of their lives these are really important tenants of our community behavioral health movement and we need to- preserve them however. The big sucking sound in cap behavioral health budgets today are these days that we're we're spending our realignment dollar sign we don't have a lot left over for unity based services. When we have. Full at that cute end of the spectrum and it does tie back to parity because when individuals with private commercial coverage are not able to get the care they need- and they fail in to the public behavior health system- they end up medic how beneficiaries the B. and- beneficiaries of the public behavior health system. And it ends up costing all of. Tivoli need to take some time the federal waiver is very carefully crafted it- provides for a maximum of thirty. Day length of stay in these I. M. D. facilities so it and require. I maintain the current. Both based mental health services in California but demonstrate that were actually in. Number. Very balanced and cost wave needy our counties are really eager. And what what is we guarantee that we would take the new money that we could bring into our system with this waiver and build out the community based continuing because once we create new capacity. In lower levels levels of care we can step people down to assembly member Frasier's and get people moving on the cover not have them be stuck at it it to show up. Whether it's not he- you have to do something to start to fly to create better flow here. Every thing where. Talking. About into terms of community baby be health this is. To be working how space. Their top not one issue everybody's focus on it it's really exciting but we will not be able to do one tenth of the things we aspire to do. It we don't as a state. In infrastructure. And that is. All das places. So even to it did get the job done on certification so that we can pull in federal dollars for our medic help as well that's going to be step one and help our work force- step. Can help forces we need a. Round gaps. System we don't accept that for any Kerr were. Especially for behavioral health works we need to at all levels out it is a state for who's needed where. It see about that I'm so that's another. Piece for yes MHS it was being discreet work force it gives region by region. State your is if you're Shasta and you're trying to recruit a psychiatrist- Sierra county told me they don't not only do they not have a six in the county they don't have a stock they don't have a one way try the psychiatrist wants to move there it's really really tough and you know. He's been try. Me at. If I'm as a state about how we're going to. You know ensure access to people of the state but that that's. Really also a matter of your ship and we're really excited as we like the mention. And I'm trying to address those solutions and I will bring it full circle if I can because maritime Burke talked about the right to have. Your shelter as you would wish. And. Yet the array one of. My very rarely say this about the land. Initially with. Regards to. This was that we- right to housing as well we did in the I. D. D. community. And I. Sorry mayors are no no no no I just. It's a key point. Well in its it. We don't have autistic kids out on. And yet we have mentally. People who also. Comes out on the street and there's a role for the legislature to work towards. Can I just respond. Okay your point he make I. Hope I didn't take it from you are you. Like I say the identical thing. All of the time illustrates what's at stake here potentially with MHSAA re. So I do I'm not in New York city's. Form of a right to shelter H. said to be getting. Because they are having in class. The intense. Case management services in an effort to get people into permanent housing in their system and yet. The result lawsuit some for many decades. In New York City 95% of the un sheltered. 95% of the homeless population sheltered and indoors five out. During you at a thousand B. to California as well. And so what does it cost them to do a very in perfect right to shelter we would want to do it better. About one point six billion dollars a year to bring seventy five thousand people indoors. Our. Estimate California is that there are ninety thousand on shelter. Beat up. There one point six billion to do it right to say two point five billion. You don't think we could find two point five billion dollars a year for. Distinguished horses in this state. B. A. L. this. In this area yes the shame on all. If MHSAA were focused in the way that I described. Hey we didn't hurt anybody because we will then the rebar with medi cal managed care and. And a and D. we couldn't find the first billion dollar. Both of that to put. Estimated get houses. People first and roof and then to get them to help in the services. All the men triple H. jin other local. Couldn't get to two point five million dollars and. Actually get close to ninety thousand people indoors using the MHSAA. I think we could and that's what. This is becoming. An epidemic crisis not only public health and public it was becoming a political crisis. And why shouldn't this acted. Originally was intended. Going to action okay or not all of the money. One four billion. Some of it already going down shelter. And then at. Cap six hundred fifty million dollars to maybe will come this this next year of the budget is still killing okay. And we could put together the resources action. Next is to get that put that state. An academic discussion about wouldn't it be nice if we made MHSAA more more outcome based. Be a real discussion here about priorities as well. Thank you. Are you sure your belief 1100% What I see the is. We've got a great study back for that did you really. Sure was two point two billion efficient. Sir you care for the. In California two point two billion dollars deficient. Yeah we did nothing about it in the budget we augmented for thirty five million dollars but. The need is two point two billion dollars that is. My first visit I've been elected official. For seven years I've- I might thank you me answers you guys are the experts give me the he says my frustration because that's a lot of money and we made promises when we go out for a ballot measure. Asking for help. In the counties are paying for it stays open it. Bears repeating for everything. Everything's. Closed and they pay for everything proof. Hard work but we won't. They have an expectation that there's gonna be a are you but what I'm just not step. For me to this so when you talk about housing I was a general contractor developer. When we talk about green in numbers and mandates. Through municipality what the required affordable of moderate the acidic is there come. Should it. It has this it additional housing component requires municipalities to have a dramatic impact in this field or they don't get their past through. Number two. I'm not seeing a lot of effort would collaborate. At the counter if on this I see. You know then and I'm not trying to knock the counties but I see some county sitting on a large amount of mesa money also that stagnates that's not being utilized. My county was one of them. Matter of fact it was three o'clock is with mayor Steinberg lives of. Them but I felt very strongly. In some. Money party had made to us. With the. That is that creates that requirement from for this better not mitigation but trying to get a handle on this housing own number but. So components so if it's kind of look. Happen because we think was this in housing is optional involuntary all optional we do the best we can it's all bottom up there is no legal requirement that we bring that provide a roof for everybody in this state and it's over. A public policy and then we. Our resources. Yeah imperative. It's going to continue to that is not it's not the it's all of us is not just the counties thank you for the county it's the city's it's all of us meant when I'm trying to say is I agree with you. Talk about spreading Pena thought yeah. We throw a lot of stuff. A little amount of it a lot of stuff and get very small. You're right we do need to prime eyes. Hard to make it it's- just very little games. On this question of homelessness if I may chair- I think it's important to note to in a few cases of this. One is. With all due respect to- mayor Steinberg. Of I'm- our worry center and- individuals who face under the plan to Max who are among our homeless population- we have an LA county are homeless outreach team who did a survey of the nineteen most. Vulnerable people living a good row five of. The nineteen- regional center client. So that to me ask. To see if they can tear in the net for people who have. Phillips as well as mental illness- I think that this is in a really important issue that we need to address and unfortunately it does get rolled up in the bigger issues around homelessness. On homelessness- this is another area where I don't know that I quibble. So much with the solutions fairly we do need to. Press the- illness. Is to preserve. Countless people living on the streets- I definitely at I can tell you and I can provide you with the research and analysis that backs this up- be. Issues are not what's being our- crisis to. It is one. Income inequality and there being no place for very low income people to live and so if we want to get people off of the streets quick we need to provide them with subsidies we need to provide them with affordable places to live other wise as a consequence of a failure to act to. The low income people find a place we're going to the menu. Do you sing more. Behavior health because my of extended time living on sheltered on the streets definitely will has and we have an active we have. Back this up it creates it it exacerbates it worsens people health conditions. So that. Not many it act. Two police. Are people going into homelessness that is the import and we do not have a farm. This conversation about the other things that we're finding. Prevent inter services these three buckets because it is I'm not enough comfort for us a two we definitely are not looking at cal aim as a back fill for what might be lost if we shift these resources around somewhere else so we do think that there needs to be of a fuller conversation about that not to create more peanut butter at so that we can make sure that core infrastructures not. Austin to achieve very important other games. Seems like a perfect. Thank you very much again I think it was great. Thank you thank you thank you. So we'll we're not his. Engine temperature in here next go to Michelle Garber. Thank you and I hope you don't get too tired of me by the end of today. So the- panel was presented with several questions about of the 20% of the mental health services fact finding which goes to fund prevention and early intervention. And one of the questions was does California need a larger in. Of prevention and early intervention services and- the end. Yes half of all counts. I am cases of diagnose. Mental illness begin by age fourteen and three. Buy it for us this alone points to the fact the absolute bigger investment and prevent. Intervention the medical model often compelled us towards a feel our system of care where an individual must read me a diagnosable state of sickness before a treatment can be delivered and our entire system is oriented around trying to reduce overall costs related to that disease burden. Prevention it came she could be the point but it's not currently California spending an estimated four hundred million dollars on prevention and early intervention services through the MHSAA this is the crowning that on it the jewel in our crown. However I have to be that this should not be a set up where we're robbing Peter to pay merry as that we have outstanding significant debt to both of them. Part of the reason my cow port. Removing the percentage like he ends that are built into the act. If a cow. Improving the lives of millions with serious mental illness was to invest save. 25% maybe thirty of its funding the intervention or prevent it would not be permitted to do were essentially locked into a model boxes up the pie. Purpose of prevention and inter Andean under the MHSAA to prevent mental illness is from becoming so disabling a proof time access for under served under served populations and remove stigma US seven negative outcomes associated with untreated mental illness and I'll just put a pin in that because- you will see that here under prevention and early intervention outcomes. Have already been built into the fabric of the MHSAA and those outcomes are homeless this suicide removal of children from their homes educational failure unemployment criminal justice involved and prolong suffering- these goals are also put up along side. Groups of reducing disparities- and promoting recovery in other goals there are certain things that counties are required to do your prevention early intervention and certain things that are optional so the required bucket we are required to fund to prevent activities except first. Counties we are required to do early intervention outreach for Christine the recognition on the early signs of mental illness and access and linkage. To be meant as well as stick my next. Optional are improved the act as for underserved populations and believe it or not suicide prevention counties already have to determine- mental health indicators that are used to measure a reduction to prolong Sir suffering and- for any of the other six a negative outcomes the program six. To affect. Also to make our intended reductions of each and then explain how were- evaluating this so we do actually do a lot right now related to outcomes measurement those sorts of things. But again it within the required framework that we've been given by our regulators so if there are any assistance is it's that we haven't been. Existent template or if those aren't the right outcomes the ones that we- I am a guy that we've been given that men. Were also mixed a further refinement. In early intervention fund. To SP one oh oh four of two thousand eighteen which outlines the following priorities for. Mentioning the intervention childhood trauma prevention. And early intervention early six and mood ordered. Reaching age meant a one at get a student and I need you that was college of programs and culturally attend linguistic programs and strategies to target the mental health needs of older adults and older adults it's really important as- aging is actually associate with a- higher likelihood of and- almost. Be here health directors. Not support the state- limiting what we can do in terms of prevention and prevention up to just practice toward what are considered back. This is. The reason is that with a population is versus California it's imperative that we work alongside individuals with mental illness and our local communities to lift up. New ideas new interventions and ways of expressing already tested best practices that were- with these different populations. These are our- this isn't as we develop new programs in new ways to. And we build a new evidence that we've actually done this through the MHSAA if things are researched and a value to it that's their outcomes. Examples and this is just sort of a list so to give you a sense of evidence E. I. models that we're currently fun- peer support. This is going to talk more about up the space shuttle from what we would have brought that to California without the MH day- early psychosis programs were currently developing bees in half of all counties- including in Solano county where- like hell but if. He's as well as Kaiser commercial beneficiaries have been able to access those services. Funding advance directive for mental health this is super important for Jules who- may end up in the crisis end of the continuum because it allows them to express their desires for treatment- and then in addition to this training. For it land as well as school force meant to help them de escalate and know how to engage with individuals with serious mental health art county behavioral health directors. Very much support movement in the direction of a more population based health model for behavioral health delivery where we can double down on prevention and early intervention we believe that any movement to reshape the MHSAA. Must recommit the state to these important goals and draw from all the great work we've already done in this space and again that gets back to the hole. In our conversation we just had up to focus the inmates say where to put the attention you know the one thing I did not. And the list at. Out was put in check and you know we have to look at how are we as a system going to prevent individuals from entering the public. Health system in the first place when. Art by. Some kind right there's gotta be accounted. That end are the public safety net we're there right now to help catch people. When they fall but to many people falling into our system. I would argue at he says that. Sing societal part things like hold off. Problems the engines out some the case of homelessness can argue that. Our do it in this way to say to prevent our clients from tree homelessness in the first place we can't prevent- the volumes of people they're going coming into. Today writ large and so the. The chain and the strategy to address that on a statewide basis must be much. Bigger the we would argue is for all our systems to do better- we need to go beyond our basic parity requirements and go the extra mile to acknowledge the need for improved access and bill. Put up police say because this pro. In the commercial. System as well as public system we need to start to take serious mental illness. Crisis will be one- not solely with an HSA reform thank you. Next we apparently on mir. But it's good afternoon. My ex afternoon inter person around the life members of the assembly budget subcommittee I'd like to thank you for this opportunity. Discount to depart. I'm almost person who has been empty purse. Anyway sorry but it is blessed it is my history so- when MHSAA was just about what initiative with prop sixty three- and as nami affiliate member and eventually I nami California board member. I advocated for that passage of this proposition hello with so many. Date pass the- have watched and contributed and impacted by prop the- its maturation as MHSAA. During this time at the very beginning actually. On. I have I was on. Because of M. HSA funding I was eventually employed to run a large peer run organization in Los Angeles county call project return peer support network. Which has a nearly 90% MHSAA find it. It's very our pure organizations around that date- primarily it just say find it I was. The MHSAA find dead stigma reduction- each mine map first the first PP mantra. People would say well wait are you and that and then they would tell me about their cousin or their sister or themselves live with a mental health condition and- I could get help I am. Nine I'm not. After spending four years working for the federal government the director of the office of consumer affairs the thought he said. This is minutes. Work for the county of LA. Like dancing. Up without the MHSAA funded in the program was to take. So I'm. You would a not just a year and a consumer but I. T. E. R. I am the evidence that MHSAA programs can achieve their intended outcomes especially for those like me who been diagnosed with that schizophrenia I'm a suicide attempt survivor and have. Experienced homelessness. Even though we're talking a lot about numbers and die. I think it import. It you have this kind of yes in this time. I believe that no one would want to be my friend- that I was not worthy of help and worse that I was not worthy of love I did not even believe that my struggles were due to having a mental health condition. I rejected any form of help and I also. Rejected the people who loved me and supported me the most and that's my- only. It specially appear. Like me as- an American woman. Having access to support in ways. And it was like dipping my toe in the water and giving it a try it is. First described. Help them giving them this opportunity to just try it out our MHSAA programs touch the lives of so many for those in most need- people at risk of homelessness as an example are outcome from appear respite. Shows peers are successful in people that shelter in house. Your respite the voluntary short when I. Right community based. Crisis port to help find. And it's. Transformation grant. Grant ran out they were continuing with and just fun. A lot less county adopted dot model opened up to peer pressure centerless county again. Turn off. And then because of its. Shifted to arm a CSS funding- and then currently there's a new restaurant opening on me to county which will also be I am to say dollars. Would it lead need more pure rest across the state to reach and support people. And connection to treatment and supports people with very high complex needs living with Smith says and co occurring substance use disorders need to know your approach and people meet where they are to. Better. They're trained in evidence based practices such as seeking safety Wallace recovery action plan intentional Pierson. And professional interviewing and with the addition of sharing their personal story of recovery with interest support. We see- and evidence has shown that people move from homelessness to being house. Unemployed or on disability to employ and from the least to show. Your support is also proven to help people participate in and it here to try and. Family members to feel confident believe. We were really hoping this year with SB ten that well we know what happened. You know what happened a little. While but what we're really hoping is that we can join the other forty eight states. To certificates. Working on site provide to address. With your mental health condition our current substance use conditions. An HSA funding is needed now more than ever to ensure that we have. Robot array of recovery and resilience evidence. This. That are based on evidence does in the most need. Those outcomes live it to the people who are being served sometimes I think thinking about things very traditionally. The tree. To medication. Being in a hospital when in fact some of the things we're thinking about that Medicaid mean find certain P. no just having a friend being able to hang out with some able to. Connect with a with a lot. How to do that I'm we- want to make sure that those outcomes are important to us as well when funding has arbitrate limits that do not support counties to address plaques needs I worry that we can never be able to address- the needs of those who are. More than house houses the physical structure we actually don't pull a community meeting and I cystic here the ports recovery. Only at. The need. We need this and we deserve better. Of the street that folks are home. They're looking for is love and people not math or other things that are real interest for them to really look. Next shipping out there and connected. This can do in the community. So I telling you my- pretty now the only thing I can stress is that this is not really about statistics as I said I am not a statistic my peers are not a statistic our family or not statistics this is about people and unfortunately. Com. So I wish we could have a very simple answer but they're- never usually a simple answer to. We need something to drink that allow it relentlessly go after practices practitioners peers and program that can help those who most need to thrive and for community to thrive as well. And I know it can be and I'm here. Today because evidence that it can be done and I'm not the only. I might. Leader leaders as well so free is not easy. To say funding to help us move forward in our recovery thank you. Thank you miss merry and- before we go on the Toby Ewing I just wanted to say that. Important peer support is. Not been advocating because I sought success within the emergency department. It was this year. Order through SP ten and how we can go forward with that piece of legislation. But if my office can be helpful at all I'd like to be able to with you and anyone. Else who's interested in that. Next we have to be. Definite to chair. Mister Mister amulet the stripper staff. I've sat in this room with you are in the other room actually many times and so I appreciate your persistence on this issue you know I was able as hall. For the. Panel this conversation aren't new there are. Okay you taking time some of the files and. I heard a lot of hobby brief just because of the time and I certainly will get. It's funny to call the E. which may have- there's a couple of things that I just wanted to highlight. That the it is the P. to say that really sets it up. If you go back to that. California struck our mental health system before today yeah who was no strategy to engage early our system rationed access based on the severity of an illness and so family members and community members consumers came to the little Hoover commission at the time and said that many people were turned away because the illness was not sufficiently severe than to qualify for care so the P. I. component. Of the M. HSA. Is this elegant vision pace that recognizes that we can't afford to treat our way out of the challenges that we faced in California whether it's homelessness or criminal justice involvement. Tell off of me so many of the. In terms of the seven negative outcomes the thunder PI- PI also was monumental and that is identified that brought a ray of outcomes and if you look at the- up to the merging or. Or global definitions of well being put forth by the United Nations or the position tracking among operation develop. A line very closely. To the notion that people may perform. An employee being in one with that. Health safe and avoiding service seventh. So P. I. is groundbreaking because it says that we need to invest in strategies that are upstream that engage people very early and very cost effective ways and do so beyond the traditional clinical modalities of what we might think of this as mental health and the language I think torque it was a little shocking to our mental health system because it called upon the system. Is that it had not in the past in in that ten. Time Sistine over the. Issue is around how many span. Or over the purview of behavioral health directors. May not. The tool women for example or to address housing rights and that's very real. One of the one of the ways in which. This tension at least that to the commission that we see it. Is up there as pot. Purses the image there is a revenue stream. I think it's very clear the- well and it. Today a and heading even with said more than. Rating are insufficient if we're going to think about prevention in. Terms of all of those things and so we don't we don't think that way listening. To have what we think about this. The mission really design systems that will support prevention that touch upon all of those issues not just through the delivery of mental health. Services and responses and not even just through public sector. Dollars but the cop and today was around the commercial side okay. But if. And at full or reducing child deaths so many of the interventions that the state has been promoting have nothing to do with spent a public dollar and they have to do with education and awareness and changing behavior you know raise your hand if when you were a kid to put suntan lotion on. And raise your hand if you're not doing that today because we learned a lot about what it means to provide. It prevention is really leverage not just the financial resources that the state has made available through I just say or to the other phone at end up to support our county driven public mental health system so a I heard a lot about the various components to the M. HSA. In about some of the pertinent that were there they're in every county there is one or more bands that are fundamental key care- ticket we've he of her and today we can highlight more- the commission has really been working to identify a handful of those programs that are cost effective and begin to roll those out as a statewide strategy not necessarily in every county early psychosis programs the best example that we have with support from the legislature- with support and partnering with. UC system and the money's. If seven. As was mentioned it's partnering with us to try to build out a statewide system of or the- Roach- in partnership with our universities and it's a learning piece to that. Head space came up with to call all co here- the school mental health work suicide prevention work the commission recently adopted the state. Suicide prevention plan it should be released publicly in the next couple of weeks. This is late and push it out. Hello. Hey is in part of these discussions we get asked quite a lot. I the check in this is related to the quick we are finding SP ten oh four. SP ten of four has a couple of. One is to direct them to give the counties directing that to priority. P. I've thanks ten for the programs to the extent that. Come with us they are counties the option of deviating from that list. It also asked the commission to establish a framework for evaluating PI. Part of the challenge we have is that if he recognized our our traditional primary secondary and tertiary prevention modalities borrowing from the public health model and you apply that to the broader. Issues that P. E. identifies from from homelessness and involved. How long suffering it's very difficult to say how do we value wait a strategy when IT such with this such a broad array of intersections between primary secondary tertiary and these domains. Where the commission is today is we've night. California I think that Max shared understand what prevents. The mental health space. Between the at sign. An HSA riding if we take. Work the. Issues that are touched upon and then and then look at them through that primary. A lot. The process of engaging the World Health Organization ten yeah National Academy of sciences and others to begin at this question. Can't how can we begin to create a shared framework for understanding what prevention means and mental health. Through which we can begin to identify. Principles for making decisions about how to prioritize. The much broader town. That had deployed. Since he I'm a county I think there are based on the work done with the county is the conversation that we've had with our research experts and other partners there are some things that that we could that California could do that you could do to strengthen the strategy around funding allocations- for example we've counties that have been they have been required to return CSS fun. Because they felt like. tools that they are. They'd like to shift the I. but they can't. Actually which are there are no more unmet needs that those domains for disturbing disturbing these dollars get set aside and the legislature can re imagine what that distribution looks like that language was envisioned for estate why prop. Right and that when all needs are met each county can that that. An example I guess it was a- research indicates they serve everybody who's eligible for CSS dollars but they can't actually reallocate those dollars Intel LA and San Diego in Orange County and everybody else is in the same spot so there are some opportunities we think that that could lead to some. The case CSS that- set aside for F. S. P. actually has been met. But but short of that it's very early for us in in all the literature that we've had in all the effort that we've talked about. Think about. How to pick what's the best cost of that prevent. Find Sierra orange in LA with that I'd I'd be happy to respond any questions you might have and I want to thank you again for the opportunity thank you Tony and- next we have Kelly Pfeiffer and will return for questions at the end of the path okay better employment staff thank you so much it's a- honor to be here. Any moment in time in California. Racial opportunity to change. Because the moment like this where the governor the administration. See the latest. Of. We have this unique moment in time with the medical waiver for men. Thank as saying you know what can we do about this particular waiver the other saying what is the Medicare program in the future look like and what would America from look. Really delivered on behavioral health outcomes and overall care outcomes and that's what my colleague Brenda I'm really should be talking about. And also on this this MHSAA as much as we focus on a visit aren't working having practiced in other states it's incredible. To sing in a to. Work in a state where. These services can be. Either way. Friends are we bring in. Your may I brief testimony some. Ready about. He agreed with mers I can set some all star. These are the we're going to see a different center. Loves to read we'll help business to making sure we're not putting our people with mental illness and substance use disorder instructional justice system and really take care of our high risk kids and what's interesting about PI- in particular damage as well as you can really see. Townies. In this work we do have is state what I'd metrics and being able to quantitatively to distort. Robust evaluations and you'll see some real impressive results but we can't yet tell that story at the statewide level of my department's committed to that. And. The third team- it just about making sure as we face the work we do rate what works. Reflect in a couple a few ways that an HSA NPI has its frame now is making an impact on. These populations Amir stammer talked about- you know first in terms of criminal justice a- full service part. There's a bit of us to evaluation Toby against did was. As in people and they have. A full service partnerships and I'm people but it's been a program had half the arrest afterwards as they did before and if you look at the subpopulation with frequent arrest those of that restaurant we went down by two thirds. And those who are homeless arrest weightless I have no we do have a statewide. Story to tell about service partnerships I think is important remember. And then what P. of corpses in. Where is says within the program cannot reduce income and equities and housing costs but we can intervene at that critical moment in time before someone loses their housing. And prevent them from ending up in the criminal justice system are of with homelessness. And then there's the other population of high risk kids many of the programs you'll see. Five into the- hi only a few days with diction and make sure that that doesn't. Happen county welfare program because no outcome is better by foster care so as we can king family there. Again okay- we change it to say let's protect what works I'm a just a few questions on my own departments- work around Pete as you know the work how old. Work with news we do fiscal oversight making sure that the spending the county matches the three year plan that their- is. To have the prudent reserves to make sure that as we have recessions that were able to continue the programming and we do program oversight as well including on site reviews- working with to make each come. MHM. Is done well and if they need for corrective action. Working with that county and I'm also great to the procedures you provided us. To have I have to do more techno. Since it. To make him a- I do want to be honest about the challenges and I think I'll close with that have. You I'm glad we can have a specific panel on on statewide goals and metrics because- we really do have. An impact I pray. And by setting ourselves some goals and then working with the counties many a county. Things that matter that measure that are really impactful as Michelle had mentioned- but we had don't yet tell that story at the statewide level. Am I due a refund when that is that is the best part of an HSA is this local flexibility in the local control because. We are able to represent tumors in families in planning because then. You know we are not the needs of LA is said. Then that flexibility is a real challenge when it comes to innovation fund because some of the best innovations are when you were first follower Nanda so the first time to do something but taking a with. Ex and spreading across the state and so. Lots of reading work happening around the psychosis mentioning that. For kids. You get the men within two weeks and if you're waiting a few years. It was mentioned but of people with mental illness self medicating with substances and a working how lame is trying to recognize that these clean lines we used to see between substance use disorder and mental illness or not so clean anymore and when especially young people present was psychosis as a family doctor it's a it's a futile exercise to try to say is this because there's like- because they're using math we- people where we are. To beat Pete telling a- especially with kids the street is a. To work in a state that's invested. So heavily in the care of their most vulnerable with the band and. During the many people and we haven't made a film kept. But we can do better portal called on the table to. Thank you. Members when it's Ralph when visiting the sailors office as you may know back in Feb or two thousand eighteen we should report on the funding and oversight of the mental health services act and found significant challenges. That prevented the effective use of. But it period of eleven twelve through fifteen sixteen one of the main issues we found was that health service. Oversight of the counties and use of the funds was not effective. Purses did not fired guidance to counties regarding how to spend that much safe fun and it was lacking in its ability to oversee what how if the funds are spent appropriately. This concerns on oversight allowed to hundreds of dollars to spend every. That could have been re giver. Okay back to other counties so they could be used to provide those services. Port debt of nearly three hundred ninety million dollars as July seventeen that was subject reversion. The state law did at the in act one time change a two thousand seventeen that'll locals to retain those funds. A group plan on. What was our concern that health. Not this stylish no plane river. Says has established a reversion process- for reverting unspent funds to it up to the counter and then out reallocated back to the counties. The thing. We. Also concerned with was with the level of image say funds that the counties. In receptors. A lot but so far the appropriate reserve level we've always held reserves. Five hundred and thirty five million dollars. Which was reserve will pull of a proxy 4% or else is identify most reserve what about 33% which would have freed up a hundred and fifty seven million dollars in additional funding they could have been used for mental service says- since our audit in two thousand eighteen the legislator. Legislator in SP one nine two amended state law I captopril reserve a 33% Again this is something that was important. Edits also we noted that SP one ninety to clarify that. The in. P. C. A. S. we humbly dot in unsafe. Of interest that had just been a key. Yes but interest falls principle this could offer. To be. Force structure. And of levels will help ensure that the candies actually spend the money and not just a mass hundred million dollars in unspent funds. We also noted so positive approved Paul the day. Since since we- interactive image say transparency database on its public website that provides financial and informational information on the state programs among the tables you can review and compare eventually funded programs a key characteristics such as target populations budgets and program goals. Including prevention and early intervention funds- this was something that available. That's set up. Understanding of where the funding is good. Been approved of that information was available at the county levels but you have to go through report after report and I don't think that's something that the average person was doing now that's available publicly with thing that's a positive thing. We all did that at the time a report the counties were. Not providing their annual revenue expenditure reports on time. Matter of fact at the twelve and these were. It reported some he health care services has established a process them. To withhold 25% of actual of annual. At current county finally. I do also want to mention that we do have a current auto involving images Hey although we cannot see. Letterman pitcher short act LPS- regarding the in treatment for resources for patients or involuntarily held- the scope of this because I would you say is the primary funding source for county mental services. The audit will touch or may touch upon funding and out. Existing programs in counties so that report is US scheduled to release in April twenty twenty. The concludes my remarks. And I'm available for any questions thank you Sir next we have doctor Eberhart. I'm in the first panel on my rand corporation colleagues and I have been paying sixty three. I programming for over eight years I will use some of the things from these evaluations to inform some of the questions posed to this panel. You pose the question this California need a larger and- did not directly. Funding level for P. I. investments. However our valuation findings to provide at. The I. programs are beneficial and that investing in PI. In your stream cost savings for the state. With respect to benefits be found that Los Angeles county. My server is and so our men's community engagement pain in the county that's fully engaged in people and- how to get help for a mental problem. At the state level we found that P. I. campaign is worse give use much. On this. Pulse services. Then to intervene with those at risk for suicide these are just a few of the benefits I. Buy our evaluations. We also found evidence at St P. I. programs yield it up. That's meant by leading a cop says this man. Yes he did with financially beneficial outcomes such as higher productivity earnings and employment programs that reduce suicide rate potential to return large amounts of money to the state. The reverted medic how healthcare costs. The times and priest income tax revenue from all her life thanks again. Angel benefit is that our list of cost. It is important to provide a full continuum of mental health care. Early chin to treatment for those serious mental illness spending on prevention can be controversial. When there are so many seriously mentally ill people and their needs. But the value to support the next guy. Entry incompetent they are both spectrum of mental health services. You ask to ensure the state limit the P. I. options for counties based on best practices. Well I know that look tension county and the cow may sit stay away yeah I put. Have carefully chosen event. This is an- elevations of these pro. Deed indicated that they are effective in the diverse and vulnerable populations served in California. Although many evidence PI practices are available. Counties in the state could consider using a small letter practices. But in a support. Implemented in the populations for which it is intended and delivered in a manner intended but it is not feasible to monitor how a large number of practice is are being administered. This thing on a smaller subset a practice. Easier to ensure they are administered as intended and yield the did Rick. Since he is particularly if he's collaborate on investments in training monitoring out by you with. Were there are trade offs given how did California is on the- take. The county's engage in counties also need to delete to tailor the implementation of evidence based practices to the unique local needs and populations although there are advantages to why the implementing a smaller number of evidence based practices there in line with statewide goals any effort to streamline option should consider counties needs. To be responsive to local stakeholders. What challenges have counties face in spending their prop sixty three finds well I certainly won't go up on this issue given that our evaluations did not directly address spending challenges and the other panelists here certainly better equipped to weigh in. But I am aware that some counties have not been spending out their P. I. dollars which might give the impression that the funds are not needed. However some county support that they have trouble spending P. I. funds because the funding stream is viewed as not being flexible enough to meet their needs. For instance county state that the time frame in which funds need to be spent makes it pulled you stop and launch. A new program. In counties may still have some. Yeah hi I just say. Challenging. And accountability how lex ability in using P. I find. I appreciate having the opportunity to weigh in today based on my experience as an evaluator of prop sixty three funded program since twenty eleven in the interest of time I try to keep my comments today focused with limited examples very but my ran colleagues and I have written eighty reports relevant to prop sixty three over the past eight years. And I would be happy to answer questions about our work today or at a later point in time. Thank you again. He tapped. Thank you doctor Dr read the two of them. They aren't my homework read them all. There is a top. I the specifics that sounds great I'm but before I begin wanted off a similar refrigeration. Just anybody on the panel so we look at the P. A. is there an integration. With the locals constraint is expelled when you look days in the schools and we talk about early. In. My understanding is that there is that the schools just knowing ministers to the ID population and we have. Ways to college counselors so we have this. Set of children that are not supported by a mental health aspect to it. Thank you up legislation just been passed. But it's still going through the part of education on how it's supposed to be implemented is there a collaborator could her. Are there because it's being gullible to administer to children. To phase. There are lot example counties collaborating with schools- Alameda county has a very aggressive program of using their P. E. I. finds through their schools Sam. Plaster county I'm less certainly Los Angeles and I think you Michelle might have tells. Only made a commitment and the directors here if you can talk about that a parting with their schools. I am a few years ago. Mission set aside a portion of our SPD two funds in order to incentivize these partnerships and- more than a third of the counties stepped up to the plate. And applied we were unable to provide funds to all of those counties some counties indicated they wanted to they didn't have the capacity to go. Through the application process that led to the passage of the mental health student services act. X. I'm. To do that there is had. That would get in the way of school in county partnerships however as you heard there are some rules and there are some restrictions in and what we find. Is that the will is often there but what's missing is the house. In that these partners can struggle and how to cook how to collaborate because of differences in culture because of training rules- often- miss sender endings of the vagaries of hip and verba. Fat both federal policies that restrict it and sharing. Same time their tents from throughout the state. Sure pull the information out of those examples I think what you heard from the auditor with reference to the transparency informational website. Is there's more out there than we can keep track of but what we want to do. Eight experts best to be able to learn from their peers and so I would say yes it is happening. All over the state but it is not happening in every community and every school. Today a major. Cool county health and school districts in almost every county throughout the state what we don't have is the scale so that in every school site you have a county behavioral health partnership. And what I've learned from folks is that there are several- years to this one as their explicit mandate. We've done a lot of work. Partnership putting the map the budget- which Toby just referenced but the other piece is- you know you have to have willing partners on both sides and- on I would say that you know right now the best way that we can approach this is by trying to organize a pot luck of financing where everybody is a little bit. Into the bowl- of all children in California our medic how eligible the other for not and fix. The car. Want a screening for insurance when a student comes through the door. Needing services and so we have to figure out a way to account for that half of the population that is not medic hal reimbursable so that's one kind of structural barriers. Or issue that we need to get to- the other piece to your excellent point is that there are. School be based at mental health or behavioral health support providers in schools today who are really trained in oriented around helping students be prepared to learn and to achieve their educational goal and I want to be really clear. That the V. work that we're putting forward. About supplementing those Sir it's not I. Am replacing being replaced by them it's a different. Service talk. Kenny behavioral health then in need for us to ever going to really get to this population based prevention model of median children in families where they're at and you know after the age of five I it is Dr I'm black kids don't. Time. In the pediatrician's office- you know my daughter so excited she she does they're back couple years. And so unless you get sick we don't go to the doctor- and but where kids are is in school and where their- issues are likely to be getting surface through behavioral issues in the classroom and so you know we're already seeing the results of this and yes- are Fresno county directors here and she's got a fence sick model in place but- they're- much more we could do is this. Aston tools- schools also have very limited space available for one on one behavioral health sections and so that's another kind of structural issue. But we can get over those hurdles- if we really. Have a will to double down on this. Piece of the continuum. And so but soon it is simply to think about charters. To know K. twelve need to think be thinking about those this pre K. opportunities as well- but the opportunities are also there for those students that were serving their community colleges who often vulnerable. Because of poverty and other kinds of issues but also there are you. I had some conversations with universe. System about what we can build some collaborative partnerships between K. and that the campus. Also those places with a lots of expensive areas of expertise particulars campuses at that have health systems and so we really are trying to facilitate the kinds of parts of that you're talking about and I would say the peace that that that really encourage you to think about is the T. is the technical assistance pace. It it it can be very difficult for asking people to change their behavior to change how they spend money to share risk for institutions that have historically competed with each other right they go they go before you well then they say every dollar that goes into health is a dollar that's not available for education or vice versa and now we're trying to say we have to win. To actually leverage bow. I appreciate that. But if he- ever was made for you say that the most. Effective this can occur. Where they are in in in mass you know when we talk about. Early education home what a child could feel comfortable about reaching out about anxiety about other issues about. Anything that has about a mental health component that it's okay the stigma can be removed and that there. Well to reach out to that individual on site to get the help. Because I mean kids can be me. And it starts right snowballing and so I'm just hoping that we can. Start a- start a process through the health class whatever it is. That we have that. Dialogue with that each individual student saying. Okay if you're feeling anxiety or if you're feeling suicidal if you're feeling what ever. Talk to social. Back in the day what does a school we had that counselor. Okay the kids today don't have those counselors on site. And a lot of my schools. And so we called the trainers. Has the ID population is supported you know and- I think that we need to be able to. Look at the collaboration from the mental health experts with. Be a part of education. And collaborate how we can better advance billionaire intervention and education- to be able to have. That. Santa Barbara CM and not orange enter a Kern sounds of this percent of our a and deal that we had a over a hundred fifty high school age students who came together for and mental health division I. The university of California Santa Barbara. What they groups with some adult allies but very much you've driven- almost to a one they identified the need for a safe place on campus where young people could decompress relax could seek help right they they propose bean bags in hand next hanging chair. In open plan it's a new things you need to do to create a safe place for young people but very consistent with with with with your observation that's what young people said that they need in their counties- the outcome of that we hope is that the counties that were in the room heard from their use as part of a community planning process what we want to do is bring those counties together to say how to make that happen. So they don't reinvent the wheel how do we begin to remove some of the barriers to making that happen how do we do the education there S. identify funding streams you can. Use that matches the innovation funds that you can use P. E. I. for the- other sources of funds- but it's complicated it's difficult. Again because oftentimes these are not. That have done this and so we're really trying to build a partnership for doing to more of the fifth generation labs all focus on school middle off so I think. Your comments are very consistent with with what we're hearing from young people all of. Posted there. Also look at the private insurers and figure out how we can hold them accountable for. That summer social safety net and- yes- towards early interventions and prevention's I think it's an important part of the conversation but I wanted to come back if I could to- mayor Steinberg's comments regarding. Whether there were efficiencies and focusing early interventions and. I come at it trying to figure out if there is a way for us to. Either sent a virus or encouraged and types of programs so that we could have collaboration at a statewide level. I look towards the early psychosis as an example of one of those types of programs without again trying to be overly prescriptive. With any specific proposal but simply if that county was having issues with a certain metric trying to meet T. their trauma or child welfare system. Could we have a learning collaborative could we have similar to the end. Later that we have that could be helpful in allowing counties tell learn best practices from other counties. Wondering if you had a calming you are describing the state of the MHSAA today and. What I would say is that you know on early psychosis at has been a focus there how. Fast it. MHM on with some federal grants but. Referring to my we have early psychosis programs in more than half of our counties either up or into mensa thirty five out of five fifty eight counties early psychosis programs not see here but probably doesn't make sense to put one okay. I'm just this from my first his. We are knocking the part and the learning collaborative's are really an opportunity for the clinicians to get together and talk like clinical practice what's working and what's not. We are tailoring early psychosis intervention so we lifted one up in one county and found that for the largely immigrant monolingual Spanish speaking population that they were supposed to be serving the provider was not. Hitting the target they had English speaking clinicians they were not meeting the place where they were at culturally- linguistically we modified the program we said do over we need to a retailer this program so that meets the needs of this particular community in geography. That's exactly what we should be doing on early psychosis and I think you know it's early days because the field is kind of early. Days. Really laugh sting. I'm I think the question then becomes. Those other kind of more home grown types of innovations that we're implementing where to. We open. Up the space for clients and we say tell us how you want to be done tell us how you get and they tell us do we not. Move for some of these other. You know more pointed north star star type of goal. And. Then we just need your full be we've read. And some space. Create an evidence based around community defy diss that otherwise wouldn't be available we're not perfect it's not you know I won't say that there isn't room for improvement in terms of- all all of the various dimensions of diversity. Being out do not reflect the populations that we need to serve in California and those are areas where we could make targeted investments in different ways from a workforce development standpoint- but and we also need to be mindful that are talked to by- psycho social model and so it's not all about clinical part right some of this stuff for the people for medical model for may feel kinda squishy but it might be just as if not more effect of it getting to where they need to be in terms of their recovery. And so I think- you know yes some focus is helpful because maybe it'll give folks more confidence in the work that we're doing but in terms of some of the specific exam were given. All our response. That's what we're doing right now today in something. It may feel like it's not enough like on the school based tips right we're not in every school. Comes a girly side assist. A foreign at in right now New York doing pretty well as well but they're small I hear what you're Sir. You know I was. Troubled I think is the best word can by the auditor had any set oversights currently not active that me and went through two fifteen and sixteen. But and we have done quite a bit in the recent budgets that will help us to ensure adequate. Reserves as well as counties ability to be able to spend within their three plans. But I'm trying to. Really look at this as. A resource to limit and we. The dollars we have and- I tend to focus looking now cops now I've actually been moved a bit by brands who. Reminds a we are people who are seeking care who receive the care and aren't just numbers and how important it is for us to look at the whole person within this discussion. But my fear is we do have limited resources and how do we. Effectively apply. This discussion. The currently occurring at the county wide level. Okay I'm on its side it's make. Us better on the whole we welcome accountability in for you each of the lines they tend. Going into this new role knowing that our team is working hard to address them that the- revision process was implemented this last round of revisions was less than 1% of the total budget so we see counties really stepping up- and doing the work to make sure the funds are spent responsibly- the reserve. Issue clearly was an issue and now that we have the legislation capping reserves there's a plan to make sure that each county. Goes down to that reserve level curse. Clear and if they got the L. A. C. could you. On the phone AS teach CS the command to modern their data. Brand before but then we and I think we're gonna be better five years from now than where we are now- the lateness of the- ari ours has been resolved a I- it turns out when you withhold money that people. Work in on time I don't think it's the only mechanism that this the store closes counties. It should be during the case I think it worked and we look forward. To an ecstatic. M. chair you may. Take because this work and I just wanted to point out and it might be the nice transition to the next panel. Is that project started with building a data foundation. For the early psychosis programs building off of the New York model actually and we recently brought. The folks from NIMH and from ontrack New York to Sacramento. In partnership with them some of the different administration and counties- but a hundred fifty people. To look at that model but I won't. Say that I'm- thanks to me we're trying to get done where we have a model how do we implemented with fidelity to the point that rand is making. How do we build the agreement across providers in terms of the data that we're collecting and analyze that in a way that uniform. So that we can tell the press the individual story the programmatic story and the statewide story and the intent is that we do have a statewide system over. The services that are available to everybody including Sierra county even though Sierra county may not operate a program through regional approaches to that collaboration. And I do think that is where California's farthest along in terms of building out the infrastructure. Again data data data right and that can lead to the kinds of. And ten other read. So push us to move towards the most cost effective the most efficient care because we can begin to look at how quickly as doctor fiver says the two week engagement versus the two year engagement what does that mean in terms of proving educational outcomes reducing. On reducing its involvement well if we can do that for this eco system we do that in. Their component. And I do believe that is a- way into our third panel thank you. So you don't this is a. Okay yeah well then I won't. Go into the thought about it. Your view of the. Yeah thank you for any. Do you. This is. Do it. Well we but I think you're- a little bit. Yeah okay. You know. I'm leaving I'm just taking. We will begin our third panel on transformation the alchemists based director you talked. Yeah in chair and members- you take the behavioral health director in Fresno county and a special- greeting to my assembly member and a doctor were ambulance. A county behavior health directors support a movement away from MHS state funded programs are built around finding percentages and instead moving toward accountability for outcomes because we also want to know how do we use data science and outcomes measurement to improve people's lives rather than show compliance with rules and regulations. Which were pretty good act counties today collect the men. And use that as a programmatic into. It extensively by the best research institutions throughout the state you've heard from brand UCLA and UC Berkeley have also done studies of some of our programs. To understand of our efforts are working. And often they are. Are full service partnership model which has been repeatedly- evaluated has demonstrated to work for reducing hospitalizations emergency room visits incarceration and homelessness. All of which are important. Goals for the people we serve the problem. Transparency place. We. Counties in the event. Ending but the structure of the funding which is built around both aspirational goals as well as in fast funding percentages with categorical. Grant programs within those has not served us well allocations the percent yes that community this is. It works even less well in small counties which have to be more integrated and we're 20% of a small overall image as say allotment is a really small amount as an example I'll give you. Alpine county which has a population of one thousand one hundred compared to my county which is a little over a million- the MHSAA allotment for two thousand and seventeen was two hundred and seventy five thousand dollars. Total to meet all of the program thank and regulatory requirements which have been laid out by the state. Another important point is that there are often not clean lines between the components for example we have innovations which are also prevention and early intervention. Focused and there's been historically blurred lines between what constitutes P. E. I. in CSS due to a lack of clear guidance at times from the state. Rather than get hung up and ensuring compliance with funding percentages we believe we should a wind around the goals that Californians want to achieve. One important note is that as a county behavior health director I wear multiple hats. Which need to be considered when we develop outcomes we are part public behavioral health part departments we are a medical specialty mental health plan were an insurance company. And we also deliver direct services are oversee the direct- provision of services and we are 1100% accountable to our local communities and their stakeholders. Based on this unique perspective I offer the following for efforts to shift away from the funding buckets to a system based on accountability for outcomes. Any outcomes we develop need to be measurable based on available data and reflect not just the over arching statewide goals for MHSAA but need to reflect local priorities as well and stakeholder needs. We can't have a one size fits all approach for example we know that suicide rates in California's rural northern counties are much higher than the rest of the state and might need different approaches. We want to move to a population health based model. And the more restrictive and categorical we get with our funding particularly for prevention it really turns into not a prevention program but a fail first program you have to be homeless for to meet your needs you have to be in the involved in the criminal justice is. Pressed to meet your needs as opposed to a true public health type prevention program which is for our one. The MHSAA propose outcomes also need to be aligned with the rest of our funding. An HSA represents just 20% of the full statewide investment in public behavior health spending and it's only a quarter of most counties behavior health budgets. This means that the rest of medic cow as well as funding for homelessness education in criminal justice system should be aligned with the outcomes goals that we do determine. Along the same lines as a has been mentioned previously two thirds of Californians are covered by private insurance. Not medic cal so to the degree that we are seeking to prevent those individuals from becoming so severely mentally ill that they qualify for county behavior health services. And by the way I have parents contact me regularly finding out how they can get their kids off their insurance in inter county behavioral health services. The state along me. Lawmakers need to ask for increased accountability for those plans as well. We recommend an approach where a body of experts which include clients family members representatives of county behavioral health. And doubt us to come together with the state. To assess available down and did. Post white outcomes- if we should not write it into an initiative- we need to be able to- make. As flexible respond to emergent public health needs and improvements in data collection a measurement science so as we learn things. People to change the outcome. Bond to that- and by writing it in it just made a costly and inefficient to make any changes- county behavior health directors but- strongly that we should allow for the majesty of find services for individuals with the primary S. U. decent diagnosis. Often hard to get in under. That at the. Underlying mental illness when some struggle a deck and. Ideas move individuals away from is it. Safe whether it's in jails impatient for a cycling in enough homelessness allow. Flux lady to deal with what I reckon. But in our. Use this much were swept in that progress. Given the complexity of the variables were dealing with and the breadth of the scope of our work accountability should come in the form of technical assistance training and investment to drive improved quality and outcomes throughout the state understanding that California's diverse communities will require us to embrace differences based on population speeds. Finally it's a bit surprising to me that we've barely touched on the concept of the. Massive amount a lack of affordable housing in cal. I could not our obligation to serve the homeless population. And we will not solve homelessness unless those in a position of authority are accountable for addressing. The need for affordable housing in our state we cannot stick our head in the sand. And that we're simply going to solve. The first show that we have. Ninety days in with very full shelters that filled up within a couple of weeks these are people you know we typically hear from. A lot of our local elected officials not you doctor. The. The homeless on our street in front so housed in yeah the shelter. Days they're not. The ability to get a lease on mon for very sinister reason. The housing for them and sub what to them until they can build a rental history- we have other programs have gotten three no. Place like home awards that we're working on but still- into account those in authority has a waiting list of forty to fifty thousand people. Need a portable housing. Got dressed that issue in California or we will not solve homelessness. We see the outcomes and how we've been able to transform individual lives- you heard a little bit and mention of our schools program- that program became operational in January of this year and we're already seeing. Three and four fold increases in access to mental health in our rural areas- with the advent of our schools partnership. In that program prevention and early intervention. Used to Kate school. Teacher things like. Impact on. Regulation the impact on adult responses to student behavior and strategies for D. aesculap E. de escalating behavior including verbal strategies and environmental supports- they're teaching mindfulness and developing trauma response of class rooms- and we are getting referrals not just to tell. Kids who insurance right the most and poor school district. Some of the riffs wells were from kids with an insurance screened in with mental health it is a hub and spoke model. Services in schools they can get services in the hub as well as in the community and in their home and we are providing services to charter schools as well it's a five year rollout in alternately every school in Fresno county will have access to that program- we're engaging in learning collaborative's you heard mentioned the- psychiatric advance directive Fresno in Monterey or taking the lead on that we want the people we serve. To have a role in determining- even the response to them during a crisis and we're really looking forward to that work- but it's still not enough as we don't really have a single aggregator or entity responsible for the evaluation of the effectiveness of. Graham. Directors of said loud and clear we are ready to demonstrate. Ability the outcomes put before us we just need more flexibility and the right set of measures to harness the strengths of our unique public behavioral health system. Thank you for the opportunity to address the committee and I'm happy to answer any question. Thank you director you talked to viewing. Thank you again to be doing on behalf of the mental health services over some kind of a commission. Know that the original nineteen ninety one realignment. Was structured where the funding would. So the lot tremendous amount of flex. In exchange for tents on out. Away from that man it leaves the state side in the sense that we struggled to identify this key metrics although we have them- in many instances they're not regularly use for example the budget process or or to shape. Policy discussions it's the same time. We have not made the center. In her with the L. S. comments in the right. Haitian you're aware with leave presented on the commission's work to make information available on finding on programs and outcomes. And so we're making some progress we are working with the department to get today. Tax dollars in revenues in nature. Than funds I deeply that we need to stand on the fuller picture. Of finding. Who highlight or shame those counties that are spending dollars that's not the issue at all this too is to actually resource the communities that are doing planning is to help them understand what options are available how much money do you have to spend what's on the table and recognizing the damages say is 20% overall but in some communities it's more than that it's twenty five or thirty or forty percent. Of the counties funding we ought to look at the other five that are available to ask. This question. Missed opportunities dried up the kinds of analyses that we need to be able to do in terms of funding the programs pieces the second part of our transparency effort and again that is to help people understand what's out there as a given county. To understand who's doing well what. The most common health program in which to help. I'm more need there then we can accommodate at the moment this strategy of helping the public and helping stakeholders understand what's in place today who they're surveying and how and how impactful I think is the foundational piece to really. Move the state towards outcomes it means crowdsourcing at a now that's about on healthcare this is. What what city is here and it's okay can do. Simple he said that the out. Mentioned earlier to but the FSP data and we're saying he never can- improvements in reducing criminal justice involvement but that's at a tiny area. Very tiny area we are currently investing. In understanding how to link school data with mental health data so we can understand the impact that these kinds of programs have on children and families. We're trying to work the eighty day to link mental health and employment data we want to work with the SS ensemble for data we have an active contact with UCLA to skin all of the data sets that are available to help. States and other countries are actually measuring performance for mental health and they've given us some preliminary information on a couple of the P. E. I. comes but the intent is to actually build out those metrics and begin to report. Ways that really shaped. This broad public accountability in in on we get out. In a lot. Of teams. Have been forced. Side of thirty that we have is the ability. To see the dialogue just to communicate to the public what's working what's not. But we have to put with that a strategy to move from not king to what working. We lose that hope. And that that's in the public so you know consistent this I think. It thank. We could move more effectively in and we could move more expansively. If consist with the alley if the infrastructure were in place I don't think. Start with. What we need to do. Data we have in through that process. If there's the. Visit the you that require. So you know I'd I would love to talk to you some more about steps that we could take am I certainly wouldn't want to go fast or too big because this is. Complicated stuff I will say that we are farther along. Than most other states. A couple of pockets. Psicosis work in New York. And the mental health field is farther along than just about any other area of public investment. We know a lot about transportation right but when it comes to health care in the complexity of a system like this. We actually have greater transparency around dollars and programs and outcomes than in most of the public program hello. And so it. Pratt that we collectively have made even though we have to make much more thank you thank you- telling him is trying to focus some of the efforts on reducing or some of the redundant reports and so I do think there's an effort and I would like to. Lot guarding maybe there are ways within the state cap that we can. Focus or assist you in data collection but we will follow up cut off line. Next we have doctor five for. Greater will be quite brief visit when echo some of the things I heard from Toby mean transparency is a powerful chip. In my career and family medicine and the army you can change how we practice space. But I hate. The other. One of the biggest malls Peter is there are and if you can create standardized metrics we can see how you're performing. On the transparencies powerful so Hey I can see that we collect a lot of data and we don't. We could do a better job of making an intimate confirmation and I think that's what our- team for. He says this. At ten ten many counties core data formats we don't have an electronic waited- synthesize it counties are different in their geography of their population size their demographics and their work force in their programming and the work we're doing in the department of trying to integrate different data sources as part of our overall data modernization effort is slow and painful and I wish I could go faster but I can tell you we're committed. To doing that. I'm data press P. even as I was before we don't have great attention. And so we do if you are part goals set the Cup come down from our governor's office and our agency I think would be a great time deciding on what performance out. Match so the most meaningful. That can also collected given without adding additional work force these are decisions. Your name we've got a very real take a process because we do. The answers and so I think this would be one of those things that we would need to do. Collectively. We do have a great opportunity in the innovation fund and as I mentioned before. Bulls to not to look is what looks. Tell you take there's a lot. The firm proof read. The county try to figure out something that's brand new from scratch how do you take well have. Spread them and really be. Sure it works. Thank you five. Hello brand from non. Afternoon Jeremy let members of the subcommittee- my name is Angela brown and I'm here on behalf of nami California. Is that better yes. Our name is Angela Brandon I'm here on behalf of nami California we are the statewide affiliate of the country's largest mental health advocacy organization- the National Alliance on mental illness- are nineteen thousand members and sixty two affiliates include many people with serious mental illnesses their families loved ones and supporter. When the MHSAA was passed in two thousand four it was done because of so much work the dedicated advocates consumers and family members some of which are here in the room today. And it was then and still is a really remarkable thing for community mental health. It promised to transformation the mental health system from crisis. Driven to one that's focused on prevention and wellness expanding so close previously I heard population. Recovering empowerment spurred this cultural shift in the way that we think about. How. And it's through that that leasing and have more choice and- a and the door. Decisions that affect them than ever before. But we're challenged because we don't know what the impact of the billions of dollars that have been infused into the system. Has been. As shared by. Many of the folks here today on this panel in the previous panels. We can't adequately determine the and. Free hands of pulp come data about weather and- and safety programs have light proving before his lives. As we move for. Is I mean form must be the implementation of collection analysis and broad dissemination of image as a program outcomes. Right now there's no formal requirement of any of the custodial partners of the MHSAA to provide a report to the legislature on the status of the outcome in progress toward achieving I mean **** urban healthcare services does collect and provide reports on refugee. Revenue and expenditure reports- we don't have anything that really describes the impact on people and our state the whole- we would recommend that specific and measurable benchmarks and goals be determined and sat over time. And that they are based on the current statutory purpose of the image as a prevention and early intervention programs. That are attending. T. reductions in suicide incarceration. About unemployment prolong suffering homelessness remote little from their homes. And we ignite that you. Have shared that's an incredibly complex thing to do a lot of our section. That is a lot lamb and when which not everything fits sleep talks on that is the one thing that is really missing from our ability to meaningfully tell the story of how image as a is impacted. Communities and without that. Any refresh or in or reconsideration would be premature. Our organization did submit a letter to the subcommittee- I won't read that to you but I will sort of touch on some of our priority issues those are that statewide and local an HSA funded programs must be Klein and family driven- an HSA funds should not be diverted away from direct support of. This is to pay. And somehow. We've heard. From there about housing- there in. Exit program agencies tasked with dressing doesn't. It this compares statements I mean housing is more than just a place to live there's- a huge consideration for income equality in income inequality and all of the other factors that are. Leading folks on the street. Not just to healthy. It's just a fun spent on housing should assure clients caregivers and family members have access to a variety of thing assistance as their needs change over time. A fund should not be diverted to supply. It's for the treatment of housing needs of individuals with a history of criminal justice system contacts. Fund should not be diverted to supplant other entities responsibilities for children and youth who could benefit from additional mental health screening and treatment. And we've heard that. We know that their successes with the full service partnership programs and we feel strongly that a large majority of I mean just a French spent on. Community support and service should be required to implement. Partners testing for clients. It's available online as mentioned through the only see their set. Of transparency tools- you know for the first time. Ever I think it's. Builders to access what funding is available on the counter what's that some programs are being provided and- toward more direction when I got. But that's just where. We're not quite that. What we like as a cohesive and comprehensive effort to take that date until the meaningful story business my action or Dino words were more than just the date and we're more than just the numbers you know we are the successes and we are the challenges and we find a way to tell that story together. So please keep conversations continue the consideration must be made to develop a prop. That considers the future of image to say. Three more US robust effort to encourage our stakeholder community- that nothing about us without us. Is no something to put on a button or wearing a tee shirt not really. Hard content of the MHSAA and to move ahead with considerations on how to refresh this that needs to be done. Including the views of the folks at the MHSAA means the most to clients and family members- and we encourage you not doing it at a Amanda was well there are a lot of folks around the state. Although here in the capital of mine. It's hard to get here for a number of reasons- so we just only encourage that the process purposefully seeks their feedback- because this is critical to ensuring that whatever happens with the M. is done in partnership with the community it's on hand in hand with consumer and family members. Which is the engine in the hallmark of the MHSAA and- I thank you for giving me the opportunity to share with you today in. I'm available for thank you miss Brandt next we have found the car. Noon. And members of the committee thank you for having me here today. My name is Karen Vick I am the policy director for cal voices formally known as nor cal MHA. We are the oldest pure run mental health advocacy organization in California all of our sixty plus employees personally identify as consumers and or family members in addition we have thirty access ambassadors in every region of the state to provide local Casey in their counties and at the state level. And that's through our MHS so it. Did I'm access ram. I have this mental. How main points that I would like to discuss today number one- California's is truly believes that the M. HSA does not need to be changed or refreshed it's simply needs to be enforced. Number. Number two with each current can see can changes. Not mine. Is the altering the M. HSA and number three I'm going to echo Angela clients in consumers must be treated as a sexual partners and all discussions regarding proposed changes to the M. HSA. Out something that director eutectic point. At yeah to a lack of affordable housing not mental illness a twenty seventeen study by hood found that only 26% of homeless people nationwide live with mental illness we also know that homelessness can cause mental illness. We don't know the numbers there but we can be pretty sure. Fewer than 26% of the homeless population live at the mental yes at the time of. Yes so I that's what I've heard please don't derail MHSAA money for an affordable housing issue if seventy more than 76% of homeless people do not even have a mental illness. Comments we're we're hearing comments today about the need for statewide performance outcomes of a focus on specific populations statewide guidance on priorities for the M. HSA. To say was written and passed back in. Two thousand four. To address all of these issues. Missy. For Smith of the act. We've been hearing today all. We've. Been hearing about how successful FS PSR and his bees. Thirty one ship it is 60% in homelessness of. Emergency stop the highly effective AB thirty for a beat. All which would. Posit out. And I have some code sections that that I think have been sort of- code sections of the image as say that have been sort of. Beef. Well for institutions code section fifty eight I've. The V. eight in design. The joint plan for a coordinated evaluation of client outcomes in the unity based mental health system. The California services services AT and similarly the- the section fifty eight forty C. three year plan shell clued reports on the pavement performance outcomes for services funded by the process. And established. Jointly each CS and the only see and collaborate CB a thank. And there's no more I can bore you with code sections. But I do agree upon was director you tech dot. Beat these outcomes are provided for in the M. HSA and it it needs to be something that happens outside of the act with all relevant stakeholders determining what what what is our state plan. It is provided for in the act but it doesn't need to be codified directly in the act. Eight and again it's we also agreed that that is why the act was not written with specific outcomes in it because needs change I think if what would be the sure is working great then aren't. Going to change maybe maybe we want to focus on homelessness it's been involved here after years should be set in stone. A second thing that we've heard about today. And a key piece of the image. Strict accountability funds. The. Mobile template said in your side panel independent paid members to provide his expenditures they can cut off funding for programs that are not effective. That has never been that was the promise to voters when we passed the M. HSA and it has never happened. I'm enforcement of the act has steadily declined beginning with AB one hundred and twenty seven. And again in twenty twelve wind damage got dismantled. Some from from AB one hundred which which was to build that started to take off and force minute to say. It is they they wrote this in eighty one hundred it is the intent of the legislature to insure continued state oversight and accountability of the mental services act. In eliminating. State approval of county mental health programs. Which I expect state. To establish a more if. During that. Complies with the mental health services act. And I don't hear from the little Hoover commission. It it in their in their letter. Of ever in the wake of the commission second review that the state must identify a well defined leader to administer oversee and enforce the MHSAA or it will remain difficult to articulate a cohesive vision. And ensure accountability. To alleviate many of the visible statewide impacts of mental illness. And given given me the arm out but if we're in the act we really believe. The goal of the state can be accomplished without rewriting or refreshing the MHSAA. We also believe that now is not the time for significant. Changes to the M. HSA the images they have strong not sub patient provisions. It was written. To gaps in available services and to provide services. He provided. Yes is Caroline proposal which was just released. Actually it knowledges that the agency has not considered the potential impact that overhauling the entire meant tells. May have on non medical mental health program. Stake holders on the following questions what impact would a fully integrated. Medical delivery system have on on mad cow program mandates. Eight until this is act Sam's a block grants. I would also now this is the only director MHS state in the entire car. The images. Proximally 20% of county behavioral health funding. And counties apply in another portion of an HSA funds toward. Fun. The whole system proposed name and a focus on the same populations that this MHSAA refresh intends to target. We really believe that any changes to the and just speak after. So that we know where the tree. Talking about human beings who are already in treatment they're already in this piece we can't just come in. And put a whole bunch of money in P. E. I. because what happens to these real human beings- live their lives because of the effective treatments that they're receiving. And third- this must. Numbers just say as in merry drop mental health policy damage to say was ground breaking in the levels of stakeholder involvement that it requires it requires counties to demonstrate a partnership with constituents and stakeholders throughout the process that includes meaningful stakeholder involvement. Not only are. On mental health C. program. Program implementation- monitoring quality improvement evaluation and budget allocations. And I will say. Any processes are happening in the counties but consumers are not involved in all of these elements this is another this is another of enforcement. If this in for we have at the county level I'm going. All the- being able to say Hey this is working in our local community this is not working. I'm Clinton consumers are the stake holders for stake holders who are the most significantly. Acted by any changes to the public and a whole system you must be AT. And meaningfully involved. So we ask that the legislature do its part to ink clued consumers and other stakeholders in any discussions regarding proposed updates or revisions to the MHSAA. I'm and we also beg you please ensure the I'm- oriented ankle driven. And that strict enforcement mechanisms are created thank you much thank you. I will comments brief for this analysts we will wants to focus on calling him as well- but did want to thank both cal voices and nominee for we were very intentional and making sure that the discussion would not be complete without making it very numbers are. Present as well- and in that light I actually. Plan on being two our December sixteenth hearing that from the county is. Yeah each all the center common area where they are doing dedicated out reach towards a culturally and linguistically part of our relation that struggles. To receive says. But I do think there. I will be with you director detected does not appear that we have a lack of. But a lack of. Fighting why did inefficient manner so we can digest it and help to make informed decisions is the goal of what I'm trying to bring to the conversation and so I looked towards working with go exceed of figure. Out there are additional resources that may be needed or we can. Convert ten. Trace in about proving. With that I will thank this panel for coming forward and invite up the fourth panel on callin Begin with our chief Brenda greatly. Good afternoon I'll Brenda great was chief of the medic how the new medical behavioral health division at the California department of health care services just one I think a committee. For inviting us to come here today to speak about cal. And you know just even sitting here throughout the afternoon- it's been great just to hear the comments and really the thinking that's going on- about how killing can. Are really helps strengthen our delivery systems because out based intent. I'm so essentially- with cal aim the over arching goals. Add to- somewhat so you're an initiative up through the quality of life. Things are beneficiaries- through the implementation of broad delivery system programs and payment reforms across other medical program and essentially we're looking to- manage member risk through a whole person care approaches to really thinking broadly about the needs of individuals- and then. Also considering- how best to address social science of. Also look stern and seamless system- by reducing the car accident increasing flexibility it's not always the easiest systems and systems to navigate- looking at how we can better strengthen those processes to improve access- and then also improving quality outcomes which I know it's just- our discussion- in the last- up and doing. Through value based initiative as mark. Our system producer data systems it came in. I'm so we're looking to do all of this in the coming months. Hey y'all farms under workers for the- which will be kicked. Number so just a little plug that we- are continue how these work groups in anybody's- public's welcome to attend listen and provide feedback you throughout the work groups or even after the work groups and we accept a written comment as well folks I thought as I for today I'm so are in kind of going over. The diff. Souls related to behavioral health. Of the foundation is our best of payment. And former looking to incentivize outcomes and quality over volume and cost right now I we have as a C. P. E. or certified public expenditure process and we're looking to move away from that to watch. Where I'm vestments can be made the deliveries with. Mental health and substance use delivery systems I'm still. In a clip our county partners all as well through our stakeholder groups to do this- Wanamaker we thought for. Want to disrupt services. If the current up finding out of our system so doing a manner. And are really like said this the foundation of so many of the proposals on which I'll go over about things like. Ten then all. Trying to other word we're working on it and- building a robust. Continuum of care. So and then another benefit. Describe a supporting better coordination with physical hall so I know there's been a question of the I for cations in- the managed care plans in mental health plans because the benefit split between the two deliveries. Do the US address that through a financing and care. Coordination approaches. Medical moving. On both my health and substance use to order our delivery systems- currently the current definitions outdated it's confusing- it's really a good talking to Rio remember examine that- and. So you in doing so. We're hoping to provide clarity and boy does allowances- and- the service. As well we're also looking at looking at a help cleaning can be done for services before diagnoses are made because that's another area of confusion which I think director you'll take mentioned as well we are also looking at our behavior hauled administrative an integration so- there's two types of integration. When we talk about this there's the behavioral health which is mental health and substance use disorder services and then that's one. Out that we're looking at. And I think early. On was the foreign aggression. Plans which is I. integration within manage care which are are some a separate track. The mental health and substance use disorder integration our boat to- improve efficiencies and access for beneficiaries. To be able to- have an easier time with screening. So that they're not necessary so the clinicians can can be able to do the. Right now to accept delivery system and so some overlap some that do not- so it's almost a double duty- same thing with- benefits to the system level we have a separate. Records are no health record since use decide assigned the source of the whole some of the news with Europe. On a call you organizations to separate reviews- and then also with our compliance reviews two separate reviews so looking to see how we might be able to streamline the process. I'm sure. You also get. More view of the system. I in addition with regional I'm trying- some of the county is- are particularly rural counties but other counties wall struggle with- getting access to providers as we talked about. Or even using these administrator. Be able to leverage. I approve of is it. My is the resources the noble for these counties. The dish are we have another- effort proposal on- the seriously mensal misters mental illness stirs emotional disturbance I am D. institutions for mental diseases waiver which was talked about a little bit earlier today shop and so we're- focusing workgroups on that route workgroup meetings on this. A demonstration opportunity that's- available through the centers for Medicare Medicaid services- it's an opt in so we need to decide or through go through a stakeholder process to decide whether or not to. Apply there's a lot of. Things involved so one of our first. Making sure that it. Is working on this for thinking about this is aware of all those requirements I was really to build out a continuum of care and- if the decision or the recommendation is made to apply for this waiver then what considerations does the state need to make when developing the application to us the amounts. And then in addition to four look into- for substance use disorder or drug medi cal organized delivery system- roll that into the nineteen. The waiver process with the exception of the residential piece when I'm in in that. I improvements to be current- special terms and conditions for a DMC ODS waiver- through lessons learned these things that we've learned as we've implemented- the ODS and several counties with thirty. I'm so we. I'm take a comprehensive approach- many is element arm I've met and are part of a. And so that folks could access the system in an appropriate way. I'm in addition to cal in which is a huge undertaking. And we've also got sent several things it's been blank walls- help at this stage- you know with the- implementation of the affordable Care Act. Hi the it up. Have a random you're standing one another too odd for care coordination- we've also- through other efforts we have and other requirements we've developed a dash or so we're putting out data it's a it's a nice. Foundation. We're growing it form to incorporate additional data I'm going to expand it qual. I do look at a different are elements between- the managed care system animal house system- so it'll include things- I'll just give a couple examples but I guess- adherence to antipsychotic medications for individuals with schizophrenia or diabetes and cardiovascular disease screening so just a couple of. Course that measures that will be incorporating. Also been working for quite a few years on- implementing the managed care final rule- so we've implemented a network adequacy standards and monitoring and mental health parity through that. Effort hello. The strategy for quality in our department so- that's throughout the whole depart. Behavioral health- but it's a comprehensive approach to looking at quality. And then most recently as I mentioned we just establish a medical behavioral health division but always underwent are a reorganization within the department and- we're hoping- that the goal of. This to a federal law in the north. Some one keep tape since he's with under. As well because I we are breaking mental health and substance use disorder services even closer together within our own department which will hopefully a nice foundation for the work that will be doing with that with account he's our stakeholders- through integration so I think that that I will pass it. Thank you special cover thank you. Some for all the time and attention all. And shifting gears for just. And all. How lame is really centered on medic cow where a majority of our clients get their coverage from- it with medic our county behavioral health is really the specialty to. For chilled PST T. as well as- medic how eligible into goals of all ages living with a substance use disorder Callie and provides the state's framework. For medic health system transformation and it's really anchored around the new all. Of our with. Smoke far. Teen waiver creek. Aces drug medic delivery system well this whole person care pilots I'm Kelly missed significant for county behavioral health and that it proposes numerous important reforms to the rules about how we're organized. We get. We is. Believe what proved access to services and also help us to improve the quality ordination of for our with other systems touching our clients- so I'm just going to kind of provide a little bit of dimension to the. Various initiatives that Brenda laid out and the first one. Quick points all necessity. He not only for who gets it into medic how- specialty mental health and S. T. D. services so I'm super important as it relates to the E. P. S. T. T. benefit for children- today- for both adults and kids were we are required to determine a diagnosis based on an initial assessment of someone as weeks before- you know humans are not static eating. Right would come in and as as a health side dishes. To. Around trying to manage that audit risk and why. Pourtant will not just because you know you get dating and it said. Mark on your great because that comes with. A lot to. Office of the inspector general's report you know and that we had to go back to the federal government one of the things we started to ask is can you be a real health is how much of this is a function of federal requirements on us and how much of it is a function. Of our own doing in other words what of this comes from state. Law this comes from federal law. To I'm AT fulfill the E. P. S. C. T. mandate for children- full letter of the law and expand services to those who appropriately need to be in the specialty delivery system for a health services. And I'll give you one quick example kind of a cross over with. Two children who were very early on in in the stages of their mental illness. And so as a result they adjusted and they got creative that. Stops third serving those children they issued. All of their provider and it you know here henceforth rather than bill medic health for the services you will use this P. E. I. dollars when kids meet these you know conditions that we got this allowances around well other counties are. Getting the same services using a medic Holland get it drying down federal financial participation this is this is not the state. Offering we should have a consistent set of rules around you know who we're serving and who were not and try. To my seeing- the federal financial participation as. It's the federal man the federal law requires that we try. Well as possible so. This and provide that care since making sure. You're playing images eight in terms of payment or form I couldn't agree with more with what Brenda said it really is the backbone of delivery system transformation for counties and again this is another place. Where we have a very- Byzantine date. Meant system it requires are per. Il to the minute I can imagine that. And it's one of the issues that that's impacting our ability to retain qualified workforce- we hear routinely from county directors. Folks are are leaving there's they're talking with their boots because they don't they they really just can't deal with the amount of documentation they have to provide and then with this if it risks. If you don't do it right it's dissolved out. Looks bad for the state and for cap. Being from a C. P. S. certified public expenditure based reimbursement system which by federal law does require a very high scrutiny the high bar standard of documentation. To an inter governmental answer- will be is significant in that it will. Still be fee for service so we're not sort of a radical sh. But it will I was. The terms of the documentation. And it'll allow us to do more to invest in quality- an improving the delivery system for our provide a we see it is a really nice next step that can move us on the road to getting to- of a value. Based system. So really. I'm I'm set at the end do you eyes. Earlier much more just to say that we do believe that it is in this picture and that we can hopefully. Bring again bring in more federal dollars but it time build out back base for structure. That we- one align incentives better there- enhance care managed and in lieu of services are the state's vision for how he. To replace what we did under the cap based. And it's a pretty big shift I do want to call out one thing the in lieu of services is- an option for states that comes out of the final rule and so it's- tied it's in federal law- it requires capitation and since we're not a capitated entity we would participate in in lieu of services. Who ship managed care plan- and then stick. Them enhanced care management which is- of trip out back capacity within medic how many care to do. Thank search court before opportunities for us to build stronger partnerships with medic how managed care through these initiatives. But with some important caveats first of all I'm the that. In my are the managed care plan brown how. All up rams flows from a population health management plan that they have to put together and. Kudos to DH CS for putting that on the table because it's really moving a proper. And we're all right. Your physical health to engage in services because don't typically just show up at the primary care clinic or when they are in the emergency department they quickly want to divert them or move them somewhere else you know it's been a little bit of a struggle to get folks into physical health care and we see that struggle reflected in their physical health outcomes being the primary drivers of early preventable deaths for our clients right. And so we believe strongly that the medic how managed care plan should require. Work with and their population help manage and- because or to work with our clients and there does need to be better collaboration beyond what's already in the ammo. Use we need to develop much stronger data sharing it it will require. Investment I think aligning our payment methodology for two out of the rest of the health world works will help facilitate some of that change and transformation but I'm to my earlier comments so much of the social determinants work and the public health work that were already doing is Connie behavioral health. Is actually not going to be captured in the context of- cal aim even through the wonderful as that we're gonna be making on these other pieces within managed care- so it's important that we understand those things and it's also. And they were. Under. Do is the behavior of. Much of anywhere else and to the hall the behavioral health space is so different from physical health in terms of what you can go out in the open market and just purchased and bring into network so we think that yes we should look. At ways that we can really add some support find the full two great pilot. Great between Inland Empire health plan and San Bernardino county there's some amazing clinical level integration work happening in riverside for example we want to figure out ways that we can spur these innovations and keep them going but to think that- managed care plans is going to go out be able to go out. I off the shelf and sort of. Their services what we're doing is a little bit now not not. It the we need to be you know very. Conscious about how we move forward with that- we. Do have a tremendous amount of. Complete add that flow from federal law at. Ten both in terms- and our compliance requirements for network adequacy I would argue in many cases are more rigorous than those that are required of the managed care plans today and. So we're going to continue to try to meet those height bars. At Lowe's up. My name I in our- estimates cal aim in no way will back fill. MHSAA dollars in in. I'm. Medical in a different way a change our payment systems per the payment reform proposal laid out and to build out these partnerships with medic help manage care that we can do a better job of adequately serving the medic how beneficiaries were in our program today. But as I said at the beach. This hearing. Is a long and important list of MHSAA fun activities that. Are not funded through Medicare all today that are not proposed funded under Medicare all that in many. To senator key point in mayor Sam regulate which includes a chronically homeless- involve population. Or at risk kids and so we really need to be thoughtful about some of the trade. No commercial plan parity thing that is the long game again the set the delivery system does not exist today and so really what we're gonna have to lift up his over time and again cal aim is not gonna be able to play again whatever those holes are they gonna be. Eating potentially by shifting or moving at. Dollars want to be really cool. Thank you for. Thank you and- in respect to the. To the many people who are here I will keep my comments short we will have time to further discuss calling. But I did want to say how excited I was. Being up for twenty. An eighty plus pages that it was- there's quite a bit of hope within the document and the value seems in the right place the brain is a part of the body and the better we can integrating create stingless systems the more efficient will be in providing care and I just appreciate the department's effort to end the county's efforts in working through- those hard conversations that need to be had it. Try you should now. With we will finish this and all and move on to public comment. Thank you. It is going to be the process for public comment is there a is there a- limit. As their just in terms of the number of people who are here I would. Try to keep it to her too okay. One size doesn't fit all. So well I can and I'm talking about culturally competent practices you cannot separate a mind from a culture you can't separate a mine from identity and there is a state wide. My program right dresses the needs of six Senate cat population and that's the cap you reduce. Sixty three at the state level and is not funded the counties is not expected to be picked up by the counties at least in L. A. county and whose continued existence and the ability to meet the needs of underserved populations we'll be going away the year after next. The population groups there is served is African American which is my population native American and Asian Pacific islanders Latino en L. G. B. T. Q. I am. Thank you to the director of whole systems learning and have. The try program turning. Resilience and really for each he. Asian parole and- foster informed foster we meet every single outcome in our program we have take getting involved individuals that. Are homeless there are now housed employed starting a business. We there pick it pop. Six of them to dress trom needs. Yes all of our individual because. We're a community defined evidence practice and we find that over two thirds. Okay D. and we serve them these are the people that are over looked these are the people you did not hear you heard maybe cultural content one. These needs are met by just that by. Just seconds. These needs are not by a- bit so. Thank you thank you. Hi my name's Jason Robinson and I am a person in long term recovery so thank you for- for your hearing at hand doctor around a lot. My help as you move forward in your best cation of an HSA. Look at things. I've been implemented. Add carrots by Rick from. Your support is a critical part of MHSAA philosophy and outcomes my E. organization is a pure run organization in Los Angeles county and we have approximately fifty staff full time everybody with lived experience we have say funding does. Run right. And we have to run a program at. I was in Los Angeles county which takes on average two hundred dates from assessment to move in 40% of people that call us. For housing movin within two days of calling saying they want housing. Twenty they ask for housing one of the reasons that. Is because we're using census data and my- but all eyes on the single fan. Market and rental houses it anytime in Los Angeles there are ten thousand single family homes for rent one of the things that's happened with the discussion around housing is that it's been dominated by developers. Who've been taking away he from this. Your support as an essential element of housing first practices so when we look at MHSAA incorporating a way to make sure that peer support is involved at every ask of pro. Is essential we heard about full Sir. Partnerships as we rolled out mental health services in Los Angeles county. Understanding of how to integrate your support and people with lived experience we have that data now the other thing that's. Important when we look at hospitalization rates California has a sick. Large or great the hospitalization rate than the knack. National bridge and one of the reasons it's not because of how. Is this research clearly shows that merely referring somebody to a self help support group in the community cuts the re hospitalization. Rates by 50% okay and peer support specialist group which between people even services people. Dead the base services so please make sure out some separate. Leave with a- leave thank you Sir. I'm willing I'm on track for me this. What are the provider. African American great tease the part six California rich despair no you want in your in your day out as no avail. Percenter sweet potato project. You know the. With a book another one. A son about any of. Reducing disparity predicate is. Invest in our culture we come can you define back this. Did you in this. Let me please come and- let's talk about what a deep dive of a stakeholder engagement could look like with the populations that we start because it's up to. Six of the NHL. Shouldn't be that way and we want to be a. X. thing on twenty. Looking at in the se- inside when it that's my little CRT P. a piece but I wanted something- different a little heavy can you. With me and I want to thank. She ate great genius. Nearest neighbor. And planning that needs for this you need think of like an image of state. But it the lines and it happened in the there's a there's an invisible elephant open the corner of the room and had to be black for the pink elephant it's a black elephant. And you look. Nothing. Areas that he says. Her time. This car serration fall steep yes. In schools talk about I risk. If you want to go make a difference is what it's about being. Amex the plants I have a solution. You would focus on children spelled. All with two. What do they have in common. Breath taking disproportion aliki of African Americans. Right taking. African Americans are in 7% Of the California. We cost Asian if you what with foster if you do it with every single category this process. Does not these kinds of very. The man. Who some women now phrase. This is Bob. This and. Putting gauge when you want to be effective with us you've got to be with us you got to engage us to be committed. To process a one and done in and out Hey folks group that's not work relationship. We're sorry. That's what keeps brown when we're not widgets are sold relationship in the process if you want an income at the thought that the financial impact we keep. Has this get this. Without I want to get the a DH. A stakeholder things coming up. You still there okay so we're we're- an advisory committee I think I'm not going to convince. Yes did you do. It I'll go with the first minute. I'm not well this. People five people one African American not one. Thank goodness cute. Here is the king. We're going to. That has to be addressed it has to be done with innovation. Thing is sex with hot. We can be any spaces Bubba thank you some. Well in. With IBM then saying much of the- I'm morning. Our office is based in the LA area but I'm with the California Blackmun's how can we are a statewide organization and we were in the five population areas five there is a California counties that have the highest popular of black women and girls and so I tell people all the time. Get to. It's working what's not working. For the most part. Things are not working it is incredibly challenging. For the women that were with and their families and the communities. Where they live and we can play to access mental health care services. Whether or not to sing it through the public school system or through the private. Your the challenges are there and I'm sure a lot of people in this room who is specially when you talk about in a severe mental health cases. Work mostly with women who are on the cusp. And we consider our standing in the gap. Clean the limitations of Star. Culturally come the absence of pot. Exist to the work force me that. So we the value three. There is project because of that funding we're in year three being to. I'm. Have tested a program that we have that we're gonna. Can find. We have been able to train black women to be. At. Right now we're doing the program in Los Angeles we've done in Sacramento in- December Dino will be in the bay area in February and we're going around. Trying to DO Fresno. Partnership with the with our friend Fresno. One that we know this funding is going to end in two years and that scares me so much because we've done such incredible work- women who really are standing on the edge of needing fines. For their you know even even needed to be hospitalized. This serious mental breakdown and having to deal with it for a- minute which is nationally recognized based on traditional African American and African culturally. Lee deeply rooted- believed impress some practices and we are seeing. Incredible success. These were trained by us and then go out into the community so. I did I saw. AT and to be able to help too we could we create resource list on our own because we have to screen those resources so thoroughly because you don't want to send someone to a place that when they go through a- intake process they're not going to see a therapist for six to eight weeks. That's inconceivable unconscionable okay. Place where they can come. On in. Talkin healing dealing share in all of those things. I mean I could go on and I we have a website you know you really I could go on but I but I want to say because of the funding. For the California reducing despair project. We were able to see us. I am in a- oil in the first so. We are very powerful but there's. So these dollars and to know that it'll end in two years and that there's a novel nothing it played. Another phase of it or a chance to. In order to even wait those. You know those outcomes and then see how we continue. Most of them have never heard of it unfortunately and that is a problem as well so you've invested sixty million dollars in something that is working so please I mean I I'm hoping everyone in the line hears it and the people begin to talk about it so. Thank you for the opportunity. What she said. Good afternoon Frank center into some additional resources that you may or may not be avail aware of we were. Hired by the AC to do a study the first ever and only study about older older Californians and their use of mental health- services to the MHSAA and we produced. A number of policy briefs including one about indicators and then also looking. From grams and also I did. And I think it I just you can. I'm about Cashen today and one is that there seem to be kind of an assumption that P. E. I. money was for children and youth and I just wanted to make sure that you all know which I'm sure you do that P. E. I. programs are beneficial for all age groups across the life. And on into an agreement with Mister Corey. I hope that you'll. Be rid. Of the HSA as it was craft fundamental component of the- life. Which you. So as you think about prioritizing as you think about these kinds of special populations that were- discussed at length today I want to make sure that you understood the older fans are soon to be 20% of our population they have high unmet needs their greatly under served we've got the data the OAC has the data we want to make sure that you continue looking at all the populations across the entire lifespan as you think about. Your prioritization thank you thank you ma'am. Hello. I am Richard Keller from Santa Cruz County California I am a consumer a mental health worker at the local psychiatric help facility and an advocate for people with disabilities seniors and their families I am a volunteer. What nami California and assets California. Voice I am. Concerned about the idea of changing the end cap of the mental health services out without any input from the mental health community families service providers serving in the mental health community. Problem is the California department of health care services and the mental health services oversight commission is not doing their job in enforcing establishing policies procedures guidance for counties to follow and measurements. Of funded programs and service is working to improve the lives of mental help. Community in California so who. Should report the state of California auditors report have did. Meditation being followed up to third job in fall mental hopes. Did your okay only follow. In which even the- funding the lack of enforcement has gotten worse since the California department- surfaces the tall. Okay. The county so this noted in this site soon the lack of guidance from the state as part of the problem. We need. The checkpoint part move healthcare services not the health services dirty I sing measure outcomes our team fiscal finding is being bullied serve as an advocate I have seen individuals are meant to halt get out of homelessness navigating them through and getting disability benefits affordable housing healthcare. And connected to support services such as. And supportive housing. I will monitor and make noise for My so. We might. It is four men in making the mental health services at work to help them at community improve their lives with lean. Says funds we are here we are United we are not going away just sit start junior thank you. It is the people have read them and- receive them as well. If any way we can try. To work comments closer to a minute I don't think the lines moving and- everyone has. That for you but I am gonna read my comments because I stood in line so sorry so my name is Theresa pass greeny and I am the proud mom of an adult son who lives aerobically with serious mental illness on he has spent the majority of his adult life in locked facilities. Are her. Show up at any point in time hello but he must be counted because he is us too and so our families like mine I support them in California's position statement on the MHS. Refresh however there is much more discussion that must take place in. Public and not just like your- original intent props. May just was not intended to fix every social determinants of health and in humanity in California it was intended to fund the greatest health disparity of serious mental illness the current emphasis on the sweeping her homelessness. Let's focus on the fact that families are wired to make. In order enter yes needed for stability any fix for the homelessness crisis must go beyond a right to shelter and it must go beyond only those currently on sheltered a right to shelter plan must. Include access to a full continuum of psychiatric services and include a full of what I have caught what might I point. That here families. If we are going to unclog the human log jam in our streets prisons jails in the back bedroom Eiji. Federal then we must focus on both the un shelter homeless and the at risk of homeless at some my populations who cannot live independently we first need a right to treatment before we forced anyone with a serious mental illness to fail first suffer and die if we want to California for all. Then the California a must be on bridging. The ideological to the mother when we cover. Spared Asian and care for sick I just didn't make one other comment there's been. The after being on former mayor mayor Starnberg and the and rusty see lex which is true but I'd also like to read there was another co author she is referred to as the mother of mental health service act and her name is rose king who I've been pledged to work with. For the last fifteen years she couldn't be here today in. Writing but- so. And actually has a different opinion than than dot then Darrell Steinberg on the intent of the act thank thank you ma'am.

Thank you Sir. Good afternoon check us tell us because we have of the California council many be behavior health agent which is comprised of community. Mental health and substance abuse disorders nonprofit organizations across the state. Paul in the offering a passage of prop sixty three C. B. H.

That. Concerns as the state goes in this process. Small in housing that any images a fund it's. Graham sure thing to be here to help us provide those individuals who utilize images. Housing should retain their eligibility for housing funded up. To solve this. Should be amended- for the use of images a month for a city services. For those of you for those who are incarcerated in on parole. E. MHSAA language should be amended to find the cystic are straight. And parole pop shins to reenter the community.

And finally- on evaluation and accountable. Both of the language of the image a say regarding the reports that counties must DAC gaps in the- I see an ally consequence. Going to do so and- the rules and responsibilities at the very least. If I wish and accountability thank you Sir. Good evening so bad with United ways of California animal attempt to stream comments that. In in housing we believe that prop sixty three can be a cattle. Mrs as a whole and as a key element in drawing down federal match for Medicaid spending as well as realizing the true intent of the PST T. I've we ever wanted to transform the mental health and substance use. Disorder system we need to become much more intentional around PI and begin a shift away from over path ology Ising our children and youth and particularly those that are exposed to trauma. Trauma does not equal mental illness but untreated I'm I can lead to serious health and mental health risks and hard realities we face on the streets today we think that the partnership between counties and schools cannot be overstated and well examples of using P. I **** in this manner exist we believe. More can and should be done and at the role commute. Successful will be necessary. This is where the support of the legislature and the- ocean comes into play. We can help establish local collaborative- frameworks to make this happen. Klay in terms of housing we can concur with other stakeholders and panelists. That homelessness is not- is not primarily an issue of mental illness but one of affordability housing stock in income inequality. No doubt that the role the MHSAA has and will continue to have instant- is substantial it is only a slice of the statewide pie. Having a an alignment with other efforts such as cal aim will be important in addressing- the housing and homelessness crisis that has been many decades in the making and I think you for the attention of this committee to this issue. Thank you thank you ma'am. A good afternoon. Members of the committee my name is now I have to ask miss and the- legislative policy analyst praxis California. I am with cal voices formally nor cal MHA the oldest Pirenne mental health agency. Organization our advocacy organization in California. I am a consumer with lived experience and I support my colleague Mister carries testimony from earlier today. The MHSAA does not need to be changed to refresh it simply simply needs to be reinforced. For state level report since two thousand thirteen and verify the lack of oversight and accountability to local community planning process sees. And also by state level agencies that created the on spam HSA surplus. That represents a broken system that we talk about today. If today's hearing is in response to the homelessness crisis. Then you should know that those those that are at greatest risk or people with extremely low income. And the income disparities primarily put focus upon black and brown communities. Approximately ninety four thousand- over seventy four percent. Of those experiencing homelessness are in more need of living wages and affordable transit. Oriented housing rather than mental health services. The MHSAA find is reserved for mental health services for fourteen million public mental system clients. I secondly I wanted to echo that client and consumers must be treated as a central partners. In our discussions regarding the proposed change changes to the M. HSA. At one additional comment that I wanted to include what was to Mr Mr freighter assembly member Frasier's I request. For budget asks for primary policy proposals C. R. D. P. has been looking for- budgetary reallocation or- sponsorship for the last couple of years. The O. A. C. as- push them to find to advocate for their own funding so that would be one thing to perfect primary prioritize. For moving forward as a permanent funding structure also the governor knew some propose that the budget was a primary source for funding for peer support systems in California on the veto of. S. B. ten so there is an opportunity to present services as a priority point in the budget this year. Good evening Mister chair I'm fairly dating on behalf of the California state association of counties I'm going to be very specific us the sack and our members the county supervisors of California support five different things that would include counties retaining the funding you've seen many examples today of how. Counties work with non profits schools other local government entities and. Some we really strongly encourage flexibility we do up some disorder. Really serve those folks would help quite a bit- don't wanna narrowing up senator Steinberg talks about serving homelessness and those in the criminal justice system and we don't again. Want people to fall into those categories before we can help them right now with them and just say we can help the before that happens. And we do not ship the last few years along with the homeless is funny to really focus on that. For those who are homeless plus all age groups. Who need services who aren't homeless- we also think cal aim is a great opportunity and really are really excited about the- sense of partnership from DH CS and appreciate their- obstacle- working groups and seeking counties in but as well as- of course consumers and providers. At least port accountability and transparency. This as the director the truck had to. Do it we work. It the present reserve level when people criticize the reserves to figure out how the money can be use we've done everything we can to make it specific and make all picture all counties are complaining we need your help to have that single oversight entity to make it happen. Thank you thank you ma'am. Kelly Brooks I'm here this afternoon on behalf of the urban counties of California. The fort to our fourteen county members represent 80% of the total population of the state we too are please. Public conversation going on around the whole. Act were lakes supportive of increased flexibility and I think this is a good opportunity to have further conversations about. Making substance use disorder- up primary diagnosis of substance use disorder. As a potential- that at me to say could from those services- we would encourage a very careful and thoughtful discussion around MHSAA. Particularly since we know so many of our counties are using I meant to say is match for federal Medicaid funds. And so we don't want to see our existing mental health services system. Disrupted by a potentially moving money around. We ought. To represent the count or side who has use that mental health services act as the glue- to their entire mental health system they're doing very. Made of things up around integrating primary care and behavioral health and the kinds of things that I think cal aim is headed port. They. Make sure their system continues to be event. I'm dead and then finally. Homeless and mental health I was just at a conference last week with the return researchers from UC San Francisco looking at adults over the age of fifty who are becoming homelessness. And behavior health isn't the reason the. Reason. Chris stoner Mertz California. Family services we have a hundred and forty five members serving children and families in the child welfare juvenile justice behavioral health and education systems. I'll be brief and will submit a more expansive comments- primarily I just want to say that I think that with the current development of Callaham Access to services. Really appears to help that insert pushing the boundaries of the current funding options and we have to hold ourselves accountable to serving our most vulnerable and marginalized please.

Point 5% The fact that they probably are stigmatized in any other population groups- age why. Early intervention hundreds of them from falling into. I should ending. Woman as your health. Did you lose friends and your economic situation falls- I wanted to thank director Cabrera for mentioning the issue of homelessness in the older adult population. Outs are complete- rapidly became the largest percentage of the population. The research is that I did from doctor Margot the show. Found that up.

Thank you very much thank you ma'am. Evening Mister chair of Linda to what's on behalf of the California Pat I think health network. One port of call for reducing disparities. For the- then you heard from countless community members today the value of community defined practices and we would hope that these types of practices are really woven into the fabric of how we deliver mental health services- so number one just making sure that we can sustain on these programs and making sure they don't just die as funds dry up but they actually are taken into consideration. By counties at a love scene that they help improve the health outcomes of the most vulnerable under served in a- community member. At. We can continue I'm the made so far thank you thank. Hello my name is Carter I am. Is on with cal. And I definitely appreciate the opportunity to give public comment today and to be able to beat him in this long individuals who definitely wanted to lend their voices it is where topic I do want to acknowledge before I. Give in to my public comment. Attached to her you have the public. Left and it doesn't necessarily support the camaraderie that I do believe specifically the MHSAA really. Calls for so I just wanted to speak but I. Still hear especially those individuals who are decision making. To revamp our revised- things that have not accurately been executed therefore it cannot accurately be assessed so I really feel as if the MHSAA is accurately exit. Then we can stand back and we can make us as- to what we need to revamp things or provide over the case says and taste it's six am nurture and they move legislation we know this- we've heard a significant amount of. Meaning to stick that were brought up today and in support of the S. M. HSA and also in a possible areas of improvement yeah as a live experience someone who has provided a significant amount of different levels of care of for various MHSAA funded. Plans to consumers of mental health services here in Sacramento for over a decade and now having the- able to provide- support and honesty it level. Oldest and state why. Is the organization here in California support. How it really call unprecedented amount of meaningful. And stakeholder involvement- I'd have to say that. It's I see the point system partnering not only include Jack up can. As the- cramming administration revisions implementation and all the other areas that MHSAA funded programming. Is mandated by the act to specifically do- and I we have a panel of. And that's full. We would be violate their original intent act by. Not ensure that you have the part of consumers in numbers. And provide. As we've heard respective to whether or not these expansions are these new ideas that are at the table are really what they need to sell we must do a better job job it and genuinely enforce the act across the state order early assessed it in attempt revisions. If necessary. In Cannes in up. The in our state to its full statute and what. Because I say as a previous service- has provided those definite fill in the gaps that people can't get anywhere else and I've seen people come from the gutter and florist because of the MHSAA as it is right now- so I really just want to consider our apps. Consideration that the image of the state as it is and it's really work forcing it and then after we've had a proper time to. Set it. Pollution of the community thank you thank you. Hi thank you commission for hearing us. Just like to echo what Tiffany said- it is rather contain set for seven hours but we really believe what we have to say that's why there's so many people here that more. Speaks to the value of input- for us to be clear at the end of the day I've I've come with people with. Elise or physical disabilities that that through this whole thing and heard. One speaker but none of those. People are here to hear us so I just want to say that. My name is. The way. It is. The others have been here today- I. Am also someone who is happier. I have lived experience I've been hospitalized in state yeah. Spittle I'm also a mother I had a child who had autism and- diet. And cancer six years ago it's Chris. And another. US panic disorder. And IT. I also have a sister who was diagnosed with schizophrenia many many years ago. Also growing up I was chronically homeless from a very young age and with my children. So I also grew up in a culture of poverty and I know what it means to be a big pile of money and think I know how to spend it better than anything else. I know how much. Homelessness is a big deal because it was me. I. I've been a counselor and working in crisis services. Five you. An advocate if it hadn't been. For MHSAA programs and peer support. The fifteen minutes from paradise. As you know with the camp. A we had a- we. Now have a four thousand people that on back to pick. The community as a fifty this. And a lot of that falls in our community. And now in a that led state in. Fire now has thousands and thousands of people they're traumatized living in trailers to this day. I heard me talk about ninety homeless people. I've done a lot of studying was sharing and visited other based. On that fifty thousand of those Thomas P. born out on. Distribute right what does that mean the other counties. They're different needs and different approaches and different counties. I represent the Superior region where the northernmost sixteen counties we go from the ocean to the Nevada border from the Oregon border to just north of Sacramento. We are a will hate wide part of tell off nor and culture you know you have. To the bay but they forget about the four hours north. I represent the report in northern California real northern California. In a. Is that the techniques and the this this is offer to someone it tent on a sidewalk in. It's going to be completely different than the person next out. Next waters of the Sacramento in mount Shasta they're two completely different there are similarities but- unless you give that people are back to the communities and the peers and people that are in those places. You won't know what that is. So I'm asking you today a backup Calvert says position don't fret or re organize or otherwise alter image okay as. Until you enforce it the way it is. I'm and also include. And power support certify S. continue and expand educational programs I'm here today because of the poor from campro share name me access they taught me what this is about in that. Case we shared that with more. We may not even need at this meeting I'm not so I heard you that collaboration is complicated it takes up. Rick it is. And is about pulling people from who know what it's about to tell you what they need. And here's also offers a level accountability you want John ability than us the. That's right and. The person who had been peers and price this is what I can tell you. The new flat. Your work force is filling in gaps that are shortage providers. After. Ste at Staten give us dignity and let us county holders and peers decide as I just say all right has written as it already I that decide our way and we are the experts are recovery and. Good evening my Cascada I represent less familiar accounts center we are one of the key fob. Jewel projects through the California using this project. Aside learn. In the old days thirty five which is used to- I was stuck in in twenty five years and the mental health and- to note thirty five agencies. Do and reached. I'm incredibly innovative ways to serve an engaged to get these. Sure for many many years. I went to pick up when I speak about engagement hi engagement that actually has come in from both trends agents reach in the community. By community re reaching out the agencies that we work with that can get. Aids utilization of server but I can tell you too many stories. About success not all of our agency but through the- he's in this price. But really what is that community define prop says I really could not think of to be. Our community is in the cage so we can reduce Sperry's. In thinking that straight into presents and straight into homelessness straight utilisation of Sir says of mental health that could be avoided if we are. Prevention. Schindler's up for them. I urge you to please find this program played on an- the two years that we have left. Was re create trouble for them no it is happen. My name is Allison Monroe. From Alameda county I'm ready full doesn't mom and family members in Alameda can. List a that's the norm for them. And so we have perhaps a different point of view on MHSAA. There's two things. Well first of all we don't we're not a refresh. Of M. HSA and the direction that binder. Hello in two homeless as. It's sick that the homes with those prices are likely to not. All my family member. Would not stick in is there. License license support housing they're not burdened cares. But MHSAA my hand care. I've heard from Robert Wratten without a county. To spend a lot MHSAA my on both ears. Capital in technologies funds. This time or money to help the sickest. So we went ahead and place I am and we are not. Of another. Process it would take money that's supposed to be for this basically now and spend it in. Other cars cannot break because I'm sure but not our children's. There's two things we want to things basically- are the group does is called Alemannic as me. One is what treatment beds. Say at times the money can be spent a lot facilities but it has and it could be it's me you can't spend it on a long term. Facilities or tail. But in a few. Crisis treatment you would help. And again we would like it might be money Borden cares that's something that's desperately missing. But I think we're a person the hope of me Hey. To the can't record trip days if he gets in trouble if he is if he smokes if he does this to that. He can come back that place he home. That put a boarding care ida B. that's what we ought to be doing. It to save money. Not everybody. Is well enough to be able to live in an apartment. Good. I can't stand to put billion to spend. Which should be spent on many things are a few things. Needs spent on the ten thousand. In the state county there's maybe six hundred. The rooms in a jail on bogus trifling charges. Those people need to be helped and they ought to ideally if the system worked each one of them would have a choice whenever they needed it. Either a short. Statement civility or. A good boarding care bed. When they're well. Can stable income. Was it in more with one board I wish under these. We only have. Three Philip facilities like synergy. And that's probably enough you know I'm not talking about a lot of people I'm not talking about half the population record the population or even 4% of the population I'm talking about ten thousand people and their families. And I brought this T. shirt today it has a picture mark repeat. He lives in Solano county he lives on the street he has schizophrenia and T. B. R. I. any as a piece of metal in his leg he has no eyes. But he's homeless and his family's tried everything. To get him off the street. Everything he's been switched back and forth between the TV I system. Whatever consists of. And the mental health system and. He wanders off from work at his family watched him die in the street very slowly. Here's they bring in food you know they try to dry out as close a bring a phone. You know they listen to what he has to say. But if our state can't do the right thing for this guy there is no kit of ours is safe so that's why I brought this teacher thank you for let me talk. Thank you ma'am. More to make. Hello from. My name is now she's even more frustrated because in a way it happening again. My. MH when the needs haven't even been meant were being met and are meant to hold minority communities. Enforce MH at the funds don't take any.

I'm also from nami Contra Costa I'm also a family man thank you for listening to me. As you. I bet you see any issue that's speak even eight. There's not Asian people the onus.

Model on their end so that's the whole hard that she didn't know where our hotel ask for help also- I talked to a on TV see international students he asked for help as I told her him and with the phone number he can call one of the. Phone numbers a hotline he said that he. Did the call the one time. Other understanding him I understand that much. At prices he hung up on the phone still and pay for him the language is more important so that's the. All I ask is that the T. programming costs across the county they're small language if for that or Chinese. And also nami has a lot of a program like a vision that Konami basics we only have English materia I we can have a phone that to translate the two Chinese so. Get the teachers to teach that program to get to the issue and the also.
