SO I SEE THAT WE DO- WE ARE ABSENT A QUORUM. SO ONE TWO THREE FOUR YEP SO WE WILL CONTINUE AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND GO DIRECTLY TO FILE ITEM ONE. SB FIVE THIRTY ONE SENATOR WHITE CAL SKI- OKAY FILE I'M SORRY FILE ITEM SIX FILE ITEM SIX SB FIVE THIRTY ONE SENATOR WHITE CAL SKI THANK YOU FOR JOINING US SENATE THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS A SET OF AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE DETAILED IN THE ANALYSIS. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF TIMING CONSIDERATIONS THOSE AMENDMENTS WILL- NEED TO BE TAKEN IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MOREOVER AFTER WE AGREED TO THESE COMMENT- THESE AMENDMENTS OPPONENTS RAISED ADDITIONAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL'S IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE. AS PART OF YOUR PRESENCE PRESENTATION PLEASE CONFIRM THAT YOU AGREE TO THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND THAT YOU WILL MAKE ADDITIONAL CHANGES AT A LATER DATE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE. THANK YOU SO VERY VERY MUCH MR I DO CONFIRM WITH THE CHAIR OF JUDICIARY'S PERMISSION I WILL BE AMENDING THE BILL- IF IT'S IF I'M SUCCESSFUL DAYS TO GO THROUGH THAT COMMITTEE- AND IT WILL ALSO AGREED TO THE ADDITIONAL REQUESTS. FOR A SIX MONTH IMPROPER IMPLEMENTATION DELAY IN THIS BILL TO GIVE THE PARTY SAID. ADEQUATE A TIME TO GET THAT SET UP SO I AM EXPECTING AND IT'S ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OUTLINED POSITIONAL SIX MONTHS IS OUTLINED ON PAGE SIX OF THE- THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS. THANK YOU SENATOR AND YOU MAY PROCEED WITH PRESENTATION SOME. OF MY PRESENTATION SINCE WE REMOVE SECTION TO MY PRESENTATION WILL FOCUS ON SECTION THREE OF THE BILL A THAT REMAIN WILL REMAINS- AFTER THE AMENDMENTS AND AT ITS CORE SB FIVE THREE ONE IS A BASIC RECORD KEEPING TRANSPARENCY AND PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS- TO HAVE SOME DEBT THAT THEY GO. THIS LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN PASSED THE FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES ACT WHICH BROUGHT MUCH NEEDED REFORM TO A LARGELY UNREGULATED AND BROKEN SYSTEM OF BUYING THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THERE WERE REPORTED CASES OF WIDESPREAD ACTIONS TO COLLECT AGAINST THE WRONG PERSON CHARGING THAT THAT THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN PAID OFF AN EFFORT TO COLLECT AN INCORRECT AMOUNT. TO THE. THAT THAT ACT SECOND TWENTY THIRD CHAIN HELP TO DRAW THE ISSUE. BUYERS WHO HAD THEIR DEBT SOLD LET ME EMPHASIZE ADVERB SOLD TO THEM TO HAVE THE OWNERSHIP THE DIGITAL OUT THICK AND IT ALLOWED TO CONSUMERS TO REQUEST THAT PROOF FROM THE PERSON SICKENING COLLECTED DEBT IT ALSO REQUIRED THE DISCLOSURE OF BASIC INFORMATION SO THAT THE CONSUMER KNEW HOW MUCH THAT WAS SOLD THERE WERE ANY INTEREST OR FEES AND WHAT WAS THE DAY THE LAST PAYMENT. SO UNFORTUNATELY AFTER. WE HAVE REPORTS FROM LEGAL SERVICES THE DEBT COLLECTORS ARE GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY TO ASSERT THAT THE DEBTS THAT THEY'RE COLLECTING RIGHT NOW. ARE BEING ASSIGNED TO THEM AND NOT BEING SOLD SO BECAUSE THE DEBT IS NOT BEING SOLD CONSUMERS RIGHTS AND ALL THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE GAVE THEM BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH THE FAIR DEBT BUYERS ARE PRACTICE ACTS. ARE BEING CIRCUMVENT SO THAT COLLECTORS ARE TARGETING- IT'S THE SAME OLD PROBLEMS THEY'RE TARGETING. THE WRONG DEBTORS TO COLLECTING AN INCORRECT AMOUNT AND THAT THE CONSUMERS HAVE NO WAY TO DETERMINE THE TRUTH OF THEIR CLAIMS. SAID THE HIGHLIGHT THIS. NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND WHY WERE I'M BRINGING FOR THIS MEASURE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS THAT THE CONSUMER. THE BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS FOUND THAT FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH IS ONE PLUS WE HAVE. INFORMATION COLLECTING DEBT NOT OWED WAS THE NUMBER ONE CONSUMER FINANCIAL ISSUE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE TOTAL THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN CASES AND THAT ONLY INCLUDES THE PEOPLE THAT REPORTED THE CASES THAT THEY'RE COLLECTING THE WRONG DATA. I'M NOT THAT BOB WHITE CASKET. SO THE BILL BEFORE YOU WOULD REQUIRE DEBT COLLECTORS WHO HAVE DELINQUENT GET ASSIGNED TO THEM TO HAVE PROOF THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT ON THAT DEBT. AND THE BILL WOULD ALSO GIVE THE CONSUMER TO RIGHT TO REQUEST THAT PROOF ALONG WITH OTHER BASIC INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO THAT THAT. THESE RIGHTS ARE EX THE EXACT SAME RIGHTS THAT WE GAVE CONSUMERS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE FAIR DEBT ARE. BUYING PRACTICES ACTS AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE DOWNEY KANELL KAISER REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION IN SUPPORT. OF THE BILL AND I WOULD URGE AND I FELT. THANK YOU SENATOR AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND I DO WANT TO REMIND WITNESSES THAT YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH. OUR FIRST AND ONLY WITNESS AND SUPPORT WILL BE TESTIFYING OVER THE PHONE MODERATOR. PLEASE CONNECT US WITH- DONNIE- KIND OF KAISER FROM THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION. IT'S KIND OF CRAZY LIKE SHOULD BE OPEN TO SIMPLY ON MUTE. YES GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS DANIELLE CANDOR CARTER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION WE ARE A GROUP OF MORE THAN A DOZEN LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM AROUND THE STATE WORKING TO BUILD A STATE AND A FUTURE. IN WHICH CONSUMER RIGHTS AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE ARE FULLY RECOGNIZED AND FIRMLY ESTABLISHED AND TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE THREE ONE WHICH WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. WHO ARE DEALING WITH DEBT COLLECTION ACTIVITY GOOD MEMBERS WORK EXTENSIVELY WITH LOW INCOME CONSUMERS WHO HAVE RECEIVED COLLECTION LETTERS FROM OR WHO ARE BEING SUED BY DEBT COLLECTORS. ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS AQUINAS ASKED IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE DEBT COLLECTOR. MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE TIME THEY SAY NOW. DEPENDING ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE COLLECTION LETTER OR THE LAWSUIT LEGAL AID PROVIDERS ARE USUALLY ABLE TO DETERMINE THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR AND IDENTIFY THE ACCOUNT THAT THE DEBT COLLECTORS COLLECT IN A POND. BECAUSE SO MANY DEBTORS GO UNREPRESENTED MANY ARE STUCK NAVIGATING THE PROFITS ON THEIR OWN AND MAY NEVER BE CONFIDENT THAT THE COLLECTION COLLECTOR. IT'S TRULY COLLECTING ON A DEBT THAT THEY- TO REITERATE WHAT THE SENATOR HAS JUST STATED SB FIVE THREE ONE WILL REQUIRE THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION OF THE ENTITY COLLECTING THE DEBT. IT WILL ALLOW DEBTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS IS THAT A DEBT COLLECTION AND IT WILL ALLOW THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THEIR DEBTS WITHOUT EXCESSIVE. COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED ON. IT'S IMPORTANT TO THAT IN MOST OF THE SOME. THE COURT. HAVE BEEN A SIGN THE DEBT IN THIS IS BECAUSE IN MEDIC THAT. OR THE- WILL NOT SELL THE DEBT BUT IT'S FINE THE RIGHT TO CULTURE COLLECT TO THIRD PARTY TECHNICAL. AGAIN WHEN DEBTS CURRENT FIND IT RATHER THAN SOLD THE PROTECTION FROM THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE THIRD THAT BUYING PRACTICES ACT DO NOT APPLY. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE COLLECTORS THAT ARE ASSIGNED THAT WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE BASIC INFORMATION TO THE- TO THE DOCTOR SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING THAT. THE DATE OF DEFAULT OR THE DATE OF THE LAST PAYMENT IN THE NAME OF THE ADDRESS OF THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR. IN ADDITION SB FIVE THREE ONE WILL PREVENT THE DEFAULT JUDGMENT FROM BEING ANSWERED IF THIS INFORMATION IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE LOCK. CALIFORNIA DEBTORS SHOULD NOT END UP WITH DEFAULT JUDGMENT FROM A DEBT COLLECTOR THAT CANNOT. EVEN TELL THEM BUT THE- THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR IS. WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND CLICK URGENT YOU'RE EITHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT WITNESS I WOULD LIKE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM.
