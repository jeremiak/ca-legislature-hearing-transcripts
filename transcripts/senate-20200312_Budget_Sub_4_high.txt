THERE'S A- NOW THIS IS THAT SAYS WITH THE LANGUAGE YOUR TECH CLAIM IS AND THE CONTRACT IS ENDED- AND THAT IT. IS THAT DEPARTMENTS THAT MOST SHOULD BENEFIT FROM THE IF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM AND AFTER THAT'S THE QUESTIONS I HAD. THANK YOU FOR TWENTY MILLION DOT. THIRTY TWO CAN SPEAK. BECAUSE I'VE MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE. MOM ASSUMING THAT DEFICIENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED THAT WE SHOULD BE SAVING MONEY AND- IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WE'RE NOT SAVING MONEY IT'S OUR WORK INTO M. WHEN ONE OF THEM ONE IS. DONE AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS DONE AND WE COME BACK AND I'M BECAUSE NEED SPEND MORE MONEY TO BUILD MORE FUNCTIONALITY THE END THAT WE I MISSED IF WE DISCOVERED IN THIS.

IT'S THREE. THANK YOU MADAM TO COME A FIVE RECORD PLEASE THESE ARE MY IF I MISSED ANY OF YOUR BUT WHAT WHAT RESPECT I THINK THERE SORT KNOWS. BY SOME FOLKS WANT THE PROJECT THE IS TRYING TO GET OUT FROM UNDER OVERSIGHT THIS PROJECT I JUST WANT TO STATE ON THE RECORD THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CASE I THE SEMESTER IS. THIS PROJECT BRINGS ALLOW. THE STATE BUDGET EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD NEVER HAD BEFORE WE THINK THAT SERVES THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND- WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH IDENTITY AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE OF COURSE ABOUT WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL FOR SITE AND WHAT SHOULD OVERSIGHT ON HIS IS MISSING GINNY DOES STATED IN OUR TESTIMONY AS WITH. THE PRIOR HERE. IN PRODUCTION. HE IS IT FOR SOME IT A SIGNAL A CRITICAL PORTION OF FUNCTIONAL BUT BUT IN IN THE OVERALL CONTEXT IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF REMAINING FUNCTION IS LEFT TO DO AND WE THINK THAT'S WHERE THE OVERSIGHT SHOULD BE FOCUSED BUT AGAIN WE ARE NOT LET UNLIMITED PER SITE WE'RE NOT GONNA LOOK FOR THE END TO GET AROUND FROM OVER WE'RE HAPPY CAN DOES THIS IN SO. WE CAN LANDED UP BECAUSE OF. I SAID AT THE- PROJECT. VENUS INTO THE TWENTY CENTURY I DON'T RECALL EARLY I IF WE MAKE AN EFFORT AND SECURE CALL SAVINGS IT WAS MORE REPLACE HUNDREDS A LEGACY SYSTEMS A TO BECOME CREATE COMP BECAUSE OR MAINTAIN. THOSE TECHNO THAT THIS SETS ARE NOT OF IN THE MARKET PLACE AND ARE NOT BEING TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS ANYMORE. I'M AND SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF A WHOLE. SMALLER AND SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE LOT OF MURPHY RETIRED STATE EMPLOYEES AT THAT THOSE SKILL SETS THEY RETIRED AND THEN THEY COME BACK TO WORK OR TO SCHOOL. SOME OF THERE'S A LOT OF. THE MOVE SHUT DOWN HUNDREDS OF LEGACY SYSTEMS AND MORE ARE BEING SHUT DOWN AS WE SPEAK COULDN'T CAL STARS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M AND IN FIVE WITH THIS LAST THE- PLUS IT. THEY OP I THINK IT'S LUMPED IN THE CON OF FISCAL BILL. CAL DID. MRS LEE WAS CHANGE THE WAY THE STATE DOES ACCOUNTING AND MISS THE STATE HAD DONE A CAPPING AWAIT THE WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. I'M NOT A COUNTY- BUT WE HAVE THOSE PEOPLE ARE. THEY CAN. YOU THE- GRANULAR LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERSTAND BUT IT IT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY ARE COUNTING WORKFORCE WORKED AND WAS ABLE TO TALK TO THEM SOMETHING UP BEFORE THAT IN HINDSIGHT WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE AND CHANGE. FOR WE RECOGNIZE. AND WE'RE STILL TAKEN SOME FOR THAT BUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT WE WE'RE DEPLOYING. AS IN THOSE RESOURCES THE VA'S. ARE AT THE PART COUNTY SHOPS OR TO SOME DEPARTMENT COUNTERTOPS SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT FISCAL WITH THIS GIRL DOES A PROVIDES A LEVEL TRANSPARENCY THE STATE'S NEVER HAD BEFORE WHERE OKAY TO. IT'S FUN TO GO TO THE PARK. MONEY BROKEN OUT IN THE DEPARTMENT. USE THAT MONEY AND ON THE TGS INTO THE PRODUCT. OKAY NOW SEE HOW THEY'RE SPENDING NOW IN WHAT VENDORS AND WHEN WHAT THEY'RE BUYING AND SO. WE THINK ALL THAT IS A VITAL STATE. TRANSPARENCY CREATED A WORK. MEANS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE. AND THAT'S THE PIECE WITH WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH NOW. WE THINK WE'RE GETTING AHEAD OF IT. US TO DO AND- QUESTION I DID I DRESS ALTER YOUR QUESTIONS MANAGER I BELIEVE THAT AND I THE ISSUE OF THE I MEAN I GUESS WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS THAT IS IT'S CLEAR. THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR FROM THE PROJECT IS ALMOST COMPLETE. AND THAT THERE ARE FEW TASKS LEFT THAT WILL BE DONE BY THE JUNE. THIRTY AT TWENTY TWENTY DATE. F. BUT IT BECAUSE BECAUSE WHAT I HEAR WHEN I HEAR THE LA- SAYING IS THAT IS. THIS MAY BE PERSPECTIVE- MAYBE I SHOULD ASK WHETHER THAT NEW IF THE NEW THAT THE INTEREST IN HAVING LATE. DEAFENED DEFINITION- OF END OF PROJECT- WOULD BE PERSPECTIVE. BRENT METZ CURLY YES SO THE DEFINITION OF PROJECT COMPLETION THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE SCOPE THAT WAS REMOVED WITH S. P. R. EIGHT- EIGHT AND WOULD LOOK AT. ALL THE WHAT WE FIND WITH IT EIGHT AS KIND OF PROJECT COMPLETION IT WAS A THERE WAS A TO USE THAN AMONG. BACK IN ALL JUST THAT WE- LEGISLATIVE. THE ALTERNATE WE DO AND A BENCH BY THE TO THERE ISN'T IT DELAY IN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE ANTICIPATED TO BE DONE BY JUNE THIRTIETH BUT WE ALSO SEE YOU THERE SOME IN EXAMPLE. INITIALLY DEFINED TEN TO INCLUDE AN OF A- YOU. FINANCE THE FISCAL. BECAUSE THEN THAT WOULD AT LEAST GIVE US SOME CONFIDENCE THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE DATA IS BEING SHARED BETWEEN THE FISCAL STIMULUS SYSTEM AND WOULD GIVE US MORE CONFIDENCE THAT WE CAN PRODUCE ACT SHOULD ACCURATE FIND TO REPORTS STAT GREAT SOLUTION IS DEPLOYED I'M THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT COULD BE DETERRED SUCH AS THE- OF THE FUR DEPARTMENTS THAT'S ALREADY. BACK ON HOW MANY HAVE BEEN DE COMMISSIONED WHAT THE SAVINGS WERE THEIR NUMBER WAYS THAT THIS COULD BE DONE BUT FOR US- RECOMMENDATION WAS TO FOCUS. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE INTO WHEN IT LOOKED AT THIS PROJECT INITIALLY AND WHERE WE ARE NOW AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME DISCREPANCIES THERE BETWEEN THE TWO. OKAY WE ARE WE ARE ARE WORKING WITH WITH YOUR STAFF AND AS WELL AS- CDT AND THE L. L. TO COME TO A DEFINITION OF WHAT BUT AS WE WERE WITH JUST A POINT OF CLARIFICATION ON SOMETHING THAT YOU STEP USE YOU'D STATE. I JULY. TWENTY ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY AND- FOR THE CONSOLIDATED CASH RECORD COMING OVER AND INTO THE INTO THE FISCAL SYSTEM FROM THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WHAT WILL BE LEFT IN THE P. SAID IT'S BEING DELAYED FURTHER IT IS THE KEY. THE EXTENSION THAT THE TO BE DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE KAFFIR BY THAT THE STATE COMPTROLLER WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT SIX MONTHS RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS BLAISE BUT I'VE ASKED MY FROM WERE PRIMED AND NOT AND WE'RE STILL BUILDING THE SCHEDULE SO I DON'T HAVE A MINIMIZED WE WANT TO CONSIDER A- AS WE HAVE. A WE- FOR THIS I'M AS- CAPRON OF THEIR SISTER SO BEING ABLE TO DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME IF WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE L. L. IS THAT YOU WANT TO. CAL TO BE. SERVICE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT. TO GET THROUGH BUT THE ACTUAL BUILDING- I'VE THE- THE SYSTEM ITSELF. WE WILL BE IN TESTING- IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ON AND GO. WE ARE NOT. WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE BEING VERY CAUTIOUS IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE TESTING AND LOADING THE CORRECT DATA INTOTHE SYSTEM. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE BOTH THE LEGACY SYSTEMS DATA AND OUR SYSTEM FOR THE- AT. THE STATE COMPTROLLER SORRY. TO BE ABLE TO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE. ARE MATERIALLY CENTERED SEC RIGHT I'LL AND THAT IS AFTER THAT WE WERE TAKING VERY SERIOUSLY. I'M GOING TO CONTINUE. WE ARE CONTINUE TO DO A PANTS MISSILES I WAS TUNING. SO ACT BOARDING DEFERRED TO PART IT'S- WE EXPECT THAT EACH ONE OF THOSE WILL GET I EXPECT A CATHOLIC BUT- MY AND I ANTICIPATE THAT YOU TO THOSE DEPART WILL AT LEAST A TWO YEAR ON BOARDING. WHAT SYSTEMS NEED TO BE EITHER INTEGRATED I'M AND HOW MUCH WORK WILL BE INVOLVED IN THAT WE WILL BE COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. BOTH IN A LEVELS WITHIN. IF WE SPECIFIC ASKS I'M YOU KNOW. EITHER OUR OUR VERY DEPART NEEDED RESOURCES WE WOULD GO THROUGH THE BUDGETING PROCESS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ULTIMATELY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. SO WHO WE WANT TO BE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FINISH THE EXISTING FISCAL PROJECT WITH THE SCOPE- THERE IS THERE IS A GREAT UPON WHEN WE DO WITH THE AYE ALLEN JUST LIKE HER WITH TO THE DEPARTMENTS. WE'LL BRING TO PLEDGES. ADD ON TO THAT MADAM CHAIR I JUST JUST TO CLARIFY- THIS DISCUSSION OF DEFERRED DEPARTMENTS I THINK SOMETIMES GETS. BASE A LITTLE BIT NOW AND THAT THESE THE FOR DEPARTMENTS WERE INTENDED TO BE DEFERRED ALL ALONG THE DATA SAID MAY. TEN TWELVE YEARS AGO THE ONSET OF THIS PROJECT I AND THE REASON I WAS AND. NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED- THAT THE THAT DECISION WAS BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS TWO FOLD ONE WHEN WE ARE YOU HELP PART OF THE TIME ARE YOU SURPRISED SOURCE TO WITH BUDGET IS A LARGE ENTERPRISE RESOURCE I'M AND HAVE A COUPLE THE WORD IN THE PLAN. THOSE I. ENDS IN CRASH. AND DECIDED THAT THOSE ENTITIES OF SCARED WHEN ANOTHER ENOUGH IN IN A SCI THAT IT WAS IN A BEST INTEREST AGO PROCEED BECAUSE IT THEY COULDN'T WAIT OR TEN FOR ALL THE ONLINE AND SO IN THAT THIS IS AT THAT TIME WAS ONCE WE GET OF CAL. THEIR DATA IS IN FISCAL IT'S IN THE NUMBERS YOU SEE IT'S IN THE BUDGET NUMBERS THERE'S NO MISSING PIECES THEIR ATTENDANCE IS WENT WHEN DOES MY BUSINESS THE CONVERT ON OVER MEN AND SO THE THIS ONE I AM IN. ONE AND TWO IT'S THE DEPARTMENTS DID THAT UP TO REFRESH THEIR EXIST SYSTEM THAN PUT MONEY IN. MY TIME TO CUT OVER BURKE. TOLD IN FISCAL AND STUFF I JUST WANT THE DOT WAS THE PLAN ALL AND THAT PART IS NOT A- IS NOT A EIGHT. IN THEY WERE WE'RE NOW IT POINT WE WERE STARTING TO INVESTIGATE. WHEN DO YOU KEEP THAT UP AND WE WILL THE GLIDE PATH BRING YOU TO THOSE. GOOD I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT HE- BECAUSE I. BECAUSE I WAS PART OF THIS HEARING. BUT THAT THE IT THE THEY WERE ROOM. IN THE A P. R. A. AND SO IT. NOT PART OF THAT SO I. THINK YOU FOR THAT HIS. LESSON IN. YOU HAVE. RIGHT NO HE- GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED I. JUST HAVE. MORE QUESTIONS THEN ALL OF I'LL- MOVE ON TO. THE WITH THE WITH THE- SPEED OF THE INFORMATION THAT COMES OUT OR- ANY NEW NEEDS THAT THEY MAY HAVE GIVEN THAT PROJECT HAS NOW PRODUCED A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION AND THEY ACTUALLY WANT MORE INFORMATION SO ONE WOULD BE AN ANTICIPATED RIGHT MANAGEMENT IS WHEN THINGS. THAT WE DON'T DO VERY WELL- IT IF YOU IF YOU USE A LEAN SIX PROCESS YOU CAN REALLY FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU HAVE ALL THESE. ENERGY CENTER SPENT THAT IT GO TO WASTE THAT CREATE A LOT OF BUREAUCRACY SO I APPRECIATE THAT THAT COMMENT BUT- IT BACK AT DEPARTMENT ISSUES. SO SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS FOR- WERE A LOT OF A WE GET THE BULK OF THE KIDS COMING INTO MY SERVICE CENTER FROM OUR- ARE. TO HOW DO I DO SO VERSUS. IN DON'T HAVE. WE HAVE WE'RE ALMOST AT ZERO TICKETS THAT ARE ON SYSTEMS IT'S VERY LOW NUMBERS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HOW TO QUESTIONS WHAT WE HAVE DONE TO HELP THOSE TO COMMENCE IS. REDUCED A CHAP BRINGING WITH IT SOME ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND WE TAUGHT AT FIRST AB THE PROCUREMENT WORLD BECAUSE OUR HIGHEST VOLUME OF TICKETS AND HIGHEST VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS ON THIS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GETTING IS. OUT ABLE TO ANSWER AND HAS ELIMINATED AND NOT THE MAJORITY AGAIN OF THE QUESTION THAT WE HAD BEEN SEEN ON A ROUTINE BASIS BUT WE ALL THOUGHT THE ROW COUNT RECEIVER PEBBLE AND SO NOW WE WILL BE DOING AS FAR AS THE YOU'RE IN A- NOW. AND QUESTION ONE OF IT TAKES. BACKERS AN EMAIL WHEN IT'S HOW TO CA. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO PUT ON SCREEN. ON IT. ON TWO DIFFERENT SO YOU ARE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE PAGE YOU DON'T READ ANOTHER SCREEN TO IT WOULD IT IT TO REACH OUT TO US SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF THOSE OP ABOUT. HAVE DONE IN THIS THIS REGARD. WELL IT. PRIVATE SECTOR YOU SOME SYSTEMS SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT'S STRUGGLE IS WE DO REQUIRE A EVERY DETAIL AMOUNT OF INFORMATION. AND THAT IS IN ORDER FOR US ON THE FLIP SIDE TO PROVIDE A LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE. DOING TO LOOK TO HELP ADDRESS THAT IN IS IN OUR OUR PIPELINE NOW IS SOME ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION. SO THAT VERY CERTAIN THINGS AND I'LL I'LL USE A PO EXAMPLE WHERE YOU ENTER. YOUR AND- MR STORM HOUSES MENTIONED THAT HE- STATION ALL THE WAY THROUGH. THE PAYMENT TO THE THAT THE THAT CHECK CORRECT TO CHECK. ALONG THE WAY THERE ARE MANY SCREEN WHICH ARE ENTERING SO THE SAME INFORMATION YOU NEED THAT PO NUMBER YOU NEED THE ORDER NUMBER NEEDS TO BE CROSSED SO WE'RE LOOKING AT. ABOUT A- INTO TO PULL THAT WE HAVE A- GROUP THAT YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY. WHEN I WOULD IS THE SAME THAT WAS HERE. THE WHERE WITH A CUSTOMER. BASE OF FIFTY TWO PARTS PARTICIPATING OF. DEBT SEA SENATORS. IS TO THE WERE CAST RIGHT NOW WE HAVE. SUB WORKING GROUP. CHAIRED BY DIFFERENT. AGENCIES REALLY- ONE IS ON THE CONFIDENTIAL PH I. INFORMATION. ON WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE IN THE SYSTEM BUT HOW THEY IN TURN INFORMATION THIS WORK BY THE CONTROLLER. IT SAFE MANNER WITHOUT PUT IT INTO A FINANCIAL SYSTEM I THEN WE ALSO HAVE. ON ROBOTICS OF SADDAM XIN WITH BEING WANTED BY. AT IT WAS. WITH HEALTH CARE AND THEN THE THIRD ONE IS ARTIFICIAL AND- ALLEGIANCE AND THEN GOING IN THERE IS ALSO THE REPORTING. CAPABILITIES FLYING SO WE ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE VENUES FOR THE DEPARTMENTS TO COME IN AND- AND THEN WE GO THROUGH A PRIORITY SHOULD PROCESS IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENTS HELP. PRIORITIZE THROUGH THE CIC WHAT. HAVE TO BE TO PLAY FIRST SECOND THIRD WHAT ARE THOSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE POINTS THAT RIGHT NOW IT IS. I EIGHT ENTRY THEY WERE GONNA STREAMLINE BUT THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE IS THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE FISCAL SYSTEM AND WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE LEGACY I'M SYSTEM TECH ROLLERS OFFICE CASH BOOK OF RECORD WHERE MY RULE AND SO WE IN THIS ABSTRACT THE DISTANCE ALL SHE JULY THAT. I DID YOU WELL FOR INSTITUTE RECONCILIATION SELL WITH I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD SO WITH THAT CAN CAN YES OKAY THAT COMING ON I'M YOU MEAN JUST IN THIS FISCAL YEAR WE'RE HOPING TO SEE SOME IMPROVEMENTS WILL SUPPORT IT TOMATO RECONCILIATION. ARE THOSE THE AGAIN WILL ASSIST AND- THE REMAINING FUNCTIONALITY IS A TO POINT. VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND ONE LAST QUESTION BECAUSE I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM- SMALL BUSINESSES THAT DO. WORK FOR THIS. HAVE CONTRACTS. THAT THE- DISPERSAL OR THAT THE CHECKS IN THE MAIL- ARE VERY DELAYED AND- AND I AND I JUST WONDER IF THAT AB RESULT OF HAVING MOVED TO THE SYSTEM OR WHETHER IT- IT'S OLD INFORMATION I DID A FULL OF TOURS THE- IT SAYS. AND ISSUE IS THAT THEY THEY EXPECT A LOT OF RESOURCES UP FRONT IN ORDER TO. UNDER THE CONTRACT AND THEN THEY THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT THAT MATERIALS THAT THEY USE AND THEN THEIR THEIR CHECKS ARE ARE SIGNIFICANT DELAY AND OF MY AND THAT IT USED TO BE VERY CLOSE. BEFORE BUT NOW IT KING A LOT. I WONDER IF YOU IF YOU'VE GOT SOME INSIGHT WE SHOULD JUST WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT. IT'S THREE D. YES. I DON'T KNOW IF AND KATHY WANTS TO COME UP AND HELP ME WITH THIS FROM THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE I KNOW THAT WE WERE HAVING ISSUES- OR KLAY WITH WITH JUST. THINGS LIKE GETTING IN THEIR TAX FORMS ARE TO. BE SURE THAT WE MOVED IT CONSOLIDATED BEEN FILED IT. BIG YOU MIGHT BE STAPLES BUT THE STATE HAD TEAM DIFFERENT STATE. WE HAVE IT IN ONE. THESE ARE UP IS. YEAH AND THEN OPERATE I'M FOR FRIENDS. NEARLY OUT FROM THIS. GIVE MADAM CHAIR IN COMMITTEE. AT KATHY LEE OUT WITH A STICK OFFICE BUSINESS A THEN ON THE ESCAPE POD. AT THIS GUIDED TO THE WAY WE DO ISSUE VENDOR PAYMENTS- AS MARIAN JUST READ IT WE DO HAVE TO- FOR PROCESS WE HAVE A CENTRAL US. I'LL ONCE APPROVED AT THE DEPARTMENT DOES RECEIVE A INVOICE THEY UTILIZE THE INVOICE TO DETERMINE THE SCHEDULE DUE DATE- THE DATE THAT THAT THAT PAYMENT IS GOING TO GET MADE. PREVIOUSLY WHEN I SEE OVER THE CLAIM AND YOUR SCO WOULD PROCESS IT AND THE PAYMENT WOULD BE ISSUE. THAT PROCESS HAS CHANGEDWITH THE DEPARTMENT NOW IDENTIFYING THAT DATE ON THAT WHEN THEY START SETTING UP THE INVOICE. DATE THEY POP IT THAT DAY. AND WHEN THAT AND THAT'S GONNA DRIVE THE ASH THE ISSUANCE OF THE CHECK. IS NO LONGER ON A SEAT SO IF IT. IS IN A. IT IS ON THE DEPARTMENT TO KEY IN THAT INFORMATION CORRECTLY INTO OFFICE GAL AND SCHEDULE THAT PAYMENT DATE OKAY THAT'S VERY HELPFUL SO LET ME JUST- ASK A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS. AS I RECALL THERE ARE PENALTIES. FOR A INVOICE CURRENT INDUSTRY. TIME NEARLY LATE THEY WERE PAYING A LOT OF ALLIED IN THOSE FINE- IS DOES THE SYSTEM ALLOW YOU TO LOOK AT THAT AND TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW GET. WE GET THE MONEY SIR I'M IN MY CAN FRAME ARE THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND I WAS A DURING THE DAYS WHEN OUR BUDGETS WERE SO LATE THAT. A FIRST. SOME THIS IS. IN OUT OF AND SO AT THE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL I. FOR US TO TAKE OF TRACK THAT JUST TO SEE WHAT TO ARE A PROBLEM AND WHETHER THAT TO IN A OF RESOURCE. JUST DOWN NOT UP ON THAT PRETTY FUNCTION SO I'M I'M OBVIOUSLY CAN ABOUT THAT AND WE HAVE MADE SURE THAT WE'RE WERE WE'RE REALLY. MAINTAINING THE- OF THE STAY BY. WE REALLY AREN'T THE DEEP HE BUSINESS BUT IF WORD THEN GONNA PUT AT RISK. BECAUSE WE CAN'T CHECKS UP ENOUGH IT'S- YEAH SO A QUICK EXAMPLE IT. CAN FOR THAT CONTROLLER SHE GETS UP THE CHEWING CALL ON HER THE VENDOR PAYMENTS AS WELL. THE WILL GET A CALL FROM THERE SO. THAT WAS IT IF I TO LOOK. UNDER THAT YOU WANT TO SEND OVER WE CAN RESEARCH AS A WHAT INVOICES WE HAVE WHAT THE STATUS OF IT WHERE IS IT AT IT. IF IT'S THE WITH THE DEPARTMENT IF IT'S WITH A C. APPROVED. OR WHAT THIS GET A DUTY IS ON THAT AS WELL THAT EXCELLENT I WILL DO I'LL GET ALL INFORMATION SO THAT. AND TAKE GET IT AND- HAPPY TO HELP. THANK YOU THANK YOU- POP UP HERE AND GIVING US YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY. UP QUESTION. COMMITTEE YES SIR. THANK YOU FOR WERE REACHING OUT THIS YEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN BEFORE AND- MY INQUIRIES ARE NOT WASTE CRITICAL OF VALUE MORE RECENTLY REACHED OUT. IT'S BASED ON A LONG AND SAD HISTORY OF TECH APPLICATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES COST THE STATE AND ITS CITIZENS. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AN EYE FOR VENDORS ALSO WHO HAVE MIND THE STATE TREASURY FOR THEIR OWN BENEFITS. NUFF SAID WITH THAT. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES THE CHAIR JUST SPOKE OF THE SMALL. BUSINESS LOW PAY. TRUST GOVERNMENT YOU NAME THE AGENCY AND THERE'S A LOT OF SLOW PAY GOING ON EVERY SINGLE AGE BUT I THINK IT'S TIME FOR MANY THINGS TO NOT BE TOLERATED WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES IF THEN THE AGENCY THAT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY. TO SEE THAT THAT EXPERT IF THEY DON'T DO THAT AND THEY CONTINUE TO NEGLECT WHAT PENALTY DOES ANY STATE AGENCY PAY IN A WAY. UNDER THE PROMPT PAYMENT ACT% THERE ARE PENALTIES THAT THOSE DEPARTMENTS PAY FISCAL PENALTIES OR WHAT SCHOOL PENALTIES ARE THEY EVER LET DO WE HAVE A REGULATORY OF HOW MUCH. I BELIEVE THAT. BUT YEAH. I DON'T I'M TRYING TO THINK OF WHICH OF MY PARTNERS WOULD HAVE THAT GOVERNMENT IT'S GOT A NUMBER. OF KNOWS ME. HI AGAIN IT'S AND ON THE DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION AT THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES SO WE DO PRODUCE A REPORT ANNUALLY OF LATE PAYMENT. AT DEPARTMENT INCURRED- IT DOES GET POSTED ON THE DIGEST WEBSITE- SO THAT GIVES INSIGHT INTO THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WE HAVE HAD. A LATE PAYMENTS- I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S POSTED JUST YET OF FOR THIS YEAR WE JUST GOT IT THROUGH THE APPROVALS- BUT IT DOES SHOW. DEPARTMENT THE ONE TEN THE DOLLAR BUT IS THAT THE- TEMPORARY EMBARRASSMENT WHICH WOULD. THIRTY SECONDS THAT DEPARTMENT. YES I'M A WHAT OF. AND FROM THE TGS PERSPECTIVE I DO NOT KNOW THAT THERE'S AN ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY SEEM MANAGER THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS IT DID SO EASILY IGNORED AND GOVERNMENT. TO THE LARGER THAN QUESTION AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CLARIFICATION BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE DON'T HAVE A CONSEQUENCES. AND THERE ARE IT'S ALL MORE IMPORTANT NOW AS WE ARE CONTINUING TO EMBARK ON THESE BILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS THAT THE- LEGISLATURE THE SERVICE OF THERAPY. AND THE SUPERSITE. YEAH I CERTAINLY CONCUR WITH YOUR CONCERNS THAT I'M SURE THIS WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT IT. AND AS WE PROCEED WITH THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET. I AM GOING TO SUGGEST THAT WE WORK TOGETHER WITH ANALYST. WITH THE DEPARTMENT PERIOD FOR SOME VERY PRO SCRIPTED. LIMITING THE LANGUAGE. DEFINING WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT WILL GET DONE AND IN FACT WHAT CONSEQUENCES ARE. AND FURTHER THAT WE INCORPORATE COST SAVINGS THAT WAS JUST SUMMARILY DISMISSED A LITTLE BIT AGO WE DON'T WORRY ABOUT COST SAVINGS. EVERYONE OF THESE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO P. WEISS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE JUSTIFIED. AS TO WHAT SEC THINGS WILL BE A BRING OR WHAT EFFICIENCIES WILL BE WROUGHT BY THAT. WHY BEING PLACED IN THE BUDGET. BECAUSE THAT'S A PERMANENT. OBLIGATION OF THE STATE IN THOSE POSITIONS. A VERY HARD TO GET RID UP SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE IN OUR LANGUAGE HERE. ANOTHER ONE WOULD BE DE MINING COMPLETION WHAT DOES COMPLETION I MEAN BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN A PROBLEM WITH OUR- OKAY GERMAN OF HIGH TECH. PROJECTS THERE IS NO COMPLETION IT JUST GOES ON IN IN FOR NIGHT OF. SOME COMPANY COMES UP WITH SOME NEW. THE VICE SOME NEW SHINY OBJECT AND- WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT NOW THAT'S THE STATE OF THE ART WELL OKAY GONNA HAVE TO HAVE AN OVER OPEN AND- KEEP GOING ON WE JUST KEEP CHASING THE NEWEST. LOGY COMING UP EXCUSES THE WANT TO BE HARD NOSED MADAM CHAIR THIS TIME IN THIS BUDGET FINALLY. IN THE STATUTE WE WILL WORK WITH THE LEDGE ANALYST ON THIS ON THAT PRO SCRIPTED LIMITING AND CONSEQUENCES WRITTEN AND STE SHAVINGS CONSIDERATION LANGUAGE THAT WILL MAKE US FINALLY. WORLD THAT WE'RE GONNA BE RICH. WITH THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS EMPLOYING AND DEPLOYING ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. BY T. PROJECT IF WE MAY THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN SENATOR DR SO. THANK YOU WE SHOULD THE LA OWES QUESTION WHEN YOU SAID WHAT WHAT DID THE LEGISLATION IN TEN. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE SORT OF USE THAT FOR SOME OF US COME LATER IS WHAT WAS THE INTENTION AND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. RIGHT WHAT A SPECIFIC AND I IMAGINE THAT A LOT OF IT WAS NOT SPECIFIC IT WAS JUST LIKE OKAY GO DO AND THEN YOU START DOING THAT THEN YOU FIGURE OUT THAT THERE IS A LOT MORE TO IT BUT- MUCH AS YOU CAN. THIS UNDERSTOOD. WHAT THE AND WAS AND- AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WAS A TIME FRAME. UP IN A SHORT SUMMARY BECAUSE I SORT OF LOSE THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF A OF A LOT OF THINGS. I'M I KNOW. FIRST YEAR WHEN THE ISSUE CAME UP OF COST SAVINGS. OF IT WAS A IT WAS A REAL QUESTION MARK BECAUSE WE WERE- EITHER NIELSEN SAID. APPROVING ADDITIONAL STAFF FROM DEPARTMENTS WERE FISCAL WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING EMPLOYED. YOU KNOW WE QUESTIONED WAS THIS A TEMPORARY BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO TRAIN BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO CHANGE THE CULTURE WHICH I UNDERSTAND WAS OF A BIG ISSUE OF SO I DON'T THINK WE CAME UP WITH A FINAL YES OR NO RIGHT I'D IS THE STAFF GOING TO STATE HERE FOREVER OR ARE YOU TEMPORARILY TO TRACK. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE COST SAVINGS AND AS I RECALL THAT WAS NOT A VERY IT WAS NOT A VERY CLEAR ANSWER SIMPLY BECAUSE I SINGLE NEVER WAS YOU WERE DOING THEN YOU DIDN'T KNOW- BUT I DO THINK IT'S A VALID TO SAY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. ISN'T IT THIS WILL RESULT IN COST SAVINGS OR IT'S NOT A LET'S JUST FACE IT LETS A LET'S DIG INTO IT- BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF IT WAS A ENGINE CULTURE AND I APPRECIATE ALSO YOUR REF THIS STRAIGHT TEAM. THE TEAM THAT WE ABLE TO THESE ALL THE- BECAUSE I AM. THAT WAS ALSO IS. LAST YEAR IS HOW YOU DRESS THAN. THERE'S SO. FROM THE SMALL SO YOU MIGHT TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE IS THIS STRIKE TEAM. OF SO- SEE WHAT ELSE IN HERE. IN. IF I MAY I'LL START AN ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE GS BUT IT A HIGH LEVEL- WHAT IS AS I MENTIONED WE SAW STRUGGLES IN A COUNTY JOBS AND IT IS WE BROUGHT WAVES THE DEPARTMENTS ON SOME OF THE SMALLER DEPARTMENTS WERE IN FACT- THE WONDERSTRUCK MOST AND SOME OF THE BIGGEST MOST COMPLEX ONES IT WAS THE EXTREME YES IN SORT OF A HIGH LEVEL AND SO DO. CONTACT THEM THIS WILL SERVICES YOU SEE ADDRESS AND THEY THEY RUN A CONTRACT A BUDGET SHOP ACCOUNTING SHOPPERS SMALL LIKE BOARDS COMMISSIONS AND DEPARTMENTS I DON'T HAVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOUSE AND THEY DO IT AS OF THE FOR SERVICE SO WHAT WE FOUND TIMES I GOT REALLY GOOD AT FISCAL. WE SET UP WHAT. WAS. THERE FIGURE IT OUT AND WE HAVE SOME OF SMALL DEPARTMENTS LET'S LET'S ENCOURAGE THEM COME INTO THE FOLD THAT BURDEN OFF THEIR PLATE SHIFTED TO BGS WHOSE ESTABLISH SOME EXPERTISE HERE AND GO FIND SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT WITH THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT THAT ONE OF THE PIECES OF THAT WAS WAS EXPANDING THE RESOURCES AND THEIR CFS SHOP MEN AND BUT THERE'S A GROWTH THE HAS TO HAVE AND HOW YOU GOT A STAFF OF YOU GOT TO HIRE THE PEOPLE THE NEGATIVE TRAIN THEM UP. THEY DO. THE WAY. THEY CAN THE- IT WAS WORTH. TIME WITHOUT CABLE THAT THERE'S A NEED OUT THERE FOR THE PARMA THAT DON'T NEED TO CURRENTLY TRANSITION THAT WERE IN THE NEED. BUT USE SOME REAL HANDS ON ON TEACHING THEIR PEOPLE THE ROPES SHE SHOULDER HAND HAND AND SO THAT WAS THE CONS OF THE STRC TEAM IN THAT'S IN THE B. C. P. THE MINISTER IS TO SAY AN I BELIEVE SPEND THAT MONEY REGION AS WELL. UNDER MOST OF. I THINK YOU YOU ACTUALLY WILL COVER IT. THANK YOU TO SAY I DO A- THE PROGRESS YOU MAY. WE'RE IN A VERY PLACE TODAY FROM WHERE WE WERE A YEAR AGO AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND WHAT YOU'VE HAD TO GO THROUGH TO GET HERE- I THINK YOU KINDA GET BEAT UP. A LOT BUT YOU'RE TOUGH. AND THESE ARE ALL LEGITIMATE ISSUES AND QUESTIONS WERE NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY HEY HOW WOULD HAVE WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN A FEW MINUTES TO COME IN AND- SUMMARIZE IT ALL. BUT I THINK YOU GET THE DRIFT OF. WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SO THANK YOU. LET ME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY AND FOR GIVING AYE AYE I THINK A VERY THOROUGH UPDATE ON WHAT IS A REALLY COMPLICATED PROJECT- AND IT YOU KNOW CHANGE IS NEVER EASY I KNOW THAT WHEN EVERY TELL DEPARTMENTS ARE GONNA HAVE TO CHECK THEY DO THINGS IT'S- AN EASY. AND I. IT'S KIND OF IN IN AN- IN THE MAKING IT EASIER FOR SOME OF THE SMALLER. BUT DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE THE FIRST IN LINE FOR SITTING Q. I TO GET THROUGH AND FROM MY POSITION IT SOUNDS LIKE- WITH SO LET ME JUST SAY THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO- DOCKED ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT INCLUDE THE TRACKING OF THE MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONALITY AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT INTERFACING LEGACY SYSTEM. HE SURE THAT. THERE IS THE SAME THAT IT'S THAT'S BEING PRODUCED FOR THE DEPARTMENTSRIGHT IN THIS NEW SYSTEM- BUT ALSO- THIS SECONDARY WAS THAT THAT THE REMAINING DEPARTMENTS OPERATE ON FISCAL AND WE I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT MAY BE A DIFFERENT PROCESS- AND YO YO THROUGH. THE ANALYSIS OF WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR OWN SYSTEMS AND WHETHER IT IT'S COST EFFECTIVE TO COME TO COME ON BOARD AND I AS SOON THAT'LL BE A REPORT IN THE FUTURE THE END THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING AT THAT POINT AND WE WILL BRING BACK LEGISLATURE FOR. CONSIDER HIM BEFORE PROCEEDING OBVIOUSLY RIGHT AFTER. JUST WILL WORK YES OKAY JUST ONE MORE QUESTION ON THE DEFERRED DEPARTMENTS UP IS THERE IS A FIX FOR IT. FOR THOSE DO YOU KNOW WHAT INFORMATION IS TO GET SOME. OR ALL IS THAT SORT. WHAT THAT IS THE IN OUR THAT WE ARE DOING I'M NOW THAT WE'VE STARTED THANK YOU FOR BUT THERE WAS NO A NO I CERTAIN TIME NOW IT WAS JUST HAD TO WE WERE THAT BY THE TIME THE THOSE ENHANCEMENTS TO THEIR SYSTEM. PLACE TENDS THAT WE THAT WE CAL WOULD BE AN ADDITION TO TAKE THEM. A INSTEAD OF HAVING. THAT SECONDARY. AT THE AND- EXEMPT IS EXAM THERE'S LIKE A- NO. WE THE- OR ANYTHING. THIS POINT IT'S NOT. THE LEGISLATURE COULD. THAT WHEN. THEY MAKE THAT. WHAT LEFT ANY ELSE CORRECTLY TEMPLI. RACKED THOSE ARE YOU KNOW THE USED SYSTEM THE LEGISLATURE. THE WHOLE COUNCIL ACTUALLY I'M TO MY WE CAME IN ASKED LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE. THEY HAD ASKED TO MEND OUR- AND WE- AND A BC P. WAS APPROVED. WE ATE IT. I'M READY. HE BROUGHT THE ONTO OUR SYSTEM SO. IN THE THAT. I'M SO LIKE THIS WE WOULD AND- NOW WE ARE. THEY'RE NOT ON OUR IN OUR FOR AN HOUR OR ANY. FROM MY- THIS IS CAN I GET A LIST OF EACH OF THOSE YES ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. WELL MAKES EVERYBODY GETS IT A COPY OF THAT LIST CENTER NIELSEN YES THE LAST OBSERVATION YOU KNOW WE- NORMALLY GET THE WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU RESPONSES. FROM AGENCIES. FOR AND THESE HEARINGS OVER THE DECADES AND I KIND OF MADE. THE LEGEND OF MYSELF IN ONE HEARING SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN I TOLD THE AGENCY PERSON YOU KNOW YOU FILL THE ROOM WITH WORDS DELICIOUS WONDERFUL WORDS THEY'RE ALL FALLING TO THE GROUND AND TING LIKE SNOW. WE DON'T NEED THAT AND INSTEAD OF YOU GETTING BACK TO US IN THIS BUDGET I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WEEK GETTING TO YOU. AND SAYING THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO BE. INSTEAD OF THE OTHER WAY AROUND YOU TELLING US HOW IT WORK FOR YOU WE WANT TO TELL YOU HOW IT WILL WORK FOR US I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN HOW WE BUDGET. PARTICULARLY IN THIS VERY INSENSITIVE INSENSITIVE AND SENSITIVE AND COSTLY AREA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR NIELSEN- AT I THINK IT THAT WAS INFORMATION THAT YOU'LL GET LESS- SO I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU GET IT TO THE COMMITTEE AND THEN WE'LL SHARE IT WITH EVERYONE- WE I DO NEED TO ASK IF THERE'S ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE. TO COME IN ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM TO COME TO MAKE. IN NO MEANT THAT CAN. OUR OUR- HIS **** OUR REVIEW HERE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. VERY. TO NEED ABOUT ON THAT. SO OUR TASK TODAY MEMBERS IS TO- THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO ADOPT ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE TRACKING THE PROGRESS OF THE CASH MEANT MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONALITY TROUBLE MOTION ON THAT. YES SOME OF THERE IS THERE IS A MOTION. OKAY AND- THE ROAD PLEASE CENTER CABALLERO BY CENTERING ELSON ENERGY DRAWS A- VERY GOOD MOTION PASSES WE MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. WELCOME AND THIS IS THE CONTRACTED FISCAL SERVICE WORKLOAD INCREASE SO WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A DISCUSSION ON THIS SO YOU MAY PROCEED. Q. MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS INTEREST INVOLVED AGAIN WITH APARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES- FOR THE FIRST ITEM BEFORE YOU CONTRACTORS. CONTRACTED FISCAL SERVICES WORKLOAD INCREASE- THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING TWO POINT TWO EIGHT MILLION AN ONGOING EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY AND FIFTEEN PERMANENT POSITIONS PROVIDE ACCOUNTING SERVICES FOR NEW CLIENTS AND ESTABLISH THE ACCOUNTING STRIKE FORCE THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE- PREVIOUS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. THE FOR NEW CLIENTS WERE LOOKING TO TAKE ON IT AS OF JULY FIRST INCLUDE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN FAMILIES COMMISSION OTHER LIES IN ITS FIRST FIVE. CALIFORNIA YOU NEED COMMISSION. WOMEN RELEASED FOR AND THE COMMISSION IN PACIFICA. AMERICAN AFFAIRS WHICH IS A NEW COMMISSION CREATED BY THIS LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR. NINE OF THE POSITIONS WE DEDICATE TAKING ON THIS FOR CLIENTS MITCHELL SIX POSITIONS WOULD BE CREATED TO PROTECT TO DEVELOP THE TASK FORCE THAT WE'VE- WE'VE LAID OUT IN THE PC P. WITH THE IDEA BEHIND A TASK FORCE PROVIDE. DIRECT HANDS ON ACCOUNTING SUPPORT SERVICES DEPARTMENTS WHO ARE IN NEED OF THAT- WHICH COULD BE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS PERHAPS THERE BEHIND PERHAPS THEY HAD A LEAVE OF ABSENCE PARTICULAR IN SMALLER MEDIUM SIZED APARTMENTS WHEN YOU HAPPEN RETIREMENT OR ONE OR TWO PEOPLE KEEP PEOPLE OUT. THERE COUNTY CAN GET STOCK AND SO THE IDEA IS PRIDE NOT JUST IN TIME ACCOUNTING SUPPORT SERVICES- FOR THOSE DEPARTMENTS IN NEED WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. ANY QUESTIONS OF. MISTER STURM FELL. EXCUSE ME AT COMMENTS FROM THE ALEJO HOLLINGER SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE NO PROBLEM I SEE WERE RECOMMENDING APPROVING THE SIX POSITIONS FOR THE STRIKE TEAM ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS RATHER THAN ON ON ON GOING IT SAYS THAT AS IS PUT BY THE- ANY CONCERNS WERE THE- POSITION JUST FOR. A TERM RESOURCES FOR THE STRIKE TEAM I'M IS THAT WE THINK THAT THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LEVEL OF WORK FLOW THAT WILL MATERIALIZE BUT ALSO WE THINK IT CAN CAN ENHANCE OVERSIGHT OVER ON THIS CRITICAL AREA AS WE'VE HEARD A LOT AND- IN THE LAST FEW A FEW MINUTES ABOUT FISKE OUT AND THE IMPORTANT THAT PROJECT AND ALL THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AND THE PROP. ONLY ONE OVER AND OKAY VERSES ARE COMING FROM HIDING IT OF INDIVIDUAL CONDITIONS TO DEPARTMENT HOW MUCH WE OF DID YOU. AND SO WE THINK THAT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS OTHER DEPARTMENTS WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF HOW THESE RESOURCES ARE BEING EMPLOYED HOW THEY- INTERACT WITH THE OTHER RESOURCES THE LEGISLATURE'S APPROVED. I'M REALLY WHAT THE ON GOING THE MIGHT BE IF ANY BECAUSE WORK ALSO BETTER UNDERSTAND PROBABLY THE TIMELINE FOR BRINGING ON ADDITIONAL DEPARTMENTS ON THE FIFTH. SYSTEM VERY GOOD THANK VERY MUCH THIS IS THEM THAT'S RECOMMENDED OLD OPEN IS THERE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. OF THE COMMITTEE. YES OULD YOU RESPOND TO THE ISSUE OF THE STRIKE TEAM IN LINE YOU THINK I'M GOING. ALL RIGHT INTO. THIS IS SO THE BEFORE YOU IT'S FOR AS FOR PARTY RESOURCES CREE DISTRICT ARE. HAS BEEN TODAY THERE ARE DEPARTMENTS THE HELP AND WITH THE AGING WORK IN THE CARMEN FOR SINGS THE SERVICE NOW WE DON'T SEE THAT ISSUE. LEADING UP IN THE NEXT FEW. I'M A CERTAINLY OF RISK AND APPRECIATE IT WAS WRECKED ON THE. IF I COULD FOLLOW ON THAT ROAD. THE STE TEAM IS HOPING. AT MAKE THE ADDRESS FOR DEPART SAID OF HER CHALLENGES DE WHAT HOW DO YOU THAT. I MEAN IN TERMS OF THE FISCAL SO HOW DO YOU SEE THAT MOVING ON INTO THE FUTURE. SO THE IDEA BEHIND TEAM IS WAY IS THE PRICE IN THE TWO GETS REQUESTS FOR ON BASIS AND SOME OF THE TECH SUPPORT WHICH IS A PROGRAM FOR FISCAL PROVIDE OTHER IS DIRECT A SUPPORT WHICH IS THE TO FIND. OR A SEPARATE STATE OF SYSTEM. IS IN A SINGLE ORGAN. AND AT DO DIRECT ACCOUNT WITH A DEPARTMENT SIDE AND- I MY DISTRICT IN SERVICES I WE WOULD PROVIDE ACCOUNT ON A TEMPORARY BASIS TO THE- COUNTY SPORTS A. B. C. SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE DEPARTMENT. HELPING TO TRAIN AND SYSTEM SOLVE. WHATEVER ISSUE MAKING UP FOR ANY HURDLE ABOUT. LAST TWO YEARSAND I'VE ACTUALLY PROVIDED SOME- WHEN WE HAD THAT THE STAFF AND BAND WITH ON THE SIDE AT THIS POINT WE FEEL LIKE IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT DOES REQUIRE A PERMIT NEED. SO THAT DEPARTMENTS DON'T MIND BECAUSE ONCE YOU BEHIND IT'S MUCH HARDER TO COME BACK. YEAH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. IF NOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT INFORMATION- WE ARE GONNA BE HOLDING THIS OPEN IS THERE ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME. MAN AS I SAID WE'RE GONNA BE HOLDING THIS ONE OPEN SO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE WHICH IS THE CAPITAL OUTLAYS JESSE UNRUH BUILDING RENOVATION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS TO ME MY NAME IS JASON KENNEY ON THE DAILY DIRECTOR FOR REAL ESTATE SERVICES HERE DID YES- THIS PROJECT IS THE IS THE FIRST OF THREE BUILDING RENOVATION PROJECT BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING EACH PROJECT IS A DESIGN BUILD PROJECT. WHICH MEANS TO FACE IS A PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. AND THE ACTUAL DESIGN BUILD FACE- BEEPER WENT. PHASE FOR EACH OF THE THREE PROJECTS WERE APPROVED PREVIOUSLY SO WE'RE ASKING FOR THE TWO. AND INTO THE DESIGN BUILD PHASE. ALL THREE PROJECTS ROSS OF TEN YEARS. PLAN THIS IS THE FIRST ONE BEFORE IS THE JESSE UNDER BUILDING FOR CONTEXT- IT'S THE ONE OF THE TWO BUILDINGS IN THE ROUND ABOUT RIGHT OUTSIDE THE WEST WING OF THE CAPITOL AND% PART OF. THAT RIGHT. HISTORY I DON'T IN THAT IS MENTIONED IN THE AGENDA WELL- THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT VERY- THOUGH IT WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT OR SO IT IS A HISTORIC BUILDING- AND DISCOVER THE- OBJECT IS TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE RENOVATION TO ADDRESS. ISSUES INCLUDING LACK OF FIRE SPRINKLERS. BUILDING IS MISSING- SUFFICIENT EXITING STAIRS- IT IS ALSO TRUE PLEASE BUILDING SYSTEMS THAT WOULD BE ELEVATORS PLUMBING CIRCLE UNTIL. IN MECHANICAL. BUT TELECOMS LIKE. I BUILDING ALSO SO. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WHAT TREASON ISSUE SO I CAN'T BE MORE HAS MATTER THAN WE HAD ACTUALLY AT FIRST ANTICIPATED AS WELL ADDRESSING PDA ISSUES IN OUR OUR BUDGET REQUEST THERE WERE THREE OPTIONS AVAILABLE- WITH RESPECT TO THE CAPITAL FOUNTAIN ONE- OUR BASELINE WAS DO NOTHING TO- DEMOLISHED. FOR THREE TO RESTORE ORDER READ THE TAPE THE FOUNTAIN- WE- ONE THE RECORD SAYING THAT WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION RELATED FOUNTAIN FOR THE PROJECT WELL. KIND OF ANTICIPATING OF AND NOTING THAT THE LA DOES RECOMMEND OR COMMENTS IN THE- IN THE AGENDA WANTED TO JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- THE COST FOR THE PROJECT IT IS TRUE THAT- COMPARED. TO NISHA ASSUMPTIONS WITH PROJECT FOR LEGISLATURE IN THE FIRST PLACE COSTS HAVE GONE- THEIR NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THAT ONE- WORSENING CONDITIONS SO- THE TWO BIGGEST ONES FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. HAS MATT HANNAH WATER ISSUE IN BOTH. BOTH IS WERE SICK. WE'RE STILL EXPECT AND I PROCESS IT'S- GOT TWELVE CENTS HIGHER TO PRESSES. WE ARE ALL. INCREASE CAN. THANK YOU. ALSO ASSOCIATE TO INSTALL IN FACT IN THE ONE OF OUR LAW SECOND PROP AND RICHARD BOULEVARD WE HAD A CON DROP OUT OF THE COMPETITION OVER CONCERNS ON THE ELECTRICAL ESTIMATES- ADDITIONALLY I THINK IT'S A THE NOTE THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT IT'S- IN THIS BECAUSE OF COURSE OF COST LIKE I MENTIONED IS AT ABOUT A DOLLAR FIFTEEN A DOLLAR TWENTY IT'S OF A CASCADE OF. WE HAVE A TWO. PRETTY STRONG EFFORT I THINK TO GO THROUGH AND AS THESE COST WERE BEGINNING TO BE FLAGGED AS OVER ESTIMATE FROM PREVIOUS YEARS AS WE INVESTIGATED- TO ATTEMPT TO GET THEM DOWN WE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF VALUE HEARING THIS SIZE IDEAS- ON EACH PROJECT WHAT IS THE THAT'S A WE DID IT SUMMARILY RICH JUST FOR THINK TRANSPARENCY. A TOP AND THING RENOVATION TGS HAS DONE THAT IN PRIOR PROJECTS THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES THOUGH TO DOING SO UNLESS THE BUILDING ITSELF IS ABLE TO COME IN WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE IN THE FUTURE- SO YOU THE PARTITION MECHANICAL SYSTEM IN YOUR- NATION ON THAT THE AMOUNT. MISSIONAL COST AND REWORK AND TENANTS- PACKS ARE SIGNIFICANT- THINK ABOUT THIS ROOM FOR EXAMPLE MOST OF THE STUFF THAT YOU WOULD TOUCH AND RENOVATION IS EITHER BEHIND THE WALLS AND THE FLOOR TO CEILING INTO ENGLISH. IF YOU'RE DOING A BUILDING RENOVATION THE THINGS YOU ABSOLUTE ONE HIT AND THAT'S WHERE. THE MAJORITY OF THE CALL. OUR BUT WE DID. LOOK THANK FOR A WINDOWS ON THE BUILDING THE ORIGINAL WINDOWS WERE- WOOD FRAMED IN THE SEVENTIES THERE WAS PROJECT TO REPLACE THE NUMBER THE NUMBER FAILING THEY WERE ALUMINUM FRAME- WE COULD HAVE- ACOSTA DOING A REPLICA TO GO BACK THERE WOULD. WITHOUT ABOUT MILLION TO THE PROJECT WE ARE WAY X. WE REJECTED THAT OPTION- THERE ARE- OTHER AREAS WHERE- WE- LOOKED AT- POTENTIAL COST ISSUES. AND REJECTED STYLE ENGINEERING EXERCISES- ONE EXAMPLE IS HVAC SO RIGHT NOW IN THE BUILDING ALL THE MECHANICAL SYSTEMS ARE DECENTRALIZED FOR THE FLOOR- BRINGING UP TO THE ROOF BUILDING COSTS MARGINALLY MORE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS- BUT THE WHAT IT SAVES AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ENERGY EFFICIENCY NOISE ATTEND. FOR THE WAY THAT I GIVE THESE IS. SAY THAT WE THE COST ONE UP WE DID DEEP DIVE INTO THE IS IF THERE'S WAYS WE COULD CUT COSTS AND- WE FEEL OF THESE COSTS ARE- APPROPRIATE FOR THE PROJECT AND THE ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY THROUGH INTO A COMPREHENSIVE RENOVATION THE BUILDINGS. VERY GOOD- SHE- THE DETAIL ABOUT WHY THE COSTS HAVE GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO- WHAT. AND I APOLOGIZE IN THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD THAT THIS STANLEY MOSK COURTS BUILDING. ON NOT THE TOP OF MY HEAD SO THIS THIS THE- LABORING COURTS BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET- ON A COST PER SQUARE FOOT BASIS WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT WHAT WE ESTIMATED OUR INITIAL PROJECT FOR WE USE THAT AS AN ALONG. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE AND INTO THAT. AS THE COSTS COMING BACK HIGHER. OBVIOUSLY WE WANT BACK AND CHECKED. PREDICT JACK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DISCOVERED IS THAT RENOVATION WAS NOT. COMPLETE SO- THEY DID ABOUT 75% MECHANICAL WORK IN THE BUILDING INTERIOR BUILD OUT THAT HALF THE ELEVATORS NAY TOUCHED ABOUT TAP EIGHTEEN RESTROOMS. EVENTUALLY BE A- BILL FOR THAT THAT WILL DO THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE THINGS IN THE FUTURE. THE BUILDING ALSO HAS SOME UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS. OF A SOME OF IT IS OFFICE SPACE BUT THEY DO HAVE THE SIGNIFICANT STORAGE SPACE THAT RUNS UP TO THE BUILDING THE CALL STACKS- AND IT IS A MECHANICALLY SEPARATED. YEAH AND SO YOU COULD AND THEY DID- NOT TOUCHING THOSE SPACES AS THOROUGHLY AS THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE YOU COULD COME IN LATER MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS. NOW THE BUILDINGS ARE YOU HAVE SIMILAR AIR. RIGHT SIX. YEAH THE COURT ROOM IT'S NOT INDIVIDUAL OFF WHICH IS IN TERMS OF THAT MECHANICAL AND EVERYTHING ELSE. YOU'VE GOT TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEM SO I GET IT OKAY. LA THE DEPARTMENT SO MIGHT THAT YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT WHICH IS GREAT- WHICH IS FANTASTIC. COMMENDATIONS FOR THAT ALL THREE RENOVATION PROJECTS I'LL JUST GO OVER THEM ONCE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME RATHER THAN REPEATING MYSELF. I'M BASICALLY OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT REPORT AT BUDGET HEARINGS- ON DIFFERENT OPTIONS LEGISLATORS HAVE AND- HE REDUCING COSTS FOR THESE PROJECTS AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT ONE WE NOTED THAT THAT BUILDING PROJECTS WHEN THEY WERE INITIALLY PROPOSED WHICH WAS. THERE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETY. ANY WE ALREADY IN OUR AND ASSIST THEM TO BE BROUGHT. STE I PROJECT THE STATE HAD UNDERTAKEN I'M AND THEN THE PROJECTS AS YOU HEARD HAVE ENCOUNTERED SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS FOR HONORABLY. AND THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL- THE OTHER TWO BUILDINGS IT'S THAT LAST BUT% STILL NOT INSIGNIFICANT 17% BATES THAN AND RE SAYS. AT A FOR IN PER. COST SO THE COST ARE SEEING. ENOUGH AT WE THOUGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WHEN OUT WEATHER SO COME IN IT MAY WELL BECOME. THE SCOPE THESE- RENOVATIONS I'M BACK TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE BUDGETARY CONCERNS- WANTED ME LEGISLATURE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS CAPTION SAMPLE. OR SOMEONE. AND WEBER OR TO YOU SERVE MORE SHELVE. FORCE THAT HAS TRADE OFF IS THE AS THE- DEPARTMENT INDICATE. BUT THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING- AND I THINK DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW NOT EVERYTHING WAS TOUCHED IT IT. REALLY IS TO DO QUITE A GOOD JOB WITH THAT BUILDING AND IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO AND RIGHT AT HIM. I THINK WAS CONSTRUCTED WITHIN ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO OF THAT BUILDING AND SO IN TERMS OF LIKE. THE HISTORIC FEATURES IN THOSEKINDS OF THINGS THERE ARE SOME SIMILARITIES. SO THE- NOT. HM PROJECT AND TELL AN OF COURSE THERE'S A ITCH ACOSTA INCREASES FOR THAT BUT THERE AT ALL SOME CHANCE THAT WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT LESS OF A TIGHT CONSTRUCTION MARKET RIGHT NOW ALTHOUGH I THINK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF COURSE ARE CHANGING I'M PROBABLY BY DAY M. BUT- BUT- WITH THIS PROPOSAL FOR TOGETHER IT ANSWERED WHEN WE ANALYZED. USED ANYWAY THAT THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE LABOR VERY VERY IMPACTED IN THIS AREA THAT WAS AFFECTING SAYS WELL I'M AND OF COURSE THINGS LIKE FINISHES AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS CAN MAKE ON THE MARGINS ARE SO XIN. AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE LEGISLATURE. THOSE OPTION AND ANSWER KNOW THAT HER IS LOOKING TO MANY OF THEM THAT. ABOUT OUR OUR COMMENTS. VERY GOOD. ACTIONS THIRTY NIELSEN MADAM AS TO ONE PARTICULAR POINT THAT THE FOUNTAIN- AS I CONCUR WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION HERE AND I'M PROBABLY ONLY ONE AROUND IT'S BEEN HERE FOR. THE WHOLE DURATION OF RESTORATION THE OLD CAPITAL SIDE AND NOW THIS ONE. BUT ONE OF THE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS MAINTAINING THE HISTORICAL HERITAGE. OF THE INSTITUTION. WHEN THE CAPITAL HERE WAS DEEMED EARTHQUAKE VULNERABLE THERE WERE PROPOSALS TO TEAR IT ALL DOWN AND BILL TWO TWIN TOWERS THANK GOODNESS THE TIME. GREATER WISDOM AND ED HARRIS DO OUR HISTORIC HERITAGE PREVAILED. SAME THING ABOUT THE FOUNTAIN I THINK SIMILARLY OF THE- SOLD AUTO THE- HISPANIC OFFICER THAT'S OVER THERE NOW THE KIND OF RAISE THEIR OWN MONEY TO RESTORE THAT STATUTE BUT MY POINT IS THAT'S A PART OF THE HERITAGE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT DOES NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED AND CONTINUE TO BE A PART OF OUR HISTORY SO I SPEAK UP. THE FEDERATION THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S- HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR BUILDING AS WELL I AGREE WITH THE LA THAT. THAT THE ACT COURTS BUILDING WAS REALLY WELL DONE- YET IT AND I DID HAVE A OPPORTUNITY GOING TO THE PARTS OF THE BUILDING THERE. WERE NOT DONE AND- AND I UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE BUT- BUT THE EN ROUTE BUILDINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE INVITED THERE ALL THE TIME AND THERE'S A LOT OF TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF THAT BUILDING SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THE ENTIRE BUILDING NOT JUST PART OF IT. SENATOR DR SO YEMENI. SINCE NO QUESTIONS IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. ITEM I'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO PLEASE COME FORWARD. WHAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WOMEN AND MEMBERS LA RESTATE SOME WITH PRESERVATION SACRAMENTO AND WAYNE DONALDSON WITH PRESERVATION SOCIETY WE'VE FORMED A GROUP AND WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE TGS HAS APPROVED AND FARM PACKED REPORT AT APPROVED DEMOLITION OF. AND DID ITS REMOVAL UNTIL THEY GET DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON WHETHER IT SHOULD BE RESTORED. FOR OVER TEN YEARS THE FOUNTAIN HAS BEEN NEGLECTED AND WE'VE BEEN TOLD OVER THOSE TEN YEARS THAT THE FOUND WOULD BE RESTORED IN THE FUTURE POSSIBLY WITH THE UNDER A BUILDING WHEN IT WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE LIBRARY. OF BERRIES BUILDING. AND WE DISCOVERED IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT THE UNREAL RENOVATION WAS GOING TO DEMOLISH THE FOUNTAIN SO WE MET WITH DHS. AND HAVE LOOKED AT THE B. C. P.

DOCUMENTS AS WELL I'M MORE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THIRTEEN WHICH IS THE SECOND MEANT SACRAMENTO REGION RESOURCES BUILDING RENOVATION. THANK YOU I WILL- I'LL BE BRIEF ON ON THIS BUILDING THE NEXT ONE- THE SCOPE IS VERY SIMILAR TO PARA PROCONSUL THREE BUILDINGS THEY ARE FULL BUILDING RENOVATIONS- EACH BUILDING HAS SELECT DIFFERENT DIVISIONS THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS THE WORST THING IT JUST PORTFOLIO STATEWIDE- DOES INCLUDE A COUPLE OF UNIQUE OF OUR LIFE SAFETY DEFICIENCIES- AND SOME SIZE. SHOES ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. BACK TO THE GENERAL COMMENTS ON INCREASING COSTS THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE FOUND AS WE WERE GOING FOR THE PROJECT THEIR UNIQUE TO THIS ONE- INCLUDING- WORSENING STRUCTURE CONDITION- THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL FIRE LIFE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT WE FOUND FOR EXAMPLE. BY BUILDING EVERY EXISTS THERE NEEDS TO BE WHITE AND- ANSWERS GIVE SENSOR THING FOR. SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL DEFICIENT PERHAPS CORRECT TO A TO IT- ACCOUNT FOR SPLIT THE COST INCREASE- OUR APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THAT ISSUE THE BILL. WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT SIDE WERE COST ARE COSTLY APPROACH. THE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE ALSO. VALUE ENGINEERING ONE- SIMPLE EXAMPLE IS THE SIDE. ON THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED AS PART OF THE SEISMIC. SHIFT IN THE BUILDING- WE THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT- COST. APPROACHES DELIBERATELY PICKED NO THAT WAS MIDDLE THE ROAD COST- BUT EMPHASIZED LONGEVITY IN DURABILITY TO AVOID HAVING TO COME BACK AND DO WORK. FUTURE AS WELL AS- THE SAME. SEX I'M JUST AGAIN AN EXAMPLE OF CAR WHAT WE LOOKED AT TO MAKE SURE THESE COSTS ARE APPROPRIATE- AND- WE WORK NOT COSTING THE MOVE OR NOT. LOOKING THE BEST THE BEST OF THE BUILDINGS WERE WERE DOING THINGS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON LONGEVITY DURABILITY- AND BALANCING FIRST. WITH LONG TERM MAINTENANCE COSTS. NOTHING ADDITIONAL DAD YOUNG. THIS COMES IT OR WHAT WAS SAID BEFORE- AT THE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. IS THERE ANY- MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THAT COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE. NINE I DO I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION THIS IT WAS ALWAYS A CONSIDERATION OF DEMOLITION JUST THEM DEMOLISHING THIS- ANALYZED IT WAS ANALYZED- THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY. IT WAS REJECTED ONE- THE DEMOLITION COST- AND- ADDED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN TERMS OF IF YOU WERE BE BUILDING THESE ACTIONS WERE BUT IT SHOWS THINK OF A MORE EXPENSIVE TO DO THAT- THE OTHER ISSUE IS AT THE BUILDING PREDATES THE CAPITAL PROTECTION ACT AND SO- IT WOULD ACTUALLY. NOT BE ABLE TO BE REBUILT AS LARGE AS IT CURRENTLY IS. IF YOU GET LESS BUILDING FOR THE SAME. RIGHT YEAH I GUESS I GUESS MY CONCERN IS JUST RIGHT MY CONCERN IS ARE WE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE PLAGUED IT WOULD FALLING WINDOWS IN CLASS AND THAT KIND OF THING- THIS IS THE BUILDING CORRECT AND THAT AND THAT NO THE BUILDING WITH THE SCAFFOLDING THE WINDOWS IS A FOURTH IN ST ARMOR WE BUILT OUT THAT'S ACTUALLY FIRST IF THAT HELPS. WELL MAKE. I WAS JUST CONCERNED ABOUT IF THAT WAS THE ONE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TIME THANK YOU FOR THAT SURE SHE DID SAY THAT THIS IS NOT THE BUILDING OKAY SO IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS RECORD STAFF RECOMMENDATION AND THIS IS TO IMPROVE ITS BUDGET IT. ENTERTAIN THAT MOTION. MOTIONS BEEN MADE UP PLEASE KALRA CENTER CABRERA I CENTER NIELSEN. CENTER DRAWS A- MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN WHICH IS THE SECOND IN A REGION GREGORY BATESON BUILDING RENOVATION YES- VERY VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS AYE AYE I WON'T GO INTO MUCH DETAIL- I THINK- AGAIN FORCING CONDITIONS- FOR EXAMPLE NOT ONLY HAS THE EXTRA WATERPROOFING SYSTEM FOR THE BUILDING FAILED- THE RE DESIGN. THAT AND DESTRUCTION IT WERE THE B. TOOK IT APART AND SO THERE'S BEGIN THIS BUILDING IS THE SUBJECT- BUT WORSE CONDITION BEFORE MIGHTY SAME BIOENGINEERED. TEMP USE THE COSTS. WERE TOP IN THE NUMBER BEFORE YOU. HELLO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OF THE ONE ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE ON THIS OF. SEEING NONE IN THE. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO PROVE HIS BUDGET. I THINK VERY MEASURES THAT MOTION- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL CENTER CUT AREA HI CENTER NIELSEN SENATOR US BY. VERY GOOD PASSES UNANIMOUSLY ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION ELEVATOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND CENTERS- THE PARMESAN SERVICES REQUESTING FIFTY SIX POINT FOUR THREE MILLION AT ONE TIME GENERAL FUND- DOLLARS FOR HIGH PRIORITY ELEVATOR REPAIR PROJECTS- INCLUDE SEVENTEEN POINT NINE MILLION FOR. BUILDING TWENTY ONE- OVER TWENTY ONE MILLION FOR THE RONALD REAGAN BUILDING AND SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION PER ROUND AND GEORGE COMPLEX WHICH IS TWO TOWERS I JUST GET A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW IN HARRIS BUILDING WE HAVE SEVENTEEN L. CARS- THAT ARE ORIGINAL TO BUILDING CONSTRUCTION- IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN SO THERE TWENTY THREE YEARS- AND- CHALLENGES THERE ALSO. MANUFACTURE WITH ELEVATORS WAS SOLD IN TWO THOUSAND THREE YEAR TO INSTALL THEM TO FIND REPLACEMENT PARTS IS BECOMING YOUR POSSIBLE. RON REAGAN- BUILDING WE HAVE TWENTY ELEVATOR CARS THAT ARE ALL ORIGINAL TO THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE SO THEY'RE ALL THIRTY ONE YEARS OLD. ESSENTIALLY FULL TIME. AFTER THAT TO FIX MAINTAIN THIS POINT BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL AND KIND OF PARTS TO PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE THESE THINGS. ON A DAILY BASIS IS REQUIRING THAT. AND IN THE WRONG. BUILDING BUILDINGS EXCUSE ME IF YOU HAVE. SIXTEEN THE ONLY MODERNIZE LAST IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD. THERE ALSO SOME. FRIEDMAN BREAKDOWNS. PEOPLE SO WE POSIT TO YOU ALL FOR THESE PROJECTS ARE URGING NOT JUST FOR THE GO OF THE PUBLIC IN STATE EMPLOYEES IN THESE BUILDINGS- BUT TO MAINTAIN. THE SAFE BUILDINGS AS WELL. VERY GOOD OKAY THREE OF THREE ACCOMMODATIONS ON THIS ITEM AT FIRST IS- AND THIS REALLY APPLIES BOTH TO THIS ITEM AND THE NEXT I MISSPOKE COMMENTS ARE VERY SIMILAR BUT AND THE FIRST IS TO THE PROPHETIC FOR ALL THE MOST JOINT CRITICAL PROJECTS AND SO ON WE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS ON OF REAGAN PROJECT AS WELL AS A FIRE ON. ABOUT COMMITTING REJECTED RIGHT THE OTHER TWO ALRP. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THOSE MIGHT NOT BE WORTHWHILE PROJECTS ARE GOOD PROJECTS I THINK WE AND WE JUST SAYS- AND REALLY SORT OF AT THE PUMP THE DEPART. BE FINDING. PRIDE WHO. HIS PLEA RIDLEY ON THE BILL RATES DE CHARGE FOR TO ITS TENANTS ARE INTENDED TO RECOUP THE COSTS OF OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE BUILDINGS HASN'T ALWAYS WORKED OUT OF THE COULD AND FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE RECESSION- THAT UP. THERE WERE SOME BUT- THAT THE STATE WAS FACING AND SO ACCORDINGLY THE DEPARTMENT HELD ITS RATES VERY LOW FOR AND IT'S RENTAL RATES ON THAT THAT WAS ONE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO AT A SIGNIFICANT WELCOME TO. AND I'M SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT MEETING WITH THAT OF THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED SOME ONE TIME AND THE DEPARTMENT. I'M OUT OF THAT. DO YOU THINK THEN ON BASIS THAT WE SHOULD. BACK TO. A SITUATION WHERE. REALLY WE'RE COLLECTING SUFFICIENT FUNDS THROUGH THE RATE STRUCTURE TO MAINTAIN BUILDING ON GOING BASIS AND THE DEPARTMENTS PLANNING FOR THESE FUTURE NEEDS. SETTING ASIDE ANY AS- AS AS A SO WE THAT I'M THAT REALLY UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY URGENT- IT REALLY WE USE. THAT SORT OF RATE STRUCTURE TO DEFEND. I SECOND WE RECOMMEND. VISUAL AND TO LIMIT THE USE TO THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT ARE PRUDENT REASON FOR THAT IS THAT UNDER TO COST ESTIMATES THERE'S THAT ONE AND THE B. C. P. AND THAT FIFTY SIX MILLION FOR THESE LA. AT JACK'S. YEAH AND- ARE MEANT. I'M FEW YEARS AGO THAT ON THAT ON THAT WERE ESTIMATED TO BE ONLY THIRTEEN MILLION. SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE VARIETY OF REASONS FOR THAT BUT- WE THINK THERE'S SOME CHANCE THAT THESE PROJECTS COULD COME IN LOWER INTO THAT IT. IF THEY DO WE THINK THAT. IT SHOULD BE BACK TO THE- AND THEN THE THIRD IS THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT'S REPORT ON ITS LONG TERM PLANNING FOR MAINTAINING BUILDINGS THEY'VE- IDENTIFIED A VERY SUBSTANTIAL BACKLOG. OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- AND SO AGAIN WE DON'T THINK THAT. IT'S REALLY SUSTAINABLE THING FOR THE STATE EVERY YEAR WE DONE ANYTHING SINCE MAYBE TWO DOZEN FOURTEEN FIFTY. RECALLING CORRECTLY PROVIDED THESE ONE TIME DEFERRED INSIDE. WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE STATE TO DO AN ON GOING BASIS. TO WORK TO COME UP WITH A- SOLUTION. WE THINK. YOU KNOW IN IN YOUR- TRY TO. READ AND- THE DEPARTMENT FOR THESE JACKSON MAINTAIN THEIR AS IF LEVEL. AND I'M AT RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SERVICE. YEAH I'VE I THINK WILL POINT OUT- TWO MANY THINGS PERSONS THAT WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT ALL THESE PROJECTS TO BE COMPLETED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THE DESIGN WORK ON. IT THE FUND'S CURRENT BEAVER MAINTENANCE THAT SAID- IT'S THE- FOR THE DAY THE OPERATION THE BUILDINGS WERE NEVER INTENDED TO CAUSE MASS TO SCALE CHECK SUCH AS IS AND WE WERE TO BUILD INTO THE RATES. NOW TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. ANY ON THE DOLLAR TO COVER COST NOW WE WOULD BE SITTING ON A GREAT CASH THAT I'M NOT SURE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD APPRECIATE QUITE FRANKLY WITHOUT HAVING MUCH MORE ROBUST DISCUSSION ON FUNDING MECHANISMS POTS DREAMS SO. THESE PROJECTS NEST JERRY AND BECAUSE THEY'RE FAR EXCEEDS OUR TOTAL ANNUAL BUDGET FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FROM ENTIRE PORTFOLIO. OKAY THIS IS- AN OPEN THE ISSUE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IS THERE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO MAKE THE COMING ON THESE. ON THIS ISSUE SEEING NONE AT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE QUESTIONS SO CURRENTLY THE ELEVATORS ARE FUNCTIONING- NOT FUNCTIONING- AND EVERY CONCERN IS YOU PROBABLY DO ABOUT NOT HAVING FUNCTIONING ELEVATORS IN THE BUILDING. EARN THEIR IN VARIOUS STATES QUITE CANDIDLY AND I DO NOT HAVE IN FRONT OF ME THE EXACT NUMBERS OF WHAT'S HOW MANY ARE FUNCTIONING TODAY WHAT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS ONE GOES UP AND ONE GOES DOWN AND ALL FOUR OF THESE BILLS. WE HAVE RARE. EARLY FOLKS. ELEVATORS OR JUST NOT ENOUGH ELEVATORS TO SERVICE THE FOLKS COMING UP AND DOWN THE BUILDING SO IT IS A HUGE. SERVICE ISSUED TO BOTH. AND CANDIDLY. BOYS ROBERT WORKING THESE BUILDINGS AND- HAS BECOME A CHALLENGE AS WELL. BECAUSE CONCERT AND- I'M SURE YOU WILL GO FOR WITH THIS- WHAT IS THE TIME. SO THEY WOULD BE AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS ALL THREE OF THESE PROJECTS WE HAVE UNDER SIGN UP THE GOAL WOULD BE IF APPROVED BY BOTH LEGISLATION ON THE AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD START CONSTRUCTION ON ALL THREE OF THESE PROJECTS IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. WE WOULD BE IN CONSTRUCTION. THIS FISCAL IN WHICH THE DOLLARS WERE APPROPRIATE. SO MEANWHILE THEY'RE STILL MEANWHILE THE WORST WE'RE STILL WORKING THEIR DATA SERVICING THEM CORRECTLY. SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD OPEN THE SYSTEM RECOMMENDATIONS OR WILL DO THAT AND THAT TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AGAIN- ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN IT THE SAUDIS MANAGEMENT DIVISION FIRE ASSIST. ME IN ADDITION TO THE ELEVATOR MADE ITS BCP WE HAVE A SECOND PC PEACE DAY FOR YOU THE REQUEST TWENTY THREE POINT SIX MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND.

HELLO WE SPECIFIC ANSWER TO THE PROPOSAL THAT WE DO KNOW THAT THE ISSUES RAISED BY STAFF ARE CERTAINLY REASONABLE. IS THERE ANY MEMBER PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO REST THAT COMMITTEE ON THIS ISSUE. SEE AND A BRIEF BACK TO- THE COMMITTEE AND I A I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN MORE. STAFF IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE- SECOND. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE MAY NEED THIS THIS IS A HOLD OF OPEN ITEM BUT WE MAY NEED LANGUAGE THAT- AT AND MY EXPERIENCE. WITH GO COUNTY JAILS IN PARTICULAR IS THAT. THERE ARE VERY FEW MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE- AND- THE ABILITY TO OVER MEDICATE IS. VERY AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT A POPULATION THAT YOU WANT TO CONTROL AND THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS- AND- I'M WORRIES ME I THINK WE SAW WE'VE SEEN THAT IN YOUNG CHILDREN AS WELL AS THEY HAVE THE DRUGS IN USED. PROBABLY ARE USED YOUNG KIDS IS A WAIT THERE AND- WHAT WHEN I WAS YOUNG WAS JUST SEEN AS HYPERACTIVE ACT ACT EXPECTED ACTIVITIES SO- I THIS LIKE I SAID THIS IS AT A HOLD OF OPEN ITEM BUT- TO. SAY THAT I'M CONCERNED. TERMS OF. THE AXE. SO IT MAY BE ONE ANSWER ASK AND ANSWER THAT IT'S I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I JUST RAISING IT IS AN ISSUE. I CAN'T WRITE A LITTLE BIT TIONAL A INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE- THE STATE COUNTY TASK FORCE THAT WOULD INCORPORATE THE POPULATIONS GOALS RIGHT PART OF EFFORTS- THAT WERE IN A FIGHT IN A WORKING THROUGH THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ACTIVITIES. WHAT'S THE NEED TO HAVE BEEN CREATION WITH LOCAL JAILS BETWEEN. OF THE STATE. ELITE THE STATE SPITTLE. THE LOCAL CHAIR IN IN WHICH THERE IN WHERE YOU HAVE THE SAME. PATIENTS GOING THROUGH ALL OF THOSE FACILITIES- SO PART OF THAT- WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN THAT FAR INTO- THE CONCEPT OF WHICH SPECIFIC DRUGS- AND WHAT ARE THE MAIN ISSUES WE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH. HOW FORCE THAT INCLUDES- SOME OF THE JAILS TO KIND OF IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE DATA TO D. G. S. ON WHAT THEIR OPERATIONS ARE WHAT DRUGS THEY SEE AS MAYBE A BENEFIT THE DG ASK A CONTRACT ON BEHALF. I'M QUITE. FAR INTO THE ADA VERY GOOD IT I JUST KNOW THAT- THAT EVEN WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE. TAKEN INTO THE JAIL. PRESCRIPTION THE COUNTY JAILS WILL NOT KILL IT UNLESS THEY HAVE A DOCTOR THAT'S GOING TO CONFIRM THAT THAT PRESCRIPTION SHOULD FOLLOW THE INDIVIDUAL AND SO I'D BE TO TEND TO GIVE THE CITY THE COUNTY HAS TO DECIDE IT IS IT'S GOING. THE STATION WITH THEIR BE AT. HE N. DONE BY A DOCTOR THAT'S QUALIFIED TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THAT PARTICULAR MEDICATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO IN. I APPRECIATE THAT NECESSITY OF FOLLOWING HAVING THAT DRUG FOLLOW BECAUSE SOME OF THE PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS ARE ON. IT IS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES IF YOU TAKE THEM OFF WITHOUT ANY- WEANING OR WORK OUT THE APPROPRIATE- REDUCTION IN A PRESCRIPTION SO I AM JUST CONCERNED THAT WE BE COGNIZANT OF THAT IN AND HAVE SOME GOOD PARAMETERS AROUND. THE CITY TO BE ABLE TO GET- THE MEDICATION TO THAT END SO THAT'S JUST MY CONCERN. SO MAYBE MAYBE THAT THAT A FOLLOW UP TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME. SO THIS IS THE HOLDER OVER ITEM YES S. CENTER DRAWS A- MANAGER I Q. KERR I AM CONCERNED ABOUT US MAYBE BE IN THE POSITION. BLAME A GREATER USE ARE HOT. OF THIS KIND OF MEDICATION AS ONE EXAMPLE THAT THAT YOU GAVE SO UP I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS OF THE JAIL TASK FORCE AND- YOU KNOW. IT'S PURPOSES GOALS AND HOW IT'S FUNCTIONING THERE IS AN ISSUE HERE- IF THERE'S A BUDGET ISSUE AND THEN THERE'S A POLICY ISSUE OF THE USE OF THE DRUG. BUT THEY SEEM TO BE FULLY. SO HOW DO WE GET TO THE TO THE BOTTOM OF HOW DO WE GET THE ANSWERS. ABOUT OUR CONCERNS OF THIS TASK FORCE HAS BEEN SET UP SO DTS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PURCHASING END OF IT ONLY WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLICY PIECE I'M AND SO IN. IN THAT WE WILL ENGAGE. PRACTITIONER THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS SPECIFIC TO THE DRUGS THAT ARE PURCHASED- WE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND HAVE A FORMULA COMMITTEE. AT A FOR THE STATE BUYS THAT WE MAKE THAT INCORPORATES PRACTITIONERS PHARMACISTS- OTHERS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING WHAT THE DRUGS DO WHAT THE EFFICACY OF THE DRUGS ARE ALL OF THOSE IT. IS THAT ARE RELATED TO SOME OF YOUR POLICY CONCERNED YES TO. THE DISTANCE MAKE THE DECISIONS ON ON TO THE DROP THAT THE PARK. HAVE DETERMINED ARE THE- UGGS TGS GO PROJECT IS THE OF THE STATE. T. WE WERE ENVISION AGAIN THAT THE TASK FORCE HAS GOTTEN OFF THE GROUND YET BUT WE WOULD ENVISION A VERY SIMILAR STRUCTURE TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN WHICH TGS NOT MAKING THOSE POLICY DECISIONS ON. OUR DRUGS ARE APPROPRIATE IN THESE INSTANCES WELL THAT'S EXACTLY MY CONCERN- IS THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE- SILO. YOU KNOW THE ISSUES TO BE SILOS THAT THIS IS WE'RE JUST GOING TO. BE THAT WE'RE WE'RE THE ONES IN CHARGE OF BUYING. THE DRUGS THAT WE WANT NOBLE GRADE WE YOU KNOW WHAT IS A GOOD PLACE FOR YOU TO BE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. POSITION OF- APPROVING THIS UP. WITHOUT BENEFIT. SEE DISCUSS SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW AND WHERE DO WE HAVE THAT POLICY DISCUSSION WHICH IS VERY MUCH CONNECTED TO OUR A BUDGET ISSUE. I DON'T KNOW WHO CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AND WE MEAN WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TODAY BUT WHAT I THINK- AND CERTAINLY ASSIST YOU JUST WANNA BE CAREFUL THIS NOT STEP OUT OF OUR POLICY AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT BIG WEEK FOR CERTAINLY FOLLOWING UP WITH. ME DEFINITION TO DISCUSS THE AND HELP FIGURE CAN ABOUT THE NEXT OF I THINK THAT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THIS THIS MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD GO EITHER. YOUR THROUGHOUT. HEALTH TERM OF AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT KIND OF. WHAT WHAT ELSE WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT- OUR CONCERNS THE POLICY CONCERNS WE HAVE ARE TAKEN CARE OF SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I. WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS ONE. THIS ITEM OPEN AND WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF REVISIT THE DISCUSSION MOVING ON TO THE SECRETARY GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY IN AND OUT ALL YOUR WORK. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN WHICH IS THE WORKLOAD ADJUSTMENT AND POSITION TRANSPARENCY. WELCOME THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME'S JUSTIN OUR DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR FISCAL POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND OPERATIONS YOU CAN SEE WITH ME IS THE STATE'S CHIEF DATA OFFICER TôI BONE GROWTH THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS ONE RELATED WORKLOAD WITHIN THE A- AND C. AS WELL. SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE ARE REQUESTING IS THREE NEW POSITIONS INCLUDING ASSOCIATED COSTS AS WELL AS ANY ASSOCIATED INCREMENTAL COSTS FOR THE RE CLASSIFICATION OF TO EXISTING POSITIONS ALONG WITH AN ADJUSTMENT FOR LEASE COSTS RELATED TO OUR AGENCIES- PENDING MOVEMENT OUT OF THE BUILDING- AS IT IS GETTING PREPARE. D. G. S. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL WAS TO BE TRANSPARENT WITH HOW THINGS HAVE BEEN OPERATING WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY OVER THE TIME AGENCY IS. PARTICULARLY BEEN BORROWING POSITIONS FROM POSITION OF FROM OUR DEPARTMENT THAT REQUIRE TRUST AND WE WANTED TO CLEAN UP THAT PRACTICE IN ORDER TO GET EVERYTHING ON TO OUR BOOKS SO THAT YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE TRUTH RATING COST ABOUT AGENCY YES. THE WAY WE CAN STOP BACK TO SERVE. EIGHT POSITIONS FROM OUR DEPARTMENTS IN THAT THEY CAN RETURN TO THEIR DEPARTMENT AND PERFORM THE WORK THAT THEY ARE REALLY HARD TO DO AT THOSE LOW. SELF WITH. MEDIUM REQUIRE. CAN CONCERNS. OKAY IS THERE ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC THAT WANT TO READ THE COMMITTEE. SAYING NONE QUESTION FOR THE COMMITTEE. SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS- ITEM IT MAY BE A- POLICY ISSUE HERE ABOUT THE DATA SHARING AND WHAT'S VOLUNTARY. AND WHAT'S NOT AND MAYBE WE CAN SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT ALL THAT JOY ARE THE STATE'S SHIFT OUT OF OFFICER WHO JUST RECENTLY STARTED HERE AT THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DATA SHARE AND- AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- MAY BE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DATA HOW THAT KIND AND PLEASE HEAR. OKAY ON THE DATA SHARING- ADDRESSING IT ESSENTIALLY IT ADMINISTRATIVE STREAMLINED STRATEGY SO RIGHT NOW- UNDER OF AGENCIES FACE A SUITE OF PRIVACY REGULATIONS ON WHICH DICTATE ALLOWABLE USE INCLUDE WHAT'S ALLOWED FOR DATA SHARING- BUT TO THE EIGHT IS HAVE. AND GREEN. AND IT TO BE IN A CO. THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATOR STREAM MOVE TO A SINGLE FRAMEWORK TO OPERATE UNDER THE EXISTING ROBUST SET OF PRIVACY REGULATIONS THAT AGENCIES WORK BUT TO STREAMLINE THE NEGOTIATIONS IF YOU WILL HOW TO DO THAT. FAIR TO SAY THAT IT IT IT IT'S IT CREE TO ONE CONTRACT FOR HOW THAT DATA CAN BE SHARED AS OPPOSED TO EVERYONE NEGOTIATING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT SO IT CREATES A SAME BASELINE OF DATA PROTECTION AND STANDARDS AND- CREATES A SINGLE PLACE WHERE WE GET TO RECORD AND DOCUMENT IN MONITOR THAT. RIGHT EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE. SURE SO- TO RIGHT NOW- STATE AGENCIES FACE A ROBUST SET OF PRIVACY REGULATIONS SO EVERYTHING FROM YOU KNOW THE STATE INFORMATIONS ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO- A WHOLE BUNCH OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS WHETHER IT'S FOR BY HIPAA WE HAVE MANY STATE EQUIVALENTS THERE'S AT YOU I'M SURE YOU'RE OFF YOUR WITH A WHOLE. LIST OF THEM THOSE ARE OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR LAW FOR WHEN WE HAVE ALLOWABLE SHARING ACROSS AGENCIES IN SO INCLUDING TO IMPROVE SERVICES FOR THE RECIPIENTS GRAHAM SO FOR EXAMPLE MANY STATING THERE SERVING THE SAME APPLE RELATIONS YOU WANT TO BE ABLE IN HOLISTIC CARE. ON AS I HAS A CLEANING GOES THOSE OF AGREEMENTS COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING THIS CREATES A SINGLE FRAMEWORK FOR. I'M A SINGLE COME CARP CONTRACTUAL FRAMEWORK THAT ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES THE ROBUST DATA PROTECTION AND CONFORM TO ALL THE EXISTING LAWS WHILE HAVING A SINGLE AGREEMENT AND THEN IN EACH INSTANCE OF DATA SHARING THEREFORE THEY HAVE WE HAVE TO DOCUMENT ON WHAT'S CALLED THE BUSINESS USE CASE PROPOSAL APPLE. THEN TRACK THOSE IN TRACK CONTRACT COMPLIANCE WITH DOES THAT HELP EXPLAIN. THE PERSON WHOSE INFORMATION IS BEING SHARED FROM AGENCY TO AGENCY DO THEY KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN DONE SO HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT SURE ALL AGENCIES FACE- WATER CALL NOTICE REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO GIVE EITHER IN THEIR ARMS ARE ON THEIR SITE SAYING WATER THE USES OF IT AND COVERED BY THAT TYPE OF AND IN THOSE ARE TYPICALLY FLOWING ALREADY FROM THE EXISTING PRIVACY REGULATION. I MEAN. SEVEN GET ODOR SO THAT OR IS THAT JUST THE AGENCY. ST THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE JUST AT THE PERSON ACTUALLY KNOW THAT THEIR INFORMATION IS BEING SHARED FROM AGENCY TO AGENCY SO THOSE NOTICES ARE INCLUDED WHETHER YOU SIGN A FORM OR ON YOUR WEB SITE OR FOR A ON AGENCY WEB. SAMPLE THESE ARE THE ALLOW USES THAT EXTENT IF WE- AND ON. PERMISSIBLE THOSE LWS. THOSE RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU WANT TO PROVIDE THIS TO SOMEONE. THIS IS NECESSARY IN ORDER PROVIDE THAT SERVICE THAT CONCEPT OF ALLOWABLE USE. SO THIS IS DEFINITELY IN THE IN THE LITTLE BIT.

EARLY TECH. YEAH I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GREAT POLICY DISCUSSION TO HAVE IT'S A VERY INTERESTING TOPIC AND- YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE REQUEST THAT'S HERE BEFORE YOU WHICH IS REALLY JUST SOME WORKLOAD TRANSPARENCIES IT SUGGESTS MANY THINGS THAT WILL BE WORKING IN OUR AGENCY- BUT WE'RE NOT ACCESSING FOR YOU KNOW. RESOURCES RELATED REMAINS JUSTIN ELLIS. AMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS POSITION WILL BE WORKING. ON SO. WHAT I UNDERSTAND WE'RE SENATOR EYES SO IT'S COMING FROM MY THAT THAT. THE STATE DOESN'T TAKE PERSONAL PEOPLE'S PERSONAL INFORMATION AND SELL IT FOR ANY PURPOSE. ASCERTAIN THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR OTHER KINDS OF SERVICES OR MEANT PARTICULAR IN THAT SOCIAL SERVICE AREA. ALL WITHIN THE SAME DEPARTMENT BUT DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE ORGANIZATION SEE THAT. WE'RE OKAY IT'S- BEEN A MESS ON THE TABLE MANY CASE AND WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION PROBABLY IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC AND WE COULD COME AROUND AND I'M YOU KNOW.

YOU WHICH IS SIX AND DISASTER PREPAREDNESS. WHAT. VERY VERY WE'RE DOING VERY WELL. OTHER THAN THAT SPELLED MAYES BUILT WATER. I WAS SITTING ON MY HANDS WELCOME. OKAY. THANK YOU MATT. THE USER MIKE AS WELL AS MY TEACHER FOUR AM. I MAN DOWN CRAWFORD THE DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. THESE ARM BY STAFF MEMBERS DEPUTY DIRECTOR AYE ANNIKA BREWERY. AND KRISTIN MARVELOUS ARE AT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS. OUT FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THAT I'M REALLY PROUD THAT- THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IS A STATE AGENCY THAT'S KNOWN FOR THE BEST RESPECT RESPONSIVENESS IN EQUITY THAT WE HAVE WITH ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY. IN THESE ITEMS A LOT TO DO WITH THAT. NOW BEFORE WE BEGIN THOUGH I LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'RE SITTING HERE BEFORE YOU THE MORNING AFTER THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT AM. REGARDING THE COVE IN NINETEEN POLICY ON MASS GATHERINGS GREATLY IMPACTS INTO OUR WORK AND OUR WHOLE FIELD THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WILL. HIT ANYBODY WHO HAS A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE ADVANCE AT BASICALLY THE CORE OF MANY MANY OF THE ARTS BUSINESS GOALS THAT OUT WE- AARON SERVICE SERVE AND THEIR LIFELINE FOR INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS AS WELL THE IMPACT IS LIKELY TO BE THE GREATEST FOR THE UNDER RESOURCE. IN THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WE ARE SURVEYING THE FIELD TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATION OF THIS CRISIS AND CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT ON OUR GRANTEES AS WELL AS ON THE ARTS LANDSCAPE OVERALL. BUT JUST ABOUT THE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THEIR STATE FUNDED ADVANCE. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL IF TEN POINT FIVE MILLION OF ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INTO OUR BUDGET THESE FUNDS ARE TO BE ALLOCATED IT THREE DIFFERENT WAYS. AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT WAYS BUT THEY ALL CONNECT WHICH IS THE BEAUTY OF OUR WORK IS INCREASINGLY SO ALL OF OUR WORK IS INTERSECTIONAL. NINE MILLION DOLLARS IS TO EXPAND THE CULTURAL DISTRICT PROGRAM AND SUPPORT OUR FOURTEEN. PILOT COHORT OF CULTURAL DISTRICTS. FOURTEEN DISTRICTS THAT CURRENTLY HOLD THE STATE DESIGNATION REPRESENT CALIFORNIA THROUGH A VARIETY OF LENSES GEOGRAPHICALLY CULTURALLY AND ARTISTICALLY. THE INTENT OF CALIFORNIA CULTURAL DISTRICTS PROGRAM IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE CULTURAL LEGACY FOR STATES MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE. IT'S DIVERSITY. THE PROGRAM INSPIRES TO ASSIST CALIFORNIANS IN LEVERAGING THE STATE'S CONSIDERABLE ASSETS IN THE IT IS OF WILSHIRE. CREATIVITY AND DIVERSITY AS A NATIONALLY SET OUT IN THE ENABLING JUST LATE IN EIGHT. WHY EIGHT NINE MR DEALING WITH FOUR DIGITS HERE. HAVE ONE EIGHTY NINE THE INITIAL COURT IS A ROBUST FOUNDATION FOR WHAT OF FUNDED CULTURAL DISTRICT PROGRAM CAN BE SO WE'RE BUILDING ON SOMETHING THAT. THAT WE FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT- BEING SUCCESSFUL. IT CAN BE THE INTERSECTION OF MUCH OF OUR WORK INCLUDING ARTISTS KEEPING ARTIST PLACE. THROUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AFFORDABLE WORKSPACE AN ECONOMY WITH INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY SEAT SITTING AT ITS CENTER HEALTH AND WELL BEING EVERYTHING THAT CREATES OMMUNITY RESILIENCY. I AM GOING TO EXPLAIN WHERE THE ONE MILLION WOULD GO UP TO TEN POINT FIVE THE ONE MILLION IS TO DEVELOP DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ARTS COUNCIL'S BEEN INVOLVED IN. QUITE A LONG TIME- AND REALLY SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN WE'VE BEEN GETTING REGULAR UPDATES ON OUR WEBSITE AT I'M PUTTING TOOLS AND RESOURCES OUT THERE TO OUR FIELD- BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY REAP IF WE PUT TOGETHER. AND ENGAGE NINETEEN. AND SO THE GOAL OF THIS ONE MILLION IS TWO X. ON THAT WORK SO IT'S TO DEVELOP DISASTER PREPAREDNESS GUIDELINES AND BEST PRACTICES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE RESOURCES AND ART AND- THAT LANGUAGE YEAH I KNOW- IT IS OUT THERE IN IN THE BUDGET LANGUAGE BUT WE LIKE TO ADD THE IDEA THAT ALSO. PROTECT HAVE WORK DO YOU SPACE DOCK. COST AND OTHER PROPERTY INSTRUMENTS FOR TOOLS. USED BY ARTISTS AND ARTS ORGANIZATIONS THAT COULD BE IMPACTED BY ANY KIND OF DESIGN. AND BECAUSE AS WE KNOW IT IT'S NOT JUST ARTIFACTS- SO THIS AS I SAID WE'RE GOING TO BUILD ON THIS WILL BUILD UP I SEE A SEIZE WORK THAT WE- DIDN'T IN NINETEEN WE LOCK. A SPECIAL GIFT- AND THAT SUPPORT IN NINETEEN. US STATE LOCAL PARTNERS THAT I MENTIONED- AND IT SUPPORTED THEIR COMPACT UNIT ABILITY OF THESE ARTS AND CULTURAL IS ATION PARTICIPATE COMMUNITIES AT LARGE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES. THAT MAY AFFECT THEIR COMMUNITIES. IT OFF TRAINING WORKSHOP STATE WIDE YARD A LOCAL. THERE AS A CAP. DOES BY THE COUNTY SUPERVISOR. IN ORDER TO BUILD LOCAL AND CAPACITY AND ALSO TO FOSTER DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTY WIDE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS NETWORKS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF RESOURCES DURING THIS DISASTER SO- AS I SAID THOSE WERE NINETEEN OF THEM AND SO OF COURSE THERE ARE MORE BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW MANY COUNTIES THERE ARE- AND WE ARE WE CURRENTLY HAVE PARTNERS IN ABOUT FIFTY THREE FIFTY FOUR OF THEM. CURRENTLY AND SO- THE I IS THAT THESE FUNDS WOULD BE USED TO- SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS THAT WE THE NINETEEN RECEIVED AND IN ADDITION. REACH OUT TO THE OTHER. STATE OF. I DID NOT OFTEN FOR. NEW WALK TO. STILL FOR A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THE PROPOSED TO SUPPORT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES. SEATED WITH THE ABOVE ACTIVITIES AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY- AND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EQUITY BECAUSE THAT'S COME IN SOME OF THE DISCUSSION NO THAT TURNED ON THE COUNCIL AWFUL UTILIZE OUR NEWLY IMPLEMENTED TO TEACH IT FRAMEWORK THAT RE OF. A ROW STRENGTHENING FEET OF ARTS AND CULTURE AND TO CHAMPION THE ARTS AS ESSENTIAL NOT OPTIONAL. IN ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES FACING OUR COMMUNITIES TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE. AS PART OF THIS HAS COME FROM OUR PARTICIPATION GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE AND REYES EQUITY THAT HAS THAT HAS BEEN. GOING HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCILS PARTICIPATED IN THE CAPITAL CALL FOR IT WITH. THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S AROUND ISSUES- WE'RE COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING AN ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE THAT ACTIVELY ADDRESSES BARRIERS. DISSIPATION FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND CELEBRATES THE CONNECT WITH AN INSECT. WELL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. SO THIS FRAMEWORK THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED INCLUDES MANY TOOLS THAT WILL HELP US WALK THROUGH THE DESIGN. PROCESS HOW WE'RE GOING TO. ALLOW THIS SIX DAY. SIXTH GRAND. WE THAT AS A TOOL WE USE THE DAY THAT WE LEARNED FROM MARVIN. OF TO A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AND ENSURE. THAT THE BULLY ROLLED OUT OF TOTAL TO SIX PROGRAM I'M REPRESENTS THE STATE BOTH GRAPHICALLY AND RACIALLY- AND THAT WE RETAIN HOME GROWN ART AND CULTURAL ASSETS. THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THAT WE MEDICAID DISPLACEMENT FOR GROUPS SUCH AS ARTISTS. LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND ARTS ORGANIZATIONS. GOOD HELLO HI SO WE KNOW THAT IN GENERAL WE THINK THEY'RE PRICED APPEARS REASONABLE IF IT'S CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES- BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT-WHEN IT WE THINK ONE OF THE GREAT VALUES OF POTENTIALLY EXPANDING THIS BOTH PROGRAMS OF THE MAIN PROGRAMS AT THE OPPOSING FINE THEY'VE MALL SCALE THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. TO GIVE THE A MORE YEARS THE HOW THEY- OPERATE AB. THE STATE MAKES A- OF WHETHER. TO INVEST IN THESE AS ACTIVITIES ON A LONG TERM MAYBE ONGOING BASIS I'M SWEEPING THAT'S A REASONABLE APPROACH BUT WE THINK IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE HAS. INFORMATION AT THE END OF THE YEAR TWO OR THREE YEARS- PERIOD WHERE THIS THESE NEW PILOTS ARE. ARE OCCURRING. IN TO HAVE. GOALS FOR THEM AS WELL AS MEASURABLE OUTCOMES. PART OF RECOMMENDATIONS ARE TO OLD ONE AND I'M- WE THAT THE LEGISLATURE. ESTABLISH SPECIFIC GOALS FOR THE PROGRAM COULD CIVIC. BUT NOT GOAL. ONE OF THE KEY GOAL FOR THESE HAVE. AND IF IT'S MEANT. I'M OF THE INITIAL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE CONSULTANT OUT IS TODAY WAS THAT THAT WAS MY BEAST IN THE PROGRAM AND THEN TO- SECOND PART WE THINK THAT SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH TRIP BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION AND ALSO WITH BUDGET TRAILER LODGE SHOULD WE THINK THAT THAT ALSO SHOULD BE TO AND THE VALUE. REALLY FROM THOSE. THAT WE THINK THAT'LL JUST AND THAT THE STATE HAS A BETTER INFORMATION. I'M YOU KNOW IN TWO OR THREE YEARS WHEN WE MIGHT BE SITTING HERE AGAIN. HE ABOUT REMINDED DO THIS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THERE'S CERTAINLY PROMISED TO THESE PROGRAMS- BUT- THAT THE CHALLENGES IS MAKING SURE THAT WE- REALLY KNOW WHAT WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR THAT'S FINE. VERY GOOD- OR ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. HELLO CHECK A RESUME KISS ME TO MEMBERS MY NAME IS PETER COMISKEY AND I'M HERE TODAY TO REPRESENT ALL FOURTEEN OF THE PILOTS CULTURAL DISTRICTS AND WE ARE MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA CULTURAL DISTRICT COALITION. WHILE THE NUMBER OF THE CULTURE DISTRICTS WISH THEY COULD HAVE BEEN AND TEN THE STAMP CHOI UNDERSTAND THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FIRST I FULLY SUPPORT THE FULL TEN MILLION- I'M JUST HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE NINE- AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF. SUPPORT YOUR- YOUR AGENCY- THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IS BRICK ENGAGE WITH COMMUNITY- AND SUPPORTIVE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER EXCELLENT. FIRST THING STOP BEING SUCH A COMPANY REVIEW. OF THE PILOT CULTURAL DISTRICT PROGRAM AND YOUR MEETING MATERIALS IT'S EXCITING THIS NEW AND SUCCESSFUL TOOL HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE TOKEN. IS WITH GREATEST RISK THAT I WAS TO PROVIDE CLARIFICATION ON BECAUSE SOME COMMENTS THAT WERE PROVIDED I WELCOME YOU ARE EATING TO ENGAGE WITH ME OR ANY OF THE PUBLIC COACHES DISTRICTS BUT EXAMPLES EVIDENCE AN OUTLAW POTENTIAL OF EXCEPTIONAL IMPACT PROGRAM. WELL IT DOT CULTURAL DISTRICTS WAS CHOSEN JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. TO PROVIDE A RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS FOR THE FIRST CO QUOTE. SOME ESTABLISHED AREAS. SOME RURAL SOME OPEN. WITH SUCH A SHORT TIME FRAME IN WHICH TO BRING A PROGRAM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. I CONSIDER RIGHT SUCCESS THAT PERCENT ARE ALREADY REPORTING ECONOMIC IN. IT IS SOMETIMES YOU NOT GET THAT ACHIEVEMENT IN PLACE. GENTRIFICATION WAS ALSO RISE WHEN I COMMITTED OFTEN CITED BASED UPON THE OLD MODEL OF REDEVELOPMENT WHERE CITY MIGHT TEAR DOWN I SHOULD CITY COAL AND BUILD A MASSIVE PERFORMING ARTS CENTER IN ITS PLACE. WELL SUCH ASSETS IS STILL VERY IMPORTANT AT COMMUNITIES THIS IS NOT THE CULTURAL DISTRICT PROGRAM WHAT IT ADVOCATES FOR DELIVERANCE. INDEED THE PROGRAM IN THE FANTASTIC DESIGNED BY THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL SERVES TO DRIVE COLLABORATION. BY EXISTING CULTURAL ASSETS TREATY TO PROTECT CELEBRATE AND EXCITE. YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK AT EUREKA. TRUCKEE ALL LITTLE TOKYO AS STELLA EXAMPLES. THESE CULTURAL DISTRICT UP PROTECTING THE ARTS AND CULTURE COMMUNITIES FOSTERING THEM. GROWING CELEBRATING THE- I ALSO CARRIAGE IN MEASURING THE IMPACT OF CULTURAL DISTRICT BY THE ZIP CODE ANALYSIS THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN YOUR PACKET. FIRST THESE CULTURAL DISTRICT ARE IMPACTING CITIES AND REGIONS NOT INDIVIDUALS OF CODES. ALSO COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE I BEING IMPACTED BY INCREASING DEVELOP RISING HOW COSTS AND ACCESS ISSUES IN MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND I WOULD USE COLOR QUITE TWENTY FOUR AT IN SAN FRANCISCO BARRIO LOGAN IS EXAMPLES. THE UP. WOULD SHOW WAS. HOWEVER THE CULTURAL DISTRICT IS WORKING TO PROTECT THE EXISTING COMMUNITIES EXISTING CULTURAL ELEMENTS WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES FINALLY I WOULD LEAVE YOU WITH ONE THOUGHT THE CULTURAL DISTRICTS PROGRAM IS AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE AN UNPARALLELED FORCE MULTIPLIER. CULTURAL DISTRICTS OF PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS ARTS AND CULTURE NEIGHBORHOOD AND BUSINESS IT IS A LEVERAGING TOOL NOT JUST FOR THE DIRECT PARTNERS IN THE PROGRAM. BUT ALSO THE COMMUNITY IN GENERAL FOR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO RECEIVE FUNDING. WHAT IS MISSING IS THE FUNDING NECESSARY FOR THESE BUSY INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATIONS TO WORK TOGETHER. TO DELIVER THEIR PROGRAM ALONE IS SUCCESSFUL TO LIVE IN THESE PROGRAMS TOGETHER IS EXCEPTIONAL. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL AREAS WHERE THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FUNDS INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATIONS WILL LEAD TO A MANY FOLD INCREASE IN COLLABORATION EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICACY FOR ALL. OF YOUR FUNDED PROGRAMS IN THE REGION. THIS FUNDING WILL DELIVER A RESOLVES TO FOCUS ON COLLABORATION A RESULTS TO FOCUS ON DELIVERING AND PROTECTING COMMUNITIES IN A HOLISTIC WAY. AND A FOCUS ON LEVERING LEVERAGING FUNDING. INCLUSION OF SIXTEEN YOU CULTURAL DISTRICTS IN THE PILOT PROGRAM ADDING TO THE FOURTEEN EXISTE. WILL BROADEN THAT SUCCESS ACROSS THE STATE. I AM TOTALLY A CULTURAL DISTRICT CONVERT. AND I ASK THAT FUNDING BE APPROVED SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO LEAVE THE AUTUMN OPEN ALL FOURTEEN OF THE EXISTING CULTURAL DISTRICTS LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INSIGHT SHOULD THAT FULL TO YOURSELVES WE'LL STOP. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THE RECOMMENDATION TODAY IS TO HOLD IT OPEN I GUESS I AM. I HAVE A QUESTION TO START WITH IS THAT- THE INTENTION IS TO IDENTIFY A SIXTEEN NEW- LOCATIONS. AND IN TERMS OF THE LOCATIONS THAT YOU CHOSE AND VERY INTERESTING AND YOU KNOW I LOVE THE ART TO ME TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT AND- I IT'S THE REASON I SUPPORTED THIS IN- OUT LAST YEAR'S BUT- BUT- BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE IS- AND MY CONCERN IS I LOOK AT THE- LOCATIONS THAT WERE CHOSEN. THERE A HIGHLY CONCENTRATED IN CERTAIN AREAS AND THERE THERE'S THERE I MADE MY ISSUE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE RURAL AND IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE LOW INCOME SO- WHEN I LOOK AT THAT THERE'S A WHOLE AREA OF THE STATE WHICH IS HUGE THAT HAS. DOES IT HAVE. AB EIGHT OF A GRANT INTO I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. HOW HOW HOW YOU CHOSE THESE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR. AND THEN HOW YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE YOUR DECISIONS FOR OUR- FOR THE FUTURE. AND ALSO THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED ON BY THE LA OWES OFFICE IN TERMS OF. MEASURABLE OUTCOMES SPECIFIC GOALS AND THE- AND I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE ABILITY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS TO LEVERAGE PRIVATE FUNDS AS WELL. RIGHT OUT I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE. HAVE ANSWERS. THERE IS A LOCAL INCHING TO THE EDGE OF THEIR STATE SENATE I'D IT JUST. BEFORE I. KIND OF. OUT OUT RELY TOO LATE THAT WE HAVE. I'M AND MATH WITH. THAT LINK TO EVERY COUPLE DISTRICT. AND OUT. A LOT OF SUPPORTING MATERIALS. WE'RE WE'LL SEND BETTY ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS EIGHT HAVE THEIR OWN WILLING TO SUPPLY ANSWERS TO SAY THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT. THERE'S A LOT OF BACKGROUND TO THIS AND BECAUSE IT EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN RAISED HERE IS A CONCERN OF OUR COUNCIL. AND WE'VE BEEN IN CONSTANT CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AND I AM GOING TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE- I'M STILL THE NEWBIE. I AM NOT QUITE A SHINY AS I WAS LAST TIME I SAW YOU ALL THAT AND STILL LOW SHINY SO THIS WAS IMPLEMENTED BEFORE I CAME. M. AND THESE WOMEN ACTUALLY HAD BOOTS ON THE GROUND DOING SITE VISITATIONS AND STARTING THAT COVERED UP. COMES CONVENTION. SO IN REFERENCE TO WHAT- YOUR CONCERNS WELL THE COMMENTS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM LA WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT OPTION TO LOOK FOR OUTCOMES AND DEFINE THOSE BEFORE WE ROLL OUT THIS NEW COHORT OF CULTURE DISTRICTS AND WE CAN DO THAT NOW WE ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME. OKAY FUNDS ARE EIGHT FULL EVA IN LONGITUDINAL EVALUATION OF ALL OF OUR GRANT PROGRAMMING SO WE WILL HAVE THOSE RESEARCHERS ON BOARD THE R. F. P. IS. CAN OUT TO IT IS THAT WE ARE READY TO WORK WITH THOSE EVALUATORS SO THERE WE HAVE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THAT- I ALSO WE ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED IN THE COUNCIL AS I SAID EARLIER IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE- ARE. WE ARE THOSE LAWS I'M COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES PART WITH. OUR STRATEGIC FRAME THE COUNCIL JUST TO PROVE IT IS A DECISION SUPPORT TOOL THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE QUESTIONS OF WHO ARE WE SERVING. WHO ARE WE REACHING WHERE ARE THE WE HAVE A STAT AWHILE WE HAVE BEEN CALLED TO THIS. PLEASE AWARE HAVE BEEN HUNDRED SEAT. I MEAN. AND THEN AND REFERENCE TO PRIVATE- LEVERAGING FRY PRIVATE FUNDS PART OF THE- A MODEL OF THE COUPLE DISTRICTS IS THAT IT WOULD BE AN ARTS ORGANIZATION COLLABORATING WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT RATING WITH LOCAL BUSINESSES AND SO THERE WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE COURT OF JUSTICE AS WE DEVELOP THEIR CAPACITY. TO LOOK AT OTHER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND PRIVATE THING AS WELL SO AND GAZED WITH THAT IN THAT SPOT FOR- DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROGRAM BUT WE'RE NOT DONE WITH THE BLIND SO INPUT IS REALLY IMPORTANT OUR COUNCIL IS LOOKING AT MAKING SURE THAT WE DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO REVIVE HIS GUIDE AND SO WE FOR. THE COMMUNITY AND MAKES. YOUR GRAPH THAT IS NOT WASTE THE AND SECTION SO IT IS PART OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO IN THE THAT TIME TO BE OF IT AS WE DO WITH OUR PROGRAM PROGRAM THEN IN RECENT SET I WAS APPOINTED IS BECAUSE I AM A RURAL ADVOCATE RIGHT I ALWAYS HAVE DON AND- KNOW THAT- SAY TO MUCH. AT JACK BATTERS. AND IT MATTERS VERY TO THE COUNTS. L. AND THAT WILL THEN IT ITS GEOGRAPHY AND THEN ALSO- DIFFERENT ART FORMS DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES AND I WAS REALLY HAPPY THAT THE- CALIFORNIA- STATE FAIR- HAS DESIGNED- MY DAD SHE PROGRAM FOR YOUNG STUDENTS TO COME IN TWO. DATE COMPETE AND THERE'S NOTHING GREATER THAN HAVING STUDENTS- LEARN A SKILL THAT IS HAS BEEN IN THEIR FAMILY FOR. YOU KNOW EVER AND TO SEE HOW PROUD THE FAMILIES ARE ABOUT THAT IN IT IT'S A COMMITMENT THAT LEARNING AND EXCELLENCE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT'S WHY WE'RE SO EXCITED TO HAVE THAT SEE IF FUNDED PROGRAM BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THEIR OTHER PARTS OF OUR WORK SO DEEP. CHEN EXACT YOUR TIME ABOUT WE CAN. A SEAT IS THAT. AS A REAL INTERSECTION POINT WE CAN A LOT OF OUR WERE. TOGETHER AND I WANTED TO ADD THAT I DIDN'T- SENT EMAIL TO YOUR STAFF TALKING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT FRAMEWORK AND HOW THAT THAT BREAKS OUT- AND HOW THAT REALLY DOES LOOK AT HOW WE OUT REACHED UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- IN ADDITION I SHARED WITH THEM SOME PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE RIGHT ALREADY DO FUND- OUTSIDE. STICKS THAT SPACE WE TARGET DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT YOU MENTIONED TODAY AND ALSO JUST MORE SPECIFICALLY GETTING TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW WE WILL REACH OUT AS AN HONEST SAID WITH CULTURE DISTRICTS WE HAVEN'T YET DEVELOPED. AND LINES AND SO WE WILL DEFINITELY BE CHANGING HOW WE OUT REACH BASED ON THE RESULTS WE HAVE FROM EVALUATION ALL WE PLAN I'M- TOGETHER. A GROUP OF A- THROUGHOUT FIELD AND PERHAPS DOING SOME KIND OF TOUR SO WITH WE ARE ABLE TO BE SEEN. AND HAVE INTERACTION WITH DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES- BUT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU IN THE PAST WE HAD FORTY THREE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT ORIGINALLY APPLIED TO BE CULTURAL DISTRICTS AND- ONE THING INTERESTING ABOUT THERE WERE SEVEN CRITERIA THAT WERE LIKE THAT AND- I DON'T SEE HER LIST THEM ALL FOR YOU BUT I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THOSE. FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE THAT BUT WHAT I WILL SHOW. YOU IS YOU KNOW THERE WERE- MANY AND THESE THAT WOULD BE FOR THAT AB CULTURAL DISTRICTS ADAM AUNT AND- THE PROBLEM WAS THEY JUST MIGHT WORK. THEY TELL SHIPS. HELLO DISTRICTS RIGHT AND DEFINE DEVELOP. REALLY FEEL THAT THOSE NASCENT ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE LIFTED BY THAT AND THAT WE WILL OPEN THE DOOR IN THIS THESE FUNDS WILL CERTAINLY OPEN THE DOOR FOR MANY MORE POSSIBILITIES. JUST TO CLARIFY TO WHAT CRISTINA THANK THE DEVELOPMENT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A TIERED FUNDING OPPORTUNITY FOR ALSO DISTRICTS GOING FORWARD THERE WILL BE A FULL ON COACH DISTRICT THAT AS THOSE PARTNERSHIP THIS KRISTIN. MENTIONED TO TRY FACT THAT THE BUSINESS THE ART ORGANIZATION AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY WOULD ORGAN IS THAT ARE DEVELOPING THAT THOSE PARTNERSHIPS AND THEY COULD- UP. FOR NAY BUT THE MONEY THAT GIVE THEM GAP TO APPLY THE NEXT YEAR FOR MORE AND- SO WE WERE TRY TO LOOK AT I THINK THAT'S A VERY. SIMPLE WAY TO LOOK AT FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES I THINK THE COUNSELORS. AS REALLY WEIGHED IN ON THAT AND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT MISSING. THOSE ORGAN SENSE THAT ARE. ALSO READY AND THEY JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE SUPPORT. AND WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO. THESE DISTRICTS HAVING A BURST PIPE BUT FUNDING PORTFOLIO BECAUSE OF THAT COOL SUSTAINABILITY RIGHT IT TOTALLY DOES. A REGIONALLY SUPPORTED. AND WHERE WHERE EVER THAT IF THEY HAVE FUN START TO. SLOW DOWN. VACANCY BE VIABLE YEAH WE ALSO APPRECIATE PETER KAMINSKY COMING BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS IS COALITION OF THEM AND SO IN DEVELOPING THESE NEW DISTRICTS WE DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT THESE FOURTEEN DISTRICTS WILL SERVE AS ROLE MODELS OR MENTORS FOR. AND I THINK THAT WILL REALLY HELP THEY'RE SUCH A CLOSE GROUP AND THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO ATTACK EACH OTHER. OKAY THAT WILL HELP. IN ORDER BRUCE COME TOGETHER FOR PARTNERSHIP HAVE IDEAS HOW. MUCH THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL BECAUSE OF A LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS JUST WHEN I LOOKED AT HIM- ALREADY HAVE RICH TERRACE TOURISM- BASIS AND- AND THAT GIVES THEM. THE RESOURCES BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING INTO THE AREA ALREADY- BUT IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE OFF THE BEATEN TRACK CAN YOU YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG TOURISM POPULATION. YOU THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND YOU LOVE THE AREA ANYWAY YOU DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ME IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO START UP BUT A DISTRICT I THINK THIS IS MY RIGHT WHICH IS WHY THE DEPARTMENT TO ADAM. PHASE AND- GRAHAM OPPORTUNITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT. RIGHT IT ISN'T AND WE DID SHARE WITH- A LIST OF. THREE THAT UP AND WE'LL SEE ON THAT LIST. BECAUSE IT IS. OFF THE PATH AND SO HOW DO WE FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THE THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THIS THIS MY INTEREST I HAVE OTHER FROM COMMITTEE YES. THANK YOU FOR ALL. I REALLY. LOOK AT CULTURE ON THE ARTS IN A WAY THAT HELP TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTHIER- AND SPECIALLY THAT KIDS GROWING UP BUT AT AGES IN ALL GENERATIONS SO I GUESS I'M GLAD THIS IS. HOLDEN HOLD THIS OPEN. A LOT OF ISSUES ABOUT THE- FOR ME TO AND THE DISTRICTS EVEN THOUGH I WAS HERE LAST YEAR- THE FUNDING WENT TO DIFFERENT. OF THE MUSEUM I WANT TO- DIFFERENT SOURCES BUT- THIS. YOU KNOW JUST ECONOMICALLY- YOU KNOW MOST OF THESE NEW DISTRICTS ARE OUR MOST OF THESE FOURTEEN DISTRICTS ARE IN. ABOVE THE POVERTY LEVEL YOU KNOW IN THE STATE- AND THERE'S OTHER ISSUES I'M NOT QUITE SURE EXACTLY HOW THE GRANT. WORK WITH THE DISTRICT- AND WHERE THAT LEVERAGING REALLY HAPPEN. HAPPY TO HEAR THAT- THIS IS. THIS IS A- LEVERAGE YOU KNOW OTHER FUNDING I DON'T SEE HOW AND WHERE THAT HAPPENS. AND TO HARD CHAIRS HERE EVEN A PLACE LIKE LOS ANGELES THAT HAS A LOT OF TOURISM THOSE TOURIST DOLLARS DONGLE INTO COMMUNITY NO WE CAN MEANING THEY DON'T GO INTO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ARE ALWAYS TREATED SEPARATELY FROM YOU KNOW THE BEACHES. GETTY MUSEUM RIGHT YEAH SO UNDERSTAND- EVEN IN IN AREAS WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF. TOURISM IT DOES I GET INTO THE- ENTITIES TO BE ABLE FOSTER THEY'RE ALWAYS AT THE EDGE YOU KNOW- NO LEAKS IN THE ROOF OF THIS LET ME KNOW THEATER AS IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THESE DOLLARS SO I REALLY WANT IT YOU KNOW DEEPER INTO HOW THIS ALL FITS TOGETHER- ALL. AND ALSO YOU KNOW TO KNOW THE OTHER DISTRICTS ARE HOW THEY HAVE FUNCTIONS WHAT'S BEEN THEIR SUCCESS HOW DO YOU MEASURE THE SUCCESS- AND HOW. ARTS COUNCIL IS HELPING TO GET DOLLARS I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT SO I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THIS ALL IS SO WE CAN USE THIS NO WAY HELP. ME IS A DON'T GET DOLLARS RIGHT AND NOT JUST FEEL THE REAL INFRASTRUCTURE. I THANK YOU. THIRTY MY COLLEAGUES A LITTLE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. THIS COUNCIL HAS COME A LONG WAY STE. MY WIFE SERVE THERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND REMEMBER YEARS THEIR WHOLE BUDGET WITH ONE MILLION DOLLARS REMEMBER AND THEY HAD TO GO GET MONEY WHATEVER THEY COULD FROM WHEREVER THEY COULD SO THE COUNCIL IS BECOME VERY ADEPT AT THAT. AND HERE WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A NOT A LUXURY OF SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO GREATLY EXPAND. A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE WERE EXPANDING AND I GUESS YOU'RE STILL DOING SOME MARGIN CORRECTIONS. WORK AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE HAD AN INSTITUTION FOR MANY YEARS AND THAT. THERE WAS NOTHING FOR AND THAT WAS ABLE TO BE REVITALIZED IF YOU WILL. SO I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE COUNCIL NOW AND THAT THEY HAVE SOME MORE RESOURCES. AND THE FUTURE. IT WAS A VERY VERY BLEAK TIME FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND I HAVE TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION TO YOU FOLKS- YOU IT TO COUNSEL LOW MARYLAND MY AFFINITY FOR ART. FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR MY STAFF COMMISSION THE PERSON WHO DOES THESE. WHAT CAR BEARS THE BLACK BEAR DINERS YEAH HE LIVES UP IN PARADISE. HE TOOK ONE OF THE TREES.

BUT HOW VERY APPROPRIATE FOR THE BATTLES THAT WE HAD WITH THE FIRE. STATION THIS IS A SMALL THING BUT TO SEE. PRODUCT OF THAT GREAT DISASTER. TRANSLATED INTO A BEAUTIFUL WORK OF ART. THAT WILL BE IN DURING AND UNDER A CONSTANT REMEMBRANCE OF THAT TRAGEDY AND HOW THAT COMMUNITY HAS COME BACK. FROM THE TRASH IT IT IT'S AN EXPANSION OF THE MISSION OF ART AND WHAT WE CAN DO WITH ART IN CALIFORNIA SO WHAT WILL THE FORTY WORKING WITH YOUNG.
