TO ME THIS IS A NATURAL

00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:25.656
EXTENSION OF WHAT WE'VE DONE ON

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:27.991
THE DISCLOSURE FRAUD THAT.

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:29.226

00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:30.661
CAMPAIGN SIDE.

00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:32.396
IN MY WAY OF THINKING.

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:35.332
OF THE ISSUES THAT WE GRAPPLE

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:36.200

00:45:36.266 --> 00:45:37.801
LEGISLATIVE SIDE.

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:39.837
OF THIS EQUATION ARE EVEN MORE

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:41.839
IMPORTANT THAN THE CAMPAIGN SIDE

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:43.574
BECAUSE ACTUAL PUBLIC BUSINESSES

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.275
BEING DECIDED THIS BUILDING.

00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:46.510
I THINK WE NEED TO PROVIDE SOME

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:49.780
CONTEXT. FOR VIEWERS OF A

00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:51.615
TELEVISION AD.

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:52.749
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE?

00:45:52.816 --> 00:45:55.586
AND WHAT THEIR PERSPECTIVE MIGHT

00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:56.720
BE I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH

00:45:56.787 --> 00:45:59.123
INFORMATION COMING OUT.

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:00.524
THE AVERAGE VOTER.

00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:02.226
IF WE GET AT LEAST PROVIDE A

00:46:02.292 --> 00:46:04.261
SENSE OF WHO THE MAJOR FUNDERS

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:05.496
ARE BEHIND THAT ORGANIZATION

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:07.564
THESE ARE THESE ARE MAJOR

00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:09.066
FUNDERS BEHIND THAT GROUP.

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:11.001
AND THAT GROUP HAS CHOSEN TO TRY

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:13.137
TO INFLUENCE THIS BODIES PUBLIC

00:46:13.203 --> 00:46:14.371
WORK.

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:16.039

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:18.075
LAYER OF CONTEXT FOR THE PUBLIC

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:20.744
AND BY EXTENSION THE PUBLIC

00:46:20.811 --> 00:46:21.812
INTEREST IS SERVED.

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:22.880
YOUR POINT THOUGH ABOUT

00:46:22.946 --> 00:46:25.516
SPECIFYING THAT THAT

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:28.051
CONTRIBUTION IS SPECIFICALLY

00:46:28.118 --> 00:46:31.155
DESIGNED TO RUN AN ADVERTISEMENT.

00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:33.123
I CAN LOOK AT THAT ISSUE AND SEE

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:35.292
IF THERE'S A WAY TO TIGHTEN THAT.

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:37.728
TO DRAW THAT NEXUS I DON'T KNOW

FROM A LEGAL OR EVEN A

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:40.664
CONSTITUTIONAL STANDPOINT IF

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:43.367
