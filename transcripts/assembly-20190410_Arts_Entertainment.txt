SUBCOMMITTEE STARTED -- SO WE WILL GO BY THE THE FILE ORDER OF TIME THE FIRST ONE WILL BE. FROM -- MEMBER. BOEHNER HARBOR US BURNER BURNER ALRIGHT. YOUR PERCENT DEAN BILL AB. FOR SIXTY SEVEN ARE YOU HAVE WITNESSES. PLEASE COME FORWARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD MORNING TODAY MY NAME IS TASHA BOERNER HORVATH AND I AM PRESENTING AB. FOR SIXTY SEVEN TO REQUIRE EQUAL PRIVATE PAY A PRICE. A PRICE TO PAY FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN ATHLETES WHEN COMPETING ON IN STATE PROPERTIES FOR RECREATION -- I THINK ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ASPECTS OF AB FOR SIXTY SEVEN IS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ON OUR PUBLIC LANDS THEY REFLECT THE VALUES OF OUR STATE AND OUR VALUES OF OUR STATE OUR QUALITY AND EQUITY -- ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN AND AND THE SPORTS WORLD ESPECIALLY THE INDEPENDENT NONTRADITIONAL SPORTS. IS THAT WOMEN ARE PAID SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN MEN ACROSS THE BOARD AND IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WAS -- VERY -- IMPORTANT STATE LANDS COMMISSION DECISION THAT REQUIRED THE MAVERICKS SURF CONTEST -- TO REQUIRE PAY EQUITY FOR MALE AND FEMALE THE CHAMPIONS AND THIS WAS A GAME CHANGER SO OUR BILL IS ELOQUENT IN ITS SIMPLICITY. IT SAYS IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE GIVEN A LAND USE PERMIT OR A LAND LEASE YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE PAY EQUITY FOR MEN AND WOMEN DIVISIONS. AND THAT IS SO SIMPLE AND IT IS SO ELOQUENT AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK THAT WE CODIFY THIS DECISION. INTO STATE LAW BECAUSE THIS WILL AFFECT NOT ONLY THE SURFING WORLD BUT IN THE SKATEBOARDING WORLD IN THE IRON MAN'S IN TRIATHLONS AND GROWING AND SWIMMING. ON STATE LANDS. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT IT I THINK OUR ALL THE LITTLE GIRLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEED TO LOOK TO THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS I KNOW THAT WE HAVE THEIR BACKS. THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY EQUITY IN ALL FORMS AND I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT. THESE ATHLETES COMPETE ON OUR STATE LANDS THIS IS WHERE THEY WORK THIS IS WHERE THEY COMPETE RESERVOIR PERFORM THERE'S WHERE COMPENSATED. AND NO OTHER SPACE WILL WE EVER ALLOW. PAY IN EQUITY AND SO THIS BILL CODIFIES A VERY SIMPLE PRINCIPLE. I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'M SO THRILLED TODAY TO HAVE TWO AMAZING WITNESSES. FIRST WE HAVE COREY SHOE MARKER. CORY IS NOT ONLY A COUNCIL MEMBER AND MY DISTRICT IN CARLSBAD -- SHE IS A THREE TIME WOMEN LONGBOARD SURF CHAMPION WORLD SURF CHAMPION AND THE FIRST OPENLY GAY WORLD SURF CHAMPION. AND I'M SO PROUD TO HAVE HER ACCOUNT YET SHE DOES WORK PART TIME IN MY DISTRICT SHE IS HERE ON HER OWN MONEY SHE IS HERE ON HER OWN TIME SHE TOOK TODAY OFF -- TO BE HERE AND I'M SO HONOR BECAUSE IN IN OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS BEFORE I WAS ELECTED THE SYMBOL ASSEMBLY. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR QUALITY IN CALIFORNIA AND IS WHEN I DECIDED THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST BILL I INTRODUCED IN THE ASSEMBLY -- I ALSO HAVE WITH ME -- CAM WOOZY WHO IS A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE ADVOCATE AND DIRECTOR OF DEVELOPMENT FOR SKATE LIKE A GIRL SERVICES GO BEARISH AS MANY CREDENTIALS THAT SHE'LL TELL US ABOUT -- I AM SO HONORED TO BE HERE AMONG THE PRESENCE OF THESE WOMEN WHO HAVE PAVE THE WAY FOR A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN'S ALL TURNED OVER TO QUESTIONS. THANKS MUCH SIMPLY MEMBER -- VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE IN FRONT OF YOU THIS MORNING FOR ME -- I STARTED SURFING WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD SORRY WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD I STARTED COMPETING WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD. AND WOMEN'S ONLY SURF LEAGUE -- AND OVER THE LAST THIRTY TWO YEARS I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A REALLY -- UGH. PINNACLE MOMENT FOR A LOT OF THE WORK THAT HAS GONE ON AND THAT HAVE BEEN A PART OF SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. SO HAVING COMPETED SINCE I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD -- AND THEN VERY SPECIFICALLY WORKING ON WOMEN'S EQUITY WITHIN THE SPORT OF SURFING. OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS SPECIFICALLY I CAN TELL YOU THAT SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES THAT I HAD. A DESPITE HAVING EQUAL ACCESS TO SERVING SPACES -- WAS DIRECTLY LINKED TO NOT HAVING PAY EQUITY -- AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR INSTANCE MALE ATHLETES BEING GIVEN SALARIES UPWARDS OF A MILLION DOLLARS VERSUS A FEMALE ATHLETE SITTING AT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SO THE DISPARITIES MASSIVE --% THIS BILL -- IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP MOVING FOR TO ACHIEVING WHAT WE NEED IN IN THE REALM OF SPORTS. AND HAVING -- HAVING DONE THE WORK OF NOT ONLY SITUATIONAL AS AN ADVOCATE AND AN ATHLETE BUT ALSO ACADEMICIN EMERGING CRITICAL SIR STUDIES AND BEING A PRINCIPAL THEORIST OF SIR FEMINISM -- WHICH IS A AN INVITING EMBEDDED NOMADIC SOCIO POLITICAL INTERVENTION SITUATED AT THE NEXUS OF SPORT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AS THIS IS EMERGING -- THIS WORK -- ACTUALLY PROVIDES REALLY INTERESTING POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES I'M SITTING HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT A THREE TIME WOMEN'S WORLD SURFING CHAMPION AS A UP THAT COUNCIL MEMBER AND BEING ABLE TO FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE OF IT SIGNIFICANT -- THESE EMBEDDED POLITICAL -- SUBJECTIVITY IS THAT CAN BE CREATED THROUGH SPORT -- WE GIVE -- WOMEN GIRLS THE OPPORTUNITY AND SUCH ONE LOOP BACK AROUND AND AND SAY THAT -- SERVING BECAME THE FIRST US BASED SPORTS LEAGUE TO ACHIEVE PRIZE MONEY EQUITY. THIS PAST YEAR. THE FIRST WOMAN TO RECEIVE EQUAL PRIZE MONEY ON THE TOUR HAPPENED. THREE DAYS AGO. SO FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME A FEMALE ATHLETE FEMALE PROFESSIONAL SURFING ATHLETE WAS ABLE -- TO WALK AWAY WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST AS HER MALE HERE WHERE IS PREVIOUSLY SHE MIGHT WALK AWAY WITH A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO I JUST ABOUT HALF AND WOMEN IN EVERY SPORT EVERY LEVEL IN EVERY EVERY SPORT AT EVERY LEVEL DESERVE TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT FEELS. TO SEE THIS MOMENT OF TRUE EMPOWERMENT HAPPEN -- FOR ONE'S COLLEAGUES AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ONE SPORTS ABOUT ALL SPORTS -- EMPOWERING NEXT GENERATION OF OUR LEADERS KNEW POLITICAL ALLIES WHO UNDERSTAND THAT FALLING DOWN IS JUST ONE STEP IN RISING UP. IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND I WOULD URGE A YES AND I VOTE OF THIS BILL AS IT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. HI. MY NAME IS KIM -- THREE ZERO I AM ACTUALLY A PRODUCT OF TITLE NINE GREW UP PLAYING SPORTS -- TODAY I AM A SKATEBOARDER AN ENTREPRENEUR AND COMMUNITY LEADER -- I AM THE CO FOUNDER AND PARTNER OF THE W. SAY THE WOMEN SKATEBOARDING ALLIANCE WE ARE A GLOBAL ADVOCACY.

AGE CLASS RACE AND GENDER AND SKATEBOARDING RELEASE ABLE TO TEACH SELF ADVOCACY SELF EXPRESSION AND COMMUNITY BUILDING -- SKATEBOARDS OF ACTUALLY BECOME A RADICAL VEHICLE FOR TRANSFORMATION FOR MANY MARGINALIZED GROUPS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING WOMEN -- FOR ME IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT DISTINGUISH EQUITY VERSUS A QUALITY HISTORICALLY IN SKATEBOARDING WOMEN HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED OBJECTIFIED AND IN TREATED UNEQUALLY. AND FOR ME HAVING SPENT THE PAST DECADE REALLY ELEVATING WOMEN I EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF SPACE FOR WOMEN ONLY EVENTS ORGANIZATIONS AND BROWN'S. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THESE GIRLS AND WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE. BEING HEARD PRIORITIZE AND SPOTLIGHTED -- AND YOU KNOW I BY SUPPORT AB FOUR SIX SEVEN THEY SEE THE PAY EQUITY IS ONE OF THE WAYS TO TRULY ACHIEVE GENDER EQUALITY. AND I JUST WILL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE -- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN X.

GOOD MORNING CHAIRPERSON CHIU AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M SABRINA BRENNAN PRESIDENT OF THE SAN MATEO COUNTY HARBOR COMMISSION. AND CO FOUNDER OF THE COMMITTEE FOR EQUITY IN WOMEN SURFING. THANK YOU FOR THIS IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE THIS MORNING I AWOKE TO A REOCCURRING NIGHTMARE ABOUT GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE. UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND THE SYSTEMATIC EXCLUSION OF WOMEN PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES FROM COMPETITIONS. TODAY I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE SAN MATEO COUNTY HARPER DISTRICT. WE ISSUE A SPECIAL USE PERMIT FOR THE ICONIC MAVERICKS CHALLENGE BIG WAVE SURF COMPETITION. HELD NEAR HALF MOON BAY. MAVERICKS WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND THE CONTEST IS INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN FOR PRODUCING THIRTY TO SIXTY FOOT WAVES. AND IT'S EVENT PROMOTERS ARE NOTORIOUS FOR GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION. THE FIRST MEMBERS COMPETITION WAS TITLED MAN WHO RIDE MOUNTAINS NOW TWO DECADES LATER WOMEN BIG WAVE SURFERS HAVE STILL NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE EQUAL PAY AN ATHLETIC COMPETITION THAT EXCLUDE WOMEN. PLEASE READ THE MARCH TWENTY NINTH LETTER FROM THE HARBOR COMMISSION WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT AB FOR SIX SEVEN BE AMENDED TO PROTECT ATHLETES FROM GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION. CONSISTENT WITH THE HONOREE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WE URGE YOU TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES PLEASE CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE IN AB. FOUR SIX SEVEN THAT ENCOURAGES AND INCENTIVIZE IS EVENT BUSINESSES PROMOTERS AND ATHLETIC ORGANIZATIONS TO EXCLUDE FEMALE CATEGORIES FROM ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS. IN AN EFFORT TO THE WORK EQUAL PAY REQUIREMENTS PLEASE REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING A FEMALE CATEGORY AND A MALE CATEGORY FOR ALL ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS HELD ON CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS. EQUAL PRIZE MONEY. CATEGORY WINNERS RECEIVING THE EXACT SAME PRICE AMOUNT. NO TOTAL PURSE FORMULA APPLIED. EQUAL LOGISTICAL SUPPORT FOR ALL CATEGORIES INCLUDING TRAVEL RELATED EXPENSES AIRFARE HOTEL ETCETERA. EQUAL EQUIPMENT FOR ALL CATEGORIES MAVERICKS IS NOT THE ONLY PROFESSIONAL ATHLETIC COMPETITION WITH THE HISTORY OF GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION. LAST MONTH WOMEN WERE EXCLUDED FROM COMPETING IN HUNTINGTON BEACH AT THE JACKS. SURFBOARDS PRO A WORLD SURF LEAGUE FIFTEEN HUNDRED QUALIFYING SERIES OF THAT. THAT AWARDS PRIZE MONEY AND POINTS WOMEN PRO SURFERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SCARCITY OF QUALIFYING EVENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS INEQUITY SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITS THEIR OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE A LIVING AS PRO ATHLETES. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF EVENTS AND AWARDS FOR WOMEN AS WELL AS OFFERING EQUAL PRIZE MONEY IS THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL EQUITY IN COMPETITIVE SPORTS. EQUAL PAY IS ONLY PART OF THE PROBLEM PLEASE REQUIRE THAT ALL STATE AGENCY PERMITS AND LEASES PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION. PLEASE AMEND AB FOUR SIX SEVEN TWO REQUIRED BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT MANAGE. AND PROMOTE ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS ON CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMPLY WITH THE UN RESELL RIGHTS ACT. UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES PREVENT WOMEN PROFESSIONAL SURFERS FROM UTILIZING PUBLIC RESOURCES AND COASTAL ACCESS PLEASE ACT TO PROHIBIT GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION PLEASE ENSURE THAT AB FOR SIX SEVEN PROVIDES. THE OVERSIGHT NECESSARY TO STOP DECADES OF GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION. THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION PLEASE COME [inaudible] FOR SURE. DO YOU HOW DO. WHAT WE HEARD THE OUT DATED THE REMAINING ON? THE POSITION IS. HELLO THIS IS IT WHOA WHOA WHOA. OPPOSITION LOW THIS FINISH THIS IS SAM MY POSITION IS SUPPORT IF AMENDED AND WE DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WASN'T CALLED OUT -- I'M SEEING A NOD FROM MISS MITCHELL SO IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME I'D LIKE TO OFFER A POSITION OF SUPPORT IF AMENDED OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- GOOD MORNING CHAIRPERSON CHEWING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KAREN TIENEN. I'M THE FOUNDING COUNSEL FOR THE COMMITTEE OF IT ON FOR EQUITY AND WOMEN'S SURFING -- BRIEFLY I HAVE -- TWO QUICK POINTS TO MAKE -- WITH REGARD TO THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION -- AND MAVERICKS I WAS THE PERSON THAT DRAFTED THAT LEAST LANGUAGE THE NON DISCRIMINATORY LANGUAGE. I DO CONSIDER MYSELF A VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSON ABOUT THAT ISSUE. AND THAT IS ONE REASON WHY I SUPPORT IF AMENDED. AND SECONDLY I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE FIRST TIME A WOMAN SURFER RECEIVED EQUAL PAY WAS IN NOVEMBER. AT THE PALEY CHALLENGE IN HAWAII -- BASED UPON -- OUR WORK FROM THE COMMITTEE WITH THE WORLD SURF LEAGUE. AND PART OF HOW THE COMMITTEE FOR EQUITY IN WOMEN SURFING WAS ABLE -- TO LEVERAGE THE WORLD SURF LEAGUE INTO REQUIRING PAY EQUITY. WAS THROUGH A TWO PRONG. ANALYSIS. OF ACCESS AND PAY PARITY WE DEMANDED ACCESS FOR THE WOMEN WHICH IS WHY WE WANT AND AMENDED AB FOUR SIX SEVEN TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE UNREST CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. BY INCORPORATING A CONCISE REFERENCE TO THE UNREST CIVIL RIGHTS ACT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION MY NAME IS SOUL AND I AM A SUPPORT IF AMENDED. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- THANK YOU WOULD YOU USUALLY ALLOWED TO WITNESSES AND ADDITIONAL WITNESSES SO I WOULD JUST PLEASE ASK YOU TO STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION AND YOUR POSITION OF COURSE. I AM IN SUPPORT OF AB FOUR SIX SEVEN IF AMENDED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER -- WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD AND STATE YOUR NAME AND A FULL AFFILIATION. NO ONE SORRY WOULD WE HAVE WERE ONLY ALLOWED -- TO OF WITNESSES TO TESTIFY [inaudible] HELLO. MY NAME IS PRINTER I'M A CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS ISSUE FOR QUITE SOME TIME I JUST WANTED TO MENTION I ALSO SUPPORT THIS OF AMENDED AN ASSOCIATE MYSELF. WITH COMMENTS OF SABRINA BRENNAN THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ALL RIGHT. WELL AT THIS TIME -- JUST OPEN UP THE DíAS FLOW INTO MEMBERS. THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE WITNESS WHO SPOKE IN OPPOSITION -- SO YOUR OBJECTION JUST SO I UNDERSTAND IT IS THAT YOU SUPPORT THE SPIRIT OF THE BILL BUT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CONTEST HAS A MAN A MALE AND A FEMALE DIVISION. SO MY QUESTION IS WHAT ABOUT -- SPORTING EVENTS WERE THEY WOULD JUST HAVE IT OPEN TO MEN AND WOMEN IN THE SAME DIVISION WOULD THAT BE AN OPTION AS WELL -- ACTUALLY. TO CLARIFY I AM ALSO THE CO FOUNDER OF THE COMMITTEE FOR EQUITY AND WOMEN SERVING IN ADDITION TO BEING THE PRESIDENT OF THE SAN MATEO COUNTY HARBOR COMMISSION. AND IT'S KIND OF AN INTERESTING QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED BECAUSE THE COMMITTEE FOR EQUITY IN WOMEN SURFING WHAT WE SUPPORT SOME WEARING THAT HAT RIGHT NOW. IS WE SUPPORT THREE CATEGORIES WE SUPPORT AND MEN'S CATEGORY A WOMEN'S CATEGORY AND AN OPEN NON BINARY CATEGORY. THE HARBOR COMMISSION WHICH IS A FIVE MEMBER BOARD SUPPORTS AND MEN'S CATEGORY AND WOMEN'S CATEGORY BECAUSE THAT'S CURRENTLY WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE MAVERICKS SURF COMPETITION AND THAT'S THE EVENT. THAT WE PERMIT SO. SLIGHTLY TO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITIONS LIKE SURFING IS NOT THE ONLY SPORT THAT COULD BE HELD IN A PUBLIC LAND SO THAT'S CORRECT SO IF IF THE BILL WAS CRAFTED SO THE BILL'S NOT JUST BEING CRAFTED FIRST FOR SURFING. SO ASSUMING THAT THERE COULD BE BECAUSE IS A STATE WIDE THIS COULD BE ANY PUBLIC LAND IT MIGHT NOT BE A COASTAL PUBLIC LAND IT COULD BE COMPLETELY OTHER SPORTS. WOULD YOU BE OKAY WITH SOMETHING WHERE A SPORTING EVENT COULD DO OF MAN AND MAN AND A WOMAN EVENT OR JUST AN OPEN EVENT FOR WHOEVER IT COMPLETELY DEPENDS ON THAT SPORT SO IN CYCLING I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY NOT THERE NEEDS TO BE. A MEN'S DIVISION OR CATEGORY AND A WOMEN'S CATEGORY OR DIVISION AND THERE WOULD BE A MEN'S RACE OR A WOMEN'S RACE OR SUGGEST THEN THAT THE BILL. ACTUALLY LIST EVERY ALL THE DIFFERENT SPORTS AND THEN SAY WHETHER OR NOT AN OPEN. CATEGORY WOULD BE PERMISSIBLE FOR THAT SPORT AS OPPOSED TO A SEPARATE MEN BECAUSE THERE ARE SPORTS WHERE WOMEN ACTUALLY WANT TO COMPETE. WITH THE MEN IN AN OPEN -- COMPETITION WE DON'T KNOW OF ANY SPORTS LIKE THAT THAT ARE HELD ON STATE LANDS IF YOU CAN THINK OF ONE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS. I DON'T KNOW THE LIST OF ALL THE ALL THE SPORTS THAT ARE ON STATE LANDS BUT I USED TO PLAY. OUR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS WHERE THE WOMEN VERY MUCH WANTED TO THE TIMES PLAY WITH THE MEN HAND OFF SOMETIMES WHEN ALLOWED TO WELL IF OUR SPORTS LIKE THAT THANK YOU I I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT WE HAVE LOOKED AT WHAT. THE SPORTS THAT ARE BEING PLAYED PROFESSIONALLY ON PUBLIC LANDS AND ON STATE LAND WE HAVEN'T FOUND ANY WHERE THERE ARE -- LEAKS THAT WANT TO PLAY WITH BOTH MEN AND WOMEN IN THE SAME COMPETITIVE CATEGORY SO WE JUST HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T FOUND THAT. YEAH BUT AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED FOR PRO ATHLETES THAT ARE WOMEN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT FINANCIALLY IN THE WORKPLACE AS ATHLETES. THEY ABSOLUTELY CAN'T COMPETE AGAINST MEN BECAUSE IF THEY DO THAT THEY WON'T WIN AND THEY WON'T GET THE PRIZE MONEY THAT THEY NEED. TO FURTHER THEIR SPORT THERE'S NO WAY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO STICK WITH THE SPORT SO A BOXES GIRLS OUT IT BOXES WOMEN OUT IF I UNDERSTAND I THINK I ANSWERED THE QUESTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU A THREE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE DAYS -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER. BURN A HARMLESS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH -- I APPRECIATE THE I I JUST WANT -- TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT THAT MISS BROWN IS HERE WITH A I BELIEVE SUPPORT WITH AS A IF AMENDED POSITION NOT IN OPPOSITION IS THAT CORRECT WE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE SORT SUPPORTIVE AMENDED BUT WE'VE. THANK YOU VERY HELPS A LOT OF THIS LAST NIGHT OUT SO -- I WANT TO CLARIFY FOR MY COLLEAGUES AND AND MY CO AUTHORS OF THIS BILL THIS BILL IS A SINGLE ISSUE BILL AND IS DOING WITH PAY COMPENSATION. WE ARE NOT LOOKING AT INCLUSION AT THIS TIME AND THIS BILL -- AS WE KNOW ALL OVER BILLS ARE YOU SINGLE -- SUBJECT BILLS AND AND JUST LOOKING AT PAY EQUITY AND ATHLETIC CONTESTS ON THE STATE OF LANCE. SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT I APPRECIATE THE ADVOCACY OF THE MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WHO SUPPORT THE MOMENTS WE WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO AND AND TRACKING -- THE DIFFERENT ATHLETIC CONTESTS I THINK AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN CORRECTLY POINTED OUT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT ATHLETIC CONTEST THIS AFFECTS NOT JUST SURFING -- AND NOT JUST IN OUR COASTAL AREAS CYCLING IS A VERY BIG ONE WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF INEQUITIES AND PAY COMPENSATION. AND WE HAVE TO ALSO REMEMBER IT'S NOT JUST THE PRO SPORTS IS ALL THE QUALIFYING MEETS THAT. LEAD UP TO IT WHERE THIS BILL WOULD IN FACT AND I THINK THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE WE START TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND WE SHOW THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE THEIR BACK AND WE WILL MAKE THIS CHANGE AND WE WILL TRACK ANYTHING -- FURTHER WE WILL BE SUBMITTING A COMMENT TO THE JOURNAL -- WITH THE INTENTION THAT THIS BILL IS IN NO WAY TO ELIMINATE ANY -- EXISTING FEMALE CATEGORIES BECAUSE OF THIS BILL CENSURE THAT THE RECORD IS STRAIGHT ON WHAT THE INTENTION AS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURNER -- HALL BETS FOR YOUR HARD WORK I I I LIKE TO SIMPLE BILL. YOU KNOW THIS BILL DOES ENJOY AND I RECOMMENDATION FROM THOSE CHAIR. AND THINGS WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT IT WOULD DO HAVE A QUORUM BUT WE LOST SOME A MEMBERS HE ATE YOU. I HAVE -- YOU'LL YOU'LL ON THE YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENT PLEASE. YEAH SO -- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO COMMEND. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD -- IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IT'S NOT EASY AND IT'S TIME THAT WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT PROFESSIONAL SPORTS AND ABOUT THE ROLE OF OUR STATE LANDS AND WHAT WE CAN DO THAT. TO HELP WITH THE EFFORT OF SUPPORTING WOMEN SPORTS SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- I HAVE I DO HAVE -- THE SAME CONCERN ABOUT -- PROMOTERS NOT WANTING. TO HAVE PAY EQUITY -- AND NOT WANTING TO HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL EXPENSE AND CUTTING THE WOMEN'S EVENTS OUT OF THEIR PROGRAMS. AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT YOUR INTENTION BUT IT COULD BE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FAR AS I SEE IT AND INTENT LANGUAGE ISN'T GONNA BE ENOUGH TO STOP SOMEONE HAS TO THERE HAS TO BE A STRONGER WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT'S PROHIBITED. AND WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO POLICE EVERY EVENT ACROSS THE STATE IN EVERY -- STATE LAND SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU ADDRESS AS YOU MOVE THE BILL FORWARD -- I DO THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION FOR PEOPLE TO DO THE MIX STANDARD EVENTS IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS ONE THAT'S APPROPRIATE I PLAY PROFESSIONAL SPORTS IN A SPORT WHERE WOMEN DO -- NOW ARE NOW BEGINNING TO PLAY ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH MEN CERTAINLY NOT EVERY WOMAN NOT EVERY CATEGORY BUT WE HAVE SOME WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH AND WANTED TO PLAY WITH THE MEN AND HISTORICALLY WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF WOMEN. WHO WERE DENIED THE ABILITY TO DO THAT SO I THINK WE'RE WE DON'T WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN SPORTS CAN BE INTEGRATED IN THAT WAY THAT WE DON'T STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING THAT WE HELP ENCOURAGE THAT? SO THERE MIGHT BE A WAY OF WRITING THAT IN WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR CERTAIN AREAS -- BUT AS SOMEONE WHO DID PLAY ON A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL I ABSOLUTELY EXPERIENCE -- TO KIND OF THE SHAME OF THE PAY AND EQUITY. AND OF ALWAYS BEING KIND OF THE SECOND CLASS YOU KNOW JUST YOU KNOW THE KIDS TABLE OF THE SPORT. IF YOU WILL SO I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE ADVOCATES AND THE ATHLETES WHO ARE HERE AND I ANYTIME AN ATHLETE BRINGS OF FEMINISM FEMINIST CRITICAL THEORY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A LOT OF PROPS -- THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THAT SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

AB FIFTY NINETY TWO WOULD ESTABLISH LICENSURE REGULATIONS. AND THE SUPERVISORY. BOARD OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS UNDER EXISTING LAW THE PROFESSION OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS IS UNREGULATED. IN FACT CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT DOES NOT REGULATE. THE PROFESSION CURRENTLY SOMEONE HAS NOT COMPLETED AN ATHLETIC TRAINER EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM OR PASSED THE NATIONAL CERTIFICATION EXAM CAN STILL CALL THEMSELVES. AN ATHLETIC TRAINER THIS LACK OF REGULATION PUT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS COLLEGE STUDENTS PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER CALIFORNIANS AT SEVERE. RISK OF HARM ATHLETIC TRAINERS ARE OFTEN RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS CONCUSSIONS AND HE DAHLE MRS AND SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST A MISTAKE FROM AN ATHLETIC TRAINER. COULD LEAD TO INJURY DISABILITY AND EVEN DEATH -- IT'S EXTREMELY UNFORTUNATE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS NO REGULATION FOR ATHLETIC TRAINERS AS THEY TEND TO THE DOCKING NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND ATHLETES AND THIS MEASURE IS LONG OVERDUE. OTHER FOR TO WORKING TOGETHER TO FIND THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE HERE OF SCOPE AND SUPERVISION FOR ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND OTHERS MORE WORK TO DO. IN THOSE AREAS AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE ANALYSIS SO WE CAN FINALLY BRING -- THE NECESSARY PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS ATHLETES AND STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE WITH ME HERE TODAY IS MICHAEL CHOOSE ARE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ATHLETIC TRAINERS ASSOCIATION.

STERN AND THE NAVAL ACADEMY SO I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR QUITE AWHILE FORTY SEVEN YEARS. I I HELP -- SPONSOR BILL TRY TO GET A BILL THROUGH -- IN NEW JERSEY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND WE SUCCEEDED AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF GETTING IT THROUGH SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH THIS AND KNOW THAT. AFTER THE TRAINING IS CHANGED A LOT SINCE I'VE WORKED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN PART OF IT IS THAT. PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO TRY TO HELP AND THIS STATE NOT HAVING AN ATHLETIC TRAINER THAT IS CERTIFIED IN MANY SITUATIONS -- CAN BE HARMFUL -- TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BEING TREATED WHAT I WANT TO SHOW IS THAT PRESENTLY HAVING SERVED IN COLLEGES FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THAT I'M WORKING MORE OF A CLINICAL SITUATION -- I'M AS CIVIL SERVICE -- PERSON WORKING FOR THE MILITARY AND IN THAT -- ROLE IT IS WORKING IN A CLINICAL POSITION I DON'T GO OUT ON THE FIELD AND AND TAKE CARE OF THE AND INJURED SEALS IN THOSE SITUATIONS WE HAVE HOSPITAL CORPSMAN. FOR BUT IN THE CLINICAL SITUATION I TAKE CARE OF THEM AND AND TO SHOW THAT I WORK WITH THREE PHYSICAL THERAPIST AND WE ALL WORK EQUALLY. IN WHAT WE DO AND USE OUR EXPERTISE TO TRY -- TO MAKE THOSE INDIVIDUALS GO BACK INTO THE ACTION THAT THEY HAVE TO DO AND THE ACTION IS NOT ATHLETICS AS SUCH IT CERTAINLY IS ATHLETIC NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOME OF THESE THINGS. BUT THEY ARE TRULY WORK EXPERIENCES THEY'RE DOING IN A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE BACKGROUND THAT WE RECEIVE IN TREATING ATHLETE'S INFORMATICS SITUATIONS. RE HAVING THEM AND FUNCTIONALLY BRING THEM BACK IS VERY IMPORTANT TO TRY TO GET THE MOST EXPERTISE WE CAN AND AGAIN IT'S BEEN -- SHOWN THAT THEY AFFECT TRAINERS MABEL TO DO THAT RECENTLY THE MARINE CORPS HAS PUT AN ATHLETIC TRAINER WITH EACH OF THE BRIGADES. AND DEBT IN SAN DIEGO THE SMART CLINICS HAVE THREE ATHLETIC TRAINERS. TO MOVE MORE MY STUDENTS AND ONE WAS A FORMER ASSISTANT OF MINE AND THERE ARE THREE TRAINERS WITH A DIFFERENT BRIGADES IN THEIR TRAINING SO THEY OTHER AREAS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE ATHLETE TRAINING CAN DO. A LOT TO HELP SUPPORT AND IT'S NOT JUST IN THE TRADITIONAL SIDE OF BEING ON THE SIDE OF THE FIELD WHICH I DID FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS -- BUT IN THE CLINICAL SIDE OF TRYING TO GET PEOPLE ON BACK BETTER AND TRY TO GET THEM BACK INTO WHATEVER THE FUNCTIONS THAT THEY NEED TO DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL BUSINESSES IN SUPPORT. PLEASE COME [inaudible] FOR OPPOSITION. YEAH -- I'M SORRY. WHAT CARD? ALONE LARA. I AM IN SUPPORT MY NAME IS HEATHER KRAMER AND I'M AN ATHLETIC TRAINER WITH ELDORADO PHYSICAL THERAPY. AND I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I'VE BEEN WORKING IN PHYSICAL THERAPY FOR ALMOST SEVENTEEN YEARS AND THE CLINIC THAT I'M WITH NOW I'VE BEEN WITH FOR FOURTEEN AND A HALF YEARS. AND IT IS BEEN A GREAT PRIVILEGE OF MINE TO WORK IN PHYSICAL THERAPY AND WORK WITH A LOT OF OTHER PROFESSIONALS WHETHER IT'S PHYSICAL THERAPISTS OR PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSISTANTS ANOTHER ATHLETIC TRAINERS. WE HAVE THREE CLINICS AND WE HAVE FOURTEEN PHYSICAL THERAPISTS SEVEN PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSISTANTS AND FOR ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND WE WORK IN A VERY COLLABORATIVE. TEAM APPROACH MY BOSS SINCE THEY STARTED THE COMPANY TWENTY YEARS AGO. HE IMMEDIATELY SAW THE VALUE OF HAVING ATHLETIC TRAINERS IN HIS CLINICS TO HELP TREAT PATIENTS I SEE PATIENTS FROM AGES THREE ALL THE WAY UP TO NINETY NINE AND I'M WORKING. IN CONJUNCTION WITH PHYSICAL THERAPISTS THEY SEE THAT WHAT I BRING TO THE TABLE MY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE MY DIFFERENT SKILL SETS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I GET IN MY SCHOOLING IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY GET AND I BRING. A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE TO THE TABLE AND SO WE WORK SIDE BY SIDE TREATING ALL OF THESE PATIENTS ON A DAILY BASIS I'M IN THE CLINIC ALL DAY LONG TREATING PATIENTS. AND THEY'VE ALWAYS SEEN THE VALUE OF HAVING ATHLETIC TRAINERS THERE BECAUSE WE DO MORE THAN JUST PROVIDE EXERCISES AND STRETCHES AND TAPING. WHERE THERE TO PROVIDE MANUAL SKILLS TO HELP EVALUATE INJURIES TO HELP DETERMINE THE NEXT STEP OF WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR THOSE PATIENTS? AND WE'RE NOT JUST SIMPLY PEOPLE THEY'RE STANDING ON THE SIDELINE HANDING OUT WATER AND TAPING ANKLES THERE'S SO MUCH MORE I HAVE A DOCTORATE IN ATHLETIC TRAINING AND MY BOSS WAS VERY VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT ME IN THAT ENDEAVOR. TO SEE ME BRING EVEN MORE INTO OUR CLINIC AND BE ABLE TO BRING BETTER PATIENT CARE TO OUR PATIENTS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT THEM FROM A PHYSICAL THERAPY STANDPOINT I'M LOOKING AT THEM FROM A BIOMECHANICAL STANDPOINT. A FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENT STANDPOINT IF THEY ARE ATHLETES WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO GET HIM BACK ON TO THE FIELD OR THE COURT IF THEY'RE GOING INTO A WORK SITUATION WHAT WE LOOK AT BIO MECHANICALLY HOW CAN THEY GO BACK INTO. THEIR MOVEMENTS THAT THEY NEED FOR WORK IN THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT AS AN ATHLETIC TRAINER I HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAT I BRING TO PHYSICAL THERAPY. AND CAN WORK IN CONJUNCTION AND VERY VERY WELL WITH ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES AS I SAID I'VE BEEN THERE FOR OVER FOURTEEN YEARS WITH THIS COMPANY. AND IT'S BEEN A REALLY GREAT BLESSING FOR ME SO I I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT.

CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON HOW ATHLETIC WE ARE HEALTH PHYSICAL WE ARE HOW MUCH WE LOVE THE OUTDOORS. AND IT IS DISTRESSING THAT WE ARE THE ONLY ONE OF FORTY NINE OF FIFTY STATES FORTY NINE OTHERS.

PLEASE VARNUM WITH UC DAVIS SPORTS MEDICINE AND FULL SUPPORT. THANK YOU. TOM AB NOR SAN LEANDRO. FORMER HEAD ATHLETIC TRAINER SAN DIEGO STATE AND THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU YOU. ANY OF WITNESSES THAT. OPPOSITION PLEASE COME. FOR ONE FROM A CABLE SPACE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THIS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAID CARL LUNDEN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION. I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT WITHOUT THE ANALYSIS DID A TERRIFIC JOB OF LAYING OUT THIS ISSUE ON BOTH SIDES QUITE FRANKLY -- WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE THINK IT IS OVERLY BROAD AS WRITTEN WE OF GRAVE CONCERN OVER -- THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE THIS LISTED IN THIS BILL TODAY AS IT. SETS WE ARE NOT AGAINST ATHLETIC TRAINERS BEING RECOGNIZED IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE HELPED IN THE PAST GET TWO BILLS TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. DISPEL HOWEVER GOES A LONG WAY AND FAR AFIELD. FROM WHAT TRADITIONAL ATHLETIC TRAINING HAS BEEN IN THE EDUCATION TRAIN IT SUPPORTS IT. AND I LIKE GAS SMOKE CHRIS READER GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN WHO IS BOTH AN ATHLETIC TRAINER IN A PHYSICAL THERAPIST -- TO COMMENT MORE THAT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITYTO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS CHRIS RATE GOVERNOR FAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIR OF CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION. I'M A CALIFORNIA LICENSE PHYSICAL THERAPIST AND CERTIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINER. ARISES BEGIN OPPOSITION AB FIFTEEN NINETY TWO THE PARTS OF THIS BILL HAVE COMMUNITY ARGUED THAT THERE ARE BAD ACTORS POSING AS ATHLETIC TRAINERS. AND WORKING IN CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS WHO ARE UNQUALIFIED. THE RUINS OF ALSO CONVENIENTLY USE THE ARGUMENT THAT ATHLETES ARE SAFER WHEN A CERTIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINERS ON THE SIDELINES. WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT HAVING A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL THE SIDELINES IS IMPORTANT TO THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF OUR ATHLETES HOWEVER THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ATHLETES SPORTS SPORTS TEAMS. OR SPORTS VENUES. THE BILL TALK ABOUT AUTHOR TRAINERS WORKING WITH PATIENTS FOR TREATMENT. IT CREATES A NEW BACHELOR'S LEVEL HEALTHCARE PROVIDER WITH THE FREEDOM TO WORK WITH ANY PERSON FOR NEARLY ANY CONDITION WITH ESSENTIALLY NO OVERSIGHT. FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AGO FOR LEGISLATORS STRUGGLED WITH THE CONCEPT OF LICENSING ATHLETIC TRAINERS FIGHTING PROTECTION OF THE TITLE CERTIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINER BY ALLOWING ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE A CERTIFICATION FROM THE BOARD CERTIFICATION. THE GOLD STANDARD PROSTHETIC TRAIN PROFESSION WOULD ENSURE THAT ONLY THOSE WITH THE APPROPRIATE EDUCATION TRAINING OR HOLD THEMSELVES OUT AS I THINK THERE'S A CALIFORNIA. THIS REASONABLE SOLUTION WAS RECOMMENDED BY TWO THOUSAND FIVE CALIFORNIA JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE REPORT ON AFFECT AND REGULATIONS IS ONE BY. WAS ONE PASSED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE ON THREE PRIOR OCCASIONS AS ONE SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION ON EACH OF THOSE OCCASIONS. THE ACTIVITIES DEFINED AS ASSISTING LICENSURE ARE CIRCULAR NATURE STATING THAT THE PRICE ABOUT THEIR TRAINING INCLUDES THOSE THINGS THAT QUOTE FALL WITHIN. THE PRACTICE STANDARDS ABOUT OUR TRAINING. IN QUOTE IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS. THIS ALSO ADVOCATES THE AUTHORITY OF DETERMINING WHAT ACTIVITIES FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE OF NOT THEIR TRAINER SOLELY TO THE BOARD OF CERTIFICATION. AND OR THE COMMISSION ON THE ACCREDITATION ABOUT A TRAINED EDUCATION. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS THE DUTY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF A PROFESSION TO ENSURE PUBLIC PROTECTION. IT THEREFORE SHOULD BE THE SOLE AUTHORITY IN DETERMINING WHAT ACTIVITIES FALL WITH ANY PROFESSIONS SCOPE OF PRACTICE. ADDITIONALLY THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE CONTAIN AB FIFTEEN NINETY TWO IS OVERLY BROAD IT WOULD ALLOW AN ATHLETIC TRAINER IN CALIFORNIA TO WORK WITH ANY AND ALL CLIENTS. IT DEFINES ATHLETIC ACTIVITY AS QUOTE PARTICIPATION IN EXERCISE SPORT GAME RECREATION WELLNESS FITNESS PERFORMING ARTS OR EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES THAT REQUIRES PHYSICAL STRENGTH RANGE OF MOTION FLEXIBILITY BODY AWARENESS AND CONTROL. SPEED STAMINA OR AGILITY WHICH DESCRIBES ANY AND ALL ACTIVITY PERFORMED BY ANY AND ALL PERSONS. IT IS NOT SPECIFIC TO SPORT OR ATHLETICS IN ANYWAY. THIS BROAD DEFINITION PUT PUBLIC SAFETY AT RISK BECAUSE IT ALLOWS AUTHOR TRAINERS PROVIDE CARE TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. AND NO PRE PARTICIPATION SCREEN REQUIRED. INSTEAD OF THE POPULATION FOR WHICH THEY ARE KNOWN TO TREAT ATHLETES PARTICIPATING IN ATHLETICS SETTINGS WITH A PARTICLE TAYLOR TO AN INDIVIDUAL ATHLETES SPECIFIC NEEDS. FURTHER AB NINETY AFTER AB FIFTY NAY TO CALL HER POSITION OVERSIGHT AFFLECK TRAINER THAT IS FAR MORE LENIENT THAN THAT OF OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS WHO HAVE A GREATER LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW ATHLETIC TRAINER TO TREAT A PATIENT FOR ANY INJURY OR ILLNESS OR NOT FOR AN UNRESTRICTED AMOUNT OF TIME WITHOUT THE PATIENT EVER HAPPEN TO SEE A PHYSICIAN. AS LONG AS A PHONE CALL BETWEEN THE OTHER TRAINER POSITION HAS OCCURRED AT SOME POINT TIME. THE USE OF PATIENT IN THIS CONTEXT CLEARLY PLACES THE AUTHOR TRAINER OUTSIDE OF THE SPORTS WORLD AND DELINEATES A LEVEL POSITION OVERSIGHT THAT IS VASTLY MORE LENIENT PROPER TRAINERS. WITH A BACHELOR'S LEVEL OF EDUCATION. THAN WHAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS AUTHORIZED FOR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS OR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST WITH A MASTER'S DEGREE OR FOR A PHYSICAL THERAPIST WITH A DOCTOR'S DEGREE. FINALLY WE ARE CURIOUS WHAT IS THE VOID THAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO RESOLVE. AB FIFTY NINETY TWO SIMPLY CREATES A NEW LICENSE BACHELOR'S LEVEL HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL THERE'S AUTHORIZED TO TREAT PATIENTS FOR NEARLY ANY INJURY OR ILLNESS WITH ESSENTIALLY NO OVERSIGHT BY A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER APPROPRIATE LICENSE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL. THERE ARE CURRENTLY SEVERAL LICENSE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS PHYSICAL THERAPIST PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS NURSES NURSE PRACTITIONERS OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS WHO ARE AUTHORIZED BY THE STATE TO PROVIDE THE TYPE OF CARE. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW DOCTORS BEFORE. IN EVERY CASE THE ATHLETIC TRAINER HAS A LOWER EDUCATIONAL STANDARD AND YET WOULD BE AUTHORIZED HAVE A MUCH BROADER SCOPE UNDER THIS BILL -- ONE OTHER ONE OTHER COMMENT IS WHEN AFTER TRYING TO WORK IN OTHER SETTINGS LIKE PHYSICAL THERAPY CLINICS. THERE ARE WORKING UNDER THE SUPERVISION THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF A PHYSICAL THERAPIST THEY ARE NOT WORKING AS AN ATHLETIC TRAINER USING THEIR UNIQUE SKILL SETS AS A FIVE TRAINERS THERE BEING DIRECTED IN EVERYTHING THEY DO BY THE SUPERVISING -- THAT PROVIDER. SO AS WITH PRIOR ATTEMPTS TO LICENSURE. ATHLETIC TRAINERS. AS WITH PRIOR ATTEMPTS TO LICENSE AFFLECK TRAINERS AB FIFTY NINETY TWO IS YET ANOTHER HIGHLY FLAWED BILL I STRONGLY URGE THE MEMBERS THIS COMMITTEE TO JOIN OPPOSITION. I CAST A NO VOTE TODAY. ONE MORE WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- CURTIS L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G JUNIOR WITH THE&lt;/c&gt; CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND REGISTERED NURSES IN CALIFORNIA -- WE ALIGN WITH CARL LUNDEN AND CHRIS READ HERE -- CNA OPPOSES THIS LEGISLATION -- UNLESS AMENDED WE LIKE TO SEE LANGUAGE ADOPTED -- CALLING FOR TITLE PROTECTION OF CERTIFICATION INSTEAD. A FOR CALIFORNIA ATHLETIC TRAINERS CNA BELIEVES AND PATIENT PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY AND STRONGLY AGREES THAT ATHLETES AND STUDENT ATHLETES ARE SAFER WHEN THERE'S A QUALIFIED. HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL ON THE SIDELINES DURING GAMES AND PRACTICES. HOWEVER THIS BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE PROVISIONS TO YOUR TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. INSTEAD AB FIFTEEN NINETY TO CREATE A NEW LICENSE HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WITH THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE THAT IS NOT WELL DEFINED AND EXTENDS BEYOND THE SETTING IN WHICH ATHLETIC TRAINERS. CURRENTLY PRACTICE. AND IT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS. NOW BELIEVE THAT -- I CONCUR THAT THE ANALYSIS MISMATCHES ANALYSIS REFLECTS THIS OVERLY -- BROAD NATURE AND SUPERVISION WITH IN THIS BILL. CURRENTLY ATHLETIC TRAINERS PRIMARILY WORK WITH ATHLETES IN ATHLETIC SETTING SUCH AS A SPORTS TEAM UNIVERSITY IT CETERA. IS NOT CLEAR HOW THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS AS OUTLINED IN THE CURRENT BILL. WOULD DIFFER FROM THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST OR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST -- PROFESSIONALS WERE LICENSE TO TREAT ACTIVE INDIVIDUALS IN ANY SETTING. COUPLED WITH THE LATER -- SECTION OF THE BILL DEFINING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE POSITION. AN ALLOWANCE FOR TREATMENT BY AN ATHLETIC TRAINER THE SCOPE OF THE ATHLETIC TRAINERS UNDER AB. FIFTEEN TWO WOULD ALLOW TREATMENT OF PERSONS WITH THE RANGE OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS. PROPONENTS ALSO CLAIM THAT AFTER THE TRAINERS WORK IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS WHICH IS TRUE. BUT WHAT THEY FAILED TO MENTION IS THAT THEY WORK IN THESE SETTINGS NOT AS ATHLETIC TRAINERS. AS CHRIS MENTIONED HERE BUT IN OTHER CAPACITY SUCH AS MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PHYSICAL THERAPY AIDS AND OTHER ROLES -- THE SUPERVISION AN ATHLETIC TRAINER AS OUTLINED IN THIS BILL IS NOT SUFFICIENT. AB FIFTY NINETY TWO ALLOWS ATHLETIC TRAINERS TO FOLLOW WRITTEN OR VERBAL PORTAL CALLS ESTABLISHED BY POSITION WHO NEED NOT BE PRESENT. WHILE THIS MAY BE THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS IN THE ATHLETIC SETTING WORKING WITH ATHLETES EXTENDING THIS LEVEL OF SUPERVISION. TO PERSONS OUTSIDE OF ATHLETIC SETTING IS HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC FOR US. THE CONDITIONS OF THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE AND PERMIT THE ATHLETIC TRAINER INTO ALSO ASSESS AND EVALUATE AND ATHLETES CONDITION THEN OFFER TREATMENT. WORKING BY DIRECTION OF A PROTOCOL WHEN NO POSITION AS PRESIDENT WILL EFFECTIVELY REQUIRE THE ATHLETE TRAINED TO DIAGNOSE AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONDITION TO CORRECTLY APPLIED THE CORRECT TREATMENT PROTOCOL. THE BILL YOU TO DIAGNOSE AS WELL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE AND TRAIN OF AN ATHLETIC. TRAINER -- AND THEN WHAT ANOTHER POINT AND LASTLY IS EVEN THE CURRENT WORK FIRST WORKFORCE. OF ATHLETIC TRAINERS WILL HAVE TO BE RETRAINED AND WON'T COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL IS SIGNED INTO LAW. MANY ATHLETIC TRAINERS OBTAINED THEIR CERTIFICATIONS WHEN -- WORKING ON INTERNSHIPS OR O. J. T. OR ON THE JOB TRAINING -- WHICH WAS THE STANDARD FOR ACHIEVING CERT CERTIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINERS WHO HAVE OBTAINED THEIR CERTIFICATE BY THIS METHOD SELECT THE FORMAL TRAINING VIA PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM AS OUTLINED IN THE BILL. FOR ALL THE ABOVE REASONS CNA IS OPPOSED TO AB FIFTY NINE TWO IN ITS CURRENT FORM. ACCORDINGLY RESPECT THE WE ASK FOR YOU KNOW VOTE ON A. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO UNLESS AMENDED. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME IS AN AFFILIATION MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IVAN ALL TOMORROW WITH CAPITAL ADVOCACY I'M HERE ON BEHALF THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE AMERICAN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION WE'RE IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU. A MISTER SHARON MEMBERS PAT WHALEN ELSE WILL SNACK SEE HERE ON BEHALF OF UNIACKE -- ONE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER VERY THOROUGH AND BALANCED -- ANALYSIS AND ALSO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS COMMENTS BOTH IN THE ANALYSIS AND AT THE AT THE BEGINNING OR A CITY PEOPLE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS REPEAT PROJECT THAT. THANK YOU. JANE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION -- ANY QUESTION FROM THE DAIS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN NOT A QUESTION BUT A COMMENT I TELL THIS BILL -- LAST YEAR I BELIEVE -- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I DO HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY OF ADDRESSING THEIR CONCERNS I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF LEGITIMATE CONCERNS I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SO. HOPEFULLY YOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE SAID IT BEST THAN OF I QUITE HONESTLY FIND IT AWKWARD WHEN I SEE SUCH A WONDERFUL CHAMPION OF LABOR AND OF THE NURSES. RUNNING IN CONTRAST WITH AN ISSUE THAT I KNOW HE CARES VERY DEEPLY ABOUT SO I I I SUSPECT THAT THERE'S A HAPPY MEDIUM HERE. THAT COULD BE STRUCK SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND ENCOURAGE CONTINUED DIALOGUE AND AND A POTENTIAL HAPPY MEDIUM THANK YOU -- I WILL OKAY -- MEMBER CAN KAMLAGER-DOVE. THANK YOU WILK I WAS JUST WONDERING -- I'VE. BEEN TOLD THAT THIS. HAS COME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE MULTIPLE TIMES -- IT'S PROBABLY AN ADOLESCENT BY NOW BUT I WAS WONDERING WAS THE BONTA IF YOU AND THE FOLKS SUPPORTING THIS BILL WOULD BE WILLING TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS STATED BY THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS. I THINK WAS VERY GOOD AND I TO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE AND MOST OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE SHARED BY THOSE THAT WERE -- IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT OFFERING COLLABORATIVE CARE -- AND WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS PROBABLY SO THAT EVERYONE IS STAYING IN THEIR LANE IN OFFERING THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE -- FOR THE PATIENTS OR THOSE RECEIVING -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE CARE SO CAN I WOULD. JUST LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU WERE WILLING TO RESPOND OR IF YOU WANTED TO RESPOND IN YOUR CLOTHES I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD PREFER. I AN DO EITHER BUT PASSED MY CLOTHES WOULD BE BEST. AS A MINIMUM BONTA A HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. YOUR BILL IS -- IN ESSENCE OF TRYING -- TO A CREATE. TO THE LICENSED -- AND THE REGULATIONS REGARDING -- TO ATHLETIC TRAINERS. SO TO GET THE TITLE. AS A MATTER OF A GLADIATOR TRAINER -- BY THE MORAL LAW. I THREADED TRAINING BESTSELLERS NEW ENTITY YOU HAVE TO CREATE. BUT THE I WAS CURIOUS SO WHY NOT GO UP -- WHEN NOT TESTIFY YEAR? MENTIONED THAT I'M A CERT. THE LEVY TRAINER. THERE'S NO SUCH A THING ARE IN CALIFORNIA SO FAR ALL RIGHT. NO CERTIFIED BUT SOMEBODY MENTIONED I'M CERTIFIED. THERE'S A NATIONAL CERTIFICATION NATIONAL CERTIFICATION OKAY. SO YOU USING OUR THAT THE NATIONAL STAND THE STATE CERTIFIED NOT BY CALIFORNIA. TO BUY OUT CREATING THIS -- NAM BORDER WALL. A NEW ATHLETIC. TRAINING PROGRAM HOW WILL IT THE EMPLOYEE -- THE TRAINERS QUALIFICATIONS TO WHAT ACTUAR SERVICE -- TO THE TREE A THE ATHLETICS. AT ATHLETES SO AT THIS TIME -- BECAUSE A WHAT I GATHER FROM LISTENING WITH SIZES THAT THE EVEN THE DOCTORS AND THE NURSES SO KEEP OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST SO. WHO NEED TO HELP THE INJURED THE ATHLETE'S CELL ON THE SIDELINE? THEY ARE UNDER THE CATEGORY -- FOR BROAD A TERM I FLATTENING TRAINERS. AREN'T THEY USE AS SOUTH MANY. A DREADED TRAINERS. SO -- EXCEL SO DID. THIS BILL HOW WILL IT TO UNIFY. ARE THOSE PEOPLE FIELD. HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO BECOME ATHLETIC TRAINERS SO. WAR WAR ARE THE ONES TO TRAINING TO MEAD COMMONSENSE HIS THAT APPLY TO YOUR TRAINING IS SO. HOW TO PLAY BETTER CAN IT NOT NOT THE MEDICAL STE A SUPPORT TEAM OKAY? SO IT IS A KIND OF VERY VAGUE OF WHAT DISABILITY RANKED ACCOMPLISH. AND WHAT BENEFITS THAT WOULD PUT A BRING ACTUALLY TO THE FEAR THE AND AFTER THESE. MR BONTA COULD YOU PRETTY PLEASE AND TO FURTHER THAN TO DO DURING YOUR CLOTHES YES I HAVE TO EXCUSE MYSELF A LITTLE BIT BUT I JUST WANTED TO STATE -- DAD OF ICE. HOW THE AYE RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE I FELT THIS IS ABOUT TIME? THAT WE ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR TO LICENSING AS SLICK -- UNDER THE TRAINERS I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL AND I NEED TO BE IRONED OUT AND THIS BILL WOULD BE REFERRED TO THE COMING HERE ON BUSINESS PROFESSIONS. EMMA HOPING THAT -- WOULD DIRECTORS OF OUR MEN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR NOTED THAT THE DETAIL. AND GO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WORKING WITH US AND AND AND GETTING SOME OF MEMON INTO YOUR BILL. SO IT WAS SHOT ON GOING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AND AND AND THANK YOU MISTER CHOI FOR FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. LET ME TOUCH. ME TRY TAKE A STAB AT IT STE -- TRY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW THE ATHLETIC TRAINING PROFESSION IS UNREGULATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNIQUELY SO THE ONLY STATE IN THE ENTIRE NATION THAT DOES NOT -- REGULATE OUR ATHLETIC TRAINING PROFESSION IT IT NEEDS TO BE REGULATED. I THINK MOST FOLKS WOULD AGREE WITH THAT I THINK THE THAT THE BAIT IS LARGELY AROUND SCOPE. OF PRACTICE AND AND SUPERVISION -- SO THIS WOULD CREATE A LICENSURE PROGRAM -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY WOULD BE OF A BOARD ABOUT THAT OUR TRAINERS THAT SUPERVISES WHERE THEY'LL BE REGULATIONS OVER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS RIGHT NOW ANYONE CAN HOLD HIMSELF OUT AS AN ATHLETIC TRAINER WHETHER THEY HAVE A CERTIFICATION OR NOT WHETHER THEY HAVE EDUCATION AND ATHLETIC TRAINING OR NOT. THAT'S NOT OKAY TO BE NOTHING BETWEEN -- TO HAVE THAT TITLE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE -- TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER A CERTAIN QUALITY OF CARE AND SUPPORT AND SERVICES SO THAT TO THIS BILLS SIX TO DO AND AND TO THE THE QUESTION FROM -- MISS KAMAGRA OF I'M LISTENING TO THE THE POINTS AND IN THE POINT ABOUT DIAGNOSIS AND EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES AND SCOPE OF PRACTICE AND SUPERVISION. THAT THEIR GOOD POINTS THAT REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN -- DISAGREE ARE PERHAPS BUT ALSO CAN FIND COMMON GROUND ON AND AND DIALOGUE IS DESIRED AND NEEDED. TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. AND SO ESOS LISTENING SO I'M LISTENING AND I'M AND AND I WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS THIS ISSUE IT WAS EASY BE SELF BY NOW. AND IT HASN'T AND SO IT REQUIRES US COMING TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY AND AN AREA OF COMMON GROUND WHERE WE CAN GET. REGULATIONS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR ATHLETIC TRAINER FOR THE FIRST TIME THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN A WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH APPROPRIATE SCOPE OF PRACTICE AND ALSO SUPERVISION. I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED YOU KNOW THE SCHOOL PRACTICES CAN BE DIFFICULT I KNOW THAT EACH THE PRACTICING GROUP SEES IT. MAYBE A DIFFERENT WAY THAN OTHERS BUT MY GOAL IS ALWAYS TO HAVE -- HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS PROVIDE THEIR CARE WITHIN THEIR DISCOVER THE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE AND NOT BE ON IT. THAT'S GOOD FOR PATIENTS IT'S GOOD -- FOR IT IS A GOOD WAY TO PRACTICE IS GOOD FOR A REGULATORY REGIMES SO. OB WE NOTICED MORE WORK TO DO WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT WORK -- IF WE'RE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY -- I COMMIT TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE TO IN THE WORK WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS LISTENING TO THE CONCERNS EMBRACE TODAY DOING MY BEST TO ADDRESS THEM. I THINK YOU ARE VERY MUCH A RESPECTFULLY ASK DR OUT CAN I FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION. ONE THE DEFINITION ALMOST OF LICENSURE PROGRAM IS TO SET UP ALL. ON THOUGH THAT THE BROAD TERM NOT AMONG -- ATHLETIC TRAINER AND KNOW WHO WILL BE LISTED UNDER THAT -- TERMINOLOGY -- BLOOD. IT WAS WHAT WE HAVE SOME DEFINITIONS -- IN THE BILL BOTH ATHLETIC TRAINING AND FOR ATHLETIC ACTIVITY AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE DEBATE IS IS OCCURRING RIGHTFULLY AND IN TERMS OF WHAT OTHER BRIGHT DEFINITIONAL MEETS IN BOUNDS AND BOUNDARIES. OF OF WHO WILL BE INCLUDED IN AND WHO WILL NOT SO YEAH I THINK YOU'RE ASKING APPROPRIATE QUESTION AND AT BUT IT'S A QUESTION THAT CONTINUES TO BE AN OPEN WHEN WE HAVE A STARTING POINT WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE SET FORTH OUR DEFINITIONS. IN THIS BILL FOR FOR ALL TO SEE AND REVIEW AND WE WE WE HAVE SOME CRITICISM TODAY WHICH I THINK IS FAIR FOR EXAMPLE IN UTAH THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE JUST A WOULD BE -- POTENTIALLY CATHER WHERE ISIS A TRAIN OR NOW NO NOT AT ALL. I MEAN THE BILL SPECIFIC AND SAYS THAT THE PRACTICE OF ATHLETIC TRAINING DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING I'M SORRY IF I CAN INTERRUPT MISTER CHAIR I THINK THAT WAS THE THE WITNESS THE MEMBER AUTHORS CLOSE THAT WAS MY CLOTHES ALTHOUGH I THINK.
