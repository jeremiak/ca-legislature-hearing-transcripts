AND SO I'M HERE TODAY NOT ONLY. AS A POSITION. THAT THE FAMILY MEMBER AS A FRIEND. AS A PATIENT TO. DESCRIBES YOU ISSUE THAT THOSE WHO ARE MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY ACTIVITIES WELL. TRYING ACCESS HEALTHCARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO WHAT I'M GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN. IT IS THE LACK OF ADEQUATE RESOURCES FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PENTATONIC WE WORKED WITH AN AMAZING GENIUS AS DR PAUL RYAN SAID. AND I ASKED HIM TO CREATE A MAP OF ICU BEDS IN CALIFORNIA SO WE HAD ABOUT THAT SPANS. CALIFORNIA WHEN I SEE YOU BETTER THAN I WILL FOCUSING ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SHOW. YOU WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. ANY WILL ROAD TAKE A LOOK. AT OUR MEDICAL DESERTS. WE SEE HERE THAT IN LONG BEACH THERE ARE OVER- THIS ONE SAYS ADAM WITH MILLER SCORING THIRTY AS HE LEADS. HERE. RONALD REAGAN A HUNDRED TWENTY ICU BEDS WITH FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE A LITTLE BIT IT'S. HERE YOUR SITE. NINE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX. HI THERE SEN SAID NINETY SIX. THANK YOU FOR NOW I WANTED TO COME DOWN TO. THE AREA WHERE WE ARE. WE ARE HOSPITAL. SIXTEEN HE AGE SEVENTY EIGHT. ST FRANCIS HERE IT SAYS ZERO AND A HALF. THIRTY SIX. AND WILL TAKE HOSPITAL HUNDRED THIRTY ONE BAGS TWENTY ICU BEDS. LOOK AT THE AREA. THAT DISTRICT SIXTY FOUR AND THEN. WE CAN SEE THAT WE WERE SET UP FROM THE BEGINNING TO NOT BE ABLE TO APPROPRIATELY RESPOND. TO NINETEEN. SO ISSUE IN HEALTHCARE IS ACCESS. IT IS STRUCTURE. THE ROOT CAUSE- HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES IN MY EXPERIENCE YEAH THE PATIENTS. AND AS THE PROVIDER. IT IS A CULTURE OF RACISM. AND CLASSISM. NEVERTHELESS GRADING CALIFORNIA THAT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE. UNFORTUNATELY RACISM CLASSISM IS EMBEDDED IN OUR MEDICAL EDUCATION. I PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED SAYS LAST YEAR WHEN MY MOTHER. SMALL ELECTRICIAN. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME TO OUR HOUSE. AND I TOLD THEM SHE HAD A HISTORY OF OVARIAN CANCER. SHE HAD WHAT WE CALLED BIO THAT WAS AN COMING UP IT WAS GREEN. I KNEW THAT SHE HAD A SMALL BELL STRETCHING. YES FIRE DEPARTMENT DID NOT INFORM THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS OF THIS VEHICLE IT COULD. WE WAITED OUTSIDE THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR OVER AN HOUR. I BEG THEM TO COME AND SEE MY MOTHER. THIS IS LAST YEAR. THE BUSINESS S. THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY HAD MEDICAL TRAINING. IF WE PROVIDERS OF COLOR HOW MUCH LESS OTHER OCCASIONS. WHERE SOLUTIONS. THOSE OF US WHO ARE WORKING ON THE GROUND THOSE OF US YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE TO GET AN ACCESS TO RESOURCES. WE KNOW HOW TO WORK TOGETHER WELL. WE NEED FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THIS THAT WE HAVE HERE CANNOT CONTINUE. WE NEED TO CHANGE THE EDUCATION OF OUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. AND OUR EXEMPLARY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. SO LET ME CULTURE OF RACISM CLASSISM DOES NOT CONTINUE. THIS IS CRITICAL IN ORDER FOR US TO STOP. THE CURRENTS ACROSS CITIES THAT ARE OCCURRING. IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR YOUNG IS THIRTY THREE SORRY- YOUR PRESENTATION- AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GOVERNOR SELVES AND AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH INEQUITIES- HERE IN A NON IN THE SIXTY FOURTH WHEN CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE AND SO HER PRESENTATION WAS FOCUSED ON THAT- AND SHE ALSO MADE MENTION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE MONEY IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALSO IN EDUCATION SO- WE GOT THOSE THINGS NOTED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PARTICIPATING WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO STICK AROUND.

MY MIND- BECAUSE I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT IS LARGELY UNDERSERVED IT IS RURAL AND IT IS LATINO. AND AS MY ROLE- AS CHAIR OF AGRICULTURE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY IS AS AS AS MY ROLE AS VICE CHAIR OF THE LATINO- THE CAUCUS IN THE STATE. LEGISLATURE YEP EQUITABLE HEALTH POLICY FOR OUR LATINO- ARE. COOK COMMUNITIES AND IN FACT ALL OF- OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IS A TOP- IT'S- TOP- PRIORITY FOR LEGISLATURE OF OUR STATE. ENJOY THIS COVER NINETEEN AS PANDEMIC ALL OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE UNDERSERVED- OUR- REGIONS- LOCALITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT THAT WE FACED- THAT WE WERE ALREADY FACING A CERTAINLY EXPANDED. BEYOND ANYTHING WE HAD EVER ANTICIPATED YOU TALK ABOUT EDUCATION WAS IMPACTED IN IN NEW AND SOME PROFOUND WAYS IS THE DIGITAL D. D. DIVIDED IT TORE OUR STATE APART SEPARATE THOSE WHO CAN ACCESS THEIR SCHOOL WORK. AND THOSE LIKE THE YOUNG GIRLS AND- THAT VIRTUAL PHOTO THAT WERE SITTING IN FRONT OF A TALK ABOUT TRYING TO ACCESS. THE INTERNET TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK UNFORTUNATE THAT WAS IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT IN THE SALINAS VALLEY. UP BUT YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO ECONOMIC STABILITY FOR SO MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS SO MANY OF OUR CALIFORNIANS BUT IN PARTICULAR. WE SUCH A WORKERS WORKERS IN HOSPITALITY IN AGRICULTURE AND OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT WERE HIT INCREDIBLY HARD BY THIS PANDEMIC. BUT I THINK YOU KNOW TO PUT A FINER POINT ON IT IN SO MANY WAYS ARE- LOCALITIES. ARE COMMUNITIES WERE SUFFERING ALREADY. WE WERE WOEFULLY UNPREPARED FOR THIS PANDEMIC- AND AS WE RECOVER WE CAN JUST REBUILD WHAT EXISTED PRIOR- IF WE WANT TO ACHIEVE TRUE HEALTH THE SOCIAL EQUITY FOR ALL RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE MUST MOVE FORWARD. AND I'M EXCITED BE PART OF THIS DISCUSSION AND OF- THIS COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO AGAIN PREFIX OR COMMENTS I JUST WANTED PIGGY BACK ON SOMETHING HE'S THAT HE SAID- PRIOR TO THIS PANDEMIC WE ARE READY KNEW. THAT THERE WAS- HEALTH DISPARITIES IN HEALTH IN EQUITIES- IN THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY. AND SO CERTAINLY BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC IT HAS BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT WE'VE SEEN IT- WE'VE SEEN IT FIRSTHAND IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND IT THE PURPOSE IS TO ONE EXPOSE IT EVEN ON A GRADE LEVEL. ON A STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND- AS IT RELATES TO THIS PANDEMIC OR ANY OTHER PANDEMIC MOVING FOR. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ONE WE PUT A FOCUS ON THIS WE SHINE THE LIGHT NECESSARY. TO TALK ABOUT THE INEQUITIES IN THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AND WHAT THE WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND HOW DO WE- MAKE SURE THAT WE ADEQUATELY FUND THESE COMMUNITIES. SO THAT- WE DON'T HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE DYING WHEN IT COMES OUT TO A PANDEMIC. OR MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE HYPERTENSION AND THOSE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS THAT EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT THAT IS MOST VULNERABLE TO THIS PANDEMIC AND SO. I AGAIN WANT TO THANK DR SHEILA YOUNG AND MY COLLEAGUE WHO'S THE VICE CHAIR OF THE LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS- IS HERE- WHICH I'M HAPPY TO ALSO RECORD- TO BRING UP AND ALSO- RECOMMEND AND- INTRODUCE. A DOCTOR LEBRON'S THERE ARE ALSO CORRECT ABU IS THE ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR.

I AM PORTER RICAN. I GREW UP IN SOUTH CENTRAL TO ACCESS. I AND I KNOW IN. WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE PAGE. TO PAYCHECK AS A YOUNG CHILD. I AND IT IS THESE EXPERIENCES AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH LITERATURE AND ADDS SOME LOCAL COMMUNITY ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS IN ORANGE COUNTY. THAT I'LL BE DRAWING UPON WHEN SHARING MY COMMENTS THIS MORNING. I'M SO I'M GONNA SPEAK A BIT ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ORANGE COUNTY HEALTH EQUITY COBIT NINETEEN COMMUNITY ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIP OF WHICH I'M A FOUNDING MEMBER. AT BUT FIRST I WANT TO GROUND THIS CONVERSATION IN A STRUCTURAL RACISM LANDS THEN THE BAILEY AND COLLEAGUES DEFINED STRUCTURAL RACISM AS THE TOTALITY OF WAYS IN WHICH SOCIETIES FOSTERED DISCRIMINATION THREE MUTUALLY REINFORCING SYSTEMS OF HOUSING EDUCATION. EMPLOYMENT EARNINGS BENEFITS CREDIT MEDIA HEALTH CARE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. THESE PATTERNS AND PRACTICES IN TURN REINFORCE DISCRIMINATORY BELIEFS VALUES AND DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT LENS THROUGH WHICH TO UNDERSTAND THE WORSENING OF HEALTH INEQUITIES FOR RACIALLY MINORITY HIGHEST LOW INCOME AND IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. OUR COMMUNITY ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIP DRAWS PARTICIPATION FROM COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH EQUITY ORGANIZATIONS COALITIONS AND UCI FACULTY STAFF AND STUDENTS FROM A RANGE OF DISCIPLINES. WE BELIEVE THAT BUILDING LOCAL RESILIENCE AND RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC IS NOT ABOUT BOUNCING BACK TO PRE PANDEMIC CONDITIONS RATHER IT IS ABOUT BOUNCING FORWARD TO CREATE THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY INTERVENTIONS THAT WE NEED. IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE INEQUITIES AND BUILD HEALTH EQUITY AND WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN LOCAL ACTIONS REFLECTED THIS ORIENTATION ORANGE COUNTY AND OTHER CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES WILL BE BETTER POSITIONED TO REFRAIN FROM INCREASING AND EXACERBATING HARM TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. OTHER MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM THE VIRUS AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS. AND TO SPUR AND FOSTER SOCIAL COHESION INCLUSION AND TRUST IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PANDEMIC RESPONSES IN WAYS THAT INCREASE THE POWER PARTICIPATION AND LONG TERM VITALITY OF SUCH COMMUNITIES. IN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE SEEN THAT HEALTH EQUITY HAS BEEN AN AFTERTHOUGHT AT BEST IN THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE AND LOCAL CODE NINETEEN RESPONSES. IN LINE WITH OUR POLITICAL CONTEXT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES OFTEN DISCRETION IN COVERT NINETEEN TESTING CONTACT TRACING AND VACCINATION STRATEGIES WAS LEFT UP TO LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IN CASES WHERE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH HAS A STRONG EQUITY BACKGROUND THIS APPROACH MAKES PERFECT SENSE. UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTITIONERS WOULD BE KEENLY AWARE OF LOCAL HEALTH INEQUITIES AND THE ROLES OF POLICIES SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTS IN SHAPING THESE INEQUITIES. THEY WOULD ALSO ALREADY BE WORKING IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL HEALTH EQUITY LEADERS WHO WOULD HELP THEM TO SEE EMERGING AND PERSISTENT INEQUITIES TO SHAPE THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE OUR EXPERIENCE. WE THOUGHT TESTING AND VACCINATION OPPORTUNITIES FIRST BECOME AVAILABLE TO WHITER WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES OFTEN COASTAL COMMUNITIES EVEN THOUGH THE EVIDENCE INDICATED THAT PANDEMIC RESPONSE IS NEEDED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THAT WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY CODE CASES MORBIDITY MORTALITY JOB LOSS LOSS OF HOUSING AND SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA DUE TO LOSS OF LOVED ONES. ADDITIONALLY COVERED NINETEEN VACCINES WERE FIRST MADE AVAILABLE VIA AN APP THAT WAS ONLY AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH. SO THAT RESIDENTS COULD GO TO THESE QUOTE UNQUOTE SUPER POINTS OF DISTRIBUTION. COMMUNITY HEALTH EQUITY LEADERS AND OUR PARTNERSHIP TIRELESSLY ADVOCATED FOR VACCINES TO BE DISTRIBUTED ON A SMALLER SCALE WITH WALK UP OPTIONS USING A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER OR PROMOTE THOUGHT AS MODEL. MAKING THE VACCINE AVAILABLE READILY IN RESIDENTS PRIMARY LANGUAGE VACCINE INFORMATION. AND WE URGE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH TO FIND LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS TO LEAD THIS WORK. ADDITIONALLY WE TRAINED RESIDENTS WHO LOST JOBS OR UNDEREMPLOYED DUE TO CODE RED WE TRAIN THEM AND CONTACT TRACING SKILLS THE HOPE WAS THAT THEY WOULD BE HIRED BY OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. TO INTERN CONDUCT CONTACT TRACING INSTEAD WE FOUND THAT THE CONTRACT WENT TO A FIRM ON THE EAST COAST WHO OFTEN OPERATED DURING EAST COAST HOURS AND DID NOT HAVE MANY SERVICES AVAILABLE IN RESIDENTS PRIMARY LANGUAGES. THESE ARE SOME STORIES FROM THE FIELD AND THESE ARE NOT SIMPLY STORIES THESE ARE NIGHTMARES THAT CONTINUE TO HAUNT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IN TERMS OF REDUCING COVERT INEQUITIES WE HAVE TO THINK OF THIS IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING HEALTH INEQUITIES THAT HAVE BEEN WORSENED THAT WERE EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC. AND BUILDING COMMUNITY POWER SO THAT COMMUNITIES ARE POSITIONED TO RESPOND SWIFTLY AND COHESIVELY TO THE NEXT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND TO BE GUIDED BY A HEALTH EQUITY LINES. WE HAVE BEEN IN A CYCLE WHERE JUST ABOUT EVERY THREE YEARS WE AS A GLOBAL COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN ON THE BRINK OF A MAJOR PANDEMIC. AND HISTORY TEACHES US THAT IT TAKES ABOUT THREE YEARS TO EMERGE FROM A PANDEMIC. AND KOBE TEACHES US THAT DESPITE ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH OUR SOCIETY SEATS TO SEPARATE US BASED ON RACE CLASS AND NATIONAL ORIGIN. OUR FATES ARE INTERCONNECTED SO THE PATH FORWARD IS HEALTH EQUITY. AND APART THEIR. SURE SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PATH FORWARD LOOKS LIKE- WE NEED TO REALLY BE ELEVATING THE VOICES AND PERSPECTIVES OF AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. AND JUST LIKE STRUCTURAL RACISM INVOLVES THE TOTALITY OF FORCES ARE COLLUDED EQUITY RESPONSE REALLY NEEDS TO THINK THAT ONLY ABOUT STOPPING THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS VACCINES- AND RECOVERY BUT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW COULD SHAPE HOUSING EDUCATION- AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES. AND WE NEED TO BE CARRYING AN ANTI RACISM LANDS THROUGHOUT OUR CO BAD RESPONSE- AND RECOVERY PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH TACLOBAN THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THAT AND INSIGHTFUL PRESENTATION I'M CERTAINLY IS THOUGHT PROVOKING AND YOU RAISE A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND- HOPEFULLY YOU'VE EVER STICK AROUND SO THAT WE CAN NOW FOLLOW SOME SOME QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THAT- SO AGAIN THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR INSIGHT MAX- GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE DR- ROLE HAN GONNA KISHA- PLEASE- IF YOU CAN PLEASE PRONOUNCING YOUR NAME CORRECTLY FOR ME IF FIVE OF FAILED TO DO SO AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HERE- HE'LL BE JOINING US VIRTUALLY. ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM ABLE TO SEE MY SCREEN- NOT AS OF YET DOCTOR BUT- WE THANK YOU SO NOW WE ARE WE GOT IT NOW- WEIRD THANK VERY THANKFUL HE'S DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY AND AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR PARTICIPATING WITH US- THIS MORNING IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TOPICS SO IF YOU CAN- TAKE SIX MINUTES TO INTRODUCE YOURSELVES AND MOVE RIGHT INTO YOUR PRESENTATION WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR AVAILING YOURSELF. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. RELIGIOUS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC KOKANEE LISTS IN A DISTRICT SIXTY FOUR THIRTY. MY NAME IS RANA AFICIONADO. IT IS MY HONOR TO SERVE AS A DAD I DOCTOR. ACTOR AND SHE OFFICER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR PART OF MY JOB IS TO MAKE A SLOGAN CALIFORNIA FOR ALL SLOWLY COME TO LIFE IT IS AN EQUITY AGENDA IT IS WHAT THE TESTIMONY THIS MORNING IS ALL ABOUT. WHERE WE TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. IT IS SIX MINUTES I AIM TO SHARE WHY RISK FACTORS ARE NOT PREDICTIVE FACTORS. HE HAD A PROTECTIVE FACTORS. AFTER THE SPECIAL RACISM AND CLASSISM AND DISCRIMINATION AND SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUITY IN HOUSING INCOME IN JOBS AND EDUCATION CANNOT PREDICT THE FUTURE LIKE THEY HAVE IN THE PAST WE HAVE TO LEARN TO READ AND I WAS FORWARD AND PROMOTE COMMUNITY. LET'S FIRST PETER THE OF THE RELEASE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY BEING THE COMMITTEE ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES THINK BACK TO WHEN OUR STATE WAS FOUNDED DURING THE GOLD RUSH ERA. WHEN IT HELD ONLY A PART IN A PUBLIC HEALTH WAS FIRST FOUNDED NINE OUT OF TEN CALIFORNIANS DIED OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. CHOLERA TYPHOID AND OTHER DOCTOR TO TELL YOU IT WAS INCREDIBLE. IT WAS A CONDITIONS THE SAME CONDITIONS OF CROWDED NOUS POVERTY. UNSAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENTS THAT CONTINUE TO PLAY. SOME MORE THAN OTHERS. LAST FOUR TO THAT IN OF NINETEEN EIGHTY AND WE SEE S. DIFFERENT BURKE INSERT EIGHT. LOWER LITERACY HIGHER. DENSITY WORKPLACE ARE UNEMPLOYMENT DOES IT IS VERY GOOD ACCORDING THE PROCEEDINGS THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES WILL PRESENT OUR CASE RATES AND MORTALITY. OF INFLUENZA. HISTORY WILL REPEAT ITSELF UNLESS WE ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES. SADLY NOT A LOT HAS CHANGED IN THE PAST CENTURY FAST FORWARD TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THIS IS STACEY PH DATA ON THE Y. AXIS IS THE PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DEATH RATE LIFE EXPECTANCY DROPPED BY SEVERAL YEARS IN SOME COMMUNITIES MORE THAN OTHERS. WE CONVENE THE TOP LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY IN THE MIDDLE HOUSING OVERHEAD IN THE BOTTOM POVERTY. IT AND CALLED SENATE DOES RESPONSE. I THINK INCREASE THE DOSE OF ANTI. THE RESPONSE HARM TO THE BODY IN. AS YOU INCREASE HOUSING OVERCROWDED IS IN POVERTY YOU SEE A RISE IN OVERALL DID NOT JUST COMMITTED. AND SADLY THE RIGHT YOU CAN SEE IMPACT ON RECENT. NOW OF THE SOCIALIST OF HEALTH IS NOT EQUALLY FELT ALMOST BLACK ASIANS ONE AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HAVE A POPULAR. AND WORST HIT LOBBYING OR- YOU SEE THE DIFFERENT DEATH TO ME THE WORST FORM OF INEQUITY IS DISPROPORTIONATE TO AND EQUITY DIVIDEND. BY DEFINITION IS UNFAIR UNJUST INCREMENTAL WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE TO BREAK THOSE CYCLES TO BUILD BACK STRONGER BOUNCE FORWARD AND BE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE NEXT CHALLENGE. BUT THE WORD HAD A CHALLENGE WE SEE MORE KELLY REVEALED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE GREATER FOR THE EMAILS AFRICAN AMERICANS IT IS NOT JUST RACE WE OVERLAY OTHER STRUCTURAL FACTORS IT'S A MULTIPLIER EFFECT IN GETS WORSE. PERFORMED LATINOS AN ESSENTIAL WORKING AGE TWENTY TO SIXTY FOUR WITHOUT MORE THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION TEN TIMES CODE NINETEEN DEATH RATES THAN WHITES. IN CALIFORNIA. PART OF THE HOT FOR IS TO MOVE UP. NOT DOWNSTREAM LATE IN GAME OF WE NEED ASK AND EASY YOU MAY. AT THIS POINT I BY DOC YOUNG. BUT WE TO MOVE US TO WE'RE- AND SUPPORT THOSE. HOW HE SHOULD CONNECTED CULTURE CAREGIVERS THAT. THE SAME ROOM CAUSES THAT BECAUSE REPORT DE IN THE COAL MINE IN JUNE AND. ONE WE NEED A PROGRAM. AND DOCTOR THE RAW AND THE STRUCTURAL IN ARMENIAN SYSTEMS REQUIRES P. S. C. MORE OF POLICIES. AND IN. APPROACH HERE THE BAR MODEL YOU SEE THE DATA CRITICAL I THOSE UP THROUGH LEAD CONDITION BACK THAT WE HAVE ADDRESS. WE DON'T WANT HISTORY TO REPEAT ITSELF THIS IS A POOR THE OF THE HELD A WE OVER THE PAST NINETY. HAS WORKED TO PROMOTE WELL BEING FOR ALL FORTY HEALTH. BY DOES NOT CONDITIONS TO A LITTLE INEQUITIES. WE DON'T A VARIETY OF WORK IN A LOT MORE AND TO BE. WE HIRED EMILY OSTER A AGENCY AND AT THE STATE LEVEL IN REFUSING FLOOD FEDERAL FUNDING PROMOTING A LOCAL LEVEL AS WE. WOULD NOT FALL ARE RACIAL AND WE ISSUE. RESIDUAL LIKE THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTHY INDEX TO READ IF YOU RESOURCES TO AVOID THOSE DE. THAT DOCTOR YOUNG S. DESERT BAHASA OR ANY- SIR ELTON'S DATE INCREASE MY- IT LISTS THE DIFFERENT STILL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT QUALITY AVOID JUST AND STRESS AND REALLY HELD A APPROACH ALL SECTORS COLLUDED HOTTEST ALL AGO. ALL OF RESPONSE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK A LOCAL COMMUNITY LEVEL. TRACK NOT ENOUGH THE QUALITY OF IT WILL EXPERIENCES ARE EXPRESSED. IN THOUSAND TEN BY EXECUTIVE ORDER OR SEEK HOLDEN ALL. TASK FORCE HE CAN SEE IS HER OF THE FACT IS EMBEDDED ALL THE WE ARE LEVELS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN. LOW COMMUNITIES. SO ALL BY RETURNING THE SCHOOL THAT REALLY FACTOR ON PERMITTED TO BACK. BECAUSE OF PROTECTIVE. WE HAVE TO. SAFE WORKING. IS PAID CYNICAL. C. HOUSING AND WELL IN IN A- AND COMMUNITY. SO WE GET A BALANCED FORWARD AND THE ROOT CAUSES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR ROHANI OCCASIONAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- I. I THINK YOU. YOUR PRESENTATION WAS ABSOLUTELY ON TARGET AND IT'S A COMMON THEME FOR THOSE WHO SPOKE IN PREVIOUS- THE RACIAL OVERTONES- THAT EXIST THAT WEEK IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST- THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC BUT- IT'S NOT A SURPRISE FOR THE SIMPLE FACT WE ALL KNOWING IT EXISTED BECAUSE THE LACK OF RESOURCES. BUT AGAIN THIS PANDEMIC IS BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT AND I'M GLAD WE HAVE IN THIS CONVERSATION AND THOSE THESE EXPERTS HERE IS ACTUALLY ARTICULATING THAT PARTICULAR POINT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE HOPE THAT YOU CAN ARE ABLE TO STICK AROUND FOR A FEW MOMENTS. ARE WE GOING TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND WE WOULD LOVE TO- BEGIN THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW BEFORE WE INTRODUCE OUR NEXT PANEL SO I HAVE THE FIRST QUESTION I'LL- SEE IF MY COLLEAGUE- SILVA RIVAS HAVE QUESTIONS AS WELL. BUT THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS TO EITHER- DOCTOR YOUNGER DOCTOR LAVON- AND THE QUESTION IS THIS WHAT CAN THE STATE DO BETTER FOR COMMUNITIES IN AREAS FOR THEM TO BETTER SERVE- COMMUNITIES. WHERE HEALTH DISPARITIES INEQUITIES EXIST. SO WHAT CAN IS THE DO BETTER AND SO I'D INVITE- EITHER YOU TO BE ABLE TACKLE THAT QUESTION FOURTH. I'M HAPPY TO GO FIRST. I'M SO I'M REALLY ENCOURAGED TO HEAR ABOUT THE RESOURCES THAT ARE COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE TO ADDRESS COVE ED ARE INEQUITIES AND RECOVERY. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN DISTRIBUTING THE STATE RESOURCES TO BE GREETING LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ON HOW THEY'RE APPEARING WITH RESPECT TO HEALTH EQUITY. WHEN IT IS FOUND THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE FAILING WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH EQUITY IT THEN THE STATE REALLY NEEDS TO BE THINKING ABOUT MECHANISMS OF COMMUNITY ACCOUNTABILITY. SO THAT THE RESOURCES CAN BE FUNNELED TO COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BUT LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT AN IMPORTANT BARRIER TO IMPLEMENTATION. THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND HE'S A COLOR NEED TO BE TOP OF MIND- AND SO WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT THE MULTIPLE FEEDBACK LOOPS SO CERTAINLY THAT DIRECT- HOPEFULLY SORT OF INTENDED OUTCOMES OF. THE FUNDING AND DIFFERENT POLICIES BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT FEEDBACK LOOPS AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS WELL. I AND MY HOPE IS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO STRENGTHEN EFFORTS TO WORK ALONGSIDE LOCAL GRASSROOTS INITIATIVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR YOUNG YOU WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT IF YOU'RE STILL THERE THEN I WILL GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS AND THEN WE HAVE GOT ABOUT JACK DAVIS IS JUST GETTING GOOD RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT. WHEN EDITING A EVERYTHING I EDUCATION. HOWEVER WE HAD A BLAST EDUCATION SYSTEM NEED COLLEGE. HOW NEEDS AT. THAT ARE FUND. HOWEVER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- HELLO OF OUR STUDENTS. IS RACISM IS. IN THE SCIENCES SO IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ACCESS TO EDUCATION. ESPECIALLY FOR THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS. SO THAT OUR COMMUNITIES. HELLO YEAR FRIENDS. ON THE MEASURES OF THE NATION'S. WHAT IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH MY MOTHER. WHAT IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH. MY NIECE WHO HAD INTO THE SESSION. I DIDN'T ABLE TO DIRECTLY IMPACT MY COMMUNITY MY FAMILY. BECAUSE OF THE EDUCATION I RECEIVED. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SPEECH WAS SHORT THAT MORE STUDENTS OF COLOR. THAT BLACK BROWN NATIVE AMERICANS THAT WE HAD ACCESS TO EDUCATION. THAT WE'RE NOT LOADED WITH STUDENT DEBTS THAT ARE DEBTS ARE FORGIVEN. ADD THAT OUR LOANS ARE FORGIVEN AS WELL THAT WAY WE CAN WORK IN A COMMUNITY MORE. SO IT IS IMPORTANT IN ALL OF THOSE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS TO ENSURE. THAT THERE IS ACCESS FOR THOSE. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES I WANTED TO ADD ONE MORE THING AND THAT IS THAT IS AREAS THE STATE HAS FINDING OUT HOW THE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE THE BILL HAS GONE OUT AND WE HOPE THAT WILL GO THROUGH. WE NEED TO BUILD- ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHY RIGHT. ACETAMINOPHEN LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. THAT WE DO RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. AND SO REGARDLESS OF WHO. YOU KNOW CARRIES BELIEVES OF RACISM OR CLASSISM. THE STATE HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO ASK PEOPLE MAKING DECISIONS THOSE ARE ALLOCATING FUNDING. ELIMINATE THESE DEBTORS. THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT'S WHY THIS HEARING IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMMENTS I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO NOW- MY COLLEAGUE- SO MEMBER RIVAS FOR HIS QUESTION OR COMMENT YEAH SO MY QUESTIONS AROUND STRATEGY I THINK I REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY HERE IN OUR STATE. OUR OUR OUR YOU KNOW ECONOMIC PROGRESS FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AS WE JUST HEARD ON VERGE OF BECOMING THE FOURTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD WE HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES BUT IT'S THE EFFICIENCY OF ENSURING THAT THOSE RESOURCES YOU KNOW- SERVICE- THE INTENDED PURPOSES AND THEY REACH THE RIGHT- RESIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITIES. AND I JUST ON THE LEGISLATURE THIS IS ONLY MY THIRD YEAR I AND I'VE LEARNED THAT I SEE AS VERY LARGE STATE IT'S A DIFFICULT STATE TO GOVERN IT'S A DIFFICULT STATE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND ADDRESS ISSUES EQUITABLY BECAUSE WE ARE SO LARGE GEOGRAPHICALLY WE ARE SO LARGE BY. POPULATION A LOT OF NEEDS A LOT OF- SOME DEAD AT THT DIVERSITY HERE IN OUR STATE. AND I WAS ON AN AG TOUR IN SAN FRANCISCO YESTERDAY- AND I MET WITH A COHORT- OF US PROFESSORS FROM- UC BERKELEY. ABOUT EXCESSIVE HEAT WHAT CAN WE DO AS A STATE AROUND YOU KNOW. PREVENTING ILLNESS TO THOSE ARE MOST VULNERABLE SPECIAL AG WORKERS WORK OUTSIDE. AND IMMEDIATELY AS POLICYMAKERS WE SAY HEY WE WANT TO PROTECT THESE WORKERS AND SO MY INNATE REACTION IS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO LOOK TO IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS AND THESE PROFESSORS BASICALLY SAID HEY YOU WANT TO HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON THESE WORKERS. YOU HAVE TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVING CONDITIONS- HOUSING HOMELESS CRITICAL OVERCROWDING I EXPERIENCE IN MY DISTRICT I GREW UP IN A IN IN IN FORMER HOUSING. YOU DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW ADEQUATE I WAS COOLEY SYSTEMS SO THE REASON I MENTION THAT IS BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH WHEN WE TOOK WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT HEALTH- THE DISPARITIES WERE SEEKING TO ADDRESS AND SOLVE. THEIR SO MUCH INSTABILITY WITH YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT OUR STATE ESPECIALLY FROM WAS ONE OF A RESIDENTS HOUSING INSTABILITY AND SECURITY FOOD SECURITY ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. AND SO. WHAT IS THE BEST STRATEGY IN IN. YOU KNOW IN IN IN SEEKING TO ELIMINATE THESE HEALTH- THE DISPARITIES IN IN UNDERSTANDING THESE DISPARITIES IN SEEKING TO ADDRESS IT WHAT IS THE STRATEGY AND HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR. THE DIVERSITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE- DO WE HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM STATEWIDE AND HOW DO WE ADDRESS IT IS IT A PIECEMEAL APPROACH BECAUSE WHAT WORKS WELL HERE IN THE SIXTY FOURTH MAY NOT WORK WELL IN THE FIRST DISTRICT UP NORTH OR IN MY OWN DISTRICT SO HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR THAT IS IT A REGIONAL APPROACH WE HAVE TO TAKE IS A STATE. YOU KNOW- IS A STATEWIDE APPROACH. SO OFTEN ALONG WITH A QUESTION. SO DOES ANYONE WANTS TO TAKE A STAB AT THAT BEFORE WE GO TO DOCTOR DAVIS. I'VE HAD- THANK YOU FOR THAT REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE ANSWER IS A BOTH HANDS AT THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE BUILDING UP STATEWIDE COALITIONS TO BE ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS WHETHER IT COMES TO COVERT RECOVERY TO CLIMATE RESILIENCE. WHATEVER THE EQUITY ISSUE IS OF OUR TIME AND WE ALSO NEED TO BE INVESTING IN- LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS TO BE DEFINING COVERT RECOVERY PLANS- AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE PLANS. AT WE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THESE ARE STRATEGIES THAT ARE DESIGNED BY THOSE WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED BY THESE ISSUES OF COVERT INJUSTICES CLIMATE INJUSTICES. AND OFTEN- WIDE SOCIAL MOVEMENT LEADERS TEACH US IS THAT WHEN AFFECTED COMMUNITY LEADERS MEMBERS ARE DESIGNING THESE PLANS THEY BOTH- YIELD INSIGHTS INTO HOW WE NEED TO CHANGE CURRENT SYSTEMS TO OPERATE MORE EQUITABLY. AND THEY ALSO PRODUCE- RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW SYSTEMS THAT ARE NEEDED BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEMS ARE FAILING LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND THOSE SAME COMMUNITIES HAVE THE TOOLS AND SOLUTIONS AT HAND AND WE NEED TO BE FUNDING THEM ROBUSTLY TO BE DEVELOPING NOT. THANK DOCTOR ARE RUSH ARK KITCHENER I THINK YOU WANTED TO COMMENT. THAT ARE HEARD YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT WE SAW FROM DOCTOR YOUNG THE GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS WHERE THERE'S BEEN LESS RESOURCES AND POWER IN DECISION MAKING OVER TIME THAT'S LED TO THAT DESERT YOU BEDS- DEBTORS DEBTORS AND OTHER RESOURCES. AND SIMILARLY WE DO HAVE TOOLS IN PLACE TO HOT SPOT ARADIA FULL CONCERNS HEALTHY LEAD AFTER THE MEETING THAT WE USED TO GET DOWN TO THE CENSUS TRACT LEVEL IN NEIGHBORHOODS TO ADDRESS THOSE CONDITIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RITA SPOKE ABOUT AND WE CAN USE THOSE FOR COMMON RISKS FOR ALL. ETERNITY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIFTED MISSION. FOR EXTREME HEAT DAYS THAT ARE PROJECTED INTO THE FUTURE WE USE THIS TOOL. BILLION DOLLARS STATE GRANT FUNDING TO GET THEM TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THEM THE MOST AGAIN TO BOLSTER THE PROTECTIVE. IS TO BE PAIRED WITH LOCAL EXPERTISE FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS AND LIMITATION. I ALSO WANT. SURE YES DOCTOR WHEN I AGREE A 100% WITH WHAT WAS JUST SAID AND THE LIMITING FACTOR THAT WE ALWAYS HAD IT THANK. WE DON'T NEED MORE RESEARCH WE KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND WE DON'T HAVE FUNDING. IF WE HOW THE FUNDING WE CAN GET THINGS GOING AND REALLY DO THE WORK TO ELIMINATE THESE HEALTH DISPARITIES. YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT REALLY GOES TO- AGAIN ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROBERT RIVAS AND TWENTY THREE OTHERS INCLUDING MYSELF AS WE AUTHORED A BIPARTISAN LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR REGARDING THE CALIFORNIA- HEALTH EQUITY RACIAL JUSTICE BOND- TO TALK ABOUT AND PUT RESOURCES- TARGETING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BUT ALSO I OFTEN. EIGHT THAT SPECIFICALLY WOULD HAVE EMPOWERED RESOURCES- CLINICS- TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN THIS BILL WOULD HAVE FOCUSED ON- HOUSING OF FOOD INSECURITIES AS OF THE STILL A MEMBER INDICATED EMPLOYMENT INSTABILITIES UNDER RESOURCE SCHOOLS AND ALSO CHILD CARE AND ALSO COMMUNITY VIOLENCE IS ALSO ONE AND HATE CRIMES AND ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE AND SO I THINK WE'RE ON TO SOMETHING I THINK THIS WE JUST NEED TO ONE. COME AROUND AND COLLABORATE ON HOW TO MOVE THIS FORWARD TO GET THE KIND OF RESOURCE THAT CONTAINER HERE THEY RESOURCES CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE. IN OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. I REMEMBER RIVAS YEAH IF I COULD ADD SOMETHING REALLY QUICKLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS VICE CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS WE DEALT WITH A LOT OF THESE ISSUES- ESPECIALLY LAST YEAR- AMID THE PANDEMIC. AND I AGREE WITH WHAT HAS BEEN SAID AS FAR AS THE APPROACH. YOU KNOW- WE HAVE A GOOD ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBLEM. FUNDING IS KEY. AB ONE FUNDING WAS MADE AVAILABLE. YOU KNOW FOR CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE STATE. OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AGREED OR- THEY DISAGREED I GUESS I SHOULD SAY WITH THE PROBLEMS AND ISSUES. THEY DIDN'T USE THOSE FINDINGS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS AND THEY JUST EXACERBATED THESE- HEALTH DISPARITIES AS WE KNOW IT. R. AS WE KNOW THEM AND SO I GUESS YOU KNOW KEEP THAT IN MIND AS FAR AS HOW DO WE OVERCOME THAT TO WHERE. PEOPLE ON OUR YOU KNOW SOME RESIDENTS AND OUR STATES AND- IN SOME PARTS OF OUR STATE. YOU KNOW THERE'S A GOOD STRUCTURE GOOD FOUNDATION BUT IN OTHER PARTS- THEY'LL BE LEFT BEHIND AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO REALLY ELIMINATE THESE DISPARITIES. ACROSS THE BOARD STATEWIDE ESPECIALLY THOSE REGIONS THAT NEED IT MOST YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DEVELOP A YOU KNOW A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY ON HOW WE OVERCOME. I WANT TO BRING I WANT TO BRING IN- THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR DAVIS FOR BEING SO PATIENT. OF DOCTOR DAVIS WHO IS A HEALTH OFFICER OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- PLEASE TAKE A FEW MOMENTS IT INDUCES SELF AND ALSO- IN LIGHT AS IF YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE. O. K. NO DOCTOR DAVIS. THEY WILL ACT GET HIM SOON. SO AGAIN IS THE COMMON THEME HAS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN AND WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL- IS IT RESOURCES AND I THINK THAT- WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DONE WITH THE LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- AND I THINK ALL OF YOU HELP CAN HELP PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN MAKING SURE THAT WHEN WE GET THOSE RESOURCES BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT I DON'T WANT IS HAVE MEETINGS TO HAVE MEETINGS HERE ARE SELF TAUGHT. WE DON'T NEED TO DO FURTHER RESEARCH WE ALREADY KNOW WHERE THE ISSUES ARE- WE CAN PULL THEM UP BY ZIP CODES ARE AREAS AND NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN IT WILL ABSOLUTELY DRIVE- AND SHOW COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- WITH THE HELP DISPARITIES WHETHER IT'S HYPERTENSION DIABETES THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AN AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINOS HAS BEEN ON A LIST DAM AND I'M READY FOR US TO BE OFF THAT LIST. AND REALLY GET RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN TURN AND RIDE NEW NARRATIVE- FOR ARE NOT ONLY ARE GENERATIONS BUT OUR OUR OUR PARENTS AND OTHER ELDERS IN OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY CAN LIVE A LONG PROSPEROUS LIFE IT SHOULD NOT BE WHERE IS CHRONICLED INTO THE DATA WHERE DO YOU LIVE IN ONE SEGMENT OF LOS ANGELES LIKE SAY THE EAST SIDE. THAT YOUR MORTALITY RATE IS DIFFERENT AND LESS THAN IT WOULD BE ON THE WEST SIDE OF LOS ANGELES AND WE HAVE THE DRESS THAT THAT'S THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM AND WE NEED A PLAN IN ORDER pPARTICULAR POINT SO DURING OUR FIRST PANEL- WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE CAUSES EFFECTS OF HEALTH- INEQUALITIES AND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED- ON THE STATE AND COUNTY LEVEL NOW WE WILL TURN TO THE HEART. OF OUR COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING CLINICS AND TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS EACH ORGANIZATION WILL DESCRIBE HOW THEY ADDRESS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN THEIR WORK IN ORDER TO PROMOTE- HEALTH EQUITY AND SO IT'S KIND OF WOULD HAVE UP TO SIX MINUTES AND PLEASE THE NO SIX MINUTES TO COMPLETE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND THEN. PROCEED WITH THE PRESENTATION. AS SO I GIVE A GREAT TO- OFF- MISTER CARLOS TORRES- WHO IS EXECUTIVE. LGBT Q. LONG BEACH CENTER WHO IS HERE PHYSICALLY IN THE ROOM THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US HERE CALCI DIVERSITY BECAUSE HILLS. AND WELCOME AND PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND PERCY. GOOD MORNING- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON AND REVERSED THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING- IT IS. I'M HUMBLED BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE BEFORE YOU TODAY AND I TRULY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THIS AND A SOFT OFTENTIMES IN SKIT- FOCUS IN SACRAMENTO AND SO I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOU COMING. TO OUR COMMUNITIES TO LISTEN TO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY. MY NAME IS CARL STORIES ARE YOU SEE HIM PRONOUNS AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LGBTQ CENTER LONG BEACH- THE CENTER HAS BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT FORTY YEARS. AND WE REALLY ARE BECAUSE ON COMMUNITY SERVICE OR SERVE IN OUR COMMUNITY. I'M SADDENED TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY I WILL BE DOING SOME REPEATING OF- TWO ONE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY BROUGHT ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF HEALTH EQUITY- ITS FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT- SERVICE THAT SERVES AS DR YOUNG. SHARE WITH US EARLIER WHICH IN OUR REGION THEY ARE S- DEMONSTRATED BY THE MAPS THAT WERE SHARED WITH US EARLIER YES IT IS. A HUGE GAP RIGHT IN IN. ADEQUATE WELCOMING SAFE- SERVICES FOR OUR COMMUNITY SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING BUT AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING ABOUT MARKET RATE HOUSING. BECAUSE THOSE MARKET RATE OPTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO WE HAVE TO. BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT HOW THOSE RESOURCES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES ARE ALLOCATED. SO WE HAD TO BE INTENTIONAL ON WE HAVE TO BE PURPOSEFUL ABOUT. HOW THE RESOURCES ARE BROUGHT ABOUT AND WHO GETS ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES S. IT WAS BROUGHT UP BY. DR LEBRON EARLIER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOOD INSECURITY. RIGHT AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEALTHY FOODS NOT FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS HEALTHY FOODS. HEALTHY FOODS NOT FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS. RIGHT SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DATA FOR WILL HOUSING WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS WITHIN NEIGHBORHOODS OF OPPORTUNITY I NEVER HEARD OF OPPORTUNITY AT THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE. GROCERY STORES. ARMOS SEES EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDABLE DAYCARE SAFE ROADS ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON SO AGAIN WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL JUST BUILDING HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEXT TO A LAN FIELD IS NOT ACCEPTABLE OTHER PIECE OF COURSE IS EMPLOYMENT STABILITY. UNFORTUNATELY ALL THESE FACTORS AT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WHICH OF COURSE HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP BUT FROM OUR LANDS AS- AND LGBTQ COMMUNITY SPACE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THESE AREAS. BRING ABOUT ELAN'S OF SAFETY. WELCOMING AND ACCEPTANCE WE CANNOT. HE EXPECTED TO NOT BE OURSELVES WHEN WE WALK WORK EXCUSE ME WALK INTO A PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT. WE CANNOT. AFFORD NOT TO BE OURSELVES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE WE LIVE WE CANNOT AFFORD NOT TO BE OURSELVES WHEN WE ACCESS HEALTH CARE SERVICES. RIGHT SO AGAIN I GO BACK TO THE PEACE WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL HOW DO WE LEVERAGE THE KNOWLEDGE THE EXPERTISE AND THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE TRYING TO IMPACT. WE ARE INTENTIONAL ABOUT FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES ORIENTATION ABOUT LEGISLATION WERE INTENTIONAL ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS AND WE'RE INTENTIONAL ABOUT OUTCOMES. THAT'S HOW WE BEGIN TO CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE. AGAIN I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES WOULD ANY RESEARCH THERE'S PLENTY OF RESEARCH WE KNOW THERE SERVE WHERE THIS IS AT THE SERVICES ARE. NOT LET'S GET TO WORK LESS ENGAGE- AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID EARLIER LISTING GAUGE THOSE COMMUNITY PARTNERS LESS ENGAGE THIS COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT HAD THE LIVED EXPERIENCE THAT HAVE THE HISTORY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE UPS AND THE DOWNS IN THE VALLEYS OF EQUALITIES RACISM SEXISM XENOPHOBIA HOMOPHOBIA ALL OF IT HEALTH EQUITY AND AN INFECTIOUS DISEASES SUCH GIVING FOR A MOMENT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE LATEST PUBLICATION FROM THE LONG BEACH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH STATES THAT IN LONG BEACH. I RATES OF HIV. RATE OF HIV OUR DOUBLE THE RATE OF HIV AT THE STATE LEVEL. DOUBLE AND I DON'T NEED TO TELL HIS AUDIENCE BUT IF YOU WERE TO GUESS. BLACK LATINO. YOUNG MEN ARE THE PRIMARY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INFECTED WITH HIV. SO WHAT CAN WE DO. AGAIN WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL WE HAVE TO BE PURPOSEFUL. WHEN THOSE RESOURCES AND I KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN WE PRINT ADDRESS THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED. THOSE RESOURCES BECOME LIMITED WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT HOW WE ALLOCATE THOSE RESOURCES AND SHARE THOSE RESOURCES TO THE COMMUNITY THE OTHER PIECE THAT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU IS- AS A STATE. AND THIS IS A NATIONWIDE PROBLEM BUT AS A STATE WE LACKED THE ABILITY WHEN WE ARE PROVIDING. MEDICAL SERVICES TO OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST LGBT BUT OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY OUR SYSTEMS LACK. THE ABILITY. FOR US. TO BE OUR TRUE SELVES WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT MOST IN MOST HEALTH CARE SETTINGS THEY ASK YOU FOR YOUR- GIVEN NAME. WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE NAME THAT I GO BACK TODAY. THEY ASK YOU YOUR GENDER BIRTH WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE THAT THE VENDOR BOOK WHICH IDENTIFY. RIGHT IN MOST HEALTH CARE SETTINGS THEY ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR WIFE OR HUSBAND. MOST HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. IT'S NOT SAFE FOR ME TO BE MYSELF. BECAUSE EITHER PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME PEOPLE HAVE AN ACCENT LIKE I DO PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE SAME COLORS CAN. AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND ON. SO AGAIN WE NEED TO BE INTENTIONAL WE NEED TO BE PERSONAL PROPOSAL AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE FINAL OUTCOME WHAT DO WE WANT THE INTERVENTION THAT MEDICAL INTERVENTION IT WE'RE TALKING A MEDICALLY SPECIFICALLY. WHETHER WE WIN THE AKRON OF THE MEDICAL INTERVENTION TO BE HE SAID JUST TO GIVE YOU A BANDAID AND SAY. YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT COVERED. WELL THIS IS NOT- SOMETHING RELATED TO ANOTHER MEDICAL ISSUE. GO HOME BECAUSE I KNOW BETTER THAN YOU DO. NOW WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL AND WE HAVE TO BE PURPOSEFUL ABOUT WHAT WE DO AND I DO APPRECIATE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- GIPSON REVERSE FOR THE LETTER- AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE. WHO WROTE THE LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR BUT I WOULD- YOU KNOW ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT. INTENTIONALITY AND IMPACT S. THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THEIR RESOURCES BECAUSE AGAIN LIKE- YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER REAL ESTATE WHAT WORKS IN ONE AREA OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK IN A DIFFERENT AREA BUT WE LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE THE KNOWLEDGE LIVE EXPERIENCES OF THE COMMUNITIES WE TRYING TO. AFFECT IT WILL HAVE A MUCH BETTER DESIRE. UNLESS UP THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE IT. AND I WILL WHEN IT'S TIME TO ASK QUESTIONS I WANT TO PUT THIS ON YOUR MIND ARE WE ASKING FOR TOO MUCH ARE WE ASKING FOR ON THINGS THAT ON A REASONABLE FOR OUR COMMUNITY SO MUCH OF PONDERED OVER THAT WELL WE GO TO OUR- STUDENTS OUR NEXT PRESENTER- OUR NEXT PRESENTERS TERRY SMITH WHO IS THE DIRECTOR. OF HIV PREVENTION SERVICES AT A. P. LA. HEALTH WHO'S WITH US PHYSICALLY SO TERRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE IF YOU CAN YOU HAVE UP TO SIX MINUTES AGO PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND THEN PROCEED WITH YOUR PRESENTATION AND HAPPY THAT YOU JOIN US THIS MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS TERRY SMITH I AM DIRECTOR OF SEXUAL HEALTH AND HIV PREVENTION SERVICES. A. P. LA HEALTH. ON I THINK TO KIND OF BEGAN. TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE APLE HEALTH IS COMMITTED TO NASA'S MISSION TO PROVIDE QUALITY CARE FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY. I THINK WE TALK ABOUT HEALTH DISPARITIES. IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE A CONTEXT ARE LISTED A WONDERFUL JOB OF LAYING OUT. ON THE IMPACT OF HIV IN OUR COMMUNITY NOT JUST ONE UNDERSCORE FROM THINGS I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. L. A. COUNTY MAKES UP TWENTY FIVE POINT 2% OF THE POPULATION THE STATE. IT HAS THIRTY FOUR POINT MOST COMMON MEANS OF TRANSMISSION IS MEN WITH SEX WITH MEN EIGHTY ONE PERCENT. 50% OF THESE DIAGNOSIS WERE AMONG LATINO MSM 20% WHITE 21% BLACK AND 5% APR. BLACKS MAKE UP 21% OF NEW HIV CASES IN L. A. COUNTY IN SPITE OF BEING A PERCENT OF POPULATION. IT IS JUST M THE TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS MAKE UP QUITE ONE THE TWENTY POINT 5% OF THE TOTAL PACKAGE L. A. COUNTY YET THEY MAKE UP 2% OF NEW HIV POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND HIV CONTINUES TO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT YOUNG GAY BISEXUAL MEN OF COLOR. ALONG WITH HIV WE ARE TALK ABOUT STDS AS WELL BECAUSE WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN STD EPIDEMIC THAT'S OUT OF CONTROL WITH UNFORTUNATE ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE ARE NOW IN A TIME WHERE WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO END HIV EPIDEMIC. AS WELL AS A FEW DIFFERENT IMAGE WE GET WE DON'T AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS. A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO ALREADY IMPACTED BY RACIAL ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION. UNDERSCORE CARLOS'S POINT THEY'RE BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY WHO THEY ARE AND WHO THEY LOVE. AND THIS LACK OF ACCESS TO CULTURALLY RELEVANT SERVICES AND SO I THINK THE LUCIANS REALLY ARE ABOUT PROVIDING RESOURCES TO EXISTING CBO TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE COMMUNITIES. TO EXPAND THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES. I THINK ALSO FOR ANYONE WHO PROVIDING SERVICES ARE FUNDED BY THE STATE THE RELEASE BE CLOSELY COPSEY TRAINING ON TERMS OF HOW TO DEAL WITH LGBTQ FOLKS BECAUSE IT IS A SPECIAL. TYPE OF THING AND ALL YOU NEED IS SOMEONE TO GO INTO A SPACE WHERE THEY TRY TO GET SERVICES. AND THEY ARE THEIR INCOMING SOME NONSENSE AROUND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE I DON'T GET TO PRO NOW YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE THIS AND ALL THAT RIGHT IT'S ABOUT PROVIDING SERVICES. WE TO ADDRESS HIV STIGMA BECAUSE IT IS STILL REAL THAT KEEP PEOPLE FROM ACCESSING SERVICES. WE ALSO NEED TO ADDRESS HOMOPHOBIA TRANSPHOBIA COULD AGAIN THOSE ARE THINGS THAT PERPETUATE AND KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF SERVICES AND NOT JUST THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE FOR FOLKS IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY SINCE WITH A REAL HARD CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT. WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT FOLKS HAVE ACCESS TO SOCIAL SERVICES IN THEIR COMMUNITY INCREASE FUNDING FOR STD SERVICES BECAUSE STD SERVICES AND CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN WOEFULLY UNFUNDED FOR YEARS. AND THEN ENSURE THAT PROVIDERS A SEXUAL SERVICES FUND TALK ABOUT HIV TESTING STD. SCREENING AND TREATMENT PREP AND PAP X. THE GET TO CARE FOR P. WHO ARE A- POSITIVE. THE BILL. ARE ALSO- IN A NEW RIGHT. NOT JUST. HOURS RIGHT SO. A CRACK OPEN A TO FIVE IS NOT SERVING THE COMMUNITY. A CLICK OF OPEN TO FOR. IS NOT SERVING THE CAN PEOPLE WORKING HAVE LIVES OR WHATEVER IT'S A REALLY BEGINNING TO PUT- SPACES WERE OUR COMMUNICATIVE AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AT TIMES THAT ARE CONVENIENT TO THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH- AND WE GET TO THE QUESTIONS- SEGMENT OF A PHOTO TO DR DAVID DOCTOR DAVIS YOU WITH US- EIGHT WANT TO PUT ON YOUR MIND- MISTER SMITH IS- WHICH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT GETTING TO ZERO AND NOW WE CAN GET A ZERO BASED ON THE STATISTICS YOU TO SHARE WITH US SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE- BECAUSE WE'RE ALL PUSHING THE CAMPAIGN GETTING TO ZERO I WAS PART OF IT.

THE IT'S ABSOLUTELY. THAT WE MAKE THAT IN WE THESE CAN. WE HAVE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE I WAS VERY. THOSE REPRESENTING INDIAN TRIBES TO BEING PART OF THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE LOOK AT THE PEOPLE BEING DISENFRANCHISED CERTAINLY- THEY ARE IN THAT SAME CATEGORY SO THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR AVAILING YOURSELF. I WANT TO GO NOW TO MISSOURI AND A PREVIOUS DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENTAL AND EXTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR THE COMMUNITY CLINIC ASSOCIATION OF LOS AGELES COUNTY THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US HE'S WITH US- PHYSICALLY AND PRECIADO YOUR TIME. WITH US AND LOOK FORWARD TO- YOUR PRESENTATION SO PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE IN SUCH ESTEEMED COMPANY INCLUDING A COUPLE OF OUR MEMBER COMMUNITY CLINICS AND HEALTH CENTERS HERE ON THE PANEL WITH ME- SO AGAIN MY NAME IS TO INCREASE I AM THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AND EXTERNAL AFFAIRS. AT THE COMMUNITY CLINIC ASSOCIATION OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WE ARE A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION WE REPRESENT SIXTY FOUR NONPROFIT COMMUNITY CLINIC AND HEALTH CENTER ORGANIZATIONS. OPERATE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SITES ALL ACROSS L. A. COUNTY SO LANCASTER DOWN THE LONG BEACH WAY OUT EAST YOU NAME IT- SERVING OVER ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION PATIENTS HERE IN L. A. COUNTY ANNUALLY- AND THAT'S AT LAST COUNT. SEE WHAT THE DATA SHOWS NEXT TIME AROUND- SO I WAS YOU KNOW ASKED TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE MAIN HEALTH DISPARITIES- ISSUES CAUSING YOU KNOW HEALTH INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES AND IN A CLINIC SETTING AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE FOUR. PANELISTS TODAY HAVE REALLY TOUCHED ON. PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW THE LAUNDRY LIST OF THINGS WE'RE SEEING IN THE CLINIC SETTING RIGHT I MEAN-WE ALL KNOW THESE THINGS ARE IMPACTING OUR PATIENTS. FROM POVERTY TO RACISM EDUCATION WE'VE GOT JOB INSECURITY LACK OF JOB STABILITY- AND ADEQUATE WAGES. FOOD AND SECURITY I MEAN THE LIST GOES ON AND ON RIGHT ON HOUSING IS A BIG ONE- LACK OF HOUSING OVERCROWDED HOUSING- TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES AND THEN I WAS MENTIONED EARLIER ON WHAT WE SAW REALLY DRIVEN HOME BY THE PANDEMIC DIGITAL INEQUITY. TURNS OUT TO HAVE BEEN A FAR BIGGER ISSUE PERHAPS THAN WE THOUGHT IT WAS. I'M IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC- ALSO MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY I THINK ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WEIGHING IN AND IMPACTING PATIENTS OR BY CLINICS ACROSS L. A. COUNTY- YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT. POLLUTION WE'VE GOT DRILLING WE'VE GOTTEN. THAT WILL SCHOOLS REALLY AREN'T ORANGE COUNTY WE'VE GOT DRILLING WE'VE GOT PORTS AND FREEWAYS WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW IMPACTING KIDS AND ASTHMA- SO YOU NAME IT THE CLINICS SEE IT AS FAR AS- SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH INEQUITIES- FEW OF USER DATA JUST TO SHARE WITH YOU JUST TO PAINT A PICTURE OF WHO CLINICS. ARE AND WHO THEY SERVE IN L. A. COUNTY- 92% OF CLINIC PATIENTS AND CALIFORNIA HEALTH CENTERS ARE NON WHITE SO I. HI TO DIG FOR THAT DATE OF HERE FOR L. A. COUNTY COULDN'T UNDER THAT BUT WHITE AND THAT IS THE PATIENTS CLINICS ARE SERVING. IN L. A. COUNTY JUST PAINTING A PICTURE OF THE POVERTY LEVEL IN THE REALITY OF OUR PATIENTS ECONOMIC SITUATIONS. 77% OF CLINIC PATIENTS. HOUSEHOLD INCOME UNDER LEVEL- 90% OF THE PATIENTS SERVED BY CLINICS IN L. A. COUNTY ARE EITHER UNINSURED. OR ON MEDICAID. AND CLINICS IN L. A. COUNTY AT LAST COUNT SERVING ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PATIENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS EACH YEAR- SO THE NUMBERS REALLY SPEAK TO WHO THE CLINICS ARE AND WHO THEY'RE SERVING- AND THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS ON. ON THE HEALTH OF PATIENTS IN THE LIFE EXPERIENCE OF PATIENTS I THINK. GOES ON SAID TO THIS AUDIENCE- HOPE IT REALLY DROVE HOME THE INEQUITIES ARE COMMUNITIES WERE FACING I THINK IT BECAME READILY APPARENT VERY EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC- JUST WHAT THE SITUATION WAS. AND I WILL SHARE THE STORY THAT THAT WE FACED EARLY ON YOU KNOW. AND IT IT REPEATED ITSELF A COUPLE TIMES BUT WE ARE IN A BETTER SITUATION NOW AND THAT WAS WHEN YOU KNOW THE CODE FIRST HIT AND WE WERE TRYING TO GET TESTING SUPPLIES INTO CALL THE CLINIC SETTING- AND STARTED BECOME APPARENT WHICH COMMUNITIES WERE THE HARDEST HIT BY. COVERT NINETEEN REALLY HAVING TO SAY HEY YOU LIKE. CLINICS ARE IN THESE COMMUNITIES THESE ARE PATIENTS THAT ARE BEING THE HARDEST HIT AND- HOW CAN WE GET THE TESTING SUPPLIES THE FLOW TO CLINICS LIKE HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THIS CAPABILITY IN THE CLINIC SETTING. SIMILAR PLAYED OUT AGAIN WHEN VACCINES BECOME AVAILABLE AND WE WERE HAVING SAY NEED TO DISTRIBUTE VACCINES TO THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES- I'M REALLY HAVING TO PUSH HARD TO GET THAT TO HAPPEN- BUT I'M HARD TO SAY THAT WE'RE IN A MUCH BETTER SITUATION- OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH L. A. COUNTY DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WE ARE FORTUNATE COUNTY I THINK TO THE REMARKS MADE EARLIER THAT. NOT EVERY COUNTY WORKS REALLY CLOSELY WITH THEIR CEOS AND WITH THE CLINICS AND THEIR LOVE JURISDICTION. HERE IN L. A. COUNTY OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PH IS PRETTY STRONG THESE DAYS- I KNOW THEY PARTNER VERY CLOSELY WITH A LOT OF THE CLINICS ARE DOING THE WORK ON THE GROUND WITH A GUARD TO VACCINATION. THEY THEY COME KNOCKING WE SEE EMAILS FLUTTER IN BOX YOU DON'T WHEN BOOSTERS ARE APPROVED IT'S OKAY HOW CAN WE GET CLINICS INVOLVED HOW CAN WE ENGAGE THE CLINICS IN THIS WORK. THE LATEST CONVERSATIONS AROUND CODE THERAPEUTICAL AND THEY REALLY DO RECOGNIZE. HOW DO WE GET THIS INTO THE HANDS OF CLINICS HOW DO WE GET THIS AVAILABLE TO CLINICS TO DISTRIBUTE TO THEIR PATIENTS THAT RECOGNITION THAT THE CLINICS ARE. IN THE VERY COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN THE HARDEST HIT I MEAN. PHYSICALLY THINKING ABOUT HEALTH IMPACTS BUT ALSO ECONOMICALLY BY THE PANDEMIC- WE ONCE TOOK A MAP ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IT- WE DID SHARE A PRETTY WIDELY LAST YEAR. EARLY ON MORE WE LAYERED. THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES LIKE OVER NINETEEN ON TOP OF A MAP OF WHERE COMMUNITY CLINICS AND HEALTH CENTERS ARE LOCATED IN L. A. COUNTY. AND THAT MAPS ALMOST IDENTICALLY I'M JUST REALLY SPEAKING TO WE ARE IN THESE COMMUNITIES THIS IS WHERE CLINICS ARE. I'M THINKING ABOUT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH- VERY GRATEFUL TO SEE THE MATERIALS FOR THIS HEARING JUST THAT RECOGNITION THAT WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT RESOURCES AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN SPOKEN TO BY A LOT OF THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS- JUST HOW ESSENTIAL THAT. IS WE DO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT TEN THIRTY EIGHT AM WHICH WOULD HAVE. A GROUP GRANTS TO ENTITIES LIKE COMMUNITY CLINICS- VERY POSITIVE AND THE FUND THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING EARLIER AGAIN VERY POSITIVE STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- PROBABLY. YOU KNOW SOMETHING I WANTED TO FLAG IS JUST HOW WIDELY VARIED CLINICS ARE- YOU SEE TWO OF THEM HERE TODAY AND THEY SERVE DIFFERENT PATIENTS HAVE DIFFERENT FOCUSES DIFFERENT POPULATIONS THEY WORK WITH- CLINICS PROVIDE A WIDE VARIETY OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO HELP MITIGATE TO HELP. ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WHETHER YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. FOOD PANTRIES IN ROMAN INTO CALFRESH- HOUSING NAVIGATION. THERE'S A LONG LONG LAUNDRY LIST YOU'RE YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE SOUTH LA CLINIC THAT HAS A PROGRAM TO HELP PATIENTS ADDRESS HOUSING ISSUES PROVIDING LEGAL SUPPORT- WE'VE GOT A PATIENT A CLINIC ON SKID ROW TAT'S HELPING PATIENTS WITH MEDICATIONS STORAGE JUST THE LITTLE THINGS TO TRY TO HELP. PATIENTS ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE LARGER THINGS IN THEIR LIFE THAT ARE IMPACTING THEIR HEALTH- I FLAG THAT ISN'T THINKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS OF COURSE WE MENTIONED RESOURCES BUT I WILL FLAG FLEXIBILITY AND RESOURCES- THAT NEED FOR CLINICS TO BE ABLE TO. TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST TO DO WHAT WILL MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES AND THE PATIENTS THEY SERVE- THAT IT'S NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES- I DO THINK THAT THE FLAG WORTH MAKING. CLINICS ARE TAKING SOME STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION ALREADY WERE. WORKING WITH DHS TO ADJUST THE WAY CLINICS ARE PAID- WHICH WILL PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND ALLOW CLINICS TO USE DIFFERENT PROVIDERS PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL WRAPAROUND TYPE SERVICES- SO THAT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT MAINTAINING TELEHEALTH IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT FLAG ON SO MAINTAINING THE ABILITY OF CLINICS- MAINTAIN THE ABILITY OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS TO CONTINUE UTILIZING TELEHEALTH ACCESS CARE- SO MANY POTENTIAL BARRIERS THAT THAT CAN OVERCOME WHICH WE SAW DURING THE WHOLE OF IT. YOU KNOW NOT NOT JUST BECAUSE OF IT IN THE NEED TO YOU KNOW SOCIAL DISTANCE OR STAY HOME. BUT ALSO TIME OFF WORK CHILD CARE TRANSPORTATION RIGHT TELEHEALTH HAS SO MUCH PROMISE FOR OUR BEING ABLE TO EXPAND ACCESS IN THE FUTURE. AND WHEN I MENTIONED TELEHEALTH- WE MENTION THE DIGITAL DIVIDE- AND THE IMPORTANCE OF RETAINING AUDIO VISITS. AND WE CAN'T JUST DO TELEHEALTH AND ASSUME THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO YOU KNOW STREAM FIVE G. AND VIDEO VISITS- THE REALITY IS IT'S NOT POSSIBLE YET FOR MANY OF OUR PATIENTS- AND SO MAINTAINING THAT CONNECTION VIA AUDIO AS WELL AS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT- TWO. TWO THINGS THE FLAG ONE WHICH DR YOUNG REFERENCE SOME AND ALLUDED TO IS THE BIGGEST CRISIS POTENTIALLY FACING CLINICS RIGHT NOW IS WORKFORCE- I CAN I THINK I CAN SAFELY SAY EVERY SINGLE CLINIC ON OUR MEMBERSHIP. HAS MULTIPLE POSITIONS OPEN THAT THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO FILL- THIS WAS A CRISIS PRIOR TO COPE WITH IT AND IT'S JUST BEEN EXACERBATED BY COVE IN. EXISTING WORK FORCES OVER BURDENED OVERWORKED STRESSED OUT- WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WE DON'T HAVE PHYSICIANS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS WE DON'T HAVE ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS YOU KNOW THE- SOCIAL WORKERS. CALL CENTERS FRONT DESK WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF. AND THAT WILL HAMPER OUR ABILITY TO DO ANYTHING ABOVE AND BEYOND- SO I FLAG THIS BECAUSE I AM A BIT DISSIPATING THAT WILL BE LOOKING TO LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR. TO PROVIDE SUPPORT WITH REGARD TO HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE IN A PARTICULAR PRIMARY CARE WORK FORCE- AND SO THAT'S YOU KNOW LONGER PAYMENT OF THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED- IT'S ALSO. PROGRAMS AND SUPPORTS TO MAKE SURE DEVELOPING THE WORK FORCE THAT LOOKS LIKE AND FEELS LIKE OUR PATIENTS I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW CARLOS TORRES OF REMARKS HERE- WE NEED A WORKFORCE THAT OUR PATIENTS ARE COMFORTABLE WORKING WITH RIGHT WE WANT PEOPLE TO WALK WALK INTO A CLINIC AND FEEL LIKE. THEY'RE AT A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BE SERVED IN THAT THEY CAN BE APPRECIATED AND TREATED APPROPRIATELY- AND THAT'S A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK- WHICH STRUGGLING JUST WITH PROVIDERS IN GENERAL- AND SO REALLY GROWING THAT WORK FORCE- AT ALL LEVELS- IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE FACE RIGHT NOW. AND IT FEELS REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE DOING. MORE YOU DON'T RESOURCES FOR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS ARE GREAT BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE WORK FORCE TO PUT BEHIND IT WILL BE EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGE SO I THINK THAT'S- ONE TO MENTION. AND I'VE LOST TRACK OF MY TIME BUT IF I MIGHT MENTION ONE LAST THING- SPEAKING TO FLEXIBILITY AND RESOURCES AND HOW CRITICAL THAT IS. CLINICS MANY CLINICS IN CALIFORNIA ARE LOOKING AT THE IMPENDING LOSS OF ONE OF THE MORE FLEXIBLE FUNDING STREAMS THEY HAVE. AND THAT'S THE RESOURCES ASSOCIATED THAT THEY GET UNDER THE THREE FORTY DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM. AND THE STATE'S CHANGING WELL INTENTIONED THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MEDIC HELL BUT LONG STORY SHORT. IT WILL ELIMINATE THE SAVINGS THAT CLINICS ARE ABLE TO REALIZE FROM THAT PROGRAM AND WE'RE TALKING TO THE TUNES OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS I'M FOR A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS. AND THOSE ARE REALLY FLEXIBLE RESOURCES THEY'RE RESOURCES THE SUPPORT SOME OF THOSE WRAPAROUND PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT REALLY HELP CLINICS GEAR THEIR SERVICES TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THEIR PATIENTS AND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. COOKING CLASSES OR GROUP CLASSES- ALL THOSE ABOVE AND BEYOND AN EXTRA SERVICES. NEED THOSE KIND OF FLEXIBLE RESOURCES. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT DRYING UP SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER JANUARY ONE SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH YOU CHAMPION THIS FOR US IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET CYCLE- WE ARE GOING TO BE BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. REALLY LOOKING AND HOPING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL AUGMENT THE FUNDING POOL THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE TO OFFSET THAT LOSS- SO WE ARE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR THE EXISTING FUNDING. BUT CONCERNED THAT IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT FOR CLINICS TO CONTINUE DOING GOOD WORK THEY'RE DOING. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMENTS AND I'VE TAKEN SOME POINTS OUT. CERTAINLY BRING OUT- WITH RESPECT TO. HOW DO WE ENSURE CLINICS ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND IF IN FACT THAT THE PANDEMIC. WESTING HERE SO THAT'S WHAT YOU PONDER OVER THAT WILL COME BACK DURING THE QUESTION PERIOD- NEXT I WANT TO BRING UP- OUR FINAL PANELIST AND- SOMEONE WHO HAS A- I HAVE A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH AS DR JERRY ABRAHAM THE DIRECTOR OF CATHERINE'S VACCINE. AND DIVISIONS OF KATHRYN'S- COMMUNITY. HEALTH CLINIC WHO HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE DONE YEOMAN'S WORK WAS PARTNER WITH US AS WE WENT DOOR TO DOOR KNOCKING ON PEOPLE'S DOORS AND WHAT'S AND ALSO WOMAN TEN- HE'S BEEN RIGHT THERE- SO DOCTOR ABRAHAM THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR AVAILING YOURSELF WITH THIS TODAY- TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES INTO JUST SELF AND THEN. MOVE RANGE OF PRESENTATIONS. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE WITH YOU ALL TODAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MIKE GIPSON ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROBERT RIVAS. ESPECIALLY TO SOME MEMBER GAPS AND IT REALLY MEANS THE WORLD NOT. ONLY TO US TO DO THIS DAILY. FOR A LIVING BUT TO THE PATIENTS AND THE LIVES THAT ARE CHANGED IN TRULY SAVED BECAUSE OF THE- VACCINE ROLLOUT BECAUSE OF INCREASING ACCESS TO CARE SO. REALLY APPLAUD YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH I KNOW THAT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO AND WATCH IN WILMINGTON AND OTHER PARTS OF. ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SIXTY FOUR WE'VE COME A LONG WAY BECAUSE OF. YOUR INTENTIONAL WORK TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY HAVE ACCESS ESPECIALLY TO THESE LIFESAVING ESSENTIAL MEDICINES. AND MY NAME IS DR JERRY ABRAHAM I'M THE DIRECTOR OF KATRIN VACCINES IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES. I'M A COMMUNITY AND FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND A MEDICAL QUALITY SPECIALISTS PRACTICING IN SOUTH LA- CATHERINE IS AN ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL AND FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY CLINIC ASSOCIATION. AND WE WERE STARTED IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE BY TWENTY TWO BLACK PSYCHIATRY'S PSYCHIATRIST BACK. DURING THE WATTS RIOTS- WHEN BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE HAVE NOWHERE TO GO FOR MENTAL HEALTH ACCESS AND WE WERE IN A RISIS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WE FOUND OURSELVES AGAIN. IN TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE PANDEMIC HEAD. WE NEED. MARCH TWENTY TWO. ONE THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY IN THE PANDEMIC WERE DECLARED THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO. AS WE ALWAYS HAVE AS INGRAINED IN OUR DNA TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE THAT LIGHT ON HEALTH. THAT BEACON FOR HEALTH EQUITY THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES BUT RATHER WE TRULY WERE GOING TO BE. ON THAT DESERT ISLAND WRITING SOS AND THE SAND JUMPING UP AND DOWN AND WAVING OUR HANDS AND SAYING DON'T FORGET ABOUT US PLEASE. GIVE US WHAT IS OURS WE WILL COME AND TAKE IT PROUDLY. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID ON CHRISTMAS EVE EVE- DURING A WHEN THE VACCINES I TO. RECEIVE THE MERCIES AUTHORIZATION- FIZER BACK IN DECEMBER- KNOWING CONTACTED CATHERINE OUR PATIENTS OUR STAFF HAD COVERT OUR COMMUNITY. IN NINE ZERO ZERO ONE ONE SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT ZIP CODES WHERE ONE OUT OF FOUR PEOPLE WERE SUFFERING FROM COLD AND MANY WERE DYING FROM COVE IT. AS YOU SAW THE STATS THAT WERE ALREADY PRESENTED. HOW COULD YOU FORGET ABOUT US SO I PICKED UP THE PHONE ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND I DEMANDED WHERE ARE OUR VACCINES AND- YOU KNOW AS ALREADY MENTIONED THANK GOD THAT WE HAVE THIS WONDERFUL DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHO IS OUR SISTER. PARTNER ORGANIZATION AND IN THIS BEAUTIFUL FASHION OF PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WE WERE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WHAT HAPPENED. AND HOW DO WE GET ACCESS TO THOSE VACCINES AND BY NEW YEAR'S EVE EVE WE HAD RECEIVED OUR FIRST SIXTY DOSES. AND THEN THE NEXT DAY WE PUT HUNDRED DOSES INTO THE ARMS OF OUR NURSES AND PATIENTS. AND THEN ONE FIFTY TO NOW OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND VACCINES INTO THE ARMS OF. SOUTH ANGELENOS AND PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED. AND AGAIN THANKS TO ALL OF THE RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THE COUNTY EMERGENCY SERVICES. THE COMMUNITY CLINIC ASSOCIATION BECAUSE WE COULDN'T DO ANY OF THE SALON. THANK YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST SO THANKFUL FOR. THE ACCESS TO THESE LIFESAVING ESSENTIAL MEDICINES THAT OUR COUNTRY TOOK ACTION WE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THIS. PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. FASHION TO BRING TO SCALE AND TO. REALLY DISTRIBUTE THESE VACCINES BUT AS I TELL THE MANUFACTURERS FAIZABAD DHARNA AND JOHNSON AND JOHNSON. THEIR VACCINES ARE ABSOLUTELY AND UTTERLY USELESS IF THEY DON'T GET INTO THE ARMS OF THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT THE MOST AND SOMETHING THAT WE WERE VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT. I SAID ON THAT COUNTIES- COMMITTEE FOR. THE EQUITABLE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION AND WE WERE VERY INTENTIONAL WE WERE GOING TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES THAT WERE MADE IN SHOULD. AGO IN DC THE VACCINE LANDED IN THE EXACT OPPOSITE ZIP CODES. OF WHERE THAT ACTUAL INFECTION WAS AND WHERE PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY DYING FROM COVE IN NINETEEN SO. WE REALLY RACED AGAINST TIME TO GET THESE VACCINES INTO. PEOPLE'S ARMS BUT WE WERE MATT MOMENT AFTER MOMENT WITH BARRIER AFTER BARRIER- YOU KNOW WHAT APPOINTMENT HOW WERE OUR PATIENTS SUPPOSED TO GET AN APPOINTMENT THAT CLUNKY. YOU KNOW. IN THE BEGINNING WAS PROP MODERN MY TURN. THESE WERE NOT EASY ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE SENIORS THOSE THAT ARE AGING THOSE WITH. UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS DEVELOPMENTAL CHALLENGES MANY BORE SHOT OUT NO INTERNET NO EMAIL NO CELL PHONE. PEOPLE DON'T HAVE AN ADDRESS BECAUSE THEY ARE HOUSING IN SECURING IT THAT WAS A REQUIRED FIELD IN THE EARLY DAYS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. WE THOUGHT PEOPLE TO HAVE TRANSPORTATION AND THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO DODGER STADIUM WHERE WE SUPPOSED TO GO FOR YOUR VACCINES IN THOSE EARLIEST DAYS. I DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH WHERE MY SUPPOSED TO GO WE MADE SURE THAT THAT WAS NOT A BARRIER LIMITATION TO GETTING ACCESS TO VACCINES. IN OUR COUNTY WE MADE SURE THAT IF YOU COULDN'T SEE WALK TALK SOMEONE WOULD HOLD YOUR HAND AND GET YOU THROUGH AND GET YOU VACCINATED. AND BECAUSE OF ALL THE STRATEGIES WE HAVE THE VACCINE RATES THAT WE HAVE. AND MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FOR SURE. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAVED BECAUSE OF THESE VACCINES BUT THE LESSON HERE. IS THAT WE WERE NOT AT THE TABLE WHEN THOSE VACCINE. WHEN THE DISTRIBUTION- ALLOCATIONS WERE MADE THEY WENT TO WONDERFUL PLACES AND WE APPLAUD THEM. USC UCLA CEDARHURST DIGNITY HEALTH KAISER PERMANENTE. BUT IT'S REALLY THE ROOTS IN THE GROUND IT'S REALLY THAT NETWORK IN THE COMMUNITY THAT. IS READY TO RESPOND AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN HERE BUT AGAIN WE SOMEHOW GET. LEFT BEHIND WHEN THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE WHEN THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE BEING HAD. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE LEFT BEHIND IF WE ARE WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT IS. SOMETHING THAT- IS VIEWED AS- WE THINK ABOUT IF THIS TYPE OF ATROCITY OCCURS AGAIN IT'S NOTHING SHORT OF CRIMINAL TO BE HONEST I MEAN FOR THE MASCOT. ALL RIGHT- SO I ALSO WANTED TO SAY AND THE EARLIEST DAY AS WITH HER. RIDICULOUS THAT THERE WAS BLACK AND BROWN VACCINE HESITANCY FORTY TO SIXTY PERCENT. INSTEAD WHAT WE SAW IN OUR COMMUNITY WAS. WHAT VACCINE I'VE NEVER BEEN OFFERED A VACCINE HOWEVER HOW MAY BEING DOCUMENTED AS SOMEONE WHO. IS RELUCTANT HESITANT REFUSING A VACCINE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO TURN TO GET VACCINES IN OUR COMMUNITY- IN ADDITION TO THOSE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED IN GETTING THESE VACCINES OUT. WE KNEW THAT- YOU KNOW WHAT CATHERINE WE PRACTICE THIS THING CALLED THE CADRE WE HAVE MANY MANTRAS AND- ONE IS THAT THE EXPERIENCE COUNTS WE TREAT PEOPLE LIKE PEOPLE. WE RESPECT THE DIGNITY AND WORTH OF EVERY HUMAN BEING. AND WE MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE VERY INTENSELY WE ENGAGE YOU EDUCATEYOU VACCINATE AND ACTIVATE YOU. WHETHER YOU'RE WHITE BLACK BROWN YELLOW WHOEVER YOU ARE YOU HAD EVERY REASON TO HAVE. THESE CONCERNS QUESTIONS AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS OUR TRUSTED HEALTH PARTNER TO TAKE THE TIME TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS TO BE HONEST. TO EDUCATE YOU AND REALLY THAT'S HOW WE WOULD OVERCOME MANY OF THE LOWER VACCINATION RATES WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS NOT A EXPERIMENT ON OUR COMMUNITY THIS ISN'T THE TUSKEGEE TRIALS THE ABUSE OF HENRIETTA LACKS CELLS. THIS IS NOT THE UNDER TREATMENT OF BLACK PAIN IN OUR HOSPITALS THESE ARE LIFESAVING ESSENTIAL MEDICINES AND UNFORTUNATELY DIGITAL DEMANDS. HAVE SPREAD LIES THAT ARE ADVERSELY IMPACTING TRULY KILLING OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT- THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT WE MUST. CONTINUE TO SQUASH AS I WRAP UP MY COMMENTS I JUST WANT TO SAY WE'VE LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS. THIS IS NOT JUST A PANDEMIC OF AN INFECTIOUS ILLNESS THIS IS A SOCIAL ILLNESS AN ILLNESS OF ISOLATION OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY. THIS IS A PANDEMIC OF MISSED CARE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES. TO PREVENT TO MAINTAIN OUR HEALTH WE MUST GET BACK TO THAT. AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT WE CAN DEMOCRATIZE HEALTH THAT WE CAN MOVE AWAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL FOUR WALLS O OUR CLINICS AND HOSPITALS. THAT WE CAN AND TO THE EPIDEMICS HIV THE HEPATITIS PANDEMICS THE STI EPIDEMICS THAT ARE ALL AROUND US. AND WE DO ADVICE DECENTRALIZING EQUITY LET'S TAKE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED WITH THESE MOBILE VACCINATION EFFORTS THIS EQUITABLE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION MODEL. AND LET'S TACKLE THOSE BIG CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING OUR PATIENTS IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES AND ACROSS THE STATE. LET'S REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE LET'S ADDRESS INCONSISTENT POLICING LET US IMPROVE MATERNAL AND CHILD MORTAITY IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. LET US ADDRESS GLOBAL CLIMATE CRISIS HAD ON LET US CONTINUE TO TACKLE THE HOUSING SECURITY THAT IS ADVERSELY. MY PATIENTS AT MY CLINIC BUT WHEN WE ALL COME TOGETHER IT MAY NOT BE A DOCTOR OR NURSE WHO SOLVES IT MAY BE YOUR TEACHER MAY BE YOUR CULTURE MAY BE OUR PASTOR. YOUR COMMUNITY LEADER YOUR POLITICIAN YOU'RE A BALLOT YOUR T. ARE YOUR NEIGHBORS BUT WHEN WE ALL COME TOGETHER WILL ALL ACHIEVE THIS HEALTH EQUITY THAT WE SAW- YEARN FOR AND DESERVE EVERY PERSON OUR COMMUNITY DOES. OKAY WITH THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY DR ABRAHAM IT IS GREATER YOU GAVE A GREAT SUMMERS ASIAN OF EVERYTHING KERRY HERSELF. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND FOR YOUR COMMENTS. AS WELL AS YOUR PRESENTATION AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO OUR COMMUNITY AS ALL OF YOU ARE COMMITTED TO OUR COMMUNITY. THAT THIS POINT IN TIME WE WANT TO- I'M ASKING QUESTIONS- WE WANT YOU TO PONDER OF THOSE OF THOSE QUESTIONS BUT MY I'M GOING TO- DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE- SILVA RIVAS TO ASK THE FIRST QUESTION. AND THEN I'LL WILL BE JUST DO AN INTERCHANGING A DIALOGUE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME THAT WE HAVE. I'M TOGETHER SO. MEMBER RIVAS LAW. ALL- AND ALSO I'M SORRY WE ALSO HAVE INDIVIDUALS THE STILL- VIRTUALLY WITH US AS WELL SEE WHEN CALLING THEM AS WELL YES I APPRECIATED THOSE COMMENTS AND THE PANEL AND IT WAS. YOU KNOW- AT- EDUCATIONAL LEARN ABOUT WHAT WAS EXPERIENCE HERE ON THE GROUND CERTAINLY WHEN IT KIND. THE ONLY COMES TO THE VACCINE. THE DISTRIBUTION. PROCESS THAT WE EXPERIENCED AND YOU KNOW AND CENTRAL BECAUSE WORKING WITH AGRICULTURAL FARMWORKERS. VERY CHALLENGING SO MANY CULTURAL BARRIERS THAT WE HAD TO- YOU KNOW. BREAK DOWN- YOU KNOW IT'S SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW. WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY IN A RESOURCE. DESERT'S RESOURCE. CONSTRAINTS AND REALLY THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES. THROUGH THIS EQUITY LANDS. IS THIS IS BEST DONE BY LEVERAGING OUR LOCAL AND REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. AND IF SO- YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD SUPPORT OUR LOCAL CBO'S NONPROFITS THE WORK YOU GUYS DO HAVE RESOURCES AND YOU KNOW THE WAY OF MONEY AND- THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING- WHEN IT COMES TO THIS AREA OF SUPPORT. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUESTION SURE I CAN TAKE A STAB FIRST- NO PUN INTENDEDI DO VACCINATE ALL DAY. SO I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS DECENTRALIZATION AND DEMOCRATIZATION ARE CRITICAL. CONCEPTS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO IMPLEMENT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GO TO QUATERNARY. ACADEMIC MEDICAL MECCA AS AND OUR PATIENTS CAN'T GET THEIR THEIR SHUT OUT BUT THEY MAY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES IN THEIR PUBLIC HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR SCHOOLS IN THEIR CHURCHES IN THEIR PARKS AND RACKS I REALLY THINK THAT THISCONCEPT OF HEALTH. IN EVERY POLICY NEEDS TO BE FURTHER EXTENDED TO REALLY HEALTH IN EVERY INSTITUTION THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE A WAY TO ACCESS THAT SO NOT ONLY THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES. BUT TRULY CREATING BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND THE METAPHORICAL SPACE WHERE WE CAN REALLY TACKLE HEALTH AND NONTRADITIONAL HEALTH SETTINGS WILL GET US A LOT FURTHER AND IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY EVENT SO THAT IN CRISIS THAT BECOMES TRULY YOU'RE A MEDIA. NETWORK TO RUN THAT LAST MILE FIRST TO GET THOSE SHOTS IN ARMS IN THIS EXAMPLE THE PANDEMIC BUT REALLY JUST LIKE THE AMERICORPS JUST LIKE OUR- YOU KNOW PEACE KEEPING MISSIONS DURING PEACEKEEPING TIMES WE CAN BE PLANTING TREES WE CAN BE DOING. THE GOOD WORK WE NEED TO DO BUT DURING CRISIS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADD ACTIVATE AND PIVOT IN OUR COMMUNITY IS CAPABLE OF THAT AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MESSAGES THAT PEOPLE SOMETIMES DON'T REALLY GIVE US ENOUGH CREDIT TO KNOW. HOW MUCH WE CAN DO WHEN WE'RE TRUSTED WE WANT TO BE GOOD STEWARDS TO OUR OWN PEOPLE OUR OWN COMMUNITIES. THAT'S FANTASTIC I APPRECIATE HEARING AND SO IT'S- BUT NO BUT JUST TO MAKE CLEAR. THESE THESE THESE THE OF THIS SPECIFIC HEALTH MODEL OR THE- THE DELIVERY OF THE HEALTH SERVICES. THEY DEPEND ON BUT IT'S CERTAINLY IT'S JUST YOU KNOW. THE MODEL EXISTS BUT IT'S JUST HAVING THAT FLEXIBILITY TO DO IT IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE OBVIOUSLY. AND I JUST TOOK OF THAT AND I WILL GO BACK TO SOMETHING THEIR- FELLOW PANELISTS SAID THAT THE FLEXIBILITY BUT THEN I GO BACK TO THE INTENTIONALITY OF RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU THE FLEXIBILITY. TO DO THIS BUT THE STARTING OUTCOMES THAT WE EXPECT AS A RESULT RIGHT SO NICE JUST IS NOT A BLANK CHECK IF YOU WILL. TO DO ACTUALLY WHICH IS LIKE YOU DO. YOU CREATE A PARTNERSHIP THAT YOU FEEL ARE NECESSARY BUT THEY'RE ACT COMES ANY TO BE ATTACHED. TO THOSE- PARTNERSHIPS ARE I THINK THAT THAT THE GAME. INTENTIONALITY BECOMES CRITICAL. DR ROSS- FISHER ARE YOU STILL WITH US. OKAY I DON'T THINK HE IS STILL WITH US OKAY- RESTORES ONE ASK A QUESTION CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE US AN UPDATE- ON THE LATEST STATISTICS ON HIV AND THEN I HAVE ONE FOR TERRY SMITH TO FOLLOW UP ON AS WELL. ABSOLUTELY SO EXCITED AS I MENTIONED EARLIER PARTICULARLY IN IN THE LONG BEACH AREA WHICH IS WHERE- WE FOCUS OUR OUR SERVICE DELIVERY. AT THE RATE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AND THE LATEST REPORT WHICH IS FROM TWENTY NINETEEN S. YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE DATA IS THERE'S A DELAY IN GETTING THESE NUMBERS UT. BUT WE IN LONG BEACH- AS OF TWENTY NINETEEN HAD TWICE THE RATE OF HIV INFECTIONS AS TO THE STATE SO WE'RE AT TWENTY SIX- PER HUNDRED THOUSAND ESTATE WAS AT THIRTEEN PER ONE HUNDRED. SO IT'S IS VERY LERMAN AGAIN LIKE TERRY SAID EARLIER HE CONTINUES TO IMPACT YOUNG MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO. AND THE OTHER PIECE THAT IS REALLY. THERE BUT NOT THERE YET IS THE IMPACT ONOUR TRANS. BROTHERS AND SISTERS AGAIN BECAUSE THEY DATA COLLECTION DOESN'T REALLY REFLECT WHO THEY ARE SO SOMETIMESTHEY GET. PUT IN THE CATEGORY S. MAINLY SIX OF MAN WHEN IN FACT THIS KNOW WHO THEY ARE AS AN INDIVIDUAL SO THAT THERE'D BE A TRUE NUMBER IS A LITTLE UP SKEWER BECAUSE OF THAT. ANY WE CONTINUE TO DO YOU KNOW THIS BY THE EFFORTS OF HIV TREATMENT WHICH WE KNOW IS VERY EFFECTIVE A PERSON CAN GET TO UNDETECTABLE. AND HAVE VERY VERY IF NOT ZERO CHANCE OF TRANSMITTING HIV VIA SEXUAL ACTIVITIES WE HAVE CRAP. BUT THE SERVICE DELIVERY HOW THE MESSAGE GET TO THE INDIVIDUAL IN THAT IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH. Y. M. MY LIVED EXPERIENCE IS WILL I THINK THERE'S A CONTINUES TO BE A GAP AND OF COURSE. STI'S OR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS IS A PRETTY GOOD PREDICTOR IN MANY CASES OF A POTENTIAL HIV INFECTION SO. WE CONTINUE TO HELP OUR TO DO IN THAT REGARD AND IT'S THIS THAT THEY SIX CONTINUE TO BE ALARMING UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT. WHAT WILL BE EMAILED TO ME YOU MADE MENTION OF IT BECAUSE WE HAVE PREPPING WE HAVE TAP AND IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE RATE BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT LONG BEACH IS- AS AS HIGH AS IT IS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ITS TOTALITY SO I'M ALARMED BY THAT BECAUSE AGAIN THE CAMPAIGN WAS GETTING TO ZERO- AND THERE WAS A LOT H. CATION BEING DONE AND FUNDING TO GO ALONG WITH THAT BUT WITH YOUR NUMBERS YEARS DISTRICTS. THAT WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE ALARMED BECAUSE IS DOUBLE OR EQUAL TO CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL AFFECTION RATE AROUND HIV CORRECT AND SO AGAIN I GO BACK TO THE INTENTIONALITY RICE SO WE GETTING TO ZERO WHO'S GETTING THAT MESSAGE AND IN WHAT CONTEXT RIGHT BECAUSE- THEY CAMPAIGN CAN BE FANTASTIC I THINK I HAVE ALL THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES. BUT IF THAT MESSAGE DOESN'T GET TO ME IN A WAY THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS APPLICABLE TO MY LIFE. THE POINT RIGHT. IS IT'S POINTLESS. RIGHT MAP IF I TRANSIT PERSON WHO'S HOMELESS WHO'S FOOD INSECURE WHO DOESN'T HAVE THIS STABLE. HOUSING DO I CARE ABOUT PREP PROBABLY NOT. I CARE ABOUT IS THE ICE PROBABLY NOT THE AQABA HIV PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE I'M HOMELESS I'M HUNGRY I'M BAREFOOT AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THEIR OVER DRAMATISATION BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE THING A PICTURE THAT'S IMPORTANT YEAH I. DON'T HAVE TO BE APOLOGIZE APOLOGETIC FOR THAT WE APPRECIATE THAT DRAMATIZATION BRING THAT MESSAGE HOME UP FOR MISTER SMITH- I HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION OF PREVENTION ACTIONS TOWARDS HIV CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE US AN UPDATE ON HOW COBIT NINETEEN HAS IMPACTED HIV PREVENTION SERVICES. I'M THE IMPACT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT- WE TALKING ABOUT ACCESSING SEXUAL HEALTH SERVICES SO HIV TESTING STD SCREENING AND TREATMENT CRAP HAPPENS- OTHER SERVICES ARE SEVERELY RESTRICTED BY OF ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE BUSY RESPONDING TO COLD IT AND YOU KNOW RIGHTLY SO- AND THEN PREVENTION PROGRAMS THAT FOR TRADITIONAL ABOUT KIND OF BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER PRINCIPALLY THE TABLE HAVING CONVERSATION BUILDING COMMUNITY WE COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I WAS DANGEROUS. FOR THE COME TOGETHER AND SO ON THE IMPACT IS IN PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AND I THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TO CATCH UP. YOU KNOW- REPEAL A WE IMPLEMENTED A HOME TESTING PROGRAM RECENT TEST KITS OUT TO PEOPLE AT HOME AND THAT HAD HAS HAD SOMETHING TO TAKE BUT I THINK THAT- WHAT CAN WE WORK FOR OUR COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISENFRANCHISED AND AN IMPACT IS REALLY. BRINGING US TOGETHER- SITTING AROUND A TABLE COME- NORMALIZING SEX HEALTH ADDRESSING THE HOMOPHOBIA TRANSPHOBIA ALL THE THOUGHT THAT EXIST WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT'S GONNA HELP US GET AHEAD. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO AT THAT. I ASKED THE QUESTION I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO- DR- THE BALL- WITH RESPECT TO THE- GOVERNOR JUST CAME OUT WITH. INTEREST AND RUBIO THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS A SURPLUS- IN THE STATE AND IF YOU HAD TEN BILLION OF THE THIRTY ONE BILLION. HOW WOULD YOU DIRECT THOSE RESOURCES AND WHY. THANK YOU I LOVE THIS QUESTION AND THIS OPPORTUNITY- SO FIRST I WANT TO CONTEXTUALIZE MY RESPONSE AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT OUR CHILDREN RIGHT NOW ARE SLATED TO HAVE A LOWER LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN THEIR PARENTS. AND THAT REALLY DEMONSTRATES FOR US THAT WE'RE SLIPPING BACKWARDS IN TERMS OF SOCIAL AND HEALTH PROGRESS AND THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS ARE FAILING US IN TERMS OF HEALTH EQUITY. AND SO THIS IS THE PRODUCT OF MULTIPLE CRISES THE PANDEMIC CERTAINLY POLLUTED WATER AS WAS MENTIONED WILDFIRES PEOPLE CAN'T BREED RACIAL VIOLENCE THERE ARE MULTIPLE PANDEMICS THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH DAY IN AND DAY OUT. AND SO THIS IS A MOMENT TO SHIFT FROM THINKING ABOUT INCREMENTAL CHANGE OR REACTIONARY APPROACHES TO TRANSFORMATIVECHANGE TOO DEEP AND LASTING FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND TO GO TO GET THERE WE REALLY NEED TO BE INVESTING IN HISTORICALLY OPPRESSED GROUPS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE AT THE CENTER OF DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS TO THESE ISSUES. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE AT THE TABLE AND ARE EMPOWERED TO SHARE THEIR VISIONS AND SOLUTIONS TO THESE ISSUES WE ARE THE CARETAKERS FROM THEIR WORLD AND WE CAN BE LISTENING TO THEM- AND LEANING ON THEM FOR THESE SOLUTIONS. AND THIS PROCESS WOULD YIELD CONTEXTUALLY AND CULTURALLY SPECIFIC ACTION PLANS ARE THAT ARE BOTH LOCALLY SPECIFIC AND ALSO PROVIDE A PLATFORM IN A FRAMEWORK FOR GUIDING STATE LEVEL WORK AND I WOULD POINT TO SYSTEM LEVEL CHANGES AS WELL AS NEW COMMUNITY DRIVEN SOLUTIONS AND SYSTEMS. AT TO POINT US ON A PATH TOWARD HEALTH EQUITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I WANT SOMEONE ELSE ASPECT ANSWER THAT QUESTION FROM YOUR OWN- LANDS BUT I WANT TO. BEFORE I OPEN THAT QUESTION UP AGAIN I WANNA GO TO- MS HENDRICKS ARE YOU STILL WITH US. VIRGINIA YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A MEMBER OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN CAUCUS CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE US AN UPDATE ON WHAT TYPE OF SERVICES THE CALIFORNIA CONCERT CONCERTS CONSORTIUM OF URBAN INDIAN HEALTH IS DOING- AROUND THIS WORK PROMOTING HEALTH EQUITY.

RACIALLY MISCLASSIFIED YOU KNOW HE'S GETTING HELP OR YOU KNOW THAT OUR PEOPLE WERE DEVASTATED BY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND WERE. GIVEN THE NAME HER LONG LAST AND SO THAT WE SEE THAT BACK ON US WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH DATA SO WE ARE VERY LITERALLY BEING BORN AGAIN AND DYING WHITE THAT BEING ARDESTAN AGAINST YOU KNOW DIRECTORS ARE YOU GETTING ARE EASY AS- WHITE. OR HISPANIC. PHENOTYPICALLY IF YOU'RE WHITE BLACK WILL BE LAID ASSET AND- THERE'S A- GAS IT IS UNDER. THAT HOW OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST LEGAL AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE. THROUGH FEDERAL AND- TO THE DATA CALIFORNIA AND NOW HEALTH. GENERATIONS OF I'M WE DO WORK YOU KNOW YOU WORK ON INCREASING- HEALTH COMMUNITY. MANAGER HEALTH- AND THIS IS. OF WE HAVE A REALLY LARGE AROUND I GOT A SINGLE UNIT THAT THANK YOU AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW LIKE SUBSTANCE STARTED IN GOAL LATER IN THIS HAD AN IMPACT AROUND USING YOU TO GET UPDATED BY. APPDYNAMICS AND NOBODY REALLY CARED ABOUT. THAT IT ENTAILS WHITE PEOPLE STARTED DYING OPIOIDS IN FACT CHARGING YOU HAVE AN IDEA HEROIN OVERDOSES OR JACKIE'S AND WE WANT TO MAKE THIS PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROBLEM BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT EXIST. IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND ANY. TALK ABOUT IT BUT WE HAVE TO START EQUITY ENDING LIKE SHOULD THIS IS. THINGS LIKE THAT ALSO GOES WAY FOR COMMUNITY AND WALKING AROUND REALLY MEET OUR HANDS ON IT TO SAY WERE. MORE NOT WORK- SO. YOU KNOW ANYMORE WE. CAN YOU HEALTHCARE DELIVERY COMMUNITIES TALK ABOUT WHAT IS OUR NEXT. EDUCATION ASSISTANCE. HOW CAN STARTING OCT IN THE HANDS EVERYBODY. COULD USE IT I THINK THAT HE WROTE MANAGED HEALTH DURING CANADA PASSED LOADED FOR ACTING IS WAITING ABOUT. I HAVEN'T OF- BUT- FIRST TIME OF REPORT. DAYS OF NO NO SHOWS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THAT MEANS EVERY PERSON MILLION APPOINT SHE UP TODAY. ALL THE WAY AND WHICH SAYS TRUMAINE I'LL OF NOW AMERICAN EVEN INSTITUTED CALIFORNIA DURING THE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU TOO ON A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION- I APPRECIATE THAT- I'M TO GO- TO- WITH THIS NEXT- AS- IT'S HOW DO WE- THAT THE CLINICS. ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND AGAIN- WITH ANOTHER PANDEMIC BUT BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION I'M GONNA ASK MY COLLEAGUE- MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS. EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN RAISED HERE TODAY IN CONVERSATION. IS WHEN FOLKS THE LATINO COMMUNITY AN AFRICAN AMERICAN LADY SO YOU'RE THE VICE CHAIR OF THE OF THE- LIKE THE YOU KNOW A LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I'M A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A HEARING. A JOINT HEARING WITH BOTH CAUCUSES. TO REALLY PUSH THE DISPARITY OUT SO WE CAN ONE NOT ONLY EDUCATE OUR OWN COLLEAGUES. BUT ALSO COME UP WITH THE REAL CONCRETE PLANT. AND WOULD BE WILLING TO- GET YOUR THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF US TRYING TO ORGANIZE- WITH THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE COMMUNITY WOULD ABSOLUTELY BENEFIT. SAYING THAT BLACK AND BROWN LEADERS COMING TOGETHER AROUND THE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE AGAIN- THIS PANDEMIC HAS FURTHER EXACERBATED THIS TO THE AND REYES THEN ROSE TO THE LEVELS WE ARE RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACKWARDS MORE TO MOVE FORWARD BUT WE WANT TO LEARN FROM THE PAST. SO THAT WE WON'T REPEAT IT AGAIN SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE TO YOU AND QUESTION YOUR THOUGHTS. OR THE JOINT YEAH SO YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO WORK- YOU KNOW- ON THAT- ISSUE. WHEN YOU A YOU KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN SHARED IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY EDUCATIONAL- BUT AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER- MISTER GIBSON THE- INJURED JUST MENTIONED YOU KNOW THE- IMPACTS. THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED THAT WE KNOW EXIST THAT ONLY BE EXACERBATED BY THIS PANDEMIC. WE KNOW THAT. GOOD DATA OR THAT. THAT THAT RESEARCH AND THAT DATA SHOULD DRIVE PUBLIC POLICY THE DATE AS YOU HAVE ALL MENTIONED EXISTS IS THERE ARE WE KNOW THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND. NOW WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT- AND YOU KNOW. I'M PROUD TO BE A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE AM PROUD TO BE PART OF THE LATINO CAUCUS THE LARGEST AT THE CAUCUS OF ANY STATE LEGISLATURE AND ALL OF. THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BECAUSE TOO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND IF HISTORICALLY BEEN LEFT BEHIND. AND SO IF WE CAN'T DO SOMETHING NOW- IT YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW CERTAIN- YOU KNOW THAT'S- A DISAPPOINTMENT. AND TO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO GET SOMETHING DONE BECAUSE- IT'S- INCREDIBLY OVERDUE. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOINT. THANK YOU YES THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AND I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF BRINGING MULTIPLE CAUCUSES TOGETHER ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT GIVE ME TIME TO NOODLE ON THE- HOW. WE CAN ENSURE THAT CLINIC ASSOCIATION CLINICS ARE LEFT OUT IN FUTURE PANDEMIC- I AGAIN I'M FEELING HEARTENED BY THE POSITION THAT C. C. A. L. A. C. THE CLINICS IN LOS ANGELES OR IN A RELATION TO OUR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN OUR COUNTY HEALTH SERVICES. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN BETTER SHAPE IN MY CONCERN IS PROBABLY MORE BROADLY FOCUSED ON OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES IN OTHER REGIONS DON'T HAVE THE KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS HERE IN LA- IF I WAS LOOKING AT PIECES THAT CONCERNED ME THINKING GOING FORWARD WITH THE NEXT PANDEMIC LOOKS LIKE. I WOULD BE SOMEWHAT CONCERNED AND CURIOUS HOW WE MIGHT INSTITUTIONALIZE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH PUBLIC HEALTH IN REGARDS TO. YOU KNOW PANDEMIC PLANNING. WE HAVE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RIGHT NOW. BUT HOW DOES THAT RELATIONSHIP GET TO THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL SO THAT YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE TURNED OVER AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE NO LONGER THERE. DID IT DOES THE RELATIONSHIP FLOUNDER A LITTLE BIT- SO THAT'S SOMETHING ON MY MIND AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY ON THE MIND OF LOTS OF FOLKS LOOKING FORWARD- AT MY ORGANIZATION. YOU KNOW WE RUN AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WE DO WORK CLOSELY HISTORICALLY WHAT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE WORK WITH PUBLIC HEALTH FUND. YOU KNOW AS- IS- AND HIV BUT THIS ISSUE OF PANDEMIC PLANNING FEELS. FRESHER NEWER TO US- SO YEAH REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THAT'S PART OF. EMERGENCY PLANNING THAT IT'S NOT JUST EARTHQUAKES TERRORIST EVENTS SOME OF THINGS THAT WERE INCLUDED. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS- FOR ME I WAS RUNNING AROUND MY TEAM WAS RUNNING AROUND LIKE A CHICKEN WITH ITS HEAD CUT OFF. WE WORK OF HUSTLING- WE WERE BEGGING FOR PP- COUNTY UNIVERSITY MINGUS HILLS THE STUDENTS WERE MAKING A MASK AND WE I PURCHASED- FIVE HUNDRED- MASS I'M VERY GRATEFUL THESE ARE THE SCHEELS SCHEELS- THAT THE STUDENTS HERE CASSIDY UNIVERSUM IN HIS HEELS ARE MAKING ON A DAILY BASIS. AND I TOOK THOSE MY TEAM TOOK THOSE WITH PP EQUIPMENT AND- FACE MASKS DANCING WE TOOK THOSE TO CLINICS. IN THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT AGAIN. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO- DOCTOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSION SHOULD NOT HAVE TO. IN THE FIFTH WORLD ECONOMY DAMMIT WEAR THE SAME UNIFORM OVER AND OVER AGAIN- WHILE TRYING TO SERVICE. I'M IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC- I WAS VERY DISHEARTENED BY THAT- I KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR FIRST TIME BEING IN SUCH A PANDEMIC. SO THERE'S NO ROAD MAP IN TERMS OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO I WAS BY TRIAL AND ERROR I DO WANNA TRY THAT NO MORE. I SAID NORMAL. OKAY SO. WE NEED TO IS THERE A PLAN IN PLACE FOR CLINICS MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE A WHAT JUST TRANSPIRED ON THE NEWS- WITH THIS NEW VARIANTS. I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF IT OKAY. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT THIS IS CREEP INTO OUR RICK THAT WE HOW TO HAVE IT AND MY CONCERN A- THAT THE CLINICS. HAS COMMUNICATED WITH KNOWLEDGE COUNTY HEALTH OF DEPARTMENTS BUT THE STATE AS WELL TO MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS THE BLUEPRINT BASED ON OUR PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE THAT IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS THAT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO IMMEDIATELY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT EXISTS. I DO BELIEVE IT'S IF NOT FULLY FLESHED OUT- IN BETTER SHAPE THAN IT WAS PREVIOUSLY- I SAID OUR ARRANGEMENT WITH THE COUNTY FOR DISTRIBUTION OF PP WALL ROCKY AT FIRST AND LARGELY. THAT WAS BECAUSE THE COUNTY DIDN'T HAVE IT TO DISTRIBUTE- ONCE THEY DID IS JUST IN PLACE WHEREBY GOT. FOR THE COUNT WE JUST THAT TO MEMBERS. AND MEMBER- CLINICS ALSO GET P. P. DIRECTLY FROM THE COUNTY. BUT THERE IS A BIG CHALLENGE IN A BOTTLE NECK WAS THAT WE RENTED STORAGE UNITS THE CLINIC ASSOCIATION. RESTORE PP SO IT STARTED FLOWING IN BUT CLINICS DON'T HAVE THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO STORE THREE OR SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR WORTH OF PP ON SITE- AND THAT'S A VERY THAT I THINK. STILL NEEDS TO BE OVERCOME IN LOOKING FORWARD AND THINKING ABOUT FUTURE PANDEMICS IS THAT THEY OPERATE ON SUCH TIGHT MARGINS AND SPACE IS AT A PREMIUM AND THEN A LATE. SPACE COST A FORTUNE- AND HAVING THAT TYPE OF STORAGE PROVED A VERY SEVERE LIMITATION- AND YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT YOU DON'T. SEE CLEC RENTING A STORAGE UNIT IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD LONG TERM SOLUTION IN THINKING ABOUT FUTURE PANDEMIC PLANNING-ABSOLUTELY. ADD TO THAT PLEASE BUT I DON'T. GT THIS ONE TO ADD A CUP QUICK COM. BUT YOUR- WHO THAT ONLINE. SORRY MONEY TO START OF THE WAY BUT I'M GOING TO ENOUGH I CAN THE WATER. ONE FIVE I DIDN'T GET ANY TO BE YOU WHY. NOT PROVIDED THERE ANYTHING ALL THE BACK ON THE LARGE. ALL IN ONE. WONDERS WHO AND IS FOR THE STATE. YOU HAVE NOT ONLY A- DIVISIONS AT. IT AT HOME. THAT ASKED THE LOCAL CAN ON LAW OUT. SO IF YOU HAVE A WHERE HOW. YOU KNOW WE ALL PD AND IN THE THAT TO OUR DATA. WORKERS OF THE OR GET A IT ON THE OF DIDN'T ROW. THE ENVIRONMENTAL THE DAY WITH NOT A- THAT'S ONE. WE HAD A LITTLE AND- LOT ANGELES COUNTY- WE DON'T HAVE THE BILL TO DO THAT AMONG. THAT IS ONE WAY TO CONSIDER PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE TO UPDATE AND SURE TO CONDITION WE WERE OKAY- IN OUR- WHO'S ALWAYS FRESH. THE TWILIGHT ZONE YOU KNOW IS THIS REALLY THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY THAT YOU KNOW FIRST WHATEVER. ICONOMI AND SO- SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE SELECT COMMITTEE IS FOCUSED ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN ADDITION TO HIV. HEPATITIS AND S. T. EYES WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE PANDEMICS LIKE CORONAVIRUS- YOU KNOW WHAT ROLE DOES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PLAYED NOW AS A NATION AND WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE- AN- EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES GLOBALLY. KNOWING THAT IT DOES HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT HERE AT IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SUB SAHARAN AFRICA RIGHT NOW WITH THE SOUTH AFRICAN VARIANT IF AFRICA DOES NOT GET ACCESS TO VACCINES THERE WILL BE ANOTHER MUTATION AND IT WILL TRAVEL THE WORLD AND IT WILL COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA SO. I THINK THERE HAS TO BE PRESSURE APPLIED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE HAS TO BE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT INFECTION SEE NO BORDERS OR BOUNDARIES SO WE TALK ABOUT BORDER AN IMMIGRANT HEALTH. THOSE HAVE DIRECT-IMPLICATIONS ON THE HEALTH OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO HELP OUR STATE FOCUS SOME ATTENTION AND RESOURCE THERE. AS WELL AS PUTTING THAT PRESSURE ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND UNDERSTANDING WHEN APPROACHING THESE ISSUES IT IS ABSOLUTE RESPONSIBILITY TO ALSO ADDRESS THAT AT SOME GLOBAL LEVEL AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DR YOUNG ARE YOU STILL WITH US. I DON'T THINK YOU ARE STILL YOUNG FROM. STRAIGHT FROM CHARLES UNIVERSITY OF MEDICINE AND SCIENCE- SOCIT PROFESSOR IF AGAIN THE QUESTION- IF IN FACT WHAT THE GOVERNOR REVEALED THAT HE HAS THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS OF IF YOU HAD TEN BILLION BECAUSE YOU WERE ON THE FRONT LINE AND- WE SPOKE- EXTENSIVELY AT. SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING ASKING FOR HELP AND WE STOOD UP AND GOT THE KIND HELP THAT YOU- HOPEFULLY NEEDED TO DURING THE TIME- AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC SO WITH THE RESOURCES. TEN BILLION DOLLARS YOU HAD IT WILL YOU DO WITH IT. I THANK YOU FOR THAT PERSON I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND SAY IS THAT. I AM. DURING THE NEXT WALKING AROUND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DILLON IZED. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT WE CANNOT DO THAT WE CANNOT BLAME THE OPPRESSED FOR WHAT HAS OCCURRED IT TO THEM BUT THE OTHER THING THAT IS REALLY COME FORTH DURING THIS TIME IS THAT IT'S- I. UNDERSTANDING COMES TO REALIZE JUST THE LEVEL OF TRAUMA THAT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE EXPERIENCED. I'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND AND REALIZE THAT THE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING ITSELF IN MANY OTHERS NEEDS ARE REFUGEES. I THOUGHT THAT ONE OF THE PASTORS IN COMMENTED THAT THE SAME CHURCH IS MY FAMILY HE'S TEXAS. MY FAMILY LEFT THE SOUTH BECAUSE OF THE OPPRESSION OF THE EXPERIENCE THERE THEREFORE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE MUST INVEST IN. IS TRAUMA INFORMED CARE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES THIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR. OUR AS ADAM. WITH MY GENERAL HENRIK. THAT PEOPLE HAD A BOUNTY ON THEIR HEADS. THAT YOU HAD TO CLEAN IT THAT THEY WERE. LATINO OR MEXICAN SO THAT THEIR VILLAGES THAT ARE COMMUNITIES WENT BE WIPED OUT SO IN ADDITION TO YOUR- AB OR REALLY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS OUR PAST WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE GLOBAL PHARMA. BECAUSE WITHOUT THE PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED WE HAD NOT. FULLY RECOVER AS A COMMUNITY I HOPE THAT THAT KIND OF MAKES SENSE I THAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES IT IS TEN- HE- SERVICE THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE'VE GOT YOU BESTED SO WITH TEN MILLION DOLLARS WHAT WILL YOU DO. WE WILL EDUCATE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. STARTING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I'M WILL PROVIDE BASIC LEVELS OF TRAINING FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF OUR NEEDS THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. WE WILL DEVELOP A HOSPITAL IN THOSE AREAS THAT WE YOU. NEED HIGHER LEVELS OF CARE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY Q. AND SOUTH LA. YEAH WE HAVE THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATE OF INCIDENCE. COUNTY WE DO NOT HAVE A LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTER IN SOUTH PHILLY YEAH WE HAVE THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATES. MORE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH OUR CLINIC SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE HOSPITAL IS SO HARD TO GET SOMEONE INTO A HOSPITAL AND HOW THE ADMITTING PRIVILEGES. WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS TEN BILLION SB DO IT ALL THE TEN MILLION THIS IS ALL IN FEW KEY SAFETY TOOLS B. R. INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE TRAINED NOT ONLY AND- YOU KNOW THAT C. P. R. EMTS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO NALOXONE. SO AGAIN WE HAVE STRATEGIES THAT CAN WORK WE CAN TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES. AND I THINK DOCTOR ABRAHAM'S STATEMENT. YOU KNOW WE KNOW HOW SHE NAVIGATES OUR COMMUNITY WE KNOW HOW. TO TALK TO OUR OWN PEOPLE. WE CAN MANY OF US ARE MORE. MANY ARE MORE. WE KNOW HOW TO MOVE BETWEEN COMMUNITY. SO TEN BILLION. YES PLEASE NOT DOOR GET IT DONE AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR OUR PEOPLE. VERY MUCH FOR THAT- LET ME GO TO THE DOCTOR ABRAHAM WHAT ARE SOME OF THE NEW WHAT ARE SOME OF THE I WILL SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH BECAUSE- YOU RAISE THE ISSUE I'D WE I HEARD IT A LITTLE BIT HERE BUT YOU BROUGHT IT HOME. AND THAT'S THE TRAUMA- THIS PANDEMIC HAS MISSED A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE UP- WITH YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL OR NOT WHERE THE DIFFERENCE I THINK WE ALL SUFFER FROM SOME FORM OF TRAUMA- AND RESOURCES GOING IN THAT AREA IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- I'M GOING IN IN THE IN THIS SPACE SO. SOMEBODY MAY WANT TO ALSO TOUCH BASES ON THAT BUT I'LL GO TO DOCTOR ABRAHAM WHAT ARE SOME OF THE NEW THE NEWS- YOU ARE HEARING OR ON THE GROUND OF AS IT RELATES TO VACCINE DISTRIBUTION- WHAT ELSE IS NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS- THE LACK OF RESOURCES IN OUR COMMUNITY. SURE I'LL START BY JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW DR YOUNG AND I'VE WORKED TOGETHER IN THE PAST WE'VE WORKED SPECIFICALLY ON VACCINES WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY I MEAN THIS REALLY GOES TO SHOW WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER SO MANY OF US HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED TOGETHER IN MANY DIFFERENT CAPACITIES. ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SO THAT NETWORK IS THAT POWERFUL AND STRONG IF ONLY WE HAD THE RESOURCES AND INVESTMENT- BUT I WILL SAY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCTURALLY. WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES AS I THINK WE HAVE TO APPROACH HEALTH AS A CONTINUUM AND THAT CONTINUE MUST INCLUDE PRIMARY CARE. AS ONE OF ITS FOUNDATIONS ALONG WITH MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ALONG WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND RIGHT NOW THOSE SILOS ARE ALSO DESTRUCTIVE THERE COME WE'RE COMPETING INTERESTS RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S- TROUBLESOME BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED TO APPROACH THIS. AS HEALTH A CONTINUUM AND THAT NEEDS TO INCLUDE PRIMARY SECONDARY TERTIARY QUATERNARY CARE BUT ALSO EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE TO COMPARTMENTALIZE MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE ADDICTION AND ALL THIS. DETERMINE INCLUDING HOUSING. AND THEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH PEACE AND WE SEE THAT FRAGMENTATION HERE IN THE COUNTY THAT EXIST IN THE STATE. AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TYPES OF BITING STRUCTURAL BARRIERS IF WE CAN FIND WAYS TO MOVE. FURTHER AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION BETWEEN THOSE SILOS PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HELPED US A LOT SOONER DURING THE PANDEMIC. OF AS FAR AS THE VACCINES WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE I MEAN IT'S A TOUGH THING TO SAY EVERY DAY WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE EVERYDAY PEOPLE. ARE STRUGGLING TO CHOOSE VACCINES FOR THEMSELVES THEIR CHILDREN. NOW WITH THIS OMICRON VARIANT WE'RE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID ABOUT SHOULD I GET A BOOSTER NOW OR WAIT UNTIL AND NEXT GENERATION. VACCINE IS DEVELOPED WE REALLY HAVE TO SAY LOUD AND CLEAR IF YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN YOUR FIRST OR SECOND DOES. PLEASE GO GET VACCINATED NOW WE REALLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE OVER EIGHTEEN TO PLEASE GO GET A BOOSTER RIGHT OW. I BELIEVE THAT THE MANUFACTURERS WELL LOOK AT NEXT GENERATION VACCINES ESPECIALLY IF WE REALIZE THAT HOME ACROSS ON. THE ESCAPE RISK IS HIGH AND THESE VACCINES ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE OUR STRATEGY BUT WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH IN THE LAST FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MONTHS THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO GO. TO THE DARK DAYS OF MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AND GO DOWN THAT SHUT DOWN THE ROAD SO I APPLAUD ALL THE MEASURES THE STATE HAS TAKEN. THE COUNTY L. A. U. S. D. WITH THEIR VACCINE MANDATES THESE ARE ALL THE STEPS THESE ARE THE LAYERING STEPS THAT KEEP US SAFE AND WHEN WE DO THOSE THINGS. WE CAN KEEP OUR ECONOMIES OPEN WE CAN SEND OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL WE CAN GET BACK TO DOING ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE MISS DOING FOR FIFTEEN. TO TWENTY MONTHS SO YES GET BACK SAY CONTINUE TO WEAR MASKS SOCIAL DISTANCE HAND HYGIENE THAT'S ALL PART OF IT BUT OF COURSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THIS MOMENT WE'RE GOING TO WATCH VERY CLOSELY. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THIS PARTICULAR VARIANT HOW CONCERNING IS THAT THEIR FIFTY PLUS MUTATIONS ON THIS VARIANT AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DOWN THE ROAD AND EVEN FOR FUTURE VARIANTS AND AS I MENTIONED IF THE WORLD ISN'T VACCINATED. THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A MAJOR THREAT MOVING FORWARD. YOU A DOCTOR A REVIEW HIT ON SOMETHING A NERVE- WHAT IS. CROSS ON- AND THEY SPEND. THAT HAS OBVIOUSLY ORIGINATED. IN AFRICA- WOULD YOU SAY THAT IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY. TO PUT RESOURCES THERE. SO THAT IT WON'T COME HERE. I MEAN I THINK THE MESSAGE HAS TO BE NOW IN THE STATE BUT ALSO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- TRIED TO GET AHEAD OF THIS THING SO THAT AGAIN WE DON'T SEE. IT POPPING UP HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA NOTHING JUST CLOSED THE BORDERS IN SAYING TO PEOPLE CAN COME IN IS NOT ENOUGH WE HAVE TO PUT RESOURCES. INTO THAT JUST AS MUCH AS WE NEED TO PUT RESOURCES IN ALL COMMUNITIES AND EVERYTHING BOILS DOWN TO THE RESOURCES COMING INTO OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN THIS IN THIS COMMUNITY AND TRYING TO A UNDER- NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND BUT ALSO ADDRESS UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS. THAT PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH IN OUR COMMUNITY SO WITH THAT- THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH- DOES ANYONE ELSE. WANT TO CHIME IN ON ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID OR YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NOT COVERED. AROUND THIS TOPIC. I KNOW WE'VE COVERED- AWFUL- A LOT OF AND I REALLY APPRECIATE CAN ADD NE IMPORTANCE OF CONCEPT HERE IS THAT I THINK THE CORPORATE TO VACATION THAT WE'RE SEEING WITH AND TO HELP SPACE HAS SERIOUS NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS ON THE GROUND SO YOU SAW THAT RETAILERS AND MAYBE RETAIL PHARMACIES HAD ACCESS TO VACCINES AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SECURE THEM AND LOCK THEM AWAY RIGHT WITH- OUT REALLY DISTRIBUTING THEM AND YET IT WAS THE COMMUNITY CLINICS AND- THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT THAT REALLY WAS OUT THERE GETTING THOSE SHOTS AND ARMS IN SOUTH. WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW BIG THESE MEDICAL MECCA AS AND OTHER PIECES OF THE HEALTHCARE LANDSCAPE AND THE CANNIBALIZATION THAT'S OCCURRING IN THE CORPORATIZATION THEY HAVE A REAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS THEY MAY NOT HAVE P. P. SHORTAGES BUT EVERYONE ELSE DID THEY MAY HAVE GOTTEN VACCINES FIRST AND THEN THEY LOCKED HIM UP THOSE TYPES OF WE'VE CREATED A STE- INFRASTRUCTURE WE'VE CREATED A SCENARIO WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING AND IS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN WE'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS TO CHECK AND BALANCE THAT. AND I THINK THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH WHERE WE HAD WITH INCREASING ACCESS TO CARE WE'RE GONNA TO WATCH REALLY CLOSELY THESE VERY LARGE ELEPHANTS THAT ARE IN THE ROOM THAT WE CANNOT CONTROL TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE THAT ARE YOU KNOW REALLY ABLE TO LOBBY THEIR BEST INTERESTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT THEY HAVE REAL SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR WHETHER WE HAVE ACCESS TO LIFE SAVING ESSENTIAL MEDICINES WHETHER WE HAVE ACCESS TO CARE INOUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO I REALLY THINK THAT CORPORATIZATION NEEDS TO BE PRIORITIZED AND SEE HOW DO YOU PUT SOME CHECKS AND BALANCES ON THAT ROUTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY COLLEAGUE MADE MENTION OF THE SITUATION THAT TRANSPIRED IN HIS DISTRICT WHERE- IN THE- I THINK WAS A YOUNG PERSON HAD TO GO TO- A BUSINESS ECSTATIC MITIGATE INTERNET- TELEHEALTH IS A MODERN DAY- TECHNOLOGY THAT WE USE BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE COULD NOT GO TO THE HOSPITAL- AND WE COULD COULD NOT CONSULT A DOCTOR SO WE YOU YOU- TELL A- IN ORDER TO BE TO COMMUNICATE. WHATEVER THE SITUATION MAY BE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO REALIZE- THAT PEOPLE THAT BROADBAND WASN'T REALLY AVAILABLE IN. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES SPECIALLY AND I KEEP ON SAYING THIS- PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. ARE YOU CAN EXPECT SOMEONE OR YOU CANNOT EXPECT A CHILD TO DO DISTANCE LEARNING- AT HOME WITH THEIR INTERNET SERVICE IS NOT EXISTENCE RIGHT. AND SO THE LEGISLATURE PUT OF THE GOVERNOR PUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN TO TRY TO CONNECT. CREEK CONNECTIVITY- FROM THE RULE AND URBAN COMMUNITIES- AND SO WE HAVE IT IS REYES AS THE ISSUE BECAUSE- SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO USE THAT METHOD OR TO COMMUNICATE. AND IF YOU DON'T IF YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED YOU CAN'T COMMUNICATE- AND I KNOW OUR SENIORS BECAUSE I'VE- HEARD IT MULTIPLE TIMES. THAT I DON'T HOW TO USE A COMPUTER- BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LEAVE THAT POPULATION OF OUR COMMUNITY OUT THOSE ARE ELDERS THOSE ARE SENIORS. AND THAT'S A VERY- BARBEL POPULATION EXPANSION WE TALK ABOUT THIS PANDEMIC AND SO. WE'RE MINDFUL WHEN WE WE'VE DONE THE WORK AND WILL CONTINUE TO RAISE THIS ISSUE- WILL RETURN BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE- IN JANUARY I WANT TO GO TO- MISTER SMITH- TERRY SMITH- TEN BILLION DOLLARS BROTHER. TEN BILLION DOLLARS TELL ME BECAUSE WE TAKE IT IS IDEAL TO WRITE THEM DOWN AND WE WANT TO TRY SOMETHING WE NEVER TRIED BEFORE INFLUENCE OF WHATEVER IMPLEMENT. BUT WE ALSO WILL BE A MOUTH PIECE FOR YOU WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS A CONVERSATION SACRAMENTO SO TEN BILLION DOLLARS I THOUGHT ABOUT IT- K. SO IF I HAD TWO MILLION DOLLARS I WOULD OPEN UP A CHAIN OF. JIFFY LUBE LIKE. SEVERAL CENTERS. FOR PEOPLE TO GO AND GET SCREENED. HIV STDS GIVE CRAP- LATE HOURS WEEKENDS WHATEVER MAKE THIS EASIEST POSSIBLE GET YOU KNOW THE SOONEST POSSIBLE. I WOULD DO IT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. AS POWERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
