I DON'T KNOW IT IS NOT COMING FROM US AT THIS TIME THANK YOU REFERRED TO AB. ONE SIXTY ONE. MAYBE ONCE ONE. YOU'RE A CHECKING OR- SORRY MY ADDITIONAL COMMENTSWERE ALSO COVERED AB ONE SIXTY ONE- THAT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED. OR WILDFIRE PREVENTION THE INCREASE IN COSTS FOR GUBERNATORIAL RECALL ELECTION ON THE FIFTEEN MILLION- APPROPRIATED THE SAN JUAN- SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY AND THEN THE VARIOUS TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS. THANK YOU THAT'S GOOD OF NUMBERS FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MR. FOR BUT I THINK THIS YEAR WHAT IS JOB RIGHT DOWN THE LIST ON- SB ONE THIRTY- CAN YOU PROVIDE THE RATIONALE FOR EXTENDING A LOT OF- THE EXAM THE MORATORIUM ON NEW CLASSROOM. ANON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS WAS THERE WAS A REASON WHY THAT WAS PUT INTO THAT TRAILER. CHIU CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THE FOCUS OF THE TRAILER BILL IN ITS OWN RETURNING STUDENTS TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS THERE ARE PROVISIONS FOR- IN THE ENHANCED INDEPENDENT STUDY. MOST OF WHICH APPLY TO. CHARTER SCHOOLS. OR OR OR BE ABLE TO OUR TRADITIONS SO I MEAN THESE NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS EXISTED PRE PANDEMIC SO I AM AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT- WE CERTAINLY WANT TO YOU- ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO GO BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM BUT IT THAT IT KIND OF THAT THAT PERSPECTIVE KIND OF IGNORES REALITY THAT THERE IS NO QUESTION BUTA SHUTTERS THAT- HAVE SERVED- STUDENTS WELL AND THE FACT THAT NOW WE'RE IN THE POST PANDEMIC WORLD WHERE A LOT OF PARENTS PROBABLY WANT TO KEEP THEIR KIDS IN A CLASS BUT COULD NOT QUESTION BAY STARTER SO. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHY THAT MORATORIUM IS NECESSARY. SO CERTAINLY I THINK YOU KNOW IT AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN A RETURN JUNE- IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. WHICH IS YOU KNOW GENERALLY CLASSROOM BASED- ARE AND HAVE BEEN THE DEFAULT OPTION FOR MOST OF. OUR INSTITUTIONS ROUTE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. OKAY I MEAN I DON'T BELIEVE THE POINT THAT YOU JUST GAVE ME THE SAME ANSWER DID BEFORE SO. I'M NOT SURE THAT QUITE ADDRESS- THE HEART OF MY QUESTION BUT- I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE. BECAUSE I THINK. LOOK PARENTS WANT THEIR KIDS IN SAFE ENVIRONMENTS AND BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC THEY MOVED THEIR KIDS INTO NON CLASSROOM BASED ENVIRONMENTS. AND SO WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THOSE PARENTS- AS WELL. IN TERMS OF JUST THE BIG- THE BROAD DISCUSSION THERE IS A AND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ONE TIME FUNDING FOR ONGOING PROGRAMS- WHAT IS THE PAYMENTS FINANCE WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES PERSPECTIVE ON HOW DO YOU ADDRESS. CONTINUING THAT FUNDING INTO THE FUTURE ONCE THE ONE TIME FUNDING IS UP IS EXHAUSTED. CERTAINLY DEPENDING UPON THE PARTICULAR ALLOCATION THEIR EXTENDED- EXPENDITURE ENCUMBRANCE STATES TO ALLOW. THOSE FUNDS TO BE USED OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD- AND CERTAINLY AS YOU KNOW THE BUDGET BELT IN FUTURE YEARS WE WILL NOW CONTINUE TO OF REVIEW AVAILABLE RESOURCE. OKAY- CERTAINLY THERE AT THAT THAT'S A CONCERN- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT YOU QUITE THAT I GOT TO THAT HE LANDED THAT ONE EITHER BUT I'M JUST- IT CERTAINLY CONCERNED THAT ONCE THE ONE TIME FUNDING IS- IS GONE FOR THESE ONGOING PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LEFT- KIND OF STRUGGLING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO NEXT I AND THAT LEADS ME I GUESS SINCE YOU-JUMPING TO S. B. ONE SIXTY ONE- CERTAINLY THE SIGNIFICANT ITEM THERE IS- WELFARE FUNDING. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS MEASURE TAKES THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WAS. IT THAT IS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AND ARE IN THAT WAS. PROPOSED TO BE AND- NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET AND MAKES IT AVAILABLE FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION THIS YEAR SO WHAT CRITERIA WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT FUNDING IS GOING TO BE EXPENDED. ASSEMBLY JUST CLARIFY BECAUSE I THINK I GOT SOME MORE CLEAR FOR CLOSURE SO ACTUALLY DISTRICTS SO- ON. THERE THERE WAS I THINK CONFUSION ABOUT THE ONE BILLION THAT WAS DONE IN AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT. SO FOR OVER TWO YEARS SO THE ONE BILLION OVER TWO YEARS IS STILL. BEING DONE THE DIFFERENCE IS WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO WORK ON A DEAL BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF SESSION AND FOR THIS COMING BUDGET YEAR. IN THAT DEAL WILL BE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND- UNDERSTANDING WORD WORD BEEN AND- BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- WITH THE IDEA THAT THROUGH THE REMAINDER WHAT. WE'RE GOING TO YEAR TOO SO IT'S STILL A BILLION OVER TWO YEARS WE'RE STILL WORKING OUT THOSE DETAILS I THINK THAT'S WHY. THEY ARE CONTINUING TO BE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. I WAS OBVIOUSLY MEMBERS HAVE YOU KNOW FEEDBACK CONCERNS THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO. DISCUSS SO FEEL FREE TO KEEP TALKING TO US ABOUT THE NUMBER OF THE TOUGHEST INCORPORATE THAT INTO ROOMS THANK ACTUALLY OKAY I MIGHT IF I IF I COULD ASK MISTER CHAIR CLARIFY- SAID THE- THERE'S GONNA BE THE DISCUSSION IS GOING TO THE RANGE IS GOING TO BE. BETWEEN TWO FIFTY EIGHT AND SEVEN FIFTY. FOUR UP FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS NO DOUBT FOR NEXT YEAR FOR NEXT YEAR YEAH OKAY FOR THIS FOR THIS BUDGET YEAR THAT WE ARE. PASSING A BUDGET. OKAY SO THIS BUDGET YEAR THAT WE ALREADY ENTERED OKAY SO THIS EXAM IS ONE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT THAT THE TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY BUDGET THERE'S GOING THERE'S DISCUSSIONS ONGOING OF. A BUMPING THAT. AMOUNT APPROPRIATED TO SEVEN FIFTY NINE. THE TEMPERATURE BIRDS WOULD STILL BE A- FOR THE TWO YEARS. SO DON'T GO CHRISTIAN. YEAH COULD SOMEONE FROM THOMAS FROM TRY THIS YEAR HELLO SORRY I HAD THE WRONG OKAY THANK THERE TO. HIMSELF AT WELL WHEN I HIT THE BUT NOT THIS ONE- OKAY SO THEY ANY TO THE TO FINE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SEX THERE'S TWO MILLION. A TEACHER FUNDING WE MAKES UP THE BALANCE OF THE DOLLARS SO THAT'S PART OF THAT THEY DO HERE IS AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT WAS SORT OF A TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GENERAL FUND VERSES. GRF SO THAT'S THAT'S PART OF WHY THERE'S A DIFFERENCE SO COULD COULD YOU JUST- THEN PROVIDE IN THIS THIS FISCAL YEAR. HOW MUCH WILL BE. DISCUSSED HOW MUCH IS BEING DISCUSSED TO BE ALLOCATED IN THIS FISCAL YEAR ADDED GENERAL FUND AND HOW MUCH IS BEING DISCUSSED AT A TEACHER AT. IF YOU COULD. IF YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT. SO INTHE IN ONE TWENTY NINE THERE IS SOME TEACHER EFFORTS AT THE TOP I HAD I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT AMOUNT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT IN. ONE TWENTY ON ALREADY. HAS OTHERS THE BALANCE OF THAT FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR IT'S UP TO THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR. AND THEN IN ADDITION WORDS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A RANGE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY. EIGHT MILLION TO SEVEN OR FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND. HOW WHICH WOULD BE ON THE TABLE IN TERMS OF ARCHITECTURE THAT WE JUST DESIGNED IN THE BUDGET AGREEMENT FOR DISCUSSION ABOUT. HOW THAT MONEY SHOULD BE FUNDED AND WHEN THAT MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT IT BASED ON. HOW FAST OF THE MONEY THAT WE'VE ALREADY PUT OUT. WHICH MEMBER WE PUT UP THE EARLY ACTION MONEY THAT WAS ONLY. TOO HAPPY MONTHS AGO THREE MONTHS AGO SO WE KIND OF LOOKING AT THAT. IT'S A WE GET BACK FROM SUMMER RECESS- AS- AS YOU REQUESTED THERE'S- GOING TO BE HEARING ON WILDFIRES WILL GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT. AND BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE EXPANSION LEVELS ARE AND WHERE IT WILL BE APPROPRIATE. TO PUT FUNDING AND WHERE THE NEEDS ARE SO THAT THE MONEY'S BEST USE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A GREAT NEED. FOR SURE. SO I PUTS THE BY BY I'M GLAD THAT THAT THE OVERSIGHT HEARING IS GOING TO BE- THERE'S GONNA TAKE PLACE I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED THAT. THAT TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY TO KNOW- WHAT THE CAPACITY IS AND WHAT'S BEING DONE. FOR SURE- BUT I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO WRAP MY HANDS AROUND THE FACT THAT WE- HOPE. AS WE DISCUSS THIS- THIS BILL. WHAT HOW MUCH MONEY IS. IT SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S UP TO SEVEN FIFTY MILLION FOR THIS. FISCAL BUT THIS THIS CURRENT BUDGET. SO THIS IS JUST THE ARCHITECTURE IN WHICH WE'VE SORT OF BUILT THIS BUDGET PACKAGE IN TERMS OF THE ASSUMPTIONS OVERALL AND SO THAT WE WHEN WE DID BILL THAT WE HAVE THESE THIS ASSUMPTION ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE WOULD SPEND ON THIS WHICH WAS IN ONE TWENTY EIGHT. AND THEN ONE TWENTY NINE WAS SORT OF AN R. FLEXION OF HOW MUCH WE THOUGHT WOULD BE IN THIS FISCAL VERSUS PEOPLE SO THIS IS TRYING TO RESET THE CONVERSATION TO A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS BEEN BILLION DOLLARS. LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE TO SPEND I GOTCHA I THINK I'M I THINK WE MAY BE CONFUSING PEOPLE EVEN MORE SO I UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S THE INTENT HERE IS TO YOU KNOW THAT. THIS THIS ENTIRE CONTROL SECTION IS ABOUT. FUTURE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE BUDGET. IT'S NOT ACTUALLY. THE ACTUAL PROPOSALS WE HAVE TO COME BACK. AFTER THAT. AND HAVE A CONVERSATION ABSOLUTE SO THEN WILL. IN IN TERMS OF WHAT'S BEING NEGOTIATED. NOW OR WHAT WE WERE NEGOTIATING. THAT THAT I CAN'T THAT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. IS UP TO SEVEN FIFTY MILLION. THAT IS SET ASIDE RIGHT NOW SO IS THAT RIGHT YEAH OKAY- OKAY THAT THAT'S WHERE I DIDN'T A PART OF WHAT WE'RE DETERMINING PROBABLE CAUSE AND THAT DETERMINATION. ACTUALLY WHAT CAN BE SPENT RIGHT SO I THINK IT'S ALSO TRYING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND- THAT THAT'S A KEY COMPONENT IS WHAT'S WHAT REALISTICALLY COULD BE SPENT ON ESTRADA. SAID THEN IF I COULD FOLLOW UP ON ON THAT THAT- AT THE NUMBERS AND IF THE IF THE GOAL IS A BILLION DOLLARS. I'M ASSUMING A GRAPHIC AND THAT IS ASSUMING BOTH GENERAL FUND AND EUROPE TOGETHER CORRECT- DOES SO IF THE SEVEN FIFTY IS JUST GENERAL FUND. DOES THAT MEAN AND IN YOUR ATTIC ARE YOU ADDING TWO HUNDRED MILLION. I DID YEAR AFTER THAT HE GETS A ONE BILLION. CORRECT AND IN ADDITION THERE'S SOME G. DRAFT THAT'S ALREADY IN AB ONE TWENTY NINE THAT'S FOUR FIVE FIRES THERE'S A LITTLE BIT THERE WHICH UP GET OFF TOM HEADED OUT FROM THE EXACT AMOUNT SO. IT'S ROUGH ABC COMES I THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BILLION TOTAL FUNDS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE THEM LOT- SO- IN GENERAL THAT BUT THE IDEA AGAIN IS THAT THAT'S WHAT THE ASSUMPTION IS FOR THE ARCHITECTURE FOR THE CONVERSATION BUT WE HAVE TO COME BACK AND HAVE A CONVERSATION I DON'T THINK WE'RE NOT. REALLY GOING TO BE. LIKE FOUNDED IN EXACTLY BY THOSE NUMBERS WE HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT MAKES SENSE BASED ON THE HEARING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WE GET BACK. ATTACHED SO. THAT I AM I'M ASSUMING THEN THAT WILL. FLOW I SHOULD ASSUME. SB ONE TWENTY NINE IS NOT SIGNED INTO LAW YET SO ARE WE ANTICIPATING THAT THAT WILL BE SIGNED INTO LAW. AND THEN WE'RE AMENDING BETWEEN NINE. THE GOVERNOR HAS WILL YOU BE AMENDED YOU BE WE WOULD BE AMENDING AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT. THE GOVERNOR HAS UNTIL JULY TWELFTH TO SIGN OR VETO- SB ONE TWENTY NINE. OKAY AND THIS BILL AB ONE AB IN SB ONE SIXTY ONE ENVISIONS THE GOVERNOR SIGNING ONE TWENTY. OKAY BECAUSE THIS DOG SO THEN THIS. SB ONE SIXTY ONE. A MAN. SB ONE THREE NINE. IS THAT CORRECT BUT AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE SOON TO BE OR COULD BE SIGNED. AT ANY TIME BUT- WE'RE ASSUMING. THAT IS IN LAW. INDOLENT AS WE DISCUSSED THIS YEAH. BUT THE- AS THE MEASURE THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. IT THAT THAT THE IDEA IS. OBVIOUSLY WHAT ONCE WE- ARE ABLE TO AGREE HAVE AN AGREEMENT THEN ALL THE CREAM IT WOULD REPLACE THESE ASSUMPTIONS OKAY SO THAT WOULD BE. LATER THIS THAT WOULD BUDGET JUNIOR JUNIOR JUNIOR THAT WOULD BE THE BUDGET FOUR POINT OH FIVE POINT OH MAYBE OKAY FOR A COMPUTER. OKAY SO- I APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE- I THINK THAT. IS THE GOAL THEN IS WITH DESIGNERS AND ONE BILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. BUT WE'RE NOT WE WANT TO FRONT LOAD AS MUCH MONEY INTO THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR- WITH THE IT WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE GET FROM OVERSIGHT HEARING TO WHAT THE CAPACITY IS. I WOULD REDEFINE GOAL AS THE BUDGET AGREEMENT SET ASIDE RESOURCES FOR BILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS FOR WILDFIRES AND SO IT'S A YOU KNOW BASICALLY FOR CONVERSATION WHEN WE GET BACK ON WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THAT BILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS NOT THE- END OF THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT THAT'S JUST WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS BUDGET AGREEMENT FOR JUNE AND JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE OKAY. SO FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS CONVERSATION THEN WITH WITH- SB ONE SIXTY ONE. IT IS IT IS- TWO FIFTY EIGHT. PLUS THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WHAT WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. THE SO WE WOULD BE WE WHAT WE'RE DEBATING AND WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE POSSIBLE WILDFIRE- PACKAGE BEING DISCUSSED THAT THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATING SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT MILLION FOR THIS. FISCAL YEAR. GENERAL FUND CREDIT OFTEN GENERAL FUND AND THEN AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE TWO HUNDRED MILLION. POTENTIALLY DISCUSSED ENERGY HERE IF WE WERE GOING TO ABIDE BY THE- BY THAT THE OBJECTIVES OF SB NINE A ONE. IN THE PAST IT JUST FOR ME TO CLARIFY IS THAT APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SO I THINK THE ACTUAL NUMBER SEVEN FORTY EIGHT FOR LACK OF A BETTER THAN FORTY CLASSIFICATION. OKAY SO I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT THAT THAT. IS VERY HELPFUL- I THINK FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND MAYBE THIS NOW WITH THIS CLARIFICATION IS INFORMATION. MY QUESTION THAT FORMER FINANCE IS. UNDERSTANDING OF THIS NEGOTIATION THAT'S HAPPENING FOR AT SEVEN FORTY MILLION- WOOD THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE AMENABLE TO ALLOWING IF THERE IS A CAPACITY CHALLENGED FROM CAL FIRE TO ALLOW- FIRE SAFE COUNCILS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GPAS NONPROFITS TO BE ABLE TO FIRE MAY NOT HAVE CAPACITY TO DO THAT PART OF THE CONVERSATION. YEAH THIS IS STEPHEN BENSON DEPARTMENT FINANCE. YES THAT'S THAT'S- SO IF YOU'RE CONSERVING BACK A LITTLE BIT SO IF YOU RECALL THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE THAT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION THAT WAS APPROVED BACK IN APRIL. WITH THAT PLAN AND IT IS IT ALLOCATED SPECIFIC AMOUNTS TO DEPARTMENTS AND PROGRAMS. THAT TYPE OF ALLOCATION IS WHAT IS YET TO BE DONE. FOR THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION THAT'S IN THE BUDGET FRAMEWORK. AND IT WAS JUST TALK ABOUT. SO WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK WELL I ASSUME WILL BE CONSIDERING THE SAME PROGRAM THE SAME DEPARTMENTS- WITHIN THAT THERE ARE PORTIONS OF THAT FUNDING THAT GO OUT IN TERMS OF GRANTS TO ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF GROUPS AND THEY'LL AND THEY WILL BE DOING PROJECTS ARE DOING PROJECTS NOW WITH THEIR THE ACTION FUNDING IN IT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE. PART OF A CONVERSATION FOR FUNDING TO FLOW TO THEM TO CONTINUE PROJECTS SURE. I THINK MY ONLY. OUR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT. WE'RE IN THE THROES OF- OF- WILDFIRE SEASON RIGHT NOW. SO IF THERE IS. PROJECTS IF THERE ARE- FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NONPROFIT SECOND DO ADDITIONAL WORK NOW. I WOULD HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT WAITING TO ALLOCATE THE TWO FIFTY EIGHT. WE WOULD BE EXPANDING. THAT MONEY NOW TO DO MORE WORK NOW. SO THE WAY THAT THE BUDGET IS CURRENTLY CRAFTED- ALL OF THIS FUNDING IS IN CONTROL SECTION OR SECTION NINETEEN POINT FIVE FIVE. AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SEND ANY MONEY THAT MANY OF THAT MONEY OUT UNTIL FUTURE LEGISLATION- ADOPTS AN ALLOCATION OF THAT ONE OKAY SO THAT'S ONLY INCUMBENT UPON US FOR SURE SO I HAVE THE PHONE YOU'RE A BUT YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE FIVE THIRTY SIX THAT WAS THAN IT REALLY ACTION ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN EXPENDED. IT I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT ACCOUNTING FOR HOW MUCH IS OUT THE DOOR RIGHT NOW BUT YES THAT IS IN THE ACTIVE- ACTIVELY GOING OUT THE DOOR. AND I THINK IN SOME CASES DEPARTMENTS HAVE FULLY ALLOCATED IN THE WARD SOME OF IT OTHERS PROBABLY ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS. SO WITH THE- THE TWO FIFTY EIGHT THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING AND THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AT A GENERAL FUND- IS THE ADMINISTRATION OPEN TO DOING SOME SECRET FORMER STREAM. AT ATTACHING THAT TO IT TOO TO ALLOW MORE THAT MONEY TO. TO GO FURTHER. AND TO DO MORE PROJECTS. SO THE WAY THAT WE ARE ENVISIONING IT RIGHT NOW IS ONCE AN ALLOCATION PLAN IS THIS IS A GREEN TO AND- ENACTED THROUGH THE FUTURE LEGISLATION THAT'S ANTICIPATED. THEN WHAT WE WOULD DO IS AS- AS DEPARTMENTS WORK THROUGH THEIR PORTION OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION. AND THEY'RE READY TO ACCESS THEIR PORTION OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WE WOULD START MAKING THAT FIVE THAT THOSE PORTIONS AVAILABLE TO THOSE DEPARTMENTS. WE JUST EXPECT WE EXPECTED THAT- THE RATE THROUGH WHICH- SOME PORTIONS OF THAT ARE USED WILL DIFFER FROM DEPARTMENT TO DEPARTMENT FROM PROGRAM TO PROGRAM. OKAY I THINK THAT MY MAIN POINT IS THAT. WE WANT TO SUPPLEMENT AND COMPLEMENT WHAT CALIFORNIA'S DOING CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT ON THEIR PLATE. AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S CAPACITY CHALLENGES. I THINK THAT- FOR US AS A LEAD TO THE BODY. I AM FOR THOSE TO REPRESENT- FIRE REGIONS- ARE FIRE PRONE REGIONS WE HAVE ORGANIZATIONS THAT. ARE WILLING TO DO THE WORK NOW THAT HAVE THEY HAVE EXTRA CAPACITY. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. THAT THOSE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS BE MORE ROBUST- TO ALLOW MORE WORK MORE ACRES TO BE TREATED MORE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT TO BE DONE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M ENCOURAGING- AND MBANK KIND OF IMPLORING AND PLEADING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO. IS TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN- AND OF COURSE- YOU KNOW THERE ARE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS IRONICALLY IN- THE EDUCATION- TRAILER BILL THAT WE DISCUSSED SO. WHY NOT. PUSH FOR CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION- FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. IT RIGHT NOW IN IN IN THIS IN THIS CURRENT BUT THE SCHOOL YEAR OR IN THE ND IN THIS TRAILER BILLS WAS THAT IT OR IS THAT PART OF THE DISCUSSION IN THE- YEAH AND IN THE WHILE FIRED NEGOTIATIONS. IS TO ACTUALLY PUT IN A CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS. SINCE THE TWO THINGS I'LL TAKE UP THERE SO WHAT ONE OF THE PILLARS TO THE WILDFIRE ACTION PLAN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS WERE REBELS AROUND IS ACTUALLY IS A REGIONAL COLLABORATIONS TO BUILD AND REGIONAL SCALE WILDFIRE TREATMENT OF LANDS. AND SO THAT IS A MAJOR COMPONENT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE AND ANY EARLY ACTION AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING WITH THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IS GETTING THAT INTO SO DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION RUNS REGIONAL- PROGRAM THAT HELPS TO GET PROJECTS SET UP ON A REGIONAL SCALE. FUNDING WENT OUT TO CONSERVANCY SO THEY COULD WORK ON A REGIONAL SCALE PROJECTS THAT'S ALL PART OF- THE WELFARE ACTION PLANS ALL PART OF THIS CONVERSATION THE ALLOCATIONS THAT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING. MATTERS WITH THE STRONG PILLARS OF THE ACTUAL PLAN IN TERMS OF THE CONTINUOUS PREPARATION QUESTION THAT'S MORE OF A BUDGET FRAMEWORK BUDGET ARCHITECTURE QUESTION- I SITE YOU KNOW. ALL I CAN REALLY SAY ON THAT IS WHEN THE BUDGET WAS DISCUSSED AND NEGOTIATED- THE INDIANS FRIENDMARK THE STRUCTURE THAT WE LANDED ON. WEST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION WITH FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND THIS LANGUAGE IS TO ALLOW US TO ALLOCATE THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. IF PROJECTS MOVE AT A PACE THAT DEMONSTRATE. THE NEED TO HAVE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAIL NOW IS. OKAY WELL I WANT TO BE THE POINT HAD OUR- DISK ROBUST DISCUSS I THINK THAT. I THINK WHAT YOU'VE JUST ENDED NO WHAT YOU SAID. I THINK IS. ACTUALLY WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR A WAY A FOR A ALL OF US ALL OF US IN WELL BY PRONE AREAS ARE AT. FOR A THAT WE WANT MORE CAPACITY WE WANT MORE REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WE WANT MORE MONEY AND WE WANT MORE CONTINUOUS PREPARATION. AND WE NEED WE NEED TO STREAMLINING TO DO SO BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING FIRES IN OUR REGION RIGHT NOW I MEAN THEY'VE BEEN TO FIRES. IN THE KERN COUNTY REGION- AND THEN OF COURSE- OF ELEVEN OR SO FIRES I THINK TO A STATEWIDE SO- YOU KNOW WE'VE WE ARE SEEING WE ARE DEBATING. WE'RE REVIEWING RIGHT NOW CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS. FOR OTHER TRAILER BILLS. MY THAT'S HAPPENED SO THE- YOU CAN SAY THAT WE CAN'T DO IT CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS BECAUSE- UNDER SB ONE THIRTY. THERE ARE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS IN THERE. FOR IMPORTANT THINGS- CERTAINLY IN THE EDUCATION SPACE. WHAT WE'RE ARGUING- IS THAT WILDFIRE PREVENTION IS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT TO AND SO WE NEED TO DO IS A PREPARATIONS FOR THAT AS WELL SO WITH THAT THEY CAN SECURE FOR ADOPTION. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER. THANK YOU MISTER FLIPS YOU HEAR ME. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS FOR A BILL HOUSE AFFECT THE ABILITY OF YOU SEE HOSPITALS TO MODERNIZE OR MAKE SEISMIC RETROFITS TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE- I BELIEVE THAT THE- TRAILER BILL DOESN'T SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THAT ASPECT. THAT SAID HE'S HE GENERALLY USES REVENUE BONDS TO SUPPORT THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES AND OR YOU KNOW OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THEY MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE AND- ON THE HEALTH SIDE. SO HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM SB EIGHT TWENTY WHICH WAS SIGNED THE LAW LAST YEAR REQUIRES YOU SEE TO CERTIFY ANNUALLY TO DEAL LEFT. THAT BUILDINGS BUILT TO THE STATE FOR A CAPITAL OUTLAY PROCESS- BEING OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY YOU SEE EMPLOYEES. APOLOGIES I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR- COMMENT SO CERTAINLY THIS BILL MAKES- BURKE PROPOSES CHANGES TO THAT PROCESS- BUT YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE I WOULD SAY. THAT YOU KNOW THE CHANGES WERE DESIGNED TO CAPTURE ADDITIONAL FACILITIES- CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES PLACED IN THE BILL- BUT I WOULD JUST LIMIT MY COMMENTS IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THAT. LANGUAGE DOES AS OPPOSED TO- YOU KNOW ANY PARTICULAR- COMMENTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON OF THE TERM OF THAT. LINE MISTER PERFECT QUESTIONS WELL OKAY IF YOU ANSWERED THANK YOU. YEAH MARC MARTIN WITH THE BUDGET COMMITTEE- SO THE LANGUAGE IN QUESTION I THINK YOU'RE REFERENCING LAST YEAR'S CHRISTIAN IT YES LANGUAGE SO THAT ADDED A CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR YOU SEE. TO CERTIFY THAT THEY WERE NOT. OUTSOURCING WORKERS THE LANGUAGE IN QUESTION NOW FURTHER DEFINES THAT CERTIFICATION PROCESS. SO IT SORT OF BUILDS ON LAST YEAR'S LINE OKAY IN THE IN THE REASON THE REASON I BUILT ON LAST YEAR'S IS BECAUSE THAT THE UNIVERSITY APPEARS TO HAVE IGNORED LAST YEAR'S LAST YEAR'S LANGUAGE OKAY SO THIS IS A FOLLOW UP HELLO THIS LANGUAGE DIFFERENT FROM A POLICY PROHIBITING CONTRACTING WORK APPROVED BY THE UC RAGE REGENTS- REASONS POLICY FIFTY FOUR OH TWO. WELL I THINK THE- THE LANGUAGE STRENGTHENS THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS. THAT YOU SEE DIDN'T DO THIS YEAR THAT WE WHAT THEY WERE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE A REPORT ON FEBRUARY FIRST WE RECEIVED A REPORT ON JUNE ELEVENTH WHICH DID SHOW THIRTY TWO EXAMPLES OF YOU SEE OUTSOURCING WORK. SO THIS LANGUAGE IS A MORE- JUST MORE DETAILED PROCESS FOR THEM TO CERTIFY THAT THEY ARE NOT VIOLATING THE REGION'S POLICY. AND THE STATE LAW THAT ALREADY- REQUIRES YOU SEE TO USE ITS OWN WORKFORCE IN STATE FUNDED BUILDING. THANK YOU FOR. MISS FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF- INCLUDE ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES POSSIBLY. IS MR WELL FUNDED TALKED ABOUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT- ACCESSING OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR OF WILDFIRE PREVENTION OR SUPPRESSION- WHY ARE WE TALKING TO THE UTILITIES WHO ALREADY ARE ENGAGED. INTO THE AREAS- THAT OF RESPONSIBILITY THEY ALREADY HAVE A MOMENTUM IF THEY COULD LEVERAGE STATE DOLLARS ALSO FOR THEIR PROGRAMS. ALSO SOME OF THE LARGER TIMBER COMPANIES WHO. WHO HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN TO BEING- PROACTIVE ON THIS. FRONT TOO SO THE ONLY FIRE SAFE COUNCILS BUT ALSO OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE ALREADY ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THEIR RESOURCES AND GET A GREATER GAME WITH INVESTMENT FROM THE STATE. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT. THE OTHER THING IS- JUST ON THE SPECIAL EDUCATION FRONT- NO SURPRISE HERE LET ME ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS- WHAT ARE WE- WHAT IS DETERMINING THIS AMOUNTS THAT I SEIZE UP. IN THE SEPARATE COLUMNS- THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES. FOR THE STUDENTS THAT DID ACTUALLY REGRESS FROM NOT BEING ABLE TO DISTANCE LEARN. AND YOU KNOW THE WIND INTO A COMPLETE KIND OF A THE CYCLE BEHAVIORAL ISSUES HOW ARE WE GOING TO ASSESS. EXCESS ON THIS NUMBER ONE AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I DID NOTICE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. WHEN I DID GO INTO SOME OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSES WAS THERE WAS A KIND OF A OF. A BUNDLING OF STUDENTS. OF FROM LIKE MAYBE K. TWO FOUR. AND SO. THEY WERE GETTING A KIND OF AN ECONOMY OF SCALE WITH HER PROFESSIONALS AND OR THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER WERE. A LOT OF THE KIDS THROUGH THEIR ASSESSMENTS NEEDED MORE INDIVIDUALIZED IEP KIND OF YOU KNOW OF. TREATMENT NOT TREATMENT BUT YOU KNOW INSTRUCTION. AND SO. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE'VE BEEN NOW THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND THEN THERE'S REGRESSION AND THEN IF THEY'RE THAT SAME PATTERN OF BUNDLING STUDENTS GOES FORWARD. HOW DO WE- YOU KNOW. HOW DO WE ADVANCE HOW DO WE HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD SO. I WAS HOPING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT AND CONCENTRATE BECAUSE AGAIN- YOU KNOW IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE PROVIDE SUCCESS FOR THESE STUDENTS ALSO- AND THE MORE THAT WE TIME IT WE INVEST THAT THE BETTER OUTCOMES WE HALF. AND SO I'M JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO YOU KNOW DISCUSSION ON THAT TOO BUT I DO APPRECIATE. THE RECOGNITION THAT YOU KNOW THERE WAS A DESPERATE NEED FOR HELP IN THIS ARENA AND CRESCENTA I DO UNDERSTAND YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND I APPRECIATE IT. THANK MISCONDUCT. OKAY YEAH I HAVE A FEW OBVIOUSLY GOT THREE THREE PRETTY BIG TRAILER BILLS HERE- BUT I'LL START WITH THE WILDFIRES DISCUSSION- I HEARD A LOT OF THINGS IN THERE THAT I JUST DON'T THINK YOU'RE- RIGHT ACCURATE- FIRST OF ALL. EARLY ACTION FUNDING THAT WE PASSED EARLIER THIS YEAR A BIG CHUNK OF THAT MONEY PAID FOR MONEY WE WERE SUPPOSED TO EXPAND LAST YEAR. OKAY SO THAT'S JUST DOING WHAT YOU WERE WHAT YOU DIDN'T DO. LAST YEAR AND PART OF WHAT THEY'RE TELLING YOU THE BACKLOG IS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DO THAT LAST YEAR YOUR SPENDING THAT MONEY THIS YEAR THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE LAST YEAR. AND WHY DID WE DO LAST YEAR LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE GIGI R. F. CAP AND TRADE DID NOT PRODUCE ENOUGH REVENUE. OR THE ANTICIPATED REVENUE THAT WE- THAT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD. IN OUR RESPONSE OR AT LEAST THE A MINUTE THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE WAS LET'S NOT BACK FILL THAT WOULD GENERAL FUND MONEY. LET'S NOT MAKE WILD FIRE PREVENTION A PRIORITY. THE MONEY'S NOT THERE FROM GIGI R. F. SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND IT. THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE AND A PROBLEM. AND WE SHOULD BE ALL ABOUT REMEDY IN NOW TO MAKING SURE THAT WE MAKE THIS RIGHT THAT THIS WE SHOULD NOT TO FIGHT EVERY YEAR ABOUT. PUTTING MONEY INTO WILDFIRE PREVENTION IT SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC LIKE PROP NINETY EIGHT. SHOULD BE. I MEAN AFTER THESE FIVE YEARS THE FIRES. UP AND DOWN THE STATE'S SMOKE FILLING ORDER. IBM CARBON EMISSIONS GOALS JUST BLOWN OUT OF THE WATER WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT AN AUTOMATIC PRIORITY EVERY YEAR THAT'S THE PROBLEM OKAY. SO EARLY ACTION MONEY DON'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU DID THAT'S WHAT HE'S MAKING UP FOR WHAT YOU DIDN'T DO. OKAY NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS YEAR AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT BEING A BILLION DOLLARS IS ONLY A BILLION DOLLARS IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY AND MAKE SURE IT'S ALLOCATED TO PROGRAMS AND GET OUT THERE. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS BUDGET IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT IT IS. NOW IN THIS NEW TRAILER BILL. YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE POLITICAL PRESSURE. OR OTHERWISE WROTE US ALL LETTERS. LAST WEEK RIGHT AFTER WAS CALLED OUT THAT HE HASN'T BEEN DOING WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THE ACREAGE THAT HE SAID WE WERE DOING THAT WE DIDN'T SPEND THE MONEY LAST YEAR THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY CUTS TO WILDFIRE PREVENTION SO NOW HE SENDS US A LETTER AND SAYS OKAY GUYS YEAH AND ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION- THEY WERE DEFINITELY GOING TO SPEND. NO GIVE ME ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WILL ACCESS IF WE USE IF WE SAY THAT WE NEED. THAT'S WHAT THIS LANGUAGE SAYS SOME FIVE HUNDRED MILLION NOT NOTHING IS GOING TO ACTUALLY GET SPEND GET OUT THERE AND SEE THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PRESENT- TO ME AS DUPLICITOUS. IT IS DECEPTIVE I THINK YOU JUST WE ARE WE JUST SPENT FIFTEEN MINUTES CLARIFYING WITH MR FONG WHAT THAT MAN YEAH AND I'M GONNA RE CLARIFY IT. I'M IN THE G. CLARIFIED BECAUSE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE THESE ARE THE FACTS. THIS EXTRA FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IS NOT NECESSARILY GOING OUT THERE AT ALL IT'S ONLY IF THIS ADMINISTRATION CALLS FOR. IT'S AGAIN RIGHT IT'S A- PLACEHOLDER UNTIL WE CAN. CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS. TO FINALIZE THE ACTUAL AMOUNT I DON'T KNOW WE NEED TO DECIDE. WHAT YOU WANT SO IF YOU WANT TO BE PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS YOU'RE WELCOME TO IF YOU WANT TO. ADVANCE IT MR CHAIRMAN THAT'S NOT FAIR I HAVE I HAVE SECOND YOUR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS ARE UNFAIR EITHER AT THE TIME SAYING THEY AREN'T. GOING TO WE JUST. NO THEY'RE NOT I'M NOT GONNA LET PEOPLE LIE TO THE PEOPLE WE'RE WE'RE NOT REALLY BEING DONE. I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN TODAY NO. AND SO ALL I'M SAYING IS I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WHAT I'M SAYING IS IF YOU IF YOU WANNA BE PART OF THE PROCESS YOU WANT TO. WORK AND BE PART OF IT THAT'S GREAT. IF YOU DON'T WANT P. GO AHEAD CONTINUE ON. OKAY I WANT TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS AND SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. I INTRODUCED A BILL. THEY WOULD HAVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION FOR FIVE YEARS AND A SEQUEL EXEMPTION WHICH IS THE OTHER THING THAT CAL. WHY WE HAVE A BACKLOG. TOM PORTER TOLD YOU ON THE ARTICLE. WE HAVE A BACKLOG BECAUSE WE NEED SEEK REFORM WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE MORE PROJECTS. IT'S NOT AS EASY AS WAVING A MAGIC WAND TO GO DO THESE PROJECTS YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH THIS BURDENSOME PROCESS HE SAID THAT. PUBLICLY IN THE PAPER. WE SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION THAT IS OUR C. CORE FORM IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL I DON'T KNOW WE'RE CHANGING POLICY THAT YOU SEE. WE CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO DO A SEQUEL EXEMPTION IN THIS TRAILER BILL THAT'S THE OTHER PROBLEM. SO I'VE BEEN A PART OF THIS PROCESS AND I'VE SENT YOU LETTERS WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS. I'VE CONTINUALLY SO WHAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE DONE. ON THIS ISSUE. I'M SORRY JUST IT'S JUST THAT IT'S NOT GETTING DONE. AND WE KEEP ACTING LIKE IT IS WE DIDN'T SPEND THE MONEY LAST YEAR THAT'S TRUE. WE MADE UP FOR EARLY ACTION THAT'S TRUE. AND NOW WE GOT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION THAT IS DEFINITELY CONFIRMED. FOR THIS BUDGET YEAR. AND WHAT AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE NEED TO NEGOTIATE ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO NEGOTIATE MORE ABOUT IT'S EITHER A PRIORITY IS NOT. PUT IT IN THE BUDGET. JUST PUT IT IF IT'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION GREAT PUT IT IN THERE. DON'T SAY IS DEPENDENT ON WHETHER OR NOT THE SAME ADMINISTRATION WHO HASN'T BEEN DOING THE WORK. AND WHO PREVIOUSLY SAID- WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY. WE'RE GOING TO RELY ON THEM TO ASK FOR THE MONEY LATER IN THE YEAR THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE GOOD ACCOUNTABILITY TO ME. AND THAT IS WHY I THINK WE NEED CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION. THAT ENSURES THIS MONEY'S GONNA GET SPENT AND WE NEED TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO CAPACITY. ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES A SEQUEL. AND I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS BECAUSE I'M GONNA BRING AN AMENDMENT AGAIN. AND ASK YOU ALL TO VOTE FOR IT. TO MAKE THE CHANGE THAT WE ALL KNOW NEEDS TO BE DONE. THAT'S THE END OF THE WILDFIRE DISCUSSION THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY AFTER TODAY. I'M NOT GONNA GO ASK A QUESTION SO I CAN HEAR MORE OBFUSCATION. FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NOW MOVING INTO OUR HIGHER ED. SB ONE THIRTY TWO. THE PROBLEM HERE AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY THIS QUESTION IS WE'RE TRYING. I THOUGHT WE ALL BELIEVE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. I THOUGHT WE BELIEVED IN THAT WE BELIEVE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. BECAUSE IF WE DO THEN WHY ARE WE TRYING TO IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL. MESS WITH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BETWEEN THE US BETWEEN THE UC AND ASKED ME THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE LEVERAGING UP CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS THAT NEED TO GET DONE. NOW WE ALL KNOW NEED TO BE DONE AT OUR AT OUR UC'S. AND LEVERAGING THEM INSANE UNLESS YOU REALLY MEET THE DEMANDS THAT'S GOING ON IN THIS THERE'S ALREADY A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH ASK ME THERE'S ALREADY A POLICY. THAT SAYS THEY CAN'T DO. THEY CAN'T CONTRACT OUT. FOR THESE OTHER SERVICES. AND WE'RE ENTERING INTO IT INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO CONTINUE AND THE AND THE CONTRACT IS ALREADY IN PLACE TO CONTINUE. AND MORE DANGEROUSLY HOLDING UP PROJECTS ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE DONE YEAH YOU SEE. TO THE TUNE OF SEVEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. AN ACTIVE PROJECTS THAT NEED TO GET BILL. THEY'RE GONNA PUT ALSO BY THE WAY THEY'RE GOING TO PUT PEOPLE TO WORK. DOING THOSE MUCH NEEDED PROJECTS. AND BE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AND BE A GOOD FOR THOSE WORKERS WHY ARE WE DOING THIS I MEAN THIS BILL I GUESS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HEARD TOMORROW I HOPE IT DOESN'T GET HURT AT ALL. IS THIS IS EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG I MEAN IF YOU IF WE REALLY GOING TO SAY I BELIEVE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING YOU SHOULD NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL. YOU'RE TRYING TO INTERFERE WITH THE PROCESS AND YOU'RE HOLDING UP MUCH NEEDED PROJECTS. IN ORDER TO DO THAT IT'S NOT. IT'S DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE IN A BUDGET TRAILER BILL. AT THE VERY LEAST. EDUCATION BUDGET TRAILER YOU KNOW I I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS HAVE BEEN ON THE BUDGET SUB I THINK WE DID A LOT OF GOOD WORK THIS YEAR I AM CONCERNED- MY SOME OF THESE LAST YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD CALL MORE LAST MINUTE CHANGES- THE FOCUS ON CONCENTRATION GRANTS AND SO JUST HAVING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING AND THAT'S A QUESTION I HAVE I THOUGHT WE WERE ON THAT TRACK OF JUST HAVING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL SCHOOLS. INSTEAD OF JUST FOCUSING ON- CONCENTRATION GRANTS. PLEASE COULD WE SPEAK TO THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE US WOULD YOU LIKE L. L. OR YEAH I KNOW IT'S- EITHER ONE YEAH LET'S LET'S START WITH DAILY- THE LOCAL FINANCE. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SO THAT WAS- ISSUE WHEN THEY WERE VISION HAD PROPOSED- AN INCREASE IN THE CONCENTRATION BROWN'S. OF FUNDING- THE LEGISLATIVE- BUDGET THAT ENDED UP DEAD A FEW WEEKS AGO HAD I KEPT THE SAME TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING BUT ALLOCATED THAT BASEDON- SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS AND THE FINAL- AT THAT THE PACKAGE BEFORE YOU- I THINK IT IS BACK MORE TO. THE NAY REVISION- BUT IN COMPOSED AND I'M A LOOK AT A PRIVATE FINANCE SPEAKING ABOUT THE THEIR- THINKING BEHIND THAT PROPOSAL. CHRIS FERGUSON AGAIN WITH FINANCE- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY UP FOCUSED ON- YOU KNOW THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THE GREATEST NEEDS- AS SUCH YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY WE FOCUSED ON- THE CONCENTRATION GRADIENT. YEAH BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS. THERE ARE MANY SCHOOLS ARE I MEAN LOOK SCHOOLS- EVERY SCHOOL IN THIS STATE HAS KIDS IN IT THAT IT THAT MEET THE CRITERIA OF LOW INCOME- FOSTER CARE OR HAVE- THE THAT MEET THAT CRITERIA THE FOCUSING JUST ON THOSE WHO REACH A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE THRESHOLD OF THOSE KIDS IGNORES ALL THE OTHER KIDS WHO MIGHT BE IN THE SCHOOLS TO. AND THESE OTHER SCHOOLS BUT THEY JUST DON'T MEET THE 55% OR I GUESS IT'S 65% NOW- CONCENTRATION GRANT FORMULA RIGHT I MEAN. HAVING ALL KIDS SUFFERED AND CERTAINLY KIDS AND NOT IN THAT CATEGORY- YOU KNOW LOW INCOME- ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND FOSTER CARE STUDENTS ARE IN EVERY SCHOOL. SO ARE YOU SHORT CHANGING THEM IF YOU ONLY FOCUS ON CONCENTRATION GRANTS- SCHOOLS. NO I THINK YOU KNOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE'RE FOCUSING ON THOSE LEDS WITH THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF YOU KNOW LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENGLISH LANGUAGE. LEARNERS AND FOSTER YOUTH THEY THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN YOU KNOW OUR FOCUS. I'M HOWEVER BUDGET STAFFER REQUIRE FURNISHINGS GUARANTEE ONE FOR FRESH. SURE I WOULD I WOULD JUST REITERATE- WHAT THE ANY BY THE WAY SORRY AARON GABLE SOMETHING BUDGET STAFF- WHAT THE HELL BE ELLIE- WHAT CANCER DEBT- THIS IS THE MAY REVISED PROPOSAL BUT IN ADDITION TO THE CONCENTRATION GRANT BEING INCREASED FOR LCF THAT WE DID DO ALSO THE BASING CREASED OVERALL OF OVER 5% INCREASED ALL ELSE YET BACK WHICH IS. IMPACT SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRANTS WE- HAD OVER A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION INCREASES THAT WERE NOT PART OF THE ME REVISED THE HELPS TO SOFTEN THE INCREASE THE CONCENTRATION GRANT VERSUS OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEN FINALLY ARE ON FINAL EXPANDED LEARNING PACKAGE INCREASES BOTH SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANDPARENTS ACROSS THE BOARD SO WE WERE LOOKING AT THE PACKAGE AS A WHOLE. OKAY SO SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS TO GET INCREASED. IS THAT RIGHT AND. YESTERDAY OUT THERE BEING INCREASED AS A AS A SHARE OF THE BASE OF LCF FAST AND THEN THE- FOR THE EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE AMY ADAMS HELLO FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS I BELIEVE HER SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT ARE UNDUPLICATED STUDENTS FOR EXPANDED LEARNING PURPOSES SO THOSE WERE ON DIFFERENT FORMULAS. OKAY AND THEN THE OTHER CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW THAT WE HAVE NOT PUBLISHED A CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD- TO ME THIS LEAVES ELEAZAR WHO ARE FAILING THEIR STUDENTS IN A HOLDING PATTERN. WITHOUT NECESSARILY INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORT. AND LEAVE STATE POLICY MAKERS LIKE US IN THE POSITION OF ALLOCATING BILLIONS OF LEARNING RECOVERY. FUNDING BASED ON DEMOGRAPHIC ASSUMPTIONS AS OPPOSED TO. ACTUAL STUDENT INCOMES I MEAN BASICALLY ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT WE NEED TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND WAY MORE MONEY GOING OUT THERE THAN EVER BEFORE THAT'S GREAT. BUT THERE STILL NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE'RE REACHING. STUDENT OUT THE OUTCOMES AND METRICS THAT WE WANT FOR OUR STUDENTS YOU KNOW AND AT NOWSM THAT'S GOING TO BE MORE IMPORTANT EVER. BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN LEARNING LOSS THAT THAT HAS OCCURRED. WE'RE GONNA NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE L. E. AS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE. DOING THEIR JOB TO GET IT DONE. BY STUDENTS AND- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY- IN HERE THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY ON INDEPENDENT STUDY AT I APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN. HELPING TO ENSURE THERE'S GOING TO BE IN PERSON. LEARNING BUT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MAKING SURE THAT WERE. ME MATTRESS I THINK IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT- AND LASTLY I MEAN THIS IS ANOTHER ONE YOU WANT- FINANCES TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE- AS MORE OF A STATEMENT I GUESS SO AS OPPOSED TO A QUESTION WELL HOW ABOUT CAN I CAN BECAUSE I MEAN IF YOU'D LIKE TO COULD COULD TARGET DEPARTMENT FINANCE TALK ABOUT WHITE THE DASHBOARD HAS BEEN PUT ON. CERTAINLY I THINK THAT PART OF THE RATIONALE FOR- YOU KNOW THAT. THE DELAY ON THE DASHBOARD IS THAT SOME OF THE UNDERLYING ASSESSMENT- YOU KNOW WERE IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC CAN CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED. SO THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY A TEMPORARY PAUSE THERE THAT SAID- THERE OR THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS. THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE SUPPOSED TO SPEAK TO- YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT OFFERINGS AND THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN THE DIFFERENT SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO STUDENTS. BUT BUT THE CHALLENGE WAS IS THAT WHAT THE ALL CAPS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE DASHBOARD IS BECAUSE- SAY MIKE MORRELL CAPTAIN THINK IT'S TWO HUNDRED PAGES FROM MY DISTRICT SO- EVEN I CAN'T. EVEN I HAVE A HARD TIME DISCERNING THAT THE WHOLE POINT AS- MR GALLAGHER POINT OUT WAS HAVING THIS DASHBOARD WAS TO PROVIDE. ACCOUNTABILITY TO NOT ONLY WE COULD LOOK AT THAT THE PUBLIC COULD LOOK AT SO. WHY WHY HAS A DASHBOARD NOT BEEN PUT UP WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE DO HAVE WE UNDERSTAND THAT. SOMETIMES WHEN I GIVEN LAST YEAR THEY WERE NOT GIVEN THE YEAR BEFORE- BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT WHY WASN'T HE AT LEAST PARTIALLY FILLED OUT. YEAH I THINK GIVEN GIVEN THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT WAS GOING TO BEING PULLED. UP TO BE REPORTED IN THE DASHBOARD- YOU KNOW GIVEN AND THEN. YOU KNOW WORKING OUT WITH A- AND ASSESSMENTS THAT HAVE NOT OCCURRED I'M BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC OR DELAYED BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC- WE FELT IT PRUDENT TO DELAY THE DASHBOARD. SO WHEN YOU PUT UP THE NEXT ASKED WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A GAP OF TWO YEARS. WELL CERTAINLY I'LL I'LL HAPPILY CONNECT WITH. YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUES AT THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO- YOU KNOW GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT PARTICULAR ASPECT GREAT IF THEY CAN RESPOND IN WRITING TO THE COMMITTEE WOULD APPRECIATE IT. JORDAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR THAT- I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT I'M NOT SURE WHY THIS WAS THE CASE- AND PERHAPS TO GET AN ANSWER IS- THE REMOVAL. AT THE SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF AND THE AND THE BLIND IN THE PROGRAM FOR FIVE FOR THE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS- WOULD THINK THAT. THE STUDENTS SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE BUT SOMEHOW THEY'VE BEEN REMOVED IN THIS TRAILER BILL- FROM BEING ABLE TO BE QUALIFIED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT SAVINGS PROGRAM. I DON'T THINK WE CAN HELP PROGRAM THAT THAT I WAS PROPOSED- INCLUDES TWO COMPONENTS THERE. SHOULD COME. A THAT IS FUNDED IT BURKE AND AVAILABLE. INS AND THEN THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTAL DEPOSITS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS ARE ALL STREET YOUTH ARE HOMELESS STUDENTS- THAT WOULD BE MADE- YOU KNOW WHEN A STUDENT ENTERS FIRST GRADE AND IN THE FIRST YEAR IT WOULD BE FOR ALL STUDENTS IN GRADES ONE THROUGH TWELVE AFTER THAT SUPPLEMENTAL DEPOSIT AND HE'S HAD WHICH MEANT OF THE CALKINS ACCOUNT FOR THOSE ST. YEAH MY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY REMOVE LIKE STUDENTS WHO ARE AT THE STATE SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF AND THE BLIND. THOSE STUDENTS DON'T QUALIFY. I KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AND IT IF THAT IS THE CASE YOU KNOW WILL CERTAINLY WORK WITH STAFF TO LOOK INTO THAT IT. OKAY SO MOVING I RESPOND BACK TO ME I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE CASE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. MR GALLAGHER BURKE MAYBE I COULD RECOMMEND TOP PERHAPS OR STAFF COULD. EMAIL FINANCE WITH THE IT BUT THE AREA. THAT THEY FOUND IN THE PREVIOUS BILL THAT. FOR SOME REASON THEY CAN FIND IN THIS NEW. THE NET AND HOPEFULLY ON THE SAME PAGE OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. SURE. I'M GOING TO BE VERY NEARLY FOCUS MY COMMENTS ARE JUST ONE PART OF THE BUDGET- DIRECTLY RELATE. TO AND MY ANA. OKAY I'M A VERY NEARLY DIRECTOR OF MY COMMENTS OF ONE PART OF THE BUDGET- ONE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY ALL OF US ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ALL OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE TRY TO CREATE AS MUCH ACCOUNTABILITY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN EACH YEAR WHEN WE ADOPTED BUDGET AND THAT MEANS REVIEWING HOW THE MONEY WAS SPENT LAST YEAR. HOW EFFECTIVELY WAS THAT MONEY SPENT AND WHAT SHOULD WE DO DIFFERENTLY A WITH ALLOCATIONS IN TERMS OF GOING FORWARD AND WHEN YOU HAVE ONGOING COMMITMENT TO FUNDING IT JUST MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE CHALLENGING- TO DO THAT KIND OF OVERSIGHT I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SOME ONGOING COMMITMENT. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE IT I THINK HE RECOGNIZES STAKEHOLDERS EXCITER HAVE EXPECTATIONS AND THEY HAVE FEWER EXPECTATIONS IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. UP IN TERMS OF FIRE PREVENTION SPENDING- I CERTAINLY COME FROM AS MANY OF US TO VERY HIGH FIRE. RISK AREA- WE'VE HAD SOME TREMENDOUS- FIRES IN IN THE AREA- AND I AM VERY INTERESTED IN FIRE PREVENTION- SPENDING IT IN IN THE BUDGET- BUT I WOULD OFFER I RAISE THIS ISSUE OF MY VERY FIRST BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE HEARING AND THAT IS THAT. THE SCIENCE OF THE POLICY ON FIRE PREVENTION IS CERTAINLY TO ME PRETTY SQUISHY. IT'S PRETTY HARD TO SAY WHAT IS THE BEST EXPENDITURE OF FIRE PREVENTION MONEY. AND I THINK IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A MAJOR FOCUS- IN THE PAST AND SO I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE FOR US TO MOVE CAUTIOUSLY. IT'S OUR BIGGER RISK BUT WE HAVE THIS MUCH MONEY TO SPEND IS THAT A YEAR FROM NOW WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF STORIES ABOUT HOW MONEY WAS WASTED NOT SPENT WELL LOOK CENTER AND SO THE IDEA THAT THIS IN OUR CURRENT BUDGET WHICH IS TO TRY TO. MOVE METHODICALLY AND MAKE SURE WE GET MAXIMUM BANG FOR THE BUCK IS ONE THAT I THINK MAKES SENSE EVEN THOUGH I AM FROM AN AREA THAT DEBT WOULD BE EASY TO SAY YOU KNOW THE MORE MONEY FOR FIRE PREVENTION TO SORT OF BETTER IT IS POLITICALLY- BUT I THINK WE HAVE A LONGER RANGE RESPONSIBILITY. AND THAT IS TO MAKE SURE WE DO IT RESPONSIBLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU APPROVED YOUR COMMENTS MISTER BENNETT I KNOW THE MISTER BLOOM AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IS GOING TO BE. DOING A SEPARATE HEARING TO. TO DELVE INTO THAT EXACT ISSUE AND ARE YOU ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE SO. APPRECIATE YOUR WORK THERE. OTHER OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. BECAUSE I'M NOT SEEING ANY WE'RE GOING TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT- ANY PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE ROOM TO COME UP TO THE MIKE. YOU'RE FREE TO COME FOR GONNA GIVE EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM A MINUTE AND THEN WE'LL GO TO THE PHONE LINE. FIGURE SKATING THE OTHER HALF OF THE BUILDING FOR EXAMPLE HERE THE LATEST ON OPPOSITION. THAT THAT IT'S ALL GOOD YEAH. THERE WE GO. IS THAT BETTER OKAY THANK YOU AGAIN JEREMY SMITH HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL- HERE AND- TODAY IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO SECTION SIXTY SEVEN OF SB ONE THIRTY TO THE HIGHER EDUCATION TRAILER BILL THAT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY. SUCH AS IF YOU SEVEN OF THIS BILL WOULD LEVERAGE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION BUDGET. TO ADVANCE THE PRIORITIES OF ASK ME LOCAL THIRTY TWO NINETY NINE BY PLACING ALL THE CONSTRUCTION CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDS FOR THE UC. INTO AN ESCROW ACCOUNT WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER. AND TELL YOU SEE IN A THIRD PARTY CAN CERTIFY- THE INFORMATION THEY NEED FROM THE UC. THE TERM PUBLIC FUNDS. IS SO BROADLY DEFINED THAT MEANS ANY KIND OF STATE FUNDS ANY DEBT FINANCING AND GRANTS PROVIDED THE UNIVERSITY THIS SCHEME WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL UC'S ABILITY TO FINANCE EVERY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT INCLUDING THOSE THAT WOULD ADDRESS LIFE SAFETY NEEDS. MEDICAL HOSPITAL FACILITIES AND STUDENT HOUSING IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS FREEZE ON CONSTRUCTION WOULD PROHIBIT EVEN CRITICALLY NEEDED SEISMIC UPGRADES ARE YOU SEE HOSPITALS. UNIVERSITY APPEARS TO BE PROHIBITED FROM SPENDING ARE YOU IN PLEDGING CONSTRUCTION FUNDS UNTIL THREE SEPARATE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES THE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THE STATE COMPTROLLER PROVIDE PRIOR APPROVAL WHICH IS NOT DEFINED. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO PUT IN LIMBO ONE GROUP OF WORKERS LIVELIHOODS EARNING POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND THE PUBLIC'S SAFETY IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF ANOTHER SET OF WORKERS. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE OPPOSE SPECIFICALLY SECTION SIXTY SEVEN OF SB ONE THREE TWO AND URGE YOU TO REMOVE IT BEFORE FINAL PASSAGE THANK YOU.

AND IT'S NOT BEING FOLLOWED BY THE UNIVERSITY THE ANSWER IS NOT TO MAKE THE OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT MORE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT CAN ACTUALLY THREATEN BUILDING. IS TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THE UNIVERSITY MEETS THE ALREADY STATUTORY REQUIREMENT NOT MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT MEETING IT WHY WOULD THEY MEET THE MORE COMPLICATED ONE.

LOCKLEY MEMBERS SHOULD NOT ASSUME ALL CHILD CARE FOR. CAN ON ZERO TO THREE OLDS. TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS EMPLOYER OLD. THIS IS. BECAUSE MANY PROGRAMS WOULD NEED TO GET RELICENSED AND RECEIVE SPECIFIC TRAINING TO ACCEPT YOUNGER CHILDREN.
