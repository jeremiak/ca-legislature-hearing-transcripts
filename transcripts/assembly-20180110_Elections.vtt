00:33:04.249 --> 00:33:07.719 region:rollup2
TRANSACTIONAL DYNAMIC WHICH SAYS

00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:08.320 region:rollup2

OF COURSE FOR THAT REASON

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:09.741 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS CAN IT'S

00:40:08.373 --> 00:40:10.541 region:rollup2

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:08.232 region:rollup2
WHERE HEAVY TO DEBATES WHETHER

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:11.202 region:rollup2
WE MODELED AFTER IOWA WE MIGHT

00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:12.370 region:rollup2
NOT A TIME PERIOD OUT OF IOWA

00:46:11.202 --> 00:46:13.804 region:rollup2
I'M WE MODEL THIS BILL AFTER.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:15.506 region:rollup2
COLORADO AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:16.274 region:rollup2
REASONS WE THEY'D ACTUALLY DON'T

00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:18.376 region:rollup2
HOW THE TIME PERIOD WE WENT

00:46:16.274 --> 00:46:23.047 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR. A FIX TO THAT.

00:46:18.376 --> 00:46:25.316 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:46:23.047 --> 00:46:26.550 region:rollup2
DO IT IS BALANCE OUT THAT NEEDS

00:46:25.316 --> 00:46:27.451 region:rollup2
TO MAKE VOTING AS EASY AS

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:32.023 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE TO REMOVE BARRIERS FOR

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:42.500 region:rollup2
THE VOTER TO MAKE IT CONVENIENT.

00:46:32.023 --> 00:46:44.035 region:rollup2
TO NOT REQUIRE A STAMP TO TO

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.202 region:rollup2
ALLOW FOLKS TO VOTE ON SAME TIME

00:46:44.035 --> 00:46:46.704 region:rollup2
SOME CERTAINTY FOR THE VOTER AND

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:48.305 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE THE FACT THAT IF

00:46:46.704 --> 00:46:49.974 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO GO CHECK UM.

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:51.042 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEY THEY CAN SEE THAT

00:46:49.974 --> 00:46:54.145 region:rollup2
THERE BALLOT HAS BEEN RECEIVED

00:46:51.042 --> 00:46:57.281 region:rollup2
IN A TIMELY MANNER AND AND THERE

00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:58.482 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO CONFUSION OR OR THERE

00:46:57.281 --> 00:46:59.717 region:rollup2
IS CONFUSION BECAUSE THERE'S

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:01.686 region:rollup2
THEIR BALLOT WENT MISSING.

00:46:59.717 --> 00:47:02.520 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS JUST TRYING TO IT TO

00:47:01.686 --> 00:47:04.655 region:rollup2
TIGHTEN UP THAT TIME FRAME.

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:06.524 region:rollup2
AYE I THINK THAT THE FULL

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:07.692 region:rollup2
RECEIPT ISSUE WOULD CAUSE

00:47:06.524 --> 00:47:09.160 region:rollup2
ANOTHER BARRIER ONE WHICH IS

00:47:07.692 --> 00:47:10.361 region:rollup2
SOUNDS KIND OF REASONABLE AND

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.263 region:rollup2
BECOMES VERY ARTIFICIALLY.

00:47:10.361 --> 00:47:13.297 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY A VOTER IS AN ADULT

00:47:12.263 --> 00:47:14.065 region:rollup2
WHO CAN MAKE THE DECISION ON

00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:15.166 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE PERSON THEY'RE

00:47:14.065 --> 00:47:17.401 region:rollup2
ASKING THEM TO TURN IN THEIR

00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:18.035 region:rollup2
BALLOT THEY TRUST TO DO THAT.

00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:18.803 region:rollup2
THAT WE TRUST THE VOTERS I THINK

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:19.403 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THAT.

00:47:18.803 --> 00:47:20.438 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK IT'S

00:47:19.403 --> 00:47:21.338 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN

00:47:20.438 --> 00:47:22.273 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ASSEMBLY RACE HELD

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:37.254 region:rollup2
SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF THE

00:47:22.273 --> 00:47:42.026 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS BILL ALLOWING ANY

AGGRESSIVE VOTE BY MAIL

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:48.532 region:rollup2
DESIGNEES HARASSING IN COURSING

00:47:47.932 --> 00:47:49.033 region:rollup2
VOTERS INTO HANDING OVER THEIR

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:49.567 region:rollup2
BALLOTS.

00:47:49.033 --> 00:47:58.376 region:rollup2
IN RESPONSE ASSEMBLY WOMAN

00:47:49.567 --> 00:48:00.511 region:rollup2

LEGISLATION NEXT SESSION. AT THE

00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:07.551 region:rollup2
VERY LEAST SHE SHOULD CONSIDER

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:10.087 region:rollup2
LIMITING THE NUMBER OF BALLOTS

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:11.722 region:rollup2
IN A SCENE R. SINGLE PERSON MAY

AND SWIFTLY BY ELECTION DAY MORE

00:48:15.793 --> 00:48:19.363 region:rollup2
BROADLY LAWMAKERS SHOULD

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:22.333 region:rollup2
REASSESS THE WISDOM OF ALLOWING

00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:23.868 region:rollup2
UNLIMITED AN UNVERIFIED THIRD

00:48:22.333 --> 00:48:24.435 region:rollup2
PARTY COLLECTION.

00:48:23.868 --> 00:48:26.203 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:48:24.435 --> 00:48:28.939 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN BEGINS IN EARNEST AND

00:48:26.203 --> 00:48:30.508 region:rollup2
VOTER SHOULD BE ALWAYS WARY. OF

THAT I EDITORIAL WAS CALLED

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:37.281 region:rollup2
DON'T ALLOW VOTER PORTION AND

00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:38.682 region:rollup2
CORRUPTION TO TAKE HOLD IN THE

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:40.718 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA MISTER

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:42.386 region:rollup2
HARPER. IT I'M SORRY IF I'M IF I

00:48:40.718 --> 00:48:43.387 region:rollup2
MAY CLARIFY BECAUSE THE POINT

00:48:42.386 --> 00:48:44.622 region:rollup2
I'M MAKING IS THAT CRITICS A LOT

00:48:43.387 --> 00:48:46.056 region:rollup2
HAVE NOTED THAT THERE. IS NO WAY

00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:48.025 region:rollup2
FOR OFFICIALS TO KEEP TRACK OF

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:49.527 region:rollup2
WHO BROUGHT IN THE BALLOTS AND

00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:51.162 region:rollup2

INVESTIGATORS.

00:48:51.162 --> 00:48:54.598 region:rollup2
I TRACKED DOWN POSSIBLE CRIMINAL

00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:55.966 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS BY SUCH DESIGNEES AND

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:57.434 region:rollup2

00:48:59.303 --> 00:49:02.907 region:rollup2
TIMES CRITICISM.

00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:04.542 region:rollup2
TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF BALLOTS

00:49:02.907 --> 00:49:06.210 region:rollup2

THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

00:50:06.403 --> 00:50:08.606 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY DIDN'T HAVE A FIELD

00:50:07.505 --> 00:50:10.508 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WAS CONCERNED THAT

00:50:08.606 --> 00:50:12.843 region:rollup2
