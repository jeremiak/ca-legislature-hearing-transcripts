00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:06.866
COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION SYSTEM

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:07.467
THAT SERVES ALL CHILDREN AND

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.135
FAMILIES MEETING THEM IN THE

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.403
COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY LIVE IN

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.838
PREPARING THE STUDENTS. FOR

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.573
HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE TWENTY

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.842
FIRST CENTURY WORKFORCE THANK

YOU SO MUCH MA'AM --

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:18.678
I NORMALLY WOULD HOLD QUESTIONS

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:22.248
BUT IF --

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:23.916
RATHER PANELIST WOULD ALLOW ME

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:24.951
AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUST ASK A

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:27.420
COUPLE QUESTIONS OF COURSE MAYBE

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:28.054
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE WANTED TO AS

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:28.955
WELL.

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:30.590
YOU KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:31.224
THIRTEEN WE SPENT A GREAT DEAL

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.225
OF TIME.

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:33.626
WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:34.894
FORMULA.

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:36.395
AND THE LOCAL CONTROL

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:38.097
ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS AND PUTTING

00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:39.899
THAT PROCESS IN PLACE --

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:41.667
HOW HOW EFFECTIVE DO YOU THINK

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:43.236
THE REVIEW PROCESS IS FOR THE

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:44.937
LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:46.472
PLANS BECAUSE I HAVE SOME

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:47.607
CONCERNS?

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:48.708
AND I THINK THAT WITH THIS NEW

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:50.309
ADMINISTRATION IT'S AN

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:52.111
OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THAT --

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:54.013
I THINK WE'VE HEARD BOTH SORT OF

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.281
SIDES TO IT THAT YOU KNOW

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:56.783
THEY'RE THE LOCAL CONTROL

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:57.950
FUNDING FORMULA A SERVE A

00:06:58.017 --> 00:06:59.519
PURPOSE TO ALLOW FOR THE

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.220
GREATEST AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:02.855
BUT WE'VE ALSO HEARD AND SOME

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.457
CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT IT'S

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:05.324
MEASURING.

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.592
AND WHERE RESOURCES ARE GOING

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.694
AND A HOME AND SO THIS

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.530
ADMINISTRATION WITH US --

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:11.998
SUPERINTEND THURMAN WE'RE GOING

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:13.332
TO EVALUATE THAT AND REALLY

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.101
LISTEN TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:16.502
WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND IF IN

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.271
FACT THE STUDENTS --

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.773
AND TEACHERS ARE REALLY --

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.441
USING THESE ROADS RESOURCES IF

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:23.910
THEY'RE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:25.511
FOR THE NEEDY STUDENTS AND SO I

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:27.180
THINK THAT STILL SOMETHING THAT

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:28.314
WERE ASSESSING A COUPLE OF

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:29.615
MINUTES A COUPLE MONTHS INTO THE

00:07:29.682 --> 00:07:31.117
THIS ADMINISTRATION.

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:33.486
AND YOU MENTION NURSES AND

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:37.023
COUNSELORS WE HEAR CONCERNS

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:38.257
ABOUT THOSE --

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:40.193
THOSE POSITIONS AND THE ISSUE

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:41.561
FROM CONSTITUENTS WITH SOME

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:42.895
REGULARITY.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.031
HOW DO WE ENSURE HOW DO WE FORCE

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:46.132
THE CONVERSATION DURING THE

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:48.267
PREPARATION OF THE LOCAL CONTROL

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:50.336
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN? TO FORCE

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:52.205
THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:53.673
DISTRICTS AND THE STAKEHOLDERS.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.808
ABOUT THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDING

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:56.843
THROUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.712
FUNDING FORMULA WITH REGARD.

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.547
TO GETTING POSITIONS FOR SCHOOL

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:02.815
COUNSELORS OR SCHOOL

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:05.618
PSYCHOLOGISTS WE HAD A PRIORITY

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.553
TO THE TO THE EIGHT THAT ALREADY

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.089
EXIST IN THE EL CAP PROCESS OR

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:13.059
DO WE ED LANGUAGE UNDER SCHOOL

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:14.327
CLIMATE TO FORCE THE

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:15.494
CONVERSATION.

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:16.696
SO THOSE ARE REALLY GREAT

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:18.698
QUESTIONS AND I THINK THAT IT'S

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:21.634
IT'S LIKE BEING KIND OF A FORCED.

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:22.902
TO MAKE UP A REALLY HARD

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.003
DECISION RIGHT.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.272
WHAT WHAT DO YOU USE THE FUNDING

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.440
FOR YOU KNOW ARE YOU TO TAKE IT

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:29.342
AWAY FROM THE INSTRUCTIONAL

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:30.376
MATERIALS IN THE PROFESSIONAL

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:31.444
DON'T THAT DAHLE IF IT'S GOING

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.678
CURRENTLY GOING ON?

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:33.512
OR DO WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:34.780
DISCUSSION ABOUT INCREASE

00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:36.883
FUNDING RESOURCES FOR SCHOOLS

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:39.418
THE WORD JUST AT THE MINIMUM

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:40.753
PROP NINETY EIGHT ADMINISTERS

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.488
THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND I

00:08:42.555 --> 00:08:43.756
THINK ONE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:45.191
PRIORITIES REALLY IS.

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:47.093
LOOKING AT OF DIFFERENT

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.361
RESOURCES ARE ADDITIONAL

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:49.795
RESOURCES --

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.430
WHETHER IT'S READING A REAL

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:52.932
LOOKING UP THE PROP THIRTEEN THE

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:55.167
SPLIT ROLE LOOKING AT TO SEE A

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:59.305
SOME OF THE TAX CREDITS THAT'S

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:02.909
BEEN THAT SPENT THAT --

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:03.709
NINETY EIGHT ALSO LOOKING AT

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:04.577
OTHER --

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:06.345
BUDGET RESOURCES AND FISCAL

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:07.780
RESOURCES --

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:09.415
AND LEVERAGING SOME HEALTH

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:11.651
RESOURCES AS WELL TO HELP WITH

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.252
THE NURSES AND SOME OF THE

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:16.122
COUNSELOR NEEDS THAT ARE HAVING --

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:17.223
A GREAT IMPACT ON THE STUDENTS

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.491
SO I I THINK WHAT YOU'RE ASKING

00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:19.992
IS WE CAN'T DO MORE WITH LESS OR

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:21.861
WITH THE SAME AMOUNT IF WE WANT

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:22.561
TO DO MORE THAN WE HAVE TO

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:23.629
INVEST.

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:26.365
IN THESE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SO --

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:28.734
THE RESTOCKING THE SAME THAT IS

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:29.302
NOT GOING TO GET YOU LESS OF

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:30.303
SOMETHING.

00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:31.671
WE'LL IN TYING INTO THAT ON A

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:33.139
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN A SLIGHTLY

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:34.173
DIFFERENT DIRECTION AN ISSUE

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.242
THAT IS DIRECTLY.

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.177
BUDGET RELATED IS THE IS A

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:39.478
SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:41.881
GRANT PIECE OF LOCAL THE LOCAL

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:43.549
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:45.151
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:46.719
TODAY YOU CAN HAVE DISTRICT ONE

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.621
THAT HAS --

00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:50.523
MORE THAN 55% ENGLISH LANGUAGE

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:54.794
AND DISTRICT.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.362
TWO CONTINUOUS NEXT TO IT THAT

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.931
HAS LESS THAN 55% THE LINE GOES

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.533
DOWN THE MIDDLE YOU CAN HAVE A

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:03.569
SCHOOL ON ONE SIDE THAT HAS 90%.

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:05.204
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS CENTER

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.273
AND THE SCHOOL ON THE OTHER SIDE

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.808
OF THE LINE THAT HAS 90%.

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:10.476
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS BUT IN

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:12.578
DIFFERENT DISTRICTS AND ONE GETS

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:14.213
50% MORE.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.581
OF THE BASS GRANT ABOVE THAT

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.249
PERCENTAGE.

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:18.317
AND THE OTHER DOES NOT.

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:22.555
AND IT COST ASSEMBLY TO EDUCATE.

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:24.390
THAT BODY OF STUDENTS INFO

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.826
SCHOOLS IS IT TIME TO EXPLORE

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:28.327
THE CONCENTRATION GRANT AND

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:29.729
PERHAPS DEAL WITH THAT IN A

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:30.596
DIFFERENT WAY.

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:31.731
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY TIME TO

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:32.999

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:34.567

PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND THE EXPAND.

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:21.080
CONSIDERING THE PRESCHOOL SLOTS

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:22.648

WILL NON ELLIE GAYS BE ABLE TO

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:28.687
FILL THE TEN THOUSAND SLOT.

00:11:28.754 --> 00:11:29.789

THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I WOULD BE

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.096
REMISS IF I DID NOT ASK THESE

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:40.666

FOR SUPPORT.

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:49.341
I THINK AS WE INVEST EXPANSION

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:50.476
OF THE SYSTEM WE ALSO HAVE TO

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.411
SUPPORT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:53.979

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:55.047
LOT OF SMART.

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:57.016

ENSURES THAT WORKING FAMILIES

BUT HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO IT

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:09.528
BECAUSE THEY OFTEN PROVIDE MORE

00:12:09.595 --> 00:12:10.963
OF THE FULL DAY FULL YEAR.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.697
FOUGHT.

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:13.499
OKAY VERY GOOD I HAVE ANOTHER

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.133
QUESTION MIGHT BE RIGHT UP YOUR

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.768
ALEY --

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:17.970
WOULD WE WANT TO GIVE PRIORITY

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:19.038
TO KIDS THAT HAVE BOTH PARENTS

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:21.440
WORKING BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NEED

00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:23.476
MORE THAN A CHILD WITH ONLY ONE

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:25.010
PARENT WORKING SO WHAT WE WORRY

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:25.878
ABOUT IS.

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:26.979
YOU KNOW IF IF YOU'RE FORTUNATE

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:29.181
ENOUGH TO BE IN A FAMILY WHERE

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:30.649
ONE PARENT STAYS HOME.

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:33.052
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN BOTH

00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:37.389
PARENTS HAVE TO WORK COOL.

00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:38.858
AND THAT'S WHEN AT THAT TIME FOR

00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:40.559
QUESTIONS SO WE ALWAYS LOOK AT

00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:41.894
SINCE WE HAVE THAT'S THE CITY OF

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:42.928
THE CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:44.697

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:47.299
RIGHT NOW.

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:48.934
AS WE LOOK TOWARDS FULL DAY FULL

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:51.070
YEAR IT TYPICALLY MAKES SENSE TO

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:53.439
SUPPORT THOSE WORKING FAMILIES --

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:54.440
BUT THERE ARE UNIQUE FAMILY

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:56.108
CIRCUMSTANCES SO IT'S REALLY

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:57.810
HARD TO SAY THAT THE TWO PARENT

00:12:57.877 --> 00:12:58.978
WITH ONE PARENT WORKING.

00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:00.012
AND THERE MIGHT BE OTHER

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.480
CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND THAT.

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:02.848
THAT'S FAIR I WOULD JUST LIKE TO

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:06.252
MAKE SURE WE THINK ABOUT THT.

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:06.852

TRANSPORTATION 40% OF COMMITTEE

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:46.571

00:24:49.487 --> 00:24:50.956

00:24:51.022 --> 00:24:52.891
I AM A BIG FAN OF COMMUNITY

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.459
COLLEGE THAT'S WHERE I STARTED

00:24:54.526 --> 00:24:55.994
AT MOUNT SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE

00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:57.529
MOUNT SAC BACK IN THE DAY WILL

00:24:57.596 --> 00:24:59.331
TAKE HOW LONG AGO SOME YOU MIGHT

00:24:59.397 --> 00:25:00.599
THINK I'M YOUNGER THAN I AM --

00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:02.734

YEAH YEAH COULDN'T LOVE IT.

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:05.203
A BIT I HAD THE BEST ENGLISH

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.305
CLASS OF MY WHOLE COLLEGE CAREER

00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:08.607
AT MOUNT SAC.

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:12.711
AND WHEN I HEARD THAT PAYING

00:25:12.777 --> 00:25:14.446
MORE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE THEN

00:25:14.512 --> 00:25:15.914
THEY WERE TO ATTEND THE UC OR

00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:17.782
SEE ISSUE JUST STRICTLY BECAUSE

00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:18.917
OF FINANCIAL AID WASN'T

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:20.752
AVAILABLE TO THEM I JUST THOUGHT

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:22.821
THEY WERE SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO --

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:23.922
SO WHATEVER --

00:25:23.989 --> 00:25:25.557
I CAN CONTINUE TO DO TO BE

00:25:25.624 --> 00:25:27.859
SUPPORTIVE I WILL I HOPE THAT WE

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:30.195

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:37.202
PRIORITIES.

ARE SO WE SAY THESE ARE OUR

00:25:39.437 --> 00:25:41.840
CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE AND NOT

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:43.108
ALWAYS CHILDREN A COMMUNICABLE

00:25:43.174 --> 00:25:44.276
JUST BUT IF WE REALLY DO WANT

00:25:44.342 --> 00:25:46.011
THEM TO SUCCEED THEN WE NEED TO

00:25:46.077 --> 00:25:47.345
PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS.

00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:48.580
IN THE MEANTIME --

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:50.615
BEFORE WE HOPEFULLY GET THAT

00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:51.249
BILL TO THE GOVERNOR AND GET IT

00:25:51.316 --> 00:25:52.183
SIGNED.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.952
HOW DO YOU SEE HOW DO YOU THINK

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:55.453
YOU'RE USING THE DOLLARS MOST

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.955
EFFICIENTLY ARE YOU TALKED A

00:25:57.022 --> 00:25:59.257
LITTLE BIT ABOUT EVIDENCE BASED

00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:00.492
STUDENT SUCCESS?

00:26:00.558 --> 00:26:02.060
SO CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:03.662
MORE ABOUT THAT HOW YOU'RE USING

00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:05.230
THE MONEY IN THAT AND AND THE

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:06.965
EVIDENCE BASED STUDENT SUCCESS

00:26:07.032 --> 00:26:09.301
YES.

00:26:09.367 --> 00:26:11.036
SO -- YOU

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:12.537
KNOW WITH HIGHER EDUCATION --

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:13.805
AND WITH THE COMMUNICATIVE

00:26:13.872 --> 00:26:15.941
SPECIFICALLY ME WE HAVE THE

00:26:16.007 --> 00:26:17.475
GREAT PRIVILEGE IN THE

00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:18.944
CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES OF

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.945
ACCEPTING THE TOP 1100% OF

00:26:20.011 --> 00:26:22.080
STUDENTS.

00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:25.016
EVERY STUDENT WHO HAS A DESIRE

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:26.818
TO ACCESS CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:28.153
EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS THE

00:26:28.219 --> 00:26:29.321
OPPORTUNITY IN THE CALIFORNIA

00:26:29.387 --> 00:26:31.089
COMMITTEE COLLEGES.

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:32.424
WITH THAT SAID THAT MEANS THAT

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.092
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:36.227
NEEDS THAT APPROACH --

00:26:36.294 --> 00:26:37.896
COLLEGES ON ANY GIVEN DAY.

00:26:37.963 --> 00:26:39.397
AND SO --

00:26:39.464 --> 00:26:41.800
FIRST WE WANT TO TRY TO DIRECT

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:43.601
THE PRECIOUS RESOURCES THAT THE

00:26:43.668 --> 00:26:46.271
LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATED. TO

00:26:46.338 --> 00:26:48.073
AREAS THAT HAVE THE GREATEST

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:49.441
IMPACT ON OUR STUDENTS IN

00:26:49.507 --> 00:26:50.976
BECAUSE OUR STUDENTS OR THE

00:26:51.042 --> 00:26:53.712
GATEWAY TO HIGHER EDUCATION.

00:26:53.778 --> 00:26:55.246
TO STUDENTS OF COLOR IN LOW

00:26:55.313 --> 00:26:56.948
INCOME COMMUNITIES.

00:26:57.015 --> 00:26:59.351
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT --

00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:03.054
THAT WE ARE HALF WAY FOR THEM.

00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:05.423
US SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.392
TIME TO COMPLETION FOR THEM --

00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:08.960
OUR STUDENTS COME BECAUSE THEY

00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:11.296
WANT TO IMPROVE THEIR ECONOMIC

00:27:11.363 --> 00:27:13.465
AND SOCIAL MOBILITY --

00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:15.567
AND WHILE OUR COLLEGES DO

00:27:15.633 --> 00:27:16.735
EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER EVERY

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:19.137
DAY TO DO THAT IN MANY CASES THE

00:27:19.204 --> 00:27:20.205
WAY THAT WE STRUCTURE

00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:21.539
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:27:21.606 --> 00:27:22.941
A KEEPS OUR STUDENTS IN OUR

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:25.010
CLASSROOMS IN OUR CAMPUSES FAR

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:27.812
LONGER THAN THAN THEY NEED TO BE.

00:27:27.879 --> 00:27:29.447
AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO REDUCE

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:31.216
THE AMOUNT OFCREDITS THAT OUR

00:27:31.282 --> 00:27:32.517
STUDENTS ACCUMULATE THAT DON'T

00:27:32.584 --> 00:27:34.753
LEAD TO THEIR EAT EDUCATIONAL

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:35.353
GOAL.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.890
OF WE HAVE ENACTED REFORMS THAT

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:41.092
TO ALLOW OUR STUDENTS THE

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:42.627
ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN

00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:43.962
TRANSFER LEVEL COURSES AS SOON

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:45.530
AS THEY GET OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

00:27:45.597 --> 00:27:46.831
USING THE MULTIPLE MEASURES

00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:48.099
PLATFORM TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:49.701
LOOKING AT HIGH SCHOOL GPA HIGH

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:50.902
SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS IS A BETTER

00:27:50.969 --> 00:27:54.072
PREDICTOR OF SUCCESS THAN

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:56.174
STANDARDIZED PLACEMENT EXAMS --

00:27:56.241 --> 00:27:57.142
WE'RE ALSO --

00:27:57.208 --> 00:27:59.444
WORKING WITH OUR COLLEGES --

00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:00.178
IMPLEMENTING THE CALIFORNIA

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:02.614
COLLEGE PROMISE IN ENSURING THAT

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.482
NOT ONLY ARE WE WAIVING FEES AND

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:05.283
I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.785
POINT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HEARING

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:08.953
COLLEGES HAVE THE LOWEST FEES IN

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.321
THE COUNTRY --

00:28:10.388 --> 00:28:12.190
THE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE IN

00:28:12.257 --> 00:28:13.224
THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:15.093
COLLEGES NOT TO WISH WHICH IS A

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.795
LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN OUR SISTER

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:18.063
INSTITUTIONS.

00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:19.397
ON THE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE

00:28:19.464 --> 00:28:20.765
IN CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE CAUSES

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:22.500
ACOSTA TRANSPORTATION BOOKS

00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:23.334
SUPPLIES.

00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:27.505
THE COST OF NOT HAVING TO WILL --

00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:29.107
AND BEING ABLE TO TAKE A FULL

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:30.308
LOAD AND GET TO THEIR

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.443
EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES GROWTH IS

00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:33.011
POSSIBLE SO WE'RE WORKING WITH

00:28:33.078 --> 00:28:34.813
OUR COLLEGES TO ENSURE THAT.

00:28:34.879 --> 00:28:36.815
THE FUNDS UNDER A. B. NINETEEN

00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:39.050
THAT WERE APPROPRIATED GO TO

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:40.952
SUPPORT A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:42.420
NOT ONLY GAIN ACCESS TO OUR

00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:44.022
COLLEGES.

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:45.757
WITHOUT PAYING A FEE BUT TO GET

00:28:45.824 --> 00:28:47.092
THROUGH OUR COLLEGES AS QUICKLY

00:28:47.158 --> 00:28:49.427
AS POSSIBLE SO THAT'S A UP A

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:50.895
SMALL SLICE OF SOME OF THE

00:28:50.962 --> 00:28:51.930
THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING SO TO

00:28:51.996 --> 00:28:53.898
REDUCE COMPLETION TIME.

00:28:53.965 --> 00:28:56.134
IS THAT OFFERING MORE SECTIONS

00:28:56.201 --> 00:28:59.337
OF A PARTICULAR SUBJECT --

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:00.905
IN AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:29:00.972 --> 00:29:03.007
REDUCING CREDITS THAT --

00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:04.542
STUDENTS TAKE BEGIN HAVE BEEN OF

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:05.743
CLASSES THEY DON'T REALLY NEED

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:06.744
DO THEY END UP TAKING THOSE

00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:08.580
CLASSES BECAUSE WHAT THEY REALLY

00:29:08.646 --> 00:29:09.881
NEED ISN'T AVAILABLE AND IT JUST

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:11.149
TRYING TO STAY.

00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:12.951
IN THE RHYTHM SO TO SPEAK BUT

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:14.619
HOW HOW DO WE REDUCE THAT TIME

00:29:14.686 --> 00:29:16.254
SPECIFICALLY SAID OPENING MORE

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:17.355
SECTIONS.

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:19.457
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION --

00:29:19.524 --> 00:29:20.792
SO STUDENTS COME TO COMMITTEE

00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:22.627
COLLEGE AND THEY HAVE A VARIETY

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.329
OF DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL GOALS

00:29:24.395 --> 00:29:26.331
BUT LET'S JUST SAY STUDENT COMES

00:29:26.397 --> 00:29:27.232
THE OMMUNICANTS.

00:29:27.298 --> 00:29:30.034
WANTING --

00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:31.936
TO TRANSFERRED TO THEIR CSU

00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:33.371
CAMPUS AS AN ENGLISH MAJOR.

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:34.839
OUR GOAL IN THE GUIDED PATHWAYS

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:36.574
FRAMEWORK IS TO ENSURE THAT FROM

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:38.610
DAY ONE THE DAY THEY HAD THE

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:43.014
CAMPUS THEY HAVE A CLEAR ROADMAP.

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:43.581
TO HOW TO MAKE THAT TRANSFER

00:29:43.648 --> 00:29:46.351
HAVE -- SO

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:48.019
FROM DAY ONE WE ARE HELPING

00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:49.587
GUIDE THEM WITH THE ROADMAP I

00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:52.290
GUIDED PATHWAYS TO ENSURE.

00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:53.057
THAT THEY'RE NOT STRAY FROM IT

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:53.591
NOW.

00:29:53.658 --> 00:29:54.759
THAT DOESN'T PREVENT A STUDENT

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:55.627
FROM WANTING TO TAKE AN

00:29:55.693 --> 00:29:57.262
ADDITIONAL COURSE BECAUSE THEY

00:29:57.328 --> 00:29:58.163
FEEL LIKE TAKING AN ADDITIONAL

00:29:58.229 --> 00:29:59.497
COURSE BUT IF THEY'RE RECEIVING

00:29:59.564 --> 00:30:01.032
FINANCIAL AID AND THEY HAVE TO

00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:02.901
HAVE AT LEAST TWELVE UNITS TO

00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:04.169
RECEIVE FULL AID.

00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:05.470
THEN THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO FIND

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:06.971
COURSES THAT DON'T TRANSFERRED

00:30:07.038 --> 00:30:09.707
TO THEIR TO HELP THEM TRANSFER

00:30:09.774 --> 00:30:11.609
IS AN ENGLISH MAJOR. TO OUR

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:13.978
COLLEGES REALLY HAVE --

00:30:14.045 --> 00:30:15.780
TO RESTRUCTURE THE CLASS

00:30:15.847 --> 00:30:17.982
SCHEDULE REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW

00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.650
TO MAKE THE STUDENT WHERE

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:21.052
THEY'RE AT AND ALSO --

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:23.888
BECAUSE OF AB SEVEN OH FIVE MOVE

00:30:23.955 --> 00:30:25.290
THE STUDENT TO A TRANSFER LEVEL

00:30:25.356 --> 00:30:26.558
CORES -- IN

00:30:26.624 --> 00:30:28.193
ENGLISH AND MATH WITHIN THEIR

00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:31.262
FIRST YEAR --

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:31.930
SO THAT IS --

00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:33.131
MAY BE A DIFFICULT TASK FOR SOME

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:34.999
OF OUR COLLEGES --

00:30:35.066 --> 00:30:37.268
BUT IS A NECESSARY TASK AND IT

00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:38.770
DOVETAILS VERY WELL WITH THE

00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:40.705
WORDS HAPPY IN THE CSU AROUND

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:42.774
THEIR OWN REMEDIATION REFORM SO

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.375
WE HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT

00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:46.477
REMEDIAL EDUCATION THE WAY THAT

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:47.111
WE'VE BEEN APPROACH AND IT DOES

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:48.613
NOT WORK HAS A DETRIMENTAL

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.014
IMPACT ON STUDENTS OF COLOR AND

00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:50.215
LOW.

INCOME STUDENTS SO WE'RE WORKING

00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:54.485

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:40.498
PROGRAM.

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:42.500
THIS IS DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:44.435
THE ENROLLMENT FEES FOR THOSE

00:31:44.502 --> 00:31:46.404

FOR STUDENTS.

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:56.180
SO -- ALL OF

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:57.515
THE FEE WAIVERS ARE CAPTURE IN

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:58.916
THE UMBRELLA OF WHAT WE CALL THE

CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE NO

THE BOARD OF GOVERNOR FEE

00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:13.097
WAIVERS SO WE WAIVE FEES FOR ALL

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:14.966
LOW INCOME STUDENTS OF STUDENTS

00:32:15.033 --> 00:32:16.167
SHOW THAT THERE'S A FINANCIAL

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:18.536
NEED THEY QUALIFY FOR THE FEE

00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:21.139
WAIVER THAT WAS IN EFFECT BEFORE.

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:24.242
AB NINETEEN WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGE

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:25.610
OF STUDENTS IN THE SYSTEM.

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:29.147
NEARLY 50% PARTICIPATE IN THAT

00:32:29.213 --> 00:32:30.148
FREEWAY FROM THE WAY HOME THEN

00:32:30.214 --> 00:32:31.582
THERE'S THE OTHER 50% AND THEN

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:33.851
THERE'S THE OTHER 50% WHICH A.

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:35.153
B..

00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:36.821
NINETEEN AUTHORIZED THE USE OF

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:38.556
STATE FUNDS TO WAIVE FEES FOR

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:40.525
ALL FIRST TIME FULL TIME

00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:42.093
STUDENTS AND THIS IS WITHOUT

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.294
REGARD TO NEED.

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:45.463
THIS IS WITHOUT REGARD TO NEED

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.333
HOWEVER TO HAVE NEED WILL

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:49.967
AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THEIR FEES

00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:52.170
WAVE SO IN ADDITION TO THOSE LOW

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:54.572
INCOME STUDENTS AB NINETEEN

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:56.107
ALLOWS THE COLLEGES. TO DIRECT

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:57.508
THOSE FUNDS TO WAIVE FEES FOR

00:32:57.575 --> 00:32:58.876
STUDENTS WHO DID NOT MEET THAT

00:32:58.943 --> 00:32:59.944
THRESHOLD.

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:01.212
THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:03.281
WHICH IS IMPORTANT IS THAT IF A

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:05.016
COLLEGE FEELS THAT THERE IS AN

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:07.018
ADDITIONAL TYPES OF NEED AT

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.486
THEIR COLLEGE THEY CAN USE THOSE

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:10.521
SAME FUNDS AND NOT WAIVE FEES

00:33:10.588 --> 00:33:12.056
BUT YOU SOME FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:13.291
THAT THEY FEEL.

00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:15.126
WOULD BENEFIT THEIR STUDENTS --

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:16.694
EVEN MORE ALTHOUGH NOT SO THAT

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:18.262
THE MONEY IS NOT RESTRICTED TO A

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:19.764
WAIVER OF ENROLLMENT FEES IT IS

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:22.734
ONLY RESTRICTED TO EITHER A A

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.936
FEE WAIVER OR SHOWING EVIDENCE

00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:27.472
THAT THAT MONEY IS BEING USED --

00:33:27.538 --> 00:33:30.341
TO IMPROVE A STUDENT'S ABILITY

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:32.176
TO SUCCEED SO PRESENTATION

00:33:32.243 --> 00:33:34.946
VOUCHERS FOR YES SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:36.414
IF A COLLEGE --

00:33:36.481 --> 00:33:40.051
HAS A VERY HIGH A LOW INCOME

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:40.918
COMMUNITY --

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:42.353
WHICH ALREADY QUALIFIES FOR THE

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.454
FEE WAIVER.

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:45.690
THEY CAN USE THOSE AB NINETEEN

00:33:45.757 --> 00:33:47.458
FUNDS -- FOR

00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:48.693
SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT IKE

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.094
TRANSPORTATION VOUCHERS LIKE

00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:52.130
BOOK VOUCHERS --

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:53.664
PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL

00:33:53.731 --> 00:33:55.400
FINANCIAL LITERACY SUPPORT SO

00:33:55.466 --> 00:33:56.634
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:58.169
IT CAN BE USED BUT ITS PRIMARY

00:33:58.236 --> 00:33:59.103
FUNCTION.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.806
IS TO REDUCE THE BARRIER OF FOR

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:02.974
STUDENTS GETTING INTO COMMUNITY

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.609
COLLEGE --

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:05.943
REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BARRIER.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.311
SO IT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEN THE

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:09.614
PURPOSE.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.782
IN THE IMPLEMENTATION YOU'RE

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:11.749
GONNA BE DIRECTING THIS MONEY

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:13.418
TOWARD.

00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:15.253
THOSE STUDENTS.

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:17.555
WHO HAVE NEED?

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:18.890
THOSE STUDENTS WHO HAVE NEED AND

00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:20.324
THE BECAUSE THAT WOULD WHEN YOU

00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:22.160
READ IT ON ITS FACE RIGHT IT

00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:23.227
SOUNDS LIKE.

00:34:23.294 --> 00:34:24.729
THE NEEDY STUDENTS GET WHAT USED

00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:26.364
TO BE CALLED THE BOARD OF

00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:27.865
GOVERNORS WAIVER RIGHT.

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:28.933
AND THEN THOSE WHO DON'T NEED

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.569
ANY ASSISTANCE QUALIFY FOR THE

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:34.405
COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM MONEY IS

00:34:34.472 --> 00:34:36.307

TIME STUDENT FULL TIME IN FIRST

00:34:38.176 --> 00:34:38.910
FIRST TIME.

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:40.344
BUT NOT NECESSARILY CAN YOU CAN

00:34:40.411 --> 00:34:41.612
YOU CAN DIVERT THAT MONEY FOR

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.014
TRANSPORTATION VOUCHERS AND THE

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.016
LIKE TO THE MOST NEEDY YOU COULD

00:34:45.082 --> 00:34:46.584
YOU COULD AND THE OTHER REASON

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:48.186
FOR THE FLEXIBILITY IS THAT

00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:49.854
THERE ARE COMMUNITIES --

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:51.656
FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW --

00:34:51.722 --> 00:34:53.057
LONG BEACH AND STUDENTS AND

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:54.225
BURNED A DINO --

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:55.460
HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT

00:34:55.526 --> 00:34:57.995
PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT SO WE WANT.

00:34:58.062 --> 00:34:59.931
COLLEGES TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:01.299
TO LEVERAGE THEIR PHILANTHROPIC

00:35:01.365 --> 00:35:02.300
SUPPORT SO.

00:35:02.366 --> 00:35:04.769
WHERE I CAME FROM LONG BEACH THE

00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:09.140
COMMUNITY SO AB NINETEEN ALLOWED

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:10.541
LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE TO ADD

AN ADDITIONAL YEAR?

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:13.077
OF FREE TUITION SO THERE ARE

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:14.745
NUMBER OF WE WANTED TO ENSURE

00:35:14.812 --> 00:35:16.214
THAT COMMUNITIES HAD SOME

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.015
FLEXIBILITY DEPENDING ON THE

00:35:18.082 --> 00:35:19.784
LOCAL SITUATION AND WHO MAKES

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:21.152
THE DECISION AS TO HOW THAT

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:22.620
MONEY IS USED IN THE COLLEGE

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:24.589
PROMISE PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WHO

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:25.957

00:35:26.023 --> 00:35:27.492
THAT -- ONCE

00:35:27.558 --> 00:35:28.793
THE NEEDIEST STUDENTS OR OR

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.328
TAKING CARE OF THROUGH THE WHAT

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:31.562
USED TO BE CALLED THE BOARD OF

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:32.730
GOVERNORS WAIVER.

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:34.899
THAT THE MONEY IS NOT GOING TO

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.435
GO TO THE THE THE TOP 25% IN

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:39.504
TERMS OF ASSETS BUT INSTEAD IS

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.372
GOING TO FUND TRANSPORTATION

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:43.774
VOUCHERS AND BOOK OF FEES AND

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:45.743
THE LIKE WHO MAKES THAT DECISION --

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.646
THE LOCALLY ELECTED BOARDS OF

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:50.581
TRUSTEES.

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:51.582
IN THOSE AREAS.

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:54.051
NOW WITH RESPECT TO METRICS WHAT.

00:35:54.118 --> 00:35:56.521
DOES PROGRAM'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:58.155
THE FIRST YEAR.

00:35:58.222 --> 00:36:01.425
YES SO THE THE PROGRAM WAS

00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:04.495
FUNDED IN THE LAST BUDGET SO IT

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:05.963
IS.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.465
STILL IN ITS FIRST YEAR --

00:36:07.532 --> 00:36:09.901
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE EVIDENCE FROM

00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:10.935
PROGRAMS THAT ALREADY BEEN

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:13.671
EXISTENCE OF FOR MANY YEARS THAT

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:14.872
SUGGESTS THAT.

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:15.873
IT HAS A A SIGNIFICANTLY

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.076
POSITIVE MOUNT OF HIGH SCHOOL

00:36:19.143 --> 00:36:20.111
STUDENTS --

00:36:20.177 --> 00:36:21.946
ATTENDING COLLEGE RIGHT OUT OF

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:24.048
HIGH SCHOOL DO YOU HAVE A SET OF

00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:26.417
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT WE

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:28.419
HOPE TO ACHIEVE WITH THE PROGRAM.

00:36:28.486 --> 00:36:30.488
SO THE ANSWER IS YES PRIMARILY

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:32.056
THE GOALS ARE TO SATISFY THE

00:36:32.123 --> 00:36:33.357
GOALS OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:35.226
SO WE SEE THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:37.261
PROMISES A COMPONENT --

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:40.398
AS A VERY POSITIVE --

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:42.166
A STEP IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:43.668
SO THE VISION FOR SUCCESS HAS

00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:45.336
SOME SPECIFIC GOALS FOR EXAMPLE

00:36:45.403 --> 00:36:46.470
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:48.539
CREDENTIALS EARNED.

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:50.775
A AT A COLLEGE CAMPUS BY A 20%

00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:52.243
ANNUAL ANNUALLY INCREASING

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.879
TRANSFER BY 35% ANNUALLY --

00:36:54.946 --> 00:36:59.116
AS WELL AS CLOSING THE

00:36:59.183 --> 00:37:00.251
IT WITHIN TEN YEARS SO.

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:01.719
WE SEE THAT CALIFORNIA COLLEGE

00:37:01.786 --> 00:37:03.487
PROMISES A COMPONENT OF THAT

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:05.323
STRATEGY AND WE WILL BE

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:06.991
MEASURING THE IMPACT --

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:09.193
BASED ON THOSE METRICS AND AND

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.528
IS THE DATA BEING COLLECTED

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:12.763
CENTRALLY BY YOUR OFFICE OR

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:13.264
HOUSE YES.

00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:15.399
IT IS COLLECTED CENTRALLY BY OUR

00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:16.968
OFFICE AND REPORTED TO THE BOARD

00:37:17.034 --> 00:37:19.537
OF GOVERNORS.

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:21.072
NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE CAL

00:37:21.138 --> 00:37:23.908

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:25.309
WHAT?

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:26.410
WHAT'S MAYBE WE COULD BE MORE

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:28.179
SPECIFIC AS TO THE ISSUES THAT

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:29.647
YOU SEE WITH THE CAL GRANT

00:37:29.714 --> 00:37:31.282
PROGRAM YOU'VE MENTIONED.

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:32.984
THAT OF COURSE THE COST OF

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.785
EDUCATION IS NOT JUST A FEES

00:37:34.852 --> 00:37:36.887
INVOLVED BUT THE ASSOCIATED

00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:38.656
LIVING EXPENSES AND THE LIKE.

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:39.991
I'M A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT I

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:41.659
GRADUATE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:41.993
WANT TO DO --

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:44.795
A COURSE AROUND FOR A COUPLE

00:37:44.862 --> 00:37:47.465

LIKE ME.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.201
TELL ME.

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:50.801
I FINALLY FIGURE OUT THAT I'M

00:37:50.868 --> 00:37:53.804
GONNA NEED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:54.872
TO BE ABLE TO GET A CREDENTIAL

00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:56.974
AND GUESTS AND ARE LIVING.

00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:58.943
AND I AND ROLL BUT SORT OF CAL

00:37:59.010 --> 00:37:59.977
GRANT OPPORTUNITIES DO I HAVE A

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:01.345
ZERO POINT.

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:04.281
SO IF YOU GO TO A COMMUNITY

00:38:04.348 --> 00:38:06.617
COLLEGE AFTER --

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:07.952
BEING AT A HIGH SCHOOL FOR MORE

00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:10.054
THAN ONE YEAR YOU BEGIN TO LOSE

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:11.622
ELIGIBILITY OR IF YOU GO TO

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:13.090
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AFTER.

00:38:13.157 --> 00:38:14.558
A CERTAIN AGE YOU LOSE

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.293
ELIGIBILITY --

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.097
SO THERE ARE AS WELL AS IF YOU

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:21.699
DON'T HAVE --

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:23.167
HIGH ENOUGH GPA RIGHT I AT

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:25.102
SCHOOL YOU MAY LOSE ELIGIBILITY

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:27.204
SIR AND THEIR NUMBER OF BARRIERS

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:28.572
IN THE WAY AND THAT'S WHY.

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:29.974
PARTICIPATION THE CAL GRANT

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:30.975
SYSTEM FOR COMMITTEE COLLEGE

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:33.944
STUDENTS IS LESS THAN 10% --

00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:35.713
SO IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE --

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.248
BECAUSE WE PRIMARILY SERVE

00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:39.784
ADULTS STUDENTS AVERAGE AGES

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.186
TWENTY FIVE IN OUR SYSTEM --

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:46.524
AND ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.192
ANYA WE ARE CERTAINLY AT FAULT

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:49.827
FOR CREATING THIS MYTH THAT IS

00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:51.395
INEXPENSIVE TO GO TO COMMUNITY

00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:52.096
COLLEGE.

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.231
BECAUSE OF THE LOW COST OF

00:38:54.298 --> 00:38:56.000
TUITION.

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:57.702
BUT OF THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE

00:38:57.768 --> 00:38:58.903
ACCESS AND SUCCESS IS DONE

00:38:58.969 --> 00:39:00.504
SEVERAL STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT

00:39:00.571 --> 00:39:02.406
THE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE

00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:02.907
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:04.008
PARTICIPATION.

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:06.210
IN THE CAL GRANT AND IN THE

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:07.912
FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM.

00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:10.581
IT HIS BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:11.649
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT TO

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:11.882
ATTEND.

00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:14.552
AND SO THE OTHER REASON IS YOU

00:39:14.618 --> 00:39:15.820
COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL IF YOU

00:39:15.886 --> 00:39:17.021
CAN'T GET ACCESS TO THE CAL

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:18.255
GRANT SYSTEM.

00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:21.292
YOU TEND TO HAVE TO WORK --

00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:22.860
OR IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY YOU HAVE

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:24.528
TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN GO PART

00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:26.163
TIME SO THAT EXTENDS THE TIME

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.431
THAT YOU'RE IN THE COMMUNITY

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:29.100
COLLEGES SO. FOR ALL THOSE

00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:31.001
REASONS WE FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT

00:39:31.068 --> 00:39:32.069
TO RE LOOK AT THE CAL GRANT

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:33.404
SYSTEM AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:34.739
THEY WOULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT

00:39:34.805 --> 00:39:36.006
INVESTMENT.

00:39:36.073 --> 00:39:37.775
IN THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM BECAUSE

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:39.643
WERE CERTAINLY NOT TALKING ABOUT.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.878
REDIRECTING FUNDS IN THE CAL

00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:42.780
GRANT SYSTEM WE WANT TO EXPAND

00:39:42.847 --> 00:39:43.881
ACCESS TO THE CAR BECAUSE IT'S

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:46.016
MY UNDERSTANDING IF I JUMP RIGHT

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:47.918
IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF HIGH

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:49.787
SCHOOL OR MAY BE WAS CERTAINLY

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:51.188
WITH ANY OF YOUR THAT I'M.

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:53.257
AUTOMATICALLY ENTITLED TO A CAL

00:39:53.324 --> 00:39:56.327
GRANT OF ONE FLAVOR OR ANOTHER.

00:39:56.393 --> 00:39:58.195
YOU YOU ARE CERTAINLY ENTITLED

00:39:58.262 --> 00:40:00.531
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CAN

00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:02.466
COMPETITIVE CABINET I MEAN.

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:04.401
AND IF I WAIT TWO OR THREE YEARS

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:06.604
I FALL INTO THE COMPETITIVE CAL

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.139
GRANT PROGRAM DONA.

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:10.374
IDIOM AND AGAIN THE NUMBER OF

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:14.345
THOSE IS WHAT THIRTY THOUSAND IN

00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:15.579
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OR SO --

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:16.347
I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER OF

00:40:16.413 --> 00:40:17.615
THOUGHT MY HEAD BUT IS SOMEWHERE

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:18.849
IN THAT RANGE AND SOMEONE

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:20.885
SUGGESTED TO ME THAT THE NUMBER

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:23.320
OF APPLICANTS. FOR THAT

00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:24.922
PARTICULAR CATEGORY THE

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:27.324
COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IS

00:40:27.391 --> 00:40:28.993
SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:31.262
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT'S

00:40:31.328 --> 00:40:32.797
PROBABLY AN ACCURATE NUMBER SO

00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:34.832
THE THE POPULATION THAT WE ARE

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:36.033
ATTEMPTING AND HAVE BEEN

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.935
FOCUSING ON APPEAR IN SACRAMENTO

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:39.036
FOR SOME TIME WITH.

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:41.205
CAREER TECH EDUCATION.

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:44.775
TAKING PEOPLE WHO WERE INSTALLED --

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:46.877
OCCUPATIONS AND AND ALLOWING

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:48.445
THEM TO RE TOOL SO THEY CAN

00:40:48.512 --> 00:40:50.381
PARTICIPATE IN THE IN THE MARKET

00:40:50.447 --> 00:40:52.316
PLACE IN A IN A BETTER WAY FOR

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:53.784
THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES.

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:55.886
WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY CUT THEM OUT

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:57.221
OF THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WHEN IT

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:59.423
COMES TO CAL GRANT PARTICIPATION

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.059
UNLESS THEY FALL WITHIN THE 10%

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:03.561
THAT HAPPENS TO GET.

00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:06.864
YES AN AWARD YES AND WE HAVE

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:08.666
VERY LOW PARTICIPATION IN THE

00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:09.834
CHARACTER AND SYSTEM.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.303
IN ADDITION TO YOU KNOW IT IS WE

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:13.470
HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AS

00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:16.507
WELL AS A SYSTEM WE HAVE NOT --

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:18.242
LOOK TO FINANCIAL AID IN THE

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:20.477
SAME WY THE UC AND CSU LOOKS AT

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:21.645
IT I MEAN YOUR OF YOUR STUDENT

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:23.214
GOING TO UC.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.382
YOU'RE IMMEDIATELY ASSAULTED BY

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:26.884
THE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE PACKAGE

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:28.586
FOR FINANCIAL AID AND WE HAVE TO

00:41:28.652 --> 00:41:29.987
DO SOMETHING SIMILAR --

00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:31.355
WE HAVE TO TAKE FINANCIAL AID

00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:32.823
VERY SERIOUS IN OUR IN OUR

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:34.158
SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHY.

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:35.693
WE'RE NOT ONLY ASKING FOR THE

00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:37.661
LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE ACCESS

00:41:37.728 --> 00:41:38.796
TO THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM BUT WE

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:40.197
ARE ALSO COMMITTING TO

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:41.999
INCREASING.

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:43.534
OUR CAPACITY IN OUR FINANCIAL

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:45.302
FINANCIAL AID OFFICES IN OUR

00:41:45.369 --> 00:41:46.670
EXPECTATION THAT WE PACKAGE

00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:48.472
STUDENTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:50.241
FROM DAY ONE WELL I'M NOT BEING

00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:53.177
CRITICAL OF YOU OR THE COMMUNITY

00:41:53.244 --> 00:41:54.845
COLLEGE SYSTEM BUT AS A AS A

00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:56.380
LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY AS THE

00:41:56.447 --> 00:41:58.148
ADMINISTRATION I THINK IF WE IF

00:41:58.215 --> 00:41:58.415
WE MEAN.

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:00.651
WHAT WE SAY WITH RESPECT TO

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:02.553
HEALTH EDUCATION AND CAREER TECH

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.988
EDUCATION AND?

00:42:04.054 --> 00:42:04.989
LIFTING PEOPLE OUT OF THESE

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:07.424
STALLED THE OCCUPATIONS IN

00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:08.659
CAREER FIELDS AND GIVING THEM.

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:11.028
A LEG UP TO BE SUCCESSFUL WERE

00:42:11.095 --> 00:42:12.529
GONNA HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB.

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:14.198
ON THE CAL GRANT SIDE BY

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:15.966
ALLOWING THEM TO HAVE A HAVE

00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:18.602
MORE THAN A 10% CHANCE RIGHT --

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:19.236
TO GET SOME SOME MADE OUT OF THE

00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:22.439
SYSTEM TO CAPITAL OUTLAY

00:42:22.506 --> 00:42:24.642
PROJECTS --

00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:27.444
ABSOLUTION ROW HI I CENTER I

00:42:27.511 --> 00:42:29.680
WENT TO A CITRUS COLLEGE LOVED

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:32.950
IT A GREAT SCHOOL --

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:34.351
TOOK FIFTEEN UNITS.

00:42:34.418 --> 00:42:35.519
A SEMESTER AND THEN AND THERE IN

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:37.121
THE SUMMER SCHOOL I WOULD.

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:39.056
TRY TO TAKE A FEW MORE HOURS.

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:40.958
FORTUNATE TO GET THROUGH IN TWO

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:42.826
YEARS AND I WORK THIRTY TWO

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:44.261
HOURS A WEEK RIGHT YOU KNOW.

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:45.596
ON THE U. KIND OF MAKE IT SOUND

00:42:45.663 --> 00:42:47.298
LIKE A NEGATIVE THING I'M TRYING.

00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:48.832
TO RIGHT COULD YOU WALK ME

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:50.668
THROUGH THERE BECAUSE BACK IN

00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:53.003
THOSE DAYS THEY DIDN'T HAVE

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.939
THESE PROGRAMS AND I DON'T THINK

00:42:55.005 --> 00:42:56.840
IT WAS A HARDSHIP MAYBE IT

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:58.475
DEVELOP CHARACTER AND ME I'M.

00:42:58.542 --> 00:43:00.544
SURE BUT IF YOU WOULD.

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:02.346
SO -- IF THE

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:05.516
FIRST THING I'D SAY IS AT I ALSO.

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:07.151
WORK MY ENTIRE TIME THROUGH

00:43:07.217 --> 00:43:08.852
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND IT UC

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.321
IRVINE --

00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:12.523
RAISING A FAMILY AS WELL SO THE

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:14.325
ISSUE IS AND WHETHER OR NOT.

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:15.960
OUR STUDENTS SHOULD --

00:43:16.026 --> 00:43:17.428
FIND WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR

00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:19.530
EDUCATION THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY

00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:20.197
ARE.

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:22.700
PREDOMINATELY ALL OUR TO THE

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:24.134
DETRIMENT OF THEIR OWN EDUCATION

00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:26.036
BECAUSE OF THE COST OF ATTENDING

00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:27.438
COLLEGE TODAY --

00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:29.840
WE HAVE A HUGE --

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:32.676
HOUSING AND SECURITY PER FOOD

00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:33.677
AND SECURITY PROBLEMS IN THE

00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:36.747
STATE THE COST OF LIVING HAS.

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:38.716
RISEN TREMENDOUSLY CERTAINLY

00:43:38.782 --> 00:43:40.351
MORE THAN MY TIME GOING TO BE A

00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:41.852
COLLEGE AND AND YES --

00:43:41.919 --> 00:43:43.921
MANY OF OUR STUDENTS DO EXACTLY

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:45.856
WHAT YOU DO TODAY.

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:47.858
THE THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:50.160
THAT -- THEY

00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:53.230
DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ACCESS TO

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:54.398
ADDITIONAL FORMS OF FINANCIAL

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:56.367
AID THAT ALLOW THEM TO WORK AND

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.634
TO RECEIVE SOME SUPPORT SO THEY

00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:59.536
CAN GET THROUGH AS QUICKLY.

00:43:59.603 --> 00:44:01.171
AS POSSIBLE --

00:44:01.238 --> 00:44:03.140
SO -- YOU

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:05.409
KNOW. FOR FOR FOR US --

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:06.810
I MEAN WHETHER YOU'RE IN

00:44:06.877 --> 00:44:08.145
COMMITTEE COLLEGE --

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:10.047
CS YOUR UC THERE IS AN

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:11.382
EXPECTATION THAT THE FAMILY OR

00:44:11.448 --> 00:44:13.150
THE INDIVDUAL OR CONTRIBUTE TO

00:44:13.217 --> 00:44:15.486
THEIR EDUCATION WE'RE NOT ASKING

00:44:15.552 --> 00:44:16.687
FOR OUR STUDENTS TO BE TREATED

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:17.588
ANY DIFFERENTLY.

00:44:17.654 --> 00:44:20.357
WERE ASKING IS THAT THEY HAVE

00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:22.159
ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL AID TO HELP

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:23.861

ECONOMY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:29.700
WE THINK THAT THAT'S A WISE

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:31.402
INVESTMENT BECAUSE IF THEY'RE IN.

00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:33.337
THE WORK FORCE WITHIN THREE

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:34.872
YEARS NOT SIX YEARS THEN THEY'RE

00:44:34.938 --> 00:44:37.074
CONTRIBUTING IN A MEANINGFUL WAY

00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:38.542
TO THEIR FAMILIES THE OTHER

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:40.244
ISSUE IS.

YOU KNOW WE WERE WERE LIVING%

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:43.447

DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION

00:44:44.882 --> 00:44:46.350
CREDENTIAL IS MUCH GREATER THAN

00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:47.985
IT EVER HAS BEEN IN THE HISTORY

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:51.321
OF OUR ECONOMY --

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:54.792
6465% OF ALL ANGEL.

00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:57.494
AND SO WE'RE ASKING A LOT MORE

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:58.562
PEOPLE.

00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:02.699

SO -- WELL.

00:45:10.074 --> 00:45:12.142
WE WE BELIEVE IN AND CERTAINLY

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:13.610
IT'S A CASE BASED ON ALL THE

00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:14.978
DATA THAT WE SEE.

00:45:15.045 --> 00:45:16.814

SO.

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.587
THE WAY THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING

00:50:57.654 --> 00:50:59.523
THAT WITHIN THAT CONTEXT AND

00:50:59.589 --> 00:51:00.724
WITHIN THAT CONTEXT IT IS OUR

00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:02.092
INTENT TO THEN EXPANDED

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:03.727
THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM.

00:51:03.794 --> 00:51:06.263
IS IN I'LL TAKE ONE EXAMPLES --

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:07.664
IN HEALTH CARE --

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:09.166
WE HAVE BROUGHT TOGETHER A

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:11.334
COALITION OF HEALTHCARE

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:13.703
PROVIDERS LIKE DIGNITY OPTUM

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.205
KAISER AND OTHERS.

00:51:15.272 --> 00:51:19.409
pSEIU -- AND

00:51:19.476 --> 00:51:20.877
THE UNITED HEALTHCARE WORKERS

00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:24.581
AND PUT THEM AT THE SAME TABLE --

00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:26.249
LOOKED AT THE JOB SAID IN THE

00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:27.617
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THE

00:51:27.684 --> 00:51:30.086
EMPLOYER IS EITHER --

00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:32.489
WHERE THERE'S A GAP OVER THE IN

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:35.692
FUTURE YEARS AND THEN --

00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:37.961
WORKING BACKWARDS LOOKING AT THE

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:39.262
SKILLS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR

00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:41.498
AND THEN BUILDING A MODULE FOR

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:42.833
THE WORKER AND THEN TESTING THAT

00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:44.134
OUT WITH THE WORKER.

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:45.802
AND ALONG THE LINE ENSURING THAT

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:47.437
THERE IS A CLEAR SIGNALING

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:49.139
MECHANISM BETWEEN.

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:51.074
THE EDUCATION THAT THE WORKERS

00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:52.876
BEING PROVIDED AND DEMONSTRATING

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:54.611
SUCCESS IN AND THE HIRING

TO TO SMOOTH OUT SO THE LINK THE

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:11.628
THE CHALLENGE THAT WE SEE IS THE

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:13.396
TIME IT TAKES FOR THAT SIGNALING

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:15.398
TO OCCUR AND IN MANY CASES ARE

00:52:15.465 --> 00:52:16.867
OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS ARE NOT

00:52:16.933 --> 00:52:18.768
EITHER SIGNALING CLEARLY OR

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:20.871
TAKING TOO MUCH TIME. TO CATCH

00:52:20.937 --> 00:52:23.807
UP WITH THE SKILLS THAT THE

BUT IT WAS ALSO A SIX YEAR

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:29.872
INVESTMENT THAT EVERY YEAR OVER

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:31.174
THE COURSE OF SIX YEARS WE WOULD

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.010
INVEST SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:34.243
DOLLARS.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:35.845
IN ORDER TO MEET THAT.

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.480
AND SO WE'RE NOW --

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:39.549
SEEKING YEAR THREE OF THE SERIES

01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:40.850
OF INVESTMENTS TO TO REACH THAT

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:41.784
GOAL.

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:44.420
IF WE DON'T.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:45.888
GET SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:46.789
PROJECT.

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:48.224
THEY'RE NOT AN ISSUE WILL BE

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:49.592
DOWN REGULATED.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:50.893
IN A SORT OF SUCCESS THAT I'VE

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.361
BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT ON A

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:54.764
GRADUATION RATES --

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.999
EQUITY GAPS WILL BE DIMINISH.

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:58.301
YOU MEAN YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:00.303

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:01.737
I'M SURE SOMEONE CAN --

01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:03.406
CAN PUT TOGETHER SOME DATA OF

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:04.907
SOME IMPACT DATA.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.842
UNDER THE LEASE PROJECT IMPACTED

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:08.911
ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FORTY

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:09.946
FIVE MILLION SEVENTY FIVE

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:10.780
MILLION WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:04:10.846 --> 01:04:11.881
IMPACT ON THE GRADUATION

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:13.749
INITIATIVE I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:15.451
VERY HELPFUL.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:17.220
INFORMATION TO HAVE SO.

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:18.854
THAT THE FOLKS OF THE TO FOLKS

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:19.589
AROUND HERE IN THE FOLKS

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:21.891
DOWNSTAIRS CAN DO A COST BENEFIT

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.626
ANALYSIS ON THAT INVESTMENT.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:24.627
YEAH THEY'RE TO BE CLEAR

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:25.661
CONSEQUENCE ELEVEN YEARSTWO

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.163
THINGS IN THE GRANT INITIATIVE

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:28.097
TO COME TOGETHER.

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.699
AND WE'LL WE'LL PUT AN ANALYSIS

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:32.702
TOGETHER OF FOR YOU AND OTHERS.

IT'S NOT ONLY FOR US TO DO OUR

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:35.538
HEAVY LIFTING ON IMPROVING

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:37.373
GRADUATION RATES.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.574
BUT IT'S ALSO BY GIVING MORE

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:40.610

TIMES MORE STUDENTS AVAILING OF

01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:52.688
THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT LEADS TO

NEEDS AND SO YOU KNOW WE COULD

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:00.429
DO THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE AN

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:02.131
INCREASE OUR GRADUATION RATES.

STUDENTS TO BENEFIT BY THAT WILL

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:07.803
MISS THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:09.105
TO TREAT ACOMBINATION OF THE

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:10.740
TWO AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE.

01:05:10.806 --> 01:05:13.442
OF PUT FORWARD A 5% REQUEST FOR

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:14.310
ENROLLMENT AND WE PLAN TO DO

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:16.212
THAT FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IN

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:17.446
A ROW I ACTUALLY GREW THE

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:19.148
UNIVERSITY OVER 20% UNDERSTAND

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:21.017
IT'S AN INTEGRATED PROCESS HERE.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:22.852
IT IS AN INTEGRATED PROCESS THAT

01:05:22.918 --> 01:05:26.055
WITH WAS MAYBE YOU'VE TOUCHED ON

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:28.124
THIS AS WELL I SEE THE BUDGET --

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:29.692
THE BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:30.960
HAS A RATHER.

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:32.295
SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY GIVEN THE

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:34.497
ISSUE. TO REVIEW A OF A

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:37.033
POTENTIAL --

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:38.634
NEW CSU CAMPUS --

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:40.636
AND I I KNOW ONE OF MY

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:42.071
COLLEAGUES AS AN INTEREST IN.

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:43.973
ANOTHER SEE ISSUE CAMPUS IN

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.809
ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE.

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:48.311
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WITHIN

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:48.611
[inaudible]

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.279
SEE ISSUE.

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:52.481
CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK BRIEFLY

01:05:52.548 --> 01:05:55.584
ABOUT THAT TO ME. TO PUT IN

01:05:55.651 --> 01:05:57.353
PERSPECTIVE.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.688
OUR FACILITIES A COUPLE JUST

01:05:58.754 --> 01:06:00.323
GOOD SOUND BITES WE CAN GET YOU

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:02.391
MUCH MORE DETAIL YOUR OFFICE MAY

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:04.026
ALREADY HAVE IT.

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:07.029
I THINK OF 60% OF OUR BUILDING

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:08.397
INVENTORY IS THIRTY YEARS OR

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:09.932
OLDER.

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:12.301
AND I THINK SOMETHING LIKE 50%

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:14.503
OR OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:16.505
IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO VISUALIZE

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:18.474
HOW MANY BUILDINGS WE HAVE.

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:20.443
IMAGINE A FOOTBALL FIELD.

01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:22.445
IMAGINE ONE THOUSAND FOUR

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:23.346
HUNDRED FOOTBALL FIELDS.

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:25.281
THAT'S THE SIZE OF THE

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:27.750
FACILITIES AT THE UNIVERSITY --

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:28.784
SO THE OLD AND THERE'S A LOT OF

01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:32.188
IT -- OUR

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:34.457
STAFF UNDER EXECUTIVE ICE YET TO

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:36.525
REALLY A AND VICE SAN JUAN.

01:06:36.592 --> 01:06:40.629
HAVE A BIG ANALYTICAL UP.

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:42.365
MACHINE ROLE LOOKS AT THESE

01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:44.266
FACILITY NEEDS LOOKS AT THE

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:45.368
USAGE OR AGE.

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:46.936
ALL THE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:49.405
DION GLAMOUR STUFF OF EACH BACK

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:50.606
IN.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.141
WATER IN GENERAL.

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:54.110
SO WE HAVE A HUGE LIST OF

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:54.910
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR THE

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:56.545
UNIVERSITY OF THINGS THAT NEED

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:57.446
ATTENTION.

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:58.614
AND IF YOU ADD UP THE DOLLAR

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.582
AMOUNT FOR THAT IN TODAY'S

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:02.785
DOLLARS IT'S FOUR BILLION

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.353
DOLLARS.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.389
FOR BUILDING A TO BE.

01:07:06.455 --> 01:07:08.124
AND SO WHEN WE WHEN WE MAKE

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:10.359
REPLIED TO GET TWO HUNDRED AND

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:11.394
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:11.994
THAT.

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:13.396
WE HAVE A MUCH BIGGER HILL TO

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:14.430
CLIMB HERE.

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:15.364
AND IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO FOR A

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:18.667
FOR ALL OF US POLICY ISSUE FOR

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:19.335
THE STATE IS.

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:20.970
THESE ARE ASSETS OF THE STATE IS

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.872
INVESTED IN OVER.

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.573
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.342
AND IF YOU LEAD A BUILDING GET

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:27.810
TO SUCH A POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:29.278
RE HABIT IT'S MUCH MORE

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:31.080
EXPENSIVE OF COURSE TO REBUILD

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:33.349
THOSE BUILDINGS IT. EIGHT

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:33.983
HUNDRED OR NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:07:34.049 --> 01:07:34.750
A SQUARE FOOT.

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.786
SO OF THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:38.387
THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH RESPECT

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:39.488
TO THINKING ABOUT A GENERAL

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:40.890
OBLIGATION BOND OR SOMETHING OF

01:07:40.956 --> 01:07:41.991
THIS NATURE.

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:43.659
TO ACTUALLY TAKE ON THE FACILITY

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.394
ISSUE BECAUSE OUR STUDENTS.

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:46.829
A NEED DESERVES THE STATE

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.864
EXPECTS US TO HAVE LEARNING AND

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:50.833
DISCOVERY FACILITIES THE TWENTY

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.067
FIRST CENTURY SOURCE TUNE TO

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:52.735
LEARNING IN.

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:55.771
IN IN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT.

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:57.106
SO -- ONE

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:58.274
TIME FUNDING IT DID WHAT THE

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.576
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED IS HELPFUL

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:01.811
BUT THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:02.978
HERE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:04.346
WORKING WITH YOU AND OTHERS ON

TO FIND A SOLUTION TO WELL AS

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:10.219
YOU KNOW THE CAR UNFORTUNATELY

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:11.387
CALIFORNIA BUDGET GOES UP AND

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:11.587
DOWN.

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:14.924
AND GENERAL FUND AVAILABILITY

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:17.393
GOES UP AND DOWN HAS IS.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.061
ZERO THE STRIKE TEAM THAT'S BEEN

01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:20.729
FOR I'M SURE INSIDE YOUR

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:23.065
ORGANIZATION YOU YOU STUDY THESE

01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:25.067
ISSUES AND DEBATE THEM AND TRY

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:26.168
TO FIGURE THEM OUT BUT IS THERE.

01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:28.737
BEEN A LARGER STRIKE TEAM FORMED

01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:29.705
TO DISCUSS.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.407
HIGHER EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:34.076
IN THE STATE TO TRY TO FIGURE

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:36.445
OUT HOW WE HOW WE GET THE MONEY

01:08:36.512 --> 01:08:38.447
THAT WE NEED TO DO AND OVER WHAT

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:40.249
PERIOD OF TIME IN ORDER TO FIX

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:42.351
THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS THAT

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:44.153
WE HAVE NOT ONLY AT C. ISSUE BUT

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.120
I'M SURE.

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:46.021
YOU RECEIVE CALIFORNIA HAS THE

01:08:46.088 --> 01:08:49.325
SAME WELL LIT THE SECTORS HAVE

01:08:49.391 --> 01:08:50.226
BEEN WORKING AND TALKING

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.827
TOGETHER NON PRESIDENT AWAYS

01:08:51.894 --> 01:08:54.063
FROM THIS ISSUE --

01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:55.197
WERE OF THE THREE OF US ARE ALL

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:56.699
PART OF A GROUP CALLED THE

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:57.800
EDUCATION ROUNDTABLE THAT.

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:59.068
CAME OUT OF THE GOVERNOR BROWN

01:08:59.134 --> 01:09:00.803
ADMINISTRATION WERE WE'VE BEEN

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:01.904
TALKING ABOUT OF ALL THE THINGS

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:04.206
CAN ALONG WITH.

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:06.375
WITH THE TO PRINT AND THURMOND

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:07.743
UP ALONG WITH ALL OF THE THINGS

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.345
ARE CONFRONTING THE EDUCATION

01:09:09.411 --> 01:09:11.280
ECOSYSTEM AND FACILITIES. FOR

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:14.717
THE UC AND CSU HE'LL HAVE --

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:15.784
NOT HAD A GENERAL OBLIGATION

01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:17.620
BOND FOR EXAMPLE SINCE TWO

01:09:17.686 --> 01:09:19.688
THOUSAND AND SIX SO WE HAVE

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:21.156
ACTUALLY BEEN THEN DIVERTING

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:23.826
OPERATING FUNDS TO DEBT SERVICE.

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.361
TO DO THE NECESSARY MAINTENANCE

01:09:25.427 --> 01:09:26.762
ON THE WORST OF THE WORST.

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:29.098
THAT IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE PLAN

01:09:29.164 --> 01:09:30.699
FOR US UP.

01:09:30.766 --> 01:09:32.301
ONLY SUSTAINABLE FOOD IF WE

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.503
DECREASE OUR ENROLLMENT AND STOP

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:36.505
THIS GRADUATION IS WOULD TAKE

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:37.139
CARE OF OUR BUILDINGS OPERATING

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:38.207
FUNDS.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:39.141
SEEMS TO US THAT'S NOT IN THE

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:40.809

STUDENT SERVICES FEE THIS WAS

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:53.408
PUT INTO AYE TO MEET THAT --

SUGGESTS --

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:05.820
IN OUR STUDY SUGGESTED THAT

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:08.256
THERE IS A OVERWHELMING NEED FOR

01:22:08.323 --> 01:22:10.158

CHESSER OAKLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:07.849
SYSTEM AS TO WHETHER THE FUNDING

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:09.951
IS SUFFICIENT --

01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:10.785
I WOULD NOT CENTER OFF THE DEBT

01:23:10.852 --> 01:23:13.188
THE GOVERNOR ALSO DID DID PUT IN

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:13.755
FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:14.723
BASIC NEEDS.

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:16.224
AND WHILE WE DO WE HAVE CRITICAL

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:18.126

THE FOOD INSECURITY IN HOUSING

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:20.995
IT SECURITY WHICH WE WILL BE

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:22.497
USING THESE FUNDS TO MEET THE

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:23.598
STUDENT COMMITTEES THAT PUT THIS

MAINTENANCE AND FACILITY NEEDS

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:44.853
TO USE THE ACTION THAT I BELIEVE

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:46.154
THAT IT COULD YOU GO INTO A

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:47.122
LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL THE

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:48.690
BUDGET CURRENTLY PROVIDES A

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.358
HUNDRED AND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY

01:23:50.425 --> 01:23:50.992
EIGHT MILLION A ONE TIME GENERAL

SO THAT IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:56.431
A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:58.933
ADS YEAH I KNOW YOU'RE GRATEFUL --

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.335
TO IT WE HAVE A PROGRAM UNDER

01:24:00.402 --> 01:24:01.669
WAY THAT IS TRYING TO

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:04.005
STANDARDIZE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE --

01:24:04.072 --> 01:24:05.840
ACROSS OUR CAMPUSES --

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:07.308
IT'S CALLED AYE CAMP --

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:09.677
AND IT IS IT LOOKS AT AS IS

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:11.279
CHANCE WHITE WAS SAYING --

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:12.547
THE AGE OF THE BUILDINGS WHAT

01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:14.048
INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE THE

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:16.785
TYPES OF SYSTEMS THEY HAVE --

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:17.886
YOU KNOW THE EQUIVALENT

01:24:17.952 --> 01:24:19.687
CONTINUES OCCUPANCY OF THOSE

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:21.923
BUILDINGS AND TRYING TO GET BOTH

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.425
A OVERALL NUMBER.

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:25.927
BUT ALSO A A PRIORITIZATION

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:28.096
HARDLY TRIAGE --

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:28.696
HOW WE'RE GONNA SPEND THAT TO

01:24:28.763 --> 01:24:32.167
GIVE US MORE --

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:32.734
YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE'RE NOT

01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:33.635
FINISHED WITH THAT BUT IF YOU

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:35.036
EXTRAPOLATE THE NEED FOR STATE

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:36.771
ELIGIBLE BILLINGS IS ABOUT FOUR

01:24:36.838 --> 01:24:38.406
POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS --

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:40.074
WE HAVE A SIMILAR AMOUNT FOR NON

01:24:40.141 --> 01:24:41.409
STATE ELIGIBLE BUT WE HAVE OTHER

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:43.144
REVENUE SOURCES YOU KNOW HOUSING

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:44.779
REVENUES MEDICAL CENTER --

01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:45.814
REVENUES OTHER AUXILIARY

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:49.083
REVENUES TO HELP SUPPORT THAT SO --

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:51.586
WE YOU KNOW I I I SHARE --

01:24:51.653 --> 01:24:52.287
CHANCE OR WITH --

01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:54.155
WHITE VIEW THAT --

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:55.790
THESE -- ONE

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:57.058
TIME FUNDS ARE INCREDIBLY

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.726
IMPORTANT TO US BUT WE ALSO TO

01:24:58.793 --> 01:25:01.629
GET AHEAD OF THE THE ISSUE --

01:25:01.696 --> 01:25:03.665
WOULD BE LOOKING FOR A GEO BOND

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:04.265
ON THE BALLOT AND THAT'S NOT

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.600
JUST TO SERVE --

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:08.970
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUT ALSO --

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:09.504
WE ALSO DOING NEW SEISMIC

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:12.674
STUDIES ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.276
CODES WE DO NEED O UPGRADE --

01:25:15.343 --> 01:25:16.144
A LOT OF THOSE BUILDINGS AS WELL

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:17.946
SO THE NON STATE OWNED OF

01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:19.280
FACILITIES THE MEDICAL CENTERS I

01:25:19.347 --> 01:25:20.648
ASSUME THEY HAVE A REVENUE

01:25:20.715 --> 01:25:21.516
STREAM THAT.

01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:23.651
CAN SUPPORT --

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.286
AS AS MANY OF OUR AUXILIARIES IN

01:25:25.353 --> 01:25:26.588
SUMMER RESEARCH THAT YOU KNOW IS

01:25:26.654 --> 01:25:27.388
SUPPORTED BY INDIRECT COST

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:29.023
RECOVERY NOT STATE FUNDS BUT THE

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:31.860
PRIMARY FOCUS IS A FOUR POINT

01:25:31.926 --> 01:25:32.494
FOUR BILLION ON THE STATE OWNED

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.461
EXACTLY.

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:34.829
WESLEY --

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:36.397
THE TUITION INCREASE IN OR NO

01:25:36.464 --> 01:25:38.666
TUITION INCREASE THAT'S FOR IN

01:25:38.733 --> 01:25:40.101
STATE STUDENTS THAT'S IN STATE.

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:40.768
SO.

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:42.470
I ASSUME THAT WITH RESPECT OUT

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:43.705
OF STATE STUDENTS.

01:25:43.771 --> 01:25:45.340
TUITION INCREASE COULD BE

01:25:45.406 --> 01:25:47.041
IMPLEMENTED WE HAVE A ON THE

01:25:47.108 --> 01:25:49.477
MARCH A BALLOT WE HAVE A TUITION

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:50.778
INCREASE FOR NON RESIDENTS UP

01:25:50.845 --> 01:25:52.080
WILL TUITION.

01:25:52.146 --> 01:25:53.615
THAT'S A PEGGED AT INFLATION A

01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:56.985
TWO POINT 6% --

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:58.620
INCREASE.

01:25:58.686 --> 01:26:01.055
ON THE MARCH A MARCH REGIONS --

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:03.057
GENDER YEAH I'M SORRY IN THE

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:03.958
BALLOT.

01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:04.592
SO.

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:05.527
THAT DOES CREATE SOME FUNDING

01:26:05.593 --> 01:26:06.828
DISPARITY AMONG THE CAMPUSES

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:09.631
CORRECT GIVEN THE PERCENTAGES OF

01:26:09.697 --> 01:26:10.832
OUT OF STATE STUDENTSTHAT SOME

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:13.067
HAVE VERSUS THE PERCENTAGES THAT

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:14.469
OTHER CAMPUSES HAVE.

01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:15.637
THAT IS CORRECT YEAH NON

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:17.405
RESIDENT TUITION STAYS ON THE

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:19.007
CAMPUS WHERE IT'S GENERATED IS

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:20.141
THERE ANY.

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:22.477
IS THERE ANY THOUGHT TO REVISIT

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:25.947
THE WAY THAT MONEY IS ALLOCATED --

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:26.981
TO DEAL WITH THOSE CAMPUSES THAT

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:27.916
DON'T --

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:29.450
AREN'T ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:31.352
WHATEVER IT IS 20% --

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:32.420
THE STATE'S STUDENT ENROLLMENT

01:26:32.487 --> 01:26:34.522
YEAH WE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:35.290
ABOUT --

01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:36.958
DIFFERENT AND AS SOON JUST NOT

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.993
TO INTERRUPT I JUST DID --

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.628
BUT TO I SING THAT REALLY

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:41.362
RELATES --

TO YOU KNOW YOU SEE MERCED

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:46.267
PERHAPS.

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:47.001
MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER ONE IN

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:48.036
THERE SOMEWHERE.

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:49.671
YEAH ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT IT

01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:50.405
NOW -- YOU

01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:51.506
KNOW WE DOCTORED THE CAP ON

01:26:51.573 --> 01:26:53.808
ANDREAS ENROLLMENT AT 18% TWO

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.376
YEARS AO THERE ARE FOUR

01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:57.879
CAMPUSES IRVINE SAN DIEGO --

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:59.380
BURKE IN UCLA THAT WERE ABOVE

01:26:59.447 --> 01:27:01.249
THAT CAPS OR IN THE LOW --

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:04.052
20% RANGE DAVIS JUST HIT THE 18%

01:27:04.118 --> 01:27:05.119
CAP.

IN SINGLE DIGITS WITH MERCED AT

01:27:15.997 --> 01:27:17.932
BASICALLY AT AT ZERO EITHER A

01:27:17.999 --> 01:27:20.435
LOT OF DISPARITIES IN IN --

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:21.669
NONTRADITIONAL --

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:22.670
REVENUES --

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.572
AT OUR CAMPUS IS IT'S NOT JUST

01:27:24.639 --> 01:27:26.074
NON RESIDENT TUITION ITS PATENT

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.542
REVENUES IT'S INDIRECT COSTS

01:27:27.609 --> 01:27:32.280
REVENUES FROM RESEARCH IT IS --

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:34.682
MED CENTER REVENUES --

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:36.584
AT A DIFFERENT INSTITUTION AND I

01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:38.653
I WORKED ON A EFFORT TO TRY TO

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.288
NORMALIZE THAT FUNDING WAS

01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:42.557
CALLED RE BENCHING. EIGHT YEARS

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:47.028
AGO OR SEVEN YEARS AGO.

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:48.363
YEAH -- BUT

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:49.397
I IT BY DOT YOU KNOW I THINK A

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:50.765
LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT IS TIME

01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:52.100
TO REVISIT THAT GIVEN YOU KNOW

01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:53.101
THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF GROWTH IN

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:54.669
THOSE OTHER REVENUE SOURCES.

01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:55.837
AND YOU KNOW AND KEPT WISHIN

01:27:55.903 --> 01:27:59.007
FLAT SO CAMPUS LIKE RIVERSIDE IS

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:00.675
MORE TUITION DEPENDENT THAN

01:28:00.742 --> 01:28:01.909
ALMOST ANY CAMPUS WE HAVE.

01:28:01.976 --> 01:28:03.845
AND I WAS JUST I MEAN THERE'S A

01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:05.747
LOT OF PRESSURE HERE PRESSURE

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:08.883
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING. TO KEEP.

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:11.352
IN STATE TUITION FLAT.

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:12.587
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE

01:28:12.654 --> 01:28:14.589
UNDERSTAND THE REASONS.

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:16.824
FOR BUT THE THEN THAT CREATES

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:18.426
THIS FUNDING DISPARITY.

01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:21.362
THAT IN SOME WAYS AND SOMETIMES

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:23.064
IN SOME CASES THE STATE CAN'T

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.899
SIMPLY MAKE UP. TO THESE

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:27.402
CAMPUSES THROUGH AN INCREASE OF

01:28:27.468 --> 01:28:29.404
THE GENERAL FUND AND THERE YOU

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:30.938
ALL REALLY ON A TAKE A LOOK AT

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:32.507
THAT AND SEE IF AS A POLICY

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:34.909
MATTER THAT IS APPROPRIATE NOW.

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:36.044
HOW DOES RETURN I I THINK AS A

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:38.179
POLICY MATTER I MEAN I WOULD

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:39.447
JUST REMIND THE COMMITTEE?

01:28:39.514 --> 01:28:41.549
YOUR 57% OF OUR STUDENTS PAY NO

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:42.216
TUITION.

01:28:42.283 --> 01:28:46.587
AND TUITION IS A PRIME WHAT WE

01:28:46.654 --> 01:28:48.356
CALL RETURNED EIGHT THROUGH WE

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.991
KEEP TUITION FLAT THAT BASIC THE

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:51.292
KEEPS THE FINANCIAL AID POOL

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:55.263
FLAT. FOR ALL THE OTHER --

01:28:55.329 --> 01:28:56.564
NON TUITION --

01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:58.633
COST YOU KNOW AS AS CHANCER SO

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.435
CLEAN WHITE NOTED THE COST OF

01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:02.970
HOUSING THE COST OF BOOKS ACOSTA

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:04.105
FOOD.

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:07.175
AND SO YOU KNOW IN ESSENCE --

01:29:07.241 --> 01:29:08.676
OUR FINANCIAL AID --

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:11.579
POOL IS GOING DOWN WE WHEN WE DO

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:12.480
THAT AND WE THINK UP.

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:13.081
YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:13.614
HISTORY OF JEWISH AT THE

01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:15.049
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE GO

01:29:15.116 --> 01:29:16.284
THROUGH LONG PERIODS OF KEEPING

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:18.186
IT FLAT AND IT'S DOUBLE DIGIT

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:19.954
AND WE THINK A A BETTER POLICY

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:21.656
APPROACH WOULD BE HAVING A YOU

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:22.323
KNOW --

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:24.225
INFLATION BASED MODERATE TUITION

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:25.560
WHERE YOU KEPT.

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.161
THE REAL COST OF EDUCATION FLAT

01:29:27.228 --> 01:29:28.496
BUT JUST GREW UP WITH INFLATION

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:30.698
WELL I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:32.934
THAT AND YOU KNOW WE FEEL A LOT

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:33.868
OF PRESSURES FROM A LOT OF

01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:35.870
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WHEN YOU

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:37.572
WORK IN THE SPELLING OF AND ALL

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:38.873
I'M ASKING WITH RESPECT TO THIS

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:40.208
PARTICULAR POINT IS PERHAPS.

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:41.375
THE REGION'S COULD TAKE A LOOK

01:29:41.442 --> 01:29:42.577
AT THAT GIVEN THE CURRENT

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:44.946
POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN WE'RE

01:29:45.012 --> 01:29:45.713
CERTAIN PIECE OF THE STUDENT

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:48.416
POPULATION.

01:29:48.483 --> 01:29:51.819
YES SUBJECT TO A FEE INCREASE IN.

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:52.787
THE RESTAURANT NOT AND YOU HAVE

01:29:52.854 --> 01:29:54.789
THESE WIDE DISPARITIES AMONG TWO

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:56.457
CAMPUSES AS TO HOW MANY OTHER

01:29:56.524 --> 01:29:57.625
STATES STUDENTS.

01:29:57.692 --> 01:29:59.460
THEY HAVE AN OLDER OR ARE ABLE

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:03.097
TO ENROLL --

01:30:03.164 --> 01:30:04.999
ANYWAY QUESTIONS THE RIVER.

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:06.601
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BUT NOT

01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:08.102
REALLY A QUESTION MORE OF AN

01:30:08.169 --> 01:30:10.404
IDEA -- SO

01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:12.273
IT SEEMS THE CROSS ALL OF OUR

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:14.108
OUR CAMPUSES FOOD AND HOUSING

01:30:14.175 --> 01:30:15.743
AND SECURITY IS A PROBLEM.

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:19.814
AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW TO MY-COLLEAGUES POINT THAT YOU KNOW I

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:21.415
I ALSO WORK FULL TIME WHEN I WAS

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:23.017
IN SCHOOL BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:23.985
FOR EVERYONE --

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:25.253
AND I ALSO LIVED AT HOME I

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:26.821
WASN'T SUPPORTING MYSELF IT WAS

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:27.722
MUCH DIFFERENT.

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:28.890
SO I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO

01:30:28.956 --> 01:30:30.825
LOOK AT THAT BUT I ALSO --

01:30:30.892 --> 01:30:31.826
ONE I WANT TO SHOUT OUT TO THE

01:30:31.893 --> 01:30:33.494
GOVERNOR SO MUCH APPRECIATE THAT

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:34.996
HE PUT THE MONEY AND BEFORE WE

01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:36.631
HAD A REALLY LOBBY HIM HARD

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:39.500
WHICH IS PRETTY AWESOME SHE DOES

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:40.234
FEEL THE SAME WAY.

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:41.135
BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE US TO

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:43.037
THINK ABOUT --

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:44.138
AFTER THIS MY FIFTH YEAR IN THE

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:45.640
LEGISLATURE AFTER ABOUT COUPLE

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:47.175
YEARS I SAID TO MY STAFF I SAID

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:48.676
HOW COME THE C. ISSUES COME

01:30:48.743 --> 01:30:50.111
EVERY YEAR AND ASK US FOR MONEY.

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:51.612
WHY HAVEN'T WE FIGURED OUT A

01:30:51.679 --> 01:30:53.047
FUNDING STREAM FOR THEM YET?

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:54.182
SO I FEEL LIKE WE REALLY NEED TO

01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:57.151
DO SO I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GUYS

01:30:57.218 --> 01:30:58.452
PLAN YOUR BUDGET WONDERING EVERY

01:30:58.519 --> 01:31:00.254
YEAR WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE --

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:01.989
WHEN I WAS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT

01:31:02.056 --> 01:31:03.825
AND WE NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS EVEN

01:31:03.891 --> 01:31:05.126
THE EMPLOYERS WHO DIDN'T LOVE

01:31:05.193 --> 01:31:06.928
BEING UNDER UNION CONTRACTS SAID

01:31:06.994 --> 01:31:08.596
WE APPRECIATE KNOWING THREE OR

01:31:08.663 --> 01:31:10.331
FOUR YEARS WHAT OUR COSTS ARE

01:31:10.398 --> 01:31:11.299
GOING TO BE?

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:12.767
SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THROW

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:15.036
OUT THERE WE AS A COMMITTEE AND

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:17.238
AS THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD LOOK

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:18.539
AT HOW DO WE FIND.

01:31:18.606 --> 01:31:21.943
FUNDING OR MAYBE EVEN A FOR TWO

01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:23.711
OR THREE YEARS OUT SO THAT YOU

01:31:23.778 --> 01:31:25.479
GUYS COMPLAINED BETTER SOME I'M

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:26.080
JUST GONNA THROW THAT UP FOR

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:27.882
CONSIDERATION I APPRECIATE ALL

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:29.884
OF YOU BEING HERE AND WHAT YOU

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.552
DO EVERY DAY AS WELL.

01:31:31.619 --> 01:31:34.722
WE WOULD WELCOME.

01:31:34.789 --> 01:31:37.825
A MULTI YEAR APPROACH FOR A

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:39.427
VARIETY OF REASONS.

01:31:39.493 --> 01:31:42.129
THE NOTION OF WHEN I RAIN

01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:43.731
CAMPUSES.

01:31:43.798 --> 01:31:45.533
YOU SEE AN AN IN OTHER PLACES IN

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:46.901
THE COUNTRY.

01:31:46.968 --> 01:31:50.004
IF YOU CAN BE MUCH WISER USERS

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:52.173
OF THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE.

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:53.774
IF THEY ARE PREDICTABLE.

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:55.276
SUSTAINABLE AND HOPEFULLY

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:58.546
SUFFICIENT.

01:31:58.613 --> 01:32:00.882
THIS LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE --

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:01.916
YOU KNOW WE STARTED IN PRETTY

01:32:01.983 --> 01:32:03.918
DEEP HOLE IN THIS BUILDING WAS

01:32:03.985 --> 01:32:06.621
THE GOVERNOR BROWN'S NINETY TWO

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:07.255
MILLION DOLLARS FOR US AGAINST

01:32:07.321 --> 01:32:09.390
OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:10.524
SOMETHING ASK.

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.159
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE BILL WAS

01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:14.462
SIGNED IN JUNE WHEN WE'VE MADE

01:32:14.528 --> 01:32:16.631
PROGRESS AGAINST THAT INITIAL

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:18.933
INTRODUCTORY BUDGET.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.401
WAS LIKE WE'D ALREADY MADE ALL

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:21.736
THE ADMISSIONS DECISIONS WITH

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:23.838
THE EXPECTATION OF OF ACTUALLY

01:32:23.905 --> 01:32:26.240
HAVING A BUDGET CUTS.

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:28.075
AND IN AN OFFICE AND YOU GET

01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:30.978
THIS BOWLS OF MONEY PERMANENT

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:33.547
MONEY AND YOU GO OH CRAP.

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:34.415
WITH ALL THE STUDENTS NOW COMING.

01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:35.449
IN SO WE HUSTLE OUT THERE AND WE

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:37.551
FIND VERY CAPABLE THE TEMPORARY

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:40.254
FACULTY TO CREATE A CURRICULUM.

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:42.323
IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE IF YOU

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:43.691
KNEW THAT YOU COULD CLOTHING

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:45.226
HIGHER THE PERMIT PROFESSORIAL

01:32:45.293 --> 01:32:46.794
FACULTY.

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:48.095
KNOWING THE STUDENTS ARE COMING

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:51.098
BECAUSE OUR DATA ANALYTICS WE

01:32:51.165 --> 01:32:52.700
KNOW WHAT'S COMING.

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:54.635
AND IT WOULD BE SO FOR EVERY

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:55.870
DOLLAR WE GET WE CAN SPEND A

01:32:55.937 --> 01:32:57.138
MUCH MORE WISELY.

01:32:57.204 --> 01:32:58.973
AND HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES AND I

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.574
THINK THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE.

01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:02.343
I KNOW IT'S TRUE FOR THE UC IN

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:03.577
FOR THE COMMUNICABLE HIS A WEEK

01:33:03.644 --> 01:33:05.446
WE WOULD WELCOME A MULTI YEAR

01:33:05.513 --> 01:33:05.913
DISCUSSION [inaudible]

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:06.981
RIGHT.

01:33:07.048 --> 01:33:09.116
I AGREE AND THAT'S SOMETHING I

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:10.284
HOPE WE CAN WORK ON GOING

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:11.953
FORWARD.

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:14.221
GIVEN THE WIDE SWING WILD SWINGS

01:33:14.288 --> 01:33:15.957
IN WIDE SWINGS IN THE CALIFORNIA

01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:17.558
REVENUE STREAM IN OUR BUDGET

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:19.427
WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT.

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:21.062
HOW THAT WORKS --

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:23.331
I SUPPOSE IN IN PERIODS OF A RUN

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:24.799
UP WHERE YOU CAN EXPECT TO YOU

01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:26.834
KNOW SIX OR SEVEN YEAR RUN UP IN

01:33:26.901 --> 01:33:28.436
THE ECONOMY WE IT WOULD BE

01:33:28.502 --> 01:33:30.204
RELATIVELY EASY TO PEG THAT

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:32.340
NUMBER BUT ON WHEN WE'RE ON THE

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:34.875
DOWNWARD SLIDE I DON'T I DON'T.

01:33:34.942 --> 01:33:35.876
RIGHT HOW TO PICK THE NUMBER

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:37.244
PERHAPS THERE'SSOME RESERVE

01:33:37.311 --> 01:33:38.946
ACCOUNT THAT COULD BE USED TO

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:40.948
BALANCE OUT THE REVENUE FLOW.

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:41.983
THAT WE DON'T GET TO HAVE

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:44.218
EXPERIENCES BUDGETEERS BUT THAT

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:46.253

01:57:39.452 --> 01:57:40.853
THE THOUGHT OF QUARTERS FOR NEW

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.755
ONGOING SPENDING SOME OF THAT

01:57:42.822 --> 01:57:43.956
NEW ON GOING SPENDING AS

01:57:44.023 --> 01:57:46.225
ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH IN COSTS

01:57:46.292 --> 01:57:49.095
FROM PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED POLICIES.

01:57:49.162 --> 01:57:50.463
PAGE TWO IS ALL THE NINETY EIGHT

01:57:50.530 --> 01:57:51.731

OF THIS IS ONGOING.

01:57:55.935 --> 01:57:59.138
BUT IS SIGNIFICANT OUR TURN TO

01:57:59.205 --> 01:57:59.872
IT ALL MEANT.

01:57:59.939 --> 01:58:00.773
PAGE THREE IS ALL THE HIGHER%

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.009
EDUCATION PROPOSALS BOTH NINETY

01:58:03.075 --> 01:58:04.811
EIGHT AND NINE NINETY EIGHT

01:58:04.877 --> 01:58:06.979
ABOUT 30% SO THOUGHT ONE POINT

01:58:07.046 --> 01:58:09.549
FIVE BILLION LISTED AS ONE TIME.

01:58:09.615 --> 01:58:10.416
THE REMAINING IS ONGOING SO THE

01:58:10.483 --> 01:58:13.319
FIRST THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AS A

01:58:13.386 --> 01:58:14.854
WHOLE IS JUST THE ARCHITECTURE

01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:16.689

HE HAS TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION

01:58:23.095 --> 01:58:25.431
AND NON NINETY EIGHT FOR ALL

01:58:25.498 --> 01:58:27.166
OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET.

01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:29.001
OF THAT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION

01:58:29.068 --> 01:58:30.636
AND NINE NINETY EIGHT SPENDING

01:58:30.703 --> 01:58:32.271
ABOUT A BILLION IS IN THE

01:58:32.338 --> 01:58:33.539
EDUCATION AREA.

01:58:33.606 --> 01:58:35.575
SO OF THAT BILLION ABOUT SIX

01:58:35.641 --> 01:58:36.943
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AS FOR

01:58:37.009 --> 01:58:39.212
MORE UNIVERSITY AND AIDS FUNDING

MILLION IS FOR EARLY EDUCATION

01:58:42.048 --> 01:58:43.216
THE NUMBER I JUST HEARD ON A FEW

01:58:43.282 --> 01:58:44.383
PAGES AGO.

01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:45.418
SO THOSE ARE THE FIRST ORDER

01:58:45.485 --> 01:58:47.653
DECISIONS FOR YOU AS WE WENT

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:49.355
THROUGH OUR ANALYSIS OF THE

01:58:49.422 --> 01:58:50.690
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE IDENTIFIED

01:58:50.756 --> 01:58:52.291
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:58:52.358 --> 01:58:54.727
SOME MILLION AN ON GOING NINE

01:58:54.794 --> 01:58:56.028
NINETY EIGHT SPENDING THAT WE

01:58:56.095 --> 01:58:56.662
THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO RESET

01:58:56.729 --> 01:58:57.230
THAT.

01:58:57.296 --> 01:58:59.165
AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED SOME

01:58:59.232 --> 01:59:00.500
MILLION AND ONE TIMES FUNDING SO

01:59:00.566 --> 01:59:02.001
WE THINK THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES

01:59:02.068 --> 01:59:03.202
FOR YOU TO IMPROVE THE BUDGET

01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:04.770
MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT PUT YOUR

01:59:04.837 --> 01:59:07.340
STAMP ON IT.

01:59:07.406 --> 01:59:07.940
A HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THOSE IN A

01:59:08.007 --> 01:59:08.174
MOMENT.

01:59:08.241 --> 01:59:09.075
IN ADDITION TO ALL THE GENERAL

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:10.009
FUND SPENDING YOU'VE BEEN

01:59:10.076 --> 01:59:11.844
TALKING ALSO THIS MORNING ABOUT

01:59:11.911 --> 01:59:14.647
BOND FUNDED ACTIVITIES SO PAGE.

01:59:14.714 --> 01:59:16.382
FOR IS ALL OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY

01:59:16.449 --> 01:59:18.784
PROJECTS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION.

01:59:18.851 --> 01:59:20.720
THOSE PROJECTS ARE TYPICALLY RUN

01:59:20.786 --> 01:59:22.388
THROUGH THE BUDGET CYCLE HE

01:59:22.455 --> 01:59:23.456
TWELVE PROJECTS AREN'T LISTED

01:59:23.523 --> 01:59:25.057
HERE BECAUSE WE DON'T PUT THEM

01:59:25.124 --> 01:59:25.825
THROUGH THE BUDGET BUT THERE'S

01:59:25.892 --> 01:59:27.260
ANOTHER ONE AND A HALF BILLION

01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:29.061
IN PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE FUNDING

01:59:29.128 --> 01:59:30.129
FOR K..

01:59:30.196 --> 01:59:30.930
TWELVE YOU CAN SEE SOME

01:59:30.997 --> 01:59:32.365
DIFFERENCES IN APPROACH FOR

01:59:32.431 --> 01:59:33.566
EXAMPLE FOR THE COMMUNITY

01:59:33.633 --> 01:59:35.568
COLLEGES THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:59:35.635 --> 01:59:36.702
JUST FUNDING PLAN THEIR PLANS

01:59:36.769 --> 01:59:37.904
AND WORKING DRAWINGS THAT'S THE

01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:39.772
TRADITIONAL STATE APPROACHES TO

01:59:39.839 --> 01:59:42.708
DISCO PROJECT PHASE BY PHASE.

01:59:42.775 --> 01:59:44.610
FOR THE GET CSU ALL PHASES ARE

01:59:44.677 --> 01:59:46.812
BEING OF FINANCE SIMULTANEOUSLY

01:59:46.879 --> 01:59:48.247
AND FOR YOU SEE IT'S JUST THE

01:59:48.314 --> 01:59:49.348
CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF THEIR

01:59:49.415 --> 01:59:50.650
PROJECTS.

01:59:50.716 --> 01:59:51.651
BECAUSE I WAS CONVERSATION

01:59:51.717 --> 01:59:53.219
EARLIER THIS MORNING I JUST STOP

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:54.654
FOR A MOMENT IF THERE IS GOING

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:55.821
TO BE CONVERSATION OF THE NEW

01:59:55.888 --> 01:59:57.390
BONDS THAT WOULD INCLUDE HE

01:59:57.456 --> 01:59:58.758
UNIVERSITY IS --

01:59:58.824 --> 02:00:01.727
JUST AS A HISTORICAL REVIEW BACK

02:00:01.794 --> 02:00:03.596
IN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FOR YOU SEE

02:00:03.663 --> 02:00:05.965
AND BACK AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN

02:00:06.032 --> 02:00:07.133
FOR CSU THE STATE MADE A

02:00:07.199 --> 02:00:08.968
DECISION AT THAT TIME. TO TAKE

02:00:09.035 --> 02:00:11.170
THE STATE THAT SERVICE AMOUNT

02:00:11.237 --> 02:00:13.039
ROLL IT INTO THE UNIVERSITY'S

02:00:13.105 --> 02:00:15.474
MAIN SUPPORT ITEM SUCH THAT THEY

02:00:15.541 --> 02:00:16.842
WOULD HAVE --

02:00:16.909 --> 02:00:18.578
A BETTER CONVERSATION WAS THE

02:00:18.644 --> 02:00:19.979
THEORY ABOUT THE TRADE OFFS

02:00:20.046 --> 02:00:21.213
BETWEEN THEIR CAPITAL AND

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.583
SUPPORT BUDGETS SO IF YOU WERE

02:00:23.649 --> 02:00:24.150
TO WANT TO TAKE A DIFFERENT

02:00:24.216 --> 02:00:25.351
APPROACH ME FORWARD YOU MIGHT

02:00:25.418 --> 02:00:26.786
WANT TO REVISIT HOW MUCH OF

02:00:26.852 --> 02:00:27.954
THEIR EXISTING BUDGET IS GOING

02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:28.955
FOR DOT SERVICE.

02:00:29.021 --> 02:00:31.390
AT LEAST HAVE THAT AS ONE OF

02:00:31.457 --> 02:00:33.092
YOUR CONSIDERATIONS.

02:00:33.159 --> 02:00:33.726
SO THE REST OF THE HAND OUT IS

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:35.761
OUR ANALYSIS OF THE BUDGET SO

02:00:35.828 --> 02:00:36.596
PAGE FIVE IS --

02:00:36.662 --> 02:00:38.130
HIGHLIGHTING A FEW THINGS THAT

02:00:38.197 --> 02:00:40.333
YOU'LL HEAR MORE DEEPLY ABOUT IN

02:00:40.399 --> 02:00:41.767
THE EARLY ADDS DR.

02:00:41.834 --> 02:00:42.802
THE LARGEST OF THE GOVERNOR'S

02:00:42.868 --> 02:00:45.938
ONE TIME PROPOSED BROWN'S TRYING

02:00:46.005 --> 02:00:47.173
TO PROMOTE MORE FULL DAY

02:00:47.239 --> 02:00:49.508
PROGRAMS IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

02:00:49.575 --> 02:00:51.043
STATE STARTED THIS YEAR.

02:00:51.110 --> 02:00:52.378
SO WE WENT AND WE LOOKED AT THE

02:00:52.445 --> 02:00:54.580
FIRST ROUND APPLICATIONS FOR THE

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:55.114
HUNDRED MILLION THE STATE

02:00:55.181 --> 02:00:56.515
PROVIDED THIS YEAR.

02:00:56.582 --> 02:00:57.850
AND DISCOVERED THAT VIRTUALLY

02:00:57.917 --> 02:00:59.752
ALL OF IT IS GOING TO DISTRICTS

02:00:59.819 --> 02:01:01.487
WHO ALREADY RUN ONLY FULL DAY

02:01:01.554 --> 02:01:02.755
PROGRAMS.

02:01:02.822 --> 02:01:03.723
SO WE THINK THIS IS AN

02:01:03.789 --> 02:01:05.024
OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU MIGHT WANT

02:01:05.091 --> 02:01:06.892
TO REVISIT THE PROPOSAL YOU

02:01:06.959 --> 02:01:08.327
COULD USE IT FOR HIGHER RESERVES

02:01:08.394 --> 02:01:09.428
YOU COULD USE THAT FOR

02:01:09.495 --> 02:01:11.597
ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT

02:01:11.664 --> 02:01:12.665
PENSION PAYMENT.

02:01:12.732 --> 02:01:14.634
IF YOU DID ON THE LAST ONE TO DO

02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:16.636
SOMETHING IN IN THIS AREA WE

02:01:16.702 --> 02:01:18.004
WOULD SUGGEST YOU CREATE A FAR

02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:19.672
MORE TARGETED PROGRAM SO WHERE

02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:21.574
AS MOST OF THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

02:01:21.641 --> 02:01:22.541
MONEY IS GOING TO DISTRICTS THAT

02:01:22.608 --> 02:01:24.243
ALREADY RUN FULL DAY PROGRAMS.

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:25.478
YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT A

02:01:25.544 --> 02:01:27.546
MUCH MORE TARGETED PROGRAM IT

02:01:27.613 --> 02:01:28.681
WOULD ONLY BE FOR DISTRICTS

02:01:28.748 --> 02:01:30.850
RUNNING PART DAY PROGRAMS DUE TO

02:01:30.916 --> 02:01:31.717
FILL PHYLLIS FACILITY

02:01:31.784 --> 02:01:32.852
CONSTRAINTS.

02:01:32.918 --> 02:01:33.886
THAT COULDN'T BE ADDRESSED

02:01:33.953 --> 02:01:35.087
THROUGH THE STATE'S REGULAR

02:01:35.154 --> 02:01:36.822
SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM THAT

02:01:36.889 --> 02:01:37.790
WOULD BE THE ONE WAY YOU COULD

02:01:37.857 --> 02:01:39.091
TARGET AT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE

02:01:39.158 --> 02:01:40.226
GETTING WHAT YOU WANT.

02:01:40.292 --> 02:01:41.427
IT MIGHT BE THAT YOU COULD DO

02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:43.929
THAT FOR MUCH LESS MONEY THAN

02:01:43.996 --> 02:01:45.264
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION.

02:01:45.331 --> 02:01:46.999
THE SECOND LARGEST PROPOSALS THE

02:01:47.066 --> 02:01:47.800
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR CHILD

02:01:47.867 --> 02:01:50.069
CARE WORK FORCE AND FACILITIES.

02:01:50.136 --> 02:01:51.570
THE STATE ALREADY HAS ONGOING

02:01:51.637 --> 02:01:53.272
PROGRAMS IN THESE TWO AREAS A

02:01:53.339 --> 02:01:54.774
SPENDS ABOUT FIFTY MILLION

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:56.642
ANNUALLY ON PROFESSIONAL

02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:57.410
DEVELOPMENT FOR CHILDCARE

02:01:57.476 --> 02:01:58.177
WORKERS.

02:01:58.244 --> 02:01:59.912
AND TRAIN OTHERS FORMS FORMS OF

02:01:59.979 --> 02:02:01.047
TRAINING --

02:02:01.113 --> 02:02:03.149
AND IT HAS A FACILITY REVOLVING

02:02:03.215 --> 02:02:04.550
LOAN FUND.

02:02:04.617 --> 02:02:05.618
SO I THINK WITH THE FIVE HUNDRED

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:07.119
MILLION IS INTENDED TO DO IS TO

02:02:07.186 --> 02:02:08.220
ADDRESS ISSUES THAT CAN BE

02:02:08.287 --> 02:02:09.689
ADJUSTED IS EXISTING ONGOING

02:02:09.755 --> 02:02:10.990
PROGRAMS.

02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:12.024
BUT THERE'S A LOT THE STATE

02:02:12.091 --> 02:02:13.459
DOESN'T KNOW IN IS AREAS THAT

02:02:13.526 --> 02:02:15.261
DOESN'T HAVE BASIC INFORMATION

02:02:15.327 --> 02:02:16.062
LIKE THE NUMBER OF CHILD CARE

02:02:16.128 --> 02:02:17.496
WORKERS THEIR EDUCATIONAL

02:02:17.563 --> 02:02:19.598
ATTAINMENT THEIR CREDENTIALS.

02:02:19.665 --> 02:02:21.033
HOW LONG THEY STAY WHY THEY

02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:23.602
LEAVE? FOR FACILITIES WE DON'T

02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:24.837
KNOW HOW MANY PROVIDERS OWN OR

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:26.639
LEASE OF THOSE THAT LEASE WE

02:02:26.706 --> 02:02:27.406
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ARE

02:02:27.473 --> 02:02:28.741
SUBSIDIZED THROUGH OTHER LOCAL

02:02:28.808 --> 02:02:29.909
GOVERNMENTS.

02:02:29.975 --> 02:02:30.843
WE DON'T KNOW THE GREATEST

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:32.078
FACILITY CHALLENGE US AND WE

02:02:32.144 --> 02:02:33.679
DON'T KNOW IF THOSE CHALLENGES

02:02:33.746 --> 02:02:34.814
VARY ACROSS THE STATE.

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:35.781
SO THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION

02:02:35.848 --> 02:02:37.383
WE THINK THE STATE COULD OLLECT

02:02:37.450 --> 02:02:38.884
BEFORE IT --

02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:41.253
GOES AHEAD AND A PORTIONS THOSE

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:42.655
FIVE MIGHT BE AN AREA WHERE YOU

02:02:42.722 --> 02:02:44.056
WOULD WANT TO SPEND IN THE

02:02:44.123 --> 02:02:44.590
FUTURE YOU COULD SET THOSE

02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:45.491
MONIES ASIDE.

02:02:45.558 --> 02:02:47.593
STUDY THE ISSUES UPON GETTING

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:49.495
THE RESULTS GO AHEAD AND OF

02:02:49.562 --> 02:02:50.096
COURSE IN THE FUNDS IN FUTURE

02:02:50.162 --> 02:02:51.630
YEARS.

02:02:51.697 --> 02:02:52.665
THERE IS A CONVERSATION EARLIER

02:02:52.732 --> 02:02:54.867
ABOUT THE PRESCHOOL PROPOSAL TO

02:02:54.934 --> 02:02:56.302
EXPAND IT TO ALTHOUGH INCOME

02:02:56.368 --> 02:02:57.837
STUDENTS CHILDREN.

02:02:57.903 --> 02:02:59.205
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE

02:02:59.271 --> 02:03:01.540
EXPANSION IS JUST VERY AMBITIOUS

02:03:01.607 --> 02:03:03.275
IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT ADDING

02:03:03.342 --> 02:03:04.944
TIME THOUSAND SLOTS IN A SINGLE

02:03:05.010 --> 02:03:07.546
YEAR IT'S A 40% INCREASE FOR

02:03:07.613 --> 02:03:10.015
THESE PROVIDERS WHO WOULD BE

02:03:10.082 --> 02:03:11.317
TASKED WITH DOING NOT.

02:03:11.383 --> 02:03:12.752
A BIG JOB FOR CD E. JUST TO

02:03:12.818 --> 02:03:14.386
SOLICIT APPLICATIONS REVIEW THEM

02:03:14.453 --> 02:03:16.689
FOR PROVIDERS TO FIND FACILITIES

02:03:16.756 --> 02:03:17.990
AND STAFF.

02:03:18.057 --> 02:03:18.691
SO WE'D RECOMMEND A SLOW

02:03:18.758 --> 02:03:20.559
ARAMBULA MAYBE SOMETHING MORE ON

02:03:20.626 --> 02:03:22.328
THE ORDER OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

02:03:22.394 --> 02:03:23.229
STUDENTS AT CHILDREN.

02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:24.597
I WOULD AGAIN FREE UP SOME MONEY

02:03:24.663 --> 02:03:26.298
IN YOUR BUDGET FOR OTHER THINGS

02:03:26.365 --> 02:03:27.399
THIS YEAR.

02:03:27.466 --> 02:03:28.701
THE GOVERNOR ALSO IS PROPOSING

02:03:28.768 --> 02:03:30.703
TO REMOVE THE WORK REQUIREMENT

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:32.304
FOR THE FULL DAY SLOTS BUT HE

02:03:32.371 --> 02:03:33.739
DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THE FISCAL

02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:36.041
IMPACT BUILT INTO HIS BUDGET.

02:03:36.108 --> 02:03:37.710
SO IF THERE WERE FAMILIES WHO

02:03:37.777 --> 02:03:39.178
ARE NOW USING PARK DAY SLOTS WHO

02:03:39.245 --> 02:03:40.679
ALL WOULD BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR

02:03:40.746 --> 02:03:42.381
FULL DAY THOUGHTS IF ANY OF THEM

02:03:42.448 --> 02:03:44.383
CHOOSE TO ENROLL FULL DAY.

02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:46.085
YOUR PROGRAMS GOING TO COST MUCH

02:03:46.152 --> 02:03:47.686
MORE THAN IS CURRENTLY IN YOUR

02:03:47.753 --> 02:03:49.188
BUDGET SO IF HALF OF THE

02:03:49.255 --> 02:03:50.856
FAMILIES DECIDED TO DO FULL THEY

02:03:50.923 --> 02:03:51.891
WERE IN THE PAST THEY WOULD HAVE

02:03:51.957 --> 02:03:52.725
THEM PART TODAY.

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:54.393
THE PROGRAM'S GOING TO BE THREE

02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:55.427
HUNDRED AND SIXTY SOME MILLION

02:03:55.494 --> 02:03:57.229
DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE OBVIOUSLY

02:03:57.296 --> 02:03:58.564
A FULL DAY SLOTS MUCH MORE

02:03:58.631 --> 02:04:00.232
EXPENSIVE THAN PARTY SLOT MORE

02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:03.169
THAN DOUBLE THE COST.

02:04:03.235 --> 02:04:04.837
WITH THAT TEND.

02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:05.771
TO WITH THAT TEND TO CUT THE

02:04:05.838 --> 02:04:07.306
SLOTS FOR FAMILIES WHO ACTUALLY

02:04:07.373 --> 02:04:08.574
NEED HAVE FULL DAY CARE.

02:04:08.641 --> 02:04:10.176
YES SO IF YOU HAVE ANY

02:04:10.242 --> 02:04:12.611
PROJECTIONS ON ON THE IMPACT.

02:04:12.678 --> 02:04:14.713
I'M SO THERE WOULD BE TWO WAYS

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:16.115
TO APPROACH A IF YOU DID WANT TO

02:04:16.182 --> 02:04:17.449
DO THE POLICY YOU COULD JUST PUT

02:04:17.516 --> 02:04:18.918
THE MONEY BEHIND IT AND MAKE

02:04:18.984 --> 02:04:19.985
SURE YOU DIDN'T SEE THE DROP IN

02:04:20.052 --> 02:04:20.820
FULL DRAIN.

02:04:20.886 --> 02:04:22.121
OTHERWISE YOU WOULD SEE THE DROP

02:04:22.188 --> 02:04:23.622
IN CHILDREN AND THE WAY WE

02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:25.191
UNDERSTAND IT WOULD BECOME

02:04:25.257 --> 02:04:27.493
TRIAGE DOES WE TRIAGE TODAY

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:28.861
WHICH WOULD BECOME INCOME BASED

02:04:28.928 --> 02:04:30.462
SO EVEN IF A FAMILY WAS WORKING

02:04:30.529 --> 02:04:31.897
THEY MIGHT YOU LOSE THEIR SLOT

02:04:31.964 --> 02:04:32.865
JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE SLIGHTLY

02:04:32.932 --> 02:04:34.567
HIGHER INCOME THAN SOMEBODY WHO

02:04:34.633 --> 02:04:36.569
STAYS AT HOME.

02:04:36.635 --> 02:04:38.804
SO GETS TO THE HEART OF YOUR

02:04:38.871 --> 02:04:41.707
FAMILY WHO IS CONTINUING TO WORK --

02:04:41.774 --> 02:04:43.642
OR JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT EVERY

02:04:43.709 --> 02:04:45.311
LOW INCOME CHILD REGARDLESS OF

02:04:45.377 --> 02:04:46.312
WHETHER THEIR PARENTS ARE

02:04:46.378 --> 02:04:47.613
WORKING TO BE ABLE TO AVAIL

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:49.281
THEMSELVES OF A FULL DAY PROGRAM

02:04:49.348 --> 02:04:50.683
BUT YES ONE OF THE IMPLICATIONS

02:04:50.749 --> 02:04:52.084
AS IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE.

02:04:52.151 --> 02:04:53.485
THE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE MONEY YOU

02:04:53.552 --> 02:04:54.954
NEED TO COVER THE COST OF THE

02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:55.955
POLICY THEN FEWER CHILDREN WILL

02:04:56.021 --> 02:04:58.057
BE SERVED HIM VERY LIKELY FEWER

02:04:58.123 --> 02:04:59.425
CHILDREN FROM WORKING FAMILIES

02:04:59.491 --> 02:05:01.060
ARE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE SO I WHAT

02:05:01.126 --> 02:05:02.561
I THINK WITH SOME FOLKS.

02:05:02.628 --> 02:05:03.796
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN FAMILY

02:05:03.863 --> 02:05:07.099
WERE TO WORK ONE NO CAN'T WORK.

02:05:07.166 --> 02:05:08.601
WHICH PUTS THEM INTO A DIFFERENT.

02:05:08.667 --> 02:05:11.270
INCOME CATEGORY IT SORT OF SICK

02:05:11.337 --> 02:05:14.773
SIR CIRCULAR SOMEBODY NEEDS TO

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:17.276
DO SOME ANALYSIS.

02:05:17.343 --> 02:05:18.444
OKAY WE WHAT CAN KERR SO I'M

02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:19.178
TURNING.

02:05:19.245 --> 02:05:19.778
TO NINETY EIGHT IS ONE OF THE

02:05:19.845 --> 02:05:20.880
MOST STREET FOR NINETY EIGHT

02:05:20.946 --> 02:05:22.481
BUDGET SHALL EVER SEE MOST OF

02:05:22.548 --> 02:05:23.983
THE MONEY'S GOING FOR COLA.

02:05:24.049 --> 02:05:25.017
AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

02:05:25.084 --> 02:05:26.619
WHAT MAY MIGHT LOOK LIKE IT

02:05:26.685 --> 02:05:28.087
MIGHT NOT BE ONE OF THESE A FULL

02:05:28.153 --> 02:05:29.688
SURPRISES WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT

02:05:29.755 --> 02:05:31.190
MORE TO WORK WITH AND MADE IT

02:05:31.257 --> 02:05:34.026
COULD BE YOU EVEN HAVE A LITTLE

02:05:34.093 --> 02:05:35.127
BIT LESS TO WORK WITH.

02:05:35.194 --> 02:05:36.262
IF STATE REVENUE COMES IN UNDER

02:05:36.328 --> 02:05:37.897
THE JANUARY PROJECTIONS WHICH IT

02:05:37.963 --> 02:05:39.899
IS TO DATE UNDER PROJECTIONS IN

02:05:39.965 --> 02:05:41.066
THE GUARANTEES GONNA DROP JUST

02:05:41.133 --> 02:05:42.434
THAT'S HOW THE FORMULA WORKS

02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:44.169
IT'LL DROP VERY ROUGHLY FIFTY

02:05:44.236 --> 02:05:45.704
CENTS ON THE DOLLAR.

02:05:45.771 --> 02:05:47.172
SO WE JUST WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU

02:05:47.239 --> 02:05:47.673
TO THINK NOW ABOUT YOUR

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:50.542
PRIORITIES ABOVE GROWTH IN COLAS

02:05:50.609 --> 02:05:52.244
ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES ARE

02:05:52.311 --> 02:05:53.846
SPECIAL ED IN THAT COLLEGE

02:05:53.913 --> 02:05:55.214
PROMISE PROGRAM.

02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:56.849
EVEN IF YOU WERE TO CARE ABOUT

02:05:56.916 --> 02:05:58.183
THOSE AREAS WE THINK THERE ARE

02:05:58.250 --> 02:05:59.485
SOME MORE EFFICIENT WAYS YOU

02:05:59.551 --> 02:06:01.086
COULD GO ABOUT --

02:06:01.153 --> 02:06:02.221
BOTH PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO

02:06:02.288 --> 02:06:04.957
SPECIAL EDUCATION AS WELL AS

02:06:05.024 --> 02:06:05.457
PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO

02:06:05.524 --> 02:06:06.525
FINANCIAL AID.

02:06:06.592 --> 02:06:08.160
WE ALSO SUGGEST THAT YOU JUST

02:06:08.227 --> 02:06:09.295
THINK ABOUT HOW TO POSITION

02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:10.629
SCHOOLS FOR WHAT WE THINK WILL

02:06:10.696 --> 02:06:12.031
BE ON THE HORIZON WHETHER IT'S

02:06:12.097 --> 02:06:13.365
NEXT YEAR OR A FEW YEARS FROM

02:06:13.432 --> 02:06:14.700
NOW RGARDING AN ECONOMIC

02:06:14.767 --> 02:06:15.868
DOWNTURN.

02:06:15.935 --> 02:06:17.636
SO THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE BEFORE

02:06:17.703 --> 02:06:20.205
YOU HAS NO ONE TIME CUSHION OVER

02:06:20.272 --> 02:06:21.373
THE LAST SIX YEARS THE

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:22.975
LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE HAVE

02:06:23.042 --> 02:06:24.476
PUT IN A ONE TIME QUESTION.

02:06:24.543 --> 02:06:26.111
ITS RANGE FROM FOUR HUNDRED

02:06:26.178 --> 02:06:27.346
MILLION TO ONE POINT TWO BILLION

02:06:27.413 --> 02:06:28.614
BUT IT'S ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING

02:06:28.681 --> 02:06:30.149
IT'S AVERAGE SEVEN HUNDRED

02:06:30.215 --> 02:06:32.651
MILLION THERE'S NONE OF THAT AND

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:33.285
THE BUDGET BEFORE YOU.

02:06:33.352 --> 02:06:36.755
WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT

02:06:36.822 --> 02:06:38.023
NOT ONLY IS THERE NOT A QUESTION

02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:39.358
BUT THE GOVERNOR AS ACTUALLY

02:06:39.425 --> 02:06:42.127
USING SOME ONE TIME FUNDING TO

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:43.529
SUPPORT ON GOING PROGRAM.

02:06:43.595 --> 02:06:44.163
SO THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO

02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:45.331
GET TO NEXT YEAR AND THE VERY

02:06:45.397 --> 02:06:47.266
FIRST CALL ON YOUR DOLLARS IS

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:47.866
GOING TO BE TO BACK FILL THIS

02:06:47.933 --> 02:06:48.734
WHOLE.

02:06:48.801 --> 02:06:50.235
STATE SOMETIMES DOES THIS WHEN

02:06:50.302 --> 02:06:51.670
IT'S IN REALLY TIGHT BUDGET

02:06:51.737 --> 02:06:53.005
TIMES WE DON'T ENCOURAGE YOU TO

02:06:53.072 --> 02:06:54.473
DO IT WHEN YOU'RE IN A GOOD

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:56.442
BUDGET SITUATION SO THAT WHOLE

02:06:56.508 --> 02:06:57.910
RIGHT NOW IS SEVENTY SEVEN

02:06:57.977 --> 02:06:59.845
MILLION DOLLARS.

02:06:59.912 --> 02:07:01.080
WE ALSO AS YOU WILL HEAR MORE

02:07:01.146 --> 02:07:02.181
ABOUT OUR YOU'VE HEARD A LITTLE

02:07:02.247 --> 02:07:04.717
BIT ALREADY ON THE PENSIONS THE

02:07:04.783 --> 02:07:06.018
GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING IN THIS

02:07:06.085 --> 02:07:08.020
ENVIRONMENT TO GIVE A GREAT

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:09.722
RELIEF TO DISTRICTS.

02:07:09.788 --> 02:07:10.956
BUT THIS IS A GOOD FISCAL

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:12.324
ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE SENDING

02:07:12.391 --> 02:07:14.793
IS GOING UP THREE POINT 8% SO WE

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:15.894
WOULD SUGGEST THIS ISN'T THE

02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:17.596
RIGHT TIME TO BE OFFERING RIGHT

02:07:17.663 --> 02:07:19.865
RELIEF YOU COULD PUT THAT SEVEN

02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:20.399
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A

02:07:20.466 --> 02:07:21.266
SCIENCE.

02:07:21.333 --> 02:07:22.501
AND GIVE THEM RATE RELIEF WHEN

02:07:22.568 --> 02:07:24.136
THEY'RE PER PEOPLE FINDING AS

02:07:24.203 --> 02:07:26.171
FLAT OR DECLINING THERE BUDGET

02:07:26.238 --> 02:07:28.640
SITUATIONS ARE MUCH TIGHTER THAN

02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:30.342
THEY ARE TODAY.

02:07:30.409 --> 02:07:31.710
WHAT PROP NINETY EIGHT IS

02:07:31.777 --> 02:07:32.511
AMONGST THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD

02:07:32.578 --> 02:07:34.013
BUDGET SHOW EVER SEE THERE'S

02:07:34.079 --> 02:07:35.514
MANY MORE MOVING PIECES TO HIRE

02:07:35.581 --> 02:07:37.016
ADD YOU'VE EXPLORED A LOT OF

02:07:37.082 --> 02:07:38.584
THOSE ALREADY THIS MORNING?

02:07:38.650 --> 02:07:39.685
WE THINK THE BUDGET THE

02:07:39.752 --> 02:07:40.819
GOVERNOR'S BASIC APPROACH IS

02:07:40.886 --> 02:07:42.554
VERY CONSTRUCTIVE AS OPPOSED TO

02:07:42.621 --> 02:07:43.922
THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHO

02:07:43.989 --> 02:07:45.624
GAVE A LOT OF MONEY AND HANDS

02:07:45.691 --> 02:07:46.592
OFF WALKED AWAY.

02:07:46.658 --> 02:07:47.726
THIS GOVERNOR'S TELLING YOU WHAT

02:07:47.793 --> 02:07:49.028
HE CARES ABOUT WE THINK THAT'S

02:07:49.094 --> 02:07:51.764
PRODUCTIVE YOU CAN SEE HOW WELL

02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:52.331
THOSE PARTIES ARE LINED WITH

02:07:52.398 --> 02:07:54.800
YOUR OWN. ONE OF THE LARGEST --

02:07:54.867 --> 02:07:56.435
PARTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:07:56.502 --> 02:07:58.504
IS FOR COMPENSATION.

02:07:58.570 --> 02:08:00.039
HE HAS SUFFICIENT FUNDING AND

02:08:00.105 --> 02:08:02.508
HAS BUDGET ACROSS THE SEGMENTS

02:08:02.574 --> 02:08:03.742
TO PROVIDE TWO AND A HALF TO

02:08:03.809 --> 02:08:04.810
THREE AND A HALF PERCENT SALARY

02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:06.311
INCREASES FOR MOST EMPLOYEE

02:08:06.378 --> 02:08:07.146
GROUPS.

02:08:07.212 --> 02:08:09.281
MOST NINETEEN TWENTY CONTRACTS

02:08:09.348 --> 02:08:10.883
HAVE BEEN FINALIZED AND THEIR

02:08:10.949 --> 02:08:13.185
AGREED UPON NEGOTIATED RATE

02:08:13.252 --> 02:08:14.853
INCREASES ARE IN THAT RANGE.

02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:16.855
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING BUILT

02:08:16.922 --> 02:08:19.091
INTO HIS PROPOSAL FOR YOU SEE

02:08:19.158 --> 02:08:20.692
NON REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES WHICH

02:08:20.759 --> 02:08:22.394
IS ALL THEIR FACULTIES SO ABOUT

02:08:22.461 --> 02:08:24.229
TWO THIRDS OF THEIR CORE FUNDED

02:08:24.296 --> 02:08:25.898
STAFF IS NOT REPRESENTED.

02:08:25.964 --> 02:08:28.067
YOU SEE HOW REQUESTED 3%.

02:08:28.133 --> 02:08:29.401
THE THINKING IS THAT THEY CAN

02:08:29.468 --> 02:08:30.936
FIND SOME OTHER REVENUE STREAMS

02:08:31.003 --> 02:08:32.604
TO COVER THAT COST BUT AGAIN

02:08:32.671 --> 02:08:34.006
IT'S NOT EXPLICITLY IN THE

02:08:34.073 --> 02:08:35.741
BUDGET FOR YOU.

02:08:35.808 --> 02:08:36.975
WE WOULD SUGGEST YOU MIGHT WANT

02:08:37.042 --> 02:08:38.410
TO CONSIDER.

02:08:38.477 --> 02:08:40.813
EXPLORING WITH UC AND CSU THEM

02:08:40.879 --> 02:08:41.080
DOING --

02:08:41.146 --> 02:08:42.881
STAFFING ANALYSIS WE THINK THEY

02:08:42.948 --> 02:08:44.216
SHOULD BE DOING THIS REGULARLY

02:08:44.283 --> 02:08:45.217
AND THEY WOULD LOOK AT

02:08:45.284 --> 02:08:47.252
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION DATA.

02:08:47.319 --> 02:08:48.454
AND THEN AT LEAST FOR NEXT YEAR

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:51.423
YOU CAN HAVE INFORM YOUR

02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:53.258
CONVERSATIONS NEXT YEAR BUT BUT

02:08:53.325 --> 02:08:54.493
NON FACULTY PERSONNEL.

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:56.728
I'M ACTUALLY ACROSS THE BOARD SO

02:08:56.795 --> 02:08:58.197
WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION

02:08:58.263 --> 02:08:59.298
REGULARLY ON FACULTY

02:08:59.364 --> 02:09:01.567
COMPENSATION BUT WE DON'T ON

02:09:01.633 --> 02:09:03.402
RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT WE

02:09:03.469 --> 02:09:04.303
ONLY GET THAT DATA THROUGH

02:09:04.369 --> 02:09:05.671
PERIODIC STUDIES AND WE HAVE

02:09:05.737 --> 02:09:07.473
VERY LITTLE DATA ON NON TENURE

02:09:07.539 --> 02:09:08.774
TRACK OR OTHER.

02:09:08.841 --> 02:09:12.845
FORMS OF UNIVERSITY STAFF.

02:09:12.911 --> 02:09:14.213
I'M ON A ROLL IT TARGETS YOU'VE

02:09:14.279 --> 02:09:15.747
HEARD THAT IT'S A HALF A PERCENT

02:09:15.814 --> 02:09:18.183
FOR THE COLLEGES 2% FOR CSU

02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:20.018
NOTHING FOR YOU SEE AND THERE'S

02:09:20.085 --> 02:09:21.620
NOT A LOT OF GUIDING FACTOR IS

02:09:21.687 --> 02:09:23.489
THAT EXPLAINS THE DIFFERENCE AS

02:09:23.555 --> 02:09:24.857
WE WOULD UGGEST YOU TAKE INTO

02:09:24.923 --> 02:09:26.425
ACCOUNT SOME BASIC FACTORS.

02:09:26.492 --> 02:09:27.626
NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES

02:09:27.693 --> 02:09:29.495
AND HOW THAT'S CHANGING THE

02:09:29.561 --> 02:09:30.996
EXISTING ENROLLMENT LEVELS AND

02:09:31.063 --> 02:09:32.397
HOW WELL A LINE THEY ARE WITH

02:09:32.464 --> 02:09:33.699
THE MASTER PLAN.

02:09:33.765 --> 02:09:34.800
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ARE BEING

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:37.369
REDIRECTED ON THE NUMBER OF

02:09:37.436 --> 02:09:37.936
STUDENTS WHO ARE JUST BEING

02:09:38.003 --> 02:09:38.904
TURNED AWAY.

02:09:38.971 --> 02:09:40.038
THE FIRST TWO FACTORS WOULD

02:09:40.105 --> 02:09:40.973
SUGGEST THAT YOU DON'T NEED A

02:09:41.039 --> 02:09:42.541
HIGHER ENROLLMENT TARGET NEXT

02:09:42.608 --> 02:09:43.742
YEAR IN THE LAST TWO FACTORS

02:09:43.809 --> 02:09:45.310
WOULD SUGGEST SOME GROWTH MIGHT

02:09:45.377 --> 02:09:47.546
BE WARRANTED.

02:09:47.613 --> 02:09:49.448
SO ON THE IMPROVEMENTS

02:09:49.515 --> 02:09:52.217
INITIATIVES WE JUST SUGGEST IF

02:09:52.284 --> 02:09:52.851
YOU DO DECIDE AND THERE'S SOME

02:09:52.918 --> 02:09:53.519
PRETTY.

02:09:53.585 --> 02:09:54.953
TOUGH TRADE OFFS AS TO WHETHER

02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:56.255
YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO PUT

02:09:56.321 --> 02:09:58.323
MONEY AND CITIES THE NATIONAL

02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:59.725
DOES BUT WERE YOU.

02:09:59.791 --> 02:10:00.459
TO ONE TWO WE WE JUST ENCOURAGE

02:10:00.526 --> 02:10:01.326
YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW MEAN

02:10:01.393 --> 02:10:03.128
EXPLICIT EXPECTATIONS THAT THE

02:10:03.195 --> 02:10:04.496
SEGMENTS WOULD CONTINUE TO

02:10:04.563 --> 02:10:06.198
IMPROVE YOU WOULD HAVE

02:10:06.265 --> 02:10:07.299
EXPECTATIONS THAT THEIR

02:10:07.366 --> 02:10:08.567
GRADUATES WOULD IMPROVE THEIR

02:10:08.634 --> 02:10:09.701
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS WOULD NARROW

02:10:09.768 --> 02:10:11.336
THEIR ACCESS UNIT TAKING WOULD

02:10:11.403 --> 02:10:12.404
BE REDUCED.

02:10:12.471 --> 02:10:14.673
THAT WOULD BE A VERY EXPLICIT

02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:16.141
CLEAR EXPECTATION.

02:10:16.208 --> 02:10:18.143
ON THE LIVING A MENTAL HEALTH

02:10:18.210 --> 02:10:20.145
ISSUES THE STATE HAS A LONG

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:21.413
STANDING POLICY OF COVERING

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:23.148
TUITION FOR ALL FINANCIALLY

02:10:23.215 --> 02:10:25.117
NEEDY STUDENTS BUT IT DOESN'T

02:10:25.184 --> 02:10:26.618
HAVE A LARGE SCALE LONG STANDING

02:10:26.685 --> 02:10:28.220
POLICY ON HOW TO COVER LIVING

02:10:28.287 --> 02:10:29.254
COSTS.

02:10:29.321 --> 02:10:29.788
AND YOU HAD A BIT OF THAT

02:10:29.855 --> 02:10:31.657
CONVERSATION THIS MORNING WHAT

02:10:31.723 --> 02:10:32.858
WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT.

02:10:32.925 --> 02:10:34.026
BUT BECAUSE THIS COULD BE A

02:10:34.092 --> 02:10:36.261
MAJOR EW POLICY FOR THE STATE

02:10:36.328 --> 02:10:39.364
WITH MAJOR NEW COST IMPLICATIONS

02:10:39.431 --> 02:10:40.032
RESEARCHERS.

02:10:40.098 --> 02:10:41.466
ARE LEARNING AS MUCH AS THE

02:10:41.533 --> 02:10:44.603
STATE KIND C. SO WE THINK

02:10:44.670 --> 02:10:45.137
THERE'S LOTS THAT COULD BE

02:10:45.204 --> 02:10:46.238
LEARNED.

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:47.573
THE INCIDENTS AN UNDERLYING

02:10:47.639 --> 02:10:49.474
CAUSES OF HOUSING A FEW FOOD AND

02:10:49.541 --> 02:10:51.343
SECURITY WHY IT IS SO HIGH ON

02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:53.545
COLLEGE CAMPUSES MUCH HIGHER

02:10:53.612 --> 02:10:54.813
THAN THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:56.148
AT LARGE.

02:10:56.215 --> 02:10:57.449
OBTAIN RELIABLE COST OF

02:10:57.516 --> 02:10:59.685
ATTENDANCE DATA FOR ALL KINDS OF

02:10:59.751 --> 02:11:00.219
STUDENTS INCLUDING STUDENT

02:11:00.285 --> 02:11:01.353
PARENTS.

02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:02.654
UNDERSTAND THE INTERACTION OF

02:11:02.721 --> 02:11:04.189
FINANCIAL AID WITH ALL THE OTHER

02:11:04.256 --> 02:11:05.591
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

02:11:05.657 --> 02:11:07.092
DESIGNED TO HELP INDIVIDUALS

02:11:07.159 --> 02:11:09.061
WITH FOOD AND HOUSING.

02:11:09.127 --> 02:11:10.262
FIGURE OUT THE TRADE OFFS ARE AT

02:11:10.329 --> 02:11:11.730
LEAST CONTEMPLATE THE TRADE OFFS

02:11:11.797 --> 02:11:13.732
BETWEEN PRETTY MORE MONEY AND TO

02:11:13.799 --> 02:11:15.267
COLLEGE STUDENTS AND MORE MONEY

02:11:15.334 --> 02:11:16.735
AND TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES THAT

02:11:16.802 --> 02:11:17.669
LARGE.

02:11:17.736 --> 02:11:19.004
AND HAVE A MUCH BETTER SENSE OF

02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:20.539
WHAT IS THE UNMET NEED AND WHAT

02:11:20.606 --> 02:11:21.573
ARE YOUR OPTIONS FOR COVERING

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:22.741
THEM I THINK YOU COULD GO

02:11:22.808 --> 02:11:23.809
THROUGH THE SAME ISSUES WITH

02:11:23.875 --> 02:11:25.410
MENTAL HEALTH THERE'S JUST A LOT

02:11:25.477 --> 02:11:26.945
THAT THE STATE DOESN'T KNOW YET.

02:11:27.012 --> 02:11:28.013
AND I THINK BEFORE THE STATE

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:29.715
WOULD CREATE A PROGRAM JUST FOR

02:11:29.781 --> 02:11:31.416
YOU SEE STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE IN

02:11:31.483 --> 02:11:32.618
MY ONE A STEP BACK AND LEARN A

02:11:32.684 --> 02:11:34.553
LOT MORE ABOUT THE ISSUE ACROSS

02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:36.321
THE STATE.

02:11:36.388 --> 02:11:37.756
I'M TUITION PREDICTABILITY THERE

02:11:37.823 --> 02:11:39.291
SEEMS TO BE BROAD CONSENSUS THIS

02:11:39.358 --> 02:11:40.792
WOULD BE A GOOD THING IF SOMEHOW

02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:42.661
THE STATE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW

02:11:42.728 --> 02:11:44.162
TO HAVE MORE PREDICTABLE TUITION

02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:45.897
NOT HIKES DURING.

02:11:45.964 --> 02:11:47.766
RECESSIONS AND THEN FLAT FOR

02:11:47.833 --> 02:11:50.369
LONG PERIODS OF TIME ELSEWHERE.

02:11:50.435 --> 02:11:51.770
WE THINK THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS

02:11:51.837 --> 02:11:52.904
IS MORE RESERVE.

02:11:52.971 --> 02:11:54.539
SO THE WAY IS HOW HOW DO YOU

02:11:54.606 --> 02:11:55.207
FIGURE OUT HOW TO BUILD UP YOUR

02:11:55.274 --> 02:11:56.241
RESEARCH.

02:11:56.308 --> 02:11:58.243
AND ONE WAY IS TO AT LEAST

02:11:58.310 --> 02:12:00.312
CONSIDER I'M TAKING THESE COST

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:01.680
INCREASES BEFORE YOU WHETHER

02:12:01.747 --> 02:12:03.682
THEY BE FOR FACULTY OR FOR

02:12:03.749 --> 02:12:05.250
STUDENTS SUPPORT --

02:12:05.317 --> 02:12:07.085
AND HAVING NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY

02:12:07.152 --> 02:12:09.321
STUDENTS ARE SOME OF THAT COST

02:12:09.388 --> 02:12:11.423
SO IF ALL COSTS ARE GOING UP 3%

02:12:11.490 --> 02:12:12.457
BOTH THE STATE AND NON

02:12:12.524 --> 02:12:13.625
FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS THE

02:12:13.692 --> 02:12:15.494
ONES THAT ARE PAYING THE TUITION

02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:16.361
AND NOT ALL THE CAL GRANT

02:12:16.428 --> 02:12:18.030
STUDENTS.

02:12:18.096 --> 02:12:19.031
I WHICH SHARON THOSE COSTS.

02:12:19.097 --> 02:12:20.399
RIGHT NOW NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY

02:12:20.465 --> 02:12:23.168
STUDENTS AT CS YOU PAY 23% OF

02:12:23.235 --> 02:12:25.704
THEIR EDUCATION COSTA NOTCSU

02:12:25.771 --> 02:12:28.307
I'M SORRY AT UC 13%.

02:12:28.373 --> 02:12:29.841
IT'S LOWER AT YOU SEE BECAUSE OF

02:12:29.908 --> 02:12:31.610
ALL THEIR NON RESIDENT TUITION

02:12:31.677 --> 02:12:33.412
AND THEY CAN USE THAT TO CROSS

02:12:33.478 --> 02:12:34.746
SUBSIDIZE THEIR RESIDENTS.

02:12:34.813 --> 02:12:35.947
BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE NON NEEDY

02:12:36.014 --> 02:12:37.549
STUDENTS ARE PAYING TODAY SO THE

02:12:37.616 --> 02:12:38.550
QUESTION BEFORE YOU IS WHETHER

02:12:38.617 --> 02:12:40.452
YOU WANT TO JUST KEEP THEM WHERE

02:12:40.519 --> 02:12:41.219
THEY'RE ADDED --

02:12:41.286 --> 02:12:42.587
THEY'RE DROPPING THEIR SURE HAS

02:12:42.654 --> 02:12:44.356
CONSISTENTLY BEEN DROPPING OVER

02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:46.591
THE SIX YEARS WERE FEES HAVE

02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:47.426
BEEN FLAT.

02:12:47.492 --> 02:12:48.160
IF YOU HAD A POLICY WHERE AS

02:12:48.226 --> 02:12:49.494
RESERVES ARE THE BEST WAY TO

02:12:49.561 --> 02:12:51.530
SIGNAL YOUR INTENTION TO KEEP

02:12:51.596 --> 02:12:53.231
TUITION PREDICTABLE OVER TIME A

02:12:53.298 --> 02:12:54.700
SHERIFF COST POLICY THAT WOULD

02:12:54.766 --> 02:12:55.334
SAY.

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:56.268
A NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY FOR

02:12:56.335 --> 02:12:59.171
STUDENT THERE RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:12:59.237 --> 02:13:02.074
WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE 102040% OF

02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:03.008
COST.

02:13:03.075 --> 02:13:04.076
IT WOULD HELP THEM KNOW WHETHER

02:13:04.142 --> 02:13:05.444
THEY ENTER COLLEGE DURING A

02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:07.479
RECESSION OR DURING A RECOVERY

02:13:07.546 --> 02:13:09.114
THAT WOULD BE THE COST THEY

02:13:09.181 --> 02:13:11.516
WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BEAR.

02:13:11.583 --> 02:13:14.086
THE FINAL PAGES ON CAP OUT LATE --

02:13:14.152 --> 02:13:16.054
WE AS YOU'VE HEARD A LOT A LOT

02:13:16.121 --> 02:13:17.823
ABOUT SUGGEST THAT YOU EVEN

02:13:17.889 --> 02:13:20.892
ACCELERATE MORE PROP FIFTY ONE

02:13:20.959 --> 02:13:21.126
BOND --

02:13:21.193 --> 02:13:22.194
PAYMENTS.

02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:23.595
THE GOVERNOR HAS MUCH MORE THAN

02:13:23.662 --> 02:13:24.796
THE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR DEAD

02:13:24.863 --> 02:13:27.265
TRIPLE THE AMOUNT FOR K. TWELVE

02:13:27.332 --> 02:13:28.967
THE BACKLOG IS SUBSTANTIAL WE

02:13:29.034 --> 02:13:30.335
SUGGEST YOU GO AHEAD AND DO THE

02:13:30.402 --> 02:13:31.903
ONE AND A HALFBILLION OR

02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:33.438
SOMETHING OF THAT MAGNITUDE.

02:13:33.505 --> 02:13:35.040
WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE THINK

02:13:35.107 --> 02:13:36.708
YOU COULD SUPPORT MORE PROJECTS

02:13:36.775 --> 02:13:38.076
EVEN WITH THE GOVERNOR HE IS

02:13:38.143 --> 02:13:39.611
PROPOSING MORE PROJECTS THAN IN

02:13:39.678 --> 02:13:42.147
THE PAST ALMOST MORE THAN DOUBLE

02:13:42.214 --> 02:13:43.415
THE PROJECTS THAT WERE APPROVED

02:13:43.482 --> 02:13:45.183
EACH AT PROPOSED EACH OF THE

02:13:45.250 --> 02:13:46.451
LAST TWO YEARS.

02:13:46.518 --> 02:13:47.819
BUT HE'S STILL ON ABOUT A NINE

02:13:47.886 --> 02:13:49.821
YEAR TRACK TO SPEND ALL THE PROP

02:13:49.888 --> 02:13:51.723
FIFTY ONE DOLLAR SO YOU MIGHT

02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:52.324
WANT TO THINK ABOUT EXPEDITING

02:13:52.391 --> 02:13:53.458
NOT.

02:13:53.525 --> 02:13:54.659
WE ALSO WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE

02:13:54.726 --> 02:13:55.894
ADMINISTRATION THE CHANCELLOR'S

02:13:55.961 --> 02:13:57.729
OFFICE GET ON THE SAME PAGE AS

02:13:57.796 --> 02:13:59.197
TO THE STANDARDS THEY USE TO

02:13:59.264 --> 02:14:00.866
EVALUATE THESE PROJECTS YOU

02:14:00.932 --> 02:14:01.633
HEARD ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:02.467
EARLIER.

02:14:02.534 --> 02:14:04.202
IT DOES CREATE SOME FRUSTRATION

02:14:04.269 --> 02:14:05.303
IN THE FIELD THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:06.638
QUITE SURE WHAT IT TAKES TO PUT

02:14:06.705 --> 02:14:09.708
TOGETHER A GOOD FACILITY PROJECT.

02:14:09.775 --> 02:14:11.109
WHERE ENCOURAGE THAT THAT FOR

02:14:11.176 --> 02:14:12.177
THE UNIVERSITY IS THE

02:14:12.244 --> 02:14:13.678
ADMINISTRATION IS GOING PROJECT

02:14:13.745 --> 02:14:15.480
BY PROJECT AND SEEN IF THERE'S

02:14:15.547 --> 02:14:16.815
JUSTIFICATION FOR IT?

02:14:16.882 --> 02:14:18.283
NORMALLY THAT MEANS THAT WE LOOK

02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:20.619
AT THE FACILITY UTILIZATION AND

02:14:20.685 --> 02:14:23.054
SEE IF IT'S AT OR REACHED FOR IN

02:14:23.121 --> 02:14:24.723
EXCESS OF EXISTING CAPACITY.

02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:26.158
AND IS LOOKING AT COSTSTO MAKE

02:14:26.224 --> 02:14:27.459
SURE THEY'RE REASONABLE WE THINK

02:14:27.526 --> 02:14:28.260
THERE ARE STILL SOME

02:14:28.326 --> 02:14:31.196
OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO REFINE

02:14:31.263 --> 02:14:33.432
SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS --

02:14:33.498 --> 02:14:35.000
AS YOU GO THROUGH THE SEASON

02:14:35.066 --> 02:14:36.435
UNDER FOR MAINTENANCE AGAIN MANY

02:14:36.501 --> 02:14:37.502
PEOPLE THINK IT'S A GOOD YOU

02:14:37.569 --> 02:14:39.037
SOMEONE TIME FUNDS IT PREVENTS

02:14:39.104 --> 02:14:40.739
COSTLIER REPAIRS FROM BEING

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:42.073
NEEDED DOWN THE ROAD.

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS.

02:15:25.917 --> 02:15:27.285

HUNDRED SOME MILLION NOT HE'S

02:15:41.166 --> 02:15:42.734
PROPOSE.

FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND WITH

02:15:43.368 --> 02:15:44.703
REGARD TO THE WE HAD THE BOND

02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:47.172
CONVERSATION EARLIER POTENTIAL

02:15:47.239 --> 02:15:48.507
BOND CONVERSATION ABOUT.

02:15:48.573 --> 02:15:50.175
REVOLVING AROUND DEFERRED

02:15:50.242 --> 02:15:51.676
MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL NEEDS IT

02:15:51.743 --> 02:15:53.845
BOTH THE UC IN THE C. ISSUE --

02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:55.547
CAMPUSES.

02:15:55.614 --> 02:15:58.817
REFRESH MY RECOLLECTION ABOUT

02:15:58.884 --> 02:15:59.851
TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AYE I WAS

02:15:59.918 --> 02:16:01.486
HERE I SEEM TO REMEMBER.

02:16:01.553 --> 02:16:03.788
WHAT I THINK I RECALL IS THAT

02:16:03.855 --> 02:16:04.823
THE -- OF

02:16:04.890 --> 02:16:06.858
THE OF THE BOND OBLIGATION WAS

02:16:06.925 --> 02:16:09.227
TRANSFERRED FROM THE STATE.

02:16:09.294 --> 02:16:11.463
TO IN THE CASE OF YOU SEE TO YOU

02:16:11.530 --> 02:16:12.964
SEE THAT WHAT HAPPENED.

02:16:13.031 --> 02:16:14.299
YEAH OUT WHERE WE WERE A LITTLE

02:16:14.366 --> 02:16:15.634
BIT NERVOUS ABOUT THIS AT THE

02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:17.369
TIME BECAUSE IT REPRESENTED SUCH

02:16:17.435 --> 02:16:19.070
AS SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM

02:16:19.137 --> 02:16:21.072
STATE PRACTICE HISTORICALLY.

02:16:21.139 --> 02:16:25.310
BUT YES AND TWENTY THIRTEEN

02:16:25.377 --> 02:16:25.844
FORTY THAT IT WANTED A NEW

02:16:25.911 --> 02:16:27.345
PARADIGM WHERE RATHER THAN

02:16:27.412 --> 02:16:28.613
THINKING ABOUT CAP OUT LAY AND

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:30.849
SUPPORT AS TWO SEPARATE ENTITIES

02:16:30.916 --> 02:16:32.751
SEPARATE PARTS OF THE BUDGET WE

02:16:32.817 --> 02:16:34.185
WOULD PULL THEM TOGETHER INTO

02:16:34.252 --> 02:16:35.921
ONE ITEM AND EVERY YEAR IT MAKE

02:16:35.987 --> 02:16:37.422
IT EASIER FOR YOU AND THE

02:16:37.489 --> 02:16:38.557
SEGMENTS. TO WEIGH THE TRADE

02:16:38.623 --> 02:16:40.525
OFFS BETWEEN MORE MONEY FOR

02:16:40.592 --> 02:16:41.059
CAPITAL AND MORE MONEY FOR

02:16:41.126 --> 02:16:41.860
SUPPORT.

02:16:41.927 --> 02:16:43.562
SO AS PART OF THAT NEW PARADIGM

02:16:43.628 --> 02:16:45.130
AND THE SHIFT TO IT THE STATE

02:16:45.196 --> 02:16:46.898
CALCULATED IT NEW EFFECTIVELY

02:16:46.965 --> 02:16:48.934
WHAT IT WAS PAYING FOR YOU SEE

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.169
GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS AT THAT

02:16:51.236 --> 02:16:52.304
PERIOD OF TIME.

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:54.005
IT WAS --

02:16:54.072 --> 02:16:54.639
TWO HUNDRED SOME MILLION DOLLARS

02:16:54.706 --> 02:16:56.775
AS I RECALL IT JUST SHIFTED INTO

02:16:56.841 --> 02:16:58.777
THE MAIN ITEMS THAT WE NO LONGER

02:16:58.843 --> 02:17:00.178
HAD A CAPITAL ITEM IN A SUPPORT

02:17:00.245 --> 02:17:03.048
ITEM WE JUST HAD ONE MAIN ITEM.

02:17:03.114 --> 02:17:04.049
AND SAID WELL YOU SEE YOU GO

02:17:04.115 --> 02:17:06.251
FORTH AND MANAGER FACILITIES SO

02:17:06.318 --> 02:17:08.286
SINCE THAT TIME YOU SEE HAS GONE

02:17:08.353 --> 02:17:09.788
TO THE MARKET THROUGH UNIVERSITY

02:17:09.854 --> 02:17:12.257
BONDS AND FINANCE THEIR PROJECTS.

02:17:12.324 --> 02:17:14.192
AND THEY STILL HAVE THAT TWO

02:17:14.259 --> 02:17:15.160
HUNDRED SOME MILLION SO THEY

02:17:15.226 --> 02:17:17.462
STILL ARE CARRYING SOME STATE

02:17:17.529 --> 02:17:19.064
GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND AT OF

02:17:19.130 --> 02:17:20.832
THOSE THIRTY YEAR SOME PROJECTS

02:17:20.899 --> 02:17:22.634
OF NOT RETIRED AT THIS POINT SO

02:17:22.701 --> 02:17:24.235
THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE MAKE SURE

02:17:24.302 --> 02:17:25.503
WE ARE AS A STATE AND THEY AS A

02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:26.805
STATEMENT MAKE SURE.

02:17:26.871 --> 02:17:28.406
THAT THOSE PAYMENTS ARE HONORED

02:17:28.473 --> 02:17:29.507
SO I GUESS THE POINT OF THE

02:17:29.574 --> 02:17:30.976
CONVERSATION IN THE POINT TO

02:17:31.042 --> 02:17:32.210
LOOKING BACK TO A GENERAL

02:17:32.277 --> 02:17:33.612
OBLIGATION BOND.

02:17:33.678 --> 02:17:37.449
IS THEY MUST BE OUT OF BONDING.

02:17:37.515 --> 02:17:38.783
OR DO WE HAVE INSUFFICIENT

02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:40.218
BINDING CAPACITY.

02:17:40.285 --> 02:17:41.453
TO TAKE CARE OF THE DEFERRED

02:17:41.519 --> 02:17:42.621
MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL NEEDS OF

02:17:42.687 --> 02:17:44.356
THE UC CAMPUSES.

02:17:44.422 --> 02:17:45.824
YEAH I THINK THOSE WOULD BE THE

02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:47.425
KINDS OF ISSUES YOU WOULD WANNA

02:17:47.492 --> 02:17:49.227
START CONTEMPLATING AGAIN ALSO

02:17:49.294 --> 02:17:50.962
AS A REMINDER AS PART OF THE NEW

02:17:51.029 --> 02:17:51.663
PARADIGM.

02:17:51.730 --> 02:17:54.299
THE STATE PUTTING CAPS AS AN

02:17:54.366 --> 02:17:55.600
EFFORT TO SAY OKAY WE'RE GONNA

02:17:55.667 --> 02:17:58.670
DELEGATE TO YOU UC AND CSU HOW

02:17:58.737 --> 02:17:59.904
TO MANAGE YOUR FACILITIES ENTER

02:17:59.971 --> 02:18:02.140
OPERATIONS BUT WE DON'T WANT YOU

02:18:02.207 --> 02:18:04.275
SPENDING MORE THAN 15% OF YOUR

02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:06.277
BUDGET ANNUALLY ON THAT ON

02:18:06.344 --> 02:18:07.445
CAPITOL THAT.

02:18:07.512 --> 02:18:09.814
SO IT DID CREATE SOME MORE

02:18:09.881 --> 02:18:11.249
FLEXIBILITY BUT WITH THIS OLD

02:18:11.316 --> 02:18:13.718
CEMENT EXPECTATION THAT THEY NOT

02:18:13.785 --> 02:18:15.220
SPEND MORE THAN YOU WANTED ON

02:18:15.286 --> 02:18:16.755
THE CAPITAL SIDE SERVER GOES TO

02:18:16.821 --> 02:18:19.658
THE MARKET WE PUT A LIMIT ON ON

02:18:19.724 --> 02:18:20.892
THE FUNDING YOU EAT EXACTLY.

02:18:20.959 --> 02:18:22.160
SEE ISSUE DO WE DO THE SAME

02:18:22.227 --> 02:18:24.462
THING TO THE CSU CAMPUS YEAR

02:18:24.529 --> 02:18:25.463
LIKE YOU JUST SAID A YEAR LATER

02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:26.698
THEY HAVE THE SAME THE ISSUE IS

02:18:26.765 --> 02:18:31.870
THE SAME ISSUES PRESUMABLY YOU

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:32.370
SEE DOES IN THAT REGARD.

02:18:32.437 --> 02:18:33.104
AFTER [inaudible]

02:18:33.171 --> 02:18:36.141
OKAY BUT ELEVEN QUESTIONS.

02:18:36.207 --> 02:18:37.042
I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THE PRE

02:18:37.108 --> 02:18:38.076
SCHOOL EXPANSION.

02:18:38.143 --> 02:18:39.744
SO YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT VERY

02:18:39.811 --> 02:18:41.579
EXCITED ABOUT THE TEN THOUSAND

02:18:41.646 --> 02:18:43.014
MORE SLOTS BUT THAT'S A LITTLE

02:18:43.081 --> 02:18:44.382
SCARY WHEN YOU'RE THINKING THAT

02:18:44.449 --> 02:18:46.751
LOGISTICALLY WE JUST COULDN'T DO

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:48.620
THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK.

02:18:48.687 --> 02:18:50.622
YEAH SO WE HAVE SOME I'M HIS

02:18:50.689 --> 02:18:52.357
HISTORY WE CAN RELY UPON SO A

02:18:52.424 --> 02:18:53.858
FEW YEARS AGO THE STATE GAVE

02:18:53.925 --> 02:18:55.660
THESE NON ALLEY A PROVIDERS THE

02:18:55.727 --> 02:18:57.295
ONES THAT ISSUE THOUSAND NEW

02:18:57.362 --> 02:18:58.596
SLOTS AND THEY WERE ABLE TO USE

02:18:58.663 --> 02:18:59.864
THEM OKAY --

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:02.300
BUT TEN THOUSAND SPOTS IS THIS

02:19:02.367 --> 02:19:03.902
40% INCREASE AND SO WE THOUGHT

02:19:03.968 --> 02:19:06.171
WELL YOU IDEALLY WANT THE SLOTS

02:19:06.237 --> 02:19:07.005
TO BE YOU IS YOU'RE GOING TO BE

PUTTING MONEY BEHIND THEM SO WE

02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.308
THINK.

02:19:10.375 --> 02:19:11.276
TWENTY FIVE A HUNDRED NEW SLOTS

02:19:11.342 --> 02:19:12.610
IS JUST A BIT OF A MORE

02:19:12.677 --> 02:19:14.245
PRACTICAL --

02:19:14.312 --> 02:19:16.314
NUMBER.

02:19:16.381 --> 02:19:17.382
THE STATE HAS BEEN SO.

02:19:17.449 --> 02:19:22.487

FOUGHT SHE WANTED SO THAT'S THE

02:19:30.361 --> 02:19:31.129
RISK YOU FACE.

02:40:33.690 --> 02:40:34.891
DATA.

02:40:34.958 --> 02:40:35.359
THOUGH I A MINUTE --

02:40:35.425 --> 02:40:36.360
SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE

02:40:36.426 --> 02:40:37.260
HAVE TO DO FOR FEDERAL

02:40:37.327 --> 02:40:38.962
REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE OF THAT

02:40:39.029 --> 02:40:40.530
CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDS

02:40:40.597 --> 02:40:41.865
WE COLLECT DATA MAINLY AROUND

02:40:41.932 --> 02:40:43.734
DEMOGRAPHICS AND AROUND FAN

02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:46.737
FAMILY ELIGIBILITY AND NEED. TO

02:40:46.803 --> 02:40:47.537
REALLY AROUND THE PROGRAMMER

02:40:47.604 --> 02:40:49.673
CREDIT REQUIREMENTS WE USE THE

02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:51.074
DATA FOR MONITORING PROGRAM

02:40:51.141 --> 02:40:52.609
INTEGRITY AND TO ENSURE

02:40:52.676 --> 02:40:54.644
STEWARDSHIP OF PUBLIC FUNDS.

02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:56.546
THE ONCE AGAIN A LOT BACK TO

02:40:56.613 --> 02:40:57.948
THAT FAMILY ELIGIBILITY AND NEED

02:40:58.015 --> 02:40:59.916
COMPONENTS BUT ALSO FOR TRAINING

02:40:59.983 --> 02:41:01.485
AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

02:41:01.551 --> 02:41:03.053
CONTINUE IN PROVE MEANT. TO

02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:04.621
ENSURE THERE'S BETTER SERVICES

02:41:04.688 --> 02:41:05.689
TO ADDRESS AN ACCORDION

02:41:05.756 --> 02:41:07.357
RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE AS WE

02:41:07.424 --> 02:41:08.558
LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN

02:41:08.625 --> 02:41:10.360
AND FAMILIES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE

02:41:10.427 --> 02:41:12.162
VERSUS THE PERCENTAGE SERVED IN

02:41:12.229 --> 02:41:13.897
EACH OF THE COMMUNITIES.

02:41:13.964 --> 02:41:15.165
BUT REALLY I'M HERE TODAY TO SAY

02:41:15.232 --> 02:41:16.566
THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND

02:41:16.633 --> 02:41:18.769
RESTRICTIONS IN THE DATA AND THE

02:41:18.835 --> 02:41:20.737
USE OF THE DATA DUE TO A LACK OF

02:41:20.804 --> 02:41:22.873
A UNIFIED SYSTEM AND DUE TO LACK

02:41:22.939 --> 02:41:24.107
OF UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.

02:41:24.174 --> 02:41:27.544
SO WE CAN'T ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE

02:41:27.611 --> 02:41:30.714
CHILDREN FOLLOW THEM THROUGH OUR

02:41:30.781 --> 02:41:32.115
PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY TEND TO GO

02:41:32.182 --> 02:41:33.517
IN AND OUT SO I CAN'T TELL YOU

02:41:33.583 --> 02:41:35.318
OF THAT SCENE CHILD.

02:41:35.385 --> 02:41:37.254
HAS LEFT AND THEN RETURNED AND

02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:39.122
WE ALSO CAN GIVE YOU AN ON

02:41:39.189 --> 02:41:40.590
DUPLICATED COUNT ON THE CHILDREN

02:41:40.657 --> 02:41:41.591
AND WE CAN'T TELL YOU IF THEY'RE

02:41:41.658 --> 02:41:43.894
ALSO RECEIVING HEAD START EARLY

02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:44.394
HEAD START.

02:41:44.461 --> 02:41:47.397
THE LOTS OF GAPS IN THE DATA DUE

02:41:47.464 --> 02:41:48.665
TO THE LACK OF AN INTEGRATED

02:41:48.732 --> 02:41:49.433
SYSTEM AND DUE TO THE LACK OF

02:41:49.499 --> 02:41:50.834
THOSE.

02:41:50.901 --> 02:41:52.469
AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.

02:41:52.536 --> 02:41:53.537
WE KNOW WE NEED THE ADDITIONAL

02:41:53.603 --> 02:41:56.006
INFORMATION. TO ENSURE THAT WERE

02:41:56.073 --> 02:41:57.974
MOVING JUST FROM MONITORING TO

02:41:58.041 --> 02:41:59.476
ACTUALLY A SYSTEM THAT'S FOCUSED

02:41:59.543 --> 02:42:00.644
ON IMPROVEMENT.

02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:02.813
I TRULY DRIVEN DATA SYSTEM WE

02:42:02.879 --> 02:42:03.780
KNOW WE NEED TO MOVE FROM A

02:42:03.847 --> 02:42:05.415
FRAGMENTED DATA SYSTEM TO ONE

02:42:05.482 --> 02:42:06.616
THAT'S TRULY COORDINATED.

02:42:06.683 --> 02:42:08.685
AND FROM A SNAPSHOT JUST AT ONE

02:42:08.752 --> 02:42:10.353
POINT IN TIME TO LONGITUDINAL SO

02:42:10.420 --> 02:42:13.023
WE CAN SAY WHEN A BABY ENTERS

02:42:13.090 --> 02:42:14.024
AND THEN AS THEY GO THROUGH THE

02:42:14.091 --> 02:42:15.392
SYSTEM THROUGH PRESCHOOL AND

02:42:15.459 --> 02:42:16.693
THEN ON UP TO KINDERGARTEN

02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:18.028
THROUGH THIRD GRADE.

02:42:18.095 --> 02:42:19.529
SO WE COULD ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A

02:42:19.596 --> 02:42:20.530
LITTLE BIT MORE.

02:42:20.597 --> 02:42:22.566
MEAN REALIZE THAT POLICY MAKERS

02:42:22.632 --> 02:42:24.768
NEED MORE DATA TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:42:24.835 --> 02:42:27.037
PATTERNS IN SERVICE TO LOOK AT

02:42:27.104 --> 02:42:29.072
RESOURCE ALLOCATION. TO ASSESS

02:42:29.139 --> 02:42:30.974
THE IMPACT AND TO DEFINE THE

02:42:31.041 --> 02:42:32.509
COSTS OF PROVIDING THE QUALITY

02:42:32.576 --> 02:42:34.044
OF THOSE SERVICES ACROSS THE

02:42:34.111 --> 02:42:34.744
STATE.

02:42:34.811 --> 02:42:35.879
THOSE ARE THE SAME INFORMATION

02:42:35.946 --> 02:42:37.247
THAT RESEARCHERS ARE ALWAYS

02:42:37.314 --> 02:42:39.583
ASKING US FOR WE GET CONSTANT

02:42:39.649 --> 02:42:39.916
DATA REQUEST.

02:42:39.983 --> 02:42:41.485
I'M ESPECIALLY IF WE WANT TO

02:42:41.551 --> 02:42:43.086
LOOK AT CHILD OUTCOMES AND

02:42:43.153 --> 02:42:44.621
REALLY ADDRESS SOME POLICY

02:42:44.688 --> 02:42:47.491
IMPACTS AROUND THOSE INVESTMENT.

02:42:47.557 --> 02:42:49.226
PARENTS ALSO DEEPLY NEED MORE

02:42:49.292 --> 02:42:50.760
INFORMATION THEY NEED NOT TO

02:42:50.827 --> 02:42:52.629
JUST UNDERSTAND AVAILABILITY BUT

02:42:52.696 --> 02:42:53.830
THEY NEED GREATER INFORMATION

02:42:53.897 --> 02:42:55.432
AROUND IMPACT TO MAKE INFORMED

02:42:55.499 --> 02:42:56.333
CHOICES.

02:42:56.399 --> 02:42:57.634
ABOUT THE EARLY LEARNING AND

02:42:57.701 --> 02:42:59.636
CARE THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THEIR

02:42:59.703 --> 02:43:03.473
COMMUNITIES. TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE

02:43:03.540 --> 02:43:06.042
ACTUALLY NEED A DATA GOVERNOR IN

02:43:06.109 --> 02:43:07.644
THE INTEGRATION FOR BUSINESS

02:43:07.711 --> 02:43:08.979
NEEDS.

02:43:09.045 --> 02:43:10.413
AND FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL

02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:12.115
WE TRULY DEEPLY NO WE NEED

02:43:12.182 --> 02:43:13.917
UNIQUE IDEAS FOR EACH FAMILY

02:43:13.984 --> 02:43:15.752
PROVIDER AND FACILITY THAT

02:43:15.819 --> 02:43:17.654
RECEIVES OUR FUNDS. TO COMPLY

02:43:17.721 --> 02:43:19.422
WITH FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION FOR

02:43:19.489 --> 02:43:20.924
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES REPORTING

02:43:20.991 --> 02:43:22.159
REQUIREMENTS.

02:43:22.225 --> 02:43:23.827
CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S ONLY ONE

02:43:23.894 --> 02:43:25.762
OF THREE STATES THAT DOES NOT

02:43:25.829 --> 02:43:27.497
SEND THE FULL POPULATION DATA

02:43:27.564 --> 02:43:29.366
WITH THOSE UNIQUE ES DE ID'S

02:43:29.432 --> 02:43:31.168
BACK TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR

02:43:31.234 --> 02:43:32.602
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES.

02:43:32.669 --> 02:43:34.271
THE CITY IS TAKING STEPS RIGHT

02:43:34.337 --> 02:43:36.339
NOW AND USING THE FEDERAL

02:43:36.406 --> 02:43:38.141
PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT TO

02:43:38.208 --> 02:43:40.343
CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE EARLY

02:43:40.410 --> 02:43:40.844
LEARNING AND CARE NEEDS

02:43:40.911 --> 02:43:41.878
ASSESSMENT.

02:43:41.945 --> 02:43:43.380
WE'RE DOING THIS IN PARTNERSHIP

02:43:43.446 --> 02:43:45.081
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND

02:43:45.148 --> 02:43:46.650
WORKING WITH THE STATE ADVISORY

02:43:46.716 --> 02:43:47.984
COUNCIL ON EARLY LEARNING AND

02:43:48.051 --> 02:43:48.985
CARE.

02:43:49.052 --> 02:43:50.053
THROUGH THAT WILL BE ABLE TO

02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:51.855
LOOK AT AN ANALYSIS OF OUR DATA

02:43:51.922 --> 02:43:53.490
AND NINETY CAPS WERE IN THE

02:43:53.557 --> 02:43:55.525
BEGINNING STAGES OF IDENTIFYING

02:43:55.592 --> 02:43:57.060
AND ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS FOR

02:43:57.127 --> 02:43:58.361
THE CREATION OF AN EARLY

02:43:58.428 --> 02:43:59.296
CHILDHOOD.

02:43:59.362 --> 02:44:01.298
INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEM THAT THEN

02:44:01.364 --> 02:44:03.700
CONNECT BEYOND THAT SIDE OF

02:44:03.767 --> 02:44:05.602
EARLY LEARNING CARE DATA.

02:44:05.669 --> 02:44:06.937
INDICATE TWELFTH MY PARTNER NEXT

02:44:07.003 --> 02:44:08.638
TO ME THAT WE REALLY CAN FOLLOW

02:44:08.705 --> 02:44:10.674
CHILDREN AND WHAT WE'RE MISSING

02:44:10.740 --> 02:44:12.242
IS THAT ENTITY DEDICATED TO

02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:13.577
COLLECTING INTEGRATING AND

02:44:13.643 --> 02:44:14.978
REPORTING THAT DATA AND A WAY

02:44:15.045 --> 02:44:16.880
THAT'S USEFUL FOR YOU.

02:44:16.947 --> 02:44:19.216
ALSO USEFUL FOR RESEARCHERS AND

02:44:19.282 --> 02:44:23.653
TRULY USEFUL FOR PARENTS THAT

02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:26.423
CONCLUDES MY AND YOU MAKE MA'AM

02:44:26.489 --> 02:44:27.557
YOU KNOW MAY NOT BE THE ONE THAT

02:44:27.624 --> 02:44:29.426
I SHOULD DIRECT THIS TO BUT I'M

02:44:29.492 --> 02:44:29.926
TRYING TO GET AN IDEA.

02:44:29.993 --> 02:44:31.027
IN A PERFECT WORLD IF WE WERE

02:44:31.094 --> 02:44:33.363
ABLE TO CREATE A STATEWIDE

02:44:33.430 --> 02:44:34.998
LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM.

02:44:35.065 --> 02:44:37.234
THAT CENTRALIZED AND NOT WITH

02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:39.669
THE OTHER WORD FEDERATED NOT --

02:44:39.736 --> 02:44:41.071
SO THERE'S SOME CENTRALIZED

02:44:41.137 --> 02:44:43.073
COLLECTION OF DATA.

02:44:43.139 --> 02:44:45.308
FROM PRE K. THROUGH.

02:44:45.375 --> 02:44:46.743
COMPLETION OF WHATEVER THE

02:44:46.810 --> 02:44:50.046
INSTITUTION IS TO YEAR FOUR YEAR.

02:44:50.113 --> 02:44:51.581
AM I ABLE TO DO WILL I BE ABLE

02:44:51.648 --> 02:44:54.217
TO TELL THAT BECAUSE JANE.

02:44:54.284 --> 02:44:57.220
A DIDN'T TAKE --

02:44:57.287 --> 02:45:01.091
GEOMETRY AND HER SOPHOMORE YEAR.

02:45:01.157 --> 02:45:02.025
THAT.

02:45:02.092 --> 02:45:04.227
THERE'S SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN

02:45:04.294 --> 02:45:07.530
WHAT JANE DID AT CAL STATE.

02:45:07.597 --> 02:45:08.898
NORTHRIDGE IN HER.

02:45:08.965 --> 02:45:12.068
MATH PROGRAM AND SHE WAS.

02:45:12.135 --> 02:45:15.438
A SOCIOLOGY MAJOR AND WHEN SHE

02:45:15.505 --> 02:45:17.707
GRADUATED.

02:45:17.774 --> 02:45:20.243
SHE GOT A JOB AT MCDONALD'S

02:45:20.310 --> 02:45:22.012
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO JOBS I MEAN

02:45:22.078 --> 02:45:23.346
WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS DATA IS

02:45:23.413 --> 02:45:25.348
THAT A FAIR QUESTION I'M NOT AN

02:45:25.415 --> 02:45:27.951
EDUCATOR I'M LOOKING AT YOU ALL.

02:45:28.018 --> 02:45:30.053
SET UP LARGE MAYBE I SHOULD WAIT

02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:31.655
TO YOU ALL FINISH THEN LET ME

02:45:31.721 --> 02:45:32.822
ASK OKAY.

02:45:32.889 --> 02:45:34.324
SO WHO'S NEXT I'M HAPPY TO

02:45:34.391 --> 02:45:36.459
CONTINUE THE JANE AND ONE AND

02:45:36.526 --> 02:45:36.660
NOW.

02:45:36.726 --> 02:45:38.895
THAT'S MY QUESTION I CAN DO THAT --

02:45:38.962 --> 02:45:41.598
SO AGAIN TALKING THROUGH A K.

02:45:41.665 --> 02:45:43.466
TWELVE SYSTEM BECAUSE THE STATE

02:45:43.533 --> 02:45:44.434
IS INVESTED IN A LUNCHEON OF

02:45:44.501 --> 02:45:46.736
DATA SYSTEM FOR K. TWELVE SINCE

02:45:46.803 --> 02:45:48.138
TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WE CAN

02:45:48.204 --> 02:45:49.773
TELL THAT JANE TOOK.

02:45:49.839 --> 02:45:51.574
GEOMETRY WHAT KIND OF GRADE SHE

02:45:51.641 --> 02:45:53.276
GOT WHETHER OR NOT SHE COMPLETED

02:45:53.343 --> 02:45:55.312
HIGH SCHOOL IN THE FOUR YEARS

02:45:55.378 --> 02:45:56.880
ARE SHE COMPLETED IT AT A LATER

02:45:56.946 --> 02:45:59.683
DATE WE CAN TELL A. F. AS SHE

02:45:59.749 --> 02:46:01.384
WAS FORTUNATELY DISADVANTAGED IF

02:46:01.451 --> 02:46:03.920
SHE WAS A FOSTER USE IF --

02:46:03.987 --> 02:46:05.622
IF SAME THINGS WITH --

02:46:05.689 --> 02:46:06.156
ONE IF ONE OF THE MORE IN

02:46:06.222 --> 02:46:07.791
ENGLISH LEARNERS SO WE ARE ABLE

02:46:07.857 --> 02:46:09.092
TO CAPTURE THAT KIND OF

02:46:09.159 --> 02:46:10.827
INFORMATION --

02:46:10.894 --> 02:46:14.264
WE DO HAVE DATA SHARING

02:46:14.331 --> 02:46:17.300
AGREEMENTS WITH ENTERED INTO

02:46:17.367 --> 02:46:18.301
SOME OF THOSE AT TERRY

02:46:18.368 --> 02:46:20.136
DETERMINES FOR THE VERY REASON

02:46:20.203 --> 02:46:21.905
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT.

02:46:21.971 --> 02:46:23.073
WHAT ARE THEY MISSING OR WHAT

02:46:23.139 --> 02:46:24.674
HOW CAN WE AVOID --

02:46:24.741 --> 02:46:25.942
HAVING STUDENTS GOING TO RADIO

02:46:26.009 --> 02:46:27.410
EDUCATION AT THE COMMUNITY

02:46:27.477 --> 02:46:28.778
COLLEGE LEVEL --

02:46:28.845 --> 02:46:29.979
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT

02:46:30.046 --> 02:46:32.682
KIND OF AT AT ED CLASSES ARE

02:46:32.749 --> 02:46:33.883
REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE

02:46:33.950 --> 02:46:35.318
THAT STUDENTS ARE PREPARED FOR

02:46:35.385 --> 02:46:36.853
FOR MATH IN COLLEGE BUT THE KIDS

02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:37.954
FOLLOW UP LEVEL THAT'S WE

02:46:38.021 --> 02:46:39.522
COLLECT THAT WOULD HELP WITH

02:46:39.589 --> 02:46:41.558
WITH WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

02:46:41.624 --> 02:46:43.326
OKAY AND THEN I AM I'LL JUST TRY

02:46:43.393 --> 02:46:44.294
ANOTHER QUESTION BUT I'M GONNA

02:46:44.361 --> 02:46:46.096
LET EVERYBODY PHOENICIAN SO THEN

02:46:46.162 --> 02:46:47.797
MIKE MY MY REAL QUESTION IS

02:46:47.864 --> 02:46:48.898
WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE WHAT WE

02:46:48.965 --> 02:46:52.936
REALLY DO WITH THAT DATA ONCE WE

02:46:53.002 --> 02:46:54.537
FIND.

02:46:54.604 --> 02:46:55.205
WHAT'S WE GATHER WRITTEN AND WE

02:46:55.271 --> 02:46:56.272
COME TO A CONCLUSION THAT

02:46:56.339 --> 02:46:57.040
SOMEBODY MISTER MATH COURSE OR

02:46:57.107 --> 02:46:59.275
WHATEVER WHAT WHAT'S THE IMPACT

02:46:59.342 --> 02:47:00.343
OF THE DATA.

02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:01.878
AND HOW DO WE USE IT IN THE

02:47:01.945 --> 02:47:02.746
LARGER.

02:47:02.812 --> 02:47:03.980
IN THE LARGER SCHEME OF THINGS

02:47:04.047 --> 02:47:06.516
WHICH IS WE EDUCATE PEOPLE.

02:47:06.583 --> 02:47:08.218
FOR SOCIETY IN THE WORKPLACE AND

02:47:08.284 --> 02:47:09.986
HOW THE PIECES FIT TOGETHER

02:47:10.053 --> 02:47:13.223
WHO'S NEXT.

02:47:13.289 --> 02:47:15.125
ALL MOVE ALL START CHRISTMAS

02:47:15.191 --> 02:47:15.658
WHEN YOU'RE THE CALIFORNIA

02:47:15.725 --> 02:47:16.893
COMMUNITY COLLEGES I THINK YOUR

02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:18.762
QUESTION IS THE CRUX OF KIND OF

02:47:18.828 --> 02:47:20.330
THIS DISCUSSION WE OFTEN START

02:47:20.397 --> 02:47:21.798
WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AND WITH THE

02:47:21.865 --> 02:47:22.799
MEASURES.

02:47:22.866 --> 02:47:24.200
HAVE HOW DO WE ACTUALLY GET THE

02:47:24.267 --> 02:47:25.535
DATA TOGETHER.

02:47:25.602 --> 02:47:26.069
I THINK THE HEART OF THE

02:47:26.136 --> 02:47:27.570
QUESTION YOUR CHEN TO GETS TO IT

02:47:27.637 --> 02:47:29.839
IS KIND OF WHO IS THE AUDIENCE

02:47:29.906 --> 02:47:31.408
AND WHAT ARE THEIR GOALS --

02:47:31.474 --> 02:47:32.709
HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU MAYBE IT

02:47:32.776 --> 02:47:35.512
MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO TALK THROUGH

02:47:35.578 --> 02:47:37.547
WAYS WE USE DATA TODAY.

02:47:37.614 --> 02:47:38.314
AND WAYS A LONGITUDINAL DATA

02:47:38.381 --> 02:47:39.349
SYSTEM MIGHT BE BETTER

02:47:39.416 --> 02:47:41.718
CHANCELLOR OAKLEY --

02:47:41.785 --> 02:47:42.285
TALKED ABOUT THE VISION FOR

02:47:42.352 --> 02:47:42.652
SUCCESS.

02:47:42.719 --> 02:47:43.653
COR GOALS OF IMPROVING OUTCOMES

02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:46.122
REDUCE.

02:47:46.189 --> 02:47:47.624
THAT VISION FOR SUCCESS WAS

02:47:47.690 --> 02:47:49.659
PREDICATED ON OUR EXISTING

02:47:49.726 --> 02:47:51.594
ASSESSMENT OF KIND OF STATEWIDE

02:47:51.661 --> 02:47:52.896
AND ACROSS REGIONS ACROSS

02:47:52.962 --> 02:47:54.531
DISTRICTS WHERE WE SEE GAPS IN

02:47:54.597 --> 02:47:56.232
PERFORMANCE WHAT WE DO ABOUT

02:47:56.299 --> 02:47:57.133
THEM SO I THINK.

02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:59.302
THAT OF ONE AUDIENCE IS STATE

02:47:59.369 --> 02:48:01.905
POLICYMAKERS ARE BOARDS FIGURING

02:48:01.971 --> 02:48:03.873
OUT HOW TO IDENTIFY THE GOALS

02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:05.408
WHAT INTERVENTIONS TO BE PUT IN

02:48:05.475 --> 02:48:07.177
PLACE ONE OF THE INTERVENTIONS

02:48:07.243 --> 02:48:08.511
LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR PUT IN

02:48:08.578 --> 02:48:09.579
PLACE LAST YEAR.

02:48:09.646 --> 02:48:11.481
WAS A NEW FUNDING FORMULA THAT

02:48:11.548 --> 02:48:13.850
LARGELY RELIED ON OUR EXISTING

02:48:13.917 --> 02:48:16.052
DATA OF THE NUMBER OF YOU KNOW

02:48:16.119 --> 02:48:18.354
LOW INCOME STUDENTS ACROSS

02:48:18.421 --> 02:48:19.355
DISTRICTS.

02:48:19.422 --> 02:48:19.889
OUT COMES ACROSS DISTRICTS

02:48:19.956 --> 02:48:21.558
THAT'S ONE THING WE COULD DO

02:48:21.624 --> 02:48:23.493
DIFFERENTLY --

02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:24.461
YOU KNOW WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF

02:48:24.527 --> 02:48:25.829
DATA -- YOU

02:48:25.895 --> 02:48:27.464
KNOW A LONG STANDING ROLE FOR

02:48:27.530 --> 02:48:29.165
DINNER SYSTEM HAS BEEN PUBLIC

02:48:29.232 --> 02:48:30.500
TRANSPARENCY THAT WE HAVE SAID.

02:48:30.567 --> 02:48:32.469
DATA IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE CAN

02:48:32.535 --> 02:48:33.803
GIVE COMMUNITIES MORE

02:48:33.870 --> 02:48:36.573
INFORMATION ABOUT THE STUDENTS.

02:48:36.639 --> 02:48:37.841
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS

02:48:37.907 --> 02:48:38.775
THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE

02:48:38.842 --> 02:48:40.443
SERVING AND HOW WELL THEY'RE

02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:41.978
SERVING THEIR STILL STUDENTS WE

02:48:42.045 --> 02:48:42.712
HAVE --

02:48:42.779 --> 02:48:44.914
SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN HAVE HAD A

02:48:44.981 --> 02:48:46.449
STUDENT SUCCESS CORKER SCORECARD

02:48:46.516 --> 02:48:48.151
AIMING TO DO JUST THAT TO SAY

02:48:48.218 --> 02:48:49.686
HERE'S THE YOU KNOW HERE'S THE

02:48:49.752 --> 02:48:50.854
PERFORMANCE OF YOUR COMMUNITY

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:51.921
COLLEGE DISTRICT.

02:48:51.988 --> 02:48:53.857
YOU AS A COMMUNITY MEMBERS A

02:48:53.923 --> 02:48:56.626
STUDENT AS A FAMILY MEMBER CAN

02:48:56.693 --> 02:48:58.828
WORK WITH YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:48:58.895 --> 02:49:00.029
TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES.

02:49:00.096 --> 02:49:04.567
BLAST EXAMPLE AND AND WHAT I

02:49:04.634 --> 02:49:07.337
THIS I THINK CRITICAL TO OUR USE

02:49:07.403 --> 02:49:08.505
OF DATA --

02:49:08.571 --> 02:49:09.772
HIS MAKING SURE A NEW DATA

02:49:09.839 --> 02:49:12.942
SYSTEM IS ABLE TO BE ACCESSED BY

02:49:13.009 --> 02:49:14.844
LOCAL PRACTITIONERS --

02:49:14.911 --> 02:49:15.545
YOU KNOW CHANCELLOR OAKLEY THIS

02:49:15.612 --> 02:49:16.846
MORNING TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE

02:49:16.913 --> 02:49:18.982
WORK WE'VE DONE ON MAKING SURE

02:49:19.048 --> 02:49:21.985
MORE STUDENTS ENTER COLLEGE

02:49:22.051 --> 02:49:24.721
LEVEL COURSES.

02:49:24.787 --> 02:49:26.155
NOPE.

02:49:26.222 --> 02:49:26.756
PROCEED THROUGH COLLEGE LEVEL

02:49:26.823 --> 02:49:27.790
COURSES ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH

02:49:27.857 --> 02:49:30.727
WE HISTORICALLY HAD RELIED --

02:49:30.793 --> 02:49:32.061
ONE OF THE TOOLS WE HAD RELIED

02:49:32.128 --> 02:49:33.630
ON FOR PURPOSES OF PLACEMENT HAD

02:49:33.696 --> 02:49:35.532
BEEN AN ASSESSMENT BUT YOU COME

02:49:35.598 --> 02:49:36.533
TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES YOU

02:49:36.599 --> 02:49:37.700
TAKE A PLACEMENT EXAM YOUR

02:49:37.767 --> 02:49:39.335
PLACEMENT EXAM TELLS YOU WHAT

02:49:39.402 --> 02:49:39.736
COURSES YOU'RE.

02:49:39.802 --> 02:49:40.803
READY.

02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:42.705
FOR WHAT WE HAVE MOVED TO IS

02:49:42.772 --> 02:49:44.340
LOOKING AT HIGH SCHOL GRADES

02:49:44.407 --> 02:49:44.941
AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT

02:49:45.008 --> 02:49:47.243
HIGH SCHOOL GRADES TLL US MUCH

02:49:47.310 --> 02:49:47.544
MORE.

02:49:47.610 --> 02:49:48.578
ABOUT WHAT A STUDENT --

02:49:48.645 --> 02:49:50.213
HOW READY A STUDENT IS FOR

02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:52.015
COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES --

02:49:52.081 --> 02:49:53.216
YOU KNOW WE COULD DO THAT ON A

02:49:53.283 --> 02:49:55.018
SELF REPORT BASIS STUDENTS CAN

02:49:55.084 --> 02:49:56.986
TELL US WHAT THEIR GPA WAS WHAT

02:49:57.053 --> 02:49:58.121
COURSES THEY TOOK.

02:49:58.187 --> 02:49:59.322
BUT I THINK WHAT GIVES US MUCH

02:49:59.389 --> 02:50:01.124
MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM IS

02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:02.258
AN ABILITY TO LOOK AT THEIR HIGH

02:50:02.325 --> 02:50:03.359
SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS.

02:50:03.426 --> 02:50:04.661
AND USE THAT FOR PLACEMENT

02:50:04.727 --> 02:50:06.629
DECISIONS SO I THINK AS WE TALK

02:50:06.696 --> 02:50:08.498
WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT KIND OF THE

02:50:08.565 --> 02:50:10.833
RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS PURPOSE OF

02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:11.434
TRADING LODGINGS PEOPLE THIS

02:50:11.501 --> 02:50:12.101
SYSTEM.

02:50:12.168 --> 02:50:14.971
I THINK WHAT WE THINK IS

02:50:15.038 --> 02:50:18.708
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT --

02:50:18.775 --> 02:50:20.944
WANTS TO THIS POINT TWO POINTS I

02:50:21.010 --> 02:50:23.246
WOULD JUST MAKE A BEFORE I CLOSE.

02:50:23.313 --> 02:50:25.315
THE FIRST IS THAT YOU KNOW I

02:50:25.381 --> 02:50:25.949
THINK.

02:50:26.015 --> 02:50:28.117
THE CLEAR KIND OF TAKE AWAY FROM

02:50:28.184 --> 02:50:29.919
US FROM THOSE EXAMPLES IS THAT

02:50:29.986 --> 02:50:31.621
WE CAN HAVE A BETTER OUTCOME

02:50:31.688 --> 02:50:33.156
MEASUREMENTS --

02:50:33.222 --> 02:50:34.757
IF WE CONNECTOR DATA THAT AS YOU

02:50:34.824 --> 02:50:36.125
MENTIONED YOU KNOW OUR GOAL IS

02:50:36.192 --> 02:50:37.760
NOT SIMPLY TO AWARD SOMEONE IT

02:50:37.827 --> 02:50:39.896
AGREE OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE

02:50:39.963 --> 02:50:40.597
THAT THEY SUCCEED IN THE WORK

02:50:40.663 --> 02:50:42.799
FORCE THE BUT YET EMPLOYMENT IN

02:50:42.865 --> 02:50:43.933
THE FIELD OF STUDY THAT PAY

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:44.267
ACHIEVEMENT.

02:50:44.334 --> 02:50:45.768
FILED A LIVING WAGE THAT IS ONLY

02:50:45.835 --> 02:50:47.437
POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE SHARE DATA

02:50:47.503 --> 02:50:49.606
AND EDIE SHARES DATA WITH US.

02:50:49.672 --> 02:50:52.308
I THINK THE OTHER POINT I WOULD

02:50:52.375 --> 02:50:54.110
JUST MAKE --

02:50:54.177 --> 02:50:55.411
YOU KNOW OUR DATA DOESN'T ACT ON

02:50:55.478 --> 02:50:56.512
IT SO THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT

02:50:56.579 --> 02:50:57.480
SHOULDN'T STOP US FROM KIND OF

02:50:57.547 --> 02:50:58.915
TALKING ABOUT IN ACTUALLY

02:50:58.982 --> 02:50:59.782
PUTTING TOGETHER LONGITUDINAL

02:50:59.849 --> 02:51:00.883
DATA SYSTEM.

02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:02.018
BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION WE

02:51:02.085 --> 02:51:03.853
ALSO NEED TO HAVE IS WHAT WE

02:51:03.920 --> 02:51:05.655
WANT TO CHANGE AND WHAT ARE THE

02:51:05.722 --> 02:51:07.056
DECISION POINTS THAT WE'RE GONNA

02:51:07.123 --> 02:51:08.224
USE -- TO TO

02:51:08.291 --> 02:51:09.859
MAKE THOSE CHANGES.

02:51:09.926 --> 02:51:12.128
I WILL HOLD THE REST OF MY

02:51:12.195 --> 02:51:13.296
COMMENTS AND HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL

02:51:13.363 --> 02:51:14.530
WELL I I YOU KNOW I'VE SAID FOR

02:51:14.597 --> 02:51:15.665
SOME TIME THAT --

02:51:15.732 --> 02:51:17.500
IN THE IN THE EDUCATION IN THE

02:51:17.567 --> 02:51:19.936
HIGHER EDUCATION FIELD --

02:51:20.003 --> 02:51:21.938
WE YOU ALL OF US NEED TO BE

02:51:22.005 --> 02:51:23.373
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WELL YOU'RE

02:51:23.439 --> 02:51:24.374
MEETING THE NEEDS OF YOUR

02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:26.142
CUSTOMERS AND YOUR CASE YOUR

02:51:26.209 --> 02:51:27.577
CUSTOMERS YOUR STUDENTS.

02:51:27.644 --> 02:51:29.379
AND ONE MEASURE OF THAT I THINK

02:51:29.445 --> 02:51:31.414
NOT BEING AN EDUCATOR IS A FIVE

02:51:31.481 --> 02:51:32.749
MOVE THROUGH A PROGRAM AND I GET

02:51:32.815 --> 02:51:35.251
A CERTIFICATE AT RIVERSIDE CITY

02:51:35.318 --> 02:51:37.920
COLLEGE OR I GET A A DEGREE AT

02:51:37.987 --> 02:51:39.822
RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE WITH A

02:51:39.889 --> 02:51:40.990
CONCENTRATION IN WHATEVER.

02:51:41.057 --> 02:51:43.660
WHAT WHAT AM I DOING TWO YEARS

02:51:43.726 --> 02:51:44.227
FROM NOW?

02:51:44.293 --> 02:51:45.962
IN MY IN MY ABLE TO TRANSLATE

02:51:46.029 --> 02:51:47.730
THAT INTO SOME SOMETHING THAT'S

02:51:47.797 --> 02:51:49.298
USEFUL.

02:51:49.365 --> 02:51:51.067
OR DOES THE MARKET PLACE NOT

02:51:51.134 --> 02:51:52.802
CARE ABOUT WHAT I DID AT

02:51:52.869 --> 02:51:54.270
RIVERSIDE CITY COLLEGE IN WHICH

02:51:54.337 --> 02:51:55.438
CASE.

02:51:55.505 --> 02:51:57.573
I WOULD BE NICE IF I HAD KNOWN

02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:59.542
THAT GOING IN.

02:51:59.609 --> 02:52:01.344
AND ONE ELEMENT OF THIS

02:52:01.411 --> 02:52:03.780
LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM IS

02:52:03.846 --> 02:52:05.381
PERHAPS IF IT WORKS.

02:52:05.448 --> 02:52:07.183
I'LL BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT AND

02:52:07.250 --> 02:52:09.285
CAN MAKE DECISIONS I MAY DO WHAT

02:52:09.352 --> 02:52:11.220
I DID ANYWAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

02:52:11.287 --> 02:52:13.890
I WANT TO DO BUT BE NICE TO HAVE

02:52:13.956 --> 02:52:14.290
THAT INFORMATION.

02:52:14.357 --> 02:52:15.992
OKAY MAYBE PRIDE TWO EXAMPLES --

02:52:16.059 --> 02:52:17.226
YOU KNOW I THINK IN AND I THINK

02:52:17.293 --> 02:52:18.995
THAT EXAMPLE HIGHLIGHTS KIND OF

02:52:19.062 --> 02:52:19.862
THE MIND SHIFT --

02:52:19.929 --> 02:52:21.330
MINDSET SHIFT THAT WE NEED TO

02:52:21.397 --> 02:52:24.233
MAKE A SENSE TO LONG TIME WE

02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:26.669
HAVE RELIED ON TRANSFER READY.

02:52:26.736 --> 02:52:28.271
AS THE WAY IN WHICH WE ASSESS

02:52:28.337 --> 02:52:30.106
WHETHER WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB

02:52:30.173 --> 02:52:30.873
MEETING OUR TRANSFORMATION THAT

02:52:30.940 --> 02:52:31.274
WE SAID.

02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:32.341
YOU KNOW IF THE STUDENT IS

02:52:32.408 --> 02:52:34.143
TAKING THE RIGHT COURSES AT A

02:52:34.210 --> 02:52:35.311
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

02:52:35.378 --> 02:52:36.779
THE COURSES THEY NEED TO

02:52:36.846 --> 02:52:38.448
TRANSFER THE UC AND CSU WE WILL

02:52:38.514 --> 02:52:40.083
SEE THAT AS KIND OF YOU KNOW

02:52:40.149 --> 02:52:41.951
SUCCESS FOR OUR INSTITUTIONS ONE

02:52:42.018 --> 02:52:42.719
OF THE THINGS THE VISION FOR

02:52:42.785 --> 02:52:44.620
SUCCESS DID WAS SAY WE ACTUALLY

02:52:44.687 --> 02:52:46.122
SHOULD CARE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

02:52:46.189 --> 02:52:47.790
THEY ACTUALLY TRANSFERRED TO UC

02:52:47.857 --> 02:52:50.126
AND CSU. FOR THEIRS I THINK THE

02:52:50.193 --> 02:52:51.260
POLICY DECISION THAT NEEDS TO BE

02:52:51.327 --> 02:52:52.729
MADE BUT TO SUPPORT THE POLICY

02:52:52.795 --> 02:52:53.963
DECISION --

02:52:54.030 --> 02:52:55.431
YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL DATA THAT

02:52:55.498 --> 02:52:56.866
WOULD LET US KNOW THAT WE NOW

02:52:56.933 --> 02:52:58.367
GET FROM YOU SEE CSU IN THIS

02:52:58.434 --> 02:53:00.970
NATIONAL STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE

02:53:01.037 --> 02:53:01.504
BUT SAYS THIS IS WHERE THE

02:53:01.571 --> 02:53:03.573
STUDENT.

02:53:03.639 --> 02:53:04.140
WHAT TO AFTER THEY LEFT YOUR

02:53:04.207 --> 02:53:04.741
INSTITUTION I THINK THE OTHER

02:53:04.807 --> 02:53:06.175
EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE WORK THAT

02:53:06.242 --> 02:53:06.976
WE'VE DONE AROUND OUR SALARY

02:53:07.043 --> 02:53:08.177
SURFER?

02:53:08.244 --> 02:53:10.246
THAT NOW GIVES STUDENTS THE

02:53:10.313 --> 02:53:12.181
INFORMATION THEY NEED TO SAY IF

02:53:12.248 --> 02:53:13.950
I MAJOR IN ACTS ARE A COMPLETE

02:53:14.016 --> 02:53:14.550
THIS PROGRAM OF THE COMMUNITY

02:53:14.617 --> 02:53:16.552
COLLEGES HERE'S THE REASONABLE

02:53:16.619 --> 02:53:18.554
EXPECTATION I CAN HAVE.

02:53:18.621 --> 02:53:19.856
BUT THE CAREERS I CAN ENTER INTO

02:53:19.922 --> 02:53:20.389
AFTER IT.

02:53:20.456 --> 02:53:22.158
AND THAT WILL INFORM OUR CAREER

02:53:22.225 --> 02:53:25.294
TECH EDUCATION C. T. E. EFFORTS.

02:53:25.361 --> 02:53:27.764
DIRECTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN SEE

02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:28.898
THAT THERE'S LIGHT AT THE END OF

02:53:28.965 --> 02:53:30.066
THE TUNNEL AND IF THEY GO

02:53:30.133 --> 02:53:31.734
THROUGH THIS PROGRAM.

02:53:31.801 --> 02:53:32.301
SOMETHING GOOD IS GOING TO

02:53:32.368 --> 02:53:33.369
HAPPEN TO THEM.

02:53:33.436 --> 02:53:34.604
YES THEY COULD BUT I THINK

02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:36.272
THAT'S I THINK WE NEED TO PLACE

02:53:36.339 --> 02:53:37.140
ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW I THINK

02:53:37.206 --> 02:53:38.508
AGAIN THE DATE ON ITS OWN

02:53:38.574 --> 02:53:40.243
DOESN'T DO THAT I THINK WE NEED

02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:40.977
TO HAVE A PLACE WHERE WE'RE

02:53:41.043 --> 02:53:42.311
HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND

02:53:42.378 --> 02:53:43.179
SAYING.

02:53:43.246 --> 02:53:44.714
THE DATA WE GET FROM THE SYSTEM

02:53:44.781 --> 02:53:46.048
ABOUT WHERE STUDENTS ARE GOING

02:53:46.115 --> 02:53:47.350
AND WHAT THE YOU KNOW WHERE

02:53:47.416 --> 02:53:49.085
THEY'RE OUR CAREERS AT A LIVING

02:53:49.152 --> 02:53:50.620
WAGE I HAD.

02:53:50.686 --> 02:53:51.821
SHOULD BE INFORMING OUR DECISION

02:53:51.888 --> 02:53:54.857
I THINK WE NEED WE BUILD THE

02:53:54.924 --> 02:53:56.225
DATA SYSTEM CREATE THAT SPACE

02:53:56.292 --> 02:53:57.226
FOR THAT CONVERSATION AND MAKE

02:53:57.293 --> 02:53:59.162
SURE THAT THE PRIORITY.

02:53:59.228 --> 02:53:59.662
AND I GUESS IN THE OTHER

02:53:59.729 --> 02:54:00.196
QUESTION IS.

02:54:00.263 --> 02:54:02.131
DATA ACCESSIBLE YOU WERE TALKING

02:54:02.198 --> 02:54:03.499
ABOUT BEING ACCESSIBLE AMONG YOU

02:54:03.566 --> 02:54:04.700
ALL.

02:54:04.767 --> 02:54:06.569
IS SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO TO

02:54:06.636 --> 02:54:09.138
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.

02:54:09.205 --> 02:54:11.440
I THINK THAT'S A CORE

02:54:11.507 --> 02:54:12.642
INTERNATIONAL BUT OTHERS GET IT.

02:54:12.708 --> 02:54:13.810
WELL I THINK THAT'S A CALL OR

02:54:13.876 --> 02:54:14.977
KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT WE

02:54:15.044 --> 02:54:16.012
NEED TO HAVE ABOUT GOVERNMENT'S

02:54:16.078 --> 02:54:17.847
ABOUT WHO IS THE AUDIENCE WHAT

02:54:17.914 --> 02:54:19.248
DO THEY NEED TO DO WITH THE DATA.

02:54:19.315 --> 02:54:21.184
AND HOW DO WE BALANCE PRIVACY

02:54:21.250 --> 02:54:23.286
CONCERNS WITH --

02:54:23.352 --> 02:54:26.122
THAT USE OF DATA.

02:54:26.189 --> 02:54:26.923
THANKS TO THE SO I THINK WHAT

02:54:26.989 --> 02:54:27.723
MAYBE CONTINUE ON THE POT

02:54:27.790 --> 02:54:28.925
SECONDARY SEGMENT --

02:54:28.991 --> 02:54:30.159
AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR

02:54:30.226 --> 02:54:31.294
OTHER COLLEAGUES --

02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:32.395
ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS NATHAN

02:54:32.461 --> 02:54:34.130
EVANS I AM THE CHIEF OF STAFF

02:54:34.197 --> 02:54:36.265
AND SENIOR ADVISER FOR ACADEMIC

02:54:36.332 --> 02:54:37.333
AND STUDENT AFFAIRS AT THE CSU

02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:38.501
OFF THE CHANCELLOR AND I'M GONNA

02:54:38.568 --> 02:54:39.335
DISPENSED WITH SOME OF MY

02:54:39.402 --> 02:54:41.037
PREPARED COMMENTS BECAUSE I

02:54:41.103 --> 02:54:42.738
THINK -- TO

02:54:42.805 --> 02:54:43.973
TO MISTER AND MENUS POINTING AND

02:54:44.040 --> 02:54:45.107
DISCUSSION A LOT OF IT IS

02:54:45.174 --> 02:54:46.742
TALKING ABOUT SCENARIOS THINGS

02:54:46.809 --> 02:54:48.511
SUCCESSES BECAUSE THERE'S A

02:54:48.578 --> 02:54:49.579
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DATA

02:54:49.645 --> 02:54:50.913
SHARING HAPPENING AMONG ALL

02:54:50.980 --> 02:54:52.582
AMONGST ALL THE ENTITIES YOU

02:54:52.648 --> 02:54:53.349
HAVE BEFORE YOU --

02:54:53.416 --> 02:54:56.319
SOME OF IT IS PUBLIC IN TERMS OF

02:54:56.385 --> 02:54:58.955
THE EXAMPLE THAT KRISTIN

02:54:59.021 --> 02:55:02.291
MENTIONED THE D. OUTCOMES SO

02:55:02.358 --> 02:55:04.594
LOOKING BY CAMPUS BY DISCIPLINE

02:55:04.660 --> 02:55:05.895
WHERE OUR STUDENTS LAND IN THE

02:55:05.962 --> 02:55:07.563
CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE TODAY

02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:08.831
BACKWARDS MAPPING YOU KNOW FOR

02:55:08.898 --> 02:55:10.366
THROUGHOUT THE PAST DECADE --

02:55:10.433 --> 02:55:11.567
WE HAVE OTHER GREAT EXAMPLES AND

02:55:11.634 --> 02:55:12.535
WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA

02:55:12.602 --> 02:55:14.537
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ENOUGH

02:55:14.604 --> 02:55:15.838
FOR EXAMPLE OUR LONG STANDING

02:55:15.905 --> 02:55:17.640
EARLY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM THAT

02:55:17.707 --> 02:55:18.608
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES

02:55:18.674 --> 02:55:20.376
ALSO PARTICIPATE IN WHICH IS

02:55:20.443 --> 02:55:21.444
USING THE SMARTER BALANCED

02:55:21.510 --> 02:55:22.812
ASSESSMENT ELEVENTH GRADE.

02:55:22.879 --> 02:55:24.747
AND LOOKING AT THAT AS A

02:55:24.814 --> 02:55:26.249
PRODUCTIVE AND AYE AYE PREDICTOR

02:55:26.315 --> 02:55:27.650
OF COLLEGE READINESS IN ENGLISH

02:55:27.717 --> 02:55:29.018
AND MATH.

02:55:29.085 --> 02:55:30.920
WELL THE REALITY IS --

02:55:30.987 --> 02:55:32.688
WHEN WE WORKED WITH CITY ON ON

02:55:32.755 --> 02:55:33.556
LOOKING AT A LONGER RANGE OF

02:55:33.623 --> 02:55:34.223
DATA?

02:55:34.290 --> 02:55:36.025
WE COULD BACKWARDS MAP THAT TO

02:55:36.092 --> 02:55:36.859
STANDARDIZE THE THE SORT OF

02:55:36.926 --> 02:55:38.694
ANNUAL ASSESSMENT THAT'S DONE

02:55:38.761 --> 02:55:39.896
ALL THE WAY BACK TO THIRD GRADE

02:55:39.962 --> 02:55:41.497
SO THE NEEDS FOR INTERVENTION.

02:55:41.564 --> 02:55:42.598
WHILE THEY ARE IMPORTANT

02:55:42.665 --> 02:55:45.434
pGETTING READY IN STUDENTS READY

02:55:45.501 --> 02:55:47.503
FOR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION THE

02:55:47.570 --> 02:55:49.205
REALITY IS WE VIEW O LOOKING AT

02:55:49.272 --> 02:55:50.973
THAT DATA COMBINED BIG.

02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:51.874
COMBINING OUR TWO SEGMENTS

02:55:51.941 --> 02:55:53.542
REALLY INDICATED THAT THE

02:55:53.609 --> 02:55:55.144
EFFORTS HAD TO START FAR FARM

02:55:55.211 --> 02:55:56.012
EARLIER --

02:55:56.078 --> 02:55:57.213
ALL THE WAY IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

02:55:57.280 --> 02:55:58.681
AND SO IT'S ONLY THROUGH THE

02:55:58.748 --> 02:56:00.816
ABILITY TO SHARE --

02:56:00.883 --> 02:56:02.285
ON A REGULAR BASIS AND NOT JUST

02:56:02.351 --> 02:56:04.086
LOOKING AS A AT A POINT IN TIME

02:56:04.153 --> 02:56:05.054
AS WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE

02:56:05.121 --> 02:56:07.189
CHALLENGES WITH PAT BUT ABLE TO

02:56:07.256 --> 02:56:08.624
BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT THE DATA

02:56:08.691 --> 02:56:09.892
IT LONGITUDINALLY.

02:56:09.959 --> 02:56:10.826
ONLY TO FALL INFORM

02:56:10.893 --> 02:56:12.695
INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES BUT AS

02:56:12.762 --> 02:56:13.930
YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD TO TO

02:56:13.996 --> 02:56:15.631
INFORM STUDENTS FAMILIES AND

02:56:15.698 --> 02:56:17.166
COMMUNITIES FROM A CONSUMER

02:56:17.233 --> 02:56:18.567
STANDPOINT FROM --

02:56:18.634 --> 02:56:21.203
PLANNING AND CAPACITY PLANNING A

02:56:21.270 --> 02:56:22.571
STANDPOINT AND REALLY THAT'S IT

02:56:22.638 --> 02:56:23.940
I THINK THE CRUX OF OF WHAT CAN

02:56:24.006 --> 02:56:25.675
HAPPEN WITH WITH THIS DATA WE

02:56:25.741 --> 02:56:28.110
HAVE NUMEROUS PROJECTS WE CAN

02:56:28.177 --> 02:56:28.744
ALL TALK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE ARE

02:56:28.811 --> 02:56:29.245
ARE.

02:56:29.312 --> 02:56:30.212
ARE DOING A GREAT AMOUNT OF DATA

02:56:30.279 --> 02:56:31.514
SHARING BUT IT IS SORT OF

02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:33.783
PROJECT BASED AND IT IS REALLY

02:56:33.849 --> 02:56:35.017
LOOKING AT WHATEVER AYE AYE

02:56:35.084 --> 02:56:40.856
NARROW --

02:56:40.923 --> 02:56:41.457
TOPIC MIGHT BE AT ONE TIME SO

02:56:41.524 --> 02:56:45.828
THERE IS IN OWN I PRAY WORK OF

02:56:45.895 --> 02:56:47.530
OUR FACULTY OUR INSTITUTIONS TO

02:56:47.596 --> 02:56:49.365
INFORM THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE

02:56:49.432 --> 02:56:51.000
TO INFORM THE THE STATE --

02:56:51.067 --> 02:56:52.335

WE FOCUS QUITE A BIT ON THAT

02:58:56.959 --> 02:58:59.095
WE'VE LEVERAGED ARE OUR SYSTEM.

02:58:59.161 --> 02:59:01.030
TO INFORM THE MULTI YEAR

02:59:01.097 --> 02:59:01.464
FRAMEWORK THAT --

02:59:01.530 --> 02:59:03.999
CFO BROSS FROM TALKED ABOUT

02:59:04.066 --> 02:59:07.369
EARLIER TODAY MAKE SURE THEY

WERE MEETING THE GOALS THAT ARE

02:59:08.604 --> 02:59:10.873
THERE I'VE I'VE PUT TOGETHER AT

02:59:10.940 --> 02:59:13.175
A HANDOUT --

02:59:13.242 --> 02:59:15.211
THAT LAYS WHAT THE THE DATA

02:59:15.277 --> 02:59:16.679
SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE FOR US AT THE

02:59:16.745 --> 02:59:17.746
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHICH I

02:59:17.813 --> 02:59:20.082
APPRECIATE IS MUCH SIMPLER THAN --

02:59:20.149 --> 02:59:21.383
A MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AROUND

02:59:21.450 --> 02:59:22.952
THE TABLE THAT HAVE MANY MORE

02:59:23.018 --> 02:59:24.520
CAMPUSES AND DISTRICTS TO WORK

02:59:24.587 --> 02:59:25.654
WITH -- BUT

02:59:25.721 --> 02:59:27.223
IT HIGHLIGHTS THE DATA THAT WE

02:59:27.289 --> 02:59:28.791
COLLECT ON STUDENTS --

02:59:28.858 --> 02:59:30.659
UNDER THE INPUT SIDE IT

02:59:30.726 --> 02:59:32.261
HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE TOP AREAS

02:59:32.328 --> 02:59:33.829
OF THE DATA WAREHOUSE SIDE SOME

02:59:33.896 --> 02:59:35.097
OF THE KEY FUNCTIONS.

02:59:35.164 --> 02:59:37.066
AND THE WAYS THAT WE SHARE THAT

02:59:37.133 --> 02:59:39.668
INFORMATION THE OUTPUT --

02:59:39.735 --> 02:59:40.870
FOR THE AUDIENCES THAT WERE

02:59:40.936 --> 02:59:41.937
SERVING.

02:59:42.004 --> 02:59:43.205
OF THE KEY --

02:59:43.272 --> 02:59:45.141
AREA THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:59:45.207 --> 02:59:47.710
INVESTMENT AND TIME SPENT ON IS

02:59:47.776 --> 02:59:49.178
THIS DATA WAREHOUSE --

02:59:49.245 --> 02:59:51.113
SECTION OF IT THE NOT SOME BOLTS

02:59:51.180 --> 02:59:52.948
OF IT AND I'LL JUST MENTION FOR

02:59:53.015 --> 02:59:54.183
AREAS THAT I THINK A REALLY

02:59:54.250 --> 02:59:56.085
IMPORTANT CONSIDERING PUTTING

02:59:56.152 --> 02:59:58.220
TOGETHER STATEWIDE SYSTEM ONE IS

02:59:58.287 --> 03:00:00.089
THE QUALITY OF THE DATA --

03:00:00.156 --> 03:00:01.457
WE SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME

03:00:01.524 --> 03:00:02.992
CHECKING THE DATA THAT WE HAVE

03:00:03.058 --> 03:00:04.860
THAT COMES IN WE AUTOMATE THE

03:00:04.927 --> 03:00:06.495
PROCESS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND

03:00:06.562 --> 03:00:08.197
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS EACH YEAR

03:00:08.264 --> 03:00:09.632
SOMETHING SPECIAL COMES ALONG.

03:00:09.698 --> 03:00:11.800
AND WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND CHECK

03:00:11.867 --> 03:00:12.535
TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE

03:00:12.601 --> 03:00:14.270
GOING TO BE LOADING IS ACCURATE

03:00:14.336 --> 03:00:17.439
AND COMPLETE --

03:00:17.506 --> 03:00:20.142
WE HAVE SET UP THIS THIRTY IN

03:00:20.209 --> 03:00:21.677
PLACE THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:00:21.744 --> 03:00:23.312
MAINTAINED IT NEEDS TO BE

03:00:23.379 --> 03:00:24.446
UPGRADED --

03:00:24.513 --> 03:00:25.414
ALONG THE WAY SO THERE'S AN

03:00:25.481 --> 03:00:27.316
ONGOING INVESTMENT THAT NEEDS TO

03:00:27.383 --> 03:00:28.284
BE THERE.

03:00:28.350 --> 03:00:29.885
AND WE ALSO WORK QUITE A BIT ON

03:00:29.952 --> 03:00:32.021
ENSURING THAT WE'RE PROTECTING

03:00:32.087 --> 03:00:33.889
THE PRIVACY OF OUR STUDENTS.

03:00:33.956 --> 03:00:36.125
AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE

03:00:36.192 --> 03:00:38.260
THINK ABOUT THAT IS HOW WE SHARE

03:00:38.327 --> 03:00:40.229
THE INFORMATION --

03:00:40.296 --> 03:00:40.529
WITH -- THE

03:00:40.596 --> 03:00:41.797
PUBLIC.

03:00:41.864 --> 03:00:43.532
WE KNOW THE VALUE OF THE DATA

03:00:43.599 --> 03:00:45.501
THAT WE COLLECT SO WE FOCUSED A

03:00:45.568 --> 03:00:47.469
LOT ON GETTING INFORMATION OUT

03:00:47.536 --> 03:00:49.238
TO THE PUBLIC THROUGH THE YOU

03:00:49.305 --> 03:00:50.839
SEE ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT THAT

03:00:50.906 --> 03:00:52.341
WE'VE STARTED WHICH HAS.

03:00:52.408 --> 03:00:54.810
GOT INFORMATION ON OPERATIONS

03:00:54.877 --> 03:00:56.712
ACROSS THE BOARD --

03:00:56.779 --> 03:00:59.348
WE SHIFT MORE INFORMATION NOW

03:00:59.415 --> 03:01:00.649
INTO WHAT WE CALL ARE YOU SEE

03:01:00.716 --> 03:01:02.618
INFORMATION CENTER IT'S THE

03:01:02.685 --> 03:01:04.186
INTERACTIVE WEBSITE --

03:01:04.253 --> 03:01:06.288
THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO GO IN

03:01:06.355 --> 03:01:07.923
AND WE ANSWER THE TOPPLING

03:01:07.990 --> 03:01:09.391
QUESTIONS BUT THEY HAVE SOME

03:01:09.458 --> 03:01:11.327
FUNCTIONALITY TO FILTER FOR

03:01:11.393 --> 03:01:12.661
CAMPUS OR LOOK AT IT FOR

03:01:12.728 --> 03:01:14.563
DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATIONS AND

03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:16.098
THAT GIVES THEM MORE INFORMATION.

03:01:16.165 --> 03:01:18.701
ON WHAT THEY CAN.

03:01:18.767 --> 03:01:20.636
LEARN ABOUT --

03:01:20.703 --> 03:01:21.237
IT ALSO GIVES US A LITTLE BIT

03:01:21.303 --> 03:01:24.306
MORE THE RESEARCH THAT WE NEED

03:01:24.373 --> 03:01:26.041
TO DO TO INFORM --

03:01:26.108 --> 03:01:28.077
THE UNIVERSITY THE STATE ON SOME

03:01:28.143 --> 03:01:29.878
OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE --

03:01:29.945 --> 03:01:31.780
ARE COMING UP AT SO THOSE ARE

03:01:31.847 --> 03:01:33.449
CRITICAL AREAS YOU --

03:01:33.515 --> 03:01:35.117
YOU RAISE SOME GOOD QUESTIONS

03:01:35.184 --> 03:01:36.485
ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

03:01:36.552 --> 03:01:38.020
YOU HOULD EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO

03:01:38.087 --> 03:01:39.455
GET OUT OF IT YOU KNOW ONE OF

03:01:39.521 --> 03:01:40.823
THE BENEFITS OF CALIFORNIA BEING

03:01:40.889 --> 03:01:42.124
IN THE SPACE THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT

03:01:42.191 --> 03:01:43.492
NOW IS THAT THERE ARE.

03:01:43.559 --> 03:01:44.927
A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES THAT

03:01:44.994 --> 03:01:46.762
YOU CAN LOOK TO TO FIND OUT WHAT

03:01:46.829 --> 03:01:48.330
THEY DID WITH THEIR LESSONS

03:01:48.397 --> 03:01:49.665
LEARNED WERE --

03:01:49.732 --> 03:01:51.367
WHAT THEY COLLECT WHAT THE

03:01:51.433 --> 03:01:52.968
REPORT AND HOW THEY MANAGE

03:01:53.035 --> 03:01:54.703
RESEARCH AND THINK ABOUT THAT IN

03:01:54.770 --> 03:01:56.272
TERMS OF WHAT YOU WANT TO GET

03:01:56.338 --> 03:01:57.806
OUT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA?

03:01:57.873 --> 03:01:59.675
YOU RAISE A VERY INTERESTING

03:01:59.742 --> 03:02:01.510
QUESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW CAN I

03:02:01.577 --> 03:02:03.045
GET DOWN TO KNOWING IF SOMEBODY

03:02:03.112 --> 03:02:05.080
DIDN'T TAKE A GEOMETRY CLASS

03:02:05.147 --> 03:02:06.515
WILL THAT HAVE AN EFFECT ON WHAT

03:02:06.582 --> 03:02:06.849
IT IS.

03:02:06.915 --> 03:02:09.285
I THINK LAYING OUT THE QUESTIONS

03:02:09.351 --> 03:02:10.185
THAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO

03:02:10.252 --> 03:02:12.254
ANSWER IS A REALLY CRITICAL

03:02:12.321 --> 03:02:14.923
BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF WORK I

03:02:14.990 --> 03:02:16.525
CAN'T UNDER ESTIMATE.

03:02:16.592 --> 03:02:17.860
WHAT IT TAKES TO MAINTAIN A

03:02:17.926 --> 03:02:19.328
SYSTEM LIKE THIS --

03:02:19.395 --> 03:02:20.896
IFYOU WANTED TO BE ABLE TO

03:02:20.963 --> 03:02:23.165
COLLECT INFORMATION TO START MY

03:02:23.232 --> 03:02:24.466
MY RECOMMENDATION IS ALWAYS

03:02:24.533 --> 03:02:26.835
START SMALL SUCCEED LEARN FROM

03:02:26.902 --> 03:02:31.907
THAT AND AND BUILD --

03:02:31.974 --> 03:02:34.910
BUT WILL WE FAILED THAT.

03:02:34.977 --> 03:02:36.211
IT'S ITS IT'S SOMETHING I LIVE

03:02:36.278 --> 03:02:36.812
BY WITH WITH THESE KINDS OF

03:02:36.879 --> 03:02:37.413
PROJECTS BUT LIKE THEQUESTION

03:02:37.479 --> 03:02:38.213
THAT YOU ASKED ONE OF THE WAYS

03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:39.348
YOU COULD APPROACH IT IS.

03:02:39.415 --> 03:02:40.215
TO COLLECT INFORMATION THAT

03:02:40.282 --> 03:02:43.185
WOULD ALLOW YOU THE CHAINS ARE

03:02:43.252 --> 03:02:44.353
ONES I THINK THOSE ARE THE NAMES

03:02:44.420 --> 03:02:45.821
WERE WORKING WITH THAT ARE

03:02:45.888 --> 03:02:47.656
STRUGGLING FIND OUT IF THEY'RE

03:02:47.723 --> 03:02:49.291
CONCENTRATED WITHIN PARTICULAR

03:02:49.358 --> 03:02:50.225
DISTRICTS.

03:02:50.292 --> 03:02:51.694
AND THEN GO IN AND ASK FOR

03:02:51.760 --> 03:02:54.930
COURSE LEVEL DETAIL YOU KNOW YOU

03:02:54.997 --> 03:02:56.332
GO TO IN ORDER THAT SHE WAS IN

03:02:56.398 --> 03:02:57.900
IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU YOU NEED

03:02:57.966 --> 03:02:59.568
VARIOUS LEVELS HERE.

03:02:59.635 --> 03:03:02.538
IF I'M EDUCATORS.

03:03:02.604 --> 03:03:03.839
WHO ARE PLANNING FOR EDUCATORS?

03:09:39.968 --> 03:09:41.403
THAT SUFFICIENT IF THERE'S SOME

03:09:41.470 --> 03:09:43.405
OTHER INDIVIDUAL LEVEL --

03:09:43.472 --> 03:09:44.439
KIND OF QUESTION THAT FOLKS HAVE

03:09:44.506 --> 03:09:45.340
THOUGH IT --

03:09:45.407 --> 03:09:46.808
IT MAY NOT BE ESPECIALLY FOR

03:09:46.875 --> 03:09:48.543
LOOKING AT CERTAIN INDUSTRIES.

03:09:48.610 --> 03:09:49.544
THE OTHER POINT I WOULD JUST

03:09:49.611 --> 03:09:51.813
MAKE ON THAT POINT IS THAT --

03:09:51.880 --> 03:09:53.715
YOU KNOW WE WE ARE THINKING

03:09:53.782 --> 03:09:54.983
ABOUT THIS KIND OF IN A PIPELINE

03:09:55.050 --> 03:09:56.818
METAPHOR THAT WE OFTEN USE THAT

03:09:56.885 --> 03:09:57.686
STUDENTS GO FROM ONE PLACE TO

03:09:57.753 --> 03:09:58.987
THE OTHER --

03:09:59.054 --> 03:10:00.689
MANY TIMES STUDENTS YOU KNOW ARE

03:10:00.756 --> 03:10:01.823
TENDING MULTIPLE OF OUR

03:10:01.890 --> 03:10:03.391
INSTITUTIONS AT ONCE BUT THEY'RE

03:10:03.458 --> 03:10:05.260
ALSO ACCESSING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE

03:10:05.327 --> 03:10:05.961
PROGRAMS.

03:10:06.027 --> 03:10:07.295
THAT YOU KNOW WITH FOLKS THAT

03:10:07.362 --> 03:10:08.964
ARE NOT THIS TABLE TO CAL FRESH

03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:11.967
BUT IF IT'S CAL WORKS BENEFITS --

03:10:12.033 --> 03:10:12.701
THAT AGAIN DEPENDING ON THE

03:10:12.768 --> 03:10:14.069
QUESTION YOU KNOW CHANCE OAKLEY

03:10:14.136 --> 03:10:15.270
TALKED A LOT TODAY ABOUT

03:10:15.337 --> 03:10:16.972
STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS IF WE'RE

03:10:17.038 --> 03:10:18.807
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE

03:10:18.874 --> 03:10:20.375
STATE IS MEETING BASIC NEEDS.

03:10:20.442 --> 03:10:22.344
OF IT I THINK THOSE OTHER KIND

03:10:22.410 --> 03:10:24.346
OF UNDERSTANDING THE VARIETY OF

03:10:24.412 --> 03:10:25.781
PROGRAM STUDENTS ARE ACCESSING

03:10:25.847 --> 03:10:28.383
WOULD BE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT

03:10:28.450 --> 03:10:30.085
RIGHT I I AND AND I'M SURE.

03:10:30.152 --> 03:10:32.220
I JUST WAS CURIOUS BECAUSE OF

03:10:32.287 --> 03:10:33.655
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

03:10:33.722 --> 03:10:35.590
DATA POINT THE FRANCHISE TAX

03:10:35.657 --> 03:10:36.558
BOARD CAPTURES.

03:10:36.625 --> 03:10:38.393
A STATE INCOME TAX RETURN BUT MY

03:10:38.460 --> 03:10:39.561
RECOLLECTION IS YOU HAVE TO LIST

03:10:39.628 --> 03:10:41.963
YOUR OCCUPATION SO YOU MIGHT GET.

03:10:42.030 --> 03:10:42.864
A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THE

03:10:42.931 --> 03:10:46.601
OCCUPATION BEYOND INDUSTRY CODE

03:10:46.668 --> 03:10:47.803
BECAUSE INDUSTRY CO JUST SORT OF

03:10:47.869 --> 03:10:49.070
BROAD --

03:10:49.137 --> 03:10:50.539
THAT WOULD JUST BE ONE EXAMPLE I

03:10:50.605 --> 03:10:51.406
THINK AND THEN THEY'RE OTHER

03:10:51.473 --> 03:10:53.241
PEOPLE PROBABLY THERE MAY BE

03:10:53.308 --> 03:10:54.543
OTHER BE BE OTHER PEOPLE WHO.

03:10:54.609 --> 03:10:55.844
FOLLOW CALIFORNIA STATE INCOME

03:10:55.911 --> 03:10:57.179
TAX RETURN.

03:10:57.245 --> 03:10:59.481
BUT DON'T NECESSARILY WORK FOR

03:10:59.548 --> 03:11:01.416
AN EMPLOYER IN THE STATE OF

03:11:01.483 --> 03:11:02.017
CALIFORNIA.

03:11:02.083 --> 03:11:03.385
WERE THERE WOULD NOT BE AN

03:11:03.451 --> 03:11:04.686
EMPLOYER RETURN THAT HAD THAT

03:11:04.753 --> 03:11:06.988
CAPTURED THE EMPLOYEE I. I

03:11:07.055 --> 03:11:09.224
REALIZE I'M GETTING INTO.

03:11:09.291 --> 03:11:09.891
I LOVE YOU GETTING INTO THE READ

03:11:09.958 --> 03:11:11.459
THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WE LIVE AND

03:11:11.526 --> 03:11:13.128
OCCUPATION IS SORT OF THE HOLY

03:11:13.195 --> 03:11:14.629
GRAIL THAT WE ALWAYS WANT TO BE

03:11:14.696 --> 03:11:15.897
ABLE TO GET --

03:11:15.964 --> 03:11:17.799
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT TRYING TO

03:11:17.866 --> 03:11:19.601
ACCESS IT ON MANY OF THAT --

03:11:22.370 --> 03:11:24.306
UP BEING A TEXT FIELD.

03:11:24.372 --> 03:11:26.174
OF VERSES IN INDUSTRY CODE WHICH

03:11:26.241 --> 03:11:27.676
MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:11:27.742 --> 03:11:29.411
CHALLENGING TO WORK WITH BUT

03:11:29.477 --> 03:11:31.179

03:11:31.246 --> 03:11:33.481

03:11:33.548 --> 03:11:35.417
IT'S SO GETTING A SENSE AGAIN OF

03:11:35.483 --> 03:11:37.118

IN CALIFORNIA AND STUDENTS FROM

03:15:46.868 --> 03:15:47.769
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA OF

03:15:47.836 --> 03:15:50.305
INDICATED THAT THEY WANT A PLATE

03:15:50.371 --> 03:15:50.805
OF A CALIFORNIA COLLEGE

03:15:50.872 --> 03:15:51.739
UNIVERSITY.

03:15:51.806 --> 03:15:53.641
AND THAT CONTAINS DATE OF BIRTH

03:15:53.708 --> 03:15:57.412
AGE GENDER OR INFORMATION ABOUT

03:15:57.479 --> 03:15:58.179
THEIR INCOME THEIR PARENTS

03:15:58.246 --> 03:15:59.114
INCOME -- AN

03:15:59.180 --> 03:16:00.949
ADJUSTMENT AND SO FORTH AND THEN

03:16:01.015 --> 03:16:02.951
ALSO FROM ALL PUBLIC HIGH

03:16:03.017 --> 03:16:04.452
SCHOOLS IN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

03:16:04.519 --> 03:16:05.420
OF PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS IN

03:16:05.487 --> 03:16:07.322
CALIFORNIA WE RECEIVE --

03:16:07.388 --> 03:16:08.690
WAITED STUDENT GRADE POINT

03:16:08.756 --> 03:16:10.024
AVERAGE WHICH IS REQUIRED TO

03:16:10.091 --> 03:16:11.192
CALCULATE THE CAL GRANT

03:16:11.259 --> 03:16:13.428
ELIGIBILITY SO ARE CAL GRANT

03:16:13.495 --> 03:16:15.163
PROGRAMS HAVE THREE DIFFERENT

03:16:15.230 --> 03:16:16.631
GPA MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

03:16:16.698 --> 03:16:18.299
DEPENDING ON WHICH PROGRAM.

03:16:18.366 --> 03:16:20.602
THE STUDENT IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE

03:16:20.668 --> 03:16:23.204
WE RECEIVE ALL OF THAT AND WE

03:16:23.271 --> 03:16:24.606
USE THAT TO CALCULATE PRIMARILY

03:16:24.672 --> 03:16:26.741
STUDENT ELIGIBILITY WHICH IS OF

03:16:26.808 --> 03:16:28.209
COURSE OUR MAIN FUNCTION.

03:16:28.276 --> 03:16:32.113
AND THEN THE STUDENT CHEN OR WAN

03:16:32.180 --> 03:16:33.615
HEY THERE CAL GRANT OR ONE OF

03:16:33.681 --> 03:16:34.849
OUR OTHER PROGRAMS.

03:16:34.916 --> 03:16:37.519
AND FROM THERE ON I WILL SAY

03:16:37.585 --> 03:16:38.920
THAT OUR ACCESS TO THE DATA AS A

03:16:38.987 --> 03:16:40.388
STATE AGENCY.

03:16:40.455 --> 03:16:41.990
IS LIMITED AND I SAY THIS NOT IN

03:16:42.056 --> 03:16:43.591
ANY WAY WHATSOEVER TO THE

03:16:43.658 --> 03:16:45.193
SMARTER COLLEAGUES AT THE

03:16:45.260 --> 03:16:46.761
INSTITUTIONS ARE THE SEGMENTS.

03:16:46.828 --> 03:16:48.196
BUT BECAUSE THERE'S AND THERE

03:16:48.263 --> 03:16:49.731
HASN'T BEEN A LONGITUDINAL DATA

03:16:49.797 --> 03:16:51.065
BASE THAT INCORPORATES

03:16:51.132 --> 03:16:53.268
INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL AID

03:16:53.334 --> 03:16:54.736
OR ANY SORT OF STATE POLICY

03:16:54.802 --> 03:16:55.937
ABOUT THAT DATA.

03:16:56.004 --> 03:16:58.106
WE QUITE HONESTLY DO STRUGGLE

03:16:58.173 --> 03:17:00.074
WHEN WE ARE ASKED BY LEGISLATORS

03:17:00.141 --> 03:17:01.809
SUCH AS YOURSELVES BY OUTSIDE

03:17:01.876 --> 03:17:03.745
RESEARCH GROUPS THINGS LIKE WELL

03:17:03.811 --> 03:17:04.546
WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES OF

03:17:04.612 --> 03:17:05.780
FINANCIALLY DOES THE CAL GRANT

03:17:05.847 --> 03:17:06.714
PROGRAM.

03:17:06.781 --> 03:17:08.216
HELPS STUDENTS GRADUATE AS A

03:17:08.283 --> 03:17:09.951
STUDENT WHO RECEIVES A CAL GRANT

03:17:10.018 --> 03:17:12.554
MORE OR LESS LIKELY TO GRADUATE

03:17:12.620 --> 03:17:14.222
ON TIME THE STUDENTS SIMILAR

03:17:14.289 --> 03:17:16.357
CIRCUMSTANCE WHO DIDN'T RECEIVE

03:17:16.424 --> 03:17:18.092
A CAL GRANT.

03:17:18.159 --> 03:17:18.693
IF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION

03:17:18.760 --> 03:17:19.727
LEVEL ANYWAY WE DON'T RECEIVE

03:17:19.794 --> 03:17:21.196
GRADUATION DATA ON WHETHER A

03:17:21.262 --> 03:17:22.430
STUDENT THAT WE'RE PAYING HAS

03:17:22.497 --> 03:17:24.766
GRADUATED FROM THEIR COLLEGE

03:17:24.832 --> 03:17:26.534
UNIVERSITY OR HAS TRANSFERRED --

03:17:26.601 --> 03:17:28.369
WE KNOW WHEN THEY STOP GETTING

03:17:28.436 --> 03:17:29.370
PAID A CAL GRANT.

03:17:29.437 --> 03:17:31.472
BUT CAL GRANT HAS A FOUR YEAR

03:17:31.539 --> 03:17:32.974
LIFETIME ELIGIBILITY LIMIT SO

03:17:33.041 --> 03:17:34.909
THAT COULD EASILY BE A STUDENT

03:17:34.976 --> 03:17:35.743
AND WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF

03:17:35.810 --> 03:17:36.611
THE STUDENTS.

03:17:36.678 --> 03:17:38.279
WHO IS TAKING A LITTLE LONGER TO

03:17:38.346 --> 03:17:39.814
GRADUATE BUT HAS EXHAUSTED THEIR

03:17:39.881 --> 03:17:41.149
CALVIN ELIGIBILITY FROM THAT

03:17:41.216 --> 03:17:43.284
POINT ON WE DO NOT HAVE

03:17:43.351 --> 03:17:46.487
INFORMATION AT THE STATE AGENCY

03:17:46.554 --> 03:17:48.022
LEVEL ABOUT THAT STUDENT?

03:17:48.089 --> 03:17:49.557
ANOTHER LIMITATION ON OUR DATA --

03:17:49.624 --> 03:17:50.625
TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK HAS TO DO

03:17:50.692 --> 03:17:52.393
WITH RACE AND ETHNICITY OF ALL

03:17:52.460 --> 03:17:53.728
THE THINGS THE FAST SO DOES

03:17:53.795 --> 03:17:55.530
COLLECT IT NO LONGER COLLECTS

03:17:55.597 --> 03:17:56.297
INFORMATION --

03:17:56.364 --> 03:17:57.732
SELF REPORTED ON STUDENTS RACE

03:17:57.799 --> 03:18:00.201
OR ETHNICITY AND WE UNDERSTAND

03:18:00.268 --> 03:18:02.704
THAT THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST --

03:18:02.770 --> 03:18:04.305
THAT INTEREST IN KNOWING --

03:18:04.372 --> 03:18:06.941
ABOUT HOW STATE FINANCIAL AID IS

03:18:07.008 --> 03:18:08.076
OR IS NOT DISTRIBUTED IN AN

03:18:08.142 --> 03:18:09.143
EQUITABLE MANNER I MEAN

03:18:09.210 --> 03:18:11.045
OBVIOUSLY OFFICIALLY SPEAKING WE

03:18:11.112 --> 03:18:11.779
ARE.

03:18:11.846 --> 03:18:13.414
A RACE NEUTRAL IN TERMS OF HOW

03:18:13.481 --> 03:18:15.750
WE DISTRIBUTE IT BUT WE ARE

03:18:15.817 --> 03:18:17.485
UNABLE TO RELIABLY REPORT AGAIN

03:18:17.552 --> 03:18:19.554
AT THE STATE LEVEL INFORMATION

03:18:19.621 --> 03:18:20.955
ON THE DISBURSEMENT --

03:18:21.022 --> 03:18:22.290
THE DISTRIBUTION OF FINANCIAL

03:18:22.357 --> 03:18:23.658
AID BASED ON RACE OR ETHNICITY

03:18:23.725 --> 03:18:27.095
THEY DON'T YOU DON'T EVEN YOU'RE

03:18:27.161 --> 03:18:28.696
NOT EVEN PERMITTED --

03:18:28.763 --> 03:18:29.631
TO OF TERRA FORM BASIS FOR

03:18:29.697 --> 03:18:30.865
EXAMPLE KEEP.

03:18:30.932 --> 03:18:33.101
BLIND DATE IS TO RACE AND

03:18:33.167 --> 03:18:34.535
ETHNICITY IN TO KNOW WHO'S

03:18:34.602 --> 03:18:35.770
APPLIED.

03:18:35.837 --> 03:18:37.405
THAT'S CORRECT A LOT OF THAT HAS

03:18:37.472 --> 03:18:38.773
TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WITH

03:18:38.840 --> 03:18:40.441
THE EXCEPTION OF THE DREAMER

03:18:40.508 --> 03:18:42.377
POPULATION WHICH IS --

03:18:42.443 --> 03:18:43.945
A SMALL SUBSET OF THE STUDENTS

03:18:44.012 --> 03:18:45.513
WE SERVE MOST STUDENTS FELT THE

03:18:45.580 --> 03:18:46.981
FEDERAL APPLICATION TO GET STATE

03:18:47.048 --> 03:18:48.783
AID THERE'S NO SEPARATE CAL

03:18:48.850 --> 03:18:50.652
GRANT OR STATE CALIFORNIA

03:18:50.718 --> 03:18:52.053
APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL AID.

03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:54.555
AND SO WE'RE SORT OF SUBJECT TO

03:18:54.622 --> 03:18:55.390
THE WHIMS OF WHATEVER THE

03:18:55.456 --> 03:18:56.891
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES OR DOES

03:18:56.958 --> 03:18:58.926
NOT INCLUDE ON THE FAST THAT SO

03:18:58.993 --> 03:19:00.628
THAT'S THE THAT IS CORRECT --

03:19:00.695 --> 03:19:02.063
BUT WERE AWARE THAT THERE'S A

03:19:02.130 --> 03:19:03.698
LOT OF INTEREST IN THAT AND I

03:19:03.765 --> 03:19:04.966
THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

03:19:05.033 --> 03:19:06.267
HAVING SOME TYPE OF EITHER

03:19:06.334 --> 03:19:08.036
LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM OR JUST

03:19:08.102 --> 03:19:10.104
SORT OF STATE POLICY.

03:19:10.171 --> 03:19:11.739
AROUND DATA AND DATA SHARING --

03:19:11.806 --> 03:19:14.609
IT WOULD REALLY HELP IN TERMS OF

03:19:14.676 --> 03:19:16.244
THE WAY XIN HELP US NO --

03:19:16.311 --> 03:19:18.079
WHAT POPULATIONS WE MAY OR MAY

03:19:18.146 --> 03:19:19.547
NOT NEED TO TARGET MORE YOU KNOW

03:19:19.614 --> 03:19:20.882
FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR'S

03:19:20.948 --> 03:19:24.452
PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL-CAL GRANT AID TO STUDENTS WITH

03:19:24.519 --> 03:19:26.387
DEPENDENT CHILDREN --

03:19:26.454 --> 03:19:28.690
HAVING INFORMATION ABOUT HOW

03:19:28.756 --> 03:19:30.258
THOSE STUDENTS.

03:19:30.325 --> 03:19:32.160
GRADUATION OR ON TIME COMPLETION

03:19:32.226 --> 03:19:33.861
OF RATES ARE AFFECTED BY THE

03:19:33.928 --> 03:19:36.631
RECEIPT OF FINANCIAL AID WOULD

03:19:36.698 --> 03:19:37.832
BE ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL TO US IN

03:19:37.899 --> 03:19:39.367
KNOWING HOW TO EVALUATE SUCH A

03:19:39.434 --> 03:19:41.202
PROPOSAL WELL PRESUMABLY THE

03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:42.437
INSTITUTIONS HAVE THAT HEY THAT

03:19:42.503 --> 03:19:43.638
AND PROVIDE REPORTS.

03:19:43.705 --> 03:19:44.706
THAT'S CORRECT INTERNALLY THE

03:19:44.772 --> 03:19:46.107
QUESTION IS YOU JUST DON'T GET

03:19:46.174 --> 03:19:48.176
THE REPORT THAT'S CORRECT AND

03:19:48.242 --> 03:19:49.544
AGAIN THAT'S NOT AT ALL DUE TO

03:19:49.610 --> 03:19:50.878
ANY SORT OF MALFEASANCE ON THE

03:19:50.945 --> 03:19:52.380
INSTITUTIONS PART IS JUST DUE TO

03:19:52.447 --> 03:19:53.781
THE FACT THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN.

03:19:53.848 --> 03:19:54.782
PART OF THE PROCESS OR THE

03:19:54.849 --> 03:19:57.785
SYSTEM UNTIL NOW WE DO OBVIOUSLY

03:19:57.852 --> 03:20:00.588
ENGAGE ON A ON A ONE TO ONE SORT

03:20:00.655 --> 03:20:02.390
OF CASE BY CASE BASIS WITH

03:20:02.457 --> 03:20:04.125
INSTITUTIONS AND SEGMENTS WE

03:20:04.192 --> 03:20:05.293
HAVE MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING

03:20:05.360 --> 03:20:06.260
WITH -- ALL

03:20:06.327 --> 03:20:07.395
OF THE SEGMENTS HERE AT THE

03:20:07.462 --> 03:20:09.097
TABLE TODAY AND THE CALIFORNIA

03:20:09.163 --> 03:20:10.498
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO GET

03:20:10.565 --> 03:20:12.500
VARIOUS DATA BUT I THINK ONE OF

03:20:12.567 --> 03:20:14.168
THE THINGS THAT WE'RE INTERESTED

03:20:14.235 --> 03:20:15.603
IN POLICY WISE IS.

03:20:15.670 --> 03:20:17.872
COULD A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM

03:20:17.939 --> 03:20:20.875
OR SOME SORT SORT OF STATUTORY

03:20:20.942 --> 03:20:22.310
EXPECTATION OF THE LEGISLATURE

03:20:22.377 --> 03:20:24.145
HELP AUTOMATE SOME OF THOSE

03:20:24.212 --> 03:20:25.947
PROCESS SEES SO THAT WHEN WE GET

03:20:26.013 --> 03:20:28.883
ASKED FROM LEGISLATORS OR

03:20:28.950 --> 03:20:30.151
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC OR THE

03:20:30.218 --> 03:20:31.519
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RESEARCHERS

03:20:31.586 --> 03:20:32.653
WHOEVER IT IS.

03:20:32.720 --> 03:20:34.622
HEY HOW IS A HOUSE THE CAL GRANT

03:20:34.689 --> 03:20:36.124
PROGRAM AFFECTING.

03:20:36.190 --> 03:20:38.793
THE THE MOVE TO INCREASE THE

03:20:38.860 --> 03:20:43.831
FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE AT CSU --

03:20:43.898 --> 03:20:46.901
I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY BE WE

03:20:46.968 --> 03:20:48.102
DON'T HAVE TO REACH OUT TO MEET

03:20:48.169 --> 03:20:48.870
THEM AND NOT A CONCERN AS WELL

03:20:48.936 --> 03:20:50.571
AND SAY LET'S SET UP A FORMAL

03:20:50.638 --> 03:20:52.240
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING.

03:20:52.306 --> 03:20:52.940
AND HAVE ALL THE ATTORNEYS GO

03:20:53.007 --> 03:20:55.610
OVER AT AND CHECK ALL THE BOXES

03:20:55.676 --> 03:20:56.544
THE WE CAN COLLECT THIS DATA AND

03:20:56.611 --> 03:20:58.045
THEN YOU KNOW SEVERAL MONTHS OR

03:20:58.112 --> 03:20:59.280
WHO KNOWS MAYBE EVEN YEARS LATER

03:20:59.347 --> 03:21:00.948
WE'LL BE ABLE TO REPORT BACK.

03:21:01.015 --> 03:21:02.850
ON THAT METRIC I THINK THAT

03:21:02.917 --> 03:21:04.352
HAVING A SYSTEMOR A POLICY IN

03:21:04.419 --> 03:21:05.019
PLACE --

03:21:05.086 --> 03:21:08.456
ALONG THESE LINES COULD.

03:21:08.523 --> 03:21:09.624
REALLY AUTOMATE THAT AND ENABLE

03:21:09.690 --> 03:21:12.326
US TO PERFORM OUR FIDUCIARY

03:21:12.393 --> 03:21:14.061
RESPONSIBILITY AS STEWARDS OF

03:21:14.128 --> 03:21:15.363
OVER TWO AND A HALF BILLION

03:21:15.430 --> 03:21:17.165
DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER FUNDS. TO

03:21:17.231 --> 03:21:19.033
REPORT ON HOW THOSE PROGRAMS ARE

03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:21.302
OR AREN'T WORKING OR COULD OR

03:21:21.369 --> 03:21:22.770
COULD NOT BE IMPROVED SO.

03:21:22.837 --> 03:21:24.472
WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT YOU ALL

03:21:24.539 --> 03:21:25.840
SEE YOU?

03:21:25.907 --> 03:21:26.507
WITH REGARD TO THE

03:21:26.574 --> 03:21:28.342
IMPLEMENTATION OF A LONGITUDINAL

03:21:28.409 --> 03:21:29.811
DATA SYSTEM SOMEWHERE IN HERE

03:21:29.877 --> 03:21:31.979
HERE I WAS READING ABOUT STUDENT

03:21:32.046 --> 03:21:32.814
IDENTIFICATION.

03:21:32.880 --> 03:21:33.915
OF NUMBERS --

03:21:33.981 --> 03:21:36.851
VERSUS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS

03:21:36.918 --> 03:21:38.085
AND HOW ALL THAT WORKS --

03:21:38.152 --> 03:21:39.387
SUMMER REQUIRED SOMEWHERE

03:21:39.454 --> 03:21:42.590
REQUIRED IN.

03:21:42.657 --> 03:21:44.325
SUMMER VOLUNTARY AND IF YOU

03:21:44.392 --> 03:21:45.927
START AT THE VERY BEGINNING YOUR

03:21:45.993 --> 03:21:47.929
QUESTION ABOUT GEOMETRY WE CAN'T

03:21:47.995 --> 03:21:49.964
EVEN TELL YOU WHAT OPPORTUNITIES

03:21:50.031 --> 03:21:51.599
CHILDREN ENGAGED IN BEFORE THEY

03:21:51.666 --> 03:21:52.800
ENTERED KINDERGARTEN.

03:21:52.867 --> 03:21:53.901
THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE

03:21:53.968 --> 03:21:55.670
SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR THIRD GRADE

03:21:55.736 --> 03:21:57.004
SCORES THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO

03:21:57.071 --> 03:21:58.506
MOVE THROUGH THEIR COURSE WORK

03:21:58.573 --> 03:22:00.141
AND ACTUALLY TAKE THAT AND THEN

03:22:00.208 --> 03:22:02.343
BE SUCCESSFUL IN EITHER A CAREER.

03:22:02.410 --> 03:22:03.978
THAT'S VIABLE OR IN COLLEGE

03:22:04.045 --> 03:22:05.246
RIGHT NOW SO.

03:22:05.313 --> 03:22:07.248
IF YOU GO BACK MAP IT AND LOOK

03:22:07.315 --> 03:22:09.283
AT EQUITY THERE IS ACTUALLY AN

03:22:09.350 --> 03:22:10.318
OPPORTUNITY GAP SO HOW WE'RE

03:22:10.384 --> 03:22:11.953
CAPTURING THOSE EARLY LEARNING

03:22:12.019 --> 03:22:13.488
YEARS AND NOT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT

03:22:13.554 --> 03:22:14.822
THAT WE KNOW HAPPENS.

03:22:14.889 --> 03:22:16.457
THERE'S RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THE

03:22:16.524 --> 03:22:18.993
IMPACT OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN

03:22:19.060 --> 03:22:20.261
MONTHS AROUND OPPORTUNITIES THAT

03:22:20.328 --> 03:22:23.231
IS ACTUALLY DIRECTLY AFFECTING

03:22:23.297 --> 03:22:24.932
THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

03:22:24.999 --> 03:22:25.833
SO THE MORE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

03:22:25.900 --> 03:22:26.767
WHAT WHAT COLLEGE READINESS

03:22:26.834 --> 03:22:28.603
MEANS BEING ABLE TO GO BACK AND

03:22:28.669 --> 03:22:30.104
SAY WHERE WHERE THOSE CHILDREN

03:22:30.171 --> 03:22:31.539
FOR EARLY LEARNING EXPERIENCES

03:22:31.606 --> 03:22:33.040
WHAT QUALITY LEVELS FOR THOSE

03:22:33.107 --> 03:22:34.675
EXPERIENCES AND THEN HOW DO WE

03:22:34.742 --> 03:22:35.376
REALLY.

03:22:35.443 --> 03:22:37.478
INVEST IN THOSE COMPONENTS OF IT

03:22:37.545 --> 03:22:38.746
WHICH WHICH WE THEN SEE HELP

03:22:38.813 --> 03:22:40.047
PROMOTE THOSE THIRD GRADE

03:22:40.114 --> 03:22:41.315
READING SCORES IN MATH SCORES

03:22:41.382 --> 03:22:43.017
WHICH AND PROMOTE THEIR ABILITY

03:22:43.084 --> 03:22:44.585
TO APPLY TO COLLEGE.

03:22:44.652 --> 03:22:46.354
AND BE SUCCESSFUL SO IT STARTS

03:22:46.420 --> 03:22:49.557
IN AS WE SAY WITH OUT THAT

03:22:49.624 --> 03:22:50.691
CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY WON'T BE

03:22:50.758 --> 03:22:52.493
ABLE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS THAT

03:22:52.560 --> 03:22:53.628
HELP THEM CREATE THAT VERY

03:22:53.694 --> 03:22:55.663
COMPETITIVE INTERNATIONAL

03:22:55.730 --> 03:22:55.963
WORKFORCE.

03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:57.498
SO IS THE ISSUE PUTTING A MARKER

03:22:57.565 --> 03:23:00.268
ON THESE YOUNG PEOPLE A NUMBER

03:23:00.334 --> 03:23:00.902
OR SOMETHING HOW TO HOW DO WE DO

03:23:00.968 --> 03:23:02.670
THIS.

03:23:02.737 --> 03:23:04.171
HAVING THAT A UNIQUE ID IS

03:23:04.238 --> 03:23:05.439
OBVIOUSLY A BIG PIECE OF IT

03:23:05.506 --> 03:23:06.941
HAVING A STRONGER DATA SYSTEM

03:23:07.008 --> 03:23:08.242
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT THE

03:23:08.309 --> 03:23:10.678
UNIQUE ID INTO AS A COMPONENT OF

03:23:10.745 --> 03:23:10.845
IT.

03:23:10.912 --> 03:23:12.246
AND DINE OUT MY COLLEAGUE OVER

03:23:12.313 --> 03:23:13.781
HERE ALSO MENTIONED --

03:23:13.848 --> 03:23:14.715
THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER

03:23:14.782 --> 03:23:15.850
SERVICES SO A LOT OF THE

03:23:15.917 --> 03:23:16.684
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT ARE

03:23:16.751 --> 03:23:18.085
IN OUR PROGRAMS ALSO HAVE

03:23:18.152 --> 03:23:19.520
SNAPPED THERE ARE ALSO ENGAGED

03:23:19.587 --> 03:23:21.088
IN OTHERS TO NOT ONLY OUR

03:23:21.155 --> 03:23:22.423
FAMILIES HAVING TO APPLY.

03:23:22.490 --> 03:23:23.991
MULTIPLE TIMES TO DETERMINE

03:23:24.058 --> 03:23:26.060
ELIGIBILITY WE THEN AREN'T ABLE

03:23:26.127 --> 03:23:28.829
TO CONNECT THOSE FAMILIES ACROSS

03:23:28.896 --> 03:23:29.664
THE SERVICES.

03:23:29.730 --> 03:23:30.698
SO IF THEY WERE IN A HOME

03:23:30.765 --> 03:23:32.233
VISITING PROGRAM IF THEY HAD A

03:23:32.300 --> 03:23:33.868
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING THOSE

03:23:33.935 --> 03:23:35.670
THINGS DON'T CONNECT ACROSS FUND

03:23:35.736 --> 03:23:37.738
TO ACTUALLY CREATE A PICTURE OF

03:23:37.805 --> 03:23:38.973
THE WHOLE CHILD.

03:23:39.040 --> 03:23:40.041
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT

03:23:40.107 --> 03:23:41.842
CHILD'S LIFE SO WE CAN DETERMINE

03:23:41.909 --> 03:23:43.277
WHERE TO MAKE BETTER INVESTMENTS

03:23:43.344 --> 03:23:45.313
WE INVEST A LOT OF MONEY.

03:23:45.379 --> 03:23:46.614
BUT HOW WELL DO WE INVEST IT

03:23:46.681 --> 03:23:48.082
THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU INTO WE

03:23:48.149 --> 03:23:50.885
HAVE SOME OF THE BETTER DATA TO

03:23:50.952 --> 03:23:52.253
BE ABLE TO LINK CAN SORT OF

03:23:52.320 --> 03:23:53.120
CARRY THROUGH IN A LONGITUDINAL

03:23:53.187 --> 03:23:53.321
WAY.

03:23:53.387 --> 03:23:54.722
WHAT POINT IS A UNIQUE

03:23:54.789 --> 03:23:55.957
IDENTIFIER ASSIGNED TO A

03:23:56.023 --> 03:23:58.492
PARTICULAR STUDENTS AND AND HOW

03:23:58.559 --> 03:24:02.597
FAR IN THIS IT ALONG THE SYSTEM

03:24:02.663 --> 03:24:03.130
DOES IT?

03:24:03.197 --> 03:24:04.265
CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE STUDENTS

03:24:04.332 --> 03:24:05.499
BEFORE WE SHIFT TO A SOCIAL

03:24:05.566 --> 03:24:07.435
SECURITY NUMBER IF IF AT ALL SO

03:24:07.501 --> 03:24:09.203
AND WHEN CENTER CAN A GARDEN OUR

03:24:09.270 --> 03:24:11.172
PRE K. IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL

03:24:11.238 --> 03:24:12.473
SYSTEM THEY ARE ASSIGNED TO

03:24:12.540 --> 03:24:14.208
STUDENT IDENTIFIER.

03:24:14.275 --> 03:24:15.009
AND IT'S AN IDENTIFIER CARRIES

03:24:15.076 --> 03:24:16.143
ITH THEM AS LONG AS THEY'RE IN

03:24:16.210 --> 03:24:18.045
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AT THE

03:24:18.112 --> 03:24:19.981
K. TWELVE SEGMENT MODEL WE'VE.

03:24:20.047 --> 03:24:21.549
ALSO ARE GOING TO BE BEGIN

03:24:21.616 --> 03:24:22.883
COLLECTING AS THEY RELATED HARD

03:24:22.950 --> 03:24:23.517
TOLD --

03:24:23.584 --> 03:24:25.052
EDUCATION STUDENTS THROUGH THAT

03:24:25.119 --> 03:24:28.522
SAME IDENTIFIER --

03:24:28.589 --> 03:24:31.392
IN IN THIS NEXT SUMMER THOSE FOR

03:24:31.459 --> 03:24:33.294
COLLECTING DATA ON OUR SIX POINT

03:24:33.361 --> 03:24:35.029
TWO MILLION KIDS THREE MILLION

03:24:35.096 --> 03:24:35.529
KIDS --

03:24:35.596 --> 03:24:37.231
EVERY YEAR WE KNOW A LOT OF

03:24:37.298 --> 03:24:38.432
INFORMATION ABOUT THEM BECAUSE

03:24:38.499 --> 03:24:39.667
OF THAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT

03:24:39.734 --> 03:24:40.868
BUT WE ALSO ARE ABLE TO MATCH

03:24:40.935 --> 03:24:42.503
THAT DATA.

03:24:42.570 --> 03:24:43.604
NOT USING THE STEPS TO IDENTIFY

03:24:43.671 --> 03:24:45.072
BUT USING THINGS LIKE NAME AND

03:24:45.139 --> 03:24:46.774
AND BIRTH DATE WITH --

03:24:46.841 --> 03:24:48.342
AGENCIES --

03:24:48.409 --> 03:24:49.243
SUCH AS DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

03:24:49.310 --> 03:24:50.645
SERVICES WE KNOW WHO ARE

03:24:50.711 --> 03:24:52.279
CONSIDERED FOSTER YOUTH UNDER

03:24:52.346 --> 03:24:53.547
THEIR AUSPICES.

03:24:53.614 --> 03:24:54.849
SAME THING WITH DEPARTMENT OF

03:24:54.915 --> 03:24:56.450
HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO

03:24:56.517 --> 03:24:58.552
DETERMINE FREE AN ELIGIBLE FREE

03:24:58.619 --> 03:24:59.153
ENTERPRISE ELIGIBLE MALES SO

03:24:59.220 --> 03:25:00.521
STUDENTS DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK

03:25:00.588 --> 03:25:01.756
AGAIN AND TELL US OR HAVE A

03:25:01.822 --> 03:25:03.024
PARENT FILL OUT AN APPLICATION

03:25:03.090 --> 03:25:05.393
WE ALREADY DIRECT CERTIFY THEM.

03:25:05.459 --> 03:25:06.560
AND THEN ANOTHER --

03:25:06.627 --> 03:25:08.062
PIECE OF WHICH WE DO DIRECTOR OF

03:25:08.129 --> 03:25:08.929
CASE WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT

03:25:08.996 --> 03:25:10.665
THIS AT THIS AGENCY AT ALL BUT

03:25:10.731 --> 03:25:11.899
TEACHER CREDENTIALING COMMISSION

03:25:11.966 --> 03:25:13.434
WE ACTUALLY KNOW MORE ABOUT

03:25:13.501 --> 03:25:14.835
WHERE OUR TEACHERS ARE TEACHING

03:25:14.902 --> 03:25:16.404
BECAUSE WE'RE COLLECTING THAT

03:25:16.470 --> 03:25:17.772
DATA WERE AS A COMMISSION ON

03:25:17.838 --> 03:25:18.305
TEACHER CREDENTIALING IS

03:25:18.372 --> 03:25:20.007
COLLECTED ABOUT THEIR CREDENTIAL.

03:25:20.074 --> 03:25:21.509
SO WE HAVE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

03:25:21.575 --> 03:25:22.476
ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH

03:25:22.543 --> 03:25:23.577
OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS

03:25:23.644 --> 03:25:25.012
THAT ARE TRAINED AS TEACHERS AND

03:25:25.079 --> 03:25:26.681
GIVING THEM BACK INFORMATION

03:25:26.747 --> 03:25:29.050
BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT DATA VERSUS --

03:25:29.116 --> 03:25:30.284
AND AGENCIES A TO THE TEACHER

03:25:30.351 --> 03:25:35.089
CREDENTIALING COMMISSION ONCE

03:25:35.156 --> 03:25:36.691
YOU ONCE YOU.

03:25:36.757 --> 03:25:39.093
COLLATOR COMPILED THE DATA.

03:25:39.160 --> 03:25:40.561
USING NAMES AND BIRTHDATES

03:25:40.628 --> 03:25:42.663
BECAUSE THESE OTHER AGENCIES

03:25:42.730 --> 03:25:44.999
DON'T HAVE A STUDENT IDENTITY.

03:25:45.066 --> 03:25:45.466
THE APPLICATION NUMBER

03:25:45.533 --> 03:25:45.766
ASSOCIATED.

03:25:45.833 --> 03:25:47.702
IT'S IN YOUR SYSTEM.

03:25:47.768 --> 03:25:48.536
VISIT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

03:25:48.602 --> 03:25:51.172
THEN HAVE ACCESS THROUGH THIS DO

03:25:51.238 --> 03:25:52.940
NOT IDENTIFIER. TO THAT DATA

03:25:53.007 --> 03:25:53.708
CENTRE SO WE ENTERED INTO AN

03:25:53.774 --> 03:25:54.308
AGREEMENT WITH THAT COMMITTEE

03:25:54.375 --> 03:25:54.875
COLLEGES ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO

03:25:54.942 --> 03:25:56.544
THAT AS STUDENTS ARE APPLYING TO

03:25:56.610 --> 03:25:57.812
THE COMMUNICATIVE.

03:25:57.878 --> 03:25:58.646
THEY ARE --

03:25:58.713 --> 03:26:00.214
PINYIN AGAINST OUR DATABASE TO

03:26:00.281 --> 03:26:01.482
ENSURE THAT THE THE NUMBER THAT

03:26:01.549 --> 03:26:02.783
THEY ARE IN PUTTING ISN'T IS IS

03:26:02.850 --> 03:26:04.118
THE ACCURATE --

03:26:04.185 --> 03:26:05.286
NUMBER WE HAVE AT HAD

03:26:05.352 --> 03:26:06.620
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OTHER

03:26:06.687 --> 03:26:08.756
SEGMENTS ABOUT THAT --

03:26:08.823 --> 03:26:09.390
BUT BUT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THAT

03:26:09.457 --> 03:26:12.860
YOU LEVEL AND THEY WERE ABLE TO

03:26:12.927 --> 03:26:14.128
ADD IT TO THEIR APPLICATION THE

03:26:14.195 --> 03:26:15.763
COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAS BEEN

03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:17.098
RECEIVING THAT DATA --

03:26:17.164 --> 03:26:18.799
FROM FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:26:18.866 --> 03:26:21.869
EDUCATION I JUST DID THIS TO ADD

03:26:21.936 --> 03:26:23.437
TO CITIES OUT OF WITH A SECURITY

03:26:23.504 --> 03:26:25.106
NUMBERS OF THE K. TWELVE DOES

03:26:25.172 --> 03:26:26.273
NOT COLLECT SO SECURITY NUMBERS

03:26:26.340 --> 03:26:27.875
WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS WAGE

03:26:27.942 --> 03:26:29.276
DATA AS A RESULT OF THAT.

03:26:29.343 --> 03:26:30.745
SO WE ARE EXPLORING --

03:26:30.811 --> 03:26:32.179
THROUGH A A AND REMOTE WITH THE

03:26:32.246 --> 03:26:33.547
COMMUNICABLE EDGES ON HOW TO

03:26:33.614 --> 03:26:34.949
ACCESS WAGE DATA.

03:26:35.015 --> 03:26:36.550
VIA AN AGREEMENT WITH THEM

03:26:36.617 --> 03:26:38.152
BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHERE THEIR

03:26:38.219 --> 03:26:39.954
STUDENTS THEY'RE ABLE TO OBTAIN

03:26:40.020 --> 03:26:40.955
NATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO

03:26:41.021 --> 03:26:42.356
SECURITY NUMBERS BUT BECAUSE

03:26:42.423 --> 03:26:43.657
BAUER-KAHAN DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS

03:26:43.724 --> 03:26:45.059
TO THAT INFORMATION.

03:26:45.126 --> 03:26:45.993
THERE IS --

03:26:46.060 --> 03:26:46.894
AVOID -- FOR

03:26:46.961 --> 03:26:48.095
K. TWELVE STUDENT POPULATION

03:26:48.162 --> 03:26:49.663
WHETHER NOT THEY IF THEY WENT TO

03:26:49.730 --> 03:26:51.699
COLLEGE AGAIN WE CAN GRAB IT

03:26:51.766 --> 03:26:52.900
FROM SOMEBODY LIKE COMMUNITY

03:26:52.967 --> 03:26:54.268
COLLEGES IF THEY DO NOT GO TO

03:26:54.335 --> 03:26:54.969
COLLEGE AND GO STRAIGHT INTO THE

03:26:55.035 --> 03:26:58.739
WORK FORCE.

03:26:58.806 --> 03:27:00.908
WE DO NOT HAVE INFORMATION.

03:27:00.975 --> 03:27:01.475
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE

03:27:01.542 --> 03:27:02.009
ASKING THE RIGHT KINDS OF

03:27:02.076 --> 03:27:03.077
QUESTIONS BECAUSE THIS WAY TO

03:27:03.144 --> 03:27:04.612
INTEGRATE INFORMATION IS REALLY

03:27:04.678 --> 03:27:06.380
CRITICAL FOR THE DATA THAT WE

03:27:06.447 --> 03:27:07.648
END UP HAVING WE DO COLLECT

03:27:07.715 --> 03:27:09.350
INFORMATION ABOUT THE THE

03:27:09.416 --> 03:27:11.218
STUDENT ID THAT COMES IN ITSELF

03:27:11.285 --> 03:27:13.053
REPORTED AND I CAN EASILY MAKE A

03:27:13.120 --> 03:27:14.255
TYPO WITH.

03:27:14.321 --> 03:27:15.623
WITH WHAT I INPUT --

03:27:15.689 --> 03:27:16.991
SO WE TEND NOT TO USE IT BECAUSE

03:27:17.057 --> 03:27:18.159
WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO VALIDATE

03:27:18.225 --> 03:27:19.894
WHETHER WHAT IS STUDENT PUTS IN

03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:21.395
IS AN ACCURATE IDEA.

03:27:21.462 --> 03:27:23.164
ABOUT WE USE --

03:27:23.230 --> 03:27:25.566
SEVERAL OF THE MEANS TO DO IT --

03:27:25.633 --> 03:27:27.201
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER BECAUSE

03:27:27.268 --> 03:27:28.502
OF THE PRIVACY THINGS WITH IT

03:27:28.569 --> 03:27:31.038
BUT WHEN WE GET DATA FROM ET DE

03:27:31.105 --> 03:27:32.540
IT IS A KEY SOURCE.

03:27:32.606 --> 03:27:35.075
AND WE USE ALL OUR PRIVACY MEANS

03:27:35.142 --> 03:27:37.178
TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT --

03:27:37.244 --> 03:27:38.479
WE ACCESS DATA THROUGH OTHER

03:27:38.546 --> 03:27:39.680
SOURCES LIKE THE NATIONAL

03:27:39.747 --> 03:27:40.915
STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE WHICH

03:27:40.981 --> 03:27:42.249
GIVES US INFORMATION ABOUT

03:27:42.316 --> 03:27:43.117
WHETHER OR NOT.

03:27:43.184 --> 03:27:44.185
STUDENTS ATTEND OTHER

03:27:44.251 --> 03:27:45.719
INSTITUTIONS WHETHER OUR

03:27:45.786 --> 03:27:47.354
UNDERGRADUATES GOING TO GRADUATE

03:27:47.421 --> 03:27:49.557
SCHOOL WITH THAT WE USE AT WHAT

03:27:49.623 --> 03:27:51.625
WE CALL IN TECHNICAL TERMS A

03:27:51.692 --> 03:27:52.760
FUZZY MATCH --

03:27:52.827 --> 03:27:54.094
AND THAT IS --

03:27:54.161 --> 03:27:56.530
A LOT OF THE INFORMATION AND

03:27:56.597 --> 03:27:57.464
THAT MY COLLEAGUE OVER HERE'S

03:27:57.531 --> 03:27:59.567
MENTIONED NAME BIRTHDATE AND

03:27:59.633 --> 03:28:01.602
OTHER INDICATORS WE GET A VERY

03:28:01.669 --> 03:28:03.504
GOOD MATCH WITH THAT KIND OF

03:28:03.571 --> 03:28:04.672
PROCESS --

03:28:04.738 --> 03:28:06.440
I'M SURPRISED ABOUT HOW GOOD IT

03:28:06.507 --> 03:28:07.541
IS -- BUT

03:28:07.608 --> 03:28:09.109
THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS

03:28:09.176 --> 03:28:11.145
TO COLLECT IT BUT HAVING A MEANS

03:28:11.212 --> 03:28:12.146
TO BE ABLE TO DO IT I CAN

03:28:12.213 --> 03:28:14.248
IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE

03:28:14.315 --> 03:28:16.150
ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION.

03:28:16.217 --> 03:28:18.018
WITHOUT THAT A KEY WAY FOR THE

03:28:18.085 --> 03:28:20.020
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IS

03:28:20.087 --> 03:28:21.388
TRICKY SO WELL ONE MORE BENEFIT

03:28:21.455 --> 03:28:23.157
I GUESS OF AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM

03:28:23.224 --> 03:28:24.291
IS.

03:28:24.358 --> 03:28:28.329
YOU COULD IN FACT GO TO CD AND

03:28:28.395 --> 03:28:32.867
AND VALIDATE MY VERIFY THE

03:28:32.933 --> 03:28:34.268
STUDENT AID.

03:28:34.335 --> 03:28:34.835
UNIQUE STUDENT IDENTIFIER.

03:28:34.902 --> 03:28:36.971
AND THEN HAVE ACCESS TO THE C.

03:28:37.037 --> 03:28:38.639
D. BODY OF INFORMATION REGARDING

03:28:38.706 --> 03:28:39.273
OUR STUDENTS AND AND THERE IS AN

03:28:39.340 --> 03:28:40.441
EXCELLENT EXAMPLE --

03:28:40.507 --> 03:28:41.242
IN THE WRITE UP OF THE

03:28:41.308 --> 03:28:42.810
CALIFORNIA COLLEGE GUIDANCE

03:28:42.877 --> 03:28:44.778
INITIATIVE WHICH THERE ARE

03:28:44.845 --> 03:28:46.947
DISTRICTS IN THE STATE THAT ARE

03:28:47.014 --> 03:28:49.049
THAT PROGRAM WHICH IS

03:28:49.116 --> 03:28:50.451
EFFECTIVELY ALLOWING.

03:28:50.517 --> 03:28:51.785
IT IS INTEGRATED WITH THE

03:28:51.852 --> 03:28:53.287
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SEE

03:28:53.354 --> 03:28:54.622
ISSUES APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION

03:28:54.688 --> 03:28:56.724
SO THAT STUDENTS ACADEMIC RECORD

03:28:56.790 --> 03:28:58.559
AND THEIR SSID ERROR STUDENT

03:28:58.626 --> 03:29:01.262
IDENTIFIER ISSUED BY CD COMES TO

03:29:01.328 --> 03:29:02.630
US ELECTRONICALLY THE STUDENT

03:29:02.696 --> 03:29:03.898
DOESN'T HAVE.

03:29:03.964 --> 03:29:05.332
TO MANUALLY KEY THAT --

03:29:05.399 --> 03:29:07.835
SO THOSE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES

03:29:07.902 --> 03:29:09.770
I THINK ALSO --

03:29:09.837 --> 03:29:11.906
A FORTNIGHT A HUGE AMOUNT OF OF

03:29:11.972 --> 03:29:14.008
PROMISE AS WERE TALKING AT RIGHT

03:29:14.074 --> 03:29:15.676
NOW THAT'S ONLY ABOUT 15% OF OUR

03:29:15.743 --> 03:29:17.778
APPLICANTS ARE SUBMITTING FROM

03:29:17.845 --> 03:29:18.445
DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THAT

03:29:18.512 --> 03:29:20.881
INTEGRATED OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW --

03:29:20.948 --> 03:29:22.983
BECAUSE THAT ALSO VALIDATES THE

03:29:23.050 --> 03:29:24.451
DATA IT'S THE DATE OUR CAMPUSES

03:29:24.518 --> 03:29:25.653
ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT

03:29:25.719 --> 03:29:26.987
WHETHER BE ADMISSION PLACEMENT

03:29:27.054 --> 03:29:28.122
ALL THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WERE

03:29:28.188 --> 03:29:30.257
WE'RE DEPENDING ON THE THE

03:29:30.324 --> 03:29:31.892
QUALITY OF THATDATA AS IT'S

03:29:31.959 --> 03:29:32.960
COMING FROM OUR K. TWELVE

03:29:33.027 --> 03:29:34.061
PARTNERS --

03:29:34.128 --> 03:29:35.396
VERSES MUCH OF THE INFORMATION

03:29:35.462 --> 03:29:36.597
THAT SET THE STUDENT PROVIDE

03:29:36.664 --> 03:29:37.932
THAT THE POINT OF APPLICATION

03:29:37.998 --> 03:29:39.033
ITSELF REPORTED --

03:29:39.099 --> 03:29:41.502
SO THAT'S ALSO A REALITY OF OF

03:29:41.568 --> 03:29:43.237
STRONGER INTEGRATION NOT JUST

03:29:43.304 --> 03:29:44.371
FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS HAT

03:29:44.438 --> 03:29:45.673
WE'RE DISCUSSING.

03:29:45.739 --> 03:29:46.807
BUT REALLY ALL SERVE TO THE

03:29:46.874 --> 03:29:48.008
BENEFIT OF STUDENTS AS THEY'RE

03:29:48.075 --> 03:29:49.643
MOVING THROUGH ALL OF OUR ARE

03:29:49.710 --> 03:29:50.744
DIFFERENT --

03:29:50.811 --> 03:29:52.246
ARE IFFERENT SEGMENTS OFTEN

03:29:52.313 --> 03:29:53.781
SIMULTANEOUSLY AS AS BEEN

03:29:53.847 --> 03:29:55.950
TALKED ABOUT SO THERE ARE SOME

03:29:56.016 --> 03:29:57.217
PROMISING EXAMPLE CCJ BEING ONE

03:29:57.284 --> 03:29:59.086
OF THOSE WHERE WE WE'VE ALREADY

03:29:59.153 --> 03:30:00.454
MADE THAT CONNECTION IT'S NOT

03:30:00.521 --> 03:30:02.056
EVEN A MATTER OF VALIDATING IT'S

03:30:02.122 --> 03:30:03.590
REALLY COMING WITH THE STUDENTS

03:30:03.657 --> 03:30:03.958
RECORD.

03:30:04.024 --> 03:30:05.159
AND THEN WHAT WE'VE DONE SOME

03:30:05.225 --> 03:30:09.863
SIMILAR THINGS WITH THIS DO NAY

03:30:09.930 --> 03:30:12.132
COMMISSION AS WELL.

03:30:12.199 --> 03:30:13.133
YOU ASKED ABOUT CHALLENGES SO

03:30:13.200 --> 03:30:15.469
JUST WANTED TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT --

03:30:15.536 --> 03:30:16.070
THREE YOU KNOW I THINK SETTING

03:30:16.136 --> 03:30:16.737
UP THE RULES ABOUT WHO USES THAT

03:30:16.804 --> 03:30:18.172
FOR WHAT PURPOSES THE DIFFERENT

03:30:18.238 --> 03:30:20.107
TYPES OF ACCESS FOLKS HAVE TO

03:30:20.174 --> 03:30:21.742
THE DATE I THINK IS IMPORTANT --

03:30:21.809 --> 03:30:22.376
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S

03:30:22.443 --> 03:30:23.844
IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT'S CERTAINLY

03:30:23.911 --> 03:30:25.546
CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE IT'S

03:30:25.612 --> 03:30:28.015
IMPOSSIBLE BUT TAKE WORK --

03:30:28.082 --> 03:30:28.582
YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE

03:30:28.649 --> 03:30:31.185
THINGS PAUSES FROM OUR

03:30:31.251 --> 03:30:32.519
PERSPECTIVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES

03:30:32.586 --> 03:30:33.620
AND TIME.

03:30:33.687 --> 03:30:35.956
IS VARYING INTERPRETATIONS OF

03:30:36.023 --> 03:30:37.591
STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS

03:30:37.658 --> 03:30:38.726
AND I AM NOT --

03:30:38.792 --> 03:30:41.628
AGENCIES COUNCIL BUT MY SENSE IS

03:30:41.695 --> 03:30:43.097
OUR COUNCIL SPENDS A LOT OF TIME

03:30:43.163 --> 03:30:44.865
WITH OTHER ATTORNEYS FROM OTHER

03:30:44.932 --> 03:30:47.401
AGENCIES WORKING THROUGH IT --

03:30:47.468 --> 03:30:48.602
YOU KNOW IN MANY CASES DIFFERENT

03:30:48.669 --> 03:30:51.271
INTERPRETATIONS OF OF THESE LAWS

03:30:51.338 --> 03:30:53.173
AND SO I THINK --

03:30:53.240 --> 03:30:54.942
THAT IS BEEN A BARRIER.

03:30:55.009 --> 03:30:56.176
AND I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW I

03:30:56.243 --> 03:30:56.643
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:57.945
UNDERESTIMATE KIND OF KNOW OUR

03:30:58.012 --> 03:31:01.482
METHOD IS PRODUCING AMMO USE.

03:31:01.548 --> 03:31:02.249
ROGER BUT PROJECT OR ENTITY BY

03:31:02.316 --> 03:31:05.019
ENTITY THAT IS WORKLOAD --

03:31:05.085 --> 03:31:06.286
AND WE MANAGE IT BY WE GET

03:31:06.353 --> 03:31:08.222
REQUESTS WE HAVE A SET OF

03:31:08.288 --> 03:31:09.690
PRIORITIES THAT --

03:31:09.757 --> 03:31:11.058
YOU KNOW TODAY ARE LINKED TO OUR

03:31:11.125 --> 03:31:12.693
VISION FOR SUCCESS SO WE LOOK AT

03:31:12.760 --> 03:31:14.895
A REQUESTED WE SAY YOU KNOW IT'S

03:31:14.962 --> 03:31:15.462
GOING.

03:31:15.529 --> 03:31:16.964
TO A YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE

03:31:17.031 --> 03:31:18.132
REQUESTS TOGETHER WILL REQUIRE

03:31:18.198 --> 03:31:20.067
MORE OF OUR TIME THAT WE CAN PUT

03:31:20.134 --> 03:31:21.969
TO THIS SO WHICH OF THESE DATA

03:31:22.036 --> 03:31:24.905
REQUEST BEST SUPPORTS THE VISION

03:31:24.972 --> 03:31:26.407
FOR SUCCESS --

03:31:26.473 --> 03:31:27.007
THAT MAY NOT BE THE OTHER YOU

03:31:27.074 --> 03:31:28.575
KNOW THE OTHER AGENCY MAY COME

03:31:28.642 --> 03:31:30.310
TO THE CONVERSATION WITH A

03:31:30.377 --> 03:31:31.779
DIFFERENT SET OF PRIORITIES.

03:31:31.845 --> 03:31:33.781
AND IF IT DOESN'T --

03:31:33.847 --> 03:31:34.848
IF IT DOESN'T ALIGN WITH OUR

03:31:34.915 --> 03:31:36.350
VISION FOR SUCCESS IT MAKES IT

03:31:36.417 --> 03:31:37.851
HARDER FOR US TO JUSTIFY

03:31:37.918 --> 03:31:40.154
PRIORITIZING THAT AGENCIES

03:31:40.220 --> 03:31:40.387
EDITOR.

03:31:40.454 --> 03:31:41.555
AND OF COURSE THAT'S A THAT'S A

03:31:41.622 --> 03:31:44.091
PROBLEM OR AN ISSUE THAT.

03:31:44.158 --> 03:31:47.261
IS ASSOCIATED WITH STOVE PIPE.

03:31:47.327 --> 03:31:47.995
TO OPERATIONS RIGHT I MEAN SO

03:31:48.062 --> 03:31:49.930
THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION ONE

03:31:49.997 --> 03:31:51.298
OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT LIKE

03:31:51.365 --> 03:31:52.466
FOR YOU TO TALK TO ME ABOUT AND

03:31:52.533 --> 03:31:55.702
PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANTLY TO THE

03:31:55.769 --> 03:31:56.303
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

03:31:56.370 --> 03:31:56.603
[inaudible]

03:31:56.670 --> 03:31:59.406
IS A IN THIS PROCESS.

03:31:59.473 --> 03:32:00.941
IN LOOKING AT THE DESIGN AND

03:32:01.008 --> 03:32:02.943
IMPLEMENTATION CENTRALIZED

03:32:03.010 --> 03:32:04.812
VERSUS I THINK THE WORD YOU ALL

03:32:04.878 --> 03:32:07.414
USES FEDERATED BUT SEPT SEPARATE

03:32:07.481 --> 03:32:07.648
SYSTEMS.

03:32:07.714 --> 03:32:10.417
LINKED.

03:32:10.484 --> 03:32:12.052
BUT I'M GONNA AB MAYBE JUST

03:32:12.119 --> 03:32:13.320
ROUND OUT THE LAST QUESTION I

03:32:13.387 --> 03:32:15.289
CAN AND TRANSITION THIS BUT

03:32:15.355 --> 03:32:16.390
CERTAINLY --

03:32:16.457 --> 03:32:19.560
HI MY COLLEAGUES WAY AND I DON'T

03:32:19.626 --> 03:32:20.828
THINK --

03:32:20.894 --> 03:32:21.862
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE TALKED

03:32:21.929 --> 03:32:23.997
ABOUT CAN BE UNDERSTATED --

03:32:24.064 --> 03:32:26.233
DOCTOR BROWN MENTIONED THE THE

03:32:26.300 --> 03:32:28.068
DATA SECURITY DATA PRIVACY AND

03:32:28.135 --> 03:32:29.803
NOT ONLY IS THE CHALLENGE OF

03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:31.538
BRINGING OUR ATTORNEYS TO THE

03:32:31.605 --> 03:32:32.840
CONVERSATION INTERPRETATION.

03:32:32.906 --> 03:32:34.108
BUT IT'S ALSO A CONSTANTLY

03:32:34.174 --> 03:32:35.476
SHIFTING --

03:32:35.542 --> 03:32:36.577
ENVIRONMENT --

03:32:36.643 --> 03:32:39.079
IN TERMS OF THE SECURITY THAT'S

03:32:39.146 --> 03:32:41.215
NECESSARY WHAT'S HAPPENING --

03:32:41.281 --> 03:32:43.183
OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE ALSO

03:32:43.250 --> 03:32:47.321
SUBJECT AND TO A TWO FOR EXAMPLE --

03:32:47.387 --> 03:32:48.655
LAWS THAT ARE ARE IT FROM THE

03:32:48.722 --> 03:32:50.357
EUROPEAN UNION IF WE HAVE

03:32:50.424 --> 03:32:52.559
STUDENTS THAT HAVE ENTERED --

03:32:52.626 --> 03:32:54.561
SO THERE ARE CONSTANTLY NEW AND

03:32:54.628 --> 03:32:55.863
EMERGING CHALLENGES IN THE DATA

03:32:55.929 --> 03:32:57.331
SECURITY DATA PRIVACY FRONT AND

03:32:57.397 --> 03:32:58.532
I THINK.

03:32:58.599 --> 03:33:00.000
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL

03:33:00.067 --> 03:33:02.236
AND AND TO CHRISTIANS POINT I

03:33:02.302 --> 03:33:03.137
THINK SPEND A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

03:33:03.203 --> 03:33:04.738
OF TIME ON IT WILL HAVE TO ALSO

03:33:04.805 --> 03:33:06.039
BE VERY MUCH A PART OF THE

03:33:06.106 --> 03:33:06.840
CONVERSATION.

03:33:06.907 --> 03:33:07.975
AND ALL OF THE DATA USAGE THE

03:33:08.041 --> 03:33:10.010
TYPE OF QUESTIONS BUT ALSO THE

03:33:10.077 --> 03:33:11.078
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN

03:33:11.145 --> 03:33:11.879
PRIVATE --

03:33:11.945 --> 03:33:13.413
ADDRESSING PRIVACY AND SECURITY

03:33:13.480 --> 03:33:14.715
CONCERNS BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING

03:33:14.781 --> 03:33:16.250
THAT WE WORK THROUGH I THINK ON

03:33:16.316 --> 03:33:17.618
A DAILY BASIS --

03:33:17.684 --> 03:33:19.253
ACROSS THE BOARD AND ALL THE

03:33:19.319 --> 03:33:20.587
STATEMENTS YOU HAVE HERE WE'RE

03:33:20.654 --> 03:33:21.822
PRETTY SENSITIVE TO THE YEAH

03:33:21.889 --> 03:33:23.357
SURE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY --

03:33:23.423 --> 03:33:25.859
IN TERMS OF YOU CENTRO VERSUS

03:33:25.926 --> 03:33:27.628
FEDERATED AYE I WOULD ALSO ECHO

03:33:27.694 --> 03:33:29.963
THE COMMENTS OF MY CALLING

03:33:30.030 --> 03:33:31.698
DOCTOR BROWN AND IN TERMS OF I

03:33:31.765 --> 03:33:32.866
THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE'S

03:33:32.933 --> 03:33:34.835
PROBABLY A COMMON SET OF OF

03:33:34.902 --> 03:33:35.969
ELEMENTS THAT WE WOULD WANT TO

03:33:36.036 --> 03:33:37.671
BEGIN WITH AND THAT MAKES SENSE

03:33:37.738 --> 03:33:38.906
TO BE -- AS

03:33:38.972 --> 03:33:40.807
A COMMON SYSTEM THAT IT THAT

03:33:40.874 --> 03:33:42.042
THAT WERE ALL USING ACROSS THE

03:33:42.109 --> 03:33:42.910
STATE AND THAT COULD BE

03:33:42.976 --> 03:33:44.444
AUGMENTED OVER TIME --

03:33:44.511 --> 03:33:46.146
SO PERHAPS WE START WITH THAT

03:33:46.213 --> 03:33:48.215
SORT OF CENTRAL REPOSITORY OF OF

03:33:48.282 --> 03:33:50.050
A COMMON SET OF DATA TAT HELPS

03:33:50.117 --> 03:33:54.588
LOOK LONGITUDINALLY ACROSS --

03:33:54.655 --> 03:33:56.657
A CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE AND WE

03:33:56.723 --> 03:33:58.792
BUILDING NEXT IT IS BECAUSE

03:33:58.859 --> 03:34:02.462
URGING NEW WE'VE WE'VE NAMED ALL

03:34:02.529 --> 03:34:03.764
TYPES OF AGENCIES THAT ARE AT

03:34:03.830 --> 03:34:05.165
THE TABLE TODAY --

03:34:05.232 --> 03:34:07.000
THAT ALSO ULTIMATELY I THINK

03:34:07.067 --> 03:34:08.302
WOULD BENEFIT FROM BEING A PART

03:34:08.368 --> 03:34:09.970
OF THE CONVERSATION SO I THINK

03:34:10.037 --> 03:34:11.104
THERE IS AN ELEMENT TO START

03:34:11.171 --> 03:34:12.606
WITH AS A A IS A STATEWIDE

03:34:12.673 --> 03:34:14.107
EFFORT AND THEN WE CAN ADD TO

03:34:14.174 --> 03:34:15.576
THAT IS AS TIME PROGRESSES.

03:34:15.642 --> 03:34:18.078
WELL BECAUSE THERE'S CERTAIN

03:34:18.145 --> 03:34:19.179
TYPES OF DATA THAT.

03:34:19.246 --> 03:34:20.981
EVERYBODY WOULD USE.

03:34:21.048 --> 03:34:22.783
AND THEN THERE'S DATA.

03:34:22.849 --> 03:34:25.152
THAT MAY BE UNIQUELY UTILIZED BY

03:34:25.219 --> 03:34:27.654
YOU SEE OR BY SEA ISSUE.

03:34:27.721 --> 03:34:29.223
EVEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES K.

03:34:29.289 --> 03:34:30.791
TWELVE AND SO THAT WOULD NOT

03:34:30.857 --> 03:34:33.193
NECESSARILY NEED TO BE.

03:34:33.260 --> 03:34:35.062
IN THE COMMON POT.

03:34:35.128 --> 03:34:36.163
AT LEAST INITIALLY.

03:34:36.230 --> 03:34:38.899
SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT ANY

03:34:38.966 --> 03:34:40.300
OTHER ANY YES MA'AM I THINK ONE

03:34:40.367 --> 03:34:40.901
OF THE OTHER THINGS WE THINK

03:34:40.968 --> 03:34:42.035
ABOUT A FEDERATED VERSUS

03:34:42.102 --> 03:34:43.870
CENTRALIZED IT IS IT'S GOING%

03:34:43.937 --> 03:34:45.405
BACK TO THE DATA QUALITY ISSUE

03:34:45.472 --> 03:34:46.073
AND YOU'RE GOING.

03:34:46.139 --> 03:34:47.374
TO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A HIGHER

03:34:47.441 --> 03:34:49.209
LEVEL OF DATA QUALITY AT WHEN

03:34:49.276 --> 03:34:50.410
YOU'RE CLOSEST TO WHERE YOU'RE

03:34:50.477 --> 03:34:51.712
COLLECTING YOUR DATA FROM.

03:34:51.778 --> 03:34:53.313
SO WITH A THOUSAND SCHOOL

03:34:53.380 --> 03:34:56.216
DISTRICTS WE ARE CONTINUE TO YOU

03:34:56.283 --> 03:34:57.584
KNOW IMPLEMENT CHANGES IN OUR

03:34:57.651 --> 03:34:58.452
SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE

03:34:58.518 --> 03:34:59.886
VALIDATIONS MAKE SURE THEY'RE

03:34:59.953 --> 03:35:00.787
SUBMITTING --

03:35:00.854 --> 03:35:02.289
DATA THAT IS THAT IS THAT

03:35:02.356 --> 03:35:03.590
ACCURATE --

03:35:03.657 --> 03:35:05.392
BUT IF YOU TAKE THAT PIECE THE

03:35:05.459 --> 03:35:06.493
WAY YOU YOU YOU BRING IT UP

03:35:06.560 --> 03:35:07.427
ANOTHER TWO LEVELS YOU KNOW

03:35:07.494 --> 03:35:08.528
YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE STE FURTHER

03:35:08.595 --> 03:35:10.063
DISTANCING YOURSELF FROM THE

03:35:10.130 --> 03:35:10.764
STUDENT.

03:35:10.831 --> 03:35:12.699
FROM THE TEACHER FROM THE THE

03:35:12.766 --> 03:35:13.767
ADMINISTRATOR AND FROM THE

03:35:13.834 --> 03:35:16.036
DISTRICT AND SO WE SPEND A GREAT

03:35:16.103 --> 03:35:17.104
DEAL OF TIME MAKING SURE THAT

03:35:17.170 --> 03:35:18.639
DISTRICTS ARE LOOKING AT THE

03:35:18.705 --> 03:35:19.539
DATA PRIOR TO SUBMITTING TO A

03:35:19.606 --> 03:35:20.941
SAINT ARE YOU REALLY SURE THAT

03:35:21.008 --> 03:35:23.910
YOU'RE GIVING US A 100% --

03:35:23.977 --> 03:35:25.112
ATTENDANCE RATES FOR EXAMPLE

03:35:25.178 --> 03:35:26.813
WHICH DID HAPPEN IN OUR FIRST

03:35:26.880 --> 03:35:28.682
OUR FIRST YEAR SO.

03:35:28.749 --> 03:35:29.716
AT SITE AT I WOULD --

03:35:29.783 --> 03:35:33.120
I WOULD LEVERAGE THAT THERE ARE

03:35:33.186 --> 03:35:36.590
PIECES OF AND WHERE THEY COME

03:35:36.657 --> 03:35:37.924
FROM -- YOU

03:35:37.991 --> 03:35:39.259
KNOW WHAT KIND OF IT AT HIGH

03:35:39.326 --> 03:35:40.961
SCHOOL HE ATTENDED I'M A LITTLE

03:35:41.028 --> 03:35:42.496
BIT ABOUT THEM AND THEIR PROGRAM

03:35:42.562 --> 03:35:43.964
BUT THERE ARE OTHERS SUCH AS

03:35:44.031 --> 03:35:45.332
WHAT THEY HAD FOR LUNCH TODAY

03:35:45.399 --> 03:35:46.199
THAT THAT EVEN THE DEPARTMENT

03:35:46.266 --> 03:35:47.801
ISN'T QUITE IT'S NOT RELEVANT TO

03:35:47.868 --> 03:35:49.436
WHAT WE DO AND SO WE THINK ABOUT.

03:35:49.503 --> 03:35:50.637
STARTING WITH WHAT A QUESTION A

03:35:50.704 --> 03:35:51.538
PROBLEM MARIE TRYING TO SOLVE I

03:35:51.605 --> 03:35:53.307
THINK WE GET BETTER AT FIGURING

03:35:53.373 --> 03:35:54.541
OUT HOW TO LEVERAGE.

03:35:54.608 --> 03:35:55.776
ON THE INVESTMENT THE STATUS

03:35:55.842 --> 03:35:57.678
MADE IN EACH OF OUR DATA SYSTEMS

03:35:57.744 --> 03:35:59.279
TODAY AND ESPECIALLY ON THE K.

03:35:59.346 --> 03:36:00.447
TWELVE SIDE --

03:36:00.514 --> 03:36:01.181
YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS

03:36:01.248 --> 03:36:02.849
STORY THAT WE STARTED OFF A

03:36:02.916 --> 03:36:03.784
LITTLE BUMPY BUT WE'VE BEEN A

03:36:03.850 --> 03:36:05.419
SUCCESS STORY IN AND TALKING

03:36:05.485 --> 03:36:06.086
ABOUT -- HOW

03:36:06.153 --> 03:36:07.487
TO PUT OUT A DATA SYSTEM THAT IS

03:36:07.554 --> 03:36:09.489
FUNCTIONING AND --

03:36:09.556 --> 03:36:10.691
IS WORKING ABLE TO PULL DATA

03:36:10.757 --> 03:36:11.291
FROM IT ON ON A REGULAR BASIS

03:36:11.358 --> 03:36:12.392
WELL BUT AND THERE CERTAINLY

03:36:12.459 --> 03:36:13.393
HAVE TO BE QUALITY CONTROL

03:36:13.460 --> 03:36:14.995
CHECKS IN THE PIPELINE BUT AS

03:36:15.062 --> 03:36:16.330
THE DATA MOVES THROUGH BOOK.

03:36:16.396 --> 03:36:17.731
THROUGH THE PIPE BEFORE IT

03:36:17.798 --> 03:36:20.000
LEAVES THE THE PARTICULAR PIPE

03:36:20.067 --> 03:36:21.401
IT'S AN WHICH WOULD BE K.

03:36:21.468 --> 03:36:23.403
THROUGH TWELVE OR K. TWO

03:36:23.470 --> 03:36:24.104
FOURTEEN THEY HAVE TO BE DEBT

03:36:24.171 --> 03:36:28.475
CHECKS ON THE QUALITY THE DATA

03:36:28.542 --> 03:36:29.042
BEFORE DUMPS OUT.

03:36:29.109 --> 03:36:30.577
INTO THE LARGER.

03:36:30.644 --> 03:36:31.311
SYSTEM OF WHATEVER IT IS MY

03:36:31.378 --> 03:36:33.547
QUESTION MY CONCERN CENTRALIZED

03:36:33.613 --> 03:36:35.515
VERSUS FEDERATED IS WE'VE WE'VE

03:36:35.582 --> 03:36:36.883
HAD A GREAT DEAL OF AND MAY NOT

03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:38.518
BE AN ISSUE HERE BUT WE'VE HAD A

03:36:38.585 --> 03:36:40.187
GREAT DEAL OF DIFFICULTY.

03:36:40.253 --> 03:36:41.922
ON THE LARGER STATE LEVEL TRYING

03:36:41.988 --> 03:36:44.691
TO CONNECT DIFFERENT SYSTEMS

03:36:44.758 --> 03:36:45.559
YEAH -- I

03:36:45.625 --> 03:36:48.395
THIS IS MY FIRST RODEO HEARING

03:36:48.462 --> 03:36:49.563
THE CASE SUBCOMMITTEE BUT I

03:36:49.629 --> 03:36:50.931
SPENT SIX YEARS.

03:36:50.997 --> 03:36:52.866
DEALING WITH STATE IT PROJECTS

03:36:52.933 --> 03:36:54.868
IN THE OTHER SUBCOMMITTEE.

03:36:54.935 --> 03:36:56.803
AND THERE WAS NOT MUCH FUN SO I

03:36:56.870 --> 03:36:59.339
WAS JUST I'M JUST WONDERING IF

03:36:59.406 --> 03:37:01.341
IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE TO DO HIS

03:37:01.408 --> 03:37:03.076
FEDERATED APPROACH AND I SUPPOSE

03:37:03.143 --> 03:37:07.280
MY OUR NEXT PANEL WILL ADDRESS

03:37:07.347 --> 03:37:07.481
THAT.

03:37:07.547 --> 03:37:09.783
YEAH I MEAN I THINK.

03:37:09.850 --> 03:37:11.351
SORRY I THINK WE MIGHT ENDUP

03:37:11.418 --> 03:37:12.519
WITH SOMETHING ONE OPTION IS IS

03:37:12.586 --> 03:37:13.153
A BLENDED KIND OF PLAN I THINK

03:37:13.220 --> 03:37:13.854
IT'S RIGHT THERE ARE CERTAIN

03:37:13.920 --> 03:37:15.222
THINGS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO

03:37:15.288 --> 03:37:16.223
WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS

03:37:16.289 --> 03:37:18.258
TO THE INFORMATION. TO ANSWER

03:37:18.325 --> 03:37:19.659
THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE

03:37:19.726 --> 03:37:22.396
HAVING THAT SET OF A KEY

03:37:22.462 --> 03:37:25.065
QUESTIONS THAT YOU WANT THE DATA

03:37:25.132 --> 03:37:25.766
THAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO

03:37:25.832 --> 03:37:28.201
COLLECT STARTING WITH THAT WILL

03:37:28.268 --> 03:37:29.136
GIVE YOU A WAY TO SEE THAT WE'RE

03:37:29.202 --> 03:37:31.004
COLLECTING IT IN SIMILAR WAYS

03:37:31.071 --> 03:37:32.339
THAT WILL MAKE SENSE IF YOU

03:37:32.406 --> 03:37:32.806
COMBINE.

03:37:32.873 --> 03:37:34.307
THEM TOGETHER AND THEN WHEN YOU

03:37:34.374 --> 03:37:37.377
GO SEE TRENDS THAT YOU'RE

03:37:37.444 --> 03:37:38.211
CONCERNED ABOUT THEN THE

03:37:38.278 --> 03:37:40.380
QUESTION IS DO I WANT TO EXPAND

03:37:40.447 --> 03:37:42.249
WHAT I'M COLLECTING CENTRALLY OR

03:37:42.315 --> 03:37:43.683
DO I WANT TO WORK IN A FEDERATED

03:37:43.750 --> 03:37:45.485
WAY TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION

03:37:45.552 --> 03:37:46.319
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION OF THE

03:37:46.386 --> 03:37:47.020
DAY.

03:37:47.087 --> 03:37:47.921
AND THEN --

03:37:47.988 --> 03:37:50.290
GO FROM THERE SO SO I HAVE

03:37:50.357 --> 03:37:52.993
ALWAYS BELIEVED IN A SMALL BUILD

03:37:53.059 --> 03:37:53.493
IT.

03:37:53.560 --> 03:37:55.562
BUT SEE WHAT YOU GET AND THEN --

03:37:55.629 --> 03:37:57.531
SEE OTHER QUESTIONS COME BECAUSE

03:37:57.597 --> 03:37:59.599
OF THE AMOUNT OF WORK IT TAKES

03:37:59.666 --> 03:38:01.101
TO MAINTAIN.

03:38:01.168 --> 03:38:03.103
AT THE SYSTEMS THAT YOU END UP

03:38:03.170 --> 03:38:03.870
CREATING --

03:38:03.937 --> 03:38:05.605
AM I EVEN DO THAT WITH THE TEN

03:38:05.672 --> 03:38:07.007
CAMPUSES THAT WE HAVE THERE'S

03:38:07.073 --> 03:38:08.175
CERTAIN THINGS TAT WE COLLECT

03:38:08.241 --> 03:38:09.709
CENTRALLY THERE ARE OTHER THINGS

03:38:09.776 --> 03:38:12.913
WERE THEN I RELY ON THE CAMPUSES

03:38:12.979 --> 03:38:13.513
BECAUSE THEY'RE BETTER SET TO

03:38:13.580 --> 03:38:14.448
ANSWER THIS.

03:38:14.514 --> 03:38:15.549
I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION ABOUT

03:38:15.615 --> 03:38:17.717
ACTUALLY IS VERY SIMILAR --

03:38:17.784 --> 03:38:20.153
DATABASE WHICH IS UNDER WAY

03:38:20.220 --> 03:38:22.789
RIGHT NOW TO ANSWER THE ASSEMBLY

03:38:22.856 --> 03:38:24.858
BILL THIRTY THIRTY SIX AND W. I.

03:38:24.925 --> 03:38:26.426
YOU A CHAPTER FOUR WE ARE

03:38:26.493 --> 03:38:27.194
TALKING BUT STUDENTS

03:38:27.260 --> 03:38:30.197
LONGITUDINAL DATABASE BUT DEBT

03:38:30.263 --> 03:38:31.131
IS FOR THE WORK FORCE.

03:38:31.198 --> 03:38:32.299
IT IS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF

03:38:32.365 --> 03:38:33.400
CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

03:38:33.467 --> 03:38:35.001
BOARD.

03:38:35.068 --> 03:38:36.870
AND IT IS CALLED CROSS SYSTEM

03:38:36.937 --> 03:38:38.939
ANALYTICS AND ASSIST ASSESSMENT

03:38:39.005 --> 03:38:40.273
FOR LEARNING AND SKILLS

03:38:40.340 --> 03:38:41.441
ATTAINMENT.

03:38:41.508 --> 03:38:44.110
THE CATSKILLS PROJECT AND THERE

03:38:44.177 --> 03:38:46.646
ARE THE PARKING DATA PARTNERS ON

03:38:46.713 --> 03:38:48.215
LIKE ARE ELEVEN DIFFERENT

03:38:48.281 --> 03:38:49.850
DEPARTMENTS.

03:38:49.916 --> 03:38:52.018
AND DAY INCLUDING ADD DEPARTMENT

03:38:52.085 --> 03:38:54.187
OF THREE HAVE GOT FLASH GOT GOD

03:38:54.254 --> 03:38:56.022
WORKS COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND

03:38:56.089 --> 03:38:58.124
CAREER TECH EDUCATION STATE

03:38:58.191 --> 03:38:59.426
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM.

03:38:59.493 --> 03:39:01.528
SO WHY I'M MENTIONING THIS ONE

03:39:01.595 --> 03:39:03.330
ACTUALLY THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE

03:39:03.396 --> 03:39:05.332
BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF CHALLENGES

03:39:05.398 --> 03:39:07.467
TO CREATE THAT DAY ABOUT WHAT

03:39:07.534 --> 03:39:07.901
THEY WANT.

03:39:07.968 --> 03:39:10.303
WHAT ARE THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS

03:39:10.370 --> 03:39:15.442
TO CREATE WHAT FORCE METRICS

03:39:15.509 --> 03:39:17.344
DASHBOARD AND ONLY?

03:39:17.410 --> 03:39:18.845
AB MERGER PROGRAM PARTICIPATION

03:39:18.912 --> 03:39:20.113
EFFECTIVE TRACKING UP OR

03:39:20.180 --> 03:39:21.281
DISPENSED AND IMPROVE

03:39:21.348 --> 03:39:22.315
PERFORMANCE ON A CAR

03:39:22.382 --> 03:39:23.316
ACCOUNTABILITY SO IT LOOKS LIKE

03:39:23.383 --> 03:39:24.451
IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE

03:39:24.518 --> 03:39:26.086
ARE TALKING ABOUT LONGITUDINAL

03:39:26.152 --> 03:39:26.820
DATABASE.

03:39:26.887 --> 03:39:28.388
SO THEY IF IT CAN BE CONSULTED

THE CENTER TO ANSWER YOUR QUEST

03:39:41.935 --> 03:39:42.936
TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION ABOUT

03:39:43.003 --> 03:39:44.771
CENTRALIZED VERSUS FEDERATED OR

03:39:44.838 --> 03:39:46.406
DECENTRALIZED --

03:39:46.473 --> 03:39:47.641

IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL AID ONE

03:39:48.975 --> 03:39:50.443

SEPARATE ISSUE BY ITSELF THAT IS

03:39:59.753 --> 03:40:00.320
TO SAY.

03:40:00.387 --> 03:40:02.522
IF ONE VIEWS THE WHOLE PURPOSE

INTO STUDENTS HANDS.

03:40:08.428 --> 03:40:10.230
WELL THEN FOR THE MOST PART AND

03:40:10.297 --> 03:40:11.231

THEY ARRIVE AT CALVIN ELIGIBLE

03:40:23.476 --> 03:40:27.547
CAMPUS AND WE ONE OF THE THE

03:40:27.614 --> 03:40:28.014
THINGS THAT I THINK A

03:40:28.081 --> 03:40:29.282
CENTRALIZED DATA SYSTEM COULD DO

03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:30.050
IS.

03:40:30.116 --> 03:40:31.651
HELP WITH THESE OTHER QUESTIONS

FROM HAVING BEEN MY MINERAL TWO

03:40:37.490 --> 03:40:39.859
COMMISSION THAT LEGISLATORS AND

03:40:39.926 --> 03:40:40.660
LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND

STAKEHOLDER AREN'T JUST

03:40:42.028 --> 03:40:43.063
INTERESTED IN.

03:40:43.129 --> 03:40:43.797
YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST IN MORE

03:40:43.863 --> 03:40:45.732
THAN JUST HOW GOODA JOB YOU DO

03:40:45.799 --> 03:40:47.167
GETTING MONEY INTO THE STUDENTS'

TO SUCCEED HOW YOU KNOW HOW WE

03:40:50.770 --> 03:40:51.838
LOOK AT THE WHOLE STUDENT.

03:40:51.905 --> 03:40:53.306
WHAT OTHER NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE

03:40:53.373 --> 03:40:55.141
TO WHAT EXTENT CAN THE FINANCIAL

03:40:55.208 --> 03:40:56.042
AID SYSTEM PLAY A ROLE IN LEVY

03:40:56.109 --> 03:40:58.578
EATING FOOD AND SECURITY HOUSING --

03:40:58.645 --> 03:41:02.549
IN SECURITY HOMELESSNESS AMONG

03:41:02.616 --> 03:41:03.650
STUDENTS I THINK THAT.

03:41:03.717 --> 03:41:04.250
AS LONG AS WE'RE STILL LOOKING

03:41:04.317 --> 03:41:04.751
AT THE ISSUE OF COLLEGE

03:41:04.818 --> 03:41:06.653
AFFORDABILITY AS BEING MORE THAN

03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:08.421
JUST ABOUT HOW DO WE GET A CHECK

03:41:08.488 --> 03:41:10.657
INTO STUDENTS HAND BUT HOW DO WE

03:41:10.724 --> 03:41:12.626
ENSURE THAT THE WHOLE STUDENT.

03:41:12.692 --> 03:41:13.827
IS CARED FOR AND HAS WHAT THEY

03:41:13.893 --> 03:41:15.962
NEED TO SUCCEED THEN IT SEEMS TO

03:41:16.029 --> 03:41:17.263
ME AND THIS IS JUST MY OPINION

03:41:17.330 --> 03:41:18.198
NOT SPEAKING FOR THE COMMISSION

03:41:18.264 --> 03:41:19.499
HERE THAT MAKES A PRETTY GOOD

03:41:19.566 --> 03:41:20.467
ARGUMENT FOR SOME TYPE OF

03:41:20.533 --> 03:41:21.801
CENTRALIZED DATA SYSTEM.

03:41:21.868 --> 03:41:22.936
RIGHT.

03:41:23.003 --> 03:41:25.071
OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE MOST

03:41:25.138 --> 03:41:27.040

03:41:37.684 --> 03:41:39.219
NO QUESTIONS BUT JUST FROM JUST

03:41:39.285 --> 03:41:40.887
SOME THOUGHTS TO REITERATE SOME

03:41:40.954 --> 03:41:41.521
OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:41:41.588 --> 03:41:42.088
MADE -- I

03:41:42.155 --> 03:41:43.356
THOUGHT THIS PANEL DID A REALLY

03:41:43.423 --> 03:41:45.125
NICE JOB OF KIND OF HIGHLIGHTING

03:41:45.191 --> 03:41:46.192
YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT DATA

03:41:46.259 --> 03:41:46.826
COLLECTION EFFORTS THAT WERE OUT

03:41:46.893 --> 03:41:48.528
THERE IN SOME OF THE CHALLENGES

03:41:48.595 --> 03:41:49.529
THAT EXIST --

03:41:49.596 --> 03:41:50.830
CHALLENGES THAT THE

03:41:50.897 --> 03:41:52.032
ADMINISTRATION HAS IDENTIFIED I

03:41:52.098 --> 03:41:53.466
MEANT THAT THIS PANEL --

03:41:53.533 --> 03:41:55.635
UNIT REITERATED CHALLENGES LIKE

03:41:55.702 --> 03:41:57.137
IN THE SYSTEMS ARE OPERATING

03:41:57.203 --> 03:41:58.538
UNDER DIFFERENT REGULATORY

03:41:58.605 --> 03:41:59.773
REQUIREMENTS ARE OFTEN USING

03:41:59.839 --> 03:42:02.008
DIFFERENT DATA DEFINITIONS.

03:42:02.075 --> 03:42:03.677
AND THERE'S A VARYING DEGREE OF

03:42:03.743 --> 03:42:04.944
CONNECTEDNESS AND USER FRIENDLY

03:42:05.011 --> 03:42:06.780
USER FRIENDLINESS --

OF THOSE CHALLENGES GOING

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE

03:43:04.704 --> 03:43:07.173
EDUCATION.

03:43:07.240 --> 03:43:09.175
CENTER FIVE MINUTES.

03:43:09.242 --> 03:43:11.111
WERE YOU HEARD OUR DISCUSSION SO

03:43:11.177 --> 03:43:11.411

03:43:11.478 --> 03:43:13.213
YEAH.

03:43:13.279 --> 03:43:20.386
WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST?

03:43:20.453 --> 03:43:23.089

THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY.

03:43:29.929 --> 03:43:31.297
I THINK THAT I'M PROBABLY MORE

03:43:31.364 --> 03:43:33.233
EDUCATION IN LIKE MANNER AND I

03:43:33.299 --> 03:43:34.868
WAS ASKED TO GET COMMENTS TODAY

03:43:34.934 --> 03:43:37.537
BASED ON RESEARCH I DID A COUPLE

03:43:37.604 --> 03:43:38.671
OF YEARS.

03:43:38.738 --> 03:43:39.405
ON CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH TO

03:43:39.472 --> 03:43:40.573
TRACKING STUDENT PROGRESS ACROSS

03:43:40.640 --> 03:43:41.841
K. TWELVE AND HIGHER ED AND ITS

03:43:41.908 --> 03:43:42.742
NEEDS GOING FORWARD I THINK I

03:43:42.809 --> 03:43:44.911
GAVE US SUMMARY DOCUMENT.

03:43:44.978 --> 03:43:46.346
YOU DON'T HAVE TO REFERENCE IT

03:43:46.412 --> 03:43:49.249
WHILE I'M TALKING BUT JUST.

03:43:49.315 --> 03:43:51.584
I READ THE ONE THAT WAS IN MY

03:43:51.651 --> 03:43:53.953
PACKET OUT OKAY.

03:43:54.020 --> 03:43:56.222
WHEN IN DOING REMARKS MAYBE YOU

03:43:56.289 --> 03:43:56.756
COULD TOUCH ON SOME OF THE

03:43:56.823 --> 03:43:57.390
ISSUES?

03:43:57.457 --> 03:43:59.359
YES PHYLLIS I WILL TRY TO DO

03:43:59.425 --> 03:44:00.493
PREPARED REMARKS THAT I THINK

03:44:00.560 --> 03:44:01.795
ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS

03:44:01.861 --> 03:44:03.797
BUT I DID MAKE MYSELF NOTES

03:44:03.863 --> 03:44:06.332
ABOUT LIKE PLACES TO DIVERT. TO

03:44:06.399 --> 03:44:07.901
TO ANSWER THINGS THAT YOU ASKED

03:44:07.967 --> 03:44:09.035
SO -- ANYWAY

03:44:09.102 --> 03:44:10.670
I DID RESEARCH OVER A COUPLE OF

03:44:10.737 --> 03:44:12.038
YEARS AND I'D LIKE TO START WITH

03:44:12.105 --> 03:44:13.573
THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF WHAT I

03:44:13.640 --> 03:44:15.675
FOUND SO WHILE THERE IS NO

03:44:15.742 --> 03:44:16.976
STATEWIDE CROSS SECTOR DATA

03:44:17.043 --> 03:44:18.611
SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA.

03:44:18.678 --> 03:44:20.513
THE FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEMS

03:44:20.580 --> 03:44:21.881
EACH HAVE LONGITUDINAL STUDENT

03:44:21.948 --> 03:44:23.716
DATA SYSTEMS THAT ARE QUITE GOOD

03:44:23.783 --> 03:44:26.219
AS YOU HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT --

03:44:26.286 --> 03:44:29.122
INCLUDES CAL PAD SYSTEM IT'S AND

03:44:29.189 --> 03:44:31.124
SICK AT SEGMENTS ALSO HAS A

03:44:31.191 --> 03:44:32.725
LONGITUDINAL STUDENT DATA SYSTEM.

03:44:32.792 --> 03:44:34.060
SO THESE SYSTEMS CONTAIN

03:44:34.127 --> 03:44:35.728
INFORMATION THAT'S VERY VALUABLE

03:44:35.795 --> 03:44:36.663
FOR UNDERSTANDING STUDENT

03:44:36.729 --> 03:44:39.232
PROGRESS AN OUTCOME WITH IN EACH

03:44:39.299 --> 03:44:40.300
SYSTEM.

03:44:40.366 --> 03:44:41.935
SO THE INFORMATION ARE GENERALLY

03:44:42.001 --> 03:44:43.970
UPDATED ANNUALLY IN SOME CASES

03:44:44.037 --> 03:44:46.139
OR AT SPECIFIED POINTS DURING

03:44:46.206 --> 03:44:48.274
EACH TERM IN OTHER CASES

03:44:48.341 --> 03:44:49.976
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE DATA IS.

03:44:50.043 --> 03:44:51.177
AND THEY HAVE SOME INFORMATION

03:44:51.244 --> 03:44:53.213
THAT'S MATCHED TO OTHER STATE

03:44:53.279 --> 03:44:55.215
AGENCIES SO SEE SACK --

03:44:55.281 --> 03:44:56.349
GIVES THE HIGHER END SEGMENTS

03:44:56.416 --> 03:44:57.917
YOU KNOW SOME FINANCIAL AID

03:44:57.984 --> 03:44:59.619
RELATED DATA THEY GET MATCHES TO

03:44:59.686 --> 03:45:02.622
EDT DATA AS YOU ALSO HEARD TALK

03:45:02.689 --> 03:45:03.957
ABOUT.

03:45:04.023 --> 03:45:05.925
SO WHAT THESE DATA ARE PRIMARILY

03:45:05.992 --> 03:45:07.560
USED FOR STATE AND FEDERAL

03:45:07.627 --> 03:45:09.529
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

03:45:09.596 --> 03:45:10.997
BUT IN RECENT YEARS EACH SYSTEM

03:45:11.064 --> 03:45:13.199
OFFICE HAS INCREASED ITS EFFORTS

03:45:13.266 --> 03:45:14.667
TO MAKE IT MORE INFORMATION

03:45:14.734 --> 03:45:16.502
AVAILABLE THROUGH ONLINE DATA

03:45:16.569 --> 03:45:18.071
DASHBOARDS AND OTHER REPORTS YOU

03:45:18.137 --> 03:45:19.472
HEARD THEM MENTION A COUPLE OF

03:45:19.539 --> 03:45:21.774
THINGS THE SALARY ARE FOR AN

03:45:21.841 --> 03:45:23.443
UC'S INFO CENTER --

03:45:23.509 --> 03:45:24.711
THEY SOMETIMES SHARE STUDENT

03:45:24.777 --> 03:45:26.546
DATA AMONG THEMSELVES TO ADDRESS

03:45:26.613 --> 03:45:28.047
PARTICULAR NEEDS AS YOU HEARD

03:45:28.114 --> 03:45:29.082
THEM DESCRIBED.

03:45:29.148 --> 03:45:31.084
SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH HAVING FOR

03:45:31.150 --> 03:45:33.219
GOOD LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEMS

03:45:33.286 --> 03:45:36.055
BUT NO CROSS SECTOR DATA SYSTEM.

03:45:36.122 --> 03:45:38.258
SO I'LL POINT TWO THREE ISSUES.

03:45:38.324 --> 03:45:40.159
UP FIRST THE INFORMATION WE HAVE

03:45:40.226 --> 03:45:42.228
ABOUT STUDENT PROGRESS IN

03:45:42.295 --> 03:45:43.463
OUTCOMES IS DISCONNECTED.

03:45:43.529 --> 03:45:45.064
WELL THERE IS SOME DATA SHARING

03:45:45.131 --> 03:45:47.300
AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL AS I NOTED

03:45:47.367 --> 03:45:48.635
AND THERE ARE SOME VOLUNTARY.

03:45:48.701 --> 03:45:49.969
DATA SHARING EFFORTS ACROSS

03:45:50.036 --> 03:45:53.673
INSTITUTIONS IN SOME REGIONS.

03:45:53.740 --> 03:45:54.207
WE HAVE NO WAY TO GET A

03:45:54.274 --> 03:45:56.809
COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE PICTURE

03:45:56.876 --> 03:45:58.211
OF THE EDUCATION TO WORK FORCE

03:45:58.278 --> 03:45:59.646
PIPELINE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:45:59.712 --> 03:46:01.180
SO FROM A BUDGET AND POLICY

03:46:01.247 --> 03:46:02.715
PERSPECTIVE WHAT THIS DOES IS

03:46:02.782 --> 03:46:04.284
REINFORCES CALIFORNIA'S VERY

03:46:04.350 --> 03:46:06.152
STYLISH APPROACH TO EDUCATION

03:46:06.219 --> 03:46:07.186
PLANNING.

03:46:07.253 --> 03:46:10.223
OUR SECOND ISSUE IS THAT THE AND

03:46:10.290 --> 03:46:12.225
LEE AND ACCESSIBLE WHILE I DID

03:46:12.292 --> 03:46:13.459
MENTION THAT EACH SYSTEM HAS

03:46:13.526 --> 03:46:15.461
PROVIDE SOME GOOD INFORMATION

03:46:15.528 --> 03:46:17.597
IT'S OFTEN COMPLIANCE FOCUSED OR

03:46:17.664 --> 03:46:19.265
FRAMED IN WAYS THAT SUIT THE

03:46:19.332 --> 03:46:20.833
NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF THE

03:46:20.900 --> 03:46:21.901
SYSTEMS THEMSELVES.

03:46:21.968 --> 03:46:23.569
SIMILAR INFORMATION IS OFTEN

03:46:23.636 --> 03:46:25.138
CALCULATED AND PRESENTED VERY

03:46:25.204 --> 03:46:27.106
DIFFERENTLY ACROSS THE SYSTEMS

03:46:27.173 --> 03:46:28.641
MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR POLICY

03:46:28.708 --> 03:46:31.110
MAKERS EDUCATORS STUDENTS IN THE

03:46:31.177 --> 03:46:32.478
PUBLIC TO INTERPRET IT.

03:46:32.545 --> 03:46:35.381
A THIRD ISSUE IS INEFFICIENCY

03:46:35.448 --> 03:46:36.249
THE CURRENT APPROACH HAVE A

03:46:36.316 --> 03:46:38.151
NUMBER HAVE INTO INEFFICIENCIES

03:46:38.217 --> 03:46:40.253
BUILT INTO IT AND ONE OF THEM

03:46:40.320 --> 03:46:40.820
KIND OF CAME UP ON THE LAST

03:46:40.887 --> 03:46:42.055
PANEL.

03:46:42.121 --> 03:46:43.456
SO AS ONE EXAMPLE WE HAVE

03:46:43.523 --> 03:46:45.959
MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND INDIVIDUAL

03:46:46.025 --> 03:46:47.894
INSTITUTIONS THAT CONTRACT WITH

03:46:47.961 --> 03:46:48.895
THE NATIONAL STUDENT

03:46:48.962 --> 03:46:50.697
CLEARINGHOUSE JUST IN AN EFFORT

03:46:50.763 --> 03:46:51.898
TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT

03:46:51.965 --> 03:46:53.299
HAPPENS TO THEIR STUDENTS WHEN

03:46:53.366 --> 03:46:54.567
THEY LEAVE SO THIS IS.

03:46:54.634 --> 03:46:55.969
SURELY A BOON FOR THE STUDENT

03:46:56.035 --> 03:46:57.770
CLEARING HOUSE BUT IT'S A REAL

03:46:57.837 --> 03:46:59.305
FAILURE TO LEVERAGE STATE

03:46:59.372 --> 03:47:00.873
RESOURCES.

03:47:00.940 --> 03:47:02.175
SO HAVING GOOD INFORMATION

03:47:02.241 --> 03:47:03.476
THAT'S DISCONNECTED AN

03:47:03.543 --> 03:47:05.712
INACCESSIBLE WITH INEFFICIENT

03:47:05.778 --> 03:47:06.612
MEANS OF PUTTING THE PIECES

03:47:06.679 --> 03:47:07.981
TOGETHER WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT

03:47:08.047 --> 03:47:09.582
LEAVES US UNABLE TO ANSWER

03:47:09.649 --> 03:47:10.984
CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT STUDENT

03:47:11.050 --> 03:47:12.518
PROGRESS AND OUT COMES ACROSS

03:47:12.585 --> 03:47:13.553
SYSTEMS.

03:47:13.619 --> 03:47:15.221
AND IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO

03:47:15.288 --> 03:47:16.889
DEVELOP EVIDENCE BASED POLICIES

03:47:16.956 --> 03:47:18.658
AND PRACTICES THAT WILL BEST

03:47:18.725 --> 03:47:20.760
SERVE STUDENTS AS THEY MOVE

03:47:20.827 --> 03:47:22.028
THROUGH MULTIPLE SYSTEMS.

03:47:22.095 --> 03:47:24.130
SO YOU ASKED ABOUT SOME SPECIFIC

03:47:24.197 --> 03:47:25.865
EXAMPLES OF QUESTIONS AND ONE OF

03:47:25.932 --> 03:47:28.101
MY REPORTS I HAD A LIST OF JUST

03:47:28.167 --> 03:47:29.802
EXAMPLES OF CRITICAL QUESTIONS

03:47:29.869 --> 03:47:31.237
WE CAN'T NOW ANSWER.

03:47:31.304 --> 03:47:33.239
SALT GIVE YOU A COUPLE THAT ARE

03:47:33.306 --> 03:47:35.575
PARTICULARLY POLICY FOCUSED JUST

03:47:35.641 --> 03:47:36.509
AS EXAMPLES.

03:47:36.576 --> 03:47:38.678
SO WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES OF CS

03:47:38.745 --> 03:47:39.712
YOU WHEN YOU SEE TEACHER

03:47:39.779 --> 03:47:40.947
CANDIDATES AND WHAT IS THEIR

03:47:41.014 --> 03:47:42.515
READY MISS AND RATE OF RETENTION

03:47:42.582 --> 03:47:43.683
WHEN THEY CAN BECOME EMPLOYED BY

03:47:43.750 --> 03:47:45.685
THE STATE K. TWELVE SCHOOLS.

03:47:45.752 --> 03:47:47.420
THAT'S AN ISSUE YOU MIGHT BE

03:47:47.487 --> 03:47:48.321
ABLE TO ADDRESS WITH A

03:47:48.388 --> 03:47:49.889
LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM IF YOU

03:47:49.956 --> 03:47:51.257
INCLUDED --

03:47:51.324 --> 03:47:53.960
INFORMATION ALSO FROM THE

03:47:54.027 --> 03:47:55.161
TEACHER CREDENTIALING COMMISSION.

03:47:55.228 --> 03:47:56.062
HOW MANY --

03:47:56.129 --> 03:47:57.430
WHAT HAPPENS TO ELIGIBLE

03:47:57.497 --> 03:47:59.165
STUDENTS WHO MEET ELIGIBILITY

03:47:59.232 --> 03:48:00.867
REQUIREMENTS FOR CS YOU WHEN YOU

03:48:00.933 --> 03:48:03.569
SEE BUT THEY'RE NOT ADMITTED DUE

03:48:03.636 --> 03:48:05.104
TO CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS?

03:48:05.171 --> 03:48:06.539
WHERE DO THEY GO TO THEY GO TO

03:48:06.606 --> 03:48:08.574
COLLEGE WHERE THEY GO?

03:48:08.641 --> 03:48:09.876
OUR DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVE WOULD

03:48:09.942 --> 03:48:10.943
HAVE A PROBLEM THERE RIGHT

03:48:11.010 --> 03:48:14.047
BECAUSE SOMEONE TESTIFIED IN THE

03:48:14.113 --> 03:48:15.815
K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM.

03:48:15.882 --> 03:48:17.050
THEY DON'T CAPTURE SOCIAL

03:48:17.116 --> 03:48:21.187
SECURITY NUMBERS.

03:48:21.254 --> 03:48:23.723
IN K. TO TWELVE SO IN TRYING TO

03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:25.324
FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WERE THEY

03:48:25.391 --> 03:48:27.060
GO ON WHAT THEY DO.

03:48:27.126 --> 03:48:28.528
WE HAVE A PROBLEM RIGHT.

03:48:28.594 --> 03:48:30.329
AT THE MOMENT WE DO BUT YOU

03:48:30.396 --> 03:48:32.865
COULD LOOK AND SEE IF.

03:48:32.932 --> 03:48:34.700
THE STUDENTS WHO WERE SAY DENIED

03:48:34.767 --> 03:48:36.936
ADMISSION EVEN THOUGH THEY MET

03:48:37.003 --> 03:48:38.838
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS --

03:48:38.905 --> 03:48:41.174
THEY HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED

03:48:41.240 --> 03:48:42.708
SECURITY NUMBER AS PART OF

03:48:42.775 --> 03:48:44.777
HAVING APPLIED SO YOU WOULD HAVE

03:48:44.844 --> 03:48:46.846
IT SO YOU CAN THEN LOOK AND SEE

03:48:46.913 --> 03:48:47.380
DID THEY GO TO A COMMUNITY

03:48:47.447 --> 03:48:48.347
COLLEGE.

03:48:48.414 --> 03:48:49.715
WITH A MATCH TO THE CLEARING

03:48:49.782 --> 03:48:51.117
HOUSE DID THEY GO OUT OF STATE

03:48:51.184 --> 03:48:52.585
DEBATE WITH THE MATCH TO EDT DID

03:48:52.652 --> 03:48:54.854
THEY END UP GOING STRAIGHT TO

03:48:54.921 --> 03:48:55.655
WORK AND DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE AT

03:48:55.721 --> 03:48:56.489
ALL.

03:48:56.556 --> 03:48:57.690
SO THOSE THOSE ARE KINDS OF

03:48:57.757 --> 03:48:58.958
THINGS YOU CAN FIGURE OUT LIKE

03:48:59.025 --> 03:49:00.526
WHAT HAPPENED WHAT WHAT ARE THE

03:49:00.593 --> 03:49:02.095
CONSEQUENCES OF OUR CAPACITY

03:49:02.161 --> 03:49:04.097
CONSTRAINTS IN THE CSU WHEN YOU

03:49:04.163 --> 03:49:08.167
SEE SYSTEMS ON ACTUAL STUDENTS.

03:49:08.234 --> 03:49:08.768
SO YOU KNOW JUST AS ONE MORE

03:49:08.835 --> 03:49:10.403
EXAMPLE ARE DISTRICTS THAT

03:49:10.470 --> 03:49:12.038
RECEIVE EXTRA FUNDING THROUGH

03:49:12.105 --> 03:49:13.005
THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

03:49:13.072 --> 03:49:14.540
FORMULA INCREASING THE

03:49:14.607 --> 03:49:15.675
PROPORTION OF THEIR STUDENTS WHO

03:49:15.741 --> 03:49:16.843
ENROLL IN COLLEGE READY TO

03:49:16.909 --> 03:49:18.177
SUCCEED.

03:49:18.244 --> 03:49:19.645
WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A LOT OF BIG

03:49:19.712 --> 03:49:21.147
STAE INITIATIVES AND POLICIES

03:49:21.214 --> 03:49:22.949
IN RECENT YEARS WITH VERY LITTLE

03:49:23.015 --> 03:49:25.118
ABILITY --

03:49:25.184 --> 03:49:25.718
TO ANALYZE HOW EFFECTIVE THEY

03:49:25.785 --> 03:49:26.719
ARE.

03:49:26.786 --> 03:49:28.421
SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES

03:49:28.488 --> 03:49:29.856
OF QUESTIONS YOU KNOW THAT YOU

03:49:29.922 --> 03:49:31.124
MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN THAT A

03:49:31.190 --> 03:49:32.525
LONGITUDINAL.

03:49:32.592 --> 03:49:34.961
DATA SYSTEM COULD ADDRESS.

03:49:35.027 --> 03:49:36.762
AS TO THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN

03:49:36.829 --> 03:49:38.431
DEVELOPING A DATA SYSTEM MY

03:49:38.498 --> 03:49:39.866
RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THERE

03:49:39.932 --> 03:49:42.101
LARGELY POLITICAL AND CULTURAL.

03:49:42.168 --> 03:49:43.703
THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS

03:49:43.769 --> 03:49:45.905
COMING RATHER LATE TO THE PARTY

03:49:45.972 --> 03:49:47.807
IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING A

03:49:47.874 --> 03:49:49.408
STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEM IS

03:49:49.475 --> 03:49:51.077
ACTUALLY HELPFUL IN REGARD TO

03:49:51.144 --> 03:49:52.478
TECHNICAL CHALLENGES.

03:49:52.545 --> 03:49:54.514
MOST OTHER STATES HAVE OR ARE IN

03:49:54.580 --> 03:49:56.215
THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING SUCH

03:49:56.282 --> 03:49:57.817
DATA SYSTEMS WHICH GIVES US

03:49:57.884 --> 03:49:59.018
PLENTY OF EXAMPLES TO LEARN FROM

03:49:59.085 --> 03:50:01.487
AS PAM BROWN MENTIONED EARLIER.

03:50:01.554 --> 03:50:03.156
THE STATES HAVE ALREADY FACED

03:50:03.222 --> 03:50:04.557
ISSUES LIKE MATCHING RECORDS

03:50:04.624 --> 03:50:05.458
WHEN K. TWELVE AND POST

03:50:05.525 --> 03:50:07.260
SECONDARY HAVE DIFFERENT STUDENT

03:50:07.326 --> 03:50:10.029
ID'S OR FIGURING OUT MECHANISMS

03:50:10.096 --> 03:50:12.231
TO MAINTAIN DATAPRIVACY AND

03:50:12.298 --> 03:50:13.699
SECURITY THERE ARE PLENTY OF

03:50:13.766 --> 03:50:15.635
REPORTS TO READ AND EXPERTS TO

03:50:15.701 --> 03:50:17.737
CONSULT TO UNDERSTAND AND APPLY

03:50:17.803 --> 03:50:19.805
THE LESSONS FROM THOSE STATES.

03:50:19.872 --> 03:50:20.873
TO OUR OWN CONTEXT.

03:50:20.940 --> 03:50:22.175
THE BIGGER CHALLENGES ARE IN

03:50:22.241 --> 03:50:23.776
DECIDING WHAT BASIC TYPE OF DATA

03:50:23.843 --> 03:50:25.444
SYSTEM TO DEVELOP AND

03:50:25.511 --> 03:50:26.879
IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE

03:50:26.946 --> 03:50:29.182
LEADERSHIP FOR THE EFFORT.

03:50:29.248 --> 03:50:31.117
SO DO WE URSUE A TRADITIONAL

03:50:31.184 --> 03:50:32.485
STATEWIDE LONGITUDINAL DATA

03:50:32.552 --> 03:50:34.053
SYSTEM THAT INVOLVES CONNECTING

03:50:34.120 --> 03:50:36.022
THE RECORDS ACROSS THESE FOR

03:50:36.088 --> 03:50:38.257
SYSTEMS THAT W ALREADY HAVE.

03:50:38.324 --> 03:50:39.959
THIS IS THE APPROACH USED IN

03:50:40.026 --> 03:50:41.727
OTHER STATES AND IT HAS THE

03:50:41.794 --> 03:50:42.995
ADVANTAGES OF LEVERAGING

03:50:43.062 --> 03:50:44.430
CALIFORNIA'S CONSIDERABLE

03:50:44.497 --> 03:50:45.898
EXISTING INVESTMENTS.

03:50:45.965 --> 03:50:47.500
AND REQUIRING A FAIRLY SHORT

03:50:47.567 --> 03:50:50.236
TIME LINE TO DEVELOP AT A MORE

03:50:50.303 --> 03:50:51.637
REASONABLE COST.

03:50:51.704 --> 03:50:53.005
SOME ARGUE THAT INSTEAD

03:50:53.072 --> 03:50:54.473
CALIFORNIA SHOULD TRY TO DEVELOP

03:50:54.540 --> 03:50:56.142
A DATA SYSTEMTHAT INVOLVES MORE

03:50:56.209 --> 03:50:58.945
FREQUENT UP LOADS OF INFORMATION.

03:50:59.011 --> 03:51:00.012
THAT WOULD COME FROM INDIVIDUAL

03:51:00.079 --> 03:51:02.782
SCHOOL BUT ONE THAT COULD BE

03:51:02.848 --> 03:51:05.017
USED TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO

03:51:05.084 --> 03:51:06.252
INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS AS THEY

03:51:06.319 --> 03:51:09.055
TRANSITION ACROSS INSTITUTIONS I

03:51:09.121 --> 03:51:10.022
BELIEVE CHRISTIAN REFER TO THAT

03:51:10.089 --> 03:51:11.490
AS MAKING SURE WE'RE SERVING

03:51:11.557 --> 03:51:12.959
LOCAL PRINTER OF LOCAL

03:51:13.025 --> 03:51:14.527
PRACTITIONER LANDS.

03:51:14.594 --> 03:51:15.995
IN A DATA SYSTEM.

03:51:16.062 --> 03:51:17.129
SO WHILE THERE ARE PROMISING

03:51:17.196 --> 03:51:18.664
LOCAL AND REGIONAL EXAMPLES OF

03:51:18.731 --> 03:51:20.199
SUCH SYSTEMS THERE SIGNIFICANT

03:51:20.266 --> 03:51:22.301
CONCERNS IN CONSIDERING THEM AS

03:51:22.368 --> 03:51:23.869
THE MODEL. FOR THE INITIAL

03:51:23.936 --> 03:51:25.204
DEVELOPMENT OF A STATEWIDE

03:51:25.271 --> 03:51:26.806
SYSTEM IN TERMS OF LARGER

03:51:26.872 --> 03:51:29.275
TECHNICAL BARRIERS GREATER COSTS

03:51:29.342 --> 03:51:30.943
IN AN EXTENSIVE TIME FRAME

03:51:31.010 --> 03:51:32.645
BEFORE COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE

03:51:32.712 --> 03:51:34.480
DATA MIGHT BE AVAILABLE.

03:51:34.547 --> 03:51:36.082
SO IF CALIFORNIA DECIDED TO

03:51:36.148 --> 03:51:37.750
PURSUE AT LEAST AS AN INITIAL

03:51:37.817 --> 03:51:39.485
APPROACH A MORE TRADITIONAL

03:51:39.552 --> 03:51:40.953
STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEM.

03:51:41.020 --> 03:51:42.521
THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE WOULD SEEM

03:51:42.588 --> 03:51:43.756
TO INVOLVE DECIDING ON A

03:51:43.823 --> 03:51:45.291
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE.

03:51:45.358 --> 03:51:46.892
OTHER STATES USE A VARIETY OF

03:51:46.959 --> 03:51:48.794
APPROACHES MY RESEARCH ENDED UP

03:51:48.861 --> 03:51:50.263
CONCLUDING THAT CALIFORNIA MIGHT

03:51:50.329 --> 03:51:52.298
BEST BE SERVED BY ESTABLISHING A

03:51:52.365 --> 03:51:54.433
STATE DATA AGENCY OR A DATA

03:51:54.500 --> 03:51:56.469
OFFICE WITHIN SOME EXISTING

03:51:56.535 --> 03:51:57.837
STATE AGENCY.

03:51:57.903 --> 03:51:59.372
THAT HAVE THE SPECIFIC MISSION

03:51:59.438 --> 03:52:00.906
OF DEVELOPING A CENTRALIZED DATA

03:52:00.973 --> 03:52:03.175
WAREHOUSE PRODUCING STANDARD

03:52:03.242 --> 03:52:04.777
REPORTS AND DATA TOOLS FOR

03:52:04.844 --> 03:52:07.613
VARIOUS AUDIENCES AND MANAGING

03:52:07.680 --> 03:52:09.115
ACCESS TO THE DATA.

03:52:09.181 --> 03:52:10.750
AND PRIVACY AND SECURITY

03:52:10.816 --> 03:52:12.618
CONCERNS OF COURSE THIS

03:52:12.685 --> 03:52:13.619
STRUCTURE WOULD ENSURE THAT

03:52:13.686 --> 03:52:15.421
THERE'S AN ENTITY RESPONSIBLE

03:52:15.488 --> 03:52:16.756
FOR GETTING THIS DONE.

03:52:16.822 --> 03:52:18.057
IN COLLABORATION WITH THE

03:52:18.124 --> 03:52:19.892
SEGMENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPATING

03:52:19.959 --> 03:52:21.694
AGENCIES OF COURSE BUT IN

03:52:21.761 --> 03:52:23.529
NEUTRAL ENTITY WITH CLEAR

03:52:23.596 --> 03:52:25.931
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S NOT TIED

03:52:25.998 --> 03:52:27.500
TO A SPECIFIC SEGMENT.

03:52:27.566 --> 03:52:28.701
THE STRUCTURE WOULD ALSO SUPPORT

03:52:28.768 --> 03:52:30.236
EXPANDING THE DATA SYSTEM TO

03:52:30.303 --> 03:52:31.671
INCLUDE DATA FROM PRIVATE

03:52:31.737 --> 03:52:33.406
POSTSECONDARY HEALTH SOCIAL

03:52:33.472 --> 03:52:34.540
SERVICES.

03:52:34.607 --> 03:52:36.709
EARLY LEARNING OR OTHER AGENCIES

03:52:36.776 --> 03:52:38.644
OUTSIDE THE PUBLIC EDUCATION

03:52:38.711 --> 03:52:41.147
SYSTEMS AS YOU HEARD EXPRESSED A

03:52:41.213 --> 03:52:42.682
LOT OF INTEREST IN DOING.

03:52:42.748 --> 03:52:44.183
SO FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA HAS

03:52:44.250 --> 03:52:45.384
BEEN SITTING ON A LOT OF

03:52:45.451 --> 03:52:47.720
EDUCATION DATA WITH NO PUBLICLY

03:52:47.787 --> 03:52:49.555
AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE

03:52:49.622 --> 03:52:51.457
OUTCOMES OF ITS INVESTMENT

03:52:51.524 --> 03:52:53.326
ACROSS PUBLIC EDUCATION.

03:52:53.392 --> 03:52:55.194
THE STATE'S WELL POSITION NOW TO

03:52:55.261 --> 03:52:57.430
JOIN MANY OTHER STATES IN USING

03:52:57.496 --> 03:52:59.632
DATA WE ALREADY COLLECT. TO

03:52:59.699 --> 03:53:01.367
CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE

03:53:01.434 --> 03:53:03.402
SYSTEM THAT CN INFORM STUDENT

03:53:03.469 --> 03:53:05.271
DECISION MAKING SUPPORT SCHOOLS

03:53:05.338 --> 03:53:07.006
AND COLLEGES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO

03:53:07.073 --> 03:53:08.441
IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES.

03:53:08.507 --> 03:53:09.975
AND MEET THE GOVERNOR'S VISION

03:53:10.042 --> 03:53:11.510
OF USING DATA TO IMPROVE AND A

03:53:11.577 --> 03:53:12.845
LINE STATE EDUCATION AND

03:53:12.912 --> 03:53:14.747
WORKFORCE POLICIES I THINK WE

03:53:14.814 --> 03:53:16.749
SHOULD SEIZE THAT OPPORTUNITY

03:53:16.816 --> 03:53:17.950
I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH

03:53:18.017 --> 03:53:19.251
SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW SOME OTHER

03:53:19.318 --> 03:53:20.086
STATES.

03:53:20.152 --> 03:53:22.588
HAVE USED THEIR DATA SYSTEMS GO

03:53:22.655 --> 03:53:24.123
WE NEED TO GO WE NEED IS A

03:53:24.190 --> 03:53:25.191
CENTRAL [inaudible]

03:53:25.257 --> 03:53:27.860
OFFICE. TO TO MANAGE THIS THE

03:53:27.927 --> 03:53:29.729
THIS OPERATION EVEN WHETHER OR

03:53:29.795 --> 03:53:32.198
NOT THIS THE DATA COLLECTION IS

03:53:32.264 --> 03:53:34.333
CENTRALIZED OR WHETHER IT'S

03:53:34.400 --> 03:53:36.102
FEDERATED I I THINK YOU DO YES

03:53:36.168 --> 03:53:37.870
YOU NEED A GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE

03:53:37.937 --> 03:53:39.071
WHETHER YOU DECIDE ON A

03:53:39.138 --> 03:53:40.840
CENTRALIZED DATA.

03:53:40.906 --> 03:53:42.942
WAREHOUSE US RIGHT NOW SYSTEM OR

03:53:43.008 --> 03:53:45.177
A FEDERATED SYSTEM I THINK YOU

03:53:45.244 --> 03:53:47.179
WOULD STILL NEED A CENTRALIZED

03:53:47.246 --> 03:53:48.981
GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS TO

03:53:49.048 --> 03:53:50.249
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO DO THE

03:53:50.316 --> 03:53:51.484
COLLECTION WHETHER IT'S THE

03:53:51.550 --> 03:53:52.685
INITIAL COLLECTION OF THE

03:53:52.752 --> 03:53:55.321
COLLATION AND THEN SOMEBODY

03:53:55.388 --> 03:53:57.089
NEEDS TO MANAGE THE OUTPUT.

03:53:57.156 --> 03:53:57.890
YES.

03:53:57.957 --> 03:53:59.291
AS TO WHAT THE PRODUCT IS THAT

03:53:59.358 --> 03:54:00.893
YOU'RE DELIVERING AND WHO YOU'RE

03:54:00.960 --> 03:54:02.228
DELIVERING IT YES I COUNTY AS OF

03:54:02.294 --> 03:54:04.096
THE TIME I DID THERE THE

03:54:04.163 --> 03:54:05.898
RESEARCH --

03:54:05.965 --> 03:54:08.134
THAT I READ UP IN THE REPORTS.

03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:10.136
OF THE STATES THAT HAD.

03:54:10.202 --> 03:54:11.570
CROSS SECTOR DATA SYSTEMS.

03:54:11.637 --> 03:54:13.105
MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY CHOSE TO

03:54:13.172 --> 03:54:14.206
GO WITH A CENTRALIZED DATA

03:54:14.273 --> 03:54:15.574
WAREHOUSE RATHER THAN A

03:54:15.641 --> 03:54:17.309
FEDERATED SYSTEM THE NUMBER OF

03:54:17.376 --> 03:54:20.079
REASONS FOR THAT BUT THAT MOST

03:54:20.146 --> 03:54:21.447
OF THEM HAD TO DO WITH GREATER

03:54:21.514 --> 03:54:22.915
EFFICIENCY --

03:54:22.982 --> 03:54:24.784
THEY ACTUALLY GET USED MORE

03:54:24.850 --> 03:54:26.285
BECAUSE THE DATA ARE ALREADY

03:54:26.352 --> 03:54:27.853
MATCHED AND ALREADY SITTING

03:54:27.920 --> 03:54:29.355
TOGETHER IN A IN A WAREHOUSE

03:54:29.422 --> 03:54:31.424
MAKING IT MUCH EASIER TO ACCESS

03:54:31.490 --> 03:54:31.957
THEM -- YOU

03:54:32.024 --> 03:54:33.092
HEARD -- THE

03:54:33.159 --> 03:54:35.261
PEOPLE IN THE LAST PANEL TALK

03:54:35.327 --> 03:54:37.163
YOU PROCESS AND YOU KNOW EVERY

03:54:37.229 --> 03:54:38.464
TIME THEY WANT TO LIKE SHARE

03:54:38.531 --> 03:54:40.099
DATA FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE IS

03:54:40.166 --> 03:54:42.301
THIS LONG DRAWN OUT PROCESS OF

03:54:42.368 --> 03:54:44.970
GETTING APPROVAL AND AND USE AND

03:54:45.037 --> 03:54:46.305
THAT KIND OF THING SO IF YOU

03:54:46.372 --> 03:54:47.173
HAVE A CENTRALIZED DATA

03:54:47.239 --> 03:54:47.873
WAREHOUSE.

03:54:47.940 --> 03:54:49.208
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO

03:54:49.275 --> 03:54:51.277
HAVE A STRUCTURE AS PART OF YOUR

03:54:51.343 --> 03:54:53.212
GOVERNANCE WHERE.

03:54:53.279 --> 03:54:54.713
THERE IS DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE.

03:54:54.780 --> 03:54:57.116
ON HOW TO USE THE DATA EACH TIME

03:54:57.183 --> 03:54:58.818
YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT --

03:54:58.884 --> 03:55:01.086
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ALREADY THERE

03:55:01.153 --> 03:55:02.054
TOGETHER --

03:55:02.121 --> 03:55:03.689
SAID THAT OTHER STATES MORE

03:55:03.756 --> 03:55:05.357
OTHER STATES THAN NOT HAVE

03:55:05.424 --> 03:55:06.659
DECIDED TO GO WITH THAT.

03:55:06.725 --> 03:55:08.360
WELL MY LIMITED I. T. EXPERIENCE

03:55:08.427 --> 03:55:09.728
IN CALIFORNIA TELLS ME WHEN

03:55:09.795 --> 03:55:11.096
YOU'RE ATTEMPTING.

03:55:11.163 --> 03:55:12.798
TO CONNECT DISSIMILAR SYSTEMS

03:55:12.865 --> 03:55:13.799
THEY'RE ALWAYS CONNECTIVITY

03:55:13.866 --> 03:55:15.601
ISSUES AND THAT USUALLY IS VERY

03:55:15.668 --> 03:55:17.903
VERY EXPENSIVE TO SOLVE IF YOU

03:55:17.970 --> 03:55:18.871
EVER SOLVE IT.

03:55:18.938 --> 03:55:21.040
BUT WHAT ABOUT A BIGGER ISSUE

03:55:21.106 --> 03:55:25.978
WITH A FEDERATED SYSTEM AND IT

03:55:26.045 --> 03:55:26.545
WAS WITH.

03:55:26.612 --> 03:55:28.147
BUT OF COURSE ONE OF THE

03:55:28.214 --> 03:55:30.783
PANELISTS IN THE WAS --

03:55:30.850 --> 03:55:32.218
DOCTOR BROWN.

03:55:32.284 --> 03:55:33.719
SPOKE ABOUT YOU KNOW THERE'S

03:55:33.786 --> 03:55:34.620
CERTAIN DATA POINTS CERTAIN

03:55:34.687 --> 03:55:35.187
LEVEL OF INFORMATION THAT

03:55:35.254 --> 03:55:36.422
EVERYBODY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN

03:55:36.489 --> 03:55:39.091
HAVING AND THEN THERE'S PROBABLY

03:55:39.158 --> 03:55:40.893
OF SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER.

03:55:40.960 --> 03:55:43.095
DATA SET THAT WOULD BE UNIQUE TO

03:55:43.162 --> 03:55:44.430
THE UC OR THE C. ISSUE WITH A

03:55:44.497 --> 03:55:46.198
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO IT'S A

03:55:46.265 --> 03:55:47.733
CENTRALIZED STUFF.

03:55:47.800 --> 03:55:48.667
THERE WE NEED TO GET INTO A POT

03:55:48.734 --> 03:55:50.135
SOMEWHERE.

03:55:50.202 --> 03:55:52.605
EITHER FED THERE OR COLLECTED

03:55:52.671 --> 03:55:53.873
THERE INITIALLY RIGHT.

03:55:53.939 --> 03:55:55.374
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:55:55.441 --> 03:55:57.076
YES YES I MEAN I I CERTAINLY

03:55:57.142 --> 03:55:58.477
AGREE WITH HER THAT THERE ARE

03:55:58.544 --> 03:56:00.145
THAT YOU KNOW THE EACH SYSTEM

03:56:00.212 --> 03:56:00.379
OFFICE.

03:56:00.446 --> 03:56:01.580
COLLECTS.

03:56:01.647 --> 03:56:03.315
A SUBSET OF WHAT THE ACTUAL

03:56:03.382 --> 03:56:05.117
INSTITUTION TAP INSTITUTIONS

03:56:05.184 --> 03:56:06.986
HAVE MORE DATA THAN THEY SEND UP

03:56:07.052 --> 03:56:08.454
TO THEIR SYSTEM OFFICES I THINK

03:56:08.521 --> 03:56:09.688
SIMILARLY.

03:56:09.755 --> 03:56:10.589
THE SYSTEM OFFICES WOULD

03:56:10.656 --> 03:56:12.191
PROBABLY HAVE SOME PIECES OF

03:56:12.258 --> 03:56:13.726
INFORMATION IT WOULDN'T GET SENT

03:56:13.792 --> 03:56:15.427
UP TO ANY CENTRALIZED DATA

03:56:15.494 --> 03:56:16.829
WAREHOUSE JUST BECAUSE THEY

03:56:16.896 --> 03:56:18.063
WEREN'T NECESSARILY NEEDED.

03:56:18.130 --> 03:56:20.933
ROUTINELY TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS

03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:22.401
AND THAT SO YOU COULD HAVE SORT

03:56:22.468 --> 03:56:25.204
OF UP A MIX OF THINGS A LOT AND

03:56:25.271 --> 03:56:26.505
SOME STATES HAVE THAT WHERE THEY

03:56:26.572 --> 03:56:27.873
HAVE A CENTRALIZED.

03:56:27.940 --> 03:56:30.976
DATA WAREHOUSE FOR A SUBSET OF

03:56:31.043 --> 03:56:32.144
OF PIECES OF INFORMATION AND

03:56:32.211 --> 03:56:33.445
THEN IF YOU WANT SOME OTHER

03:56:33.512 --> 03:56:34.980
INFORMATION THEN YOU GO OUT AND

03:56:35.047 --> 03:56:36.615
YOU ASK THE SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE

03:56:36.682 --> 03:56:38.050
THAT OR THEY HAVE A CENTRALIZED

03:56:38.117 --> 03:56:40.452
DATA WAREHOUSE FOR EDUCATION

03:56:40.519 --> 03:56:41.253
DATA.

03:56:41.320 --> 03:56:43.088
BUT THEY HAVE A FEDERATED SYSTEM

03:56:43.155 --> 03:56:44.857
WITH SAY SOCIAL SERVICES OUR

03:56:44.924 --> 03:56:47.927
CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORK ONLY IFTHEY NEED IT DO THEY GO OUT AND

03:56:47.993 --> 03:56:49.828
DO A MATCH AND GET RECORDS FOR

03:56:49.895 --> 03:56:51.096
THE PURPOSE THEY NEED.

03:56:51.163 --> 03:56:53.365
I THOUGHT THE COST THE COST --

03:56:53.432 --> 03:56:54.667
INFORMATION DETAILS IN YOUR

03:56:54.733 --> 03:56:57.603
COURSES LOW.

03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:59.471
I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT TO BE

03:56:59.538 --> 03:57:00.706
MUCH HIGHER WELL THERE IS THAT I

03:57:00.773 --> 03:57:02.508
DID NOT DO AN IN DEPTH COST

03:57:02.575 --> 03:57:04.310
ANALYSIS SO I WOULD CAUTION YOU

03:57:04.376 --> 03:57:05.945
AGAINST THAT WHAT I DID DO IS IN

03:57:06.011 --> 03:57:07.513
ALL OF MY INTERVIEWS I ASKED

03:57:07.580 --> 03:57:09.281
PEOPLE ABOUT NATIONAL EXPERTS

03:57:09.348 --> 03:57:10.683
PEOPLE IN OTHER STATES TO GIVE.

03:57:10.749 --> 03:57:12.551
ME ESTIMATES ON LIKE WHAT WOULD

03:57:12.618 --> 03:57:15.020
IT COST TO DO THIS PEOPLE JUST

03:57:15.087 --> 03:57:17.823
KIND OF ROUTINELY FORMED AROUND

03:57:17.890 --> 03:57:19.124
DAY I THINK IT WOULD COST

03:57:19.191 --> 03:57:20.593
CALIFORNIA TWO OR THREE MILLION

03:57:20.659 --> 03:57:23.062
DOLLARS A YEAR. TO HAVE A SYSTEM

03:57:23.128 --> 03:57:24.163
AGAIN.

03:57:24.229 --> 03:57:25.230
YOU KNOW AND I AND I DID A BACK

03:57:25.297 --> 03:57:27.533
OF THE ENVELOPE LIKE WHEN DID

03:57:27.600 --> 03:57:29.001
SEE PAC COST NOT THAT THEY DID

03:57:29.068 --> 03:57:30.970
EXACTLY THE SAME THING AS THIS

03:57:31.036 --> 03:57:31.737
BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT.

03:57:31.804 --> 03:57:33.472
COMES IN IF YOU INFLATE THEIR

03:57:33.539 --> 03:57:35.174
COSTS TO NOW SOMEWHERE IN THE

03:57:35.240 --> 03:57:35.741
TWO TO THREE MILLION DOLLAR

03:57:35.808 --> 03:57:36.342
RANGE.

03:57:36.408 --> 03:57:37.943
BUT AGAIN THAT WOULD DEPEND ON

03:57:38.010 --> 03:57:41.046
HOW MUCH YOU WANTED TO RESOURCE

03:57:41.113 --> 03:57:42.114
IT.

03:57:42.181 --> 03:57:44.550
pTHAT'S NOT LIKE THE INITIAL

03:57:44.617 --> 03:57:46.218
COSTS TO PAY YOU KNOW ALL THE

03:57:46.285 --> 03:57:47.620
SYSTEMS TO LIKE BE INVOLVED IN

03:57:47.686 --> 03:57:48.887
FIGURING OUT WHAT ARE WE

03:57:48.954 --> 03:57:50.155
ACTUALLY GOING TO DO HERE AND

03:57:50.222 --> 03:57:51.357
WHAT PIECES OF DATA ARE GOING TO

03:57:51.423 --> 03:57:52.558
GO IN IT AND HOW DO WE DEVELOP

03:57:52.625 --> 03:57:53.425
OUR PRIVACY.

03:57:53.492 --> 03:57:55.260
AND SECURITY PROTOCOLS AND ALL

03:57:55.327 --> 03:57:56.462
OF THAT KIND OF STUFF THAT'S AN

03:57:56.528 --> 03:57:57.997
INITIAL COST BUT IT'S AN

03:57:58.063 --> 03:57:59.164
IMPORTANT VERY VERY IMPORTANT

03:57:59.231 --> 03:58:00.532
ISSUE I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW WE

03:58:00.599 --> 03:58:02.434
MEASURE.

03:58:02.501 --> 03:58:04.603
AND EVALUATE WHAT WE DO.

03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:05.871
ACROSS THE BOARD AND AT THE END

03:58:05.938 --> 03:58:08.307
WE DON'T HAVE DATA TO PERMIT THE

03:58:08.374 --> 03:58:09.575
ANALYSIS TO HELP SO.

03:58:09.642 --> 03:58:11.110
RIGHT VERY INTERESTING

03:58:11.176 --> 03:58:11.410
[inaudible]

03:58:11.477 --> 03:58:13.112
THANK YOU [inaudible]

03:58:13.178 --> 03:58:14.913
MA'AM.

03:58:14.980 --> 03:58:16.548
I'M GOOD AFTERNOON --

03:58:16.615 --> 03:58:17.483
AGAIN MY NAME IS VALERIE LINDSAY

03:58:17.549 --> 03:58:18.717
WAGNER AND I'M HERE WITH --

03:58:18.784 --> 03:58:21.153
CALIFORNIA COMPETES I'M A SENIOR

03:58:21.220 --> 03:58:22.221
ANALYST THERE --

03:58:22.287 --> 03:58:24.723
APPRECIATE BEING INVITED --

03:58:24.790 --> 03:58:26.325

AND I APPRECIATE THAT FINANCE

03:58:29.128 --> 03:58:33.032
AND SENDING --

03:58:33.098 --> 03:58:34.166
CALIFORNIA COMPETES WAS

03:58:34.233 --> 03:58:35.934
ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN

03:58:36.001 --> 03:58:36.869
RECOGNIZING THAT HIGHER

03:58:36.935 --> 03:58:38.971
EDUCATION CAN BE BOTH AN

03:58:39.038 --> 03:58:40.673
ANTIDOTE AND A VACCINE. TO

03:58:40.739 --> 03:58:41.907
INCOME INEQUALITY WE ARE AN

03:58:41.974 --> 03:58:44.109
INDEPENDENT NONPARTISAN

03:58:44.176 --> 03:58:45.077
NONPROFIT.

03:58:45.144 --> 03:58:46.679
ODJICK THAT FOCUSES ON MAKING

03:58:46.745 --> 03:58:48.147
THE ECONOMIC IN EQUITY DRIVEN

03:58:48.213 --> 03:58:49.448
CASE FOR INCREASING DEGREE

03:58:49.515 --> 03:58:52.251
ATTAINMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:58:52.317 --> 03:58:53.385
TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE

03:58:53.452 --> 03:58:54.653
NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WITH A

03:58:54.720 --> 03:58:55.320
POST SECONDARY DEGREE OR

03:58:55.387 --> 03:58:56.955
CERTIFICATE OUR STATE NEEDS A

03:58:57.022 --> 03:58:58.791
STRONGER GRASP OF NOT ONLY WHAT

03:58:58.857 --> 03:59:00.025
STUDENTS EXPERIENCES ARE IN

03:59:00.092 --> 03:59:02.161
HIGHER ED.

03:59:02.227 --> 03:59:03.095
BUT THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH EARLY

03:59:03.162 --> 03:59:05.397
A. K. TWELVE AND THE WORK FORCE

03:59:05.464 --> 03:59:07.132
WE'RE EXCITED FOR CALIFORNIA TO

03:59:07.199 --> 03:59:08.133
CATCH UP WITH THE PROGRESS THAT

03:59:08.200 --> 03:59:09.668
MANY OTHER STATES HAVE MADE BY

03:59:09.735 --> 03:59:11.870
MORE SYSTEMATICALLY INTEGRATING.

03:59:11.937 --> 03:59:12.805
DATA TO BETTER SERVE

03:59:12.871 --> 03:59:15.207
POLICYMAKERS THE PUBLIC AND

03:59:15.274 --> 03:59:18.510
STUDENTS BOTH YOUTH AND ADULTS.

03:59:18.577 --> 03:59:19.645
I'LL START BY SHARING A LITTLE

03:59:19.712 --> 03:59:20.946
BIT ABOUT WHAT I THINK IN

03:59:21.013 --> 03:59:22.648
EDUCATION WORK AND WORK FORCE OR

03:59:22.715 --> 03:59:24.249
P. WORKFORCE THE TO SYSTEM

03:59:24.316 --> 03:59:26.118
SHOULD DO IN CALIFORNIA AND WHY

03:59:26.185 --> 03:59:26.885
ONE IS NEEDED.

03:59:26.952 --> 03:59:27.753
HOPEFULLY ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR

03:59:27.820 --> 03:59:29.154
EARLIER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE

03:59:29.221 --> 03:59:31.924
COULD GET IF WE HAD THE SYSTEM --

03:59:31.990 --> 03:59:33.125
AND THEN I'LL CLOSE WITH

03:59:33.192 --> 03:59:34.326
DESCRIBING SOME.

03:59:34.393 --> 03:59:35.661
OF WHAT I THINK WE BELIEVE OUR

03:59:35.728 --> 03:59:37.863
NEAR TERM IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

03:59:37.930 --> 03:59:39.498
THAT CAN SET THE STATE ON A PATH

03:59:39.565 --> 03:59:41.100
FOR EFFECTIVENESS COST SAVINGS

03:59:41.166 --> 03:59:43.802
AND ULTIMATELY INDIVIDUAL AND

03:59:43.869 --> 03:59:45.771
SHARED PROSPERITY.

03:59:45.838 --> 03:59:48.240
SO A P. WORKFORCE DATA SYSTEM I

03:59:48.307 --> 03:59:49.908
THINK CONCEPTUALLY SHOULD DO

03:59:49.975 --> 03:59:51.877
FOUR THINGS ONE DRIVE IN SUPPORT

03:59:51.944 --> 03:59:53.679
STATE LEVEL EDUCATION AND

03:59:53.746 --> 03:59:55.714
ECONOMIC GOALS. TO CONNECT

03:59:55.781 --> 03:59:57.983
EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DATA AT

03:59:58.050 --> 03:59:59.618
THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL.

03:59:59.685 --> 04:00:01.320
IRV AS THE PRIMARY REPOSITORY

04:00:01.386 --> 04:00:03.188
FOR UP TO DATE AND HISTORICAL

04:00:03.255 --> 04:00:04.923
EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DATA.

04:00:04.990 --> 04:00:06.024
AND OVERCOME HISTORICAL

04:00:06.091 --> 04:00:07.493
INDEPENDENCE CHALLENGES THAT

04:00:07.559 --> 04:00:09.428
LIMIT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO USE

04:00:09.495 --> 04:00:11.363
EXISTING DATA.

04:00:11.430 --> 04:00:13.398
THERE ARE FEW WIDELY AGREED UPON

04:00:13.465 --> 04:00:14.700
CONSIDERATIONS THAT EMPATH.

04:00:14.767 --> 04:00:16.301
EMPHASIZE WHY THE STATE'S

04:00:16.368 --> 04:00:18.103
CURRENT DATA COLLECTION AND

04:00:18.170 --> 04:00:19.238
REPORTING NOTHING METHODS ARE

04:00:19.304 --> 04:00:20.739
INADEQUATE --

04:00:20.806 --> 04:00:22.007
I APPRECIATE WHAT ALL MY

04:00:22.074 --> 04:00:23.342
COLLEAGUES OF SAY IN IN GENERAL

04:00:23.408 --> 04:00:24.877
SORT OF WE SUPPORT THEM I THINK

04:00:24.943 --> 04:00:25.911
WE HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

04:00:25.978 --> 04:00:26.979
TAKE ON THEM.

04:00:27.045 --> 04:00:28.280
SO I THINK FIRST THE LACK OF

04:00:28.347 --> 04:00:31.116
COORDINATION LANDSCAPE IS KEY

04:00:31.183 --> 04:00:32.885
AND THAT REALLY CAME UP I THINK

04:00:32.951 --> 04:00:33.252
IN THIS LAST --

04:00:33.318 --> 04:00:34.620
PANEL.

04:00:34.686 --> 04:00:36.555
AS COLIN NOTED AS DETAILED IN

04:00:36.622 --> 04:00:38.357
YOUR AGENDA FOR THIS HEARING WE

04:00:38.423 --> 04:00:40.626
SAW CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC ENTITIES

04:00:40.692 --> 04:00:42.227
MAINTAIN THEIR OWN DATA SYSTEMS

04:00:42.294 --> 04:00:43.962
PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES

04:00:44.029 --> 04:00:45.631
MAINTAIN THEIR OWN DATA SYSTEMS

04:00:45.697 --> 04:00:48.100
AS THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION --

04:00:48.167 --> 04:00:49.668
AS DOES THE EMPLOYMENT

04:00:49.735 --> 04:00:51.069
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT RATE.

04:00:51.136 --> 04:00:52.638
THE WHILE EACH INDEPENDENT EACH

04:00:52.704 --> 04:00:54.573
ENTITY INDEPENDENTLY HOLDS RICH

04:00:54.640 --> 04:00:56.208
DATA I THINK IT'S CALLING

04:00:56.275 --> 04:00:56.809
SUGGESTED --

04:00:56.875 --> 04:00:58.577
IN HER SORT OF OPENING RIGHT

04:00:58.644 --> 04:00:59.311
THERE ARE SOME GOOD THINGS

04:00:59.378 --> 04:01:01.046
HAPPENING THIS SEGMENTED

04:01:01.113 --> 04:01:02.881
APPROACH LIMITS UNDERSTANDING OF

04:01:02.948 --> 04:01:04.683
HOW THE EDUCATION AND WORK FOR

04:01:04.750 --> 04:01:06.418
SYSTEMS COMPLEMENT EACH OHER.

04:01:06.485 --> 04:01:07.619
AND REALLY WHAT THAT DOES IS IT

04:01:07.686 --> 04:01:10.522
REDUCES POLICY MAKERS ABILITY TO

04:01:10.589 --> 04:01:12.090
MAKE FACT BASED DECISIONS.

04:01:12.157 --> 04:01:14.092
AND PREVENT STUDENTS FROM BEING

04:01:14.159 --> 04:01:15.661
INFORMED CONSUMERS.

04:01:15.727 --> 04:01:17.329
SECOND THE CAPACITY IN COSTS

04:01:17.396 --> 04:01:18.764
REQUIRED TO CONNECT THE SILO

04:01:18.831 --> 04:01:20.165
DATA ARE WHAT I WOULD CALL HER

04:01:20.232 --> 04:01:21.867
TO LEAN.

04:01:21.934 --> 04:01:23.202
I'M COLLEEN TALKED ABOUT THE

04:01:23.268 --> 04:01:24.102
NATIONAL STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE

04:01:24.169 --> 04:01:25.971
AND THAT'S CERTAINLY AN

04:01:26.038 --> 04:01:27.739
IMPORTANT PLACE WHERE LOTS THEY

04:01:27.806 --> 04:01:28.273
GET A LOT OF BUSINESS FROM

04:01:28.340 --> 04:01:29.641
CALIFORNIA.

04:01:29.708 --> 04:01:31.076
THE STATE SPENDS TENS OF

04:01:31.143 --> 04:01:33.545
MILLIONS EACH YEAR TO DIRECTLY

04:01:33.612 --> 04:01:35.314
AND INDIRECTLY SUPPORT MARY A

04:01:35.380 --> 04:01:36.682
DATA SYSTEMS AND I'M GONNA ALSO

04:01:36.748 --> 04:01:40.052
THROWING PORTALS AND DASHBOARDS --

04:01:40.118 --> 04:01:41.320
ONLY SOME OF WHICH ARE EVEN

04:01:41.386 --> 04:01:42.454
PRESENTED IN THAT AGENDA TODAY

04:01:42.521 --> 04:01:42.754
[inaudible]

04:01:42.821 --> 04:01:45.157
THERE'S MORE.

04:01:45.224 --> 04:01:47.860
MY THIRD POINT CENTERS ON EQUITY.

04:01:47.926 --> 04:01:49.528
SO THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS.

04:01:49.595 --> 04:01:51.263
YOU KNOW VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

04:01:51.330 --> 04:01:52.898
AND SOME EVEN MORE SO LIKE THAN

04:01:52.965 --> 04:01:54.333
WHAT I THINK PEOPLE GENERALLY

04:01:54.399 --> 04:01:55.467
START WITH.

04:01:55.534 --> 04:01:57.603
IS LIKE A FACT THE STATE NEEDS

04:01:57.669 --> 04:01:58.937
DATA ON WHERE STUDENTS AND

04:01:59.004 --> 04:02:00.873
WORKERS ARE STRUGGLING AND WHICH

04:02:00.939 --> 04:02:02.407
INVESTMENTS CAN ALLEVIATE THE

04:02:02.474 --> 04:02:04.643
STRUGGLES AND MAXIMIZE SUCCESS.

04:02:04.710 --> 04:02:06.578
THE ABSENCE OF AN INDEPENDENT

04:02:06.645 --> 04:02:08.113
DATA SYSTEM PREVENTS

04:02:08.180 --> 04:02:09.381
COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF

04:02:09.448 --> 04:02:10.716
OPPORTUNITY.

04:02:10.782 --> 04:02:12.484
PROGRESS MONITORING AND INFORMED

04:02:12.551 --> 04:02:14.019
DECISION MAKING.

04:02:14.086 --> 04:02:15.320
IN FACT THE STATE'S MAJOR

04:02:15.387 --> 04:02:17.289
INVESTMENTS AND CROSS SECTOR AND

04:02:17.356 --> 04:02:18.423
CROSS ARMS.

04:02:18.490 --> 04:02:20.859
SECTOR IN SEGMENT COLLABORATION

04:02:20.926 --> 04:02:23.095
OF SUCH A SYSTEM IN A PREVIOUS

04:02:23.161 --> 04:02:25.597
ROLE A LEAD SOME RESEARCH --

04:02:25.664 --> 04:02:26.231
ON THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S

04:02:26.298 --> 04:02:29.001
CAREER PATH FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

04:02:29.067 --> 04:02:30.535
DOLLARS AND THEN THE COMMUNITY

04:02:30.602 --> 04:02:31.570
COLLEGE CANCERS OFFICE STRONG

04:02:31.637 --> 04:02:33.538
WORK FORCE PROGRAM.

04:02:33.605 --> 04:02:35.073
EACH REGION.

04:02:35.140 --> 04:02:36.275
CONSIDER DEVELOPING THEIR OWN

04:02:36.341 --> 04:02:38.310
NEW REGIONAL DATA SYSTEM AND ALL

04:02:38.377 --> 04:02:40.712
HAD THE SAME STRUGGLES SUCH AS

04:02:40.779 --> 04:02:43.048
WHICH DATA SYSTEMS ARE THE BEST.

04:02:43.115 --> 04:02:43.815
FOR UNDERSTANDING REGIONAL

04:02:43.882 --> 04:02:45.751
PATHWAYS WHO HAD ACCESS TO THOSE

04:02:45.817 --> 04:02:48.453
DATA AND OF THOSE WITH ACCESS.

04:02:48.520 --> 04:02:51.290
WHO ALSO HAD THE CAPACITY IN THE

04:02:51.356 --> 04:02:53.225
INTERPRETERS DATA?

04:02:53.292 --> 04:02:55.060
THEIR PROGRESS VERY BASED ON

04:02:55.127 --> 04:02:57.029
LARGELY ON RESOURCES AND THAT

04:02:57.095 --> 04:02:58.697
ALONE I BELIEVE SHOULD NOT

04:02:58.764 --> 04:03:00.632
DETERMINE HOW I'M LEADERS ARE

04:03:00.699 --> 04:03:02.301
INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO USE

04:03:02.367 --> 04:03:03.435
INFORMATION.

04:03:03.502 --> 04:03:05.370
A P. WORKFORCE DATA SYSTEM COULD

04:03:05.437 --> 04:03:07.172
HELP DEMOCRATIZE HOW DID ARE

04:03:07.239 --> 04:03:08.974
ACCESSED AND USED BY VARIOUS

04:03:09.041 --> 04:03:12.010
STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING STUDENTS.

04:03:12.077 --> 04:03:13.645
THE GIVEN THIS INFORMATION WHERE

04:03:13.712 --> 04:03:15.147
DOES THE STATE GO FROM HERE.

04:03:15.213 --> 04:03:16.214
FIRST AND FOREMOST THE STATE

04:03:16.281 --> 04:03:17.883
MUST DECIDE ON SOME FUNDAMENTALS

04:03:17.950 --> 04:03:19.051
THAT I THINK.

04:03:19.117 --> 04:03:20.152
MY COLLEAGUES.

04:03:20.218 --> 04:03:22.387
MOST OF THE SECOND ISSUE TODAY

04:03:22.454 --> 04:03:23.689
THAT WE'VE COVERED --

04:03:23.755 --> 04:03:25.490
HAVE MENTIONED SO WHAT WILL THE

04:03:25.557 --> 04:03:27.492
SYSTEM BE USED.

04:03:27.559 --> 04:03:28.427
FOR WHAT WILL THIS HOW WILL THE

04:03:28.493 --> 04:03:30.128
STATE LOOK DIFFERENT AFTER WE

04:03:30.195 --> 04:03:31.997
HAVE THE SYSTEM.

04:03:32.064 --> 04:03:33.999
WHICH SECTORS WILL BE INVOLVED.

04:03:34.066 --> 04:03:35.067
WHO WOULD BE THE CONSUMERS OF

04:03:35.133 --> 04:03:36.835
THESE DATA?

04:03:36.902 --> 04:03:37.903
THE NEXT STEP IS TO RESEARCH

04:03:37.970 --> 04:03:39.504
DATA POLICIES AND PRACTICES

04:03:39.571 --> 04:03:41.306
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN

04:03:41.373 --> 04:03:43.141
OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS HOW POLICY

04:03:43.208 --> 04:03:45.277
HAS BEEN USED TO FRAME PLAN.

04:03:45.344 --> 04:03:47.212
AND IMPLEMENT P. WORKFORCE DATA

04:03:47.279 --> 04:03:49.214
SYSTEMS ACROSS THE NATION.

04:03:49.281 --> 04:03:50.682
I PROVIDED YOU WITH THE HAND OUT

04:03:50.749 --> 04:03:52.250
ATTACHMENT A THAT YOU COULD LOOK

04:03:52.317 --> 04:03:54.786
AT T COMPARES IT REALLY JUST

04:03:54.853 --> 04:03:56.621
SUMMARIZES VERY BRIEFLY --

04:03:56.688 --> 04:03:59.791
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MARYLAND

04:03:59.858 --> 04:04:00.826
KENTUCKY --

04:04:00.892 --> 04:04:03.562
IN WASHINGTON STATE.

04:04:03.628 --> 04:04:04.830
UNDERSTANDING THE WORK OF OTHER

04:04:04.896 --> 04:04:06.732
STATE AND IMPORTANTLY HOW THAT

04:04:06.798 --> 04:04:08.266
WORK CAN BE APPLIED TO OUR

04:04:08.333 --> 04:04:10.302
POLICY CONTEXT IS CRITICAL THE

04:04:10.369 --> 04:04:12.371
TYPE OF POLICY LETTERS I THINK

04:04:12.437 --> 04:04:14.506
WE SORT OF HIGHLIGHT --

04:04:14.573 --> 04:04:15.774
ON THAT DOCUMENT.

04:04:15.841 --> 04:04:16.975
AND THIS BRINGS US REALLY TO MY

04:04:17.042 --> 04:04:18.143
NEXT RECOMMENDATION THE STATE

04:04:18.210 --> 04:04:19.644
SHOULD PLAN TO DEVELOP THE

04:04:19.711 --> 04:04:22.347
CENTRAL DEPOSITORY REPOSITORY

04:04:22.414 --> 04:04:23.382
FOR DATA.

04:04:23.448 --> 04:04:24.883
THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS PORTALS AND

04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:26.651
DASHBOARDS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS

04:04:26.718 --> 04:04:29.154
WORKERS RESEARCHERS AND LEADERS

04:04:29.221 --> 04:04:30.856
IS A LITTLE BIT MIND BOGGLING.

04:04:30.922 --> 04:04:32.524
A CENTRALIZED REPOSITORY WOULD

04:04:32.591 --> 04:04:34.059
BE MORE WOULD MORE EQUITABLY

04:04:34.126 --> 04:04:35.761
PROVIDE STAKEHOLDERS WITH ACCESS

04:04:35.827 --> 04:04:37.729
TO CONSISTENT AND COMPREHENSIVE

04:04:37.796 --> 04:04:38.897
INFORMATION.

04:04:38.964 --> 04:04:40.165
IT WOULD ALSO HELP LEVEL THE

04:04:40.232 --> 04:04:43.301
PLAYING FIELD SIX AND REALITIES

04:04:43.368 --> 04:04:47.072
OF WHAT WE CALL ZIP CODE DESTINY.

04:04:47.139 --> 04:04:48.140
FINALLY THE QUESTION OF WHERE

04:04:48.206 --> 04:04:49.141
THIS -- P.

04:04:49.207 --> 04:04:50.275
WORK FIRST DATA SYSTEM SHOULD BE

04:04:50.342 --> 04:04:51.877
HOUSE IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THIS

04:04:51.943 --> 04:04:53.512
ISSUE OF COORDINATION. TO GAIN

04:04:53.578 --> 04:04:54.713
TRUST IN BY IN OF ALL

04:04:54.780 --> 04:04:55.981
PARTICIPANTS THE STATE MUST

04:04:56.048 --> 04:04:57.449
STORE THE DATA IN A WAY THAT IS

04:04:57.516 --> 04:04:59.484
POLITICALLY NEUTRAL SECURE AND

04:04:59.551 --> 04:05:01.186
ENSURE THE BALANCE OF POWER IN

04:05:01.253 --> 04:05:04.089
ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATE'S GOALS.

04:05:04.156 --> 04:05:05.690
WE ARE GLAD THAT THERE ARE OTHER

04:05:05.757 --> 04:05:07.325
POLICY CONVERSATIONS UNDER WAY

04:05:07.392 --> 04:05:08.927
TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT

04:05:08.994 --> 04:05:10.829
AGENCY THAT COULD OVERSEE DATA

04:05:10.896 --> 04:05:12.898
AS ITS MAIN CHARGE.

04:05:12.964 --> 04:05:14.032
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I THINK

04:05:14.099 --> 04:05:15.534
THAT YOU SORT OF ASKED WHAT WHAT

04:05:15.600 --> 04:05:17.502
WHAT DO WE GET OUT OF THIS THOSE.

04:05:17.569 --> 04:05:19.004
QUESTIONS WE COULD PROBABLY

04:05:19.071 --> 04:05:20.806
ANSWER ARE HOW MANY HIGH SCHOOL

04:05:20.872 --> 04:05:22.908
GRADUATES ENROLLED IN COLLEGE

04:05:22.974 --> 04:05:23.642
THE NEXT FALL.

04:05:23.708 --> 04:05:25.944
WE DON'T KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW.

04:05:26.011 --> 04:05:27.245
HOW MANY OF THE STUDENTS GOING

04:05:27.312 --> 04:05:28.980
TO COMPLETE COLLEGE?

04:05:29.047 --> 04:05:31.750
WE ARE NOT THAT RIGHT NOW.

04:05:31.817 --> 04:05:33.151
HOW DO JOB PLACEMENT RATES AND

04:05:33.218 --> 04:05:35.120
WAGES LOOK ACROSS INSTITUTIONS

04:05:35.187 --> 04:05:37.289
IN MAJORS?

04:05:37.355 --> 04:05:38.757
WATER WORKFORCE OUTCOMES FOR

04:05:38.824 --> 04:05:39.958
STUDENTS DEPENDING ON THEIR TIME

04:05:40.025 --> 04:05:42.494
TO DEGREE.

04:05:42.561 --> 04:05:43.862
THOSE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES

04:05:43.929 --> 04:05:45.130
BUT REALLY IN CLOSING I'D LIKE

04:05:45.197 --> 04:05:46.431
TO SUGGEST WHAT.

04:05:46.498 --> 04:05:47.599
WE BELIEVE ARE CRITICAL SERVE

04:05:47.666 --> 04:05:49.801
NEAR TERM IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

04:05:49.868 --> 04:05:51.369
THE FIRST THE STATE COULD MAP

04:05:51.436 --> 04:05:53.138
OUT EXISTING DATA INFRASTRUCTURE

04:05:53.205 --> 04:05:54.873
IDENTIFYING WHICH SYSTEMS ARE IN

04:05:54.940 --> 04:05:56.408
USE WHERE THERE ARE GAPS IN WITH

04:05:56.475 --> 04:05:58.577
SCALING UP STATEWIDE MEANS.

04:05:58.643 --> 04:05:59.911
MAPPING CAN CLARIFY AND HELP

04:05:59.978 --> 04:06:01.780
ENSURE THAT THE DATA SYSTEM

04:06:01.847 --> 04:06:03.215
GOALS ARE MET.

04:06:03.281 --> 04:06:04.216
THE STATE SHOULD IDENTIFY THE

04:06:04.282 --> 04:06:05.684
DEED IN METRICS NEED TO MEET

04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:07.052
SYSTEM GOALS.

04:06:07.119 --> 04:06:08.553
WE SHOULD ALSO DETERMINE WHO

04:06:08.620 --> 04:06:09.721
WILL COMPRISE THE COMMITTEE

04:06:09.788 --> 04:06:10.989
CHARGED WITH PLANNING AND

04:06:11.056 --> 04:06:12.390
LAUNCHING THE DATA SYSTEM.

04:06:12.457 --> 04:06:14.292
SEVERAL ENTITIES.

04:06:14.359 --> 04:06:15.861
WANT TO AND PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE

04:06:15.927 --> 04:06:18.530
A VOICE IT INDEPENDENCE IS KEY

04:06:18.597 --> 04:06:20.232
TO ENSURING A SENT A STUDENT

04:06:20.298 --> 04:06:21.533
CENTERED APPROACH.

04:06:21.600 --> 04:06:22.667
FINALLY THE STATE SHOULD

04:06:22.734 --> 04:06:24.703
CONSIDER MORE THAN ONE PROTOTYPE

04:06:24.769 --> 04:06:26.204
OF THE P. WORK FOR SYSTEM.

04:06:26.271 --> 04:06:27.439
THESE PROTOTYPE SHOULD ADDRESS

04:06:27.506 --> 04:06:28.740
HOW DATA WOULD FLOW FROM THE

04:06:28.807 --> 04:06:31.443
LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL AND BACK.

04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:32.978
EVERYBODY GET SOMETHING AND

04:06:33.044 --> 04:06:34.779
IDENTIFY INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED

04:06:34.846 --> 04:06:36.281
TO CONNECT TO OTHER STATE AGENCY

04:06:36.348 --> 04:06:37.649
DATA.

04:06:37.716 --> 04:06:38.717
OF COURSE IT SHOULD ALSO

04:06:38.783 --> 04:06:40.018
DELINEATE COSTS --

04:06:40.085 --> 04:06:41.553
ON BECAUSE I THINK ONE THING

04:06:41.620 --> 04:06:43.054
THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT.

04:06:43.121 --> 04:06:45.323
IS REALLY ABOUT UNDERSTANDING

04:06:45.390 --> 04:06:47.125
THE BIG PICTURE AND WHAT WE WANT.

04:06:47.192 --> 04:06:49.461
RIGHT IF I WANNA GO GET A CAR.

04:06:49.528 --> 04:06:51.329
I COULD GET IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

04:06:51.396 --> 04:06:52.731
SEVEN HONDA CIVIC OR I COULD GET

04:06:52.797 --> 04:06:54.699
A TESLA RATE SO DECIDING COST A

04:06:54.766 --> 04:06:56.301
FRIEND I THINK SOMETIMES CAN BE

04:06:56.368 --> 04:06:57.602
A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE FOR NOT

04:06:57.669 --> 04:06:59.504
REALLY CLEAR ON WHAT IT IS WE

04:06:59.571 --> 04:07:00.438
THINK WE WANT.

04:07:00.505 --> 04:07:01.973
FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S AN EXCITING

04:07:02.040 --> 04:07:04.442
TIME. TO CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL

04:07:04.509 --> 04:07:05.911
OF A P. WORK FIRST DATA SYSTEM

04:07:05.977 --> 04:07:07.212
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE EAGER

EXPERTISE AS YOU REFINE A

04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:13.652
STRATEGY THAT MORE EQUITABLY

04:07:13.718 --> 04:07:15.020
EXPANDS OPPORTUNITIES FOR

04:07:15.086 --> 04:07:16.655
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.

04:07:16.721 --> 04:07:17.756
AS WELL AS FAR STATES BROADER

04:07:17.822 --> 04:07:20.358

DOES CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THAT

04:07:38.810 --> 04:07:40.245
IN ORDER FOR THIS DATA SYSTEM TO
