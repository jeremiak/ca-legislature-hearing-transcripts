00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:36.882
THREE WHICH I THINK IS

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:42.054
IMPORTANT AS WELL TO ENSURE.

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:42.555

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:51.163
PROBLEMS WITH CDC ARE I DON'T

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:55.401
THINK THAT'S- AS A SURPRISE TO

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:58.904
ANYONE. AND CREATING THESE

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:02.208
KINDS OF- COLLABORATIONS WHERE

00:14:02.274 --> 00:14:06.512
CDCR INTO BECOMING AN ADJUNCT-

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:10.149
EDT AGENCY IS CONCERNING FOR ME

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:12.318
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE NOT A FEW

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:17.156
MONTHS AGO CDCR- LISTED SOMEONE

00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:18.857
IS BEING PRESENT AND ALIVE WHO

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:20.593
HAD BEEN DECAPITATED IN THE

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:22.561
CELL FOR MULTIPLE MULTIPLE

00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:25.497
HOURS AND SO OFFICIALLY BE THAT

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:28.033
CAN'T EVEN. ACCURATELY IDENTIFY

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.769
SOMEONE AS BEING ALIVE OR NOT

00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:31.837
TO THEN ASK THEM TO TAKE ON

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:33.939
ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:35.274
LIKE SIFTING THROUGH THIS KIND

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:37.376
OF INFORMATION- IS REALLY

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:38.944
CONCERNING TO ME JUST BECAUSE I

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:39.878
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE

00:14:39.945 --> 00:14:42.147
APPROPRIATE CHECKS AND BALANCES

00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:45.150
IN- CDC. AND I'M MUCH MORE

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:46.385
INTERESTED IN FIGURING OUT HOW

00:14:46.452 --> 00:14:48.387
WE CAN HAVE EDT DO ITS JOB

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:50.623
PROPERLY RATHER THAN ATTACHING

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:53.859
IT TO ALL OF THESE OTHER-

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:58.497
DEPARTMENTS. IN AN EFFORT- TO

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.466
MAKE SURE THAT CLAIMS GET OUT-

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:01.900
THAT ARE LEGITIMATE TO THOSE

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:03.602
PEOPLE WHO DESERVE IT. AND I

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:04.903
ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.305
FALSE NARRATIVE THAT MOST OF

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:07.673
THE FOLKS WHO STOLE MONEY WHERE

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.208

JUST PULLED UP AN ARTICLE- THAT

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:38.904
IT BUT WE HAVE ALLOWED THIS

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:40.906
NARRATIVE. TO COME OUT AND

00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:42.574
SPREAD THAT SAYS ALL THE FOLKS

00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:43.742
WHO ARE INSIDE WITH THE

00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:49.948
BEHIND THIS. AND IT'S- THEY

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:52.584
HAVE NO WAY. OF SAYING THAT

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:54.486
THAT IS FALSE BECAUSE NO ONE

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:55.554
BELIEVES THEM ANYWAY BECAUSE

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.923
THEY'RE IN PRISON. AND I WANT

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.124
US TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:01.493
GOVERNMENT WORK BETTER. WITHOUT

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.495
CREATING SCAPEGOATS OUT OF

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:05.798
FOLKS WHO ARE ALREADY YOU KNOW

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:08.567
IN PRISON- AND I WOULD LIKE FOR

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:09.735
US TO FIND SOME ADDITIONAL

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.438
SAFEGUARDS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

00:16:12.504 --> 00:16:15.474
WITHOUT REALLY SORT OF-

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:19.278
CONTINUING TO. SHARE PRIVATE

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:22.681
INFORMATION- BECAUSE WE CAN'T

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:24.083
FIX AN ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:26.285
FIXING WITH ANY D. D. AND SO

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:27.853
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.756
CAN MAKE IT A LITTLE CLOSER- TO

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.424
THE GROVE BILL THAT WE ACTUALLY

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:33.826
SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:36.195
DISCUSSING IN THIS COMMITTEE-

00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.730
BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO ME THAT

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:39.765
THAT BILL MADE. STRUCK THE

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.367
RIGHT BALANCE IN TERMS OF

00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:42.901
REQUESTING INFORMATION AND

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:44.336
HAVING THE CHECKS AND BALANCES

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:45.170
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:46.271
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE MAY BE

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:48.474
DISCUSSED BEFORE THIS GETS TO

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.310
THE FLOOR- THAT. I'D LIKE TO

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:53.412
SEE THAT HAPPEN. THANK YOU FOR

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:54.780
THOSE COMMENTS SENATOR LET ME

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.415
JUST RESPOND TO IT BECAUSE A

00:16:56.482 --> 00:16:57.649
COUPLE OF THE POINTS YOU'RE A

00:16:57.716 --> 00:16:59.485
STATE I THINK ONE OF THE MOST.

00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:01.086
IMPORTANT POINT YOU RAISE IS

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:04.356
THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:06.792
IN MANY OF THESE CASES. THE

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:09.094
INMATES NAMES WERE BEING USED

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:10.462
TO FILE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:12.231
CLAIMS NOT BITE AND MAKE

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:13.899
THEMSELVES BUT BY ORGANIZED

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:15.868
FRAUD RINGS THAT WERE. OUTSIDE

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:18.871
TO. THE INMATES WERE THEMSELVES

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:20.706
VICTIMS AS YOU SAID IT IDENTITY

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:24.710
THEFT AND SO THAT. IS ALSO.

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:27.780
WHAT THIS BILL WILL PREVENT. IS

00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:29.948
ENSURING THAT. WHETHER IT'S

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:31.183
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.017
INCARCERATED OR SIMPLY

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:33.786
INDIVIDUALS WHOSE NAMES ARE

00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:35.387
BEING UTILIZED THAT WE'RE NOT

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:37.956
PAYING OUT FRAUDULENT CLAIMS IN

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:39.958
THE NAMES OF INCARCERATED TO

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:42.661
CALIFORNIANS- AND THEN THEY THE

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.430
SECOND POINT THAT YOU MENTIONED

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:47.533

MANAGEMENT AND OTHER ISSUES I

00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:52.471
THINK THAT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT-

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:54.840
AN IMPORTANT POINT AND MY TEAM

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:55.607

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.659
PENALTIES WHICH CAN BE ACTUALLY

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.427
LESS THAN PAYING THE WORKER

WHAT THEY'RE OUT. WITH THE

00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:45.263

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:58.455
MILITARY TANK ANY MILITARY- ANY

00:45:58.522 --> 00:46:00.324
FIREARM ANY OTHER SORTS OF

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.459
EQUIPMENT THEY CAN DO THAT- AS

00:46:02.526 --> 00:46:03.227
LONG AS THEY HAVE A

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:04.428
CONVERSATION WITH THE GOVERNING

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:06.230

OFFICIALS. BUT WE ALSO HAVE A

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:16.440
PROCESS BY WHICH THE PUBLIC

EXPENDITURES THAT THAT MAKES

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:25.716
SENSE AND WHAT THIS BILL SAYS

00:46:25.782 --> 00:46:27.484
IS THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:29.586

00:46:29.653 --> 00:46:30.621
CONVERSATION WITH A LOCAL

00:46:30.687 --> 00:46:32.022
GOVERNING BOARD TO SAY THIS IS

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:33.957
THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT. THAT WE

00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:35.092

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:47.741
HAS BEEN A LOT OF

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:49.510

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:03.057
THAT- THIS BILL CREATES A

01:36:03.124 --> 01:36:03.691
VOLUNTARY WAY FOR INDIVIDUALS.

01:36:03.757 --> 01:36:05.092

THIS IS A 100% INVOLUNTARY. IT

01:36:19.874 --> 01:36:20.541
WOULD BE BASED ON

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.676
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM HEALTH

01:36:22.743 --> 01:36:24.578

RECOMMENDATION THAT THIS COULD

01:36:31.986 --> 01:36:33.521
BENEFIT AN INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN

01:36:33.587 --> 01:36:35.022
SENTENCED. AND AGAIN IT'S

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:37.358
VOLUNTARY. INDIVIDUAL GOES DOWN

02:00:50.176 --> 02:00:51.544
IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL TO

02:00:51.611 --> 02:00:53.946
PEOPLE. AND NOT HARMFUL ONE

02:00:54.013 --> 02:00:55.081
THING I ALSO NEGLECTED TO

02:00:55.147 --> 02:00:57.416
MENTION WHEN I FIRST YOU KNOW

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:58.784
POSITIVE FORM SOME OF THE

02:00:58.851 --> 02:01:00.119
CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

02:01:00.186 --> 02:01:01.520
BILL I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT

02:01:01.587 --> 02:01:02.588
THE ASSEMBLY FLORIDA AND FOUND

02:01:02.655 --> 02:01:05.057
THAT- BUT PRETTY MUCH ALMOST

02:01:05.124 --> 02:01:07.259
EVERY SINGLE. DEMOCRAT IN THE

02:01:07.326 --> 02:01:09.295
ASSEMBLY INCLUDING SOME VERY

02:01:09.362 --> 02:01:11.864
VERY PROGRESSIVE LEADERS ON

02:01:11.931 --> 02:01:13.633
THESE ISSUES VOTED FOR THE BILL

02:01:13.699 --> 02:01:15.034
AND THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE SEVERAL

02:01:15.101 --> 02:01:17.937
TAKE A HARDER LOOK- AT THE

02:01:18.004 --> 02:01:20.239
BILL. SO I GUESS IT'S JUST A

02:01:20.306 --> 02:01:22.808
FEW QUICK QUESTIONS- FOR THE-

02:01:22.875 --> 02:01:26.379
FOR THE AUTHOR. THERE WAS A

02:01:26.445 --> 02:01:28.247
COMMENT- EARLIER ABOUT HEALTH I

02:01:28.314 --> 02:01:28.981
THINK FROM THE PUBLIC

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:30.816
DEFENDER'S ASSOCIATION. THAT

02:01:30.883 --> 02:01:32.318
THIS COULD LEAD TO SOMEONE

02:01:32.385 --> 02:01:35.254
HAVING A LONGER. PERIOD OF TIME

02:01:35.321 --> 02:01:36.989
IN A LOCKED FACILITY. THAN THEY

02:01:37.056 --> 02:01:38.824
WOULD HAVE JUST BY THE PRISON

02:01:38.891 --> 02:01:40.960
SENTENCE. I MIGHT I MIGHT BE

02:01:41.027 --> 02:01:43.229
MISREADING THE BILL PUT UP MY

02:01:43.295 --> 02:01:44.864
UNDERSTANDING WAS DIED THE BILL

02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:46.065
SPECIFICALLY SAYS AND PLEASE

02:01:46.132 --> 02:01:47.767
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IF IT

02:01:47.833 --> 02:01:48.401
DOESN'T I THINK THIS NEEDS TO

02:01:48.467 --> 02:01:50.603
BE CHANGED. THAT THE

02:01:50.670 --> 02:01:53.506
COMBINATION OF THE- OF THE LOCK

02:01:53.572 --> 02:01:55.307
TREATMENT PLUS TO STEP DOWN.

02:01:55.374 --> 02:01:59.211
CAN NOT EXCEED. V. WHAT THE

02:01:59.278 --> 02:02:00.946
PRISON SENTENCE WOULD HAVE

02:02:01.013 --> 02:02:04.717
BEEN- AND I IN ADDITION. IF A

02:02:04.784 --> 02:02:05.885
PERSON DECIDES TO LEAVE

02:02:05.951 --> 02:02:07.620
TREATMENT AND GO BACK GO AND GO

02:02:07.687 --> 02:02:11.824
INTO A PRISON SETTING. THE

02:02:11.891 --> 02:02:12.458
TOTAL AMOUNT CAN'T EXCEED. THAT

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:14.794
SENT OKAY YOU CLARIFY THAT TIME

02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:15.594
FOR ME BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE

02:02:15.661 --> 02:02:17.196
SURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T. IF YOU

02:02:17.263 --> 02:02:19.565
CHOOSE THIS OPTION IF THEY

02:02:19.632 --> 02:02:20.132
DON'T END UP SPENDING MORE

02:02:20.199 --> 02:02:22.134
TIME. THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD

02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:26.839
THEY SIMPLY- ACCEPTED THE-JAILER PRISON SONS. THANK YOU-

02:02:26.906 --> 02:02:29.008
AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE BACK

02:02:29.075 --> 02:02:30.509
AND FORTH HERE AND I'D LIKE TO

02:02:30.576 --> 02:02:32.211
GO INTO GREAT DETAIL ON THIS

02:02:32.278 --> 02:02:33.746
YOU KNOW AS THAT THE CHAIR

02:02:33.813 --> 02:02:36.315
ALLOWS US TO- BUT YEAH THAT WAS

02:02:36.382 --> 02:02:37.283
THE INTENT OF THE BILL WHEN WE

02:02:37.349 --> 02:02:38.951
HIT WE INTRODUCED IT AND WE

02:02:39.018 --> 02:02:40.786
TOOK AN AMENDMENT. IN THE

02:02:40.853 --> 02:02:42.054
ASSEMBLY THAT CLARIFIES THAT

02:02:42.121 --> 02:02:44.023
SO. I'M KIND OF AT A LOSS AND

02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:46.025
SO IF WE CAN FURTHER CLARIFY

02:02:46.092 --> 02:02:47.993
THAT POINT. I'M WILLING TO DO

02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:49.962
SO BUT I THINK WE'RE CLEAR.

02:02:50.029 --> 02:02:52.665
THAT THE INDIVIDUALS- THAT TIME

02:02:52.732 --> 02:02:54.433
IN IN THIS IN THE TREATMENT

02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:57.169
WOULD WOULD NOT. EXCEED WHAT

02:02:57.236 --> 02:02:57.737
THEY WOULD GET THROUGH THEIR

02:02:57.803 --> 02:02:59.472
UNDERLYING SENTENCE. INDOOR

02:02:59.538 --> 02:03:01.006
PROBATION OKAY WOULD YOU BE

02:03:01.073 --> 02:03:02.942
WILLING TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO

02:03:03.008 --> 02:03:04.643
DIE. IF THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:06.812
CHANGED TO THE BILL. TO PUT

02:03:06.879 --> 02:03:11.150
GUARDRAILS- IN PLACE. THAT THAT

02:03:11.217 --> 02:03:13.052
YOU'LL DO THAT ABSOLUTELY AND I

02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:17.123
ALSO IN TERMS OF- I. ZERO

02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:19.058
SOMETIMES P. GET RELEASED

02:03:19.125 --> 02:03:22.495
BECAUSE OF- CREDITS FOR. GOOD

02:03:22.561 --> 02:03:24.130
BEHAVIOR OTHER KINDS OF CREDITS

02:03:24.196 --> 02:03:25.397
THAT THEY RECEIVED TO THEIR

02:03:25.464 --> 02:03:27.133
THEIR SENTENCES LET'S SAY TEN

02:03:27.199 --> 02:03:28.467
YEARS BUT BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT

02:03:28.534 --> 02:03:30.336
KINDS OF CREDITS ARE ABLE TO BE

02:03:30.402 --> 02:03:34.473
RELEASED IN SEVEN YEARS- AND I.

02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:36.442
WOULD ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:03:36.509 --> 02:03:37.576
AND AGAIN IT'S A LITTLE

02:03:37.643 --> 02:03:39.011
THEORETICAL BECAUSE IF YOU'RE

02:03:39.078 --> 02:03:42.615
NOT INCARCERATED- BY YOU KNOW

02:03:42.681 --> 02:03:43.682
YOU OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE ACCESS

02:03:43.749 --> 02:03:46.185
TO THOSE TO THOSE CREDITS I AM

02:03:46.252 --> 02:03:47.920
I WOULD ASK THAT YOU EXPLORE

02:03:47.987 --> 02:03:51.924
HELD MAYBE. DOT CONCEPTS- COULD

02:03:51.991 --> 02:03:53.659
BE INCORPORATED BECAUSE RIGHT

02:03:53.726 --> 02:03:54.660
NOW I THINK IT'S DRAFTED AS

02:03:54.727 --> 02:03:56.529
WHAT THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE CAN

02:03:56.595 --> 02:03:58.464
BE AND WE KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE

02:03:58.531 --> 02:04:00.332
DON'T SERVE THE MAXIMUM

02:04:00.399 --> 02:04:02.368
SENTENCE- THEY SERVE SOMETHING

02:04:02.434 --> 02:04:05.471
LESS THAN THAT- OF BECAUSE

02:04:05.538 --> 02:04:07.573
THEY'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:10.109
CREDITS OR WHATEVER ELSE- AND I

02:04:10.176 --> 02:04:11.677
WOULD LIKE LIKE TO SEE THE BILL

02:04:11.744 --> 02:04:13.813
INCORPORATE. THAT POSSIBILITY

02:04:13.879 --> 02:04:15.147
SO THEY'RE NOT SO THE DOG

02:04:15.214 --> 02:04:17.316
TOPPED THE YOU'RE GONNA PUT IF

02:04:17.383 --> 02:04:19.318
NEEDED GUARD ROSEN FOR HIS

02:04:19.385 --> 02:04:21.520
AUTOMATICALLY INTO THE HIGH

02:04:21.587 --> 02:04:23.289
RANGE OF THE SENTENCE I KNOW

02:04:23.355 --> 02:04:26.492
IT'S COMPLICATED- ADAM I KNOW

02:04:26.559 --> 02:04:27.126
WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU

02:04:27.193 --> 02:04:32.631
ON THAT- BUT I'D I'D LIKE TO

02:04:32.698 --> 02:04:34.466
SEE THAT. BOMBING CORPORATE ED-

02:04:34.533 --> 02:04:35.835
INTO YOU OPEN THE LOCK COVERS.

02:04:35.901 --> 02:04:37.970
YEAH JUST ON THAT IT AND I DO

02:04:38.037 --> 02:04:39.805
THE I'M NOT SURE FOR D. A.

02:04:39.872 --> 02:04:41.073
STILL ON THE LINE WE HAVE OUR

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:43.142
DEPUTY YOLO COUNTY CHIEF DEPUTY

02:04:43.209 --> 02:04:44.343
JONATHAN RAVEN HERE COULD

02:04:44.410 --> 02:04:45.811
CLARIFY MY UNDERSTANDING IS

02:04:45.878 --> 02:04:47.413
IT'S A KIND OF A SWEET SPOT OF

02:04:47.479 --> 02:04:47.980
WHO WOULD. WHO WOULD

02:04:48.047 --> 02:04:49.615
PARTICIPATE IN THIS IS A NOT

02:04:49.682 --> 02:04:51.483
MISDEMEANORS. THESE ARE NOT

02:04:51.550 --> 02:04:53.385
SERIOUS CRIMES AND FELONIES SO

02:04:53.452 --> 02:04:54.119
THESE AREN'T YOUR LONGER

02:04:54.186 --> 02:04:55.955
SENTENCES. SO THE SHORTER

02:04:56.021 --> 02:04:59.191
SENTENCES ANYWAY JUST BY THE

02:04:59.258 --> 02:05:00.292
FACT OF THE TIME THEY ARE. THE

02:05:00.359 --> 02:05:01.660
DURATION OF THE OF THE

02:05:01.727 --> 02:05:03.863
TREATMENT. IT WOULDN'T BE THE

02:05:03.929 --> 02:05:05.264
E. WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:05:05.331 --> 02:05:06.866
GET CREDITS AND HAVE A LOWER

02:05:06.932 --> 02:05:08.267
SPENT TIME IS THAT CORRECT.

02:05:08.334 --> 02:05:10.402
MYSTERY THAT IS CORRECT AND- I

02:05:10.469 --> 02:05:11.971
THINK YEAH BOTH THE OR RIGHT

02:05:12.037 --> 02:05:14.106
ON- BY OPERATIONAL LOG THE THIS

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:16.041
POPULATION WOULD BE CONSIDERED

02:05:16.108 --> 02:05:17.376
IN CUSTODY EVEN THOUGH THEY

02:05:17.443 --> 02:05:19.912
MIGHT BE IN. A RESIDENCE- BUT

02:05:19.979 --> 02:05:21.881
THEY CAN'T LEAVE OF COURSE- AND

02:05:21.947 --> 02:05:23.115
SO BY OPERATION F LAW THEY

02:05:23.182 --> 02:05:24.083
WOULD STILL GET ALL THEIR

02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:25.851
CREDITS AND I BELIEVE FOR THE

02:05:25.918 --> 02:05:26.986
AUTHOR THAT IS CERTAINLY THE

02:05:27.052 --> 02:05:29.221
INTENT. THAT THEY DO KNOW MORE

02:05:29.288 --> 02:05:29.955
TIME THAN THEY WOULD DO IF THEY

02:05:30.022 --> 02:05:32.224
WERE IN CUSTODY- AND CREDITS

02:05:32.291 --> 02:05:33.826
WOULD COUNT IN THAT REGARD AND

02:05:33.893 --> 02:05:34.827
HOW HELLO THE CREDITS BE

02:05:34.894 --> 02:05:36.161
DETERMINED IF YOU'RE A NEW

WOULD SPEND IN THE TREATMENT

02:05:49.942 --> 02:05:51.143
SETTING I THINK IF YOU'RE IN

02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:53.279
THE SECURE TREATMENT SETTING NO

02:05:53.345 --> 02:05:54.380
MATTER WHAT. YOU WOULD GET THE

YOU GET AUTOMATIC CREDITS SO

02:06:01.854 --> 02:06:03.188
SIMILAR THAT IF YOU WERE IN THE

02:06:06.859 --> 02:06:08.961
CREDITS. IRWIN I DEFECT

02:06:09.028 --> 02:06:12.498
CLARIFIED- THE OTHER COUNTIES

02:06:12.564 --> 02:06:13.766
IN TERMS OF THE SENTENCE

02:06:13.832 --> 02:06:15.601
BECAUSE SOMETIMES. YOU MAY

02:06:15.668 --> 02:06:18.103
MAYBE YOUR IT'S A FELONY FOR

02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:20.139
AUTO BURGLARY BUSES PICK ONE OF

02:06:20.205 --> 02:06:22.141
THE FELONY AUTO BURGLARY. FACT

02:06:22.207 --> 02:06:24.443
THAT COULD QUALIFY- SOMEONE

02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:26.145
MIGHT HAVE PRIORS TO THE END UP

02:06:26.211 --> 02:06:28.647
HAVING. ENHANCEMENTS OR OTHER

02:06:28.714 --> 02:06:31.750
THINGS SO- IN TERMS OF FAN AND

02:06:31.817 --> 02:06:32.952
I I'VE I SHOULD'VE GONE BACK

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:38.490
AND LOOKED. AT THIS BEFORE- BUT

02:06:38.557 --> 02:06:39.725
IN TERMS. WHEN WE SAY OKAY HAVE

02:06:39.792 --> 02:06:41.593
TO SPEND AMOUNT OF TIME ENTRY.

02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:43.495
BOB IS AT THE BASE SENTENCE OR

02:06:43.562 --> 02:06:45.864
IS IT- BASINS PLUS ANY

02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:48.834
ENHANCEMENTS. TO INCLUDE

02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:52.338
ENHANCEMENTS HI- I WOULD MY

02:06:52.404 --> 02:06:54.206
TAKE ON A IS THAT THEY SHOULD

02:06:54.273 --> 02:06:56.942
BE LIMITED TO THE BAY SENTENCE

02:06:57.009 --> 02:06:57.376
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

02:06:57.443 --> 02:06:59.144
ENHANCEMENTS ARE. AND WE SHOULD

02:06:59.211 --> 02:07:00.079
BE GETTING RID OF A LOT OF OUR

02:07:00.145 --> 02:07:01.447
ANNOUNCEMENTS I THINK AND YOU

02:07:01.513 --> 02:07:03.716
MAY DISAGREE WITH ME ON THIS I

02:07:03.782 --> 02:07:04.817
THINK ENHANCEMENTS IN

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:06.719
CALIFORNIA ARE ATROCIOUS AND

02:07:06.785 --> 02:07:08.821
DATE AND UP TURNING. WHAT WOULD

02:07:08.887 --> 02:07:11.623
BE A REASONABLE SENTENCE FOR-

02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:13.192
YOU KNOW FOR NONVIOLENT FELONY

02:07:13.258 --> 02:07:15.160
INTO SOMETHING MUCH MUCH

02:07:15.227 --> 02:07:19.331
GREATER- AND SO I WOULD REQUEST

02:07:19.398 --> 02:07:21.533
THAT THIS BE LIMITED TO. THE

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:23.369
BASE CENTER AND SEN AND WHEN

02:07:23.435 --> 02:07:24.703
YOU TALK ABOUT MAYBE LIKE WHAT

02:07:24.770 --> 02:07:26.605
WOULD BE LIKE SAY A TWO YEAR

02:07:26.672 --> 02:07:28.607
SENTENCE IT TURNS INTO A SEVEN

02:07:28.674 --> 02:07:31.844
OR EIGHT YEAR SENTENCE- YOU

02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:33.145
KNOW THE IDEA OF SAYING YOU

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:34.880
HAVE TO SOMEONE HAVE TO AGREE

02:07:34.947 --> 02:07:36.482
TO A YEAR'S WORTH OF. DRUG

02:07:36.548 --> 02:07:39.752
TREATMENT- IS ARRIVING COULD

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:44.189
GET ON REASONABLE AND SO I'D

02:07:44.256 --> 02:07:44.790
LIKE TO SEE A GUARD RAIL AND-

02:07:44.857 --> 02:07:47.359
THAT. IT'S OF A SHORTER YOU

OPERATING IN GOOD FAITH THAT I

02:08:00.105 --> 02:08:02.174

02:08:02.241 --> 02:08:03.175

02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:10.883

WANT TO PUT OUT THERE THAT I

02:08:11.550 --> 02:08:13.218
THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT. FOR

ME TO SEE GUARDRAILS AROUND

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:16.722

AUTO BURGLARY FELONY THAT WAS

02:08:23.228 --> 02:08:25.297
DRUG RELATED MAYBE THE PERSON

02:08:25.364 --> 02:08:27.232
DOES HAVE A HISTORY- BUT IT

02:08:27.299 --> 02:08:28.801
TURNS OUT TO YOUR SENSE INTO

02:08:28.867 --> 02:08:30.969
SOME MUCH LONGER SENTENCE. THAT

02:08:31.036 --> 02:08:31.637
MIGHT BE AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF

02:08:31.703 --> 02:08:34.139
TIME. FOR DRUG TREATMENT SO IS

02:08:34.206 --> 02:08:38.277
THAT SOMETHING THEY ARE. OPEN

02:08:38.343 --> 02:08:40.846
TO. WORKING ON OKAY- THE- HI

02:08:40.913 --> 02:08:41.847

COME IN THIS IS YOU KNOW IT'S

02:08:45.317 --> 02:08:48.187
IMPORTANT- DISCUSSION- MY

02:08:48.253 --> 02:08:49.755
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

02:08:49.822 --> 02:08:52.825
JUDGE. AND THE JUDGE AB ONE OF

02:08:52.891 --> 02:08:54.560
THE CONCERNS THE OPPOSITION HAS

02:08:54.626 --> 02:08:58.397
EXPRESSED WHICH I UNDER I AGREE

02:08:58.464 --> 02:08:59.665
WITH THEM AND I THINK THE BILL.

02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:01.066
ADDRESSES OUT BUT MAYBE IT CAN

02:09:01.133 --> 02:09:04.369
BE CLEAR. IS THAT JUDGES SHOULD

02:09:04.436 --> 02:09:05.370
BE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO

02:09:05.437 --> 02:09:07.372
ARE. SERVE FORMULATING WHAT THE

02:09:07.439 --> 02:09:09.274
APPROPRIATE TREATMENT AS NOT A

02:09:09.341 --> 02:09:11.176
JUDGE WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE AN

02:09:11.243 --> 02:09:13.779
EXPERT IN THE AREA. I THINK THE

02:09:13.846 --> 02:09:15.747
BILL HAS LANGUAGE THAT THE

02:09:15.814 --> 02:09:17.816
JUDGE'S DETERMINATION IS

02:09:17.883 --> 02:09:19.885
BOUNDED BY THE RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:09:19.952 --> 02:09:21.954
OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CAN YOU

02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:24.223
JUST COMMENT ON- EITHER THE

02:09:24.289 --> 02:09:25.924
AUTHOR OR THE WITNESS ABOUT

02:09:25.991 --> 02:09:28.894
WHAT HEALTH. STRESS HOW HOW

02:09:28.961 --> 02:09:30.496
RIGID THAT BOUNDING IS BECAUSE

02:09:30.562 --> 02:09:31.396
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR

02:09:31.463 --> 02:09:33.198
JUDGE. NOT TO BE ABLE TO GO

02:09:33.265 --> 02:09:34.600
BEYOND WHAT THE HEALTH

02:09:34.666 --> 02:09:38.470
PROFESSIONALS ARE RECOMMENDING.

02:09:38.537 --> 02:09:39.738
BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT THE THAT

02:09:39.805 --> 02:09:43.242
THE JUDGE WILL BE A PLEA. FOR

02:09:43.308 --> 02:09:44.710
GOES TO COURT THERE WILL BE A

02:09:44.776 --> 02:09:47.412
JUDGMENT. AND SO AFTER THAT

02:09:47.479 --> 02:09:50.682
THEN THE DA. WORKING WITH THAT

02:09:50.749 --> 02:09:52.851
THAT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS COULD

02:09:52.918 --> 02:09:54.086
COME BACK AND SAY BEFORE THIS

02:09:54.153 --> 02:09:55.187

BEACH SERVING HALF THAT TIME

02:11:31.717 --> 02:11:34.286
RIGHT BUT- WE DON'T ENVISION

02:11:34.353 --> 02:11:36.121

KNOW IT WOULD PROBABLY BE- MUCH

02:11:44.062 --> 02:11:48.133
LESS TIME. THAT THEY WOULD- GET

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:50.202
BETTER AND THEN BASED ON

ASSESSMENT BY THE HEALTH CARE

02:11:51.903 --> 02:11:54.106
PROFESSIONALS- ONCE THEY DECIDE

THAT THEY NO LONGER NEED TO BE

02:11:56.275 --> 02:11:58.277
THERE THEN THEN THEY SHOULDN'T

02:11:58.343 --> 02:11:59.378
BE THERE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE

02:11:59.444 --> 02:12:00.746
ALSO SHOULDN'T BE IN A

02:12:00.812 --> 02:12:02.347
RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY

02:12:02.414 --> 02:12:03.382
THEY DON'T NEED INPATIENT AND

02:12:03.448 --> 02:12:04.850
THAT THAT WOULDN'T BE FOR THEM

02:12:04.916 --> 02:12:05.550
EITHER YOU DON'T WANT A HIGHER

02:12:05.617 --> 02:12:06.818
LEVEL OF CLEAR YOU WANT THE

02:12:06.885 --> 02:12:08.954
LOWEST LEVEL OF CARE. AND IN

02:12:09.021 --> 02:12:11.590
THIS CASE OF SOMEONE- HIT OUT

02:12:11.657 --> 02:12:13.025
OF THE PARK AS YOU SAY AND GOT

02:12:13.091 --> 02:12:14.826
WELL THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:12:14.893 --> 02:12:16.828
FINISH THEIR SENTENCE AND BE

02:12:16.895 --> 02:12:18.063
DONE AND HAVE THEIR CASE- THEIR

02:12:18.130 --> 02:12:21.867
CONVICTION EXPUNGED WHEN YOU

02:12:21.933 --> 02:12:22.501

02:12:22.567 --> 02:12:23.702
MEAN. AB OUT OF CUSTODY OUT OF

02:12:23.769 --> 02:12:25.103
ANY TYPE OF CUSTOMER. SO IF

02:12:25.170 --> 02:12:27.906
THEY'RE SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS

02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:29.641
FOR THE SENTENCES FIVE YEARS

02:12:29.708 --> 02:12:31.510

THREE MORE MONTHS IN A STEP

02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:43.221
DOWN FACILITY. SO THAT WOULD BE

02:12:43.288 --> 02:12:46.925
A YEAR. THAN THEY WOULD BE OUT-OF CUSTODY IN ONE YEAR AND SET

02:12:46.992 --> 02:12:48.860
UP A FIVE YEAR SENTENCE

02:12:48.927 --> 02:12:53.799
CORRECT. OKAY. OKAY AND I THINK

02:13:07.946 --> 02:13:10.482
DECISION. IT WOULD PROBABLY BE-

02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:11.550
TREATMENT PROVIDERS AND ARE

02:13:11.616 --> 02:13:12.617

X. IS EXPUNGED. AUTOMATICALLY I

CUCKOO'S NEST WHICH- IS NOT. A

02:14:56.822 --> 02:14:59.257
GREAT MOVIE BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY

02:14:59.324 --> 02:15:00.559
TALKS ABOUT HOW YOU WIND UP IN

02:15:00.625 --> 02:15:02.627
A FACILITY- AND YOU'RE NOT ABLE

02:15:02.694 --> 02:15:04.729
TO GET OUT- IN ALL OF THE

02:15:04.796 --> 02:15:06.631
THINGS THAT HAPPEN. BUT AT THE

02:15:06.698 --> 02:15:09.835
SAME TIME LISTENING TO THE

02:15:09.901 --> 02:15:12.237
OPPOSITION. I HAVE TO BE REALLY

02:15:12.304 --> 02:15:17.342
HONEST. AND I THINK IT'S

02:15:17.409 --> 02:15:18.743
IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO HEAR

02:15:18.810 --> 02:15:20.679
THIS YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS

02:15:20.745 --> 02:15:21.913
THAT A THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:23.381
PEOPLE OUT IN THE WORLD WHO ARE

02:15:23.448 --> 02:15:26.585
ADDICTS. N. B. THERE ARE A LOT

02:15:26.651 --> 02:15:28.220
OF PEOPLE OUT IN THE WORLD WHO

02:15:28.286 --> 02:15:30.922
DO COMMIT CRIMES AND NOT EVERY

02:15:30.989 --> 02:15:33.658
CRIME THAT IS COMMITTED. COMES

02:15:33.725 --> 02:15:36.127
FROM A PLACE OF TRAUMA- AND I'M

02:15:36.194 --> 02:15:37.496
JUST SAYING AS ABLACK WOMAN I

02:15:37.562 --> 02:15:39.631
THINK WE HAVE TO COULD NOT USE

02:15:39.698 --> 02:15:42.234
THAT- AND LEAN ON THAT EVERY

02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:44.269
SINGLE TIME SOME PEOPLE DO MAKE

02:15:44.336 --> 02:15:47.539
REALLY BAD DECISIONS. AND NEED.

02:15:47.606 --> 02:15:52.410
HELP AND SOMETIMES THEY NEED

02:15:52.477 --> 02:15:55.347
HELP THAT THEY DON'T WANT- TO

02:15:55.413 --> 02:15:57.415
HELP THEM GET BETTER OR TO GET

02:15:57.482 --> 02:15:57.983
IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY ARE

02:15:58.049 --> 02:16:00.452
ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENT SET OF

02:16:00.519 --> 02:16:03.989
DECISIONS AND PUT THEMSELVES-

02:16:04.055 --> 02:16:05.790
IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF

02:16:05.857 --> 02:16:08.493
CIRCUMSTANCES TO ALLOW THEM TO

02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:13.031
MAKE BETTER DECISIONS- I ALSO

02:16:13.098 --> 02:16:14.199
HAVE TO SAY I THINK ONE OF THE

02:16:14.266 --> 02:16:16.101
MAJOR REASONS THAT THIS BILL

02:16:16.167 --> 02:16:18.069
HAS A LOT OF OPPOSITION IS

02:16:18.136 --> 02:16:20.071
BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY LACK

02:16:20.138 --> 02:16:21.606
OF TRUST WITH THE SOURCE WITH

02:16:21.673 --> 02:16:24.242
THE SPONSOR- AND FOLKS ARE NOT

02:16:24.309 --> 02:16:26.044
REALLY INTERESTED IN YOU KNOW

02:16:26.111 --> 02:16:28.313
WORKING WITH D. A.'S OFFICES

02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:30.916
BECAUSE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT-

02:16:30.982 --> 02:16:32.817
YOU KNOW TO BE QUITE FRANK.

02:16:32.884 --> 02:16:34.519
THOSE OFFICES ARE THE ONES THAT

02:16:34.586 --> 02:16:37.889
ARE OPPOSING A LOT OF THE BILLS

02:16:37.956 --> 02:16:39.624
THAT ARE FOCUSED ON CRIMINAL

02:16:39.691 --> 02:16:44.563
LEGAL REFORM- END. IF WE ARE

02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:47.399
GOING TO OPPOSE SOMETHING WHAT

02:16:47.465 --> 02:16:49.868
IS THE ALTERNATIVE YOU KNOW

02:16:49.935 --> 02:16:53.538
AND- HOW VIABLE IS IT TOO

02:16:53.605 --> 02:16:58.109
REALLY ADDRESSING THE ISSUE- SO

02:16:58.176 --> 02:17:00.579
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE

02:17:00.645 --> 02:17:03.181
THIS IS IT'S- IT'S NOT

02:17:03.248 --> 02:17:04.983
COMPLICATED BUT IT'S HARD

02:17:05.050 --> 02:17:06.151
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD FOR

02:17:06.217 --> 02:17:07.619
FOLKS TO SAY PEOPLE MAKE BAD

02:17:07.686 --> 02:17:09.054
DECISIONS PEOPLE DO BAD THINGS

02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:10.255
THAT PEOPLE NEED HELP AND

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:11.289
SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T WANT THE

02:17:11.356 --> 02:17:13.658
HELP. THAT THEY HAVE TO GUESTS

02:17:13.725 --> 02:17:16.027
FOR THAT THEY NEED- AND I'M

02:17:16.094 --> 02:17:17.462
SPEAKING AS SOMEONE WHO HAS

02:17:17.529 --> 02:17:19.230
ADDICTION IN MY FAMILY ANYWAYS

02:17:19.297 --> 02:17:20.765
HAVE FOLKS WERE INCARCERATED

02:17:20.832 --> 02:17:23.435
BECAUSE OF ADDICTION- SO DON'T

02:17:23.501 --> 02:17:25.604
NOBODY TELL ME THAT I DON'T

02:17:25.670 --> 02:17:27.172
KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. SO

02:17:27.238 --> 02:17:28.707
I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND I

02:17:28.773 --> 02:17:29.908
SPOKE WITH THE AUTHOR AND HE

02:17:29.975 --> 02:17:30.809
SAID THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE

02:17:30.875 --> 02:17:32.277
HERE AND SO MISTER CHAIR IF YOU

02:17:32.344 --> 02:17:33.979
DON'T MIND I WILL BE ADDRESSING

02:17:34.045 --> 02:17:36.481
SOME OF MY QUESTIONS ALSO TO-

02:17:36.548 --> 02:17:39.818
THE USER. SO A I WANTED TO KNOW

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:42.187
HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE FUNDED

02:17:42.253 --> 02:17:43.455
BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS

02:17:43.521 --> 02:17:45.590
THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY SO IT'S

02:17:45.657 --> 02:17:46.825
NOT ABOUT CONSTRUCTING A NEW

02:17:46.891 --> 02:17:48.526
FACILITY BUT THERE IS CURRENTLY

02:17:48.593 --> 02:17:50.261
A JUVENILE FACILITY THAT IS NOT

02:17:50.328 --> 02:17:52.263
BEING USED AND SO THE GOAL IS

02:17:52.330 --> 02:17:53.665
TO FIGURE OUT MAYBE NOT THE

02:17:53.732 --> 02:17:56.201
GOAL BUT HOW ELSE COULD YOU USE

02:17:56.268 --> 02:17:58.737
THIS PARTICULAR FACILITY SO

02:17:58.803 --> 02:17:59.671
EIGHT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT NEW

02:17:59.738 --> 02:18:00.972
CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE THAT WAS

02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:02.741
SOMETHING THAT WAS REFERENCED

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:05.310
BY. THE OPPOSITION. IT'S NOT

02:18:05.377 --> 02:18:07.612
NEW CONSTRUCTION CENTER AND-

02:18:07.679 --> 02:18:09.581
THAT JUVENILE FACILITY HAS BEEN

02:18:09.648 --> 02:18:11.216
TAKEN OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE IT

02:18:11.282 --> 02:18:12.717
WAS CONTROVERSIAL WE THOUGHT IT

02:18:12.784 --> 02:18:14.085
WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO HAVE A

02:18:14.152 --> 02:18:16.855
SOFTER SETTING. WITH THE

02:18:16.921 --> 02:18:17.989
OPPOSITION UNCOMFORTABLE WITH

02:18:18.056 --> 02:18:19.624
THAT- WE TOOK THAT OFF THE

02:18:19.691 --> 02:18:22.494
TABLE SO WHAT WE ENVISION IS.

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:24.929
AS I SAID. HOUSE SO LIKE WE

02:18:24.996 --> 02:18:25.997
HAVE A PLACE CALLED WALTER'S

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:27.766
HOUSE WALTER'S HOUSE HAS ABOUT

02:18:27.832 --> 02:18:29.534
THIRTY BEDS IN IT- AS A MATTER

02:18:29.601 --> 02:18:31.002
OF FACT THAT DIRECTOR OF ALTERS

02:18:31.069 --> 02:18:32.771
HOW SPOKE IN SUPPORT. IN THE

02:18:32.837 --> 02:18:34.839
ASSEMBLY OF THIS BILL AND

02:18:34.906 --> 02:18:36.274
WALTER'S HOUSE MAYBE MOVING

02:18:36.341 --> 02:18:37.742
ACROSS TOWN CLOSER ON HEALTH

02:18:37.809 --> 02:18:39.778
AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THAT

02:18:39.844 --> 02:18:42.547
BUILDING MAY BE OPEN- AND

02:18:42.614 --> 02:18:44.449
THAT'S THE TYPE OF THE-

02:18:44.516 --> 02:18:47.552
BUILDING. OR FACILITY THAT I A

02:18:47.619 --> 02:18:48.653
OR THAT WE ENVISION WE WOULD BE

02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:50.922
USING- IT WOULD BE SECURE IT

02:18:50.989 --> 02:18:52.357
WOULD BE LOCKED. BUT IT WOULD

02:18:52.424 --> 02:18:54.926
BE A SOFT FACILITY LIKE A LARGE

02:18:54.993 --> 02:18:57.262
HOUSE. OR APARTMENT BUILDING OR

02:18:57.328 --> 02:18:59.864
SOMETHING LIKE THAT- DO AS AS-

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:02.167
MISTER ISAAC SAID. NO BARS NO

02:19:02.233 --> 02:19:03.802
GUNS NO GUARDS IT'S NOTHING

02:19:03.868 --> 02:19:04.869
LIKE THAT IT'S A MUST MUCH

02:19:04.936 --> 02:19:07.272
SOFTER FACILITY. AND WE'RE

02:19:07.338 --> 02:19:08.039
REALLY NOT TALKING ABOUT

02:19:08.106 --> 02:19:12.377
BUILDING. MORE CELLS BECAUSE WE

02:19:12.444 --> 02:19:13.011
KNOW THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO GO.

02:19:13.078 --> 02:19:14.012
SO OKAY THAT WAS MY SECOND

02:19:14.079 --> 02:19:16.881
QUESTION. MMHM THIS IS A LEVINE

02:19:16.948 --> 02:19:19.451
DOESN'T HAVE CELLS. CORRECT

02:19:19.517 --> 02:19:22.921
RIGHT OKAY- BECAUSE I HAVE.

02:19:22.987 --> 02:19:25.056
VISITED SOME PLACES IN OTHER

02:19:25.123 --> 02:19:26.958
COUNTRIES WHERE IT'S A MUCH

02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:28.259
SOFTER FACILITIES SIMILAR TO

02:19:28.326 --> 02:19:29.227
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:19:29.294 --> 02:19:29.928
ALMOST LIKE AN APARTMENT

02:19:29.994 --> 02:19:32.163
BUILDING BUT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO

02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:34.632
COME AND GO AT NIGHT MAYBE THEY

02:19:34.699 --> 02:19:37.702
HAVE TO COME IN AND STAY- SO I

02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:39.070
GUESS I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS

02:19:39.137 --> 02:19:41.206
AN OPTION OR IF THAT. IF

02:19:41.272 --> 02:19:42.440
THERE'S SOME SORT OF STRUCTURE

02:19:42.507 --> 02:19:44.609
THAT'S FLEXIBLE DEPENDING ON

02:19:44.676 --> 02:19:47.378
YOUR PROGRESS- IF YOU STILL

02:19:47.445 --> 02:19:48.580
HAVE TO REMAIN LOCKED UP

02:19:48.646 --> 02:19:49.848
BECAUSE I ALSO THINK ONE OF THE

02:19:49.914 --> 02:19:51.216
CHALLENGES WITH FOLKS WHO ARE

02:19:51.282 --> 02:19:52.817
RECUPERATING OR RECOVERING FROM

02:19:52.884 --> 02:19:54.185
ADDICTION IS HOW THEY'RE ABLE

02:19:54.252 --> 02:19:55.754
TO DEAL IN THE REAL WORLD. IN

02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:56.554
THE REAL WORLD ISN'T

02:19:56.621 --> 02:19:57.922
NECESSARILY A LOCKED FACILITY

02:19:57.989 --> 02:19:59.758
FROM TEAM MINDS THEY DO HAVE TO

02:19:59.824 --> 02:20:01.292
SORT OF INTERACT WITH SOME OF

02:20:01.359 --> 02:20:03.495
THE YOU KNOW. FIGURING OUT HOW

02:20:03.561 --> 02:20:04.028
TO MANAGE THEIR TRIGGERS

02:20:04.095 --> 02:20:06.831
OUTSIDE- SO I DON'T KNOW IF

02:20:06.898 --> 02:20:10.935
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS- ALSO

02:20:11.002 --> 02:20:11.870
OR COULD BE TAKEN INTO

02:20:11.936 --> 02:20:13.071
CONSIDERATION BECAUSE I KNOW

02:20:13.138 --> 02:20:14.973
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE

02:20:15.039 --> 02:20:18.243
OPPOSITION- HAVE IS THAT. IT'S

02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:20.678
NOT IT'S A JAIL NOT POSING AS A

02:20:20.745 --> 02:20:22.380
JAIL BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL NOT

02:20:22.447 --> 02:20:26.084
ABLE TO GO AND SOME OF YOUR

02:20:26.151 --> 02:20:29.754
CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE- TAKEN. SO

02:20:29.821 --> 02:20:31.523
AS IS THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION

02:20:31.589 --> 02:20:32.924
I GUESS BASED ON PROGRESS THAT

02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:34.793
YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE UNDERTAKEN

02:20:34.859 --> 02:20:36.761
WITHIN THIS TREATMENT FACILITY.

02:20:36.828 --> 02:20:37.896
SO THE ONLY WAY CENTER YOU

02:20:37.962 --> 02:20:39.264
COULD EQUATE THIS TO JAIL IS

02:20:39.330 --> 02:20:40.799
THE FACT THAT THE PERSON CAN'T

02:20:40.865 --> 02:20:41.900
COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE

02:20:41.966 --> 02:20:42.967
WHICH IS WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND

02:20:43.034 --> 02:20:44.803
CENTER AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW. IN

02:20:44.869 --> 02:20:46.404
MOST RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES YOU

02:20:46.471 --> 02:20:48.072
HAVE A BLACKOUT PERIOD AND

02:20:48.139 --> 02:20:50.041
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE.

02:20:50.108 --> 02:20:51.376
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID LIKE

02:20:51.442 --> 02:20:52.677
THOSE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES

02:20:52.744 --> 02:20:54.879
WITH BLACKOUTS IS. THE

02:20:54.946 --> 02:20:55.780
INDIVIDUAL HAVING A CHANGE OF

02:20:55.847 --> 02:20:58.149
HEART- THAT SAME EVENING OR

02:20:58.216 --> 02:21:00.485
THAT SAME DAY THE NEXT DAY AND

02:21:00.552 --> 02:21:03.688
LEAVING- SO. IT WOULD BE LOCKED

02:21:03.755 --> 02:21:06.024
COULD WE HAVE STEPPED DOWN

02:21:06.090 --> 02:21:07.625
WHERE MAYBE PEOPLE COULD COME

02:21:07.692 --> 02:21:09.194
AND GO AS THEY PLEASE JUST LIKE

02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:10.328
THEY DO AT RESIDENTIAL

02:21:10.395 --> 02:21:13.231
FACILITIES AS YOU. AS YOU.

02:21:13.298 --> 02:21:15.633
SUCCEED YES WE COULD POSSIBLY

02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:19.938
CONSIDER THAT- BUT INITIALLY-

02:21:20.004 --> 02:21:21.773
WE ENVISION THAT IT WOULD BE A

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:25.577
PLACE WHERE. THE PEOPLE INSIDE

02:21:25.643 --> 02:21:26.744
COULD NOT COME AND GO. AS A

02:21:26.811 --> 02:21:30.481
PLEASE. SO WHAT ELSE WOULD BE

02:21:30.548 --> 02:21:33.384
HAPPENING IN THIS FACILITY.

02:21:33.451 --> 02:21:35.553
IT'S JUST LIKE ANY OTHER

02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:37.088
RESIDENTIAL FACILITY THEY WOULD

02:21:37.155 --> 02:21:40.158
HAVE- BUT INDIVIDUAL THERAPY

02:21:40.225 --> 02:21:41.693
SESSIONSTHEY WOULD HAVE GROUP

02:21:41.759 --> 02:21:43.962
THERAPY THEY WOULD LEARN LIFE

02:21:44.028 --> 02:21:47.031
SKILLS THEY WOULD LEARN HOW-

02:21:47.098 --> 02:21:49.267
HOW TO HOW TO SUCCEED ON THE

02:21:49.334 --> 02:21:51.703
OUTSIDE- YOU KNOW WITHOUT GOING

02:21:51.769 --> 02:21:55.340
BACK TO. TO USING- THEY WOULD

02:21:55.406 --> 02:21:57.108
LEARN ABOUT THEIR TRIGGERS THEY

02:21:57.175 --> 02:21:59.978
WOULD LEARN ABOUT- SAFETY PLANS

02:22:00.044 --> 02:22:01.980
YOU KNOW ALL THESE DIFFERENT

02:22:02.046 --> 02:22:02.480
THINGS IT WOULD BE VERY

02:22:02.547 --> 02:22:04.649
INTENSIVE ALMOST LIKE AN

02:22:04.716 --> 02:22:06.618
INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM-

02:22:06.684 --> 02:22:09.053
BUT IT WOULD BE IMPATIENT AND

02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:10.655
YOU KNOW YOU YOU THE THING IS

02:22:10.722 --> 02:22:13.258
YOU DON'T IT'S VERY TIRING- TO

02:22:13.324 --> 02:22:14.726
HAVE ALL THIS THERAPY AND ALL

02:22:14.792 --> 02:22:16.027
THESE GROUPS THAT WE DON'T WANT

02:22:16.094 --> 02:22:19.197
TO. OVERDO IT WITH THEM BUT-

02:22:19.264 --> 02:22:21.032
THEY'RE PROBABLY UP THE ALSO-

02:22:21.099 --> 02:22:22.834
DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE

02:22:22.901 --> 02:22:24.369
THAT REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO DO

02:22:24.435 --> 02:22:26.671
WITH- THE TREATMENT SO THEY

02:22:26.738 --> 02:22:29.207
WOULD BE KEPT BUSY- THEY WOULD

02:22:29.274 --> 02:22:30.508
HAVE CERTAINLY FREE TIME BUT

02:22:30.575 --> 02:22:33.244
THEY WOULD BE DOING A LOT OF

02:22:33.311 --> 02:22:37.282
WORK ON TO GET BETTER- I WANT

02:22:37.348 --> 02:22:38.516
TO ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS

02:22:38.583 --> 02:22:39.517
THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

02:22:39.584 --> 02:22:41.119
FRANCISCO MENTION ABOUT THE

02:22:41.185 --> 02:22:42.453
JUDGE BEING ABLE TO DETERMINE

02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:44.455
THE LENGTH OF TREATMENT AS I'D

02:22:44.522 --> 02:22:46.391
READ- THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL

02:22:46.457 --> 02:22:47.825
IT SAYS JUST AFTER IT SAYS THAT

02:22:47.892 --> 02:22:48.960
THE JUDGE IS ABLE TO DETERMINE

02:22:49.027 --> 02:22:51.763
THE LENGTH OF TREATMENT- AFTER

02:22:51.829 --> 02:22:54.899
BEING INFORMED BY. ASSESSMENTS

02:22:54.966 --> 02:22:55.400
AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF

02:22:55.466 --> 02:22:57.068
TREATMENT PROVIDERS WHICH

02:22:57.135 --> 02:22:58.536
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT

02:22:58.603 --> 02:23:02.373
THEY HAVE TO- ADHERE TO THE

02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:04.442
RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO I WOULD

02:23:04.509 --> 02:23:05.343
HOPE THAT THERE COULD BE SOME

02:23:05.410 --> 02:23:07.045
TIGHTENING WITH REGARDS TO

02:23:07.111 --> 02:23:10.148
THAT- BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT YOU

02:23:10.214 --> 02:23:14.585
DON'T WANT ACTIVISTS JUDGES BUT

02:23:14.652 --> 02:23:17.155
I THINK- IT'S ABOUT

02:23:17.221 --> 02:23:19.824
INDIVIDUALIZED AND CUSTOMIZED.

02:23:19.891 --> 02:23:21.059
TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND THE

02:23:21.125 --> 02:23:23.661
REALITY IS THAT MOST OFTEN WHEN

02:23:23.728 --> 02:23:26.431
JUDGES ARE SENTENCING. IT'S

02:23:26.497 --> 02:23:27.565
THEIR FORMULAS YOU KNOW IT'S

02:23:27.632 --> 02:23:28.700
LIKE THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS

02:23:28.766 --> 02:23:31.469
NINE YEARS PLUS. AND SO THIS

02:23:31.536 --> 02:23:34.072
ISN'T THAT I DON'T THINK WE'RE

02:23:34.138 --> 02:23:36.107
TRYING TO MAKE IT THAT SO. I

02:23:36.174 --> 02:23:37.875
WOULD JUST LIKE THERE TO BE A

02:23:37.942 --> 02:23:39.911
LITTLE MORE CLARITY WITH

02:23:39.978 --> 02:23:43.448
REGARDS TO- HOW THE

02:23:43.514 --> 02:23:45.817
DETERMINATIONS ARE MADE BECAUSE

02:23:45.883 --> 02:23:47.085
THIS DOES GIVE A LOT OF

02:23:47.151 --> 02:23:48.786
FLEXIBILITY TO JUDGES AND WE

02:23:48.853 --> 02:23:50.755
KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES AIR ON

02:23:50.822 --> 02:23:52.090
SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH MORE

02:23:52.156 --> 02:23:55.994
CONSERVATIVE- SO I WOULD LIKE

02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:57.628
FOR THAT TO BE RE LOOKED AT

02:23:57.695 --> 02:23:59.731
AGAIN AND THEN. HOW SUCCESS IS

02:23:59.797 --> 02:24:01.933
DEFINED TREATMENT SUCCESSES

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:05.970
ALSO REALLY VAGUE- WHATDOES

02:24:06.037 --> 02:24:07.071
SUCCESS LOOK LIKE THAT YOU

02:24:07.138 --> 02:24:08.473
NEVER RELAPSE THAT YOU DON'T

02:24:08.539 --> 02:24:09.540
RELAPSE WHILE YOU'RE THERE WHAT

02:24:09.607 --> 02:24:10.808
HAPPENS WHEN YOU COME OUT IF

02:24:10.875 --> 02:24:12.010
YOU COME OUT AND THEN YOU

02:24:12.076 --> 02:24:13.978
RELAPSE ARE YOU PICKED UP WHAT

02:24:14.045 --> 02:24:15.480
WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

02:24:15.546 --> 02:24:16.814
THIS TREATMENT CENTER AND CDC

02:24:16.881 --> 02:24:19.283
ARE IN PROBATION. I WOULD SAY

02:24:19.350 --> 02:24:20.118
THAT I DON'T THINK THAT

02:24:20.184 --> 02:24:21.853
PROBATION IS NECESSARILY

02:24:21.919 --> 02:24:25.423
TRAINED NOR CDC ARE- TRAIN TO

02:24:25.490 --> 02:24:27.592
KIND OF DO THAT. MONITORING AND

02:24:27.658 --> 02:24:29.761
SUPPORT AS IT WHEN SOMEONE GETS

02:24:29.827 --> 02:24:33.297
OUT- IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MOCK

02:24:33.364 --> 02:24:36.834
YOU KNOW HELP THEM CONTINUE.

02:24:36.901 --> 02:24:38.936
THERE SUCCESSFUL POSTTREATMENT

02:24:39.003 --> 02:24:42.006
JOURNEY SO CAN YOU KIND OF

02:24:42.073 --> 02:24:42.840
THREE TO THE RELATIONSHIP

02:24:42.907 --> 02:24:44.542
BETWEEN THIS TREATMENT A AND C.

02:24:44.609 --> 02:24:48.579
D. C. R. AND B. PROBATION. SO I

02:24:48.646 --> 02:24:50.681
THINK M. NONE OF US WANT CDC

02:24:50.748 --> 02:24:52.216
ARE INVOLVED IN THIS OTHER THAN

02:24:52.283 --> 02:24:54.252
THE REPORTING THAT'S THE ONLY

02:24:54.318 --> 02:24:55.953
REASON WHY THEY'RE MENTIONED-

02:24:56.020 --> 02:24:58.423
IN THE BILL SO- I THINK THAT'S

02:24:58.489 --> 02:25:00.191
WHAT WE NONE OF US WANT THAT WE

02:25:00.258 --> 02:25:02.060
DON'T NEED CITY SARGSYAN. CDC

02:25:02.126 --> 02:25:04.929
ARE INVOLVED. THE MONITORING

02:25:04.996 --> 02:25:06.297
AND THIS IS KIND OF AND- I'M

02:25:06.364 --> 02:25:07.098
TRYING TO USE THE RIGHT

02:25:07.165 --> 02:25:08.800
LANGUAGE THE MONITORING WOULD

02:25:08.866 --> 02:25:09.700
BE DONE BY THE HEALTH CARE

02:25:09.767 --> 02:25:13.504
PRACTITIONERS. BUT OUR- HEALTH

02:25:13.571 --> 02:25:14.439
AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY

02:25:14.505 --> 02:25:16.441
DIRECTOR SHE HAD A LOT OF

02:25:16.507 --> 02:25:18.242
REALLY GOOD FEEDBACK FOR US IN

02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:19.977
TERMS OF MAKING TO BUILD MORE

02:25:20.044 --> 02:25:21.946
MORE PALATABLE. AND HELPING US

02:25:22.013 --> 02:25:24.015
WITH THE LANGUAGE AND WHAT SHE

02:25:24.082 --> 02:25:25.283
TOLD US WHICH MAKES TOTAL SENSE

02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:28.119
IS THAT- PROBATION SHOULD IS

02:25:28.186 --> 02:25:28.853
THAT THE HEALTH CARE

02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:30.121
PRACTITIONER SHOULD NOT BE

02:25:30.188 --> 02:25:32.857
SUPERVISING. THEIR CLIENTS

02:25:32.924 --> 02:25:34.125
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE THIS

02:25:34.192 --> 02:25:35.827
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR CLIENTS

02:25:35.893 --> 02:25:37.929
AND IF THEY START GOING TO THE

02:25:37.995 --> 02:25:40.298
JUDGE AND SAYING. YOU KNOW. JOE

02:25:40.364 --> 02:25:41.532
IS NOT FOLLOWING THE TREATMENT

02:25:41.599 --> 02:25:43.701
PLAN THEN THEY'RE GOING TO.

02:25:43.768 --> 02:25:46.838
LOSE THAT RELATIONSHIP SO THE-

02:25:46.904 --> 02:25:48.906
MONITORING WOULD BE DONE BY.

02:25:48.973 --> 02:25:50.608
THAT HEALTH PRACTITIONERS BUT

02:25:50.675 --> 02:25:52.743
THE SUPERVISION WOULD BE DONE

02:25:52.810 --> 02:25:54.112
BY PROBATION AND THAT WAS

02:25:54.178 --> 02:25:55.379
SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE

02:25:55.446 --> 02:25:56.414
AMENDED OR CHANGED AT SOME

02:25:56.481 --> 02:25:58.282
POINT. UPON THE RECOMMENDATION

02:25:58.349 --> 02:26:00.585
OF OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:26:00.651 --> 02:26:02.987
SERVICES. DIRECTOR YOU HAD A

02:26:03.054 --> 02:26:05.056
FEW MORE QUESTIONS AS WELL SO

02:26:05.123 --> 02:26:05.857
YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION ABOUT

02:26:05.923 --> 02:26:08.059
CCR. I'M LISTENING TO YOUR

02:26:08.126 --> 02:26:10.161
RESPONSE ABOUT PROBATION. BUT

02:26:10.228 --> 02:26:12.063
YOU KNOW THE OTHER REALITY IS

02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:13.865
THAT I OFTENTIMES PROBATION YOU

02:26:13.931 --> 02:26:16.200
KNOW THEIR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS

02:26:16.267 --> 02:26:17.135
THAT COME FROM PROBATIONERS

02:26:17.201 --> 02:26:19.203
RIGHT. NOT PROVISIONS BUT FROM

02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:20.872
THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT. AND

02:26:20.938 --> 02:26:22.473
IT'S REALLY HARD TO SORT OF ON

02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:24.075
LEARNED BEHAVIOR RIGHT BASED ON

02:26:24.142 --> 02:26:25.643
HOW YOU RUN YOUR DEPARTMENT IT

02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:28.746
JUST IS. AND SO DO YOU WOULD

02:26:28.813 --> 02:26:29.714
NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO

02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:31.215
CONSIDERATION BECAUSE THE GOAL

02:26:31.282 --> 02:26:34.719
IS NOT TO. CREATE A NEW- SYSTEM

02:26:34.785 --> 02:26:36.154
BUT THEN AN ADVERT ONLY KIND OF

02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:37.655
CREATE THESE FINALS AT LEAD

02:26:37.722 --> 02:26:39.223
BACK TO THE OLD SYSTEM THE IDEA

02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:40.958
IS TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM AND

02:26:41.025 --> 02:26:44.195
THEN PILOT THIS OUT. IN A WAY

02:26:44.262 --> 02:26:44.762
THAT'S LIKE USING DIFFERENT

02:26:44.829 --> 02:26:47.031
PARTNERS. DO YOU KNOW REGARD

02:26:47.098 --> 02:26:49.333
TRAINING. THEM TO DO DIFFERENT

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:51.002
THINGS OR MAYBE JUST NOT EVEN

02:26:51.068 --> 02:26:52.937
USING THEM AT ALL. SO THAT YOU

02:26:53.004 --> 02:26:54.639
CAN CREATE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES

02:26:54.705 --> 02:26:55.640
B. YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE OTHER

02:26:55.706 --> 02:26:57.508
REALITY IS IF YOU'VE BEEN

02:26:57.575 --> 02:26:58.276
CONVICTED OF THIS AND YOU OPT

02:26:58.342 --> 02:27:00.077
TO DO THE TREATMENT. CHANCES

02:27:00.144 --> 02:27:01.445
ARE YOU'RE NOT A FIRST TIMER

02:27:01.512 --> 02:27:02.947
CHANCES ARE YOU'VE ALREADY HAD

02:27:03.014 --> 02:27:04.081
SOME PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP

02:27:04.148 --> 02:27:05.816
WITH THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT.

02:27:05.883 --> 02:27:08.686
SO CHANCES ARE. YOU DON'T HAVE

02:27:08.753 --> 02:27:11.522
A GREAT SORT OF RELATIONSHIP OR

02:27:11.589 --> 02:27:13.224
THERE ISN'T A HIGH LEVEL OF

02:27:13.291 --> 02:27:13.891
CREDIBILITY WITH THAT

02:27:13.958 --> 02:27:16.327
DEPARTMENT- OR WITH SOME OF THE

02:27:16.394 --> 02:27:18.462
FOLKS THAT ARE WORKING IN

02:27:18.529 --> 02:27:20.364
THERE. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP.

02:27:20.431 --> 02:27:26.237
RIGHT SO- WE EXPECT RELAPSES

02:27:26.304 --> 02:27:28.306
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WE EXPECT

02:27:28.372 --> 02:27:30.408
TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS IT'S NOT

02:27:30.474 --> 02:27:32.143
GOING TO BE AN ELEVATOR GOING

02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:33.711
TO THE TOP GOING TO BE AN

02:27:33.778 --> 02:27:36.581
ESCALATOR AND SO WE HAVE A

02:27:36.647 --> 02:27:38.149
MENTAL HEALTH COURT WE HAVE AN

02:27:38.216 --> 02:27:40.284
ADDICTION INTERVENTION COURT-

02:27:40.351 --> 02:27:41.419
THESE ARE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:27:41.485 --> 02:27:43.554
BEING TREATED SAFELY OUT IN THE

02:27:43.621 --> 02:27:46.023
COMMUNITY BUT IN THAT COURT WE

02:27:46.090 --> 02:27:48.125
HAVE A TEAM WE ALL WORK

02:27:48.192 --> 02:27:50.561
TOGETHER SO- HE ALSO HIT THE

02:27:50.628 --> 02:27:51.862
NAIL ON THE HEAD WHEN YOU SAID-

02:27:51.929 --> 02:27:53.130
ACTUALLY WAS YOU CENTER THIS

02:27:53.197 --> 02:27:54.632
DISTRUST AND THAT'S A REAL

02:27:54.699 --> 02:27:56.801
SHAME THAT WE HAVE THAT- JUST

02:27:56.867 --> 02:27:58.636
BECAUSE THE DA. HAS WRITTEN A

02:27:58.703 --> 02:27:59.737
LANGUAGE FOR A BILL IT'S A

02:27:59.804 --> 02:28:00.871
SHAME THAT PEOPLE CAN GET

02:28:00.938 --> 02:28:03.107
BEHIND IT I KNOW IN OUR COUNTY

02:28:03.174 --> 02:28:04.308
AND OUR PROGRAMS WE HAVE A LOT

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:05.810
OF TRUST. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES

02:28:05.876 --> 02:28:08.112
THEM WORK SO THE BOTTOM LINE

02:28:08.179 --> 02:28:10.314
IS- SOMEONE AS A TECHNICAL

02:28:10.381 --> 02:28:11.849
VIOLATION SOMEONE HAS A RELAPSE

02:28:11.916 --> 02:28:12.884
THAT'S NO REASON TO KICK HIM

02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:14.785
OUT OF THE PROGRAM IF THEY

02:28:14.852 --> 02:28:17.088
COMPLETELY DISENGAGE. AND DON'T

02:28:17.154 --> 02:28:18.889
FOLLOW ANY OF THE TREATMENT

02:28:18.956 --> 02:28:21.025
PLANS AFTER AFTER OPPORTUNITIES

02:28:21.092 --> 02:28:22.994
TO DO THAT. THEN MAYBE THEY

02:28:23.060 --> 02:28:24.128
SHOULDN'T BE THERE AND MAYBE

02:28:24.195 --> 02:28:25.997
THEY RE IN A SENSE BY THEIR

02:28:26.063 --> 02:28:27.198
ACTIONS THEY'RE OPTING NOT TO

02:28:27.265 --> 02:28:30.601
BE THERE RIGHT. SO AS I SAID.

02:28:30.668 --> 02:28:32.770
WE YOU ANYONE IN A TREATMENT

02:28:32.837 --> 02:28:37.074
FACILITY WHICH THIS IS EXPECTS

02:28:37.141 --> 02:28:37.642
RELAPSES THAT'S THAT'S WHAT

02:28:37.708 --> 02:28:42.079
HAPPENS. HOUSES FUNDED- SO THE

02:28:42.146 --> 02:28:44.081
FUNDING IS NOT QITE CLEAR YET

02:28:44.148 --> 02:28:45.716
BUT- I KNOW WHAT WE WERE

02:28:45.783 --> 02:28:48.052
LOOKING TO THE- OPIOID CELLUM

02:28:48.119 --> 02:28:49.420
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT OF COURSE

02:28:49.487 --> 02:28:50.388
THERE HAVE TO BE AN

02:28:50.454 --> 02:28:50.855
APPROPRIATION BY THE

02:28:50.921 --> 02:28:52.923
LEGISLATURE FOR THAT- THAT'S

02:28:52.990 --> 02:28:56.260
ONE OF THE OPTIONS. OKAY I

02:28:56.327 --> 02:28:57.895
APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING THESE

02:28:57.962 --> 02:29:04.635
QUESTIONS- I AM. YOU KNOW I'M

02:29:04.702 --> 02:29:06.170
PROBABLY GOING TO WAIT UNTIL IT

02:29:06.237 --> 02:29:07.571
GETS TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE MY

02:29:07.638 --> 02:29:08.572
HOPE IS THAT I CAN SEE SOME OF

02:29:08.639 --> 02:29:09.974
THE RESPONSES TO SOME OF THE

02:29:10.041 --> 02:29:11.676
QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED AND ALSO

02:29:11.742 --> 02:29:12.943
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE

02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:14.979
SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO ASK

02:29:15.046 --> 02:29:16.547
BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

HELP YELLOW BE SERVING TIME IN

02:31:42.326 --> 02:31:44.962
JAIL OR PRISON- THEY'RE NOT THE

02:31:45.029 --> 02:31:47.431
POPULATION THAT WOULD BE

02:31:47.498 --> 02:31:49.934
SUITABLE FOR BEING TREATED IN

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:53.504
THE COMMUNITY. ALL RIGHT AND-

02:31:53.571 --> 02:31:56.207

02:32:07.852 --> 02:32:09.954
MORE OF A COWORKERS AND THEN A

02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:13.157
VOLUNTEER SITUATION SO CAN YOU

02:32:13.224 --> 02:32:15.893

THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THOSE

02:32:17.328 --> 02:32:18.896
ADVOCATE TO DO THIS WORK ON A

02:32:18.963 --> 02:32:20.164
DAILY BASIS AND YOU WOULD

02:32:20.231 --> 02:32:21.932
THINK. THEY WOULD BE STRONG

02:32:21.999 --> 02:32:24.502
SUPPORTERS OF SUCH A PROGRAM

02:32:24.568 --> 02:32:25.369
BUT THEY SEEM TO HAVE GREAT

02:32:25.436 --> 02:32:28.706
CONCERN. AT ALL I'LL TAKE A

02:32:28.772 --> 02:32:31.642
CRACK AT THAT- AGAIN THIS IS A

02:32:31.709 --> 02:32:34.979
VOLUNTARY EFFORT. THAT WE DID

02:32:35.045 --> 02:32:37.181
PUT IN THE BILL THAT SOMEONE

02:32:37.248 --> 02:32:39.083
HAS ENOUGH SECOND THOUGHT HAD

02:32:39.149 --> 02:32:41.819
BACKS OUT. THE DAY BEFORE ONCE

02:32:41.886 --> 02:32:43.854
THEY ENTER THEY CAN THEY CAN

02:32:43.921 --> 02:32:45.523
REVERT TO. BUT AGAIN THEY'RE

02:32:45.589 --> 02:32:47.024
NOT REVERTING GOING BACK ON THE

02:32:47.091 --> 02:32:48.158
CLOSER THEIR UNDERLYING

02:32:48.225 --> 02:32:49.660
SENTENCE BUT ARGUE THAT MANY

02:32:49.727 --> 02:32:52.062
TIMES LIKE AS SENATOR CONGRESS

02:32:52.129 --> 02:32:53.898
SAID. MANY FAMILIES WE'VE WE'VE

02:32:53.964 --> 02:32:55.199
HAD PEOPLE YOU HAD TO HAVE

02:32:55.266 --> 02:32:57.234
INTERVENTIONS. THOSE ARE KIND

02:32:57.301 --> 02:32:59.203
OF ARTICLE WORSENS OR THE

02:32:59.270 --> 02:33:00.337
CONTROLLING SOMEONE TO MAKE A

02:33:00.404 --> 02:33:02.640
DECISION PROBABLY. THIS ISN'T

02:33:02.706 --> 02:33:04.608
YOU KNOW SAYING CHOOSE THIS OR

02:33:04.675 --> 02:33:06.610
ELSE BUT IT'S PROVIDING I

02:33:06.677 --> 02:33:08.379
THINK. AN OPTION WE'D LIKE

02:33:08.445 --> 02:33:09.747
PEOPLE TO TAKE THIS OPTION

02:33:09.813 --> 02:33:10.814
BECAUSE ONE THEY CAN GET

02:33:10.881 --> 02:33:12.616
BETTER. FOR THEMSELVES FOR

02:33:12.683 --> 02:33:13.450
THEIR FAMILY AND FOR A

02:33:13.517 --> 02:33:15.319
COMMUNITY AND AS I TALKED WITH

02:33:15.386 --> 02:33:16.854
SENATOR WIENER ABOUT EARLIER

02:33:16.921 --> 02:33:17.588
RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT WHEN IT

02:33:17.655 --> 02:33:19.523
SAYS. THEY DOING THIS THEY

02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:21.725
WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE A LOT OF

02:33:21.792 --> 02:33:24.128
A SHORTER TERM. IN IN THE

02:33:24.194 --> 02:33:28.165
SYSTEM AS WELL SO. IT IT'S NOT-

02:33:28.232 --> 02:33:29.733
COERCE WE INCENTIVIZED

02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:30.935
HOPEFULLY PEOPLE TO MAKE THIS

02:33:31.001 --> 02:33:32.136
DECISION AND I WOULD THINK IT'S

02:33:32.202 --> 02:33:33.938
A SOUND DECISION AS WELL. AND

02:33:34.004 --> 02:33:35.773
IF AND THE FLIP SIDE WHAT'S THE

02:33:35.839 --> 02:33:37.474
ALTERNATE BEING INCARCERATED.

02:33:37.541 --> 02:33:38.509
WITH NO TREATMENT WOULD

02:33:38.576 --> 02:33:39.777
PROBABLY ACCESS TO DRUGS AND

02:33:39.843 --> 02:33:41.378
FORTUNATELY IN OUR STATE PRISON

02:33:41.445 --> 02:33:45.683
SYSTEM. IN COUNTY JAILS

02:33:45.749 --> 02:33:46.250
UNFORTUNATE HAPPENS ANYWAY.

02:33:46.317 --> 02:33:48.352
MMHM WILL THE WAS QUITE THE- I

02:33:48.419 --> 02:33:49.720
DIDN'T THAT IT WOULD SHORTEN

02:33:49.787 --> 02:33:52.022
YOUR TERM- IT WAS KIND OF LIKE

02:33:52.089 --> 02:33:53.057
A LITTLE WHILE. THERE ON

02:33:53.123 --> 02:33:54.792
WHETHER YOU WOULD HAVE A SHORT

02:33:54.858 --> 02:33:56.694
PERIOD OF TIME SIR BASED ON THE

02:33:56.760 --> 02:33:58.295
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS IT SOONER

02:33:58.362 --> 02:33:59.964
PALM HARBOR- SO I WOULD HOPE

02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:01.832
THAT WE CAN DEFINE THAT THAT IF

02:34:01.899 --> 02:34:04.101
A PERSON CLEARLY- COMPLETES THE

02:34:04.168 --> 02:34:08.038
PROGRAM THAT HE OR SHE- WOULD

02:34:08.105 --> 02:34:09.039
HAVE A REDUCE TIME TO BE SURE.

02:34:09.106 --> 02:34:14.111
AND IT YOU KNOW- I SEE A NEED

02:34:14.178 --> 02:34:15.446
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE

02:34:15.512 --> 02:34:17.848
AS YOU STATED. THE MAJORITY OF

02:34:17.915 --> 02:34:21.251
PEOPLE WHO GO TO PRISON WHO. GO

02:34:21.318 --> 02:34:23.387
THERE WITH AN ADDICTION USUALLY

02:34:23.454 --> 02:34:24.688
GET OUT WITH THAT SAME

02:34:24.755 --> 02:34:26.123
ADDICTION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:28.192
REAL REHABILITATION AND OUR

02:34:28.258 --> 02:34:29.893
PRISON SYSTEMS IN OUR JAIL

02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:32.162
SYSTEM SO THIS AFFORDS

02:34:32.229 --> 02:34:34.765
OPPORTUNITY FOR REHABILITATION

02:34:34.832 --> 02:34:38.869

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:46.343

02:34:48.445 --> 02:34:49.213
ONE OF THOSE SCENARIOS WHERE WE

02:34:49.279 --> 02:34:51.782

EXACTLY WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE.

03:08:51.486 --> 03:08:52.654
SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW

03:08:52.721 --> 03:08:54.523
TO HOW TO HAVE A MORE EFFICIENT

03:08:54.589 --> 03:08:57.459

RATING THE WALLETS OF OUR

03:08:58.860 --> 03:09:00.929
TAXPAYERS. AND DELIVERING

03:09:00.996 --> 03:09:02.497
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT OF HIGH

03:09:02.564 --> 03:09:04.466
VALUE. YOU KNOW I ALSO WANT TO

03:09:10.439 --> 03:09:12.040
BILL THAT CAME TO US NOT LONG

03:09:12.107 --> 03:09:13.875
AGO THAT. WAS TALKING ABOUT

03:09:13.942 --> 03:09:17.012
PAYING BACK FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN

03:09:17.079 --> 03:09:19.047
WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND

03:09:19.114 --> 03:09:22.384
INCARCERATED AND THE COST WAS A

03:09:22.451 --> 03:09:24.219
HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS A DAY

03:09:24.286 --> 03:09:26.822
AND I SUBMIT THAT IT COSTS MORE

03:09:26.888 --> 03:09:27.656
THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY

03:09:27.723 --> 03:09:29.524
DOLLARS A DAY. TO INCARCERATE

03:09:29.591 --> 03:09:31.660

THERE TO BE SOME GREATER

03:09:49.711 --> 03:09:51.446
TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW MUCH IT

03:09:51.513 --> 03:09:54.549
COSTS TO RUN- SO THAT PEOPLE

03:09:54.616 --> 03:09:55.317

SITUATION IN WHICH A JUDGE

03:11:19.467 --> 03:11:21.136

TO TAKE COST INTO CONSIDERATION

03:11:22.270 --> 03:11:23.805
AT THIS POINT BUT THERE MAY BE

03:11:23.872 --> 03:11:24.940
SITUATIONS WHERE A JUDGE IN

SUBSTANCE IS NOT REALLY GOING

03:11:33.915 --> 03:11:35.417
TO BENEFIT TAXPAYERS IS A

03:11:35.483 --> 03:11:36.718
REALLY GOING TO BENEFIT PUBLIC

03:11:42.090 --> 03:11:43.358
300-100-0500 THOUSAND DOLLARS

03:11:43.425 --> 03:11:44.192

03:14:12.741 --> 03:14:15.043
DISPARITY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT.

03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:18.313
THE ALMOST 90% OF THE KIDS ON

OF COLOR AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT

03:14:27.989 --> 03:14:29.858
THE CONDITIONS THAT THESE KIDS

SB FIVE OH THREE IS TO SET SOME

03:14:52.147 --> 03:14:54.549

NECESSARILY SPEND ON PROBATION.

03:15:04.225 --> 03:15:05.427
BUT AT THE END OF SIX MONTHS IT

03:15:05.493 --> 03:15:07.796
WOULD NEED TO BE REVIEW. AND

03:15:07.862 --> 03:15:08.596
BASED ON THE PREPONDERANCE OF

03:15:08.663 --> 03:15:11.633
EVIDENCE. THAT CAN BE EXTENDED

03:15:11.699 --> 03:15:13.568
IF IT IS NECESSARY TO SERVE THE

03:15:13.635 --> 03:15:15.370
INTERESTS OF THE CHILD AND TO

03:15:15.437 --> 03:15:17.005
SERVE THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE.

03:15:17.072 --> 03:15:18.440

AGREE ON WE DO NOT AGREE THAT A

03:27:51.592 --> 03:27:53.794
PRESUMPTIVE SIX MONTH LIMIT ON

03:27:53.861 --> 03:27:56.230
PROBATION. IS THE APPROPRIATE

03:27:56.297 --> 03:27:58.432
TIME HOWEVER AND WE'VE HAD

03:27:58.499 --> 03:27:59.934
EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:02.937
THIS- JUVENILE COURT JUDGES IN

03:28:03.003 --> 03:28:04.305
CALIFORNIA ARE VERY VERY

03:28:04.371 --> 03:28:06.440
DEDICATED TO THE REHABILITATION

03:28:06.507 --> 03:28:08.676
OF YOUTH. A WE WERE A SPONSOR

03:28:08.742 --> 03:28:10.711
OF A BILL TO INCREASE DIVERSION

03:28:10.778 --> 03:28:13.581
FOR USE FOR EXAMPLE SB THREE

03:28:13.647 --> 03:28:15.850
EIGHTY THREE. BUT WE THINK THE

03:28:15.916 --> 03:28:17.718
SIX MONTH PERIOD IS TOO SHORT.

03:28:17.785 --> 03:28:19.787
AND IT WILL HAVE UNINTENDED

03:28:19.854 --> 03:28:21.622
EFFECTS IT COULD INCREASE

03:28:21.689 --> 03:28:23.924
CUSTODIAL TIME FOR YOU WHICH IS

03:28:23.991 --> 03:28:26.327
UNFORTUNATE UNINTENDED EFFECT

03:28:26.393 --> 03:28:28.762
IT COULD CAUSE MORE MOTIONS TO

03:28:28.829 --> 03:28:31.398
TRANSFER USED TO ADULT COURT

03:28:31.465 --> 03:28:32.433
WHICH WOULD BE AN UNFORTUNATE

03:28:32.499 --> 03:28:36.237
RESULT. WE SUGGEST THAT THE ONE

03:28:36.303 --> 03:28:38.639
YEAR. THAT WAS A PROPOSAL LAST

03:28:38.706 --> 03:28:39.640
YEAR IS A MORE APPROPRIATE

03:28:39.707 --> 03:28:42.509
TIME. AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE

03:28:42.576 --> 03:28:44.044
AT THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT

03:28:44.111 --> 03:28:46.213
THE BILL SAYS THAT AND WE

03:28:46.280 --> 03:28:47.781
APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT TAKING

03:28:47.848 --> 03:28:49.917
THE- PREPONDERANCE OF THE

03:28:49.984 --> 03:28:50.985
EVIDENCE STANDARD FOR

03:28:51.051 --> 03:28:52.386
OVERCOMING THE SIX MONTH

03:28:52.453 --> 03:28:54.021
PRESUMPTION. BUT THE

03:28:54.088 --> 03:28:56.056
PREPONDERANCE MUST SHOW THAT IT

03:28:56.123 --> 03:28:57.958
IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

03:28:58.025 --> 03:29:00.527
USE. AND THAT'S CONTRADICTORY

03:29:00.594 --> 03:29:03.430
TO. EXISTING LAWS IN WELFARE

03:29:03.497 --> 03:29:06.133
AND INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION

03:29:06.200 --> 03:29:07.968
TWO OH TWO WHICH APPLIES TO ALL

03:29:08.035 --> 03:29:08.569
JUVENILE PROCEEDINGS IN

03:29:08.636 --> 03:29:11.005
CALIFORNIA. THE LAW SPECIFIES

03:29:11.071 --> 03:29:14.975

AND PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC.

03:29:19.280 --> 03:29:20.681
PORTENTS OF REDRESSING INJURIES

03:29:20.748 --> 03:29:22.049
TO VICTIMS AND THE BEST

03:29:22.116 --> 03:29:23.918
INTERESTS OF THE MINOR IN ALL

03:29:23.984 --> 03:29:25.486
DELIBERATIONS PURSUANT TO THE

CHAPTER. AND THE BILL SAYS THAT

03:29:27.955 --> 03:29:30.891
THE- I MEAN CAN BE OVERCOME BY

03:29:30.958 --> 03:29:32.826
A PREPONDERANCE ONLY RELATING

03:29:32.893 --> 03:29:34.561
TO THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

03:29:34.628 --> 03:29:36.463
YOUTH WE THINK THAT THE JUDGE

03:29:36.530 --> 03:29:38.599
SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. ALL

03:29:38.666 --> 03:29:40.668
OF THOSE FACTORS IN SECTION TWO

03:29:40.734 --> 03:29:43.137
OH TWO. WE STILL BELIEVE THAT A

03:29:43.203 --> 03:29:45.239
YEAR IS THE APPROPRIATE LENGTH

03:29:45.306 --> 03:29:47.041
AND THAT THE PROTECTION OF THE

03:29:47.107 --> 03:29:50.110
PUBLIC. HAS TO BE PART OF THE

03:29:50.177 --> 03:29:52.446
CONSIDERATION FOR THE JUDGE IN

03:29:52.513 --> 03:29:53.447

TODAY WELL REALIZES BILLS MEN

03:34:57.451 --> 03:34:59.186
AND MEN IT SEVERAL TIMES TO TRY

03:34:59.253 --> 03:34:59.853
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE

03:34:59.920 --> 03:35:01.355
CONCERNS WE CHANGE THE STANDARD

03:35:01.421 --> 03:35:03.523
OF REVIEW AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE

03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:05.525
LOOKING AT. APPROPRIATE

03:35:05.592 --> 03:35:08.195
AMENDMENTS TO SET THAT STANDARD

03:35:08.262 --> 03:35:10.497
AT WHICH TO- TO BE ABLE TO USE

03:35:10.564 --> 03:35:12.399
THAT INSTEAD OF THE WHAT'S

03:35:12.466 --> 03:35:14.668
CURRENTLY IN THE BILL THE BEST

03:35:14.735 --> 03:35:15.269
INTEREST OF THE CHILD BECAUSE

03:35:15.335 --> 03:35:17.671
WE DO UNDERSTAND. THE

03:35:17.738 --> 03:35:19.373
FLEXIBILITY BEING ASKED THERE.

03:35:19.439 --> 03:35:21.074
THE SIX MONTHS I THINK IS IT IS

03:35:21.141 --> 03:35:22.909
A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT.

03:35:22.976 --> 03:35:26.046
BECAUSE A YEAR IS A LONG TIME.

03:35:26.113 --> 03:35:27.714
IT RELIES IN SOME COUNTIES

03:35:27.781 --> 03:35:29.850
AVERAGE PROBATION IS SIX MONTHS

03:35:29.916 --> 03:35:31.285
IN SOME COUNTIES AVERAGE

03:35:31.351 --> 03:35:33.453
PROBATION TWO AND A HALF YEARS.

03:35:33.520 --> 03:35:35.088
SAME KINDS OF CRIMES SO WE'RE

03:35:35.155 --> 03:35:38.225
TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT POINT

03:35:38.292 --> 03:35:39.226
AT WHICH TO SET THAT

03:35:39.293 --> 03:35:41.595
PRESUMPTION AND IF THERE IS A

03:35:41.662 --> 03:35:44.197
SENTENCE FOR CIRCUMSTANCE THAT

03:35:44.264 --> 03:35:46.066
IS LONGER THAN THAT SIX MONTHS.

03:35:46.133 --> 03:35:48.001
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE IT

03:35:48.068 --> 03:35:49.770
COULD GO ANOTHER SIX MONTHS AGO

03:35:49.836 --> 03:35:52.139
ANOTHER SIX MONTHS AGO ANOTHER

03:35:52.205 --> 03:35:52.706
SIX MONTHS DEPENDING ON THE

03:35:52.773 --> 03:35:53.507
LENGTH OF TREATMENT THAT'S

03:35:53.573 --> 03:35:55.842
NEEDED. DEPENDING ON WHAT THE

03:35:55.909 --> 03:35:58.078
OUTOMES REALLY FAR BUT WHAT

03:35:58.145 --> 03:36:00.080
THIS IS SETTING UP IS THAT

03:36:00.147 --> 03:36:03.450
REVIEW. AT SIX MONTHS. UNDER

03:36:03.517 --> 03:36:04.685
THIS THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND

03:36:04.751 --> 03:36:05.952
AGAIN WE'RE WORKING ON

03:36:06.019 --> 03:36:08.255
AMENDMENTS AROUND WEEK TO- TO.

03:36:08.322 --> 03:36:09.156
TO LOOK AT THE PROGRESS OF THAT

03:36:09.222 --> 03:36:10.857
CHILD IS MAKING LOOK AT THE

03:36:10.924 --> 03:36:12.292
OTHER FACTORS SO IF THE

03:36:12.359 --> 03:36:13.460
TREATMENT GOES LONGER THAN SIX

03:36:13.527 --> 03:36:15.128
MONTHS THAT'S ABSOLUTELY BUILT

03:36:15.195 --> 03:36:16.596
IT. AND WHAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

03:36:16.663 --> 03:36:17.998
HERE IS THAT WE'RE CREATING

03:36:18.065 --> 03:36:19.299
DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR SETTING

03:36:19.366 --> 03:36:21.435
THOSE PROBATION CONDITIONS SO

03:36:21.501 --> 03:36:22.569
THAT THEY WILL BE MORE

03:36:22.636 --> 03:36:23.870
CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE

03:36:23.937 --> 03:36:26.206
WHICH I THINK YOU HEARD FROM

03:36:26.273 --> 03:36:26.707
THE JUDGES AND PROBATION

03:36:26.773 --> 03:36:28.809
OFFICERS. OR CONSISTENT WITH

03:36:28.875 --> 03:36:29.943
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AS

03:36:30.010 --> 03:36:32.012
WELL. WE'VE BEEN WORKING I

03:36:32.079 --> 03:36:33.613
THINK FAIRLY CLOSELY WITH THEM

03:36:33.680 --> 03:36:35.816
WE HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENTS. BUT

03:36:35.882 --> 03:36:37.150
WE'VE BEEN TAKING AMENDMENTS

03:36:37.217 --> 03:36:39.686
ALONG THE WAY TO TRY AND LISTEN

03:36:39.753 --> 03:36:41.355
TO THEIR CONCERNS UNDERSTAND

03:36:41.421 --> 03:36:42.622
WHAT THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

03:36:42.689 --> 03:36:43.457
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

03:36:43.523 --> 03:36:46.159
FACING. AND AN ADDRESS THOSE IN

03:36:46.226 --> 03:36:47.828
THE BILL BECAUSE THIS BILL IS

03:36:47.894 --> 03:36:50.030
REALLY ABOUT GIVING AS MUCH

03:36:50.097 --> 03:36:51.965
FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE. BUT

03:36:52.032 --> 03:36:55.102
PROVIDING CONSISTENCY ACROSS

03:36:55.168 --> 03:36:57.804
THE STATE COUNTY BY COUNTY SO

03:36:57.871 --> 03:36:59.373
THAT THERE IS A AN APPROPRIATE

03:36:59.439 --> 03:37:01.475
EXPECTATION. OF THE

03:37:01.541 --> 03:37:02.743
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THAT CHILD

03:37:02.809 --> 03:37:04.711
IS GOING TO FIND THEMSELVES IN

03:37:04.778 --> 03:37:05.545
IF THEY'RE IN A NONCUSTODIAL

03:37:05.612 --> 03:37:08.582
WARSHIP. WITH THE STATE SO WE

03:37:08.648 --> 03:37:09.649
ARE WHO WE WILL CONTINUE TO

03:37:09.716 --> 03:37:11.918
WORK WITH THEM. TO SEE WHAT WE

03:37:11.985 --> 03:37:14.020
CAN DO TO ULTIMATELY ADDRESS

03:37:14.087 --> 03:37:16.189
THOSE CONCERNS. AND FOR EXAMPLE

03:37:16.256 --> 03:37:17.791
THEY THE JUDGES DON'T MIND THE

03:37:17.858 --> 03:37:20.660
SIX MONTH REVIEW. BUT THEY WANT

03:37:20.727 --> 03:37:21.228
TO CREATE THE PRESUMPTION AT

03:37:21.294 --> 03:37:22.829
ONE YEAR. BUT THEN WHAT DOES

03:37:22.896 --> 03:37:24.297
THAT DO FOR THOSE KIDS THAT ARE

03:37:24.364 --> 03:37:26.767
THAT ARE. WOULD ONLY BE

03:37:26.833 --> 03:37:28.869
OTHERWISE BE SUBJECT TO THE SIX

03:37:28.935 --> 03:37:30.070
MONTHS BECAUSE IN THOSE

03:37:30.137 --> 03:37:30.771
COUNTIES THAT HAVE AN AVERAGE

03:37:30.837 --> 03:37:32.939
OF SIX MONTHS FOR THE CRIME THE

03:37:33.006 --> 03:37:34.141
THEY WOULD THEN BE EXTENDED TWO

03:37:34.207 --> 03:37:36.777
YEAR THAT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR SO.

03:37:36.843 --> 03:37:37.811
WE'RE TRYING TO SORT THROUGH

03:37:37.878 --> 03:37:39.479
THAT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

03:37:39.546 --> 03:37:40.847
TERMS OF THE BILL THE

03:37:40.914 --> 03:37:43.617
FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY WANT. AND

03:37:43.683 --> 03:37:44.618
THE ABILITY TO TAILOR

03:37:44.684 --> 03:37:47.020
CONDITIONS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES

03:37:47.087 --> 03:37:49.723
OF THAT CHILD IS REALLY WHAT

03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:57.597
THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT. SORRY I

03:37:57.664 --> 03:37:59.166
ALSO SEE HERE THAT THERE'S

03:37:59.232 --> 03:38:02.202
QUITE A BIT OF- ELIMINATION OF

03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:05.539
CERTAIN AREAS IN THE BILL THAT

03:38:05.605 --> 03:38:07.541
STATED SO THE PROBATIONARY

03:38:07.607 --> 03:38:09.109
PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS JUST ONE

03:38:09.176 --> 03:38:10.076
PORTION OF THE BUILDING YOU

03:38:10.143 --> 03:38:12.345
HAVE OTHER ITEMS HERE THAT YOU

03:38:12.412 --> 03:38:15.816
IS THAT WITH THE INTENT TO

03:38:15.882 --> 03:38:18.785
CREATE UNIFORMITY THROUGHOUT.

03:38:18.852 --> 03:38:22.522
HEY AND- AND THE OTHER QUESTION

03:38:22.589 --> 03:38:26.326
I NOTICED HERE WAS THAT- IN

03:38:26.393 --> 03:38:27.360
CONSIDERATION OF THE SIX

03:38:27.427 --> 03:38:30.564
MONTHS- THERE REALLY WASN'T

03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:35.535
MUCH AB HELPED. IT DOESN'T TAKE

03:38:35.602 --> 03:38:38.839
IN CONSIDERATION- THE TYPES OF

03:38:38.905 --> 03:38:43.510
CRIME- SO I'M READING HERE.

03:38:43.577 --> 03:38:44.578
BECAUSE THE BILL CONTAINS NO

03:38:44.644 --> 03:38:46.079
DISQUALIFYING CRIMES A MINOR

03:38:46.146 --> 03:38:47.347
PROBATION FOR MURDER SEXUAL

03:38:47.414 --> 03:38:49.516
ASSAULT VEHICLE VEHICULAR

03:38:49.583 --> 03:38:51.318
MANSLAUGHTER ARMED ROBBERY OR

03:38:51.384 --> 03:38:53.386
GANG SHOOTING BE TREATED THE

03:38:53.453 --> 03:38:55.222
SAME AS A MINOR ON PROBATION

03:38:55.288 --> 03:38:57.290
FOR PETTY THEFT OR VANDALISM.

03:38:57.357 --> 03:38:59.426
BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE. BECAUSE

03:38:59.493 --> 03:39:01.561
THE PRESUMPTION IS SIX MONTHS

03:39:01.628 --> 03:39:03.363
BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT

03:39:03.430 --> 03:39:04.898
PRECLUDES THAT FROM BEING

03:39:04.965 --> 03:39:06.700
EXTENDED BASED ON THE SEVERITY

03:39:06.766 --> 03:39:07.901
OF THE CRIME THE NEEDS OF THE

03:39:07.968 --> 03:39:10.103
CHILD. THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

03:39:10.170 --> 03:39:11.805
ARE THERE AND FOR A LOT OF

03:39:11.872 --> 03:39:12.539
THOSE CRIMES THOSE ARE GONNA BE

03:39:12.606 --> 03:39:15.709
CUSTODIAL CRIMES WE'RE TALKING-ABOUT NONCUSTODIAL WARSHIPS

03:39:15.775 --> 03:39:18.311
HERE SO THAT THEY ARE DIVERTED

03:39:18.378 --> 03:39:19.679
THERE THERE IN THE COMMUNITY

03:39:19.746 --> 03:39:21.348
BUT THEY'RE STILL SUBJECT TO

03:39:21.414 --> 03:39:24.251
PROBATION. AND IF THE NEEDS

03:39:24.317 --> 03:39:25.619
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT

03:39:25.685 --> 03:39:26.987
WEEK TWO OH TWO STANDARD

03:39:27.053 --> 03:39:27.954
BECAUSE THAT DOES TAKE INTO

03:39:28.021 --> 03:39:29.589
ACCOUNT PUBLIC SAFETY AND SOME

03:39:29.656 --> 03:39:30.924
OTHER THINGS RATHER THAN JUST

03:39:30.991 --> 03:39:32.759
WHAT'S WHAT THAT CHILD NEEDS AT

03:39:32.826 --> 03:39:35.929
THE TIME. SO THAT REVIEW COULD

03:39:35.996 --> 03:39:37.731
BE BUILT IN IN THE EXPECTATION

03:39:37.797 --> 03:39:39.699
IS THAT. THAT THAT SIX MONTHS

03:39:39.766 --> 03:39:41.601
IN THE PRODUCTION HERE REALLY

03:39:41.668 --> 03:39:43.537
FORCES A REVIEW OF THE CASE.

03:39:43.603 --> 03:39:44.604
PROGRESS THAT THE CHILD IS

03:39:44.671 --> 03:39:46.740
MAKING. THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES

03:39:46.806 --> 03:39:48.942
AROUND WHY THEY'RE THERE ALL

03:39:49.009 --> 03:39:49.442
THAT COULD BE TAKEN INTO

03:39:49.509 --> 03:39:52.045
ACCOUNT. AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT

03:39:52.112 --> 03:39:53.914
THE EXTENSION AND ESPECIALLY IS

03:39:53.980 --> 03:39:55.949
WE WORK THROUGH INCORPORATING

03:39:56.016 --> 03:39:58.818
WITH TWO OH TWO SO THE- THE

03:39:58.885 --> 03:40:00.220
NOTION THAT THAT EVERY KID IS

03:40:00.287 --> 03:40:02.622
ONLY GOING TO GET SIX MONTHS

03:40:02.689 --> 03:40:03.156
WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THE

03:40:03.223 --> 03:40:04.958
OPPOSITION TO SAY. IS JUST NOT

03:40:05.025 --> 03:40:07.460
TRUE. WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE

03:40:07.527 --> 03:40:10.564
ESTABLISHING IS. A BASS LINE.

03:40:10.630 --> 03:40:13.333
AND THEN A REVIEW SO THAT WE'RE

03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:15.168
NOT HAVING. NOT ONLY THE

03:40:15.235 --> 03:40:18.538
DISPARATE. TIME ON NORTON NOT

03:40:18.605 --> 03:40:19.539
THESE NONCUSTODIAL MORE TIPS

03:40:19.606 --> 03:40:21.408
OF. YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS

03:40:21.474 --> 03:40:24.411
IN SOME CASES SIX MONTHS TO A

03:40:24.477 --> 03:40:26.146
YEAR IN OTHER CASES BUT A

03:40:26.212 --> 03:40:27.581
LITTLE BIT MORE CONSISTENCY BUT

03:40:27.647 --> 03:40:29.049
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS

03:40:29.115 --> 03:40:31.851
THAT THAT REVIEW IS FORCING THE

03:40:31.918 --> 03:40:33.453
COURTS TO LOOK AT THE PROGRESS

03:40:33.520 --> 03:40:35.922
OF THAT CHILD. AND LOOK AT WHAT

03:40:35.989 --> 03:40:38.291
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. THEY CAN

03:40:38.358 --> 03:40:42.395
EXTEND. SO IT IT IT'S NOT A CAP

03:40:42.462 --> 03:40:44.798
IT'S NOT A LIMIT. BUT IT IS A

03:40:44.864 --> 03:40:46.566
REVIEW AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

03:40:46.633 --> 03:40:48.602
WE CREATE THAT PRESUMPTION. SO

03:40:48.668 --> 03:40:50.403
THAT IT'S NOT A REVIEW IN NAME

03:40:50.470 --> 03:40:53.907
ONLY AND JUST CHECKING A BOX.

03:40:53.974 --> 03:40:54.474
BUT THERE'S A STANDARD THAT

03:40:54.541 --> 03:40:56.977
NEEDS TO BE MET. FOR CARRYING

03:40:57.043 --> 03:40:57.811
THE WATER SO THE MORE SERIOUS

03:40:57.877 --> 03:40:59.879
THE CRIME. THE LONGER THEY'RE

03:40:59.946 --> 03:41:01.414
GOING TO BE. POTENTIALLY ON

03:41:01.481 --> 03:41:06.353
PROBATION. I BELIEVE THAT

03:41:06.419 --> 03:41:08.955
CHILDREN- YOU KNOW DO DESERVE A

03:41:09.022 --> 03:41:10.757
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION SPECIALLY

03:41:10.824 --> 03:41:11.958
WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE

03:41:12.025 --> 03:41:12.859
DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN AND

03:41:12.926 --> 03:41:16.563
HOW- YOU KNOW HUGE RESPONSE TO-

03:41:16.630 --> 03:41:18.231
THEIR HORMONAL STATE- AND

03:41:18.298 --> 03:41:21.234
DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME- BUT

03:41:21.301 --> 03:41:22.736
I AM CONCERNED WITH SOME OF

03:41:22.802 --> 03:41:27.707
THE- THE OPPOSITION'S AND I AM.

03:41:27.774 --> 03:41:28.975
I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE WHERE

03:41:29.042 --> 03:41:30.176
YOU'RE COMING FROM AS FAR AS

03:41:30.243 --> 03:41:33.480
THE- THE REVALUATION- PERIOD

03:41:33.546 --> 03:41:35.448
AND TO REALLY CONSIDER- THEY

03:41:35.515 --> 03:41:37.917
SHOULD I THINK. HERE AT LEAST

03:41:37.984 --> 03:41:38.885
THE COURT SYSTEM ALREADY DOES

03:41:38.952 --> 03:41:40.854
THAT AB WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING

03:41:40.920 --> 03:41:43.957
AT- AT THE SENTENCING OF A

03:41:44.024 --> 03:41:45.525
SITUATION WE HEAR THE ARGUMENTS

03:41:45.592 --> 03:41:46.826
WITH SOME OF THE JUDGES MAYBE

03:41:46.893 --> 03:41:48.995
NOT EVERYONE BUT I THINK. THE

03:41:49.062 --> 03:41:52.399
ONES THAT- YOU KNOW. THAT I'VE

03:41:52.465 --> 03:41:56.536
UNDERSTAND. DO- BUT I DO LOOK

03:41:56.603 --> 03:41:58.905
FORWARD TO SEEING- THE FUTURE

03:41:58.972 --> 03:42:00.774
COLLABORATION YOU HAVE WITH THE

03:42:00.840 --> 03:42:02.509
OPPOSITION I'M NOT GOING TO

03:42:02.575 --> 03:42:03.510
SUPPORT THE BILL RIGHT NOW BUT

03:42:03.576 --> 03:42:05.545
I DO TRULY APPRECIATE THE

03:42:05.612 --> 03:42:07.247
EFFORT THAT YOU'RE DOING IN

03:42:07.313 --> 03:42:10.083

BE SUPPORTING THIS AND THAT'S

03:42:55.729 --> 03:42:58.665
FINE. BUT TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

03:42:58.732 --> 03:43:00.934
THE DISPARITIES COUNTY BY

03:43:01.000 --> 03:43:02.302
COUNTY IS WHAT'S REALLY DRIVING

03:43:02.368 --> 03:43:04.504
THIS AND AS WE TALK TO JUDGES

03:43:04.571 --> 03:43:05.839
WHO SAY OH I WOULD NEVER DO

03:43:05.905 --> 03:43:07.340

TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY THINK IS

03:43:29.696 --> 03:43:31.631
BEST BUT SOMETIMES THEY BECOME

03:43:31.698 --> 03:43:33.433
VERY PATERNALISTIC AND THAT'S

03:43:33.500 --> 03:43:35.268
WHY YOU'LL SEE FIFTY CONDITIONS

03:43:35.335 --> 03:43:37.070

ADMINISTERING THE COURT

03:46:09.455 --> 03:46:11.658
BECAUSE- IN PARTICULAR WHERE

THEIR WILL INTO COURT WHICH OF

03:46:33.713 --> 03:46:34.747
COURSE CREATES ALL SORTS OF

03:46:34.814 --> 03:46:36.482
PROBLEMS FOR ALL SORTS OF

03:46:36.549 --> 03:46:36.916
PEOPLE INCLUDING THE

03:46:36.983 --> 03:46:39.619
DEFENDANTS- SO THIS BILL WOULD

03:46:39.686 --> 03:46:41.254
FIX THIS ISSUE BY ALLOWING A

03:46:41.321 --> 03:46:43.122
PRELIM OR TRIAL TO PROCEED IN A

03:46:43.189 --> 03:46:44.857
DEFENDANT'S ABSENCE AT YOU BUT-

03:46:44.924 --> 03:46:46.359
ONLY UNDER CERTAIN NARROW

03:46:46.426 --> 03:46:50.530
CIRCUMSTANCES. THE DEFENDANT

03:46:50.596 --> 03:46:51.130
HAS TO BE IN CUSTODY ONE. THE

03:46:51.197 --> 03:46:52.031
COURT HAS TO MAKE FINDINGS ON

03:46:52.098 --> 03:46:53.333
THE RECORD INCLUDING THERE'S

03:46:53.399 --> 03:46:54.600
CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE

03:46:54.667 --> 03:46:55.601
THAT THE DEFENDANT IS

03:46:55.668 --> 03:46:57.704
VOLUNTARILY CHOOSING. TO NOT

03:46:57.770 --> 03:46:59.639

THIS IS KEY MUST HAVE

INFORMED OF THEIR RIGHTS BY

03:47:14.020 --> 03:47:17.223
COUNSEL AND THE COURT- I THINK

03:47:17.290 --> 03:47:18.658
THAT STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE WE

03:47:18.725 --> 03:47:20.360
TOOK AMENDMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC

03:47:20.426 --> 03:47:23.029

03:47:24.797 --> 03:47:27.000
THE BILL CONSIDERABLY I THINK

03:47:27.066 --> 03:47:28.768
IT IT MAY BE WORTH OF COURSE

03:47:28.835 --> 03:47:30.136
NOT BINDING TO THIS COMMITTEE

03:47:30.203 --> 03:47:32.905
BUT IT DID PASSED THE ASSEMBLY

03:47:32.972 --> 03:47:33.473
SEVENTY EIGHT TO ZERO ON THE

03:47:33.539 --> 03:47:36.209
FLOOR- THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY

03:47:36.275 --> 03:47:39.512
THE CDA AND WITH ME I THINK

03:47:39.579 --> 03:47:41.347
