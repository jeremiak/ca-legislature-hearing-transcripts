DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING

00:34:57.895 --> 00:34:58.763
OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE

CURRENT CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC

00:35:08.673 --> 00:35:10.408

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:13.044
SOLUTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO CARE

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.846
FOR THOSE ALREADY IN SKILLED

00:35:14.912 --> 00:35:16.547

SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES.

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:32.396
LONG TERM STRATEGIES TO HELP

00:35:32.463 --> 00:35:34.799

THIS IS A- THIS IS A ANOTHER

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.523
HEARING IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.959
THAT WE'VE HAD ON THIS ISSUE

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:09.527
AND THE REASON THAT. THIS

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:12.597
COMMITTEE IS SO FOCUSED ON THE

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:16.167
ISSUE IS. WE'VE SEEN THAT. IN

00:37:16.233 --> 00:37:17.935
RELATION TO COPE WITH GAS TO OF

00:37:18.002 --> 00:37:21.072
THE MAJOR CAUSES OF COBIT

00:37:21.138 --> 00:37:23.307
DASHED AND INFECTIONS HAD BEEN

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:26.277
WITHIN- DIRECT PURVIEW OF THE

00:37:26.344 --> 00:37:29.113
STATE. ONE IS OUR CORRECTION

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.848
SYSTEM THOSE ARE VERY WELL

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:34.151
PUBLICIZED AS TO- VERY MUCH FOR

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:35.920
DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE THAT

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:37.488
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:39.123
INFECTIONS ACROSS OUR

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.592
CORRECTION SYSTEMS. AND ANOTHER

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:44.795
IS REALLY OVER THE REGULATION

00:37:44.862 --> 00:37:45.696
OF OUR SKILLED NURSING

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:47.531
FACILITIES WITH THE STATE LEVEL

00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:50.034
AND WALL THESE ARE MOSTLY

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:52.637
PRIVATE- ORGANIZATIONS AND

00:37:52.703 --> 00:37:54.872
PRIVATE COMPANIES. THE STATE

00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:56.207
HAS DIRECT PURVIEW OVER THE

00:37:56.273 --> 00:37:57.742
REGULATION OF THESE

00:37:57.808 --> 00:38:01.612
ORGANIZATIONS IN AS MUCH- WE

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.614
ARE ONE OF THE PRIMARY FUNDERS

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:05.750
BECAUSE MANY OF THE RESIDENTS

00:38:05.816 --> 00:38:07.485
OF THESE FACILITIES ARE EITHER

00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:09.420
A MEDIC CAL OR MEDICARE- THEY

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:10.921
ARE RECEIVING A PUBLIC

00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:13.824
SUBSIDIES. AND SO- WELL WE'RE

00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:17.128
NOT RUNNING THESE FACILITIES WE

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:18.796
ARE PAYING FOR THESE FACILITIES

00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:22.700
I THINK WHAT'S BEEN MOST-

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:25.336
DISCOURAGING IS. THE ATTITUDE

00:38:25.403 --> 00:38:28.439
OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:31.742
OF- THE PUBLIC INPUT AS WELL AS

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.678
LEGISLATIVE INPUT OR LACK

00:38:33.744 --> 00:38:37.048
THEREOF- I THINK IT IS. I THINK

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:38.349
IT IS GOOD THAT THE

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:39.483
ADMINISTRATION SEEMS TO BE

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.353
WORKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.055
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND

00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:45.189
WORKING WITH THE PROVIDERS

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:46.724
WHICH IS. I BELIEVE VERY

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:49.126
APPROPRIATE BUT WHAT HAS BEEN

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:52.530
MISSING IS THE VOICE OF THE

00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:55.700
CUSTOMERS YOU HEAR HOW FAMILY

00:38:55.766 --> 00:38:57.234
MEMBERS CAN'T GET ANSWERS

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:59.370
EITHER FROM THE FACILITIES OR

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:00.037
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AT

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:03.774
TIMES- AND IN TERMS OF

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:04.575
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALSI THINK

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:07.011
WE- HAVE PUT FORWARD A VARIETY

00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:10.147
OF PROPOSALS THAT. HAVEN'T BEEN

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:13.584
AGREED UPON OR WE HAVE TO

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:14.785
FIGURE OUT HOW TO. WORK

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:16.487
TOGETHER. AND I THINK THIS IS

00:39:16.554 --> 00:39:18.689
WHY- ARE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE

00:39:18.756 --> 00:39:20.825
SAID IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS WE

00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:21.392
HAVE ONE ON EDT AGAIN LATER

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:24.595
THIS WEEK. THE TERM URGE THE

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:27.198
VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS TO. SEEK A

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:30.034
MORE COOPERATIVE. STANCE WITH

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:32.269
THE LEGISLATURE PARTICULAR. AND

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:35.005
I THINK THE PUBLIC AS WELL. WE

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:37.241
KNOW THAT THIS- THIS CALL THE

00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:38.576
PANDEMIC IS EXTRAORDINARILY

00:39:38.642 --> 00:39:41.145
TOUGH- WE DON'T IMAGINE THAT

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:42.813
ANYBODY HAS ALL THE RIGHT

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.716
SOLUTIONS ARE THAT EVEN. THAT

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:46.317
WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING ALL THE

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:48.352
RIGHT DECISIONS- AT ANY

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:51.122
PARTICULAR TIME. BUT THE KEY IS

00:39:51.188 --> 00:39:52.790
TO BE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:55.025
TOGETHER. TO BE DOING THEM IN A

00:39:55.092 --> 00:39:57.294
COLLABORATIVE MANNER. TO BE

THAT ALL OF THE MINISTRATION

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:28.793

SOME OF THOSE PROTECTIONS THAT

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:41.438
WE WERE PROUD TO DO IN THE

00:40:41.505 --> 00:40:42.840
BUDGET WAS TO ENSURE THAT

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:46.644

ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- I

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:50.674
COMPLETELY CONCUR THAT- WE

ACTUALLY WE'RE WE'RE REQUESTING

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:54.311
TO BE A PROBLEM A PART OF A

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:56.447
PROCESS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO

00:41:56.513 --> 00:41:59.350
REALLY DIVE INTO THIS- SOME

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:01.085
PEOPLE MAY REMEMBER- THERE WAS

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:02.453
A LOT OF FRUSTRATION THAT ARE

00:42:02.519 --> 00:42:04.288
MAY REVISE HEARING WHEN WE

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:06.624
HEARD THAT MSSP AND SEA BASS

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:07.658
AND- WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:11.662
ELIMINATED- WITH NO BRIDGE WITH

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:14.999
NO AND THEN. A FEW DAYS LATER

00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:17.167
WITH THIS NEW PLAN ROLLED OUT

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:19.103
WHICH WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT.

00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:21.572
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF LACK OF

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:23.874
COMMUNICATION WITH US THAT WE

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:25.843
FINDING EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING

AND- WHILE IT YOU KNOW THERE

00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:30.047
ARE THINGS I THINK THIS NEW

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:32.483
BENEFIT COULD BE A REAL WIN FOR

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:34.818
EVERYONE- THERE ARE STILL LOTS

00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:16.913
THERE THE ABILITY TO CREATE A-

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.015
PER DIEM RATE FOR LONG TERM

00:55:19.082 --> 00:55:22.052
CARE TOLL EXISTS WITHIN THAT.

00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:25.922
THE FACT THAT COST FRAMEWORK.

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:26.690
THE THIRD QUESTION WE'VE BEEN

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:28.992
ASKED TO ADDRESS IS THE FACT

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:31.795
THAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD HAVE ON

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:46.576
DIRECT EFFECT IN. THOSE CASES-

TIMING IS EVERYTHING I SUPPOSE

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:58.054
AND THE FACT THAT THE PROPOSAL

00:55:58.121 --> 00:55:59.956
EMERGED WHEN IT DID. I THINK

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:01.491
HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED IN PEOPLE'S

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:03.626
MINDS WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:04.627
THAT IS NOT THE

00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:08.698
ADMINISTRATION'S ATTENTION WELL.

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:10.633
AGAIN IT'S INTENDED AS A NEW

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.402
OPTION THAT NONE OF THOSE CAN

ANTICIPATE WE WILL SEE AS WE

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:23.413
IMPLEMENT LONG TERM CARE TO ALL

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.148
SHIPPING FEES. IS THAT A NUMBER

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:31.287
pMAY ACTUALLY BE PROVIDERS IN

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:32.188
THE LONG TERM CARE BENEFIT

00:56:32.255 --> 00:56:34.190
STRUCTURE I MEAN IF YOU THINK I

00:56:34.257 --> 00:56:35.024
MEAN CERTAINLY I OBSESS

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:37.026

00:56:59.015 --> 00:57:01.017
THINK IT'S TRUE OF SEA BASS ON

00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:02.752
BUT THEY ARE VERY LIKELY TO BE

00:57:02.819 --> 00:57:04.587
PROVIDERS IN IT FOR CARE

00:57:04.654 --> 00:57:09.292

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:14.297
HAVE TO BE DOING A SLIGHTLY

00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:16.666
DIFFERENT LINE OF BUSINESS THAN

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:42.010
IT'S NOT INTENDED AS A

01:14:42.077 --> 01:14:45.547
REPLACEMENT- IT AND IT WOULDN'T

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:46.782
DO THE SAME THINGS THAT THOSE

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:50.285
PROGRAMS ARE DOING- THE SORT OF

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:53.255
KNOWLEDGE ON TIMELINESS PERHAPS

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:56.992
ITS EMERGENCE BUT- I WOULD

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:58.393
REALLY LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT

01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:59.695
THIS IS NOT INTENDED AS A

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:02.397
REPLACEMENT FOR. THE EXISTING

01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:04.099
HOME COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:07.669
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT- YOU'RE

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:08.971
STILL CONSIDERING WHETHER OR

01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:10.706
NOT TO INCLUDE THE DUAL

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:12.774
ELIGIBLES IN THIS WITH TWO

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:14.142
THIRDS OF MEDICAL RESEARCH

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:16.245
SENIORS THE RECIPIENTS BEING

01:15:16.311 --> 01:15:18.647
DUAL ELIGIBLES WHERE ARE YOU IN

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:21.283
THAT PROCESS. I THINK THAT THAT

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:22.484
DECISION HAS BEEN TAKEN THAT WE

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:23.785

AND VERSION TWO. ALL IT WILL BE

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:33.862
UNAMBIGUOUS AND VERSION THREE

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:35.197

OF THE THINGS WE WOULD TRY TO

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:06.167

EVERY CERTAIN NUMBER OF WEEKS

01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:24.419
AGO I THINK IT WAS EVERY OTHER

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:26.888
WEEK. OR MAYBE IT WAS EVEN

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:32.026

WERE TALKING ABOUT. FOCUSING ON

01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:37.292
NUMBERS AND REDUCING THE

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:38.927
INDIVIDUALS AND SNIFFS I JUST

01:26:38.993 --> 01:26:40.295

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:41.029
THING THAT WE WOULD DO AND

01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:43.798
SNIFFS WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY

ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HOW.

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:46.868
SNIFFS WERE CONTAMINATED IN THE

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:48.937
FIRST PLACE WE KNOW THAT IT WAS

01:26:49.003 --> 01:26:51.272
EMPLOYEES. AND SO WHY AVEN'T

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:52.874
WE BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE IN

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:55.410

WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. FOCUSING

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:08.082
ON NUMBERS AND REDUCING. THAT I

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:09.417

OKAY IF I CAN BY MAY I

01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:51.626
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN IS

01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:53.828
AROUND TIME THE FREQUENCY OF

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:55.530
TESTING THE PRIORITIZATION OF

01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:56.564
TESTING PARTICULARLY IN SKILLED

01:28:56.631 --> 01:29:01.102
NURSING HOMES- WE HAVE- SENSE-

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.404

SNIFFS TO THEIR BASELINE

01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:06.040
TESTING THEY SUBMITTED THEIR

01:29:06.107 --> 01:29:07.842
BASELINE TESTING SO ALL SNIFFS

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:11.079
DID- TEST ALL RESIDENTS AND

01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:11.612
STAFF INTO THEIR BASELINE

01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:14.782
TESTING. AND ALL OF THOSE WE

01:29:14.849 --> 01:29:17.418
HAD ABOUT TWO POINT 9% OF

01:29:17.485 --> 01:29:18.853
BASELINE TESTING OF THE HEALTH

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.555
CARE WORKERS WERE POSITIVE AND

01:29:20.621 --> 01:29:24.726
ABOUT 7% OF THE RESIDENTS WERE

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:26.127
POSITIVE BASED OFF OF THE

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:28.096
BASELINE TESTING. IT WAS A

01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:30.331
FACILITY THAT HAD A SINGLE

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:32.233
POSITIVE THEN THEY WENT INTO

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:33.935
WHAT'S CALLED RESPONSE TESTING

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:35.403
WHERE THEY DO RESPONSE TESTING

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:37.338
EVERY WEEK THEY TEST ALL OF

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:38.473
THEIR NEGATIVES IN ORDER TO BE

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:39.507
ABLE TO COPE PART BECAUSE OF

01:29:39.574 --> 01:29:40.842
COURSE THE KEY WHAT TESTING

01:29:40.908 --> 01:29:42.510
ISN'T THE ACTUAL TEST ITSELF

01:29:42.577 --> 01:29:44.178
SINCE THAT'S A POINT IN TIME.

01:29:44.245 --> 01:29:45.413
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.215
THAT TEST IS THAT YOU HAVE THE

01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:48.683
RESULTS AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:50.151
ACTION ON THEM AND TO BE ABLE

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:52.153
TO COHORT PROPERLY WITHIN A

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:55.323
FACILITY. UP THEN IF YOU WERE A

01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:58.025
FACILITY WHO HAD ZERO HOSTAS

01:29:58.092 --> 01:29:59.927
YOU HAD BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENCE

01:29:59.994 --> 01:30:01.362
AND YOUR STAFF YOU WENT INTO

01:30:01.429 --> 01:30:02.530
WHAT'S CALLED SURVEILLANCE

01:30:02.597 --> 01:30:06.434
TESTING WHERE WE TEST- 25% OF

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:09.036
THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS EVERY.

01:30:09.103 --> 01:30:11.672
WEEK AND SO YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:12.774
CONSTANTLY HAVING THAT CADENCE

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:15.176
OF- OF RESPONSE TENSING IRK

01:30:20.114 --> 01:30:22.216
OF OUR AND OUR EXPERT GUIDANCE

01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:23.518
FROM OUR INFECTION CONTROL

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:25.219
TEAMS ON WHAT WOULD BE THE

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:32.460
KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN- IN

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:34.562
THE PAST WHEN WE UPPED THAT

01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:36.330
AMOUNT OF TESTING IN THE TATE.

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:38.166
THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH HAVING

01:30:38.232 --> 01:30:40.168
ENOUGH- THREE ANTIGENS THERE IS

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:40.868
ENOUGH ISSUE WITH HAVING

TESTING KIT SUPPLIES AND- SWAPS

01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:49.477
AT SOME POINT WHICH. IS WHY WE

01:30:49.544 --> 01:30:50.411

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:24.212
GOING BEYOND JUST YOUR REGION

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:26.214
OR YOUR COUNTY. AND LOOKING AT

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.548
OTHER PRIVATE LABS OR OTHER

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:28.950
OPTIONS BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT

01:31:29.016 --> 01:31:30.384
THERE ARE SOME LABS. THAT

01:31:30.451 --> 01:31:31.853
REALLY WERE BEING UNDER

01:31:31.919 --> 01:31:33.287
UTILIZED AND HAD A LOT OF

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:35.389
CAPACITY STILL- BUT THEY MIGHT

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:37.024
BE IN A FARTHER DISTANCE SPACE

01:31:37.091 --> 01:31:38.860
WE'VE NOW ADDED. THANK YOU

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:39.994
SENATOR SO THAT THEY CAN BE

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:45.366
TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE AGAIN.

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:47.034
RIGHT NOW OUR SKILLED NURSING

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:48.836
FACILITIES DO THEY FALL DOES

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:50.638
THEIR TESTING FALL WITHIN THE

01:31:50.705 --> 01:31:54.542
SAME TRACK. OF EXPEDITED

01:31:54.609 --> 01:31:57.912
RESPONSE AS HOSPITALS DO. SO

01:31:57.979 --> 01:31:59.146
THEY ARE ASKED TO BE

01:31:59.213 --> 01:32:00.915
PRIORITIZED ARE HELL ARE

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:02.416
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:05.019
ASKED TO BE PRIORITIZED AND I

01:32:05.086 --> 01:32:06.654
DO KNOW THAT THE TESTING TASK

01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:09.457
FORCE DID RECENTLY RELEASE NEW-

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:11.592
PRIORITIZE ATION GUIDELINES.

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:12.994
AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY HAD

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:15.496
PLACED HOSPITAL- THEN SKILLED

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:17.632
NURSING FACILITY THAN OTHER

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:20.034
TYPES OF COMMUNITY AND WHETHER

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:21.535

01:32:21.602 --> 01:32:24.639
SPRATT- SO THERE IS NEW TESTING

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:26.774
GUIDANCE AND PRIVATIZATION BUT

01:32:26.841 --> 01:32:29.310
THEY ARE PRIORITIZED AND WE'RE

SKILLED NURSINGFACILITIES AND

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.286
I APOLOGIZE MISTER CHAIR I HOPE

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:41.956
YOU DON'T MIND ME- WHY WOULD.

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:45.026
THE TESTING AND SNIFFS NOT BE A

01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:48.362
PRIORITY RIGHT NOW. WHY IS IT.

01:32:48.429 --> 01:32:50.197
I WOULD ASSUME AGAIN GOING BACK

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:50.932
TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:52.566
HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT THE LEVEL

01:32:52.633 --> 01:32:55.369
OF URGENCY. AND WE'RE URGENTLY

01:32:55.436 --> 01:32:56.771
TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A WHOLE

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:59.040
NEW PROGRAM HERE BUT WHEN IT

01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:01.008
COMES TO ACTUALLY ADDRESSING

01:33:01.075 --> 01:33:03.077
WHAT'S KILLING PEOPLE. RIGHT

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:05.713
NOW THE TESTING IS STILL NOT

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.315
THE PRIORITY THAT IT SHOULD

01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:08.582
HAVE BEEN AND WE DISCUSSED

01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:09.583
ABOUT THIS JUST A COUPLE MONTHS

01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:12.987

I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT BUT I

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:22.363

TAKING SOMETHING BACK THIS IS

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:30.271
ABOUT THE LEADERSHIP THAT E

IT IF AT ANY POINT WAS

01:38:58.999 --> 01:39:02.770
ACCIDENTAL- BUT I GUESS EVEN

01:39:02.836 --> 01:39:06.473
AFTER THE POINT WAS MADE. THERE

01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:10.611

FORWARD TO ACTUALLY NOT JUST

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:15.082
CONSULT WITH THE LEGISLATURE

01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:16.317

01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:19.420
LEGISLATURE TO CRAFT A PROPOSAL

01:39:19.486 --> 01:39:24.725

01:42:56.069 --> 01:42:59.072
IT'S A PROPOSAL BUT IT'S NOT A-

01:42:59.139 --> 01:43:01.041

THAT IS SORT OF WHAT'S LACKING

01:43:27.834 --> 01:43:30.404

EXCEPT THAT THIS IS UNUSUAL AND

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:07.601
IT IS UNUSUAL BECAUSE FOR SOME

01:45:07.668 --> 01:45:09.036
PEOPLE BECAUSE THE LINKED IN

01:45:09.102 --> 01:45:12.139
OUR MINDS WITH OTHER PROGRAMS

01:45:12.205 --> 01:45:12.639

MEAN. LET'S NOTLUMP ALL THESE

01:45:17.244 --> 01:45:18.278

01:45:24.251 --> 01:45:25.118
TECHNICAL CHANGES THAT I

01:45:25.185 --> 01:45:25.952
UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A

01:45:26.019 --> 01:45:27.521
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. WHICH IS

01:45:27.587 --> 01:45:30.257
VERY GOOD AND WE THINK FOR THE

01:45:30.323 --> 01:45:31.425
MOST PART IT WORKS BUT THIS

01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:32.926
TYPE OF CHANGE IS A FAIRLY

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:35.195
LARGE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. AND I

01:45:35.262 --> 01:45:37.831
THINK EVEN AFTER THERE WAS

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:39.266
LEGISLATIVE CONCERN THAT WAS

01:45:39.332 --> 01:45:41.234
RAISED IN IN MY OPINION THIS IS

01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:42.936
JUST ONE ONE LEGISLATORS

01:45:43.003 --> 01:45:44.571
OPINION. THAT THAT CONCERN WAS

01:45:44.638 --> 01:45:48.775
IGNORED- AND WAS LARGELY

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:50.243
DISMISSED AND EVEN IN YOUR

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:52.145
OPENING REMARKS. IT WAS

01:45:52.212 --> 01:45:54.047
DISMISSED THE SENSE THAT YOU

01:45:54.114 --> 01:45:55.615
SAID THE WAY YOU WERE GOING TO

01:45:55.682 --> 01:45:59.553
INFORM THE LEGISLATURE WAS A

01:45:59.619 --> 01:46:01.154
LETTER. TO JAIL BC. IT AND

01:46:01.221 --> 01:46:04.691
AGAIN THAT IS NOT THE PROCESS

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:06.626
WHEN THERE WAS A MAJOR MAJOR

01:46:06.693 --> 01:46:09.529
CHANGE. USUALLY WHEN THERE IS A

01:46:09.596 --> 01:46:11.198
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THE PROCESS

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:13.166
EITHER GOES THROUGH THE BUDGET

01:46:13.233 --> 01:46:15.902
PROCESS OR IT GOES THROUGH THE

01:46:15.969 --> 01:46:17.971
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THIS IS

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:20.941
NOT EXCUSE GIVE ME I'M NOT DONE.

01:46:21.007 --> 01:46:23.143
IT'S NOT DONE IN SECRET IT IS

01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:26.213
NOT DONE WITHOUT PUBLIC INPUT

01:46:26.279 --> 01:46:26.813
AND I THINK YOU WHAT YOU'RE

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:29.983
HEARING FROM. MYSELF AND THE

01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:31.518

CONCERN OF REALLY WHAT YOUR

01:46:34.988 --> 01:46:36.156
INTENTION IS AROUND THIS

01:47:24.404 --> 01:47:26.573

01:47:27.774 --> 01:47:29.910
PLACE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.

01:47:29.976 --> 01:47:33.680
THAT REALITY IF WHAT I

01:47:33.747 --> 01:47:35.982

01:47:36.049 --> 01:47:40.287
WORK. ON A POSSIBLE THAT AT

01:47:40.353 --> 01:47:44.658
SOME FUTURE POINT. THERE MAY BE

01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:47.160
IT MAY BE PROVED BASED ON WHAT

01:47:47.227 --> 01:47:49.229

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:51.598

PART OF THAT WORKING PROCESS

01:48:13.053 --> 01:48:13.787

01:48:13.854 --> 01:48:17.390
SOME. DISCUSSION BUT THEY HAVE

01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:17.924

A BROKEN RECORD BUT THAT IS

02:02:13.592 --> 02:02:16.162
WHY. THE IMPORTANCE OF DOING

02:02:16.228 --> 02:02:18.230
LONG TERM CARE HOME AS A

02:02:18.297 --> 02:02:20.566

BACK BEHIND US YOU KNOW IT

02:02:33.145 --> 02:02:34.480
THERE'S A POINT AT WHICH WHAT

02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:37.416
WE WHAT WE MUST HAVE IS A STATE

02:02:37.483 --> 02:02:40.186

WAIVER. PROGRAMS BECAUSE THOSE

02:02:45.357 --> 02:02:46.826

02:02:46.892 --> 02:02:48.027
CAPABLE THEY DO WHAT THEY DO

02:02:48.094 --> 02:02:50.596
BUT TO. BUILD A SORT OF A

02:02:50.663 --> 02:02:52.932
DEEPER BENCH BEHIND TOWARD IT

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:54.834
AND I AGREE THAT THE THAT WE

02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:56.702
NEED TO LOOK AT THAT PROGRAM.

02:02:56.769 --> 02:03:00.039

PROBABLY AT THIS POINT THE MOST

02:03:17.623 --> 02:03:19.825
RELIABLE EFFORT WE CAN DO IS

02:03:19.892 --> 02:03:23.062

THE STATE MEDICAID PLAN.

02:06:44.530 --> 02:06:46.265

TO PREDICT WHAT I CAN'T CONTROL

02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:58.076
ALL OF THE- LET ME REITERATE

02:16:58.143 --> 02:16:59.177
WHAT I WAS SAYING EARLIER IN

02:16:59.244 --> 02:17:03.148
THE PRESENTATION OF. THE LONG

02:17:03.214 --> 02:17:05.650

DOC BECOMES BECAUSE THERE.

02:17:39.484 --> 02:17:40.785
RELATED PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:17:40.852 --> 02:17:42.587
WITHIN THE SAME FUNDING STREAM.

02:17:42.654 --> 02:17:45.457
PEOPLE COPYING BOOKS SO-

02:17:45.523 --> 02:17:47.192
BENEFICIARY WOULD HAVE TO

02:17:47.259 --> 02:17:49.327
CHOOSE WHAT THEY- WANT TO BE IN

02:17:49.394 --> 02:17:51.863

LONG TERM CARE TAL. NOPE AS FAR

02:17:56.001 --> 02:17:57.936
AS IT THE IMPACT ON THE

SPEAK PROGRAMS. I DON'T SEE AN

02:18:03.341 --> 02:18:06.645
IMPACT OLDER THEN ALL STEP.

02:18:06.711 --> 02:18:08.046
DAUGHTER FOR SOME REASON THE

SOME CONSUMER CHOOSE NOT TO USE

02:18:10.582 --> 02:18:13.585
THEM ALL. VERSUS LONG TERM CARE

02:18:13.652 --> 02:18:16.121
TALK THAT MARCH QUESTION I

02:18:16.187 --> 02:18:18.523
DON'T KNOW WE CAN GET INTO WELL

02:18:18.590 --> 02:18:21.893
CERTAINLY FOR. THOSE PROGRAMS

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:24.596
AND PACE WHAT SORT OF THE

02:18:24.663 --> 02:18:27.232
BEGINNING I OULD BE SHOCKED IF

02:18:27.298 --> 02:18:29.634
WE DIDN'T SEE THOSE PROVIDERS

02:18:29.701 --> 02:18:32.037

BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD IT SHOULD

02:18:36.241 --> 02:18:38.109
ACTUALLY BE PART OF THE

02:18:38.176 --> 02:18:40.011

CARE HOME SO IN FACT ASSIST I.

02:18:43.081 --> 02:18:46.551
SEE THAT IT'S LIKELY TO BE AN

02:18:46.618 --> 02:18:50.255
EXPANSION OF THEIR- THERE MODEL

02:18:50.321 --> 02:18:51.856
HOME BUT IT WOULD BE AGAINST

02:18:51.923 --> 02:18:53.391
THEIR TRUCKS I MEAN WE'RE NOT.

02:18:53.458 --> 02:18:54.826
MAKING IT BUT IT IS NOT

02:18:54.893 --> 02:18:58.363
INTENDED TO REPLACE THEM IN ANY

ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE-

02:19:07.772 --> 02:19:10.275
LEGISLATIVE DíAS TODAY ON THE

02:19:10.341 --> 02:19:12.077
COMMITTEE SAID ONE LITTLE BIT

02:19:12.143 --> 02:19:14.846
ABOUT MY- DISTRICT WHEN I

02:19:14.913 --> 02:19:16.981
STARTED OUT IN THE FIELD IT WAS

02:19:17.048 --> 02:19:19.584
A LONG LONG TIME AGO IN THE

02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:20.985
EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES. IN

02:19:21.052 --> 02:19:22.387
SAN FRANCISCO WHEN I WORKED FOR

02:19:22.454 --> 02:19:24.289
CATHOLIC CHARITIES AND I WORKED

02:19:24.355 --> 02:19:26.157
IN IN THE AGING SIDE OF THE

02:19:26.224 --> 02:19:29.094
FIELD AND WE DID HOUSING FOR

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:30.195
THE ELDERLY YOU HAVE YOUR OTHER

02:19:30.261 --> 02:19:31.730
CATHOLIC NURSING HOMES FOR THE

02:19:31.796 --> 02:19:33.998
ELDERLY SYSTEMS OUT WHAT THERE

02:19:34.065 --> 02:19:35.667
NEVER WAS THAT WE HAD WE NEVER

02:19:35.734 --> 02:19:38.369
SUCCEEDED. IN FINDING OUT HOW

02:19:38.436 --> 02:19:40.705
TO HOLD PROGRAM THAT COULD

02:19:40.772 --> 02:19:42.407
REALLY KEEP PEOPLE WHO HAVE

02:19:42.474 --> 02:19:45.009
BEEN MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT

02:19:45.076 --> 02:19:46.077
MEDICAL. IN THEIR HOMES AND

02:19:46.144 --> 02:19:48.113
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED UNTIL I

02:19:48.179 --> 02:19:52.050
SAW. IN CHINATOWN OF DOCTOR G.

02:19:52.117 --> 02:19:55.320
O. CREATE. WHAT WAS THAT IT WAS

02:19:55.386 --> 02:19:58.089
STILL CALL UNLOCK WHICH REALLY

02:19:58.156 --> 02:19:59.591
WHAT'S THE FIRST OF THE PACE

02:19:59.657 --> 02:20:02.727
PROGRAMS AND IT WORKED. IT WAS

02:20:02.794 --> 02:20:05.396
AN ENORMOUS SUCCESS. AND SO

02:20:05.463 --> 02:20:07.499
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:09.234
FULFILLING GOSH WHAT A SIGNAL

02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:12.537
MOST FORTY FIVE PLUS YEARS OF

02:20:12.604 --> 02:20:15.440
WHAT I. WANTED TO SEE HAPPEN

02:20:15.507 --> 02:20:18.176
ALL. BUT AVAILABLE. IN THE

02:20:18.243 --> 02:20:19.477
MEDICAID PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO

02:20:19.544 --> 02:20:22.147
ARE YOU KNOW DEDICATED MEDICAL

02:20:22.213 --> 02:20:24.816
MEDICAID MEDICARE WORKS AS WELL

02:20:24.883 --> 02:20:28.353
ALL. THE WHOLE BENEFIT SO THE

02:20:28.419 --> 02:20:30.655
BLOCKS. IF I SEEM A LITTLE

02:20:30.722 --> 02:20:32.724
IMPASSIONED AND NOT WILLING TO

02:20:32.791 --> 02:20:35.460
STOP A SLOWDOWN. THERE'S A BOAT

02:20:35.527 --> 02:20:38.196
SO LET ME LET ME EXPRESS MY

02:20:38.263 --> 02:20:40.565
PASSION IN THIS ALSO. THE

02:20:40.632 --> 02:20:42.734
REASON THAT I ASK THAT IS THAT

02:20:42.801 --> 02:20:43.635
THERE WAS A PROPOSAL

02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:45.303
SPECIFICALLY TO ELIMINATE SEA

02:20:45.370 --> 02:20:48.740
BASS AND MSSP WITH A NO BRIDGE.

02:20:48.807 --> 02:20:51.976
YOU'RE SAYING THIS PROGRAM IS

02:20:52.043 --> 02:20:54.646
NOT. INTENDED TO ELIMINATE THEM

02:20:54.712 --> 02:20:57.081
SO IMAGINE OUR CONCERN WITH

02:20:57.148 --> 02:20:58.616
THIS AND THE FACT THAT WE

02:20:58.683 --> 02:20:59.284
AREN'T INCLUDED IN THIS

02:20:59.350 --> 02:21:03.021
PROCESS- AND ALL OF THESE

02:21:03.087 --> 02:21:04.823
PROPOSALS ARE ARE. BEING

02:21:04.889 --> 02:21:07.859
PROPOSED. AND THEY HAVE GREAT

02:21:07.926 --> 02:21:09.360
IMPACT ON THE VERY PEOPLE WE

02:21:09.427 --> 02:21:11.830
REPRESENT YEAH WE DON'T GET TO%

02:21:11.896 --> 02:21:14.766
GIVE OUR INPUT WE WOULD WE

02:21:14.833 --> 02:21:16.668
AREN'T CONSULTED WE AREN'T

02:21:16.734 --> 02:21:19.270
PARTNERED WITH- THIS IS A

THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN SO

02:24:16.381 --> 02:24:19.717

THOUGHT TO THAT- AND IN YOUR

02:24:54.886 --> 02:24:58.890
DISCUSSION AS PART. I PROJECT

02:24:58.956 --> 02:24:59.524

02:26:46.831 --> 02:26:48.799

OPTION ON THE TABLE. AND I

02:26:53.604 --> 02:26:55.139
THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE

02:26:55.206 --> 02:26:56.741
SURE IS THAT WE ARE DEALING

02:26:56.807 --> 02:26:58.843
WITH THE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE AT

02:26:58.910 --> 02:27:01.078

02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:17.128
THAT. THIS POLICY NEEDS TO SLOW

02:27:17.195 --> 02:27:19.397
DOWN AND IS BEING RUSHED AND

02:27:19.463 --> 02:27:20.965

02:27:23.067 --> 02:27:26.170
AND BECAUSE OF THAT I HAVE A I

02:27:26.237 --> 02:27:27.805
STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT WITH

02:27:27.872 --> 02:27:29.674
WANTING TO PROVIDE THE URGENCY

02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:32.443
THIS YEAR AT ALL. I BELIEVE

02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:35.246
THAT WE NEED THE PUBLIC PROCESS

02:27:35.313 --> 02:27:36.781
SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE WE ARE

02:27:36.847 --> 02:27:38.849

02:29:55.753 --> 02:29:58.689
WHEN I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT

02:29:58.756 --> 02:30:00.891
THE PROPOSAL THAT'S PUT BEFORE

02:30:00.958 --> 02:30:02.259
US IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

02:30:02.326 --> 02:30:04.862
CONSULT AND CONTINUE TO WASSAN

02:30:04.929 --> 02:30:06.630
AND DELIBERATE ON THROUGH THE

02:30:06.697 --> 02:30:09.033
NEXT YEAR I JUST AM TRYING TO

02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:11.035
ROAD MAP OUT A LITTLE BIT WHAT

02:30:11.102 --> 02:30:12.870
SOME OF THOSE NEXT STEPS ARE

02:30:12.937 --> 02:30:14.939
AND THEN THAT TEAM I HAVE THREE

02:30:15.005 --> 02:30:16.474
FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND THEN I

02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:18.676
MAY MOVE US FROM THE PAST. AND

02:30:18.743 --> 02:30:20.244
APPRECIATE THE STAMINA AND

02:30:20.311 --> 02:30:23.280
WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN US BUT IT

02:30:23.347 --> 02:30:25.249
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT A

02:30:25.316 --> 02:30:27.718
SOCIAL SERVICES LANDS WHAT

02:30:27.785 --> 02:30:29.553
PERSON CENTRED ACCOUNTABILITY

02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:31.322
AND OUTCOME MEASURES WILL BE

02:30:31.389 --> 02:30:33.758
USED TO SHOW THAT THIS BENEFIT

02:30:33.824 --> 02:30:37.995
IS HELPING AND NOT HURTING

02:30:38.062 --> 02:30:42.333
AFFECTED MEDICARE RECIPIENTS.

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:43.000
THE EVALUATION IS GOING TO

02:30:43.067 --> 02:30:46.937
OCCUR IN AT LEAST TWO OF THE-

02:30:47.004 --> 02:30:50.741
ON THAT FIRST IS ON. HEALTH

02:30:50.808 --> 02:30:52.743
ACUITY MEASUREMENTS ARE UP OR

02:30:52.810 --> 02:30:54.879
PEOPLE STAINED. WELL ARE

02:30:54.945 --> 02:30:55.679
BECAUSE THEY'RE HEALTH

02:30:55.746 --> 02:30:59.116
STABILIZED ARE THEY- NOT HAVING

02:30:59.183 --> 02:31:01.352
TO GO REPEATEDLY TO EMERGENCY

02:31:01.419 --> 02:31:04.021
CARE FROM HOME I MEAN WHAT THE

02:31:04.088 --> 02:31:06.157
GOAL IS TO HAVE STABLE

02:31:06.223 --> 02:31:08.659
HEALTHCARE THIS IS NOT THE SAME

02:31:08.726 --> 02:31:10.594
AS SAYING TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE

02:31:10.661 --> 02:31:11.896
IF SOMEBODY NEEDS TWENTY FOUR

02:31:11.962 --> 02:31:13.898
HOUR MEDICAL CARE THAT. THIS

02:31:13.964 --> 02:31:15.800
PROGRAM WILL WORK FOR THEM THAT

02:31:15.866 --> 02:31:17.868
NEED TO BE IN AN INSTITUTIONAL

02:31:17.935 --> 02:31:20.070
SETTING BUT ASSUMING THAT THEY

02:31:20.137 --> 02:31:21.739
CAN BE MAINTAINED WITH LOOK

02:31:21.806 --> 02:31:23.808
LET'S YOU KNOW SORT OF A

02:31:23.874 --> 02:31:25.576
REASONABLE AMOUNT OF HOURLY

02:31:25.643 --> 02:31:29.346
CARE. ALL OF THAT WILL BE A LOT

02:31:29.413 --> 02:31:31.649
OF DAILY HERE ALL THAT THEN

02:31:31.715 --> 02:31:34.452
WILL. BE ONE SECOND MEASURES

02:31:34.518 --> 02:31:40.858
ALL ARE THE HAPPY. WITH SOME UP

02:31:40.925 --> 02:31:42.760
WITH THAT QUESTION WE PEOPLE ON

02:31:42.827 --> 02:31:45.963
IF THEY- CAME FROM THE NURSING.

02:31:46.030 --> 02:31:49.233
TOOK THE LONG TERM CARE. ARE

02:31:49.300 --> 02:31:51.469
THEY MORE SERVICE ARE LESS WITH

02:31:51.535 --> 02:31:52.903
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR

02:31:52.970 --> 02:31:56.407
DAVID. ON IF THEY CHECK IF THEY

02:31:56.474 --> 02:31:58.876
MOVED FROM ALL POSSIBLE

02:31:58.943 --> 02:32:03.080
DISCHARGE. TO OUR TOTAL IN

02:32:03.147 --> 02:32:04.949
THEIR HOMES OR THEY SATISFIED

02:32:05.015 --> 02:32:07.918
WITH ARTICULATE CONFIDENT THAT

02:32:07.985 --> 02:32:09.487
THEY ARE GETTING AND WILL GET

02:32:09.553 --> 02:32:12.823
THE CARE THEY NEED- DOT SO THAT

02:32:12.890 --> 02:32:14.058
IT'S GOING TO BE A CRITICAL

02:32:14.124 --> 02:32:15.626
PIECE TO IT AND FINE TUNE

02:32:15.693 --> 02:32:17.895
WITHIN THOSE TWO ON THE I

02:32:17.962 --> 02:32:19.563
REALLY LOOK TO THE YOU KNOW

02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:22.366
THE- HAPPINESS PART OF IT HOUSE

02:32:22.433 --> 02:32:23.968
TOOK OUR THAT'S WHERE THEIR

02:32:24.034 --> 02:32:25.903
SOCIAL CARE IS GOING TO COME

02:32:25.970 --> 02:32:29.306
INTO- ARE THEY FEELING THAT.

02:32:29.373 --> 02:32:30.174
THEY WERE IN CONTROL OF THEIR

02:32:30.241 --> 02:32:34.512
ENVIRONMENT. THEY'RE ALL. OKAY

02:32:34.578 --> 02:32:37.915
DAY LIVING IN. SO ABOUT THOSE

02:32:37.982 --> 02:32:39.283
LAWS OF THE PORT THOUGHT WERE I

02:32:39.350 --> 02:32:41.585
THINK WE- SOCIAL. AND MEDICAL

02:32:41.652 --> 02:32:45.356
CARE TO ONE PACKAGE. YOU KNOW

02:32:45.422 --> 02:32:47.024
I'M I'M REALLY INTERESTED BY

02:32:47.091 --> 02:32:48.759
ONE OF THE COMMENTS YOU HAD

02:32:48.826 --> 02:32:52.630
WHICH IS. IF YOU NEED US TO

02:32:52.696 --> 02:32:54.932
FOCUS ON THIS NEW OPTION AND

02:32:54.999 --> 02:32:58.302
NOT TO FIX ALL THE OTHER ISSUES

02:32:58.369 --> 02:33:00.871
WITHIN THE PROGRAMS. AND I

02:33:00.938 --> 02:33:03.307
BELIEVE WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT

02:33:03.374 --> 02:33:05.709
FIX FOR ME IS TO ACTUALLY SAY

02:33:05.776 --> 02:33:07.645
THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM ISN'T

02:33:07.711 --> 02:33:09.613
WORKING FOR ALL PEOPLE. AND

02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:11.849
WHERE I GO IS TO THINK BACK TO

02:33:11.916 --> 02:33:13.117
MY DAYS ON THE EMERGENCY

02:33:13.183 --> 02:33:14.184
DEPARTMENT WHERE IF YOU WERE

02:33:14.251 --> 02:33:16.453
JUST CHARGING SOMEONE YOU DON'T

02:33:16.520 --> 02:33:18.722
ALWAYS HAVE A STABLE. LACED TO

02:33:18.789 --> 02:33:20.357
GO WITH SYSTEM THAT WORKED

02:33:20.424 --> 02:33:21.959
WITHIN NOT ONLY JUST YOUR

02:33:22.026 --> 02:33:24.328
COUNTY BUT ACROSS COUNTY LINES

02:33:24.395 --> 02:33:27.898
WHICH IS. WHY I SEE THE LOGIC

02:33:27.965 --> 02:33:29.500
FOR BUILDING THE STATE WIDE

02:33:29.567 --> 02:33:32.369
CAPACITY. BUT I WANTED IF YOU

02:33:32.436 --> 02:33:34.872
COULD TO HAVE YOU EXPLAIN HOW

02:33:34.939 --> 02:33:36.807
THIS BENEFIT THE SHARES A

02:33:36.874 --> 02:33:38.676
PROPER AND COORDINATED.

02:33:38.742 --> 02:33:44.515
HOSPITAL DISCHARGE AND CASE

02:33:44.582 --> 02:33:46.216
IT'S INHERENT TO TOOK THE

02:33:46.283 --> 02:33:48.085
DESIGN OF IT I MEAN IF IT'S IF

02:33:48.152 --> 02:33:51.822
IT'S THE- INDIVIDUAL. PERSON

02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:53.057
THE PERSON WAS THE CENTER OF

02:33:53.123 --> 02:33:55.426
ALL THIS IF IT'S YOU KNOW THEIR

02:33:55.492 --> 02:33:57.861
DOCTOR IS CONCLUDING THAT

02:33:57.928 --> 02:33:59.897
EITHER THEY NEED TO GO TO

02:33:59.964 --> 02:34:04.668
SKILLED CARE OR ALTERNATIVELY

02:34:04.735 --> 02:34:05.869
HAVE LONG TERM CARE TOLD. AND

02:34:05.936 --> 02:34:09.206
THEN. IS MAKING THAT REFERRAL

02:34:09.273 --> 02:34:12.543
INTO. WHOEVER IS DOT LOCAL

02:34:12.610 --> 02:34:13.978
CONTRACTOR FOR THE LONG TERM

02:34:14.044 --> 02:34:16.547
CARE TO PROGRAM ALL WAS THEM

02:34:16.614 --> 02:34:18.616
DOING THE INDIVIDUAL WORKING

02:34:18.682 --> 02:34:20.017
WITH THE DOCTOR THE PHYSICIAN

02:34:20.084 --> 02:34:22.786
DURING THE INDIVIDUALIZED

02:34:22.853 --> 02:34:25.189
PERSON CENTERED CASE PLAN ALL

02:34:25.255 --> 02:34:26.624
AND THEN SORT OF SAYING WHAT

02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:28.626
ARE THESE RANGE OF NEEDS I'M IS

02:34:28.692 --> 02:34:30.294
THERE THE NEED FOR WOUND CARE

02:34:30.361 --> 02:34:33.197
IS THERE THE NEED FOR GI TO

02:34:33.263 --> 02:34:34.765
HAVE MAINTENANCE IS THERE THE

02:34:34.832 --> 02:34:36.967
NEED TO. GO DOWN THE LIST AND

02:34:37.034 --> 02:34:38.535
THEN COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE

02:34:38.602 --> 02:34:40.871
OF IT THE SOCIAL COMES ON TO

02:34:40.938 --> 02:34:43.240
SAY AND FOR THE PERSON DOES OR

02:34:43.307 --> 02:34:45.909
DOESN'T HAVE EIGHT AVAILABLE

02:34:45.976 --> 02:34:47.778
CARE GIVER IN THE WHOLE OF

02:34:47.845 --> 02:34:50.247
THEIR THAT CARE GIVERS CAPACITY

02:34:50.314 --> 02:34:53.350
IS WALKED OFF IF THEY ARE

02:34:53.417 --> 02:34:56.086
WORKING ON. SCHOOL DAY SHIFTS

02:34:56.153 --> 02:35:01.225
AND ARE NOT HOME DURING THE DAY.

02:35:01.291 --> 02:35:02.559
THAT IS THERE A DEVELOPER OF

02:35:02.626 --> 02:35:04.628
ALL OF THREE CARE GIVER.

02:35:04.695 --> 02:35:06.296
PRESENCE THE WHOLE AND THEN

02:35:06.363 --> 02:35:08.499
WHAT IS REALLY THE- OF THE HOME

02:35:08.565 --> 02:35:10.067
CARE GIVERS AND THEY HAVE TO BE

02:35:10.134 --> 02:35:11.735
BROUGHT INTO THE CONVERSATION

02:35:11.802 --> 02:35:12.536
TO THIS IS WHERE THE CARE GIVER

02:35:12.603 --> 02:35:14.772
RESOURCE ALL NETWORKS COME INTO

02:35:14.838 --> 02:35:19.677
PLAY ON. IT TOP CONVERSATION

02:35:19.743 --> 02:35:21.745
BUT PEOPLE MAY NOT BE TOTALLY

02:35:21.812 --> 02:35:23.580
UP FRONT ABOUT WHAT THE TENANT

02:35:23.647 --> 02:35:26.383
CARE ACT ASSIST ALL AND THAT

02:35:26.450 --> 02:35:27.818
HAS TO BE FACTORED INTO A CARE

02:35:27.885 --> 02:35:30.254
PLAN AND IF THEY CARED IF THERE

02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:31.355
IF WE CAN'T COME UP WITH AN

02:35:31.422 --> 02:35:32.690
ALTERNATIVE CARE GIVER PLAN

02:35:32.756 --> 02:35:34.491
THEN IT DOESN'T PROBABLY WORK

02:35:34.558 --> 02:35:36.760
FOR THE CLIENT BUT IF WE CAN

02:35:36.827 --> 02:35:38.295
EITHER THROUGH THE CARE GIVER

02:35:38.362 --> 02:35:40.497
WAS AT HOME WITH SUPPORT OR

02:35:40.564 --> 02:35:43.567
ALTERNATIVE CARE GIVER UP THAT

02:35:43.634 --> 02:35:45.269
MAYBE IT IS WORKING AND THEN.

02:35:45.335 --> 02:35:48.138
THE CCT PROGRAM THEY NEED TO

02:35:48.205 --> 02:35:50.207
COME IN TO DO QUALIFICATIONS TO

02:35:50.274 --> 02:35:52.509
MAKE MAKE THE PACKAGE WORK

02:35:52.576 --> 02:35:54.078
THAT'S THE WAY IN WHICH I THINK

02:35:54.144 --> 02:35:58.248
THE WHOLE COMES TOGETHER- BUT

02:35:58.315 --> 02:36:01.885
IT'S BECAUSE- ALL THOSE PIECES.

02:36:01.952 --> 02:36:05.122
KERN OPERATE. IN AN INTEGRATED

02:36:05.189 --> 02:36:06.690
FASHION AS OPPOSED TO THE

02:36:06.757 --> 02:36:08.358
PATCHWORK WHERE IF SOMEBODY

02:36:08.425 --> 02:36:09.760
LINKS UP WITH ONE PROGRAM

02:36:09.827 --> 02:36:11.095
VERSUS ANOTHER PROGRAM TO LOOK

02:36:11.161 --> 02:36:12.763
AT SOME OF THAT NEED MET BUT

02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:15.866
MAYBE NOT ALL. I'M AND I WILL

02:36:15.933 --> 02:36:18.235
COMMAND THE DEPARTMENT FOR

02:36:18.302 --> 02:36:19.536
LOOKING FOR FLEXIBILITY

02:36:19.603 --> 02:36:22.840
SPECIFICALLY THE ONE REGARDING

02:36:22.906 --> 02:36:24.842
GREATER THAN SIXTY DAYS STAYS

02:36:24.908 --> 02:36:27.044
WITHIN US WAS AN EASY ONE. FOR

02:36:27.111 --> 02:36:28.946
US TO HIGHLIGHT BUT I DO

02:36:29.012 --> 02:36:30.147
BELIEVE THERE WERE MULTIPLE

02:36:30.214 --> 02:36:32.249
THAT YOU WORKED IN JUST ONE ARE

02:36:32.316 --> 02:36:35.319
COMMENDED FOR THAT. NOW I WILL

TO HAVE A LANDS OF AN EQUITY

02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:48.165
LINE IS TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT

02:36:48.232 --> 02:36:51.602
IF. FOR WHAT POPULATIONS IN

02:36:51.668 --> 02:36:53.437
PARTICULAR WOULD THIS AFFECT

02:36:53.504 --> 02:36:55.405
AND WITH THIS MAGNIFY RACIAL

02:36:55.472 --> 02:36:58.008

IN THE PREPARATORY WORK ON

02:37:12.256 --> 02:37:15.192
RIGHT. OKAY AND THE DESIGN THAT

02:37:15.259 --> 02:37:19.163

COULD NOT BE PROVIDED IN OF

02:37:58.335 --> 02:38:01.104
ASSISTED LIVING SIDE. I THINK

02:41:48.932 --> 02:41:51.301
CONFUSING AND APPEARS TO ADD ON

02:41:51.368 --> 02:41:52.169
TO THE SIDE OF THE

02:41:52.235 --> 02:41:53.804
FRAGMENTATION OF THE CURRENT

02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:56.239

THIS RELATES TO MY SECOND

02:42:15.092 --> 02:42:16.460
CONCERN REGARDING

02:42:16.526 --> 02:42:18.762

FOCUSES ON WORKFORCE CAPACITY

02:42:40.083 --> 02:42:42.018

THE WORKFORCE TO DEAL WITH THIS

03:08:23.025 --> 03:08:24.559
IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES. I

03:08:24.626 --> 03:08:25.961
WANT TO FOCUS I WILL HAVE TWO

03:08:26.028 --> 03:08:27.329
QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL AND

03:08:27.396 --> 03:08:30.465

OF FOCUSED ON IT I USED TO.

03:08:42.944 --> 03:08:44.713
SURGICAL TERM EARLIER IT COULD

03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:46.548
HAVE BEEN A CARPENTRY TERM AS

03:08:46.615 --> 03:08:49.384
SOMEONE REMINDED ME. BUT I DO

03:08:49.451 --> 03:08:51.453
BELIEVE THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT

YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT. YOU CAN DO

03:08:53.789 --> 03:08:55.691

TIME. YOU CAN DO TWO OF THE

03:08:57.826 --> 03:08:59.728
THREE. AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

03:08:59.795 --> 03:09:01.596
HEARING FROM THEM MAJORITY OF

03:09:01.663 --> 03:09:05.000
US'S LET'S SLOW DOWN THE

03:09:05.067 --> 03:09:07.135
PROCESS SO WE CAN DO IT RIGHT.

03:09:07.202 --> 03:09:10.272
AND I BELIEVE AND WOULD LIKE TO

03:09:10.338 --> 03:09:12.741
HEAR FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS WHAT

03:09:12.808 --> 03:09:15.143

BURKE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES MA'AM.

03:09:26.888 --> 03:09:31.193
MMHM OKAY I DON'T- I MEAN I

03:09:31.259 --> 03:09:32.360
JUST THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

03:09:32.427 --> 03:09:33.962
PRELIMINARY WORK THAT HAS TO

03:09:34.029 --> 03:09:37.299
HAPPEN FIRST- YOU KNOW THERE

03:09:37.365 --> 03:09:39.434
HASN'T BEEN ANY THAT I'M AWARE

03:09:39.501 --> 03:09:41.069
OF PRELIMINARY WORK DONE TO

03:09:41.136 --> 03:09:42.938
IDENTIFY THE PATIENT POPULATION

03:09:43.004 --> 03:09:44.106
THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS

03:09:44.172 --> 03:09:46.308
BENEFIT NOR WHAT CRITERIA WILL

03:09:46.374 --> 03:09:47.709
BE USED TO DECIDE WHICH

03:09:47.776 --> 03:09:49.377
PATIENTS COULD BE SAFELY

03:09:49.444 --> 03:09:52.614
DISCHARGE. I HAVE TO SAY THAT

03:09:52.681 --> 03:09:54.816
I'VE HAD- FORTY SEVEN YEARS

03:09:54.883 --> 03:09:57.652
EXPERIENCE WITH SKILLED NURSING

03:09:57.719 --> 03:09:59.387
AND CERTAINLY CRAIG CORNET CAN

03:09:59.454 --> 03:10:03.792
ADDRESS THAT- IN A GREAT WAY

03:10:03.859 --> 03:10:08.029
BUT- I HAD TWO HIP REPLACEMENTS

03:10:08.096 --> 03:10:10.198
IF I HADN'T HAD TWENTY FOUR

03:10:10.265 --> 03:10:12.534
HOUR CARE AT HOME I WOULD HAVE

03:10:12.601 --> 03:10:13.702
HAD TO RUN INTO A SKILLED

03:10:13.769 --> 03:10:15.270
NURSING FACILITY AND I'VE

03:10:15.337 --> 03:10:17.139
VISITED BROWN TO APPLYING TO

03:10:17.205 --> 03:10:18.774
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:21.510
AFTER HIP REPLACEMENT BECAUSE

03:10:21.576 --> 03:10:22.344
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYBODY AT

03:10:22.410 --> 03:10:25.113
HOME TO PROVIDE THE CARE. AND

03:10:25.180 --> 03:10:27.149
THE WORK FORCE ISSUES ARE GOING

03:10:27.215 --> 03:10:29.951
TO BE HUGE HERE AND THERE ARE

03:10:30.018 --> 03:10:31.586
SO MANY THINGS I MEAN I LOVE

03:10:31.653 --> 03:10:33.655
THAT OUR LONG TERM SERVICES AND

03:10:33.722 --> 03:10:35.891
SUPPORT SHOP COMMITTEE HAS

03:10:35.957 --> 03:10:37.559
DEVELOPED IN THE CONCRETE

03:10:37.626 --> 03:10:42.364
RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR YOU AS IT

03:10:42.430 --> 03:10:44.032
RELATES TO WHAT WE COULD BEGIN

03:10:44.099 --> 03:10:48.203
DOING NOW AND I JUST THINK THAT

03:10:48.270 --> 03:10:48.804
THERE IS I THINK THERE LOT OF

03:10:48.870 --> 03:10:51.339
WAR OTHERWISE I MEAN I CAN

03:10:51.406 --> 03:10:53.542
ABOUT LIABILITY ISSUES I'M

03:10:53.608 --> 03:10:55.343
CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE

03:10:55.410 --> 03:10:57.579
HOME TOO QUICKLY WITHOUT THE

03:10:57.646 --> 03:11:01.149
SUPPORT THAT THEY NEEDED AND-

03:11:01.216 --> 03:11:03.652
AND DYING ESSENTIALLY I AM JUST

03:11:03.718 --> 03:11:05.153
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I

03:11:05.220 --> 03:11:06.922
JUST THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE WE

03:11:06.988 --> 03:11:08.456
REALLY HAVE TO TAKE TIME YOU

03:11:08.523 --> 03:11:09.758
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORK

03:11:09.825 --> 03:11:12.427
FORCE. AND THAT IS THAT IT

03:11:12.494 --> 03:11:14.229
THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE BOTH THE

03:11:14.296 --> 03:11:17.332
UNPAID CAREGIVERS ESPECIALLY AT

03:11:17.399 --> 03:11:18.667
IT AS WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS

03:11:18.733 --> 03:11:23.238
PANDEMIC AS WELL AS- AS WELL AS

03:11:23.305 --> 03:11:24.639
THOSE THAT ARE PAID CARE

03:11:24.706 --> 03:11:27.375
GIVERS- AND THERE'S A REAL

03:11:27.442 --> 03:11:29.411
SHORTAGE AND CERTAINLY IN RURAL

03:11:29.477 --> 03:11:32.647
AREAS WHERE I LIVE SO. I DO

03:11:32.714 --> 03:11:34.616
THINK WE HAVE TO GO SLOWLY I

03:11:34.683 --> 03:11:35.250
DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

03:11:35.317 --> 03:11:37.919
ANYTHING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER TO

03:11:37.986 --> 03:11:39.721
DO ESSENTIALLY THE WORK THE

03:11:39.788 --> 03:11:41.122
PRELIMINARY WORK HAS TO BE DONE

03:11:41.189 --> 03:11:44.259
NOW AND THEN MAYBE WE CAN HAVE

03:11:44.326 --> 03:11:46.828
SOMETHING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

03:11:46.895 --> 03:11:48.096
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BUT I BE

03:11:48.163 --> 03:11:50.699
TRYING TO RUSH IT WITH OUT THE

03:11:50.765 --> 03:11:54.002
LEGISLATURE BEING INVOLVED

03:11:54.069 --> 03:11:57.606
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY IS- IT IT

03:11:57.672 --> 03:12:04.613
IT JUST FELT. DISASTER

03:12:04.679 --> 03:12:06.348
COMMITTEE. I WOULD GUARANTEE

03:12:06.414 --> 03:12:08.550
WHAT WHAT CALIFORNIA. OF PUBLIC

03:12:08.617 --> 03:12:09.184
AUTHORITIES YOUR SPECIFIC

03:12:09.251 --> 03:12:11.453
QUESTION WAS WHAT IS OUR OUR-

03:12:11.519 --> 03:12:14.256
SO I TO ONE IS FOR THE- TO A-

03:12:14.322 --> 03:12:15.657
WHY. THIRTY FIRST WOULD BE

03:12:15.724 --> 03:12:18.693
THERE TIME LINE. THAT YOU

03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:20.862
COMPLETE THE DESIGN AND

03:12:20.929 --> 03:12:22.497
DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPOSAL AND

03:12:22.564 --> 03:12:24.299
WITH THE MEDICINE FIVE AND THE

03:12:24.366 --> 03:12:27.569
SECOND IS FOR THEM TO INCLUDE

03:12:27.636 --> 03:12:28.870
THEIR PROPOSAL AND THE

03:12:28.937 --> 03:12:31.239
GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. FOR

03:12:31.306 --> 03:12:32.774
IT YOU GO THROUGH THE REGULAR

03:12:32.841 --> 03:12:35.710
BUDGET PROCESS. AND THEN YOU

03:12:35.777 --> 03:12:37.379
LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE

03:12:37.445 --> 03:12:39.781
OUT YEARS THERE IS NO WAY THAT

03:12:39.848 --> 03:12:42.417
WE CAN DEVELOP A RESPONSIBLE

03:12:42.484 --> 03:12:47.756
STATEWIDE BENEFITS THAT. WOULD

03:12:47.822 --> 03:12:51.092
BE IMPLEMENTED NEXT YEAR. NOW I

03:12:51.159 --> 03:12:52.360
HEARD HOW DO I SUPPORT WHAT CAN

03:12:52.427 --> 03:12:55.130
JEFF BET AND THE PATTY BURKE

03:12:55.196 --> 03:12:57.432
CAN TOTAL SUPPORT THAT WE DON'T

03:12:57.499 --> 03:12:58.233
HAVE THAT WE HAVE THE

03:12:58.300 --> 03:13:00.335
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT

03:13:00.402 --> 03:13:03.705
THAT WAS OUR FIRST- OUR FIRST

03:13:03.772 --> 03:13:05.907
OBJECTIVE LOGIC AT THE EVERY

03:13:05.974 --> 03:13:08.643
STRUCTURE OF SERVICES IN PLACE

03:13:08.710 --> 03:13:09.144
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

03:13:09.210 --> 03:13:11.746
CALIFORNIA PRIOR TO DOING

03:13:11.813 --> 03:13:13.615
TRANSITION I MEAN THIS IS BIG

03:13:13.682 --> 03:13:17.385
FOR THE COLD IN THE CALL THAT

03:13:17.452 --> 03:13:18.320
CRISIS BUT- IN ADDITION

03:13:18.386 --> 03:13:18.987
HAPPENED LATE. IN THE GAME

03:13:19.054 --> 03:13:21.456
AFTER WE HAD. SERVICES IN PLACE

03:13:21.523 --> 03:13:23.024
AND THAT ALSO INCLUDES

03:13:23.091 --> 03:13:25.460
WORKFORCE. THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY

03:13:25.527 --> 03:13:28.897
IMPORTANT POINT- MISS BERGEN

03:13:28.964 --> 03:13:29.898
ONE THAT'S NOT LOST ON THIS

03:13:29.965 --> 03:13:32.467
COMMITTEE IS THAT DESPITE THE

03:13:32.534 --> 03:13:35.136
EFFORT. LED BY THE

03:13:35.203 --> 03:13:37.839
ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENTATION

03:13:37.906 --> 03:13:39.741
SENATE LAWRENCE AND THAT DOES

03:13:39.808 --> 03:13:42.944
NOT APPEAR TO SHOW CAPACITY

03:13:43.011 --> 03:13:43.712
WITHIN OUR CURRENT

03:13:43.778 --> 03:13:45.880
INFRASTRUCTURE I'M I HAVE

03:13:45.947 --> 03:13:47.148

FOURTH PANEL. AND DO BELIEVE WE

03:13:53.555 --> 03:13:54.723
ARE WORKING TOWARDS AS THE

03:13:54.789 --> 03:13:57.025
LEGISLATURE MAKING SURE THAT

03:13:57.092 --> 03:13:58.994
THIS IS PROPOSED IN THE JANUARY

03:13:59.060 --> 03:14:00.095
BUDGET AND THAT WE ACTUALLY

03:14:00.161 --> 03:14:02.664
HAVE LANGUAGE TO WORK OFF OF

03:14:02.731 --> 03:14:06.001
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO-

03:14:06.067 --> 03:14:07.602
PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND

03:14:07.669 --> 03:14:09.337
ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN WE DON'T

03:14:09.404 --> 03:14:10.438

WE CRAFTED THESE

03:18:51.052 --> 03:18:52.620
RECOMMENDATIONS THREE MAJOR

03:18:52.687 --> 03:18:55.189
CRITERIA IN MIND. FIRST WE

03:18:55.256 --> 03:18:56.624
WANTED TO MAKE USE OF OUR

03:18:56.691 --> 03:18:57.825
EXISTING HOME AND COMMUNITY

03:18:57.892 --> 03:18:59.127
BASED SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE

03:18:59.193 --> 03:19:01.229
WHICH IS ACTUALLY VERY BROAD.

03:19:01.296 --> 03:19:03.031
THANK YOU WE WANTED TO BE VERY

03:19:03.097 --> 03:19:04.899
PRACTICAL AND CONCRETE NURSING

03:19:04.966 --> 03:19:06.734
IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND TO

03:19:06.801 --> 03:19:08.136
CHOOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

03:19:08.202 --> 03:19:10.004
COULD BE QUICKLY IMPLEMENTED.

03:19:10.071 --> 03:19:11.906
AND THIRD HE WANTED TO HAVE

03:19:11.973 --> 03:19:13.374
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAD THE

03:19:13.441 --> 03:19:17.679
ABILITY TO BE TARGETED. TO

03:19:17.745 --> 03:19:18.379
COMMUNITIES WITH THE HIGHEST.

03:19:18.446 --> 03:19:19.180
AND WE KNEW THAT IT A LOT OF

03:19:19.247 --> 03:19:21.716
SENSE OF THAT MIGHT BE. THAT

03:19:21.783 --> 03:19:22.784
MIGHT BE COMMUNITIES BASED IN

03:19:22.850 --> 03:19:24.585
PARTICULAR HEALTH DISPARITIES

03:19:24.652 --> 03:19:25.620
AND WE THINK THESE

03:19:25.687 --> 03:19:26.821
RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE FLEXIBLE

03:19:26.888 --> 03:19:28.823
ENOUGH AND NIMBLE ENOUGH TO

03:19:28.890 --> 03:19:30.792
MEET THE NEEDS. AND WE KNOW

03:19:30.858 --> 03:19:32.393
THAT CONTAINING COVER NINETEEN

03:19:32.460 --> 03:19:34.395
SAVING LIVES IS A COMPLICATED.

03:19:34.462 --> 03:19:37.365
AND SERIOUS TASK AND WE KNOW IT

03:19:37.432 --> 03:19:38.132
REQUIRES A MULTIFACETED

03:19:38.199 --> 03:19:39.834
APPROACH BUT WE BELIEVE TE

03:19:39.901 --> 03:19:41.469
TRIAL RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE

03:19:41.536 --> 03:19:43.304
PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND A

03:19:43.371 --> 03:19:45.340
CARBON IMMEDIATE SOLUTION THAT

03:19:45.406 --> 03:19:47.041
YOU ARE NOW LOOKING FOR. SO I'M

03:19:47.108 --> 03:19:48.643
GOING TO QUICKLY WALK THROUGH

03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:50.378
ITS RECOMMENDATION. THEY ARE

03:19:50.445 --> 03:19:52.013
NOT LISTED IN PRIORITY ORDER

03:19:52.080 --> 03:19:53.247
AND WHAT WE BELIEVE THEY DO

03:19:53.314 --> 03:19:54.682
BUILD UPON AND STRENGTHEN EACH

03:19:54.749 --> 03:19:55.950
OTHER WE BELIEVE THAT DOING A

03:19:56.017 --> 03:19:57.618
FEW OR SEVERAL OF THEM. WOULD

03:19:57.685 --> 03:20:01.689
ALSO BE IMPORTANT. AND HELP

03:20:01.756 --> 03:20:02.557
PEOPLE AND SAVE LIVES. TO BE

03:20:02.623 --> 03:20:04.158
GROUP RECOMMEND. INTO THREE

03:20:04.225 --> 03:20:05.793
MAJOR CATEGORIES THE FIRST

03:20:05.860 --> 03:20:07.228
CATEGORY IS THE VERSION AND

03:20:07.295 --> 03:20:09.163
TRANSITION SERVICES. TO THE

03:20:09.230 --> 03:20:11.032
FIRST YOU HEARD REFERENCE TO BY

KAREN KIESLER WOULD BE TO

03:20:12.400 --> 03:20:13.634
CREATE A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

03:20:13.701 --> 03:20:15.870
TRANSITION PROGRAM. WE ALREADY

03:20:15.937 --> 03:20:18.139
HAVE THE FIFTY P. PROGRAM THAT

03:20:18.206 --> 03:20:20.108
IS EXCELLENT. SUCCESSFUL AND

03:20:20.174 --> 03:20:22.076
COST SAVING AND WHAT WE THINK

03:20:22.143 --> 03:20:23.111
WE CAN ADD TO THAT IT'S

03:20:23.177 --> 03:20:24.312
ALLOWING IT TO WORK FOR PEOPLE

03:20:24.379 --> 03:20:25.713
WHO HAVE LIVED IN NURSING HOMES

03:20:25.780 --> 03:20:27.482
FOR LESS THAN NINETY DAYS. SO

03:20:27.548 --> 03:20:28.916
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THREE

03:20:28.983 --> 03:20:32.320
MONTHS. BEFORE THEY CAN GET

03:20:32.387 --> 03:20:32.954
TRANSITION BACK HOME. CURRENTLY

03:20:33.020 --> 03:20:33.988
THERE IS ACTUALLY A VEHICLE TO

03:20:34.055 --> 03:20:36.090
DO THIS SB TWO FOURTEEN WHICH

03:20:36.157 --> 03:20:37.558

RECOMMENDING THE ESTABLISHMENT

03:20:43.531 --> 03:20:44.432
OF A COMMUNITY LIVING FUND

03:20:44.499 --> 03:20:45.800
WHICH WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO

03:20:45.867 --> 03:20:47.368
PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES TO

03:20:47.435 --> 03:20:49.270
PEOPLE CAN STAY IN THEIR HOMES.

03:20:49.337 --> 03:20:50.772
AND DO NOT NEED TO GO TO

03:20:50.838 --> 03:20:51.639
NURSING HOMES IN THE FIRST

03:20:51.706 --> 03:20:53.808
PLACE DEFINED COULD SERVE NON

03:20:53.875 --> 03:20:55.610
MEDICAL. AND NON MEDICAL

03:20:55.676 --> 03:20:58.713
ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS

03:20:58.780 --> 03:20:59.814
THOSE ON MEDI CAL. AND THE

03:20:59.881 --> 03:21:01.115
THIRD ARGUMENTATION IN THIS

03:21:01.182 --> 03:21:03.050
CATEGORY IS THE RAPID RESPONSE

03:21:03.117 --> 03:21:05.052
INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT. I'M

03:21:05.119 --> 03:21:07.422
NOT SURE EXACTLY THE SAME AS

03:21:07.488 --> 03:21:09.190
WHAT- DIRECTOR LIGHT DURING HAD

03:21:09.257 --> 03:21:10.691
PROPOSED BECAUSE I'VE JUST

03:21:10.758 --> 03:21:13.995
GOTTEN THAT EMAIL WITH THAT

03:21:14.061 --> 03:21:15.229
INFORMATION TODAY. DURING THE

03:21:15.296 --> 03:21:17.632
HEARING BY. OUR IS TO BASIC USE

03:21:17.698 --> 03:21:20.835
EXISTING PROGRAMS TO FILL A

03:21:20.902 --> 03:21:23.037
SPECIFIC ROLE IN H. BE A

03:21:23.104 --> 03:21:25.006
CONTINUOUS CARE BASICALLY WORK

03:21:25.072 --> 03:21:26.774
WITH HOSPITAL DISCHARGE PLANNER

03:21:26.841 --> 03:21:27.708
TO HELP MOVE PEOPLE FROM

03:21:27.775 --> 03:21:29.477
HOSPITAL TO HOME AND MAKE SURE

03:21:29.544 --> 03:21:30.878
THEY HAVE SERVICES IN THEIR

03:21:30.945 --> 03:21:32.880
HOME FROM DAY ONE AND DO NOT

03:21:32.947 --> 03:21:34.549
HAVE A GAP WHICH COULD CAUSE

03:21:34.615 --> 03:21:37.952
INJURY OR DEATH OR- CONTINUED

03:21:38.019 --> 03:21:39.353
ELEMENT. AND WE THINK THIS

03:21:39.420 --> 03:21:41.556
COULD BE TARGETED SPECIFICALLY

03:21:41.622 --> 03:21:42.890
IT SPECIFIC COMMUNITY SO WOULD

03:21:42.957 --> 03:21:44.559
NOT HAVE TO BE THE THING IT

03:21:44.625 --> 03:21:45.860
SHOULD BE A PROGRAM USED IN

03:21:45.927 --> 03:21:48.329
EACH COMMUNITY. NEXT WE HAVE A

03:21:48.396 --> 03:21:49.964
GOOD RECOMMENDATION AROUND

03:21:50.031 --> 03:21:51.432
ACCESS TO INCREASING ACCESS TO

03:21:51.499 --> 03:21:54.135
H. C. B. S. SERVICES. AND AGAIN

03:21:54.202 --> 03:21:55.102
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS

03:21:55.169 --> 03:21:56.337
VERY CLEAR WE ARE NOT SIMPLY

03:21:56.404 --> 03:21:58.039
SUGGESTING THAT JUST SIMPLY

03:21:58.105 --> 03:22:00.007
INCREASING WHAT. IS ENOUGH BUT

03:22:00.074 --> 03:22:01.843
WE INSTEAD THINK. THAT IF WE

03:22:01.909 --> 03:22:03.277
INCREASE FOUGHT AND LEVERAGE

03:22:03.344 --> 03:22:04.979
THE FLEXIBILITY AND MAKE THE

03:22:05.046 --> 03:22:06.180
ADMINISTRATION SIMPLER AND

03:22:06.247 --> 03:22:08.182
FASTER. AND THEN TO TARGET

03:22:08.249 --> 03:22:09.917
THESE EFFORTS SPECIFICALLY DID

03:22:09.984 --> 03:22:11.452
THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THEM

03:22:11.519 --> 03:22:13.488
WE CAN HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON

03:22:13.554 --> 03:22:17.091
SLOWING TRANSMISSION OF COBIT

03:22:17.158 --> 03:22:17.692

WAIVER SOUGHT BY TEN THOUSAND

03:22:22.163 --> 03:22:23.397
FOUGHT. AND INCREASING THE

03:22:23.464 --> 03:22:25.132
NUMBER OF COUNTIES. THAT ARE

03:22:25.199 --> 03:22:27.802

PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO MOVE-FARTHER. YOU GET THE CARE THEY

03:22:30.004 --> 03:22:31.305
NEED WE THINK THIS IS THE

03:22:31.372 --> 03:22:33.107
QUESTION SPECIALLY NEEDED FOR

03:22:33.174 --> 03:22:35.243
THOSE WHO CANNOT LIVE ALONE OR

03:22:35.309 --> 03:22:37.078
CANNOT LIVE IN A HOME. WITH ME

B. A WAIVER SPOT AND AGAIN WE

03:22:47.255 --> 03:22:49.123
CAN BE IN TARGET THE HOT SPOT

03:22:49.190 --> 03:22:50.358
AND THOSE PROVIDE VERY HIGH

03:22:50.424 --> 03:22:51.092
LEVEL SERVICES FOR PEOPLE

I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS HAS

03:28:06.974 --> 03:28:10.344

MARTHA'S HUSBAND HAS BEEN IN

THE FACILITY FOR A FEW YEARS IT

03:28:28.062 --> 03:28:30.164
WASN'T A GREAT FACILITY VPN

03:28:30.231 --> 03:28:31.498
LEFT. BUT IT WAS CLOSE TO HER

03:28:31.565 --> 03:28:33.534
HOME IT WAS CLOSE TO A PARK IT

03:28:33.601 --> 03:28:35.302
WAS CLOSE TO AT A MOVIE THEATER

03:28:35.369 --> 03:28:36.637
SHE CAN WIELD THEM TO IN HIS

03:28:36.704 --> 03:28:39.306
WHEELCHAIR. A CO THAT HIT AND

03:28:39.373 --> 03:28:41.141
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS SHE'S

03:28:41.208 --> 03:28:43.310
WATCHED FROM A WINDOW. AS HE'S

03:28:43.377 --> 03:28:44.778
LOST WEIGHT SHE DOESN'T KNOW

03:28:44.845 --> 03:28:46.380
EXACTLY HOW MANY POUNDS BUT SHE

03:28:46.447 --> 03:28:48.015
GUESSES OVER TWENTY BECAUSE

03:28:48.082 --> 03:28:49.850
SHE'S NOT IN THAT ROOM.

03:28:49.917 --> 03:28:50.951
PROMPTING HIM TO EAT

03:28:51.018 --> 03:28:52.419
ENCOURAGING HIM WITH TASTY

03:28:52.486 --> 03:28:56.423
TREATS AND JUST SPENDING TIME

03:28:56.490 --> 03:28:57.024
TALKING TO HIM AS HE EATS HIS

03:28:57.091 --> 03:28:58.225
MEAL. SHE HASN'T BEEN IN HIS

03:28:58.292 --> 03:29:00.527
ROOM MASSAGING HIS LEGS AND HIS

03:29:00.594 --> 03:29:01.929
HANDS THE THIRTY AND FORTY

03:29:01.996 --> 03:29:03.230
MINUTES SHE WOULD DO EVERY

03:29:03.297 --> 03:29:06.033
SINGLE DAY. AND INSTEAD SHE'S

03:29:06.100 --> 03:29:07.868
WATCHED OUTSIDE THE FACILITY.

03:29:07.935 --> 03:29:10.304
AS HIS UPPER BODY. THE SIDE

03:29:10.371 --> 03:29:11.772
THAT WAS DAMAGED FROM THE

03:29:11.839 --> 03:29:13.674
STROKE. IT'S AFTER FAILING TO

03:29:13.741 --> 03:29:16.143
THE POINT NOW WHERE SHE DOESN'T

03:29:16.210 --> 03:29:16.644
THINK HE'LL EVER BE IN A

03:29:16.710 --> 03:29:23.684
WHEELCHAIR AGAIN. WE KNOW THAT.

03:29:23.751 --> 03:29:25.152
THERE'S A RISK BRINGING

03:29:25.219 --> 03:29:28.088
VISITORS IN. BUT NOT ALLOWING

03:29:28.155 --> 03:29:29.623
THEM TO COME IN HASN'T IMPROVED

03:29:29.690 --> 03:29:32.660
OF THE RISK AT ALL WHAT WE KNOW

03:29:32.726 --> 03:29:34.228
IN JUNE WHEN I HAD THE

03:29:34.295 --> 03:29:35.562

03:36:22.636 --> 03:36:24.571
MONTHS. I'M MORE GLAD TO KNOW

03:36:24.638 --> 03:36:25.839
THAT THE STATE OF NEW PORT ON

03:36:25.906 --> 03:36:27.407
THAT. BUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY

03:36:27.474 --> 03:36:29.609
ESSENTIAL. NUMBER THREE

03:36:29.676 --> 03:36:31.578
INCREASING ACCESS TO AN

03:36:38.018 --> 03:36:44.191
IMMEDIATE AND EFFECTIVE MEANS.

TESTING THAT PROVIDES TIMELY

03:36:56.069 --> 03:36:57.904
RESULT. TESTING IS GETTING

03:36:57.971 --> 03:37:00.073
BETTER BUT THERE ARE STILL MANY

03:37:00.140 --> 03:37:01.541
HURDLES THAT WOULD THAT REMAIN.

03:37:01.608 --> 03:37:03.844

03:40:43.697 --> 03:40:47.467
LOT OF ISSUES EARLY ON WITH-

03:40:47.534 --> 03:40:49.436

IT'S JUMPING FROM FACILITY TO

03:41:00.113 --> 03:41:02.916
FACILITY BECAUSE- STAFF FOR

CONVERSATION OF. THE ECONOMY

03:41:08.688 --> 03:41:10.991

DISCUSSION OF HOW WELL WE ARE-

03:41:15.362 --> 03:41:17.330
PAIN IN TAKING CARE OF THESE

03:41:17.397 --> 03:41:18.164
PEOPLE WHO TAKE CARE OF OUR

WINDOW VISIT WITH A TINTED

03:41:40.153 --> 03:41:45.458
WINDOWS. ANOTHER REALLY GOOD

03:41:45.525 --> 03:41:47.193
POINT I THINK THAT WAS MADE

03:41:47.260 --> 03:41:50.497
MISTER CHAIR. WAS BY MISS

03:41:50.563 --> 03:41:55.101
COLEMAN ON THE SELF REPORTING I

03:41:55.168 --> 03:41:57.437
THINK THAT'S A BIG ISSUE-

03:41:57.504 --> 03:41:58.571
REALLY QUESTION FOR ALL THE

03:41:58.638 --> 03:42:00.206
PALACE THAT I WOULD HAVE IS

03:42:00.273 --> 03:42:03.543

03:42:03.610 --> 03:42:07.447
GIVING THE COUNTIES. A LITTLE

03:42:07.514 --> 03:42:11.317
MORE TEETH IN REGARDS TO.

OVERSIGHT AND THE ABILITY TO

03:42:13.620 --> 03:42:16.956
SHUT DOWN FACILITIES THAT- OR

03:42:17.023 --> 03:42:19.526
BAD ACTORS BECAUSE I KNOW SOME

03:42:19.592 --> 03:42:21.494
OF THE FACILITIES THAT WE HAD

03:42:21.561 --> 03:42:23.730
HAD VERY VERY POOR REPORTS THE

03:42:23.797 --> 03:42:25.665
STATE IT HAD GOING IN MULTIPLE

03:42:25.732 --> 03:42:31.037
TIMES. TO PROVIDE RETRAINING TO

03:42:31.104 --> 03:42:32.639
ADJUST FIRE ON SOME OF THESE

03:42:32.706 --> 03:42:35.275
NURSING HOMES AND- WE'RE

03:42:35.341 --> 03:42:35.875
ACTUALLY INVESTIGATING ONE OF

03:42:35.942 --> 03:42:40.847
THEM. SO YOU KNOW IF THE COUNTY

03:42:40.914 --> 03:42:43.416
HAD THAT ABILITY TO GO IN AND

03:42:43.483 --> 03:42:45.952
SHUT THEM DOWN OR TO GO IN AND

03:42:46.019 --> 03:42:49.689
TAKE CONTROL- OF ON THE IN ANY

03:42:49.756 --> 03:42:51.224
OF YOUR OPINIONS DO YOU THINK

03:42:51.291 --> 03:42:54.861
THAT THAT WOULD HELP. FOR THOSE

03:42:54.928 --> 03:42:56.596
SELECT FEW FACILITIES THAT ARE

03:42:56.663 --> 03:42:58.164
THE BAD APPLES THAT OR THE BAD

03:42:58.231 --> 03:43:02.769
PLAYERS- THEY AND I COMPLETELY

03:43:02.836 --> 03:43:05.538
AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS MADE-

03:43:05.605 --> 03:43:06.973
WE'VE ALL DONE A LOT OF WORK TO

03:43:07.040 --> 03:43:09.309
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TESTING

03:43:09.375 --> 03:43:11.010
AND TESTING SITES WE'VE HAD.

03:43:11.077 --> 03:43:12.679
COMPANIES LIKE CVS EVEN STEP

03:43:12.746 --> 03:43:14.481
UP. TO DO DRIVE THROUGH

03:43:14.547 --> 03:43:16.649
TESTING. BUT IT REALLY COMES

03:43:16.716 --> 03:43:19.085
DOWN TO THIS RESULT BACKLOG

03:43:19.152 --> 03:43:20.520
THAT WERE ALL SEEN IN THE FACT

03:43:20.587 --> 03:43:21.855
THAT IT'S TAKING TWO TO THREE

03:43:21.921 --> 03:43:25.725
WEEKS TO GET RESULTS. AND BY

03:43:25.792 --> 03:43:26.726
THE TIME YOU TAKE THETEST TO

03:43:26.793 --> 03:43:27.794
GET THE RESULTS YOU COULD'VE

03:43:27.861 --> 03:43:29.462
ALREADY GOT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

03:43:29.529 --> 03:43:32.232
SO BUT I SEE THE HUGE ISSUE

03:43:32.298 --> 03:43:34.768
THERE S- BUT AGAIN WITH THE

03:43:34.834 --> 03:43:37.103

ABILITY NOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND

03:43:56.756 --> 03:43:59.058

KIND OF A FOR THE COUNTY TO

03:45:39.359 --> 03:45:42.495
HAVE. ON IS THE PROBLEM THAT

03:45:42.562 --> 03:45:44.163
I'VE SEEN IS THAT BY THE TIME

THE STATE RESPONSE IS IT'S JUST

03:45:46.099 --> 03:45:49.035
TAKES TOO LONG. AND WITH THE

03:45:49.102 --> 03:45:50.703
COUNTY IS BEING RIGHT THERE ON

03:45:50.770 --> 03:45:53.840
THE GROUND- OBVIOUSLY THERE

03:45:53.907 --> 03:45:55.475
HAVE BETTER ACCESS AND A LOT OF

03:45:55.541 --> 03:45:56.242
THE PEOPLE THAT GET THE

03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:57.677
COMPLAINTS ARE ARE USUALLY THE

03:45:57.744 --> 03:46:00.380
LOCALS- AND BY THE TIME IT GETS

03:46:00.446 --> 03:46:02.548
TO THE STATE LEVEL- THERE'S

03:46:02.615 --> 03:46:04.484
ALREADY A SERIOUS ISSUE SO.

03:46:04.550 --> 03:46:06.619
FROM YOUR FROM YOUR VIEWPOINT

03:46:06.686 --> 03:46:11.257

03:46:11.324 --> 03:46:12.525
TO GIVE THE COUNTY BETTER

03:46:12.592 --> 03:46:14.294
OVERSIGHT TO GIVE THEM ACTUAL

03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:17.797
SOME TEETH- TO ENSURE THAT THE

03:46:17.864 --> 03:46:19.866
BAD ACTORS THAT. QUITE FRANKLY

03:46:19.933 --> 03:46:21.100
SIR MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION LOOK

03:46:21.167 --> 03:46:26.773
BAD- WHAT WOULD THAT BE. WHAT

WHAT OKAY SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:46:29.475 --> 03:46:31.177
THERE ARE IN SOME COUNTIES. THE

03:46:31.244 --> 03:46:32.612
COUNTIES WILL PUT IT MISSION

03:46:32.679 --> 03:46:34.480
BAND ON THE FACILITY IF THEY

03:46:34.547 --> 03:46:36.149
ARE CONCERNED AND THEY WILL SAY

03:46:36.215 --> 03:46:38.418
NO NO ADDITIONAL ADDITION UNTIL

03:46:38.484 --> 03:46:40.553
UNTIL- YOU KNOW WE SEE CERTAIN

03:46:40.620 --> 03:46:41.688
LEVELS OF IMPROVEMENT THAT

03:46:41.754 --> 03:46:43.056
HAPPENED. THAT HAPPENED

03:46:43.122 --> 03:46:44.290
DIRECTLY I WILL TELL YOU THE

03:46:44.357 --> 03:46:45.091
ONE THE THINGS THAT IS MOST

03:46:45.158 --> 03:46:47.560
CONCERNING US ABOUT. IT

03:46:47.627 --> 03:46:48.061
FREQUENTLY THE LACK OF

03:46:48.127 --> 03:46:50.630
COORDINATION. WE SEE A NORM AS

03:46:50.697 --> 03:46:52.131
I MENTIONED EARLIER THERE

03:46:52.198 --> 03:46:54.167
THERE'S DIFFERENT GUIDANCE IN

03:46:54.233 --> 03:46:55.368
COMBAT ALL OVER THE PLACE AND

03:46:55.435 --> 03:46:56.602
FISCALLY FREQUENTLY FIND IT

03:46:56.669 --> 03:46:58.338
VERY CONFUSING BECAUSE THEY MAY

03:46:58.404 --> 03:46:59.939
BE GETTING ONE SET OF GUIDANCE

03:47:00.006 --> 03:47:01.174
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:47:01.240 --> 03:47:02.442
DIFFERENT THAT TO THE STATE.

03:47:02.508 --> 03:47:03.910
AND A DIFFERENT THAT FROM FROM

03:47:03.977 --> 03:47:05.812
THE COUNTIES SO ONE CONCERNED

03:47:05.878 --> 03:47:07.714
WE'VE HAD FROM THE GET GO IF

03:47:07.780 --> 03:47:09.215
THE EQUIPMENT IS THE LACK OF

03:47:09.282 --> 03:47:11.417
COORDINATION AT THE DIFFERENT

03:47:11.484 --> 03:47:13.319
GOVERNMENTAL LEVELS BUT A LOOK.

03:47:13.386 --> 03:47:15.388
AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS THIS

03:47:15.455 --> 03:47:17.390
THIS IS LISA CALLING MAY I

03:47:17.457 --> 03:47:19.158
RESPOND TO THIS YES PLEASE.

03:47:19.225 --> 03:47:21.661
YEAH I WOULD ECHO PART OF WHAT

03:47:21.728 --> 03:47:23.129
A GREAT JUST SAID ABOUT THE

03:47:23.196 --> 03:47:24.897
INCONSISTENCY AND MESSAGING.

03:47:24.964 --> 03:47:26.933
AND THAT THAT INCONSISTENCY

03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:28.334
BETWEEN THE FEDERAL THE STATE

03:47:28.401 --> 03:47:30.903
AND THE LOCAL HAS CAUSED GREAT

03:47:30.970 --> 03:47:32.405
FRUSTRATION AND HARDSHIP AND

03:47:32.472 --> 03:47:40.013
CONFUSION AND IN SOME. CASES

03:47:40.079 --> 03:47:40.947
HAS MADE. HAS MADE THE CITY

03:47:41.014 --> 03:47:43.449
WORSE. WE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:47:43.516 --> 03:47:46.919
THIS IS BEING DOWN. THAT THAT'S

03:47:46.986 --> 03:47:49.489
THAT'S VERY EXTREME SITUATION

03:47:49.555 --> 03:47:50.423
AND WE WOULD HOPE IT WOULD

03:47:50.490 --> 03:47:53.760
NEVER GET TO THAT- MY ALL MY

03:47:53.826 --> 03:47:55.395
ALWAYS GO TO RESPONSES THAT WE

03:47:55.461 --> 03:47:56.329
NEEDED OMBUDSMAN'S IN THESE

03:47:56.396 --> 03:47:58.064
BUILDINGS AND THE FACT THAT WE

03:47:58.131 --> 03:48:02.702
HAVE SUCH DIVERSE. LOCAL PUBLIC

03:48:02.769 --> 03:48:03.503
HEALTH IS IN PART OF THE

03:48:03.569 --> 03:48:04.837
PROBLEM AS TO WHY WE HAVEN'T

03:48:04.904 --> 03:48:05.671
HAD ON BUT SINCE GOING BACK

03:48:05.738 --> 03:48:06.639
INTO THE BUILDINGS BECAUSE THEY

03:48:06.706 --> 03:48:08.207
SEE THESE THINGS WHEN IT'S

03:48:08.274 --> 03:48:11.077
SMALL. AND THEY ARE DOES I MEAN

03:48:11.144 --> 03:48:13.112
THE WHOLE FOCUS IS TO DO

03:48:13.179 --> 03:48:15.248
INTERVENTION BEFORE THESE

03:48:15.314 --> 03:48:18.284
BECOME BIG PROBLEMS. SO GETTING

03:48:18.351 --> 03:48:20.153
THE OMBUDSMAN'S BACK IN I DON'T

03:48:20.219 --> 03:48:22.321
KNOW THAT I WOULD SAY GIVING

03:48:22.388 --> 03:48:24.657
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH MORE TEETH

03:48:24.724 --> 03:48:26.526
I WOULD SAY A BETTER

03:48:26.592 --> 03:48:28.361
COMMUNICATION OF MESSAGE

03:48:28.428 --> 03:48:31.264
BETWEEN. THE AGENCY AND LOCAL

03:48:31.330 --> 03:48:33.733
PUBLIC OUT WOULD HELP A LOT. I

03:48:33.800 --> 03:48:35.802
I'M I WON'T FIND FAULT WITH

03:48:35.868 --> 03:48:37.737
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS

03:48:37.804 --> 03:48:39.305
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE SIZE OF

03:48:39.372 --> 03:48:40.973
THE POPULATION. WHEN YOU'RE

03:48:41.040 --> 03:48:42.775
LOOKING AT WHAT PERCENTAGE IS

03:48:42.842 --> 03:48:44.343
IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES

03:48:44.410 --> 03:48:45.711
IT'S PROBABLY LESS THAN 1% OF

03:48:45.778 --> 03:48:47.680
THEIR OVERALL POPULATION AND SO

03:48:47.747 --> 03:48:49.849
TO EXPECT THEM TO BE EXPERTS IN

03:48:49.916 --> 03:48:50.950
LONG TERM CARE IS PROBABLY AN

03:48:51.017 --> 03:48:53.286
UNREALISTIC EXPECTATION. BUT A

03:48:53.352 --> 03:48:54.987
GOOD SOLUTION I THINK WOULD BE

03:48:55.054 --> 03:48:56.989
TO HAVE A LONG TERM CARE EXPERT

03:48:57.056 --> 03:48:58.391
ON THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

03:48:58.458 --> 03:49:00.226
TEAM. AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD

03:49:00.293 --> 03:49:03.129
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. MORE

03:49:03.196 --> 03:49:05.731
ACCURATE INPUTS ARE ACCURATE

03:49:05.798 --> 03:49:08.568
UNDERSTANDING OF. OF AT. AN

03:49:08.634 --> 03:49:11.137
OUTBREAK THIS GOING ON IN A

03:49:11.204 --> 03:49:12.405
NURSING HOME. THANK YOU THAT

03:49:12.472 --> 03:49:13.840
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT IT'S

03:49:13.906 --> 03:49:15.441
I ASK THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WE

03:49:15.508 --> 03:49:23.916
HAD A. ONCE IT WAS REPORTED. A

03:49:23.983 --> 03:49:24.917
IN REALLY YOU YOU ALL KNOW HOW

03:49:24.984 --> 03:49:26.119
THESE THINGS IF YOU KNOW OF

03:49:26.185 --> 03:49:27.653
BLOWS UP AND IT'S A NEW STORY

03:49:27.720 --> 03:49:29.155
AND ALL OF SUDDEN IT'S LIKE

03:49:29.222 --> 03:49:31.624
WHAT HAPPENED HERE. WE FIND OUT

03:49:31.691 --> 03:49:34.327
THAT WE HAD A FACILITY THAT.

03:49:34.393 --> 03:49:36.762
HAD HORRIBLE GRADES FROM. THE

03:49:36.829 --> 03:49:38.698
APARTMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL.

03:49:38.764 --> 03:49:40.800
AND THEN YOU ASK THE COUNTY AND

03:49:40.867 --> 03:49:42.635
THEY TURN AROUND AGO WELL IT'S

03:49:42.702 --> 03:49:44.837
LICENSE THROUGH THE STATE. SO

03:49:44.904 --> 03:49:46.472
SOME WOMEN WE NEED YOU TO TAKE

03:49:46.539 --> 03:49:47.340
CARE OF IT BECAUSE IT'S AT THE

03:49:47.406 --> 03:49:49.475
STATE LEVEL. BECAUSE A LOT OF

03:49:49.542 --> 03:49:51.410
OUR OUR COUNTIES LIKE YOU SAID

03:49:51.477 --> 03:49:53.045
AREN'T USED TO DEALING WITH

03:49:53.112 --> 03:49:55.348
THESE POPULATIONS. AND THEY

03:49:55.414 --> 03:49:56.582
LOOK AT OKAY WHO HOLDS THE

03:49:56.649 --> 03:49:58.684
LICENSE BECAUSE WHOEVER HOLDS

03:49:58.751 --> 03:49:59.519
THE LICENSE HOLDING THE POWER

03:49:59.585 --> 03:50:01.787
OVER THEM. AND I WOULD AGREE

03:50:01.854 --> 03:50:03.623
HAVING MORE ODD BUT IT'S BEEN

03:50:03.689 --> 03:50:07.160
HAVING SOMEBODY THERE. WOULD

03:50:07.226 --> 03:50:11.931
DEFINITELY HELP WITH THESE IN I

03:50:11.998 --> 03:50:13.633
DON'T MEAN TO YOU KNOW GOING IN

03:50:13.699 --> 03:50:15.601
AND SHUT THEM DOWN BECAUSE WE

03:50:15.668 --> 03:50:17.837
WANT TO SEE THESE OPEN WE WANT

03:50:17.904 --> 03:50:18.604
TO SEE THEM BE GOOD PLAYERS WHO

WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

03:50:20.273 --> 03:50:21.774
KEEPING FACILITIES IN OUR

03:50:21.841 --> 03:50:23.743
COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY IN OUR-

03:50:23.809 --> 03:50:27.980

WE HAVE WAYS. WHERE THAT

03:50:35.888 --> 03:50:37.657
INFORMATION'S COMING OUT CENTER

03:50:37.723 --> 03:50:40.092
WHERE IT'S COMING OUT FASTER.

03:50:40.159 --> 03:50:43.262
AND WHERE YOU KNOW IF THERE IS

03:50:43.329 --> 03:50:44.130
SOMEBODY WITHIN THE COUNTY

03:50:44.197 --> 03:50:46.365
HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHERE WE CAN

03:50:46.432 --> 03:50:48.901
SET THE REGULATIONS WHERE EVERY

03:50:48.968 --> 03:50:51.003
COUNTY IS DOING IT THE SAME WAY

03:50:51.070 --> 03:50:52.939
AND HAS THAT SAME STANDARD OF

03:50:53.005 --> 03:50:56.075
CARE THEN THEY CAN ACTUALLY

03:50:56.142 --> 03:50:58.744

FORWARD BECAUSE IT THIS THE

03:51:08.054 --> 03:51:10.156
STOP. GAP BETWEEN. THAT

03:51:10.223 --> 03:51:12.191
FACILITY IN A RURAL AREA IN

03:51:12.258 --> 03:51:15.027
CALIFORNIA. GOING BACK TO THE

03:51:15.094 --> 03:51:17.296
STATEMENT COMING BACK DOWN.

03:51:17.363 --> 03:51:18.431

ARE DYING. BUT I DON'T EVER

03:51:21.100 --> 03:51:23.135
WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN

03:51:31.143 --> 03:51:32.178
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THESE PEOPLE

03:51:32.245 --> 03:51:34.213
ARE GETTING A RATING OF

03:51:34.280 --> 03:51:36.716
LITERALLY A ONE OUT OF FIVE. IN

03:51:36.782 --> 03:51:38.284
FRANKLY THAT THEY SUCK AT WHAT

03:51:38.351 --> 03:51:40.620
THEY WERE DOING. YET THEY WERE

03:51:40.686 --> 03:51:45.057
STILL OPEN. SO I JUST HAVE TO

03:51:45.124 --> 03:51:46.659
THINK OF HOW DO WE MAKE THE

03:51:46.726 --> 03:51:50.062
SYSTEM BETTER- YOU KNOW WITH

03:51:50.129 --> 03:51:51.330
THE LIKE YOU SAID PUTTING ON

03:51:51.397 --> 03:51:53.366
BUDGET WITHIN THEIR HAVING THAT

03:51:53.432 --> 03:51:55.067
PERSON AT THE COUNTY WOULD HELP

03:51:55.134 --> 03:51:59.305
BUT IT COMES INTO. SABALLY HAS

03:51:59.372 --> 03:52:00.339
AS WE SEE TOO OFTEN AS

03:52:00.406 --> 03:52:02.074
POLICYMAKERS UNLESS THERE'S A

03:52:02.141 --> 03:52:05.011
MECHANISM IN THERE. TO CREATE A

03:52:05.077 --> 03:52:07.313
AN ACTUAL PENALTY THAT WILL YOU

03:52:07.380 --> 03:52:09.181
KNOW GIVE THEM REASON TO

03:52:09.248 --> 03:52:12.752
ACTUALLY BE GOOD PLAYERS- SADLY

03:52:12.818 --> 03:52:13.919
THERE ARE SOME OUT THERE THAT

03:52:13.986 --> 03:52:15.288
WON'T DO IT UNLESS THERE IS A

03:52:15.354 --> 03:52:17.523
PUNISHMENT MECHANISM- HANGING

03:52:17.590 --> 03:52:20.092
OVER THEIR HEADS. BUT THERE BUT

03:52:20.159 --> 03:52:21.994
THERE IS WE DO HAVE THE-

03:52:22.061 --> 03:52:23.863
QUALITY ACCOUNTABILITY FUND

03:52:23.929 --> 03:52:26.232

TWO FACILITIES PROVIDING GOOD

03:52:35.875 --> 03:52:38.644
QUALITY CARE WHY DON'T WE DO A

03:52:38.711 --> 03:52:40.813
SERIOUS RE WORK OF THAT FUND

AND WE PROVIDE A BONUS TO

03:52:42.982 --> 03:52:44.116
FACILITIES THAT ARE DOING A

03:52:44.183 --> 03:52:46.819
GREAT JOB THEY DON'T FAIL AT

03:52:46.886 --> 03:52:48.554
THINGS LIKE HAND WASHING AND

03:52:48.621 --> 03:52:50.723

PURVIEW TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY

03:53:05.304 --> 03:53:06.739
OF CARE IT'S RECEIVED IN

03:53:06.806 --> 03:53:08.507
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BUT

03:53:08.574 --> 03:53:10.343
IT MEANS WE HAVE TO HOLD THESE

03:53:10.409 --> 03:53:12.178
FACILITIES ACCOUNTABLE AT THE

03:53:12.244 --> 03:53:15.981
LARGE CORPORATE OFFICE LEVEL. I

03:53:16.048 --> 03:53:17.283
DON'T WANNA SEE IS GOING IN AND

03:53:17.350 --> 03:53:20.052
BERATING A CNA I WANT TO SEE IS

03:53:20.119 --> 03:53:21.921
GOING INTO CORPORATE OFFICES

03:53:21.987 --> 03:53:23.022

GREATER DIVIDENDS TO THEIR

03:53:34.633 --> 03:53:38.404
SHAREHOLDERS IN A PANDEMIC THEN

03:53:38.471 --> 03:53:40.106
THEY WERE PROVIDED LAST YEAR.

03:53:40.172 --> 03:53:40.706

SLOW. AND YET WE'RE BEING- THE

ACCESS TO THESE FACILITIES IS

03:54:59.452 --> 03:55:02.021
BEING HAMPERED BY IN CONFLICT

03:55:02.087 --> 03:55:03.889
BY INCONSISTENCIESWITH LOCAL

03:55:03.956 --> 03:55:05.491
PUBLIC HOUSE SO THE LOCAL

OMBUDSMAN CAN'T GO IN IT

OMBUDSMAN HAS HAS. ESTABLISHED

03:55:11.697 --> 03:55:12.665

LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH TRACKS

03:55:14.567 --> 03:55:17.837
EVERYTHING. THAT'S THAT'S

03:55:17.903 --> 03:55:20.039
THAT'S TROUBLING OKAY I

03:55:20.105 --> 03:55:22.274
UNDERSTAND THAT- AND I WOULD

03:55:22.341 --> 03:55:24.043
JUST I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY

03:55:24.109 --> 03:55:25.978
YES I HAVE A I HAVE A RELATIVE

03:55:26.045 --> 03:55:27.780

FACILITY. I WILL TELL YOU FROM

03:55:29.782 --> 03:55:31.584
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THAT

03:55:31.650 --> 03:55:32.618
RELATIVE WHICH I SPOKE TO A

03:55:32.685 --> 03:55:36.355
LOT. LEADING UP TO- THEIR

03:55:36.422 --> 03:55:38.891
CHANGE OF RESIDENCE- THE

03:55:38.958 --> 03:55:39.892
TELEPHONE BUSINESS JUST DON'T

03:55:39.959 --> 03:55:42.495
CUT IT- QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE

03:55:42.561 --> 03:55:44.063
THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP THERE'S

03:55:44.129 --> 03:55:45.598
NO SUBSTITUTE FOR A FACE TO

03:55:45.664 --> 03:55:48.000
FACE- IN PERSON CONTACT AND I

03:55:48.067 --> 03:55:48.934
DON'T MEAN THROUGH A GLASS

03:55:49.001 --> 03:55:50.736
EITHER. THEIR SUBTLE BODY

03:55:50.803 --> 03:55:52.271
LANGUAGE CHANGES ARE ALL SORTS

03:55:52.338 --> 03:55:54.373
OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE

03:55:54.440 --> 03:55:56.809
YOU KNOW I WENT FOR A COUPLE OF

03:55:56.876 --> 03:55:58.344
YEARS NOT REALIZING THE GRAVITY

03:55:58.410 --> 03:55:59.478
OF THE SITUATION THAT MY

03:55:59.545 --> 03:56:01.413
RELATIVE WAS IN. BECAUSE THEY

03:56:01.480 --> 03:56:03.516
HAD CREATED COPING MECHANISMS

03:56:03.582 --> 03:56:06.619
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT MAKE ME

03:56:06.685 --> 03:56:08.521
FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING WAS OKAY

03:56:08.587 --> 03:56:10.956
WHEN IT TRULY WASN'T AND SO I

03:56:11.023 --> 03:56:12.258
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T

03:56:12.324 --> 03:56:13.792
WANT TO LEARN THEIR FAMILY. AND

03:56:13.859 --> 03:56:15.628
MAYBE SOME AND MAYBE NOT BE

03:56:15.694 --> 03:56:17.730
ABLE TO SPEAK UP BUT I DO WORRY

03:56:17.796 --> 03:56:19.231
THAT THIS YOU KNOW THAT THERE

03:56:19.298 --> 03:56:21.267
ARE BIGGER PROBLEMS THERE THAT

03:56:21.333 --> 03:56:23.269
WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T

03:56:23.335 --> 03:56:25.704
HAVE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND OR

03:56:25.771 --> 03:56:27.239
IN BOOTS IN THE BUILDING SO TO

03:56:27.306 --> 03:56:29.141
SPEAK. AND IT REALLY REALLY IS

03:56:29.208 --> 03:56:31.043
TROUBLING SO I GUESS I AM I AM

03:56:31.110 --> 03:56:32.111
YOU KNOW I I'M DISAPPOINTED

03:56:32.177 --> 03:56:35.047
BECAUSE WE TALKED WE TALKED

03:56:35.114 --> 03:56:36.282
ABOUT THIS ISSUE. IT WE HAD A

03:56:36.348 --> 03:56:37.182
AND R. I THINK WE'VE TALKED

03:56:37.249 --> 03:56:38.817
ABOUT THIS AT OUR LAST-

03:56:38.884 --> 03:56:40.352
OVERSIGHT HEARING WE DID ON

03:56:40.419 --> 03:56:41.253
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

03:56:41.320 --> 03:56:43.222
WHICH WAS. BACK IN JUNE I

03:56:43.289 --> 03:56:45.925
BELIEVE- AND- AND HERE WE ARE

03:56:45.991 --> 03:56:47.393
COUPLE MONTHS LATER AND YOU'RE

03:56:47.459 --> 03:56:48.961
TELLING ME THAT PROGRESS IS

03:56:49.028 --> 03:56:50.062
SLOW AND THAT'S REALLY

03:56:50.129 --> 03:56:52.665
FRUSTRATING IN MY HOME COUNTY.

03:56:52.731 --> 03:56:54.500
80% OF THE DEATHS FROM KOBE

03:56:54.567 --> 03:56:56.502
EIGHTY PERCENT. ARE IN SKILLED

03:56:56.569 --> 03:56:59.371
NURSING FACILITIES. AND I THINK

03:56:59.438 --> 03:57:02.074
THAT'S INCREDIBLY TROUBLING TO

03:57:02.141 --> 03:57:04.777
ME. AND I JUST. EIGHTY YOU GUYS

03:57:04.843 --> 03:57:06.779
DO SUCH AMAZING WORK AND IT'S I

03:57:06.845 --> 03:57:08.314
JUST. I'M REALLY REALLY

03:57:08.380 --> 03:57:10.616
FRUSTRATED THAT WEEK AS A AT

03:57:10.683 --> 03:57:11.850
THE STATE LEVEL CANNOT DO

03:57:11.917 --> 03:57:14.553
SOMETHING. TO COMPEL LOCAL

03:57:14.620 --> 03:57:15.387
PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES TO

03:57:15.454 --> 03:57:18.157
ALLOW. FOR YOUR PRESENCE IN

03:57:18.223 --> 03:57:21.093
THESE FACILITIES PERIOD AND SO.

03:57:21.160 --> 03:57:22.061
THAT I DO THINK WE'RE GETTING

03:57:22.127 --> 03:57:24.597
THERE AND AS LATE. EARLIER THAT

03:57:24.663 --> 03:57:28.300
TO ADD. THE DEPARTMENT IS-

03:57:28.367 --> 03:57:29.902
SEEMINGLY MUCH MORE WILLING TO

03:57:29.969 --> 03:57:32.271
BE PROACTIVE AND SPEAK ON OUR

03:57:32.338 --> 03:57:34.273
BEHALF LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH- OF

03:57:34.340 --> 03:57:36.041
BUT- THIS IS THE BUDGET

03:57:36.108 --> 03:57:37.576
COMMITTEE AND I WOULD BE

03:57:37.643 --> 03:57:39.211
SHIRKING MY RESPONSIBILITIES IF

03:57:39.278 --> 03:57:40.346
I DIDN'T POINT OUT THE FACT

03:57:40.412 --> 03:57:41.814
THAT SIXTY PERCENT. OF

03:57:41.880 --> 03:57:44.416
OMBUDSMEN CURRENTLY ARE OVER

03:57:44.483 --> 03:57:46.285
THE AGE OF SIXTY. SO WHILE THE

03:57:46.352 --> 03:57:49.555
MONEY THAT THIS THIS COMMITTEE.

03:57:49.622 --> 03:57:51.256
USED TO RESOURCE THE OMBUDSMAN

03:57:51.323 --> 03:57:52.791
PROGRAM OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS

03:57:52.858 --> 03:57:54.493
STARTED TO SHOW BENEFITS WE

03:57:54.560 --> 03:57:56.495
WERE UP HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS AT

03:57:56.562 --> 03:57:58.831
THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR- I

03:57:58.897 --> 03:58:01.000
CAN TELL YOU THAT THE

03:58:01.066 --> 03:58:02.401
DECERTIFICATION PROCESS IS

03:58:02.468 --> 03:58:05.437
HAPPENING IT'S SLOW BECAUSE

03:58:05.504 --> 03:58:06.038
RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO

03:58:06.105 --> 03:58:08.674
FACILITIES IN A IN. A LARGE WAY

03:58:08.741 --> 03:58:10.809
BUT IT IS GOING TO OCCUR AND

03:58:10.876 --> 03:58:12.077
IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THAT THE

03:58:12.144 --> 03:58:15.014
STATE SPEND MONEY TO HAVE STAFF

03:58:15.080 --> 03:58:15.948
BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE

03:58:16.015 --> 03:58:18.751
GOING INTO THESE FACILITIES AND

03:58:18.817 --> 03:58:21.520
IF. WE HAVE ONE PARTICULAR

03:58:21.587 --> 03:58:24.056
PROGRAM THE AVERAGE AGE OF

03:58:24.123 --> 03:58:25.791
STAFF IN THE FIFTH AT THE

03:58:25.858 --> 03:58:28.761
AVERAGE AGE FOR THAT STAFF FOR

03:58:28.827 --> 03:58:32.097
A PROGRAM. SAYING THIS BADLY.

03:58:32.164 --> 03:58:34.900
UP THERE EIGHTY YEARS OLD. WE

03:58:34.967 --> 03:58:36.135
HAVE IT WE HAVE AN OMBUDSMAN

03:58:36.201 --> 03:58:37.036
HE'S EIGHTY FOUR WITH ANOTHER

03:58:37.102 --> 03:58:39.004
OPPORTUNITY SEVENTY NINE YOU

03:58:39.071 --> 03:58:40.706
KNOW IT IT IT'SDONE THAT

03:58:40.773 --> 03:58:42.274
DOESN'T WORK THEY ARE GREAT

03:58:42.341 --> 03:58:43.809
ADVOCATES THEY ARE FEARS THEY

03:58:43.876 --> 03:58:45.344
KNOW THE RULES THEY THEY NEED

03:58:45.411 --> 03:58:47.546
NO AND HAVE FORGOTTEN MORE THAN

03:58:47.613 --> 03:58:49.348
I WILL EVER KNOW. BUT IT DOES

03:58:49.415 --> 03:58:50.516
NOT MAKE SENSE TO BRING THEM

03:58:50.582 --> 03:58:52.384
INTO A FACILITY SO WE ARE GOING

OF THE RESIDENTS TESTED

04:00:40.859 --> 04:00:41.760
GIRLFRIENDS IN THERE I DON'T

KNOW- BUT JUST. IT SO THE

04:00:45.364 --> 04:00:47.533
FACILITY ITSELF I WANT TO GIVE

04:00:47.599 --> 04:00:49.434
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE THEY

04:00:49.501 --> 04:00:51.270
DID A GREAT JOB IN TAKING CARE

04:00:51.336 --> 04:00:53.539
OF MY UNCLE BUT ONCE KOBE HAD

ENTERED THE FACILITY. THAT WAS

04:00:56.041 --> 04:00:58.644
THE END- BUT WE HAD LOTS OF THE

04:01:03.348 --> 04:01:04.449
NUMBER OF THEM TESTED POSITIVE

04:01:04.516 --> 04:01:07.653
FINDING WAYS TO. PROTECT

EVERYBODY AND THERE'S GOING TO

04:01:08.854 --> 04:01:10.989
BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. HERE I

04:01:11.056 --> 04:01:13.625
DO HAVE A QUESTION AFTER ALL OF

04:01:13.692 --> 04:01:14.226
THAT I JUST I WANTED TO THANK

04:01:14.293 --> 04:01:17.129
YOU. WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

04:01:17.196 --> 04:01:19.731
DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS- AND

04:01:19.798 --> 04:01:21.366
MANY OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS

04:01:21.433 --> 04:01:22.901
USE FLEXIBILITY IS WITHIN OUR

04:01:22.968 --> 04:01:25.337
CURRENT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE

04:01:25.404 --> 04:01:27.940
TO ADDRESS CURRENT ISSUES. CAN

04:01:28.006 --> 04:01:29.641
YOU ELABORATE OR OF ANY OF THE

04:01:29.708 --> 04:01:31.610
OTHERS WOULD LIKE TO ELABORATE

04:01:31.677 --> 04:01:32.377
ON ANY PARTICULAR

04:01:32.444 --> 04:01:34.546
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU SEE A

04:01:34.613 --> 04:01:38.150
NEED TO PRIORITIZE. IN ORDER TO

04:01:38.217 --> 04:01:40.652
ENSURE UNINTERRUPTED CARE FOR

04:01:40.719 --> 04:01:43.055
SENIORS AND THOSE IN THE

04:01:43.121 --> 04:01:45.624
LIVING- AND THOSE LIVING WITH

04:01:45.691 --> 04:01:48.160
WITH DISABILITIES. IF AND WHEN

04:01:48.227 --> 04:01:50.028
OUR STATUS IT WITH THE SECOND

04:01:50.095 --> 04:01:56.969
WAVE OF COVERT. WELL I HAVE

04:01:57.035 --> 04:01:58.804
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY AS

04:01:58.871 --> 04:02:01.506
A WHOLE AND HOW THE LONG TERM

04:02:01.573 --> 04:02:03.175
EFFECTS ARE GOING TO BE YOU

04:02:03.242 --> 04:02:04.877
KNOW LAST YEAR THERE WERE

04:02:04.943 --> 04:02:07.079
PEOPLE THAT FELL AND WENT INTO

04:02:07.145 --> 04:02:08.914
A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND

04:02:08.981 --> 04:02:12.251
GOT GREAT CARE THANK THEY WERE

04:02:12.317 --> 04:02:14.686
REHABILITATED ON HOW TO WALK

04:02:14.753 --> 04:02:16.855
AGAIN WITH THAT NEW HIP AND

04:02:16.922 --> 04:02:17.990
THEY'RE GONNA GET TEN TO

04:02:18.056 --> 04:02:19.625
FIFTEEN GOOD YEARS FROM THAT

04:02:19.691 --> 04:02:22.594
REHABILITATION AND I AM VERY

04:02:22.661 --> 04:02:24.863
CONCERNED THAT THOSE SAME

04:02:24.930 --> 04:02:26.365
SENIORS THAT ARE FALLING AND

04:02:26.431 --> 04:02:27.699
HAVING YOUR HIPS REPLACED IN A

04:02:27.766 --> 04:02:29.935
HOSPITAL ARE NOW SO FEARFUL OF

04:02:30.002 --> 04:02:30.936
GETTING CODED THAT THEY'RE

04:02:31.003 --> 04:02:32.170
GOING HOME AND THEY'RE BY

04:02:32.237 --> 04:02:33.772
PASSING ALL OF THAT GREAT

04:02:33.839 --> 04:02:35.741
REHABILITATION. AND THEY'RE NOT

04:02:35.807 --> 04:02:37.209
GOING TO GET TEN TO FIFTEEN

04:02:37.276 --> 04:02:38.377
GOOD YEARS ON THAT HIT BECAUSE

04:02:38.443 --> 04:02:39.478
THEY DIDN'T GET THE BENEFIT

04:02:39.544 --> 04:02:40.379
THEY DIDN'T GET THE REHAB AT

04:02:40.445 --> 04:02:42.481
THE BEGINNING SO WE DO HAVE TO

04:02:42.547 --> 04:02:44.116
MAKE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY

04:02:44.182 --> 04:02:46.151
SAFE AGAIN I THINK TESTING

04:02:46.218 --> 04:02:50.222
TESTING TESTING PP PP PP I

04:02:50.289 --> 04:02:51.757
THINK WE NEED TO HAVE WASHING

04:02:51.823 --> 04:02:52.991
STATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE

04:02:53.058 --> 04:02:54.893
BUILDING AND WE HAVE BRUNO'S

04:02:54.960 --> 04:02:56.461
STANDING OVER THEM MAKING SURE

04:02:56.528 --> 04:02:57.963
THAT EVERYBODY ACTUALLY WASHES

04:02:58.030 --> 04:02:59.865
THEIR HANDS FOR THE FULL HAPPY

04:02:59.932 --> 04:03:03.068
BIRTHDAY TWO TIMES. IF THEY- WE

04:03:03.135 --> 04:03:06.038
HAVE TO. WE HAVE TO DO FIT

04:03:06.104 --> 04:03:09.741
TESTING WE HAVE TO PROVIDE CARE

04:03:09.808 --> 04:03:12.577
INSTRUCTION IN NATIVE LANGUAGE

04:03:12.644 --> 04:03:14.680
SO THE CARE GIVERS NOTE TO

04:03:14.746 --> 04:03:16.481
THEIR CORE WHY THEY SHOULD BE

04:03:16.548 --> 04:03:18.784
WEARING THESE MASKS TOO OFTEN

04:03:18.850 --> 04:03:20.352
WE'RE HEARING REPORTS OF CARE

04:03:20.419 --> 04:03:21.720
GIVERS THAT WHERE THE MASS

04:03:21.787 --> 04:03:23.956
WHILE THE PROVIDING DIRECT CARE

04:03:24.022 --> 04:03:24.556
TO THE RESIDENTS BUT THEN THEY

04:03:24.623 --> 04:03:26.491
GO BACK TO THEIR BREAK ROOMS

04:03:26.558 --> 04:03:27.059
AND THEY'RE NOT WEARING THE

04:03:27.125 --> 04:03:29.561
MASKS ANYMORE. THAT THAT'S HOW

04:03:29.628 --> 04:03:31.897
WE GET THE SPREAD THAT'S HOW WE

04:03:31.964 --> 04:03:34.566
GET THE- NON SYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE

04:03:34.633 --> 04:03:36.401
THAT ARE PASSING THIS DISEASE.

04:03:36.468 --> 04:03:40.372
SO I WOULD SAY- WHATEVER WE CAN

04:03:40.439 --> 04:03:44.443
DO TO INCREASE THE USE OF PP TO

04:03:44.509 --> 04:03:46.078
TAKE IT OUT OF THE POLITICAL

04:03:46.144 --> 04:03:48.280
REALM AND JUST MAKE IT A PUBLIC

04:03:48.347 --> 04:03:52.050
SAFETY. AND HAND WASHING. THE

04:03:52.117 --> 04:03:54.953
ANTIBACTERIAL GOO IS GREAT BUT

04:03:55.020 --> 04:03:57.155
IT DOES NOT BE A GOOD TWENTY

04:03:57.222 --> 04:04:00.359
SECONDS OF HAND WASHING. AND

04:04:00.425 --> 04:04:06.965
MARK MY LAST QUESTION IS. HOW

04:04:07.032 --> 04:04:08.934
DO YOU OR HOW DID IT HAPPEN HOW

04:04:09.001 --> 04:04:10.669
DO WE PLAN TO USE THE

04:04:10.736 --> 04:04:12.471
RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENSURE THAT

04:04:12.537 --> 04:04:15.140
INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY

04:04:15.207 --> 04:04:16.942
FOR MEDI CAL HAVE ACCESS TO

04:04:17.009 --> 04:04:19.111
NECESSARY HEALTH SERVICES

04:04:19.177 --> 04:04:25.017
DURING THE PANDEMIC. SOMEBODY

04:04:25.083 --> 04:04:26.451
ELSE WHO CAN ANSWER THAT

04:04:26.518 --> 04:04:27.019
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A GOOD

04:04:27.085 --> 04:04:30.789
ANSWER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:04:30.856 --> 04:04:33.725
REGISTERED CLEAR RAMSEY- AND

04:04:33.792 --> 04:04:35.660
JUSTICE IN AGING. YEAH I DON'T

04:04:35.727 --> 04:04:37.062
HAVE A PERFECT ANSWER THAT

04:04:37.129 --> 04:04:38.997
QUESTION I THINK IT'S A VERY.

04:04:39.064 --> 04:04:40.899
COMPLEX ANSWER GIVEN THAT YOU

04:04:40.966 --> 04:04:42.334
KNOW OUR SYSTEM IS BUILT VERY

04:04:42.401 --> 04:04:44.169
HEAVILY ON USING META CAL

04:04:44.236 --> 04:04:48.106
DOLLARS FOR- COMMUNITY SERVICES

04:04:48.173 --> 04:04:50.175
AND ON- INSTITUTIONAL LONG TERM

04:04:50.242 --> 04:04:53.345
CARE. BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS

04:04:53.412 --> 04:04:55.414
FOR EXAMPLE BE- COMMUNITY

04:04:55.480 --> 04:04:58.083
LIVING FIND COULD BE USED UP TO

04:04:58.150 --> 04:05:00.886
NON MEDICARE HOW RECIPIENTS- WE

04:05:00.952 --> 04:05:02.687
COULD LOOK AT WAYS THAT-

04:05:02.754 --> 04:05:04.456
MEDICARE COULD HELP PEOPLE

04:05:04.523 --> 04:05:06.391
RAPID. RESPONSE INTENSIVE CASE

04:05:06.458 --> 04:05:10.128
MANAGEMENT- AND WE ALSO HAVE.

04:05:10.195 --> 04:05:11.863
WAYS TO HELP PEOPLE BECOME

04:05:11.930 --> 04:05:13.298
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE HEALTH

04:05:13.365 --> 04:05:14.232
FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S SOMETHING

04:05:14.299 --> 04:05:18.236
CALLED THE SELF. IMPOVERISHMENT

04:05:18.303 --> 04:05:20.038
PROVISIONS WHICH ALLOW. OR WHEN.

04:05:20.105 --> 04:05:20.572
WOULD NEED LEVEL OF AT A

04:05:20.639 --> 04:05:22.607
NURSING HOME BUT THEY COULD BE

04:05:22.674 --> 04:05:24.009
FIXED SERVICES IN THEIR HOME

04:05:24.076 --> 04:05:25.177
THEY CAN QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL

04:05:25.243 --> 04:05:26.611
WITHOUT HAVING TO SPEND DOWN TO

04:05:26.678 --> 04:05:27.979
A LEVEL THAT MEDIC CAL NORMALLY

04:05:28.046 --> 04:05:29.848
REQUIRES. I THINK WE HAVE TO

04:05:29.915 --> 04:05:32.551
CURRENT. ABILITY TO HELP PEOPLE

04:05:32.617 --> 04:05:33.718
BUT I THINK YOU'VE HIT UPON A

04:05:33.785 --> 04:05:36.154
MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM WHICH IS.

04:05:36.221 --> 04:05:38.957
THAT WE DEPEND SO HEAVILY ON

04:05:39.024 --> 04:05:40.959
MEDICARE OUT FOR HOME AND

04:05:41.026 --> 04:05:41.460
COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES

04:05:41.526 --> 04:05:44.629
PROGRAM. I DO ALSO THINK SO- WE

04:05:44.696 --> 04:05:46.098
COULD HELP BY EXPANDING OUR

04:05:46.164 --> 04:05:48.166
MEDIC HEALTH PROGRAMS. SO THAT

04:05:48.233 --> 04:05:50.268
WE'RE TAKING BURDEN OFF OF IF

04:05:50.335 --> 04:05:52.237
SOMEONE CAN GET ON TO MEDICARE

04:05:52.304 --> 04:05:54.005
THAN THEY CAN BE SERVED. ON

04:05:54.072 --> 04:05:55.140
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON

04:05:55.207 --> 04:05:57.209
WAITING LISTS WHO WOULD QUALIFY

04:05:57.275 --> 04:05:58.477
BUT DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE

04:05:58.543 --> 04:05:59.244
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE

04:05:59.311 --> 04:06:00.378
SERVICES THEY NEED TO DON'T

04:06:00.445 --> 04:06:02.481
APPLY. AND THEN HOPEFULLY YOU

04:06:02.547 --> 04:06:06.218
KNOW ALLOW SOME- ABILITY FOR

04:06:06.284 --> 04:06:09.020
OUR PRIVATE CARE GIVERS TO HAVE

04:06:09.087 --> 04:06:10.355
A SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE TO

04:06:10.422 --> 04:06:14.326
TAKE CARE BECAUSE. MEDIC HELP

04:06:14.392 --> 04:06:14.960
TAKING CARE OF THE LARGER GROUP

04:06:15.026 --> 04:06:17.028
AND AS- MEMBER CRIED TO ANSWER

04:06:17.095 --> 04:06:18.730
YOUR LAST WEEK I KNOW IS. AT

04:06:18.797 --> 04:06:20.432
WITH BUT- I'LL JUST SAY THAT I

04:06:20.499 --> 04:06:22.434
REALLY HOPE- BECAUSE SHE'D

04:06:22.501 --> 04:06:23.902
RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY CRAIG

04:06:23.969 --> 04:06:25.770
AND LISA I TOOK ONE SIDE OF THE

04:06:25.837 --> 04:06:27.873
COIN. BECAUSE WE DO NEED SAFETY

04:06:27.939 --> 04:06:29.774
IN NURSING HOMES ABSOLUTELY

04:06:29.841 --> 04:06:31.409
THERE ARE PEOPLE. WHO NEED TO

04:06:31.476 --> 04:06:34.346
THE NURSING HOME BUT IT'S THE

04:06:34.412 --> 04:06:34.980
BEST PLACEMENT FOR THEM. RIGHT

04:06:37.282 --> 04:06:38.550
CALLING THEM OUT AND MAKING

04:06:38.617 --> 04:06:40.318

04:06:42.654 --> 04:06:43.555
COULD BE WELL SERVED IN THE

04:06:43.622 --> 04:06:45.223

MISS COLEMAN. ERECTOR LIGHT

04:09:32.624 --> 04:09:34.259
BORN EARLIER SAID THAT THERE

04:09:34.326 --> 04:09:36.494
WAS A MISSING LINK IN THE

04:09:36.561 --> 04:09:39.264
CONTINUUM OF ARE. AND WANTED

TO GET YOUR ASSESSMENT ON

04:09:41.933 --> 04:09:44.602
WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S TRUE.

04:09:44.669 --> 04:09:46.338
ABSOLUTELY THAT IS TRUE EIGHT

04:09:46.404 --> 04:09:50.442
OUT WE. WE HAVE VERY BLANKET

04:09:50.508 --> 04:09:52.677
YOU EITHER FIT INTO THIS COLUMN

04:09:52.744 --> 04:09:55.046
BECAUSE YOU HAVE FUNDS OR YOU

04:09:55.113 --> 04:09:57.048
DON'T HAVE FUNDS AND SO YOU'RE

04:09:57.115 --> 04:10:00.218
RELEGATED INTO THIS ARENA WE

04:10:00.285 --> 04:10:03.421
ARE TRYING TO COMBINE TO WHAT I

04:10:03.488 --> 04:10:04.756
THINK OF IS TWO VERY DIFFERENT

04:10:04.823 --> 04:10:07.058
GROUPS WE HAVE OLDER ADULTS WHO

04:10:07.125 --> 04:10:09.127
ARE DEAF WHO HAVE DISABILITIES.

04:10:09.194 --> 04:10:10.862
AND THEN WE HAVE OLDER ADULTS

04:10:10.929 --> 04:10:13.531
WHO HAVE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT

04:10:13.598 --> 04:10:15.333
AND THOSE TWO GROUPS SHOULD NOT

04:10:15.400 --> 04:10:17.335
BE TREATED THE SAME WELL THE

04:10:17.402 --> 04:10:19.704
PERSON THAT HAS A SHARP MIND

04:10:19.771 --> 04:10:21.539
BUT HAS MEDICAL CONDITIONS

04:10:21.606 --> 04:10:23.441
MIGHT BE VERY WELL SUITED IN

04:10:23.508 --> 04:10:25.810
HOME UTILIZING CARE GIVERS

04:10:25.877 --> 04:10:27.579
BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE

04:10:27.645 --> 04:10:29.247
SUCCESSFULLY THEIR CARE NEEDS

04:10:29.314 --> 04:10:30.548
BEING ABLE TO ANTICIPATE WHEN

04:10:30.615 --> 04:10:32.717
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED CARE. AT

04:10:32.784 --> 04:10:34.185
AN OLDER ADULT WITH A COGNITIVE

04:10:34.252 --> 04:10:35.754
IMPAIRMENT THAT JUST DOESN'T

04:10:35.820 --> 04:10:37.756
WORK YOU CAN'T TAKE A PERSON

04:10:37.822 --> 04:10:39.391
WITH ADVANCED DEMENTIA AND SAY

04:10:39.457 --> 04:10:40.158
WELL I'M GOING TO PROVIDE THEM

04:10:40.225 --> 04:10:41.960
WITH CARE AT BREAKFAST AND

04:10:42.026 --> 04:10:43.361
SHOWERS AND THEN SOMEONE ELSE

04:10:43.428 --> 04:10:45.663
WILL STOP IRAN LUNCH AND THEN

04:10:45.730 --> 04:10:46.598
SOMEONE ELSE TO COME AND PUT

04:10:46.664 --> 04:10:47.866
HIM TO BED AT NIGHT. THAT WOULD

04:10:47.932 --> 04:10:49.167
BE LIKE THE SAME AS SAYING WANT

04:10:49.234 --> 04:10:51.936
GET- SIX HOURS A DAY SPREAD OUT

04:10:52.003 --> 04:10:53.405
OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY FOR

04:10:53.471 --> 04:10:54.205
MY SIX YEAR OLD TO GET STATE

04:10:54.272 --> 04:10:56.908
KERR IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND

04:10:56.975 --> 04:10:59.310
WE'RE TRYING TO. USE THESE

04:10:59.377 --> 04:11:01.079
PROGRAMS FOR TWO VERY

04:11:01.146 --> 04:11:03.915
DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT

04:11:03.982 --> 04:11:05.417
POPULATIONS. I KNOW THAT THERE

04:11:05.483 --> 04:11:07.886
ARE MANY FAMILIES THAT ARE

04:11:07.952 --> 04:11:09.421
STRUGGLING DOING THE VERY BEST

04:11:09.487 --> 04:11:10.989
THEY CAN TO KEEP MOM AND DAD AT

04:11:11.055 --> 04:11:13.658
HOME SAFE. I ALSO KNOW THERE'S

04:11:13.725 --> 04:11:16.394
A LOT OF OLDER ADULTS THAT ARE

04:11:16.461 --> 04:11:19.164
EXPERIENCING SUCH SEVERE SOCIAL

04:11:19.230 --> 04:11:21.466
ISOLATION. BECAUSE WE'RE

04:11:21.533 --> 04:11:23.501
KEEPING THEM AT HOME ALONE.

04:11:23.568 --> 04:11:25.036
INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THEM TO

04:11:25.103 --> 04:11:27.038
LIVE IN A COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT

04:11:27.105 --> 04:11:28.706
I CAN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY

04:11:28.773 --> 04:11:30.108
WHERE THEY STILL HAVE THEIR OWN

04:11:30.175 --> 04:11:31.176
APARTMENT THEY STILL HAVE THEIR

04:11:31.242 --> 04:11:32.610
OWN BATHROOM THEY HAVE THEIR

04:11:32.677 --> 04:11:34.746
OWN PERSONAL SPACE. BUT THEY

04:11:34.813 --> 04:11:36.181
ALSO GET TO BENEFIT FROM HAVING

04:11:36.247 --> 04:11:39.851
A COMMUNITY TO BE AROUND THEM.

04:11:39.918 --> 04:11:42.654
SO YES I DO THINK THE- DIRECTOR

04:11:42.720 --> 04:11:45.123
HAS HIT UPON EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT

04:11:45.190 --> 04:11:46.825
DISTINCT PROBLEM IN THE SYSTEM.

04:11:46.891 --> 04:11:49.227
WE ARE TRYING TO COVER TOO

04:11:49.294 --> 04:11:52.630
WIDE. A POPULATION WITH TOO

04:11:52.697 --> 04:11:55.400
NARROW A FRESH. I WILL

04:11:55.467 --> 04:11:56.768
APPRECIATE THAT MISS COLEMAN

04:11:56.835 --> 04:11:58.369

SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND

04:12:02.507 --> 04:12:05.477
THAT THAT- UNDERSTANDING OF HOW

04:12:05.543 --> 04:12:07.245
THE SYSTEMS WORK IS INCREDIBLY

04:12:07.312 --> 04:12:09.013
IMPORTANT FOR US AS LEGISLATORS

04:12:09.080 --> 04:12:12.484
AND- BELIEVE IT ALLOWS US TO.

04:12:12.550 --> 04:12:14.419
SEE THAT THERE IS A NEED TO

04:12:14.486 --> 04:12:16.654
WORK ON THIS PROBLEM. BUT WE

04:12:16.721 --> 04:12:18.656
HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. AND SO

04:12:18.723 --> 04:12:20.425
WITH THAT IF I COULD THE FINAL

04:12:20.492 --> 04:12:21.826

I WOULD SAY WERE I SEE THAT THE

04:13:26.758 --> 04:13:27.458
NEED IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

04:13:27.525 --> 04:13:31.095

MAKING SURE THAT WE BASICALLY

04:13:40.505 --> 04:13:41.773
CAN EXPAND A PROGRAM THAT

04:13:41.839 --> 04:13:44.108
ALREADY WORK. AND JUST APPLY IT

04:13:44.175 --> 04:13:45.643
TO A LARGER POPULATION AND ONE

04:13:45.710 --> 04:13:48.012
THAT WE KNOW MAKES UP THE VAST

04:13:48.079 --> 04:13:49.547
MAJORITY OF BURDENS AND

04:13:49.614 --> 04:13:51.549
EVERYTHING HOMES. I THINK WE DO

04:13:51.616 --> 04:13:53.585
NEED TO FIND A WAY TO DO SOME

04:13:53.651 --> 04:13:55.887
INCREASING OF CAPACITY WITHIN

04:13:58.923 --> 04:14:01.359
THINK I JUST GOT TWENTY HOURS-

04:14:01.426 --> 04:14:03.261
VERY DOABLE QUICKLY BECAUSE

04:14:03.328 --> 04:14:04.262
THAT ALREADY EXISTS AND IT

04:14:04.329 --> 04:14:09.500
DOESN'T REQUIRE. A LOT OF

04:14:09.567 --> 04:14:11.536
ADDITIONAL. CLICK OR A LOT OF

04:14:11.603 --> 04:14:13.638
CHANGES BUT I SAY THAT I. THE

04:14:13.705 --> 04:14:16.374
NEED FOR ADDITIONAL. AS WELL-

04:14:16.441 --> 04:14:19.377
IF YOU CAN- PUT MONEY INTO THE

04:14:19.444 --> 04:14:20.545
INTO THE PROGRAM AND THEN

04:14:20.612 --> 04:14:23.081
LASTLY I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT

04:14:23.147 --> 04:14:24.148
NUMBER ELEVEN BECAUSE IT DOES

04:14:24.215 --> 04:14:25.917
SEEM. TO BE FAIRLY OUT OF

04:14:25.984 --> 04:14:27.018
CONTROL THAT WE MIGHT LET

04:14:27.085 --> 04:14:28.620
PEOPLE WHO ARE POSITIVE FOR

04:14:28.686 --> 04:14:29.787
KOBE D. GOING INTO NURSING

04:14:29.854 --> 04:14:31.122
HOMES TO GOING BACK INTO THEIR

04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:32.490
OWN HOME AND INTO THE COMMUNITY

04:14:32.557 --> 04:14:35.727
AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT. SO

04:14:35.793 --> 04:14:37.829
I THINK THERE IS. A REAL NEED

04:14:37.895 --> 04:14:39.931
IMMEDIATELY FOR TESTING BUT I

04:14:39.998 --> 04:14:41.499
WILL SAY THAT NUMBER TWELVE YOU

04:14:41.566 --> 04:14:42.934
KNOW WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO

04:14:43.001 --> 04:14:45.003
TAKE RISKS AND ALL THE FOCUS ON

04:14:45.069 --> 04:14:46.871
WORKERS I THINK IT'S BEEN. VERY

04:14:46.938 --> 04:14:49.874
IMPORTANT AND THAT TO ME IS-

04:14:49.941 --> 04:14:51.576
UNDERLINED BY RECOMMENDATION

04:14:51.643 --> 04:14:52.644
TWELVE WHICH IS REALLY SAYING

04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:54.512
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET OUR HOME

04:14:54.579 --> 04:14:57.782
CARE WORKERS ARE. NURSING HOME

04:14:57.849 --> 04:14:58.750
WORKERS ARE COMMUNICATE WORKERS.

04:14:58.816 --> 04:15:01.119
DO THE JOB WITHOUT PROPER

04:15:01.185 --> 04:15:04.555
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT SO- THAT

04:15:04.622 --> 04:15:05.690
WOULD BE FOR MY PARTICIPATION

04:15:05.757 --> 04:15:07.191
BUT I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE

04:15:07.258 --> 04:15:09.427
OTHERS WHO WOULD- WHO MIGHT.

04:15:09.494 --> 04:15:11.429
EVEN DIFFERENT WAY. NO THAT'S

04:15:11.496 --> 04:15:13.164
INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND I AGREE

04:15:13.231 --> 04:15:14.432

TO IMPERIAL I'VE SPENT THE LAST

04:23:41.238 --> 04:23:43.474
TWO WEEKS ON THE ROAD IN SIX

04:23:43.541 --> 04:23:44.141

TO FACE- BOTH WALKING THROUGH

04:23:52.650 --> 04:23:53.384
THOSE FACILITIES THAT ARE

04:23:53.450 --> 04:23:56.187
HARDEST HIT. AS WELL AS WORKING

04:23:56.253 --> 04:23:56.787
WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

04:23:56.854 --> 04:23:59.823
OFFICERS- I FOUND OFF IN ONE OF

04:23:59.890 --> 04:24:01.425
THOSE STRATEGIES- THAT THAT

04:24:01.492 --> 04:24:04.028
IT'S BEEN HELPFUL- IN THAT KIND

04:24:04.094 --> 04:24:05.362
OF LEAVING OUT SOME OF THESE

04:24:05.429 --> 04:24:07.531
ISSUES AROUND I THINK THAT.

04:24:07.598 --> 04:24:09.466
THAT REPRESENTATIVE MATHIS WHO

04:24:09.533 --> 04:24:11.502
POINTED OUT AS WELL AS SOME OF

04:24:11.569 --> 04:24:12.636

COUNTY AUTHORITY THE STATE

04:24:15.506 --> 04:24:16.874
AUTHORITY AND THAT THE FEDERAL

04:24:16.941 --> 04:24:19.109
CMS WHO ACTUALLY- CERTIFIES

04:24:19.176 --> 04:24:20.177
THESE FACILITIES THERE ARE

04:24:20.244 --> 04:24:21.879
FORTY. AND SOMETIMES THAT HAS

04:24:21.946 --> 04:24:23.380
TO BE A CONVERSATION TOGETHER

04:24:23.447 --> 04:24:25.149
WITH THOSE FACILITIES- TEATHER

04:24:25.216 --> 04:24:26.850
LEVEL SET OR MAKE SURE THAT

04:24:26.917 --> 04:24:31.388
THEY HAVE THAT. THE RESOURCES

04:24:31.455 --> 04:24:32.856
NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL A FEW

04:24:32.923 --> 04:24:34.258
THINGS THAT I WON TO TOUCH ON.

04:24:34.325 --> 04:24:36.260
AS I WAS I. THERE'S A FEW

04:24:36.327 --> 04:24:38.362
QUESTIONS PRIOR. BUT YOU KNOW

04:24:38.429 --> 04:24:40.231
WHAT ARE SOME LESSONS LEARNED-

04:24:40.297 --> 04:24:41.999
WHAT HAVE WE CHANGE NOW WOULD

04:24:42.066 --> 04:24:42.800
HAVE BEEN SIX OF SOME

04:24:42.866 --> 04:24:44.702
STRATEGIES THAT SEEM TO WORK.

04:24:44.768 --> 04:24:47.504
AND WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATUS.

04:24:47.571 --> 04:24:48.939
OF ONE OF THE QUICK THINGS THAT

04:24:49.006 --> 04:24:50.040
WE FOUND OUT EARLY ON THE

04:24:50.107 --> 04:24:51.508
PANDEMIC IS THAT A FACILITY CAN

04:24:51.575 --> 04:24:54.178
CHANGE. DRASTICALLY WITHIN

04:24:54.245 --> 04:24:55.045
FORTY EIGHT HOURS. THANK

04:24:55.112 --> 04:24:57.281
MAGNOLIA- IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF

04:24:57.348 --> 04:24:58.882
THAT THAT HAPPENED IN APRIL

04:24:58.949 --> 04:25:01.719
WHERE ARE STATE STAFF IN THERE

04:25:01.785 --> 04:25:02.720
TWO DAYS PRIOR TO THE

04:25:02.786 --> 04:25:04.622
EVACUATION. AND WHAT WE FOUND

04:25:04.688 --> 04:25:06.624
IS THAT. YOU CAN HAVE ALL OF

04:25:06.690 --> 04:25:08.325
THE GREAT BEST LAID PLANS IN

04:25:08.392 --> 04:25:10.094
PLACE WITH INFECTION PREVENTION%

04:25:10.160 --> 04:25:11.829
AND EVERYTHING LOOKING COPA

04:25:11.895 --> 04:25:13.163
STATIC. BUT THE MOMENT THAT

04:25:13.230 --> 04:25:16.400
THERE IS THAT- IMPACT OF COATED

04:25:16.467 --> 04:25:17.935
WE HAVE FOUND VARIOUS DEGREES

04:25:18.002 --> 04:25:21.071
OF REACTIONS- IN A FACILITY. IN

04:25:21.138 --> 04:25:22.573
UNDERSTANDING THAT STAFFING AND

04:25:22.640 --> 04:25:25.409
PP- ARE CRITICAL AND WE

04:25:25.476 --> 04:25:27.111
DISCOVERED EARLY ON AND DID A

04:25:27.177 --> 04:25:28.812
CASE STUDY ON THIS. AND FOUND

04:25:28.879 --> 04:25:30.648
THAT YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH ALL

04:25:30.714 --> 04:25:32.583
FACILITIES HAVE EMERGENCY PLANS

04:25:32.650 --> 04:25:34.218
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY-

04:25:34.285 --> 04:25:36.420
SPECIFICALLY- TALK ABOUT

04:25:36.487 --> 04:25:38.289
CONTINGENCY PLANS WITH HOPE IT.

04:25:38.355 --> 04:25:39.523
IN SO THAT'S WHY WE WERE THE

04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:41.358
FIRST AND ONLY STATE TO REQUIRE

04:25:41.425 --> 04:25:42.926
MITIGATION PLANS OF ALL OF OUR

04:25:42.993 --> 04:25:44.728
FACILITIES. AND AS CRAIG HAD

04:25:44.795 --> 04:25:46.297
MENTIONED WE'RE NOW ON SITE

04:25:46.363 --> 04:25:48.132
MORE THAN EVER IN FACT I THINK

04:25:48.198 --> 04:25:49.900
I TRACKED. IN THE THREE MONTHS

04:25:49.967 --> 04:25:53.737
BETWEEN. APRIL AND- JULY WE

04:25:53.804 --> 04:25:55.673
WERE ON SITE A THOUSAND TIMES

04:25:55.739 --> 04:25:56.874
MORE THAN WE WERE IN THE PRIOR

04:25:56.940 --> 04:25:58.909
YEAR. AND THAT KIND OF CADENCE

04:25:58.976 --> 04:26:01.178
AND OVERSIGHT AND PHYSICALLY

04:26:01.245 --> 04:26:02.313
JUST BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN THE

04:26:02.379 --> 04:26:04.048
FACILITY I BELIEVE HAS MADE A

04:26:04.114 --> 04:26:05.282
DIFFERENCE AND THAT'S EXACTLY

04:26:05.349 --> 04:26:06.984
WHY. WHEN WE LOK AT KIND OF

04:26:07.051 --> 04:26:08.352
REGULATORY REFORM WE'RE LOOKING

04:26:08.419 --> 04:26:09.586
AT WHAT THE CADENCE OF

04:26:09.653 --> 04:26:10.454
FREQUENCY THAT WERE IN

04:26:10.521 --> 04:26:11.989
FACILITIES. THAT'S WHY THAT'S A

04:26:12.056 --> 04:26:13.857
BIG PART OF THE PUSH FOR DPH TO

04:26:13.924 --> 04:26:19.330
CONTINUE. THAT GOING FORWARD. I

04:26:19.396 --> 04:26:20.397
THE OTHER PIECES WAS. A BIG FAN

04:26:20.464 --> 04:26:21.565
HERE IS THAT WHICH WAS

04:26:21.632 --> 04:26:23.300

HAVE BEEN DEEMED OKAY- BY THE

04:26:54.898 --> 04:26:56.433

STRIKE TEAMS HAVE BEEN WHAT'S

04:27:33.137 --> 04:27:34.238
THE LAST TIME THAT WE WENT IN

WITH- ALL OF THE CASE RATES

04:28:56.687 --> 04:28:59.756
AND- OUTBREAKS IN A REGION WERE

04:28:59.823 --> 04:29:01.859
ABLE TO HAVE A HIGH RISK LIST

04:29:01.925 --> 04:29:03.026
IN EACH DAY ON OUR SNIFF

04:29:03.093 --> 04:29:04.561
WEBSITE WE DO POST WITH THAT

04:29:04.628 --> 04:29:06.396
HIGH RISK LIST IS. AND THEN WE

04:29:06.463 --> 04:29:07.998
ALSO DO TO KEEP THAT LIST BY

04:29:08.065 --> 04:29:09.600

STRIKE TEAM WHAT WE OFTEN DO-

04:39:47.837 --> 04:39:49.072
IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

04:39:49.139 --> 04:39:50.507
DEPENDING ON ON THE LOCAL

04:39:50.573 --> 04:39:51.407

AND EVEN TO JUST GET TO A PLACE

04:40:15.999 --> 04:40:17.066
ONE ACTION THAT WE HAVE BEEN

04:40:17.133 --> 04:40:18.601
TAKING AS SOMETHING AS A TAKE

04:40:18.668 --> 04:40:21.804
AWAY. IS THAT POST PANDEMIC-

04:40:21.871 --> 04:40:23.239
EVEN DURING POINT DEMOCRAT

04:40:23.306 --> 04:40:24.474
FORTY STARTED THIS IS

04:40:24.541 --> 04:40:26.409
RECRUITING FOR OUR SURVEYORS IN

04:40:26.476 --> 04:40:27.443
OUR STRIKE TEAMS ARE OUR

04:40:27.510 --> 04:40:28.945
INFECTION CONTROL SPECIALIST

04:40:29.012 --> 04:40:30.713
NOT NECESSARILY NEAR A BRICK

04:40:30.780 --> 04:40:32.749
AND MORTAR- HEALTH CARE

04:40:32.815 --> 04:40:35.618
FACILITY- A STATE HEALTH CARE

04:40:35.685 --> 04:40:37.120
FACILITY BROKEN WATER LOCATION

04:40:37.187 --> 04:40:39.389
AND SO- THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT

04:40:39.455 --> 04:40:40.790
HAD BEEN DONE FOR YEARS WHERE

04:40:40.857 --> 04:40:42.225
WE'D HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAVE

04:40:42.292 --> 04:40:42.759
TWELVE DIFFERENT DISTRICT

04:40:42.825 --> 04:40:44.994
OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE. AND

04:40:45.061 --> 04:40:45.528
PEOPLE WOULD BE GENERALLY

04:40:45.595 --> 04:40:46.796
LOCATED NEAR THE DISTRICT

04:40:46.863 --> 04:40:47.931
OFFICE AND SOMETIMES HAVETO

04:40:47.997 --> 04:40:50.433
DRIVE TWELVE YOU KNOW FOUR TO

04:40:50.500 --> 04:40:51.134
FIVE HOURS JUST TO GET TO A

04:40:51.201 --> 04:40:53.336
FACILITY. SO NOW WE'RE DOING A

04:40:53.403 --> 04:40:54.938
VERY CONCENTRATED EFFORT TO DO

04:40:55.004 --> 04:40:56.105
STATEWIDE RECRUITMENT

04:40:56.172 --> 04:40:57.373
ESPECIALLY NOW IN THE DAYS THAT

04:40:57.440 --> 04:40:58.541
WERE BEING ABLE TO DO OUR OUR

04:40:58.608 --> 04:41:00.443
PROCESSES MORE ELECTRONICALLY

04:41:00.510 --> 04:41:01.311
SO THEY CAN BE ABLE TO TELL

04:41:01.377 --> 04:41:02.979
WORK AND WORK FROM HOME. AND BE

04:41:03.046 --> 04:41:04.247
MORE AGILE AND GET TO

04:41:04.314 --> 04:41:05.882
FACILITIES MUCH QUICKER THAN

04:41:05.949 --> 04:41:07.717
THEY HAD IN THE PAST AND SO I

04:41:07.784 --> 04:41:08.751
JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT

04:41:08.818 --> 04:41:10.186
THAT APPRECIATE YOU- BROUGHT

04:41:10.253 --> 04:41:11.588
THAT UP EARLIER ABOUT JUST EVEN

04:41:11.654 --> 04:41:14.791
THE GEOGRAPHY. OF GETTING- TWO

04:41:14.857 --> 04:41:16.359
LOCATIONS FAST BUT WHEN WE DO

04:41:16.426 --> 04:41:17.760
SEND OUT A STRIKE TEAM ARE

04:41:17.827 --> 04:41:18.895
USUALLY ARE ARE HEALTHCARE

04:41:18.962 --> 04:41:20.530
CHOIR INSPECTIONS EXPERTS WHO

04:41:20.597 --> 04:41:21.898
WILL KIND OF GO OVER TECHNICAL

04:41:21.965 --> 04:41:23.266
ASSISTANCE AND TRY TO MAKE SURE

04:41:23.333 --> 04:41:27.237
THAT. THERE ARE JUST EFFECTIVE

04:41:27.303 --> 04:41:28.037
INFECTION CAN TROY MEASURES.

04:41:28.104 --> 04:41:28.605
AND THEN ALSO HAVE A REGULAR

04:41:28.671 --> 04:41:30.440
TEAM THOSE ARE SURVEYORS. THOSE

04:41:30.506 --> 04:41:31.441
ARE ONES THAT ARE GOING OUT FOR

04:41:31.507 --> 04:41:33.443
COMPLIANCE- WILL SITE FOR

04:41:33.509 --> 04:41:35.945
COMPLIANCE- WE HAVE HAD AN

04:41:36.012 --> 04:41:38.014
INCREASE- OVER THE COURSE THE

04:41:38.081 --> 04:41:39.382
DURATION WE HAD AN INCREASE OF

04:41:39.449 --> 04:41:40.283
UP WHAT WE CALL IMMEDIATE

04:41:40.350 --> 04:41:42.952
JEOPARDY. WHICH IS THE- MOST

04:41:43.019 --> 04:41:46.422
AGREE JUST FORM. A VIOLATION-

04:41:46.489 --> 04:41:48.391
AND THAT HAS NOW TAPER DOWN I

04:41:48.458 --> 04:41:51.394
NOTICED IN JULY WE HAD- LESS I

04:41:51.461 --> 04:41:54.597
CHASE AND WE DID IN BEIJING-

04:41:54.664 --> 04:41:58.067
THAT MAY AND JUNE AND- OF EARLY

04:41:58.134 --> 04:41:58.901
JULY SO I. THINK THAT'S IN A

04:41:58.968 --> 04:42:00.603
GOOD TREND. THAT WE'RE SEEING

04:42:00.670 --> 04:42:01.604
LESS OF THOSE TYPES OF

04:42:01.671 --> 04:42:03.473
SITUATIONS- PROBABLY BECAUSE

04:42:03.539 --> 04:42:05.842
WE'RE OUT THERE FOR- AND THEN

04:42:05.908 --> 04:42:08.678
THERE HAVE BEEN- SOME CASES

04:42:08.745 --> 04:42:11.014
WHERE WE STAY AND WE MIGHT. BE

04:42:11.080 --> 04:42:13.182
PHYSICALLY BT WE KEEP IN-

04:42:13.249 --> 04:42:14.517
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL

04:42:14.584 --> 04:42:16.286
PUBLIC HEALTH SO KERN COUNTY IS

04:42:16.352 --> 04:42:17.520
ONE WHERE I KNOW SOME OF OUR

04:42:17.587 --> 04:42:19.956
STAFF HAD DAILY PHONE CALLS-

04:42:20.023 --> 04:42:21.124
EVERY DAY GOING OVER THE

04:42:21.190 --> 04:42:22.191
DIFFERENT FACILITIES WHAT ARE

04:42:22.258 --> 04:42:23.960
THEY SEEN ENTERING FACILITIES

04:42:24.027 --> 04:42:25.561
TOGETHER AS BOTH THE STATE. AND

04:42:25.628 --> 04:42:27.630
COUNTY PARTNER. ON THAT HAS

04:42:27.697 --> 04:42:30.233
BEEN A SUCCESSFUL- OF VENTURE

04:42:30.300 --> 04:42:32.235
WHENEVER WE CAN. BE MORE

04:42:32.302 --> 04:42:33.736
CLOSELY IN LINE WITH THE LOCAL

04:42:33.803 --> 04:42:37.607
PUBLIC HEALTH BETTER. I SEE PRE

04:42:37.674 --> 04:42:38.708
PANDEMIC. THE LOCAL PUBLIC

04:42:38.775 --> 04:42:40.610
HEALTH OFFICES KIND OF DID

04:42:40.677 --> 04:42:43.413
THEIR THING AND THE- CALIFORNIA

04:42:43.479 --> 04:42:44.580
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

04:42:44.647 --> 04:42:46.516
DISTRICT OFFICES. DID THEIR

04:42:46.582 --> 04:42:48.017
PIECE BUT THEY RARELY

04:42:48.084 --> 04:42:49.619
INTERACTED AND SO THAT'S BEEN A

04:42:49.686 --> 04:42:50.853
BIG PIECE OF TRYING TO BRIDGE

04:42:50.920 --> 04:42:52.355
THOSE TWO KIND OF SILOS AND

04:42:52.422 --> 04:42:54.691
HAVING TO WORK TOGETHER- THAT'S

04:42:54.757 --> 04:42:56.192
ROUTE THE PANDEMIC BUT- WHAT

04:42:56.259 --> 04:42:58.294
I'D LIKETO SEE IS MORE OF THAT

04:42:58.361 --> 04:43:00.563
INTEGRATION EVEN POST PANDEMIC.

04:43:00.630 --> 04:43:02.298
I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH THE

04:43:02.365 --> 04:43:04.267
FACT OF THE TWO SILOS KIND OF

04:43:04.334 --> 04:43:07.370
CRASHING TOGETHER. ON A AS

04:43:07.437 --> 04:43:10.840
WE'VE HEARD TODAY- EVERY COUNTY

04:43:10.907 --> 04:43:12.442
THIS KIND OF BEEN DOING. WHAT

04:43:12.508 --> 04:43:13.776
WORKS FOR THEM AND THEIR COUNTY

04:43:13.843 --> 04:43:14.877
AND WILL WORKS FOR THEIR

04:43:14.944 --> 04:43:16.746
CONSTITUENTS AND I THINK

04:43:16.813 --> 04:43:17.747
THERE'S DEFINITELY A NEED TO

04:43:17.814 --> 04:43:20.550
HAVE- SOME CONSENSUS ACROSS THE

04:43:20.616 --> 04:43:22.585
BOARD ACROSS THE STATE TO GET

04:43:22.652 --> 04:43:24.420
THAT COLLABORATION WORKING

04:43:24.487 --> 04:43:27.190
BETTER TOGETHER. ALL THE OTHER

04:43:27.256 --> 04:43:29.792
QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU. AND

04:43:29.859 --> 04:43:31.527
OBVIOUSLY YOU GET ASKED A LOT

04:43:31.594 --> 04:43:35.164
ABOUT TESTING. BUT I'M GETTING

04:43:35.231 --> 04:43:38.334
STORIES ALL THE TIME ABOUT

04:43:38.401 --> 04:43:39.736
PEOPLE WHO SIGNED UP TO GO TO A

04:43:39.802 --> 04:43:41.971
TESTING SITE FOR WHATEVER

04:43:42.038 --> 04:43:43.773
REASON THEY THEY DON'T MAKE IT

04:43:43.840 --> 04:43:44.507
AND THEN THEY GET A LETTER IN

04:43:44.574 --> 04:43:47.643
THE MAIL THE SAYS THEY TESTED

04:43:47.710 --> 04:43:48.177
POSITIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY

04:43:48.244 --> 04:43:50.246
DIDN'T SHOW UP. SO I'M I'M

04:43:50.313 --> 04:43:51.314
HEARING THINGS LIKE THAT IN

04:43:51.381 --> 04:43:53.983

04:43:54.050 --> 04:44:00.356
THAT DRAW CONCERNS. WITH PEOPLE

04:44:00.423 --> 04:44:01.457
GETTING LETTERS EVEN THOUGH

04:44:48.438 --> 04:44:50.039
RUMOR WHERE PEOPLE ARE SAYING

THAT THEY SIGNED UP FOR A TEST

04:44:52.809 --> 04:44:54.777

04:46:18.861 --> 04:46:21.964
MMHM I TOTALLY AGREE- I WOULD

04:46:22.031 --> 04:46:23.866
SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD HAVE-

04:46:23.933 --> 04:46:25.134

04:46:31.374 --> 04:46:33.743
UNFORTUNATELY ALL OF THOSE-

04:46:33.809 --> 04:46:35.778
VERY VERY CRITICAL ISSUES

04:46:35.845 --> 04:46:37.179
AROUND TESTING TURN AROUND

04:46:37.246 --> 04:46:39.849
TIMES IS NOT UNDER MY PURVIEW

04:46:39.916 --> 04:46:41.851

WITH THE TESTING TASK FORCE

04:46:43.319 --> 04:46:45.555
SYMBOL- CAN I DEFINITELY THINK

04:46:45.621 --> 04:46:46.622
WE NEED MORE REPRESENTATION

04:46:46.689 --> 04:46:48.357
HERE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS

04:46:48.424 --> 04:46:49.525
I'M HONESTLY DON'T HAVE THE

04:47:19.889 --> 04:47:20.890
I KNOW THEY ARE WORKING

04:47:20.957 --> 04:47:23.326
FEVERISHLY- I'M TRYING TO

04:47:23.392 --> 04:47:24.961
INCREASE THE TESTING TURNAROUND

04:47:25.027 --> 04:47:27.029
TIMES. FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD IN

04:47:27.096 --> 04:47:28.531
THE FIELD IN JUST THE LAST

04:47:28.598 --> 04:47:31.567
WEEK- THE LONGEST TURNAROUND

04:47:31.634 --> 04:47:34.904
TIME- FROM A COUPLE OF WEEKS

04:47:34.971 --> 04:47:35.938
AGO WAS UPWARDS UP TO FIFTEEN

04:47:36.005 --> 04:47:38.040
DAYS- AND SOME OF THOSE SAME

04:47:38.107 --> 04:47:41.477
pVERY LENGTHY TURNAROUND TIMES.

04:47:41.544 --> 04:47:43.679
HAVE NOW MADE IT BACK IN TWO

04:47:43.746 --> 04:47:44.780
THREE DAYS WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY

04:47:44.847 --> 04:47:46.182
MUCH MORE WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO

04:47:46.248 --> 04:47:48.017
SEE SO THAT LEAVES GIVES ME

04:47:48.084 --> 04:47:51.320
SOME AMOUNT OF- RELIEF KNOWING

THAT THE TESTING TURN AROUND

04:47:53.623 --> 04:47:55.658
TIMES ARE IMPROVING- I THINK

04:47:55.725 --> 04:47:57.693
CRAIG WHEN IT ALSO MENTIONS-

04:47:57.760 --> 04:48:00.096
CMS'S RECENTLY ON THE FEDERAL

04:48:00.162 --> 04:48:02.798
GOVERNMENT HAS AND YOU- ANTIGEN

04:48:02.865 --> 04:48:05.234
TESTING- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A

04:48:05.301 --> 04:48:06.035
LOT OF CONTROVERSY AROUND THESE

04:48:06.102 --> 04:48:08.504
ANTIGEN TEST BECAUSE- THEY

04:48:08.571 --> 04:48:10.106
DON'T HAVE THE SAME ADVOCACY

04:48:10.172 --> 04:48:12.174
RATE. AS A TRADITIONAL PCR

04:48:12.241 --> 04:48:14.844
TEST- AT THIS POINT THOUGH I

04:48:14.910 --> 04:48:15.611

LETTER THAT WE SENT OUT- IT

04:48:22.351 --> 04:48:24.820
BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE-

04:48:24.887 --> 04:48:26.789
DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND WHAT IS

04:48:26.856 --> 04:48:27.823
THE BENEFIT RIGHT IS IT BETTER

04:48:27.890 --> 04:48:29.492
TO HAVE A TEST IN A FACILITY

04:48:29.558 --> 04:48:31.794
THAT HAS LOW EFFICACY- BUT AT

04:48:31.861 --> 04:48:33.763
LEAST YOU HAVE- FASTER

04:48:33.829 --> 04:48:35.231
TURNAROUNDS ALL. OR IS IT

04:48:35.297 --> 04:48:36.699
BETTER TO WAIT RIGHT WELL WE

04:48:36.766 --> 04:48:38.134
OBVIOUSLY WOULD RATHER HAVE THE

04:48:38.200 --> 04:48:39.468
GOLD STANDARD TEST FOR THE

04:48:39.535 --> 04:48:44.340
SHORTER TURNAROUND. TIME

04:55:08.524 --> 04:55:09.792
SOME AREAS THEY'VE KIND OF

04:55:09.858 --> 04:55:10.325

04:55:34.583 --> 04:55:35.150
GOOSEY DEPENDING ON WHAT COUNTY

LABS THAT ARE RUNNING ABOVE AND

04:55:47.496 --> 04:55:51.567

04:59:15.837 --> 04:59:17.272
FRUSTRATING AND THAT'S PART

04:59:17.339 --> 04:59:19.007
THAT'S A BIG PART OF THIS

04:59:19.074 --> 04:59:21.743
TODAY. BECAUSE WE KNOW OUR

04:59:21.810 --> 04:59:24.279
DISTRICTS REALLY WELL AND SO

04:59:24.346 --> 04:59:25.847
THE IDEA THAT E COULD REACH

04:59:25.914 --> 04:59:28.450
OUT TO COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO

HELP AMPLIFY MESSAGES. THAT

04:59:30.719 --> 04:59:32.220
COULD BE HELPFUL. FOR THESE

04:59:32.287 --> 04:59:34.089
KINDS OF THINGS HASN'T HAPPENED

04:59:54.876 --> 04:59:56.144
YOU HAVE POPULATIONS OF FOLKS

04:59:56.211 --> 04:59:58.814
WHO WHO DON'T TRUST A

04:59:58.880 --> 05:00:01.450

05:00:01.516 --> 05:00:03.785
INABILITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO
