00:43:48.726 --> 00:43:51.228
HYDROGEN IS A HIGHLY EN EL

00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:52.963
ENERGETIC MONOCLE MOLECULE THAT

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:58.135
IS NOT ONLY CARBON FREE BUT ALSO

00:43:58.202 --> 00:43:59.937
RENEWABLE.

NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE HAS

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:06.110
BEEN DEVELOPED INTHE U. S. OVER

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:07.511
DECADES OF INVESTMENT AND

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:09.747
COMPLEX PLANNING. TO DEVELOP AN

EQUIVALENT SYSTEM BY HYDROGEN

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.716
WOULD BE EXCESSIVELY EXPENSIVE

00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:14.051
AND NOT REALISTIC WITH CURRENT

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:16.086
MEANS TO PROVIDE HYDROGEN TO

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.988

FORTY MILLION PEOPLE.

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:21.291
HOWEVER PROMISING RESEARCH HAS

00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:23.494
ALSO ALREADY BEEN STARTED AND

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.162
IMPLEMENTED IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN

CONCENTRATIONS OF 20%.

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:34.571
BECAUSE NATURAL GAS

00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:49.239
NOT LOOKING JUST THE COST OF

PRODUCING HYDROGEN BUT THE COST

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.010
IMPLICATIONS FOR RATEPAYERS AS

00:46:53.076 --> 00:46:54.678
MANY OF YOU'VE ALL SEEN PROBABLY

00:46:54.745 --> 00:46:55.879
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS SO

00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:57.247
CAL GAS IS MADE SEVERAL

00:46:57.314 --> 00:46:58.815
ANNOUNCEMENT IT'S ABOUT BECOMING

00:46:58.882 --> 00:46:59.750
THE CLEANEST.

00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:01.218
GAS UTILITY IN THE COUNTRY BY

00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:03.020
PUTTING 20% RENEWABLE NATURAL

00:47:03.086 --> 00:47:05.622
GAS IN THE PIPELINE BY.

00:47:05.689 --> 00:47:06.256
TWENTY THIRTY NOW WE'RE TALKING

00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:07.791
ABOUT 20% HYDROGEN IN THE

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:09.560
PIPELINE BOTH ARE IN G. AND

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:11.962
HYDROGEN ARE EXTREMELY EXTREMELY

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:13.397
EXPENSIVE AND SO THE COST

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:15.098
IMPLICATIONS ON RATE PAYERS NEED

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:16.500
TO BE WELL UNDERSTOOD.

00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:18.435
IT'S NOT SIMPLY ABOUT PUTTING

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:19.603
THIS RENEWABLE GAS INTO THE

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.405
PIPELINE IF IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:23.040
COMPETITIVE FOR OUR LARGE

00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:24.374
AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:26.143
CUSTOMERS SO WE'D LIKE TO GET

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.444
SOME FURTHER AMENDMENTS THAT

00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:29.513
TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE COST

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.148
IMPLICATIONS THANK YOU.

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:31.882
RESPECT THAT.

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:33.283
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE WHO

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:38.555
HAS A IN BETWEEN POSITION OR NO

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:40.123
POSITION ON THIS BILL.

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.991
SEEING NONE WILL TURN TO THE

00:47:41.058 --> 00:47:42.226
COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:44.494
QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:48.465
YES WE ARE MISTER.

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:50.234
THE QUESTION WITH RESPECT -- TO

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.202
THE COST THAT WAS JUST RAISED --

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:54.838
CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT.

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:56.840
A BET I MEAN I I I REPRESENT A

00:47:56.907 --> 00:47:58.609
LOT OF FOLKS THAT.

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:02.346
OUR HI AG ELECTRICITY USERS --

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:04.147
BUTTON.

00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:05.616
HELP HELP US OUT UNDERSTANDING.

00:48:05.682 --> 00:48:07.084
THE COST QUESTION THAT WAS

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.220
RAISED HERE.

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:11.255
SO.

00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:13.190
WE ALSO CARE A LOT ABOUT THE

00:48:13.257 --> 00:48:15.125
COST IF IT IF IT DOESN'T PENCIL

00:48:15.192 --> 00:48:16.526
OUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THEN

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:18.395
IT'S NOT REALLY A VIABLE

00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:21.131
SOLUTION -- ONE OF THE BIG

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:22.466
CHANGE IS HAPPENING IN OUR WORLD

00:48:22.532 --> 00:48:24.167
TODAY AT LEAST IN THE UNITED

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:27.337
STATES IS WE NOT ONLY HAVE A A

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:29.273
GROWING RENEWABLES PORTFOLIO WE

00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:30.374
HAVE EXCESS.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.876
RENEWABLE ENERGY BEING GENERATED

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:35.712
AND THE VISION FOR COST

00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:38.315
EFFECTIVE HYDROGEN REALIZE QUITE

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:40.951
A BIT ON THAT EXCESS RENEWABLE

00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:43.287
PORTFOLIO -- BEING AVAILABLE TO

00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:46.723
GENERATE VERY LOW COST OR FREE.

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:49.092
ENERGY WHEN THE REST OF THE

00:48:49.159 --> 00:48:51.128
GREAT DOESN'T NEED IT.

00:48:51.194 --> 00:48:55.999
I WE SEE THAT AS A BIG PART OF

00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:57.501
THE COST CONTROL COSTS

00:48:57.567 --> 00:48:59.336
MANAGEMENT FOR THE HYGIENE PIECE

00:48:59.403 --> 00:49:00.304
OF THE PUZZLE.

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:02.506
ON FORMER ENERGY SECRETARY CHU

00:49:02.572 --> 00:49:04.041
ACTUALLY AS A PIECE OUT.

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:06.043
TODAY OR YESTERDAY SPEAKING TO

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:10.047
THIS ON A NATIONAL SCALE -- SO I

00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:10.781
THINK CALIFORNIA HAS THE

00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:12.916
OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN THE LEAD ON

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:13.850
THIS IN A MINUTE IN THE UNITED

00:49:13.917 --> 00:49:16.720
STATES BUT OTHERS ACROSS THE

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:17.321
COUNTRY ARE TAKING A GOOD LOOK

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:19.723
AT IT [inaudible]

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.425
TOO OKAY.

00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:22.793
APPRECIATE THAT SO IF THERE ARE

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:25.429
NO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:27.564
WILL HAVE A ROLL CALL ON THEM --

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:29.399
I'M SORRY. FOR YOUR CALL FOR IN

00:49:29.466 --> 00:49:30.767
BETWEEN POSITIONS AND NO

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:31.835
POSITIONS ARE NOT OPPOSITE MY

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:33.837
APOLOGIES NO PROBLEM -- LAUREN

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:35.405
CALLING ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:38.875
CALIFORNIA WE OPPOSE OF A. B. --

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:39.509
FOR NINETY ONE WE BELIEVE THAT

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:40.977
IN ORDER FOR CALIFORNIA TO MEET

00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:42.079
ITS CLIMB AND GREENHOUSEGAS

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:43.647
REDUCTION TARGETS THE STATE MUST

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:45.282
STOP RELYING ON ITS NATURAL GAS

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:46.717
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:48.118
THE IDEA OF USING HYDROGEN AN

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:49.786
EXISTING NATURAL GRASS GRID HAS

00:49:49.853 --> 00:49:51.455
BEEN ANALYZED IN VERY STUDIES

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:52.155
GOING BACK TO THE NINETEEN

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:53.256
EIGHTIES.

00:49:53.323 --> 00:49:54.257
THIS RESEARCH HAS ALREADY

00:49:54.324 --> 00:49:55.559
DISCLOSE THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED

00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:57.060
WITH INJECTING HYDROGEN INTO THE

00:49:57.127 --> 00:49:59.196
PIPELINES HYDROGEN IS A SMALLER

00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:00.997
MOLECULES IN GAS GIVING IT A

00:50:01.064 --> 00:50:02.099
FASTER LEE COULD TRADE IN A MORE

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:03.767
POTENT CORROSIVE EFFECT ON

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:05.001
METALS.

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:05.502
BLENDING HUNDRED AND CAN

EMBRITTLEMENT OF THE PIPING

00:50:12.442 --> 00:50:13.677
LEADS TO A HIGHER RISK OF

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:14.911
DANGEROUS LEAKS.

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:16.246
WE DO NOT WANT TO EXTEND THE

00:50:16.313 --> 00:50:17.514
TIME PERIOD FOR WHICH CALIFORNIA

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:18.882
ITS ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNITIES

00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:22.686
WILL BE SUBJECTED TO PIPELINE

00:50:22.753 --> 00:50:23.620
LEAKS.

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:24.221
AGAIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:50:24.287 --> 00:50:25.021
MUST PHASE OUT THE USE OF

00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:25.589
NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:50:25.655 --> 00:50:27.057
TIME AND EFFORT SHOULD BE SPENT

00:50:27.124 --> 00:50:28.492
ON GETTING US OFF PUTTING GAS

00:50:28.558 --> 00:50:30.293
ENTIRELY WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.728
TRUE CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:33.764

THANK YOU AND WITH THE COMMENTS

00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:47.677
FROM THE SIERRA CLUB I THINK OF

00:50:47.744 --> 00:50:49.212
A GREAT CONCERNED ESPECIALLY

00:50:49.279 --> 00:50:50.680
WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN.

00:50:50.747 --> 00:50:53.049
IS THIS THE THE THE IS A IN

00:50:53.116 --> 00:50:54.451
THEIR STATEMENT THEY TALKED

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:56.019
ABOUT A HIGHER RISK OF CORROSION

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:57.254
AND LEAKS.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.823
CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT CONCERN.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:00.757

00:51:04.127 --> 00:51:06.763
TECHNOLOGY TO DO THE STUDY AND

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:08.131
SO IF THAT'S THE CASE WE'RE NOT.

00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:09.866
IMPLEMENTING ANYTHING THIS IS

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:12.068
JUST PACIFIC LEAD TO GET A STUDY

00:51:12.135 --> 00:51:13.737
TO SEE WHERE WE ARE YES THERE

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:14.805
HAS BEEN OTHER.

00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:17.073
ACCORDING TO WHAT SHE SAID --

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.175
STUDIES ALL THIS STUDY WOULD

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:20.177
GIVE US THAT INFORMATION OF

00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:22.245
CURRENT INFORMATION -- IN REAL

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:23.613
TIME AND SO THIS IS JUST THE

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.982
STUDY AND IF IT DOESN'T BOB.

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:31.121
PENCIL OUT AND IT DOESN'T -- BUT

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:32.923
THIS IS SPECIFICALLY FOR STUDY.

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:35.492
IF IF I MAY UM IF A STUDY HAS

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:36.126
BEEN DONE WOULD YOU WORK WITH

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:37.227
SHARE CLUB TO SEE WHAT THE STUDY

00:51:37.294 --> 00:51:38.495
WITH THE SCOPE OF THAT STUDY WAS.

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:39.930
TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE'S

00:51:39.996 --> 00:51:41.164
SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY CAUSING

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:43.433
A DANGER THAT WE WE STEER AWAY

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.901
FROM THAT -- BECAUSE CERTAINLY

00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:46.770
NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE THESE LEAKS

00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:49.773
IN THEIR COMMUNITY ABSOLUTELY

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.174
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:51.441
THANK YOU.

00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:55.612
OF THIS MESSAGE THANK YOU -- I

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:57.080
HAVE TO ADMIT I DON'T KNOW

00:51:57.147 --> 00:51:58.982
ENOUGH ABOUT.

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:00.317
TO HYDROGEN COULD YOU TALK ABOUT

00:52:00.383 --> 00:52:05.222
HOW HYDROGEN IS -- RENEWABLE.

00:52:05.288 --> 00:52:07.991
SO TODAY -- HYDROGEN IS PRODUCED

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:10.427
IN AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT WAYS --

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:13.530
FROM FOSSIL NATURAL GAS BY YOU

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:15.265
PUT IT THROUGH A PROCESS YOU

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:16.132
MOVE THE CARBON AND YOU'VE GOT

00:52:16.199 --> 00:52:16.867
HODGEN.

00:52:16.933 --> 00:52:19.703
YOU CAN TAKE ANY -- ORGANIC

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:23.073
BASED RENEWABLE GAS FROM A

00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:24.941
GETTING WAY STREAM COULD BE.

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:26.543
ORGANIC MATERIALS COMING OUT OF

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:27.010
URBAN AREAS COULD BE

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:28.411
AGRICULTURAL ORGANIC WASTE

00:52:28.478 --> 00:52:29.980
SIMILAR PROCESS REMOVE THE

00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:31.281
CARBON YOU GOT HIGH JIM LEFT

00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:32.115
OVER.

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:33.917
THE THIRD PROCESS WHICH HAS GOT

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:35.685
A LOT OF ATTENTION RECENTLY IS

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:37.721
WHAT'S CALLED ELECTROLYTIC --

00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:39.322
HYDROGEN WHICH IS BACK TO OUR

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:40.790
HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY CLASS

00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:44.661
WHERE YOU RUN ELECTRIC CURRENT

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:46.630
THROUGH A A JAR OF WATER AND

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:47.531
THAT CREATES OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN.

00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:49.499
YOU CAN DO THAT ON A ON A LARGER

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:50.634
SCALE.

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.168
BACK TO MR PATTERSON'S QUESTION

00:52:52.235 --> 00:52:54.137
ABOUT COST IF YOU'RE ELECTRICITY

00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:57.307
IS VERY LOW COST OR FREE THAT

00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:59.175
PROCESS STARTS TO BECOME.

00:52:59.242 --> 00:53:01.211
MORE AND MORE ECONOMICAL -- SO

00:53:01.278 --> 00:53:02.712
ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE IN PLAY

00:53:02.779 --> 00:53:05.148
TODAY AND WE AS A COMPANY AND AS

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:06.449
A SECTOR.

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:08.351
INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING HODGEN

00:53:08.418 --> 00:53:10.687
THINK THAT ALL THREE SHOULD.

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:13.590
UNDERGO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:15.258
AND ALL THREE ARE EQUALLY AT

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:19.462
THIS POINT COMMERCIALLY VIABLE.

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:22.065
TODAY MOST HYGIENIST PRODUCED

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:25.735
FROM A A FOSSIL GAS BUT IT'S THE

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:27.337
SAME TECHNOLOGY.

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:28.972
AND PROCESS.

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:29.639
FOR PRODUCING IT FROM OUR NOBLE

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:32.976
GAS AND ON THE ELECTROLYTIC IT

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:33.510
IS.

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:36.913
A EARLY IN THE PROCESS OF

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.149
GROWING THAT TO SCALE FOR

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:40.984
COMMERCIAL USE MORE THAN YOU

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:42.118
