THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND IT FIRST I WANT TO SURE THAT YOU CLEAR THAT WE WILL BE X. ALL OF THE MEN OUT IN THE. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB SEVEN NINETY TO A SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR BILL THAT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. THE AUTHOR STAFF CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS COST CONCERNS. THAT WERE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE. AROUND THE WORLD THERE IS A CLEAR PROBLEM WITH WASTEFUL PROP PLASTICS. IF WE CONTINUE TO PRODUCE THE SAME AMOUNT OF NEW PLASTICS THAT WE ARE TODAY. THEN BY TWENTY FIFTY THERE WILL BE MORE PLASTIC IN THE OCEANS THAN FISH. ADDITIONALLY NATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE FOUND THAT THAT MIGHT MAKE IT A PLASTICS WILL COME. COMPROMISED OR COME COMPROMISED 15% OF GHG EMISSIONS. THE SAME AS TRANSPORTATION TODAY. THERE'S A CLEAR NEED TO ACTUALLY RECYCLE PLASTICS IN THE STATE AND NOT JUST SHIP IT TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. SETTING UP A MINIMUM CONTENT STANDARD. WAS IN ALL OF IT WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT THE ENVIRONMENT BY PRODUCING LESS NEW PLASTIC. IT WILL RESULT IN LESS PLASTIC BEING DUMPED IN LANDFILLS AND BENEFIT CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING MARKET A FEW KEY WITNESSES TO THIS MORNING MISTER CHAIR MARK MURRAY CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. AND PETER. DAVIS WALLY NESTLE. WATERS OF NORTH AMERICA. OKAY ARE THEY PRESS ON THE PHONE LINES BECAUSE I GUESS THERE'S I THINK MARKET PETER JUST JUST JOINT OKAY FANTASTIC SO LET'S. LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES AND WE'LL HEAR WE'LL HEAR FROM THEM SO THEY CAN PRESENT- THEIR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL THIS IS MARK MURRAY AND PETER TO POSSIBLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS IS MARK MURRAY WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN NINETY THREE AND ARE CONTINUING TO WORKWITH THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO ENSURE THAT WE GET A GOVERNOR SIGNATURE ON THE MEASURE. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE EFFORTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIANG AND- THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND STAFF AND BRINGING THIS MEASURE- THIS CRITICAL MEASURE AT A TIME WHEN YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL KIND OF FACING OTHER COMPLICATIONS I ALSO DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE VISION OF CENTER WHITE HOUSE SKI WHO INITIALLY PROPOSED A SIMILAR MEASURE TWO YEARS AGO. NOW THERE ARE MANY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR MATERIAL RECYCLING. BUT THE GREATEST BENEFIT MAY BE THE DISPLACEMENT OF EXTRACTED VIRGIN RAW MATERIALS. AS THE SOURCE OF PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING WITH RECYCLED MATERIAL. THIS CLOSED LOOP RECYCLING MEANS THAT WE REDUCE AND EVEN AND WILL ELIMINATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY MATERIAL EXTRACTION AND PROCESSING. CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE NATION IN REQUIRING RECYCLE CONTENT IN PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS WITH THE NATION'S FIRST RECYCLED CONTENT REQUIREMENTS ON PAPER AND GLASS MORE THAN A DECADE AGO. AND WITH THIS MEASURE CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD AGAIN. BOB NOW WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF MANY OF THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY WITH THE CURRENT PROPOSAL BUT LET ME SPEAK TO THOSE IN THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY THAT STILL MAY BE RELUCTANT SUPPORT. NUMBER ONE WE HAVE EXAMPLES IN THE MARKETPLACE TODAY 1100% RECYCLED CONTENT. PLASTIC BEVERAGE PACKAGING THIS IS TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE. NUMBER TWO THE PRICE OF PREMIUM RECYCLED FEEDSTOCK TODAY. IS LOWER THAN THE PRICE YOU'RE PAYING FOR PREMIUM VIRGIN SPEECH BUT STOCK. JUST FIVE YEARS AGO CLOSED LOOP RECYCLING WILL NOT COST YOU MORE. AND FINALLY YOU KNOW THERE'VE BEEN CALLS BY SOME BANNING SUCH PIECES OF PLASTIC PACKAGING. INCLUDING PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. HOWEVER SCIENCE DEMONSTRATED. PT PLASTIC BOTTLE THAT IS RECYCLED AND EIGHTY PERCENT. OR BETTER RATE. IT IS MADE WITH 50% OR MORE RECYCLED CONTENT MAY HAVE THE LOWEST ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT OF. ANY COMPETING MATERIAL TYPE. THE IN S. B. IN AB SEVEN NINETY THREE REPRESENT A CRITIC BEST. AND REALLY AN OPERA FOR THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY TO REALIZE PACKAGING SUSTAINABILITY. AS THIS MEASURE MOVES FORWARD IT'S NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY TO DRAG THEIR FEET ON A PATH TO FIFTY PERCENT. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MARK- WILL NEXT HEAR FROM PETER THE BEST QUALITY FROM. NESTLE WATERS NORTH AMERICA. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I NEED TO SPEAK ABOUT SCHOOL ON THE VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR NESTLE WATERS NORTH AMERICA WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY THREE.

HAVE DEMONSTRATED. INTO LEADERSHIP IN IT YOU. IN THE WAITING ROOM FOR CONTENT HI. IS CRITICAL FOR THIS ECONOMY WE AREN'T AVAILABLE ACROSS THE US IS HERE CAL. BECAUSE MANY AUTHORS AND STAFF TO WORKING FASHION STRAW MEASURE I WILL HAVE TO FIGURE IMPACT CALIFORNIA GLOBAL LEADER IN RECYCLED CONTENT. LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS WE HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS TO INCREASE THE USE OF RECYCLED CONTENT THROUGHOUT OUR. OWN PORTFOLIO. ALL THESE COMPANIES TO CHEAT KERN COMMIT TO CONTINUE MAKING YOU. THIRTY BE ON WILL OFTEN. FIVE GRADE CONTENT WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY HISTORIC INTEREST THAT CAL. INCREASE SUPPLY. THE MORNING THEN IN COLLECTION. IS NEEDED. WE BELIEVE IN PATIENT IN A BIG THIRTEEN OF ALMOST LIKE A- CANADA CAL. WILL SOLIDIFY CAN. THEREBY STIMULATING THE NOT FURTHERING. TO INCREASE WE- FIVE. THE STAFF WAS SEEN RECYCLED STANDARD LIKE THE ONE EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY THREE WILL ALSO WE ALIGN AND MARKET USE SO THAT MORE FOOD GRADE RECYCLED CONTENT. IS RECYCLED BACK INTO FOOD GRADE APPLICATIONS. THE STATE EXPERIENCE DRAKEN RECLAIMS BEVERAGE CONTAINERS DURING THE PANDEMIC. IN RECOGNITION OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HAD THE BILL PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE MINIMUM CONTENT STANDARD SHOULD BE ADJUSTED. WELCOME SAME TIME IT CONTAINS STRONG ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS FOR NON COMPLIANCE WITH FOUR TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT POLICIES LIKE EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHT THREE. PROMOTED GREATER USE OF RECYCLED CONTENT BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. THANK YOU SHERMAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT PETER.

AND SO I WANTI JUST TWO ONE APPRECIATE THAT THE HARD WORK OF THE AUTHOR AND THE SUPPORTERS AND ALL THE INDUSTRY FOLKS AS WELL CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS TO MAKE TO BRING TO TENTATIVE TO EFFECTUATE THIS COMPROMISE SO. LET'S NOW. OPEN IT UP TO DISCUSSION. FROM OUR MEMBERS- I LIKE TO RECOGNIZE. OUR CHAIR EMERITUS SENATOR BOB KASKI MISTER. AND CHAIR THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT THE NARROW DEFINITION OF BOTTLE GRADE WHICH PREVIOUSLY IS NOT BEEN IN STATUTE HE THEN THEY THINK GOES ON TO THE AVAILABILITY OF PLASTICS AND I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD HAVE A CLARIFICATION ON HOW WE'RE- THE AMENDMENTS LANDED ON JUST APOLLO CREED DEFINITION. THAT MAY HAVE BEEN TOO NARROW AND DIDN'T INCLUDE. A LOT OF POTENTIALLY RECYCLABLE PLASTIC IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME FROM REPORT. I THANK YOU OKAY THIS IS A IT'S A COMMITTEE MAY WISH TO HAVE CONSIDER SUPPLYING DEMAND POST CONSUMER RECYCLING PLASTICS COLLECTION. BATES AND BAIL AVAILABILITY DOMESTICALLY AND GLOBALLY BUT THE DEFINITION OF BILE. OF BOTTLE CREEK WAS NARAL ON WHAT IS IN THE UNIVERSE RIGHT WHEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND ID. IT IS ONE THING SO I GUESS I WANTED TO BE. SURE ARE WE STILL USING BIO OR BOTTLE GRADE AS A DEFINITION IN THIS IN THE FINAL AMENDMENTS AND IF WE ARE HOW IS THAT I DON'T HAVE A COPY OF THE AMENDMENTS I APOLOGIZE. MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE PASSWORD THINGS ARE SO TOUGH HERE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW THAT THE KEEP THE STAFFER WHO WORKS ON THIS IS. SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE FIRST VOTE THE CONSIDERATION BY CAL RECYCLE. THIRD THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE AVAILABILITY OF PLASTIC. PLUS SIX WHAT GOES INTO CLAM SHELLS WHAT GOES INTO THIS WHAT'S THE MARKET CONDITIONS AND ALL THAT TYPE OF STUFF BUT ON THE FRONT END WE'RE SAYING WHAT HIS BOTTLE GRADE WHAT IS NOT BOTTLE GRADE. VERSUS SEEING THE PET OR SOME OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS. FOR A YEAH NO I YOUR POINTS WELL TAKEN PRISON THE BULLY SIX EXPAND THE UNIVERSE WHICH IS I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE STILL STOP I GUESS QUESTION WOULD BE. ARE WE STILL USING THAT. NEW DEFINITION THAT'S NEVER BEEN USED BEFORE AND WHAT VITAL GREED IS IN AND TRYING TO EXPAND THE MARKET SEN AND THE AVAILABILITY LOOK AT THESE OTHER CRITERIA IN ORDER TO GET. THE RECYCLABLE. THE INCLUSION OF MATERIAL TO REACH THE 50% GOAL BY TWENTY THIRTY RIGHT THOUGH THOUGH THOUGH I'M- EUROPE SEE RIGHT THOUGH THOUGH IF YOU NOTICE AND THE MORE EXPLICITLY REQUIRING COVERS LIKE- TO CONSIDER PLASTIC GLOBALLY NOT JUST BASED ON BOTTLE GRADE. SO I'M FRED SMITH RICHARD THAT GOES TO WE CAN IMPORT SOMEBODY ELSE'S PLASTIC AND WE CAN BE THE NEW CHINA TAILORED TO MAKE A 50% GRADE OR WE CAN WORK WITHIN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT. MORE OF THE- CHEERLESS BEING USE HOW WE DEFINE BOTTLE GRADE IS. INCLUSIVE NASA AND THAT WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR OUR DOMESTIC MARKET I MEAN I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THESE RIGHT B. CALIFORNIA JOBS IN THE CALIFORNIA CIRCULAR ECONOMY DID SAYING- WE HIT THE SITES THE- BUT WE HAVE THE- CONSTRICTING. DEFINITION SO WE'RE IMPORTING PLASTIC FROM QUAM VIRGIN ISLANDS AND ALL THESE OTHER EXOTIC PLACES DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE VALUABLE TO PUT IN SOME LANGUAGE ABOUT YOU KNOW WANTING TO GIVE RELEASE WE HAVE TO RUN THIS BY THE LAWYERS OF COURSE BUT- YOU KNOW WITH THE MIND TOWARD. YEAH IN IN IN STATE PRODUCTION HE IT COULD BE I MEAN IF THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO FIFTY STATES THE DISTRICT STATES TO BE FIFTY GROUPS THAT WOULD COME. UP WITH DIFFERENT. DEFINITIONS OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE FOR. BOTTOM CREATED IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO. TO FLOATED TO NINE THIRTY INTEGRITY THE BILLS IN. THE BOTTLES IN THE INTEGRITY OF. THE HEALTH AND ALL THAT TYPE OF STUFF BUT DON'T BE TOO. RESTRICTIVE SAID THAT. WE'RE ONLY USING. THIS NEW CLASS OF PLASTICS WHICH COULD YOU KNOW WE WANT TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN I THINK THAT SORT OF AT THE END OF THE DAY. MAYBE MISTER HILL COULD YES IT LOOKS LIKE OUR OF ALL THE JACQUI- WOULD LIKE TO. LIKE TO RESPOND. IN CENTER WHITE HOUSE HE RAISES A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND THAT THE AUTHOR HAS A- IS WAS PLANNING TO REALLY ADDRESS THE BOTTLE GRADE DEFINITION AND- IN APPROPRIATIONS WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE. PLACED OKAY SO. IT'S NOT DONE YET. MISTER HILL AND I WHO SERVE ON THE APPROPRIATIONS FULL I CONSIDER THIS ON MONDAY I GUESS. MORE WEDNESDAY WHATEVER IT IS THANK YOU NUMBER QUESTIONS ALL MOVED THE BILL. APPRECIATE THAT BUT I WILL SAY I AM ABSOLUTELY. HAPPY FOR OUR- FOR OUR TEAMS IN CENTER HILLS TEAM YOUR TEAM OURS THE COMMITTEE. I THE AUTHOR TO SIT DOWN AND SEE IF THERE WOULD BE SOME SORT OF WINNING TEAM. WINNING YOU KNOW SO SOME SOME SORT OF LANGUAGE HERE THAT MIGHT MIGHT HELP TO RESOLVE SOME OF YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR CONCERNS. SENATE ALI. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MY OWN CARE YES YOUR BEGINNER THANK YOU. SO I JUST WANT TO THE SPRINGBOARD MAYBE OFF OF THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE I HAVE THE SAME LOOK THE REASON YOU HAVE COUPLE CONCERNS EVERYONE IS THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS WILL MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION ON THE BILL AND I THINK WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET. TO A PLACE WHERE. YOU GOOD SOUND RECYCLING WE HAVE NON CONTAMINATED THE PROBLEM WITH. RECYCLING IS YOU HAVE TO. PACIFY IT SO IT'S NOT CONTAMINATED YOU CAN REUSE. IT INTO AN APPROPRIATE MANNER. WITH THAT BEING SAID WE IN RECENT THE INFORMATION I HAVE YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN MANY COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT TAKING OURS WASTE BECAUSE IT'S CONTAMINATED THEY CAN'T REALLY YOU RIGHT LIKE THEY WANT SO THAT THERE'S A IT'S A GLOBAL PROBLEMS SOMETHING THAT. MAIN TO CALIFORNIA EVEN THOUGH WE ARE. FOCUSING ON. YOU KNOW 10% BY TWENTY TWENTY TO. 25% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THEN. FIFTY BUT I THINK IT'S 50% BY. BY TWENTY THIRTY. SO I THINK THE CHALLENGE HERE IS TO DETERMINE WHAT IS THAT WHAT'S THE AMOUNT WELL I MEAN WE DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE WE WE'VE BEEN THROWING IT ALL INTO ONE GIANT RECYCLING. OF BIN I GUESS AND THEN WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THAT QUALITY THAT IS AVAILABLE TO. RE USE IN A SAFE MANNER- AND I THINK THAT'S THE GOAL HERE SO. FOR ME I'M I'M- I'M THINKING THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE MOVING RIGHT ALONG RIGHT PASSED WE GOT TO DETERMINE THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD THESE. COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE PERCENTAGES AND MAYBE THAT AMOUNT IS NOT AVAILABLE. OR MAYBE IT IS WE DON'T KNOW MAYBE THERE ARE SOME TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE SO I GUESS. THERE THE CONVERSATION IS I IN THIS IS TOO BAD THAT THE AUTHORSNOT HERE BUT I'M ASSUMING THERE'S FACED WITH THE SAME ISSUE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. TO OUR HALLWAY OFF THE BILL- AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN APPROACH BUT I MAYBE WITH MAYBE WE CAN GET SOME ANSWERS BETWEEN NOW AND APPROPRIATIONS. ON YOU KNOW HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. BECAUSE THAT'S THE KEY IS THAT IF WE CAN'T FIND THE MATERIAL. MORGAN WE HOLD THESE. THESE WE WANT TO FIRST OF ALL THE GOAL IS TO RECYCLE BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT A SAFE MANNER SO. I KIND OF I JUST WENT THROUGH HERE AND TRY TO FIND THAT INFORMATION WHEN I WAS READING AND I DIDN'T FIND THAT INFORMATION ON. HOW E GET THERE. SO THAT'S MY QUESTION IS. ARE THE COMPANY'S GONNA BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. TO THOSE PERCENTAGES IF THE MATERIAL IS NOT AVAILABLE. SENATE HEALTHCARE OF MR MURRAY'S I BELIEVE STILL ON THE LINE OUR PRIMARY WITNESS AND I THINK HE COULD MAYBE CLARIFY SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND ENSURE. LET'S GO LET'S TURN TO YOU AYE MR MURRAY IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF SENATE DOLLARS CONCERNS MAYBE CAN ALSO COMMENTED SOME OF CINEMA CASKETS CONCERNS AS WELL. CERTAINLY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND- I WOULD JUST SIMPLY NOTE THAT- TWO YEARS AGO THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY DID RAISE. SUCH ACTION TO CENTER WHITE HOUSE HE'S BILL AND I UNDERSTAND WHY HE MAY HAVE THIS CONCERN. BUT TODAY WE HAVE THE BEST RECLAIMER IS IN THE COUNTRY YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA. SO CALIFORNIA BEVERAGE CONTAINERS ARE SEGREGATED FROM THE REST OF PLASTIC AND THEY GO TO. A HALF A DOZEN DIFFERENT RECLAIMER IS THERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO PROCESS JUST A SINGLE MATERIAL P. E. T. PACKAGING. AND THEY ARE PRODUCING TODAY. WITH THAT MATERIAL WITH RECYCLED MATERIAL BEVERAGE PACKAGING AND OTHER FOOD PACKAGING FOOD GRADE PACKAGING BEVERAGE GET GREAT PACKAGING. I THINK THIS TERM- BEVERAGE GREAT MATERIAL- IS A HOLDOVER FROM PREVIOUS BEVERAGE INDUSTRY CONCERNS. AND WE HOPE TO CLARIFY THAT IN THE APPROPRIATIONS AMENDMENTS. BUT KNOW THAT YOU HAVE PROPERLY. EITHER RECLAIMING CONTEST IN CALIFORNIA. EIGHT TEN. QUITE OF THE TERMS OF PRODUCING FOOD QUALITY RECYCLED. PLASTIC PACKAGING FOR THERMAL. PACKAGING WE CAN DO THAT TODAY THE PROBLEM IS DON'T HAVE THE SUPPLY. WE NEED TO INCREASE RISK RATES AS MR. FROM WAS REFERENCING. RIGHT AND IF I UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT- THE BILL ACTUALLY GIVES CAL RECYCLE QUITE A BIT OF FLEXIBILITY- POWER CYCLE IS ULTIMATELY SUPPOSED TO YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE SUPPLY PLASTIC WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ADJUST THE MINIMUM SECOND CONTENT. STANDARDS SO IT YOU KNOW THERE'S EXACTLY MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS IS A SUBJECTIVE THIS IS ALL SUBJECTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAL RECYCLE TO- INFORM IF BEVERAGE OR OTHERS WERE TO RAISE CAN. ABOUT WHY OF SEDITION QUALITY. RECYCLE WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO CONSIDER THAT BUT THIS ISN'T SOME KIND OF HARD AND FAST RULE AND KNOW THAT WE HAVE AGAIN THIS IS EXCELLENT RECLAIMING. AFTER HEARING CALIFORNIA THAT IS PROCESSING CALIFORNIA GENERATED MATERIAL IN CAMBRIDGE. SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF CALIFORNIA GENERATED MATERIALS FOR CALIFORNIA. FOOD AND BEVERAGE PACKAGERS. IS THAT DOES THAT. MASON CENTER I. YEAH MY MOST ALONE THANK YOU OF COURSE I. YEAH THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL- I GUESS THE GRILL QUESTION IS THERE ARE THEY GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF THAT IF WE DON'T PRODUCE THAT MATERIAL. IF THE MATERIAL IS NOT AVAILABLE. THAT I THINK I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN AND I WORK WITH THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT NEW OBVIOUSLY ALL OF US IN THIS. ROOM HERE. HAVE WORKED ON THIS IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. SO I. MIKE IS. THIS LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO ME- PERCENTAGE. IF THE MATERIAL IS NOT AVAILABLE NO BE IMPORTING THIS STUFF FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT IF THAT'S THE CASE. YEAH IF YOU LOOK AT THEM I THINK IT'S PAGE SIX REBEL ATTACKS ABOUT HOW. POWER CYCLE IS ABLE TO DECREASE THE MINIMUM CONTENT REQUIREMENTS BASED ON CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS. ARE RECYCLING RATES- AVAILABILITY OF RECYCLED PLASTICS SUITABLE TO MEET THE MINIMUM CONTENT STANDARDS. IT'S ADDRESS SO- THOSE ARE IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE SIX OF THE BILL. THE TALKS ABOUT. JUST WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I I'M I WOULD OF COURSE MEAN BE. TO I WAS JUST LIKE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. IT ON ON THE P. FAST ALL RIGHT YOU YOU KNOW YOU YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE IF YOU'RE GONNA. YOU KNOW A FORCE A CHANGE SO. THIS IS THIS THERE THERE IS. WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT COVERS LIKE WILL BE LOOKING AT ALL THE MARKET FACTORS IN MAKING CHANGES. AND TWEAKS BASED ON THOSE REALITIES. ETCETERA CASKET. MISTER CHARACTER BEEN DOES WHO HAVE ARGUED THAT IF YOU. IMPLEMENTED AN EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND MOVE. ALL THE PLASTIC DRINK BOTTLES ALL THE CLASS NOBODY. OUT OF REACH. AND SEGREGATE THEM IN HAD A OF TWO CENTS INSTEAD A NICKEL HE THE 50% GOAL WOULD BE CAKE BECAUSE THEN ARE RECYCLERS WOULD BE DOING THAT THEY'D HAVE THAT SEGREGATED NUMBER ONE PETE BUT IN ALL THE TWO THREES FOURS AND FIVES WILL BE WITH. TRADITIONAL NERFS WOULD BE DEALING WITH BUT THAT'S NOT BEFORE US RIGHT NOW BUT THIS IS THE CONTENT LEVEL. I YEAH I THINK YOU HAVE- YOU HAD A BILL ON THAT VERY TOPIC. NEXT YEAR VERY. ALL RIGHT. YEAH RUSSIAN I WANT TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THE PRESENCE OF OUR GOOD FRIEND SENATOR SKINNER WHO IS HERE- WE ARE CURRENTLY DEBATING AB SEVENTY THREE SENATOR- IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND TO SAY HELLO AND ALSO IDENTIFYING ANY STOCK YOU MIGHT HAVE WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE IF THEY'RE THEY'RE- CERTAINLY- YES HERE I AM PARTICIPATING REMOTELY IN THE COMMITTEE AND MY STAFF THAT'S WITH ME IS A MARKER PANELING GREEDY OKAY FANTASTIC IN YOUR YOUR DISTRICT OFFICE.

A CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ITEM NUMBER ONE AB SEVEN NINE THREE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ALLEN HI ALLEN AYE BATES HI BATES I DALLY BY DALLY I HILL HI HILL AYE SKINNER. SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE STERN. BY CASCADE BY MY CASKEY I'D SIX ZERO OKAY SIX ZERO WILL HOLD THAT ROLE OPEN FOR CENTER STERN TO ADD ON WHEN HE'S READY AND THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR. THE ROBUST DISCUSSION. ALRIGHT LET'S NOW GO TO A CENTER MULLINS BILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER MONTHS BILL IT'S AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY ONE THIS IS. REALLY NICE OPR ONE OF SEVERAL CASKETS FAVORITE. FAVORITE BRANCHES THE GOVERNMENT SAID ORTEZ HE'S GOING TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY ONE YEAH MISTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES AND I'LL DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE STAFF REPORT BY MISTER WALTERS THE POINTS OUT WITH THE ESTABLISHING OF OPR TO HAVE ONE AGENCY AT THE STATE LEVEL WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING DEVELOPING STATE LAND USE POLICIES COORDINATING PLANNING IS PLANNING OF ALL STATE AGENCIES ASSISTING A MONITORING. LOCAL AND REGIONAL THE PLANNING SO THIS IS ON POINT I'VE DONE SOME WORK IN THIS AREA MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER pCOMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE ANALYSIS. AND HITS HE'S ACCEPTING COMMITTEE OF COMMITMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE REPORT. MEMBERS WE ALL KNOW ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND IT'S HARD TO PROJECT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BUT CURRENT AND PROJECTED IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDE. EVERYTHING FROM SEA LEVEL RISE TO SEVERE DROUGHT THESE IMPACTS CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH SAFETY. ECOSYSTEM INTEGRITY AND THE DELIVERY OF BASIC SERVICES VERY- VERY BASED ON THE COMMUNITIES FISCAL AND SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS SO THIS IS A REGIONAL. THIS MAKES REGIONAL COORDINATION BETWEEN LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFITS PRIVATESECTORS. IN ENTITIES. A VITAL COMPONENT A RESILIENCY PLANNING SOUTH WE HAVE. WE TALKED ABOUT- THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT SOME LOCAL AND REGIONAL AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE BEGIN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING FOR THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE PROVIDED SOME MONEY IN THE STATE BUDGET NOT A LOT OF MONEY BUT SPARINGLY EACH YEAR WE TRY TO GIVE SOME MONEY TO WHETHER TO BE CDC IN THE BAY AREA OR THEIR- CULTURAL COMMISSION TO DO SOME PLAIN TO HELP WITH THE- WITH OUR AGE- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. PREPARE PLAN AND WORK WITH THEIR JASON ENTITIES IN THE REGION SO COME UP WITH SOME REGIONAL PLANNING AND SOME OF THIS IS HAPPENING ORGANICALLY WHETHER YOU'RE- A- FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICTS OTHER ASSOCIATIONS TO GET TOGETHER AND THEY- THEY TRY TO WORK. COURTENEY INSTEAD ACROSS COUNTIES AND TRIED TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE REGION. BUT WE DON'T HAVE A IN STATUTE OF COORDINATED PLAN IN THE STATE'S CURRENT MECHANISM FOR FUNDING IT IS ADMITTEDLY PIECEMEAL DEPENDING ON WHAT WE GET IN THE BUDGET. AND THE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY THIS WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS ARE MADE THE MOST EFFECTIVELY. AND RESILIENCY IS OPTIMIZED SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES TO SIX TO FILL THE GAP. BY DEVELOPING GUIDANCE FOR PER STATE FEDERAL PRIVATE INVESTMENT. IN FUNDING REGIONAL PRIORITY ADAPTATION PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE AND ENCOURAGE LOCAL REGIONAL ENTITIES TO. COLLABORATE WHEN PLANNING FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND WAY TO PROMOTES REGIONAL SOLUTIONS AND- IMPROVES THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCIES FOR ADAPTATION PLANNING THIS IS. OUR HAS DONE SOME WORK THE- DAY CLIMATE. COLLABORATIVES HAVE SPRUNG UP AT DIFFERENT LEVELS FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ENTHUSIASM AND I WILL COMMENT THIS HAS BEEN LED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL AND WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING AND THIS IS SORT OF TYING IT ALL UP IN THE STATUTE SO WE HAVE MAKE ARNOLD WITH VALLEY VISION AND BRUCE WRITTEN WITH THE BAY AREA CLIMATE ADAPTATION NETWORK. AND AYE URGING AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S HEAR FROM YOUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MAKE AND BRUCE.

WHICH IS A COALITION OF SEVEN DIVERS VOLUNTARY URBAN AND RURAL NETWORK OF COMMUNITY LEADERS AND PRIVATE PRACTITIONERS. WHICH ALL WORK YOU CREATED IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE ADAPTATION STRATEGIES TO BUILD REGIONAL RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE IMPACTS. TODAY BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE IN ALL OF THIS AND ON BEHALF OF VALUATION AND MYSELF. WITHOUT DOUBT THE MOST SCALE FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION WORK IS REGIONAL AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL COLLISIONS ARE ABLE TO FAN JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES AS THEY MUST DO. WHILE ALSO RESPONDING TO REGIONAL CLIMATE RISK AS THEY OFTEN DO. IF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CHALLENGES NOW FACING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL GREATLY THREATEN THEIR ABILITY TO CONDUCT ITS POTENTIAL PLANNING. AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY ONE WILL CREATE A DURABLE FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVE ADAPTATION PLANNING AND ACTION. IT WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT NECESSARY FUTURE OR COUNTY ALEX IN THAT. THE CENTRAL. AND THAT BURST NATURE'S OF OUR REGION. BASICALLY WE THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE FRAMEWORK HELPS THAT THE COURT THREE LEGS OF THE STOOL IS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL REGIONAL ADAPTATION WORK. FIRST LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAPACITY INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL PLANNING ENTITIES TO CONDUCT ITS POTENTIAL MULTI AGENCY AND MULTI JURISDICTION COLLABORATION. SECOND REGIONAL NETWORKS SUPPORTING AFRICAN DIVERSE LOCAL AND REGIONAL NETWORK HOLDERS TO PROVIDE ACCESS INCLUSION TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO ANY REGIONAL ADAPTATION PLANNING PROCESS. AND THIRTY TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC CLIMATE SERVICES. ACCORDING TO NEED FOR OR LOCALLY APPROPRIATE LEVEL A TECHNICAL AND APPLIED. SCIENCE ADVICE FOR ADAPTATION THANK.

IT WE CAN I CAN'T AFFORD IS TO SIT TIGHT WELL THE CLIMATE CRISIS HITS US EVEN IF WE'RE DEALING WITH COLLUDED TO SAME TIME SO I DO APPRECIATE THE URGENCY OF GETTING THESE PLANNING EFFORTS GOING. I'M TRYING TO TRYING TO GET ASSISTANCE YOU JUST DON'T LIKE WHAT THE WORK PRODUCT ITSELF IS GONNA LOOK LIKE ADDED THESE COLLABORATIVES AND HOW YOU SEE THAT FITTING BACK INTO. THE TOOLS THAT PR'S DEVELOPING WITH THE- N. AND C. N. R. A. OR WITH THE CLIMATE ASSESSMENT AND THE SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA PLAN LIKE HOW DO YOU SEE IT ALL KINDA. FITTING TOGETHER IF YOU WILL OKAY AND WHILE THE- AUTHOR WHAT WHILE CENTER CASKEY MODELS THAT QUESTION YOU NEED WE NEED INTRODUCED JEREMY OF FORMERLY. YES SO SENATOR HENRY STERN HERE MY DISTRICT OFFICE HERE AT MY DISTRICT DIRECTOR JEREMY WOLFE THANK YOU FOR THE SENATE STERN OKAY ONE EGG WILL HANDED OVER TO THE CINEMA CASKEY TO. ATTACK OUR FURNACE WITH THAT IDENTIFICATION OF THE DISTRICT STAFF ON. READY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THROUGH THE CHAIR. HI I THINK. STILL IS IT IS I SEE IT IN YOUR FAMILIAR WITH THE FUNDING CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE SENATE- THE BUDGET COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW THERE'S A- IN EQUILIBRIUM NOT AN EQUILIBRIUM IN THE DIFFERENT COLLABORATORS AND HOW THEY'RE WORKING SUMMER DOING A VERY GOOD JOB OF. GETTING SOME OF THE PLANNING MONEY OUT. SOME OF THEM ARE NOT SO I THINK AT THE FIRST TRANCHE IS GOING TO BE IDENTIFYING HELPING THE LOCALITIES THAT ARE READY TO DO THAT THE PLANNING AND WORK IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY. AND JUST THE PLANNING DOLLARS- I THINK THE OTHER THING IS SOME PEOPLE HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM SO THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SOME OF THEM JUST NEED THE- THE I KNOW IN THE BAY AREA WE HAVE BC DC THIS SORT OF. I WANT A COOKIE CUTTER BUT THEY HAVE THESE THAT. I HAVE IDENTIFIED NEEDS TO GO THROUGH THE PLANNING PROCESS TO TAKE. THEIR ADDRESSED SVERAL ISSUES WHETHER ITS- FIRES DROUGHT SEA LEVEL RISE YEAH THE DATA DATA SO I THINK THE FIRST I CAN'T PROTECT ME THEY'RE GONNA COME UP WITH. THEY'RE GONNA BE TASKED WITH THE WITH THIS BUT I THINK THE FIRST TRANCHE IS GOING TO BE. ON THE PLANNING AND SORT OF GETTING SOME EQUILIBRIUM ON THE ONES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT BEHIND. VERSUS THE ONES THAT AREN'T. WITH THAT SAID NO SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE COLLABORATIVES ARE AT THAT. POINT WHERE THEY CAN IMPLEMENT SOME THINGS AND THEY WANT TO THEY WANT DAVID IDENTIFIED WITH THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY WANT TO GET SOME INFORMATION DOLLARS AND THAT'S GOING TO BE. PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS WHEN THEY COME WITH US AND THEY SAY. WHAT YOU GONNA DO I MEAN. BY WILL. RECALL FOR. THE GOOD SENATOR SHOULD RECALL. THE PARIS CLIMATE CONFERENCE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHICH WAS FIVE YEARS AGO AT THAT TIME THE WORLD COMMITTED SEVENTY PER. 17% OF THEIR DOLLARS THE CLIMATE ADAPTATION. YEAH WE PUT A 100% INTIMIDATION SO WE'RE A LITTLE BIT. NO WE'VE GOTTEN DRIBBLES AND TRAVELS OF IT SO THIS IS A FORMALIZATION OF THAT. I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA GET TO SEVENTEEN PERCENT- YOU KNOW IT BUT THAT'S- BUT THAT'S- SEEMS TO BE WHAT THE GOAL IS AND I WOULD IMAGINE SOME OF THE ADVOCATES WOULD SAY. MAKE IT HAPPEN GIVE A 70% OF CAP AND TRADE FOR. CLIMATE ADAPTATION TO BE GREAT SO THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST. IMMEDIATE MACINNES SAID AND BEING ABLE TO. IDEAS INTEGRATED REGIONAL PROPOSALS THAN TO HAVE THE STATE DO SOME BACKSTOPPING AT LEAST GET SOME SOMETHING MOVING BECAUSE I KNOW. A LOT OF THE COUNTIES ARE NOW STEPPING UP TO. TAX THEMSELVES ARE TRYING TO BOND THEMSELVES. BUT JUST ASSUME THAT ALL THIS CAN BE SOLVED THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK MISSES THE- MISSES THE MARK ON THE SALE OF THE PROBLEM SO. I'M NOT AS YET HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL IN APPRECIATE YOU BRING AFFORD AND- LOOK FOR TO. TRY TO GET A REALLY GOOD INTEGRATED PRO SO THAT. LOCALS ARE MOVING AT THE SAME TIME THE STATE'S GET READY AND WE GET. HOPEFULLY LIKE YOU SAID SOME ACTUAL DOLLARS COMMITTED THIS WAY MISTER CHAIR I KNOW THAT A- HILL HIS WILL BE A BENEFICIARY DISCERNS A PROJECT GOING ON RIGHT NOW ON THE ALAMEDA CREEK. IN THE BAY AREA IT'S THE LARGEST RIVER THAT GOES INTO SAN FRANCISCO BAY AND IT'S BASICALLY. REWORKING THE WEAPON THE RIVER SO YOU TAKE OUT THE CEMENT AND YOU LET THE- THE SOIL. SPREAD OUT TO THE REST OF THE BAY THE ANTICIPATED BIOLOGICAL WORK IS AT ONCE THAT'S COMPLETED THAT'S GOING TO HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF COMPROMISING FOR ONE FOOT OF SEA LEVEL RISE AND THERE'S SOME AREAS IN FOSTER CITY OR EAST PALO ALTO THEY ARE IN. THE LOCALE OF ALAMEDA CREEK BUT THAT WOULD SET DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO WILL BENEFIT AND THE AIRPORT IF YOU IF YOUACTUALLY MITIGATE FOR THAT AND THAT IS ONE OF THESE. PIECES OF WORK THAT'S GOING ON SIMULTANEOUSLY THE PLAN AND THEY JUST HAPPEN TO BE A HEAD ON THE PLANET SOME MORE ACTIVELY SOME MONEY CAME IN FROM THE CITY CALIFORNIA FROM I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.

I AM NUMBER FOUR. A TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLEN BY ALLEN AYE BATES. HI NOT BUILDING BATES NOT VOTING. DALLY NOT VERY DALLY NOT VOTING HILL BY HILL HI SKINNER. SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE STERN. STERN AYE STERN HI MY COUNTY LINE. BURKE OWSKI I'D- GOOD JOB OKAY FIVE ZERO FIVE ZERO CLOSE THE ROLE ON AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE. LET'S NOW GO TO ITEM FIVE. THIS IS SERRA RIVAS IS AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY FOUR. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS LIKE TO THINK THAT SHARING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR- OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON. PLEASE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWO NINE FIVE FOUR. LEGISLATION THAT WOULD DIRECT THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO INCORPORATE AND SET IN OVERALL CLIMATE GOAL FOR OUR STATE'S NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. NATURAL ECONOMIC PRIZE OVER 90% OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE INCREDIBLE LANDSCAPE. THIS INCLUDES FORESTS RANGELANDS FARMS WETLANDS AND MORE. AND THESE LANDS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SEQUESTER. SIGNIFICAN AMOUNTS OF CARBON N. AS A YOU ON THOUGH UNDER CALIFORNIA'S LANDMARK ENVIRONMENTAL LAW ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWO. THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP A SCOPING PLAN. A PLAN MAPPING OUT POSSIBLE APPROACHES. THAT OUR STATE CA TAKE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ME TO THE STATE'S EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS. UPDATED EVERY FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS THE SCOPING PLAN IS NON BINDING AND NON REGULATORY. IT'S SIMPLY LAYS OUT POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOR OUR STATE TO ACHIEVE ITS CLIMATE GOALS. AND IN PREPARATION FOR NEXT YEAR'S SCOPING PLAN UPDATE THIS LEGISLATION. WILL ENSURE THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD FULLY FULLY CONSIDER AND LEVERAGE THE CONSIDERABLE POWER AND POTENTIAL OF OUR STATE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS ACHIEVING OUR STATEWIDE EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS. AND POSSIBLY. AB ONE DAY ACHIEVE AN ECOLOGICAL BALANCE A BALANCE BETWEEN OUR CARBON EMISSIONS AND PROCESSES OR OR METHODS THAT REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THAT. OF THESE EMISSIONS. AND SO CLIMATE SCIENTISTS LEADING RESEARCHERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD AGREE WE HAVE TO DO MORE WE HAVE TO MAXIMIZE METHODS TO CAPTURE CARBON. UTILIZING OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS IF WE ARE GOING TO FEND OFF THE WORST IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. CLEARLY THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET WHEN IT COMES TO REMOVING CO TWO FROM THE ATMOSPHERE NO SINGLE TECHNOLOGY OR METHOD EXISTS. TO PROVIDE ALL THE CO TWO REMOVAL THAT IS REQUIRED. THERE IS OBVIOUS NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH WHEN IT COMES TO CARBON REMOVAL BUT A LARGE BODY OF EVIDENCE HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR. NAPOL WORKING LANDS INTERVENTIONS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY. TO WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE OF OUR TIME. AGAIN THIS UP SCORES ARE NEED TO FULLY LEVERAGE THE POTENTIAL OF OUR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS IN OUR CLIMATE CONVERSATION. BEST PRACTICES FOR SEQUESTERING RECOVERING CARBON A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE AND THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO US NOW. THESE NATURAL SOLUTIONS A CLOUD MANAGEMENT RESTORATION OF WOODLANDS AND WETLANDS AND RESTORING AND ENRICHING SOILS IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR WATER AND AIR QUALITY. ATTENTION WE HIGHER YIELDS FOR AGRICULTURE LAND CONSERVATION AND WILDFIRE PREVENTION. I SHOULD NOTE THAT NATURAL WORKING LANDS POLICIES PRACTICES OR PROGRAMS ARE NOTHING NEW TO OUR STATE THE NOTHING NEW TO CALIFORNIA. AS WE STATED AS WAS STATED IN A PREVIOUS ANALYSIS BY THE COMMITTEE. EFFORTS TO ENHANCE CARBON CAPTURE THROUGH OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS HAVE BEEN DONE ON A PROJECT BY PROJECT BASIS. AND OUR STATE HAS YET TO HAVE AN OFFICIAL OVERARCHING PLAN TO OR LEAD AGENCY TO COORDINATE A COHESIVE STRATEGY AROUND OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS. LET'S KEEP IN MIND IF YOU'RE SCOPING PLAN. PROJECTED THAT STATE LED EFFORTS TO CAPTURE. CARBON FROM NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS COULD RESULT IN THE IMAGE REDUCTIONS OF UP OF ABOUT THIRTY SIX MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO TAKING UP TO EIGHT MILLION EIGHT MILLION PASSENGER CARS OFF THE ROAD. WE HAVE REACHED THE POINT IN THIS CLIMATE CRISIS WHERE WE MUST DEVELOP PATHWAYS TO REMOVE CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. AND THIS LEGISLATION HELPS GET US THERE BY ENSURING THAT WE COLLABORATE AND IDENTIFY STRATEGIES TO INTEGRATE OUR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS AS ASSETS. IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. AGAIN THE SCOPING PLAN IS NON BINDING. IT IS NON REGULATORY. NON BINDING NON REGULATORY IT SIMPLY MAPS OUT POSSIBLE PATHWAYS TO REACH OUR STATE'S CLIMATE TARGETS. THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND RELEVANT AGENCIES CAN CONSIDER IN THE YEARS AHEAD SO WITH THAT MISTER SHARP.

WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY FOUR WHICH RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR CALIFORNIA TO ADVANCE THE CLINICAL AND RELATED STRATEGIES FOR BASS TO END IMPORTANCE NATURAL WORKING LANDS. I WANTED IT ADDRESS SOME OF THE COULD ABOUT THE BILL RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES IN AGRICULTURE. WE HAVE MODELING FOR THE STATE AND FROM OTHER RESEARCHERS THAT QUANTIFIES THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED CARBON SEQUESTRATION FROM AGRICULTURE BASED ON DIVERSITY IN HARLEM PRACTICES AS WELL AS OTHER STRATEGIES. AND I. SHOULD THE BILL BE NECESSARILY THINK IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO HAVE A VARIETY OF PASSED FORWARD TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND INCREASED CARBON SINKS ON FARMS. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY FOUR DOES NOTHING TO TAKE AWAY THAT FLEXIBILITY AND DIVERSITY. OF APPROACH MOREOVER MANY PROGRAM ARE UP THE AIR IN THE STATE- AS WE GRAPPLE WITH THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE CODE NINETEEN CRISIS. WE WILL NECESSARILY NEED TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO FUTURE FUNDING SOURCES TO SUPPORT THE CLAIM EFFORT. BUT REGARDLESS THE SHORT TERM BUT BUDGET DEFICIT AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY FOUR HAS A LONGER TERM VIEW OF WHAT IS NECESSARY TO HELP THE STATE SHE'S AT TWENTY FORTY FIVE CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL. WE SHOULD NOT BE STYMIED BY AIR INDIA CRISIS. NO IN AB NINE FIFTY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO IMPOSE REGULATIONS ON AGRICULTURE TO LIMIT OR CHANGE THE TYPE OF CROP. GROWN IN CALIFORNIA. THE BILL SIMPLY STATE THAT ERA BE INTENSIFIED BY CLIMATE GOAL INCLUDES NATURAL WORKING LANDS AND INCLUDES NATIONAL WORKING LIVE STRATEGIES IN THE BUILDING PLAN. DURING THE GROUND MAKE WE HAD MORE FORMER THAN EVER BEFORE SIGNING UP FOR THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM WHICH IS JUST ONE OF THE SWEET OF CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE IN THE STATE. ARTNET FOOD AGRICULTURE RECEIVED A RECORD NUMBER SIX HUNDRED HEALTHY SOILS APPLICATIONS FROM FARMERS AND RANCHERS. IN MARCH AND APRIL.

NINE FIFTY FOUR WE DON'T DISPUTE THAT OUR LAND MANY OF RETURN PRODUCTION I. ONE OF THE SOLUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T. FIND ACTUALLY PROUD OF THAT AND WE WANT EVERYTHING THAT DISCUSSION BUT WE ALSO KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE NEED TO TAKE A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH THAT REALLY. MATTERS THE DIVERSITY OF OUR CAPACITY AND ALL. THE STATE FUNDING AND SO YOU KNOW WE KNOW INHERENTLY OUR LAND WHAT'S YOUR CARBON BUT IN ORDER FOR US TO MORE. AT FARM. POCKET AND- ON.

IN AND- LOOKING AT THE CAR DEFICIT AND- FOR THE FOLLOW YEAR PARTICULARLY. RIGHT WHICH TRADITIONALLY FUNDED WORK BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY. THE DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY ON OUR ECONOMIC VIABILITY MAKES IT UNLIKELY THAT FUNDING WILL CONTINUE TO BE ADEQUATE TO MEET ME. SO CONSIDER THAT WERE REALLY DISAPPOINTED THE BILL DOESN'T MAKE ANY MEANT. AT ALL HAVE TO BE. FUNDING ADDITIONALLY WORKING LEARNING MAKING. TOWARD THE GOAL IT WILL. PERHAPS INTENTIONALLY CREATE WINNERS AND LOSERS- SOME COMMODITIES YEAH ACTUALLY HAVE GREATER CAPACITY. LESSER CARBON THAN OTHERS EVEN IF I PLAN TO MANAGE THE PROGRAM LATE. SO GIVEN NOT SOME PUNK MAY HAVE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN APPLYING FOR AND- OVER OTHERS. IT'S FUNDING. ALL FOR OPERATIONS. AT ARMS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CASH. ON THE- OKAY PROVIDE MATCH FUNDS. I READILY AS FAR LARGER AMONG PROFITABLE. AND SO WELL THERE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW HI PROFIT MAJOR. DOING GREAT WORK IN A HEARTBEAT SITUATION THEY ARE MINOR. FARMS ARE ON IMPORTANT. SO ADDED COMPONENT IN BILL YOU INSURE THAT THE H. OF THE WILL. REGIONAL AND COMMODITY EQUITY. WE FEARED THE INCOMING.

YES THANK YOU- CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WILL MOVE IT NOW. AND. I JUST- THERE WE HAVE LEGITIMATELY BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON THE PANDEMIC THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AS A RESULT OF THAT AND TO MAKE. HOWEVER IT IS. BIGGEST CHALLENGE TO OT ONLY OUR STATE OUR COUNTRY INNER GLOW BUT ALSO TO OUR GLOW IS THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND IRATE WHILE. THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT WE DO TO ADDRESS IT. SHE ALWAYS HAVE MULTIPLE SOCKS. IT IS IMPERATIVE. ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE WE HAVE LOST SO MUCH GROUND AND WE'RE AT THE POINT NOW WHERE THE ICE SHEETS IN GREENLAND ARE PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN THEY WILL NOT EVEN IF WE WERE TO STOP. ALL RELEASES OF CARBON WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RESTORE THE ICE ON GREENLAND WE CANNOT GET TO THAT POINT. IN EITHER OF OUR POLLS IN ANTARCTICA OR THE NORTH POLE YOU CAN NOT AFFORD TO GET TO THAT POINT. AND WE ARE DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THAT POINT SO. WELL THIS BILL ALONE WILL NOT REVERSE THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND I URGE. ALL OF THE MEMBERS TO SUPPORT IT AND I THINK THE MEMBER OR BRING IT FORWARD AND AS I INDICATED BEFORE I'M OF THE BILL. THEY WERE CAST. RICHARD THANK YOU I WILL NOT BE THE SUPPORTING THE BILL IN THE FORM DEBTS THAT IT'S IN I A- I APPRECIATE THE ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE MEMBERS HAVE I WILL. REMIND THE ADVOCATES THAT THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE THE LAST TWO YEARS HAS HAD FUNDING IN THE BUDGET FOR FROM CAP AND TRADE IN IN ORDER TO DIRECT IT AT. AT WORKING LANDS THIS YEAR THERE WAS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS REMOVED BY THE GOVERNOR IN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE FINAL NEGOTIATION SO THIS IS NOT A NEW TOPIC. AND THE SCALLOPS SENATE IS COMMITTED TO WORKING ON WORKING LANDS WITH THAT SAID MY CONCERN AND I'M SURE THE MEN WILL SHARE THEM WITH THE AUTHOR IS IT THIS GREAT EXPERIENCE THE AUTHORITY OF THE OF THE YEAR BOARD- AND I'M- CONCERNED WITH THAT- THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. SCHOOL PLAN HAS A LOT OF. THE CRITICISM THAT HAS BEEN. POLICE TO GRAB GET IT YOU KNOW BY. CAN TED THE AIRPORTS RIGHT NOW AND K. AND TRADE HASN'T CORRECT THE CHALLENGE THE- IN A FISH THAT WE'VE WE'VE OUT TO IT SO THAT THAT ARE IN THAT PROGRAM RUNS BY CODIFY. THE NEW. TO I'M NEUTRAL IT LET THE AIRPORT OFF THE HOOK THAT THEY HAVE TO. THAT IN A FEW IN AN ATTIC THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE CURRENCY PLAY IN THE CURRENT CAP AND TRADE AND ALLOWS HIM TO USE THAT. ARE IN TRUCK COVER NEUTRAL IN THE FUTURE TO CHI THE GOALS WE WANT ALL THE COMPONENT PARTS WORKING SO THAT. AT THAT CONCERNS ME I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE AIRPORT SHOULD BE THE FINAL SAY ON CRAP AND SHRUBLANDS NATURAL RESOURCE THIS IS A MORE. AGENCY TO BE ABLE TO WE SHOOT FOR A IN THE GRASS. ALSO IS WE. AS A MEMBER MULLINS BURKE POINTS OUT OFFICE OF. SEARCH IS THE- INTER AGENCY PLAN A SALUTE ASSOCI OBVIOUSLY THE BOARD SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO ON THAT WORK LAND. BUT WE DO IT SO. RELATED IT'S A LEAD TO IT'S. THREE IT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT. I AM. HI I HAVE ADDITIONALLY. P. THE BILL. FORMALIZES THE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS AS PART OF THE SCOPING PROCESS IN AGAIN THIS THESE SECTORS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES THAT WERE YOU'RE USED TO MEASURE COMPLIANCE WITH SB THIRTY TWO OR AB THIRTY TWO AND THEREFORE ARE RELEVANT FOR THAT SCHOOL BEING PLANNED OR RELEVANT FOR THE- OUR GOALS THE BESIDES A CAP AND TRADE X. AMENDMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED THAT CARVE DEVELOP. INTO EIGHT. THROUGH RULE MAKING AS THAT ARE TO THEM OFFICIALLY PART OF THE STATE GREEN GAS INVENTORY INCLUDING A FULL BETTER PUTTING WORKING LANDS. IN THE IN PART AS A SCOPING PLAN- WHICH- THEY HAVEN'T DONE THIS STATE AND THEY COULDN'T DO THIS UNLESS THEY CHANGED THAT RULE MAKING ANALYSIS AMENDMENT WOULD ALSO BE NEEDED. THAT ANY DECISION TO USE NATURAL WORKING LANDS IN THE SCOPING PLAN WILL ACCOUNT FOR BOTH SEQUESTRATION AND EMISSIONS SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A FIRE WE DON'T COUNT THOSE ADMISSIONS IN OUR GREENHOUSE GAS. SO IF YOU GET A CAN'T SEEK AND IT'S ONLY THAT YOU CAN'T EMISSIONS AND AMENDMENTS SHOULD ALSO BE. INCLUDED ON SOIL CARBON PRACTICE IT'S TO IF YOU'RE INCLUDING SOIL PRACTICING THE SEQUESTRATION YOU NEED TO BE AT LEAST A METER IN DEPTH BECAUSE SHALLOW CREDITING HAS SHOWN TO BE AN EFFECTIVELY. INEFFECTIVE IN DELIVERING THE CLIMATE BENEFITS A WEEK YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE- OFFSETS THAT WE HAVE A CARBON PROGRAM WE FIND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED ON THIS ACTIVITY WITHOUT THE- CITY AIRPORT GIVE SOME CREDIT. AND I'M CONCERNED IF WE DON'T DO PROPER SEQUESTRATION WORKING LANDS DON'T GET IT AND IN SOME OF THE FINDINGS- IN THE BILL I WOULD. WANT THEM TO BE STRICKEN I'M SHARING THAT WITH THE ADVOCATES FOR THE DAY HERE CRITICISM I WOULD BE GOING. UP BILL. YOUR BY CONCERNED THE STAFF. IN WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU I MEAN IS IT I SEE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING YOU BEEN DISCUSS SOME OF THESE WITH AUTHOR THE AUTHOR IS OPEN AT LEAST THAT MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. YEAH SO WE HAD- INITIAL- THE CONVERSATION YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WITH THE COMPRESSED- THE TIMELINE THAT WERE WORKING UNDER- YEAH WE HAVE HAD THAT INITIAL- I CONVERSATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING FOR THE- OKAY I WOULD I WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE. HI TRACY CENTER HEALTH CENTRE DOLLY CENTER STERN CENTER BATES WITH MICHAEL GETS RICHER JUST VERY BRIEFLY- YOU KNOW I DO SUPPORT THE-COMMENTS OF US SENATOR SKINNER I THINK SHE WAS OF RIGHT ON THE MARK WITH WHICH SHE HAD TO SAY. RELATED TO THE TO THE BILL- I. DISAGREE WITH SENATOR WHITE CASKET SOMEONE WHO SAT ON THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN. IS HE A REAL FIRST AFTER THE FIRST ITERATION OF THE- SCOPING PLAN WAS DEVELOPED THIS IS THE PLACE. THAT IS THE PLACE TO DISCUSS THIS TO DEAL WITH IT AND TO- LOOK AT THE- SEQUESTRATION AND ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES INVOLVED I JUST THINK THE- AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS THE APPROPRIATE PLACE. TO HAVE THIS DISEASE THE PURPOSE I'M SORRY. YOU SAID YOU GET IS THE EVERYBODY'S. YES YES OKAY OKAY YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO. I'LL CERTAINLY BE WHICH IS SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SENATE HEALTH CENTER DOLLARS. FAVORITES SHARE. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START. THAT'S A AS SOMEBODY WHO IS FAMILIES FOR GENERATIONS BEEN WORKING LANDSCAPE. AND I'VE ALSO BEEN REGULATED BY. MULTIPLE AGENCIES ABOUT HOW I OPERATE MY WORKING LANDSCAPE SO FIRST I WANTED TO SAY TO THE AUTHOR I TOTALLY RESPECTED AND UNDERSTAND- YEAH THERE'S A CHALLENGE AND I LOOK AT THE LOOK AT THE SUPPORT AND I LOOK AT THE OPPOSITION. OPPOSITIONS ARE MY NEIGHBORS WHO ARE PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR. CALIFORNIANS AND THE LIKE IN THE IN THE IN THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT IT ARE PEOPLE THAT RECEIVED THE GRANT MONIES THAT. DO CONSERVATION WORK ON AROUND IN AND NEAR ME SO I GET THAT I GET THAT THEY'RE WANTING MORE MONEY AND- AND TO DRIVE N. IN IT TO THE POINT THAT. THAT THE GRACE DINNER FROM BERKELEY SENATOR SKINNER MADE ABOUT YOU KNOW. COBIT IN AND THEIR LIKES WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD A ROBUST DEBATE THIS BILL. NEED TO DEBATE THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PIECES IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THERE'S- NATURAL RESOURCES THERE'S FIRE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN IN TRYING TO. TALK ABOUT SEQUESTERING CARBON AND HOW WE CAN ON IT AND HOW WE WHAT WHAT WHAT EMISSIONS ARE WHEN YOU. WHEN YOU HAVE A FIRE OR YOU HAVE A METAL YOUR THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT BACK IN I MEAN I'VE DONE AND- I WASN'T THESE BUT ON THIS YEAR AMERICAN. THESE WORKING LANDS. WE ON AND I THINK THAT WE'RE DOING A DISSERVICE TO THE PEOPLE WHO OWN LAND AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE THAT BALANCE THAT WE HAVE ARE WE MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD AYE AYE. I DON'T SEE HOW THIS FITS IN THE COVE IT AT ALL I THINK THIS NEEDS A LOT MORE DEBATE. A LOT MORE TO DEBATE FROM. PARTIES AT THE TABLE AND I'M SAYING IS THE WAY THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM TO GROW HERE I THINK WE I THINK WE NEED. ABOUT HOW HE MANAGED WELLS. BUT WHO DOES THAT IS TO ME IN MY MIND IS NOT THE AIRPORT. THERE NEEDS TO BE THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAG THE TABLE THERE NEEDS TO BE FARM THREE PEOPLE ALL TABLE BUT JUST A- PUSHING DOWN ON I'VE BEEN. ON THE END OF RISK. A LOT OF WHAT I WOULD SAY BAD POLICIES I PUSH BACK FOR YEARS. HONOR FORESTRY PRACTICES. ON HOW WE DO CARBON SEQUESTRATION THE FORCED. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CALCULATIONS HERE THE NEED TO TAKE PLACE. ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF CARBON OR THE- MEAN. THERE'S OVER 50% OF THE ROOT BASE OF A TREE IS IN THE GROUND WHICH IS THE QUESTION CAR ONCE GROWING BUT WE WANT TO HARVEST THAT TOP OR IT'S GOING TO BE OMITTED OTHERWISE THERE'S A LOT TO BE TALKED ABOUT IN THIS POSITION THOSE REASONS. I THINK WE SHOULD. WE'LL DO IT RIGHT THERE'S NO URGENCY TO MOVE THIS BILL. FORWARD AND DO IT WRONG AND WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THE POWER TO THE WRONG AGENCY MY MIND AND I SEE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE STAKEHOLDERS. THE GENERATIONS OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS LIKE MYSELF. ARE IN OPPOSITION THIS BECAUSE WE NEED TO TAKE OUR TIME AND DO IT RIGHT SO FOR THOSE IS I NOT GONNA BE BORING THE BILL TODAY. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS REALLY DOESN'T MEET THE STANDARD OF COVERT I GOT I GOT BILL THE BARCODE WE'RE NOT IN A VERY FRUSTRATED ABOUT THE FACT THAT. REAL THEIR- PUTTING NURSES. IN HOSPITAL. HERE IN THOSE BILLS AND WE'RE HERE TO BUILD A NEED TO TAKE MORE TIME AND IT'S REALLY NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO COPE WITH SO I'M FRUSTRATED THE FACT THAT. AND SO I AND I KNOW. THAT I JUST WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL TO EVERYBODY HERE THAT IT DOES IT'S NOT PERSONAL IT'S JUST IT'S A VERY. FRUSTRATING IN A SESSION HERE WHERE I SEE BILLS LIKE THIS THAT NEED MORE WORK AND I SEE BILLS THAT HAVE- AT. COVERT RELATED THAT THERE BE INTEREST SO FOR THOSE. THESE OPPOSING THE BILL. PLEASE YEAH OF COURSE YOU KNOW KNOW THIS CERTAIN IS NOT. HERE AND BILL AB BUT I BUT I GET YOUR I GET YOUR BROADER POINT. I STERN. THANK YOU MISS CHAIR GOOD COULD DISCUSS SO FAR. WELL I GUESS WHAT THE COMMENT IN A QUESTION I WHAT I SENSE IS. FROM SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE THESE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUE THAT THIS ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH THAT THERE'S A CONCERN THAT. PUTTING OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS IN A CARBON NEUTRALITY CONTEXT WOULDN'T BE TOUGH ENOUGH ON- THOSE SECTORS. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I HEAR THAT THE BILL- IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING JUST LET THE ADMINISTRATION KEEP DOING THEIR THING THAT'S WHAT WE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. AND THEN CONCERNS FROM SOME OF SOME OTHERS THAT ARE OPPOSED SAYING OF THE BILL THERE'S WAY TOO MUCH. SO RIGHT I JUST WANT TO GET IT CLEAR THIS LEGISLATION DOESN'T PUT SOUL REGULATORY. OR EVEN ANY PRIMARY REGULATORY AUTHORITY WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD FOR ANY KIND OF ENFORCEMENT REGIME OR ANY KIND OF REGULATORY ACTION OR EVEN ANY KIND OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT TO KIND OF WORK FOR INSTANCE GOING ON AT. CDFA RIGHT NOW THROUGH A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS THEY HAVE THEIR- THROUGH DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WHERE FOLKS ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT AND- WE NEED TO W. ARE ENGAGED. ASEAN ARE A NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCY WHERE WE KNOW WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT A BRING FORESTRY INTO THE URBAN CONVERSATION. AND IN FACT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY. TO HAVE A SURVIVING TIMBER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA FRANKLY IS THROUGH CARMEN AND I THINK FRANKLY THE ONLY WAY FOR THE CALIFORNIA FARMER. TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE IS BY EMBRACING THIS REGION I HAVE TO SAY THAT. I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR SO MANY ADVOCATES I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S FARMERSOR JUST THE ADVOCATES AND- AND WORKING ABOUT- YOU KNOW HOW. BUT I TALKED TO AND THAT YOU KNOW I REPRESENT HERE. INCREDIBLY CREATIVE AND ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT- FOLKS INTERESTED IN BIO CHAR PEOPLE LIKE AGRA MEN AND WATCHING AT LEMAN ERA DOES THEIR CITRUS BUSINESS AND IN VENTURA COUNTY OR SOME OF THE RANCHERS WE WORK WITHIN NORTH L. A. COUNTY LOOKING AT RANGELANDS AND GRAZING POTENTIAL. THIS TO ME IS ACTUALLY THE FUTURE OF PROSPERITY IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE SO I REALLY AM DISAPPOINTED I WILL SAY IN THE ANXIETY FROM THE OPPOSITION TODAY LOOK I GET IT. BUT TO CALL THIS AN OPEN ENDED- GIVE AWAY TO THE YEAR RESOURCES BORDER SOMEHOW- I DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT IT- ON. A MARK AGAINST CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTANDING THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GO AND IN MY- MIND TO IT IN. A VOTER TODAY IF THERE'S NOT IN I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR TO THIS MEASURE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK DEARBORN SHOULD BE PURSUING THEIR NATURAL WORKING LANDS POLICY. WITH A LEGISLATURE. WE DON'T. THE OPPOSITION JUST SAID THERE WERE WILL KEEP YOU THEIR WORK THERE'S ARE MRRY WERE GROUP BIG. WILL WEIGH IN IN THE SCOPE PLAN ON THIS WITHOUT. BUT I THINK THE LEADS SHOULD BE. AS CONTROL THIS FR IF WE WANT TO GET A MORE FOR. ALONG THE LINES THAT CENTER Y. CASKEY MENTIONED WE'RE WE'RE REALLY CLEAR FOR INSTANCE ABOUT HOW THE OPR CITED THINGS FIT ST SOME OF THEIR MODELING OR REALLY CLEAR THAT YOU KNOW WANT. TO RISK STAGE IN STATE TAKING THE LABORING COME. FOR PLANS SEE. ON AGRICULTURAL. LET'S LET'S ADD A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. HERE BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S SOME FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN FACT I THINK IF WE DON'T. GET THIS BILL THROUGH THIS YEAR. IT WAS THAT HAVE BEEN NEWBORNS A CAP INTO THE SECTOR. THAT MONEY THAT DIDN'T UP THIS YEAR THAT HUNDRED MILLION IF WE HAD THIS SPACE. EVERYONE AT THE- PUTTING THEIR- FOR AND REAL HAVING SOME MATH TO LEAN ON TO JUSTIFY IT. I THINK THIS COULD BE THE LARGEST FUTURE INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION. AND SEQUESTRATION YOU CAN DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME SO I'LL BE HARDLY SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. COULD YOU CENTER LET'S GO NEXT TO CENTER BATES. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN NOT ALLEN UP I GUESS MY CONCERNS WITH US ALL ALONG THE LINE YOUR CENTER CHOI CALCIUM SENATOR DOLLY BY THE WAY I READ THIS IT SAYS IT REQUIRES THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD CREATE CLIMATE GOALS. FOR NATURAL WORKING LANDS AND THOSE SALINAS 90% OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IN THE NOT SO HUGE OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND ALSO AN AUTHORITY THAT I DON'T FIND ANY WITHIN THE BILL. REQUIRES IT BEING BROUGHT BACK TO A LEGISLATURE IN. FACT IT MY TIME ON. L. COMMITTEE ASKING THIS ALLOWS FIVE OF APPS SERVED ON IT I'VE ALWAYS REYES AYE ISSUE THAT MUCH OF THE RECOMMENDED MUCH OF THE- REGULATIONS THAT ARE FOR MEDIAN FORMATTED BY A R. B. REALLY JUST STAY THERE EXIST THERE IN AND BECOME MANDATES ON THOSE WHO HAVE TO A LITTLE BEFORE THE BOARD AND GET THEIR PROGRAM- ARE THERE THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. IS SO FAR REACHING THEIR SHOULD RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME BACK TO THIS LEGISLATURE AND BACK TO WHAT SENATOR DALIAN AND SENATOR Y. KASKI SAID THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT IT THERE NEEDS TO BE ON THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP INVOLVED BECAUSE IT IS A MUCH BIGGER IN MUCH BROADER. THE NEW. SO THAT REASON I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY AND I WILL HOPE. BECAUSE I WON TO FACE YOU TO THE AUTHOR I MEAN. CLIMATE WOLF WILL CLIMATE CHANGE ALL OF THAT EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY NOT MANY THERE ARE SOME. BAD TO ADULTS DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE GOT TO BE ARE YOU KNOW WORKING VERY ARE. BIGGER US LADY AND VERY COMMITTED TO FINDING ANSWERS TO OUR DESK AND HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY AND THE AUTHORS PROVIDED THAT BUT NOT I DON'T THINK I PROCESS. THAT CAN BE BALANCED AND FAIR WYNETTE THERE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY. FOR INTO IN THE FINAL IMPLEMENTATION THAT MAY COME OUT AS MANDATE. SO I WON'T SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I DO ENCOURAGE US TO CONTINUE TO WORK. ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT MORE VOICES AND IT HAPPENS OFTEN IN WHAT STATE. THERE REALLY ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE GRAHAM WELL WHAT CAN BE FAR REACHING. I IMPACTS. THE BULLS WILL BE. HE'S NOT NECESSARY NEGATIVE IMPACTS. I ALSO THINK YOU FOR OUR FOR. SPEAK ON. HOPEFULLY GOING FORWARD YOU IT'LL MUCH. WITH THE YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR CLEARLY SOME MORE WORK TO BE CENTER OF DOLLY. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO- SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT. THE ABSOLUTELY THERE'S A LOT OF US FARMERS WHO ARE INVESTING IN BIO CHAR AND SEQUESTERING CARBON BUT I WANT BUT I WANT TO SHARE THIS IS WAS WHEN WE HAD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF. BACK WHEN I WAS VICE CHAIR IN THE ASSEMBLY. CHESBRO WITH THE CHAIR. YOU KNOW WE HAD THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IN MERRY NICHOLS RIGHT THERE AND WE ASK ABOUT WHILE PARTISAN GIVING ANALOGY HERE OF. OF I THINK THE DISCONNECT. TO WIN WE GIVE THEM CARTE BLANCHE TO GO. IN AND THEY GO WE I WE SAID WHAT ABOUT THE MISSIONS OF WILDFIRE. VERSES YOU KNOW REGULATING. COMBUSTIBLE ENGINES AND IT IS LIKE THERE'S A TO JOB SO THE MONEY SHOULD BE GOING TO. YOU KNOW PERTAINING TO FORCED AND THE LIKES AND YOU'RE SHUTTING DOWN POWER PLANTS THAT TAKE THAT FUEL TO TIME SHE SAID WELL SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS. THAT'S THAT'S THE WRONG ATTITUDE DATA NEED TO BE WORK WITH THE LANDOWNER WORK WITH TO WORK WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE TRYING TO DO THESE THINGS WITHOUT THE HAMMER AND I THINK THIS IS THIS. IS IT WHEN I HEARD THAT THE GOVERNOR'S GOING ALONG IS DOING HIS OWN THING. WELL THIS PUTS IN LAWS TOGETHER THAT THE- REIN HIM IN. IF WE DON'T LIKE IT THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T GONNA DO IT. THIS IS GIVING THE POWER TO THEIR BOARD WITHOUT THE RESOURCES EVEN GET IT DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHICH IS WHAT. CENTER Y. CASKEY BROUGHT UP SO I WANTED TO JUST KIND OF PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT. THAT WE HAD WE HAVEN'T ASKED THE NEXT SESSION TO TAKE. IN A MORE MEETING FOR WAY. BUT RIGHT. YOU MISTER FOR INDULGE ME. PLEASE ENTER- CENTER STARTED YOU HAVE A THERE'S A FOLLOW UP FOR. NOW HE WANTED HE WOULD HOST A COLLEGE DEBATE ON THAT CARBONS THE QUESTION WELL SORT OF IT'S- A GREAT. FINALLY CANTOR DEBATER. FURTHER THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HE LIVES IN THE HEART OF A ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL REGIONS IN THE STATE I THINK HE'S GOT A DEEP DEEP PERSONAL EQUITY STAKE IN ALL THESE OUTCOMES AND I RESPECT THAT THERE CAN BE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION I JUST THINK WE CAN'T. FEAR CARBON HERE I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY THE FUTURE OF FARMING AND- I GET THAT THERE'S A HISTORY OF. MISTRUST AND YOU GOTTO HAVE SOME EXPERT DO THIS WORK FOR THE TARGET SETTING. THAT IS THE AIRPORT'S LANE FOR THE REST OF EVERYTHING I THINK WE GET CLEAR ABOUT LET'S PUT CDS FANTOMEX LET'S LET'S CROSS REFERENCE THE NRA LET'S ASK LET'S SAY THERE NEEDS TO BE ADEQUATE ONGOING FUNDING TO MAKE THIS STUFF WORKS. THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME WAYS THROUGH THIS I THINK I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ACTUALLY THAT FAR APART I GET THE TIME IS TRICKY BUT- ACTUALLY I THINK THOSE THAT ARE PART. THANK YOU VERY CENTER OKAY- SEE NO FURTHER COMMENT WELL AS I CENTER SKINNER SINISTER. I THANK YOU CHAIR SO I DIDN'T RULE I ADDRESSED CLIMATE CRISIS IN GENERAL WHEN I SPOKE I DID NOT A DEPRESSED SO MUCH SPECIFICALLY. THIS BILL BUT I THINK GIVEN THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED. FIRST HEALTHY SOILS ACT LANDS HAVE BE BEST OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW GIVEN WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM FOSSIL FUELS WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IS THIS INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN HEALTHY SOILS IN THE SCIENCE ON IT IS PHENOMENAL AND IT BENEFITS ERICA COULTER. SO I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW MY GOOD COLLEAGUE- FROM THE NORTHERN EASTERN PART OF OUR STATE CONCERN THAT. YOU KNOW OUR RESOURCES BOARD MAY NOT FACTOR THE NEEDS OF FARMERS AS ADEQUATELY AS HE HOPES BUT I GUESS WHAT WHAT I FEWEST NUMBER ONE. THERE'S INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND HEALTHY SOILS IT BENEFITS ACT AND NUMBER TWO. RESOURCES BOARD THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN THEM THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SET TARGETS AND USED TO FROM THE DAY WE FIRST TOOK A CLEAR POSITION OF CLIMATE CRISIS AB THIRTY CHIU AND ALL SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION NOW CERTAINLY THERE ARE MANY OTHER AGENCIES THAT NEED TO BE INVOLVED. AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IN. THE BY TAKING THIS STEP NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY NEXT YEAR. IN THE BUDGET OR ANY SUBSEQUENT BILL TO ADD TO THIS PROCESS WE OR TO EVEN REFINE. THE AUTHORITY. THIS IS NOT AN END ALL BE ALL AND IT DOES NOT CUT OFF THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO FURTHER SHAPE. BUT IT IS A CLEAR MESSAGE NOW IN THE APPROPRIATE MESSAGE NOW AND I AM. APPRECIATE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPECIFY MY COMMENTS MORE TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIRTY CENTER. OKAY FIVE LET'S GIVE THE AUTHOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE. YEAH I DON'T REALLY YOU TAKE IN A MOMENT IF YOU RESPONDED SENATOR BAKER NO I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF THE DEBATE TO THE ROBUST DEBATE AND THE COMMENTS AND I THINK. YOU KNOW A COMMENT THAT WAS MADE BY SENATOR STERN- WAS A VERY IMPORTANT A POINT THAT HE MADE AND THAT THIS THIS THIS THIS BILL- IS IT ABOUT THE AIR RESOURCES THE OF THE A. R. B. MANAGING SOILS AND- YOU KNOW. IT CETERA. THIS LEGISLATION ABOUT EXPLORING CREATING- POSSIBLE OPTIONS. AND IF THOSE OPTIONS ARE VIABLE. THEN THEY ABSOLUTELY NEED TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR POSSIBLE ADOPTION AND WE HAVE THAT ROBUST DEBATE. ON HOW THOSE OPTIONS COULD BE IMPLEMENTED MOVING FORWARD. YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE COMMENTS FROM OPPOSITION THE FARM BUREAU YEAH I AGREE WITH THE FARM BILL RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO CONSIDER THE DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR NATURAL WORK IN LANSING CALIFORNIA UNLIKE ANY OTHER STATE IT'S INCREDIBLY DIVERSE AND THE VERY DIFFERENT AND HOW WE- TREAT OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS- IN ONE PART OF STAYS IN THE MUCH DIFFERENT OTHER PARTS OF STATE AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL- YOU KNOW THIS THIS. THIS THIS EFFORT IS A YOU KNOW IT PROPOSES TO BE A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT YOU KNOW THE BILL STATES YOU KNOW FOR. FOR STATE AGENCIES TO ENGAGE THE SUPPORT PARTICIPATION IN PARTNERSHIP OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY OF OUR AGRICULTURAL SECTOR- YOU KNOW IN IN IN YOU KNOW OTHER COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE YOU KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS. YOU KNOW IT'S ABOUT CREATING A GOAL AROUND NOW TO WORKING LANDS CREATING A BLUEPRINT OR ROADMAP IN THE END OF THIS. TO FUND CARBON REMOVAL PRACTICE. AS THE BILL STILL. THIS LEGISLATION. SEEKS TO AGAIN ESTABLISH IT IS BROUGH PLANT OF ESTABLISH A BLUEPRINT- THIS DEVILISH IN YOUR IDENTIFY PRACTICES BEST PRACTICES POLICY INCENTIVES POTENTIAL POLICY INCENTIVES. AND POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN BARRIERS THAT WOULD HELP ACHIEVE THIS GOAL LONG TERM. IT IF THERE IS A VIABLE OPTIONS OUT THERE. IN THE NEED TO HAVE THE CONSIDERATION OF THE FARM% BILL SUGGESTING TO FUND THE OPTIONS. BECAUSE CERTAINLY WHAT IS BETTER YOU KNOW WHAT IS BEST MANAGING OUR LANDS IS GOING TO BE BEST FOR OUR STATE BEST FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT IT'S GOING TO HELP EXPAND OUR PRIME A PORTFOLIO AND MEET OUR CLIMATE. GOALS THAT WE HAVE AT THE STATE. BUT WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO BE HERE APPRECIATE ALL OF THE COMMENTS.
