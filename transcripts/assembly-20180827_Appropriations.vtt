00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:23.536 region:rollup2
EXACTLY SIGNIFICANT.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:24.170 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS THE OVERSIGHT DOES

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:25.605 region:rollup2
HAS NO EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.573 region:rollup2

IN THIS AREA THEY DO A GREAT JOB

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:31.311 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE LICENSING.

HOUSE THE THEY WOULD HAVE TO

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.220 region:rollup2
HIRE OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS EXPERTS

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:42.555 region:rollup2
IN THIS AREA WHICH ARE NOT --

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.257 region:rollup2
INEXPENSIVE ACTION VERY

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:45.925 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE --

00:13:44.257 --> 00:13:47.327 region:rollup2
THE BILL ALSO THE ALTHOUGH IT

00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:49.162 region:rollup2
DOES LAY OUT FIVE DIFFERENT

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:50.330 region:rollup2
FACTORS THAT THAT THE BILL NEEDS

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:52.632 region:rollup2
TO CONSIDER.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.033 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT EXCLUSIVE TO THOSE FIVE

00:13:52.632 --> 00:13:55.635 region:rollup2
FACTORS SO IT COULD BE FIFTY

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.903 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FACTORS DE REALIZING

00:13:55.635 --> 00:13:58.471 region:rollup2
QUITE DECIDED WHETHER.

00:13:56.903 --> 00:14:01.007 region:rollup2
WHICH FACTORS ARE GOING TO USE

00:13:58.471 --> 00:14:04.344 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO CREATE IN THE MATRIX

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:05.111 region:rollup2

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.212 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS TO BE DONE BY THE

00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:06.946 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT --

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:08.581 region:rollup2
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:09.982 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY IN THAT AREA WE

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:10.983 region:rollup2
THINK THE COSTS ARE ACTUALLY

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:12.085 region:rollup2
PROBABLY CLOSE TO MILLION

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:13.319 region:rollup2
DOLLARS JUST THAT HIRING

00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:14.153 region:rollup2

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:38.378 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE TO DO THAT --

00:14:37.744 --> 00:14:40.680 region:rollup2

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:42.749 region:rollup2
--

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.817 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE RATE WORKS FOR
