ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN VALLADARES WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN ON AB THREE TWENTY ONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB THREE TWENTY ONE WILL HELP SOME OF OUR STATE'S MOST DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN LOW INCOME DAHLE ENGLISH LEARNERS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PRIORITY ENROLLMENT FOR STATE CHILD FOR SERVICES AND PRESCHOOL. UNFORTUNATELY ENGLISH LEARNERS TYPICALLY LAG BEHIND THEIR NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKING PEERS ACADEMICALLY. THE PERFORMANCE ON STATEWIDE TESTS CONSISTENTLY RANKS LOWER THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER MEASURE CATEGORY OF STUDENTS MANY ENGLISH LEARNERS WHO ARE UNABLE TO ATTAIN ENGLISH PROFICIENCY FACE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE DIFFICULTIES IN THE CLASSROOM. EVERYTHING FROM UNFAMILIARITY WITH VOCABULARY AND CULTURAL CONTEXT TO FEAR OF IN CLASSROOM PARTICIPATION CONTRIBUTE TO THE POORER ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS WORSENED THE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES OF MOSUL LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND ENGLISH LEARNERS. THE LA UNIFED SCHOOL DISTRICT REPORTED THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF ENGLISH LEARNERS FAILING THEIR CLASSES HAS INCREASED TEN PERCENT. SACRAMENTO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ALSO REPORTED THE OTHER STUDENTS THAT STOPPED REPORT REPORTING TO CLASS OVER 44% MORE ENGLISH LEARNERS. LEARNING ENGLISH IS TOUGH AS IT IS BUT LEARNING AND ISOLATION AT HOME WITH FEWER RESOURCES HAS MADE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND ENGLISH LEARNER LEARNERS TO BECOME PROFICIENT. UNFORTUNATELY ENGLISH TO ACHIEVE ENGLISH. ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED. IN THE CLASSROOM THAT ENGLISH LEARNERS IN GENERAL. WHAT POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA REPORT FOUND THAT THROUGHOUT GRADES TWO TO ELEVEN FORMER ENGLISH LEARNERS WHO BECAME PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON STATEWIDE TESTS THAN ENGLISH LEARNERS IN GENERAL. AND EVEN HIGHER THAN NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS DID IN SOME OF THE GRADE LEVELS. A RECENT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO STUDY CONFIRMS THAT ENGLISH LEARNERS WHO ACHIEVED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY BY EIGHTH GRADE ACTUALLY PERFORMED AS WELL AS AS IN SOME CASES BETTER ON TESTS THAN THEIR NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKING PEERS DO. THE SOONER ENGLISH LEARNERS LEARN ENGLISH THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO PERFORM WELL IN SCHOOL AB THREE TWENTY ONE HELPS LOW INCOME DAHLE LANGUAGE LEARNERS IMPROVE ACCESS TO VITALLY IMPORTANT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. BY MAKING THEM ELIGIBLE FOR PRIORITY ENROLLMENT FOR STATE CHILD CARE SERVICES AND PRESCHOOL AB THREE TWENTY ONE OFFERS ONE MEANINGFUL WAY FOR THE STATE TO HELP LOW INCOME BUILDING WHICH LEARNERS. TO BETTER REQUIRE ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY BEFORE THEY ENTER TO K. THROUGH TWELVE TESTIFYING TODAY I DO HOT IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE TWENTY ONE AS BRIAN BOEHNER WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARENT TEACHER ASSOCIATION. BRIAN AT HEAD MISTER VAN WAGNER.

ESTATE SUPPORTER PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE PROGRAMS THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL ARE CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES OF CALIFORNIA STATE PTA. INCLUDING ADVOCATE TO ACHIEVE JUSTICE FOR ALL CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES THEY HAVE THEIR ESSENTIAL NEEDS BEST.

CALIFORNIA STATE PTA OFFERS THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ON THE B. THREE TWENTY ONE. AB T.

BY CREATING ACCESS TO THE SERVICES FOR THE LANGUAGE LEARNERS THIS BILL WOULD HELP MORE- THE LANGUAGE LEARNERS ACQUIRE ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY AND BE BETTER PREPARED FOR EIGHT TO TWELVE SCHOOLS. UNFORTUNATELY ENGLISH LEARNERS- LEG BEHIND THEIR NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKING PEERS ACADEMICALLY. THE PERFORMANCE OF CALIFORNIA ENGLISH LEARNERS A STATEWIDE TESTS CONSISTENTLY RANKS LOWER THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER MEASURED STUDENT GROUP. HOWEVER STUDIES CONFIRM THAT THE SOONER ENGLISH LEARNERS LEARN ENGLISH THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO PERFORM WELL IN SCHOOL. ONE WAY THAT CALIFORNIA CAN HELP ENGLISH LEARNERS LEARNING WAS EARLY ON IS TO PROVIDE THEM EARLY EXPOSURE TO ENGLISH IN CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL SENTENCE. BILL LANGUAGE LEARNERS THAT ARE ROLLED INTEL CARE PRESCHOOL. ARE FOUND TO EXIT THOSE PROGRAMS WITH VASTLY IMPROVED ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERACY SKILLS. ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF WHAT LANGUAGE THEY SPEAK SHOULD HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO ACCESS HIGH QUALITY- DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATE CHILDCARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABILITY. TO INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME BILL LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP PROVIDE THESE CHILDREN A STRONG STRONGER A FOUNDATION.
