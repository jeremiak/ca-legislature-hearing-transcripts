leadership from the campus and then we're gonna open up to student testimony or anyone who's here would like to share their thoughts can. Do that so all to visually take the gavel up. Signal to the audio video crew. Okay so we're gonna officially call the Senate. Select committee on student success to order here in Sacramento state. To be here this is a part of our a two year long tour of college campuses around California. That focuses on the issues of student needs -- As it relates to food as it relates to housing. As it relates to mental health. And also importantly as it relates to the ability of students to get through and get their degree -- And for years I'm joined on this panel by many distinguished leaders here from this area from the state. On my right senator pan on my left senator McCarty both representing Sacramento state in the legislature. And on my far left center Allen -- A member of the Senate from southern California former chair of the Senate Education Committee. So prior to this hearing we all of us participated in tours of the campus in different select areas we heard. A few minutes ago from center pan on the four year graduation. Rate issue and we're gonna hear a lot more from the testimony in just a couple minutes. We are from Senate assembly member McCarty about basic needs in the new food pantry here at Sacramento state certainly a point of pride to have it. That it comes in an uncomfortable moment because so many students are -- Not not able to get some basic food needs met and that's the the advantage of having that the pantry here -- And then of course the area of mental health and senator Allen and I I got a chance to tour -- The the well the student health and counseling service center it's very impressive by you know bill. From student fees -- Trying to treat the whole student and it's a it's a very impressive. Solidity no one of the fax -- Unfortunate facts about student life and our colleges today. Is that 16% of the students at the state university system all twenty three campuses 16% -- Receive some sort of psychological counseling or treatment on campuses last year. Extinguish sent. And when we went through the the well here this morning and we got the facts about how many students are treated it's a it's a large number that's great over thirty thousand students have visited the what the well Saturday. At to deal with that urgent care needs -- Medical needs medicines and certainly counseling. And and when the survey to understand what was the number one reason for visiting. At the top issue. Was depression and anxiety. Depression and anxiety. And I and I have learned Jeff both in my previous services a trustee of the state universities and as a parent -- Date if you have a student that is a struggling -- And stressed out for whatever reason. That it could it could really stop complete stop. There at their education. Is that things aren't together whatever it is -- Sometimes you just can't go to that class and you can't take that test. And unfortunately statewide the ability of a student to be seen quickly -- Is very very poor. In some cases up to three weeks think about that you're in a state of crisis. And it takes you three weeks to get a point. But one of the purposes of our college tour is is to learn. At where things are going right. And we want to celebrate that and with things aren't doing so well I mean one apartment trying to make it better. But I'm really pleased to hear in my my visits with the leadership of the counseling center that if you're a student here at Sacramento state. And you're in crisis that someone is going to be able to see you that day. That's the model that they've created -- They called it the the urgent care. A model. That I it's not just about getting an appointment where you can sit down for an hour. If it's someone struggling that day whether it's balancing your bank account. Or being stressed out about a class that here at Sacramento state you can see you can meet with somebody and talk that issue through. Immediately. And it's very impressive and I hope the tape take the model that you've used to do that because it hasn't come necessarily with more money. But with their adjustment of how you deal with. These types of mental health. And counseling challenges I know we're gonna hear from some of your leadership about that. But there were seven thousand visits here at Saks State. Opera counseling. And while it seems like a lot. You know that they're getting taken care of means that. It's going to affect so many other things to talk about the whole person. And the ability to stay in school. And that's gonna be reflected a graduation rates -- And low debt and all kinds of other things that relate. To that help with that that was very impressive to me I know there's other things to say in a debrief. About trying to tap into the resources center Allen anything you wanted to add to that before we begin how. Well I you know wanted to obviously thank everyone for helping to put all this together at yeah I don't know if anyone saw but the lead story in the Sacramento bee. Is office basically the findings of a of a very -- Contemporary recent you see Berkeley study that shows that anxiety depression and stress among college students are at epidemic. Levels. And the two major issues at the the article the report cites is. The extraordinary amount of data. And financial security that students are currently dealing with you have a lot of folks coming in from -- Already financially precarious positions and then we make their position even more precarious by just. You know how asking them to finance a a public education or education. That's the first thing the second thing interestingly. Is. Social media -- Phones. Computers the extent to which we are isolating ourselves in ways that previous generations have not. It's interesting this generation is physically safer. Because bye bye bye mentally -- More insecure because folks are so. Delved in to the world -- The virtual world. And and it leads to a whole series of of psychological challenges mental challenges. That were all scrambling to try to help address. On the financial side of course. You know we're all working on trying to improve the situation I you know some of the bill ideas were brought up -- You know one of these I'd love to work on is it. Yeah tax write off for since our tax credit for de. For student debt. I love to work with these numbers on on that -- Wiener it's integration I working on better coordination. And data collection associated with our higher educational systems that we can do a better job. Of understanding the needs of students today and and having better articulation through the K. to twelve system the cal state and when. Houses do twenty going to grad school elsewhere how do we help make that system work better. Then of course -- You try to reduce costs in general -- And have really strong health infrastructure in place and I was I was impressed to see -- The the extent to which the well is is really stepped up I love the fact that even grades with physical health and on the other wall and all that the cold -- I've you know. Worked out facilities that are there also the fact that mental health counseling and and some of the other more traditional medical care is in the same place. As one of things we talk about the tour is that there's a quite a stigma associated with. Getting counseling -- But if you go to the ER nobody you know there's no stigma associated with I don't know if you got a hi you have some sort of minor -- Physical ailment that needs addressing -- It's it's nice not to have to say -- Counseling over there. You know. Other types of care over here that that's something that sometimes lead students did not want to go into the counseling room because they're a little. Yeah they're they're worried about the stigma their little bit Joel sheepish about it so integrating man understanding that there is a health and wellness nexus that is so strong and so important for us to understand. Was great now it really is a reflection of kind of best practices in the field so. You know I'm we're all struggling to help make the system work better for young people we have not made it easy I mean it is just extraordinary to me how much. I think about my parents' generation and the extent to which society stepped up to provide. Low cost high quality public education for them and how we have just eaten away at that promise that is inherent master plan over the decades. It is such a shame is such a it does such an injustice to the next generation and also doesn't it just as to what to us as a society because a really does the track from. Students ability to grow and thrive once they get out of school and start a business and buy a house and build a family and all the kinds of things that we associate with the American dream self -- That's part of why we're here tomorrow I was part of this committee and and and and just try to learn in fact finding try to get information from you. So that we can help to promote better policies that will -- Will assist you on the ground here on this campus enough with. Great thank you center Allen so let's let's begin with our for our first panel like to invite app -- The following that in fact you know who you are so come on up here and sit down and I'll introduce you so president Nelson come on joy in the well and said rock completes comes to death. Please come join us yeah. And we're gonna live. We're gonna someone. We're gonna start with that with the president Nelson -- Hi. It's it's somewhat argue you know we finish a legislative career what did you do that really mattered or not mattered but it's arguable that maybe the most important thing I ever did. Was service the chair of the presidential selection committee here in Sacramento state -- And would together with my colleagues on the board of trustees -- Selected that Robert Nelson to be your president here in Sacramento. And it may be the most important decision I've ever made because of the great job that you are doing Sir. And it's been a pleasure to to follow -- Your leadership. Over the last two years and and making a big difference I know there's a lot of things you're very excited about that are happening here we're gonna hear from. In a moment but we thank you for your graciousness and having that Senate simply here -- On the campus and we look forward to hearing your thoughts about these important issues of basic needs and and that'll help them. Graduation and all the rest of president Nelson walk. It's an honor to address you today thank you for coming de sac state senators and assemblyman carting. We are honored to have you here and we're honored to be able to show you a little bit about our campus and what we're trying to do -- When you did hire me? I open up the hood of the car and we showed everybody what was inside and that was an 8% graduation rate. I'm very proud to say that we are currently at a fourteen point 7%. And just making that small change if you do back of the envelope. Numbers it's saved our students ninety three million dollars they would have to pay intuition just making that little change we are now predicting that we will be at 21%. In the September of this year that's a four year graduate as a four year graduation rate. We've already broken all of the other moves as far as it goes were 10% higher than the system thought we were going to be in twenty twenty five four or four years -- For six year graduation rates and we're just moving forward how did we do it we added a thousand new classes we could never added those thousand new classes without the help of the legislature. The graduation initiative gave us the money to be able to add those classes. That thousand classes cost six point two million dollars. With out the graduation initiative we would not have been there. We then added a hundred and seventy seven new faculty we added advisors and we are moving the needle. For but it's not about graduating in four years as you said it's about having the opportunity to graduate in four years. Many students will not. Will never be a 100% graduation for years will never be 70% graduation M. for years we care about all of our students. And that means we have to care about their mental health and we have to care about what they are doing and how they're moving forward. We care about the students who are homeless the ramp. In Sacramento. Keeps going up we know that. So even with the cal grants we're never going to be able to help on all those ways there. Are maybe Jean C. housing program has six beds in it students can come and stay there for up to thirty days that's not a lot of beds but it makes a difference and we're working with everybody around here. In the area to help the students the student emergency grant. Which often prevents homelessness a student can go in and get something maybe it's for a higher that's out maybe it's for medicines that they can't afford. Maybe it's for rent that there maybe it's that book that they just couldn't get. We've got Ted grant and their their over a hundred students signed up for cal grant. How fresh this year already so we're trying to provide as many services we can? We have our counselors not only in the well that you saw today. But also in engineering also in the dreamers resource center also it in athletics so that they can be out there and help in every place that we can. This next year we're going to add one in Lassen hall which is this one stop center for our students so we care about the students we care about them being successful. I have a great. Group of in people of panel it's going to come up. You'll see how honest are. And how much they really do care because we are a Hornet family so thank you for having us here today. And I'm sorry but I better do stingers up. At present Nelson thank you for that sharing at the that great progress eight from 8% four year graduation rate 214%. Last year with the with the hope and belief it's going. To go up assembly member ID I do have a question need in this year's C. S. U. budget. They there is -- Scott fifteen million dollars for some these basic needs initiatives. And it's it's one time unfortunately. Ironically the C. S. you see -- Budget item is the same fifteen but on going so. We were trying to make that I'm going which would be of course nice for the C. C. system twenty three campuses. If the what's the difference what you can do one time verses on going in other words are there. You can get I'm I'm sure the I know the answer but you know ongoing initiatives and you can -- Have. Some -- Consistency and in finding knowing that that can be viable year after year. I'm going money means that we can hire people that will be here to provide services on going okay you can't hire people on one time money. You can hire him for a few months. But then you just hiring adjuncts or something like that and that is what we want to do we will we will put the money that if it is one time into programs we'll put it into counseling sessions we'll put it into improving the pantry even. More than what we're doing well add some beds but it will be short term. So we very much want to have on going sounds. Great trying to make that happen thank you. He's the guy I know that in the assembly. All right -- Let you hang tight we're gonna hear from a couple other folks -- Joys Stewart James -- Exact it is the executive director of the student health and counselling services joy. Thank you for your leadership -- And such an important area with forty hearing your remarks. Good morning thank you so much for taking the time -- To see a facilities and what what what we're trying to work on towards our students -- One of the things that -- We try to do about eight years ago we tried to shift our focus from being what we would consider a illness driven or response kind of model to a much more proactive holistic -- Approach to providing services and over the last -- Really eight years we look for ways to integrate -- To give you some numbers -- Eight years ago roughly 2222% of our student population was accessing the health center and less than center -- We've grown 55258% of our student population routinely accesses our health center services. And 7210% access our counseling services. And through that approach we've had to really -- Broaden our efforts on prevention screening prevention and early intervention and five years ago we began we decided that the top presenting problems when we looked at the medical side and we looked at the counseling side. To anxiety and depression were in the top five for both and it was at that point that we said you know we're treating the same patients we need to have a much more coordinated approach on how we do this. So we began screening and we screen our students for depression on the medical side. And really through a grant -- The cal mesa grand we establish the urgent care model which was one where students either presenting -- For distress or those that scored high on the depression screening are in fact seen -- That day that. Immediately -- From that we began looking at other data and found that 30% of our student population only really needs one counseling appointment so just this fall we implemented single session visits which will allow some students. To come in for more problem solving kinds of things so -- It's as as she center Allen mention those of the issues the demand -- Continues we have to continue to look -- For ways to change our service delivery on how we provide services to students -- And expand -- You know the number of programs -- That we have. The the more recent thing we did this fall that I think -- Is is interesting it is we adopted the screening program that many -- Healthcare facilities are using which is identifying food and security. So all of our students that come into the health center our screen for food and security this fall. We I just have the phone numbers and we screen -- To over roughly shy of four thousand students and 31% of those students -- Were screened as possible for food and security and so we were able to do an immediate referral over to the cares office and get the students connected -- With cow freshen the food pantry and so I think that's a great way for us all to be working together to early identify students that might not go to the pantry initially but come to the health center -- So we're continually looking for ways for us to cross can -- Collaborate on those things. That thank you joy joy and thank you could. C. L. what a beautiful facility you have to work with their so I know that's just part of the issue -- In terms a terrified and they care that **** that we all want to provide. I I I noted that the lesson is here the dean of students. And you have a big portfolio here on campus and go way beyond just -- Mental health and and healthcare services but at what's going well what's not going so well what can you share with us. Thank you good morning I'm. I I. frequently side of I'm very commonly discussed C. S. T. wide -- Study that was done I'm sure you're all familiar with it -- It's projected that C. S. U. wide approximately forty one point 6% of students reported experiencing food and security in the past twelve months -- Over twenty one point six of those students reported very low access to food. Additionally ten point 9% of students reported experiencing homelessness in the past twelve months those are staggering numbers when we think about. The the enormity of our system and we're certainly seeing those those numbers bear out here at Sacramento state. Some of the things that we do to address this crisis and a number of years ago I'd say probably five or six years ago we we surveyed and students who left school. After the first year -- Stopped out we noticed that the vast majority of them were in good academic standing most people assume that if students left school it was because they found out. That wasn't the case so we we sent out an exit survey of all this to all the students who'd left to ask why did they leave what what went wrong if their grades were were okay. And what they overwhelmingly said the top number. On the top reason that students left school after their first year work was physical hardship financial hardship. So we wrap our heads around that problem a little bit and and we ask more questions in the financial hardships weren't that large we're not talking about thousands of dollars that the students were missing we're talking about sometimes just a few. Hundred so that so a couple of years and into my time here we instituted something called in at the student emergency grant it's now called the Robert us next Nelson. Student emergency grant. I'm not grant was established to help students when when they've experienced some kind of crisis that forced them to make a choice between continuing in school. Or or addressing the problem -- Or paying their rent or eating that month no one should have to make that choice. So. Not for five years ago we instituted the emergencies grant is really our first step in a long line of services that we've since created. To address these kinds of issues for our students and keep them in school and keep them I'm working toward their goals. Shortly after the emergency grant was instituted we created our emergency housing program. Doctor Nelson pointed out that we have six spends on campus they're always full so we've seen so every year we see approximately fifty students who stay on campus for approximately thirty days as emergency stopgap housing while they C. case manager to secure a longer term. Resources in addition there are some students who aren't able to stay on campus maybe they have a dependent -- Maybe they have a small child in a residence hall is inappropriate for them so we instituted an agreement with a local motel for for housing vouchers to supplement. So that all of our students can be equally served. Joy mentioned the the wonderful partnership we have with student health and counselling the screening her her screening. Program has referred to a great number of students we project that over two hundred and fifty of those students will have been registered for cal French fresh services this year. To your point. Assembly member McCarty that's that's teaching to fish instead of giving the fish for the day. We also provide. Have an annual clothing drive for students and we provide financial coaching. So it's very difficult to make a small number of dollars stretch but we work with our students to teach them all sorts of ways. To make the most of the resources that they have access. To I think the thing that that. I'm most excited about is our comprehensive case management services. So a little over three years ago we had the the ability to bring on a very talented case manager from from our community. And the reason this became a game changer is because the office the cares office that you toward this morning became a single point of contact for students. Many of whom are are suffering from multiple challenges at once not just one they don't fit neatly into one of these services when when you experience one challenge I'm sure you know he experienced several. And so the the students for the who are the most impacted the students who have. The most complex issues are able to see one person who can unpack all of the different issues an axe to help them to access the many different resources that they may sometimes need. In order to get things put in place in order for them to continue to be successful and fed and housed. In that office -- If you have an opportunity to see it we have lockers because sometimes homeless students need to make use of our of our local shelters. And sometimes they're free to do that because they they may worry about theft of a laptop or if they're expensive textbooks so we have lockers for students to be able to lock their valuables and in order. To to be as resourceful as they can to meet their housing needs we have mailboxes so that if your if your housing is in securing you don't have a permanent mailing address. You have the opportunity to get your mail so that some of the services that have been put in place don't get cut off because you missed an important notice. These students are followed throughout the year. They're given every resource available and I'm happy to say that even though they're some of the most complicated situations that we encounter on campus. They haven't over over 87% of them continue to stay in school or graduate at the end of each semester. And those are the most complicated cases that we see so we know this model works we know that it's helping people to stay in school and we know that it's helping people. To achieve a brighter future thank you for all of your support because the S. B. eighty five funds were funds that were used. To create the cares space and everything that Senate today so we thank you for your support. And the evidence of your investment in our students by being here in engaging with us in this conversation. Thank you I. D. lease and that. It's great to hear about your case management work and the impact that can have on on the whole student and and certainly the emergency grants in the housing vouchers and clothing drive in the financial literacy all those things are. Really add up to a big number. In keeping kids in school and keeping them focused. On their degree attainments and then. All that that leads to so -- Great leadership we really appreciate it. And we appreciate all your insight any questions before we continue with our okay. Let. Me invite that -- No well mora the president of the Sacramento state associate students -- You have a a challenging job. I know because I used to be in that job forty years ago -- State university but hopefully you're having fun to but we appreciate your insight. And your commitment to your your fellow students and look for here testing like this morning. Thank you welcome. Well thank you and good morning to all of you senators and assembly members that are here. Actually gonna take the Mike -- And I want to thank my fellow panelists and really all of the students that are -- Here today too because it is an overwhelming timing for that same reason I think you -- For visiting and and really listening to our student concerns as they relate to student basic needs it shows your leadership and for that I think you. I think it's important really to begin by setting an overview of our student needs. And as Beth mentioned we know that about 10% of our students system wide. Were -- Don't know where they're going to sleep in any given night -- Whether that means that their couch surfing. Where they're out right homeless? We know that about 47% of our students here at sac state which is higher than the system wide average experience exile eighteen over where they're going to whether they're going to have a full meal or any meal at all. At the end of that day. That's not conducive to sitting in a classroom and going through an academic experience. We know that our students are visiting the counselors at our help center for mental wellness at high rates during high stress periods like exam weeks and at various points throughout the year of course. The fact that most of our students are working students is really no coincidence when looking at these statistics. It's true that life can get to be especially hectic for our students with competing responsibilities that include -- Working those multiple jobs maintaining academic achievement and engaging in professional activities that are needed to meet the demands of the present day work force. Times have changed. Not to mention that most students are local and contribute to helping their families and communities as well. So this makes accessing resources like the S. I. food pantry -- Not only helpful but critical to student success retention and graduation. We know that students utilizing our pantry are often feeding multiple people. And we're appreciative of the money set aside for basic needs in the governor's budget Because we really need it. The pantry saw six thousand visits so far this year. Ten thousand people have been fed by those visits. In this week alone since we opened re opened our food pantry here in our university union. We have seen three hundred and forty student visits just this week alone. Our highest months all 110030% -- Increase from the previous year. And if Dodd doesn't demonstrate the need and the impact of these resources. I really don't know what else does. As our campus First Lady Jody Nielsen set herself this situation is bittersweet. Because it's good to see students are being supported. But it should also not mean that the scenario is one that we're stuck with in perpetuity. I have said this for a while but these are basic needs after all. There should be a point where we start focusing on more than the base minimum and start to allow for resources from the campus community whether it's from a desire from another local entity. To go towards high impact practices like study abroad -- Aid and summered for state. We know that this is going to put our students on an equal playing field. And we have to start thinking ahead towards again those things that come beyond. I recognize that there's a hierarchy of needs but public higher education. After all be publicly funded and through a holistic approach which is why work. Again. Very very thankful and honored that this conversation is happening. Now I don't mean to sound like I'm running for an officer giving some generic speech but this is what I really believe after representing our students for the past two years. Is that a significant number of our students -- For pop you are vulnerable population within our state. I really do think that students are Holyoke vulnerable population we're a microcosm of our state this is largely due to the rising cost of living and the rising cost of a public higher education. And it goes to the fact that we know that state investment in the CSU is comparatively lower than a couple of decades ago. And amidst competing funding priorities we're now in a situation. For student basic needs have become a crisis point in our society. The thing is you did basic needs are California's basically it's just magnified due to circumstance which I've mentioned. This is an intersecting issue and I hope that we can all see that. And as we sit here I'm thinking of the student parent that's looking for emergency housing and can't be placed in a shared room. I'm thinking of the undocumented students who is too afraid to ask for support and file forms with their information on it. I'm thinking of so many students who feel the sense of urgency after sleeping in their cars or showering out origin. California's university must serve California and that's why I'm hopeful that sharing some of the students stories with you today here at sac state. Will help engaging the magnitude of this problem. I look forward to hearing more student voices. And again I thank you for your willingness to listen even if this conversation may sometimes seem predictable repetitive I promise you it is neither. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Mister Moore a great testimony -- The facts the facts are are stunning six thousand visits to the food pantry this year. And certainly -- Your bill your belief that student basic needs are in a crisis point is something that I think all of us share I think that's why we're here. So we appreciate your leadership and your voice and all this thank you thank you very much. Next I want to invite. Sidra -- Mukhtar my pronouncing your name right okay a student here at Sacramento state who has some experiences to share with us welcome [inaudible] Thank you. Good morning -- I am a fourth year student here at Sacramento state I was a thirty three point eight GPA student -- With four consecutive semesters on the dean's honors list I came into my college career with twelve units on my transcript for my college units -- But then all change in my junior year -- I come from a lot of financial privilege but also a lot of abuse. So when I decided to stand up against my abuser and leave I was left with nothing. No food no place to stay and transportation her job and very little money despite all of this the university supported me and all of these areas with job referrals donated bike and cell phone. A place an emergency housing access to the dining Commons M. A. S. I. food pantry and help with applying to cal fresh. All of these Alonso weekly meetings with Daniel Monning is one of our case managers to assess my immediate and changing needs. At three point eight GPA dean's on our list student how also hope I felt like a complete failure. As paralyzed with fear after an incident of stalking harassment from my abuser here on campus. So I stopped attending classes he gave himself farm how lost sight of the day I graduate. The people at this university including Daniel Monning aus that's less than and also anything right. Just to name a few. Fully supported me through all of that as provided with information of resources in the community like we've and my sister's house. Received an emergency fund from the university I was connected with someone in the community community for housing after the spring semester what and last year. This whole thing counseling services listen to what I have to say about my mental health. After my own doctors in the community rejected and stigmatize the word that came out of my mouth. This university help me when the greater Sacramento community let me down it's so easy to tell our students. To go find a job be responsible and pull themselves out of their basic needs struggles but you know what a full time student with a part time job working nights to talk about. And then riding their bike home at three in the morning is that going to get them very far. Employers give too little errors to their students employees and the housing market is beyond reach for at many young adults try to make it through school without financial support from their family. I've been emergency housing twice now. I was I received the find. To make their own needs me. I to make their own -- Ends meet when it comes to housing and community members who agree to house you don't want you coming home at three in the morning from your seven hour shift that talk about. So they tell you that it's not working out anymore and then you find yourself back at the mercy of the university. I was going to take time off from school to work at talk about so that I could afford my rent and other bills and today here I am. Eighteen units away from graduating no longer facing academic probation and slowly resuscitating my GPA for graduate school. I could have easily fallen Tom thought minimum wage tropical but I didn't. Because of the people here the sacrament Steve Kerr's office if I. food pantry and health and counseling services. Now I can finally keep working on my degree go to law school and get back to the community by advocating for marginalized groups. And I think that my story is a penny of author Allen -- Brown's plastic saying that you cannot pour from an empty vessel thank you [inaudible] By. Did read thank you for sharing your story it's the powerful story. You were one strong person And yeah out of this difficulty and at eighteen minutes you're almost there. I know you're gonna you're gonna stay committed to it and you've overcome so much and what's most interesting. About your story is that if we look back on it twenty years From now -- I hope that you will say that -- It has made you stronger more insightful. A more powerful advocate for those who share the same experiences that you have here because they're not unique you know. There's a lot of students who -- I Robert having this same kinds of challenges that you will become very very difficult ones -- And that. At at at at that spiral into a very difficult place on housing on food all the things that you have shared with us and I I feel the power -- In your testimony and you. And it gives me great confidence that twenty years from now we're gonna be celebrate your leadership. So many ways so we can't give thanks for sharing that story. We we want to invite. Other students here who have come maybe just to listen and and that. React maybe they have value come with a message that experiences that you have had but we want to invite you to share your your thoughts with us here and in this hearing.

You all for being here and for listening at the for participating so he tells you not tell us your name but you up with us your first name. Also check that microphone I don't hear anything there is there to on and off switch we can double check on hold on one second. Right one more time. There you go hi my name's Tammy Lynn and I'm a current psychology major here at fox date. And I am. Honored to be a student here I'm formerly incarcerated and I'm former foster use I grew up in the system and when I transferred to sac state I was almost out of financial aid because I had. Basically taught myself to learn to read and write and had. To had to tighten up those skills and community college so when I got here. I had about a year left a financial aid and if it weren't for the cal grants in the university grants. I wouldn't have. Even been able to start. And within about two years I was facing homelessness and I was at a point where. I was going to have to leave school because I couldn't afford the seven or eight hundred dollars extra -- On top of the grant to stay in school every semester. And I started reaching out and found guardian scholars program and project rebound. And without those programs I wouldn't be in school today graduating in just a few weeks. And and this campus has been like a home to me and I really just want to say that I have utilized the pantry many times and still to this day I get my food from a food bank because I am on SSI disability and I'm not allowed to get -- Cal works of what is it called the the help right for food they won't give it to us. So when I have forty dollars and left every month for groceries many times I have to spend out on gas to get to school. And I would rather do that because school is so important to me. It's it's my life I have almost a three point five GPA and I've maintained that through. Every single struggle that I've gone through and I have raised my grandchildren on my own -- I also. An abusive relationship and gone through many other things. And I just want to say that -- I am so grateful for you guys on what you're doing for it for us because without -- Making some changes there there's a lot of us out here that. We we can't afford tuition it's but I can't afford not to go to school. Because of the impact that you know because of a life I came from I need my education I want to be able to get back to my community. I want to help other students I just applied for a job in the cares office and I'm train every day I get it. I want to be that one person that can help people like me -- I'm I'm so grateful for you guys please keep doing what you're doing I I couldn't be here without you thank you Tammy wow. Another student that's overcome so many challenges and weeks away from graduating you've made. M. great choices and then in the midst of very hard choices to get that degree and to get that this year your career and your future adhesive. Graduations. Thank you over here. A go so my name is Quinn -- I'm an art student here at sac state -- I'm born and raised in Stockton California and moved up to Sacramento -- Three years ago now and I'm. The first person in my family to pursue a college education. And yeah yes one six thanks for the work the doing because it. Doesn't matter -- I think the arts are really important part of the Sacramento community and I think that -- There's still a lot to be done in terms of growing sac state into the Sacramento archimedean think that. Is something that's an ongoing thing that I'm. You know hopefully gonna. Do when I graduate this fall -- Mom when you're off from a from a four year graduation plan but I think that's a lot you know pretty solid. It's a during I started as a computer science student at eighty year that and then I switched over to your yeah so I think that. The the plan that you have. For discussing in an evaluating mental illness is a part of being. A student is really important -- Some of the experiences that I've had in the in the arts here at sac state -- I made specifically new media work on computers networking computer lab. This semester I'm taking -- Three different studio classes. It's de a class is three hours long so some of my Tuesdays are twelve hours because here on campus doing work but I love that one and I'm really happy that I'm doing it just because I get to work on these just. Doing what I'm passionate about -- Also part time employee here at sac state and this community is not a lot for me -- When I came up here? Four years ago I didn't know why I was here why I was seeking a college education was just. What I was told to do? But I taken steps because of this community. To understand why I'm here and why I am doing. And why it's important -- So I want to thank you for the going work the you doing to to value we thank thank you when thank you. Are you in the Mike. Yeah go ahead yeah. Hello everyone my name is -- Flores and I am a going into my last year at Sacramento state I'm a communications major -- If this is in public affairs -- I do want to thank you guys for all like for being your first and foremost -- Also want to thank you for all the work that you guys do at the state level -- I think it's very important -- Especially advocating for all kinds of students not -- To the group -- So I really use like. Officially like the yes I would pan Jim but I do know students that have gone in and use the they are able to get food and like. You know my brother help press and be able to receive all that money -- In order to like make it through whether it's a month or you know the next month but I give them kind of a little bit less -- Anxiety or kind of they're going through some kind of stress -- For me. My first a little bit more different because I'm a transfer student -- After I graduated high school I went to the meeting Holly spurs and I communicable is I was never really involved -- I didn't really know how to or I didn't know the like and what to get involved in or or I didn't really see. Any kind of like anything for me you know I mean so. So a committee college I didn't really get involved -- Actually de I stopped going to committee college because my family was going to a financial hardship -- It was only me my sister my mom so that was kind of one of the hardest parts of my life was -- My mom was working like two jobs -- My fishes finishing high school -- I'm trying to work. Part Wilk full time and full time student which was really you know really hard for me because I was a child my mom out. With pan around her bills -- And things like that so that was I was a financial hardship that we went there was actually dropped out of school for about a year. And it was. Interesting because I got to see the perspective of light will my wife could be at if I didn't you know come back to school -- I saw myself I was working in the construction zone -- I don't think I mentioned it but I am with -- Doctor students I am a dreamer -- So I was facing like on top of everything that I was facing like I have Bates -- Just like. Everything else with the country -- Because I was brought here when I was like four years old and it was not like it's not like I had -- A say in the light coming to the US is just you know my parents ended up bringing here -- For a better life [inaudible] So -- Once I saw my life in the construction zone you know my body was really deteriorating I was actually doing a demolition. So it was just like. Our word we can about like where I am coming back home at like six PM then literally eating and then go back to sleep -- But I did that for about a year. And I saw my wife and I was like. You know I don't do this forever I don't want to do this for all they need to go back to school -- I went back to college finished of any college. Thanks a and honestly like I say like. I one of the best things I've ever done in my life -- I want to think like all the back until the staff on and any student there's now it's like. Of the five stages provides that like. W. I. N. even like I'm from Sacramento on like even when Mike I'm not at home like I'm a home here. And like for me like I spend SXT like at least. Like on a day to you know bouncing on my classes my work -- Socializing probably get fourteen hours a day so like get here around -- Either seven AM. Zero eight PM I don't know whatever time but I just want to say like. The the program they really help me out with a dream research centering on campus -- When I transferred over I really had no idea on? On a lot of things -- Just. I was kind of going into a long so once I came in -- The Jim research center actually really helped me out into. A whether it's financial aid it was getting -- I actually got. I didn't apply for the the hooting Rampone for the one that says they but I did apply to the dream research center they have their own personal -- One so they did help me in order to get paper schools for the first semester. I think that was really. Like I was really grateful that they were able to do that for me -- The only thing that I want to say like I hope you guys take into consideration -- Those next wave of students are going to be coming in -- Because we don't know that right now like as does the United States like the policy Bob like they're not accepting new recipients for the doctor dreamers the so. All those -- Like students are gonna be coming in. Into a light. Whether they want to go to college or not like they might not have the opportunity because like they're not accepting -- The like the the mac applications so in order to do receive you make you must have like a five five bill I'm. I believe and if you're not like receiving any financial aid then like all those new wave of students that. Are not able to apply propelled rounds they're not able -- To get like scholarship defining for them just because technically they're undocumented -- Compared to me where I'm I'm a little bit you know I'm really grateful that I do have this opportunity to to be able to apply and get most of it paid although I don't get it all but just want to say like. Just take into consideration rails -- The students -- And thank you for everything there is to thank you Israel thank you thanks for sharing your story. Okay here yes. Hi good morning my name is in him again I'm a fourth year here at Saks dot tell me your name again. Yeah yeah okay -- As a student has struggled with basic needs I wanted to mention that there is a proposal. In the legislative for twenty million an ongoing fines for rapid re housing for college students that students would let me support on and then also I had a question for stern remember McCarty. So I don't know. Yeah he had to get to a budget hearing actually. When you can ask your question will pass it on to him okay so my question basically was -- That he mentioned he has a bill I work for financial aid and help solve the problem students are facing with the total cost of attendance. How will that will solve the specific issue? Rate will pass I don't know the answer to that I will pass it on to him. Thank you Cynthia okay yes Sir. Hi my name is Jeremiah merece I'm graduating in two weeks with a masters of public policy administration I just wanted to briefly discuss some policies. I'm also currently serving as a research assistant to UC regent Michael Cohen. So I've been studying basic needs for him for the last few months and so I wanted to share some of the things I've learned at the UC is doing that's also relevant to this issue and community colleges so -- It's not the same Mike it is yeah remember doctor finance mobile going. Not Donald trump's microphone right. Norris so. So I think that we need to continue working to get the cal fresh application into the financial aid process on the way we're signing up students. Finding a legibility up front. And we need to continue working that until we can instill that federally under a different administration when it becomes more friendly to do -- I think that's something that we need our state leaders to push the next secretary of education. Under democratic -- Leadership to do -- I think next is. Once we are able to scale up how fresh we need to be able to make sure our counties have the capability to do it some counties have outdated software systems aren't able to do it others just don't have the manpower political well. That's something I've seen through the U. sees that they've experienced a couple of counties. So -- They think. Moreover we've been consistent baseline of services the UC is trying to deal with this right and that right now in their funding allocation -- I think that. Last week's L. airport one basic needs for the U. sees -- The governor's proposed budget on it. It rightly points out the inconsistent inconsistency unfairness between community colleges and C. issues with what the C. issues down so far. A granite they've got their research models and everything but we need to make sure we get those baseline services up across the board. Especially because of the need this disproportionate me -- And lastly housing is by far the biggest challenge that we face in the whole state facing it. And I think that if you're all about. Finding efficiency in the state dollars you start looking at off campus shared housing between the systems. So some of our communities across the state. Those opportunities exist Sacramento San Diego bay area. You could put off campus housing in west Iraq. Into the transportation network being students to Sacramento and also to Davis into Los Rios. As well so so I can use to exist I would like to see you guys great weather. You can also use the **** to facilitate that because cancel government government's yes great you're Mike thank you thanks for being here thank Yes ma'am. Hello -- Thank you for the opportunity. To talk to you guys. A young lady reporter and everything inside of me and your story is completely inspiring and thank you for sharing your story -- For myself -- I would like to think that I'm not your typical student -- High school drop out -- Get your diploma at twenty one teenage mother -- Starting school in your thirties -- On every subsidized program that they have to offer -- When I came I'm a transfer student -- When I started school at the -- Junior college -- I didn't really go to graduate but yet here I am -- I was encouraged to come to Saks state. My first semester was. To say the least -- What I wanted to expand this story at -- Amazing yet. Tremendously scary a semester -- I start off this semester. Before the semester even started I found out I had breast cancer so I had to go through this whole surgery thing and I was like I'm. One I came this far nothing's gonna breast cancer is not gonna stop me that was my attitude -- So -- Needless to say -- I went to the and when I went to that process -- We work financially ready. To to to to go through the medical issues that -- I had I will I'm on that and the sacramental -- Section eight program and so my income with my rate was low at the time. When I decide to come back to school I had to pick up extra jobs and so I worked a lot to try to catch up for all those bills? That was behind so -- When it was time to submit my income they said -- Good you can pay more rent and they went from. Four hundred to fourteen hundred and it within a month a couple of months I had to figure out how to pay that we although I didn't have the income to do that which landed me in a position where -- León homeless was a threat -- That wouldn't have been the first time I've been homeless before but I don't need to go back that far this is curry -- Currently -- I'm in the process of trying to figure out how. To fight to have policies changed because I have friends that's going to transfer here in their mothers with children and you know we have to work and we're not your average still naked take fifteen units we you know some of us have to take six units. Four nine units on the I'm on twelve units right now and I'm just like Diane what's your major life what's your major -- For my bachelors degree my goal is deaf studies -- I started sign language at the junior college -- And I have a whole purpose in the rhyme and reason for that but I'm here now doing that Margolis social work for my masters degree. And currently when the mind frame that I would love to get my doctorate degree I decided that when I was here. You might not agree in sociology but you know that I'm being led by whatever you know whatever way the wind blows but I'm going to keep pushing -- I said all I have to say is -- I don't know what policies and it was interesting to see Richard pan because I was actually going to reach out to his office this week -- What policies they have for a transition -- Currently there's really not a transition if you're on section eight if you're on how works if you're on snap on food stamps. You -- You start off at a certain level and when you say I'm trying to work to do a little better they say. You can do it yourself and they kind of cut off the system. Are there are there the way their policies is set up they just kind of cut to offer they around from you know like they did with me for four seventy four to fourteen hundred with no transition. And I would like to know -- From -- While the rich enough his office but you guys -- As well how do we eliminate that because every single time I think about quitting college everything inside of me falls apart and I do struggle with depression and anxiety and whenever I think about that -- It it. That's what it does to me yeah because I became so far and I don't give that. Card to to to have to quit because I cannot financially afford anything -- God has placed me in the in the in the hands of the right people -- The care program with Danielle and there's listen all the M. that kinda like no we're all you're not going to quit you're not gonna give out we have these programs the O. P. program we have these programs that will help you. Get through -- And and just for the one time offering you know to help me catch up on my the eight hour notice is in my car insurance is that's canceling my registration. For while I'm trying to go to school and maintain my four point oh for my first semester god knows I'm just like how my gonna get a four point oh this semester because so many things is going on so -- I would like to know and it would be also Mike nice to know what the college my how do you help with that transition period when you're trying to work as a student. You're just trying to make ends meet but they tell you make too much you know and so I just want thank you for the opportunity. And is really good thanks for coming and sharing your story. That's that's that's persistence and I hope that it's always stay strong and stay strong you come so far. And and it's only gonna get better even though these are big challenges still and by the way your normal to be stressed okay. We get stressed hi we have one last speaker and then we're gonna go out and see the fair that's outside. The focus is on some of these issues but hello welcome and but hi my name is our shells are -- First what is what is it thank you so much for being here and listening to you know all those students are here. I think for me growing up -- Education was. Going to school was where I felt the most liberated. For me it was a liberating experience -- I don't really understand -- The depth of a financial turbulence until I came to succeed -- But I think that we have such a wonderful Hornet family here. Thank you so much Daniel windows for doing the work that you do. Thank you so much for creating and and working with all. Trying to come out all these different charges that we're we're facing. I'm you know I spent the last about six seven months just. Kind of speaking and and serving students and listening to the concerns because it's such a a part of who I am right now -- I I did want to just take out the time to say this to students because I sometimes we don't -- We think that we're not enough like this upcoming month I will be able to pay my rent. You just call shipped out I receive through inside -- And I'm not a four point oh student I've actually just been struggling immensely for the last. Year and a half -- Due to not being able to find a job but I think that we have. So much in please and in service to help students like me -- But it but what but I did want to point and see this thought. The financial aid -- System unfortunately is a broken system right we we protect our buttons but we don't protect our students -- Students coming here shouldn't feel and this is actually speaking for traditional and nontraditional students because even if you have families are hoping you -- They're coming out graduating with loans. And I think that the country itself needs. To re write the way education works the financial aid system has. Kind of state same place for last fifty years I think this is what needs to be combat it heavily. Thank you so much thank you thank you. Well [inaudible] Financial. Same in the cost of yeah eighty nine eighty nine thirty is you know we're trying to work on decreasing tuition but I just think you know all everyone being here -- All their struggles like all those matters but thank you so much for everything thank you for sharing your stories at we came to Sacramento state for a reason and it's clear -- As it is anyone who sat through that. This hearing which is that these are all very important.
