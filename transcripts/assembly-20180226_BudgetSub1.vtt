LABORATORY DATA DOESN'T COME

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:19.275 region:rollup2
WITH THAT INFORMATION RIGHT BUT

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:20.843 region:rollup2
BUT I GUESS MY MY. NEXT QUESTION

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:22.478 region:rollup2
WOULD BE IS IF ONLY TWENTY

01:16:20.843 --> 01:16:24.380 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE KIDS ARE BEING

01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:25.981 region:rollup2

THERE BEATEN THEIR TONY TWENTY

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:29.952 region:rollup2
PERCENT. I'M CONFUSED AS TO WHO

01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:31.554 region:rollup2
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:33.556 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT THE KIDS ARE

01:16:31.554 --> 01:16:35.724 region:rollup2

WHEN YOU TEST KITS WERE PROVIDED

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.869 region:rollup2

THOSE TESTS.

01:16:46.869 --> 01:16:48.637 region:rollup2
AND IF THE MONEY IS NOT BEING

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:50.139 region:rollup2
USED FOR TESTING THEN WHERE IS

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:51.574 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY.

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:53.175 region:rollup2
THIS IS WILL WE DO KNOW FROM OUR

01:16:51.574 --> 01:16:55.411 region:rollup2

01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:21.957 region:rollup2
AS SUCH ON OUR WEBSITE WE

CURRENTLY DO HAVE

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:26.929 region:rollup2

JURISDICTION. AGE AND BLOOD LEAD

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:30.499 region:rollup2

IT'S IT'S.

01:19:33.636 --> 01:19:37.006 region:rollup2
FOR CLARIFICATION THE STATUE

DOESN'T SAY.

01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:41.010 region:rollup2
IT'S A BIANNUAL LED LEGISLATIVE

ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:59.995 region:rollup2
PROVIDED ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS

01:19:58.327 --> 01:20:01.263 region:rollup2
WE HAVE?

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:02.164 region:rollup2
SO THE INFORMATION THAT WE

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:04.199 region:rollup2
PROPOSED IS.

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:06.368 region:rollup2
DATA FROM OUR LABORATORY BLOOD

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:08.270 region:rollup2
LEAD TASK.

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:10.306 region:rollup2
SO IT AT A BREAK SADDAM BY EACH

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:12.074 region:rollup2
OF CHILD IN JURISDICTIONS

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:14.643 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE THE COUNTY AND SO THAT

01:20:12.074 --> 01:20:15.878 region:rollup2
IS VERY ACCURATE. I WOULDN'T BE

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:17.546 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PULL.

01:20:15.878 --> 01:20:18.814 region:rollup2
WHAT INSURANCE PLAN THE CHILDREN

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:20.983 region:rollup2
ARE IN BECAUSE WE DON'T WE DON'T

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:22.685 region:rollup2
GET THAT DATA?

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:24.253 region:rollup2
RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:20:22.685 --> 01:20:25.220 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY JUST THE CAN I FOLLOW

01:20:24.253 --> 01:20:27.656 region:rollup2
UP AYE OF. IT.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:29.958 region:rollup2
AGAIN I'M.

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:31.026 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:32.695 region:rollup2
REINFORCE AND SONYA YOU CAN.

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:33.829 region:rollup2
SHAKING HER HEAD AS IF YOU

01:20:32.695 --> 01:20:34.329 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS TRYING TO

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:37.366 region:rollup2
ASK.

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:39.034 region:rollup2
WHO? IS IT THAT I CAN SEPARATE

01:20:37.366 --> 01:20:40.035 region:rollup2
FROM YOU BUT WHO IS IT THAT WE

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:42.237 region:rollup2
CAN GET THAT INFORMATION FROM AN

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:43.739 region:rollup2
AND AND IS THERE ANYTHING THAT

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:45.407 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO TO ENCOURAGE THESE TO.

01:20:43.739 --> 01:20:46.608 region:rollup2
WHOEVER IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:48.377 region:rollup2
THE KIDS ARE BEING TESTED INCOME

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:49.211 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WE WE JUST HAD A BILL

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:51.046 region:rollup2
ON DEAD.

01:20:49.211 --> 01:20:53.716 region:rollup2
AND WATER FOR KIDS AND WE CAN

01:20:51.046 --> 01:20:56.051 region:rollup2
TEST BAD BUT BUT YET WE CAN

01:20:53.716 --> 01:20:58.354 region:rollup2
PROVE WE HAVE.

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:58.821 region:rollup2
MY CONCERN IS THAT IF BUT THE

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:01.623 region:rollup2
KIDS ALREADY HAVE LEAD

01:20:58.821 --> 01:21:02.691 region:rollup2
POISONING.

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:03.926 region:rollup2
OR SOME KIND OF LEAD IN THEIR

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.493 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND WERE REQUIRING

01:21:03.926 --> 01:21:07.463 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS NOW TO TEST FOR LEAD

01:21:04.493 --> 01:21:08.731 region:rollup2
AND.

01:21:07.463 --> 01:21:09.898 region:rollup2
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THESE

01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:12.434 region:rollup2
KIDS ALREADY HAVE THE LEAD IN

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:14.703 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM. ANYWAY MY POINT IS

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:15.871 region:rollup2
WHO I ASK AND WAIT WHERE CAN WE

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:17.906 region:rollup2
GET THE INFORMATION.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:18.540 region:rollup2
I OF WHY.

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:20.509 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONLY TWENTY PERCENT OF

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:22.444 region:rollup2
THE KIDS BEING TESTED.

01:21:20.509 --> 01:21:23.545 region:rollup2
YEAH LET ME LET ME LOOK IN TO

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:25.080 region:rollup2
THE SINK EFFECTIVE BECAUSE.

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:27.616 region:rollup2
I WAS NODDING MY HEAD BECAUSE I

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:29.284 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:30.452 region:rollup2
OUT IS. WHY?

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:32.121 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO.

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:33.689 region:rollup2
BREAKING THE DATA UP IN ALL

01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:34.556 region:rollup2
THESE DIFFERENT WAYS IS TO FIND

01:21:33.689 --> 01:21:37.459 region:rollup2
OUT WHY.

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:39.228 region:rollup2
THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT GETTING

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:41.764 region:rollup2
THE LEAD TESTING THAT THEY NEED.

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:43.432 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T I PERSONALLY DON'T

01:21:41.764 --> 01:21:44.933 region:rollup2
KNOW THIS INFORMATION OFF HAND

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:46.335 region:rollup2
BUT I'M HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THIS

01:21:44.933 --> 01:21:47.736 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND REPORT BACK TO YOU YES

PLEASE AND AND IF WE COULD.

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:50.205 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:21:49.772 --> 01:21:52.474 region:rollup2
IT GOES BACK TO THE

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:54.209 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE SO WE HAVE

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:55.811 region:rollup2
THIS MONEY OUT THERE THAT IS

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:57.012 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE BEING USED FOR

01:21:55.811 --> 01:21:58.080 region:rollup2
THESE TESTS AND IT'S NOT BEING

01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:59.448 region:rollup2
USED AND IF WE'RE NOT USING THE

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:01.683 region:rollup2
MONEY THAN WHAT IS HAPPENING TO

THAT I'M HAVING IS WIRED THESE

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:09.458 region:rollup2

WHO DO WE HOLD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:33.415 region:rollup2
THIS LIKE IT'S.

01:22:31.814 --> 01:22:35.017 region:rollup2

IT'S NOT ALL CHILDREN WE KNOW

FROM THE NUMBERS THAT MISS

01:22:49.565 --> 01:22:52.401 region:rollup2
MORALIS PRESENTED WE THINK THAT

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:54.536 region:rollup2
WE'RE REACHING A SIGNIFICANT

01:22:52.401 --> 01:22:56.104 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF THE LOW INCOME

MENTIONED?

01:23:11.353 --> 01:23:15.324 region:rollup2
AND ALSO AS I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:23:13.422 --> 01:23:16.825 region:rollup2
THE PAYMENT FOR THERE'S NOT A

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:19.094 region:rollup2

REQUESTING THE TEST WHICH IT IS

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:26.768 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE REAL CHALLENGE HERE

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:29.271 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE IN WITH THE RATES

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:30.339 region:rollup2
THAT LOW. THEN THERE IT'S NOT

01:23:29.271 --> 01:23:32.140 region:rollup2
GETTING REIMBURSED BECAUSE THE

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:33.842 region:rollup2

01:54:51.151 --> 01:54:55.489 region:rollup2
CRITICAL AS WE CONSIDER FOREIGN

01:54:55.489 --> 01:54:58.458 region:rollup2
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF IT OUT

01:54:57.090 --> 01:55:00.293 region:rollup2
DATED IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK

01:54:58.458 --> 01:55:02.963 region:rollup2
ABOUT S. B. FORTY FOUR WHEN I

01:55:00.293 --> 01:55:04.464 region:rollup2
WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE.

01:55:02.963 --> 01:55:05.999 region:rollup2

02:03:02.609 --> 02:03:05.478 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATE MAKE COMMENTS BUT

02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:07.981 region:rollup2
THOSE AHEAD OF ME WE ARE POSED

02:03:05.478 --> 02:03:09.182 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND

02:03:07.981 --> 02:03:11.317 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE AGREE THAT THE

02:03:09.182 --> 02:03:12.719 region:rollup2
DATABASE IS OUTDATED AND I'M NOT

02:03:11.317 --> 02:03:14.587 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING BUT WE DON'T AGREE

02:03:12.719 --> 02:03:16.256 region:rollup2
WITH THE PATHWAY PROPOSED MOVING

02:03:14.587 --> 02:03:17.624 region:rollup2
FORWARD. AND I THINK IT'S

02:03:16.256 --> 02:03:19.292 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT HIGHLIGHTS A COUPLE OF

02:03:17.624 --> 02:03:21.828 region:rollup2
OTHER AGENCIES THAT WE'RE

02:03:19.292 --> 02:03:22.629 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT WE HAN. DTS SEE

02:03:21.828 --> 02:03:24.264 region:rollup2
THESE ARE SORT OF BEYOND THE

02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:25.431 region:rollup2
SCOPE OF THIS COMMITTEE AND SO

02:03:24.264 --> 02:03:26.466 region:rollup2
WE JUST WANNA KIND OF PAINT THE

02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:29.836 region:rollup2
PICTURE OF THE BROADER LEDGE.

02:03:26.466 --> 02:03:30.536 region:rollup2
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT AND

02:03:29.836 --> 02:03:32.905 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS ARE FACING.

02:03:30.536 --> 02:03:33.773 region:rollup2
HUMAN.

02:03:32.905 --> 02:03:36.175 region:rollup2
WHEN I BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS

02:03:33.773 --> 02:03:39.479 region:rollup2
FROM THE QUESTIONS.

02:03:36.175 --> 02:03:41.547 region:rollup2
SO I WAS HOPING IF YOU COULD.

02:03:39.479 --> 02:03:42.949 region:rollup2
BOTH DOCTORS OWN SOLOMON AND.

02:03:41.547 --> 02:03:44.918 region:rollup2
.

02:03:42.949 --> 02:03:46.619 region:rollup2
JANET NUDELMAN.

02:03:44.918 --> 02:03:48.521 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM MASSACRED THAT NOW IS

02:03:46.619 --> 02:03:50.323 region:rollup2
PERFECT.

02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:51.257 region:rollup2
CAN YOU COMMENT ABOUT GREEN

02:03:50.323 --> 02:03:53.293 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY WHICH CAME TO

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:55.528 region:rollup2
ORIGINATION AFTER THE.

02:03:53.293 --> 02:03:57.196 region:rollup2
MEET IN LAW AND

02:03:55.528 --> 02:03:58.998 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S OVERLAP DO YOU SEE

02:03:57.196 --> 02:03:59.832 region:rollup2
THESE AS.

02:03:58.998 --> 02:04:01.701 region:rollup2
COMPETING MEASURES OR

02:03:59.832 --> 02:04:03.436 region:rollup2
COMPLEMENTARY.

02:04:01.701 --> 02:04:05.071 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY NOT BROAD LEVEL AND

02:04:03.436 --> 02:04:07.173 region:rollup2
THEN YOU COULD PIGGYBACK.

02:04:05.071 --> 02:04:08.908 region:rollup2
SO. SO UNDER UNDER REALLY BROAD

02:04:07.173 --> 02:04:10.476 region:rollup2
LEVEL WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY IS IS

02:04:08.908 --> 02:04:12.645 region:rollup2
THESE TWO PROGRAMS COMPLEMENT

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:15.048 region:rollup2
EACH OTHER BUT BUT NEITHER AS A

02:04:12.645 --> 02:04:18.017 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT FOR THE OTHER. AND

02:04:15.048 --> 02:04:19.852 region:rollup2
THEY ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT OUR

02:04:18.017 --> 02:04:22.155 region:rollup2
RATE NOW THE THE SAFE COSMETICS

02:04:19.852 --> 02:04:24.290 region:rollup2
PROGRAM HAS AUTHORITY OVER.

02:04:22.155 --> 02:04:25.792 region:rollup2
THE DISCLOSURE OF PROP SIXTY

02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:27.794 region:rollup2
FIVE CHEMICALS SO THAT'S ONE

02:04:25.792 --> 02:04:29.262 region:rollup2
LESS PLUS THE THE AUTHORITATIVE

02:04:27.794 --> 02:04:30.496 region:rollup2
A LESS THAT INFORMED PROP SIXTY

02:04:29.262 --> 02:04:31.965 region:rollup2
FIVE.

02:04:30.496 --> 02:04:33.566 region:rollup2
THE THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM

02:04:31.965 --> 02:04:35.835 region:rollup2
AS LOOKING AT TWENTY FOUR

02:04:33.566 --> 02:04:37.370 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LISTS OF OF HAZARDOUS

02:04:35.835 --> 02:04:38.438 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS. SO THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:39.806 region:rollup2
REALLY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF

02:04:38.438 --> 02:04:42.342 region:rollup2
THEIR SCOPE WHEN THE GREEN

02:04:39.806 --> 02:04:44.544 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY PROGRAM EXAMINES THE

02:04:42.342 --> 02:04:46.279 region:rollup2
THE SAFETY OF SPECIFIC CHEMICALS

02:04:44.544 --> 02:04:48.247 region:rollup2
AND PRODUCTS. THEY ARE LOOKING

02:04:46.279 --> 02:04:51.117 region:rollup2
AT CHEMICAL PRODUCT COMBINATIONS

02:04:48.247 --> 02:04:53.653 region:rollup2
THAT USUALLY SPAN. LIKE IN MAYBE

02:04:51.117 --> 02:04:55.488 region:rollup2
ONE OR TWO LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

02:04:53.653 --> 02:04:57.323 region:rollup2
THEY'VE ONLY SINCE THEIR

02:04:55.488 --> 02:04:59.926 region:rollup2
INCEPTION THE SAFER CONSUMER

02:04:57.323 --> 02:05:01.627 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS PROGRAM. HAS A EXAMINED

02:04:59.926 --> 02:05:04.030 region:rollup2
IN ISSUED REGULATIONS TO LOOK AT

02:05:01.627 --> 02:05:05.465 region:rollup2
THREE DIFFERENT CHEMICAL PRODUCT

02:05:04.030 --> 02:05:06.766 region:rollup2
COMBINATIONS

02:05:05.465 --> 02:05:08.534 region:rollup2
ONE LOOK DEBT TO FLAME

02:05:06.766 --> 02:05:10.036 region:rollup2
RETARDANTS IN CHILDREN'S.

02:05:08.534 --> 02:05:11.771 region:rollup2
SLEEPING PRODUCTS

02:05:10.036 --> 02:05:14.240 region:rollup2
THE SECOND LOOK DAD MUFFLING

02:05:11.771 --> 02:05:14.841 region:rollup2
CHLORIDE SO ONE CHEMICAL IN PETE

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:17.176 region:rollup2
STRIPPER AND THE THIRD LOOKED

02:05:14.841 --> 02:05:19.512 region:rollup2
AT.

02:05:17.176 --> 02:05:22.482 region:rollup2
ONE CHEMICAL UNREACTED MD AYE IN

02:05:19.512 --> 02:05:24.183 region:rollup2
SPITE POLYURETHANE FOAM SO THE

02:05:22.482 --> 02:05:26.886 region:rollup2
POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT

02:05:24.183 --> 02:05:28.588 region:rollup2
THEY LOOK AT KIOSK A HANDFUL A

02:05:26.886 --> 02:05:31.424 region:rollup2
HANDFUL AS MIGHT EVEN BE AN

02:05:28.588 --> 02:05:32.959 region:rollup2
EXAGGERATION. OF CHEMICALS IN A

02:05:31.424 --> 02:05:34.794 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC

02:05:32.959 --> 02:05:36.929 region:rollup2
PRODUCT OR A FEW PRODUCTS IN A

02:05:34.794 --> 02:05:38.931 region:rollup2
PRODUCT CATEGORY.

02:05:36.929 --> 02:05:41.100 region:rollup2
THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM LOOKS

02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:42.635 region:rollup2
AT. LOOKS FOR.

02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:45.772 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED

02:05:42.635 --> 02:05:46.973 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS IN THE FULL SUITE OF

02:05:45.772 --> 02:05:48.107 region:rollup2
COSMETICS AND PERSONAL CARE

02:05:46.973 --> 02:05:49.709 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS THAT EXIST ON THE

02:05:48.107 --> 02:05:51.110 region:rollup2
MARKET TODAY.

02:05:49.709 --> 02:05:53.246 region:rollup2
THEY ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT

02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:54.881 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE THE QUANTITY OF

02:05:53.246 --> 02:05:56.416 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS THAT THEY LOOK AT AND

02:05:54.881 --> 02:05:58.351 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE BECAUSE. THE SAFE

02:05:56.416 --> 02:05:59.986 region:rollup2
COSMETICS PROGRAMS PURPOSES

02:05:58.351 --> 02:06:01.521 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURE OF THE INGREDIENT.

02:05:59.986 --> 02:06:04.190 region:rollup2
AND THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

02:06:01.521 --> 02:06:07.326 region:rollup2
PROGRAM HAS REGULATORY AUTHORITY

02:06:04.190 --> 02:06:08.361 region:rollup2
TO REQUIRE ALTERNATIVES TO THE.

02:06:07.326 --> 02:06:10.063 region:rollup2
TO THE CHEMICALS THAT THEY

02:06:08.361 --> 02:06:11.497 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE AND IF THEY DO FIND

02:06:10.063 --> 02:06:12.999 region:rollup2
THEM TO BE HAZARDOUS

02:06:11.497 --> 02:06:13.1000 region:rollup2
WOULD I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE A

02:06:12.999 --> 02:06:15.635 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP TO.

02:06:13.1000 --> 02:06:17.804 region:rollup2
TONY BENNETT.

02:06:15.635 --> 02:06:20.440 region:rollup2
WOULD GREEN CHEMISTRY BE ABLE TO

02:06:17.804 --> 02:06:23.276 region:rollup2
DETERMINE IF THERE ARE TOXIC

02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:25.912 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS AND HOW DO

02:06:23.276 --> 02:06:27.346 region:rollup2
WE AS CONSUMERS ENSURE THAT.

02:06:25.912 --> 02:06:29.315 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE PUTTING ON OUR BODY IS

02:06:27.346 --> 02:06:31.818 region:rollup2
SAFE TO USE?

02:06:29.315 --> 02:06:33.753 region:rollup2
I'M. THE THE GREEN CHEMISTRY

02:06:31.818 --> 02:06:34.787 region:rollup2
LAWS STADLER SH WHAT'S NOW

02:06:33.753 --> 02:06:37.857 region:rollup2
CALLED THE SAFER CONSUMER

02:06:34.787 --> 02:06:40.226 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS PROGRAM AT DTS SEE. AND

02:06:37.857 --> 02:06:42.895 region:rollup2
THAT PROGRAM HAS FROM ITS

02:06:40.226 --> 02:06:45.798 region:rollup2
INCEPTION FACED A BIT OF A CATCH

02:06:42.895 --> 02:06:48.167 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO BECAUSE. THEY.

02:06:45.798 --> 02:06:50.903 region:rollup2
NEED TO SURPASS A CERTAIN

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:52.638 region:rollup2
HURDLE IN ORDER TO MEET THE

02:06:50.903 --> 02:06:54.974 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD FOR IDENTIFYING A

02:06:52.638 --> 02:06:57.677 region:rollup2
PRIORITY. PRODUCT CHEMICAL

02:06:54.974 --> 02:07:00.079 region:rollup2
COMBINATION TO REGULATE.

02:06:57.677 --> 02:07:02.949 region:rollup2
AND THAT HURDLE INVOLVES YOU

02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:03.883 region:rollup2
SOME INFORMATION ABOUT TOXICITY

02:07:02.949 --> 02:07:06.252 region:rollup2
AND ALSO SOME.

02:07:03.883 --> 02:07:09.188 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT EXPOSURE

02:07:06.252 --> 02:07:10.256 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:07:09.188 --> 02:07:13.960 region:rollup2
AND WHAT.

02:07:10.256 --> 02:07:14.460 region:rollup2
DTS SEE QUICKLY REALIZED IN

02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:15.461 region:rollup2
TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THIS

02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:16.696 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

02:07:15.461 --> 02:07:19.632 region:rollup2
IS THAT IF THEY DON'T HAVE

02:07:16.696 --> 02:07:22.802 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT CHEMICALS

02:07:19.632 --> 02:07:25.638 region:rollup2
ARE IN A PRODUCT CATEGORY.

02:07:22.802 --> 02:07:27.406 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW

02:07:25.638 --> 02:07:30.343 region:rollup2
WHERE TO START.

02:07:27.406 --> 02:07:32.178 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO.

02:07:30.343 --> 02:07:33.679 region:rollup2
E. R. NOR TO FIGURE OUT A PATH

02:07:32.178 --> 02:07:35.248 region:rollup2
FORWARD THEY HAVE TO FIRST

02:07:33.679 --> 02:07:36.349 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT OKAY WHAT.

02:07:35.248 --> 02:07:38.284 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS WERE IN THIS PRODUCT

02:07:36.349 --> 02:07:40.419 region:rollup2
CATEGORY THEN THEY LOOK AT

02:07:38.284 --> 02:07:42.155 region:rollup2
ISSUES LIKE THAT. CONCENTRATION

02:07:40.419 --> 02:07:44.190 region:rollup2
OF THOSE CHEMICALS AND.

02:07:42.155 --> 02:07:45.825 region:rollup2
HOW COMMON THEY ARE AND HOW

02:07:44.190 --> 02:07:46.626 region:rollup2
THAT PRODUCT IS USED IN WHAT

02:07:45.825 --> 02:07:48.961 region:rollup2
THEY THERE'S LIKELY TO BE

02:07:46.626 --> 02:07:51.097 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE TO? HUMANS EITHER

02:07:48.961 --> 02:07:53.332 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY OR MAYBE INDIRECTLY

02:07:51.097 --> 02:07:56.102 region:rollup2
THROUGH AYE GOING DOWN THE DRAIN

02:07:53.332 --> 02:07:56.836 region:rollup2
IN INTO WATER SUPPLIES SO FORTH.

02:07:56.102 --> 02:08:00.106 region:rollup2
SO THOSE.

02:07:56.836 --> 02:08:02.308 region:rollup2
THEY THEY ALMOST CAN'T PASS.

02:08:00.106 --> 02:08:04.944 region:rollup2
WITHOUT INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S

02:08:02.308 --> 02:08:07.980 region:rollup2
IN PRODUCTS AND SO THIS IS ONE

02:08:04.944 --> 02:08:09.882 region:rollup2
OF THOSE SORT OF PIECES ARE OR

02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:11.551 region:rollup2
PLACES THAT THAT WE GREEN

02:08:09.882 --> 02:08:12.451 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY.

02:08:11.551 --> 02:08:14.887 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FOLKS ARE IMPLEMENTING

02:08:12.451 --> 02:08:17.757 region:rollup2
GREEN CHEMISTRY GO TO STE

02:08:14.887 --> 02:08:19.325 region:rollup2
FIND THAT IN STARTING PLACE.

02:08:17.757 --> 02:08:20.760 region:rollup2
FUNDING CAME UP IN THE

02:08:19.325 --> 02:08:23.062 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AND I WAS HOPING YOU

02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:26.098 region:rollup2
COULD. EXTRAPOLATE A LITTLE BIT

02:08:23.062 --> 02:08:28.501 region:rollup2
ABOUT. THE NEED FOR FUNDING AND.

02:08:26.098 --> 02:08:29.569 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO TELL YOU EVERY TIME

02:08:28.501 --> 02:08:31.170 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT INFORMATION

02:08:29.569 --> 02:08:33.272 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY I GET A LITTLE

02:08:31.170 --> 02:08:36.375 region:rollup2
CONCERNED BECAUSE IT DOES ALWAYS

02:08:33.272 --> 02:08:38.177 region:rollup2
SEEM LIKE. WE SPEND.

02:08:36.375 --> 02:08:40.613 region:rollup2
EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO

02:08:38.177 --> 02:08:42.114 region:rollup2
DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS.

02:08:40.613 --> 02:08:44.150 region:rollup2
SO SOMEONE ONE THING THAT I

02:08:42.114 --> 02:08:46.085 region:rollup2
FOUND VERY SURPRISING BY THE THE

02:08:44.150 --> 02:08:47.386 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION'S TESTIMONY IS THAT

02:08:46.085 --> 02:08:48.754 region:rollup2
MANY OF THEM WERE COMPLAINING

02:08:47.386 --> 02:08:49.589 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THIS

02:08:48.754 --> 02:08:51.457 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE ON THE

02:08:49.589 --> 02:08:53.226 region:rollup2
BUDGET AND THERE WOULD BE NO

02:08:51.457 --> 02:08:54.860 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON THE BUDGET.

02:08:53.226 --> 02:08:56.095 region:rollup2
AND I WANNA MAKE A REALLY CLEAR

02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:58.664 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF

02:08:56.095 --> 02:09:00.466 region:rollup2
PROPOSING A NEW FEE MECHANISM.

02:08:58.664 --> 02:09:02.635 region:rollup2
THE THE IMPACT WOULD BE ON THE

02:09:00.466 --> 02:09:04.370 region:rollup2
COMPANIES REPORTING THE PRODUCTS

02:09:02.635 --> 02:09:06.973 region:rollup2
TO THE SAFE COSMETICS DATABASE.

02:09:04.370 --> 02:09:08.407 region:rollup2
AT OF FAIRY VERY NOMINAL LEVELS

02:09:06.973 --> 02:09:10.109 region:rollup2
ASSESSING A FEE OF THIRTY

02:09:08.407 --> 02:09:12.044 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER PRODUCT.

02:09:10.109 --> 02:09:13.346 region:rollup2
THAT'S REPORTED TO THE DATABASE

02:09:12.044 --> 02:09:15.348 region:rollup2
WOULD WOULD NOT HAVE A

02:09:13.346 --> 02:09:17.049 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN AND THAT

02:09:15.348 --> 02:09:18.751 region:rollup2
MY BELIEF ON ON ANY OF THE

02:09:17.049 --> 02:09:20.119 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT ARE REPORTING. OF

02:09:18.751 --> 02:09:21.721 region:rollup2
THESE PRODUCTS SO SO I JUST WANT

02:09:20.119 --> 02:09:24.357 region:rollup2
TO MAKE CLEAR THERE IS NO IMPACT

02:09:21.721 --> 02:09:25.725 region:rollup2
ON THE BUT BUDGET AND THAT'S WHY

02:09:24.357 --> 02:09:28.661 region:rollup2
WERE. WERE HERE TODAY.

02:09:25.725 --> 02:09:29.595 region:rollup2
IN IN TERMS OF WHAT THE SECOND

02:09:28.661 --> 02:09:31.530 region:rollup2
PART OF YOUR QUESTION IS WHAT

02:09:29.595 --> 02:09:32.698 region:rollup2
WITH A FUNDING PAY FOR.

02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:34.166 region:rollup2
EVEN OF THE THE PROBLEM WITH THE

02:09:32.698 --> 02:09:35.835 region:rollup2
DATABASE AND AYE I HEAR YOUR

02:09:34.166 --> 02:09:37.103 region:rollup2
CONCERN ABOUT THAT IS SINCE

02:09:35.835 --> 02:09:38.471 region:rollup2
AUGUST THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

02:09:37.103 --> 02:09:40.039 region:rollup2
HEALTH HAS INFORMED US THAT

02:09:38.471 --> 02:09:41.574 region:rollup2
THEY'VE RECEIVED. JUST SINCE

02:09:40.039 --> 02:09:43.743 region:rollup2
AUGUST THE LAST SIX MONTHS

02:09:41.574 --> 02:09:47.647 region:rollup2
NEARLY THREE HUNDRED.

02:09:43.743 --> 02:09:49.048 region:rollup2
USER ERROR SO THAT MEANS.

02:09:47.647 --> 02:09:50.516 region:rollup2
BUT THREE HUNDRED TIMES WHEN

02:09:49.048 --> 02:09:53.252 region:rollup2
WHEN A COMPANY WAS TRYING TO

02:09:50.516 --> 02:09:55.388 region:rollup2
INPUT DATA INTO THE DATABASE.

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:56.522 region:rollup2
THEY RECEIVED AN ERROR AND

02:09:55.388 --> 02:09:57.990 region:rollup2
THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM BECAUSE

02:09:56.522 --> 02:09:59.659 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS THAT THE INFORMATION

02:09:57.990 --> 02:10:01.127 region:rollup2
IS NOT GETTING INTO THE DATABASE

02:09:59.659 --> 02:10:02.461 region:rollup2
EN.

02:10:01.127 --> 02:10:05.064 region:rollup2
A CLEAR AND CONSISTENT AND

02:10:02.461 --> 02:10:06.732 region:rollup2
USABLE MANNER SO THE DATABASE IS

02:10:05.064 --> 02:10:08.200 region:rollup2
MALFUNCTIONING I MEAN THAT IS

02:10:06.732 --> 02:10:10.102 region:rollup2
JUST A REALITY.

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:12.405 region:rollup2
IT IT DOES NEED TO BE REPLACED

02:10:10.102 --> 02:10:14.173 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT IS PART OF OUR OF

02:10:12.405 --> 02:10:15.941 region:rollup2
OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL BUT IT'S IT

02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:18.144 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A ONE TIME FEE. TO

02:10:15.941 --> 02:10:23.916 region:rollup2
CONDUCT A THE OVERHAUL OF THE

02:10:18.144 --> 02:10:25.251 region:rollup2
DEBATE DATABASE ITSELF.

02:10:23.916 --> 02:10:26.419 region:rollup2
ONE MAKE SURE IF YOU HAVE ANY

02:10:25.251 --> 02:10:27.987 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS I WAS TO STOP

02:10:26.419 --> 02:10:29.488 region:rollup2
ATTACKING ALSO A LOT TRYING TO

02:10:27.987 --> 02:10:29.789 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT THAT THE FUNDING

02:10:29.488 --> 02:10:31.624 region:rollup2
SOURCE AND.

02:10:29.789 --> 02:10:32.858 region:rollup2
.

02:10:31.624 --> 02:10:34.927 region:rollup2
SOLD JUST TO UNDERSTAND

02:10:32.858 --> 02:10:36.762 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY SO RIGHT NOW. I'M THE

02:10:34.927 --> 02:10:38.230 region:rollup2
STATE IS FUNDING THE PROGRAM AND

02:10:36.762 --> 02:10:39.899 region:rollup2
THAT YOUR PROPOSAL IS TO.

02:10:38.230 --> 02:10:41.801 region:rollup2
INCREASE SAID BUT TO CHARGE THE

02:10:39.899 --> 02:10:43.369 region:rollup2
COMPANIES FOR THAT FEE EXACTLY

02:10:41.801 --> 02:10:44.870 region:rollup2
SO THE CURRENT OF THIS THE

02:10:43.369 --> 02:10:46.906 region:rollup2
CURRENT ARM FUNDING FROM THE

02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:49.175 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND IS THREE HUNDRED

02:10:46.906 --> 02:10:50.910 region:rollup2
AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:10:49.175 --> 02:10:52.812 region:rollup2
AND WERE WE'RE PROPOSING TO TO

02:10:50.910 --> 02:10:54.380 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENT THAT FUNDING WITH.

02:10:52.812 --> 02:10:55.614 region:rollup2
THE FEE.

02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:56.649 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD BE ASSESSED ON THE

02:10:55.614 --> 02:10:59.518 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS REGISTERED WITH A

02:10:56.649 --> 02:11:00.853 region:rollup2
DATABASE.

02:10:59.518 --> 02:11:02.321 region:rollup2
AND THE FEE IS A ONE TIME FEE OR

02:11:00.853 --> 02:11:04.423 region:rollup2
AN ONGOING FEE ON IT WOULD BE IT

02:11:02.321 --> 02:11:05.191 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE AN ANNUAL FEE THAT

02:11:04.423 --> 02:11:06.859 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ASSESSED ON THE

02:11:05.191 --> 02:11:08.194 region:rollup2
COMPANIES. BECAUSE THE THE

02:11:06.859 --> 02:11:09.995 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS THAT ARE ENTERED INTO

02:11:08.194 --> 02:11:11.497 region:rollup2
THE DATABASE CHANGE OVER TIME

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:13.733 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE CONSTANTLY FOR

02:11:11.497 --> 02:11:15.434 region:rollup2
REFORMULATING. THEIR PRODUCTS SO

02:11:13.733 --> 02:11:17.570 region:rollup2
I AS COMPANY I MIGHT BE

02:11:15.434 --> 02:11:19.071 region:rollup2
REGISTERING A PRODUCT TODAY THAT

02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:20.740 region:rollup2
CONTAINED STYRENE.

02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:23.008 region:rollup2
AND PAY A THIRTY DOLLAR FEE

02:11:20.740 --> 02:11:24.810 region:rollup2
NEXT YEAR I'VE MIGHT REFORMULATE

02:11:23.008 --> 02:11:26.512 region:rollup2
STYRENE OUT OF THAT PRODUCT AND

02:11:24.810 --> 02:11:28.180 region:rollup2
THEN I HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT.

02:11:26.512 --> 02:11:30.549 region:rollup2
TO THE STATE SO IT WOULD BE

02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:32.084 region:rollup2
NECESSARY THAT THAT THE ANNUAL

02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:33.986 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT OF THE FEE OR THE

02:11:32.084 --> 02:11:36.355 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT OF THE FEE TAKE PLACE

02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:37.690 region:rollup2
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

02:11:36.355 --> 02:11:38.224 region:rollup2
BY NOT GIVING TO TECHNICALITIES

02:11:37.690 --> 02:11:40.126 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IF A PRODUCT AS

02:11:38.224 --> 02:11:41.627 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE TWO THE IS IT JUST ONE

02:11:40.126 --> 02:11:43.462 region:rollup2
YEAH A THAT'S A REALLY GOOD

02:11:41.627 --> 02:11:45.197 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT THE FEE WOULDN'T

02:11:43.462 --> 02:11:46.632 region:rollup2
CHANGE BASED ON THE NUMBER. OF

02:11:45.197 --> 02:11:48.567 region:rollup2
PROP SIXTY FIVE CHEMICALS IN THE

02:11:46.632 --> 02:11:50.436 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS AND I COULD SHARE WITH

02:11:48.567 --> 02:11:51.904 region:rollup2
YOU SOME SOME REALLY GOOD

02:11:50.436 --> 02:11:54.073 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATIONS OF PRODUCTS THAT

02:11:51.904 --> 02:11:55.674 region:rollup2
CONTAIN MULTIPLE PROP SIXTY FIVE

02:11:54.073 --> 02:11:57.076 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS I MEAN ONE IN QUESTION

02:11:55.674 --> 02:11:58.844 region:rollup2
HAS SEVEN. DFFERENT.

02:11:57.076 --> 02:12:01.714 region:rollup2
CARCINOGENS REPRODUCTIVE

02:11:58.844 --> 02:12:02.948 region:rollup2
TOXICANTS BUT THAT COMPANY WOULD

02:12:01.714 --> 02:12:04.850 region:rollup2
JUST PAY THE THIRTY DOLLARS.

02:12:02.948 --> 02:12:05.751 region:rollup2
ONCE FOR THAT PRODUCT MEANT JUST

02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:07.987 region:rollup2
ONE MORE QUESTION.

02:12:05.751 --> 02:12:09.655 region:rollup2
SO.

02:12:07.987 --> 02:12:10.823 region:rollup2
WE DON'T THESE PRODUCTS AND

02:12:09.655 --> 02:12:12.658 region:rollup2
RENO'S BECAUSE I LOOK AT LABELS

02:12:10.823 --> 02:12:13.526 region:rollup2
ALL THE TIME. SO DON'T THESE

02:12:12.658 --> 02:12:15.261 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS HAVE THAT ON THE LOWER

02:12:13.526 --> 02:12:16.028 region:rollup2
THEIR LABELS THE INFORMATION ON

02:12:15.261 --> 02:12:17.830 region:rollup2
THE LABELS.

02:12:16.028 --> 02:12:20.032 region:rollup2
.

02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:21.567 region:rollup2
YES BEYOND FOOD DRUG AND

02:12:20.032 --> 02:12:23.002 region:rollup2
COSMETIC SAFETY ACT AS BEEN

02:12:21.567 --> 02:12:24.603 region:rollup2
AMENDED ONE SINCE NINETEEN

02:12:23.002 --> 02:12:26.772 region:rollup2
THIRTY EIGHT AND THAT WAS THIRTY

02:12:24.603 --> 02:12:28.607 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO TO. TO MANDATE

02:12:26.772 --> 02:12:30.075 region:rollup2
INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE ON THAT

02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:31.610 region:rollup2
PRODUCT LABELS OF PERSONAL CARE

02:12:30.075 --> 02:12:32.678 region:rollup2
AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS

02:12:31.610 --> 02:12:34.280 region:rollup2
SO ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS IN A

02:12:32.678 --> 02:12:36.382 region:rollup2
PRODUCT DO HAVE TO SHOW UP ON

02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:38.584 region:rollup2
THE LABEL EXCEPT FOR. FRAGRANCE

02:12:36.382 --> 02:12:40.219 region:rollup2
FLAVORINGS AND COLORANTS.

02:12:38.584 --> 02:12:41.520 region:rollup2
SO YES CONSUMERS DO OF THE

REALLY HARD TO READ THE LABELS

02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:53.232 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND HER

02:12:51.497 --> 02:12:55.100 region:rollup2
DISTINGUISH. BETWEEN THE

02:12:53.232 --> 02:12:57.636 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS ON THE LABELS AND IT

02:12:55.100 --> 02:13:00.005 region:rollup2
FEELS LIKE A A REALLY LOGICAL.

02:12:57.636 --> 02:13:01.540 region:rollup2
AND UNFAIR FUNCTION OF THE

02:27:17.262 --> 02:27:20.165 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT RIGHT UP OF THIS

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:23.001 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL SO I'LL JUST PROVIDE.

02:27:20.165 --> 02:27:24.569 region:rollup2
LITTLE OVERVIEW LITTLE CONTEXT.

02:27:23.001 --> 02:27:25.403 region:rollup2
A TO BE IN WITH A LOCAL HEALTH

02:27:24.569 --> 02:27:27.338 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS ARE THE ENTITY

02:27:25.403 --> 02:27:28.540 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR BEACH WATER

02:27:27.338 --> 02:27:30.275 region:rollup2
SAFETY AND TESTING FOR

02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:31.142 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION. OF THE ONES THAT

02:27:30.275 --> 02:27:32.777 region:rollup2
WOULD POST A BEACH WITH A

02:27:31.142 --> 02:27:36.214 region:rollup2
WARNING SIGN IF NECESSARY OR

02:27:32.777 --> 02:27:38.016 region:rollup2
EVEN CLOSE BEACH WHEN NECESSARY.

02:27:36.214 --> 02:27:39.050 region:rollup2
OUR DEPARTMENT DETERMINES.

02:27:38.016 --> 02:27:40.785 region:rollup2
THE TESTING METHODS AND THE

02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:43.154 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND THAT ARE NECESSARY

02:27:40.785 --> 02:27:44.489 region:rollup2
TO ESTABLISH THE SAFETY OF BEACH

02:27:43.154 --> 02:27:45.857 region:rollup2
WATER. AND WE DO THAT TO

02:27:44.489 --> 02:27:48.426 region:rollup2
REGULATION.

02:27:45.857 --> 02:27:49.861 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT GOLD STANDARD FOR

02:27:48.426 --> 02:27:51.396 region:rollup2
DOCTOR LOGIC TESTING OF OF OCEAN

02:27:49.861 --> 02:27:53.498 region:rollup2
WATER.

02:27:51.396 --> 02:27:54.432 region:rollup2
IS CULTURE BASED AND THOSE YOU

02:27:53.498 --> 02:27:55.700 region:rollup2
THAT OF BEEN INVOLVED

02:27:54.432 --> 02:27:57.335 region:rollup2
MICROBIOLOGY PROBABLY KNOW THAT

02:27:55.700 --> 02:27:58.670 region:rollup2
CULTURE REQUIRES TIME FOR THE

02:27:57.335 --> 02:28:00.505 region:rollup2
ORGANISM TO GROW. THE AVERAGE

02:27:58.670 --> 02:28:02.373 region:rollup2
TURNAROUND TIME FOR THAT TESTS

02:28:00.505 --> 02:28:03.875 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT TWO DAYS.

02:28:02.373 --> 02:28:05.677 region:rollup2
SO THAT HAS POTENTIAL HEALTH AND

02:28:03.875 --> 02:28:07.512 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES BY TAKING

02:28:05.677 --> 02:28:09.214 region:rollup2
SO MUCH TIME THE WATER COULDBE

02:28:07.512 --> 02:28:11.015 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATED FOR THOSE TWO DAYS

02:28:09.214 --> 02:28:11.616 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE TEST COMES BACK AND

02:28:11.015 --> 02:28:12.083 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE STILL SWIMMING AND

02:28:11.616 --> 02:28:13.918 region:rollup2
IT.

02:28:12.083 --> 02:28:15.320 region:rollup2
IS ALSO THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHEN

02:28:13.918 --> 02:28:17.622 region:rollup2
THE BEACHES

02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:18.923 region:rollup2
CLEAR AND ALLOWED TO REOPEN

02:28:17.622 --> 02:28:20.024 region:rollup2
THERE'S A TWO DAY DELAY IN THAT

02:28:18.923 --> 02:28:22.460 region:rollup2
AND THAT AFFECTS TOURISM AND

02:28:20.024 --> 02:28:24.262 region:rollup2
OTHER ECONOMIC IMPACTS.

02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:25.463 region:rollup2
SO THESE NEW RAPID METHODS HAVE

02:28:24.262 --> 02:28:26.798 region:rollup2
BECOME AVAILABLE IN RECENT YEARS

02:28:25.463 --> 02:28:28.133 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CALLED POLYMERIZED CHAIN

02:28:26.798 --> 02:28:29.667 region:rollup2
REACTION METHODS AND.

02:28:28.133 --> 02:28:31.669 region:rollup2
OF VERY QUICKLY.

02:28:29.667 --> 02:28:33.705 region:rollup2
THEY ARE A METHOD TO DETECT THE

02:28:31.669 --> 02:28:34.939 region:rollup2
DNA OF THE BACTERIAL ORGANISM AS

02:28:33.705 --> 02:28:36.708 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO CULTURING FOR ALIVE

02:28:34.939 --> 02:28:37.842 region:rollup2
ORGANISM.

02:28:36.708 --> 02:28:39.544 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE ABOUT A FOR OUR

02:28:37.842 --> 02:28:41.212 region:rollup2
TURNAROUND TIME AND.

02:28:39.544 --> 02:28:42.914 region:rollup2
SO BECAUSE OF THAT S. B.

02:28:41.212 --> 02:28:45.283 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE.

02:28:42.914 --> 02:28:46.718 region:rollup2
CAME INTO LAW WHICH REQUIRES

02:28:45.283 --> 02:28:48.386 region:rollup2
THE STATE TO DEVELOP AND

02:28:46.718 --> 02:28:50.121 region:rollup2
VALIDATE THE NEW TEST METHODS.

02:28:48.386 --> 02:28:52.090 region:rollup2
FOR USE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:28:50.121 --> 02:28:54.292 region:rollup2
THIRTY COMPLEX IT SPECIFIC TO

02:28:52.090 --> 02:28:55.260 region:rollup2
EACH LOCATION EACH BEACH CAN

02:28:54.292 --> 02:28:56.895 region:rollup2
HAVE DIFFERENT INTERFERING

02:28:55.260 --> 02:28:58.229 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE AS THE WATER. THERE'S

02:28:56.895 --> 02:28:59.330 region:rollup2
A LOT OF SIDE BY SIDE TESTING

02:28:58.229 --> 02:29:00.698 region:rollup2
AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT

02:28:59.330 --> 02:29:02.667 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO REPAIR

02:29:00.698 --> 02:29:04.169 region:rollup2
TESTING STANDARDS GUIDELINES.

02:29:02.667 --> 02:29:06.204 region:rollup2
AND CONDUCT TRAININGS AND REVISE

02:29:04.169 --> 02:29:08.072 region:rollup2
OUR REGULATIONS.

02:29:06.204 --> 02:29:10.108 region:rollup2
SO WE S. BEGAN WITH A BUDGET

02:29:08.072 --> 02:29:11.309 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THREE YEARS AGO THAT

02:29:10.108 --> 02:29:12.343 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE RESOURCES FOR THE

02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:13.711 region:rollup2
NATIONAL LAB WORK AND ONLY LAB

02:29:12.343 --> 02:29:14.612 region:rollup2
WORK.

02:29:13.711 --> 02:29:15.847 region:rollup2
OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN

02:29:14.612 --> 02:29:17.382 region:rollup2
COMPLETED DATA AS WELL DESCRIBE

02:29:15.847 --> 02:29:18.149 region:rollup2
IN YOUR PACKET I WON'T REPEAT IT

02:29:17.382 --> 02:29:19.617 region:rollup2
HERE WE'VE.

02:29:18.149 --> 02:29:20.919 region:rollup2
BUT CLOBBERING QUITE CLOSE TO

02:29:19.617 --> 02:29:22.921 region:rollup2
THE STAKEHOLDERS.

02:29:20.919 --> 02:29:24.456 region:rollup2
AND ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT.

02:29:22.921 --> 02:29:25.690 region:rollup2
THE KERN PROPOSAL THEN REQUESTS

02:29:24.456 --> 02:29:27.492 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO COMPLETE

STUDY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:29:33.465 --> 02:29:34.966 region:rollup2
RECALL THE FORTY SIX BEACH

02:29:33.998 --> 02:29:36.668 region:rollup2
STUDY.

02:29:34.966 --> 02:29:37.802 region:rollup2
THE SOME OF THE SITE SPECIFIC

02:29:36.668 --> 02:29:39.771 region:rollup2
CRITERIA AND THERE'S ALSO A

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:41.606 region:rollup2
NEWER PC ARE AVAILABLE BUT WON'T

02:29:39.771 --> 02:29:42.707 region:rollup2
GO INTO THE DETAILS BUT I IT'S

02:29:41.606 --> 02:29:43.975 region:rollup2
AN EVEN APPROVED RAPID TESTED

02:29:42.707 --> 02:29:45.410 region:rollup2
WERE INCORPORATING IN OUR

02:29:43.975 --> 02:29:46.377 region:rollup2
EVALUATION.

02:29:45.410 --> 02:29:46.911 region:rollup2
AND THE BEGINNING IN THE THIRD

02:29:46.377 --> 02:29:49.314 region:rollup2
YEAR WILL.

02:29:46.911 --> 02:29:50.815 region:rollup2
BEGIN DRAFTING THE REGULATIONS

02:29:49.314 --> 02:29:52.684 region:rollup2
WITH THE REVISED GUIDANCE FOR

LOCALS AS WELL AS PROVIDE

02:29:52.684 --> 02:29:55.320 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THEM.

02:29:53.918 --> 02:29:57.455 region:rollup2
AND WE EXPECT TO BE COMPLETELY

02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:59.224 region:rollup2
DONE IN FIVE YEARS.

02:29:57.455 --> 02:30:00.458 region:rollup2
OPEN QUESTIONS OF COURSE

02:29:59.224 --> 02:30:01.960 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA OPENING

02:30:00.458 --> 02:30:03.194 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:06.097 region:rollup2
WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE

02:30:03.194 --> 02:30:07.632 region:rollup2
ISSUE TWELVE AT THIS TIME.

02:30:06.097 --> 02:30:09.300 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK

02:30:07.632 --> 02:30:10.835 region:rollup2
UP TO THE DYESS. HOME I WAS

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:12.804 region:rollup2
HOPING YOU CAN JUST MAKE IT A

02:30:10.835 --> 02:30:14.906 region:rollup2
LITTLE REAL FOR ME I UNDERSTOOD

02:30:12.804 --> 02:30:16.374 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS RECENTLY A SPELL

02:30:14.906 --> 02:30:19.210 region:rollup2
IN MONTEREY.

02:30:16.374 --> 02:30:21.646 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD THIS HAVE PLAYED OUT

02:30:19.210 --> 02:30:23.848 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD THE PC ARE HAVE HELPED

02:30:21.646 --> 02:30:25.583 region:rollup2
TO? IDENTIFY THE ORGANISM

02:30:23.848 --> 02:30:27.418 region:rollup2
EARLIER OR OPEN UP THE BEACH

02:30:25.583 --> 02:30:29.153 region:rollup2
SOONER CAN YOU GIVE US THAT AS A

02:30:27.418 --> 02:30:30.889 region:rollup2
REAL WORLD EXAMPLE.

02:30:29.153 --> 02:30:32.156 region:rollup2
WELL SO I DON'T RECALL THIS BILL

02:30:30.889 --> 02:30:33.658 region:rollup2
MONTEREY BUT IF THERE'S A FACE

02:30:32.156 --> 02:30:34.893 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE SEWAGE OUTFLOW OR

02:30:33.658 --> 02:30:36.027 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

02:30:34.893 --> 02:30:37.228 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY LOCAL HEALTH

02:30:36.027 --> 02:30:38.696 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WILL CLOSE THE BEACH

02:30:37.228 --> 02:30:40.465 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY BASED ON THAT

02:30:38.696 --> 02:30:41.933 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE OF SEWAGE OUTFLOW

02:30:40.465 --> 02:30:42.934 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE KNOWN RISK HAZARD

02:30:41.933 --> 02:30:44.035 region:rollup2
OF THAT.

02:30:42.934 --> 02:30:45.270 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A FLOOD FOR EXAMPLE

02:30:44.035 --> 02:30:46.571 region:rollup2
IN A SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT CAN

02:30:45.270 --> 02:30:48.039 region:rollup2
OVERFLOW.

02:30:46.571 --> 02:30:49.173 region:rollup2
BUT THESE ARE MORE ACTUALLY

02:30:48.039 --> 02:30:51.542 region:rollup2
TESTS ARE MORE VALUABLE IN

02:30:49.173 --> 02:30:52.977 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WE DON'T HAVE A KNOWN

02:30:51.542 --> 02:30:55.179 region:rollup2
HAZARD LIKE THAT.

02:30:52.977 --> 02:30:57.148 region:rollup2
AND SO IT MAY BE.

02:30:55.179 --> 02:30:58.182 region:rollup2
HEAVY USE OF THE BEACH AND

02:30:57.148 --> 02:31:00.084 region:rollup2
MAYBE SOMETHING RELATED TO A

02:30:58.182 --> 02:31:01.319 region:rollup2
SUITABLE THAT'S THAT'S NOT KNOWN

02:31:00.084 --> 02:31:03.121 region:rollup2
OR OTHER CAUSES OF SOME KIND OF

02:31:01.319 --> 02:31:05.223 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION. BUT THE ADVANTAGE

02:31:03.121 --> 02:31:06.591 region:rollup2
OF THE RAPID TEST IS REALLY THAT

02:31:05.223 --> 02:31:08.526 region:rollup2
ONCE WE HAVE ALL THESE METHODS

02:31:06.591 --> 02:31:09.928 region:rollup2
IN PLACE AND HAVE VALIDATED AT

02:31:08.526 --> 02:31:10.895 region:rollup2
EVERY AT VARIOUS SPEECH

02:31:09.928 --> 02:31:12.263 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS.

02:31:10.895 --> 02:31:13.598 region:rollup2
WE'LL HAVE RESULTS A LOCAL

02:31:12.263 --> 02:31:14.399 region:rollup2
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FIVE RESULTS

02:31:13.598 --> 02:31:16.935 region:rollup2

SAMPLES WITHIN FOUR HOURS AS

02:31:16.935 --> 02:31:19.570 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO TWO DAYS AND SO THEY

02:31:18.169 --> 02:31:21.172 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE THEIR DECISIONS ON

02:31:19.570 --> 02:31:21.773 region:rollup2
ADVISING THE PUBLIC ARE CLOSING

INSUFFICIENT STAFFING IS A YOU

02:42:02.613 --> 02:42:06.550 region:rollup2

02:42:16.894 --> 02:42:21.799 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT'S NEEDS CANNOT BE

02:42:19.363 --> 02:42:23.334 region:rollup2
MET SO IT'S AUTOMATIC NEGLECT.

02:42:21.799 --> 02:42:25.035 region:rollup2
INCREASED STAFFING IS TO MEET

IZZIE INCREASE IN THE NURSING

02:42:38.349 --> 02:42:41.952 region:rollup2
HOWARD HOURS WE DON'T SUPPORT IS

02:42:40.918 --> 02:42:43.854 region:rollup2
THE WAIVER THAT ALLOWS

02:42:41.952 --> 02:42:45.422 region:rollup2
FACILITIES NOT TO ADHERE TO THE

02:42:43.854 --> 02:42:47.191 region:rollup2
INCREASE NURSING?

02:42:45.422 --> 02:42:49.193 region:rollup2
THE WAIVER WOULD BE TO DO YOU

02:42:47.191 --> 02:42:51.028 region:rollup2
BEND DE WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO

02:42:49.193 --> 02:42:53.464 region:rollup2
THE PATIENTS AS IT COULD ALLOW A

02:42:51.028 --> 02:42:55.499 region:rollup2
FACILITY. TO BE UNDERSTAFFED.

02:42:53.464 --> 02:42:57.201 region:rollup2
AGAINST STATUTE.

02:42:55.499 --> 02:42:59.169 region:rollup2
FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS

02:42:57.201 --> 02:43:00.671 region:rollup2

NOT STOPPING. TO MEET THE NEEDS

02:43:00.671 --> 02:43:04.675 region:rollup2
OF THE PATIENT.

02:43:02.573 --> 02:43:06.410 region:rollup2
DPH HAS NO PLANS ON WHAT TO DO

02:43:04.675 --> 02:43:08.445 region:rollup2
WHEN A FACILITY CONTINUES TO BE

02:43:06.410 --> 02:43:10.748 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAFFED.

02:43:08.445 --> 02:43:12.182 region:rollup2
THE WORK FORCE IS DEFICIENT.

02:43:10.748 --> 02:43:13.250 region:rollup2
AND THE WORKFORCE IS DEFICIENT

02:43:12.182 --> 02:43:14.652 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STATING THAT THE

02:43:13.250 --> 02:43:16.220 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE IS DEFICIENT AND

02:43:14.652 --> 02:43:17.755 region:rollup2
THEREFORE THEY CAN'T HIRE. SO

02:43:16.220 --> 02:43:19.657 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALLOWING WAIVERS TO

02:43:17.755 --> 02:43:21.458 region:rollup2
FACILITIES THAT CAN PROVE THAT

02:43:19.657 --> 02:43:23.827 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T HIRE ENOUGH YET THE

02:43:21.458 --> 02:43:25.162 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS FUNDS AVAILABLE

02:43:23.827 --> 02:43:26.930 region:rollup2
TO HELP THE FACILITIES TO HIRE

02:43:25.162 --> 02:43:28.699 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

02:43:26.930 --> 02:43:29.633 region:rollup2
JUST LAST WEEK THE INDUSTRY

02:43:28.699 --> 02:43:32.202 region:rollup2
STATED.

02:43:29.633 --> 02:43:33.704 region:rollup2
THAT REGULATIONS HAVE BECOME

02:43:32.202 --> 02:43:35.372 region:rollup2
AFFECTED SO.

02:43:33.704 --> 02:43:37.741 region:rollup2
JULY FIRST OF EIGHTEEN. HAVE

APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN HUNDRED

02:43:37.741 --> 02:43:40.911 region:rollup2
NURSING HOMES IN CALIFORNIA SIX

02:43:39.643 --> 02:43:43.414 region:rollup2
HUNDRED WILL BE FILING FOR

02:43:40.911 --> 02:43:44.615 region:rollup2
WAIVERS.

02:43:43.414 --> 02:43:45.249 region:rollup2
THAT SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO

02:43:44.615 --> 02:43:47.384 region:rollup2
MEET THE NEW STAFFING

02:43:45.249 --> 02:43:48.819 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS.

02:43:47.384 --> 02:43:50.688 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S ABDOMINAL HIDE

02:43:48.819 --> 02:43:51.689 region:rollup2
THIS IS JUST TERRIBLE IT'S NOT

02:43:50.688 --> 02:43:54.024 region:rollup2
THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE

02:43:51.689 --> 02:43:54.358 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND

02:43:54.024 --> 02:43:56.427 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IS.

02:43:54.358 --> 02:43:57.294 region:rollup2
.

02:43:56.427 --> 02:43:59.196 region:rollup2
PUTTING THE NURSING HOME

02:43:57.294 --> 02:44:01.398 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AT GREAT RISK FOR POOR

02:43:59.196 --> 02:44:02.900 region:rollup2
CARE AND A GLASS.

02:44:01.398 --> 02:44:04.935 region:rollup2
IT APPEARS THAT.

02:44:02.900 --> 02:44:06.770 region:rollup2
DE IT.

02:44:04.935 --> 02:44:08.539 region:rollup2
ALSO IN THIS THE PAPERS HERE

02:44:06.770 --> 02:44:10.841 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS.

02:44:08.539 --> 02:44:13.377 region:rollup2
UMPIRE ASKING TO POSTPONE ALL IS

02:44:10.841 --> 02:44:15.079 region:rollup2
THE STAKEHOLDERS I CONSIDER TO

02:44:13.377 --> 02:44:16.680 region:rollup2
BE NOT THE INDUSTRY.

02:44:15.079 --> 02:44:19.383 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY WANTS IS TO BE

02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:20.684 region:rollup2
POSTPONED NOT THE STAKEHOLDERS.

02:44:19.383 --> 02:44:22.386 region:rollup2
SO IT APPEARS THAT DPH HAS

02:44:20.684 --> 02:44:23.887 region:rollup2
IGNORED OUR REQUEST AS A

02:44:22.386 --> 02:44:25.489 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS THAT REPRESENT THE

02:44:23.887 --> 02:44:28.726 region:rollup2
FAMILIES IN THE STATE.

02:44:25.489 --> 02:44:29.793 region:rollup2
THAT WAIVERS NOT BE ALLOWED.

02:44:28.726 --> 02:44:32.396 region:rollup2
IN THE WAIVERS THAT THEY HAVE

02:44:29.793 --> 02:44:34.465 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH. NOT BE IMPLEMENTED

02:44:32.396 --> 02:44:35.699 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT LEAVES A AND A WHAT

02:44:34.465 --> 02:44:37.134 region:rollup2
WE HEARD FROM THE INDUSTRY WE'RE

02:44:35.699 --> 02:44:39.069 region:rollup2
ALL SHOCKED.

02:44:37.134 --> 02:44:40.771 region:rollup2
THIS IS JUST LAST THURSDAY THAT

BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO

02:58:40.343 --> 02:58:44.614 region:rollup2
ENSURE GREATER INVESTMENT IN THE

02:58:42.545 --> 02:58:46.082 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AT THAT TIME. WE WERE IN

02:58:44.614 --> 02:58:49.018 region:rollup2
A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE.

02:58:46.082 --> 02:58:50.820 region:rollup2
THE THOUGH WAY THAT THAT STATE

02:58:49.018 --> 02:58:52.088 region:rollup2
WAS CALCULATING WORKFORCE NEEDS

02:58:50.820 --> 02:58:53.289 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME WOULD HAVE

02:58:52.088 --> 02:58:55.692 region:rollup2
INDICATED THAT THE STATE NEEDED

02:58:53.289 --> 02:58:56.559 region:rollup2
FEWER WORKERS NOT MORE AND SO

02:58:55.692 --> 02:58:58.461 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THE

02:58:56.559 --> 02:59:00.530 region:rollup2
STATE HAS REVAMPED ITS PROCESS

02:58:58.461 --> 02:59:00.863 region:rollup2
FOR HOW IT LOOKS AT WORKLOAD.

02:59:00.530 --> 02:59:01.998 region:rollup2
AND.

02:59:00.863 --> 02:59:03.499 region:rollup2
WOULD WELCOME AS OTHER

02:59:01.998 --> 02:59:05.835 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS MENTIONED GETTING

02:59:03.499 --> 02:59:07.237 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ON

02:59:05.835 --> 02:59:09.572 region:rollup2
WHAT THOSE WORKLOAD PRETTY OUR

02:59:07.237 --> 02:59:11.140 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS ARE BASED ON AND HOW

02:59:09.572 --> 02:59:13.109 region:rollup2
THEY. HOW THEY WORK TO DAY I

02:59:11.140 --> 02:59:13.776 region:rollup2
WILL NOTE THAT AT THAT TIME WE

02:59:13.109 --> 02:59:15.278 region:rollup2
ALSO?

02:59:13.776 --> 02:59:17.046 region:rollup2
MADE IT CLEAR TO THE

02:59:15.278 --> 02:59:19.549 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE THAT THE UNDER

02:59:17.046 --> 02:59:21.117 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IN THIS PROGRAM AND

02:59:19.549 --> 02:59:23.052 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH

02:59:21.117 --> 02:59:24.821 region:rollup2
THAT WERE SO DEEP THAT IT WOULD

02:59:23.052 --> 02:59:26.656 region:rollup2
TAKE TIME TO TURN THIS PROGRAM

02:59:24.821 --> 02:59:28.257 region:rollup2
AROUND AND SO. WE UNDERSTOOD

02:59:26.656 --> 02:59:30.493 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEEDED TO HAVE PATIENTS

02:59:28.257 --> 02:59:32.128 region:rollup2
THAT BRINGING ONBOARD SO MANY

02:59:30.493 --> 02:59:33.496 region:rollup2
MORE STAFF WOULD TAKE TIME IT

02:59:32.128 --> 02:59:35.465 region:rollup2
WOULD PUT ADDITIONAL STRESS ON

02:59:33.496 --> 02:59:37.066 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING WORKFORCE WHO HAD

02:59:35.465 --> 02:59:39.235 region:rollup2
TO DO DOUBLE DUTY AND TRYING TO.

02:59:37.066 --> 02:59:40.803 region:rollup2
CLEAR BACKLOGS DEAL WITH THE

02:59:39.235 --> 02:59:42.639 region:rollup2
WITH THE EXISTING OVER WORK BUT

02:59:40.803 --> 02:59:45.475 region:rollup2
ALSO BRING NEW PEOPLE ONBOARD

02:59:42.639 --> 02:59:48.311 region:rollup2
AND TRAIN THEM. AND.

02:59:45.475 --> 02:59:50.647 region:rollup2
SO SO WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO

02:59:48.311 --> 02:59:52.115 region:rollup2
BALANCE OUT PATIENTS AND SORT OF

02:59:50.647 --> 02:59:55.885 region:rollup2
BRING THINGS TOGETHER.

02:59:52.115 --> 02:59:56.085 region:rollup2
OVERTIME WITH THAT SAID I WILL

02:59:55.885 --> 02:59:56.753 region:rollup2
SAY.

02:59:56.085 --> 02:59:57.587 region:rollup2
RETENTION IN THIS PROGRAM WILL

02:59:56.753 --> 02:59:59.656 region:rollup2
BE CHALLENGED BECAUSE THE

02:59:57.587 --> 03:00:00.790 region:rollup2
STATE'S P. STRUCTURE IS SO LOW

02:59:59.656 --> 03:00:02.525 region:rollup2
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T

03:00:00.790 --> 03:00:04.427 region:rollup2
HAVE A PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY

03:00:02.525 --> 03:00:06.396 region:rollup2
TO SORT OF BRING UP. THE THE

03:00:04.427 --> 03:00:07.597 region:rollup2
PAIN BUT JUST TO KIND OF PUT IT

03:00:06.396 --> 03:00:09.832 region:rollup2
IN CONTEXT

03:00:07.597 --> 03:00:11.801 region:rollup2
THE STATE IS PAYING A MASTER'S

03:00:09.832 --> 03:00:12.368 region:rollup2
LEVEL PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE AROUND

03:00:11.801 --> 03:00:14.437 region:rollup2
SIXTY SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND A

03:00:12.368 --> 03:00:16.606 region:rollup2
YEAR.

03:00:14.437 --> 03:00:18.675 region:rollup2
STARTING AND AND THE INDUSTRY

03:00:16.606 --> 03:00:20.476 region:rollup2
WRIT LARGE IS PAYING MUCH HIGHER

03:00:18.675 --> 03:00:23.012 region:rollup2
THAN THAT PIECE GALLON SO.

03:00:20.476 --> 03:00:25.248 region:rollup2
IT'S EASY TO RECRUIT AWAY A

03:00:23.012 --> 03:00:27.150 region:rollup2
HIGHLY EDUCATED VERY WELL

03:00:25.248 --> 03:00:28.051 region:rollup2
TRAINED PUBLIC HEALTH'S HEALTH

03:00:27.150 --> 03:00:29.519 region:rollup2
NURSE WHO'S GONE THROUGH THE

03:00:28.051 --> 03:00:30.653 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF UNDERSTANDING ALL THE

03:00:29.519 --> 03:00:32.755 region:rollup2
STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND

03:00:30.653 --> 03:00:33.856 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS THAT APPLY. AND SO I

03:00:32.755 --> 03:00:35.058 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS JUST A

03:00:33.856 --> 03:00:37.126 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO

03:00:35.058 --> 03:00:38.628 region:rollup2

03:00:37.126 --> 03:00:40.430 region:rollup2
AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

03:00:38.628 --> 03:00:40.863 region:rollup2
WITH THE STATE TO TRY TO ENSURE

03:00:40.430 --> 03:00:42.198 region:rollup2
THAT WE GET GREATER

03:00:40.863 --> 03:00:43.933 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY.

03:00:42.198 --> 03:00:46.135 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE MEET OUR COMMON GOAL

03:00:43.933 --> 03:00:47.870 region:rollup2
OF IMPROVING SERVICE TO THE

03:00:46.135 --> 03:00:49.405 region:rollup2

REGULATED BY THE STATE WHILE

03:00:49.405 --> 03:00:53.343 region:rollup2
ALSO ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC IS

03:00:51.374 --> 03:00:54.510 region:rollup2
KEPT SAFE IN QUALITY FACILITIES

03:00:53.343 --> 03:00:55.345 region:rollup2

THANK YOU MA'AM.

03:00:57.647 --> 03:00:59.716 region:rollup2

I ACT. WE CAN HAVE THIS

03:01:13.363 --> 03:01:16.265 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION OVER AND OVER AGAIN

03:01:14.764 --> 03:01:18.334 region:rollup2

03:01:32.014 --> 03:01:34.917 region:rollup2
TEACHER SHORTAGE. AND THAT THERE

03:01:33.816 --> 03:01:36.953 region:rollup2
WAS A POINT WHERE WE COULDN'T

03:01:34.917 --> 03:01:38.054 region:rollup2
RECRUIT ENOUGH TEACHERS WE HAD

03:01:36.953 --> 03:01:40.289 region:rollup2
QUITE A STATE AND WE HAVE TO GO

03:01:38.054 --> 03:01:42.458 region:rollup2
OUT OF. THE COUNTRY TO RECRUITS

03:01:40.289 --> 03:01:43.793 region:rollup2
ON THESE FOLKS NOW MY CONCERN

03:01:42.458 --> 03:01:45.795 region:rollup2
HERE IS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I

03:01:45.795 --> 03:01:48.164 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT THE.

03:01:47.530 --> 03:01:50.032 region:rollup2
.

03:01:48.164 --> 03:01:51.400 region:rollup2
PATIENT IS OF CONCERN BUT ALSO

03:01:50.032 --> 03:01:52.735 region:rollup2
MY CONCERN IS WHERE WE CAN FIND

03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:55.171 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE.

03:01:52.735 --> 03:01:56.706 region:rollup2
FOLKS TOO UP FILL THESE

03:01:55.171 --> 03:01:58.608 region:rollup2
POSITIONS AND WHAT IS THE

03:01:56.706 --> 03:02:00.243 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT DOING YOU KNOW ASIDE

03:01:58.608 --> 03:02:02.378 region:rollup2
FROM PAYING MORE OUT WHAT ELSE

03:02:00.243 --> 03:02:04.013 region:rollup2
CAN WE DO. TO RECRUIT THESE

03:02:02.378 --> 03:02:05.681 region:rollup2
FOLKS BECAUSE I HAVE.

03:02:04.013 --> 03:02:07.517 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE SKILLED NURSING

03:02:05.681 --> 03:02:09.385 region:rollup2
FACILITIES IN MY IN MY AYE

03:02:07.517 --> 03:02:10.153 region:rollup2
DISTRICT AND ELEVEN OF THOSE ARE

03:02:09.385 --> 03:02:11.954 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE.

03:02:10.153 --> 03:02:14.123 region:rollup2
JULY FIRST.

03:02:11.954 --> 03:02:15.625 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TRYING

03:02:14.123 --> 03:02:16.626 region:rollup2
I WENT TO VISIT A FEW OF THEM

03:02:15.625 --> 03:02:18.561 region:rollup2
AND THEY CAN'T RECRUIT FAST

03:02:16.626 --> 03:02:20.062 region:rollup2
ENOUGH I SEE SEVERAL PROBLEMS I

03:02:18.561 --> 03:02:21.831 region:rollup2
WAS ALSO A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER

03:02:20.062 --> 03:02:23.766 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THE. THE ESPECIALLY

03:02:21.831 --> 03:02:25.201 region:rollup2
CME PROGRAMS AT LEAST THE BASIC

03:02:23.766 --> 03:02:25.968 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT SCENE A PROGRAMS

03:02:25.201 --> 03:02:27.403 region:rollup2
WERE ELIMINATED DURING THE

03:02:25.968 --> 03:02:28.304 region:rollup2
BUDGET CRISIS AND HAVE NOT BEEN

03:02:27.403 --> 03:02:31.774 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP.

AREA SOME OF THOSE.

03:02:36.312 --> 03:02:40.950 region:rollup2
UP PROGRAMS WERE ELIMINATED AND

03:02:42.118 --> 03:02:46.489 region:rollup2
HOW OLD ARE WE ASKING FOLKS TO

03:02:44.887 --> 03:02:48.124 region:rollup2

03:02:48.124 --> 03:02:51.761 region:rollup2
I DID HEAR THAT THERE WAS SOME

03:02:49.759 --> 03:02:52.328 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR TRAINING

03:02:51.761 --> 03:02:53.596 region:rollup2
BUT WHERE THE PEOPLE COMING

03:02:52.328 --> 03:02:54.697 region:rollup2
FROM.

03:02:53.596 --> 03:02:55.565 region:rollup2
WE CAN HAVE ALL THE MONEY IN THE

03:02:54.697 --> 03:02:57.533 region:rollup2

BEATEN.

03:03:18.754 --> 03:03:22.158 region:rollup2

LET ME JUMP IN JUST FOR A SECOND

03:06:10.259 --> 03:06:13.262 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE GOVERNOR

03:06:14.897 --> 03:06:16.732 region:rollup2
A HALF MILLION.

03:06:16.165 --> 03:06:17.666 region:rollup2

SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEED.

03:06:31.847 --> 03:06:35.017 region:rollup2
I APOLOGIZE THAT I'M NOT

03:06:33.249 --> 03:06:36.819 region:rollup2

TOGETHER WITH THE REALITY OF

03:07:16.358 --> 03:07:19.361 region:rollup2
THIS DEBT DOES.

03:07:17.359 --> 03:07:20.596 region:rollup2
DATE.

03:07:19.361 --> 03:07:22.398 region:rollup2
TO COMPLY SO.

03:07:20.596 --> 03:07:24.533 region:rollup2
TWO POINTS OF CLARIFICATION.

03:07:22.398 --> 03:07:26.068 region:rollup2
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IN AND

03:07:24.533 --> 03:07:28.304 region:rollup2
CLARIFY SOME THINGS. THE

03:07:26.068 --> 03:07:29.805 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION DEADLINE FOR THIS

03:07:28.304 --> 03:07:31.574 region:rollup2
NEW STAFFING RATIO.

03:07:29.805 --> 03:07:33.342 region:rollup2
IS IN THE LEGISLATION.

03:07:31.574 --> 03:07:35.044 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT SET BY THE DEPARTMENT

03:07:33.342 --> 03:07:36.011 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE WE ARE ONLY YOU

03:07:35.044 --> 03:07:36.879 region:rollup2
KNOW WE ARE BOUND BY THE

03:07:36.011 --> 03:07:38.881 region:rollup2
TIMELINE THAT'S IN THE

03:07:36.879 --> 03:07:40.382 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION AND. THE OTHER PIECE

03:07:38.881 --> 03:07:41.550 region:rollup2
ON THE ON THE WAIVERS WE HEARD A

03:07:40.382 --> 03:07:42.718 region:rollup2
LOT OF TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW

03:07:41.550 --> 03:07:43.953 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL NEED WAIVERS IN THE

03:07:42.718 --> 03:07:45.788 region:rollup2
BEGINNING AND WHAT KIND OF

03:07:43.953 --> 03:07:47.423 region:rollup2
WAIVERS AND CONCERNS WITH THE

03:07:45.788 --> 03:07:47.957 region:rollup2
WAIVERS. AND I WOULD JUST I

03:07:47.423 --> 03:07:51.193 region:rollup2
REMIND.

03:07:47.957 --> 03:07:52.294 region:rollup2
THAT COMMITTEE AGAIN THAT.

03:07:51.193 --> 03:07:53.796 region:rollup2
THE WAIVER PROCESS THE

03:07:52.294 --> 03:07:55.331 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS

03:07:53.796 --> 03:07:57.433 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THESE TWO DIFFERENT

03:07:55.331 --> 03:07:59.535 region:rollup2
KINDS OF WAIVERS IS ALSO IN THE

03:07:57.433 --> 03:08:00.870 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION AND THE LEGISLATION.

03:07:59.535 --> 03:08:02.605 region:rollup2
MAKES IT INCUMBENT ON THE

03:08:00.870 --> 03:08:04.173 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP A WAIVER

03:08:02.605 --> 03:08:05.407 region:rollup2
PROCESS SO IT'S NOT OUR CHOICE

03:08:04.173 --> 03:08:07.009 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE

03:08:05.407 --> 03:08:08.878 region:rollup2
WAIVERS OR SHOULD NOT BE WAIVERS

03:08:07.009 --> 03:08:10.012 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATION REQUIRES. THAT

03:08:08.878 --> 03:08:14.550 region:rollup2
WE DEVELOP PROCESSES FOR

03:08:10.012 --> 03:08:16.652 region:rollup2
GRANTING WAIVERS.

03:08:14.550 --> 03:08:18.521 region:rollup2
OKAY BUT IT SOLD SO THANK YOU

03:08:16.652 --> 03:08:20.489 region:rollup2
BYE UP THE QUESTION STILL

03:08:18.521 --> 03:08:21.724 region:rollup2
REMAINS WHERE WE CAN MAKE IT.

03:08:20.489 --> 03:08:23.459 region:rollup2
I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION WHAT

03:08:21.724 --> 03:08:25.794 region:rollup2
IS THE PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:08:23.459 --> 03:08:28.197 region:rollup2
THAT IF THESE WAIVERS ARE.

03:08:25.794 --> 03:08:29.231 region:rollup2
ISSUED THEN THEN WHAT WHAT

03:08:28.197 --> 03:08:32.434 region:rollup2
HAPPENS.

03:08:29.231 --> 03:08:34.136 region:rollup2
TO ENCOURAGE OUR INCENTIVIZE OF

03:08:32.434 --> 03:08:35.638 region:rollup2
THE WAIVERS BECAUSE THAT WHAT

03:08:34.136 --> 03:08:37.373 region:rollup2
WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME IS

03:08:35.638 --> 03:08:39.508 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA GIVE WAIVERS RIGHT.

03:08:37.373 --> 03:08:41.343 region:rollup2
BUT THEN IF THERE'S NO PLAN TO

03:08:39.508 --> 03:08:42.611 region:rollup2
FILL THOSE POSITIONS THEN. AND

03:08:41.343 --> 03:08:44.079 region:rollup2
ANOTHER YOUR WORK AND ASKING FOR

03:08:42.611 --> 03:08:45.514 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WAIVER THAT'S NOT THE

03:08:44.079 --> 03:08:47.383 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF THAT THE WAIVER THE

03:08:45.514 --> 03:08:48.450 region:rollup2
WAIVER IS. THIS IS THE PLAN THIS

03:08:47.383 --> 03:08:50.352 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WE'RE I MEAN I'M

03:08:48.450 --> 03:08:52.588 region:rollup2
ASSUMING RIGHT THAT IF YOU ISSUE

03:08:50.352 --> 03:08:53.656 region:rollup2
A WAIVER THEN THE PLAN YOU HAVE

03:08:52.588 --> 03:08:55.491 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A PLAN ON HOW YOU'RE

03:08:53.656 --> 03:08:57.193 region:rollup2
GOING TO COMPLY BY EX.

03:08:55.491 --> 03:08:59.361 region:rollup2
PICK A DATE.

03:08:57.193 --> 03:09:01.063 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHERE MY CONCERN IS

03:08:59.361 --> 03:09:01.664 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT

03:09:01.063 --> 03:09:03.065 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION WAS A IMPLEMENTED

03:09:01.664 --> 03:09:05.000 region:rollup2
BY.

03:09:03.065 --> 03:09:07.036 region:rollup2
YOUR.

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:08.571 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S HERE. SO YOU HAVE THE

03:09:07.036 --> 03:09:10.639 region:rollup2
SAME PRESSURE AS THE FACILITIES

03:09:08.571 --> 03:09:11.640 region:rollup2
TO TO TO TRY AND COME TOGETHER

03:09:10.639 --> 03:09:12.875 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN FIND THE A

03:09:11.640 --> 03:09:13.776 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO.

03:09:12.875 --> 03:09:15.177 region:rollup2
SO LET ME TURN IT OVER TO SEE

03:09:13.776 --> 03:09:17.046 region:rollup2
JAY HOWARD TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT

03:09:15.177 --> 03:09:18.080 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED IN

03:09:17.046 --> 03:09:19.849 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS ABOUT WHAT

03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:20.783 region:rollup2
WE ENVISION THE WAIVER PROCESS

03:09:19.849 --> 03:09:22.151 region:rollup2
WOULD LOOK LIKE ABOUT WHO WE'LL

03:09:20.783 --> 03:09:23.686 region:rollup2
GET THEM. HOWLONG THEY WOULD

03:09:22.151 --> 03:09:25.120 region:rollup2
LAST THE CONDITIONS FOR GETTING

03:09:23.686 --> 03:09:26.055 region:rollup2
THEM?

03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:29.158 region:rollup2
IS THAT WOULD THAT BE.

03:09:26.055 --> 03:09:31.327 region:rollup2
PUPPET YOUR QUESTION.

03:09:29.158 --> 03:09:33.195 region:rollup2
SO THE LEGISLATION REQUIRES US

03:09:31.327 --> 03:09:34.530 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT THREE POINT FIVE

03:09:33.195 --> 03:09:36.198 region:rollup2
AND TWO POINT FOUR SO WE'RE

03:09:34.530 --> 03:09:37.633 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE NURSING HOURS PER

03:09:36.198 --> 03:09:38.767 region:rollup2
PATIENT DAY FROM THREE POINT TO

03:09:37.633 --> 03:09:40.569 region:rollup2
TURN OVER ALL OF THREE POINT

03:09:38.767 --> 03:09:41.871 region:rollup2
FIVE AND TWO POINT FOUR OF THOSE

03:09:40.569 --> 03:09:43.606 region:rollup2
HOURS MUST BE PROVIDED BY

03:09:41.871 --> 03:09:44.873 region:rollup2
CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS.

03:09:43.606 --> 03:09:46.909 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATION ALLOWS FOR TWO

03:09:44.873 --> 03:09:48.544 region:rollup2
WAIVERS TO THE REVISED STANDARD

03:09:46.909 --> 03:09:50.312 region:rollup2
SO ONE IS A WAIVER TO THE TWO

03:09:48.544 --> 03:09:51.747 region:rollup2
POINT FOUR CM A REQUIREMENT

03:09:50.312 --> 03:09:53.482 region:rollup2
BASED ON PATIENT ACUITY.

03:09:51.747 --> 03:09:54.950 region:rollup2
SORT OTHER WORDS OF FACILITY

03:09:53.482 --> 03:09:56.619 region:rollup2
WOULD STILL NEED TO MEET THREE

03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:58.587 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE BUT BASED OFF OF

03:09:56.619 --> 03:09:59.655 region:rollup2
THEIR PATIENT MIX FOR THE ACUITY

03:09:58.587 --> 03:10:01.490 region:rollup2
OF THEIR PATIENTS THEY MIGHT

03:09:59.655 --> 03:10:03.425 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE ARE ENDS IN LV ENDS

03:10:01.490 --> 03:10:04.026 region:rollup2
AND FEWER SEEN AS IF THEY'RE

03:10:03.425 --> 03:10:04.693 region:rollup2
STILL MADE IN THE THREE POINT

03:10:04.026 --> 03:10:06.095 region:rollup2
FIVE.

03:10:04.693 --> 03:10:07.329 region:rollup2
THE SECOND WAIVER.

03:10:06.095 --> 03:10:09.398 region:rollup2
ALLOWS OF FACILITY TO WAVE TO

03:10:07.329 --> 03:10:11.166 region:rollup2
POINT FOUR AND OR THREE POINT

03:10:09.398 --> 03:10:12.801 region:rollup2
FIVE PROVIDED THEY STILL ME AND

03:10:11.166 --> 03:10:14.336 region:rollup2
OVERALL STAFFING LEVELS THREE

03:10:12.801 --> 03:10:15.537 region:rollup2
POINT TO USE OF THE CURRENT OR

03:10:14.336 --> 03:10:17.640 region:rollup2
EXISTING STANDARD.

03:10:15.537 --> 03:10:18.974 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENTS HELD FOR PUBLIC

03:10:17.640 --> 03:10:20.576 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS TO

03:10:18.974 --> 03:10:21.877 region:rollup2
AGGREGATE AT THAT.

03:10:20.576 --> 03:10:24.013 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

03:10:21.877 --> 03:10:24.580 region:rollup2
AND IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD

03:10:24.013 --> 03:10:25.514 region:rollup2
GO ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THESE

03:10:24.580 --> 03:10:27.116 region:rollup2
WAIVERS.

03:10:25.514 --> 03:10:28.651 region:rollup2
THE MATERIALS FROM ALL THESE

03:10:27.116 --> 03:10:30.419 region:rollup2
ARE INTERNET AND WE WILL BE

03:10:28.651 --> 03:10:31.553 region:rollup2
RELEASING SO THE WAY THAT THIS

03:10:30.419 --> 03:10:32.655 region:rollup2
WHOLE ALL COME TOGETHER IS

03:10:31.553 --> 03:10:34.189 region:rollup2
THROUGH A COMBINATION OF

03:10:32.655 --> 03:10:35.858 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND ALL

03:10:34.189 --> 03:10:37.993 region:rollup2
FACILITIES LETTERS. AND THAT'LL

03:10:35.858 --> 03:10:40.162 region:rollup2
BE RELEASED BY MARCH THIRTIETH.

03:10:37.993 --> 03:10:41.797 region:rollup2
.

03:10:40.162 --> 03:10:43.365 region:rollup2
SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING

03:10:41.797 --> 03:10:45.200 region:rollup2
FOR IN THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE

03:10:43.365 --> 03:10:47.636 region:rollup2
WAIVER IS FOR THE FACILITY TO

03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:48.604 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE A IS A

03:10:47.636 --> 03:10:50.372 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE SHORTAGE IN THEIR

03:10:48.604 --> 03:10:53.442 region:rollup2
REGION. AND BE THAT THEY HAVE

03:10:50.372 --> 03:10:55.210 region:rollup2
MADE. STRIDENT EFFORTS TO HIRE

03:10:53.442 --> 03:10:57.613 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF STAFF AND

03:10:55.210 --> 03:10:59.081 region:rollup2
THEN THE IN SCRANTON THE WAIVERS

03:10:57.613 --> 03:11:00.449 region:rollup2
OF CURRENTLY OUTLINED THE NEED

03:10:59.081 --> 03:11:01.917 region:rollup2
TO SHOW US A SERIES OF STEPS

03:11:00.449 --> 03:11:02.518 region:rollup2
THAT THEY PLAN TO TAKE TO FULLY

03:11:01.917 --> 03:11:04.386 region:rollup2
STAFF AND TO BE FULLY STAFFED

03:11:02.518 --> 03:11:05.587 region:rollup2
AT.

03:11:04.386 --> 03:11:07.389 region:rollup2
TWO POINT FOUR AND THREE POINT

03:11:05.587 --> 03:11:09.625 region:rollup2
FIVE AND THEY CAN ONLY RENEW THE

03:11:07.389 --> 03:11:12.428 region:rollup2
WAIVER FOR AND A LIMITED NUMBER

03:11:09.625 --> 03:11:14.096 region:rollup2
OF YEARS.

03:11:12.428 --> 03:11:15.464 region:rollup2
SO THREE SO YOU GET A FEW

03:11:14.096 --> 03:11:16.665 region:rollup2
THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR IT IN

03:11:15.464 --> 03:11:18.200 region:rollup2
THE CAR PROPOSAL AN INITIAL

03:11:16.665 --> 03:11:19.335 region:rollup2
WAIVER AND TWO RENEWALS AND

03:11:18.200 --> 03:11:20.536 region:rollup2
AFTER THREE YEARS YOU WOULD NOT

03:11:19.335 --> 03:11:21.904 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO GET A WAIVER. AND

03:11:20.536 --> 03:11:23.472 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PIECE OF GRANTING THE

03:11:21.904 --> 03:11:25.174 region:rollup2
WAIVERS THAT THE FACILITY

03:11:23.472 --> 03:11:26.141 region:rollup2
REQUESTING A WAIVER ACOSTA HAS

03:11:25.174 --> 03:11:27.876 region:rollup2
TO DEMONSTRATE.

03:11:26.141 --> 03:11:29.912 region:rollup2
TO THE DEPARTMENT IT'S

03:11:27.876 --> 03:11:31.814 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S PLAN FOR ASSURING

03:11:29.912 --> 03:11:32.981 region:rollup2
THAT IT CAN PROVIDE. PROPER CARE

03:11:31.814 --> 03:11:36.118 region:rollup2
TO THE RESIDENTS AT THE LOWER

03:11:32.981 --> 03:11:37.853 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

03:11:36.118 --> 03:11:38.454 region:rollup2
JUMP IN FOR A SECOND IF I CAN.

03:11:37.853 --> 03:11:40.222 region:rollup2
FIRST I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE

03:11:38.454 --> 03:11:41.990 region:rollup2
TO.

03:11:40.222 --> 03:11:43.625 region:rollup2
MAKE UP STATEMENT THAT WERE ON

03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:45.127 region:rollup2
BOARD WITH SUPPORTING THAT

03:11:43.625 --> 03:11:46.895 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND WANTS TO

03:11:45.127 --> 03:11:48.564 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT.

03:11:46.895 --> 03:11:50.766 region:rollup2
ALL INTERESTS ARE PRESENT IN

03:11:48.564 --> 03:11:51.200 region:rollup2
ABLE TO BE HEARD AND THAT WE ARE

03:11:50.766 --> 03:11:51.867 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD IN A

03:11:51.200 --> 03:11:53.635 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTIVE.

03:11:51.867 --> 03:11:55.204 region:rollup2
PATTERN.

03:11:53.635 --> 03:11:58.374 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THE GOAL IS TO GET TO

03:11:55.204 --> 03:11:59.007 region:rollup2
THREE POINT FIVE AND REALLY WHAT

03:11:58.374 --> 03:12:00.743 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE MISSING HAS

03:11:59.007 --> 03:12:02.745 region:rollup2
HOW.

03:12:00.743 --> 03:12:04.146 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

03:12:02.745 --> 03:12:05.280 region:rollup2
IF THE FOREIGN A HALF MILLION

03:12:04.146 --> 03:12:06.648 region:rollup2
THAT WAS INSERTED IN THE

03:12:05.280 --> 03:12:08.717 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WILL BE

03:12:06.648 --> 03:12:11.020 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT TO REACH THAT GOAL.

03:12:08.717 --> 03:12:12.021 region:rollup2
AND IF NOT IS THERE A NECESSITY

03:12:11.020 --> 03:12:13.722 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO

03:12:12.021 --> 03:12:16.024 region:rollup2
STEP UP.

03:12:13.722 --> 03:12:17.526 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE

03:12:16.024 --> 03:12:19.161 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE STAFFING RATIO TO

03:12:17.526 --> 03:12:20.529 region:rollup2
PROTECT

03:12:19.161 --> 03:12:23.365 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITY AND RESIDENTS OF

03:12:20.529 --> 03:12:24.633 region:rollup2
NURSING HOMES.

03:12:23.365 --> 03:12:25.934 region:rollup2
HAS JUST BEEN A BAD ONE EITHER.

03:12:24.633 --> 03:12:27.770 region:rollup2
.

03:12:25.934 --> 03:12:28.137 region:rollup2
POINT OF INTEREST WHICH IS THAT

03:12:27.770 --> 03:12:29.905 region:rollup2
MY.

03:12:28.137 --> 03:12:30.973 region:rollup2
MEDICAL COLLEAGUES HAVE TOLD ME

03:12:29.905 --> 03:12:32.074 region:rollup2
THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

03:12:30.973 --> 03:12:34.410 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL

03:12:32.074 --> 03:12:35.878 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION OF TWENTY ONE POINT

03:12:34.410 --> 03:12:38.680 region:rollup2
SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND.

AND AND HOW SLOW THAT PROCESS

03:15:55.344 --> 03:16:00.682 region:rollup2
IS.

03:15:57.379 --> 03:16:01.917 region:rollup2
CAN EXPLAIN WHY THAT PROCESS IS.

03:16:00.682 --> 03:16:03.485 region:rollup2
SO SLOW ARE THEY HAVING TO FILL

03:16:01.917 --> 03:16:05.087 region:rollup2

BE OF WHICH I HAVE FROM PEOPLE

03:16:09.691 --> 03:16:12.594 region:rollup2
IN MY DISTRICT IS THAT THAT IS.

03:16:11.493 --> 03:16:13.829 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE CERTIFICATES OR

THEY CAN'T GET THERE RENEWAL

03:16:18.667 --> 03:16:23.572 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT IS TAKING

03:16:20.969 --> 03:16:25.374 region:rollup2
SO LONG TO GET INTO. SO LIKE I

03:16:23.572 --> 03:16:27.109 region:rollup2

YET WE'RE HEARING ANECDOTALLY

03:16:36.284 --> 03:16:40.589 region:rollup2

03:16:38.220 --> 03:16:42.224 region:rollup2
TO GET RENEWALS FOR CNN SO.

03:16:40.589 --> 03:16:43.158 region:rollup2

THAT SO THAT WE CAN?

03:16:46.461 --> 03:16:50.165 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE THE WORKFORCE WE

03:16:47.729 --> 03:16:52.000 region:rollup2
HAVE BE ABLE TO WORK IN THE AND

03:16:50.165 --> 03:16:52.601 region:rollup2

CARE.

03:16:54.002 --> 03:16:57.406 region:rollup2
AND MY COLLEAGUE ANSWER THAT

03:16:55.170 --> 03:16:58.674 region:rollup2
QUESTION FOR YOU. SO THE THE

03:16:57.406 --> 03:17:00.275 region:rollup2
CURRENT PROCESS IS A PAPER BASED

03:16:58.674 --> 03:17:01.576 region:rollup2
PROCESS ROUGHLY FOUR MONTHS

03:17:00.275 --> 03:17:03.145 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO THE C. N. A.'S

03:17:01.576 --> 03:17:04.746 region:rollup2
EXPIRATION WE SEND OUT A NOTICE

REMIND IN THE C. N. A THAT IT'S

03:17:04.746 --> 03:17:08.383 region:rollup2
TIME FOR THEM TO RENEW.

03:17:06.181 --> 03:17:11.720 region:rollup2
.

03:17:08.383 --> 03:17:14.056 region:rollup2
BACK IN THE SUMMER AND NOVEMBER

03:17:11.720 --> 03:17:15.957 region:rollup2
OUR PROCESSING TIME HAD BECOME

03:17:14.056 --> 03:17:17.459 region:rollup2
QUITE A FLAG PILLARS UPWARDS OF

03:17:15.957 --> 03:17:20.195 region:rollup2
THIRTY DAYS FOR US TO TURN

03:17:17.459 --> 03:17:21.830 region:rollup2
AROUND. TO TURN AROUND OF THE

03:17:20.195 --> 03:17:23.398 region:rollup2
REVIEW OF THE APPLICATION AYE

03:17:21.830 --> 03:17:24.933 region:rollup2
WE'VE SUBSEQUENTLY DRIVEN THAT

03:17:23.398 --> 03:17:26.268 region:rollup2
PROCESS DOWN TO TWO OR THREE

03:17:24.933 --> 03:17:27.569 region:rollup2
DAYS THE LAST REPORT THAT I GOT

03:17:26.268 --> 03:17:29.304 region:rollup2
TODAY WAS IT WEIRD NOW TURNING

03:17:27.569 --> 03:17:30.639 region:rollup2
THOSE AROUND AND THREE DAYS THAT

03:17:29.304 --> 03:17:32.441 region:rollup2
JUST MEANS OF THAT. THAT DOESN'T

03:17:30.639 --> 03:17:33.275 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT IT WAS APPROVED WITHIN

03:17:32.441 --> 03:17:34.543 region:rollup2
THREE DAYS IT COULD BE THAT

03:17:33.275 --> 03:17:35.911 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT AN INCOMPLETE

03:17:34.543 --> 03:17:37.913 region:rollup2
APPLICATION BUT WILL LET BURDENS

03:17:35.911 --> 03:17:39.481 region:rollup2
HAVE A TURN AROUND TIME A VOLLEY

03:17:37.913 --> 03:17:40.949 region:rollup2
OF THIRTY FIVE DAYS IT'S NOW

03:17:39.481 --> 03:17:42.551 region:rollup2
DOWN TO TWO OR THREE. SO IT'S

03:17:40.949 --> 03:17:44.419 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE WE ARE

03:17:42.551 --> 03:17:46.488 region:rollup2
MOVING WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR OR

03:17:44.419 --> 03:17:48.323 region:rollup2
SO TO AN ONLINE APPLICATION

03:17:46.488 --> 03:17:49.758 region:rollup2
SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE

03:17:48.323 --> 03:17:52.728 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WE GET

03:17:49.758 --> 03:17:53.795 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS AN ERROR OR

03:17:52.728 --> 03:17:54.496 region:rollup2
INCOMPLETE APPLICATIONS.

03:17:53.795 --> 03:17:56.331 region:rollup2
SO THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET IT

03:17:54.496 --> 03:17:57.799 region:rollup2
IN THE FIRST TIME AND WE CAN BE

03:17:56.331 --> 03:17:59.368 region:rollup2
APPROVING THE SCENE A RENEWALS

03:17:57.799 --> 03:18:01.236 region:rollup2
IN A MATTER OF DAYS RATHER THAN

03:17:59.368 --> 03:18:02.938 region:rollup2
A MATTER OF MONTHS OR WEEKS.

03:18:01.236 --> 03:18:04.740 region:rollup2
I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT WE ARE

03:18:02.938 --> 03:18:06.775 region:rollup2
MONITORING HONOR ON A WEEKLY

03:18:04.740 --> 03:18:08.510 region:rollup2
BASIS THE TURN AROUND TIME OF

03:18:06.775 --> 03:18:10.512 region:rollup2
THOSE APPLICATION RENAULT SO

03:18:08.510 --> 03:18:12.114 region:rollup2
IT'S THIS IS A HIGH. PRIORITY ON

PROPOSAL WILL END UP BEING IT

03:36:41.222 --> 03:36:43.958 region:rollup2
SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S SOME

03:36:42.122 --> 03:36:45.426 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION.

03:36:43.958 --> 03:36:46.927 region:rollup2
BUT FOR HOSPITALS ARE FEES ARE

03:36:45.426 --> 03:36:48.762 region:rollup2
BEING RAISED IN THE LA COUNTY

03:36:46.927 --> 03:36:50.464 region:rollup2

FOR THE HOSPITALS AND IT'S NOT

03:36:52.199 --> 03:36:55.402 region:rollup2
CLEAR TO US WHY THIS IS

03:36:53.934 --> 03:36:56.837 region:rollup2
NECESSARY BECAUSE SO MUCH WITH

03:36:55.402 --> 03:36:59.673 region:rollup2
THE WORKLOAD.

03:36:56.837 --> 03:37:01.709 region:rollup2
IS NOT DONE BY THE LA COUNTY IN

03:36:59.673 --> 03:37:02.643 region:rollup2

03:37:12.286 --> 03:37:14.655 region:rollup2

03:37:14.655 --> 03:37:18.926 region:rollup2

YEAR OR TWO FROM NOW HOW MUCH

03:37:18.926 --> 03:37:22.630 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE WORKLOAD WILL END UP

03:37:20.794 --> 03:37:24.298 region:rollup2
COSTING IN LA COUNTY BECAUSE

03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:25.566 region:rollup2

IT SEEMS LIKE THIS BUDGET

03:37:35.542 --> 03:37:40.414 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL NEEDS A BIT MORE WORK

03:37:38.178 --> 03:37:41.682 region:rollup2
