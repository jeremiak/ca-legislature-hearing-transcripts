SERVICES INDUSTRY MUST PLAY A HELPFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN A DRESSING SOME OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN OUR SOCIETY SUCH AS ANY QUALITY. STRUCTURAL RACISM AND EVEN CLIMATE CHANGE. IMPACT INVESTING IS ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION AND I'M EAGER TO LEARN MORE FROM OUR SPEAKER TODAY ABOUT ITS POTENTIAL- TOO. MEANINGFUL SUPPORT- THE- FOR THESE LONG TERM SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS.

MISTER WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE BBC IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN BRITAIN AND BY FORTUNE MAGAZINE AS ONE OF THE FIFTY MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS. MS DREW RECEIVED A BA IN FINANCE AND MARKETING WITH DISTINCTION FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA'S MCINTIRE SCHOOL OF COMMERCE AN MBA WITH DISTINCTION FROM THE WHARTON SCHOOL AND SHE JOINS US FROM HER HOME IN CONNECTICUT THIS AFTERNOON. MISTRUTH ACTUALLY THIS EVENING FOR YOU AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU MAKING THE EFFORT DECEIVING- ON YOUR- NON WORKING HOURS TO JOIN US MR. TO MR WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE AND YOUR EVENING ASKED TO SPEND TIME WITH US TODAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEN THAT AND- THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE PARTICIPATING TODAY SESSION THAT'S MY ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO BE HERE. SO YOU WOULD ASK ME- A LITTLE BIT I GUESS IS AS AN OPENING QUESTION ABOUT THE FIELD OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND WHERE THIS IS ALL HEADED SO- MAYBE I WILL START THERE. IN TERMS OF A LITTLE BIT OF LEVEL SETTING AND SOME TERMINOLOGY JUST SO THAT- WE'RE ALL SPEAKING SO TO SPEAK FROM THE SAME HYMN SHEET. ON THE SO FIRST OF ALL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE FIELD OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND SOMETIMES I THINK THAT THIS IS- IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT NEEDS TO BE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT THIS DEFINITION ONLY. IS- A REALLY SUSTAINABLE FINANCES A TOOL THROUGH WHICH INVESTORS CAN BOTH MITIGATE RISK AND IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT IS BY LOOKING AT THE S. N. G. FACTOR SO ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE FACTORS. IN INCORPORATE THOSE INTO INVESTMENT STRATEGIES ALONGSIDE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL METRICS SO THE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE HERE IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUSTAINABLE FINANCE THIS IS RETURNS BASED INVESTING SO THOSE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING ARE EXPECTING TO GENERATE A RETURN. AND I WOULD SAY FOR THE VAST PREPONDERANCE OF SUSTAINABLE INVESTORS THEY'RE SEEKING TO GENERATE A MARKET RATE OF RETURN FOR BETTER FROM THESE INVESTMENT SO- THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE PARTICIPATING IN THE SPACE ARE NOT LOOKING AT CONCESSIONARY RETURN AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- I THINK THERE'S A BIT OF A MISNOMER. THAT WHEN YOU GET INTO THE FIELD IMPACT INVESTING OR SOMETHING THAT IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE POSITIVE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES WITH CAPITAL THAT COMES AT A COST. AND WE WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT THAT IN MOST CASES ON A RISK ADJUSTED BASIS YOU CAN GENERATE OUTSIZE RETURNS BY TAKING THESE FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION. SO WITH THAT AS A BACKDROP AND IF I THINK ABOUT THE SPECTRUM OF FINANCE ON THE ONE HAND IF YOU THINK OF A GRID OR SPECTRUM. ON FAR LEFT WE THINK ABOUT TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ALL THOSE DO IS SEEK TO GENERATE A RISK ADJUSTED RETURNS. AND THEY ASK. NOTHING MORE OF THAT INVESTMENT THE TO GENERATE THAT WERE. AND THEN WE MOVE INTO THE FIELDS STAND OFF I. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO IS TO EITHER CREATE. ALIGNED INVESTMENT FOR TO DRIVE OUTCOMES. SO THE UMBRELLA TERMINOLOGY THAT MOST PEOPLE USES ESG INVESTING WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT SUSTAINABLE INVESTING. BUT THAT'S JUST A STARTING POINT AND WE WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS REALLY JUST GOOD HYGIENE. SO LOOKING ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE CHARACTERISTICS IN YOUR INVESTMENTS. LEADS YOU TO A PLACE WHERE YOU THEN CAN DECIDE WHETHER YOU'RE TRYING TO DRIVE REAL IMPACT. AND WE START TYPICALLY WITH EXCLUSIONS THAT'S THE SIMPLE PLACE TO GO. WHEREINVESTORS SAY I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE. ANY EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN THINGS IN MY PORTFOLIO THAT COULD BE WEAPONS THAT COULD BE TOBACCO COULD BE FOSSIL FUELS WE CALL THAT EXCLUSIONS. AND WE MOVED FROM EXPLOSIONS. FURTHER TO THE RIGHT AND WE TALK ABOUT ESG INTEGRATION WHERE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THOSE ESG FACTORS IN OUR PORTFOLIOS IN A MORE DELIBERATE WAY. AND THINKING ABOUT WHERE RISK MIGHT BE IDENTIFIED- OPPORTUNITIES pWE MOVE FURTHER TO THE RIGHT AND NOW WE'RE MOVING INTO THE WORLD OF IMPACT INVESTING. THIS IS A VERY DELIBERATE SPACE SO INVESTORS WITHIN IMPACTS ARE SAYING I WANT TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR SOCIAL OUTCOMES. AND I'M PREPARED TO MEASURE MYSELF AND HOLD MYSELF ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DELIVERY OF THOSE OUTCOMES AS WELL AS A FINANCIAL RETURN. SO WE SAY THE TENETS OF IMPACT INVESTING. OR INTENTIONALITY. MEASURE ABILITY OF IMPACT. AND REPORTING AND HOLDING YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE TO THE IMPACT. AND ALL BREAK IMPACT INVESTING DOWN THEN FURTHER INTO TWO CATEGORIES ONE WE CALL RETURNS FIRST AND THIS IS WHERE WE'RE FOCUSING ON MARKET RATE OF RETURN OR BETTER FORGET AN ASSET CLASS. AND THEN THERE'S THE IMPACT FIRST WHERE WE'RE FOCUSED ON DELIVERING A CERTAIN IMPACT AND BE PREPARED TO TAKE CONCESSIONARY RETURNS. BECAUSE THE CAPITAL. NEEDS TO BE CATALYTIC. AND I THE ALL OF THESE ARE. IN MAKING HOW. A STATE PURCHASE IN THE SPACE TO OUT. BUT THEN FINALLY AS WE MOVE FARTHER TO THE RIGHT WE MOVE INTO THE WORLD OF PHILANTHROPY- AND THAT IS WHERE YOU ARE GIVING MONEY AWAY AND NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING IN RETURN. AND ACROSS THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM FROM EXCLUSIONS THROUGH DELIBERATE IMPACT THERE'S A PLACE FOR EVERYBODY AND A COMBINATION IN DIVERSE PORTFOLIOS IN OUR OPINION. THAT STILL CAN A LINE WITH VALUES INVESTING AND I CAN STILL DRIVE OUTCOMES SO CONTEXTUALLY MAYBE I CAN JUST GIVE YOU A FLAVOR FOR THE SIZE OF THE OVERALL MARKET. SO THE OVERALL UMBRELLA OF SUSTAINABLE INVESTING- OUR EXPECTATION WHEN THE NEW STATISTICS ARE GOING TO COME OUT WHICH WOULD BE VERY SHORTLY. BUT IT WILL BE ABOUT EIGHT FIFTY TRILLION DOLLAR MARKET SO THAT'S CAPITAL INVESTED IN SUSTAINABLE STRATEGIES ACROSS THE BOARD SO FIFTY TRILLION. AND THE GROWTH RATE HAS BEEN NORTH OF A HUNDRED AND 75% ANNUALLY FOR EACH OF THE PAST FOUR TO FIVE YEARS SO EXTRAORDINARY ORGANIC GROWTH IN THIS MARKET. AND THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT A THIRD OF THE OVERALL FINANCIAL MARKETS. IN TERMS OF ANNUAL INVESTMENTS. OUR OF THAT IMPACTED. IS A VERY SMALL SUBSET TODAY THAT'S ABOUT A TRILLION DOLLAR MARKET. VERSUS THE FIFTY TRILLION OVERALL BUT ITS GROWTH RATE IS NORTH OF A 1000% SO COMING FROM A SMALL BASE BUT GROWING EXPONENTIALLY. AND WHY IS THAT WHY IS THAT HAPPENING IT'S BECAUSE I THINK IMPACT INVESTING IS CAPTURING THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY BECAUSE YOU CAN MEASURE OUTCOMES. AND THIS IS WHAT'S CAPTIVATING PEOPLE IF YOU CAN GENERATE A RETURN. THAT'S A MARKET RATE OR BETTER. AND YOU CAN ACHIEVE AN OUTCOME THAT'S MEASURABLE THAT'S CAUSING A POSITIVE OUTCOME ON THE ENVIRONMENT ARE ON SOCIETAL ISSUES WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE ABOUT THAT IT'S SORT OF THE- DOUBLE OR SOMETIMES PEOPLE CALL THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE SO WIN WIN FOR EVERYBODY. AND THOSE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS SPACE IT IS THE ENTIRE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. WE SEE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AT SCALE GETTING INVOLVED IN IMPACT. WE SEE SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS. PENSION FUNDS INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE LIKE SO IT'S REALLY VERY VERY DEEP AND BROAD BASED. AGAIN THE LARGEST COMPONENT THAT IS A STABLE INVESTING STRATEGIES BUT THIS IMPACT SPACE IS INCREASINGLY SOMETHING. WHERE INVESTORS ARE GETTING VERY EXCITED. ONE SMALL EXAMPLE OF THE SOVEREIGN WEALTH SIDE. IS THAT THIS YEAR OUT OF THAT- CIRCA TRILLION MARKET THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED. WE JUST HAD ANNOUNCEMENT SEVERAL WEEKS AGO THAT TOMASZ AND- THE ASIAN SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS. IS PUTTING FIVE HUNDRED- FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OF CAPITAL INTO ONE IMPACT FUND MANAGER BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO DRIVE SOCIAL OUTCOMES AND THEY WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE OUTCOMES. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS SIZE BONTA ON THAT WE'RE SEEING. SO OUR EVERY EXPECTATION IS THAT THESE GROWTH RATES WILL CONTINUE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE BECAUSE ALL OF FOUNDATIONS ARE THERE. WE SEE REGULATORY INTERVENTION POLICYMAKERS POLITICAL LEADERS ALL WANTING TO ADDRESS BIG SOCIETAL. ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE OR SOCIAL ENACT WHAT. AND DOING WHAT THEY CAN BROUGH AYE SAFELY WILL. IS GENERALLY MANIFEST IN REGULAR. I WERE SEEING REGULATE PROLIFERATE. ACROSS THE PIECE TO TRY TO DRIVE MORE CAPITAL GOING INTO THE SPACE SO LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I CAN SKIP AROUND THE WORLD IF YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT REGIONALLY WHERE WE'RE SEEING ACTIVITY. BUT I HAVE TO POINT PERSON FOR MOST OF THE E. U. THE EUROPEAN UNION NATION EXTRAORDINARY LEADERSHIP OF TRYING TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE INVESTING. SO MUCH SO THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS PUT IN PLACE REGULATIONS THAT CAME INTO PLACE JUST IN IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR. THAT SAYS THAT ANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION MONEY MANAGER ASSET MANAGER BANK THAT TOUCHES THE EUROPEAN UNION. MUST NOW DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY TAKE AN ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE CHARACTERISTICS INTO ACCOUNT IN ANY FINANCIAL PRODUCT THAT WE CREATE. OR ANY PIECE OF ADVICE THAT WE GIVE. AND THEY'RE ASKING US TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BY. PROVIDING SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS AND THAT IN ANY FINANCIAL DOCUMENTATION PROSPECTUS IS WHAT HAVE YOU WE'RE SHOWING THAT WE TAKING THESE FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION. SO ANY VIRTUALLY ANY GLOBAL INSTITUTION THAT DOES ANY BUSINESS WHATSOEVER AND YOU NOW HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THROUGH THIS PIECE OF REGULATION. WE'RE ALSO FACING REGULATION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY- AROUND DISCLOSURES THIS IS A VERY VERY BIG TOPIC OF THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY BECAUSE INVESTORS WANT MORE DISCLOSURE AROUND SUSTAINABILITY FACTORS. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO MAKE INFORMED INVESTMENT DECISIONS. SO WHAT STARTED AS A VOLUNTARY EFFORTS- CHAMPION BY THE GREAT MIKE BLOOMBERG ENDS AND MARK CARNEY WHICH IS THE T. C. F. T. THE TASK FORCE FOR CLIMATE RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. WHICH TODAY IS VOLUNTARY WILL SOON BECOME FOR ITS ALREADY EVERY EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FOR DISCLOSING OUR EXPOSURE TO CLIMATE. RELATED ISSUES BOTH INTO ARMS OF RISK BUT I OPPORTUNITY. WHERE WE CAN TRY- THIS. ISSUE OF CLIMATE INTO OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL GIVE US A MORE SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS I EAT IN THE BANKING SYSTEM ARE WE BANKING THE COMPANIES OF THE FUTURE AND OUR COGNIZANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO BANK COMPANIES. WHO WILL ULTIMATELY LOSE EQUITY VALUE AS OUR BUSINESSES GET USURPED BY GREENER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVES ARE WE AWARE OF THOSE RISKS AND THOSE EXPOSURES. SO T. C. F. T. NOT ONLY SPEAKS TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IT'S ALSO ASKED CORPORATES TO GO THROUGH THE SAME EXERCISE THINK ABOUT DEEPLY THEIR BUSINESSES WHERE THEY EXPOSED TO CLIMATE CHANGE WHERE ARE THERE RISKS. HAVE THEY DONE FINANCIAL MODELING SCENARIO MODELING UNDER DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE DEGREE SCENARIOS. WHAT MIGHT THOSE RISKS LOOK LIKE BUT ALSO WHERE THIS COMPANY'S CHANGING AND MIGRATING THEIR BUSINESSES TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENORMOUS I MEAN. IF YOU EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE BUT A SLIP BUT THAT I LIKE TO- SO OFTEN- GIVE. IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT A COMPANY LIKE CHINA A COUNTRY LIKE CHINA. THAT IS NOW COMMITTED TO NET. ZERO BY TWENTY FIFTY TWENTY SIXTY- IN SO DOING THEIR PROMOTING. ENTIRE INCLUDING ENTIRE INDUSTRIES OVERNIGHT BY SIMPLE STATEMENTS SO ONE BEING THEY CAMEOUT NOT TOO LONG AGO AND SAID THAT WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THEY'RE GOING TO. BAN ALL PETROL VEHICLES. SO THE MINUTE CHINA SAID. IN AS SHORT WINDOW OF TIME THEY'LL BAN PETROL CARS WHAT HAVE THEY DONE. THEY BASICALLY CREATED A MULTI HUNDRED BILLION INDUSTRY AND LECTER VEHICLES ANY COMPONENT PARTS TO MANUFACTURE ANY OEM MANUFACTURER ANY ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDER ALL OF THOSE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THE FACT THAT THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION AT MIDDLE CLASS CONSUMERS. THAT ALL STATE OWNED CARS IN CHINA ARE GOING TO NEED TO BUY ELECTRIC CARS SO THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY SET IF YOU'RE AN INVESTOR OR IF YOUR COMPANY IN THOSE INDUSTRIES OR IF YOU'RE A COUNTRY THAT'S TRYING TO PUSH. TOWARD A GREENER SOLUTION BY PROMOTING AND SUGGESTING THAT THOSE ARE THE INDUSTRIES OF THE FUTURE YOU CAN DRIVE OUTCOMES AND THAT'S WHERE THIS WHOLE IMPACT INVESTING MESHES WITH I THINK POLITICAL AND REGULATORY INTERVENTION. THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD POINT TO JUST IN TERMS OF NOMENCLATURE AND LEVEL SETTING IS ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE I THINK- WE ARE STILL CHALLENGED IF I'M HONEST AND SUSTAINABILITY FIELD. IS THERE IS NOT A COMMON DEFINITION FOR WHAT IS IMPACT OR INDEED WAS EVEN GROUP. AND A GOOD EXAMPLE- WOULD BE AN ELECTRIC DID LETTER VEHICLE INDUSTRY IF I LOOK AT MY CONSTITUENTS MY STAKEHOLDERS MANY OF MY INVESTORS. ABOUT HALF OF THEM WILL SAY TODAY- THEY PUT ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN THEIR SUSTAINABLE INVESTING BUCKET. BUT FULLY ANOTHER HALF OF MY INVESTORS WILL SAY THAT'S CORRECT WE'RE DRIVING TO A GREAT OUTCOME WITH THE HEAT. BUT TODAY WE'RE STILL RELIANT ON IMPORTS WHICH ARE DRIVEN FROM NON SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES SO BATTERY TECHNOLOGY IS STILL RELIANT ON BASE METALS MINING COBALT AND WHAT HAVE YOU. AND OFTENTIMES THOSE MINES ARE HIGHLY POLLUTING OR THEY'RE NOT SUSTAINABLE IN THE LABOR PRACTICES SO SOME OF THE INVESTORS WHO WANT TO GO MANY LEVELS DEEPER. DON'T YET PUT EVEY INTO THEIR SUSTAINABLE BUCKETS SO THIS MISMATCH OF DEFINITIONS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO I THINK COME TO SOME COMMON. AGREEMENT AROUND WHAT IS REALLY GREEN WHAT IS GREEN UP JACK WHAT IS TRENDS. AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORKING DONE IN THAT FIELD. BUT AND THE E. U. IS AGAIN SHOWING LEADERSHIP THERE WITH THE U. TAXONOMY THE GREEN TAXONOMY THEY WANT TO CREATE THOSE DEFINITIONS SO THAT WE CAN ALL BE SPEAKING ABOUT THE SAME THING WE TALK ABOUT INVESTING. IN A GREEN ALTERNATIVE- GREEN VESTMENT. THE OTHER AREA IN TERMS OF THE NOMENCLATURE THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS THE ESTEY JEEZ. WHAT THE U. ENDED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS TO TRY TO CATEGORIZE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CHALLENGES. INTO SEVENTEEN CATEGORIES. AND BY DOING THAT. THEY ALLOW THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY AT LARGE TO IDENTIFY WITH THOSE AREAS THAT SPOKE TO THEM MOST. SO SDG FIVE SEVEN AND NINE THAT COULD BE GENDER EQUALITY ACCESS TO EDUCATION. I ENDING POVERTY- CLARINET- GREEN ENERGY- SMART CITIES AND GRAY AND GREEN AND AFFORDABLE- AND- EDUCATION CITIES. SO I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT IS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS TOPIC. THAT YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE THE STATE MINUS ONE MIGHT WANT TO BE DRIVING OUTCOMES IN SPECIFIC CATEGORIES THAT WILL ALIGN THEMSELVES TO THE SDGS BECAUSE THAT'S THE LANGUAGE THAT THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY. AND THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY BROADLY ON THE CORPORATE MEDIA ARE USING TO TRY TO CATEGORIZE THE PLACES WHERE THEY WANT. TO PARTICIPATE AND DRIVE THOSE OUTCOMES- I GUESS- I HOPEFULLY SETTING A BIT IS BUT I US TO IN A BECAUSE I THINK THE GOING TO BE MOST PART FOR ALL OF YOU- I THINK I WILL MAYBE TURN TO THE NEXT QUESTION THAT WAS POSED TO ME BY SOMEONE THAT WHICH IS WHERE HAS THE LEGISLATURE GET INVOLVED AND TRY TO DRIVE. SOME OF THESE OUTCOMES. WELL ONE OF THE BIG AREAS I THINK- THAT IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT. IS THE CAPITAL RAISING ARENA. AS A STATE. SO ONE OF THE CATEGORIES OF THIS OVERALL SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS. IS THE DEBT PUBLIC DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS SO THE GREEN BOND MARKETS IN THE SUSTAINABLE BOND MARKETS WHICH HAVE AN EQUAL- A GROWTH RATE AND TRAJECTORY THAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF MARKET APPETITE AND ENTHUSIASM. LAST YEAR WE HAD. ALL NEW RECORD VOLUMES OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND BILLION. IN THE GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE BONTA. AND THIS IS WHERE AND ISSUER IS SIX IN THE MARK. WHERE THEY ARE AGREE. THAT THE USE OF THAT INSURANCE WILL BE INVEST. IN GREEN OR SOCIAL ALKA. THAT IS- NOW A TEN YEAR LD MARKET. THAT IS- WHETHER YOU'RE A CORPORATE SOVEREIGN MUNICIPALITIES AND THEIR AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THIS MARKET IN ORDER TO RAISE CAPITAL FOR VERY DELIBERATE OUTCOMES. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY IS. ABSOLUTELY FOCUSED ON TRYING TO PUT MONEY TO WORK IN THE STRATEGIES EST STRATEGIES AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT COME TO MARKET IN THIS GREEN AND SUSTAINABILITY SPACE. ARE SEEING ENORMOUS TAKE UP FROM THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY- VIRTUALLY EVERY GREEN BOND THAT WE'RE BRINGING TO MARKET IS MULTIPLE TIMES OVER SUBSCRIBED AND WHAT THAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENS AS A BY PRODUCT OF THAT IN TERMS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND EQUATION. IS THAT WITH ALL THAT ENTHUSIASM FROM DESPERATELY NEEDS THAT DRIVE DOWN COST OF CAPITAL SO IT'S ALSO A VERY EFFICIENT PLACE TO RAISE CAPITAL TO INVEST IN THESE THESE OUTCOMES. AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS COAST COE THAT WERE DURING THIS YOU KNOW- CODE pYEAR. WE HAVE SEEN THE S. REALLY COME INTO THE FOR. THERE WAS NOT EVEN SUCH A THING AS THIS IS A SOCIAL BONDS TWO THREE YEARS AGO AND LAST YEAR THAT WAS ABOUT THE SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS PART OF THIS OVERALL SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION MARKET. SO BURSTING ONTO THE SCENE WITH THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY SAYING THEY REALLY WANT TO PUT CAPITAL TO WORK INTO TRYING TO SOLVE SOME OF THESE INEQUITIES THAT WERE SURFACED BY HOPE THAT. SO THAT'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE THE STATE LEGISLATURE. CAN THINK ABOUT NOT ONLY ADDRESSING CLIMATE AND HE IS. BUT ALSO THINKING ABOUT OF THOSE SO ISSUE THAT WERE ARE TO. JUST IN THE OPENING. SO LET COULD BE AN ISSUE ARE OF ITS OWN GREEN SOCIAL BY- THE OTHER THING. THAT THINK YOU CAN DO WITH. INTERNET IS TO KEEP NOT OR AND SEND. TO THE- COMMUNITY. WHICH WILL DRIVE HOW. IN THOSE DROUGHT AND THOSE OUT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I CAN POINT TO AND- THAT'S A HUGE SIX. IS TAX EQUITY IN. FIRST AND- THAT'S AB. YOU SUCCESS. OF WHERE ARE BIT OF POLICY NUDGING AND- CREATED A AN ENORMOUS INDUSTRY AND TODAY- I BELIEVE- MAYBE CALL IT NOTWITHSTANDING. THAT SOLAR INSTALLERS AS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS. ALL IN ALL INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN THE U. S. SO NOT JUST WORK. BUT EQUALLY SO DO SHALL WE SAY TAXES OR PENALTIES. SOMETHING LIKE A CARBON TAX WHERE THE PROCEEDS OF CARBON TAX ON HIGH CARBON EMITTING INDUSTRIES NOT ONLY CAN DRIVE MIGRATION TO PRINTER SOLUTIONS. BUT YOU CAN TAKE THE MONEY FROM THAT CARBON TAX AND INVESTED IN GREEN OR SOCIAL OUTCOMES SO THAT'S ANOTHER TYPE OF THING THAT YOU CAN DO I MEAN THEY'RE MANY OF THESE EXAMPLES AND HAPPY TO DESCRIBE THOSE IN MORE DETAIL. THE OTHER AREA THAT I WOULD JUST POINT TWO AND THEN I'LL STOP AND BE VERY HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. IT MAY BE CHALLENGING- THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERS. I CAN SEE- JUST IN THE SEVERAL YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN AT THIS WORK- ARE A REAL SEA CHANGE. IN THE MINDSET OF THOSE IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR. WE USED TO. HAVE A SEAT PEOPLE OPERATING IN DIFFERENT SILOS WHERE THEY SAID THIS AREA IS THE CURFEW OF GOVERNMENTS AND THIS AREA IS THE PURVIEW OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WHAT WE FOUND AND I THINK THE ONE THING DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THIS. BY SHOWING US WHAT THOSE WORLD BIG CHALLENGES ARE THROUGH THE U. N. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. IT ALLOWED THE SCIENTIFIC AND ACADEMIC COMMUNITY TO SIZE THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO SOLVE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST. CHALLENGES BY TWENTY THIRTY WHAT'S IT GOING TO COST. AND WHAT WE FOR. IS THAT AND COST THAT WOULD TO BE INVEST. IN THE SEVENTEEN GOALS WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER WE COPE AT. ABOUT THREE TO FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH GOVERNMENT MONEY FOR NON PROFIT MONEY THAT EXIST IN THE WORLD. TO FILL THAT GAP WE NEED THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO PARTICIPATE BUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO PART PARTICIPATING CAN'T DO WHEN IT'S ON IT'S ON IT NEEDS- A COMBINATION. OF ALL OF THOSE PLAYERS ON THAT FINANCIAL SPECTRUM FROM CIVIL SOCIETY TO GOVERNMENT PRIVATE SECTOR AND EVEN PHILANTHROPIST TO WORK TOGETHER. AND ANOTHER BURGEONING AREA OF THIS OVERALL SUSTAINABILITY IMPACT IELD IS WHAT IS. A TOPIC CALLED BLENDED FINANCE. AND THIS IS WHERE YOU BRING DIFFERENT ACTORS TOGETHER IN THE SAME PROJECT OR SAME HAPPENED STRUCTURE. IN ORDER TO BRING THE DIFFERENT EXPERTISE OF THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SIX TOGETHER TO HAVE A MULTIPLIER FACTOR IN THE OUTCOME. SO YOU MIGHT HAVE ANY GIVEN STRUCTURE A LAYER OF THE PROJECT THIS ISN'T GOING TO ACHIEVE. CUSTOMARY MARKET RATES OF RETURN SO YOU NEED CATALYTIC WORK GOVERNMENT CAPITAL WORK BABY PHILANTHROPIC CAPITAL. TO PARTICIPATE AND TAKE THE RISKIEST LAYER OF THAT STRUCTURE OFF THE TABLE TO THE IN CROWD IN. THE FOR PROFIT PRIVATE SECTOR TO ALLOW IT TO GENERATE ITS MARKET RATE OF RETURN AND THEN YOU CAN UNLOCK OFTEN SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS. AND WE'VE SEEN THIS CONCEPT OF BLENDED FINANCE ARE BEGIN TO EXPERIMENT IN NUMEROUS PROJECTS. ARE WHAT THEY BE ENVIRONMENTAL OR SOCIAL AND THEY'RE UNLOCKING PREVIOUSLY REALLY INTRACTABLE HURDLES THAT HAVE PROHIBITED THE PRIVATE SECTOR FROM PARTICIPATING. AND THAT'S AN IDEA OR NOTION WHERE THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE COMING TOGETHER CREATES YOU KNOW ONE PLUS ONE IS FAR MORE THAN TWO. SO I'M JUST GOING NOW THE NUMBER OF I. TO MAYBE LIGHT FAR. AND THAT PERHAPS I DONE LET JUST- TAKE A PAUSE AND- AND BEGIN TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I'M TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO LOOK AT YOU AND I'LL GIVE MY MICROPHONE IT'S- ONE OF THIS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF- OF DOING THIS REMOTELY- BUT- AND WEBER WERE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND JUST TO. MAKE SURE THE MEMBERS ARE AWARE- OF- THIS IS A OF REALLY VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ACTUALLY. HAVE A DISCUSSION. WITH SOME THE IS VERY KNOWLEDGE OF IN THIS FOR SO I. ALIVE AT THAT GOING JUST NOW WONDER TWO THAT YOU MAY BE CLARA. HOW QUICK SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A DIALOGUE- SO. WITH MS DREW HERE- AND I'D LEVEL WILL JUST SHARE WITH YOU A QUICK BACK AND- IN TALKING- HER- BEFORE THIS SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF WORKING WITH CREDIT SUISSE. SHE WAS APPROACHED TO TAKE ON THIS PROJECT FOR CREDIT SUISSE AND I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME SHARING THIS STORY BUT- THEY BASICALLY SAID TO HER. IF SHE HAD SHE SAID I'D BEEN THERE GRINDING AWAY AND DOING. VERY GOOD INVESTMENTS FR THE FOR THE BANK AND- THEY CAME AND SAID. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT YOUR LEGACY TO BE RIGHT YOU DID A GREAT JOB MAKING MONEY FOR THE BANK OR- YOU WANT SOMETHING ELSE AS YOUR LEGACY AND- SHE HAS JUMPED ON BOARD. FOR CREDIT SUISSE BUT I WOULD SAY SHE JUMPED ON BOARD FOR ALL OF US- IN TERMS OF REALLY TRYING TO- MAKE AN IMPACT AND THAT'S WHY SHE GENEROUSLY GIVING UP FOR TIME- IN THIS KIND OF SETTING SO WE HAVE A WE HAVE A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY. GEMINIDS TRY TO MAKE SURE WE GET THROUGH AS MANY QUESTIONS AS WE CAN AND SO I'LL TRY TO KEEP THIS MOVING EFFICIENTLY. I JUST HAVE A FEW THINGS I WANT TO CLARIFY ABOUT YOUR COMMENTS BEFORE I GET TO ANY OTHER PREPARED QUESTIONS YOU TALKED ABOUT- DISCLOSURE- DEBT SOON. IT'S BEEN VOLUNTARY BUT JUNE IS GOING TO BECOME REQUIRED- DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT WHETHER CALIFORNIA SHOULD TRY TO LEAD THE WAY IN TERMS OF. REQUIRING DISCLOSURE OR SHOULD WE WAIT FOR MORE COMMON DISCLOSURE- STANDARDS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED EITHER BY. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OR EVEN BY. OF SOME KIND OF GLOBAL STANDARD THAT IS OUT THERE DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ON THAT. I WOULD SAY IT IS FOR THOSE IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY- WHAT WE WANT IS. COMMON DISCLOSURE AND A COMMON SET OF STANDARDS I KNOW THIS IS THE HOLY GRAIL FOR US- AS A REGULATED ENTITY I CAN SPEAK ON CAMPUS WITH. A LOT OF PASSION ON THIS TOPIC BECAUSE- WHAT WOULD BE CHALLEGING FOR US IS IF WE FOUND- THANK YOU SAYING THERE'S ONE STANDARD THAT YOU MUST SUBSCRIBE TO IN TERMS OF MANDATORY DISCLOSURE. AND THEN WE FOUND- YEAH SINGAPORE SAYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THE BLESSING SOMETHING DIFFERENT AGAIN. I THINK THAT ALL THAT WOULD DO IS SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS AND CALL AND CAUSE CONFUSION. SO WHAT I WOULD RATHER SEE AS A HARMONY OF ADOPTION. OF BUT A MANDATORY- PUSH PUSH FOR MANDATORY DISCLOSURE AND JUST BECAUSE I DO SAY WITHOUT- REQUIRING IT. YOU KNOW YOU DO LEAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A FREE OPTION THERE'S ALWAYS THE FREE RIDER RHYS. AND I ALSO THINK WITHOUT MAKING IT MANDATORY THEN YOU AREN'T BEING PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT WHAT THOSE DISCLOSURES ARE AND THAT'S SO MUCH OF WHAT THE FINANCE COMMUNITIES ASKING FOR TO DRIVE AND SCALE MORE CAPITAL TO THE SPACE. SO AS AN EXAMPLE AND THE CORPORATE SPACE JUST TO MAYBE- MAKE IT TOO EASY TO BE A LOT EXAMPLE. IF AN INVESTOR TODAY SAYS I WOULD LIKE TO INVEST IN SUSTAINABLE LEADER AND ESG LEADER. AND THAT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THATTHESE LEADERS ARE GOING TO OUTPERFORM AND CREATE REAL VALUE. TODAY IN A GIVEN INDUSTRY IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT TWO COMPNIES SIDE BY SIDE IN TERMS OF THEIR SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES. YOU WILL FIND COMPLETELY DIFFERENT METRICS THAT THEY DISCLOSE BECAUSE IT'S VOLUNTARY SO I'M SLIGHTLY CYNICAL OFTEN PROBABLY BUCKET GIVEN MARKETS FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE BEEN. BUT I TEND TO SAKE PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THE THINGS THEY'RE GOOD AT AND PROBABLY NOT DISCLOSING THE THINGSARE NOT SO GOOD AT. AND THAT'S NOT HELPFUL FOR THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY SO THIS IS WHERE I THINK REGULATIONS VERY VERY IMPORTANT SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE BECAUSE TI CFG. IS REALLY TAKEN HOLD ON. NOW THERE ARE MORE THAN. TWO THOUSAND DIFFERENT ENTITY USE THAT ARE ADOPT T. C. MORE ABOUT HER AND SEVEN FIVE. TRILLION OF. A U. M. ASSETS UNDER. OF IN THE SERVICES IN. THEY'RE ADOPTING T. CFT CORPORATES ARE AND COUNTRIES. WE'VE SEEN EVEN THE DEVELOPING MARKETS YOU OFTEN WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE CONSIDERED TO BE SUSTAINABILITY LEADERS- THAT ARE THAT ARE FACING REAL CLIMATE ISSUES COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL. THEY'VE EVEN SAID THAT THEY WILL BE ADOPTING T. CFT SO I WOULD SAY TODAY. THE WORLD IS COALESCING AROUND THIS BEING ONE OF THE WAYS- THAT ONE CAN BE. DISCLOSING UNDER A CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK. THANK YOU SO. IN GENERAL I CERTAINLY. CAN APPRECIATE YOUR SUGGESTION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE COMMON STANDARDS I SHOULD ASSUME THAT MEANS COMMON DEFINITIONS ALSO. AND SO COULD YOU IF YOU KNOW NOW OR COULD YOU HELP US AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WITH WHERE DO WE GO TO MAKE SURE WE STAY AND SAYING WITH. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE COMMON STANDARDS POTENTIALLY HAVE INPUT IN THOSE COMMON STANDARDS. DO YOU HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR US- BRIEFLY AND IF WE MAY NEED MORE TIME OFFLINE AFTER THIS BUT- HOW DOES THIS CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IF WE'RE INTERESTED. STAY IN SYNC. WITH ALL OF THE OTHER EFFORTS THAT ARE OUT THERE. ABSOLUTELY SO- CERTAINLY THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY AND- THIS IS ALSO I'D SAY ENDEMIC TO BEING VERY VERY FST GROWING FIELD. IS THAT THERE ARE- THERE'S BEEN A PROLIFERATION OF THOSE TRYING TO CREATE STANDARDS OF THEIR OWN- I THINK THINK JOKINGLY SAY THERE'S A COTTAGE INDUSTRY IN THE STANDARDS SETTING AND THE ESG RATING SERVICES AND CONSULTANCY IRAQI SG. AND AND THAT THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE OF THE ORGANIC GROWTH BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE ALSO SEEING AS A CRY FOR CONSOLIDATION IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF HARMONIZATION IS HAPPENING. SO I WOULD SAY THE PREVAILING- STANDARDS THAT ARE EMERGING R. T. CFT SO I WOULD HIGHLYENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO GET FAMILIAR WITH THAT AND- ANTI CFT TASK FORCE WOULD BE I'M SURE THRILLED TO ENGAGE WITH YOU. AND SPEND TIME SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE A WORKSHOP. WITH IT WITH THE T. CFT WOULD BE I THINK HIGHLY BENEFICIAL FOR THOSE WILLING AND STARTED DOING A DEEPER DIVE. YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOOD PRACTICE LOOK LIKE IF COUNTRIES ARE DOING IT STATES CAN CERTAINLY DO IT RUN YOUR SCENARIO MODELING- AT WHERE YOUR EXPOSURES ARE IN JUST FORCING THE STATE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS BIGGEST RISKS- YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S MORE WILDFIRES ARE WATER SHORTAGE OR RISING SEA LEVELS AFFECTING PHYSICAL ASSETS. BUT ALSO WHERE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES WHERE CAN YOU TAKE THE THINGS THAT MAKE CALIFORNIA SO SPECIAL WHERE WHERE ARE YOUR MOST IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES- NOT ONLY LOOK AT IT WITH A RISK PLANS BUT AN OPPORTUNITY LET SO I THINK ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE SILICON VALLEY- AND THE YOU KNOW WONDERFUL TECH SECTOR THAT HAS BEEN SUCH A PART OF CALIFORNIA'S HERITAGE. AND SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE U. S. B. WELL WHAT ABOUT REALLY PUSHING AS AN OPPORTUNITY SET. SOMETHING LIKE THE GREEN TAX BASE IN A VERY FORCEFUL AND VERY VOCAL WAY- I CAN CERTAINLY SAY I'M AN OPPORTUNITY SIDE THE MOVING A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM DISCLOSURES BUT I'M SAYING IN TERMS OF THINGS WHERE YOU COULD JAM. SORT OF I LOOK AT. THE VARIOUS OTHER INITIATIVES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT'S. GOING TO BE UNIQUE TO YOU- YOU CAN YOU CAN-A LOOK AT- TO AND THEY- OPPORTUNITIES CAN. ALL SOME OF THESE. WERE CHALLENGES THAT BE ANOTHER PLAY WHERE I CAN THAT NON HEALTH COULD BE VERY INVESTED. BUT TO THIS CONCERT OF- THESE OTHERS. AND DAY SO YOU TO SEE. THE OTHER ONE THAT IS. BECOMING VERY IMPORTANT IS SAYS BECAUSE THE STAND OF ALL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD. THAT AGAIN IS A VOLUNTARY ORGANISATION MOSTLY DESIGNED FOR CORPORATES. AND IT'S AND IT'S EFFECTIVELY- GOES BY INDUSTRY. AND SAYS- FOR THOSE WHO JOIN SAYS B. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE MOST FINANCIALLY MATERIAL SUSTAINABILITY FACTORS FOR A GIVEN INDUSTRY. AND WE WOULD HOPE AND EXPECT THAT THE COMPANIES WOULD BEGIN TO DISCLOSE THOSE METRICS SO WE HAVE THAT COMMONALITY AND COMPARABILITY FOR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY. AND I THINK- FOR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THOSE MEANT METRICS ARE. FOR THE GIVEN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. THAT WILL POINT YOU TO THE PLACES WHERE DISCLOSURE MIGHT BE PROMOTED. WHAT ARE THE KEY LINE ITEMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE MOST CRITICAL FOR YOUR GIVEN KEY INDUSTRIES. THAT'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I THINK- YOU COULD EDUCATE YOURSELF ON. ON STANDARD SETTING- SO I YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY MORE THAT I COULD POINT TO I DON'T WANT TO HIJACK THE WHOLE CONVERSATION ON JUSTICE STANDARDS TOPIC SHOULD BUT- WHAT WE ARE SEEING FOR SURE. IS A HARMONIZATION CONSOLIDATION AND THERE WILL BE A MERGING LEADERS. AND I ALSO THINK THAT THERE WILL BE GLOBAL STANDARDS FOR WHAT IS MANDATORY AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO. TO FOLLOW ON RATHER. THAN TRY TO. REINVENT THE WHEEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M GOING TO NOW TURN OVER TO THE CHIU OF OUR- ASSEMBLY BY COMMITTEE MISS GRACE. FOR HIS QUESTIONS. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU MISTER FOR YOUR PRESENTATION VERY VERY INSIGHTFUL AND THAT EDUCATING AND I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION. THAT YOU SHARED- JUST HEARING YOUR LAST WORDS HERE- WAS WAS- IT COST POSITIVELY BECAUSE AYE AYE I WANNA KNOW. THE IMPORTANCE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND FROM YOUR LANDS- YOU SPOKE OF THE KIND OF THE COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT WHEN IT COMES TO FORMING STANDARDS AND- AND IT REALLY DOES MAKE A CASE FOR. A CENTRAL AGENCY TO GET INVOLVED TO CREATE THAT CONSISTENCY ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE TALKING- GLOBAL AND I THINK WE LOOK WE ARE IN THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW THAT EVERYTHING IS GLOBAL SO. HAVING SAID THAT WE CAN GOVERNMENT AT TIMES GET WAY AHEAD OF OUR SELF. AND SO WHAT I'M ASKING IS WHEN IT COMES TO DEFINITIONS AND FORMING THOSE CATEGORIES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT IN YOUR PRESENTATION. DO YOU SEE- BOB HAPPENING MORE EFFICIENTLY ON A LINEAR- SETTING OR OR PLATFORM OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE LIKE A BUFFET WHERE ALL THE IDEAS ARE OUT THERE. AND WE'RE JUST WE'RE WE'RE TAKING WHAT WE CAN GET AT THE TIME AND PUTTING TOGETHER THE PROGRAM HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE DEFINITIONS. AND THOSE CATEGORIES SET IN STONE FIRST BEFORE OTHER THINGS HAPPEN. IT'S A REALLY GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE IS A VERY VERY DYNAMIC SPACE AND YOU CAN SOMETHING AS WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF GREEN. THERE ARE SOME INDUSTRIES TODAY THAT DO NOT HAVE A GREEN PATHWAY TO NET ZERO OR PERSONAL LINES. AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO PROMOTE IT AND NOT VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OUR PATHWAYS WERE WERE TRANSITION. EXERCISE ON THE PORT OF CORPORATES IN THOSE INDUSTRIES TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S GREENER THAN WHAT THEY'RE DOING TODAY BUT WE MAY NOT HAVE THE GREENEST ANSWER BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE RELIANT ON TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WE DON'T WANT THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD SO I DO THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO GET STARTED ON THE JOURNEY. AND NOT WAIT TILL WE HAVE A PERFECTLY FORMED BEAST BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO PUSH. ALL OF US IN WHATEVER PART OF- THE EQUATION WE FIND OURSELVES AND WHETHER IT'S POLICY MAKING OR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY OR CORPORATE. I DO THINK WE WANT TO PROMOTE HARMONY. ACROSS WHEN WE DO SETTLE ON WHAT THESE DEFINITIONS ARE SO I WOULD SAY LET'S GO AND YOU SHOULD INTERPRET WHAT GREEN MEANS TO YOU IF THAT'S- AN AREA THAT YOU WANT TO BE FOCUSED IN OR SOCIAL. OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU AND THE WAY I INTERPRET THAT IN SEATTLE SERVICES I SAY IN THE ABSENCE. OF A GLOBAL DEFINITION FOR GREEN I HAVE TO SAY WHAT I THINK GREEN MEANS IN MY INVESTMENTS THAT I'M CREATING FOR MY CLIENTS AT THE VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT THAT IS AND WHAT IT'S NOT. AND THEN I ALLOW MY INVESTORS ARE MY CLIENTS TO PARTICIPATE WITH THAT FULL KNOWLEDGE AND THAT'S WOULD BE MY BEST ADVICE NOW IS TO GET GOING. PUSH YOURSELF TO IN THE DIRECTION OF WHERE YOU WERE. AND UP. AND THEN YOU KNOW I THE WORLD WILL COME. TO I KNOW THAT MANY- ARE SKEPTICAL. OF COMBINING THE GOAL OF MARKET RETURNS WITH- THE GOAL OF SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIAL CHANGE. IS THAT SKEPTICISM A REAL BARRIER OR- AND THEN ALSO WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THE OTHER CHALLENGES. THAT YOU SEE TOWARD MORE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF IMPACTING OR IMPACT VEST INVESTING. SURE SO- I WOULD SAY IF YOU HAD LOOKED BACK SEVERAL YEARS THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CYNICSM BECAUSE WE WERE ALL TAUGHT ANY OF US THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE- IN THE FINANCE WORLD SELF INCLUDED YOU KNOW IT IT WORKING WHEN I GOT MY MBA WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT. PURPOSE DRIVEN FINANCE OR VALUES ALIGNMENT WITH YOUR INVESTING OR COULD YOU ONLINE PURPOSE AND PROFIT FOR POSITIVE OUTCOMES THAT A RETURN. IT JUST WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS IN THE FRAME OF REFERENCE BUT NOW I THINK TODAY WHERE WE ARE IS THAT THERE THERE'S ENOUGH MATURITY IN THIS IMPACTS BASED ON THE BROADER SUSTAINABILITY FIELD THAT WE HAVE A REAL PROOF POINTS WE HAVE EXCELLENT DEMONSTRATION. OF WHERE WE HAVE CHEAT SHEET NOT ONLY MARKET RATES OF RETURN FOR VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES BUT-OUTPERFORMANCE BY COMBINING BY TAKING THAT YES SHE LANDS AND RUNNING ACROSS OUR INVESTMENTS OR INDEED GOING FRTHER AND SAYING I WANT TO ACHIEVE DELIVERED OUTCOMES. AND I THINK WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO CHEAT THESE POSITIVE OUTCOMES THAT YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT IMPACT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE. IT OFTEN LEADS YOU INTO INTERESTING PLACES THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE THOUGHT ABOUT- AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS AS AN INVESTOR AND I OFTEN SAY THE CYNICISM BEGINS WITH CAN YOU REALLY DO IT. I ALWAYS AND CHALLENGE PEOPLE TO SAY WELL I'M IN A POSITIVE PIECES THAT YOU CAN SO IF YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE CAPITAL AND LET ME GIVE IT A TRY AND I CAN PROVE TO YOU. THAT NOT ONLY CAN I GENERATE AT THE VERY MINIMUM MARKET RATE OF RETURN BUT I CAN ALSO HAVE. A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE WORLD. HOW CAN YOU KNOW LIKE THAT LET'S NOT TO LOVE. AND AT THAT SITTING GO THAT STEP. ONCE YOU PROVE IT TO THEM THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I FIND THOSE CYNICS BECOME YOUR GREATEST CONVERTS AND THEY BECOME AMBASSADORS FOR THE OVERALL SECTOR. BECAUSE THEY ARE SO THRILLED WITH THE FACT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO POSITIVE REVIEWS. WITH CAPITAL SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT TODAY WERE IN A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE MANY GROUP POINTS ACROSS ASSET CLASSES. WE ALSO HAVE A GREAT GROUP POINTS THROUGH THE CYCLE. WOULDN'T WE'VE HIT THE WORST OF THE WORST AND CO THAT BACK IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR WHEN THE MARKETS WERE JUST GETTING ABSOLUTELY HIT. THROUGH THE FEAR ENDS AND THE RESPONSE TO COALBED. WE SOLVED THIS IS SCALABLE STRATEGIES AND SO MANY IMPACT STRATEGIES OUTPERFORMED FAIRLY SUBSTANTIALLY MEETING PLACE. NOT JUST IN THE WORST OF THE CRISIS BUT THROUGH THE RECOVERY PERIOD AS WELL SO I THINK THERE'S AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RISK ADJUSTED RETURN RESILIENCY. YEAH WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IT'S NOT JUST HEALTH OUTPERFORMANCE IT'S ALSO RISK ADJUSTED RETURNS- RETURN MEDICATION. AND SO- AND THEN THE FINAL PIECE I WOULD POINT TO AS WELL AS IN ANY GOOD INVESTING STRATEGY. YOU WANT TO HAVE DIVERSIFICATION. AND OFTEN THINKING ABOUT IMPACT NEEDS YOU AS A STATE TO PLACES THAT YOU HADN'T THOUGHT OF BEFORE AND IN A GOOD PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION. YOU WANT TO HAVE A DIVERSE SET OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU'RE INVESTED IN. THIS IS A MERGING IMPACT SPACE. ISN'T SO CROWDED SO OFTEN TIMES THAT THE INVESTMENTS THAT YOU CAN GET INVOLVED IN. I DON'T HAVE HUGE BIDS FOR THEM THAT THE ASSETS AREN'T OVERPRICED SO THE OPPORTUNITY GREAT VALUE ALONG THE WAY AS AN INVESTOR IS VERY MUCH THERE WE CALL THAT THE- THE OUR TRANSITION IMPROVERS. NOT GENERATING THAT VALUE AS AS THEY'RE ON THAT TRANSITION JOURNEY. YOU ASKED ABOUT OTHER HURDLES- CLEARLY IN MY OPINION ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES IS THIS LACK OF A COMMON DEFINITION FOR WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE OR WHAT IS GREEN OR WHAT IS IMPACT. BUT AS I SAY THERE ARE MANY GREAT MINDS ARE AT WORK TRYING TO DEFINE THAT. AND. WE'LL GET THERE IN TIME AND AGAIN THAT'S- VERY MUCH THE SIDE OF A MATURE SPACE. HAVING BEEN IN THE FROM YEARS AS I WAS. EARLIEST ASSET CLASSES LARGE- ONE OF THE- TO UNLOCKING SCALE. WAS TO GET O COMMON. AND A COMMON ADAPTION OF. SHALL WE SAY WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE. IN A GIVEN SPACE BUT WE WILL GET THERE. I WOULD SAY THE FINAL SPACE- YOU KNOW WHERE WE SEE HURDLES- IS JUST- THE- THE ABILITY TO- DENTED TO MEASURE. THE OUTCOME SO SOMETIMES MEASUREMENT AS WELL AS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER SO IF YOU ARE MAKING AN IMPACT INVESTMENT IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE AN OUTCOME- YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE RIGOROUS ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE MEASURING. AND YOU ALSO NEED TO BE SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE BECAUSE SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS AS IN THIS DYNAMIC SPACE THAT WE'RE IN YOU LEARN AS YOU GO. SO WHAT IS THE BEST OUTCOME YOU MIGHT HAVE TO HIT IT OR TWEAK YOUR STRATEGY A LITTLE BIT TO ACTUALLY CHEAP HILLS MALCOLM THAT YOU NEED. SO ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE TO HOLD YOURSELF TO A VERY HIGH ACCOUNT AND WHAT YOU'RE MEASURING AND WHAT YOU'RE REPORTING ON. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOURSELF THE NEXT FOR A NETFLIX ABILITY TO TWEAK AND ADJUST YOUR BUSINESS PLAN BUSINESS MODEL TO PURSUE WHAT WORKS. AND SO I THINK THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT- WALKOM AS AS THE SPACE- CONTINUES TO MATURE AND MAINSTREAM. BUT TODAY THOSE ARE SOME OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS QUESTION SAID. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. AND SILVA MEMBERS. WE NORMALLY DON'T HAVE A DISCUSSION AT COMMITTEE HEARINGS- WE HAVE SORT OF FORMAL QUESTION TOOK CENTER- THIS IS DREW'S INVITED US TO HAVE A DISCUSSION AND TO THE EXTENT THAT- YOU'RE WILLING TO IT. I THINK IT COULD BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE- THIS THIS OF THIS- CALM KIND OF CONVERSATION WHICH WE WHAT DON'T DO VERY OFTEN. AND I SEE SENATOR MA'AM- IS READY T KICK OFF THE COULD THAT THE CONVERSATION SO- GO HEAD SENATE ARAMBULA. WELCOME AND- SENATOR ALLEN JOINED THIS YEAR NOW TO WELCOME. I THINK TEACHER BENNETT THANK YOU VERY SEN AND THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER I. GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR- PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S EXACTLY THE PRODUCTS WE NEED TO TAKE- I KIND OF WANT TO TAKE. IT TANGENTIAL QUESTION- THERE'S KIND OF A RELATED DEBATE I KNOW IN IN CAPITAL MARKETS THEORY. AROUND WHETHER OUR MARKETS ARE TOO SHORT TERM IN THEIR OUTLOOK. AND I'M WONDERING TO WHAT DEGREE THIS IS TIED TO THAT AND I GUESS WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS IN PARTICULAR. YOU KNOW I'M IMAGINING LIKE WE NEED A LOT OF MONEY. ONCE AND R. AND B. AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU MENTIONED GREENTECH AND I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT WE NEED. THAT CAPITAL GO THERE AND PRIVATE CAPITAL. COULD COULD REALLY FLOOD THE ZONE HERE. BUT THAT TYPE OF INVESTMENT HAS SUCH A LONG TERM OUTLOOK- AND WHEN I THINK OF U. S. CAPITAL MARKETS TODAY I THINK OF GAME STOP AND DOES KOREAN. YOU KNOW A VERY SHORT TERM IS. ALEX HAD HOW DO WE IN THE GOVERNMENT. ACTUALLY MOVE TO LONG TERM OUTLOOKS A AND ONE. WOULD AN EMPHASIS ON ON MAYBE. LONG TERM CASH- TAX POLICY OTHERWISE. AND PUNISHING SHORT TERM HORIZONS ALSO HAVE. POSITIVE IMPACTS ON ON GREEN INVESTMENTS ON ON THE TYPES OF PRIORITIES YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT AS WELL. YES YEAH WITHOUT QUESTION ON THIS IS WHERE I WAS GETTING A LITTLE BIT INTO THIS CONCEPT OF NATCHEZ- WHETHER IT'S POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE SO IT COULD BE NOT JUST A PENALTIES- SO I AGREE TYPICALLY WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE. DEEP IMPACT. IT IS A LONG TERM STRATEGY AND TYPICALLY NEEDS TO BE AN ILLIQUID STRATEGY. SO WHAT YOU SEE IS THE IMPACTS FACE BEING PREDOMINANTLY. IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY OR AND INDEED SOMETIMES VENTURE SPACE. AND THOSE BY DEFINITION TEND TO BE TENURE STRATEGIES- WITHOUT LIQUIDITY- SO YOU WANT THAT CAPITAL STAY IN THERE TO DRIVE THOSE OUTCOMES BUT IT'S NOT EXCLUSIVELY THAT. SO DRIVING OUTCOMES CAN COME IN DIFFERENT WAYS. AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS AS A BALANCE ACROSS THE SPECTRUM BACK TO MY PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO AS AN INVESTOR TO BE FALL INTO LIQUID PRIVATE EQUITY STRATEGIES AS MUCH AS THEY'RE NEEDED. AND THEY CAN GENERATE THOSE LONG TERM IMPORT RETURNS BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO AS POLICYMAKERS. I THINK YOU CAN THREE TAX YOU CAN INCENTIVIZE. LONG TERM HOLDS AND WE'VE DONE THAT ALREADY IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY INDUSTRY ALTHOUGH THAT MAY CHANGE. BUT WITH THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW HOW YOU TAX CARRIED INTEREST HOW YOU TAX PROBABLE THAT GOES INTO P. E. R. VENTURE. I THINK THAT'S ONE WAY ANOTHER WAY IS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS THE CAPITAL THAT GETS INVESTED IN THOSE ILLIQUID STRATEGIES- ONE OF THE NOTIONS THAT I AM. AS ALWAYS- SOMEWHAT BOTHERED ME A LITTLE BIT. IS THAT- WE- WE EQUATE ILLIQUIDITY ALWAYS WITH A LOT OF RISK. AND MOST OF OUR POLICY MAKING IN FINANCIAL SERVICES- DOESN'T ALLOW RETAIL INVESTOR THERE'S ALWAYS OFTENTIMES MOM AND- IN THE- TO GET A- IN PRIVATE. WE JUST THAT SEE YOU HAVE BE SET. TO BE THE LIQUID IN THE HOT INSTRUMENT. AND YET I SAY WE CAN ALLOW A MOM AND POP AN INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR TO BUY GAMESTOP OR TO BUY A SINGLE SHARE WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DO. AS MUCH AS IT CAN GO UP YOU CAN GO TO ZERO BUT IF WE LOOK OVER THIRTY YEAR HISTORY AND WE LOOK AT THE TOP TIER ONE PRIVATE EQUITY. FIRMS I CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE STRATEGY. OF A PRIVATE EQUITY FUND THAT HAS GONE BUST THEY MAY NOT HAVE MET THE 30% OR 25% RETURN HURDLES. BUT THAT THE NUMBER THAT HAVE GONE TO ZERO VIRTUALLY NOW SO I THINK EVEN IN THINGS LIKE WHAT IS APPROPRIATE IN A PENSION FUNDS. IF WE CAN CREATE INCENTIVES TO HAVE BALANCE BETWEEN ILLIQUID STRATEGIES AND LIKE WITH. AND THEN WE GIVE THE RETAIL INVESTOR THAT OPPORTUNITY TO HELP US DRIVERS LONG TERM OUTCOMES WHILE. GIVING THEM AN APPROPRIATE RISK ADJUSTED RETURN ACCESS TO THOSE WONDERFUL DOUBLE TO. THAT THEY MY NOT A GET THAT COULD BE PER. PLACE FOR TO DRIVE POSITIVE OUTCOMES. SO I DID ARE. THINGS THAT YOU COULD DO TO DRIVE THAT. YOU KNOW THE REVERSE IS TRUE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WAS SOME OF THE- NEW TAX POLICY THAT MAY COME OUT. OF THE TEN SHIRLEY CREATING HUGE INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO GO INTO ETFS- YES SO THIS SHORT TERM. LIQUID TRADED PASSIVE INSTRUMENTS SO YOU CAN SEE HOW VERY QUICKLY PROBABLY SEE ALL OF THAT TO BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT QUITE ACTIVELY IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS WITH SOME OF THE NEW POLICY. REGULATION AND MAYBE COMING OUT ON TAX- IN- IN THE BY THE MINISTRATION. VERY VERY QUICKLY CAP THROW WILL. IF YOU PROVIDE DIFFERENCE. SO THERE'S A TO DO IT WITH TAX AWAY THINK ABOUT IT IN. IN FUNDS OR OTHER FUNDING. THERE'S ANOTHER WAY YOU COULD DO IT- INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE DESPERATE TO MATCH FUND LONG TERM ASSETS AND LONG TERM LIABILITIES. IF YOU WENT TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND SAID LET ME GIVE YOU SOME POSITIVE INCENTIVES SOMEHOW FOR PROMOTING YOU TO DO MORE OF THIS TYPE OF IMPACT INVESTING IS FULLY ALIGNED PARTICULARLY ON CLIMATE. WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY'S. SUSTAINABLE HEALTH. RIGHT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE. UNDER OF BILL OF DOLLARS OF PAYOUTS CLIMATE RELATED WEATHER EVENTS AND WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO TAKE THAT NO THOSE THOSE- PREMIUM MONIES AND INVEST THEM RIGHT BEHIND THE VERY STRATEGIES THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE IN THAT WIN WIN FROM THEIR OWN BUSINESS MODEL. AND MAKING SURE THAT- THAT- YOU KNOW- ITS PAYOUTS TO BE LESS BECAUSE WE'RE SOLVING THE CLIMATE PROBLEM. SO I DO THINK THIS REQUIRES SOME DEEP THOUGHT BUT I THINK THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE FOR US TO RETHINK- SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM INCENTIVES. IF YOU COULD HAVE A QUICK FOLLOW UP YEAH I JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION ON YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ABOUT DIRECT INVESTMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT I MEAN. NOT IN IT REALLY IN THE RISKIER STUFF WHICH YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY. WE'VE BEEN LOATH AT THE GOVERNMENT INVEST IN EQUITY. YOU SEE A ROLE FOR DIRECT INVESTMENT FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS A SHOULD THAT SOLELY PRIVATE. CAPITAL IF WE LOOK AT THE GREEN NEW DEAL PERFECT EXAMPLE IN THE EO- I KNOW I SAID IN LONDON SO I'M VERY CLOSE TO A LOT OF THE EUROPEAN WORKS I DON'T MEAN THAT THEY ARE THE ALL AND ALL THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S VERY PROVOCATIVE PART OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS INCENTIVIZING ACTUAL CAPITAL INVESTMENTS- IN THE CITY'S GREEN OR AND ALSO SOCIAL. OUTCOMES THAT THEY ARE REALLY DRIVING IS VERY HEAVILY FOCUSED ON ON GREEN BUT SIDE COUPLE JUST TRANSITION SO THEY'RE NOT FORGETTING THE SOCIAL ASPECT OF IT AS WELL. BUT NONE OF THE TRILLION EUROS THAT WILL BE INVESTED IN THE GREEN DEAL WHICH IS PROMOTED BY. ESSENTIALLY AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL BODY- IS THERE BASICALLY THAT HAVE KEPT US SEVEN TO EIGHT SECTORS THAT THEY THINK ARE CRITICAL. TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND BEING VERY FIRST. OF BACKDOOR JEFF. OF WHAT WOULD BE AND- IN. BUT OF COURSE OF THAT WILL BE IN IN FACT. IN VENTURE. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE- THE SCIENCES AND ACADEMIC ACADEMIA WILL TELL US. ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED OUT OF THE TRILLIONS OF INVESTMENT. IS GOING TO NEED TO BE IN WHAT I CALL THE TRANSITION. AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENT SO THAT'S A VERY SIMPLE TWEAKING. BUT A THIRD OF IT IS GOING TO NEED TO COME FROM TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION SO IT'S GOING TO BE ADVANCES IN CARBON CAPTURE AND REEN HYDROGEN ALL OF THIS. THOSE ARE GOING TO BE IN MY OPINION LONG TERM YOU KNOW BERMAN S. VALUE CREATION OPPORTUNITIES. THANK YOU AND HAVE A BALANCED APPROACH A PORTFOLIOAPPROACH BUT IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN PROVIDE EITHER INCENTIVES FOR THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT THRIVE IT COULD BE TAX INCENTIVES AND THAT'S ANOTHER WAY FOR YOU TO INVEST. OR ACTUAL DIRECT INVESTMENTS MY BELIEF IS THE RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS COULD BE ENORMOUS FOR THE GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE IT ALMOST BY DEFINITION I GUESS THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS. IF YOU'RE SOLVING INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS. FIND ASSESS CITY- THOSE COMPANIES AND THOSE INDUSTRIES. IN THIS BUSINESSES WHICH CRACKED THAT. CODES SO TO SPEAK WE'RE GOING TO CREATE THAT IN IT OF THEM. ARE BE SUSTAIN THIRD THERE NEEDED. AND SO THIS IS WHY YOU SEEN. EACH VALUE CREATION AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND- NO TURNING TO FOOD AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS- SO I THINK THAT YET AGAIN I WOULDN'T PUT THE ENTIRE STATE PENSION FUND IN THERE BUT- I THINK IT REASONABLE. PORTION ALLOCATION INTO THIS SPACE I WOULD GENERATE GREAT RETURNS AND ALSO SEND ALL THE RIGHT SIGNALS. OTHER MEMBERS WITH THE QUESTION AND- I'LL USE THIS OPPORTUNITY- APPRECIATE THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THREE OF US WHO ARE GOING TO CALL IN FOR QUESTION IN JUST A SECOND BUT ALSO ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROB RIVAS JOIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY. AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE- WHO REINTRODUCED EARLIER- IS- IS NOW IN THE ASSEMBLY WITH TO SELL ASSEMBLYMEMBER. LUIS RIVAS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAND AT FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON- FOR ORGANIZING THIS HEARING SUCH AN INTERESTING TOPIC- AND SOMETHING I'M VERY INTERESTED IN SO THANK YOU- INTO THE SPEAKER THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY- SO I WAS READING. OF THE ARTICLE THAT WAS INCLUDED IN OUR PACKAGE FOR THIS HEARING ON THE WARNING THAT CORPORATIONS ARE GETTING ABOUT CREDIT RISK RIGHT FOR CAPITAL FOR CARBON INTENSIVE ACTIVITIES RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT'S BEEN A HOT TOPIC- RECENTLY I KNOW THERE'S A- FEDERAL PROPOSAL RIGHT TO- REQUIRE CORPORATIONS I THINK TO REALLY- DISCLOSE. AT LIKE SOME TYPE OF RISK ASSESSMENT RIGHT THAT THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND HERE IN OUR STATE- SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ALSO RIGHT NOW THERE SOBRE PROPOSAL'S GOING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. BOB AND SO MY QUESTION YOU KNOW THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THIS ARTICLE THAT SAYS THAT JUST THE MERE FACT THAT THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE LEARNING COMPANIES. THAT THERE IS A CREDIT RISK- IS THAT IT IS HAVING IMPACT AND SO I'M CURIOUS LIKE WHAT IMPACT IS THAT ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH YOU KNOW AND AS A STATE GOVERNMENT. WHAT CAN WE DO- TO ENCOURAGE THAT IN CALIFORNIA- I KNOW THAT. I HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORS BEING INVOLVED IN THIS- VERSUS A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION BUT IT'S KIND OF A MIX OF SINCE WE'RE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND FINANCIAL RISK OR CREDIT RISK IT'S KIND OF A MIX OF TWO AND I JUST DON'T KNOW. WHO IS THE MOST QUALIFIED WITHIN OUR OUR GOVERNMENT TO DO THAT SO JUST YOUR THOUGHTS ON ANY OF THAT HELPFUL OKAY- OKAY I'LL TRY TO OF COURSE THE FIRST. THAT UP A LITTLE BIT INTO YOUR QUESTION IS I CAN- MAYBE GIVE YOU AN OF OUR OWN INSTITUTE. SO JUST AS YOU WERE SAYING THIS THIS REQUIREMENTS INCREASINGLY WHICH IS TODAY- VOLUNTARY BUT WILL BECOME MANDATORY BUT THE REQUIREMENT EVEN WITH THE E. YOU. TO TAKE A TO SHOW THAT WE'VE TAKEN THIS INTO CONSIDERATION YES AND SHE AND THEN IN FACT THIS TASTY F. T. WHICH HAS FORCED US TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR EXPOSURES ARE LENDING EXPOSURES AS A BANK TO GREEN AND BROWN INDUSTRIES. AND THEN RUN SCENARIOS UNDER SAY A ONE AND A HALF OR TWO OR EVEN THAT LENDING BOOK LOOK LIKE HOW EXPOSED IS IT TOO SAFE PHYSICAL RISK- IF WE'RE HOLDING A BIG PORTFOLIO OF SAY COASTAL REAL ESTATE- IF WE HAVE A TWO OR THREE DEGREES- SCENARIO. AND WE HAVE THE SEA LEVEL RISES THAT SCIENTISTS ARE PREDICTING HOW MUCH OF THAT ASSET THAT WE HAVE ON OUR BOOKS IS GOING TO BE IMPAIRED. AND THAT'S THE MATH THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO RUN IN DEMONSTRATE UNDER G. CFT SO THE MERE FACT THAT THAT KNOWLEDGE WERE PUSH IS MAKING US DO THAT WORK. ALL OF A SUDDEN THEN WHAT DOES THAT DO THAT IS DRIVING THE BEHAVIOR CHANGE IN OUR INSTITUTION AS TO THINKING ABOUT. WHO WE WANT TO LEAD TO OR WHAT HI OF BUSINESSES AND WHAT. OF DO WE WANT TO LEARN TO SO IT CREDIT SUISSE HAVE CREE SOMETHING THAT WE ON C. E. DECLINE ENERGY TRENDS. FRAMEWORK AND WE WERE DOING IS WORSE. GOING EACH OF HIGH MANY IN THIS. TOP TO BOTTOM STAR WITH OIL AND GAS. AND WORKING ON WAY DOWN TO EVERYTHING FROM SHIPPING TO AVIATION AND WHATEVER. AND WE HAVE MAPPED ALL THE CLIENTS THAT WE BANKS AGAINST- THERE IS A HIGH CARBON INDUSTRIES AND WE'RE MAPPING THEM ON A CURVE- RANGING FROM COMPANIES TO WEEK WHO ARE UNAWARE. AND SIMPLY OUR INDICATING THAT THEY WANT TO THEIR- OR MIGHT BASS MODEL. ALL THE WAY THROUGH PROGRESS COMPANIES MAY BE IN THIS INDUSTRY WE SEEM REALLY MAKING CHANGE TO MIGRATE. TO SAY INVEST IN- BUSINESS MODEL CHANGE. AND IT WON'T BE A SURPRISE TO ANY OF YOU THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS AT AND SO MAPPING THOSE THOSE COMPANIES ALONG THAT SPECTRUM- WE SAID TO OURSELVES THAT WE'RE GOING TO ULTIMATELY. HAVE A SUNSET PROVISION. ON THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLIENTS WHO DON'T DEMONSTRATE AN AWARENESS TO CHANGE AND A DESIRE TO CHANGE BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THOSE ASSETS ARE THOSE COMPANIES THOSE EXPOSURES ALTERNATELY BECOME IMPAIRED CREDITS. IN IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE SO BASICALLY THE BEHAVIOR CHANGES THAT WE'RE NOW MIGRATING. WHO WE WANT TO THANK IN FUTURE AND THAT'S THE COMPANIES THAT I DON'T WANT TO TRANSITION OR THAT ARE ALREADY- IN THAT- THAT GREEN SPACE SHALL WE SAY. SO THIS IS SORT OF A LONG WINDED ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION BUT I THINK THAT MAYBE THAT ILLUSTRATION GIVES YOU A SENSE OF JUST HOW SERIOUS THIS IS. SO THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF IT. ANOTHER ASPECT OF IT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS THE FIRST YOU OF LEGISLATURE OR JUST LET MARKET FORCES AT WORK. I CAN CERTAINLY TELL YOU THAT THE DRUMBEATS OF THE CLIMATE ACTIVISTS ARE LOUDER AND LOUDER. AND THAT'S MANIFESTING ITSELF IN INSTITUTIONAL AND- EIGHT. GOING INTO CORPORATES AND SAYING IT'S ALL THIS DIVEST CAMPAIGN TYPE WORK THAT SAY. THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED THAT YOU'RE ON A PATH TO NET ZERO PARIS ALIGNMENT WE CAN NO LONGER HOLD YOUR STOCK. AND WHEN COALITIONS OF INVESTORS GO INTO A CORPORATE AND WE'RE TALKING ON THE LARGE CAP CORPORATES WE'RE SEEING COALITIONS FORM OF. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SHAREHOLDER CAPITAL DEMANDED IN THE CLOCK COMPANIES RESPOND TO THAT OR THEY WILL DIVEST IT'S A VERY POWERFUL MOTIVATOR. SO I THINK THERE IS AN ELEMENT THAT THAT THIS IS ALMOST TAKING CARE OF ITSELF. BUT WHERE I. THINK POLICY COULD EXCEL THE RATE THAT IS WHAT IF HAD- CAPITAL GAINS AND- FOR A- IN GREEN. FOR CAPITAL HITS IF YOU WILL. FOR CONTINUING TO. LAND TO BROWN SO FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN ONE OF OUR BIGGEST ISSUES IS WE HAVE TO SET ASIDE CAPITAL OR RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS AGAINST THE RISKIER ASSETS. WELL IF RISK ISN'T BEGINNING TO INCREASINGLY BE DEFINED AS- CLIMATE RELATED RISKS RIGHT- OR THE RISK OF STRANDED ASSETS- ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY EXPENSIVE. FOR US TO CONTINUE TO LAND BROWN INDUSTRIES WE WON'T DO IT ANYMORE. AND THEN THOSE COMPANIES WILL BE STARVED OF CAPITAL IN WHICH CASE THEY'LL EITHER HAVE TO MIGRATE AND TRANSITION. OR THEY WON'T SURVIVE AND SO I THINK POLICY COULD ACTUALLY ACCELERATE THAT CHANGE YOU KNOW IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ON THE AGENDA. SO THAT THAT COULD BE A VERY POWERFUL TOOL IN CONJUNCTION. WITH THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CLIMATE SCIENTIST. AT TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK YOU NEED DEEP EXPERTISE IN CLIMATE SCIENTISTS YOU CAN SAY WHAT ARE NOT JUSTIFIED REALLY SEE FUNDAMENTALLY I WANT TO DRIVE. GREEN INVESTMENT THEY'RE VERY EASY WAYS TO DO THAT WITH WITH POLICY ON TOP OF WHAT THE ACTUAL SERVICES. WOULD OTHERWISE ORDINARY. I DON'T I DON'T KNOW BUT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION TO HOLD TOUCHED ALL THE- OF. IT IT GETS ME TO TAKE TO JUST TO FOLLOW UP THAT WAS WHEN YOU SAID POLICY OULD. ENCOURAGE WHAT SPECIFIC KIND OF POLICY COULD THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DUE TO ENCOURAGE THAT. AND I'M I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHERE I HEAR BETTER SO YOU'LL SEE ME MOVING BACK AND FORTH AND I'LL JUST ADD ON TO HIS GOOD QUESTION AND A LETTER ANSWER BUT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. JUST OR EVEN OUR OWN ASSET LARGE ASSET OWNERS YOU KNOW WE HAVE YOU KNOW CALPERS AND CAL STIRS WHICH ARE OUR OWN THAT'S PENSION FUNDS YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW. WHAT CAN WE DO TO BETTER ENCOURAGE THEM TO. THINK YEAH YEAH- JUST JUST THERE AND PENSION FUNDS- YOU KNOW. SOMETHING THAT HAS OCCURRED NOT. YET RECENTLY RECENTLY AND- MOST PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE IT'S CONSIDERED PART OF YOUR FIDUCIARY DUTY TO- TAKE THIS ESG AND CONSIDERATION AS A PENSION FUND TRUSTEE. SO BY MAKING IT PART OF YOUR FIDUCIARY DUTY WHAT DO YOU DO EVERY PENSION FUND TRUSTEE NOW IS SAYING I'M GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT MY PENSION FUNDS CALPERS CASTERS EVERYBODY ELSE AND SAYING. I HAVE TO LOOK AT ESG OR ELSE I'M NOT DOING MY DUTY- AS A AS A- PENSION FUNDS YOU KNOW ASSET. MANAGER AND OWNER- SO YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN REINFORCE THOSE NOTIONS THAT IT'S JUST GOOD HYGIENE OR GOOD PRACTICE AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN AGAIN YOU'RE YOU'RE PUSHING THAT AGENDA SO YOU CAN DO IT. THROUGH SUBTLE NUDGES AS I SAY YOU CAN DO IT THREE TAX YOU CAN DO IT THROUGH- PENALTIES- THAT THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE SO MANY TOOLS I THINK YOU HAVE AT YOUR DISPOSAL BUT THAT'S THE OBVIOUS ONES ARE AS I SAY NOT AS OR OR PENALTIES- BUT- I. I TEND TO BE A BIG FAN OF DRIVING BEHAVIOR CHANGE THROUGH INCENTIVES RATHER THAN DISINCENTIVES- I FIND DISINCENTIVES ALWAYS HAVE SUCH A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION THAT I THINK ARE VERY UNPOPULAR WITH LARGE SWATHS OF THE POPULATION BECAUSE IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE YOU'RE GIVING SOMETHING UP. ASSEMBLY CAN REDIRECT- MORE TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT'S AN INSIDE I THINK IT'S IT TENDS TO BE BETTER ABLE TO BE DIGESTED BY FIRE CONSTITUENCIES. AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO TELL THE OPPORTUNITY THE STORY- TO. THAT IS SO MUCH A PART OF COURSE. BECAUSE IN THE GAME WINNERS LOSERS. JUST IN THE SHOW OF HI. EMITTING INDUSTRIES TO GREENER ENERGY THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN THE HIGH CARBON EMITTING INDUSTRIES THAT COULD PERCEIVE THIS. AS A BIG LOSS AND SO THEY MAY WANT TO FIGHT THAT CHANGE. ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE ARE AT THAT- AND SOMEBODY REFERENCED AT THE KODAK MOMENTS- WHETHER YOU FACE DISRUPTION IF YOU DON'T CHANGE. WHAT WE WOULD RATHER DO IS PREPARE THOSE INDUSTRIES ARE ULTIMATELY GOING TO FACE- THE- MASSIVE VALUE LOSS. TO TRY TO TRANSITION PEOPLE SOONER SO IT DOESN'T COME AS A SHOCKER WE DON'T HAVE STRANDED ASSETS OR WASTED- YOU KNOW- HOPE COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN REALLY PUSH TO TRY TO QUICKLY ADAPT TO ME IT'S ALL ABOUT THIS THIS CLIMATE ADAPTATION CLIMATE ADAPTATION IS SEIZING THE MOMENT OF THE OPPORTUNITY- SO ANOTHER AREA BY THE WAY THAT WE DIDN'T TOUCH ON IS I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE STATE. GETS INVOLVED IN ANY TYPE OF SUBSIDIES. BUT SUBSIDIES ARE A POWERFUL INCENTIVE ALSO TO DRIVE CHANGE WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER ABOUT TAX. BUT YOU KNOW IF WE EVEN READ DIRECT SUBSIDIES AS THE BY THE STRANGE SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT- TOWARDS SAY THAT- FOSSIL FUELS INDUSTRY. AND PUSH THOSE TOWARD GREEN. YOU NEED TO SEE AGAIN HOW QUICKLY THE CAPITAL FLOW TO THOSE AREAS BECAUSE IT WILL BE MORE ATTRACTIVE PLACES TO INVEST. AND THE VALUE CREATION OPPORTUNITIES THERE AN EQUAL DOWNSIDE SIDE IS THAT IF YOU'RE CONTINUING TO SAY INVEST IN COMPANIES THAT WILL NO LONGER BE RECIPIENTS OF SUBSIDIES. ARE THOSE BUSINESSES STILL EVEN VIABLE WITHOUT SUBSIDY. OR WILL THE VALUE LAST BE SO GREAT THAT YOU DON'T WANNA HOLD THOSE ASSETS SO I THINK THAT AGAIN THOSE ARE JUST A FEW SNIPPETS OF IDEAS THAT YOU COULD DO- TO- TO PROMOTE ALL OF THIS. I THINK THE OTHER AREA BY THE WAY WHICH DOESN'T EVEN REQUIRE ONE POLICY INTERVENTION IS JUST BE VOCAL. ABOUT. THE FACT THAT- CALIFORNIA ENCOURAGE AGES. A SUSTAINABLE. OR IS X. ABOUT CREATE CALL SUPPORTING ALL INDUSTRIES- THAT. TO WITH US USING THE- AROUND. OR SOCIAL. SO EVEN SOMETIMES JUST BEING VERY CLEAR DIRECTIONALLY. ABOUT WHERE THE STATE IS ON THESE TOPICS IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE WHEN INVESTORS GET CONFUSED MESSAGES THAN THEY DO WORRY ABOUT- POLICY INTERVENTION KIND OF- SOMEHOW. CLEAR DURING THEIR THEIR INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND THAT'S COMING AS A SHOCK TO THEM SO THEY WERE BEING VERY VERY- CHRIS. AND THE DESIRE TO TRY TO PUSH IN A GIVEN DIRECTION THE EXTENT THAT YOU POSSIBLY CAN- IS ANOTHER WAY TO GIVE CONFIDENCE TO THE MARKETS TO INVEST BEHIND THEM. ANYTHING ELSE LOOSE THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN. WHAT WELL FIRST OFF THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS FOR PUTTING TOGETHER A REALLY FASCINATING DISCUSSION THANK YOU MISTER- APPRECIATE ALL YOUR- KNOWLEDGE AND- INTERPRETERS AVACEN HERE TODAY. YEAH I GOT SO MANY QUESTIONS I AM. YOU'RE THE STATE CALIFORNIA WE DID PASS A BILL THAT- NASSER CAL STIRS CALPERS TO LOOK IT. AT AT AT AT RISK AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT IS THERE CLIMATE RELATED RISK BECAUSE THEY'RE MAKING THEIR-INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND HE'S BEEN A BIT OF IT. BACK AND FORTH- OVER THERE AND- THAT THAT THAT THERE'S SOME TENSIONS INTERESTINGLY- BETWEEN THEIR BOARD AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL. BUT I'M- YOU KNOW I'M THINGS FIRST OF ALL DELIVER THOUGHTS ON THE WHOLE DIVEST MEANT DEBATE- I'M IN THE BACK AND FORTH- YOU KNOW ON THAT- THE EXTENT TO WHICH- YOU KNOW IF YOU DIVEST YOU'RE- YOU'RE PULLING YOURSELF. OBVIOUSLY YOU YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR MONEY GOING INTO. IMAGINED AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY DAMAGING ACTIVITY AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DIVEST. ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS AS YOU PULL YOURSELF OUT OF THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. TRANSITIONING THESE COMPANIES TOWARD A MORE SUSTAINABLE MODEL- SO LET LET LET'S START WITH THAT LOVE TO HEAR YOUR CONVERSATION YOU'RE YOU'RE THOUGHT. OF US IN THE SHORT. SO I'M SPEAKING AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT I ALSO THINK PHILOSOPHICALLY I. DO REPRESENT- OUR OUR BELIEF IT AT CREDIT SUISSE AS WELL IS THAT- THE VESTMENT HAS A CERTAIN PLACE. IN ALL OF THIS BUT FRANKLY I THINK THE MORE IMPORTANT TOOL THAT WE THINK OF AS AS A BANK IS WE WOULD MUCH RATHER FINANCE THE TRANSITION. WE THINK THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET TO NEXT YEAR WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO KEEP WITHIN- PARIS GOALS IF WE DON'T GET THE HIGH CARBON EMITTING INDUSTRIES TO MOVE. AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS OVERNIGHT TO THE QUESTION OF THIS IS A LONGER TERM INVESTMENT- VERSES OR SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE SHORT TERM. BUT WE DO NEED TO BE A PART OF FINANCING THAT SO I THINK WHAT I SAY AS WE KNOW TODAY THE WORLD WAS RELIANT ON FOSSIL FUELS WE SAID WE'RE GOING TO DIVEST AND JUST CUT IT OFF TOMORROW. WE WOULD CUT OFF EVERYBODY FROM THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF HEAT AND ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY AND WE WOULD ALSO CREATE A HIGHLY UNJUST OUTCOME BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THESE TYPES OF ACTIONS DISPROPORTIONATELY ALWAYS AFFECT THOSE AT THE LOWER ECONOMIC STRATA. BECAUSE THEY TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE ALTERNATIVES SO WE CAN'T DO THAT WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS IN A IN A THOUGHTFUL AND STANDS- MASATAKA WAY. SO WHAT I WOULD. BUT SAY. IS IF WE DO. HAVE H. GREEN. ALTERNATIVE RIGHT A OPPORTUNITY AT PATHWAY THAT'S TRULY GREED THERE I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO DRIVE WITH AS MUCH CARE AS THE STACK BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A SOLUTION THAT IS TRULY VIABLE WE GOT TO MOVE TO THAT WE HAVE TO MOVE FAST THERE'S AN URGENCY HERE. BUT IN AREAS WHERE- YOU HAVE A VAST MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION THAT IS RELIANCE ON THAT SOURCE OF ENERGY AS AN EXAMPLE THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE ALONG THE JOURNEY AND THAT'S NOT ONLY JUST IN TERMS OF THE COMPANY'S MINORING IN BUSINESS PLANS IN OUR OWN RIGHT BUT IT'S ALSO MAKING SURE WE DON'T LEAVE PEOPLE BEHIND SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH BUT YOU'RE IS LIKE COAL WHICH GENUINELY TODAY- DO NOT HAVE A PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY THEY'RE SO DESTRUCTIVE YOU HAVE BETTER CHEAPER ALTERNATIVES. WE REALLY OUT OF PUSH FOR NO MORE BUT PLACES LIKE FOSSIL FUELS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THIS MIGRATION BUT WE NEED TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION WE'D RATHER DO IS FUN WITH THESE COMPANIES INTO BOTH INVESTING IN THEIR BUSINESS BY MIGRATION BUT ALSO INVESTING IN THE TECHNOLOGIES IT'LL PROVIDE PATHWAYS SOMETIMES TODAY DON'T EVEN EXIST YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY INDUSTRIES AND HIGH CARBON IN SPACE WHERE YOU ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE TO AGREE AN ALTERNATE YEAH. WE DON'T HAVE A TRULY GREEN ALTERNATIVE FOR AVIATION FUEL TODAY ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME PROMISING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE WORKS SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH IS MY ULTIMATE ANSWER BUT I DON'T THINK THAT DIVESTMENT ALONE IS GOING TO CHEAT THE OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT TO GET COULD BE CATASTROPHICALLY DETRIMENTAL TO SOCIETY IN THE MEANTIME IF WE ALL SET. TURN OFF THE TAPS TOMORROW. WELL THE PROBLEM IT THE- NEED SOME RESPECTS. OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE. WERE TO OFF THE TOP TOMORROW. BUT THE TRUTH AS WE ALL KNOW. IS ONE. OF THE- CAPITAL MARKETS THAT WOULD TURN OFF THE TAPS AND IN FACT YOU HAVE A ONE YOU HAVE OTHER. PORTIONS OF. INVESTOR COMMUNITY THAT MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF THE FACT THAT. SO MANY PEOPLE ARE PULLING OUT AND YET THERE IS THIS THIS RELIANCE IN THE COURSE OF THE FOLKS ARE MAKING MONEY OFTENTIMES- YOU KNOW THE BILL THE LEAST- SOCIALLY INCLINED- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF FOLKS THAT ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY DOING MORE RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENTS TO SELL OUT YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DIFFERS FROM THIS IN THE KODAK MOMENT IS THAT THE CODE ACT FOLKS. I'M YOU WERE UNABLE TO RESPOND TO. ADD TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET. AND THAT WERE LUCKY OF THEIR WORK THEY WERE TECHNOLOGICAL AND- CONSUMER BASED IN NATURE. OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS. IS A IS A MASSIVE GLOBAL POLICY. AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS. AND THE FACT THAT WHILE WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO ACT THIS IS AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS FOR. MANKIND FOR OUR PLANET- YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THERE WILL THERE ARE IN THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE- NOT DENIERS AND FREELOADERS. WHO ARE GONNA CONTINUE TO DOUBLE DOWN AND MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN- AND- SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT DYNAMIC AS WELL I MEAN EVERYTHING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A PRE SUPPOSES THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET TOGETHER AND DO THE RIGHT THING. YEAH WE'RE SO DIVIDED NOT ONLY AS A GLOW BUT AS A NATION YOU HAD A YOU KNOW FORMER PRESIDENT HE WOULD LEARNING AROUND KHAN THE WHOLE THING A HOAX. I'M SO. IT'S IT IT IT DOES FEEL DIFFERENT THAN KODAK FOR THAT REASON AND I'D LOVE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. YES I MEAN I THINK. IF YOU KNOW IF I REMEMBER MY CASE STUDY CORRECTLY THOUGH KODAK DID HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR DIGITAL FILM THEY JUST NEVER SAW IT COMING BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE APERTURE OF THE LENS TO SUGGESTED THAT BUSINESS MODEL LIKE IT DISRUPTED OUT EXISTENCE IF THEY DIDN'T SEIZE THAT MOMENT BUT- PUTTING THAT ASIDE YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS ABSOLUTELY VALID POINTS. THAT THERE WILL BE PEOPLE THAT WILL OFFER ARBITRAGE THE SYSTEM SO IF CORPORATES ARE STARVED OF CHEAPER LENDING CAPITAL THERE WILL BE THOSE THAT WILL COME IN AS THE LENDER OF LAST RESORT. RESORT IN CHARGE USURIOUS RATES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE LENDER OF LAST RESORT ARE THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN. HOWEVER FOR THOSE COMPANIES AND TRYING TO ACCESS THAT CAPITAL THAT'S GOING TO GET INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT AND IT'LL BE EXPENSIVE. SO IT'S GOING TO REALLY HIT THEIR BOTTOM LINE SO IT IS A POWERFUL TOOL TO USE YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. AS AS SHALL WE SAY AN INCENTIVE- TO MY GREATER CHANGE AND WE CAN ALSO SEE IT AND THAT'S JUST NOT DATA RUNNING BATTLE. THE PRESSURE IS ON THE EQUITY SIDE TO- CERTAINLY I'M SURE YOU'RE WELL AWARE JUST SUGGESTING. OF THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT OF EQUITY VALUES THAT YOU KNOW EXXON'S LOST OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS COMING OUT OF HERE THE FORTUNE FIFTY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NINETEEN THIRTIES- AND IT'S HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF CAPITAL- PARTLY BECAUSE I THINK THE- EQUITY COMMUNITY. DIDN'T SEE A CLEAR ENOUGH WILLINGNESS OR CLIMATE PLAN THAT WAS ARTICULATED TO SAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE ON THE PROGRAM TO TRANSITION. AND SO INVESTORS EVEN IN THE FOSSIL FUELS INDUSTRY SAID. I'M GOING TO MIGRATE THAT CAPITAL TO THOSE WHO CAN ARTICULATE A BETTER STORY WHICH I THINK IS GOING TO BE LONGER TERM SUSTAINABLE. AND I DON'T WANT TO HOLD THE EQUITY OF PERHAPS YOU KNOW COMPANIES THAT DON'T ALIGN YOU KNOW WITH MY CHRONICLES SO WHILE I DO THINK THERE IS A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE THOSE ONE ARBITRATION SYSTEM CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE THEY CAN CHARGE YOU KNOW. THERE'S USERS RATES AT SOME I'M POINT THEY WERE LEFT THEY'LL BE HOLDING EMPTY BAG WENT AWAY REALLY DOES. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S HARD TO ENVISION A WORLD. WHERE YOU IF YOU HAVE EVERY. CRUNCH IN THE WORLD- ECONOMY IN THE WORLD SAYING THAT THEY'RE COMMITTING TO THAT ZERO- CHINA INCLUDED SOME OF THOSE WHO HAVE WORKED SOME OF THE BIGGEST. NEWEST CARMEN BETTORS ARE SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO GET THERE AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS WITHOUT IT'S COMPLICATIONS AND THERE'S A LOT THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK THROUGH IN TERMS OF GETTING THINGS LIKE A LONG CALL POLICY. BUT THEY MADE A PUBLIC COMMITMENT TO GET THERE. AS WE LEAD UP TO COST VIRTUALLY. EVERY MAJOR NAME. LEAST ONE VERY. IS NOW COMMITTING TO NET ZERO AND I GENUINELY THINK THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY WILL HOLD THEM TO ACCOUNT TO THEIR STATEMENTS. I THINK INCREASINGLY REGULATORS ARE ALSO GONNA HOLD THEM TO ACCOUNT. I E. EMPTY PROMISES WITHOUT ACTUAL ACTION. IS NOT GONNA BE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO TOLERATE IT OVER TIME. SO THAT GLOBAL MOVEMENT THAT'S WHERE THE WORLD'S GOING THAT'S WHERE THE CAPITAL IS GOING TO BE INVESTED THAT'S WHERE THE CONSUMERS WANT TO SEE THE OUTCOMES THAT'S WHERE REGULARS EVERYONE ELSE WE WANT TO GET COMES AND IT'S JUST IT'S EXISTENTIALISTS. I DO THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE A SUNSET PROVISION ON THOSE WHO WANT TO SAY LET ME JUST SORT OF SHALL WE SAY RIDE THIS AND SALES YOU KNOW THE PARTIES OVER. WHAT WHAT TOOL DO I REGULAR HAVE O HOLD THE BIRDS. OR FOR EXAMPLE AND COMPANIES IN THOSE COUNTRIES ACCOUNTABLE TO THESE. THESE GOALS AND PROMISES. I DON'T THINK- AND I'M NOT EIGHT GLOBAL ECONOMIST OR STRATEGIST I DON'T I THINK IT'S VERY HARD FOR A COUNTRY WHO IS ON THE PATH TO HOLD ANOTHER COUNTRY TO ACCOUNT- HOWEVER. YOU KNOW THERE IS- I'D SAY YOU KNOW GLOBAL PEER PRESSURE TOO LATE TO GET THEIR NEXT YEAR LOOK AT THE COMMITMENTS ARE HAPPENING JUST JUST WATCH AS WE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO COUGH AND SEE HOW MANY MORE COUNTRIES YOU KNOW JUMP ON. EVEN MORE- ED SAFE RESTIVE COMMITMENTS TO GET TO THAT ZERO I THINK THERE IS THIS GLOBAL PRESSURE OF COUNTRIES TO GO THERE. BUT I ALSO THINK IF THE COUNTRY LEADERS DON'T ARTICULATE THAT THEY'LL BE A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER INCENTIVES OR DISINCENTIVES TO THOSE COUNTRIES ON THE ONE HAND THE COUNTRY THAT COMPANIES WITHIN THOSE COUNTRIES- YOU KNOW I THINK INCREASINGLY CAPITAL WILL FLOW THERE IF THE COMPANIES AREN'T. TAKING MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN ACCOUNT BUT I ALSO THINK CITIZENS ARE GOING TO ULTIMATELY SAY NO MORE- THERE ARE MODELS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN COUNTRIES WHERE YOU'VE GOT LEADERS WHO ARE SHOWING. REAL PROGRESSION IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABILITY AND THEY TEND TO BE THE COUNTRY'S WHOSE- POLITICAL LEADERS ARE INCREASINGLY CAPTURING THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS. AND AS CLIMATE CHANGE BEGETS MORE AND MORE AND MORE REAL FOR PEOPLE THAT THE TOLERANCE LEVEL OF LIVING IN A SOCIETY WITH HIGH POLLUTION THIS IS PARTLY WHY I THINK YOU KNOW CHINESE RESPOND AS THE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP AND BARELY BE ABLE TO READ THE ERROR OR HAVE YOU KNOW YELLOW REVERSE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE AS A POLITICAL LEADER SO I ALSO THINK IN SITUATIONS ARE GOING TO DEMAND THAT OF THE READERS BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE. YEAH THAT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN REACH INTO ANOTHER COUNTRY OTHER THAN THROUGH PERSECUTION TO SAY YOU MUST DO THIS. BUT I THINK. THE FORCES AT WORK WILL GET US THERE ANYMORE. HI MISTER I PLEDGE WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR EARLY. COMMENTS ON- THE FIDUCIARY DUTY ELEMENT WHICH IS SOMETHING I'VE NOT HEARD OF. ANY EEN THE WHAT THE FIDUCIARY. DUTY FOR ESP ACTORS AND YOU- I'M JUST BECAUSE I KNOW VERY ABOUT. THE E. U.'S CORPORATE LAW- BUT- YOU KNOW IT'S I WHAT ARE THE IN. MECHANISMS FOR THAT IS A TYPICALLY RIGHT. IS IT PRIVATE LAWSUIT TO THE THEY HAVE A THAT FOR RULE THERE- SORT OF HOW DOES THAT PRETTY SURE YOU DO. IN JUST KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A NOT YOU SAID TO ENCOURAGE DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS WHO ALREADY WANT TO. INVEST IN CONSIDER THESE FACTORS INTO DOING THE RIGHT THING. YES THERE'S DIFFERENT THERE ARE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THIS- MANIFESTING IN DIFFERENT PLACES BUT THE SUSTAINABLE FINANCE DIRECTIVES S. SEVENTY ARE WHICH IT WAS WHAT I WAS REFERENCING EARLIER THAT CAME INTO PLACE IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR. IS A PIECE OF REGULATION THAT'S GOVERNED BY THE E. U. FOR ANY BANKS OR ASSET MANAGERS WHICH OPERATED IN THE U. E. L. THAT YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THROUGH- DISCLOSURE THAT YOU'RE TAKING AND MAKE A COMMITMENT OR A STATEMENT. A TESTAMENT THAT YOU ARE TAKING THESE INTO CONSIDERATION SO THEY'RE USING THAT AS A TOOL- BY VIRTUE OF THEIR REGULATORY POWERS OVER BANKS AND ASSET MANAGERS. ON THE ONE HAND AND THEN THE COMMON ABOUT THE JUDICIARY DUTY SO THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES SO ONE IS YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU'RE TAKING ESG INTO ACCOUNT- IN YOUR FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND ADVICE THAT'S THROUGH THIS S. F. D. R. REGULATION WHICH IS GETTING EVER AND TODAY IT'S QUITE GENERAL BUT THEY ARE GETTING EVER MORE PRESCRIPTIVE SO AS AS THIS SO IT JUST CAME INTO PLACE AND MARCH. BY EARLY NEXT YEAR THEY'RE GOING TO EVEN PRESCRIBED IN A MUCH MORE DETAILED WAY OF HOW THIS HAS TO HAPPEN SO TODAY'S MORE GENERAL DEMONSTRATIONS THAT YOU'VE DONE IT BUT THEY'RE GETTING INCREASINGLY MORE PRESCRIPTIVE. THAN ON THE PENSION FUND SO THIS IS THIS IS A FIDUCIARY OBLIGATION AS A PENSION FUND TRUSTEE IN SOME JURISDICTIONS IS ACTUALLY IN THE LAW- THAT IS PART OF YOUR FIDUCIARY DUTY AND IN OTHER CASES IT'S CONSIDERED WHAT'S BEST PRACTICE. AND SO IF YOU'RE A TRUSTEE YOU LOOK TO WHAT IS GUIDELINES AS BEST PRACTICES SO SOMETIMES IT'S THE SAME MANDATORY SOMETIMES IT'S MORE OF A KNOWLEDGE SO IT IT'S DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT. PARTS OF THE WORLD BUT I'D SAY THE VAST MAJORITY OF- PENSION REGULATIONS EITHER HAS THAT AS AN AS A KNOWLEDGE AND A GUIDELINE FOR ITS ACTUAL LAW IN FACT THE U. S. WAS ONE OF THE FEW MAJOR ECONOMIES WHERE. YOU WENT THE OTHER WAY UNDER THE LAST THIS SHE LED TO PROVE TAKING. FACTORS DIFFERENT. DID NOT RETURN. BUT THAT'S NOT BE. NEVER THAT WILL BE REVERSED WITH THE FINEST ALL THE SAME SIGNALS AND SIGNS ARE THAT THEY WILL FOLLOW SUIT WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. SO THE NUMBER IS REQUESTED- I WAS JUST WANTIN WHAT WAS SEEN FOR SPENT THOUGH OF IT LIKE IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T FOLLOW HAVE THERE BEEN ANY EXAMPLES OF ENFORCEMENT ACTION IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT. THIS IS ACTUALLY CAUSING A CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR FROM PENSION FUND INVESTORS. WELL YES YES YES FOR SURE- BECAUSE WE SEE IT IN. THE AMOUNT OF PENSION FUND MONEY THAT WANTS TO GET INVESTED IN ESG STRATEGIES SO THIS BIG GROWTH THAT WE'RE SEEING. IN THE MARKETS IT IS NOT JUST COMING FROM YOUR CLASSIC- PRIVATE ASSET MANAGERS- BUT IT'S ALSO COMING FROM THE PENSION FUND INDUSTRY. PENSION FUNDS ARE SAYING I MUST GET INVESTED IN THESE ESG STRATEGIES. SO YES IT'S ABSOLUTELY CHANGING BEHAVIOR AS PART OF THE DYNAMIC THAT'S UNDERPINNING THE GROWTH RATES- BUT WHAT DO REGULATORS ANY REGULARS HAVE THE POWER AT THEIR DISPOSAL. IF YOU WERE NOT TO COMPLY- THEN YOU KNOW THEY HAVE LOTS OF POWERS AT THEIR DISPOSAL THEY COULD FIND YOU- THEY COULD PROHIBIT YOU FROM DOING CERTAIN TYPES OF BUSINESS NOW A LOT OF THIS IS. NEW SO- PARTICULAR SAYS FDR SO IT'S ONLY ONLY JUST COMING MARCH SO THERE ISN'T ENOUGH OF THAT HISTORY THERE TO SAY FOR THOSE WHO ARE COMPLYING. YOU KNOW WHAT IS WHAT WHAT HAVE THEY DONE IN TERMS OF THE- FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THAT LEGISLATION. BUT AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE A REGULAR TELLING YOU AS A REGULATED ENTITY YOU MUST DO THIS- THE ENTIRE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY HAS RESPONDED ON WE'VE ALL. WORKED IN OUR S. F. E. R- DISCLOSURES THIS YEAR. SO I'D SAY YOU KNOW I CAN'T THINK OF A MAJOR INSTITUTION. THAT HAS NOT COMPLIED. OKAY WELL THANK YOU- I HAVE- WE WE'VE WE'VE USED UP AN HOUR AND A HALF OF OUR TIME AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT WE WILL BE MOVING TO PUBLIC COMMENTS IN A FEW MINUTES BUT I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU- IF I COULD AND IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT- PRESUMPTUOUS I GUESS ON MY PART BUT TO IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY OR POTENTIALLY CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT IF THERE WAS A- CONVERGENCE OF IDEAS- COULD. HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH CREDIT SUISSE AND YOU AS WE WENT THROUGH THE EXPLORATION OF THIS DO YOU THINK THERE'S AND I AND I KNOW WE'RE TALKING BIG PICTURE BUT YOU THINK THERE'S ANY INTEREST ON THE PART OF CREDIT SUISSE IS THERE ANY INTEREST ON THE PART OF YOU PERSONALLY OF CREATING SOME KIND OF INFORMAL OR FORMAL PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR THE ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AS WE TRY TO MANAGE IT YOU KNOW WE HAVE. THE INTERESTING CHALLENGE OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FORTY SENATORS AND EIGHTY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TRYING TO. DEVELOPING CRAFTED BILLS- AND YOU KNOW WE CAN GET PASSIONATE ABOUT A BILL AND I COULD SEE SOMEBODY STARTING OFF ONE WAY AND SUDDENLY. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A BILL THAT'S GOING TO BE CONSISTENT WITH STANDARDS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND- IT SEEMS LIKE IF WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF. PARTNERSHIP WHERE WE COULD AT LEAST. TAP YOUR EXPERTISE AND SKILL OTHERWISE I SEE US TRYING TO WITH OUR STAFFS AND OUR COMMITTEES TRYING TO RESEARCH AND- START FROM SCRATCH WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY SO FAR AHEAD OF US. COULD YOU COULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT A LITTLE BIT JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE NOT ARE WHAT WHAT. HELLO CERTAINLY I THINK MY MISSION AND MY MANDATE IS TO TRY TO HELP MOBILIZE CAPITAL FOR FIVE THOUSAND OF OUR MAIL SOCIAL OUTCOMES SO. AS PART OF MY MANDATE VERY MUCH ON THE BIG BELIEVER AND ACTUALLY TURNED BACK TO THE SDGS. SDG SEVENTEEN PARTNERSHIPS SO IT'S PART OF OUR SCHOOLS WHAT WE DO IS WE LOVE TO COLLABORATE LOVE TO. YOU KNOW HELP- SHARE BEST PRACTICE IDEAS WE DO HAVE A PRIVILEGED POSITION THE SENSE THAT YOU KNOW ISN'T WHAT WANTS TO SHOULD WE GET TO SEE A LOT OF THE ACTIVITY THAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE WORLD BOTH IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS BUT ALSO THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WHERE THOSE POCKETS WHERE WE'RE SEEING AN MAZING OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE VALUE. WITH PROMOTING NEW INDUSTRIES WHETHER THEY BE THE DISRUPTORS OR WHETHER IT BE FASTER TRANSITION WHAT HAVE YOU SO WE WOULD BE VERY VERY DELIGHTED TO SHARE. YOU KNOW WITH- WHERE WE CAN OUR EXPERTISE AND OUR KNOWLEDGE- AND WHAT WHATEVER THAT YOU KNOW WHATEVER FORM THAT TAKES- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WITHIN REASON IN TERMS OF OUR HUMAN CAPITAL BAND WITH- SO I TO- IT'S EXPLORED THIS IN IN WHATEVER CHANNEL MAKES SOME SENSE SO. WE'VE GOTTEN- MODES OF EXPERTS ON ON MY TEAM THAT IT WOULD BE I THINK VERY VERY PLEASED TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES. THAT'S THAT'S WONDERFUL TO HEAR AND- I DID YEAH I JUST FEEL ENCOURAGED AS WE HAVE. HAD GOOD INTEREST IN THIS PRESENTATION TODAY AND I THINK OUT OF THIS WILL COME- MORE INTERESTED HOW CAN WE CAN HOW CAN WE HARNESS- THIS WHOLE PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE TO HELP. OF CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT TRYING TO MOVE US ALL ALONG- I'M GETTING READY TO TURN IT TO THE PUBLIC- ARE CHECKED WITH MR GRAYSON ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE WE- WE GO TO THE PUBLIC ALL RIGHT. OF CHOI LIKE TO- QUESTIONS FROM THE- AND YOU'LL HAVE TO MANAGE- PER PERSON WE HAVE- TEN MINUTES OUT. FOR THIS- AND- WILL START HERE IN THE CHAMBER I DON'T SEE ANYBODY HERE THE CHAMBER ROOM FROM THE PUBLIC- AND SO WE WILL GO- TO THE- THE HEARING ROOM- ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS- FOR REMOTE TESTIMONY FROM THE HEARING ROOM AND I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY. CORRECT AND- THEN THE AMERICAN. NOBODY FROM THE REMOTE TESTIMONY IS THERE ANYBODY ON THE PHONE- THAT HAS QUESTIONS WOULD LIKE TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AND AGAIN WE INVITED YOU TO CALL IN- AND THAT WAS. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THEN USE THE ACCESS CODE. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY SIX TO THIRTY SEVEN SO I'LL REPEAT THAT ONE MORE TIME SO THE PHONE NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AN ACCESS CODE IS. TWO FOUR TWO SIX TWO THREE SEVEN. OPERATOR DO WE HAVE ANYBODY ON THE LINE. THANK YOU I CURRENTLY HAVE NO PUBLIC LINE'S DIALED IN OVER THE PHONE AT THIS TIME. OKAY WE'LL WAIT JUST A FEW MOMENTS AND- SEE IF WE HAVE ANYBODY AND. OPERATOR OF THE LINE STILL LARA STILL CLIP EMPTY. I STILL HAVE NO WENT OUT AND CURRENTLY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE TO BY LAW TO CREATE THAT OPPORTUNITY I HAVE- ONE OR TWO QUICK FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU AND- BEFORE WE END THIS AND SO CALIFORNIA COULD ISSUE GREEN BONDS AND I NOTICED THAT AMAZON ISSUED A BILLION DOLLAR GREEN BOND TODAY. EARLIER YOU TALKED ABOUT IN ASIA FUND AND YOU SAID THEY ISSUED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND I THOUGHT OF DID YOU MEAN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. SO YES- SO AMAZON I CAN QUICKLY COMMENT- WHICH I THINK IS A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF A COMPANY THAT'S ISSUED ITS OWN SUSTAINABILITY. BONDS AND THIS TOPIC THAT WE SAID ABOUT THE SUPPLY DEMAND EQUATION IN TERMS OF THEIR ESG OR SUSTAINABLE INVESTORS- REALLY REALLY WANTED BUT MORE MORE CAPITAL TO WORK BEHIND COMPANIES TO ARE GENUINELY TRYING TO- TO INVEST FOR POSITIVE OUTCOMES. SO THAT THE TRANSACTION AT AMAZON DID IT WAS EIGHTEEN AND A HALF BILLION U. S. DOLLARS ISSUANCE OF MANY DIFFERENT TRANCHES SO THEY WEREN'T ALSO STAND UP ALL. BUT IT HAD A TWO YEAR TRUNCHEON THE BILLION U. S. DOLLARS WHICH WAS SPECIFICALLY EARMARKED TO BE A SUSTAINABILITY TRONG CHI. SO THEY RAISE THAT CAPITAL AND WHAT THEY'VE COMMITTED TO DO IS INVEST THAT IN THINGS LIKE ELECTRIFICATION. OF THEIR TRUCKS AND THEIR DELIVERY VEHICLES THEY HAVE SAID THAT THEY WILL INVEST IN- TRYING TO TRANSITION THE SOURCES OF ENERGY IN THEIR FACILITIES TO MAKE IT ALL ABOUT GREEN ENERGY- THERE ALSO- SAID THEY WILL INVEST A PORTION OF THOSE PROCEEDS AND UPSKILLING THEIR WORKERS BACK TO THE S. OR THE S. IN THE E. ARE INTERTWINED HERE. AND SO ON AND THAT TRONG SHE WAS. HEAVILY HEAVILY OVERSUBSCRIBED BY ESG INVESTORS AND IT IS AT THE LOWEST- COUPON. LOWEST COST OF CAPITAL HI MONTHS ONLY FOR COMPANIES IN THE WORLD OF EFFORT ISSUES AT THIS LOW OF A RATE AN ABSOLUTE RATE IN HISTORY SO IT WAS TWENTY BASIS POINTS OVER TREASURYS- OR SORRY TEN WITH BASIS POINTS OVER TREASURYS. SO BACK TO THE IDEA THAT IT'S A WIN WIN FOR EVERYBODY SO THE ISSUERS CAN ACCESS DEDICATED POOLS OF CAPITAL FROM THESE COMMITTED ESG INVESTORS AT VERY-ATTRACTIVE RATES. THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES CAN ISSUED TO INVEST THAT MONEY AND POSITIVE OUTCOMES THAT CAN BOTH HELP MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE OBVIOUSLY GOOD FOR ALL OF US BUT ALSO HELP ON THE SOCIAL. SIDE WITH THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES SO I THINK IT'S AN- AND- OF BEING- COMPREHEND. AND THINKING OF WHAT'S IT CAN MEAN FROM THE BEST MASSAGE AND MAYBE HEALTH COULD DO. YOU. ISSUE YOUR OWN GREENER OR BY. AND PICK THE AREA THAT YOU ARE IMPORTANT- WHERE YOU WANTED PLAY CATCH. IT'S WAY JUST LIKE ANY ON IS NOT LIMITED TO CORPORATE. SO SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S LIKE A- A LITTLE INCENTIVE. TO SORT OF THINK HOLISTICALLY AND BROUGHT. ABOUT THIS- STAND TOP AND THEN SECONDOF YOUR I WAS MY TRIP RIGHT. YOU SEE THE SECOND PART OF MICHAEL. YEAH I SAID I WAS ON IT WAS. AND I'VE YOU I THINK YOU INTERNET WAS ASKING ABOUT OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT DID MS DO THAT MY FOLLOW UP TO THAT SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. COULD ISSUED GREEN BONDS AND GET VERY ATTRACTIVE INTEREST RATES ON THOSE IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE AT LEAST- IF AS LONG AS THEY IDENTIFIED THAT THOSE PROCEEDS ARE GOING TO BE USED SPECIFICALLY FOR. THESE APPROACH GREEN INVESTMENTS OR FOR OR JUST TRANSITION SUCH AS MUCH RIGHT TO COULD BE ESCALATED SIGNIFICANT WAY TO- TO DECREASE OUR COST OF CAPITAL- FOR THOSE KINDS OF BONDS AS YOU GO FOR. NOW WHAT WHAT COMES TO MY- IS. CONSTANTLY WE SEE IT IN L. A. N. IN THE WORLD PEOPLE FIND WAYS TO MANIPULATE WHATEVER SITUATION IS OUT THERE- I SEE RIGHT IN I CAN IMAGINE RIGHT NOW WITH THINGS BEING OVER SO. INTEREST RATES ARE VERY LOW AT THIS POINT TIME I WOULD IMAGINE WE WILL HAVE JUST AS YOU POINTED OUT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO ARBITRAGE AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO. TRY TO MANIPULATE THE SYSTEM THAT THERE WILL BE PEOPLE TRYING TO DO THAT IDENTIFYING THAT THIS IS A GREEN BOND WHEN IT'S YOU KNOW OUR IS IT REALLY GOING TO BE THAT AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE- THAT'S WHERE THE STANDARD ACCOUNTABILITY PRACTICES COME IN AND THE PROPER DEFINITIONS COMEY AND- PICK CENTER I ASSUME. TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW DO WE ENFORCE THAT AND HOW DO WE- DEVELOP DATA AS IT MOVES TOWARD A CERTAIN PRACTICES. THAT'S THAT VERY MUCH SO YES I DO SO- THERE IS A STANDARD IN THE MARKET- FOR WHAT IS DEFINED AS GREEN- FROM WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS ACCESSING THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS. SO TODAY WE HAVE FRAMEWORKS AND THEY'RE QUITE RIGOROUS AND TYPICALLY ISSUERS OF GREEN OR SOCIAL BONDS WILL HAVE A THIRD PARTY INSURANCE PROVIDER THAT LOOKS AT THE USE OF PROCEEDS AND SAYS YES THIS DOES COMPLY WITH WHAT MARKET STANDARD IS. AND WHEN THAT IS THAN THE LAST BY FOLLOWING THOSE FRAMEWORKS THEN THOSE SECURITIES CAN BE PART OF THE GREEN BOND INDICES AND THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT TO BOTH FROM THE AFTER MARKET TRADING POINT OF VIEW BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF. THE ISSUE IS FUTURE ACCESS TO GREEN CAPITAL SO- THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A- WELL DEFINED AND NOW REASONABLY MATURE PROCESS AND THAT'LL THAT I THINK- IS AND SHALL WE SAY KEEPS THE ISSUE AS HONEST. AND AVOID GREENWASHING SO SOME OF THESE STANDARDS THAT ARE. BEING CREATED AS AS THESE MARKETS MATURE ARE HELPING TO CREATE INTEGRITY TO THE MARKETS AND GIVE CONFIDENCE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY BUT- I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH YOU KNOW WHAT IS DEFINED AS GREEN WITHIN THE. I REQUEST YOU HAVE GIVEN US AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF- POSITIVE ENERGY AND THINGS TO THINK ABOUT- FOR THE LEGISLATURE BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. WE REALLY APPRECIATE- THE GENUINE SPIRIT OF- COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED NOT JUST TODAY BUT IN OUR CONVERSATIONS BEFORE TO GET THIS SET UP SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IT MEANS. A LOT TO ME PERSONALLY IT MEANS A LOT TO- ALL OF US HERE IN CALIFORNIA- TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH- PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF WHO ARE. REALLY TRYING TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE- FROM THE WORLD- AS WE GO FORWARD SO- WITH THAT- SURE GO OVER- MISTER GRATION IS FINE AND- WE WILL LET YOU- ESCAPE A LITTLE BIT EARLY AND NOT KNOW WHAT'S AND LATE EVENING FOR YOU THERE IN CONNECTICUT SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR US TO DREW- THE- I'M SO. PLEASURE AND BUT I THINK YOU JUST HAVE YOU SO MUCH I. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ABOUT THE THAT. KNOWN YOUR- CAN THERE'S A HUGE. FOR TO CAN TO FIGHT EVER SYSTEM- THERE'S SO MUCH. AT WORK THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO OF YOUR- YOU KNOW- IN IN. INDUSTRY SECTOR TECH ITSELF ITS OWN YOU. THE GREENTECH METER ON WORLD YOU AT EVERY LEAD. OPPORTUNITY TO JUST THAT NO AND I. INVESTING BILLIONS INTO TECH TO AS PART OF THIS NEXT YEAR COME IN. YOU KNOW UP CALLOUS FOR ALWAYS LEADERS AND OF ITS A- APOLLO. GENERALLY ANYTHING BECAUSE I'M- HERE. WITH. THEN HOPEFULLY YOU CAPTURED THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF. YOUR POPULOUS AND THEN EVERYBODY IS SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AGENDA SO I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH THAT. EVERY EVERY TIME YOU UP WITH THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA FOR CALIFORNIA DON'T HESITATE TO CONTACT US AFTER ANY. I WILL DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE A GOOD DAY. I THANK YOU BYE BYE THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED. THANK YOU.
