MR FRAZIER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED OPEN ON THIS MATTER THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT ACR SEVENTY SEVEN PROCLAIMING APRIL IS DISTRACTED DRIVING AWARENESS MONTH.

TALKING ON A CELL PHONE PERSONAL GROOMING OR ADJUSTING THE RADIO JUST TO NAME A FEW. MEMBERS LET ME GIVE YOU SOME SAID TO STATISTICS ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION. 73% OF DRIVERS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS OLD ADMIT TO TEXTING WHILE DRIVING. TO PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT TO READER TYPE THE AVERAGE TAX TAKES ABOUT FOUR POINT SIX SECONDS. IN JUST THREE SECONDS OF TEXTING WHILE DRIVING AT SIXTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR. A VEHICLE COVERS ONE HUNDRED YARDS OR THE LENGTH OF A FOOTBALL FIELD. BLINDFOLDED. CAN YOU IMAGINE DRIVING ON A CROWDED HIGHWAY IN AND TOLD TO KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED FOR OVER FIVE SECONDS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL ISSUED OVER ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT THOUSAND CITATIONS FOR EITHER TEXTING OR TALKING WHILE DRIVING. IN THE C. H. P. WAS FUNDED TO FILL THE VACANCIES. THIS NUMBER WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. THE MOST RECENT STATISTICS FROM THE OFFICE OF TRAFFIC SAFETY REPORTED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN DEATHS ON CALIFORNIA ROADS AS A RESULT OF DISTRACTED DRIVING. ON AUGUST TENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN OFFICER CURRENT RHYS WAS PERFORMING A ROUTINE TRAFFIC STOP. ON I EIGHTY IN SOLANO COUNTY.

ONE FORTY ONE MOVING TO FILE ITEM ONE FORTY ONE ACR FIFTY FOR THE CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION FIFTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO CALIFORNIA HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY. MR GABRIEL YOU MAY OPEN ON A C. R.. FIFTY FOUR THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS 2% ACR. FIFTY FOUR IN HONOR OF HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY. TODAY WE TEMPORARILY SET ASIDE OUR USUAL OUR USUAL LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS TO RECALL THE HORRORS OF THE HOLOCAUST. TO HONOR THE MEMORY OF ITS VICTIMS AND TO RECOGNIZE THE SURVIVORS. TODAY WE GRIEVE FOR ALL VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST WHICH INCLUDES NOT ONLY JEWS BUT ALSO ROMA. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES GAY PEOPLE AND POLITICAL OPPONENTS OF THE **** REGIME. AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE HOLOCAUST WAS FIRST AND FOREMOST IN EFFORT TO DESTROY THE JEWISH PEOPLE. THREE RACE US FROM HISTORY. THE HARM ARE ARE THE HALLMARKS OF THE HOLOCAUST WERE EXTRAORDINARY EFFICIENCY. INCREDIBLE BRUTALITY SHOCKING SILENCE AND PAINFUL COMPLICITY. IN A FEW SHORT YEARS THE **** MURDERED SIX MILLION JEWS INCLUDING ONE MILLION JEWISH CHILDREN. AND DECIMATED EUROPEAN JEWRY. AT EVERY CONCEIVABLE OPPORTUNITY THE **** SOUGHT TO HUMILIATE AND DE HUMANIZE TO USE. TO DEPRIVE THE VICTIMS OF THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR DIGNITY AND TO PROVE THE SUPPOSE IT A RACIAL INFERIORITY OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE. IN MANY COMMUNITIES WERE JEWS HAVE LIVED FOR CENTURIES THEIR NEIGHBOR STOOD BY SILENTLY. OR EAGERLY COLLABORATED WITH THE ASSISTING WITH THE IDENTIFICATION AND MURDER OF THEIR JEWISH NEIGHBORS AND COLLEAGUES. AND SO TODAY AS WE DO EVERY YEAR WE PAUSE AND REMEMBER THE HOLOCAUST. WE MUST REMEMBER IT BECAUSE THE TEMPTATION TO IGNORE IT IS OVERWHELMING. AFTER ALL IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE TO THINK ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST. TO IMAGINE FAMILIES PACKED TIGHTLY INTO CATTLE CARS OR MOTHERS WITH INFANTS BEING SHOVED INTO GAS CHAMBERS. TO EXPLAIN MOBILE KILLING SQUADS AND DEATH MARCHES IN MASS STARVATION. TO THINK ABOUT CHILDREN AND OLD PEOPLE WHO WERE LOCKED INSIDE SYNAGOGUES AND BURNED ALIVE. TO IMAGINE THE SMOKE AND ASHES FROM THE CREMATORIA. YET WE MUST OURSELVES UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE THE MEMORY IS OUR BEST TOOL TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING LIKE THE HOLOCAUST EVER HAPPENS AGAIN. WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THE HOLOCAUST BECAUSE IN TOO MANY PLACES INCLUDING IN OUR OWN COUNTRY IT IS FADING FROM MEMORY. RECENT POLLS SUGGEST THAT 50% OF AMERICANS LACK BASIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST. AND 20% OF MILLENNIALS HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT. THIS YEAR WE REMEMBER THE HOLOCAUST AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A DRAMATIC SURGE IN ANTI SEMITIC INCIDENTS IN THE US. AND AROUND THE GLOBE. JUST TWO DAYS AGO IN OUR OWN STATE WE WITNESSED AND YET ANOTHER ACT OF VIOLENT ANTI SEMITISM. A TRAGIC SHOOTING THAT FELL ON THE SIX MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KILLING OF ELEVEN WORSHIPERS AT THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE IN PITTSBURGH. IN BETWEEN THESE DEADLY ATTACKS THE CALIFORNIA JEWISH COMMUNITY HAS ENTERED A SERIES OF ANTI SEMITIC INCIDENTS. AND BEEN ALARMED BY THE INFUSION OF ANTI SEMITISM INTO OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE. AS WE REFLECT ON THESE INCIDENTS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE HOLOCAUST DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. IT DID NOT BEGIN WITH GAS CHAMBERS AND DEATH MARCHES. IT BEGAN WITH WORDS AND DEEDS OF A MUCH MORE MODEST NATURE. WITH HATEFUL RHETORIC AND PERVASIVE RACISM AND DISCRIMINATORY LAWS. WITH THE DEMOCRATIC ELECTION THAT BROUGHT HITLER TO POWER. WITH PROPAGANDA THEY CONVINCED A HIGHLY EDUCATED AND ENLIGHTENED SOCIETY THE NATION OF BEETHOVEN AND BACH. TO EMBRACE A CAMPAIGN OF MASS MURDER. WE MUST REMIND OURSELVES OF THE TRAJECTORY OF GENOCIDE. AND RECALL THAT HATE SPEECH AND SEEMINGLY ISOLATED ACTS OF VIOLENCE CAN QUICKLY ESCALATE. AND SO TODAY WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR ACR. FIFTY FOUR TO DEMONSTRATE THE CALIFORNIANS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS WILL STAND TOGETHER TO RECALL THE HORRORS OF THE HOLOCAUST. TO TEACHERS UNIVERSAL LESSONS TO OUR CHILDREN. AND TO FORCEFULLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMN ANTI SEMITISM BIGOTRY AND HATRED OF ALL FORMS. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL. IS KHAN LONGER W. ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I RISE. IN SUPPORT OF A C. R. FIFTY FOUR WHICH RECOGNIZES TODAY AS CALIFORNIA HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SOLEMN OCCASION IS TO APPLY LESSONS FROM THE PAST TO CURRENT EVENTS. DURING THE **** REGIME HITLER SEWED HATE THROUGH HIS DISCRIMINATORY LANGUAGE. CREATING PREJUDICE AND INTOLERANCE AGAINST JEWS AND OTHER PERSECUTED PEOPLE. RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF EIGHT MILLION MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN MORE THAN THE POPULATIONS OF LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO SAN JOSE AND SAN FRANCISCO COMBINED. HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY CALLS ON ALL OF US WHETHER CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM. BLACK OR WHITE. FROM BERKELEY TO BAKERSFIELD. TO RECOGNIZE THE EVILS OF RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA. AND SERVES AS A REMINDER FOR HOW EVEN THE MOST ADVANCED SOCIETIES. CAN DESCEND INTO DARKNESS. IT IS APPROPRIATE TO MENTION RECENT EVENTS. WHILE SPEAKING TO THIS RESOLUTION. SHOOTINGS IN POWER AWAY AND ATTACKS ON MOSQUES IN SUNNYVALE. SHOULD NEVER BE CONDONED. OR EVEN ALLOWED. BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO ADVANCE AND HE'LL. WE MUST COME TO RECKONING WITH OUR HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY. WHAT IS ALL? OFTEN COMES BACK IN STYLE. BUT YOU CHEN X. AND SHOULDER PADS ARE NOT THE SAME. WE ARE LIVING TWENTY NINETEEN STYLE. WHAT OUR COUNTRY SO TO OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO? WHEN WE PASSED THE IMMIGRATION ACT OF? NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR ITS PRIMARY FOCUS WAS TO PROTECT WHITE PURITY AND KEEP IMMIGRANTS OUT. INCLUDING JEWS. HELLER USED OUR IMMIGRATION ACT. AS PART OF HIS PLAYBOOK. FOR HIS RHETORIC AND HIS REGIME. AND HE STUDIED HOW WE DEALT WITH INTEGRATION. AND NOW IN. TWENTY NINETEEN WE SEE MUSLIMS AND JEWS SLAUGHTERED IN THEIR HOUSES OF WORSHIP. WE SEE AFRICAN AMERICANS EUROPE PURGED THROUGH OUR SOCIAL SYSTEMS. AND WE SEE PEOPLE FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA DENIED ASYLUM. OUR HISTORY. IS NOT READY. BUT OUR PRESENCE. IS BECOMING EQUALLY DARK. STANDING AGAINST BIGOTRY DOESN'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE THE SAME RISKS FACED BY THOSE WHO HATE JEWS IN THEIR HOMES OR THOSE WHO PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTED ANSI ANTI **** PROPAGANDA. IT DOES REQUIRE US TO LIVE IN A WAY IN WHICH WE'VE LEARNED FROM OUR PAST. BY WORKING TOGETHER TO PRESERVE FREEDOM FOR ALL FAITHS. OFFER HAVEN FOR VICTIMS OF PERSECUTION CONFRONT BIAS HATRED AND VIOLENCE IN ALL ITS FORMS AND SPREAD MESSAGES OF LOVE ACCEPTANCE AND UNDERSTANDING. BY TAKING A STAND. IS IT ABOUT PROTECTING A MASTER RACE. OR IS IT ABOUT RESPECTING A DIVERSE DEMOCRACY. WE MAY DISAGREE ON A LOT OF THINGS. WE MAY DISAGREE ON A LOT OF IMPORTANT THINGS. BUT WE SHOULD ALL AGREE. THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER BE GUNNED DOWN. IN YOUR HOUSE OF WORSHIP. THE TORONTO TEACHES US THE TORAH TEACHES US. SAID ECSTATIC [inaudible] JUSTICE JUSTICE YOU SHALL PURSUE.

OUTFITS AND YAD VASHEM -- THE OFFICE MUSEUM IN YAD VASHEM HAVE. TWITTER ACCOUNTS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY POST THIS INFORMATION. AND THERE IS A NEW SERIES COMING OUT. ON INSTAGRAM. AND I I USUALLY TELL CHILDREN. DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO SOCIAL MEDIA. THERE IS AN ACCOUNT. EVA DOT STORIES ON INSTAGRAM. HISTORIANS FOUND A DIARY OF A GIRL WHO DIED IN THE HOLOCAUST NAMED EVA. AND ONE OF HER WISHES WRITTEN IN THAT DIARY WAS TO HAVE A CAMERA. SHE WANTED TO DOCUMENT WHAT WAS OCCURRING. AROUND HER FROM THE LIFE THAT SHE ENJOYED BEING PART OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN EUROPE. TO THE BEING FORCED INTO A GHETTO. BEING TAKEN. TO A DEATH CAMP. AND HISTORIANS FOUND THIS DIARY. AND THEY DECIDED TO PUT. A SMART. IN HER HANDS. AND ANA INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT THEY HAVE. DOCUMENTED THIS GIRL'S LIFE. AS IF SHE WAS ABLE. TO DOCUMENT IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA THE WAY SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE DOCUMENT THEIR LIVES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AND I ENCOURAGE YOU -- TO CHECK THIS OUT EVEN DOT STORIES AND TO SHARE WITH OTHERS SO THAT THEY TOO CAN LEARN ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MARKING THE STATE TOGETHER. THANK YOU MISTER LEVINE MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY IS MUCH MORE THAN A CEREMONY TO RECOGNIZE SURVIVORS OF HISTORY'S MOST TERRIBLE GENOCIDE. IT'S A TIME TO REMEMBER THE HORRORS THAT OCCURRED BUT ALSO A TIME TO DEDICATE OURSELVES TO ENSURING THAT IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. WE WERE REMINDED OF THIS IMPORTANCE OF THIS JUST TWO DAYS AGO IN SAN DIEGO. WHEN A MAN DRIVEN BY HATE IT TACK THE TRIAL BUT A OF POWER A SYNAGOGUE? ON THE LAST DAY OF PASSOVER. KILLING ONE WOMAN AND WOUNDING THREE OTHER WORSHIPERS. THIS HORRIFIC ACT OF VIOLENCE SHOWED US THAT HATE AND ANTI SEMITISM HAVE NOT GONE AWAY IN THE DECADE SINCE THE HOLOCAUST. UNFORTUNATELY AS THERE ARE FEWER FIRST HAND WITNESSES TO THE HOLOCAUST EACH YEAR. OUR COLLECTIVE MEMORY OF THESE EVENTS. MAY BE FADING. LAST YEAR A SURVEY SHOWED THAT MILLENNIALS BELIEVE THE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN SIX MILLION JEWS WERE KILLED. HALF OF MILLENNIALS COULD NOT NAME A SINGLE CONCENTRATION CAMP. TODAY WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO NOT ONLY REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS. BUT FIGHTING THE HATRED AND ANTI SEMITISM THAT ALLOW THE HOLOCAUST TO TAKE PLACE. WE MUST ROOT OUT HATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND DO ALL WE CAN TO PREVENT IT FROM GAINING A FOOTHOLD. AND WE MUST TEACH FUTURE GENERATIONS ABOUT THE HORRORS OF THE HOLOCAUST TO PREVENT THEM FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN. THAT IS THE TRUE MEANING OF HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON MISTER NAZARIAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I'D LIKE TO ALSO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM WEST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY -- FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT CONTINUES. TO BURN THE ETERNAL FLAME IN MEMORY OF THOSE THAT WE HAVE LOST. AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM MARIN WHO SO SAYS SIMPLY AND APTLY. SHOWN THREE PICTURES OF THE SIX MILLION. SO THAT WE DON'T THINK ABOUT IT IN JUST THE TESTINGS. IS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IT DE HUMANIZES. WHEN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT ISSUES IN THE CONTEXT OF NUMBERS? SO I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THOSE THREE PICTURES FORWARD. MADAM SPEAKER ON BEHALF OF THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR. FIFTY FOUR TO ESTABLISH CALIFORNIA HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY. IN THE DARKEST MOMENT OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HITLER LETTER GENOCIDE THAT RESULTED IN THE SENSELESS DEATH OF ELEVEN MILLION. INDIVIDUALS [inaudible] INDIVIDUALS. WHICH DOES NOT ACCOUNT ALSO FOR ALL THE POSTTRAUMATIC IMPACTS AND THE POTENTIAL SUICIDES AND DEATHS THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED. FOR THIS RESOLUTION ENSURES THAT OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THIS BLIGHT. IN OUR WORLD HISTORY. WE NEED TO LEARN THIS HISTORY. SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THE HOLOCAUST NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. THIS DAY IS ALSO ABOUT RECOGNISING THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE NEEDED TO FIGHT AGAINST INJUSTICE. JEWISH AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE AS COALITION PARTNERS WITH JAPANESE AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS. IN ADVOCATING FOR REDRESS FOR JAPANESE AMERICAN INTERNMENT. THIS WEEKEND'S VIOLENCE SHOOTING AS A AT A SYNAGOGUE AND POWER WAY. IS A TRAGIC AN URGENT REMINDER THAT WE MUST NOT KEEP SILENT IN THE FACE OF BIGOTRY AND HATRED. WE MUST STAND UNITED ACROSS ALL FAITHS AND BACKGROUNDS AND WORK TOGETHER BY SPEAKING UP FOR PEACE. PLEASE JOIN ME IN VOTING I ON THE RIGHT ON THIS RESOLUTION SO THAT WE CAN REFLECT ON THE LIES. LIVES OF THOSE LOST IN WORLD WAR TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER NAZARIAN MISTER GLORIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE LGBT. Q. CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF ACR. FIFTY FOUR TODAY WE REMEMBER THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE LOST DURING THE HOLOCAUST IN HONOR THOSE WHO SURVIVED THIS HEINOUS ATTEMPTS AT EXTERMINATION. MANY GROUPS AS YOU MAY KNOW -- WERE PRO TARGET AND PERSECUTED IN THE HOLOCAUST ALONGSIDE THE JEWISH COMMUNITY THAT OF COURSE UNFORTUNATELY INCLUDES OUR LGBT COMMUNITY. HITLER SAW THESE INNOCENT PEOPLE AS A THREAT TO WHAT HE BELIEVED WAS THE SUPERIOR RACE. THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE QUOTE UNFIT TO DEFEND THE NATION IN COMBAT. AND WOULD DIMINISH GERMAN REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL. EVEN IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS LGBT Q. INMATES WERE KEPT IN SEPARATE FACILITIES FOR FEAR THAT HOMOSEXUALITY WOULD SPREAD TO OTHER PRISONERS. WOULD HAVE RAZA WAS ONE SUCH SURVIVOR. HE WAS AT BUCK IN WALL. HE WAS PINK TRIANGLE NUMBER. SEVENTY NINE FIFTY TWO HE WORE THAT PAIN TRIANGLE UNTIL HIS LIBERATION BY U. S. ARMED FORCES IN. NINETEEN FORTY FIVE WHEN HE PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY ELEVEN BROWSER WAS THE LAST KNOWN SURVIVOR TO WEAR THE PINK TRIANGLE. THE EMBLEM THE HOMOSEXUALS HAD TO WEAR. IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS. AND WHILE HE MADE IT A POINT THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE TO SHARE HIS STORY AND THE STORY OF LGBT Q. VICTIMS OF THE ****. AND THE SURVIVORS OF ALL THE ALL THE SURVIVORS OF THE HOLOCAUST. WE KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES THESE STORIES ARE OMITTED FROM HOLOCAUST LITERATURE. AND EDUCATION. THIS EXCLUSION IS OF COURSE THE NATURAL EVOLUTION OF GLOBAL HOMOPHOBIA. BUT AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED IT IS ALSO PART OF A GREATER ANTI SEMITIC EFFORT TO RACE THIS DARK HISTORY PART PART OF OUR HUMAN HISTORY. FROM THE HISTORY BOOKS. WE MUST SPREAD WOULD OFF STORY AND ALL OF THOSE. WHO ARE PERSECUTED AND HOLOCAUST ESPECIALLY THOSE FOLKS WHOSE NAMES WILL NEVER BE KNOWN? WHO SPACES AND STORIES WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL? IT IS IN THAT SPIRIT THAT ARE LGBT Q. CAUCUS [inaudible] HAS CHOSEN. TO RECLAIM AND TO LIFT UP THE PINK TRIANGLE NOT AS THE SYMBOL OF THE EIGHT OFF HITLER MEANT TO TO BE. BUT AS A SYMBOL OF THE PERSEVERANCE OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT GO QUIETLY. AS WEEK KNOWLEDGE THE HOLOCAUST AT THE TIME IN OUR HISTORY WE MUST RECOGNIZE OF COURSE THAT HATE IS STILL ALIVE AND SO VERY PRESENT IN OUR MODERN DAY SOCIETY. AS A MEMBER OF THE SAN DIEGO LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION. MANY OF US WERE HORRIFIED AND ANGERED. BY THE ACTIONS OF A LONE INDIVIDUAL THIS PAST SATURDAY IN OUR HOME COUNTY. WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE WAS TO KILL PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WERE JEWISH. THIS IS A MOMENTOUS BECAUSE ALL OF US TO PAUSE AND RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING SIMPLY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST BUT SOMETHING THAT WE MUST BATTLE EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH EVERYTHING. THAT WE HAVE LIVES ARE AT STAKE MEMBERS. ABOVE ALL TODAY. THE CALIFORNIA LGBT Q. CAUCUS STANDS IN SOLIDARITY. WITH OUR FELLOW CAUCUS IN THE JEWISH CAUCUS. AND WE RISE UP WE WILL RISE UP AND WE'LL FIGHT AGAINST ANYONE WHO CLAIMS THAT THEIR IDENTITY IS SUPERIOR. AND OF COURSE WE WILL BE FOR A FREE AN EQUITABLE AND SAVE SOCIETY FOR ALL OF US. OUR CAUCUS OR DID YOU ALL TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF A. C. R.. FIFTY FOUR THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA MISS FRIEDMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS RESOLUTION. MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF A C. R.. FIFTY FOUR AND LET ME SAY WHAT AN HONOR IT IS TO HAVE SO MANY SURVIVORS ON THE FLOOR THIS TODAY. IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU ALL HERE THANK YOU. OF THE MILLIONS THAT PERISHED DURING THE HOLOCAUST WOMEN WERE SUBJECTED TO SOME OF THE MOST INHUMANE TREATMENT. MOTHERS WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND MOTHERS WERE OFTEN MARCHED INTO THE GAS CHAMBERS WITH THEIR CHILDREN. I REMEMBER THAT AT THE TIME MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SENT TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS KNEW FULL WELL THE FATE THAT WAS GOING TO AWAIT THEM THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO THEIR DEATH. IMAGINE BEING ONE OF THOSE WOMEN HAVING TO MARCH INTO A GAS CHAMBER WITH YOUR CHILDREN. AND THEN TO HAVE TO WATCH THEM SUCCUMB TO THE GASES BEFORE YOU TWO MET YOUR DEATH I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE HORRIFYING AS A MOTHER MYSELF. JEWISH AND GYPSY WOMEN WERE OFTEN RAPED AND TORTURED BY NOT SEASON WERE SUBJECTED. TO HORRIFIC EXPERIMENTS AND EXPERIMENTS THAT IF THEY SURVIVE LET THEM SEVERAL. AND DISFIGURED. YESTERDAY MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS IN MY MYSELF AMONGST THEM. HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SITTING DOWN IN A ROUND TABLE WITH A GROUP OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS I GOT TO MEET A WOMAN NAME RENEE FIRESTONE WHO WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD WHEN ALONG WITH HER PARENTS SHE WAS SENT BY CATTLE CARS TO AUSCHWITZ. NOW HER FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SISTER. WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO WAS SUBJECTED TO INCREDIBLY CRUEL AND INHUMANE MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS AND THEN EXECUTED BY THE ****. RENEE HERSELF SOMEHOW SURVIVE MIRACULOUSLY BUT SHE DIDN'T JUST SURVIVE SHE WENT ON TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FASHION DESIGNERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. SHE THRIVED. AND TO ME ONE OF THE GREAT LESSONS OF THE HOLOCAUST IS ONE OF SURVIVAL. AND OF SUCCESS AFTER SURVIVING. AND THAT SHOWS THAT EVERYTHING THAT HITLER DID. WAS PROVEN TO BE A GREAT FAILURE A FAILURE FOR HIS NATION THE FAILURE FOR THOSE WHO FOLLOWED HIM -- TO THEIR GREAT SHAME HER FAILURE TO TO GERMANY THAT STILL LIVES ON BUT THOSE WHO SURVIVED WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE REBUILD. EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND I THINK IT'S THAT SURVIVAL THAT SO MANY OF US DRAW INSPIRATION FROM TODAY. NO I WANT TO MENTION TO IS TO DO ONE THING THAT I THINK IS NOT OFTEN OBVIOUSTO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT JEWISH. AND MY FAMILY WE HAVE SURVIVORS IN MY FAMILY AND MY GRANDFATHER'S FAMILY. OF THE ENTIRE FAMILY TREE WAS WIPED OUT ONLY A FEW PEOPLE SURVIVED. BUT MANY OF US ONLY HAVE JUDAISM AS THE CORE OF OUR IDENTITY I ONLY RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT I HAVE FAMILY FROM LAFIA. THOSE ROUTES WERE WIPED AWAY FOR SO MANY OF US IN THOSE FAMILY STORIES MY GRANDPARENTS MANY OF THEIR GENERATION REFUSED TO SPEAK ABOUT EXPERIENCES THAT THEY HAD. WE'RE ONLY LEARNING ABOUT THAT NOW FROM SURVIVORS WHO ARE WILLING TO SPEAK AND WHO ARE WILLING TO COME FORWARD AND GIVE ORAL HISTORIES AND TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. MOST OF MY FAMILY'S HISTORY IS LOST ITS LUSTER TIME I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE IN THE WORLD THEY COME FROM. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO PUT ALL OF THAT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND WE'LL NEVER KNOW MOST OF THOSE STORIES. SO I I PERSONALLY WANT TO THANK THE SURVIVORS WHO ARE GIVING THEIR VOICES TO BRING THAT HISTORY BACK TO LIFE FOR SO MANY OF US FOR PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF. WE HAVE THOSE THOSE FRAGMENTS TO CLING TO SO YOU'RE GIVING US A GIFT WHEN YOU SHARE OUR HIS COLLECTIVE HISTORY SO THANK YOU. AND I DO WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT THE ROLE THAT SO MANY WOMEN PLAYED IN SAVING LIVES IN WORLD WAR TWO AND THE HOLOCAUST LIBERATING PRISONERS FIGHTING FOR THE RESISTANCE. HIDING THOSE BEHIND IT NOW VOICING THAT HISTORY. THEY WERE HER ROGUE WOMEN LIKE HANNAH XIN US WHO JOINED THE BRITISH ARMY IN ORDER TO RESCUE PEOPLE THIRTY SEVEN JEWS INCLUDING HANNAH IMAGINE BEING A YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT TRAINING PARACHUTING. INTO OCCUPIED AREAS TO FREE PRISONERS. HANNAH WAS EVENTUALLY CAPTURED AND MURDERED BY THE **** OF FATE THAT I'M SURE THAT SHE KNEW SHE FACED BUT IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HER TO SAVE OTHER LIVES THAT SHE SACRIFICED HERSELF. I HAVE A NEIGHBOR NAMED CHRISTA MILLER WHO SOME OF YOU HAD THE HONOR OF MEETING A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN I BROUGHT HER UP HERE ON HOLOCAUST DAY. CHRIS SO HER PARENTS. WHERE HER FATHER WAS A PROMINENT SS OFFICER ****? HER UNCLE CLAUS VON STAUFFENBERG WAS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS OF THE FAILED ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AGAINST HITLER. KRISTA AND HER FAMILY NOW HER PARENTS WERE EXECUTED FOR THEIR PART IN THE THE ATTEMPT THE CHRISTIAN HER FAMILY WERE SENT TO A TRADERS CAMP. IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS WITH THE CHILDREN OF OTHER TRADERS OF THE STORY AND THE STORY OF HER OF HER PARENTS. TODAY WE PAY TRIBUTE TO ALL OF THOSE HEROES AND THE ROLES THAT THEY HAD AND ONE OF THE DARKEST CHAPTERS OF HISTORY. WE HONOR THEIR SACRIFICE. THEIR SPIRIT AND THEIR STRENGTH THEIR PERSEVERANCE AND THEIR BRAVERY IN THEIR LEADERSHIP. WE CARRY THE LIGHT WITH US TODAY WAS TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR EQUALITY JUSTICE AND PEACE. I URGE ALL OF YOU. TO VOTE FOR A. C. R. FIFTY FOUR I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN MR GABRIEL YOU MAY CLOSE ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND I I JUST FIRST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES AND AND ON THE CAUCUSES. FOR FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND FOR YOUR REALLY BEAUTIFUL WORDS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW JEWS ARE. A TINY MINORITY WE MAKE UP LESS THAN ONE QUARTER OF 1% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION AS I'VE SHARED WITH MANY OF YOU. THERE ARE MORE LATINOS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE JEWS IN THE WORLD AND SO IT IS DEEPLY MEANINGFUL FOR US TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT IN YOUR SOLIDARITY ON THIS RESOLUTION AND DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME FOR OUR COMMUNITY. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE MENTION IN HER BEAUTIFUL REMARKS A NUMBER OF US WERE FORTUNATE YESTERDAY -- TO TO SIT DOWN AND AND MEET WITH SOME SURVIVORS OF THE HOLOCAUST. AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET A A REALLY SPECIAL WOMAN BY THE NAME OF A EVEN A FENCE AND SHE'S AN ARTIST WHO HAS WORKED WITH GETTING INVOLVED YOUTH IN LOS ANGELES. AND SHE'S A CHILD SURVIVOR OF THE HOLOCAUST AND SHE SHARED WITH ME HER STORY. SHE'S A A HUNGARIAN JEW BY BIRTH AT THE END OF THE WAR IN DECEMBER OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR JANUARY. NINETEEN FORTY FIVE THE **** WERE RACING AGAINST THE CLOCK TO KILL AS MANY JEWS AS THEY COULD BEFORE THE WAR WAS OVER THE WRITING WAS ON THE WALL BUT THEY WERE STILL PUSHING FORWARD WITH THEIR CAMPAIGN OF EXTERMINATION. IT'S ON A NUMBEROF OF OF DAYS THE **** AND THEIR HUNGARIAN COLLABORATORS -- EXECUTED ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND JEWS BY SHOOTING THEM AND PUSHING THEM INTO THE DANUBE RIVER. AND THE WAY THAT THEY DID THIS MOST EFFICIENTLY IN ORDER TO SAVE BULLETS WAS TO TIE THREE PEOPLE TOGETHER. THEY WERE T&lt;c.cyan&gt; THREE PEOPLE&lt;/c&gt; TOGETHER AND THEY WHICH SHE ONE OF THEM AND PUSH THEM INTO THE RIVER AND THEN THAT PERSONWOULD TRACK DOWN ALL THREE OF THEM. AND THEY WERE DROWNED. SO A ABOUT AS A FOUR AND A HALF YEAR OLD GIRL FOUND HERSELF ON THE BANKS OF THE DANUBE TIED TO HER MOTHER. AND TIED TO ANOTHER FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL. AND WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME IS THAT THE HUNGARIAN MARKSMAN WHO WAS EXECUTING FOLKS RECOGNIZE THEM AS SOMEONE FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT THAT HE NOW. IT'S WE CAME OVER THE MOTHER HE WHISPERED I KNOW THAT THE WAR'S ALMOST OVER AND I'M GONNA NEED SOMEONE TO STAND UP AND TESTIFY ON MY BEHALF AND AND HELP. SAVE ME WHEN THE WAR'S OVER SO IF YOU'RE WILLING TO DO THAT THEN I I WON'T KILL YOU RIGHT NOW I'LL SHOOT YOU BUT I'LL SHOOT NOT TO KILL. THIS OF COURSE ON THE SPOT AVIS MOM ACCEPTED THAT DEAL THE MARKSMEN SHOT HER IN THE ARM THEY WERE PUSHED INTO THE RIVER. AND THEY LAY ON THE BANK OF BANKS OF THE RIVER FOR SEVERAL HOURS UNTIL THE EXECUTIONS FINISH THE THE RIVER WAS CHOKED WITH BODIES. AND THEN THEY SNUCK AWAY. AND EVER SURVIVED THE WAR. HER SHE IS A MIRACLE AND EVERYONE OF THE SURVIVORS THAT ARE WITH US TODAY ARE A MIRACLE. IT'S ON THEIR BEHALF AND RECOGNITION OF THEM I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON A C. R..

THIS SMALL GROUP IN TOWARD AGAINST ALL ODDS AND WE'RE THE ULTIMATE WITNESSES TO HATRED AND THE HUMAN BRUTALITY THEY CAN STEM FROM IT.
