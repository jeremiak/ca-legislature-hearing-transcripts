A BRIEF REPORT WE PUT OUT IN OUR

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.610
BUDGET PUBLICATION IN FEBRUARY --

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:52.078
IT PROVIDES CONTEXT FOR THE

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.279
RELATIVELY MODEST BUDGET

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:54.614
PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.149

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.283
WAS THAT IT ALSO CREATE A

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.486
FRAMING FOR A MUCH LARGER

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:00.687
CONVERSATION THAT.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:02.388
LIKELY WILL BE FACING YOU IN THE

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.591
MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME AROUND

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.160
COASTAL ADAPTATION -- SO TURNING

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.461
TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:10.129
CALIFORNIA'S COAST FACES THE

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.632
THREAT OF RISING SEEDS AND TAXIS

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.301
AND TIDES WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:17.270
HOW HIGH THE THE SEAS WILL RISE

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:18.605
AND WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.706
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT IT'S

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.007
INEVITABLE THAT WE WILL AND

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.676
ALREADY ARE SEEING SOME CHANGES --

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:24.978
THERE SOME RANGES HERE IN THE

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.846
HAND OUT FOR THE COAST BELOW

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.448
MENDOCINO FROM THE RECENT STATE

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.917
GUIDANCE OF SOME ESTIMATES OF

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.585
WHAT THOSE PROJECTIONS ARE OVER

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:36.523
THE COMING DECADES -- I THINK

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:37.857
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:39.959
HOWEVER MUCH THE ACTUAL SEE RISE

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:42.629
THE IT RISES THE IMPLICATIONS

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:43.730
FOR THE COAST ARE MUCH HIGHER

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.164
FROM SOME OF THE EPISODE

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.533
EPISODIC EVENTS THAT HAPPENED

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.203
WHEN KING TIDES AND LARGE STORM

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.638
SURGES COMBINED WITH THOSE.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.172
LARGER TIED SO THAT SOMETHING

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.974
ELSE TO BE PREPARED FOR

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.242
OBVIOUSLY THIS WILL AFFECT

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.511
PROPERTY INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.046
OUR NATURAL RESOURCES OUR

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:04.651
BEACHES AND OUR HABITATS.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:05.919
BOB SO THERE ARE NO NUMEROUS

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:06.586
STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE ALREADY

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:08.421
WORKING ON TRYING TO ADDRESS

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:09.255
SOME OF THESE ISSUES SOME OF

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.957
THEM ARE HERE TO TESTIFY BEFORE

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.859

THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER BUT

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:16.229
THEY ALSO EACH HAVE SOMEWHAT

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.864
UNIQUE ROLES THE COASTAL

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.099
COMMISSION -- REGULATES THE USE

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.367
OF LAND AND WATER IN THE COASTAL

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:22.869
ZONE WHICH GENERALLY EXTENDS

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:24.203
INTO ABOUT A THOUSAND YARDS

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.539
INLAND FROM THE MEAN HIGH TIDE.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.407
I'M A LOT OF THAT IS THROUGH

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:28.908
THEIR LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:31.411
REGULATORY PROCESS THE LCP WHICH

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:33.446
I KNOW YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT FROM

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:34.981
THEM HERE TODAY -- BUT THEY ARE

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.283
NOT IN CHARGE OF REGULATING IN

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.319
THE SIMS IS THE BAY AREA THAT IS

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:40.453
THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.788
CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:44.090
COMMISSION OR BC DC ALSO HERE

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:49.562
REGULATORY ISSUES AROUND THE SAN

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.431
FRANCISCO BAY -- STATE COASTAL

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:54.033
CONSERVANCY TYPICALLY DOES MORE

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.368
OF A HANDS ON PROJECTS WHERE

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:56.603
BECAUSE THE COMMISSION A. B. C.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.904
DC KIND OF WORK ON PLANNING

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.138
GENERALLY ALTHOUGH THEY DO SOME

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:00.673
PROJECTS TO COASTAL CONSERVANCY

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.275
IS REALLY FOCUSED ON GIVING OUT

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.977
GRANTS AND IN SOME CASES ALSO

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.411
UNDERTAKING DIRECTLY SOME OF

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:07.480
THOSE PROJECTS -- ALONG THE

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.449
COAST AND IN THE BAY THEY'VE GOT

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:11.584
BOTH JURISDICTIONS OPC THE OCEAN

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.152
PROTECTION COUNCIL PLAYS A MOAT

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.854
MOST IF COORDINATING ROLE ACROSS

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.022
ALL OF THESE AGENCIES AT THE

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.624

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:23.229
GUIDANCE -- AND THEN ALSO SOME

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:24.330
LOCAL PROJECTS.

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:25.498
AND THEN FINALLY THE STATE LANDS

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:27.734
COMMISSION IS OUR LANDLORD FOR

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.668
THE STATE OWNED SOVEREIGN

THAILAND'S AND SUBMERGED LANDS

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.041
AND SO THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE A

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.409
ROLE TO PLAY TO PROTECT STATE

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:37.877
INTERESTS THEY'RE NOT LISTED

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.278

SAY THAT THE CATEGORIES THIS IS

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:14.614
RELATIVELY MODEST IT'S KIND OF

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:16.182
BEEN IN THE LOW MILLIONS OVER

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.117

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:37.930
OBVIOUSLY THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:39.398
THE STATE JUST WASHES ITS HANDS

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:40.833
AND WALKS AWAY THERE'S A VERY

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.769
LARGE STATE INTEREST IN ENSURING

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:44.570
THAT THERE'S PREPARATION -- AN

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:45.938
ADAPTATION HAPPENING AT THE

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:48.708
LOCAL LEVEL BOTH FOR HEALTH AND

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:49.909
SAFETY CONCERNS.

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:51.911
AND POTENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:53.379
BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE AS THE STATE

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.148
ALSO OWN PROPERTY ALONG THE

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:56.749
COAST INCLUDING HIGHWAYS AND

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:58.351
BEACHES THAT WILL NEED

00:06:58.417 --> 00:07:00.119
PROTECTION AND WE ARE THE PUBLIC.

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:02.989
TRUST ENTITY AS THE STATE FOR

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:03.990
NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.491
SO WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:07.093
PROPOSAL CERTAINLY REASONABLE

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.628
AND AND MEET SOME IMPORTANT

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:10.129
NEEDS -- BUT I THINK ONE OF THE

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:12.331
MAIN MESSAGES WE WANTED TO LEAVE

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:13.900
YOU WITH TODAY IS THAT THIS.

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:16.035
LIKELY JUST A STARTING PLACE --

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.104
OVER THE COMING YEARS AND THAT --

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:19.138
THERE'S STILL.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.740
A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE FOR

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.041
PREPARATION AND THAT LOCAL

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.576
COMMUNITIES ARE GONNA NEED STATE

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:25.444
ASSISTANCE BOTH PROBABLY

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:28.314
FINANCIAL BUT ALSO -- POLICY

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:31.717
GUIDANCE AND ADDITIONAL TOOLS.

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:33.753
SO ON THAT NOTE TURNING TO THE

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.288
FINAL PAGE OF THE HANDOUT AND

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:37.590
THIS IS ALSO A PAGE THIRTEEN AND

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:39.091
FOURTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA -- SOME

00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:41.294
OF THE KEY LEGISLATIVE QUESTIONS

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.229
WE WOULD RECOMMEND YOU START

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.096
GRAPPLING WITH.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:45.798
I'M NOT JUST TODAY OF COURSE BUT

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:48.034
IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.302
AND THE FIRST ONE WE THINK IS

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:51.204
REALLY KEY WHICH IS TRYING TO

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.805
FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE WAY THAT

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:54.540
THE STATE CAN AND SHOULD BE MOST

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:55.842
HELPFUL AND WHAT IS.

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:57.410
THE LOCAL ROLL KIND OF FIGURING

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:58.511
OUT THOSE ROLES AND

00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:00.112
RESPONSIBILITIES AND MAKING SURE

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:02.081
THAT THE STATE IS ENGAGING IN

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:05.184
LEVERAGING -- ITS RESOURCES AND

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:09.155
ASSISTANCE IN THE MOST HELPFUL

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:10.957
WAY POSSIBLE -- SECOND WHAT KIND

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:11.624
OF PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AT THE

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:13.926
LOCAL LEVEL IS IT SUFFICIENT --

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.228
IT ARE THERE OTHER THINGS THE

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:16.529
STATE CAN DO EITHER THROUGH

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:18.130
CARROTS OR THROUGH STICKS TO

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:19.365
HELP AT THE LOCAL LEVEL MAKE

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:20.900
SURE THAT THE PROGRESS IS BEING

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:22.568
MADE.

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.437
FUNDING WITH THE LIMITED

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:25.705
RESOURCES WE HAVE BOTH AT THE

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:27.106
STATE LEVEL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.774
HOW CAN WE TARGET IT MOST

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:30.710
EFFECTIVELY -- AND ARE THERE

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:32.144
OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THAT MIGHT

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:33.646
BE AVAILABLE OR BE MADE

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:35.648
AVAILABLE THROUGH -- TOOLS THAT

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:37.216
AREN'T BEING UTILIZED YET THAT

00:08:37.283 --> 00:08:39.185
THAT MAYBE REQUIRES LEGISLATIVE

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:40.453
ACTION.

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:43.356
TO ENABLE. ONE OF THE ROLES WAYS

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.490
THE STATE HAS BEEN MOST HELPFUL

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.225
I THINK SO FAR AND CAN CONTINUE

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:47.560
TO BE HELPFUL IS PROVIDING DATA

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:49.228
AND DOING RESEARCH ON A

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:50.496
STATEWIDE BASIS.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:51.898
THROUGH KIND OF MEANS OF SCALE

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:53.499
TO PROVIDE TO LOCAL LEVEL SO

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:54.700
CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:56.769
ENGAGED IN THAT ROLE AND ALSO

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:59.205
CONTINUING TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:00.773
REFLECTING UPDATED SCIENTIFIC

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.942
UNDERSTANDINGS AS THINGS CHANGE

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:05.645
AND PROVIDING THAT GUIDANCE AT

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:07.280
THE LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL -- FOR

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:08.714
STATE ASSETS SOME OF THESE

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:10.416
PROPERTY INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS

00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:11.951
ARE THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:15.321
AND ARE WE ENGAGING AND TAKING

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.023
ACTION THAT WE NEED TO PUT TO DO

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:19.225
TO PROTECT OUR ASSETS INCLUDING

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:21.227
HIGHWAYS BUILDINGS AND BEACHES

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:23.296
AND HOW IS THAT BEING COR NEEDED.

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:24.530
WHAT ARE THE COST ESTIMATES AND

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:26.699
HAVE THE FUNDING BEEN PROVIDED

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:27.934
FOR FOR THOSE STATE

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.702
RESPONSIBILITIES?

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:31.804
AND THEN FINALLY ON THE L. C. P.

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:33.205
OUR LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAMS THAT

00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:35.474
ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE COASTAL

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:36.876
COMMISSION THAT IS HAS BEEN

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:38.144
TRADITIONALLY ONE OF THE PRIMARY

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.412
WAYS THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:42.114
ENGAGED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.549
IN A LOT OF THESE COASTAL

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:45.651
DEVELOPMENT AN ADAPTATION

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:47.787
DECISIONS AND ACTIONS SO

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:49.522
CONTINUING TO MONITOR HOW THAT

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:51.290
PROCESS IS WORKING -- IS

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:52.725
EFFECTIVE IS IT THE BEST

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:53.859
CONTINUE TO BE THE BEST WAY AND

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.227
HOW CAN WE MAKE IT MORE

00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:58.664
EFFECTIVE -- IT IN TERMS OF THAT

00:09:58.731 --> 00:09:59.732
STATE AND LOCAL NEXUS.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:00.967
AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO CLOSE

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:02.001
BY SAYING THIS IS ACTUALLY AN

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:03.869
AREA THAT OUR OFFICE WOULD LIKE

00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:05.271
TO BE INCREASINGLY ENGAGING IN

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:06.639
THIS THINKING ABOUT A LOT AND IS

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:07.606
PLANNING TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:08.908

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:52.251
CHALLENGES WITH WITH MONEY THIS

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.407
SO WE GOT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:16.542
MILLION IN TRAINING AND THREE

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:18.544

HELP ME OUT ON THAT.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.915
THE FIRST PART ON THERE.

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:25.484
ON THE YEAH I I THINK I'LL DEFER

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:26.385
TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:27.853
JUSTIFICATION I WILL JUST

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.789
HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS IS.

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:30.489
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:11:30.556 --> 00:11:32.358
HAS USED TO TERRA FOR IN RECENT

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:34.293
YEARS THESE ADAPTATION ACTIVITY

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.530
SO IT'S NOT A NEW USE OF THESE

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:38.064
FUNDS FOR THESE TYPES OF

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.265
ACTIVITIES.

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:41.967
I THINK HE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:44.336
VERY -- FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE

00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:46.005
THAT WE DRAW THOSE LINES JUST

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:49.241
TRYING TO SET AN EXAMPLE THAT WE

00:11:49.308 --> 00:11:51.544
WOULD CONTINUE AT LEAST.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.745
IN THE COMING YEARS [inaudible]

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:55.681
M..

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:58.284
TALK ABOUT THE OVERLAP --

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.986
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEA LEVEL RISE

00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:02.455
YOU DO YOU DO YOU FOCUSED ON THE

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:03.823
STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN A LOCAL

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:05.591
RESPONSIBLE IN TRYING TO SORT

00:12:05.658 --> 00:12:07.093
THAT OUT IN WHETHER WE MAKE

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:09.328
GRANTS AVAILABLE OR WE HAVE.

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:10.663
THE ASSISTANCE THAT WE'RE DOING

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:12.631
NOW IF ON THE RESEARCH AND DATA

00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:14.433
DATA -- I THINK SOME OF THE

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.535
LINES ARE FUZZY AND I THINK SOME

00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:18.204
OF THAT IS THE ACTIVITY THAT

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.805
COMES BECAUSE WE HAVE STORM

00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:22.975
SURGES THAT MAY HAVE A FLOODING.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:25.644
IMPACT THAT DOESN'T FIT INTO THE

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:28.347
LITTLE ADAPTATION OR CLIMATE SEA

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:31.417
LEVEL RISE BOX BUT STILL.

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:32.852
PART OF THE PHENOMENA.

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:35.454
I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:37.022
TO TO MAKE THE STATE AND LOCAL

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:38.991
GOVERNMENTS MOST SUCCESSFUL IS

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:40.860
TO ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE THOSE

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:43.395
TYPES OF FLOODING FROM SOURCE

00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:45.764
STORM SURGES ARE NOT -- CAN'T BE

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:47.366
THOUGHT OF AS SURPRISE

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:48.901
UNPREDICTABLE ANYMORE WE HAVE WE

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:49.902
HAVE TO PROTECT THEM WE HAVE TO

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:51.103
KNOW THAT THEY'RE COMING THERE'S

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.371
SOME REALLY GOOD RESEARCH

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.507
HAPPENING OUT OF SCRIPTS -- BE

00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:56.442
IT YEAH YOU SEE SAN DIEGO IN THE

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:59.612
IMPERIAL BEACH AREA OF SAN DIEGO

00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:00.179
THEY'VE GOT.

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:01.280
IN THERE USING BOOTIES AND

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:03.215
DROWNS TO TRY AND PREDICT --

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:05.317
SOME OF THE WIND THIS STORM

00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:06.819
SURGE WILL COME AND WEAR IT LIKE

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:08.120
A FEW DAYS OUT SO THAT THEY CAN

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:09.722
BE PREPARED AND KNOW EXACTLY

00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:11.690
WHERE THAT'S COMING.

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:12.658
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT --

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:14.026
COULD COULD BE A PILOT PROJECT

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:16.128
THAT PERHAPS COULD BE EMPLOYED

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:17.363
ELSEWHERE -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:18.531
NOT VERY COSTLY BECAUSE WE'VE

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:19.832
GOT A LOT OF THE MOVIES OUT

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:20.866
THERE SO IT'S JUST AT AND

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.134
PLAYING SOME ADDITIONAL DATA

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:25.971
COLLECTION TO LOOK AT AT WHEN

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:27.673
THERE'S A STORM PREDICTED WE

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.175
KNOW WHERE THE SEAS ARE WE KNOW

00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:29.808
WHAT THE TIDES ARE WHERE IS THAT

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:30.676
WATER.

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:31.744
IN A CALM SO THAT COMMUNITIES

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.180
CAN GET SAND BAGS IN PLACE OR IF

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:34.947
THEY'RE DOING LONGER TERM

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:36.282
PROJECTS PRIORITIZE THIS IS

00:13:36.348 --> 00:13:37.349
WHERE THE FLOODING IS GONNA

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:38.851
CONTINUALLY HAPPEN MAYBE

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:39.785
EPISODICALLY.

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:41.020
BUT IT WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:42.688
THERE SO THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:45.124
FOCUS OUR PRIORITIES FIRST NOW

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:47.426
AS FAR AS TIMING IS CONCERNED

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.328
IT'S AS IF WE HAVE THESE PILOTS

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:51.330
OR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:58.337
THAT THAT ARE READY TO BUY THE

00:13:58.404 --> 00:13:59.104
CALL SHOVEL READY TO READY TO GO

00:13:59.171 --> 00:13:59.838
OUT.

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:00.906
PRESUMABLY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE

00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:02.508
LEARNED FRM THOSE SOME WHETHER

00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:03.709
IT WORKS OR NOT IN THEORY IT

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:04.476
WORKS IF IT WORKS OR NOT THAT

00:14:04.543 --> 00:14:05.578
WOULD BE TRANSFERABLE TO

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:06.979
DIFFERENT.

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:10.216
OUR WATER WAYS OR RIVERS THAT

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:12.251
METER THE OCEAN OR JUST --

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:13.919
WETLANDS THAT CAN BE HAD CAN BE

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:14.853
INUNDATED RIGHT AND I WOULD SAY

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.590
THAT'S PROBABLY A PERFECT NEXUS

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:18.457
TO YOUR QUESTION OF WHAT'S THE

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:19.725
STATE ROLE LOCAL ROLE EEN IF

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:20.926
IT'S A PROJECT THAT.

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:22.494
REALLY BENEFITS THE LOCALS THE

00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:23.996
STATE COULD PUT THE FUNDING AND

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:25.531
FOR SOME OF THESE PILOT PROJECTS

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:26.432
THAT COULD THEN.

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:28.167
SHOW A STATEWIDE BENEFIT BECAUSE

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:30.102
THEY COULD BE -- LEARN FROM AND

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:32.104
THEN UTILIZED EMPLOYED IN OTHER

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:33.672
AREAS FOR SOME I'M INTERESTED IN

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:36.208
THE IN THE BUDGET REQUEST FROM

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:38.811
BC DC THERE'S NO REQUEST FOR

00:14:38.877 --> 00:14:41.347
GRANT FUNDS TO SORT OF HELP WITH

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:42.014
THESE.

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:44.250
PILOT OR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:45.751
IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY THEY'RE

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:47.353
HELPING WITH THE ASSISTING THE

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:49.989
LOCALS THAT COMPETENT PLANS AND

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:54.159
AND DO IT WHERE THE DAYS --

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:55.394
COASTAL COMMISSION HAS ABOUT

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:56.028
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN

00:14:56.095 --> 00:14:56.929
IN GRANTS THAT THERE COULD BE

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:58.964
GIVING OUT IS THERE SOME REASON

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:00.532
THE THE THINK THAT THERE'S

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:02.001
SOMETHING IS GOING ON IN THE

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:04.603
OCEAN -- WETLAND -- AREAS IT'S

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.405
NOT HAPPEN IN THE BAY I MEAN I

00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:07.539
WOULD SAY THAT I WOULD I WILL

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:09.008
ACTUALLY CHARACTERIZE THE

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:10.576
COASTAL COMMISSION MANY AS

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.211
PLANNING MANY AS WELL BOTH OF

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:13.579
THESE POTS I THINK ARE REALLY

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:14.680
PLANNING MONEY BECAUSE EVEN THE

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:15.414
GRANTS THAT THE COASTAL

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:17.549
COMMISSION WOULD GIVE THE SEVEN

00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:18.183
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.952
IS FOR PLANNING VULNERABILITY

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:21.186
ASSESSMENTS CHANGES TO THEIR

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:23.289
LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM SO IT'S

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:24.857
NOT ACTUALLY FOR PROJECTS IT'S

00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:26.592
TO PLAN FOR THE PROJECTS AND I

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:28.060
THINK THAT'S THE CASE. FOR BE

00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:30.462
CDC AS WELL -- AS A MAN AS I

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:32.197
NOTED MOST OF THE MONEY

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:33.832
TYPICALLY THAT IS GIVEN FOR

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.601
PROJECTS COMES OUT OF THE

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:38.637
COASTAL CONSERVANCY -- AND PC

00:15:38.704 --> 00:15:39.872
SOME TO BAY AREA AND AGAIN

00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:41.540
THAT'S MY LAST QUESTION IS THAT

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:42.808
IS THAT THAT.

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:45.744
THAT DANCE BETWEEN LOCAL AGENCY

00:15:45.811 --> 00:15:47.379
SAYING WE HAVE A PROJECT WE

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:51.383
THINK IT'S GOING TO REDUCE THE

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.818
LEVEL [inaudible]

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:55.587
RIGHT.

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:57.589
OR RISING IN OUR IMPACTS IMPACT

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.325
RIGHT AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BC

00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:00.392
DC THAT'S HELPING THEM WITH THE

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:01.894
OR HAS SOME INFORMATION WITH

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.594
THEM THE STATE.

00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:05.030
ALSO COMMISSION WOULD BE THE

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:06.999
VEHICLE THAT WE WOULD USE IF

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:08.767
WE'RE INTERESTED IN.

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:13.706
GRANT FUNDING GRANTS IS THAT HI.

00:16:13.772 --> 00:16:14.606
AND TYPICALLY IT'S THE

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:17.609
CONSERVANCY THE SERVICE THURMOND

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:18.944
GRANT YES THAT'S RIGHT.

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:19.478
RIGHT THESE TWO AGENCIES

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:21.880
TYPICALLY ARE MORE ENGAGED IN.

00:16:21.947 --> 00:16:22.448
PLANNING THEY DO.

00:16:22.514 --> 00:16:23.415
AND AND HAVE HISTORY OF GIVING

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:24.883
GRANTS FOR PROJECTS AS WELL AND

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.151
THEY ALL DO WORK TOGETHER BUT

00:16:26.218 --> 00:16:27.519
I'M KIND OF IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:28.554

WOULD SAY THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:30.923
THE BROAD STROKES OF ALL THOSE

00:16:30.989 --> 00:16:33.692
HYDROLOGISTS HANG OUT TOGETHER.

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.427
CENTER MCGUIRE.

LOOK.

00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:48.140
AT THE COAST MACHINE HAS A

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:48.707
WONDERFUL PROGRAM THAT WERE

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:49.375
THERE THEY'RE OFFERING GRANTS TO

00:16:49.441 --> 00:16:50.843
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO

AT THE END.

00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:01.320
WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEED IN

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:02.721
THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:04.089
DOLLARS OF INFRASTRUCTURE JUST

00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:05.724
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE THERE ON

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:08.160
OUR COASTLINES -- WHAT IS THAT

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:13.031
LONG TERM PLAN -- AND TO BE ABLE.

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:14.566
TO SAY IF WE'RE GONNA SAY TO

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:15.801
LOCALS THAT THEY HAVE TO BECOME

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.069
MORE RESILIENT.

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:17.836
IT'S GONNA BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:19.371
LOCALS BE ABLE GENERATE THE

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:20.472
REVENUE TO BE ABLE.

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:21.640
TO FORTIFY THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:23.108
OR TO BE ABLE TO CANDIDLY MOVE

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:24.643
BACK IS WELL.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.245
SO.

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:27.479
BOTTOM LINE IS I THINK.

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:29.915
A GRAND VISION OF WHAT THIS IS

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:31.283
GOING TO LOOK LIKE BOTH.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.018
WHAT OUR GOALS ARE AND HOW WE'RE

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:34.319
GONNA FUND NAME?

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:37.122
IN ALSO REALIZE IN AND AGAIN

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:38.724
THIS IS NOT THROWING STONES THE

00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:39.892
CALLS WHICH IS A OF THE ONES

00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.493
THAT ARE OUT THERE DOING IT --

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.829
IN TRYING TO FIND BUT IT IS SO

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:46.498
MINOR IN THE BIG SCHEME OF THE

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:48.467
ISSUE THAT'S CAN IMPACT IS OVER

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:49.668
THE NEXT TWO DECADES.

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:50.702
ALL THIS USE MARIN COUNTY IS

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:59.044
EXAMPLE WE HAVE AREAS IN -- NO

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:00.879
VALLEY THAT ENDED IN TIMBER ON

00:18:00.946 --> 00:18:02.347
THE CURRENTLY FLIGHT NOW.

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:04.516

THAT CONNECTS TOWARD THE SOUTH A

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:21.800
SALE THAT IS -- HOPEFULLY IN MAY

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:22.634
IN THIS WOULD BE THROUGH CHAIR

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:24.336
MAYBE IN THE IN THE FALL OF

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:25.430
UNDERSTAND AND SO I MEAN GETTING

00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:27.099
PLANNING DOLLARS COMING YES.

00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:30.335
BUT CAPITALIST PLAN I MEAN I I I

00:19:30.402 --> 00:19:33.338
KEEP WHEN WE BROUGHT THE SEVEN

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:33.972
IF YOU HEARINGS WITH LA -- SORT

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:35.941
OF QUANTIFY THE SCOPE OF THE

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:37.209
TOTAL RISK.

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.544
COMPREHENSIVELY THE STATE OF

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.078
CALIFORNIA IN A FISCALLY

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:41.380
ORIENTED WAY LOOKING AT THAT

00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:42.915
FIFTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT TO

00:19:42.981 --> 00:19:44.416
REALLY.

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:46.184
GO BEYOND SCIENCE INSERTED

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:47.519
IMPACTS WRIT LARGE DOWN TO LIKE

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:50.656
DOLLARS.

00:19:50.722 --> 00:19:52.791
WE START TO RIGHT SIZE THE THE

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.626
SCOPE OF NEED THAT RIGHT AND SO

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:56.528
WHAT I WONDER IF YOU ALL AS YOU

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:57.896
CONTINUE FALL THIS ALSO IS.

00:19:57.963 --> 00:19:59.831
IS THERE SOME METRIC WE CAN BE

00:19:59.898 --> 00:20:02.668
USING. TO TO TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:05.337
RISK WE WERE BUYING DOWN WHEN WE

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:07.372
AND MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS.

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.308
THAT IT'S IT'S A IT MIGHT SET

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:10.475
MORE CONTEXT IN THIS FEELING

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:11.543
LIKE -- THIS ISN'T AN

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:12.778
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMME YOU'RE

00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:14.179
JUST SPENDING ON LIKE FEEL GOOD

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:16.214
PROJECTS ON THE COAST LINE AND

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:17.749
YEA THE BEACH.

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:19.151
LIKE NO ACTUALLY WE'RE TRYING TO

00:20:19.217 --> 00:20:20.719
SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HERE

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:22.621
YEAH AND AND SO.

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:24.423
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT.

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:25.791
IT'S GOING TO BE ROUGH.

00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:27.159
THE MATH I I WOULD IMAGINE

00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:28.260
THERE'S SOMEWHAT SOME

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:30.262
SENSITIVITY IN IT BUT WE DO THIS

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:34.366
IN ACTUAR REALLY ANALYSES ARE.

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:35.133
IN THIS WHAT REINSURANCE

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.703
COMPANIES DO CONSTANTLY RIGHT SO

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:38.737
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU GUYS WANT

00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:40.439
TO CONSIDER YES AND WE ARE AND

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:41.873
WHAT YOU VESTED GOOD QUESTIONS

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.342
THAT WE PROBABLY HAVEN'T HAD

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:43.976
SATISFACTORY ANSWERS TO IN

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:45.010
SEVERAL HEARINGS AND SO WE ARE

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.212
GRAPPLING WITH ITS IT IS AND AND

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:47.846
AND TAKING.

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:49.414
IT SERIOUSLY AND HOPING TO SPEND

00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:50.682
SOMETIME OVR THE SUMMER AND

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:52.951
FALL I MEAN I THINK I WILL ONE

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:54.219
CONTEXT I WILL ADD IS.

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:56.588
IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE AND

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:57.823
MAKE SURE THAT OUR DOLLARS ARE.

00:20:57.889 --> 00:20:59.157
ACTUALLY BUYING DOWN RISK THERE

00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:01.460
IS A PROCESS THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:21:01.526 --> 00:21:03.862
GONE THROUGH FIRST OF WHAT ARE

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:04.696
THE VULNERABILITIES IN DOING THE

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:06.365
AVAILABILITY ASSESSMENT AND THEN

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.432
THE PLANNING FOR HOW DO YOU

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:08.734
ADDRESS THAT AND THEN UNDERTAKEN

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.202
THE PROJECT SO IN SOME WAYS IT'S

00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:12.070
GOOD THAT WE HAVEN'T SPENT

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:12.337
BILLIONS.

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:14.473
IN PROJECTS YET WHEN WE ARE

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:15.974
STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DOING

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.810
THE PHONE ABILITY ASSESSMENTS

00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:20.812
AND PLANNING I THINK. ONE OF OUR

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:21.546
MESSAGES AND I'M SURE YOU'LL

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.915
HEAR THIS FROM FROM THE AGENCIES

00:21:23.982 --> 00:21:26.952
AS WELL AS WE'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:28.120
THAT PLANNING DONE THAT'S GREAT

00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:29.454
WE NEED TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:30.956
PHASE AND FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:32.057
ENGAGE MEANINGFULLY IN THE

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:32.924
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS AND

00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:33.659
PLANNING.

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:35.193
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.329
WE'RE HELPING THEM DO THAT AND

00:21:37.396 --> 00:21:40.165
AND TO TO SHOUT OUT THE CHAIRS

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:42.401
LEGISLATION HERE I MEAN THE THE

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:44.703
EFFICACY OF ADDING MORE FIRE

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.271
POWER IN?

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:47.572
TWO NOT JUST THE CONSERVANCY BUT

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:49.708
ALSO IT -- PR IN THOSE DOING THE

00:21:49.775 --> 00:21:51.343
FIFTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT AND

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.411
FIND A WAY TO GET SOME OF THIS

00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:55.113
STUFF COORDINATED IN A WAY THAT --

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.648
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CAPACITY FOR

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:57.816
THIS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY THEY

00:21:57.883 --> 00:21:59.451
CAN'T DO IT ON THEIR OWN RIGHT

00:21:59.518 --> 00:22:01.486
SO LIKE HOW TO BUILD THAT INDEED

00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:03.355
THE SEQUEL -- GENERAL PLAN

00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:04.523
UPDATES AGAIN A REALLY.

00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:06.658
EASY TURN KEY WAY YOU GOT OFF

00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:08.360
THE SHELF GOOD SOLID PEER

00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:09.895
REVIEWED STUDIES COMING OUT.

00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:11.930
SO ANY OUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:13.065
LINING WITH WHERE YOUR GUYS HAS

00:22:13.131 --> 00:22:14.299
A YEAH AND I THINK ONE OF THE

00:22:14.366 --> 00:22:15.667
THINGS WE'D REALLY LIKE TO LOOK

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:17.135
AT MORE CLOSELY AS IF THERE ARE

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:18.470
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:19.905
KIND OF FOR THEIR HAD WHAT IS

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:21.373
ENABLING THEM TO GET FURTHER

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:21.707
AHEAD.

00:22:21.773 --> 00:22:23.408
WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS AND THEN

00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:23.975
IF THERE ARE THOSE THAT ARE

00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:25.110
STRONGLY MORE WHAT ARE THE

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.779
BARRIERS AND AND WHAT CAN WE

00:22:27.846 --> 00:22:28.280
LEARN FROM THAT KIND OF

00:22:28.346 --> 00:22:29.147
STATEWIDE LEVEL?

00:22:29.214 --> 00:22:30.515
I GUESS THE QUESTION COMES ON

00:22:30.582 --> 00:22:36.822
THESE HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT IS

00:22:36.888 --> 00:22:38.490
A I THINK YOU COULD MAKE A CASE.

00:22:38.557 --> 00:22:39.124
AND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.059
SAN FRANCISCO I WAS BORN THERE

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:41.727
SO I CAN SAY THAT THEY THEY HAVE.

00:22:41.793 --> 00:22:44.362
A BIG VOICE ABOUT WHAT THEY

00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:45.197
WANTED TO TAKE.

00:22:45.263 --> 00:22:46.998
TO AS ADDRESS SEALEVEL RISE AND

00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:47.766
THAT'S TO BUILD BARRIERS AROUND

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:50.135
THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT THAT DOES

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:50.936
NOT HELP OUT MARIN.

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:52.771
ALAMEDA COUNTY SANTA CLARA

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:54.539
COUNTY SAN MATEO COUNTY SO THERE

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:56.141
THEY WERE WELL DEVELOPED BUT

00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:58.443
THAT'S I WOULD ARGUE THAT'S A

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.745
LOCAL ISSUE THAT IS.

00:22:59.811 --> 00:23:04.182
HORRIBLE SELF INTEREST HORRIBLE.

00:23:04.249 --> 00:23:06.885
STEPPED VERSUS THE WORK ON

00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:09.488
ALAMEDA CREEK TO CREATE -- RE

HAVE RE HYDRATES OR RECONSTITUTE

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.059
TO REVERSES THAT THAT YOU

00:23:14.126 --> 00:23:15.861
INCREASE THE WETLAND --

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:17.996
THROUGHOUT THE BAY IT'S COST THE

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:19.364
SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AND YOU

00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:21.967
REDUCE SEA LEVEL RISING IN.

00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:22.968
MARIN.

00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:26.805

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:40.619
VERSUS SOMEBODY FROM SAN LEANDRO

00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:41.720
COMING IN HERE AND SAYING BUT

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:43.388
THE HYDROLOGY WILL WORK OUT SO

00:23:43.455 --> 00:23:45.824
THAT WE ALL BENEFITS SO THAT'S

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:47.425
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED THE HELP

00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:49.261
FROM THE ALEJO.

00:23:49.327 --> 00:23:50.896
AND ALSO FOR MáS IS TO IS TO

00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:52.097
LOOK AT THESE.

00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:53.465
THESE ARE.

00:23:53.532 --> 00:23:56.067
POTENTIALLY POOR QUIET.

00:23:56.134 --> 00:23:58.270
YES THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO DO IT

00:23:58.336 --> 00:24:00.438
THAT WOULD BENEFIT EVERYBODY IN

00:24:00.505 --> 00:24:01.840
THAT GOES REGION REGION WHETHER

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:03.708
YOU'RE IN SAN DIEGO OR YOU'RE IN

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:06.144
THE CENTRAL COAST YOU SAY WE GOT

00:24:06.211 --> 00:24:07.379
A LOT OF BIG MOUTHS OF HAVE AN

00:24:07.445 --> 00:24:07.879
IDEA.

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:10.282
BUT IT'S NOT THE BEST IDEA TO

00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:12.651
GETS THE BEST POP BEST BEING

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:19.691
BEST GOOD FOR THE REGION.

00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:21.026
IN THIS ADAPTATION.

00:24:21.092 --> 00:24:21.760
I THINK YOU'LL HEAR QUITE A BIT

00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:22.994
FROM THE CDC ABOUT THAT ISSUE IN

00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:24.329

THE IN THE BAY.

00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:27.833
SPECIFICALLY OF REGIONAL

00:24:27.899 --> 00:24:29.267
APPROACH SO I'LL DEFER TO THEM

00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:30.936
BUT I I THERE THERE IS PROGRESS

00:24:31.002 --> 00:24:32.604
BEING MADE ON THAT POINT AND

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:34.105
THAT APPROACH IN THE BAY I THINK

00:24:34.172 --> 00:24:35.073
YOU'LL HEAR FROM.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.742

THERE'S NO ACTION WE'RE GOING TO

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:41.112
TAKE.

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:43.048
THEY OPEN UP.

00:24:43.114 --> 00:24:44.749

WE WILL GO.

00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:51.857
DRILL DOWN ON THE DIFFERENT

00:24:51.923 --> 00:24:56.862
AGENCIES.

00:24:56.928 --> 00:24:58.029
A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND

00:24:58.096 --> 00:24:59.631
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THINK

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:01.833
I'M THE ONLY ONE SO I MIGHT.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.635
OKAY TO TAKE MORE TIME.

00:25:03.702 --> 00:25:04.569
NO JUST OKAY I'LL BE BRIEF.

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:05.370
I JUST REALLY WANTED TO

00:25:05.437 --> 00:25:07.305
HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS --

00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:08.773
ONE OF THEM AND AND REALLY WANT

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.141
TO THINK THE LA -- FOR FRAMING

00:25:10.208 --> 00:25:11.443
THIS AS NOT JUST WERE TALKING

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:13.678
ABOUT THE A FEW MILLION DOLLARS

00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:15.680
THAT WERE PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET

00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:17.082
BUT REALLY THE HIGHLIGHT BEATEN

00:25:17.148 --> 00:25:19.985
THE DRASTIC NEED MOVING FORWARD --

00:25:20.051 --> 00:25:21.052
WHAT ONE THING I WOULD ALSO

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:22.287
MENTION IS THAT THERE HASN'T

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:23.688
BEEN A WHOLE LOT OF DISCUSSION

00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:24.723
ABOUT THE THE ROLE THE

00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:25.657
DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND

00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:27.592
RECREATION PLACE IN ALL THIS --

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:28.627
I THINK AS LAND OWNERS OF ONE

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:31.863
THIRD THE COASTLINE INC IN

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:32.464
CALIFORNIA THEY WILL BE A PART

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.433
OF THE SO IT AS DISCUSSIONS

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.668
AROUND FUNDING IN A ADDITIONAL

00:25:36.735 --> 00:25:38.069
RESOURCES BEING MADE AVAILABLE

00:25:38.136 --> 00:25:39.771
FOR THESE ISSUES -- THEY SHOULD

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:41.673
DEFINITELY BE THE TABLE -- ALSO

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.275
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT -- THERE WAS

00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:45.977
MENTION OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION.

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:47.045
ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE OF SOMEONE

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:48.780
STONE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING

00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:52.083
WITH AUTUMN ON CALIFORNIA ON

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.752
OZELL TO LOOK AT EXISTING

00:25:53.818 --> 00:25:55.153
REVENUES FROM THE TIDE LINES.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.389
ACCOUNT -- WHICH HAS A DIRECT

00:25:57.455 --> 00:26:00.091
NEXUS AS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE TO

00:26:00.158 --> 00:26:01.259
TO SEA LEVEL RISE IN COST LETTER

00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:03.128
TATIAN GIVEN THAT WE ARE PUMPING

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:05.830
ALL THIS OIL FROM OUR OFFSHORE.

00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:07.399
OIL WELLS IN STATE WATERS -- AND

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:08.934
WE GET SOME REVENUE BUT THERE

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:09.734
REALLY HASN'T BEEN AN

00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:11.403
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THAT REVENUE

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:13.038
AND DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:15.407
PROJECTS -- AT LEAST NOT IN THE

00:26:15.473 --> 00:26:16.274
LAST DECADE OR SO.

00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:17.475
ALSO BEING ABLE TO GO BACK TO

00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:19.077
AND TO RE LINK AND CREATE THAT

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:20.045
NEXUS I THINK IT'S AN

00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:21.246
APPROPRIATE AND VERY IMPORTANT

00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:22.714
STEP IN OR TO ENSURE THAT

00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:23.248
THERE'S ADDITIONAL FUNDING

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:24.015
MOVING FORWARD.

00:26:24.082 --> 00:26:25.083
THE LAST THING I WOULD MENTION

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.118
IS IS AROUND -- NEEDING TO

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:28.520
REALLY EMPHASIZE NATURAL

00:26:28.586 --> 00:26:29.921
INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS --

00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:31.790
MOVING FORWARD -- FROM THE

00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:36.394
PERSPECTIVE OF EVEN COASTAL

00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:36.995
ACCESS IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:26:37.062 --> 00:26:37.462
PIECE.

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:38.096
AND THEN THE PUZZLE BECAUSE WE

00:26:38.163 --> 00:26:39.597
KNOW THAT RELYING HEAVILY ON

00:26:39.664 --> 00:26:41.700
RIPRAP IN ANOTHER -- HARD AGREE

00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:43.535
INFRASTRUCTURES A SEQUELS DOES

00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:45.837
HAVE -- DIRECT IMPACTS TO

00:26:45.904 --> 00:26:47.405
ADJACENT BEACHES DOWN THE LINE --

00:26:47.472 --> 00:26:48.907
WHICH FURTHER REDUCES THAN THE

00:26:48.974 --> 00:26:50.709
AMOUNT OF BEACH SANDY BEACHES

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:52.410
THAT WE'D HAVE ACCESSIBLE TO US

00:26:52.477 --> 00:26:54.245
AS CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS -- SO ON

00:26:54.312 --> 00:26:55.847
BEHALF OF US WOULD WANT TO MAKE

00:26:55.914 --> 00:26:57.282
THOSE COMMENTS AS WELL AGAIN AND

00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:58.950
THANKS OFFER THE DISCUSSION AND

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:00.185
LOOKING FOR TO CONTINUE ENGAGE.

00:27:00.251 --> 00:27:02.020
PART WILL CLOSE AT MATTER AND

00:27:02.087 --> 00:27:03.822
LET'S CALL UP.

00:27:03.888 --> 00:27:05.590
ISSUE NUMBER.

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:06.992
TEN THIS IS GOING TO BE A JOINT

00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:08.293
CALIFORNIA COLTS THE COMMISSION

ADAPTATION AND THIS COMMITTEES

00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:37.655
INTEREST IN THIS BECAUSE IT IS A

00:27:37.722 --> 00:27:39.457
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR

00:27:39.524 --> 00:27:40.925
CALIFORNIA'S COASTLINE.

00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:42.293
AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S COAST

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:42.961
LINE.

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.963
IS FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.731
COAST IN OCEAN ECONOMY IS AT

00:27:46.798 --> 00:27:48.767
RISK FROM CLIMATE DRIVEN STILL

00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:51.236
ARISE WHICH INVOLVES FLOODING

00:27:51.302 --> 00:27:53.071
INUNDATION EROSION.

00:27:53.138 --> 00:27:54.906
AND ULTIMATELY THE LOSS OF OUR

00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:56.508
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PROPERTIES

00:27:56.574 --> 00:27:58.443
ALONG THE COAST. ONE RECENT

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.245
STUDY FOUND THAT -- WE DON'T

00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:02.147
TAKE ACTION NOW TWO THIRDS OF

00:28:02.213 --> 00:28:03.214
OUR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BEACHES

00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:04.916
ARE GOING TO BE -- GONE BY THE

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:06.384
END OF THE CENTURY.

00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:07.619
AND THAT'S REALLY THE ECONOMIC

00:28:07.685 --> 00:28:10.722
HEART AND SOUL OF A LOT OF OUR

00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:12.257
COASTAL COMMUNITIES.

00:28:12.323 --> 00:28:13.124
AND WITH EACH NEW STUDY THE GETS

00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:14.292
PUBLISHED WE LEARNED THAT THE

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:16.161
SEAS ARE RISING FASTER.

00:28:16.227 --> 00:28:17.495
AND THAT THERE WILL BE HOT THE

00:28:17.562 --> 00:28:19.330
IT WE RISING HIGHER THAN

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:20.765
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:23.802
RECENT USGS STUDY AS YOU JUST

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:25.737
MENTIONED FOUND THAT.

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:26.871
WITH THAT JUST WITH A MODEST

00:28:26.938 --> 00:28:28.907
INCREASE IN SEAL RISE IN

00:28:28.973 --> 00:28:30.708

DRIVEN CLIMATE CHANGE DRIVEN

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.945
AMPED UP STORMS COULD RESULT IN

00:28:34.012 --> 00:28:36.414
A REALLY DEVASTATING -- FIXED

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:39.250
WERE -- COASTAL COMMUNITIES.

00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:40.218
AND IT'S HAPPENING NOW IT'S NOT

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:41.586
LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE FUTURE

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:43.188
WE'RE SEEING WITH KING TIDES

00:28:43.254 --> 00:28:45.123
WITH JUST EIGHTEEN INCHES OF

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.125
RISE AND AND AND SEAL WITH THOSE

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:48.359
REFLECTING THOSE KING TIDE YOU

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:49.627

00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:51.563
COAST LINE WE'VE DOCUMENTED THAT

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:52.597
REALLY WELL THROUGH OUR KING

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:52.931

00:28:57.402 --> 00:28:59.304
IT REALLY OF INCREDIBLE IMAGERY

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:00.839
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE

00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:01.739

REGULATES AND PLANS FOR SAN

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:12.790
FRANCISCO BAY AND THEN I'M HERE

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:15.693
IT COUNTIES -- SHORELINE AS ONE

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.997
INTEGRATED UNIT AND WE ARE VERY

00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:22.100
FOCUSED ON RISING SEA LEVEL IN

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:23.634
THE IMPACTS ON THE SHORELINE I

00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:26.037
HAVE A BRIEFING PAPER THAT WAS

00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:27.438

PICTURES WELL OF YOU'VE JUST

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:36.481
HEARD THAT RISING FEEL IMPACTS

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:37.982
ALREADY HERE IN FACT THIS

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:40.918
PICTURE IS C&lt;c.cyan&gt; JUNCTION IN.&lt;/c&gt;

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:42.653
MARIN SHOWING US ANY DAY

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.188
FLOODING.

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:46.858
FROM HIGH TIDES SO THIS ISN'T A

00:33:46.924 --> 00:33:48.359
THEORY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:50.962
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING -- AND I

00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:51.863
WANT TO MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:52.864
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE POINTS HAVE

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.233
BEEN MADE BUT ON THIS PAGE HERE

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:58.436
YOU SEE A MAP THAT SHOWS -- THE

00:33:58.503 --> 00:34:00.138
VULNERABLE AREAS ALONG THE SAN

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:01.672
FRANCISCO BAY SHORELINE AS A

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:03.207
PART OF OUR PLANNING PROJECT

00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:04.242
WE'VE TRIED TO IDENTIFY THE

00:34:04.308 --> 00:34:04.976
AREAS.

00:34:05.042 --> 00:34:06.644
THAT ARE HIGHLY VULNERABLE WHICH

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:07.979
INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:11.082
COMMUNITIES -- IN -- COMMUNITIES

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:12.850
WHERE PEOPLE SPEAK ENGLISH AS A

00:34:12.917 --> 00:34:14.585
SECOND LANGUAGE AND THESE FOLKS

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:15.920
ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE.

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.121
HAVE THE LEAST ABILITY TO

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:18.790
RESPOND TO FLOODING AND OTHER

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:21.392
EMERGENCIES AND SO WE BELIEVE

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:23.027
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A HEAVY

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:24.328
FOCUS IS A ALREADY BEEN

00:34:24.395 --> 00:34:25.163
MENTIONED.

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:32.036
ON ADDRESSING THESE COMMUNITIES.

00:34:32.103 --> 00:34:33.471
THE NEXT PAGE SHOWS THE SOUTH

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:35.072
BAY AND THIS GOES TO TALK TO THE

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.974
COST.

00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:42.914
THERE IS AROUND YES -- I CAN'T

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.415
REMEMBER HOW MANY OF THE HIGH

00:34:44.482 --> 00:34:46.083
TECH COMMUNITIES BUT MOST ALL

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.385
THE MEN THERE SHOWN ON THE MAP

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:49.187
HERE ARE ALONG THE BAY SHORE

00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:50.688
LINE INCLUDING FACEBOOK.

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:52.523
AND THE GOOGLE PLAQUES WELL WHAT

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.958
WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU GOOGLE

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:55.259
SOMETHING THEY SAID SORRY WE'RE

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:56.527
FLOODING RIGHT NOW WE'LL GET

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:58.696
BACK TO YOU ON THAT -- ONE THE

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:00.231
PACIFIC INSTITUTE DID A STUDY A

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:02.667
FEW YEARS BACK THAT ESTIMATED

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.569
THE COST JUST TO REPLACE -- THE

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:06.504
BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:08.706
SUCH THAT WOULD BE -- FLOODED AT

00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:11.042
A FIVE FOOT OF SEA LEVEL RISE IS

00:35:11.108 --> 00:35:13.077
OVER SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS THAT

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:14.278
DOESN'T COST.

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:16.614
OUT THE LOST WAGES AND

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:18.749
PRODUCTIVITY SO THERE ARE VERY

00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:21.285
LARGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:24.255
ADDRESSING RISING SEA LEVEL.

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:26.390
AND NEXT PAGE SHOWS -- WHAT

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:27.892
WE'RE DOING ABOUT IT WE ARE A

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:29.393
PLANNING IN A REGULATORY AGENCY

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.696
THIS IS A PICTURE FROM THE SAN

00:35:31.762 --> 00:35:32.930
FRANCISCO SHORELINE?

00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:36.300
ON THE LEFT HERE IS THE AG

00:35:36.367 --> 00:35:38.436
BUILDING -- RIGHT BY THE FERRY

00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:40.004
BUILDING WHICH WAS BUILT MANY

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:41.038
YEARS AGO.

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:42.573
AND YOU CAN SEE THE HIGH TIDE

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.876
LINE IS VERY GETTING VERY CLOSE

00:35:44.942 --> 00:35:47.178
TO THE THE PIER -- BOTTOM ON THE

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:49.614
RIGHT IS A NEW FERRY TERMINAL

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.582
THAT IS JUST BEEN CONSTRUCTED.

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:55.086
AND THE PERMITS THAT WE GRANTED

00:35:55.152 --> 00:35:56.354
THEM REQUIRED THEM TO BE

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.323
RESILIENT TO MID CENTURY.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.025
AND TO HAVE AN ADAPTIVE

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:01.826
MANAGEMENT STRATEGY TO END OF

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.361
CENTURY WHICH IS WHAT WE REQUIRE

00:36:03.427 --> 00:36:05.696
OF ALL OUR MAJOR PROJECTS AND SO

00:36:05.763 --> 00:36:06.297
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE SO MUCH

00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:07.031
HIGHER.

00:36:07.098 --> 00:36:08.366
THAT'S SO YOU CAN SEE THE STARK

00:36:08.432 --> 00:36:09.967
DIFFERENCE THAN WHAT WE'RE

00:36:10.034 --> 00:36:11.702
LOOKING AT IN TRYING TO ADAPT.

00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:12.603
IN SAM CISCO BAY AND THIS IS

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:13.871
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:36:13.938 --> 00:36:15.873
THIS IS THE EMERGENCY WATER

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.608
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK AND SO

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:19.544
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE FLOODING

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.245
WHEN YOU NEED -- WHEN YOU HAVE

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:21.913
AN EARTHQUAKE IN YOU NEED TO GET

00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:26.017
PEOPLE -- MOVED AROUND SAN

00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:26.784
FRANCISCO BAY.

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:29.020
AB BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:36:29.086 --> 00:36:30.922
YOU CAN'T GET TO A RESILIENT

00:36:30.988 --> 00:36:32.490
REGION JUST THROUGH THE PERMIT

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:34.859
PROCESS SO WE ARE DOING A

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:37.261
REGIONAL PLANNING -- THE NEXT

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:42.166
PAGE US IS -- ATHENA STUDY AND

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:44.268
I'LL -- UP.

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:45.503
MY PARTNER HERE AND THIS STUDY

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.471
SHOW THAT THE BENEFITS FROM

00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:49.941
DOING ADVANCE MITIGATION

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:51.275
PLANNING ARE -- WE'RE SHOWN TO

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:53.477
BE MORE THAN FOUR ONE SIX TWO

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.079
ONE BENEFITS FROM DOING ADVANCE

00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:56.514
MITIGATION PLANNING.

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:57.848
AND SO THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING

00:36:57.915 --> 00:36:59.850
RIGHT NOW IN THE BAY -- RIGHT

00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:01.919
NOW WE HAVE IN ADAPTING TO

00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:04.455
RISING TIDES PROGRAM -- OR ART

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:05.957
AS WE CALL IT THAT IS DOING

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:07.658
REGIONAL PLANNING ON WORKING

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:09.694
WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- TO DO

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.928
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS AND

00:37:10.995 --> 00:37:14.765
ADAPTATION PLANNING AND OUR

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:15.866
CURRENT STUDY IS ART BAY AREA

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:18.336
WHERE WE'RE WORKING TO ADDRESS

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:20.504
THE BAIT TRANSPORTATION NETWORK

00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:22.707
INCLUDING A LOT OF STATE HIGHWAY

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:24.075
ASSETS AND LOOKING AT THEIR

00:37:24.141 --> 00:37:25.409
VULNERABILITY.

00:37:25.476 --> 00:37:27.311
AND LOOKING AT ADAPTATION

00:37:27.378 --> 00:37:30.181
MEASURES FOR THEM AS WELL AS

00:37:30.247 --> 00:37:31.515
ASSOCIATED -- PRIORITY

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:32.717
DEVELOPMENT AREAS AND

00:37:32.783 --> 00:37:36.153
CONSERVATION AREAS IN

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:36.621
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:37.655
COMMUNITIES.

00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:38.255
AND WE'RE DOING THIS WITH THE

00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:40.458
GRANT FROM CALTRANS AND THE

00:37:40.524 --> 00:37:41.993
METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:44.395
COMMISSION.

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:46.297
WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH LOCAL

00:37:46.364 --> 00:37:47.965
COMMUNITIES -- ONE WE'RE DOING

VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT AND

00:37:53.738 --> 00:37:55.940
ADAPTATION PLANNING -- WITH THEM

00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:57.408
AND THE INTERESTING THING IS

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:58.542
THEY ARE OUTSIDE OUR PERMIT

00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:00.511
JURISDICTION -- BUT THEY LIKE SO

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:03.280
MUCH THE WORK WE DID WESTERN --

THAT'S SOMETHING I RECOMMEND YOU

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.432
ALL GO LOOK AT THE ADAPTING TO

00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:22.900
RISING TIDES BAY SHORELINE FOOT

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:24.135
EXPLORER.

00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:26.037
IT'S AN ONLINE TOOL THAT ALLOWS

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:27.805
YOU TO LOOK AT VARIOUS AREAS

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:29.607
ALONG THE BAY SHORE LINE AND

00:38:29.674 --> 00:38:31.208
LOOK AT VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF

00:38:31.275 --> 00:38:33.177
RISING SEA LEVEL IN EXTREME

00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:34.679
STORMS TO SEE WHAT GETS

00:38:34.745 --> 00:38:36.313
INUNDATED WHEN AND WHERE THAT

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.782
FLOODING COMES FROM.

00:38:37.848 --> 00:38:39.750
BASED UPON THE MAPPING AND THE

00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:41.719
OTHER VULNERABILITY WORK THAT

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:45.189
THAT WE HAVE DONE TO DATE -- AND

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:47.024
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WELL

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:48.826
WITH THE FUNDS THAT WE WOULD GET --

00:38:48.893 --> 00:38:54.398
WE ARE -- IN IN OUR PROPOSAL IS

00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:56.267
ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:57.768
GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS.

00:38:57.835 --> 00:39:00.371
AND WHAT THIS WOULD DO WOULD BE

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:01.706
TO ALLOW US TO FULLY PLAN.

00:39:01.772 --> 00:39:02.773
AS HE'S ME FULLY FUND OUR

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.341
PLANNING DEPARTMENT WHICH RIGHT

00:39:04.408 --> 00:39:05.910
NOW IS DONE MOST ALL OF THIS

00:39:05.976 --> 00:39:07.545
WORK ON GRANTS AND ONE TIME

AS ONE CONNECTED NETWORK AND THE

00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:28.399
IMPACTS OF WHAT A LOCAL

IMPACT THEIR NEIGHBORS BUT

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:35.339
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IT CAN --

00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:36.941
IMPACT PEOPLE ACROSS.

VERTICALLY TO USE THE FUNDS THAT

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:47.077
THE REGION -- HAS GOTTEN FROM

IS FUNDING RESTORATION PROJECTS

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:57.922
COULD THAT CAN ALSO HELP THE

00:40:57.988 --> 00:41:00.090
SHORELINE BECOME MORE RESILIENT.

00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:02.026
SO -- THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:04.094
ARE PLANNING TO DO -- HAPPY TO

00:41:04.161 --> 00:41:06.497
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU

00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:09.466
MAY HAVE -- UP TO GO BACK AYE.

00:41:09.533 --> 00:41:11.335
INTIMATED THAT THAT YOU DON'T

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:13.304
HAVE ARE SPECIFIC GRANTS

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.539
AVAILABLE TO YOU TO HELP OUT

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:16.507
THESE LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:18.576
THESE OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE

00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:20.911
MAYBE NOT FULLY.

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:23.180
COOKED ON THEIR PILOT PROGRAM

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:25.015
BUT THERE ALONG THE WAY THAT

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:26.784
SINCE YOU'RE HELPING THEM IN THE

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:35.960
ART PROGRAM MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE --

00:41:36.026 --> 00:41:37.528
TO TO EFFECTUATE THAT ADAPTATION

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:39.129
PLANNING AM I OFF BASE IS WOULD

00:41:39.196 --> 00:41:41.398
THAT BE HELPFUL OR HARMFUL.

00:41:41.465 --> 00:41:42.600
A TEAR ACOSTA YOU'RE EXACTLY

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.601
CORRECT THE CDC DOESN'T HAVE

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:46.070
GRANTING AUTHORITY -- SO THAT WE

00:41:46.136 --> 00:41:48.372
HAVEN'T BEEN DOING -- AND DO NOT

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.841
PLAN WITH THESE FUNDS TO DO UP --

00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:52.843
PLANNING GRANTS BUT WHAT WE ARE

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.645
DOING IS USING THESE FUNDS TO

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:56.113
WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE LOCAL

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.781
COMMUNITIES SO WE'RE NOT JUST

00:41:57.848 --> 00:41:59.350
GOING OUT AND DOING AND I STUDY

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:01.252
AND PUTTING IT UP ON THE SHELF --

00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:02.353
WE'RE GOING OUT THERE AND

00:42:02.419 --> 00:42:05.956
WORKING WITH THEM AND PART OF

00:42:06.023 --> 00:42:07.291
WHAT WE SEE.

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:08.692
US AND OUR OUR PARTNER AGENCIES

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:09.994
WERE KIND OF AT THE SWEET SPOT

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.162
IN THIS BECAUSE THE LOCAL FOLKS

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:13.931
ARE ON THE GROUND THEY NEED TO

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:15.566
BE DOING A LOT OF THIS WORK.

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:17.067
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:42:17.134 --> 00:42:17.968
RESOURCES AND THEY CAN'T.

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:19.270
HIRE SOMEBODY TO BECOME AN

00:42:19.336 --> 00:42:20.871
EXPERT ON REGIONAL PLANNING AN

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:23.173
ADAPTATION PLANNING -- BUT WE'RE

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.909
AT THE LEVEL WHERE WE CAN BE

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:26.644
WORKING WITH THEM DIRECTLY BUT

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.579
WE ALSO ARE WORKING WITH THE

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:30.648
OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL -- AND

00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:31.749
THE NATIONAL FOLKS TO BRING THAT

00:42:31.815 --> 00:42:34.652
EXPERTISE DOWN TO THE LOCAL

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:36.420
LEVEL SO -- SO THAT THAT'S KIND

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:38.722
OF THE APPROACH THAT WE SEE

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:41.692
OURSELVES TAKING AND SPECIFIC TO

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:42.993
YOUR POINT.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.428
THERE WAS THE RESILIENT BY

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:46.530
DESIGN COMPETITION IN THE AREA

00:42:46.597 --> 00:42:48.699
THAT LOOKED AT VARIOUS PROJECTS

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:51.635
TO BECOME A RESILIENT AND TO

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:52.937
RISING SEA LEVEL.

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:55.572
AND WE'RE LOOKING TO WORK WITH

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:58.876
THEM AND WITH THE METROPOLITAN

00:42:58.943 --> 00:43:00.110
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION

00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:01.045
ASSOCIATION OF BAY AREA

00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:02.546
GOVERNMENTS AND TAKE SOME OF

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:03.347
THOSE SITES.

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:04.982
AND WERE THEY IDENTIFY

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:06.417
PARTICULAR PROJECTS ON THE

00:43:06.483 --> 00:43:08.118
GROUND IN WORKING WITH FOLKS TO

00:43:08.185 --> 00:43:10.988
TRY TO REALLY DO THOSE PROJECTS.

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:13.290
AS A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW YOU

00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:15.960
ACTUALLY ADAPT -- THAT COULD BE

00:43:16.026 --> 00:43:18.629
THEN BE -- USED OTHER PLACES AS

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.364
WELL SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:22.967
HOW MIGHT THE STATE ASSIST AND

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:26.904
EFFECTUATE AND THAT IS THIS.

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:27.671
IS THIS [inaudible]

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:31.642
THE COASTAL COMMISSION OR THE

00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:34.545
STATE LANDS COMMISSION OR BC DC

00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:37.014
OR THE LOCAL AIR LOCAL COUNTIES

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:39.950
FLOOD CONTROL AREAS HOW MIGHT WE

00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:42.353
MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE

00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:43.887
NEXT STEP WHATEVER THAT MAY BE

00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:45.422
ON THESE.

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:48.625
RESILIENCE BY DESIGN.

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:50.060
WELL I WE BELIEVE THAT THE THE

00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:50.961
ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION WITH

00:43:51.028 --> 00:43:54.665
THAT WE WOULD GET THROUGH THIS --

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:55.799
BUDGET CHANGE POSE A WOULD --

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.301
HELP DO THAT BECAUSE WE WOULD BE

00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:58.736
WORKING WITH THEM ON THESE

00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:00.037
PROJECTS THAT COASTAL

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:02.272
CONSERVANCY -- DOES DO GRANT

00:44:02.339 --> 00:44:04.942
FUNDS IN THE BAY AREA AS WELL AS

00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:07.111
THE REST OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST --

00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:09.113
THAT CAN HELP THE LOCALS WITH

00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:12.883
THESE PROJECTS WE ALSO HAVE.

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:13.650
AND I'M GOING COMMISSIONER WORK

00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:14.952

00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:16.720
FUTURE WHERE WERE WE ARE LOOKING

00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:18.355
AT THE WAYS OF HOW WE'RE GONNA

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:20.958
FINANCE THESE PROJECTS BECAUSE I

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:22.393
AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENTS THAT

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:23.761
HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED TODAY THAT.

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:25.295
PROBABLY THE HARDEST PART ABOUT

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:26.697
THIS IS GOING TO BE FINDING THE

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:28.665
FUNDING TO DO THE ADAPTATION

00:44:28.732 --> 00:44:29.199
MEASURES IT'S GOING TO BE

00:44:29.266 --> 00:44:30.234
REQUIRED.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.236

BEEN GETTING OUT OF OUR STUDIES

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:48.318
BUT IT CERTAINLY IS GOING TO BE

00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:49.720
THE BIG CHALLENGE THAT WE

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:53.157
QUIBBLE OVER THE R. O. I. B. AND

00:44:53.223 --> 00:44:53.924

00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:35.032
GROUP OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT

THESE SOME ORIGIN WE HAVE

00:45:56.086 --> 00:45:56.687
THIRTEEN JURISDICTIONS THAT

00:45:56.753 --> 00:45:57.888
DON'T HAVE LOCAL COASTAL

00:45:57.955 --> 00:45:59.623
PROGRAMS AND WE'VE TARGETED

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:01.425
THOSE FOR GRANTS.

00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:03.760
THE BIG KAHUNA BEING THE CITY OF

00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:05.062
LA.

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.763
DOESN'T HAVE A A LOCAL COASTAL

PROGRESS AND MOVING FORWARD TO

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:19.309
ACTUALLY REALIZE THESE LCP

00:46:19.376 --> 00:46:21.245
CERTIFYING THESE LC PEAS.

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:22.546
THE HERE'S THE RUB.

00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:24.081
AS WE GO THROUGH THIS THIS

00:46:24.148 --> 00:46:26.583
PROCESS AND WE WE THEY DO THE

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:28.352
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS ONCE

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:31.355
YOU PUT THE YOU KNOW A PEN TO

00:46:31.421 --> 00:46:33.056
PAPER ON A MAP.

00:46:33.123 --> 00:46:34.658
A THAT'S WHERE EVERYONE GETS

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:35.926
CONCERNED BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:36.894
CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOSS OF

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.296
THEIR PROPERTY VALUES THERE HE

00:46:39.363 --> 00:46:40.497
THERE FEARFUL OF WHAT'S GOING TO

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:42.065
HAPPEN A FUTURE THAT THE STATE'S

00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:43.133
GOING TO COME IN AND SEES OUR

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.868
PROPERTY THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:47.304
AND THE SORTS OF THINGS -- AND

00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:48.772
THAT'S WHERE THE THE PLANNING

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:50.641
SIDE AND DEVELOPING THE POLICY

00:46:50.707 --> 00:46:52.643
STARTS GETTING REALLY DIFFICULT

00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:54.211
WE HAD A GREAT -- A LOT OF PUSH

00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:56.213
BACK ON OUR RESIDENTIAL

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.482
ADAPTATION GUIDANCE DOCUMENT

00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:59.616
THAT WE HAVE AT THE HEAD OUT FOR

00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:02.686
A FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW.

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:03.987
GETTING A PUBLIC INPUT ON IT.

00:47:04.054 --> 00:47:06.557
ON THE NOTION OF PLANNED RETREAT

00:47:06.623 --> 00:47:09.426
AND HOW -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:11.528
LOSS OF PROPERTY VALUES A LOSS

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:13.830
OF THE TAX BASE AND THINGS LIKE

00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:14.898
AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES WERE

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:16.366
CONCERNED PARTICULAR THE

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:17.367
REALTORS COMMUNITIES.

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:19.136
SO WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:20.204
THESE I THINK THIS IS AN

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:22.539
EVOLUTION OF POLICY OVER TIME

00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:24.341
IT'S AT INCREMENTAL STEPS GOING

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:26.043
FORWARD WE DON'T HAVE TO SOLVE

00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:29.913
IT ALL IN ONE SHOT I THINK.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.014
YOU KNOW WE GET.

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:32.849
MAKE SOME PROGRESS ARE LCP WORK --

00:47:32.916 --> 00:47:33.817
WITH REGARD TODAY MAKING SURE

00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:34.718
THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT

00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:35.786
THEY'RE INVULNERABLE AREAS WE

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:37.788
DISCLOSE THAT -- THE THOSE

00:47:37.854 --> 00:47:41.858
VULNERABILITIES WE FOCUS ON THE

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:43.493
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.628
THE GLUE THAT HOLDS OUR

00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:46.430
COMMUNITIES TOGETHER THAT'S

00:47:46.496 --> 00:47:47.864
WHERE WE SHOULD START THAT'S

00:47:47.931 --> 00:47:53.203
WHERE THE THE THE BANDS.

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:54.938
BUT PLANNING AND DESIGN FOR

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.306
THOSE THINGS NOT JUST THE NOT

00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:57.674
JUST THE ACTUAL PROJECT

00:47:57.741 --> 00:47:59.276
CONSTRUCTION COSTS.

00:47:59.343 --> 00:48:00.410
ARE OW AT MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:48:00.477 --> 00:48:02.579
PARTNERS TELL US THAT THEY NEED

00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:04.648
MONEY FOR PLANNING AND DESIGN OF

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.850
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:07.951
THE OF PROJECTS GOING FORWARD

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:09.419
PARTICULARLY -- WASTE WATER

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:10.821
TREATMENT FACILITIES UP AND DOWN

00:48:10.887 --> 00:48:12.956
THE COAST THESE ARE REALLY

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:15.058
VULNERABLE MOST OF THEM ARE --

00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:17.361
AT SEAL RISE ARE AT SEA LEVEL

00:48:17.427 --> 00:48:18.595
AND THEY'RE REAL IN THAT'S OF

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:22.366
HUGE BIG TICKET ITEM -- TO MOVE

THOSE BACK OFF THE COAST AND

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:25.202
SMALLER DISTRICTS ARE REALLY

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:26.637
STRUGGLING WE HAVE ONCE IN THE

CHANGE ADAPTATION PLANNING.

00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:04.935
IT'S SO YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR

00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:07.170
OPENING COMMENTS. TWO THIRDS OF

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:09.339
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BEACHES ARE

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:10.240
AT RISK QUOTE.

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:12.209
I THINK YOU SUGGEST TO THE TIME

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:13.610
FRAME BUT I DIDN'T CATCH IT IS

00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:15.912
BY THE END OF THE OF THE CENTURY

00:50:15.979 --> 00:50:17.981
BY THE END OF THE CENTURY -- BUT

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:19.916
IT COULD BE A MORE QUICKLY BASED

00:50:19.983 --> 00:50:22.018
ON SOME OF THE SITES WERE SEEING

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:24.888

THE STAMPED UP STORMS WILL SEE

00:50:31.128 --> 00:50:33.230
MUCH MORE RUSSIAN OF OUR SANDY

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:34.765

DO YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DIAL

00:51:12.135 --> 00:51:13.370
IN AND IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THAT

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:14.771
WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT WAKE UP

00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:16.273
CALL FOR THESE COMMUNITIES IF

00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:18.308

PLANNING PROCESS IS THE

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:26.616
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT PIECE

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:28.251
AND THAT'S WHERE THE THE WERE AT

00:51:28.318 --> 00:51:29.786

FIND THE AREAS THAT ARE GONNA BE

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:32.456
VULNERABLE AND YOU KNOW

00:51:32.522 --> 00:51:33.223
DIFFERENT VULNERABILITIES IN

00:53:15.058 --> 00:53:15.759
AVAILABLE.

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.961
BUT THERE IS NO ONE OVERSEER IF

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:19.996
YOU WILL OF ALL OF THE DASH

00:53:20.063 --> 00:53:21.698
PROGRAMS.

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:23.266
SO THEIR INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:24.935
WITH ITS TO THE CONSERVANCY.

00:53:25.001 --> 00:53:27.704
COMMISSION THE CDC IN A SLEW OF

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:29.072
OTHERS.

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:31.107
CONTENT I HAVE AND WHY I THINK

00:53:31.174 --> 00:53:32.542
THAT WE NEED TO GET OUR ARMS

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:35.712
AROUND THIS IS IT'S GOING TO BE

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:37.547
ALL HANDS ON DECK.

00:53:37.614 --> 00:53:39.316
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS RUN

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:40.450
THROUGH RESOURCES.

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:42.919
YES AS AN OVERSEER IN BEING ABLE

00:53:42.986 --> 00:53:44.220

00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:45.922
WOULD LOOK AT WOULD HELP THE LA --

00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:47.457
IS GOING TO BE CONSIDERING THIS

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:49.225
AS A LOOK AT THIS ISSUE.

00:53:49.292 --> 00:53:51.361
BECAUSE WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

00:53:51.428 --> 00:53:52.796
IS THAT WE HAVE MULTIPLE

00:53:52.862 --> 00:53:54.297
AGENCIES.

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:56.266
MOVING FORWARD ON NOT IDENTICAL

00:53:56.333 --> 00:53:58.969
BUT SIMILAR ISSUES AND HOW WE

00:53:59.035 --> 00:54:00.637
CAN COMBINE OUR EFFORTS -- IN

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:02.005
THE IN ALSO FIGURE OUT WHO'S

00:54:02.072 --> 00:54:03.940

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:05.075
TO BE FUNDED.

00:54:05.141 --> 00:54:05.842
IT WOULD LIKE TO BE TO GET YOUR

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:07.444
TAKE ON THAT.

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.579

00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:11.681
ARE AGENCY PARTNERS WE FOUGHT WE

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:13.416

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:23.927
WHO'S ARE PARTNERING WITH THE

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:25.862
OPC FOR EXAMPLE TO GO OUT AND DO

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:28.665
LOCAL OF GOVERNMENT WORKSHOPS UP

WE REALIZE THOSE EFFICIENCIES

00:54:48.685 --> 00:54:51.521
AND THAT THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN.

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:53.790
RESPONSIBILITIES BUT HOW CAN WE

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:56.793

PROGRESS -- THERE AND WE

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.135
CONTINUE.

00:55:05.201 --> 00:55:05.969
TO IF I COULD JUST AMPLIFY THOSE

00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:07.137
REMARKS I'VE BEEN IN COASTAL

00:55:07.203 --> 00:55:11.007
MANAGEMENT FOR GOING ON THIRTY

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:11.274
YEARS NOW.

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.376
AND WE'VE ALWAYS WORKED -- AS

00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:15.345
SISTER AGENCIES TOGETHER -- BUT

00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:18.415
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS LEVEL OF

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:21.151
INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION --

00:55:21.217 --> 00:55:22.786
AS I'VE SEEN WITH THE RISING SEA

00:55:22.852 --> 00:55:25.855
LEVEL ISSUE BOTH THROUGH -- THE

00:55:25.922 --> 00:55:27.290
THE VARIOUS MEANS WE HAD BUT

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:28.491
JUST ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS GOING

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:30.927
BACK AND FORTH -- AND TALKING

ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING -- AND

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:34.998
HOW WE CAN WORK BETTER TOGETHER

00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:38.334
AND SO I I THINK ON THIS TOPIC.

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:40.036
THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM BUT I

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:41.304
THINK WE ARE AT LEAST IN THE

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:42.572
COST OF COMMUNITY I THINK WE ARE

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:44.274
REALLY WORKING HARD TO MAKE SURE

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:45.608
WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER.

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:47.410
AND AS I MENTIONED FOR THE SAN

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:49.079
FRANCISCO BAY THAT'S KIND OF WE

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:51.081
SEE OUR ROLE AS TRYING TO BRING

00:55:51.147 --> 00:55:52.749

THE VARIOUS -- REGIONAL ENTITIES

00:55:57.454 --> 00:55:58.521
LIKE THE METROPOLITAN

00:55:58.588 --> 00:55:59.723
TRANSPORTATION.

00:55:59.789 --> 00:56:01.491
COMMISSION -- IN THE WORK

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:02.926
THEY'RE DOING AND THEN THE THE

00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:04.661
STATE AGENCIES TO TRY TO MAKE

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:06.362
SURE THAT WE ARE ALL COR DATING

00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:08.832
AND HAVE ONE REGIONAL FRAMEWORK

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:10.567
THAT WE ARE DOING.

THAT LARGE SCALE PLAN RIGHT.

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:26.049
AND ACTUALLY START MOVING

00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:27.183

ADDITIONAL DOLLARS WHATEVER THAT

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:31.087
SOURCE MAY BE.

00:56:31.154 --> 00:56:31.621

DO YOU AND WOULD ALSO.

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:48.651
I DON'T SPEAK FOR RESOURCE

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:50.853
AGENCY BUT I KNOW AS THE ENTITY

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:52.989
OVER MANY OF THESE AGENCIES TO

00:59:53.056 --> 00:59:55.024
COORDINATE WITH THOSE ENTITIES

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:56.759
AS WELL I CAST A GLANCE QUESTION

00:59:56.826 --> 01:00:00.663
BECAUSE COMMISSION AND BUSH

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:01.931
PROTECTION COUNCIL.

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:02.699
YEAH I I THINK COORDINATION IS A

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:03.333
REALLY IMPORTANT KEY BOTH AT THE

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:03.933
STATE LEVEL AND WE WILL LOOK

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:04.534
INTO THAT AND SEE IF THERE'S

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.134
GUIDANCE WE CAN GIVE I THINK

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:05.635
THERE ARE THINGS THAT

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:07.270
LEGISLATURE CAN DO.

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:09.005
TERMS OF BEING STRATEGIC ABOUT

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.373
TARGETING WHEN IT ALLOCATES

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.008
MONEY TO A PARTICULAR AGENCY FOR

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:13.142
PARTICULAR ROLE THERE HAVE BEEN

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:15.378
SOME EXAMPLES FOR EXAMPLE WHEN.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.847
LBC IS BEEN GIVEN FUNDING FIRST

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:19.749
VERY SIMILAR THINGS AS THE

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:21.150
CONSERVANCY IS DOING IT SO IT

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.051
WAS SO YOU KNOW WE COULD

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:23.453
PROBABLY SEND MORE CLEAR SIGNALS

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:26.055
IF WE WANT TO DELINEATE ROLES --

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:27.123
I THINK THAT COORDINATION AT THE

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:29.559
LOCAL LEVEL IS ESSENTIAL AS WELL

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:30.760
AS WE'VE HEARD IN THE SAN

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:31.394
FRANCISCO BAY IT'S A LOT EASIER

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.829
BECAUSE IT'S A BATH TUB AND IT'S

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:34.063
PRETTY CLEAR IF YOU DO THIS ON

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.999
THE SIDE IT MAY AFFECT THE SIDE.

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:37.433
AND THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER BUT

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.968
BUT THERE ARE THOSE IN A RELATED

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.670
AFFECTS ALONG THE OUTSIDE COAST

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:45.541
TO IF YOU PUT UP A WALL IN.

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:46.642
ONE YEAH IT WILL AFFECT

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:47.210
POTENTIALLY THE BEACH IN A

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:48.277
NEIGHBORING AREA AND AND IT

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:49.779
PROBABLY IS EASIER FOR LOCAL

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.814
JURISDICTIONS TO VIEW THEIR OWN

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:52.882
ACTIONS MORE IN A VACUUM SYSTEM

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:54.350
MORE THAT REGIONAL COORDINATION

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:55.785
IS PROBABLY.

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:56.386
OVERALL THE STATE CAN REALLY

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:59.022
TAKE -- OUTSIDE OF THE BAY AS

01:00:59.088 --> 01:00:59.756
WELL FOR SOME OF THOSE

01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:03.026
COORDINATED IMPACTS THE BRANCH

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:04.660
HAS DONE A GOOD JOB WITH THE

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:05.828
CLIMATE ACTION TEAM WHICH

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:08.398
TECHNICALLY IS HOUSED IN THE EPA

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:09.932
BUT FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WAS.

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.567
REALLY RUN FROM THE RESOURCE

01:01:11.634 --> 01:01:14.437
AGENCY BUT THAT'S A HORIZONTAL --

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.805
DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE STATE

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:17.173
AGENCIES.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.908
COINCIDENTALLY THE CHAIR HAS A

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:21.511
BILL ON A DAY A CHIEF ADAPTATION

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:22.612
OFFICER WHICH WOULD BE PARKED IN

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:25.148
OPR WHICH WOULD HELP WITH THE

01:01:25.214 --> 01:01:26.682
VERTICAL INTEGRATION OF WE'RE

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:28.151
TALKING WHAT THE DISCUSSIONS

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:28.751
BETWEEN.

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:31.154
THE STATE AND THE REGION'S AND

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.523
LOCALITIES SO THAT THAT FLOW OF

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:37.593
INFORMATION AND FUNDS TO COMMEND

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.095
CHIEF -- CENTER MONNING.

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:40.196
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THE LA --

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:42.198
JUST REFER TO THIS BUT MY

01:01:42.265 --> 01:01:43.533
QUESTION.

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:44.667
IN YOU THIS MAY BE IS PROJECT BY

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.135
PROJECT COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:48.771
BUT SOME PEOPLE BUSINESSES AND

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:50.173
RESIDENTIAL AREAS THINK A SEA

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:50.606
WALL.

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:53.843
IS THE SOLUTION. ONE IF YOU HAVE

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:54.410
ANY COM IS THERE ANY.

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:59.315
STATE OF THE ART OR OR MORE --

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.184
POLICY ORIENTATION EITHER OF

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.252
YOUR AGENCIES ABOUT THE

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:04.887
POTENTIAL ROLE OF SEA WALLS I

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:06.522
THINK SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT'S

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:09.292
THE EASY FIX.

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:12.028
WELL I CAN START OFF THE OF SEA

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:13.096
WALLS DESTROYED BEACHES.

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:14.764
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:17.433
AND BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.469
AT IT IN THE CONTEXT EVERY.

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:20.937
THERE'S DIFFERENT CONTEXT UP AND

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:21.904
DOWN THE COAST DIFFERENT

01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:23.072
SEARCHES CIRCUMSTANCES THERE

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:24.407
CERTAIN URBAN AREAS WHERE

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.175
ARMORING IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:29.545
THE ADAPTATION STRATEGY.

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:30.179
AND WE JUST HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:31.147
THAT.

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:31.681
BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:32.615
ALTERNATIVE YOU'RE NOT GONNA

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:34.183
TEAR OUT YOU KNOW THE CITY OF

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:37.453
LONG BEACH -- DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO --

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.689
AND SO THERE THERE ARE AT SEA

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:41.390
WALLS HAVE THEIR PLACE AS PART

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:43.893
OF AN ADAPTATION STRATEGY IT'S

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.395
JUST THAT.

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:47.029
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SEQUELS ONE

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.030
OR YOU'VE GOT TO MITIGATE YOU

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:49.398
GOTTA THINK ABOUT WELL WHAT

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:50.032
OTHER A WHAT ONE OF THE AREAS

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:52.935
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO RETREAT.

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:54.804
TO RETAIN OUR BEACHES AND TO YOU

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:57.673
KNOW TO IT TO FEED TO HAVE THAT

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.307
SETTLEMENT COMING OFFER BLUFFS

01:02:58.374 --> 01:02:59.809
AND FEEDING THOSE BEACHES AND

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:00.977
READERS HIM.

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:02.778
LOOK AND WE HAVE TO BE HONEST TO

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:03.779
SEAL RISE WE'RE JUST GONNA LAYS

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:05.648
EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:06.516
DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:08.251
LOSE SOME BEACHES BECAUSE OF THE

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:10.953
AT THE AT ALL THE ADVANCING.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.489
SEAL RISE AND ROAD UNIT OF THIS

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:18.194
HAPPENING SO QUICKLY.

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:20.596
BUT THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO --

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:21.564
TO PRESERVE OUR BEACHES UP IN AN

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.333
ECHO THREE NOURISHMENT AND OTHER --

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.869
STRATEGIES.

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:28.504
YEAH IN THE IN THE BARRIO OF WE

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:29.872
ARE A BIT MORE SHELTERED AND SO

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:34.110
THEREFORE -- IT IS POSSIBLE IT

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:35.411
WOULD IMPOSSIBLE THE HARD IN THE

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:37.413
ENTIRE SHORELINE OF THE BABY BUT

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.349
WOULD THAT BE A GOOD IDEA IN.

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:44.620
IN TERMS OF THE THE WETLANDS.

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:47.623
PROBABLY NOT AND WE HAVE FOUND

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:50.960
THAT NATURAL SHORELINE.

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:52.828
CAN ACTUALLY HELP PROTECT THE

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:54.197
DEVELOPMENT BEHIND THEM SO

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:57.800
RESTORATION PROJECTS -- CAN

01:03:57.867 --> 01:04:00.336
REDUCE FLOODING IN INUNDATION OF

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:01.971
THE DEVELOPED AREAS AND MAYBE IF

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:03.272
YOU HAVE TO BUILD A LEVEE YOU

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:04.140
BUILD IT LOWER.

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:06.409
A PERFECT EXAMPLE IS THE SOUTH

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:09.312
BAY THE SHORELINE -- RESTORATION

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:14.483
OF THE OLD SALT PONDS -- THAT.

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.385
ACTUALLY PROTECT DOWNTOWN SAN

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:19.355
JOSE THAT'S SUBSIDED AROUND

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:20.856
TWELVE FEET FROM HISTORIC WATER

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.525
ASKED BACK WHEN IT WAS THE

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:25.294
VALLEY OF HEART'S DESIRE -- AND

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:28.631
SO -- IF DO THE RESTORATION

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.266
PROJECT WE'RE ACTUALLY HELPING

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:31.634
TO PROTECT DEVELOPMENT AND SO

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:33.669
THAT'S THAT'S THE THE APPROACH

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:34.770
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE IN

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:37.006
THIS ALSO CAN A ADDRESS SOME OF

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:38.507
THE ISSUES OF GREENHOUSE GAS

01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:40.977
MITIGATION BECAUSE THAT'S GREEN

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:43.412
CARBON THAT'S SEQUESTERING

01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:45.414
CARBON IN THESE AREAS SO.

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:50.286
SO WE HAVE A FOCUS ON THAT --

01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:52.088
BUT IT IS TRUE THAT SOME AREAS --

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:53.289
IF THAT ISN'T JUST GOING TO WORK

01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:54.457
AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:55.925
SHORELINE ARMING SO WE'RE GONNA

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:59.562
HAVE TO LOOK AT AT BOTH MODELS.

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:00.997
OKAY THERE'S NO ACTION THIS

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:04.333
COULD BE TAKEN HERE DURING THE

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:04.934
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:06.335

THANK YOU WE'LL CLOSE THAT

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.009
MATTER AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:14.810
NUMBER.

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:16.746
ELEVEN THIS WILL BE BE DC'S

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:20.116
METRO CENTER.

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:22.051
THE CONTINUING SAGA THIRD TIME'S

THE REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:43.306

FACILITIES WOULD BE TAKEN OVER

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:41.030
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:43.366
THAT NEEDS TO EXPAND -- AND

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:45.101
WOULD OTHERWISE NEED TO LOOK

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:50.706
OUTSIDE -- FOR OTHER REAL ESTATE

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:52.308

BY THE DIRECTOR READY AND WE

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:34.868
HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED AND YOUR

01:39:34.935 --> 01:39:36.470
YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAVE NOT BEEN

01:39:36.537 --> 01:39:38.272
PROVIDED A PRIORITIZED LIST --

01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:39.907
THE LIST THAT WAS GIVEN IS YOU

01:39:39.973 --> 01:39:41.608

ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS

01:39:43.177 --> 01:39:44.578
FOR THE PROJECTS AND PRETTY MUCH

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:46.513
EVERYTHING IS IN THERE

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:47.614
ALPHABETICAL ORDER.

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:48.449
I'M AND AND THERE'S A LOT OF

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:49.249
THINGS ON THAT LIST THAT ARE

01:39:49.316 --> 01:39:50.184
MAYBE NOT THINGS YOU EVEN

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:51.485
TRADITIONALLY THINK OF AS BEING

01:39:51.552 --> 01:39:52.986
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SO WE

01:39:53.053 --> 01:39:54.188
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

01:39:54.254 --> 01:39:56.190
YOU HAVE A SENSE AND THAT --

01:39:56.256 --> 01:39:58.258
PARK STAFF HAS PROVIDED SOME

01:39:58.325 --> 01:39:59.860
CATEGORIES OF HOW THEY'RE GONNA

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:01.195
AND PRIORITIZE PROJECTS BUT

01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:02.563
REALLY GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF

01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:04.064
THE SIZE OF THEIR BACKLOG IT'S

01:40:04.131 --> 01:40:05.099
REALLY.

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:06.100
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:07.034
THEY'RE GONNA SPEND THESE FUNDS

01:40:07.101 --> 01:40:08.235
ON WITHOUT GETTING A PRIORITIZED

01:40:08.302 --> 01:40:09.536
LIST AND SO YOU THINK THAT WILL

01:40:09.603 --> 01:40:10.704
BE IMPORTANT.

01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:13.240

WHAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND

01:40:45.005 --> 01:40:46.373

01:46:03.156 --> 01:46:04.891
HAD SOMETHING THERE BUT BUT IF

01:46:04.958 --> 01:46:06.126
YOU GOT TO GO OUT AND HOLD

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:07.961
EVERYBODY'S HAND THAT'S SUCKING

UP A LOT OF MONEY.

01:46:09.696 --> 01:46:11.665
IT DOESN'T GO INTO.

01:46:11.732 --> 01:46:14.334
THE FIX IT OR OR OR THE PARK

APPROACHING THIS FROM A LESSONS

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.582
LEARNED EFFORT FROM THE PAST

01:46:28.648 --> 01:46:30.350
THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST -- PART OF

01:46:30.417 --> 01:46:32.018
IN A BOND FUNDS TO GO OUT TO THE

01:46:32.085 --> 01:46:32.819

WE TREAT THESE FUNDS VERY

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:36.089
DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO ST

01:46:36.156 --> 01:46:37.324
GENERAL FUND TEEN AND WE DON'T

01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:39.292

01:46:40.794 --> 01:46:42.963
THAT'S UNDER SB.

01:46:43.029 --> 01:46:44.431
FIVE AND THE INTENTION BEHIND US --

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:45.465
AND THAT THIS PART OF MONEY

01:46:45.532 --> 01:46:47.367
WASN'T NECESSARILY SET ASIDE FOR

01:46:47.434 --> 01:46:49.636

01:46:51.104 --> 01:46:52.405
ORGANIZATION.

01:46:52.472 --> 01:46:55.876
ON HOW TO DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS --

01:46:55.942 --> 01:46:58.612
WE ALSO WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW WE

01:46:58.678 --> 01:47:00.580
WE DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF ALL OF

01:47:00.647 --> 01:47:02.282
THE NEEDS WE ABSOLUTELY JUST

01:47:02.349 --> 01:47:03.383
WITHIN CENTER CAN I COULD

01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:05.318
PROBABLY EASILY SPEND THIRTY

01:47:05.385 --> 01:47:06.787
SEVEN MILLION AND THINKING ABOUT

01:47:06.853 --> 01:47:08.922
SOME PLACES THAT WE KNOW OF BUT

01:47:08.989 --> 01:47:10.791
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE

01:47:10.857 --> 01:47:11.358
CHALLENGES.

01:47:11.424 --> 01:47:12.692
THAT WERE ALSO IS A STATE TRYING

01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:14.294
TO OVERCOME IS REACHING ALL

01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:16.830
COMMUNITIES SOME COMMUNITIES ARE

01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:19.065
JUST A BETTER POSITIONED TO

01:47:19.132 --> 01:47:21.168
ACTUALLY APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS

01:47:21.234 --> 01:47:21.902
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS A

01:47:21.968 --> 01:47:22.335
REAL.

01:47:22.402 --> 01:47:24.538
DISCUSSION TOPIC AND DEVELOPING

01:47:24.604 --> 01:47:28.041
SB -- FIVE AND PROPOSITION SIXTY

01:47:28.108 --> 01:47:28.875
EIGHT IS THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:47:28.942 --> 01:47:30.110
HOW FUNDS HAD BEEN ISSUED IN THE

01:47:30.177 --> 01:47:31.545
PAST HOW DO WE REACH THOSE

01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:33.146
COMMUNITIES THAT MAYBE NEED A

01:47:33.213 --> 01:47:34.648
LITTLE MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:36.950
OR THE MINIMUM NEED TO BE AWARE

01:47:37.017 --> 01:47:38.552
THAT THESE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE

01:47:38.618 --> 01:47:40.787
WE LIVE ON IT BREEDS AND EAT

01:47:40.854 --> 01:47:42.656
THIS EVERY DAY SO WE FEEL LIKE

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:44.357
EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS BUT

01:47:44.424 --> 01:47:45.158
IN FACT.

01:47:45.225 --> 01:47:46.092
THEY DON'T AND SO MISTER

01:47:46.159 --> 01:47:47.527
MITCHELL COULD PROBABLY TALK A

01:47:47.594 --> 01:47:49.029
LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT MY IT'S

01:47:49.095 --> 01:47:50.096
IMPORTANT.

01:47:50.163 --> 01:47:51.865
DEFINITELY -- THE THE MEASURE

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:55.168
ALSO CALLS FOR PARK ADVANCEMENT --

01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:56.636
REVENUE -- ENHANCED WITH

01:47:56.703 --> 01:47:58.138
MEASURES -- SOME CITIES AND

01:47:58.205 --> 01:48:01.608
COMMUNITIES -- PAST GENERAL --

01:48:01.675 --> 01:48:03.610
INFRASTRUCTURAL MEASURES THAT.

01:48:03.677 --> 01:48:04.811
MADE TOUCH ON PARKS BUT ARE NOT

01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:07.147
SPECIFIC TO PARKS WE WE HAVE TO

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:08.782
IDENTIFY WHAT ALL OF THOSE

01:48:08.849 --> 01:48:10.150
AREN'T AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:11.184
WE'RE WE'RE FOR A FULFILLING

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:12.419
SPIRIT OF WHAT THE LAW SAYS IT

01:48:12.485 --> 01:48:13.720
NEEDS TO FULFILL.

01:48:13.787 --> 01:48:14.921
AND SOME OF THESE MAY BE SMALL

01:48:14.988 --> 01:48:18.458
DISTRICTS THAT THERE THAT ARE --

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:18.959
AGAIN.

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:21.962
I THE CITY MAY PASS A A A A

01:48:22.028 --> 01:48:28.201
SMALL TAX IN A COMMUNITY THAT IS

01:48:28.268 --> 01:48:31.271
A LONG -- FOR ONGOING

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:32.105
MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION THEY

MAY BE LOOKING AT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:48:33.073 --> 01:48:33.874
DEVELOPMENT SO WHAT WE FOUND IS

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:34.875
THAT THE UNIVERSE OF THAT'S OUT

01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:35.742

NEED TO EVALUATE -- THE

01:48:53.693 --> 01:48:55.028
DETERMINE IF THEY ACTUALLY ARE

01:48:55.095 --> 01:48:56.329

DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- AND I

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:06.099

01:50:08.802 --> 01:50:09.970

WANT TO BE ABLE TO ECHO WHERE

01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:14.741
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS

01:50:14.808 --> 01:50:15.675

AND SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC -- AND

01:50:27.387 --> 01:50:28.655
DO YOU HAVE A TIME LINE ON WHEN

01:50:28.722 --> 01:50:32.058
YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE

01:50:32.125 --> 01:50:33.927

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:34.861
I'M I FEEL LIKE IT'S RATHER

01:50:34.928 --> 01:50:35.428
EMINENT I THINK IT'S UNDER

01:50:35.495 --> 01:50:36.730
REVIEW WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION

01:50:36.796 --> 01:50:38.698
SO I WOULD I'M HOPING THAT

01:50:38.765 --> 01:50:40.233
BEFORE THE NEXT HEARING.

01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:41.401
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO FOLLOW

01:50:41.468 --> 01:50:42.669
THE SAME PROCESS THAT WE HAVE

01:50:42.736 --> 01:50:44.004
EVERY OTHER YEAR SO IT'S WE

01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:45.605
RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

01:50:45.672 --> 01:50:46.840
THAT YOU SEE THAT YOU GET AN

01:50:46.906 --> 01:50:47.807
ASSESSMENT.

01:50:47.874 --> 01:50:49.109
OF HOW DUTY PRIORITIZE AND WE'RE

HAPPY TO DISCUSS WITH YOUR

METHODOLOGY BUT I THINK YOU'RE

01:50:51.444 --> 01:50:52.278
GONNA SEE OF SIMILAR

01:50:52.345 --> 01:50:54.114
PRIVATIZATION METHODOLOGY AS

01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:56.583
YOU'VE SEEN IN OUR LIST OVER THE

01:50:56.649 --> 01:50:57.884
PAST SEVERAL YEARS I WOULD LOVE

01:50:57.951 --> 01:50:59.219
TO BE A SIT DOWN PRIOR TO THE

01:50:59.285 --> 01:51:00.687
HEARING JUST APPEAR TO GO AND BE.

01:51:00.754 --> 01:51:02.255
HAPPY TO GREAT I THINK THE OTHER

01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:04.190
PIECES AND I UNDERSTAND -- MR

01:51:04.257 --> 01:51:05.025
DIFFERENT DOUBLE CHECK TO WHAT

01:51:05.091 --> 01:51:06.259
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT REGARDS OF

01:51:06.326 --> 01:51:07.327
THIRTY SEVEN MILLION THE ONE

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:09.029
CONCERN THAT I WILL THROW OUT --

01:51:09.095 --> 01:51:12.665
IN NO IT'S A BIT OF A BROKEN

01:51:12.732 --> 01:51:14.534
RECORD.

01:51:14.601 --> 01:51:16.036
IT'S WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

01:51:16.102 --> 01:51:17.103
BERMAN COMMUNITIES.

01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:18.705
ANY LOOK AT RURAL COMMUNITIES.

01:51:18.772 --> 01:51:23.043
THEY'RE NOT PASSING PARK RANGERS.

01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:26.012
AND WHAT I WORRY ABOUT.

01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:28.148
IS THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE

01:51:28.214 --> 01:51:31.384
INCENTIVIZED. TO BE ABLE TO GO

01:51:31.451 --> 01:51:32.552
TO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE PASSED

01:51:32.619 --> 01:51:34.354
PARK RANGERS.

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:37.223
BUT WHERE WE NEED TO HELP THE

01:51:37.290 --> 01:51:38.591
MOST ARE MORE.

01:51:38.658 --> 01:51:41.761
RURAL AND URBAN WHO CANDIDLY

01:51:41.828 --> 01:51:43.163
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES SO

01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:46.533
THAT'S WHY I REMAIN CONCERNED ON

01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:47.901
THIS ONE AREA AND JUST WONDER IF

01:51:47.967 --> 01:51:49.436
YOU HAVE A RESPONSE.

01:51:49.502 --> 01:51:50.403
CERTAINLY WORK.

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:51.805
THIS PARTICULAR REVENUE ENHANCER

01:51:51.871 --> 01:51:53.907
ONE SORT OF REWARD FOR THAT THE

01:51:53.973 --> 01:51:55.909
LEGISLATURE GAVE ART FOR THOSE

01:51:55.975 --> 01:51:57.143
COMMUNITIES THAT DID IN FACT.

01:51:57.210 --> 01:51:58.745
UNDERSTAND EXTEND THEMSELVES

01:51:58.812 --> 01:52:00.280
THERE'S ALSO ROLL COMPONENTS IN

01:52:00.346 --> 01:52:02.248
THERE -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN

01:52:02.315 --> 01:52:04.751
YOU LOOK AT OUR OVERALL --

01:52:04.818 --> 01:52:06.086
GUIDELINES THE STATE TO STATE

01:52:06.152 --> 01:52:09.089
WY PART PROGRAM AS AN EXAMPLE --

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:10.924
WE DESIGNED AND IN SUCH A WAY

01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:12.392
THAT -- THERE'S A NATURAL

01:52:12.459 --> 01:52:13.960
ORGANIC PROCESS THAT TAKES PLACE

01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:16.463
WHERE -- RURAL COMMUNITIES CAN

01:52:16.529 --> 01:52:17.163
COMPETE.

01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:19.065
S. ON PAR WITH THE URBAN

01:52:19.132 --> 01:52:21.000
COMMUNITIES WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT

01:52:21.067 --> 01:52:22.268

IN IN WHAT WAS JUST FOCUS IN

01:53:50.490 --> 01:53:51.057
THREE SEVEN MILLION THE REASON

01:53:51.124 --> 01:53:52.392
BEING IS THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN I

CONTINUES TO BE PARTICULARLY IN

01:54:08.508 --> 01:54:10.109

01:58:48.054 --> 01:58:50.389
WAY SO WE'RE HOPING YOU GUYS CAN

GET CREATIVE AND TRY TO FIND A

01:58:52.024 --> 01:58:53.659
WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK BECAUSE

01:58:53.726 --> 01:58:54.360
OTHERWISE.

01:58:54.427 --> 01:58:56.829
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THAT THAT

01:58:56.896 --> 01:58:57.997
SORT OF DEEPER COMMUNITY

01:58:58.064 --> 01:59:00.032
ENGAGEMENT EQUITY PROMISE WE'RE

01:59:00.099 --> 01:59:01.067
TALKING ABOUT HERE SO DIRECTOR

01:59:01.133 --> 01:59:03.436
JEFF COMMISSURE -- SENATOR STERN --

01:59:03.503 --> 01:59:04.904
BUT BEYOND JUST KIND OF THIS

01:59:04.971 --> 01:59:06.339
THIS SPECIFIC PART OF MONEY I

01:59:06.405 --> 01:59:08.774
WOULD SAY -- THAT THERE'S BEEN

01:59:08.841 --> 01:59:10.743
THIS REAL RECOGNITION -- THAT

01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:13.346
THE KEY ROLE THAT TRANSPORTATION

01:59:13.412 --> 01:59:15.314
PLAYS IN IS VERY OR FAX US I

01:59:15.381 --> 01:59:16.315
THINK THE STATE HAS TRIED TO

01:59:16.382 --> 01:59:18.251
ADDRESS IT IN VARIOUS AREAS -- I

01:59:18.317 --> 01:59:19.218
THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN OTHER

01:59:19.285 --> 01:59:21.621
DEPARTMENTS OF HAD FUNDING AND

01:59:21.687 --> 01:59:23.256
GRANTS PROGRAMS I THINK IN THE

01:59:23.322 --> 01:59:24.824
IN THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY SAID

01:59:24.891 --> 01:59:25.591
THERE'S BEEN KIND OF AN

01:59:25.658 --> 01:59:27.994
EXPRESSION AND UNDERSTANDING --

01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:29.128
THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE

01:59:29.195 --> 01:59:31.797
NEED TO FOCUS ON WE HAVE BEEN --

01:59:31.864 --> 01:59:33.799
WE HAVE SOME PILOT PROJECTS AND

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:35.902
SOME OF OUR PARKS WE ARE WE HAVE

01:59:35.968 --> 01:59:38.771
A PORTS PROGRAM AND IT'S A IT'S

01:59:38.838 --> 01:59:40.873
A IN REAL TIME USING VIDEO

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:42.842
CONFERENCING TO REACH K. THROUGH

01:59:42.909 --> 01:59:43.709
TWELVE CHILDREN.

01:59:43.776 --> 01:59:45.111
AND WE'VE ACTUALLY IT'S A IT'S A

01:59:45.177 --> 01:59:47.313
PRETTY ROBUST PROGRAM THAT WE'VE

01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:49.849
HAD FOR PROBABLY NINE OR TEN

01:59:49.916 --> 01:59:51.551
YEARS BUT WHAT ALWAYS

01:59:51.617 --> 01:59:52.952
DISAPPOINTEDUS WHEN WE I THINK

01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:53.986
COLLECTIVELY WE NEVER FELT GOOD

01:59:54.053 --> 01:59:54.587
ABOUT.

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:55.922
IS IT ALLOWS FOR A LIVE

01:59:55.988 --> 01:59:57.823
INTERACTION YOU MIGHT HAVE AN

01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:58.824
INTERPRETER THERE IN A TIDAL

01:59:58.891 --> 02:00:00.893
POOL TALKING ABOUT ON THE

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.762
IMPORTANCE OF ROLE THAT STARFISH

02:00:02.828 --> 02:00:04.664
PLAY BUT THEN IT DOESN'T GET THE

02:00:04.730 --> 02:00:06.966
CHILD ACTUALLY OUT INTO THE PARK

02:00:07.033 --> 02:00:07.900
IN THE OUTDOORS.

02:00:07.967 --> 02:00:09.835
SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO

02:00:09.902 --> 02:00:11.971
IS TO ACTUALLY THEN GIVE A PARK

02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:13.573
PASS -- BUT EVEN IF YOU GIVE A

02:00:13.639 --> 02:00:15.308
PASS TO COME TO THE PARK

02:00:15.374 --> 02:00:16.842
TRANSPORTATION ALSO BECOMES A

02:00:16.909 --> 02:00:18.778
BARRIER -- WE'VE TRIED TO WORK

02:00:18.844 --> 02:00:19.979

PRIME EXAMPLE.

02:00:36.762 --> 02:00:37.463
THERE IS NO PUBLIC

02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:43.903
TRANSPORTATION THAT GOES ALONG

02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:45.471

OF PARTNER WITH COMMUNITIES

02:02:19.532 --> 02:02:20.933

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:26.539
THAT THE FRIENDS OF SANTA CRUZ

02:02:43.155 --> 02:02:44.623
IS GETTING A LOT OF AND A

02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:45.825
SERVICE WE'RE HOPEFUL ABOUT THE

02:02:45.891 --> 02:02:47.493
BOND MEASURE BUT I WILL TELL YOU --

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:48.494
WHEN WE DID THE PUBLIC

02:02:48.561 --> 02:02:50.429
ENGAGEMENT MATT -- SESSIONS WE

02:02:50.496 --> 02:02:51.464

02:02:52.131 --> 02:02:53.265
MADE SO WE MADE IT CLEAR WITH

02:02:53.332 --> 02:02:54.300
THE PUBLIC THAT THAT WAS STILL

02:02:54.366 --> 02:02:56.235
PENDING BUT IT ALSO GAVE US A

02:02:56.302 --> 02:02:57.937
SENSE TO STILL IDENTIFY THE

02:02:58.003 --> 02:02:59.004
NEEDS OUT THERE.

02:02:59.071 --> 02:03:00.740
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE ARE

02:03:00.806 --> 02:03:02.541
OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS IS NOT THE

02:03:02.608 --> 02:03:04.477
PARK BOND MONEY IS NOT THE ONLY

02:03:04.543 --> 02:03:06.178
PLACE THAT WE WOULD WITH THAT WE

02:03:06.245 --> 02:03:08.013

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:09.582
NEED TO GET A BETTER HANDLE.

02:03:09.648 --> 02:03:10.983
ON WHAT THE NEEDS ARE OUT IN THE

02:03:11.050 --> 02:03:12.017
COMMUNITIES.

02:03:12.084 --> 02:03:13.719
THE OTHER THING I WOULD SHARE IS

02:03:13.786 --> 02:03:15.321
THAT I THINK YOU HEARD THE

02:03:15.387 --> 02:03:16.322

02:03:17.356 --> 02:03:18.824
REAL TIME CONVERSATIONS GOING ON

02:03:18.891 --> 02:03:20.092
IN THE FIRST THING THAT WE NEED

02:03:20.159 --> 02:03:22.027
TO GET A HANDLE ON IS OKAY WELL

02:03:22.094 --> 02:03:24.563
IF IT CAN'T FIND PROGRAMS.

02:03:24.630 --> 02:03:25.631
WHAT CAN IT FUND SO FOR HALF

02:03:25.698 --> 02:03:27.800
PERHAPS COULD YOU USE SOME OF

02:03:27.867 --> 02:03:30.402
THOSE FUNDS TO PURCHASE A BUSES?

02:03:30.469 --> 02:03:31.904

THAT IF WE'RE REALLY SERIOUS

02:03:47.987 --> 02:03:49.755
ABOUT PARKS BEING FOR ALL THAT

02:03:49.822 --> 02:03:51.390
TRANSPORTATION IS ABSOLUTELY

02:03:51.457 --> 02:03:53.125
SOMETHING THAT AS A STATE WE

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:54.093

02:06:00.853 --> 02:06:02.054
NECESSARILY I THINK THE IT'S

02:06:02.121 --> 02:06:03.055
PROBABLY JUST NOT THE RIGHT

02:06:03.122 --> 02:06:04.089
BUCKETS SO WE'RE WORKING THROUGH

02:06:04.156 --> 02:06:06.025
THE FEMALE EFFORT WITH CALLAWAY

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:08.193
YES -- AND YOU'RE RIGHT I MEAN

02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:09.929
WE'VE SUFFERED -- SEVERAL FIRES

02:06:09.995 --> 02:06:11.730
ITEM IT WAS A HISTORIC FIRE YEAR

02:06:11.797 --> 02:06:13.832
FOR CALIFORNIA SO WE HAD THE CAR

02:06:13.899 --> 02:06:15.701
FIRE IN READING -- WE HAD THE

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:17.770
CAMPFIRE THE CAMPFIRE THE IN THE

02:06:17.836 --> 02:06:19.004
PORT ROLE THAT STATE PARKS PLAY

02:06:19.071 --> 02:06:21.240
DOES REALLY LAST WE HAD LAST --

STATE RECREATION AREA BUT WE ARE

02:06:25.844 --> 02:06:27.446
SERVING MORE -- AN IMPORTANT

02:06:27.513 --> 02:06:29.381
ROLE IN TERMS OF HOUSING --

02:06:29.448 --> 02:06:31.750
DISPLACED INDIVIDUAL SO WE HAVE

02:06:31.817 --> 02:06:33.285
ONE OF OUR CAMP LIPS THAT WERE

02:06:33.352 --> 02:06:34.820
UNDER CONTRACT WITH FEMA.

02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:36.088
AND THEY'RE PUTTING IN FEMA

02:06:36.155 --> 02:06:37.890
TRAILERS -- TO HOUSE DISPLACED

02:06:37.957 --> 02:06:41.026

A AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE LOCAL

COUNTY -- TO THERE WAS ANOTHER

02:06:45.464 --> 02:06:47.032
WAVE OF DISPLACED INDIVIDUALS

02:06:47.099 --> 02:06:48.767
THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING HOUSE

02:06:48.834 --> 02:06:50.069
THERE WE FOUND THAT DURING THE

02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:51.670
FIRES FRANKLY WE NOW THE FIRST

02:06:51.737 --> 02:06:53.672
THING WE DO IS WE LOOK AT WHAT

02:06:53.739 --> 02:06:55.174
PARKS EVEN IF A PARK IS ON A PER

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:56.442
IN A BURNT POTENTIAL BERNIE AREA.

02:06:56.508 --> 02:06:57.810
BUT THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT

02:06:57.876 --> 02:07:00.479
PEOPLE TEND TO RUN TO THE PARK --

02:07:00.546 --> 02:07:01.580
FOR THE FIRST PLACE OF SHELTER

02:07:01.647 --> 02:07:02.881
AND RESPITE SO WE PLAYED A PART

02:07:02.948 --> 02:07:03.716
IN ROLE IN THAT.

02:07:03.782 --> 02:07:05.818
IN TERMS OF THE WILL THE FIRE WE

02:07:05.884 --> 02:07:08.120
HAD MORE -- DISPLACED PARK --

02:07:08.187 --> 02:07:09.788
STAFF LIKE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES

02:07:09.855 --> 02:07:12.358
HOUSING -- BUT WE HAD MORE PARK

02:07:12.424 --> 02:07:14.626
DAMAGE AND SO AS YOU KNOW -- BUT

02:07:14.693 --> 02:07:16.295
WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW MUD SLIDES

02:07:16.362 --> 02:07:17.730
AND WATER SAID SOME THINGS THAT

02:07:17.796 --> 02:07:18.430
WE'VE GOT TO THINK THROUGH.

02:07:18.497 --> 02:07:19.932
THE WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY

02:07:19.999 --> 02:07:21.233
WITH CALLAWAY -- SO -- I

02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:22.568
WOULDN'T EXPECT TO SEE THOSE

02:07:22.634 --> 02:07:24.436
THINGS IN THE DEFERRED

02:07:24.503 --> 02:07:25.771
MAINTENANCE BUDGET BUCKET --

02:07:25.838 --> 02:07:27.039
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THOSE THINGS

02:07:27.106 --> 02:07:28.240
ON A HIGHER PRIORITY LESTER

02:07:28.307 --> 02:07:30.009
TRYING TO GET THOSE THINGS ARE

02:07:30.075 --> 02:07:38.117
STORED AND BACK OPEN ACCESSIBLE

02:07:38.183 --> 02:07:42.621
CENTER JONES.

02:07:42.688 --> 02:07:44.790
SENATOR STERN READ MY NOTES

02:07:44.857 --> 02:07:45.524
EARLIER SO THE QUESTION IS

02:07:45.591 --> 02:07:46.592
PRETTY MUCH DRIVING ASPECT I DO

02:07:46.658 --> 02:07:47.226
WANT TO JUST RAISE.

02:07:47.292 --> 02:07:49.828
ON THE ACCESS -- AND THE 5% AND

02:07:49.895 --> 02:07:51.296
I MET WITH A GREAT GROUP -- YOU

02:07:51.363 --> 02:07:52.831
YOUNG FOLKS -- FROM MY DISTRICT

02:07:52.898 --> 02:07:53.565
THAT ARE YOU KNOW ARE DOING

02:07:53.632 --> 02:07:55.167
THEIR BEST TO GET IN THE PARKS

02:07:55.234 --> 02:07:56.368
AND ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THEY

02:07:56.435 --> 02:07:57.002
RAISED IS THAT THEY CAN USE THE

02:07:57.069 --> 02:07:57.669
FUNDS TO BUY A VEHICLE BUT THEY

02:07:57.736 --> 02:07:58.404
CAN'T USE THE FUNDS TO PUT GAS

02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:59.772
IN THE VEHICLE.

02:07:59.838 --> 02:08:02.975
SO -- THEN YOU KNOW I'M NOT EVEN

02:08:03.042 --> 02:08:04.877
BE WORK SIR FAIRLY WELL AS

02:08:04.943 --> 02:08:05.778
CENTER STERN SOUNDS LIKE RECESS

02:08:05.844 --> 02:08:06.412
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE NEED TO

02:08:06.478 --> 02:08:09.148
WORK ON I GUESS THE REMAINING

02:08:09.214 --> 02:08:09.882
QUESTION BE.

02:08:09.948 --> 02:08:15.387
YOUR YOUR WORK ON THIS OF

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:16.655
THERE'S A LEGISLATIVE FIX.

02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:18.057
WE CAN PROVIDE -- THROUGH THAT

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:19.158
YOU KNOW THE THE COMPLIES WITH

02:08:19.224 --> 02:08:20.325
THE BOND MAJOR THAN MAYBE THAT'S

02:08:20.392 --> 02:08:21.760
WHAT WE HAD A LOOK AT I'M

02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:22.895
SENATOR I APPRECIATE THOSE --

02:08:22.961 --> 02:08:23.662
THOSE COMMENTS IN THOSE THOUGHTS

02:08:23.729 --> 02:08:24.863
I THINK THIS ISSUE ACTUALLY IS

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:26.365
MUCH BROADER THAN THE DEPARTMENT

02:08:26.432 --> 02:08:27.533
OF PARKS AND RECREATION IT

02:08:27.599 --> 02:08:29.001
APPLIES TO THE ENTIRE BONTA

02:08:29.068 --> 02:08:29.735
MEASURE AND ALL OF THE

02:08:29.802 --> 02:08:31.036
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE RECEIVING

02:08:31.103 --> 02:08:32.871
THE ALLOCATION SO -- I DON'T

02:08:32.938 --> 02:08:33.539
KNOW IF THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:08:33.605 --> 02:08:34.907
FINANCE WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING TO

02:08:34.973 --> 02:08:36.642
THAT BUT I EXPECT THAT THIS WILL

02:08:36.708 --> 02:08:38.210
BE A CONTINUING CONVERSATION AS

02:08:38.277 --> 02:08:39.111
WE LEARN MORE.

02:08:39.178 --> 02:08:40.679
BUT I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO KIND

02:08:40.746 --> 02:08:42.147
OF THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO

02:08:42.214 --> 02:08:43.348
IS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A

02:08:43.415 --> 02:08:44.850
REALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF

02:08:44.917 --> 02:08:46.452
WHAT THE FUNDS CAN BE USED.

02:08:46.518 --> 02:08:47.386
FOR WHAT THEY CAN'T BE IS FOR

02:08:47.453 --> 02:08:48.353
AND THEN WE NEED TO CHANNEL THAT

02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:51.023
BACK OUT TO POTENTIAL APPLICANTS

02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:54.126
AROUND THE STATE -- AN AD THAT --

02:08:54.193 --> 02:08:56.829
YOUR THE ANALOGY THAT THE CAR

02:08:56.895 --> 02:08:59.231
CERTAINLY WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

02:08:59.298 --> 02:09:00.933
IT'S THE THE GAS THAT STILL.

02:09:00.999 --> 02:09:02.701
THE ONGOING DISCUSSION.

02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:03.435
AND THEN THERE WAS MENTION THE

02:09:03.502 --> 02:09:04.703
FUEL OF THE MAINTENANCE OF THE

02:09:04.770 --> 02:09:06.638
VEHICLE AND THEN ALSO.

02:09:06.705 --> 02:09:07.806
YOU KNOW ACCESS TO THE ACTUAL

02:09:07.873 --> 02:09:09.741
PARKS -- AND MISSION TO GET IN

02:09:09.808 --> 02:09:12.978
AND THAT KIND OF THING WAS NOT

02:09:13.045 --> 02:09:15.714
AVAILABLE SO.

02:09:15.781 --> 02:09:16.381
OKAY THERE'S NO ACTUALLY NEED TO

02:09:16.448 --> 02:09:17.349
BE TAKEN OUR STAFF WILL BE

02:09:17.416 --> 02:09:19.651
TALKING WITH YOU ON THESE THIS

02:09:19.718 --> 02:09:21.053
MATTER LET'S MOVE ON THE ISSUE

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:22.254
NUMBER.

02:09:35.467 --> 02:09:36.435
POSITIONS THESE WOULD BE

02:09:36.502 --> 02:09:39.238
ADMINISTRATIVE -- POSITIONS TO

02:09:39.304 --> 02:09:41.206
HELP US -- MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:09:41.273 --> 02:09:42.541
MEETING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS AS

02:09:42.608 --> 02:09:44.076
WE TRANSITION OVER TO THE

02:09:44.143 --> 02:09:45.477
STATE'S NEW STATEWIDE --

02:09:45.544 --> 02:09:46.545
BUDGETING AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEM

02:09:46.612 --> 02:09:49.047
FISCALE WE INITIALLY -- STARTED

02:09:49.114 --> 02:09:50.482
TO TRANSITION IN TWO THOUSAND

02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:53.185
AND SEVENTEEN I THINK SOME OF

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:54.686
THE INITIAL WORK WHAT I THINK WE

02:09:54.753 --> 02:09:55.787
ALWAYS EXPECTED THAT WE THERE

02:09:55.854 --> 02:09:57.189
WOULD BE A ONE TIME SPIKE IN

02:09:57.256 --> 02:09:58.323
WORKLOAD.

02:09:58.390 --> 02:10:00.959
BUT AS WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING --

02:10:01.026 --> 02:10:02.294
WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY

02:10:02.361 --> 02:10:03.829
WITH THE FISCAL DEPARTMENT ALSO

02:10:03.896 --> 02:10:04.963
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO

02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:06.999
IDENTIFY WHICH OF THAT WORKLOAD

02:10:07.065 --> 02:10:08.267
WAS GOING TO BE ON GOING IN

02:10:08.333 --> 02:10:09.168
NATURE.

02:10:09.234 --> 02:10:12.738
WE ARE -- A RATHER IT.

02:10:12.804 --> 02:10:14.940
ACCOUNTING WISE WE HAVE --

02:10:15.007 --> 02:10:16.808
SPECIALIZED ACCOUNTING WORKLOADS

02:10:16.875 --> 02:10:18.343
IF I CAN RUN DOWN A FEW THINGS

02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:20.812
IN SOME CASES WE HAD SOME

02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:22.714
ACTIVITIES THAT WE DID ANNUALLY

02:10:22.781 --> 02:10:24.116
THAT NOW WE'RE HAVING TO DO

02:10:24.183 --> 02:10:24.783
MONTHLY.

02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:26.385
SO ALL OF THIS IS IN THE SPIRIT

02:10:26.451 --> 02:10:28.287
OF HIGHER -- MEETING HIGHER

02:10:28.353 --> 02:10:29.888
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND ALSO

02:10:29.955 --> 02:10:31.690
MORE TRANSPARENCY BUT WE ALSO

02:10:31.757 --> 02:10:33.192
ADMINISTER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

02:10:33.258 --> 02:10:34.526
APPROPRIATIONS FOR VARIOUS

02:10:34.593 --> 02:10:36.862
CONSERVANCY'S BALDWIN HILLS SAN

02:10:36.929 --> 02:10:38.664
JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY.

02:10:38.730 --> 02:10:40.365
AND THE COACHELLA VALLEY --

02:10:40.432 --> 02:10:43.302
MOUNTAINS -- WHEN WE FIRST WE

02:10:43.368 --> 02:10:44.570
FIRST TACKLE IT IS A ONE TIME

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:47.472
ISSUE WE HIRE TEMPORARY STAFF --

02:10:47.539 --> 02:10:49.708
WE ASKED OURADMINISTRATIVE

02:10:49.775 --> 02:10:51.410
STAFF TO DO OVERTIME -- THEY

02:10:51.476 --> 02:10:52.578
ROSE TO THE OCCASION WE PROBABLY

02:10:52.644 --> 02:10:54.746
DID A OVER TEN THOUSAND HOURS OF

02:10:54.813 --> 02:10:56.615
OVERTIME -- ACCOUNTING AND

02:10:56.682 --> 02:10:58.116
BUDGETING OFFICES AND STATE

02:10:58.183 --> 02:10:59.918
AGENCIES TYPICALLY UNDERSTAND

02:10:59.985 --> 02:11:00.819
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

02:11:00.886 --> 02:11:02.854
SEASONAL OVERTIME BUT WE FOUND

02:11:02.921 --> 02:11:04.156
THAT THIS IS NOT SEASONAL.

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:05.791
SO IN THAT CASE WE NEEDED TO

02:11:05.857 --> 02:11:08.961
LOOK FOR SOME ON GOING RESOURCES --

02:11:09.027 --> 02:11:10.429
WE EXPECT THAT THIS WILL

02:11:10.495 --> 02:11:12.898
INCREASE EFFICIENCY OVER TIME

02:11:12.965 --> 02:11:14.466
BUT IT WILL ALSO INCREASE

02:11:14.533 --> 02:11:21.173
TRANSPARENCY -- BUT I THINK

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:21.807
WE'RE WE'RE FEELING PRETTY GOOD

02:11:21.873 --> 02:11:23.108
AN OPTIMA STICK ABOUT IT IT'S

02:11:23.175 --> 02:11:23.709
JUST A MATTER OF MAKING SURE

02:11:23.775 --> 02:11:24.276
THAT WE GET SOME ADDITIONAL

02:11:24.343 --> 02:11:24.943
RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THE ENHANCE

02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:25.544
TRANSPARENCY IN THE OFFICE OF

02:11:25.611 --> 02:11:26.945
FLAVOR OF THE EFFICIENCY

02:11:27.012 --> 02:11:28.447
INCREASE BECAUSE FISCAL THE

02:11:28.513 --> 02:11:30.048
PROMISE OF IT IS.

02:11:30.115 --> 02:11:33.051
IT'S GOING NOWHERE YOU'RE ASKING

02:11:33.118 --> 02:11:35.587
FOR ONE POINT.

02:11:35.654 --> 02:11:37.222
SIX FOREVER AND EVER JUST STAY

02:11:37.289 --> 02:11:38.924
TED TO HAVE.

02:11:38.991 --> 02:11:40.993
I'LL BUY INTO THE TRANSPARENCY

02:11:41.059 --> 02:11:43.629
BUT WE'RE WHEN DO WE REALIZE THE

02:11:43.695 --> 02:11:45.664
EFFICIENCY WHAT WHAT AND WHAT

02:11:45.731 --> 02:11:47.799
THAT MIGHT THAT LOOK LIKE IN THE

02:11:47.866 --> 02:11:49.167
PARKS AND RECREATION.

02:11:49.234 --> 02:11:50.836
DOMAIN.

02:11:50.902 --> 02:11:52.437
SURE UP THANK YOU CHAIR AND

02:11:52.504 --> 02:11:53.839
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE --

02:11:53.905 --> 02:11:54.606
MONIES WILL SHOPS ON THE DAVID

02:11:54.673 --> 02:11:56.308
DIRECTOR FOR ADMINISTRATION FOR

02:11:56.375 --> 02:11:57.109
STATE PARKS.

02:11:57.175 --> 02:11:59.144
SO I THINK THE FIRST THING WE

02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:00.212
HAVE TO REALIZE OFFICE BECAUSE

02:12:00.279 --> 02:12:01.413
IT IS A DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING

02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:03.782
SYSTEM AND CAL STARS IT IS MUCH

02:12:03.849 --> 02:12:05.217
MORE ROBUST IT PROVIDES.

02:12:05.284 --> 02:12:06.451
ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY THAT WAS

02:12:06.518 --> 02:12:08.153
NEVER THERE A CAL STARS AND IT

02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:09.454
MIMICS MUCH MORE MODERN

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:12.157
ACCOUNTING SYSTEM THEN OUR

02:12:12.224 --> 02:12:13.091
LEGACY SYSTEM CAL STARS.

02:12:13.158 --> 02:12:14.326
SAYING THAT THERE WILL BE

02:12:14.393 --> 02:12:16.228
EFFICIENCIES TO BE GAINED --

02:12:16.295 --> 02:12:17.863
THROUGH FISCAL I THINK.

02:12:17.929 --> 02:12:19.598
THE BIGGEST IMPACT OF FISCAL

02:12:19.665 --> 02:12:23.535
WILL BE -- TRANSITION WAY FROM

02:12:23.602 --> 02:12:24.436
DONE WITH CAL STAR INTO MORE OF

02:12:24.503 --> 02:12:26.872
A AN AUTOMATED PAPER FLOW OR

02:12:26.938 --> 02:12:28.540
AUTOMATED WORKFLOW WITH FISCAL

02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:30.208
AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD JUST BE.

02:12:30.275 --> 02:12:31.710
PROCESSING INVOICES THROUGH THE

02:12:31.777 --> 02:12:33.712
STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IN

02:12:33.779 --> 02:12:35.380
THE PAST WE'VE HAD TO SEND OVER.

02:12:35.447 --> 02:12:37.082
REAMS OF PAPER TO SCO THOSE

02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:38.550
WOULD BE AUTOMATED IN FUTURE --

02:12:38.617 --> 02:12:40.252
I THINK AS THE STATE ACCLIMATE

02:12:40.319 --> 02:12:43.021
ITSELF MORE TO THE NEW SYSTEM --

02:12:43.088 --> 02:12:46.325
BUSINESS PROCESSES -- EVOLVE.

02:12:46.391 --> 02:12:47.426
THOSE THINGS WILL BECOME MORE --

02:12:47.492 --> 02:12:51.363
TO APPARENT -- TO THE DEPARTMENT

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:52.731
BUT FOR NOW IT'S A LITTLE.

02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:53.398
WE'RE IN A TRANSITIONAL STATE SO

02:12:53.465 --> 02:12:54.566
THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN QUITE AS

02:12:54.633 --> 02:12:55.634
EFFICIENT AS THEY WILL BE

02:12:55.701 --> 02:12:56.935
ULTIMATELY WITH THIS GIRL I

02:12:57.002 --> 02:12:58.637
THINK ALSO WHAT I MIGHT ADD IN

02:12:58.704 --> 02:13:00.072
TERMS OF FISSION SAYING.

02:13:00.138 --> 02:13:02.674
IS THAT I THINK WHEN WHEN -- IN

02:13:02.741 --> 02:13:04.843
TERMS OF THE PROJECT IF IT'S A

02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:07.045
STATEWIDE PROJECT AND IT ALSO

02:13:07.112 --> 02:13:09.648
CHANGES THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN

02:13:09.715 --> 02:13:10.982
OTHER GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL

02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:12.718
AGENCIES SO THERE ARE OTHER

02:13:12.784 --> 02:13:14.386
EFFICIENCIES THAT WERE NOT

02:13:14.453 --> 02:13:16.421
NECESSARILY POSITION TO SPEAK.

02:13:16.488 --> 02:13:20.592
TO THAT ARE KIND OF OUTSIDE OF

02:13:20.659 --> 02:13:23.562
JUST THE DEPARTMENT.

02:13:23.628 --> 02:13:25.964
HELLO I HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ON

02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:26.331
THIS.

02:13:26.398 --> 02:13:27.733
WE WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS

02:13:27.799 --> 02:13:29.134
AT THIS PROPOSAL AND LOOKING AT

02:13:29.201 --> 02:13:31.503
THE OVERTIME HOURS THAT AND THE

02:13:31.570 --> 02:13:32.537
ACCOUNTING STAFF HAS BEEN

02:13:32.604 --> 02:13:34.673
OCCURRING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:36.308
YEARS AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL

02:13:36.375 --> 02:13:37.576
WORKLOAD TO MEET THE HIGHER

02:13:37.642 --> 02:13:39.444
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS OF THE

02:13:39.511 --> 02:13:40.812
PROPOSAL.

02:13:40.879 --> 02:13:42.013
GENERALLY SEEM REASONABLE BUT

02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:43.482
GOOD OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:13:43.548 --> 02:13:44.916
THE LONG TERM NATURE OF WHEN

02:13:44.983 --> 02:13:48.053
WHEN THOSE EFFICIENCIES WILL

02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:51.623
ACTUALLY MANIFEST OKAY.

02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:52.858
I WOULD HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING ON

02:13:52.924 --> 02:13:55.093
THIS WHEN I FINISH ALTHOUGH HOLD

02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:56.795
UP THE MATTERS MEMBERS WERE

02:13:56.862 --> 02:13:58.663
RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD THIS

02:13:58.730 --> 02:13:59.898
MATTER OPEN.

02:13:59.965 --> 02:14:01.299
AND WITH THAT A MOVE ON TO THE

02:14:01.366 --> 02:14:02.801
CALIFORNIA INDIAN HERITAGE

02:14:02.868 --> 02:14:05.003
CENTER STAFFING THIS IS ISSUE

02:14:05.070 --> 02:14:07.272
NUMBER. SEVENTEEN FOUR HUNDRED

02:14:07.339 --> 02:14:09.107
AND TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND

02:14:09.174 --> 02:14:10.208
DOLLARS FOR THREE POSITIONS.

02:14:10.275 --> 02:14:11.510
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LAST YEAR

BEFORE YOU AND TALKED ABOUT -- A

02:14:15.547 --> 02:14:17.449
PROPOSAL WHICH THE LEGISLATURE

02:14:17.516 --> 02:14:18.617

02:14:19.951 --> 02:14:21.453
CALIFORNIA INDIAN HERITAGE

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:22.754
CULTURAL CENTRE.

02:14:22.821 --> 02:14:24.289
THE INTENTION IS THAT IT WILL

02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:26.124
REPLACE THE CURRENT INDIAN

02:14:26.191 --> 02:14:28.093
MUSEUM WHICH IS CO LOCATE LOCATE

02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:29.995
CO LOCATED WITH OTHER SUPPORT

02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:31.530
HERE I SACRAMENTO -- BUT THE

02:14:31.596 --> 02:14:33.198
FIRST THING THAT WE NEED TO DO

02:14:33.265 --> 02:14:35.000
IS ACQUIRED THE PROPERTY IN WEST

02:14:35.066 --> 02:14:37.736
SACRAMENTO THIS WAS A SITE THAT

02:14:37.803 --> 02:14:40.372
WAS SELECTED BY A TASK FORCE OF

02:14:40.439 --> 02:14:41.706
THAT FROM THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY.

02:14:41.773 --> 02:14:43.442
THEY CHOSE THIS LOCATION BECAUSE

02:14:43.508 --> 02:14:45.744
IT WAS -- HAD CULTURAL -- AND

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:47.078
SACRED SIGNIFICANCE TO THEM IT

02:14:47.145 --> 02:14:48.380
WAS AT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE TWO

02:14:48.447 --> 02:14:50.282
RIVERS SO IT WAS THEIR FIRST

02:14:50.348 --> 02:14:52.851
PARTY SITE SELECTION SO SINCE WE

02:14:52.918 --> 02:14:54.352
WERE LAST BEFORE YOU -- WE'VE

02:14:54.419 --> 02:14:55.454
BEEN WORKING WITH THE CITY OF

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:57.522
WEST SACRAMENTO TO FINALIZE THAT

02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:59.591
SO WE EXPECT THAT LAND TRANSFER

02:14:59.658 --> 02:15:00.892
WAS SO WE WERE SUCCESSFUL NOT.

02:15:00.959 --> 02:15:02.594
AND WE EXPECT THE LAND TRANSFER

02:15:02.661 --> 02:15:04.329
TO OCCUR SOMETIME OVER THE

02:15:04.396 --> 02:15:06.798
SUMMER SO PROGRESS IS BEING MADE --

02:15:06.865 --> 02:15:10.168
ALSO THAT THE WE ALSO SHARED

02:15:10.235 --> 02:15:11.203
WITH YOU AT THAT TIME THAT IT

02:15:11.269 --> 02:15:13.405
WAS THE STATE'S INTENTION TO

02:15:13.472 --> 02:15:14.873
WORK WITH THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY.

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:16.041
TO SEE IF WE COULD SECURE SOME

02:15:16.107 --> 02:15:18.376
PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT SO THAT

02:15:18.443 --> 02:15:19.144
ONE HUNDRED MILLION BECAME A

02:15:19.211 --> 02:15:21.546
NUMBER FOUR MARK MARTIN NORTH OF

02:15:21.613 --> 02:15:23.014
ONE HUNDRED MILLION -- SO THOSE

02:15:23.081 --> 02:15:24.382
CONVERSATIONS ARE CURRENTLY

02:15:24.449 --> 02:15:26.685
HAPPENING THE RESOURCES THAT ARE

02:15:26.751 --> 02:15:27.786
BEING REQUESTED HERE ARE

02:15:27.853 --> 02:15:29.654
RESOURCES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:31.189
IN THE PROPOSAL LAST YEAR BUT

02:15:31.256 --> 02:15:32.991
OUR FIRST HOPE WAS TO BE ABLE TO

02:15:33.058 --> 02:15:34.426
GO AND SEE IF WE COULD WORK OUT

02:15:34.493 --> 02:15:35.961
SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT WITH CITY

02:15:36.027 --> 02:15:38.196
OF A SACRAMENTO -- THAT DID NOT

02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:40.432
MATERIALIZE SO WE'RE HERE ASKING

02:15:40.499 --> 02:15:42.334
FOR THESE RESOURCES I DON'T

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:45.737
UNDERSTAND THE PATROL.

02:15:45.804 --> 02:15:47.272
I'D AT IT I DON'T THE THE MONEY

02:15:47.339 --> 02:15:52.777
FOR PATROLLING THE PROPERTY WE

02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:53.979
HAVEN'T EVEN BUILT.

02:15:54.045 --> 02:15:55.113
WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:56.948
BUILD HOW WHY WOULD WE NEED?

02:15:57.015 --> 02:16:01.419
A OPPOSITION OR OR MAINTAINING.

02:16:01.486 --> 02:16:02.287
ITS.

02:16:02.354 --> 02:16:03.121
SACRED LAND I'LL BUT I'LL GET

02:16:03.188 --> 02:16:03.822
THAT I GET THAT BUT IT'S BEEN

02:16:03.889 --> 02:16:05.090
THERE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS JUST

02:16:05.156 --> 02:16:06.391
BECAUSE THE PARK DISTRICT

02:16:06.458 --> 02:16:08.627
REQUIRES IT WHY ARE WE PAYING

02:16:08.693 --> 02:16:08.994
FOR PATROLLING.

02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:10.996
AND MAINTAINING WHATEVER THAT

02:16:11.062 --> 02:16:12.964
MAY BE I GET THE DEVELOPMENT I

02:16:13.031 --> 02:16:14.299
SEE THAT WE HAVE.

02:16:14.366 --> 02:16:15.600
THAT WOULD BE CONSTRUCTION THIS

02:16:15.667 --> 02:16:19.137
IS MONEY THAT GOES ON FOREVER

02:16:19.204 --> 02:16:20.739
AND EVER.

02:16:20.805 --> 02:16:22.007
THIS -- AT THIS LOCATION IS

02:16:22.073 --> 02:16:22.641
ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF WEST

02:16:22.707 --> 02:16:23.742
SACRAMENTO IN NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S

02:16:23.808 --> 02:16:26.211
NOT A VERY REMOTE LOCATION -- SO

02:16:26.278 --> 02:16:27.379
KIND OF IN THE SPIRIT OF BEING

02:16:27.445 --> 02:16:29.648
GOOD NEIGHBORS THIS PARTICULAR

02:16:29.714 --> 02:16:31.850
PARCEL OF LAND IN THE PAST HAS

02:16:31.917 --> 02:16:34.586
HAD SOME ISSUES IN TERMS OF

02:16:34.653 --> 02:16:35.186
HAVING AN HOMELESS POPULATION

02:16:35.253 --> 02:16:35.921
THERE.

02:16:35.987 --> 02:16:37.355
SO THE CITY OF LOS SACRAMENTO

02:16:37.422 --> 02:16:38.924
HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK TO TRY TO

02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:40.725
RESTORE THAT TO A PLACE WHERE

02:16:40.792 --> 02:16:43.061
LOCAL INDIVIDUALS CAN USE IT FOR

02:16:43.128 --> 02:16:44.462
HIKING AND FISHING.

02:16:44.529 --> 02:16:46.431
SO THEIR HOPE IS THAT WHEN IT

02:16:46.498 --> 02:16:47.732
TRANSFERS OVER TO THE STATE OF

02:16:47.799 --> 02:16:49.100
CALIFORNIA.

02:16:49.167 --> 02:16:51.102
IS THAT IT IS STILL LEFT IN A

02:16:51.169 --> 02:16:53.572
MANNER THAT SAY FOR PEOPLE TO GO

02:16:53.638 --> 02:16:55.574
AND EXPERIENCE THAT -- AND TO

02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:57.776
FINISH AND TO WALK AND JUST

02:16:57.842 --> 02:17:00.045
ENJOY THAT'S THAT OPEN SPACE SO

02:17:00.111 --> 02:17:01.980
THAT WAS PART OF THE COMMITMENT

02:17:02.047 --> 02:17:03.815
OF THIS.

02:17:03.882 --> 02:17:05.617
WOULDN'T THAT BE PART OF YOU

02:17:05.684 --> 02:17:06.685
HAVE A CONSTRUCTION BUDGET THERE

02:17:06.751 --> 02:17:08.320
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BUILD

02:17:08.386 --> 02:17:09.721
SOMETHING IT'S NOT JUST.

02:17:09.788 --> 02:17:12.657
NOTHING THERE WHEN THAT HAPPENS

02:17:12.724 --> 02:17:14.225
THERE'S GOING TO BE NORMAL

02:17:14.292 --> 02:17:16.494
FENCING I PRESUME AND AND THINGS

02:17:16.561 --> 02:17:17.495
LIKE THAT.

02:17:17.562 --> 02:17:18.730
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOOD AT

02:17:18.797 --> 02:17:20.432
WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW BEFORE WE

02:17:20.498 --> 02:17:22.334
START CONSTRUCTION.

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.768
WELL WE'RE STARTING OUR OUR

02:17:23.835 --> 02:17:25.503
PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS OR A

02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:26.838
KIND OF WORKING WITH THE TRIBAL

02:17:26.905 --> 02:17:27.806
COMMITTEE TO DESIGN THE

02:17:27.872 --> 02:17:29.507
COMMUNITY TO DESIGN WHAT EXACTLY

02:18:30.235 --> 02:18:31.636
FRACTION A PORTION OF THAT.

02:18:31.703 --> 02:18:33.304
JUST JUST TO MANAGE THE PROPERTY
