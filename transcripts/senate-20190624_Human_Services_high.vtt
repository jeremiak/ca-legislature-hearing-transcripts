SUFFICIENT TIME TO COMPLETE THE

00:59:25.094 --> 00:59:26.062

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:27.430
EVEN IF EXTENDED WITH THE

SHORTENING AN INVESTIGATION ONLY

CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO TWENTY

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:08.077
ONE DAYS THAT'S WHY WE OFFER

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:09.779

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:10.880

I'VE MET ON THE FACE OF A

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:17.947
NINETEEN DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:20.316
THAT'S LIKE GIVING A WHOLE LOT --

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:21.750
DO YOU MAYBE SPEAK TO THE

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:22.718
PROCESS BY WHICH IN THAT

IN AND PROBABLY SOMEWHAT

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:34.063
UNSTABLE PRECARIOUS SITUATION --

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.364
THAT WHEN SOMEONE CALLS.

THOUSAND A MONTH IN LA IN HIM TO

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:49.411
EACH COUNTY AND?

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:51.914
SO -- SO YOU NOW YOU HAVE SOME

01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:53.816

LIKE KATE MIGHT CULTURES AND

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:56.919
THEY'VE GOT A CALL ON FRIDAY

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:58.020
THAT WE HEARD THE COMPLAINT THAT

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.254
WELL GEE WE CALL NO ONE EVEN

01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:03.025

PROCESS AND HOW YOU CAN GIVE ME

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:08.063
CONFIDENCE THAT THE SOCIAL

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:09.932
WORKER JUDGMENT IS IN TERMS OF

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:10.933
TRYING TO PRIORITIZE A

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.434
SUFFICIENT ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:14.370
STATUTORILY SAY WELL YOU KNOW WE

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:14.737
THINK THESE ARE.

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:19.208
REALLY IMPORTANT KIDS.

01:11:19.274 --> 01:11:19.842
AND THEREFORE YOU SHOULD DO THIS

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:20.709
FIRST.

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.077
THANK YOU I WILL TRY TO ADDRESS

01:11:22.144 --> 01:11:22.945
THOSE QUESTIONS -- KATHY

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:25.147
SINGLING FOR CWD A AGAIN WERE WE

01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:25.848
HAVE CONCERNS ON THE BILL WE

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:26.215
DON'T HAVE IT.

01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:27.016
IT IS A PROCESS CLARIFY

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:27.750
ABSOLUTELY.

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:30.386
SO -- THE SO THERE'S A COUPLE

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:31.854
THINGS THAT I I I WANT TO SAY IN

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.189
RESPONSE TO THAT I THINK -- IF

01:11:34.256 --> 01:11:35.290
YOU PROBABLY HAVE A COUPLE

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:37.026
THINGS GOING ON AS MRS SANTOS

01:11:37.092 --> 01:11:39.228
NOTED THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:41.497
PROCESS WHEN THE CALLS COME IN.

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:43.065
IS TO TRY TO TALK WITH THE

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.533
PERSON AND THAT ASCERTAIN

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.834
WHETHER AN IMMEDIATE OR TEN DAY

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:47.469
RESPONSE IS NEEDED OR IF NO

01:11:47.536 --> 01:11:48.871
RESPONSE IS NEEDED.

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:50.272
AND SO THERE ARE QUESTIONS AND

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:51.640
THERE'S A DECISION MAKING TOOL

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:53.842
THAT WE UTILIZE IN EACH COUNTY

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:55.444
ALONG WITH THAT THAT PARTICULAR

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.312
HOTLINE WORKERS BEST JUDGMENT.

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:59.081
TO TRY TO TRIAGE AND PRIORITIZE

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:01.317
THOSE CASES IT IS A FACT THAT

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:03.585
WERE OPERATING -- IN A SITUATION

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:05.554
WHERE WE THINK AND ARE GOING TO

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:06.588
BE HAVING SOME CONVERSATION

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:07.656
STARTING IN THE FALL WITH THE

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:08.857
ADMINISTRATION.

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:10.059
AND THEN HOPEFULLY BRINGING FROM

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:11.093
CONVERSATIONS HERE TO THE

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.162
LEGISLATURE NEXT YEAR ABOUT THAT

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:14.963
EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM SO I

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:17.066
THINK -- MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:18.701
HAVE THE TOOLS AND THE SOCIAL

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:20.436
WORKERS NECESSARY ON THE GROUND

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:21.737
TO ARM THEM WITH THOSE TOOLS TO

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:22.938
BE ABLE TO MAKE EXCELLENT

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.506
DECISIONS AS TIMELY AS POSSIBLE.

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:25.674
IS REALLY CRITICAL AND IT

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:27.309
DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO THE THE

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:29.244
YOUTH OR AT PART OF THIS BILL I

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:31.346
THINK -- IN THE CONVERSATIONS IT

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:32.915
HAS COME UP THAT THE HOMELESS

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.783
YOUTH ARE THE ONES THAT APPEAR

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.719
TO BE IN THE MOST NEED OF A

01:12:36.785 --> 01:12:38.921
QUICKER RESPONSE AND THAT MAKES

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:39.988
SENSE TO US THAT'S WHY WE'RE

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:40.622
SUGGESTING.

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:42.157
LOOK THE GROUP THAT'S IN THE

01:12:42.224 --> 01:12:43.692
BILL RIGHT NOW IS PRETTY BROAD

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:45.728
AND SO -- IT'S YOU KNOW ANYONE

01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:47.096
WHO'S HAD A PAST EXPERIENCE

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:48.864
ANYONE I THINK THEY'RE SORT OF

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:49.631
THREE GROUPS THAT ARE IN THE

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:51.834
BILL AND SO GIVEN THAT WE KNOW

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.368
THAT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:54.570
RELATED TO THE EMERGENCY

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:55.871
RESPONSE PROCESS THAT WE'RE

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:56.972
GONNA BE HAVING GOOD

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:59.241
CONVERSATIONS WITH -- GIVEN THE

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:00.843
INSTITUTION OF VARIOUS TOOLS AND

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:02.711
DECISION MAKING -- THAT IS

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:03.946
SUPPOSED TO FEED INTO OUR

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:06.115
EFFORTS THAT WERE ABLE TO ANSWER

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:07.916
THOSE QUESTIONS TIMELY.

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:09.651
ON THAT THE TEN DAYS DOES SEEM

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:11.520
QUICK TO W. A FULL INVESTIGATION

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:13.355
AND I THINK THE QUESTION IS DO

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:15.491
YOU RUN THE RISK OF THE WORKER.

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:21.497
IN AT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE JUST

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:23.165
SAYING UNDER GOING TO SAY NO

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:23.732
BECAUSE I CAN'T GET TO YES

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:24.366
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:25.033
BACK THAT UP IF YOU GO TO COURT.

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:25.667
YOU HAVE TO FILE A PETITION AND

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:26.301
YOU HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH IN THAT

01:13:26.368 --> 01:13:26.835
PETITION TO SAY THERE IS

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.303
SOMETHING GOING ON HERE AND I

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:28.937
NEED TO BRING THIS YOUTH IN THE

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:29.772
FOSTER CARE.

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:31.240
AND IF THEY CAN'T GET TO THAT

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:33.575
WITHIN TEN OR EVEN TWENTY ONE

01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:35.711
DAYS -- I THINK INVESTIGATING A

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:37.446
LITTLE BIT TOGETHER WHAT IS WHAT

01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:39.214
HAPPENS AND I THINK THAT MIGHT

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:40.983
BE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IF

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:42.751
THERE'S NOT A RESPONSE AT ALL.

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:45.254
THE LAW IS STRUCTURED TO ME

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.922
HONESTLY IN A WAY WHERE.

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:48.791
THE SOCIAL WORKER HAS TO ACT

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:50.292
WITHIN THAT TWENTY ONE DAYS.

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:52.261
BUT THERE'S NO REAL PRESUMPTION

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:53.896
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DON'T

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:55.164
AND SO THE ANECDOTES THAT WE'VE

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:56.565
HEARD AND I THINK THE ANECDOTES

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.133
WERE PRESENTED TODAY I DIDN'T.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.035
COMMIT THEM TO MEMORY SEEMED IT

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:02.337
SORT OF HAVE THE SORT OF LIMBO

01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:03.605
WHERE YOU'VE MADE THIS REPORT

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:04.907
AND THEN NOTHING HAS HAPPENED

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:06.475
AND THEN THE HANDS ARE TIED TO

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:07.576
DO ANYTHING AND GO ON TO THE

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:08.544
NEXT STEP I MEAN MAYBE THAT'S

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:10.712
SOMETHING TO LOOK AT AND SAY IF

01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:10.913
WE'VE.

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:12.648
HAD THAT TWENTY ONE DAYS AND THE

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.783
ANSWER IS LOOK I'M STILL WORKING

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:15.717
ON IT I'M TRYING TO GET A FAST

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:16.819
AND THERE'S BEEN AN ENGAGEMENT

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:18.387
THAT'S ONE THING IF THERE HASN'T

01:14:18.453 --> 01:14:19.721
BEEN A DECISION MADE.

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:20.956
AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET A HOLD

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:23.025
OF THAT PERSON WITH A COPY AT

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:23.759
THAT WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.360
SEPARATELY -- MAYBE THERE'S

01:14:25.427 --> 01:14:27.129
SOMETHING TO SORT OF PROCEED TO

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:29.998
THE PROCESS WITH THAT THAT.

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:30.465
I DON'T KNOW PUT THAT

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:31.366
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:33.402
BUT ALSO DOESN'T ELEVATE ALL OF

01:14:33.468 --> 01:14:35.003
THOSE PARTICULAR YOUTH IN THAT

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:36.205
GROUP THAT THE BILL CURRENTLY

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:38.740
ELEVATES INTO THAT FASTER OR YOU

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.709
KNOW KIND OF NEXT STEP PROCESS I

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:41.610
FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOME WAYS TO

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:42.411
GET OUT THIS.

01:14:42.477 --> 01:14:43.979
THAT ARE NOT EXACTLY WHAT THE

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:45.714
BILL DOES BUT THAT MAY TAKE INTO

01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:47.382
ACCOUNT THE KIND OF THE WORKLOAD

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:49.117
IMPLICATIONS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

01:14:49.184 --> 01:14:50.285
TO HAVE SOME MORE INFORMATION ON

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:51.820
THE NUMBERS WE DON'T I CAN'T GET

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:53.689
OUT THAT I DON'T I DON'T SEE HOW

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:54.756
TO GET THAT IN THE DATA.

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:55.591
I'M SORRY IT'S KIND OF A LONG

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:58.126
WINDED ANSWER BUT LIKE WE'RE

01:14:58.193 --> 01:14:59.928
TRYING WE SEE THE NEED FOR THESE

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:01.396
USED TO BE SAFE WE DON'T WANT

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:02.631
THESE USED TO BE IN DANGER.

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:03.699
THAT'S I THINK EVERYONE CAN

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:05.167
STIPULATE TO THAT THE QUESTION

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.202
IS WITH IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM

01:15:07.269 --> 01:15:09.238
AND STRUCTURE HOW DO WE MAKE

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:14.743
THAT WORK AND WE JUST DON'T

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:16.211
THINK THIS BOOK LIKE IT THAT IT.

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:16.879
OKAY.

01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:18.213
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL I APPRECIATE

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.181
THE EXPLANATION BECAUSE I THINK

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:20.449
YOU KNOW -- BRIDGE WHAT THE

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:20.983
AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO AND

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:22.217
SPONSORS AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:22.451
TO DO.

01:15:22.517 --> 01:15:23.085
I THINK THE QUESTION IS IS THAT

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:25.988
THE RIGHT SOLUTION AND THAT'S

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:26.755
READ SOMETIMES LIKE OKAY

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:27.890
QUESTION IS IF WE JUST SHORTEN

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:29.791
THE DEADLINE IS THAT GOING TO

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:31.093
WHAT WHAT WHAT'S GOING.

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:32.294
TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHAT A

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:33.629
POTENTIALLY GET ATTEND THE

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:35.063
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT AND THAT'S

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:36.498
WHY I'M TRYING.

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:37.933
TO FIGURE OUT IS SOMEONE WHO

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:38.634
ALSO YOU KNOW IF IT'S ON THE

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.402
BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND YOU KNOW

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:41.169
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:42.104
RESOURCES WERE GETTING THE

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:43.372
COUNTIES AND SO FORTH.

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:56.323
POVERTY.

01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:59.326
ONLY JUST TO ADD THAT -- FIFTEEN

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:00.795
YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A LOCAL.

01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:02.930
ORGANIZER -- TO END HUNGER IN MY

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:05.166
COMMUNITY I ORGANIZED TO TRY TO

01:35:05.232 --> 01:35:06.967
GET THIS PROGRAM AFTER HAVING

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:09.737
MET SENIORS WHO -- TOLD ME THAT

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:10.805
THEY WHEN THEY GOT THEIR

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:12.173
BENEFITS ON THEIR SNAP CARD THEY

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:14.075
HAD TO CHOOSE.

01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:14.608
WHETHER OR NOT TO SELL THE

01:35:14.675 --> 01:35:16.777
BENEFITS SO THAT THEY CAN BUY

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:17.411
FOOD.

01:35:17.478 --> 01:35:17.978
BECAUSE THEY LIVED ON THE

01:35:18.045 --> 01:35:19.313
STREETS IN A COMMUNITY THAT

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.649
DIDN'T HAVE A GROCERY STORE --

01:35:21.715 --> 01:35:24.051
OR GO HUNGRY AND THAT AND THAT

01:35:24.118 --> 01:35:25.719
THE SENIORS TOLD ME THEY'D

01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:28.389
RATHER GO HUNGRY -- THIS IS

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:29.590
HORRIFYING TO ME THAT WE HAD

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:30.958
BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE TO USE AND

01:35:31.025 --> 01:35:33.260
THEY COULDN'T USE THEM -- AND SO

01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:34.995
I ORGANIZE LOCALLY THEY SHOULD

01:35:35.062 --> 01:35:38.165
BE EASY TO FIX. TEN YEARS LATER.

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:39.667
THEY SEE MY OWN COMMUNITY WHERE

01:35:39.733 --> 01:35:41.569
I WAS ORGANIZING STILL DIDN'T

01:35:41.635 --> 01:35:42.470

01:38:06.247 --> 01:38:06.847
OUT.

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:08.916
WHY YOU CAN'T BUY I MEAN YOU'RE

01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:12.286
HOMELESS? TO HAVE A WARM MEAL.

01:38:12.353 --> 01:38:13.887
IT COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE I

01:38:13.954 --> 01:38:14.955

ASSUMING EVEN IF IT WAS FAULTY

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:18.025
THINKING THERE MUST BEEN SOME.

SOME EXPLANATION FOR WHY THEY

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:23.030
LIMITED TRUE TO WHAT KIND OF

01:38:23.097 --> 01:38:24.498
FOOD YOU COULD BUT WHAT IS WHO

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:28.902
ME.

01:38:28.969 --> 01:38:30.404
WHAT I'M THINKING MAY HAVE BEEN

01:38:30.471 --> 01:38:31.939
YEAH I MEAN I THINK JUST BRIEFLY

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:33.874
AT THE PROGRAM ITSELF WAS?

01:38:33.941 --> 01:38:35.409
MADE DURING A TIME WHEN PEOPLE

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:37.578
REALLY ONLY BOUGHT FOOD STORES

01:38:37.645 --> 01:38:38.946
IT'S AN OLD PROGRAM THE PROGRAM

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:40.681
JUST CELEBRATED FIFTY YEARS.

01:38:40.748 --> 01:38:42.249
OF ENDING HUNGER -- REDUCING

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:43.984
HUNGER IN AMERICA -- SO I THINK

01:38:44.051 --> 01:38:46.654
THAT -- HOMELESSNESS REMEMBER I

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.222
I TRY TO TELL YOUNG PEOPLE WE

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:49.990
DIDN'T USED TO HAVE HOMELESSNESS

01:38:50.057 --> 01:38:51.025
LIKE WE HAVE NOW.

01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:52.426
THIS IS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST IN A

01:38:52.493 --> 01:38:54.161
HOMELESS CRISIS BUT REMEMBER

01:38:54.228 --> 01:38:56.130
WHEN WHEN THERE WASN'T PEOPLE

01:38:56.196 --> 01:38:56.864
SLEEPING ON THE STREETS ALL THE

01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:58.999
TIME WE ACTUALLY USED TO HAVE

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:00.134
THAT IN AMERICA AND WE DON'T

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.802
HAVE IT ANYMORE AND AND THE

01:39:01.869 --> 01:39:03.137
PROGRAM RULES FEDERALLY.

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:04.405
THIS OPTION HAS ALWAYS BEEN

01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:06.073
AVAILABLE BUT BUT PEOPLE REALLY

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.808
HAVEN'T HAD TO USE IT -- SO I

01:39:07.875 --> 01:39:09.877
THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF IT AND

01:39:09.943 --> 01:39:11.278
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A COUNTY

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:13.347
I UNDERSTAND WHY COUNTY MIGHT.

01:39:13.414 --> 01:39:15.416
NOT CHOOSE TO YOU KNOW COUNTY

01:39:15.482 --> 01:39:16.684
COW FRESH OFFICE MIGHT NOT

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:19.520
CHOOSE TO ADMINISTER IT IT IS.

01:39:19.586 --> 01:39:20.421
IT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO KIND

01:39:20.487 --> 01:39:21.855
OF CREATE ANIMAL YOU WITH A

01:39:21.922 --> 01:39:23.390
RESTAURANT AND THAT'S NOT REALLY

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:24.692
SOMETHING THAT A COW FRESH

01:39:24.758 --> 01:39:26.293
OFFICE USUALLY DOES.

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:31.632
AND SO -- YOU KNOW -- WHEN THEY

01:39:31.699 --> 01:39:32.533
HAVE SOME SO MUCH WORK TO DO

01:39:32.599 --> 01:39:33.133
JUST TO HELP PEOPLE COMING IN

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:33.434
THE DOORS?

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.402
I I RESPECT THE REASON WHY THEY

01:39:35.469 --> 01:39:37.504
MIGHT CHOOSE NOT TO BUT IT IT IT

01:39:37.571 --> 01:39:39.106
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO IT TO

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:40.774
CREATE A SYSTEM AT THE STATEWIDE

01:39:40.841 --> 01:39:42.242
LEVEL. FOR THEM TO ACCOMMODATE

01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:43.677
THAT WORK RIGHT YOU EITHER TO

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:45.279
STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS SO THAT

01:39:45.346 --> 01:39:46.647
NOT EACH COUNTY HAS TO HAVE A

01:39:46.714 --> 01:39:48.248
POINT PERSON FOR THE RESTAURANTS

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:51.385
THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE.

01:39:51.452 --> 01:39:52.886
YES SENATOR I AM.

01:39:52.953 --> 01:39:53.887
I ALWAYS SAY THERE'S A REASON

01:39:53.954 --> 01:39:56.757
WHY THE WORD NONSENSE EXIST.

01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:57.991
HI THAT WAS THE WORD THAT CAME

01:39:58.058 --> 01:39:59.960
INTO MY HEAD THAT I TRY NOT TO

01:40:00.027 --> 01:40:01.261
USE IT TO BE NOT ONLY IN

01:40:01.328 --> 01:40:02.996
DELICATE IF IDEA IF YOU BEGIN TO

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:04.865
UNDERSTAND IT AND SO THAT COULD

01:40:04.932 --> 01:40:05.599
BE WRONG WITH YOU.

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:06.300
OKAY.

01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:08.268
WELL IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND

01:40:08.335 --> 01:40:10.671
pTO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WHEN YOU

01:40:10.738 --> 01:40:12.339
LOOK AT THE RATIONALE OF WHAT

01:40:12.406 --> 01:40:13.974
THE PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO DO.

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:15.309
ALL OF OUR FOOD PROGRAMS TO

01:40:15.376 --> 01:40:16.677
PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH FOOD.

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:18.779
AND AND YET WE HAVE SO MANY

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:21.014
OBSTACLES THAT PREVENT US FROM

01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:21.882
DOING IT.

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:24.418
AND I HAD NO IDEA THIS ONE NIGHT

01:40:24.485 --> 01:40:26.253
WHEN I RAN FOR A FIRST RAN FOR

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.020
OFFICE.

01:40:27.087 --> 01:40:28.222
I HAD A STUDENT WHO WAS JUST A

01:40:28.288 --> 01:40:29.356
STUDENT MIGHT WHO WORKED IN MY

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:30.724
OWN MY CAMPAIGN.

01:40:30.791 --> 01:40:32.393
AND SHE STARTED TELLING ME ABOUT

01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:34.695
THE CHALLENGES OF USING HER FOOD

01:40:34.762 --> 01:40:37.264
STORE HER CAL FOR S. AND SHE HAD

01:40:37.331 --> 01:40:38.966
TO LEAVE CAMPUS TO GO GET.

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:39.800
SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE THE

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:41.268
CAMPUSES DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL

01:40:41.335 --> 01:40:43.604
WITH CAL FRESH AN EBT CARDS.

01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:45.305
AND SO SHE LOSER PARKING IN THIS

01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:46.507
IS SO THERE WOULD BE SO SHE

01:40:46.573 --> 01:40:47.841
COULDN'T BUY THE CERTAIN THINGS

01:40:47.908 --> 01:40:49.176
ON CAMPUS AND SHE COULDN'T.

01:40:49.243 --> 01:40:50.811
AND YOU HAVE TO LEAVE CAMPUS TO

01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:52.946
COME BACK AND SOLD SO WE BEGAN

01:40:53.013 --> 01:40:54.448
TO SAY WELL LET'S PUT EBT CARDS

01:40:54.515 --> 01:40:56.083
ON CAMPUS WELL OF COURSE

01:40:56.150 --> 01:40:57.885
UNIVERSITY TOLD US IT WOULD COST

01:40:57.951 --> 01:40:58.051
US.

01:40:58.118 --> 01:40:58.986
WHAT ABOUT A QUARTER OF A

01:40:59.052 --> 01:41:00.654
MILLION DOLLARS PER CAMPUS TO

01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:01.955
BUY LITTLE MACHINE?

01:41:02.022 --> 01:41:03.323
AND WE ALL BOUGHT INTO IT FOR

01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:05.058
ABOUT A YEAR UNTIL A ONE OF THE

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:07.728
CAMPUS CAME AND SAID WE DID THAT.

01:41:07.795 --> 01:41:14.601
AND IF SO HOW MUCH IT COSTS IS

01:41:14.668 --> 01:41:17.070
ALL ABOUT. TO A FIFTY DOLLARS I

01:41:17.137 --> 01:41:18.405
MEAN.

01:41:18.472 --> 01:41:19.039
IT.

01:41:19.106 --> 01:41:20.240
AND THEREFORE WE GOT EBT CARDS

01:41:20.307 --> 01:41:21.675
ON EVERY CAMPUS BECAUSE OUR OUR

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:22.409
ANIMALS TOLLS WAS A HALF A

01:41:22.476 --> 01:41:22.943
MILLION DOLLARS A QUARTER

01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:23.744

INFINITE WISDOM THEY MOVED HIM

02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:39.084

02:12:40.619 --> 02:12:41.687
THEY MOVED HIM TO A COUNTY WHERE

02:12:41.753 --> 02:12:42.688
THERE WERE NO SERVICES

02:12:42.754 --> 02:12:44.122
WHATSOEVER TO MEET IS

BASICALLY NONEXISTENT.

02:13:01.006 --> 02:13:03.375

UPON THIS YOUNG MAN KNOWING THAT

02:13:22.794 --> 02:13:24.529
