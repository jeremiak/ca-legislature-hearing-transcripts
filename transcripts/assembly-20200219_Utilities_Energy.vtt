AFFORDABILITY OF ELECTRICITY

00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:59.117
AND CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY. TO

00:31:59.183 --> 00:32:01.352
ELECTRIFY SECTORS WITH HIDES.

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:03.554
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE

00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:04.622
ELECTRIFICATION OF

00:32:04.689 --> 00:32:06.291
TRANSPORTATION BUILDINGS COULD

00:32:06.357 --> 00:32:07.725
OFFER THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

00:32:07.792 --> 00:32:11.195
PATH. TO DEEP THE CARBONIZATION

00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:12.263
A RECENT REPORT BY THE

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S WHO'S

00:32:14.132 --> 00:32:15.466
WITH US TODAY CAUTIONS THAT

CALIFORNIA'S RATES ARE

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:18.870
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN MOST

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:21.773
OTHER STATES. HI ELECTRICITY

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:23.241
PRICES COULD SLOW TRANSITION

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:25.777
AWAY FROM GASOLINE DIESEL AND

00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:28.646
NATURAL GAS OF THE COSTA POWER

00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:30.782
ELECTRICAL ALTERNATIVES BECOMES

00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:33.584
PROHIBITIVE. OVER THE LAST

00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:35.219
DECADE THE ANNUAL EMISSIONS

00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:37.488
FROM THE ELECTRIC SECTOR HAVE

00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:40.358
DECLINED BY ABOUT FORTY MILLION

00:32:40.425 --> 00:32:42.527
METRIC TONS OR 40% THOSE

00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:43.761
REDUCTIONS HAVE BEEN THE

00:32:43.828 --> 00:32:45.730
PRIMARY DRIVER OF STATEWIDE

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:46.564
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:48.499
REDUCTIONS FROM THE ELECTRIC

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:50.802
SECTOR WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY

00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:52.637
15% OF CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL

00:32:52.704 --> 00:32:55.473
EMISSIONS. DECLINING PRICES THE

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.709
RENEWABLES ARE PROVIDING THE

00:32:57.775 --> 00:32:58.943
MEANS TO THE CARBON EYES THE

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.411
ELECTRIC SECTOR AND

00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:03.181
CORRESPONDINGLY SECTORS WHICH

00:33:03.247 --> 00:33:07.919
MUCH HIGHER. EMISSIONS PROFILE

00:33:07.985 --> 00:33:09.754
SUCH AS THE TRANSPORTATION

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:12.957
SECTOR AND RESIDENTIAL. HOWEVER

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:14.492
THERE HAVE BEEN THERE HAS BEEN

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:15.827
A DISTURBING DISTURBING

00:33:15.893 --> 00:33:17.528
INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:19.897
BEYOND THE RATE OF INFLATION IN

00:33:19.964 --> 00:33:21.532
THE RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL AND

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:23.368
INDUSTRIAL SECTORS CALIFORNIA'S

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:25.103
ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:26.637
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN MOST

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:28.740
OTHER STATES. RETAIL

00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:29.874
ELECTRICITY RATES ARE HIGHER

00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:31.442
DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:32.543
INCLUDING THE DECLINING

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.345
ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION AND

00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:36.381
COSTS FOR VARIOUS STATE

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:39.250
MANDATED PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:33:39.317 --> 00:33:41.386
EMBEDDED ELECTRICITY RATES.

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:42.987
DECLINING CONSUMPTION EQUATES

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:45.123
TO FIX COST BEING SPREAD OVER A

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:47.158
SMALLER BASE OF CUSTOMERS.

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:48.626
UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS PER

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:49.861
PRECIPITATING INCREASES IN

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:51.896
ELECTRICITY RATES AND WHAT

00:33:51.963 --> 00:33:53.731
ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE TO REVERSE

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:57.201
THE UPWARD TREND IS VITAL. IT

00:33:57.268 --> 00:33:58.636
IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR US TO

00:33:58.703 --> 00:33:59.937
UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS

00:34:00.004 --> 00:34:01.205
THAT INCREASE ELECTRICITY

00:34:01.272 --> 00:34:03.474
PRICES HAVE ON RESIDENTIAL AND

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:05.543
COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AND OUR

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.678
ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR CRITICAL

00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:10.148
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOALS.

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:12.417
THROUGH GREATER ELECTRIFICATION.

00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:14.051
THE WITNESSES WE HAVE COMING

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:15.686
FOR BEFORE US TODAY ARE WELL

00:34:15.753 --> 00:34:17.288
POSITIONED TO ADDRESS THESE

00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:20.691
CRITICAL ISSUES. LET ME FIRST-

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:21.626
TURN TO MEMBERS OF THE

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:23.828
COMMITTEE- TO SEE IF THEY WOULD

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:25.630
LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:27.465
COMMENTS BEFORE I CALL THE

00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:29.934
PANEL FORWARD- BUT I DO THINK

00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:31.936
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WE TAKE

00:34:32.003 --> 00:34:34.105
THIS ISSUE UP EARLY AT OUR

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:35.840
SESSION BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:37.508
LEGISLATION MOVING FORWARD WE

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:38.543
WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT

00:34:38.609 --> 00:34:39.844
WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF ITS

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:42.280
IMPACT ON RATE PAYERS BECAUSE I

00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:44.482
THINK AS WE'VE HEARD. AND

00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:46.851
HERBAL HOUSING OF SIDE OF THE

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:49.353
WORLD THE RENTS ARE TOO DARN

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.457
HIGH. THAT'S MY EDIT. THE

00:34:52.523 --> 00:34:53.758
ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE TOO DARN

00:34:53.825 --> 00:34:56.928
HIGH. AND SO IF- THERE ANY

00:34:56.994 --> 00:34:58.963
MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN

00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.864

RECENT. LA REPORT ON THE

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:19.584
ELECTRICITY GENERATION IT'S

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.619
MADE CLEAR THAT THESE HIGH

00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:23.621
UTILITY RATES AND PRICES ARE

00:35:23.688 --> 00:35:24.889
GOING TO BE A BARRIER FOR

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:27.892
FUTURE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. R.

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:30.027
G. H. G. TOOK TARGETS ARE VERY

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:32.129
AMBITIOUS AND IT'S CRITICAL

00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:34.131
THAT IS A STATE WE MEET OUR

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:36.400
CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. AS THESE

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:39.003
UTILITY RATES INCREASE THAT

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.506
LIKELIHOOD DECREASES DURING OUR

00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:44.809
LAST HEARING THE CPUC PRESIDENT

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:47.278
TO MERRY BELL BOETTCHER. STATED

00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:49.647
THAT FOR EVERY BILLION AND

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:51.015
WHILE FARM WITH WILD FIRE

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:53.084
MITIGATION COST RATE PAYER

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.853
RATES WILL INCREASE BY 7%

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.123
THAT'S FRIGHTENING. NOT ONLY

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.025
THAT BUT UTILITIES RATES HAVE

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:02.760
ALSO BEEN GOING UP FASTER THAN

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:05.630
INFLATION. ACCORDING TO THE

00:36:05.696 --> 00:36:07.732
PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE

00:36:07.798 --> 00:36:10.868
RESIDENTIAL RATES HAVE RISEN.

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:13.170
31% BETWEEN TWO TWO THOUSAND

00:36:13.237 --> 00:36:14.672
NINE AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:15.606
HIGHER THAN THE CONSUMER PRICE

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:20.545
INDEX OF 19% LAST YEAR WE VOTED

00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:24.515
AND POUNCED. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:26.117
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I

00:36:26.183 --> 00:36:27.585
TRUST IN THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:31.589
GOVERNMENT TO. HOLD THE PGA ANY

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.724
TO THEIR END OF THE BARGAIN. I

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:35.126
KNOW THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS

00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:37.662
ARE NOT EASY BUT WE HAVE TO

00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:40.031
FIND MIDDLE GROUND ONE THAT

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:41.399
INSURERS WE CAN MEET OUR

00:36:41.465 --> 00:36:44.702
CLIMATE GOALS AND ONE THAT DOES

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:46.270
NOT BURDEN OUR RATE PAYERS I

00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:47.905
LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:51.275
CONVERSATION. THANK YOU DOCTOR

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:55.646
QUIRK. I'M GOING TO SOUND A

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:56.881
LITTLE BIT LIKE A SKEPTICAL

00:36:56.948 --> 00:37:00.551
REPUBLICAN ON THIS BUT- LOOK

00:37:00.618 --> 00:37:02.920
THE C. E. C. DECIDED AWHILE

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:05.423
AGO. THAT THEY WERE GOING TO

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:07.992
DEMAND ROOFTOP SOLAR. ON NEW

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:09.961
BUILDINGS AND I THINK THAT WAS

00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:11.963
A MISTAKE. IT IS MUCH MORE

00:37:12.029 --> 00:37:15.499
EXPENSIVE THAN SIMPLY WHAT

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:17.001
WE'RE PLANNING TO DO ANYWAY

00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:20.004
WHICH IS TO HAVE FAILED- WELL

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:20.638
FOR TROUT THERE'S ALREADY

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:23.874
MANDATE. TO GO A 100% RENEWABLE

00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:26.010
WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO HAVE AN

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:28.946
ADDITIONAL MANDATE. AND ROOFTOP

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:29.981
SOLAR SIMPLY MUCH MORE

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:32.183
EXPENSIVE THAN HAVING A SOLAR

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.719
FARM- IT'S SEVERAL TIMES MORE

00:37:34.785 --> 00:37:38.022
EXPENSIVE. FURTHER YOU THEN

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:39.523
HAVE THE PEOPLE ARE BUYING NEW

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:44.362
HOMES BY AND- MUCH MORE- HIGH

00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:46.731
INCOME THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON

00:37:46.797 --> 00:37:48.766
GETTING A BREAK ON THE FACT

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:50.434
THAT THEY HAVE SOLAR. AND

00:37:50.501 --> 00:37:52.003
THAT'S BEING PAID FOR OUT OF

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:54.605
THE GENERAL RATE CASE. I CAN'T

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:56.674
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:59.243
THAT IS BUT I WILL BE ASKING

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.379
THE PUBLIC ADVOCATES WILL COME

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:03.280
UP HERE TO LOOK INTO THAT

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:05.583
BECAUSE IT IS INCREASING COST.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.918
A SECOND THING WE'RE DOING IS

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:08.753
WE'RE DOING A LOT OF ENERGY

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:10.488
CONSERVATION BURKE WORK ON

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:13.057
BUILDINGS AND YET. WHEN WE LOOK

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:15.426
AT THAT WORK IT DOESN'T PAY

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:18.229
OFF. IT SIMPLY DOESN'T RESEARCH

00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:21.032
HAS BEEN DONE AT UC BERKELEY AM

00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:24.435
I T. AND CHICAGO. AS WELL AS

00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:26.604
OUR REPORTS DONE HERE WHICH

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:28.305
I'VE LOOKED AT IN THE PAST I

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:29.940
DIDN'T COME PREPARED TO BRING

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:31.709
ALL THOSE REPORTS WITH ME BUT I

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:36.414
COULD- WHICH SIMPLY SHOW. THAT

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.282
THE ESTIMATES OF. ARE NOT AT

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:40.084
ALL CLOSE TO THE ACTUAL SAVINGS

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:41.218
IN THE ACTUAL SAVINGS ARE

00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:43.454
SEVERAL TIMES LESS BILL FOR

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.856
ELECTRIC AND GAS USAGE. SO

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:47.825
WE'RE JUST NOT SPENDING OUR

00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:49.326
MONEY RIGHT AND IF WE'RE GOING

00:38:49.393 --> 00:38:50.528
TO ACHIEVE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS

00:38:50.594 --> 00:38:52.096
GOALS WE REALLY OUGHT TO

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:53.664
RETRIEVE THEM IN THE CHEAPEST

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:55.032
WAY POSSIBLE AND THAT DOESN'T

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:56.834
MEAN ROOFTOP SOLAR SHOULD BE

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:59.503
MANDATED. IT MEANS WE BUILT

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.605
MORE ENERGY FARMS AT SOLAR

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:03.908
ENERGY FARMS AND IF WE'RE GONNA

00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:06.711
DO OUR ENERGY CONSERVATION WE

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:07.878
OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH

00:39:07.945 --> 00:39:09.680
MONEY IT ACTUALLY SAVES WE'RE

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:11.882
SPENDING BILLIONS ON THAT AND

00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:14.452
IT'S NOT GETTING THE PAY OFF. I

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:15.986
CAN'T TELL YOU WHY BUT THE

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:18.956
NUMBERS ARE THERE AND IT'S NOT

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:22.793
SO. THERE IT IS. THANK YOU. OUR

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.161
WILL IF THERE ARE NO OTHER

00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:26.263

JUST GONNA OFFER SOME HIGH

00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:15.713
LEVEL COMMENTS AND SOME SUMMARY

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.081
COMMENTS BASED ON SOME OF THE

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:18.149
WORK THAT WE DID IN THE REPORT

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:19.316
THAT YOU REFERENCED EARLIER

00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:20.484
MISTER CHAIR THAT WE RELEASED

00:40:20.551 --> 00:40:22.486
IN JANUARY WHAT'S REALLY THE

00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:23.821
PRIMARY FOCUS OF THAT REPORT

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:25.022
WAS ASSESSING KIND OF WHAT WE

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:26.757
KNOW AND DON'T NOW ABOUT THE

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:27.691
AFFECTS OF THE STATE'S MAJOR

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:28.893
CLIMATE POLICIES IN THE

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:31.061
ELECTRICITY SECTOR- AND I'LL BE

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:33.697
SPEAKING TO A JUST A PIECE OF

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:35.833
THAT- WHICH WE TOUCH ON TOWARDS

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:36.934
THE END OF THE REPORT. ON TO

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:39.170
SEE RATES- BUT AS WE CANNOT

00:40:39.236 --> 00:40:42.339
START THIS DISCUSSION I JUST-

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:43.641
AGAIN SIR SUMMARIZING SOME OF

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:45.075
THE HIGH LEVEL CONTEXT WHICH I

00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:46.277
THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:48.646
DISCUSSION- AS YOU MENTION

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:50.681
MISTER CHAIR ELECTRICITY HAS

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:52.817
BEEN THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF

00:40:52.883 --> 00:40:53.350
EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN THE

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:54.752
STATES. AT THE STATE HAS MEDI

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:56.754
YOU TWENTY TWENTY GOAL A FEW

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:59.190
YEARS EARLY AND IF YOU LOOK

00:40:59.256 --> 00:41:01.125
BACK OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:02.593
ESSENTIALLY KIND OF ALL OF

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.395
THOSE REDUCTIONS HAVE BEEN FROM

00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:06.931
ELECTRICITY GENERATION- AND IN

00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:08.899
PARTICULAR A CHANGES IN THE MIX

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:15.172
OF ELECTRICITY. SOURCES OF IS

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:15.773
TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY. NOW

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.041
WHEN YOU LOOK OUT TOWARDS THE

00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:17.575
TWENTY THIRTY GOALS IN THE

00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:20.477
BEYOND THAT THOSE. MORE AND SO-

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:21.712
YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA REQUIRE

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:23.514
REDUCTIONS FROM OTHER SECTORS

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:24.915
BEYOND JUST ELECTRICITY AND

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:25.449
THAT'S WHY WE THINK IT'S

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:27.184
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT-

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:28.519
EMISSION REDUCTIONS ACROSS

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:31.488
DIFFERENT SECTORS. YOU KNOW A

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:32.656
LECTURE CITY AS WELL AS

00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:34.525
TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDINGS

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:36.060
AND IN PARTICULAR THIS QUESTION

00:41:36.126 --> 00:41:38.095
OF. ELECTRIFICATION AND THAT

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.697
BEING ONE OF THE- POTENTIAL

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:41.198
PATHWAYS TO ACHIEVING SOME OF

00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:43.267
THE MORE AMBITIOUS. REDUCTIONS

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:44.802
AND WHAT ROLE KIND OF OUR OUR

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:45.836
POLICIES ELECTRICITY SECTOR

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:48.038
PLAY AN INDYCAR NICE IN THOSE

00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:49.940
OTHER SECTORS. AND THEN THAT

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:52.276
BRINGS US TO. THE ISSUE OF THE

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:53.844
HIGHLIGHT TRICITY RATES AND WE

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:55.713
DO THINK THAT IT COULD BE- ONE

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:58.215
BARRIER TO ACHIEVING THOSE MORE

00:41:58.282 --> 00:41:59.350
AGGRESSIVE EMISSION REDUCTION

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:02.152
GOALS. RATES ARE YOU'LL HEAR

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:03.220
FROM A PROFESSOR BUSH NOW ON

00:42:03.287 --> 00:42:04.755
SOME OF THEIR GOOD WORK IN

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:06.724
LOOKING AT RATES AND

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.292
ELECTRICITY RATES BEING QUITE A

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:10.628
BIT HIGHER THAN. THE MARGINAL

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:11.962
COST OF PRODUCING ELECTRICITY

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:12.963
INCLUDING SOME OF THE

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.797
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS

00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:15.399
ASSOCIATED WITH. DOING THAT AND

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:16.934
WE THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:17.935
CONSIDERATION WHEN THINKING

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:19.870
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT AN

00:42:19.937 --> 00:42:21.205
APPROPRIATE LEVEL FOR SORT OF A

00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:22.706
RETAIL RATE ON TURN IN TERMS OF

00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:24.875
CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR IS. AND

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:26.644
HOW IT MIGHT SERVICE BARRIER TO

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:27.978
EMISSION REDUCTIONS THERE'S A

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:30.681
LOT OF REASONS WHY RATES RETAIL

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:33.117
RATES ARE HIGHER THAN OTHER

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:34.618
STATES AND HIGHER THAN SOCIAL

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:36.086
MARGINAL COST SOME OF THOSE.

00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:37.621
THE BIG I THINK SOME OF THE BIG

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:39.189
POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS ARE HOW

00:42:39.256 --> 00:42:40.758
WE TREAT FIX COSTS INCLUDING

00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:42.626
THOSE AND VOLUMETRIC

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:45.496
ELECTRICITY RATES. THE OTHER IS

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:47.464
STATE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES AND

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:49.500
THOSE ARE BUILT INTO BIOMETRIC

00:42:49.566 --> 00:42:51.969
RATE SO WE DON'T HAVE A REALLY

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:53.137
CLEAR BREAKDOWN OF ALL THE

00:42:53.203 --> 00:42:54.371
DIFFERET FACTORS AND AGREE TO

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:55.339
WHICH THEY CONTRIBUTE BUT-

00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:56.740
THOSE ARE. SOME OF THE

00:42:56.807 --> 00:42:59.009
DIFFERENT FACTORS- AND SNOW

00:42:59.076 --> 00:42:59.977
THAT THE EFFECTS OF THOSE

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:02.413
HIGHER RATES- CAN HAVE ECONOMIC

00:43:02.479 --> 00:43:03.847
AFFECTS YOUR DISCOURAGING

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.416
VALUABLE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:06.483
FROM BOTH HOUSEHOLDS AND

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.452
BUSINESSES. BUT ALSO YOU KNOW

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:09.586
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS WERE

00:43:09.653 --> 00:43:11.055
TALKING ABOUT US AND SERVING AS

00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:12.122
A BARRIER TO ELECTRIFICATION

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:16.760
OF. ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR-

00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:18.963
BUILDINGS IMPLANTS IS. SO I

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:20.230
THINK THE MOST CHALLENGING

00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:21.699
ASPECT OF THIS ISSUE IS YOU

00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:24.068
KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT- AND

00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:25.269
YOU KNOW IT I THINK THERE'S

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:26.937
GENERALLY NOT A LOT OF EASY

00:43:27.004 --> 00:43:28.105
ANSWERS SO THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:29.039
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:31.375
DECISIONS I THINK IN FRONT OF

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:33.010
YOU AS YOU. LOOK AT THIS ISSUE.

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:34.945
I'M I THINK GENERALLY

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:37.081
ENCOURAGING RATE STRUCTURES

00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:39.016
WHERE THE RETAIL RATE THAT A

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:40.584
CONSUMER BUSINESS FACES THAT

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:42.853
REFLECTS. THAT KIND OF MARGINAL

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.721
COST OF GENERATING THE

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:45.589
ELECTRICITY INCLUDING THE-

00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:46.523
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS IS KIND

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.792
OF A GOOD- OVERALL APPROACH AND

00:43:48.859 --> 00:43:50.160
THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW TO

00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:52.129
SET RATES NOW THE CHALLENGE. IS

00:43:52.196 --> 00:43:53.897
IF THE STATE MOVES IN THAT

00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:54.465
DIRECTION THEY'RE ALL THESE

00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:56.633
OTHER. COSTS RELATED TO FIX

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.002
COSTS FOR DISTRIBUTION AND

00:43:58.068 --> 00:43:59.203
TRANSMISSION LINES AS WELL AS

00:43:59.269 --> 00:44:00.838
STATE PROGRAM COSTS AND- IF YOU

00:44:00.904 --> 00:44:02.306
DON'T INCLUDE THOSE IN THE

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:03.674
ELECTRICITY RATES THAN THAT

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:04.908
MONEY IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE.

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:06.143
RAISED IN SOME OTHER WAY AND

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.312
THAT'S WHERE YOU YOU FACE SOME

00:44:08.379 --> 00:44:08.912
DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT HOW

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.948
TO DO THAT- YOU KNOW COUPLE THE

00:44:11.015 --> 00:44:13.150
OPTIONS I THINK THAT YOU MIGHT

00:44:13.217 --> 00:44:14.318
END UP HEARING ABOUT OUR- FIX

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:17.354
CHARGES. SO YOU KNOW. A CARD

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:18.889
XIN DOLLARS PER MONTH THAT IS

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:21.158
NOT BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF

00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:22.059
ELECTRICITY CONCERT YOU

00:44:22.126 --> 00:44:23.527
CONSUME. IS KIND OF ON AVENUE

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:24.695
THAT I THINK YOU'LL HEAR A LOT

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:26.563
OF OTHER STATES. USE ANOTHER

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:30.134
UTILITIES USE TO CUT RECOVER

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.402
SOME OF THE FIXED COSTS SO THAT

00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:32.302
WE THINK THAT'S- WORTH

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:33.837
EXPLORING THERE ARE TRADE OFFS

00:44:33.904 --> 00:44:34.838
ASSOCIATE WITH DOING THAT BUT

00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:36.840
IT. IT'S WORTH EXPLORING. AND

00:44:36.907 --> 00:44:38.242
THEN THE OTHER I THINK JUST

00:44:38.308 --> 00:44:40.210
BROAD CATEGORY OF- KIND OF

00:44:40.277 --> 00:44:41.278
SOLUTIONS ARE WORTH EXPLORING

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:43.013
AS- LOOKING AT OTHER FUNDING

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.516
SOURCES FOR SOME OF THE STATE.

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:48.619
PROGRAM COSTS AGAIN. THOSE

00:44:48.685 --> 00:44:49.620
THERE'S NOT EASY ANSWERS THERE

00:44:49.686 --> 00:44:51.321
AND THERE ARE CLEAR TRADE OFFS

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:52.222
ASSOCIATED WITH USING OTHER

00:44:52.289 --> 00:44:54.324
FUNDING SOURCES LIKE. CAP AND

00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:55.759
TRADE DOLLARS GENERAL FUND

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:58.262
DOLLARS- AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S

00:44:58.328 --> 00:45:00.030
GONNA TAKE A LOT OF KIND OF

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:01.131
CAREFUL AND THOUGHTFUL

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.833
CONSIDERATION WHEN THOSE TRADE

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.601
OFFS- BUT WE DO THINK IT'S AN

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:05.702
IMPORTANT ISSUE TO BE THINKING

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:06.770
ABOUT AND- AND LOOKING AND

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:08.839
STILL AND CONTINUING TO

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:10.741
EXPLORE. SO I'LL IN MY COMMENTS

00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:14.611
THERE. WELL WE'LL HEAR FROM ALL

00:45:14.678 --> 00:45:15.546
OF YOU AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK

00:45:15.612 --> 00:45:16.513
WITH QUESTIONS FROM THE

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.648
COMMITTEE WANTS ALL THE

00:45:17.714 --> 00:45:22.252
PRESENTATIONS REMAIN. ALL RIGHT

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:23.687
THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:25.289
OPPORTUNITY I I'M GONNA END UP

00:45:25.355 --> 00:45:27.825
ECHOING A LOT OF WHAT'S ALREADY

00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:30.294
BEEN SENT BY ROSS AND SEVERAL

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.862
OF THE MEMBERS- SO I'LL LET ME

00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:33.197
BE ABLE TOGO A LITTLE QUICKER.

00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:34.264
SO I WAS GONNA TRY TO PUT THIS

00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:35.666
IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE

00:45:35.732 --> 00:45:38.035
POLICY IN THE STATE- AS WE

00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:39.103
WORRY HEARD THIS IS A GREAT

00:45:39.169 --> 00:45:40.704
OVERSIMPLIFICATION BUT- TENSION

00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:42.973
HE- DISTILLING DOWN THE CLIMATE

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.341
PLAN TO THESE TWO STEPS WERE

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:46.410
GOING TO TRY TO ZERO OR- PLEASE

00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:47.878
TAKE. A LOT OF THE CARBON OUT

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:50.247
OF THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR- AND

00:45:50.314 --> 00:45:52.416
THEN. TRY TO TRANSITION ALL

00:45:52.483 --> 00:45:53.784
THESE OTHER SOURCES WHICH ARE

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:55.786
GOING TO BE HIGHER CARBON

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:58.322
INTENSIVE INTO ELECTRICITY

00:45:58.388 --> 00:45:59.456
WHICH BY THEN WOULD BE.

00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:01.625
RELATIVELY CLEAN RELATIVELY LOW

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:03.093
CARBON AND AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.929
THAT SORT OF THE MOST. DOMINANT

00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:08.465
PARTS OF OUR CLIMATESTRATEGY.

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:10.134
WE'VE ALREADY HEARD WE'VE WE'VE

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.401
MADE GREAT STRIDES ON THE

00:46:11.468 --> 00:46:14.838
ELECTRICITY SIDE- AND- WE'VE

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:16.173
ACHIEVED OUR TWENTY THIRTY

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.274
GOALS ALREADY THAT'S ALL COME

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:19.243
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM

00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:20.177
REDUCTIONS IN THE ELECTRIC

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:22.446
SECTOR- THE TRANSPORTATION

00:46:22.513 --> 00:46:24.181
SECTOR THE INDUSTRIAL AND

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:25.315
NATURAL GAS SECTOR THAT'S THE

00:46:25.382 --> 00:46:26.850
GREEN AND YELLOW BARS THERE.

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:29.019
REALLY HAVEN'T- DECLINE MUCH IN

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:30.821
THE LAST DECADE AND THAT'S

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:32.222
WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO START

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:33.157
TO MAKE ME YOUR HEAD WILL PAY

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:34.625
IF WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GET TO

00:46:34.691 --> 00:46:36.860
OUR TWENTY THIRTY. ON GOALS. SO

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:37.961
THAT'S BACK THE CHALLENGES

00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:40.430
WE'VE HEARD IS. REALLY STEP

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:43.300
ONE- AS WE PUSH MORE ON STEP

00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:45.802
ONE IT MAKES STEP TO A PARTNER

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:51.475
WE ARE. ALL THE FIREMEN AND

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:52.042
OTHER POLICY CHOICES WE'VE

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.843
ALREADY ABOUT OF THEM. ARE

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:53.377
THEY'VE CONTINUE TO PUT UP

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:55.212
PRESSURE ELECT PRICES. ARE

00:46:55.279 --> 00:46:56.880
PARTICULARLY VARIABLE ACTRESS

00:46:56.947 --> 00:46:58.882
YOU PRICES ALL GET INTO- AND

00:46:58.949 --> 00:46:59.983
THAT LEAVES US IN A WEIRD

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.285
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE ELECTRICITY

00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:03.587
IS BY FAR THE CLEANEST OPTION

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:06.056
FOR OF FUEL. BUT IT'S ALSO FROM

00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:07.191
A CONSUMER STANDPOINT BY FAR

00:47:07.257 --> 00:47:09.693
THE MOST EXPENSIVE OPTION AND

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.894
SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO GET

00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:13.263
PEOPLE. TO EMBRACE ELECTRICITY

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:16.466
AS A AS A- SOURCE OF FUEL FOR

00:47:16.533 --> 00:47:17.734
OTHER SECTORS WERE REALLY SORT

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:19.269
OF. CREATING HEADWINDS FOR

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:21.038
OURSELVES BY MAKING IT VERY

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:22.005
COMMERCIALLY UNATTRACTIVE WITH

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:23.974
THESE PRICES. WHY ARE PRICES

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:25.108
HIGHER WE HAVE THE PUBLIC

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:26.710
ADVOCATE'S OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:29.613
THAT THE MORE BUT I PUT THIS UP

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.048
HERE IT'S MUCH MORE. THAN I

00:47:31.114 --> 00:47:32.382
HAVE TIME TO DESCRIBE THIS IS

00:47:32.449 --> 00:47:34.351
FROM A COLLEAGUES ELECTRICITY

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:36.653
BILL WHERE. IT'S BROKEN OUT BY

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.488
SOME ROUGH SECTORS AND ONE OF

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:39.556
THE POINTS HERE IS THAT YOU CAN

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.458
SEE THE GREEN. RED BARS ARE

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.360
GROWING- OVER THE LAST HALF

00:47:43.427 --> 00:47:45.662
DECADE THOSE ARE ESSENTIALLY

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:46.863
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS WHAT

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.098
ROSTER FOR TWO IS FIXED COSTS.

00:47:48.165 --> 00:47:49.499
THESE ARE COSTS THAT DON'T GO

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:54.671
DOWN WHEN. PEOPLE OF. IT'S ALL

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:55.305
ARE ON THE ROOFTOPS OR DON'T GO

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:57.741
WHEN. CHARGING EVEY- THEY ARE A

00:47:57.808 --> 00:48:00.010
CLASS OF CONNECTIVITY NOT COSTS

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:03.380
OF USAGE- AND- THE PEOPLE WHO

00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:04.982
REGULATE UTILITIES ACROSS THE

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.116
WORLD OF HER STRUGGLED WITH THE

00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:07.417
RIGHT WAY TO TRY TO. RECOVER

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:08.585
THESE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:10.854
ALONG WITH THE COST OF ACTUALLY

00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:11.455
PRODUCING THE ELECTRICITY THE

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:13.223
PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING- AND IT

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:14.958
COMES DOWN TO IS ROSS MENTIONED

00:48:15.025 --> 00:48:16.426
THIS BALANCE BETWEEN. TRYING TO

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:17.361
RECOVER SOME OF THE COST

00:48:17.427 --> 00:48:18.462
THROUGH A MONTHLY SORT OF

00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:21.164
SUBSCRIPTION FEE- THAT YOU PAY

00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:22.733
JUST FOR CONNECTIVITY FOR THE

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:24.801
INFRASTRUCTURE BASICALLY-

00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:26.637
THAT'S ON- THAT'S NOT LINKED TO

00:48:26.703 --> 00:48:27.571
THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:28.639
YOU'RE CONSUMING. AND THEN A

00:48:28.705 --> 00:48:30.440
VARIABLE FEE PER UNIT OF ENERGY

00:48:30.507 --> 00:48:32.142
ON TOP OF THAT I USED TO

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:33.744
DESCRIBE CELL PHONE PLANS TO MY

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.145
STUDENTS BUT NOW EVERYBODY GETS

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:37.080
FREE DATA ANYWAY SO IT'S LESS

00:48:37.147 --> 00:48:39.116
INFORMATIVE- BUT IT'S NOT AN

00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:40.751
UNUSUAL SORT OF COST STRUCTURE

00:48:40.817 --> 00:48:41.885
IN A LOT OF KIND OF UTILITY

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:45.155
SETTINGS- NOW. IT IS SOMETHING

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:46.690
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT. AMONG

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:48.825
PRACTICED IN CALIFORNIA A LARGE

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:49.993
REGULATED UTILITIES- RECOVER

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.328
ALL OF THEIR COSTS THROUGH A

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:53.196
VARIABLE FEE THERE IS A MINIMUM

00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:56.133
BILL IT'S VERY MODEST- AND-

00:48:56.199 --> 00:48:58.802
THAT PUTS MORE OF THE COST

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:00.537
BURDEN INTO THE VARIABLE FEE

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.072
AND THAT CONTRIBUTES TO HIGHER.

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:05.275
VARIABLE PRICES- THIS IS JUST A

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:06.710
COUPLE MAPS FROM WORK WITH MY

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.011
COLLEAGUES EVAN BOURNE STING

00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:09.980
WORRIED AND SCRAPING ELECTRIC

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:11.748
RATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR

00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:15.485
QUITE SOME TIME OFF THE WEB.

00:49:15.552 --> 00:49:16.620
THE DARK THE TO HEAR THE HI THE

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:17.287
CHARGES AND ESSENTIALLY THIS IS

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:17.754
THE- FIXED CHARGE THE

00:49:17.821 --> 00:49:20.257
SUBSCRIPTION FEE. PAID BY IF

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:21.358
YOU'RE CONNECTED TO UTILITY

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:23.093
ACROSS THE COUNTRY-

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.695
CALIFORNIA'S AT THE EXTREME

00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:26.163
HERE OF HAVING IT'S ACTUALLY A

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:27.464
LITTLE BIT NEGATIVE BECAUSE YOU

00:49:27.531 --> 00:49:28.598
GET THIS CALIFORNIA CLIMATE

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:30.000
REBATE WHEN YOU'RE CONNECTED TO

00:49:30.067 --> 00:49:31.635
A- REGULATED UTILITY. IN

00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:33.136
ADDITION TO NOT HAVING TO PAY A

00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:36.039
MONTHLY FIXED FEE- SO THERE IS

00:49:36.106 --> 00:49:37.407
THERE AREN'T COSTS BEING

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:38.475
RECOVERED TO THIS FEE AND THAT

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:39.910
CONTRIBUTES TO THIS PICTURE.

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:41.611
WHICH IS THE VARIABLE COMPONENT

00:49:41.678 --> 00:49:44.147
OF THE PRICES- WHERE-

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:46.416
CALIFORNIA IS I SHOULD SAY

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:48.618
AMONG THE HIGHEST- I. WAS JUST

00:49:48.685 --> 00:49:49.853
LOOKING AT THIS RHODE ISLAND

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.688
UNDER SOME METRICS COULD CLAIM

00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:54.391
THAT THE CHAMPIONSHIP BELT HERE

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:56.360
BUT- CALIFORNIA MAY BE PASSING

00:49:56.426 --> 00:49:58.662
THEM SOON. POINT WE HAVE VERY

00:49:58.729 --> 00:49:59.563
HOT VARIABLE ACTRESS. IS FOR

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:01.531
MANY REASONS ONE OF WHICH IS

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:02.032
THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT

00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:02.532
RECOVERING ANY OF THESE

00:50:02.599 --> 00:50:04.000
INTEREST COSTS THROUGH MY-

00:50:04.067 --> 00:50:05.836
FIXED FEE. AND SO WHEN YOU'RE

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:07.270
THINKING ABOUT PLUGGING A CAR

00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:11.808
AND EVEY- INTO YOUR METER- IT'S

00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:13.043
THIS PRICE YOU'RE GONNA PAY PER

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:15.145
KILOWATT HOUR AND THAT'S PART

00:50:15.212 --> 00:50:17.581
OF THE CONCERN WE HAVE- ALL

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:18.882
RIGHT SO WHAT THE REACTIONS

00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:20.817
I'VE GOTTEN ONE OF PRESENTED

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:21.418
THIS WORK. UP VERTICALLY FROM

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:21.985
THE VIRAL COMMUNITIES WELL

00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:23.019
ISN'T IT THEY HAVE HIGH

00:50:23.086 --> 00:50:24.821
ELECTRICITY PRICES IS NOT GOOD

00:50:24.888 --> 00:50:26.189
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE

00:50:26.256 --> 00:50:28.725
WANT TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM

00:50:28.792 --> 00:50:32.362
USING ELECTRICITY. AND I GUESS

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:35.365
WE'VE GOT A BILL TO FAR WITH IT.

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:37.634
THIS IS. EFFICIENCY ENERGY IF.

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:42.172
TO YOU. THE ENTER KEY. WHY

00:50:42.239 --> 00:50:43.240
EFFICIENTLY NOT THAT USE IT AT

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:44.408
ALL AND SO IF WE WANT TO THINK

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:45.909
THE SITE OF OUR HI GO THEN YOU

00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:46.877
HAVE THAT WILL HOW HIGH IS TOO

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:50.247
HIGH THEN- AND ONE METRIC ONE

00:50:50.313 --> 00:50:51.681
THAT THAT ECONOMIST SORT OF

00:50:51.748 --> 00:50:52.983
EMBRACE IS THIS IDEA OF

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:54.918
COMPARING THE COST OF THE

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:56.453
TURNING ON A LOW FALL BELOW.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.588
GOING IN YOU ELECTRIC ARE UP TO

00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:00.657
THE COST ACTUALLY PUT RIDING

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.325
THE ELECTRICITY TO THAT

00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:03.994
CONSUMER WHO IS GOING TO BE

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:07.431
USING IT- AND THIS IS A

00:51:07.497 --> 00:51:09.132
COMBINATION OF THE COST OF

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:10.667
GENERATING ELECTRIC THE MARKET

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:13.170
GENERATE AND CAUGHT AN

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:17.240
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDENT WE HAVE

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:18.141
BEEN THE SAME ISSUE ERICA THERE

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:24.781
SIR. IN ACOSTA INCLUDE. ANY

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:27.417
METRIC. AT THIS. REALLY

00:51:27.484 --> 00:51:29.052
APPEALING ASK IN ITS EXCEPT

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.520
WHERE PRODUCING THE POWER THE

00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:31.354
MORE ACOSTA SACK QUITE. IT'S

00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:33.056
CAPITAL. SO THE OVERALL CAN HI.

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:34.157
BUT THINKING OVER. LANTS YOU A

00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:34.724
LOT FRONT EXPENDED BUT ACT

00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:35.725
PRODUCE THE ELECT. IS

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:38.128
ESSENTIALLY FREE ARM AND

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:39.496
THEREFORE WE DON'T ACTUALLY

00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:41.331
WANT TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM

00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:42.933
USING IT ONCE WE'VE MADE THOSE

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:44.267
INVESTMENTS ABOUT OUR PRICING

00:51:44.334 --> 00:51:45.335
STRUCTURE ISN'T. DOING THAT

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:47.137
IT'S ALSO CLEAN SO WE HAVE

00:51:47.204 --> 00:51:48.238
ACTUALLY CHEAP TO PRODUCE CLEAN

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:50.273
ELECTRICITY BUT OUR PRICES

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.475
DON'T REALLY REFLECT THOSE

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:56.780
FACTS- OKAY SO THIS US ALARMING

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:57.280
MAP IT'S NOT A- IT'S NOT

00:51:57.347 --> 00:52:02.819
POLITICAL. IT'S A- IT'S A MESS.

00:52:02.886 --> 00:52:05.021
THE RELATIVE COST OF PROVIDING

00:52:05.088 --> 00:52:07.691
THAT ELECTRICITY TO A CUSTOMER

00:52:07.757 --> 00:52:08.859
AND SO THE DARKER THE BLUE HERE

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:10.994
BASICALLY THAT'S THE DEGREE TO

00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:12.696
WHICH PRICES ARE TOO HIGH BY

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:14.464
OUR METRIC. THE DEGREE TO WHICH

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:15.665
THE VERY LOW PRICE EXCEEDS THE

00:52:15.732 --> 00:52:17.834
COST TO BE A PROVIDING THAT

00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:19.536
CUSTOMER WITH THE ELECTRICITY

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:22.038
AGAIN INCLUDING CARBON COST

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:23.974
LOCAL AIR POLLUTANT AND A FEW

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.009
OTHER- FEDERATION. NOW THERE

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:28.612
ARE PARTS OF THE- HE IS TO KEEP.

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:30.347
THE INS WITH THE LAW OF COAL

00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:31.281
CREATING A LOT OF SOUL FOR THE

00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:32.382
CAUSES DAMAGE FOR OTHER

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:34.417
COMMUNITIES CALIFORNIA IS NOT

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:35.452
ONE OF THOSE STATES- CALIFORNIA

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:36.720
IS A STATE WHERE PRICES ARE

00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:39.756
EXTREMELY HIGH RELATIVE TO THE

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:40.957
COST OF PROVIDING INCREMENTAL

00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:44.828
POWER TO THOSE STATES- NOW.

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:47.797
I'LL SO. ELECTRICITY WE STARTED

00:52:47.864 --> 00:52:50.901
THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE GOAL

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:51.501
THAT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO SWITCH

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:53.603
PEOPLE FROM ALL. THOSE OTHER

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:55.572
SOURCES OF FUEL TO ELECTRICITY.

00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:57.207
AND SO AGAIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:59.209
HAVING MORE IN THIS IS WORK IN

00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:00.977
PROGRESS WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:02.312
DO THE SAME EXERCISE FOR THE OF

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:06.182
FUELS. SO WE PROJECT ONE YOU

00:53:06.249 --> 00:53:06.716
PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD THE

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:08.919
ANSWER ARGUABLY YES- THAT

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:10.320
GASOLINE WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THE

00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:12.322
ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS OF A

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:13.590
BURNING GASOLINE PARTICULARLY

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:15.458
IN SOME URBAN AREAS IS ARGUABLY

00:53:15.525 --> 00:53:17.627
A LITTLE TOO CHEAP BOB

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:18.695
CERTAINLY RELATIVE TO

00:53:18.762 --> 00:53:20.764
ELECTRICITY WHICH IS MASSIVELY

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.799
OVER PRICE- WE ARE AGAIN WORK

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:26.503
IN PROSPERED BY TRYING TO

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:29.272
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO FROM THE

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:31.441
UNDER PRICE TOOL TO THE PRICE

00:53:31.508 --> 00:53:33.176
FUEL. THAT PASSES BETWEEN THE

00:53:33.243 --> 00:53:37.080
STRUCTURE THAT THERE IS WELL

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:37.914
AND SO ARE MET AT LEAST A

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:40.717
LITTLE. BUT NOT NOT NEARLY AS

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:42.719
MUCH AS THE ELECTRIC SECTOR.

00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:44.154
ALL RIGHT SO STEPS THAT COULD

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.723
HELP- GORY HEARD ACTUALLY MOST

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:50.694
OF THESE- POINT TO BE MADE- SO

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:51.561
ONE WOULD BE TO STOP ADDING.

00:53:51.628 --> 00:53:54.030
CALL BUT THAT DID A TO BE DELAY

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:55.398
TO THE ELECTRIC SECTOR BUT ARE

00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:57.067
NOT DIRECTLY ELATED TO THE

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:59.002
PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY. AND

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:00.403
ADDING THEM TO ELECTRIC BILLS

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:02.739
AND I THINK- OF WILDFIRE

00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:04.908
RELATED COSTS ARE GOING TO BE

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:07.844
CERTAINLY THE BIG- THE TICKET

00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:10.213
ITEM THAT WILL BE WILL BE

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.681
DEBATED GOING FORWARD HERE- BUT

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:12.983
THE OTHERS WE HEARD ABOUT

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:15.185
ENERGY EFFICIENT. GRAMS OUR

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:16.720
PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT LOW

00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:18.555
INCOME ENERGY CONSUMERS WHICH

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:20.423
ARE CERTAINLY WORTH WHILE DOING

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.692
BUT IT'S ALL WORTH ASKING

00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:23.460
WHETHER THE SHOULD BE FUNDED

00:54:23.526 --> 00:54:25.695
FROM ELECTRIC RATES THEMSELVES.

00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:27.597
ARE OTHER WAYS TO TRY TO

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:30.634
PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THOSE TYPES

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:34.304
OF PROGRAMS. THEN THIS POINT IS

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:35.305
TO THE EXTENT WE CAN'T SHIFT

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:37.073
SOME OF THESE PUBLIC POLICY

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.908
COSTS ON TO OTHER REVENUE

00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:41.144
SOURCES- TRY TO REDESIGN THE

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:43.179
TERRORISTS THEMSELVES IN WAYS

00:54:43.246 --> 00:54:45.015
THAT BETTER ALIGN WITH THE COST

00:54:45.081 --> 00:54:46.883
SENATE COURAGE PEOPLE TO USE

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:47.717
THE ELECTRICITY NGUYEN AND

00:54:47.784 --> 00:54:50.053
WHERE. IT BRED IN BACK SHOW FOR

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:53.223
THEM TO DO SO AND THAT WOULD AS

00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:54.457
ROSS SAID PROBABLY INVOLVED

00:54:54.524 --> 00:54:56.626
RECOVERING AT THE A LITTLE MORE

00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:59.095
THAN ZERO SUM COSTS FROM A-

00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:04.334
MONTHLY FIXED CHARGE IF WE WERE.

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:06.169
BASICALLY A CARE VERSION OF A

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:08.405
MONTHLY FIXED CHARGE- TO TRY TO

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:10.206
ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS.

00:55:10.273 --> 00:55:12.642
AND THEN LASTLY- AND- I THINK

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:14.244
ASSEMBLYMAN QUIRK STOLE SOME OF

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:17.347
MY THUNDER HERE- WEEK. THERE'S

00:55:17.414 --> 00:55:18.915
AN ARGUMENT TO SUPPORT CLIMATE

00:55:18.982 --> 00:55:20.850
POLICIES THAT THAT ARE

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:22.719
TARGETING REDUCING CARBON

00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:24.387
EMISSIONS THAT MY TIME- BUT NOT

00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:27.457
NOT NEARLY OVERLY STRICT IN THE

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:28.625
CHURCH A SET. OF UP UTILITIES

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:29.826
OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS IN

00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:32.228
TERMS OF DOING IT I THINK THE

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:33.430
THAT SOUL THE ROOF TAKE MEANT

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:37.000
ROOFTOP MAN IS IT IS AN EXIT.

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:38.201
WERE PUSHING LETTER G. TO

00:55:38.268 --> 00:55:40.270
HONEST. BACK OUT IT SHOULD BE

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:41.271
THE ONE ALLOW FLICK. FOR

00:55:41.337 --> 00:55:43.907
FINDING THE LOWEST COST WAYS OF

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:45.041
ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS RIGHT

00:55:45.108 --> 00:55:53.917
THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:55:53.983 --> 00:55:59.255
THE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN

00:55:59.322 --> 00:56:00.023
HOLDEN AND MEMBERS OF THE

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.591
COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LINDA

00:56:01.658 --> 00:56:03.093
STARS OUT AND I'M THE DIRECTOR

00:56:03.159 --> 00:56:04.994
IN THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:06.096
BUT I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU VERY

00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:08.832
MUCH FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:10.333
TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING-

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.802
WE THINK IT'S VERY. IMPORTANT

00:56:12.869 --> 00:56:16.539
TO AND GOOD TIMING A TO HAVE OF

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:18.842
THE DISCUSSION OF WHERE WE

00:56:18.908 --> 00:56:20.710
FOCUS ON THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.345
SEEING IN LIKE ELECTRIC ALL

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:26.583
ELECTRIC BILLS. I WANT

00:56:26.649 --> 00:56:27.550
EMPHASIZE THAT I PRESSED TO

00:56:27.617 --> 00:56:28.985
TODAY FOLK. EXCLUSIVE ON

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:30.487
RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS RATES

00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:34.824
BILLS- I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE

00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:38.495
SOME. OF SOME KEY THEMES THAT

00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:40.163
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR IN THE

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.665
PRESENTATION. SO STARTING WITH

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:45.535
TWO. FIRST OF ALL SOME OF YOU

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:46.870
PROBABLY HEARD THE STATEMENT

00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:48.238
THAT CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY

00:56:48.304 --> 00:56:51.441
ELECTRICITY RATES ARE TRACKING

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:54.177
OR ON PARK OR ON PAR WITH THE

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:57.113
RATE OF INFLATION. AND THAT WAS

00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:00.083
TRUE UP UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AGO

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:02.585
AND THE THAT IS NOW THE RATES

00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:06.189
ARE FAR OUTPACING THE RATE OF

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:06.756
INFLATION AND WE'LL SHOW YOU

00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:09.392
DATE ON THAT. THING IS WHEN YOU

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:11.127
HEAR THAT STATEMENT IT'S VERY

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:13.897
IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT RATES

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:15.465
ARE BEING REFERENCED WHEN THEY

00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:17.300
SAY RATES ARE TRACKING WITH THE

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:18.802
RATE OF INFLATION. OTHERS

00:57:18.868 --> 00:57:21.404
DIFFERENT DEFINING RATES SO

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:21.938
USUALLY WHEN YOU HEAR THAT

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:24.207
STATEMENT. THE STATEMENT IS

00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:25.441
REFERRING TO SYSTEM AVERAGE

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:27.544
RATES AND SYSTEM AVERAGE RATES

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:29.412
ARE CUT THE COMBINED RATES ALL

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:31.848
THE CUSTOMER CLASSES FROM THE

00:57:31.915 --> 00:57:33.650
LARGEST WHICH WHICH WOULD BE

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:35.785
THINK IT DOES COST. TO THE

00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:39.489
SMALLEST VERSUS CUSTOMERS

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:42.025
REALLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:57:42.091 --> 00:57:44.828
DRILL DOWN DEEPER INTO CUSTOMER

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:46.863
CLASS SPECIFIC GRADES AND EVEN

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:49.065
BEYOND THAT YOU CAN GO FURTHER

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:52.869
BEYOND THAT IF YOU IF YOU TIME

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:56.406
AT THE END OF MY PRESENTATION I

00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:58.341
CAN FOCUS ON. WHAT DRIVING LOW

00:57:58.408 --> 00:57:59.442
LOW YOU CUSTOMER RATES AS WELL

00:57:59.509 --> 00:58:00.543
WHICH A SUBSET OF RESIDENTIAL

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:05.281
CUSTOMERS. SO THE MORE

00:58:05.348 --> 00:58:07.150
AGGREGATE THE RATE THE SYSTEM

00:58:07.217 --> 00:58:08.952
AVERAGE RATE THE MORE THE

00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:11.821
MASKING OF THE IMPACT ON

00:58:11.888 --> 00:58:13.456
RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS OF

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:16.392
INCREASED RATES. MOVING ON TO

00:58:16.459 --> 00:58:20.496
SLIDE THREE. I WANT TO MENTION

00:58:20.563 --> 00:58:22.599
THE PRIMARY DRIVERS TO THE RATE

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.500
INCREASES THAT WE'RE SEEING

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:26.269
FIRST THERE'S BEEN A STEADY

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:28.504
INCREASE IN REVENUE REQUIREMENT

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:30.039
UTILITIES ARE AUTHORIZED TO

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:31.908
CHARGE FOR CUSTOMERS REVENUE

00:58:31.975 --> 00:58:33.142
REQUIREMENT IS JUST ANOTHER WAY

00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:35.478
OF SAYING THE MONEY AT THE

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:37.614
UTILITIES. ARE AUTHORIZED TO

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.650
RECOVER FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS.

00:58:40.717 --> 00:58:43.620
PUT ANOTHER WAY IT'S THE COST

00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:44.220
THAT RATE PAYERS PAY FOR THEIR

00:58:44.287 --> 00:58:47.223
SERVICE. SO WE'VE SEEN A STEADY

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:49.792
INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR OF

00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:52.495
UTILITIES REVENUE REQUESTS. AND

00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:55.832
WE HAVE SEEN ALSO OF THE A

00:58:55.899 --> 00:58:57.433
DECLINE THIS IS THE SECOND

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.202
DRIVER A DECLINE SIGNIFICANT

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:02.972
DECLINE IN SALES VOLUMES. A AND

00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:04.607
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS

00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:05.208
BASICALLY THE ELECTRICITY SOLD

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:08.077
TO CUSTOMERS. UGH THE REASONS

00:59:08.144 --> 00:59:10.613
FOR THAT ARE ARE GREAT

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.849
SUCCESSES IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

00:59:12.916 --> 00:59:15.351
AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT GROWTH

00:59:15.418 --> 00:59:20.290
IN ROOFTOP SOLAR. SO MOVING ON

00:59:20.356 --> 00:59:25.895
TO SLIDE. FOR HERE ARE GOING TO

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:27.931
LOOK AT SOME DATA OF I'M GONNA

00:59:27.997 --> 00:59:30.266
PULL BACK AND LOOK AT SYSTEM

00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:31.901
AVERAGE RATES AGAIN THESE ARE

00:59:31.968 --> 00:59:34.003
COMBINED RATES OF WERE CAUGHT

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:50.253
THE LARGEST

00:59:52.188 --> 00:59:52.622
BASICALLY TRACKING WITH THE

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:55.124
RATE OF INFLATION. OF ITS OWN

00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:56.859
THIS TIME PARTICULARLY FOR P.

00:59:56.926 --> 00:59:58.494
GINNY INDUSTRY GENIE THAT YOU

00:59:58.561 --> 01:00:02.065
SEE SIGNIFICANT SALES DECLINES

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:02.632
PARTICULARLY FOR RESIDENTIAL

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.567
CUSTOMERS. ARE FROM RESIDENTIAL

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:07.503
CUSTOMERS. YOU ALSO SEE THAT

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:09.372
EDISON SYSTEM AVERAGE RATE

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:13.109
TRACKS PRETTY MUCH ON PAR WITH

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:16.179
THE RATE OF INFLATION FOR NOW.

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:20.483
BEING TO SLIDE FIVE. HERE WE'RE

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:21.584
LOOKING AT THE RESIDENTIAL

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:24.220
SALES VOLUMES SIGNIFICANTLY

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:28.091
DECLINE AGAIN STARTING AROUND

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:28.691
TWENTY FOURTEEN FOR P. JEANNIE

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:30.960
AND SGD. AND YOU WILL SEE

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:34.330
DECLINE FOR EDISON SALES AROUND

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:34.931
TWENTY FIFTEEN AS YOU MAY BE

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:36.199
WONDERING BUT WHAT YOU JUST

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.433
SAID THAT'S THE SYSTEM AVERAGE

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.168
RATE FOR EDISON WAS TRACKING

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:41.804
WITH THE RATE INFLATION SO.

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:43.840
THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE THINK

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:46.009
THAT SO IS EVEN DESPITE THE

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:48.611
SALES DECLINE AS- AROUND THAT

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:50.980
TIME WE SAW EDISON TAKING SOME

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:52.048
SIGNIFICANT COST CUTTING

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:53.583
MEASURES. A WE SAW THAT

01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:55.718
PRIMARILY IN THEIR GENERAL CASE

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:57.053
APPLICATIONS. THERE ARE SOME

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.354
OTHER THINGS TO THAT END OF

01:00:58.421 --> 01:00:59.922
SUCH AS A REFUND SO THEY WERE

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:01.824
REQUIRED TO GIVE TO CUSTOMERS

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:10.967
TO THE SONGS. MOVING TO SLIDE.

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:11.868
SIX NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET EVEN

01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:13.870
MORE SPECIFIC WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:16.005
OF THE RESIDENTIAL THE AVERAGE

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:20.209
RESIDENTIAL RATES. SO HERE

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:22.512
YOU'LL SEE US USING THESE

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:24.147
REPRESENTED BY THE REDLINE.

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:26.682
THEIR RATES OF INCREASE 57%

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:28.851
SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE UP

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:31.154
THROUGH JANUARY ONE TWENTY

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.322
TWENTY. ONE REPRESENTS P.

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:36.626
GENIES RATES AND THE GREEN LINE

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:38.761
EDISON'S. AND AGAIN THE

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:40.329
DAUGHTER GRAY LINE IS THE RATE

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:44.367
OF INFLATION. SO JUST TO BE

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:45.968
CLEAR ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.504
BETWEEN REVENUES WHICH IS THE

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:50.473
MONEY THAT THE UTILITIES ARE

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.974
AUTHORIZED TO RECOVER FROM THE

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:55.511
CUSTOMERS. AND SALES WHICH IS

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:58.214
WHAT THE UTILITY BECAUSE IT'S

01:01:58.281 --> 01:01:59.949
PAID FOR SERVICE. YOU TAKE THE

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:01.684
REVENUES YOU DIVIDE BY THE

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:03.386
SALES AND YOU GET THE AVERAGE

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:08.391
WAS INITIAL RIGHT. SO MOVING ON

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:12.795
TO SLIDE SEVEN. YOU MAY BE

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:15.264
WONDERING WHERE IT'S GOING. END

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:18.634
THIS GRAPH SPECIFICALLY FOCUSES

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:25.842
HAVE TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS SO

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:27.243
WHEN WE DID THIS FORECAST OF

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.878
VEGGIES RATES WE ASSUME THAT

01:02:40.456 --> 01:02:42.358
THE GRAY LINE REPRESENTS THE

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:48.464
HISTORIC RATE. STARTING FROM.

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:48.998
TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:49.732
NINETEEN. THE YELLOW PART

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:52.735
REPRESENTS THE FORECAST. AND

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.470
THE OTHER PART IS A COMBINATION

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:57.940
OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:02:58.007 --> 01:02:58.508
APPROVED AND ARE GOING TO GO

THOSE THINGS ARE AGAIN PENDING.

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:10.119
YOU CAN SEE THAT THEIR RATE IS

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:12.522
FORECAST TO FAR OUTPACE THE

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:15.424
RATE OF INFLATION. I FOR

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:16.726
COMPARISON SAKE THE GREAT

01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:20.396
DOTTED LINE HERE- WE TOOK THE

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:24.100
RATE OF INFLATION AND JUST

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.301
ESCALATED SEEKING SEE FOR SAKE

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:27.069
THE RATE WOULD BE IF IT WAS

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:31.207
JUST ESCALATED FOR INFLATION.

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:33.509
MOVING TO SLIDE EIGHT THIS IS A

01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:35.111
FORECAST OF P. GENIES

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:38.848
RESIDENTIAL RATES. AGAIN THE

HISTORIC RATE AND THE YELLOW

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:46.422
LINE IS A FORECAST. THE YELLOW

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.424
LINE ASSUMES THAT P. GENIES

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:49.926
MOST RECENT GENERATE CASE

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:51.861

THE NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS OUR

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:01.270
FOCUS OF EDISON'S AVERAGE

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:04.373
RESIDENTIAL RATE. YOU RECALL

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.275
THAT EDISON'S RATE WAS TRACKING

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:08.911
WITH INFLATION BOTH SYSTEM

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:10.846
AVERAGE AND RESIDENTIAL. OUR

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:12.882
FORECAST HOWEVER SHOWS THAT

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:14.417
NOPE THERE COULD BE A VERY

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:16.052
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE BY THE END

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:18.254
OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT'S

01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:19.922
BECAUSE WE FACTORED IN THEIR

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:21.724
MOST RECENT GENERATE CASE

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:36.305
THAT A- THAT RECALL. IS. SO

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:39.508
CLEARLY OF EDISON'S RATE IS NOT

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:42.812
WE DON'T FORECASTED CONTINUING

01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:43.512
TO TRACK WITH THE RATE OF

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:44.914
INFLATION GET THE RATE OF

WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS WE

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:21.597
DEVELOPED A TWO. OUR COMPUTER

01:08:21.664 --> 01:08:24.099
MODEL. THAT WILL HELP DECISION

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:26.602
MAKERS SEE THE IMPACT OF

IT NOW. I AND BLAH IN A BUT I

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:02.718
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BRING

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.219
IT DOWN TO KIND OF A REAL

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:07.256
UTILITY LEVEL- AND I WOULD SAY

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:09.091
THERE'S REALLY FOR- PRIMARY

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:10.726
DRIVERS OF WHY WE'RE SEEING.

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:12.194
HIGHER RATES AND ULTIMATELY

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:13.529
HIGHER BILLS YOU'VE HEARD IT.

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:16.198
SALES ARE DECLINING YOU KNOW SO

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:17.499
FOR US ARE OVERALL SALES NOT

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:19.034
JUST RESIDENTIAL ARE DOWN ABOUT

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:22.171
14% SINCE SINCE TWENTY TWELVE.

01:12:22.237 --> 01:12:22.671
AND THAT AGAIN THAT IS

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:25.140
VIRTUALLY. TO THE SUCCESS STATE

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:28.243
WE'RE SEEING LESS GOODUSAGE

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.944
BECAUSE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.112
AND A MASSIVE MASSIVE

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:31.714
INCREASING AMOUNT OF SOLAR

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.682
POWER- SPECIALLY IN THE SAN

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:35.617
DIEGO REGION. HOPE IS THAT AS

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.920
WE BEGIN TO SEE MORE ELECTRIC

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:40.889
VEHICLES COME ONLINE- WE DO WE

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:42.825
WILL SEE YOU KNOW SEE MORE

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.893
LECTURE VACATION DOWN THE LINE

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.595
THAT WE CAN GET. A START TO

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:49.631
STABILIZE THE SALESMAN THAT

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:51.233
WOULD COULD HAVE A POSITIVE

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.969
IMPACT ON ITS- CERTAINLY GOOD

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:56.638
EFFORT THE- SMITH. AND YOU KNOW

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:58.006
THIS IS THE PIE. YOUR DOCTOR

01:12:58.073 --> 01:12:59.775
WILL. IN THIS CASE BUT THE

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:02.177
WIRES WE USE TO DELAY ELECT.

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:04.413
FOR CUSTOMERS YOU KNOW WHAT HE-

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:12.321
KEEPS SO LOT. OF YEARS UPPER BG.

01:13:12.387 --> 01:13:14.790
VESTED ONE POINT FIVE. DOLLARS

01:13:14.857 --> 01:13:16.291
AS IN YOU FIRE SAFE PROGRAM IN

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:16.959
ORDER PROTECT OUR CUSTOMER FROM

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:18.393
CALLOUS. ALL THOSE ARE

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.361
INVESTMENT THAT RISK I THINK

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:20.896
THE- THERE WERE. IN TO WE CAN

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:21.830
NEXT TO SEE INVEST IN A FEW TO

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:25.701
KEEPER COMMUNITIES. WHAT NUMBER

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:27.903
THREE REALLY POLICY MANDATES SO

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.905
THIS IS A FAIRLY LARGE BUCKET

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:31.273
THAT INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.107
THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO

01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:34.843
STANDARD- LOW INCOME PROGRAMS

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:38.247
ENERGY EFFICIENCY S. CHIP- YOU

01:13:38.313 --> 01:13:40.115
KNOW ALL YOUR MOST OF THEM AT

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:41.617
LEAST I WE THINK ARE REALLY

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:42.751
REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS.

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:43.986
ASPECTS YEAR LOW INCOME

01:13:44.052 --> 01:13:47.489
PROGRAMS- IN TAKING AND TAKEN

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:50.058
AS KIND OF A SINGULAR PROGRAM

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:51.593
IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE BUT WHEN

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:52.961
YOU START TO ADD ALL THESE

01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:54.429
TOGETHER. WE ACTUALLY ESTIMATE

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:56.465
THAT ABOUT 22% OF OUR ELECTRIC

01:13:56.532 --> 01:13:59.268
RATE IS MANDATES AND SO IT IS

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:02.571
BECOMING A- A BIGGER CHUNK OF.

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:04.373
OF OUR OVERALL RATE OUTLOOK.

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:06.942
FINALLY IN THE MORE BILLS SO WE

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:09.144
AGAIN WE TALK A LOT ABOUT RATES

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:11.113
IN THE END A CUSTOMER SEES A

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.848
BILL. LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF HOW

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:15.317
WHAT IS THE TOTAL THAT I OWED

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:17.753
ES DE GENIE IN A GIVEN MONTH. I

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:21.290
TALKED WHAT'S OF MURDERS.

01:14:21.356 --> 01:14:23.392
BETTER ISSUE THE NOT PAY. PAY

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:25.160
BILLS. WE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:25.861
THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE IS

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:26.795
THE EFFECTS OF CHANGE WE'VE

01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:29.031
TALKED ABOUT IT A LOT YOU KNOW

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:30.265
HERE IN THE STATE AND CERTAINLY

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:32.034
IN THE LEGISLATURE WHAT WE'RE

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.203
SEEING IS HOTTER LONGER AND

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:36.104
MORE INTENSE SUMMERS IN SAN

01:14:36.171 --> 01:14:38.240
DIEGO THIS INCLUDES OUR COASTAL

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:41.343
REGIONS. AND IN TWO THOUSAND

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:42.611
EIGHTEEN WE EXPERIENCE THE SIX

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:44.012
HOTTEST WEEKS WE'VE EVER

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:45.547
EXPERIENCED IN SAN DIEGO AND

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:48.417
THAT'S HOUSING MORE ELECTRICITY

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:49.952
DEMAND. REGION AND AGAIN IT'S

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:53.255
NOT JUST- IN ONE CUSTOMERS THAT

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:54.456
IS ALSO STARTING TO AFFECT OUR

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:56.191
OUR MORE TEMPERATE CLIMATE-

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:57.926
COASTAL CUSTOMERS AS WELL AND

01:14:57.993 --> 01:15:00.996
SO THIS IS BECOMING- A TRUE

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.631
IMPACT CLIMATE IS BECOMING A

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:04.867
TRUE IMPACT ON ACTUAL ENERGY

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:09.071
BILLS. SO THAT THOSE ARE KIND

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:10.172
OF THE DRIVERS TO LET ME TALK

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:11.807
ABOUT JUST LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:13.375
SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS ONCE A

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:15.878
VERY SPECIFIC POLICY AND THEN-

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:18.247
MAYBE THREE TRENDS THAT FOR AT

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:20.182
THAT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. I YOU

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:22.251
KNOW WHAT WE THAT PROBABLY ONE

01:15:22.317 --> 01:15:22.885
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:23.852
TERM ACTIONS THAT WE COULD

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:26.588
TAKE. IT PERFORMING THAT ENERGY

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:27.589
METERING POLICY THAT SO THIS IS

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:30.626
THE SUBSIDY- THAT WE PAY TO. TO

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:32.961
SOLAR OWNERS NOW. LET ME BE

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.396
CLEAR FROM THE GET GO IS THAT

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:35.864
ESTROGEN STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:38.934
OUR CUSTOMERS. ADDING SOLAR BUT

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:41.336
TO THEIR HOMES- MATTER FACT

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:42.371
WE'VE GOT ABOUT 13% OF OUR

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:43.772
CUSTOMERS TODAY THAT ABOUT

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:45.841
SOLAR AND THAT SO THAT IS A

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:47.376
MASSIVE INCREASE. IN THE AMOUNT

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:50.445
OF SOLAR IN SAN DIEGO. BUT WHAT

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:52.047
IT IS DOING IS THAT IS SHIFTING

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:53.882
BECAUSE THOSE FOR CUSTOMERS FOR

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:55.884
AVOIDING COSTS. YOUR VOIDING

01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:57.619
HAVING TO PAY FOR THE GRID

01:15:57.686 --> 01:16:00.389
WE'RE SEEING NOW AN ESTIMATED

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:01.356
FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:04.092
DOLLARS A YEAR. OF COSTS THAT

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:05.260
ARE BEING SHIFTED FROM OUR

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:07.129
SOLAR CUSTOMERS. FOR NON SORT

01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:10.232
CUSTOMERS. OKAY SO WE DO WANT

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:11.900
TO BALANCE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:13.969
THAT WE HAVE FAIR AND EQUITABLE

01:16:14.036 --> 01:16:15.404
ENERGY POLICY THAT BALANCES THE

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:17.639
NEED TO WE WANT MORE SOLAR. WE

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:19.074
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HELPS

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:21.209
DRIVE DOWN CHICHI THAT HELPS US

01:16:21.276 --> 01:16:22.477
WITH OUR CLIMATE GOALS BUT

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:24.112
THERE IS AN EQUITY ISSUE

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:26.048
BECAUSE WHAT IS OCCURRING AS I

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:28.350
THINK ABOUT OUR- YOU KNOW OUR

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.153
FAMILIES IN EL CAJON INLAND

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:32.354
VERY HOT AREA YOU KNOW IF. WE

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.156
HAVE FOUR MAYBE MAKE SIX

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:34.957
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:36.858
AFFORD SOLAR DOESN'T HAVE THE

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:37.893
MEANS TO PUT SOLAR ON THEIR

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.195
HOMES THEY'RE NOW PAYING A

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:42.531
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT- PENALTY. ON

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:45.000
THEIR ENERGY. FOR POOR FLUENT.

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:47.035
TO BE ABLE TO PUT SALT ON THEIR

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:49.304
HOMES. OKAY SO AGAIN AS POLICY

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:50.372
MAKERS WERE GONNA NEED TO

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.074
BALANCE. THE YOU KNOW THIS

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.609
ISSUE OF EQUITY. WITH THE WITH

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:56.445
ENVIRONMENTAL A PROGRESS

01:16:56.511 --> 01:16:58.280
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT IS

01:16:58.347 --> 01:17:02.484
COMPLETELY AN EQUITABLE. IN IN

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:04.086
TERMS OF THAT ENERGY METER

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:05.153
POLICY NEAR THE PUBLIC

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.788
UTILITIES COMMISSION DID MAKES

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:11.026
VERY VERY MINOR TWEAKS AND IN

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:11.560
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUT-

01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:12.828
EXPECTING TO HAVE A MORE

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:15.630
FUNDAMENTAL REFORM OF NET

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:16.932
ENERGY METERING IS SUPPOSED TO

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:17.666
BE KICKED OFF IN TWENTY

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.267
NINETEEN. THAT SITTING HAS NOT

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:21.837
STARTED YET OUR AND CERTAINLY

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:24.006
NUMBER FORM WAS A COMPONENT OF

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:25.741
AB THREE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH WAS

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:28.410
THE LAST. COULD BE ENERGY-

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.078
ENERGY RATE RESTRUCTURING BILL

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:33.448
BACK AND TWENTY THIRTEEN SO

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:34.383
THAT'S KIND OF A VERY. SPECIFIC

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:36.385
POLICY THAT WE THINK ADDRESS

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:38.854
IMMEDIATELY LONGER TERM WE

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:39.454
REALLY NEED TO START HAVING A

01:17:39.521 --> 01:17:40.422
CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:41.456
RESTRUCTURING HAVE A

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:43.091
FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:44.092
RATES AND HOW WE PRICE

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:47.629
ELECTRICITY IN THE STATE- YOU

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:49.498
KNOW I WOULD YOU KNOW WE STILL

01:17:49.564 --> 01:17:51.700
COULD HAVE TO THOUGHT SINCE TWO

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:54.102
THOUSAND TEN. MY OF HOW DEVELOP

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:56.805
RATES FOR THERE ARE SOME PENS

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:58.306
THAT WE KEEP IN MY MIND AS WE

01:17:58.373 --> 01:18:00.475
THINK ABOUT RATE NINE RATE

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:04.946
STRUCTURES AND ULTIMATELY THAT

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:08.583
AFFECTS. CUSTER PERSONAL. ABOUT

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:10.419
IT TODAY ELECTRIFICATION SO

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:11.853
TODAY CHARGING VOLUME POLICE OF

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:12.888
ME WITHOUT YOU KNOW EACH

01:18:12.954 --> 01:18:13.889
CUSTOMER PAYS FOR KILL HOUR OF

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:16.691
THAT THEY USE SOME HOURS OF THE

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:18.660
DAY OUR CUSTOMERS COULD PAY

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:20.062
FIFTY OR SIXTY CENTS A KILOWATT

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:22.898
HOUR OKAY AND IF AT THE SAME

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:23.932
TIME WE'RE TRYING TO. IT IT'LL

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:25.033
CLASS FAMILIES BECAUSE FAMILY

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.135
THROUGHOUT CANDY A GO TO SWITCH

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:28.270
TO HAVE TO KEEP THESE IN THE

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:30.238
GARAGE HAVES THE ELECTRIC SPACE

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:31.973
HEATING AT THE LEDUC WATER

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.942
HEATING ELECTRIC COOKING. AT

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:35.911
THOSE PRICES IT'S ON AFFORDABLE

01:18:35.977 --> 01:18:37.312
AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO START

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.181
HAVING A REAL FUNDAMENTAL-

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:40.849
DISCUSSION ABOUT COMPLETELY

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:41.917
RESTRUCTURING HOW WE PRICE

01:18:41.983 --> 01:18:44.920
ELECTRICITY. NUMBER TWO. IS NOT

01:18:44.986 --> 01:18:46.421
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:48.356
NOW LET ME BE CLEAR WE ARE

01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:49.758
STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF OUR

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:52.694
CUSTOMERS- GOING COMMUNITIES

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:54.029
SEGREGATION WE GOT GREAT

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:56.164
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CCA'S.

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:58.533
NDA AND BURKE THERE TO HELP

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.102
MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL. AS YOU

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:01.803
THINK ABOUT BILLS THOUGH THE

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:05.474
ENERGY BILLS CUSTOMER SEES- AS

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.508
MORE OF OUR CUSTOMERS MOVE OVER

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:07.943
TO CCA'S WE THINK THE VAST

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:10.512
MAJORITY WILL BE CCA'S IN

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.447
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:14.015
TWENTY TWO. AT THAT POINT SB

01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:17.252
JEANNIE ONLY CONTROLS ABOUT

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:19.321
5260% OF THE ENERGY BILL. SO

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:21.356
THE REST OF THE DECISIONS ON

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.158
WHAT GOES INTO THAT BILL WILL

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:24.593
BE MADE BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:19:24.659 --> 01:19:26.795
NOT S. D. GMD AND SO AS WE

01:19:26.862 --> 01:19:28.563
THINK ABOUT PRICING AND WE

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.532
THINK ABOUT HOW WE STRUCTURE

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:32.167
RATES THA'S A REALLY

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:33.802
FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANT. THING

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:36.471
THAT WE'VE GOT IT WE'VE TO KEEP

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:38.173
IN MIND THAT WE WILL CONTROL

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.375
ALL BILL. AND THEN FINALLY IS

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:41.810
REALLY AROUND TECHNOLOGY SO WE

01:19:41.877 --> 01:19:43.378
TALKED A LOT ABOUT SOLAR WE'RE

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.113
STARTING TO SEE THE SAME-

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:46.681
GROWTH CURVE IN TERMS OF

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:48.783
STORAGE. SO AGAIN SO NOW WE'VE

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:50.685
GOT YOU KNOW SUBSIDIES FOR

01:19:50.752 --> 01:19:53.421
SOLAR. YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY YOU

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:55.157
KNOW SUBSIDIES FOR STORAGE MORE

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:57.726
OF OUR FLUENT CUSTOMERS GOING

01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:59.060
TO BE A BEEN SOLVED BOTH OF

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:01.062
THOSE. ALLERGY ORDERED REDUCE.

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:03.131
MOUNT ENERGY THAT THEY FROM THE

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:06.535
GREAT AND WHAT'S- PAYING LESS

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:08.336
FOR THE GRID RESOURCE. ACTUALLY

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:09.838
THERE ON STAND BY THEM. AT THAT

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:11.673
POINT MORE YOU KNOW OUR LOOK

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.475
LESS OF WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:14.442
THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO CANNOT

01:20:14.509 --> 01:20:18.013
INSTALL SOLAR AND STORAGE THEY

01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:19.114
ARE GOING TO BE PAYING HIGHER

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:21.249
AND HIGHER RATES SO AGAIN AS

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:22.551
POLICY MAKERS IT'S- REALLY

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:24.252
IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:26.154
CONSIDERED BOTH THE IN

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:28.190
ENVIRONMENTAL- CONSIDERATIONS

01:20:28.256 --> 01:20:29.224
AS WELL AS THE- EQUITY

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:31.793
CONSIDERATION SELF TAUGHT WITH

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:34.095
THAT. THERE TO LOOK AT YOUR

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:37.265
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SHOULD ALL

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:38.500
OF YOU A SURE AND ON THE VERY

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:42.003
IMPORTANT. AND OF ALL TURN MY

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.704
COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS THAT

01:20:42.771 --> 01:20:47.008
THEY MAY HAVE IT IT HAS AS YOU

01:20:47.075 --> 01:20:47.609
WERE PRESENTING I HAVE THAT

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:48.910
THAT SENSE OF YOU KNOW FOR

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:51.746
EVERY. NO ONE STEP FORWARD

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:53.415
THERE WE TAKE WE'RE TAKING TWO

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:55.350
STEPS BACK AND SO IT'S- SORT OF

01:20:55.417 --> 01:20:57.018
THIS HOW DO WE GET TO THE PLACE

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:59.087
WHERE WE ARE ADDRESSING THE

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:00.155
ISSUES OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:02.157
DURING THE RESPONSE SAYING. AS

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:03.792
WE SEE CALIFORNIA MOVING OUT

01:21:03.858 --> 01:21:05.927
VERY AGGRESSIVELY AND SETTING

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:08.296
GOALS AND IT'S OUR PS AND- ARE

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:09.164
WORKING HARD TO GET THERE

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:10.599
CERTAINLY BY TWENTY THIRTY

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:12.367
SALUTE TALENTS IN AFTER THAT

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:15.003
BUT YOUR MAP THE DESCRIBED. THE

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:17.772
REST OF THE COUNTRY DOCTOR. OF

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:21.376
A SMELL- SHOWS THAT THE RATES

01:21:21.443 --> 01:21:23.845
ARE LOWER BUT THE RELY MORE ON.

01:21:23.912 --> 01:21:29.217
ALSO FUELS AND SAID. SO I GUESS

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:31.353
I AM PART OF MY- QUESTION I

01:21:31.419 --> 01:21:38.193
pTIPPING POINT ON PRICES AND-

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.628
ARE WE WERE OR ARE WE ARE THIS

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:41.930
SIDE TIPPING. AND THE COST

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:46.334
VERSE. THE GHG PROGRAM AND HOW

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:48.370
WE'RE TRYING TO- CERTAINLY

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:50.338
ADDRESS IT INCIDENT THE SECTORS

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:51.740
WHERE IT'S CERTAINLY MOST

01:21:51.806 --> 01:21:52.107
INTENSE LIKE AND

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:55.076
TRANSPORTATION. ARE WE GET INTO

01:21:55.143 --> 01:22:03.051
A TIPPING POINT. THANK. YEAH I

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:06.621
I'M I'M I WE RISK WE RISK GOING

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:08.423
BEYOND IT WE MAY BE WE MAY BE

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:09.791
BEYOND THE TIPPING POINT I

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:10.925
GUESS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SORT

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:12.994
OF TIP PEOPLE BACK INTO A

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:14.296
DIRECTION THAT THEY'VE NEVER

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:16.097
BEEN IN TERMS OF CERTAINLY

01:22:16.164 --> 01:22:18.233
ELECTRIFY TRANSPORTATION AND-

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:23.238
HOME HE AND- WATER HEATING. AND

01:22:23.305 --> 01:22:25.940
MAYBE WE CAN STILL DO IT BUT IT

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:29.311
SURE IS A LOT HARDER WHEN THE-

01:22:29.377 --> 01:22:31.379
PRICES ARE AS MISALIGNED AS

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:33.915
WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN DISCUSSING-

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:36.051
AND EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE HEARD

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:37.686
IMPLIES THAT THAT SITUATION IS

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:39.854
PROBABLY GONNA GET WORSE

01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:43.491
UNLESS- WE START. SERIOUSLY

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:44.826
ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ROOT

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.161
CAUSES OF WHERE THAT

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:50.498
MISALIGNMENT CAME FROM- I THINK

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:55.737
IT AS WE DE CARBON EYES- BATES.

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.439
IT IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:59.874
ELECTRICITY PRICES BUT IT'S NOT

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:01.576
NEARLY THE SOLE SOURCE OF IT

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:02.811
ESPECIALLY IF WE COULD DO THE

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:04.813
D. CARBONIZATION AND- IN IS

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:07.482

MISS RADIUS- TOUCHED ON IT

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:26.901
EARLIER WHEN. THE PRESIDENT PC

01:23:30.004 --> 01:23:32.207
REMINDED US THAT THE WELFARE

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:34.409
MITIGATION PLANS AND THOSE

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:36.211
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT FOR

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:41.750

01:23:45.253 --> 01:23:47.822
JUST SEEMS LIKE FOR EVERY GOOD

01:23:47.889 --> 01:23:49.023

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:49.758
APPROPRIATE AS WE'VE BEEN HIT

01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:51.493
VERY HARD BY THESE WILDFIRES

AND UTILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN.

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:54.796
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COSTS AND

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.664
NEEDING TO DO UPGRADES IN ART

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:57.665
IN THE GRID THESE ARE ALL VERY

01:23:57.732 --> 01:23:59.667
IMPORTANT THINGS CLEARING OUT.

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:03.204

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:38.032
WORKED YOU KNOW IT'S WORKED AT

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:39.934
ME WE ARE SEEING CONTINUED

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:41.068
GROWTH IN WITHIN THE SOLAR

01:30:41.135 --> 01:30:43.404
INDUSTRY AND WE'RE VERY

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:45.973
SUPPORTIVE OF IT BUT NOW IT THE

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.675
TIME LIKE THAT FOR STATE.

01:30:47.742 --> 01:30:49.277
STARTING TO AT. PERFORMING

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:51.345
DOING AWAY WITH THE ELIMINATING

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:53.214
CHANGING- THIS NET ENERGY

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:55.483
METERING POLICY AND WE THINK

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:56.617
IT'S TIME FOR THE STATE OF

01:30:56.684 --> 01:30:57.852
CALIFORNIA TO LOOK AS WELL SO I

01:30:57.919 --> 01:30:59.187
JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR AND

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:01.155
REEMPHASIZE AND JUST BASED ON

01:31:01.222 --> 01:31:02.924
NOT QUICK DATA THAT YOU JUST

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.358
RECEIVED. THERE IS

01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:05.927
APPROXIMATELY TWO DOLLARS HARD

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:07.361
WORKING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:09.764
THAT ARE SUBSIDIZING THOSE THAT

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:11.599
ALREADY HAVE SOLAR POWER AND

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:12.300
THEY'RE NOT PAYING THEIR FIR

01:31:12.366 --> 01:31:14.735
SHARE AND GREAT THAT RIGHT THAT

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:20.141
THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU.

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:23.277
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID. I AM AND

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:25.046
IT MAKES IT EVEN WORSE THAT THE

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:26.848
ENERGY COMMISSION IS NOW

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:27.982
TELLING PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEW

01:31:28.049 --> 01:31:29.784
HOMES WE'RE CERTAINLY ABOVE

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:31.652
AVERAGE AND THEY'RE ABLE TO BUY

01:31:31.719 --> 01:31:33.221
A HOME AT ALL PROBABLY IN THE

01:31:33.287 --> 01:31:35.957
TOP FEW PER EARNERS THEY'RE

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:37.458
GOING TO GET MORE OF THOSE

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:40.094
SUBSIDIES BECAUSE THE DEMANDING

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:42.997
THAT THEY PUT ON ROOFTOPS SO.

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:43.631
THIS IS COURSE ALSO RATING THE

01:31:43.698 --> 01:31:45.900
COST TO THE HOUSING- WHICH IS A

01:31:45.967 --> 01:31:47.368
VERY BAD THING GIVEN THAT WE'RE

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:52.540
TRYING TO BUILD MORE OF IT. AND.

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:54.609
IT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE A LOT

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:58.312
OF SENSE WHAT I WANTED TO. ASK

01:31:58.379 --> 01:32:00.548
THE RATE THE YOU'RE NO LONGER

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:02.016
RATE PAYER ADVOCATES YOU THE

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:05.620
PUBLIC ADVOCATES- HAVE YOU AS

01:32:05.686 --> 01:32:08.189
PUBLIC ADVOCATES ARE TAKEN LOOK

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:12.793
AT THIS ISSUE- OF THE- ENERGY

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:15.196
COMMISSION. WELL FIRST OF ALL

01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:16.197
WE'VE ALREADY AGREED WE'RE

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:18.532
GOING 2100% RENEWABLES SO WHAT

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:20.434
QUESTION IS DO WE DO WITH THE

01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:22.103
MOST EXPENSIVE WAY WHICH IS

01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:23.971
ROOF TOP SELLER OR LESS

01:32:24.038 --> 01:32:26.540
EXPENSIVE WAYS SUCH AS OFFSHORE

01:32:26.607 --> 01:32:30.244
WIND. SOLAR FARMS IN PARTICULAR

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:33.114
WHICH IS SEVERAL TIMES CHEAPER-

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:36.217
HAS THE- OUR PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S

01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:39.654
OFFICE LOOKED AT THIS AND- HAVE

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:40.821
THEY TALKED WITH THE ENERGY

01:32:40.888 --> 01:32:41.756
COMMISSION ABOUT THESE

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:44.926
UNNECESSARY- COST THEY'RE

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:49.130
PUTTING ON RATE PAYERS. WE'RE

01:32:49.196 --> 01:32:51.632
LOOKING AT THE COSTS OF ROOFTOP

01:32:51.699 --> 01:32:54.468
SOLAR AND THE ENERGY MEETING

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:56.604
SPECIFICALLY AND THE ISSUES RUN

01:32:56.671 --> 01:32:59.006
COST SHIFTING OF WE WERE

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:00.775
LOOKING FORWARD VERY MUCH TO

01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:04.178
THE PC'S REVISIT OF THE ISSUE

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:05.980
OF I CAN TELL YOU WE ARE

01:33:06.047 --> 01:33:07.548
ACTIVELY AS WE SPEAK WE HAVE A

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:09.750
TEAM OF ANALYSTS. TRYING TO

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:12.086
COME UP WITH OPTIONS AND HOW TO

01:33:12.153 --> 01:33:14.221
DEAL WITH THAT COST BURDEN OKAY

01:33:14.288 --> 01:33:16.390
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ENERGY

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:17.525
COMMISSION'S MANDATE TO MAKE

01:33:17.591 --> 01:33:20.261
THE SITUATION EVEN WORSE. HI

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:21.762
YOU HAVE OU TALKED WITH THE

01:33:21.829 --> 01:33:23.631
ENERGY COMMISSION ABOUT. REALLY

01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:25.032
YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:26.634
ABOUT THE COSTS THAT YOU PUT ON

01:33:26.701 --> 01:33:28.703
CUSTOMERS. WITH WE HAVE NOT

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:31.572
DONE THAT THE WELL I THINK YOU

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:32.173
SHOULD I THINK THAT'S PART OF

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:35.242
YOUR- MANDATE. ARM THAT YOU ARE

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:36.978
THE ADVOCATES FOR THE RATE

01:33:37.044 --> 01:33:39.313
PAYERS AND THIS HELPS NO ONE

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.048
EXCEPT THE FEW PEOPLE CAN

01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:42.650
AFFORD TO BUY NEW HOMES TODAY.

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:45.753
NEW SO FAMILY HOMES THE TOP FEW

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.788
PERCENT OF EARNERS AND I JUST

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:50.057
DON'T THAT APPROPRIATE WAY AN

01:33:50.124 --> 01:33:54.795
APPROACH POLICY. THEOTHER

01:33:54.862 --> 01:33:57.198
POLICY AND PERHAPS DOCTOR BUSH

01:33:57.264 --> 01:33:59.066
NOW ONLY ALL YOU CAN SAY

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:01.035
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. ARM

01:34:01.102 --> 01:34:02.803
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU YOU'VE BEEN

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:05.306
INVOLVED WITH THE PEOPLE DOING

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:06.841
THIS RESEARCH AND YOU MAY HAVE

01:34:06.907 --> 01:34:09.577
BEEN ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS.

01:34:09.643 --> 01:34:11.679
THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT. THE

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:13.481
MONEY WE'RE SPENDING ON ENERGY

01:34:13.547 --> 01:34:17.218
CONSERVATION. OUR IS NOT PAYING

01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:19.153
OFF IN THE WAY THE CALCULATIONS

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:21.822
TALUS. THIS PROBABLY HAS TO DO

01:34:21.889 --> 01:34:22.823
WITH THE FACT THAT AN

01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:25.793
UNINSULATED BUILDING IS SIMPLY

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.061
A BETTER INSULATOR THAN WE

01:34:27.128 --> 01:34:28.763
THINK SO WHEN YOU ADD IN THE

01:34:28.829 --> 01:34:29.764
NATION IT MAKES LESS OF A

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:31.198
DIFFERENCE THAT'S AT LEAST ONE

01:34:31.265 --> 01:34:33.234
OF THE THEORIES. UP BUT

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:34.769
CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:39.407
WORK BY THE M. I. T. YOU SEE-

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:41.609
CHICAGO GROUP ON THIS LOOKING

01:34:41.675 --> 01:34:43.377
AT MID WESTERN STATES BUT WE

01:34:43.444 --> 01:34:45.546
ALSO HAVEINFORMATION ARE OUT

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:48.849
LOOKING AT FOLLOW UP HERE TO

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:51.185
THE WORK WE'RE DOING. WHERE THE

01:34:51.252 --> 01:34:53.254
COST OF GAS EXCUSE ME THE

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.222
REDUCTIONS IN GAS USAGE OR TWO

01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:57.758
OR THREE TIMES LESS THAN WE

01:34:57.825 --> 01:35:02.897
EXPECT. OUR ELECTRICITY. HAVE

01:35:02.963 --> 01:35:03.464
YOU HAVE YOU TAKEN A LOOK AT

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:08.135
THIS. SO I AM NOT ONE OF THE-

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:09.670
PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE THOSE

01:35:09.737 --> 01:35:11.739
STUDIES I AM CERTAINLY FAMILIAR

01:35:11.806 --> 01:35:14.608
WITH THEM- AND THE AYE THE

01:35:14.675 --> 01:35:15.776
STUDY TO REFERRING TO THERE'S A

01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:17.945
GENERAL SORT OF SET OF ATTEMPTS

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:19.246
TO TRY TO DO THINGS LIKE

01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:20.314
RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:21.615
AROUND ENERGIZED AGENCY

01:35:21.682 --> 01:35:24.118
PROGRAMS TO TRY TO. TO MEASURE

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:25.886
THE IMPACT AND A BIT MORE

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:27.521
RIGOROUS WAY AND THE GENERAL

01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:30.591
THEME RESULTS IS BEEN LESS

01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:32.793
EFFECTIVE THAN WHAT THE OF

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.161
STAND ENGINEERING ESTIMATES

01:35:34.228 --> 01:35:36.831
GOING IN WITH EXPECT AND SOME

01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:39.200
IS A LOT LESS EFFECTIVE- IT

01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:47.741
DOES. THE CALL- THIS DISCUSSION

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:50.111
TO THOSE COSTS ARE ALSO IN THE

01:35:50.177 --> 01:35:52.213
VARIABLE COMPONENT OF RATES AS

01:35:52.279 --> 01:35:54.148
WELL TO PAY FOR THOSE PROGRAMS.

01:35:54.215 --> 01:35:56.984
ALIENS A YEAR AND- AND AGAIN

01:35:57.051 --> 01:35:59.220
THERE ARE- THESE ARE COSTS THAT

01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:01.922
ARE NOT- CONTRIBUTED TO NEARLY

01:36:01.989 --> 01:36:03.924
AS MUCH BY SOLAR HOMES FOR

01:36:03.991 --> 01:36:06.260
EXAMPLE- BECAUSE OF THOSE COSTS

01:36:06.327 --> 01:36:09.563
BEING PART OF THE VARIABLE RATE

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:11.298
COMPONENTS. SO ITS THEY'RE

01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:12.533
THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF ELEMENTS

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.402
OF COST SHIFTS GOING ON WITHIN

01:36:15.469 --> 01:36:16.437
JUST FUNDING FOR THOSE TYPES OF

01:36:16.504 --> 01:36:17.972
PROGRAMS I THINK. SINCE ABOUT

01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:20.241
EXACTLY HOW MUCH SHOULD BE

01:36:20.307 --> 01:36:21.275
APPROACHED THE IMPLEMENTING

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:23.110
THOSE PROGRAMS AND IS ALSO REAL

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:25.513
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD

01:36:25.579 --> 01:36:27.314
TRY TO FUND THE PROGRAM IS ALL

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:28.048
AT LEAST THE ONES THAT WE THINK

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:31.318
ARE. ARE AFFECTED. YEAH SO NOT

01:36:31.385 --> 01:36:34.488
ALL. I REMEMBER I HAD WORK DONE

01:36:34.555 --> 01:36:37.191
ON MY OWN HOME AND THEY TOLD ME

01:36:37.258 --> 01:36:39.693
TO ADD MORE INSULATION FOR MY

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.595
TO MY CEILING WHEN I HEARD

01:36:41.662 --> 01:36:43.564
ALREADY OUR THIRTY SIX ARE THEY

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:46.233
TOLD ME TO PUT INSULATION

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:49.503
UNDERNEATH MY HOME WHEN THE

01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:52.573
HOME WAS ALREADY WELL INSULATED

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:56.644
FROM WIND AND- HAVE THE

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:58.879
FURNISHED DOWN THERE IT'S

01:36:58.946 --> 01:37:00.948
DIRECT. AND TO SO I PUT IN

01:37:01.015 --> 01:37:02.850
PLACE SHOULD UNDER HOW SUB INTO

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:05.553
MORE IN THE US BASICALLY I GOT

01:37:05.619 --> 01:37:11.625
NO- ENERGY SAVINGS- AND- THAT

01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:14.428
WAS VERY DISTURBING TO ME AND I

01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:15.563
THINK THAT'S PROBABLY HAPPENING

01:37:15.629 --> 01:37:18.499
A LOT. NOW GET PEOPLE HAVE DATA

01:37:18.566 --> 01:37:22.002
WHICH CONSERVATION EFFORTS HAVE

01:37:22.069 --> 01:37:24.171
THE BIGGEST PAY OFFS I KNOW

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:26.006
BERKELEY HAS LOOKED AT THIS AND

01:37:26.073 --> 01:37:29.843
THEY CAN TELL YOU- WHICH

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:32.947
WEAPONS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE

01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:34.181
WHICH ONES ARE LEAKED EFFECT

01:37:34.248 --> 01:37:36.317
OF. AND I THAT IS THIS IS IN A

01:37:36.383 --> 01:37:38.352
AREA AGAIN FOR THE PUBLIC

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:40.354
ADVOCATES TO LOOK. THAT WE

01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:42.456
OUGHT TO BE SPENDING MONEY ON

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:44.325
THE THINGS THAT WORK AND NOT

01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:47.027
MONEY ON THE THINGS THAT DON'T

01:37:47.094 --> 01:37:49.230
WORK. I YES I WHOLEHEARTEDLY

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:52.299
AGREE WITH YOU AND WE DO DO

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:54.168
THAT WORK IN TERMS OF. WHEN E

01:37:54.235 --> 01:37:56.470
SEE. PROPOSALS COME IN THE DOOR

01:37:56.537 --> 01:38:00.507
THE PC. AND WE ACTUALLY MONITOR

01:38:00.574 --> 01:38:01.408
VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:38:01.475 --> 01:38:04.912
ALREADY UNDER WAY RT BEING.

01:38:04.979 --> 01:38:06.347
SUPPORTED BUT WITH A PAIR

01:38:06.413 --> 01:38:08.282
FUNDING WE ARE TRACKING THE

01:38:08.349 --> 01:38:09.883
COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE

01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:11.719
PROGRAMS WHICH INCLUDES ARE

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:13.821
THOSE PROGRAMS WORKING ARE THEY

01:38:13.887 --> 01:38:17.024
DEMONSTRATING REAL BENEFITS TO

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:18.926
THE PUBLIC AND TO RATEPAYERS

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:21.729
AND THERE'S A LOT OF. IT OUT

01:38:21.795 --> 01:38:22.863
THERE FRANKLY RIGHT THERE ARE

01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:25.499
PROGRAMS THAT THAT ARE NOT COST

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:27.368
EFFECTIVE THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE

01:38:27.434 --> 01:38:28.869
OVERALL. HAVE YOU LOOKED

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:30.804
SPECIFICALLY AT SOME OF THE

01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:32.573
ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM WE

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.707
HAVE LOOKED WE HAVE AN ARE

01:38:33.774 --> 01:38:34.875
LOOKING AT ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:38:34.942 --> 01:38:37.111
SPECIFICALLY AND WE HAVE SOME

01:38:37.177 --> 01:38:38.646
CONCERNS THERE. OKAY GREAT

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:42.549
THANK YOU. AND IF I MAY THE ONE

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:45.052
OTHER- MAP THAT I DIDN'T

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:46.420
INCLUDE IN MY PRESENTATION THAT

01:38:46.487 --> 01:38:48.088
IS A BIT FRUSTRATING IS THAT

01:38:48.155 --> 01:38:49.590
THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:38:49.657 --> 01:38:51.091
EXPENDITURE ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:52.893
IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED ON THE

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:54.495
COASTS WHERE EXACTLY THE PLACES

01:38:54.561 --> 01:38:57.431
WHERE THE PRICES ARE. MAY

01:38:57.498 --> 01:38:59.400
EXTREMELY OVER PRICED- WHICH IS

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:00.601
PROBABLY THE LAST PLACE YOU

01:39:00.668 --> 01:39:02.136
WANT TO BE TRYING TO SUBSIDIZE

01:39:02.202 --> 01:39:03.537
ENERGY EFFICIENCY AS OPPOSED AS

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:04.405
PARTS OF MIDDLE OF THE CALL

01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:05.939
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S VERY TRUE

01:39:06.006 --> 01:39:07.274
BECAUSE IT'S THE PEOPLE ON THE

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:10.144
COAST WHO CAN AFFORD. TO ADD

01:39:10.210 --> 01:39:12.179
THE INSULATION AT CETERA AND

01:39:12.246 --> 01:39:13.480
YES THAT WAS ALSO ONE OF THE

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:16.216
FINDINGS. WHEN WE LOOKED AROUND

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:18.986
PROGRAM UP FINAL THING IS. TALK

01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:22.056
ABOUT FIXED COSTS. NOW I COULD

01:39:22.122 --> 01:39:24.558
ARGUE HAVE THIS HUGE VERY

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:27.294
EXPENSIVE ON BUT I'M USING LEDS

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:31.765
IN ITS NEW BE. ARM BILL SO I AM

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:33.467
USING. MAYBE EVEN LESS

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:37.037
ELECTRICITY THAN A MUCH SMALLER

01:39:37.104 --> 01:39:41.542
AND YET. WE IT'S VERY IT'S

01:39:41.608 --> 01:39:43.177
GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO FIGURE

01:39:43.243 --> 01:39:45.979
OUT HOW TO DO A FIXED COST

01:39:46.046 --> 01:39:47.381
BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:49.383
EVERYBODY GETS THE SAME LINE

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:50.984
COMING OUT HOUSE IS BEING

01:39:51.051 --> 01:39:53.721
EVERYBODY WHO HAS A LINE

01:39:53.787 --> 01:39:55.389
WHETHER IT'S- COUPLE. SQUARE

01:39:55.456 --> 01:39:57.858
FOOT TINY HAPS OR A FOUR

01:39:57.925 --> 01:40:01.295
THOUSAND- HOW SOME OF THESE-

01:40:01.362 --> 01:40:02.062
SIXTY THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT

01:40:02.129 --> 01:40:03.997
MANSIONS. THEY HAVE A LINE

01:40:04.064 --> 01:40:05.399
COMING OUT TO THEIR HOUSE IN

01:40:05.466 --> 01:40:06.500
THE CASE OF SIXTY THOUSAND

01:40:06.567 --> 01:40:08.001
SQUARE FOOT MANSION THEY MIGHT

01:40:08.068 --> 01:40:10.671
HAVE US A BIGGER LINED BUT- BY

01:40:10.738 --> 01:40:12.773
AND LARGE BETWEEN THE FOUR

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.375
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSE THE

01:40:14.441 --> 01:40:15.476
FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HOUSE.

01:40:15.542 --> 01:40:17.378
THE GONNA GET THE SAME LINE.

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:19.446
YET IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT THAT

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:21.849
THEY WOULD HAVE JUST BECAUSE OF

01:40:21.915 --> 01:40:23.384
EQUITY CONCERNS THAT THEY WOULD

01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:26.053
HAVE THE SAME THING CHARGE. ON

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.888
THE OTHER HAND THE PERSON WITH

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:29.390
THE FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:31.425
HOUSE THAT'S MORE RECENT BELT

01:40:31.492 --> 01:40:34.161
AND THEREFORE AND- IT'S MORE

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:36.296
FISH. WITH THEM A LADY'S

01:40:36.363 --> 01:40:41.101
FREEWARE IT SAT AROUND. ARM MAY

01:40:41.168 --> 01:40:45.072
PASS COOLEY. TERMS PASSIVE ET.

01:40:45.139 --> 01:40:46.573
ARE THEY MY NOT BE THAT MUCH

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:51.412
MORE THAN THE SMALLER. SO CAN I.

01:40:51.478 --> 01:40:53.480
DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS. ANYONE

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:54.348
HERE KNOW THOSE HOW TO DO A

01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:55.849
FIXED PRICE IN EQUITY WAY ARE

01:40:55.916 --> 01:40:57.551
FIX CHARGING EQUITABLE WAY THEY

01:40:57.618 --> 01:41:01.155
SHOULD SPEAK UP. I DON'T. HAVE

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:03.257
A SOLUTION I DO WANT TO AGREE

01:41:03.323 --> 01:41:05.459
WITH YOUR OBSERVATIONS- AND I

01:41:05.526 --> 01:41:07.661
ALSO THINK THAT THEY APPLY TO

01:41:07.728 --> 01:41:10.464
LOW USAGE CUSTOMERS. IN THAT

01:41:10.531 --> 01:41:13.500
FIGHT- SO I THINK YOU'RE ASKING

01:41:13.567 --> 01:41:15.169
THE SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:41:15.235 --> 01:41:17.271
QUESTION AND ULTIMATELY IF YOU

01:41:17.337 --> 01:41:19.173
ASK ANYBODY IN THE INDUSTRY WHO

01:41:19.239 --> 01:41:20.073
WORKS IN THIS SPACE YOU'RE

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:22.476
GONNA GET. ON TEN TEN DIFFERENT

01:41:22.543 --> 01:41:24.978
ANSWERS- BUT WE DO AGREE WITH

01:41:25.045 --> 01:41:27.781
YOU THAT- IF YOU LOOK KIND OF

01:41:27.848 --> 01:41:29.750
OUT INTO THE FUTURE AND AT THE

01:41:29.817 --> 01:41:30.717
SIDE MY COMMENTS EARLIER

01:41:30.784 --> 01:41:33.520
AROUND- NOT JUST MAYBE A

01:41:33.587 --> 01:41:35.122
SPECIFIC FIX CHARGE BUT REALLY

01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:37.057
MOVING MORE. ENERGY PRICING IS

01:41:37.124 --> 01:41:38.492
KIND OF A FIX SUBSCRIPTION

01:41:38.559 --> 01:41:41.462
BASIS. WHERE YOU COULD DESIGN

01:41:41.528 --> 01:41:43.864
RATES IN A WAY THAT TAKES THAT

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:45.799
INTO CONSIDERATION WHETHER IT'S

01:41:45.866 --> 01:41:48.335
BY. A AUDIT CAPACITY BASIS

01:41:48.402 --> 01:41:49.169
MEANING HOW MUCH ENERGY ARE YOU

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:51.905
ACTUALLY SUING- IN YOUR HOME

01:41:51.972 --> 01:41:54.575
COULD YOU- COULD YOU SCALE UP

01:41:54.641 --> 01:41:56.543
BASED UPON YOU THE SIZE YOUR

01:41:56.610 --> 01:41:58.412
HOME OR YOU KNOW DON'T. ENERGY

01:41:58.479 --> 01:42:00.581
USAGE COULD YOU RESET THAT

01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:01.615
EVERY YEAR BASED UPON HOW MUCH

01:42:01.682 --> 01:42:03.450
YOU USE AND COULD YOU ALSO HAVE

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:05.686
MEANS TESTED SO MEANING WE

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.120
STILL HAVE WE STILL COULD PUT

01:42:07.187 --> 01:42:12.359
IN PLACE- DISCOUNTS FOR OUR LOW

01:42:12.426 --> 01:42:13.694
INCOME CUSTOMERS AS WELL SO. I

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:19.233
THINK IT MAY. SEE YOU TAPE

01:42:19.299 --> 01:42:21.034
SCRIPT SHIN KICKS LIKE ME BUT

01:42:21.101 --> 01:42:26.907
ALL IN A- HE ANY POP THAT ONE

01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:28.342
TO. YOU KNOW CORD. CUSTOM WELL

01:42:28.408 --> 01:42:29.510
BUT AGAIN THE RICH GUY WITH

01:42:29.576 --> 01:42:31.411
CELL IS FOR NAY EVEN ELECT.

01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:32.880
BILL RIGHT WELL YOU HAVE ONE

01:42:32.946 --> 01:42:33.881
BUT DON'T PAY VERY MUCH YOU

01:42:33.947 --> 01:42:35.449
COULD NOT BEAR AGAIN THAT WOULD

01:42:35.516 --> 01:42:37.518
ASSUME YOU'RE ALSO REFORMING

01:42:37.584 --> 01:42:39.086
THAT ENERGY METERING AND YOU'RE

01:42:39.152 --> 01:42:39.953
REALLY LOOKING AT KIND OF THE

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.989
TRUE CONSUMPTION OF THE HOME.

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:44.091
AND NOT JUST HOW UNIT NETTING

01:42:44.157 --> 01:42:46.226
OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:48.862
WHAT YOU'RE PAYING US TO JENNY

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:49.396
AND WHAT YOU'RE GENERATING

01:42:49.463 --> 01:42:50.197
WITHIN YOUR PANELS. DID YOU

01:42:50.264 --> 01:42:52.232
HAVE ANOTHER COMMENT. FOR

01:42:52.299 --> 01:42:54.101
PUBLIC ADVOCATE SIDE TOO I JUST

01:42:54.167 --> 01:42:55.569
WANT TO I WANT TO BE CAREFUL

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:57.437
NOT TO LOOK AT FIX CHARGES AS A

01:42:57.504 --> 01:43:01.108
PANACEA OF FOR HIGH RATES OF

01:43:01.174 --> 01:43:02.242
AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO A COMMENT

01:43:02.309 --> 01:43:04.044
I MADE EARLIER ABOUT LOOKING AT

01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:06.680
CUSTOMERS BILLS AND THE CONCERN

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:09.550
THAT THAT YOU YOU EXPRESSED OF

01:43:09.616 --> 01:43:11.785
DOVETAILS WITH ANOTHER CONCERN

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:13.587
WHICH IS WHEN I SAY LOW USAGE

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:14.621
CUSTOMERS I'M TALKING ABOUT

01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:16.890
CUSTOMERS WHO USE BELOW AT AT

01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:19.693
THE BASE LINE. LOWER QUANTITY

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.095
UP ELECTRICITY THAT THEY COULD

01:43:22.162 --> 01:43:24.598
BE HIT WITH HIGH FIXED. CHARGES

01:43:24.665 --> 01:43:27.167
SEE HOW TO BE VERY CAREFUL

01:43:27.234 --> 01:43:27.768
ABOUT HOW YOU STRUCTURE

01:43:27.834 --> 01:43:29.503
SOETHING LIKE THAT. RIGHT NOW

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:31.572
WE HAVE A MINIMUM BILL TO TAKE

01:43:31.638 --> 01:43:32.839
CARE OF THE SITUATION WHERE A

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:35.208
CUSTOMER PAYS. A MODEST MINIMUM

01:43:35.275 --> 01:43:38.378
BILL OF FOR A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF

01:43:38.445 --> 01:43:42.316
ENERGY. WE THINK THAT. THAT IS

01:43:42.382 --> 01:43:43.250
A BETTER WAY TO GO AND IT

01:43:43.317 --> 01:43:45.852
DOESN'T PENALIZE LOW USAGE

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:50.490
CUSTOMERS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:52.759
QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS AT THIS

01:43:52.826 --> 01:43:55.596
TIME IF NOT I'M GOING TO TURN

01:43:55.662 --> 01:43:57.297
TO THE PUBLIC IF OUR PANELISTS

01:43:57.364 --> 01:43:58.498
CAN JUST REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE

01:43:58.565 --> 01:44:01.201
WILL. TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT- AND

01:44:01.268 --> 01:44:02.603
THEN WE'LL TURN BACK TO MEMBERS

01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:04.504
IF THEY HAVE ANY OTHER THOUGHT

01:44:04.571 --> 01:44:05.606
THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SHARE AT

01:44:05.672 --> 01:44:07.174
THAT TIME SO WILL. WELCOME

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:10.243
THOSE WHO WERE. I WANTED TO

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:13.447
SHARE A THOUGHT. GOT ABOUT A

01:44:13.513 --> 01:44:18.652
MINUTE TWO MINUTES AT THE MOST.

01:44:18.719 --> 01:44:19.653
PATRICK WELL TO THE CALIFORNIA

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:21.388
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES CESSATION

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:22.556
ONE I THINK THAT CHAIR AND

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:23.790
COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR PUTTING

01:44:23.857 --> 01:44:24.691
TOGETHER THIS IMPORTANT

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:27.928
HEARING. WE AGREE WITH THAT

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:29.529
ELECTRIC AFFORDABILITY IN

01:44:29.596 --> 01:44:31.598
CONJUNCTION WITH RELIABILITY

01:44:31.665 --> 01:44:33.200
AND SUSTAINABILITY IS REALLY

01:44:33.266 --> 01:44:34.668
CRITICAL I WAS MENTIONED IN THE

01:44:34.735 --> 01:44:36.637
LA AS WE ARE BY MISTER BROWN

01:44:36.703 --> 01:44:38.271
THAT WAS DISCUSSED HERE THAT

01:44:38.338 --> 01:44:39.272
ELECTRICITY PRICES IF THEY'RE

01:44:39.339 --> 01:44:40.674
HIGHER COULD BE A BARRIER TO

01:44:40.741 --> 01:44:42.209
FUTURE GHG REDUCTIONS WE

01:44:42.275 --> 01:44:43.410
CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:44.678
CONCLUSION. THE GOVERNOR

01:44:44.745 --> 01:44:47.814
RECENTLY HE SAID HIMSELF THAT.

01:44:47.881 --> 01:44:48.582
ELECTRICITY IS THE ARCHITECTURE

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:49.783
OF TRANSFORMING THE

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:52.819
TRANSPORTATION FLEET WHERE 41%

01:44:52.886 --> 01:44:53.286
OF THE MISSIONS ARE SO

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:54.154
CERTAINLY WE THINK THAT'S

01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:55.055
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:57.591
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. AND

01:44:57.658 --> 01:44:58.058
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:44:58.125 --> 01:44:59.760
DISCUSSION ABOUT RATES FOR HIS

01:44:59.826 --> 01:45:00.861
BILL. TEAMMATES PERSPECTIVE WE

01:45:00.927 --> 01:45:03.163
THINK RATES AND BILLS MATTER AT

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:03.897
CALIFORNIA IS A VERY

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:05.332
GEOGRAPHICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY

01:45:05.399 --> 01:45:07.968
DIVERSE STATE- ARBORS BE A

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:09.136
FORTY FIVE MEMBERS ACROSS THE

01:45:09.202 --> 01:45:13.073
STATE AND YOU KNOW WHERE IT ONE

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:13.940
STATE AT A BILL MIGHT BE LEFT

01:45:14.007 --> 01:45:15.575
ANOTHER PART OF THIS MY BEHIND

01:45:15.642 --> 01:45:18.545
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. EIGHT

01:45:18.612 --> 01:45:19.913
BILLS TOGETHER I DON'T THINK WE

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:23.250
CAN THEM IN SILOS. I AM JUST IT

01:45:23.316 --> 01:45:23.950
AND NOW IT'S JUST ABOUT. WAS

01:45:24.017 --> 01:45:25.752
THAT IT TODAY WAS ON I OWE YOU

BATES JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A

01:45:26.386 --> 01:45:27.220
LITTLE. FOR THE MUNICIPAL AS

01:45:27.287 --> 01:45:29.523
WELL- BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND

01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:30.590
EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN.

01:45:30.657 --> 01:45:32.893
YOU RESIDENTIAL RATES ROSE BY

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:34.861
27% WHICH FAR OUTPACED THE

01:45:34.928 --> 01:45:38.465
RISING Q. U. RATES NATIONWIDE-

01:45:38.532 --> 01:45:39.566
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BASED ON

01:45:39.633 --> 01:45:41.301
AVERAGES APPEAR YOU RESIDENTIAL

01:45:41.368 --> 01:45:42.769
BILLS TWENTY WAS NINETY TWO

01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:45.105
DOLLARS. BUT NATIONALLY THE

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:46.239
AVERAGE BILL WITH SIXTY FIVE

01:45:46.306 --> 01:45:47.941
DOLLARS TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:50.343
IN CALIFORNIA. DESPITE THE RISE

01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:55.048
IN RATES. USE THAT HAVE- A 15%

01:45:55.115 --> 01:45:56.583
LOWER THAN I OWE YOU RATE. WE

01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:57.951
WOULD LIKE TO KEEP THEM LAW BUT

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:03.190
THE TO. LA JUST MANDATE IS IN

01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:06.426
TRANSMISSION ACCESS ANOTHER

01:46:06.493 --> 01:46:08.161
PRESSURE. ABOUT AND WE NEED TO

01:46:08.228 --> 01:46:11.598
SEE. CAUGHT SIZE ALSO THE

01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:12.365
ELECTRIC SECTORS ON AND RIGHT I

01:46:12.432 --> 01:46:15.702
THINK THE TOUCH. BETWEEN TWENTY

01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:16.269
ELEVEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN GHG

01:46:16.336 --> 01:46:17.104
REDUCTIONS FROM THE MISSION

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:19.039
SECTOR 30% TRANSPORTATION

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:21.007
SECTOR EMISSIONS ACTUALLY ROSE

01:46:21.074 --> 01:46:23.477
5% DURING THAT TIME. AND WE

01:46:23.543 --> 01:46:24.511
THINK ELECTRIC SECTOR WILL

01:46:24.578 --> 01:46:25.846
CONTINUE TO LEAD EMISSION

01:46:25.912 --> 01:46:27.247
REDUCTIONS AND ALSO HELP

01:46:27.314 --> 01:46:28.882
ACHIEVE REDUCTIONS IN OTHER

01:46:28.949 --> 01:46:30.283
SECTORS LIKE TRANSPORTATION BUT

01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:32.018
AFFORDABILITY MUST REMAIN FRONT

01:46:32.085 --> 01:46:33.653
AND CENTER WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:35.555
COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. AND

01:46:35.622 --> 01:46:36.156
MAINTAINING PLANNING

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:37.791
FLEXIBILITY IS FOR UTILITIES TO

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.426
THE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:41.428
DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO RESOLVE

01:46:41.495 --> 01:46:42.629
SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS A FOR

01:46:42.696 --> 01:46:44.297
TODAY'S TO REALLY PREPARE TIME.

01:46:44.364 --> 01:46:47.234
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.769
AFTERNOON GERALD AND ALEX

01:46:48.835 --> 01:46:51.104
JACKSON WITH AN RTC I AM ONE OF

01:46:51.171 --> 01:46:52.572
THOSE ENVIRONMENTALISTS TODAY

01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:54.508
DR BUSHNELL'S POINT BUT I AGREE

01:46:54.574 --> 01:46:57.210
THAT THE ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE

01:46:57.277 --> 01:46:59.146
TOO DARN HIGH TODAY AND SHARE

01:46:59.212 --> 01:46:59.746
THE CONCERNS OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:46:59.813 --> 01:47:01.181
THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:02.549
HAMPERED PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY

01:47:02.616 --> 01:47:04.151
IN OUR ABILITY TO ELECTRIFY

01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:06.153
MORE AND USES IF WE MAKE THE

01:47:06.219 --> 01:47:07.220
PRICE OF ELECTRICITY

01:47:07.287 --> 01:47:08.722
PROHIBITIVELY EXENSIVE AT THE

01:47:08.789 --> 01:47:10.791
SAME TIME. WILDFIRES IS MAKING

01:47:10.857 --> 01:47:12.759
IT LESS RELY SO WE KNOW FOR

01:47:12.826 --> 01:47:14.327
EXAMPLE THE NUMBER ONE REASON

01:47:14.394 --> 01:47:16.329
PEOPLE BUY ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:17.631
THE FUEL COST SAVINGS RELATIVE

01:47:17.697 --> 01:47:19.566
TO GASOLINE- SO AGAIN IF TO

01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:21.434
PRESENT TRENDS CONTINUE WE SEE

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:23.403
REAL APPAREL FOR OUR

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:26.273
ELECTRIFICATION AGENDA- AGREE

01:47:26.339 --> 01:47:28.008
WITH ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:47:28.074 --> 01:47:30.043
YOU FOR TODAY- SHOULD BE LOOKED

01:47:30.110 --> 01:47:31.745
TO TAKE THINGS OUT OF THE RATE

01:47:31.812 --> 01:47:33.547
BASE THAT DON'T REALLY HAVE TO

01:47:33.613 --> 01:47:35.982
BE A READ EITHER. PROGRAMS WITH

01:47:36.049 --> 01:47:39.953
ON THE STATE BUDGET. AND SIR.

01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:41.354
I'M DIGGING A HOLE NOT MAKE IT

01:47:41.421 --> 01:47:42.656
IN WORSE BUT- I ONE HUNDRED

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:43.757
WHAT WE SEE IS A REAL. MOVING

01:47:43.824 --> 01:47:44.991
FORWARD IN THE EXPLODING COSTS

01:47:45.058 --> 01:47:46.326
POTENTIALLY IN RATES AND THAT

01:47:46.393 --> 01:47:48.061
IS FIRE MITIGATION. AS YOU

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:49.362
NOTED EVERY BILLION DOLLARS

01:47:49.429 --> 01:47:51.765
FROM P. GENIES EXPERIENCES- 7%

01:47:51.832 --> 01:47:53.733
BILL INCREASE. THEY RECENTLY

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:56.069
FILED THEIR TWENTY TWENTY TO

01:47:56.136 --> 01:47:56.670
TWENTY TWENTY THREE WILD FIRE

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:57.704
MITIGATION PLANS PROPOSING TO

01:47:57.771 --> 01:47:59.172
SPEND. SEVEN POINT EIGHT

01:47:59.239 --> 01:48:01.208
BILLION DOLLARS SO DO THE MATH

01:48:01.274 --> 01:48:02.108
AND THAT'S COMPLETELY NOT

01:48:02.175 --> 01:48:03.844
SUSTAINABLE UNDER TRADITIONAL.

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:05.512
RATE MAKING SO WE REALLY WANT

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:07.447
ENCOURAGED THIS BOBBY TO THINK

01:48:07.514 --> 01:48:08.682
ABOUT HOW CAN WE FINANCE.

01:48:08.748 --> 01:48:11.518
SYSTEM HARDENING USED. FOR SAVE

01:48:11.585 --> 01:48:13.420
LIABILITY. OUTSIDE OF LET

01:48:13.486 --> 01:48:15.422
GRADES. THROUGH OTHER SOURCES

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:17.324
OR OTHER WAYS OF NANCY DOESN'T.

01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:20.026
IMPACT NOW THIS BILL SWEEPING

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:24.164
TO ELECTRICITY AND ARE CLEAN

01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:24.798
AND RELIABLE ENERGY SOURCE. AND

01:48:24.865 --> 01:48:26.766
I'LL TO LEAVE YOU WITH SOME OF.

01:48:26.833 --> 01:48:28.768
YOU COULD THINK ABOUT YOU NEED

01:48:28.835 --> 01:48:29.870
TO CONVINCE YOU THIS MR HOLE

01:48:29.936 --> 01:48:31.471
BUT I. AFTER EVERYONE THAT WE

01:48:31.538 --> 01:48:33.306
COULD. ABOUT WAYS TO BE MORE

01:48:33.373 --> 01:48:35.876
EFFICIENT IN OUR WESTERN GRIP-

01:48:35.942 --> 01:48:37.644
WE THINK WE'VE SEEN THE-

01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:38.912
DEMONSTRATED SAVINGS FROM THE

01:48:38.979 --> 01:48:40.580
ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET THE

01:48:40.647 --> 01:48:41.214
SAVINGS THAT PROVIDES TO

01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:43.049
CUSTOMERS WE- CONTINUE TO THINK

01:48:43.116 --> 01:48:44.784
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO LOOK AT

01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:46.052
THOSE INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS AS

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:47.687
WE LOOK AT. HIGHER RISK POOL OF

01:48:47.754 --> 01:48:49.356
PRETTY. EDUCATION STATE. BUT

01:48:49.422 --> 01:48:50.790

01:48:52.959 --> 01:48:54.060
DYSTOPIAN FUTURE WE'RE TALKING

01:48:54.127 --> 01:48:55.528
ABOUT WHERE WE'RE LETTING.

01:48:55.595 --> 01:48:58.598
CLIMATE NEWS WILDFIRES MAKE OUR

01:48:58.665 --> 01:49:01.468
LOOKS. MORE PENSIVE LESS

01:49:01.534 --> 01:49:03.169
RELIABLE MEANS OF THE CARLO

01:49:03.236 --> 01:49:06.573
TING. POSITIVE STORY THE MORE

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.041
WE AND BETTER ACTUALLY. AND

VEHICLE. IS A PUTS DOWN

01:49:09.643 --> 01:49:11.011
PRESSURE ON RATES FOR EVERYBODY

01:49:11.077 --> 01:49:12.846
AND WE JUST PUT A STUDY OUT.

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:14.547
THE ELECTRICITY JOURNAL THE

01:49:14.614 --> 01:49:15.282
LOOK AT P. GINNY SERVICE

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:17.751
TERRITORY. IF THEY DID SMART

01:49:17.817 --> 01:49:19.219
OCCASION AND THEIR SERVICE

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:20.420
TERRITORY THEY COULD REDUCE.

01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:24.090
COST IMPACT FROM WILDFIRE. 28%

01:49:24.157 --> 01:49:25.425
DOWN TO NINE PERCENT. SO THESE

01:49:25.492 --> 01:49:26.559
ARE THINGS WE NEED TO MAKE

01:49:26.626 --> 01:49:27.994
HAPPEN WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO
