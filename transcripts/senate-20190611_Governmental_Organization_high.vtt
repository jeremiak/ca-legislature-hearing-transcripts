OTHER BILL PASSES.

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:47.473

GET THEM TO KEEP THE INTEGRITY

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:32.711
OF THE LIQUOR LICENSE BECAUSE IT

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:33.612

ARE LEGIT.

00:25:06.104 --> 00:25:07.572
THE PROBLEM IS THIS BILL DOES

NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:10.909

NOTES LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BILL.

00:25:14.412 --> 00:25:15.180
IF YOU THINK THIS BILL WILL

STATEWIDE

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.985
BUILDINGS IT WON'T BECAUSE THERE

ACROSS THE STATE THAN EVER

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:27.626
BEFORE AND NONE OF IT REQUIRED

00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:29.194
WHAT THIS BILL IS OFFERING TO

00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:30.662
PRODUCE THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:31.796
ASSUMPTION OF THIS BILL THAT WE

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:33.665
DON'T HAVE THE DATA WERE THAT WE

00:25:33.732 --> 00:25:35.133
NEED SACRAMENTO TO PROVIDE IT.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.735
IS SIMPLY WRONG IF YOU THINK

00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:37.836
THIS BILL WILL PRODUCE USEFUL

00:25:37.903 --> 00:25:39.838
DATA IT WILL NOT USEFUL DATE IS

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:41.306
NOT JUST ACCOUNT OF BUILDINGS

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:42.474
WITH NO CONTEXT WE KNOW THIS

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.743
FROM PAST STATEWIDE EFFORTS AND

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:45.277
FROM MY WORK WITH VARIOUS

00:25:45.343 --> 00:25:46.211
JURISDICTIONS.

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:47.913
SEAT WIDE INVENTORIES DO NOT

00:25:47.979 --> 00:25:49.147
PRODUCE INFORMATION THAT IS

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:50.482
USEFUL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:25:50.548 --> 00:25:52.083
WHATEVER IS PRODUCED BY THIS

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.351
BILL WILL HAVE TO BE RE DONE BY

00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:59.724
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BEFORE THEY

00:25:59.791 --> 00:26:00.659
CAN EVEN USE IT.

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:01.326
IF YOU THINK THIS BILL WILL

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:02.327
ACTIVATE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DO

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:03.128
THAT WORK IT WILL NOT MORE TO

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:03.929
IMPLEMENT RECORD FOR PROGRAMS IT

00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:04.696
WILL NOT ON THE COUNTRY THIS

00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:05.664
BILL GIVES MOST JURISDICTIONS

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.966
PERMISSION TO DO NOTHING FOR

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:09.134
THREE YEARS.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.702
IN FACT WE KNOW THE CAL BONES IN

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:12.370
THEIR STATEMENT HAS SAID THE

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:13.905
REASON THEY SUPPORT THE BILL IS

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:15.807
BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER UNFUNDED

00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:16.975
MANDATE WHICH MEANS THEY DON'T

00:26:17.042 --> 00:26:18.410
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY

00:26:18.476 --> 00:26:19.377
THINK THE STATE.

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:20.478
IS GOING TO DO THEIR WORK FOR

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:21.880
THEM THIS BILL BECAUSE OF THAT

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:23.148
COULD ACTUALLY STOP.

00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:24.649
MORE RISK REDUCTION THEN IT

00:26:24.716 --> 00:26:26.184
STARTS IF YOU THINK THE BILL

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:27.485
WILL BE MORE FEASIBLE OR COST

00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:28.620
EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THE WORK IS

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:30.155
BEING DONE BY THE STATE INSTEAD

00:26:30.221 --> 00:26:31.723
OF BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:32.757
IT WON'T.

00:26:32.824 --> 00:26:34.793
ANY EMPHASIS ON UNIFORMITY HERE

00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:36.895
IS ENTIRELY MISPLACED AS WE CAN

00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:38.430
PROVE BY LOOKING AT ALL THE SOFT

00:26:38.496 --> 00:26:40.131
STORY PROGRAMS AND RIGHT NOW IN

00:26:40.198 --> 00:26:41.466
EFFECT AROUND THE STATE.

00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:43.335
ALL OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT ALL

00:26:43.401 --> 00:26:44.669
THE MAKE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION

00:26:44.736 --> 00:26:46.438
OF THE BUILDING ALL OF THEM ARE

00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:48.373
ON EFFECTIVE HOWEVER BECAUSE

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.208
THEY ARE CUSTOMIZED AT THE LOCAL

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:51.276
LEVEL.

00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:52.644
INVENTORY IS MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:53.979
THE WORKS WITH LOCAL RECORDS AND

00:26:54.045 --> 00:26:57.983
LOCAL EXPERTISE WHICH THIS BILL

00:26:58.049 --> 00:26:59.818
EXPLICITLY RULES OUT.

00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:00.485
FINALLY IN SUMMARY IF YOU THINK

00:27:00.552 --> 00:27:01.152
THIS BILL IS A GOOD WAY TO SPEND

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:02.153
A FEW MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.321
YOU INTERESTED IN EARTHQUAKE

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:04.389
SAFETY WORST CHRISTMAS

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:05.824
PRODUCTION I HOPE I'VE SHOWN YOU

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.492
WHY IT'S NOT GOOD INTENTIONS

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:08.860
ALONE DO NOT MAKE.

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:11.329
GOOD POLICY AGAIN FIRST STEP

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:13.164
KALRA FIRST STEP IF YOU WANT

00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:13.965
IT'S A FIRST STEP IN THE WRONG

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:15.600
DIRECTION NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:17.702
THINGS THE STATE CAN DO. TO HELP

00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:18.536
INVENTORY EFFORTS AND TO HELP

00:27:18.603 --> 00:27:19.738
LOWER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUT

00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:21.206
THEY ALL START WITH RECOGNIZING

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:22.307
THIS KEY TRUTH.

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:24.042
WITH QUICK MITIGATION IN

00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:26.311

IMPLEMENTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:31.983
SO ANYTHING THAT'S PRODUCED FROM

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.151
THIS BILL WILL HAVE TO BE RE

00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:34.552
DONE NO MATTER IF YOU GIVE IT TO

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:36.454
THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MOST

00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:37.088
DON'T WANT IT THEY'RE NOT GOING

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.123
TO TAKE IT.

00:27:38.189 --> 00:27:39.224
I CAN COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:40.225
THE SUPPORTERS IN THE OTHER

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:41.993

YEARS TO PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.822

AND IT GOING IN THE WRONG

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:36.815
DIRECTION I'M NOT CERTAIN I

00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:37.749
UNDERSTAND PLACE MAKING TWO

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:39.050
MISTAKES IS FOCUSING THE EFFORT

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:40.218
AT THE STATE LEVEL WHEN ALL THE

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:41.453
REAL WORK IS GOING TO BE DONE

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:42.787
AND ALL THE USE OF THE DATA IS

00:28:42.854 --> 00:28:44.055
PRODUCED BY THIS WILL HAVE TO BE

00:28:44.122 --> 00:28:44.489
DONE AT THE LOCAL.

00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:45.824
LEVEL AND A HUGE OPPORTUNITY

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.225
COST WE'RE SPENDING MILLIONS OF

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:48.626
DOLLARS ON SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:50.662
GONNA BE USED WHEN WE COULD.

00:28:50.728 --> 00:28:52.097
REALLY MAKE THE BILL MUCH BETTER.

00:28:52.163 --> 00:28:52.664
AND SPENT IN A MUCH MORE

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.165
EFFECTIVE WAY AND THE LOCALS

00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:55.867
COULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

00:28:55.934 --> 00:28:57.068
INFORMATION.

00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:58.303
IT WILL NOT BE USEFUL TO THEM

00:28:58.369 --> 00:28:59.504
BECAUSE WE KNOW THE KIND OF

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:00.472
INFORMATION THEY NEED WHEN THEY

00:29:00.538 --> 00:29:01.673
PRODUCE THEIR OWN LOCAL

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:03.041
MEDICATION PROGRAMS AND IT'S NOT

00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:04.309
WITH THIS BILL COULD POSSIBLY

00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:04.576
PRODUCE.

00:29:04.642 --> 00:29:05.844
BASED ON THE DATA THEY HAVE WE

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.645
HAVE -- ANY COUNTERPOINTS TO

00:29:07.712 --> 00:29:12.717
THAT -- I AM HAPPY.

00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:14.185
TO PROVIDE A BRIEF RESPONSE BUT

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:15.720
THEN HAVE THE STRUCTURAL

00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:17.922
ENGINEER I GIVE A MUCH MORE IN

00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:19.357
DEPTH RESPONSE -- FIRST JUST

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:22.961
JUST. TO SUMMARIZE IF YOU CAN.

00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:25.430
WILL THE LOCALS FIND THIS A

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:27.265
BENEFIT WILL THIS THE FOLKS AT

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:28.566
THE STATE LEVEL AND ON WITHIN

00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:31.169
THE TWENTY NINE COUNTIES FIND

00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:31.569
THIS OF BENEFITS.

00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:33.471
YES.

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:35.773
THIS WAS KIND OF A COST CUTTING

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.142
MEASURE.

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:38.443
LAST YEAR'S BILL THAT THE

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.478
GOVERNOR VETOED WAS GONNA BE IT

00:29:40.545 --> 00:29:42.547
WAS MORE EXPENSIVE.

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:44.516
AND IT REQUIRED MORE FUNDING --

00:29:44.582 --> 00:29:46.784
AND IT PUT SOME OF THAT BURDEN

00:29:46.851 --> 00:29:48.319
ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:50.855
THIS WAS A WAY OF REDUCING IT TO

00:29:50.922 --> 00:29:52.490
ONLY THE TWENTY NINE MOST

00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:53.391
SEISMICALLY ACTIVE.

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:56.861
COUNTIES -- THAT WILL BENEFIT

00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:58.663
FROM HAVING THIS MEASURE IN

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.332
PLACE AND HAVE AND FOR US TO

00:30:01.399 --> 00:30:03.701
HAVE IN AN ACCURATE COUNT.

00:30:03.768 --> 00:30:07.105
OF WHAT THE MOST VULNERABLE.

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:09.174
AS FAR IN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.708
NEW ADDRESSING LANDED MANDATE

00:30:10.775 --> 00:30:13.444
FROM AN EARLIER VERSION SCALED

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:15.380
BACK.

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:20.285
OKAY THANK YOU.

00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:21.519
THERE ARE TWO LETTER THANK YOU

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:23.621
FOR SHARE I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:25.290
BECAUSE INFORMATION IS POWER.

00:30:25.356 --> 00:30:27.292
IN IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:28.493
THAT I REPRESENT.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.662

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.371
THAT DOOR I SEE THAT.

00:30:40.438 --> 00:30:42.440
BUT AND I HOPE IT LEAVES THE

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:44.609
DOOR TO RETROFITTING OF SOME OF

00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:49.347
THESE BUILDINGS BECAUSE YOU KNOW --

00:30:49.414 --> 00:30:49.981
NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE FOUR THREE

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:51.149

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:55.420
BUILDINGS SO -- DO YOU SEE A

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:56.721
CORRELATION BETWEEN THE STATE

00:30:56.788 --> 00:30:58.690
AND THE COUNTIES AND CITY

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:00.024

WOULD YOU ENVISION FROM THIS.

00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:05.630
IT'S LIKE GOING TO A DOCTOR YOU

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:07.131
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE UNTIL

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:09.734
THE DIET DOCTOR DIAGNOSES WHAT

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:11.069
YOU HAVE EXACTLY.

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:13.805
AND THEN LAYS OUT FOR YOU WHAT

00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:15.306
THE TREATMENT IS GOING TO BE

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:16.574
THIS IS THE SAME THING.

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:18.376
IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT BUILDINGS

00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:20.311
ARE VULNERABLE HOW ARE WE GONNA

00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:22.280
HAVE AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF

00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:24.315
WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:25.883
TO RETROFIT OR FIX.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.652
AND HOW MUCH OF A COST IT'S

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.287

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:35.693
CONTRIBUTION TO HELP LOCAL

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.095
BUSINESSES OUT WOULD BE.

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:39.163
SO INSTEAD OF JUST INTRODUCING

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.100
BUT I'VE ALSO HAD LEGISLATION ON

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:44.936
TAX CREDITS -- SO THAT IT WOULD

00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:46.904
WE WOULD HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE

00:31:46.971 --> 00:31:49.240
TO FUND THE NEEDS THAT ARE GONNA

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:51.776

ON STRENGTHENING BUILDING CODES

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:09.260
AND THEN WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:11.062
WE'RE ASKING FOR TAX CREDITS. TO

ALLOW -- FOR THESE TYPES OF

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:18.136
FIXES THAT ARE NECESSARY.
