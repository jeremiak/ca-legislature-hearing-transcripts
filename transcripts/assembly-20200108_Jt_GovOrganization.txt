THIS MEETING TO ORDER. WELCOME TO THE JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING WITH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION COMMITTEES WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN- WITH MY COMPATRIOTS SENATOR DODD CHAIRMAN DODD WITH HIS OPENING REMARKS. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY. YES THE CHAIRMAN SAID ON SENATOR BILL DODD CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING CHAIRMAN GREATEST STAFF FOR THEIR HELP IN ORGANIZING THIS JOINT HEARING AND WELCOME YOU ALL TO DID TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING. ON SPORTS BETTING. AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE THE SUPREME COURT DECISION OVERTURNED PASS BUT IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED THE SPORTS BETTING LANDSCAPE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. LESS THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THAT DECISION SPORTS BETTING IS NOW LEGAL. IN TWENTY STATES UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THOSE SPORTS BETTING REMAINS ILLEGAL IN OUR STATE THE FACT REMAINS THAT CALIFORNIA'S HAVE IT WILL CONTINUE TO WAGER BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE YEAR ON THEIR FAVORITE SPORT. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF ITS ILLEGALITY ALL OF THIS OCCURRING ON THE BLACK MARKET. CALIFORNIA RECEIVED NO REVENUE NO FUNDS ARE GOING TO OUR SCHOOLS ARE FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS OUR ROADS OR ANY OTHER STATE LOCAL SERVICES. IN ADDITION OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTIVITY OUR LOVE COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED AND HAVE LITTLE RECOURSE WHEN THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. WE ALL KNOW THE SPORTS BETTING WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR AND CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF ITS LEGALITY. THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT WE MUST ANSWER IS WHETHER WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE REGULATED AND TAKE IT OUT OF THE SHADOWS OR IF IT'S YOU CONTINUE TO OPERATE ON THE BLACK MARKET. I FOR ONE BELIEVE THAT WE MUST BRING SPORTS BETTING OUT OF THE SHADOWS IN A MANNER. THAT PROVIDES THE BEST DEAL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDES MAXIMUM PROTECTIONS FOR CONSTITUENTS. I'M HOPEFUL THE TODAY'S HEARING WILL PROVIDE THIS COMMITTEE WITH EXAMPLES OF WHAT IT WHAT HAS AND HASN'T WORKED IN OTHER STATES. AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ENSURE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY WAGERING ILLEGALLY COME TO A REGULATED MARKET. LET ME THANK ALL THOSE WITNESSES IN ADVANCE CHAIRMAN GRAY WHICH I'D SAY A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU. THURMOND AND WELCOME. TO OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS BOTH ASSEMBLY AND SENATE. CERTAINLY TO ALL OF OUR WITNESSES OUR GRATITUDE FOR. HAVING TRAVELED GREAT DISTANCES TO BE HERE WITH US AND PROVIDE YOUR EXPERT TESTIMONY- AND OF COURSE TO THE PUBLIC. FOR THEIR- ROLE TODAY IN THIS HEARING THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT SPORTS WAGERING HAS BECOME A CULTURAL PHENOM IN THE U. S. AND- WITH THE HELP OF FANTASY SPORTS HAS HELPED PROPEL THE NFL TO UNPRECEDENTED RATINGS AND RECORD REVENUE AMONGST. OUR OTHER PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LEAGUES AND SPORTS ECONOMY. FOR ANY SPORTS FAN THE POPULARITY OF SPORTS BETTING IN FANCY SPORTS HAS BEEN HARD TO MISS. IT IS CLEAR THAT WE ARE QUICKLY HEADING IN THE DIRECTION THAT OVER WELL THOUGHT OUT LEGAL SPORTS BETTING FRAMEWORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO CREATE THIS FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT PROVIDE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO GET THIS LONG STANDING EMERGING ACTIVITY. OUT OF THE SHADOWS OF THE LISTENER BLACK MARKET. SINCE THE SUPREME COURT DECISION A MAY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT ENDED NEVADA'S MONOPOLY ON U. S. BASED LEGAL SPORTS WAGERING. SPORTS BETTING LAWS OF PASSED IN TWENTY STATES THAT ARE PENDING IN THIRTEEN. MANY OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING GOING FORWARD. INDUSTRY EXPERTS HAVE STATED BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AS MANY AS FORTY STATES COULD ALLOW SPORTS GAMBLING. IN ADDITION BASED ON POPULATION ROUGHLY 50% OF AMERICANS WHO LIVE IN STATES THAT HAVE SOME FORM OF SPORTS BETTING BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN CALIFORNIA WE MUST REMEMBER THAT WE ARE GOVERNED BY DIFFERENT SET OF GAMING LAWS AND REGULATIONS WE NEED TO CONSIDER A SPORTS WAGERING FRAMEWORK THAT FITS CALIFORNIA AND ITS COMPLEX GAMING LOS. CONSEQUENTLY THIS IS WHY LAST JUNE BOTH CENTER DODD NINE INTRODUCED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS RELATING TO SPORTS WAGERING IN OUR RESPECTIVE HOUSES TO OPEN THE STYLE WALK. TODAY'S AGENDA INCLUDES A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRY EXPERTS TO EDUCATE US ON THE HISTORY LOGISTICS REVENUES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN A REGULATED SPORTS BETTING FRAMEWORK AND SYSTEM. GAMING EXPERT TO STAY THE CALIFORNIA WOULD BE A PREMIUM MARKET FOR SPORTS BETTING GIVEN ITS HE HIGH POPULATION THE ROBUST SPORTS ECONOMY. ERICA GAMING ASSOCIATION ESTIMATES AMERICANS WAGERED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ON SPORTS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BEFORE PASSED WAS OVERTURNED. IT ALSO CLAIMS NEARLY ALL OF THOSE WAGES WERE LEGAL. IF YOU BREAK THOSE LEGAL WAGERS DOWN BY POPULATION THAT WOULD MEAN CALIFORNIA'S APPROXIMATELY THIRTY NINE MILLION RESIDENTS BAT AN ESTIMATED EIGHTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ON SPORTS AND TWENTY SIXTY. WE'VE ALSO SEEN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LEAGUES SUCH AS MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL AND THE NBA PARTNER WAS SPORTS WAGERING OPERATORS TO GROW THEIR RESPECTIVE INDUSTRIES. BY PURE SIZE LONG CALIFORNIA SPORTS WAGERING MARKET IS UNIQUE AND EXTREMELY LARGE. A MODEL ACTION BY ONE STATE RELATED SPORTS WAGERING MIGHT BE INTERESTING CONCEPT BUT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO CONSIDER WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ADDITIONALLY WE KEEP THE HOUSE SPORTS BETTING IS A LOW MARGIN BUSINESS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL CALIFORNIA BY INDUSTRY EXPERTS THE POTENTIAL GRAYSON. GROSS GAMING REVENUES FROM LEGALIZING THE ACTIVITY IS IN THE BILLIONS. A LEGAL MARKET NEEDS TO HAVE STRONG ANSWER PROTECTIONS IN SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT THE WAGES ARE FAIR PROHIBIT UNDERAGE USAGE PREVENT PATHOLOGICAL PLAY AND THE FANS TO ENGAGE IN THE ACTIVITY SHARE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. TO WIN AND TO GET PAID. I'M CONFIDENT THAT THIS BODY CAN CREATE A WHILE REGULARLY GO SPORTS WAGERING SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA ONE THAT GENERATES JOBS AND RETURNS THE GREATEST REVENUE. WHILE PROVIDING SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THE CURRENTLY BET ON SPORTS THROUGH ILLEGAL MEANS. TODAY'S HEARING WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD SHAPING THE FUTURE OF SPORTS BETTING CALIFORNIA HELPING TO BRING THE ACTIVITY AYE ACTIVITY OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND INTO THE LIGHT OF REGULATION. LET'S BEGIN THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION HEARING I WANT TO START BY CALLING UP OUR FIRST PANEL TITLED OVERVIEW OF REGULATE SPORTS BETTING IN UNITED STATES AND WHAT IT COULD MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA SO FAR PANELS WOULD PLEASE APPROACH. DANIEL WALLACH AND CHRIS GROW. WELCOME GENTLEMEN SIT DOWN AND PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN DODD CHAIRMAN GRAY HAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS DANIEL WALLACE AND I AM THE FOUNDER OF WALLET LEGAL LLC LAW FIRM FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE REGULATED SPORTS WAGERING IN GAMBLING INDUSTRIES I AM ALSO THE CO FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE SCHOOL OF LAW'S. SPORTS WAGERING AND INTEGRITY PROGRAM THE NATION'S FIRST LAW SCHOOL CERTIFICATE PROGRAM DEDICATED TO THE STUDY OF SPORTS WAGERING IN REGULATION ONE OF THE CLASSES THAT I TEACH- FOCUSES ON STATE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS ON GAMBLING EXPANSION. AN APPROPRIATE SUBJECT FOR TODAY. SINCE THE DEMISE OF PASS BUT- NINETEEN STATES PLUS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE JOINED NEVADA IN ALLOWING SPORTS WAGERING TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN STATE BORDERS. WITH A FEW NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS THESE SO CALLED FIRST WAVE STATES HAVE AUTHORIZED SPORTS BETTING THE OLD FASHION WAY. GROUP BILLS PASSED BY STATE LEGISLATURES AND SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNORS OF THOSE STATES BUT AS WE MOVE INTO TWENTY TWENTY THE NEXT WAVE OF STATES LIKE THAT CONSIDER AUTHORIZING SPORTS WAGERING MAY NEED TO TAKE A DECIDEDLY DIFFERENT APPROACH. WHICH IS AMENDMENTS TO STATE CONSTITUTIONS ACCOMPLISHED BY WAY OF A VOTER REFERENDUM AMONG THE STATES THAT ARE CONSIDERING A BALLOT MEASURE TO LEGALIZE SPORTS BETTING OR CALIFORNIA TEXAS GEORGIA LOUISIANA MARYLAND NEBRASKA SOUTH CAROLINA AND SOUTH DAKOTA. THE REASON WHY THE STATE'S MAY NEED TO PURSUE LEGALIZATION TO A VOTER REFERENDUM IS BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE IN THEIR STATE CONSTITUTIONS WHICH EXPRESSLY PROHIBIT CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF GAMBLING SUCH AS LOTTERIES OR CASINOS OR IN SOME CASES ALL FORMS OF GAMBLING. LEGISLATIVE OFFICIALS CANNOT PASS NEW STATUTES WHICH CONFLICT WITH STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS THUS IN ORDER TO LEGALIZE A NEW CATEGORY OF GAMBLING SUCH AS SPORTS BETTING. IN STATES THAT HAVE BROAD CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON GAMBLING A STATE MAY NEED TO AMEND ITS CONSTITUTION SO AS TO AUTHORIZE SPORTS BETTING AS AN EXCEPTION TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL BAN WHICH BRINGS ME TO CALIFORNIA. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION REQUIRES A BALLOT QUESTION FOR SPORTS BETTING I HAVE STUDIED THIS ISSUE VERY CLOSELY I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY FINDINGS WITH COMMITTEE. THE HE ANTI GAMBLING CAN IN THE- CONSTITUTION IS ARTICLE FOUR SECTION NINETEEN HE WHICH DECLARES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS NO POWER TO AUTHORIZE. AND SHALL PROHIBIT CASINO BECAUSE OF THE TYPE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN NEVADA AND NEW JERSEY WHAT IS THIS PROVISION ME SOME HAVE INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT UP IT FOR CLOSES THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORIZATION TO SPORTS BETTING SINCE SPORTS BETTING FORM OF GAMBLING THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN BOTH. NEVADA AND NEW JERSEY BUT THE NEW TINO'S AN INSPECTION NINETEEN E. ACCOUNT. SITUATION ONLY APPLY. IS TO BUILDINGS NOT CATEGORIES OF GAMBLING AND CERTAINLY NOT THE CATEGORIES OF GAMBLING THAT WEREN'T EVEN IN EXISTENCE IN BOTH NEVADA AND NEW JERSEY WHEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WAS APPROVED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. HOW DO WE KNOW THIS THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS SAID SO IN A NINETEEN NINETY NINE DECISION CALLED HOTEL EMPLOYEES AND RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION VERSUS STATUS I HAVE A COPY IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HELD THAT SUBSECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY APPLIES ONLY TO CASINO BUILDINGS OR FACILITIES THAT CONTAIN THE TYPES OF GAMBLING ACTIVITIES THAT WERE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH CASINOS IN NEVADA AND NEW JERSEY AS OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR- THE YEAR THAT THE AMENDMENT WAS APPROVED AS AN ADDITION TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THIS OF COURSE WOULD EXCLUDE SPORTS BETTING FROM THE REACH OF SUBSECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY FOR ONE BASIC REASON IT WASN'T EVEN LEGAL IN NEW JERSEY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED THE AMENDMENT TO THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION IN FACT WOULD BE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR YEARS. BEFORE NEW JERSEY CASINOS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LEGALLY OFFER SPORTS BETTING THUS THE ANTI CASINO BAND IN SECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION DOES NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF THIS LET'S. AUTHORIZING SPORTS BETTING THROUGH A NEW STATUTORY REGIME NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION- THE ONLY OTHER ONE THAT POTENTIALLY STANDS AS A BARRIER. TO THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORIZATION OF SPORTS BETTING IS SECTION NINETEEN F. OF ARTICLE FOR WHICH AUTHORIZES THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA TO NEGOTIATE AND CONCLUDE COMPAQ'S. SUBJECT TO RATIFICATION BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA'S INDIAN TRIBES TO OPERATE SLOT MACHINES LOTTERY GAMES AND BANKING IN PERCENTAGE CARD GAMES ON TRIBAL LANDS. BUT THAT'S JUST A SIMPLE AUTHORIZATION MEASURE AND IT ONLY APPLIES TO A SPECIFIC SUB CLASS OF GAMBLING WHICH ARE SLOT MACHINES LOTTERY GAMES AND BANKING AND PERCENTAGE CARD GAMES IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT OR PREVENT THIS LEGISLATURE FROM PASSING A SPORTS BETTING LAW. THERE IS SIMPLY NO CONSTITUTIONAL IMPEDIMENT TO THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORIZATION OF SPORTS BETTING AND I RAISE THIS SIMPLY AS A REMINDER THAT THE VOTER REFERENDUM PROCESS IS OFTEN FRAUGHT WITH PERIL AND UNCERTAINTY YOUR ESSENTIALLY SUBJECTING THE LEGISLATION. TO TWO VOTES- FIRST YOU'RE GONNA NEED A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE JUST TO GET IT ON THE BALLOT. AND THEN THE PUBLIC HAS TO APPROVE IT. AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS GO THE WAY YOU WOULD EXPECT- THE RECENT VOTER REFERENDA IN COLORADO AND NEW HAMPSHIRE- BEAR THIS OUT IN NOVEMBER COLORADO RESIDENTS WENT TO THE POLLS TO VOTE ON A SPORTS BETTING BALLOT MEASURE. EXPECTED TO BE APPROVED BY THE BY A WIDE MARGIN THE COLORADO SPORTS BETTING MEASURE KNOWN AS PROPOSITION DE DE. PASSED BY A SLIM 512409% MARGIN WITH THE FIFTY THOUSAND VOTES OUT OF MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE IN CASH STE SEPARATING THE YES VOTE IN THE NOTE. AND THIS WAS A SURPRISINGLY CLOSE CALL FOR A MEASURE THAT IT BEEN POLLING COMFORTABLY IN THE 60% APPROVAL RANGE AND WHICH ENJOYED THE BACKING OF ALL KEY STAKEHOLDERS. SO WELL NOT WHAT COLORADO NARROWLY PASSED AT SPORTS BETTING MEASURE. CITIES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE DID NOT NEW HAMPSHIRE IN JULY ENACTED A SPORTS BETTING ALL THAT AUTHORIZES UP TO FIVE MOBILE PLATFORMS AND SPAIN BT SPORT BOOK LOCATIONS BUT LOOKED IT UP TO THE BORDERS OF THE CITY TO DECIDE WHETHER TO ALLOW RETAIL SPORTS BOOK IMPAIR MUNICIPALITY. AND DESPITE NO KNOWN OPPOSITION THE REFERENDUM FAILED IN FOUR OUT OF NINE CITIES. SO AT THE THRESHOLD MATTER. YOU MAY WISH TO READ TO ASK WHETHER THE BEST PATH FOR LEGALIZING SPORTS BETTING CALIFORNIA IS A STATE WIDE VOTER REFERENDUM. OR BY A PURELY STATUTORY ENACTMENT. THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT STAND IN THE WAY. REGARDLESS OF WHICH PATH YOU TAKE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CRITICAL DECISIONS THAT YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE. ON WHAT KIND OF LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE BEST SUITED FOR CALIFORNIA. FAR AND AWAY. THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION THAT YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE IS WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT MOBILE SPORTS WAGERING WILL BE PERMITTED OF THE TWENTY ONE JURISDICTIONS THAT OF. ONLINE INTERNET SPORTS BETTING. I'M SORRY- YOU KNOW ON YOUR SMARTPHONE ON ON THE INTERNET ON YOUR COMPUTER OF THE TWENTY ONE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE LEGALIZED SPORTS BETTING FIFTEEN OF THEM ALLOW MOBILE WAGERING. SO WHY IS MOBILE SO IMPORTANT WELL FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE GONE ONLINE IN THE LAST DECADE TO ORDER DINNER BOOK A PLANE TICKET BY THEATER TICKETS OR CHECK OUR BANK ACCOUNT IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF SPORTS BETS ARE MADE REMOTELY. FROM THE CONVENIENCE OF A SMARTPHONE OR áP IN NEW JERSEY AND PENNSYLVANIA MOBILE SPORTS BETTING ALREADY ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN 80% OF ALL LEGAL BETSY MADE IN THOSE STATES. AND THOSE NUMBERS ARE INCREASING MONTH BY MONTH AS THE MARKET MATURES. AND CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE GEOGRAPHY WITH NEARLY FORTY MILLION PEOPLE SPREAD OUT OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. DEMANDS IN INTEGRATED INCONVENIENT APPROACH TO SPORTS BETTING WITH THE EMPHASIS ON THE WORD CONVENIENT I MEAN THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF TERRAIN. FOR RETAIL ONLY MARKET TO BE ABLE TO COVER. IF CALIFORNIA HOPES TO MAKE A DENT IN THE ELITE SPORTS BETTING MARKET AND BRING IN SIGNIFICANT REVENUE. BENEFIT THEIR GREAT STATE AND TO FUND CRITICAL PUBLIC INITIATIVES MOBILE AND ONLINE SPORTS WAGERING MUST BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. SMART BED IT WAS SMART SPORTS BETTING REGULATION WILL ENSURE MOBILE AND ONLINE PLOT. FORMS FOR CUSTOMERS OTHERWISE THE ILLEGAL MARKET WILL REMAIN NEARLY A STRONG AND ROBUST AS IT IS TODAY AND THE STATE WILL ONLY REALIZE A SMALL FRACTION OF THE POTENTIAL REVENUES. FURTHER THE LACK OF A MOBILE SPORTS BETTING ENVIRONMENT WILL INEVITABLY LEAD CONSUMERS TO PLACE THEIR BETS IN NEIGHBORING STATES. CALIFORNIA IS BORDERED BY TWO STATES THAT ALREADY HAVE MOBILE SPORTS BETTING NEVADA. AND OREGON. IT WILL BE MUCH EASIER AND FAR MORE CONVENIENT FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS LIVING ALONG THE BORDER TO DRIVE TO KNOW ABOUT AN ORGAN IN PLACE THEIR BETS WITH SMARTPHONES AND THEN DRIVE BACK INTO CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN NEW YORK STATE WE'RE SPORTS BETTING IS LEGAL ONLY A BRICK AND MORTAR CASINOS LOCATED HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. FROM NEW YORK CITY SO WHERE DO YOU THINK NEW YORK CITY RESIDENTS ARE BETTING THE GETTING IN THE CARS DRIVING ACROSS THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE GOING THROUGH THE LINCOLN HOLLAND TUNNEL AND TAKING THE PATH TRAIN TO HOBOKEN. JUST TO PLACE A SPORTS BET BECAUSE IT'S MORE CONVENIENT. AND HERE'S ANOTHER ESSENTIAL BENEFIT TO HAVING MOBILE SPORTS WAGERING ONLINE PLATFORMS IN THE INSTANT DATA THAT THEY PROVIDE ARE THE ONLY WAY. TO ENSURE TIGHT REAL TIME INTEGRITY MONITORING OF BETS AND BETTING PATTERNS TO ENSURE THAT ANY SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR IS IMMEDIATELY NOTICED AND FORWARDED IT PROVIDES A REAL TIME DIGITAL FINGERPRINT THAT ALLOWS FOR MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE MONITORING IN AS A STATE POLICYMAKERS. IF YOU'VE DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE PILLARS OF REGULATION THE PROTECTION OF THE INTEGRITY OF SPORTING EVENTS WILL MOBILE SPORTS BETTING IN MOBILE WAGERING IS THE WAY TO PROTECT. US PROTECT SPORTS AND WAGERING INTEGRITY- SO TO CREATE A SUCCESSFUL STATEWIDE BETTING MARKET AND PUT A STOP TO THE ILLEGAL BLACK MARKET AND TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF TAX DOLLARS TO NEIGHBORING STATES. BIGELOW EYES SPORTS BETTING IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE READILY ACCESSIBLE AND REFLECT TODAY'S HEAVY CONSUMER INTERNET USAGE WITH FULL MOBILE AND ONLINE AT. ACCESS THESE ARE OBVIOUS AND SELF EVIDENT POINTS ALONG THE SAME LINES YOU ALSO HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THE BEST POSSIBLE RETAIL MARKETING CALIFORNIA THOUGH THAT THAT'S BRICK AND MORTAR LAND BASED SPORTS BETTING IT'S NOT ONLY JUST ABOUT MOBILE. TRIBAL CASINOS AND HORSE RACE TRACKS OR WONDERFUL START BUT THEY'RE JUST A START IT'S NOT THE SUM AND SUBSTANCE OF RETAIL SPORTS BETTING I'D LIKE TO POINT TO ANOTHER LEGISLATIVE TREND THAT HAS EMERGED. IN A NUMBER OF STATES THAT I SEE DEVELOPING WHICH IS BRINGING SPORTS BETTING TO THE VENUES WHICH ACTUALLY HOST THE SORTING EVENTS. YOU KNOW OF A JURY OF DO A RADICAL PROPOSITION BUT ILLINOIS IN DC HAVE ALREADY PASSED LAWS THAT ALLOW IN STADIUM BATTING. AND NEW YORK IN KENTUCKY HAVE PROPOSED SIMILAR MAPPERS CALIFORNIA HAS NINETEEN PROFESSIONALS TEAMS MORE THAN TWICE THE AMOUNT OF ANY OTHER STATE AND MOST OF THOSE TEAMS PLAY IN STADIUMS AND ARENAS. LOCATED A MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS LIKE LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO ANAHEIM SAN JOSE OAKLAND SAN DIEGO AND YES EVEN% SACRAMENTO. MILLIONS OF FANS PASS THROUGH THE TURN STYLES OF CALIFORNIA SPORTS VENUES EVERY YEAR. YOU KNOW HOW LONG OF A DISTANCE IT IS FROM UP MAJOR MAJOR LOS ANGELES DIDN'T TO THE NEAREST TRIBAL CASINO. WELL IT'S MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILES IF YOU LIVE IN LA. YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE INCLINED TO DRIVE TO A TRIBAL CASINO JUST PLACE A SPORTS BET- BUT IF IT'S AT THE STAPLES CENTER OF THE FORUM. OR ANY OF THE MAJOR DOWNTOWN SPORTS ARENAS YOU'VE CAPTURED A READY MADE AUDIENCE OF SPORTS BETTORS THOSE WHO ACTUALLY WATCHING CONSUME THE PRODUCT AND HAVE ENTHUSIASM FOR IT- SO WOULD IT MAKE SENSE TO INCLUDE THESE MAJOR VENUES IN THE EQUATION FOR SPORTS BETTING. AND TO CAPTURE THIS READY MADE AUDIENCE I MEAN THERE ARE NUMBER OF COMPELLING REASONS TO DO SO SPORTS BET SPORTS FANS OF THE OBVIOUS TARGETS FOR SPORTS BETTING. THEY'RE ALREADY CONSUMING A PRODUCT THEY'RE ALREADY IN THE BUILDING THESE ARENAS OR MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS WHERE'S MY OF THE LAND BASE. CASINOS ARE NOT- STADIUMS ARENAS OBVIOUSLY HAVE MORE CUSTOMERS AND SEATING CAPACITY- YOU KNOW THEN CASINO BASED SPORTS BOOKS LARGEST CASINO BASED SPORTS BOOK AND MAYBE FIT. COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE SPORTS BOOK ARENAS BY CONTRAST HAVE THOUSANDS OF PAYING CUSTOMERS. SO IF ONE OF THE GOALS OF STATE AUTHORIZED SPORTS BETTING IS TO MAXIMIZE REVENUES FOR THE STATE. THEN IT STANDS TO REASON THAT PLACE AND SUPPORT BOOK IN THE LARGEST VENUES WOULD BE THE OBVIOUS WAY TO GO. AND ONE SURE FIRE WAY OF MEETING AND EVEN EXCEEDING REVENUE PROJECTIONS WOULD BE TO INCLUDE WITHIN THE PERMITTED CLASS OF BETTING OPERATORS THOSE VENUES AND FACILITIES THAT TRACKED THE LARGEST NUMBER OF POTENTIAL SPORTS WAGERING CUSTOMERS. WHO ARE YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE THAT IS THE MULTI THOUSAND SEEK PROFESSIONAL SPORTS BILL- VENUES THAT TRUCK TENS OF MILLIONS OF âRTS ANNUALLY- SO IN CLOSING I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR HERE TODAY. AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVES AND INSIGHTS. THANK YOU SIR MR GROWTH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR GRAY CHAIR DODD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRIS GROVE I'M A PARTNER TO FIRM CALLED EILERS INCREASE CHECK GAMING I WAS A GREAT CHECK IS A CALIFORNIA BASED RESEARCH AND CONSULTING FIRM FOCUSED ON THE GLOBAL GAMBLING INDUSTRY AND I HAD OF OUR SPORTS BETTING PRACTICE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME COLOR IN CONTEXT AROUND THE MARKET PERFORMANCE AND POTENTIAL OF LEGAL SPORTS BETTING AND TO PROVIDE THAT PERSPECTIVE I'M GOING TO START THE DISCUSSION BY TALKING ABOUT HOW LEGAL SPORTS BETTING IS PERFORMING TODAY IN THE U. S. ITS POTENTIAL IN THE US AND CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY. OR SOME OF THE CORE POLICY LEVERS DRAMATICALLY IMPACT THE PERFORMANCE OF LEGAL SPORTS BETTING MARKET PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOW CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND MEETING THOSE PREFERENCES CAN ALSO IMPACT THE PERFORMANCE OF LEGAL SPORTS BETTING MARKET DETOUR BRIEFLY INTO SOME RELEVANT LESSONS THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM EUROPEAN MARKETS BEFORE FINALLY WRAPPING UP WITH SOME CONVERSATION AROUND THE ILLEGAL MARKET AND OTHER REGULATED PRODUCT CAN. OR CAN FAIL TO CAPTURE THAT DEMAND. STARTING FIRST WITH MARKET POTENTIAL. IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE ESTIMATE THAT LEGAL SPORTS BETTING WILL GENERATE JUST UNDER A BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL TOP LINE REVENUE ACROSS THE U. S. WE SEE THAT NUMBER GROWING STEADILY TO JUST UNDER SIX BILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. OF NOTE BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE DO EXPECT THAT ROUGHLY THIRTY SIX STATES WILL OF AUTHORIZED SOME FORM OF LEGAL SPORTS BETTING. AND THAT IT WILL AS CHAIR GRAY MENTIONED HAVE EXCEEDED ITS REACH TO OVER POINT. IN TERMS OF THE CALIFORNIA MARKET OUTLOOK WE USE ROUND NUMBERS HERE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO PROVIDE A SPECIFIC NUMBER AND SUGGEST A GREATER SENSE OF CERTAINTY THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE. THESE ARE OF COURSE SIMPLY EDUCATED GUESSES. ARE EDUCATED GUESS IS THAT CALIFORNIA AT BASELINE MATURITY WOULD BE A LEGAL SPORTS BETTING MARKET WORTH ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN TERMS OF TOP LINE REVENUE AND THAT AS SOON AS BOTH RETAIL. AND ONLINE SPORTS BETTING. ROUGHLY 85% OF THAT TOTAL WOULD BE EXPECTED TO COME FROM THE ONLINE SPORTS BETTING CHANNEL. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF AN ONLINE SPORTS BETTING CHANNEL WE ESTIMATE AGAIN TAT ROUGHLY RETAIL ONLY SPORTS BETTING IN CALIFORNIA WOULD GENERATE ABOUT HALF A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ANNUALLY IN REVENUE. SOME OF THE KEY FACTORS THAT CAN DRIVE MARKET PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF THE POLICY LEVERS THAT YOU ALL HAVE ACCESS TO DETERMINE HETHER TO THROTTLE BACK OR THROTTLE UP. THE PERFORMANCE OF LEGAL SPORTS BETTING MARKET. THE FIRST THING I WANT TO NOTE HERE IS THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF STATES TODAY THAT HAVE ENACTED LEGAL SPORTS BETTING IS HIGHLY VARIABLE YOU CAN SEE A STATE LIKE NEW JERSEY IS PERFORMING AT SOME THREE TO FOUR TIMES. THE RATE THAT A STATE LIKE MISSISSIPPI IS PERFORMING AT IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF HANDLED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF BETS THAT ARE BEING PLACED BY ADULTS IF WE LOOK TO RECENT MONTHS. SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT SEPARATE THE STATE'S AND HOW DO THEY IMPACT THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS LEGAL SPORTS BETTING MARKETS. WE'LL START FIRST WITH THE QUESTION OF SPORTS BETTING DISTRIBUTION AS DâN POINTED OUT ONLINE SPORTS BETTING IS CURRENTLY LEGAL IN ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE STATES THAT HAVE AUTHORIZED SPORTS BETTING SO FAR. AND IN THOSE STATES ONLINE SPORTS BETTING TENDS TO ACCOUNT FOR ROUGHLY 80% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN NEW JERSEY IT'S ABOUT 8182% WE DO EXPECT AS A SIDE NOTE THAT THAT NUMBER WILL STEADILY INCREASE OVER TIME. HE WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF WE WERE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION FIVE YEARS FROM NOW IF THAT NUMBER WAS CLOSER TO NINETY. 14% FOR TO MARKET. BECAUSE THAT'S THE GENERAL TRAJECTORY OF CONSUMER PREFERENCE IS AGAIN MORE AND MORE THINGS THROUGH THE ONLINE CHANNEL. I WILL THAT IN THE STATES THAT HAVE AUTHOR I SAW THANKS FOR BEING MIRED IN ORDER FOR YOU TO COMPLETE TO SIGN UP FOR YOUR ONLINE SPORTS BETTING ACCOUNT. THE YOU ACTUALLY VISIT RETAIL LICENSE GAMBLING LOCATION IN ORDER TO COMPLETE HAT ACCOUNT CREATION ILLINOIS IS TAKING A SIMILAR APPROACH MY HOME STATE OF NEVADA HAS ACTUALLY HAVE. PRO TEMPLATE FOR NEARLY A DECADE NOW. I WILL KNOW THAT AMONG COMMERCIAL CASINOS SUPPORT FOR ONLINE SPORTS BETTING IS RELATIVELY A CONSENSUS POSITION WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT INDIAN COUNTRY INTRACTABLE CASINOS IT'S A FAR MORE COMPLEX ISSUE. AND THERE'S FAR LESS THE CONSENSUS IN IN IN COUNTRY REGARDING RELATIVE MERITS OF ONLINE SPORTS BETTING. AND YOU CAN LOOK TO PENNSYLVANIA AS AN EXAMPLE OF A HIGH TAX STATE THIRTY SIX PERCENT. OF GIGI ARE SO SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO CONSENSUS AMONG STATES WHEN IT COMESTO WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE TAX RATE. FOR REGULATED SPORTS BETTING. I WILL KNOW TO FEW THINGS STATES WITH BIG TICKET TAX RATES HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN THE EXCEPTION AND NOT THE RULE SO IF YOU LOOK. TO THE MIDDLE WERE STATES ARE LANDING ON THIS QUESTION THEY ARE LANDING ON TAX RATES THAT TEND TO DRIFT BELOW TWENTY PERCENT. THERE IS SOME AVAILABLE RESEARCH ON THIS QUESTION FROM INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND IT DOES SUGGEST THAT 20% IS RIGHT AROUND THE THRESHOLD WHERE AS YOU MOVE TAX RATES ABOVE THAT THRESHOLD. YOUR ABILITY TO CAPTURE DEMAND FROM THE ILLEGAL MARKET WHICH DOES NOT SUFFER UNDERNEATH THE SAME SORT OF TAX BURDEN. DROPS OFF DISPROPORTIONATELY AND I FURTHER NOTE FOR MEMBERS THAT THE STATE TAX RATE IS NOT THE ONLY TOP LINE TAX BURDEN AT OPERATORS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. COMMERCIAL SPORTS BETTING OPERATORS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A FEDERAL TAX IT'S CALLED THE- EXCISE WAGERING TAX. AND THAT IS POINT 25% ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT BET OR HANDLE ROUGHLY SPEAKING THAT TRANSLATES INTO ABOUT A 5% TAX. ON REVENUE SO OPERATORS AREN'T STARTING AT 0% TAX AND THEN STATE TAX COMES INTO PLAY. COMMERCIAL OPERATORS ARE STARTING AT ROUGHLY A 5% TAX THANKS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN ANY TAX THAT THE STATE ADD ON TOP OF THAT. IS OBVIOUSLY ADDITIVE. I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING AND AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT THE RESEARCH THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE SUBJECT BUT THE HIGHER THE TAX RATE GENERALLY SPEAKING. THE LOWER YOUR RATE OF A LEGAL MARKET CAPTURE. BECAUSE YOU AS YOU INCREASED TAX RATES YOU DECREASE THE ABILITY OF OPERATORS TO DO THINGS LIKE PRICE ODDS IN A WAY THAT COMPETITIVE THE ELITE. MARKET AND ALL PROMOTE. TWENTY MILLION THAT DOES REQUIRE LITTLE CRACKING OF THE NECK WHEN YOU SAY THAT NUMBER A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR LICENSE FEE FOR AN ONLINE ONLY SPORTS BETTING LICENSE. IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE WHY POLICYMAKERS AND SOME STATES ARE TAKING THAT APPROACH BECAUSE LICENSE FEES DO PROVIDE FOR SOME STATES. A USEFUL ONE TIME INJECTION OF FUNDS INTO THE BUDGET. I WILL NOTE THAT LICENSE FEES ESPECIALLY AT THAT LEVEL ESSENTIALLY SERVE AS A NOTHER FORM OF TAXATION. AND A NOTHER ASPECT THAT IS GOING TO PULL RESOURCES AWAY FROM PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. FROM THE ABILITY OF OPERATORS TO OFFER COMPETITIVE ODDS WITH THE ILLEGAL MARKET FROM THE ABILITY OF OPERATORS TO PUT MONEY INTO MARKETING. AND TO DRAW DEMAND AND RAISE AWARENESS AWAY FROM THE ILLEGAL MARKET AND AGAIN TO OFFER THE KINDS OF BONUSES AND PROMOTIONS THE YOU MIGHT FIND IT OFFSHORE BETTING SITES. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCOMMODATE SPORTS LEAGUES IS A NOTHER ISSUE WERE STATES HAVE BEEN SPLIT- THE LEAGUE'S DO CONTINUE TO LOBBY AGGRESSIVELY ACROSS THE UNITED STATES PER SEAT AT THE TABLE. IN TERMS OF REGULATED SPORTS BETTING THERE ARE FEW ASKS AND THE LEAGUES ARE CERTAINLY NOT HOMOGENEOUS IN THEIR APPROACH AND I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR. A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES FROM THE LEAKS TODAY THE PRIMARY FOCUS THAT I'VE PERSONALLY SEEN IN MY WORK AT VARIOUS STATE CAPITALS. APPEARS TO BE AROUND THE CONCEPT OF ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO MANDATE THAT LEGAL SPORTS BETTING OPERATORS MUST USE LEAGUE APPROVED DATA IN ORDER TO MAKE AND TO SETTLE BETS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME OTHER AREAS OF INTEREST FOR THE LEAGUE SUCH AS CONTROL OVER WHAT KIND OF BAD SCANNING CAM PLACED. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF STATES INCLUDING ILLINOIS IN TENNESSEE THAT HAVE ENACTED A REQUIREMENT. THAT REGULATED OPERATORS USE OFFICIAL DATA THE ONLY NOTE I WOULD MAKE HERE IS THAT SUCH MANDATES DO AGAIN. AT AN ADDITIONAL COST TO REGULATED OPERATIONS AND WITH EACH ADDITIONAL COST. YOU DO SEE SOMETHING TAKEN AWAY FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCALE IN TERMS OF THESE OPERATORS BEING ABLE TO BE- MAXIMALLY COMPETITIVE WITH THE ILLEGAL PRODUCT. ANOTHER POLICY- WORTH DISCUSSING IS A QUESTION OF MARKET ACCESS WHO CAN APPLY FOR INSTANCE HOW MANY UNIQUE BRANDS CAN BE OPERATED UNDERNEATH EACH INDIVIDUAL LICENSE. IF YOU TAKE A STATE LIKE NEW JERSEY THE MOST EXPANSIVE APPROACH TO THIS QUESTION SO FAR. THEY LIMITED THEIR KEY LICENSES TO THE STATE'S EXISTING CASINOS AND RACE TRACKS. AND THEN THEY SAID EACH OF THOSE KEY LICENSES CAN OPERATE UP TO THREE DISTINCT BRANDS. UNDER EACH ONE OF THOSE LICENSES THERE THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT A FOURTEENTH LICENSE THAT'S HOW WE GET TO FORTY TWO- MY MATH IS NOT QUITE THAT BAD. THIRTEEN TIMES THREE THIRTY NINE. WE GET AN EXTRA THREE BECAUSE OF AN INACTIVE- LICENSE IN NEW JERSEY. THE QUESTION OF MARKET ACCESS AGAIN HAS SOME IMPLICATIONS AROUND HOW COMPETITIVE YOUR MARKET IS GOING TO BE. THEY ALSO HAS SOME IMPLICATIONS THAT ARE QUITE AS OBVIOUS AS SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF A KEY LICENSE IS. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT A SMALLER WHETHER BE TRIBAL WAR COMMERCIAL OPERATOR OR RACE TRACK WE'VE SEEN IN STATES LIKE NEW JERSEY THAT SMALLER OPERATORS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEVERAGE THEIR MARKET ACCESS. AS A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC ASSET SO SMALLER CASINO CAN SAY TO A COMPANY LIKE DRAFTKINGS OUR FANDUEL I'M GOING TO BASICALLY ALLOW YOU TO COME IN UNDER MY LICENSE. AND IN EXCHANGE I'M GOING TO CHARGE YOU AN UP FRONT FEE AND SOME ERCENTAGE OF THE REVENUE THAT YOU GENERATE UNDER THAT LICENSE. SO MARKET ACCESS AS MARKET ACCESS QUESTIONS NOT ONLY IMPACT THE OVERALL SHAPING CONTOURING COMPETITIVENESS OF THE MARKETS BUT THEY ALSO PROVIDE ANOTHER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR KEY LICENSE HOLDERS. SO SOME QUICK TAKEAWAYS HERE MOST STATES ARE CHARTING THEIR OWN COURSE ON SPORTS BETTING THERE IS NO TEMPLATE THERE IS NO PLAYBOOK. THE STAKEHOLDERS IN A LOCAL MARKET OFTEN HAVE DISTINCT AGENDAS THAT DRIVE POLICY IN ONE DIRECTION AND THAT DIRECTION MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE- IN PARALLEL WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE IN THE MOST ROBUST MARKET. WE HAVE ASO PROVIDED A FULL SPREAD SHEET WITH A BREAK DOWN OF THE APPROACHES TO THESE AND OTHER POLICY QUESTIONS BY EVERY JURISDICTION IN U. S. THAT HAS REGULATE SPORTS BETTING SO FAR. THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN MADE AVAILABLE TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND IF NOT CERTAINLY FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME AFTER THE HEARING I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT. BRIEFLY ON THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE SURVEYED THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN SPORTS BETTORS BOTH ACTIVE AND POTENTIAL ON THESE QUESTIONS VERY STATES VARIOUS SURVEYS. RESOUNDINGLY THESE ARE THE ISSUES THAT CONSUMERS TELL US ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM IN TERMS OF LEGAL SPORTS BETTING. THEY WANT FIRST GOOD ODDS AND PRICING. THEY WANT SECOND EASY ACCESS TO THEIR FUNDS THEY WANT THIRD THE ABILITY TO ACCESS SPORTS BETTING VIA MOBILE BANKING APPS. FORTH THE GREATEST VARIETY OF WAYS TO BET NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF. TYPES OF BETS BUT THE AMOUNT OF MARKETS TO BET ON. OF THE VERY TURNED WITH THE OVERALL FAIRNESS LIKE REGULATION THEY LIKE LEGALIZATION THEY LIKE THE ASSURANCES THAT THAT PROVIDES. AND FINALLY THEY ARE OF COURSE- BEING GAMBLERS INTERESTED IN GENEROUS PROMOTIONS AND BONUSES. BRIEFLY SOME LESSONS FROM EUROPE AND AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS ANY OF THESE TOPICS AT LENGTH WITH ANY OF THE MEMBERS OUTSIDE OF THE CONTEXT OF THIS HEARING. WE COMPARED THREE MARKETS FRANCE DENMARK IN THE UNITED KINGDOM DENMARK IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE OFTEN UTILIZED AS COMPARISON MARKETS FOR APPRECIATING HOW A U. S. MARKET MY PERFORMED BECAUSE THE RELATIVELY SIMILAR. CULTURALLY IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND SO ON WE CONTRAST THOSE TWO MARKETS WITH FRANCE AS YOU CAN SEE FRANCE HAS A TAX RATE OF FIFTY PERCENT. COMPARED WITH TAX RATES OF 20% IN DENMARK AND U. K. ALSO SOME RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BE BET ON. AND SOME REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF THE MINIMUM HOLD AS THE CHARTS ON THE SUBSEQUENT SLIDE SHOW FRANCES DRAMATICALLY UNDER PERFORMING U. K. IN DENMARK IN TERMS OF THE TOTAL SPORTS BETTING REVENUE PER CAPITA. ALSO DRAMATICALLY UNDER PERFORMING THOSE TWO MARKETS IN TERMS OF THE PENETRATION RATE SO HOW MANY CONSUMERS IN THE MARKET ARE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN LEGAL SPORTS BETTING. AND FINALLY A DRAMATICALLY UNDER PERFORMING THOSE TWO MARKETS IN TERMS OF THE SPEND PER ACT PLAYER SO NOT ONLY FEWER ACTIVE PLAYERS BUT THOSE WHO ACTUALLY ARE ACTIVE ARE STILL SPENDING LESS ON AVERAGE. THE LESSONS THAT WE TAKE AWAY FROM EUROPE BRIEFLY HI TAX RATES. ABSOLUTELY APPEAR LIMIT GROWTH PLACING BARRIERS TO MARKET ENTRY ALSO ACTS AS A LIMITER ON GROUP BOTH. DIRECTIONS ON THE CONNIE. IN THAT CAN. OFTEN BE THE TYPES. OR WHAT EVENT YOU CAN BET ON HAS THAT SIMILAR RESTRICTIVE IMPACT ON GROWTH. CONSUMERS GENERALLY RESPOND WELL TO CHOICE AND CONTROL AND A CAUTIONARY TALE IT'S EMERGING FROM EUROPE DISTINCT FROM OUR ANALYSIS OF FRANCE DENMARK AND U. K. IS THAT SOME CONTROLS SOME PROACTIVE CONTROLS AROUND MARKETING. SET FORTH IN ADVANCE BY THE LEGISLATURE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND A MORE PRODUCTIVE REGULATED SPORTS BETTING MARKET. FINALLY I WANT TO CLOSE WITH A FEW COMMENTS ON THE ILLEGAL SPORTS BETTING MARKET. CURRENTLY WE ESTIMATE THAT THE REVENUE VALUE FOR ILLEGAL SPORTS BETTING IN THE U. S. IS ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN HERE WE DO NOT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE BETS BETWEEN FRIENDS OR OFFICE POOLS WHICH HELPS TO EXPLAIN THE DISPARITY BETWEEN OUR ESTIMATES AND SOME OTHER ESTIMATES THAT YOU MIGHT SEE. WE COUNT ABOUT FOURTEEN MILLION AMERICANS WHO ARE ANNUALLY BETTING ON OFFSHORE SITES ARE ACTIVELY WITH A BOOKIE AND WE KNOW THAT THE TYPICAL HOLD RATE FOR AN ILLEGAL SPORTS BOOK IS ABOUT FIVE PERCENT. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TAX THE **** WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF LICENSE FEES ENOUGH THE RESTRICTIONS THOSE ALMOST NECESSARILY PUT THE HOLD RATE UP FOR THE LEGAL PRODUCT TO COMPENSATE FOR THE INCREASED COST THEY HAVE THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL CAN. SEND THAT CONSUMERS CAN VERY EASILY MAKE BETWEEN ILLEGAL BETS AND LEGAL THAT'S THE PRICE IS RIGHT THERE ON THE ACT PRICE COMPARISON IS EASY IN SPORTS BETTING AND AS A RESULT PRICE CITY IS A VERY REAL. THING FOR CONSUMERS. IT WAS IN COMMENTS ABOUT THE CONSUMER'S POINT OF VIEW ON THE ILLEGAL MARK. POURTANT REALIZE A FEW THINGS ONE THE ILLEGAL MARKET IS UBIQUITOUS AND READILY ACCESSIBLE THERE ARE VERY FEW BARRIERS TO ENTRY FROM THE CONSUMER'S PERSPECTIVE SECOND THE ILLEGAL MARKET HOLDS SOME ADVANTAGES OVER THE REGULATED MARKET THAT THE REGULATED MARKET WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO MATCH. THINGS LIKE THE ABILITY FOR CONSUMERS TO BET ON CREDIT THINGS LIKE THE ABILITIES TO BET IN A WAY THAT IS ANONYMOUS YOU'RE RELATIVELY OR HOLY AND YOU KNOW TO BE HONEST ABOUT IT THE ABILITY TO NOT PAY TAXES WHEN YOU WIN. AND OFFSHORE SITE OR WITHIN A LEGAL BOOKMAKER THE OTHER THING THAT THE ILLEGAL MARKET HAS GOING FOR IT IS THE FACT THAT IT IS AN ENTRENCHED HABIT FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CONSUMERS THE UPSHOT FROM ALL OF THIS IS THAT POLICY MAKERS MUST MAKE ALL DECISIONS WITH THE CONTEXT. OF RE IGNITING THE ILLEGAL MARKET IS HERE IT IS ACTIVE IT IS IT FRENCH AND IT WILL MAINTAIN SOME ADVANTAGES OVER THE LEGAL PRODUCT THAT CAN SIMPLY NEVER BE MATCHED BY THAT PRODUCT AS A RESULT I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR THE LEGAL MARKET TO BE CONSTRUCTED IN A WAY. THAT POSITIONS ITSELF AS THE MOST APPEALING OF ALTERNATIVE POSSIBLE TO THAT ILLEGAL MARKET NOT ONLY FOR THE GOOD OF THE MARKET IN TERMS OF A REVENUE PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM A MORE BASIC PUBLIC I'LL SEE FACTORED IN THE OUR- SITE CONNECT. ACTIVITY NOT KIND OF REVENUE OUT OF THE ILLEGAL MARKET WORK IT ALMOST INEVITABLY RESIDES EITHER DIRECTLY IN ORDER GRAYSON TO CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND THE AVAILABLE FOR. ALL I APPRECIATE THERE ARE SEVERAL YEARS BEHIND ME IF YOU ASK ME SINCE SIDE OF CON THIS YEAR IN MY CONTACT INFORMATION IS ON THE SCREEN AND IF I CAN BE A RESOURCE IN ANY WAY PLEASE DON'T HESITATE. TO REACH OUT. THANK YOU MOST OF OUR. BOTH FOR WITNESSES- SEVERAL REFERENCES ARE MADE RUN COURT DECISIONS AND SEVERAL STUDIES- I THINK BELIEVE YOU OFFER TO PROVIDE SOME SOURCE MATERIAL TO THE COMMITTEE SO IF YOU COULD PROVIDE- SOME OF THAT SOURCE MITCHELL BACKER MATERIAL IN WRITING THAT BE VERY HELPFUL AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND I KNOW WE HAVE THE POWER POINT HERE. IN OUR MINDS BUT SOME OF THE OTHER- REFERENCE FUTURE WOULD BE HELPFUL AS WELL. AS WELL AS THE FOR SPEAKER. GOT FOR BOTH. CUSTOMER. WITH THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS. HI YA. IN A PINCH HITTER HERE. SO KEEP A VERY BRIEF BUT YOU SAID INDIAN TRIBES ARE COMPLEX ON THIS ISSUE WHAT ARE THE TOP THREE COMPLEXITIES PLEASE. SURE SO I DON'T IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER- INDIAN TRIBES HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THE CONSTRAINTS OF A GRIP WHICH PLACES DIFFERENT CONSTRAINTS AROUND THEIR ABILITY TO OFFER ONLINE SPORTS BETTING VERSES HOW COMMERCIAL OPERATOR MIGHT APPROACH ONLINE SPORTS BETTING. TO SOME BUT NOT ALL MAY HAVE TO RE OPEN THEIR CONTACTS WITH THE STATE IN ORDER TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF SPORTS BETTING AND THEY MAY VIEW THAT AS A RISK THAT IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH TAKING FOR THE RELATIVE UPSIDE OF SPORTS BETTING AND FINALLY I THINK THAT. IF YOU AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK AS IF INDIAN COUNTRIES MARGINS BECAUSE IT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT BUT THERE I THINK IS A CONCERN THAT I'VE HEARD EXPRESSED IN INDIAN COUNTRY AMONG SOME TRIBES THAT THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF SPORTS BETTING SEEM RELATIVELY SMALL FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE. SLOT OF NEW FOR EXAMPLE. AND IN EACH INCH FOR OPENING THE DOOR EVEN THOSE RELATIVELY SMALL BENEFITS THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT OTHER KINDS OF GAMBLING MIGHT COME THROUGH THAT DOOR ONCE IT'S OPENED I OFTEN SAY THAT THE HISTORY OF GAMBLING IN THE U. S. IS A SERIES OF. MASSIVE EXCEPTIONS SQUEEZE THROUGH VERY SMALL LOOPHOLES THIS IS HOW YOU KNOW VARIOUS THINGS THAT WERE NOT SLOT MACHINES BECAME SLOT MACHINES RIGHT. SO I THINK THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT. WE'RE SAYING THIS IS THE EXPANSION TODAY. WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT EXPANSION IS GOING TO FOLLOW AS A RESULT SO LET'S PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO BECAUSE FRANKLY THE STATUS QUO IS WORKING QUITE WELL FOR US. THANK YOU AND DANTE AND THEY HAVECERTAIN THAT THERE. I JUST WANTED TO CHRISS COMMENT ABOUT THE COMPLICATIONS POSED BY A GROW WHICH IS ACRONYM FOR THE INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT THERE IS. SOME LEGAL UNCERTAINTY OVER WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT- KICK INDIAN TRIBES CAN OR FROM MOBILE BETTING- THERE'S SME PROBLEMATIC CASE LAW OUT OF THE NINTH CIRCUIT U. S. COURT OF APPEALS. WHICH PLACES THAT QUESTION AT ISSUE- I THINK OF THE IF IT PAID TRIBES- CASE- IT MAYBE NOT PRONOUNCING IT CORRECTLY. AND THERE'S A AND I. G. C. NATIONAL INDIAN GAMING COMMISSION- ADVISORY OPINION- THAT SUGGESTS- THAT. YOU KNOW UNDER THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE SINCE IT GROW APPLIES TO GAMING ON INDIAN LANDS. THAT THERE MAY BE SOME COMPLICATIONS WITH. INDIAN TRIBES- BE ABLE TO OFFER COMPETITIVE MOBILE BETTING PRODUCTS AND AT THE SAME TIME TO REMEDY AND ALLEVIATE THAT TO THEIR PLAN- PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND INTRODUCED IN THE U. S. CONGRESS- ALLOW. INDIAN TRIBES TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT MORE SPORTS WAGERING OPERATIONS SO THOSE TWO THOSE TWO AVENUES KIND OF WORK TOGETHER. AND I CAN'T SPEAK FOR WHAT THE TRIBES MOTIVATION IS BUT IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THEIR RELUCTANCE. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH MOBILE BETTING IN SPORTS IN IN IN CALIFORNIA COULD BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MARKING THIS OF THE LEGAL QUESTION OVER WHETHER THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO IT. AND THERE'S CERTAINLY A MOVEMENT IN CONGRESS- TO REMEDY THAT SITUATION AND PUT THEM. ON EQUAL FOOTING. WITH NON TRIBAL OPERATORS. SEC OR JUST. PROBABLY MORE OF A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION THEN- ACTUAL QUESTION GIVE ME A LITERATURE OR- ANY EVIDENCE- THAT COULD HELP US UNDERSTAND THE ROLE- THAT- THE CHINA- MADE BEAR ON THIS ISSUE DOWN THE ROAD ALL IN TERMS OF SPORTS BETTING ONLINE% BETTING WEATHER BEATER MACAU BLACK MARKET- EVEN AUTHORIZED I KNOW THEY HAVE- STRONG PROTECTIONS IN PLACE ON THE INTERNET AND WHAT NOT BUT- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR INSIGHTS INTO WHAT ROLE THEY PLAY OR MY PLAYING THE FUTURE. FROM A POLICYMAKERS MAKERS PERSPECTIVE I THINK THE ONE QUESTION AS MOST LIKELY TO COME INTO YOUR YOUR ORBIT IS THIS QUESTION OF WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT LICENSE SEEN AN OPERATOR OR A SOFTWARE PROVIDER PLATFORM PROVIDER ARE THEY DOING BUSINESS IN THAT MARKET ILLEGALLY AND WHAT KIND OF RAMIFICATIONS DOES THAT HAVE IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO SECURE A LICENSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OTHERWISE GENERALLY SPEAKING I'M NOT SURE THAT TO MARKETS ARE HER LIKE THEY DID IN FACT- ANYTIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT EIGHT AND HAPPY TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION ALSO HAS A RIGHT NOW MACAU ALLOWS OUR DISALLOWS. TRONIC CURRENT. STATUS ONLINE IN CHINA BROADLY IS THAT'S DISALLOWED MECCA THANK YOU. NATIONAL QUESTIONS MEMBERS. CENTER YES THANK YOU THE- YOUR YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE BALLOT AND THE COURSES THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY VOTING AND THAT SORT OF THING SO THE COMPARISON OF THE TWO WHAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY YOU THINK HOW THE GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD SEE IF WE WENT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND THE LAST IS- WE DID TALK THE TALK ABOUT CRIME WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE BLACK MARKET WE TALKED ABOUT ILLEGAL GAMBLING. AND YOU GIVE US SOME RAIMES JUST ACCEPT HAVE IT- AND HOW WE CAN ELIMINATE THAT BY MAKING THIS LEGAL. WELL MAYBE CHRIS CAN BETTER ADDRESS THAT ISSUE BUT CERTAINLY- WITHIN THE LEGISLATIVE PREROGATIVE. IF YOU PASS AND CONTROL THE- REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND LEGAL ENVIRONMENT DRAFT TO LAWS. YOU CAN CONTROL IT A LITTLE BIT MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN- LEAVING A PURELY TO A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO ENACT ENABLING LEGISLATION ANYWAY. SO IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT- THOSE THAT ARE YOU KNOW MOST DISADVANTAGED OR PERHAPS- YOU KNOW VULNERABLE. TO CRIME OR OR PROBLEM RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING ON THAT WOULD BE COMING UPON THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY TO- YOU KNOW- LEGISLATE BEST PRACTICES TO DEAL WITH THOSE SITUATIONS BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY STATISTICS ARE. ANECDOTAL INFORMATION ON ON- YOU KNOW CRIME. YOU KNOW CRIME RISKS BUT I DO BELIEVE. VERY STRONGLY THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION DOES NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY BEING ABLE TO DRAFTING AND ENACT. ITS OWN SPORTS WAGERING STATUTE THAT CREATES A BEST PRACTICE FOR CALIFORNIA AS THIS LEGISLATURE SEES FIT. AND LASTLY HAVE YOU DONE ANY PAULINE ON. WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD LOOK LIKE- WHEN FACED WITH THIS OPPORTUNITY YES OR NO. WELL THERE'S BEEN NO SPECIFIC POLLING THAT I'M AWARE OF IN CALIFORNIA I KNOW WHEN IT CAME IN COLORADO- PULLING WAS HEAVILY IN FAVOR OF SPORTS BETTING- BEING- PASSED. THROUGH THE CONSTITUTIONAL BALLOT QUESTION. BUT THERE'S BEEN NO PULL UP ON THE ISSUE. PUBLIC FEEL ABOUT. IT SHOULD BE A VOTE OF PEOPLE OR ALLOW THE DULY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES- TO PASS A SPORTS BETTING STATUTE BUT THERE ARE NUMEROUS POLLS. THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED NATIONWIDE SETON HALL- THE AMERICAN GAMING ASSOCIATION HAS A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT. THE PUBLIC'S- ACCEPTABILITY AND BEING IN FAVOR OF REGULATED SPORTS BETTING- TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN PASSED BUT WAS ENACTED IT WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT IT WAS PRE INTERNET. LARGELY PUT AN AD. IN THE AFTERMATH. OF THE P. O.'S SCANDAL THERE ARE ONLY TWO STATES. IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THAT EVEN HAD CASINOS SO TODAY IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WE HAVE FORTY STATES THAT HAVE COMMERCIAL CASINOS. DAILY FANTASY SPORTS IS WIDELY AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED MOST STATES- GAMBLING HAS BECOME A MUCH BIGGER PART OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ON A STATE BY STATE BASIS AND THE POLLS TEND TO SHOW INCREASING PUBLIC SUPPORT. FOR LEGALIZED SPORTS BETTING. AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT PUBLIC SUPPORT WOULD BE THE FACT THAT THERE WOULD BE REVENUE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH HOUSING SCHOOLS- OUR HIGHWAYS TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. EVERYTHING IN GENERAL THAT STILL NEEDED BUT BUT THAT'S PART OF IT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON CERTAINLY- THE NUMBER OF NUMBERS YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO LOVE SPORTS AND WANT TO HAVE YOU KNOW WON'T WANT TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES. WHAT KIND OF YOU KNOW BEHAVIOR TO IT TO ENGAGE IN IT MINUTES THERE IT'S THEIR RIGHT TO PLACE A BAD AND I THINK. SO MANY PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY SAFELY INSTEAD OF BEING RELEGATED TO THE ILLEGAL MARKET WHERE THERE ARE NO CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THERE ARE NO RECOURSE. AND THERE'S NO REGULATOR TO- TURN TO IF THE OPERATOR GOES BELLY UP SO THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE FACED WITH IS NOT WHETHER SPORTS BETTING WILL EXIST OR NOT EXIST BELIEVE ME IT EXISTS. AND WE CAN DEBATE THE NUMBERS WHETHER IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION ANNUALLY OR CHRIS IS MORE MODEST NUMBER BUT IS IT IS A SIGNIFICANT- ACTIVITY THAT'S OCCURRING REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU CHOOSE TO LEGALIZE IT OR NOT. AND HE IN IN IN YOUR RECOGNIZING THAT I CREATING A SAFE. ROBUST REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR CONSUMERS TO SAFELY ON SPORTS AND POSE PROTECTIONS FOR PROBLEM GAMBLERS IN ANY OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU THINK RISE TO THE LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE. THAT COULD BE FOR YOU TO ADDRESS INSTEAD OF HOPING THAT THINGS YOU DON'T GO WELL BUT STICK STICKING YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND AND PRETENDING IT DOESN'T IT'S NOT EXISTING. I THINK IS- IT IS THE BEST OPTION IN ACTION. WILL ALL THIS ACTIVITY TO FLORIDA OFFSHORE BE ABLE TO. THE MOBILE STE. THANK. THE BILL FOR ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS VISITING HIS BELOVED BOSTON RED SOX IN PLACES A BAD AT THE PARK TO BEAT THE NEW YORK YANKEES. HELP OTHER STATES FIGURE OUT HOW THE MONEY IS. ALLOCATED TO STATES AND RESIDENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER WHERE THE BEST PLACE THIS IS WHERE THE BET IS CONSIDERED FOR TERMS OF THAT TAX REVENUE SO. THAT A MASSACHUSETTS COUNT AS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT CALIFORNIANS NOT. WELL YOU CAN'T DO THAT TODAY WE HAVE TO FEDERAL WIRE ACT NOT I THINK IT I THINK IT WAS AND IF YOU TRAVEL TO MASSACHUSETTS YOU PLACE A BET MASSACHUSETTS THAT'S REVENUE FOR MASSACHUSETTS OPERATOR TAX BY THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. OKAY BUT CALIFORNIA GETS NONE OF ITS RESIDENTS BETTING. ELSEWHERE NO SORRY. THANK YOU. THE. THIS WORK IF YOU COULD- I KNOW CHAIRMAN DODD WAS VISITING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND HAD TO STEP OUT OF THE HEARING FOR A FEW MINUTES YOU TOUCHED ON THE ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL- IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH LEGISLATURE WHICH IS WHETHER TO PURSUE- LEGALIZATION SPORTS WAGERING VIA A NEW SHIP THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUTS ON THE BALLOT OR WHETHER WE PURSUE SOMETHING. THROUGH LEGISLATION IN STATUTE YOU MADE THE SUGGESTION THAT YOUR OPINION. WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY LEGAL AUTHORITY TO PURSUE LEGISLATION. COULD YOU WALK US THROUGH THAT ONE MORE TIME FOR THE MEMBERS KAY WITHOUT NOTES- I AM ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. CERTAIN THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION DOES NOT REQUIRE A BALLOT QUESTION FOR SPORTS BETTING AND I GUESS I SHOULD STAND UP- SO I CAN BE BETTER NO NO MORE AUDIBLE. THERE ARE ONLY CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION THAT ARE POTENTIALLY CONCERNING ONE IS SECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY OF. ARTICLE FOUR I BELIEVE EIGHT PROHIBITS CASINOS CASINO GAMBLING. CASINOS OF THE TYPE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN NEW IN IN NEVADA AND NEW JERSEY. AND THIS CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION FROM NINETEEN NINETY NINE HOTEL AND RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION THAT'S THE NAME OF THE CASE. THE SUPREME COURT INTERPRETED THAT NO CASINOS LANGUAGE TO APPLY ONLY TO BUILDINGS OR ROOMS- THAT HAVE GAMBLING ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD THEN CURRENTLY BEING OPERATED. IN NEW JERSEY AND NEVADA SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T ADDRESS TO PROHIBIT CASINO GAMBLING OR GAMBLING CATEGORIES IT SPEAKS TO PHYSICAL STRUCTURES AND FACILITIES AND IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY ENCOMPASS SPORTS BETTING BECAUSE- WITHIN THIS VERY DETAILED COURT OPINION- THE SUPREME COURT INTERPRETS WHAT IS MEANT BY THE WORDS. CURRENTLY OPERATING IS THIS- CURRENTLY OPERATING IN ALASKA CONCEPT THAT WE WOULD BASICALLY- UPS I TO ACTIVITY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY NO THIS CREAM COURT. SAID THAT IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO CONSTRUCT CURRENTLY OPERATING AT REFERRING TO THE STATE OF IS WHICH THIS. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR HELLO. THIS IS STATION TO CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WE'RE SPENDING WAS FOUND IN NEVADA CASINOS BUT NOT IN NEW JERSEY CASINOS IT WOULD BE ANOTHER THIRTY TWO YEARS BEFORE NEW JERSEY CASINOS HAD THE LAWFUL ABILITY TO OFFER SPORTS WAGERING AS AN AMENITY SO SPORTS BETTING AS A- AS A FORM OF GAMBLING IS NOT COVERED BY THIS CONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON CASINOS- WHICH LOOKS TO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND FOCUSES ONLY ON BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES. THE OTHER POTENTIAL CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION THAT COULD APPLY HERE IS SECTION NINETEEN F. OF ARTICLE FOR WHICH IS THE INDIAN GAMING COMPACT LANGUAGE WHICH GIVES THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA HEY AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO TRIBAL GAMING CONDO- CONTACTS WITH THE INDIAN TRIBES FOR THREE DISCRETE CATEGORIES OF GAMBLING LOTTERIES. I BELIEVE SLOT MACHINES AND PERCENTAGE AND BANKING CARD GAMES THIS SUB SPECIES OF GAMBLING WHICH THE GOVERNOR HAS THE RIGHT AND THE ABILITY TO ENTER INTO GAMING COMPACTS WITH CALIFORNIA'S TRIBES NO WHERE IN SECTION NINETEEN ELF OF ARTICLE FOUR IS THERE ANY PROHIBITORY LANGUAGE IT DOESN'T SAY. THE STATE SHALL NOT ALLOW ANY OTHER OPERATOR TO OFFER A DIFFERENT FORM A CLASS FOR GAMBLING IT'S AN IT'S A SIMPLE AUTHORIZATION PROVISION AND THE WAY I READ BANKING AND PERCENTAGE CAR GAMES IS IT DOESN'T MEAN ALL HOUSE BANKING GAMES IT FOCUSES ONLY ON CARD GAMES AND HOW DO WE KNOW THIS- IN IN TWO THOUSAND ONE PROPOSITIONONE EIGHTY I MEAN. I DID MY RESEARCH PROPOSITION ONE AA WAS THE- THAT LET YOU KNOW TRIBAL CASINO GAMING ON INDIAN LANDS AND AT THE TIME OF THE FOR YOU THE NONPARTISAN COMMITTEE OR AGENCY CALLED THE LEAD PLAINTIFF ANALYST'S OFFICE THE WAY- THE INTERPRET. THE BALLOT CHOOSE THE BENEFIT. THE ISSUE VOTER PAMPHLETS THESE. GUYS AND THEN. THE BODY OF THIS VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE I MEAN I HAVE COPY IT'S ONLINE ANYBODY CAN SEARCH FOR IT VERY EASILY IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO FIND- BUT THE LA- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST INTERPRETED THE WORDS OF BANKING AND PERCENTAGE CARD GAME. AS REFERRING ONLY TO CARD GAMES NOT TO ALL HOUSE BANKING GAMES NOT OF SPORTS BETTING NOT TO ANYTHING ELSE SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY EVIDENCE THAT EXISTED AT THE TIME. PUBLIC STATEMENTS MADE BY STATE OFFICIALS AND TRIBAL OFFICIALS COURT DECISIONS LANGUAGE IN COMPAQ'S THEY ALL POINT TO A SINGULAR CONCLUSION. WHICH IS THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE GIVING THE GOVERNOR THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO TRAVEL CONTACTS FOR LIMITED FORMS OF PLASTER REGAINING. DOES NOT PROHIBIT- THE AUTHORIZATION OF SPORTS BETTING BY THE LEGISLATURE THERE THERE ARE LIKE YOU KNOW THEIR SHIPS PASSING IN THE NIGHT HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH ONE ANOTHER SO REALLY THE FOR THE TWO THE TWO PILLARS OF THE ARGUMENT OR THAT THE NOTE THE NO CASINO LANGUAGE. ONLY APPLIES TO THE BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES AND THE TRIBAL CONTACTING LANGUAGE ONLY AFFECTS THE A LIMITED SPECIES OF CLASS THREE GAMES AND ONE OF THOSE LIMITED SPECIES HAVE A PERCENTAGE IN BANKING- BANKING A PERCENTAGE CARD GAMES ONLY REFERS TO CARD GAMES. NOT TO OLD YOU KNOW HOUSE BANKING AIMS OR WHENEVER- WHENEVER BETTER WAGES AGAINST THE HOUSE IT'S LIMITED TO CARD GAMES ONLY. SO YOU HAVE A CLEAR PATHWAY TO ENACT A STATUTE THAT PROVIDES FOR SPORTS BETTING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT ANY CONCERN I MEAN OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE IF THEY COULD BE LEGAL CHALLENGES BUT I ASSURE YOU I DELVED DEEPLY INTO THIS. AND YOU COULD LOOK AT THE CONTACTS A NUMBER OF COURT DECISIONS THE VOTER PAMPHLETS THAT WERE ISSUED IN TWO THOUSAND AND- YET AT THE LAWYER AS A TRIAL LEARNING HELLO LAWYER WE HAVE. A COP. PULLED ME SING EVIDENCE IS WAY BEYOND. I THINK IF YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH YOUR HOMEWORK- YOU'LL FIND THAT THERE'S NO CONSTITUTIONAL BARRIER TO THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORIZATION OF SPORTS BETTING IN CALIFORNIA. WAS THAT. I THINK THAT'S SUFFICIENT DETAIL FOR NOW I KNOW WE HAVE- MEMBERS LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HERE IN THE ROOM WITH US I'M SURE THEY'RE TAKING NOTES SO THAT ALL THE ATTORNEYS CAN ARGUE LATER. BUT. WE WILL LET WE APPRECIATE THE CLARITY AND- AND REVIEWING THAT ONE MORE TIME FOR THE COMMITTEE. DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME FOR THIS PANEL. SEEING NONE THANK YOU HOLDING YOUR TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE SECOND PANEL MEMBERS THE- ESSENTIALS OF SPORTS BETTING KEYS TO A SUCCESSFUL. SPORTS BETTING MARKET WE'RE GOING TO WELCOME FOR THEIR TESTIMONY DANIEL SHAPIRO VICE PRESIDENT OF STRATEGY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT WILLIAM HILL. J. CORNING GAVE VICE PRESIDENT OF RACE AND SPORTS BOOK OPERATIONS AT THE WESTGATE LAS VEGAS RESORT CASINO. MARK NELSON CORPORATE DIRECTOR OF RACE AND SPORTS AT LANDIS CASINO AS WELL AS MATT SHELBY PUBLIC INFORMATION MANAGER FOR THE ORGAN LOTTERY- GERMAN THANK YOU. FOR BEING HERE TODAY TRAVELING TO SHARE YOUR TEST MY WITH THIS AND WHEN YOU'RE PREPARED LET'S BEGIN OVER HERE ON THE RIGHT AND. GOOD AFTERNOON CENTER DODD ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DAN SHAPIRO AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF STRATEGY AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT FOR WILLIAM HILL US. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS A RESOURCE AS YOU DISCUSS SPORTS PAIN AND COMMEND YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR TAKING STEPS TO LEGALIZE SPORTS BETTING. WHICH WERE ABLE CALIFORNIA TO KEEP PACE WITH STATES COMPETE WITH A THRIVING BLACK MARKET WHICH WILL NOT USUALLY GO AWAY. THE BENEFITS OF LEGAL SPORTS BETTING MARKET ARE NUMEROUS. IN ADDITION TO GENERATING TAX REVENUE LEGALIZED SPORTS WRITING CREATES JOBS PROTECT PROTECT CONSUMERS ESTABLISHES RESPONSIBLE GAMING PRACTICES. AND HELPS PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF SPORTING EVENTS. LET ME START WITH A BIT OF BACKGROUND ON WILLIAM HILL. WILLIAM HILL IS WHEN THE LEADING SPORTS BETTING COMPANIES IN THE WORLD IT IS OPERATED IN NINETY KINGDOM AND OTHER COUNTRIES MORE THAN EIGHTY FIVE YEARS. HAS BEEN TAKING THAT'S IN THE U. S. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. OUR US BUSINESS IS HEADQUARTERED IN NEVADA WHERE WE ARE MARK WE ARE THE MARKET LEADER AND WE OPERATE ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN RETAIL SPORTS BOOKS. LOCATED WITHIN CASINOS. ARE ALL ROUND OF THAT. WE ALSO OP OPERATE THE LEADING MOBILE APPLICATION IN THE STATE OF NEVADA. SINCE THE SUPREME COURT RULING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE'VE EXPANDED ACROSS THE U. S. PRETTY RAPIDLY. WE'VE TAKEN LEGAL BETS AND NINE OTHER STATES AND WE PANEL ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE LEGAL SPORTS BETS PLACED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SINCE THE SUPREME COURT RULED. SO WILLIAM HILL WORKS WITH CASINOS RACE TRACKS LOTTERIES AND OTHER LICENSE HOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO PROVIDE SPORTS BEEN SERVICES UNDER VARIOUS MODELS. DEPENDING ON STATE LAW AND REGULATIONS. SPORTS BETTING IS A HIGHLY COMPLEX AND SPECIALIZED BUSINESS. OUR SERVICES ALLOW PROPERTIES HAVE A WORLD CLASS SPORTS BEEN OFFERING WHILE THEY FOCUS ON THEIR CORE REVENUE GENERATING ACTIVITIES SUCH A SLOT MACHINES TABLE GAMES HOTEL OPERATIONS AND FOOD AND BEVERAGE. OUR PRIMARY OPERATING MODEL WERE PERMITTED IS TO PROVIDE A FULLY OUTSOURCED SOLUTION WE EMPLOY AND TRAIN THE SPORTS BOOK STAFF. WE PROVIDE A PROPRIETARY PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY. THE ODDS AND RISK MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE AND OTHER SERVICES REQUIRED OPERATE. BECAUSE OF OUR SIZE AND SCALE WE CAN PROVIDE THE SPORTS BEEN OPERATION MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN A SINGLE PROPERTY. COULD DO ON THEIR OWN. FOR PROPERTIES WITH SPORTS BOOKS THE BENEFITS OF LEGAL SPORTS BETTING ARE NUMEROUS AND THEY RUN BEYOND TO DEREGULATE REVENUES SPORTS BETTING PRODUCES. SPORTS BETTING LEADS TO INCREASE VISITATION AND FOOD AND BEVERAGE REVENUES. MANY SPORTS BETTORS ALSO CROSS OVER TO OTHER FORMS OF GAMING PRIMARILY TABLE GAMES. SPORTS BETTING ALSO HELPS CREATE MAJOR EVENT HOLIDAYS AND CASINOS SUPERBOWL IN MARCH MADNESS COLLEGE BASKETBALL TURNER TWO GOOD EXAMPLES OF THAT THEIR TO THE BUSIEST TIMES IN THE CASINOS IN NEVADA. SO THE TWENTY STATES THAT OF AUTHORITY SPORTS BETTING EACH IS DONE IT A BIT DIFFERENTLY AS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS- WITNESSES. IN NEVADA WHERE SPORTS BETTING HAS BEEN LEGAL IN CASINOS SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THERE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND NINETY RETAIL SPORTS BOOKS. LOCATED ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF NEVADA. THEY COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES REALLY. FROM SMALL SELF SERVICE KIOSK OPERATIONS TO VERY LARGE HUNDRED. TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT FACILITIES YOU MIGHT SEE IN LAS VEGAS STRIP. IN NEVADA MOBILE SPORTS BETTING IS ALSO BEEN PERMITTED SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN. IN ORDER TO SIGN UP FOR YOUR MOBILE SPORTSMAN ACCOUNT A CUSTOMER MUST GO FIRST INTO A CASINO TO SIGN UP. AFTER ESTABLISHING THE ACCOUNT THE CUSTOMER CAN AND THAT FROM ANYWHERE WITHIN THE BORDERS OF THE STATE. IS ALSO METHODS OF DEPOSITING WITHDRAWING FUNDS ELECTRONICALLY AWAY FROM THE SPORTS BOOK. IN A VAT OF FOR WILLIAM HILL ABOUT 70% OF OUR BUSINESS IS OVER MOBILE DEVICES. IN NEW JERSEY WHICH IS CURRENTLY THE SECOND LARGEST MARKET IN THE U. S. BEHIND OF THAT AT THEIR SPORTS BOOKS IN THE CASINOS AUTOMATIC CITY. AND AT THE RACE TRACKS. IN NEW JERSEY THE LAW REQUIRES CUSTOMERS- PERMITS CUSTOMERS REGISTER FOR MOBILE SPORTS BETTING FROM ANYWHERE IN THE STATE SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY GOING TO A CASINO RACETRACK. IN NEW JERSEY ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE SPORTS BETTING HANDLE WHICH IS A MALE WAGERED- IS WAGERED THROUGH MOBILE DEVICES AND ONLINE CHANNELS. RECOGNIZING THE CALIFORNIA'S MANY STAKEHOLDERS IN A THRIVING TRIBAL GAMING MARKET WE BELIEVE IT IS A PUBLIC POLICY DECISION AS TO WHERE LEGAL SPORTS BETTING WOULD BE PERMITTED. WHETHER OR MOBILE SPORTS BETTING WILL BE ALLOWED AND IF SO HOW WHEN WHERE CUSTOMERS MAY SIGN UP FOR THEIR ACCOUNT. SO FAR I ONE RHODE ISLAND HAVE FALLEN OF THAT IS MODEL WITH RETAIL SPORTS BOOKS IN CASINOS. AND IN PERSON SIGN UPS FOR MOBILE ACCOUNTS. OTHER STATES LIKE INDIANA AND PENNSYLVANIA HAVE FOLLOW THE NEW JERSEY MODEL IN WHICH REMOTE MOBILE APP REGISTRATION IS PERMITTED. STILL OTHER STATES LIKE MISSISSIPPI HAVE PERMITTED ONLY RETAIL SPORTS BETTING. SO AS YOU THINK ABOUT SPORTS BETTING CALIFORNIA I LIKE TO REALLY DISCUSS TO MATTERS- THEIR TAX RATES AND BETTING ON COLLEGE SPORTS. SO WHILE SPORTS BETTING IS GONNA GENERATE REVENUE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN IT IS LEGAL. THE REALITY SPORTS BETTING IS A LOW MARGIN BUSINESS. THE AVERAGE HOLD WHICH IS ABOUT RETAIN BY THIS THE OPERATORS AFTER PAYING THE WING CUSTOMERS IS AROUND 5% GIVE OR TAKE. THAT WIN PERCENTAGE IS MUCH MUCH LOWER THAN YOU'D FIND CASINO GAMES OR IMPAIR MUTUAL HORSE RACING. MEANWHILE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND COMPLEXITIES AND OPERATE IN A SPORTS BOOK. SO BECAUSE OF THE LOW THE LOW MARGINS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE TAX RATE BE REASONABLE. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE NEVADA WHICH IS STILL THE LARGEST SPORTS BETTING MARKET IN THE US NEXT DOOR- THE TAX RATE IS SIX POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT- IOWA WHICH IS ANOTHER STATE TO LEGALIZE SPORTS BETTING LAST YEAR- ALSO HAS A SIX POINT 75% TAX. NEW JERSEY- THEY SPLIT THE TAX RATE IN FOR LAND BASED CASINOS IT'S NINE POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT- AND FOR MOBILE SPORTS MINUTES THE COURT APPOINTED PANEL THAT WAS DISCUSSED BEFORE- TAX FEDERAL EXCISE TAX ON THE HANDLE OF THE AMOUNT WAGERED WHICH GOES THE IRS. SO REALLY ANY MORE TAXES OR FEES OR ROYALTIES OR INTEGRITY FEES REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FROM THE OPERATORS TO MOVE- YOU KNOW THE CUSTOMERS FROM THE BLACK MARKET TO LEGAL MARKET WHICH IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. IT IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO REALLY MARKET THE PRODUCT AND REALLY INNOVATE IN PRICE THE PRODUCT PEDAL LEE WITH THE WITH THE OFFSHORE. AND ILLEGAL OPERATORS. WELL TO ME THEY'RE REALLY THE TRUE COMPETITION WHEN LEGAL SPORTS BETTING COMES IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT SPORTS PAIN HAS BEEN AROUND IN NEVADA FOR MANY MANY YEARS IT'S LIVE IN OREGON AND IT'S ALIVE AND IN MANY OTHER STATES SO FAR. AND THE COMPETITION WHICH IS IT THESE ILLEGAL BOOKMAKERS THEY DON'T ONLY PAY NOTE ANY TAXES OR FEES BUT THEY HAVE NO COMPLIANCE COSTS. THEY MUST FOLLOW ALL- STATE REGULATIONS FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND THE COST TO COMPLY- IS SUBSTANTIAL BEYOND THE TAX RATES IN OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. THE FINAL SUBJECT ALL TALK I'LL TOUCH ON IS COLLEGE SPORTS. SO IN A VAT OF WERE PERMITTED TO TAKE WAGERS ON YOU AND ALL THE AND YOU ON OUR- UNIVERSITY THAT A LAS VEGAS UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA RENO. BUT SOME STATES HAVE DECIDED NOT TO PERMIT WAGER IN OUR LOCAL COLLEGE TEAMS. BUT IF CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL OPERATORS CANNOT OFFER BETTING ON COLLEGE SPORTS. IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO MIGRATE CUSTOMERS FROM THE BLACK MARKET. IT'S REALLY HARD TO EXPECT CUSTOMERS TO BED AND LEGAL MARKET WHEN ILLEGAL BOOKIES ONLY ONE OFFERING UCLA BASKETBALL OR STANFORD FOOTBALL. OR ANY OF THE LOCAL COLLEGE TEAMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BETTING ON COLLEGE SPORTS IS REALLY ESSENTIAL FOR THE ABILITY OF THE LEGAL BOOKMAKERS TO COMPETE WITH THE OFFSHORE AND ILLEGAL OPERATORS. SO CLOSE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY AND SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS TO LEGALIZE SPORTS BETTING I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS YOU WISH. THANK YOU FOR CORD. DISCARDED. MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIRMAN- MEMBERS- IT'S A IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE AN HONOR TO BE HERE AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MONIES J. CORNING A- I RUN THE- WESTGATE RACE AND SPORTS BOOK IT'S THE IT IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST RACES SPORTS BOOK WITH ALMOST A THIRTY THOUSAND SQUARE FEET. I'VE BEEN IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY FOR JUST OVER A THIRTY HERE'S AND. WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN RUNNING A SPORTS BOOK SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE- UNFORTUNATELY- I FOUND IT RIGHT BEFORE WE CAME UP HERE THAT WE HAD SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AND I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SHOW MY POWER POINT PRESENTATION BUT I'M GONNA TRY TO. DESCRIBE IT IS BEST I CAN. NO THAT IS ACTUALLY- BEEN TAKING WAITERS ON ON SPORTING EVENTS SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES- BUT IT WASN'T REALLY UNTIL THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THAT TO THE RETAIL BOOKS AS WE SEE TODAY WERE PROMINENT- THERE WERE SOME TAX RATE CHANGES- THAT ALLOWED OR OR PREVENTED- OPERATORS FROM SEEKING- RETAIL OUTLETS UNTIL THEY GOT TO A POINT WHERE IS VERY COMFORTABLE AND THEY KNEW-THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE PROFITABLE. AS DAN SAID WE HAVE- CURRENTLY IN THE STATE OF THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND NINETY SPORTS BOOKS. WHEN THEY BREAK DOWN AT. SOME OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE MODERN SPORTS BETTER- THERE 88% MALE- THE H. SEGMENTS UNDER TWENTY NINE REPRESENTS ABOUT 40% OF THEM THIRTY TO FORTY NINE TO TWENTY SIX PERCENT. OVER FIFTY IS THIRTY FOUR. THE ECONOMIC CLASS THE PREDOMINANTLY OF MIDDLE CLASS- THEIR AVERAGE INCOME IS JUST MORE THAN- SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND. DOLLARS THERE ARE MULTIPLE MARK COLLEGE EDUCATED AND- THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE A POLITICAL AFFILIATION. LOOKING OVER THE GROWTH OF NEVADA I MEAN. AS DAN SAID MOBILE WAGERING WAS APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN AND- WE SAW IT ESCALATED GROWTH THAT AT THAT POINT IN TIME. BREAKING THE SPORTS DOWN BY SEGMENT. YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT AS AS FAR AS POPULARITY OF FOOTBALL REPRESENTS ABOUT 35% OF ALL WAGERS THAT'S COLLEGE AND PRO BASKETBALL ABOUT 30% BASEBALL FIFTEEN AND ALL OTHER SPORTS SOCCER TENNIS NASCAR GOLF REPRESENT ABOUT 20% THIS DAN WAS MENTIONING ABOUT NEVADA OFFERINGS WILL LEVY STARTED ACCEPTING WAGERS ON YOU YOU AND ARE AND YOU KNOW BE GAMES IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. AND GOING BACK TO THAT TIME IT WAS IT WAS A IT WAS BROUGHT TO US BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION ACTUALLY BY SENATOR MCCAIN BACK IN THE DAY STATING THAT YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T ACCEPTING WAGERS ON OUR OWN SCHOOLS SO WE DID LOOK INTO IT AND WE NOTICED THAT AND THIS IS TRUE THAT MOST OF THOSE BETS THAT WERE HAPPENING ON THOSE SCHOOLS WERE TAKING PLACE THROUGH ILLEGAL CHANNELS. IN SO WITH WHAT'S WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCES WOULD YOU RATHER ACCEPT WAGERS IN A REGULATED CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT OR WOULD THE SILICON COUNTS BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GOWE HAVE HOSTED OR TAKEN WAGERS ON LOCAL EVENTS LOCAL SCHOOL EVENTS I'D SAY OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS NEARLY A THOUSAND EVENTS WITH NO ISSUES. NO PROBLEMS NO SERIOUS. WAS THAT THE WORD. YEAH I APOLOGIZE- BUT- YES THE IT WAS IT'S JUST OVER A THOUSAND EVENTS THAT WE HAVE ACCEPTED WITH NO- INCIDENTS OR OR ISSUES NOW AS FAR AS- THE HOST EVENTS THAT WE HAVE. IN LAS VEGAS OR IN NEVADA WE'RE LOOKING AT ALMOST FIFTEEN HUNDRED EVENTS THAT WE HAVE HOSTED OVER THE LAST. SAY TWENTY FIVE YEARS WITH THEIR COLLEGE EVENTS OR PRO EVENTS- AT THE PROXIMITY HAS NOTHING. TO DO WITH IT WE ARE ABLE TO ACCEPT THESE WAGERS EVEN THOUGH THESE EVENTS ARE TAKING PLACE RIGHT DOWN THE STREET AGAIN MORE COMFORTABLE ACCEPTING THESE WAGERS IN A CONTROLLED. REGULATED ENVIRONMENT. AS AS DAN MENTIONED- ABOUT THE MOBILE AYE AYE AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO GO INTO NOW IS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MOBILE WAGERING AND I KNOW THAT THE OTHER TESTIMONY AT ALSO- ADDRESS THIS AS WELL- WE HAVE SEEN JUST TREMENDOUS GROWTH SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN WHERE MOST PROMINENT OPERATORS AND LAS VEGAS IN NEVADA ACTUALLY DID NOT OFFER A MOBILE WAGERING UNTIL TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TWO THOUSAND. FIFTEEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT WAGERED THAT- HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE LAST- EIGHT OR NINE YEARS GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND TEN IT'S TWO POINT SEVEN SIX BILLION. TWO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN JUST OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IN ABOUT WAGERING. THE. THE PERCENT OF. OF TOTAL GAMING WHEN HAS INCREASED FROM POINT SIX IN THE EARLY NINETIES TO ALMOST TWO POINT FIVE- THAT'S SPORTS WAGERING SPORTS WAGERING NOW REPRESENTS A TWO POINT 5% OF TOTAL GAMING WENT IN THE BACK IN AGAIN MOST OF THAT'S THROUGH THE- OPTION. I'M TRYING TO DESCRIBE THE IS A- THE SLIDES AS BEST I CAN. THERE'S A COUPLE OF. OF A IMPORTANT NUMBERS HERE WHEN YOU LOOK UP. AT. NUMBERS PRIOR TO MOBILE WAGERING AND GOING THROUGH THE GROW THROUGH THE FIRST FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE MOBILE WAGERING THE GROWTH OF HANDLE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT ARE RIGHT WAS 14% THAT'S IN FIFTEEN YEARS OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS AFTER MOBILE WAGERING GROWTH AS A IS HAS GROWN 93% WITH THE WIN GROWTH OF A HUNDRED AND 9% SO YOU CAN SEE THE IMPACT THAT MOBILE WAGERING HAS ON THE BOTTOM LINE. I KNOW THAT THE A LOT OF YOU GUYS HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED ON A OF WHAT STATES OF ACTUALLY ARE CURRENTLY ACCEPTING WAGERS NEVADA PENNSYLVANIA INDIANA IOWA. WEST VIRGINIA RHODE ISLAND MISSISSIPPI ORGAN WE HAVE STATES- A NUMBER OF STATES EIGHT OR NINE THAT ARE AWAITING REGULATION. SUMMARIZING ALL THIS I MEAN I I'M ACTUALLY A BOOKMAKER THAT. HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME IN THE STATE NEVADA I- I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THE GROWTH A LOT OF. I MEAN WE'VE HAD A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY CORRECTED AND- OVER TIME. THE. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER A THE LAST TWO DECADES WE WERE ABLE TO CORRECT AND MORE TO A POINT WHERE- STATE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA IS PROBABLY THE LEADER IN AND- REGULATION AND HOUSE RULES AND- SPORTS BETTING ENVIRONMENT. EXCUSE ME. I WOULD RECOMMEND IF YOU GUYS ARE ARE CERTAINLY OBVIOUSLY LOOKING INTO IT BUT I HAVE TOLD THIS TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND OTHER DECISION MAKERS ACROSS THE STATES THAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT SPORTS WAGERING YOU SHOULD COME TO LET THE BATTER TOUR SOME OF THE OPERATIONS LOOK AT THE REGULATIONS AND THE RULES THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR JUST OVER FORTY YEARS AND THE STATE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT. WOULD GIVE YOU A JUMPSTART OF WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MARK THANK YOU VERY IMPORTANT FIELD TRIP FOR. ALL OF US. YES IT IS I WILL PERSONALLY TO ARE YOU AROUND IF YOU COME OUT TO IN THE STATE OF THAT. OKAY THANK YOU. CHRIS NELSON YES- AGAIN I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE MY NAME'S MARK NELSON I'M THE CORPORATE DIRECTOR OF RACING SPORTS FOR MONARCH GAMING WE ON WE OPERATE. CASINOS IN IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS WE HAVE A PROPERTY IN RENO NEVADA AS WELL AS- IN COLORADO BLACK **** WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO. HELP WITH IT DRAFTING. RULES AND REGULATIONS IN COLORADO. AND I'M REALLY HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS I DON'T HAVE A FORMAL PRESENTATION BUT I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WILL CERTAINLY- TAKE YOU UP ON THAT- AT THIS TIME. WILL MOVE TO THE- FINAL THE TESTIMONY OF THIS PANEL- THAT SHALL BE WITH OR LOTTERY WELCOME. CULTURE GRAY CULTURE DODD MEMBERS FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS MATT SHALL BE IN THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER AT THE OREGON LOTTERY AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE. A LITTLE BIT. OF LEARNING THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE LAST- TWO AND A HALF MONTHS SINCE WE LAUNCHED OUR MOBILE- SPORTS PLATFORM- OREGON LOTTERY SCOREBOARD- A LOT OF IT- ALL KIND OF BREEZED THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF THE BEGINNING STUFF BECAUSE- A LOT OF THE FOLKS HAVE COME BEFORE ME OF TOUCH ON IT. I IN TERMS OF- WHAT PEOPLE WHO KIND OF THE GENERAL STATS IN THE NATIONAL- APPETITE FOR SPORTS BETTING. BUT ORIGINS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT- I THINK THE CALIFORNIA WELL IN A LOT OF WAYS BUT- YOU KNOW OUR LEGAL FRAMEWORK IS ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT AND WHEN VOTERS BACK IN THE MID EIGHTIES ENACTED. THE LOTTERY THEY ESTABLISHED OF A LOTTERY COMMISSION THAT'S A BIPARTISAN COMMISSION THAT CAN AUTHORIZE ANY GAME OF CHANCE THAT INCLUDES SPORTS BETTING. AND SO THE COMMISSION. APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AUTHORIZE ARE CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE THEY HIRED DIRECTOR WHO ACTUALLY OVERSEAS THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THE LOTTERY. THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE REALLY IS TO- WERE WITHIN CONTRACTUAL VOTER SPEND THE MONEY THAT WE BRING IN- ALSO- BEYOND CONFIRMING COMMISSIONERS. OVER THE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE IN OREGON HAS ENACTED STATUTES THAT REGULATE MORE OR LESS HOW WE DO THINGS. NOT NECESSARILY WHAT AND A GREAT EXAMPLE IS- THAT LIMITING THE NUMBER OF VIDEO LOTTERY TERMINALS PER- PER LOTTERY RETAILER IN IN THE STATE. SO WHAT THAT HAS DONE IS WIN PASSED BUT WAS OVERTURNED- WE WERE ABLE TO PAVE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE QUICKLY- THAN SOME OTHER STATES BECAUE WE DIDN'T HAVE TO- SEEK A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OR- OR REALLY EVEN LEGISLATION. OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T OPERATE IN A VACUUM AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING- IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR LEGISLATURE FOR SOMETIME NOW- BUT IT DID SPEED THINGS ALONG. LOTTERY HAD A SPORTS GAME- I THINK STARTED IN THE LATE EIGHTIES- THROUGH THE- THROUGH THE NINETIES INTO THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. IT WAS A- VERY BASIC PARLAY GAME THAT WAS AVAILABLE CONVENIENCE STORES IN OREGON WE HAVE THAT ONE PASS BUT WAS FIRST ENACTED. IN SO THAT'S WHY OREGON- WAS GRANDFATHERED IN THAT SAID. OUR COMMISSION- VOTED TO END THAT- THAT PARLAY GAME IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS PRIMARILY DUE TO PRESSURE FROM THE NC DOUBLE A- STATING THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO AUTHORIZE ANY- CHAMPIONSHIP EVENTS IN THE STATE THAT HAD. ANY FORMER SPORTS BETTING- UNIVERSITY OF OREGON WHERE TRACK CHAMPIONSHIPS AT HAYWARD- AS SHE WAS DOING GREAT WITH BASEBALL- WE WANTED TO FILL- THE MOTOR CENTER WITH A MARCH MADNESS GAMES SO- YOU KNOW OR LEGISLATOR WITH LEGISLATURE LOOK AT THAT WEIGHING REALLY THAT. THE REVENUE THAT THAT PARTICULAR GAME WAS BRING IN WITH THE POTENTIAL LOSSES OF THOSE GAMES AND WE MADE THAT DECISION OBVIOUSLY THE WORLD HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN- AND- AND SO WE DECIDED TO BRING IT BACK BUT JUST BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO SOMETHING- IT DOESN'T MEAN WE NECESSARILY SHOWED SO WE REALLY TOOK A STEP BACK. AND REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT'S THE BUSINESS CASE- TO DO THIS AND A LOT OF THIS. YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY. ABOUT THE TRENDS- BOTH IN GAMBLING IN GENERAL BUT ALSO- IN RELATION TO MOBILE- WHAT THE CONVENIENCE EXPECTATIONS ARE. FOR US WHEN WE LOOKED AT IT. WE OFFER- PRIOR TO SPORTS BETTING WE OFFER- DRAW GAMES SCRATCH TICKETS VIDEO LOTTERY SO- GAMES THAT APPEAL TO A CERTAIN SUBSET OF OUR POPULATION. BUT NOT ALL AND SO WHEN WE LOOKED AT- SPORTS BETTING AND REALLY WHO THAT APPEAL TO ITS THEY TEND TO BE YOUNGER- TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER INCOME- LIKE THE ELEMENT OF SKILL. AND FRANKLY WE JUST AN OFFER THOSE TYPES OF GAMES IN OUR PORTFOLIO AND SO WE WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS. WE THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT WAY TO EXPAND THE PORTFOLIO AND REALLY- INCREMENTALLY RAISE REVENUE WITHOUT ASKING OUR CURRENT PLAYERS TO PLAYER WHICH ARE MORE. SO REALLY KIND OF EXPAND THAT PILE OF TOTAL PLAYERS. AGAIN IT'S THAT INCREMENTAL SALE IT IS A NEW LEVEL OF EXCITEMENT- AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WAS OVERTURNED WE WERE GETTING CALLS AND EMAILS ABOUT WINNER WHEN YOU GET A BRING BACK SPORTS ACTION THAT WAS THE OLD GAME THAT WE USED TO HAVE AND- JUST DALY. A CALL SO WE KNEW THERE WAS A LOT OF EXCITEMENT WE KNEW THAT ILLEGAL BETTING ON A MOBILE PLATFORMS WAS ALREADY OCCURRING- IN IN THE STATE AND SO THAT'S WHY WE MADE THE DECISION TO GO FORWARD- SO ORGAN LOTTERY SCOREBOARD- WE LAUNCHED IN MID OCTOBER- THERE WERE SOME POLICY CHOICES THAT WE- THAT ARE COMMISSION MADE- THAT I THINK ANYONE'S GONNA HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH WE MADE THE CHOICE TO. LIMIT IT TO AGES TO PLAYERS- TWENTY ONE AND OLDER- FOR US- IT'S THE FIRST FORAY INTO ACCOUNT BASED PLAY THROUGH THE MOBILE PLATFORM SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS FOR THE FIRST TIME WE REALLY KNOW WHO'S PLAYING OUR GAMES- WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW WHO WINS OUR GAMES WHEN THEY COME IN- FOR THE LARGE TAXABLE PRICES WHEN THEY CASH THEM BUT NOW WE HAVE INSIGHT INTO- A PLAYER'S ENTIRE PLAYER HISTORY- THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY BENEFICIAL FOR SOME RESPONSIBLE GAMING AND GAMBLING A PROBLEM GAMBLING- ISSUES WE CAN ACTUALLY SPOT- HIGH RISK PLAYERS- BUT ALSO. IT POSE SOME REAL- POLICY- DISCUSSIONS FORCED TO JUST AROUND A PUBLIC RECORDS AND IS THAT DATA AVAILABLE WE'RE A PUBLIC AGENCY WE HAVE THIS DATA- WE DON'T THINK THAT AN INDIVIDUAL'S PROPER HISTORY IS PUBLIC DATA ARE RELEASABLE DATE OBVIOUSLY TAX BILL WTH SPRINT STORY BUT- YEAH SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE- TO. ABOUT. IT'S MORE SO YOU KEEP IT IN THE STATE OF OREGON HOW DO YOU GUARANTEE THAT THE PLAYERS. I SITTING IN- THEIR LIVING ROOMS IN SACRAMENTO PLAYING OREGON LOTTERY GAME WELL AS BECAUSE WE- HAVE THE GEO FENCE THE APPS S. WHEN YOU LOG INTO THE APP WHEN YOU PLACE THE WAGER IT BRINGS YOUR CELL PHONE- IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE STATE OF OREGON- IT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO PUT THAT- THAT BATHROOM. YOU CAN ACTUALLY CREATE ACCOUNT ANYWHERE BUT YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE STATE OF OREGON- THERE TO ACTUALLY PLACE THAT WAGER. WE ALSO MADE THE POLICY CHOICES LIMIT OUR OFFERINGS TO PROFESSIONAL SPORTS. WE KNOW WE'RE LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE- WE MADE THAT DECISION- PRIMARILY AS A WAY TO. REALLY IMPACT OUR SPEED TO MARKET- WE KNOW THAT BEFORE. WE OFFER NC DOUBLE A BETTING. WE HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM- THERE'S PROBABLY MORE ENGAGING WITH OUR LEGISLATURE WE KNOW WE DON'T OCCUR OPERATE IN A VACUUM- UNLIKE CALIFORNIA. OREGON DOESN'T HAVE A TON OF PROFESSIONAL SPORTS- AND OUR CAN OF MAJOR UNIVERSITIES- FOR LARGE SEGMENTS THE PARK IT POPULATION ARE KIND OF THE DE FACTO PRO SPORTS AND- AND WE KNOW THAT AND WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT AND SO WE ARE. CONTINUING TO LOOK AT WAYS TO. BRING IT ON- BUT WE'RE WE'RE JUST NOT THERE YET MORE CONVERSATIONS NEED TO TAKE PLACE- BUT WE ALSO WENT WITH A FULL RANGE OF WAGERING OPTIONS YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THE ILLEGAL OUR OFFSHORE MARKETS OFFER A WIDER. VARIETY OF A OF TYPES OF BETTING AND WE WANTED TO DO IT AS BEST WE COULD CAN AMIR THAT SAME EXPERIENCE- BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE ARE A PUBLIC ENTITY AND- WE HAVE THE OF THE PUBLIC GOOD CONSIDERATION AS WELL WE WANTED TO MAKE THAT THERE WERE A- WHOLE SUITE OF RISK. GIVING WAS BUILT IN TO OUR PLATFORM WHEN WE LAUNCHED. SO WAT WERE SOME OF THOSE RESPONSE FOR WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE GAMING TOOLS- WE MADE THAT THAT AGAIN POLICY DECISION TO REQUIRE A DEPOSIT LIMIT. WHEN YOU SET UP YOUR ACCOUNT SO WHEN A PLAYER GOES IN YOUR IN YOUR SETTING UP YOUR ACCOUNT YOU HAVE TO PUT A NUMBER AND THEY CHOOSE THAT NUMBER IS EVERYONE'S SITUATION IS DIFFERENT BUT WE'RE MAKE WHERE YOU HAVE TO KIND OF TAKE A MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT- JUST WHAT THAT LIMIT IT. IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE THE WOMEN ARE WAITING PERIODS BUILT AND IT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU JUST IMMEDIATELY DO THAT OVER AND OVER- WE FEEL PLAYERS ON THE MOBILE APP THAT HAVE ACCESS EASY ACCESS TO THEIR ACCOUNT THREE MAKE BETTER DECISIONS- I LIKE TO- LOOK AT THAT MY WIFE I HAVE OUR PHONES- IT TRACKS ALL THE- MONEY THAT. WE SPEND OUR BOOKS SENATE MADE FOR. IN CONVERSATION. IT ALSO IS NOT MANDATE BUT IT'S ALL IT IT'S IT IS OPTION PLAYERS CAN SET LOS AND BENT LIMITS- SO BEYOND THEIR DEPOSIT LIMIT IF THEY CAN SET A LOS LIMIT SO THAT IF THEY GET TO A PLACE WHERE THEY'VE LOST EX NUMBER OF DOLLARS A MONTH IT TIMES THEM OUT AGAIN THAT'S AN OPTIONAL FEATURE BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS A TOOL THAT WAS AVAILABLE- ANOTHER ONE IS A SELF SELF SELF ASSESSMENT QUIZ. THAT PLAYERS CAN TAKE AGAIN MOBILE PHONE VERY EASY TO DO- AND AGAIN THIS KIND OF THE TREND YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS THAT WE FEEL LIKE THE PLAYERS THAT MORE INFORMED PLAYERS MAKE BETTER MORE RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS AND SO REALLY THOSE FOR THOSE FIRST FEW BULLETS ARE ALL ABOUT GIVING PLAYERS AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WE CAN. WE ALSO KNOW THAT EVEN WITH ALL THOSE TOOLS IT MIGHT BE TOO MUCH FOR SOME PEOPLE AND WE OFFER A VOLUNTARY TIMEOUTS WHICH ARE JUST JUST THAT IT'S A TIME OUT IT COULD BE FOR A DAY A WEEK UP TO A MONTH. TO A MONTH BEYOND A MONTH YOU START GETTING INTO WHAT WE CALL SELF EXCLUSION AND SELF EXCLUSION CAN UP CAN BE UP FOR EVER IF YOU GET TO A PLACE WHERE AS A PLAYER YOU FEEL LIKE YOU JUST CAN'T HANDLE HAVING ACCESS TO THIS CAN TURN IT OFF IT'S NOT. BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH BUT YOUR LAST OF KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER. JENNIFER I COME TO THIS EACH- I CAN'T TYPE THE CIVIC SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND BANK ACCOUNT SO IT'S NOT AS IF YOU CAN SELF EXCLUDE YOURSELF AND THEN A MONTH LATER DECIDE TO AND SIGN UP WITH A DIFFERENT EMAIL ADDRESS IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THAT EASY. SO AS I MENTIONED I KNOW HOW I'LL PREFACE THIS HOLD ON TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. I'LL PREFACE THIS BY SAYING ORGANS A LOT SMALLER THAN CALIFORNIA RIGHT OUR MARKET IS UP. IT IS MUCH MUCH DIFFERENT- WE'RE NOT NEW JERSEY WE DON'T HAVE NEW YORK'S CITY NEXT DOOR BUT IN- YOU KNOW SINCE MID OCTOBER TILL THE END OF THE YEAR- PLAYERS IN OREGON HAVE PLACED ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BATS- AND THAT'S OVER ABOUT A YOU KNOW EIGHT WEEK PERIOD OR SO- THE AVERAGE BET. IS NOT HUGE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. FORTY TWO THOUSAND REGISTRATIONS WE SAW AN IMMEDIATE SPIKE WE SUB THIRTY THOUSAND REGISTRATIONS IN THE FIRST THREE WEEKS- IS LET'S PLATEAUED OUT A LITTLE BIT SINCE THEN- BUT OUR THREE MONTH SCHOOL YOU CAN SEE KIND OF IN THE IN THE GREAT OUT. OF WAS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SIX MONTH THE SIXTY SIXTY SO WE'RE WELL ON TRACK- TO HIT OUR OUR REGISTRATION GOALS. BECAUSE WE ARE THE OPERATOR- IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT REVENUE STRUCTURE BECAUSE WE- THAT THAT GROSS GAMING REVENUE WE GET A CUT OF IT'S NOT A TAX. PER SE IT'S OUR PROFIT AT THE END OF THE DAY SO. BUT THER'S ALSO JUST STATE TAX ON PRICES SO YOU WHEN. YOU GET A TEN NINETY NINE AND. THAT'S CONTRIBUTED- TO- ACTUALLY MORE THAN NOW- BY NOW HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I AM BECAUSE IT'S MOBILE- AND BECAUSE IT'S ALL DIGITAL- PAY. THOSE THOSE WITH HOLDINGS ARE OFF THE TOP A MEDIA. WE ALSO CHECK FOR- AND WITHHOLD FOR- PAST CHILD SUPPORT AND- DHS OVERPAYMENT SO AGAIN ALL THAT HAPPENS IN REAL TIME BECAUSE IT'S ALL- ALL ONLINE. THESE ARE PROJECTIONS FOR THREE YEARS YOU'VE HEARD IT- FOLKS SAY THAT IT'S A IT'S A FAIRLY SMALL MARGIN BUSINESS. THE BIG NUMBERS YOU HEAR OR READ USUALLY ABOUT THE HANDLE MOST OF THAT GOES BACK TO PLAYERS IN THE FORMER WINNINGS BECAUSE OF IT DIDN'T THEY WOULDN'T PLAY- SO- IN THIS FIRST YEAR E ANTICIPATE PLAYERS IN OREGON SPENDING A LITTLE BIT OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. YOU TRACK IT ALL THE WAY TO. THE RIGHT THERE AND WE ANTICIPATE OUR PROFIT ON THAT BEING ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SO AGAIN. NOT HUGE REVENUE BUT- BUT REAL DOLLARS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN MILLION. UP TO PUT THAT INTO SOME PERSPECTIVE FOR YOU IN TERMS OF. OTHER GAMES THAT WE OFFER- IN TOTAL LAST YEAR. LOTTERY RETURNED A LITTLE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO AGAIN THIS A PRETTY SMALL SLICE OF OUR OVERALL PIE. BUT IT DOES EXPAND OUR BASE AND ALLOW FOR SOME INCREMENTAL GROWTH. AS I MENTIONED WE LAUNCHED LAST FALL- TWENTY TWENTY IS ALL ABOUT HI THE RETAILER STRATEGY SO WHERE AGAIN IT WILL BE UNIQUE IN THAT WE WITH MOBILE FIRST. AND NOW WE'RE COMING BACK AND ENGAGING- ON THAT THAT RETAIL BUSINESS PLAN. IT WILL LIKELY- INCLUDE SOME OF WORKS FORMA KIOSKS. BUT I'M I'M NOT GONNA CALL THE KIOSK STRATEGY REALLY IS A RETAILER BUSINESS STRATEGY THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES- TO BRING IN OUR RETAILERS. BOTH ON- THE SPORTS BETTING BUT ALSO JUST THE OTHER STUFF THAT COMES WITH IT SO. NOT EVERYBODY THAT WATCHES SPORTS BETS ON SPORTS BUT EVERYBODY THAT BETS ON SPORTS WATCHES. AND SO THERE ARE SOME REAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR EXISTING LOTTERY RETAILERS ESPECIALLY OR VIDEO LOTTERY RETAILERS. ARE FOR THE MOST PART TAVERNS IN RESTAURANTS AND BARS IN OREGON. SOME OF THE KEY LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED IN THE LAST HOW I'D SAY NINE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THIS- YOU THAT YOUR AS AGAIN AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THE BLACK MARKET HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE- PAR BIGGEST COMPETITION- THERE ARE JUST SOME. SOME THINGS THAT THEY CAN OFFER THAT THAT WE CAN'T. BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN OFFER THAT THEY CANNOT. OF PEOPLE LIKE THE FACT. THAT WHEN THERE'S AN ISSUE IF THERE'S AN ISSUE. THERE TALKING TO A REAL PERSON THERE'S AN OFFICE IN SALEM THEY CAN DRIVE DOWN TO- THEY KNOW THAT. THEY WHEN THEY GET PAID THEY DON'T GET PAID A BIT COIN THEY GET PAID IN REAL DOLLARS THAT GO BACK INTO THEIR ACCOUNT. IT'S MUCH MORE OF MORE THERE'S MUCH LESS FRICTION IN THAT FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HER. HERE. IS ARE. PEOPLE FEEL BETTER ABOUT SUPPORTING FRANKLY- IN OREGON LOTTERY SUPPORTS A NUMBER OF- BENEFICIARIES THE VOTERS OVER THE YEARS HAVE HAVE APPROVED- AND PEOPLE KNOW THAT. EVEN IF THEY DON'T WIN. THE BET. ORIGIN IS WINNING BECAUSE OREGON IS THE HOUSE WE ARE THE OPERATOR THAT MONEY ULTIMATELY FLOWS TO- SCHOOLS AND PARKS AND- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OTHER THINGS- AND AGAIN SOME OF THE THINGS. THAT WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY THINK ABOUT THAT WE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY. THERE ARE OTHER RULES AND THINGS IN THAT MAY TRIP YOU UP THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT ONE OF THE ONES THAT WAS HUGE FOR US. WAS THAT BANKING LAWS IN OREGON PREVENTED US FROM HOPING. PEOPLE'S MONEY IN TRUST. IF WE WERE A PRIVATE OPERATOR IF WE JUST GIVE SOMEONE A LICENSE. THERE AN OPERATOR SOMEONE SENSIBLE PLAYER ACCOUNT. YOU DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY THE OPERATOR CAN HOLD IT. WE CAN'T- SO WE HAD TO FIND A- OF WORK WITH OUR VENDOR TO KIND OF PUT TOGETHER A FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK. THAT HAD A FINANCIAL PARTNER SO THAT THERE THE PLAYER MONEY SITTING IN AN FDIC. INSURED ACCOUNT. OF THAT WE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO SO THAT WAS- THAT WAS WHEN THEY CAN ADDED TO THE COMPLEXITY- SOME OF OUR- TAX RULES. ARE PROVING A LITTLE BIT- HAVE PROVED A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING NOT TO GET TOO FAR INTO THE WEEDS BUT- THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WIN IS A- WIN IS A WIN A WIN AND IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE BATS ARE ALL THOSE BETS INDIVIDUAL TAX EVENTS. THAT HAVE TO BE- WHERE YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY WITH OUR- PROACTIVELY WITH HOLD EACH ONE OF THOSE- CAN YOU KIND OF BUNDLE- WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT AS WE SPEAK- TO KIND OF INPUT. AT THAT USER EXPERIENCE- I THINK IT'S ONE FOR OUR COMMISSION AND OUR LEGISLATURE AND US IN GENERAL. IS THAT IT'S NOT LIKE A REGULAR LOTTERY GAME IT'S NOT A GUARANTEED RETURN WITH VIDEO LOTTERY WE KNOW THE RETURN THE PLAYER. THE LOTTERY GAME IS ABOUT THREE CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. OVER YOU KNOW MILLIONS OF SPENCE. SPORTS BETTING IF WE ARE IN A FAR TRADERS. DON'T DON'T DO IT RIGHT WE CAN WE CAN HAVE A PRETTY BAD WEEKEND RIGHT AND YOU HEAR THAT. AND SO- THAT'S A- IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WE HAD TO KIND OF A FOUNDATIONAL WORK THAT WE HAD TO DO. AROUND SETTING EXPECTATIONS- NOT TO GET TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW ON A DAY OR A WEEKEND IT'S REALLY MORE ABOUT THE TRENDS- AND OVERALL THE TRENDS ARE LOOKING GOOD. BUT THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE DEFINITELY YEAH THERE ARE SPIKES. OF PEACE IN VALLEY. AVENUE OF OVERTIME- FOR US HOME TEAM BIAS IS A REAL THING WHEN THE BLAZERS WHEN WE DO POORLY- WHEN THE WAR YEARS WHEN WE DO GREAT-WHICH- IS TOUGH THIS YEAR- BUT SORRY- BUT AGAIN ALL RIGHT. IT ALSO OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CURRENT SPORTS SPONSORSHIPS. ARE REALLY CHANGE WE'VE BEEN A LONG TIME SPONSOR. OF THE TRAILBLAZERS OF THE TIMBERS ARE MLS TEAM- BUT WHEN YOUR A SPONSOR SELLING. POWER BALL AND SCRATCH TICKETS IN VIDEO LOTTERY THAT'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SPONSORSHIP THE WHEN YOU'RE A SPONSOR- SELLING A GAMBLING PRODUCT THAT'S THAT IS OCCURRING IN THE ARENA ON THAT TEAM AND SO- IT IT OFFERS SOME OTHER OPPORTUNITIES- CAN ACTUALLY FOR US GIVE. GIVES US SOME GREAT INSIGHT. WORKING WITH SEASON TICKET HOLDERS AND DIFFERENT THINGS- AROUND THAT SO JUST ONE THING TO THE THAT WE CAN I'VE- LEARNED ALONG THE WAY. AND FINALLY YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR HAVE YOU HEARD EVERY MODEL HAS PROS AND CONS- WERE A SINGLE STATE OPERATED SPORTS BURKE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TRIBAL CASINOS WERE THE ONLY MOBILE GAME IN TOWN. IN THE STATE OF OREGON- YOU KNOW FOR US BUT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR PLAYERS IT'S GOOD FOR THE INTEGRITY- LOTTERIES A TRUSTED BRAND ALREADY- AND PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE- YOU KNOW DEPOSITING THEIR MONEY INTO AN ACCOUNT THAT'S GOT OUR LOGO ON IT- AND- YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING IS THAT ALL ABOUT PROFIT. GOES BACK TO PUBLIC PROGRAMS. AND I THINK THE KEY ONE FOR US IS THAT OUR GOVERNANCE MODEL ALLOWS US TO OPERATE MUCH MORE LIKE A BUSINESS OBVIOUSLY WE'RE A PUBLIC AGENCY- AND WE DO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS BUT OF THE COMMISSION STRUCTURE THE BROAD- RULE MAKING AUTHORITY THAT THAT THAT COMMISSION HASHAS ALLOWED US TO. GET OUT OF THE GATE A LITTLE BIT FASTER THAN SOME OTHERS BUT- SOME OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES ALONG THE WAY THAT WE'VE RUN INTO ARE YOU COMMERCE IS OUR FIRST FORAY INTO SELLING SOMETHING ONLINE. SO BEYOND ESTABLISHING A SPORTS BUT WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ACTUALLY GET PAID AND HAVE THAT SYSTEM LINK UP TO OUR EXISTING. CLAIMS AND PAYMENTS AND TAXATION- SYSTEMS- THEIR JUST ACQUIRED YOU SPOKE TO ME ABOUT THE REGULATIONS ABOUT HOLDING MONEY VENDOR MANAGEMENT. WE ARE NOT- SPORTS BETTING EXPERTS SO WE HAVE TO RELY ON THOSE THAT ARE- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS THAT WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY. ON VENDOR COSTS- IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OVER TIME YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN BRING IN HOUSE BUT RIGHT NOW- WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF OUR GROWTH OF THAT GROSS GAMING REVENUE. ON ON MANAGED SERVICE- AND WITH THAT I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ATTEMPTING A FEW QUESTIONS THAT. THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR ANY THOUGHTS OR QUESTIONS WHICH GALLERY OR KICK IT OFF. YEAH MAYBE QUICKLY FROM EACH OF YOU YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT PROTECTIONS DO YOU PUT IN PLACE- TO ENSURE THAT THERE ISN'T MANIPULATIONS OF SPORT SPORTING GAMES BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF THE IMPETUS BEHIND THIS WAS THE CONCERN OVER. APPLE SHAVING POINTS- YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT. THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME COULD BE MANIPULATED. BENEFIT AND ARGUABLY OF COURSE SECOND HAPPEN ON THE BLACK MARKET TO WE KNOW THAT HAS HAPPENED. BUT YOU KNOW THAT TEMPTATION IS STILL GOING TO BE THERE IS MONEY AT STAKE AND NOW IT'S EVEN MORE WIDESPREAD. POTENTIALLY WHAT DO YOU GUYS PUT IN PLACE TO HELP ME A REGULATED ENSURE THAT THINGS LIKE THAT AREN'T HAPPENING TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE SPORTING GAMES. YEAH I CAN START- EIGHT AND YOU'RE RIGHT PRIMARILY IF THERE'S MATCH FICTION OR OR OR- POINT SHAVING CAN HAPPEN IN THE IN THE BLACK LEGAL MARKET BECAUSE THERE IT'S GONNA GO UNDETECTED IF THE ILLEGAL BOOKMAKER FINDS- SOME IN A MESS HE'S NOT REALLY GONNA GO TO THE YOU KNOW THE FBI AND REPORTED. RIGHT HE'S PROBABLY TO KEEP A SECRET- AND JUST YOU KNOW KIND OF GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS BUT YOU KNOW ON ON THE ISSUE OF INTEGRITY THE GAME WERE PRECISELY ALIGNED WITH SPORTS LEAGUES. AND COST IS NOW WE WANT TO WE WANT A FAIR CONTEST RIGHT AND SO- AS AS AS LICENSE AND REGULATE OPERATORS IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. OUR FIRST RESPONSIBILITY WHEN WE SEE SOME IN MRS REPORTED TO OUR REGULATOR SO NEVADA THAT'S IN CONTROL BOARD. JURORS THAT THE DG- AND SO WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION AS A LICENSEE REPORT ANY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY- IN THAT REGARD- IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE AN INTO A COUPLE OF CREDENCE WITH PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LEAGUE- WE HAVE A- AGREEMENT WITH THE NBA AND THE NHL. AND SO THERE AND SO IF THERE IS- THERE ARE. A MODERATE PROVISIONS KNOWS AGREEMENTS. WILL SHARE INFORMATION- SHOULD BE FIND ANYTHING AMISS- AND YOU KNOW PERCENT ALIGN WITH THEM IN THAT REGARD THAT THERE'S ANY. SORT OF ACTIVITY THAT WE FIND TO EASE TENSIONS- IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HAVE A TO REPORT. IT'S. ROCKETS THE CHANCE OF HAPPENING. NO COST WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW. POINT SHAVING MONEY LAUNDERING IN WHATEVER IT IS GO THROUGH OUR SYSTEM AND SO THE FIRST. YOU KNOW THAT THE FIRST RESPONSIBILITIES TO OUR REGULATOR AND THEN TWO AND THEN THAT REGULATOR WILL DO WITH THE INFORMATION WHAT THEY THINK IS APPROPRIATE OFTEN A LAW ENFORCEMENT- SPORTS LEASE OR WHATEVER THAT THE NEXT APPROPRIATE MEASURE MIGHT BE. I'LL ADD TO THAT AND. WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME CONTROL CONTROL MEASURES IN PLACE AT THE BOOK AND- DANS EXACTLY RIGHT WE LOOK FOR ANY TYPE OF YOU KNOW SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. AND E WILL REPORT TO OUR REGULATORS BUT- THERE I THINK THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION OUT THERE THAT. VEGAS IS STILL LIKE HOLLYWOOD NEED OR WERE YOU YOU HAVE A KNOWN PLAYERS THAT WILL COME UP WITH A SUITCASE OF MONEY IN A- TANK UP TO THEIR RESEARCH SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THAT WE WOULD ACCEPT THIS TYPE OF WAGES AND WE REALLY DON'T WITHOUT. KNOWING THE PLAYER. THOSE TYPE OF TRANSACTIONS REALLY JUST DON'T TAKE PLACE. THE PLAYERS THAT TO PLACE A BET IN LAS VEGAS. NORMALLY WILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF PLAYERS CARD OR SHOW ID IF THEY PLAYED ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT A LOT OF TIMES IT IN AND CERTAIN SPORTS BOOKS CAN BE AS LOW AS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS- OURS IS IT DEPENDING ON THE SPORT A. B. WHAT IF THE- PATIENT COMES IN INVEST OVER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR A THOUSAND DOLLARS- WE WILL ASK FOR THEM FOR THEIR ID OR TO GET A PLAYER'S CARDS SO WE CAN TRACK. THAT TYPE OF ACTION. IS THERE ARE A FEW CONTROL MEASURES THAT ARE IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE HOUSE AND AS DANCE AND WE ARE IN THE SAME BOAT AS THE LEAKS YOU KNOW WE- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE GAMES ARE FAIR AND TRUE. AND PLEASED. WE DON'T WANT TO BE ACCEPTING WAGERS ON ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE CROOKED. THIS GUY WOULD YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM ALL FOUR. BUT MAYBE JUST ONE OF THE STATE YOU KNOW THE- MAY FOR THE LOTTERY MAYBE YOU COULD SPEAK TO THIS OF IT BECAUSE I GET THAT LIKE. REPORTING TO REGULATOR. AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT. YOU FOLKS IN YOUR BUSINESS AND WOULD DO ANYTHING BUT- WHO REGULATES. THE REGULATED TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING. AND I THINK MORE SO THE CONNECTION TO THE ACTUAL GAME ITSELF LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT LOG IN ITS ALL LEGIT THERE'S NOTHING SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THE BET. IN ITSELF. THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE WITH THAT BET IS SOMEONE SOMEHOW MANIPULATING THE GAME AND WHAT PROTECTIONS HELP STOP. THAT FROM HAPPENING I GUESS YOU KNOW THIS KIND OF WORK ON. OKAY I'LL DEFERMORE TO THE OTHER FOLKS UP HERE AS I SAID WE ARE NOT. SPORTS BETTING EXPERTS WE HAVE A PRETTY BRIEF HISTORY WITH THIS BUT- I DO KNOW THAT A COUPLE OF THINGS WITH OURS- THE WAGERS ARE ABSOLUTELY KNOWN SO AS A WAGERS PLACED- BECAUSE IT'S ELECTRONIC TO OUR SYSTEM WE KNOW WHO'S PLACING THOSE WAGERS AND WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE WAGED. ON SO IF. THERE WAS A KNOWN MATCH FIX YOU WOULD SEE. WE'RE BETTING PATTERNS THAT SHOULDN'T BE OCCURRING AND THOSE BETTING PATTERNS THOSE BETS ARE ARE ARE ACTIVELY BEING MONITORED BOTH BY OUR TRADERS FROM A RISK PERSPECTIVE FOR THE BOOK BUT ALSO- OREGON LOTTERY- PARTNERS WITH OREGON STATE POLICE AND- WE HAVE- WORRY LOTTERY AND IT WAS P. OFFICERS THAT ARE MONITORING THOSE TIMES THE THAT TYPE OF STE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY AS WELL. AND AGAIN THERE'S ELECTRONIC LOG OF ALL OF THAT SO- YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS SOMETHING WHERE- YOU KNOW THE WORD GOT OUT THAT THAT SOMETHING SPECIAL OR MAYBE NOT SO SPECIAL WAS GONNA HAPPEN- YOU WOULD SEE THE BAT SCUTTLED STOCK UP ON ONE SIDE OF THAT AND BECAUSE WE ARE A- PUBLIC. REGULATED ENVIRONMENT THAT THERE'S TRANSPARENCY THERE AS OPPOSED TO A BLACK MARKET BOOK FOR YOU YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THAT LITTLE TRANSFERRED TO SAY THAT TRANSPARENCY. TO EVEN SEE THAT. I'M A FOLLOW UP ON MISTER GALLERIES QUESTION ASK INSIDE A DIFFERENT WAY. IS IT THE OPINION OF ANYONE ON THIS PANEL. THAT A BLACK MARKET HAS LESS. ILLEGAL ACTIVITY POINT SHAVING THAN A LEGAL REGULATED MARKET THAT'S ONLINE. THAT'S A NO NO SEVERAL ACTUALLY NOT ONLINE REGULATED MARKET PLACE HAS LAST. BAD ACTIVITY OCCURRING THAT'S A 100% CORRECT. WELL PEOPLE THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE OKAY. SO. PURSUING SOMETHING- WAS THE OBVIOUS BEST CHOICE THERE THE ONLY IF I COULD JUST ADD QUICKLY THE ONLY POINT SHAVING SCANDALS OF EVER BEEN UNCOVERED OR AND COVERED BY LICENSED REGULATED SPORTS BOOKS IN NEVADA AND WHILE WE'RE ON THAT POINT. IF A STATE WERE PURSUING- LEGISLATION. THE PAIN OF ANYONE ON THIS PANEL THAT IT WOULD BE- IN THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC IN THE STATE TO PURSUE. A POLICY THAT DID NOT INCLUDE ONLINE. IT WAS BRICK AND MORTAR ONLY. NOW THANK GOD I MEAN FOR OREGON THAT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IF THE CHOICE IS OBVIOUS FOR US WE WATCH FIRST OF MOBILE. DANIEL I'D- ANSWER THAT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT I THINK THAT- YOU JUST BECAUSE IT IS A RETAIL SUPPORTS BEEN DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T. DO THE SAME MONITORING THAT YOU MIGHT TO- FOR FRONTLINE WAGERING THE DISCS OF COURSE MATCH THOSE WOULD YOU PURSUE A POLICY THAT HAD NO WHAT THEY HAD NO ONLINE THERE WAS BROKEN WATER ONLY. DO YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD. CREDIT GOOD MARKETPLACE HAVE GOOD- YOU KNOW INTEGRITY BE GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER WE WOULD. GENERALLY WE YOU KNOW WE DEFER TO OUR TO THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PEOPLE WE WORK WITH ON THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES. I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW- BENEFITS OF. RETAIL OR ONLINE I THINK THERE THERE'S BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES WITH BOTH OF THEM. AND BUT CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES TO INTEGRITY ISSUES- THERE'S NO- LESS- ABILITY TO MONITOR FOR TERRY ISSUES IN A RETAIL ENVIRONMENT THAN ONLINE. BY ANY STRETCH THANK YOU YEAH CHAIRMAN DOT. YEAH BUT SHALL BE YOU- YOU PUT THE NUMBERS UP. YOU KNOW UP THERE ABOUT- WHAT YOUR- TOTAL TAKE IS EVERYTHING YOU DON'T DO NC DOUBLE A- HAVE YOU DONE IT ANALYSIS. ON WHAT YOUR HANDLE WOULD BE IF YOU. WE'RE LEAVING ABOUT 50% OF THE TABLE RIGHT NOW THANK YOU. IT WAS A FOLLOW UP TO THAT QUESTION JUST SO WE'RE SURE EVERYONE ON THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS. THE STATE OF ORDER IS. KEEPING THE GROSS GAMING RAVENOUS RIGHT VERSES BENEFITING FROM A TAX ON GROSS CAM IS SO BOTH- THE SO THIS IS ACTUALLY PART OF THE BEST SLIDE TO THE KERR WALKS A PERSON THROUGH SO- THE FAR LEFT YOU HAVE HANDLE AND THESE ARE PROJECTIONS BECAUSE WERE LIKE I SAID WERE TWO AND A HALF MONTHS AND BUT- SO FAR THIS IS PANNING OUT FOR THE MOST PART. HANDLE WE ANTICIPATE A PLAYER'S OREGON WAGERING ABOUT A LITTLE OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION WINNING ABOUT LITTLE OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION SO THEY'RE GRASPING REVENUE TWENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION. NOW IT WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY TO PUT THIS CASE MONTHS SERVICES THROUGH- THROUGH TRADING AND OTHER THINGS. THE APP ITSELF THE PLATFORM BUT WE HAVE- SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT AND- THE OTHER KIND OF GEO FENCING AND- THE BANKING FEES AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS IN TERMS OF EXPENSES SO SOME FAIR OVERHEAD. TO OFFER THE GAME AND AT THE END OF THE DAY. I'M JUST HAVING A FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A PROFIT THAT THEN. AT ABOUT FIVE IN. SOME TO SOME CONTINGENCY FOR PRICE VOLATILITY BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I MEAN THAT STATE. ULTIMATELY THAT STATE MONEY- THE WINNINGS. THAT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY. IN WINNINGS WOULD BE TAXED. YOU KNOW IT INDIVIDUAL STATE INCOME TAX. IN THE CASE OF CALIFORNIA WE COULD SUBSTITUTE. YOU HAVE TWENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION IN GROSS CAM REVENUES THIS YEAR IN YEAR ONE- THE ESTIMATES PROVIDED IN THE EARLIER TESTIMONY I THINK WAS TWO AND A HALF BILLION GROSS GAMING REVENUES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AT A MATURE MARKET OBVIOUSLY NOT YOUR ONE. RIGHT. IT'S IN A POLICY CHOICE DIFFERENT THAN IF WE WERE TO TAKE- 10% TAX RATE OR 20% TAX RATE. ON THAT WOULD LOOK A WORKING CHORE FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAXES AT A MATURE MARKET VERSUS- WHATEVER PROFIT RATE WE CAN ACHIEVE OFFER THAT YOU'RE FIFTY NINE. YEAH I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A THAT'S A FAIR THAT'S A THAT'S A POLICY DISCUSSION RIGHT IS IT WHO'S GONNA- HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BRING SPORTS BETTING TO THE MARKET IS GOING TO BE A STATE RUN. IS A COMMUNITY LICENSED- AND IN IN THE RUN ARE PRIVATELY RUN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S- YOU KNOW WAS IN CONCERT IN IN IN EACH ONE OF THOSE MODELS. TAKE YOUR CASE A- WE WERE TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS VERSUS FOUR POINT NINE YES I VERSUS 20% TAX RATE YOU MIGHT BE GETTING AS MUCH AS AS YOUR- NETTING AT THE END OF THE DAY. YES AFTER YES IT'S FOR. OKAY DO WE HAVE ADDITIONAL. QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL. MISTER COOPER YEAH I JUST ABOUT SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT FOR THE JIM OF MORGAN- MOLES ACOSTA SETTING UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR YOUR SPORTS BETTING PROGRAM BOTH YOUR ONLINE COST IN YOUR BRICK AND MORTAR COST LOCATIONS SO BECAUSE WE HAVE A LARGE BRICK AND MORTAR YET THAT'S AND EASY ANSWER ZERO- BUT FOR THE ONLINE WE PARTNERED WITH A VENDOR PROVIDER. FOR THE ONLINE PLATFORM- AND SO THEY ACTUALLY- IT'S A REVENUE SHARE MODEL AND SO WE DID NOT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LOTTERY STAFF HOURS- WE DIDN'T SPEND MONEY LAUNCH THIS PRODUCT WE- THE VENDOR- INCUR THE COST. CUTTING OUT THE PLATFORM OF STAFFING THE- CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL CENTER- HIRING ALL THAT STUFF- THEY DID AND NOW THAT WE ARE ALIVE THEY ARE GETTING AND THAT'S PART OF THIS PRODUCT. EXPENSE THEY ARE GETTING A PERCENTAGE OF THAT GROSS GIVING REVENUE TO PAY BACK THE START UP COSTS EXACTLY AND THEN I DON'T THINK I STEPPED OUT SLOW IS MAY BEEN ANSWERED. SORRY TAX BOTH ON THE BEDDING AND ON THE WINNINGS TO. SO WE ARE NOT BECAUSE WE ARE A PUBLIC ENTITY SO THAT THAT WE- THAT WAS A QUESTION MARK AS WE STARTED THIS AROUND. THE FEDERAL EXCISE- QUESTION AND WE- DON'T HAVE THAT AND SO. OUR TAX. WILL CALL OUR TAX IS A LOTTERY ESSENTIALLY NOT PROFIT DOESN'T STICK WITH US IT GOES BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO PAY TO FUND PROGRAMS AT OREGON VOTERS HAVE APPROVED SO. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY OUR TAX IN GOING IN YOUR YOUR PRE ESTIMATES WHAT YOU GONNA US FAR AS A- TEXAS COMING FROM THAT YOU GUYS IF YOU KNOW YOUR MARKS. SO FAR WORK TWO AND A HALF MONTHS AND SO. WHERE IS THE REASON I ASK IS YOU KNOW WE DID LOTTERY HERE MONEY FOR SCHOOLS IT FELL SHORT CANNABIS TAX WE FELL SHORT SO. THAT'S JUST. A BILL TREPIDATION ABOUT THAT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TOOK GREAT. PAINS TO DO IN THE LAST OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WAS SET EXPECTATIONS WITH ART WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THIS REALLY. THAT THAT COLUMN ON THE LEFT SO PEOPLE GET REALLY EXCITED WHEN THEY SEE THOSE NUMBERS ON HANDLE AND WE WORK REALLY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT THAT RIGHT COLUMN TO. THAT LIKE IT IS A LOT OF MONEY BUT IF THE DAY. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A HUGE WE ARE NOT SEEING THIS IS A HUGE WILL FALL I THINK YOU WERE OUT WHEN I SEE- SO THIS YEAR ONE PROJECTION OF FIVE MILLION TOTAL PROFIT. FOR THE SPORTS- BEDDING PRODUCTS. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR WORKING LOTTERY LAST YEAR. WE HE GAVE THE OREGON LEGISLATURE SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS- BUT FOR ALL OF OUR GAMES. MOST ICE THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. BEFORE YOU GUYS WRAP UP ON. I'D LIKE TO HEAR ONCE PERSPECTIVE ON- IN GAME PLAY AND- I BELIEVE ORGAN IS ENGAGED IN THAT. AND HOW WE THINK- THE PROSPECTS OF THAT WOULD BE FOR CALIFORNIA. AS FAR AS A SUCCESSFUL MARKET BUT NOT SUCCESSFUL MARKET WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR OVERALL BOOK IS A REPRESENTS SESSION SURE SO IN TERMS OF THE HANDLE THE AMOUNT THAT FOR US IT'S ABOUT 40% IS BAD IN GAME OR AFTER THE START OF THE MATCH. BY 40% AND GROWING OF COURSE- PRIMARILY PRIMARILY A MOBILE- OFFERING- IT IS AVAILABLE IN RETAIL. ASKS PLUS OVER THE COUNTER BUT IT'S PRIMARILY- A MOBILE OFFERING BUT IT IS A HIGH GROWTH AREA- TOUGH FOR US IN EUROPE YOU MIGHT SEE AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR BUSINESS IN PLAY OVER 50% WELL OVER FIFTY PERCENT. SPECIAL ON SOME SPORTS LIKE TENNIS SOCCER- BUT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE BUSINESS AND FOR FOLKS LIKE MYSELF WHO WOULD NEVER WAGERS ON SPORTS- COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IN GAME PLAY IS. YEAH YEAH SURE SO. BROADLY IN PLAYS ANYTHING THAT AFTER THE START OF A GAME OR MATCH SO- YOU KNOW PRIMARILY WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING WITHIN IS THERE PAIN ON THE OUTCOME OF THE GAME. OR MATCH AT SOME POINT DURING THE GAME SO YOU KNOW I CAN JUMP IN IN THE SECOND HALF OF A- YOU KNOW. AMERICA IS GAME IN THEM TO COVER THE SPREAD. IF YOU'RE DOWN BY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POINTS RIGHT. ONE VERY POPULAR MATH THAT IS THE BEST A HIGHLY FAVORITE TEAM COME BACK WHEN THEY'VE- TRAILING EARLY IN THE GAME- BECAUSE YOU GET BETTER I. DO IT THAT WAY- AND SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY EARLY NOW WHAT PEOPLE DO- BASEBALL IS MOST POPULAR IN PLACE OR- BELIEVE. BECAUSE THE PACE THE GAME IS A LOTS OF STARTS AND STOPS DURING THE GAME. AND A VERY POPULAR THAT'S IN BASEBALL ARE YOU KNOW IS A RUN IN THE SCORE. IN THIS IN THE SECOND INNING YES OR NO SOMEBODY CAN PULL UP THE RIGHT. AND THAT THE YOU KNOW A BET ON THE GAME AT THAT POINT. YOU KNOW BASEBALL- TENNIS IS A VERY POPULAR IN PLACE SPORT BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO BAD FINITE- SETS SETS YOU CAN BET SAID BY SAT- POINT- GAME BY GAME YOU CAN THAT- WHAT PEOPLE ARE NOT GENERALLY BETTING IS YOU KNOW IS LEBRON JAMES AND HIT THIS THREE POINTER YES OR NO THINGS THAT ARE VERY VERY QUICK TO HAPPEN IN A GAME- BALL STRIKING BASEBALL IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS REALLY BEEN VERY POPULAR IN THE US SO FAR. BUT IT'S MORE AGAIN THE WELCOME FULL MATCH YOUR GAME IT. DURING THE GAME. I WOULD I WOULD JUST REINFORCE THAT OUTSIDE OF A THE MOBILE ATMOSPHERE IN GAME IS. THE AMOUNT OF HANDLE WOULD DROP DRASTICALLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE A MOBILE PRODUCT IF IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO IN YOUR HAND BECAUSE THERE'S JUST THERE'S NOT TIME THE ODDS CHANGE SO QUICKLY THAT BY THE TIME YOU LEAVE YOUR SEAT WALK UP TO THE COUNTER. THE ODDS OF CHANGED AND IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROPOSITION. AND WE'RE A PRETTY IMAGE COULD RIGHT WE'VE GOT. SINCE MID OCTOBER- IN OUR PLAYERS ARE LEARNING- THEY DIDN'T HAVE SPORTS BETTING BUT EVEN EVEN OUR NEW NOVICE FOR THE MOST PART SPORTS BETTING PLAYERSARE SPENDING IN IT SIGNIFICANT OTHER HANDLE ON IN GAME IT'S NOT 40% BUT IT'S GROWING- WE ANTICIPATE THAT YOU KNOW BY YOUR THREE WHEN PEOPLE GET A LITTLE MORE USED TO THE- THE PLATFORM- THAT IT WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT. COMPONENT. SUSAN SAID FORTY PERCENT OF THE HANDLE CURRENTLY. WHAT IS THE KIND OF PREDICTIONS GOING FORWARD A MOLE GAMING OBVIOUSLY IS NOT A BRAND NEW THING BUT IT'S A RELATIVELY RECENT THING- IF THAT'S CONTRIBUTED TO THE SUCCESS OF IN GAME BETTING WHAT ARE THE PROJECTIONS IN VEGAS AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY- WOULD THAT BE A GROWING COMPONENT. ARE WE GONNA STICK AROUND 40% YES IN EUROPE IS IT IS A LITTLE BIT NORTH OF 50% GENERALLY BEEN ON THE SPORT SO I MEAN I COULD SEE IT GOING. ON THE U. S. 50% OR HIGHER- PRE MATCH IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A POP WHAT WE CALL PRE MATCH BEFORE THE GAME IS ALWAYS GONNA POPULAR WAY OF THAT IN THE U. S. A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL WILL PARLAY MULTIPLE GAMES OR EVENTS TOGETHER. SO I THINK THAT IN PLAY ARE IN PLACE ALWAYS GOING TO BE- A GROWING PART OF THE BUSINESS BUT I DON'T SEE PRE MATCH IS BEING- YOU KNOW GETTING MUCH MUCH SMALLER. EITHER IN A QUESTION FOR MR CORRUGATED. COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THE NFL. SUPER CONTEST WHAT THAT IS- A MORE TO. HELP HOW POPULAR IS. WHAT THE PROJECTIONS ARE THAT CENTER. SURE WE HOST THE. THE NFL CONTEST CALLED THE SUPER CONTEST IT'S A HIGH END CONTEST IT'S FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR ENTRY FEE WHERE CONTESTANTS PICK FIVE GAMES AGAINST THIS SPREAD EACH AND EVERY WEEK DURING THE SEVENTEEN WEEK REGULAR SEASON IT'S BEEN. WE'VE BEEN RUNNING IT SINCE- NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT- WE'VE HAD. AND ESCAPE ESCALATED GROWTH OVER THE LAST- TEN YEARS AS WE WERE HOVERING AROUND- THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED ENTRIES EACH AND EVERY YEAR BUT OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS IT'S THAT SET THE NINE CONSECUTIVE RECORDS AS THIS PAST SEASON WE HAD THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT CONTESTANTS WITH THE WINNER RECEIVING ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. JUST UNDER ONE POINT FIVE WE PAID THE TOP ONE HUNDRED- AND- WE DON'T SEE IT SLOWING DOWN AT ANY TIME WE ACTUALLY ADDED A COUPLE OF OTHER NFL CONTESTS- SUPER CONTEST GOLD WHICH IS A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR ENTRY FEE. WINNER TAKE ALL AND THIS YEAR'S WINNER ONE JUST OVER FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND- WE ALSO HAVE A SUPER CONTEST REBOOT WHICH IS A MID SEASON CONTEST THAT STARTS AND WEEK NINE FOR THOSE THAT MAY BE MISSED OUT THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON OR MAYBE THEIR SEAT AND ISN'T GOING VERY WELL. TO YOU CAN YOU HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO ENTER A CONTEST THAT STARTS IN WEEK NINE AND RUNS THROUGH WEEK SEVENTEEN- BUT IT'S VERY POPULAR IT IT CERTAIN. SCENES OF A LOT OF MEDIA ATTENTION AND- WE DON'T SEE THE GROWTH SLOWING DOWN AT ALL. THANK YOU THE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE WILL THANK THE PANELISTS FOR THEIR TESTIMONY THEIR TIME PRESHEAF YOU BEING HERE TODAY AND WILL CERTAINLY BE IN TOUCH AS WE MOVE FORWARD. OKAY MEMBERS THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO. THE THIRD PANEL TRANSPARENCY AND INTEGRITY IN SPORTS BETTING THE BETTER EXPERIENCE AND WELCOME TODD FIRM AND ANALYSTS FOXSPORTS AND CO FOUNDER AND HOST OF BET THE BOARD PODCAST AS WELL AS JAKE WILLIAMS VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGAL AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS- WITH SPORT RADAR SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND- PLEASE. JOIN US TO PROCEED WITH THE TESTIMONY THANK YOU SENATOR DODD ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS SPORTS HEARING. HI MY NAME IS TODD BERMAN AND THE GAMBLING ANALYSTS FOR BOTH CBS AND FOX SPORTS I WORK TO TRYING TO GAMBLING KIND OF FROM THE SHADOWS PROVIDE ANY MORE MAINSTREAM LANDS. AS A DIFFERENT WAY FOR THE CASUAL FAN TO UNDERSTAND KIND OF WHAT WE DO IN AND AROUND LAS VEGAS I'VE BEEN IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY IN A VARIETY OF CAPACITIES EVER SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE BREAKING IN AS A FINANCIAL ANALYST DOING TABLE GAMES ANALYTICS SLOTS. BUDGETING FINANCE YOU NAME IT FOR CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT HAVE WORKED IN A CONSULTING CAPACITY FOR A COMPANY THAT WAS ABSORBED AS PART OF SCIENTIFIC GAME HELP BUILD AND IN PLAY TRADING PLATFORM. AND IDENTIFY SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THERE NOW WILL TO MILLIE TRYING TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN WITH IT AS WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT MORE FAN TRACKS FAN ENGAGEMENT. AS IT PERTAINS TO WORK ACT SO I COME FROM A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN A LOT OF THE GUYS HAVE BEEN UP HERE SPEAKING MORE FROM THE OPERATOR STANDPOINT. I'M AN AVID SPORTS BETTER MYSELF BEEN IN THIS USE OF OPERATOR- AND MY WHOLE THING ABOUT SPORTS BETTING IS I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT CAN DO. TO THE GAME ITSELF CREATE THAT LEVEL OF FAN ENGAGEMENT ON ALL THE ANCILLARY REVENUE TO COME ALONG WITH IT NOT ONLY YOU'RE TALKING VISIT. IN TWO MORE TOPS BUT ALSO. THE NIGHT FAN. IN THEIRS. FOR THE RATIONS FULL STEAM AT A HOCKEY GAME THAT MEET. WEDDING TALK ALL AND BETTER TOTAL. ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE AT BARS WAITING OUT THE WANING SECONDS OF THE GAME IS WE'VE ALL WATCH FOOTBALL GAMES. AND MAYBE THIRTY POINT MARGINS BUT WHEN THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF SKIN IN THE GAME A CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC QUITE A BIT. RATHER THAN JUST FLIPPING OFF AND LOOKING FOR A DIFFERENT FOOTBALL GAME. SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS IT SPORTS BETTING IS IMPACTED MY LIFE AND KIND OF THE PERSPECTIVE. SO WHEN I LOOK AT IT FROM STATES THAT LOOKING TO TRY. REGULATE AND FROM A PLAYER PROTECTION STANDPOINT. COME AT IT FROM A VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES AND I THINK. A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT IN A- MORE BROAD. CONTEXTUALIZE EXAMPLE THAT A LOT OF THE GUYS IF IT ON ALREADY. AVAILABILITY BEING FIRST AND FOREMOST IN MY OPINION. THE WAGERING I KNOW IT'S BEEN A HOT BUTTON TOPIC IN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REVENUE THE- STATE'S. SELENA SEEN TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH MORE THAN 80% OF THE BATS THAT WAY. LOOK AT A STATE LIKE MISSISSIPPI THAT'S ALWAYS GONNA LAG BEHIND. BECAUSE THE MOBILE PLATFORM ISN'T SOMETHING THAT THEY FOUND. THAT NEEDED TO BE INCLUDED IN THEIR INITIAL GAMBLING BUILT. ON TAX RATE- pOF TIMES AS WELL FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE. I'LL BUT THERE'S ALSO FROM THE PLAYER'S PERSPECTIVE AS WELL BECAUSE AS YOU. FLAYED THE TAX RATE. THE PLAYERS TYPICALLY THE ONE THAT SUFFERS AND WE'VE SEEN THAT IN PENNSYLVANIA OR CERTAIN OPERATORS. ARE CHARGING OUT JUICER VIGOROUS BASICALLY THE TAX ON EVERY BAT. NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE NEVADA MODEL BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HEAR THAT 36% TAX RATE. AND AS A RESULT COSTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ROLL DOWN HILL AND- THE PLAYER. THAT ULTIMATELY SUFFERS. AND CAN CREATE A VERY DIFFERENT BETTING MARKET AS A RESULT- SPORTS INCLUDED WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THE MODELS AND I KNOW MATT SPOKE- ELOQUENTLY ABOUT ORGAN. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU WERE TO GO TO A BUSINESS MODEL AND EXCLUDE. ALL THE COLLEGIATE TEAMS I THINK IT TAKES AWAY A MASK. ON A- AS IT PERTAINS TO WHETHER IT'S BESSIE UCLA. OR ALL THE BIG WEST FANS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT WANT TO SWEAR UC RIVERSIDE BAD ON A THURSDAY NIGHT. TO TRY AND FIND SOME LEVEL OF FAN ENGAGEMENT WITH THAT. ARE YOU LOOKING NEVADA. U. N. L. V. NEVADA AS JAY TALKED ABOUT WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE GAMING LOG IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY AND BACK. BUT I THINK WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND THE MENU AND TAKE CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO PLAYING IN THOSE. AGAIN REGULATED MARKETS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE THEM THAT FULL EXPANSIVE MENU. TO INCLUDE ALL THE COLLEGE TEAMS ALL THE PROFESSIONAL TEAMS. AND GIVE THEM EVERY INCENTIVE TO TAKE THEIR MONEY FROM THAT ON REGULATED JURISDICTION WHETHER IT'S A CORNER BOOKMAKER. WERE OFF SHORE AND BRING IT INTO A MORE TRANSPARENT MARKET. BECAUSE WE LIKE TO SAY ALL THE TIME THE BEST DISINFECTANT IS ALWAYS GONNA BE TRANSPARENCY SHINING A BRIGHT LIGHT. ON THOSE PARTICULAR ROUTE- WAGER TYPES. I KNOW WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUT. ONLINE ALEX USED IN RUNNING WITH DURING. AS A POTENTIAL I THINK CERTAIN EUROPEAN SPORTS LET SELVES MUCH BETTER TO THAT TYPE OF WAGERING AMERICAN SPORTS. BUT AS THE IMAGE. AND SPOKE BETTER FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE I THINK THAT IS A MASSIVE GROWTH POTENTIAL. AND IT'S SOMETHING AGAIN THE ONLY LENDS ITSELF TO A MOBILE PLATFORM. MORE SO THAN A BRICK AND MORTAR. IF THE COLLECTIVITY OF WALKING UP TO A KIOSK FOR CONSTANTLY CHANGING ODDS. JUST NOT A REALISTIC POSSIBILITY- IN MY ESTIMATION. AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM. IT'S OH BY THINK STANDARDIZED TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT TO RUN INTO YOU ARE A LOT OF LIQUIDITY IF EVERY STATE OPERATES IN ITS OWN VACUUM. DECIDES IT ONLY WANTS TO IDENTIFY CERTAIN OPERATE. IT'S GOING TO PRECLUDE YOU FROM TAKING BUT THE BIGGER BATS THAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE SO. THE RESULT YOU'RE TAKING SMALLER MARTINS. AND YOU'RE- GONNA HAVE THIS IN. THE BACK AND ALL THAT YOU OTHERWISE. IT IS BASED ON SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES. I THINK WE'LL TALK ABOUT ALL LOCAL PAYS MARKETING PAM SHOULD PROVIDE. PERFECT AMPLE ILLUSTRATION. ARE THEY WANT FIVE IS. BETTING INTERCOLLEGIATE. THEY HAD THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WE JUST IN JUST THE FIRST. SPEAK TO THE STRENGTH AND HOW IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE THAT LOCALIZED COMPONENT TO IT. BECAUSE FANS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THAT EXTRA WAY TO GET INVOLVED. WHETHER IT'S A FIVE DOLLAR BET PRE MATCH WHETHER TO TEN DOLLAR BET AT THE HALFTIME. THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND A UNIQUE WAY. TO HAVE THAT DIFFERENT CONNECTION TO THEIR TEAM- ONE THING THAT I WILL SAY FROM THE BETTER PERSPECTIVE HAVING DEALT WITH THE FIRST HAND IS ALWAYS A RESPONSIBLE GAMING COMPONENT. WHEN YOU'RE IN A REGULATED MARKET YOU CAN SET ASIDE RESOURCES TO TRY AND TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE THAT SMALL SEGMENT OF POPULATION. THAT LET'S NOT SURE CODE INEVITABLY ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS. WITH SPORTS BETTING WHICH CAN BE A VERY ADDICTIVE. PURSUIT THE SAME YOU HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE. FOR ALCOHOL OR OTHER SUBSTANCES THAT ARE HIGHLY MONITORED HIGHLY REGULATED. YOU DON'T GET THAT IN THE OFFSHORE MARKET. YOU CAN CONSISTENTLY HAVE PEOPLE GETTING THEMSELVES INTO TROUBLE. SOME OF THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT UNFORTUNATELY. ALL COME WITH THAT WHEN YOU GO IN ON A DELAYED BASIS. I'M WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE. ONE OF THE REASONS OFTEN IGNORED. IN THE SPORTS BETTING SPACE WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT. OPERATE DANCE THE AREAS THAT ARE OUT THERE. DOING A- DROP WHEN MY- DOES MY- IN. COME THEIR PORCH THE TWO AREAS DAVE. WE ARE THEIR MAIN AREAS OF CONCERN ARE EASY TO USE INTERFACES WHICH AUTOMATICALLY IMPLIES THAT THEY'RE THINKING OF SPORTS BETTING COMING TO THEIR STATE MOBILE PLATFORM NOT THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF WALKING UP TO THE COUNTER PLACING YOUR WAGER GOING BACK TO YOUR SEAT WHAT HAVE YOU I AND MORE IMPORTANTLY COMPETITIVE PRICING AND I THINK AS WE SEE SOME OF THESE VERY STATES THEY COME ONLINE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND WHILE ME WILL CAN NOW CHARGING A PRICE ABOVE THE- AVERAGE THAT CUSTOMERS ARE GONNA GET SMARTER AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT AND GO WELL WAIT A SECOND IF YOU'RE GONNA CHARGE ME TAXES ON ALL OF THIS STUFF THAT'S OUT THERE I'M GONNA GET YOU TO GO TO THE ON REGULATED OKAY I'M GONNA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CREDIT BECAUSE IT'S A LOT EASIER TO DO THAT. IT'S A SENSE BUT THIS WAS BUILT ON WITH CREDIT CARDS AND HOUSE IT'S A VERY SIMILAR MINDSET SPORTS BETTORS ARE GONNA UTILIZED. AT THE SAME TIME. SO ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS FOR ME AS WELL AS A SPORTS. IS THIS MARKET IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S OUT THERE WHEN YOU WALK INTO A BRICK AND MORTAR CASINO. YOU SEE LIMITS CLEARLY POSTED ON THE TABLE IF YOU WALK UP TO A BLACKJACK TABLE. FIVE DOLLARS COULD BE OUR MINIMUM BAT UPWARDS OF TWO THOUSAND WHAT HAVE YOU. SPORTS BETTING IN MY OPINION IT'S KIND OF BEEN IN THAT GRAY AREA EVEN IN REGULATED MARKETS. AND IS A BETTER MYSELF I'D LOVE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE TRANSPARENCY. BECAUSE THERE ARE FORTUNATELY IS A BUSINESS MODEL OUT THERE. THAT YOU'RE INCENTIVIZE FOR SOME OPERATORS THAT IF SOMEBODY HAS AN ADVANTAGE. THAT YOU CLEARLY DON'T WANT TO TRY AND TAKE THEIR BACK. UNLIKE ANY OTHER RETAIL WHERE THE WHOLE GOAL SHOULD BE SELLING THE RIGHT PRODUCT FOR THE RIGHT PRICE. TO THE RIGHT CUSTOMER. SO WHEN I SEE SOME OF THE STATE'S COME ONLINE AND NOT THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. I'D LIKE SOME OF THAT PRESENTED IN A BLACK AND WHITE. ENTER WEIGHT. HAVE THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO OFFER LOW LIMITS AND EXPAND. COURTESIES TO CUSTOMERS. YOU FEEL HAVE PLAYED WITH YOU AND HAVE WARRANTED THOSE TYPE OF CONCESSIONS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. THERE'S NOTHING MORE INFURIATING IS A SPORTS BETTER. THAN YOU TRYING TO. LOG GAME ON A MONDAY YOU'RE GIVEN ONE ACCOUNT YOU TRYING BETTER. BALL GAME AT THE SAME OPERATOR. IS HERE GIVEN A DIFFERENT AMOUNT. AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT BECOMES A MOVING TARGET. THAT COULD BE A SOME. FRUSTRATION AND ULTIMATELY LEAD PEOPLE BACK TO SOMEBODY ON REGULATED MARKETS. WHERE OFTENTIMES THEY HAVE TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE. AND EXTEND LARGER LIMITS ON SOME OF THE- PARTICULAR SPORTING EVENTS. OF COURSE THAT DOESN'T APPLY THE MASK BUT IT IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. AS YOU GO ABOUT BUILDING TENSION BILLS INTRODUCED BIG. HOW TO WORK. BOB IS THE FACT. AND WHEN I. LOOK AT. I MEAN I. HELLO THESE THINGS HAVE. THROUGH A- WHAT I. FIND IS. QUESTION COMES UP FOR TRYING YOU'RE OUT FROM THE- FROM THE SPORTS BETTER STANDPOINT FROM THE LEAGUE STANDPOINT I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND HAVING ATTENDED A LOT OF THE SPORTING EVENTS AND INTO THE QUESTIONS OF INTEGRITY THAT INEVITABLY COME UP. I IT'S NOT A CONTENTIOUS ATMOSPHERE LATE IN THE THIRD OF A HOCKEY GAME IT'S NOT A CONTENTIOUS ATMOSPHERE DURING THE PAC TWELVE TOURNAMENT WHEN A TEAMS LOOKING AT TRYING TO SNEAK IN THE BACK DOOR OF A BASKETBALL GAME. WHAT I MEAN THERE IS ESSENTIALLY YOUR DOWN BY THIRTEEN POINTS AND YOU HAPPEN TO BE A TWELVE AND A HALF POINT UNDERDOG. THAT'S USED TO MUCH GAMBLING PARLOUR HERE. IT ENGINE THIRTY OF WATCHING THE PLAYERS DRIBBLE OUT ALL THAT MAY OR NOT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON PARTICULAR FAN SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS TO CONSIDER I THINK FAN ENGAGEMENT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPONENTS THAT COMES ALONG WITH IT- BECAUSE AS TAX REVENUES GROW YOU ALSO DO YOU SEE SOME OF THE AUNTS THEIR INCOME FOR SUBSIDIARY BUSINESSES EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE CLICHES THAT OFF RISING TIDES WILL RAISE ALL SHIPS AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SPORTS GAMBLING IN THE POTENTIAL LEGALIZATION TO TRY AND TAKE IT FROM THE SHADOWS AND BREAKING INTO THE BRIGHT LIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT EXPANDED MENU I HAVE THAT MOBILE OFFERING AND TRYING TO GIVE THE CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY CAN HONESTLY GO OUT AND GET AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE WITHIN EASY TRANSACTION- EVERY HOUSE IN THE SPACE I PROBABLY SPOKEN TOO LONG SO IF THERE'S ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- LOOK FOR TO ANSWERING ALL THAN THAT YOU GUYS MAY HAVE US IN MY EXPERIENCE AS I SAID EITHER AS AN OPERATOR AS A MATTER WHERE SOMEBODY THANKS MAKES. GAMBLING IS A STREAM I. POSSIBLY CAN. THANK YOU. DAVID HAS MORE THAN A DAY. I UNDERSTAND BILL SENATOR JONES IS HER BRADFORD OF OFFER TO COME ON YOUR SHOW AND GIVE. WELL THE WAY THE WAY MY SEASON IS GONE I WOULD WILLINGLY ACCEPT ANY PICS FROM YOU GUYS SO IF YOU GUYS WHEN WE CAN TRY AND WORK OUT A POSITIVE ARRANGEMENT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WE ALL MAKE THAT HAPP. I APPRECIATE. THE MILLION INSTAGRAM ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE- AT THIS TIME WILL WELCOME JAKE WHICH. THANK YOU TO EMIGRATE GERMAN DODD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS JACK WILLIAMS AND I'M THE VICE RESIDENT OF LEGAL AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS WITH SPORT RIGHT UP. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN- I'VE BEEN WORKING FOOTBALL RIGHT AREN'T AS A COMPANY WE SIT IN A PRETTY UNIQUE SITUATION- WITHIN THE SPORTS WAGERING ECOSYSTEM. WE'RE TRULY GLOBAL COMPANY WITH MORE THAN THIRTY OFFICES AROUND THE WORLD. INCLUDING NEW YORK- U. S. HEADQUARTERS IN MINNEAPOLIS AS WELL AS TO- OFFICES HERE IN CALIFORNIA ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO ANOTHER IN MENLO PARK. WHETHER LEADING SERVICE PROVIDED A TO SPORTS WAGERING OPERATE IS SPORTS LEAGUES REGULATORS LAW ENFORCEMENT'S AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE SPORTS WAGERING AND SPORTS INTEGRITY SPACE. ADDITIONALLY BALL RIGHT OFFIS THE OFFICIAL DAUGHTER PROVIDE UP TO MANY- SPORTS LEAGUES IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS AROUND THE WORLD. GIVEN THAT WE THINK WE KNOW FIRST SOME UNIQUE INSIGHTS INTO MANY FACETS OF. THE BUSINESS OF SPORTS WAGERING AS WELL AS REGULATION. GIVEN WE HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME I'M NOT GONNA RETREAD SOME OF THE TOPICS IN TOO MUCH DETAIL YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT IN DETAIL TODAY I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON THREE MAIN AREAS THE FIRST BEING INTEGRITY OF THE GAME AND I BELIEVE WE'VE ALREADY HAD QUESTIONS ON THAT FROM EARLIER TODAY- ONLINE MOBILE IN PLACE SPORTS WAGERING I'LL TALK ABOUT VERY BRIEFLY AS WELL AS THE ABSORPTION. OF CURRENTS SPORTS WAGERING TAKING PLACE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND BRINGING THAT TO SIT WITHIN A REGULATED FRAMEWORK. SO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO START WITH SPORTS INTEGRITY OF HEARD FROM. THE OPERATE ASIDE IN THE PREVIOUS GROUP YOU PROBABLY HEAR MORE FROM. THE SPORTS LEAGUE SIDE I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN INSIGHT INTO THE THIS BILL RIGHT OUTSIDE. SPORT RADAR IS THE GLOBAL LEADER IN MONITORING THE INTEGRITY OF SPORT AND PREVENTING MATCH FIXING. THROUGH BET MONITORING. EDUCATION AS WELL AS INTELLIGENCE AND INVESTIGATION SOLUTIONS FOR. REGULATORS LARA ENFORCEMENTS AS WELL AS SPORTS LEAGUES. GIVEN OUR EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN REGULATED MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD WELL HAPPY TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCES ON MOST EFFECTIVE PRACTICES FOR PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF SPORTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING WHY REGULATED AND COMPETITIVE MARKET IS THE SUREST WAY TO UPHOLD THE HIGHEST INTEGRITY STANDARDS. OVER A HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING US MOSTLY EXACTLY MBA MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL THE NFL NHL- AN MLS AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL FEDERATIONS LIKE FIFA. AND THE INTERNATIONAL TENNIS FEDERATION UTILIZE OUR SERVICES AND EXPERTISE IN SUPPORT INTEGRITY SPACE TO COMBAT MANY OF THE KEY THREATS TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME. A REGULATED SPORTS WAGERING MARKET WITH THE ROBUST INTEGRITY FRAMEWORK FOR MONITORING WAGERING. IN CONTRAST TO THE UNREGULATED AND LEGAL MARKET HAS CLEAR INTEGRITY BENEFITS. BRINGING AS MUCH OF THE UNREGULATED WAGERING UNDER THE SOPHISTICATED AND TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED MICRO SCOPE OF BET MONITORING CAN ONLY INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF DETECTING AND THWARTING ANY ATTEMPT TO FIX OR OTHERWISE CORRUPT A SPORTING EVENT. WE ALL UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME IS AND I'LL LET YOU ASK ANY FURTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS- POST MY TESTIMONY I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON THE OTHER TWO AREAS VERY BRIEFLY BEFORE I BEFORE I FINISH UP THAT BEING ONLINE AND MOBILE AND IN PLACE BOTH WAGERING. AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT TOGETHER WITH THE ABSORPTION OF CURRENT UNREGULATED SPORTS WAGERING THAT IS HAPPENING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVE IS. LEGALIZING REGULATING SPORTS WAGERING SHOULD BE TO CAPTURE THE UNREGULATED MARKET THAT'S TAKING PLACE ALREADY. IN DOING SO WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT DRIVES ABSORPTION OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND USE BEST PRACTICES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS MR GROVE ALREADY MENTIONED THROUGH THE NEW JERSEY DIVISION OF GAMING ENFORCEMENT WE KNOW THAT SPORTS BETTORS IN NEW JERSEY OF PLACE MORE THAN 80% OF ALL WAGES. VIA MOBILE DEVICES AND ON THE INTERNET. FURTHER TO THIS AS MR SHAPIRO ALSO MENTIONED IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. THAT HAVE HAD MORE TIME TO MATURE THAN THE CURRENT U. S. LANDSCAPE IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR IN PLAY WAGERING TO RETRAIN HANDLE- AS MENTIONED SPORTS LIKE TENNIS AND SOCCER LEND THEMSELVES TO THIS IN PLAY WAGER. WHAT THESE METRICS AND EVEN TRENDS TELL US. IS THAT THE FUTURE OF ONLINE AND MOBILE SPORTS WAGERING IS LIKELY TO INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT BETTING ACTIVITY. DURING A LOT OF THAT. IF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE INTERESTED IN ENGAGING SPORTS WAGERING ARE EXCLUDED FROM DOING SO IN THAT JURISDICTION THEY MAY LOOK ELSEWHERE. AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF REGULATING THE PRACTICE BECOMES LESS ACHIEVABLE. I PERSONALLY LIVE IN NEW JERSEY AND I'VE ALREADY NOTICED MANY PEOPLE AT THE FAVORITE SPORTS VENUE. ALL THE OLD SORRY AT THE- WILL ENJOY THEIR FAVORITE SPORTS VENUE- WITH PHONE IN HAND PLACING BETS IN THE PRE GAME OR DURING A LIVE GAME MY WIFE A LOYAL FAN AND SEASON TICKET HOLDER FOR THE NEW YORK JETS WILL OFTEN PLACE BETS. DURING THE GAME WALLS WATCHING HER BELOVED TEAM. AS WITH MANY OTHER RECREATIONAL ENDEAVORS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY BEING ABLE TO DO SO- FROM YOUR DEVICE. FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR HOME OR YOUR FAVORITE LOCATION WILL BE A PILLAR OF ANY SUCCESSFUL FRAMEWORK. THAT AIMS TO BRING ALL WAGERING ACTIVITY WITHIN A REGULATED FRAMEWORK. LAND BASED ONLINE. MORE WELL IN PLACE BOLTS WAGERING. SHOULD BE INCLUDED INTO THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO AND TO ENSURE REGULATED AND LICENSED OPERATORS ARE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH UNLICENSED OPERATORS. AND JUST FINALLY I WANT TO TOUCH ON ANY OTHER RESTRICTIONS CONDITIONS. OTHER APPLY TWENTY STAKEHOLDERS FOR EXAMPLE OF HEARD ABOUT. PROHIBITIONS ON PROPOSITION BETS OR EVEN ON REASONABLE AND BURDENSOME LICENSING CONDITIONS FOR THOSE ENTERING THE MARKET. SHOULD BE CRITICALLY EVALUATED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE INTEGRITY AIMS TO OPTIMIZE MARKET CONDITIONS FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AND A CHANNEL ON REGULATED WAGERING ACTIVITY TO SIT WITHIN THESE REGULATED FRAMEWORKS. THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ASK SORRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. IS FUHRMAN. WHAT'S A LIGHT ON THE NIGHT- VIKING GAME THIS WEEKEND IT WHICH WHERE YOU GO AND. OPEN AT SEVEN IT WAS BACK DOWN TO SIX AND A HALF AND NOW SEVEN PRETTY MUCH THE CONSENSUS I CAN GIVE YOU THE FULL BREAKDOWN OREGON HAVE YOU TUNE INTO THE SHOW TOMORROW. WHERE WE CAN REALLY GET THAT I CAN KEEP MY FOX- GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND LAWYERS HAPPY BUT THE BUILDING RIGHT NOW WOULD BE TO POINTS BEING AT A PREMIUM IN THAT FOOTBALL GAME BUT WE CAN HAVE THAT STRICKEN FROM THE TESTIMONY OF THE GAME GOES WELL. OVER FORTY FOUR AND A. WELL YOU HAVE BEEN DOING VERY WELL THIS. THAT YOU KNOW. I APPRECIATE THAT MAYBE THIS CAN BE WHAT I NEED TO PROPEL ME TO A STRONG FINISH TO THE SEASON THAT'S ALRIGHT PERFECT. OKAY OTHER THAN THE FORTY NINERS TO HAVE. UNFORTUNATELY YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ANYWHERE IN THE STATE OF NEVADA OR TO MY KNOWLEDGE ANY OF THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS HERE CURRENTLY IN THE STATE SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND AN UNREGULATED MARKET TO FIND PRICES THERE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GO ABOUT PRICING THING SO I COULD EVEN SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH IF I TRY. THIS IS WITH MOST POPULAR PANEL. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS NUMBERS IN THIS TIME. SEEING NONE- APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY AND WILL CERTAINLY TO AN END TO THE SHOW AND- SEE IF I CAN LEAD TO THOSE EXPECTATIONS OKAY THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU ASKED. OKAY AT THIS TIME MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR FINAL PANEL OF THE DAY THE IMPACT OF SPORTS BETTING ON PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LEAGUES. WE'RE GONNA WELCOME BOTH THE DANCE PLANE VICE PRESIDENT AND ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL WITH THE NBA. AND RYAN CEILING SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT- DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATIONS COMPLIANCE AND SECURITY WITH MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL WELCOME GENTLEMEN AND PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN GRAY CHAIRMAN DODD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THE OPPORTUNITY SHARE THE VIEWS OF THE NBA ON SPORTS BETTING IN CALIFORNIA- MY NAME IS DANCE BLAINE I'M SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL FOR LEAGUE GOVERNANCE AND POLICY WITH THE NBA- IN MY JOB RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE SETTING AND ENFORCING LEGAL POLICIES. WITH RESPECT TO SPORTS GAMBLING. THE NBA HAS A STRONG INTEREST IN HOW SPORTS BETTING- IS HANDLED IN EVERY STATE BUT PARTICULARLY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE FOUR NBA TEAMS IN THE STATE AND ON TOP OF THAT- EAT- OTHER TEAMS ACROSS THE W.NBA. THE NBA G. LEAGUE AND THE NBA TO KAYLEE. AND ALTHOUGH I WORK IN NEW YORK I GREW UP IN THE BAY AREA MY WIFE AND I ARE CAL GRADS AND STILL HAVE FAMILY IN THE AREA SO I HAVE A PERSONAL INTEREST IN HOW THIS UNFOLDS AS WELL. I'M JOINED TODAY BY BRIAN SEALY OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL AND OUR ORGANIZATIONS HAVE A SHARED VIEW ON HOW SPORTS BETTING SHOULD BE LEGALIZED AND REGULATED SO IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AT THE END OF THE DAY TO HELP EXPEDITE THINGS- WE WON'T DUPLICATE EACH OTHER'S TESTIMONY WILL DIVIDE AND CONQUER A LITTLE BIT AN EXERCISE DIFFERENT POINTS. AND EACH OF US WILL JOIN IN THE OTHER STATEMENTS. THE NBA HAS INVESTED A LOT OF TIME AND RESOURCES- OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND STUDYING. THE ISSUE OF SPORTS GAMBLING AND- AND BEGINNING TO ENGAGE- FROM A COMMERCIAL STANDPOINT IN THE INDUSTRY AND THINK ABOUT WHAT LEGISLATION SHOULD LOOK LIKE. ADD OUR VIEW IS THAT SPORTS BETTING- PROPERLY REGULATED CAN HAVE BENEFITS TO BRING BEDDING OUT OF THE SHADOWS INTO THE SUNLIGHT- TO GIVE US TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR BETTING ON OUR GAMES AND PROTECT THE FANS. WHO BET ON SPORTS. UPI WANT TO FOCUS IN TODAY'S REMARKS ON THE PERSPECTIVE OF A PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LEAGUE WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM- OPERATORS AND OHERS WHO ARE ENGAGED- IN THE SPORTS BETTING BUSINESS ALTHOUGH THERE A LOT OF SHARED INTERESTS THERE ARE SOME THAT REALLY I THINK ARE ARE UNIQUE TO SPORTS- IN SHORT AS IS CALIFORNIA IS CONSIDERING THIS TOPIC I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADOPT AN APPROACH TO TREAT SPORTS LEAGUES AS PARTNERS- AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS BUSINESS RATHER THAN AS BYSTANDERS AND TO BECOME A NATIONAL LEADER. IN THIS AREA. ALL ADDRESS TO PARTICULAR ISSUES TODAY MOBILE BETTING AND CONSUMER PROTECTION IN PARTICULAR THE SOURCES OF DATA THAT ARE USED TO. SEC ODDS AND TO SETTLE BATS AND BRIAN WILL ADDRESS OTHER ISSUES RELATING TO HOW SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS CAN POLICE THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR COMPETITIONS. FIRST SPORTS BETTING AS OTHERS- IN THIS HEARING HAVE SAID IT SHOULD BE AUTHORIZED ON INTERNET AND MOBILE PLATFORMS AND NOT JUST A PHYSICAL BRICK AND MORTAR LOCATIONS. OUR ENTIRE APPROACH TO THE ISSUE OF SPORTS BETTING IS PREDICATED ON THE REALITY THAT PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE ALREADY- BETTING ON SPORTS- LARGELY THROUGH ONLINE APPS THAT ARE OPERATED BY OFFSHORE BOOK MAKERS. AND A COMPETITIVE MOBILE BETTING MARKET IS ESSENTIAL TO THE STATE'S ABILITY TO SHIFT BETTERS- FROM THESE ILLEGAL MARKETS TO LEGAL BETTING MARKETS. AND WITHOUT AN APPEALING MOBILE OPTION PEOPLE JUST CONTINUE TO BET ON THEIR PHONES OR ARE USING COMPUTERS WITH OFFSHORE SITES BETTING ALSO IS BETTER SUITED TO THE PREFERENCES OF SPORTS FANS WHO INCREASINGLY ENGAGE WITH SPORTS ONLINE AND USING MOBILE DEVICES. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO THAT OFFSHORE AREN'T EVEN AWARE OF THAT DOING SO ILLEGALLY AND OF A SPORTS FAN IS INTERESTED IN PLACING A BAD THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO DO THAT. SAFELY AND LEGALLY. SECOND POINT IS SPORTS BETTING FRAMEWORK- ALSO SHOULD INCLUDE EFFECTIVE CONSUMER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS. ADD THESE WOULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE A RIGOROUS LICENSING PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT OPERATORS ARE PROPERLY VETTED. AGE RESTRICTIONS SELF EXCLUSION PROGRAMS AND OTHER MEASURES TO ADDRESS PROBLEM GAMBLING. THESE ARE REASONABLE REGULATIONS THAT SHOULD APPLY TO ALL TYPES OF GAMBLING INCLUDING BETTING ON SPORTS. WITH RESPECT TO SOME IN PARTICULAR- THIS PACKAGE OF CAN SHOOT CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURES SHOULD INCLUDE A MANDATE THAT OPERATORS USE OFFICIALLY DATA TO SETTLE IN GAME AND PROPOSITION BETS WHICH INCLUDE- BEST THAT ARE PLACED AFTER A GAME STARTS IN OFTEN RESOLVED BEFORE IT ENDS. AS OPERATORS INCREASINGLY OFFER IN GAME AND PROPOSITION BETS MAINTAINING RELIABLE MARKETS FOR THESE WAITERS IS GOING TO BECOME MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE COMPLICATED. AND REQUIRING OFFICIAL LEAGUE DATA TO RESOLVE THESE BATS WILL HELP ENSURE THE ACCURACY AND CONSISTENCY OF BETTING OUTCOMES. AND GIVE CALIFORNIA BETTERS ACCESS TO RELIABLE AND WELL FUNCTIONING IN GAME AND PROPOSITION BETTING MARKETS. FOR REFERENCE AND MATURE BETTING MARKETS OVERSEAS A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF BETTING VOLUME AND THE U. K. UPWARDS OF 70% COMES FROM IN GAME OFFERINGS AND WE EXPECT A SIMILAR TRENDS TO TAKE HOLD IN THE U. S. IS BETTING MARKETS OF ALL HERE. AND WE UNDERSTAND FROM OUR BEDDING OFF YOUR PARTNERS THAT IN SOME PLACES ARE NEW OPERATIONS ARE ALREADY- ABOVE THE 50% MARK. SO A WELL FUNCTIONING IN GAME MARKET IS ESSENTIAL TO THE HEALTH OF THE SPORTS BETTING MARKET OVERALL. THREE STATES HAVE ADOPTED UNOFFICIALLY DATA REQUIREMENT AND WE EXPECT MORE TO FOLLOW THIS YEAR- THERE IS A VERY HELPFUL SLIDE PRESENTTION AT THE BEGINNING THAT- I JUST NEEDED TO BE UPDATED OR THREE STATES I THINK THAT WHEN IT SAID THERE WERE TWO. EACH OF THESE ELEMENTS AND DOES THAT BRIAN WILL BE ADDRESSING IS CRITICAL TO THE NBA SUPPORT. OF LEAGUE OF SPORTS BETTING LEGISLATION IN CALIFORNIA AND OUR FIRST AND PARAMOUNT RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF PROTECTION OF PERSONAL BASKETBALL. AND ALSO PRESERVE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN OUR LEAGUE AND IN OUR SPORT. WE HOPE YOU'LL INCLUDE THESE PRINCIPLES AND WHATEVER FRAMEWORK- YOU ULTIMATELY ADOPT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE WITH REGULATORS WITH BETTING OPERATORS TO MAKE SURE THAT SPORTS BETTING- AND IN CALIFORNIA IS SAFE AND SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIRMAN GRAY CHAIRMAN DODD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S BRIAN CEILING ON- SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT DEBBIE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL I- MY WORK IN MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL REALLY FOCUSES ON PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY AND THE SECURITY OF THE GAME. SHE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY APPRECIATE- YOUR TRYING TO ADVANCE LEGAL SPORTS BETTING CALIFORNIA WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT OF- CONSTITUTIONAL MINUTES SIXTEEN. AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER- TO TRY TO BRING A LEGAL REGULATED SAFE MARKET. THAT PROTECTS CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND PROTECTS OUR SPORT- I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT BETTING BUT EVERYONE TODAY'S TALKED ABOUT BETTING SO INDULGING WHILE I TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SPORTS THE FIRST WORD IN SPORTS BETTING- CALIFORNIA'S A REALLY IMPORTANT STATE. FOR MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL WE HAVE FIVE CLUBS HERE THAT'S BY FAR THE MOST OF ANY STATE- WE HAVE MORE ON TEAMS HERE I THINK THAN ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL. LEAGUE YET IN THE U. S. AFTER THE WORLD SERIES THIS PAST DECADE INCLUDED A TEAM FROM CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL. OUR OUR OUR CLUBS HERE WE CALL CLUBS NOT TEAMS THAT SORT OF MLB LINGO OUR CLUBS ON HAD BEEN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES AND THEY BECOME IMPORTANT PARTS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES- WHEN I'M- WALKING AROUND LA- I KNOW IT'S WEIRD WALKING ALIVE. I DO THAT- WHEN I WALK AROUND LA I SEE PEOPLE OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE ALL RACES ALL AGES ALL NATIONALITIES WEARING DAUGHTERS CAPS. IN A WORLD THAT EEMS SORT OF INCREASE. PRICE WERE COMMON GROUNDCAN BE HARD TO FIND PEOPLE FIND COMMON GROUND IN THAT THEY FIND COMMON GROUND IN BASEBALL. IT'S PART OF WHAT BRINGS PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TING OTHER IT BECOMES PART OF THEIR SHARED HISTORY. PART OF THEIR SHARED IDENTITY- AND THAT'S IMPORTANT- BUT IN ADDITION TO BASEBALL PLACE IN THE CULTURE ARE OUR CLUBS OR AN ECONOMIC ENGINE FOR THE STATE. WITH THE FIVE OF THEM- THEY EMPLOY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE- THEY GENERATE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ANNUAL TAX REVENUE THEY SPEND TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN CALIFORNIA. WE PLAY OVER FOUR HUNDRED GAMES A YEAR IN THIS STATE. BY FAR THE MOST IN IN A- WEEK- AND FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WALK ECHO PARK IN SAN DIEGO ON A GAME DAY- YOU SEE- THE ECONOMIC ACT. THAT IS GENERATED BY THAT CAN HELP. IN VITAL IT IS TO- BUSINESSES IN DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO. OUR CLUBS AND OUR PLAYERS ARE ALSO FORCES FOR IT IN THEIR IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WE GIVE BACK A LOT- INCLUDING THROUGH OUR YOUTH ACADEMY IN COMPTON CALIFORNIA WHERE WE PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL AND BASEBALL AND SOFTBALL INSTRUCTION OPPORTUNITIES TO YOUNG PEOPLE. AS PART OF OUR LEGACY IN A- CONNECTION WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ALL STAR GAME READ ME DONATING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO COMMUNITY ENRICHMENT PROJECTS AROUND LOS ANGELES- AND OUR PLAYERS DO YOU- CHARITABLE EFFORTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SO THE REALLY FORCE FOR GOOD. SO WELL WHY AM I TELLING YOU ALL THIS- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT KEEP THAT IN MIND BECAUSE THAT IS WORTH PROTECTING. AND SPORTS BETTING IS GOING TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON BASEBALL. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA- GET IT RIGHT- PARTICULAR BECAUSE THIS WILL BE THE LARGEST SPORTS BETTING MARKET IN THE COUNTRY- AND- IT WILL BE A STATE THAT OTHER STATES LOOK TO. AND SO WHAT IS GET YOUR RIGHT MEAN IN TERMS OF SPORTS INTEGRITY ALL TALK ABOUT THREE THINGS BRIEFLY. THE FIRST THING IS ANY LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR SPORTS BETTING SHOULD INCLUDE MANDATORY COOPERATION BETWEEN LEAGUES SPORTS BETTING OPERATORS AND REGULATORS. MY BACKGROUND IS INVESTIGATIONS I WAS A FORMER PROSECUTOR- AND I CAME TO BASEBALL TO HEAD UP THE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATIONS AND I KNOW AS A FORMER INVESTIGATOR- OR IN KERN INVESTIGATOR THAT. YOU KNOW THE QUALITY YOUR INVESTIGATIONS INTO POTENTIAL MANIPULATION OF PROBLEMS WITH INTEGRITY YOU'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS THE INFORMATION YOU CAN RECEIVE. A LOT OF THEM INFORMATION IS IN THE HANDS OF THE OPERATORS AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THEY WORK TOGETHER WITH WEEKS- AND PROVIDE US- INFORMATION ABOUT ABNORMAL BACK. EARNS ABOUT SUSPICIOUS BETTING ACTIVITY THINGS THAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT. A SECOND ITEM IT'S IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ABILITY TO WORK WITH REGULATORS. ON WHAT KIND OF BATS CAN BE OFFERED WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO RESTRICT THAT'S ON THE OUTCOMES OF OUR GAMES WERE NOT EVEN LOOKING TO RESTRICT BETTING ON YOU KNOW WHAT THE NEXT PLAYER WILL DO IN THE NEXT AT BAT. BUT THEY'RE CERTAIN BETTING THAT PROVIDES- GREATER RISK OF PRESENTS GREATER RISK OF THOSE CAN BE REALLY SMALL GRANULAR BATS LIKE SOMETHING ON A BALL OR STRIKE. ALSO BETTING ON THE LOWER LEVELS OF BASEBALL ON JUST PRESENTS MORE RISK FOR MANIPULATION SO WE'D LIKE THIS YOU KNOW IN ANY LAW TO HAVE A VEHICLE TO WORK WITH THE REGULATOR. ON WHAT KIND OF. CAN BE. I'M FINE I. REALLY PROTECT SPORTS INTEGRITY- WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A MOBILE OPTION. THE ILLEGAL MOBILE BETTING MARKET IN CALIFORNIA IS A THREAT TO INTEGRITY ILLEGAL OPERATORS AND DO NOT. COOPERATE WITH MY INVESTIGATIONS HEY DO NOT PROVIDE US INFORMATION ABOUT SUSPICIOUS BETTING ACTIVITY OR ABNORMAL PATTERNS ON AND SO TO REALLY PROTECT SPORTS INTEGRITY YOU NEED TO STAMP OUT THE LEGAL MARKET AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. I CAN NEVER STAMP OUT COMPLETELY AS OTHER PEOPLE TALK ABOUT DAY- BUT YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO STAMP IT OUT IF YOU DON'T GIVE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ON A LEGAL SAFE OPTION FOR MOBILE BETTING. IN CALIFORNIA ARE BETTING ON THE PHONES NOW. ON IT'S EASY AND SO UNLESS YOU PROVIDE THAT OPTION AND THEN YOU'RE REALLY NOT DOING THE MOST YOU CAN TO PROTECT SPORTS INTEGRITY. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY. TERMS OF YEAH- MISPLAYED YOU- BROUGHT UP OFFICIALLY DATA I CAN SEE WHY THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS OPPOSED TO. USING THE. WHO WHO ARE THE OTHER SPORTS. BOOK OR WHOEVERTHE THEIR STATISTICS IT'S I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO ASK YOU IS WHAT KEEPS SOME OF YOUR EMPLOYEES OR- OR EVEN A MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL TO- OF GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THIS AND ALL OF SUDDEN TRIED TO. YOU KNOW MOVE THE NUMBERS- FOR THEIR SELF GRATIFICATION SO TO SPEAK YEAH THAT STUFF IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND ONE THAT I SPEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS. OF HOW DO WE MAKE SURE. SITUATION YEAH. I'M SORRY. HOW TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE IN OUR ORGANIZATIONS- ORGANIZATION UNDERSTAND THE RULES HOW DO WE ENFORCE THEM HOW DO WE DETECT- ACTIVITY THAT- IS CONTRARY TO THE RULES AND SO LET ME SAY A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS ONE IS- THE MANY LAYERS. OF REVIEW AND REDUNDANCY IN THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS WE HAVE- FOUR OR MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE AT THE STATISTICIANS STATISTICIANS TABLE IN A GAME THAT ARE COLLECTING CHECKING EACH OTHER'S WORK THERE'S AN CONSIDER. THESE FLAGS WILL GO UP. THE APP. ON THEIR REVIEWERS IT OUR OPERATIONS CENTER IN AUGUST JERSEY THAT ARE LOOKING AT THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE ARENA THEY SPOT THINGS THAT SEEM WRONG AND THEY WILL OVERRIDE THAT AND CHANGE IT OR PHONE IN- YOU KNOW TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE- TABULATING THE DATA AND SAY I THINK WE YOU SOMETHING'S OFF HERE AND ALL AGREE ON. ON FIXING THAT AND THEIR OTHER LAYERS REVIEW THE CHAIN AS WELL TO MAKE SURE OR- ANYTHING THAT IT. GETS CORRECTED SO. ONE PERSON CAN BE ABLE TO MANIPULATE OUR DATA. HEY THERE. ANY KIN OF BEDDING OUTCOME OR OR ANYTHING ELSE THIRTY KEY. I TAX AND LET. PLACE BROADLY WE HAVE- VERY SWEEPING INTEGRITY PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE TRAINING ALL OF OUR PERSONNEL. WHAT ARE RULES ARE IN THOSE RULES BY THE WAY ARE INCREDIBLY STRICT- LEAGUE PERSONNEL CAN'T. BET ON THE NBA CAN'T SHARE INSIDE INFORMATION CONNECTION WITH GAMBLING ON NBA GAMES AND OF COURSE. CAN'T MANIPULATE OR DO ANYTHING THAT IS INTENDED TO MANIPULATE A GAME OUTCOME OR SOMETHING THAT THAT HAPPENS IN A GAME FOR IMPROPER PURPOSES- YOU CAN GET A LIFETIME BAN. FROM THE LEAGUE IF YOU VIOLATE THESE RULES- AND WE ARE TRYING TO GET AT OUR PERSONNEL AND AS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OVER THE COURSE OF THE SEASON AS WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE SAID I DIDN'T KNOW- I COULDN'T DO THAT. THEY HAD YOU KNOW TAKE A REALLY STRICT ACT AND IF WE FIND SOMETHING SO. THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS WE DO. DIRECT MY QUESTION TO SEE THE- WE'VE HAD FOUR PANELS THUS FAR TODAY. ON THIS QUESTION OF NOT JUST THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAMES BUT THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE THE. THE STATE PUBLIC GOOD NOT A SINGLE PAYER WILLIS HAS SUGGESTED THUS FAR THAT HAVING A BRICK AND MORTAR ONLY WITHOUT AN ONLINE COMPONENT IS GOOD FOR ANY THAT. WOULD YOU CONCUR WITH THOSE COMMENTS. WELL. I'D SAY THIS I I'M NOT IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY PER SE RIGHT SO I DON'T- MY EXPERTISE IS NOT GAMING PRODUCTS BUT- I DO THINK THAT- AS A PANELIST SAID EARLIER I WOULD AGREE IN TERMS OF THAT UP THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE BETTING THAT'S AVAILABLE IF YOU'RE DOING IT RETAIL- IS NOT DIFFERENT A LOT ON SMALLER IN SCOPE THAN WHAT YOU CAN DO ONLINE PARTICULAR WITH IN PLAY BETTING AND I DO THINK. AND WE THINK THAT IMPORTANT ADDING IS THE FUTURE OF THAT AND IT'S BETTING IN EUROPE OUR GAME IS PRETTY DO SERVICE AS ONE OF THE PANELISTS SPOKE TO FOR IN PLAY BETTING WE THINK. IF DONE. AND DONE AS PART OF THE FRAME. OF TEXAN TERRY GAME IT CAN BE REALLY GOOD FOR ENGAGEMENT OUR FANS AND NOT SOMETHING WE WANT AND THAT GROWS THE PIE FOREVER. THE MORE SPECIFICALLY NAM I ASK YOU TO SPEAK. TO THE BUSINESS OF GAMING BUT AS IT RELATES TO INTEGRITY OF THE GAME YEAH HAVE AN ONLINE COMPONENT IS. ABSOLUTELY AND- I CAME TO THAT CONCLUSION VERY EARLY IN EDUCATING MYSELF ABOUT THIS BECAUSE- BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS A ROBUST ILLEGAL MARKET- THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR INTEGRITY IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A LEGAL ALTERNATIVE- AND IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE A TRANSPARENT. AND IF TRANSPARENCY- IS WHAT- SURE IS INTEGRITY AND SO WE'RE TRANSPARENT YOU MAKE THE MARKET THE MORE THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE MARKET THE OPERATORS THE REGULATORS THE LEAGUE'S WORK TOGETHER- THE BETTER IT'S GOING TO BE FOR THE LEASE THE BETTER IT'S GOOD. FOR CONSUMERS AND. SINCE HE'S IN INTO THE PRODUCT THEY'RE GONNA BUT MORE IN THAT FOR THE STATE COFFERS AS WELL AS WEBER EIGHTY I THINK IT REALLY RIGHT RESULT BOATS. BOTH THE MID SHIP KIND OF LARGER SPORTS ECONOMY THIS IS. I THINK A PART OF DISCUSSION. THIS SEEMS TO GET LOST. I THINK WE HAVE DIALOGUE AMONGST THE MEMBERS THAT WE SHOULD LEGISLATURE. ON A PRETTY ROBUST SPORTS COMING CALIFORNIA YOU MENTION FIVE- BASEBALL TEAMS I THINK WE HAVE- IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIFTEEN- PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAMS- UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT I ASSUME EMPLOY. WE YOU SAID THAT TENS OF MILLIONS AND- A FEW THOUSAND BUT I SUSPECT IF WE- TAKE THAT- THAT ENTIRE ECONOMY THAT'S PRETTY FAST ENOUGH NOT TO MENTION- IT WILL PANELISTS HERE TODAY THAT HAS A. TV SHOULD. DEAL WITH THE CURRENT BETTING WE'VE GOT. SPORTS SHOWS IT SEEMS THAT BOTH SPORTS WAGERING AND FANTASY SPORTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY TIED TO THE SUCCESS OF YOUR ISSUE IN A AND AS I WATCH AS A LAY PERSON- YOU KNOW BASEBALL MAKE RULE CHANGES- TO TRY TO ADAPT AND EVOLVE- I ASSUME TO- THE CONSUMPTION HABITS OF BASEBALL FANS- HOW INTEGRAL CRITICAL. IS SPORTS BETTING IN AND FANTASY SPORTS TO THE FUTURE OF NOT JUST BASEBALL BUT THE SPORTS ECONOMY AS A WHOLE. AND WHAT IS THAT MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA WITH FIFTY PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAMS. HI I CERTAINLY COULDN'T GIVE A NUMBER OR PERCENTAGE TO IT WE'VE- BEEN PRETTY OPEN ABOUT THE NOTION THAT- ADDITION TO THE INTEGRITY BENEFITS OF LEGAL BETTING THERE'S A FAN ENGAGEMENT. BENEFIT AS WELL THAT PEOPLE IT'S AN IT IS ANOTHER FUN WAY FOR PEOPLE TO ENGAGE WITH SPORTS AND PEOPLE WHO- ARE BETTING ON SPORTS ARE PLAYING FANTASY OR OTHERWISE HAVE SOME- SOME STAKE IN THE GAME ARE GOING TO WATCH GAMES LONGER GONNA WATCH MORE GAMES CONSUMER THEIR CONTENT TO JUST BE MORE INTO IT WHICH IS- KIND OF STATING THE OBVIOUS BUT- THAT'S THAT'S PART. THE IS THIS THIS YEAR NOW HOW MUCH OF THAT COMES FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT COOLEY WHO ARE PLACING BETS BEFORE VERSUS PEOPLE WHO ARE SHIFTING FROM ILLEGAL OPERATOR TO. OPERATOR I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE DATA TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT YET- AND- LARA HART THIS IS HAVE. A LOT OF OTHER CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES% BEYOND SPORTS BETTING THIS IS A YOU KNOW A TOPIC THAT WORK FULL CON RIGHT NOW THERE ARE RISKS. BUT ALSO OPPORTUNITIES THERE. WERE ALSO FOCUSED ON A LOT OF- OPPORTUNITY AS WELL TERMS OF INTER PERSONAL NEW TYPE. OF MEDIA AND LIKE THAT. TEAMS HAVE DONE THAT IN STATES WHERE IT'S LEGAL AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE. MORE OF THAT TO AN THEIR OPPORTUNITIES- IN THOSE AGREEMENTS TO GROW. THE BUSINESS RIGHT IT YOU CAN HAVE A MORE ROBUST SPORTS BETTING MARKET WHEN LEAGUES ARE PARTICIPATING AT ONE OPERATORS CAN USE LEGAL LITTLE PROPERTY WHEN YOU HAVE OFFICIAL DATA IT IS PART OF THE SYSTEM. WHEN YOU HELP THE LEGAL OPERATORS TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES FROM ILLEGAL OPERATORS THAT'S A PLUS FOR EVERYBODY. FOR BOTH OF YOU IN STATES WITH EXISTING BOOKS SPORTS BETTING DO ANY OF YOUR TEAMS HAVE ON SITE. SPORTS BETTING FACILITIES. IF SO CAN YOU KIND OF DESCRIBE HOW THEY OPERATE. ALTHOUGH FIRST NOT NOT YET- THERE- THERE'S BEEN AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE WIZARDS AND MONUMENTAL SPORTS OF A SPORTS BOOK THAT WILL BE. PART OF THE CAPITAL ONE AENA STRUCTURE- BUT THAT HASN'T OPENED YET- AND IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT A LONG WITH THE REGULATIONS AND DC- THERE A COUPLE OF OTHERS THAT ARE ARE LOOKING AT IT IN ILLINOIS WAY THERE'S AN AUTHORIZATION. FOR SPORTS BOOKS TO BE ABLE- TO BE LOCATED AT- AT AN ARENA BUT THEY'RE STILL PRETTY EARLY ON AND THAT PROCESS AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED YET SO- WE'RE SEEING WHERE THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF THAT AND HAVEN'T ACTUALLY. SEEN THAT COME TO FRUITION YET IN THE NBA BUT THERE'S INTEREST. THERE IS INTEREST YES AND A COUPLE OF THINGS IN THE PIPELINE. YEAH EVENTUALLY BASEBALL CURRENT RULES DON'T ALLOW IN GARY IN STADIUMS SPORTS BOOKS- BUT THERE ARE. IN DC AND IN ILLINOIS I EXPECT THAT OUR CLUBS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ABILITY TO- THE ABILITY THAT'S IN THE LAW TO HAVE RETAIL SPORTS BOOKS OUTSIDE THE STADIUM. THANK YOU. OKAY. BECAUSE I WILL QUICKLY GET QUESTION THANK YOU. THE QUESTION ABOUT BRICK AND MORTAR VERSUS MOBILE- ASPECTS OF THE SOLAR INDUSTRY KEEPS COMING UP. AND I GUESS FOR ME THE QUESTION IS- AND MAYBE THE RIGHT PNELIST ANSWER THIS ISSUE OF OVERSIGHT OF AND SECURITY RIGHT OF. THE SCENARIO WAS PRESENTED EARLIER OF PERSON- WALKING IN WITH THE- THE BLACK- SUITCASE IN AND MONEY WALKING AND- TO GAMBLE AND WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE. ABLE TO VIA A MOBILE SOURCE- VERSUS A BRICK AND MORTAR LOCATION TO BE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT- ACCOUNTABILITY OF WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE- MONEY LAUNDERING- DIRTY MONEY AND SO I BECAUSE THE QUESTION BY THE CHAIRMAN KEEPS COMING UP A BRICK AND MORTAR AND- THE MOBILE ASPECTS AND JUST WONDER IF THERE'S A DIFFERENT. ARE THE LEAST UNDER LOOKING AT THAT. FROM OF. TRANSPARENCY AND- ETHICAL YOU KNOW A STANDPOINT- THAT THE INTEGRITY THE WORD INTEGRITY ENOUGH I'M JUST WONDERING IF MAYBE THE RIGHT PANELISTS IT MAY NOT BUT I MEAN KEEP RAISING THE QUESTION ABOUT BRICK AND MORTAR AND THE NEED FOR THIS TO WORK IS TO BE A MOBILE COMPONENT. TO THIS. YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF ON THE RIGHT PANEL SPIN OFF ANTHRAX RIGHT. THERE I USED TO PROSECUTE MONEY LAUNDERING CASES SO I'LL MAYBE TRY TO PUT ON THAT HAVE A LITTLE BIT BUT- I THINK. I THINK IT MAY DEPEND ON THIS. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS IN AT LEAST SOME STATES IF YOU BAT IN A SPORTS BOOK ON MUCH BENDING OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS- SOMETIMES YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO PROVIDE YOUR ID. OR CORE FILL OUT FORMS- AND AGAIN I'M THE GAME INDUSTRY SELF WRONG THEN I'M SURE THEY'LL TELL ME AFTERWARD BUT THAT'S FINE SO. ANYTHING OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU WOULD HAVE TO LIKE FIVE GUYS BACK THERE'SA NOTED THERE HAD YEAH THAT. SO THAT THEY CAN BOB BUT- I DO THINK WITH WITH A MORE WILL. TELL YOU THIS THE WITH A MOBILE PRODUCT TO ME YOU ARE SIGNING UP YEAH YOU KNOW WITH YOUR NAME. YOUR IDENTIFIERS AND SAID SO. I THINK IT THE SHIELD LAUNDRY THROUGH A LEGAL REGULATED. GLOBAL MARKET IS MUCH LOWER ATTENTIONAL UNDERSINK THROUGH BURKE MORE. I WAS THAT I. IT AT THE- CORNER. WHO IS. SAID THAT YOU KNOW THE- GATE AT FIVE HUNDRED OR THOUSAND AS THEIR OWN INTERNAL CUT OFF YOU KNOW WHAT. THE BIGGER BETTER THAN TAT AND SOMEONE THEY DON'T KNOW THEN THEY'RE GONNA ASK FOR ID YEAR CARD OR WHATEVER AND THAT'S GREAT I LIKE TO HEAR THAT KIND OF THING. AND YOU KNOW THE- THE GOOD OPERATORS ARE GOING TO. BE ON TOP OF THE THINGS THAT BRING TO. MIND WITH OUR INTERESTS A LOT OF WHAT. THE REASON WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE TYPES OF THINGS- YOU KNOW THE- TYPE PROTECTIONS THAT THE- BRIAN WAS DESCRIBING IS NOT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT. THE BEST OPERATORS ARE GOING TO DO THOSE THINGS ANYWAY IT'S BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL. AS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE ARE CHOOSING TO WHAT ARE THE MORE AGGRESSIVE- MANAGER. KNOWS WHERE WHAT WE- NEED TO BE SOME CONSISTENT STANDARD. WHAT I'M NOT. AWARE I THINK. I'D LIKE TO. CONTINUE TO LOOK AT A LOOK TO SEE A LOW. BURKE YOU KNOW REGULATORY THRESHOLD FOR ONE- MEAN ID HAS TO BE TAKEN OUR IDENTITY DISCLOSED. THANK YOU. SURE IN THE PAST HOW THE DIFFERENT SPORTS LEAGUES DEALT WITH THE LEGAL OFFSHORE SPORTSBOOK OPERATORS IN THE NAME INTEGRITY. NINE THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE HAVE SOMETHING WE DON'T HAVE REALLY ANY CONTACT WITH THOSE FOLKS- THEY CERTAINLY DON'T REACH OUT TO US- WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO MANDATE COOPERATION FROM THEM- REALLY GET ANYTHING. FROM THEM TO HELP WITH INTEGRITY. AYE AYE THE ONLY THING THAT WE REALLY CAN DO IS THIS IS ONGOING IS TO HELP. AT LEAST EDUCATE OUR PERSONNEL AND BUSINESS PARTNERS ON. YOURS WHO'S LICENSED AND REGULATED AND HERE'S WHO'S NOT SO YOU KNOW IF YOU AVOID THESE OFFSHORE COMPANIES THEY'RE ILLEGAL ON PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT THE INNOCENTLY JUST SEE AN AD. OR THE SYSTEM YOU TO DO A SEARCH YOU KNOW HOW MY PLACE A BET ON THE NBA AND YOU KNOW YOU'LL GET A BUNCH OF SITES THAT COME UP THAT ARE ILLEGAL OFFSHORE SITES AND THOSE GO UP IN THEIR CREDIT CARD AND ALL WORKS IN. THE PRE SPLIT AFTER WHAT. AND THERE YET SO PART OF WILL. TRY TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD. ONES ARE LICENSED IN OUR INNER GOODNESS YOU'RE GONNA DO IT YOU SHOULD USE THOSE AND DON'T. HERE'S WHAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE USING. GIVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE PERSON IS A FRAUD OUT THERE IS. YOU GUYS HAVE ANY IDEA I'M NOT A I'M NOT JUST TALKING SOLELY OFF SHORE BUT JUST IN GENERAL. GIVE ME FRAUD IN TERMS OF THAT BETTING THAT IDEA BUILDING AND I DON'T. OKAY ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS MEMBERS. SEEING NONE THANK YOU GENERAL VIEW TESTIMONY WILL CERTAINLY BE IN TOUCH AS THE COMMITTEE- SCORE OVER THIS ISSUE OF A CLAIM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AT THIS TIME MEMBERS WERE TOO WELL PUBLIC COMMENT WELCOME. ONE TWO THE MICROPHONE HERE. I SEE WE HAVE SOMEONE PROCEED SIR. THE AREA OKAY- GOOD AFTERNOON- MY NAME IS JOHN LEVEL I'M A LOBBYIST TO THE CAPITAL I REPRESENT- PLAYERS- POKER CLUB HE AND- VENTURA I'VE ALSO FOR THE LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS REPRESENTED VARIOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS OF THE CAPITAL I WANT TO COMMANDED THE COMMITTEE FOR ONE OF THE MOST- INFORMATIVE HEARINGS THAT I HAVE SEEN IN THE THIRTY FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE- BUT I THINK WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. IS THE MESSAGE THAT. THE SIXTY THE ANTI AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE OF THE SPORTS BETTING MARKET HAS TO BE MOVED UNDER A REGULATORY AEGIS- AND THE FAILURE TO DO THAT- WOULD BE- CATASTROPHIC QUITE FRANKLY- IN MANY WAYS THE PROPOSED BALLOT MEASURE THAT'S BEING PENDING HAS SIT BACK AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYER SHINS OF ONCE- THE OTHER THING I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT THE COMMITTEE- REALLY CONSIDER THE TESTIMONY OF ON THE- FIRST- WITNESS MISTER WALLACE. ABOUT REALLY IT I THINK POINTS THE WAY FOR WHAT. THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS LEGISLATURE CAN DO WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE STEPS OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT PERHAPS WE CAN ENACT A COMPREHENSIVE ALL INCLUSIVE SPORTS BETTING MODEL THAT BRINGS. THAT MARKET INTO UNDER A REGULATORY AEGIS I WOULD JUST COMMEND THAT FOR YOUR FOR YOUR THINKING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIRMAN DODD AND CHAIRMAN GRAY- MY NAME IS CHESTER FIAMMA THE CHAIR OF THE CALYX PO IN STATE FAIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING TO LIGHT THIS POPULAR SUBJECT- SPORTS WAGERING IS A- IS POPULAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT IS DEFINITELY POPULAR AT CAL EXPO. AS WE HAVE BEEN- ACCEPTING WAGERING ON HORSE RACES SINCE THE CALIFORNIA STATE FAIR STARTED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR ON BEHALF OF OUR BOARD I WANT TO STATE OUR SUPPORT FOR SPORTS WAGERING PROVIDED THAT RACING FAIRS ARE INCLUDED- THE STATE FAIR HAS A PROVEN AND SAFE RECORD AS A WAGERING FACILITY WE PROVIDE EXPOSURE TO MORE THAN TWO MILLION PEOPLE. ATTENDING EVENTS AT CAL EXPO EACH YEAR THEY'RE ALREADY A LIFE IN STE AND CLOSELY REGULATED GAMING FACILITY. CALYX SPOKE CURRENT HANDLES RIGHT THE ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND WAGERS INCLUDING PARKS RAISING STATE FAIR BRACING AND SATELLITE DURING THE WAGERING REP GENERATED AT OUR FACILITY SUPPORTS OUR STATE FAIR AND CAN. STILL WORRIES. WHO ARE THE FOUR DIFFERENT BANDS. AS UNDER RACING FAIRS SCOOTED FROM THE CURRENTLY PROPOSED TO STATE WAGERING INITIATIVE WE WILL BE OPPOSING IT SHOULD IT MOVED TO THE BALLOT. AND HOPE THE LEGISLATURE CAN OFFER A BETTER ALTERNATIVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN THAT GERMAN GRAY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LARRY SWARTS LANDER I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA THIRTY RACING FAIRS KILEY NOTICE CARVE UP WE HAVE THIRTEEN NUMBER AFFAIRS WHICH TO HAVE SATELLITES THAT THEIR OPERATE YEAR ROUND IN FOUR OF THOSE FACILITIES ARE OPERATE LIVE RACING AND YOUR CONDUCT LIVE RACING FROM MID JUNE TO MID OCTOBER AND I WAS A CAL EXPO IS ONE OF OUR MEMBERS. WE% STRONGLY SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION OF SPORTS WAGERING IN CALIFORNIA AS LONG AS STATE DESIGNATED RAISING FARES ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. IS IMPAIR THE SPORTS WAGERING BE CONDUCTED IN A MANNER THAT PRIORITIZES THE INTEGRITY OF THE SPORTING EVENT. RAISES REVENUE FOR THE STATE ENSURES THE STATE THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC. CALIFORNIA'S RAISING FARES BEEN SAFELY SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THIS SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY THREE. AND AS A RESULT WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT IS THE STATE THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST TO ALLOW US TO OFFER SPORTS WAGERING IN OUR LIFE SO THESE AND SATELLITE FACILITIES. STATE DESIGNATED RAISING FARES ARE REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AGRICULTURE. IN THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD. ALL KIND OF MEMBER MEETINGS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT OPEN MEETING LAWS PUBLIC RECORD REQUEST STATE AUDITS ARE GOVERNED BY LOCALLY APPOINTED INDIVIDUALS. CONSEQUENTLY THEY'RE NOT A SAFER AND MORE REGULATED LOCATION FOR THE PUBLIC TO PLACE A WAGER IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS GLENN FELDMAN- ALTHOUGH I'M IN ARIZONA LAWYER- I'VE BEEN PRETTY ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN TRIBAL GAMING IN CALIFORNIA FOR QUITE A LONG TIME AND I DON'T KNOW MISTER WALLICH BUT I DID TELL HIM THAT I WAS GONNA MAKE A COMMENT ON SOME OF THE TESTIMONY HE MADE EARLIER TODAY- I THINK MISTER WALKS TESTIMONY WAS THAT HE WAS 1100% CONVINCED THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO AUTHORIZE SPORTS BETTING. THROUGH SIMPLE LEGISLATION AND THAT THE CONSTITUTION AND THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WAS NOT AN IMPEDIMENT TO DOING THAT. UP I'M NOT PREPARED TO SAY THAT MISTER IS WRONG IN THAT OPINION. BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT IT IS CONTRARY TO THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM OF MOST LAWYERS WHO HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH GAMING ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE LAST. TWENTY OR THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS- SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE- RUSHES TO ENACT LEGISLATION TO AUTHORIZE SPORTS BETTING. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU HAVE YOUR LAWYERS LOOK AT THAT ISSUE PRETTY CAREFULLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT ISSUE IS QUITE A BIT MORE NUANCED AND QUITE A BIT MORE COMPLEX THE MAY HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS HEARING HE WAS VERY INFORMATIVE MY NAME IS REALLY BERMUDA'S ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA CITIES GAMINE AUTHORITY A JPA.

RESIDENTS TO PARTICIPATE.
