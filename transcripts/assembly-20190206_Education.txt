STUDENTS STAFF AND FAMILIES WERE LITERALLY RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES AS A FIRESTORM RAIN DOWN UPON OUR TOWN. WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE CAMPFIRE VERY QUICKLY BECAME ONE LARGE HORRIFIC INFERNO? DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH AT THE SPEED OF A FOOTBALL FIELD LENGTH. A SECOND. COMMUNICATION WAS OFF WITHIN MINUTES. AND FOR SURE IN FOUR SHORT HOURS THERE WERE TREMENDOUS ACTS OF SELFLESS COURAGE AND DEDICATION. AS OUR STAFF MOBILIZED EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLANS THAT VERY QUICKLY ESCALATED INTO A MAD DASH TO GET PEOPLE TO SAFETY.

PRIOR TO NOVEMBER EIGHTH GRADE SCHOOL DISTRICT INCLUDED NINE CAMPUSES. OVER FOUR HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND A BUSTLING INFRASTRUCTURE OF FOOD SERVICES MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS AND TRANSPORTATION.

LAST WEEK I WAS TOLD BY OUR TOWN MANAGER THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE SINGLE PROPERTY PARADISE. THAT DID NOT HAVE SOME SORT OF BURN ON IT. WE HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMED AND HUMBLED BY THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT AND LOVE WE RECEIVE FROM ARE FELLOW EDUCATORS FROM ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. IT IS OUR GREAT DESIRE TO IT SOME TIME PAID THIS KIND IS FOR TO OTHERS WHO MAY FIND HIMSELF IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS. SO WHAT DO WE NEED FROM YOU.

OUR STUDENTS NEED AND DESERVE THIS. CLEESE BE PART OF THE HELP THAT OUR STUDENTS DESERVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JOHN WILL NOW HEAR FROM A TEACHER FROM THE SCENE OF YOU PARRIS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT DAVID SMITH MISTER SMITH. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION. THANK YOU FOR GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DESCRIBE MY EXPERIENCE THE CAMPFIRE. NAME IS DAVID SMITH I'M A MATH TEACHER AT THE CONTINUATION SCHOOL RIDGEVIEW HIGH SCHOOL IN PARADISE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION OF PARADISE. HERE A FEW PICTURES OF MY CLASSROOM WHERE I TAUGHT MATH FOUNDATIONS FINANCIAL LITERACY AND INTEGRATED MATH. REGGIE WITH THE RESCUE RANGERS A CLASS THAT DOES A LOT OF COMMUNITY SERVICE ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT BUTTE COUNTY. THAT ALL CHANGED ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH. WHEN I GOT TO RICH VIEW SPOT FIRE STARTED COMING OVER THE RIDGE FROM CON CAL? MY PRINCIPAL WAS ALREADY SENDING PARENTS WAY WITH THEIR CHILDREN. MY PRINCIPAL AND I CENTER CO WORKERS HOME TO BE BACK WITH THEIR FAMILIES MAKE SURE ALL OUR STUDENTS WERE EVACUATED AND WERE THE LAST ONES TO LEVERAGE AT NINE O'CLOCK. THE THIRTY FIVE MINUTE DRIVE TO ORVILLE TURN INTO A FIVE AND A HALF HOUR HORRIFYING TRAFFIC JAM FILLED FLEE. FROM WHAT FELT LIKE AN ERUPTING VOLCANO. TWICE SO STUCK IN TRAFFIC SO CLOSE TO THE FIRE SORRY. THAT I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE TO ABANDON MY TRUCK. DURING THE WHOLE EVACUATION MY ADRENALINE WAS RACING AND ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT. WAS TO GET HOME TO MY FAMILY IN CHICO WE'RE RIGHT WHERE IT WAS SAFE. I CAN IMAGINE WITH THOSE WHO ARE FLEEING FROM THEIR HOMES WITH THINKING. ONCE OFF THE HILL. ARE UNION MEMBERS STARTED CALLING TO MAKE SURE TEACHERS WERE SAFE. AT THE SAME TIME TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS CALLED FAMILIES TO REUNITE THEM WITH THEIR STUDENTS. AND MAKE SURE ALL OUR STUDENTS WERE COUNTED. FOR AS YOU KNOW BY THE GRACE OF GOD. ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF WERE SAFELY EVACUATED. MOST MEMBERS FOR THE RELATIVES OR FRIENDS WHO COULD TAKE THEM AND SOME TEACHERS. LANDED AS FAR AWAY AS WASHINGTON OREGON NEVADA AND EVEN KANSAS. OVER THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION MEMBERS WHO LIVED OR WORKED IN THE FIRE BRIMSTONE HAVE ENTERED AN APPLICATION FOR CTA DISASTER RELIEF GRANTS. ACCORDING TO OUR TEACHERS ASSOCIATION SURVEY A HUNDRED AND SEVEN OF FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO TEACHERS WERE DISPLACED. SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE LOST THEIR HOMES. SINCE THE FIRE OF GATHERED AND DISTRIBUTED DONATIONS AND INFORMATION IN ORDER TO ANSWER MY MEMBERS QUESTIONS. ALONG WITH PROVIDE SUPPORT AND REASSURANCE TO MY FELLOW COWORKERS. THE BIGGEST ISSUE HAS BEEN FINDING HOUSING FOR THOSE WHO WERE DISPLACED. MANY TEACHERS ARE LIVING IN TRAILERS ARE SHARING HOMES WITH FRIENDS OR FAMILY WHILE WAITING TO REBUILD. HOUSING IS STILL DIFFICULT TO FIND A FEW COUNTY NOT ONLY AFFECTING THOSE DISPLACED BUT ALSO ANY BUSINESSES TRYING TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES. MY DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS. HAVE IN AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT JOB TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REBUILD A SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM ALMOST NOTHING. INCLUDING SEARCHING FOR LARGE ENOUGH FACILITIES FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF. THE NO FAULT OF OUR DISTRICT COMMUNICATION WAS LIMITED DUE TO SO MANY UNKNOWNS. SO I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF AS PRESIDENT TO BE THE LIAISON BETWEEN THE DISTRICT OFFICE AND MY TEACHERS. IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS PEOPLE WERE FILLED WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. AND THE BIGGEST CAUSE OF ANXIETY IS WHETHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO STILL HAVE THEIR JOBS. WITHOUT A CLEAR BUDGET IN PLACE. OUR DISTRICT WAS INITIALLY HESITANT TO STATE THE JOBS OR SAFETY ON NOVEMBER. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE UNINTENTIONALLY CAUSED UNDUE STRESS AND TREPIDATION. RECENTLY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS WORKED WITH OUR ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT BUSINESS SERVICES ON P. WESTIES BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR. THAT'S IT APPEARS WE CAN AVOID MASSIVE LAYOFFS SO SOON AFTER THE DISASTER. HOWEVER BEYOND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY THE BUDGET IS STILL UNKNOWN AND FILLS MY TEACHERS WITH DREAD WONDERING IF OR WHEN THEY'LL HAVE TO SEARCH FOR NEW JOBS AND LEAVE PARADISE. I BELIEVE HAVING DISASTER PLAN THAT INCLUDED PRE FIRE EIGHTY A FUNDING FOR MULTIPLE YEARS DEPENDING ON THE ENORMITY OF THE DISASTER. AND PORTABLE CLASSROOMS FOR SCHOOLS THAT WERE DESTROYED WOULD BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL FOR ADMINISTRATORS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES WHEN FACED WITH THE DISASTER SUCH AS THE CAMPFIRE. THE IMPACT OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER ON FIRE VICTIMS HAS BEEN CLEARLY EVIDENT. PEOPLE HAVE DIFFICULTY SLEEPING OR NIGHTMARES ABOUT THE FIRE. HIGHER BRAIN MAKES CONCENTRATING OR MAKING DECISIONS VERY CHALLENGING. DO THE UNCONVENTIONAL CLASSROOMS HIGH VOLUME LEVELS OF BECAUSE STUDENT OUTBURSTS. AND TEACHERS NEED TO TAKE MENTAL BREAKS. STAFFER EMOTIONALLY DRAINED AND DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY AFTER SCHOOL TO MAKE PHONE CALLS TO TRY TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER. DRIVING TO THE DEVASTATION TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO STUDENTS IN THE GALLEY IN DECEMBER. BECAUSE TWO OF OUR TEACHERS TO RESIGN AND TWO OTHERS TO GO OUT ON DISABILITY LEAVE. PEOPLE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE FIRE IN THE TIME. MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT AND POSITIVE ENCOURAGEMENT IN ORDER TO RECOVER. I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN REDDING CALIFORNIA. AND LAST JULY MY LONG TIME FRIEND WHO NOW LIVES IN LAKE COUNTY CAME TO STAY WITH ME BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN BACK WHEN FOR THE MEDICINE A COMPLEX FIRE. HE COULDN'T GO BACK TO READING BECAUSE HIS PARENTS WERE DISPLACED TO THE CAR FIRE IT'S TIME. EVERY MORNING AND EVENING WE WOULD WATCH THE TELEVISION COVERAGE WAITING TO HEAR ENCOURAGING NEWS BOTH FIRES. AND I REMEMBER THINKING HOW SAD I WAS WATCHING THE CITY I GREW UP IN. FOR MANY OF MY FRIENDS TO LIVE. GOING UP IN FLAMES. BUT THAT SADNESS WAS FLEETING. AND I WOULDN'T THINK ABOUT IT WELL I WENT ABOUT MY DAY HOWEVER. AFTER EXPERIENCING THE CAMPFIRE. I TRULY UNDERSTAND THE DRAMATIC IMPACT OF THIS ACT LIKE THIS HAS ON PEOPLE. THERE IS NO FORGETTING ABOUT IT DURING THE DAY. I THINK ABOUT THE FIRE SORRY. OR ITS IMPACT OF MY COMMUNITY CONSTANTLY. AND IT'S HARD TO SHUT OFF. THIS CATASTROPHE IS TURN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE'S LIVES UPSIDE DOWN. AND I FIND THE COURAGE. AND RESILIENCE OF OUR STUDENTS PARENTS SCHOOL STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS. TRULY AMAZING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I HOPE THIS TESTIMONY HOPES IN SHAPING POLICY THAT WILL BENEFIT SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE RECOVERY FROM FUTURE DISASTERS. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH THANK YOU. OUR NEXT PRESENTER IS ANY ALCINA SUPERINTENDENT PRINCIPLE FROM COLD SPRING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT. IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. GOOD FTERNOON I AM EMAILS IN OF THE SUPERINTENDENT PRINCIPLE OF THE COLD SPRING SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MINUS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IT'S AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE SO THANK YOU. THE COLD SPRING SCHOOL DISTRICT IS A SINGLE ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT BASIC AID. WE HAVE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THROUGH SIXTH GRADE STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT STUDENTS. BASED ON THE MOST RECENT KASPARS CULTURING SCHOOL DISTRICT IS RANKED AMONGST YOUR TOP SCHOOL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH EXCEEDING THE STANDARDS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS. AND 90% OF YOUR STUDENTS AND MATHEMATICS. ON JANUARY EIGHTH. I RECALL IT BEING A VERY BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY AND SECOND GUESSING MY DECISION TO CANCEL SCHOOL. BECAUSE I'D CANCEL SCHOOL SO MANY TIMES FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER DUE TO THE THOMAS FIRE. HI THEY MADE A WRONG DECISION WITH THESE PARENTS FROM THIS HIGH PERFORMING DISTRICTS CERTAINLY CRUCIFY A FRESHMAN SUPERINTENDENT. BUT LO AND BEHOLD. THE NEXT MORNING AT THREE THIRTY IN THE MORNING THE RAINS CAME DOWN. I LOOKED OUTSIDE MY WINDOW MY MINUS YOU DON'T HOME. TO SEE THE LIGHT THE SKY LIT UP. OR INJURED THAN I'D EVER SEEN. I WAS CONFUSED HOW CAN THIS GUY BE RAD. AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVE RAIN COMING DOWN AS HARD AS IT AS IT AS I WENT TO FIND MY CELL PHONE. DAVID HI HAD NO SELF POWER. AND AT THAT TIME A MEMBER AGAIN BEING CONFUSED WAS UNTIL FIVE THIRTY IN THAT NEXT MORNING WARY LEARNED THAT. THIRTY SQUARE MILES AND MINUS YOU KNOW HAD BEEN COVERED WITH MAD DEBRIS AND BOULDERS WHITE BEAN OUT HOMES. TAKING FAMILIES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE OCEAN FROM THEIR HOMES. AND DESTROYING MANY TRAPPED UNDERNEATH THE DEBRIS. WITH MY CELL PHONE IN HAND I MANAGED TO FIND MY WAY AUTUMN HONESTY DOWN. AND CONTACT EACH ONE OF MY STAFF MEMBERS. AND TOGETHER WE CONTACTED ALL OF OUR PARENTS. TO DEFINE THAT MANY OF OUR CHILDREN WERE DAD. JANUARY NINTH WAS EXTREMELY HARD DAY AS A SUPERINTENDENT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE CONTACTING. WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OUR NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS WE CERTAINLY COULD HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT THEM AND AS WELL AS OUR GOVERNANCE BOARD. THE MINUS YOU KNOW COMMUNITY LAST TWENTY THREE PEOPLE TO ARE STILL MISSING TO THIS DAY. OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE PEOPLE WERE CRITICALLY INJURED. NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE RESCUED WITHIN THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS OF THE DEBRIS FLOW. FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN HOMES WERE DESTROYED AND DAMAGED AND THE ONE OH ONE FREEWAY WAS CLOSED FOR TWO WEEKS. DISRUPTING THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A SINGLE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS OFTEN ELOQUENT. TO HANDLE A NATURAL DISASTER LIKE THIS I AM THE SOLE ADMINISTRATOR. AGAIN IF IT WASN'T FOR THE HELP OF OUR NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS WE WOULD NOT OF GOD DO THIS. IN THESE EMERGENCIES DISTRICTS NEED SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF TRAUMA COUNSELING FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF. IMMEDIATE ACCESS FOR FUNDING WHICH INCLUDES THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION SERVICES OUTSIDE THE REGULAR SCHOOL DAY. AND FLEXIBILITY IS OR EXEMPTIONS FROM CURRENT STATE LAW. FORTUNATELY THE CUT COLD SPRING CAMPUS SEVERED MINOR PHYSICAL DAMAGES THAT A NOTIONAL TRAUMA AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. THE WELLNESS SUPPORT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR THE RESTART OF SCHOOL AS WE INSURED EVERY TEACHER WAS EQUIPPED WITH A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST OR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TO SUPPORT NOT ONLY THE TEACHER BUT THE STUDENTS. THESE CONTINUE SERVICES REQUIRE FINDING. AS DO THE SUPPLE AT A SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION SERVICES AND IMMEDIATE FUNDING. DURING THE THOMAS FIRE MUD SLIDES. STUDENTS LOTS THE TOTAL TWELVE DAYS OF INSTRUCTION WHICH IS 10% ALMOST NEARLY 10% OF THE SCHOOL YEAR AND ADDITION WE HAD TO RELOAD OUR CAMPUS SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH BECAUSE OF MANDATORY EVACUATIONS. SHOULD SHE OF THE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES THAT WE RECEIVED. WE HAD TO DO. AND STILL MANY BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL TUTORING FOR OUR STUDENTS. AGAIN THIS COST FUNDING REQUIRES FINDING. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A STORY ABOUT A KINDERGARTEN STUDENT WAS THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER AT COLD SPRING SCHOOL WHOSE MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER WERE WORKING THE NIGHT SHIFT AT THE BOND SUPERMARKET ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY NINTH. AFTER THE MUD SLIDES THEY REALIZE THEY COULD NOT GET TO THEIR HOMES SO THEY SOMEHOW MANAGED TO FIND THEIR WAY TO THE MOTEL. SIX WHERE THE NEXT MORNING THEY WERE GREETED BY THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THAT INFORMED THEM THAT THEIR SIGN A KINDERGARTEN STUDENT. HAD BEEN KILLED AND THAT HIS BODY WAS TAKEN ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE RAILROAD TRACKS. HIS FATHER WAS KILLED AND HIS GRAN. THIS FAMILY WAS OUR HER OUTLOOK FAMILY AND OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY. IT'S THEY STILL LEAVE A WHOLE. THE PAST OF THE STORY OF PASTA REPRESENTS THE CHIU NATURE WHAT A DISASTER LIKE THIS MEANS TO THE COMMUNITY. OUR RECOVERY EFFORTS ARE ONGOING. OUR COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE THE AFTER EFFECTS OF THE THOMAS A BUYER WITH REPEATED EVACUATIONS THAT EVEN JUST OCCURRED THIS LAST WEEKEND. NEW DEBRIS FLOWS AND EGGS IT AFTER EACH RAINSTORM OCCUR. BUT ON JANUARY NINTH OF THIS YEAR WE COMMEMORATED THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEADLY DEBRIS FLOW BY HOLDING A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL AND PER SESSION TO REMEMBER THE TWENTY THREE MINUS YOU TO RESIDENTS THAT WERE KILLED. NEARLY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE OF ALL AGES ATTENDED THE CEREMONY WERE BOTH PRIVATE. AND PUBLIC MINUS YOU TO CHILDREN CAME TOGETHER TO SING THIS LITTLE LIGHT OF MINE. BEFORE FALLING EACH HEAD OF SCHOOL DURING A CANDLELIGHT PROCESSION REPRESENTING LIVE AND HOPE FOR OUR FUTURE. I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT OUR COLLABORATIVE ACTS AS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS.

MANY OF OUR STUDENTS LIVED IN THAT AREA. HAS THE SUN REYES ROSE WE REALIZED HOW MUCH OF OUR CITY HAD BEEN AFFECTED. HOW MANY OF OUR FRIENDS AND STUDENTS LOST THEIR HOUSES? AS THE STORIES TRICKLED IN WE WERE HORRIFIED ABOUT THE DEVASTATION. GOING BACK TO SCHOOL I WANTED IT TO BE AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE SO I PUT MY MAKE UPON MY HIGH HEELS AND I DID MY HAIR JUST LIKE BEFORE. SO WHEN THE STUDENTS ABOUT IN THE CLASSROOM I LOOK NORMAL.

WITH REBUILDING TAKING SO LONG OUR STUDENTS ARE FORCED TO RELOCATE AS THE PROJECTED DATE OF THEIR REBUILT HOUSE IS PUSHED FURTHER OUT. MANY FAMILIES ARE FACED WITH HAVING TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE AND THEIR READ AT THE SAME TIME. THIS IS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT REBUILDING PERIOD.

WE LIKE TO ALSO PUT OUT AN INVITATION THAT WE'VE CREATED -- TO DO A TRAINING IN A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- IN FOR EDUCATORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ON HOW TO PREPARE AND RESPOND TO DISASTERS WERE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL HOST THAT. ON MARCH THE SIX IT'S OPEN TO ANY WE WELCOME PARTNERSHIP FROM THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE -- FROM THE ASSEMBLY -- THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE HELP OUR FAMILIES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE -- AGAIN MY NAME IS JUANITA ELLIS I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL FACILITIES AND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES DIVISION. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. OUR ROLE IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DRAMATICALLY INCREASE IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOW BY NO WAY ARE WE TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE DISASTERS THAT HAPPENED BEFORE. BUT IT WASN'T TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WE BAN BEGAN SEEN A NEW KIND OF NORMAL FOR CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES. WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IMPACTED OUR SCHOOLS OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STAFF. BECAUSE OF THESE IMPACTS WE DEVELOPED A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN OUR SUPPORT TO ELLIE AIDS. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE TOTAL STATEWIDE IMPACTS SINCE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WERE TWELVE SCHOOLS THAT WERE DESTROYED BY THE WILDFIRES THIS INCLUDES PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. WE ALSO HAD AN ADDITIONAL FOURTEEN SCHOOLS THAT WERE DAMAGED AGAIN INCLUDES PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. OVER SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS LOST THEIR HOMES. OVER EIGHT HUNDRED STAFF LOST THEIR HOMES. AGAIN THIS INFORMATION IS FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO PRESENT. NOW IN OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS WAS OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE IN LONG TERM ACTIVATION OF CD REPRESENTATIVES. AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER WHICH IS HOUSE AT THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES HEADQUARTERS. AND AND QUITE FRANKLY WE WERE NOT WELL PREPARED. WE WE HAD TO QUICKLY. LEARN AND GET UP TO SPEED ON THE EMERGEN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. WE HAD TO GET USED TO THE THE THE SOCK SCHEDULES REPORTS WE LEARNED A LOT. WE LEARNED A LOT FROM OUR COLLEAGUES AT CALLAWAY YES AND I THINK LIKEWISE THEY LEARN A LOT FROM SUMMATION ABOUT SCHOOL CLOSURES. OF THE NUMBER STUDENTS DISPLACED AND IMPACTS THE SCHOOL FACILITIES. IN THIS WAS CHALLENGING -- IT WAS CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT IT WENT AGAINST THE NATURAL FLOW OF INFORMATION. NOW FIRST OF ALL THERE WERE ARE NO REQUIREMENTS ARE STANDARD PROCEDURES FOR ELLIE ETS TO REPORT SCHOOL CLOSURES TO CD IN REAL TIME -- SECOND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR WAS IN NATURE LOCAL. BECAUSE WE WERE LOOKING FOR INFORMATION THAT WAS FROM INSIDE AND IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE BURNS OWNS. WE SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE A WAY TO GET THIS INFORMATION UNLESS WE RECEIVED A DIRECTLY FROM SCHOOL LEADERS -- OR FIRST RESPONDERS. AND IF YOU WERE ACTIVE IN THE RESPONSE FACE WE DEVELOPED A VERY STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH CALLAWAY YES. SINCE SCHOOLS WHERE PRIORITY NOT JUST FOR OUR DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THIS LED TO CITIES FIRST PARTICIPATION IN THE UNIFIED COORDINATION GROUP. WHICH IS MADE UP OF HIGH LEVEL STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS. AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE SCHOOLS TASK FORCE -- JOINTLY LED BY OUR OFFICE AND CAL YES. IN THIS TASK FORCE BASICALLY PROVIDED A COLLABORATIVE FORUM FOR STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES TO PRIORITIZE EFFECTIVE RESPONSE ACTIVITIES ON BEHALF OF THE IMPACT THAT ELLIE ACE. AND WE HAD SOME SOME RESULTING SUCCESSES FROM THE STATE'S WAS TASK FORCE -- FOR EXAMPLE THE CREATION AND DISSEMINATION WHILE FIVE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS THAT WERE SPECIFIC TO SCHOOLS. WE DEVELOPED THAT WE PUT HER ON A WEBSITE -- PERON CALLOW YES IS WEBSITE. WE ALSO ESTABLISH A DEPLOYED. AN INTERAGENCY SCHOOL ASSESSMENT TEAM. THAT WAS LED BY OUR DEPARTMENT TO HELP THE SCHOOLS THAT WERE DAMAGED OR DESTROYED BUT BUT THEY WERE NEAR -- NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE DESTROYED BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON WHAT TO DO TO REOPEN SCHOOLS. THERE WAS NO STATE. LAWS REGULATION TOGETHER IT SEEMED OR GO OUT THERE AND TRY AND HELP THEM -- THIS ALSO RESULT IN COLLABORATION TO ISSUE A GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. THAT CREATED FOR CIVILIAN SECURITY FOR IMPACTED ELLIE ACE. AND WE ALSO SUPPORTED THE CINEMA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IN CONVENING A LOCAL SCHOOLS TASK FORCE. SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE THE STATE BUT THIS IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. RECORDED DAILY WITH A SCHOOL LIAISON THAT WAS EMBEDDED IN THE COUNTY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER -- AND THERE WERE THERE ON BEHALF OF THE CINEMA COUNTY SCHOOLS. SOMETHING THAT WE LEARN FROM THIS WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING. A SCHOOL LIAISONS REPRESENTED DAILY AT THE COUNTY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER. THIS ADDRESSES THE FLOW OF INFORMATION THAT GOES FROM THE LOCALS TO THE COUNTY TO THE STATE. AND INSURERS AND EDUCATION VOICE IS AT THE TABLE. THROUGHOUT THE PER SPONSOR PROCESS AND TO ADDRESS ANY ON THAT NEEDS. NOW WHILE ACTIVITIES CONTINUED IN THE FIELD OFFICE CITY WORKED WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY AND SECURE FUNDING FOR SEVERAL GRANTS -- SOMEBODY'S GRANTS OR THE PROJECT SERVE WHICH IS A SCHOOL EMERGENCY RESPONSE OF ISLANDS THE RESTART PROGRAM. WHICH IS A AID TO RESTART SCHOOL OPERATIONS THE EMERGENCY IMPACT AID AND ASSISTANCE FOR HOMELESS CHILDREN AND YOUTH. NOW AS A RESULT OF THE GREAT WORK FROM OUR FORMER FEDERAL LIAISON WHO IS NOW PART OF YOUR COMMITTEE THINKING -- CALIFORNIA WAS ABLE TO APPLY SECURED NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO ASSIST ELEAZAR. AYE WITH REBUILDING STUDENT TRANSPORTATION COUNSELING TEMPERATE FACILITIES AND MORE. THESE FUNDS ARE USED TO SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE AND FOR YOU MY PUBLIC ASSISTANT DOLLARS TO ADDRESS ELEAZAR UNMET NEEDS. NOW SHORTLY AFTER THE OCTOBER INCIDENT WAS STABILIZED. THEN THE THOMAS FIRE MOST OTHERS RAVAGED SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. LATER ON THAT MONTH. WE HAD TO WANT TO SEE THE MUD SLIDES WHICH WE HEARD ABOUT EARLIER. AND THIS CREATED A WHOLE NEW SET OF TASKS AROUND WORKING WITH IMPACTED ELLIE ETS TO A JENNIFER I OPTIONS FOR AN ARM HELLSING. AND TEMPORARY SITE LOCATIONS. OUR INFORMATION GATHERING SAPPORO REMAIN LARGELY THE SAME. BUT WE WERE ABLE TO WORK MORE QUICKLY. TO CONNECT IMPACTED ELLIE ACE TO THE RESOURCES. THEY WOULD GET TO THE JULY AUGUST WILDFIRES THAT IN SOME CASES DEVASTATED COUNTRIES THAT WERE IMPACTED THE YEAR BEFORE. DURING THESE FIRES THE EDUCATION LEADERS AFFECTED BY THE ACT OF MERCY THEY HAD THE BENEFIT OF LEARNING FROM THEIR PEERS. WHO HAD BEEN THROUGH THE SAME THING? WE WOULD LIKE -- TO THINK DOCTOR STEVEN PARENTING IN PARTICULAR FOR THE EXPERTISE HE HAS LED TO FELLOW COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. AND THEN MOST RECENTLY. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CAMPFIRE RESULT IN A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF RESPONSE AT THE STATE LEVEL. THE CITY TEAM DREW UPON THEIR PAST EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO BE DILIGENTLY PROACTIVE ABOUT IDENTIFIED I'M AT LOCAL NEEDS. AND WE DID HAVE SOME SUCCESSES -- IN THIS EFFORT. WE ONCE AGAIN RESUMED THE STATE'S SCHOOLS TASK FORCE -- AGAIN BEING CALLED LED BY OUR PARTNERS AND OURSELVES I CAL YES. WE DEPLOYED A TEAM OF CD EXPERTS. TO HELP THE BUTTE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IS EDUCATION SUMMIT. WE ALSO HELP IN SECURING AND ORGANIZING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL VOLUNTEERS -- TO HELP STUDENTS TO AS A RETURN TO SCHOOL -- THIS ALSO RESULT IN COLLABORATION WITH CALLAWAY YES AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO SECURE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS. THAT MET LOCAL NEEDS SUCH AS BEING ABLE TO USE TEMPORARY FACILITIES. NOW THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE WILD FIRES RESPONSE. WE HAVE BOLSTERED ON MY GUIDANCE AND ARE RICHER FOR SILLY ETS IMPACTED BY THE WILDFIRES. PROVIDING INFORMATION ON ATTENDANCE AND FUNDING FOOD DISTRIBUTION CONGREGATE FEEDING -- ANTS SCHOOL FACILITIES SOLUTIONS BUT UNDERSTAND THE LOCAL NEEDS AND TAKEN ACTION TO SUPPORT THE LA ACE. NOW WHILE INTERAGENCY COLLABORATION CORONATION HAS GROWN TREMENDOUSLY -- AND LET TO FOUNDATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS WE STILL FACE SOME PERSISTENT CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO THE TASK OF SUPPORTING. SOME OF THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS BETTER OUT ONE CALIFORNIA STATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN. WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN HELPING ELEAZAR DURING THE RESPONSE OF RECOVERY. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN HELPING ELLIE ACE PREPARE FOR EMERGENCIES -- AS A STATES INTERACTION WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK DILIGENTLY TO SUPPORT ELEAZAR THEIR WITH THAT WE CAN. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH CAROL YES ANOTHER AGENCIES. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- TO RESOURCES SOLUTIONS THAT WILL WORK FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT. REPEAT SOME OF WHAT -- THE SUPERINTENDENT AND AND ONE TOUCHED ON BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE DON'T WITH STATEWIDE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WHAT OUR ROLE IS AND CAL WE*. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CERTAINLY EXPECT IS AHEAD OF US -- UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS YEAR AS WELL TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS A REAL ROSA. WE THOUGHT WAS A REMARKABLE YEAR IT WAS BOOKENDED. BY TWO OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EVENTS THAT WE DEALT WITH AND DECADE STUCK -- SIGNIFICANT FLOODING IN THE EARLY PART -- THE LARGEST NON HURRICANE EVACUATION IN U. S. HISTORY -- FOLLOWING THE EMERGENCY -- AT LAKE OR A BILL AT THE END OF THAT YEAR WE DEALT WITH WHAT WE BELIEVED WAS -- NOT TO BE SURPASSED -- IN MANY MANY YEARS -- WHICH AT THE TIME WAS THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES ACROSS SEVEN COUNTIES FOURTEEN FIRES THAT ALL STARTED ON OCTOBER EIGHTH AND DEVASTATED -- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS ONE INDICATED -- FOLLOWED BY THE THOMAS FIRE. SO AS WE GOT INTO. TWENTY EIGHTEEN A WE WERE FACED UNFORTUNATELY -- WITH ANOTHER SERIES OF CATASTROPHIC DISASTERS IN TOTAL ACROSS. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WERE SIXTEEN PROP GOVERNOR'S PROCLAMATIONS OF EMERGENCIES. INCLUDED IN THERE -- WERE THREE A PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECORATIONS MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATIONS. OF CALIFORNIA ALSO RECEIVED TWELVE FIRE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE GRANTS WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THAT ARE THOSE WERE TWELVE INCIDENTS WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO TRY TO AVOID. HAVING A CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THOSE FIRES DID BECOME SIGNIFICANT EVENTS THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE MINUS SEAT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED SIGNIFICANT FIRES. THROUGHOUT ALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN OF THOSE REQUIRED US TO ACTIVATE THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER. AS HAS BEEN NOTED EARLIER THAT IS THE LOCATION WHERE WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MOBILIZING STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE IMPACTED. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CAR FIRE IN SHASTA AND TRINITY COUNTIES -- INCLUDED A CAP THREE FIRE NATO A SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED PREVIOUSLY WITH A HUNDRED FORTY MILE FORTY THREE MILE AN HOUR WINDS DRIVING THAT FIRE. THAT WAS A FIRE THAT NIGHT WE BELIEVE THAT WAS LIKELY GOING TO RUN -- TO INTERSTATE FIVE BUT FORTUNATELY FIRE CREWS WERE ABLE TO DO REMARKABLE WORK AND STOP IT BEFORE IT DEVASTATED -- THE CITY OF READING WE HAD THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX FIRE A SERIES OF FIRES THAT CAME TOGETHER AND COLUSA GLENN LAKE AND MENDOCINO COUNTIES. ULTIMATELY -- THOSE -- BECAME THE LARGEST FIRE SURPASSING THE THOMAS FIRE FROM JUST MONTHS PREVIOUS TO THAT. AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS WE'RE ALL WELL AWARE WE EXPERIENCE THE CAMPFIRE AND BUTTE THE HILL FIRED VENTURE ON THE WALLS THE FIRE IN LOS ANGELES. ALL TOLD. WE LOST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX CALIFORNIANS DURING THE FIRES AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NEARLY TWO MILLION ACRES WERE DESTROYED. AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND STRUCTURES WERE DESTROYED -- INCLUDING SEVERAL OF OUR CRITICAL SCHOOLS IN THE CAMP FIRE SO WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES UNDER THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT OF MOBILIZING. STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT AND WE DO THAT THROUGH THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER THE ROOM THAT WE ACTIVATE WE MOBILIZE AGENCIES AND WITH RICK SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES TASK TO THEM. TO HELP ADDRESS PARTICULAR CASCADING EFFECTS AND CA AND THE CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT OF THESE MAJOR THAT'S AND AS WAS NOTED EARLIER THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STAFF. DID A PHENOMENAL JOB OF STEPPING UP TO A TASK THAT THEY HADN'T PREVIOUSLY -- BEEN HANDED TO COME TOGETHER WORKING CLOSELY WITH US. TO ADDRESS THE INCREDIBLY UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT THE SCHOOLS WERE FACING DURING THESE EVENTS -- THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AND AND LAST YEAR WAS ACTIVATED FOR A HUNDRED AND ONE DAYS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE ARE ACTIVATED FOR A HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN DAYS. WHEN WE ACTIVATE THE DIRECTOR FORMS A UNIFIED COORDINATING GROUP OF SENIOR LEADERS FROM ACROSS NOT ONLY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION -- BUT AS IS HAS BEEN ILLUSTRATED BY OUR PARTNERS A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OUR CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICE -- OFFICE HOLDERS -- THAT PLAY KEY ROLES ACTED THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY IN THE CASE OF THE CAMP HILL HOLES HE FIRES. WE WITHIN HOURS HAD AN INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM FROM THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY MOBILIZED BEFORE WE EVEN HAD A MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION. SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO IS BUILT UPON THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN FORMED BETWEEN OUR SENIOR LEADERS. BOTH THE CALLAWAY YES CAL FIRE THE ADJUTANT GENERAL THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. IN A REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR AT FEMA THOSE INDIVIDUALS COMING TOGETHER -- DEMONSTRATING -- LEADERSHIP AND MOVING THE STATE FORWARD HAS ALLOWED US TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TIME AND AGAIN. TO THE SIGNIFICANT EVENTS. WHAT WE FIND DURING THESE EVENTS IS THE NEED TO FORM CRITICAL TASK FORCES TO REALLY ZERO IN ON PARTICULAR CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT EFFORTS AND DURING THE CAMP HILL AND WE'LL SEE FIRES? WE ACTIVATED SEVEN DIFFERENT TASK FORCES TO DEAL WITH SHELTERING IN HOUSING ISSUES WHICH WHICH WERE USED TO DEALING WITH -- DEALING WITH ISSUES AFFECTING -- ANIMALS THAT ARE DISPLACED BY THESE EVENTS THE WATERSHED IMPACTS THE DEBRIS IMPACTS BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OF THAT FORMED A SCHOOLS TASK FORCES WELL. TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE WERE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AND ADDRESSING THE IMPACTS TO THE SCHOOLS. IN A WERE USED TO ON THE SCHOOL IMPACTS DEALING WITH THE AIR QUALITY CONCERNS AS WE GET THESE MAJOR FIRES IN THE SMOKE STARTS. TO MIGRATE THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- THE IMPACT TO SCHOOLS WE CERTAINLY SITE LAST LAST YEAR IS WIDESPREAD. BUT WHAT WE NEEDED -- TO DOUBLE DOWN ON IN TERMS OF OUR EFFORTS WAS THE IMPACT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT IT WAS GOING TO MEAN. TO RELOCATE REBUILD AND AND MOVE ASIANS AROUND -- IN THIS EVENT WE STOOD UP THE SCHOOLS TASK FORCE WE MOBILIZE STAFF FROM CALLAWAY US ALONG WITH DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STAFF. DOWN INTO THE FIELD TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH OUR PARTNERS BUILT AT THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION'S AS WELL AS WORKING DIRECTLY WITH LOCAL SUPERINTENDENTS. HAS WON SAID WE TOOK EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS TO UTILIZE THE POWERS. THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS TO PUT INTO EXECUTIVE ORDERS -- WAIVERS I'VE THE ADMINISTRATIVE ROAD BLOCKS -- THAT WERE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND MY PARTNER CAROLINE THOMAS JACOBS WILL TALK AND LITTLE GREATER DETAIL ABOUT WHAT OUR TASK FORCE WAS CHARGED WITH. WHAT WE'RE CERTAINLY SEEING AS A RESULT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE CLEAR CLIMB IN A LOGICAL IMPACTS WERE DEALING WITH IN CALIFORNIA? IS AN ABSOLUTE NEW NORMAL UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WE WILL DEAL WITH IN. TWENTY NINETEEN MUCH OF THE SAME IN TERMS OF EVENTS AND IMPACTS THAT WE'VE DEALT WITH IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE ARE MAKING TREMENDOUS STRIDES ACROSS. THE BOTH THE FIRST RESPONDER -- EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT EDUCATION SPECTRUM. TO TO IS TO TO IMPROVE OUR READINESS AND POSTURE -- BUT THERE'S MORE THAT CAN BE DONE AS SUPER FORCED YOUR SCHOOLS PROFESSIONALS ARE ARE THAT THEY ARE EDUCATORS THEY ARE PROFESSIONALS AND THERE'S NOBODY BETTER.

IT ONLY SEEMS NATURAL TO PROVIDE -- COMFORT TO OUR NEIGHBORS THOSE IT SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES HOMELESS AND DEVASTATED WERE FRIENDS OF MINE. FROM HIGH SCHOOL. AND COLLEGE. THEY WERE WORK COLLEAGUES THAT I COME TO KNOW AND CARE. FOR FROM JOBS THAT I'VE HELD OVER THE YEARS. IN SOME OF THEM WERE THE STUDENTS THAT I'VE COACHED IN SPORTS THERE ARE NOW RAISING THEIR OWN CHILDREN. I WASN'T FULLY PREPARED THIS TIME BECAUSE THE STORY WAS HAPPENING TO THE PEOPLE THAT I CONSIDER MY FAMILY. ALL THAT MATTERED IN THAT MOMENT IS THAT WE THEY WERE IN NEED AND WE WERE ABLE TO HELP. I'M GONNA GIVE CREDIT TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE BICU COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THE SUPERINTENDENT AT THE TIME WAS TIM TAYLOR. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FULLY EXPRESS WELL IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FULLY EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE AS I WATCHED HIM IN MARY SUE COLEMAN WHO WAS THE SUPERINTENDENT ELECT AT THE TIME. IS THEY RESPONDED TO THESE TRAGEDIES THERE OUTSIDE AND DETERMINATION TO LIVE UP TO OUR RULE OF STUDENTS FIRST. I'D FIND GREAT LEADERSHIP IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD PEOPLE BY LOVING THEM IN TO SAY PEOPLE BY SERVING THEM. THERE WAS NO BETTER EXAMPLE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. THEN TO WATCH THE ACTIONS OF BOTH TIM MERRY. THEY MADE TOUGH DECISIONS LIKE CLOSING. EXCUSE ME. MY CLOSING ALL SCHOOLS LOCATED IN BICU COUNTY FOR THREE WEEKS. IT WAS NOT ONLY DUE TO THE INCREDIBLY TOXIC AND THEN HEALTHY AIR QUALITY. BUT IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE OF THE MASSIVE UNDERTAKING REQUIRED TO COORDINATE THE EMERGENCY SERVICES AND RELOCATION OF OVER FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS AND STAFF. THEY SOUGHT THE HELP IN THE ADVICE OF COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION IN THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACT IN THE PAST BY WILDFIRES. INCLUDING HAVING SOME OF THEIR STAFF ACTUALLY LEAD OUR EFFORTS. IN RETROSPECT I FIND NOW THAT I'M EVEN STRONGER MY CONVICTION TODAY THAN THE DAY THEY MADE THOSE DECISIONS IN THAT FIRST TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS. IN THAT THEY WERE EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. AGAIN ALL DECISIONS ARE MADE IN LIGHT OF WHAT WAS BETTER IN EDUCATORS. FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS ARE ONLY FOCUS AT THE BUTTE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WAS FINDING A WAY TO RE CONNECT STUDENTS WITH THEIR TEACHERS. THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS THAT OUR STUDENTS WERE DISPLACED WITH ALMOST EVERYONE OF THEM HAVING NO HOME TO RETURN TO AFTER THE EVACUATIONS WERE LIFTED AND NEARLY AN ENTIRE TOWN. HAVING BEEN TAKEN OFF THE MAP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. THAT MEANT THAT EVERY STUDENT TRADITIONAL SCHOOL OR CHARTER SCHOOL PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SCHOOL WAS IN CRISIS. AND WE CHOSE TO SERVE THE MALL. EACH BOARD MEMBER IS WARMER TOOK ON A DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES SUCH AS HELPING COORDINATE TRAUMA SUPPORT. UPDATING OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND WORKING WITH STATE LEGISLATORS TO SECURE LONG TERM FUNDING. ONCE AGAIN MY HEART SWELLED WITH PRIDE AS A DISTRICTS ACROSS THE COUNTY RESPONDED IN LIKE FASHION. I TAKE PRIDE KNOWING THAT THE ORDEAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT DID WHAT THEY COULD TO RELOCATE THEIR STUDENTS ACROSS THE DISTRICT. SO THE PARADISE STUDENTS. COULD REMAIN TOGETHER AND RECONNECT WITH EACH OTHER. AND THEIR TEACHERS AND BEGIN TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES IN SOME SENSE OF NORMALCY AT THEIR NEW HOME. FORMALLY KNOWN AS BIRCH STREET SCHOOL. I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE SCHOOL IT'S LOCATED DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY OWN HOME. AND IT'S ONE OF THE SCHOOLS THAT SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN VISITED ON THAT SECOND FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL. AS I WATCHED HIM JUST SHARE BREAKFAST WITH THE STUDENTS -- FOR ME IT'S A GIFT EVERY DAY THAT I IT WHENEVER I'M HOME THAT I HAVE A REMINDER OF WHY I SERVE. IN WIRE WORK HERE TODAY ACTUALLY MATTERS. AS ONE BOARD MEMBER WAS QUOTED IN OUR ARTICLE FROM THE SANTA BARBARA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT REMINDED US. OUR SCHOOLS ARE THE HEART OF OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER OFTEN THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU -- AND SURROUNDS YOU BROUGHT UP A POINT THAT I HADN'T THOUGHT OF REALLY THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE I KNOW MY OWN CITY I SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL OR JUST UNDER ELEVEN YEARS. AND WE HAD OUR OWN EMERGENCY OP BE ACTIVATED DURING A VARIETY EVENTS BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS PRESENT. AND THAT EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER THAT THAT MEANT SOMETHING. I THINK I NEED TO ASK IT WAS VERY VERY USEFUL -- DURING THE CINEMA COUNTY OFFICE OF THAT -- PARTICIPATION BECAUSE IT PROVIDED DIRECT LINK FROM THE LOCALS TO THE COUNTY -- SEE AND AGAIN IF THERE IS ANY UNMET NEEDS THERE THEN THEY WOULD BE ELEVATED TO US AT THE STATE LEVEL TO SEE WHAT WE COULD DO TO HELP. I GUESS YOU YOU TWO REALLY ARE THE FIRST ONES THAT. THAT DID THAT THAT'S AT THE STATE LEVEL RIGHT WE WEREN'T THERE WASN'T A PLACE FOR EDUCATION PRIOR TO THIS THERE WASN'T MAYBE EVEN IF I NOTED NEED. BUT I THINK THAT WHERE THIS IS NOW THERE AND IT'S HAVE -- IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THE IMPACTS OF BEEN GREATER TO SCHOOLS HAT A CREATED A A GREATER LEVEL OF SUPPORT AT THE STATE LEVEL [inaudible] THANK YOU. SENATE COMES THANK YOU VERY INFORMATIVE THANK YOU ALL. OUR NEXT PANEL IS -- TO A LESSONS LEARNED AND POLICY QUESTIONS. BUT CAN WE TAKE AWAY FROM THIS HEARING REALLY -- TODAY'S FINAL PANEL INCLUDES MANY OF THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION IT SERVED IN A COORDINATING ROLE. IN THE RESPONSE OF RECOVERY FAIR PHASES. OF WILD THE WILDLIFE RESPONSE THEY WILL FOCUS ON LESSONS LEARNED. AND POLICY QUESTIONS FOR THIS BODY THIS LEGISLATURE. GOING FORWARD IN OUR PANELISTS TODAY ARE. IS -- A STEVEN TO ID HARRINGTON SUPERINTEND OF THE CINEMA COUNTY. OFFICE OF EDUCATION STANLEY MANTOOTH SUPERINTENDENT OF VENTURA. COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION JUDY FLOORS SUPERINTENDENT OF SHASTA COUNTY SIKU A SUPERINTENDENT OF BUTTE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WHICH I SPENT SOME TIME WITH. JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO UP NORTH SO WITH THAT I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A MISTER HARRINGTON. MUCH THANK YOU -- CHAIRPERSON O'DONNELL AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU. AS THE NUMBER COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT SCHOOLS IT'S AN HONOR TO SHARE WITH YOU THE LESSONS LEARNED. AND RESPONDING TO CINEMA COUNTIES TUBS FIRE. AS WELL AS MY EXPERIENCE HOLDING OTHER EDUCATIONAL LEADERS. AND HELPING OTHER OTHER EDUCATIONAL IS WITH A SIMILAR CATASTROPHIC DISASTERS. I COMMEND YOU FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING SO THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATORS AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE AGENCIES CAN BE BETTER PREPARED TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND THE CHILDREN IN THE NEXT DISASTER STRIKES WHEN THE NEXT DISASTER STRIKES. IN CINEMA COUNTY NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO MY OFFICE IS PRIVILEGE TO SERVE. FORTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. PROVIDE CARE AND EDUCATION FOR MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. SOME DISTRICTS ARE SMALL IN RURAL SERVING AS FEW AS TEN STUDENTS WHILE OTHERS ARE LARGE AND URBAN. WE ARE HOME TO A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE SCHOOLS FIFTY SIX OF WHICH ARE CHARTER SCHOOLS. MOST OF THOSE ARE DEPENDENT CHARTER SCHOOLS MEANING THEY FUNCTION AS PART OF THE DISTRICT. ONE COUNTRY IS ASSOCIATED WITH WEALTH. BUT ABOUT 45% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OUR COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE THE TUBS FIRE. AT AT THAT TIME IT WAS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. IN MORE THAN FORTY YEARS FORTY SIX YEARS I HAVE WORKED IN EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I HAVE RESPONDED TO NUMEROUS FLOODS AND EARTHQUAKES IN MY THIRTY SIX YEARS AS SUPERINTENDENT. BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN A NATURAL DISASTER TAKE SUCH A TOLL ON EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY AS TO THE TYPES FOR WILDFIRE. THE WILDFIRES SWEPT THROUGH INTO THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA OVERNIGHT. LEAPING OVER SIX LANE FREEWAY. AND OVERWHELMING OUR EMERGENCY SERVICES. IT DESTROYED NUMEROUS SCHOOL SITES AND THE HOMES OF NEARLY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EDUCATORS AND OUR MOST IMPACTED SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE'RE CLOSE WE'RE JUST DISTRICTS WERE CLOSED FOR THREE WEEKS AS THEY DEALT WITH THE AFTERMATH. TWO SCHOOLS COULD NOT REOPEN FOR FOUR MONTHS. BECAUSE OF TOXIC DEBRIS IN ASH HAD TO BE CLEARED FROM THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD THE ONLY THING STANDING WAS THE SCHOOL. SINCE IT THEN AS YOU KNOW SIMILAR WILDFIRES HAVE BURNED INTO OTHER COMMUNITIES CAUSING ANY MORE DEVASTATION. I'VE COME IN THE EDUCATIONAL LEADERS FOR CINEMA BEAUTE SHASTA VENTURA AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES. AND THE OTHER IMPACTED AS THEY RESPONDED QUICKLY WITH THE INNOVATION. OF THESE UNPRECEDENTED DISASTERS. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO ARE PARTNERS IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. BECAUSE THEY HEARD OUR PLEA AND WE AT REACTED QUICKLY SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SCHOOLS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN RESTORING NORMALCY TO CHILDREN'S LIVES IN ADDRESSING TRAUMA YOU FOR THAT TODAY. TODAY I'D LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU FOR CONSIDERATION SOME UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT IN URBAN WILDFIRE CAN CAUSE AND POSE FOR SCHOOLS AND SOME POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER. ONE PROTECT SCHOOL FUNDING. AFTER CRISIS CONSISTENT FUNDING IS MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER TO HELP SCHOOLS REBUILD. THANKS TO THE ACTION ON THE PART OF THE LEGISLATION CREATED TO HOLD HARMLESS AND AB UNDER THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. SONOMA COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT WERE PROTECTED LOSING FUNDING IF STOCK WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES WAS LOST. HOWEVER IN LOOKING CLOSER AT THE LANGUAGE INCLUDED IN AB EIGHTEEN FORTY WE FOUND THIS DID NOT APPLY TO CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT WERE IMPACTED. ONLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. PERSONAL THE COUNTY THIS LIST SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT AREAS INCLUDING COFFEE PARK AND MARK WEST WITH FUNDING DECREASES TO AREAS SERVED BY THEIR DEPENDENT CHARTER SCHOOLS. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DEVELOP A STANDARD STATUTORY LANGUAGE WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE TO HOLD HARMLESS ALL LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES INCLUDING SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COUNTY OFFICES. IN FUTURE NATURAL DISASTERS. THIS IS NEEDED UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF SUCH DISASTERS ARE BECOMING NORMAL. RE OPENING SCHOOLS. I ALSO URGE YOU TO DEVELOP A STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL FOR RE OPENING A SCHOOL SITE AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY TOXIC FIRES. THEIR PROTOCOL THREE OPENINGS SCHOOL SITES AFTER EARTHQUAKE HAD BEEN LIVED THROUGH THAT. BUT PRIOR TO OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN TUBS FIRE NONE WERE IN PLACE FOR RE OPENING SCHOOLS. THE SITES THAT WERE IMPACT I THINK YOU HEARD FROM THE STATE TODAY THEY CREATED SPECIAL TASK FORCE TO WIN OUT TO OUR DISTRICTS. AND EVALUATED BECAUSE DISTRICTS STAND LOCAL JURISDICTION THE ONLY THE LOCAL SUPERINTENDENT CAN DETERMINE WHETHER RE OCCUPANCY IS NOT AS LOUD. THE TUBS FIRE A SPECIAL TASK FORCE WAS CONVENE BY THE CD AND CAL -- YES AND WAS HELPFUL IN ASSISTING THESE LOCAL DISTRICTS FIND A SOLUTION AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP THIS TYPE OF STATE TASK FORCE IN PLACE AND READY TO MOBILIZE IN FUTURE DISASTERS. AS WELL GUIDANCE IS NEEDED FOR DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. REGARDING TOXIC ASH AND HOW IT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH. AIR QUALITY GUIDELINES. LIKE Y. STANDARD GUIDANCE IS NEEDED TO HELP SCHOOLS DETERMINE WHEN TO CLOSE AND HOW TO ENSURE STUDENT SAFETY WHEN AIR. QUALITY IS HAZARD. AFTER THE CAMP COVERED A LARGE REGION FOR MORE THAN A WEEK IN CINEMA COUNTY. THIS PUTS SCHOOLS IN THE CHALLENGING POSITION OF TRYING TO ACT AS PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS IN DETERMINING WHEN IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO KEEP SCHOOLS OPEN. IN SPEAKING WITH AIR QUALITY EXPERTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. MY OFFICE LEARNED THAT SCIENCE AROUND AIR QUALITY FOR URBAN WILDFIRES IS STILL EVOLVING. THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT OVER THE BEST AIR QUALITY MONITORING SITE TO USE WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO KEEP SCHOOLS OPEN OR CLOSE NOT ALL AIR QUALITY DISTRICTS ARE EQUAL. AND WHETHER TO HAND OUT MASKS OR NOT. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONVENE EXPERTS IN PEDIATRIC HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH AND THEIR QUALITY DETERMINE A STANDARDIZED SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE FOLLOWING. WHAT AIR QUALITY MONITORING SITE SHOULD BE USED WHEN IF EVER SCHOOL SHOULD CLOSE DUE TO POOR AIR QUALITY? MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS CHOOSE TO STAY OPEN BECAUSE THEY SAW IT AS AN EQUITY ISSUE. TO PROVIDE CLEAN AIR AND ENVIRONMENT AND IT JUST TO DO IT TOO IT'S DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. HOW TO EQUIP SCHOOLS WITH FILTRATION SYSTEMS THAT ARE GOOD FOR AIR QUALITY THEY WOULD LIVE? ENSURE GOOD AIR QUALITY. WHEN CAN SCHOOLS EXPECT TO BE REIMBURSED FOR CLOSING DUE TO AIR QUALITY CONCERNS? SHOULD AND IN NINETY FIVE MASS BE DISTRIBUTED TO CHILDREN AND OR EDUCATORS. WE HAVE RECEIVED CONFLICTING INFORMATION FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES ON THESE QUESTIONS. THE COUNTY OFFICES LEAD AGENCY COUNTY OFFICE TO SHOULD BECOME THE LEAD AGENCY FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS DURING AND AS DISASTER. SCOPES NUMBER COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION ACTED IN THIS ROLE TO THE CATHOLIC DISS TO THE SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST. CHARTER AND SCHOOLS THAT WERE IN BOTH OF THOSE TO RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS LOST THEIR SCHOOL SITES. TOTALLY TO THE GROUND. ONE OF THE SOME OF SCHOOLS IMPACTED THE CATHOLIC THAT'S WERE ST ROSE -- CARDINAL NEWMAN. AND THE ARE SLIM CAMPUS WERE GONE. WE DID PAPERWORK FOR BOTH PROPER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. WELL FILE RECOVERY TOOL KIT UNFORTUNATELY THE LIKELIHOOD OF A SIMILAR DISASTER IMPACTING OTHER EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITIES IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD IS VERY HIGH. OUR OFFICE ALL FOUR OF OUR OFFICES ARE WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS ASSOCIATION. TO DEVELOP A TOOL KIT FOR COUNTY OFFICES THEY CAN BE USED IN FUTURE WILDFIRE FIRES. ANCHORAGE LEGISLATURE TO WORK WITH THE CSS CSS ARE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A STATE TOOL KIT [inaudible] MENTAL HEALTH. THE MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF A TRAUMA SUCH AS A FIRE ARE FAR REACHING AND LONG LASTING. CINEMA COUNTY SCHOOLS ARE STILL DEALING WITH STUDENT AND STAFF WHO HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED. WE WERE FORTUNATE TO BENEFIT FROM GRANTS THAT ALLOWED US TO CONTRACT WITH EXPERTS IN PROVIDE TRAINING AND RESOURCES TO OUR SCHOOLS AND FAMILY. NOT EVERY IMPACTED COMMUNITY. HAS BEEN THIS LUCKY. I WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL OF CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DIVISION WHICH PROVIDE A LINE OF SUPPORT TO SCHOOLS TO ASSIST THEM IN DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES. ADDRESSING STUDENT AND TEACHER TRAUMA WILL IN IT WILL ENABLE OUR COMMUNITIES TO HEAL AND OUR STUDENTS TO THRIVE AND DEVELOP RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU WAS VERY CAN [inaudible] MEREDITH. CHARO DONNELL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO PROVIDE LITTLE INPUT ABOUT OUR LOCAL LANDSCAPING EXPERIENCE. ENTER COUNTIES HOME TO TWENTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- WOULD SERVE NEARLY HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND THEY ALL VERY WIDELY IN SIZE AND STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS. ONE OF THESE JUST TORY BOTH IN LOS ANGELES AND INVENTOR COUNTIES AND IS LOCATED PRIMARILY IN THE CITIES OF CALABASAS AGORA HILLS WESTLAKE VILLAGE AND UNINCORPORATED AREAS. ARE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IS KAMALA VALLEY UNIFIED IN THE THOUSAND OAKS NEWBURY PARK AREA AT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. THE SMALLEST SANTA CLARA ELEMENTARY WITH FIFTY SEVEN STUDENTS IN A LITTLE RED SCHOOLHOUSE ON HIGHWAY. ONE TWENTY SIX DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS. WE'VE EXPERIENCED NOT ONE BUT TWO WILDFIRE EVENTS. THE THOMAS FIRE WHICH BEGAN ON DECEMBER FOURTH IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THE WALLS IN HILL FIRES WHICH STARTED ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GATHER THESE TWO DISASTERS ACCOUNTED FOR THE DESTRUCTION OR DAMAGE OF ALMOST THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOMES THANKFULLY. NONE OF THE SCHOOL SITES WERE BURNED. BUT I WOULD REMISS BE REMISS IN NOT ALSO. REMINDING EVERYONE OF THE THIRD OF THAT DISASTER WHICH BEFELL US IN THOUSAND OAKS WITH THE BORDERLINE SHOOTINGS -- THAT HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE WILL SEE AN HILL FIRES. YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE TAG ON THAT. DURING THE THOMAS FIRE ALL VENTURA COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE CLOSE AT LEAST ONE DAY WHEREVER THEY WERE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. BUT VENTER UNIFIED -- THE MOST SEVERELY AFFECTED WAS CLOSE FOR FOURTEEN SCHOOL THE X.. THAT BACK RIGHT UP AGAINST OUR WINTER HOLIDAY SO SKILLS WERE OUT OF SCHOOL. FOR A PERIOD OF NEARLY FIVE WEEKS. AND IN MANY OTHER DISTRICTS THERE WERE CLOSURES OF THIRTEEN TWELVE TEN EIGHT SCHOOL DAYS. DEPENDING UPON CONDITION LOCAL CONDITIONS AND SOME DISTRICTS CLOSED RE OPENED AND THEN CLOSED AGAIN. BASED UPON CHANGING AIR QUALITY. MORE THAN A YEAR LATER. IN THE VENTURE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. FIVE SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED BECAUSE OF THE THREAT IN THE RECENT RAINS OF DEBRIS FLOW BECAUSE BY THE THOMAS FIRE OR SLOPE MOVEMENT. BECAUSE THE LAND IS SO SATURATED. OVER THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS. LOST THEIR HOMES IN THIS FIRE AND THE REMEDIATION OF THE FACILITIES EVEN THOUGH THEY WEREN'T BURNED. REQUIRED FROM THE IMPACT OF THE SMOKE. WROTE MADE US DO EXTENSIVE CLEANING REPLACEMENT OF ALL OF OUR HVAC SYSTEMS. IN THE MORE RECENT WILL THE INHALER FIRES THE CANAL UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS CLOSED FOR A PERIOD OF SEVEN FULL DAYS. AND FIVE OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE SURROUNDING AREA CLOSED. FOR FIVE SIMILAR CHALLENGES WITH REGARD TO AIR QUALITY STUDENT HEALTH AND THE REORGANIZATION OF ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION ROUTES ALSO OCCURRED. THOSE ALSO CAME WITH PRICE TAGS. IN BOTH OF THESE EVENTS ARE OFFICE WAS ABLE TO SERVE AS A PUBLIC CLEARING HOUSE FOR INFORMATION ABOUT SCHOOL CLOSURES FOR ALL OF THE ELLIE ETS. AND THIS INFORMATION PROVED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY VALUABLE AND RELIABLE. THAT THIS VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- DIRECTED THE PUBLIC TO OUR WEBSITE WE ALSO DID HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE IN THE LOCAL EOC. THE ALSO COORDINATED THE DAILY PHONE CALLS WITH DISTRICTS SUPERINTENDENTS TO DISCUSS THE AIR QUALITY IN SCHOOL CLOSURES. AND OUR SPECIAL POPULATIONS DEPARTMENT ALSO PROVIDED SUPPORT TO THE MARGARET COMMUNITIES WHICH WERE IMPACTED BY THE THOMAS FIRE. A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SOMETIMES GET FORGET FORGOTTEN ABOUT. IN IN EVERY INSTANCE WHEN WE THOUGHT ABOUT. KIDS COME TO SCHOOL KIDS SAFETY. SAFETY ALWAYS TRUMPED LEARNING IN THIS CASE. AND FROM THE OUTSET STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES CAL FIRE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WERE VERY QUICK TO OFFER THEIR SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE. AND THESE ARE PLEDGES WHICH CONTINUE TO EXIST TO THIS DAY. A GREAT MANY THINGS WENT RIGHT DURING THESE DISASTERS AS A RESULT OF THE COLLABORATIVE CULTURE. THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COUNTY NONETHELESS PERRANCE. TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT MISS LEARNING. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO OPEN THE SCHOOLS. THE AMAZING THING IS THAT BOTH THE STUDENTS AND THE STAFF COULD NOT WAIT. TO GET BACK TO NORMAL. SO WITH REGARD TO POLICY CHANGES OR INITIATIVES GOING FORWARD. COULD OFFER THE FOLLOWING -- PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON QUESTION THAT I WAS ASKED IS. ARE WE GONNA MAKE UP THE DAYS. AND I SAID I'M SORRY. WE'RE GOING TO ME WITH MADE WHOLE BY THE DAYS THAT WE LOST THROUGH A WAIVER PROCESS. BUT THERE IS NO MECHANISM NOR IS THERE AND IDENTIFIED FUNDING SOURCE TO BE ABLE TO RESTORE THE LEARNING. FOR KIDS THAT MIGHT HAVE ONLY GOTTEN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX OUT OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS BECAUSE OF AN UNFORESEEN DISASTER. SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT I KNOW IT'S A HEAVY LIFT. THAT COMES THAT'S THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. ALSO ENSURING THAT THERE ARE MEET EMERGENCY WAIVERS THAT AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER THAT DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE ASKED FOR OR WAITED FOR TO OCCUPY NON DIVISION OF THE STATE ARCHITECT APPROVED FACILITIES. IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE QUICKEST RETURN TO OUR KIDS LEARNING. AND ALSO SOME PROVISION WITHIN THE STATE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM FOR SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DIDN'T EXPECT TO HAVE TO REBUILD THE SCHOOL OR RECONSTRUCTED SCHOOL. AND WE'RE NOT IN LINE FOR FUNDING THROUGH THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD. I BELIEVE THERE MAY BE SOME EMERGENCY FUNDING THERE BUT TO PUT IT AT A HIGHER PRIORITY. ON THOSE THAT WERE AFFECTED BY SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER THAN THEMSELVES WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL. AND ALSO -- AS DR HARRINGTON REFERRED -- TO IS ALSO SERVE STUDENT POPULATIONS IN MANY CASES WE SERVE THE MOST AT RISK AND NEEDY POPULATIONS MANY SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATIONS. BUT WHEN WE LOSE STUDENTS THAT DON'T COME BACK AFTER A DISASTER. WE DON'T GET A GRACE PERIOD LIKE REGULAR SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO TO EASE THE BURDEN OF LOST ENROLLMENT. WE THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO WE COULD BE ADDED TO THAT POT -- AND AGAIN -- THERE'S MUCH MORE TO BE SAID BY MY COLLEAGUES AND MUCH THAT YOU HAVE HEARD TODAY. OF EXTREME VALUE AND I THANK YOU -- AND FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THESE REFLECTIONS THANK YOU. MISS FLORES. MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU. SHASTA COUNTY IS HOME TO TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS IN A COMBINATION OF TWENTY FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SEVENTY FIVE SCHOOLS. 70% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE WHITE WITH OUR LARGEST ETHNIC GROUPS BEING HISPANIC AND AMERICAN INDIAN. LAST YEAR WE HAD 57% OF OUR STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH. A CAR FIRE WHICH BEGAN ON JULY TWENTY FOURTH AND DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS WAS SUMMER -- TOOK THIRTY EIGHT DAYS FOR A SCHOOLS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN LOST WERE SAVED BECAUSE THEY BECAME THE HOME BASE FOR THOSE FIGHTING THE FIRE. BECAUSE SHASTA COUNTY IS AN OPEN ENROLLMENT COUNTY. THE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN KINDERGARTEN THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE OUR KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE STUDENTS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES ACTUALLY HAD ATTENDED FORTY FIVE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. WHISKEYTOWN ENVIRONMENTAL SCHOOL HAS PERMANENTLY CLOSED AFTER FORTY NINE YEARS OF PROVIDING A WEEK LONG ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION EXPERIENCE TO FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE STUDENTS IN THE NORTH STATE DUE TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEBRIS FLOW. FROM HEAVILY BURNED AREAS THAT SURROUND IT. DAMAGE AT THE SHASTA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BECAUSE THE SCHOOL TO RELOCATE FOR SIX MONTHS AND THEY PLAN TO RETURN ON FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A FEW BEST PRACTICES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF OUR EXPERIENCE. THE DAY AFTER THE FIRE CAME INTO READING IN OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD SERVICES DIRECTORS DEVELOPED -- PLAN CONTRA CONTACTING THE TO CHILD CARE. AND CENTER BASS LICENSE FACILITIES ARE DIRECTORS PULLED THE LICENSE FACILITIES LIST MAPPED THE EVACUATION AREAS AND STRATEGICALLY CALLED PROVIDERS IN THE DANGER AREA FIRST OFFERING SUPPORT AND SERVICE COORDINATION. STAFF COLLECTED INFORMATION IF PROVIDERS WERE EVACUATED LOST THEIR HOME OR BUSINESS IF THEY WERE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. HOW MANY CHILDREN THEY COULD SERVE AND THEIR CURRENT ENROLLMENT? WE USE THIS INFORMATION TO LINK FAMILIES WHO ARE IN NEED OF EMERGENCY CHILD CARE SERVICES AND KEPT COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING AND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF ED INFORMED. IN ADDITION WE CONTACTED FAMILIES IN SUPPORT OF FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY CHILDREN SERVE THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIZE CARE PROGRAMS WHO LIVED IN THE CAR FIRE AFFECTED AREAS. OFFERING SUPPORT IN LOCATING ALTERNATIVE CHILD CARE COMPLETING CAL FRESH APPLICATIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY KNEW TO GO TO THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE CENTER WHEN IT WAS OPENED. EVEN THOUGH THE FIRE BEGAN IN THE SUMMER WE BROUGHT TOGETHER DISTRICT IN CHARTER SCHOOL LEADERS TO SHARE WITH THEM INFORMATION AND RESOURCES. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF ED PARTICIPATED IN OUR INITIAL MEETING VIA PHONE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS RIGHT AS THEY AROSE. AFTER THAT DAY AND FOR THE NEXT MONTH WE SENT OUT A DAILY BULLETIN TO EDUCATIONAL LEADERS COMBINING ALL OF THE INFORMATION IN ONE PLACE THAT WE HAD LEARNED THAT DAY. SOME INFORMATION CAME THROUGH THE COUNTY EMERGENCY SERVICES COLLABORATORS MEETING THAT I ATTENDED. OTHER INFORMATION CAME THROUGH EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS. OUR OFFICE COMBINED ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IN TO ONE GOOGLE DOC IT TO SEND AT THE END OF EACH DAY AND THE COMMUNICATION MATH AND WAS WELL RECEIVED BY ALL OF OUR LEAGUE ARE EDUCATION LEADERS. WHEN THE LOCAL LISTING CENTER OPENED OUR OFFICE MADE IT A PRIORITY TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE STUDENTS? CHILDREN FROM ZERO TO AGE EIGHTEEN WHO LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE FIRE TALKING WITH EACH FAMILY THAT CAME THROUGH. THE LOCAL IS SINCE LOCAL ASSISTANCE CENTER. WE CREATED THAT MASTER LIST OF OF INCLUDING THOSE WHO WERE IN CHILD CARE. IT CHILD CARE CENTERS THOSE IN PRESCHOOL THOSE ACROSS K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. AS WELL AS HELP TO REGISTER FAMILIES FOR CHILDCARE PRESCHOOL AND EMERGENCY CAL FOR ASH VOUCHERS. THIS TOOK THE BURDEN OFF OF ALL THE SCHOOLS THAT WERE IMPACTED AND CREATED A MASTER LIST OF STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT WAS HELPFUL IN KEEPING. IN SCHOOLS INFORMED IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD. I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT TO CHALLENGES OUR SCHOOLS FACED IN WHERE WE COULD USE YOUR ASSISTANCE. THE FIRST CHALLENGE IS IN REGARD TO THE FIELD ACT REQUIREMENT WHICH MANDATES EARTH GROUP EARTHQUAKE RESISTANT CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOLS. BUT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE LOCATED WITHIN BUILDINGS THEY HAVE THE SAME REQUIREMENTS. BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGES SHASTA ELEMENTARY THEY HAD TO RELOCATE. AND AS THEY LOOKED AT BUILDING AFTER BUILDING NONE OF THEM MET THIS CRITERIA. AS A RESULT -- I REACHED OUT TO LIVE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF ED IN QUESTION WHY AN EMERGENCY OTHER SCHOOLS COULDN'T BE GIVEN THAT SAME FLEXIBILITY THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE TO BE IN A NON FIELD ACT BUILDING. AFTER THE DECISION WAS REACHED TO MOVE THE ELEVEN CLASSROOMS FROM SHASTA ELEMENTARY INTO SEVEN OPEN SPACES AT ANOTHER SCHOOL ABOUT TEN MILES AWAY. THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER CAME OUT THAT ALLOWED FOR USE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE OF A NON FEEL THAT BUILDING BUT AT THAT POINT WAS TOO LATE THEY HAD ALREADY NOTIFIED PERRANCE. THE SECOND CHALLENGE IS TRANSPORTATION AND YOU'VE HEARD THAT ALREADY THIS AFTERNOON. SHASTA COUNTY IS A LARGE GEOGRAPHIC AREA COVERING OVER THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE MILES. VERY FEW FAMILIES LEFT THE COUNTY AFTER THE FIRE BUT STUDENTS WERE SPREAD THROUGHOUT FOR EXAMPLE ONE DISTRICT THAT WAS HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE FIRE HAD ONE FAMILY RELOCATE WITH RELATIVES FORTY MINUTES AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL. STILL IN SHASTA COUNTY. AND WITHIN THE MCKINNEY VENTO ACT HOMELESS STUDENTS HAVE THAT ABILITY TO REMAIN IN THE SCHOOL OF ORIGIN DURING THE TIME OF THEIR HOMELESSNESS OR AND FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR. THE SCHOOL I WAS REFERENCE SEEN IS A SCHOOL OF FORTY STUDENTS ACROSS KATE EIGHT AND SO THE THE COST FOR THAT TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION IS DRAMATIC. SO TYPICALLY WITHIN THE SCHOOL YEAR EIGHT THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS STUDENTS IS SMALL BUT WITHIN THE CAR FIRE SOME SCHOOLS SAW THE NUMBER DRAMATICALLY RISE WITH NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO SUPPORT THIS NEED. AND SCHOOLS TYPICALLY PAY FOR THE COST OF HOMELESS TRANSPORTATION OUT OF TITLE ONE DOLLARS THAT THEY RECIEVED. BUT THIS EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE COSTS FOR TRANS TAKE IT AWAY FROM READING AND MATH INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR THIS FUNDING. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SO THAT OTHERS CAN LEARN FROM OUR EXPERIENCE AND POTENTIAL CHANGES CAN BE MADE TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS IMPACTED BY WILDFIRE IN THE FUTURE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YOU'VE HEARD HOW ENTIRE COMMUNITIES SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN BUTTE COUNTY WERE DECIMATED BY THE CAMPFIRE ON A MEMBER EIGHTH. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE IMPACTED BY SCHOOL CLOSURES. AND FORTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS WERE LEFT HOMELESS. MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED SCHOOL STAFF MEMBERS FROM AROUND BUTTE COUNTY HAVE ALSO LOST THEIR HOMES. OUR ROLE AS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION IS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO ALL SCHOOLS AND ALL STUDENTS IN OUR RESPECTIVE COUNTIES. WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS OUR JOB TO ADVOCATE FOR SCHOOLS. COMMUNICATING UNMET NEEDS UP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND THROUGH AN INCIDENT COMMAND STRUCTURE. INCLUDING OUR OWN THE INCIDENT COMMAND HAVE. AN IN COORDINATION WITH THE JOINT SCHOOLS TASK FORCE. OUR COMMON MESSAGE IN BICU COUNTY WAS LET'S REUNITE OUR STUDENTS WITH THEIR TEACHERS. IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE DEPLOYED A NUMBER OF RETIRED AND ACTIVE ADMINISTRATORS AND CONSULTANTS TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS. TO SUPPORT THEIR VARYING NEEDS INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS NUTRITION.I. T. FACILITIES PLANNING FISCAL RECOVERY AND DONATIONS MANAGEMENT. SPECIAL CONSIDERATION ALSO NEEDED TO BE GIVEN TO OUR EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS ARE PRESCHOOLS CHILD CARE NEEDS AND OUR EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS. AND TRULY IN BUTTE COUNTY. IT WAS VICTIMS HELPING VICTIMS. WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE STATE RESOURCES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACCESS INCLUDING THE GREAT SUPPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. CAL O. E. S..

AND WE ARE ALSO SO VERY GRATEFUL TO OUR PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS ACCENT CSPA CASTRO AND THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. AS FOR AREAS OF POLICY WE ARE ASKING AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY ASKED. FOR ON GOING MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING AND SUPPORTS. IN BUTTE COUNTY WE ALREADY HAD THE HIGHEST ACES RATE PRIOR TO THE FIRE. AND NOW ARE MOST IMPOVERISHED RURAL STUDENTS HAVE BEEN RE TRAUMATIZE HAVING SUFFERED THROUGHTHIS MAJOR LIFE CHANGING EVENT. BC -- WE IMMEDIATELY DEPLOYED TEAMS OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS POSSESS BUT AS OUR COLLEAGUE MICHELLE JOHN NOTED EARLIER IT SIMPLY IS NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE COORDINATED RESPONSE AND TRAINING THAT'S ON GOING WE HAVE BROUGHT IN WORLD RENOWNED EXPERTS TO SUPPORT US AND TO HELP TRAIN THE TRAINERS. BUT THIS IS A MARATHON IT IS NOT A SPRINT. NBC -- HE IS DEDICATED TO HELPING TO LEAD THE WAY WITH YOUR HELP. WE CONSIDER OURSELVES TO BE AMONG THE RURAL EXPERTS AND WE'RE INTERESTED IN HELPING OTHER RURAL AREAS AS WELL. IT IS ARE RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN T. K. THROUGH. TWELVE AND TO ALSO OFFER SPECIAL CONSIDERATION AND SUPPORTS FOR CHILDREN AGES. ZERO TO FIVE WE ARE ASKING FOR FUNDING STABILIZATION FOR OUR MOST IMPACTED SCHOOLS. FIRST FOUR EIGHTY EIGHT PROTECTIONS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR THROUGH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AT MINIMUM. FOR ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE ARE ALSO ASKING THAT FOR YOUR SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR TINY GOLDEN FEATHER UNION ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH IRONICALLY IS A BASIC AID SCHOOL DISTRICT. THAT RELIES ON DIRECTLY RELIES ON PROPERTY AND YET IS AMONG OUR MOST IMPOVERISHED COUNTY EXCUSE ME COUNTY SCHOOL. ADDITIONALLY WE'RE ASKING FOR EIGHTY EIGHT PROTECTION FOR THE CELL BY A SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREA FUNDING THROUGH A BEAT. SIX OH TWO AND OF COURSE CLASS SIZE FLEXIBILITY. AND AS WELL AS CONSIDERATION FOR THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FEMALE HOUSING IN OTHER DISTRICT LOCATIONS. AND PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT BICU COUNTY HAS YET TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS ANY OF THE FEDERAL DOLLARS SUCH AS THOSE PROVIDED OTHER COUNTIES THROUGH PROJECT SURF. IN REGARD TO FACILITIES NEEDS WE ASK FOR TEMPORARY FACILITIES WAIVERS THROUGH. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY DURING THIS TIME OF CHANGING REALITIES. AS WELL AS ASSISTANCE AND ADVICE WITH CLEANUP DEMOLITION AND TREE REMOVAL FOR THOSE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. OR CALLOW WE AS DEBRIS REMOVAL PROGRAMS OR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FROM FEMA. AND FINALL WE URGE YOU TO CONSIDER BUTTE COUNTY AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS. FOR HELP AND ESTABLISHMENT OF LOCAL PRE APPRENTICESHIP APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM TRAINING NEEDS. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR AREA HAS LOST AN ESTIMATED SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS TO THE LOCAL GDP. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT OUR BUTTE COUNTY RESIDENTS HAVE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY FOR RETRAINING AND JOB PLACEMENT IN THE REBUILDING EFFORTS. BUTTE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IS COMMITTED TWO LEADING THE WAY AND BEING ACTIVE PARTNERS WITH OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND ACTIVELY TRAINING AND FINING PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR LOCAL FOLKS AND THAT WORK HAS ALREADY BEGUN. THE DAUNTING TASK OF REBUILDING OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES LIES AHEAD OF US. YES WE ARE BUTTE SCHOOL STRONG. BUT PLEASE CONSIDER HELPING US IN PROVIDING OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COUNTY OFFICES WITH THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO RECOVER REBUILD. AND REIMAGINE THE FUTURE FOR OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THINK YOU THIS PAN LINED UP. ANOTHER SOME QUESTIONS I JUST ALSO MAKE SOME COMMENTS QUICKLY -- I HAVE A LIST OF THINGS I HEARD HIM THAT I'M NOT GOING TO READ IT ALL OFF. BUT THE PROTECTING SCHOOL FUNDING THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THEY'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED. AND WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE TWO YEARS OUT THREE YEARS OUT AND THEN EVEN LONGER YES. THE TIME FOR THESE GUYS IN A LONG TIME FOR SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES TO REBUILD THE A FUNNY INTERACT WITH THAT ON AN ONGOING BASIS BECAUSE THE STUDENT NUMBERS WILL DROP BUT THEN THEY MIGHT SPIKE AT SOME POINT. TOO SO THAT IS TO BE A CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO HAVE -- THE RE OPENING A REAL OPENING STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL AQM DIS ACROSS THE STATE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S A MILITARY THAT -- WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT WITH THAT APPROACH BECAUSE LA IS SO BIG. RIGHT AND AIR QUALITY OVER HERE IS THE SAME AS THE AIR QUALITY IS OVER THERE SO HOW DO THEY MAKE THAT CALL WHAT KIND OF MONITORING TO THE EMPLOYEE. IF WE ARE TO HAND IT OVER TO THE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S SO THAT'LL BE A CONVERSATION. WE HAVE MAKING THE COUNTY'S LEAD. BECAUSE THEY DON'T ALL AIR MONITOR ASH IN ASH DEBRIS. CAM. SO FOR THE COULD GET ALL AIR QUALITY CONTROL BOARDS. UTILIZING THE SAME AIR QUALITY MONITORING SYSTEM MY COUNTY IS DIVIDED IN HALF. SO IT'S LIKE HOW DO YOU GET A GOOD READING AND IF YOU GO TO A COMMERCIAL LIKE PURPLE AIR. THAT'S LOCAL PEOPLE PUT THAT IN THEIR HOME JOURNAL WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED. BUT WE CAN'T EVEN GET A CONSISTENT BETWEEN THE TWO OKAY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO HAVE AND I LIVE IN AN AREA WITH A LOT OF OUR MIND AIR QUALITY. MANAGEMENT GOING ON BECAUSE I HAVE TO PORTS SMATTERING OF FIVE MILES AWAY THERE'S A WIND BLOWN OF THE OCEAN VERY CLEAN AND THEN IT'S NOT A PARTICULAR MATTER IN THE AIR. OTHER TOOL KIT -- FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS I WOULD HOPE THAT THE THE SUIT STATE SUPERINTENDENT COULD ACTUALLY TAKE UP THAT TASK. AND AND WORK WITH YOU. TO DO THAT TO BE INCLUDED. OKAY. OKAY SO YOU DID NOT DID YOU STILL NEED. TO DO SO SO. WHERE DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU AT ALL NO? OKAY. EXECUTIVE ORDER PLAY BUT IT DIDN'T APPLY FOR FOR HOUSING FLEXIBILITY OKAY SO THE FEEL THE FEEL THAT REQUIREMENTS WERE NOT WAY BEARD IS YOU KNOW THEY WILL YOU STILL NEED THAT WAIVER -- WE'RE WE'RE MANAGING TO GET BY WITH PRE EXISTING BUILDINGS. BUT THEY DO HAVE THE YOU DID GET THE WAIVER AND UNDER THAT WAIVER WAS HE WAS DOWN THERE A WEEK -- THEY HAD BEEN LOOKING. FOR WE GET HOUSING IT WAS AFTER A WEEK THAT THE SCHOOL HAD BEEN IMPACTED BEFORE THE EXECUTIVE ORDER CAME THROUGH FAMILIES WERE ASKING YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING SO THEY HAD. GONE AROUND AND LOOKED AND IT WAS -- IF I RECALL A WEEK I I DID BRING THE DATE WITH ME BUT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE THE EXECUTIVE ORDER CAME THROUGH. IN THE BILL THAT WAS INCLUDED FOR YOU YES AND UNDERSTAND -- IN THE MAKE UP DAYS THAT'S AN ISSUE I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THEN WITH REGARD TO SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM I SIT ON THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD. AND I KNOW WE JUST DID SOMETHING FOR PARADISE RECENTLY I'M SURE IT'S NOT ENOUGH I'M QUITE CONFIDENT OF THAT -- SO THAT'LL BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION LOST EIGHTY A AGAIN. AND OTHER DONATION MANAGEMENT I HEARD THAT A LOT OF THE IN YOU KNOW. SIX SEVEN HAVE YOU A BAG FULL OF GIVE CARDS YEAH YEAH. AND I GET WHY THAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE AND HOW DOES THAT I'LL GET THAT I DON'T KNOW THOSE ARE ONLY LOCAL PROTOCOL SO THERE'S SOME STATE ACCOUNTING. MECHANISM YOU'RE SUPPOSED EMPLOYED BUT THAT'S INTERESTING -- TO SO WITH THAT THANK UNITED NOTE JUST REAL QUICK CHáVEZ JOHNSON YOU ONE OF THESE ARE THE COUNTIES WE HEARD FROM. THE LOCALS WANT TO SAY ANYTHING DID YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING OR DO THEY COVERED ADEQUATELY. OR DO YOU WANT TO DIFFER FROM THEM YOU CAN DO IT NOW. NOW IS YOUR TIME [inaudible] THE COVERED. IT JUST JUST TO JUST THREE THE THEM FEDERALLY HAS NOT COME IN YET. NOW FOR THE YOU. KNOW HOW MANY RESERVE FEDERAL AID IS I'M SORRY WE HAVE RECEIVED OUR FEDERAL YEAH. WELL MISTER GALLAGHER THE TRUMP YOUR GUY SO ONCE YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT. GET ON THAT [inaudible] THE RESULT. I HAVE A QUESTIONS MORE LOCAL HERE MY DISTRICT IS IS JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THAT MISTER GALLERIES DISTRICTS SO MY ISSUES SOMEWHAT PALE IN COMPARISON TO THE GREAT TRAGEDY. WE SAW BUT IT REYES AN INTRIGUING QUESTION QUESTION THAT. THESE THESE FIRES SHOES -- IS COULD BE THE NEW NORMAL AND WE COULD HAVE MORE ME MORE AND MORE OF THESE AND THERE IS JUST GREAT CONFUSION. IN SOME OF THIS LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ABOUT WHAT TO DO. AND THE THE PARTICULATE MATTER WAS WAS OFF THE CHARTS -- I READ ONE DAY HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF SACRAMENTO IT WAS IT WAS THE WORST IN THE WORLD THAT DAY. AND IT WAS IT WAS WORSE HERE THAN IT WAS UP IN -- PARADISE SURPRISINGLY -- JUST BECAUSE OF THE THE WIND PATTERNS AND THE GEOGRAPHY OF SACRAMENTO OR IN A BATHTUB PRETTY MUCH IN THE VALLEY SO MY QUESTION IS. IS -- SHOULD WE SEE WE HAVE THE STATE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF A STREAMLINED APPROACH TO WHAT TO DO IF HE'S EVER HAPPEN AGAIN FOR OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS HERE. IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS WHAT TO DO STAND HOME DON'T GO WE HAD CONFUSION ABOUT THE DAY CARE MASK ANONYMOUSE BUT JUST FOR THE KIDS IN THE FAMILIES -- YOU KNOW WE HAD OUR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER SAYING ONE THING. OUR CONTROL OFFICER SAYING ANOTHER THING OUR SUPERINTENDENT. YOU KNOW VALUE ANYTHING'S AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE -- THE BEST APPROACH SO SO GOING FORWARD WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR HELP I'M LOOKING INTO THIS ISSUE I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MAYBE -- SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS AS WELL. WELL I THINK THAT LA IS CONCERNED BENEFIT FROM ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO -- WE ARE CERTAINLY OPEN TO HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND THE LOCAL AIR QUALITY ON DISTRICTS TO SEE WHAT COULD BE DONE TO PROVIDE THAT GUIDANCE FOR THE ONLY ACE. BUT BUT I AGREE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CERTAINLY HEARD AS A CONCERN THAT THERE WASN'T -- SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE FOR FOR THE LA SPIELEN MAKE THE LOCAL DECISIONS. SO DO YOU ANTICIPATE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS COMING FORWARD FROM THAT. STATE DEPARTMENT OF ADAM WHAT WE SHOULD DO GOING FORWARD. LEAVING THAT TO US IN THE LEGISLATURE WE WE WILL BE INITIATING CONVERSATION WITH YOUR RESOURCES BOARD. TO SEE IF WE WILL HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY ARE GOING TO BE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE WILL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU FOR YOUR A PRESENTATIONS. WILL PUT GO TO PUBLIC COMMON IF YOU COULD LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS. TO A ONE MINUTE. TO BE APPRECIATED. YOU WANT ME TO GO HEAD. YES TRY TO BE VERY BRIEF -- OR PRESSED IN WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AS YOU HEARD FROM OUR INCREDIBLE MEMBERS YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND I I WANT TO ADD A COUPLE THINGS THAT THEY DIDN'T TOUCH ON ONE IS THE DASHBOARD. AND WE HAVE A SUPERINTENDENT I WORKED WITH REALLY CLOSELY AND YOU CRIER SHE SAID I COULD USE HER DISRUPTING. THE LOSS TO STUDENTS -- PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES THEY REALIZED I MEAN IT'S ONE OF THE SO TENNIS IS STILL INCLUDED IN THE DASHBOARD FOR ALL OF THESE DISTRICTS. AND THAT NEEDS TO BE -- THAT IS TO BE ADDRESSED IN A GOOD POINT -- AND THE TRAUMA AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY THIS IT NUMBER ONE IS IT IS WORKING WITH OUR STUDENTS AND OUR OUR OUR TEACHERS AND OUR PARENTS AND COMMUNITY BUT I'VE LISTENED TO A NUMBER OF OURS SUPERINTENDENTS TALK AND THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR THEMSELVES. AND SO WE YOU KNOW AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THEM JUST MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERED A PRINCIPLES ARE SUPERINTENDENTS IN ANY KIND OF TRAUMA THAT IT ON CARE THAT'S BEING GIVEN. AND THE OTHER THING THAT I GUESS IS THE LAST OF ONE LASTING SOMEONE MENTIONS IS THE CLASS SIZE REDUCTION WAIVER BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO HAVE STUDENTS LEAVING -- ONE COMMUNITY IN GOING TO ANOTHER SAME WITH YOUR TEACHER CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS -- FOR MISS ASSIGNMENTS DOES NEED TO BE WAIVED AS WELL AS I'M IN IN THE SORT OF SITUATION SO WE CAN WORK WITH YOUR STAFF ON A MANY OF THESE SORT OF IDEAS THAT HAVE COME FROM OUR MEMBERS. AND THE HE THE ONE OF THE THINGS THE ALSO THAT CAME UP WERE DISTRICTS THAT REMAINED OPEN THAT HAVE A HORRIBLE AIR QUALITY AND SO WE HAVE DECENT THESE STORIES WHICH IS THE FIRE BURNING SCHOOLS AND BRING HOMES BUT THE IMPACT FOR THE FROM THE SMOKE HAS BEEN VERY. EXTREMIST AS ALL OF YOU KNOW SO SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS REMAINED OPEN SO THAT THEY CAN FEED THEIR KIDS -- AND YET THEY DON'T GET ANY REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE LOS EIGHTY EIGHT THAT OF THE PARENTS WHO DECIDED TO KEEP THEIR STUDENTS HOME. TO THE AIR QUALITY AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT SHOWS TO CLOSE -- AND THEN THERE'S THE WANT TO FEED THEIR STUDENTS AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING REIMBURSEMENT I KNOW THAT'S A FACT AS WELL. SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT HAVE GONE ON THAT ARE JUST OUTSIDE OF WHAT YOU WOULD EVEN CONTEMPLATE THAT. WOULD BE -- SOMETHING THAT OUR EDUCATORS ARE HAVING TO DEAL WITH AS ONE OF OUR SIX SAID LAST WEEK SHE SAID. DORMANT TRAINS YOU FOR THIS AN ADMINISTRATION SCHOOL SO -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOUR YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO ADDRESS MANY OF THESE CONCERNS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
