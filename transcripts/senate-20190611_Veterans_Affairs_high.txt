SO GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS LAST YEAR I REQUESTED AN AUDIT OF LEASES AND OTHER USES OF THE REAL PROPERTY AT THE CALIFORNIA VETERANS HOMES. THAT AUDIT WAS RELEASED EARLY THIS YEAR AND FOUND THAT IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW LEASES HAVE BEEN GRANTED TERMS THAT WERE TOO LONG. AND DID NOT PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO THE HOMES. AND DID NOT APPROPRIATELY COMPENSATE STATE. ADDITIONALLY A NUMBER OF OTHER INAPPROPRIATE USES OF THE HOME PROPERTY CAME TO LIGHT. THIS BILL WOULD MAKE LAW OUT OF THE AUDITOR'S CHIEF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING LEASE TERMS AND ENSURING THAT THE USES OF THE PROPERTY PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE HOMES AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PURPOSES. THE BILL WOULD STRENGTHEN AND THEREBY EXISTING LAW LIMITING THE LEASES TO FIVE YEARS WHILE GRANTING SOME DESIRED FLEXIBILITY FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES. AND FOR NONPROFIT CENTER RIGHT PROVIDING SERVICES EXCLUSIVELY VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. RECOGNIZING THE WAY THE OFF THE HOME IN PARTICULAR IS A SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY MEMBERS HIS USE THAT. PAUL TO ORGANICALLY OVER -- YEARS MANY YEARS THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR LEGALLY GRANTING LONGER TERM LEASES. PROVIDED THERE IS LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. AND ADDITIONAL PROVISION WILL PROVIDE SOME INCENTIVE FOR LEASES WITH THE LONGEST TERMS WHICH CURRENTLY HAVE THE STATE LOCKED UP FOR DECADES TO OPEN UP TO RENEGOTIATE AND RENEGOTIATE THEIR CONTRACTS PROVIDE. ARMS TO THE HOMES. WITHOUT BEING FORCED TO GIVE UP. OF THE LENGTH OF THEIR CONTRACTS. WHICH ANALYSIS HAS ALREADY FOUND THE STATE MAY NOT UNILATERALLY BREAK. THIS BILL STRENGTHENS EXISTING STANDARDS BY REQUIRING THAT. GIVEN USE PROVIDES A SUBSTANTIAL AND DIRECT BENEFIT TO THE HOMES AND ITS MEMBERS. AND DOES NOT SUPPORT THE HOMES FUNCTION AS LONG TERM CARE FACILITY. WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN GRANT AND FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE LAW THAT KNOWLEDGE IS LONG STANDING AGREEMENTS. AND CREATING A RIGOROUS STANDARDS THAT ENSURES THAT THE HOMES ARE OPERATED PRINCIPALLY. FOR THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIA VETERANS AND THIS BILL DOES. THANK YOU YOU HAVE.

HAS RISEN TO EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINE PEOPLE JUST IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALONE. THAT SAME YEAR OF THE MONTH WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF THAT'S WAS IN THE MONTH OF JULY WHEN NINETY THREE INDIVIDUALS THAT'S THE WAY. STATE OWNED ARMORIES HAVE LONG PROVIDED A RESOURCE THE COMMUNITY SEEKING SITES. FOR EMERGENCY SHELTER THIS BILL ALLOWS ANY ARMORY DEEMED VACANT BY DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY TO BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. FOR SHELTERING HOMELESS PERSONS FROM HAZARDOUS WEATHER CONDITIONS. THE SITES COULD BE USED TO SAVE LIVES DURING HAZARDOUS WEATHER EVENTS IN THE SUMMER WHEN HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPOSED.

WHERE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PERSONS? EXPERIENCE ALMOST AS ON THE GIVEN NIGHT. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. OVER TWO THIRDS OR 69% OF CALIFORNIA'S HOME IT ALMOST POPULATION ARE ON SHELTERED. SLEEPING ON THE STREETS AND PARKS INTENSE AND IN THEIR CARS. ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS EVERY NIGHT AND EVERY DAY. ALONG WITH THAT EXPOSURE COME SERIOUS HEALTH RISKS.

IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY VOTERS APPROVED MEASURE H. A SALES TAX. HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS PER YEAR TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. THE STATE ALSO PROVED FIVE THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN ITS TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET TO REDUCE SOME. THESE STRATEGIES RECOGNIZE UP THE ONLY SUSTAINABLE WAY TO END HOMELESSNESS IS PERMANENT HOUSING. SUPPORT OF HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING RENTAL SUBSIDIES AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING OR SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE ARE INVESTING AND AND ALMOST. SKILLING THESE INTERVENTIONS TAKES TIME HOWEVER AND BARRIERS TO PERMIT A NEW INTERIM HOUSING PROCESS AND WOMEN ARE CAPACITY TO BRING NEW SHOPPERS ONLINE QUICKLY. IN THE MEANTIME THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR NEIGHBORS LIVING ON THE STREETS AS AN URGENT CRISIS. WE NEED INTERMOUNTAIN INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS CRISIS AND BRITTAS SEEM TO BRING PEOPLE INDOORS. STATE OWNED ARMORIES HAVE BEEN A CRITICAL TOOL IN OUR EFFORTS TO SHELTER PEOPLE DURING THE WINTER MONTHS. OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN VITAL IN ENSURING THE ALMOST AS THE LOS ANGELES HAS BEDS TO BRING PEOPLE INDOORS AND OUT OF THE RAIN. BY MAKING USE OF UNDER UTILIZED OUT.

WHEN NINETY THREE ANGELENOS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS DIED ON THE STREETS? MOST ARMORIES HOWEVER ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FROM OCTOBER FIFTEENTH TO APRIL FIFTEENTH FOR THE STATUTE. THIS BILL WOULD HELP MAKE. THEY CAN ARMORS AVAILABLE DURING HAZARDOUS WEATHER AS WE APPROACH THE HARDEST PART OF THE SUMMER MONTHS WHERE THERE IN SEVERAL. HEALTH RISKS TO OUR OWN CHILDREN ALMOST PERSONS THE ABILITY. TO PROVIDE AND CREATE NEW SHOPPING OPPORTUNITIES AS THE RECENTLY PERSONAL. MORE BY USING VACANT ARMORIES THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE ACCESS TO SHELTER WITHOUT IMPINGING ON THE NATIONAL GUARDS DUTIES.

MORE MORE RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE FROM FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN TO SENIORS ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AN ALARMING NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE ON SHELTERED EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS DAY AND NIGHT.
