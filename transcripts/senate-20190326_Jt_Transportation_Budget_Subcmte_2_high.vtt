00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.001
DIFFERENCES IN EMPHASIS THEY

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:50.736
WERE REMARKABLY SIMILAR AND

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:52.438
SAYING THAT THE PROJECT IS IN

00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:53.706
CRISIS.

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:55.374
BECAUSE OF THE ORIGINAL AND

00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:57.877
CONTINUING FUNDAMENTAL MISMATCH

00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:00.012
BETWEEN PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.547
AVAILABLE FUNDING.

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:03.282
THIS PROBLEM HAS AMONG OTHER

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:04.851
THINGS MEN A BECAUSE OF THE

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:07.119
MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:08.821
IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:12.325
THERE ARE TWO CRITICAL ISSUES

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.260
ONE DEVELOPING AN AGREED VISION

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.194
FOR PASSENGER RAIL

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:17.363
TRANSPORTATION INCLUDING HIGH

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.866
SPEED RAIL BUT NOT ONLY.

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:22.235
AND TO MATCHING THAT VISION WITH

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:24.036
AN ADEQUATE AND STABLE FINANCING

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:26.505
PLAN.

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:27.807
THE GOVERNOR STATE OF THE UNION

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.141
OF STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.676
WAS APPARENTLY ATTENDED THE

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:32.111
START A PROCESS OF THINKING

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.579
ABOUT AN ALTERNATIVE VISION FOR

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:34.981
THE PROJECT.

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:36.682
BUT IT LEFT IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

00:08:36.749 --> 00:08:38.718
UNANSWERED.

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:40.519
GIVEN THAT THE NEW US DOT AND

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:42.655
NOW TO MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.390
CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION OR

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:46.325
ATTEMPTING TO WITHDRAW OFF OR

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:47.760
REPROGRAM FEDERAL FUNDING

00:08:47.827 --> 00:08:49.161
COMMITMENTS.

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:51.097
CLARIFYING AND COMMITTING TO THE

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:52.565
FUTURE VISION OF THE PROJECT

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:54.100
ALONG WITH A COMPATIBLE FUNDING

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:57.670
PLAN HAS BECOME EVEN MORE URGENT.

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.171
THE GOVERNOR SAID I QUOTE RIGHT

00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:01.107
NOW THERE SIMPLY ISN'T A PATH TO

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:02.742
GET FROM SACRAMENTO TO SAN DIEGO

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:04.343
LETTER WHAT LITTLE LOAN FROM SAN

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.345
FRANCISCO TO LA.

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:07.613
I WISH THERE WERE.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.749
IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT HE INTENDED

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.684
TO SAY BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT HE

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:13.853
WAS REFERRING TO FINANCE SOME

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.755
CONTEXT WOULD BE USEFUL.

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:17.690
A RECENT PROPOSITION IN LOS

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:19.859
ANGELES ADDED A HANSON SALES TAX

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:21.994
AND GENERATED A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:24.397
BILLION DOLLARS FOR TRANSPORT.

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:26.732
THAT'S TWICE THE COST OF THE

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.100
HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT.

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:29.802
EVERY ONE CENT PER GALLON

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.704
ADDITION TO GAS AND DIESEL FUEL

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:34.407
TAXES AS A HUNDRED EIGHTY

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:35.474
MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:35.775
[inaudible]

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:38.544
OF A ONE DOLLAR PER VEHICLE

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:40.313
ADDITION TO THE REGISTRATION TAX

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:41.814
WOULD ADD THIRTY FOUR MILLION

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.050
DOLLARS AND TRUCK WAIT FEES OR

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:45.451
ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:46.719
ANNUALLY.

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.955
GOING BEYOND TRANSPORTATION AS

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.691
THEY DID IN LOS ANGELES A 1%

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:52.992
ADDITION TO THE STATE SALES TAX

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:54.660
WOULD ADD SIX BILLION DOLLARS A

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:55.528
YEAR.

00:09:55.594 --> 00:09:57.430
MORE THAN FINANCING THE PROJECT

00:09:57.496 --> 00:09:58.831
AND I WANT TO ADD HERE.

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.833
THE TWO THOUSAND BUSINESS PLAN

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.101
FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL ACTUALLY

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:03.970
CALLED FOR FINANCING THE PROJECT

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:06.339
FROM A QUARTER CENT SALES TAX OF

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:08.741
THIS ISN'T A NEW OR A RADICAL

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:09.842
IDEA.

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:12.578
A 1% SURCHARGE ON INCOME TAXES

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:14.680
WOULD ADD A BILLION ANNUALLY A

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:15.881
TENTH OF A PERCENT IN CRIMINAL

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:18.250
IN PROPERTY TAXES OR EXCLUSION

00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:20.486
OF BUSINESS PROPERTY FROM PROP

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:21.287
THIRTEEN LIMITS.

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:24.023
WE DEAL BETWEEN FIVE AND ELEVEN

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.458
BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:27.994
A 25% HYDRAULIC FRACTURING IN

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.096
SEVERANCE TAX WOULD ADD THREE TO

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:30.997
SEVEN BILLION.

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:34.000
EVEN AT 2% STATE WIDE SO THE TAX

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:36.235
WOULD ADD TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.370
ANNUALLY.

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:39.572
OUR REVIEW FOR SENATOR BILL OUR

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:41.040
REVIEW OF THE IS ISSUE REAL

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:42.908
ESTATE AND STATEWIDE ECONOMIC

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.044
DEVELOPMENT DOES SUPPORT.

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:46.412
THE ARGUMENT THAT HIGH SPEED

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.847
RAIL WOULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:49.315
LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AND STATION

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:50.683
AREAS.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.617
AND WOULD HAVE MANIFESTS

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:52.718
BENEFITS TO THE STATE'S

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:54.353
ENVIRONMENT AND ACCESS TO

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.388
EMPLOYMENT.

00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:57.123
AT THE SAME TIME IT SEEMS

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:59.158
UNLIKELY THAT THESE BENEFITS

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:00.192
HOWEVER GREAT.

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:01.260
WOULD BE ABLE TO YIELD A

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.229
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:06.132
CONSTRUCTION COST OF THE SYSTEM.

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:08.467
FINDING MORE FEDERAL MONEY WILL

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:10.102
BE A HEAVY LIFT.

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:11.470
THERE IS CURRENTLY LITTLE

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:12.872
SYMPATHY FOR A REQUEST FOR MORE

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:15.641
GRANT MONEY FOR TRANSPORTATION

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:17.176
ESPECIALLY CALIFORNIA.

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:19.111
EVEN IF THIS CHANGES NEW FEDERAL

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.880
PROGRAMS STATE HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:22.314
WOULD NEED TO BE ESTABLISHED IN

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:24.417
THE FACE OF LARGE FEDERAL BUDGET

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:25.785
DEFICITS.

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:27.753
EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS SUCH AS

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:28.988
TIGER AND BUILD ARE BEING

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:31.490
DOWNSIZED OR ELIMINATED AS OR

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:33.392
THE TO FEEL LOANS.

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:34.927
RIFF LOANS MIGHT PAY SOME ROLE

00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:37.263
BUT THEIR LOANS NOT GRANTS IN

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:38.664
THIS YEAR THAN ANYONE STATE

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:40.066
PROJECT MY CLAIM.

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:41.400
IN THE TOTAL PROGRAM IS NOT

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:43.302
LARGER NICK LIKELY A LARGE

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.137
ENOUGH TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:46.338
CONTRIBUTION.

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:47.773
THE PROJECTIONS OF DEMAND AND

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.308
COST ARGUE THAT THERE WILL

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.343
EVENTUALLY BE PRIVATE INVESTMENT

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.179
BUT THE AMOUNTS ARE NOT CLEAR

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:54.513
AND IN ANY CASE.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.848
THE SYSTEM MUST BE BUILT AND

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:57.650
OPERATED FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:59.919
BEFORE THE COST AND DEMAND RISK

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:01.454
CAN BE EVALUATED.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.322
PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS MAY ALSO

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:04.790
BE POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY IN

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:06.392
FINANCING STATION DEVELOPMENT

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.394
BUT NOT ON A SIGNIFICANT SCALE

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:09.628
TO SUPPORT CONSTRUCTION OF THE

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:11.030
SYSTEM.

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:13.199
AT THE VERY LEAST THERE S A GAP

00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:15.234
OF SEVERAL TENS OF BILLIONS OF

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:16.502
DOLLARS THAT WILL HAVE TO BE

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.604
COVERED BEFORE THE SYSTEM COULD

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:20.739
BEGIN GENERATING INCOME.

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:22.741
A SIMPLE STATEMENT WOULD BE THAT

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:24.443
IF WE WANT HIGH SPEED RAIL THE

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.812
STATE WILL NEED TO FIND A WAY TO

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.714
COVER THE FINANCING GAP.

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:30.282
BEYOND WHAT WE ALREADY AND HAVE

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:31.717
BEEN HANDY IF WE GET TO KEEP

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:33.252
EVEN THAT.

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:34.720
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPTIONS FOR

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.522
PAYING FOR THE SYSTEM AND SOME

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.324
COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE OR

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.558
OTHERS THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:42.094
DEVISE WOULD CLEARLY WORK.

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:45.564
THERE IS A PATH IT'S JUST A HARD.

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:46.866
ONE THE PEER REVIEW GROUP HAS

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:48.601
CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED THE IDEA

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.002
OF HIGH SPEED RAIL AS AN

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:52.404
APPROPRIATE PART OF A STATEWIDE

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:54.573
PASSENGER RAIL SYSTEM INCLUDING

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.342
TRANSIT AND LOCAL COMMUTER

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:57.376
TRAVEL.

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.678
UNFORTUNATELY BE A PROP ONE A

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:01.580
AND THE FEDERAL ERA PROGRAM WE

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:04.717
GOT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE.

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:07.453
HIGH SPEED RAIL WITHOUT LINKAGE

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.188
TO THE OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM.

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:11.056
INSPIRING VISION OF HIGH SPEED

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:12.725
RAIL REPLETE WITH DRAMATIC

00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:14.226
PICTURES OF SPEEDING GOLD AND

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:15.761
BLUE TRAINS.

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:17.396
BUT PRESENTED IN ADVANCE OF A

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:20.399
CREDIBLE FINANCING PLAN IS NOW

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:21.967
MEETING REALITY.

00:13:22.034 --> 00:13:23.402
THEN THE ACTION BY THE

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:27.139
LEGISLATURE IS BADLY NEEDED.

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:28.507
HIGH SPEED WILL CONSTITUTE TO

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:30.576
YOUR A DILEMMA OR AN OPPORTUNITY

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:33.546
WE THINK IT COULD BE THE LATTER.

00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:35.314
WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:37.082
WITH THE GOVERNOR TO ESTABLISH A

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:39.151
NEW VISION FOR THE ROLE OF HIGH

00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:40.319
SPEED RAIL.

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:42.321
WITHIN THE OVERALL STATE RAIL

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:44.790
PASSENGER TRANSPORT SYSTEM.

00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:46.592
GET THE HORSE BACK IN FRONT OF

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.327
THE CART.

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:50.196
WITH THE REALISTIC VISION BASED

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:51.697
ON EXPERIENCE TODAY AND A BETTER

00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:53.966
UNDERSTANDING BY EVERYBODY OF

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.334
WHAT WE WANT OUT OF HIGH SPEED

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:56.669
RAIL SYSTEM.

00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:58.437
IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:00.239
A SCOPE IN FINANCING PLAN THAT

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:03.142
WOULD PERMIT STABLE MANAGEMENT.

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:05.044
EXPERIENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT A NEW

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.213
VERSION SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:09.381
A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE

00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:10.950
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT.

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:12.751
THERE ARE OPTIONS.

00:14:12.818 --> 00:14:14.587
THE REAL DANGER IS STUMBLING

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:16.622
AHEAD WITH NO CLEAR AND AGREED

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:17.990
GOAL.

00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:19.792
IF THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT AGREE

00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:21.360
WITH THE GOVERNOR ON A VISION

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:23.095
THAT IS ACCEPTABLE.

00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:24.396
AND PROVIDE A CREDIBLE FUNDING

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:26.098
APPROACH BASED ON A COMMITMENT

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:27.499
FROM THE STATE.

00:14:27.566 --> 00:14:29.001
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW

00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:30.970
THE PROGRAM CAN GO FORWARD

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:32.304
SUCCESSFULLY.

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:33.772
I WISH I COULD BE MORE

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.474
OPTIMISTIC BUT I THINK THAT'S A

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.775
VERY REALISTIC STATEMENT OF

00:14:36.842 --> 00:14:38.210
WHERE WE STAND [inaudible]

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:41.313
THANK YOU.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.983
IT OVER THE OF OUR STATE WATER

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:45.117
LANE HOW LINE.

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:46.051
WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.861
COLLEAGUE AND I ARE GOING TO DO

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:57.529
IT VERY HIGH LEVEL REVIEW.

00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:59.365
OF THE AUDIT REPORT WE ISSUED IN

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:01.233
NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.068
THE CURRENT STATUS OF RESPONSES

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:04.436
THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM THE

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:06.405
AUTHORITY REGARDING.

00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:07.473
OTHER PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:09.041
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE IN

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:11.277
THAT REPORT SO AT A HIGH LEVEL

00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:13.078
WE HAD THREE KEY ISSUES THAT I'M

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.546
GONNA TALK ABOUT TODAY.

00:15:14.613 --> 00:15:15.748
THE FIRST IS RELATED TO

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:17.149
CONSTRUCTION RISK MANAGEMENT

00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:20.286
CHANGE ORDERS THE PROCESS.

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:21.420
FOR MANAGING THE PROJECT THE

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:22.688
CONSTRUCTION OF THE PARTICULAR

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.124
PROJECT AND AS WE CONCLUDED IN

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.059
THE REPORT AND AS AS THE

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:28.427
PREVIOUS SPEAKER NOTED.

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:30.329
THE AUTHORITY REALLY MOVED AHEAD

00:15:30.396 --> 00:15:32.498
WITH CONSTRUCTION PRIOR TO

00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:33.932
REALLY ANALYZING OR

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:35.868
UNDERSTANDING ALL OF THE RISKS

00:15:35.934 --> 00:15:37.603
ASSOCIATED WITH DOING SO.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.338
AND THE THREE EXAMPLES THAT WE

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:40.572
IDENTIFY THE REPORTER THREE

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:43.142
ELEMENTS HIS ACQUISITION OF LAND --

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:45.010
ABILITY TO DETERMINE HOW IT

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:46.745
WOULD RELOCATE UTILITIES WHAT

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:47.780
TE WHAT THE COST OF THAT WOULD

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:48.514
BE.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.381
AND THEN ENTERING INTO

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:50.482
AGREEMENTS WITH EXTERNAL

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:51.550
STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS LOCAL

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.519
GOVERNMENTS OR OTHER RAIL ROAD

00:15:53.585 --> 00:15:55.754
AND UNION PACIFIC FOR EXAMPLE IS

00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:59.391
WHAT WE MENTION IN THE REPORT.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.326
AND BECAUSE THE AUTHORITY.

00:16:00.392 --> 00:16:01.126
MOVED FORWARD WITH CONSTRUCTION

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:02.961
BEFORE REALLY UNDERSTANDING ALL

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:04.930
OF THE RISKS MITIGATING TRYING

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:05.831
TO DO EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:07.166
MITIGATE THOSE RISKS WHAT WE

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:08.867
HAVE SEEN AND THE THE CENTRAL

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:10.336
VALLEY PROJECT THE THREE

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:11.670
PROJECTS THAT WE LOOKED AT

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:13.238
DURING THE AUDIT -- A

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:14.640
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF COST

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:17.476
OVERRUNS DELAYS IN THE TIME --

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:18.744
FOR COMPLETING THE PROJECT THE

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:21.213
COST OVERRUNS AS OF JUNE OF

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:21.947
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE FINISHED OUR

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:24.283
FIELD WORK WAS AROUND SIX

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.851
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.219
WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE THREE

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:28.987
ELEMENTS I JUST TALKED ABOUT AS

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:30.856
FAR AS ACQUIRING LAND -- WORKING

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:32.324
WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:33.325
MAKING SURE THAT.

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:34.893
THERE IS THE ABILITY TO RELOCATE

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.262
UTILITY SYSTEMS SO SIX HUNDRED

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.564
MILLION DOLLARS IN COST OVERRUNS

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.332
DELAYS IN THE PROJECT AND AS WE

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.000
SHOW IN THE REPORT.

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:44.269
THE MOST RECENT -- ANALYSIS THAT

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:45.971
WE HAD SEEN WITH FROM HIGH SPEED

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:48.273
RAIL WAS THE ABILITY TO COMPLETE

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.708
THE VALLEY TO VALLEY AS IT'S

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.810
CALLED THESE THREE PROJECTS AND

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:53.545
THE CENTRAL VALLEY WAS BEING

00:16:53.612 --> 00:16:56.382
PUSHED OUT TO MARCH OF TWENTY

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:57.249
TWENTY TWO THE CONCERN WITHOUT

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:58.650
THAT WE RAISE AND DISCUSSING THE

00:16:58.717 --> 00:17:00.018
AUDIT REPORT AND THE AUTHORITIES.

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:01.587
WELL AWARE IS THE FEDERAL

00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:03.922
DEADLINE -- FOR MEETING THE

00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:05.424
REQUIREMENTS IN THE RECOVERY ACT

00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:08.494
THE ERA MONEY IS DECEMBER OF

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.027
TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO WE'RE

00:17:09.094 --> 00:17:09.895
PUSHING UP AGAINST THAT

00:17:09.962 --> 00:17:10.929
PARTICULAR.

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:13.198
DEADLINE ALSO WHEN WE LOOKED AT

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:15.100
THE PACE OF CONSTRUCTION WE

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:17.569
CONCLUDED THAT BASED ON PAST.

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:19.838
HISTORY AND ABILITY TO CONSTRUCT

00:17:19.905 --> 00:17:21.240
SKEWS ME THAT THE AUTHORITY

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:22.608
WOULD HAVE TO WORK TWICE AS

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:24.410
QUICKLY AS IT HAS IN THE PAST TO

00:17:24.476 --> 00:17:25.511
BE ABLE TO MEET.

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:27.212
ON THAT PARTICULAR DEADLINE SO

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:30.082
CERTAINLY HAD CONCERNS WITH RISK

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:31.250
MANAGEMENT.

00:17:31.316 --> 00:17:32.251
CONSTRUCTION ETCETERA WE ALSO

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:33.685
LOW WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE CHANGE

00:17:33.752 --> 00:17:35.254
ORDERS LOOK AT THE PROCESS THAT

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.822
THE AUTHORITY HAD FOR APPROVING

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:37.623
KNOWS CHANGE ORDERS THEY

00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:39.324
CERTAINLY HAVE CONSULTANTS ON

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:41.260
BOARD. TO ASSIST THEM IN

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:42.795
ASSESSING THOSE CHANGE ORDERS IN

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.163
DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:45.764
THEY'RE FULLY JUSTIFIED.

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:47.299
IN SOME CASES WE SAW THAT THE

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:48.734
AUTHORITY HE DID THAT ADVICE

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.335
FROM CONSULTANTS BUT IN OTHER

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:52.070
CASES WE SAW THAT THEY DID NOT.

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:53.405
AND THEY ULTIMATELY APPROVED

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:55.207
CHANGE ORDERS THAT WERE HIGHER

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:56.875
HIGHER DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAN WHAT

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:59.511
THEIR CONSULTANTS -- SUGGESTED --

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:01.046
AND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR IS

00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:03.081
JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE FOR WHY

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:04.450
THE THE AUTHORITY FELT THEY

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:06.552
NEEDED -- TO EXCEED THE THE

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:07.453
RECOMMENDATION OF THEIR OWN

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:09.087
CONSULTANTS AND WE DIDN'T SEE

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:10.522
THAT KIND OF EVIDENCE SO WE FELT

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:12.324
THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE.

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:13.559
A STRENGTHENING OF SOME OF THEIR

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:14.927
CONSTRUCTING CONSTRUCTION

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:16.929
MANAGEMENT THE CHANGE ORDER

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:17.729
PROCESS.

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:19.431
SO THAT'S THE FIRST AREA.

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:20.732
THE SECOND AREA WE LOOK AT HIS

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:22.234
CONTRACT MANAGEMENT CENTRE BELL

00:18:22.301 --> 00:18:23.469
IS ONE OF THE REQUESTED THIS

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:25.204
AUDIT REALLY ASKED US TO

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.405
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HIGH SPEED

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:27.606
RAIL WHAT KIND OF STRUCTURE DO

00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:29.441
THEY HAVE IN PLACE. TO MANAGE

00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:31.443
ALL THE VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.878
THEY HAVE THE CONTRACTOR'S --

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.279
THAT THEY'VE ENGAGED TO A SYSTEM

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:36.215
IN THIS PROJECT AND AS WE HAD

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:37.850
IDENTIFIED BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE

00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:39.585
WHEN WE ISSUE A REPORT WE FOUND

00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:41.553
SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS -- IN

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:42.955
THE CURRENT AUDIT THAT WE HAD

00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:44.389
IDENTIFIED IN PREVIOUS AUDITS

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:46.291
WHERE THE AUTHORITY WAS HIGHLY

00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:47.826
DEPENDENT UPON CONSULTANTS.

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:49.027
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH IN HOUSE

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:51.463
STATE STAFF TO OVERSEE THOSE --

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.098
CONSULTANTS AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:54.299
THEY WERE PROPERLY MANAGING

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:56.602
CONTRACTS ALSO SOME OF THE

00:18:56.668 --> 00:18:58.871
ISSUES WE IDENTIFIED WERE REALLY

00:18:58.937 --> 00:19:00.906
POOR CONTRACT MANAGEMENT -- NOT

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.875
NECESSARILY REVIEWING ALL OF THE

00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:04.209
INVOICES EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:05.844
PROBABLY THE STRONGEST AREA THAT

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:07.179
WE LOOKED AT WHERE WE WERE

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:08.714
REALLY CONCERNED IS.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.083
MONITORING CONTRACTS MAKING SURE

00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:13.218
THAT THE DELIVERABLES THAT WERE --

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:15.320
DILIP PROVIDED TO THE AUTHORITY

00:19:15.387 --> 00:19:17.055
HER COMPLETED -- WERE OF THE

00:19:17.122 --> 00:19:18.924
RIGHT QUALITY THE APPROPRIATE

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:20.492
DELIVERABLE SO THERE WAS NO

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:21.894
EVIDENCE OF REALLY.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.629
THESE CONTRACT MANAGERS ARE

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:25.364
SHARING THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.566
AUTHORITY WAS GETTING -- WHAT

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:29.234
THEY WERE PAYING FOR SO WE

00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:30.369
REALLY HAD SOME PRETTY

00:19:30.435 --> 00:19:31.870
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS IN THE

00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:34.172
CONTRACT -- MANAGEMENT.

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:36.341
ARENA THE LAST THING I'LL TALK

00:19:36.408 --> 00:19:38.176
ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO THAT IS --

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:39.878
WHEN WE ASK CONTRACT MANAGERS

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:42.314
FOR EVIDENCE OF AMENDMENTS AND A

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:43.749
REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF AN

00:19:43.815 --> 00:19:45.517
AMENDMENT NOT ONLY FOR FOUR

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:46.985
DOLLARS BUT FOR THE AMOUNT OF

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:48.287
TIME THAT WAS GOING TO BE ADDED

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:49.922
ON TO A PARTICULAR PROJECT?

00:19:49.988 --> 00:19:51.423
WE WERE AGAIN WE'RE NOT SEEING

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.358
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IN MOST

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:55.861
CASES OF WHO REVIEWED THAT WHAT

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:57.663
THE JUSTIFICATION WAS WHETHER

00:19:57.729 --> 00:20:02.434
THERE WAS LEGITIMATE RATIONALE --

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:03.035
FOR APPROVING THAT PARTICULAR

00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:03.869
AMENDMENT.

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:04.670
SO REALLY SOME ARE CONTINUING

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:06.171
CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:07.506
CONTRACT MANAGEMENT THE

00:20:07.573 --> 00:20:09.708
AUTHORITY DID CREATE ITS OWN

00:20:09.775 --> 00:20:11.977
CONTRACT MANAGEMENT -- UNIT

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.846
SUPPORT UNIT TO REVIEW CONTRACTS

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:16.548
AND CONTRACTORS BUT AGAIN WHEN

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:17.816
WE LOOKED AT THE STRUCTURE OF

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.084
THAT UNIT WE FOUND THAT.

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:20.152
YOU KNOW HE SUPERVISOR OF THE

00:20:20.218 --> 00:20:21.753
UNIT IS A STATE EMPLOYEE MOST OF

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.554
THE OTHER.

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:24.489
INDIVIDUALS WERE CONTRACTORS WHO

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:25.657
WERE ULTIMATELY REVIEWING OTHER

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:27.359
CONTRACTORS WORK SO THE

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:29.161
STRUCTURE ITSELF -- WAS

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:30.796
PROBLEMATIC SO WE HAVE SOME

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:32.331
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT.

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:34.066
THE THIRD AREA THAT WE WERE

00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:38.123
ARE UTILIZATION RATE AND WHEN WE

RESPONSE FROM THAT.

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:03.682
THE LAST ISSUE IS THE ECONOMIC

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:05.350
MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:06.451
AND AGAIN WHEN WE LOOKED AT

00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:07.886
THEIR MODELS AND THEIR

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:09.955
METHODOLOGY -- WE FELT THAT IT

00:23:10.021 --> 00:23:11.556

FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO ANAHEIM

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:39.023
IT'S A TO ANTICIPATED TO COST

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:40.258
ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION

00:32:40.325 --> 00:32:41.626
DOLLARS ALTHOUGH THERE'S A RANGE

00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:43.094
THAT THE AUTHORITY IS PROVIDED.

00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:45.630
AND THE COMPLETED BY -- TWENTY

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:46.364
THIRTY THREE THERE'S ALSO A

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:47.932
PHASE TWO WHICH WOULD EXTEND TO

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:50.601
SACRAMENTO AND ALSO TO SAN DIEGO --

00:32:50.668 --> 00:32:52.370
CURRENTLY THERE'S NO SCHEDULER

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:54.005
COST ESTIMATE FOR THAT PHASE IF

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:55.840
YOU LOOK AT PAGE Q. WE ACTUALLY

00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:58.543
HAVE A MAP THAT SHOWS PHASE ONE

00:32:58.609 --> 00:32:59.243
AND THAT'S THE THE PORTION

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.011
THAT'S IN.

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:04.716
KIND OF A GRAY -- A GREAT AREA.

00:33:04.782 --> 00:33:05.917
THEN PHASE ONE IS DIVIDED INTO

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:08.753
SEGMENTS -- YOU'LL SEE THAT'S

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.555
ACTUALLY SHOWN WITH THE LITTLE --

00:33:10.621 --> 00:33:13.558
KIND OF THE THE EDGES THERE --

00:33:13.624 --> 00:33:15.059
THE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT IS

00:33:15.126 --> 00:33:16.994
IS WHERE -- OPERATIONS ARE

00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:18.696
INTENDED TO BE AGAIN THAT'S

00:33:18.763 --> 00:33:20.131
BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND

00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:22.700
BAKERSFIELD -- AND THAT'S ALSO

00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:23.968
KNOWN AS ABOUT ABOUT A LINE O

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:25.203
YOU'LL BE OF HEARD A LITTLE BIT

00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:26.304
ABOUT THAT AS WELL THAT'S

00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:28.373
ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED BY

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:29.307
TWENTY TWENTY NINE AND COST

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:29.907
ABOUT TWENTY NINE POINT FIVE

00:33:29.974 --> 00:33:30.608
BILLION.

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:32.210
AND THEN THE INITIAL OPERATING

00:33:32.276 --> 00:33:34.779
SEGMENT IS FURTHER AND DIVIDED --

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:36.280
WITH THE FIRST CONSTRUCTION

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:37.448
OCCURRING ON WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:38.983
INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.518
THAT EXTENDS HERE AS YOU CAN SEE

00:33:40.585 --> 00:33:41.652
IN THE DASHED LINE BETWEEN

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:43.388
MADERA.

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:44.489
AND CHAPTER.

00:33:44.555 --> 00:33:45.656
THAT'S ANTICIPATED TO BE

00:33:45.723 --> 00:33:47.658
COMPLETED BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO I

00:33:47.725 --> 00:33:48.192
CAUGHT ABOUT TEN POINT SIX

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:49.594
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.396
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO IF

00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:52.864
YOU ALONG WITH A MAP WE JUST

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.031
MENTIONED THAT THERE'S A BOOK

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:55.600
AND THEN CONNECTIVITY PROJECTS

00:33:55.666 --> 00:33:56.667
THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT.

00:33:56.734 --> 00:33:58.369
ARE THE TORTILLAS UNDERTAKING

00:33:58.436 --> 00:34:00.905
WITH LOCAL PARTNERS -- TO

00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:02.006
IMPROVE THE USEFULNESS AND

00:34:02.073 --> 00:34:03.274
FACILITATE CONNECTIVITY TO THE

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:04.642
HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT YOU'LL

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:05.576
HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT ON A

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:07.845
SUBSEQUENT PANEL BUT JUST WANTED

00:34:07.912 --> 00:34:09.213
TO REFERENCE THAT.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.182
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE WE

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:13.451
BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THE THREE MAIN

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:14.685
SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT THE

00:34:14.752 --> 00:34:16.120
PROJECT HAS RECEIVED.

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:18.456
SO THE FIRST ONE IS PROPOSITION

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:20.925
ONE A BOND FUNDS SO PROPOSITION

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:22.827
ONE A WAS APPROVED BY VOTERS IN

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:23.961
TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IT

00:34:24.028 --> 00:34:25.997
PROVIDED TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:34:26.063 --> 00:34:27.498
GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS NINE

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:28.633
BILLION WAS FOR THE HIGH SPEED

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:29.801
RAIL PROJECT ITSELF.

00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:31.436
ABOUT A BILLION WAS FOR

00:34:31.502 --> 00:34:33.137
CONNECTIVITY PROJECTS AND THEN

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:35.072
THAT NINE BILLION -- WAS FURTHER

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.707
DIVIDED ABOUT ONE POINT ONE

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:37.675
BILLION WAS SET ASIDE FOR THOSE

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.343
BUT CAN PROJECTS THAT WILL BE

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:40.545
TALKING ABOUT LATER.

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:42.046
THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATED

00:34:42.113 --> 00:34:43.981
ABOUT FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION

00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:46.050

THAT ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:34:49.987 --> 00:34:51.155
PROJECT ITSELF.

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:53.157
AT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION

00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:54.892
ON THOSE CONNECT TO BE PROJECTS.

00:34:54.959 --> 00:34:56.160
THE SECOND CATEGORY OF FUNDS

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:57.361
THAT THE PROJECT HAS RECEIVED I

00:34:57.428 --> 00:34:58.196
THINK WE'LL PROBABLY BE TALKING

00:34:58.262 --> 00:35:00.998
ABOUT THAT -- MORE TODAY IS THE

THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:20.751
FULLY EXPENDED THESE FUNDS AND

00:35:20.818 --> 00:35:22.587
IS ANTICIPATING MATCHING OF

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:23.654
THOSE FINES AND MEETING THAT

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:26.591

FY TEN FEDERAL GRANT.

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:37.034
THAT EXPIRES IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:37.668
TWO AS WE'VE HEARD THAT KIND OF

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:40.104
A KEY DATE FOR THE AUTHORITY --

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:42.106
THAT GRANT HAS OF RADIO

BEFORE THIS THE STATE CAN SPEND

00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:49.714
THAT MONEY WE HAVE TO COMPUTER

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.182
MATCH ON THE AIRCRAFT SO THAT'S

00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:52.149
WHY WE HAVEN'T SPENT ANY OF THAT

00:35:52.216 --> 00:35:53.651
MONEY YET WE HAVEN'T COMPLETED

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:56.320

OF ALL PHASE ONE WE HAVE TO DO

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:17.808
ALL OF THAT -- BERMAN REVIEW

THAT GRANT AGREEMENT -- FOR

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:23.481
EXAMPLE IF THE STATE FAILS TO

WITH A POINT BY POINT REBUTTAL

00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:42.433
OF THAT -- BUT STILL THERE'S

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.868
SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:44.735
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:46.203
GONNA DO WITH THOSE FUNDS AND SO

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.639
THE STATE IS IS IS WAITING TO TO

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.741
FIND A CONCLUSION ON ON WHAT

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:52.109
HAPPENS WITH THOSE FUNDS.

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:53.544
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR WE

00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:54.979
HIGHLIGHT THE THIRD MAIN SOURCE

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:56.447
OF FUNDS THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE

TRADE AUCTION PROCEEDS TO THE

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:07.725
HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT THIS

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:09.260
INCLUDES SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:10.595

I'M A NOT BEGAN AND AND TWENTY

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:18.803
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SO TO DATE THE

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:19.937
PROJECT HAS RECEIVED ABOUT TWO

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:21.238

IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE WE HAVE

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:28.145
A A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE

00:37:28.212 --> 00:37:30.247
RECENT -- PROGRESS IN THAT AS

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:32.216
STATUS OF THE PROJECT FIRST WITH

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:33.651
REGARD TO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS

00:37:33.718 --> 00:37:35.019
THE AUTHORITY HAS TO COMPLY WITH

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.120
NOT ONLY THE STATE'S

00:37:36.187 --> 00:37:37.388
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:38.556
INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACTORS

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:40.725
SEAQUEST.

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:42.593
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO COMPLY WITH

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.861
FEDERAL LAW INCLUDING THE

00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:45.496

ACT OR NEED BACK.

00:37:46.864 --> 00:37:47.798
WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT FOR

00:37:47.865 --> 00:37:49.600
REFERENCE TO THAT -- AND SOME OF

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:50.835
THAT THE CHALLENGES THE STATE'S

00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:52.370
HAVING IN TERMS OF GETTING THE

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:54.138
ABILITY TO SORT OF A MINISTER

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:55.172
THAT PEACE.

00:37:55.239 --> 00:37:56.574
BUT BOTH OF THOSE LAWS REQUIRE

00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:58.376
THE AUTHORITY TO REVIEW THE

00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:00.244
PROJECT TO DETERMINE IF IT COULD

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:02.013
POTENTIALLY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:03.914
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. TO THE

00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:04.715

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:08.653
THOSE SECTIONS.

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:10.788
BUT IT'S STILL IN THE PROCESS OF

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:13.057
COMPLETING THE REMAINING REVIEWS

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.358
FOR PHASE.

00:38:14.425 --> 00:38:14.825
ONE NEXT RIGHT OF WAY

00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:15.726
ACQUISITION AND I BELIEVE

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:16.761
THERE'S ALSO REFERENCE TO THIS

00:38:16.827 --> 00:38:18.329
IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED AND

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:19.797
DIFFICULT PORTION OF COMPLETING

00:38:19.864 --> 00:38:21.499
ANY MAJOR FAT CONSTRUCTION

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:22.967
PROJECTS SUCH AS THIS.

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:24.035
ONE THE AUTHORITY HAS IDENTIFIED

00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:25.603
OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SEPARATE

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.738
PARCELS JUST FOR THE INITIAL

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:29.573
CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT AND TODAY

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.642
HAS ACQUIRED OVER FOURTEEN

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:32.810
HUNDRED OF THOSE BUT THAT LEAVES

00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:34.211
ABOUT.

00:38:34.278 --> 00:38:35.980
FOUR HUNDRED OF THOSE PARCELS

00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:37.114
THAT STILL NEED TO BE ACQUIRED.

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:39.216
WITH REGARD TO CONSTRUCTION THE

00:38:39.283 --> 00:38:40.985
AUTHORITY -- BEGAN CONSTRUCTION

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:42.586
OF THAT INITIAL CONSTRUCTION

00:38:42.653 --> 00:38:43.888
SEGMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:38:43.954 --> 00:38:45.690
FIFTEEN IS IT SPENT ALMOST FOUR

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:46.924
BILLION DOLLARS AT THREE POINT

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:48.125
NINE BILLION DOLLARS ON

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:49.460
CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES.

00:38:49.527 --> 00:38:50.461
I'D COMPLETED SOME MAJOR

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:51.896
STRUCTURES AND IT'S ALSO WHAT

00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:54.131
REALIGNED A PORTION OF THE

00:38:54.198 --> 00:38:55.366
NINETY NINE FREEWAY -- YOUR

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:57.568
FRESNO.

00:38:57.635 --> 00:38:59.170
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX WE

00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:00.971
HIGHLIGHT FOR MAJOR ISSUES FOR

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:02.373
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.108
THE FIRST ONE IS THAT THE

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:05.643
PROJECT FACES A SIGNIFICANT

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.911
FUNDING CAP AND YOU'VE HEARD A

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:08.312
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ALREADY

00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:10.915
BUT THIS TABLE KIND OF SHOWS

00:39:10.981 --> 00:39:12.249
SHOWS THE NUMBERS HERE THAT

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:13.951
WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL BE HELPFUL --

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:15.986
SO BASED ON THE NUMBERS IN THE

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:16.620
TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.689
BUSINESS PLAN THERE'S A FUNDING

00:39:18.756 --> 00:39:21.158
GAP PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT -- WELL

00:39:21.225 --> 00:39:23.094
UPWARDS OF FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.229
OR MORE -- AT THE LOW END IT

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:27.131
COULD BE FIFTY FIVE BILLION AT

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:27.865
THE HIGH END MAYBE FIFTY EIGHT

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:29.767
BILLION -- AND IF THE FEDERAL

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:31.435
GOVERNMENT TERMINATES THAT GRANT

00:39:31.502 --> 00:39:33.204
FY TEN GRANT THAN THE FUNDING

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.605
GAP WOULD PROBABLY BE ABOUT A

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:36.073
NOT ANOTHER NINE HUNDRED MILLION.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.109
A LARGER TO AT THIS TIME THE

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:39.777
AUTHORITY HASN'T IDENTIFIED HOW

00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:41.212
THIS CHECKED FUNDING SHORTFALL

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:42.213
WOULD BE MATT.

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:43.280
AND THERE CERTAINLY SIGNIFICANT

00:39:43.347 --> 00:39:44.949
RISK THAT THE STATE WOULD HAVE

00:39:45.015 --> 00:39:46.317
TO COVER THE SHORTFALL I'M

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:47.518
PRIVATE FUNDING HASN'T YET

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:49.954
EMERGED -- SO IT'S LIKELY THAT

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.021
THE STATE THROUGH THE GENERAL

00:39:51.088 --> 00:39:53.090
FUND OR THROUGH SOME OTHER --

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:54.024
MEANS IF THERE'S ANOTHER

00:39:54.091 --> 00:39:55.760
AVAILABLE FUNDING SOURCES WOULD

00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:57.394
LIKELY HAVE TO COVER THAT.

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:58.562
ALSO WE WOULD KNOW THAT THEIR

00:39:58.629 --> 00:40:00.631
SIGNIFICANT -- UNCERTAINTY ABOUT

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:02.366
THAT THIS COST ESTIMATE -- THIS

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:03.901
IS A VERY LARGE CONSTRUCTION

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:05.336
PROJECT THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS

00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:07.104
CAMERON -- AND YOU EXPERIENCE

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:09.740
COST OVERRUNS AND SO -- THERE'S

00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:14.311
CERTAINLY A RISK THAT THAT THE

00:40:14.378 --> 00:40:18.215
COST COULD BE ON THE HANDS

00:40:18.282 --> 00:40:20.217
FEDERATION ONE OF THEM IS THE

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:21.786
PEER REVIEW GROUPS CONSISTS

00:40:21.852 --> 00:40:23.354
CONCERNS ABOUT WHICH MISTER

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.622
THOMPSON MENTIONED --

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:27.091
ESSENTIALLY FOCUSING ON THE

00:40:27.158 --> 00:40:29.660
CHALLENGE OF OF MOVING FORWARD

00:40:29.727 --> 00:40:31.595
WITHOUT A RELIABLE AN ADEQUATE

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:32.997
FUNDING STREAM FOR THE PROJECT

00:40:33.063 --> 00:40:35.199
GIVEN THAT AND GIVEN THAT

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:36.300
FUNDING GAP THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:37.601
ALSO THE PEER REVIEW GROUP DID

00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:39.770
IDENTIFY SOME POTENTIAL OPTIONS

00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:41.172
FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION.

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:43.407
I I I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THOSE

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:45.142
WORK AS EARLY -- TOTALLY

00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:46.110
COMPREHENSIVE THERE ARE SOME

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:47.845
THINGS TO START THE CONVERSATION

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:51.382
ABOUT WHAT COULD BE DONE

00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:51.916
CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:53.217
OPTIONS AS WELL -- THE NEXT

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:54.118
ISSUE THAT WE WANTED TO

00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:55.219
HIGHLIGHT IS THE GOVERNOR THE

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:57.154
SHIFT THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS --

00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:58.489
HAS INDICATED HE'S MAKING IN

00:40:58.556 --> 00:41:00.524
TERMS OF HIS HIS APPROACH TO

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:02.359
THIS PROJECT IN THAT STATE OF

00:41:02.426 --> 00:41:03.327
THE STATE ADDRESS.

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:04.461
A AS IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT A

00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:05.329
GREAT LIKE THERE'S SOME

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:07.631
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT

00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:09.300
THAT -- YOU APPROACH IS GOING TO

00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:11.702
LOOK LIKE -- HE DID MENTION THAT

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:13.637
THE PROJECT AS PLAN WOULD COST

00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:15.606
TO MATCH AND TAKE TOO LONG --

00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:17.274
AND HE EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR

00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:18.742
STARTING WITH THIS MERCED TO

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:21.545
BAKERSFIELD SECTIONS THAT EXPECT.

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:23.214
LARGER STRETCH THAN THE INITIAL

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.115
CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT BUT NOT THE

00:41:25.182 --> 00:41:25.983
ENTIRE INITIAL OPERATING

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:26.884
SEGMENTS.

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:27.952
SO STARTING WITH THAT COMPLETING

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:29.453
THE BOOK IN PROJECTS THAT THE

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.621
LOCALS ARE UNDERTAKING AND

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:31.488
COMPLETING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:33.490
WORK FOR PHASE ONE WHICH IS

00:41:33.557 --> 00:41:35.226
REQUIRED FOR THE FEDERAL GRANTS --

00:41:35.292 --> 00:41:36.794
AGAIN THE SPECIFICS OF THAT

00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.429
PROPOSAL ARE UNCERTAIN WE'RE

00:41:38.495 --> 00:41:40.130
EXPECTING TO SEE MORE IN MAY AND

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:44.401
PERHAPS THAT OR YOU CAN ALSO

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:44.902
PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:46.170
INFORMATION ON THAT.

00:41:46.237 --> 00:41:47.037
SO THE FOURTH ISSUE -- THAT WE

00:41:47.104 --> 00:41:47.838
REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.073
LEGISLATURE'S A CONSIDERATION IS

00:41:49.139 --> 00:41:52.843
THAT THIS SHIFT IN AN PLAN AND

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:53.911
APPROACH THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:55.846
MAKING WE THINK REALLY PROVIDES

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:57.047
THE LEGISLATURE WITH AN

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:58.315
OPPORTUNITY A STEP BACK.

00:41:58.382 --> 00:41:59.917
AND CONSIDER.

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:00.885
WHAT IT WOULD LIKE TO DO AND HOW

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:01.952
THE PROJECT WISE WITH ITS

00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:03.621
PRIORITIES -- GIVEN THE

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:05.022
SIGNIFICANT FUNDING GAP WE DO

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:06.624
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.058
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER --

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:09.793
WHETHER IT'S COMFORTABLE FINDING

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.394
THOSE REVENUES WHEN THEY'RE

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:12.162
CERTAINLY A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:13.230
THEY COULD BE GENERATED

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:13.931
ADDITIONAL REVENUE COULD BE

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:15.432
GENERATED ORG OR OTHER

00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:17.034
PRIORITIES COULD BE SHIFTED.

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:17.968
BUT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT FUNDING

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:19.403
GAP AND SO THE LEGISLATURE WANT

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.071
TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER IT IS

00:42:21.138 --> 00:42:21.639
COMFORTABLE PROVIDING THOSE

00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:24.341
FUNDS -- IF NOT IT WILL WANT TO

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:25.142
CONSIDER.

00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:26.277
VARIOUS OTHER APPROACHES AND

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:27.912
THAT THAT COULD BE THE GOT WHAT

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:29.680
THE GOVERNOR HAS SUGGESTED IT

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:30.481
COULD BE ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES

00:42:30.547 --> 00:42:31.849
THE PEER REVIEW GROUP BOB

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:32.816
POINTED OUT.

00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:33.784
IT COULD BE SOME ALTERNATIVE

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:36.053
APPROACH -- BUT WE DO THINK THAT

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.855
IT MAKES SENSE TO TRY.

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:39.924
TO MAKE SOME -- SOME CLEAR

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.724
DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE THE

00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:42.192
STATE'S GOING TO GO ON THIS

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:43.193
PROJECT SO WE DON'T END UP I'M

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.728
SPENDING MONEY ON ACTIVITIES

00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:48.165
ULTIMATELY WE DECIDED NOT. TO

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.533
MAKE YOU SEVEN THE FUTURE AS WE

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.068
THINK THOSE DECISIONS HOPEFULLY

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:52.536
INFORMED BY THE INFORMATION THAT

00:42:52.603 --> 00:42:57.808
WE RECEIVE IN MAY -- WILL BE

00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:58.409
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE

00:42:58.475 --> 00:42:59.810
TO UNDERTAKE [inaudible]

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:00.678
THANK YOU.

00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:02.079
WE CAN ASK A FEW QUESTIONS NOW

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:05.749
OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- OF BLUE

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:10.120
TARPS AND IN TERMS OF OPTIONS

00:43:10.187 --> 00:43:12.022
WE'RE WHAT DO YOU SEE AS A BASIC

00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:13.991
OPTIONS WE HAVE.

00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:15.960
AT THIS POINT -- COMING FROM

00:43:16.026 --> 00:43:18.362
YOUR PERSPECTIVE.

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:21.632
TIONS FOR SCOPE OR FOR PAYING

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:24.201
FOR THIS GOAL AND HOW HOW.

00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:26.170
HOW SHOULD WE PROCEED?

00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:29.206
AT THIS POINT -- TO OF DEAL WITH%

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:31.742
THE ISSUES AT HAND THE LACK OF

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:33.477
FUNDING FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT.

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:35.245
OF THE GOVERNOR YOU KNOW THE

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:36.814
GOVERNOR'S TRYING.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.783
TO COME UP WITH A REVISION TO

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.318
THE BUSINES PLAN.

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:42.353
WHAT KIND OF OPTIONS SHOULD WE

00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:44.054
LOOK AT BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:45.022
FINALDECISION?

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:47.157
I WISH I THOUGHT I COULD ANSWER

00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:49.960
THAT QUESTION AND IT AND OF

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:52.896
COURSE ARE GOING ON AND ANY.

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:56.000
USE BUT WHAT WHAT WE RECOMMEND

00:43:56.066 --> 00:43:56.767
pIS THAT YOU ASK THE STATE

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:58.469
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TO

00:43:58.535 --> 00:43:59.770
WORK WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:01.772
AUTHORITY. TO TELL YOU WHAT THE

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:03.774
FUTURE OF RAILPASSENGER

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:05.409
TRANSPORTATION AND CALIFORNIA

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.144
SHOULD LOOK LIKE INCLUDING HIGH

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:08.412
SPEED RAIL.

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:10.381
BUT NOT ONLY HIGH SPEED RAIL AND

00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:11.749
I EMPHASIZE THAT WHAT IS THAT

00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:13.484
WHAT SHOULD THE SYSTEM LOOK LIKE

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:15.219
AND WHAT ROLE SHOULD A HIGH

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:16.120
SPEED RAIL PLAY.

00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:18.789
I THINK THE SECOND THING IS NOT

00:44:18.856 --> 00:44:20.024
TO GET TOO HUNG UP ON DOING IT

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:22.493
RIGHT AWAY.

00:44:22.559 --> 00:44:23.293
THE END OF THE DISH THAT WE CAN

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.995
TAKE OUR TIME WE CAN PLAN FOR IT

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:26.697
WE CAN TAKE SEVERAL YEARS OR

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:30.034
MULTIPLE YEARS IF WE NEED.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.835
TO AND THEN THE THIRD THING IS --

00:44:31.902 --> 00:44:33.637
I WOULD I WOULD CITE THE FEDERAL

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:35.205
INTERSTATE HIGHWAY PROGRAM IS

00:44:35.272 --> 00:44:37.741
BEING ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:39.643
FOR HOW TO DO A SYSTEM LIKE THIS

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.711
AND THAT IS.

00:44:40.778 --> 00:44:42.246
THEY HAVE AN OVERALL VIEW OF

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:43.614
WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO THEY HAD

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.082
A FUNDING MECHANISM THAT THEY

00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:47.284
COULD RELY ON FROM YEAR TO YEAR

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:49.920
THEY HAD TO ADJUST SCOPE TO

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:51.688
FUNDING FROM TIME TO TIME.

00:44:51.755 --> 00:44:52.289
BUT THEY HAD A FUNDING WRECKED

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:53.857
MECHANISM THAT THEY COULD RELY

00:44:53.924 --> 00:44:56.794
ON SO PEOPLE THE MANAGERS COULD

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.262
HIRE PEOPLE THAT CAN TRAIN THEM.

00:44:58.328 --> 00:44:59.930
THEY COULD MAKE COMMITMENTS TO

00:44:59.997 --> 00:45:01.231
CONTRACTS THEY COULD LIVE UP TO

00:45:01.298 --> 00:45:02.800
THOSE CONTRACTS THEY DIDN'T HAVE

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:03.901
TO CHANGE THE SCOPE OF THE

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:05.569
PROGRAM EVERY OTHER YEAR WHEN

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:06.537
THEY WERE.

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:07.971
WERE RUNNING UP AGAINST A HARD

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:10.908
BUDGET CONSTRAINT THAT IS NO WAY

00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:12.342
TO MANAGER PROJECT.

00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:14.578
SO -- WHICH OF THE ALTERNATIVES

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:16.413
I SUGGESTED I THINK DEPENDS ON

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.815
WHICH JERRY WANT TO HIDE BEHIND

00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:20.250
BUT BUT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER

00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:22.252
SOME STABLE SOURCE AND

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:24.621
PREDICTABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING SO

00:45:24.688 --> 00:45:26.757
THAT THE PROJECT CAN BE MANAGED

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:28.225
RESPONSIBLY.

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:32.429
IS IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL.

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:34.665
I LIKE THIS STATE ORDER QUESTION --

00:45:34.731 --> 00:45:37.868
OF DO YOU SEE PROGRESS -- ARE

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:39.736
YOU SATISFIED THE PROGRESS IN

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:42.172

00:45:52.716 --> 00:45:56.220
AUDIT.

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:57.721
SO MR TRAIL OF FEEL THAT -- YES

00:45:57.788 --> 00:45:58.288
THE THIRTIES BEEN

00:45:58.355 --> 00:45:59.656

SIX MONTH MARK.

00:46:10.968 --> 00:46:12.836
AS I SAID.

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:13.537
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO

THAT THEY PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:17.241
TEN OF SEVENTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS

00:46:17.307 --> 00:46:19.676
ALREADY THEY EXPRESSED

00:46:19.743 --> 00:46:21.845
REPEATEDLY AN INTENTION TO GET

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:23.013

OUGHT TO ENSURE THAT IT IS

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.134
USEFUL AS POSSIBLE TO THE POLICY

00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:46.270
MAKERS AND TO THE PUBLIC SO YES

00:46:46.336 --> 00:46:47.538
THAT THERE'S BEEN A HIGH LEVEL

00:46:47.604 --> 00:46:48.639
OF COMMITMENT FROM THEM AND AND

00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:49.273
WELL THAT'S BEEN.

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:51.508
ENCOURAGING AS WE GO THROUGH

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:54.811
THIS PROCESS -- NOT LA --

00:46:54.878 --> 00:46:57.314
QUESTIONS FOR YOU WHAT KIND OF

00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:59.950
OPTIONS SHOULD WE BE LOOKING OUT.

00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:03.153
FOR THIS PROJECT IN YOUR OPINION

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.657
AND YOU -- HOW HOW WHEN YOU

00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:08.725
REVIEW THE -- THE NINE HUNDRED

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:11.828
AND TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS.

00:47:11.895 --> 00:47:14.898
THAT -- IS BEING JEOPARDIZED AT

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:15.999
THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:18.669
DO YOU SEE ANY AVENUES.

00:47:18.735 --> 00:47:22.206
FOR OF MAKING SURE THAT -- JUST

00:47:22.272 --> 00:47:24.641
ON A LOGICAL BASIS -- THAT WE

00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:25.876
MEET HE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

00:47:25.943 --> 00:47:27.811
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:32.416
TO OF RETAIN THAT THOSE FUNDS --

00:47:32.482 --> 00:47:35.018
THAT SEEM TO BE IN JEOPARDY.

00:47:35.085 --> 00:47:36.920
OUR N. IN ON TALK I I DON'T I

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:37.454
DON'T WANT TO ADD A SHIP

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:38.789
QUESTION FROM A POLITICAL

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:39.957
STANDPOINT.

00:47:40.023 --> 00:47:41.892
BUT A RATIONAL STAFFS EMPLOYED

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:42.492
OKAY.

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:45.696
DO WE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS IS

00:47:45.762 --> 00:47:47.164
IT.

00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:48.232
THE PROCESS NORMALLY. TO TO SIT

00:47:48.298 --> 00:47:50.367
DOWN AND WORK OUT THE THESE

00:47:50.434 --> 00:47:54.104
KINDS OF THINGS -- AND HOW HOW.

00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:56.006
HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO MEETING THE

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:57.341
REQUIREMENTS IN THOSE GRANT

00:47:57.407 --> 00:47:59.576
AGREEMENTS?

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:01.345
SO -- WITH REGARD TO YOUR FIRST

00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:02.980
QUESTION IT SEEMS LIKE ALL THE

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:04.548
OPTION SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE IN

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:06.817
TERMS OF PROCEEDING -- AND SOME

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:08.952
OF THEM HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED --

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:10.854
BY OTHERS I'D BE THE GOVERNOR'S

00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:12.856
SERVED IDEA FOR EXAMPLE GOING

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:14.391
FOR MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD THAT'S

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:15.726
THAT'S CERTAINLY AN OPTION THAT

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:18.228
WOULD CONNECT TO THE A STRAIN TO

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:20.063
POTENTIALLY BECAUSE THE ACE --

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.032
CURRENT DAYS TRAIN IS EXPECTED

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:24.034
TO EXTENDED SERVICE TO MERCED SO

00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:25.335
THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME

00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:26.436
ADDITIONAL CONNECTIVITY OF IT

00:48:26.503 --> 00:48:28.939
WOULD ALSO PROBABLY BE KIND OF

00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:30.574
WITHIN THE RANGE OF OF THE

00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:31.942
AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT THAT.

00:48:32.009 --> 00:48:33.510
IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THE

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:34.711
PROJECT AND THEN CONNECTING DOWN

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:36.213
TO BAKERSFIELD WOULD CONNECT TO

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.081
ANOTHER -- KIND POPULATION

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.583
CENTER SO THAT'S WHAT CERTAINLY

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.285
ONE OPTION IS CERTAINLY NOT THE

00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:43.353
ONLY OPTION -- THE PART AT THE

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.355
STATE COULD -- STOP AFTER THE

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:46.690
INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT AND

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:49.226
WE COULD TIE IN TO THE TO THE

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:50.827
EXISTING SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:51.995
THAT'S ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:53.130
THE PEER REVIEW GROUP I

00:48:53.196 --> 00:48:55.332
MENTIONED -- ADDITIONALLY YOU

00:48:55.399 --> 00:48:56.667
COULD TAKE ONE OF THOSE I MEAN

00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:57.334
YOU COULD JUST EXTEND UP DIDN'T

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:58.902
MERCED OR JUST DOWN TO

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:00.504
BAKERSFIELD -- YOU COULD DO MORE

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:03.106
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BAY AREA OR

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:04.608
IN THE LA AREA -- I MEAN THERE

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:06.109
ARE A WHOLE HOST YOU COULD

00:49:06.176 --> 00:49:07.744
IMPROVE SERVICE SACRAMENTO -- SO

00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:09.513
I THINK THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST

00:49:09.579 --> 00:49:10.781
OF DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES THAT

00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:12.449
ARE AVAILABLE AND THAT THE

00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:13.016
LEGISLATURE PROBABLY SHOULD

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:15.952
CONSIDER-- IT DOES SEEM LIKE.

00:49:16.019 --> 00:49:17.721
WE WILL HAVE HOPEFULLY MORE

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:18.722
INFORMATION IN MAY FOR THERE'S

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:20.257
SUPPOSED TO BE AN EARLY TRAIN

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:21.958
OPERATOR OF PROVIDING

00:49:22.025 --> 00:49:24.961
INFORMATION ON RIDERSHIP ON

00:49:25.028 --> 00:49:27.597
THROUGH FEASIBILITY -- ISSUES OF

00:49:27.664 --> 00:49:28.699
FOR SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT

00:49:28.765 --> 00:49:31.134
OPTIONS AND SO I THINK OUR HOPE

00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:33.070
IS THAT THE INFORMATION THAT'S

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:35.272
PROVIDED IN MAY WILL HELP INFORM

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:37.808
THE LEGISLATURE'S DECISION ABOUT

00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:39.309
WHICH OF THESE OPTIONS TO PURSUE.

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:40.444
ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO BE A

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.846
POLICY CHOICE THINKING ABOUT THE

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:44.581
RELATIVE COST OF THOSE -- AND

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:46.049
THERE'S YOU KNOW QUITE A BIT OF

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:47.684
DIFFERENCE IN COST TO THERE AS

00:49:47.751 --> 00:49:48.952
WELL AS THE MOBILITY BENEFITS

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:50.354
AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.888
AND OTHER KINDS OF ECONOMIC

00:49:51.955 --> 00:49:53.190
BENEFITS.

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:54.958
OF FOR THESE IT PRIDE IF YOU

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:55.926
KNOW THIS PROJECT VERSES YOU

00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:57.928
KNOW WHAT THE OPPORTUNITY COST

00:49:57.994 --> 00:50:05.736
OF THESE BUTTONS -- WHAT ARE THE

00:50:05.802 --> 00:50:06.737
OTHER KINDS OF IMPROVEMENTS I

00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:07.637
THINK -- MISTER THOMPSON'S

00:50:07.704 --> 00:50:08.271
COMMENT TO ABOUT HOW THIS FITS

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:09.873
IN WITH THE THE STATE'S LARGER

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.208
WELL PLANS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE

00:50:11.274 --> 00:50:12.342
SO I THINK ALL THOSE THINGS --

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:13.076
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PROBABLY

00:50:13.143 --> 00:50:14.111
NONE OF THESE OPTIONS SHOULD BE

00:50:14.177 --> 00:50:14.978
OFF THE TABLE -- IT'S ONE OF

00:50:15.045 --> 00:50:15.645
THOSE THINGS THAT WE WE PROBABLY

00:50:15.712 --> 00:50:16.279
JUST NEED TO SORT OF STEP BACK

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:17.948
AND THINK ABOUT -- GOING FORWARD

00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:19.249
WHICH ONE MEET THE STATE'S NEEDS

00:50:19.316 --> 00:50:20.817
THE PAST IN WHICH ONE MATCHES UP

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.652
BEST WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:24.554
FOR THOSE FUNDS -- WITH REGARD

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:25.622
TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION ABOUT

00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:27.257
THE NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE

00:50:27.324 --> 00:50:28.992
MILLION OF THE AUTHORITY DID

00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:31.061
PROVIDE A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE

00:50:31.128 --> 00:50:32.996
UPPER BOTTLES TO THE FEDERAL

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:34.097
GOVERNMENT'S.

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:36.433
A LETTER AND REALLY -- KIND OF

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.502
OUTLINED ALL OF THE THINGS THAT

00:50:38.568 --> 00:50:41.037
THE STATE HAS DONE -- SO I THINK

00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:43.039
THAT IT SEEMS THAT THEY PROVIDED

00:50:43.106 --> 00:50:44.241
A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:46.109
DESCRIPTION OF SOME OF THE

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:48.211
THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE THAT SEEM

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:48.745
TO BE COUNTER TO WHAT THE

00:50:48.812 --> 00:50:51.081
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- HAD ARGUED

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:53.550
AND AT LEAST I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:55.752
BUT IT SEEMED LIKE THEY MADE

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:57.320
SOME SOME PRETTY -- PRETTY

00:50:57.387 --> 00:50:59.389
STRONG ARGUMENTS ON THAT POINT

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:01.425
OF COURSE THERE IS SOME -- THE

00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:02.859
WAY THAT THE GRANT AGREEMENT IS

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:04.428
WRITTEN PROVIDE SOME KIND OF

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:06.096
GRAY AREA WHAT IS REASONABLE

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:07.731
PROGRESS I'M AGAIN NOT AN

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:08.999
ATTORNEY BUT IT SEEMS LIKE

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:10.734
REASONABLE MINDS CAN DISAGREE

00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:12.169
ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES

00:51:12.235 --> 00:51:14.171
REASONABLE PROGRESS AND SO.

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:16.306
SOME OF IT MAY ULTIMATELY BE --

00:51:16.373 --> 00:51:17.574
YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY MAY

00:51:17.641 --> 00:51:19.576
ULTIMATELY BE LITIGATED IF

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:20.744
ULTIMATELY THE FEDERAL

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:22.145
GOVERNMENT DECIDES.

00:51:22.212 --> 00:51:23.847
TO CONTINUE FORWARD WITH THAT

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:25.849
PATH AND THEN IT WOULD BE --

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:28.018
ANNA HE WOULD BE A CHALLENGER --

00:51:28.084 --> 00:51:28.685
HE WOULD COULD MAKE THAT

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:30.287
DETERMINATION BUT IT DOES SEEM

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:31.855
THAT THE STATE HAS ON AT THE

00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:33.824
AUTHORITY HAS HAS PUT TOGETHER A

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.059
PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE REBUTTAL.

00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:37.928
TO THOSE ARGUMENTS -- IN TERMS

00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:45.402
OF THE THE STATUS OF THAT --

00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:46.703
JUST BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:49.005
PERHAPS SOME OF YOU CAN COMMENT --

00:51:49.072 --> 00:51:51.408
WHEN THERE'S?

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:52.776
THESE KIND OF MAYBE

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.978
DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT.

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:57.814
THE GRANT CONDITIONS.

00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:59.015
AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BASED

00:51:59.082 --> 00:52:00.550
ON MY EXPERIENCE THE SIT DOWN

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:02.319
WORK COME OUT.

00:52:02.385 --> 00:52:04.788
AND THEN THEY HAVE A A LIKED OUT

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:05.989
FIRST BEFORE.

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:09.526
THERE'S SOME KIND OF CONCLUSION --

00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:11.795
A KIND OF APPROACH WHERE THEY

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:12.429
JUST SAY THE GRANTS GOING TO BE

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:16.366
CANCELLED -- I THINK THAT PART

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:17.868
OF THE DISCUSSION IS KIND OF

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:23.740
MISSING HERE -- AND THAT'S WHY I

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:26.743
ASKED THE QUESTION OF HOW.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.279
IT CLOSE THE SEEM TO BE OR

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:31.014
THERE'S THE YOU THINK IT'S WHERE

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:33.950
THE ISSUES THAT YOU FELT.

00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:35.685
OR PERHAPS THE OTHER PANELISTS

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:38.722
FELT THE COULD BE WORKED OUT IF

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:39.823
THERE WAS A STRONGER ATTEMPT TO

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:41.892
DO SO.

00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:45.929
I DON'T KNOW -- MAYBE YOU CAN

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:47.330
COMMERCE HELLO.

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:49.232
I'M NOT SURE WHAT ROLE FAX

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:53.203
PLAYED IN THIS DECISION AND WE

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:55.105
DON'T WANT TO CONSIDER THAT BUT

00:52:55.171 --> 00:52:56.039
THAT THAT.

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:56.873
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.208
POLITICAL SCENE THERE IS THERE

00:52:58.275 --> 00:52:59.209
IS HEART TALKING ABOUT.

00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:00.577
WHEN YOU DO GRANTS FOR A TRANSIT

00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:02.679
PROJECT?

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:03.980
YOU KNOW LIKE IT WHETHER IT'S LA

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:06.049
OR DETROIT OR NEW YORK WHEN THEY

00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:07.784
HAVE.

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:10.186
SERVE A DIFFERENCE ON THE

00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:12.088
PROJECT -- CONDITIONS OF THE

00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:13.557
GRANT.

00:53:13.623 --> 00:53:15.125
USUALLY THERE'S A PERIOD OF TIME

00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:16.626
WERE.

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:20.363
THERE'S A DISCUSSION TO WORK OUT --

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.165
THOSE DIFFERENCES AND PEOPLE ARE

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:23.867
GIVEN TIME AND I'VE TALKED TO

00:53:23.934 --> 00:53:25.769
MANY PEOPLE.

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:28.104
ABOUT THIS OF GONE THROUGH THE

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:29.573
GRANTS PROCESS.

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:31.241
AND I THINK THIS PERIOD OF TIME

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:33.810
WHERE THERE'S THIS.

00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:36.313
DISCUSSION THAT TAKES PLACE IS

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:37.647
MISSING.

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:40.350
HERE SO I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:40.984

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:50.727
A SETTLEMENT AS POSSIBLE.

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:51.761
I DON'T I DON'T DOUBT THAT I

00:53:51.828 --> 00:53:53.563
WANTED IN ONE PIECE OF

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:56.232

WE TRIED TO LAY OUT FOR OPTIONS

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:19.689

DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:39.542
GRANT SUIT.

00:54:39.609 --> 00:54:41.378
I FIGURE PROJECTS LIKE THE

00:54:41.444 --> 00:54:43.146
BOSTON.

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:45.248
TRANSIT PROJECT IN YORK SUBWAY

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:48.084
PROJECT THE SEATTLE PROJECT.

00:54:48.151 --> 00:54:50.320
I CAN GO ON AND ON AND ON WHERE

00:54:50.387 --> 00:54:51.921
THERE WAS PROBLEMS WITH THE

00:54:51.988 --> 00:54:53.023
PROJECTS.

00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.823
LOT OF PROBLEMS [inaudible]

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:57.360
BUT IN EACH CASE THERE WAS A

00:54:57.427 --> 00:54:58.795
DISCUSSION AND THERE WAS A

00:54:58.862 --> 00:55:00.430
PROCESS.

00:55:00.497 --> 00:55:02.465
TO TRY TO RESOLVE.

00:55:02.532 --> 00:55:05.935
THE GRANTS -- CONDITIONS AND

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:07.704
WORK OUT A SOLUTION LIKE THAT

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:10.507
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:12.709
COMMENT ON THAT NOT MUCH ELSE TO

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:13.610
ADD BEYOND WHAT WAS YOUR TIMES

00:55:13.677 --> 00:55:15.311
IMAGE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW HE'S

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.813
HE'S CORRECT IN HIS.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.748
ASSESSMENT -- IN MANY WAYS I

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:20.250
THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS

00:55:20.316 --> 00:55:21.184
THAT PERHAPS THE FEDERAL

00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:22.318
GOVERNMENT COULD IT'S COULD

00:55:22.385 --> 00:55:23.086
CERTAINLY COME TO AGREE WITH

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:24.521
THAT I THINK THAT ISSUES THAT

00:55:24.587 --> 00:55:26.222
THEY RAISED WERE NOT UNUSUAL

00:55:26.289 --> 00:55:29.292
ISSUES FOR PROJECTS -- YES THE

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:31.928
PROJECT'S BEEN DELAYED SOMEWHAT.

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:34.030
PROJECTS ARE DELAYED -- YOU KNOW

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:35.899
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS --

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:36.566
CERTAINLY THE PROJECT MADE

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:38.435
PROGRESS A LONG LIST OF PROJECTS

00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:39.636
HAVE BEEN DELAYED I'LL TELL YOU

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:41.137
THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY YEAH

00:55:41.204 --> 00:55:43.640
VERY TRUE AND AND SO IT IT DOES

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:44.908
SEEM LIKE.

00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:47.310
THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY ISSUES

00:55:47.377 --> 00:55:48.912
THAT COULDN'T BE OVERCOME IF

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:51.681
THERE WAS -- AN INTEREST -- BUT

00:55:51.748 --> 00:55:52.882
BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY HAS TO BE

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:54.250
AN INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:56.186
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- OTHERWISE

00:55:56.252 --> 00:55:57.520
IF THEY IF THEY CONTINUE TO MOVE

00:55:57.587 --> 00:55:59.355
FORWARD -- NEAR MY UNDERSTANDING

00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:00.156
IS THAT THE AUTHORITY IS

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:02.292
PREPARED. TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION

00:56:02.358 --> 00:56:05.328
IF THEY IF THEY IF THEY ARE IF

00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:06.763
THEY END UP -- TRYING TO TAKE

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:08.364
BACK THOSE FUNDS THAT THE STATE

00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:12.902
FEELS A WE WE A HAVE A CLAIM.

00:56:12.969 --> 00:56:13.770
TO THERE'S A MOVIE THAT IS IN

00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:15.371
THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE STATE

00:56:15.438 --> 00:56:20.143
OF CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.010
RECONCILE.

00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:22.412
ON THOSE GRANTS AND TRY TO

00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:23.480
CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE NINE

00:56:23.546 --> 00:56:24.114
HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.448
DOLLARS.

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:30.587
SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE THAT MONEY --

00:56:30.653 --> 00:56:32.122
I I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN YOUR

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:33.923
ARCHER THE GRAND CELEBRATION

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.958
COMMITTEE OF THE THAT THE

00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:36.926
METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION

00:56:36.993 --> 00:56:37.994
COMMISSION.

00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:39.996
SITTING WAS THE CENTER DODD AND

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:43.700
OTHERS -- WE ALWAYS TRY TO

00:56:43.767 --> 00:56:46.369
MAINTAIN THAT -- IF THERE IS

00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:48.204
SOME SCHEDULE CHANGES ARE SOME

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:50.507
ISSUES THAT HAD TO BE DEALT WITH.

00:56:50.573 --> 00:56:52.208
THAT WE WOULD SIT DOWN TO

00:56:52.275 --> 00:56:52.575
RESOLVE THEM.

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:54.144
AND TAKE THE PROJECT MOVING

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:55.912
ALONG SO WE CAN COMPLETE THE

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:56.579
PROJECT.

00:56:56.646 --> 00:57:00.817
AND MAYBE EVEN CATCH UP AND IF

00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:01.351
THE PROJECT ON TIME AND ON

00:57:01.417 --> 00:57:04.721
BUDGET -- AND WE HAVE DONE THAT

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:07.123
MANY CASES IN CALIFORNIA -- IT

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:08.391
SEEMS WE NEED TO HAVE THAT

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:10.360
ATTITUDE HERE WITH THE FEDERAL

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:12.162
GOVERNMENT IN MY OPINION.

00:57:12.228 --> 00:57:13.429
AND WE ARE BOTH NEED TO HAVE

00:57:13.496 --> 00:57:15.298
THAT -- TOO SO WE CAN.

00:57:15.365 --> 00:57:16.599
GET DOWN TO BUSINESS AND FIGURE

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.601
OUT HOW.

00:57:18.668 --> 00:57:21.938
TO SOLVE RESOLVE THIS IT WOULD.

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:23.273
I JUST ANOTHER.

00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:25.408
COMMENT AS LOOKING AT THE

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:27.710
PICTURE OF FEDERAL MONEY THAT

00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.445
COMES TO CALIFORNIA WE DON'T

00:57:29.512 --> 00:57:30.880
REALLY GET OUR FAIR SHARE

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:32.482
ACCORDING TO THE FORMULAS.

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:35.084
OF TAXES THAT'S NEVER.

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:36.686
BEEN TRUE THAT CALIFORNIA'S GUN

00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:38.922
IT'S FOR SURE BASED ON THE

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:40.156
FORMULA ALLOCATIONS.

00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:42.091
BUT WE ALWAYS MADE UP A LITTLE

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:43.493
BIT OF THAT DEFICIT.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.261
BY GETTING GRANTS FOR VARIOUS

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:48.331
PROJECTS AND SO AT THE END OF

00:57:48.398 --> 00:57:49.699
THE DAY THE NAT.

00:57:49.766 --> 00:57:51.734
WOULD BE CLOSE TO GETTING YOU

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:52.969
KNOW THE IT NEVER.

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:56.472
EXCEEDED BUT CLOSE TO GETTING --

00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:58.441
OVER A LONG RANGE FOR THE TIME

00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:00.376
THE AMOUNT OF TAXES THAT

00:58:00.443 --> 00:58:03.046
CALIFORNIANS THE IN TWO OF THE

00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:05.548
FEDERAL TRANSIT FUNDS.

00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:07.617
WE NEVER REALLY RETRIEVE THE

00:58:07.684 --> 00:58:11.421
TOTAL AMOUNT OVER TIME BUT JUST.

00:58:11.487 --> 00:58:13.389
TO BY GETTING GRANTS FOR VARIOUS

00:58:13.456 --> 00:58:15.825
PROJECTS SUCH AS THIS -- ONE WE

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:19.529
MANAGED -- TO GET CLOSER TO THE

00:58:19.596 --> 00:58:20.663
100%.

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:23.333
pHAD A 100% WE MIGHT A FEW YEARS

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:27.971
BUT I THINK THAT'S KIND OF THE

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:31.074
WAY I LOOK AT THIS IN A BIG.

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.343
BIGGER PICTURE FOR GOVERNOR IN

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:34.577
THOUGH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:35.912
LEGISLATURE.

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:37.280
EVEN OUR CONGRESSIONAL

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:38.982
DELEGATION SHOULD BE.

00:58:39.048 --> 00:58:40.116
ADVANCING THE PRINCIPLE THAT

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:42.051
CALIFORNIA FIGURES FOR SURE OF

00:58:42.118 --> 00:58:44.187
THE FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDS.

00:58:44.254 --> 00:58:46.556
AND NOT LOSE TRANSPORTATION

00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:49.792
FUNDS IT'S IS -- IT'S NOT FAIR

00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:52.362
TO OUR TAXPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:54.364
TO PAY TAXES IN AND NOT.

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.099
HAVE SOME PROJECT.

00:58:56.165 --> 00:58:58.968
FUNDING TAKEN AWAY WITHOUT.

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:01.738
THAT KIND OF CONSIDERATION.

00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:02.872
AND NOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:04.641
ANY COMMENTS ON THAT.

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:06.242
NOW FOR CAKE CENTER WHAT

00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:07.543
CALZAGHE'S ARE RUBIO AS ALWAYS

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:09.212
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OPTIONS.

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:11.948
SHOULD OF THIS THREAT OF LOSS OF

00:59:12.015 --> 00:59:14.217
FEDERAL FUNDS TO NINE HUNDRED

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:17.487
AND TWENTY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:18.087
NINE MILLION DOLLARS COME TO

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:19.022
PASS.

00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:20.590
WHAT OPTIONS WITH WE HAVE A

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:23.026
COVER THAT?

00:59:23.092 --> 00:59:26.062
OR WITH THE LA OF PINE.

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:28.498
CERTAINLY SO -- SOME ADDITIONAL

00:59:28.564 --> 00:59:30.800
FUNDING WOULD BE NEEDED -- TO TO

00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:33.803
COVER THAT GAP AND THAT COULD BE

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:35.505
THE GENERAL FUND -- IT COULD BE

00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:37.040
EXISTING TAX REVENUES IT COULD

00:59:37.106 --> 00:59:39.842
BE NEW TAXES -- OR OTHER KINDS

00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:42.278
OF FUND SOURCES SUCH AS THAT I

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:43.112
MEAN IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE

00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:44.447
WILL BE ADDITIONAL FUNDS

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:46.015
AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE FROM THE

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:47.016
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR PRIVATE

00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:48.051
INVESTORS BUT I THINK IT'S WAS

00:59:48.117 --> 00:59:50.353
REFERENCED -- AT THIS POINT

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.788
THOSE -- THOSE ADDITIONAL

00:59:51.854 --> 00:59:53.556
FUNDING SOURCES HAVE NOT A

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:55.058
MERGED AND IT'S NOT CLEAR WINNER

00:59:55.124 --> 00:59:57.727
IF THEY THEY WELL AND SO --

00:59:57.794 --> 00:59:58.461
PARTICULARLY FOR THE

00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:00.096
CONSTRUCTION COMPONENTS SO IT

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:01.397
SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE STATE

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:03.066
WOULD HAVE TO YOU KNOW FIND SOME

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:04.267
ADDITIONAL REVENUE STREAM AND

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:05.868
WHETHER THAT BE THE GENERAL FUND

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:10.006
OR SOME ADDITIONAL NEW.

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:12.008
TAXES.

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:14.744
A SO RUBIO THANK YOU.

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:15.611
NOT A LOT OF PERMISSION AHEAD

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:17.947
COMING OUR WAY BUT I JUST WANT

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.382
TO GO BACK TO I BELIEVE MISS.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:20.316
CHRISTIAN STATED EARLIER I

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.517
BELIEVE YOU SAID ONE OF THE

01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:22.819
BIGGEST CHALLENGES IS THE

01:00:22.885 --> 01:00:24.320
UNCERTAINTY OF THE COST.

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:25.855
NOT BELIEVE YOU STATED ALO THAT

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:27.623
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN THE

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.692
HIGHER AND AND I THOUGHT I HEARD

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:31.461
MISTER THOMPSON SUGGESTS THAT WE

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:32.528
NEEDED.

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:33.596
TO WELL MAYBE THE BEST COURSE OF

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:35.131
ACTION WOULD BE TO SLOW DOWN AND

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:36.799
TAKE OUR TIME I'M JUST WONDERING

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:38.134
IN TERMS OF JUST ANY GENERAL

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.302
PROJECT.

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.870
THE LONGER WE WAIT THEN YOU HAVE

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:44.474
TO ACCOUNT -- FOR THE HIGH COST

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.476
OF MATERIALS LABOR.

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:46.976
I JUST WONDER HOW DO WE

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:48.211
RECONCILED THE BOTH WAITING FOR

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:49.846
THE PROJECT AND THEN THE HIGH

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.214
COSTS HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.849
THAT I'M JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS

01:00:52.915 --> 01:00:54.283
TO SEE IF YOU'RE.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.685
TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT.

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:58.221
WELL IT'S ALWAYS A BALANCE.

01:00:58.287 --> 01:00:59.122
OF THEIRS IS SITTING IN

01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:01.124
CONSTRUCTION YOU WANT IT BAD YOU

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:02.225
GET IT BAD.

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:03.993
AND SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.396
BALANCE BETWEEN BEING PREPARED

01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:07.897
AND HAVING EVERYTHING ORGANIZED

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:09.365
IN AWARDING CONTRACTS OF THE

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:11.401
RIGHT SIZE AND HAVING THE RIGHT

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:13.136
MANAGER YOU'LL CAPABILITY.

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:14.537
AND THE EXPOSURE YOU HAVE DO

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:15.905
INFLATION.

01:01:15.972 --> 01:01:17.373
THIS YEAR EVERY YEAR OF

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.442
INFLATION THIS PROJECT IS

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.711
EXPOSED TO IS ABOUT A BILLION

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:23.613
DOLLARS BUT AS FOR THE COST OF

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:25.014
THE PROJECT ROUGHLY.

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.482
WHICH TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:27.984
ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION YOU

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:29.952
MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT BUT

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:31.954
BUT NO IT'S A BALANCE YOU DON'T

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.823
WANT TO RUSH IN YOU DON'T WANT

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.691
TO GO TO GO OFF BEFORE YOU'RE

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:38.327
PREPARED TO GO YOU DON'T WANT.

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:39.762
TO TO GET PUT THE CART BEFORE

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:42.098
THE HORSE AS I SAID BUT AT THE

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:44.467
SAME TIME IDEALLY YOU'D LIKE TO

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.335
GET IT THE PROJECT DONE IN A

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:49.038
REASONABLE PLAN THE MANAGEABLE

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:50.173
WAY.

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:51.841
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS GOING

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.576
TOO FAST THERE IS SUCH A THING

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:55.144
AS HAVING SO MUCH MONEY OUT

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:56.479
THERE THAT YOU CAN'T MANAGE IT

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.481
WITHOUT THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:01.818
AVAILABLE -- BUT GOOD PROJECT

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.686
MANAGERS KNOW HOW TO DO THAT IF

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.455
THEY KNOW WHAT THE RESOURCES ARE

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:08.224
AND IF THEY CAN DEPEND ON THEM

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:12.462
IF THEY CAN PLAN AROUND -- STONE

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:14.564
SIR GALGIANI.

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:18.734
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- YOU

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:22.071

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.906
CERTAINLY CONCERNED A NINE

01:02:23.973 --> 01:02:24.941
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:27.443
CERTAINLY A CONCERN AND AND ONE

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:28.344
THING MISTER HERMAN I'VE I'VE

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.113
I'VE MENTIONED AND IN THE PAST

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.247
TWO YEARS THAT WE'VE HAD A

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:34.617
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THAT WE NEED --

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:36.419
TO BE A LITTLE BIT KINDLER AND

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.153
GENTLER TO THE FEDERAL

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:41.624
GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT -- TO

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:42.959
LAWSUITS ARE FILED AGAINST

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.193
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE ATTORNEY

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.495
GENERAL FILES LAWSUITS ABOUT

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:46.863
ONCE A WEEK.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.097
AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT THE

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:49.165
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CITY

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:50.199
CALIFORNIA THE FEDERAL

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:52.335
GOVERNMENT IS EXTREMELY STRAINED

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:53.236
AND I DON'T THINK UNDER THE

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:54.670
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:56.139
WITNESSING OVER THE PAST TWO

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:56.873
YEARS THAT.

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:58.407
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:00.109
GOING TO BE ANY BETTER --

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:02.912
SENSITIVE -- TO HELP BEING AS

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:05.414
BILL OUT OF A PROJECT THAT HAS

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:06.949
BEEN.

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:10.253
FRANKLY MISMANAGED -- AND AND

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:11.787
AND NOT PLANNED WELL

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:12.088
[inaudible]

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:16.225
AND SO -- THE MESSAGE I GOT FROM

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:17.793
OUR GOVERNOR IN THE STATE OF THE

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.028
STATE ADDRESS IS THAT THIS

01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:20.963
PROJECT IS NOT GOING TO COME TO

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.331
FRUITION ANYTIME SOON.

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:25.835
AND IS A GIGANTIC PROJECT AND

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:27.303
WHILE I UNDERSTAND HIS NEED TO

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:28.504
COMPLETE A SEGMENT BETWEEN

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:30.339
BAKERSFIELD MERCED TO PRESERVE

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:31.574
WHAT FEDERAL FUNDING IS COMING

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:32.842
THAT PROBABLY WAS PROBABLY A

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:34.510
WISE ALTERNATIVE IN A WISE

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:35.511
RECOMMENDATION [inaudible] FOR

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.713
HIM.

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.982
I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD -- EVEN

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.184
BEFORE I CAME IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.252
WHY WE START A SEGMENT FROM

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:46.923
BAKERSFIELD NORTH -- TO RESET

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:47.823
AND THEN THE SAN FRANCISCO

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:49.425
INSTEAD OF STARTING IN A MORE

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.761
POPULATED AREA LIKE MAYBE GOING

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:54.797
FROM SAN FRANCISCO -- SOUTH FOR

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.832
LOS ANGELES SOUTH THE ANAHEIM.

01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:57.934
BECAUSE MAYBE THE AUDITOR IN THE

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:58.901
ALLEY -- CAN ANSWER THIS

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:01.270
QUESTION THAT THAT IF WE BUILT

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:03.039
THOSE SEGMENTS.

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:05.374
THE ACTUARIAL COST OF A TICKET.

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:06.709
BUT PROBABLY HAVE A LOT LESS.

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:07.977
THAN WITH THE ACTUARIAL COSTS

01:04:08.044 --> 01:04:09.579
ARE GOING TO BE IF WE COME TO

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:10.913
THE CONCLUSION BETWEEN

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.882
BAKERSFIELD IMMERSE THAT.

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:13.549
KNOWS WANTING IF YOU'VE DONE ANY

01:04:13.616 --> 01:04:15.184
ANALYSIS ON THAT AT ALL SO WITH

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:16.686
THOSE ACTUARIAL COSTS WILL BE.

01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:18.554
TALKING ABOUT A PROJECT AS CLOSE

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:19.989
TO A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS NOW.

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:20.923
BUT NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT OKAY

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.491
IF WE INCREASE WE INVEST THAT

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:23.726
KIND OF MONEY WHAT IS THE

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:26.128
ACTUARIAL COST IS GONNA BE FIVE

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:27.263
HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE STATE TO

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:28.798
BREAK EVEN. TO GO FROM LOS

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:30.700
ANGELES TO SACRAMENTO VERSUS

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:31.968
GETTING ON A FLIGHT FOR SIXTY

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:34.370
NINE DOLLARS -- OR TWO HUNDRED

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:35.004
FORTY NINE DOLLARS AT THE STATE

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.839
PAYS FOR US THEY PAY FULL PRICE

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:39.075
FOR THE PRO FOR THOSE TICKETS --

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:40.810
OBVIOUSLY THE STATE IS GOING TO

01:04:40.876 --> 01:04:41.978
HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:42.945
THESE TICKETS WHICH IS NOT

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:44.213
UNCOMMON FOR GOVERNMENTS TO

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.681
SUBSIDIZE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:46.249
IS DONE.

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:47.683
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S DONE

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:50.219
THROUGHOUT EUROPE -- SO I WOULD

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:50.786
LIKE TO GET YOUR OPINION ON

01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:51.587
THOSE.

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:52.622
WE HAVEN'T DONE IN AN

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:54.390
INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THE

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:56.892
AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:59.195
PERHAPS -- AS IT AS IT NAM

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:01.097
SUBSIDY TO OPERATE THE DIFFERENT

01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:02.465
SEGMENTS -- AND HOPEFULLY

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:04.300
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND IN

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:05.801
MAY WILL PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:07.470
RIDERSHIP DATA THAT'LL HELP

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:09.972
UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT THOSE --

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:11.607
WHAT THOSE WOULD BE BUT MY

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:13.042
UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST IS THAT

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:14.577
FROM THE DECISIONS TO START A

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:16.912
CENTRAL VALLEY -- WERE RELATED

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:17.680
TO THE SOME OF THE FEDERAL

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.548
FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND AND

01:05:19.615 --> 01:05:21.617
TRYING TO MEET THOSE -- AND I

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:23.019
AND THE STATE TOOK A NUMBER OF

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:25.121
STEPS AS WAS REFERENCED I TO TRY

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:27.323
TO MEET THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS --

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:28.190
IN ADDITION I THINK THERE WAS

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.226
SOME THOUGHT AS I UNDERSTAND IT

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:32.028
THAT THAT WOULD BE -- PERHAPS A

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:36.098
MORE DURABLE SEGMENT ON SOME OF

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:37.900
THAT THE SEGMENTS. FIVE FOR

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:39.502
EXAMPLE I'M IN THE LA AREA AS

01:05:39.568 --> 01:05:41.203
WELL AS IN THE BAY AREA REQUIRE

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:42.705
TUNNELING AND SOME MORE

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.240
DIFFICULT -- KINDS OF

01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:45.741
ENGINEERING WORK THAT I THINK

01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:47.209
HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE MORE

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:48.210
CHALLENGING THAN.

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:50.479
THE RELATIVELY FLAT CONSTRUCTION

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:52.481
IN AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO I

01:05:52.548 --> 01:05:53.282
THINK THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

01:05:53.349 --> 01:06:01.057
FACTORS THAT WENT INTO THE

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:03.192
DECISION TO START THEIR PROBABLY

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:04.727
THE ABILITY OPERATE WITHOUT A

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:07.863
SUBSIDY -- YET AS A STANDALONE-SEGMENT WAS NOT WAS NOT THE READ

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:08.497
THE MAIN REASON -- BECAUSE IT

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:09.098
DOES SEEM LIKE THAT WOULD BE

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:10.232
MORE DIFFICULT WITH THAT CENTRAL

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:11.067
VALLEY SEGMENT THEN.

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:12.101
PERHAPS A SEGMENT THAT THAT

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:13.336
MIGHT HAVE MORE RIDERSHIP YEAH

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:14.670
THAT THAT CERTAINLY ISN'T GOING

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:15.771
TO BE ONE OF MY CONCERNS THAT --

01:06:15.838 --> 01:06:17.139
WITH IF WE WERE TO GET THIS

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:18.674
THING BUILT ON THE ACTUAL COST

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:19.775
OF THE TICKET IS GOING TO BE --

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:23.279
ASTRONOMICAL -- AND THEN BUT I I

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:23.846
STILL BELIEVE THAT IF WE'RE

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:26.415
pPROJECT I AGREE WITH THE

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:27.550
GOVERNOR WE SHOULD BE BREAKING

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:29.552
IT UP INTO SEGMENTS MAKING MAYBE

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:30.720
THREE OR FOUR SECONDS FIVE

01:06:30.786 --> 01:06:32.421
SEGMENTS AND BUILDING IT AS WE

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:33.089
CAN AFFORD TO BUILD AND

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:33.956
CERTAINLY PRESERVE.

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:35.124
FROM THE FUNDING WE'RE WE

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:36.559
CERTAINLY CAN BUT I WOULD JUST

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:38.794
GET -- CAUTION THE THE THE STATE

01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:40.696
TO STOP KICKING PRESIDENT TRUMP

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:41.697
IN THE GROWING EVERY TIME YOU

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:42.998
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO LET'S

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:44.500
TRY TO WORK WITH HIM.

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:45.868
AND MAYBE MISTER CHAIRMAN WE GET

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:47.336
A SUBCOMMITTEE OF SOME

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:48.404
REPUBLICANS ALBEIT WERE A

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:49.271
MINORITY HERE IN THE STATE OF

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:51.574
CALIFORNIA BUT WE HAVE THE KEY.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.708
TO GETTING INTO THE WHITE HOUSE

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:54.443
IF WE NEED TO GET IN THERE AND

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:55.745
YOU KNOW WHAT WE ALL WANT.

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:56.846
GOOD THINGS FOR THE STATE OF

01:06:56.912 --> 01:06:58.748
CALIFORNIA AND WE'VE GOT TO WORK

01:06:58.814 --> 01:06:59.782
COOPERATIVELY TOGETHER TO GET

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:02.551
WHAT WE NEED. TO TO BUILD A

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:03.486
FIRST CLASS TRANSPORTATION

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:04.587
SYSTEM HERE IN THE STATE OF

01:07:04.653 --> 01:07:07.022
CALIFORNIA SO I I WELCOME THAT

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:09.925
OPPORTUNITY -- JUST RESPOND TO

01:07:09.992 --> 01:07:17.867
MR CENTER STONE -- THOUGHTS ON

01:07:17.933 --> 01:07:20.636
THERE ARE -- OF COURSE.

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.505
SIR WORK HOURS CAN I COME FROM

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:24.807
THE GREAT MENTOR THAT WE HAD --

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:26.175
ON ON EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:27.676
ABOUT THE TWO GERMANS -- WERE

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:29.145
MENTORED.

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:31.747
BY -- CONGRESSMAN AND THEN

01:07:31.814 --> 01:07:33.282
SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:35.284
NORMAN MINETA.

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:39.054
AND NORMAN MINETA THIS STYLE WAS.

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.956
TO WORK ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:47.229
WITH THE THE MINORITY -- A

01:07:47.296 --> 01:07:48.898
MEMBER IN THE PUBLIC WORKS

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:51.233
COMMITTEE -- WORK WITH THE

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.935
MEMBER ON WAS ACCEPTABLE IN

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:55.604
TERMS OF A MAJOR PROPOSAL.

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:58.073
AND HE OFTEN GOT OVER FOUR

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.976
HUNDRED VOTES FOR HIS -- ICED

01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:04.480
TEA SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BILLS.

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:05.514
OUR HE WENT AND VISITED

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:10.386
EVERYBODY'S DISTRICT -- BY THE

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:11.687
WAY I DO THAT IS YOU KNOW.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:14.457
AND I TAKE HIS -- STYLE

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:19.094
LEADERSHIP -- AND I THINK --

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:22.765
PERHAPS WE NEED -- TO GET HIS

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.900
ADVICE AS A CALIFORNIA THE NOSE

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:27.036
WASHINGTON.

01:08:27.102 --> 01:08:29.538
I WOULD SAY THAT -- AND I

01:08:29.605 --> 01:08:31.240
CERTAINLY REACH OUT TO THEM. TO

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:34.276
GET IS A VICE.

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:35.411
BECAUSE HE SERVED DOES SO.

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:39.114
A SECRETARY IN THE CABINET --

01:08:39.181 --> 01:08:41.717
FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON AND THEN

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:42.017
[inaudible]

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:46.155
PRESIDENT -- BUSH OF MADE HIM

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:47.723
THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.191
FOR UNITED STATES [inaudible]

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:52.928
SO -- HE WOULD BE A GUIDE A YOU

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:55.130
KNOW GET SOME ADVICE FOM ABOUT

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:57.700
THIS EXACT SUBJECT SO CENTER

01:08:57.766 --> 01:09:01.070
GALGIANI -- FIRST OF ALL I WOULD

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.171
LIKE TO SAY FOR EVERYONE THAT

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.906
THE FRA HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.408
PARTNERS WITH CALIFORNIA I

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.276
AUTHORED THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:09.879
BOND AND I WAS BACK IN DC SINCE

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:11.680
SHORTLY AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:12.681
HAD MADE A COMMITMENT TO HIGH

01:09:12.748 --> 01:09:14.550
SPEED RAIL FUNDING. FOR THE

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:17.653
NATION AND THE FRA HAS BEEN

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.189
INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING US TO

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:21.657
ACHIEVE MANY OF OUR GOALS

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:23.092
THEY'VE BEEN FLEXIBLE WITH US

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.927
WHEN THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THE

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:26.195
DOLLARS.

01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:28.531
NOBODY IN THE NATION NEW HOW TO

01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:30.065
BUILD A SYSTEM THERE IS NO

01:09:30.132 --> 01:09:31.734
BLUEPRINT WE'VE NEVER BUILT ONE

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.368
BEFORE.

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:34.370
AND THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED

01:09:34.436 --> 01:09:35.738
RAIL AUTHORITY ALONG WITH SOME

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:37.339
OF OUR IMHO YOU PARTNERS FROM

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:39.642
OTHER COUNTRIES WORKED WITH THE

01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:40.576
F..

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:41.944
THE F. R. A. SOUGHT REQUEST FOR

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.445
EXPRESSION OF INTEREST FROM

01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:45.915
THESE OTHER -- COUNTRIES LIKE

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:48.117
FRANCE SNCF FROM FRANCE

01:09:48.183 --> 01:09:50.452
SUBMITTED A COPY THAT I HAVE TO

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:52.721
THIS DAY AND SO I JUST WANT TO

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:54.023
CLEAR UP FOR ANYBODY THAT HAS

01:09:54.089 --> 01:09:56.058
DOUBTS THE FRA HAS WORKED VERY

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:57.493
DILIGENTLY WITH US.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.295
I THINK THERE WAS SOME GREAT

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.597
MISCOMMUNICATION -- IN JANUARY

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:03.332
AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:06.068
REACH SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION --

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:08.304
SECONDLY TO SPEAK TO SENATOR

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:10.372
STONES -- COMMENTS I WILL TELL

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:12.041
YOU WHY WE STARTED IN THE

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:13.475
CENTRAL VALLEY -- THE CENTRAL

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:15.411
VALLEY IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:17.212
PLACE IN THE ENTIRE NATION AT

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:19.048
THAT TIME THEY HAD THE ABILITY

01:10:19.114 --> 01:10:20.783
TO REACH THE SPEEDS OF TWO

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:22.251
HUNDRED TWENTY MILES PER HOUR.

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:23.886
AND THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE AT

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:24.453
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILES PER

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.689
HOUR THAT'S THE LEVEL AT WHICH

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:28.057
HIGH SPEED RAIL CAN BE

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:30.459
COMPLEMENTARY TO AIRLINE TRAFFIC.

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:32.428
AND OR AIRLINE TRAVEL AND

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:33.896
THEREFORE.

01:10:33.963 --> 01:10:36.365
GENERATE A PROFIT THE PRESIDENT

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:37.933
COMMITTED TO HIGH SPEED RAIL AND

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.802
LATER HAD TO SAY AND ALSO THE

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:41.437
GRANTS ARE FOR HIGHER SPEED RAIL

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:42.671
BECAUSE IT CALIFORNIA WAS

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:44.039
ACTUALLY THE ONLY STATE THAT

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:45.007
COULD COMPETE.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.508
AND AGAIN I REPEAT THE CENTRAL

01:10:46.575 --> 01:10:48.077
VALLEY WAS THE ONLY PLACE TO DO

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:48.711
THAT.

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:50.512
SECOND REASON FOR THE CENTRAL

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.748
VALLEY WE NEEDED A TEST TRACK TO

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:54.950
TEST THE HIGH SPEED TRAINS.

01:10:55.017 --> 01:11:00.522
WE NEEDED A HUNDRED MILES AT

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:01.156
LEAST A HUNDRED MILES TO BE ABLE

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:02.157
TO DO THAT AGAIN THE CENTRAL

01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:03.292
VALLEY WAS THE ONLY PLACE TO BE

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:03.692
ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:04.293
THIRD THE REQUIREMENT WAS TO

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.494
HAVE INDEPENDENT UTILITY AND

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:07.062
THAT'S IN THE EVENT THAT THERE

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:08.931
WAS MONEY BUT THE ECONOMY

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:10.699
CHANGED FUNDING CHANGED.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:11.967
THE PRESIDENT AT ADMINISTRATION

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:13.802
WANTED TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:15.537
WHATEVER INFRASTRUCTURE WE BUILT

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:17.606
IT WOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT BACK

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:20.175
AGAIN WITH A PASSENGER RAIL

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:22.378
SERVICE SUCH AS BNSF OR THE U.

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:23.612
P. LINE.

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.948
AND SO WHEN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:27.983
AUTHORITY WAS PROMISED MONEY NOT

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:29.351
ONLY FOR CALIFORNIA BUT WE

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.854
ACHIEVED MONEY FROM OTHER STATES.

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.422
THAT WERE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:35.124
WITH THEIR PROJECTS IT WAS

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:37.192
DETERMINED THAT WHATEVER WE

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:38.460
BUILT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:40.529
COULD CONNECT BACK INTO THE BNSF

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:41.330
LINE.

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:42.564
AND WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:44.400
YOU TWO DAYS IF WE DID NOTHING

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:46.468
MORE TODAY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:48.070
INFRASTRUCTURE STILL COULD

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.838
CONNECT INTO THE B. AND A SEVEN

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:50.973
AMTRAK.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.076
OF CORRIDOR WITH DIRECTLY WITH

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:54.710
AMTRAK.

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:55.911
ONCE WE GET UP TO MERCED WHICH

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:58.147
IS JUST ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE

01:11:58.213 --> 01:12:00.282
MILES AS THE GOVERNOR IS WISHING

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:04.053
TO DO. TO DAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:06.255
HAVE PASSENGERS COMMUTE FROM

01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:07.990
BAKERSFIELD.

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:10.359
CONNECTED MERCED WITH AMTRAK UP

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:12.061
TO SACRAMENTO AS THE FIRST LEG

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:13.896
OF THE STOOL THE SECOND LEG OF

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:15.664
THE STOOL WOULD BE CONNECTING AT

01:12:15.731 --> 01:12:17.800
MERCED INTO OAKLAND WHICH AGAIN

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:19.134
IT DOES TODAY.

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:21.437
AND ONCE WE FINISH THE

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:23.105
CONSTRUCTION OF ACE DOWN TO

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.340
MERCED WHICH THIS BODY HAS

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.342
APPROVED FUNDING FOR THAT WILL

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:30.012
PROVIDE US WITH THE THIRD LEG OF

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:30.779
THE STOOL.

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:32.581
YOU MENTIONED THE COST OF

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:35.150
TICKETS DANNY DO TAE -- GOD REST

01:12:35.217 --> 01:12:36.685
HIS SOUL HE WAS A TREMENDOUS

01:12:36.752 --> 01:12:38.053
PARTNER AT WITH CALIFORNIA

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.922
BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY AND HE WAS

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:41.423
WITH THE SNCF

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:42.658
COMPANY OUT OF FRANCE SOME OF

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:44.293
YOU BEEN WHO'VE BEEN INVOLVED

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:45.160
FOR A LONG TIME WILL REMEMBER

01:12:45.227 --> 01:12:46.328
HIM.

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:48.430
AND HE TALKED TO US ABOUT HOW TO

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:49.932
STRUCTURE THE COST OF THE TICKET

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:51.667
AND THE LEGISLATIVE BODY NEEDS

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:53.535
TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHETHER

01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:55.003
IT'S IF.

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.206
WE INTEND TO MAKE A PROFIT FROM

01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:58.774
HIGH SPEED RAIL TO BILL TO PUT

01:12:58.841 --> 01:12:59.708
BACK IN THE SYSTEM AND BUILD

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:03.779
MORE OR IF WE INTEND TO PROVIDE

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:04.613
A PUBLIC BENEFIT.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.647
AT THE TIME IT WAS BELIEVED THAT

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.049
HIGH SPEED RAIL TICKETS WOULD

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.917
COST ABOUT HALF OF WHAT AN

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:10.119
AIRLINE TICKET WOULD BE.

01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:11.687
BUT THAT COULD GO LOWER OR

01:13:11.754 --> 01:13:13.355
HIGHER DEPENDING ON WHETHER WE

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:16.358
WANTED TO HAVE THE INFLUENCE THE

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:19.461
END. TO EMPHASIZE THE PUBLIC

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:22.364
BENEFIT PORTION OR EMPHASIZE THE

01:13:22.431 --> 01:13:26.568
PROFIT PORTION -- IN NEXT I

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:29.338
WANTED -- TO ADDRESS MISTER LOU

01:13:29.404 --> 01:13:32.708
THOMPSON -- EARLY ON WHEN WE HAD

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:34.409
THE MY VISION FOR THE PERIOD

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:35.911
VIEW COMMITTEE THAT I PLACED IN

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:37.746
AB THREE OH THREE FOUR WAS TO

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:39.248
ENSURE THAT WE HAD MEMBERS ON

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:40.783
THE COMMITTEE WHO HAD.

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:42.451
INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:43.652
HIGH SPEED RAIL IT WAS VERY

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:45.754
EXPLICIT THAT THE INDIVIDUALS

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:48.190
WHO WERE MEMBERS WOULD BE WOULD

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:49.958
HAVE THAT BACKGROUND AND

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:50.459
EXPERIENCE.

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:52.361
AND PART OF THAT THOUGHT PROCESS

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:53.862
WAS BECAUSE AT THE TIME

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:55.998
CALIFORNIA'S HIGHS ROLE FORTY

01:13:56.064 --> 01:13:57.633
DID HAVE EMOJIS WITH JAPAN

01:13:57.699 --> 01:13:59.568
GERMANY FRANCE.

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:03.071
ITALY CHINA -- AND I AND OTHERS --

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:06.208
SOUTH KOREA I BELIEVE AND THEY

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.410
WERE VERY ACTIVE AND VERY

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:10.445
INTERESTED IN CALIFORNIA SYSTEM

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:12.681
AT THE TIME WHAT THEN HAPPENED

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:14.216
BECAUSE WE HAD MONEY.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.618
IS THAT COMPANIES THAT DID HAVE

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:17.519
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:18.687
EXPERIENCE IN BUILDING

01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:21.156
STRUCTURES WERE INTERESTED IN

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:23.058
COMPETING FOR THE CONTRACTS AND

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:23.625
SO THEN IT WAS NO LONGER

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:25.394
APPROPRIATE FOR THE SAME

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.029
INDIVIDUALS TO BE MEMBERS OF THE

01:14:27.095 --> 01:14:28.096
PEER REVIEW COMMITTEE.

01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:30.232
AND I REMEMBER BEING --

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.000
APPRECIATIVE OF THE MEMBERS WHO

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:33.168
WERE WILLING TO SERVE ON THE

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:34.870
COMMITTEE BUT AT THE SAME TIME

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:36.405
DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DIDN'T ND

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:38.574
UP HAVING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.809
THIS INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE.

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:43.412
WITH ACTUALLY BUILDING SYSTEMS I

01:14:43.478 --> 01:14:45.480
THINK THAT -- WHERE THE TIME NOW

01:14:45.547 --> 01:14:47.683
WHERE WERE WE WE HAVE A CAN

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:52.221
SEIZE ON THE PEER REVIEW

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:53.222
COMMITTEE [inaudible]

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:54.356
CORRECT.

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:55.290
YES AND THE CONTRACTS HAVE NOW

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:58.560
BEEN LET. FOR THE CONSTRUCTION --

01:14:58.627 --> 01:15:01.263
PROJECT ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND I

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.664
THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE OUGHT TO

01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:04.366
LOOK AT WHO AND WHO WE CAN ADD

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:05.868
TO THE PEER REVIEW COMMITTEE WHO

01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:07.970
DOES IN FACT HAVE SOME OF THIS

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.037
EXPERIENCE.

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:11.473
AND NOW THAT WE HAVE AN OPERATOR

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.041
THAT WE BROUGHT ON BOARD THAT

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:15.177
DOES HAVE EXPERIENCE I THINK

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:17.946
IT'S TIME FOR THE FORTY TO TAKE

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:21.583
A LOOK AGAIN AS WE DID IN TWO

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:22.117
THOUSAND EIGHT WE DID THE

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:23.051
BUSINESS PLAN.

01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:26.355
AND WE HAD WE ASKED RESPONDENTS

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:28.190
TO PARTICIPATE AND REQUEST FOR

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:29.758
EXPRESSION OF INTEREST WHERE

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:30.959
THEY WOULD.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:33.595
COMMENT ON CALIFORNIA'S -- HIGH

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:35.831
SPEED RAIL PROJECT THEY WOULD

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:37.199
COMMENT WHETHER WAS DOABLE

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:38.667
WHETHER MATCH THINGS THAT WERE

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:40.435
DONE IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:42.537
AND EXPRESSLY -- WHAT IT WOULD

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:45.741
TAKE TO HAVE THESE PRIVATE

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:46.842
SECTOR COMPANIES?

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:48.076
BE INTERESTED IN MAKING

01:15:48.143 --> 01:15:49.845
INVESTMENTS AND CALIFORNIA'S

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:52.114
PROJECT I THINK WE ARE AT THE

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.283
POINT IN TIME WHERE WE NEED TO

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:57.419
REALLY MAKE A STRONG EMPHASIS.

01:15:57.486 --> 01:16:00.422
ON THIS BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:01.790
HERE TO FOUR IS.

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:03.625
A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:05.427
INVOLVED IN PASSENGER RAIL

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:07.663
COMMUTER RAIL -- CALTRANS TYPE

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:09.698
PROJECTS THOSE ARE VERY VERY

01:16:09.765 --> 01:16:11.366
DIFFERENT THAN A LARGE MULTI

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:12.734
BILLIONDOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:15.437
PROJECT SO I THINK IT'S TIME TO

01:16:15.504 --> 01:16:17.673
GET BACK TO FOCUSING ON THE SAME

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.174
THINGS THAT WE FOCUSED ON WHEN

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.777
WE WERE ASKING OTHERS -- TO

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:23.178
PARTICIPATE IN THE REQUEST FOR

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:26.014
EXPRESSION OF INTEREST AND I'D

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:26.581
LIKE TO HAVE YOUR COMMENT ON

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.517
THAT [inaudible]

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:29.985
WELL.

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:31.853
COMMENT IS THAT IT HAS BEEN

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.889
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PEOPLE

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:35.157
WITH INTERNATIONAL HIGH SPEED

01:16:35.223 --> 01:16:36.725
RAIL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:38.493
EXPERIENCE THAT ARE ALREADY

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.362
WORKING FOR CONTRACTORS TO HIGH

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:41.830
SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY.

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:44.099
SO TIME AFTER TIME WE FOUND

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:44.599
PEOPLE BUT THEY'VE BEEN

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:48.570
CONFLICTED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER --

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:50.439
IN FACT THOUGH WHAT THE PROJECT

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:52.307
IS RIGHT NOW IS NOT SO MUCH OF

01:16:52.374 --> 01:16:54.376
RAIL PROJECT AS IT IS A VERY

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:56.378
STRAIGHT HIGHWAY PROJECT.

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.080
AND WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE WITH

01:16:58.146 --> 01:17:00.082
CALTRANS EXPERIENCE WHO I THINK

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:01.984
ARE VERY WELL SET UP TO ADVISE

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:05.587
US ON THAT PART OF THE PROJECT --

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:08.790
HOPEFULLY IN THE FUTURE WE WILL

01:17:08.857 --> 01:17:10.225
FIND PEOPLE WITH THE KIND OF

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.594
EXPERIENCE YEAR MENTIONING.

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:14.229
BUT AS OF NOW I SUPPOSE I'M THE

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:15.897
ONLY ONE ON THE COMMITTEE WHO'S

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:17.265
BEEN INVOLVED IN A HIGH SPEED

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:19.101
RAIL AND ALL OF ITS ASPECTS AS

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:20.902
WELL AS THE ENGINEERING AND

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:22.571
ECONOMIC ISSUES.

01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:24.840
WHAT I HAVE FOCUSED ON IS ALSO

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:26.241
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE WITH

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:28.744
ECONOMIC EXPERTISE BECAUSE?

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:29.911
THAT'S REALLY WHY WE'RE BUILDING

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:31.046
THE PROJECT IT'S NOT AN

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:33.548
ENGINEERING PROJECT AS A

01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:34.916
BUSINESS THE WHOLE PEOPLE AROUND.

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:36.985
AND I HOPEFULLY WE HAVE --

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:39.254
EXPERTISE TO ANALYZE THE PLANS

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:42.290
FOR THE FLOW OF THE PROJECT FROM

01:17:42.357 --> 01:17:44.393
THAT POINT OF VIEW [inaudible]

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:47.062
HI I NEW GUINEA DO TEAM DO TAE

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:48.663
VERY WELL AND I AM VERY WELL

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:49.731
FAMILIAR WITH THE FRENCH

01:17:49.798 --> 01:17:52.134
EXPERIENCE IN -- CONTRIBUTIONS

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:52.901
THAT THEY'VE MADE.

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:55.504
AND THEY CERTAINLY DID.

01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:57.139
OUR AND MATT BRINGS UP AS WE

01:17:57.205 --> 01:17:58.573
LOOK AS WE GO IN THE FUTURE

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.143
HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIGURE SOME WAY

01:18:01.209 --> 01:18:02.677
TO GET THAT KIND OF EXPERTISE.

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.179
ESPECIALLY THE EXPERTISE OF THE

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:05.847
EARLIER OPERATOR FROM THE

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:09.184
AUTHORITY INTO THE FORMULATION

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:11.486
OF THE OPTIONS IN THE PLANS THAT

01:18:11.553 --> 01:18:12.687
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE.

01:18:12.754 --> 01:18:14.890
THE F. R. A. HAD ISSUE THEIR OWN

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:16.191
REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:17.692
INTEREST IN HAD RECEIVED --

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:19.561
INPUT FROM MANY COUNTRIES AT THE

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:22.531
TIME AND I I DO KNOW THAT THAT

01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:23.865
SO MANY ARE WORKING ON THE

01:18:23.932 --> 01:18:25.700
PROJECT THAT IT CONFLICTS AMOUNT

01:18:25.767 --> 01:18:27.602
I DO UNDERSTAND THAT -- BUT

HOURS BY CAR WITH HIGH SPEED

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:25.406
ROUTE WOULD TAKE ABOUT ONE HOUR.

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:26.841
AND THERE'S A SIMILAR TRAVEL

01:32:26.908 --> 01:32:28.776
TIME SAVINGS LOOKING AT MERCED

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:31.045
TO BAKERSFIELD.

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:32.647
THE SLIDE IS UP ON THE SCREEN

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:39.220
THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT HIGH

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:41.455
SPEED RAIL HAS IMPLEMENTED.

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:42.990
COUPLE EXAMPLES.

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:43.991
FIRST WITH THIRD PARTY

01:32:44.058 --> 01:32:45.526
AGREEMENTS HAS BEEN SOME

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:47.261
DISCUSSION OF THE THIRD PARTY

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:49.096
CAESAR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES.

01:32:49.163 --> 01:32:51.532
THE RAILROAD OPERATORS -- THE

01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:53.768
CITIES IN THE REGION.

01:32:53.834 --> 01:32:55.937
AND THAT HAS BEEN AN AREA OF

01:32:56.003 --> 01:32:57.905
RISKING AND COST FOR THE PROJECT

01:32:57.972 --> 01:32:59.607
BUT THE PROJECT TEAM RIGHT NOW

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:01.475
IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THOSE

01:33:01.542 --> 01:33:03.110
THIRD PARTIES IN SOME CASES.

01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:04.445
A REINSTITUTING THIRD PARTY

01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:07.782
MASTER AGREEMENTS OF COOPERATION.

01:33:07.848 --> 01:33:09.417
TO REDUCE RISK.

01:33:09.483 --> 01:33:11.018
HIGH SPEED ROSE ALSO INCREASING

01:33:11.085 --> 01:33:12.586
ENGAGEMENT OF THOSE THIRD

01:33:12.653 --> 01:33:14.789
PARTIES WITH THE FINAL DESIGN

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.190
WORK THAT THE DESIGN BILL

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:17.858
CONTRACTORS WORKING ON BECAUSE

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:19.527
THAT DESIGN BUILD WORK CAN

01:33:19.593 --> 01:33:20.795
CHANGE SOME OF THOSE.

01:33:20.861 --> 01:33:23.564
THIRD PARTY REQUIREMENTS AND AND

01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:25.967
AND THAT PROJECT SCOPE SO HIGH

01:33:26.033 --> 01:33:27.735
SPEED ROSE WORKING DAY REDUCE

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:29.470
RISK IN THAT AREA BY GOOD

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:31.138
COORDINATION BOTH WITH THE THIRD

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:33.407
PARTIES AND THE DESIGN BUILDERS

01:33:33.474 --> 01:33:35.176
AS THEY COMPLETE THEIR DESIGN

01:33:35.242 --> 01:33:36.010
WORK.

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:36.877
AND IN FACT COMPLETING THE

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:39.547
DESIGN WORK IS A BENEFIT AS WELL

01:33:39.613 --> 01:33:41.882
BECAUSE THAT REDUCES ANY

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:44.151
RESIDUAL RISK OF RIGHT AWAY

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:45.820
QUESTIONS ENVIRONMENTAL.

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:47.822
WORKING SENTRA SO ALL THESE

01:33:47.888 --> 01:33:49.190
THINGS THROUGH THE PIPELINE A

ON THE NEXT FLIGHT HERE'S MORE

01:34:02.603 --> 01:34:04.305
SPECIFICS OF SOME OF THE CHANGES

01:34:04.372 --> 01:34:05.306
IN HOW THE STAFF FOR DOING THEIR

INVESTMENT IN SOME OF THEIR

01:49:07.974 --> 01:49:09.776
COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS IN FACT

01:49:09.843 --> 01:49:11.144
SOME OF THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS

01:49:11.211 --> 01:49:13.713
HAVE 10% CAPS ON HOW MUCH ANYONE

01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:15.315
STATE CAN GET AND OF COURSE OUR

01:49:15.382 --> 01:49:17.584
POPULATION OF THE NATION'S ABOUT

01:49:17.651 --> 01:49:21.454
12% SO -- WORD WERE LIMITED AND

01:49:21.521 --> 01:49:23.790
AND MANY TIMES ARE ARE A

01:49:23.857 --> 01:49:26.293
COMPETITIVE -- AB APPLICATIONS

01:49:26.359 --> 01:49:28.361
CAN BE BELOW THAT 10% --

01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:29.829
SOMETIMES SIGNIFICANTLY IN

01:49:29.896 --> 01:49:31.097
DIFFERENT GRANT ROUNDS BUT AS

01:49:31.164 --> 01:49:32.565
YOU SAY.

01:49:32.632 --> 01:49:34.067
YOU KNOW BECAUSE CALIFORNIA

01:49:34.134 --> 01:49:37.170
INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN TRANSIT.

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:38.705
THAT'S BEEN AN AREA WHERE WIZ

01:49:38.772 --> 01:49:40.440
RECEIVED -- YOU KNOW MORE THAN

01:49:40.507 --> 01:49:42.642
OUR POPULATION SHARE TO MAKE UP

01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:44.244
FOR SOME OF THE DEAF SHORTFALLS

01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:46.813
IF YOU WILL IN OTHER MODES RIGHT.

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:49.683
AND THAT'S BEEN THE TRADITIONAL

01:49:49.749 --> 01:49:54.854
WAY WE MADE IT UP THIS TRYING TO

01:49:54.921 --> 01:49:56.056
GET THESE GRANTS AND YOU KNOW

01:49:56.122 --> 01:49:56.957
TRY TO BALANCE IT OUT A LITTLE

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:57.590
BIT AS MUCH AS WE CAN I DON'T

01:49:57.657 --> 01:49:59.025
THINK WE'VE EVER RECEIVED.

01:49:59.092 --> 01:50:00.527
I HAVE HE ADDED UP FOR A LONG

01:50:00.593 --> 01:50:02.162
TERM I THINK WE'RE STILL A QUOTE

01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:02.996
DONORS STATE.

01:50:03.063 --> 01:50:05.098
A TRUE.

01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:07.267
THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT YEAH THE

01:50:07.334 --> 01:50:08.468
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS HAS BEEN

01:50:08.535 --> 01:50:10.303
AUGMENTING -- THE HIGHWAY TRUST

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:12.105
FUND WITH FEDERAL GENERAL FUNDS

01:50:12.172 --> 01:50:14.074
BUT IF YOU LOOK AS A PROPORTION

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:16.109
YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT -- NO IT

01:50:16.176 --> 01:50:18.178
TIMES -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:50:18.244 --> 01:50:22.215
WOULD SET A 93% -- MINIMUM --

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:24.184
RETURN ON SOME OF THE HIGHWAY

01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:25.752
FUNDS AND IN FACT WE WERE AT

01:50:25.819 --> 01:50:27.821
THAT LEVEL FOR MANY YEARS AND

01:50:27.887 --> 01:50:29.322
CHAU AGAIN AS THAT HIGHWAY FUNDS

01:50:29.389 --> 01:50:31.024
BEEN SUPPLEMENTED WERE ABOVE

01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:31.925
THAT BUT AGAIN STILL

01:50:31.992 --> 01:50:34.260
PROPORTIONATELY WE HAVE THIS.

01:50:34.327 --> 01:50:35.895
ISSUE OF BEING A DONOR STATE OF

01:50:35.962 --> 01:50:39.366
THE AIR THE ERROR OF FUNDS --

01:50:39.432 --> 01:50:42.135
SENATORS STONE IN CAP AND CENTER

01:50:42.202 --> 01:50:44.004
GALGIANI TALKED ABOUT THIS THERE

01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:47.073
ARE FUNDS WERE TO HELP THE THE

01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:49.509
THE TIME IN OUR COUNTRY.

01:50:49.576 --> 01:50:52.278
THAT WAS UNDER ECONOMIC CRISIS

01:50:52.345 --> 01:50:53.446
AND WAS.

01:50:53.513 --> 01:50:56.282
TO HELP STIMULATE THE ECONOMY.

01:50:56.349 --> 01:50:58.852
AND IN CALIFORNIA GOT CUT -- THE

01:50:58.918 --> 01:51:00.687
GRANT FOR THIS BECAUSE THE VERY

01:51:00.754 --> 01:51:03.056
AREA THAT WE WERE SPENDING THE

01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:04.891
MONEY IN. FOR THE HIGH SPEED

01:51:04.958 --> 01:51:07.327
RAIL PROJECT WAS ONE OF THE

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:09.295
WORST HIT.

01:51:09.362 --> 01:51:10.830
ECONOMIC AREAS IN THE UNITED

01:51:10.897 --> 01:51:12.599
STATES.

01:51:12.665 --> 01:51:13.666
AND CALIFORNIA'S STILL HAS THE

01:51:13.733 --> 01:51:15.802
HIGHEST.

01:51:15.869 --> 01:51:17.470
PERCENTAGE WISE.

01:51:17.537 --> 01:51:20.640
OF OF PEOPLE IN POVERTY.

01:51:20.707 --> 01:51:23.009
IN THE UNITED STATES SO THE

01:51:23.076 --> 01:51:24.210
ERROR FUNDS WERE MEN

01:51:24.277 --> 01:51:28.481
[inaudible] TO FUN PROJECTS TO

01:51:28.548 --> 01:51:29.916
HELP THOSE AREAS THAT HAD AN

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:34.387
ECONOMIC -- DOWNTURN

01:51:34.454 --> 01:51:34.687
[inaudible]

01:51:34.754 --> 01:51:37.891
AND IT'S STILL IN TERMS OF

01:51:37.957 --> 01:51:39.492
PERCENTAGE OF ERROR FUNDS WERE

01:51:39.559 --> 01:51:40.627
STILL.

01:51:40.693 --> 01:51:43.763
AGAIN A DONOR'S STATE AND IN

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:45.532
THAT PART OF MONEY I I I I I

01:51:45.598 --> 01:51:47.700
BELIEVE IS THAT TRUE.

01:51:47.767 --> 01:51:48.935
AND YOU HAVE ANY CON MISTER

01:51:49.002 --> 01:51:49.936

AHEAD YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT THAT

01:51:54.374 --> 01:51:58.311
THE RECOVERY ACT FUNDS WERE TO

01:51:58.378 --> 01:51:59.379
TRYING COURAGE -- ECONOMIC

01:51:59.446 --> 01:52:00.146
GROWTH PARTICULARLY IN PARTS OF

01:52:00.213 --> 01:52:01.648
THE COUNTRY THAT NEEDED THE MOST.

01:52:01.714 --> 01:52:03.650
THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA

01:52:03.716 --> 01:52:05.218
IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WERE TWO OF

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:06.853
THE HARDEST HIT SPOTS.

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.922
IN THE GREAT RECESSION AND SO

01:52:08.988 --> 01:52:10.390
INVESTING THERE WAS A GOOD IDEA

01:52:10.457 --> 01:52:12.225
AT THE TIME IT'S STILL A GOOD

01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:13.093
IDEA.

01:52:13.159 --> 01:52:14.394
OF AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF

01:52:14.461 --> 01:52:15.528
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

01:52:15.595 --> 01:52:17.097
HIGH SPEED RAIL IS AS AN

01:52:17.163 --> 01:52:19.265
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECT FOR

01:52:19.332 --> 01:52:20.066
THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE IN

01:52:20.133 --> 01:52:21.501
LINE AMP AND AT THROUGH THE

01:52:21.568 --> 01:52:22.936
THROUGH CONNECTING THE CENTRAL

01:52:23.002 --> 01:52:24.604
VALLEY TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:52:24.671 --> 01:52:26.172
INTO THE BAY AREA.

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:28.141
AND SO YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WAS THE

01:52:28.208 --> 01:52:29.943
INTENT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE

01:52:30.009 --> 01:52:31.478
CONTINUING TO INVEST THERE WAS A

01:52:31.544 --> 01:52:33.146
REQUIREMENT OF THE FUNDS.

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:34.714
AND IT'S ALSO GOOD ECONOMIC

01:52:34.781 --> 01:52:36.783
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.

01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:38.451
THE IDEA OF TAKING THOSE MONIES

01:52:38.518 --> 01:52:39.752
AND SPENDING -- WHEREVER ELSE

01:52:39.819 --> 01:52:41.254
WAS.

01:52:41.321 --> 01:52:43.289
NOT PART OF OUR PLAN BECAUSE WE

01:52:43.356 --> 01:52:44.824
WERE INDEED SPENDING IT AT ONE

01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:45.758
OF THE POOREST AREAS OF

01:52:45.825 --> 01:52:46.926
CALIFORNIA CORRECT [inaudible]

02:03:04.677 --> 02:03:06.979
OKAY AND THEN THE SECOND ITEM HE

02:03:07.046 --> 02:03:08.848
THERE WHY THAT WE REFER TO WHERE

02:03:08.914 --> 02:03:10.916
THEY TRAIN CONTINUES NORTH OR IT

02:03:10.983 --> 02:03:13.185
SPLITS WEST. TO GILROY IN SAN

02:03:13.252 --> 02:03:15.588
JOSE -- THAT WHY.

02:03:15.654 --> 02:03:17.256
WAS I THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE

02:03:17.323 --> 02:03:20.426
WAS I'D DONE A FIGHT IN MAY OF

02:03:20.493 --> 02:03:21.494
TWENTY SEVENTEEN DOES THAT MEAN

02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:23.229
THAT THE SEQUEL WAS APPROVED.

02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:24.663
IN MAY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN MA'AM

02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:26.766
ONLY IN THE NORTHERN MOST MORE

02:03:26.832 --> 02:03:28.300
THAN EIGHT MILES OF THAT.

02:03:28.367 --> 02:03:30.436
AS YOU APPROACH MORE SAID THAT

02:03:30.503 --> 02:03:34.240
YOU HAVE BASICALLY SYKORA AND IS

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:35.741
FOR FILLED FOR THAT -- WE ARE

02:03:35.808 --> 02:03:41.147
CURRENTLY PURSUING THE SEQUEL

02:03:41.213 --> 02:03:41.781
FOR THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THAT

02:03:41.847 --> 02:03:42.081
[inaudible]

02:03:42.148 --> 02:03:42.815
OKAY.

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:43.983
AND THEN -- THE OTHER QUESTION I

02:03:44.049 --> 02:03:45.918
HAVE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE COMING

02:03:45.985 --> 02:03:47.920
UP WITH THE COST THAT REMAINS TO

02:03:47.987 --> 02:03:49.855
GET TO MERCED FOR THAT LAST

02:03:49.922 --> 02:03:50.756
TWENTY FIVE MILES.

02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:53.826
IS THAT INCLUDING THE WHY.

02:03:53.893 --> 02:03:55.828
JUST TO MERCED OR YOU ALSO

02:03:55.895 --> 02:03:57.463
INCLUDING IN THAT COST ESTIMATE

02:03:57.530 --> 02:03:58.731
THE WHY THAT HEADS TOWARDS SAN

02:03:58.798 --> 02:04:01.433
JOSE.

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:02.802
BECAUSE EMIGRATE IN OPERATIONAL

02:04:02.868 --> 02:04:04.603
SEGMENT WE'VE INCLUDED BASICALLY

02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:06.672
THE WESTERN PORTION OF THAT AS

02:04:06.739 --> 02:04:08.808
AN TO COME INTO MERCED WE ARE

02:04:08.874 --> 02:04:11.877
COUNTING THOUGH FOR THE TOTAL Y..

02:04:11.944 --> 02:04:14.146
AS WE ADVANCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:04:14.213 --> 02:04:15.648
PROCESS WE HAVE NOT FORGOT OUR

02:04:15.714 --> 02:04:16.749
COMMITMENT.

02:04:16.816 --> 02:04:19.084
OKAY AND THEN -- WHEN WE CAN

02:04:19.151 --> 02:04:21.053
WHEN WE COMPETED FOR THE ARE

02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:23.956
DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND AND --

02:04:24.023 --> 02:04:25.591
NINE CALIFORNIA IT ORIGINALLY

02:04:25.658 --> 02:04:28.627
HAD MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD AS ONE

02:04:28.694 --> 02:04:29.728
OF THE SEGMENTS WITH THAT WAS

02:04:29.795 --> 02:04:32.097
OUTLINED IN PROP ONE NAY.

02:04:32.164 --> 02:04:33.933
BUT BECAUSE WE WERE CONCERNED

02:04:33.999 --> 02:04:35.401
THAT ONE SEGMENT COULD HOLD BACK

02:04:35.467 --> 02:04:36.368
THE OTHER.

02:04:36.435 --> 02:04:37.636
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY AT

02:04:37.703 --> 02:04:39.438
THAT TIME ACTUALLY SPLIT SPLIT

02:04:39.505 --> 02:04:41.640
THAT ENTIRE USABLE SEGMENT UP

02:04:41.707 --> 02:04:43.142
INTO MERCED FRESNO FRESNO TO

02:04:43.209 --> 02:04:44.510
BAKERSFIELD.

02:04:44.577 --> 02:04:46.445
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS HAS

02:04:46.512 --> 02:04:49.014
THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT FOR OR

02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:51.417
COULD THERE BE ANY THOUGHT FOR

02:04:51.483 --> 02:04:54.086
TAKING THE MERCED TO SAN JOSE

02:04:54.153 --> 02:04:55.221
SEGMENT.

02:04:55.287 --> 02:04:58.457
AND LOOKING AT SMALLER BUILDING

02:04:58.524 --> 02:05:00.559
BLOCKS IF YOU WERE PERHAPS AT

02:05:00.626 --> 02:05:02.895
MERCED TO THE BASE OF THE

02:05:02.962 --> 02:05:04.029
TUNNELS.

02:05:04.096 --> 02:05:05.731
THE TUNNELS BEING A SECOND

02:05:05.798 --> 02:05:08.834
SEGMENT AND PERHAPS THE GILROY

02:05:08.901 --> 02:05:10.870
TO SAN JOSE SO THAT WE COULD

02:05:10.936 --> 02:05:13.739
LOOK AT WHAT WOULD BE THE COSTS.

02:05:13.806 --> 02:05:16.342
FOR EACH AND AS A BODY THE

02:05:16.408 --> 02:05:18.310
LEGISLATURE COULD DECIDE WHETHER

02:05:18.377 --> 02:05:22.114
WE WANT TO ADVANCE SOME MONIES

02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:23.616
FOR LAND ACQUISITION.

02:05:23.682 --> 02:05:25.551
AND ONE AREA OR ANOTHER AND AND

02:05:25.618 --> 02:05:27.319
HOW HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO

02:05:27.386 --> 02:05:28.520
THAT AND GET THEIR SIMILAR TO

02:05:28.587 --> 02:05:31.790
WHAT WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND NINE

02:05:31.857 --> 02:05:33.425
FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

02:05:33.492 --> 02:05:34.860
THE STRATEGY IS IS A GREAT

02:05:34.927 --> 02:05:37.162
STRATEGY AND THAT'S CALM OF THE

02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:38.597
APPROACH THAT WE HAVE AS WE CHE.

02:05:38.664 --> 02:05:40.199
AS WE COME INTO THE VALLEY THE

02:05:40.266 --> 02:05:41.300
VALLEY.

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:43.035
ALMOND LOOKING AT BASICALLY AND

02:05:43.102 --> 02:05:44.570
THEN THE BIG PIECE THE STUDY

02:05:44.637 --> 02:05:46.805
THERE IS IS THE PROJECT

02:05:46.872 --> 02:05:48.540
O'DONNELL'S UNDERSTANDING.

02:05:48.607 --> 02:05:50.743
UNDERSTANDING THAT TRUE COST US

02:05:50.809 --> 02:05:52.578
THE BIG DRIVER IN THAT SEGMENT --

02:05:52.645 --> 02:05:53.545
IN ADVANCING OF OUR

02:05:53.612 --> 02:05:55.347
ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS WE HOPE TO

02:05:55.414 --> 02:05:57.850
BE ABLE TO DO SOME THE GEO

02:05:57.917 --> 02:05:58.550
TECHNICAL WORK.

02:05:58.617 --> 02:06:00.319
SO THAT'LL GIVE US A GOOD IDEA

02:06:00.386 --> 02:06:02.821
OF WHAT THE COST IS AND ALSO TO

02:06:02.888 --> 02:06:04.990
WITH REGARDS TO MAKING IT A

02:06:05.057 --> 02:06:06.292
COMMERCIALLY VIABLE.

02:06:06.358 --> 02:06:08.694
THE MORE INFORMATION YOU NOW THE

02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:10.296
LESS RESCUE HALF SO IT MAKES IT

02:06:10.362 --> 02:06:12.364
MORE VIABLE TO HAVE THOSE P.

02:06:12.431 --> 02:06:13.666
THREE TYPE CONVERSATIONS

02:06:13.732 --> 02:06:13.966

PRESENTATION.

02:06:26.211 --> 02:06:29.581
WE LOOK AT PROJECTS SO THE

02:06:29.648 --> 02:06:30.849
PROJECT UNDER WAY.

02:06:30.916 --> 02:06:32.151

IT.

02:07:42.788 --> 02:07:44.289
YOU KNOW MOVE THE PROJECT SO WE

02:07:44.356 --> 02:07:45.290
DON'T HAVE THEM.

02:07:45.357 --> 02:07:47.426
DRAIN US.

02:07:47.493 --> 02:07:49.995
WORSE THAN THEY ALREADY ARE OKAY.

02:07:50.062 --> 02:07:51.897

STRATEGIC -- APPROACHES AS ONE

02:08:05.077 --> 02:08:06.211
EXAMPLE WOULD BE IS BRINGING IN

CANNOT BRING IT IN FROM THE EAST.

02:08:12.918 --> 02:08:14.353
SO WE PAID A LITTLE BIT

02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:17.289
DIVISIONAL AS AN TO BRING AN END

02:08:17.356 --> 02:08:18.791

IF I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THE MORE.

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:30.295
WHEN YOU START TO GET INTO THE

SAVINGS IS WE JUST ARTICULATED.

02:11:11.530 --> 02:11:13.532
THROUGH THROUGH THE ISSUES THAT

02:11:13.599 --> 02:11:15.067
WE HAD BASICALLY WITH

02:11:15.133 --> 02:11:16.635
PROCUREMENT OF RIGHT AWAY.

02:11:16.702 --> 02:11:19.004

PREDOMINATELY WITH THIRD PARTIES

02:11:23.008 --> 02:11:24.309
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE

02:11:24.376 --> 02:11:25.644
THE INTRUSION PRODUCTION BARRIER

02:11:25.711 --> 02:11:26.712
SYSTEMS.

02:11:26.778 --> 02:11:27.746
ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHANGE AND

02:11:27.813 --> 02:11:29.314
RAILROADS SINCE WE DID NOT HAVE

02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:32.784
A MASTER AGREEMENT IN PLACE AT

02:11:32.851 --> 02:11:34.119

AND THAT IS WHAT WE'VE WE'VE

02:11:45.197 --> 02:11:46.865
ARTICULATED BEFORE.

AT THOSE KASTRO RUNS A BIG PIECE

02:11:51.403 --> 02:11:54.806
OF THEM HAD BEEN TO SIGNIFICANT

02:11:54.873 --> 02:11:56.475

02:31:13.063 --> 02:31:15.232
BECOMES AVAILABLE.

02:31:15.299 --> 02:31:18.202
Q. KEY BOOK AND INVESTMENTS IN

02:31:18.269 --> 02:31:20.304
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE THE LINK

02:31:20.371 --> 02:31:21.939
UNION STATION PROJECT AND THE

02:31:22.006 --> 02:31:23.207
ROSECRANS MARQUARDT GREAT

02:31:23.274 --> 02:31:24.942
SEPARATION AND I'LL JUST GIVE

02:31:25.009 --> 02:31:26.911
YOU A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THESE

02:31:26.977 --> 02:31:29.180
TWO PROJECTS.

02:31:29.246 --> 02:31:31.816
LOS ANGELES UNION STATION IS THE

02:31:31.882 --> 02:31:34.785
LARGEST MULTIMODAL HUB IN

02:31:34.852 --> 02:31:36.187
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:31:36.253 --> 02:31:38.789
SERVING APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED

02:31:38.856 --> 02:31:40.591
THOUSAND PASSENGERS A DAY WITH

02:31:40.658 --> 02:31:44.028
OUR MATCHES SUBWAY LIGHT RAIL.

02:31:44.094 --> 02:31:46.564
AND OVER A HUNDRED OVER A

02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:48.032
THOUSAND BUSES METRO BUSES

02:31:48.098 --> 02:31:49.934
MUNICIPAL BUSES INCLUDING

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:53.437
INTERCITY AMTRAK BUSES.

02:31:53.504 --> 02:31:57.708
UNION STATION WITH BUILT IN.

02:31:57.775 --> 02:31:58.642
NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AS

02:31:58.709 --> 02:31:59.977
SEVENTY TRACKS AS YOU CAN SEE

02:32:00.044 --> 02:32:02.112
HERE IN THE PICTURE ALL TRAINS

02:32:02.179 --> 02:32:03.747
ENTER FROM THE NORTH OF THE

02:32:03.814 --> 02:32:05.416
NORTH IS WHERE THE THROAT AREA

02:32:05.483 --> 02:32:06.784
IS THE SOUTH IS WHERE YOU

02:32:06.851 --> 02:32:08.853
SEATING BOTTOM THAT THE US ONE

02:32:08.919 --> 02:32:11.188
AND ONE FREE WAY.

02:32:11.255 --> 02:32:14.492
TODAY EIGHTY YEARS LATER TWO

02:32:14.558 --> 02:32:17.561
THOUSAND NINETEEN FROM TWO FROM.

02:32:17.628 --> 02:32:18.095
NINETEEN THIRTY NINE IT IS

02:32:18.162 --> 02:32:19.129
LARGELY THE SAME.

02:32:19.196 --> 02:32:21.599
WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT WOULD BE

02:32:21.665 --> 02:32:24.101
BUILT ANOTHER SEVEN PLATFORMING

02:32:24.168 --> 02:32:26.370
UNION STATION SO YOU MAY THINK

02:32:26.437 --> 02:32:27.304
SIX BACK FROM HERE THERE'S

02:32:27.371 --> 02:32:28.739
ACTUALLY SEVEN PLATFORMS ALREADY

02:32:28.806 --> 02:32:29.773
THERE.

02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:31.609
SO THAT'S THE CHANGE AND EIGHTY

02:32:31.675 --> 02:32:34.778
YEARS.

02:32:34.845 --> 02:32:36.447
WELL AT LEAST UNION STATION

02:32:36.514 --> 02:32:39.116
PROJECT WILL TRANSFORM HOW ARE

02:32:39.183 --> 02:32:41.719
REGIONAL RAIL SYSTEM OPERATES IN

02:32:41.785 --> 02:32:43.354
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:46.757
BY PROVIDING RUN THROUGH TRACKS

02:32:46.824 --> 02:32:50.494
THAT WILL IN ABLE ONE SEAT RIDES

02:32:50.561 --> 02:32:51.862
FOR INNER CITY AMTRAK.

02:32:51.929 --> 02:32:53.998
TRAINS AS FAR NORTH AS SAN

02:32:54.064 --> 02:32:56.267
FRANCISCO AND AS FAR SOUTH AS

02:32:56.333 --> 02:32:57.601
SAN DIEGO.

02:32:57.668 --> 02:32:59.870
THIS IS A GAME CHANGER FOR A

02:32:59.937 --> 02:33:01.805
REGIONAL RAIL SYSTEM.

02:33:01.872 --> 02:33:04.008
IN ADDITION TO THAT IT WILL ALSO

02:33:04.074 --> 02:33:06.176
ACCOMMODATE A FUTURE HIGH SPEED

02:33:06.243 --> 02:33:06.944
RAIL.

02:33:07.011 --> 02:33:09.680
WITH UP TO WITH UP TO FOUR TWO

02:33:09.747 --> 02:33:12.249
PLATFORMS AND FOUR TRACKS.

02:33:12.316 --> 02:33:13.951
DELINKING IN STATION PROJECT HAS

02:33:14.018 --> 02:33:15.953
BROKEN OUT INTO TWO PHASES OF

02:33:16.020 --> 02:33:17.454
YOU SEE HERE IN THE CHART.

02:33:17.521 --> 02:33:19.123
YOU'LL HAVE THE RUN THROUGH

02:33:19.189 --> 02:33:21.592
TRACKS ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

02:33:21.659 --> 02:33:23.761
THAT WILL BE PART OF THE PHASE

02:33:23.827 --> 02:33:26.363
ONE THAT WILL ALSO INCLUDE EARLY

02:33:26.430 --> 02:33:27.765
TRACK AND SIGNAL WORK.

02:33:27.831 --> 02:33:29.934
AND THE FACE TIãU ARE WHAT WE

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:31.735
CALL PHASE BE WILL ALL WILL NOW

02:33:31.802 --> 02:33:33.704
INCLUDE THE FULL PLATFORM AND

02:33:33.771 --> 02:33:36.340
RAISING OF THE RAIL YARD OVER

02:33:36.407 --> 02:33:37.641
THE US ONE AND ONE FREEWAY.

02:33:37.708 --> 02:33:39.677
SO HERE IS THE FUNDING PLAN FOR

02:33:39.743 --> 02:33:40.911
THE FREE FOR THE LINK UNION

02:33:40.978 --> 02:33:43.347
STATION PROJECT PARTICULARLY THE

02:33:43.414 --> 02:33:45.082
FIRST PHASE WHICH WE CALL PHASE

02:33:45.149 --> 02:33:46.283
HEY.

02:33:46.350 --> 02:33:48.285
AS YOU CAN SEE THE BOOK AND

02:33:48.352 --> 02:33:49.920
PROJECT INVESTMENTS FROM THE

02:33:49.987 --> 02:33:52.089
HIGH SPEED RAIL IS ROUGHLY FOUR

02:33:52.156 --> 02:33:52.756
HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION

02:33:52.823 --> 02:33:54.725
DOLLARS WE ARE WORKING WITH THE

02:33:54.792 --> 02:33:56.126
HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO

02:33:56.193 --> 02:33:58.329
SECURE A FUNDING AGREEMENT FROM

02:33:58.395 --> 02:33:59.063
THEM.

02:33:59.129 --> 02:34:01.165
AS EARLY AS SUMMER OF THIS YEAR

02:34:01.231 --> 02:34:02.800
BUT NO HOPEFULLY NO LATER THAN

02:34:02.866 --> 02:34:06.203
FALL OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN

02:34:06.270 --> 02:34:07.838
ADDITION TO THAT.

02:34:07.905 --> 02:34:09.707
THE T. I. R. C. P. AS PART OF

02:34:09.773 --> 02:34:11.976
METROLINX OVERALL SCORE PROGRAM

02:34:12.042 --> 02:34:13.410
AWARDED THE LINKING AND STATION

02:34:13.477 --> 02:34:16.113
PROJECT APPROXIMATELY. THREE

02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:16.780
HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT MILLION

02:34:16.847 --> 02:34:19.717
DOLLARS AND THE REST OF THE

02:34:19.783 --> 02:34:21.885
REMAINING IS LOCAL FINDS.

02:34:21.952 --> 02:34:24.455
HERE IS WHAT WE'RE BUILDING IN A

02:34:24.521 --> 02:34:25.923
LINKING AND STATION AS PART OF

02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:27.658
PHASE ONE THE REAL CONSTANT

02:34:27.725 --> 02:34:31.528
SIGNALS DATES BACK.

02:34:31.595 --> 02:34:32.262
TO NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AND SO

02:34:32.329 --> 02:34:34.064
IT WE WILL TRANSFORM THAT BY

02:34:34.131 --> 02:34:35.766
COMPLETELY REVAMPING THE RAIL

02:34:35.833 --> 02:34:37.401
CONSTANCE SINGLES AT UNION

02:34:37.468 --> 02:34:39.403
STATION AND COMPLETING ACTION

02:34:39.470 --> 02:34:40.871
THE ACTUAL BUILD OUT OF THE

02:34:40.938 --> 02:34:43.407
ENTIRE RUN THRILLED TRACKS.

02:34:43.474 --> 02:34:44.942
THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE THAT WILL

02:34:45.009 --> 02:34:46.744
ALSO A COMEDY THE FUTURE HIGH

02:34:46.810 --> 02:34:47.978
SPEED RAIL.

02:34:48.045 --> 02:34:49.113
BUT IT'S PART OF AN INDEPENDENT

02:34:49.179 --> 02:34:51.181
UTILITY WE WILL START OUT WITH

02:34:51.248 --> 02:34:53.784
Q. OPERATING RUN THROUGH TRACKS

02:34:53.851 --> 02:34:55.819
AS PART OF PHASE A SO WE WILL

02:34:55.886 --> 02:34:58.288
TEMPORARILY BUILT A RUN THROUGH

02:34:58.355 --> 02:34:59.723
TRACK PLATFORM ON WHAT WE CALL

02:34:59.790 --> 02:35:02.459
PLATFORM FOR WHICH IS RIGHT IN

02:35:02.526 --> 02:35:04.294
THE MIDDLE OF THE RAIL YARD.

02:35:04.361 --> 02:35:06.030
WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE

02:35:06.096 --> 02:35:08.198
ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS WE HAVE

02:35:08.265 --> 02:35:09.600
MOVED FORWARD WITH SEPARATING

02:35:09.667 --> 02:35:10.901
THE KNEE BEND THE SEQUEL.

02:35:10.968 --> 02:35:12.736
THE SEQUEL IS ANTICIPATED TO BE

02:35:12.803 --> 02:35:14.471
COMPLETED BY JUNE OF THIS YEAR'S

02:35:14.538 --> 02:35:16.740
AND A COUPLE OF MONTHS WE'VE

02:35:16.807 --> 02:35:19.209
ALREADY COMPLETED -- WE'VE

02:35:19.276 --> 02:35:21.311
ALREADY RECEIVED THE COMMENTS TO

02:35:21.378 --> 02:35:23.447
THE DRAFT DIR AND WE HOPE TO

02:35:23.514 --> 02:35:26.216
FINALIZE THE SEQUEL PROCESS.

02:35:26.283 --> 02:35:28.752
BUDGET.

02:35:28.819 --> 02:35:30.554
NOW I'M GOING TO SWITCH OVER TO

02:35:30.621 --> 02:35:31.789
ONE OF THE GREAT SEPARATION THE

02:35:31.855 --> 02:35:33.691
FIRST BOOK AND PROJECT BY THE

02:35:33.757 --> 02:35:35.159
HIGH SPEED RAIL WHICH IS THE

02:35:35.225 --> 02:35:36.960
ROSECRANS MARQUARDT.

02:35:37.027 --> 02:35:38.595
IT WILL SCAN SMARTCARD IS

02:35:38.662 --> 02:35:40.230
LOCATED IN THE CITY OF SANTA FE

02:35:40.297 --> 02:35:41.098
SPRINGS.

02:35:41.165 --> 02:35:43.067
IT IS A DIAGONAL CROSSING SEE

02:35:43.133 --> 02:35:44.334
YOU CAN SEE HERE THE DIAGONAL

02:35:44.401 --> 02:35:46.437
CROSSING IT'S LOCATED IN ONE OF

02:35:46.503 --> 02:35:48.439
THE BUSIEST GOODS MOVEMENT

02:35:48.505 --> 02:35:50.307
CORRIDOR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:35:50.374 --> 02:35:52.443
IT IS OWNED BY BURLINGTON NORTH

02:35:52.509 --> 02:35:53.744
SANTA FE.

02:35:53.811 --> 02:35:56.914
AND OPERATED BY BNSF AS WELL.

02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:58.949
THIS BECAUSE OF THE DIAGONAL

02:35:59.016 --> 02:36:01.251
CROSSING IN BECAUSE OF A OVER A

02:36:01.318 --> 02:36:02.653
HUNDRED AND TWELVE FREIGHT AND

02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:04.655
PASSENGER TRAINS THAT PASSED BY

02:36:04.722 --> 02:36:05.889
EACH WEEKDAY.

02:36:05.956 --> 02:36:08.692
WITH OVER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:36:08.759 --> 02:36:10.494
VEHICLES IT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED

02:36:10.561 --> 02:36:11.929
AS ONE OF THE MOST HAZARDOUS

02:36:11.995 --> 02:36:15.432
CROSSING BY THE CP YOU SEE IN.

02:36:15.499 --> 02:36:15.933
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SO

02:36:15.999 --> 02:36:17.935
ESSENTIALLY TRAINS COME ACROSS

02:36:18.001 --> 02:36:20.938
THAT THIS GREAT CROSSING EVERY

02:36:21.004 --> 02:36:22.239
TEN MINUTES.

02:36:22.306 --> 02:36:24.208
AND FREIGHT TRAINS UNLIKE

02:36:24.274 --> 02:36:26.043
PASSENGER TRAINS IT SEEMS LIKE A

02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:28.879
LONG STRETCH I JUST KIND OF WANT

02:36:28.946 --> 02:36:30.347
TO POINT THAT OUT.

02:36:30.414 --> 02:36:32.049
HERE IS THE GRADE SEPARATION

02:36:32.116 --> 02:36:33.417
PROJECT OF THE PROPOSED

02:36:33.484 --> 02:36:36.620
CONDITION THIS ACCOMMODATES UP.

02:36:36.687 --> 02:36:37.788
TO FOUR ACCOMMODATES HIGH SPEED

02:36:37.855 --> 02:36:39.690
RAIL BY INCLUDING UP TO FOUR

02:36:39.757 --> 02:36:41.058
TRACKS AND JOURNEY FIFTH GRADE

02:36:41.125 --> 02:36:42.226
SEPARATION.

02:36:42.292 --> 02:36:44.128
RIGHT NOW BEING A STEP IS

02:36:44.194 --> 02:36:46.597
COMPLETING THE THIRD -- MAINLINE

02:36:46.663 --> 02:36:49.299
TRACK BY THE END OF THIS YEAR

02:36:49.366 --> 02:36:51.602
WHICH WILL ALLOW ADDITIONAL TIME

02:36:51.668 --> 02:36:54.271
SPOTS BECAUSE THIS IS OPERATED

02:36:54.338 --> 02:36:55.806
AND MAINTAINED BY BEING A STAFF.

02:36:55.873 --> 02:36:57.274
PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE IS

02:36:57.341 --> 02:36:59.643
THOUGHT IS PROVIDED TIME SLOTS

02:36:59.710 --> 02:37:00.978
ALONG THE CORRIDOR.

02:37:01.044 --> 02:37:03.080
THE WITH THE THIRD MAILING TRACK

02:37:03.147 --> 02:37:04.481
AND WITH THE GROCERY AS

02:37:04.548 --> 02:37:06.049
MARQUARDT GRADE SEPARATION IT

02:37:06.116 --> 02:37:07.684
REALLY PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TIME

02:37:07.751 --> 02:37:09.953
SLOTS FOR METROLINK AN AMTRAK

02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:11.722
TRAINS.

02:37:11.789 --> 02:37:13.323
SO HERE'S THE FUNDING PLAN AS

02:37:13.390 --> 02:37:14.792
YOU CAN SEE.

02:37:14.858 --> 02:37:17.995
HIGH SPEED RAIL IS PROVIDING 50%

02:37:18.061 --> 02:37:19.163
OF THE INVESTMENT IN THE

02:37:19.229 --> 02:37:20.664
ROSECRANS MARQUARDT WE'VE

02:37:20.731 --> 02:37:23.100
ALREADY RECEIVED THE BENEFITS OF

02:37:23.167 --> 02:37:25.602
THIS WE'RE IN IN THE PROCESS OF

02:37:25.669 --> 02:37:27.137
REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION.

02:37:27.204 --> 02:37:29.072
WE WE HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED AT

02:37:29.139 --> 02:37:31.375
LEAST TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO

02:37:31.441 --> 02:37:33.076
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR THEIR

02:37:33.143 --> 02:37:35.379
INVESTMENTS IN THE RESIDENTS

02:37:35.445 --> 02:37:37.080
MARQUARDT GRAY SEPARATION.

02:37:37.147 --> 02:37:39.850
WE HOPE TO SICK COMPLETES THE

02:37:39.917 --> 02:37:43.020
CONSTRUCTION AND UP BY TWENTY

02:37:43.086 --> 02:37:43.620
TWENTY THREE AND HOPE TO WARD

02:37:43.687 --> 02:37:49.092
CONSTRUCTION BY.

02:37:49.159 --> 02:37:49.726
TWENTY TWENTY THE NOW I'M JUST

02:37:49.793 --> 02:37:51.829
GOING TO PLAY A VIDEO OF THE

02:37:51.895 --> 02:37:53.730
LINK UNION STATION PROJECT I DO

02:37:53.797 --> 02:37:56.033
YOU WANT TO ADD A QUALIFIER THAT

02:37:56.099 --> 02:37:57.234
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A VIDEO

02:37:57.301 --> 02:37:59.703
THAT THE ROLLS ROYCE OF WHITE.

02:37:59.770 --> 02:38:01.471
LOS ANGELES UNION STATION COULD

02:38:01.538 --> 02:38:02.506
BE.

02:38:02.573 --> 02:38:03.874
AND SO SOME OF THESE ARE NOT

02:38:03.941 --> 02:38:05.442
BLINDED AND IT'S MORE OF A

02:38:05.509 --> 02:38:07.578
VISION OF WHAT WE CAN IMAGINE IT

02:38:07.644 --> 02:38:08.245
TO BE.

02:38:08.312 --> 02:38:10.047
I AM I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE

02:38:10.113 --> 02:38:11.582
FAMILIAR WITH THEIR NOKIA STATE

02:38:11.648 --> 02:38:13.283
THEATER DOWN IN DOWNTOWN WITH

02:38:13.350 --> 02:38:16.854
THE STABLE CENTRE NIKITA THEATER.

TOP PERFORMING LINE.

02:47:18.862 --> 02:47:21.498
PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM

BURBANK TO LOS ANGELES UNION

02:48:03.106 --> 02:48:04.707
STATION BUT FURTHER NORTH LIKE

02:48:04.774 --> 02:48:06.242
FROM PALMDALE WHERE HIGH SPEED

02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:08.111
RAIL DOESN'T TEND TO HAVE.

02:48:08.178 --> 02:48:09.813
IT CONNECTIVITY HUB UP IN THE

REQUIRES ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS

02:48:16.052 --> 02:48:18.621
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE WITH OR

02:48:18.688 --> 02:48:20.089
ASKING TO LOOK INTO.

02:48:20.156 --> 02:48:22.225
ENHANCE INVESTMENTS IN THE RAIL

CORRIDOR ALL THE WAY FROM PALM

02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:27.297
DEL DOWN TO BURBANK -- I EIGHT

02:48:27.363 --> 02:48:29.332
DEPENDING ON HOW HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:48:29.399 --> 02:48:31.468
AND WHERE THEY WANT TO CALM AS

02:48:31.534 --> 02:48:34.971
AN OPTION THAT WE ARE OPEN --

02:48:35.038 --> 02:48:36.706

OPEN THAT YOU CAN LOOK INTO

02:48:38.107 --> 02:48:39.642
DOUBLE TRACKING THAT RAIL

02:48:39.709 --> 02:48:41.945
CORRIDOR THAT CAN BE USED MAYBE

02:48:42.011 --> 02:48:44.781
AS AN INTERIM OPERATING SEGMENT

02:48:44.848 --> 02:48:46.216
FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL WHILE THE

02:48:46.282 --> 02:48:48.384
BILL TO MORE DEDICATED. HUNDRED

02:48:48.451 --> 02:48:52.055

IT HAS BEEN STUDIED WE HAVE A A

02:48:58.394 --> 02:48:59.295
DOUBLE TRACKING PROJECT ROUGHLY

02:48:59.362 --> 02:49:01.331

STRETCH.

02:49:08.671 --> 02:49:09.873
AND THEN WE WOULD NEED FURTHER

02:49:09.939 --> 02:49:11.241
DOUBLE TRACKING FROM THAT

02:49:11.307 --> 02:49:12.876
SEGMENT ALL THE WAY UP TO

02:49:12.942 --> 02:49:18.181
PALMDALE TO MAKE IT A FULL LEAD --

02:49:18.248 --> 02:49:19.916
OF FOR HOPEFULLY DOUBLE TRACKED

02:49:19.983 --> 02:49:21.551
CORRIDOR [inaudible]

CALTRAIN.

02:49:23.253 --> 02:49:24.821
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I I GUESS

02:49:24.888 --> 02:49:26.422
TO THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT

02:49:26.489 --> 02:49:28.558
AREAS IN THE CALTRAIN SYSTEM

02:49:28.625 --> 02:49:30.527
WHERE I THINK -- FOR HIGH SPEED

02:49:30.593 --> 02:49:31.861
RAIL PURPOSES ADDITIONAL

02:49:31.928 --> 02:49:33.429
INVESTMENT WOULD BE NEEDED WHICH

02:49:33.496 --> 02:49:35.999
WOULD BE -- SUPPLEMENTAL TO OUR

02:49:36.065 --> 02:49:36.933
SERVICES.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:38.234
FIRST I'D LIKE TO PUT IT IN

02:49:38.301 --> 02:49:40.236
CONTEXT AS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN

02:49:40.303 --> 02:49:42.205
THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE'S A

02:49:42.272 --> 02:49:43.373
HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES.

02:49:43.439 --> 02:49:45.375
OF RIGHT AWAY IN A CIVIL WORK

02:49:45.441 --> 02:49:48.845
BEING DONE -- IN OUR SAN

02:49:48.912 --> 02:49:50.847
FRANCISCO TO SAN IS A SYSTEM

02:49:50.914 --> 02:49:52.916
THAT WE OWN THE RIGHT AWAY

02:49:52.982 --> 02:49:54.551
OTHERS FIFTY TWO MILES.

02:49:54.617 --> 02:49:58.621
AND SO AS PART OF THE CALTRAIN

02:49:58.688 --> 02:50:00.890
ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT M. THE

02:50:00.957 --> 02:50:02.892
INVESTMENT THAT THE STATE IS

02:50:02.959 --> 02:50:05.862
MAKING THROUGH HIGH SPEED RAIL --

02:50:05.929 --> 02:50:10.500
AS A GRAND TOUR IN A AND TO US --

02:50:10.567 --> 02:50:12.435
AMONG OTHER FUNDING AGENCIES --

02:50:12.502 --> 02:50:14.137
HIGH SPEED RAIL IS IS RECEIVING

02:50:14.203 --> 02:50:16.606
A PROPERTY INTEREST IN.

02:50:16.673 --> 02:50:18.374
OUR RIGHT AWAY SO THAT IT WILL

02:50:18.441 --> 02:50:21.711
HAVE A PROPERTY RIGHT TO

02:50:21.778 --> 02:50:21.978
ACTUALLY.

02:50:22.045 --> 02:50:23.146
OPERATE.

02:50:23.212 --> 02:50:25.481
IT IS STILL AS I MENTIONED TO A

02:50:25.548 --> 02:50:28.818
SEPARATE PRODUCT A PROJECT THAT

02:50:28.885 --> 02:50:31.187
AS THE COURT SAID -- YET

02:50:31.254 --> 02:50:32.388
INTERESTINGLY WAS A VERY

02:50:32.455 --> 02:50:34.157
INTERESTING BUSINESS AND FACTUAL

02:50:34.223 --> 02:50:35.558
STATEMENT THE COURT SAID IT IS

02:50:35.625 --> 02:50:36.993
QUITE CLEAR THAT A HIGH SPEED

02:50:37.060 --> 02:50:38.561
RAIL TRAIN CANNOT SIMPLY BE

02:50:38.628 --> 02:50:39.596
PLACED.

02:50:39.662 --> 02:50:44.767
ON ELECTRIFYING CALTRAIN TRACK.

02:50:44.834 --> 02:50:45.234
MANY OTHER CHANGES AND

02:50:45.301 --> 02:50:46.569
IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE REQUIRED.

02:50:46.636 --> 02:50:47.604
TO IMPLEMENT THE BLENDED SYSTEM

02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:48.838
IT BRING HIGH SPEED RAIL TO THE

02:50:48.905 --> 02:50:51.541
PENINSULA -- SHOWED IS A

02:50:51.608 --> 02:50:53.009
SEPARATE PROJECT BUT WE HAVE THE

02:50:53.076 --> 02:50:55.678
FOUNDATION BOB BY THE INVESTMENT

02:50:55.745 --> 02:50:57.313
IS BEING MADE AND

02:50:57.380 --> 02:50:59.048
ELECTRIFICATION.

02:50:59.115 --> 02:51:00.984
AND ON LIKE TO CENTRAL VALLEY

02:51:01.050 --> 02:51:02.118
WE'RE NOT A CONTRACTOR

02:51:02.185 --> 02:51:03.620
PERFORMING WORK ON BEHALF OF

02:51:03.686 --> 02:51:04.754
HIGH SPEED RAIL THIS IS A

02:51:04.821 --> 02:51:06.990
PROJECT THIS GOT MULTIPLE

02:51:07.056 --> 02:51:07.357
FUNDERS.

02:51:07.423 --> 02:51:09.826
AND TOTAL COSTS FOR WHAT.

02:51:09.892 --> 02:51:11.828
WE AND OUR TWO BILLION DOLLAR

02:51:11.894 --> 02:51:13.563
PROJECT -- APPROXIMATELY FOR

02:51:13.630 --> 02:51:16.032
ELECTRIFICATION BUT THE THREE

02:51:16.099 --> 02:51:17.934
AREAS I THINK THAT ARE OF MUTUAL

02:51:18.001 --> 02:51:19.569
INTEREST TO US IN HIGH SPEED

02:51:19.636 --> 02:51:21.604
RAIL ONE IS THAT SAN JOSE TO

02:51:21.671 --> 02:51:24.741
GILROY -- THE ELECTRIFICATION

02:51:24.807 --> 02:51:27.143
PROJECT DOES NOT EXTEND PAST SAN

02:51:27.210 --> 02:51:29.379
JOSE TO GILROY -- BUT IT WOULD

02:51:29.445 --> 02:51:31.648
BE IN THE MUTUAL INTEREST OF OF

02:51:31.714 --> 02:51:34.317
HIGH SPEED RAIL AND AND CALTRAIN

02:51:34.384 --> 02:51:36.052
FOREVER THE ELECTRIFICATION TO

02:51:36.119 --> 02:51:39.255
CURB WE RUN DIESEL SERVICE THERE.

02:51:39.322 --> 02:51:42.158
ON UNION PACIFIC TRACKS -- AND

02:51:42.225 --> 02:51:44.961
WE DO NOT OWN THAT RIGHT AWAY WE

02:51:45.028 --> 02:51:47.230
ARE -- THERE'S A TRACKAGE RIGHTS

02:51:47.296 --> 02:51:48.498
AGREEMENTS WITH THE SERVICES

02:51:48.564 --> 02:51:50.733
LIMITED IT IS NOT ELECTRIFIED

02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:51.634
SERVICE.

02:51:51.701 --> 02:51:53.202
AND WE KNOW FROM THE FROM THE

02:51:53.269 --> 02:51:55.238
LAST BUSINESSPLAN OF OF HIGH

02:51:55.304 --> 02:51:57.440
SPEED REALTORS AN EMPHASIS ON

02:51:57.507 --> 02:51:59.442
SAN JOSE. TO TO GO RIGHT

02:51:59.509 --> 02:52:01.177
COMPLETED THAT THE HIGH SPEED

02:52:01.244 --> 02:52:03.312
RAIL STATION A PROPOSED THAT GO

02:52:03.379 --> 02:52:05.715
RIGHT OR CORRECT YES -- SO

02:52:05.782 --> 02:52:08.084
THAT'S ONE AREA WERE -- RIGHT HI

02:52:08.151 --> 02:52:09.919
WELL IT'S WE CAN WE CAN SERVE

02:52:09.986 --> 02:52:11.621
THAT WITHOUT ELECTRIFICATION

02:52:11.688 --> 02:52:13.222
WITHOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL I THINK

02:52:13.289 --> 02:52:15.358
THAT'S ONE OF A MUTUAL INTEREST.

02:52:15.425 --> 02:52:17.760
THE SECOND IS WITH RESPECT TO

02:52:17.827 --> 02:52:18.961
WHAT MAY HAPPEN AT THE SAME AS A

02:52:19.028 --> 02:52:21.564
DIRT ON STATION THAT YOU'RE VERY.

02:52:21.631 --> 02:52:26.302
FAMILIAR WITH -- BY THE WITH THE

02:52:26.369 --> 02:52:28.938
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL COMING INTO

02:52:29.005 --> 02:52:31.441
SAN IS A WITH PART COMING INTO --

02:52:31.507 --> 02:52:33.810

02:52:39.782 --> 02:52:41.451
DEVELOPMENT THAT'S OCCURRING IN

02:52:41.517 --> 02:52:44.220
AROUND -- THAT STATION THERE

02:52:44.287 --> 02:52:46.422
WILL BE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT

02:52:46.489 --> 02:52:50.426
WILL BE REQUIRED -- END OF WE

02:52:50.493 --> 02:52:51.661
KNOW THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:52:51.728 --> 02:52:53.196
FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES SEPARATE

02:52:53.262 --> 02:52:55.431
APART FROM OF ALL THE OTHERS IT

02:52:55.498 --> 02:52:56.632
WILL THERE WILL HAVE TO BE AN

02:52:56.699 --> 02:53:01.971
INVESTMENT MADE.

02:53:02.038 --> 02:53:04.073
IN THAT STATE XIN.

02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:05.141
AND THERE'S A PLANNING PROCESS

02:53:05.208 --> 02:53:06.275
IN PLACE THAT INCLUDES MULTIPLE

02:53:06.342 --> 02:53:06.776
PARTIES.

02:53:06.843 --> 02:53:07.910

SAN JOSE. TO WORK ON ON PLANNING

02:53:15.918 --> 02:53:17.653
FOR THAT STATION AREAS SO THAT'S

02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:20.123
AN AREA IN WHICH I I I'M NOT

02:53:20.189 --> 02:53:21.491
SURE WHETHER OR NOT HIGH SPEED

02:53:21.557 --> 02:53:23.259
RAW ACTUALLY WILL HAVE TO FIGHT

02:53:23.326 --> 02:53:25.528
THE FUNDS IT'S THE HIGH SPEED

02:53:25.595 --> 02:53:26.629
RAIL FOLKS WILL KNOW THAT THAT

02:53:26.696 --> 02:53:27.997
THERE WILL BE SOME.

02:53:28.064 --> 02:53:29.031
FUNDING REQUIREMENT AND THAT

02:53:29.098 --> 02:53:31.434
WILL BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL.

02:53:31.501 --> 02:53:33.202
FOR THE CITY OF SAN JOSE AND AND

FRANCISCO BY THE DOWNTOWN

02:53:38.841 --> 02:53:41.644
TERMINAL -- IN THE EXT EXTENSION

02:53:41.711 --> 02:53:44.247
FROM -- FOR THINKING STATION IN

02:53:44.313 --> 02:53:45.782
SAN FRANCISCO TO THE DOWNTOWN

02:53:45.848 --> 02:53:47.717
TERMINAL THAT'S OF INTEREST TO

02:53:47.784 --> 02:53:49.852
CALTRAIN TO HIGH SPEED RAIL.

02:53:49.919 --> 02:53:52.088
AND THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO --

02:53:52.155 --> 02:53:55.792
AND SO -- YOU THAT THAT'S A VERY

02:53:55.858 --> 02:53:57.894
EXPENSIVE PROJECT -- THERE'S A

02:53:57.960 --> 02:53:59.162
PLANNING GOING ON IN THERE OR

02:53:59.228 --> 02:54:01.831
YOU JUST NEED TO BUILD EXTENSION.

02:54:01.898 --> 02:54:04.133
BY ALL RIGHT KIND OF THEIR YEAH

02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:05.268
IT SHOULD YEAH THIS KIND OF

02:54:05.334 --> 02:54:05.568
THEIR OWN.

02:54:05.635 --> 02:54:07.937
WE HAD A A STEEL BEAM THAT IDEA

02:54:08.004 --> 02:54:09.338
AND THEY JUST NEED TO BUILD THE

02:54:09.405 --> 02:54:11.307
THE EXTENSION IS IS A LITTLE OF

02:54:11.374 --> 02:54:14.477
AN UNDERSTATEMENT -- BUT IT

02:54:14.544 --> 02:54:16.312
WOULD BE A VERY COMPLEX -- BUT

02:54:16.379 --> 02:54:18.981
INTERESTING PROJECT IT'S IT'S

02:54:19.048 --> 02:54:20.616
OUR MUTUAL INTEREST AGAIN

02:54:20.683 --> 02:54:22.418
CALTRAIN -- DOESN'T HAVE TO

02:54:22.485 --> 02:54:24.720
EXTEND FROM FOR THINKING TO THE

02:54:24.787 --> 02:54:27.890
DOWNTOWN TERMINAL WE WE HAVE --

02:54:27.957 --> 02:54:29.158
YOU KNOW LOTS OF TRAIN SERVICE

BUT IT WOULD BE IN OUR INTEREST

02:54:31.961 --> 02:54:37.900
AS WELL FOR THEIR AN EXTENSION

02:54:37.967 --> 02:54:39.035
TO BE MADE.

02:54:39.101 --> 02:54:39.769
SO THOSE ARE THE THREE SPECIFIC

02:54:39.836 --> 02:54:41.070
AREAS THAT COME TO MIND IN

02:54:41.137 --> 02:54:42.038
RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION.

02:54:42.104 --> 02:54:43.306

GET INTO THE NEXT.

02:54:45.241 --> 02:54:50.546
PHASE OF THE TRANSIT FUNDING --

02:54:50.613 --> 02:54:52.281
THEY'RE ALL THESE PROJECTS WOULD

02:54:52.348 --> 02:54:54.217
ENHANCE THE ALL TWO MILLION

OF BOTH YOUR SYSTEMS AND THE

02:54:58.654 --> 02:55:00.022
HIGH SPEED RAIL BOTH.

02:55:00.089 --> 02:55:01.858
YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE AB SO BOTH

02:55:01.924 --> 02:55:04.360
WOULD BENEFIT.

02:55:04.427 --> 02:55:07.830
IN TERMS OF RIDERSHIP OF TAKING

02:55:07.897 --> 02:55:09.932

03:01:47.630 --> 03:01:49.031
SEPARATIONS BUT I JUST WANT TO

03:01:49.098 --> 03:01:50.699
REMIND MEMBERS THAT THE WAY THAT

03:01:50.766 --> 03:01:52.835
PROP ONE IT WAS WRITTEN IS THAT.

03:01:52.901 --> 03:01:54.169
ANY MONEY THAT WE SPEND

03:01:54.236 --> 03:01:55.304
ESSENTIALLY HAS TO BE A

03:01:55.371 --> 03:01:58.007
COMMITMENT TO DO THAT CORD OR AS

03:01:58.073 --> 03:01:59.875
A USABLE CORD OR BECAUSE THE

03:01:59.942 --> 03:02:01.443
INTENTION WAS SO THAT WE

03:02:01.510 --> 03:02:04.713
WOULDN'T -- END UP USING THE

03:02:04.780 --> 03:02:06.282
HIGH SPEED RAIL MONEY FOR THIS

03:02:06.348 --> 03:02:07.883
PURPOSE ALL OVER THE STATE BUT

03:02:07.950 --> 03:02:08.951
RATHER.

AT EACH END.

03:02:20.262 --> 03:02:21.830
SO WE COULD USE IT FOR THAT

03:02:21.897 --> 03:02:26.135
PURPOSE AND THEN THERE WAS --

03:02:26.201 --> 03:02:28.270
GREATER WEIGHT WOULD BE GIVEN TO

03:02:28.337 --> 03:02:30.339
USABLE CORRIDORS THAT WOULD

03:02:30.406 --> 03:02:32.508
