TWENTY THIRD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TALK ABOUT SB NINETY SEVEN. ARE YOU THERE ON THE PHONE JUST DOUBLE CHECK. THANK YOU MISTER CHANG AND MISTER OBERNOLTE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT THEY COULD SPEND OFTEN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ONE ADMINISTRATIVE NOTES BEFORE WE START THAT THOSE OF US NOT FROM FINANCE ON THE PHONE- WE CAN'T REALLY HEAR- THAT STATEMENT AND COMMENTS ON THE FLOOR I KNOW THERE'S SOME. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES I ALSO HAVE THE TV ON IN MY OFFICE I'M GONNA TRY TO PIECE TOGETHER WHAT I CAN FROM THERE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ANY QUESTIONS- EITHER SOMEONE COULD REPEAT THEM ON THE PHONE LINE OR I CAN KEEP THEM TOGETHER FROM THE TV. I'M HAPPY TO REPEAT AND EXPAND THAT- OTHER FOLKS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR ON THE LINE- CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION- BUT WITH THAT I WILL START WITH. THE NINETY SEVEN THIS IS A BILL IT'S PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND I KNOW THAT- WE GO TO THE MINISTRATION AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE WORKING TOWARD FINALIZING OVERALL OPPOSITION NINETY PACKAGE- BUT THEY'RE JUST ITEMS OF NOTE IN THIS PARTICULAR PAL. FIRST ALL ROLLED UP SOME SPEND FROM THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR OF TWENTY DASH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT INCLUDES. TWENTY FIVE. I SPENDING FOR JUNE AT THE YEAR TO JULY AS WELL AS THE HUNDRED THIRTY KNOWING DOLLAR INTO CALL AND FROM JUNE SUCH A AND THEN THE ITEM IN THIS BILL IS GOING TO PROP LIKE FOUR HUNDRED NO DOLLAR AND THIS IS A SAD PAYMENT MEANING UNDER THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT CARE HE FOR OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE INCURRED IN PRIOR YEARS SO THESE ARE THE TWO MAIN ELEMENTS THAT. THEY'LL AND HAPPY THERE. GREAT THANK YOU WE'RE WE'RE GONNA GO TO L. L. MISTER PATRICK ARE YOU THERE. GET HEADACHE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE- AND PONDERED ON THE LINE TO DISCUSS THIS ONE. I THINK. SECRETARY MEMBERS CAN UPON WHAT THE LEDGE ANALYST'S OFFICE- I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID BUT WE'D BE HPPY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THIS ONE. OKAY MISTER ABROAD HAVE QUESTIONS. THE BIGGEST AT. WE HAVE A MIKE ON FOR MISTER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN QUESTIONS FOR- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MR THIS ONE OFTEN. ARE I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT THIS IS A WORTHWHILE THING TO BE DOING- BACK FILLING THE REVENUE THAT- THIS THE SCHOOLS ARE DEPENDING ON IN THE CURRENT BUDGETARY YEAR THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE WEEKS LEFT IN THAT YEAR OF COURSE AND SO IT WOULD BECAUSE REALLY DIRE FINANCIAL TROUBLE FOR. EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE STATE IF WE WERE TO FAIL TO DO THAT HOWEVER I'M ALSO PROBABLY NOT ALONE IN HAVING SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE FACT THEY WERE USING A DEFERRAL IS THE MECHANIST FOR ACCOMPLISHING BACKFILL AND WONDERING IF YOU COULD DESCRIBE THE PROCESS THE THOUGHT PROCESS THAT WAS USED. TO SETTLE ON A DEFERRAL IS THE APPROPRIATE MECHANIC AND WHAT OTHER- WHAT OTHER MECHANISMS WERE CONSIDERED. YES OBERNOLTE ALL THIS QUESTION AT THAT THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND THE DEFERRAL AND AS WELL AS OTHER MECHANISMS I'LL DESCRIBE REACH. AND THEN MY COLLEAGUES. THAT THE HOME. MAY WANT TO ADD AS WELL. I THINK THE FIRST IS THAT- THESE DEFERRALS WHILE CERTAINLY NOT IDEAL- YOU RELY ON LOCAL SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS BORROWING. CAPACITY AND THEY HAVE BEEN USED IN THE PAST DURING TOUGH TIMES AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT. WE ARE IN A TOUGH TIME NOW SO WE NEED TO BELIEVE THAT. A SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO MAKE. IT EASIER FOR ALL AND THAT CONTINUE. IN THE TIGHT BUDGET TIME THAT WE ARE AND- TO TRY TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS- BUT I DEFINITELY DO WANT TO KNOW THAT WHILE THE DEFERRALS ARE ONE PART OF THE WAY IN WHICH YOU COULD BUDGET. FIELD YAK. GRABBING YOU. THAT WE SAW. IN MAY REVISION COMPARED JANUARY. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY ONE AND I THINK TWO OTHER ITEMS. OF NOTE OUR NUMBER ONE DAY CORONAVIRUS WHERE WE FIND- WHICH ARE DELIVERED NINE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS YEAH THE STATE- WHICH I KNOW. SINCE RIGHT NOW THE STATE SIMPLEX AND OR HAVE SIMPLY. IN TERMS HOW TO SPEND THAT ON A VARIETY OF KOBE NINE RISK. ACTIVITIES AND THE ADMINISTRATOR PROPOSAL WHICH I KNOW A LOT OF MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW. SUPPORTED AGENTS. HI ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO FINAL AGREEMENT JUST YET IT'S TO DEVOTE ALMOST HALF OF THAT SPECIFICALLY AT SOME THESE MORNING LOS INTEGRITY ISSUES OF THAT WOULD BE. ON TOP- THE POSITION NINETY EIGHT NINE AND THAT WOULD NOT BE A CURE FOR ALL OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM LIKE THAT BUT IT WOULD BE. ACTUAL FUNDING FROM. GOVERNMENT AND THEN THE SECOND% PART- THAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE NAY RELATION- WHICH WE THINK WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL PACKAGE. IS PROVIDING A SUPPLEMENTAL OBLIGATION TO SCHOOL- ABOUT CRACKS IN THE LATE YOU KNOW ONE AND A HALF BILLION- BILLION DOLLARS. IN EACH OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS SO WITH. THAT THE STAFF WILL ALSO HELP RESTORE THE PROPOSITION. WHILE THE TO WORLD DOES HELP US GET THROUGH THE- TIMES IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY NOT. THAT WERE USING A WE THINK HOW TO MAKE AND BACK. IN OUR SCHOOLS I'M SO THAT A BRIEF ANSWER CHAPTER IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WANT TO. FINANCE AND IN. NOTHING I FOR JOB OKAY AND GETTING AN OPEN HERE. AND EVERYTHING AT MY PREGNANT YOU. AND PUT. BELL I THAT IN NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR COULD ARE BACK TO THE GAME THE IMPACT OF THE PHONE MUCH. RIGHT I'M GONNA OPEN THE PROP. THEY RAINY SIGN THEY ALSO THANK YOU FOR. THAT THE FOUR HUNDRED SIX MILLION IF ANYTHING ANYTHING IN THE- FROM YEAR YOU CAN. FIND ON NINETEEN TWENTY. THREE THAT DID NOT HAVE CUT. MAKE TWENTY. AND THAT BECAUSE THEY GET. KIND OF THE POSSIBLY COULD HAVE BEEN A THAT. ON AND MR MCNAUGHTON AND I'M NOT A- PUSH. WE'LL GO BACK TO MR RESPOND AT THE. SECOND ED AT THE ONE ONE FOUR AND THIS IS THE- KEY REVENUE MEASURE THAT IS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE- AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ITEMS IN THE STEALTH BUT I WILL FOCUS VERY BRIEFLY ON THE HIGHLIGHTS IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE Q. REVENUE MEASURE THAT WE EXPECT COMBINED JERRY RAISED FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN THAT NEXT YEAR AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FUNDS OVER THE PHONE TWO YEARS. THE FIRST IS THE- SUSPENSION OF THE USE OF NET OPERATING LOSSES- FOR TAXPAYERS THAT HAD INCOME OF OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS SO THIS WOULD BE UNTIL THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY Q. AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS A CAP ON THE USE- BUSINESS INCENTIVE CREDIT. AT THE LEVEL OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ALSO FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE. WHAT OTHER WHAT. THAT MAY HAVE CONCERNS OF THAT WE VERY MUCH ONE TO SPREAD THAT THIS IS FOR A TEMPORARY PERIOD IT'S THREE YEARS WE CAPS MAKE SURE IT'S ONLY FOR ENTITIES HAD INCOME A ONE DOLLARS FOR THE AND I. AND THE BUSINESS AND SO CRIED ALL TECHNICIANS THAT ARE ADVANTAGE OF ANYTHING LEFT FIVE MILLION AND CAN CONTINUE TO DO SO THEIR FULL AMOUNT I THEN THE MADE THAT I WANT STRESS THAT WHILE YOU SHOULD BE CREDIT. GET UP LOSSES MAY GO LET I WILL BE ABLE TO BE USED AGAINST STARTING IN TWO THREE I ANY FOR NET HOPPER LOSS WHAT OTHER WHY BY EVEN IF THE WORD YOU SPECIFICALLY THE ONE TO PROBATION ON THE- WILL BE. TWENTY TWO THAT THEY CAN BE USED SO THOSE ARE THE TWO MAIN EITHER AND NOW THERE ARE ALSO COME OTHER OTHER ITEM ONE A THEY KERREY PERIOD FOR THAT EXISTING FILLED CREDIT AND THEN THERE IS. A NEW PROVISION ON THAT USED DEALERS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE WE LEADING THE SALES TAX THAT IS OWED ON THE TRANSACTION THAT THEY'RE UNDERTAKING THAT EVERYONE CAN INDUSTRY IS ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD- AND THEN THE FINAL FEW MEASURES OF NOTE I WILL MENTION BUT GET BACK TO THAT YEAH. BUDGET IS AN EXTENSION ON THE- EXEMPTION ON THAT SALES AND USE TAX FOR AT AND MENTAL PRODUCTS AND THE SECOND EIGHT AT MINIMUM FRANK I COULD SENSE FOR FIRST YEAR PARKER'S. ANYONE. THE LIGHT. I AM BACK OUT BE THE SPELL GO ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO THOSE ARE MAIN I ALL HAVE TO CAME ALL THE LINE DEPART OF FINANCING WE ARE READY UNIT AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY. AFTER THE LA. THE THING YOU L. L. ANY A- COMMENTS. AS CHAIR THIS IS GABE HEADACHE AT THIS TIME I'M HERE WITH MY- COLLEAGUE BRAIN YOU ARE FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS BUT IT THIS TIME WE DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS ON. GOING TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS MISTRAL NOT. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND A QUESTION ABOUT THE LIMITATION IN THIS BILL OF A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CAP ON TAX CREDITS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS IS A- PROPOSED BE RETROACTIVE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. SO MY QUESTION IS- IN IN A SITUATION WHERE FOR EXAMPLE A FILM STUDIO WAS IN RELIANCE ON THE MOTION PICTURE OF PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT HAD ARRANGED FOR SOME FILMING TO BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR. ARE WE SAID WE ARE ATTRACTIVELY DISALLOW BUYING THE USE OF THAT TAX CREDIT STAND THAT REPORT. OKAY SO. IF YOU WANT A COMPANY'S CREDIT YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THE GATE BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT YEAR- I WILL SAY THAT GENERALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THESE TYPES THAT. TAX MEASURES AND AT THE CONFORMITY NECESSARY THAT WE ALL DISCUSSED AND WORKED ON A YEAR AGO WAS INNOCENT MORE BOKEH GENERALLY WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THE SACK. THANK YOU OFTEN GO RECTOR ACT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND I THINK IN THIS YEAR. IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THAT YOU KNOW KOBE IT APPEARED ON THE SCENE IN JANUARY AN- IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO HAVE AN IMPACT AND THEN BY MARCH IS WHEN WE SAW THAT STAY AT HOME ORDER SO WE BELIEVE. IT IS APPROPRIATE I THINK. WHEN THANK YOU THE SIDE THAT SOMEONE IN THE EXTENT THAT YOU JUST GOT WERE ON A TO YOU THAT CREDIT RIGHT NOW IT MAY NOT BE IDEAL THEY MAY WANT USE IT NOW UNDERSTAND BUT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THAT IN A FUTURE YEAR UNDER OUR- OKAY SO- I FIND THAT VERY DISAPPOINTING. YOU KNOW THESE COMPANIES THAT MADE GOOD FAITH DECISIONS BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OF STATE LAW WHEN THOSE DECISIONS WERE MADE AND I DON'T THINK THE STATE IS ACTING IN GOOD FAITH. IF WE THEN RETROACTIVELY REACH BACK IN DISALLOW THOSE TAX CREDITS I MEAN WE COULD TALK ABOUT DOING PROSPECTIVELY BUT BUT TO HAVE IT BE RETROACTIVE SEEMS TO ME TO BE- TO BE COMPLETELY ON JUST. OP I WANT TO SHIFT DISCUSSION IF I COULD TO THE DISALLOWANCE OF THE DEDUCTION FOR NET OPERATING LOSSES A AND R. I REMEMBER THAT WE DID THIS. THE END DURING THE GREAT RECESSION A SIMILAR A PROHIBITION AGAINST THE USE OF THEM BUT AS I RECALL. THAT PROHIBITION WAS ONLY FOR TWO YEARS AND THAT WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE GREATEST RECESSION SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION- THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR A THREE YEAR DISALLOWANCE OF THOSE NOT A PROPERTY LOSSES- SO I'M WONDERING WHY THREE YEARS WHY NOT TWO YEARS AND WHY IS THIS SITUATION MORE DIRE THAN THAT ONE WAS. AND THE QUESTION OF WHY IT SHOULD BE- WHY WE ARE PROPOSING A THREE YEAR PERIOD RATHER THAN A TWO YEAR PERIOD I'LL COMMENT VERY BRIEFLY IN NINETEEN CHAMBER WHEN THEY- WAIT. WHILE WHILE I. A GREAT VIEW THE PROCESS THE QUE SE IN THE GRAY RECESSION CERTAINLY WHAT WE ARE BEING MAINTAINED- THE MULTI YEAR FORECAST THAT WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PUT FORWARD. IS THAT ACT HAVE BEEN USED. HOWEVER THE THAT WE HAD PROJECTED BY CHEN. FIRST YEARS YOU KNOW ON YEARS OR OR EVEN MORE THAN THAT AND SO WE FELT THAT A THREE YEAR PERIOD OF WHAT'S APPROPRIATE- AND WHEN THE ECONOMY DOES NOT COVER THOSE ENTITIES WITHIN THAT OPERATING LOSSES WILL BE ABLE TO USE THOSE CREDITS SO IN THAT SENSE- THE STATE WOULD ACTUALLY. BE RECEIVING LESS READING YOU IN THOSE YEARS AND WE OTHERWISE WORKED SO I THINK I CAN SPEAK DIRECTLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROJECTIONS THAT WE'RE SEEING NOW WHILE WE VERY MUCH HOPE THAT IN ONE YEAR OR TWO YEARS. I NEED BE GOING UP WELL ABOVE OUR PROJECTIONS RIGHT NOW GIVEN WHAT WE'RE BEING WE BELIEVE THAT THESE TEMPORARY CHANGES YOU NEED TO BE A FACTOR FOR THREE YEARS BECAUSE THE REVENUE GAP THAT WE'RE SEEING ARE NOT. WAIT FOR THE NEXT YEAR BUT ARE FORTY YEARS AFTER THAT. OKAY I'M I'M NOT SURE ON FALL THE RE. BECAUSE NO NO THE PROJECTIONS THAT I'VE SEEN. INDICATE THAT THIS RECESSION IS GOING TO BE MORE SEVERE THAN. THE GREAT RECESSION. AND YOU KNOW THAT SEEMS TO BE THE ARGUMENT THAT THAT YOU'RE MAKING IS THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS THIS THAT MERITS A THREE YEAR. DISALLOWANCE INSTEAD OF A TWO YEAR DISALLOWANCE BUT I MEAN THERE'S A LARGER ISSUE OF FAIRNESS HERE I THINK WHICH IS THAT- THE WE HAVE BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHO ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF AN ACTION. THAT THEIR GOVERNMENT TOOK IN CLOSING DOWN THE ECONOMY IN RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS SO. THOSE BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO REQUIRE AN INJECTION OF CAPITAL. THIS YEAR JUST TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN SO THAT'S GOING TO CREATE A NOT OPERATING LOSS THIS YEAR. THEN TAKE THOSE BUSINESSES THAT NEXT YEAR SURE THEIR BUSINESS COVER A LITTLE BIT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE MAKING A PROFIT. THAT THEY'RE NOT I'M ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT LOSS IN THE CAPITAL WAS REQUIRED TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESS OPEN. I THINK IT'S VERY UNFAIR SO- THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I REALLY A PROBLEM WITH THIS. BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK QUESTIONS FOR. FINANCE OR ALEJO. OKAY SEEING NONE THE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO- PUBLIC COMMENTS IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE GALLERY OR IN PERSON WE HAVE ONE. A MESSAGE MISTERCHAIR MEMBERS A CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF COUNTY THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED TO PROVISIONS OF YOU AS YOU'VE HEARD ME BEFORE. ON SB ONE FOURTEEN WHICH IS THE ANNA WELL SUSPENSION AS WELL AS THE LIMITATION ON TAX CREDIT USAGE BY BUSINESSES- OUR CONCERNS ARE THAT THIS IS TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM BUSINESSES AT A CRITICAL TIME IT WILL LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO INVEST- TO HIRE AND PAY WAGES. AND FRANKLY TO DO MORE ARE IN D. WHICH IS SO CRITICAL AT THIS TIME PERIOD I WOULD NOTE IN ECHO THE COMMENTS OF YOUR VICE CHAIR- OUR CONCERN IS WHEN WE'VE DONE THE AND A WELL SUSPENSION IN THE PRIOR TO INSTANCES IT WAS FOR TWO YEARS AND NOT FOR THREE. WE ACTUALLY URGE YOU TO DO A ONE YEAR AND RE EXAMINE IT THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE THE LEAD. AND IN THE END A WELL FOR TWO YEARS. PREVIOUS IS THERE TIME IF YOU WILL SWEETENERS ON THE IN THEY CAME BACK EXISTENCE. AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT AND ON THE TAX CREDIT THE LAST TIME WE DID THAT WE'VE ONLY DONE IT ONCE. WE DID A 50% LIMITATION SO WE WOULD APPRECIATE AN EITHER OR AND HAVE PROVIDED YOUR COMMITTEE SOME SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD. HOLD MOST OF THE REVENUE INCREASE FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR.
