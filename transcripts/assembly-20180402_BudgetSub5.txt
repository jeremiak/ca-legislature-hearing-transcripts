COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LETTING ME BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY IN TO TESTIFY SPECIAL THANKS ESPECIALLY TO EVERY. FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE. ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR AND YOUR STE TEAMS. HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO BRING STABILITY IMBALANCE IT TO THE STATE AND TO OUR BUDGET. I WANTED TO BE HERE PERSONALLY BECAUSE THIS PROCESS IS CRITICAL TO THE WORK THAT WE DO WITH THE CAR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I WANT TO GIVE A FEW HIGHLIGHTS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE TESTED. FOURTEEN HUNDRED SOME FOURTEEN HUNDRED BREAK IT'S ACTUALLY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN TO BE PRECISE. RAPE GIFTS AT THROUGH OUR RAPID DNA SERVICES PROGRAM. HOW OR THE RATS PROGRAM IS IT'S KNOWN? WE ARE UP TO DATE. IN THOSE RAPE KITS INTESTINE OF THEM AND WE HAVE NO BACKLOG. WE RECOVERED THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE FIREARMS FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE PROHIBITED FROM OWNING THEM. WE SEE WE SECURITY A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT AGAINST ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND. FOR MISLEADING CALPERS AND CASTERS AYE MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES. WE DEFENDED THE FACT ACT. IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. AND WE STOPPED OIL GIANT VALERO FROM MAKING AN ACQUISITION THAT COULD HAVE LED TO HIGHER GAS PRICES FOR CALIFORNIANS. WE ALSO BROUGHT DOWN AND SECURED CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AGAINST A SEX TRAFFICKING RING OPERATING OUT OF TULARE COUNTY. SELLING YOUNG WOMEN MANY UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN FOR SEX. THIS WOULD BE A COMMENDABLE EFFORT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBER. WE ARE LIVING IN EXTRAORDINARY TIMES. SINCE JULY TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE WE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL TIME DEFENDING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AGAINST FEDERAL EXECUTIVE ACTIONS FROM WASHINGTON DC. IT'S A TESTAMENT TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR DEPARTMENT. AS WELL AS THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WHO HELPED US WITH THE RESOURCES WE REQUESTED. THAT WE ARE ABLE TO RESPOND QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO THREATS FROM WASHINGTON DC. SO AGAIN THANK YOU ALL OF YOU AT MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THAT PARTNERSHIP WILL BE CRITICAL AS WE ADDRESS NEW AND. I THINK. ONGOING CHALLENGES FOR OUR STATE. EXAMPLES BUMP IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE MAINTAIN THE CRIME FIGHTING EXCELLENCE OF THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES. FINGERPRINTING DNA TESTING AND CRIME SOLVING TECHNIQUES SERBIA ES MAKE IT A GREAT TV SERIES. EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT BFS IS WORK AND ITS ACCOMPLISHMENTS OUR REAL. THE BUREAU IS SUPPORTED BY THE DNA ID FUND. WHICH IS EXPERIENCING DECLINING REVENUES. THE REVENUE GAP NOW STANDS AT TWENTY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. ON TOP OF THAT THE BUREAU HAS BEEN FORCED TO POSTPONE OR FORGO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NECESSARY EQUIPMENT UPGRADES AND MAINTENANCE. IF WE WANT BUREAU TO CONTINUE. AS THE RELIABLE GO TO CRIME SOLVER THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE RELIES ON. TO PROSECUTE CRIMINALS. WE NEED TO GET SERIOUS AND CLOSER REVENUE GAP. AND WE NEED TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT TO POSSESS TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FORENSIC TOOLS. TO COMBAT TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CRIMES. SECOND OUR DIVISION A LAW ENFORCEMENT IS IN THE THICK OF THE FIGHT AGAINST WHITE COLLAR CRIME. CYBERCRIME. AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. BUT MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE IT EASIER FOR CRIMINALS TO COMMIT THESE OFFENSES. AND THE THREAT CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. WE NEED TO KEEP PACE. I'D ACTUALLY SAY WE NEED TO OUTPACE TODAY'S MARTIN CRIMINALS. THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT A SIX POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO HELP CALIFORNIA PUT UP THE FIGHT. AND PUT MORE CYBER CRIMINALS BEHIND BARS. IN ADDITION OUR CALIFORNIA JUSTICE INFORMATION SYSTEMS DIVISION WHAT WE CALL SEE JUST IS WORKING TO PREVENT CYBER ATTACKS AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ITSELF. AND AGAINST LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE NEED THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF SENSITIVE RECORDS AROUND THE STATE. THESE ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT REQUIRE A CONTINUED FOCUS AND COLLABORATION. ESPECIALLY AS OUR DEPARTMENT FACES A NUMBER OF UNFUNDED MANDATES. THIS YEAR WE HAVE A MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY IMPLEMENT AB THREE EIGHTY FOUR. SIGNED INTO LAW LAST YEAR. WHICH ESTABLISH A TIER BASED SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION SYSTEM. WE ADVISE THE LEGISLATURE. LAST YEAR AS THIS BILL WAS GOING TO THE PROCESS THAT IT WOULD COST. TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT THIS NEW SYSTEM NEXT YEAR ALONE. EVEN WITH HIGHER COSTS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THAT'S BECAUSE IN THIS CASE FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION WHEN IT COMES TO DETERMINING WHEN AND WHETHER SOMEONE CONVICTED OF A SEX OFFENSE MUST REMAIN ON A LIST OF REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS. OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS SIMPLY NOT BUILT FOR THE HUGE VOLUME OF DATA NECESSARY TO MAKE HEARING POSSIBLE. WITHOUT THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING WE IDENTIFIED IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS CHANGE IN THE LAW POSSIBLE. I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THIS LEGISLATION'S REQUIREMENT TO PUT EACH OF THE STATE'S NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND SEX OFFENDER REGISTRANTS. INTO ONE OF THREE TIERS BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ADDITIONALLY WE FACE ANOTHER ONE MILLION DOLLAR UNFUNDED MANDATE ASSOCIATED WITH THREE BILLS FOR WHICH. THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE HAS RECEIVED NO FUNDING. WE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL POSITION AND EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT AB ELEVEN FIFTEEN. A BILL RELATED TO CONVICTIONS AND EXPUNGEMENT. WE NEED THOSE FUNDS TO ENSURE THAT INCREASES IN REQUEST FOR DISMISSALS. OUR PROCESS WITHIN THE REUIRED NINETY K.. TIMEFRAME. BUT WE WERE DENIED THE REQUEST FOR FUNDING AND POSITION. SO I WANT TO ALERT YOU TO THE CHALLENGE THE STATE WILL FACE IN IMPLEMENTING A. B. ELEVEN FIFTY TODAY. WE REQUESTED AN ADDITIONAL TO POSITIONS AND THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ENFORCE AB FOR FIFTY. THE IMMIGRANT WORKER PROTECTION ACT. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS COMPLAINTS THAT THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS WHAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS COMPLAINTS. CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS AND CONDUCTS CIVIL PROSECUTIONS. BUT WE WERE DENIED. ONCE AGAIN WITHOUT THE RESOURCES I CANNOT REPORT TO YOU THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS THE ABILITY TO MEET THESE NEW DEMANDS. GIVEN THE DEPARTMENT'S EXISTING RESPONSIBILITIES. WE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL FIVE POSITIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ENFORCE S. B. THREE NINETY THREE. A BILL RELATED TO SEALING CRIMINAL RECORDS. WE NEED THOSE FUNDS TO ENSURE THAT CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION IS PROPERLY MAINTAINED AND UPDATED. BUT WE WERE DENIED. ITS HARD TO SEE HOW WE ACCOMPLISH THIS NEW WORK WITHOUT THE PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES TO DO IT. AND WE'RE NOT GONNA BE DOING THIS WITH MISTAKES. IT'S TOO IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND IT'S TOO IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO DO IT RIGHT. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT NOTE THAT WE ARE DOING MUCH OF THIS WORK. WITHOUT COMPETITIVE SALARIES. TWO QUICK EXAMPLES. OUR OUR SUPPORT STAFF AND OUR PARALEGALS. THEY MAKE ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT LESS THAN WHAT IS PAID IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I'D LET ME REPEAT THAT THEY DON'T MAKE SICK LITTLE MAKE SIXTY PERCENT OF WHAT YOU MAKE ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR THEY MAKE SIXTY PERCENT OF LESS. THEM FOLKS OUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOING THE SAME WORK. OUR DIVISION A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS THE FOLKS WHO PETRY WEAPONS FROM BALANCE. THE FOLKS WHO DO THE THE CHECK ON EVIDENCE FORENSICS AND OTHER WHITES. ARE THERE PAID APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN PERCENT BELOW OTHER STATE AND A LOCAL POLICE OFFICER. IT IS TOUGH TO COMPETE. TO GET THE BEST. AND OUR HIGH SALARIES FOR SENIOR TURNS. WELL THEIR COMPARABLE TO WHAT A LAW SCHOOL GRADUATE FROM A PRESTIGIOUS LAW SCHOOL. COULD MAKE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IN HIS OUR FIRST YEAR. OUT OF LAW SCHOOL. AS A LAWYER. THAT'S ONE HERE TO. TELL YOU TODAY. THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS COMMITTEE. TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE BUDGET CHALLENGES WE FACE. TO RECAP DUE TO THE REVENUE GAP THEN UNFUNDED MANDATES ARE DEPARTMENTS IS IN A DIRECT HOLE OF THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITION TO A WORKFORCE THAT IS AND HAS BEEN UNDERPAID. I'M ASKING THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. MEMBERS OF MY OFFICE ARE READY TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE STAFF TO IRON OUT FUNDING DETAILS. I KNOW IT IS NOT AN EASY REQUEST BUT THERE IS NO MISSION MORE IMPORTANT FOR US AND TO PROTECT ALL CALIFORNIANS AND THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE TOGETHER. I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT TOGETHER WE CAN FIND A WAY TO MEET WITH THE CHALLENGES AHEAD. AND REMAIN THE STATE THAT LEADS THE NATION WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR OF SUMMIT ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR MANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND AND THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE COMMITTEE AYE I KNOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL. DISCUSSIONS ON. I'M VERY OF TOPICS. AND I WANNA ADD TO TO TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TO ASK FOR BUT WE. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT UP CANNABIS AND THE OUR INABILITY TO CRACKDOWN ON THE BLACK MARKET AND ILLEGAL BACK MORE STATEWIDE. AND I BELIEVE USED TO BE A A BUREAU OF NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT THAT WAS HERE DURING DISCOURSE BUT I BELIEVE THAT BUDGET GOT SLASHED IN HALF AND EVENTUALLY. pUNDERSTANDING THAT THE COORDINATION BETWEEN. ON THE FEDERAL TO THE STATE AND LOCAL I WAS COORDINATED BUDDHIST GROUP INNATE DID. SUPERB JOB AT THAT GOING AFTER THEY'D BE THE COORDINATOR TRAFFICKING HERE AND IN CALIFORNIA. AND. WOULD LOVE TO TRY TO RECREATE THAT. LOVE TO HAVE IT PAID FOR. BY THE INDUSTRY ITSELF BECAUSE I THINK IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST. TO CRACKDOWN ON THE BLACK MARKET BECAUSE THEY GO MOBILE TO THRIVE. AND I BELIEVE WE'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AND SIZE. IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO DO THAT ESPECIALLY IF WE COULD BE AS COST NEUTRAL AS POSSIBLE. WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING YOU LIKE FOR US TO LOOK INTO ARE FROM PEOPLE LIKE TO. TO SUPPORT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER JONES SAWYER WE ARE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. WITH YOU AND OTHERS IN THE LEGISLATURE. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE A STATEWIDE ENFORCEMENT ARM THAT WILL HANDLE CANNABIS. THEIR IS NO WAY THAT THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WILL BE A TO HANDLE THIS BY THEMSELVES THERE HAS TO BE COORDINATION. I ACTUALLY THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. COULD. HANDLE THIS. WITH. AND NOT JUST GREAT EXPERIENCE BUT AS YOU MENTION WE DID VERY WELL WHEN WE DID HAVE. THE BUREAU THAT DEALT WITH NARCOTICS. AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE'D MOVED QUICKLY. THAT WE WOULD UNDER RESOURCE THE NEED TO GET THIS DONE RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE US A US. A SMALL WINDOW BEFORE. THIS BEGINS TO OVERWHELM. STATE AND OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. BECAUSE. CANNABIS AS AN INDUSTRIES IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW. WHETHER IT GROWS. AS A ABOVE THE TABLE MARKET OR UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. IS UP TO US AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL BE CRITICAL TO MAKE SURE THE FOLKS WANT TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. AREN'T BURDENED BY TRYING TO COMPETE WITH THOSE WHO WANT TO DO IT THE WRONG WAY. TWO NOTE LOVE TO WORK WITH ME ON AT ANY. TING YOU NEED OUR HELP ON IT TO TO FURTHER THAT I THINK THIS COMMITTEE. WOULD BE. RECEPTIVE TO THAT I KNOW YOU HAVE A. BIG THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET AFTER RIGHT NOW BUT. THIS IS WE THOMAS. SIX BILLION DOLLAR. ENTERPRISE IT IT'S WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE I SUCCESSFUL TOO BECAUSE THE MONIES THAT COME IN FROM THAT. COOK ULTIMATELY HELP FUND OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND THEN I. I KNOW YOU. DID YOU DO JG JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO POLICE SHOOTINGS. AND I DON'T KNOW IF. YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT ANY DO YOU NEED ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES DO YOU NEED. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. AS WE MOVE FOR. YOUR DEPARTMENT DOING MORE OF AN. OBVIOUS HIS COMMITTEE WOULD MAKE SURE. YOU WELL RESOURCE. TO DO THAT HOPEFULLY WE DON'T HAVE TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD AGAIN. WE HOPE WE NEVER HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER SHOOTING OF THIS MAGNITUDE. BUT IF WE DO I THINK IS REALLY GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC. AND THEIR TRUST AND IT ALL PHASES OF GOVERNMENT THAT WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT ARE. TECH INCOME IN. AND PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE LOOK AT WHAT. WAS DONE WHAT HAPPENED BUT MORE PORTABLE WE NEED TO DO IN THE FUTURE WHICH I THINK A LOT OF TIMES THAT THAT'S MISSING SO. I KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE WORKING ON SOMETHING SACRAMENTO NOW BUT HOW DO YOU SEE THE DEPARTMENT MOVING FORWARD. NOW ONLY WITH WITH THAT PARTICULAR INCIDENT BUT WHAT RESOURCES. AND MONEY YOU NEED NOW I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS I REMEMBER. YOU READ OFF ALL THESE BABIES. AND I REMEMBER AYING ISIS IT WHERE YOU'RE SITTING AT A. AS IT THAT'S KIND OF A BUREAUCRAT AND THESE ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL COME OVER ALL THESE LAWS BUT IT WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH MONEY ENOUGH RESOURCES. SOMETIMES WOULD NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT IDEA BUT I HAD TO IMPLEMENT. AND IF IT FAILED I GOT BLAMED FOR TIME. I'M GOING. BACKWARDS OR I'M GOING FORWARD AND ACTUALLY ASKING WOULD YOU NEED HOW YOU DO IT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY. PUT SOMETHING ON MORE THINGS ON YOUR PLATE. THEN THE REST THAT'S ALL FAIR AND. THE ONE THING I I COMMITTEE YOU IS THAT I I MONEY I'M GONNA TRY TO BE AS STRAIGHT SHOOTERS I CAN'T ON THIS HIGH HAVING SAT WHERE YOU ARE. AND LISTENING TO EXECUTIVES TRY TO TELL ME WHAT THEY NEEDED IT IN THEIR AGENCIES BUDGET. I LEARNED WHAT HAPPENED WHEN AN AGENCY FEELS SOMEWHAT CONSTRAINED TO SAY. WHAT IT REALLY NEEDS BECAUSE OF THE? THE BUDGET THAT THEY'RE HANDED AND I WOULD I'D RATHER YOU KNOW WHAT NOW IF I CAN MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN. TO RESEARCH HAS I HAVE RATHER THAN YOU HAVE HAVE BECOME APPEARANCE IT WHAT HAPPENED WHY DID YOU GET IT DONE. AND I'VE LAID OUT TO USE SOME OF THEUNFUNDED MANDATES THINGS THAT I KNOW I CANNOT DO BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESEARCH ON I WANTED ON THE RECORD NOW. SO THERE'S NO QUESTION IF I COME BACK WHY SAID HE DIDN'T HAPPEN BUT IF YOU GIVE ME THE RESOURCES. THAT IS ON ME AND I WILL I ACCEPT THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE IT HAPPEN. OKAY AS FAR AS. FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS. THAT LET LET US PLAY THIS OUT AND SEE WHERE IT GOES. AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE. DEPARTMENT THAT IS FILLED TO THE BRIM WHEN IT COMES TO WORK. I DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. TO DO INVESTIGATIONS THE WAY THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO. BUT I DO KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING PROGRESS. SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS COMMUNITY TRUST WITH WITH THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IN SACRAMENTO. THE CHIEF DANIEL HAHN REACHED OUT CHIEF OF POLICE DE HAAN REACH OUT TO ME AND I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT. TO WORK WITH AT THE DEPARTMENT IN THIS CASE. AND TRAIN PROVIDED INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT SOME INDEPENDENT EYES LOOKING AT THE. THOUGH INVESTIGATION. ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THE CHIEF AND THE DEPARTMENT AND THE CITY LEADERS WERE WILLING TO AGREE THAT WE WOULD TAKE A BROADER VIEW. OF THE POLICING PRACTICES A REVIEW OF THE PROTOCOLS THE PROCEDURES THE POLICIES THE TRAINING WHICH I THINK ULTIMATELY GETS YOU TO THE ROOT CAUSE OF THESE TYPES OF THE. THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW THE QUESTION. DO I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. AND SAID THINK WITH RESPECT TO CANNABIS THE. A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE STATE LOOKED AT IS THE THE GOOSE THOSE LAYING GOLDEN EGGS AND IT'S NOT. AND UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THAT IS ALSO DRIVING THE BLACK MARKET. AND FOR WHATEVER RESOURCES THAT I THINK IT'S IT'S LEGITIMATE FOR YOU TO BE ASKING FOR RESOURCES FOR THAT. I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT WE'RE CHARGING THAT INDUSTRY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGITIMATE INDUSTRY THRIVES. AND DOES WELL BECAUSE IT'S HERE AND IT'S GOING TO BE HERE AND THEN DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO. THIS INCENTIVIZE THE BLACK MARKET. BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE. REALLY THE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES THAT ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF THE. BUT ALSO ON THE LINE IN AND I THINK THAT'S WHY. YOU'RE WISE TO BE HERE AND AND ENGAGE WITH US AND BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT. WHAT? CHALLENGES THAT DAY YOU ARE FACING AND THERE'S A IN THAT VEIN THERE'S A BILL THAT'S COMING THROUGH MY COMMITTEE. ON A NEW BUREAU OR A NOTION OF A NEW BUREAU FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN WORKING THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. QUITE. ABED AND LATELY REALLY STARTING TO UNDERSTAND HOW ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. IS A LANGUAGE AND A PERSPECTIVE THAT'S NOT ALWAYS VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD HERE BUT IT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA FOR CALIFORNIA MOVING FORWARD. SO THAT THAT BILL IS MOVING THROUGH POLICY COMMITTEE BUT IT'S REALLY A BUDGET QUESTION. AND I KNOW THERE'S A LETTER HERE. OUR COLLEAGUE MR GARCIA HAS HAS PUT A LETTER FOR HOW DO YOU HOW WOULD YOU SEE THAT ASSUMING THAT WE FUNDED AND I'M CERTAINLY VERY SUPPORTIVE. OF. THAT THAT EFFORT ENSURING THAT THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE DID. MAKE SURE THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THE WORST IMPACTED BY SOME THE BARBELL DEGRADATION OR BEING WERE. TREATED RESPECTFULLY AND AND TREATED APPROPRIATELY AS WE TRY AND FORCE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THAT'S SORT OF HOW I WOULD SEE HOW HOW WOULD YOU SEE THAT COMING TOGETHER. I I THINK FOR THE LONGEST TIME WE'VE LOOKED AT. THE ISSUE OF PROTECTING ARM FIREMAN. AND HANDLING. OUR ACTIONS IN DEFENSE OF CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER. A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT AS A GLOBAL ISSUE. AND I OFTENTIMES WHAT WE DISCOUNT IN THAT PERSPECTIVE IS THAT. THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HIT. FIRST. AND HARDEST. AND ARE LEAST EQUIPPED. TO ADDRESS THE ILLS THAT COME FROM DEGRADATION OF OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING FOR THESE COMMITTEES EARLY. WE MISSED THE BOAT. BECAUSE. THESE ARE COMMUNITIES HAD BEEN LIVING WITH. LEAD TAINTED HOMES FOR A LONG TIME. AND FOR THEM THE NEED IS IMMEDIATE THESE ARE HOMES THAT HAVE. BEEN IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE RIGHT NEXT TO ALL THE WHERE ALL THE FREEWAYS HAVE BEEN BUILT. AND HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH EMISSIONS FROM A. TAILPIPES FOR DECADES AND SO FOR THEM IT IT'S REAL TO HAVE. A REDUCTION IN THEM AND IN A MATTER OF. POLLUTING EMISSIONS FROM VEHICLES BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF THE LAST TO COULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE COME UP WITH BECAUSE OUR SOLUTIONS ARE VERY GLOBAL. WHERE MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES NEED A DISTANCE IMMEDIATELY THAT'S WHY AS AS ACCOMPLISH AS? OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SECTION HAS BEEN IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARE LEGAL SECTION. AT IN DEALING WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. I THOUGHT IT WAS CRUCIAL THAT WE HAVE A BUREAU THAT WAS DEDICATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. SO THAT THESE COMMUNITIES HAD SOMEBODY ON THEIR SITE EARLY. AND LOOKING AT THEIR PLIGHT NOW VERSES IN THAT GLOBAL. SOLUTION THAT WE COME UP WITH. AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE GONNA FIND IS THAT WE'RE GONNA TAYLOR ARE SOLUTIONS A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFULLY WHEN WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THESE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. WORRIED ABOUT TWENTY FIFTY WHEN IT COMES TO POLLUTION THEY'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE CAR EXHAUST LIVING NEXT THE FREEWAY WHERE THEY'VE BEEN HAVING TO WASTE INCINERATION PLANTS LOCATED IN THEIR BACKYARD WHERE THEY'VE HAD THE. EGGS AYE BATTERY RECYCLING PLANT IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD ALL THE TIME. AND THEY NEED NOW AND SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK ENVIRONMENT THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BUREAU THAT WE WANT TO ESTABLISH. WILL BE CRITICAL TO MAKE SURE WE HAD THAT. EXTRA THINKING GOING ON WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. DEALING WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IT IF I COULD JUST ADD AS A MEMBER JUST GROUP QUICKLY ON THE UP. THE THE CANNABIS ISSUE. IF I CAN SAY IS ON BEHALF OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT? THEY WE. WE NEED YOUR HELP. YESTERDAY. IT'S IT'S ALMOST IT'S ALMOST A VICIOUS CYCLE. THE SLOWER WE ACTED TO TRY TO ATTACK THE. UNDERGROUND PART OF THIS ECONOMY ON CANNABIS. THE LESS RESOURCE WE COLLECT. IN LICENSE SEEN AND TAXATION SO FORTH THE LESS RESEARCH WE HAVE THE LESS MONEY WE HAVE TO SEND OUT TO THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. LESS MONEY THEY GET THE LESS ENFORCEMENT THEY CAN DO THE LESS ENFORCEMENT THEY DO THE MORE THE GUYS ARE DOING LEGITIMATELY SAY WAIT A MINUTE I'M BE UNDERCUT. DRAMATICALLY BY THE GUYS ARE DOING IT THE WRONG WAY. AND IT BECOMES A VICIOUS CYCLE WHERE ALMOST BECOMES BETTER TO DO IT UNDERGROUND. THEY DO IT ABOVE THE TAPE. AND. I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD PRIORITIZE. PUTTING MONEY IN THE HANDS OF THE FOLKS WHO HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S DONE RIGHT BECAUSE IF IT STARTS TO BE DONE WRONG. IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ON WINE THAT AND WE WILL RUE THE DAY WHEN WE FOR GOT TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THIS NEW INDUSTRY. ESTABLISHES FOOTING. IN THE RIGHT WAY AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT YOU GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF POLICE CHIEFS AND SHERIFFS. AND STATE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT. OFFICERS LIKE ME ARE ARE HAVING TO DO THIS WORK RIGHT NOW. WITH NO NEW RESOURCES SO FAR TO DEAL WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT CALLED THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. AND WE BETTER GET A GRIP FAST BECAUSE I I COULD EASILY SEE THE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA. SWING OF THE PENDULUM IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS IT THIS IS NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED. THIS TO LOOK LIKE BUT TRY TO ON WINE THAT. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY AND YOU WILL FIND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT SO GET IT DONE RIGHT. GET IT DONE THE FIRST TIME HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. IT'S NOT JUST THE RIGHT THING TO DO WITH THE RIGHT WAY. THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT. AND I IN I DO AGREE WITHOUT THAT I THINK SOME OF THE INITIAL INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE WITH REVENUES COMING IN IS FOR THE ENFORCEMENT BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND. CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT AND ENSURE WE WE CREATE A STRONG AND HEALTHY LEGITIMATE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. AND ON THE EMISSIONS YOU ARE CORRECT THAT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IN TOTAL BUT IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE EMISSIONS AND WE HAVE NOT LINK THOSE EMISSIONS TO THE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS WHICH IS WHY. WE HAVE SUCH STARK HEALTH OUTCOMES IN VERY SELECT. UNDERSERVED THEY'RE ALL UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. ACROSS CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS OUTSIDE I DO SUPPORT US HELPING YOU. CREATOR BUREAU OF. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE FOR. US TO MAKE A STATEMENT OF HOW IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS BUT THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND IT'S A THREE AND HALF MILLION DOLLAR ASK I THINK THAT. IS. PRETTY SMALL COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER ASSETS THAT ARE HERE BUT. EVEN STILL. YEAH IT'S IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN. WE CAN HELP SUPPORT YOU THINK YOUNGSTERS WILL AND. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN. MISTER BRACERO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU I AM I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE SUCCESSES THAT YOU HAVE HAD IN YOUR DEPARTMENT. I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THOUGH. I KNOW. I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT YOU ARE. I THINK YOU'RE ASKING FOR TOO MUCH SHOULD YOU STATE THIRTY THREE. MILLION. MORE. SO YOU WOULD NEED THIRTY THREE MILLION MORE AND I UNDERSTAND THIS IS THIS IS ALWAYS A CASE WHERE YOU NEVER HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE. TO DO THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE TO DO I GET THAT WERE ALL IN THAT SITUATION BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. PRECEDING YOUR TENURE IN THAT OFFICE OF COURSE WAS GIVEN TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN SOME SUPPLEMENTAL MONEY TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. TO GET THESE. GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM THOSE WHO ARE YOU NOW MENTALLY. DISTURBED THOSE WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM ANYWAY AND WE'RE STILL WE STOP ABOUT TEN THOUSAND GUNS. OUT THERE WHICH I THINK YOU KNOW NO MATTER WHAT SIDE OF THE POLITICAL AISLE YOUR ONLINE THAT BECAUSE YOU GRAY CONCERNING OR CAUSES ME GREAT CONCERN SO. I WOULD JUST LIKE FOR YOU TO. CAN YOU EIGHT CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MUCH LONGER IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO GET. THE REMAINDER OF THOSE GUNS OFF THE STREET AND I UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY DAY YOU HAVE SOME NEW PEOPLE ADDED TO THE LIST I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THE PEOPLE. WHO? WHO YOU WERE GIVEN NOT YOU BUT YOUR DEPARTMENT YOU'RE GIVEN MONEY TO GO AFTER HOW MUCH LONGER IS IT GOING TO TAKE BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT THE DATA? IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU MANY MORE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL THOSE WEAPONS SO COULD YOU JUST SPEAK THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION I'M GONNA TRY TO KEEP THIS BRIEF AND. BECAUSE I'VE NEVER HEARING TO GET YOU ACTUALLY SO IF YOU COULD JUST RESPOND ABOUT APPRECIATE THAT RATE. AND I'VE GOT A STEVE THEN THE WHO IS THE. DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU FIREARMS WHO IS HERE WITH ME AS WELL WHO CAN GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS. ARE I KNOW THAT THE TWO OF THE TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU MENTIONED AND NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS A DIMENSION THAT WE GOT WE GOT TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A FEW YEARS BACK. TO START TO REALLY DEAL WITH THE BACKLOG BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED EVERY DAY MORE A WEEK THERE MORE WEAPONS PRESS TO COLLECT BECAUSE YOU'RE MORE PEOPLE WHO ON THIS LIST WHO NO LONGER. HAVE THE RIGHT TO POSSESS FIREARMS. A IF. WE HAD DONE NOTHING. WE WOULD HAVE. SOME. STEVE KIRBY FROM RON BUT IT'S FORTY SOME ODD THOUSAND OR SO. HERE WE GO THINK WE GOT A NICE HANDY CHART HERE. THE BLUE LINE SHOWS YOU WHERE WE WERE. FOR WE WERE ABLE TO START COLLECTING WEAPONS AND AS YOU CAN SEE. WE WOULD BE OVER FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND WEAPONS THAT WOULD BE OUT THERE IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE GOOD WRITING THAT CHART OKAY SO WE'RE DOWN TO TEN THOUSAND. SO THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THAT THAT RESOURCES THAT WE GOT BUT. BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE WEAPONS A COMMAND AND NOW THAT THE THOSE WEAPONS THAT ARE STILL OUT ARE PROBABLY HOPE BY PEOPLE WHO ARE. MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO GET THEM FROM. WHEN YOU HAVE TEAMS THAT HAVE AND YOU DON'T GO OUT BY YOURSELF TO GO COLLECT IT'S A TEAM. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO HAVE ENOUGH TEAMS TO GO OUT THERE TO TRY TO COLLECT WEAPONS. WOULD MAKE IT A REQUEST FOR SOMEBODY TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO GO OUT THERE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL OPERATION. NOT ONE INCIDENT AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOLKS MANY OF THEM FELONS WHO HAVE LOST THE RIGHT TO POSSESS THESE WEAPONS BUT NOT ONE INCIDENT WHERE ANYONE. OBVIOUSLY NOT ARE SPECIAL AGENTS OR OTHERS HAVE BEEN HARMED THIS IS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AND I WOULD TELL YOU THAT. THE WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THE LEGISLATURE GAVE US WE'VE WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO BRING DOWN THE NUMBERS BUT TO GET ITDOWN TO ESSENTIALLY OPERATIONALLY ZERO WHERE YOU STILL. HAVE A CONSTANT FLOW OF IT WE WILL NEED SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SO HERE'S HERE'S MY QUESTION TO YOU BECAUSE AGAIN THIS I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PROCEED YOU BUT. IT'S YOUR BABY NOW SEVERAL IT IS. SO I HAVE THE CHART HERE THE SUPPLEMENTAL MONEY FOR THE APPS PROGRAM SO IF YOU COMBINE THAT WITH. THE TWENTY FOUR MILLION THAT THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED IT COMES UP TO ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS SINCE. BY TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TIME PRINT SO AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE TOLD. AND I THINK THE EXACT WORDS WERE. HOW MUCH WOULD YOU NEED IF YOU COULD GIVE OUT ANY NUMBER WHAT WOULD IT BE AND WE WERE TOLD TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS HOW MUCH WE NEED TO GET THE JOB DONE? AND IT'S NOW TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THE JOB ISN'T DONE SO. FOR ME IT'S. WHEN WE GONNA LAND ON THE RIGHT NUMBER AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHEN WE'RE GONNA GET THESE WEAPONS SO THAT NO ONE GETS HURT. BECAUSE IT WAS TWENTY FOUR MILLION IT'S TURNED INTO SEVENTY MILLION AND THAT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH I KNOW BY THE WAY WE NEED THIRTY THREE MILLION MORE FOR THIS AND NINE MORE DID. YOU KNOW TO POSITIONS FOR THAT I MEAN. YOU YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS SIDE OF THE DIET IS SO YOU GET WHERE I'M COMING FROM MY HOPE. AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE WE ARE IN THIS PROCESS SYLMAR LET ME AT ASK. THE DIRECTOR MISTER LINDLEY TO TRY TO RESPOND BECAUSE THAT IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WELL AND THOSE MONIES I KNOW WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. AND I KNOW THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE SO FAR BUT LET ME SEE IF MISTER LINDE CONTRACT CLARIFY ON THE NUMBERS. SO. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION THAT YOU AND OTHERS HAVE HAD WITH THE GAPS PROGRAM BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL. SO ONE IS THERE HAS BEEN ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION SINCE OUR APPS STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. AND THEN IN WHEN WE RECEIVED A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. FRANCIS LONGER RETENTION STARTED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY FOURTEEN. APPS PRIOR TO THAT WAS BASED ONLY ON HAND IN INFORMATION. HISTORICALLY HANDGUN AND LONG GUN COM REGISTRATIONS ARE PRODUCES ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY SO NOW WE HAVE DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION. THAT PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE THAT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY PROHIBIT PEOPLE ON TOP OF THAT WE'VE HAD A LARGE INCREASE IN GUN SALES. YOU KNOW STARTED TWENTY AROUND TWENTY ELEVEN. SO. WIN APPS WAS FIRST STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX CONSEILS AROUND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN GUN CELLS ARE PEAKED AT ONE POINT THREE I'M TRYING TO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. A GUN CELLS PETE AT ONE POINT THREE MILLION. AND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS REDUCED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OR SO IT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND. OUR GUNS HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE DEALING WITH A MUCH LARGER NUMBER OF GUN CELLS AND POTENTIALLY. FOUR MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE BECOMING PROHIBITED. JUST KEEPING UP THE NUMBERS WE HAVE WITH THE STAFFING THAT WE HAVE. DOES THE BEST WE CAN DO BUT FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ONLY FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT PEOPLE WERE REMOVED FROM THAT LIST. THAT'S NOT A VERY HIGH NUMBER. WOW. WE DID HAVE THAT YEAR IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH IT EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE PEOPLE SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PEOPLE REMOVED FROM THE LECTURE TALKING FOR ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT. YOU ALSO HAVE YOU ARE AS WELL YOU ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE ADDED TO THAT SYSTEM DURING THE SAME TIMEFRAME. SO WITH THE GRAPH THEREOF SHOWING PEOPLE ARE ON THE LIST HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW MANY GUNS YOU BEEN ABLE TO CONFISCATED TO BAIT THE WHAT. THE RELEVANCY IS HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU'VE ACTUALLY GONE AND VISITED TO TRY TO RETRIEVE THOSE WEAPONS FOR. I'M NOT LIKE I GET IT IT'S DANGEROUS WORK I'M JUST TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHY IS THIS TAKING SO LONG AND WHY IS IT WE NEED MORE MONEY WE NEED MORE MONEY WHEN. WE ASKED REACHED FOR THIS YOU KNOW THIS GUY WHAT DO YOU WANT HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU NEED AND WE GAVE IT TO THE DOJ AND. WE'RE STILL NOT THERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK. IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT. THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH WE TWENTY THIRTEEN ARE NOT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE OPERATING UNDER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE NOW WE'VE ADDED THE LONG GUNS TO THE LIST VERSUS JUST THE. THE REGULAR FARMS THAT WERE ON THE LIST REGIONALLY OR WHETHER IT'S A FACT THAT WE'VE SEEN THE GUN PURCHASES GO UP DRAMATICALLY IN THAT TIME. AND BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SECURE WEAPONS FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE MORE WILLING TO. TURN THEM OVER PERHAPS IN THE EARLIER YEARS AND SO NOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WITH AND TAKE A LOT MORE EFFORT. BUT WHATEVER THE FACTOR IT'S IT IT'S TAKING OUR VIA THE TIME THAT YOU SEE. AND THE RESOURCES THAT YOU SEE THE FUNDING THAT WE GOT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE THIS IS ONLY TEMPORARY FUNDING. WITHOUT A REPRIEVE WE'RE GONNA BE IN EVEN WORSE SHAPE WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO REMOVE THOSE WEAPONS. BUT I THINK WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY REMOVING. WEAPONS FROM THOSE WHO LOST THE RIGHT TO POSSESS THEM AND IT'S A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT IF YOU WANT US TO GIVE UP MORE THAN WE HAVE MY TEAM COME A. BRIEF YOU SPECIFICALLY ON THIS OR IF THERE'S A NEAT YOU PROVIDE A BREAKDOWN OF THE NUMBERS I'D MORE THAN WE DO THAT I THINK THERE'S ANYTHING TO HIDE IN THIS PROGRAM. IT JUST THE TASK IT'S A IT'S A. MONUMENTAL TASK BUT THE ONLY STATE THAT DOES IT. AND IT'S NOT AS IF WE CAN LEARNED FROM OTHERS BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS. IF THOSE WEAPONS HAD REMAIN THOSE MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND WEAPONS EVERY REMOVED FROM PEOPLE FAST YOU REMAIN IN THEIR HANDS. WE BE EVEN MORE PANICKED. NO QUESTIONS. ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. BOB ONE OF THANK YOU FOR COMING WE'VE GOT THE LIST OF YOUR REQUEST AND OUR STAFF WILL BE WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF TO SEE WHAT WE CAN RESULT WE ACCOMPLISH. IN THE BUDGET THIS COMING YEAR. I THINK THE REQUEST A REASONABLE IF WE EXPECT THINGS TO HAPPEN AND WITH REPAIRS BILLS THAT NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED WE EXPECT THEM TO BE IMPLEMENTED. SOMETIMES IT ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THAT BUT WE DO OCCASIONALLY AND SO I'VE GOT THE LIST. Y. STEPHENS LIST AND WILL WORK WITH YOUR STAFF VENTURE THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS. I JUST HAD NO NOT ONLY QUICK QUESTION I APOLOGIZE I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT THE WEAPONS THAT WE WERE STILL TALKING ABOUT. I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU REAL GENERALLY. WHAT WOULD YOU ENVISION DOJ'S ROLE? TO BE IN CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY WE HAD ADDRESS SAID A BIT WITH THE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOINTS JONES SAWYER. WE'RE READY A IF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WANT US TO JUMP IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO'VE DONE THIS BEFORE DEALT WITH. THINGS I CANNABIS. SO WE'D BE READY WE JUST WOULD NEED TO STAFF UP. TELL THEM TO MEET THIS NEED BECAUSE WE LOST AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER MENTIONED WHEN HE WAS. DISCUSSING THIS MATTER THAT WE LOST A GREAT NUMBER OF PERSONNEL WHO ARE EXPERT IN THIS. BUT I DO AS I SAID BELIEVE WE NEED A STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATION. WE HAVE A SHORT WINDOW TO DO THIS RIGHT. WE NEED TO BE THERE TO HELP LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. DO THE JOB BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES AYE AYE. THINK ABOUT THE FOLKS IN THESE RURAL COUNTIES THAT ARE MASSIVE WE HAVE LOST SMALL. OUR AGENCIES LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IT IS A BEAR AND SO WE HAVE A SEARCH SHORT WINDOW TO GET THIS DONE. WE'RE READY STEP TO THE PLATE SO LONG AS THE OTHER RESOURCE ARE PUT THERE BEFORE HAS I WOULD ARGUE THAT OUR WINDOW IS ALREADY OVER. A SENTRY GUARDING MADE THIS SUBSTANCE. AS OF JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND OUR FORSMAN. ASPECT IS QUITE EMBARRASSING QUITE HONESTLY. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT MAYBE WE COULD EVEN CONSIDER NARAL USING DOJ BUT MAYBE EVEN MARRYING. THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHER STATE AGENCY OF CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL TO WORK IN CONCERT TOGETHER. AND MAYBE HAVE SOME PLAN THAT WE COULD IMPLEMENT RIGHT AWAY. BECAUSE WE NEED THE ENFORCEMENT NOW WE NEEDED IT MONTHS AGO. AND IT'S NOT A PLACE SO. WE'RE READY THAT THAT'S MY REQUEST IS THAT WE WOULD. YOU WANT TO JOIN THE TWO TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND THANK YOU FOR COMING BENCHES AND THANK YOU ALL THE MEMBERS THANK YOU. WHEN I MOVED TO ITEM NUMBER TWO. WHICH IS ARE ANTITRUST WORKED LOW. OKAY. OKAY LIBYA MANAGER CHRIS RYAN. I CHIEF OF OPERATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE SO THIS THAT BE CP REQUESTS. TWENTY THREE POSITIONS AND AND A WHOLE. AND. IN THE FIRST YEAR BECAUSE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS EIGHTEEN NOW. IT WILL COME FROM FINANCE. IMAGE I WORTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WE. SUPPORT THIS REQUEST FOR ONGOING RESOURCES AS THEIR NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE INCREASE THE WORKLOAD FOR THE SECTION. I ALSO ANOTHER THESE ARE SPECIAL FUNDS. RESOURCES THAT WILL BE USED TO FUND THE POSITIONS OF TO THE EXTENT AND IT COMES FROM SETTLEMENT SO TO THE EXTENT. SETTLEMENTS DON'T COME IN WE CAN ALWAYS RE EVALUATE THE REQUESTED RESOURCES. NO FINANCE OLEO. ANY REALLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE ARE RECOMMENDING NOT APPROVING THE MULTI YEAR PLAN. IT WOULD EFFECTIVELY DOUBLE THE STAFFING SIZE OF THE SECTION INSTEAD WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVING THE POSITIONS AND RESOURCES REQUESTED FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT DOJ TO SUBMIT A REPORT BY DECEMBER FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. ON ON THE IMPACT OF THE POSITIONS THAT ARE PROVIDED IN THESE CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE. THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT ARE PURSUED AND INVESTIGATED AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT GENERATE. MONETARY RECOVERIES WE ARE RECOMMENDING PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS THE SECTION HAS REPORTED TURNING AWAY OUR BACKLOG IN CASES AS WELL AS ITS ATTORNEYS WORKING SIGNIFICANT OVER TIME. HOWEVER. IT IS UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS TOTAL SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD TO JUSTIFY ALL OF THE REQUESTED POSITIONS. ON YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WILL SUFFICIENT NEW CASES BE GENERATED AND THEN GENERATE THE SETTLEMENT REVENUES BECAUSE UNLIKE THE EXISTING POSITIONS ALL OF THESE POSITIONS WILL BE SUPPORTED BY THAT TYPE OF REVENUE. IT'S ALSO SYMBOLIC IS THAT IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE REQUESTED POSITIONS WOULD BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUE CURRENTLY DOJ REPORTS THAT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ITS INVESTIGATED CASES TURN INTO LITIGATION WITH THE POSSIBILITY. OF GENERATING SETTLEMENT REMINISCENCE UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS PERCENTAGE WILL INCREASE AND TO WHAT EXTENT TO GENERATE THE REVENUES TO SUPPORT THE NEW POSITIONS. BUT. YOU COME TO ANY OF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT ON THEY'LL USE A YES MY NAME IS KATHLEEN FOOTE I'M THE CHIEF OF THE ANTITRUST UNIT WITHIN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. AYE WITH REGARD TO SELL FUNDING WHICH IS CERTAINLY LEGITIMATELY A CONCERN OF YOURS. THERE IS NO LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELF FUNDING OF MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MATTERS THAT WEEK THAT WE PURSUE. ARE ACTUALLY NOT. MONEY GENERATORS FOR THE SECTION A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE FULLER A CASE THAT DATA. IDEA TOURNEY GENERAL MENTIONED IN HIS SIGHT AND HIS INITIAL REMARKS. MERGERS IN GENERAL. CAN BE INORDINATELY IMPORTANT TO OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN'T NECESSARILY RELY. ON FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO PROTECT US. WE HAVE SPECIAL ISSUES AND SPECIAL NEEDS. IN AREAS LIKE AGRICULTURE A IN GENERAL WHAT HAPPENS IS IF IF ITS A GOOD CASE THE PARTIES WILL SIMPLY WALK AWAY FROM THE MERGER THEY'LL ABANDON THE TRANSACTION. BEFORE LAWSUIT IS FILED BY SO THERE'S NO TRIAL AND THERE'S NO WAY TO RECOUP. BY THE INVESTIGATIVE COSTS. SO. TO TO MOVE ALL OF OUR RESOURCES INTO PURSUING. SO FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES HAS NEVER MADE SENSE FOR THE SECTION AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S NEVER BEEN FULLY SELF FUNDED BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT IT ISN'T SOME OTHER AREAS. THERE'S NO LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT BUT OF COURSE IF WE PURSUE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES IT TAKES RESOURCES AWAY FROM. DOES OF THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT WE THINK UP MATTER. IT AT LEAST AS MUCH IF NOT MORE OUGHT TO TO THE ECONOMY BY IT IT IT CERTAINLY. IT WAIT WE CAN SHIFT THAT MIX. IT ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE WOULD RECOMMEND BUT WHAT IT WHAT IT WOULD MEAN IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT. AT WHATEVER LEVEL. WE CAN MEET THE SELF FINANCING NOT. BECOME IT'S A QUESTION FROM MEMBERS THIS LACKEY AGAIN JUST REAL QUICK. DISCUSSION PIECE OF IF I COULD JUST USE SOME NUMBERS MAYBE. I'M NOT SAYING IT STRAIGHT BUT THIS IS THE NUMBERS AND LOOKING AT. THE AYE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. FROM A SPECIAL FUND INCREASE. THE NUMBER OF. DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL POSITIONS. FROM FOURTEEN TO TWENTY THREE WHICH IS A. SIXTY FOUR PERCENT INCREASE. BUT WHEN INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF MATTERS AND I TRUST SECTION CAN HANDLE BY ONLY EIGHT PERCENT. FOR A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS. OF WORK. WOULD ONLY BE A HUNDRED THIRTY WONDER POINT THREE PERCENT. FOLKS FORTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY HOURS TO FORTY THOUSAND THREE SEVENTY ONE. SO DOING THAT MATTHEW WOULD COST ABOUT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND. SOME OF OUR THIRTY THREE DOLLARS FOR EVERY EXTRA HOUR OF WORK. IT'S PRETTY BIG NUMBER. OUTSIDE KELSO WOULD BE. ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED OR OF TOGETHER SIX HUNDRED AND OUR. SO IN SHORT IT SEEMS LIKE. THE RETURN VERSE THE INVESTMENT. AS A PROBLEM. I'M NOT QUITE CERTAIN OF MATH BUT I IF I COULD GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. OF. BUT AT THE MOMENT EVERYONE IS VERY VERY MY MATH IS OFF THAT NO I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE MATHIS OFF BUT I'M SAYING THAT. WHAT WHAT THAT REFLECTS IS THAT WE ARE? OF WHERE. MY FOLKS ARE TOO THINLY STRETCHED OVER TOO MANY MATTERS RIGHT AT THE MOMENT. BY AND WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FULLER A CASE WE HAD SOMEONE DEVOTING HALF TIME. TO THE INVESTIGATION. WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND KIND OF RELYING ON THEM TO DO THE HEAVY LIFTING IF. IF. THE NEED OCCURRED. THEY WALKED AWAY SO ALL OF US AND SUDDENLY WE HAD TO GO TO COURT. VERY DRAMATICALLY AND WE HAD TO GO FROM A HALF A PERSON TO ABOUT TEN PEOPLE. TO PREPARE THE CASE WE FOUND SEVERAL OF THEM INTERNALLY WE PULL THEM AWAY% FROM OTHER. OTHER MATTERS LA BUT WE WENT OUTSIDE. FOR OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND THAT AND THAT RAN US TO ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND IT WAS A BURN RATE OF ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND A WEEK. WHILE IT WAS GOING ON. IF YOU CAN'T ALWAYS PREDICT. HOW THOSE THINGS WILL COME UP BUT I WILL SAY THAT HAD WE BEEN ABLE TO STAFF PROPERLY WHICH IS LET'S SAY TWO? ATTORNEYS OF FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE INVESTIGATION. WE STILL WOULD HAVE NEEDED MORE WHEN THE MOMENT CAME BUT WE WOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED AS MUCH MORE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN. WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO RELY IS HEAVILY ON THE FEDERAL ENFORCERS. FOR. FOR THE RESPONSE WHEN IT CAME. BY AND WE WE JUST GENERALLY WOULD HAVE HAD MORE A MORE VIABLE. ESSENTIALLY. MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR. A FOR MEETING THOSE KINDS OF CHALLENGES AND IT'S MORE AND MORE CLEAR. AYE IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES. SO IT'S GONNA BE A HEAVIER EMPHASIS ON THE CASES THAT WILL IN A NUMBER OF CASES GIVE US. MORE ATTORNEYS FEES. BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY WILL APPLY FOR ATTORNEYS FEES WHERE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS WAS THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE. AN INCREASE IN WORKLOAD THAT IS NOT SOME KIND OF THE MATCHING COMPARABLE TO THE REQUEST FOR. THE POSITIONS RIGHT IT DOUBLING YOUR STAFFING. GET YOU'RE NOT DOUBLING THE WORKLOAD AND SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A CONCERN THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. THAT ELLIOT WAS BROUGHT OUT IN A BIG MY MEMBER HERE WAS BRINGING OUT THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO. THING NAM ASSUMPTION IS THAT IF YOU IF YOU W. STAFF MOSTLY DOUBLING THE WORKLOAD UNLESS YOU'VE WORKED EXTREMELY UNDERSTAFFED AT THE BEGINNING. SO ALL THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE'D PROBABLY A LOT MORE CLARIFICATION ON AND IT YELLOWS RECOMMENDING THAT YOU GET NINE POSITIONS ISSUE AND INTO AN ASSESSMENT TWENTY TWENTY. WHICH IS A YEAR AFTER SEE IF THAT'S OKAY RATHER AN UPFRONT LOW TWENTY THREE OF HIS COMPOSITIONS. FOUGHT IN THE BUDGET THAT ATTACHED TO IT AND YET WOULD NOT SHOOT THAT REALLY WHAT IS WANTED BASED ON THE WORK CLOTHES THAT YOU YOU'VE IDENTIFIED WORKLOAD IT'S GOING TO INCREASE. BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF IT'S ON A DOUBLE BUT I'M NOT SURE AS YOU POINT OUT WHERE THE NOT THE CURRENT WORKLOADS ADEQUATE. OF BECAUSE THE ASSUMPTION OFTENTIMES IF THAT IF YOU'RE GETTING ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD THAT'S COMING IN THEN WILL FUND THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD. BUT IF IT HAS NOT BEEN COMPARABLE FROM THE BEGINNING VENUE NOT ONLY FUNDING THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD BUT YOU'RE FUNDING THE BACKLOG OF WORK THAT WAS NOT DONE. AND I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT THE LOGIC IS THAT THIS IT IT IS GIVING IN MIND THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE A PLAINTIFF SHOP FOR. SO IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE GONNA WORK WORK WE YOU WOULD RULE THE WHOLE THAT OPEN HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING. THE WORKLOAD AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE REQUEST. THIRD ITEM IS THE GAP BUREAU OF GAMBLING IN CONTROL. CHRIS RYAN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE POINT SIX MILLION FOR SPECIAL FUND. REQUESTING AN ARMY TATIAN FORGET FROM THE GAMBLING CONTROL FUND TO FUND TWELVE EXISTING POSITIONS. THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY GRANTED I'M AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. OKAY ANY COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM STAFF. DELEO. WE ARE RECOMMENDING EXTENDING THE FUNDING FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR RATHER THAN ON AN ONGOING BASIS IS PROPOSED. BEFORE YOU THIS WILL ALLOW DOJ TO CONTINUE TO WORK DOWN THE BACKLOG BUT WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR THE COLLECTION OF ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD DATA IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EAT. THE REASON WHY THIS ADDITIONAL DATA IS NEEDED. IS BECAUSE THE FULL IMPACT OF ALL THIRTY TO LIMITED TERM POSITIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED TO THE BUREAU TO WORK DOWN THE BACKLOG. IS UNCERTAIN AND WHEN I SEE THIRTY TWO IT'S THE TWELVE THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY AS WELL AS TWENTY THAT EXPIRE AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND SO THE WORKLOAD IS UNCERTAIN BECAUSE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS THE FIRST YEAR IN WHICH NEARLY ALL OF THE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS WILL BE STAFFED I MEAN THAT'S POINT ONE. LEADING THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT ANALYSTS AS THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND A BECOME MORE EXPERIENCED THEY SHOULD BECOME MORE PRODUCTIVE AND EFFICIENT OVERTIME. AND SO. HAVE NOT HAVING THIS INFORMATION ROOM MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ONGOING RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THE BUREAU TO AVOID A PERMANENT LARGE BACKLOG IN THE FUTURE. ANSWER DOJ IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATING THAT EACH OF ITS ANALYSTS ON AVERAGE WILL CLOSE OUT APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN CASES. IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN HOWEVER HISTORICALLY IT'S ANALYSTS HAVE ACTUALLY CLOSE OUT A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF CASES AND SO THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES CLOSED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SHOULD BE HIGHER POTENTIALLY BY SEVERAL HUNDRED. AND SO PROVIDING THE RESOURCES FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR AS WE RECOMMEND MEANS THAT ALL OF THE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS WILL EXPIRE AT THE SAME TIME AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. WITH THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD DATA YOU WOULD HAVE THAT AS PART OF YOUR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET DELIBERATIONS TO THEN DETERMINE WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ONGOING RESOURCES NEEDED IN THE FUTURE. WE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. IN A EL. FROM YES WITH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION IS. I APOLOGIZE I WAS IN ANOTHER HONORING CITING GET THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENTATION BUT. THE POSITION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE. KIND OF TEMPORARY RATE MOVING OUT BUT THERE FULL TIME. YES THERE ARE REQUESTED ARE THEY WERE LIMITED TERM. SINCE THEY WERE NOW ASKING BE MADE PERMANENT. SO WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM IN THE PAST WITH SOME OTHER DEPARTMENTS I THINK THEY WERE ACTUALLY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHERE. IS A SIMILAR SITUATION AND IT'S HARD TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING POSED BY OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES BECAUSE THAT IS A LEVEL OF CERTAINTY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND. THIS SITUATION IS KINDA MORE UP IN THE AIR AND WHEN YOU HAVE A. FAMILY ARE A FUTURE YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAY ME LIKE SOME CERTAIN TO GO ALONG WITH THAT AND I'M ASSUMING THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT HERE IS THAT IN ORDER TO. KEEP AYE THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE INVESTED THE THOSE WHO HAVE THE SKILLS SUCH ARE LOOKING FOR IN THE EXPERIENCE. YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEM IN THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO. CHYNA SOLIDIFY THEIR TO A PERMANENT POSITIONS AND SO THAT AND THAT WAS GONNA BE OUR. R. COMMENT RELATED TO THE LA A RECOMMENDATION IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO RECRUIT ON AN ON GOING OR TO HIRE PEOPLE AS YOU JUST DESCRIBED WHEN IT'S ONLY A ONE YEAR COMMITMENT. SO JUST MAKES A VERY CHALLENGING FOR US TO HIRE THOSE POSITIONS RIGHT NOW I GET IT OKAY THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THINKING MANAGER. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW IN THE AUDIENCE IN THE THOSE IN FAVOR THE RECOMMENDATION. ANYONE WHO POSTS. FAITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS ITEM TO WILL BE HELD OVER. IF YOU NUMBER FOUR WHICH IS A JUVENILE JUSTICE AND PROBATION STATISTICAL SYSTEM. SO AS WE UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A BRIEF. JUST OVERVIEW OF THE SYSTEM AND THEN I'LL PUT IT UP FOR SOME QUESTIONS RIGHT YEAH PLEASE. I AM ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE PROGRAM MANAGER AND FOR THE STATISTICS ON AT DOJ. PROPEL GOOD SECTION ONE THREE ZERO ONE. ZERO POINT BY THE DOJ IS MANDATED TO COLLECT DATA PERTAINING TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR CRIMINAL HISTORY AND STATISTICAL PURPOSES. THE JUVENILE COURT INFORMATION STATISTICAL SYSTEM AS THE PRIMARY SYSTEM STATEWIDE DATABASE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ON ALL JUVENILE PROBATION REFERRALS COURT ACTIONS AND FINAL DISPOSITIONS. THE SYSTEM COLLECTS AND COMPILES DATA ON THE NUMBER OF JUVENILES REFERRED TO THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT PURSUANT TO WELFARE INSTITUTION CODE SECTION SIX ZERO ONE. AND ARE SIX ZERO TWO. THE SYSTEM ALSO MAINTAINS DATA ON A DEFINED UNIVERSE OF DATA ELEMENTS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL JUVENILE WHOSE IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IS ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM. COUNTIES MUST SUBMIT DATA INTO THE GC PSS ON A MONTHLY BASIS. EITHER IN MANUAL DATA ENTRY OR THROUGH THE WEB ENABLED UPLOADING PROCESS COUNTIES THE ENTER DATA MANUALLY VIA THE WEB ENABLED APPLICATION. MAY ENTER IT THROUGHOUT THE MONTH AND COUNTIES THAT SUBMIT DATA VIA THE UPLOAD PROCESS MUST SUBMIT THE DATA BY THE TENTH WORKING DAY OF THE FOLLOWING REPORTING PERIOD. THERE IS A WIDE FIRE WIDE VARIATION IN THE WAY THE COUNTIES. COMPLY WITH THE DAISY PS AS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS MOST LIKELY DEPENDENT UPON THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE LOCAL DATA SYSTEMS. THE JUVENILE JUSTICE DATA WORKING GROUP HAS ESTABLISHED WAS ESTABLISHED TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ON THE MUST BILL AND TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH REPORTED ON FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AIMED AT. OPTIONS FOR IMPROVING INTER AGENCY COORDINATION MODERNIZATION AND UPGRADING OF STATE AND LOCAL JUVENILE JUSTICE DATA AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AMONG THE FINDINGS THE REPORT STATES THAT COMPREHENSIVE OUTCOME DATA INCLUDING RECIDIVISM IS NOT CURRENTLY TRACKED AND MAY NOT BE TRACKABLE THROUGH THE JP JC PSS SYSTEM. BECAUSE THE DATA BILLS IS BILL ON OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY. THE REPORTED THE REPORT CITED ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS OF THE DECSS INCLUDING THE UNAVAILABILITY OF DATA RELATED TO ADULT COURT DISPOSITIONS. PLACEMENT OUTCOMES BY THE TYPE OF FACILITY AND WELLNESS OUTCOMES INCLUDING EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE STATUS. OKAY THANK YOU ANY ANY QUESTIONS. YES MISTER STONE. SO CLEARLY WOULD BE HAVE AN OUTDATED SYSTEM AND PART OF THIS REQUEST REALLY COMES THROUGH ME. BECAUSE I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THE IN DATA AND DATA COLLECTION. AND BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND AND TRACK SPECIALLY JUVENILES WHO THE PROCESS THEN AS THEY GO INTO THE ADULT PROCESS THAT WE HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF RECIDIVISM SO WE REALLY. KNOW WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WHAT THE LAY OF THE LAND AS. SO PART OF THE QUESTION IS HOW INTERESTED ARE YOU IN UPDATING THE SYSTEM WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO UPDATE THE SYSTEM HOW DO WE START TO GET. THE DATA THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED ULTIMATELY TO TO REALLY DO THE POLICY THAT WE NEED. WE'VE BEEN. MOVING FOR POLICY AND RECORD CEILING WE'VE BEEN MOVING FOR POLICY ON PROTECTING YOU THINK GIVING THEM A SECOND CHANCE ON. REALLY LOOKING AT THE OVERALL CONNECTIONS TO THE SYSTEMS. THE DATA IS KIND OF. THE DATE IS LACKING SO HOW DO WE GET FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW TO A SYSTEM WHERE WE HAVE. ADEQUATE DATA TO BE ABLE TO KNOW THE POLICY WE'RE DOING IS WORKING AND START TO EXPAND THAT POLICY FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR KIDS. I DEFINITELY THINK IT'S A WHERE THE DISCUSSION TO HAVE BUT I THINK WE'RE NOT THE ONLY PARTNER INVOLVED IN IN THIS PROCESS. I THINK NGUYEN JCPS WAS INITIALLY ESTABLISHED IT WAS PURELY FOR STATISTICAL PURPOSES AND IT REALLY DOESN'T TRACK A JUVENILE THROUGH THE SYSTEM IS TALKING A REFERRAL THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT REFERRAL. AND SO YOU MIGHT HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL IN THERE ARE MULTIPLE TIMES IF THEY HAVE MULTIPLE REFERRALS AND SO TO BE CHANGING THE WHOLE BASIS AND FOUNDATION I THINK THE UNIT OF MEASUREMENT. OF THE SYSTEM SO THAT WOULD THAT REQUIRES SOME. FURTHER DISCUSSION I THINK WITH WITH MANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED. AND THAT IS A THRESHOLD QUESTION IS HOW INTERESTED IS DOJ AND. IN PURSUING THIS IF WE WERE TO START TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND REALLY LOOK AT. THE THAT THE DATA COLLECTION AND AND HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ROBUST AND ALL THAT UNFUNDED. RIGHT AND THAT'S HOW IT INDICATE WAS I NOT HER DID YOU EARLIER RIGHT YEAH. YEAH NON UNDERSTANDING THAT WERE THE TIME WELL WORTH IT FOR US. TO INVEST IN IN IN IN A SOLID DATA SYSTEM IF WE CAN GET THERE NOW THE CAT GOT IS WE'VE HAD LOTS OF OTHER DATA SYSTEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN. EMBARKED ON THAT HAVE BEEN COLOSSAL FAILURES AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THROWN DOWN THE DRAIN SO. FIRST THING WE NEED TO KNOW IS THE WILLINGNESS. WILLINGNESS OF OF THE PARTNERS TO TO GO GET THE STATE I THINK I THINK THAT IT'S NEED I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT. THAT HOW WE PUT TOGETHER MAKE SURE WE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE DATA SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND FUNDS. THEIR THEIR CREATION OF OF THE SYSTEM BUT. WE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE WE HAVE. STAY CLOSE RIGHT EVERYBODY REALLY WILLING TO IT DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKS SO THAT WE CAN TRACK. PEOPLE THROUGH THAT TO THE PROGRAM. SO I AS I INDICATED EARLIER I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT IT YEAH I WOULD JUST CAUTION YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE CAN COMMIT VERSUS HOW MUCH WERE FUNDED TO DO BUT IT'S THAT CONVERSATION WOULD BE WILLING TO HAVE. A WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN AND IS ILL ALISON INDICATED THERE ARE OTHER PARTIES. AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT WOULD NEED TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION AND MUCH OF THE DATA RESIDES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL RIGHT RIGHT. AND SO HAVING A STATEWIDE SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING THAT CREATES OTHER FISCAL ISSUES. FOR THE LOCALS AS WELL. SO I THINK IT'S IT'S STEP BY CONVERSATION WE CAN HAPPEN AND AS YOU INDICATE SAW EARLIER AT THE AGE IS VERY INTERESTED IN AND MANY THINGS BUT AGAIN. WE CAUTION HOW MUCH. WE CAN COMMIT GIVEN YOU KNOW THE FUNDING RESOURCES WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING. NO I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I'M NOT ASKING. TO. THEY EXPEND MONEY NOW TO SOLVE A PROBLEM I WOULD TRY TO DEFINE THE PROBLEM MAKE SURE LEADING WE KNOW WHAT'S. POTENTIALLY WHAT'S NEED BUT HOW WE DESIGN IT AND HAVE A STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT'S KIND OF TOP DOWN. DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK I THINK WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES WERE WHO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. FUNNY WHAT THEY DO HAVE AND CAN DO AND THEN INSURE THAT THAT THERE'S A WAY FOR THAT DATA THEN TO GET COLLECTED UP SO THAT WE CAN START TO. ASK THOSE QUESTIONS. BUT THERE IS A STATE INTEREST IN THIS BECAUSE OF THE THERE ARE A LOT OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND. JUVENILES TEND TO MOVE COUNTY TO COUNTY DIFFER PROGRAM SPECIAL IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM NOW EVEN JUST INVOLVED JUSTICE. I'VE BEEN TALKING TO A NUMBER OF PROBATION OFFICES AND SWITCHING SOME OF THE SMALLER COUNTIES LOOKING IT REGIONAL RESOURCES TO HELP. HELP THEM SOLVE SOME ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE IS SOMETHING THAT A NUMBER OF THEM ARE INTERESTED AND. SO IN THIS BROADER CONVERSATION HAVING BAD DATA TO KNOW WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND AND THAT'S WHAT NEXT ERECTIONS ARE. IT'S IT'S GONNA BE ULTIMATELY VERY IMPORTANT. UNDERSTOOD. CAN IT IN THE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW. THIS. O'DONNELL PUBLIC COMMENTS ARE YOU IN FAVOR OPPOSED. IN FAVOR DIRECTIONS. OH OKAY ONE IN FAVOR. I CAN HEAR YOU I'M ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE ON THE HIGHEST IN START. AND I SERVICES STATE LAST YEAR JUVENILE JUSTICE DATA WORKING GROUP THAT WAS CREATED BY THIS LEGISLATURE BACK IN AND TWENTY FOURTEEN. WE ARE ISSUED. ALIKE TO HEAR SEVENTY PAGES OF REPORT. OF LOOKING COMPREHENSIVELY AT A JC PSS THE ITEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY AND ALL NEEDS A ACROSS THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR PERFORMANCE OUTCOME MEASURES FOR PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. AND JUST FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE DATA SYSTEM ITSELF. OUR NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION WAS TO REPAIR THE BROKEN JUVENILE COURT AND I AM PREVENTION STATISTICAL SYSTEM. AND I COULD TAKE UP MORE TIME GOING THROUGH A LITANY OF WHAT'S WRONG. ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS THAT'S MISSING IS WE HAVE NO CAPACITY. IN CALIFORNIA. THROUGH THIS STATEWIDE DATABASE TO COLLECT RECIDIVISM DATA ON CHILDREN MOVING THROUGH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THAT'S REALLY. THE GOLD STANDARD IS THE BEST PRACTICE STANDARDS. VETS BACKED. BY A NATIONAL ONE AGENCIES THE COUNCIL OF STATE GOVERNMENTS. THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUST. WE NOTED ALSO IN OUR REPORT THAT. IN OTHER YOUTH SERVING ROAMS. WE HAVE MADE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN UPGRADING THE SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT THE POLICY CHANGES WE MAKE. ON THE CW S. CMS ARE CHILD WELFARE DATA SYSTEM AT ALL UC BERKELEY. THE CAL PADS. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE EDUCATION DATA NETWORK NO INVESTMENT FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS HAS BEEN MADE. IN UPGRADING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE DATA SYSTEM THE STATE MAINTAINS AT DOJ. NOTHING IN MEANWHILE THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS MOVING. INTO A TRANSFORMATIONAL MODE WERE CHANGING THE BOUNDARIES OF THE SYSTEM OR ADDING NEW PROGRAMS AND WE HAVEN'T GOT THE CAPACITY WE NEED. TO ANALYZE THEM SO OUR HOPE IS THAT WHAT WILL COME OUT OF THIS PROCESS. IS A DIRECTIVE OR A REQUIREMENT. THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WOULD COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF A PLAN. WITHIN THE SCOPE OF PERHAPS A YEAR BY NEXT MARCH. FOR WHAT IT WOULD TAKE ONE OF THE OPTIONS FOR UPGRADING. JCPS US SO WE CAN HAVE THE CAPACITY WE NEED TO ANALYZE THE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES WE'RE GOING FORWARD WITH SO. THERE'S A SPIRIT OF WORKING TOGETHER HERE. TO MEMBERS OF THE JUPITER. WHEN. I'M DONE. SO THAT'S IT SO WE'RE JUST HOPING NOT FOR AN APPROPRIATION BUT FOR. FORWARD MOVEMENT ON A PLAN THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER. A FAVOR ALL BE BRIEF MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHEAPER PATIENT OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA. WERE CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO DOT DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING AND WOULD VERY MUCH WANT TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATIONS WITH AYE THIS COMMITTEE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE WITH DOJ ARE OUR PARTNERS ON MR STEINHARDT AND OTHERS. WITH THAT THE SYSTEM CERTAINLY IS. OUTDATED AND IN NEED OF SOME REVISIONS BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT PIECE WILL BE. LOOKING AT WHAT WE NEED OR WE GO TO THE NEXT PHASE AS DEFINING THE MOST MEANINGFUL DATA NOT JUST NECESSARILY BUILDING UPON WHAT CURRENTLY IS BUT RECOGNIZING THAT THE STRUCTURE THAT. THE VARIABLES THAT ARE ARE IN THE SYSTEM LOOK DIFFERENT NOW AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE COLLECTING THE RIGHT KIND OF DATA. FROM BOTH THE POLICY PERSPECTIVE AND FROM IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE PARTIES TOWARDS ADEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL FOR. DISCUSSING ITEM WE'VE WE RECEIVED A NUMBER OF LEVELS LETTERS FROM DIFFERENT AGENCIES AS WELL. AT ALL SAYING PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING THAT WE NEED TO UPDATE OUR A DATA SYSTEM. THAT WE ARE WE EXPENDED OFF A LOT OF MONEY AND JUVENILE JUSTICE IN THE STATE YET WE'RE NOT SURE WHETHER THAT'S AFFECTED. BECAUSE OF WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA IN TERMS OF RECIDIVISM THE MONEY THAT WAS SPINNING IS IS WE'RE NOT SURE WE'RE DOING IT AND EVERYTHING BECOMES. ANECDOTAL INFORMATION ABOUT A CHILD WHO DID WHATEVER BUT IT MAY NOT BE THE NORM AND SO FOR CLEARLY WE NEED TO DO THIS. IT'S NICE THAT WE ARE BEING OFFERED TO WORK WITH IT INDIVIDUALS AND IT WAS A STONE IS INTERESTED IN IT. AND BUT WHAT IF SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO DO THAT ONLY HERE BUT WE ASKING FOR IT ALSO AND OTHER AGENCIES AS WELL. OUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING IN TERMS OF WHICH CHANGING POLICIES AND DOING THINGS AND WE ABILITY ASIAN THAT IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING. AND THAT WENT SOMETHING IS WORKING WE NEED TO EXPAND ON IT AND WHAT IS NOT WORKING WE NEED TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE KNOW THAT WILL WORK. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT ITEM FOUR IS HELD OVER THAT SEAT A JUVENILE JUSTICE. DATA INFORMATION WILL NOT ITEM NUMBER FIVE WHICH IS A CALIFORNIA CADET CORPS EXPANSION. THANK YOU ALL. TWO ITEMS HERE. OKAY. GREAT. SO WE BEGIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CADET CORPS EXPANSION. MADAM CHAIR I'M DAVE BALLROOM WITH THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT. THIS ITEM OF PROPOSED A SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND TWELVE R. P. Y.. TO. IN AN EFFORT THAT GOES OVER SEVERAL YEARS THAT WILL. RAPIDLY EXPAND DRAMATICALLY EXPAND THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA CADET CORS. COVERING CAN ACCORDS BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN ELEVEN IT WAS. FORMED AT THE TIME BY THE MY PREDECESSOR GENERAL EDWIN FORBES WE SAW THE WINDS OF WORLD WAR ONE COMING AND KNEW THAT. AMERICA WAS GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT ROLE ON THE GLOBAL STAGE AND HE DIDN'T FEEL THAT THE YOUTH OF CALIFORNIA REPORT PREPARED. TO BE THE BUSINESS LEADERS THE ACADEMIC LEADERS ON THE LTIR LEADERS. THAT TIME TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT SO YOU FORMED A PROGRAM THAT PRIDE MILITARY TRAINING MILITARY DISCIPLINE TO AUGMENT ACT ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE WITH IN HIGH SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY WE HAVE A FIFTY FIVE SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM WITH SIX THOUSAND CADETS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE. HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO SERVICE ABOUT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND CADETS STATEWIDE? THE PROGRAM PRODUCES SOME PRETTY IMPRESSIVE RESULTS. IF A CHILD OR STUDENT IS ENROLLED IN THE CALIFORNIA KEPT CONNECT OR THEIR NINETY PERCENT LIKELY TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL ON TIME. AS OPPOSED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGE OF EIGHTY PERCENT. MORE POORLY THERE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO GET INTO COLLEGE. SO WE'VE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A VERY VERY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. THE MONEY THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR WOULD FIND STATEWIDE SERVICES AND PEOPLE THAT FROM THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT. THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME TRAINING CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND STATEWIDE SUPPORT TO THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY SPENDING LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING. TO HIRE THE. CADRE OF THE MULTI FACULTY AT EACH OF THE SCHOOLS APART BATES. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. WHAT WE HEAR FROM OUR VILLAGE? UNIFORM BUT. JOSH DUGGAR DEPARTMENT FINANCE. WHICH IS. ECHO THE THE WORDS FROM THE CALIFORNIA MILITA PARCHMENT THAT. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AND WORTH THE INVESTMENT IN THAT THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BEING PROVIDED WILL HELP PROVIDE A UNIFORM EXPERIENCE ACROSS ALL SCHOOLS THE. EXISTING SCHOOLS. AS WELL AS THOSE BEING EATEN UP PART OF THE EXPANSION. YEAH FELLOW. A AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS RUN LET US WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. BOB WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FEDERAL FUND. APPROPRIATIONS TO EXPAND THE CADET CORPS BECAUSE IT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL APPROACH OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMER HEALTHY FF. FOR SUPPORTING EDUCATIONAL ENRICHMENT INVESTMENTS WE ALSO CONTINUE TO SEE ISSUES. WITH THE BUDGET REQUEST DETAILS JUSTIFYING FEE. ACTUAL LEVEL OF A REQUESTED FUNDING. ARE WE FIND THAT THE CURRENT LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA MODEL. DOES ENABLED SCHOOLS WITH THE AUTONOMY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO FIND. THE CAT CORPS PROGRAMS THEMSELVES THE IN ACCORDANCE WITH. ALL THEIR VALUE TO THOSE SCHOOLS ARE RELATIVE TO OTHER. AVAILABLE EDUCATIONAL THAT SMITH'S ARE THE CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS DALLAS AND TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN I MOVED THE STATE FUNDING FOR PRIMARY EDUCATION AWAY FROM CATEGORICAL FUNDING. ULTRABASE PER PUPIL FUNDING MODEL. WITH ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION FUNDING FOR ENGLISH LEARNER AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS AYE TO THE EXTENT THAT. THESE. OR THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME CATEGORICAL FUNDING OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS BY THE STATE. OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE RELATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER. AND. HAVE A MUCH SMALLER FUNDING AMOUNTS. AND RECEIVE THEIR ALLOCATIONS FROM THE PROBLEM ANY EIGHT. CARVE OUT. OF LOGIC JOURNAL FUND RATHER DIRECTLY FROM THE GENERAL FUND. A PRIMARY RATIONALE FOR THIS MODEL A WAS TO PROVIDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY. TO SPEND RESOURCES ON LOCAL PRIORITIES AT LEVEL THAT THEY SEE FIT. RATHER AT THE DIRECTION OF THE STATE. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY HOW THE CURRENT FIFTY ONE PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS CURRENTLY FUND THEIR PROGRAMS. I WE KNOW THAT IF A SCHOOLS FIND THIS PROGRAM JULIE BECAUSE THEY STUDENTS TO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED ADVOCATES WILL OUTCOMES THEY SHOULD BE WILLING TO PRIORITIZE THAT THEIR CURRENT FUNDING FOR IT JUST AS THEY WOULD ANY OTHER. POTENTIAL ENRICHMENT PROGRAM THAT THEY HAVE. JUST LET ME KNOW THAT THE LOCAL I. CONTROL FUNDING. FORMULA. I'VE FUNDING HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY FOR SCHOOLS IN RECENT YEARS. LA FINALLY WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE BUDGET REQUEST DETAILS SUBMITTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION COULD TO HAVE A NUMBER OF ISSUES IN SOME CASES. THEY'RE STILL IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL. THAT WE WERE PROVIDED SUCH AS THE LOCAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL STATE LEVEL STAFF. I KNOW CASES IT WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH. THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF RESOURCES REQUESTED AYE AS IS THE CASE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S REQUEST FOR EXAMPLE FOR. THE FUND BY PERCENT THE COST OF THE FULL. UNIFORM SET FOR EVERY YEAR FOR EVERY CADET CORPS COMMANDANT. WHETHER TO NOT THEY ARE NEWLY RECRUITED OR. I RETAIN FROM PREVIOUS YEARS. MORE OVER THE MUCH OF THE REQUESTED RESOURCES ARE BASED ON VERY AGGRESSIVE MULTI YEAR PROGRAM. THE EXPANSION PROJECTIONS WHICH MAY NOT BE REALIZED YOU THEREFORE DO NOT BELIEVE. THAT A MULTI YEAR REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES EVEN FROM BUDGET ITEMS THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY SUPPORTED BY THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT IS A AT THIS TIME WARRANTED UNTIL. THE CADET CORPS CAN. DEMONSTRATE ITS ACTUAL RATE OF EXPANSION. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ISSUES MELINDA. THINK MADAM CHAIR. IS SO. YOU SAID THAT HE CALIFORNIA CADET CORPS KINDA CAME ON THE HEELS OF THE WAR RIGHT. HOW MANY OF YOU ARE CAN DEBTS GO ON? TO MILITARY SERVICE ONCE I GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. SH SO WE DON'T WE DON'T TRACK THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM JUNIOR OUR TO SEE WHICH IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM IS. DESIGNED TO INCULCATE MILITARY IDEAS INTO KIDS STICK WITH THE GOAL OF GET YOUR HAVING THEM JOIN ONE OF THE SERVICES. ARSES PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT SO THEY CAN BECOME. BETTER CITIZENS AND BETTER LEADERS LEADERS IN WHATEVER. PATH THEY CHOOSE TO FALL. SO IS IT LIKE GOD I AM YOU FORGIVE ME I'M JUST I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROGRAM I HAVE FIVE KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL I NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROGRAM SO IT'S. OUR SCHOOLS ARE ONE OF THE FIFTY FIVE THAT YOU'RE IN. IS THIS LIKE JROTC ARE THEY WEARING UNIFORMS EVERYDAY TO CHARITIES WHO WAS MODELED AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CONNECT OR. OF THOSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S OF VALUE WHAT WE WERE DOING IN CALIFORNIA AT SOME POINT. IN THE FIFTIES OR SIXTIES AND ADOPTED THAT THAT SAME CREDIT PROGRAM BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING GEARED TOWARD. MILITARY SERVICE IT IS A MILITARY ENVIRONMENT SO THE KIDS WILL COME IN AND DEPENDING ON THE SCHOOL WEAR THE UNIFORM EITHER ONE DAY WAKE WHEN SOME SCHOOLS THEY WEAR UNIFORMS. ALL THE TIME. AND. AND SELECTIVE CLASS SO INSTEAD OF TAKING BAND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU TO CALIFORNIA TECH WAR WHERE THE TEACH LEADERSHIP TO TEACH PLAN NAVIGATION. SOME MILITARY SCIENCE THEY DO ENCAMPMENTS THEY DO DRILL COMPETITIONS. IS THIS FOR. IS THIS FOR KIDS WHO ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY IN SCHOOL OR IS THIS FOR KIDS WHO ARE. THE HYATT CHEEVER'S ANYONE IN IN ANY OF THE SCHOOLS THAT THERE'S A ROLE ANY ANY KID CAN PARTICIPATE. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OF QUESTIONS. ANY PRO FROM THE AUDIENCE YES. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MY NAME IS SET TO READ. A BRIEF STATEMENT THAT'S NOW THAT YOU'RE IN FAVOR OF IT OR NOT YES YES MY NAME IS SET THREE WITH THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. HA BEHALF OF OUR CLIENTS AMERICAN LEGION DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA'S AMVETS DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE OFFICERS CALIFORNIA STATE COMMANDERS VETERANS COUNCIL MILITARY OFFICES SOCIALIZATION. OF AMERICA CALIFORNIA COUNCIL CHAPTERS VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL AND NATIONAL GUARD SOCIALIZATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU. ANY ANYONE IN ANY OPPOSITION ANYONE OPPOSED. OKAY ANY OF THE BOOK THANK YOU FOR THE UP PRESENTATION WILL LOOK OVER I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS. AND AND HAS SOME VALIDITY IS THAT. WE HAVE. I GUESS THE OTHER IN THE FIFTY ONE SCHOOLS OF IT YOU HAVE A BECAUSE FIFTY ONE FIFTY FIVE. SCHOOLS YOU HAVE ARE BASICALLY FUNDED THROUGH LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IS THAT CORRECT THAT BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE ABOUT WE HAVE ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDES THE. STATEWIDE OVERSIGHT AND WET WITH THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL WOULD. I'M UNABLE US TO DO IS TO EXPAND THAT TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TRAINING AND CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT TO. OVER THREE TIMES MORE SCHOOLS WHICH CONTINUES SIR COULD SERVICE NOW THE PROBLEM WITH LCC OFFICE IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO USE LCD FF NOR IS THERE EVEN A MECHANISM. TO BE ABLE TO WORK THAT BACKWARDS TO DEVELOP STATEWIDE PROGRAMS. SO THIS ENABLES THE STATE TO HAVE CONTINUITY THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMS WE CAN HAVE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAMS AND WE CAN HAVE EFFICIENCIES AND. UNIFORM PURCHASES BECAUSE WE CAN BUY UNIFORMS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND MASS OTHER LESS EXPENSIVE THAN IF THE SCHOOL HAD TO RUN OUT. AND RUN ITS OWN SO IN ORDER TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE. UNIFIED PROGRAM STATEWIDE WAS STATEWIDE STANDARDS IT REQUIRES A STATEWIDE INVESTMENT. SO. IN ADDITION TO. JUST BASICALLY MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HAVE OVERSIGHT YOU ALSO WAS TALKING ABOUT BUYING UNIFORMS AND EVERYTHING ALSO DRIVES A PROGRAM. THE UNIVERSE CURRENTLY A PAID FOR BY WHOM THE SCHOOL SITES ARE CURRENTLY PAID FOR BY THE STATE ABOUT THE STATE OKAY THAT'S OUT OF THE ONE POINT. FIVE MILLION ONE POINT. ONE BY THINGS ONE POINT ONE MILLION AT. ANY RATE THE IT IS INADEQUATE WE. WE CAN'T KEEP UP EVEN WITH THE DEMAND FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. OKAY PRIMARY. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY OF THAT ITEM WILL BE HELD OVER IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THINK WE NEEDED TO SEEK. OUT ONE OF THE LEGACIES OF THE THEM CHALLENGES THAT WERE ASKING ME ASKED TO UP. YOU KNOW TO DO MORE AND AND AND OBVIOUSLY SET UP THESE CATEGORICAL FUNDING IS THAT THIS THAT OF THE SCHOOLS HAVE AGREED THEY WOULDN'T DO. BECAUSE THEY WOULD RELY ON LC AFFAIR SAYS REALLY COMPLICATED SAME THING WITH FELLOW KRETEK EDUCATION. AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WITH THEIR THAT SHOULD BE COVERED IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULAS. SO WILL LOOK AT THIS AND SAY BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ITEM NUMBER SIX IS TO ESTABLISH A MILITARY DEPARTMENT I THINK THIS WAS AS WELL. PRESENCE AT THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY INSTITUTE AND PORTABLE MILITARY. WITH THIS. PER REQUEST WOULD DO IS ENABLE US TO EXPAND THE MODEL THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT THE LOCAL MILITARY INSTITUTE OVER SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO. FOR A. FOR A SCHOOL THE CHARTER SCHOOL THAT FOCUSES ON HIGH PERFORMING KIDS. AND DISADVANTAGED AREAS ARE DISTRICTS FOR KIDS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE AVAILABLE OR OR HELP HAVE THE RESOURCES. AT HOME OR IN SCHOOL TO BECOME COMPETITIVE TO GET INTO COLLEGE AND WE DO THAT AT THE LOCAL MILITARY INSTITUTE. THIS WOULD EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO A. PORTABLE THAT STARTED ADDITIONAL SCHOOL IN PORTERVILLE AND THEN ONE IN RIVERSIDE. OKAY THE ARM THE REQUEST IS FOR THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY ONE P. WHY IN THE. IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN THAT WILL ON. THE A STEADY STATE OF THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT ENABLES US TO PUT CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT CADRE. MOSTLY CALIFORNIA ACTUAL GUARD SOLDIERS OR AIRMEN THAT TEACH THE. LEADERSHIP CLASSES IN THESE. IN THE SCHOOLS AND ALSO ASSIST WITH I'M RUNNING THE SCHOOL IN THE GOOD ORDER AND DISCIPLINE IN THE SCHOOL. THE RESULTS OF THE LOCAL MILITARY AN INSTITUTE OR EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THOSE OF THE CADET CORPS. IF A STUDENT ENROLLS IN THE OPEN MILITARY INSTITUTE THERE NINETY SIX PERCENT. FROM LIKELY TO GRADUATE ON TIME AND EVERYONE THE GRADUATES COMPLETES OUR AGE THROUGH G.. REQUIREMENTS. LAST YEAR'S GRADUATING CLASS OF ABOUT EIGHTY KIDS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE KIDS GRADUATED THAT WENT THROUGH. OF THOSE ALL% BUT FIVE WHEN ON TO EITHER TO YOUR FOR YOUR CIVILIAN SCHOOLS OF THE REMAINING FIVE THREE WENT TO ONE OF OUR SERVICE ACADEMIES. AND TO ENLIST IN THE MILITARY SO IT IS IT IS VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THIS REQUEST IS FOR US TO ESTABLISH CHARTER SCHOOLS. WHICH IS KIND OF UNUSUAL. SO THE THAT WE WILL PARTNER WITH. CHARTER SCHOOLS IN EACH OF THOSE DISTRICTS AND THEN. THE THE MILITARY PART WHEN THE STATE PROVIDES THE. MELTER SUPPORT TO THOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS SO THERE WILL BE A SCHOOL BOARD AND A SEVEN EIGHT THEN THERE'LL BE SPONSORED CHARTER SCHOOLS OF EACH OF THE DISTRICTS WHETHER IT'S IMPORTANT BILL. OR THE ONE AND. IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. NOW THE CURRENT FACILITY IN OAKLAND AS SOON. IS IS THE IS THAT THAT THAT'S WAS THE CHARTER SCHOOL IN OAKLAND THAT'S GREAT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL IS MILITARY. OF ALL SCHOOLS METRICS TO AND SO ARE YOU SEEKING TO CREATE CHARTER SCHOOLS THE WHOLE SCHOOL MILITARY SCHOOLS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS THAT IT. SO IT IS ON THIS IS A VERY UNUSUAL REQUEST FOR US TO GET INVOLVED IN CHARTER SCHOOL FUNDING OR CHARTER SCHOOL. CREATION OF CHARTER SCHOOLS BECAUSE NOT ONLY THEIR THEIR THEIR EXISTENCE IS DRIVEN BY ABA AND THE RESOURCES THAT COME WITH IT AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS. AND APPROVAL BY THE SCHOOL BOARD FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS ALL THAT WILL HAPPEN THESE WILL THESE WILL BE CHARTER SCHOOLS. THAT ARE FORMED AND FUNDED THREE EIGHTY A EIGHTY A WILL BE SPONSORED BY THE. BY THE SCHOOL. THE DISTRICTS IN WHICH THEY RESIDE THEY WILL HAVE A I'M SCHOOL BOARD JUST LIKE A CHARTER SCHOOL WITH THE CIVILIAN SUPERINTENDENT. AND ALL OF THEIR FUNDING MODELS WILL BE A PRE MUCH IDENTICAL TO ANY OTHER CHARTER SCHOOL IN THE STATE WITH THE EXCEPTION. OF THE MILITARY COMPONENT THE STATE FUNDS THAT ENABLES THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT TO COME AND TO PROVIDE THAT. THOSE EXTRA PERSONNEL TO TEACH THE LEADERS OF CHARACTER CLASS TO HELP IMPROVE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. OKAY NOW WHO PUT WHO DOES THAT WITH THE OPEN CHARTER SCHOOL AYE SO MAY HAVE FOLKS TO COME IN FROM THE MILITARY WE DO WE HAVE. WE HAVE SIXTEEN PERSONNEL. ON THAT ARE CURRENTLY WORKING THERE ARE FULL TIME STATE ACTIVE DUTY FROM THE CALIFORNIA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD AND AIR NATIONAL GUARD. THAT WORKS. IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL SO WE HAVE A COMMANDANT THAT'S NATIONAL GUARD MEMBER BUT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SCHOOL THE TWO PRINCIPALS AT THE SCHOOL. AND. ALL OF THE TEACHERS ARE CIVILIANS THAT ARE EMPLOYEES OF THAT CHARTER. HE COMES FROM FINANCE BELIAU US THE U. PERCHED READY TO GO. BUT WE RECOMMEND. THE LET'S SAY TO REJECT. THIS PROPOSAL. FOR THE MULTI DEPARTMENT SUPPORT THESE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL ACADEMY AS A PERSONAL PORTABLE. OF BECAUSE AS WITH THE CADET CORPS THE MILITARY CAN MEANWHILE IS UNCERTAIN TO PRODUCE SIGNIFICANTLY. BENEFICIAL EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OVERALL RELATIVE TO OTHER AVAILABLE FROM INVESTMENTS AND IT IS THEREFORE CLEAR WHAT'S PROGRAMS THAT SERVE. SPECIAL TREATMENT FROM THE STATE COMPARED TO OTHER PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED THROUGH. HEALTHY FF UP FOR THE EXIT MISTRESS OF THE RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSAL IS TO REPLICATE THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOME RESULTS FROM THE OAKLAND MILITARY INSTITUTE. HOWEVER DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THE SO SOME WITH MIXED RESULTS IN THIS REGARD FOR EXAMPLE WHILE. ARE THE OAKLAND INSTITUTE DOES NOT PERFORM THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SOME MEASURES. THERE'S A TENDENCY GRADUATION RATES IN OTHER AREAS SUCH AS ENGLISH AND MATH SCORES AND SUSPENSE RATES ARE THE INSTITUTE IS EITHER ON PAR WITH A DISTRICT AS A WHOLE OR IN SOME CASES DOES WORSE DESPITE. SIMILAR STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS TO THE DISTRICT. ARE WE FOR THE FIND THAT. THE LCF AMP MODEL. DOES ALLOW PERSON PORTABLE TO DIRECTLY FROM THESE ACADEMIES AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED. THE MILE DID LIVE THE STATE AWAY FROM. MECHANICAL GOAL FUNDING TO BASE FOR PEOPLE FUNDING. AND AT THIS IS IN FACT HOW ALL OF THE OTHER. MILITARY THEMED CHARTER ACADEMY IS OTHER THAN OAKLAND ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED. JUST WE WOULD NOTE THAT. IN ADDITION TO HIGHER BASE. PER PUPIL FUNDING FOR. THESE PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICT SINCE THEY HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF IN WHISTLER AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS THEY ALSO GETTING A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE. IN RECENT YEARS FROM. THE SUPPLEMENTAL ACOSTA TREASON FUNDING. FOR. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. OKAY WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS CAREFULLY IT IT'S A VERY UNUSUAL REQUEST TO HAVE US. GET INVOLVED IN AUTHORIZING CHARTER SCHOOLS I THINK WE. AND THAT'S SUCH A HYDRA KILEY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE HERE IT THAT AT THE STATE AS THOSE RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD BE TO AUTHORIZE A CHARTER SINCE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ESTABLISHING. WHAT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE ADDITIONAL CHARTER IS A SOMETHING OF WHAT IS IT? I MEAN TO THE JUST TWO MORE. OKAY SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CREATING TO WHICH ARTIST. OF THE CURRENT CHARTER FOR THE OAKLAND WANT IS IS CHARTED THROUGH WHAT THE SCHOOL BOARD THROUGH ITS THROUGH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OKAY ALL THREE OF THESE WOULD BE LOCAL CHARTERS. SPONSORED BY THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT SO THEY'RE NOT STATE LEVEL CHARTERS OKAY. SO THEY'RE OKAY BUT. YES. I HAVE NO IDEA. I HAVE YEAH HAVE YOU MADE A REQUEST TO FOR THE CHARTER SO YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS. SO THE SO BOTH OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SEVEN APPROACH THE MOTOR DEPARTMENT. AND SAID THAT THEY INTEND TO FORM CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO ADOPT MODEL. AT OPEN MILITARY INSTITUTE AND THEY ASKED US TO WORK WITH THEM TO SO THIS IS THAT WE'RE HEARING THAT QUARTER BILL THAT'S CORRECT OKAY THOSE TO. US SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE REQUIRED ARM ARE EXAMINING CHARTERS OKAY AND SO AND THEY WANT TO USE THAT MODEL. AND THEY WANT US TO FIND. A PORTION OF IT IS THAT RIGHT. OKAY. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF REQUEST THANK YOU ALRIGHT THAT I WILL BE HELD OPEN THIS WELL. I WOULD ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN. WHICH IS A CALIFORNIA EARLY EARTHQUAKE WARNING SYSTEM. AND ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT I THINK BECAUSE A NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM OKAY. YES. CALIFORNIA EARLY WARNING EARTHQUAKE WARNING SYSTEMS. IF YOU GET BEGIN. SEC. TOUGHEST OUT ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FOR THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. ALL INTRODUCED THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY MORNING PROPOSAL. WHERE REQUEST DEEMED? FIFTEEN POINT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. ONGOING TO COMPLETE THE BUILD OUT OF THE NECESSARY STATIONS FOR THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM AND SUPPORT THE EXISTING POSITIONS. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE INS INSTALLATION OF THE REMAINING TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING STATIONS OF THE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN STATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS. BEING NEEDED STATEWIDE. THE SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH ADVANCE WARNING WHEN AN EARTHQUAKE OCCURS WHICH WILL ALLOW TIME TO PREPARE OR STOCK CRITIC. AND STOP CRITICAL FUNCTIONS SUCH AS SURGERIES AND TRAINS PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF SHAKING. IN TWO AND TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN KELLY HAS RECEIVED A ONE TIME OF PREPARATION OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND FOUR POSITIONS TO INVEST. IN THE INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE OF THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM. AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE EIGHT WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY ONE TIME SAVINGS FROM GRANT FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE FOUR POSITIONS. HOWEVER THE FUNDING IS NOT SUSTAINABLE AND WE'RE REQUESTING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE POSITIONS AND PROVIDE A CONSISTENT AND SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE. TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS ON THIS REQUEST I HAVE WITH ME TODAY RYAN ARE. A HAPPY TO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD HAVE ALRIGHT SOUNDS GOOD. OF BEING GIVEN THIS IS MATHS. CHAU WILL SEE YELLOW IN THE BLUE WAS THE DIFFERENCE. YEAH SO IT'S STARTING WHERE I LIVE. YEAH YOU HAVE TO TAKE A GOOD EDUCATED GUESS THERE BUT STARTING IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER THAT WAS THE. ONE CALLAWAY ES RECEIVED ITS FIRST A GENERAL FUND HIGHER MISS SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUDGET THAT WAS WHERE WE WERE AT SO WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY BUILT OUT ON THAT. I'M NEEDED SENSOR DENSITY FOR ON THE STATEWIDE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM IT MOVING DOWN YOU SEE THE NEXT. BOX WHICH IS STATED ITS CURRENT THAT REFLECTS. WHAT HOW MUCH MORE CAPACITY WERE ABLE TO ADD WITH THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FUNDS AND IN THE FUTURE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING THIS BUDGET? REQUEST I'M WOULD BASICALLY COMPLETAS SENSOR BUILT OUT NO SIR I'M REPRESENTED BY THE YELLOW DOTS AND I'M SHOWING NON DOING TODAY AREAS WHICH HAVE LOWER. AND CENTER DENSITY TODAY. ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE BELIAU. UP WE RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE. WITHHOLD ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL UPENDING THE RELEASE OF THE FORTHCOMING BUSINESS PLAN. FROM THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ORIGINALLY DUE FEBRUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR BUT WHICH HAS BEEN DELAYED. AYE WITHOUT THE BUSINESS PLAN. WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE IT LACKS KEY INFORMATION CONCERNING. THE SYSTEMS COSTS AS WELL AS POTENTIAL AVAILABLE FUNDING SOURCES I THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE MERITS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S REQUEST. I WE FIND THAT. KEY COST IN FUNDING DETAILS FOR THE SYSTEM THAT ARE MISSING FROM THE PROPOSAL WHICH SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN THEM OF BUSINESS PLAN INCLUDES ASKS INFORMATION AS FIRST. THE FULL ARRAY OF EQUIPMENT THEY'LL BE POST OPERATE THE SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE GOING TO STAND THAT FROM DOCUMENTS ISSUED FROM. PREVIOUS MEETINGS OF THE SYSTEMS ADVISORY BOARD THAT. RATHER MADE ALSO BE GPS AND TELEMETRY NODES THAT NEED TO BE INSTALLED IN ADDITION TO THE SENSOR STATIONS. PROPOSAL WOULD PAY FOR A SECOND IT'S UNCLEAR. ABOUT WHAT THE TOTAL ONE TIME AND. ONGOING COSTS FOR THE SYSTEM ARE I THIS IS RELATED BOTH TO OUR COMMENTS ON THE EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS TO. THE ONGOING COSTS FOR WHICH WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT UNOFFICIAL ESTIMATES. TOLLING IN THE LOW TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THIS PROPOSAL ONLY REQUEST SEVENTY FIFTY THOUSAND. DOLLARS IN ONGOING A COST FOR PERSONNEL RELATED. COSTS WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE OTHER KNOWN. COSTS SUCH AS END USER EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMONG A FEW OTHERS. BUT THIRD THERE'S ALSO UNCERTAINTY OVER THE AVAILABILITY OF THE MONTREAL FUND REVENUE SOURCES THAT CAN BE APPLIED. TO THE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS. AS WELL AS HOW. MUCH OFTEN SUPPORT WILL BE. REQUIRED TO COVER THE REMAINING ONGOING COSTS. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE SYSTEM HAS RECEIVED FUNDS HAS MENTIONED. FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES IT IN THE PAST. AND THAT ARE ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE BUSINESS PLAN IS TO IDENTIFY NOT JOURNAL FUND REVENUE SOURCES FOR THE SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT COMMITTED TO COVER ALL OF THE NOT PERSONAL RELATED ON GOING COSTS. WITH NIGEL FUND SOURCES. AND FINALLY WE BELIEVE BY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S SHE SHOULD PROVIDE LEGISLATURE WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE. OPERATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS THE US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THERE'S STILL UNCERTAINTY IN THIS REGARD AND I WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEMS ADVISORY BOARD HAS PREVIOUSLY CITED OTHER CLEAR DELINEATION OF ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AMONG THE STAKEHOLDERS OF. STRATEGIC. CLOONEY NEVER COME INTO QUESTIONS. ANY. COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE ANY OF THOSE IN FAVOR. ANY POST OKAY FINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL. OBVIOUSLY TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THANKS FOR THE. SOMEWHAT HELPFUL WITH THOSE AND I HOPE WE WILL GET THE ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE LA JOH COMMENTS FROM BETWEEN NOW AND THE TIME WITH TO MAKE FUNDING DECISIONS. I LAST ITEM FOR THE DAY IS ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY SUSTAIN SUSTAINMENT OKAY YEAH SO WHERE KRISTEN APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AND SIX POSITIONS AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION TO NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE. THE FIGHTER COSTS FOR THIS PROJECT WILL BE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. THIS WOMAN'S AND I ONE ONE SYSTEM FROM AN ANALOG SYSTEM TO A DIGITAL SYSTEM WHICH IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO SUPPORT NEW TECH. LOGICAL DEMANDS SUCH AS DATA SHARING THEM LOCATION ACCURACY. THAT PROVIDE BETTER COVERAGE WITH WHEN OUTAGES FOR EVACUATIONS OCCUR. AND ALLOW FOR INTEGRATION WITH THE FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY WHICH IS MORE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS FOR SNACK. TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS ON THIS REQUEST I HAVE WITH ME TODAY. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT MITCH. MEG. AND I CAN'T GET YOUR LAST NAME RIGHT INSIDE OF. THANK YOU ADMITS MEDICAID WHICH. NICE TO BE HERE THANK CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SUFFER TIME TODAY. I I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT. THIS IS A CRITICAL A PIECE FOR US. THESE. THIS AUTHORITY THE SPENDING AUTHORITY INCREASE FOR US. FOR THE USE OF CERTAIN OF FUNDS IN THE POSITIONS. WILL ALLOW US TO MOVE FOR FOR THE NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE. OKAY WE REALIZE THAT ON THERE SOME CONCERNS ON. WHERE THE STATUS OF CERTAIN IS AND AND SOME THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING THERE? BUT WITH OUT THIS AUTHORITY IN THE POSITIONS WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD NEXT GENERATION I WON ONE. AND IT'S BEEN CRITICAL. IT YOU KNOW THIS LAST YEAR. WE HAD. NUMEROUS PRESIDENTIAL OF DISASTERS. AND IT HIGHLIGHTED THE NECESSITY OF A. YOU KNOW VERY EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE RESILIENCY FOR GONNA IMPROVE REDUNDANCY INTO FOR GUN IMPROVE EFFICIENCY WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE PROGRAM FOR US. AND OF CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO LEAD THE NATIONAL. ARCHITECTURE ON NINE ONE ONE FOR ME TO BE PART OF THAT DESIGN PART OF THE STANDARDS IN MAKING THAT FOR WE HAVE TO BE OUT FRONT. OF FROM RIGHT NOW WERE ON THE CUSP OF MOVING FORWARD WE'VE DONE THE PLANNING WOULD ON THE STAFFING WOULD ON THE PILOTS. BUT WE NEED THESE POSITIONS AND THEN ULTIMATELY EVER INDEED THE SPELLING CHRIS SPENDING AUTHORITY WITHIN THE SECOND ACCOUNT. TO MAKE THIS A REALITY OF FOR US. THE OTHER PIECE TO THIS IS THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR FEDERAL FUNDING TO COME DOWN TO ASSIST US WITH NEXT GENERATION I WON ONE. BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE IT. AND SO WITHOUT HAVING. THE AUTHORITY AND THE POSITIONS. IF WE GOT THE MONEY WE WOULD NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH THAT FEDERAL. MODEL NOW WE HAVEN'T GOT A GUARANTEE WHEN THAT MONEY'S GOING TO COME OR IF IT'S GOING TO COME. BUT WE KNOW THE DISCUSSIONS TAKING PLACE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL NOW AND THERE'S. INCREASED INTEREST ON MOVING MONEY TO THE STATES FOR NEXT GENERATION I WON BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE. HOW IMPORTANT IS AS WELL? A WE HAD TWENTY MILLION CALLS LAST YEAR IN THE NINE ONE SYSTEM. AND AND WE SEE NO REASON FOR THAT TO DECREASE AT ALL AND IN FACT WILL LIKELY INCREASE TO IT. AND WE'RE SEEING SOME FASTENING DYNAMICS AS WE'RE MOVING TO TEXAS NINE ONE ONE IN OTHER AREAS FOR IT. SO. WELL WITH THAT I HAVE BUDGET CURRIER WHO'S MY NINE ONE BRANCH MANAGER WITH ME AND HE'S GOT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF OF QUICK. UPDATES ON HOW OUR TECHNOLOGIES CONNECT SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THAT. WE HAVE SOME SLIDES OF FOR THE MEMBERS. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME'S BUDGE CAREER ON THE NINE ONE BRANCH MANAGERS MITCH SAID SO IN FRONT OF YOU HAVE THIS GRAPHIC HERE CONNECTING THE TECHNOLOGY. WE KNOW THE SPACE IS. A CONFUSING AND. DYNAMIC AND SO THIS GRAPHIC IS TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW THESE CONNECT THESE TECHNOLOGIES CONNECT ONE WITH ANOTHER. CC NEXT GEN NOT NINE ONE IS ON THIS GRAPHIC AND THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON WHEN YOU NEED HELP AND YOU HAVE THESE VARIOUS DEVICES. NEXT GEN I'M ONE IS HOW YOU GET THAT INFORMATION INVOICE INTO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO COORDINATE THE RESPONSE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HELP YOU NEED ARRIVES SO NEXT GEN I'M ONE IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. ONCE IT ARRIVES AT THAT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT THEY'RE USING LAND MOBILE RADIO TO COORDINATE. DISPATCH OPERATIONS WITH THOSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS IN THE FIELD AND THEN THE FIRST MATTER BROADBAND SERVICES IS HOW THAT DATA IS GETTING FROM THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS. OUT TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND THEN ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAPHIC WAS SHOWN THIS IS A DIFFERENT PATH BECAUSE IT IS. AND THIS IS THE WAY THAT ALERTS AND WARNINGS WOULD WOULD BE UPSET FROM THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY THAT SITE AUTHORIZED TO SEND THAT ALERT WARNING. BACK OUT TO THE TO THOSE THAT THAT NEED TO RECEIVE THOSE WARNINGS. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT I'VE WITH INFORMATION FLOW HERE NEXT JANICE IS CRITICAL TO BRING THIS DATA INTO THE NINE ONE. PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS. THE NEXT GRAPHIC JUST REALLY KIND HIGHLIGHTS THAT IMPORTANCE. NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE IS BRINGING IN THOSE RICH DATA SOURCES WHETHER IT'S TEXTER VIDEO OR ON OTHER. APPLICATION DATA THAT MIGHT BE RUNNING AS WELL AS VOICE INTO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT AND HAS THIS CONNECTION PIECE TO FIRST MATTER BROADBAND SERVICES SO THAT DATA CAN BE SENT. OUT TO THE FIELD. AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS TRANSITION TO NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE. IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IF WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. NOW NEXT GEN I'M ONE HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER OUR CURRENT NETWORK. PROBABLY THE BEST EXAMPLE I CAN GIVE IS DURING THE ORVILLE DAM INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED. EARLIER BUT LET'S SAY I WAS RUNNING A PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT AND AND YOU RUNNING ONE WE HAD AN AGREEMENT AND A AND A HARD CONNECTION BETWEEN US. THE ONE I EVACUATE I CAN SEND MY CALLS TO YOU AND VICE VERSA. THAT WORKS REALLY WELL INTO WE BOTH HAVE TO EVACUATE WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED IN OR FULL. NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE IS IS A NETWORK THAT INTERCONNECTS ALL THESE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS OF THESE CALLS COULD LITERALLY BE ANSWERED ANYWHERE. AND HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER ADVANTAGES AS WELL INCREASED DIVE FASTER CALL DELIVERY WERE POSITION BETTER FOR INCREASED THOUGH CASH LOCATION ACCURACY. AT SOME OF THE DATA RICH FEATURES THAT COLUMN IN WHAT YOU EXPECT TODAY AB TO BE ABLE TO SEND INTO A PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS. NEXT GEN POSITIONS US FOR THAT. SO THAT'S WHY WE WE FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT. OMINOUS MITCH SAIDWE WE DO HAVE A. LITTLE OVER TWENTY EIGHT MILLION CALLS THAT WE BRING IN. WILL. WE'RE PREPARED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT. A REVENUE SOURCE AND AND AND THE SET THE FUND AND HOW IT'S BEEN DECLINING. A REALLY THAT'S PRIMARILY DO SO THAT'S THIS NEXT GRAPH THAT YOU SEE HERE. ON THAT THE CHARTS. AS IT GOES DOWN. RIGHT NOW OUR FUNDING MODEL IS BASED ON INTEREST STATE VOICE IT WAS A FANTASTIC MODEL BEFORE THE INVENTION OF SMARTPHONES. BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE SMARTPHONES A MAJORITY OF OF YOUR WIRELESS PHONE BILL GOES TOWARD DATA AND NOT VOICE AND SO THAT REVENUE. IT IS NOT SOMETHING WE'RE COLLECTING AGAINST THE D. DATA REVENUE PORTION OF YOUR WIRELESS BILL. THAT'S CONTRIBUTED TO THIS RED LINE GOING DOWN ABOUT SIX PERCENT PER YEAR AND WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT TREND IT'S IT'S CONTINUING TO DROP ABOUT SIX PERCENT PER YEAR. SO WE KNOW WE NEED IT. FUNDING MODEL TO SUPPORT THIS WHAT WE HAVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WE'VE INTRODUCED TO CORRECT THE FUNDING MODEL SO THAT ONCE WE GET THE APPROPRIATIONS TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO BUILD OUT NEXT AND I AM ONE. WE'VE PROPOSED A STABLE FUNDING MODEL TO TAKE A STAND TO THE NEXT TEN TWENTY YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT NEXT GEN I'M ONE AND AND THEN I WANT SYSTEM IS SUSTAIN. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS OR FINANCE BELIAU. WELL OKAY READ MOST AGREE ANY ANY. COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. THOSE IN FAVOR OF. OKAY. PRESSES YOU GIVE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AGENCY THAT YOU REPRESENT MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SAYS STEVE CARLTON GIPSON CTIA THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATION WANTED A. TO THANK OF COMMITTEE STAFF WE HAVE SENT AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WITH WE'VE OF WORKING VERY CLOSELY. AS SAID MR CARTER INDICATED WILL BE. IN THE COURSE OF MODIFYING THE MATTER IN WHICH THAT THE NIGHT ON ONE FEE IS. HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY COLLECTED. THAT WE'RE KIND OF A BIG DEAL FOR THE CELL PHONE INDUSTRY HAVING DONE SO AND AND. FOR SO MANY YEARS. WE THINK WE'RE VERY VERY VERY CLOSE. TO AGREEMENT ON. ON PRETTY MUCH ALL ASPECTS OF. OF WHAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE. MET BUT MISS KIM THE OTHER DAY. AND AND KIND OF WENT THROUGH THAT SO WE. WOULD URGE THE MEASURE DEBATE TO BE. TO ME BILL FORWARD AND AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS. ANY OPPOSITION. OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING WE THINK VERY HIGHLY OF SELF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PROPOSAL AND THIS ITEM TO WILL BE HELD OVER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
