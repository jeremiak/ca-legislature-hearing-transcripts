SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND HERE. A

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:50.016
SCHOOL DISTRICTS CURRENTLY OWN

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:51.317
ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND SCHOOL

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:53.286
BUSES NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THOSE

00:05:53.352 --> 00:05:55.121
BUSES ARE DIESEL. IN MANY OF

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.255
THOSE DIESEL BUSES ARE OLDER

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:57.523
MODELS THAT WERE MANUFACTURED

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.624
UNDER LESS STRINGENT EMISSION

00:05:58.691 --> 00:05:59.859
STANDARDS THAN THOSE EXISTING

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:02.628
TODAY. OTHER MAJOR DISTRICTS

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:03.763
FLEETS GENERALLY OPERATE ON A

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.831
ALTERNATIVE FUELS MAINLY

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.199
COPRESSED NATURAL GAS OR

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:08.501
PROPANE. ELECTRIC BUSES ARE THE

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:10.069
NEWEST OPTION DISTRICTS BEYOND

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:12.371
BUYING ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:12.972
CURRENTLY OWNS SEVERAL HUNDRED

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.641
STATEWIDE. ELECTRIC BUSES HAVE

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:17.577
SNORKEL ADVANTAGES THAT THEY DO

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:18.578
NOT PRODUCE ANY TAILPIPE

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:20.813
EMISSIONS HONEYMOON HELPS. IT

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.851
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS GREENHOUSE.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.786
GAS AND TO BE TO OPERATE BECAUSE

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:28.020
THEY LIKE. TO TRY TO BE JUST

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:30.356
LAST SIX AND YOU FUEL. AT THE

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:32.024

TODAY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND A

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.829
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES. IN THAT

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:37.930
RANGE CAN OFTEN BE LASSEN

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:39.332
STRENUOUS OPERATING CONDITIONS

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:40.800
LIKE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN ARE HOT

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:42.468
AND COLD WEATHER. AND THE UP

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:44.337
FRONT COST AN ELECTRIC BUS ALSO

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:46.539
ARE ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH AS THE

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:49.108

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:51.611

SMALLER STATE PROGRAMS. THAT WE

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.158
THINK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:07.860
ADVANCED A PROMISING IDEA. USING

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:08.728
ONE TIME FUNDS TO PURCHASE

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:09.829
ELECTRIC BUSES COULD PROVIDE

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.164
EMISSION BENEFITS THAT WOULD

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.932
LAST FOR MANY YEARS. AND IT

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.367
WOULD GIVE DISTRICTS SOME COST

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:15.768
RELEASE- BOTH RELATED TO THE

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:18.104
COST OF REPLACING OLDER BUSES.

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:20.239
AND OVER A LONGER PERIOD THE

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:21.440
COST OF PURCHASING FUEL. I WOULD

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:24.377
RECOMMEND YOU ADOPT THE PROPOSAL

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:26.412
I WAS A COUPLE OF MODIFICATIONS.

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:27.547
THE FIRST WOULD BE TO MAKE SPEED

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.816
MY MAIN PRIORITY OF THE PROGRAM-

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:31.784
THE REPLACEMENT OF OLDER BUSES.

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:32.785
SO WHERE IS THE GOVERNOR

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:34.921
PROPOSES THE AGE OF THE BUSES

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:36.289
BEING REPLACED AS ONE FACTOR.

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:37.390
YOU RECKON MAKING IT THE MAIN

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:40.359
FACTOR. AND THAT'S BECAUSE OLDER

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:42.061
BUSES EMIT MORE POLLUTION

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.162
REPLACING THEM FIRST BUT

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:47.533
MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL. AIR

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.100
QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS. WE ARE

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:49.969
ALLOWING FOR OTHER TYPES OF. AND

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:52.205
BUS ARE NOT. THIS IS AN ISSUE

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:53.639
PRIMARY AFFECTS DISTRICTS WITH

00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:56.342
LONGER. ROUTE AND IN THOSE

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:59.145
DISTRICTS REPLACING OLDER NOT

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:00.746
YOU NOT LIKE BUSQUETS ACHIEVE

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:02.548
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:04.684
POLLUTION. THAT WE RECOMMEND

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.952
ELIMINATING THE QUESTION OF THE

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:06.819
GRANTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:08.588
FUNDING FOR OTHER TRANSPORTATION%

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:11.858
COSTS. US ABOUT 10% OF THE

00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:13.159
PROPOSAL. I THAT QUESTION OF THE

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.360
GRANT TO BUY DOES NOT SEEM

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:15.561
CLEARLY CONNECTED WITH

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:17.363
UNDERLYING COSTS OF PURCHASING

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.331
LIKE TO SCHOOL BUSES WERE

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:19.565
RUNNING A SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:21.868
PROGRAM. WE ALSO HAVE SOME

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:22.702
CONCERNS THAT IT COULD

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:24.070
DISCOURAGE DISTRICTS REPLYING

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.371
FOR BUS REPLACEMENT FUNDING FROM

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:26.772
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR OTHER

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.441
STATE PROGRAMS. SOME OF THOSE

00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:31.611
OTHER PROGRAMS DO NOT PROVIDE

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:32.645
THAT ADDITIONAL ON. I WOULD

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:33.746
RECKON STARTING OF THE SMALLER

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:35.514
INITIAL TO THE POINT. AND

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:38.784
ALLOCATE FUNDING SEVERAL. WHICH

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:39.719
WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:41.320
OPPORTUNITY YOU TO ADJUST THE

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:43.256
PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE BASED ON

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:45.558
INTEREST IN THE PROGRESS OF THE

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.592
STATE NEXT TOWARDS A PLACING.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:49.161
THE OLDER BUSES SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:50.329
ONE OPTION COULD BE TO START

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:52.064
WITH AN INITIAL ALLOCATION OF

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:53.399
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. THAT WOULD

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:55.167
BE ENOUGH TO REPLACE MORE THAN A

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.502
THOUSAND SCHOOL BUSES AND THEN

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:59.572
PLAN FOR SUBSEQUENT INSTALLMENTS

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:00.740
OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. IF YOU

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.308
DO START WITH THE FULL ONE POINT

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.542
FIVE BILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:05.011
PROPOSES. WE'D RECOMMEND

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:06.178
ALLOWING SOME OF THAT FUNDING TO

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:07.813
BE USED FOR EXPANDING DISTRICT

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.081
FLEETS NOT JUST A PLACING

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:11.284
DISTINCT BUSES. AND THAT

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.285
APPROACH WOULD ENSURE THAT THE

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:13.386
STATE CAN ALLOCATE THE FULL

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:15.855
AMOUNT INTERESTED INTERESTED

00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:18.157
DISTRICTS. WELL WOULD SEE

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.892
CONCERT WHICH DAY AGENCY AS BEST

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:20.860
POSITIONED TO ADMINISTER THE

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:23.896
PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:25.464
IT TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:27.166
OF EDUCATION WE THINK THEY ARE

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.901
CAPABLE OF MANAGING THE PROGRAM

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:29.602
THEY BY MANY TYPES OF

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:31.203
COMPETITIVE GRANTS AND THEY

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.471
PREVIOUSLY MANAGED A SMALL BUS

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:33.706
REPLACEMENT PROGRAM FOR SMALL

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:36.342
DISTRICTS. ON THE OTHER HAND THE

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.910
CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:39.178
ALREADY OVERSEES THE BUS

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.546
REPLACEMENT PROGRAM CREATED IN

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:42.748
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND A

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:44.150
DIVIDING TO SIMILAR PROGRAMS

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:45.985
ACROSS THE TWO AGENCIES LIKE WE

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:47.853
WOULD REQUIRE I BOTH HAVE AN

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.588
EDUCATION AND THE CALIFORNIA AIR

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:51.057
RESOURCES BOARD TO ENGAGE IN

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:52.224
SOME SIGNIFICANT COORDINATION

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.759
SINCE MANY DISTRICTS LIKE THAT

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:58.197
WOULD APPLY FOR BOTH. BOTH BOTH

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.167
GRANT PARK. I THIS NEW APPROACH

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:02.702
TO THE AREAS BOARD MIGHT AVOID

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:04.770
OF THAT AND FORTH YES ONE

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:07.406
RESPONDING ELKE PROCESS. AND

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:08.207
THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMON. THANK

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.675
YOU VERY MUCH MOVE TO THE

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:10.876
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:13.479
EDUCATION. WHY MISTER CHAIR

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:15.247
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:16.849
MY NAME IS JUANITA ELLIS I'M THE

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:17.717
DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:19.185
FACILITIES AND TRANSPORTATION

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:21.253
SERVICES DIVISION ATTY IT'S A

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.421
PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:24.590
TODAY. FIRST WE DO WANT TO THANK

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:25.891
THE ADMINISTRATION FOR PROPOSING

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.527
SUCH A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN

00:10:28.594 --> 00:10:30.329
THE AREA SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:32.465
WE KNOW THAT MANY STUDENTS RELY

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:33.499
ON A SCHOOL BUS TO BE ABLE TO

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:36.068
GET TO SCHOOL EACH DAY. IN FACT

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:36.535
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:38.404
APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.639
STUDENTS AND TRANSPORTED DAILY.

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:42.008
TRANSFERS TO ATTEND SCHOOL BUS

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:43.376
HAS PROVEN NOT TO BE NOT ONLY

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.478
THE SAFEST WAYTO GET TO SCHOOL.

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:47.346
BUT IT ALSO HELPS REMOVE OTHER

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:49.015
CARS FROM THE ROAD. AS ONE

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:50.449
SCHOOL BUS CAN CARRY THE

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:51.784
EQUIVALENT ABOUT THIRTY SIX

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:55.121
CARS. WE ALSO AGREE THE OLDER

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:56.789
SCHOOL BUSES NEED TO BE REPLACED

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:58.758
WITH NEWER TECHNOLOGY. THAT WILL

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:00.359
NOT ONLY HELP CALIFORNIA ACHIEVE

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:02.261
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. BUT

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.729
THEY WILL ALSO LOWER THE

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:04.864
OPERATIONAL COST FOR OUR DAILY

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.033
AS- AND NOT JUST MUCH MORE SHORT

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:10.469
TERM BUT FOR MANY YEARS TO COME

00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:11.937
. TO THAT END WE WE'RE THRILLED

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:13.572
THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSING TO

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.408
INVEST ONE POINT FIVE BILLION.

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:16.475
FOR THE CREATION OF THE SCHOOL

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:18.077
TRANSPORTATION GRANT PROGRAM. TO

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:19.645
REPLACE OLDER BUSES IN SOME OF

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:21.514
THE NEEDIEST AREAS OF THE STATE.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.282
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE FUNDING

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:25.818
WILL REPLACE APPROXIMATELY THREE

00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:27.686
THOUSAND OLDER BUSES. SO THE

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:29.655
IMPACT THAT THIS INVESTMENT WILL

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:31.123
HAVE ON OUR SCHOOLS. OUR

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.893
COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:35.127
IN GENERAL IS QUITE CLEAR. OF

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:36.662
COURSE ADMINISTERING SUCH A

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:37.963
LARGE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THROUGH

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.231
A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:40.599
WOULD REQUIRE DEDICATED

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:42.168
RESOURCES TO ENSURE THE

00:11:42.234 --> 00:11:44.036
PROGRAM'S SUCCESS. WE LOOK

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:45.237
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE

00:11:45.304 --> 00:11:46.872
LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION FUNDS

COMMENTS. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:55.381
QUESTIONS AND I'M GOING TO

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S JUST

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:03.322
POINTED OUT THAT THIS WOULD

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.424
CREATE TO GRANT PROGRAMS INTO

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:07.426
DEPARTMENTS THAT NEED TO BE

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:12.665
COORDINATED AND- FOR- MIGHT BE

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:17.403
CONFUSING AND- WHY. OF DID YOU

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.438
CHOOSE TO HAVE THESE TWO

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:22.174
PROGRAMS- IT DID NOT PUT OF THE

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.977
ADMINISTRATION OF. OF THIS NEW

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:28.380

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M STILL

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.554
ALTHOUGH CARDS FUNDING OF

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.623
ELECTRIC BUSES THAT'S PROVIDE

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.792
INCENTIVE. GRANT SUPPORT I

SCHOOL BUS THAT THOSE INCENTIVES

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.364
OUT SURE IS ONLY PARTIALLY COVER

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.466
THE COST OF AN ELECTRIC BUS IN

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.268
BED POGRAM WE'RE PROPOSING

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:51.170
WOULD BE PROPOSING TO OUR ALL

RIGHT REPLACE A DIESEL BUSES

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:54.406
WITH ELECTRIC BUS AT A MINIMUM

00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:55.708
IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE.

00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:57.143
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ACQUIRE

00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:58.210

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROGRAM

00:13:05.484 --> 00:13:07.520
SO WE CAN BETTER ALIGN OUR

AND THE MAY REVISE YOU GIVE REAL

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:47.920
CONSIDERATION TO WHETHER OR NOT

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:49.421
THEY SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED IN

00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:51.824

THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:57.496
OTHER THINGS I MEAN IF YOU LOOK

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.098
AT THE CLEAN WATER PROGRAM WHERE

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:00.666

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:04.837
MANY NOT GETTING OUT THE DOOR

WATER BOARD AND IF IN THE- ARM.

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:13.112
IN THE END ID IT HAD TO BE MOVED

TO THE WATER BOARDS SO THAT THAT

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:16.615
KIND OF COORDINATION HAPPENED

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:17.283
FORTY AND I THINK THE SAME THING

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:18.951
IS HAPPENING HERE AND WE HAVE A

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:20.152

BECAUSE WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:43.609
CRITICISM. OF FROM FROM

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:45.210

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.443
ENOUGH IT'S ESTIMATED THAT IT

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.212
MIGHT COST THREE BILLION DOLLARS

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:36.048
WHICH IS EXACTLY THE AMOUNT. OF

00:18:36.114 --> 00:18:40.319

ARE IN THIS BUDGET FOR REPLACING

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:03.909

BILL- S. B. THE PROPOSAL BY I

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.739
SURE SKINNER BUT JUST FOR SUNDAY

00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:35.474
CONTEXT UNDER CURRENT LAW

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:36.475
DISTRICTS DECIDE WHETHER TO

OF THE MANIC SUBSTANCE

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:45.551
DISABILITIES WHO SOMETIMES

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:46.385

INDIVIDUAL DISABILITY MISS. SO I

00:19:50.155 --> 00:19:51.623
UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BILL IS

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.025
THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE DISTRICTS

MORE THAN ONE MILE AWAY I

00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:04.937
DISTRICTS COULD MEET THAT

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:06.338
REQUIREMENTS BY PROVIDING

REIMBURSEMENT. AND ALLOCATED TO

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:25.591
INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS BASED

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:27.192

ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF YOU HAVE

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:05.564
ANY QUESTIONS ON ISSUE NUMBER

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:11.336
ONE. SENATOR MEANT. SO I JUST

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:13.071
WANT TO FOLLOW ON SOME OF THE

00:21:13.138 --> 00:21:14.740
QUESTIONS THAT CHAIR THERE WAS

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:16.708
ANYTHING EVER SO I WAS ONE- WHAT

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:19.444
HOW MANY SCHOOL BUSES ARE THEIR

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:20.379
IMPACT IN THE STATE OF

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.280
CALIFORNIA MAYBE I MISSED THAT.

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:24.683
IN OUR HAND OUT. AND WHO ARE YOU

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.317
DIRECT TARGET BEAT ANYONE WHO

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:26.818
KNOWS BUT IT PRESUMABLY IN PART

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:29.021
IN EDUCATION. WELL I THINK TWO

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:30.622
OF THEM ARE HOPING THAT THE

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:34.559
THIRD ONE OF CFS QUESTION RIGHT

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:35.394
. I MEAN I'M JUST LOOKING FOR

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.598
BALK. HI MY- YEAH YEAH THANK YOU

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:42.668
CENTER IN US. CURRENTLY BELIEVE

00:21:42.734 --> 00:21:43.669
BILL LATER INDICATE THAT SCHOOL

00:21:43.735 --> 00:21:47.105
DISTRICT PHONE ABOUT FIFTEEN.

00:21:47.172 --> 00:21:49.374
EIGHT HUNDRED BUSES AND PRIVATE

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:50.275
CONTRACTORS SERVING SCHOOL

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:52.077
DISTRICTS ON ANOTHER NINE

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:55.714
THOUSAND OR SO BUSES SO- ROUGHLY

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:56.314
TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND BUSES IN

00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:58.950
THE STATE BUT THAT FIFTEEN

00:21:59.017 --> 00:21:59.584
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED OWNED BY

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:01.086
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THE ONES

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:01.720
THAT ARE THE FOCUS OF THIS

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:03.989
PROPOSAL. AND JUST A FOLLOW UP

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:05.524
ON THAT THEN- MISTER CAP

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.060
ACCOUNT. LOOKS ON THE PHONE

00:22:08.126 --> 00:22:10.228
SORRY- HOW MANY RIGHT NOW ARE

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:13.231
LIKE TRICK OR ZERO EMISSIONS.

00:22:13.298 --> 00:22:15.233
RIGHT NOW ALL UNDER IS JUST OWN

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.470
SEVERAL OF THOSE- STATEWIDE- WE

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:21.506
DON'T HAVE A- EXACT NUMBER-

00:22:21.573 --> 00:22:23.008
PARTLY IT'S BECAUSE MANY

00:22:23.075 --> 00:22:24.543
DISTRICTS WE NO HAVE ORDERED-

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:25.877
BUSES BUT HAVEN'T RECEIVED THEM

00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:28.146
YET SO THE NUMBER IS INCREASING

00:22:28.213 --> 00:22:30.015
ALL OF. YOU KNOW INCREASING. AS

00:22:30.082 --> 00:22:31.450
TIME GOES ON BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:33.018
JUST A COUPLE HUNDRED A

00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:34.786
STATEWIDE. NOW AND ANALYSIS THAT

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:36.254
WE RECEIVE FROM LA- WHICH I TAKE

00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:39.324
ISSUE- WE- HAD IT SAID IT WAS

00:22:39.391 --> 00:22:40.892
ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND ROUGHLY

00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:42.427
FOR THE BUS PLUS CHARGING

00:22:42.494 --> 00:22:44.329
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EACH NEW BUS.

00:22:44.396 --> 00:22:47.766
AND SO- I THINK IF WE DO THE

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:48.900
MATH IT'S AT A HUNDRED FIFTY

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:52.704
BUSES THAT'S WHAT WE GET FOR ONE

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:54.973
POINT FIVE BILLION. SO THE WAY

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.541
THE PROPOSAL IS CONSTRUCTED IS

00:22:56.608 --> 00:22:57.809
THAT ASSUMES THAT DISTRICTS

00:22:57.876 --> 00:22:59.811
WOULD SPEND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:00.479
THOUSAND TO PURCHASE EACH BUS IN

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:02.447
ANOTHER FIFTY THOUSAND HONEST

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:05.484
CHARGING STATION. AT SEVEN FOUR

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.418
HUNDRED THOUSAND OKAY I THINK I

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:07.853
MISSED READ THIS INSTEAD OF A

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:08.553
HUNDRED THOUSAND I. THINK

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.589
SOMEWHERE BUT SO IT'S LIKE

00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:11.857
LESSEN THAT SAYS WE'RE TALKING

00:23:11.923 --> 00:23:13.158
ABOUT WHAT THIRTY PLUS NO NO NO

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:17.229
NO YOU'RE- DROPPING ZERO IN

00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:19.431
THERE SOMEWHERE. THREE ABOUT

00:23:19.498 --> 00:23:22.267
THREE THOUSAND. SO ELECTRIC. I'M

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:25.604
SORRY YOUR OKAY. IT'S OKAY SO

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.906
THAT'LL MAKE A FEEL THAT- AND I

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:29.074
GUESS MY QUESTION YOU KNOW I'VE

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:31.243
- THE- O. C. T. A. MY OWN.

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:32.644
COUNTY TRANSIT. NOT SO LONG AGO.

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:33.812
AND THEY WERE TELLING ME THEY

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:35.113
WERE STILL. BETWEEN HYDROGEN

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.314
ELECTRIC IN AND KIND OF. TAKEN

00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:38.083
SOME ELECTRIC AND SOME HYDROGEN.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.718
THIS PROPOSAL ENVISIONS THAT

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:41.820
EVERYTHING WILL BE ELECTRIC. ONE

00:23:41.887 --> 00:23:42.554
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WAS

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:44.823
EXPRESSLY BY- CTAS JUST THAT THE

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.191
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS SO

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.493
EXPENSIVE AND SO- I DON'T KNOW

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.295
IF IT CHANGES FOR SCHOOL BUSES

00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:51.263
SINCE YOU JUST HAVE SO FEWOF

00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:53.765
THEM- BUT- C. T. EXPRESSED TO ME

00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:55.500
THEY WOULD HAVE TO. INVEST

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:57.269
SIGNIFICANTLY MASSIVE AMOUNTS TO

00:23:57.335 --> 00:23:58.970
TRY TO BUILD UP THE TYPE OF

00:23:59.037 --> 00:23:59.404
ELECTRICAL CHARGING

00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:01.406
INFRASTRUCTURE THEY NEED TO.

00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:02.674
CONTINUOUSLY CHARGE THEIR BOSSES

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:04.509
SO THAT THEY BE REGULAR

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:07.145
REGULARLY A QUICK TO GO- YOU

00:24:07.212 --> 00:24:08.747
KNOW THERE'S CHALLENGES AND

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:09.681
TRADEOFFS BETWEEN HYDROGEN AND

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:11.449
ELECTRIC BUT- I WAS WONDERING

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:12.651
IF. EITHER THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:14.186
FINANCE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION

00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:15.954
COULD COMMENT ON THE DECISION

00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:19.291
TO. CHOOSE A LACK FOR IT ONLY AS

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:20.792
OPPOSED TO ZERO EMISSIONS AS

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:24.596
WE'VE OFTEN DONE IN. THIS- IN

00:24:24.663 --> 00:24:26.598
THE STATE. LENA GRANT PARK A

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:28.934
FINANCE SO. THE WAY THAT THE-

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.168
THE PROGRAMS CURRENTLY

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:31.803
STRUCTURED AND PROPOSED IN THE

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.872
TRAILER BILL. IS BUT PROVIDING

00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:35.106
FUNDING FOR THE OUTRIGHT

00:24:35.173 --> 00:24:37.309
REPLACING OF THE BUS THAT'S FOUR

00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:38.643
HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THEN AN

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:39.678
ADDITIONAL FIFTY THOUSAND FOR

00:24:39.744 --> 00:24:40.579
THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:43.148
STATION. SO THAT WOULD COVER THE

00:24:43.215 --> 00:24:45.584
COST OF CHARGING THAT THE BUS

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.687
SO- I'M NOT SURE IF MAYBE THEY

00:24:48.753 --> 00:24:50.488
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE

00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:52.057
CURRENT INCENTIVE VOUCHER

00:24:52.123 --> 00:24:53.758
PROGRAM THAT EXISTS WITH THE CAR

00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:55.093
BECAUSE THAT IS THE PARTIAL

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.561
COVERING UP THE COST. THAT'S

00:24:56.628 --> 00:25:00.799
WHAT OUT RIGHT PROVIDE FUNDING.

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:01.800
FOR THE FULL ELECTRIC BUS

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:03.335
REPLACEMENT. OKAY BUT I'M NOT

00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:05.036
SURE THAT INTERNET QUESTION I

00:25:05.103 --> 00:25:06.404
THINK MY QUESTIONIS WHY DID WE

00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:08.440
CHOOSE WE MADE A DECISION TO

00:25:08.506 --> 00:25:10.108
CHOOSE ELECTRIC AND NOT JUST

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.410
SIMPLY DO ZERO EMISSIONS AS WE

00:25:12.477 --> 00:25:13.712
OFTEN HAVE DONE. AND GIVEN SORT

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:16.648
OF WHAT I WAS TOLD WAS A VERY

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:18.049
HIGH COST OF CHARGING

00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:19.384
INFRASTRUCTURE I DON'T KNOW

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:20.318
FIFTY THOUSAND IS THE RIGHT

00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:22.687
AMOUNT OR NOT- WHY DID WE MAKE

00:25:22.754 --> 00:25:24.856
THAT NORMATIVE CHOICE TO

00:25:24.923 --> 00:25:26.524
PREFERENCE ELECTRIC OVER. THE

00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:29.561
HYDROGEN. BUT WE BELIEVE A GREAT

00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:31.296
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE WERE

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:33.064
WE WERE LOOKING TO MAKE THAT

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.633
KIND OF THE BIGGEST CLIMATE

00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:36.468
IMPACT POSSIBLE WITH THIS THIS

00:25:36.534 --> 00:25:37.802
FUNDING. AND GIVEN THE HIGH

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:40.105
NUMBER OF- DIESEL BUSES THAT

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:41.539
CURRENTLY OPERATE THE STATE YOU

00:25:41.606 --> 00:25:42.908
WANTED TO. WE WANTED TO MAKE

00:25:42.974 --> 00:25:44.476
THE- GREATEST IMPACT YOU KNOW

00:25:44.542 --> 00:25:45.644
HAVE THE DOLLAR GO THE FURTHEST

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.345
SO THE ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUS

00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:50.916
OPTIONS SEEM TO. PROVIDE THAT-

00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:53.051
THAT OPPORTUNITY- SO THAT WAS

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:54.920
OUR OUR KIND OF REASONING FOR

00:25:54.986 --> 00:25:56.254
GOING WITH ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES

00:25:56.321 --> 00:25:58.290
RATHER THAN ALLOWING. A VARIETY

00:25:58.356 --> 00:26:00.025
OF OTHERS AS SOME OTHER.

00:26:00.091 --> 00:26:02.093
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO. OKAY A

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.461
BIT BECAUSE WHEN I TALK TO THEM

00:26:03.528 --> 00:26:04.896
AGAIN AND THIS IS JUST ONE DATA

00:26:04.963 --> 00:26:06.398
POINT BUT WHEN I TALK TO MY

00:26:06.464 --> 00:26:08.533
LOCAL. TRANSIT AUTHORITY DID

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.634
EXPRESS ME THEY HAD CONCERNS

00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:10.936
ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF CHARGING

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:12.203
INFRASTRUCTURE ASSOCIATE WITH

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.406
ELECTRIC. AND DEPENDING ON WHAT

00:26:14.472 --> 00:26:15.607
THE COST A HUNDRED AND WAS GOING

00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:16.541
TO BE IN A FEW YEARS HYDROGEN

00:26:16.608 --> 00:26:18.109
COULD END UP BEING A LOT MORE

00:26:18.176 --> 00:26:19.544
EXPENSIVE IT COULD BE CHEAPER

00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:20.712
BUT THE UP FRONT COST OF

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:21.579
ELECTRIC WE'RE WE'RE QUITE HIGH

00:26:21.646 --> 00:26:23.748
IN THEIR VIEW. AND AGAIN I DON'T

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:24.783
PRETEND TO BE AN EXPERT ON ALL

00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:27.485
THIS BUT- YOU KNOW WHEN THAT THE

00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:29.587
DECISION WE WANT TO DO IT MAKE

00:26:29.654 --> 00:26:31.323
IT A LOCAL LEVEL BASED ON AND

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:33.425
THE PRICING AND DYNAMICS OF THE

00:26:33.491 --> 00:26:35.193
MARKET AT THE TIME RATHER THAN.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.261
I MEAN WHAT WHAT MAKING A PRETTY

00:26:36.328 --> 00:26:37.629
BIG DECISION HERE ONE POINT FIVE

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:39.497
BILLION DOLLARS TO SAY. ELECTRIC

00:26:39.564 --> 00:26:41.366
SCHOOL BUSES THE WAY TO GO IN MY

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.901
UNDERSTANDING THE DEBATE WHEN IT

00:26:42.968 --> 00:26:44.569
COMES TO HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES

00:26:44.636 --> 00:26:46.638
SUCH AS BUSES IS THAT. IT'S NOT

00:26:46.705 --> 00:26:48.540
CLEAR WHICH TECHNOLOGIES BETTER

00:26:48.606 --> 00:26:51.810
WHICH ONE WILL BE MORE COST

00:26:51.876 --> 00:26:53.345
EFFECTIVE OVER THE LONG RUN. AND

00:26:53.411 --> 00:26:54.679
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS SORT

00:26:54.746 --> 00:26:56.081
OF. WHAT WERE THE DATA POINTS

00:26:56.147 --> 00:26:57.782
OTHER THAN SORT OF I GUESS THE

00:26:57.849 --> 00:26:59.784
COST ONE WHICH I'M NOT SURE I

00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:02.520
FULLY UNDERSTAND- YEAH YOU KNOW

00:27:02.587 --> 00:27:03.588
WHAT WERE THE REASONS THAT WE

00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:09.494
CHOSE ELECTRIC. MORNING INTERNET

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:11.596
AREA BERMAN FINANCE OKAY THERE I

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:14.599
DON'T- SO JUST ANSWER THAT

00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:16.434
QUESTION CENTER MAN THE WAY I

00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:18.536
THINK OF IT IS WE'RE REALLY

00:27:18.603 --> 00:27:19.738
TRYING TO BE AS CONSISTENT AS

00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:21.639
POSSIBLE ACROSS SEVERAL OF THE

00:27:21.706 --> 00:27:23.842
OTHER PROGRAMS BOTH- PROPOSALS

00:27:23.908 --> 00:27:26.211
THAT WERE DONE- THAT FOR GRANT

00:27:26.277 --> 00:27:28.346
PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE A.

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:31.549
R. B. AND- THE- ENERGY

00:27:31.616 --> 00:27:33.084
COMMISSION LAST YEAR AS WELL AS

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:34.519
PROPOSALS IN THIS CURRENT

00:27:34.586 --> 00:27:36.921
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT REALLY DO

00:27:36.988 --> 00:27:38.123
. HIGHLIGHTED MINISTRATIONS

00:27:38.189 --> 00:27:41.292
INTENT OVER ARCHING ON GOING AS

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:43.294
FAR DOWN THE ROAD AS ELECTRIC

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:44.496
VEHICLES AS WECAN AND YOU'RE

00:27:44.562 --> 00:27:46.297
SAYING THAT NOT JUST AND- YOU

00:27:46.364 --> 00:27:48.366
KNOW THE PUBLIC TRANSIT SECTOR-

00:27:48.433 --> 00:27:50.468
BUT ALL ACROSS RIGHT SEVERAL-

00:27:50.535 --> 00:27:53.271
INITIATIVES AND FOCUS ON ON.

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:56.241
ELECTRIFYING VEHICLES WHETHER

00:27:56.307 --> 00:27:57.575
THAT BE FLEET VEHICLES OR

00:27:57.642 --> 00:27:58.176
OTHERWISE. AND THAT'S REALLY

00:27:58.243 --> 00:28:01.880
MORE- THE LANDS THAT WAS USED-

00:28:01.946 --> 00:28:02.947
WHEN WE WERE CRAFTING THIS

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:05.216
PROPOSAL NOW THAT'S NOT TO SAY

00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:07.285
THAT WE ARE COMPLETELY UNAWARE-

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:08.353
CERTAINLY SOME OF THE CONCERNS

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.622
THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING- SOME OF

00:28:10.688 --> 00:28:11.890
THE YOU KNOW DIFFICULTIES

00:28:11.956 --> 00:28:13.124
PRACTICALLY WHETHER THAT'S

00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:15.393
BECAUSE OF THE DISTRCT AS- MAY

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.296
BE MORAL OR HAS. A LONGER ROUTE

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:20.231
THAN ONE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE-

00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:22.467
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:23.835
REALISTICALLY WE WILL KEEP WILL

00:28:23.902 --> 00:28:25.270
WE ARE ENGAGING CONVERSATIONS TO

00:28:25.336 --> 00:28:26.905
TALK ABOUT SOME WAYS THAT. NO

00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:28.606
THERE IF THERE ARE TWEAKS NEEDED

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:30.809
BUT AT THE MOMENT- THAT WAS THE

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:32.310
LENS THAT WAS USED FOR THIS

00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:35.513
PROPOSAL. AND WE HAVE A HAND

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.516
FROM THE L. A. SO BEFORE GOING

00:28:38.583 --> 00:28:40.118

QUESTION SENATOR MAN WE GET THIS

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:51.629
PART OF OUR REVIEW TOUGHEST

00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:53.832
DISTRICT IT BRINGS YOUR ELECTED

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:55.100
. AND CHARGING STATE MY LOOK AT

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:56.468
PREVIOUS PROGRAM. AND A FULL

00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:58.803
SIZE ELECTRIC BUS A FAIRLY HIGH

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:01.072
AND TRY STATE. A FOUR HUNDRED

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:02.540
DOLLAR FOR THE ELECTED SCHOOL

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:04.209
BUS FIFTY THOUSAND TRYING TO

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:06.111
STATION SEEMS TO BE. ABOUT WHAT

00:29:06.177 --> 00:29:07.378
THE MARK PROCESS RIGHT NOW ARE

00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:09.547
UNDER THOUGH THEY IS JUST DOWN.

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:11.449
THE COSTA TRANSIT MY PAY THEIR

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:14.052
IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM THE BUS

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:23.261
AND IT'S CHARGING FOR STRUCTURE. AND AS FAR AS THE BUST. WE ARE

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:25.296
. AND I AROUND WE DON'T OF ANY

00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:28.066
THE HAS TO IT LIKE US HYDROGEN

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:31.402
FUEL. BASED FOR SCHOOL THAT AS

00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:35.807
FAR AS WE KNOW ELECT. SCHOOL BUS

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:36.641
LIKE TO SCHOOL BUSES ARE THE

00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:39.077
ONLY KIND OF ZERO VEHICLE THAT

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:40.812
GONNA COMMERCIALLY FOR YOUR IN

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:43.348
RIGHT NOW. THAT'S VERY HELPFUL

00:29:43.414 --> 00:29:44.916
THERE ARE SOME OTHER. THAT ARE

00:29:44.983 --> 00:29:47.152
TO OUR JUST. THOSE CHECKS OF

00:29:47.218 --> 00:29:48.219
VEHICLES INCLUDING THE ONE THAT

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:50.221
WAS CREATED IN YEAR'S BY AND-

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:52.257
BUT- THAT I THINK WAS WHAT I

00:29:52.323 --> 00:29:54.459
CASE. TO DIMINISH MUST WHAT TYPE

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:57.428
OF THE- COULD BE FOR. IMPLEMENT

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:58.863
RIGHT NOW THAT'S VERY HELP HELP

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.632
ANSWERS ON- IF THERE ARE NO

00:30:00.698 --> 00:30:02.467
HYDROGEN FUEL CELL. THE THAN YOU

00:30:02.534 --> 00:30:03.134
REALLY PER ANYTHING I APPRECIATE

00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:04.302
ANSWER I DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:06.971
WE ARE CREATING A MARKET. AND

00:30:07.038 --> 00:30:07.839
WE'RE PUSHING OURSELVES ON A

00:30:07.906 --> 00:30:10.208
PATH WHERE IT RATHER THAN

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:11.843
LETTING THE MARKET SORT ITSELF

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.077
OUT- YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT ONE

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:14.379
THING THAT WAS STRIKING TO ME I

00:30:14.445 --> 00:30:17.048
RECENTLY VISITED UC IRVINE'S.

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:19.851
TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE. AND

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:21.085
ONE THING THEY TOLD ME WAS JUST

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:22.754
THAT IF WE TAKE ALL THE KNOWN

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.589
LITHIUM AND COBALT IN THE IN THE

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:26.691
WORLD. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MEET

00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:28.092
OUR ANYWHERE CLOSE TO A SMALL

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:29.761
FRACTION OF OUR OUR BATTERY

00:30:29.827 --> 00:30:31.095
NEEDS AND THAT WAS STRIKING TO

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:33.131
ME IN ADDITION TO THE PROBLEMS

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:34.666
OF WHAT WE DO WITH THESE

00:30:34.732 --> 00:30:36.668
BATTERIES WHEN THEY RUN OFF. AND

00:30:36.734 --> 00:30:38.670
I DO HAVE CONCERNS WERE PUSHING

00:30:38.736 --> 00:30:39.871
REALLY HARD IN THE ELECTRIC

00:30:39.938 --> 00:30:41.806
SPACE WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE

00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:44.242
LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR-

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:45.944
WHETHER THAT'S SUSTAINABLE BUT-

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.445
I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS AND

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.514
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU

SENATOR MENSEN RITUAL BOKE. I

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.918
JUST HAVE TO REACH AT ECHO

00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:55.753
SENATOR MEN'S- COMMENTS THIS

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.522
MORNING BECAUSE I ACTUALLY HAVE

00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:59.924
HAD THE SAME CONCERNS- THAT YOU

00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:02.360
JUST EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:03.995
SHARING- IN ASKING THOSE

00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:06.931
QUESTIONS. I'M I ALSO WANTED TO

00:31:06.998 --> 00:31:08.433
SORT OF ASK A QUESTION WITH

00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:12.303
REGARDS TO- THE- ELECTRIC READ

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.539
AND THE ABILITY FOR US TO BE

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:15.773
ABLE TO. ASK THE SAME THESE

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.442
pBUSES ARE BE ABLE TO TRUST THEM

00:31:17.508 --> 00:31:19.210
AND WHAT THE COST WILL BE

00:31:19.277 --> 00:31:20.578
EVENTUALLY FOR THE SCHOOL

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:21.045
DISTRICTS IN THE LOCAL

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:23.715
COMMUNITIES AND JUST AS- JUST IN

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:25.450
GENERAL- IF WE TAKE INTO

00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:27.185
CONSIDERATION ABOUT THE ELECTRIC

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:33.858
RATE AND OUR ABILITY TO- TO

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:35.426
SUPPORT OUR BUSES. AND STEPPED

00:31:35.493 --> 00:31:40.031
VOTER- THAT WE PROBABLY BE FOUR-

00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:42.700
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINE- GOOD

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:43.968
MORNING AGAIN IN A AN APARTMENT

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:46.237
OF FINANCE I THINK AS FAR AS

00:31:46.304 --> 00:31:47.972
THAT QUESTION- SENSE

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:50.375
UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE MORE-

00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:52.744
TRANSPORTATION- KIND OF

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.412
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES LIKE THAT

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:56.948
FALL OUTSIDE OF MY AREA AND MY

00:31:57.015 --> 00:31:58.783
COLLEAGUE LINA'S AREA WITH

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.184
EDUCATION I DON'T KNOW THAT I

00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:01.486
COULD SPEAK WITH A WHOLE LOT OF

00:32:01.552 --> 00:32:03.788
EXPERTISE ON THE SUBJECT- I DO

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:06.691
KNOW. RIGHT EVEN THOSE ARE VALID

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:07.859
QUESTIONS CONCERNS I THINK FROM

00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:09.761
MINISTRATIONS PERSPECTIVE WE I

00:32:09.827 --> 00:32:11.162
LOOK AT IT AS WHERE YOU'RE

00:32:11.229 --> 00:32:12.463
REALLY TRYING TO PLAY THE LONG

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.732
GAME IN TERMS OF SETTING- THE

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:16.601
STATE UP FOR SUCCESS BASED YOU

00:32:16.668 --> 00:32:18.369
KNOW CONVERTING THERE STILL BY

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:19.904
CONVERTING DIESELS TO ELECTRIC

00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:21.272
ZERO EMISSIONS THERE ARE STILL

00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:23.308
SO MANY DIESEL BUSES AND CAN USE

00:32:23.374 --> 00:32:24.876
INSERT IN CIRCULATION IN THE

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:26.511
STATE AND THAT HAS BOTH YOU KNOW

00:32:26.577 --> 00:32:28.246
REAL IMPACTS FOR. THE HEALTH OF

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:30.848
STUDENTS AS WELL AS THE HEALTH

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:31.549
OF THE ENVIRONMENT OBVIOUSLY-

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:33.251
AND SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT-

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:35.353
PRIORITIZING THAT- AND

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.854
RECOGNIZING AT THE SAME TIME

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:39.190
THAT OUR PARTNERS- AT THE

00:32:39.257 --> 00:32:41.292
DIFFERENT AGENCIES WHETHER IT'S-

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.227
THEIR RESOURCES BOARD OR WHOEVER

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:45.229
ELSE IN THAT SPACE OF REALIZING

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:47.432
THAT OUR PARTNERS TO HAVE A BIG

00:32:47.498 --> 00:32:48.466
TASK AHEAD OF THEM WHEN IT COMES

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:50.835
TO- COMBATING SOME OF THOSE

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:52.170
OTHER CONCERNS WHETHER IT BE

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:53.638
INFRASTRUCTURE OR LIKE YOU SAID

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:56.074
COSTS TO. SCHOOL DISTRICTS I

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.375
WOULD NOTE THAT YOU KNOW OUR

00:32:57.442 --> 00:32:59.010
HOPE OR INTENT WITH THIS

00:32:59.077 --> 00:33:00.845
PROPOSAL IS THAT- IN THE LONG

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:02.080
TERM BECAUSE DIESEL BUSES CAN BE

00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:05.917
SO MUCH ORE COSTLY TO MAINTAIN-

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:07.251
THAT IN THE LONG TERM SCHOOLS

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:09.987
WOULD SEE SAVINGS FROM FROM AS A

00:33:10.054 --> 00:33:11.356
RESULT OF- ELECTRIFYING THEIR

00:33:11.422 --> 00:33:13.291
FLEETS AND THAT WAS REALLY A LOT

00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:14.158
OF THINKING BEHIND BEING ABLE TO

00:33:14.225 --> 00:33:16.394
PAY THE FULL COST OF THE BUS OF

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:18.096
ELECTRIC BUS. CONVERSION IN THIS

00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:20.832
CASE SUCH THAT- THE STATE IS

00:33:20.898 --> 00:33:22.900
TAKING THE BRUNT OF THAT BURDEN

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:24.469
TO PROVIDE THE BUS AND THEN THE

00:33:24.535 --> 00:33:26.504
DISTRICT COULD REALIZE COST

00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:27.939
SAVINGS FROM THE OTHER PIECES OF

00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:29.240
OWNING ELECTRIC BUS ROUTES THE

00:33:29.307 --> 00:33:31.776
DIESEL BUS- IN IN THE MORNING

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:35.179
HERE- LONG TERM SO. THAT'S

00:33:35.246 --> 00:33:36.614
HELPFUL I DON'T KNOW IF MY

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:37.482
COLLEAGUE AT THE ALIENS ANYTHING

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:44.689
ELSE AT ALL I WAS JUST GONNA SAY. MISTER IDEA DID VERY WELL WITH

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:47.692
HAVE HAVING LIMIT DECKS FOR. AND

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:50.395
I'M AND PRE MR IT IT IT IT THE

00:33:50.461 --> 00:33:51.963
YOUR YOUR FEE ON THAT I THINK. I

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:53.998
THINK WHAT I'M GOING BACK TO IS

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:57.802
BASICALLY. AS MY COLLEAGUE

00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:00.338
STATED EARLIER WE ARE DIRECTING

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:02.073
THESE FUNDS TO WHAT WE WOULD

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.508
LIKE TO ENVISIONED THOUGH I THE

00:34:03.574 --> 00:34:06.677
INTENT AYE AT THE MERIT OF IT IS

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:08.646
. EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO I'M

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.148
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:11.716
MAYBE PERHAPS EVEN A LITTLE

00:34:11.783 --> 00:34:14.419
FLEXIBILITY IN IN THE- IN

00:34:14.485 --> 00:34:14.952
ALLOWING OUR LOCAL SCHOOL

00:34:15.019 --> 00:34:17.388
DISTRICTS DECIDE. HOW TO HOW TO

00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:20.091
PROCEED WITH AB ACQUIRING THESE

00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:21.926
VEHICLES WHAT WOULD BE BEST FOR

00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:24.896
THEM LOCALLY- IN WHETHER OR NOT

00:34:24.962 --> 00:34:26.197
IT'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:28.099
ELECTRIC BUS OR IF IT IS THEIR

00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:33.004
EMISSIONS- BUS- SCENARIO SO.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.338
THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I'M

00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:36.774
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS TO MAYBE

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:37.975
PERHAPS GIVING A LITTLE

00:34:38.042 --> 00:34:41.245
FLEXIBILITY TO OUR LOCAL SCHOOL

00:34:41.312 --> 00:34:44.715
WOULD WORK BEST BOTH A- AND-

00:34:44.782 --> 00:34:46.984
WITH INFRASTRUCTURE- WITHIN

00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:49.387
THEIR THEIR- THEIR CAPACITIES

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:51.456
WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY SO THAT'S

00:34:51.522 --> 00:34:53.024
JUST THE CONCERN THAT I AM

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.093
HAVING- WITH REGARDS TO SAY

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.395
COULD THIS IS RICHARD WITH THIS

00:34:57.462 --> 00:34:59.964
IS WHAT WE'RE GIVING YOU THIS IS

00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:00.631
WHAT WE HAVE AND JUST MAKING A

00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:01.766
VERY. LEAN YOU'RE A VERY

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.261
PROPOSED APPLICATION THIS

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:25.863

IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ALL

00:39:33.637 --> 00:39:34.572
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED

00:39:34.638 --> 00:39:36.207
TO SERVE UNIVERSAL MEALS AND FOR

00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:37.775
UNIVERSAL MEALS WE NEED

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:39.877
PROVIDING ONE FREE BREAKFAST AND

00:39:39.944 --> 00:39:41.612

ANY STUDENT AT RISK THAT IS

00:39:43.347 --> 00:39:45.149
REQUESTING A MEAL. SO THAT IS ON

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:47.017
AUGMENTATION- THE REMAINDER OF

00:39:47.084 --> 00:39:48.486
MY COMMENTS REALLY FOCUS ON THE

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:49.920
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FIND

00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:50.654
ADDITIONAL KITCHEN

00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:53.457
INFRASTRUCTURE IN TRAINING

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.626
GRANTS. ON THIS POLLS WILL BE.

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:56.994
THE LEGISLATURE UP A REDUCED

00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:58.763
AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:39:58.829 --> 00:40:00.164
MILLION DOLLARS FOR ADDITIONAL

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:01.065
KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE IN

00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:02.933
TRAINING GRANTS. THIS IS ONE

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.335
THIRD OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:05.870
AMOUNT BUT IT MATCHES THE AMOUNT

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:07.905
THAT WAS PROVIDED IN TWENTY ONE

00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:09.940
TWENTY TWO. THE PRIMARY REASON

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:11.275
THAT WE RECOMMEND APPROVING A

00:40:11.342 --> 00:40:12.743
REDUCED AMOUNT IS BECAUSE THE

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.145
STATE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A

00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:15.946
CLEAR SENSE AS TO THE TOTAL COST

00:40:16.013 --> 00:40:16.981
OF KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE

00:40:17.047 --> 00:40:18.349
UPGRADES. ASSOCIATED WITH

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:20.251
UNIVERSAL MEALS AT THIS TIME

00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:21.619
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE STATE

00:40:21.685 --> 00:40:23.487
ALREADY PROVIDED FUNDING FOR THE

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:25.589
SAME ACTIVITIES IN THE TWENTY

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:26.690
ONE TWENTY TWO PERCENT. WE

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:28.259
EXPECT THAT SOME ADDITIONAL

00:40:28.325 --> 00:40:29.660
INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE

00:40:29.727 --> 00:40:32.663
AFTER JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.330
TWENTY THREE EIGHT WHICH IS WHEN

00:40:33.397 --> 00:40:34.865
ELOISE MUST REPORT HOW IT USED

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:36.801
THE FIRST ROUND OF FINDING. WE

00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:38.936
ALSO RECOMMEND PRIORITIZING CAN

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:40.070
THIS FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTING

00:40:40.137 --> 00:40:42.740
UNIVERSAL MEALS RATHER THAN

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:44.408
INCORPORATION OF FRESH FOODS-

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:46.377
SCRATCH COOKING. SCHOOLS WILL

00:40:46.443 --> 00:40:48.612
HAVE TO MANAGE A VARIETY OF NEAR

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.181
TERM CHALLENGES FOR THEIR SCHOOL

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:51.782
INTERESTING PROGRAMS INCLUDING

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:53.717
UNIVERSAL MEALS STAFFING

00:40:53.784 --> 00:40:55.686
SHORTAGES AND INCREASED COSTS

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:57.388
FOR FOOD AND EQUIPMENT. FOR

00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:58.556
THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT

00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:00.391
EDUCATIONAL FUNDING FOR SCRATCH

00:41:00.457 --> 00:41:01.659
COOKING TO BE SOMEWHAT PREMATURE

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:03.260
AT THIS TIME. WE THINK THE

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:04.862
LEGISLATURE COULD REVISIT

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:06.630
FUNDING FOR BOTH UNIVERSAL MEALS

00:41:06.697 --> 00:41:08.098
AND SCRATCH COOKING IN FUTURE

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:09.900
YEARS WANTS MORE INFORMATION

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:11.569
ABOUT THE DEMAND AND THE USE OF

00:41:11.635 --> 00:41:13.404
THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO GRANTS

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.973
BECOME AVAILABLE. LASTLY THE

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.241
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:19.009
MODIFYING THE FORMULA FOR THE

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:20.578
GRANTS TO TARGET DISTRICTS THAT

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:22.313
ARE MOST IMPACTED BY UNIVERSAL

00:41:22.379 --> 00:41:24.515
MEALS. THE GOVERNOR'S COALS ALL

00:41:24.582 --> 00:41:26.450
ALLOCATE A PORTION OF FUNDING TO

00:41:26.517 --> 00:41:28.285
DISTRICTS WITH AT LEAST 30% OF

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:30.387
STUDENTS QUALIFYING FOR FREE OR

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:32.122
REDUCED PRICE MEALS. THIS

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:34.525
APPROACH LIKELY EXCLUDES SOME

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:35.359
DISTRICTS THAT WILL NEED TO

00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:37.228
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE CAPACITY

00:41:37.294 --> 00:41:38.929
TO SERVE UNIVERSAL MEALS.

00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:40.431
SPECIFICALLY THOSE THAT

00:41:40.497 --> 00:41:42.032
CURRENTLY DO NOT OFFER A SCHOOL

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:43.901
LUNCH AND OR SCHOOL BREAKFAST.

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:45.603
AND THOSE WITH LOWER SHARES OF

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.605
STUDENTS QUALIFYING FOR FREE OR

00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:49.673
REDUCEDPRICE MEALS. TO ENSURE A

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.075
SMOOTHER IMPLEMENTATION THE

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:55.779
LEGISLATURE. COULD CONSIDER

00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:56.413
ALLOCATING FUNDING BASED ON SOME

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.042
WHY THAT WAS THE CASE FOR MOST

00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:00.944
OF LAST YEAR SCHOOL YEAR. I WAS

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:02.245
BECAUSE OF STAFFING AND A LACK

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:04.514
LACK OF KITCHEN RESOURCES. THIS

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:05.348
YEAR I'M TOLD IT'S GOTTEN A

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:07.016
LITTLE BETTER OCCASIONALLY THEY

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:09.385
HAVE PIZZA OR SOME OTHER OPTION

00:58:09.452 --> 00:58:10.954
BUT IT'S- BY AND LARGE THE SAME

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:12.989
. AND SO I GUESS TO FOLLOW UP ON

00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:15.258
ON SENATOR- SHOWBOATS QUESTION.

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:17.260
WHY ADD MORE MONEY WHEN THERE'S

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:19.229
CLEARLY AT LET IT SEEMS IN AND

00:58:19.295 --> 00:58:20.496
THIS SEEMS TO BE AT I'VE MAYBE I

00:58:20.563 --> 00:58:21.464
SHOULD ADD PHRASES IN THE FORM

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:25.235
OF A QUESTION. IT IS MY-

00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:27.403
CHILDREN'S EXPERIENCE. UNIQUE OR

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:28.605
IS THAT SOMETHING WE'RE SEEING

00:58:28.671 --> 00:58:30.840
IS- BOTTLENECK. AND IN TALKING

00:58:30.907 --> 00:58:31.708
WITH SOME DIFFERENT TEACHERS

00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:33.343
GROUPS OUT THERE. AND SCHOOL

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:35.778
WORKERS. IT DAVE EXPRESSED ME

00:58:35.845 --> 00:58:36.579
SOME SIMILAR CONCERNS THAT THERE

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:38.014
IS A BOTTLENECK. THERE'S NOT

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:39.382
ENOUGH STAFF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:41.951
KITCHEN RESOURCES. TO PREPARE

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:43.419
THE TYPES OF MEALS THAT WE'D

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:44.621
LIKE TO HAVE FOR UNIVERSAL

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:46.222
MEALS. AND SO I APPLAUD THIS

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:47.323
PROGRAM I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:48.791
GREAT BUT OUR OUR THE RESOURCES

00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:51.127
THERE AND IF TO REALLY KIND OF

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:53.696
MAKE THIS- YOU KNOW HOLISTIC IN

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:54.330
THE WAYS THAT YOU WERE

00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:56.566
ENVISIONING. AND IF NOT THEN WHY

00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:57.533
NOT DEFAULT TO SOME OF THE

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.235
ALEJO'S RIET RECOMMENDATIONS OF

00:58:59.302 --> 00:59:00.703
SCALING IT BACK TO THOSE ALLEY

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:03.940
AS- THAT NEED IT THE MOST RATHER

00:59:04.007 --> 00:59:05.708
THAN MAKING IT TRULY UNIVERSAL-

00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:07.577
AND I'M I'M ALL IN FAVOR

00:59:07.644 --> 00:59:08.278
UNIVERSAL LUNCHES UNIVERSAL

00:59:08.344 --> 00:59:10.480
MEALS I THINK THIS IMPORTANT-

00:59:10.546 --> 00:59:12.582
MORAL SIGNAL BUT BUT- IF WE

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:14.384
CAN'T WRAP THIS UP. AND ALSO WE

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:15.885
CAN'T SUSTAIN THE STAFF THAT WE

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:17.987
NEED TO REALLY KEEP IT GOING.

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:20.123
OVER ON AN ONGOING BASIS- YOU

00:59:20.189 --> 00:59:21.357
KNOW IF WERE USING ONE TIME

00:59:21.424 --> 00:59:22.358
FUNDS WOULDN'T IT MAKE MORE

00:59:22.425 --> 00:59:26.963
SENSE. TO PUT IN THOSE DISTRICTS

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:28.598
THAT NEED IT THE MOST- SURE SO I

00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:30.900
GUESS I GUESS I WOULD I WOULD.

00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:34.504
GO BACK TO- MY PREVIOUS POINT-

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:35.805
YOU KNOW BY BY MAKING THOSE

00:59:35.872 --> 00:59:38.374
CHANGES- YOU KNOW OFF OF THE-

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:40.443
TWENTY. TWENTY ONE KITCHEN

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.645
INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING- WE ARE

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:44.647
TRYING TO MAKE THIS YOU KNOW

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:48.051
FUNDING. AVAILABLE ADD AS MANY

00:59:48.117 --> 00:59:49.953
ELEAZAR POSSIBLE INCLUDING YOU

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:52.956
KNOW THE ONES THE ONES THAT WE

00:59:53.022 --> 00:59:54.891
NEED IT MOST- I THINK IN

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:58.361
RESPONSE- YOU KNOW SORT OF. WHAT

00:59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.296
ABOUT MAKING A KIND OF HOLISTIC

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:01.931
YOU KNOW IMPROVEMENT AS WE GO

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:05.702
TOWARDS UNIVERSAL MEALS- I THINK

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.837
THAT IS YOU KNOW ONE OF OUR

01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:09.005
INTENTIONS AND ONE OF THE

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.606
REASONS THAT WE HAVE ALSO ADDED

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:13.042
THIS FUNDING FOR- SCRATCH

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:15.078
COOKING I THINK WE SORT OF SEE

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:17.213
THIS AS AN IMPORTANT OWNER OF

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.215
UNIVERSAL MEALS RIGHT- YEAH

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:22.251
INCREASING. THE QUALITY OF MEALS

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:23.486
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:27.623
STEP- IN TERMS OF JUST

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:31.694
INCREASING THE- PARTICIPATION- I

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.663
THINK ONE OF OUR HOPES AND

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:36.132
INTENTIONS. WITH THIS AS WELL

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:37.900
RIGHT IS INCREASING THE QUALITY

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:39.702
MEALS INCREASING THE

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:43.906
PARTICIPATION- YEAH WILL WILL

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:47.577
INCREASE B. THE REVENUE THAT-

01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:49.979
YEAH ELEAZER WILLS ARE ABLE TO

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:51.514
GENERATE FROM THIS- I THINK

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.316
WE'VE RELEASE. YOU KNOW

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:56.085
ANECDOTALLY- OF SCHOOLS THAT IT

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:59.355
GOT KIND OF EXPANDED OR STOOD UP

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:00.790
PROGRAMS YEAH. THE BREAKFAST

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:03.259
PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:06.963
BEING ABLE TO- YOU KNOW USED

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:08.131
USED ADDITIONAL REVENUE

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:09.365
GENERATED FROM INCREASED

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:12.168
PARTICIPATION TO INCREASE- STAFF

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:16.005
HOURS. BUT I GUESS JUST A FOLLOW

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.006
UP AND THEN I LIKE TO HEAR FROM

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:18.374
LA- I'M I MEAN WHAT YOU'RE

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.143
TALKING ABOUT IS USING ONE TIME

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:22.378
FUNDING IN THE HOPES OF

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:25.748
JUMPSTARTING ONGOING FUNDING- I

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:27.083
MEAN AGAIN I PLUGGED THE GOAL

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.484
HERE BUT BUT IF WE'RE GONNA TALK

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:29.719
ABOUT ONGOING FUNDING AND A

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:31.487
PERMANENT SHIFT. IN HOW WE

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:34.190
PROVIDE MEALS. LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:36.159
THAT IN THE CLASS- BUT LETS. YOU

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:37.093
KNOW TO ME IT SEEMS

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.795
INAPPROPRIATE TO BE USING ONE

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.797
TIME FUNDING. WHEN WE KNOW THAT

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:41.864
THEIR BOTTLENECKS THAT WILL

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:43.533
REQUIRE ONGOING FUNDING TO

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:46.002
ADDRESS I MEAN. AGAIN I DON'T

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.869
KNOW HOW YOU NEED MY KIDS

01:01:46.936 --> 01:01:48.771
EXPERIENCES BUT- I'M NOT I'M

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:49.672
JUST NOT HEARING IT IS NOT

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:52.442
UNIQUE. AND SO WOULDN'T IT BE

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:54.410
BETTER IN IN THE FACE OF

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:56.045
CONSTRAINED RESOURCES TO. THE

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:58.114
SCALE THIS TO THE SCHOOL ELEAZAR

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:00.883
SCHOOLS THAT NEED IT THE MOST IN

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.085
THE WAY THE L. A. O. HAS ITS

01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:04.187
PROPOSED- YOU KNOW AND I GUESS

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:05.154
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:07.523
WHAT. HOW MUCH IS FOUR HUNDRED

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:09.158
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO GET US

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:10.827
TO CENTER TOWBOATS QUESTION.

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:12.495
WHAT DOES THAT GET US AS FAR AS

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.263
KITCHEN UPGRADES AS FAR AS

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.832
STAFFING INCREASES AS FAR AS-

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:18.134
MEALS. YOU KNOW IF THE GOAL HERE

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.402
IS TO CREATE SOMETHING MORE

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:21.204
SUSTAINABLE I I'D BE INTERESTED

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:22.472
IN KNOWING SOARED HOW MANY

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:24.540
KITCHENS THIS THAT UPGRADE- HOW

01:02:24.607 --> 01:02:26.342
MUCH STAFF DOES THAT GET US. OUT

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:27.477
HOW MANY SCHOOLS CAN ACTUALLY

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:32.415
GET TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW GOOD.

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:41.591
THINK YOUR COMMENT SPEAKS TO

01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:42.525
THEIR NUMBER BUT THE CONCERNS

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:43.893
THAT WE RAISED IN OUR TESTIMONY

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.462
ENACT ANALYSIS AS WELL- ARE

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:47.797
UNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION IS I

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:49.065
DISTRICTS REALLY ARE STARTING IN

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:50.466
VERY DIFFERENT STARTING POINTS.

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:52.135
WHEN IT COMES TO UNIVERSAL MEALS

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:53.503
YOU HAVE SOME DISTRICTS THAT

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:55.071
MEET NOT HAVE A VERY ROBUST

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:55.805
SCHOOL LUNCH AND SCHOOL

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:57.773
BREAKFAST- PROGRAM AND THEY WILL

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.942
BE EXPECTED TO SERVE OR BE ABLE

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:00.910
TO SERVE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE

01:03:00.977 --> 01:03:02.111
TESTING CAMILLE'S FROM EITHER

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:04.480
LUNCH OR BREAKFAST. AND SO I

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:06.782
THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST-%

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:08.584
CONCERNS OVER HOW AND THE FUNDS

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:09.952
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:12.054
PROPOSING IS BEING TARGETED AND

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.256
WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE IT

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:14.690
BEING TARGETED BASED OFF OF SOME

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:16.425
MEASURE OF CAPACITY NEED. TO

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:17.860
SORT OF ACCOUNT FOR THOSE I

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:19.896
DISTRICTS THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE A

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:21.731
ROBUST. SCHOOL SCHOOL MEAL

01:03:21.797 --> 01:03:23.499
PROGRAM IT WILL NEED TO EXPAND

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:25.101
IT SIGNIFICANTLY TO MEET THE NEW

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:28.337
C. REQUIREMENTS STARTING IN

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:29.372
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND THE

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:30.373
OTHER THING WE WANT TO MENTION

01:03:30.439 --> 01:03:31.774
IS ANYTHING. BOTH YOU ARE

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:33.075
SENATOR MAN AND SENATOR CHOI

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:34.277
BOGUE SORT OF SPOKE TO LAST IS

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:36.646
WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE A

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:37.313
DEMAND I UNDERSTAND OF WHAT THE

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.382
DEMAND IS FOR KITCHEN

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:40.349
INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:41.717
ASSOCIATED WITH UNIVERSAL MEALS.

01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:43.920
I THINK WE HAVE A SENSE AS TO

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:45.788
WHAT- IT DISTRICTS. A FAIR

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:47.590
NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL TEACHING

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:48.891
RESOURCES TO NEED ADDITIONAL

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.826
NEEDS BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:52.195
HAVE A SENSE AS TO WHETHER OR

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:53.629
NOT THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:55.431
MILLION WILL MEET THAT NEED WILL

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.166
EXCEED THAT NEED. AND SO-

01:03:57.233 --> 01:03:58.734
RECOMMENDATION WAS REALLY TO

01:03:58.801 --> 01:03:59.869

INFORMATION COMES AVAILABLE AND-

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:06.142
BASED OFF- AND MYSTERIES ELS-

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:08.044
TESTIMONY FROM CD IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:08.778
THERE SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:10.079
INFORMATION THAT WILL BE MADE

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:11.747
AVAILABLE IN MID MARCH TO SORT

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:13.449
OF HELP GAUGE WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.283
FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.851
PROPOSED. WHAT KIND OF S. THAT

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.753
NEEDS SOME OF THAT NEED FOR AN

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:25.795
ADDITIONAL. TEACHING

01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:26.696
INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES. I THINK

01:04:26.762 --> 01:04:29.465
I'M JUST TRYING TO. ABOUT THE

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:30.700
REASON WE PROPOSE- THE LET

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:31.968
PROVIDE WOULD DO AMOUNT REALLY

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:33.436
HELP STABILIZE THE SYSTEM WHEN

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:35.404
IT TO WILL WE RECKON THAT THIS

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:37.173
ARE COUNTING LOT OF. FACTORS

01:07:56.505 --> 01:07:58.207
THAT SCHOOLS HAVE A VARIETY OF

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:17.092
TO NAME A FEW. WE THINK THE

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:18.194
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH OF

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.162
PROVIDING RESTRICTED FUNDING FOR

FAST FURTHERMORE TO DATE HAS

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:31.707
BEEN VERY LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:32.808
IMPACT OF HAVING MORE

SUPPORT ENGLISH LEARNERS BECAUSE

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:01.303
OF THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND TO

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:02.505

PROGRAMS. OKAY THAT'S MUCH MORE

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:54.269
HELPFUL THAT CLARIFICATION RIGHT

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:55.303
THERE WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:58.673
BECAUSE- AND IT'S INTERESTING

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:01.109
BECAUSE I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT. I

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:02.811
WOULD BE VERY VERY HIGH

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:04.746
DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR THAT ARE

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:06.581
FUNDING FOR OUR UNDUPLICATED

01:18:06.648 --> 01:18:07.783
CHILDREN SPECIFICALLY ARE

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:08.817
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS WOULD

01:18:08.884 --> 01:18:10.986
NOT BE RECEIVING MATERIALS BOTH

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:13.989
TO LEARN ENGLISH AND TO ALSO

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:16.191
SUPPORT THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:17.893
IN THE CLASSROOM AS A FORMER

01:18:17.959 --> 01:18:20.362

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:25.834
FACILITATED BOOKS FOR BOTH IN

01:18:25.901 --> 01:18:27.536
BOTH LANGUAGES TO SUPPORT THEIR

01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:29.171
LEARNING PROCESS ONE OF THE

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:30.138
REASONS WHY I'VE BEEN ALWAYS AN

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:32.641
ADVOCATE OF MAKING SURE THAT- I

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:36.211
HAVE BEEN OPENLY AN ADVOCATE OF-

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:37.412
TEACHING CHILDREN IN THEIR

01:18:37.479 --> 01:18:40.549
PRIMARY LANGUAGE- THE COR

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:44.553
CONTENT COR- DISCOUNTED WHILE

01:18:44.619 --> 01:18:45.987
THEY LEARN ENGLISH SO THAT THEY

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.689
DON'T FALL BEHIND ACADEMICALLY.

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:50.725
SO JUST WENT OUT AND THEN LAST

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:53.061
QUESTION HERE- IF THE DEPARTMENT

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:54.629

01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:56.698

CAN IMPACT AREAS ACADEMIC

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.207

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.610

THAT IF OUR SCHOOLS. ARE NOT

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:30.859
UTILIZING FUNDING TO SUPPORT

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:33.461
LITERACY PROGRAMS THAT COME

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:35.230
SPECIFICALLY BASED ON OUR

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:36.998
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE NEED TO

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:38.767
WHAT TYPEOF CLUSTER AS WE NEED

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:39.968
TO CREATE TO SUPPORT OUR ENGLISH

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:41.603
LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND THAT MEANS

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.738
HAVING- BOOKS IN THEIR PRIMARY

01:20:43.805 --> 01:20:45.840
LANGUAGE WITH THE EXTRA FUNDING

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:47.809
THAT WE ALREADY PROVIDE. THERE

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:49.010
ARE HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE

01:20:49.077 --> 01:20:50.745
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.581
THIRTEENTH I BELIEVE WHEN THERE

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:57.252
WAS A- THAT THE FORMULA- WAS

01:20:57.319 --> 01:20:59.754
REVISED I'M SORRY WAS REVISED

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:03.091
REVISED- THEN WE'RE IN WE ARE IN

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:04.259
TROUBLE AND I WOULD HIGHLY

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:06.962
RECOMMEND THAT WE- ARE LOCAL-

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.597
EDUCATIONAL. AGENCIES DEFINITELY

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:12.133
LOOK INTO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.769
BECAUSE I. MY SPEAR MY SPACE- IN

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:16.905
IN WOULD HAVE IN THE SCHOOL TO

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:18.373
PROVIDE A WORKING WITH. THEY'VE

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.408
BEEN VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL IN

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:22.177
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:24.212
MULTI LINGUAL OF BOOKS IN THE

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:25.814

MAKE A CLOSING COMMENT AND I WAS

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:39.995
MAKING A- A SNARKY OFF THE MY

01:21:40.061 --> 01:21:42.063
COMMENT. WITH REGARD TO THE

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:44.532
QUESTION. OF FINANCES TO WHETHER

01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:47.002
THEY AGREED WITH THE L. A. WE-

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:49.037
ADVISING US TO REJECT THE-

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:50.505
RECOMMENDATION THAT I WAS SURE

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:52.974
THEY DISAGREED ARM. BUT I THINK

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:55.410
THA. THIS DISCUSSION HAS BEEN

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:57.445
REALLY ILLUSTRATIVE. BECAUSE I

01:21:57.512 --> 01:22:00.849
THINK CENTER MAN ARTICULATELY.

01:22:00.915 --> 01:22:03.084
OUTLINED THE NEED FOR THIS AND

01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:05.220
THEN TO WHAT IT WORKS AGAINST

01:22:05.287 --> 01:22:07.522
AND I THINK SENATOR OCHO BOGUE.

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:09.891
AGREED BUT JUST SAID IS THIS THE

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.993
APPROPRIATE FUNDING SOURCE FROM

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.596
OTHER OTHER PLACES TO DO IT. AND

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:17.065
WAIT FOR A WAY. HAD THE BENEFIT

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:19.200
OF THE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATION

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:20.468

SEE THE FULL REPORT AND TAKING A

01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:28.343
LOOK AT IT. AND SO I THINK THE

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.679
NET RESULT OF ALL THIS IS. IS

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.580

APPROPRIATE SOURCE TO MAKE SURE

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:42.123
THAT WE HAVE THIS AND I THINK

01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:43.591

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:04.752
MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT. AND THEN

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:07.889
ASK A QUESTION THAT IS PROBABLY

01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:09.490
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:15.663
BUT ARM WE HAVE I THINK THREE

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:18.232
OUR SCHOOLS IN THE STATE THE

01:27:18.299 --> 01:27:20.802
DOOR SPECIAL SCHOOLS DIAGNOSTIC

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:24.572
CENTERS OF. AND THEY ARE LISTED

01:27:24.639 --> 01:27:26.975
IN OUR AGENDA PACKET AND WHAT'S

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:28.142
INTERESTING IS THEY DON'T

01:27:28.209 --> 01:27:30.044
USUALLY COME IN FRONT OF THIS-

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:31.412
COMMITTEE THEY'RE USUALLY VERY

01:27:31.479 --> 01:27:34.449
DEEPLY IN THE BUDGET AND- JUST

01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:38.853
RENEWED EVERY YEAR. AND EXCEPT

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.355
FOR OUR ITEMS LIKE THIS WE

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:41.756
WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT THEM AND I

01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:43.358
ASKED THAT IT BE ELEVATED FOR

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:45.493
DISCUSSION SO THAT WE ACTUALLY

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:49.464
HAVE IN OUR CHEN. OF THE SCHOOLS

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:51.833
IN A RELATIVE THING AND WE HAD A

01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:54.102
VERY HEARTWARMING STORY ABOUT

01:27:54.168 --> 01:27:56.004
THE SUCCESSFUL SPORTS TEAM OUT

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:57.805
OF RIVERSIDE FROM ONE OF THE

01:27:57.872 --> 01:28:00.174
SCHOOLS. ARE THAT REALLY SHOWS

01:28:00.241 --> 01:28:01.576
THAT THEY'RE JUST A VITAL PART

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:05.146
OF OUR- OF OUR LIFE AND OUR

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:07.281
EDUCATIONAL CULTURE. AND SO I

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:09.083
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:11.853
HAVE OUR EYES ON IT JUST TO MAKE

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:13.187
SURE THAT. THE TERROR ADEQUATELY

01:28:13.254 --> 01:28:16.290
FUNDED AND ADEQUATELY RESOURCE

01:28:16.357 --> 01:28:18.092
AND THAT WE HAVE SOME MEASURE OF

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:20.395
OVERSIGHT OVER THE SUCCESS OF

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:22.630
THESE INSTITUTIONS. AND SO THAT

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:24.232
IS THE REASON IT'S HERE EVEN

01:28:24.298 --> 01:28:26.167
THOUGH IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE IT'S

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:30.304
AN OBSCURE. ARE- ITEM IN IT A.

01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:32.373
N. G. THIS IS SOMETIMES THE

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.142
ITEMS SUCH AS THE ONE IN FRONT

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:36.477
OF US. ON THE MODERNIZATION

01:28:36.544 --> 01:28:38.346
PROJECT ON CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT

01:28:38.413 --> 01:28:39.814
PROGRAMS AND YOU CAN'T TELL IF

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:41.683
THEY'RE GOING TO BE REACHED A

01:28:41.749 --> 01:28:42.884
WORK. OR IF THEY GET THERE BUT I

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:45.053
THINK THIS IS OUR STATEMENT OF

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:46.087
SAYING THAT THEY'RE VERY

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:47.889
IMPORTANT AND WE HOPE THAT THEY

01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:50.091
ARE REACHED AND WE- WE HOPE THAT

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:52.126
THAT THAT THERE IS DISCUSSION IT

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:53.027
IS A PRIORITY FOR THE

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:54.929
INSTITUTIONS OF STATE GOVERNMENT

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.764
THAT WOULD DEAL WITH THIS. MY

01:28:56.831 --> 01:29:01.235
ONE QUESTION IS PROBABLY FOR THE

01:29:01.302 --> 01:29:04.539
- DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. IS

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:06.674
REALLY WHAT RESOURCES ARE

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:08.142
AVAILABLE TO THE STATE SPECIAL

01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:09.977
SCHOOLS FOR EXTRACURRICULAR

01:29:10.044 --> 01:29:11.979
ACTIVITIES IS THERE ARE COMMON

01:29:12.046 --> 01:29:14.382
FUND. THEY CAN TAP INTO FOR

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:16.484
SPORTS OR OTHER EXTRACURRICULAR

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:18.286
ACTIVITIES BECAUSE- IT SEEMS

01:29:18.352 --> 01:29:20.021
LIKE IMPROVEMENTS FOR SOME OF

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:21.522
THE SPORTS FACILITIES. THAT WERE

01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:23.958
JUST HIGHLIGHTED AND SEEM TO BE

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:29.797
SUCH. A OF ALL LWER- JUST OF

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:31.666
OUR LAST IMPROVED SPORTS

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:33.267
FACILITIES AND WE HAVE FOR OTHER

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:35.236
SIMILAR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:37.271
SO QUESTIONS WHAT RESOURCES ARE

01:29:37.338 --> 01:29:39.407
AVAILABLE TO THE STATE. A

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:40.374
SPECIAL SCHOOLS FOR

EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND I

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:44.779
THINK THAT SHOULD GO TO THE

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:46.547
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. SO

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.616
THERE IS NO LINE ITEM AT THIS

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:51.252
POINT BUT I DO WANT TO STATE

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:52.854
THAT LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHER

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.088
CALIFORNIANS THE GOVERNOR WAS
