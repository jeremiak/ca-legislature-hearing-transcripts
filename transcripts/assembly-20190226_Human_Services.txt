ONE MISTER GIBSON WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL ONE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH SEEKS TO MODERNIZE. THE FOSTER YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS BY ADDING THE RIGHTS THAT ARE INCLUSIVE OF THE YOUTH EXPERIENCE EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO EMPOWERING THEIR DECISION MAKING. FOSTER YOUTH HAVE TO OVERCOME. MANY BARRIERS AND MANY BURDENS AND HAVING HIGHER A HIGH RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND INCARCERATION -- THESE YOU HAVE FEW PEOPLE TO TURN TO THAT CAN HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE RESOURCES AND THE RIGHTS ENTITLED TO THEM UNDER THE FOSTER. CARE SYSTEM HERE IN THE STATE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I AUTHORED ASSEMBLY BILL TEN SIXTY SEVEN WHICH WAS SIGNED. BY THE GOVERNOR AT THAT REQUIRES TO CONVENE A WORK GROUP TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND UPDATE PROVISIONS IN THE FOSTER YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS. UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL. SERVICES DID NOT PROVIDE A REPORT LAST YEAR AND HAVE RECEIVED AN EXTENSION TO DO SO HOWEVER WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE REFLECTS -- THE NEED OF OUR FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY BILL ONE SEVENTY FIVE WILL ADD RIGHTS RELATED TO CULTURAL COMPETENT CARE ACCESS TO COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY. PRIVACY AND RESPECT TOWARDS LGBT STATUS AND GENDER IDENTITY. WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY ON ASSEMBLY BILL ONE SEVENTY FIVE WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING WHO SELF INTRODUCED HIMSELF THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION. HI THERE MY NAME'S. VANESSA HERNANDEZ I'M THE DOCTOR POLICY FOR CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION I'LL DEFER MY TIME TO MY COLLEAGUE -- MY NAME'S JOHN. SORRY MY NAME'S KIANA ARMED BURKE I AM A MEMBER OF THE CINEMA CHAPTER FOR CALIFORNIA USE CONNECTION [inaudible] ON ASSUME MOST OF YOU KNOW ABOUT CALIFORNIANS CONNECTION BUT IN CASE YOU DON'T. IS A YOUTH LED ORGANIZATION OF CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WHO DEVELOP LEADERS WHO EMPOWER EACH OTHER AND THE COMMUNITIES TO TRANSFORM THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THROUGH POLICY. PRACTICE AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGE. THE FOSTER YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS IS IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE RIGHTS AND WE NEED OUR RIGHTS -- FOSTER PARENTS HAVE THEIR BILL OF RIGHTS THESE ARE THE BILL OF RIGHTS WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WHICH IS EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO I'M TWENTY YEARS OLD. AND TO ME -- I'VE BEEN THINKING THE CAR WAS LIKE MAN I EIGHTEEN YEARS THAT WAS. AND SORRY. IT IS JUST IS A LONG TIME THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT WITHIN SOCIETY A LOT OF TRANSITION AND OUR USE. STILL NEED MORE. SUPPORT AND NEED TO KNOW THEIR RIGHTS -- IN MY EXPERIENCE I HAVE FULLY I'VE SEEN THE FOSTER CARE BILL OF RIGHTS WITH MY SOCIAL WORKER ONCE. AND THEN I JUST LOOKED AT IT MY FREE TIME. ANOTHER TIME. AND WHEN SHE SHOWED ME MY BILL OF RIGHTS IT WAS JUST A SIMPLE GLANCE THROUGH LOOK YOU HAVE THESE BILL RIGHT SO IT'S LIKE OKAY AND THEN WHEN I FINALLY SAT DOWN BY MYSELF TO READ IT. THEIR RIGHTS THE I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I HAD AND NOW THAT I'M NOT IN THIS THE SYSTEM. IT WAS KIND OF DISAPPOINTING FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAD THE RIGHT TO READ MY CASE FILE AND TO BE INFORMED. ABOUT MY SITUATION AND THE AGE OF TWELVE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOWN AND WOULD LIKE TO BEEN INFORMED ON WHEN I WASN'T CARE -- ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE MY BROTHER STILL CURRENTLY IN CARE AND I DON'T BELIEVE HE'S EVEN SEEN THE FOSTER CARE BILL OF RIGHTS. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MATTERS BECAUSE HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HOLD SOCIAL WORKERS AND AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE -- IF THE YOUTH THEMSELVES DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THESE RIGHTS EXIST. ON THEN UPDATING MATERIAL IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL INCLUDE YOUTH LIKE THE LGBTQ AND IT WILL IT EMPHASIZE THE ON GAPS THAT ARE MISSING CURRENTLY WITH THE OUT DATED INFORMATION IN THE FOSTER. CARE BILL OF RIGHTS. ARM. FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR EIGHT OF THREE I VOTE SORRY. ON AB ONE SEVEN FIVE BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. YOUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. HI I'M HERE AND JUST WOULD LIKE TO ASK A LOT OF WHAT KIANA SAID I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. IF NEEDED. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BACK A KRAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MERRY THERE WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. CALIPARI ALSO IN HUMBLE COUNTY TRANSITION YOU CHOOSE COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE THANK YOU A CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS GREG BIRCH AND I WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY THE BILL GIVES FOSTER CHILDREN THE RIGHT TO DEMAND THAT THEIR FOSTER FAMILIES VIOLATES. THEIR SINCERELY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ABOUT GENDER. AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW CHRISTIANS BELIEVE THAT GENDER OR SEX IS ENTIRELY BASED ON BIOLOGY. ESTABLISHED AT THE MOMENT OF CONCEPTION. THIS IS SOMETHING SPECIAL GIVEN TO US BY OUR CREATOR. FORCING FOSTER PARENTS TO REFER TO THEIR FOSTER CHILDREN AS THE WRONG GENDER IS FORCING THEM TO AFFIRM WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS A LIE. AND NOT ONLY A LIE BUT HARMFUL TO CHILDREN. AND THE MEDICAL SCIENCE BACKS IT UP. LOOK AT THE TESTIMONY I GAVE YOU FROM DOCTOR ANDRIY VON BOWL A REPRESENTED OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PEDIATRICIANS ANY NINE TIME FOSTER PARENT HIMSELF. HE COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY SO HE ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU HIS TESTIMONY. LOOK AT THE FIRST POINT. TRANS AGENDA VACATION OR GENDER DYSPHORIA AS HAS AN OVERWHELMING PROBABILITY OF RESOLVING ITSELF ON ITS OWN IF YOU DON'T ENCOURAGE KIDS TO EMBRACE THEIR GENDER CONFUSION AS THEIR NEW IDENTITY. LOOK APPOINT. TO UNDERLYING PSYCHOLOGICAL IN NEUROLOGICAL ISSUES NEED A DRESSING FIRST. AND THERE ARE MANY IN FOSTER CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THEM. AND THEY LOOK AT POINT SEVEN ON THE SECOND DURING HAVE DEVELOPING BRAINS IN OFTEN CHANGE THEIR MINDS. DON'T. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF TAKING PUBERTY BLOCKING DRUGS AND TOP SURGERY. THIS IS NOT SETTLED SCIENCE AS THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL WOULD LIKE YOU TO BELIEVE. I WAITED JUST GOOGLE FOR WORDS SOCIAL CONTAGION GENDER GENDER DYSPHORIA. CHILDREN ARE FALSELY ASSUMING THEY ARE TRANSGENDER BECAUSE OF PEER INFLUENCE AND THERE'S PLENTY OF BOTH ARTICLES BOTH CONSERVATIVE AND LIBERAL SAYING THE SAME THING. MANY FOSTER PARENTS OR PARENT ARE PEOPLE OF FAITH. THEY SEEK TO OBEY GOD AND TO FOLLOW GOD BY LOVING AND SERVING OTHERS PARENTS OUR HEROES THESE PARENTS ARE HEROES THAT YOU SHOULD BE RESPECTING AND NOT DRIVING AWAY. THIS LAW PUSHES THEM INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION THEY DON'T WANT TO MAKE. OBEY THE STATE OR OBEY GOD. THIS IS THE CHRISTIAN TEACHING IS VERY CLEAR ON THIS POINT. IF THEY HAVE -- THEY HAVE TO OBEY GOD IF THEY'RE FORCED TO DECIDE. PLEASE PLEASE SLOW DOWN. READ TALK TO CHRISTIAN FOSTER PARENTS THINK OF ALL THE GREAT SELF WITH FILL PHYLLIS THEROUX ICQ FOSTER PARENTS YOU'RE GONNA LOSE IF YOU APPROVE THIS BILL. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO CHASE THEM AWAY BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO DO PLEASE VOTE NO ON AB ONE SEVEN FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KEVIN SNYDER -- I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE CENTER. FOR PUBLIC POLICY WHERE I SERVICE CHIEF COUNSEL -- UP THE PROPOSED BILL ADDS AN ALL TO AN ALREADY LONG LIST OF MANDATED RIGHTS FOR USE YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE. AMONG THOSE HOUSE PRIVILEGES THE BILL ALLOWS TEENS THE UNFETTERED DISCRETION TO ATTEND RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL SERVICES IN ACTIVITIES OF THEIR CHOICE. SO IF A YOUNG PERSON EXERCISE PRIVILEGE UNDER THE BILL TO USE THE INTERNET BECOMES RADICALIZED BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND FOSTER PARENT I'M NOT GOING TO THE CHURCH YOUTH GROUP ANYMORE I'M NOW IN ODINIST SO DROP ME OFF AT THE NORDIC. TEMPLE SO I CAN BE WITH PEOPLE OF LIKE FAITH IN LIKE RACE. UNDER THIS BILL THE BILL REQUIRES THE FOSTER PARENT TO LISTEN AND OBEY THEIR TEENAGER. THE BILL THEN TAKES ANOTHER DANGEROUS TURN BY WEAPONIZE IN AN ADOLESCENT WITH THE FORCE OF LAW. TO COMPEL UNWILLING THIRD PARTY ADULTS TOOK TO REFER TO THE TEENAGER BY WHATEVER NAME AND PRONOUN [inaudible] THE TEENAGER. DESIRES FOR EXAMPLE A TEENAGE BOY COULD DIRECT A FOSTER PARENT TO USE THE PRONOUN THEY INSTEAD OF HE THIS IS A CONTENT BASED RESTRICTION ON SPEECH. IT IS IT IS ALSO COMPELLED SPEECH JUST THIS LAST YEAR THE US SUPREME COURT MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT QUOTES COMPEL INDIVIDUALS. TO MOUNT SUPPORT FOR VIEWS THEY FIND OBJECTIONABLE THAT WAS THE JANICE DECISION. AND THEN REFERRING TO SACRAMENTO LOFT MAKERS JUSTICE KENNEDY IN THE LAST OPINION THAT HE WROTE. SAID QUOTE GOVERNMENTS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO FORCE PERSONS TO EXPRESS A MESSAGE CONTRARY TO THEIR DEEPEST CONVICTIONS. IF YOU'RE RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS SCIENCE OR THE LOGIC OF GRAMMAR LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THAT A MALE IS THE HEAT. AND ONE PERSON IS NOT A DAY. THEN THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT FORCE AN INDIVIDUAL TO SAY SOMETHING KNOWN TO BE DEMONSTRABLY FALSE. IT IS S. ORWELLIAN IS FORCING SOMEONE TO SAY TWO PLUS TWO EQUALS. FIVE YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT NEED A BIG BROTHER TO WRITE A LONG LIST OF HOUSE PRIVILEGES THEY NEED PARENTS. WHO COULDN'T PARENT THEM THROUGH THE TURBULENCE OF BEING A TEENAGER? MADAM CHAIRMAN WOMAN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR IN FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY AND I VOTE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE NAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE IT WHAT OTHER WITNESSES THAT IN IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] MEMBERS. MEMBERS HAPPY CENTER LIKE WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ALONE ARE. WE'RE NOT IN OPPOSITION. SORRY FOR THE WRONG GROUP TO GET UP WITH A CAT IS AN EARLY MADONNA WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION I MISSED MY WINDOW WITH THIS OTHER SUPPORTERS I WANTED TO COME UP AND LET YOU KNOW WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATION THANK YOU. MARIA JOSE FERNANDEZ FLORES WITH THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE AND WE ARE IN OPPOSITION OF AB. ONE SEVENTY FIVE ARE THERE ARE THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MARK CHILSON AMERICAN FAMILY RIGHTS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. I TO APOLOGIZE I'M COMING AT THE WRONG TIME JOIN A KARMIC CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER CALIFORNIA CLEARLY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE DO HAVE A MOTION BUT WE DON'T HAVE A SECOND [inaudible] QUESTION. CAN WE GET A SECOND FIRST THANK YOU. YES. MISS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU TIME THANK YOU SOME NUMBER GIPSON. RAN THIS BILL FORD I DO HAVE A QUESTION -- I THINK THERE WAS. MAYBE ONE VALID ARGUMENT THAT RACE BY OR AT LEAST QUESTION RAISED BY THE OPPONENTS -- IF IT CHILD IN THIS BILL -- UNDER THIS BILL -- DID WANT TO JOIN A HATE GROUP -- OR COULD BE A DANGER TO THEM OR OTHER PEOPLE WITH THIS BILL PROHIBIT PARENTS FROM -- ALLOWING THEM TO DO THAT OR FACILITATING THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE SO. SO IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY WANTED TO JOIN A HATE GROUP. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO UNDER THE LAW THEY THEY WOULDN'T AND YOUR BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE PARENTS TO FACILITATE THAT THAT IS CORRECT. OKAY WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO CLARIFY THAT PERHAPS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD ABSOLUTELY OKAY AND THEN ON THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS ABOUT THE INTERNET ACCESS WHICH OF COURSE IS SOMETHING IN TODAY'S WORLD THAT. YOU COULD ARGUE IS VERY IMPORTANT -- BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN RESTRICTING OR EVEN STOPPING ACCESS TO THE INTERNET -- FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS COULD BE APPROPRIATE A CHILD WHO IS. USING THE INTERNET TOO MUCH NOT CONCENTRATING ON THEIR STAY VIEWING INAPPROPRIATE MATERIAL -- WITH THIS PROHIBIT PARENTS FROM RESTRICTING THAT ACCESS BASED ON ANY OF THOSE -- REASONS IT'S A REASONABLE -- IS REASONABLE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET RIGHT NOW IS IS THERE IS THERE GOING TO BE TO FIND SOMEWHERE IN THE BILL OR WHO WOULD MAKE THAT DECISION. WHAT THE PARENTS? THE PARENT MAKE ABSOLUTELY AND ALSO THERE'S MECHANISMS TO CERTAINLY MAKE SURE THAT A CHILD IT ARE IN BACK NOT NAVIGATING TO SITES THEY SHOULD NOT BE -- VIEWING AND PARTICIPATING IN SO JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LOT OF MEDALS IN THERE IF -- IF A FOSTER YOU THOUGHT THAT THERE ACCESS WAS BEING RESTRICTED UNREASONABLY. WHO WOULD THEY BRING THAT TO THAN TO THEIR CASE WORKER TO MAKE THE TERM FINAL DETERMINATION OF WHAT'S UP THERE'S ODDS THERE'S THE ODDS BUT CEMENT OKAY THAT? THEY CAN MAKE THEIR CONCERNS MADE KNOWN UNTO THOSE INTO TO THAT INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENT AND THEN THEY WILL ACT AS A CONDUIT TO WANT TO THE INVESTIGATION ALSO TRIED TO RE WRITE RESOLUTION PERFECT. THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU AND AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT. MAKING POLICY BASED ON TESTIMONY THAT'S FEAR MONGERING THAT'S INACCURATE AND THAT IS IS REALLY MEANT TO DRIVE AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE. THE LOT OF THE LOGIC JUST. SEEMS TO TO FAIL SO I I THINK. MR GIPSON YOUR YOUR POLICIES IS ABSOLUTE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE. THAT FOSTER KIDS BE RESPECTED WITH WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND AND NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP OF THE IGNORANCE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT A LOT OF TRANS GENDER ANOTHER YOUTH ARE. THE DIFFICULTIES THAT THERE GOING THROUGH. THIS NOTION THAT THERE WAS **** NILLY THING AND CAN BE TALKED OUT OF SOMETHING. IS JUST THERE'S NO SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR IT AND HAS CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF OF STRIFE AND AND PROBLEMS HISTORICALLY NOT JUST AND FOSTER YOUTH BUT IN TRANSGENDER YOUTH. THIS IS HAPPENED IN. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND AND OTHER SO I I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH THIS BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. FROM. I MEAN I I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS I THINK -- THE POINTS THAT I FOR CALLING MISS FRIEDMAN BROUGHT UP AS FAR IS -- DEFINING SOME OF THESE POINTS ON GOING FORWARD WOULD DEFINITELY BE BENEFICIAL. FOR WERE MAY BE PLAN OFF SOME POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS FROM SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE FUTURE -- YOU KNOW I I DO HAVE A CONCERN AND I SEE BOTH SIDES OF THIS. AND I YOU KNOW I I THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN MY AREA AND ESPECIALLY MY DISTRICT IS THE LACK OF ACCESS TO FOSTER PARENTS. AND THE LACK OF HOMES LACK OF HOMES ESPECIALLY -- FOR FOR SPECIAL NEEDS THAT NEED TO GET INTO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF BAD SITUATIONS. AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE. ANYTHING THAT WOULD PROHIBIT -- YOU NO MORE PARENTS BEING ABLE TO GET IN -- A I DO WANNA MAKE SURE THERE IS SOME KIND OF A MECHANISM WHERE IF THERE IS A CHILD IN A FOSTER -- SITUATION AND AND THEY DO YOU -- DECIDE THEIR IDENTITIES DIFFERENT OR THERE IS A SITUATION WHERE THE FOSTER PARENT NO LONGER FEELS COMFORTABLE THERE IS AN OUT -- SO YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING IT'S INTO SOMETHING BAD -- FOR EITHER THE PARENT OR THE CHILD BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO LOOSE -- GOOD FOSTER PARENTS -- REGARDLESS WHAT THEIR RELIGIOUS VALUES ARE -- AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ON ENSURING THE CARE -- BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOSTER'S THERE'S THERE'S NOT ENOUGH -- ESPECIALLY -- FOR CHILDREN THE EYEPIECE AND SPECIAL NEEDS. SO I I JUST YOU KNOW MY QUESTION FOR YOU -- MISTER GIBSON I KNOW YOU WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY TO ENSURE THAT DEFINITIONS GET DON AND POLICIES OR SET STRAIGHT -- YOU KNOW IN YOUR OPINION DOES THIS BILL HELP GET MORE FOSTER PARENTS YESTER NOW. I THINK THIS BILL HAS A GREAT POTENTIAL OF ONE INCREASING -- OF PARENTS TO TAKING IN FOSTER CHILDREN. ALSO UNDERSTANDING. OF THE COMPLEXITIES AND THE TRAUMA THAT THESE FALSE SO YOU'VE GO THROUGH THIS BEING A FOSTER CHILD PERIOD -- PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS BILL HAS BEEN A COMMITTEE HAS BEEN PUT TOGETHER -- LET. WITH ADULTS AND BEING AT THE TABLE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION. FOSTER YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS HAVEN'T BEEN UPDATED SINCE ITS FIRST CONCEPTION SO THIS IS ALMOST TWENTY OF THIRTY YEARS AGO I WOULD THINK SENATOR LIEU FOUR ONE HER TENACIOUS NOUS BRINGING US BEFORE US THAT WE HAVE A FALSE THE BILL OF RIGHTS. WE IN ADDITION TO THAT -- THIS BILL GOES A LOT FURTHER AND I JUST WANT TO INVITE THE COMMITTED TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE THINGS. INCLUDES THE RIGHTS TO RECEIVING -- GROOMING AND HYGIENE PRODUCTS REGARDLESS OF GENDER IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT ALLOWING -- SPECIFIC HEALTHCARE -- SUBSTANCE ABUSE DID ORDER -- INFORMATION AND ALSO HEALTHCARE -- CALCINED BEING PROVIDED IT ALSO DEALS WITH -- THE RIGHTS TO VISIT AND CONTEXT SIBLINGS WE HAVE A NUMBER I JUST SPOKE TO A YOUNG MAN JUST -- LAST WEEK WHO HAS NINE BROTHERS AND SISTERS ALL IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM BECAUSE MOTHER AND MOM AND DAD IS IN THE PENAL SYSTEM -- RECONNECTED FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME WAS BLOCKS AWAY FROM HIS BIOLOGIAL -- BROTHER WHO WAS A TWIN AND SET UP A DATE TO MEET THEM -- AND WAS KILLED NINE DAYS BEFORE THAT MEETING TOOK PLACE. SO HE LEFT WITH NOT EVEN HAVING OPPORTUNITY STEVEN KNOLL. LIKES AND DISLIKES OF HIS BROTHER TO SEE IF WE EVEN HAVE THE SAME KIND OF WALK OR OR SPEECH JUST LIKE THEM ITS SIMILARITIES AND SO THIS BILL PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY. BUT THOUGHT INVITE THE COMMITTEE -- TO LOOK THINGS IN IT AS WELL AS YOU KNOW YOU WERE OF FOCUS WHO HAD INPUT ON THESE A FOSTER USE THAT INPUT IN IN TERMS OF CREATING THIS FALSE YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS. AND CERTAINLY WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD -- AND TAKE SUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS MOVING FORWARD. YEAH MYSTERIES THAT IT'S I I KNOW A LOT OF THE MEASURES WEIGHT WITHIN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM ARE THERE TO PROTECT -- OUR USE THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEM. BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HAVE A BROTHER SISTER WHO'S BEEN GIVEN A HOLLER MY HAVE A RECORD OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES IN. A JUST WANNA ENSURE THAT AS YOUR BILL MOVE FORWARD -- WE'RE INSURING THAT PROTECTIONS ARE STILL THERE FOR THEM AND THAT WERE STILL MAKING SURE THAT THE FOSTER PARENTS AND THAT THE SYSTEM CAN ENSURE THAT. YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE A BROTHER SISTER OR A FAMILY MEMBER. THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE LOOKING AT OKAY WHAT IS THAT RELATIONSHIP ARE WE GETTING THEM. INTO POSSIBLE MORE TROUBLE BY THE CONTACT OR IS IT GONNA BE SAFE IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM YOU KNOW BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THAT THE JOB HERE IS NOT TO DO MORE HARM. ON IN TO BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT EMOTIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE MILITANT OTHER SOMEBODY OUT THERE THAT ACTUALLY LOVES THEM. AND WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM ON IT MOVING FORWARD I WILL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY -- BUT I DO ENCOURAGE YOU TO TIGHTEN UP THE LOOSE ENDS ON IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AMONG -- GOOD AND BAD. ASPECTS -- BY. ADDING EDITION ORDER Là. RIGHTS -- TO THE FOSTER. FOSTER CHILDREN -- THIS SOME MORE -- RESTRICTIONS SO. OF TO ME -- FOR THE FOSTER PARENTS TO FOLLOW. SO AS YOU HEARD THE I AM CONCERNED -- WHAT THE POTENTIAL FUTURE FOSTER PARENTS SO? WOULD BE AFRAID TO TO ACCOMMODATE THE OLDEST A NEW. ONE RIGHTS. AND THE MY OFFICE RECEIVED -- A SEVERAL PHONE CALLS TO FOR MY DISTRICT AND DOES NOT -- FROM -- WAR IN SUPPORT OF THAT THE AND I AM CONCERNED. FOR EXAMPLE -- ON ON OCT WITH THREE INDIVIDUAL -- ALL OF THE ITEMS SO FOR EXAMPLE -- ONE OF THEM. IS SOME MENTIONING OF AGE APPROPRIATE THE ALLOWANCES. IS THAT THE DANO DETERMINED WAS SO AGE APPROPRIATE THE ALLOWANCE OF IS SECONDLY IS THAT THE ARE. IF A DOLLAR TERMS WOULD BE DEFINED A IS THE GOVERNMENT PAID THE OR TO FOSTER. PARENT WOULD FORCED TO OUR OF LAW GIVEN BUDGET THE OROVILLE ONE POCKET THE SO THAT'S ALREADY. CODIFIED ALREADY IN TERMS OF WHAT STILL ALLOW ALLOW FOR IN TERMS OF ALLOWING THINGS WORKED OUT WITH THE FOSTER PARENT ITSELF. BUT ALSO YOU MADE MENTION IN TERMS OF THE FOSTER PARENTS. WERE LOOKING FOR LOVING HOMES INDIVIDUALS WHO LOVE THESE KIDS THESE CHILDREN -- FOR THEM OF LOVE FILLED WITH -- INVOLVEMENT IN INTO THEIR LIVES -- THIS BILL ONCE AGAIN -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS YOUTH FOCUS YOUTH AND ADULTS TOGETHER COLLABORATED TO PUT THESE AN UPDATE THE THE BOSS OF YOU THE BILL OF RIGHTS. THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE FACED -- TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES THEY WANT THE SAME THING LET ME SAY THAT THEY WANT THE SAME THING. YOU HAVE CHILDREN THAT YOU'VE GIVEN YOUR CHILDREN THEY WANT. A WARM BED TO SLATE TO START TO SLEEP IN INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW -- HAVING THERE'S ENTIRE LIFE DISRUPTED BY BEING MOVED FROM ONE PLACE TO THE NEXT. THEY WANT STABILITY -- AND THIS BILL PROVIDES ONLY STABILITY BUT IT INVITES PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE ACCESS -- WITH THE FOSTER YOU A TO COLLABORATE THAT'S THE FOSTER PARENTS AS SOCIAL WORKERS ABOUT THE CHILD ITSELF THAT'S THE COMMUNITY THAT'S THE SCHOOL THIS WILL PROVIDE ALL THOSE MECHANISMS -- THAT'S IN THIS IN THE BOSTON WE SEE THIS YOUTH KNOWING THEIR RIGHTS AND THE FOSTER PARENTS KNOW THEIR RIGHTS ALSO RESPECTING THOSE RIGHTS AS WELL. BECAUSE WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT -- ONE OF THIS IS YOU KNOW AS OF AMERICA AND THIS IS A STILL A PLACE WHERE EVEN AS A CHILD HAVE RIGHTS AS WELL. THIS IS SAW SO REALLY LOVELY. AND THE FOR THE LOVING FAMILY. AND THE DISORDER STRENGTH AND THAT THE I I HOPE. YOU'LL -- FOR WOULD BE ACHIEVED -- IF IT PASSES -- HOWEVER -- THE TO ME IS SO IF THIS ARE LOVING FAMILY -- FAMILY SHOULD THE BE GIVEN MORE. AUTHORITY HOW TO CRY. THEIR CHILDREN IN THE RIGHT AWAY. RATHER THAN -- FOR EXAMPLE. THE LINE'S TO SOMEWHERE I THOUGHT I READ YOU CAN EVEN CHOOSE YOUR NAME LAST NAME OR WHATEVER. IT IS THAT THE IN MY FAMILY -- TO WHY ALLOW MY CHILD THAT HEY YEAH. IN ALL I WANNA BE IN ALL. OUR OWN AGENDA MY LAST NAME IS SOMETHING ELSE SO WOULD I ALLOW THAT. NOT THE LOVING -- WHICHEVER NAME COMES WITH A WOULD NOT CHANGE THE LAST NAMES -- TO SO I DON'T KNOW AS A PARENT -- UNSTABLE FOR A MOTION FOR LAWFUL EMOTIONAL TRAUMA. TYPICALLY THEY MAY BRING IN. AND THE TEENAGE AREA AT THE ALL THE GOOD CRITERIA. FOR THEM TO BE GUIDED THE PROPERLY. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE. SO HERE THIS SEEMS TO BE YA EMPHASIZING. INDIVIDUAL. IN THE UNITED STATES INDIVIDUAL WATER RIGHTS. SO THAT TO ME IS A SEPARATING. BUT THE PET FAMILY UNIT RATHER THAN. ALLOWING HER EYES SO. TO DO THEIR BEST. TO ASSERT. FAMILY. HEY SINCE YOU ARE OUT FOSTER CHILD WE HAVE DESCRIBED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO. DUST IMPRESSION I'M GETTING. K. YOU WANT A RESPONSE TO THE NO THAT WAS A STATEMENT OKAY THICKNESS ANANUS WANTED TO ADDRESS THE POINT YES THANK YOU YOUR HONOR. I CAN -- ADDRESS BOTH THE NAME -- TOPIC THAT YOU'RE REYES AND A FEW OTHER ELEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ELEVATED HERE -- I GREW UP IN FOSTER CARE MYSELF WHERE I EMANCIPATED -- I WAS ABLE TO BE IN THE SAME FOSTER HOME BETWEEN THAT TIME FRAME BETWEEN SEVEN EIGHTEEN SORRY. ARE THEY THE NAME CONVERSATION DID COME UP THEY WANTED ME TO ALSO TAKE THEIR LAST NAME BUT FOR ME PERSONALLY IT FELT LIKE I WAS LOSING A PIECE OF MY IDENTITY. THAT I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH LEADER GOT IT TATTOOED BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO PERMANENT AND IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT I WANTED TO BE PART OF THIS UNIT. BUT THAT'S MY DECISION AND THAT'S WHAT I HAVE AS A PERSON AND THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO GROW UP IN OUR TAKEN FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR FAMILY IN PEOPLE THAT THEY KNOW. SCRAPS OF IDENTITY OR SOMETIMES THE ONLY THING WE HAVE SO FOR THAT EXAMPLE SPECIFICALLY. WITH THAT BEING SAID THAT DID NOT WATER DOWN MY FAMILY BONDS WHEN I SPEAK OF MY MOM AND MY SISTERS. THEY ARE MY MOM AND MY SISTERS RATE -- SO THERE'S THAT ELEMENT OF THAT AND IT YOU KNOW I THINK THE FIRST YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS IS BEAUTIFUL AND IMPACTFUL FOR LOTS OF REASONS. IT DOESN'T POWER THE YOUNG PERSON A DOES HE QUIPPED CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO KNOW WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THEY'RE IN SURVIVAL MODE. AND A LOT OF TIMES THE SYSTEM AND SOCIETY HAS GIVEN UP ON THEM TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN SO IF WE CAN EQUIP THEM WITH ONE POLICIES BILL OF RIGHTS ON HOW TO NAVIGATE. THE SYSTEM THAT'S THE LEAST THAT WE CAN DO WHEN CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE ENTERED THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ST WE CAN PARENT BETTER THAN YOUR CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCE. AND SO BY A IN GIVING THEM CERTAIN ENTITLEMENTS AND RIGHT IT'S IT'S VERY MINIMAL MINIMAL. THAT MEANS THAT NOT EVERYONE FINDS PERMANENCY IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM A LOT OF FOLKS EMANCIPATE WHEN THEY ARE EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY ONE AND STILL DON'T HAVE A FAMILY TO CALL THEIR OWN. GIVING THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO BE A SELF ADVOCATE TO NAVIGATE COLLEGE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS DOCUMENT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT UPDATES IT FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT. DON'T FIND THE STABILITY WITHIN THE TOLD IT'S IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT THEM AND SO WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. MR GIVES LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK THAT WE FOR REMEMBER THE TITLE OF IT IT'S THE FOSTER YOUTH. BILL OF RIGHTS. IT IS THEIR BILL OF RIGHTS IS IT'S AN EXTENSION OF WHAT WAS ALREADY PROVIDED TO THEM. AND AS HAS BEEN NOTED BY OUR COLLEAGUES. IT'S ALREADY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE GOING AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY DO HAVE RIGHTS -- WE WE STILL HAVE AS WE KNOW THE PRUDENT TO PARENT STANDARD. SO THE PARENTS ARE STILL THE PARENTS AND THEY'RE STILL GOING TO WORK WITH THE CHILD THAT THEIR LOVE THING. AS THEIR FOSTER CHILD AS THEIR CHILD I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU HAD TO ONE FOSTER FAMILY THROUGHOUT YOUR TIME BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT. THE WAY IT IS FOR MANY OF OUR FOSTER YOUTH. A SOME COMMENTS WERE MADE ABOUT THE RIGHT TO RE ATTEND RELIGIOUS SERVICES. THAT ALREADY EXISTS THE ONLY THING THAT WAS CHANGED AS I UNDERSTAND TO MISTER GIBSON IS TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND CULTURAL SERVICES AS WELL. SO THIS IS REALLY PART I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM OUR COLLEAGUES -- AND AND WOOD NAIL. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AS WELL AS ALL THE DIALOGUE THAT HAS TRANSPIRED I CERTAINLY REAPED BY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION HAS TAKEN PLACE -- I JUST WANT -- TO JUST SAYING SIMPLY THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE HUMAN. THEY HAVE FEELINGS THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED IN MANY MANY WAYS -- AND I AM A FIRM BELIEVER OF MARK TWELVE AND THIRTY ONE LOVE THY NEIGHBORS AS I SELF. AND THAT'S WERE SAYING RIGHT NOW THE CHILD THAT YOU SAY YOU WILL BRING INTO YOUR HOME LOVE THEM JUST LIKE THAT CHILD WAS YOUR OWN BIOLOGICAL CHILD. GIVE THEM THE SAME KIND OF LOVE AND RESPECT THAT YOU WOULD GIVE YOUR OWN BIOLOGICAL CHILD THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. YES WILL PROVIDE THE GUIDANCE AS PARENTS I'M TO THESE CHILDREN WILL STILL DO THAT BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT YOU LOVE THEM REGARDLESS -- OF THE HICK UPS OR WHATEVER THE THAT THEY GO THROUGH IN LIFE UNDER YOUR CARE -- JUDGE MY CHART MY CHILDREN AS MUCH AS I LOVE THEM THEY HAVE FALLEN DOWN AND MADE MISTAKES BUT GUESS WHAT. I DISCIPLINE THEM I LOVE THEM MY THE YOU KNOW THAT MY FATHER LOVES ME UNCONDITIONALLY AS WELL AND YOU CAN TAKE THAT. BOTH WAYS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHAT I VOTE.

I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR JOINING THE ASSEMBLY HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE TODAY FOR THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. TO LEARN ABOUT HOW PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER. IMPACTS THE PROVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE STATE'S FOSTER YOUTH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEN COOLEY WILL BE HERE SHORTLY HE STEPPED OUT. AND WHEN HE RETURNS I WILL ASK FOR HIS BRIEF COMMENTS AS CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON FOSTER CARE. CHILDREN AND YOUTH. WHO HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES AND ARE IN THE STATE'S CARE? AS A RESULT OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA. THAT CAN IMPACT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT NOT ONLY IN THE IMMEDIATE IMMEDIATE TERM BUT ALSO INTO ADULTHOOD. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THESE CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO ENSURE THAT THEY RECEIVE THE SERVICES. NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH. IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE ALONG WITH THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON FOSTER CARE EXAMINED WHAT. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU AND THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF TRANSFERRING RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FROM A FOSTER YOUTH ORIGINAL COUNTY. TO THE YOUTH COUNTY OF RESIDENCE. WE ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT HOW THE SHIFTING OF RESPONSIBILITY OR PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER IMPACTS THE PROVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FOSTER YOUTH WERE PLACED. OUT OF THE COUNTY. IN RECENT YEARS THE STATE HAS UNDERTAKEN A SERIES OF EFFORTS KNOWN AS KNOWN COLLECTIVELY. AS CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM WITHIN OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR FOSTER YOUTH. MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK STONE. HAS OFFERED A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT SERVE AS A FOUNDATION FOR THESE REFORMS. A KEY GOAL. OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM IS ENSURING THAT ALL FOSTER YOUTH ARE PROPERLY ASSESSED TRIDENTINE FARTHER MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND THEN PROVIDED WITH ADEQUATE SERVICES TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT THE WELL BEING OF YOUTH. WHO ARE PLACED IN CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM? IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT I HOPE WE ALL APPROACH TODAY'S HEARING. I HOPE THAT WE CAN LEAVE AT THE END OF THIS HEARING NOT ONLY WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER AS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE ARISEN IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION. IT ALSO WITH THE SENSOR PROMISING DIRECTIONS AND SOLUTIONS. I HOPE WE LEAVE TODAY. READY TO TAKE THE NEXT STEPS TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF SERVING ALL FOSTER YOUTH IN WAYS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH STABLE LOVING HOMES. NECESSARY SERVICES AND BRIGHT FUTURES. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE PANELISTS TODAY FOR TAKING TIME TO SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE WITH US. IF ANY OF THE OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO GIVE SOME OPENING REMARKS.

SHOULD ALSO MENTION AT THE OUTSET THAT CLEARLY -- AS A COUNTY ADMINISTERED STAY THE DIE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN OFTEN ARE PLACED OUTSIDE OF THEIR COUNTY -- FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS AND OVER THE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT HAVE TAKEN A LOOK AT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF IT TO TRY TO SOLVE -- DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN OVER TIME -- AND SO PART OF WHAT I'LL DESCRIBE TO YOU -- AT IN A FEW MINUTES IS IS WHAT HOW WHAT'S AT HOW WHAT THOSE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE AND AND WHY THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE -- OFF AND PLACED IT WHERE THEY ARE PLACED WHITE WHERE THEY LIVE WHY THEY LIVE WHERE THEY THEY THE TWO LEFT. BUT FIRST LET ME JUST START WITH SAYING THAT THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT -- STARTS AT THE HOTLINE -- A HOTLINE CALL AND AT ANY GIVEN TIME THERE'S AROUND -- AT ANY GIVEN YEAR THERE'S AROUND FOR LAST YEAR THERE WAS NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PLUS TO THE HOT LINE OF THOSE. A COUNTIES OFTEN HAVE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE IT -- A IS SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO WARRANT SOME KIND OF AN OF AN INVESTIGATION WITH THE NEED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY THEY LEAD THEY THEY INVESTIGATE WITHIN. TEN DAYS OR OTHER IT'S AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION WHEN THEY DO INVESTIGATE -- THE THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AROUND SEVENTY THOUSAND OF THOSE YOUNG SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND OF THE THOSE OF THOSE. OF THOSE SITUATIONS RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIATION OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT. SHOULD NOTE ALSO THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT COME INTO OUR OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM OR INTO FOSTER CARE. MORE SIR BY THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM ARE ARE COME IN AS A RESULT OF OF NEGLECT OVER 70% TO COME IN AND AS A RESULT OF OF OF NEGLECT. OF THE SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWELVE SUBSTANTIATION LAST YEAR -- TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND ENDED UP IN NEW ENTRIES INTO FOSTER CARE. AND AT ANY GIVEN TIME -- IN THE YEAR WE HAVE AROUND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE IN FOSTER CARE -- CASE MANAGE BOTH BY COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENTS AND SOME BY THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S. ON THAT'S DOWN FROM A HIGH OF OVER A HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND OVER A DECADE AGO. SO WHEN CHILDREN ARE IN PLACE MEANT WHEN THEY'RE BUT WHEN -- THEY LIVE IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE LIVE IN FAMILIES -- OR FOR OUR OR NON REAP WHAT WE CALL NOT RELENT NOT RELATED EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS THOSE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE. UNKNOWN TO THE YOUNG PERSON WHO THEY HAVE HAVE A CONNECTION WITH. HOMES 23% LIVE IN -- FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES THAT ARE A PRIVATE NONPROFIT PRIVATE -- YOU FOSTER FAMILY -- AND 7% LIVE IN CONGREGATE CARE -- AND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT I THINK IT IS AS THE DAY GOES ON SHOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF OTHER PLACEMENT TYPES -- SO THOSE NUMBERS I GAVE YOU DON'T ADD UP TO A HUNDRED THAT OUR 2100% BUT A NUMBER OF THE UP THERE ARE OTHERS OTHER PLACEMENT TYPES WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE LIVE COURT SPECIFIED HOMES PRE ADOPTIVE HOMES. TRIAL HOME VISITS A NUMBER OF A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS -- AND AS WELL AS AS IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS HEARING WE DO HAVE IN A NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO -- ARE LIVING I'M IN IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAMS OR IN ON THEIR OWN AS A RESULT OF EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. SO -- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THE MOST OF THAT AND THAT THE MINOR DEPENDENCE IN OUR SYSTEM LIVE IN FAMILIES OF DIFFERENT -- IN A DIFFERENT -- TYPES. SO THERE ARE THE THE QUESTION I THINK THAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT -- ULTIMATELY IS SO WENT WHAT HAPPENS WHITE WIRE YOUNG PEOPLE PLACED. IN SITUATIONS ARE IN IN HOMES THAT AREN'T -- IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH THEY THEIR FOR THEIR PARENTS HAVE PRESIDED AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THAT THE THE MOST OFTEN IT'S BECAUSE THERE WITH HER THERE WITH THE RELATIVE. TO THAT THE RELATIVE OF MAY IN MAY LIVE IN A DIFFERENT COUNTY BUT IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE THE CONNECTIONS WITH THAT YOUNG PERSON TO MINIMIZE THAT THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA -- A RELATIVE PLACEMENT IS OFTEN SOUGHT AND SO THERE'S A GOOD -- I'LL GIVE YOU SPECIFIC NUMBERS FOR THAT -- LATER -- ANOTHER REASON IS THAT SOMETIMES YOUNG PEOPLE -- BECAUSE OUR IN ORDER TO PLACE SIBLINGS TOGETHER TO KEEP KEEP THAT LEVEL OF FAMILY CONNECTION SOMETIMES THERE NEEDS TO BE A A PLACEMENT ACROSS THE COUNTY LINE EITHER. AGAIN WITH A RELATIVE OR SOMETIMES WITH A PRIVATE FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY THAT'S ABLE TO SUPPORT A LARGER GROUP OF OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO STAY TOGETHER -- IN CERTAIN SOME SITUATIONS DEPENDING ON THE THE NATURE OF THE OF THE COUNTY -- AND THERE MAY NOT BE AS AT THAT TIME AND SO IN ORDER -- TO HAVE AN EXPEDITIOUS -- PLACEMENT IN A FAMILY -- IT REQUIRES THAT A FAMILY -- BE -- ACROSS THERE ANOTHER JURISDICTION BE IDENTIFIED AND AND THE YOUNG PERSON'S PLACE THERE. AND THEN ALSO AS A PART IT SOMETIMES AS A PART OF THE YOUNG PERSON'S HEALING FROM THE COMPLEX TRAUMA THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED. THERE -- THEY NEED A STRUCTURED RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM AT LEAST FOR IN A SHORT IT FOR A SHORT TIME. AND THOSE OFTEN READ REQUIRE -- OUT OF COUNTY PLACEMENTS THOSE RESOURCES MARKET EVERY JURISDICTIONS -- THE PROGRAMS ARE SOMEWHAT SPECIFIC SPECIFIC NEEDS PERCENT -- THEY THEY ARE -- PLACED OUT OF COUNTY. SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD JUST GIVE YOU A WAY -- TO A POTENTIAL WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE NUMBERS AND HOW HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT. OUT BY CATEGORY AND AND KIND OF THE RATIO -- BY CATEGORY. ITHINK THE THE BACKGROUND -- KIND OF OUTLINED -- PARTLY WHAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON AND PLACEMENT TYPES HER OUT OF COUNTY -- PLACEMENTS I THINK OF ONE WAY THAT I OFTEN LOOK AT IT IS HOW MANY WITHIN THOSE CATEGORIES WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE IN COUNTY VERSUS OUT OF COUNTY. AND WHAT WHAT'S THE OVERALL NUMBER AND SO IF YOU -- BEAR WITH ME I'LL JUST GIVE YOU THOSE THAT SO WHEN YOU THINK OF OF PLACEMENTS -- ABOUT PERCENT OF OF KIDS IN RELATIVE PLACEMENTS ARE IN THE COUNTY OF ORIGIN. AND 20% OR IN A PLACE ACROSS COUNTY LINES. THAT RESULTS IN JUST UNDER FOUR THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE -- PLACED OUT OF COUNTY BUT WHO ARE LIT WHO ARE LIVING WITH RELATIVES WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THE THE COUNTY APPROVED HOMES OFTEN CALLED -- COUNTY FOSTER HOMES. 91% OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE PLACED WITHIN THE COUNTY AND 9% OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY. AND THAT'S AT THE END THAT RESULTS IN ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED JUST UNDER SEVEN HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE IN COUNTY APPROVED HOMES BEING PLACED OUT OF COUNTY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT -- THE OF THE FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES OF PLACEMENTS. 70% OF THOSE ARE IN COUNTY AND 30% OUT OF COUNTY AND THERE IS THAT THERE IS -- AROUND -- THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED WHEN YOU -- OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE SERVED IN AND FOSTER FAMILY. HOMES AT THAT ARE OUT OF COUNTY. AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE R. CONGREGATE CARE BOTH OUR SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS AND OUR GROUP HOMES -- THERE A 51% MAIN IN THEIR COUNTY AND 4409% ARE PLACED OUT OF COUNTY. AB AS OF JANUARY FIRST OUR DATA AS OF JANUARY FIRST SO THAT RESULTS IN AND AROUND TWENTY ONE HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE BEING PLACED OUT OUT OF COUNTY FOR THOSE VERY SPECIALIZED -- INTENSIVE SERVICES [inaudible] SO -- WHICH JUST KIND OF TICKET TO WRAP UP. WE EAT AT THIS THIS THIS IS THE DISCUSSION THAT WILL TAKE PLACE LATER TODAY AND OR OR LATER ON THIS PANEL AND AND IN THE END THE PANEL LATER. WE THE DEPARTMENT REMAINS YOU KNOW COMMITTED TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS -- TO AS TO IDENTIFY THE ISSUES AND TO AND TO WORK THROUGH SOLUTIONS -- TO THAT THAT HAVE -- THAT NEED TO NEED TO OCCUR TO MODIFY OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WITHOUT ALL -- POTS AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOLKS MIGHT HAVE. WHAT WOULD LEAVE THE QUESTIONS TO THE END OF THE PANEL? FOR DID YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION. VICE CHAIR MATH. ON JUST REAL QUICK -- I DIDN'T HEAR YOU MENTION A NUMBER ON HOW MANY LIKE SPECIAL NEEDS -- I EP KIDS AND I KNOW THAT'S ALSO A LARGE REASON WHY -- CHILDREN GET PLACED OUT OF THE COUNTIES SELL IT AS WE GO FORWARD AND LOVE TO HAVE THE NUMBERS ON THOSE AS WELL. THANK YOU MR ROSE SEVEN ALSO HERNANDEZ. HI AGAIN. I'M FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS AND STAFF FOR ELEVATING IN THIS TOPIC -- FOR TODAY'S HEARING SPECIFICALLY THAT THIS INTERSECTION IS ONE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT WE KNOW THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE QUALITY CULTURALLY RELEVANT AND ACCESSIBLE IS ONE THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS THAT THE SYSTEMS CAN EXECUTE -- SOME FOLKS ALSO KNOW THAT SEE WE SEE IS A YOUTH LED ORGANIZATION WE HAVE CHAPTERS FROM STARTING FROM HUMBLE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SAN DIEGO AND WE PUT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE DECISION MAKING SEE. OF WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE WE ARE IN YEAR TWO OF A FOSTER STABILITY CAMPAIGN AND THE VISION OF THIS CAMPAIGN IS TO CREATE A YOUTH CENTER PROCESS. THAT WILL NURTURE THE MIND BODY AND SOUL CARE THE GOAL OF THIS CAMPAIGN IS TO FOSTER STABILITY AND ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR LIVES. INCLUDING PLACEMENT RELATIONSHIPS AND LIFE CONNECTIONS HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH TODAY I THINK WE CAN ASK OURSELVES ABOUT THE LANGUAGE WERE USING AND HOW WE TALK ABOUT THIS POPULATION WE CAN CALL THESE PLACEMENT CHANGES OR WE CAN CALL THEM LIFE DISRUPTIONS. TODAY WILL FOCUS ON THE LAST PILLAR THAT MY MEMBERS HAVE ELEVATED AND HIGHLY OUR MEMBERS THOUGHT SENTIMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS BOTH BROADLY AND IN REGARDS TO PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER. WHEN MY MEMBERS WHO HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCE TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS STORIES THAT MISDIAGNOSES OVER MEDICATION ABSENT CARE GIVERS AND LONELINESS ARE THEMES THAT QUICKLY EMERGE? AND WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS THINGS SUCH AS SYSTEM CORONATION SOMEONE TO BE ON THEIR SIDE BETTER SERVICES THAT ARE NOT TYPICAL CLINICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS ART THERAPY EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES SOCIAL EMOTIONAL ANIMALS -- THOSE THEMES EMERGE TO JUST AS QUICKLY. THEY'VE EVEN COINED A NEW TERM CALLED THERAPISTS OF ORIGIN FOR CONTINUITY IN SERVICES. AND THE SENTIMENT ALWAYS ENDS UP BEING. WE WANT TO LEARN HOW TO HEAL DEVELOP HEALTHY COPING SKILLS AND LIVE THE REST OF OUR LIVES TO BE HAPPY AND HEALTHY. THIS IS WHAT MY MEMBERS ARE SAYING. YET WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM OF DELIVERY IS INCREDIBLY BUREAUCRATIC IT'S HARD TO NAVIGATE AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS AS YOU'D CENTERED AS IT SHOULD BE. I'D LIKE TO SHARE MY TIME WITH MY COLLEAGUES CALLA. HELLO CALIPERS HEY ALL SAN AND I AM AN ADVOCATE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE A MENTAL HEALTH AND THE YOUTH ORGANIZER AND FORMER YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER WITH THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY TRANSITION AGE YOUTH COLLABORATION OR EIGHT CTC. I WE ARE YOUTH LEADERSHIP AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION BASED IN HUMBLE COUNTY THAT UP LET'S THE VOICES OF YOUNG PEOPLE WITH EXPERIENCE AND FOSTER CARE JUVENILE JUSTICE. HOMELESSNESS AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. SO I SUPPORT A YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD AND ON MY YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD I HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF YOUNG FOSTER LEADERS. AT THE FOSTER LEADERS THAT I SUPPORT TELL ME OF THEIR EXTREME SOCIAL ANXIETY BEING FORCED TO TAKE PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS AS YOUNG AS AGE. TEN LONELINESS ISOLATION AND HOPELESS HOW THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND TRAUMA PREVENTED THEM FROM HAVING SUCCESSFUL PLACEMENTS AND LIFELONG CONNECTIONS PLACEMENTS AND PEOPLE THEY WISH WERE STILL IN THEIR LIVES BUT WEREN'T EQUIPPED TO SUPPORT THEM. MENTAL HEALTH HAS EVEN BECAUSE SOME YOUNG PARENTS TO HAVE THEIR OWN CHILDREN BE INVOLVED IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THESE CHALLENGES INCREASE WHEN THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES OF ORIGIN. THERE'S AN INCREASING NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR RURAL COUNTIES THAT ARE PLACED OUTSIDE DUE TO THE LACK OF ADEQUATE FOSTER HOMES. ISN'T ENOUGH. THE EXPERIENCE CHANGES IN PROVIDERS. THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR NATURAL SUPPORTS AND THAT CONSTANT DISRUPTIONS EXTREMELY TRAUMATIZING BUILDING UPON THE TRAUMA THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE EXPERIENCE AND CAUSE THEM TO ENTER THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME A GOING MONTHS WITHOUT MEDICAL SERVICES AFTER PLACEMENT CHANGE AND A LACK OF ADEQUATE PLANNING TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THEIR WELLNESS NEEDS MATT. ADDITIONALLY MY YOUNG LEADER STATE THAT A LACK OF CONNECTION ISN'T SOMETHING THAT IS ABLE TO BE MET WITH THERAPY. THERE ARE VERY FEW THERAPEUTIC FOSTER HOMES AND ASK YOUR TWO PEAS IN RURAL COUNTIES THERE ARE NONE IN MY COMMUNITY AND WE DO NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY SUPPORT FOSTER YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND AS A RESULT THEY ARE FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR COMMUNITIES OF ORIGIN. WE NEED STRONGER COORDINATION OF CARE AND FUNDING FOR RESOURCE POOR AREAS OF CALIFORNIA SUCH AS MINE TO ENSURE THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO BE REMOVED FROM OUR COMMUNITY IS. IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO POINT TO THE KATIE A SETTLEMENT THAT IS EXPLAINED ON PAGE THREE OF YOUR BACKGROUND SHE I'M PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH THE SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR CALIFORNIA FOR SEVERAL YEARS -- AND THE PRIOR PRIORITIES INCLUDE REALLY SUPPORTING SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND COORDINATED SERVICES SO WHEN I SAW THIS I SCANNED RATHER QUICKLY BEING SEMI FAMILIAR WITH IT -- WHEN I DID SOMETHING JUMPED OUT AT ME IN A WAY I HADN'T BEFORE KATIE WHO'S THE SADDAM IS NAMED AFTER HIM GREW UP IN FOSTER CARE AND HAD THIRTY SEVEN PLACEMENT CHANGES? THIS NUMBER STOOD OUT NOW BECAUSE OF RIDLEY ALARMING BUT HEALTH FAMILIAR WAS -- BOTH CALLIN NICER BUT IN ORGANIZATIONS WHERE THAT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO THIS VERY DAY WILL CAN BOTH. GIVE YOU A LIST OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL EXPERIENCING THIS. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE WITH IS THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE? OUR BRAVE FOR THEIR COURAGEOUS THEIR PROBLEM SOLVERS AND THEY DESERVE ALL THE SUPPORT IN COURT NEEDED SERVICES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THEM AND SO MUCH MORE. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU -- BRENDON CREOLIZATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS APRENDER GRAY LUNCH ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. I'M SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TODAY AND TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH CERTAIN SERVICES SYSTEM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR SISTER AGENCY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ARE WORKING ON THE SHARED POPULATION -- OF YOUTH WHO WERE IN FOSTER CARE. I'M ALL CAN KINDA GO ABROAD ON ON A A LARGE LEVEL ON WHAT BY WHO WE ARE WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION -- WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION -- SO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS THE SINGLE STATE AGENCY FOR THE FEDERAL MEDICAID PROGRAM SO WE OPERATE THAT AS MEDI CAL IN CALIFORNIA. AND WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- MY AREA OF THE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTRACTING WITH THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS UNDER AYE WHAT'S CALLED THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE SPECIAL SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WAIVER -- WHICH IS WHERE WE I INDIVIDUALS WITH ON SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND STUFF FOR CHILDREN SERIOUSLY EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED CHILDREN -- AND WE HAVE I THINK FIFTY SIX MENTAL HEALTH PLANS SOME THAT WE CONTRACT WITH AND AND UNDER THAT CONTRACT COUNTY IS ESSENTIAL WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROVISION OF OUR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR ARRANGING FOR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES SO OFTEN TIMES -- EITHER -- IT COULD EITHER PROVIDE THE SERVICES THEMSELVES OR CONTRACT OUT FOR THOSE FROM -- SERVICES OR SOME COUNTIES MIGHT HAVE A HYBRID OF BOTH -- FOR CHILDREN UNDER AGE TWENTY ONE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED UNDER WHAT'S CALLED EPS D. T. R. EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT -- WHICH IS AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM IT MEANS THESE CHILDREN -- WHO MEET SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA ARE ENTITLED TO THESE SERVICES -- THEIR CRITERIA FOR CHILDREN -- IS A LITTLE BIT LESS STRINGENT THAN IT IS FOR ADULTS SEEKS TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE OR PREVENT -- FURTHER -- ISSUES FOR THE CHILD AND YOUTH SO -- SO THERE ARE A LOT OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE WHO ARE IN ON THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SYSTEM WHEN WE HAVE A DATA MANAGER DATA SHARING AGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR DEPARTMENT SO WE'RE ABLE -- TO MONITORED THAT THAT -- THAT IS THE SHARED POPULATION -- WE DO AN ANNUAL -- PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD -- WHERE WE MATCH THE DATA WITH OUR SOCIAL SERVICES DATA FOR THESE CHILDREN AND YOUTH -- AND JUST TO GIVE YOU KIND OF AN IDEA -- WE HAVE ABOUT 43% OF THE YOUTH IN A PARTICULAR IN ANY GIVEN FISCAL YEAR -- WHO ACTUALLY -- PENETRATE INTO OUR SYSTEM SO HIT OUR SYSTEM WHICH IS TYPICALLY AN ASSESSMENT AND THEN ABOUT -- ON THAT FIGURE ON AND THAT IS -- IT'S OUT OF THE WHOLE MEDI CAL POPULATION SO IT DOESN'T COST SLICE IT MIGHT NEED -- THAT IS SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING ON WITH OUR OUR SISTER AGENCY AND WITH THE C. C. R. WITH CONTINUE OUR CARE REFORM IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF KAONS ON THE CHILD ADOLESCENT NEEDS AND STRENGTHS -- TO ALL WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO KIND OF PLAYER ON THE SEA WHICH KIDS NEED THOSE SERVICES -- AND THEN AND THEN SEE WHAT THE REFERRALS THE SCREENS IN THE REFERRALS AND KNOW WHICH ONES ACTUALLY GET IT -- AND JUST FOR COMPARISON -- FOR THE ENTIRE MEDI CAL CHILDREN AND YOUTH POPULATION IT'S ABOUT -- PENETRATE INTO THE SYSTEM AND ABOUT 3% CONTINUE ON FOR SERVICES. SO DEFINITELY A LOT OF MONEY A MUCH HIGHER PROPORTION OF FOSTER CARE SIR -- CHILDREN RECEIVE SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAN THE GENERAL MEDI CAL POPULATION -- IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH CARVED OUT SYSTEM WITH THAT'S WERE OPERATED WHERE COUNTIES -- IF THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AS OF JULY JANUARY ONE TWENTY FOUR TEAM -- THE STATE OUR DOCTOR THE ESSENTIAL -- HEALTH BENEFITS KLAY EXPANDED -- BENEFITS IN THE MANAGED CARE AREA -- FOR SO PRIMARY CARE TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OFTENTIMES IT'S REFERRED TO AS MILD TO MODERATE BUT CHILDREN WITH MILD TO MODERATE CAN ALSO RECEIVE SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- WE ALSO DO TRACK THOSE DATA TO THIS TO SEE WHICH SYSTEM THAT THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH OR MOST OFTEN RECEIVING THEIR SERVICES -- AND SO -- SO WE HAVE THESE TWO SYSTEMS WE HAVE MANAGED CARE AND AND IN TERMS OF UTILIZATION TO OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH WHO WERE IN FOSTER CARE ABOUT HALF OF THEM ARE IN MANAGED CARE AND ABOUT HALF OF THEM ARE IN FEE FOR SERVICE. THERE'S NO MANDATE THAT CHILDREN NEED TO GO INTO MANAGED CARE IT'S AN OPTION -- BUT WE'RE SEEING IT CHANGE AND SHIFT OVER TIME ABOUT 80% OF THE GENERAL MEDICAL POPULATION IS IN MANAGED CARE -- IN TERMS OF KT EIGHTY OF A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE BETWEEN OUR DEPARTMENTS -- AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE -- ARE IN TERMS OF BUILDING OUT THE THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO UNDER THE COR PRACTICE MODEL WE HAVE -- INTENSIVE CARE COORDINATION AND INTENSIVE HOME BASED SERVICES I SEE SEE AN H. B. US -- THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE IS IS GOING TO BE WRIST IS TO BE BUILDING OUT -- TO PROVIDE CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH THE SUPPORT THE AND HAPPY AND HEALTHY -- AND WE'VE BEEN CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT AS RUSSIAN HOUSE ROLLED INTO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM -- AND IN TERMS OF CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK WITH ON THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND WORKING WITH OUR COUNTIES -- TO MAKE SURE THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT STR TV'S THE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS ARE ON GETTING WEEK WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM APPROVAL SOMEONE FOR LICENSING DONE WE WE HAVE A ROLE IN THAT. AND SUPPORTING OUR COUNTIES WE'VE BEEN -- HOLDING -- A LOT OF TRAININGS AND CONVENIENCE AND I'M DOING A LOT OF WORK WITH -- WITH -- ARE COUNTY PARTNERS AND AND OUR OWN SISTER AGENCY -- TO TO MAKE SURE INFORMATION IS -- DISSEMINATED WE'VE DONE INFORMATION NOTICES -- AND AND AND HOLD RIGHT MEETINGS WERE WE TO IS THAT COME UP -- SO WE'RE WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY AND QUITE A OF AUSTIN A LOT OF TIME WORKING ON TO TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE POPULATION. ACCESS THE SERVICES I THINK WITH THAT [inaudible] CONCLUDE [inaudible] THANK YOU. AKA. KRISTA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AT THIS TIME I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD FOR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. VERY GOOD [inaudible] KIM SUDIRMAN. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CONSIDER MEN AND I AM A RETIRED BEING ABLE HEALTH DIRECTOR AND A CONSULTANT FOR THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. BY WARNER FIRST SAY AS A LICENSE CLINICIAN -- SERVING FOSTER KIDS IS JUST CRITICAL. TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS AND SO I'M JUST REALLY GLAD THAT THEY'RE HERE. AT THE TABLE TODAY. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M GONNA BE SHARING ITS KIND THAT I KNOW THAT WITH THIS WHOLE PANEL IS ABOUT THAT BIGGER PICTURE. YOU'RE GONNA HEAR THE NEXT PANEL ABOUT MORE DETAILS AND SO FIRST OF ALL I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AN EXAMPLE OF THE PROCESS WITH THE JURISDICTION COUNTY -- WHEN THERE IS A PLACEMENT FIGHT NEED AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT FOSTER CHILD OR YOUTH CANNOT -- RESIDING IN THE COUNTY SO THERE HAS TO BE A PLACEMENT OUT OF COUNTY AND USUALLY THAT'S RELATED AS MR ROSE SAID. THE SERVICE NEED LEVEL ISN'T AVAILABLE AND IN MANY COUNTIES THERE IS NOT -- THAT SUFFICIENT RESIDENTIAL NEEDS AS WELL FOR THE CHILD SO THEY DO HAVE TO BE PLACED ON A COUNTY -- THAT PART OF THAT PROCESS PARTICULARLY THAT WITH C. C. R. INCLUDES A CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM WHICH MUST INCLUDE THE CHILD OR YOUTH TO PARTICIPATE IF AGE APPROPRIATE. AND THE FAMILY -- TO PARTICIPATE IN WATER THE NEEDS THAT CAN -- THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED SO THAT THE PLACEMENT IS APPROPRIATE AND HELPFUL AS POSSIBLE AND TO AVOID. MULTIPLE PLACEMENTS SO THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL THE PLACING AGENCY AND IN THIS INSTANCE I USE -- CHILD WELFARE IS THE EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH WE KNOW OF COURSE THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM ALSO PLACES CHILDREN -- SO COUNTY A CHILD WELFARE -- PLACE IT DETERMINES THEIR TO AN INTER AGENCY MEDI -- THE TEAM HAS DISK NEEDS IN INTER AGENCY MAYBE WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE NEEDS IF IT'S THAT THE NEED OF A NOW USED TO BE CALLED A GROUP HOME. AND NOW -- ESSERE TP A SHORT TERM THERAPY SHORT TERM THERAPEUTIC -- RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM AND SO AS THEY GO INTO THAT LOOK FOR THAT I'M THE MIDDLE HEALTH PLAN WILL DO AN ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE MEDICAL NECESSITY IF THE CHILD HAS NOT ALREADY BEEN ASSESSED FOR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND THEN. THERE WILL BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER PERCENT OF TRANSFERS NEEDED AND I KNOW YOU'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT. SOME MORE IN THE IN THE NEXT PANEL -- THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN MAKES CAN MAKE A RECOMMENDATION AS PART OF THE INTERAGENCY PLACEMENT COMMITTEE OR THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM BUT DOES NOT HAVE A LEGAL AUTHORITY. TO FORMALLY -- IDENTIFY OR APPEAL ANY RECOMMENDATION THAT IS MADE AND THAT IS SOMETHING AS A TREATING AGENCY THAT IT'S BEEN A CONCERN OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN OTHER SETTINGS. BUT I WANT TO MENTION THAT BECAUSE AS THE RESPONSIBLE -- THE RESPONSIBLE IN IT'S BECAUSE OFTEN WE KNOW -- CLINICALLY IN RELATION TO THE CHILD NEEDS AND WOULD LIKE TO PLAY A ROLE IN THAT IN IN SOMETIMES IN A DEEPER WAY THAN WE CURRENTLY ARE ABLE. TO SO IF THE CHILD IS PLACED OUT OF COUNTY THEN THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN -- AND THE CHILD IS PRESUMPTIVELY TRANSFERRED THEN THE HOST MENTAL HEALTH PLAN HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO RANGE FOR AND PROVIDE. FOR THE MEDICALLY NECESSARY SPECIAL. SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT MIS READ MS GREEN WHICH WAS TALKING ABOUT. AND SO. I'M THEY RECEIVE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY PRIOR TO SERVICES IT'S SO IMPORTANT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS WAS MENTIONED IS A PART OF HEALTH SERVICES. AND SO BEFORE SERVICES CAN BE CAN CONSENT FOR TREATMENT. INFORMED CONSENT FOR TREATMENT AS WITH ANY HEALTH SERVICE MENTAL HEALTH IS A PART OF HEALTH SERVICES NEEDS TO BE GAME AN ASSESSMENT WHICH HOPEFULLY HAS BEEN DONE ALREADY. NEEDS TO THE HOST MENTAL HEALTH PLAN IS TO RECEIVE AN AUTHORIZATION NEEDS TO BE GIVEN AGAIN AS IT WOULD IN ANY HEALTH SERVICE. WHETHER YOU NEED SURGERY OR WITH YOU NEED SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE HEALTH PLAN AUTHORIZES -- THE SERVICES SO TO AGAIN TO DETERMINE MEDICAL NECESSITY WE ALWAYS WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE COURT APPROVED JB TO TWENTY FORM WHICH BASICALLY ALLOWS. IF IF MEDICATIONS ARE PRESCRIBED REST. AND SO THOSE ARE SOME DOCUMENTS THAT ARE VERY CRITICAL BEFORE SERVICES CAN REALLY BEGIN. AND THEN THE PRACTITIONER WHO'S GOING TO WORK WITH THE CHILD OR YOUTH. WORKS WITH THEM TO DEVELOP A CLIENT PLAN TALK ABOUT SERVICES TALK ABOUT FREQUENCY AND SET THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. AS THE PROCESS BEGINS. SO THEN WE GET THE CONTRACTS AND OF COURSE THERE'S MONEY INVOLVED -- AND SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE NEEDS -- WE DEVELOP CONTRACTS AND WE TALKED ABOUT -- THERE ARE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS THAT PROVIDE THE SERVICES DIRECTLY AND THEY'RE ALSO VERY MANY COUNTIES MOST COUNTIES CONTRACT OUT. MUCH OF THEIR FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THEIR MEDI CAL SPECIALTY MIDDLE HEALTH SERVICES PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE CHILDREN WHO ARE IN. RESIDENTIAL CARE -- IN A S. T. R. T. P. AND MANY TIMES IN -- IN A FOSTER HOME AS WELL. IN A RESOURCE FAMILY HOME AND SO ON WE CANNOT DO THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLAN CANNOT DO THEIR SERVICES WITHOUT OUR PARTNER. THE COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS THAT IS SO CRITICAL AND SO WE DO CONTRACT WITH THEM AND SO THERE'S A WHOLE PROCESS FOR NEGOTIATING RATES. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT COSTS THE PROJECTION OF AMOUNT OF SERVICES BOTH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL CHILD BUT ALSO. OVERALL IF MOST COMMONLY PROVIDERS SERVE MORE THAN ONE CHILD -- SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PROJECTED AMOUNT OF MINUTES AND THAT'S HOW YOU COME UP WITH THE RATE. AND IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM THERE ARE MULTIPLE KINDS OF SERVICES SO UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A RATE FOR EACH KIND OF SERVICE. SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE CONTRACTING PROCESS IS NOT A SIMPLE PROCESS AND OUR OUR PARTNERS WILL BE PROBABLY MENTIONING THAT WHEN IN THE NEXT PANEL. BUT THAT'S KIND OF THE PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING THE CONTRACT THERE STILL HAS TO ALL OF THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MAKES THE DECISION AND AUTHORIZES AND APPROVED THE CONTRACT AND SIGN IT. THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES THAT ARE ABLE TO DO -- BROADER AGREEMENTS THAT ALLOWS HIM INDIVIDUAL FLEXIBILITY ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. AND SO DOES IT TO COUNTY BY COUNTY DECISION AND SO AS YOU AS IS REALLY SHOULD MENTION THERE ARE FIFTY SIX MENTAL HEALTH PLANS SO THERE'S A LOT OF NEGOTIATION BACK AND FORTH. AND THEN SO JUST A COMMENT ABOUT FUNDING -- SO MENTAL HEALTH PLANS THE WAY THEY'RE REIMBURSED FROM FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION IS A MUST INCUR THE COST FIRST IT'S A REIMBURSEMENT SO THEY MUST PAY THE PROVIDER WHETHER THE PROVIDER IS THEIR OWN COUNTY EMPLOYEE. OR WHETHER IT IS -- AND CONTRACTED PROVIDER THEY MUST FIRST PAY THEM AND THEN THEY CAN SUBMIT CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENT SO AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A PROCESS THAT TAKES SOME TIME. SO FOR A CONTRACT PROVIDER IT CAN TAKE AROUND AND THIS IS AN AVERAGE THREE TO FOUR MONTHS BY THE TIME A CHILD SO. IT THE PROCESS TAKES SOME TIME SO IF IT IF A CHILD RECEIVE SERVICES IN MONTH. ONE AT THE END OF MONTH ONE THE PROVIDER WILL INVOICE THE COUNTY IN MONTH TO TO BE REIMBURSED. IN MY THREE AND FOR THE COUNTY PROCESS BACK AND FORTH WITH THE PROVIDER TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S LINED UP ALL THE EYES ARE DOT AND HE'S OUR CROSS TO SUBMIT THE CLAIMS. AND SO THAT'S IN MONTH THREE AND FOUR AND SOMETIMES AT THAT PROCESS GOES QUICKLY AND SOMETIMES ARE SOME PUMPS AND YOU HAVE TO DO SOME NEGOTIATION. AND MONTH FOREIGN FIVE THEN THE COUNTY ALL OF THEIR PROVIDERS AND THEIR OWN COUNTY EMPLOYEES AND THEY CAN SUBMIT A CLAIM. TO THE STATE THROUGHTHE I. T. W. S. SYSTEM AT DH CS AND TEY THAT IS HOW THEY ARE BEGINNING TO DRAW DOWN THEN. THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION SO THAT'S THE 50% THAT THEY ARE REIMBURSED FOR THE HAVE INCURRED. INITIALLY. THE STATE WILL THEN PROCESS THE CLAIMS THAT CAN TAKE. ON THAT MOVES YOU INTO MONTH FIVE OR SIX AGAIN BACK AND FORTH DEPENDING ON HOW THE PROCESS GOES. AND THEN SOMEWHERE IN MONTHS SEVEN EIGHT OR NINE AGAIN DEPENDING ON THE PROCESS THE COUNTY IS REIMBURSE THE 50%. FROM MONTH. ONE THAT'S FROM THE FIRST FROM THE FOR SERVICE SO THAT'S KIND OF HOW THE FUNDING GOES -- THE OTHER 50% COUNTY USE THE REALIGNMENT THEY RECEIVED -- BETWEEN. NINETEEN NINETY NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT TWENTY ELEVEN AND THEN THERE ARE WITH SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER CC ARE. THERE ARE SOME PROP THIRTY RESPONSIBILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET THAT THE COUNTIES ALSO RECEIVE SO THAT'S KIND OF A REAL QUICK -- FINANCIAL PIECE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH COSTS AND THEN JUST A QUICK COMMENT ABOUT CHALLENGES -- AS YOU CAN SEE MET BASED ON THAT TIME FRAME THE MENTAL HEALTH PART PLANTS ARE OPERATING ON PREVIOUS REVENUES THEY'RE NOT OPERATING IN THE YEAR. THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING SERVICES BASED ON THE REVENUE THEY RECEIVE THE CAP BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT YET. SO THAT IS JUST THE COUNTIES ARE USED TO THAT BUT THAT IS THE PROCESS THINKER THE COST THERE'S A CEILINGS WITH THE GENERAL FUND THAT THEY HAVE -- WORK THROUGH WITH THEIR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND SO THEY HAVE A BUDGET CEILING SOME COUNTIES GET GENERAL FUND FROM THE COUNTY SOME MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. GET GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FROM THE COUNTIES SOME DO SUPERVISORS SO CASH FLOW CAN BE A CHALLENGE AT TIMES AND SO THOSE THINGS AS WE NOW LOOK AT CROSSING COUNTY LINES. WITH PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER THERE'S AN IMPACT BECAUSE NOW THERE ARE AS WE SET TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THERE ARE. COUNTIES WHERE THERE ARE NO -- RESIDENTIAL GROUP HOMES FOR FOSTER HOMES LOCALLY AND SO KIDS ARE PLACED AT A COUNTY AND SO THERE'S AN IMPACT THERE. AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT NEVADA COUNTY WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO DATE THEY HAVE TWENTY EIGHT KIDS -- PLACE IN THEIR COUNTY UNDER PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER WHICH REPRESENTS SIXTEEN COUNTIES -- SO THAT'S HOW MANY OF THE COUNTIES ARE FUNCTIONING TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS FROM THE I ADDED IT WANTED TO TOUCH ON WHAT IT'S IT'S MISS SODERMAN CORRECT A THE A THINKING OUT IT I MEAN I I HEAR IT'S SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS ON THE FAST SIDE AND I'VE HEARD OF BACKLOGS OF OVER TWO TO THREE YEARS. AND THAT'S TO ME THAT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE. AND YOU KNOW YOU WOULD THINK BY NOW WE WOULD HAVE HAD SOME KIND OF A STATEWIDE STANDARD SO EVERYBODY'S TALKING TO EACH OTHER BACK AND FORTH AND I I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT BUT SOMETHING AND I'M INTERESTED IN TALKING WITH THE CHAIR. ABOUT FIGURING OUT SOMETHING AND MAYBE AS A COMMITTEE BILL. TO FIX SOME OF THESE KINKS SO WE CAN HAVE THE ACROSS THE BOARD FOR OUR YOUTH AND ACTUALLY HAVE THE REIMBURSEMENTS COMING IN ON TIME. MISTER ROSE READ I I SAW HANDLE IT FOR YOU KNOW I I GRABBED THE MIKE AND THEN REALIZE THAT YOU WOULD THINK I WOULD RESPOND BY. BUT TECHNICALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS -- IS THOUGH THAT AS HAS BEEN SKRILLEX DESCRIBED AS THE FOR IS THAT PAYER FOR THAT SO I I CAN'T SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF AND AND I I'M I'M I'M AWARE I'M ALSO ON BUDGETS OF ONE AND I MEAN I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAYBE -- IS SUPERMAN MIGHT NOT REALIZE BUT I'M HIS BECAUSE SHE'S NOT INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT DEAL WITH -- TO THE BASE AND THE GROWTH -- ALLOCATION DISCUSSIONS FOR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUB ACCOUNT -- BUT WE EVERY YEAR AND FOR IT FOR CERTAIN QUITE A FEW YEARS SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THAT RELY MOSTLY DOWN NO THAT'S FINE -- BUT EVER SINCE THEN -- FROM SINCE REALIGNMENT THIS REALIGNMENT -- TO WITHOUT ANNUAL DISCUSSIONS AND IT'S IT'S WITH -- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE THE C. SACK -- CALPERS EXHORTATION OF COUNTIES -- HAVE EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE ALLOCATION AND SO -- TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES WE ACTUALLY WERE ABLE -- TO COME UP WITH A METHODOLOGY -- THAT JUST STARTED THIS PAST YEAR OR TWO WHERE WE WERE WERE ABLE TO USE -- WE USE CLAIMS AS PART OF IT -- WHICH WHICH INSTRUMENT TALKED ABOUT -- BUT WE'RE ALSO USING -- FOSTER CARE AND DISABLED EIGHT CODES IN MEDI CAL TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE OTHER HOUSE SO THAT WE CAN GET THAT MONEY OUT TO THE COUNTIES SO. JUST JUST TO KIND OF UPDATE ON THAT PIECE OF IT BECAUSE THAT'S THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENED RECENTLY SOME. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT -- MY AT MY OTHER QUESTION AND IT'S IT'S JUST KIND OF MORE TO KIND OF KEEP US ON THE SAME PAGE THE MY UNDERSTANDING AND BASED ON YOUR TESTIMONY -- YOU KNOW IF IF THE CHILDREN ARE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE BUT OF SERVICES. THE COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY EITHER I I KNOW ONE OF MY COUNTIES LITERAL ONLY HAS -- ONE FOSTER HOME THAT DOES SIGN LANGUAGE -- FOR SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS SO. SHE'S COMPLETELY BLOCKED. AND SO TO GET AND I KNOW -- BECAUSE I ACTUALLY KNOW HER THROUGH ANOTHER ORGANIZATION BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S TIMES WERE THE COUNTY POLITICAL CAN USE WHOLE THIS KIT FOR ENACT. IN AND THEN WE GET INTO THE GROUP HOME SCENARIO AND I KNOW A LOT OF THE CRITICISMS WE GET WITH THE GROUP HOMES IS YOU KNOW THESE ARE KIND OF TRAINING CAMPS FOR THE BAD KIDS. AND YOU DON'T WANT A NEW KID AGO NECESSARILY THERE -- OFF THE BAT BUT IN SOME CASES THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS -- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET A HOLD OF ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER OR SOMETHING ELSE. DELICIOUS I MEAN FOR FOR ME AS A DAD ABILITIES AND THINGS IT'S IT'S VERY CONCERNING -- THAT WE HAVE SO MANY COUNTIES OF SPECIAL IN OUR RURAL AREAS -- AND THEN READING OVER YOU KNOW. WITH WITH KATIE -- EVEN IN LA WERE HAVING THESE PROBLEMS SO IT TO ME IT'S SOMETHING MORE IS GOING TO BE DONE -- TO ENSURE THAT THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING. SO ON DEFINITELY OPEN TO SPEAKING WITH ALL OF THE ON WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT. YES. I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT -- YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE A HUGE SHORTAGE OF FOSTER HOMES NOW REFER TO AS RESOURCE FAMILY HOMES -- THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY MANY STELLAR -- RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES TODAY THAT ARE IN CONGREGATE CARE AND OF COURSE WE WANT THREE CC ARE TO BE ABLE TO BRING KIDS INTO A FAMILY SENDING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHICH WE THAT THE NUMBERS HAVE REALLY GREATLY DECREASED CONSIDERABLY. BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE TIMES UNFORTUNATELY WHERE CHILDREN DO NEED TO BE IN CONGREGATE CARE INSTEAD OF IN A FAMILY HOME AND WE HAVE SOME STELLAR ONE SO I DO REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. WE HAVE A SHORTAGE BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY COUNTIES THAT DON'T EVEN HAVE ONE RESIDENTIAL FACILITY IN THEIR COUNTY AND THERE'S A NEED FOR THAT AS WELL. WERE ALSO WORKING ON THAT WITH THE LETTERMAN COALITION FOR SOME HOUSING THINGS. IF I MAY I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS BRIEFLY THE PORTLAND AND SO. OFTEN HISTORICALLY THERE IS A LOT OF THE WORK HAS BEEN AND I'M KIND OF ROUTINE AND KIND OF REGULAR RECRUITMENT -- KIND OF G. THAT I WHAT I OFTEN THINK OF HIS GENERAL RECRUITMENT -- GOING -- TO LOCATIONS AND TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO -- WHO -- ARE HISTORICALLY KNOWN FOR HELPING OTHERS AND AND RECRUITING FROM THAT BASE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED RECENTLY -- ACTUALLY NOT SO RECENTLY BUT OR WREAKING CONTINUING TO LEARN ABOUT RECENTLY IS REALLY THAT NEED TO FOCUS ON CHILD SPECIFIC RECRUITMENT AND ESPECIALLY FOR WHEN YOU HAVE -- YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HAVE -- SOME PRETTY -- A PARTICULAR NEED OR OFTEN WITH -- WITH TEENAGERS -- PARTICULARLY AS WELL SO I THINK OUR CAR COUNTIES ARE OFTEN -- YOU KNOW DOING TWO THINGS DOING RECRUITMENT AT TWO LEVELS ONE IS KIND OF A GENERAL RECRUITMENT TO KEEP. A NEW FAMILIES ENGAGE IN THE SYSTEM AS AS OTHER FAMILIES -- ADOPTING LEAVE OR TAKE GUARDIANSHIP AND A RENEWED -- NEED AND COMMITMENT FOR A CHILD SPECIFIC RECRUITMENT TO TO ADDRESS THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF OF MANY YOUNG PEOPLE. THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER STUFF. THANK YOU AND I'M AND AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT SOME OF THESE PIECES ARE ARE STARTING TO WORK TOGETHER BUT I REMAINED A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED. BECAUSE WE'VE TRIED TO PUT SOME OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PIECES INTO. THE CC ARE UP FRONT AND THAT HAS BEEN REALLY BAD A CHALLENGE IN IMPLEMENTATION AND HEARING FROM SOME OF THE COUNTIES IN HEARING FROM SOME. OF THE FOLKS WHO REALLY TRYING TO MAKE THIS WORK. WITH THIS NOTION WITH THE BEHAVIOR HOUSE SYSTEM REALLY JUST WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT CASES ARE DIAGNOSED CIVIL THAT THAT THERE'S BEEN. MORE OF AN EMPHASIS ON CONTROLLING UTILIZATION REALLY THAN BEING CREATIVE AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERY KID WHO COMES IN THE SYSTEM BECAUSE BY DEFINITION EVERY KID WHO COMES IN THE SYSTEM. HAS SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY RISE TO LEVEL DIAGNOSIS NOTED NOR SHOULD IT BUT THEY ARE THEY'RE COMING WITH TRAUMA. AND EVERY STEP THAT WE MAKE THESE ADD TO THAT TRAUMA. AND WE LOOK MORE BROADLY AT THE SYSTEM WITH ALL THE MHSAA MONEY THAT THE COUNTY CITY OR SITTING ON THAT THE STATE'S SITTING ON AT IT SEEMS ALMOST THAT WE HAVE SO MANY HURDLES AND GATES. TO GETTING SERVICES PROVIDED TO KIDS WHEN THEY NEED IT AS THEY NEED IT. THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BECOME OVERLY CUMBERSOME. I KNOW SOME COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING GETTING ASKED YEAR TEEPEES THE LICENSES THAT THEY NEED AND AND THEN MAKING SOME DECISIONS. OF WHERE THOSE. FACILITIES NEED TO GO AND POTENTIALLY EVEN LICENSING S. YOUR TV'S OUT OF COUNTY FOR THEIR OWN KIDS. WHEN SOMETIMES THEY HAVE SOME OF THOSE SOME POTENTIALLY GOOD PROVIDERS INSIDE AND SOME OF THAT'S LOCAL POLITICS AND? AND OTHER DISCONNECT BETWEEN SOME OF THE SYSTEMS THAT NEED TO WORK BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET OURSELVES. OVER THOSE. CHALLENGES AND ADD OVER THOSE CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON THAT SAME PAGE HELPING COUNTIES IMPLEMENT PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS NECESSARY. GETTING THEM TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN BE SPENDING MONEY IN THE WAY THAT WE ENVISIONED WITH WHAT C. C. R. WAS WAS ULTIMATELY TRYING TO DO AND I AM JUST NOT SURE THAT THAT MENTAL HEALTH PEAS. HAS IT IS JELLING IN THE WAY OR AS QUICKLY AS WE HAD INTENDED UNDER CC ARE SO THAT'S A PIECE THAT I THINK WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO WORK ON AND IF WE CAN START TO RETHINK THE SYSTEM MAY IT'S OF THE KIDS. THEN WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB IN SOME OF THE MORE RURAL AREAS WHERE THERE HAVEN'T TRADITIONALLY BAD. BAD AS MUCH SUPPORTS. AND YOU KNOW THE COMMENTS THAT. THERE ARE SOME GOOD COVERAGE CARE FACILITIES YET POTENTIALLY BUT THERE ARE SO MANY THAT ARE NOT GOOD FOR KIDS. THAT'S WHY THESE HUGE PUSH AWAY AND MORE FOR INDIVIDUALIZED PLACEMENT AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SYSTEM OF BEST YEAR TEEPEES WHERE WE TO BRING KIDS AND GIVE THEM A HOUSE OR IS A NEED GIVEN THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. AND THEN. AND CONTINUE TO HELP THEM IN THE US HERE WHO GET THE READY FOR PLACEMENTS YEAH WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE THOSE PLACEMENTS IN EACH COUNTY. FOR THE SERVICES NEED TO GO AND WRAPAROUND AND REALLY HELP THAT CHILD ONCE THEY'RE OUT AND THE FAMILIES BECAUSE AS WE ARE AT THIS ROSE I ABSOLUTELY AGREE AND THAT THAT CHILD SPECIFIC RECRUITMENT. BECAUSE SOME OF THESE FAMILIES NEED TO BE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE KIDS THAT THEY'RE TAKING IN THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT THEY'RE HAVING. AND THAT'S WHY WE TEND TO FOCUS ON KIND OF A MID LEVEL KIDS AND I'M NOT SURE WE WE HAVE REALLY ADDRESS THE MOST CHALLENGING DIFFICULT. KIDS TO SERVE. IN THIS PROCESS IS WE REALLY TRY AND SORT THROUGH. WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR AGES KIDS SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO GO I'M I'M? GLAD A VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT YOU FEEL YOU MAKING PROGRESS IN WORKING ACROSS AGENCIES. BUT I WOULD ASK THAT WE REALLY START TO FOCUS EVEN MORE ON THAT THAT WE MAKE SURE WE'RE ABLE TO SPEND THE MONEY AND ASSIST THE COUNTIES. FOR KIDS AS THEY COME INTO THE SYSTEM THAT THEY GET THE HELP THEY NEED. AS THEY NEEDED AS THEY PERCENT. GIVEN THE THE COMPLICATIONS THAT THEY HAVE AND JUST DOESN'T QUITE SEEM TO BE WORKING THAT WELL IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. TO BREAK DOWN SOME OF THAT. THE RED TAPE THE THE OLD WAYS OF DOING THINGS THE RELUCTANCE. TO ABLE TO APPLY THOSE MONIES AS AND WHEN NEEDED THEN WE NEED TO BE A PART OF OF THAT CONVERSATION TO SIDE I THINK SO LONG THE WAY WE SEE SIERRA FERMENTATION. AND AND A LOT OF IT HAVING TO DO WITH. NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTANDING OR BEING ON THE SAME PAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE WAY SERVICES REALLY NEED TO GET THE LIVER AND AND I THINK WE NEED TO ALL KIND OF WRAP THAT UP AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING AS RESPONSIVE AS POSSIBLE. GETTING MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SUPPORTED AND FUNCTIONING AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SERVE KIND OF ACROSS CALIFORNIA INCLUDING IN RURAL COUNTIES WHERE. IT'S BEEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SERVE. BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALWAYS HAD THE ABILITY. TO TO MEET THOSE NEEDS AND SO WITH THAT BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET THE SYSTEM FUNCTIONING AND FUNCTIONING SMOOTHLY EVEN IN PLACES WHERE WE KNOW IT CAN WORK. AND THAT'LL HELP US GET OUT TO THE MORE RURAL AREAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY. TO TO ADDRESS ALL THESE KIDS SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK I'VE I JUST WANT TO KEEP. THE PADDLE DOWN. KEEP WORKING MAKE SURE WE ARE ENGAGE WITH THINGS THAT THAT THAT NEED TO BE HAPPENING BUT I ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE ARE NOT [inaudible] BLOCKING. TO JUST TRY TO CONTROL UTILIZATION THAT WE'RE ABLE TO BE CREATIVE. THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET THE SERVICES WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED ADDRESS THE KIDS ISSUES AS THEY AS THEY COME UP BECAUSE THERE'S NOT THAT MANY KIDS ULTIMATELY STATEWIDE IF WE CAN'T SERVE THESE KIDS WE REALLY CAN'T SERVE ANY KIDS. THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS THE POPULATION WE HAVE TO BE MOST RESPONSIVE TO AND I THINK THAT THAT HELPS US. SERVE ALL KIDS AND WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CREATIVE MAY BE AND HOW WE PULL ALL THAT TOGETHER SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU DOCTOR STONE DR CHOI. YEAH I KNOW TODAY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT THE I HAVE A MORE LITTLE BIT -- GENERAL QUESTION AS SECURITY IS -- TO ONE OF MY DISTRICT ARE STAFF MEMBERS SO THEY CARE ABOUT TWO BORIAS SO FORM NUMBER BEER SO THIRTY FOUR YEAR OR SO. SO -- INDUSTRY IS TALKING ABOUT THE ADOPTING THE CHILDREN SO. IN CALIFORNIA I WONDER WHAT THE ORDER NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE HOMES. AND THE IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE A NUMBER FOR ORANGE COUNTY. AND THIRD QUESTION IS -- IF THE CURRENT FOSTER PARENT OR A TOP SPEED OF CHILDREN. THEN DO THEY GIVE UP OR WHATEVER -- THE GOVERNMENT'S RENDON YOUTH AND FOSTER CARE IN THE IN THIS IN THE STATE -- A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE -- TOUCHED BY OUR SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR NOT ALL IN FOSTER CARE -- BUT IN OTHER OTHER SETTINGS AS WELL WAS ROUTE WITH REGARD TO THE ORANGE COUNTY NUMBER I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME NOW BUT BY. THE END OF THE HEARING I CAN HAVE IT -- I CAN PULL IT UP ON MY PHONE ACTUALLY -- AND WITH RICK OF WITH RESPECT TO THE THE SUPPORT -- THAT ADOPTIVE FAMILIES GET -- COUPLE THINGS NOTES SO. TYPICALLY ON ON ALMOST ALWAYS -- WHEN A FAMILY ADOPTS THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE ADOPTION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THE ADOPTIONS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE FAMILY -- AT AT ROUGHLY THE SAME RATE AS THE FOSTER CARE PAYMENT YOUNG PEOPLE CONTINUE TO OR THAT THAT CHILDREN TO CONTINUE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE ALLAH CETERA SO. THE OVER THE YEARS THAT VARIOUS LEGISLATURES HAVE DONE THEIR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS THAT THAT THERE AREN'T FISCAL INNOCENCE OR DISINCENTIVES FOR FAMILIES TO TO ADOPT SO ROUGHLY THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT IS IS IS THE SAME. OKAY THEN FINANCIALLY -- THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME ABOUT THE WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES -- OF THE FOSTER PARENTS. OR BECOMING ADOPTIVE PARENTS. SO THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY FINANCIAL DIFFERENCE THEY WOULD GET END UP WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT AS IF THEY WERE AS THEY WERE RECEIVING -- WHEN THE CHILD WAS A FOSTER CHILD AT AFTER ADOPTIONS THROUGH THE ADOPTIONS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM? THEIR MEDI CAL WOULD STAY INTACT AS WELL SO THAT HAVE. THAT THE DIFFERENCE IT POTENTIALLY IS THERE -- THAT NO LONGER GETTING DIRECT SERVICES FROM EITHER THE THAT FROM THE COUNTY IN TERMS OF A CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES BECAUSE ONCE THE ADOPTION AND IT IN IS DETERMINED TO BE KIND OF A PERMANENCY AND AN EXIT FROM OUR SYSTEM. SO THERE'S NO LONGER COURT INVOLVEMENT AND NO LONGER -- COUNTY -- SOCIAL WORK VISITS -- AND AT BUT AS THE AS THE BOTH THE THE CASE WORKER AND THE ADOPTIONS WORKER CONTINUE TO TO LINK. FAMILIES TO THE SUPPORTS THEY WILL NEED IN THE IN THE IN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT BY THE TIME THAT THERE'S NO LONGER -- SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT IF I CAN USE THAT TERM THE FAMILY HAS AND KNOWS WHERE THEY CAN GET OTHER ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS HAS THE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES -- THEY NEED AND EVERY TWO YEARS THEY CAN CON -- AND RENEGOTIATE THE ADOPTIONS ASSISTANCE PAYMENT RATES OF SOMETHING SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGES YOUR DOCTOR YOUNG CHILD -- AND THEN SOMETHING IN LATENCY OR TEENAGERS HAPPENS THAT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT -- THEN THERE IS THE ABILITY FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO BE PROVIDED TO THAT FAMILY SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE SERVICES OR OTHER SUPPORT FOR THAT YOUNG KID. AS THEY GROW INTO ADULTHOOD JUST SO THAT WE KEEP IT ON TRACK WITH TODAY'S HEARING DOCTOR CHOI -- THE A TO GO ALONG WITH THAT QUESTION WHAT ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS TO THOSE CHILDREN THAT ARE ADOPTED. OKAY AT THE SCHOOL QUESTION. AS I AS I MET A TOSSED TO THE SIDE OF THE TABLE THERE ARE EAGERLY AWAITING THAT BUT I WOULD JUST SAY BECAUSE OF THE THE THE MEDI CAL CONTINUATION AND BENEFIT SHOULD TRICK ARE THE SAME I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD. I DO WANT TO ADD BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL PARTICULARLY FOR THEM MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- THERE IS A TENDENCY FOR ADOPTIVE PARENTS TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR HEALTH PLAN. THEIR PRIVATE HEALTH PLAN WILL PROVIDE -- THAN MEDI CAL AND I THINK MEDI CAL GETS A BAD RAP AT TIMES BUT I'LL TELL YOU IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. I AS A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR IN BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I STERN DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDED WAY MORE. MORE FREQUENT MORE SERVICES AND BETTER SERVICES THAT I COULD HAVE EVER GOTTEN FROM MY OWN CHILDREN SO THEY ARE CONTINUE TO BE ELIGIBLE AND WE ALWAYS ENCOURAGE ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE BACK IN THE COUNTY. FOR THE PARENTS TO KEEP UP THE MEDI CAL STAY INVOLVED WITH THAT EVEN IF THEY ALSO -- ENGAGE THEIR HEALTH PLAN. THANK YOU SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD COMMERCIAL FOR MEDI CAL RIGHT THERE. JUST. COULD I ADD ONE THING TO THAT -- ONE THING. WE HAVE RECENTLY PUBLISHED A SERIES OF GUIDES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS TO UNDERSTAND THE NUANCES THAT -- ADOPTED CHILDREN -- EXPERIENCE AND SO I'D BE HAPPY TO MAKE THAT THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU HEIGHT THAT APPRECIATE THAT -- MS FRIEDMAN AND THEN MR COOLEY. THANK YOU FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU OFFER I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO WHICH IS. SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND ALSO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AT TIMES HEARTBREAKING SO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING THE ADVOCATES THAT YOU ARE -- I JUST WANTED TO YOU KNOW I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN THIS FIELD BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION YOU ALL ARE. SO PLEASE TAKE THIS WITH A HUGE GRAIN OF SALT -- BUT I DID WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE JUST TO GIVE YOU MAY BE SOME INSIGHT ABOUT. THE FALLING INTEREST OF PEOPLE TO BECOME FOSTER PARENTS -- I SPENT TWO YEARS BECOMING A FOSTER PARENT. THROUGH LA COUNTY -- IN OUR QUEST TO ADOPT A CHILD. AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST FRUSTRATING AND DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE EVER HAD WITH ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY -- EVERY TIME WE HAD SOMEONE COME TO OUR INSPECTOR HOME WHICH WAS A MULTITUDE OF TIMES THEY CONSTANTLY WILL COME UP WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN SEEMING VERY ARBITRARY -- REQUIREMENTS FOR US -- EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE REQUIREMENTS YOU KNOW THAT WOULD HAVE COST US TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR HOME -- I WAS TOLD AFTER GOING THROUGH THAT I ASKED TOO MANY QUESTIONS AND CLEARLY I WAS NOT THE KIND OF PERSON THAT THEY WANTED IN THEIR SYSTEM. AND OF YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER ADOPTION IS GOOD OR BAD BUT IT WAS BEEN MADE VERY CLEAR TO ME AT THE TIME I AND I THINK SUBSEQUENTLY REINFORCED OVER AND OVER TO ME. THAT THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT VALUE ADOPTION. THAT THAT'S NOT THAT'S THE LAST RESORT AS FAR AS THEY'RE CONCERNED AND THAT MESSAGE IS GIVEN TO A POTENTIALLY ADOPTIVE PARENTS. AND YOU KNOW BEING TOLD THAT YOU'RE SORT OF THE IF EVERYTHING ELSE FAILS MAYBE WILL CONSIDER YOU BUT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF THIS CHILD AND WE EXPECT YOU TO LOVE THIS TRIAL BUT WE ALSO EXPECT YOU. TO FAVOR UNIV NOT JUST RE INVOCATION REPLACEMENT WITH THIS FAMILY MEMBERS -- I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE WHETHER THAT'S GOOD FOR THE CHILD OR NOT BUT I DEFINITELY BELIEVE IT ENDS UP WITH A LOT OF PARENTS NOT. NOT WANTING TO GO INTO THE SYSTEM WHO WERE POTENTIALLY GOOD PARENTS. A LOT OF CHILDREN BEING SEPARATED FROM PARENTS AFTER. ONE TO THREE YEARS. I'VE SEEN IT MYSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN I'M BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. AND AGAIN I AM NOT GONNA I THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO HAVE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S APPROPRIATE ARE GOOD FOR THOSE CHILDREN OR ANY OF THOSE ISSUES AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR COMPLICATED AND NUANCED. THERE'S LOTS OF PERSPECTIVES BUT FROM A SOMEONE WHO SPENT YEARS YOU KNOW IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN YEARS AGAIN ADOPTING MY CHILD -- I I I I I I HAVE DEALT WHY HAVE COME IN CONTACT WITH SO MANY PARENTS WHO HAD THEIR HEART BROKEN -- IN THE YOU KNOW ON THERE AND FROM THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SO IT'S TRAUMATIZED CHILDREN AND A LOTTA TRAUMATIZED ADULTS OUT THERE AND I. IF YOUR RATES OF PEOPLE WANTING TO DO THIS ARE FALLING. AFTER DOING TRYING TO DO IT MYSELF I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT SURPRISE I'M SURPRISED ANYONE DOES IT AT ALL SO THAT'S JUST. MY PERCENT MY MY PERSPECTIVE AGAIN THANKS FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY WHO IS ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE OFFER FOSTER YOUTH. WELL ON THAT I WOULD JUST SAY AMEN TO MS FRIEDMAN -- YOU KNOW STORIES ON THIS POINT OF HOW TRAUMATIC FOR PROSPECTIVE ADOPTIVE PARENTS -- ACTION -- COUPLE RIGHT NOW WHO SORT OF WE'RE LOOKING TO ADOPT AND AND IF HAVE SORT OF GOT. THE WOBBLE OF THEY'RE LOOKING TO ADOPT AND YET. SEEMINGLY OUT OF THE BLUE THE AT THE OPTION DISAPPEARS. A PAINFUL AND I AND I GET IT I HEAR FROM PEOPLE IN THAT. THE MOST STRIKING ONE FOR ME ACTUALLY IS -- COUPLE I KNEW. WHO ARE CARING FOR CHILD LOOKING TO ADOPT [inaudible] OF WENT TO WITH THEIR WHOLE FAMILY TO DISNEYLAND. AND WERE TRAVELING DOWN FOR I BELIEVE IT WAS THE THANKSGIVING WEEKEND ONE YEAR. AND GOTTA CALL AT ABOUT TWO THIRTY IN THE AFTERNOON WATER SOUTHBOUND ON I.. FIVE FROM SOMEBODY INFORMING THEM THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE THIS CHILD BACK IN A SECOND COURT ROOM ON TUESDAY. BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING ELSEWHERE. AND TO ALL APPEARANCES IT WAS SOMEBODY THAT WAS SORT OF CARING THEIR QUEUE ON A WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON BEFORE THANKSGIVING. HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE TALKING TO PEOPLE ACTUALLY BEEN CARE FOR THIS CHILD FIRST EMPEROR LOOKING TO ADOPT. AND WHAT MADE THE STORY STAND OUT OF MY MIND BECAUSE HE SPENT THREE DAYS IN THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH. AND THAT CHILD WHO WAS WITH HIM DIDN'T APPEAR IN ANY OF THE PICTURES. IF I COULD JUST WAS SO TRAUMATIC FOR THEM. THEY THEY STARTED EDITING RIGHT AWAY -- BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT. THE POINT I DEFINITELY THINK. WE DO NEED PEOPLE. WHO ARE? ON BEHALF OF KIDS WHO WERE IN THESE. DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE YOU DO NEED PEOPLE OF GOOD CARING HEARTS -- FOR ALL THE CRAP THAT COMES DOWN. EIGHTY A FOSTER PARENT A GOOD FOSTER PARENT IS SOMEBODY WHO'S BASICALLY SAYING. THEY'RE WILLING TO TRY TO HELP A CHILD GROW WHOLE. IN LOVE'S OVERFLOW. BRING THAT CHILD IN THE HOUSE AND SO. THEY HAVE PEOPLE WHO WERE WILLING TO BE THAT PERSON. WHO TAKE THEMSELVES OUT OF THE SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY A GREAT DISCREDIT TO LOTS OF KIDS -- SO I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE -- PROVIDE HER FIRST PERSON ACCOUNT BUT I CERTAINLY. HEAR HEAR THOSE STORIES SOME PEOPLE MYSELF. ARE I ACTUALLY JUST WANTED TO SAY. I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR CALIFORNIA -- BEING HERE. I THINK IN THIS WHOLE SYSTEM THE THE ONE QUESTION I WOULD ASK IS. TO WHAT EXTENT HAVE WE IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY. OR CAN WE IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY. IN SOME OF THESE RURAL COUNTIES. FIND A WAY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. TWO STRUPPER CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT TO THE LOCAL INS LOOKS LIKE THE THINGS THAT. IF YOU'RE IN MODOC COUNTY OR TAME A COUNTY OR DEL NORTE COUNTY. WHAT TO THE LOCALS WHO HAVE A CONCERN IN THIS AREA WHO BE SORT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WANT? TO HELP KIDS GROW UP HOLDEN LOVES OVER FOR THE TYPE OF PERSON. WHAT DID THEY SEE IS THE THING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT THEY COULD DO MOST DIRECTLY? TO HELP SOLVE THE IMPLEMENTATION SOME THESE PROGRAMS. I THINK -- MY COLLEAGUE MISTER STONE HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN KIND OF FRAME THIS CONVERSATION WERE SPENDING YEARS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT IT. BRING IT DOWN THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND IT'S GREAT FOR US IN SACRAMENTO KINDA CONCEIVE OF THESE THINGS AND AND TRY TO ROLL THEM OUT. BUT I AM REMINDED THAT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED TO RELEASE ENERGY. IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ON THESE PROBLEMS. AND THAT MEANS YOU HAVE. TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT ENERGY IS. AND I I'LL GIVE A SHOUT OUT -- IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO I WORKED ON A BILL AUTHORED BY LOU PAP BUT WHICH WAS THE FIRST BILL DEAL WITH CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION. WHICH CONCEIVE OF PUTTING. A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO SUPPORT OF LOCAL CONVERSATION. ON WHAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE AT THAT LOCAL LEVEL TO DO A CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION. SO IS NOT A CASE OF SURPLUS AND THIS IS HOW YOU'LL DO IT. IT WAS A CASE OF SACRAMENTO PUTTING RESOURCES INTO SUPPORT A CONVERSATION ABOUT WE THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE. WHAT MAKES SENSE TO LOCALLY ON HOW TO TACKLE THAT? IT'S SORT OF WITHIN AS WE AS WE WORK ON THIS SYSTEM OF REFORMS. AND TRYING TO SUPPORT. THE TRANSFER ACROSS COUNTY BOUNDARIES WHERE THAT'S GOING TO HELP A CHILD. HOW DO WE GET ACROSS AT COUNTY LINE AND HAVE THE MOST HOSPITABLE IMPLEMENTATION? AND I DO APPRECIATE CAM YOUR EMPHASIS UPON THE FINANCIAL SIDE. WHICH IS OURS TO KIND OF OWN AND THINK ABOUT IN COURT DATE WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE COUNTY. BOARD OF SOUPS AND OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES. BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT. WE NEED TO TAP INTO WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. HOW THEY UNDERSTAND IT FIND THOSE FOLKS WHOSE HEART IS IN IT? AND TRY TO WORK WITH AND UNDERSTAND. WHEN THEY HEAR THE IDEA WHAT OF THE OPTIONS ARE PRESENT THEMSELVES? ARM. IN A WHAT WOULD WORK THE LOCAL OF AND FOR HOW WE CAN -- TWELVE THAT SO ANY COMMENTS COMMENTS PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THE EXTENT WE'VE DONE. THESE LOCAL CONVERSATIONS. WOULD BE HELPFUL. OTHERWISE YOU JUST MORE OBSERVATION I THINK. YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE A LOT. BUT AS EXPRESSIONS WHEN YOU'RE AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I HEAR MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE MONTEREY BAY SAY. WE WE REALLY NEED THEIR LAND THE AIRPLANE. THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS. I DO WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR YOUR COMMENTS FOR YOUR ANSWERS AND I WOULD LIKE TO CALL THE NEXT PANELING ALSO VIEW WILL BE RETURNING. TO GIVE US SOME IDEAS ON HOW WE SOLVE THIS. SO THE NEXT PANEL AS ARE COMING UP. ON PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER WE HAVE CAROL SCHROEDER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR EMERITUS. CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES. SIMONA CATALDO BUT DOCTOR SIMONA CATALDO. CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER VICTOR TREATMENT CENTERS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER VICTOR COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES KATHY SANDERLING. DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. DIANA WAGNER BRANCH DIRECTOR OF SHASTA COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES. I WOULD REQUEST THAT WE LIMIT OUR COMMENTS TO FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES AND LET'S BEGIN WITH THE CAROL SCHROEDER. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M CAROL SCHROEDER I AM WITH THE EGGS CALIFORNIA LIES CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES WE REPRESENT -- HUNDRED THIRTY CREDIT PRIVATE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING CARE SUPPORT AND SERVICES TO OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN FAMILIES ANNUALLY -- AMONG THE SERVICES PROVIDED AT MENTAL HEALTH AND FOSTER CARE -- I WANTED TO START TO IT JUST FOR A MINUTE AND AND AND TAKE A SECOND -- TO TO DEFINE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER IN THE CONTEXT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AND REALLY WHAT PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER AS THAT FOR ANY CHILD HIS PLACED OUTSIDE THEIR COUNTY REGIONAL JURISDICTION THAT IS. THEY'RE PLACED IN A COUNTY OTHER THAN COUNTY WHERE THERE IS THE THERE THE THEIR DEPENDENTS ARE RATHER WORK TO THE COURT -- WHEN THAT OCCURS STAND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING SIT SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES MOVES IS PRESUMPTIVELY TRANSFERRED IN HAVE TO APPLY? YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK YOU NOT THAT YOU KNOW IT PRESUMPTIVELY TRANSFERS FROM THE COUNTY OF ORIGINAL JET FROM MENTAL HEALTH PLAN THE COUNTY ORIGINAL JURISDICTION. TO THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN OF THE COUNTY WHICH THE CHILD'S LIVING THAT'S THE DEAL -- THERE ARE IT WILL END AB TWELVE ANY ANSWER YES WILL BE IN AB -- TWELVE NINETY NINE WITH WHICH WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR WITH THAT STEINBERG INSTITUTED THE WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE. WE ALSO MADE PROVISION FOR WAIVERS WHEN CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS OCCUR. AND THOSE EXCEPTIONS REALLY RELATE TO THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD CONTINUITY OF CARE AND SO ON WHEN THOSE THINGS OCCURRED THEN -- AND THEN A WAIVER OF PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER CAN BE REQUESTED BY THE COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER -- AND THAT CAN BE -- IN THAT CAN BE APPROVED BY THE THE JUVENILE COURT -- I THINK IT AND LISTENING -- TO TO MINSITER INCEST MONNING SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU HEARD FROM THE OTHER STATE FOLKS REALIZE HOW COMPLICATED SYSTEM COULD BE AND HOW QUICKLY GETS COMPLICATED -- THEY THE QUESTION THAT YOU ASK IS IS SORT OF THE TITLE FOR THE HEARING A HEALTH PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER IMPACTED THE PROVISION MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FOSTER YES. I THINK WE CAN ANSWER NOT AS MUCH AS WE HAD HOPED -- BUT HOPEFULLY WE'RE GETTING THERE AND I THINK THAT -- MISTER COOLIES POINT ABOUT THE AND THAT YOU KNOW 90% DONE HALF WAY THERE'S A GOOD -- ONE THE STORY OF AB TWELVE NINETY NINE IS IT WHICH CREATED PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER IS REALLY A STORY ABOUT HOW LIKE HOW CALIFORNIA STRUGGLED. AT LEAST SINCE -- NINETEEN NINETY FIVE TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN PLACED IN FOSTER CARE OUTSIDE THEIR COUNTIES WERE JURISDICTION HAVE ACCESS TO THE MENTAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL FUNDED SPECIALLY MENTAL SERVICES. THAT THEY BOTH NEED TO WHICH THEY'RE ENTITLED -- UNDER FEDERAL LAW -- THE ISSUE THAT WE REALIZED AT SOME POINT DURING ALL THIS AND I'LL GET TO THAT. IS THAT IS MEDI CAL SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA -- OR PROVIDED USING A SYSTEM OF COUNTY BASED MANAGED CARE PLANS WHICH WE CALL MENTAL HEALTH PLANS -- UNDER CONTRACT DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND UNTIL A. B. -- TWELVE NINETY NINE THE WAY THAT THAT WORKS WAS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE A CHILD IN FOSTER CARE WAS PLACED. RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE SERVICES REMAIN TO JURISDICTION. SO CHILD AND ALAMEDA COUNTY -- IS PLACE WITH HER GRANDMOTHER IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY BUT THE BROUGH THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES REMAINS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WITH ALL THE ATTENDANT PROBLEMS YOU COULD SEE CONCEIVABLY COULD ACCRUE TO THAT THAT KIND OF SITUATION -- IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND THEN CENTER STEINBERG -- COASTAL AND END OF AB ATWATER BUILD THE SB SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE WHICH IS CO SPONSORED BY US. THEY'LL HELP NOW THE OLD MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION L. BEHAVIOR ALL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND CWD A WHICH CODIFIED A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS -- THEY CAME OUT OF A WORK GROUP THAT HAD BEEN -- BROUGHT TOGETHER BY THE SELLER BACK -- FAMILY FOUNDATION -- AND IN THE THAT CODIFICATION SAID IT WAS THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE A STATUTORILY. AND SO WHAT IS AB BASICALLY OFFER TO SOLUTIONS AT OR TWO PARTS OF ONE SOLUTION THE FIRST PART WAS IT SAID. FOR ANY CHILD WHO HAS BEEN ADOPTED OUT OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM OR IS LIVING A CAN GUARDIANSHIP SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE LIVING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS -- IT A WHO ARE THERE GUARDIANS AND IF THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION THAN THOSE YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF BY THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN OF THE COUNTY WHERE THAT BUT FOR EVERYBODY ELSE WE'RE GONNA KEEP IT. THE WAY IT AS BUT WHAT SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE DAY WAS A CREATED -- BASICALLY SOME IT IS SOME GREASE TO LUBRICATE THE THE THE GEARS IN THE WHEELS TO KIND OF MAKE ALL THAT STUFF HAPPENED THAT THAT KIM WAS TALKING ABOUT -- EXPERIENCES BENT THAT WHILE IT DID LUBRICATED SOMEWHAT THERE CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM AND IN FACT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE CALIFORNIA WELFARE COUNCIL PUBLISHED REPORT. COMPILED BY ITS OUT OF COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WORKER OF CHINA CHILDREN PLACED IN FOSTER CARE OUTSIDE THEIR COUNTIES ROOT ROOT OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION. WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER IN THOSE PLACED IN COUNTY. BUT WERE 10215% MORE LIGHT LESS LIKELY TO GET ANY SERVICE AT ALL. AND OF THOSE THAT DID RECEIVE SERVICES THAT YOU CAN GET TO A PLACE THAT A COUNTY A RECEIVE FEWER SERVICES ELECTED LESS INTENSE OF SERVICES. THAN THOSE WHO ARE PLACED IN COUNTY. WE THEN -- COSPONSORED AS I SAID ALONG WITH -- THE STEINBERG INSTEAD WOMEN'S -- POLICY -- INSTITUTE -- A. B. -- TWELVE NINE NINE THAT MR RIDLEY THOMAS CARRIED ACTED -- THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICE CONVENE A SERIES OF MEETINGS A STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK OUT THE PARTICULARS HELPERS UP DID PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER IS GOING TO WORK. WE CONTINUE TO SEE PROBLEMS THAT THAT EXIST IN THIS BY AND THE THE STATE REALLY BOIL DOWN TO TWO THINGS ONE AS YOU WOULD EXPECT -- WITH FIFTY I'D COUNTIES -- IT IN THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL MENTAL HEALTH PLANS IS INCONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION BETWEEN THE COUNTIES. AND ONLY TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO THANK DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES IN BEAVER HAVERHILL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE IN ADDRESSING ON A ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY CHILD BY CHILD PROVIDED BY PROVIDER BASIS THOSE GLITCHES THAT COME UP -- SO I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE HERE WITH YOU THINK YOU KNOW MY IDEA AND NOTHING'S HAPPENING AT FOLKS ARE WORKING ON THIS. BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE THAT WE HAVE SEEN -- IS THAT THAT REALLY HAS IMPACTED THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT RELATES TO COUNTIES WHERE THERE ARE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS. AT WHICH ARE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO HAVE A CONTRACT TO PROVIDE SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THESE YEARS. AND WHEN YOU HAVE CERTAIN COUNTIES THAT ARE HIGHLY IMPACTED BY THE PRESENCE OF THESE THEN THEY ARE FACED WITH AND AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY THEN HAVE TO PUT UP FRONT. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT THEIR STATUTORY THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO AT TO MAKE SURE HAPPENS. SO -- WE'RE TO CRISIS POINT NOW FOR THAT I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT IMMEDIATELY MY HOPE IN THIS HEARING IS THAT IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE FURTHER EVIDENCE FOR THE SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES. BECAUSE I RECKON THE TWENTY FOUR YEARS ABOUT LONG ENOUGH TO GET THIS PROBLEM SOLVED. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER SCHROEDER OF SIMONA COULD TELL THE DOCTOR COULD TELL THEM. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MY NAME IS THE ONE I COULD TELL THOUGH I AM. C. L. FOUR VICTOR THREE NINE CENTERS AND THE SEE ALL FOUR VICTOR COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES AND JUST TO CLARIFY THAT THE JURY IS OUT MULTI COUNTY ORGANIZATION COMPRISED OF TWO AGENCIES UNDER ONE ADMINISTRATIVE UMBRELLA AND STILL. TOTAL WITH. THAT -- TODAY I'M HERE TO OFFER TESTIMONY FROM A PROVIDER STANDPOINT -- VESTI OUR TV SERVICES AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THAT AND PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER AND WHILE WE'VE. EXPERIENCED AS THE SENSATION AS OF COURAGE. SO PRIOR -- TO A. B. TWELVE NINETEEN NINE A WE HAD -- TO THIRTEEN EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT CONTRACTS WITH IN OUR GROUP HOMES -- WE HAVE THREE LOCATIONS -- WHINING RIDING WHINING SANTA ROSA AND ONE ENOUGH PASADENA WE'VE THE EXCEPTION OF THE LOCATION IN PASADENA WHICH ONLY SERVES -- KIDS ALL THE LA COUNTY THE OTHER TWO LOCATIONS TO SERVE KIDS OF FROM ANY COMPANY -- PRIOR TO A. B. TWELVE NINETY NINE ANY COUNTY WE HAD A CONTRACT WITH. WELL WE'VE SEEN WITH TWELVE NINETY NINE NEEDS A COUPLE OF THINGS -- FIRST OF ALL THE MAJORITY OF COUNTIES HAVE CHOSEN TO MAINTAIN A CONTRACT WITH US -- ONLY A HANDFUL LAWS COMPANIES HAVE THAT -- NOT RENEW WITH THAT THEIR CONTRACTS -- DUE TO THE FACT THAT THAT -- THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO USE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER WHENEVER THEY ARE IN NEED OF PLACING A TIED THE KNOT S. C. R. T. P. PROGRAM. THERE IS ALSO AVAILABILITY BETWEEN THE TWO SITES WHERE ONE SITE A WE SEE THE MAJORITY OF KIDS BEING -- PRESUMPTIVELY TRANCE THIRD WHEREAS THE OTHER SIDE HE'S EXPERIENCING ONLY A HANDFUL OF KIDS ARE BEING PRESUMPTIVELY TRANSFERRED WITH THE COUNTIES THAT NORMALLY EVERY FURTHER INTO THAT HE'S PROMPTING -- THAT CHOICE THAT MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT -- SOME OF THOSE COUNTIES THAT CHOOSE TO WAIVE OUR LARGER COUNTIES. WHICH PROBABLY HAVE -- MORE SERVICES TO PROVIDE -- ONCE A THE THE CHINESE RETURNED -- BACKING COUNTY. SO -- WH WHAT WE ARE SEEING WHAT WE WERE HOPEFUL THAT WE'VE -- PRESUMPTIVE TRANSPORTING PLACE A WEEK COULD ACTUALLY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS WE'VE COUNTIES BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE EACH CONTRACT COMES WITH DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS TO SO WE WERE REALLY. THINKING THAT A PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER WAS GOING TO STREAMLINE -- THESE PROCESSES WHILE WE'VE EXPERIENCED ACTUALLY IS THE OPPOSITE THAT -- WE ARE SEEING MORE COMPLICATION MORE DOCUMENTATION AND THAT WE ARE IN NOW -- NOT ALWAYS COMFORTABLE PLACE SELF TRYING TO MEDIATE BETWEEN PLACING COUNTY AND RECEIVING COUNTY -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PAPERWORK IS IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN -- RECEIVE THE CHILD AND STUFF OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF A C. R. T. P. AND ONE OF THE PURPOSES FOR REST THE RTP. IS OF COURSE THESE KIDS COME IN WITH VERY HIGH INTENSITY NEEDS AND A VERY SHORT STAY AND WE WANT TO WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING THAT -- STAY AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE REALLY TRULY BELIEVE THAT KIDS NEED TO BE SERVED IN THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY ARE -- CONGREGATE THEY CARE IS GOOD FOR SOME THINGS BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE NORMALIZED PLACEMENT EXPERIENCE THAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO HAVE. SO WE SEE OURSELVES AS KIND OF LIKE THE EQUIVALENT OF A NICE YOU RIGHT YOU GO TO THE I SEE YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE IN AN ACUTE STATE. THAT -- STAY IN THE I SEE YOU ALLOWS YOU TO NOT BE AS A CUE TO WHICH DOESN'T MEAN YOUR FIXED BY YOU ARE WELL ENOUGH TO BE THREE DEAD. AT AT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE. STILL OUR HOPIS THE READ THAT DAVIES STREAMLINING OFF THIS PROCESS IS SO THAT -- AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE ON A POSITION ODDS AND MEETING THE CHILD AS SOON AS WE GET READY FOR ALL AND THAT WE CAN START PROVIDING SERVICES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WAS THE RIGHT NOW WHILE WE ARE SEEING IS -- ED ENOCH QUEST THE FOR PAPER WORK WHERE ACTUALLY DELAYING THAT -- INTAKE. AND ALSO WE ARE SEEING DENIALS THAT BEFORE WE DID AND YOU. AS A COMMUNITY THAT WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH AND AND THEY HAVE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER SO DISEASE. THIS IS COMPLICATING THAT -- THAT PROCESS A LITTLE BIT OF FUNDING IS ALSO A NEED TO AS MANY HAVE ATTESTED -- TO BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE OF OUR SITES -- WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING IS THAT -- LAST MONTH ALONE TWENTY TWO OUT OF THIRTY KIDS WHERE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFERS -- AS OPPOSED TO THE NORM ALL FOUR TO FIVE TO SIX KIDS TOP OF THAT -- THAT THAT COUNTY WAS PREVIOUSLY RESPONSIBLE FOR FROM PAYMENT STANDPOINT AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE A CONTRACT A CONTRACT ALSO ESTABLISHES THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE. AND THEREFORE WHEN -- OF COURSE WITH THE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF OF KIDS BEING PLACE THAT ARE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFERS -- WE ARE IN A POSITION OF NEEDING TO REQUIRE ANY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE SOMETIMES OF THE FUNDING NECESSARY FOR US TO CONTINUE. TO OPERATE UNDER THAT CONTRACT. THANK YOU FOR THE OUT OF HOME KATHY SANDERLING PLACE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KATHY SAID KNOWING WHAT THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ROLE THAT SEE WTA PLAYED IN TWELVE NINETY NINE AND GIVE SOME THOUGHTS ON PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER. AND TALK ABOUT A COUPLE THEMES THAT WE'RE SEEING AND HEARING ABOUT FROM COUNTIES I KNOW IT'S SORT OF THE LAST RABBIT PANEL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE SOME SUGGESTIONS AS WELL SO I WANT. TO TRY TO I'LL TRY NOT TO GET TOO MUCH INTO THAT -- AT THE MOMENT. SO AS FAR AS FOUR YEARS AGO -- AS NOTED IN THE MATERIALS IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER IT WAS CLEAR WE WERE ENGAGED FOR MANY YEARS AND THIS LONG STANDING ISSUE IT WAS FRUSTRATING. TO NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUR YOUTH AND CHILDREN THAT WE PLACE OUT OF COUNTY -- FOR THE REASONS THAT MISTER ROSE NOTED IN HIS TESTIMONY -- THOSE SERVICES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND FOR THERE TO BE CONFUSION ABOUT WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AND NOT A LOT OF CONSISTENCY THERE. SO WE WORKED WITH THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN WITH THE TWO SPONSORS TO HELP IN DRAFTING THE FINAL BILL WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT. AND WE DID SUPPORT THE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER AS WELL. WE SUPPORTED IT BECAUSE WE REALLY NEEDED THAT CLARIFICATION BUT WE ALSO FELT THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT ABILITY TO WAIVE THAT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND MR CHARTER EXPLAINED A LITTLE BIT OF THIS BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT OUR THE STABILITY OF THE THERAPEUTIC. RELATIONSHIP THAT THAT YOU THIS ALREADY FORMED IF THEY'RE RECEIVING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THEIR EXISTING COUNTY -- AND IF YOU COULD MAINTAIN THOSE AND IT WAS ABOUT THE BAY AREA OR IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT LONG ACROSS COUNTY LINES [inaudible] HAS OR OF OTHER SORT OF NONTRADITIONAL SERVICES AS MS HERNANDEZ NOTED ON THE FIRST PANEL SUCH AS ART THERAPY ONCE YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GREAT RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER YOU SHOULD -- POTENTIALLY SEVER THAT EVEN FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WHILE THE YOUTH IS IN THAT -- I S. T. R. T. P. OR PLACED WITH A RELATIVE OUT OF COUNTY -- SO THE ABILITY ALSO FOR THE HOST COUNTY -- OR FOR THE PLACING COUNTY TO BE ABLE TO DO A CONTRACT WITH THE PROVIDER WHO'S IN THE COUNTY THAT AT THE YOUTH IS LIVING IN WAS ALSO A CONSIDERATION AS WELL IF THEY ALREADY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP AND THEY CAN JUST EXPAND THAT CONTRACT. THATMAKES A LOT OF SENSE IF IT'S BRAND NEW THERE'S NO CONTRACT THERE'S NO EXISTING RELATIONSHIP. PERHAPS BETTER THAN TO ALLOW THAT PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER TO OCCUR AND HAVE THAT CONTRACT IS PICKED UP BY THE COUNTY -- OF PLACEMENT. WE ALSO FELT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER THE PLACING AGENCY TO BE MAKING ALTERNATELY THAT DETERMINATION WITH INPUT FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WITH INPUT FROM THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM. BUT ULTIMATELY WERE THE ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARE CUSTODY AND CONTROL OF THAT YOUTH AND WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SORT OF VAST THAT DECISION ULTIMATELY WITH THAT COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER. ON AND FINALLY I DO WANT TO SAY AND REMIND US THAT THE WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE S. T. R. T. P.. AND GROUP HOME RELATED ISSUES THIS APPLIES TO ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND MUCH OF OUR CONVERSATION IN THE ORIGINAL ORIGINAL LEGISLATION THOUGHT ABOUT THOSE PLACES WITH RELATIVE CARE GIVERS WHO MIGHT LIVE ACROSS COUNTY LINES. WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM AND HOW CAN WE MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO RECEIVE SERVICES SO THAT ISSUES I THINK ARE MORE ACUTE AND WE'RE TALKING MORE ABOUT THEM WITH THE? CONGREGATE FACILITIES BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR OUR RELATIVE CAREGIVERS ANOTHER FOSTER PARENTS RESOURCE FAMILIES WITHIN THESE CHILDREN ARE PLACED. SO SOME OF THE THEMES THAT WERE HEARING I THINK KIND OF CLOSER TO TWO AREAS ONE IS COMPLEXITY AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT DIFFERENT CONTRACTS ACROSS DIFFERENT COUNTY LINES WHEN WE'RE PLACING FROM ONE COUNTY TO ANOTHER. JUST EVEN THE FORMS ARE DIFFERENT CONSENT FOR THEY DIFFER BY COUNTIES THERE THERE'S FIFTY PLUS OF THOSE AS WELL -- THE CONTRACTING DIFFERS BY COUNTY WHAT THE CONTRACT LOOKS LIKE WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO PAY FOR AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. AND THEN ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBER BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE OF FORMER RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT TRANSITION FROM THE OLD GROUP HOME FACILITIES INTO THESE S. T. R. T. PEAS. AND SO WITH A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY ALL HAVE THAT MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACT ON THERE JUST NOT A PLACE YET AND THAT CAN LEAD TO A LACK OF TIMELINESS OF SERVICES. MISTER COOLEY. YES MISTER COOLING JUST A VERY BRIEF QUESTION ON THIS SO AS YOUR COMMENT UPON THE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES I MEAN THAT KIND OF IMPLIES. IF YOU COULD STANDARDIZE THINGS THAT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS I THINK THERE COULD BE SOME STANDARDIZATION ACROSS THE THINGS I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK AT THE STATE BOTH DEPARTMENTS TO TRY TO HELP WITH THIS -- THERE IS A A CLEARING HOUSE WHERE ALL OF THOSE RELEASE OF INFORMATION CONSENT FORMS ARE BEING POSTED ON THE INTERNET SO IF THE COUNTY IS PLACING OUT OF COUNTY THEY CAN GO AND PULL DOWN THAT TOOK LEASES AVAILABLE. THE CONTRACTING I THINK IT'S TRICKY BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE FIFTY PLUS COUNTY COUNCILS YOU HAVE THE WE'VE DONE IT THIS WAY THESE CONTRACTS WORK THERE IN PLACE. CERTAINLY I THINK MORE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE CONTRACTS AND WE'D LOVE TO WORK WITH FOLKS TO SEE IF THERE ARE SOME COMMON ELEMENTS THAT COULD BE STANDARDIZED AND THEN MAYBE THE COUNTY. KIND OF ADS IN A FEW THINGS THAT MIGHT BE COUNTY SPECIFIC IT REGARDING -- LOCATIONS OF TREATMENTS ARE PROVIDERS THAT MAKES THE STOMACH COUNTY VERSUS ANOTHER AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT IT WOULD I THINK BE GREAT AND USEFUL IF THERE WASN'T ABILITY. TO TRY TO MAKE SOME STANDARDIZATION AND CERTAINLY TRANSPARENCY ACROSS THAT THAT'S COUNTIES IT'S IT'S A GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU CAN. RECOMMEND. THANK YOU I'M I THINK AS FAR AS THE CAPACITY IN THE SORT OF FALLS RIGHT IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- YOU HAVE CAPACITY OF JUST THE AVAILABILITY OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROVIDERS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE ACROSS BOTH ADULT AND CHILDREN'S SERVICES WITH PROVIDERS WHO HAVE THE RIGHT TRAINING TRAUMA INFORMED CARE -- ALTERNATIVE TYPES OF BIG OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT AGAIN AS THIS HERNANDEZ NOTED -- AS WELL AS THIS AND THAT PENETRATION RATES THAT WERE STILL I THINK WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS ON BEHAVIOR HOW TO TRY TO INCREASE INCREASE TIMELINESS INCREASE THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THE YOUTH. IN ALSO -- INSURE THAT THE DATA ARE REALLY THERE SO WE CAN TRACK THAT OVER TIME -- SO SO IT'S SORT OF A CAPACITY ISSUE THERE CAPACITY REGARDING THE S. HERE TO BE IS NOT HAVING THOSE CONTRACTS IN PLACE AGAIN RAN TRANSITION. AND THEN I THINK FINALLY JUST SORT OF A CAPACITY OF PROVIDERS AND THAT INCLUDES AS CHAIR TEEPEES. THERE'S SOME THERE'S MANY THEY'RE NOT MAKING THE TRANSITION FOR SOME REASON WHATEVER REASON THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS THAT ARE VERY LEGITIMATE THEY DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT. SO THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW RECEIVE OUR CHILDREN ANYMORE AS PLACEMENTS THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE WORKING WITHOUT WORKING WITH THE STATE TO TRY TO DO THAT. BUT WE KNOW THE STATE DOESN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GONNA MAKE IT THEY'RE SORT OF ON A LIST OF I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PUT A PROGRAM TOGETHER THAT WE CAN BLAST. SO WE'RE GONNA LOSE SOME CAPACITY THERE. THE THING IS CC ARE THE WHOLE POINT IS TO GET THE YOUTH OUT OF THESE FACILITIES TO HAVE THESE BE SHORT TERM VERY THERAPEUTIC AND I MEAN JUST AS DOCTOR CATALDO WAS TALKING ABOUT -- YOU'RE NOT FIX NECESSARILY BUT YOU'RE TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN HELP PLACE YOU IN THE COMMUNITY WHAT WOULD REALLY RATHER DO AND WHAT I THINK SEIZE HERE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON AS THE COUNTY'S ABILITY TO REALLY RECRUIT AND SUPPORT FAMILIES. AND SUPPORT THEM WHERE THEY ARE RAP SERVICES ARE THOSE BEDS IN THOSE THE THAT ARE MORE CALL SURE IS OKAY WE OKAY WITH THAT THE SERVICES HAVE GOT TO BE THERE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND WE'RE JUST WE'RE NOT THERE YET -- I THINK MR ROSE'S POINT ABOUT THE CHILD SPECIFIC RECRUITMENT WE ARE DOING A GREAT JOB WE THINK OF FINDING RELATIVES OR OTHER ON SORT OF NON RELATED BUT EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS WHO CAN TAKE IN THE CHILDREN. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THEN IF THAT CHILD IS REUNIFIED OR SAY THEY TAKE GUARDIANSHIP OR ADOPTION THEY DON'T TEND TO TAKE ANOTHER KID THEY'RE GOD THEY'RE NOT A FOSTER HOME IN THE SENSE OF THE TRADITIONAL. LICENSE TONE THAT MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY OVER TIME OKAY WE'VE WORKED WITH THAT YOU'D NOW WILL TAKE ANOTHER. ONE AND SO -- I THINK THERE WAS SOME THINKING THAT PERHAPS THE SORT OF ODD STABILITY FUND THE FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT FUNDING WOULD BE ONE TIME AND THEN WE KIND OF GET ENOUGH OF AND WE CAN BE DONE WITH THAT -- WERE DEFINING THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE HAVE A BUDGET REQUESTS AND RELATED TO THAT AS WELL AS RELATED TO SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO YOU. PRESERVE FAMILIES STABILIZE FAMILIES IN THE VEIN OF WHAT MS HERNANDEZ WAS TALKING ABOUT HER MEMBERS CARE ABOUT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE THERE WITH THEM. SO I'LL WRAP UP THERE AND I'M SORT OF SAVE THE SUGGESTIONS BUT ON BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I ANA WAGNER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DIANA WAGNER SHASTA COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY FRENCH DIRECTOR OVER BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE -- I'VE WORKED WITH THE COUNTY FOR FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO THAT I WORKED AT A LOCAL LOCAL LEVEL THIRTEEN FOURTEEN GROUP HOME FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND HAVING THEM NUMBER OF YEARS EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH FOSTER YOUTH. AND PROBATION IS -- TO AB TWELVE NINETY NINE THERE WERE SOME COUNTIES IN THE STATE THAT DID NOT PROVIDE SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR FOSTER YOUTH WHO ARE PLACED OUTSIDE OF THEIR COUNTY OF LOCAL JURISDICTION. THIS WAS A PROBLEM THAT WE RAN INTO AND SHASTA COUNTY WHEN PLACING YOUTH INTO OTHER COUNTIES WITH RELATIVES OR WITHIN THEIR FOR FOREVER FAMILY. I BELIEVE THIS JOB AT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE FOR YOUTH PLACED OUTSIDE THE COUNTY OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION INTO FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES. COUNTY FOSTER HOMES. INTO RELATIVE HOMES AND EVEN INTO NON RELATED EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS WHAT I DO NOT BELIEVE THE BILL TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION WAS A BEFORE -- THREE THE CONTINUE OF KERRY FORM AND THE REFORM OF GROUP HOMES INTO. S. T. R. T. PEAS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON SITE TO ADDRESS THE ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF FOSTER YOUTH PLACED IN CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS. FOR SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. MOST FOSTER YOUTH PLACED UNDER CONGREGATE CARE HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE FOSTER CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. NEXT TO THE USE THEMSELVES THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN IN THE COUNTY OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION HAS THE GREATEST KNOWLEDGE OF THE FOSTER USE MENTAL HEALTH HISTORY. AND SERVICE NEEDS. THIS LANDS TO THE CONTINUITY OF CARE OF FOSTER YOUTH BEING BEST SERVED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN OF THE COUNTY OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION. IN MY ROLE AS THE CHILD WELFARE DIRECTOR. I CONTINUE TO SEE NOTICES GIVEN ON YOUTH PLACE TO CONGREGATE CARE AND BY WAVING PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER ON THESE USE. THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN OF ORIGINAL JUST JURISDICTION ARE ABLE TO PLAY A ROLE IN ENSURING THESE USE NEEDS CONTINUE TO BE MET REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE YOUTH THIS PLACE. IT IS DUE TO THIS REASON THAT A NUMBER OF COUNTIES WAVE PROVIDE SOME TO TRANSFER. AMONG USE PLACE TO CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS IN ORDER TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO MONITOR THE TREATMENT PROVIDED TO THEIR YOUTH PROVIDE INTENSIVE CARE COORDINATION. AND CONTRACT FOR SERVICES TO ENSURE THAT THEIR FOSTER YOUTH ARE BEST INTEREST -- FOR FIELD HOWEVER THERE'S ALWAYS AN EXCEPTION TO THAT STATEMENT. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS A YOUNG MAN HE WAS PLACED IN FRESNO COUNTY IN A GROUP HOME. HE WAS PLACED THERE BECAUSE HIS FATHER Là THIS WAS PRIOR TO PRESENT TO TRANSFER BEING IN PLACE. UNFORTUNATELY HE BLEW OUT OF THAT PLACEMENT. ON BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT. ADEQUATELY EQUIPPED TO MEET HIS NEEDS OF THE ALCOHOL AND DRUG -- USE THAT HE HAD SO HE WAS PLACED INTO THE BAY AREA. BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN CARE AND CUSTODY AND ALSO OVERSIGHT A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE WERE EASILY ABLE TO FIND HIM AN APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT. AND THE BAY AREA AND STILL THE PLAN IS TO MOVE HIM BACK TO FRESNO TO BE NEAR HIS FATHER. AT WHICH TIME PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER WOULD BE PUT IN PLACE. SHASTA COUNTY IS A RECEIVING COUNTY OF FSTER YOUTH MEANING THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER A GREATER NUMBER OF FOSTER YOUTH PLACED IN SHASTA COUNTY BY OTHER COUNTIES. THAN SHASTA COUNTY SENDS OUT OF COUNTY. AT THIS TIME THERE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE AUSTRIA'S PLACED IN SHASTA COUNTY BY OTHER COUNTIES WITH FOR CONGREGATE CARE PROVIDERS OF HIGH NEEDS FOSTER YOUTH. CURRENTLY THERE ARE TODAY EIGHTEEN PRESUMPTIVELY TRANSFERRED FOSTER YOU THINK CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS AND NUMEROUS OTHERS PLACED IN FAMILY HOME SETTINGS. AS PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ALL YOU. WHETHER THEY ARE PRESUMPTIVELY TRANSFERRED OR THERE THE JURISDICTION OF SHASTA COUNTY. WE CONDUCT SCREENS COMPLETE. CHILD ADOLESCENTS NEEDS AND STRENGTHS. COMPLETE AND REVIEW ASSESSMENTS REGULARLY COMPLETE TREATMENT PLANS ATTEND CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM MEETINGS TO ENSURE THE COORDINATION OF SERVICES PROVIDE SERVICES. AND OR AUTHORIZE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED BY CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS OR BY OUR CONGRESS -- BY OUR CONTRACTED PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER AND TAKING RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE YOUTH AND SHASTA COUNTY IS MORE THAN JUST ABOUT A PAYMENT. IN JULY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHEN AB TWELVE NINETY NINE FIRST BEGAN. THERE WERE NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAD WITH CHILD WELFARE DIRECTOR DIRECTORS DISCUSSING AB. TWELVE NINETY NINE THE MEANING BEHIND THE BILL. THIS ALSO OCCURRED MORE OFTEN WHEN COUNTIES PLACE FOSTER YOUTH IN THE GROUP HOMES OR THE CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS LOCATED IN CHEST COUNTY. THERE WAS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING TO THE LAW. AND OF THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS THE IN ORDER FOR THOSE YOUTH TO RECEIVE THE SERVICES. EVEN AS I SPEAK TODAY THERE CONTINUES TO BE ISSUE WITH THE PLACING AGENCIES PROMPTLY PROVIDING IMAGE PEAS WITH THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS FOR CLIENTS TO BE OPENED TO SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AC SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS OF THE TERMINATION OF PRISM TO TRANSFER THE PLACE AN AGENCY IS TO CONTACT THE MENTAL HEALTH. PLANS POINT OF CONTACT. FOR THE FOSTER THE FOUR ON THE FOSTER USE BEING PLACED OUT OF THEIR COUNTY OF ORIGINAL DIVERT JURISDICTION AND PROVIDE CONTRACT CONTACT INFORMATION ON THE YOUTH. ON THE PLACEMENT THE CHILD IS GOING. TO CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE SOCIAL WORKER OR PROBATION OFFICER. A SIGNED CONSENT FOR SERVICES. X. SIGNED CONSENT FOR MEDICATION THAT INCLUDE THE JV. TO TWENTY AND THE MOST RECENT MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT. AND WHILE THESE FORMS ARE READILY AVAILABLE. TO COUNTY WORKERS ONLINE. THIS STILL CONTINUES TO BE AN AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT. WHAT PERCENT OF TRANSFER? HAS IMPACTED MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE DUE TO LACK OF WORK FORCE DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING RECEIVING THAT RECEIVING COUNTY IS FOR PURPOSE PROVIDING SERVICES. THERE NEEDS TO BE A REVISION. IT IS THE LAW THAT TRULY BENEFITS YOUTH PLACED WITH RELATIVES WITH AN F. A PHASE WITHIN COUNTY HOMES AND WITH NON EXTENDED. NON RELATED EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS. BUT IT IS A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER CARROLL. NUMBER STIR SCHROEDER. ANSWERS ALMOST ANYTHING. THE USER PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO OUT OF COUNTY FOSTER YOUTH HAS BEEN A FOCUS. FOR SOMETIME IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S NEW. IN YOUR OPINION WHAT IS MADE THIS ISSUE OF PROTECT. IN PARTICULAR SO DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS. WELL I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A COMBINATION OF THINGS -- IF YOU GO BACK FAR ENOUGH -- IT -- AND MISTER COOLEY WAS IT WAS TALKING ABOUT THE THE THE BILL THAT THAT THAT MEANS THAT HE WORKED WITH MR PAT AND AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY THREE WHICH I FORTUNATELY REMEMBER. WHICH WHICH YOU KNOW TELLS YOU HOW LONG I'VE BEEN DOING THIS THERE REALLY WERE NO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN EXCEPT WHAT ANY INDIVIDUAL COUNTY SCRATCH TOGETHER -- IT DIDN'T OCCUR IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD WHERE IT DIDN'T MATTER WHETHER IN A GROUP HOME WHERE FOSTER FAMILY HOME IT JUST DIDN'T MATTER THE THE SERVICES WERE WERE BARELY THERE -- IN -- NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WITH THE ADVENT OF THE OF THE LITIGATION THAT LED TO THE THE THE USE OF THE PST T.. TO PROVIDE THOSE SIR TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES FOR YOU THROUGH THE MEDICARE PROGRAM -- THEN IF IT BECAME RESPONSIBILITY INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES AND AS I SAY A BIG PROBLEM IS IS THAT EACH COUNTY DOES IT'S YOU KNOW HAS ITS OWN. STUFF THAT IT DOES AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT. IS SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWENTY TO FORTY CENTS VERY MEDI CAL DOLLARS THAT'S THAT'S PAY THAT SPENT ON AND YOU USE THAT YOU SPEND FOR THE MIDDLE OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR YOUTH. IS SPENT ON Q. A MEANING MAKING SURE THAT YOU MAKE SURE ALL YOUR TEASER THIS -- THE IS -- TAKEN CARE OF AND THAT'S IT LARGELY INTO A GREAT EXTENT THAT HAS TO DO WITH -- WITH MULTIPLE COUNTY CONTRACTS MULTIPLE DEMANDS ON THAT SORT OF THING SAVE GOT THAT PROBLEM -- THE AND THEN THE THE THE THEN THE THE JUST THAT THE THE COMPLEXITY OF WHEN AS I SAY I COUNTY FROM SAY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PLATES AT THE PLACE IS A JOB WITH THAT -- WITH A EITHER WITH A RELATIVE OR IN A FFA OR WITH A GROUP HOME. IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA -- THE DID THE NCAPACITY IN THE DIFFICULTY AND HAVING THAT THE THE THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN OF THAT CAT THE THE OF THE PLACING COUNTY COORDINATE WITH SERVICES IN THAT RECEIVING COUNTIES IS REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT -- AND SO I I I I UNDERSTAND I IS POINT ABOUT THE THAT IT HAS WORKED OUT WELL FOR FOR YOUTH AND IN THAT -- IN RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS. BUT ACTUALLY IN IN TERMS THE HOW THE MONEY FLOWS WE HAD A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THAT WHEN WE FIRST READ THE BILL -- IN WHICH IT WAS GONNA BE YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS KIND OF TO ENSURE THE COUNTIES THAT RECEIVED AS THOSE YEARS WITH -- WERE COVERED IN THE FIRST YEAR WITHIN A YEAR THAT THEY GOT THE THE OF THAT THOSE COSTS WERE COVERED FOR THEM -- SO IS IT WAS BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL VETO THAT WE HAD TO CHANGE THAT AND WE KNEW THAT THE TIME WE CHANGE IT WAS GONNA BE A PROBLEM AND FRANKLY WE REALLY WANTED -- TO WE WANTED TO PUSH THIS ISSUE WE WANTED TO GET A FINAL RESOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE OF IT UP FOR SO LONG -- I THINK THE THE THE LAST THING IS THAT THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE TAKEN ON YOU KNOW THEIR WHERE THEY WANTED TO OR NOT ANOTHER ISSUE BUT I HAVE TAKEN ON A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM -- WITH THE CAPTAIN OF THE MONEY TO PROVIDE THAT ENTITLEMENT AND AND AND NOW THEIR BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS ARE ARE FACING A REALLY DIFFICULT TASK AND THAT IS. THAT YOU KNOW YOU THE YOUNG PERSON WHO IS ENTITLED TO THE SERVICES IN TITLE THE SERVICES REGARDLESS OF WHERE THAT COUNTY CAN PAY FOR IT. AND THE COUNTIES OF TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYING FOR IT NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES ONE OF WELL HOW DO YOU DO THAT HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE GET THOSE SERVICES. SO I IT IT'S IT'S A COMPLICATED IT COMES. YOU HEALTH AND IF NOT I'LL TALK. NO. THAT WAS THE ANSWER WHAT WE'RE HEARING -- I DO WANT TO THANK YOU I DO WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS -- I WANT TO CALL BACK. REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES OF DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO REJOIN THE OTHER PANELISTS AT THE TABLE TO DISCUSS. POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS AND EFFORTS BEING MADE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD TODAY THANK YOU. VANESSA ONCE YOU HAVE A SEAT WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH YOU. THEN I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE SS AND DH CS TO SPEAK. AND THEN THE REMAINING PANELISTS CAN ALSO ADD ON IF THEY'D LIKE THE OLD. SO POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS AND EFFORTS BEING MADE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD HERE TODAY. YES THANK YOU -- AND THE YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY THINK -- MORE BROADLY IN THE BILL OF THE TECH KIND OF BRAINSTORMING VISION -- A SYSTEM THAT WOULD SERVE THE UNIQUE NEEDS FOR OUR CHILDREN YOUTH IN CARE -- THINKING OUT LOUD AND ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT INTEGRATING SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD FROM MY MEMBERS -- THERE'S SEVERAL IDEAS ARE START WITH I'M ONE OF THEM PROBABLY THE MOST PROCESS WOULD BE TO RADICALLY MOBILIZE RESOURCES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN CARE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN CONGREGATE CARE. AND AT THE IDEA ONE OF THE CORE -- TENANTS OF C. C. R. WAS THAT A YOUNG PERSON WOULD GET SERVICES NO MATTER WHERE THEY WERE PLACE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO FILL UP TO A GROUP HOME OR CONGREGATE CARE SETTING. TO GET THE THERAPEUTIC HELP THAT THEY NEED -- AND THE THE FOLKS ARE ON THE TABLE CAN CORRECT MY NUMBERS BUT THE AMOUNT OF THE MONEY THAT WE'RE SPENDING PER YOUTH PER MONTH IN GROUP HOMES. IS VERY VERY HIGH IF I HAD TO GUESS WOULD BE BETWEEN EIGHT TO TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH IF WE WERE TO USE THOSE RESOURCES TO REALLY SUPPORT THE FAMILY WITH WRAPAROUND SERVICES. WITH THE SERVICES THAT MADE SENSE TO THEM AND REALLY SUPPORTED THEM IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES I BET WE COULD GET A LOT OF THINGS DONE. I'M ANOTHER IDEA OR TO SUPPORT THAT IDEA WOULD BE TO LOOK AT THE ESTHER TEEPEES BY DO HAVE ON SITE THERAPISTS AND CLINICIANS OR ARE CONTRACTED WITH THEM. INSTEAD OF HAVING AN ON SITE PERSON COULD WE MOBILIZE THAT PERSON TO GO VISIT THOSE TWELVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES IS THAT A STRUCTURE THAT MAKES SENSE. FOR CALIFORNIA. ANOTHER THING I'D LIKE TO UPLIFT TODAY IS WRAPAROUND SERVICES A LOT OF THE TRUMP FAMILY TEAM IN DIFFERENT -- MODELS THAT WE HEAR ABOUT AND TALK ABOUT TODAY HAVE STAND OR HAVE ELEMENTS OF WRAP AROUND -- AND THAT THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT HAS HAD. A LOT OF THE EVIDENCE BASED OF PRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES THAT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE TO RE LOOK AT ANOTHER IDEA ANOTHER SOLUTION. WOULD BE TO EXPAND THE NET OF WHAT ELIGIBLE SERVICES ARE SO WE WOULD WIDEN THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD FIND. TO BE MORE RELEVANT AND CONNECTED TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE SERVING -- COULD INCLUDE NONTRADITIONAL OF SUPPORT AND HEALING THIS COULD BE COMMUNITY BASED OR CULTURALLY BASED. PROGRAMS AND SO THE IDEA WOULD BE TO HAVE AN ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT REALLY MEET YOUNG PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE AT IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. SPECIFICALLY I'D ALSO LIKE TO UPLIFT THE EXPANSION OF SERVICES FOR TAE YOUNG PEOPLE. AS THEIR NET NAVIGATING ADULTHOOD. A LOT OF THEM HAVE COME TO A PLACE IN THEIR LIVES WHERE THERE ONE TEEN RESOURCES THEY'RE WANTING TOOLS. AND AT THAT JUNCTURE IN TIME THERE'S NOT A LOT TO OFFER AND SO I'D LIKE TO SUPPORT AND EXPAND -- WIDENING THE NET FOR TEH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS WELL THANK YOU. HOW ABOUT SOMEBODY FROM DSS? GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS SERRA ROGERS AND I AM THE BRANCH CHIEF -- BEFORE THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM OVERSEEING GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION FORCE SIXTY ARM. AND WE ARE THROUGH OUR C. C. R. IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS EXTREMELY AWARE AND FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE COROLLARY CHALLENGES -- THAT HAVE OCCURRED WITH PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER IMPLEMENTATION THAT KIND OF A CREDIT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME. AND WELL C. C. R. HAS A TACKLE THE PROBLEM BY EMBEDDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE MENTAL HEALTH OR IN THE S. T. R. T. P. MODEL THE RESIDENTIAL SETTING. INHERENTLY WE'RE SEEING THREE GENERAL BUCKETS -- WHERE WE WOULD SUGGEST ARE FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS AT THE SOLUTION ONE IS THAT WE SEE THERE'S A LEARNING CURVE AND SO TO THAT END WE HAVE INVESTED VERY HEAVILY ON A? LOT OF REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE ARE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY ACROSS THE STATE. ON LITERALLY A WEEKLY BASIS TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNER AGENCY -- DH CS WE ARE ON THE PHONE WITH COUNTIES BOTH -- AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL BUT ACTUALLY HAVE ALSO THROUGH C. ARE IMPLEMENTED CHILD SPECIFIC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CALLS WHERE WIN -- ANY BARRIER TO THE SERVICES ARE OCCURRING COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY INVITED TO REACH OUT TO US AND IN MANY CASES THE CHALLENGE TO THE CHILD'S PLACEMENT OR STABILITY -- THEIR WELL BEING IS PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER AND IN THOSE INSTANCES WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR ASSOCIATION PARTNERS AS WELL AS TEACH CS TO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS. AND FROM THAT HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS. AND I THINK THE OTHER THE OTHER SOLUTION FOR IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADDRESSING THE LEARNING CURVE IS THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED THROUGH THIS LEARNING PROCESS. AID A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE KIND OF GUIDE THAT WE PLAN TO RELEASE AND MARCH THAT I THINK BRENDA RELATES CAN ALSO SPEAK -- TO WHERE WE ARE WE ARE IMPLEMENTING A VERY CAREFUL STEP BY STEP PROCESS THAT WILL COMMUNICATE CLEARLY NOT ONLY HOW AB WAIVER DECISION. SHOULD BE REACHED BUT ALSO ONCE IT IS REACHED EXACTLY WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER TO AVOID -- THE CONFUSION ESSENTIALLY OVER TIME CAN THING WE I DID ONE AND PUT INTO SIZE IS THAT. WE STILL FEEL THAT EACH CHILD SPECIFIC DETERMINATION IS CRITICAL THAT JUMPING TO ANOTHER ONE SIZE FITS ALL IN THIS SITUATION IS PROBABLY NOT WHAT ANYONE AND I WOULD RECOMMEND -- I'M ASSUMING THAT OTHERS MIGHT AGREE WITH ME ON THAT BUT THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM -- MODEL THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED BOTH PRIOR TO SEE SEE OUR BUT THEN VERY MUCH EMPHASIZED IN CC ARE. WE THINK IS WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD IN NOT ONLY ANSWERING THIS QUESTION ABOUT PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER BUT ALSO ALL OF THE OTHER COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD AROUND. HOW WHAT IS IT THAT WOULD BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS CHILD WHAT OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE? TO STABILIZE THE PLACEMENT TO PRINT TO TO HELP THE FAMILY REALLY CARE FOR THE CHILD BEFORE THEY EVEN GET TO AN S. T. R. T. P.. AND THEN ONCE THEY'RE IN A NEST YEAR T. P. HOW DO WE CORRECTLY PLAN FOR AN IMPLEMENT THEIR THEIR TRANSITION TO A HOME SETTING -- AND SO THAT CHILD SPECIFIC DETERMINATION I THINK IS REALLY CRITICAL AND SO RATHER THAN. AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN CONFUSION AROUND THE PRESUMPTIVE WORD PRESUMPTIVE -- AND SO AS A RESULT FOR S. T. R. T. P. PLACEMENTS IN PARTICULAR WE REALLY NEED TO EMPHASIZE THAT FOR EVERY CHILD THERE HAS TO BE A VERY CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. AND THEN LASTLY WE WOULD EMPHASIZE THE PLANNING AND COLLABORATION AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL AND SO CCAR HAS REQUIRED PURSUANT TO AB. EIGHTEEN ELEVEN VERY RIGOROUS TRANSITION PLANS BOTH ACTUALLY AT THE TOP PACIFIC LEVEL BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS CONVERSATION. AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL WHERE EVERY COUNTY WITH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH PLAN. IS REQUIRED TO YES CHARITY PIECE THEY PLAN TO PLACE AND REGARDLESS OF THE COUNTY THAT THAT IT'S AND SO WE ARE NOW REALLY PRO ACTIVELY WORKING WITH COUNTIES TO ASK WHO ARE THE FACILITIES YOU NEED. TO AND DO YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PLANS HAVE OR PLAN TO HAVE. RELATIONSHIPS ARE FINANCIAL -- CONTRACTS WITH THOSE S. T. R. T. P. IS AND SO WE'RE REALLY TAKING A STEP BACK AND WORKING TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE COUNTY. AND THEY'RE IN A MENTAL HEALTH PLAN IS ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT WHO THEY BELIEVE THEY NEED AND THAT IS. A REALLY. IMPORTANT EFFORT THAT WERE THAT WERE EMBARKED ON RIGHT NOW THE COUNTIES OF ACTUALLY SUBMITTED US THEIR PLANS -- ALREADY AND NOW WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAPACITY NEED MATCHES -- AND SO WITH THAT I THINK THAT THAT'S THE COMMENTS THAT I WOULD LEAVE THE THE REST TO MY MY PARTNER EACH YES. THANK YOU SO MUCH MANAGER -- RENDER GREAT WISH DIETZ YES -- SO I THINK -- ARE MY COLLEAGUE MISS ROGERS ALREADY SAID QUITE A BIT OF WHAT WE'RE BEEN DOING I CAN GET A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT ON THE FIRST TIME I WAS UP HERE -- BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING EXTENSIVELY -- WITH -- CDSS BUT ALSO WITH OUR ASSOCIATIONS -- TO DO THE IT SOME REGULATIONS UP THROUGH BULLETIN AUTHORITY BUT WE'RE GOING TO PROMULGATE THEM INFORMAL REGULATIONS -- AND ARE THE CASE SPECIFIC ISSUES I THINK IT'S BEEN THE MOST INTENSIVE PIECE OF THAT SO THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT INDIVIDUAL CASES -- AND THAT'S PRIMARILY BEEN BETWEEN CDSS AND AND C. W. D. A AND C. B. H. TA SO I THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN ON A LOT OF LEARNING FROM WE KNOW FOR OUR TEAMS BUT ALSO -- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL AS FOLKS ARE JUST TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTING AND AND KIND OF WORKING THROUGH THOSE KINKS -- AND THEN S MISS ROGERS TALKED ABOUT THE STEP BY STEP PROCESS PROCESS I'M I THINK YOU KNOW WE WERE IN -- MEETINGS JUST SO MANY TIMES AND WE JUST KEPT SAYING YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST NEEDS TO BE LIKE A RECIPE OR SOMETHING THAT JUST. REALLY PRESCRIBES WHAT THAT BAT THINKING -- CHAIN NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE AND WHAT WHAT STEPS NEED TO HAPPEN AND SO -- SO WE WILL HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER ON BETWEEN THE ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S REALLY PUT A VERY PRESCRIPTIVE STEP BY STEP PROCESS TOGETHER -- SO -- WE'RE JUST ABOUT DONE WITH THE DRAFT ON THAT STUFF I COLDER I OKAY AND THEN. ULTIMATELY -- AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IN THIS MONTH IN MARCH AND THIS COMING MONTH AND SHORTLY THERE AFTER YOU KNOW IF WE IF WE DEPENDING ON THE FEEDBACK WE GET -- WERE PLANNING TO PUT THAT OUT IN A JOINT INFORMATION NOTICE ALL COUNTY LEVEL OR LETTER BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE CAN DISSEMINATE IT -- OUGHT TO THE COUNTY IS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE SO -- SO REALLY TRYING -- TO TO HELPS PROVIDE AS MUCH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WE CAN -- YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES SO THAT WE CAN -- DO WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP -- BUT IT REALLY SEEMS TO COME DOWN TO WILL -- YOU KNOW COMMUNICATION AND CALL IT'S REALLY GONNA KNOWING WHAT TO DO AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO -- I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO MODEL THAT AT OUR LEVELS AND THEN YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING TO SEE THAT -- HAPPEN IN THE COUNTIES AS WELL THANK YOU. HOME KATHY CENTER LÏNG. THANK MADAM CHAIR AND AS A MEMBER STONE -- APPRECIATE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS. I THINK ALL SORT OF GO ON THREE TRACKS SO THE FIRST IS RELATED TO THE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER. I THINK WHAT WE'RE FINDING AND LOOKING AT THE DATA IS THAT IT'S NOT LIKELY THAT THEY'LL BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SORT OF DO OR DON'T KIND OF ANSWER. THAT -- DATA -- I THINK ONE OF MY PRIOR PANELISTS MENTIONED WAS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE LARGER COUNTIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO WAIVE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER THAN SMALLER COUNTIES AND A WORSE TO BE THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A GREATER CAPACITY TO PROVIDE. THOSE SERVICES IN THEIR COUNTY OR CARE COORDINATE VIA THEIR COUNTY JUST YOU KNOW LARGER COUNTY OFTEN EQUALS LARGER RESOURCES. AND SO SORT OF THAT AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES AND THINKING ABOUT THAT PERHAPS SOLUTIONS THERE AND THE KIND OF WORK BOOKER COOKBOOK THAT MS GRAY LEDGE IS TALKING ABOUT. CAN HELP THAT COUNTY THINK ABOUT WHAT VERSUS WHAT THAT HOST COUNTY MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AND THEN MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE TRULY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD AND NOT JUST BASED ON KIND OF THE AVAILABILITY OF A PLACEMENT FOR EXAMPLE. RELATED TO THE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER WAVING IT OR NOT WAVING AT I THINK -- WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY TO SERVE OUR YOUTH IN OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THE EPS C. T. ENTITLEMENT IS THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT AS WELL AND THAT. FALL HEARING RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH -- IT'S IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT IF THE YOUTH HAS THAT NEED THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GET THAT FILLED. AND SO I THINK CONTINUING THE DISCUSSIONS THAT ALREADY EXIST RELATED TO IS THE PROBLEM THAT MORE MONEY IS NEEDED -- IS THERE A PROBLEM THAT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND PROVIDERS ARE THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO AUTHORIZE ADDITIONAL TYPES OF SERVICES -- DO WE NEED TO A GREATER CAPACITY TO DO KIND OF ONE OFF CONTRACTS WITH THE PARTICULAR PROVIDER. I FEEL LIKE ALL OF THOSE ARE LIKELY PART OF THE SOLUTION AND WERE THERE WERE THERE FOR EVERY CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE THINGS. I THINK NEED TO BE DISCUSSED AND THEN FINALLY I THINK THESE ARE REALLY I MEAN I I HESITATED A CALL THESE SOLUTIONS I I MIGHT CALL THEM HOPEFUL THINGS WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT BETTER. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE'S SORT OF ONE MAGIC WAND THE OF THESE ISSUES DON'T I'M. SORRY I LEFT IT I LEFT IT AT HOME -- AND THOUGH I KEEP LOOKING FOR IT AT ITS LOST -- I THINK I THINK ONE REALLY CRITICAL THING AND YOU'VE HEARD IT AS A THEME I THINK FOR ME AS WELL AS FROM SOME OF THE OTHER -- PANELIST IS WE'VE JUST GOT TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILY PLACEMENTS BETTER THAT -- GETTING THOSE SERVICES TO THEM TO THE YOUTH WHERE THEY ARE WRAPPING THEM AROUND THE SERVICES AND REALLY FIGURING OUT SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK WE'VE FIGURED OUT YET AS A STATE. WHICH IS HOW TO RECRUIT AND SUPPORT FAMILIES FOR USE WITH HIGHER NEEDS WE'D EXPECTED AND HOPED THAT THERE WOULD BE A A CADRE OF FAMILIES WHO WOULD BE WILLING AND ABLE. TO SUPPORT THOSE YOUTH OUTSIDE OF A GROUP HOME -- PERHAPS NOT THE RELATIVE OR PERHAPS A RELATIVE WITH SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN THOSE HOMES REALLY MATERIALIZE SORT OF THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE IS ONE WAY OF REFERRING TO THEM WHETHER IT IS. WELL IT'S CHILD SPECIFIC AND WE JUST NEED TO RECRUIT THEM AND WE JUST NEED TO GIVE THEM WHAT EVER THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO TO WORK WITH THAT YOUTH AND STABILIZE THAT FAMILY AND AND GET THEM THE SERVICES THAT THEY ALL NEED -- MAYBE THAT SAID -- SUPPORTING THEM IN THE MOMENT -- WE'VE GOT THAT SORT OF URGENT RESPONSE -- HOTLINE AND AND THINGS THAT WE WANT TO ARE GOING AS WELL AS WE WANT THEM TO TO BE ABLE TO STABILIZE THAT FAMILY AND HELP OVERCOME THAT. THERE'S THINGS THAT I WE THINK WE CAN DO -- TO BRING TO BEAR IT'S JUST A MATTER OF OF GETTING THOSE ALL IN PLACE AND WE'RE NOT THERE YET SO. MY THOUGHTS. TICKET GOES BACK TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS SPENT -- AND HOMES AND IF WE CAN USE THAT FOR THE FAMILIES TO SUPPORT THEM MISTER SCHROEDER. THAT SORT OF I THINK YOU'VE JUST BEEN CAPS ELATED SIR WHAT'S THE C. R. HAS BEEN ABOUT WHICH IS HOW DO WE TAKE. MONEY THAT WE WERE PREVIOUSLY SPENDING FOR FOR PRETTY EXPENSIVE RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENTS IN THE THAT MONEY -- INTO -- FAMILY BASED -- SETTINGS FOR FOR YOUTH AND THEN WRAP SERVICES SUPPORT AROUND THAT FAMILY THAT YOUNG PERSON SO THAT THEY CAN SUCCEED. SO I THINK YOU'VE YOU'VE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD SO I THINK WE'VE GOT THE MECHANISMS IN PLACE THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE MAKE THIS MECHANISMS WORK -- I I EITHER THERE A COUPLE THINGS THAT THAT COME TO MIND AS IT IS I THINK ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER. AND ONE IS THAT THAT CONTINUES CARRY FORM. SORTOF PRESUMED AND THEN MADE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ABOUT -- INTEGRATION OF EFFORTS BETWEEN -- COUNTY MIDDLE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND AND CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENTS IN JUVENILE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS IN TERMS OF THOSE YOUTH WHO NEED -- AND SOME TYPE OF OUT OF HOME CARE IT'S STILL -- IS SOMETHING IT'S IN PROCESS -- THE A I THINK THAT -- THAT ONE OF THE THINGS I I CAN'T REMEMBER DIANA POINTED OUT OR NOT -- BUT IF YOU HAVE A A PARTICULAR -- CHILD WELFARE AB DEPARTMENT IS PREPARED TO PLACE A CHILD WITH A PARTICULAR STR TP. BUT THE MENTAL HEALTH -- PLAN IN THAT PARTICULAR COUNTY DOESN'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. THEN ONE OF THINGS YOU CAN DO IS JUST AND AND THEN IT BECOMES THE RESPONSIBILITY THE RECEIVING COUNTY. AND I AND I I I THINK THAT -- THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT AGAIN WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LOOK AT AT WHAT IT MEANS IN TERMS OF THAT KIND OF CARE FOR KIDS AND AND ENSURING THAT THAT THAT DOES OCCUR. AND THAT THOSE EFFORTS ARE COORDINATED. I THINK THE THE BOTTOM LINE IS IN THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT FROM DAY ONE IS TO ENSURE. THAT YOU GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT NAY NOTHING NEEDED FOR AS LONG AS THEY NEED IT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT -- AND THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE'S A POSITIVE OUTCOME FOR THAT -- FOR THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR MEMBER AGENCIES A PIECE OF THAT IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE PART OF THAT CAN'T BE SO ONEROUS THAT THEY SAY WELL. NOW WITH I'M NOT GONNA DO IT YOU KNOW I'M NOT GONNA BECOME AN S. HERE TOO BECAUSE I CAN'T DO THIS MENTAL HEALTH STUFF -- IN NOT TOO SMALL IS THIS THAT SMALL COUNTIES THAT SMALL PROVIDERS HAVE EVER SIMILAR ISSUE -- AND SO I I I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT PIECE AS WELL SO THAT ANY FIX THAT WE COME UP FOR THIS INSURES THAT THE YOU'VE GOT WITH A NEED. BUT ALSO ENSURES THAT THE FOLKS ARE PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM AND ABLE TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T BECOME ADMINISTRATIVELY SO BURDENSOME. THAT PEOPLE. JUST DON'T DO IT OR AS THANK YOU. FOR LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST. CAT THANK YOU CONSIDER MEN FROM C. B. H. TA. AM I REALLY WANT TO ACTUALLY -- TELL YOU MISS HIM HERNANDEZ THAT YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT -- THE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS ARE EXPERIENCING ABOUT AN AVERAGE OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH PER CHILD PLACED IN RESIDENTIAL CARE. IN AN S. HERE T. P. THAT'S PROVIDING MEDICAL SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND TO THAT END AGAIN THE WHOLE -- QUESTION OF WAIVER OR NOT THERE IS THE THE ASSOCIATION FORMALLY FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT -- WAIVER THAT THAT. FOR THOSE CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN -- EST HERE TEEPEES THAT RESPONSIBILITY RICH BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST TWO LETTERS ARE SHORT TERM. ALONG WITH THE PLACING COUNTY FOR THAT MENTAL HEALTH PLAN TO CONTINUE A CONTINUITY OF CARE BECAUSE THAT WE WANT THOSE CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO COME BACK HOME. SO THAT IS VERY MUCH IF YOU TAKE THE DAHLE MENTAL HEALTH DOLLAR AMOUNT AND THE PLACE AND THE RESIDENTIAL RATE AMOUNT TOGETHER YOUR YOUR YOUR SPOT ON AND SO I WANTED TO SAY THAT. THE OTHER THING WELL TO NOT TALK ABOUT FINANCE FOR A MINUTE. IS THAT JUST AS ACTUALLY AS AN ADOPTEE. AND SO SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT -- SIXTY YEARS AGO -- OR MORE -- ADOPTED IN BEING ADOPTED IN A DAY AND AGE THAT THAT WAS NOT THE NORM THAT WAS NOT COMMON. AND AND BI RACIAL ADOPTIONS WAS DEFINITELY NOT COMMENT MY MAIDEN NAME IS HE WORKED. WHICH IS A VERY GERMAN NAME -- SO -- YOU KNOW MY SISTER AND I WERE TO OF FOR NON WHITES IN THE TOWN WE GREW UP IN. SO WE WE WHAT I KNOW IS THAT TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. TRAINING IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE BOTH -- FOR THE PLACING AGENCIES FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS FOR THE FOR THE FAMILIES THE PARENTS AND FAMILIES WHO WORK SERVING THE CHILDREN BUT WHO ARE ALSO THE HOPEFULLY. THE THE KICK THE PARENTS WERE GETTING THEIR CHILDREN BACK ARE LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING SOME OF WHAT'S GOING ON SO I THINK THAT. TRADE IS REALLY CRITICAL AND SO WE MORE MORE MORE ACROSS THE BOARD WITH YOUR PROVIDER OR A KIT -- CARE GIVER OF ANY KIND SO I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL AND THEN DEFINITELY -- AS WE LOOK AT JUST THE UNFORTUNATELY JUST STICKS OF SERVICE THERE ARE DOCUMENTS AND THE SOONER THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE LINED UP AS A DETERMINATION IS MADE ON WHERE THE CHILD IN YOU THIS CHILD OR YOUTH IS GOING TO GO. THE SOONER THOSE THINGS ARE LINED UP SO WHEN THAT CHILD GOES WERE EVER THEY'RE GOING WHETHER LOCALLY OR OUT OF COUNTY. EVERYTHING IS GOOD TO GO SO THAT IMMEDIATELY JUST AS WE SAID THE MINUTE THAT CHILD. GOES SOMEWHERE SERVICES FOLLOW FOR CAN START AND I JUST THINK THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW THE MORE SUPPORT WE CAN PROVIDE THOSE CHILDREN WITH CONTINUITY OF CARE THE BETTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH IT JUST AND TAKING A FEW NOTES I THINK I HAVE OVER -- TWENTY FIVE SUGGESTIONS. AND I I I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE YOU YOU COME FROM DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES. SOME FROM THE VERY EXPERIENCE. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ON AS FOSTER YOUTH -- THE YARD IN A DISTINCT -- SITUATION WHERE YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCES ARE GOING TO HELP US AS WE SHAPE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WORKING IN ADMIN SERVICES YOU HAVE THE THE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE OF HAVING WORKED IN THIS. SO YOU KNOW WHAT HAS WORKED WHAT HASN'T WORKED I WOULD IMAGINE SOMETIMES YOUR HANDS ARE TIED YOU MAY BE THINKING WE REALLY SHOULD BE DOING THIS BUT THE LAW SAYS I'VE GOT TO DO THIS. WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU WE WANT TO SEE WHAT IT IS BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT A COMMENT MADE BY -- MY COLLEAGUE MARK STONE USES WE HAVE TO MAKE THE SYSTEM RESPONSIVE TO THE KIDS. IT THAT'S THAT HAS TO BE AT THE VERY TOP OF THE LIST IT ISN'T ABOUT HOW MANY REPORTS WE RIGHT OR WHO'S GOING TO PAY AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PAY. ALTHOUGH THAT IS IMPORTANT. BUT IT IS WHAT IS BEST FOR THE KIDS AND I AM VERY PROUD TO HAVE ALL OF YOU WORKING ON FINDING THOSE SOLUTIONS AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH.

I THINK YOU HEARD SOME REALLY GOOD COMMENTS FROM EVERYBODY -- ON THE PANEL ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP IMPROVE IT BUT THE LAST COMMENT I THINK IT IT BELIEVE IT WAS MS SUDIRMAN OR PERHAPS YOU MISSED CHAIR.
