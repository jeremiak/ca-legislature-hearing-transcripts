CAP BANKING PROVISIONS HOLDING

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.322

LEAKAGE PROTECTION OFFSET RULES

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:15.560
AND NOW THE PRICE CEILING AND

00:33:15.626 --> 00:33:17.195
THE PRICE CONTAINMENT POINTS ALL

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:18.996
OF THOSE WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO

00:33:19.063 --> 00:33:20.398
ACHIEVE THIS GOAL.

00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:21.799
I'M OUR OTHER GOALS ARE ALSO

00:33:21.866 --> 00:33:23.501
LISTED ON FLIGHT TO IN YOUR

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:25.970
HANDOUT. AS MANDATED BY AB

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:27.472
THIRTY TWO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE

00:33:27.538 --> 00:33:29.040
EARLY AND VOLUNTARY EMISSION

00:33:29.107 --> 00:33:30.775
REDUCTIONS.

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.377
WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN AND CONTINUE

00:33:32.443 --> 00:33:35.012
TO ATTRACT LINKAGE PARTNERS.

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:36.080
AND TO MAINTAIN THE MULTITUDE OF

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:37.949
BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM'S MARKET

00:33:38.015 --> 00:33:39.917
FEATURES COST EFFECTIVENESS

00:33:39.984 --> 00:33:41.386
FLEXIBILITY. AND MINIMIZING

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:43.287
LEAKAGE.

00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:44.922
SO ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THE

00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:45.723
COMMITTEE SPECIFICALLY ASKED

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.692
ABOUT. WITH THE AB THREE NINETY

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:50.094
EIGHT MANDATED ANALYSIS OF QUOTE

00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:51.729
OVER ALLOCATION IN THE STATE

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:53.464
BOARDS DETERMINATION OF THE

00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:55.433
NUMBER OF AVAILABLE ALLOWANCES

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.001
FOR YEARS TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO

00:33:57.068 --> 00:33:58.503
TWENTY THIRTY.

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:00.972
SO WHAT'S THIS REALLY ABOUT.

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:02.573
IN CALIFORNIA WHERE IN THE

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.841
ENVIABLE POSITION

00:34:03.908 --> 00:34:06.043
I BEING AHEAD OF SCOTT.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.845
SO WE'VE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE

00:34:07.912 --> 00:34:09.447
GONNA MEET OUR TWENTY TWENTY

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:11.682
TARGET EARLY. AND SO THIS MEANS

00:34:11.749 --> 00:34:14.218
THAT EMISSIONS ARE LOWER THAN WE

00:34:14.285 --> 00:34:15.653
THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.754
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT

00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:18.689
COVERED ENTITIES DON'T HAVE TO

00:34:18.756 --> 00:34:21.659
TURN IN AND MANY ALLOWANCES. AS

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:22.260
WE THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO

00:34:22.326 --> 00:34:23.594
HAVE TO.

00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:24.462
SO THERE'S A CONCERN BY IF YOU

00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:26.197
THAT THESE UNUSED ALLOWANCES THE

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:28.399
ONES YOU DON'T NEED IN THE PRE

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:30.368
TWENTY TWENTY. MAY HINDER OUR

00:34:30.435 --> 00:34:32.170
ABILITY TO MEET THE TWENTY

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:33.704
THIRTY TARGET.

00:34:33.771 --> 00:34:36.507
I'M SOME BELIEVE THAT WERE AHEAD

00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:37.842
ENTITIES HAVE TAKEN EARLY

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.178
ACTIONS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. AND

00:34:40.244 --> 00:34:42.079
THEY SHOULDN'T BE PENALIZED.

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:43.314
A FEW PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT

00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:44.782
REGARDLESS OF WHY EMISSIONS ARE

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:47.084
LOWER UNUSED ALLOWANCES SHOULD

00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:49.120
BE REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM EVEN

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:50.688
THAT'S IT IF THIS INCREASES

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:53.224
COSTS THE ECONOMY. AND FUEL AND

00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:54.859
ENERGY COSTS FOR CONSUMERS.

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.427
WE CAN ALL AGREE I THINK THAT

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:57.328
IT'S A GOOD THING THAT WERE

00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:59.030
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE THAT'S A GOOD

00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:00.531
PLACE FOR US TO BE. AND IT'S A

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:02.233
GOOD THING THAT WERE ON TRACK TO

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.468
ACHIEVE THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET

00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:06.370
EARLY. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE AS WE

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:07.772
LOOK POST TWENTY TWENTY WE'RE

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.273
LOOKING AT HAVING TO DOUBLE THE

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.509
RATE OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS SO

00:35:11.576 --> 00:35:13.244
WE'RE LOOKING AT A STEEPENING OF

00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:15.513
THE CURVE.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.415
I WON A NOTE THAT DROPPING POST

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:18.883
TWENTY TWENTY CAPS I HAVE

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.318
BECAUSE WERE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE

00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:22.520
MAY ENCOURAGE ENTITIES TO DO THE

00:35:22.587 --> 00:35:24.922
MINIMUM. IT COULD DISCOURAGE

00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:26.557
EARLY COMPLIANCE BY SENDING THE

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:28.526
MESSAGE THAT WE COULD MAKE THE

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:30.127
PROGRAM MORE STRINGENT IF THE

00:35:30.194 --> 00:35:31.963
EMISSIONS ARE LOWER. AND THIS

00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:33.631
APPROACH COULD LEAD TO A HIGHER

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:35.800
COST PROGRAM.

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:37.902
IN RESPONSE THE DIRECTION IN AB

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:39.837
THREE NINETY EIGHT US STAFF

00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:41.405
COMPLETED AND MADE PUBLIC. AN

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:43.374
INITIAL ANALYSIS LAST MONTH

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:44.775
WHICH WE RECEIVE WHICH WE

00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:46.978
RELEASED FOR STAKEHOLDER COMMENT

00:35:47.044 --> 00:35:48.379
AND MORE INTERESTED I'M YOU KNOW

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:49.614
WE'VE GOT SOME COMMENTS AND WERE

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.249
INTERESTED IN FEEDBACK FROM THIS

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:52.450
COMMITTEE AS WELL.

00:35:52.517 --> 00:35:53.784
I AM I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:55.653
THE ANALYSIS OF ANYTHING THAT

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.054
YOU'RE ANALYZING TWELVE YEARS

00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:58.489
OUT INTO THE FUTURE IS GOING TO

00:35:58.556 --> 00:36:00.391
HAVE SOME UNCERTAINTIES AND I

00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:01.225
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP

00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:03.027
IN MIND. WE'VE LISTED SOME OF

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:04.896
THOSE UNCERTAINTIES ON THE SLIDE

00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:06.531
ON SLIDE FOR.

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:07.965
I AM I WANT TO START WITH THE

00:36:08.032 --> 00:36:10.668
GRAPH THAT'S ON SLIDE FIVE. AND

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:12.336
IT SHOWS PROJECTED EMISSIONS.

00:36:12.403 --> 00:36:14.472
AND PARKS.

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:16.107
AND SO THE SLIDE IS A LITTLE BIT

00:36:16.173 --> 00:36:17.475
COMPLICATED SOME TO TRY TO TALK

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:18.843
THROUGH IT AND EXPLAIN WHAT'S

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.979
HERE. SO THE BARS ON THIS SHOW

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:24.148
EMISSIONS.

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:26.784
AND THE LINES SHOW CAPS.

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:28.653
SO THE GREEN BARS REPRESENT THE

00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:30.488
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:32.924
CAP AND TRADE COVERED SECTORS.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.393
OF TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY AND

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:38.195
ENERGY AND INCLUDES THE IMPACT

00:36:38.262 --> 00:36:40.798
OF COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES LIKE

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:43.167
THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:44.936
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

00:36:45.002 --> 00:36:46.837
ADVANCE CLEAN CARS.

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:48.573
AND WHAT YOU SEE ON THE GREEN

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:50.207
LINE THOSE ARE THE POST TWENTY

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:52.310
TWENTY CAPS.

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:54.045
IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.

00:36:54.111 --> 00:36:55.346
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE GREEN

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:57.181
LINE IS LOWER THAT THE GREEN

00:36:57.248 --> 00:36:58.883
BARS.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.151
THAT THE CAPS IN THE CAP AND

00:37:00.217 --> 00:37:02.219
TRADE PROGRAM CONSTRAIN

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:04.088
EMISSIONS SAID WE WERE EXPECTING

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.590
MORE MISSIONS THAN WHAT YOU

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:07.291
WOULD THEN WHERE THE CAPS ARE.

00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:08.926
YEAH WE SHOW SIMILAR INFORMATION

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:10.795
FOR TO PORTAL GREENHOUSE GAS

00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:13.197
EMISSIONS SO IF YOU ADD ON THOSE

00:37:13.264 --> 00:37:15.766
BLUE ANDS THOSE ARE THE

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.835
UNCOVERED SECTORS SUCH THINGS

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:20.071
LIKE AGRICULTURE. QUITE GLOBAL

00:37:20.137 --> 00:37:22.239
WARMING POTENTIAL GASES AND THEN

00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:24.575
THE DOTTED LINE ABOVE IS SORT OF

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:26.944
THE OCCULT THE GLIDE PATH OF THE

00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:28.346
SCOPING PLAN.

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:29.947
YOU CAN SEE THE BLUE DOT AT THE

00:37:30.014 --> 00:37:31.248
END THAT'S THE TWENTY THIRTY

00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:32.383
TARGET.

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:33.818
A TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:36.420
METRIC TONS AND AGAIN YOU CAN

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:37.822
SEE THAT THE SCOPING PLANT THERE

00:37:37.888 --> 00:37:39.657
I'M SCRUBBING PLANNED TARGET IS

00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:42.226
LOWER THAN. THE ON A MISSIONS

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:44.829
THAT ARE EXPECTED SO AGAIN YOU

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:46.464
KNOW WE NEED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.165
TO HIT OUR TARGETS.

00:37:48.232 --> 00:37:49.967
NOW WITHOUT GETTING INTO TOO

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:51.769
MANY OF THE DETAILS BASICALLY

00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:53.804
WHAT OUR ANALYSIS DID IT LOOK AT

00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:56.374
WHETHER THE POTENTIAL UNUSED

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.409
ALLOWANCES. FROM PRE TWENTY

00:37:58.476 --> 00:37:59.944
TWENTY SO ALL OF THESE

00:38:00.011 --> 00:38:02.213
ALLOWANCES ARE GETTING USE NOW

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:04.782
WILL ERASE ALL OF THE BENEFIT

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:07.652
BETWEEN THE CAP THE GREEN LINE.

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:09.687
AND THE PROJECT THAT EMISSIONS

00:38:09.754 --> 00:38:11.489
THOSE TOP OF THE GREEN BARS.

00:38:11.555 --> 00:38:13.190
SO TO DO THIS WE LOOK AT HOW

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:14.558
MANY ALLOWANCES MIGHT BE

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:15.326
AVAILABLE FOR PROPOSED TWENTY

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:17.762
TWENTY.

00:38:17.828 --> 00:38:19.397
SO THAT INCLUDES THE POST TWENTY

00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:21.432
TWENTY ALLOWANCES SO WHAT YOU

00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:21.966
KNOW WHAT DOES THE PROGRAM

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:22.700
PRODUCE.

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:24.402
OFFSETS

00:38:24.468 --> 00:38:25.603
AND IT ALSO INCLUDES THE

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.505
ALLOWANCES THAT MIGHT BE CARRIED

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:30.341
OVER. FROM PRE TWENTY TWENTY AND

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:31.676
THEN WE COMPARED THAT AGAINST

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:33.778
THE EMISSIONS THAT ARE EXPECTED

00:38:33.844 --> 00:38:35.379
POST TWENTY TWENTY.

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:37.114
SO WE DID TWO SCENARIOS WE DID

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:39.150
ONE SCENARIO WHERE WE CARRIED

00:38:39.216 --> 00:38:40.017
OVER THE PRE TWENTY TWENTY

00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:41.385
EMISSIONS.

00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:42.953
AND WE DID ONE SCENARIO THAT WE

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.188
DID NOT CARRY OVER THE PRE

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:46.524
TWENTY TWENTY EMISSIONS.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.992
OUR ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT IN

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:49.827
BOTH SCENARIOS OPPOSE TWENTY

00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:51.729
TWENTY CAPS.

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:53.030
WILL CONSTRAIN GREENHOUSE GAS

00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:55.232
EMISSIONS AND CONTINUE TO

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:57.368
SUPPORT A STEADILY INCREASING

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:58.969
CARBON PRICE SIGNAL. AS

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:00.638
ALLOWANCES BECOME PROGRESSIVELY

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:02.707
MORE SCARCE.

00:39:02.773 --> 00:39:04.408
NOW THE LEVEL OF THE CAP IS KEY

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:06.310
TO OUR PROGRAM.

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:07.578
AND I WANNA POINT OUT THAT THE

00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:09.613
CAPS IN OUR PROGRAMMER SAT USING

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.182
REPORTED DATA. AND THE

00:39:11.248 --> 00:39:13.084
REFRACTIVE REFLECTS LESSONS

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.318
LEARNED AND OTHER TRADING

00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:16.320
PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE EU ETS AND

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:17.955
REGGIE.

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:19.457
THESE PROGRAMS DIFFER FROM MARS

00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:21.025
AND THREE IMPORTANT WAYS.

00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:22.793
FIRST OF ALL.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.295
THEY DIDN'T RELY ON REPORTED

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:27.031
DATA WHEN THEY SET THEIR CAPS.

00:39:27.098 --> 00:39:28.933
THEY EITHER HAVE NO PRICE FLOOR

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:30.334
WHERE THEY HAVE A PRICE FLOOR

00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:32.436
THAT'S TOO LOW TO SORT OF

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:34.205
ENCOURAGE REDUCTIONS.

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:35.973
AND THEY ALSO DIDN'T ANTICIPATE

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.208
HAVING TO HAVE SORT OF AN

00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:39.610
AUTOMATIC WAY TO REMOVE UNSOLD

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:41.479
ALLOWANCES.

00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:43.214
SO BECAUSE OF THAT BOTH OF THOSE

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.615
PROGRAMS HAVE HAD TO HAVE

00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:46.150
SIGNIFICANT CORRECTIONS OR

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:47.852
ADJUSTMENTS.

00:39:47.918 --> 00:39:49.153
I'M TO CORRECT FOR OVER

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.988
ALLOCATION SO THAT THEY HAD A

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:52.456
HIGH ENOUGH PRICE

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:54.658
TO PROMPT EMISSION REDUCTIONS.

00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:56.594
SO WHAT HAPPENS

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.963
TO US WHAT WE'D DO IF EMISSIONS

00:39:59.029 --> 00:40:00.898
ARE LOW AND WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:02.600
ALLOWANCES. WILL THE CALIFORNIA

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:04.201
PROGRAM ALREADY INCLUDES A

00:40:04.268 --> 00:40:06.403
FEATURE FOR TRANSFERRING UNSOLD

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:08.806
AUCTION ALLOWANCES INTO THE HIGH

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:10.374
PRICE RESERVE AFTER EIGHT

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:11.976
AUCTIONS.

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:13.811
SO WITH ALLOWANCES DOWN DON'T

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:16.480
SELL AFTER TWO YEARS THEY GET

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:17.848
MOVED INTO THE HIGH PRICE

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:20.017
RESERVE. AND THIS IS A PROVISION

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:22.153
THAT'S NOW CODIFIED AS PART OF

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:23.587
AB THREE NINETY EIGHT.

00:40:23.654 --> 00:40:24.989
NO WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THIS

00:40:25.055 --> 00:40:26.791
MECHANISM IS GONNA TRANSFER AT

00:40:26.857 --> 00:40:28.559
LEAST FORTY MILLION UNSOLD

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.995
ALLOWANCES INTO THE RESERVE.

00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:32.730
DEPENDING ON HOW OPTIONS GO THIS

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:33.831
YEAR THERE MAY BE MORE

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:35.032
ALLOWANCES TRANSFERRED INTO THAT

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:36.801
RESERVE.

00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:38.269
I AM I WANT TO KNOW THAT THE

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:40.104
COMMITTEE REPORTS LIKE THE PAPER

00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:41.505
THAT CLAIMS THERE'S AN ERROR IN

00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:43.174
OUR STAFF ANALYSIS.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.009
REVIEW REVIEWED THE PAPER AND

00:40:45.075 --> 00:40:46.677
EVALUATED THAT CLAIM OUR

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:48.412
CONCLUSION IS THAT THERE IS NO

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:50.447
ERROR IN OUR ANALYSIS.

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:51.849
SIMPLY PUT THE PAPER DOESN'T

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:53.184
REALIZE THAT WE MADE AN

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.852
ADJUSTMENT AND IT MAKES THAT

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:56.987
ADJUSTMENT AGAIN.

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:58.556
THE OTHER SPECIFIC ISSUE IS THAT

00:40:58.622 --> 00:40:59.824
THE PAPER CLAIMS THAT OUR

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.559
ANALYSIS DOESN'T ADJUST.

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:03.060
I CAPS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:04.895
PORTIONS OF COVERED SECTORS THAT

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:06.797
ARE NOT COVERED FOR EXAMPLE

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:08.132
FUGITIVE EMISSIONS FROM THE

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:09.934
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.669
SO THIS ISN'T TRUE.

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:13.170
OUR CAPS IN THE POST TWENTY

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:15.406
TWENTY PROGRAM ARE SET BASED

00:41:15.472 --> 00:41:16.574
ONLY ON THE PORTION OF THE

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.575
INVENTORY THAT'S COVERED BY THE

00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:19.210
PROGRAM.

00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:20.611
JUST LIKE THE CAPS IN THE PRE

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:22.947
TWENTY TWENTY PROGRAM.

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.381
IN ADDITION FOR THE POST TWENTY

00:41:24.448 --> 00:41:25.983
TWENTY PROGRAM.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.319
BECAUSE WE ANTICIPATED WHEN WE

00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:29.386
DID OUR PROJECTIONS THAT

00:41:29.453 --> 00:41:30.554
EMISSIONS WERE GOING TO BE LOWER

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:32.189
THAN WE PREDICTED.

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:34.358
WE ACTUALLY LOWERED THE NUMBER

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:36.327
OF ALLOWANCES THAT WE WOULD

00:41:36.393 --> 00:41:38.495
PROVIDE SO WE ACTUALLY REDUCE

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:39.597
THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES BY

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:42.499
NINETY FOUR MILLION METRIC TONS.

00:41:42.566 --> 00:41:43.801
AND THOSE EXTRA ALLOWANCES ARE

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:45.002
GOING TO GO INTO THE HIGH PRICE

00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:47.204
RESERVE. SO WE TAKE OUT THOSE

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:49.240
ALLOWANCES BECAUSE WE KNOW

00:41:49.306 --> 00:41:51.542
EMISSIONS ARE GONNA BE LOWER.

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:53.310
SO TURNING NOW TO ANOTHER AREA

00:41:53.377 --> 00:41:54.111
THAT THE COMMITTEE ASKED ABOUT

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:55.980
OFFSETS.

00:41:56.046 --> 00:41:57.681
SO UPSETS ARE AN IMPORTANT COST

00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:59.316
CONTAINMENT FEATURE IN OUR

PROGRAMS ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY

00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:03.200
FEASIBLE NOT IMPEDING PROGRESS

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:05.169

THAT'S IT'S TWELVE YEARS AWAY.

00:45:25.756 --> 00:45:27.091
AND IN THAT TWELVE YEARS YOU

00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:28.225

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:29.393
UNCERTAINTY AND HOW MANY

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.195
REDUCTIONS ARE REGULATIONS ARE

00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:32.596
GOING TO GET. HOW QUICKLY

00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:35.032
TECHNOLOGY PRESS PROGRESSES

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:37.067
I'M POWER ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:39.636
PERFORMING TWELVE YEARS FROM NOW?

00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:40.270
SO IN THE FACE OF THAT

00:45:40.337 --> 00:45:41.905
UNCERTAINTY HOW DO WE TRACK OUR

00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:43.674
PROGRESS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.642
WE'RE GONNA STAY ON THE PATH

OCCURRING.

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:44.868
IF IT APPEARS THAT EMISSIONS ARE

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:47.271
NOT DECLINING IS EXPECTED WE

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:49.540
NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY. IS IT

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:51.441
BECAUSE WE HAD A OF A REALLY DRY

00:46:51.508 --> 00:46:53.577
YEAR AND SO WE HAD TO HAVE MORE

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:54.711
ELECT NEO FOSSIL FUEL

00:46:54.778 --> 00:46:56.513
ELECTRICITY GENERATION BECAUSE

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.048
WE DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH HYDRO.

00:46:58.115 --> 00:46:59.349

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:21.832
GO BACK TO THE COMMENT ABOUT THE

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:23.500
GUY CHALLENGES WITH THE.

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:25.736
IN STATE OFFSETS THAT THE

00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:28.272
CHALLENGES THAT YOU FORESEE A.

00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:30.173
HEARING YOU CANNOT ELABORATE LOW.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.042
SO WHEN YOU SAY CHALLENGES YOU

00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.943
MENTIONED THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:34.978
DIFFICULT RIGHT TO HAVE DIRECT

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:35.812
BENEFIT.

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:37.447
ó YEAH I DO NOT AND I DID NOT

00:48:37.514 --> 00:48:38.815
MEAN TO IMPLY THAT IT WOULD BE

00:48:38.882 --> 00:48:40.117
DIFFICULT TO HAVE DIRECT

00:48:40.183 --> 00:48:41.718
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS I THINK.

00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:43.387
WHAT AND WHAT I MEANT TO CONVEY

00:48:43.453 --> 00:48:45.555
IF IT WAS NOT CLEAR IS THAT WE

00:48:45.622 --> 00:48:46.923
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:48.825
LEGISLATIVE INTEREST IN INTENSE

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:50.661
AS PART OF THREE NINETY EIGHT TO

00:48:50.727 --> 00:48:53.030
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF? IN STATE

00:48:53.096 --> 00:48:54.331
OFFSETS

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:56.833
I'M AND WE ARE AT THAT IS

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:57.868
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE AWARE OF

00:48:57.934 --> 00:48:59.536
HIS WERE GOING THROUGH THE RULE

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:01.605
MAKING PROCESS. AS YOU KNOW AB

00:49:01.672 --> 00:49:03.674
THREE NINETY EIGHT ALSO SET UP A

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.009
COMPLAINTS OFFSET COMMITTEE OR

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:07.244
TASK FORCE I CAN'T REMEMBER

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:08.745
EXACTLY WHAT IT'S CALLED. AND TO

00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:10.480
LOOK AT HOW WE CAN INCREASE THE

00:49:10.547 --> 00:49:12.215
NUMBER OF IN STATE ASSETS POST

00:49:12.282 --> 00:49:13.483
TWENTY TWENTY.

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:15.485
SO AND THAT'S A COMMITTEE THAT

00:49:15.552 --> 00:49:17.421
WE ARE IN THE PROCESS THAT.

00:49:17.487 --> 00:49:18.855
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:21.191
THE APPROPRIATE I'M INTO GROUPS

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:22.359
OF PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:24.561
REPRESENTED AS WE CONSIDER THAT

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:25.629
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:27.130
THAT WOULD YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:28.265
TELL YOU THAT WE ARE ALSO.

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:30.400
INTERESTED IN SEEING MORE IN

00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:32.202
STATE OFFSETS AS WE MOVE FORWARD

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:35.739
ALSO ANTICIPATE A. MAJOR HURDLES

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:36.640
AND MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION.

00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:38.809
WELL. IT'S

00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:39.943
I THINK IT'S IT'S HARD TO SAY

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:41.545
THINK THE CHALLENGES THAT WE

00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:44.981
HAVE OVERALL OFFSETS OR. THAT IN.

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:48.585
AT AS PART OF OUR PROGRAM WE

00:49:48.652 --> 00:49:49.853
LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TERROR TO

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.788
REGULATE. TO HAVE.

00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:53.757
REQUIRED EMISSION REDUCTIONS

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:55.092
INSTEAD OF VOLUNTARY EMISSION

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:57.060
REDUCTIONS AND IN SOME CASES IN

00:49:57.127 --> 00:49:59.029
THE PAST WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.263
YOU DON'T SEE AS MANY

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:01.965
OPPORTUNITIES. TO HAVE THESE

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:04.167
VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE'VE

00:50:04.234 --> 00:50:06.269
REGULATED THEM INSTEAD AND SO I

00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:07.704
THINK THAT THE AND THE

00:50:07.771 --> 00:50:09.806
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT WE

00:50:09.873 --> 00:50:11.975
HAVE MAKES IT SOMETIMES IT'S

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:12.776
SORT OF NARROWS THE.

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:15.112
OF WHAT'S AVAILABLE FOR OFFSETS

00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:16.646
ON BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

00:50:16.713 --> 00:50:18.415
THINK THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO

00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:19.516
WORK THROUGH IN THERE MAY BE

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:21.118
SOME SECTORS WHERE WE MAY BE

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:23.387
ABLE TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS.

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:23.920
SO WE'VE HAD A QUESTION.

00:50:23.987 --> 00:50:26.690
I REYES TO OUR OFFICE QUITE

00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:28.225
OFTEN AS IT RELATES TO.

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:29.760
HOW YOU DETERMINED?

00:50:29.826 --> 00:50:32.629
THE IMPACTS OF THE RECESSION.

00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:34.097
AT TWO THOUSAND TEN TWO THOUSAND

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:35.699
FOURTEEN WHERE AREAS WERE WHAT

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:37.434
THEY WERE POINTED OUT.

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:38.301
THE CHAIR NOW.

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.837
CAN'T CREDIT SOME OF THE.

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:43.407
IMPACTS RIGHT OF BY THE

00:50:43.473 --> 00:50:46.343
RECESSION TO LOWER EMISSION

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.178
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND SO THEN THE

00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:49.646
QUESTION IS WHAT YOU KNOW. WHAT

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:51.381
WE JUST?

00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:52.315
MOVING FORWARD.

00:50:52.382 --> 00:50:54.317
.

00:50:54.384 --> 00:50:55.585
THE CAT TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:57.287
RECESSION.

00:50:57.354 --> 00:50:59.389
AT THIS POINT SO I HAVE A I HAVE

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:01.358
A DOG EXHILARATING SLIDE FOR YOU.

00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:03.794
AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.096
THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT.

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:08.799
TRENDS YOU CAN DEFINITELY SEE

00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:11.168
THIS IS A GRAPH THAT SHOWS.

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:13.403
GRACE DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND ALSO

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.739
GHG PER PER GROSS DOMESTIC

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:17.741
PRODUCT SEE YOU CAN SEE IN TWO

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:18.809
THOUSAND AND EIGHT THERE'S A BIG

00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:20.110
DIP IN THE GROSS DOMESTIC

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:21.878
PRODUCT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:51:21.945 --> 00:51:24.448
EMISSIONS YOU SEE A BIG DIP IN

00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:25.782
TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ALSO.

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:27.050
I'M FROM HARPER'S AND WHAT

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:28.552
YOU'VE SEEN SINCE THEN IN THE

00:51:28.618 --> 00:51:30.620
LAST TEN YEARS IS THE LARGEST

00:51:30.687 --> 00:51:32.122
SUSTAINED PERIOD OF ECONOMIC

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:33.390
GROWTH THAT CALIFORNIA HAS EVER

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:34.591
SEEN.

00:51:34.658 --> 00:51:35.759
THE THING THAT WE FIND VERY

00:51:35.826 --> 00:51:38.328
HEARTENING THE THING THAT WE SEE.

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:38.562
IS THAT.

00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:40.297
.

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:44.167
THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR STATE IS

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:46.403
INCREASING SO EVEN THOUGH THE

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.239
ECONOMIC OUTPUT IS INCREASING WE

00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:51.374
ARE NOT SEEING. INCREASE WE ARE

00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:53.543
NOT SEEN COMMENSURATE INCREASES

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:55.445
IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO

00:51:55.512 --> 00:51:56.613
IF YOU LOOK AT GREENHOUSE GAS

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.081
EMISSION TRENDS OVER THIS TIME

00:51:58.148 --> 00:51:59.783
WHAT YOU SEE IS THE ECONOMY IS

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.852
GETTING BETTER. AND THE WE ARE

00:52:01.918 --> 00:52:03.119
GETTING MORE EFFICIENT AT THE

00:52:03.186 --> 00:52:05.789
SAME TIME SO WE HAVE ACCOUNTED

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:08.091
FOR THAT. BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN AS

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:09.259
WE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE OTHER

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:10.327
METRICS

00:52:10.393 --> 00:52:10.961
THAT.

00:52:11.027 --> 00:52:13.263
OUR INDUSTRIES ARE ACTUALLY

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:14.564
GETTING MORE EFFICIENT AND I

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:16.132
THINK THAT THIS IS A BIG SUCCESS

00:52:16.199 --> 00:52:17.334
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.703
CALIFORNIA CAN SAY TO THE WORLD

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:20.270
IN THAT WE HAVE SAID TO THE

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:21.671
WORLD.

00:52:21.738 --> 00:52:23.440
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:25.141
IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP

00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:27.611
ECONOMIC GROWTH TO SEE BENEFITS

00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:29.813
FROM YOUR CLIMATE PROGRAM THAT

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.747
YOU CAN HAVE YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL.

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.916
AS IT WERE.

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:35.285
WE HAVE SEEN RIGHT ECONOMY GROW.

00:52:35.352 --> 00:52:36.253
DURING AND THAT WE'VE

00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:38.922
IMPLEMENTED.

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:39.523
SOME OF THESE POLICIES ARE NOT

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:40.156
BROKEN.

00:52:40.223 --> 00:52:41.992

CHANG TESTIFIED THAT THERE ARE

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.809
THREE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:07.477
STATE'S CAPITATE PROGRAM AND THE

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:09.546
CAPITA RATE PROGRAMS IN THE

IN EUROPE. AND SPECIFICALLY SHE

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.883
CITED THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:14.451
PRICE FLOOR WHICH IS INDEED

00:54:14.517 --> 00:54:15.485
DIFFERENT.

AND SHE SUGGESTED THAT HARM THE

00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:20.423
STATE OF CALIFORNIA RELIES ON

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.925
ACTUAL COVERED SECTOR COVERED

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:23.526
FACILITY MISSION STATED TO SET

00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:25.261
THE CAP UNLIKE WAS WHAT WAS DONE

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:26.830
FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE EUROPEAN

A SELF CORRECTING AUCTION

00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:31.134
MECHANISM AND I JUST WANNA POINT

00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:32.936
OUT. OF MISS CHENEY TESTIFIED

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:34.037
THAT THERE WERE ABOUT FORTY

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:35.372
MILLION TONS THAT WILL BE

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:36.806
REMOVED FROM THE ALLOWANCES THAT

00:54:36.873 --> 00:54:38.642
CAME FROM THE AUCTION COLLAPSE

00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:39.209
OF TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY

00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:40.644
SEVENTEEN.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:41.478
I'M NINETEEN YEARS ARE DISPARATE

00:54:41.544 --> 00:54:43.113
REPORT WE AGREE. THAT'S THE

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:44.447
MINIMUM NUMBER THE MAXIMUM

00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:45.715
NUMBER WE CALCULATED AROUND

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:47.117
SIXTY SIX MILLION.

00:54:47.183 --> 00:54:48.551
SO THERE'S A RELATIVELY MODEST

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:49.986
BALLPARK TWENTY FIVE MILLION

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:51.655
POSSIBLE INCREMENT.

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:53.790
IN OVER ALLOCATION REDUCTIONS.

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:54.891
IF MULTIPLE OPTIONS THIS YEAR

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:56.326
DON'T SELL OUT.

00:54:56.393 --> 00:54:58.128
NOW THAT'S A SMALL FRACTION OF

00:54:58.194 --> 00:54:59.329
THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION

00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:00.063
THAT FOR EXAMPLE CHRIS BUSH

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.398
ESTIMATES

00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:03.266
JUST ROUGHLY IN LINE WITH WHAT

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:03.933
OTHER INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS HAVE

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.535
POINTED OUT. TO JUST ONE RESPOND

00:55:05.602 --> 00:55:06.403
AS TO THIS PARTICULAR

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:07.504
DISTINCTION THERE'S NOT A LOT

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:08.938
THERE.

00:55:09.005 --> 00:55:10.140
I THINK THE KEY ISSUE AND I

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:11.141
WOULD LOVE TO ENGAGE IN HIS

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:12.542
CHIANG ON THIS QUESTION IS

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:13.877
WHETHER NOT YOU'VE ACTUALLY USED

00:55:13.943 --> 00:55:15.412
THE FIT A FACILITY LEVEL DATA

00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:17.380
PROJECT TO PROJECT THE CAPS.

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:19.182
SO AS YOU TESTIFIED WHEN AIR BE

00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:19.816
SET THE ORIGINAL CAPS IN TWENTY

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:20.950
TEN.

00:55:21.017 --> 00:55:22.252
EVERY VERY CAREFULLY SAID WE

00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:24.721
CANNOT LOOK AT BROAD SECTOR DATA

00:55:24.788 --> 00:55:26.122
TO SET THE CAPS WE MUST USE

00:55:26.189 --> 00:55:27.924
FACILITY LEVEL DATA INSTEAD.

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:29.325
AND THE ORIGINAL CAPS WERE SET

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:30.326
USING FACILITY LEVEL DATA AS YOU

00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:32.028
SUGGEST.

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:33.329
HOWEVER THE CALCULATIONS THAT

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:35.265
YOUR AGENCY RELEASED

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:37.500
AT LAST MONTH DO NOT DO THAT.

00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:38.568
AND YOU TESTIFIED THAT IN FACT

00:55:38.635 --> 00:55:40.336
THEY DO.

00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:41.371
AND THIS SEEMS TO BE INCREDIBLY

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:42.539
IMPORTANT POINT OF DIFFERENCE

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:44.240
BECAUSE THE ERROR THAT MY TEAM

00:55:44.307 --> 00:55:44.874
HAS IDENTIFIED. IS QUITE

00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:46.509
SIGNIFICANT.

00:55:46.576 --> 00:55:47.310
AND WE CHECKED THE PRIMARY

00:55:47.377 --> 00:55:48.845
SOURCES YOU USED

00:55:48.912 --> 00:55:49.979
SO I'D BETTER APPRECIATE YOUR

00:55:50.046 --> 00:55:52.282
CLARIFICATION. I WHEN YOU SAY

00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:53.717
THERE'S NO AARON CALCULATIONS

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:55.518
AS TO WHERE THAT COMES FROM.

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.253
S. CHURCH SO WITH THE WAY THAT

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.089
WE SAT THAT WAY THAT WE SET THE

00:55:59.155 --> 00:56:00.290
CAPS ALL TALK THIS WAY IT'S

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:02.025
EASIER. THAT WAY THAT WE THOUGHT

00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:03.426
THE CAPS POSTS TWENTY TWENTY

00:56:03.493 --> 00:56:05.762
BASICALLY RATCHETS DOWN THE CAPS

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:06.129
THAT WE SET UP.

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:08.098
TWENTY TWENTY.

00:56:08.164 --> 00:56:09.733
AND THIS IS DESCRIBED IN THE

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:12.335
RULE MAKING THAT WE DID IN

00:56:12.402 --> 00:56:14.003
TWENTY SIXTEEN TO SAT THE POST

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.772
TWENTY TWENTY CAPS

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:16.639
SO THEY'RE BASICALLY IT'S THE

00:56:16.706 --> 00:56:18.641
EXACT SAME METHODOLOGY AND WE

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:20.143
JUST RATCHETED DOWN SO IT'S

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.945
USING THE EXACT SAME METHODOLOGY

00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:23.780
THAT WE DID IN TWENTY TEN. FOR

00:56:23.847 --> 00:56:25.949
TO SET THAT THE. THAT PRE TWENTY

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:27.484
TWENTY CAPS IS WHAT WE USE FOR

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:32.789
THE POST TWENTY TWENTY CAPS.

00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:33.890
OKAY URGING PATTY WITH THE

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:35.391
AMERICAN CARBON REGISTRY.

00:56:35.458 --> 00:56:37.227
IDINA AND THINKING ABOUT THE

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:39.796
END DIAZ SAID PROJECT TYPES THAT

00:56:39.863 --> 00:56:40.797
REDUCE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:42.232
POLLUTANTS.

00:56:42.298 --> 00:56:43.566
AND THE FACT THAT WE USE A ONE

00:56:43.633 --> 00:56:46.102
HUNDRED YEAR TWP FOR OFFSETS

00:56:46.169 --> 00:56:48.304
ACCOUNTING PURPOSES FOR.

00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:49.839
JG COUNTY PERSON THE CAP AND

00:56:49.906 --> 00:56:51.207
TRADE PROGRAM FOR THOSE.

00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:53.209
AND YET THERE.

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:54.878
THE WARMING POTENTIAL OF THOSE

00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:56.946
IS ROUTE IS REALLY REALIZED

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:58.448
WITHIN MUCH SHORTER.

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:00.917
TIME FRAMES.

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:03.686
AND SO YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDING

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:04.821
THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO KICK

00:57:04.888 --> 00:57:06.623
TO COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES CO

00:57:06.689 --> 00:57:07.624
TWO REDUCTIONS ON HUNDRED YOUR

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.492
TIME SCALE.

00:57:09.559 --> 00:57:11.961
WITH METHANE ORDER PRODUCTIONS

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:13.229
AN HONOR TIMESCALE.

00:57:13.296 --> 00:57:14.898
BUT EARNED IF WE LOOK AT A

00:57:14.964 --> 00:57:16.232
MEANINGFUL TIME FRAME FRESNO

00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:18.067
CP'S IT'S IN OVERLOOKING A

00:57:18.134 --> 00:57:19.068
TWENTY YEARS WHERE WHERE WE HAVE

00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:22.438
A. MUCH HIGHER GWP FOR THOSE.

00:57:22.505 --> 00:57:23.940
SO I MEAN WHAT IT WOULD BE FAIR

00:57:24.007 --> 00:57:25.708
TO SAY THAT WE.

00:57:25.775 --> 00:57:27.443
EFFECTIVELY HAVE A NET.

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:28.344
CLIMATE BENEFIT.

00:57:28.411 --> 00:57:29.646
.

00:57:29.712 --> 00:57:31.915
BECAUSE WHERE.

00:57:31.981 --> 00:57:33.149
YOU KNOW COUNTING THE REDUCTIONS

00:57:33.216 --> 00:57:34.217
UNDER YOUR TIME SCALE BUT

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:35.852
REALIZING THE BENEFIT. ON A

00:57:35.919 --> 00:57:37.320
TWENTY YEAR TIME SKILL SO

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:39.255
RELEASED REALIZING MORE KIND OF

00:57:39.322 --> 00:57:40.590
BENEFITS AND WE'RE COUNTING FOR.

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:40.757
THE.

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.492
.

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:44.527
WITH THOSE REDUCTIONS IN A AND

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:45.662
WENT AND LEADING CLEAR I I THINK

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:46.296
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

00:57:46.362 --> 00:57:48.998
I. I THINK THAT THAT MIGHT BE ON

00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:51.167
A THAT MIGHT BE ONE WAY TO LOOK

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:53.736
AT IT I ALSO THINK THAT. I'M AS

00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:55.438
WERE THINKING THROUGH.

00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:57.173
MAKING SURE THAT WITHIN THE CAP

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.775
AND TRADE PROGRAM WE HAVE AN

00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:00.243
APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON IT'S

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.011
IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT ALL OF

00:58:02.078 --> 00:58:04.280
THE REDUCTIONS IN WITHIN THAT

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:04.614
PROGRAM FROM.

00:58:04.681 --> 00:58:07.350
BUT SINGLE.

00:58:07.417 --> 00:58:08.818
AT A SINGLE A GLOBAL WARMING

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:11.354
POTENTIAL PERIOD. AND SO YOU

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.089
KNOW I DID FOR THE COMMITTEES.

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:15.491
INFORMATION WHEN WE'D TO FOR

00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:16.659
EXAMPLE THE SHORTLY CLIMATE

00:58:16.726 --> 00:58:18.228
PUTTING PLAN WHEN DO WE DO

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:20.597
REGULATIONS THAT FOCUS ON. A

00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:22.432
METHANE LIKE OUR OIL AND GAS

00:58:22.498 --> 00:58:24.701
REGULATION THAT WE RECENTLY DID

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:26.636
WE ALWAYS SHOW ON THE SHORT

00:58:26.703 --> 00:58:27.937
LIVED CLIMATE BENEFITS ON THE

00:58:28.004 --> 00:58:28.938
TWENTY YEAR GLOBAL WARMING

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:31.040
POTENTIAL BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF

00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:32.442
THE BIG BENEFITS AS OF UP THOSE

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:34.644
REGULATIONS. IS THAT WE GET MORE

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:37.914
BANG FOR OUR BUCK AS IT WERE SO

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:39.616
AND THE ABILITY TO TAKE SOME OF

00:58:39.682 --> 00:58:40.617
THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:42.085
POLLUTANTS OUT OF THE AIR

00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:43.753
THEY'RE NOT. AND BECAUSE THEY

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:45.521
FALL OUT OF THAT IF YOU REDUCE

00:58:45.588 --> 00:58:47.423
FEWER OF THEM THEY FALL OUT OF

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:49.292
FEAR MORE QUICKLY SO YOU SEE A

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:51.261
BIGGER BENEFIT. ONTO THE

00:58:51.327 --> 00:58:53.496
ATMOSPHERE MORE QUICKLY SO I'M

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:54.664
ETHIC THAT MIGHT BE WHAT ONE WAY

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:55.965
TO LOOK AT IT BUT I DON'T THINK

00:58:56.032 --> 00:58:59.969
IT WOULD REALLY AFFECT HOW WE ON.

00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:03.206
CREDIT THINGS.

00:59:03.273 --> 00:59:04.474
I GOOD MORNING I'M WILL BEAR

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:05.375
WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG

00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:06.743
ASSOCIATION AND I WANT TO JUST

00:59:06.809 --> 00:59:08.645
KIND OF REACTING AND POSE A

00:59:08.711 --> 00:59:10.380
QUESTION RELATED TO YOUR. NOTE

00:59:10.446 --> 00:59:12.115
THAT YOU KNOW LOOKING FOR TWELVE

00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:13.249
YEARS TWENTY THIRTY THERE'S A

00:59:13.316 --> 00:59:14.684
LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AS FAR AS HOW

00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:16.452
WE MEET THE TARGET. AND GETTING

00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:18.721
THEIR BEING AS IMPORTANT AS HOW

00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:19.055
WE GET THERE.

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:20.556
.

00:59:20.623 --> 00:59:22.458
AS WE LOOK AT IT AND SAY YOU

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:24.127
KNOW THERE IS UNCERTAINTY BUT.

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:26.462
HOW DO YOU ENVISION? OUT THROUGH

00:59:26.529 --> 00:59:27.764
THIS PROCESS AND OTHER PROCESS

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:29.399
REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:30.433
CERTAINTY THAT TO THOSE ARE

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.168
QUALITY BENEFITS IN THE PUBLIC

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:33.937
HEALTH BENEFITS AS WE GO FORWARD.

00:59:34.003 --> 00:59:36.172
AYE WE LOOK AT AB SIX ONE SEVEN

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:36.739
ELSE IF ASSN THE THINGS YOU

00:59:36.806 --> 00:59:37.674
MENTION.

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:38.574
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BUT

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:39.409
JUST WONDER IF YOU HAVE ANY

00:59:39.475 --> 00:59:39.976
FURTHER THOUGHTS WITHIN THE

00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:41.511
CONTEXT OF.

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:42.946
THE COVENTRY DISCUSSION IN THAT

00:59:43.012 --> 00:59:44.414
UNCERTAINTY HOW WE GET TO THOSE.

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.649
CLEANER BENEFITS.

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:48.451
THANK YOU WELL. I THINK THAT AS

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:50.453
WE LOOK AT ANYTHING THAT WERE

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.055
PROJECTING OUT TWELVE YEARS INTO

00:59:52.121 --> 00:59:53.489
THE FUTURE THERE'S A LOT THAT WE

00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:54.590
DON'T KNOW THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:55.792
TWELVE YEARS OUT AND I THINK

00:59:55.858 --> 00:59:57.260
THAT THAT'S WHY THE TRACKING

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:58.995
PIECE OF IT IS SO CRITICAL. WE

00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:01.130
HAVE THIS PROCESS TO HAVE ANNUAL

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:03.166
UPDATES TO A ANNUALLY BE ABLE TO

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:04.600
LOOK AT OUR GREENHOUSE GAS

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:06.302
INVENTORY TO ANNUALLY REPORT TO

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:07.537
THIS COMMITTEE TO ANNUALLY

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:09.839
REPORT TO OUR BOARD. AND ONE OF

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:10.773
THE THINGS THAT.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.842
YOU KNOW IT I TALKED IN MY

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:15.078
TESTIMONY ABOUT HOW POSTS TWENTY

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:16.846
TWENTY WHERE WE SEE WE NEED TO

01:00:16.913 --> 01:00:18.681
DOUBLE THE RATE OF EMISSION

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:19.682
REDUCTIONS.

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:21.217
SO RIGHT NOW WE MIGHT BE

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.553
REDUCING EMISSIONS YOU KNOW THE

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:25.421
THE. PATH THAT WERE ON WE MIGHT

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:27.223
REDUCING EMISSIONS FIVE TO SIX

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.992
MILLION METRIC TONS.

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:31.127
A YEAR. POSTS TWENTY TWENTY WERE

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:32.261
LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE A

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:34.831
THIRTEEN MILLION METRIC TONS OF

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:37.033
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS A YEAR. AND

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.268
IT'S HARD TO SORT OF AND PUT

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:41.771
THAT INTO CONTEXT BUT YOU KNOW

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:43.272
ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT IS.

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:45.074
THE TOTAL EMISSIONS FROM ALL

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:46.209
FOOD PROCESSORS IN THE STATE OF

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:48.077
CALIFORNIA IS TWO MILLION METRIC

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:49.512
TONS A YEAR. SO IT'S A PRETTY

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:51.180
BIG REDUCTION OR ASKING FOR

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:53.149
EVERY YEAR. AND AS WE START

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.150
LOOKING AT.

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:55.918
AS WE START GETTING INTO POST

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.120
WHEN TWENTY IN OUR PROGRAMS

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:59.355
REALLY NEED TO START BITING AND.

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:01.758
I THINK EARLY ON IN THE EARLY

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:03.559
TWENTY TWENTIES IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:05.094
THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IF

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:06.696
WE'RE NOT SEEING A SUBSTANTIAL

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:08.731
INCREASE IN THE RATE OF EMISSION

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:09.465
REDUCTIONS.

01:01:09.532 --> 01:01:11.367
WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:12.702
BE ON TRACK THIS IS NOT

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:14.003
SOMETHING YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:14.904
NINE BURRITO OWN KNOW THERE'S A

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:16.839
PROBLEM. YOU'RE GONNA SEE ARE

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:18.241
FOR NAUGHT IF THE LINE ISN'T

01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:19.542
LIKE THIS AND IT'S MORE LIKE

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:21.444
THIS OR LIKE THIS OR EVEN WORSE

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:22.879
LIKE THIS.

01:01:22.945 --> 01:01:24.514
WE'RE GOING TO KNOWING GOING TO

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.115
BE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:29.685
FOR THAT.

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.020
BECAUSE THIS ONE AND MAYBE HAVE

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:32.622
A FINAL QUESTION AFTER THAT THAT

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:34.290
ANYONE ELSE ONCE LINED UP.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:35.291
THANK YOU TERRACE SIERRA.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:36.092
THINKING IS TRYING.

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.294
.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.829
I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE THE

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:41.097
ASSERTION YOU MADE A COUPLE OF

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:42.031
TIMES THAT.

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:44.634
THE COMMENTS TEND TO GROUP INTO.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.968
TWO CAMPS THOSE IN FAVOR OF

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.037
HIGHER PRICES AND LOWER PRICES

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:49.939
AND WHEN YOU ADDRESS THAT.

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:50.239
DISTINCTION.

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.574
.

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:52.642
I FOUND THAT AND.

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:54.744
SURPRISING.

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:54.977
BECAUSE.

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:57.180
.

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:59.782
YOU KNOW A ADDRESS THE THAT THE

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:01.484
BULK OF THE CONTENT OF MANY OF

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.452
THE COMMENTS THAT SAY THAT.

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:04.220
.

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:06.222
THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THE WAY

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:07.156
THE MARKET RULES MAY NOT

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:09.058
SUFFICIENTLY.

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:10.493
THE EXCUSE ME THE WAY THE

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.128
MARKET RULES ARE WRITTEN.

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:13.863
.

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:16.132
RISKS CREATING A MARKET THAT

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:16.732
MIGHT NOT.

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:18.334
INCENTIVIZE SUFFICIENT

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.803
REDUCTION SMITH MEET THE TARGETS.

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:23.339
I DID NOT SEE A TON OF COMMENTS

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:24.407
THAT SAID WE IS SPECIFICALLY

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.109
WANT HIGH PRICES I THINK MOST

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:26.843
PEOPLE WANT LOW PRICES.

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:28.578
THE QUESTION IS

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:30.113
WHETHER WE'RE CREATING A MARKET

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.013
THAT CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE THOSE

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.615
EMISSION REDUCTION.

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:34.417
AND THAT HAS ROOM IN THE MARKET

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:36.185
FOR THE PRICE DISCOVERY TO OCCUR

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.587
SO THAT INVESTMENTS OCCUR THAT

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:39.188
ACTUALLY CREATE THOSE REDUCTIONS.

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.623
RATHER THAN PURSUING LOW MARKET

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.158
PRICES POTENTIALLY AT THE

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:44.427
EXPENSE OF OTHER GOALS.

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:46.229
AND SO IT'S THE QUESTION IS IS

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.865
THERE ARM.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:49.799
THERE'S IMPLIED IN YOUR SLIDES I

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:51.501
THINK THAT.

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.002
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:55.304
MARKET PRODUCES LOW PRICES

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:56.806
ALWAYS LOW PRICES AS POSSIBLE.

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.808
OR HAS ROOM FOR PRICES TO.

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.977
.

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:02.712
TO RANGE ACROSS A WIDER RANGE.

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:04.914
.

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:06.015
THERE'S AN IMPLICATION THAT

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:06.782
THERE IS NO ENVIRONMENTAL

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:08.684
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW THAT SET

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.119
UP THAT THERE'S NO DISTINCTION

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:10.987
BETWEEN WHETHER WE HAVE THE

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:12.388
CLIMATOLOGISTS ARE NOT.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.856
AND I'M WONDERING IF THEY ARE BE

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:15.658
HAS ANALYZE THE DIFFERENT SETS

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.126
OF MARKET RULES TO SEE WHAT THE

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:18.261
EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:19.896
OUTCOMES WILL BE BECAUSE I THINK

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:21.430
THAT'S REALLY. THE MAIN THING

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:22.465
THAT A LOT OF FOLKS ARE ASKING

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:23.432
FOR PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:25.001
EVIDENCE.

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:26.169
THAT THE ROUTE COMBINATION OF

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:27.837
RULES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:29.839
ACTUALLY PRODUCES RESULTS THAT

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:30.473
ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SCOPING

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.441
PLAN.

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:34.610
SO THAT YOU KNOW I AM.

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:36.045
SIMPLIFYING THE KINDS OF

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:38.114
COMMENTS THAT WERE RECEIVING IN

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:40.483
THE PROCESS AND I WOULD SAY THAT.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.751
THERE ARE.

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:43.452
IT.

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:45.121
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE AND I I

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:46.989
THINK THAT WE HAVE MANY OF THE

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:49.659
SAME GOALS THAT WE WANT TO SEE.

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:50.793
A STEADY AND PREDICTABLE MARKET

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.662
PRICE

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:54.530
IF THE PRICE IS TOO LOW AS WE

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.532
SAW IN THE YEAR AND AS WE SAW

01:03:56.599 --> 01:03:58.668
AND REGGIE. AND YOU ARE NOT

01:03:58.734 --> 01:03:59.902
GOING TO SEE ENTITIES ACTUALLY

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:01.237
TAKING ACTION TO REDUCE

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:02.605
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS I THINK

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.574
THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.008
ON THE OTHER HAND WE DON'T WANT

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:07.977
TO HAVE PRICES BE HIGHER THAN

01:04:08.044 --> 01:04:09.478
THEY NEED TO BE TO GET THE

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:11.013
EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND I THINK

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.915
THAT THAT'S REALLY ONE OF. THE

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:14.250
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE AS WE GO

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:15.618
THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT'S

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:16.886
PARTLY WHY WE'RE GOING THROUGH

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:18.621
THIS RULE MAKING PROCESS AND

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.423
INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM A

SEEING NO ONE ELSE LINED UP FOR

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:30.600
ASKING QUESTIONS THAT.

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:31.867
YOU THINK YOU FOR THINKING A

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.135
TROOPER.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:34.370
AND THIS ONE KIND OF

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:35.972
UNCONVENTIONAL BUT YET I THINK

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:39.308
IMPORTANT TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.110

COMMITTEE. AND THEY RELATE TO

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:09.999
THE ISSUE OF CARBON OFFSETS AYE

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:11.100
WHICH YOU DISCUSSED A LITTLE IN

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:12.668
YOUR OPENING REMARKS.

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:13.536
THE FIRST ISSUE I JUST WANNA

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:14.904
RAISES A AS YOU KNOW MISTER

01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:16.105
GARCIA THREE NINETY EIGHT

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:17.740
SPECIFICALLY SETS NEW LIMITS ON

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.375
THE USE OF CARBON OFFSETS IN THE

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:21.243
POST TWENTY TWENTY MARKET PERIOD.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:22.311
SUCH THAT NO MORE THAN FOUR

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:23.212
PERCENT OF EMISSIONS IN THE

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:24.880
PROGRAM CAN BE SATISFIED BY

01:06:24.947 --> 01:06:26.549
OFFSETS IN THE YEARS TWENTY

01:06:26.615 --> 01:06:27.350
TWENTY ONE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.118
FIVE. AND THAT SIX PERCENT IN

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:30.386
THE YEARS TWENTY TWENTY SIX TO

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:31.687
TWENTY THIRTY. THINK IT'S

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:32.688
IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:34.023

INFORMALLY AT THE STAGE.

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:38.094
WOULD IN FACT APPLY THAT HIGHER

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.628
SIX PERCENT LIMIT TO THE BULK OF

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:40.496
THE MISSIONS OCCURRING IN THE

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:41.464
YEARS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.965
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE.

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:44.133
WE CALCULATE THAT THAT'S ABOUT

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.434
EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:46.902
ADDITIONAL OFFSET CREDITS IF

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:48.471
THAT LIMIT IS FULLY EXPLOITED. A

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:49.572
YOU SHOULD JUST BE AWARE OF THAT

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:50.606
IF THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH YOUR

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.408
VIEWS ON THE INTENTION OF THE

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:53.109
BILL.

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:54.910
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT AS

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:56.779
TO THE TOTAL OFFSET LIMITS.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:58.447
ARE THE SECOND OFFSETS ISSUE YOU

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:00.149
MENTIONED IS IS WITH ESPECT TO

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:01.350
DEFINING DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:03.319
BENEFITS AND I APPRECIATE. OF

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:04.520
BOTH THE BOARD'S DISCUSSION AS

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:05.388
WELL AS YOUR OWN INTEREST IN

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:06.088
THIS.

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:08.090
DEFINING THIS TERM AND DOING SO

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:09.125
IN A WAY THAT'S VERY CAREFUL AND

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:10.292
RESPECTS ALL THE LEGITIMATE

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:11.694
INTERESTS IN THE PROCESS WILL

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:13.362
TAKE TIME ON SHORE AND EFFORT.

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:14.230
BUT OWN EMPHASIZE FOR THE

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:15.731
COMMITTEE THAT THUS FAR THE

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:17.066
BOARD HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO RULE

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:18.667
OUT THE ARGUMENT THAT PROJECTS

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:19.935
CAN QUALIFY FOR DIRECT

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:21.137
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT ON THE

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:21.704
BASIS OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:23.539
EMISSIONS.

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:25.307
IF THEY ARE ABLE TO SO QUALIFY

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:26.942
EVERY PROJECT WILL QUALIFY AND

01:07:27.009 --> 01:07:28.811
THERE WILL BE NO LIMIT ON DIRECT

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:29.678
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS IN THE

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:31.680
PROGRAM. I HEARD MS CHEN TESTIFY

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:32.882
TO YOU THAT THE BOARD WILL NOT

01:07:32.948 --> 01:07:34.650
DELIVER A DEFINITION. THAT

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:35.985
RESULTS IN ALL PROJECTS

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:38.154
QUALIFYING. THAT'S CLOSE TO

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.522
SAYING THAT THAT THAT ARGUMENT

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:41.123
ABOUT GREENHOUSE GASES WON'T BE

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.690
ACCEPTED BUT IT'S STILL NOT

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:43.259
STATED. AND YOU SHOULD JUST BE

01:07:43.325 --> 01:07:44.593
AWARE OF THAT BECAUSE AGAIN IF

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.895
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE A

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:47.263
BASIS FOR PROVING THAT THE

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:48.697
PROVISION GOES AWAY AND THE

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:50.332
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW.

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:51.367
SO THE FINAL ISSUE I WANT TO

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:52.568
TALK ABOUT AND THIS IS WELL

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:53.602
SPEND THE BULK OF MY TIME IS

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:54.870
THIS QUESTION OF. OVER

01:07:54.937 --> 01:07:56.505
ALLOCATION AS IT'S PUT AN A. B.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:57.706
THREE NINETY EIGHT ALSO CALLED

01:07:57.773 --> 01:07:58.707
SOMETIMES OVERSUPPLY IN THE

01:07:58.774 --> 01:08:00.643
DISCUSSIONS.

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:02.845
NICK THE FIRST THING TO SAY

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.747
HERE IS IS THAT. UP CALIFORNIA

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:06.315
IS NOT UNIQUE IN EXPERIENCING

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:07.817
THIS PROBLEM AFFECT EVERY MAJOR

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:09.218
CARBON MARKET IN THE WORLD HAS

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:10.486
EXPERIENCED THIS EXACT SAME

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:12.254
PHENOMENON. POSSIBLY BECAUSE

01:08:12.321 --> 01:08:13.322
MOST OF THESE CARBON MARKETS

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:14.523
ROAD THROUGH THE RECESSION YOU

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:15.558
DISCUSSED EARLIER WHICH

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:17.226
EXOGENOUSLY CAUSED EMISSIONS TO

01:08:17.293 --> 01:08:18.360
FALL LOWER THAN WHEREVER THE

01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:20.062
PROGRAM CAPS WERE SET. PRIOR TO

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:21.597
THE MISSIONS UP PRIOR TO THAT TO

01:08:21.664 --> 01:08:23.299
THE RECESSION.

01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:24.567
AND THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:25.701
CALIFORNIA'S THAT BOTH OF THE

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:27.236
OTHER MAJOR MARKETS IN THE WORLD

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:28.537
BOTH THE NORTHEASTERN STATES

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.172
REGGIE CARBON MARKET AS WELL AS

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.141
THE EUROPEAN UNION CARBON MARKET.

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:33.642
HAVE BOTH IDENTIFIED THIS ISSUE

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:34.944
STUDIED IT AND IMPLEMENTED

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:36.378
PROGRAMMATIC REFORMS TO DEAL

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:37.780
WITH THE PROBLEM OF CLOUDS OVER

01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:39.682
ALLOCATION. EITHER BY REMOVING

01:08:39.748 --> 01:08:41.584
ALLOWANCES UP FRONT OR IN THE

01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:42.852
CASE OF BOTH MARKETS ALSO

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:44.386
REMOVING ALLOWANCES ON THE BASIS

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:45.788
OF TRACK INFORMATION.

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:47.089
AS THE BANK OF ALLOWANCES IN

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:48.757
PRIVATE HANDS GROWS THE SUPPLY

01:08:48.824 --> 01:08:50.359
OF ALLOWANCES GOES UP OR DOWN

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:50.993
DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THAT

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.328
BANK.

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:53.629
SO BOTH OF OUR OUR MOST

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:55.531
IMPORTANT APPEAR SYSTEMS IN THE

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:56.632
WORLD HAVE DEALT WITH THIS

01:08:56.699 --> 01:08:57.867
PROBLEM QUITE SUCCESSFULLY AND

01:08:57.933 --> 01:08:58.934
THERE'S NO TECHNICAL BARRIER TO

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:00.569
DOING THAT HERE.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:01.604
I THINK THE MAIN BARRIER

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:02.605
RELEASED TO HAVE AN HONEST

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:03.639
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NATURE OF

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.307
THIS PROBLEM.

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:07.543
AND WITH THAT I I I PROVIDED IN

01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:08.077
THE COMMITTEE.

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:09.812
BACKGROUND DOCUMENT REFUSE TO

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:11.380
REPORT THAT MY TEAM PUT OUT ON

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:12.815
THIS ISSUE. AND MISS CHIANG

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:14.483
TESTIFIED THIS MORNING THAT OUR

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:15.885
REPORT IS INCORRECT.

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:17.319
I WANT TO CLARIFY HOW THE THE

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:18.554
EXCHANGE I JUST HAD WITH MISS

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:19.622
CHIANG INFORMED WHAT I'M ABOUT

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:20.923
TO TELL YOU.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.625
I THINK WHAT SHE'S TELLING YOU

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:23.759
IS NOT ENTIRELY TRUE NICK IT'S

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:25.561
TECHNICALLY TRUE.

01:09:25.628 --> 01:09:26.862
BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY ADDRESS

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:28.364
THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CONCERNS WE

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:29.932
RAISED AND IF I COULD REFER YOU

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.367
MISTER GARCIA TO THE BACKGROUND

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:33.068
DOCUMENT OF THAT YOU HAVE THAT

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:35.004
THE YOUR COMMITTEE PREPARED.

01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:37.139
IN TABLE ONE ON PAGE THREE.

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:38.173
WALKS THROUGH SOME OF THE

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.241
CALCULATIONS SIMILAR TO THE

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:40.476
CALCULATIONS MY TEAMMATE NEAR

01:09:40.543 --> 01:09:42.177
ZERO PRESENTED.

01:09:42.244 --> 01:09:43.579
AND WHAT I HEARD MISS CHANG

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:46.015
TESTIFY IS THAT THE PROGRAM CAPS

01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:47.550
IN THE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM ARE

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:50.619
SET USING FACILITY LEVEL DATA.

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:52.721
AND THAT REFERS TO. A WHAT WOULD

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:54.857
BE THE FOURTH LINE WHERE IT SAYS

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:56.158
POST TWENTY TWENTY ALLOWANCES

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:58.160
WITHOUT RESERVE. AND IN BOTH OF

01:09:58.227 --> 01:09:59.828
THE CASES IN THAT TABLE THE

01:09:59.895 --> 01:10:01.163
NUMBER TWO FIVE THREE TWO WAS

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.731
IDENTIFIED THAT'S THE NUMBER OF

01:10:02.798 --> 01:10:04.133
ALLOWANCES THE BOARD PROJECTS IN

01:10:04.199 --> 01:10:05.201
THE POST TWENTY TWENTY PERIOD IN

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:06.702
THE CURRENT MARKET RULES.

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.237
MS CHANG TESTIFIED THAT THE

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:09.538
NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES IS SET

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:11.507
USING FACILITY LEVEL EMISSIONS

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:13.576
DATA. THAT IS TRUE.

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:15.778
THE ERROR WE IDENTIFIED HAS TO

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:16.378
DO WITH THE FIRST LINE IN THAT

01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:17.479
TABLE.

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:18.881
WHERE THE PROJECTED EMISSIONS IN

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:19.882
THE POST TWENTY TWENTY PERIOD

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:21.116
ARE BASED NOT ON FACILITY LEVEL

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:22.484
EMISSIONS

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:23.686
BUT ON THE EMISSIONS FROM THE

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:25.321
ENTIRE SECTORS THAT ARE COVERED

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:26.455
BY CAP AND TRADE WHICH INCLUDES

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:27.590
A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:28.591
EMISSIONS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:30.426
TO CAP AND TRADE?

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:32.227
THIS ERROR REMAINS AN ERROR AND

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:33.529
RESULTS IN THE PROBLEM WE

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:35.130
IDENTIFIED IN OUR WORK THAT

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:36.465
SHOWS THAT THE BOARDS ANALYSIS

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:37.433
ABOUT OVER ALLOCATION DOESN'T

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:39.201
HOLD ANY WATER.

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:41.203
THAT CONTINUES TO BE TRUE.

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.105
AND I CANNOT EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:44.306
OF THE BASIC SCIENTIFIC

01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:46.075
INTEGRITY QUESTION THIS'S WE

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:47.610
WENT STRAIGHT TO THE MODEL

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:48.978
OUTPUTS THAT THE BOARD SITES IN

01:10:49.044 --> 01:10:50.646
THE SCOPING PLAN. WE TRIPLE

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:52.348
CHECKED THE NUMBERS THE NUMBERS

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:53.983
MATCH WHAT ARE BE PUBLISHED AND

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:55.784
THEY ARE NOT FACILITY LEVEL

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:57.553
EMISSIONS DATA SO THE

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.054
CALCULATIONS THE BOARD PRESENTS.

01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:00.623
ARE IN FACT BASED ON SECTOR WIDE

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:02.358
EMISSIONS.

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.759
THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:04.994
CALCULATED REDUCTIONS IN THE

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.428
BOARD'S REPORT ATTRIBUTED TO THE

01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:07.863
CAPITA RATE PROGRAM ARE INFLATED

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.965
AS A RESULT OF THIS AIR.

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:10.866
AGAIN THIS IS JUST BASIC

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.901
ACCOUNTING.

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:14.837
I WANNA EMPHASIZE FURTHER THAT

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:16.005
THE QUESTION OF HOW TO DEAL WITH

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:17.606
OVER ALLOCATION IS A QUESTION OF

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:18.974
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE YEAR TWENTY

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:20.709
THIRTY THE YEAR OF S. B. THIRTY

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:21.343
TWOS BINDING STATEWIDE EMISSIONS

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:22.344
LIMITS.

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:23.178
AS LEN WHEN OTHERS HAVE

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:24.279
TESTIFIED

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:25.848
THE QUESTIONABLE REALLOCATION IS

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:26.649
A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:28.083
THESE EXTRA ALLOWANCES WILL

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:29.685
CAUSE THE STATE TO MISSION MISS

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:30.285
ITS EMISSIONS TARGETING TWENTY

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:31.387
THIRTY.

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:32.721
THE BOARD HAS NOT ANALYZE THE

01:11:32.788 --> 01:11:34.390
QUESTION OF WHAT OVER ALLOCATION

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:35.524
MY TO TO EMISSIONS IN THE YEAR

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:37.326
TWENTY THIRTY. THAT IS THE

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:39.261
SINGLE AND PRIMARY QUESTION THAT

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:41.263
IS STILL LEFT UNADDRESSED.

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:42.364
THIS DISCUSSION IS CHIANG AND I

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:43.766
HAD I'D BE DELIGHTED TO CONTINUE

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:44.299
THAT DISCUSSION WITH YOUR

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:45.434
PERMISSION.

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:47.636
IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:48.671
THE INFORMATION THE BOARD PUT

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:50.272
FORWARD TO SATISFY AB THREE

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:51.273
NINETY EIGHTS INSTRUCTION TO

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.042
STUDY THIS ISSUE PASSES A BASIC

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:54.677
SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY TEST.

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:56.311
IT DOES NOT IN MY OPINION.

SHARE SOME THOUGHTS HERE I WANT

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:30.546
TO START BY EMPHASIZING

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:32.314
SOMETHING IMPORTANT ABOUT MYSELF

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:32.815
AND THAT'S THAT I'M NOT

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:37.586
THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT I'M.

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:39.855
PARTICLE WORD IS IS RAISING

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:41.457
ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE THE ACCOUNTING

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:43.192
PROCEDURES.

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:44.626
A BUT I DO WANNA OTHER TAKE THIS

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:45.994
OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT THE

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:48.597
ROLE THAT YOUR COMMITTEE. CAN

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:51.800
PLAY AND PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OF

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.435
THE CAR PROCESS

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:54.603
I'M I SHOULD SAY THAT AS A

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.538
SCHOLAR OF.

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:58.407
I'M ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES EPA

01:12:58.474 --> 01:12:59.808
CAR BUT CETERA.

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.610
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:02.845
ME TO THINK ABOUT THE

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:04.613
APPROPRIATE ROLE THAT THE

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.081
LEGISLATURE AUTOPLAY VIS A VIS

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:07.883
AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY. THAT

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.485
IS DELEGATED THAT EXTRAORDINARY

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.053
AMOUNT OF POWER AND AUTHORITY.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.788
.

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:14.223
BY THE LEGISLATURE WHICH I THINK

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:15.390
IS PLACE A LOT OF TRUST IN CARP

01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:16.825
AT AND AT THE SAME TIME

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:18.994
CONTINUING TO PLAY AN ONGOING

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:19.528
ROLE THAT I THINK IT'S AN

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:20.596
IMPORTANT ONE AND SO.

01:13:20.662 --> 01:13:21.797
PART OF WHAT I WANNA DO IS JUST

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:22.965
COME AND THAT THE.

01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:24.333
LEGISLATURE FOR ACTUALLY

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:25.534
THINKING HARD ABOUT THAT

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:27.002
APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.537
TWO AGENCIES AND THEN. SAY

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:30.172
SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:31.807
THIS COMMITTEE MIGHT THINK ABOUT

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:33.342
THE OVER ALLOCATION PROBLEM FROM

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:34.476
AN OVERSIGHT PERSPECTIVE AS

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:35.644
OPPOSED TO REALLY TECHNICAL KIND

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:37.479
OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE.

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:39.948
SO I'M SO THIS IS REALLY FOR FOR

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.250
ME AND SINCE SOME RESPECT TO ADD

01:13:41.316 --> 01:13:42.684
EXERCISE AND FRAMING HOW TO

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:45.187
THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE. BECAUSE

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:45.354
AS.

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.488
.

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:47.256
MS CHANG SAID I THINK

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:49.124
APPROPRIATELY THIS IS A LONG

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:51.693
TERM ISSUE WITH A LONG TAIL

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.262
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE COMPLETE

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:55.030
INFORMATION. AND MORE

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.832
INFORMATION WILL COME GOING

01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:58.634
FORWARD AND ONE THING THE

01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.802
COMMITTEE MIGHT THINK ABOUT IS

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:00.836
HAVE STRUCTURE SOME OF THE

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:02.104
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.672
INFORMATION IS NECESSARY. AND I

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.174
THINK THAT THINK ABOUT THAT IT

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.776
IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO STEP BACK

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:08.310
AND THINK ABOUT SOME FIRST

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:09.378
PRINCIPLES.

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:11.513
AND AT BY THAT WHAT I MEAN IS I

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.848
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THINK ABOUT

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:14.316
THE GOALS THAT.

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:17.085
AB THIRTY TWO AND SB THIRTY TWO

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:19.788
AND AND SO FORTH HAVE SET IN

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:21.623
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. DEEP

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:22.958
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:24.760
REDUCTIONS AND THINK ABOUT

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.962
WHETHER SOLUTIONS TO THE OVER

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:28.063
ALLOCATION PROBLEM ARE

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:29.364
CONSISTENT WITH THOSE SCHOOLS

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:31.166
AND ALSO TO RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:31.767
SCHOOLS CAN BE ATTENTION WITH

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.235
ONE ANOTHER. AND SO GETTING

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.504
INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER THOSE

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:36.738
SCHOOLS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.907
ACCOMPLISHED SEEMS TO ME TO BE

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:39.441
AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR YOUR

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:40.409
COMMITTEE TO PLAY.

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:42.144
SO LET ME JUST EXPLICATE SOME OF

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:44.079
THOSE SCHOOLS PEOPLE MAY THINK

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.547
THERE ARE OTHERS BUT ALL PUT A

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:47.182
FEW IN FRONT OF YOU. AND THE

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:48.250
TALK ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.351
THOSE SCHOOLS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:50.319
IN TOUCH WITH EACH OTHER AND THE

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:51.620
KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:52.321
MIGHT ASK TO GET MORE

01:14:52.387 --> 01:14:54.122
INFORMATION. SO THAT YOU CAN

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:55.958
PROVIDE APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE TO

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:57.059
CARVE ABOUT WHICH SCHOOLS ARE

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:59.228
MORE IMPORTANT HOW TO BALANCE

01:14:59.294 --> 01:14:59.828
THE COMPETING INTERESTS AND SO

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:01.263
FORTH.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:04.399
SO IN MY VIEW M. AND THAT THE IT.

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:05.934
A DECENT AMOUNT OF THIS FROM THE

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:08.403
LEGISLATION LEGISLATIVE HISTORY.

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:11.039
OF THE GOALS OF ANY SOLUTION TO

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:12.007
THE OVER ALLOCATION PROBLEM

01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:13.408
THAT'S ASSUMING THERE ISN'T OVER

01:15:13.475 --> 01:15:15.277
ALLOCATION PROBLEM ASSUMING IT'S

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.011
A SERIOUS ONE.

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:19.381
SEEM TO ME TO BE M. MAYBE IN

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:20.415
THIS ORDER ALTHOUGH YOU COULD

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:22.317
QUIBBLE WITH MY ORDER FIRST TO

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:23.352
ACHIEVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:24.987
OUTCOME AND THAT IS THE BINDING

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:25.721
GOAL SET.

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:27.623
FOR BY ON.

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:29.825
LEGISLATION TO CUT GREENHOUSE

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:31.193
GAS EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.728
UP BY FORTY PERCENT OR NINETEEN

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:34.963
NINETY LEVELS AND IMPORTANTLY

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:37.032
ALSO TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER. AS

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:38.166
MISS CHANG SUGGESTED THAT ALSO

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:40.235
GETS US ON THE TRAJECTORY A

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:41.703
TRAJECTORY THAT DOESN'T END IN

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:43.272
TWENTY THIRTY BUT THAT ENDS MID

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:45.574
CENTURY OR MAYBE NEVER ENDS. AND

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.242
THAT IS uDEEPLY

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:48.510
THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND SO I

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:49.444
THINK WE SHOULD KEEP.

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:50.979
THAT LONGER TERM GOAL IN MIND AS

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:53.482
WELL BECAUSE IT MAY BE THAT THE

01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:54.683
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF THE

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:55.684
OVER ALLOCATION PROBLEM SHOULD

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:57.719
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT

01:15:57.786 --> 01:15:58.987
WERE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:00.756
REGULATE POST TWENTY THIRTY.

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:02.457
I'M SO ACHIEVING ENVIRONMENTAL

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:03.792
OUTCOMES HE'S TO ME TO BE A.

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:05.560
PRIMARY PRINCIPLE MAYBE THE MOST

01:16:05.627 --> 01:16:07.930
IMPORTANT GOAL BUT SIMILARLY

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:09.364
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT DO SO COST

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:11.533
EFFECTIVELY THAT'S. THAT'S OF

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.301
REPLETE THROUGHOUT THE

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:13.869
LEGISLATION IT'S ALSO SOMETHING

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:15.304
I THINK KNOWN WOULD QUIBBLE WITH

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.305
THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:17.873
OUT HOW TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT.

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.274
HELPS GROW THE ECONOMY THAT

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:22.110
MAINTAINS PRICES FOR THINGS LIKE

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:24.012
FUEL AND ELECTRICITY AT AND AT A

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:26.281
RATE THAT CONSUMERS CAN AFFORD.

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:27.282
WE WANT TO BE PARTICULARLY

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:28.583
CONCERNED ABOUT DISTRIBUTIONAL

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:29.952
CONSEQUENCES FROM LOW INCOME

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:31.553
CONSUMERS WE SOMETIMES TALK

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.888
ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ON

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:34.022
THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE I THINK

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:35.190
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.525
MIND THAT. THE ECONOMIC

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:38.360
CONSEQUENCES THAT HIGHER LEVELS

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.429
PRICES FOR EXAMPLE COULD HAVE ON

01:16:40.495 --> 01:16:42.064
THINGS LIKE GASOLINE. I'M I

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:43.899
THINK WE ALSO WANT.

01:16:43.966 --> 01:16:45.767
AND THIS IS PROBABLY A A LESSER

01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:47.336
GOAL BUT ONE THAT MIGHT BE WORTH

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.504
KEEPING IN MIND. A PREDICTABLE

01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:52.708
RELIABLE REVENUE STREAM FROM THE.

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:55.610
AUCTION OF ALLOWANCES I'M I

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:57.713
KNOW THAT RAISING REVENUE IS NOT

01:16:57.779 --> 01:16:58.981
THE PRINCIPAL FOCUS OF THE.

01:16:59.047 --> 01:17:01.316
OF THE PROGRAM BUT IT IS

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:03.185
HELPFUL TO HAVE STEADY OF BURKE

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:04.920
PREDICTABLE REVENUE THAT HELPS

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:05.821
BUDGET AND SO FORTH AND OF

01:17:05.887 --> 01:17:07.422
COURSE THAT REVENUE HAS PAID FOR

01:17:07.489 --> 01:17:09.224
SOME REALLY IMPORTANT. PROGRAMS

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:10.192
AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:12.127
SO WHY FORWARD MY PERSONAL

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:13.762
FAVORITE IS CLEANING UP THE

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:14.830
TRANSPORTATION FLEET WHICH I

01:17:14.896 --> 01:17:16.231
THINK ISTHE SINGLE BIGGEST

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:17.232
PROBLEM FOR.

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:19.468
FOR.

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:21.036
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:23.405
FOR AIR POLLUTION PROBLEMS THAT

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:24.306
WE CONTINUE TO FACE.

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:25.540
I THINK ANOTHER GOAL IS TO TRY

01:17:25.607 --> 01:17:27.576
TO MAKE TRANSITIONS FOR EXAMPLE

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:29.678
INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY. PERIOD.

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:32.247
STABLE AND TO LIMIT VOLATILITY

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:34.649
AND AND PRICES THAT SUPPORT FOR

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:36.151
CONSUMERS IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:38.653
FOR THE REGULATED PARTIES AND

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.621
THAT FINALLY THIS MIGHT SEEM

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:41.023
LIKE A WEIRD GOAL BUT I THINK

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:42.057
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:43.392
IS. THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.394
MAINTAIN POLITICAL STABILITY FOR

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:46.828
THE PROGRAM AND ONE OF THE GREAT

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:48.730
HALLMARKS TO ME. OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:50.966
CLIMATE POLICIES IS THAT WE HAVE

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:52.734
MAINTAINED VERY STRONG PUBLIC

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:54.603
SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM WE'VE

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:55.937
MAINTAINED. A FAIR AMOUNT OF

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:57.672
SUPPORT BY A LOT OF REGULATED

01:17:57.739 --> 01:17:58.874
PARTIES AND I THINK THAT'S IN

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.208
PART BECAUSE WE'VE DONE A VERY

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:01.843
GOOD JOB OF REDUCING EMISSIONS

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.412
ARE COST EFFECTIVE PRICES. AND

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:05.414
SO KEEPING THAT GOAL IN MIND

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.748
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT.

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.283
TRY TO SOLVE THE OVER

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:09.785
ALLOCATION PROBLEM SEEMS TO ME

01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:11.820
TO BE IMPORTANT IT'S I JUST

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:13.622
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT.

01:18:13.688 --> 01:18:15.891
THAT DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS THAT

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:16.725
HAVE BEEN PROPOSED I DON'T I

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:17.559
DON'T I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY NOT

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:18.627
OF THE STAGE AT TO ACTUALLY

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:19.161
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:20.495
SOLUTION IS A BIG WE NEED MORE

01:18:20.562 --> 01:18:22.064
INFORMATION. BUT THE DIFFERENT

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:24.633
SOLUTIONS COMPOSED REAL TENSIONS

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:25.400
BETWEEN THOSE SCHOOLS

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:27.402
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WERE TO SAY

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:29.137
LET'S DO NOTHING ABOUT THE OVER

01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:30.705
ALLOCATION PROBLEM ASSUMING THAT.

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:31.706
IT EXISTS AND IT'S PRETTY

01:18:31.773 --> 01:18:33.909
SERIOUS WE COULD MISS THE TWENTY

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:35.544
THIRTY GOAL BY TEN OR TWENTY OR

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:36.445
EVEN THIRTY PERCENT TO SOME

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:36.745
PROJECTIONS

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:39.081
CHEST.

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:40.315
BUT THE COSTS WOULD BE LOW. BY

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.350
WAY OF HAVE MUCH LOWER COST

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:43.852
BY THE SAME TOKEN IF WE SIMPLY

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:46.421
CUT OFF A HUGE NUMBER OF. A PRE

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:48.156
TWENTY TWENTY ALLOWANCES THAT

01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:49.825
BEEN BANKED AND SO FORTH WE

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:50.826
MIGHT MEET THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:51.393
GOAL THAT WE MIGHT SEE PRICE

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.595
SPIKES.

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:55.597
AND AGAIN TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT.

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:57.499
BY HOW MUCH IT CETERA SEEMS TO

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:59.101
ME TO BE AN IMPORTANT GOAL FOR

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:00.735
THIS COMMITTEE AND. A AND WOULD

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:02.237
BE A GOOD WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:04.139
INTERACTIONS WITH CARBON SEEKING

01:19:04.206 --> 01:19:05.841
INFORMATION FROM CARP ABOUT. THE

01:19:05.907 --> 01:19:06.808
TRADE OFFS.

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:09.411
BETWEEN THOSE TWO GOALS AND OF

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:10.545
COURSE SOME OTHER ONES HOW

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:13.715
VOLATILE PRICES BE IF WE AND

01:19:13.782 --> 01:19:15.584
ADOPT A PARTICULAR SOLUTION.

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.085
ARE WE LIKELY TO USE LIVES

01:19:17.152 --> 01:19:18.420
POLITICAL SUPPORT ARE WE LIKELY

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:21.490
TO SEE BIG PRICE SPIKES IN FUEL

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:22.691
PRICES ARE ELECTRICITY AND SO

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:25.127
FORTH. AND SO I'M SO FOR ME AND

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:26.328
TRY TO EVALUATE THESE PROPOSALS

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:27.429
I THINK OF BE HELPFUL TO GET

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:29.197
MORE INFORMATION FRAMED AROUND

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:30.799
THESE SCHOOLS AND AGAIN I THINK

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:32.934
THAT MIGHT BE. A WAY FOR

01:19:33.001 --> 01:19:34.870
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT TO PROCEED

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:36.571
GOING FORWARD AS.

01:19:36.638 --> 01:19:37.739
CARD COMES OUT WITH A PROPOSAL

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:39.307
IN IS VERY STAKEHOLDERS RESPOND

01:19:39.374 --> 01:19:40.275
TO THAT PROPOSAL.

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:42.244
I'M.

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:43.512
LET ME NOW JUST MOVE ON TO THE

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:44.579
QUESTION OF DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:46.982
BENEFITS I I AGREE WITH.

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:50.318
OF DR COHN WORD THAT TIME.

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:52.020
WE CANNOT MEASURE DIRECTIVE ARE

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.221
NOT A BENEFIT SIMPLY BY SAYING

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:54.623
THE REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES I

01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:55.924
THINK THAT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE

01:19:55.991 --> 01:19:57.792
OF THE LEGISLATION. AND SO IT

01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:59.327
WOULD BE HELPFUL I THINK TO

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:00.996
CLARIFY THAT PARTICULAR POINT.

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:02.764
THE ONLY OTHER THING I'LL SAY IS

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:04.466
I I THINK I'D BE REMISS AS A.

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:06.635
LAW PROFESSOR IF I DIDN'T RAISE

01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:07.669
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY'RE

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:10.172
CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS WITH.

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:11.640
THE WAY THAT THE LEGISLATION

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:13.074
READS RIGHT NOW I THINK THERE

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:14.843
IT'S AT LEAST WORTH A DEEPER

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.144
ANALYSIS OF WHETHER THEY'RE

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:17.712
COMMERCE CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:19.981
SINGLING OUT CALIFORNIA TO HAVE

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:21.616
DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS

01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:22.350
THINK IT'S ACTUALLY COMPLICATED

01:20:22.417 --> 01:20:24.052
QUESTION. I THINK THE.

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:25.520
NINTH CIRCUIT'S RULING ON THE

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:26.855
LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD GIVES.

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:28.957
SOME HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATION

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:29.691
WOULD ACTUALLY BE OF HELP BUT I

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:31.059
THINK PROBABLY DESERVES MORE

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:32.594
ANALYSIS AND. HONEST IS WORTH

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:33.261
SAVING.

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:38.166
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:39.234
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RICH

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:41.203
ROSS BROWN WITH THE LA THOUGH.

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:43.438
I THINK I'D LIKE TO JUST BEGAN

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:44.539
MY COMMENTS JUST.

01:20:44.606 --> 01:20:46.208
FIRST SORT OF STATING I THINK

01:20:46.274 --> 01:20:47.609
THAT GENERALLY OUR OFFICE HAS

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.177
BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF CARBON

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:50.412
PRICING AND CAP AND TRADE IN

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:52.314
PARTICULAR AS A. TOOL TO ACHIEVE

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.481
THE STATE'S AGGRESSIVE

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:55.050
GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS AND

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:56.384
RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE

01:20:56.451 --> 01:20:57.719
EXTENDED PROGRAM.

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:58.720
LAST YEAR BECAUSE WE DO THINK

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:00.088
IT'S THE ONE OF THE MOST COST

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:01.289
EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO ACHIEVE THOSE

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:02.724
GOALS IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:03.825
IMPORTANT GIVEN THE AMBITION OF

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:06.661
THE. OF THIS LEGISLATURE'S GOALS.

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:08.363
HOWEVER IT IS AN EXTREMELY

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:10.498
COMPLICATED PROGRAM AND IT'S

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:11.600
IMPORTANT TO GETS.

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.468
THE DESIGN FEATURES RIGHT AND

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:14.736
BALANCE ALL THE DIFFERENT TRADE

01:21:14.803 --> 01:21:15.637
OFFS IN THOSE DESIGN FEATURES

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.772
AND SO. WHAT WE THINK OVERSIGHT

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:19.407
AND HEARINGS LIKE THIS ARE ARE

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:19.941
IMPORTANT?

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:21.509
FOR FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:22.544
PERSPECTIVE.

ALSO JUST WENT OUT WE RELEASED

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:26.581

HIGHLIGHTING SOME OVERSIGHT

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:28.383
ISSUES AND.

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:29.818
SOME OF THOSE ARE DISCUSSED AND

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:31.186
AND THE HEARING STAY ON THE

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:32.621
TOPIC OF OF THE HEARING TODAY WE

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:42.731
ISSUES THAT WE HIGHLIGHT IN THE

01:21:42.797 --> 01:21:44.165
LAST FEW PAGES OF THOSE HAND OUT.

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:46.268
THE FIRST TO THE ISSUE OF OVER

01:21:46.334 --> 01:21:48.403
ALLOCATION AND JUST MORE BROADLY

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:51.306
SETTING CAPS AND OTHER SUPPLY OF

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:52.240
ALLOWANCES.

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:53.708
THE POST TWENTY TWENTY PROGRAM

01:21:53.775 --> 01:21:55.543
ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY A VERY

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:56.911
IMPORTANT ISSUE FROM AN

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:58.947
ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE.

01:21:59.014 --> 01:21:59.281
AND.

01:21:59.347 --> 01:22:00.982
YOU JUST ASK THE QUESTION ARE

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:02.083
CAPS THAT IN A WAY THAT'S

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:03.184
CONSISTENT WITH THE

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:04.552
LEGISLATURE'S TWENTY THIRTY GOAL

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:06.087
IS THE PROGRAM GENERALLY SET UP

01:22:06.154 --> 01:22:07.355
IN A WAY. THAT'S LIKELY TO

01:22:07.422 --> 01:22:08.757
ACHIEVE THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.425
GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS.

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:12.227
IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:14.095
GIVEN THAT AND THE SCOPING PLAN

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:15.730
CAP AND TRADE IS IDENTIFIED AS

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:16.831
SORT OF THE TOOL THAT WILL

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:18.533
ENSURE THE STATE MEETS THOSE

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.267
GOALS.

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:21.069
WHAT OTHER POLICIES ARE ABLE TO

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.237
ACHIEVE CAP AND TRADE WILL MAKE

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:23.305
UP THE DIFFERENCE SO IT'S PRETTY

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:25.073
GOOD IMPORTANT TO DEMONSTRATE

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.675
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY SET UP IN A

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:28.543
WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL?

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:30.512
AND ARE DECEMBER REPORT THAT I

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:31.980
MENTIONED WE LAID OUT.

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:35.317
ONE PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO WHERE

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:36.351
JUST GIVEN THE STRUCTURE OF THE

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:37.719
PROGRAM WITH BANKING AND

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.020
POTENTIALLY WITH SOME UNUSED

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:40.588
ALLOWANCES CARRIED OVER IN THE

01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:42.290
TWENTY TWENTY PROGRAM. YOU GET

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:43.458
THE STATE DEFINED ITSELF IN A

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:45.660
SITUATION WHERE IT MEETS THE

01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:47.195
SORT OF CUMULATIVE EMISSION

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:48.930
REDUCTION OUR MISSION GOALS BUT

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:50.832
DOESN'T NEED ITS ANNUAL TWENTY

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:52.567
THIRTY TARGET THAT'S THE THAT'S

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:54.369
LAID OUT IN STATUTE AND SO. I

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:55.670
THINK THAT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:57.439
ISSUE TO EXAMINE US KIND OF IS

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:58.873
THE IS THE PROGRAM GONNA GONNA

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.075
PUT THE STATE ON TRACK TO

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:01.910
ACHIEVE ITS ANNUAL TWENTY THIRTY

01:23:01.976 --> 01:23:02.610
GOAL.

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:04.746
DESPITE THIS POSSIBILITY OUR

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:07.382
CARBON ITS INITIAL WORKSHOPS

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:08.616
HAS NOT IN OUR VIEW DEMONSTRATED

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:10.185
OR EXPLAINS.

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:11.853
HOW THE PROGRAM IS LIKELY TO

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.022
ACHIEVE THAT TWENTY THIRTY GOAL

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:15.357
AND PUT THE STATE ON TRACK TO

01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:16.024
ACHIEVE THAT TWENTY THIRTY

01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:16.958
TARGET?

01:23:17.025 --> 01:23:18.426
THEY HAVE DONE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:20.195
ANALYSIS AT THE AS YOU'VE HEARD

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:21.396
LOOKING AT.

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:23.064
I ESTIMATED CUMULATIVE EMISSIONS

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:24.599
AND KIM WOULD HAVE REDUCTIONS

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:26.234
AND THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION THAT

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.336
DR ARTICLE IN WORD MENTIONED.

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:30.205
WE DO SHARE SORT OF SOME OF THE

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:31.539
CONCERNS AROUND.

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:33.041
THE ANALYSIS OF KEY MODE OF THE

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:34.242
NATION'S INCOME HOW THAT THAT

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:36.077
PROGRAM WOULD WOULD REDUCE THOSE.

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:37.379
.

01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:38.546
BUT DATE I THINK THE MORE

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:39.781
IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT THERE IS

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:40.949
STILL HAS NOT REALLY BEEN AN

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:42.884
EXPLANATION OF EXACTLY. HOW THE

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:44.753
BOARD ENVISIONS THE PROGRAM?

01:23:44.819 --> 01:23:46.588
AS GONNA PUT IN THE STATE ON

01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:47.789
TRACK TO ACHIEVE ITS TWENTY

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:48.556
THIRTY GOALS.

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:51.426
.

01:23:51.493 --> 01:23:52.727
SO THEY THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:53.695
MIGHT WANT TO.

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:56.998
DIRECTS A CARP TO REPORT ON HOW

01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:58.800
THE PROGRAM IS LIKELY TO DO THIS.

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:00.502
EVALUATE AND THEN EVALUATE

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:06.841
DIFFERENT BE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. AT THE

01:24:06.908 --> 01:24:07.942
VERY LEAST.

01:24:08.009 --> 01:24:10.078
I THINK SO ONE OF THE POINTS

01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:11.146
THAT WAS MADE EARLIER.

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:12.147
BY MISS CARLSON.

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:14.315
ESTABLISH SOME CRITERIA.

01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:16.785
AND AND SERVE DATA COLLECTION

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:18.153
TO SORT OF OUTLINE IF NO

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:19.687
ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE NOW AT

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:21.089
LEAST IN THE FUTURE WHAT ARE THE

01:24:21.156 --> 01:24:21.656
CRITERIA THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.558
USED TO EVALUATE. WHEN THIS IS A

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:25.026
PROBLEM IF AND IF IT IS A

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:26.361
PROBLEM WHAT ARE THE LIKELY

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:28.196
STEPS THAT THE STATE'S GONNA

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:29.964
TAKE TO TO ADDRESS IT.

01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:31.366
THEIR VARIETY OF OPTIONS THAT

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:32.333
THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN THE STATE

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.401
HOUSE IN FRONT OF IT RIGHT NOW

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:33.835
TO.

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:35.703
DEAL WITH THE POTENTIAL OVER

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:38.173
SUPPLY PROBLEM INCLUDING MOVING

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:39.774
SOME ALLOWANCES EITHER TO THE

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:41.409
PRICE CEILING OR MAYBE A MORE

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:42.944
MODEST APPROACHES.

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:44.212
MOVING SOME TO SOME OF THE.

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:45.413
SPEED BUMPS AT SOME OF THE

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.048
LOWER PRICES.

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:49.250
THERE I THINK THE MAIN PUSHED

01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:50.518
BACK TO SOME OF THESE CHANGES.

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:52.554
WHICH IS FAIR IS THAT IT IT NOW

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:52.987
IT HAS.

01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:54.689
PUTS UPWARD PRESSURE PRESSURE

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.458
ON PRICES AND COSTS.

01:24:56.524 --> 01:24:58.092
AND SO THERE IS DEFINITELY A

01:24:58.159 --> 01:24:59.794
VERY CLEAR TRADE OFTEN AND

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:00.728
MAKING SOME OF THOSE ACTIONS AND

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:01.830
MAKING SOME OF THOSE CHANGES.

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:03.665
ARE BUT JUST A COUPLE POINTS ON

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:04.566
THAT ONE.

01:25:04.632 --> 01:25:06.568
EVEN UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:08.503
UNDER KIND OF THE CURRENT CAPS

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:09.170
MORE THAT'S OF SUPPLIED

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:11.706
ALLOWANCES IT IS. THERE'S STILL

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:12.774
A.

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:14.008
SIGNIFICANT REST THE PRICES

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:16.478
COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:17.145
EVEN CUT NOW IT SO THERE'S JUST

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:18.213
A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:19.614
PRICES REGARDLESS OF WHAT

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:20.682
ADJUSTMENTS MIGHT BE MADE.

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:23.418
IN RESPONSE TO WHATEVER OVER

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:24.085
SUPPLY ISSUE MIGHT BE OUT THERE.

01:25:24.152 --> 01:25:26.387
.

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:27.989
I THINK MAYBE THE MORE IMPORTANT

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:29.190
POINT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS

01:25:29.257 --> 01:25:30.191
THAT IT'S THE QUESTIONS AROUND

01:25:30.258 --> 01:25:31.426
STE

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:32.961
SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCE IS AN

01:25:33.027 --> 01:25:33.928
OVERSUPPLY AND WHERE TO SET THE

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.663
CAPS.

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:36.831
ARE REALLY IN OUR VIEW SHOULD BE

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:38.867
DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE IN THE

01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:40.068
STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:41.469
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S CONSISTENT

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:42.203
WITH THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:43.972
GOALS. THEIR FAIR CONCERNS

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:44.906
AROUND.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:46.608
COSTS AND TRADE OFFS RELATED TO

01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:48.276
COSTS

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:48.910
HOWEVER THAT THE PROGRAM DOES

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.178
HAVE OTHER FEATURES THAT ARE

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:51.813
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO TRY TO

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:52.814
MITIGATE AGAINST SOME OF THOSE

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:54.315
RISKS FOR EXAMPLE AB THREE

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:55.450
NINETY EIGHT.

01:25:55.517 --> 01:25:57.051
DIRECTOR CARP TO ESTABLISH A

01:25:57.118 --> 01:25:58.920
PRICE CEILING AND THE GOLD THAT

01:25:58.987 --> 01:25:59.854
PRICE CEILING HAS TO DEAL WITH

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:02.190
THAT THE THE SPECIFIC RISK OR

01:26:02.257 --> 01:26:03.658
CONCERNED ABOUT PRICES AND COST

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:05.159
GETTING TOO HIGH AND SO. TO THE

01:26:05.226 --> 01:26:06.995
EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:26:07.061 --> 01:26:07.595
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND YOU

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:08.463
KNOW IT WENT TO I THINK LOOK

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:10.565
VERY CLOSELY AT. OUR ENSURING

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:11.466
CAR BESETTING THE LEVEL THAT

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:12.333
PRICE HILL IN THE WAY THAT'S

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.434
CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:15.904
LEGISLATURE BALANCES ITS GOALS

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:17.639
ARE BETWEEN VARMINT GOALS AND

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:18.540
ALSO.

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:22.010
MAINTAINING COSTS AT A

01:26:22.076 --> 01:26:22.410
REASONABLE LEVEL.

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:23.378
.

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:25.813
FINALLY JUST VERY QUICKLY ON THE

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.481
OFFSETS ISSUE I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:28.416
I HAVE MUCH TO ADD BEYOND WHAT

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:30.151
HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID. OTHER

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:31.586
THAN I THINK JUST ALSO THE

01:26:31.653 --> 01:26:32.353
HIGHLIGHTS.

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.522
YOU KNOW THAT IT APPEARS BASED

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:36.124
ON SOME STAFF COMMENTS IN

01:26:36.190 --> 01:26:37.392
WORKSHOPS THAT THERE WERE SOME

01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:38.826
CONSIDERATION OF ALLOWING A

01:26:38.893 --> 01:26:40.695
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. AS

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:41.963
COUNTY NOW HAS A DIRECT

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.798
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT AYE I

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:45.466
THINK YOU KNOW THAT THAT CLEARLY

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:46.467
WOULD SORT OF FLATTENED MAKE

01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:47.735
OFFSET PROJECTS POTENTIALLY

01:26:47.802 --> 01:26:49.904
QUALIFY. AND THAT DOES SEEM TO

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:52.373
BE INCONSISTENT IF IT WERE TO BE

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:52.974
IMPLEMENTED THAT WAY THAT DOES

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:53.808
SEEM TO BE INCOME

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.343
AND WITH THE INTENT OF OF THE

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:57.245
THE STATUTE ITSELF.

01:26:57.312 --> 01:26:59.480
I WANT MY COMMENTS THERE AND.

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:00.081
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:13.795
SO LITTLE NO MORE DETAIL ON THE

01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:15.763
STATE OF THE MARKET ITSELF AND

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:16.164
THE CARBON MARKET.

01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:17.465
.

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:19.033
I DON'T KNOW TO WHICH OF YOU

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.603
THIS IS BEST DIRECTED BUT.

01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:23.805
LIQUIDITY BROUGH LIKE VOLUME A

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:24.973
BILATERAL TRADING WHEN WE

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:26.674
ACTUALLY SEEING IN THE CAR

01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:28.610
MARKET IS THIS IT. IS A ROBUST

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:30.712
MARKETPLACE RIGHT NOW OUR DOES

01:27:30.778 --> 01:27:31.045
IT FEEL LIKE.

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:32.246
.

01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:34.248
STRICTLY A COMPLIANCE MARKET

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:36.417
SORT OF WITHOUT I KNOW THERE'S A

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:37.452
LOT OF FOLKS LOOKING

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:38.553
CALIFORNIA'S WOULDN'T MAKE SOME

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:40.088
INVESTMENT DETERMINATIONS AND.

01:27:40.154 --> 01:27:42.123
AND LOOK AT IT FROM A TRUE

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:43.591
MARKET INVESTMENT PERSPECTIVE

01:27:43.658 --> 01:27:45.193
NOT NOT LIKE A REGULATE IT AND

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:46.928
HE WOULD LOOK AT IT. WHAT ARE WE

01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:48.363
SEEING IN THAT LANDSCAPE HOW

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:50.098
MANY NEW PLAYERS ARE ARE GETTING

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:51.966
ENGAGED IN THAT CALIFORNIA

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:53.368
CARBON MARKET IN?

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:54.268
AND AND YOU KNOW SORT OF WHAT IS

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:55.570
THE STATE OF.

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:57.805
OF THAT SORT A SECONDARY MARKET

01:27:57.872 --> 01:27:59.007
LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WE

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:00.708
DON'T WE DIDN'T GET NEW

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:01.843
INFORMATION TODAY ABOUT THE

01:28:01.909 --> 01:28:02.810
AUCTION I'M ASSUMING THAT CAN

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:04.946
YESTERDAY SENATOR RIGHT SO SO

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:07.715
DID WE DO WE HAVE. ANY AND I

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:09.017
KNOW THAT'S THE THOSE OF THE

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:10.485
COMPLIANCE ALLOWANCES BUT SURELY

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:14.322
SECONDARILY MORE ACTIVITY. THREE

01:28:14.389 --> 01:28:15.089
IF YOU TAKE ON THAT.

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:15.757
SO SO I THINK THE FIRST THING TO

01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:16.858
SAY SENATOR IS THAT THERE'S NO

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:18.626
PUBLIC DATA ON SECONDARY MARKET

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:19.827
BEHAVIOR AND THAT'S ALL THROUGH

01:28:19.894 --> 01:28:21.396
PRIVATE DATA SERVICES I DON'T

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:22.897
HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO ANY OF

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:24.365
THAT RIGHT NOW. WHEN YOU READ

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:25.533
SUMMARY REPORTS FROM THOSE

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.201
INDIVIDUALS TRAINING SECTION AND

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:28.803
QUITE THIN RECENTLY. I THINK TO

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:30.071
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHO'S

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.873
ENGAGING IN THE MARKET ONE OF

01:28:31.939 --> 01:28:32.507
THE MOST IMPORTANT.

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:34.542
DATA POINTS TO GIVE YOU IS THAT

01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:36.044
A TYPICAL AUCTION INCLUDING THE

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:37.378
MAY AUCTION THE RESULTS CAME OUT

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:38.913
YESTERDAY. FEATURES AROUND

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:40.048
NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE

01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:41.949
ALLOWANCES BEEN PURCHASED BY

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:43.351
COMPLIANCE ENTITY WAS SO MOST OF

01:28:43.418 --> 01:28:44.519
THE PEOPLE BUYING MOSTLY LANCE'S

01:28:44.585 --> 01:28:46.087
ARE BEING BOUGHT BY ENTITIES

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:47.488
THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROGRAM.

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:48.990
AND THERE'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.124
THAT'S BEEN BOUGHT BY PEOPLE WHO

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:51.693
ARE THIRD PARTIES THAT MIGHT BE

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:53.161
PROVIDING LIQUIDITY OR OTHER

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:54.862
SORTS OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:56.230
THAT YOU SEE IN TYPICAL MARKET

01:28:56.297 --> 01:28:57.365
PLACES SO IT'S. IT'S PRETTY WELL

01:28:57.432 --> 01:28:59.267
DOMINATED BY THE THE PURCHASING

01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:00.935
AND TRADING BEHAVIOR OF THE

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:02.704
REGULATED ENTITIES RATHER THAN

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.372
THIRD PARTY PARTICIPANTS.

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:05.640
BUT THERE ARE OTHER BENEFITS TO

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:07.041
MORE LIQUIDITY IN OUR MARKET

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:09.544
AMEND KNOWING IN TYPICAL MARKETS

01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:11.612
YOU WANT. EASY ENTRY EXIT AND

01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:13.481
SORT OF LIKE.

01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:15.283
QUICK YOU KNOW A LOT BUT BROAD.

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:16.584
AND

01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:18.619
DISTRIBUTION A RISK AMONG MORE

01:29:18.686 --> 01:29:19.854
PLAYERS BUT DO YOU THINK THERE'S

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:21.255
A REASON THIS MARKET SHOULD BE

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:23.725
DIFFERENT FOR.

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:24.826
I THINK TO BE HONEST SENATOR

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:26.394
MIGHT MY MY OWN PERSONAL VIEW IS

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:27.462
THAT THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF

01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:28.730
UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

01:29:28.796 --> 01:29:29.764
THE AB THREE NINETY EIGHT

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:31.132
PROCESS IS JUST BEGINNING WE'RE

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.467
TALKING ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:33.701
QUESTIONS AS TO PROGRAM

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:35.403
STRINGENCY. WHERE THINGS HAVE

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:36.437
GONE VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS

01:29:36.504 --> 01:29:37.772
AND IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME FOR

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:40.842
THIRD PARTY INVESTORS TO ENGAGE

01:29:40.908 --> 01:29:42.043
WITH LONG TERM STRATEGIES?

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:44.145
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ENTITIES

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:45.246
THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE CAP AND

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:46.848
TRADE PROGRAM MY TEAM AND I

01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:48.382
BELIEVE WE CONTINUE TO SEE ALL

01:29:48.449 --> 01:29:49.717
THE ALLOWANCES BEEN PURCHASED

01:29:49.784 --> 01:29:51.185
AND THE SIZE OF THE PRIVATE BANK

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:52.987
GROWING OVER TIME. WHICH

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:53.888
SUGGESTS THAT AT LEAST IN THE

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:55.690
NEAR TERM COMPLIANCE ENTITIES

01:29:55.757 --> 01:29:56.491
ARE SAYING WILL TAKE MORE

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:58.092
ALLOWANCES NOW EVEN THOUGH WE

01:29:58.159 --> 01:29:59.627
DON'T NEED THEM RIGHT NOW.

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:00.728
IS AGAIN EMISSIONS UNDER THE

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:02.163
PROGRAM ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.065
THAN CURRENT CAP LEVELS GET ALL

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:05.032
OF THE ALLOWANCES ARE BEING

01:30:05.099 --> 01:30:06.434
PURCHASED AND AGAIN THAT'S

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:08.169
CONSISTENT WITH THIS NOTION THAT.

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:09.403
PEOPLE ARE BANKING AND SAVING AT

01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:10.872
LEAST SOME.

01:30:10.938 --> 01:30:12.340
THERE'S A QUESTION OF HOW MANY

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:12.940
THEY'LL SAVE OVER THE NEXT

01:30:13.007 --> 01:30:14.509
SEVERAL YEARS AND AS TO THE

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:15.276
DISCUSSION EVERYONE'S BEEN

01:30:15.343 --> 01:30:17.211
HAVING WHAT THAT MEANS TO THE

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:18.613
LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE PROGRAM.

01:30:18.679 --> 01:30:20.181
BUT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:21.616
THERE IS AT LEAST A SHORT TERM

01:30:21.682 --> 01:30:23.785
ACCESS THE THE ROLE FOR EXTRA

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:25.686
LIQUIDITY IS IT DOESN'T STRIKE

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:26.888
ME AS A FUNDAMENTAL CONSTRAINT

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:28.222
BUT A HEALTHY MARKET WILL HAVE A

01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:29.590
VERY LIQUID MARKET ITS SO IT'S

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:31.425
IRONIC THOUGH. THAT IN THE NEAR

01:30:31.492 --> 01:30:33.060
TERM WE HAVE ALL THE THERE'S

01:30:33.127 --> 01:30:35.196
DISCUSSION EXCESS AND AND AND

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:36.164
NOT ALLOWED OUTSIDE ENTRANCE BUT

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:38.533
THEN NO LONGER MEDIUM TERM.

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:39.500
CONSERVE OUR PRICE SPIKES WERE

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:40.234
YOU ACTUALLY COULD GET SOME

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:41.736
BENEFITS THAT ENHANCE THE

01:30:41.803 --> 01:30:43.971
QUALITY SO HARD. WITH THAT

01:30:44.038 --> 01:30:44.672
BRIDGE LOOK LIKE AND.

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:46.107
MEAN WHAT IT.

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:48.209
SHOULD WE BE ENDEAVORING FOR

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:49.277
THAT KIND OF MARKET IN

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:51.078
CALIFORNIA IN YOUR VIEW DO WE

01:30:51.145 --> 01:30:53.281
WANT MORE THAN JUST COMPLIANCE

01:30:53.347 --> 01:30:54.382
ENTITIES IN OUR MARKETPLACE OR

01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:55.850
IS THERE ARE THERE OTHER UPSIDES

01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:57.018
TO THAT.

01:30:57.084 --> 01:30:58.653
IT FROM FROM A RECENT ALLEGATION

01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:00.221
PERSPECTIVE WARS THAT CHARTER

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:01.155
RELEVANCE TO.

01:31:01.222 --> 01:31:03.257
.

01:31:03.324 --> 01:31:04.692
IF THE SUN THE THE PRICE RISK

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:05.793
SIDE IS THAT.

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.328
NOT REALLY A FACTOR

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:10.431
WE JUST THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:12.366
I MEAN I I'M NOT SURE I I GUESS

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:13.701
THAT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT

01:31:13.768 --> 01:31:14.802
THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION EXACTLY

01:31:14.869 --> 01:31:17.772
AND I GUESS THE WAY WE WOULD

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:18.773
PROBABLY THINK ABOUT IT IS.

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.108
I THOUGHT WHAT'S NECESSARY FOR

01:31:21.175 --> 01:31:22.710
KIND OF PRICES TO REFLECT THE

01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:23.711
KIND OF INCENTIVES THAT ARE

01:31:23.778 --> 01:31:25.479
NEEDED TO ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:26.247
MEET ITS GOALS SO IT YOU KNOW

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.149
ARE. BASICALLY I I AND I DON'T

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:29.984
KNOW WHAT FORM OF MARKET THAT

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:31.285
TAKES NECESSARILY I MEAN I THINK

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:32.520
THAT'S.

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:33.721
I OFTENTIMES SORT OF SCENE OF

01:31:33.788 --> 01:31:34.589
ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:35.990
SORT OF THE ADDITIONAL PLAYERS

01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:37.425
IN THE MARKET IS THAT MAYBE IT

01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:38.960
COULD SORT OF HELP FACILITATE.

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:40.328
SOME THE PRICE DISCOVERY IN THE

01:31:40.394 --> 01:31:41.362
PRICES MADE WHAT JUST BETTER

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:42.964
REFLECT SORT OF THE THE VALUE

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:44.498
GOING FORWARD IN THAT PROVIDES

01:31:44.565 --> 01:31:45.499
THE APPROPRIATE SENATE'S NEEDED

01:31:45.566 --> 01:31:47.635
TO ACHIEVE THAT THE GOALS THAT

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:48.836
ARE SET OUT IN SO. WHY NOT THAT

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:50.004
INCLUDES YOU KNOW A LOT MORE

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:51.939
PLAYERS I I GUESS I DON'T REALLY

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:54.208
KNOW EXACTLY BUT THAT'S I THINK

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:54.809
OF HOW WE WOULD TEND TO THINK

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:56.444
ABOUT IT?

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:57.812
DID YOU GUYS GO THROUGH THE

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:59.380
RESULT TILL THE OPTION NO THERE

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:00.615
WAS NO CAN YOU GIVE US A LITTLE

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:01.649
FEEDBACK WHAT WHAT WHAT DO WE

01:32:01.716 --> 01:32:03.251
SEE YESTERDAY WHAT WHAT WHAT

ALLOWANCES YOU KNOW LITTLE LESS

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.135

01:32:51.899 --> 01:32:52.767
LAST AUCTION.

SEVENTY PERCENT AROUND THE

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:04.545

01:33:07.014 --> 01:33:09.483
TWELVE CENTS ABOVE THE FLOOR

FOURTEEN SIXTY FIVE.

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:16.824
FORCE FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE.

I JUST HAD JUST VERY BRIEFLY ON

01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:25.099
THAT SENATOR THIS AGAIN THIS

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:26.167
DISCUSSION THERE'S AT SOME

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:27.268
DISCUSSION THAT THE AUCTION IS A

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:28.903
SELF CORRECTING VEHICLE THAT

01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:30.738
REDUCES OVER ALLOCATION. AND

01:33:30.805 --> 01:33:31.505
AGAIN THAT THE NUMBERS JUST

01:33:31.572 --> 01:33:33.040
AREN'T THERE SO WAS DOCTOR BROWN

01:33:33.107 --> 01:33:35.176
TESTIFIED THE UNSOLD ALLOWANCES

01:33:35.242 --> 01:33:36.143
FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:37.378
TWENTY SEVENTEEN PRICE COLLAPSE

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:38.713
ARE BEING REINTRODUCED. AND

01:33:38.779 --> 01:33:40.281
THEY'RE ALL BEING PURCHASED.

01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:41.749
THERE'LL BE A MODEST NUMBER

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:43.317
THAT WON'T BE PURCHASED

01:33:43.384 --> 01:33:44.785
AND IT'S JUST NOT THAT BIG OF A

01:33:44.852 --> 01:33:45.886
DEAL IN TERMS OF THE OVER

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:47.421
ALLOCATION CALCULATIONS PEOPLE

01:33:47.488 --> 01:33:49.056
TALKING ABOUT SORT WE SAW. IN

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:50.658
THE RESULTS YESTERDAY WAS A

01:33:50.725 --> 01:33:52.093
RELATIVELY HEALTHY DEMAND PEOPLE

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:53.561
BOUGHT ALL OF THE CURRENT YEAR

01:33:53.627 --> 01:33:55.196
ALLOWANCES THOSE ADVANCED

01:33:55.262 --> 01:33:56.130
ANNOUNCES THAT THEY DIDN'T

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:57.698
PURCHASE DON'T GO AWAY THE BE

01:33:57.765 --> 01:33:59.000
MADE AVAILABLE IN THREE YEARS.

01:33:59.066 --> 01:34:00.468
SO DEMAND WEAKENED SLIGHTLY

01:34:00.534 --> 01:34:01.635
THERE BUT WE SAW THE MARKET

01:34:01.702 --> 01:34:02.203
BASICALLY ABSORB ALL OF THE

01:34:02.269 --> 01:34:02.436
SUPPLY.

01:34:02.503 --> 01:34:04.572
ACTUALLY.

01:34:04.638 --> 01:34:05.573
INCLUDING AGAIN THE PREVIOUSLY

01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:07.508
UNSOLD ALLOWANCES

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:08.042
SO AGAIN THIS THIS BANK IS

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:10.845
GROWING.

01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:13.114
NO LACK OF DEMAND.

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.849
NO ACADEMIA I MEAN I CONFIDENCE

01:34:14.915 --> 01:34:16.117
AT LEAST IN THE MARKET IN THAT

01:34:16.183 --> 01:34:17.718
REGARD IT I MEAN.

01:34:17.785 --> 01:34:19.286
AND EH AT LEAST FROM THE

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:20.488
COMPLIANCE ENTITIES A HEALTHY.

01:34:20.554 --> 01:34:23.357
.

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:25.359
THE MOTIVATION TO PARTICIPATE

01:34:25.426 --> 01:34:26.694
BUT YOU'RE SAYING YEAH WE JUST

01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:28.262
DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT.

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:30.664
THE FUTURE TO KNOW BEYOND THIS

01:34:30.731 --> 01:34:31.732
IS KIND OF PERIOD WHAT'S GONNA

01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:33.300
HAPPEN TO PRICES IN THE FUTURE I

01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:34.535
THINK THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT

01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:35.770
THIS IS THAT IF YOU HAVE THE

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:36.804
OPTION TO BUY A TODAY'S LOW

01:34:36.871 --> 01:34:38.305
PRICES.

01:34:38.372 --> 01:34:39.440
AND TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:40.474
YOU NEED RIGHT NOW THAT LOOKS

01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:41.876
LIKE A BAT.

01:34:41.942 --> 01:34:43.811
ARE THAT YOU CAN PLACE IF THE

01:34:43.878 --> 01:34:45.613
MARKET TIGHTENS AGAIN MOST

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:46.213
ANALYSTS THINK EVENTUALLY WILL

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:47.415
TIGHTEN.

01:34:47.481 --> 01:34:49.316
WHETHER OR NOT IT GETS TIGHT

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:50.418
BECAUSE WE DEAL WITH THE OVER

01:34:50.484 --> 01:34:51.786
ALLOCATION PROBLEM OR WE JUST

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:53.754
WAIT. AND WAIT WAIT WAIT

01:34:53.821 --> 01:34:54.488
EVENTUALLY THE MARKET'S GONNA

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:55.790
TIGHT SO THERE'S A KIND OF THAT

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:57.525
ONE CAN PLACE.

01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:58.826
AND WITH PRICES WHERE THE ARMY

01:34:58.893 --> 01:35:00.294
ARE YOU SEEING ON THE OFFSET

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:02.496
SIDE WHAT WHERE WE'RE PRICES

01:35:02.563 --> 01:35:04.899
THERE RIGHT NOW FOR. FOR

01:35:04.965 --> 01:35:06.400
COMPLIANCE OFFSETS THOSE ARE

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:07.701
THOSE ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRACKED

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:09.737
IN ANYWAY SO THOSE ARE BASICALLY

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:11.072
PRIVATELY TRADED I DON'T HAVE

01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:11.839
ANY OF THE ACTION MEAN DID

01:35:11.906 --> 01:35:13.040
BILLION THOSE MARKET ANALYSTS

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:14.975
OUT THERE I MEAN TODAY HAVE SORT

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:15.943
OF ESTIMATED.

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:18.446
PRICES IN VARIOUS

01:35:18.512 --> 01:35:20.081
INSTRUMENTS I MEAN DO WE ARE

01:35:20.147 --> 01:35:21.982
LACKING THAT DATA SHOULD WE BE.

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:23.184
TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT AS

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:24.351
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT IF

01:35:24.418 --> 01:35:25.820
YOU COMPARE THIS TO FOR EXAMPLE

01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:26.921
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

01:35:26.987 --> 01:35:28.289
WHICH IS ACTUALLY SET UP LIKE AN

01:35:28.355 --> 01:35:29.457
EMISSIONS TRADING MARKET THERE'S

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:30.791
A LOT OF TRADING ACTIVITY THAT'S

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:32.526
PUBLICLY REPORTED BY THE BOARD.

01:35:32.593 --> 01:35:33.794
THERE'S NO SECONDARY MARKET DATA

01:35:33.861 --> 01:35:34.795
THAT'S REPORTED.

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:36.530
THROUGH GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:37.898
THAT'S NOT ON A FEDERAL LEVEL

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:39.033
THAT'S NOT REQUIRED LIKE THROUGH

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.901
THE CFTC OR SOME COME OUT IT YOU

01:35:40.968 --> 01:35:42.436
KNOW. I MEAN WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:35:42.503 --> 01:35:44.805
THIS FEDERALLY BUT THERE'S NO

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:46.340
FROM SEC OR.

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:48.042
CFTC PERSPECTIVE NO OBLIGATION

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:49.510
FOR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES DO

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:51.679
THAT KIND OF COMMODITY FUTURES

01:35:51.745 --> 01:35:53.147
TRADING DISCLOSURE AYE MINIMUM

01:35:53.214 --> 01:35:54.515
AYE DEPTH HERE AGAIN I THOUGHT

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:55.649
PART OF THE PART OF THE GOAL OF

01:35:55.716 --> 01:35:56.917
THIS PROGRAM WAS TO KEEP IT

01:35:56.984 --> 01:35:58.652
OUTSIDE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:00.387
OR WHAT BUT I DON'T. YEAH SO MY

01:36:00.454 --> 01:36:01.288
KNOWLEDGE THERE ARE NO REQUIRING

01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:03.324
IF THERE'S ANY CHECK ON THAT AT

01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:03.491
ALL.

01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:03.624
.

01:36:03.691 --> 01:36:05.259
OKAY.

01:36:05.326 --> 01:36:07.761
.

01:36:07.828 --> 01:36:09.230
LET'S REMIND MY MAIN QUESTIONS

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:10.731
AT THIS POINT. RIGHT THANK YOU

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:12.199
IDEA.

01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:14.135
IT'S SOMETHING A LITTLE OUTSIDE

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:14.935
OF THE A BOXER YOUR.

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:16.937
.

01:36:17.004 --> 01:36:18.439
THE INTERESTS OF HANK KEEPING A

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:19.473
CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSION GOING TO

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:21.041
ACTUALLY.

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:23.077
ASK ANYONE FROM THE AUDIENCE IF

01:36:23.144 --> 01:36:23.944
THEY HAD ANY QUESTIONS FOR.

01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:26.480
THE EARLIER PRESENTER AND SO I

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:26.680
WOULD.

01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:28.115
.

01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:29.049
IN THE INTERESTS OF.

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:30.284
NOW

01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:33.154
FAIRNESS I WOULD ASK ANYONE

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:34.054
WANTING TO ASK ANY OF THESE.

01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:36.223
PRISONERS ANY QUESTIONS TO

01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:38.058
SPEND ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:39.693
YEAH IF ANYONE WANTS TO US STEP

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:40.861
FORWARD.

01:36:40.928 --> 01:36:44.698
AND DO SO.

01:36:44.765 --> 01:36:46.066
ALRIGHT THAT'S CREATIVE.

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:47.701
YEAH NANO.

01:36:47.768 --> 01:36:50.371
CENA SCENE THAT NO ONE HAS ANY

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:52.506
QUESTIONS FOR FOLKS APPEAR. AB

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:54.108
ANY CLOSING COMMENTS OF FROM THE

01:36:54.175 --> 01:36:55.676
BALANCE HERE.

01:36:55.743 --> 01:36:56.777
I YES THANK YOU MISTER GARCIA

01:36:56.844 --> 01:36:58.512
ARE I THINK.

01:36:58.579 --> 01:36:59.780
I JUST ONE ECHO I THINK BOTH

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:01.549
PROFESSOR CARLSON A DOCTOR BROWN

01:37:01.615 --> 01:37:02.883
TALKED ABOUT TRADE OFFS IN THE

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:03.784
PROGRAM AND I WANNA CALL IT IS

01:37:03.851 --> 01:37:05.586
AN ECONOMIST INSERTED REQUIRED

01:37:05.653 --> 01:37:06.654
TO TELL YOU THERE ARE TRADE OFFS.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:07.922
BUT ONE TRADE OFF I THINK WE

01:37:07.988 --> 01:37:08.989
REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT MUCH

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:10.524
MORE CLEARLY AND THAT IS WE'RE

01:37:10.591 --> 01:37:11.358
DOING THIS WHOLE PROCESS IN

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:12.693
REVERSE WE'RE DOING THIS IN

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.328
BACKWARDS ORDER.

01:37:14.395 --> 01:37:16.363
SO THE SCOPING PLAN PACKET HAVE

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:17.598
AFTER ALL THAT THE BIG HEAVY

01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:18.999
LIFT TO PASS AB THREE NINETY

01:37:19.066 --> 01:37:20.201
EIGHT HAPPENS LAST YEAR IN JULY

01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:21.702
THE SCOPING PLANK IT'S FINALIZED

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:23.971
NOVEMBER DECEMBER. THE SCOPING

01:37:24.038 --> 01:37:25.706
PLAN SAYS FORTY SEVEN PERCENT.

01:37:25.773 --> 01:37:26.440
A THE MISSION REDUCTIONS IN

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:27.474
TWENTY THIRTY ARE GONNA COME

01:37:27.541 --> 01:37:28.876
FROM CAP AND TRADE.

01:37:28.943 --> 01:37:30.611
NOW WE'RE DESIGNING A REGULATION

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:32.112
THERE IS NO ANALYSIS EITHER IN

01:37:32.179 --> 01:37:33.347
THE SCOPING PLAN OR IN THE

01:37:33.414 --> 01:37:34.748
INFORMAL PART THE REGULATORY

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:35.683
PROCESS THAT HAS THUS FAR

01:37:35.749 --> 01:37:37.318
OCCURRED. THAT CONNECTS HOW THE

01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:38.886
MARKET DESIGN SELECTED BY THE

01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:40.321
BOARD WILL ACHIEVE ANYTHING

01:37:40.387 --> 01:37:41.956
RESEMBLING THAT LEVEL OF

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:43.924
AMBITION. NOW MAYBE WE CAN HAVE

01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:45.359
A GOOD FUND TECHNICAL DEBATE

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:46.460
ABOUT THIS BUT THERE'S LITERALLY

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:48.429
NO ANALYSIS OR INFORMATION.

01:37:48.495 --> 01:37:49.763
AND THAT IS A STRIKING THING TO

01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:51.198
SAY ABOUT THE MOST PROMINENT

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:53.467
CARBON MARKET IN THE WORLD.

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:54.702
AND THE LAST THING I THINK I

01:37:54.768 --> 01:37:55.936
WANNA SAY ABOUT THIS IS IS AGAIN

01:37:56.003 --> 01:37:57.271
TO ADMIT PROFESSOR KRAUSS

01:37:57.338 --> 01:37:57.938
ANYTHING MADE A VERY GOOD POINT

01:37:58.005 --> 01:37:59.473
WHICH IS. IT MAY BE THAT

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.941
RESOLVING OVER ALLOCATION WILL

01:38:01.008 --> 01:38:02.509
INCREASE MARKET PRICES.

01:38:02.576 --> 01:38:04.078
DOCTOR BROWN POINTS OUT THAT

01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:05.346
AGAIN THERE ARE PRICE CONTROL

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:06.347
MECHANISMS THAT THE BOARD CAN

01:38:06.413 --> 01:38:07.815
IMPLEMENT TO CONTROL THOSE

01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:09.283
PRICES WERE THE BOARD DEEMS FIT

01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:10.618
TO BALANCE ALL THOSE INTERESTS.

01:38:10.684 --> 01:38:11.885
BUT THE BOARD DESIGNS A PROGRAM

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:13.120
THAT DOESN'T DELIVER ON THE

01:38:13.187 --> 01:38:14.388
ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS THERE'S A

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:16.090
CONSISTENCY PROBLEM WITH RESPECT

01:38:16.156 --> 01:38:17.458
TO THE BALANCE BETWEEN CAP AND

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:19.093
TRADE AND REGULATIONS IN THE

01:38:19.159 --> 01:38:19.727
SCALP IMPLANT WAS APPROVED LAST

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:20.494
YEAR.

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:23.764
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:25.232
THANK YOU A I GUESS THE ONLY

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:26.400
THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT.

01:38:26.467 --> 01:38:29.503
TO STATE THE OBVIOUS US IS

01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:31.138
EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX

01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:32.706
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO

01:38:32.773 --> 01:38:33.340
THINK IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT IS

01:38:33.407 --> 01:38:34.375
THAT.

01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:36.710
WE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS TO DATE

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:37.444
AND.

01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:39.713
OR IN AN ENVIABLE POSITION AND

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.514
A LOT OF RESPECTS AND THAT.

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:42.516
.

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:43.617
EMISSIONS HAVE DECLINED AT A

01:38:43.684 --> 01:38:44.952
RATE FASTER THAN WHAT WE

01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:48.088
EXPECTED PRICES HAVE STAYED LOW

01:38:48.155 --> 01:38:48.689
AND THE AMOUNTS MARKETS WHICH

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:50.391
HAS.

01:38:50.457 --> 01:38:52.159
BENEFITS AND THAT OUR COMMODITY

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:53.694
PRICES ARE NOT ROTH OF RAPIDLY

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:55.896
RISING OUR ECONOMY HAS GROWN.

01:38:55.963 --> 01:38:57.998
AND SO YOU KNOW.

01:38:58.065 --> 01:38:59.433
THAT WE SHOULD TAKE SOME COMFORT

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.502
IN THE FACT THAT IN THE FIRST.

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:03.404
SIX YEARS OF THE PROGRAM WE'VE

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:05.806
SEEN EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESSES AND

01:39:05.873 --> 01:39:07.808
I THINK YOU KNOW THE JOB OF THIS

01:39:07.875 --> 01:39:09.777
COMMITTEE AGAIN AS TO. TO MAKE

01:39:09.843 --> 01:39:13.047
SURE THAT CARP CONTINUES ON PACE

01:39:13.113 --> 01:39:14.348
TWO AND TO AND PROVIDE THE KIND

01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:15.983
OF INFORMATION NECESSARY TO

01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:18.018
ALLOW. THE KINDS OF ASSESSMENTS

01:39:18.085 --> 01:39:19.019
THAT I THINK THEY'RE GOING ON BY

01:39:19.086 --> 01:39:20.587
THIRD PARTIES RIGHT NOW IN A WAY

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:22.056
THAT I THINK IS HEALTHY AND

01:39:22.122 --> 01:39:24.124
CONSTRUCTIVE AND SO. PART OF IT

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:25.459
AGAIN WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:39:25.526 --> 01:39:27.328
IS JUST TO COMMAND THE PROCESS

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:28.729
WHICH I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:29.463
ONE WE SOMETIMES THINK MORE

01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:30.564
ABOUT THE SUBSYSTEM LEAD ABOUT

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:31.598
THE PROCESS.

01:39:31.665 --> 01:39:32.900
BUT FOR ME AS SOMEBODY WHO

01:39:32.966 --> 01:39:33.467
THINKS A LOT ABOUT PROCESS.

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:35.302
I THINK

01:39:35.369 --> 01:39:36.737
THAT THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY

01:39:36.804 --> 01:39:39.106
PROCESS TO HAVE VERY CLEAR

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:41.008
DIALOGUE BEFORE SOME OF THESE

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:43.677
PROBLEMS MIGHT ACTUALLY OCCUR.

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:44.745
AND TO BE AND TO HAVE YOU KNOW

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:46.113
I'D APPRECIATE FOR EXAMPLE

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.648
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO ASK QUESTIONS

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:49.650
OF THE WITNESSES. NOT JUST THOSE

01:39:49.717 --> 01:39:50.751
SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:52.553
HERE AND SO I WOULD JUST

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:54.221
ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE THIS

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:56.156
BACK AND FORTH PROCESS WHERE. WE

01:39:56.223 --> 01:39:57.424
GET AS MUCH INFORMATION ON THE

01:39:57.491 --> 01:39:58.992
TABLE AS WE CAN WE GET AS MUCH

01:39:59.059 --> 01:40:00.861
ANALYSIS WE CAN NOT JUST FROM

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:02.930
CAR BUT FROM. OUTSIDE PARTIES

01:40:02.996 --> 01:40:04.431
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:05.132
SO FORTH SO.

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:09.303
SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:10.738
JUST WHAT IT WILL LOOK EXCUSE ME

01:40:10.804 --> 01:40:12.706
WILL THAT CONTINUE TO MONITOR

ALLOW ITS PRICES WITHIN A

NOW BELOW ALLOWANCE PRICES AND

01:43:17.124 --> 01:43:19.359
SO THAT'S A CLEAR INDICATION.

01:43:19.426 --> 01:43:19.560
THAT.

01:43:19.626 --> 01:43:21.061
.

01:43:21.128 --> 01:43:23.063
THE MARKET CONTINUES TO BE.

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:28.502
IF THERE WERE ACCESS OUTSIDE

01:43:28.569 --> 01:43:29.503
SOME OUTSIDE SUPPLY YOU WOULD

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:31.738
SEE A DIVERGENCE IN THOSE PRICES

01:43:31.805 --> 01:43:33.006
WHERE OFFSETS PLACES WOULD

01:43:33.073 --> 01:43:34.274
PRICES WOULD.

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:34.875
WOULD TAKE A DIFFERENT TRACK

01:43:34.942 --> 01:43:36.443
DOWNWARDS.

01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:38.278
AND WOULDN'T JUST TRACK RIGHT

01:43:38.345 --> 01:43:40.047
BEHIND ON THE LEVELS PRICES SO

01:43:40.113 --> 01:43:41.715
THERE'S CLEARLY A NEED. FOR FOR

01:43:41.782 --> 01:43:42.683
OFFSETS IN THE MARKET THANKS

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:49.323
VERY MUCH.

01:43:49.389 --> 01:43:49.489
I.

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:50.724
MCHALE'S WHO ARE LOW ON BEHALF

01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:52.225
OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR BY

01:43:52.292 --> 01:43:53.193
MY COUNT MOUNTS.

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:55.362
LIKE TO PICK A THANK COMMITTEE

01:43:55.429 --> 01:43:56.630
FOR HOSTING ANOTHER ON THESE

01:43:56.697 --> 01:43:58.332
OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. AND WE THINK

01:43:58.398 --> 01:43:59.833
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT.

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:01.101
THE CAP AND TRADE IS NOT THE

01:44:01.168 --> 01:44:02.436
SOLE COSTA CARBON AND

01:44:02.502 --> 01:44:03.770
CALIFORNIA'S MARKET.

01:44:03.837 --> 01:44:06.139
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS

01:44:06.206 --> 01:44:07.841
THAT THAT ALL COME AT ADDITIONAL

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:08.775
COSTS

01:44:08.842 --> 01:44:10.410
A CAP AND TRADE IS DESIGNED TO

01:44:10.477 --> 01:44:12.212
BE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND.

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:13.780
ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT WAY TO

01:44:13.847 --> 01:44:16.149
ACHIEVE REDUCTIONS AS SUCH IT IT

01:44:16.216 --> 01:44:17.784
DOES HAVE A MUCH LOWER COST A

01:44:17.851 --> 01:44:19.186
CAR BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE L.

01:44:19.252 --> 01:44:20.454
CFS MARKET OR THE RENEWABLE

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.589
PORTFOLIO STANDARD. ALL THOSE

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:24.024
COMMENTED ADDITIONAL COSTS

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:25.659
MUCH HIGHER THAN THAN WHAT THE

01:44:25.726 --> 01:44:26.893
CAP AND TRADE IS ON THE SCALE OF

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.929
OF TWO THREES SOMETIMES TEN

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:30.797
TIMES MORE.

01:44:30.864 --> 01:44:32.599
AND AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND

01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:34.134
THAT THAT THIS PROGRAM WAS BUILT

01:44:34.201 --> 01:44:36.036
AS THE COST RELIEF VALVE FOR THE

01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:38.705
ENTIRETY OF S. B. THIRTY TWO ONE

01:44:38.772 --> 01:44:39.373
AB THIRTY TWO BEFORE.

01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:41.241
.

01:44:41.308 --> 01:44:42.909
AND AND TO THAT END AIR BE DID

01:44:42.976 --> 01:44:44.211
DESIGNED THIS PROGRAM AND AND I

01:44:44.277 --> 01:44:45.445
THINK IT WAS NEGOTIATED BY

01:44:45.512 --> 01:44:46.380
STAKEHOLDERS TO KEEP THE COSTS

01:44:46.446 --> 01:44:47.848
LOW.

01:44:47.914 --> 01:44:49.750
AND SMOOTH THINGS OVER THE

01:44:49.816 --> 01:44:51.218
COURSE OF OF THE COMPLIANCE

01:44:51.284 --> 01:44:52.419
PERIODS WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE A

01:44:52.486 --> 01:44:53.987
THREE YEAR COMPLIANCE TERMS AS

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:54.721
OPPOSED TO SINGLE YOUR CENTER

01:44:54.788 --> 01:44:56.556
ENTERS. Y. WE LOOK AT THIS OVER

01:44:56.623 --> 01:44:57.891
A PERIOD OF A DECADE AS OPPOSED

01:44:57.958 --> 01:44:59.426
TO A PERIOD OF. OF YOU KNOW

01:44:59.493 --> 01:45:00.727
IMMEDIATE.

01:45:00.794 --> 01:45:01.795
NOW IN AND OUT YEARS.

01:45:01.862 --> 01:45:03.563
.

01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:05.465
TO THAT END THERE ARE MECHANISMS

01:45:05.532 --> 01:45:06.433
DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH THINGS

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.901
SUCH AS YOU KNOW. MOVING

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:10.370
ALLOWANCES ARE OUT FROM FROM THE

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:11.805
MARKET SHOULD THEY GO ON AUCTION

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:13.407
AFTER A CERTAIN. PERIOD OF TIME.

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:15.442
AND I THINK THE YOU KNOW WE

01:45:15.509 --> 01:45:17.210
CAN'T INTERCHANGEABLY SAY OVER

01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:19.246
ALLOCATION WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:20.947
TALK ABOUT SUPPLY.

01:45:21.014 --> 01:45:22.082
YOU KNOW OUR OUR ALLOCATIONS

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:23.617
WERE BASED ON.

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:26.353
FACILITY DATA UNLIKE. YOU KNOW

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:27.788
WE THIS IS NOT COMPARABLE TO

01:45:27.854 --> 01:45:29.322
REGGIE OR THE UNITY ES WHERE

01:45:29.389 --> 01:45:30.657
THERE.

01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:32.059
BUT THEY'RE NOT A MISSION

01:45:32.125 --> 01:45:32.893
ALLOCATIONS WERE BASED ON

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:34.861
CAPACITY.

01:45:34.928 --> 01:45:36.229
SO IF I HAD A HUNDRED MEGAWATT

01:45:36.296 --> 01:45:37.631
PLANT BUT AS ONLY RUNNING AT A

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:40.000
SEVENTY SEVENTY FIVE. YOU AYE I

01:45:40.067 --> 01:45:40.634
WAS BEATEN GIVEN CREDIT FOR THE

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:42.135
HUNDRED.

01:45:42.202 --> 01:45:43.070
IN CALIFORNIA YOU'RE ONLY GIVEN

01:45:43.136 --> 01:45:43.937
CREDIT FOR FOR WHAT YOU'RE

01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:45.572
PUTTING OUT.

01:45:45.639 --> 01:45:46.540
AND THAT'S WHERE THE

01:45:46.606 --> 01:45:48.008
BENCHMARKING TOOK PLACE BACK IN

01:45:48.075 --> 01:45:49.142
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:50.043
THOUSAND NINE ONE WE'RE

01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:51.845
DEVELOPING THIS PROGRAM. SO IT

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:53.113
IS NOT AN APPLE STORE YOU KNOW

01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:54.314
IT'S NOT APPLES TO APPLES

01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:56.016
COMPARISON WE TALK ALLOCATIONS.

01:45:56.083 --> 01:45:57.818
SO YEAH I DO THINK THE TERM OVER

01:45:57.884 --> 01:45:59.186
ALLOCATION IS AN APPROPRIATE USE

01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:00.520
WEEK WE CAN TALK ABOUT SUPPLY WE

01:46:00.587 --> 01:46:01.955
CAN TALK ABOUT.

01:46:02.022 --> 01:46:04.057
POTENTIAL OVERSUPPLY BUT TO TALK

01:46:04.124 --> 01:46:05.258
ABOUT OVER ALLOCATION I THINK

01:46:05.325 --> 01:46:06.693
THAT'S A COMPLETE MISNOMER IT

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:07.894
RELATES BACK TO THE TO THE

01:46:07.961 --> 01:46:09.329
CRISIS THAT THAT TOOK PLACE IN

01:46:09.396 --> 01:46:11.364
THE EU'S PROGRAM. AND IT INVOKES

01:46:11.431 --> 01:46:13.166
THAT KIND OF FEAR WE SHOULD HAVE

01:46:13.233 --> 01:46:14.167
THAT KIND OF FEAR AS WE MOVE

01:46:14.234 --> 01:46:15.769
FORWARD WE WE WE DESIGNED FOR

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:17.504
THAT. THAT WHAT THAT WAS DEALT

01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:18.905
WITH THAT THERE'S AND TO SAY

01:46:18.972 --> 01:46:20.340
THAT THERE IS NO ANALYSIS PEACE

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:21.908
BETWEEN THE SCOPING PLAN AND THE

01:46:21.975 --> 01:46:22.943
INTERACTION THE CAPTURE IS ALSO

01:46:23.009 --> 01:46:25.479
FALSE WE HAVE TEN YEARS. OF OF

01:46:25.545 --> 01:46:26.747
REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT

01:46:26.813 --> 01:46:28.949
WE HAVE INPUT FROM FROM SO MANY

01:46:29.015 --> 01:46:31.084
STAKEHOLDERS A IT IT'S JUST IT'S

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:32.619
THAT'S GOING TOO FAR IT'S A STEP

01:46:32.686 --> 01:46:34.254
TOO FAR IN THE DESCRIPTION OF

01:46:34.321 --> 01:46:35.088
HOW THIS WENT WEEK WE'VE ALL

01:46:35.155 --> 01:46:36.823
BEEN. PARTICIPATING IN THIS

01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:38.191
REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE

01:46:38.258 --> 01:46:39.092
DEVELOPMENT FOR OVER A DECADE AT

01:46:39.159 --> 01:46:40.660
THIS POINT.

01:46:40.727 --> 01:46:42.529
IT'S THEIR THEIR IN THE RECORD

01:46:42.596 --> 01:46:44.564
IS BUILT. IS GONNA CONTINUE TO

01:46:44.631 --> 01:46:45.699
BE BUILT AS WE MOVE FORWARD I

01:46:45.766 --> 01:46:46.800
THINK IS IMPORTANT AT THESE

01:46:46.867 --> 01:46:48.535
DISCUSSIONS IN HERE FROM. FROM

01:46:48.602 --> 01:46:50.170
FOLKS LIKE LIKE NEAR ZERO WHO

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:51.805
HAVE THESE CONCERNS THAT WE CAN

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:53.373
TALK ABOUT POTENTIAL CONCERNS

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.975
THERE BUT IT TO DESCRIBE IT IS

01:46:55.041 --> 01:46:56.810
OVER ALLOCATION OR TALKING ABOUT

01:46:56.877 --> 01:46:58.345
SUPPLY I THINK IS INCORRECT. AND

01:46:58.411 --> 01:46:59.479
I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE

01:46:59.546 --> 01:47:00.781
TAKE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS TO

01:47:00.847 --> 01:47:01.815
THE END.

01:47:01.882 --> 01:47:03.283
AND AND BASED ON KIND OF HOW

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:04.684
WE'RE LOOKING AT IT IF IF WE

01:47:04.751 --> 01:47:06.453
REMOVE THIS MANY ALLOWANCES NOW

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.088
IS BEING SUGGESTED BY SOME.

01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:09.923
WE END UP WAY BEYOND THE FORTY

01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.624
PERCENT BELOW.

01:47:10.690 --> 01:47:12.526
.

01:47:12.592 --> 01:47:13.794
NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS IN TWENTY

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:15.862
THIRTY AND AND. WE DON'T HAVE

01:47:15.929 --> 01:47:17.531
LEGISLATIVE MANDATE FOR THAT AND

01:47:17.597 --> 01:47:18.131
I DON'T THINK THE LEGISLATURE

01:47:18.198 --> 01:47:19.733
WANTS TO TO START LOOKING AT

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.735
THAT. UNTIL WE'VE WE'VE STARTED

01:47:21.802 --> 01:47:22.803
MOVE INTO THAT POST TWENTY

01:47:22.869 --> 01:47:24.504
TWENTY PERIOD AND WERE LOOKING

01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:26.439
DOWN THE ROAD FURTHER WE SEE THE

01:47:26.506 --> 01:47:27.073
ECONOMICS OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:28.008
GO.

01:47:28.074 --> 01:47:29.609
SO WE DID WHAT WILL FOLLOW UP

01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:30.610
WITH SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

01:47:30.677 --> 01:47:32.078
WERE GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO

01:47:32.145 --> 01:47:32.512
DIGEST.

01:47:32.579 --> 01:47:33.947
ALL THE COMMITTEES STUFF THAT

WAS PRESENTED HERE TODAY BUT WE

01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:37.584
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT

01:47:37.651 --> 01:47:38.218
THESE THINGS THROUGH THROUGH THE

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:39.319
EYES OF.

01:47:39.386 --> 01:47:41.321
OF YOU KNOW PERHAPS IT AT SOME

01:47:41.388 --> 01:47:42.422
POINT THE COMMITTEE WANTS TO

01:47:42.489 --> 01:47:43.590
HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE INPUT ON

01:47:43.657 --> 01:47:44.958
PANEL SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO COMPLY

01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:46.626
WITH THESE REGULATIONS. I THINK

01:47:46.693 --> 01:47:47.961
WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT VOICE IN

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:53.200
THIS AS WELL SO THANK YOU.

HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY.

01:47:58.205 --> 01:47:59.973
BILL MCGAVIN WITH COALITION FOR

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:02.976
CLEAN AIR WE WORK ON RESTORING

01:48:03.043 --> 01:48:04.244
CLEAN AIR FOR CALIFORNIANS AND

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:05.111
ALSO ON PREVENTING CLIMATE

01:48:05.178 --> 01:48:06.446
CHANGE.

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:08.114
WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT OVER

01:48:08.181 --> 01:48:09.149
THE LAST FEW YEARS THE

01:48:09.216 --> 01:48:11.218
LEGISLATURE UNDER YOUR

01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:13.086
LEADERSHIP CHAIRMAN GARCIA.

01:48:13.153 --> 01:48:15.822
HAS BASICALLY TRIED TO MOVE

01:48:15.889 --> 01:48:18.024
CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE PROGRAMS

01:48:18.091 --> 01:48:20.594
TO WHERE THEY WOULD ALSO.

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:22.662
PROVIDE BENEFITS PARTICLE

01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:24.464
IMPROVING AIR QUALITY FOR

01:48:24.531 --> 01:48:25.599
CALIFORNIANS.

01:48:25.665 --> 01:48:27.567
MOST OF WHOM AS YOU KNOW ARE

01:48:27.634 --> 01:48:30.036
STILL. SUFFERING FROM AIR THAT

01:48:30.103 --> 01:48:32.839
IS NOT HEALTHY TO BREEZE.

01:48:32.906 --> 01:48:35.041
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO USE

01:48:35.108 --> 01:48:36.776
THAT LANCE WHEN WE LOOK AT.

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:38.712
DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS

01:48:38.778 --> 01:48:40.080
AND ALSO DIRECT EMISSION

01:48:40.146 --> 01:48:41.815
REDUCTIONS UNDER AB ONE NINETY

01:48:41.882 --> 01:48:42.949
SEVEN SOMETHING I DON'T THINK

01:48:43.016 --> 01:48:44.451
IT'S BEEN.

01:48:44.517 --> 01:48:45.785
DISCUSSED YET THIS MORNING BUT

01:48:45.852 --> 01:48:47.354
BUT SHALL I WANT TO ADDRESS.

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:49.723
SO WE THINK AT AND WE BELIEVE

01:48:49.789 --> 01:48:52.559
THAT THE LEGISLATURE. ARE HAS

01:48:52.626 --> 01:48:54.127
INTENDED.

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:57.864
THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT OFFSETS.

01:48:57.931 --> 01:49:00.267
THAT THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDING

01:49:00.333 --> 01:49:01.568
BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:03.603
COMMUNITIES.

01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:06.373
DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS.

01:49:06.439 --> 01:49:08.241
AND THAT THOSE IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:10.810
HAVE OFFSETS IN THE PROGRAM THAT

01:49:10.877 --> 01:49:12.846
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:15.015
THAT THOSE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE

01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:16.783
NOT ONLY REDUCING GREENHOUSE

01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:19.219
GASES BUT PROVIDING THOSE OTHER

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:20.420
DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO

01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:22.122
OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:49:22.188 --> 01:49:23.356
AND THEN WE LOOK AT AB ONE

01:49:23.423 --> 01:49:25.425
NINETY SEVEN.

01:49:25.492 --> 01:49:27.260
I WAS SUGGESTS THAT THE

01:49:27.327 --> 01:49:30.397
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CLARIFY THAT

01:49:30.463 --> 01:49:33.066
DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS MEAN

01:49:33.133 --> 01:49:34.801
THOSE EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT

01:49:34.868 --> 01:49:36.870
ARE ACHIEVED BY REGULATED

01:49:36.937 --> 01:49:39.773
ENTITIES. ONSITE RATHER THAN

01:49:39.839 --> 01:49:41.942
OUTSOURCED THROUGH ALLOWANCES

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:42.275

I THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN AND

01:49:49.015 --> 01:49:50.917
MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE.

01:49:50.984 --> 01:49:52.352
MICHAEL SOCK CALIFORNIA

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:53.820
MANUFACTURES TECHNOLOGY

01:49:53.887 --> 01:49:55.088
ASSOCIATION I WANTED TO

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:56.790
ASSOCIATE MANY MY COMMENTS WITH

01:49:56.856 --> 01:49:58.391
A MISTRESS CARLA FROM CIBER

01:49:58.458 --> 01:50:00.760
EARLIER. AND SNOW THAT REMOVING

01:50:00.827 --> 01:50:02.329
ALLOWANCES YOU KNOW FROM THE

01:50:02.395 --> 01:50:03.964
MARKET AT THIS POINT WE KNOW

01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:05.832
WILL INCREASE THE PRICE. OF

01:50:05.899 --> 01:50:07.100
THOSE AMOUNTS IS WHICH DRIVES OF

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:08.568
THE COMPLIANCE COSTS WHICH HAS A

01:50:08.635 --> 01:50:09.636
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

01:50:09.703 --> 01:50:10.904
MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT

01:50:10.971 --> 01:50:12.605
CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF THOSE

01:50:12.672 --> 01:50:14.841
COSTS SO WE DO KNOW THAT THEIR

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:16.843
SIGNIFICANT YOU KNOW ECONOMIC

01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:18.111
CONSEQUENCES OF SOME OF THESE

01:50:18.178 --> 01:50:19.946
ACTIONS WE ALSO KNOW THAT

01:50:20.013 --> 01:50:20.914
LOOKING OUT.

01:50:20.981 --> 01:50:22.382
THAT THERE ARE.

01:50:22.449 --> 01:50:23.483
EXECUTE IF THERE'S A

01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:25.318
SIGNIFICANT TIGHTENING.

01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:27.320
OF THIS SITUATION WE GET TO THE

01:50:27.387 --> 01:50:29.356
MID TWENTY TWENTIES ROUGHLY. A

01:50:29.422 --> 01:50:30.557
WIN THOSE ALLOWANCES WILL BE

01:50:30.623 --> 01:50:32.325
NECESSARY SO REMOVING THEM FROM

01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:33.927
THE MARKET NOW ARTIFICIALLY

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:36.029
DRIVES UP PRICES TODAY.

01:50:36.096 --> 01:50:38.064
PUTS US IN A NEGATIVE POSITION.

01:50:38.131 --> 01:50:40.200
FOR THE FUTURE SO WE WOULD BE

01:50:40.266 --> 01:50:41.401
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:50:41.468 --> 01:50:43.536
PROSPECT OF REMOVING AT ANY

01:50:43.603 --> 01:50:44.137
ALLOWANCES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:50:44.204 --> 01:50:45.338
UNUSED.

01:50:45.405 --> 01:50:47.140
FROM THE MARKET NOT FOR THAT

01:50:47.207 --> 01:50:49.843
PURPOSE OF FOR FOR THOSE REASONS

01:50:49.909 --> 01:50:50.543
ADDITIONALLY.

01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:52.612
WE AND WE THINK THAT THE MARKET

01:50:52.679 --> 01:50:54.180
THE WAY IT IS WORKING TODAY AS

01:50:54.247 --> 01:50:55.582
IS INDICATED BY THE A RESULTS

01:50:55.648 --> 01:50:57.751
ARE RELEASED YESTERDAY. IS THAT

01:50:57.817 --> 01:50:59.085
THE CORE OF THE CURRENT VINTAGE

01:50:59.152 --> 01:51:00.587
AMOUNTS IS BEING COMPLETELY SOLD

01:51:00.653 --> 01:51:01.388
OUT AND.

01:51:01.454 --> 01:51:03.056
I THINK THE FUTURE VINTAGE

01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:05.125
ALLOWANCES WERE NOT ENTIRELY

01:51:05.191 --> 01:51:06.626
SOLD OUT THAT THEY'RE STILL

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:08.395
STRONG LEVEL OF INTEREST IN THAT.

01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:09.429
BEING THOSE AT THE MANY OF THOSE

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:09.629
WERE.

01:51:09.696 --> 01:51:11.831
ACQUIRED BY COMPLIANCE ENTITIES

01:51:11.898 --> 01:51:13.800
YOU KNOW ISN'T THAT THE PURPOSE

01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:15.935
OF THE SYSTEM ISN'T THE PURPOSE

01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:16.970
THAT THESE ALLOWANCES ARE

01:51:17.037 --> 01:51:18.204
AVAILABLE FOR ENTITIES THAT HAVE

01:51:18.271 --> 01:51:19.973
A COMPLIANCE OVULATION.

01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:20.707
THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

01:51:20.774 --> 01:51:22.142
INVESTMENT ENTITIES AND OTHER

01:51:22.208 --> 01:51:22.742
ENTITIES PARTICIPATING IN THE

01:51:22.809 --> 01:51:24.511
MARKET.

01:51:24.577 --> 01:51:26.079
CAN ASSIST WITH VOTE LIQUIDITY.

01:51:26.146 --> 01:51:28.548
AND FACILITATING NOT HOWEVER

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:30.483
THE PURPOSES ON THE COMPLIANCE

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:32.552
SIDE FOR BT FACTORING INTO HE

01:51:32.619 --> 01:51:34.120
OTHERS WHO HAVE THAT OBLIGATION

01:51:34.187 --> 01:51:36.156
SO. ODD GIVEN THAT THAT'S THE

01:51:36.222 --> 01:51:38.425
CASE GIVEN THAT ARE WHAT WE KNOW

01:51:38.491 --> 01:51:39.359

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:48.601
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE

01:51:48.668 --> 01:51:51.104

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:13.526
REALLY BRIEF COMMENTS AND.

01:52:13.593 --> 01:52:15.662
ESPECIALLY FOR FACILITATING THIS

ONGOING CONVERSATION.

01:52:17.063 --> 01:52:19.666
FROM ETFS PERSPECTIVE IT IS

01:52:19.732 --> 01:52:21.134
GOOD NEWSTHAT CALIFORNIA IS

01:52:21.201 --> 01:52:22.769
BELOW OUR EMISSIONS LIMIT AND

01:52:22.836 --> 01:52:24.270
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE TO MEET OUR

01:52:24.337 --> 01:52:25.572
TWENTY TWENTY TARGET.

01:52:25.638 --> 01:52:26.706
THIS IS GOOD FOR THE

01:52:26.773 --> 01:52:28.675
ENVIRONMENT IT DEMONSTRATES THE

01:52:28.741 --> 01:52:30.677
SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA'S SUITE OF

01:52:30.743 --> 01:52:32.779
CLIMATE POLICIES INCLUDING THE

01:52:32.846 --> 01:52:33.480
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.

01:52:33.546 --> 01:52:35.315
.

01:52:35.381 --> 01:52:36.950
AT THE SAME TIME BEING BELOW THE

01:52:37.016 --> 01:52:39.052
CAP PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:52:39.119 --> 01:52:40.620
INCREASE THE STATE'S AMBITION

01:52:40.687 --> 01:52:42.956

WE THINK INCREASING THIS

01:52:59.606 --> 01:53:01.174
CLIMATE AMBITION IS REALLY

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:02.442
IMPORTANT NOT ONLY TO MEET OUR

01:53:02.509 --> 01:53:04.577
TWENTY THIRTY TARGET BUT ALSO TO

01:53:04.644 --> 01:53:07.547

ALLOWANCE THAT THAT IS NOT USED

01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:26.699

MY OWN BENEFIT HAS SOME SERIOUS

01:54:16.649 --> 01:54:18.585
ISSUES BECAUSE AN OFFSET BY
